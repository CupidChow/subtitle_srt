00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:45,610
After changing,

6
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:48,200
go to the classroom immediately

7
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:50,479

Sir!

11
00:01:57,039 --> 00:01:57,759
Sir.

12
00:01:58,100 --> 00:01:59,800
What do we do with our old clothes?

13
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:01,000
Do whatever you want

14
00:02:01,020 --> 00:02:02,180
with it.

15
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:06,020
It's almost brand new.

16
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:07,280
Can I send it home?

17
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:09,470
I've made myself clear.

18
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:12,120
Do whatever you want with it.

19
00:02:12,470 --> 00:02:13,470
Understand?

20
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:22,320
Stop being pretentious.

21
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:23,510
You

22
00:02:23,730 --> 00:02:26,060
come from an imperial clan.

23
00:02:26,870 --> 00:02:28,000
I don't believe

24
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:30,000
you would keep this garbage.

25
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:32,540
Are you keeping it to raise rats in it?

26
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,400
Students, listen up!

Is this the reception area for

34
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:54,180
military students headed for Japan?

35
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:56,150
Yes.

36
00:02:57,400 --> 00:02:59,400
You're a military student too, right?

37
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:00,530
Let me introduce myself.

38
00:03:00,530 --> 00:03:01,400
I'm your classmate,

39
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:02,330
Yang Kaizhi.

40
00:03:04,590 --> 00:03:05,750
Military students

41
00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:07,630
have to dress like you?

42
00:03:09,580 --> 00:03:10,890
Aren't you Yang Aiguo?

43
00:03:15,430 --> 00:03:16,630
Do we know each other?

44
00:03:17,710 --> 00:03:19,010
You are so forgetful.

45
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:21,000
In Jingzhou,

46
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:22,560
who brought you back

47
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:24,210
from the execution ground?

48
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:29,350
I remember now.

49
00:03:29,870 --> 00:03:31,200
You are that Bannerman?

50
00:03:32,590 --> 00:03:33,710
I still remember your uncle's

51
00:03:33,710 --> 00:03:34,680
Ghost Dagger.

52
00:03:36,890 --> 00:03:38,150
You're quite capable.

53
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:39,900
Dressed like this,

54
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:41,870
looking from afar, I thought

55
00:03:41,870 --> 00:03:43,560
you were a young master from Shanghai.

56
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:44,180
Coming.

57
00:03:46,710 --> 00:03:47,590
I'm just

58
00:03:47,590 --> 00:03:48,870
lucky.

59
00:03:49,430 --> 00:03:50,280
Tell me.

60
00:03:50,430 --> 00:03:52,000
Where is the Officer-in-Charge?

61
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,120
I'm here to report.

62
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:54,400
Good for you.

63
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:55,710
Wait.

64
00:03:56,360 --> 00:03:58,240
How did you get the spot?

65
00:03:59,000 --> 00:03:59,840
Luck.

66
00:04:00,590 --> 00:04:01,790
Student Liang Xiang!

67
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:04,050
What's going on?

68
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:05,080
Who is he?

69
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,590
He's the

70
00:04:07,790 --> 00:04:08,960
Officer-in-Charge you're looking for.

71
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:10,560
Don't say we know each other.

72
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:12,040
I'll deal with him.

73
00:04:14,490 --> 00:04:15,610
What's going on?

74
00:04:18,390 --> 00:04:19,269
Who are you?

75
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:21,959
I'm student Yang Kaizhi.

76
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,720
I was recommended by Viceroy of Liangjiang's Liu Kunyi

77
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:25,800
to report here.

78
00:04:27,640 --> 00:04:29,170
Liu Kunyi recommended you?

79
00:04:30,510 --> 00:04:31,990
The Viceroy of Liangjiang

80
00:04:32,750 --> 00:04:33,990
recommended you personally?

81
00:04:33,990 --> 00:04:35,550
Yes, Sir.

82
00:04:43,510 --> 00:04:45,310
Why are you still standing here?

83
00:04:46,310 --> 00:04:47,440
You know each other?

84
00:04:47,750 --> 00:04:48,750
We...

85
00:04:52,670 --> 00:04:53,930
don't know each other.

86
00:04:54,750 --> 00:04:55,990
Not at all.

87
00:04:56,990 --> 00:04:57,990
Student Liang Xiang.

88
00:04:57,990 --> 00:04:58,870
Yes.

89
00:04:58,990 --> 00:05:00,110
You should do

90
00:05:00,110 --> 00:05:01,430
what you should do.

91
00:05:01,430 --> 00:05:02,560
Don't get involved.

92
00:05:03,630 --> 00:05:04,430
Go now.

93
00:05:06,870 --> 00:05:07,630
Understood,

94
00:05:07,630 --> 00:05:08,190
Sir.

95
00:05:12,990 --> 00:05:14,120
Yang Kaizhi, right?

96
00:05:15,130 --> 00:05:16,050
Looks like

97
00:05:16,870 --> 00:05:18,400
you have some connections.

98
00:05:19,340 --> 00:05:20,220
Tell me.

99
00:05:20,730 --> 00:05:22,430
What's your relationship with

100
00:05:22,430 --> 00:05:23,630
Mr. Liu?

101
00:05:24,630 --> 00:05:27,630
I've never met Mr. Liu.

102
00:05:27,870 --> 00:05:28,750
Stop joking.

103
00:05:29,340 --> 00:05:31,780
You were registered the last minute.

104
00:05:32,270 --> 00:05:34,200
If you don't have some connection,

105
00:05:34,750 --> 00:05:36,680
how could you have this treatment?

106
00:05:37,990 --> 00:05:39,990
This is the allowance for your family.

107
00:05:39,990 --> 00:05:41,310
This is the maintenance fee.

108
00:05:41,310 --> 00:05:42,570
This is the travel fee.

109
00:05:42,750 --> 00:05:44,310
Put it away and sign here.

110
00:05:45,190 --> 00:05:46,430
Where's the tuition fee?

111
00:05:46,430 --> 00:05:48,070
Isn't there also tuition fee?

112
00:05:48,070 --> 00:05:49,190
What's your name?

113
00:05:49,870 --> 00:05:50,870
Sir,

114
00:05:50,870 --> 00:05:51,750
my surname is Li!

115
00:05:51,750 --> 00:05:53,280
My name is Renjun, and my courtesy name is Qianli.

116
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:54,720
I a field-grade officer from Yuan Shikai's

118
00:05:54,750 --> 00:05:55,870
Wuwei Corps Right Division.

119
00:05:55,870 --> 00:05:57,190
I was ordered to go to Tokyo, Japan

120
00:05:57,190 --> 00:05:58,100
to study military.

121
00:05:58,100 --> 00:05:59,180
That's all.

122
00:06:00,510 --> 00:06:02,190
He works for Yuan Shikai.

123
00:06:02,750 --> 00:06:03,750
Your tuition fees

124
00:06:03,780 --> 00:06:05,870
will be raised by the provincial administration commissioner

125
00:06:05,870 --> 00:06:08,190
and sent directly to the school in Tokyo.

126
00:06:08,310 --> 00:06:09,070
Do you understand now?

127
00:06:09,070 --> 00:06:09,630
Yes.

128
00:06:09,990 --> 00:06:10,870
Sign it.

129
00:06:12,430 --> 00:06:13,310
Next.

130
00:06:13,650 --> 00:06:14,730
I am Gu Maichen.

131
00:06:14,390 --> 00:06:16,760
[Gu Maichen]

132
00:06:14,750 --> 00:06:15,580
I'm from Shandong.

133
00:06:15,580 --> 00:06:17,220
My student number is 027.

134
00:06:21,220 --> 00:06:22,750
How do you think

135
00:06:22,750 --> 00:06:23,990
I look in this?

136
00:06:25,310 --> 00:06:26,310
You're asking me?

137
00:06:26,430 --> 00:06:27,430
Can't I ask you?

138
00:06:29,020 --> 00:06:30,310
What do you think yourself?

139
00:06:30,310 --> 00:06:32,060
I used to feel uncomfortable

140
00:06:32,060 --> 00:06:33,310
when I see this outfit.

141
00:06:33,310 --> 00:06:33,990
Of course.

142
00:06:34,430 --> 00:06:35,220
But

143
00:06:35,550 --> 00:06:36,360
as I put it on

144
00:06:36,390 --> 00:06:37,510
myself,

145
00:06:38,190 --> 00:06:38,870
I feel

146
00:06:39,430 --> 00:06:40,550
very comfortable.

147
00:06:41,370 --> 00:06:42,170
That's right.

148
00:06:43,100 --> 00:06:45,100
No one would recognize you anymore.

149
00:06:47,110 --> 00:06:48,310
So what if they do?

150
00:06:48,820 --> 00:06:49,750
You brat.

151
00:06:49,870 --> 00:06:51,070
Don't think that you have

152
00:06:51,070 --> 00:06:51,990
my secret.

153
00:06:53,310 --> 00:06:54,190
Let me tell you.

154
00:06:54,990 --> 00:06:57,310
You're in danger now.

155
00:07:01,430 --> 00:07:02,760
Are you threatening me?

156
00:07:04,540 --> 00:07:05,740
Is this our room?

157
00:07:08,310 --> 00:07:09,950
The officer asked me to stay with you.

158
00:07:09,950 --> 00:07:11,660
My name is Li Renjun. Courtesy name, Qianli.

159
00:07:11,660 --> 00:07:14,110
I'm a field-grade officer at Yuan's Wuwei Corps Right Division.

160
00:07:14,110 --> 00:07:16,550
I heard you say that when you were receiving salary.

161
00:07:16,550 --> 00:07:17,750
You're with Mr. Yuan?

162
00:07:18,070 --> 00:07:18,590
Yes.

163
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:20,800
Mr. Yuan picked me

164
00:07:20,820 --> 00:07:21,880
from 1,000 people.

165
00:07:22,110 --> 00:07:23,190
Do you know him?

166
00:07:23,750 --> 00:07:24,990
Of course.

167
00:07:24,990 --> 00:07:25,870
The officer said

168
00:07:25,870 --> 00:07:27,430
he's imperial.

169
00:07:27,870 --> 00:07:29,430
You must be from the Jingzhou Banner.

170
00:07:29,430 --> 00:07:30,670
Imperial?

171
00:07:30,750 --> 00:07:31,550
Yes.

172
00:07:31,550 --> 00:07:33,750
His ancestor is Prince Rui, Dorgon,

173
00:07:33,870 --> 00:07:35,310
a prince regent.

174
00:07:35,310 --> 00:07:36,430
No wonder

175
00:07:36,659 --> 00:07:38,940
you're so proud.

176
00:07:39,460 --> 00:07:41,550
You really come from a big background.

177
00:07:41,550 --> 00:07:42,990
What prince regent.

178
00:07:43,310 --> 00:07:44,190
He has been

179
00:07:44,630 --> 00:07:45,750
long dethroned.

180
00:07:46,750 --> 00:07:48,280
This happened 200 year ago.

181
00:07:48,310 --> 00:07:49,909
Who would take it seriously?

182
00:07:50,470 --> 00:07:51,850
That's still a big deal.

183
00:07:51,870 --> 00:07:52,870
What big deal?

184
00:07:53,750 --> 00:07:55,310
I only found out that

185
00:07:56,310 --> 00:07:58,750
I was just a substitute when I came to Shanghai.

186
00:07:58,750 --> 00:07:59,550
A substitute?

187
00:08:00,310 --> 00:08:01,310
Substituting who?

188
00:08:01,310 --> 00:08:02,750
The imperial court ordered

189
00:08:02,750 --> 00:08:04,550
all the nobles in the capital

190
00:08:04,630 --> 00:08:06,560
to send one person to study abroad.

191
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:07,960
My place

192
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:09,670
belongs to Prince Qing.

193
00:08:11,310 --> 00:08:12,310
But they think

194
00:08:12,870 --> 00:08:13,820
studying abroad

195
00:08:13,820 --> 00:08:15,310
is something scary.

196
00:08:15,430 --> 00:08:16,890
Those who have some status

197
00:08:17,110 --> 00:08:18,170
wouldn't want to go.

198
00:08:18,170 --> 00:08:20,730
So they traced back the ancestral book

199
00:08:20,750 --> 00:08:22,870
and found me, who was far away in Jingzhou.

200
00:08:22,870 --> 00:08:24,140
I am just a substitute.

201
00:08:24,870 --> 00:08:25,990
I'm studying abroad in place

202
00:08:25,990 --> 00:08:26,870
of Prince Qing.

203
00:08:27,260 --> 00:08:29,260
But of course, for me,

204
00:08:29,990 --> 00:08:32,030
it's an honor.

205
00:08:34,390 --> 00:08:35,390
I see.

206
00:08:36,030 --> 00:08:37,270
We are all the same.

207
00:08:37,820 --> 00:08:40,100
We are both people in trouble.

208
00:08:43,620 --> 00:08:45,980
Liang Xiang, courtesy name Tufang.

209
00:08:47,740 --> 00:08:48,620
Yang Kaizhi.

210
00:08:48,620 --> 00:08:49,880
Aren't you Yang Aiguo?

211
00:08:49,980 --> 00:08:50,980
Don't mention it.

212
00:08:50,980 --> 00:08:52,390
Don't mention it ever again.

213
00:08:52,390 --> 00:08:53,620
I won't, I won't.

214
00:08:53,740 --> 00:08:54,670
I always forget.

215
00:08:56,030 --> 00:08:57,530
So you knew each other before.

216
00:08:57,530 --> 00:08:59,860
No, we don't.

217
00:09:01,270 --> 00:09:02,390
Now we know each other.

218
00:09:02,390 --> 00:09:03,620
Now we know each other.

219
00:09:03,620 --> 00:09:05,500
And you, Li Renjun,

220
00:09:05,620 --> 00:09:08,030
Yuan Shikai's favorite.

221
00:09:38,740 --> 00:09:40,620
May I ask you about someone?

222
00:09:40,820 --> 00:09:41,960
There's a student here

223
00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:43,400
named Liang...

224
00:09:52,220 --> 00:09:53,330
Young Master!

225
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:56,330
Do you remember Uncle Laixi?

226
00:09:56,620 --> 00:09:58,150
I was your grandfather's servant,

227
00:09:58,150 --> 00:09:59,740
Zhu Laixi!

228
00:10:00,390 --> 00:10:01,390
My goodness.

229
00:10:01,390 --> 00:10:02,340
Why didn't you tell me

230
00:10:02,340 --> 00:10:03,800
you're in Shanghai?

231
00:10:03,820 --> 00:10:05,740
I could take care of you, Young Master.

232
00:10:05,740 --> 00:10:06,980
Laixi, what are you doing?

233
00:10:06,980 --> 00:10:07,620
Get up.

234
00:10:07,620 --> 00:10:08,420
Young Master.

235
00:10:08,620 --> 00:10:11,030
Have you forgotten me?

236
00:10:11,390 --> 00:10:12,980
The clothes your mother birthed you in

237
00:10:12,980 --> 00:10:14,270
was buried by me

238
00:10:14,270 --> 00:10:15,950
u-under the peach tree.

239
00:10:16,620 --> 00:10:17,740
I remember you...

240
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:21,500
Don't go.

241
00:10:21,820 --> 00:10:24,060
You are my Young Master's classmates,

242
00:10:24,150 --> 00:10:26,030
so you are also my masters.

243
00:10:26,100 --> 00:10:27,500
I’ve ordered a banquet

244
00:10:27,500 --> 00:10:28,620
at Laozhengxing.

245
00:10:28,620 --> 00:10:29,680
Let's go together.

246
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:31,500
Do me a favor.

247
00:10:31,980 --> 00:10:33,100
It's inappropriate.

248
00:10:33,100 --> 00:10:34,980
Laixi is my grandfather's personal guard.

249
00:10:34,980 --> 00:10:37,030
He’s in charge of the guards in Shanghai.

250
00:10:37,030 --> 00:10:37,980
Laixi is one of us.

251
00:10:37,980 --> 00:10:39,040
Let’s go together.

252
00:10:40,740 --> 00:10:41,770
Renjun can go ahead.

253
00:10:41,770 --> 00:10:42,370
I have to go

254
00:10:42,390 --> 00:10:43,860
thank my savior later.

255
00:10:44,150 --> 00:10:45,150
I'm really sorry.

256
00:10:47,020 --> 00:10:49,020
Why was the car returned?

257
00:10:50,050 --> 00:10:52,620
According to Prince's personal guard, Yin Chang,

258
00:10:52,620 --> 00:10:53,980
Xi'an Quinsay

259
00:10:54,220 --> 00:10:56,150
had once called Prince Chun

260
00:10:56,620 --> 00:10:59,030
and told him to lay lower.

261
00:10:56,730 --> 00:10:58,810
[Shanghai Business Association member
Da Ren]

262
00:10:59,620 --> 00:11:00,500
Lay lower.

263
00:11:01,150 --> 00:11:02,500
You deliberately left this

264
00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:04,390
impression on the Shanghainese.

265
00:11:05,100 --> 00:11:06,150
After all,

266
00:11:06,150 --> 00:11:07,740
this is not a glorious trip.

267
00:11:08,100 --> 00:11:09,100
That's new.

268
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:12,740
The royal family is laying low too.

269
00:11:13,270 --> 00:11:14,670
The visit of the royal family,

270
00:11:14,670 --> 00:11:16,220
since the establishment of the Qing Dynasty,

271
00:11:16,220 --> 00:11:18,030
this is not something that has been done before.

272
00:11:18,030 --> 00:11:20,620
There comes a time where one should lay low.

273
00:11:20,740 --> 00:11:21,980
Exactly.

274
00:11:23,820 --> 00:11:25,340
It's not easy for a royal

275
00:11:25,340 --> 00:11:27,340
to come to Shanghai for a trip.

276
00:11:28,310 --> 00:11:30,670
Everyone in Shanghai wants to see him.

277
00:11:30,950 --> 00:11:32,340
So, Da Ren,

278
00:11:33,550 --> 00:11:34,790
you must invite His Highness

279
00:11:34,790 --> 00:11:37,050
to the Business Association's banquet.

280
00:11:37,150 --> 00:11:38,220
All the consulates

281
00:11:38,220 --> 00:11:39,500
want to meet them.

282
00:11:40,220 --> 00:11:41,860
We have to wash the boat

283
00:11:41,860 --> 00:11:43,150
with the river water.

284
00:11:43,270 --> 00:11:44,980
I've asked someone to send the message.

285
00:11:44,980 --> 00:11:47,070
His ship is set to sail on the 20th.

286
00:11:48,860 --> 00:11:50,860
He has four days left in Shanghai.

287
00:11:50,890 --> 00:11:51,960
Okay.

288
00:11:51,980 --> 00:11:52,620
Master.

289
00:11:54,220 --> 00:11:54,910
Master.

290
00:11:56,110 --> 00:11:57,510
Look.

291
00:11:58,090 --> 00:12:00,000
You look great in this.

292
00:12:01,820 --> 00:12:02,620
You got in?

293
00:12:02,820 --> 00:12:04,620
Yes, I did.

294
00:12:05,030 --> 00:12:06,940
A military student that is funded by the military to study in Japan.

295
00:12:06,940 --> 00:12:07,670
Very well.

296
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:09,470
Have a seat.

297
00:12:12,680 --> 00:12:13,820
It's okay, Shuhong.

298
00:12:14,270 --> 00:12:16,470
We're family. Don't stand on ceremony.

299
00:12:16,550 --> 00:12:17,700
As long as it's the Song family's boat,

300
00:12:17,700 --> 00:12:18,860
any boat will do.

301
00:12:19,170 --> 00:12:20,500
I'm just here to say hello.

302
00:12:20,500 --> 00:12:21,860
My brother-in-law

303
00:12:21,980 --> 00:12:22,860
needs help.

304
00:12:22,860 --> 00:12:24,430
I have to help him for a few days.

305
00:12:24,430 --> 00:12:27,870
[Concubine Song]

306
00:12:24,820 --> 00:12:25,920
I'll leave now.

307
00:12:26,370 --> 00:12:27,270
Master has a guest.

308
00:12:27,270 --> 00:12:28,730
Do you want to wait for him?

309
00:12:29,030 --> 00:12:30,090
I'm leaving first.

310
00:12:31,150 --> 00:12:32,950
Take care. I shan't send you off!

311
00:12:40,110 --> 00:12:40,940
Who is it?

312
00:12:41,390 --> 00:12:42,270
Who could it be?

313
00:12:42,620 --> 00:12:44,140
It's your daughter-in-law that hasn't married over

314
00:12:44,140 --> 00:12:45,940
under your first wife in Anqing.

315
00:12:46,620 --> 00:12:47,820
Song Chen is engaged?

316
00:12:48,030 --> 00:12:49,430
Look at your Song family.

317
00:12:49,550 --> 00:12:51,270
There are old and young people.

318
00:12:51,270 --> 00:12:52,620
How lively and rich.

319
00:12:52,790 --> 00:12:54,340
So lively that an old man like you

320
00:12:54,340 --> 00:12:55,620
is lost.

321
00:12:55,820 --> 00:12:56,500
Stop it.

322
00:12:57,340 --> 00:12:58,690
Bring me 2,000 yen.

323
00:12:58,860 --> 00:12:59,740
2,000 yen?

324
00:13:00,500 --> 00:13:01,170
What for?

325
00:13:01,510 --> 00:13:02,140
As a gift.

326
00:13:03,340 --> 00:13:05,800
You're a woman. Don't ask so many questions.

327
00:13:09,390 --> 00:13:10,670
It's here.

328
00:13:16,030 --> 00:13:16,790
Thank you.

329
00:13:18,740 --> 00:13:19,270
Tianbai.

330
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:21,620
You're biting off more than you can chew!

331
00:13:21,620 --> 00:13:22,390
What do you mean?

332
00:13:22,390 --> 00:13:23,500
You overestimate yourself.

333
00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:25,100
I'm overestimating myself?

334
00:13:25,100 --> 00:13:26,150
What a joke.

335
00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:27,270
Yifan.

336
00:13:27,390 --> 00:13:29,390
Am I that kind of person? You tell us.

337
00:13:29,500 --> 00:13:31,740
Prince Chun is heavily guarded in Shanghai.

338
00:13:31,740 --> 00:13:33,340
It's hard to get close to him.

339
00:13:33,500 --> 00:13:34,980
It's difficult to

340
00:13:34,980 --> 00:13:35,740
deal with him

341
00:13:35,980 --> 00:13:37,150
in broad daylight.

342
00:13:38,030 --> 00:13:39,830
If you don't want to work with me,

343
00:13:40,100 --> 00:13:40,950
then quit.

344
00:13:41,530 --> 00:13:42,860
I'll find someone else.

345
00:13:45,860 --> 00:13:46,740
Shuhong.

346
00:13:48,030 --> 00:13:49,030
Shuhong.

347
00:13:50,860 --> 00:13:52,150
Come in.

348
00:13:52,180 --> 00:13:54,180
Let me introduce a few people to you.

349
00:13:55,740 --> 00:13:56,940
Are they foreigners?

350
00:13:57,150 --> 00:13:58,340
No.

351
00:13:58,980 --> 00:14:01,020
They are shareholders of our school.

352
00:14:01,020 --> 00:14:02,550
Why don't they have braids?

353
00:14:02,770 --> 00:14:04,320
Shanghai is not like Anqing.

354
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:06,570
Western thought is more popular here, and people are more open minded.

355
00:14:06,570 --> 00:14:07,360
Those who return from studying abroad

356
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:08,620
all have their braids cut.

357
00:14:08,620 --> 00:14:10,410
Aren't they afraid of being executed?

358
00:14:10,410 --> 00:14:12,100
Although the imperial court

359
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:13,500
is prohibiting braid cutting,

360
00:14:13,500 --> 00:14:14,030
who can care

361
00:14:14,030 --> 00:14:15,740
so much now?

362
00:14:16,020 --> 00:14:18,030
They've already turned a blind eye to them.

363
00:14:18,030 --> 00:14:18,980
No one cares

364
00:14:18,980 --> 00:14:20,780
about this in our place anymore.

365
00:14:21,980 --> 00:14:22,860
Oh right,

366
00:14:23,150 --> 00:14:24,340
they think your idea

367
00:14:24,340 --> 00:14:25,340
is really good.

368
00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:27,030
They've already started recruiting them.

369
00:14:27,030 --> 00:14:27,620
Tomorrow,

370
00:14:27,620 --> 00:14:29,620
all the women who can come will come tomorrow.

371
00:14:29,620 --> 00:14:30,620
Start the class first.

372
00:14:30,620 --> 00:14:31,860
Then find a newspaper

373
00:14:31,990 --> 00:14:33,250
to publish a few news articles

374
00:14:33,250 --> 00:14:34,380
to raise awareness.

375
00:14:35,270 --> 00:14:36,620
Come in and talk.

376
00:14:37,030 --> 00:14:38,270
The room is filled with men.

377
00:14:38,270 --> 00:14:39,030
I'm not going in.

378
00:14:39,030 --> 00:14:40,500
I have to go back and pack.

00:15:08,390 --> 00:15:10,980
is a restaurant that has been around for decades.

385
00:15:10,980 --> 00:15:12,180
It has a long history.

386
00:15:12,270 --> 00:15:14,150
It opened in the first year of Tongzhi Era.

387
00:15:14,150 --> 00:15:15,030
Well...

388
00:15:15,740 --> 00:15:17,070
All the dishes are here.

389
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:18,390
Put it here.

390
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:21,100
Come on, try it.

391
00:15:21,620 --> 00:15:22,420
Young Master.

392
00:15:22,980 --> 00:15:24,220
Black carp stomach.

393
00:15:25,190 --> 00:15:26,450
Stir fried black carp,

394
00:15:26,980 --> 00:15:29,620
These are Laozhengxing's famous dishes.

395
00:15:29,980 --> 00:15:32,270
It gives you chi, and is good for your stomach. It gets rid of troubles,

396
00:15:32,270 --> 00:15:35,030
moisture in your stomach and cures athlete's foot.

397
00:15:35,030 --> 00:15:35,740
Is that so?

398
00:15:36,390 --> 00:15:38,590
Shanghai people really know how to eat.

399
00:15:39,500 --> 00:15:41,620
Go. Get your boss.

400
00:15:41,620 --> 00:15:43,390
Get him to tell them about the dishes.

401
00:15:43,390 --> 00:15:45,650
These dishes are difficult, I don't know how to explain them.

402
00:15:45,650 --> 00:15:46,610
No need

403
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:48,060
Laixi, don't get them.

404
00:15:49,030 --> 00:15:49,620
Got it.

405
00:15:50,030 --> 00:15:51,860
I'll listen to you. We'll eat it ourselves.

406
00:15:51,860 --> 00:15:52,620
Let's eat.

407
00:15:52,980 --> 00:15:53,780
You may leave.

408
00:15:55,860 --> 00:15:58,980
Young Master, this fish dish is called the Five Mackerel Stew.

409
00:15:58,980 --> 00:16:00,840
The names given by ancient people

410
00:16:01,150 --> 00:16:03,150
are very particular.

411
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:04,710
Laozhengxing

412
00:16:04,740 --> 00:16:05,980
has a signature dish

413
00:16:06,030 --> 00:16:07,980
for each season.

414
00:16:09,150 --> 00:16:11,740
When spring comes, it's time for cockles.

415
00:16:11,980 --> 00:16:14,980
In the heaty summer, have fish in red wine sauce.

416
00:16:15,150 --> 00:16:17,860
The autumn breeze holds the drunken crab.

417
00:16:18,150 --> 00:16:20,500
And in the winter clouds, have the...

418
00:16:20,860 --> 00:16:22,620
R-red wine chicken.

419
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:26,440
Laixi.

420
00:16:26,860 --> 00:16:28,620
Young Master, this is...

421
00:16:28,710 --> 00:16:30,980
You are so knowledgeable now.

422
00:16:32,270 --> 00:16:32,980
Well...

423
00:16:33,030 --> 00:16:34,370
If my grandpa is alive,

424
00:16:34,390 --> 00:16:35,620
he would praise you.

425
00:16:36,150 --> 00:16:37,620
Did I

426
00:16:37,620 --> 00:16:38,390
upset you?

427
00:16:38,500 --> 00:16:39,620
No, I'm not upset.

428
00:16:40,220 --> 00:16:41,620
What's the saying again?

429
00:16:41,980 --> 00:16:42,620
Oh right.

430
00:16:42,860 --> 00:16:44,200
You are now

431
00:16:44,330 --> 00:16:45,930
just a wooden pecker.

432
00:16:45,950 --> 00:16:48,810
Your glib tongue helps you with everything, right?

433
00:16:49,650 --> 00:16:52,280
Well, I...

434
00:16:52,390 --> 00:16:53,100
Tufang.

435
00:16:53,500 --> 00:16:54,100
Don't be so serious

436
00:16:54,100 --> 00:16:55,270
on the dinner table.

437
00:16:55,390 --> 00:16:56,430
He's happy to see you.

438
00:16:56,430 --> 00:16:57,540
Right, Captain Laixi?

439
00:16:57,540 --> 00:16:58,540
Yes.

440
00:16:58,980 --> 00:16:59,950
Young Master, here.

441
00:16:59,950 --> 00:17:01,280
Let me fill it up for you.

442
00:17:02,790 --> 00:17:03,790
Fill it up.

443
00:17:09,060 --> 00:17:10,220
My goodness.

444
00:17:11,740 --> 00:17:13,500
I need to be grateful.

445
00:17:13,770 --> 00:17:14,829
Your great-grandfather

446
00:17:14,829 --> 00:17:15,829
saved

447
00:17:15,829 --> 00:17:17,740
my life.

448
00:17:17,770 --> 00:17:18,690
I can't

449
00:17:18,950 --> 00:17:19,980
forget my roots.

450
00:17:20,010 --> 00:17:20,900
Enough.

451
00:17:22,060 --> 00:17:23,460
I-I can't.

452
00:17:29,260 --> 00:17:30,140
Young Master,

453
00:17:30,980 --> 00:17:33,780
do you want to see His Highness?

454
00:17:34,060 --> 00:17:36,190
If you want to, I'll arrange it.

455
00:17:36,260 --> 00:17:37,220
Why should I meet him?

456
00:17:37,220 --> 00:17:38,220
I don't even know him.

457
00:17:38,220 --> 00:17:39,540
So you have to know him.

458
00:17:40,170 --> 00:17:41,410
You come from the

459
00:17:41,430 --> 00:17:42,780
same bloodline.

460
00:17:42,810 --> 00:17:45,680
You'll know each other when you meet.

461
00:17:45,700 --> 00:17:46,300
Laixi,

462
00:17:46,300 --> 00:17:48,260
why do you have a part in everything?

463
00:17:48,260 --> 00:17:49,980
My Young Master.

464
00:17:50,010 --> 00:17:51,690
This is no trivial thing.

465
00:17:51,950 --> 00:17:54,460
Now that you are a military student,

466
00:17:54,500 --> 00:17:56,540
you're an official.

467
00:17:56,700 --> 00:17:58,100
Once you're an official,

468
00:17:58,220 --> 00:18:00,900
you need to have connections both inside and outside.

469
00:18:00,900 --> 00:18:02,950
All the more you need money to socialize

470
00:18:02,950 --> 00:18:04,750
and communicate.

471
00:18:04,950 --> 00:18:05,950
Otherwise,

472
00:18:05,980 --> 00:18:08,190
no matter how hard you work this life,

473
00:18:08,300 --> 00:18:10,060
you will only be a low-ranking soldier.

474
00:18:10,060 --> 00:18:11,020
Trust me.

475
00:18:11,220 --> 00:18:11,950
That's right.

476
00:18:11,950 --> 00:18:12,460
Right?

477
00:18:12,460 --> 00:18:13,430
Yes.

478
00:18:13,460 --> 00:18:14,260
Besides,

479
00:18:14,300 --> 00:18:16,300
you're a descendant of Baturu.

480
00:18:16,430 --> 00:18:17,770
You can't just be

481
00:18:17,790 --> 00:18:20,000
a m-mediocre man forever.

482
00:18:23,700 --> 00:18:24,740
Then...

483
00:18:25,590 --> 00:18:26,830
how do we meet?

484
00:18:30,020 --> 00:18:32,460
His Highness asked my guards

485
00:18:32,490 --> 00:18:34,500
for horses and riders to protect him.

486
00:18:34,500 --> 00:18:37,460
I'm going to the Chamber of Foreign Affairs tomorrow morning

487
00:18:37,460 --> 00:18:39,300
to ride horses with His Highness.

488
00:18:39,300 --> 00:18:41,740
Why don't you come with me

489
00:18:42,060 --> 00:18:43,430
and get to know His Highness.

490
00:18:43,430 --> 00:18:44,290
Riding horses?

491
00:18:44,700 --> 00:18:45,700
I'm good at that.

492
00:18:47,590 --> 00:18:49,300
Can I bring Renjun and Kaizhi

493
00:18:49,300 --> 00:18:50,260
along?

494
00:18:53,260 --> 00:18:55,700
I'm afraid not.

495
00:18:56,060 --> 00:18:57,370
Many people want to meet

496
00:18:57,370 --> 00:18:59,530
His Highness since he's in Shanghai.

497
00:18:59,740 --> 00:19:02,950
His Highness is only assigning his personal guards to meet these people

498
00:19:02,950 --> 00:19:05,300
and is only meeting two people personally.

499
00:19:05,300 --> 00:19:08,590
One of them is the Viceroy of Liangjiang, Liu Kunyi.

500
00:19:08,700 --> 00:19:09,460
And the other

501
00:19:09,490 --> 00:19:12,820
is the Governor of Hubei who is passing by while on a missing,

502
00:19:13,190 --> 00:19:13,950
Duan Fang.

503
00:19:44,300 --> 00:19:45,430
So beautiful.

504
00:19:48,870 --> 00:19:50,190
Which family are you from?

505
00:19:50,190 --> 00:19:50,850
Yang Yifan.

506
00:19:50,950 --> 00:19:52,200
He's from Wanjiang.

507
00:19:54,830 --> 00:19:56,430
This child is eating so fast.

508
00:19:57,460 --> 00:19:59,220
Yeah, they use a lot of strength.

509
00:19:59,220 --> 00:20:00,460
Otherwise, why would there be the saying

510
00:20:00,460 --> 00:20:02,660
"using the strength of drinking milk."

511
00:20:03,810 --> 00:20:04,870
My husband

512
00:20:04,890 --> 00:20:06,190
is doing everything he can

513
00:20:06,190 --> 00:20:07,220
to set up this school

514
00:20:07,220 --> 00:20:08,060
for ladies.

515
00:20:08,300 --> 00:20:10,220
What's the use? No one is attending it.

516
00:20:10,220 --> 00:20:10,590
Otherwise,

517
00:20:10,590 --> 00:20:12,670
why would we be called here to fill up the classrooms?

518
00:20:12,670 --> 00:20:13,880
Who is your husband?

519
00:20:14,780 --> 00:20:17,220
His surname is Xu. He's in charge of General Affairs.

520
00:20:17,220 --> 00:20:18,220
What's your name?

521
00:20:18,260 --> 00:20:19,830
Me? I'm Ahyi.

522
00:20:20,740 --> 00:20:21,950
Is this your full name?

523
00:20:21,950 --> 00:20:22,700
Yes.

524
00:20:22,980 --> 00:20:24,840
It doesn't sound like a full name.

525
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:27,170
It's just a random name.

526
00:20:27,260 --> 00:20:28,980
My father wants boys.

527
00:20:29,020 --> 00:20:31,220
But he had four daughters in one go.

528
00:20:31,590 --> 00:20:32,540
My father got so angry

529
00:20:32,540 --> 00:20:34,460
he refused to give names properly.

530
00:20:34,460 --> 00:20:36,720
So we are just called jia, yi, bing, ding.

531
00:20:37,300 --> 00:20:39,190
I'm second in line, so I'm called Ahyi.

532
00:20:39,190 --> 00:20:40,500
Just call me Ahyi.

533
00:20:41,780 --> 00:20:42,740
Why isn't the teacher

534
00:20:42,740 --> 00:20:44,240
here yet?

535
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:50,480
Come on, Hanhua.

536
00:20:59,490 --> 00:21:00,620
The teacher is here.

537
00:21:04,460 --> 00:21:06,060
The first rule of our class:

538
00:21:07,060 --> 00:21:08,370
before the class begins,

539
00:21:08,370 --> 00:21:11,030
teachers and students should bow to each other.

540
00:21:11,300 --> 00:21:12,300
Today is special.

541
00:21:12,850 --> 00:21:14,500
You may skip the formalities.

542
00:21:14,500 --> 00:21:15,700
Let me bow to you.

543
00:21:16,090 --> 00:21:17,110
Thank you

544
00:21:17,910 --> 00:21:19,130
for supporting us.

545
00:21:22,540 --> 00:21:24,070
I'll teach the first lesson

546
00:21:24,540 --> 00:21:25,740
of the girls' school.

547
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:27,610
What should I teach?

548
00:21:28,390 --> 00:21:29,450
I thought about it.

549
00:21:30,190 --> 00:21:32,740
You are all ladies of various families.

550
00:21:32,830 --> 00:21:34,290
Let's not be too serious.

551
00:21:35,020 --> 00:21:37,190
I'll give you a geography class.

552
00:21:37,700 --> 00:21:38,780
Geography?

553
00:21:47,460 --> 00:21:49,300
You're all here to study.

554
00:21:50,430 --> 00:21:51,540
In fact,

555
00:21:51,540 --> 00:21:52,780
the earliest writing

556
00:21:53,460 --> 00:21:55,830
is not in the form of a book, but pictures.

557
00:21:56,190 --> 00:21:57,460
Let's imagine now.

558
00:21:58,220 --> 00:22:00,590
It is a million years ago now.

559
00:22:01,020 --> 00:22:02,700
On a clear dusk.

560
00:22:03,980 --> 00:22:04,780
The location

561
00:22:05,220 --> 00:22:07,460
is where you are right now.

562
00:22:08,780 --> 00:22:10,590
One million years ago,

563
00:22:11,260 --> 00:22:13,220
this place was still a swamp.

564
00:22:13,980 --> 00:22:15,460
Our ancestors

565
00:22:15,780 --> 00:22:17,220
drew several lines

566
00:22:18,220 --> 00:22:19,950
on this

567
00:22:20,020 --> 00:22:21,300
muddy land.

568
00:22:21,980 --> 00:22:24,300
It represents coastline,

569
00:22:25,540 --> 00:22:27,220
mountains and rivers.

570
00:22:27,590 --> 00:22:29,500
Then they said to this map

571
00:22:30,220 --> 00:22:31,060
Dude,

572
00:22:33,220 --> 00:22:34,460
we're here now.

573
00:22:35,540 --> 00:22:36,700
I hope we can

574
00:22:36,950 --> 00:22:38,590
get here by tomorrow.

575
00:22:39,130 --> 00:22:41,650
Look, what is this?

576
00:22:42,820 --> 00:22:43,480

So you are Liang Xiang.

592

It's time for us imperial clan

598
00:25:03,020 --> 00:25:04,880

But at our generation,

604
00:25:24,430 --> 00:25:25,430
we are anothing.

to study military,

610
00:26:01,540 --> 00:26:03,270
it'd be good enough if you could

611
00:26:03,740 --> 00:26:04,950
figure out one thing.

612
00:26:08,380 --> 00:26:09,250
What is it?

613
00:26:10,300 --> 00:26:11,590
Please tell me.

614
00:26:14,950 --> 00:26:16,410
Why can the Japanese do it,

615
00:26:17,630 --> 00:26:18,710
but not us?

616
00:26:21,390 --> 00:26:23,480
Why can Japanese army do it,

617
00:26:24,950 --> 00:26:26,450
but not our army?

618
00:26:29,320 --> 00:26:31,780

We are both east asians.

622
00:26:41,830 --> 00:26:43,260
How did they do that?

623
00:26:50,500 --> 00:26:52,100
There's a way to everything.

624
00:26:54,830 --> 00:26:56,460
Go find it for me.

625
00:27:05,700 --> 00:27:07,190
This is today's map.

626

It was drawn 50 years ago.

627
00:27:11,220 --> 00:27:12,950
But it's not accurate anymore.

628
00:27:13,460 --> 00:27:15,190
What do you think the reason for that is?

629
00:27:15,190 --> 00:27:16,020
Because here,

630
00:27:16,020 --> 00:27:17,500
here, and here,

631
00:27:17,670 --> 00:27:19,460
have been divided away.

632
00:27:20,740 --> 00:27:21,910
In half a century,

633
00:27:22,430 --> 00:27:23,130

634
00:27:23,150 --> 00:27:24,200
over 1.5 million

635
00:27:24,230 --> 00:27:26,100
square kilometers of land.

636
00:27:26,590 --> 00:27:28,200
It's equivalent to three Frances,

637
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:29,240
four Germanies,

638
00:27:29,260 --> 00:27:31,020
and six United Kingdoms.

639
00:27:31,430 --> 00:27:32,500
And now,

641
00:27:35,150 --> 00:27:37,340
are still occupying our capital.

642
00:27:47,820 --> 00:27:49,320
I've always loved maps.

643
00:27:50,190 --> 00:27:52,810
I love it for its beauty and practicality.

644
00:27:53,680 --> 00:27:55,080

645
00:27:56,460 --> 00:27:57,300
With the map,

646
00:27:57,980 --> 00:27:58,700
we can know

647
00:27:58,700 --> 00:28:00,040
where we are.

00:28:00,590 --> 00:28:03,650

So geography

652
00:28:15,260 --> 00:28:15,950

00:28:15,950 --> 00:28:17,440
the fate of a nation.

654
00:28:18,790 --> 00:28:20,720

655
00:28:21,780 --> 00:28:22,950

Even if we recruited students,

676
00:29:18,550 --> 00:29:19,820
they'd be scared away by you.

677
00:29:19,820 --> 00:29:21,700
It's inevitable. It's an experiment.

must students must learn these things from you?

683
00:29:32,980 --> 00:29:34,150
This is very useful.

684
00:29:34,190 --> 00:29:35,190
How useful?

685
00:29:35,260 --> 00:29:36,260
Let me put it this way.

686
00:29:36,260 --> 00:29:37,220
This world

687
00:29:37,780 --> 00:29:38,980
is full of chemistry.

688
00:29:39,190 --> 00:29:40,790
You can say it is everywhere.

689
00:29:41,260 --> 00:29:42,780
Do you know what water is?

690
00:29:43,430 --> 00:29:44,430

This is water?

693
00:29:53,370 --> 00:29:55,540
This is the chemical symbol of water.

694
00:29:56,150 --> 00:29:57,700
Why do you need to put it as symbols?

695
00:29:57,700 --> 00:29:59,820
People need to know the essence of the world.

696
00:29:59,820 --> 00:30:01,480
You need to know what water is.

697
00:30:01,500 --> 00:30:02,190
Well...

698
00:30:02,320 --> 00:30:04,150
Fishes live in water all their lives.

699
00:30:04,150 --> 00:30:06,300

700

But you're not a fish.

701

This is water.

703
00:30:14,740 --> 00:30:16,540
When I put this into the water...

704
00:30:18,910 --> 00:30:19,700
When the two substances

705
00:30:19,700 --> 00:30:20,980
are fully fused,

706
00:30:21,020 --> 00:30:21,670
it will create

707
00:30:21,670 --> 00:30:22,950
different chemistry reactions.

708
00:30:22,950 --> 00:30:23,950
It has actually become

709
00:30:23,950 --> 00:30:24,670
a new substance.

710
00:30:24,670 --> 00:30:26,020
Will it explode again?

711
00:30:26,520 --> 00:30:27,590
Do you want to see explosions?

712
00:30:27,590 --> 00:30:28,350
N-No.

713
00:30:28,370 --> 00:30:29,130
It's okay.

714
00:30:31,020 --> 00:30:32,170
You'll see

715
00:30:32,190 --> 00:30:33,260
the most romantic chemistry reaction

716
00:30:33,260 --> 00:30:35,500
in the world.

717
00:30:38,020 --> 00:30:40,700
When these two substances meet each other,

718
00:30:40,780 --> 00:30:42,190
they will instantly

719
00:30:42,190 --> 00:30:43,400
create immense energy.

720
00:30:43,400 --> 00:30:45,400
No, no, no. Please don't.

721
00:30:46,430 --> 00:30:47,890
I don't want to be like you.

722
00:30:48,520 --> 00:30:50,110
Fine, I'll do a

723
00:30:50,140 --> 00:30:51,800
safer demonstration for you.

724
00:31:02,460 --> 00:31:04,060
Let me draw a picture for you.

725
00:31:04,950 --> 00:31:05,780
A picture?

726
00:31:06,540 --> 00:31:07,160
Yes.

727
00:31:24,020 --> 00:31:25,080
This is also water?

728
00:31:25,160 --> 00:31:26,270
This is not water.

729
00:31:26,670 --> 00:31:28,400
But they look exactly the same.

730
00:31:28,460 --> 00:31:29,720
They are so different.

731
00:31:41,160 --> 00:31:43,310
Did anyone draw a portrait for you before?

732
00:31:43,310 --> 00:31:45,070
Yes. My father did.

733
00:31:45,380 --> 00:31:47,040
My family sells ink and paper.

734
00:31:47,150 --> 00:31:48,350
Didn't he praise you?

735
00:31:48,740 --> 00:31:49,700
What for?

736
00:31:55,670 --> 00:31:58,060
Don't move. Look at me.

737
00:32:15,050 --> 00:32:16,630
Can you paint with that?

738
00:32:17,130 --> 00:32:18,640
You'll know later.

739
00:32:22,020 --> 00:32:22,820
Done.

740
00:32:27,700 --> 00:32:28,870
What kind of painting is this?

741
00:32:28,870 --> 00:32:29,870
Don't be anxious.

742
00:32:58,700 --> 00:33:00,300
This is my impression of you.

743
00:33:00,980 --> 00:33:03,630
A lotus flower on a mud ground,

744
00:33:03,950 --> 00:33:05,950
blooming beautifully and cleanly.

745
00:33:06,390 --> 00:33:08,590
What is this ink?

746
00:33:08,670 --> 00:33:09,630
It's not ink.

747
00:33:09,630 --> 00:33:11,390
It's a chemical substance.

748
00:33:11,420 --> 00:33:13,420
It's a secret letter ink I invented.

749
00:33:13,470 --> 00:33:16,470
It's used to deliver the revolutionary information.

750
00:33:17,290 --> 00:33:18,090
It's for you.

751
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:22,660
Why do you bind your chest?

752
00:33:26,150 --> 00:33:27,080
This is not good.

753
00:33:27,300 --> 00:33:28,960
You'll get sick in the future.

754
00:33:32,080 --> 00:33:33,280

756
00:33:34,260 --> 00:33:35,990
and live an unrestrained life.

757
00:33:37,190 --> 00:33:39,870
If Chinese people want China to be a strong country and race,

758
00:33:39,870 --> 00:33:42,530
we need a healthy mother.

759
00:33:48,060 --> 00:33:51,590
There are still a few days to the embarkment of the ship to Japan.

760
00:33:51,830 --> 00:33:53,170
But it doesn't mean

761
00:33:53,190 --> 00:33:55,260
You can

762
00:33:55,350 --> 00:33:57,180

763
00:33:58,180 --> 00:34:00,610
I've invited a Japanese teacher

764
00:34:02,020 --> 00:34:03,540
for you.

765
00:34:03,700 --> 00:34:04,350
Here.

766
00:34:10,980 --> 00:34:12,020
So,

767
00:34:12,270 --> 00:34:14,020
you need to know basic conversational

768
00:34:14,020 --> 00:34:15,060
Japanese.

769
00:34:15,590 --> 00:34:17,320
Otherwise, when you get there,

770
00:34:18,139 --> 00:34:20,540
you can't even find a toilet.

771
00:34:21,020 --> 00:34:22,300
If you had to pee,

772
00:34:22,350 --> 00:34:23,020
you can't just pee

773
00:34:23,020 --> 00:34:24,179
on the street?

774
00:34:26,460 --> 00:34:28,060
Alright, I'll stop here.

775
00:34:28,179 --> 00:34:30,210
Now let's welcome our Japanese teacher

776
00:34:30,210 --> 00:34:32,000
to start the class.

777
00:34:33,480 --> 00:34:34,610
Are you Liang Xiang?

778
00:34:37,469 --> 00:34:38,159
Yes.

779
00:34:38,400 --> 00:34:40,210
Don't be in a hurry to go to class.

780
00:34:40,750 --> 00:34:42,790
There's something I need to talk to you about in private.

781
00:34:42,790 --> 00:34:43,630
Come with me.

782
00:34:48,550 --> 00:34:50,750
I'm Meng Fuxhao from Shanghai Circuit.

783
00:34:53,659 --> 00:34:54,540
Mr. Meng.

784
00:34:55,659 --> 00:34:56,659
Here's the thing.

785
00:34:57,139 --> 00:34:58,540
You military students

786
00:34:58,540 --> 00:35:00,000
are going to study abroad.

787
00:35:00,540 --> 00:35:02,710
The court puts much importance on it.

788
00:35:03,540 --> 00:35:05,230
They picked you out of millions.

789
00:35:05,230 --> 00:35:06,130
You are

790
00:35:06,230 --> 00:35:08,020
the pillars of our country.

791
00:35:08,140 --> 00:35:09,020
Someone from

792
00:35:09,020 --> 00:35:10,660
an imperial like you

793
00:35:10,790 --> 00:35:11,790
is also

794
00:35:11,830 --> 00:35:14,750
greatly loved.

795
00:35:14,870 --> 00:35:18,270
So, I have no reason

796
00:35:21,350 --> 00:35:22,710
to not trust you.

797
00:35:25,310 --> 00:35:26,100
This is...

798
00:35:26,270 --> 00:35:27,850
This is the first informant fee

799
00:35:27,850 --> 00:35:30,500
from Shanghai Circuit.

800
00:35:30,790 --> 00:35:31,980
Informant fee?

801
00:35:33,460 --> 00:35:34,350
Why?

802
00:35:34,790 --> 00:35:35,580
Tokyo

803
00:35:35,620 --> 00:35:37,620
is the base of the rebels.

804
00:35:38,230 --> 00:35:39,360
When you go to Tokyo,

805
00:35:39,670 --> 00:35:40,840
you will inevitably

806
00:35:41,180 --> 00:35:42,600
meet them.

807
00:35:44,310 --> 00:35:45,010
Really?

808
00:35:47,060 --> 00:35:48,720
You don't have to do anything.

809
00:35:48,790 --> 00:35:50,770
Just report to me

810
00:35:51,060 --> 00:35:52,060
their movements

811
00:35:52,060 --> 00:35:53,540
every two months.

812
00:35:54,890 --> 00:35:58,120
It's nothing difficult. What do you think?

813
00:36:18,370 --> 00:36:19,270
Brother-in-law.

814
00:36:19,270 --> 00:36:20,870
What were you talking about?

815
00:36:20,870 --> 00:36:21,870
You look so happy.

816
00:36:22,320 --> 00:36:23,850
Mr. Wu is very interesting.

817
00:36:24,060 --> 00:36:24,950
Really?

818
00:36:30,430 --> 00:36:31,580
I'm telling you.

819
00:36:32,420 --> 00:36:34,140
You'd better stay away from him.

820
00:36:34,140 --> 00:36:35,430
What do you mean?

821
00:36:36,500 --> 00:36:37,660
You're a girl from a

822
00:36:37,660 --> 00:36:38,660
small place.

823
00:36:38,750 --> 00:36:40,020
Yet you're being so flamboyant.

824
00:36:40,020 --> 00:36:41,140
What are you thinking?

825
00:36:41,140 --> 00:36:42,740
I know him better than you do.

826
00:36:46,180 --> 00:36:47,060
What is this?

827
00:36:47,460 --> 00:36:48,270
It's nothing.

828
00:36:58,350 --> 00:36:59,180
School is a place

829
00:36:59,180 --> 00:37:00,910
to spread ideas and knowledge.

830
00:37:01,480 --> 00:37:03,040
Mr. Cheng from Anqing

831
00:37:03,060 --> 00:37:04,060
will tell you

832
00:37:04,090 --> 00:37:05,850
what's equality between men and women

833
00:37:05,850 --> 00:37:07,140
and freedom of marriage.

834
00:37:07,140 --> 00:37:08,080
You need to

835
00:37:08,730 --> 00:37:10,430
listen to this lesson properly.

836
00:37:10,430 --> 00:37:11,600
Which Mr. Cheng?

837
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:12,690
Cheng Zhaofang.

838
00:37:35,380 --> 00:37:37,050
Sit up. Sit up, all right?

839
00:37:42,500 --> 00:37:43,580
What is Aunt doing?

840
00:37:44,500 --> 00:37:45,870
She's getting changed.

841

Shuhong.

842
00:37:54,660 --> 00:37:55,500
In this,

843
00:37:55,910 --> 00:37:59,370
you're even better than the foreign ladies at the concession.

844
00:37:59,940 --> 00:38:00,830
Is it okay?

845
00:38:00,950 --> 00:38:01,950
Why not?

846
00:38:02,060 --> 00:38:04,020
It's what your parents gave you.

847
00:38:04,100 --> 00:38:05,230
You didn't steal it.

848
00:38:05,540 --> 00:38:07,020
I bound my chest for five years.

849
00:38:07,020 --> 00:38:09,550
It's only after I'm breast-feeding that I find out that it's bad for you.

850
00:38:09,550 --> 00:38:11,230
The baby can only be half full.

851
00:38:11,660 --> 00:38:13,980
Is it okay to wear this to class?

852
00:38:14,260 --> 00:38:16,230
Don't worry. It's just a dress.

853
00:38:23,660 --> 00:38:25,460
The reason for human's marriage

854
00:38:25,540 --> 00:38:28,390
is because men and women love each other and can't bear to be separated.

855
00:38:28,390 --> 00:38:30,180
So men and women marry.

856
00:38:31,850 --> 00:38:33,050
But China's marriage

857
00:38:33,660 --> 00:38:37,580
is not decided by men and women themselves

858
00:38:38,020 --> 00:38:39,870
but others around them

859
00:38:40,460 --> 00:38:42,140
forcing them to get married.

860
00:38:42,660 --> 00:38:44,390
It's loathsome that us Chinese

861
00:38:44,460 --> 00:38:46,180
have this decided for by our fathers and brothes.

[Shanghai Girls' School Member
Cheng Zhaifang]

863
00:38:46,600 --> 00:38:48,270
Are there any couples

864
00:38:48,300 --> 00:38:49,870
who married willingly?

865
00:38:50,870 --> 00:38:52,960
When hiring a clerk for a store,

866
00:38:52,980 --> 00:38:54,980
you can only rest assured

867
00:38:54,980 --> 00:38:56,640
when you both like each other.

868
00:38:57,030 --> 00:38:57,760
Becoming husband and wife

869
00:38:57,760 --> 00:39:00,200
means you spend decades together.

870
00:39:00,470 --> 00:39:02,430
I'd like to ask, is it really appropriate

871
00:39:02,430 --> 00:39:03,910
to force two people who

872
00:39:03,910 --> 00:39:05,060
don't love each other

873
00:39:05,060 --> 00:39:06,240
to get married?

874
00:39:08,070 --> 00:39:10,700
There is this saying that goes, "Talented women always end up living with dumb men as husbands."

875
00:39:10,700 --> 00:39:11,660
Why?

876
00:39:12,540 --> 00:39:14,580
It's just for the man's fortune

877
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:17,950
or on the relationship and connection the family has.

878
00:39:17,950 --> 00:39:19,870
The child is barely half a metre tall

879
00:39:19,870 --> 00:39:22,540
and the family is already anxious about their marriage.

880
00:39:22,540 --> 00:39:23,320
You have no idea

881
00:39:23,320 --> 00:39:26,070
if they'd be blind of lame in the future.

882
00:39:28,350 --> 00:39:29,680
The marriage of Chinese

883
00:39:30,060 --> 00:39:32,540
fails because of this word...

884
00:39:45,950 --> 00:39:47,660
It's unreasonable.

885
00:39:49,060 --> 00:39:51,230
For a grown woman to be married to a man who's barely a year old.

886
00:39:51,230 --> 00:39:52,360
Is that reasonable?

887
00:39:55,500 --> 00:39:56,540
Don't laugh.

888
00:39:57,390 --> 00:39:59,500
This concerns the strength of our country.

889
00:39:59,500 --> 00:40:00,660
It's a big deal.

Can I copy your lecture notes?

893
00:40:25,280 --> 00:40:27,020
I'm sorry. My lectures are impromptu.

I don't have a script.

895
00:40:29,230 --> 00:40:30,620
Your lesson was amazing, Sir.

896
00:40:30,620 --> 00:40:32,670
It's as simple as you said.

No need to copy the lecture notes.

talk about?
