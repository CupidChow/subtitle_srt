[Episode 35]

3
00:01:46,620 --> 00:01:54,270
[Autumn of the third year of Xuantong
reign, 1911 AD]

4
00:02:35,970 --> 00:02:37,140
Attention!

5
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:39,450
Salute!

6
00:03:03,940 --> 00:03:05,760
The imperial edict has been issued.

7
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:07,160
The main force of the Beiyang Army

8
00:03:07,160 --> 00:03:09,820
will be fully deployed and march
towards Yongping.

9
00:03:09,820 --> 00:03:12,750
A large-scale military exercise
will be conducted.

10
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:32,920
Tufang earnestly hopes

11
00:03:34,810 --> 00:03:38,040
that all of you present can understand
the court's

12
00:03:38,210 --> 00:03:40,079
special military action undertaken
by the court

13
00:03:40,079 --> 00:03:42,850
under these exceptional circumstances.

14
00:03:46,390 --> 00:03:47,670
This is not merely

15
00:03:47,690 --> 00:03:48,950
a military operation,

16
00:03:49,900 --> 00:03:53,290
but also a political arrangement.

17
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:12,660
I don't have any good tea here.
You'll have to make do with this.

18
00:04:13,830 --> 00:04:15,800
You're still living so frugally.

19
00:04:16,070 --> 00:04:16,600
Haven't you ever thought about

20
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:18,060
finding yourself a woman?

21
00:04:18,850 --> 00:04:21,510
As luck would have it, she's
arriving tomorrow.

22
00:04:23,570 --> 00:04:24,680
Is that so?

23
00:04:25,060 --> 00:04:25,990
Where did you get her?

24
00:04:25,990 --> 00:04:28,320
How come you never mentioned this before?

25
00:04:30,010 --> 00:04:31,010
It's fate.

26
00:04:31,870 --> 00:04:33,800
I didn't expect it myself, either.

27
00:04:34,630 --> 00:04:35,490
That I believe.

28
00:04:35,930 --> 00:04:36,780
When it comes to romances between
men and women,

29
00:04:36,780 --> 00:04:38,440
most of them are predestined.

30
00:04:40,050 --> 00:04:41,050
I'd like to see

31
00:04:41,390 --> 00:04:42,930
what kind of woman a man

32
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:43,909
with such refined taste like you

33
00:04:43,909 --> 00:04:44,740
has chosen.

34
00:04:45,610 --> 00:04:47,030
Treat me to a meal tomorrow.

35
00:04:47,030 --> 00:04:48,190
I'd like to meet her.

36
00:04:49,810 --> 00:04:50,900
Sure. Certainly.

37
00:04:54,450 --> 00:04:56,430
For this autumn military drill
in Yongping,

38
00:04:56,430 --> 00:04:57,960
after much consideration,

39
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:00,000
I finally decided

40
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,050
to have your Sixth Division

41
00:05:01,050 --> 00:05:02,380
march together with us.

42
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:05,410
Right. All my good friends are here.

43
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:08,490
You, Renjun, Maichen

44
00:05:09,150 --> 00:05:10,550
are all my close friends.

45
00:05:12,190 --> 00:05:14,010
I'm very pleased that you, as the Viceroy,

46
00:05:14,010 --> 00:05:15,580
can still be so sentimental

47
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:18,410
about old friendships.

48
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:24,750
I've never quite figured out

49
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:27,080
who nominated Li Renjun

50
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:28,960
to the Twelfth Brigade.

51
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:34,440
Well, he's already here,

52
00:05:34,750 --> 00:05:36,430
so what difference does it make

53
00:05:36,430 --> 00:05:37,690
whether we know or not?

54
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:42,540
What's with that tone?

55
00:05:43,870 --> 00:05:45,670
What kind of tone did you expect?

56
00:05:47,640 --> 00:05:49,080
It's good that he's here.

57
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:51,280
In less than half a year,

58
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:53,080
he's already got the Twelfth Brigade

59
00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:54,610
wrapped around his finger.

60
00:05:55,190 --> 00:05:57,080
He's all chummy with everyone,

61
00:05:58,190 --> 00:05:59,650
always working his charm.

62
00:06:04,520 --> 00:06:05,750
I see what you mean.

63
00:06:06,750 --> 00:06:07,400
Right.

64
00:06:08,190 --> 00:06:10,640
There's no way you could
pull off that act.

65
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:14,720
It's not that I can't,

66
00:06:17,750 --> 00:06:19,480
but I won't stoop to that level.

67
00:06:22,850 --> 00:06:24,930
Can you mobilize him?

68
00:06:28,750 --> 00:06:30,410
It's still the same as always.

69
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:34,280
You can never tell

70
00:06:34,930 --> 00:06:37,970
which of his words are true and
which are lies.

71
00:06:40,310 --> 00:06:41,840
This won't do, Kaizhi.

72
00:06:42,520 --> 00:06:44,030
If you can't even handle
an old classmate and friend,

73
00:06:44,030 --> 00:06:46,090
let alone that Brigade Commander Wu.

74
00:06:47,790 --> 00:06:50,990
Tufang, to be honest with you,

75
00:06:52,750 --> 00:06:55,210
if it weren't for the autumn
military drill,

76
00:06:55,430 --> 00:06:56,190
I might have already

77
00:06:56,190 --> 00:06:58,250
asked for leave to go back to Beijing.

78
00:07:03,310 --> 00:07:06,050
You really surprise me, Kaizhi.

79
00:07:06,220 --> 00:07:07,340
What can I do?

80
00:07:08,590 --> 00:07:09,850
After all these years,

81
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:12,000
what we've been striving for

82
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:14,820
and what we've actually achieved

83
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:18,010
are completely different.

84
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:24,450
You can't leave.

85
00:07:25,010 --> 00:07:26,160
If you leave,

86
00:07:26,230 --> 00:07:27,520
the Sixth Division will be completely

87
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:29,520
under Yuan's control, inside and out.

88
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:31,250
As for the current situation of
the Sixth Division,

89
00:07:31,250 --> 00:07:32,290
Lord Zaitao and I

90
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:34,180
are actually very clear about it.

91
00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:38,740
What's the use of being clear?

92
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:42,100
When we needed you at the crucial moment,

93
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:44,500
you went abroad.

94
00:07:45,020 --> 00:07:45,780
Tufang.

95
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:48,350
Don't hide in the room, you two,

96
00:07:48,350 --> 00:07:49,280
whispering to each other.

97
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:50,870
The drinks are already served over there.

98
00:07:50,870 --> 00:07:52,640
Everyone's waiting for you two.

99
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:54,280
Alright, alright, let's go eat.

100
00:07:54,280 --> 00:07:55,680
-Let's go.
-Let's go eat.

101
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:57,400
No need for formalities.

102
00:07:57,400 --> 00:07:58,350
We still have seven or eight more days

103
00:07:58,350 --> 00:07:59,409
to spend together.

104

[Zhentou Train Station, Shijiazhuang]

105
00:08:32,210 --> 00:08:32,990
Let me.

106
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:38,500
Let's go home.

107
00:08:39,559 --> 00:08:41,909
I didn't expect you to come
pick me up yourself.

108
00:08:41,909 --> 00:08:43,039
Listen to yourself.

109
00:08:43,270 --> 00:08:44,930
Do I really seem that pompous?

110
00:08:45,420 --> 00:08:46,370
A little bit.

111
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:52,100
How about now?

112
00:09:09,390 --> 00:09:11,190
You need to be mentally prepared

113
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:13,000
to face someone.

114
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:15,250
You mean Renjun?

115
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:19,120
It's Liang Xiang.

116
00:09:20,520 --> 00:09:21,640
He's in town?

117
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:25,570
The Sixth Division will depart
in three days

118
00:09:25,570 --> 00:09:27,970
for the autumn military drill in Yongping.

119
00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:29,670
He's the overall supervisor

120
00:09:29,670 --> 00:09:31,530
of all the participating troops.

121
00:09:31,790 --> 00:09:33,000
Liang Xiang came to your city

122
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,660
to be the overall supervisor?

123
00:09:35,670 --> 00:09:37,120
What can I do about it?

124
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:39,650
The court doesn't trust me.

125
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:41,360
So...

126
00:09:43,880 --> 00:09:45,240
All the domestic newspapers

127
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:46,520
have already published the news

128
00:09:46,520 --> 00:09:48,120
about your military drill.

129
00:09:48,550 --> 00:09:49,950
That's also why I'm here.

130
00:09:53,670 --> 00:09:54,640
Take a look.

131
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:56,080
It's from Huang Xing.

132
00:09:58,640 --> 00:09:59,400
Keqiang?

133
00:09:59,880 --> 00:10:01,240
Isn't he in Guangzhou?

134
00:10:02,550 --> 00:10:04,000
After the failure of the
Guangzhou Uprising,

135
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,460
he retreated to Shanghai.

136
00:10:06,280 --> 00:10:08,940
I was hesitating whether to
come here as agreed,

137
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:11,100
and he was the one who urged me to come.

138
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:23,360
To take advantage of the autumn military
drill for an uprising?

139
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:25,290
Keqiang is indeed too optimistic.

140
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:28,620
So that's not the case?

141
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:40,200
For this autumn military drill,

142
00:10:40,280 --> 00:10:42,550
the court is taking strict precautions
with all units.

143
00:10:42,550 --> 00:10:44,550
Guns and ammunition are separated.

144
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:46,880
And the First Brigade of the
Imperial Guards

145
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:48,000
will march along

146
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:49,620
to closely supervise.

147
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:53,760
Even Liang Xiang marching with
the Sixth Division

148
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:55,400
was entirely aimed at me.

149
00:11:00,470 --> 00:11:02,520
Yet he keeps telling me

150
00:11:03,550 --> 00:11:05,280
that he's here to meet friends.

151
00:11:06,520 --> 00:11:08,180
How can he be so hypocritical?

152
00:11:10,550 --> 00:11:12,880
He's in the Prince Regent's inner circle.

153
00:11:13,550 --> 00:11:15,210
It's where his interests lie.

154
00:11:15,670 --> 00:11:17,130
He has to be hypocritical.

155
00:11:29,520 --> 00:11:31,180
Look at Commander-in-chief.

156
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:32,320
He brought you

157
00:11:32,350 --> 00:11:33,040
directly from the train station

158
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:34,120
here to my place.

159
00:11:34,520 --> 00:11:36,420
Why do you keep using the official title

160
00:11:36,420 --> 00:11:37,470
and calling him

161
00:11:37,470 --> 00:11:38,760
Commander-in-Chief?

162
00:11:39,280 --> 00:11:40,760
It's the military custom.

163
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,240
Renjun specifically instructed

164
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:43,040
me to change how I address him.

165
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:44,450
Who would want to use official titles?

166
00:11:44,450 --> 00:11:46,110
It makes things all so formal.

167
00:11:49,160 --> 00:11:50,960
Since you got here from Beijing,

168
00:11:51,170 --> 00:11:53,230
have you been to Liang Xiang's house?

169
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:54,850
Yes,

170
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:56,040
of course I have.

171
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:57,970
I go there several times a week.

172
00:11:58,520 --> 00:12:00,040
The school your son attends

173
00:12:00,040 --> 00:12:01,440
is right next to my house.

174
00:12:01,640 --> 00:12:03,170
Sometimes when Duo Mei is too busy,

175
00:12:03,170 --> 00:12:04,880
I pick up and drop off their son for her.

176
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:06,280
He's already in school now?

177
00:12:06,280 --> 00:12:07,120
Yes.

178
00:12:07,880 --> 00:12:09,120
The Old Madam of the Liang family

179
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:10,880
values this grandson so much.

180
00:12:11,180 --> 00:12:12,520
Not to mention schooling,

181
00:12:12,520 --> 00:12:15,590
at such a young age, she
insists on him learning painting.

182
00:12:15,590 --> 00:12:17,250
Do you know who the teacher is?

183
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:18,000
Who?

184
00:12:18,470 --> 00:12:19,640
Duanfang.

185
00:12:20,760 --> 00:12:21,750
Who is Duanfang?

186
00:12:22,280 --> 00:12:23,550
You don't even know him?

187
00:12:23,550 --> 00:12:25,330
He's the former Viceroy of Liangjiang

188
00:12:25,330 --> 00:12:26,190
and Viceroy of Zhili,

189
00:12:26,190 --> 00:12:27,350
Duke Duanfang.

190
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:29,760
He lost his official title a year ago.

191
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:31,130
Since he was idle anyway,

192
00:12:31,130 --> 00:12:32,880
the Old Madam pulled some strings

193
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:35,120
to have him teach her grandson painting.

194
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:37,280
He comes to teach twice a month.

195
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:38,720
Can you believe that?

196
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:42,360
Kaizhi

197
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:43,640
is quite clever,

198
00:12:43,880 --> 00:12:45,400
bringing you here.

199
00:12:46,010 --> 00:12:48,610
Liang Xiang will also come over for lunch.

200
00:12:50,120 --> 00:12:52,920
The relationships are a bit
too complicated here.

201
00:12:53,260 --> 00:12:54,520
Don't worry, Shuhong.

202
00:12:54,760 --> 00:12:56,640
I'm an expert in handling this.

203
00:12:56,840 --> 00:12:59,000
I'll smooth things out for you.

204
00:12:59,540 --> 00:13:01,610
Back then, men would fight
tooth and nail over me,

205
00:13:01,610 --> 00:13:03,880
having bloody battles from
all the jealousy.

206
00:13:03,880 --> 00:13:05,210
There were tons of them.

207
00:13:06,520 --> 00:13:07,040
What,

208
00:13:07,390 --> 00:13:08,590
you don't believe me?

209
00:13:09,470 --> 00:13:10,550
When Renjun comes back later,

210
00:13:10,550 --> 00:13:11,360
you can ask him

211
00:13:11,520 --> 00:13:12,920
how he got me to marry him.

212
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,000
You know what?

213
00:13:16,520 --> 00:13:17,760
My former master

214
00:13:17,990 --> 00:13:18,930
almost stabbed Renjun's nose

215
00:13:18,930 --> 00:13:20,290
with a small knife.

216
00:13:20,570 --> 00:13:22,050
His ear almost got cut off,

217
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:23,120
but

218
00:13:23,280 --> 00:13:24,790
Renjun didn't even blink.

219
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:26,260
It was because of this

220
00:13:26,260 --> 00:13:27,260
that I realized

221
00:13:27,880 --> 00:13:28,650
Renjun

222
00:13:28,760 --> 00:13:29,880
truly cares for me.

223
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:33,520
Otherwise,

224
00:13:33,520 --> 00:13:36,180
how could I have stayed married to him
until now?

225
00:13:41,580 --> 00:13:47,510
[Sixth Division Armory]

226
00:13:42,940 --> 00:13:44,460
The weapon maintenance of
the Sixth Division

227
00:13:44,460 --> 00:13:45,510
is first-class.

228
00:13:48,520 --> 00:13:50,250
Thank you for your praise, Sir.

229
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:51,670
The weapon integrity rate

230
00:13:51,670 --> 00:13:53,240
is easy to achieve in a static state.

231
00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:54,760
It's a different story in field use.

232
00:13:54,760 --> 00:13:55,520
Not to mention

233
00:13:55,520 --> 00:13:57,520
weapon repair under combat damage.

234
00:13:57,520 --> 00:13:58,760
Can your Twelfth Brigade

235
00:13:58,760 --> 00:13:59,550
manage that?

236
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:00,880
In this autumn military drill,

237
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:01,550
there are a total of five
artillery technicians

238
00:14:01,550 --> 00:14:02,880
coming with the troop,

239
00:14:03,060 --> 00:14:05,190
but I guess none of them will be needed.

240
00:14:06,640 --> 00:14:07,520
Why is that?

241
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:10,360
According to the regulations
just issued to my unit

242
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:12,040
by the autumn military drill
headquarters,

243
00:14:12,040 --> 00:14:12,760
all ammunition is to be

244
00:14:12,760 --> 00:14:13,710
kept by the First Brigade of
the Imperial Guards

245
00:14:13,710 --> 00:14:14,670
for our unit.

246
00:14:15,400 --> 00:14:16,710
Without ammunition,

247
00:14:16,710 --> 00:14:17,490
aren't these firearms

248
00:14:17,490 --> 00:14:19,620
just a bunch of useless hunks of metal?

249
00:14:19,810 --> 00:14:21,810
Isn't this a bit of an overreaction?

250
00:14:22,470 --> 00:14:23,710
If the people along the way

251
00:14:23,710 --> 00:14:24,640
get wind of this,

252
00:14:24,640 --> 00:14:26,360
who knows how they might ridicule us?

253
00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:27,470
Where is the military prestige then?

254
00:14:27,470 --> 00:14:29,330
How can we intimidate the rebels?

255
00:14:29,880 --> 00:14:31,040
If the court doesn't even
trust the main force

256
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:32,170
of the Beiyang Army,

257
00:14:32,520 --> 00:14:33,760
who can they trust?

258
00:14:37,670 --> 00:14:39,760
Send a telegram to the
autumn military drill headquarters,

259
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:41,420
saying it was my instruction,

260
00:14:41,880 --> 00:14:43,050
that the ammunition of the Sixth Division

261
00:14:43,050 --> 00:14:44,640
will no longer be kept by
the Imperial Guards,

262
00:14:44,640 --> 00:14:46,770
but will be carried by the unit itself.

263
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:47,640
Yes, Sir.

264
00:14:52,670 --> 00:14:54,600
I made a visit to Germany recently,

265
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:56,520
and it was an eye-opener.

266
00:14:57,120 --> 00:14:57,640
Germany

267
00:14:57,760 --> 00:14:59,470
stores its military supplies among
the civilian population,

268
00:14:59,470 --> 00:15:01,400
benefiting both in times of peace and war.

269
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:02,730
Just to give an example,

270
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:04,240
their nails and screws,

271
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:05,300
as well as nuts and bolts

272
00:15:05,300 --> 00:15:06,550
are standardized for both
military and civilian use,

273
00:15:06,550 --> 00:15:07,670
and manufactured uniformly.

274
00:15:07,670 --> 00:15:09,130
If a war really breaks out,

275
00:15:09,370 --> 00:15:10,880
any vehicle of the German army,

276
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:11,970
be it a car, a carriage,

277
00:15:11,970 --> 00:15:14,080
or an artillery wagon, if a nail breaks,

278
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:15,640
they can go to a civilian's home,

279
00:15:15,640 --> 00:15:17,040
take apart a table or a chair,

280
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:18,760
and find a suitable matching nail,

281
00:15:18,760 --> 00:15:19,640
screw, or bolt.

282
00:15:22,120 --> 00:15:24,450
The West is stronger than our Qing dynasty

283
00:15:24,640 --> 00:15:26,500
for no other reason than one word:

284
00:15:26,760 --> 00:15:29,040
far-sighted.

285
00:15:29,520 --> 00:15:30,920
They make a plan for every matter,

286
00:15:30,920 --> 00:15:32,720
deciding it 15 years in advance,

287
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:34,140
so when the time comes,

288
00:15:34,280 --> 00:15:35,940
everything falls into place.

289
00:15:36,360 --> 00:15:37,120
As for us,

290
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:39,640
for tomorrow's matters,

291
00:15:39,670 --> 00:15:41,200
we still have no plan today.

292
00:15:42,120 --> 00:15:42,550
Look,

293
00:15:43,470 --> 00:15:45,670
there are only two days left
before departure,

294
00:15:45,670 --> 00:15:46,880
but even now,

295
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:49,090
I, the commander of a division,

296
00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:51,800
have not yet received the marching orders.

297
00:15:58,220 --> 00:15:59,260
Kaizhi,

298
00:16:00,520 --> 00:16:01,720
you must understand.

299
00:16:02,760 --> 00:16:04,090
In these special times,

300
00:16:04,670 --> 00:16:06,730
the formulation of military actions

301
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:09,160
is more for political considerations.

302
00:16:14,220 --> 00:16:15,180
Let's

303
00:16:15,460 --> 00:16:17,190
conclude here for the morning.

304
00:16:21,470 --> 00:16:23,640
Has your beloved arrived?

305
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:24,880
Take us

306
00:16:25,140 --> 00:16:25,940
to have a look.

307
00:17:26,750 --> 00:17:28,020
The world is vast,

308
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:31,320
and you, Kaizhi, have so many women,

309
00:17:31,320 --> 00:17:32,300
to choose from.

310
00:17:45,560 --> 00:17:46,320
Fenglan!

311
00:17:46,950 --> 00:17:47,670
Fenglan!

312
00:17:48,430 --> 00:17:49,230
Coming.

313
00:17:49,320 --> 00:17:50,030
Coming.

314
00:17:50,710 --> 00:17:51,320
You're here.

315
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:52,270
Come on in.

316
00:17:52,560 --> 00:17:54,750
-Come on, Viceroy Liang.
-Please come in.

317
00:17:54,750 --> 00:17:56,410
I've got the tea ready for you.

318
00:17:56,440 --> 00:17:57,000
Kaizhi.

319
00:18:01,850 --> 00:18:02,680
You're here.

320
00:18:07,750 --> 00:18:08,560
Fenglan.

321
00:18:08,920 --> 00:18:10,380
Your outfit today is nice.

322
00:18:10,670 --> 00:18:11,280
Renjun.

323
00:18:11,710 --> 00:18:13,030
Your wife knows how to dress.

324
00:18:13,030 --> 00:18:14,830
And she's bold enough to wear it.

325
00:18:15,740 --> 00:18:16,710
This outfit of hers

326
00:18:16,710 --> 00:18:18,370
was tailored with Shuhong's help
two years ago.

327
00:18:18,370 --> 00:18:19,800
They say it's a fashionable Tokyo style.

328
00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:20,320
I don't really understand these things.

329
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:21,510
Isn't that right, Shuhong?

330
00:18:21,510 --> 00:18:23,000
Tell me about it.

331
00:18:23,710 --> 00:18:24,800
Those who have studied abroad

332
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:26,030
are indeed different.

333
00:18:26,030 --> 00:18:27,120
In the Japanese market,

334
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:28,230
there are so many patterns, styles,

335
00:18:28,230 --> 00:18:29,470
and beautiful clothes.

336
00:18:29,470 --> 00:18:30,230
Our Shuhong

337
00:18:30,230 --> 00:18:32,560
can cut, tailor, and sew everything.

338
00:18:33,190 --> 00:18:34,970
Besides, I'm not really that
daring in what I wear.

339
00:18:34,970 --> 00:18:37,000
Now, Japanese women, they're really
daring in their dress.

340
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,270
Women's blouses expose
about a foot of arm,

341
00:18:39,270 --> 00:18:41,270
and women's trousers are raised
more than a foot high.

342
00:18:41,270 --> 00:18:43,800
They wear a red foreign gauze
vest underneath,

343
00:18:43,800 --> 00:18:46,430
with a lace shawl on top.

344
00:18:46,920 --> 00:18:48,710
The rules in Beijing are much stricter.

345
00:18:48,710 --> 00:18:49,950
Although there are one or two

346
00:18:49,950 --> 00:18:51,560
bold women of questionable reputation,

347
00:18:51,560 --> 00:18:52,240
at most,

348
00:18:52,270 --> 00:18:53,530
they just wear a qipao.

349
00:18:53,710 --> 00:18:55,030
The qipao is the most difficult to make,

350
00:18:55,030 --> 00:18:56,510
especially the form-fitting type.

351
00:18:56,510 --> 00:18:58,670
You need to know how to take measurements
and tailor.

352
00:18:58,670 --> 00:18:59,600
Right, Shuhong?

353
00:19:02,750 --> 00:19:03,430
Kaizhi.

354
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:06,680
How come I didn't know

355
00:19:07,420 --> 00:19:09,620
that Shuhong knows Western tailoring?

356
00:19:11,190 --> 00:19:12,850
It's just a piece of clothing,

357
00:19:13,380 --> 00:19:14,980
nothing to make a fuss about.

358
00:19:20,120 --> 00:19:21,180
A piece of clothing

359
00:19:21,320 --> 00:19:23,050
might not be a big deal in Tokyo,

360
00:19:23,320 --> 00:19:25,020
but it's a big deal here.

361
00:19:26,270 --> 00:19:27,800
Aren't there revolutionaries

362
00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:29,320
using women's foot unbinding,
hair cutting,

363
00:19:29,320 --> 00:19:31,250
and breast binding to make a point?

364
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:32,000
Kaizhi.

365
00:19:33,560 --> 00:19:34,950
China is not like Tokyo.

366
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:37,500
Moving the position of a stove

367
00:19:38,370 --> 00:19:40,030
could even lead to bloodshed.

368
00:19:54,230 --> 00:19:55,030
Aren't we here today

369
00:19:55,030 --> 00:19:55,800
for a meal?

370
00:19:55,880 --> 00:19:57,640
Renjun, where's the food?

371
00:19:58,430 --> 00:20:00,080
Yes, right. This way please,
Viceroy Liang.

372
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:00,950
Fenglan, serve the dishes quickly.

373
00:20:00,950 --> 00:20:02,280
Alright, just a moment.

374
00:20:03,320 --> 00:20:04,710
Come on, have a taste.

375
00:20:04,800 --> 00:20:05,600
Sauerkraut, pork belly, and blood sausage

376
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:06,920
are a signature dish

377
00:20:06,920 --> 00:20:08,190
at the northern frontier.

378
00:20:08,190 --> 00:20:09,230
I asked him, since Viceroy Liang
was coming,

379
00:20:09,230 --> 00:20:10,710
shouldn't we prepare something
more luxurious?

380
00:20:10,710 --> 00:20:11,570
But Renjun said

381
00:20:11,710 --> 00:20:12,430
your ancestral home is actually in

382
00:20:12,430 --> 00:20:13,730
the frontier region, Viceroy Liang.

383
00:20:13,730 --> 00:20:15,430
Since you've come to our place
of rising fortune,

384
00:20:15,430 --> 00:20:17,710
you should have some of our
ancestral dishes, right?

385
00:20:17,710 --> 00:20:18,600
The pork belly here

386
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:20,030
comes from local black pigs,

387
00:20:20,030 --> 00:20:22,160
the blood sausage is freshly stuffed,

388
00:20:22,190 --> 00:20:23,430
and I personally made

389
00:20:23,430 --> 00:20:24,670
this sauerkraut.

390
00:20:24,840 --> 00:20:26,430
This is the good thing about the barracks.

391
00:20:26,430 --> 00:20:28,800
There are as many of common dishes
as we need.

392
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:30,030
Shuhong, try this.

393
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:31,320
Try this sausage.

394
00:20:31,370 --> 00:20:32,680
Is it similar to what you made in Tokyo?

395
00:20:32,680 --> 00:20:34,680
Are you comfortable with the taste?

396
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:37,430
Try it.

397
00:20:37,510 --> 00:20:38,270
Shuhong.

398
00:20:39,060 --> 00:20:40,610
The sausage you made in Tokyo

399
00:20:40,610 --> 00:20:42,010
doesn't taste like this.

400
00:20:42,560 --> 00:20:43,820
The meat is different.

401
00:20:44,030 --> 00:20:45,950
Japanese pigs are bigger and
produce more meat.

402
00:20:45,950 --> 00:20:46,830
The flavor isn't as fresh.

403
00:20:46,830 --> 00:20:48,510
It requires more curry powder.

404
00:20:48,510 --> 00:20:49,120
Japanese soldiers

405
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:50,920
can't have a meal without curry.

406
00:20:52,030 --> 00:20:52,560
Tufang.

407
00:20:52,560 --> 00:20:54,090
Come on, let's have a toast.

408
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:55,770
Don't toast with me.

409
00:20:56,190 --> 00:20:57,920
You should toast with the guest of honor

410
00:20:57,920 --> 00:20:58,810
at this table.

411
00:21:02,230 --> 00:21:02,920
Did you hear that?

412
00:21:02,920 --> 00:21:03,600
High-ranking officials

413
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:04,950
are indeed different from us.

414
00:21:04,950 --> 00:21:05,950
How attentive.

415
00:21:06,030 --> 00:21:07,560
So who's the guest of honor at this table?

416
00:21:07,560 --> 00:21:09,160
It's our Shuhong, of course.

417
00:21:09,270 --> 00:21:10,080
Come on.

418
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:11,190
On behalf of Viceroy Liang,

419
00:21:11,190 --> 00:21:13,270
I'd like to toast you, our guest
from afar.

420
00:21:13,270 --> 00:21:14,080
Guest?

421
00:21:15,470 --> 00:21:16,950
Should I be considered a guest?

422
00:21:16,950 --> 00:21:19,430
Indeed. You can't really be considered
a guest.

423
00:21:19,430 --> 00:21:21,830
If anything, you're a military dependent.

424
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:23,800
Right, right. A military dependent.

425
00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:26,530
Come on, let your military dependent
join us too.

426
00:21:27,190 --> 00:21:27,990
I'm really

427
00:21:27,990 --> 00:21:29,270
an unlucky military dependent.

428
00:21:29,270 --> 00:21:31,230
I have to join in every time
there's drinking.

429
00:21:31,230 --> 00:21:32,840
With so many battalion commanders
under him,

430
00:21:32,840 --> 00:21:33,950
they all come to toast one by one.

431
00:21:33,950 --> 00:21:35,810
I always end up completely drunk.

432
00:21:35,950 --> 00:21:36,710
Fenglan.

433
00:21:37,850 --> 00:21:39,270
If you can't drink, then don't.

434
00:21:39,270 --> 00:21:40,230
That won't do.

435
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:41,710
Viceroy Liang has already given the order.

436
00:21:41,710 --> 00:21:42,750
On behalf of Viceroy Liang,

437
00:21:42,750 --> 00:21:44,680
I'll toast you, our honored guest.

438
00:21:44,950 --> 00:21:45,950
Military dependent.

439
00:21:45,950 --> 00:21:46,750
Right, right.

440
00:21:46,920 --> 00:21:48,950
Military dependent. It's a toast between
military dependents then.

441
00:21:48,950 --> 00:21:50,340
Come on, bottoms up.

442
00:22:03,270 --> 00:22:05,430
On this trip to France,

443
00:22:05,750 --> 00:22:06,710
I finally got to witness

444
00:22:06,710 --> 00:22:08,800
Lord Zaitao's horsemanship firsthand.

445
00:22:08,800 --> 00:22:09,560
Kaizhi.

446
00:22:09,950 --> 00:22:11,320
Actually, the most suitable candidate

447
00:22:11,320 --> 00:22:12,650
for Director of Cavalry

448
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:14,260
should be Lord Zaitao.

449
00:22:15,800 --> 00:22:16,950
I've always heard praise on
Lord Zaitao's horsemanship,

450
00:22:16,950 --> 00:22:19,670
but I've never seen it myself.

451
00:22:19,800 --> 00:22:20,800
Is it really that good?

452
00:22:20,800 --> 00:22:22,200
It's more than just good.

453
00:22:22,710 --> 00:22:23,840
In the outskirts of Paris,

454
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:25,500
at the Saumur Cavalry School,

455
00:22:25,560 --> 00:22:26,950
the host brought out

456
00:22:27,030 --> 00:22:28,950
an Anglo-Norman horse

457
00:22:29,270 --> 00:22:31,710
for our group of Chinese guests
to try riding.

458
00:22:31,710 --> 00:22:33,590
Anglo-Norman?

459
00:22:34,560 --> 00:22:37,230
A French horse ought to have
a French name, don't you think?

460
00:22:37,230 --> 00:22:38,470
The French were so hospitable.

461
00:22:38,470 --> 00:22:40,560
As guests, we couldn't turn down
their kind offer.

462
00:22:40,560 --> 00:22:42,030
Several of our delegation tried riding it.

463
00:22:42,030 --> 00:22:43,890
They all fell flat on their backs.

464
00:22:44,560 --> 00:22:45,510
What a scene.

465
00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:47,080
No horse between their legs,

466
00:22:47,080 --> 00:22:48,280
no rider on the horse.

467
00:22:48,560 --> 00:22:49,800
I found it strange too.

468
00:22:49,800 --> 00:22:51,600
This horse wasn't unruly or fierce.

469
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:52,800
It was even well-trained.

470
00:22:52,800 --> 00:22:54,400
Why couldn't anyone ride it?

471
00:22:54,560 --> 00:22:56,030
The owner didn't explain anything.

472
00:22:56,030 --> 00:22:57,690
He just watched from the side.

473
00:22:57,950 --> 00:22:59,350
I wanted to try it myself.

474
00:22:59,430 --> 00:23:00,890
Lord Zaitao stopped me.

475
00:23:00,920 --> 00:23:01,470
He said,

476
00:23:02,030 --> 00:23:02,810
"I'll do it."

477
00:23:06,230 --> 00:23:07,890
Could it be a trap,

478
00:23:07,920 --> 00:23:10,050
to embarrass Qing dynasty officials?

479
00:23:11,080 --> 00:23:11,970
Maybe.

480
00:23:12,430 --> 00:23:14,320
But you really shouldn't think that way.

481
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:16,180
That would be petty, wouldn't it?

482
00:23:16,360 --> 00:23:17,360
Exactly.

483
00:23:17,560 --> 00:23:18,800
When in Rome, do as the Romans do.

484
00:23:18,800 --> 00:23:20,930
We have to keep up appearances, right?

485
00:23:21,710 --> 00:23:23,710
Don't interrupt. Listen to Tufang.

486
00:23:24,270 --> 00:23:25,730
Lord Zaitao was really capable.

487
00:23:25,730 --> 00:23:27,750
He walked over but didn't mount the horse.

488
00:23:27,750 --> 00:23:29,800
Instead, he gently patted its back.

489
00:23:30,190 --> 00:23:31,560
The horse really understood him.

490
00:23:31,560 --> 00:23:33,360
It immediately neighed loudly.

491
00:23:35,650 --> 00:23:37,180
Emotional communication?

492
00:23:37,980 --> 00:23:39,900
Horses also have a language.

493
00:23:40,230 --> 00:23:41,080
That's right.

494
00:23:41,270 --> 00:23:42,710
It's this neighing sound

495
00:23:42,800 --> 00:23:44,640
that gave Lord Zaitao confidence.

496
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:46,800
He understood its nature and mounted it.

497
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:48,800
He flipped over and got on the horse.

498
00:23:52,470 --> 00:23:54,560
Well, he's keeping us in suspense.

499
00:23:54,850 --> 00:23:57,110
Viceroy Liang is like a storyteller now.

500
00:23:57,110 --> 00:23:58,350
Cover your ears.

501
00:23:58,800 --> 00:23:59,950
We're not listening anymore.

502
00:23:59,950 --> 00:24:01,560
Can you show a bit of backbone?

503
00:24:01,560 --> 00:24:02,620
Don't.

504
00:24:03,080 --> 00:24:03,710
Kaizhi,

505
00:24:03,810 --> 00:24:05,750
who's the highest-ranking
official at this table?

506
00:24:05,750 --> 00:24:06,670
It's Tufang.

507
00:24:06,750 --> 00:24:08,030
If you don't listen to the commander,

508
00:24:08,030 --> 00:24:09,290
who will you listen to?

509
00:24:11,470 --> 00:24:12,800
Do you know how Lord Zaitao

510
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:14,260
performed on horseback?

511
00:24:14,950 --> 00:24:16,360
He made the horse dance.

512
00:24:17,180 --> 00:24:18,750
Three steps forward, three steps back.

513
00:24:18,750 --> 00:24:20,810
Three steps left, three steps right.

514
00:24:20,950 --> 00:24:22,190
A waltz.

515
00:24:22,430 --> 00:24:23,360
The French owner.

516
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:25,160
immediately started clapping.

517
00:24:25,950 --> 00:24:27,030
It turns out

518
00:24:27,270 --> 00:24:28,670
this horse

519
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:31,270
was specifically trained for dancing.

520
00:24:33,800 --> 00:24:34,800
That's it?

521
00:24:36,510 --> 00:24:38,030
Look how silly you are.

522
00:24:38,560 --> 00:24:40,030
Women don't understand.

523
00:24:41,080 --> 00:24:42,480
Listening is pointless.

524
00:24:43,560 --> 00:24:45,550
Lord Zaitao truly has this skill?

525
00:24:46,750 --> 00:24:48,950
If he put the same effort
he uses with horses

526
00:24:48,950 --> 00:24:51,010
into the Military Advisory Council,

527
00:24:51,190 --> 00:24:52,330
I think, Tufang,

528
00:24:52,580 --> 00:24:54,710
you wouldn't have much to worry about.

529
00:24:59,560 --> 00:25:00,670
Don't say that.

530
00:25:01,030 --> 00:25:02,560
He still has his strengths.

531
00:25:07,850 --> 00:25:08,730
Tufang.

532
00:25:09,710 --> 00:25:11,950
You need to pass a message to Lord Zaitao.

533
00:25:11,950 --> 00:25:12,950
Tell Lord Zaitao

534
00:25:12,950 --> 00:25:14,750
to stop being a scout for horses.

535
00:25:14,950 --> 00:25:16,750
Be a talent scout for people too.

536
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:23,270
Shuhong.

537
00:25:24,030 --> 00:25:25,030
Did you hear it?

538
00:25:25,270 --> 00:25:26,820
These two are just like this.

539
00:25:26,820 --> 00:25:28,430
Just like on the ship to Tokyo back then,

540
00:25:28,430 --> 00:25:30,360
they're smooth talkers as always.

541
00:25:31,350 --> 00:25:32,870
What's the saying again?

542
00:25:34,230 --> 00:25:35,540
Right, Kaizhi.

543
00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:37,030
It's written

544
00:25:37,030 --> 00:25:38,080
on the painting hanging from the wall

545
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:39,210
in your residence.

546
00:25:40,560 --> 00:25:43,490
"If life could remain
the way it was when we first met,

547
00:25:43,610 --> 00:25:44,870
there would be no grief

548
00:25:45,190 --> 00:25:47,050
over the past on the painted fan."

549
00:26:03,470 --> 00:26:04,080
Buzhou.

550
00:26:04,430 --> 00:26:05,800
There's nothing left to guard here.

551
00:26:05,800 --> 00:26:06,980
Go to the garden area.

552
00:26:06,980 --> 00:26:08,580
Assist the Viceroy's guard.

553
00:26:08,670 --> 00:26:09,510
That's the key security area.

554
00:26:09,510 --> 00:26:10,510
We absolutely can't let anything go wrong.

555
00:26:10,510 --> 00:26:11,040
Yes, sir.

556
00:26:23,540 --> 00:26:24,200
We're home.

557
00:26:24,360 --> 00:26:25,220
Please come in.

558
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:29,950
This place is so huge.

559
00:26:30,950 --> 00:26:32,150
Big but impractical.

560
00:26:34,230 --> 00:26:36,560
This is the style of
the Beiyang Army's commander.

561
00:26:36,560 --> 00:26:37,750
If it were someone else,

562
00:26:37,750 --> 00:26:39,920
this place would be filled with
all kinds of treasures by now.

563
00:26:39,920 --> 00:26:41,510
They wanted to furnish it for me,

564
00:26:41,510 --> 00:26:42,710
but I didn't let them.

565
00:26:43,190 --> 00:26:44,520
The bedroom is this way.

566
00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:50,710
How is it?

567
00:26:53,030 --> 00:26:53,750
Roses!

568
00:26:54,760 --> 00:26:56,040
And they're yellow.

569
00:26:58,080 --> 00:27:00,190
These flowers don't even
grow in this area.

570
00:27:00,190 --> 00:27:01,750
Do you know who arranged this?

571
00:27:01,750 --> 00:27:02,470
Li Renjun.

572
00:27:03,030 --> 00:27:04,430
He asked someone from the railway

573
00:27:04,430 --> 00:27:05,830
to get these from Tianjin

574
00:27:06,030 --> 00:27:07,160
especially for you.

575
00:27:07,310 --> 00:27:09,110
Don't you think he's something?

576
00:27:09,750 --> 00:27:12,510
The relationship between you three
is so strange.

577
00:27:12,510 --> 00:27:13,310
Is it strange?

578
00:27:15,430 --> 00:27:16,640
If it were anyone else,

579
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:18,190
no one would be able to eat anything

580
00:27:18,190 --> 00:27:19,450
at the dinner tonight.

581
00:27:20,270 --> 00:27:22,680
Yet you three were so peaceful
and harmonious,

582
00:27:22,680 --> 00:27:24,080
full of laughter and joy.

583
00:27:24,230 --> 00:27:25,430
You take a bath first.

584
00:27:25,560 --> 00:27:26,960
The bathroom is this way.

585
00:27:34,710 --> 00:27:35,320
I told them tonight

586
00:27:35,320 --> 00:27:36,920
to not let anyone disturb us.

587
00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:39,690
I've even disconnected the phone.

588
00:27:39,710 --> 00:27:40,970
It's just the two of us.

589
00:28:06,030 --> 00:28:07,030
Stop right there!

590
00:28:07,080 --> 00:28:07,940
Who goes there?

591
00:28:12,660 --> 00:28:13,920
Brigade Commander Li.

592
00:28:15,270 --> 00:28:17,320
This is Brigade Commander Li
from the Twelfth Brigade.

593
00:28:17,320 --> 00:28:18,450
Lower your weapons.

594
00:28:21,090 --> 00:28:22,550
Do you have business here?

595
00:28:23,670 --> 00:28:25,270
Just visiting an old friend.

596
00:28:25,360 --> 00:28:25,880
I'm sorry,

597
00:28:25,880 --> 00:28:27,880
but you can't bring your gun inside.

598
00:28:31,560 --> 00:28:32,820
I'm not carrying a gun.

599
00:28:44,270 --> 00:28:45,420
Please follow me.

600
00:29:13,420 --> 00:29:14,220
Commander Li.

601
00:29:16,270 --> 00:29:17,670
He's on the second floor.

602
00:29:23,510 --> 00:29:25,320
Commander Zhang Shaozeng
of the 20th Division

603
00:29:25,320 --> 00:29:26,190
and Commander Lan Tianwei

604
00:29:26,190 --> 00:29:27,320
of the 2nd Mixed Brigade

605
00:29:27,320 --> 00:29:28,800
were both cadets in Japan.

606
00:29:28,970 --> 00:29:30,320
They have a close relationship.

607
00:29:30,320 --> 00:29:31,670
The camping locations of these two units

608
00:29:31,670 --> 00:29:32,530
must be kept separate

609
00:29:32,530 --> 00:29:33,880
to prevent collusion.

610
00:29:35,560 --> 00:29:36,090
Alright.

611
00:29:36,750 --> 00:29:37,430
That's all.

612
00:29:41,800 --> 00:29:42,430
Come in.

613
00:29:49,750 --> 00:29:50,610
Viceroy Liang.

614
00:30:13,390 --> 00:30:15,120
I just want to lie here like this

615
00:30:17,190 --> 00:30:18,590
and never to get up again.

616
00:30:20,510 --> 00:30:21,560
Just like this,

617
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:23,320
quietly,

618
00:30:24,430 --> 00:30:25,270
quietly.

619
00:30:25,710 --> 00:30:26,840
Then let's be quiet.

620
00:30:27,920 --> 00:30:29,160
Don't say anything

621
00:30:29,190 --> 00:30:30,590
or think about anything.

622
00:30:30,750 --> 00:30:32,410
I can stay with you until dawn.

623
00:30:40,400 --> 00:30:41,290
Tell me,

624
00:30:42,800 --> 00:30:44,860
am I not suited to command troops?

625
00:30:46,140 --> 00:30:47,200
Why do you say that?

626
00:30:48,270 --> 00:30:51,130
People who command troops
should be like Li Renjun.

627
00:30:51,850 --> 00:30:53,050
He has a big appetite.

628
00:30:53,190 --> 00:30:54,320
He eats everything.

629
00:30:54,710 --> 00:30:56,440
Everything tastes good to him.

630
00:30:56,800 --> 00:30:57,950
You're too picky.

631
00:30:58,270 --> 00:30:59,510
Too selective.

632
00:31:00,120 --> 00:31:01,800
You want everything to be perfect.

633
00:31:01,800 --> 00:31:02,950
There's no such thing as perfection.

634
00:31:02,950 --> 00:31:03,950
There is.

635
00:31:04,750 --> 00:31:05,800
You are perfect.

636
00:31:06,030 --> 00:31:07,230
Don't be ridiculous.

637
00:31:07,470 --> 00:31:08,400
How am I perfect?

638
00:31:10,230 --> 00:31:10,950
Naively,

639
00:31:10,950 --> 00:31:12,190
I followed that man,

640
00:31:13,560 --> 00:31:14,840
searching in a

641
00:31:14,840 --> 00:31:15,700
dark building.

642
00:31:16,270 --> 00:31:17,870
Searching for what I wanted,

643
00:31:18,820 --> 00:31:20,170
I fell and got bruised.

644
00:31:21,800 --> 00:31:23,510
When I finally saw the light,

645
00:31:26,950 --> 00:31:28,550
I'd already lost my chastity

646
00:31:28,840 --> 00:31:29,870
and my youth.

647
00:31:30,820 --> 00:31:32,480
I never asked that much of you.

648
00:31:33,270 --> 00:31:35,560
You're at your best right now.

649
00:31:36,430 --> 00:31:37,690
Everything a man needs

650
00:31:38,030 --> 00:31:38,800
can be

651
00:31:39,270 --> 00:31:40,270
found in you.

652
00:31:43,080 --> 00:31:44,480
Just those eyes of yours,

653
00:31:44,710 --> 00:31:45,730
so big and gentle.

654
00:31:46,470 --> 00:31:47,510
Through them,

655
00:31:48,270 --> 00:31:48,840
I feel like I can

656
00:31:48,840 --> 00:31:50,350
walk into your soul.

657
00:31:52,030 --> 00:31:53,670
You're also a top-notch man.

658
00:31:54,090 --> 00:31:55,350
What's with your head?

659
00:31:55,930 --> 00:31:58,100
I bet it would make a crisp sound
if I knocked on it,

660
00:31:58,100 --> 00:31:59,700
all the way down to your toes.

661
00:31:59,950 --> 00:32:00,950
Then knock on it.

662
00:32:01,190 --> 00:32:02,560
See if it reaches my toes.

663
00:32:02,560 --> 00:32:03,760
Alright, I'll knock.

664
00:32:04,800 --> 00:32:05,950
Be gentle.

665
00:32:06,030 --> 00:32:06,840
Don't knock

666
00:32:06,840 --> 00:32:08,270
my intelligence away.

667
00:32:09,120 --> 00:32:09,960
My man

668
00:32:10,030 --> 00:32:11,760
will never exhaust his wisdom.

669
00:32:12,510 --> 00:32:13,190
Is that so?

670
00:32:13,430 --> 00:32:14,030
Of course.

671
00:32:14,270 --> 00:32:15,430
How could those smooth-talking,

672
00:32:15,430 --> 00:32:17,360
worldly-wise Li Renjuns compare?

673
00:32:17,560 --> 00:32:18,890
Are you encouraging me?

674
00:32:19,080 --> 00:32:19,560
No.

675
00:32:20,430 --> 00:32:22,230
What you've done and will do

676
00:32:22,510 --> 00:32:24,030
is for the entire nation.

677
00:32:24,330 --> 00:32:25,320
You are truly filled with

678
00:32:25,320 --> 00:32:26,190
revolutionary

679
00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:27,450
courage and ideals.

680
00:32:28,010 --> 00:32:30,340
You don't care about personal gain at all.

681
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:31,680
Perhaps one day,

682
00:32:32,070 --> 00:32:33,470
this country will build

683
00:32:33,470 --> 00:32:35,330
a memorial wall for its pioneers.

684
00:32:35,560 --> 00:32:36,270
I'm certain

685
00:32:36,800 --> 00:32:37,800
our descendants

686
00:32:37,800 --> 00:32:39,030
will find

687
00:32:39,560 --> 00:32:40,320
a name called

688
00:32:40,320 --> 00:32:41,720
Yang Kaizhi on that wall.

689
00:32:44,560 --> 00:32:45,960
I will certainly achieve

690
00:32:46,710 --> 00:32:47,510
what you said.

691
00:32:49,430 --> 00:32:50,360
What did you say?

692
00:32:51,720 --> 00:32:52,650
What did you say?

693
00:32:53,800 --> 00:32:55,320
I was just trying to encourage you

694
00:32:55,320 --> 00:32:56,800
and you took it seriously.

695
00:32:57,080 --> 00:32:59,360
That's why you shouldn't say such things.

696
00:32:59,360 --> 00:33:00,600
Words can become
self-fulfilling prophecies.

697
00:33:00,600 --> 00:33:01,600
I don't want to be on that cold

698
00:33:01,600 --> 00:33:02,350
wall—

699
00:33:02,800 --> 00:33:03,600
I'm pinching your ear.

700
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:04,660
Quickly, spit it out,

701
00:33:04,660 --> 00:33:05,890
so you won't jinx yourself.

702
00:33:05,890 --> 00:33:06,430
Hurry up.

703
00:33:06,800 --> 00:33:07,800
Ptui, ptui, ptui.

704
00:33:27,320 --> 00:33:29,720
Is the domestic situation really that bad?

705
00:33:30,560 --> 00:33:31,960
Well, how should I put it?

706
00:33:32,950 --> 00:33:33,950
It's not something that can be explained

707
00:33:33,950 --> 00:33:35,270
in just a few words.

708
00:33:36,190 --> 00:33:38,390
Why are you suddenly asking about this?

709
00:33:38,950 --> 00:33:39,470
I just saw

710
00:33:39,470 --> 00:33:41,120
a bunch of busy people downstairs.

711
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:43,180
News from everywhere is coming here.

712
00:33:44,030 --> 00:33:46,030
Lord Zaitao doesn't care about anything.

713
00:33:46,030 --> 00:33:48,270
If you have to handle everything,
big or small,

714
00:33:48,270 --> 00:33:49,320
what can you say?

715
00:33:50,190 --> 00:33:51,450
It's better to be busy.

716
00:33:51,670 --> 00:33:54,670
It keeps you from thinking about
those more troubling things.

717
00:33:54,670 --> 00:33:56,000
More troubling things?

718
00:33:57,030 --> 00:33:57,950
That couple.

719
00:33:58,030 --> 00:33:58,950
I doubt you can

720
00:33:59,320 --> 00:34:00,560
not think about them.

721
00:34:01,110 --> 00:34:03,370
Why give yourself unnecessary trouble?

722
00:34:03,950 --> 00:34:06,230
An oil peddler winning the
heart of the top courtesan.

723
00:34:06,230 --> 00:34:07,230
Such a great thing

724
00:34:07,710 --> 00:34:09,070
only happens

725
00:34:09,070 --> 00:34:09,949
in novels.

726
00:34:11,550 --> 00:34:13,150
You're really open-minded.

727
00:34:18,110 --> 00:34:18,840
Oh, right.

728
00:34:20,400 --> 00:34:21,199
You've been in the Sixth Division

729
00:34:21,199 --> 00:34:22,929
for over half a year now, right?

730
00:34:23,400 --> 00:34:24,230
Do you think

731
00:34:25,199 --> 00:34:26,400
Kaizhi

732
00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:28,000
can be trusted?

733
00:34:35,429 --> 00:34:36,770
How should I put it?

734
00:34:40,510 --> 00:34:41,820
What's with your tone?

735
00:34:43,199 --> 00:34:44,860
This is a very serious matter.

736
00:34:47,630 --> 00:34:48,630
Tufang,

737
00:34:49,510 --> 00:34:50,780
I'm really not sure.

738
00:35:00,780 --> 00:35:02,300
What are you unsure of?

739
00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:09,030
If there's any sign of trouble,

740
00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:10,030
I'm unsure

741
00:35:10,030 --> 00:35:11,550
what the political stance

742
00:35:11,920 --> 00:35:13,650
his Sixth Division would have.

743
00:35:15,430 --> 00:35:16,630
Then what is

744
00:35:17,070 --> 00:35:18,630
your stance?

745
00:35:23,150 --> 00:35:25,030
I'm loyal to the court, of course.

746
00:35:25,590 --> 00:35:26,840
My salary comes from the emperor.

747
00:35:26,840 --> 00:35:28,040
The emperor feeds me.

748
00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:28,840
Even my bones

749
00:35:28,840 --> 00:35:30,150
belong to the emperor.

750
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:32,470
Why have you changed your tune?

751
00:35:32,470 --> 00:35:33,630
It's no longer your Mr. Yuan?

752
00:35:33,630 --> 00:35:34,400
Isn't the emperor

753
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:35,470
above Mr. Yuan?

754
00:35:35,590 --> 00:35:37,250
That's not necessarily true.

755
00:35:41,880 --> 00:35:42,680
Tufang,

756
00:35:43,430 --> 00:35:45,110
I know you're close to Kaizhi

757
00:35:45,110 --> 00:35:45,880
and distant from me.

758
00:35:45,880 --> 00:35:47,680
It's been like this since Tokyo,

759
00:35:47,680 --> 00:35:48,630
even if Yang Kaizhi

760
00:35:48,630 --> 00:35:49,890
is fundamentally a...

761
00:35:54,260 --> 00:35:55,260
A revolutionist.

762
00:36:16,030 --> 00:36:18,160
You can't say such things carelessly.

763
00:36:20,810 --> 00:36:22,030
Do you have any evidence?

764
00:36:22,030 --> 00:36:24,090
Every pore of my body feels that he is.

765
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:25,720
Every pore?

766
00:36:26,110 --> 00:36:26,920
Qianli,

767
00:36:27,200 --> 00:36:28,200
many people in court

768
00:36:28,200 --> 00:36:29,400
think with their pores

769
00:36:29,400 --> 00:36:30,070
like you.

770
00:36:30,330 --> 00:36:32,660
The stacks of similar accusation letters
are this tall.

771
00:36:32,660 --> 00:36:33,740
The Prince Regent crossed them out
with a red pen

772
00:36:33,740 --> 00:36:35,510
and sent them all back to Kaizhi himself.

773
00:36:35,510 --> 00:36:37,630
Is yours among them?

774
00:36:42,470 --> 00:36:43,930
How could I do such a thing?

775
00:36:44,550 --> 00:36:45,860
I only said it because you just asked me

776
00:36:45,860 --> 00:36:46,860
just now.

777
00:36:47,950 --> 00:36:49,750
I am not good at writing reports,

778
00:36:49,750 --> 00:36:51,810
especially not accusation letters.

779
00:36:51,840 --> 00:36:52,970
That's more like it.

780
00:36:54,030 --> 00:36:55,810
The autumn military drill is
about to begin.

781
00:36:55,810 --> 00:36:57,940
You two should work together closely.

782
00:37:04,430 --> 00:37:05,950
Since you brought it up,

783
00:37:06,430 --> 00:37:08,320
I have to report to you that

784
00:37:08,510 --> 00:37:09,070
today,

785
00:37:09,330 --> 00:37:10,770
during our meal,

786
00:37:11,430 --> 00:37:12,110
Gu Maichen

787
00:37:12,110 --> 00:37:13,200
has already arrived at my Brigade Office

788
00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:14,030
to start work.

789
00:37:14,050 --> 00:37:15,200
He's become the Chief of Staff

790
00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:16,030
of the Twelfth Brigade.

791
00:37:16,030 --> 00:37:17,260
The reason is quite simple.

792
00:37:17,260 --> 00:37:18,630
With the autumn military drill approaching,

793
00:37:18,630 --> 00:37:19,800
Maichen's better at writing

794
00:37:19,800 --> 00:37:21,200
military orders than me.

795
00:37:21,680 --> 00:37:23,630
Isn't this reason a bit far-fetched?

796
00:37:23,630 --> 00:37:25,110
To be frank, isn't it just Yang Kaizhi

797
00:37:25,110 --> 00:37:26,200
wanting to use Gu Maichen

798
00:37:26,200 --> 00:37:27,400
to strengthen his control

799
00:37:27,400 --> 00:37:28,860
over the Twelfth Brigade?

800
00:37:42,790 --> 00:37:43,940
What do you mean?

801
00:37:45,430 --> 00:37:47,760
Do you think that as a division commander,

802
00:37:47,780 --> 00:37:49,840
he shouldn't strengthen
his control

803
00:37:50,150 --> 00:37:50,740
over you?

804
00:38:06,590 --> 00:38:08,110
Good morning, Shuhong.

805
00:38:11,840 --> 00:38:12,770
Where's Kaizhi?

806
00:38:13,150 --> 00:38:15,110
He went to the cavalry's morning drills.

807
00:38:15,110 --> 00:38:17,180
Is that so? That's too much.

808
00:38:17,880 --> 00:38:18,800
What's so interesting about

809
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:20,530
the cavalry's morning drills?

810
00:38:20,840 --> 00:38:22,070
The troops are loading up this afternoon.

811
00:38:22,070 --> 00:38:24,330
He should be spending more time with you.

812
00:38:24,510 --> 00:38:25,030
Am I the type

813
00:38:25,030 --> 00:38:26,490
who needs companionship?

814
00:38:27,400 --> 00:38:28,200
I suppose not.

815
00:38:28,880 --> 00:38:29,400
You are a

816
00:38:29,400 --> 00:38:31,030
very self-reliant woman.

817
00:38:32,470 --> 00:38:34,130
Thank you for the compliment.

818
00:38:34,200 --> 00:38:35,260
Indeed, it's true.

819
00:38:40,500 --> 00:38:41,430
Is this your reason for

820
00:38:41,430 --> 00:38:43,030
separating me from my child?

821
00:38:44,590 --> 00:38:45,420
Partly, yes.

822
00:38:48,310 --> 00:38:49,380
How is the child?

823
00:38:51,360 --> 00:38:52,760
At the dinner last night,

824
00:38:52,880 --> 00:38:54,540
I was waiting for you to ask me,

825
00:38:54,680 --> 00:38:55,880
but you never did.

826
00:38:56,880 --> 00:38:57,880
It's just as well.

827
00:38:58,150 --> 00:38:59,610
We're better off this way.

828
00:39:01,150 --> 00:39:04,030
Yes, after all, we were classmates.

829
00:39:04,550 --> 00:39:05,110
There's no need to

830
00:39:05,110 --> 00:39:06,400
make an already complicated relationship

831
00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:07,880
even more complex.

832
00:39:08,430 --> 00:39:10,110
You didn't answer my question.

833
00:39:10,110 --> 00:39:11,570
Is it necessary to answer?

834
00:39:12,780 --> 00:39:14,450
You two are so sweet together.

835
00:39:14,880 --> 00:39:16,480
Do you even have time to care?

836
00:39:19,550 --> 00:39:21,150
When did you become so harsh?

837
00:39:22,510 --> 00:39:23,470
Am I harsh?

838
00:39:24,590 --> 00:39:25,840
I'm very tolerant.

839
00:39:26,910 --> 00:39:27,430
On this point,

840
00:39:27,430 --> 00:39:28,630
you can ask your beloved

841
00:39:28,630 --> 00:39:29,510
to find out.

842
00:39:30,320 --> 00:39:31,150
If I, Liang Tufang,

843
00:39:31,150 --> 00:39:32,800
had even a bit less magnanimity,

844
00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:33,680
I wouldn't have handed over

845
00:39:33,680 --> 00:39:34,430
the Sixth Division to him to lead.

846
00:39:34,430 --> 00:39:35,680
Don't talk about your official business.

847
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:37,120
That's between you men.

848
00:39:37,400 --> 00:39:39,260
I only want to talk about my child,

849
00:39:40,630 --> 00:39:42,490
because I am this child's mother.

850
00:39:42,680 --> 00:39:43,400
Fine.

851
00:39:44,630 --> 00:39:45,510
Mother.

852
00:39:47,030 --> 00:39:47,660
Yes.

853
00:39:48,510 --> 00:39:49,110
When a woman

854
00:39:49,110 --> 00:39:50,590
becomes a mother,

855
00:39:51,920 --> 00:39:53,030
she radiates

856
00:39:53,030 --> 00:39:54,470
a kind of great power.

857
00:39:55,400 --> 00:39:56,060
Look at you.

858
00:39:56,510 --> 00:39:58,240
The way you're looking at me now

859
00:39:58,430 --> 00:39:58,920
has become like

860
00:39:58,920 --> 00:40:00,200
that of a lioness.

861
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:07,320
Liang Xiang,

862
00:40:08,150 --> 00:40:10,360
don't think that because
you hold a high position,

863
00:40:10,360 --> 00:40:10,680
you can

864
00:40:10,680 --> 00:40:12,340
speak in such a flippant tone.

865
00:40:13,470 --> 00:40:14,400
To be honest,

866
00:40:15,200 --> 00:40:16,110
in my eyes,

867
00:40:16,880 --> 00:40:17,550
you're not much better

868
00:40:17,550 --> 00:40:19,080
than that military student

869
00:40:19,400 --> 00:40:20,590
on the ship.

870
00:40:21,500 --> 00:40:22,500
People like you

871
00:40:22,820 --> 00:40:24,420
are a dime a dozen in history.

872
00:40:25,590 --> 00:40:27,510
With power and interests in hand,

873
00:40:28,490 --> 00:40:30,750
you're still no different from the rest.

874
00:40:31,110 --> 00:40:31,590
You're still

875
00:40:31,590 --> 00:40:33,590
making the same historical mistakes.

876
00:40:33,590 --> 00:40:35,240
Apart from showing off

877
00:40:35,320 --> 00:40:36,120
in front of me,

878
00:40:36,240 --> 00:40:36,880
I don't see

879
00:40:36,880 --> 00:40:38,680
any other progress you've made.

880
00:40:39,110 --> 00:40:40,150
Don't take your power and interests

881
00:40:40,150 --> 00:40:41,010
too seriously.

882
00:40:41,470 --> 00:40:42,150
You should feel guilty

883
00:40:42,150 --> 00:40:43,680
that the country has become

884
00:40:43,930 --> 00:40:45,530
like this  because of you all.

885
00:40:47,470 --> 00:40:49,070
Look at your flowery outfit.

886
00:40:49,430 --> 00:40:50,690
What does it amount to?

887
00:40:51,480 --> 00:40:53,210
It'll all be nothing in the end.

888
00:40:56,270 --> 00:40:57,790
What do you mean, Shuhong?

889
00:40:58,400 --> 00:40:59,070
Your reckless words

890
00:40:59,070 --> 00:40:59,800
will affect

891
00:40:59,800 --> 00:41:01,400
your beloved's reputation.

892
00:41:02,590 --> 00:41:03,470
You are now the wife of

893
00:41:03,470 --> 00:41:05,030
the Sixth Division's commander.

894
00:41:05,030 --> 00:41:06,030
Every word you say

895
00:41:06,110 --> 00:41:06,840
represents

896
00:41:06,840 --> 00:41:08,570
his attitude and his position.

897
00:41:09,430 --> 00:41:10,400
I am myself,

898
00:41:10,720 --> 00:41:12,350
and my husband is my husband.

899
00:41:13,220 --> 00:41:14,620
It's just a bit of advice.

900
00:41:15,360 --> 00:41:16,760
Why use it to threaten me?

901
00:41:23,630 --> 00:41:24,630
Tufang's here?

902
00:41:25,110 --> 00:41:26,310
Why don't you come in?

903
00:41:28,110 --> 00:41:29,880
I don't think that's necessary.

904
00:41:29,880 --> 00:41:30,810
Commander Yang,

905
00:41:32,030 --> 00:41:33,030
at three o'clock this afternoon,

906
00:41:33,030 --> 00:41:36,030
the entire division will load up
and head to Yongping.

907
00:41:36,470 --> 00:41:37,370
Don't be late.

908
00:41:48,820 --> 00:41:50,080
What did you say to him?

909
00:41:50,590 --> 00:41:51,990
Why does he seem so angry?

910
00:41:54,340 --> 00:41:54,970
Nothing.

911
00:41:55,420 --> 00:41:57,020
I just asked him about my son.

912
00:42:14,800 --> 00:42:16,550
Kaizhi, you really are something.

913
00:42:16,550 --> 00:42:18,880
We're having the autumn military drill
and Fenglan is here too.

914
00:42:18,880 --> 00:42:19,400
Why don't you let Shuhong

915
00:42:19,400 --> 00:42:20,730
stay for a few more days?

916
00:42:21,680 --> 00:42:22,770
She's seen what she needed to see,

917
00:42:22,770 --> 00:42:24,430
and we've had our affectionate moments.

918
00:42:24,430 --> 00:42:26,960
She has matters to attend to
back in Shanghai.

919
00:42:28,070 --> 00:42:29,600
What time is the next train?

920
00:42:29,920 --> 00:42:30,920
5:11.

921
00:42:33,200 --> 00:42:34,920
You must accompany her
and see her onto the train.

922
00:42:34,920 --> 00:42:36,580
You don't need to tell me that.

923
00:42:37,590 --> 00:42:38,740
Attention!
