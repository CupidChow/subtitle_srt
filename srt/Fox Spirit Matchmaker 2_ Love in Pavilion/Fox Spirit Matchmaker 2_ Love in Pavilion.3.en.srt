00:01:40,570 --> 00:01:45,789
[Love in Pavilion]

00:01:46,270 --> 00:01:50,830
[Episode 3]

3
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:55,380
[10 days later]

4
00:02:04,980 --> 00:02:06,910
Divine Fire Villa is in seclusion.

5
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:09,380
This time, I'm taking action without permission.

6
00:02:09,380 --> 00:02:12,340
I hope my trip to Nangong's residence will be rewarding,

7
00:02:12,340 --> 00:02:14,530
and that I can save Mu Xiaowu for Yan.

8
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:22,240
Master Gu and Master Cheng have arrived.

9
00:02:25,190 --> 00:02:26,530
Master Gu!

10
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:28,000
Master Cheng.

11
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:30,820
Young Master Nangong.

12
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:31,750
This way.

13
00:02:32,079 --> 00:02:32,470
This way.

14
00:02:32,470 --> 00:02:32,800
After you.

15
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:35,910
Master Zhou and Master Han have arrived.

16
00:02:36,079 --> 00:02:37,000
Young Master Nangong.

17
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,090
Masters.

18
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:39,040
Go in, please.

19
00:02:39,460 --> 00:02:40,520
After you.

20
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:41,280
Let's go.

21
00:02:41,630 --> 00:02:44,560
Master Zhang Zheng has arrived.

22
00:02:49,910 --> 00:02:51,360
Master Zhang,

23
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:52,750
the Nangong family

24
00:02:53,030 --> 00:02:56,150
is honored to welcome your presence.

25
00:02:57,079 --> 00:02:57,960
Go in, please.

26
00:03:07,890 --> 00:03:10,330
Dark Sword Villa...

27
00:03:13,190 --> 00:03:15,560
Young Master Wangquan has arrived.

28
00:03:16,270 --> 00:03:18,620
Young Master Yang has arrived.

29
00:03:19,590 --> 00:03:20,960
Young Master Wangquan,

30
00:03:20,980 --> 00:03:23,400
we've been waiting for you. Go in, please.

31
00:03:27,030 --> 00:03:28,090
Young Master Yang,

32
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:30,930
the Yang family has fallen from grace.

33
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:34,430
Yet you can sponge off the Wangquan family
as their son-in-law.

34
00:03:34,430 --> 00:03:37,190
Your life is secured.

35
00:03:43,910 --> 00:03:44,710
Nangong Chui,

36
00:03:45,750 --> 00:03:46,800
what do you want?

37
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:48,500
Young Master Nangong,

38
00:03:48,870 --> 00:03:50,030
may I go in now?

39
00:03:53,030 --> 00:03:53,840
Yes, please.

40
00:04:29,270 --> 00:04:30,070
Yes.

41
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:10,390
It's Dongfang Huaizhu.

42
00:05:11,540 --> 00:05:13,120
Why is she here?

43
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:36,590
It seems like Nangong Ye's plan

44
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:38,510
has just started.

45
00:05:40,090 --> 00:05:41,260
Miss Dongfang,

46
00:05:41,700 --> 00:05:43,390
the man seated to my right

47
00:05:43,750 --> 00:05:45,480
will be Young Master Wangquan.

48
00:05:45,909 --> 00:05:48,010
He's a conniving man.

49
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:50,790
You'd better disguise as a sword attendant

50
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:52,310
and stay cautious.

51
00:05:54,620 --> 00:05:55,850
Masters,

52
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:58,200
I, Nangong Ye, am truly honored

53
00:05:58,390 --> 00:06:00,360
to witness with you

54
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:02,190
the unveiling of the Celestial Demon Divine Sword.

55
00:06:02,190 --> 00:06:03,600
I am sure

56
00:06:03,830 --> 00:06:05,630
this will reveal a turning point

57
00:06:05,750 --> 00:06:09,350
for the long-standing conflict between humans and demons.

58
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:10,630
Come on.

59
00:06:10,630 --> 00:06:13,200
Let's toast to the unity of Yiqi Alliance.

60
00:06:13,770 --> 00:06:16,890
To the unity of Yiqi Alliance.

61
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:21,860
Before the sword is brought to light,

62
00:06:22,270 --> 00:06:23,630
I'd like you to enjoy

63
00:06:24,090 --> 00:06:26,350
a little performance I prepared for you.

64
00:06:48,740 --> 00:06:50,490
[Flood Dragon Demon from Southern Ocean]

65
00:06:49,060 --> 00:06:52,680
This demon has cultivated for a thousand years.

66
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:54,560
A sword made with its demon core

67
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:56,560
can control all waters in the world.

68
00:06:57,530 --> 00:06:59,280
[Niuyang Turtle]

69
00:06:58,630 --> 00:07:01,560
This turtle has cultivated for 800 years.

70
00:07:02,270 --> 00:07:04,000
A sword made with its demon core

71
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
is impervious to any kind of poison.

72
00:07:07,450 --> 00:07:08,630
[Fiery Kylin]

73
00:07:07,510 --> 00:07:10,040
There is a fiery kylin and a wind kylin.

74
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:10,150
[Wind Kylin]

75
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:11,640
They're the kings of beasts.

76
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:13,970
A sword made with their demon cores

77
00:07:14,570 --> 00:07:16,160
can tame wind and resist fire.

78
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:18,220
Even blades and spears can't hurt it.

79
00:08:03,730 --> 00:08:06,590
Master Nangong, the cores await your examination.

80
00:08:16,570 --> 00:08:18,120
Masters, I humbly

81
00:08:18,180 --> 00:08:19,510
offer these four swords

82
00:08:19,530 --> 00:08:21,410
to you as gifts.

83
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:25,070
It's very generous of you, Master Nangong.

84
00:08:25,070 --> 00:08:26,830
The Cheng family would like one sword.

85
00:08:26,830 --> 00:08:28,630
The Gu family will take one as well.

86
00:08:28,630 --> 00:08:29,680
So will the Han family.

87
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:31,340
The Zhou family wants one too.

88
00:08:34,110 --> 00:08:35,440
Young Master Wangquan,

89
00:08:36,390 --> 00:08:37,789
are you interested

90
00:08:37,789 --> 00:08:39,630
in getting one of such swords?

91
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:42,400
It's kind of you to ask, Master Nangong.

92
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:44,500
I already have Wangquan Sword.

93
00:08:46,130 --> 00:08:47,130
It's all I need.

94
00:10:39,020 --> 00:10:40,480
What kind of power is this?

95
00:10:40,850 --> 00:10:42,450
Why does it feel so familiar?

96
00:10:42,990 --> 00:10:44,260
Could it be...

97
00:10:53,330 --> 00:10:54,660
Young Master Wangquan.

98
00:10:57,360 --> 00:10:58,470
Master Nangong,

99
00:10:59,790 --> 00:11:00,910
the music and the dance

100
00:11:00,910 --> 00:11:02,120
were both amazing.

101
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:03,870
I was held spellbound.

102
00:11:07,270 --> 00:11:08,080
Huaizhu,

103
00:11:09,260 --> 00:11:10,750
get ready

104
00:11:10,890 --> 00:11:14,760
to serve Young Master Wangquan in the guest house.

105
00:11:15,580 --> 00:11:18,040
Make sure you try your best to please him.

106
00:11:36,140 --> 00:11:38,000
Has he fallen for our trick or not?

107
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:40,860
There is no way to tell. Why?

108
00:11:42,530 --> 00:11:44,590
So this is your trap, Master Nangong.

109
00:11:47,530 --> 00:11:48,820
In your opinion,

110
00:11:49,570 --> 00:11:52,250
has Wangquan Hongye been inflicted yet?

111
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:55,470
Young Master Wangquan looks calm and composed.

112
00:11:56,030 --> 00:11:58,120
I suggest we probe deeper into it.

113
00:11:58,810 --> 00:11:59,580
Sounds good.

114
00:12:00,500 --> 00:12:03,480
Please observe closely when you are with him.

115
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:06,000
Tomorrow, at the sword unveiling ceremony,

116
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,530
we'll join hands to reach our ambitious goal.

117
00:12:40,750 --> 00:12:42,870
Nangong family's first attempt failed.

118
00:12:42,870 --> 00:12:44,470
They must have a backup plan.

119
00:12:50,550 --> 00:12:51,880
Young Master Wangquan,

120
00:12:52,790 --> 00:12:55,550
I'm Nangong Zhu, a sword attendant for you.

121
00:12:56,500 --> 00:12:57,310
Come in.

122
00:13:03,270 --> 00:13:04,530
I bet their backup plan

123
00:13:04,840 --> 00:13:06,700
is executed by Dongfang Huaizhu.

124
00:13:07,550 --> 00:13:09,410
I can't let her collude with them.

125
00:13:19,390 --> 00:13:21,120
How is your bath, Young Master?

126
00:13:21,560 --> 00:13:23,080
Is my service needed?

127
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:24,760
No.

128
00:13:25,210 --> 00:13:28,160
You sound tired.

129
00:13:28,220 --> 00:13:30,070
Are you feeling discomfort?

130
00:13:30,610 --> 00:13:32,430
I'm equipped with medical skills.

131
00:13:32,430 --> 00:13:34,230
I can take your pulse if you want.

132
00:13:36,030 --> 00:13:36,970
It's late.

133
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:38,760
The water is a bit cold.

134
00:13:39,840 --> 00:13:42,030
Perhaps the water is not cold.

135
00:13:42,180 --> 00:13:45,060
Maybe you feel cold because you are ill.

136
00:13:51,750 --> 00:13:54,640
Since you are a sword attendant,

137
00:13:55,150 --> 00:13:58,800
you should know good swords choose competent owners,

138
00:13:59,240 --> 00:14:02,100
and that chess pieces are at the players' disposal.

139
00:14:02,270 --> 00:14:04,040
In your eyes,

140
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:05,990
am I a sword

141
00:14:06,630 --> 00:14:07,870
or a chess piece?

142
00:14:08,630 --> 00:14:09,870
That depends on you.

143
00:14:10,380 --> 00:14:11,980
Nangong Ye is not the only one

144
00:14:13,130 --> 00:14:14,860
that can give you what you want.

145
00:14:15,670 --> 00:14:16,590
However...

146
00:14:17,720 --> 00:14:19,320
The decisive factor here

147
00:14:20,540 --> 00:14:22,340
is how much value you have.

148
00:14:22,870 --> 00:14:27,310
Young master, is this a debate about chess?

149
00:14:28,550 --> 00:14:31,980
It's a shame that I'm not proficient in any forms of art.

150
00:14:32,390 --> 00:14:34,850
You take a bamboo flute with you everywhere.

151
00:14:35,270 --> 00:14:36,270
But it turns out

152
00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:38,600
just to be an ornament.

153
00:14:49,220 --> 00:14:53,260
I wonder when you can't bear the pain brought by the injuries.

154
00:15:31,840 --> 00:15:33,500
You're not a sword attendant.

155
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:35,640
What exactly do you want?

156
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:37,960
That doesn't matter.

157
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:39,860
The important thing is

158
00:15:40,660 --> 00:15:42,210
that you are injured.

159
00:15:42,690 --> 00:15:45,000
You will soon collapse.

160
00:15:46,960 --> 00:15:47,790
That is

161
00:15:48,870 --> 00:15:50,600
an alarmists remark, isn't it?

162
00:15:52,550 --> 00:15:54,960
These are Jiaye Bells.

163
00:15:56,080 --> 00:15:59,280
Apparently, Nangong family set up Bell Sound Formations

164
00:15:59,510 --> 00:16:02,670
to welcome you at the dinner party.

165
00:16:03,630 --> 00:16:04,750
These formations

166
00:16:04,750 --> 00:16:06,510
would gradually deprive you

167
00:16:07,080 --> 00:16:08,410
of all your five senses,

168
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:11,200
except your sense of touch.

169
00:16:13,510 --> 00:16:15,770
First, it'd take away the sense of taste.

170
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,400
Then, the sense of smell.

171
00:16:21,550 --> 00:16:22,670
But now,

172
00:16:24,150 --> 00:16:25,390
I'm feeling fine.

173
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:30,440
Young Master,

174
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:32,390
smell this.

175
00:16:43,390 --> 00:16:44,650
No floral scent at all.

176
00:16:48,190 --> 00:16:49,250
What did you smell?

177
00:16:49,520 --> 00:16:51,780
Was there a lingering floral fragrance?

178
00:16:53,460 --> 00:16:54,790
I don't feel threatened

179
00:16:55,880 --> 00:16:57,210
by such minor injuries.

180
00:16:57,270 --> 00:16:59,910
Okay. Let me give it a try.

181
00:17:52,270 --> 00:17:53,870
Under these circumstances,

182
00:17:54,090 --> 00:17:56,310
you're still able to hold your sword tight.

183
00:17:56,310 --> 00:17:57,510
How admirable.

184
00:18:09,100 --> 00:18:11,030
Senior, there is a sound over there.

185
00:18:11,030 --> 00:18:12,360
Let's wait and observe.

186
00:18:16,030 --> 00:18:18,590
As I expected, you pretended to be fine
in order to protect yourself

187
00:18:18,590 --> 00:18:19,990
from the Nangong family.

188
00:18:20,030 --> 00:18:21,420
Now that you know it,

189
00:18:22,310 --> 00:18:24,470

He never says anything nice.

It's time to stop.

Besides, your mind control technique

Why don't you take a guess, Young Master?

00:25:58,070 --> 00:25:59,980
I guess you're not a sword attendant,

274
00:25:59,980 --> 00:26:02,910
but someone hired by Nangong Ye to hurt me.

275
00:26:03,960 --> 00:26:05,110
Knowing you would be up against me

276
00:26:05,110 --> 00:26:07,370
didn't stop you from taking on this task.

277
00:26:07,370 --> 00:26:10,330
There must be something extraordinary about you.

278
00:26:13,620 --> 00:26:15,580
So, Young Master, do you think

279
00:26:16,070 --> 00:26:17,670
I'm here to assassinate you?

280
00:26:17,750 --> 00:26:18,920
I believe

that a smart

282

and composed person like you

283
00:26:23,540 --> 00:26:25,000
can tell right from wrong

284
00:26:25,270 --> 00:26:28,240
and avoid being Nangong Ye's killing tool.

As you said,

Nangong Ye has set a Mystical Bell Formation outside the sword furnace.

Once it is activated, no one can break through.

The color of these maple leaves seems odd.

330

It's because the demons whose cores were taken out

00:33:34,590 --> 00:33:36,940
my mom would come back.

377
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:42,550
Who said that to you?

378
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:44,200
Was it Nangong Ye?

379
00:33:50,810 --> 00:33:51,830
Over there!

380
00:33:52,570 --> 00:33:53,460
Be careful!

381
00:33:56,750 --> 00:33:57,440
This way!

382
00:34:06,200 --> 00:34:07,910
Shoot the little one!

383
00:34:08,190 --> 00:34:09,590
When the little one is down,

384
00:34:09,590 --> 00:34:11,330
the older one can't escape.

385
00:34:14,580 --> 00:34:15,510
Nan!

386
00:34:15,840 --> 00:34:16,630
Run!

387
00:34:17,620 --> 00:34:19,000
Mom, run!

388
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:20,929
Come back to rescue me when you can!

389
00:34:30,400 --> 00:34:32,600
Young Master, the older one got away.

390
00:34:32,770 --> 00:34:34,429
She's at the demon king level.

391
00:34:35,170 --> 00:34:37,150
There's something you don't know.

392
00:34:37,870 --> 00:34:39,610
A demon's motherhood

393
00:34:40,030 --> 00:34:43,000
can be as strong as a human's.

394
00:34:43,710 --> 00:34:45,840
She won't go away.

395
00:35:06,660 --> 00:35:09,150
[Bifang Bird Demon]
[Nan's Mother]

396
00:35:07,070 --> 00:35:08,070
Release Nan.

397
00:35:10,030 --> 00:35:11,190
I'll go with you.

398
00:35:18,130 --> 00:35:19,260
Mom...

399
00:35:20,110 --> 00:35:21,360
Where is my mom?

400
00:35:28,040 --> 00:35:29,160
Your name is Nan?

401
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:33,030
Is there demon fire

402
00:35:33,590 --> 00:35:35,790
in every member of the Divine Bird Clan?

403
00:35:39,680 --> 00:35:40,870
Listen,

404
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:41,950
Nan,

405
00:35:41,980 --> 00:35:45,180
I just need to borrow your mom's demon core to make a sword.

406
00:35:45,190 --> 00:35:48,510
Demon cores can regenerate.

407
00:35:49,230 --> 00:35:50,920
Your mom is recuperating.

408
00:35:51,630 --> 00:35:54,110
If you help me finish making the sword,

409
00:35:54,590 --> 00:35:56,800
I will let you and your mom reunite.

410
00:35:57,980 --> 00:35:58,830
Okay?

411
00:36:01,180 --> 00:36:02,650
How could a demon live

412
00:36:03,230 --> 00:36:04,670
without its demon core?

413
00:36:05,030 --> 00:36:06,510
He lied to a kid,

414
00:36:06,930 --> 00:36:08,320
and tricked the kid into using

415
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:11,250
her demon fire to refine her own mother's demon core.

416
00:36:11,360 --> 00:36:12,560
Nangong Ye,

417
00:36:13,360 --> 00:36:15,690
you must redeem your sins with your blood!

418
00:36:17,230 --> 00:36:19,510
The forging process is coming to an end.

419
00:36:19,670 --> 00:36:22,940
I will see my mother again soon.

420
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:26,000
He lied to you.

421
00:36:28,360 --> 00:36:29,320
Demon cores

422
00:36:29,840 --> 00:36:31,320
cannot regenerate.

423
00:36:33,780 --> 00:36:35,130
Your mother...

424
00:36:37,230 --> 00:36:38,320
is already dead.

425
00:36:41,110 --> 00:36:42,550
You're lying to me.

426
00:36:43,800 --> 00:36:46,840
I'll help you out of these talismans, okay?

427
00:37:11,810 --> 00:37:14,210
I'll destroy the sword furnace right away.

428
00:37:38,070 --> 00:37:40,510
You can't take her away now.

429
00:37:41,660 --> 00:37:44,860
Bifang bird demons burn their lives in exchange for fire.

430
00:37:45,070 --> 00:37:46,520
When the demon sword is formed,

431
00:37:46,520 --> 00:37:47,760
she'll die.

432
00:37:47,960 --> 00:37:49,710
The furnace fire must not be put out.

433
00:37:49,710 --> 00:37:51,670
The demon sword must be formed.

434
00:37:55,110 --> 00:37:57,150
I know how you're feeling now.

435
00:37:58,750 --> 00:38:00,010
But I have to reiterate

436
00:38:00,320 --> 00:38:01,920
that the fire must not be put out,

437
00:38:01,920 --> 00:38:03,850
and the demon sword must be formed.

438
00:38:03,870 --> 00:38:06,690
Otherwise, my plan will be ruined.

439
00:38:08,320 --> 00:38:11,180
How could you let them make a sword with demon cores?

440
00:38:11,230 --> 00:38:12,450
Wangquan Hongye,

441
00:38:12,790 --> 00:38:14,720
you're as evil as the Nangong family!

442
00:38:14,720 --> 00:38:15,920
Dongfang Huaizhu!

443
00:38:21,550 --> 00:38:22,750
You can recognize me?

444
00:38:25,490 --> 00:38:27,420
I don't want to give you a hard time.

445
00:38:28,310 --> 00:38:30,280
Please trust me one more time.

446
00:38:30,630 --> 00:38:32,230
I'll explain it to you later.

447
00:38:33,270 --> 00:38:34,910
Who's in there?

448
00:38:34,930 --> 00:38:37,930
How dare you trespass on these forbidden grounds.

449
00:38:37,960 --> 00:38:39,690
Come out now. I'll kill you!

450
00:38:50,070 --> 00:38:51,360
Why should I trust you?

451
00:38:54,670 --> 00:38:57,000
You are the one holding the chess piece now.

452
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:58,440
As for where to place it,

453
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:02,000
just follow your intuition.
