you can kill her?

78
00:05:37,460 --> 00:05:38,950

79
00:05:38,950 --> 00:05:40,800

80
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:41,680
we can do it.

00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:45,750
You've seen your own ending.

What if it can't be changed?

85
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:57,120
We'll never know unless we try.

86
00:06:05,310 --> 00:06:08,630
Your Twilight Mist Flower
has sealed the Black Fox's soul shard

87
00:06:08,630 --> 00:06:10,560
and purified many vengeful spirits.

88
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:11,760
It's pure, powerful—

89
00:06:12,190 --> 00:06:13,830
indeed the Black Fox's nemesis.

90
00:06:13,830 --> 00:06:16,290
Then how should I
use it beyond the Boundary?

91
00:06:20,430 --> 00:06:23,270
Your power can be used on the Grief Tree.

92
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:25,600
Now that the Trees are connected,

93
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:27,390
you can use the Twilight Mist Flower

94
00:06:27,390 --> 00:06:29,590
to draw power from the Black Grief Tree.

95
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:33,040
It's the source
of the Black Fox's demonic energy.

96
00:06:34,190 --> 00:06:35,270
I can do it now.

97
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:36,510
-No.
-No.

98
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:37,800
If you start now,

99
00:06:38,070 --> 00:06:39,530
the Black Fox will notice.

100
00:06:39,540 --> 00:06:41,400
She's far more powerful than you.

101
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:45,659
So the best solution is
that when he crosses the Boundary,

102
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:46,850
you stay inside.

103
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,040
You can attack from both sides,

104
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:49,170
catch her off guard,

105
00:06:49,190 --> 00:06:50,390
and then take her out.

106
00:06:52,890 --> 00:06:54,460
But the cruel part is—

107
00:06:54,630 --> 00:06:57,490
you won't be able
to go beyond the Boundary with him.

My Lord.

167
00:11:40,150 --> 00:11:44,270
What kind of demon sword
can be forged with a celestial demon's core?

168
00:11:58,690 --> 00:12:00,220
The celestial demon Jiuhuo

169
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:04,320
is said to be the strongest demon
across heaven and earth in 1,000 years.

170

But it turns out you're not that strong.

Who do you think you are

172
00:12:09,370 --> 00:12:12,840

Your spine is broken.

Jiuhuo at his peak

185
00:13:53,750 --> 00:13:55,440
could have killed me…

186
00:13:59,370 --> 00:14:01,100
with a mere flick of his finger.

187
00:14:01,750 --> 00:14:03,150

00:14:03,150 --> 00:14:05,840
the two Grief Trees
inside and outside the Boundary.

189
00:14:05,840 --> 00:14:07,690
Your demonic energy is depleted.

190
00:14:07,690 --> 00:14:09,100
You're done for.

191
00:14:10,710 --> 00:14:12,260
Do you want to know

192
00:14:13,080 --> 00:14:14,750
how I knew you were finished…

193
00:14:16,090 --> 00:14:17,860
or how I knew

194
00:14:18,470 --> 00:14:20,530
dragon blood is lethal to you?

195
00:14:31,780 --> 00:14:33,000
Impossible.

196
00:14:35,380 --> 00:14:36,850
Lady Black Fox.

197
00:14:37,830 --> 00:14:40,230
If you don't come out and explain yourself,

198
00:14:40,390 --> 00:14:43,630
I'm afraid I won't
be able to serve you any longer.

199
00:14:45,030 --> 00:14:46,640
Lord Jiuhuo.

200
00:14:46,840 --> 00:14:49,180
I know you miss Jia Lan very much.

201
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:51,960
I'll let you see her one last time.

202
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:08,440
Jia Lan.

203
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:17,800
Jin Renfeng.

204
00:15:18,910 --> 00:15:20,150
How could you do this?

205
00:15:24,010 --> 00:15:25,750
This is the only demon…

206
00:15:27,790 --> 00:15:29,750
I care about.

207
00:15:30,750 --> 00:15:31,670
Lady Black Fox.

208
00:15:32,360 --> 00:15:34,030
When forging a sword with a demon core,

209
00:15:34,030 --> 00:15:35,670
the stronger the resentment,

210
00:15:35,670 --> 00:15:36,930
the better the result.

211
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:39,460
You want to carve out my demon core

212
00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:42,080
to forge a sword?

213
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:43,150
Yes.

214
00:15:44,790 --> 00:15:45,670
Indeed.

215
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:53,050
It's taking you so long
to recover from your broken spine.

216
00:15:54,030 --> 00:15:56,410
Looks like your demonic power is depleted.

217
00:15:56,410 --> 00:15:57,870
You're useless now.

218
00:16:02,020 --> 00:16:03,730
You're not Jia Lan.

219
00:16:07,150 --> 00:16:08,440
Lord Jiuhuo, am I not

220
00:16:08,440 --> 00:16:10,640
the little fox you've been longing for?

221
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:15,240
Look at you,

222
00:16:17,520 --> 00:16:20,320
bearing a wound
that will never heal because of me.

223
00:16:21,390 --> 00:16:22,920
It's truly heartbreaking.

224
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:26,380
For me, you sacrificed

225
00:16:26,550 --> 00:16:29,000
your demon core to repair the Golden Dawn

226
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:31,490
and traveled back in time at all costs.

227
00:16:32,360 --> 00:16:33,870
You even depleted your demonic energy

228
00:16:33,870 --> 00:16:35,600
to connect the two Grief Trees.

229
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:39,550
Lord Jiuhuo, you really would

230
00:16:40,360 --> 00:16:42,090
give up everything for Jia Lan.

231
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:46,790
But she's already dead.

232
00:16:49,270 --> 00:16:50,390
I was born from

233
00:16:50,390 --> 00:16:53,450
the endless resentment
that gathered after her death.

234
00:16:53,630 --> 00:16:54,840
I'm someone new.

235
00:16:57,270 --> 00:16:58,360
Impossible.

236
00:17:00,030 --> 00:17:02,030
I can definitely bring her back.

237
00:17:12,829 --> 00:17:13,960
All these years,

238
00:17:15,599 --> 00:17:17,430
I've been thinking—

239
00:17:17,829 --> 00:17:19,890
you and I were both celestial demons.

240
00:17:20,030 --> 00:17:21,640
If we had joined forces,

241
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:23,890
we could've been unstoppable.

242
00:17:24,440 --> 00:17:26,400
So where did it all go wrong?

243
00:17:28,550 --> 00:17:29,810
Do you know the answer?

244
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:33,450
It was because we loved each other.

245
00:17:34,350 --> 00:17:36,180
Love was our greatest weakness

246
00:17:36,270 --> 00:17:37,680
and our only weakness.

247
00:17:38,270 --> 00:17:39,510
It must be abandoned.

248
00:17:42,730 --> 00:17:44,110
Are you insane?

249
00:17:45,340 --> 00:17:46,870
I feel the pain too.

250
00:17:48,950 --> 00:17:51,440
But each time it hurts,
it's like a reminder—

251
00:17:52,070 --> 00:17:53,640
my weakness is still there.

252
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:55,370
That's her heart.

253
00:17:56,680 --> 00:17:57,980
She's still hurting.

254
00:17:58,440 --> 00:17:59,970
As long as she can come back,

255
00:18:00,110 --> 00:18:01,790
I'm willing to do anything.

256
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:05,960
Jia Lan.

257
00:18:06,980 --> 00:18:08,720
I know you're still there.

258
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:11,370
I'll definitely bring you back.

259
00:18:11,720 --> 00:18:13,160
We can still be together.

260
00:18:13,350 --> 00:18:14,790
She's already dead.

261
00:18:17,270 --> 00:18:19,160
I'm wearing her face now.

262
00:18:19,680 --> 00:18:21,410
Don't you have feelings for me?

263
00:18:23,830 --> 00:18:25,920
What exactly do you want to do?

264
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:28,880
I want the whole world to die with us.

265
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:33,600
I want every shred of love
in this world to vanish forever.

266
00:18:36,920 --> 00:18:38,070
You're delusional.

267
00:18:48,350 --> 00:18:49,510
Lord Jiuhuo.

268
00:18:50,440 --> 00:18:52,300
You know I only admire the strong.

269
00:18:53,160 --> 00:18:54,880
You're worthless now.

270
00:18:55,510 --> 00:18:57,440
Why not offer your demon core to me?

271
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:01,210
At least then, I'll remember you loved me.

272
00:19:03,110 --> 00:19:04,740
You madwoman!

273
00:19:09,300 --> 00:19:11,500
I know you're immortal,

274
00:19:11,750 --> 00:19:13,880
but with your demonic energy depleted,

275
00:19:13,880 --> 00:19:16,470
your demon core should be fully refined

276
00:19:16,790 --> 00:19:18,850
within a month in that sword furnace.

277
00:19:23,620 --> 00:19:26,070
Give me back my Jia Lan!

278
00:19:32,790 --> 00:19:33,990
Take a good look at me.

279
00:19:35,020 --> 00:19:36,390
Who am I?

280
00:19:44,270 --> 00:19:45,270
My Lord,

281
00:19:45,920 --> 00:19:46,960
a butterfly

282
00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:50,160
should die at its most beautiful moment,

283
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:51,970
don't you think?

284
00:19:58,590 --> 00:19:59,440
Jin Renfeng,

285
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:01,860
I'll leave the rest to you.

286
00:21:11,270 --> 00:21:13,000
Wangquan Hongye.

287
00:21:29,950 --> 00:21:33,460
You think you can carve out my demon core?

288
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:43,160
Jin Renfeng,

289
00:21:44,160 --> 00:21:46,720
you clearly don't understand

290
00:21:47,720 --> 00:21:49,830
what it means to be a celestial demon.

291
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:54,410
I'm Lord Jiuhuo.
I defeated the entire Dragon Clan

292
00:21:54,680 --> 00:21:56,740
on my own.

293
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:04,570
I've always been proud and solitary.

294
00:22:05,160 --> 00:22:08,550
I never deigned to absorb others'
demonic energy or spiritual energy.

295
00:22:08,550 --> 00:22:09,880
But that doesn't mean

296
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:12,710
I can't.

297
00:22:22,550 --> 00:22:24,350
Wangquan Hongye.

298
00:22:26,630 --> 00:22:28,580
You've come at the right time.

299
00:23:44,920 --> 00:23:45,790
Jiuhuo.

300
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:48,930
Such powerful demonic energy.

301
00:23:53,160 --> 00:23:53,960
Hongye!

302
00:23:57,070 --> 00:23:58,790
Wangquan Hongye.

303
00:24:00,110 --> 00:24:03,810
What grudge do you hold against me?

304
00:24:04,030 --> 00:24:06,110
You've ruined my plans again and again.

305
00:24:06,110 --> 00:24:07,670
If not for you,

306
00:24:07,750 --> 00:24:11,630
my Jia Lan would've returned long ago.

307
00:24:15,510 --> 00:24:16,350
Jiuhuo.

308
00:24:17,230 --> 00:24:21,030
Your demonic power is spent.
Why keep struggling?

309
00:24:21,390 --> 00:24:23,950
I know my time is almost up.

310
00:24:24,110 --> 00:24:26,590
Absorbing the spiritual energy
of those weaklings

311
00:24:26,590 --> 00:24:28,720
would only hasten my death.

312
00:24:28,920 --> 00:24:29,830
But in this world,

313
00:24:29,830 --> 00:24:32,750
there's nothing left for me to cling to.

314
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:35,100
You say you fight for justice,

315
00:24:35,780 --> 00:24:39,980
but do you understand
the bitterness of being set up by someone despicable,

316
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:43,040
the pain
of watching your loved one die before you,

317
00:24:43,160 --> 00:24:45,820
the darkness
of being sealed away for 500 years,

318
00:24:47,550 --> 00:24:50,550
and the despair
of being betrayed by the one you loved?

319
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:53,890
I've never seen light in my life.

320
00:24:54,070 --> 00:24:56,670
So I'll drag you all down with me!

321
00:25:05,310 --> 00:25:07,120
Wangquan Hongye,

322
00:25:07,270 --> 00:25:10,030
I'll wipe you from existence…

323
00:25:12,140 --> 00:25:14,380
and make your Huaizhu taste

324
00:25:15,490 --> 00:25:18,110
the pain of losing a loved one!

325
00:25:27,860 --> 00:25:31,730
I, Jiuhuo, willingly reduce myself to dust,

326
00:25:32,030 --> 00:25:34,160
summon thunder from the Nine Heavens,

327
00:25:34,460 --> 00:25:37,920
and curse every trace
of love and light in this world—

328
00:25:37,920 --> 00:25:39,450
let it all be extinguished.

329
00:25:39,510 --> 00:25:41,070
Wangquan Hongye,

330
00:25:42,110 --> 00:25:43,960
let's perish together!

331
00:25:45,510 --> 00:25:47,200
You sure

332
00:25:48,350 --> 00:25:49,680
talk a lot today.

333
00:25:51,850 --> 00:25:53,360
You've lost everything

334
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:57,640
because you're narrow-minded, obsessed,

335
00:25:58,350 --> 00:26:00,680
and treat all living beings like insects.

336
00:26:15,540 --> 00:26:17,740
The love and light in this world…

337
00:26:18,790 --> 00:26:20,790
will never be extinguished.

338
00:26:21,430 --> 00:26:27,120
Unparalleled Sword!

339
00:26:49,800 --> 00:26:50,670
Jiuhuo.

340
00:26:50,900 --> 00:26:52,480
Your demonic energy is depleted,

341
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:54,550
and you've been struck
by the Unparalleled Sword.

342
00:26:54,550 --> 00:26:56,080
You're no longer immortal.

343
00:27:08,270 --> 00:27:10,350
My Jia Lan is dead.

344
00:27:11,680 --> 00:27:14,440
Do you think
I still care about life or death?

345
00:27:26,550 --> 00:27:28,590
I came into this world

346
00:27:30,550 --> 00:27:32,880
to walk my own path

347
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:36,270
and do what I want to do,

348
00:27:37,960 --> 00:27:39,960
unbound by anything.

349
00:27:41,880 --> 00:27:43,810
There were moments of brilliance…

350
00:27:46,440 --> 00:27:48,790
and also moments of darkness.

351
00:27:51,030 --> 00:27:52,790
I admit my mistakes…

352
00:27:56,030 --> 00:27:57,750
but I have no regrets.

353
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:02,030
Wangquan Hongye,

354
00:28:03,310 --> 00:28:05,790
if your Unparalleled Sword can kill me,

355
00:28:07,510 --> 00:28:09,680
it might be able to kill the Black Fox.

356
00:28:12,440 --> 00:28:14,030
That's good.

357
00:28:16,400 --> 00:28:18,160
Kill her for me…

358
00:28:21,960 --> 00:28:23,310

I feel for them.

00:29:49,630 --> 00:29:51,880
♪ And falling ♪

392
00:29:51,830 --> 00:29:55,270
those who've suffered malice repeatedly,
whether human or demon,

393
00:29:55,270 --> 00:29:56,790
can never be kind again.

394
00:29:59,920 --> 00:30:02,980
So the fact that we still live
in the world and not in hell

395
00:30:03,180 --> 00:30:04,770
is because there are still

396
00:30:05,160 --> 00:30:06,790
kind humans and demons.

397
00:30:07,750 --> 00:30:09,030
Then, may they both…

398
00:30:10,350 --> 00:30:11,750
be reborn as someone else

399
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:14,200
and live a simple life.

400
00:31:01,110 --> 00:31:02,030
Renfeng.

401
00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:04,000
Who injured you?

402
00:31:09,720 --> 00:31:11,780
It's okay if you don't want to answer.

403
00:31:12,790 --> 00:31:14,240
I'll always be here.

404
00:31:16,350 --> 00:31:17,240
Tan.

405
00:31:19,310 --> 00:31:21,170
What on earth do you like about me?

406
00:31:23,110 --> 00:31:24,710
I like that you're strong

407
00:31:24,790 --> 00:31:25,790
and domineering.

408
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:28,970
In the Leech Clan, females reign supreme.

409
00:31:29,590 --> 00:31:31,400
My father and all my brothers

410
00:31:31,640 --> 00:31:34,000
are spineless cowards.

411
00:31:36,830 --> 00:31:37,750
Domineering?

412
00:31:38,830 --> 00:31:40,290
Without Spiritual Blood,

413
00:31:41,070 --> 00:31:43,030
I'm nothing.

414
00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:46,450
Just someone for them to bully.

415
00:31:53,720 --> 00:31:54,590
Tan.

416
00:31:55,350 --> 00:31:56,270
You said

417
00:31:57,510 --> 00:32:00,790
there's one last secret
to the blood-changing technique.

418
00:32:01,510 --> 00:32:03,070
If I learn it,

419
00:32:03,790 --> 00:32:05,590
can I exchange Spiritual Blood?

420
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:10,000
Renfeng,

421
00:32:11,160 --> 00:32:13,710
I can't tell you the last secret.

422
00:32:14,070 --> 00:32:15,590
If my master finds out,

423
00:32:15,750 --> 00:32:17,400
she'll never let us go.

424
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:24,730
Then don't let her find out.

425
00:32:25,270 --> 00:32:27,110
But I swore an oath to her.

426
00:32:27,960 --> 00:32:29,070
If I break it,

427
00:32:29,750 --> 00:32:31,080
I'll never be forgiven.

428
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:38,170
So I mean so little to you after all.

429
00:32:39,960 --> 00:32:40,760
You may leave.

430
00:32:43,510 --> 00:32:44,270
Renfeng.

431
00:32:46,270 --> 00:32:46,960
Alright.

432
00:32:47,830 --> 00:32:48,960
I'll help you.

433
00:32:49,880 --> 00:32:51,430
But only if you promise

434
00:32:52,200 --> 00:32:53,680
to kill Dongfang Huaizhu.

435
00:32:55,440 --> 00:32:58,160
From now on,
I'm the only woman in your heart.

436
00:33:06,270 --> 00:33:07,160
Fine.

437
00:33:07,960 --> 00:33:09,030
I promise you.

438
00:33:34,270 --> 00:33:35,070
Tan,

439
00:33:37,290 --> 00:33:38,920
you taught me the last secret

440
00:33:38,920 --> 00:33:40,850
of the blood-changing technique.

441
00:33:41,850 --> 00:33:43,600
I'll remember it for life.

442
00:33:45,450 --> 00:33:47,380
Too bad you'll never see it.

443
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:02,060
You were the only woman

444
00:34:02,680 --> 00:34:04,800
in this world who truly loved me.

445
00:34:07,110 --> 00:34:09,610
But if I, Jin Renfeng, were a good man,

446
00:34:12,630 --> 00:34:14,880
I wouldn't have made it this far.
