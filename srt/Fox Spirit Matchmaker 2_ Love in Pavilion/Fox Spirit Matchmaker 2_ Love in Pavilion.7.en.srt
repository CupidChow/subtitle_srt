[Li Family's Dye Workshop]

4
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:12,630
After you leave,

5
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:16,120
be sure to be a good demon.

6
00:02:28,630 --> 00:02:29,840
Xiaowu,

7
00:02:31,430 --> 00:02:32,930
I killed someone.

8
00:02:34,310 --> 00:02:36,310
I'm not a good demon anymore.

9
00:02:37,150 --> 00:02:38,470
What should I do?

10
00:02:38,750 --> 00:02:40,680
A life for a life.

11
00:02:41,030 --> 00:02:43,160
What else can you do?

12
00:02:48,310 --> 00:02:49,150
Little demon,

13
00:02:50,150 --> 00:02:52,400
you've made it hard for me to find you.

14
00:03:02,430 --> 00:03:03,520
Hiding, are you?

15
00:03:03,870 --> 00:03:05,030
Not coming out, huh?

16
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:07,490
Then let me ask you a question.

17
00:03:07,810 --> 00:03:10,630
This benefactor you keep talking about,

18
00:03:11,630 --> 00:03:14,240
is his name Mu Renzhi?

19
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,230
Oh no.

20
00:03:17,079 --> 00:03:18,150
Not answering?

21
00:03:18,630 --> 00:03:20,000
Then I'll go back now

22
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,430
and dismember your so-called benefactor's

23
00:03:22,430 --> 00:03:24,590
hands, arms,

24
00:03:26,030 --> 00:03:27,520
and legs!

25
00:03:45,910 --> 00:03:46,590
You...

26
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:49,520
What have you done to Xiaowu?

27
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:51,579
What's have I done?

28
00:03:52,079 --> 00:03:54,060
He's at the Inspection Bureau now.

29
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:55,750
If you want him to live,

30
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:57,590
obediently hand over the demon-controlling talisman

31
00:03:57,590 --> 00:03:58,630
you stole.

32
00:04:09,610 --> 00:04:10,470
Sir.

33
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:46,460
Little demon,

34
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:50,050
I'm giving you a chance to take your own life out of guilt.

35
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:55,120
What's wrong?

36
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:58,140
Can't bear to hurt yourself?

37
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:02,190
Pick it up.

38
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:11,190
Stab yourself.

39
00:05:24,270 --> 00:05:26,430
Come on, stab!

40
00:05:44,870 --> 00:05:46,070
Young Master Wangquan,

41
00:05:46,070 --> 00:05:47,510
we are carrying out our official duty

42
00:05:47,510 --> 00:05:49,110
to arrest a murderous demon.

43
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:50,840
We'll take this person back.

44
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:52,020
You may withdraw.

45
00:05:52,020 --> 00:05:53,000
Young Master,

46
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:55,310
the Inspection Bureau has always been independent of the Yiqi Alliance.

47
00:05:55,310 --> 00:05:56,750
I'm afraid

48
00:05:56,920 --> 00:05:58,780
your actions are inappropriate.

49
00:06:05,510 --> 00:06:06,270
Very well.

50
00:06:07,570 --> 00:06:09,700
I will obey the Young Master's orders.

51
00:06:09,950 --> 00:06:11,550
You may take the person away.

52
00:06:14,330 --> 00:06:16,660
Stab that woman in front.

53
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:26,420
What are you doing?

54
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:28,310
I didn't mean to.

55
00:06:28,510 --> 00:06:31,240
I'm controlled by the demon-controlling talisman.

56
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:32,560
Lowly demon,

57
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:34,010
die!

58
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:46,659
Just you wait!

59
00:06:48,870 --> 00:06:51,120
You spent tens of thousands of my silver

60
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:54,500
and only bought these demon-controlling talismans?

61
00:06:54,500 --> 00:06:56,360
Liuyun Pavilion has been under tight surveillance lately.

62
00:06:56,360 --> 00:06:59,020
Getting these is already quite an achievement.

63
00:06:59,290 --> 00:07:04,150
With a demon-controlling talisman, one can activate it

64
00:07:04,510 --> 00:07:06,830
and force demons to do anything.

65
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:08,360
If a demon resists,

66
00:07:08,430 --> 00:07:10,670
the talisman can be burned,

67
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:13,550
and the demon will self-immolate.

68
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:17,510
Isn't the person who made this

69
00:07:18,550 --> 00:07:20,520
a genius?

70
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:25,160
Countless noble families secretly use demon-controlling talismans.

71
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:27,510
Only the Wangquan family fails to recognize their value,

72
00:07:27,510 --> 00:07:29,250
clinging to the position of Alliance Leader

73
00:07:29,250 --> 00:07:31,750
and constantly banning demon-controlling talismans.

74
00:07:31,750 --> 00:07:32,390
Master.

75
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:41,260
Master Nangong,

76
00:07:41,290 --> 00:07:43,790
I have been very disrespectful today.

77
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,750
My father specifically sent me

78
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:48,760
to apologize to you, Master.

79
00:07:49,630 --> 00:07:50,390
What?

80
00:07:50,930 --> 00:07:52,400
The mine was sealed,

81
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:54,480
and the Yang family got anxious?

82
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:56,750
Apologize?

83
00:07:56,830 --> 00:07:58,920
Your family is in big trouble now.

84
00:08:07,870 --> 00:08:09,160
What time is it?

85
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:10,240
Who's there?

86
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,560
Mr. Liu, it's me.

87
00:08:15,630 --> 00:08:16,720
Miss Huaizhu?

88
00:08:27,430 --> 00:08:28,530
Alright, alright.

89
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:30,070
The medicine has taken effect.

90
00:08:30,070 --> 00:08:31,800
The burns to his internal organs

91
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:33,270
have a chance to heal now.

92
00:08:34,270 --> 00:08:36,750
However, he can't be moved for now.

93
00:08:37,030 --> 00:08:37,960
There's no rush.

94
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:40,039
We'll wait until he wakes up.

95
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:41,130
Sir,

96
00:08:41,669 --> 00:08:43,750
please bring some more medicine for external wounds.

97
00:08:43,750 --> 00:08:45,240
Then you can go and rest.

98
00:08:45,490 --> 00:08:46,790
I'll stay and watch over the patient.

99
00:08:46,790 --> 00:08:47,590
Alright then.

100
00:08:52,870 --> 00:08:54,670
I'm sorry for the trouble today.

101
00:08:55,240 --> 00:08:56,510
What trouble?

102
00:08:57,310 --> 00:08:59,040
You were the one who came with me

103
00:08:59,750 --> 00:09:02,010
and couldn't even complete our wedding.

104
00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:03,910
When you think about it later,

105
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:06,450
you'll probably feel a bit sad.

106
00:09:09,750 --> 00:09:12,510
If I feel sad, I'll blame you.

107
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:14,980
You'll have to put up with it then.

108
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:19,320
Okay,

109
00:09:20,270 --> 00:09:21,000
I'll bear it.

110
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:24,910
These two are showing off their love so much.

111
00:09:24,910 --> 00:09:25,670
What should I,

112
00:09:25,670 --> 00:09:27,870
a girl who hasn't found her ideal man yet,

113
00:09:27,870 --> 00:09:28,900
do about it?

114
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:30,870
What?

115
00:09:31,550 --> 00:09:34,030
Isn't our Yitan considered an ideal man?

116
00:09:34,890 --> 00:09:35,950
Have a seat, Yitan.

117
00:09:38,610 --> 00:09:40,000
Our Yitan

118
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,540
is indeed handsome,

119
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:43,840
but whenever I see him,

120
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:46,030
I think of when we were little and played together

121
00:09:46,030 --> 00:09:47,510
in the mud.

122
00:09:49,750 --> 00:09:51,550
That's clearly because you beat me black and blue

123
00:09:51,550 --> 00:09:53,280
and forced me to play in the mud.

124
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:54,630
Thank you.

125
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:57,000
If you're tired,

126
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:57,510
go rest.

127
00:09:57,510 --> 00:09:58,110
Thank you.

128
00:09:58,440 --> 00:10:00,630
I'll keep watch over Aunt and Uncle here.

129
00:10:00,630 --> 00:10:02,960
So you don't have to keep talking about me.

130
00:10:03,030 --> 00:10:04,030
It's fine.

131
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:05,520
I promised my brother

132
00:10:05,790 --> 00:10:07,150
that before he returns,

133
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:10,440
I will definitely protect all of you.

134
00:10:10,870 --> 00:10:12,360
Everyone must be hungry.

135
00:10:12,790 --> 00:10:14,320
These rice wine and osmanthus tangyuan

136
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:15,840
are our chef's specialty.

137
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,600
Everyone, please have some to tide you over.

138
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:19,400
Perfect, we're all a bit hungry.

139
00:10:28,150 --> 00:10:30,670
It's just a small wound, nothing to worry about.

140
00:10:30,670 --> 00:10:32,030
Every year, there are many

141
00:10:32,030 --> 00:10:34,030
heroes like you who try to act tough.

142
00:10:34,670 --> 00:10:35,870
They say it's nothing

143
00:10:36,390 --> 00:10:38,190
but end up with blood poisoning.

144
00:10:39,390 --> 00:10:40,390
Let me take a look.

145
00:11:25,030 --> 00:11:25,720
I'm sorry.

146
00:11:26,630 --> 00:11:27,550
I'm used to it.

147
00:11:29,790 --> 00:11:30,630
Actually,

148
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:32,450
it does hurt quite a bit.

149
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:37,490
Thank you for your help, Young Master.

150
00:11:39,510 --> 00:11:41,960
If your next line is "I'll repay this debt,"

151
00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:44,040
then there's no need.

152
00:11:44,790 --> 00:11:46,650
Actually, that kind of technique

153
00:11:46,870 --> 00:11:48,530
couldn't have hurt you at all.

154
00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:50,080
I was just meddling.

155
00:11:50,390 --> 00:11:51,240
I know

156
00:11:51,780 --> 00:11:53,310
that you weren't meddling.

157
00:11:54,920 --> 00:11:56,310
The "thank you" just now

158
00:11:56,670 --> 00:11:57,600
was sincere.

159
00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:12,790
If you

160
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:14,670
truly want to thank me,

161
00:12:15,630 --> 00:12:16,440
then…

162
00:12:18,190 --> 00:12:19,700
[Safflower Medicinal Wine]

163
00:12:19,910 --> 00:12:21,840
Then why don't you offer me a drink?

164
00:12:21,910 --> 00:12:23,310
Young Master, I'm afraid

165
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:25,320
it's inappropriate for you to drink now.

166
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:26,910
The safflower medicinal wine

167
00:12:26,910 --> 00:12:29,240
doesn't really count as alcohol, does it?

168
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:55,560
Miss Huaizhu, you treated me to a drink,

169
00:12:56,380 --> 00:12:58,010
but it's actually for me to watch you

170
00:12:58,010 --> 00:12:59,090
drink alone?

171
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:01,390
Sometimes I feel

172
00:13:02,120 --> 00:13:03,600
that there is

173
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:06,300
more than one of you inside your body.

174
00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:09,240
One of me is cunning and scheming,

175
00:13:09,790 --> 00:13:11,150
making you avoid me.

176
00:13:13,080 --> 00:13:14,480
What about the other one?

177
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:20,360
Why are you up?

178
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:28,750
You're seriously injured, Chu Jing.

179
00:13:28,750 --> 00:13:30,480
You should go back and lie down.

180
00:13:30,740 --> 00:13:34,820
I only killed because I was controlled by the demon-controlling talisman.

181
00:13:34,820 --> 00:13:36,620
It doesn't matter if I die.

182
00:13:36,870 --> 00:13:38,870
I was going to die in the mine anyway.

183
00:13:40,380 --> 00:13:41,650
But I beg you…

184
00:13:42,510 --> 00:13:43,510
Please

185
00:13:43,910 --> 00:13:45,820
save Xiaowu.

186
00:13:45,910 --> 00:13:47,320
Xiaowu, he...

187
00:13:48,310 --> 00:13:52,360
He's the kindest and most gentle person in the world.

188
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:54,790
Chu Jing, you're not well.

189
00:13:54,790 --> 00:13:55,650
Get up to speak.

190
00:13:55,670 --> 00:13:56,510
It's alright.

191
00:13:57,630 --> 00:13:58,760
I'm used to the pain.

192
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:01,000
I'm used to kneeling too.

193
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:05,080
Alright, since you insist,

194
00:14:05,390 --> 00:14:06,190
we'll listen.

195
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:08,910
How did you

196
00:14:09,510 --> 00:14:10,390
meet Xiaowu?

197
00:14:12,840 --> 00:14:13,670
Do you know

198
00:14:14,870 --> 00:14:15,870
what

199
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:17,910
"Chu Jing" means?

200
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:20,550
Hit him!

201
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:26,880
You dare to grow heartbreak grass in the mine?

202
00:14:27,330 --> 00:14:28,650
Are you trying to poison someone?

203
00:14:28,650 --> 00:14:30,180
Are you planning to escape?

204
00:14:30,270 --> 00:14:31,120
No.

205
00:14:31,670 --> 00:14:33,070
I don't know what this is.

206
00:14:33,550 --> 00:14:35,410
I just wanted to grow something.

207
00:14:35,720 --> 00:14:36,950
This is the only thing

208
00:14:37,030 --> 00:14:38,510
I could find to grow here.

209
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:40,630
You won't learn until you're at death's door.

210
00:14:40,630 --> 00:14:41,440
Keep hitting.

211
00:14:42,870 --> 00:14:43,520
Stop!

212
00:14:48,840 --> 00:14:50,500
This isn't heartbreak grass.

213
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:53,600
It's just a strangler fig that looks similar to heartbreak grass.

214
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:54,460
You may go now.

215
00:14:54,920 --> 00:14:55,340
Yes.

216
00:14:55,390 --> 00:14:55,940
Yes.

217
00:14:57,790 --> 00:14:58,870
What are you looking at?

218
00:14:58,870 --> 00:14:59,150
Get going!

219
00:14:59,150 --> 00:14:59,630
Get lost!

220
00:14:59,630 --> 00:15:00,000
Get back to work!

221
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:00,930
Get back to work!

222
00:15:08,270 --> 00:15:09,320
What's your name?

223
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:14,840
Chu Jing.

224
00:15:16,390 --> 00:15:17,600
My name is Chu Jing.

225
00:15:18,270 --> 00:15:20,870
I'm a carp demon

226
00:15:21,270 --> 00:15:23,790
responsible for surveying the earth's veins in the cave.

227
00:15:23,790 --> 00:15:24,630
Chu Jing...

228
00:15:36,520 --> 00:15:37,570
Do you know

229
00:15:38,120 --> 00:15:39,670
what "Chu Jing" means?

230
00:15:41,760 --> 00:15:43,060
I don't know.

231
00:15:48,440 --> 00:15:49,240
This flower

232
00:15:49,670 --> 00:15:50,670
is a sunflower.

233
00:15:56,910 --> 00:15:57,550
"Chu Jing"

234
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:00,720
means "sun."

235
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:04,850
I've looked into it.

236
00:16:05,030 --> 00:16:06,360
Your mother was captured and brought

237
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:08,510
to the cave when she was pregnant with you.

238
00:16:08,510 --> 00:16:09,960
You were born in the cave,

239
00:16:10,120 --> 00:16:10,850
weren't you?

240
00:16:15,380 --> 00:16:16,190
"Chu Jing"

241
00:16:17,320 --> 00:16:18,840
means "sun."

242
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:22,440
It's the sun

243
00:16:23,560 --> 00:16:25,690
you've never seen in your entire life.

244
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:31,120
The sun…

245
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:44,560
What are you thinking about?

246
00:16:45,510 --> 00:16:46,360
Well,

247
00:16:47,410 --> 00:16:49,180
there's no rain in this mine,

248
00:16:49,670 --> 00:16:51,390
and you have no water for the plants.

249
00:16:51,390 --> 00:16:52,780
How do you make them

250
00:16:52,960 --> 00:16:54,120
thrive so well?

251
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:55,910
Xiaowu,

252
00:16:56,600 --> 00:16:58,510
let me tell you a secret.

253
00:17:44,750 --> 00:17:46,610
You can control the wind and rain?

254
00:17:46,970 --> 00:17:49,230
Isn't that a skill only dragons possess?

255
00:17:50,510 --> 00:17:54,970
We carp demons are born from absorbing the spiritual energy of heaven and earth,

256
00:17:55,350 --> 00:17:57,150
so we can perform some magic too.

257
00:17:57,550 --> 00:17:59,250
We're not as powerful as dragons,

258
00:17:59,250 --> 00:18:00,180
but my mother...

259
00:18:02,680 --> 00:18:04,840
Before she died, she said

260
00:18:05,070 --> 00:18:07,000
she was originally a priestess in our tribe

261
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,440
and was very powerful.

262
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:13,400
Then,

263
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,130
can you make it snow?

264
00:18:15,380 --> 00:18:16,810
Snowing is difficult.

265
00:18:17,240 --> 00:18:18,900
Even my mother couldn't do it.

266
00:18:20,670 --> 00:18:22,080
That's a pity.

267
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:25,660
I grew up in the south.

268
00:18:25,830 --> 00:18:27,230
I've always wished

269
00:18:27,350 --> 00:18:29,160
to see a heavy snowfall.

270
00:18:31,770 --> 00:18:32,930
I can try.

271
00:19:08,010 --> 00:19:08,900
Chu Jing!

272
00:19:15,110 --> 00:19:18,350
Carp demons rely on the spiritual energy of heaven and earth to survive.

273
00:19:18,350 --> 00:19:19,350
Being confined in this mine like this,

274
00:19:19,350 --> 00:19:20,550
they won't live long.

275
00:19:20,920 --> 00:19:22,770
If they can't live, let them die.

276
00:19:23,240 --> 00:19:24,300
We'll capture more

277
00:19:24,300 --> 00:19:26,350
for our mineral vein exploration.

278
00:19:28,810 --> 00:19:29,850
Do demon lives

279
00:19:31,680 --> 00:19:32,960
not matter?

280
00:19:37,720 --> 00:19:38,510
Mu Renzhi,

281
00:19:39,510 --> 00:19:40,640
I'm warning you.

282
00:19:41,950 --> 00:19:44,960
The enmity between humans and demons is irreconcilable.

283
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:46,240
Sympathizing with demons

284
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:48,300
is a major taboo in the Yiqi Alliance.

285
00:19:49,070 --> 00:19:50,040
These demons

286
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:52,820
were all purchased from the Inspection Bureau.

287
00:19:52,820 --> 00:19:55,740
Each one is registered in the Huntian Prison.

288
00:19:55,920 --> 00:19:58,640
Don't you dare have any crooked thoughts.

289
00:20:10,790 --> 00:20:11,920
Take your medicine.

290
00:20:12,310 --> 00:20:13,440
When you're better,

291
00:20:13,640 --> 00:20:14,560
you'll have

292
00:20:14,790 --> 00:20:16,440
many more flowers to plant.

293
00:20:22,020 --> 00:20:23,020
After you get out,

294
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:26,510
you must be a good demon.

295
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:32,700
Xiaowu,

296
00:20:33,920 --> 00:20:35,110
I probably

297
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:38,550
won't be able to get out.

298
00:20:40,030 --> 00:20:42,160
After my parents coughed up blood,

299
00:20:43,790 --> 00:20:45,510
they passed away quickly.

300
00:20:47,920 --> 00:20:48,680
I probably

301
00:20:51,030 --> 00:20:53,270
won't get to see the sun.

302
00:20:55,510 --> 00:20:56,550
But Xiaowu,

303
00:20:57,830 --> 00:20:58,830
you definitely…

304
00:21:00,510 --> 00:21:02,510
definitely will be able to see snow.

305
00:21:13,030 --> 00:21:13,830
Later,

306
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:18,290
Xiaowu secretly released me.

307
00:21:19,110 --> 00:21:20,170
After getting out,

308
00:21:21,550 --> 00:21:23,400
I went to Master Zhou's place

309
00:21:23,920 --> 00:21:25,680
and became a gardener

310
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:27,790
in his garden.

311
00:21:30,790 --> 00:21:31,640
After that…

312
00:21:33,750 --> 00:21:36,240
After that, they came.

313
00:21:36,510 --> 00:21:37,300
They...

314
00:21:37,970 --> 00:21:40,350
They forced me to swallow a demon-controlling talisman.

315
00:21:40,350 --> 00:21:41,550
They even forced me

316
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:44,550
to kill someone.

317
00:21:54,470 --> 00:21:56,770
Do you see these people in front of you?

318
00:21:57,720 --> 00:21:58,860
Pick any one of them

319
00:21:59,500 --> 00:22:00,620
and kill them.

320
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:12,530
No, I can't.

321
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:13,670
No.

322
00:22:13,880 --> 00:22:15,570
I can't kill people.

323
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:22,960
Pick one.

324
00:22:23,070 --> 00:22:25,050
Kill him.

325
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:29,400
Come and buy vegetables!

326
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:31,180
Get lost!

327
00:22:40,340 --> 00:22:41,360
Please, I beg you.

328
00:22:41,830 --> 00:22:42,980
Get out of the way.

329
00:22:43,090 --> 00:22:44,750
I don't want to hurt you.

330
00:22:45,510 --> 00:22:47,040
What are you talking about?

331
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:51,120
Do you have a death wish?

332
00:23:15,290 --> 00:23:17,150
Kill him too.

333
00:23:17,310 --> 00:23:18,920
Do it now!

334
00:23:21,750 --> 00:23:22,550
Run!

335
00:23:23,790 --> 00:23:24,510
Run!

336
00:24:01,640 --> 00:24:03,220
You murderous demon!

337
00:24:03,350 --> 00:24:04,550
Come with me.

338
00:24:11,750 --> 00:24:12,460
Trying to run?

339
00:24:12,460 --> 00:24:13,330
After him!

340
00:24:14,440 --> 00:24:15,400
I can't resist

341
00:24:16,230 --> 00:24:17,880
the demon-controlling talisman.

342
00:24:17,880 --> 00:24:18,680
Don't worry.

343
00:24:19,510 --> 00:24:21,310
That half-burned mother talisman

344
00:24:21,310 --> 00:24:22,510
is in my hands now.

345
00:24:23,240 --> 00:24:24,680
The evidence is irrefutable.

346
00:24:24,680 --> 00:24:25,640
They won't get away.

347
00:24:25,640 --> 00:24:26,880
What about Xiaowu?

348
00:24:27,400 --> 00:24:29,000
He said Xiaowu was captured.

349
00:24:29,900 --> 00:24:31,680
When Xiaowu let me go,

350
00:24:31,790 --> 00:24:33,190
he repeatedly assured me

351
00:24:34,350 --> 00:24:36,270
that no one would find out.

352
00:24:37,960 --> 00:24:39,960
Mu Xiaowu came from a poor background,

353
00:24:39,960 --> 00:24:41,960
but he's hardworking and diligent.

354
00:24:41,960 --> 00:24:44,720
He became the mine tunnel leader at a young age.

355
00:24:45,350 --> 00:24:47,080
Many people are jealous of him.

356
00:24:47,410 --> 00:24:49,750
Someone reported you.

357
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:51,720
How could this happen?

358
00:24:52,160 --> 00:24:53,790
Xiaowu can't be in trouble.

359
00:24:54,590 --> 00:24:56,440
He has a beautiful fiancée.

360
00:24:56,720 --> 00:24:58,070
What can I do to save him?

361
00:25:02,350 --> 00:25:03,680
I can go back to the mine.

362
00:25:03,680 --> 00:25:04,240
Please

363
00:25:04,530 --> 00:25:05,960
send me back to the mine!

364
00:25:05,960 --> 00:25:06,350
Chu Jing.

365
00:25:06,350 --> 00:25:06,790
I beg you all!

366
00:25:06,790 --> 00:25:07,690
Chu Jing!

367
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:10,810
You won't be going back to the mine.

368
00:25:11,270 --> 00:25:12,590
I'll help you

369
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:14,160
protect Xiaowu.

370
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:15,440
Okay?

371
00:25:17,250 --> 00:25:18,240
Really?

372
00:25:20,440 --> 00:25:21,440
My word is my bond.

373
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:33,320
[Clairvoyant Yang Residence]

374
00:26:03,880 --> 00:26:04,680
Ying.

375
00:26:05,300 --> 00:26:06,170
Ying.

376
00:26:07,550 --> 00:26:09,640
I forgot you don't eat osmanthus.

377
00:26:10,830 --> 00:26:13,760
I put the sleeping drug in the osmanthus honey.

378
00:26:14,030 --> 00:26:16,470
But the honey has dissolved in the soup.

379
00:26:16,610 --> 00:26:18,140
You won't be awake for long.

380
00:26:19,350 --> 00:26:20,530
Why are you doing this?

381
00:26:20,530 --> 00:26:21,990
I have no choice.

382
00:26:22,160 --> 00:26:23,420
Nangong Chui threatened me

383
00:26:23,420 --> 00:26:25,880
that I must deliver Mu Xiaowu to him tonight.

384
00:26:26,070 --> 00:26:27,770
Otherwise, the grudge between him and the Yang family

385
00:26:27,770 --> 00:26:29,440
will be formed.

386
00:26:29,750 --> 00:26:30,830
You know,

387
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:33,400
even though the Nangong family lost Nangong Ye,

388
00:26:33,400 --> 00:26:35,460
they're still powerful and wealthy.

389
00:26:35,640 --> 00:26:37,240
We can't afford to offend them.

390
00:26:37,240 --> 00:26:38,270
Ying,

391
00:26:38,550 --> 00:26:40,810
Young Master Wangquan won't let you off.

392
00:26:41,550 --> 00:26:43,400
He's just a mine tunnel leader.

393
00:26:43,590 --> 00:26:46,590
Sending him over doesn't necessarily mean he'll die.

394
00:26:47,550 --> 00:26:50,510
How can Young Master Wangquan not spare the Yang family?

395
00:26:50,510 --> 00:26:52,030
Isn't Yitan still here?

396
00:26:54,790 --> 00:26:55,160
Ying.

397
00:26:55,160 --> 00:26:55,960
Take him away.

398
00:26:56,160 --> 00:26:56,960
Ying.

399
00:26:57,830 --> 00:26:59,680
No, no!

400
00:27:02,160 --> 00:27:02,790
No!

401
00:27:05,400 --> 00:27:06,070
Ying.

402
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:07,850
Ying, don't do this.

403
00:27:09,070 --> 00:27:10,930
Xiaowu, Xiaowu.

404
00:27:11,240 --> 00:27:12,270
Xiaowu.

405
00:27:13,880 --> 00:27:14,640
Let go.

406
00:27:15,510 --> 00:27:16,510
Xiaowu!

407
00:27:18,270 --> 00:27:19,640
I really don't understand.

408
00:27:19,640 --> 00:27:21,580
What's so good about this poor boy?

409
00:27:21,880 --> 00:27:23,590
Why are you so devoted to him?

410
00:27:24,140 --> 00:27:25,610
I want to see Father.

411
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:27,130
I want to see Father.

412
00:27:27,680 --> 00:27:28,800
Ying.

413
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:29,770
Ying!

414
00:27:29,880 --> 00:27:31,750
Do you really think I would dare to drug you all

415
00:27:31,750 --> 00:27:33,420
and send him to the Inspection Bureau

416
00:27:33,420 --> 00:27:35,230
without Father's permission?

417
00:27:50,550 --> 00:27:53,030
The demon and the fragments of the demon-controlling talisman

418
00:27:53,030 --> 00:27:55,590
have all been taken away by Wangquan Hongye.

419
00:27:56,350 --> 00:27:59,640
Isn't this just handing over the evidence

420
00:28:00,350 --> 00:28:02,920
and waiting for him to come after us?

421
00:28:03,550 --> 00:28:04,440
Master,

422
00:28:04,550 --> 00:28:06,240
that little demon was so badly injured.

423
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:08,550
It shouldn't be able to come back so quickly.

424
00:28:08,550 --> 00:28:09,240
Thanks to the Yang family

425
00:28:09,240 --> 00:28:11,040
for sending us such a great gift,

426
00:28:11,510 --> 00:28:12,770
we still have a chance.

427
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:14,440
What chance?

428
00:28:15,270 --> 00:28:17,160
From this boy's mouth, we can get

429
00:28:17,510 --> 00:28:19,640
evidence of the Yang family's collusion with demons.

430
00:28:19,640 --> 00:28:21,590
When the Yiqi Alliance meeting comes,

431
00:28:21,590 --> 00:28:23,450
we can set up the Wangquan family.

432
00:28:23,880 --> 00:28:25,280
Let's see what kind of dog

433
00:28:25,310 --> 00:28:27,840
Wangquan Hongye is trying so hard to protect.

434
00:28:27,960 --> 00:28:29,880
We can also ask the Wangquan family

435
00:28:29,880 --> 00:28:31,480
what their stance really is.

436
00:28:31,880 --> 00:28:33,680
They oppose using demon cores to forge swords

437
00:28:33,680 --> 00:28:35,310
and ban demon-controlling talismans.

438
00:28:35,310 --> 00:28:37,030
Are they demon sympathizers?

439
00:28:40,510 --> 00:28:41,590
Good idea.

440
00:28:41,880 --> 00:28:42,720
Come,

441
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:44,440
wake him up with water.

442
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:45,960
Master Nangong.

443
00:28:48,400 --> 00:28:50,540
I usually wake people up

444
00:28:50,830 --> 00:28:52,030
without using water.

445
00:31:02,550 --> 00:31:03,550
It seems

446
00:31:03,690 --> 00:31:05,410
you're afraid of pain too.

447
00:31:05,550 --> 00:31:06,920
Just a petty thief

448
00:31:06,920 --> 00:31:09,160
who has never practiced magic or martial arts.

449
00:31:09,160 --> 00:31:10,820
Of course he's afraid of pain.

450
00:31:12,550 --> 00:31:14,830
What exactly do you want to ask?

451
00:31:16,290 --> 00:31:18,430
I released Chu Jing,

452
00:31:19,550 --> 00:31:21,500
but he would never kill anyone.

453
00:31:21,830 --> 00:31:23,630
Did you release the little demon

454
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:26,960
on the orders of the Yang family?

455
00:31:29,160 --> 00:31:30,310
Of course not.

456
00:31:40,790 --> 00:31:42,540
The questions I ask you

457
00:31:43,030 --> 00:31:44,920
only need one kind of answer.

458
00:31:46,310 --> 00:31:47,640
Do you understand?

459
00:32:00,310 --> 00:32:01,440
Xiaowu.

460
00:32:50,090 --> 00:32:51,590
I see you.

461
00:32:52,260 --> 00:32:53,670
Wangquan Hongye,

462
00:32:54,860 --> 00:32:57,250
your love is destined to be in vain.

463
00:32:57,800 --> 00:33:00,180
All struggles are futile.

464
00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:01,750
Who are you?

465
00:33:02,440 --> 00:33:03,110
Me?

466
00:33:05,510 --> 00:33:07,360
I am the Eternal Night.

467
00:33:09,880 --> 00:33:12,080
That tree is getting bigger and bigger.

468
00:33:12,590 --> 00:33:14,850
Is the Eternal Night getting closer too?

469
00:33:16,270 --> 00:33:17,730
What kind of place is that?

470
00:33:18,510 --> 00:33:19,350
Father,

471
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:21,400
where are you?

472
00:33:26,160 --> 00:33:27,400
This place is shabby.

473
00:33:28,090 --> 00:33:29,890
You didn't sleep well all night.

474
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:32,080
You must've had nightmares.

475
00:33:36,350 --> 00:33:37,550
I added calming herbs

476
00:33:37,550 --> 00:33:38,880
in the medicine for him.

477
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:40,210
He won't wake up easily.

478
00:33:53,750 --> 00:33:55,160
Probably very few people

479
00:33:55,790 --> 00:33:58,120
were willing to make promises to Chu Jing.

480
00:33:58,440 --> 00:34:00,350
That's why he clung to you.

481
00:34:03,070 --> 00:34:04,570
I didn't expect Mu Xiaowu

482
00:34:04,750 --> 00:34:06,080
to be such a warm person.

483
00:34:06,350 --> 00:34:07,310
Yan said

484
00:34:08,280 --> 00:34:09,360
this man

485
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:11,760
always keeps his word

486
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:15,880
and he puts his all into everything he does.

487
00:34:17,150 --> 00:34:18,590
No matter what happens,

488
00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:21,230
just seeing him

489
00:34:21,550 --> 00:34:23,070
feels like coming home,

490
00:34:24,070 --> 00:34:25,929
because he always puts you first,

491
00:34:26,360 --> 00:34:29,510
making you feel like you're basking in spring breeze all the time.

492
00:34:29,510 --> 00:34:30,880
How many people

493
00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:33,210
in the world can receive such care?

494
00:34:34,030 --> 00:34:35,760
Being able to be a gentle person

495
00:34:36,590 --> 00:34:37,989
is also a kind of fortune.

496
00:34:43,840 --> 00:34:44,800
Don't worry.

497
00:34:45,510 --> 00:34:46,550
When he wakes up,

498
00:34:46,550 --> 00:34:48,750
we'll return to the Inspection Bureau.

499
00:34:48,920 --> 00:34:50,980
I will definitely protect Mu Xiaowu.

500
00:34:53,030 --> 00:34:54,630
Let me change your dressing.

501
00:35:03,840 --> 00:35:05,570
The wound is no longer serious,

502
00:35:06,360 --> 00:35:08,800
but it might leave a faint scar.

503
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:10,840
It's fine.

504
00:35:11,710 --> 00:35:13,040
There's one more thing.

505
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:15,230
How about I

506
00:35:15,230 --> 00:35:16,670
help detoxify you?

507
00:35:17,790 --> 00:35:18,660
Now?

508
00:35:19,030 --> 00:35:20,510
Please turn your palm up.

509
00:35:31,070 --> 00:35:31,960
It's done.

510
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:36,710
It's done?

511
00:35:37,840 --> 00:35:39,510
What I gave you last time

512
00:35:39,630 --> 00:35:41,160
was the Golden Flower Pill.

513
00:35:44,550 --> 00:35:46,160
No wonder I haven't felt

514
00:35:46,230 --> 00:35:47,920
any discomfort during this time.

515
00:35:47,920 --> 00:35:49,520
Instead, my mind felt clear.

516
00:35:50,590 --> 00:35:51,880
You are kind-hearted and virtuous,

517
00:35:51,880 --> 00:35:53,510
yet you didn't forget to deceive me

518
00:35:53,510 --> 00:35:54,570
to use as leverage.

519
00:35:55,800 --> 00:35:56,970
After all,

520
00:35:57,150 --> 00:35:58,880
you are Young Master Wangquan.

521
00:36:00,360 --> 00:36:01,550
Then why are you

522
00:36:02,110 --> 00:36:03,880
willing to detoxify me now?

523
00:36:04,760 --> 00:36:05,800
Because you are

524
00:36:06,710 --> 00:36:08,230
somewhat different

525
00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:10,140
from how I had thought.

526
00:36:12,670 --> 00:36:14,070
Then, the me in your heart

527
00:36:14,550 --> 00:36:16,350
and the me your sister speaks of,

528
00:36:16,710 --> 00:36:17,710
are they the same?

529
00:36:23,150 --> 00:36:24,550
At least not anymore.

530
00:36:25,400 --> 00:36:27,010
When this matter is resolved,

531
00:36:27,010 --> 00:36:28,480
I'll make up for the drink

532
00:36:28,590 --> 00:36:29,670
that I owe you.

533
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:31,670
Then I'll take it

534
00:36:31,950 --> 00:36:33,200
that in your heart,

535
00:36:34,070 --> 00:36:35,800
your opinion of me has changed.

536
00:36:38,840 --> 00:36:40,490
The medicine is almost ready.

537
00:36:40,490 --> 00:36:41,780
After Chu Jing wakes up

538
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:43,360
and drinks this medicine,

539
00:36:43,360 --> 00:36:44,890
he should be able to travel.

540
00:36:45,840 --> 00:36:47,970
Young Master, please rest for a while.

541
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:01,400
This child still has a bit of a cough.

542
00:37:01,560 --> 00:37:02,770
This cold medicine

543
00:37:02,840 --> 00:37:04,510
is excellent for preventing colds.

544
00:37:04,510 --> 00:37:06,040
[999 Cold Medicine]

545
00:37:04,630 --> 00:37:06,000
Take it back with you.

546
00:37:55,590 --> 00:37:56,400
Move aside.

547
00:37:57,670 --> 00:37:59,090
I want to see Mu Renzhi.

548
00:37:59,510 --> 00:38:01,630
Mu Renzhi is a serious criminal of the Inspection Bureau.

549
00:38:01,630 --> 00:38:04,030
How can you see him just because you want to?

550
00:38:09,490 --> 00:38:10,710
Move aside!

551
00:38:16,150 --> 00:38:17,900
I am Mu Renzhi's wife.

552
00:38:19,210 --> 00:38:20,710
What crime has he committed?

553
00:38:20,710 --> 00:38:22,010
Let me in.

554
00:38:22,210 --> 00:38:23,670
I'm willing to share his punishment.

555
00:38:23,670 --> 00:38:24,800
The Master said

556
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:26,150
no one is allowed in

557
00:38:26,150 --> 00:38:27,750
before the culprit is found.

558
00:38:34,230 --> 00:38:35,320
Move aside!

559
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:37,710
Move aside!

560
00:38:38,320 --> 00:38:39,630
Move aside!

561
00:38:47,810 --> 00:38:49,230
If you dare to make trouble again,

562
00:38:49,230 --> 00:38:52,290
I'll make sure you never see him again in this lifetime.

563
00:39:22,630 --> 00:39:23,510
Why would

564
00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:27,510
the Yang family want me to release Chu Jing?

565
00:39:27,510 --> 00:39:29,640
Because they're demon sympathizers.

566
00:39:30,280 --> 00:39:32,410
Not only are they demon sympathizers,

567
00:39:32,430 --> 00:39:34,670
but the Wangquan family is too.

568
00:39:40,820 --> 00:39:42,260
When I married Yan,

569
00:39:43,480 --> 00:39:44,970
I promised her

570
00:39:46,630 --> 00:39:48,440
that I would keep her safe and happy.

571
00:39:48,440 --> 00:39:50,550
Why are you telling me this nonsense?

572
00:39:53,510 --> 00:39:55,640
If the Yang family falls into trouble,

573
00:39:55,860 --> 00:39:58,200
Yan won't be safe and happy anymore.

574
00:40:00,630 --> 00:40:02,360
I'm poor and lowly,

575
00:40:03,550 --> 00:40:05,880
but I never break promises.

576
00:40:09,150 --> 00:40:11,000
It seems our guest

577
00:40:11,960 --> 00:40:13,510
doesn't know how to behave.

578
00:40:22,230 --> 00:40:23,760
Is this all you've got?

579
00:40:30,030 --> 00:40:31,630
Give him severe punishment.

580
00:40:31,920 --> 00:40:32,590
Yes, sir.

581
00:40:47,440 --> 00:40:48,800
Something has happened to the Yang family.
