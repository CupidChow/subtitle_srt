190
00:20:53,070 --> 00:20:55,200
Love is growing, and hatred is fading.

191
00:20:55,790 --> 00:20:58,250
Since the Grief Tree has already recovered,

192
00:20:59,030 --> 00:21:02,680
the Black Fox's power should have been weakened.

193
00:21:04,160 --> 00:21:06,620
I wonder how Hongye and the others are doing.

194
00:21:06,820 --> 00:21:08,680
You've exhausted your spiritual energy.

195
00:21:08,680 --> 00:21:10,340
I'll take you to Tianmen Pass.

196
00:21:11,270 --> 00:21:11,960
Alright.

197
00:21:12,310 --> 00:21:13,880
Deputy Chief, Miss Dongfang.

198
00:21:13,880 --> 00:21:16,920
Someone from the Divine Fire Villa is here. He's outside the boundary marker.

199
00:21:16,920 --> 00:21:17,960
What's the matter?

200
00:21:17,960 --> 00:21:19,200
He said his name is Dong.

201
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:20,640
Miss Qinlan told him to tell you

202
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:24,500
the old master is critically ill. She asks you to return immediately.

203
00:21:35,790 --> 00:21:36,720
Senior Renfeng.

204
00:21:43,160 --> 00:21:44,240
How is my father?

205
00:21:44,750 --> 00:21:45,680
Junior Huaizhu,

206
00:21:46,030 --> 00:21:47,490
you've finally returned.

207
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:49,830
A few days ago, when Master was practicing,

208
00:21:49,830 --> 00:21:51,830
he lost control of his inner energy.

209
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:01,350
Junior Huaizhu,

210
00:22:01,920 --> 00:22:04,670
I know how much you care for your father.

211
00:22:04,790 --> 00:22:06,880
Master lost control of his inner energy,

212
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:09,440
and I'm using my inner energy to sustain his life.

213
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:12,000
He needs rest now.

214
00:22:14,110 --> 00:22:15,660
Even I can't see him?

215
00:22:15,750 --> 00:22:17,790
Junior Huaizhu, you've been gone for so long.

216
00:22:17,790 --> 00:22:20,990
Why don't you visit Junior Qinlan at Lanzhu Garden first?

217
00:22:27,110 --> 00:22:31,350
Dong, escort Miss Huaizhu back to Lanzhu Garden.

218
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:35,800
Miss Huaizhu, this way, please.

219
00:22:44,430 --> 00:22:51,690
[Lanzhu Garden]

220
00:22:54,110 --> 00:22:55,110
You may stay here.

221
00:22:56,160 --> 00:22:57,220
Miss Huaizhu, I...

222
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:15,550
Huaizhu?

223
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:16,790
Huaizhu!

224
00:23:18,350 --> 00:23:21,000
That scoundrel Jin Renfeng is planning a rebellion.

225
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:22,720
Let's go and check on Father.

226
00:23:23,590 --> 00:23:24,240
Qinlan,

227
00:23:24,920 --> 00:23:27,030
something major happened in the Divine Fire Villa.

228
00:23:27,030 --> 00:23:29,230
I'll find a way to get you out of here now.

229
00:23:30,160 --> 00:23:30,960
I won't leave.

230
00:23:31,830 --> 00:23:32,550
Qinlan,

231
00:23:33,270 --> 00:23:34,550
you promised me that

232
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:37,330
in important matters, you'd listen to me.

233
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:41,200
I'm not leaving you.

234
00:23:42,500 --> 00:23:44,560
You don't want to part with me either.

235
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:47,280
Miss Huaizhu.

236
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:49,720
What is it?

237
00:23:49,940 --> 00:23:51,400
Senior Renfeng ordered me

238
00:23:51,590 --> 00:23:53,890
to bring Yuping to serve you two ladies.

239
00:23:54,270 --> 00:23:57,130
You're obviously just sending someone to spy on us!

240
00:23:59,720 --> 00:24:00,720
I see.

241
00:24:01,030 --> 00:24:01,830
Let her stay.

242
00:24:02,110 --> 00:24:02,790
Yes.

243
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:11,540
[Lanzhu Garden]

244
00:24:13,640 --> 00:24:14,400
You may rise.

245
00:24:16,030 --> 00:24:17,350
You had no choice.

246
00:24:18,160 --> 00:24:20,480
You've been following us for so many years.

247
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:22,610
I won't make things difficult for you.

248
00:24:26,680 --> 00:24:27,400
Yuping,

249
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:30,940
is there anything you want to tell me?

250
00:24:32,350 --> 00:24:33,200
Miss Huaizhu,

251
00:24:34,160 --> 00:24:35,110
Jin Renfeng...

252
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:38,460
Jin Renfeng killed the master.

253
00:24:38,680 --> 00:24:40,350
I saw it with my own eyes.

254
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:45,390
Senior Renfeng.

255
00:24:45,720 --> 00:24:47,830
Have you done everything as I instructed?

256
00:24:47,830 --> 00:24:49,200
Rest assured, Senior Renfeng.

257
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:52,330
Over the past few days, I've replaced Master's medicine

258
00:24:52,440 --> 00:24:56,000
with slow-acting poison, just as you ordered.

259
00:24:56,750 --> 00:24:59,310
He definitely won't be able to move tonight.

260
00:25:01,920 --> 00:25:03,520
Clear the area immediately.

261
00:25:03,830 --> 00:25:05,560
Tonight, not a single outsider

262
00:25:05,960 --> 00:25:09,110
is allowed to be here.

263
00:25:10,270 --> 00:25:11,000
Yes.

264
00:25:17,740 --> 00:25:18,950
Master,

265
00:25:20,020 --> 00:25:22,020
Junior Huaizhu has already noticed

266
00:25:22,310 --> 00:25:24,440
that I'm in cahoots with the Black Fox.

267
00:25:25,130 --> 00:25:27,370
She'll definitely purge me from the sect

268
00:25:27,370 --> 00:25:28,650
and kick me out.

269
00:25:30,550 --> 00:25:31,960
All these years,

270
00:25:32,830 --> 00:25:34,430
I've been working like a dog,

271
00:25:36,200 --> 00:25:37,400
but to you,

272
00:25:39,350 --> 00:25:41,030
I've always been just a mutt

273
00:25:41,830 --> 00:25:44,350
you could throw out anytime.

274
00:25:46,680 --> 00:25:48,350
It's unfair.

275
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:49,640
In terms of looks

276
00:25:50,310 --> 00:25:51,540
and talent,

277
00:25:52,850 --> 00:25:55,780
how am I inferior to Wangquan Hongye?

278
00:25:58,160 --> 00:26:01,120
My only disadvantage is my background.

279
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:03,590
Master,

280
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:07,460
you're not going to live much longer anyway.

281
00:26:07,830 --> 00:26:08,790
Why don't you give me the blood in your body

282
00:26:08,790 --> 00:26:11,570
that controls the Pure Yang Flame

283
00:26:13,030 --> 00:26:15,890
and let me become the true Fire God?

284
00:27:18,310 --> 00:27:20,060
With your blood,

285
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:24,460
the power of the Divine Fire will be completely different.

286
00:27:34,210 --> 00:27:36,480
Master, don't worry.

287
00:27:37,090 --> 00:27:39,020
I have already replaced your blood

288
00:27:39,400 --> 00:27:41,080
with mine.

289
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:44,030
No one will notice.

290
00:27:48,570 --> 00:27:49,890
Oh right, Master.

291
00:27:50,470 --> 00:27:52,670
I also plan to marry both Junior Sisters

292
00:27:53,680 --> 00:27:55,200
to make full use

293
00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:59,170
of the other secret hidden in the Dongfang Spiritual Blood.

294
00:28:03,380 --> 00:28:04,770
Do you hate me?

295
00:28:07,990 --> 00:28:09,190
It's useless.

296
00:28:10,620 --> 00:28:12,580
I told you a long time ago

297
00:28:14,750 --> 00:28:16,070
that they are mine.

298
00:28:38,110 --> 00:28:40,310
You saw my father die with your own eyes?

299
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:42,350
I saw the old master

300
00:28:43,240 --> 00:28:45,240
close his eyes with my own eyes.

301
00:28:50,070 --> 00:28:51,440
Jin Renfeng!

302
00:28:52,830 --> 00:28:54,750
Go to hell!

303
00:28:57,350 --> 00:28:58,070
Qinlan.

304
00:28:59,920 --> 00:29:02,370
He has now mastered the Pure Yang Flame.

305
00:29:04,030 --> 00:29:06,530
I've exhausted all my spiritual energy.

306
00:29:13,400 --> 00:29:15,030
We are no match for him.

307
00:29:16,200 --> 00:29:18,000
There are lots of outsiders in the villa.

308
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:20,260
They're all Senior Renfeng's henchmen.

309
00:29:22,270 --> 00:29:23,680
I don't care.

310
00:29:23,960 --> 00:29:26,030
He must die!

311
00:29:34,580 --> 00:29:35,550
Yuping.

312
00:29:37,680 --> 00:29:38,920
Go and tell Dong

313
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:43,960
that Qinlan is ill.

314
00:29:45,790 --> 00:29:46,720
Okay.
