00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:45,710
[Love in Pavilion]

2
00:01:46,390 --> 00:01:50,740
[Episode 28]

3
00:02:28,750 --> 00:02:29,940
Lord Jiuhuo,

4
00:02:30,690 --> 00:02:31,890
forgive me.

5
00:02:33,579 --> 00:02:35,060
I cannot

6
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:38,740
return to Mount Xuankong with you this time.

7
00:03:09,270 --> 00:03:11,710
Though the fox's physical body is destroyed,

8
00:03:11,710 --> 00:03:13,650
she can still manifest her spirit.

9
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:17,710
Since you two are so in love,

10
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:19,800
I

11
00:03:20,170 --> 00:03:22,530
shall let you stay here

12
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:27,579
and accompany this demon for all eternity.

13
00:03:35,670 --> 00:03:38,310
The ruler of the Beast Kingdom sacrificed Jia Lan,

14
00:03:38,310 --> 00:03:39,430
sealed Jiuhuo,

15
00:03:40,180 --> 00:03:43,240
and ruled the world with the demon-controlling talisman.

16
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:44,880
He never anticipated that

17
00:03:45,230 --> 00:03:48,560
Jia Lan's primordial soul could absorb the world's hatred.

18
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:50,800
This power is beyond imagination.

19
00:03:56,710 --> 00:03:59,570
Liars, they're all liars.

20
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:01,650
They say I'm evil.

21
00:04:01,670 --> 00:04:03,100
But you're even worse.

22
00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:07,830
No one in this world deserves the light.

23
00:04:08,780 --> 00:04:10,260
If that's the case,

24
00:04:10,630 --> 00:04:12,480
why don't I become the darkness?

25
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:33,130
So this is how hatred feels... so delightful.

26
00:04:34,770 --> 00:04:37,159
I should have done this sooner.

27
00:04:38,760 --> 00:04:41,080
I'm so hungry now.

28
00:04:42,010 --> 00:04:44,159
Where should I go to feed?

29
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:51,770
Let's go to the Beast Kingdom.

30
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:56,200
Jia Lan slaughtered the Beast Kingdom overnight.

31
00:04:56,200 --> 00:04:59,409
The unjustly killed souls generated endless resentment.

32
00:04:59,409 --> 00:05:01,640
She absorbed all this hatred into her body.

33
00:05:01,640 --> 00:05:03,480
Her power grew stronger day by day.

34
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:06,240
She could control not only demons but also humans.

35
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:08,110
She made them kill each other.

36
00:05:08,130 --> 00:05:11,460
The endless hatred continued to nourish Jia Lan.

37
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:12,800
And so,

38
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:15,380
she finally lost herself completely

39
00:05:15,690 --> 00:05:17,490
and became Lady Black Fox.

40
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:19,730
The Black Fox has no physical body.

41
00:05:20,130 --> 00:05:21,770
She feeds on hatred

42
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:24,400
and kills wherever she goes.

43
00:05:24,630 --> 00:05:25,920
That's why later,

44
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:27,890
the Third Young Master of the Aolai Kingdom used all his strength

45
00:05:27,890 --> 00:05:30,220
to keep the Black Fox beyond the Boundary.

46
00:05:33,830 --> 00:05:34,920
Now look over here.

47
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,390
The evil energy under the altar

48
00:05:37,390 --> 00:05:39,920
is from the innocent people sacrificed

49
00:05:40,070 --> 00:05:42,670
by the ruler and Northern Hill Elder back then.

50
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:47,050
This is the secret you've been trying to cover up.

51
00:05:48,250 --> 00:05:50,710
Control demons and one can rule the world...

52
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:53,730
Even if all the previous rulers knew this secret,

53
00:05:53,730 --> 00:05:55,080
who would care?

54
00:05:55,390 --> 00:05:56,600
Miss, you're right.

55
00:05:56,620 --> 00:05:59,530
But among the 36 rulers of the Beast Kingdom,

56
00:05:59,550 --> 00:06:02,730
one ruler fell in love with a female demon.

57
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:04,120
He put all his effort into researching

58
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:06,590
a way to break the demon-controlling talisman.

59
00:06:06,590 --> 00:06:09,790
And he wrote it down in this secret chamber.

60
00:06:11,090 --> 00:06:12,830
If there's a way to break it,

61
00:06:13,270 --> 00:06:14,400
why didn't he use it?

62
00:06:15,010 --> 00:06:16,490
Once the demon-controlling talisman is broken,

63
00:06:16,490 --> 00:06:18,830
the demons who have long been abused and enslaved

64
00:06:18,830 --> 00:06:20,490
will no longer be restrained.

65
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:22,770
They'll kill the demon tamers.

66
00:06:24,210 --> 00:06:26,390
The demon race would seek revenge madly.

67
00:06:26,390 --> 00:06:27,390
An eye for an eye,

68
00:06:27,890 --> 00:06:29,070
blood for blood.

69
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:33,390
There's no turning back on the path of demon-controlling.

70
00:06:33,390 --> 00:06:35,720
So, he could only give up.

71
00:06:37,310 --> 00:06:40,159
Ruler Bumu, your task is heavy and the road is long.

72
00:06:40,380 --> 00:06:42,440
As long as the Black Fox still exists,

73
00:06:42,690 --> 00:06:45,780
the path of demon-controlling will not end.

74
00:06:46,630 --> 00:06:47,190
No.

75
00:06:48,100 --> 00:06:50,000
As long as we eliminate the Black Fox,

76
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,530
everything can be stopped.

77
00:06:52,860 --> 00:06:53,580
Bumu,

78
00:06:54,670 --> 00:06:56,530
I need the names of all the victims

79
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:58,120
in this mass grave.

80
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:11,580
Is the medicine ready?

81
00:07:11,580 --> 00:07:12,500
Almost done.

82
00:07:12,750 --> 00:07:13,800
Meng Yun,

83
00:07:13,870 --> 00:07:15,860
who is this cold medicine for?

84
00:07:18,570 --> 00:07:20,010
Miss Dongfang said,

85
00:07:20,100 --> 00:07:21,540
[999 Cold Medicine]

86
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:22,040
the young master stayed up all night yesterday

87
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:23,570
and sneezed several times.

88
00:07:23,870 --> 00:07:25,700
Has she accepted him already?

89
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:42,159
They look good together.

90
00:07:44,750 --> 00:07:47,190
Although Wangquan is good to Huaizhu,

91
00:07:47,370 --> 00:07:49,240
the masked sir is not bad either.

92
00:07:53,010 --> 00:07:54,610
Why are you giving this to me?

93
00:07:59,430 --> 00:08:00,820
When in doubt,

94
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:04,290
why not consult the will of heaven?

95
00:08:05,850 --> 00:08:08,250
You're not making me count petals, are you?

96
00:08:08,750 --> 00:08:11,240
That's so cliché and boring.

97
00:08:11,260 --> 00:08:13,120
If you don't want it, give it back.

98
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:21,090
I didn't expect

99
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:23,520
Qinlan to care so much about me and the mask.

100
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:25,250
Tell her.

101
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:27,880
She deserves to know.

102
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:34,150
Qinlan,

103
00:08:34,549 --> 00:08:35,909
as we're about to part ways,

104
00:08:35,909 --> 00:08:37,120
I have a gift for you.

105
00:08:42,870 --> 00:08:44,240
I can't accept a gift without merit.

106
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:45,120
I don't want it.

107
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:49,870
Why don't you take a look first?

108
00:08:49,870 --> 00:08:51,330
Little heroine Dongfang.

109
00:09:00,860 --> 00:09:02,570
Ma... ma... ma...

110
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:08,240
Sister,

111
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:10,270
you knew all along, didn't you?

112
00:09:13,450 --> 00:09:16,850
Your sister only found out recently as well.

113
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:20,270
I feel

114
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:23,050
the shock isn't big enough yet.

115
00:09:24,390 --> 00:09:25,920
Let me give you a bonus gift.

116
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:33,440
Good evening, little heroine.

117
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:36,450
Puppy Li, how dare you bully me too?

118
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:38,410
Come here! I'll give you a beating!

119
00:09:39,730 --> 00:09:40,670
Stop right there!

120
00:09:40,670 --> 00:09:41,270
Li Quzhuo!

121
00:09:41,270 --> 00:09:42,470
You stop right there!

122
00:09:43,020 --> 00:09:44,240
I'm giving you a way out.

123
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:46,100
Just chase me a little and quit it.

124
00:09:47,370 --> 00:09:48,980
You sneaky Puppy Li.

125
00:09:49,490 --> 00:09:51,350
I've been your master for so long,

126
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:53,530
and you didn't let slip even a hint.

127
00:09:53,840 --> 00:09:55,510
You made me agonize over

128
00:09:55,550 --> 00:09:57,150
Wangquan and the masked sir.

129
00:09:57,680 --> 00:09:59,300
Have you no conscience?

130
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:01,410
Alright.

131
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:06,070
I'm sorry about that.

132
00:10:12,030 --> 00:10:12,890
How about this,

133
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:15,270
I can grant you one wish.

134
00:10:16,290 --> 00:10:17,840
Anything?

135
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:20,660
It has to be reasonable and legal, of course.

136
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:22,150
But Miss Qinlan,

137
00:10:22,150 --> 00:10:24,510
a well-mannered young lady like you surely

138
00:10:24,510 --> 00:10:25,870
wouldn't make things difficult for me.

139
00:10:25,870 --> 00:10:27,240
How boring.

140
00:10:27,750 --> 00:10:28,790
I bet

141
00:10:28,910 --> 00:10:30,570
you just wanted to lure me away

142
00:10:30,630 --> 00:10:32,150
so Hongye and Huaizhu

143
00:10:32,150 --> 00:10:34,000
can have some alone time.

144
00:10:34,150 --> 00:10:34,870
Look,

145
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:37,790
this is our last night in the Beast Kingdom.

146
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:38,910
Why don't we

147
00:10:38,910 --> 00:10:41,040
give them some space to be alone?

148
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:44,510
Let them pour their hearts out to each other.

149
00:10:45,960 --> 00:10:46,670
Besides,

150
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:50,760
I have something I want to talk to you about.

151
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:52,270
What is it?

152
00:11:01,700 --> 00:11:03,480
After all we've been through,

153
00:11:03,910 --> 00:11:06,680
we've become like siblings,

154
00:11:06,700 --> 00:11:09,010
sharing joys and sorrows.

155
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:15,030
Do you have someone you like?

156
00:11:16,750 --> 00:11:17,550
Tell me,

157
00:11:17,730 --> 00:11:19,190
I'll give you some advice.

158
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:21,870
Someone I like?

159
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,130
I think I might actually have someone.

160
00:11:27,870 --> 00:11:29,320
When I was little,

161
00:11:29,390 --> 00:11:30,850
I had a childhood friend.

162
00:11:30,910 --> 00:11:32,370
He was really good at painting.

163
00:11:32,370 --> 00:11:34,190
So I learned to paint too.

164
00:11:37,550 --> 00:11:38,150
And then?

165
00:11:38,550 --> 00:11:39,550
Then...

166
00:11:39,630 --> 00:11:41,600
Then he moved away, and that was it.

167
00:11:43,410 --> 00:11:44,270
What about you?

168
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:46,750
Me?

169
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:50,240
I... of course I had one too.

170
00:11:52,870 --> 00:11:53,670
It's just...

171
00:11:54,790 --> 00:11:56,250
Before I could even speak,

172
00:11:56,270 --> 00:11:57,730
she had already run away.

173
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:01,440
Maybe...

174
00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:03,980
It wasn't meant to be.

175
00:12:08,910 --> 00:12:10,870
It's okay, Puppy Li.

176
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,260
Don't be discouraged.

177
00:12:15,900 --> 00:12:17,050
This is for you.

178
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:20,510
When you meet a girl you like in the future,

179
00:12:20,510 --> 00:12:22,000
give this to her.

180
00:12:25,350 --> 00:12:28,060
Did you make this yourself?

181
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:30,320
Of course...

182
00:12:30,510 --> 00:12:31,600
Not.

183
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:34,070
But I bought it myself.

184
00:12:34,090 --> 00:12:36,360
I saw it at the market and thought it was pretty.

185
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:38,090
I thought I could give it to you.

186
00:12:40,170 --> 00:12:41,670
It's thoughtful, regardless.

187
00:12:41,670 --> 00:12:42,530
I'll accept it.

188
00:12:49,030 --> 00:12:50,360
I have a gift for you too.

189
00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:51,080
What is it?

190
00:12:51,630 --> 00:12:53,160
A teleportation talisman.

191
00:12:53,710 --> 00:12:55,510
If you encounter danger in the future,

192
00:12:55,510 --> 00:12:58,300
whether you're in a barrier or a magic array,

193
00:12:58,440 --> 00:12:59,840
activate this talisman,

194
00:12:59,840 --> 00:13:02,720
and it'll instantly teleport you 3 miles away.

195
00:13:05,840 --> 00:13:06,550
Thanks.

196
00:13:09,270 --> 00:13:09,960
Puppy Li,

197
00:13:14,870 --> 00:13:15,510
take care.

198
00:13:18,580 --> 00:13:19,710
Have a safe journey.

199
00:13:52,860 --> 00:13:53,650
Huaizhu.

200
00:13:56,540 --> 00:13:57,370
Father.

201
00:13:58,040 --> 00:13:59,700
Qinlan told me that you came up

202
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:04,320
to this back mountain alone as soon as you returned.

203
00:14:06,150 --> 00:14:07,940
You're back at the manor,

204
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:11,420
why didn't you come see me?

205
00:14:13,950 --> 00:14:15,410
Alright, alright.

206
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:18,440
If you don't want to talk about it, that's fine.

207
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:20,300
I'm just glad you're back safely.

208
00:14:21,570 --> 00:14:23,210
That girl Qinlan.

209
00:14:23,510 --> 00:14:24,910
As soon as she came through the door and saw me,

210
00:14:24,910 --> 00:14:27,150
she gave me a big, tight hug.

211
00:14:27,790 --> 00:14:30,510
I didn't even have time to say a few words to her.

212
00:14:30,630 --> 00:14:31,510
That girl.

213
00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:33,150
She immediately started fiddling with

214
00:14:33,150 --> 00:14:35,150
all the new things she brought back.

215
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:41,200
You must have gained a lot from this journey.

216
00:14:45,240 --> 00:14:46,080
We...

217
00:14:49,030 --> 00:14:50,440
We saw Mother.

218
00:15:02,150 --> 00:15:03,030
So...

219
00:15:04,550 --> 00:15:06,390
You learned her story,

220
00:15:07,960 --> 00:15:09,020
and you also saw...

221
00:15:12,550 --> 00:15:14,120
You saw her shadow.

222
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:17,750
Yes.

223
00:15:27,630 --> 00:15:28,490
Your mother...

224
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,860
Is she still as beautiful as she was back then?

225
00:15:36,510 --> 00:15:38,120
If she saw me now...

226
00:15:39,380 --> 00:15:41,910
Father, your charm hasn't diminished at all.

227
00:15:44,330 --> 00:15:45,430
Really?

228
00:15:46,360 --> 00:15:47,200
Really.

229
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:49,960
Good.

230
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:51,630
Mother also said...

231
00:15:53,510 --> 00:15:54,510
She wanted us to

232
00:15:55,420 --> 00:15:56,620
give you a hug for her.

233
00:16:11,840 --> 00:16:12,610
Father,

234
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:15,500
all these years,

235
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:18,320
it's been hard on you.

236
00:16:29,670 --> 00:16:30,870
It wasn't hard for me.

237
00:16:33,240 --> 00:16:36,280
Seeing you two grow up happily,

238
00:16:38,030 --> 00:16:39,240
I'm content.

239
00:18:02,680 --> 00:18:03,920
Are you leaving now?

240
00:18:10,220 --> 00:18:12,480
From the day you entered Huntian Prison,

241
00:18:13,710 --> 00:18:15,840
I investigated everything about you.

242
00:18:17,350 --> 00:18:19,210
I determined that you were innocent.

243
00:18:19,210 --> 00:18:20,430
I also confirmed

244
00:18:21,080 --> 00:18:23,480
that you deliberately entered the prison.

245
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:26,980
Soon,

246
00:18:27,390 --> 00:18:29,040
I figured out your purpose.

247
00:18:30,560 --> 00:18:32,160
You wanted to get close to me,

248
00:18:33,680 --> 00:18:34,590
to attract me.

249
00:18:37,380 --> 00:18:38,730
And the sad thing is,

250
00:18:40,340 --> 00:18:41,720
even though I knew this,

251
00:18:43,830 --> 00:18:45,650
I willingly fell into your trap.

252
00:18:53,490 --> 00:18:54,690
I also know

253
00:18:55,590 --> 00:18:57,420
that you're actually quite skilled,

254
00:18:57,420 --> 00:18:59,680
but you've been deliberately hiding it.

255
00:19:00,100 --> 00:19:00,970
So,

256
00:19:02,120 --> 00:19:04,560
I've been preparing something

257
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:08,440
as a gift to propose to you.

258
00:19:10,250 --> 00:19:13,070
I observed the callus distribution on your right hand

259
00:19:13,070 --> 00:19:13,920
and thought

260
00:19:15,340 --> 00:19:16,670

You talk so much despite your lack of education.

353
00:23:46,750 --> 00:23:48,640
But you need to say the secret code first.

354
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:49,770
What secret code?

355
00:23:49,880 --> 00:23:51,030
Are we that close?

356
00:24:00,510 --> 00:24:01,240
Zui,

357
00:24:01,590 --> 00:24:03,390
you aren't following the rules.

00:24:04,090 --> 00:24:06,800
Oh, it's the young and early-married Qiyue.

359
00:24:07,160 --> 00:24:08,790
Not staying home to take care of your child?

360

361
00:24:10,160 --> 00:24:12,130
Hongye told us to gather here.

362
00:24:12,510 --> 00:24:13,400
Our gathering at the Sky-breaking Temple

363
00:24:13,400 --> 00:24:15,000
is becoming more and more undisciplined.

364
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:17,800
Only Qiyue still insists on using the secret code.

365
00:24:18,270 --> 00:24:19,470
That's commendable.

366
00:24:19,720 --> 00:24:20,640
Yitan is right.

367
00:24:21,310 --> 00:24:22,640
We are an organization.

368
00:24:22,810 --> 00:24:25,070
- An organization has its own rules.
- Hongye.

00:24:30,920 --> 00:24:32,710
Unveil the mask of the world.

373
00:24:35,070 --> 00:24:35,680
Hongye,

374
00:24:35,820 --> 00:24:38,510
why aren't you wearing the mask Sister-in-law gave you?

375
00:24:38,510 --> 00:24:39,640
Then I'll change it.

376
00:24:42,130 --> 00:24:44,390
What did you all experience this time?

377
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:45,980
We experienced...

378
00:24:46,790 --> 00:24:47,680
Growth.

379
00:25:08,910 --> 00:25:10,530
As expected of my sister-in-law.

380
00:25:10,530 --> 00:25:13,660
My brother finally has the demeanor of a sword immortal.

381
00:25:21,630 --> 00:25:23,310
I just changed a mask,

382
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:24,800
what's the big deal?

383
00:25:25,400 --> 00:25:26,270
He's

384
00:25:26,270 --> 00:25:27,510
showing off his love.

385
00:25:31,860 --> 00:25:33,140
Now, let's begin.

386
00:25:33,590 --> 00:25:35,520
I have a few announcements to make.

387
00:25:35,640 --> 00:25:36,170
Alright.

388
00:25:36,270 --> 00:25:37,000
First,

389
00:25:37,270 --> 00:25:38,270
the Mask Group

390
00:25:38,810 --> 00:25:40,670
has a new member joining us today.

391
00:25:51,570 --> 00:25:52,920
Dark Sword Zhang Zheng.

392
00:25:54,710 --> 00:25:55,530
Yuan,

393
00:25:55,720 --> 00:25:56,750
he couldn't have come all this way

394
00:25:56,750 --> 00:25:58,350
just to pursue you, could he?

395
00:26:05,350 --> 00:26:06,200
I'm here

396
00:26:06,570 --> 00:26:07,400
to join you.

397
00:26:10,030 --> 00:26:11,470
Join us?

398
00:26:11,830 --> 00:26:13,460
Shouldn't you ask what we do

399
00:26:13,550 --> 00:26:14,950
before asking to join us?

400
00:26:15,170 --> 00:26:16,170
He said you want to

401
00:26:17,090 --> 00:26:18,570
prevent conflicts between humans and demons,

402
00:26:18,570 --> 00:26:21,070
break the darkness, and eliminate the Black Fox.

403
00:26:21,070 --> 00:26:22,800
Although the goal seems vague,

404
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:24,500
Yuan is here.

405
00:26:25,350 --> 00:26:26,750
I believe it's possible.

406
00:26:28,590 --> 00:26:31,050
Dark Sword Zhang Zheng, slayer of darkness.

407
00:26:31,270 --> 00:26:32,180
Starting today,

408
00:26:32,180 --> 00:26:33,840
you're part of the Mask Group,

409
00:26:33,910 --> 00:26:35,120
ranking eighth.

410
00:26:35,510 --> 00:26:36,510
Welcome, junior.

411
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:01,790
[Zhang Zheng Of Mask Group]

412
00:27:05,100 --> 00:27:07,360
It's slightly prettier than I imagined.

413
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:09,590
Qingmu,

414
00:27:09,960 --> 00:27:12,740
you've won over Master Zhang Zheng.

415
00:27:12,770 --> 00:27:14,250
It was a piece of cake.

416
00:27:15,290 --> 00:27:17,230
Now, I'll announce the second matter.

417
00:27:17,230 --> 00:27:19,140
During this journey to the Beast Kingdom,

418
00:27:19,140 --> 00:27:21,470
I've found a way to deal with the Black Fox.

419
00:27:21,510 --> 00:27:22,850
The Black Fox thrives on hatred,

420
00:27:22,850 --> 00:27:24,090
its power is astonishing.

421
00:27:24,090 --> 00:27:25,770
If we want to eliminate the Black Fox,

422
00:27:25,770 --> 00:27:28,110
we must stop the conflict between humans and demons.

423
00:27:28,110 --> 00:27:29,320
The Yiqi Alliance

424
00:27:29,860 --> 00:27:31,990
is due for a complete transformation.

425
00:27:54,850 --> 00:27:55,710
Come out.

426
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:05,170
Senior Renfeng.

427
00:28:05,550 --> 00:28:06,640
It's late at night.

428
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:07,640
Why have you returned?

429
00:28:07,640 --> 00:28:09,970
Shouldn't I be the one asking you that?

430
00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:12,100
During these days when I was away,

431
00:28:12,460 --> 00:28:15,060
what have you been sneaking around doing here?

432
00:28:15,350 --> 00:28:17,280
Senior Renfeng, I was actually...

433
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:19,500
Senior,

434
00:28:19,680 --> 00:28:20,960
I was wrong! I was wrong!

435
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:22,020
Please forgive me this time.

436
00:28:22,020 --> 00:28:23,440
Please forgive me, Senior.

437
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:25,370
The last time you stole something,

438
00:28:25,550 --> 00:28:27,150
what did the Master tell you?

439
00:28:27,400 --> 00:28:29,130
Have you forgotten so quickly?

440
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:30,200
Senior Renfeng,

441
00:28:30,200 --> 00:28:31,960
you absolutely cannot tell the Master about this.

442
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:34,090
He will surely expel me from the villa.

443
00:28:34,310 --> 00:28:35,870
Senior, Senior!

444
00:28:35,890 --> 00:28:36,790
Senior!

445
00:28:48,200 --> 00:28:50,060
It's just a bit of money, isn't it?

446
00:28:54,830 --> 00:28:55,510
Senior.

447
00:28:55,820 --> 00:28:56,400
Take it.

448
00:29:00,750 --> 00:29:01,440
Dong,

449
00:29:03,160 --> 00:29:04,640
I know you love to gamble,

450
00:29:05,640 --> 00:29:08,170
and I know you're not content being a servant.

451
00:29:09,350 --> 00:29:10,640
You're like me,

452
00:29:11,590 --> 00:29:13,510
we're both ambitious people.

453
00:29:15,790 --> 00:29:16,790
Follow me closely and

454
00:29:16,790 --> 00:29:17,790
obey my orders.

455
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:21,410
In the future, the chief steward of Divine Fire Villa

456
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:25,110
will be you.

457
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:32,020
Mr. Fei,

458
00:29:32,350 --> 00:29:34,550
you've brought me five meals in one day.

459
00:29:34,900 --> 00:29:36,030
Is something wrong?

460
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:38,590
You've often been away from home recently.

461
00:29:38,590 --> 00:29:39,920
I've been at a loose end.

462
00:29:41,740 --> 00:29:42,980
Oh, Young Master,

463
00:29:43,590 --> 00:29:45,900
your 26th birthday is approaching.

464
00:29:46,070 --> 00:29:47,270
Do you have any plans?

465
00:29:47,270 --> 00:29:48,200
Mr. Fei,

466
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:50,090
I'm suddenly tired.

467
00:29:51,550 --> 00:29:52,350
Alright.

468
00:30:00,160 --> 00:30:01,830
Mr. Fei, Mr. Fei.

469
00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:04,830
Mr. Fei,

470
00:30:04,830 --> 00:30:07,640
what did my brother say about his birthday?

471
00:30:08,310 --> 00:30:09,590
As always.

472
00:30:11,350 --> 00:30:12,480
It's been ten years.

473
00:30:12,790 --> 00:30:14,790
Why is my brother still so stubborn?

474
00:30:14,920 --> 00:30:17,050
He refuses to celebrate his birthday.

475
00:30:17,680 --> 00:30:18,880
Nothing is absolute.

476
00:30:19,550 --> 00:30:22,310
Actually, the person who can light up Hongye's heart

477
00:30:22,310 --> 00:30:23,640
has already appeared.

478
00:30:25,400 --> 00:30:26,160
That's right!

479
00:30:26,160 --> 00:30:27,560
We can ask Mrs. Wangquan.

480
00:30:27,750 --> 00:30:28,350
Let's go.

481
00:30:29,550 --> 00:30:30,240
We're off.

482
00:30:31,340 --> 00:30:33,000
Let's notify the others while we're at it.

483
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:35,440
It'll be better if it's lively and bustling.

484
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:36,920
Ah, young people.

485
00:30:51,310 --> 00:30:52,000
Zui?

486
00:30:55,440 --> 00:30:56,370
Sister-in-law,

487
00:30:56,400 --> 00:30:57,510
you know my brother,

488
00:30:57,510 --> 00:30:58,550
he's just a quiet person.

489
00:30:58,550 --> 00:31:00,750
He likes to keep everything to himself.

490
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:04,400
Every year, we really want to celebrate his birthday for him.

491
00:31:05,550 --> 00:31:09,070
Actually, I think as long as he's happy, that's all that matters.

492
00:31:09,070 --> 00:31:10,670
If he really doesn't want to,

493
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:12,210
we shouldn't force him.

494
00:31:12,350 --> 00:31:13,880
But this year is different.

495
00:31:14,030 --> 00:31:15,440
We have you now, sister-in-law.

496
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:17,440
Why don't we give it a try?

497
00:31:22,160 --> 00:31:23,220
Sister-in-law...

498
00:31:35,270 --> 00:31:36,400
Unless it's urgent,

499
00:31:36,550 --> 00:31:37,950
please leave me be today.

500
00:31:38,590 --> 00:31:39,390
What's wrong?

501
00:31:39,510 --> 00:31:40,440
Am I not welcome?

502
00:31:47,350 --> 00:31:48,550
What brings you here?

503
00:31:49,240 --> 00:31:50,920
It's my first time at Wangquan Manor.

504
00:31:50,920 --> 00:31:53,440
Shouldn't Young Master Wangquan be a good host

505
00:31:53,440 --> 00:31:54,400
and show me around?

506
00:31:54,400 --> 00:31:55,270
Of course.

507
00:32:16,440 --> 00:32:17,200
Hongye,

508
00:32:19,750 --> 00:32:23,080
why haven't you celebrated your birthday for so many years?

509
00:32:27,390 --> 00:32:29,050
I've been waiting for someone

510
00:32:29,300 --> 00:32:38,620
[Unparalleled Sword]

511
00:32:30,590 --> 00:32:32,020
and a belated blessing.

512
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:45,960
Father,

513
00:32:49,230 --> 00:32:50,230
you called for me?

514
00:32:54,270 --> 00:32:55,730
I never thought you'd have

515
00:32:55,960 --> 00:32:58,640
your coming-of-age ceremony so soon.

516
00:33:00,030 --> 00:33:01,560
It's still three days away.

517
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:03,440
Yes.

518
00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:06,540
I've memorized the ceremony speech.

519
00:33:08,110 --> 00:33:10,040
Now that the ceremony is complete,

520
00:33:10,200 --> 00:33:11,640
I hope from this day forward...

521
00:33:11,640 --> 00:33:12,310
Father,

522
00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:15,270
you should save those words for three days later

523
00:33:15,270 --> 00:33:17,730
when you personally place the cap on my head.

524
00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:20,320
You're right.

525
00:33:21,350 --> 00:33:22,610
I'm getting confused.

526
00:33:23,070 --> 00:33:24,530
I'll wait for you to return

527
00:33:25,030 --> 00:33:26,310
to perform my coming-of-age ceremony

528
00:33:26,310 --> 00:33:27,840
and celebrate my birthday.

529
00:33:30,690 --> 00:33:31,370
Alright.

530
00:33:37,480 --> 00:33:39,400
So this blessing for the coming-of-age ceremony

531
00:33:39,400 --> 00:33:40,800
became a knot in my heart.

532
00:33:42,160 --> 00:33:43,110
Of course,

533
00:33:43,570 --> 00:33:44,840
it was also to keep

534
00:33:45,290 --> 00:33:47,690
the hope that my father could still return.

535
00:33:55,680 --> 00:33:56,650
However,

536
00:33:57,620 --> 00:33:59,590
though I lost a family member,

537
00:33:59,960 --> 00:34:00,750
now

538
00:34:01,480 --> 00:34:03,690
I have the Mask Group as my new family,

539
00:34:06,130 --> 00:34:06,820
and you.

540
00:34:08,840 --> 00:34:11,000
So when I think about it, all of this

541
00:34:13,120 --> 00:34:14,719
is truly worth celebrating.

542
00:34:18,469 --> 00:34:20,030
Have you all finished listening?

543
00:34:20,030 --> 00:34:22,710
If you don't come out now, there won't be any food left

544
00:34:22,710 --> 00:34:23,639
or wine to drink.

545
00:34:47,810 --> 00:34:48,560
Hongye,

546
00:34:49,040 --> 00:34:51,330
when did you notice us?

547
00:34:51,440 --> 00:34:53,300
Next time, hide your feet better.

548
00:34:54,530 --> 00:34:56,880
My brother and I hid pretty well, didn't we?

549
00:34:56,880 --> 00:34:58,760
Who wears red clothes when hiding?

550
00:34:58,760 --> 00:34:59,450
Hongye,

551
00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:01,840
I did well turning into a rock, right?

552
00:35:01,920 --> 00:35:03,670
You think I wouldn't notice a new rock

553
00:35:03,670 --> 00:35:05,470
in our courtyard out of nowhere?

554
00:35:06,540 --> 00:35:07,410
And you, Yitan.

555
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:10,730
You must have encouraged Huaizhu, right?

556
00:35:11,010 --> 00:35:11,990
No,

557
00:35:12,630 --> 00:35:15,160
we just had the same idea as Mrs. Wangquan.

558
00:35:18,110 --> 00:35:19,510
What about the other two?

559
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:22,280
Although they couldn't make it here,

560
00:35:22,280 --> 00:35:23,610

570

and there are no gifts for me?

571
00:36:07,580 --> 00:36:08,340
Hongye,

572
00:36:08,510 --> 00:36:10,710
you didn't say you wanted to celebrate.

573
00:36:18,210 --> 00:36:20,540

579
00:36:37,250 --> 00:36:38,780
but I can't give you a scare?

580
00:36:40,230 --> 00:36:40,890
Never mind.
