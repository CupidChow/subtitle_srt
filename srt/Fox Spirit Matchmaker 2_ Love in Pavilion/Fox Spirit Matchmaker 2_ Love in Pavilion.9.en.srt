00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:05,790
Huaizhu!

4
00:02:05,790 --> 00:02:06,650
So you're back!

5
00:02:10,030 --> 00:02:11,230
What are you drawing?

6
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:19,290
Are you missing your masked crush?

7
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:22,960
But has it ever occurred to you—

8
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:24,630
what if this man's real face

9
00:02:24,630 --> 00:02:25,840
under the mask

10
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:26,710
is even uglier?

11
00:02:29,310 --> 00:02:30,430
I doubt it.

12
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:37,670
Girls do drift away as they grow up.

13
00:02:37,750 --> 00:02:40,079
You're already taking his side against us.

14
00:02:40,079 --> 00:02:41,590
Dongfang Qinlan!

15
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:46,800
Huaizhu, just go ahead.

16
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:50,400
Hope this can cheer you up a bit.

17
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:53,450
I haven't seen you smile in a while.

18
00:02:58,130 --> 00:03:00,600
I know you're teasing me to cheer me up.

19
00:03:01,990 --> 00:03:02,980
I'm fine.

20
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:05,420
It's late. You may go hit the sack.

21
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:16,120
But on second thought,

22
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:17,560
maybe the question I just asked

23
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:19,220
isn't really a problem at all.

24
00:03:19,420 --> 00:03:22,079
If he's really that ugly,

25
00:03:22,079 --> 00:03:24,480
you can just have him
wear the mask forever.

26
00:03:26,030 --> 00:03:27,160

What brings you here
so early in the morning?

31
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:58,490
You've been down since your return

32
00:03:58,579 --> 00:03:59,810
from the Yang family,

33
00:04:00,310 --> 00:04:02,560
often having trouble sleeping at night.

34
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:04,560
I couldn't bear to see you like this.

35
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:08,960
I used the scale from a carp demon

36
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:10,290
to make this accessory.

37
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:12,560
Wear it,

38
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:14,840
and it'll help clear your mind
and get inner peace.

39
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:16,510
You plucked his scale by force?

40
00:04:16,510 --> 00:04:17,310
Yeah.

I can either kill

44
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:53,650
or torture them as I please.

Dongfang Huaizhu,

00:04:56,750 --> 00:04:58,390
when I become powerful,

47
00:04:59,310 --> 00:05:01,450

I didn't want to disturb you.

The porcelain bottle contains the tonic
to calm the mind and stabilize the pregnancy.

Take one pill each morning and evening.

Why don't you meet her face-to-face?

77
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:02,290
She's my classmate and my good friend.

78
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:04,540
The day she cut her hair and left home,

79
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:07,600
she was determined
to leave everything behind.

80
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:11,270
I respect her decision,

81
00:08:12,860 --> 00:08:14,790
and I also feel guilty towards her.

82
00:08:15,550 --> 00:08:18,730
I don't want our meeting to remind her

83
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:21,850
of the past memories and upset her.

84
00:08:23,070 --> 00:08:24,530
But this isn't your fault.

85
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:28,160
I mean,

86
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:29,800
perhaps.

87
00:08:32,110 --> 00:08:33,150
No matter what,

88
00:08:34,030 --> 00:08:35,960
the dead cannot be brought back to life.

89
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:39,390
Some things are beyond redemption.

Let's go have a drink.

91
00:08:54,910 --> 00:08:56,840
This wine tastes good, doesn't it?

92
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:00,100
You've finished most of it alone.

93
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:05,550
Sorry.

94
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:08,360
It must be boring.

95
00:09:09,030 --> 00:09:10,200
I asked you to keep me company,

96
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:12,580
yet I've been drinking
without saying a word.

97
00:09:12,580 --> 00:09:13,970
I'm always here when you

98
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:15,300
feel like talking.

99
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:23,300
Have you ever experienced

100
00:09:24,550 --> 00:09:28,360
something you could do nothing about
no matter how hard you tried?

101
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:31,580
Yes, of course.

102
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:35,240
What was it?

103
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:40,000
I once helped a little boy.

104
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:41,840
I promised to fulfill

105
00:09:42,390 --> 00:09:44,390
one of his wishes on his birthday.

106
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:48,450
He asked me to take him fly on the sword.

107
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:52,240
But you know how speedy sword flying is.

108
00:09:52,390 --> 00:09:54,050
He couldn't control himself.

109
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:55,670
He...

110
00:09:56,670 --> 00:09:57,870
What happened to him?

111
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:00,270
He peed on me.

112
00:10:03,740 --> 00:10:04,790
And then?

113
00:10:05,790 --> 00:10:06,720
Then,

114
00:10:07,070 --> 00:10:09,330
I went to a clothing shop
to buy a new suit.

115
00:10:10,150 --> 00:10:12,650
The shopkeeper was so nice.
He pulled me aside

116
00:10:12,650 --> 00:10:14,490
and said this kind of thing was normal.

117
00:10:14,490 --> 00:10:16,250
I asked what was normal.

118
00:10:16,390 --> 00:10:17,720
Turned out he meant

119
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:19,550
my failure

120
00:10:19,870 --> 00:10:21,870
to hold it while flying on the sword.

121
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:27,650
That is indeed something
you could do nothing about.

122
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:28,800
Come on.

123
00:10:41,790 --> 00:10:42,630
Thank you.

124
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:46,220
Thank you for keeping me company.

125
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,800
Actually, I've also heard about

126
00:10:52,750 --> 00:10:54,610
what happened to the Yang family.

127
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:02,850
No matter what,
saving people should be the first priority.

128
00:11:05,520 --> 00:11:07,120
Different starting points,

129
00:11:07,810 --> 00:11:09,210
different standpoints.

130
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:12,920
There's no one else to blame.

131
00:11:13,630 --> 00:11:14,440
Besides,

132
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:17,320
everyone did their best.

133
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:25,930
Even Yan, who was hurt the most,

134
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:28,870
has started a new life.

135
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:32,270
And that day,

136
00:11:34,030 --> 00:11:35,270
I watched a snowfall.

137
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,030
Spring is coming

138
00:11:39,870 --> 00:11:41,270
after the melting snow.

139
00:11:52,190 --> 00:11:53,780
A soulmate in life

140
00:11:55,080 --> 00:11:56,340
is as rare and precious

141
00:11:57,840 --> 00:11:58,900
as a golden orchid.

142
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:01,720
Give it a try.

143
00:12:43,620 --> 00:12:44,310
I'm done.

144
00:13:19,550 --> 00:13:21,680
You sent me the gift of a golden orchid,

145
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:25,530
so I should also treat you with sincerity.

146
00:13:27,270 --> 00:13:28,330
Dongfang Huaizhu,

147
00:13:29,910 --> 00:13:31,370
it's me, Wangquan Hongye.

148
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:35,380
Wangquan Hongye?

149
00:13:37,010 --> 00:13:37,800
Why?

150
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:40,400
Well...

151
00:13:48,330 --> 00:13:50,130
At the Yang family's residence,

152
00:13:52,390 --> 00:13:54,920
we said we would never meet again.

153
00:13:57,950 --> 00:13:59,570
Young Master Wangquan,

154
00:14:01,030 --> 00:14:02,310
please stop there.

155
00:14:02,750 --> 00:14:03,600
Huaizhu...

156
00:14:06,840 --> 00:14:09,320
The rendezvous on July 7th,
at the Bamboo Pavilion by River Huai,

157
00:14:09,320 --> 00:14:10,930
let's end it here.

158
00:14:50,080 --> 00:14:50,870
Yitan,

159
00:14:51,670 --> 00:14:53,150
you haven't eaten for days.

160
00:14:53,150 --> 00:14:54,150
I've had the chef

161
00:14:54,150 --> 00:14:56,320
make your favorite small wontons.

162
00:14:59,240 --> 00:15:00,960
Are you still mad at me?

163
00:15:03,910 --> 00:15:05,840
No more carvings.

164
00:15:05,930 --> 00:15:07,070
Indulging in playthings will distract you

165
00:15:07,070 --> 00:15:08,840
and waste your time.

166
00:15:09,750 --> 00:15:11,680
Your grandson has a title outside.

167
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:14,530
I'm known as Mr. Dongli.

168
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:18,420
Each fan I carve is worth
over a hundred taels of silver.

169
00:15:18,870 --> 00:15:20,240
In the first half of this year,

170
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:23,170
our Villa had a deficit
of over 7,000 taels of silver,

171
00:15:24,630 --> 00:15:25,630
and I covered it.

172
00:15:26,330 --> 00:15:28,330
I made it by indulging in playthings

173
00:15:28,550 --> 00:15:30,080
and carving them one by one.

174
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,670
Why have our family's mines
been running at a loss every single year?

175
00:15:33,670 --> 00:15:35,270
Why is the once-great
Clairvoyant Yang family

176
00:15:35,270 --> 00:15:38,030
now just a facade with nothing inside?

177
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:42,090
Do I need to pinpoint every cause, Master?

178
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:43,960
What do you mean by that?

179
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:46,460
You're just trying to piss me off, right?

180
00:15:48,910 --> 00:15:49,600
No, I'm not.

181
00:15:50,750 --> 00:15:52,270
I'm just carving fans

182
00:15:52,670 --> 00:15:54,400
and pondering over something.

183
00:15:54,550 --> 00:15:58,080
Just because of some threats and bribes
from the Nangong family,

184
00:15:58,080 --> 00:16:00,080
you sold my uncle out, Grandfather.

185
00:16:00,630 --> 00:16:02,560
Then how much benefit would it take

186
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,200
for you to sell me out?

187
00:16:04,390 --> 00:16:05,630
Yitan!

188
00:16:05,910 --> 00:16:07,510
You've been an orphan since childhood.

189
00:16:07,510 --> 00:16:09,030
I raised you on my own!

190
00:16:09,030 --> 00:16:10,000
I care for you and love you

191
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,000
all for this?

192
00:16:17,790 --> 00:16:18,550
Care for me?

193
00:16:19,720 --> 00:16:20,550
Love me?

194
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:21,600
You...

195
00:16:21,630 --> 00:16:22,840
Do you know that

196
00:16:23,080 --> 00:16:25,320
to avoid being knocked out by the drug,

197
00:16:26,120 --> 00:16:27,910
my aunt cut her own palm?

198
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:30,310
How much did it hurt?

199
00:16:38,440 --> 00:16:39,660
I want to try it too.

200
00:16:39,690 --> 00:16:40,320
No!

201
00:16:41,840 --> 00:16:42,640
Please don't.

202
00:16:43,790 --> 00:16:44,670
Yitan,

203
00:16:44,840 --> 00:16:48,080
you've had trouble with blood clotting
since childhood.

204
00:16:48,150 --> 00:16:50,670
You really cannot get hurt!

205
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:53,550
So you remember that, Grandfather.

206
00:16:54,200 --> 00:16:55,260
Then let me ask you,

207
00:16:56,510 --> 00:16:59,240
my grandfather who claims
to care for and love me,

208
00:16:59,510 --> 00:17:00,740
how my Clairvoyance

209
00:17:01,750 --> 00:17:02,960
was awakened.

210
00:17:03,390 --> 00:17:03,910
I...

211
00:17:09,240 --> 00:17:10,760
I remember that winter,

212
00:17:11,410 --> 00:17:13,270
when you threw me into the mine,

213
00:17:15,349 --> 00:17:16,770
I was only 12.

214
00:17:25,030 --> 00:17:26,880
It's freezing cold now.

215
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:28,920
How could you feed Yitan the knockout drug

216
00:17:28,920 --> 00:17:31,340
and leave him deep in the mine shaft?

217
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:33,730
No, I must go check on him.

218
00:17:34,110 --> 00:17:34,860
Father,

219
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:37,550
once we Yangs are over 12,

220
00:17:37,550 --> 00:17:39,750
there's no way to awaken Clairvoyance.

221
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:43,060
Yitan is the most talented
in our Yang family.

222
00:17:43,310 --> 00:17:44,400
At this crucial moment,

223
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:45,740
if you don't toughen up,

224
00:17:45,880 --> 00:17:47,880
our Yang family will be done for.

225
00:17:49,310 --> 00:17:50,360
You...

226
00:17:52,750 --> 00:17:56,720
May God bless our Yang family.

227
00:18:11,220 --> 00:18:13,630
[Young Yang Yitan]

228
00:18:15,300 --> 00:18:16,520
Where am I?

229
00:18:17,960 --> 00:18:19,630
How did I get here?

230
00:19:05,570 --> 00:19:06,840
Yitan!

231
00:19:08,440 --> 00:19:09,880
Yitan!

232
00:19:11,830 --> 00:19:14,010
Yitan, where are you?

233
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:15,200
It's...

234
00:19:15,230 --> 00:19:16,700
It's Zui's voice.

235
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:21,880
Zui! Zui... Where are you?

236
00:19:21,910 --> 00:19:24,050
Yitan, I'm here!

237
00:19:26,510 --> 00:19:29,480
Yitan, I've been to your house
to find you.

238
00:19:28,380 --> 00:19:30,670
[Young Wangquan Zui]

239
00:19:29,500 --> 00:19:30,500
I overheard that

240
00:19:30,580 --> 00:19:32,950
your grandfather threw you into the mine.

241
00:19:33,030 --> 00:19:34,550
So I rushed over here.

242
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:39,340
It's way too dangerous.
You need to leave now.

243
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:41,880
I'm not leaving
until you get out of there.

244
00:19:41,960 --> 00:19:43,820
At worst, we'll go down together.

245
00:19:44,110 --> 00:19:45,640
Let's see how your ruthless grandfather

246
00:19:45,640 --> 00:19:47,720
will explain this to our Wangquan family!

247
00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:50,150
Zui, don't talk nonsense.

248
00:19:56,120 --> 00:19:58,220
The mine's on the brink
of a second collapse.

249
00:19:58,220 --> 00:19:59,420
No,

250
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:01,410
this will put Zui in danger.

251
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:03,870
I must figure out a way.

252
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,010
I must.

253
00:20:44,110 --> 00:20:45,000
Zui,

254
00:20:45,830 --> 00:20:48,160
move away! Hurry!

255
00:21:03,160 --> 00:21:04,270
I almost died

256
00:21:05,900 --> 00:21:07,010
at the age of 12.

257
00:21:07,960 --> 00:21:09,240
That's okay,

258
00:21:10,100 --> 00:21:11,940
but I almost lost Zui too.

259
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:14,660
Fortunately, you both made it out alive.

260
00:21:16,530 --> 00:21:17,490
Yeah.

261
00:21:19,550 --> 00:21:21,350
Fortunately, we're both alive.

262
00:21:23,270 --> 00:21:25,600
Thankfully, I awakened my Clairvoyance.

263
00:21:28,830 --> 00:21:29,930
And luckily,

264
00:21:31,350 --> 00:21:33,880
I was in a coma for just a month
after my return.

265
00:21:33,890 --> 00:21:35,790
Everything we did was for your sake.

266
00:21:35,790 --> 00:21:37,110
For my sake? Huh?

267
00:21:38,110 --> 00:21:39,240
What's the benefit?

268
00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:41,440
The Yang family's remaining reputation?

269
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:42,070
Or

270
00:21:42,070 --> 00:21:43,750
your luxurious lifestyles?

271
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:46,750
Yitan,

272
00:21:47,510 --> 00:21:48,880
I am your grandfather!

273
00:21:49,530 --> 00:21:52,060
How could you say
such disrespectful things?

274
00:21:56,590 --> 00:21:58,320
If you weren't my grandfather,

275
00:22:00,310 --> 00:22:02,110
I wouldn't even be here anymore.

276
00:22:03,690 --> 00:22:05,390
Now that my aunt is gone,

277
00:22:05,550 --> 00:22:07,920
the only light
in this decaying Yang family

278
00:22:07,920 --> 00:22:09,380
has already disappeared.

279
00:22:12,160 --> 00:22:13,240
I'm not happy,

280
00:22:15,550 --> 00:22:16,880
and I'm done faking it.

281
00:22:21,500 --> 00:22:22,520
Yitan,

282
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:25,260
Grandfather is long in the tooth.

283
00:22:25,270 --> 00:22:27,640
You can't treat an old man like this.

284
00:22:31,880 --> 00:22:33,610
The fact that I'm still staying
in the Yang family

285
00:22:33,610 --> 00:22:35,270
to maintain this last dignity

286
00:22:36,060 --> 00:22:37,920
is already the last bit of respect

287
00:22:38,110 --> 00:22:39,710
I can show you, Grandfather.

288
00:22:46,270 --> 00:22:47,070
Master,

289
00:22:48,350 --> 00:22:49,410
it's getting late.

290
00:22:49,590 --> 00:22:50,650
You may go back now.

291
00:23:27,790 --> 00:23:29,590
The fact that I'm still staying
in the Yang family

292
00:23:29,590 --> 00:23:31,250
to maintain this last dignity

293
00:23:32,150 --> 00:23:34,010
is already the last bit of respect

294
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:35,800
I can show you, Grandfather.

295
00:23:45,310 --> 00:23:46,640
Did I do anything wrong?

296
00:23:48,920 --> 00:23:50,920
Did I?

297
00:23:55,160 --> 00:23:56,890
For the sake of the Yang family,

298
00:23:59,310 --> 00:24:01,830
for the sake of our ancestral legacy,

299
00:24:01,920 --> 00:24:04,240
what did I do wrong?

300
00:24:08,110 --> 00:24:09,160
Why

301
00:24:10,550 --> 00:24:12,160
do you all treat me like this?

302
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:17,590
Why is everyone leaving me?

303
00:24:32,120 --> 00:24:33,810
Yang Huanzhou.

304
00:24:37,680 --> 00:24:40,160
Nangong Ye is a good-for-nothing.

305
00:24:40,890 --> 00:24:43,200
I'm wondering if you're
any better than him.

306
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:44,200
Who are you?

307
00:24:45,070 --> 00:24:46,650
I am you.

308
00:24:47,070 --> 00:24:48,830
Your frustration,

309
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:49,830
resentment,

310
00:24:50,030 --> 00:24:51,070
and hatred

311
00:24:51,160 --> 00:24:52,750
have created me.

312
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:56,550
Who on earth are you?

313
00:24:57,030 --> 00:24:59,400
Have you ever heard of the prophecy,

314
00:24:59,790 --> 00:25:03,000
"Forsaking emotions, pursuing hatred;
eternal night befalls?"

315
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:04,680
I am the one beyond the Boundary,

316
00:25:04,680 --> 00:25:07,000
destined to rule over everything,

317
00:25:07,550 --> 00:25:08,920
the Eternal Night.

318
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:13,680
Impossible.

319
00:25:14,790 --> 00:25:16,030
You just said

320
00:25:17,400 --> 00:25:19,330
you're still beyond the Boundary.

321
00:25:19,750 --> 00:25:20,510
Yes, indeed.

322
00:25:21,590 --> 00:25:23,200
I am still beyond the Boundary.

323
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:24,600
I still can't get in here.

324
00:25:25,160 --> 00:25:27,550
But I can feel your hatred and grudges.

325
00:25:29,110 --> 00:25:31,550
I communicate with you through them.

326
00:25:32,200 --> 00:25:33,510
You're such a lucky dog

327
00:25:34,070 --> 00:25:36,200
to have been chosen by me.

328
00:25:36,270 --> 00:25:37,030
No!

329
00:25:37,740 --> 00:25:40,140
I'm from a prestigious and righteous sect.

330
00:25:40,550 --> 00:25:43,590
How could I collude with an evil being?

331
00:25:44,270 --> 00:25:45,620
What a coincidence.

332
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:49,350
Nangong Ye once said the same thing.

333
00:25:50,590 --> 00:25:54,590
Back then, the Nangong family had fallen
just like your Yang family now.

334
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:56,030
Nangong Ye

335
00:25:56,030 --> 00:25:59,090
couldn't even take one strike
from Wangquan Shouzhuo.

336
00:26:02,590 --> 00:26:03,720
So you mean

337
00:26:04,440 --> 00:26:06,920
you taught Nangong Ye

338
00:26:08,030 --> 00:26:10,270
the sword-forging technique
by demon cores?

339
00:26:10,270 --> 00:26:11,030
Smart guy.

340
00:26:13,350 --> 00:26:15,160
What can you offer me?

341
00:26:15,300 --> 00:26:16,990
I need power!

342
00:26:17,550 --> 00:26:19,070
I want the power

343
00:26:19,350 --> 00:26:22,720
that's enough for me
to fight against Wangquan Hongye!

344
00:26:29,740 --> 00:26:31,930
[Beast Kingdom]

345
00:26:36,520 --> 00:26:38,750
Young Master, you should have
informed us in advance

346
00:26:38,750 --> 00:26:40,680
of your visit to the Beast Kingdom.

347
00:26:40,680 --> 00:26:43,700
I should have welcomed you
with the proper etiquette.

348
00:26:40,970 --> 00:26:43,110
[Daluoan, King of the Beast Kingdom]

349
00:26:44,160 --> 00:26:45,310
The Beast Kingdom and the Yiqi Alliance

350
00:26:45,310 --> 00:26:47,680
have always maintained
a policy of non-interference.

351
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:49,640
Your kingdom controls demons with talismans.

352
00:26:49,640 --> 00:26:51,420
I have no right to interfere.

353
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:52,570
However, I hope that

354
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:55,470
the demon-controlling talismans
are kept within the Beast Kingdom

355
00:26:55,470 --> 00:26:57,600
and never appear in the Yiqi Alliance.

356
00:27:00,510 --> 00:27:01,350
Young Master,

357
00:27:01,960 --> 00:27:04,400
I don't know what you're talking about.

358
00:27:07,590 --> 00:27:08,400
Good.

359
00:27:13,070 --> 00:27:14,000
I remember

360
00:27:14,100 --> 00:27:15,490
in the Beast Kingdom,

361
00:27:15,720 --> 00:27:19,520
this golden brocade is used
for royal family members' coffins only.

362
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:21,980
I'm not mistaken, am I?

363
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:28,520
Then, Your Majesty, please keep

364
00:27:30,070 --> 00:27:32,330
demon-controlling talismans in check.

365
00:27:57,070 --> 00:27:58,210
The King of the Beast Kingdom

366
00:27:58,210 --> 00:28:01,290
will probably stop selling
demon-controlling talismans.

367
00:28:01,290 --> 00:28:03,110
As for those registered and sold,

368
00:28:03,110 --> 00:28:04,160
it's your job to investigate.

369
00:28:04,160 --> 00:28:04,680
Yes.

370
00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:06,960
Liuyun Pavilion confessed

371
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:08,070
that they recently sold

372
00:28:08,070 --> 00:28:09,640
a talisman that could control a demon king.

373
00:28:09,640 --> 00:28:12,300
The buyer entered
the Beast Kingdom's dungeon.

374
00:28:15,400 --> 00:28:16,600
You can go back first.

375
00:28:17,070 --> 00:28:18,730
Let me investigate it myself.

376
00:28:19,960 --> 00:28:21,360
I'm going to the dungeon.

377
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:24,870
After Young Master Wangquan
reached our kingdom,

378
00:28:24,870 --> 00:28:26,350
he went directly to Liuyun Pavilion.

379
00:28:26,350 --> 00:28:27,320
With just one sword strike,

380
00:28:27,320 --> 00:28:29,250
he cut off the manager's right arm.

381
00:28:29,270 --> 00:28:32,400
So that was indeed
the Liuyun Pavilion manager's blade.

382
00:28:32,750 --> 00:28:33,750
Does it mean

383
00:28:33,790 --> 00:28:34,880
if we don't comply,

384
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:37,240
we'll soon need the brocade for our coffins?

385
00:28:37,240 --> 00:28:39,080
The manager of Liuyun Pavilion?

386
00:28:39,240 --> 00:28:42,070
He was one of the top masters
in our Beast Kingdom.

387
00:28:43,070 --> 00:28:45,320
Are you sure he only struck once?

388
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:48,700
The people and demons
at Liuyun Pavilion all witnessed it.

389
00:28:49,030 --> 00:28:50,430
Whether we like it or not,

390
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:54,900
the plan of using
demon-controlling talismans to infiltrate

391
00:28:56,200 --> 00:28:58,730
the Yiqi Alliance has to be
put on hold for now.

392
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:09,680
I've given you the power you asked for.

393
00:29:10,030 --> 00:29:12,550
You need to do something for me.

394
00:29:12,580 --> 00:29:14,860
Use the method I taught you

395
00:29:14,950 --> 00:29:17,670
to rescue a celestial demon.

396
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:46,450
[The Dungeon's Altar, Beast Kingdom]

397
00:29:57,090 --> 00:29:59,000
Once you get this celestial demon,

398
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:00,570
will you still help me?

399
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:04,900
I must use a demon-controlling talisman

400
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:07,270
to become this celestial demon's master

401
00:30:08,870 --> 00:30:11,160
and make him work for me.

402
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:29,200
They're using the dragon's breath
to reinforce the seal.

403
00:30:29,350 --> 00:30:31,240
How powerful this great demon is?

404
00:30:32,350 --> 00:30:33,440
Very good.

405
00:30:33,960 --> 00:30:35,200
From now on,

406
00:30:35,680 --> 00:30:37,690
you are my slave.

407
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:43,490
Who on earth are you?

408
00:30:44,200 --> 00:30:47,400
Why did you come here
with a demon-controlling talisman?

409
00:30:48,550 --> 00:30:50,830
You came at the right time.

410
00:30:55,680 --> 00:30:57,150
Wangquan Hongye,

411
00:30:58,030 --> 00:31:00,680
fate has brought us to meet again.

412
00:31:01,240 --> 00:31:02,330
You know me?

413
00:31:02,680 --> 00:31:05,900
I was once just like an ant
beneath your feet,

414
00:31:06,510 --> 00:31:07,830
but today,

415
00:31:07,860 --> 00:31:10,600
I'll show you what I've got!

416
00:31:43,860 --> 00:31:45,470
From this moment on,

417
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:49,070
you are a slave manipulated
by my evil thoughts.

418
00:31:53,440 --> 00:31:54,960
I am your slave.

419
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:56,880
Go

420
00:31:57,510 --> 00:32:00,110
pull out the dragon bone behind me.

421
00:32:01,880 --> 00:32:03,160
Pull it out.

422
00:32:57,750 --> 00:32:59,570
Still resisting?

423
00:33:01,830 --> 00:33:03,590
Let me help you.

424
00:33:30,510 --> 00:33:33,640
Use your mana to inject
this sub-talisman into his body.

425
00:33:53,380 --> 00:33:54,980
Why don't you do it yourself?

426
00:33:56,720 --> 00:33:57,920
You're afraid of him.

427
00:34:01,420 --> 00:34:03,920
Hurry! Inject it into his body!

428
00:34:19,840 --> 00:34:23,610
Demons can be killed, slain,

429
00:34:24,620 --> 00:34:26,489
but must not be enslaved.

430
00:34:29,170 --> 00:34:29,920
You...

431
00:34:31,230 --> 00:34:32,960
Resisting the evil curse,

432
00:34:32,980 --> 00:34:34,840
you'll surely suffer a backlash!

433
00:34:52,920 --> 00:34:54,190
Demons can be killed

434
00:34:54,920 --> 00:34:56,760
but must not be enslaved.

435
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:58,670
Well said.

436
00:35:04,740 --> 00:35:06,670
[Jiuhuo]
[Celestial Demon of the Netherworld Clan]

437
00:35:20,920 --> 00:35:21,760
Please spare me!

438
00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:22,680
Spare my life!

439
00:35:22,710 --> 00:35:24,140
Mere nonentity,

440
00:35:24,630 --> 00:35:26,990
how dare you try to control me?

441
00:35:27,170 --> 00:35:28,990
Who sent you?

442
00:35:29,590 --> 00:35:32,030
It was Lady Black Fox.

443
00:35:40,390 --> 00:35:41,700
Lord Jiuhuo.

444
00:35:43,530 --> 00:35:44,710
Lord Jiuhuo,

445
00:35:45,230 --> 00:35:47,290
don't you recognize Jia Lan anymore?

446
00:35:47,810 --> 00:35:48,850
Jia Lan?

447
00:35:50,230 --> 00:35:51,510
Is it you?

448
00:35:52,600 --> 00:35:54,630
This is just a small avatar of me,

449
00:35:54,690 --> 00:35:57,090
existing on the hatred in people's hearts.

450
00:35:58,460 --> 00:35:59,940
The real Jia Lan

451
00:36:01,060 --> 00:36:03,120
is still sealed beyond the Boundary.

452
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:08,140
Jia Lan,

453
00:36:08,590 --> 00:36:10,850
I didn't expect you to end up in this form.

454
00:36:11,190 --> 00:36:12,510
Lord Jiuhuo,

455
00:36:13,230 --> 00:36:14,760
I was set up by some wicked men

456
00:36:14,760 --> 00:36:16,440
and lost my body.

457
00:36:16,920 --> 00:36:17,840
Lord Jiuhuo,

458
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:19,930
please break the Boundary.

459
00:36:20,030 --> 00:36:22,290
I've been waiting for you for 500 years

460
00:36:22,440 --> 00:36:24,230
in solitude and darkness.

461
00:36:25,360 --> 00:36:26,240
Don't worry.

462
00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:29,110
I will help you

463
00:36:29,800 --> 00:36:31,840
reclaim everything you've lost.

464
00:36:33,070 --> 00:36:34,680
You want the Eternal Night?

465
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:37,140
Then Eternal Night shall befall.

466
00:36:38,040 --> 00:36:39,510
Go to Divine Fire Villa.

467
00:36:39,540 --> 00:36:40,780
Go find her.

468
00:36:41,490 --> 00:36:42,970
I've lost my body,

469
00:36:43,310 --> 00:36:46,800
but she will be the perfect vessel for me.

470
00:36:47,320 --> 00:36:48,070
She?

471
00:36:48,670 --> 00:36:50,320
The moment you see her,

472
00:36:50,670 --> 00:36:52,530
you will understand everything.

473
00:36:53,760 --> 00:36:54,840
Lord Jiuhuo,

474
00:36:55,530 --> 00:36:57,070
I need this fool

475
00:36:57,220 --> 00:36:58,910
for other uses.

476
00:36:59,360 --> 00:37:00,980
Please spare his life for now.
