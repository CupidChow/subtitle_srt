00:16:15,740 --> 00:16:17,890
I'm just afraid you'll have the luck to get there

193
00:16:17,890 --> 00:16:19,010
but not to return.

194
00:16:19,940 --> 00:16:20,980
I'll go with you.

195
00:16:23,130 --> 00:16:25,460
I can't be more than 10 steps away from you.

196
00:16:25,940 --> 00:16:26,620
That works.

197
00:16:34,820 --> 00:16:36,580
What are you up to now?

198
00:16:37,460 --> 00:16:40,020
[Lady Poison from Nanchui]

199
00:16:38,290 --> 00:16:39,620
I promised you, my dear,

200
00:16:40,290 --> 00:16:41,860
that after you recovered from your injuries,

201
00:16:41,860 --> 00:16:43,250
I would give you a gift.

202
00:16:44,100 --> 00:16:45,650
We're not even married.

203
00:16:45,770 --> 00:16:47,130
Who's your dear?

204
00:16:48,010 --> 00:16:49,980
If you see this gift,

205
00:16:50,770 --> 00:16:52,650
you'll surely agree to marry me.

206
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:08,440
[Star-Picking Tower, Nanchui]

207
00:17:13,170 --> 00:17:15,130
I've only been to your home three times.

208
00:17:15,130 --> 00:17:17,190
I couldn't remember all the details.

209
00:17:17,619 --> 00:17:18,390
But I found

210
00:17:18,410 --> 00:17:20,810
the blueprints of your family's building.

211
00:17:20,970 --> 00:17:22,369
This Star-Picking Tower

212
00:17:22,730 --> 00:17:25,460
should be exactly the same as your home back then.

213
00:18:27,620 --> 00:18:30,120
[Nangong Chui, Young Master of Nangong Family, Yiqi Alliance]

214
00:18:28,770 --> 00:18:30,730
Kill!

215
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:36,520
You're remembering painful memories again, aren't you?

216
00:18:41,080 --> 00:18:44,280
Our clan leader was obsessed with building towers.

217
00:18:45,180 --> 00:18:48,370
Sometimes he would steal timber from the Nangong family.

218
00:18:48,370 --> 00:18:50,890
But we never killed any of them.

219
00:18:51,450 --> 00:18:52,710
I don't understand...

220
00:18:55,410 --> 00:18:57,170
Why did the Nangong family

221
00:18:58,090 --> 00:18:59,750
exterminate our entire clan?

222
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:06,900
Let me show you something.

223
00:19:11,080 --> 00:19:14,450
I captured people from the Nangong family to build the Star-Picking Tower.

224
00:19:14,450 --> 00:19:15,600
After it was built,

225
00:19:15,630 --> 00:19:17,140
I killed them all

226
00:19:18,450 --> 00:19:20,210
and used their bones and weapons

227
00:19:20,210 --> 00:19:21,270
to make bone bells.

228
00:19:22,210 --> 00:19:23,210
Do you like it?

229
00:19:24,410 --> 00:19:26,450
You killed so many people from the Nangong family.

230
00:19:26,450 --> 00:19:28,840
There are even more on the cliff outside the tower.

231
00:19:28,840 --> 00:19:30,250
Nangong Ye's head

232
00:19:30,360 --> 00:19:32,600
will hang up here too one day.

233
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:36,360
But won't doing this bring trouble?

234
00:19:36,560 --> 00:19:37,560
Of course it will.

235
00:19:42,460 --> 00:19:44,320
So you are the Hundred-Eyed Demon Lord?

236
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:45,500
Who are you two?

237
00:19:45,640 --> 00:19:48,370
How dare you trespass Nanchui's forbidden area?

238
00:20:06,730 --> 00:20:08,360
Your skills are quite impressive.

239
00:20:08,360 --> 00:20:10,090
You're from the Yiqi Alliance.

240
00:20:38,770 --> 00:20:40,370
You dare to hurt Lady Poison?

241
00:20:41,320 --> 00:20:43,640
You really must be tired of living.

242
00:21:02,030 --> 00:21:03,360
Hundred-Eyed Barrier?

243
00:21:04,130 --> 00:21:06,560
Hundred-Eyed Demon Lord, the Spider Demon King of Nanchui,

244
00:21:06,560 --> 00:21:07,840
has a body full of golden eyes.

245
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:09,690
Each golden eye has 100 years of cultivation

246
00:21:09,690 --> 00:21:10,800
and has strong demonic energy.

247
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:11,800
Able to seize souls,

248
00:21:11,800 --> 00:21:13,250
he dominates Nanchui.

249
00:21:14,010 --> 00:21:16,880
But today, the descendant of the Dongfang Divine Fire is here.

250
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:18,540
Your kryptonite has arrived.

251
00:21:31,920 --> 00:21:32,950
Demon Lord!

252
00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:37,940
What magical artifact did you use

253
00:21:37,970 --> 00:21:40,370
to destroy my thousand-year demonic eyes?

254
00:21:41,530 --> 00:21:44,360
It's just a handful of Miss Dongfang's hair.

255
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:47,410
Dongfang Divine Fire...

256
00:21:52,170 --> 00:21:53,450
Take care, everyone.

257
00:21:53,930 --> 00:21:55,770
We do good deeds without leaving our names.

258
00:21:55,770 --> 00:21:57,600
If you insist on remembering our kindness,

259
00:21:57,600 --> 00:22:02,460
just remember to spread the word about the two young heroines from the Dongfang family.

260
00:22:02,490 --> 00:22:03,600
Thank you, thank you.

261
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:04,170
It's nothing.

262
00:22:04,170 --> 00:22:05,630
We saved all these people.

263
00:22:05,880 --> 00:22:07,280
We dealt with all those bad guys.

264
00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:09,940
Masked brother, are you trying to steal my credit?

265
00:22:09,940 --> 00:22:10,530
You...

266
00:22:10,970 --> 00:22:11,850
No.

267
00:22:12,040 --> 00:22:15,040
Of course, the young heroine from the Dongfang family deserve all the credit.

268
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:15,880
See?

269
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:19,600
This masked brother has a beautiful heart and face.

270
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:24,220
Let's stay here

271
00:22:24,280 --> 00:22:26,580
and wait for my sister and your big brother to return.

272
00:22:26,580 --> 00:22:27,840
We'll wait patiently.

273
00:22:27,990 --> 00:22:29,790
Let them face the enemy together

274
00:22:29,880 --> 00:22:32,280
and give them a chance to develop their feelings.

275
00:22:32,280 --> 00:22:35,210
The Demon Lord built this Star-Picking Tower for me.

276
00:22:35,320 --> 00:22:37,780
If you insist on paying with someone's life,

277
00:22:38,010 --> 00:22:39,510
then take mine.

278
00:22:39,640 --> 00:22:40,410
Lady Poison.

279
00:22:43,160 --> 00:22:45,090
Humans are the most cold-blooded.

280
00:22:45,250 --> 00:22:47,510
Talking to them about loyalty and reason

281
00:22:47,690 --> 00:22:48,560
is futile.

282
00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:50,880
Even if you have a long-standing grudge against the Yiqi Alliance,

283
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:52,700
those civilians you kidnapped

284
00:22:52,930 --> 00:22:54,040
were innocent.

285
00:22:57,550 --> 00:22:58,780
Innocent?

286
00:23:00,840 --> 00:23:02,410
Do you know how many of my people

287
00:23:02,410 --> 00:23:05,010
originally lived in this Star-Picking Tower?

288
00:23:05,970 --> 00:23:08,830
Four thousand eight hundred and seventy-one.

289
00:23:09,040 --> 00:23:10,490
During that massacre,

290
00:23:11,410 --> 00:23:13,250
fire burned for seven days.

291
00:23:14,150 --> 00:23:16,480
Their bodies were completely destroyed.

292
00:23:16,560 --> 00:23:18,080
Were they guilty?

293
00:23:29,010 --> 00:23:29,820
Sister,

294
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:30,980
go!

295
00:23:38,010 --> 00:23:39,320
My parents,

296
00:23:39,450 --> 00:23:42,450
and my brother who had only transformed for 10 days...

297
00:23:43,640 --> 00:23:45,090
Were they guilty?

298
00:23:45,210 --> 00:23:47,030
What crime did we commit?

299
00:23:47,320 --> 00:23:48,210
Our crime

300
00:23:49,530 --> 00:23:50,770
was merely cutting down

301
00:23:50,770 --> 00:23:53,170
one of Master Nangong's Golden Nanmu tree.

302
00:23:53,970 --> 00:23:56,430
It was his precious wood for making coffins.

303
00:23:57,170 --> 00:23:58,980
It's just a box for the dead,

304
00:23:59,080 --> 00:24:00,780
yet it cost us 5,000 lives.

305
00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:03,040
In the eyes of you humans,

306
00:24:03,300 --> 00:24:04,770
being born a demon

307
00:24:05,930 --> 00:24:07,410
is our crime.

308
00:24:10,970 --> 00:24:12,170
When I kill humans,

309
00:24:12,690 --> 00:24:13,800
I'm cruel.

310
00:24:14,800 --> 00:24:16,640
Lady Poison's clan was peaceful

311
00:24:17,090 --> 00:24:18,340
and was slaughtered.

312
00:24:18,800 --> 00:24:20,000
If I have to choose...

313
00:24:23,180 --> 00:24:24,660
I'll choose cruelty.

314
00:24:25,930 --> 00:24:27,800
When the Yiqi Alliance attacks Nanchui,

315
00:24:27,800 --> 00:24:29,730
and the demons in your territory die miserably,

316
00:24:29,730 --> 00:24:31,170
can you truly bear

317
00:24:31,530 --> 00:24:33,280
such a heavy price?

318
00:24:36,800 --> 00:24:38,180
[To the Yiqi Alliance Leader]

319
00:24:39,010 --> 00:24:40,620
This is Nangong Ye's

320
00:24:40,040 --> 00:24:40,770
[Hundred-Eyed Demon Lord of Star-Picking Tower in Nanchui led his demons to kill and capture Nanchui civilians]

321
00:24:40,690 --> 00:24:41,880
request to the leader of the Yiqi Alliance

322
00:24:40,840 --> 00:24:44,060
[Alliance Leader, please allow us to mobilize the forces of Yiqi Alliance to attack Nanchui and purge the demons. From Nangong Ye.]

323
00:24:41,880 --> 00:24:43,530
to attack Nanchui?

324
00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:45,640
The Nangong family, for the sake of a coffin,

325
00:24:45,640 --> 00:24:47,770
massacred Lady Poison's entire clan.

326
00:24:48,010 --> 00:24:49,840
You've killed so many of his people.

327
00:24:49,840 --> 00:24:51,080
Do you think this

328
00:24:51,110 --> 00:24:53,770
isn't enough for all of Nanchui to pay with their lives?

329
00:24:53,770 --> 00:24:55,040
Who exactly are you?

330
00:24:56,410 --> 00:24:58,250
And where did this document come from?

331
00:24:58,250 --> 00:24:59,490
That's not important.

332
00:24:59,490 --> 00:25:02,140
What's important is whether you believe it or not.

333
00:25:02,140 --> 00:25:04,600
The Nangong family has absolute power in the Yiqi Alliance.

334
00:25:04,600 --> 00:25:06,430
Every word in this document

335
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:08,130
will become reality.

336
00:25:08,210 --> 00:25:10,170
You may not be afraid of the Nangong family,

337
00:25:10,170 --> 00:25:13,570
but what if the entire elite force of the Yiqi Alliance comes?

338
00:25:21,800 --> 00:25:23,080
You came to find me

339
00:25:23,770 --> 00:25:25,220
just to say these things?

340
00:25:25,280 --> 00:25:25,930
No.

341
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:29,080
I came to kill you,

342
00:25:29,610 --> 00:25:31,070
Hundred-Eyed Demon Lord.

343
00:25:31,490 --> 00:25:34,040
If I were to use your demon core to save your Nanchui,

344
00:25:34,040 --> 00:25:34,570
would you

345
00:25:35,010 --> 00:25:36,010
dare give it t ome?

346
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:38,600
How could a human possibly save demons?

347
00:25:38,600 --> 00:25:40,280
The Nangong family is not innocent,

348
00:25:40,280 --> 00:25:42,410
and neither are you, Hundred-Eyed Demon Lord.

349
00:25:42,410 --> 00:25:43,560
The ones I want to save

350
00:25:43,560 --> 00:25:46,220
are the innocent ones mentioned by Lady Poison.

351
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:47,580
I hope their brethren,

352
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:48,570
their parents,

353
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:51,170
their younger siblings who have just transformed,

354
00:25:51,170 --> 00:25:51,930
won't die.

355
00:25:56,880 --> 00:25:58,010
Although I am human,

356
00:25:58,600 --> 00:25:59,840
not every human

357
00:26:00,790 --> 00:26:01,940
is like Nangong.

358
00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:11,170
Audacious humans,

359
00:26:11,280 --> 00:26:14,140
how dare you cause trouble in my Nanchui territory?

360
00:26:14,770 --> 00:26:18,170
Have you considered the consequences of being obliterated?

361
00:26:18,560 --> 00:26:21,230
This demonic energy is far stronger than the Hundred-Eyed Demon Lord's.

362
00:26:21,230 --> 00:26:22,840
It's the Nanchui Poison King.

363
00:26:22,840 --> 00:26:24,500
Quickly, leave the building!

364
00:26:32,680 --> 00:26:35,100
[Huandu Qingtian, Nanchui Poison King]

365
00:26:38,380 --> 00:26:39,850
With such demonic aura,

366
00:26:40,250 --> 00:26:42,490
may I ask if you are the Nanchui Poison King,

367
00:26:42,490 --> 00:26:43,950
Huandu Qingtian?

368
00:26:44,010 --> 00:26:46,440
Causing trouble in my Nanchui territory,

369
00:26:46,840 --> 00:26:50,370
you even dared to touch my nephew, the Hundred-Eyed Demon Lord.

370
00:26:50,450 --> 00:26:51,010
You,

371
00:26:51,280 --> 00:26:52,360
and you,

372
00:26:52,730 --> 00:26:53,820
must all die.

373
00:26:57,560 --> 00:26:59,400
Such strong demonic energy.

374
00:26:59,490 --> 00:27:01,550
Is this the Hundred-Eyed Demon Lord?

375
00:27:01,890 --> 00:27:03,320
Is he this powerful?

376
00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:04,220
Miss Dongfang,

377
00:27:04,800 --> 00:27:06,080
please stay here.

378
00:27:08,220 --> 00:27:09,060
Be careful!

379
00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:26,800
Dongfang Divine Fire!

380
00:27:30,040 --> 00:27:31,770
Let me borrow your Divine Fire.

381
00:27:48,680 --> 00:27:50,030
Young one,

382
00:27:50,340 --> 00:27:51,540
you have some skills.

383
00:27:51,750 --> 00:27:53,480
But compared to me,

384
00:27:53,750 --> 00:27:54,550
you're still two

385
00:27:54,550 --> 00:27:57,480
or 3,000 years of cultivation and experience short.

386
00:28:00,820 --> 00:28:02,270
Retreat quickly.

387
00:28:02,350 --> 00:28:05,180
You can't take my nephew's demon core away.

388
00:28:05,480 --> 00:28:07,400
Come out now, or are you seeking death?

389
00:28:07,400 --> 00:28:08,500
Coming!

390
00:28:10,070 --> 00:28:11,000
Fourth Brother,

391
00:28:11,150 --> 00:28:12,820
the swords you make are getting worse.

392
00:28:12,820 --> 00:28:13,750
Big Brother,

393
00:28:13,880 --> 00:28:14,920
be reasonable.

394
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:17,720
This sword could block one attack from old Huandu.

395
00:28:17,720 --> 00:28:18,720
It's good enough.

396
00:28:18,920 --> 00:28:21,350
This Nanchui Poison King's toxic miasma has been refined for 1,000 years.

397
00:28:21,350 --> 00:28:22,750
It's indeed formidable.

398
00:28:23,310 --> 00:28:24,440
If that's the case,

399
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:27,320
let's fight our way out.

400
00:28:27,480 --> 00:28:29,160
Such big words.

401
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:31,960
Let's see

402
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:34,330
if you can break through this move of mine.

403
00:28:37,830 --> 00:28:39,530
Third Brother, help me out.

404
00:28:39,680 --> 00:28:40,440
I'm coming!

405
00:28:55,130 --> 00:28:55,810
Freeze!

406
00:28:58,030 --> 00:28:58,870
As expected.

407
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:00,640
Even with a body of all poisons,

408
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:02,400
it still operates on the basis of qi circulation.

409
00:29:02,400 --> 00:29:03,720
As long as we lock the qi channels,

410
00:29:03,720 --> 00:29:06,030
we can temporarily restrain the old demon's attacks.

411
00:29:06,030 --> 00:29:06,960
Old Huandu,

412
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:08,860
what other tricks do you have?

413
00:29:09,240 --> 00:29:10,400
Ignorant fools.

414
00:29:13,310 --> 00:29:14,390
Again?

415
00:29:14,800 --> 00:29:16,670
How many more tricks do you have?

416
00:29:19,510 --> 00:29:21,370
Fourth Brother, draw your sword!

417
00:29:21,480 --> 00:29:22,180
Seal!

418
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:22,750
Break!

419
00:29:23,270 --> 00:29:24,070
Spirit Shell,

420
00:29:24,110 --> 00:29:24,860
open!

421
00:29:25,300 --> 00:29:26,960
Big Brother, catch the sword!

422
00:29:29,960 --> 00:29:30,690
This is good.

423
00:29:30,790 --> 00:29:32,050
It'll be my main sword.

424
00:29:32,940 --> 00:29:33,820
Big Brother,

425
00:29:34,030 --> 00:29:35,520
here's a bottle of wine.

426
00:29:35,750 --> 00:29:36,880
You understand me.

427
00:29:40,790 --> 00:29:42,240
Miss, stay calm.

428
00:29:42,350 --> 00:29:43,870
Although I don't know if it will work,

429
00:29:43,870 --> 00:29:45,440
let me give it my all first.

430
00:29:58,480 --> 00:29:59,680
The spirit swords have merged.

431
00:29:59,680 --> 00:30:01,200
Just one more breakthrough to go.

432
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:04,450
Then I'll break through your Xuanwu position first.

433
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:11,110
Third Brother, Fourth Brother,

434
00:30:11,110 --> 00:30:12,260
take the lady and leave first.
