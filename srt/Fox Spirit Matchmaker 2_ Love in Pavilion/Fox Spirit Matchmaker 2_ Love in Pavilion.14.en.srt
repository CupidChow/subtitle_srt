[Love in Pavilion]

00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:50,840
[Episode 14]

3
00:02:42,620 --> 00:02:44,940
You let the leech demon escape.

4
00:02:45,310 --> 00:02:46,610
You deserve death!

5
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:53,090
Who are you?

6
00:02:53,260 --> 00:02:55,190
Why did you slaughter the village?

7
00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:01,710
Looks like

8
00:03:01,710 --> 00:03:03,430
you're that busybody.

9
00:03:04,430 --> 00:03:07,240
I'm Ye Yuan, the Right Guardian of Sky City.

10
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:09,310
Where is that leech demon?

11
00:03:09,370 --> 00:03:10,490
I don't know.

12
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:14,770
Let's go.

13
00:03:22,210 --> 00:03:23,740
You showed up yourself.

14
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:24,900
Perfect.

15
00:03:25,579 --> 00:03:26,940
Focus on your core.

16
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:28,550
Guide your qi through Chonglou,

17
00:03:28,550 --> 00:03:30,750
then through Jianggong to Mingtang.

18
00:03:32,910 --> 00:03:33,710
Who's there?

19
00:03:34,010 --> 00:03:36,140
Young man, just do as I say.

20
00:03:36,170 --> 00:03:37,460
Who's there?

21
00:03:42,750 --> 00:03:45,150
You can see
his demonic aura now, can't you?

22
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:07,930
It's you guys.

23
00:04:08,110 --> 00:04:09,240
Who else could it be?

24
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:15,580
Zui, don't pursue a desperate enemy.

25
00:04:15,790 --> 00:04:17,120
He's not our priority anyway.

26
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:18,000
He got off easy.

27
00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:25,070
He's the one from my dream

28
00:04:25,430 --> 00:04:27,690
who gouged out his own Clairvoyance Eye.

29
00:04:33,300 --> 00:04:34,620
Young man,

30
00:04:34,950 --> 00:04:36,800
you have
a Clairvoyance Eye on your forehead.

31
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:37,800
Are you…

32
00:04:38,070 --> 00:04:39,560
a descendant of the Yang family?

33
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:40,890
Miss, you're mistaken.

34
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,320
I'm Mu Mie. I'm not from the Yang family.

35
00:04:43,580 --> 00:04:44,640
Your surname is Mu?

36
00:04:44,790 --> 00:04:46,320
What is your father's name?

37
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,510
My late father was Mu Renzhi.

38
00:04:48,510 --> 00:04:49,950
He was the fifth child in the family,

39
00:04:49,950 --> 00:04:51,680
so people called him Mu Xiaowu.

40
00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:55,830
Then, is your mother's name

41
00:04:55,830 --> 00:04:56,870
Yang Yan?

42
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:02,490
You know my late mother?

43
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:05,930
What?

44
00:05:06,190 --> 00:05:07,190
Your late mother?

45
00:05:08,170 --> 00:05:09,570
What happened to my aunt?

46
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:18,980
So you're from 20 years ago.

47
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:20,540
Unfortunately,

48
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:23,580
my mother passed away six months ago.

49
00:05:24,780 --> 00:05:27,550
I didn't expect you to be so talented

50
00:05:27,850 --> 00:05:29,580
and have Clairvoyance as well.

51
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:31,300
Did you learn it from your mother?

52
00:05:31,300 --> 00:05:32,090
No.

53
00:05:33,170 --> 00:05:34,680
When I was little,

54
00:05:34,810 --> 00:05:37,100
I learned it from a masked guy.

55
00:05:39,159 --> 00:05:40,240
A masked guy?

56
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:42,730
Could it have been me?

57
00:05:43,190 --> 00:05:44,850
That masked guy,

58
00:05:45,070 --> 00:05:46,730
did he tell you anything else?

59
00:05:46,940 --> 00:05:49,800
After teaching me
to awaken Clairvoyance, he left.

60
00:05:50,700 --> 00:05:52,930
Cousin, do you know him?

61
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:55,750
I don't.

62
00:05:57,680 --> 00:05:58,280
Oh, right.

63
00:05:58,840 --> 00:06:00,700
Why did you come to Baiyu Village?

64
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:01,650
I came to...

65
00:06:07,980 --> 00:06:10,070
Better not tell him for now.

66
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:12,870
I'm here to attend to something.

67
00:06:13,010 --> 00:06:14,750
But by the time I arrived,

68
00:06:15,270 --> 00:06:17,270
Chief and the others had already...

69
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:24,780
Miss Cuiyu Mingluan.

70
00:06:25,070 --> 00:06:25,800
Please wait.

71
00:06:29,430 --> 00:06:30,800
How do you know my name?

72
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:47,040
I need to go patrol the city now.

73
00:06:49,430 --> 00:06:51,360
I know you're pretending to sleep.

74
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:58,050
Keep a close eye on my canary.

75
00:06:58,190 --> 00:06:59,680
If anything happens to him,

76
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:01,280
you'll have to answer for it.

77
00:07:01,390 --> 00:07:02,040
Yes.

78
00:07:06,270 --> 00:07:09,200
What a good opportunity
to explore the Rebirth Pool.

79
00:07:26,020 --> 00:07:27,860
Do you smell anything?

80
00:07:28,460 --> 00:07:29,600
I don't know.

81
00:07:30,270 --> 00:07:32,630
My legs feel weak now,

82
00:07:32,650 --> 00:07:34,450
and my vision's getting blurry.

83
00:07:35,580 --> 00:07:36,810
Me too.

84
00:07:59,870 --> 00:08:01,410
The demonic aura is overwhelming.

85
00:08:01,410 --> 00:08:03,510
What a powerful magical artifact.

86
00:08:04,220 --> 00:08:07,120
But… something is missing.

87
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:11,150
Above the water,

88
00:08:11,620 --> 00:08:13,280
there seems to be a formation.

89
00:08:14,340 --> 00:08:15,830
Judging from its energy,

90
00:08:16,900 --> 00:08:18,830
it has a purifying effect.

91
00:08:19,060 --> 00:08:21,520
Who dares to trespass into the Rebirth Pool?

92
00:08:25,690 --> 00:08:27,000
It's you?

93
00:08:27,270 --> 00:08:30,840
Any trespasser must die.

94
00:08:33,159 --> 00:08:34,500
Don't you dare hurt him.

95
00:08:44,970 --> 00:08:46,920
So this is the Golden Dawn.

96
00:08:47,830 --> 00:08:51,340
Left Guardian,
you indeed have an affair with him.

97
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:53,720
It's none of your business.

98
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:56,440
He must die today.

99
00:08:56,500 --> 00:08:59,940
You're just as guilty for protecting him.

100
00:09:00,910 --> 00:09:02,000
Ye Yuan,

101
00:09:02,590 --> 00:09:04,110
you're speaking too soon.

102
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,970
Jia Lan's power to control demons

103
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:20,890
is truly impressive.

104
00:09:21,390 --> 00:09:22,530
Tell me,

105
00:09:22,690 --> 00:09:26,070
what exactly is wrong with the Rebirth Pool?

106
00:09:30,940 --> 00:09:32,860
The Seven-Star Alignment

107
00:09:33,950 --> 00:09:35,950
is about to end.

108
00:09:36,110 --> 00:09:38,440
I must find the leech demon

109
00:09:38,590 --> 00:09:40,200
before time runs out.

110
00:09:40,230 --> 00:09:43,940
She has the last fragment
of the Golden Dawn inside her.

111
00:09:44,150 --> 00:09:45,720
But the leech demon

112
00:09:46,340 --> 00:09:49,370
was taken away by that three-eyed guy

113
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:50,650
from 20 years ago.

114
00:09:51,820 --> 00:09:55,250
What does Lord Jiuhuo
intend to do with the Golden Dawn?

115
00:09:56,050 --> 00:10:00,450
The Golden Dawn
is the most powerful magical artifact of the Netherworld Clan.

116
00:10:01,010 --> 00:10:02,490
Once it's repaired,

117
00:10:02,550 --> 00:10:06,410
Lord Jiuhuo can use it
to break the Boundary and release the Black Fox.

118
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:11,170
Everything is normal at the Rebirth Pool today.

119
00:10:11,660 --> 00:10:13,830
You haven't seen Wangquan Hongye,

120
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:15,480
nor have you seen me.

121
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:32,240
I can't shake the feeling

122
00:10:32,490 --> 00:10:34,390
that something just happened.

123
00:10:44,540 --> 00:10:48,560
[Six-Winged Golden Bird]
[One-eyed Lion King] [Cuiyu Mingluan]

124
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:47,720
Many names of the great demons

125
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:49,670
on this booklet have been crossed out—

126
00:10:49,670 --> 00:10:51,630
yours included.

127
00:10:52,550 --> 00:10:55,750
They say you escaped from the breeding ground.

128
00:10:55,840 --> 00:10:57,440
What is that place?

129
00:10:58,120 --> 00:10:59,580
What secrets does it hold?

130
00:11:01,030 --> 00:11:02,560
I don't remember anything.

131
00:11:04,790 --> 00:11:05,910
I can't help you.

132
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:09,140
Miss Cuiyu,

133
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:10,480
why…

134
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:13,550
why did you kill those people in Baiyu Village?

135
00:11:13,550 --> 00:11:15,480
I really don't remember anything.

136
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:19,350
Sky City

137
00:11:19,370 --> 00:11:21,450
must be hiding countless secrets,

138
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:25,450
and you are the key to uncovering these secrets.

139
00:11:25,640 --> 00:11:28,380
So please think carefully again.

140
00:11:29,150 --> 00:11:30,900
Just because you visited Baiyu Village,

141
00:11:30,900 --> 00:11:33,190
Ye Yuan massacred the entire village.

142
00:11:33,570 --> 00:11:34,900
So this secret

143
00:11:35,280 --> 00:11:37,210
must be very important to Sky City.

144
00:11:38,680 --> 00:11:39,810
All I know is

145
00:11:40,650 --> 00:11:42,290
Sky City is very dangerous.

146
00:11:44,140 --> 00:11:46,340
I really can't remember anything else.

147
00:11:52,810 --> 00:11:55,530
Miss Cuiyu, I know hypnosis.

148
00:11:55,720 --> 00:11:57,850
I can enter your mind and see your past.

149
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,030
If you don't mind—

150
00:12:00,030 --> 00:12:00,790
I do mind.

151
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:05,480
I don't want to know about that past.

152
00:12:06,030 --> 00:12:07,680
You're being hunted by people from Sky City,

153
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:09,680
and it's chaos everywhere outside.

154
00:12:09,970 --> 00:12:11,440
Only by staying with us

155
00:12:11,630 --> 00:12:13,000
can you be safe.

156
00:12:14,620 --> 00:12:16,480
You can barely protect yourself.

157
00:12:17,270 --> 00:12:19,100
How can you guarantee my safety?

158
00:12:23,580 --> 00:12:25,780
What… do you mean?

159
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:35,320
This young man's injuries
are severe, both internally and externally.

160
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:37,230
He's also drained too much power.

161
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:39,980
He won't be able to use Clairvoyance for a while.

162
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:51,340
Miss Cuiyu.

163
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:55,550
I've heard that
leech demons are all excellent healers.

164
00:12:55,790 --> 00:12:58,390
Can you prescribe
something to help my cousin?

165
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:02,120
I didn't bring any pills with me.

166
00:13:06,970 --> 00:13:10,020
Rejecting Dummy so coldly
will break his heart.

167
00:13:10,670 --> 00:13:11,510
Besides,

168
00:13:12,030 --> 00:13:14,020
after we heal this Yang fellow,

169
00:13:14,180 --> 00:13:16,420
he'll be able to protect us.

170
00:13:18,790 --> 00:13:19,510
Fine.

171
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:22,240
Since you saved my life,

172
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:24,220
I can prescribe medicine for you.

173
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:25,720
But on one condition:

174
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,360
he has to assist me.

175
00:13:35,670 --> 00:13:37,440
You've got some nerve

176
00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:40,240
sneaking into the Rebirth Pool.

177
00:13:42,270 --> 00:13:44,400
Actually, you knew I was faking sleep,

178
00:13:44,770 --> 00:13:47,560
so naturally, you expected me to act.

179
00:13:48,210 --> 00:13:49,830
The mandala flower on my neck

180
00:13:49,900 --> 00:13:51,430
should be able to locate me.

181
00:13:51,810 --> 00:13:53,740
So you'd have come sooner or later.

182
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:56,960
You knew I'd rescue you?

183
00:13:57,110 --> 00:13:58,310
I knew

184
00:13:58,650 --> 00:14:00,020
you were testing me,

185
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:02,330
testing how bold I am

186
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:04,530
and whether I have any value to you.

187
00:14:04,890 --> 00:14:05,940
Value?

188
00:14:07,270 --> 00:14:08,670
You're quite something,

189
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:13,060
using the aphrodisiac incense so skillfully.

190
00:14:13,770 --> 00:14:15,760
What exactly are you scheming?

191
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:17,540
As you've seen,

192
00:14:17,960 --> 00:14:19,490
that huge magical artifact

193
00:14:19,770 --> 00:14:21,640
is used to rescue Jia Lan.

194
00:14:22,390 --> 00:14:23,920
And once Jia Lan is rescued,

195
00:14:23,980 --> 00:14:25,110
you, Left Guardian,

196
00:14:25,650 --> 00:14:27,250
will cease to exist.

197
00:14:27,630 --> 00:14:29,710
There are eyes everywhere in Sky City.

198
00:14:29,710 --> 00:14:31,960
Even though you've altered Ye Yuan's memory,

199
00:14:31,960 --> 00:14:34,260
the fact that
you've been keeping me by your side

200
00:14:34,260 --> 00:14:36,060
will eventually be discovered.

201
00:14:36,830 --> 00:14:38,440
Instead of being on the defensive,

202
00:14:38,440 --> 00:14:40,160
we'd better take the offensive.

203
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:41,850
Bring me to Jiuhuo.

204
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:45,020
Let's put on a show together.

205
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:02,810
Wangquan Hongye?

206
00:15:03,010 --> 00:15:05,780
Shouldn't he be at Mount Xuankong?

207
00:15:06,080 --> 00:15:08,420
I wanted to keep him around as a plaything,

208
00:15:08,870 --> 00:15:11,590
so I took the liberty of bringing him out.

209
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:13,620
Then how did he wake up?

210
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:17,360
Lord Jiuhuo, you've
stumped me with that question.

211
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:20,390
I don't know how he woke up either.

212
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:22,260
It doesn't matter.

213
00:15:22,430 --> 00:15:24,120
I'd like to see

214
00:15:24,920 --> 00:15:27,660
if it's really so hard to kill him.

215
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:31,640
Left Guardian!

216
00:15:33,650 --> 00:15:34,870
Lord Jiuhuo,

217
00:15:34,980 --> 00:15:37,570
he can't die now.

218
00:15:39,390 --> 00:15:40,640
Why?

219
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:42,930
Have you fallen for him?

220
00:15:53,310 --> 00:15:55,640
A plaything is just a plaything,

221
00:15:55,750 --> 00:15:58,550
but we must make full use of him.

222
00:16:05,390 --> 00:16:09,240
I heard that the leech demon
the Right Guardian was chasing

223
00:16:09,260 --> 00:16:11,710
was taken by that three-eyed human.

224
00:16:12,440 --> 00:16:14,280
There's no need to look for them.

225
00:16:14,550 --> 00:16:17,380
If we use Wangquan Hongye's life as bait,

226
00:16:17,670 --> 00:16:19,270
he'll definitely come to us.

227
00:16:21,960 --> 00:16:23,690
Left Guardian, by doing this,

228
00:16:23,750 --> 00:16:28,000
are you truly trying to solve my problems?

229
00:16:29,590 --> 00:16:32,550
Naturally, I'm being a bit selfish here.

230
00:16:32,690 --> 00:16:33,730
Go on.

231
00:16:33,790 --> 00:16:37,120
Lord Jiuhuo, you'll soon
have Jia Lan by your side.

232
00:16:37,230 --> 00:16:39,530
So if I want to keep him to entertain me,

233
00:16:39,630 --> 00:16:41,760
it shouldn't be too much to ask, right?

234
00:16:58,040 --> 00:17:00,100
There are countless men in the world.

235
00:17:00,170 --> 00:17:02,540
Why favor this

236
00:17:04,230 --> 00:17:05,920
particular human?

237
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,510
He's clever and interesting.

238
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:14,829
Like a tiger with teeth.

239
00:17:16,569 --> 00:17:18,480
Keeping him by my side,

240
00:17:18,589 --> 00:17:21,440
I'll personally pull out each of his teeth.

241
00:17:21,490 --> 00:17:25,050
Once I've used him up, I'll kill him again.

242
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:28,940
Isn't that entertaining?

243
00:17:32,590 --> 00:17:33,240
Fine.

244
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:35,400
I'll trust you this once.

245
00:17:35,800 --> 00:17:37,480
You have three days.

246
00:17:37,510 --> 00:17:39,480
Use Wangquan Hongye as bait

247
00:17:39,750 --> 00:17:42,690
to lure out those restless little pests.

248
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:55,850
Spread the word across the city:

249
00:17:55,850 --> 00:17:57,330
within three days,

250
00:17:57,360 --> 00:18:00,060
if I can't see
the leech demon Cuiyu Mingluan,

251
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:02,740
I'll execute Wangquan Hongye.

252
00:18:31,470 --> 00:18:34,900
Sir, what are you doing?

253
00:18:36,110 --> 00:18:37,710
Aren't you afraid of the sun?

254
00:18:37,990 --> 00:18:39,320
I'll shield you from it.

255
00:18:39,640 --> 00:18:40,820
I'm not…

256
00:18:41,790 --> 00:18:42,590
Thank you.

257
00:18:44,790 --> 00:18:47,720
You're really
saying one thing and meaning another.

258
00:18:53,710 --> 00:18:55,430
Come on, say something.

259
00:18:55,460 --> 00:18:58,190
Are you planning
to be this awkward the whole way?

260
00:19:00,500 --> 00:19:03,070
Sir, um...

261
00:19:03,540 --> 00:19:04,950
why did you help me?

262
00:19:06,290 --> 00:19:07,940
I don't even know

263
00:19:08,330 --> 00:19:10,870
if I actually killed someone or not.

264
00:19:10,900 --> 00:19:12,500
My intuition tells me

265
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:15,410
you're not a demon
who'd kill without reason.

266
00:19:15,890 --> 00:19:18,050
You... you'd trust a demon?

267
00:19:18,550 --> 00:19:21,430
Both humans and demons
have good and bad in them.

268
00:19:21,880 --> 00:19:23,080
Why distrust demons?

269
00:19:39,710 --> 00:19:40,540
Miss,

270
00:19:41,020 --> 00:19:42,010
what's wrong?

271
00:19:43,720 --> 00:19:46,230
I... I want to say…

272
00:19:47,410 --> 00:19:50,930
you're the first human to trust me and save me.

273
00:19:53,240 --> 00:19:55,440
What did you just say?

274
00:19:57,800 --> 00:19:59,360
I want to say thank you.

275
00:20:01,720 --> 00:20:02,510
Mr. Mu,

276
00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:03,920
do you…

277
00:20:05,110 --> 00:20:06,240
want to learn

278
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:09,100
the Leech Clan's
secret blood exchange technique?

279
00:20:09,270 --> 00:20:11,270
I don't quite understand it myself,

280
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:13,350
but they say after learning it,

281
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:16,570
you can master unparalleled martial arts,

282
00:20:16,750 --> 00:20:19,010
bring honor to your family, and all that.

283
00:20:23,410 --> 00:20:24,630
Sorry.

284
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:27,820
I forgot your parents had passed away.

285
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:31,730
If you're bad with words, just stay quiet!

286
00:20:38,440 --> 00:20:40,050
Do you want to learn it or not?

287
00:20:40,160 --> 00:20:41,280
I heard

288
00:20:41,590 --> 00:20:43,320
you can practice it with a girl.

289
00:20:46,160 --> 00:20:47,240
I'm talking to you.

290
00:21:01,710 --> 00:21:03,910
Miss, there's honeysuckle here.

291
00:21:08,360 --> 00:21:10,060
He's really a dummy.

292
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:27,370
It's for me?

293
00:21:28,270 --> 00:21:29,300
Yes.

294
00:21:29,900 --> 00:21:31,890
I think this bunch of flowers
is very beautiful,

295
00:21:31,890 --> 00:21:33,420
so I'm giving it to you both.

296
00:21:37,070 --> 00:21:38,750
How do you know

297
00:21:39,530 --> 00:21:40,820
there are two of us?

298
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:43,110
Your eye colors are different.

299
00:21:43,630 --> 00:21:45,680
The girl
who guided me here earlier had blue eyes,

300
00:21:45,680 --> 00:21:46,880
and you have red ones.

301
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:50,580
Just eye colors are different?

302
00:21:50,750 --> 00:21:52,180
Your personalities are different too.

303
00:21:52,180 --> 00:21:56,460
Miss Cuiyu with blue eyes is gentle and kind,

304
00:21:57,110 --> 00:22:00,400
while you… are fiery and straightforward.

305
00:22:01,810 --> 00:22:03,820
Then who do you prefer?

306
00:22:04,590 --> 00:22:06,550
Me or her?

307
00:22:11,660 --> 00:22:13,420
I was just joking.

308
00:22:13,570 --> 00:22:15,310
Do you really need to avoid me like this?

309
00:22:15,310 --> 00:22:16,440
Am I that unlikable?

310
00:22:17,960 --> 00:22:19,000
Besides,

311
00:22:19,620 --> 00:22:21,580
being only gentle and kind

312
00:22:21,790 --> 00:22:24,350
is not enough to survive in this world.

313
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:26,500
Don't get me wrong.

314
00:22:26,970 --> 00:22:28,650
Both of you are very nice.

315
00:22:29,070 --> 00:22:31,000
So, no matter which one of you it is,

316
00:22:31,310 --> 00:22:33,310
I don't believe you killed someone.

317
00:22:34,440 --> 00:22:35,090
Miss,

318
00:22:35,800 --> 00:22:38,050
can you tell me what exactly happened?

319
00:22:39,430 --> 00:22:41,010
So you're trying to trick me into talking.

320
00:22:41,010 --> 00:22:42,510
Don't push your luck just because

321
00:22:42,510 --> 00:22:44,210
I've been nice to you.

322
00:22:44,530 --> 00:22:46,160
Miss, that's not what I mean.

323
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:50,620
I just think

324
00:22:51,180 --> 00:22:52,400
you might want to know

325
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:53,590
the truth as well.

326
00:22:54,820 --> 00:22:57,090
Demons kill by nature.

327
00:22:57,430 --> 00:23:00,270
Do you think I should care about the truth?

328
00:23:00,310 --> 00:23:01,370
It's not like that.

329
00:23:01,770 --> 00:23:03,960
In my eyes, humans and demons are the same.

330
00:23:03,960 --> 00:23:04,880
Dummy,

331
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:07,510
don't think your theory about right and wrong

332
00:23:07,510 --> 00:23:09,000
regardless of human or demon

333
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:10,130
is enough to sway me.

334
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:11,920
But there's one thing…

335
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:14,250
Say one more word,

336
00:23:15,680 --> 00:23:17,590
and I'll really get angry.

337
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:24,920
Sorry.

338
00:23:26,540 --> 00:23:27,710
I overstepped.

339
00:23:31,700 --> 00:23:33,980
We've picked enough. Let's head back.

340
00:24:03,470 --> 00:24:05,460
You're not afraid at all, are you?

341
00:24:07,420 --> 00:24:10,070
Why are you ignoring me?

342
00:24:11,660 --> 00:24:13,290
Your Lord Jiuhuo said

343
00:24:13,320 --> 00:24:15,120
I'd be safe for these three days.

344
00:24:16,710 --> 00:24:19,860
But I can continue to torment you, can't I?

345
00:24:21,010 --> 00:24:23,390
I've seen a sunset like this once before.

346
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:26,010
Just like today.

347
00:24:27,340 --> 00:24:29,360
With your Dongfang Huaizhu?

348
00:24:30,120 --> 00:24:31,930
The sun set quickly that day.

349
00:24:32,920 --> 00:24:35,220
I'm not interested in your story.

350
00:24:36,250 --> 00:24:38,050
Then just watch with me for a bit.

351
00:24:38,420 --> 00:24:39,590
Consider it

352
00:24:40,730 --> 00:24:42,790
a reward for completing the task.

353
00:25:09,880 --> 00:25:12,260
One of you wants me as a vessel for Jia Lan.

354
00:25:12,500 --> 00:25:14,700
The other wants Dongfang Huaizhu back.

355
00:25:15,040 --> 00:25:16,740
Both of you are dreaming.

356
00:25:17,320 --> 00:25:18,630
I'm only myself.

357
00:25:19,620 --> 00:25:22,430
Using Wangquan Hongye to deal with Jiuhuo

358
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:24,310
is not a bad idea.

359
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:32,350
These pills

360
00:25:32,430 --> 00:25:35,070
can help you
quickly recover your powers within three days.

361
00:25:35,070 --> 00:25:36,790
Then you can use Clairvoyance again.

362
00:25:36,790 --> 00:25:38,050
Thank you, Miss Cuiyu.

363
00:25:38,110 --> 00:25:39,550
But after I recover,

364
00:25:40,350 --> 00:25:42,210
will you still insist on leaving?

365
00:25:43,510 --> 00:25:46,770
Actually, there's something
I've been wanting to ask you.

366
00:25:49,070 --> 00:25:49,640
Go ahead.

367
00:25:50,750 --> 00:25:53,750
Did you exhaust your spiritual power

368
00:25:54,110 --> 00:25:56,110
to use Clairvoyance a few days ago?

369
00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:57,070
Yes.

370
00:25:57,680 --> 00:25:59,160
Then do you know

371
00:25:59,530 --> 00:26:02,180
exhausting your spiritual and mental power

372
00:26:02,790 --> 00:26:04,160
could cost you…

373
00:26:05,160 --> 00:26:06,920
at least 10 years of your life?

374
00:26:07,270 --> 00:26:08,000
I know.

375
00:26:08,710 --> 00:26:11,180
And you still did it? Why?

376
00:26:15,330 --> 00:26:17,270
At that time, Zui was in danger.

377
00:26:18,890 --> 00:26:20,400
If I hadn't done it,

378
00:26:22,270 --> 00:26:23,680
I might have lost her.

379
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:25,970
You can't clot blood properly.

380
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:27,570
If that wound had been any worse,

381
00:26:27,570 --> 00:26:28,970
you'd have died for sure.

382
00:26:29,680 --> 00:26:30,550
Between my life

383
00:26:31,510 --> 00:26:32,450

384
00:26:31,710 --> 00:26:33,920

is that how much you care for me?

00:27:57,190 --> 00:27:58,220
You're going out?

417
00:27:58,840 --> 00:27:59,510
Yes.

418
00:28:00,220 --> 00:28:01,310
For what?

419
00:28:03,500 --> 00:28:04,630
To meet someone.

420
00:28:06,050 --> 00:28:07,110
Who are you meeting

421
00:28:07,330 --> 00:28:08,590
at this late hour?

422
00:28:10,740 --> 00:28:12,140
A man.

423
00:28:17,210 --> 00:28:18,200
Do I look good?

424
00:28:19,740 --> 00:28:21,160
Do you like how I look?

425
00:28:25,030 --> 00:28:26,030
What if I do?

426
00:28:26,540 --> 00:28:27,790
What if I don't?

427
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:31,790
You're quite interesting today.

428
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:35,720
Too bad I don't have time to play with you.

429
00:28:36,540 --> 00:28:38,340
What exactly are you going to do?

430
00:28:38,920 --> 00:28:41,310
I'm going to find out
if what you said is true.

431
00:28:41,310 --> 00:28:43,040
When Lord Jiuhuo feeds,

432
00:28:43,060 --> 00:28:45,030
his prey always wears red.

433
00:28:45,220 --> 00:28:47,280
Why else would I be dressed like this?

434
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:49,970
You can't do this.

435
00:28:50,030 --> 00:28:53,130
If I can control Ye Yuan,
I can control Jiuhuo.

436
00:28:53,410 --> 00:28:54,910
I don't like waiting!

437
00:28:55,740 --> 00:28:57,920
Jiuhuo is much more powerful than Ye Yuan.

438
00:28:57,920 --> 00:28:59,970
When Lord Jiuhuo feeds,

439
00:29:00,350 --> 00:29:01,600
he's at his weakest.

440
00:29:02,940 --> 00:29:04,340
Huaizhu, you can't go.

441
00:29:04,370 --> 00:29:05,240
Jiuhuo…

442
00:29:07,850 --> 00:29:08,650
You…

443
00:29:09,470 --> 00:29:11,320
Huaizhu, Jiuhuo is a celestial demon.

444
00:29:11,320 --> 00:29:13,380
Don't do anything foolish! Huaizhu!

445
00:30:08,590 --> 00:30:11,610
Lord Ye Yuan sent me to serve you.

446
00:30:12,510 --> 00:30:13,350
Come closer.

447
00:30:16,770 --> 00:30:18,630
I said, come closer.

448
00:30:19,310 --> 00:30:20,880
Why aren't you moving?

449
00:30:21,790 --> 00:30:22,720
I heard

450
00:30:23,750 --> 00:30:26,220
no woman who has served Lord Jiuhuo

451
00:30:26,450 --> 00:30:28,500
has ever left alive.

452
00:30:33,730 --> 00:30:35,180
Don't worry.

453
00:30:35,790 --> 00:30:37,350
You'll die for me,

454
00:30:38,260 --> 00:30:40,650
and I'll surely remember your face.

455
00:30:48,930 --> 00:30:50,400
Left Guardian.

456
00:30:51,090 --> 00:30:53,590
Lord Jiuhuo,
you're indeed a celestial demon.

457
00:30:53,590 --> 00:30:56,330
You can still fight back
when you're so weak.

458
00:30:56,620 --> 00:30:57,690
However,

459
00:30:58,370 --> 00:31:00,330
your efforts are in vain.

460
00:31:10,050 --> 00:31:11,230
Tell me,

461
00:31:12,220 --> 00:31:14,930
who am I really?

462
00:31:15,310 --> 00:31:18,970
I found you 20 years ago.

463
00:31:19,110 --> 00:31:20,870
You're Dongfang Huaizhu

464
00:31:21,070 --> 00:31:22,680
from the Divine Fire Villa.

465
00:31:24,810 --> 00:31:26,490
So what he said

466
00:31:26,890 --> 00:31:28,240
is true after all.

467
00:31:31,010 --> 00:31:33,160
Why did you bring me here?

468
00:31:33,300 --> 00:31:37,150
Why do I have the Black Fox's demonic aura?

469
00:31:37,780 --> 00:31:40,250
I want you to tell me everything.

470
00:31:40,750 --> 00:31:43,650
You were used by your mother, Jiang Juanxue,

471
00:31:44,050 --> 00:31:46,830
as a vessel for Jia Lan.

472
00:31:46,960 --> 00:31:49,290
After Jia Lan
completely lost her physical body

473
00:31:49,290 --> 00:31:51,260
and turned into the Black Fox,

474
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:53,750
everything your mother, Jiang Juanxue, did

475
00:31:53,750 --> 00:31:57,070
was to find a new body for Jia Lan.

476
00:31:57,240 --> 00:31:58,720
And that is you,

477
00:31:58,770 --> 00:32:00,870
Dongfang Huaizhu.

478
00:32:05,820 --> 00:32:07,900
Dongfang Huaizhu…

479
00:32:09,720 --> 00:32:14,080
So she's a fool betrayed by her own mother.

480
00:32:16,560 --> 00:32:18,230
When the Boundary breaks,

481
00:32:18,400 --> 00:32:20,350
the Black Fox will possess me.

482
00:32:21,310 --> 00:32:23,200
Your Jia Lan will return,

483
00:32:23,270 --> 00:32:25,040
and I will disappear.

484
00:32:31,860 --> 00:32:33,750
You want Jia Lan.

485
00:32:34,040 --> 00:32:37,110
Wangquan Hongye wants Dongfang Huaizhu.

486
00:32:37,540 --> 00:32:40,190
Since no one has chosen me,

487
00:32:40,920 --> 00:32:42,980
I won't let you off either.

488
00:32:43,810 --> 00:32:46,260
Tell me, what restrains you?

489
00:32:46,440 --> 00:32:48,420
Dragon bone and dragon blood.

490
00:32:48,620 --> 00:32:50,830
The nemesis of the Netherworld Clan

491
00:32:51,350 --> 00:32:53,500
is the Dragon Clan.

492
00:33:23,480 --> 00:33:25,470
I somehow feel

493
00:33:25,640 --> 00:33:29,580
I've forgotten something
at the Rebirth Pool today.

494
00:33:37,430 --> 00:33:39,430
Was Left Guardian

495
00:33:39,580 --> 00:33:41,350
wearing red today?

496
00:33:41,510 --> 00:33:42,200
Yes.

497
00:33:42,270 --> 00:33:45,270
Since returning from Mount Xuankong,

498
00:33:45,470 --> 00:33:47,730
she doesn't like wearing black anymore.

499
00:34:09,840 --> 00:34:10,969
Good morning, Miss.

500
00:34:12,400 --> 00:34:13,320
Mr. Mu.

501
00:34:13,880 --> 00:34:15,210
What are you doing here?

502
00:34:17,159 --> 00:34:20,120
[999 Cold Medicine]

503
00:34:18,429 --> 00:34:20,350
Mr. Mu, I'm leaving.

504
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:22,110
I know I'm weak

505
00:34:22,190 --> 00:34:23,630
and can't help you much.

506
00:34:23,770 --> 00:34:25,980
I made this cold medicine myself.

507
00:34:26,070 --> 00:34:27,190
It clears heat, detoxifies toxins,

508
00:34:27,190 --> 00:34:29,190
and helps you ward off cold and wind.

509
00:34:29,440 --> 00:34:30,560
Keep it with you

510
00:34:30,630 --> 00:34:32,210
in case you ever need it.

511
00:34:32,460 --> 00:34:33,719
The world is vast.

512
00:34:33,840 --> 00:34:35,500
Please take care of yourself.

513
00:34:37,150 --> 00:34:38,770
I don't know your pain, so I shouldn't

514
00:34:38,770 --> 00:34:40,100
have told you to be kind.

515
00:34:41,230 --> 00:34:42,780
I overstepped yesterday.

516
00:34:42,989 --> 00:34:43,670
I'm sorry.

517
00:34:47,320 --> 00:34:48,030
And…

518
00:34:51,980 --> 00:34:53,179
This is for you.

519
00:35:04,160 --> 00:35:06,440
I couldn't sleep last night,

520
00:35:06,730 --> 00:35:08,270
so early this morning,

521
00:35:08,440 --> 00:35:10,840
I went to pick flowers and made another one.

522
00:35:11,590 --> 00:35:12,360
Thank you.

523
00:35:16,360 --> 00:35:17,320
Well then…

524
00:35:20,600 --> 00:35:21,690
Take care, Miss.

525
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:41,600
You coward.

526
00:35:41,620 --> 00:35:43,220
What's there to be afraid of?

527
00:35:43,470 --> 00:35:44,670
If you have a grudge,

528
00:35:44,710 --> 00:35:45,940
just settle it.

529
00:35:46,150 --> 00:35:47,000
Besides,

530
00:35:47,410 --> 00:35:49,090
can you bear to leave Dummy?

531
00:35:49,360 --> 00:35:50,930
Stop it.

532
00:35:51,150 --> 00:35:53,960
He's kind to you because he's a good person.

533
00:35:55,470 --> 00:35:57,730
There's no way he would ever love a demon.

534
00:35:58,160 --> 00:36:00,090
How would you know if you don't try?

535
00:36:05,470 --> 00:36:06,550
Dummy,

536
00:36:06,880 --> 00:36:08,070
you guys want to enter my mind, right?

537
00:36:08,070 --> 00:36:09,140
No problem.

538
00:36:29,440 --> 00:36:30,240
Good morning.

539
00:36:31,400 --> 00:36:33,960
Shouldn't we exchange some information?

540
00:36:38,040 --> 00:36:39,000
You first.

541
00:36:42,360 --> 00:36:43,910
Jiuhuo told me

542
00:36:44,030 --> 00:36:46,260
I really am Dongfang Huaizhu.

543
00:36:47,150 --> 00:36:52,470
I really am the vessel he prepared for Jia Lan.

544
00:36:54,750 --> 00:36:56,880
There's nothing I know that you don't.

545
00:36:58,500 --> 00:37:00,190
But I can contact Yang Yitan.

546
00:37:00,440 --> 00:37:02,200
If we want to break the deadlock,

547
00:37:02,200 --> 00:37:03,400
we need outside help.

548
00:37:03,980 --> 00:37:05,970
Jiuhuo controls everything.

549
00:37:06,330 --> 00:37:07,970
You can't leave Sky City.

550
00:37:09,290 --> 00:37:10,500
But you can.
