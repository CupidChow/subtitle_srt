[Wangquan]

00:01:57,759 --> 00:02:00,340
As expected, a problem has arisen.

5
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:02,560
Ten years ago, Master disappeared.

6
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:04,680
He took the Wangquan Sword with him.

7
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:08,840
No matter how meticulously we forge
in the Wangquan Sword Furnace,

8
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:10,080
a fake sword

9
00:02:10,130 --> 00:02:12,290
is still just a fake sword.

[Wangquan]

11
00:02:13,430 --> 00:02:14,830
At Nangong's residence,

12
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:17,220
Zhang Zheng noticed something was amiss,

13
00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:18,550
but he didn't expose me.

14
00:02:19,430 --> 00:02:21,090
We'll deal with it as it comes.

15
00:02:21,460 --> 00:02:22,800
Don't worry, Young Master.

16
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:25,190
I'll forge a new sword as soon as possible.

17
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:27,620
The family masters

18
00:02:27,750 --> 00:02:29,550
are already waiting in the hall.

19
00:02:29,630 --> 00:02:31,280
Except for the Nangong family,

20
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:33,079

Mr. Fei.

24
00:02:52,030 --> 00:02:53,490
The Yiqi Alliance decree:

25
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:56,970
Forging swords with demon cores
will backfire on the sword masters,

26
00:02:56,970 --> 00:02:59,120
causing them to lose their mind.

27
00:02:59,190 --> 00:03:00,760
The harm is terrifying.

28
00:03:01,070 --> 00:03:02,280
From today onwards,

29
00:03:02,750 --> 00:03:04,210
within the Yiqi Alliance,

30
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:08,110
all families are forbidden to
forge swords using demon cores.

Wangquan Hongye.

32
00:03:18,710 --> 00:03:21,870
Don't think that just because you've banned
the use of demon cores in sword forging,

33
00:03:21,870 --> 00:03:24,680
the Nangong family has no other way
to deal with you.

34
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:27,840
We still have a long fight ahead of us.

Mu Xiaowu has been kneeling outside our house

38
00:03:46,150 --> 00:03:47,329
for a day and a night now.

39
00:03:47,329 --> 00:03:49,060
If he keeps kneeling like this,

40
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:51,000
I'm afraid something bad might happen.

41
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:51,780

42
00:03:53,030 --> 00:03:55,130

[Yang Ying from the Clairvoyant Yang family, Yiqi Alliance]

Even if our Yang family
has fallen on hard times,

45
00:03:58,710 --> 00:04:00,310
we are still descendants of a noble family.

46
00:04:00,310 --> 00:04:02,150
It's that aunt of yours

47
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:04,870
who shamelessly did such a foolish thing

48
00:04:05,690 --> 00:04:07,950
and insisted that I agree to their marriage.

49
00:04:07,950 --> 00:04:09,440

51
00:04:12,430 --> 00:04:14,840
Do you really think Aunt cares about

52
00:04:15,320 --> 00:04:17,610
being a descendant of a noble family?

53
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:20,800

What kind of talk is that?

55
00:04:22,450 --> 00:04:23,510
What your aunt has ruined

56
00:04:23,510 --> 00:04:25,070
is the reputation of our Yang family.

It's you, Yitan, who will be
affected by this.

Get a midwife here

and get rid of that bastard in Yan's belly.

61
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:33,680
Yes.

brings you to our humble abode?

98
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:54,159
Master, you may have already heard that

99
00:06:54,159 --> 00:06:58,159
it was because I personally granted
a special pardon to your son-in-law

100
00:06:58,200 --> 00:07:00,430
that the Inspection Bureau released him.

101
00:07:00,430 --> 00:07:01,630
I have heard about it.

102
00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:04,040
Young Master.

103
00:07:05,070 --> 00:07:06,330
It truly is a noble act.

104
00:07:06,510 --> 00:07:08,240
I'm not the noble one.

105
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:11,070
It was just

106
00:07:11,570 --> 00:07:13,170
Xiaowu once saved my life by chance.

107
00:07:13,170 --> 00:07:16,430
I'm merely repaying the kindness.

He has never mentioned this matter before.

109
00:07:22,210 --> 00:07:24,600
So the truly noble one is

110
00:07:24,870 --> 00:07:26,470
your great son-in-law here.

111
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:37,140
Xiaowu's family all perished in the flood.

112
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:39,610
So I, as the young master, took the liberty,

113
00:07:39,610 --> 00:07:41,180
to prepare these betrothal gifts.

114
00:07:41,180 --> 00:07:43,640
I also asked a highly respected Taoist priest

115
00:07:43,640 --> 00:07:46,070
to pick an auspicious date,

116
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:57,140
[Mu Renzhi, Yang Yan]
[July 18th]

July 18th.

118
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:58,880
It will bring prosperity to the ancestors,

119
00:07:58,880 --> 00:08:00,680
and good fortune in all matters.

120
00:08:00,730 --> 00:08:02,510
July 18th?

121
00:08:02,620 --> 00:08:04,560
Isn't that just a month from now?

122
00:08:04,580 --> 00:08:07,460
To be precise, it's a little over a month.

123
00:08:07,830 --> 00:08:09,040
This period is neither too long

124
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:10,000
nor too short.

125
00:08:10,290 --> 00:08:11,690
It's just there won't be another

126
00:08:11,690 --> 00:08:15,140

127
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,210
What do you think, Master?

128
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:22,850
The date is well chosen,

129
00:08:22,880 --> 00:08:23,510
but...

130
00:08:23,510 --> 00:08:24,360
Excellent.

131
00:08:24,380 --> 00:08:26,020
Since you have no objections, Master,

132
00:08:26,020 --> 00:08:26,900

133
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:29,100
serve tea to your father-in-law.

134

Master.

135
00:08:40,510 --> 00:08:43,080
If you agree to let Yan marry me,

136
00:08:43,510 --> 00:08:44,570
I, Xiaowu, promise

137
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:47,850
that I will dedicate the rest of my life

138

to ensuring Yan's happiness and security.

139

If you want to marry my Yan,

140
00:08:58,690 --> 00:09:00,510
you must marry into our family

141
00:09:00,730 --> 00:09:02,890
and live with our Yang family.

142
00:09:15,020 --> 00:09:16,220
I, Xiaowu, will obey.

143
00:09:23,750 --> 00:09:26,900
Since the auspicious date was set by you,

144
00:09:28,630 --> 00:09:31,200
Young Master, I have a request as well.

145
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:32,660
On the wedding day,

146
00:09:33,290 --> 00:09:34,820
I will definitely be there.

147
00:09:35,510 --> 00:09:36,270
Good.

148
00:09:49,070 --> 00:09:50,030

149
00:09:50,050 --> 00:09:51,180
-Yan.
-How did it go?

150
00:09:53,340 --> 00:09:55,980
We did it. Our marriage is settled.

151
00:09:58,550 --> 00:09:59,550
My father agreed?

152
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:03,150
The wedding date is set for one month from now.

153
00:10:05,090 --> 00:10:05,930
That's great.

154
00:10:08,910 --> 00:10:10,840
Aunt, he knelt for too long.

155
00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:11,720
Go and rest now.

156
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:16,050
I, Xiaowu, will surely repay

157
00:10:16,050 --> 00:10:18,970
your kindness in the future, Young Master.

158
00:10:32,280 --> 00:10:33,050
Hongye.

159
00:10:33,550 --> 00:10:34,750
Why did you come here?

160
00:10:35,520 --> 00:10:38,180
You just found out about your aunt and Mu Xiaowu?

161
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:43,250
You know about my family's situation, Hongye.

162
00:10:44,700 --> 00:10:46,650
I've looked into Mu Xiaowu's background.

163
00:10:46,650 --> 00:10:47,910
He is indeed talented.

164
00:10:47,950 --> 00:10:49,270
After he joins the Yang family,

165
00:10:49,270 --> 00:10:50,700
he should become a great help to you

166
00:10:50,700 --> 00:10:53,560
in improving the Yang family's current situation.

167
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:55,550
Hongye, I-

168
00:10:55,550 --> 00:10:56,150
Alright.

169
00:10:57,270 --> 00:10:58,270
I'll be going now.

170
00:11:22,990 --> 00:11:25,320
Now that Yang Yan's matter is resolved,

171
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:27,050
your face is glowing, Huaizhu.

172
00:11:27,670 --> 00:11:30,080
Only when she and Xiaowu successfully get married

173
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:33,010
can this matter be considered completely resolved.

174
00:11:33,250 --> 00:11:36,450
Then where does this glow on your face
come from, Huaizhu?

175
00:11:38,870 --> 00:11:41,510
Could it be that since July 7th is approaching,

176
00:11:41,510 --> 00:11:43,240
it's the glow of anticipation?

177
00:11:43,750 --> 00:11:44,550
You remember

178
00:11:44,550 --> 00:11:45,910
the date quite clearly.

179
00:11:45,910 --> 00:11:46,790
Of course.

180
00:11:46,790 --> 00:11:48,270
That's my masked brother-in-law, after all.

181
00:11:48,270 --> 00:11:49,080
I'm

182
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:50,020
very satisfied with him.

183
00:11:50,020 --> 00:11:52,150
It can be said that it was love at first-

184
00:11:52,330 --> 00:11:55,390
No, it was love at first sight
on behalf of you, Huaizhu.

185
00:12:00,070 --> 00:12:01,390

in the front hall.

192
00:12:13,410 --> 00:12:15,930
They specially prepared these treasures for you

193
00:12:15,930 --> 00:12:17,720
and insisted that you must accept them.

194
00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:18,710
Renfeng.

195
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:24,500
These things are a token of their sincerity.

196
00:12:24,630 --> 00:12:26,030
You may accept them.

197
00:12:26,490 --> 00:12:27,820
However, in the future,

198
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:31,120
we shouldn't accept any more gifts.

199

200
00:12:32,270 --> 00:12:32,840
Yes.

203
00:12:37,090 --> 00:12:38,780
I just returned to the villa.

During my trip down the mountain this time,
I thought of you often,

208
00:12:49,740 --> 00:12:51,290
so I specially prepared a gift for you.

I'll serve you to take it.

214
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:13,980
It seems that after so many years,

215
00:13:13,980 --> 00:13:16,310
someone still doesn't know Huaizhu well.

216
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:19,340
She doesn't like these gaudy, glittering objects.

217
00:13:21,290 --> 00:13:24,150
Give it to me. I'll go exchange it
for some nice food.

218
00:13:25,280 --> 00:13:28,100

219

Go back to your room and have a good rest.

220
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:33,440
Yes, Master.

221
00:13:40,150 --> 00:13:42,510
Even if you don't want to accept his pursuit,

222
00:13:42,510 --> 00:13:43,870
don't be so harsh.

223
00:13:44,510 --> 00:13:47,280
After all, he is your eldest senior.

224
00:13:47,300 --> 00:13:48,620
I understand that you value him highly

225
00:13:48,620 --> 00:13:50,550
because he's the posthumous son

226
00:13:50,570 --> 00:13:52,170
of an old friend of yours, Father.

227
00:13:52,170 --> 00:13:53,370
That's exactly why

228
00:13:53,670 --> 00:13:56,030
I need to be very clear about my attitude.

229
00:13:58,750 --> 00:14:00,000
Yes. Right.

230
00:14:00,670 --> 00:14:02,270
You have a point, Huaizhu.

231
00:14:02,830 --> 00:14:06,070

those of other noble families,

making it difficult to shake their position for now.

243
00:14:47,750 --> 00:14:49,410
Young Master, you still need to take control of

244
00:14:49,410 --> 00:14:53,360

I believe you have your reasons.

369
00:21:06,750 --> 00:21:07,790
To me,

370
00:21:08,300 --> 00:21:11,200
your true self is more important
than your name.

371
00:21:12,510 --> 00:21:13,550
Besides,

372
00:21:14,070 --> 00:21:16,230
when you want to tell me someday,

373
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:18,110
you will do so.

374
00:21:20,270 --> 00:21:21,000
Alright.

375
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:29,960
The sunset is fading so quickly today.

376
00:21:31,110 --> 00:21:32,910
I wish it could last a bit longer.

377
00:21:33,510 --> 00:21:35,400
If you feel the sunset is too short,

378
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:36,350
next time,

379
00:21:37,510 --> 00:21:39,310
let's watch the stars together.

380
00:21:41,680 --> 00:21:42,440
Okay.

381
00:21:53,910 --> 00:22:01,980
[On July 7th, Bamboo Pavilion by River Huai]

382
00:22:19,640 --> 00:22:20,720
Guess what?

383
00:22:21,310 --> 00:22:23,880
He seemed like he was under the influence of
some kind of drug.

384
00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:26,100
He just ran off with her.

385
00:22:26,540 --> 00:22:27,240
Really?

386
00:22:27,240 --> 00:22:27,880
Is that true?

387
00:22:27,880 --> 00:22:28,510
Actually, it's like this...

388
00:22:28,510 --> 00:22:32,560
You guys are enjoying my anecdote
like this watermelon here, aren't you?

389
00:22:32,560 --> 00:22:34,420
You bet we are.

390
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:37,400
On July 7th, Bamboo Pavilion by River Huai.

391
00:22:38,030 --> 00:22:39,890
It sounds absolutely wonderful.

392
00:22:41,090 --> 00:22:43,110
How come you get watermelon seeds everywhere?

393
00:22:43,110 --> 00:22:45,070
Come on, have a seat.

394
00:22:45,070 --> 00:22:45,830
Sit.

395
00:22:48,310 --> 00:22:49,310
Move aside.

396
00:22:51,270 --> 00:22:52,110
So, how was it?

397
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:54,490
You've been out for a whole day.

398
00:22:54,550 --> 00:22:56,510
Did you have a pleasant time with Miss Huaizhu?

399
00:22:56,510 --> 00:22:58,510
Did you take off your mask already?

400
00:22:58,510 --> 00:23:00,000
Was Miss Huaizhu surprised or pleased?

401
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:03,130
Why don't you two go set up a stall
and perform some opera?

402
00:23:03,780 --> 00:23:04,990
That's not important.

403
00:23:04,990 --> 00:23:07,990
What's important is when you two
are getting married.

404
00:23:13,810 --> 00:23:16,010
Is your throat feeling uncomfortable?

405
00:23:19,190 --> 00:23:20,160
Hongye.

406
00:23:20,160 --> 00:23:21,400
Actually, we're here today

407
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:23,350
to report to you about Nangong Ye.

408
00:23:23,370 --> 00:23:25,310
Zizai, why are you changing the subject?

409
00:23:25,310 --> 00:23:26,270
We aren't done with this topic yet.

410
00:23:26,270 --> 00:23:27,240
That's right.

411
00:23:27,260 --> 00:23:28,770
When we were gossiping earlier,

412
00:23:28,770 --> 00:23:29,960
didn't you tell the story of

413
00:23:29,960 --> 00:23:32,200
the Dongfang Divine Fire
fighting the Poison King?

414
00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:34,310
You were so excited that your eyebrows
almost flew off your face.

415
00:23:34,310 --> 00:23:35,110
Was I?

416
00:23:35,240 --> 00:23:36,220
Yes, you were.

417
00:23:36,350 --> 00:23:37,190
Go on.

418
00:23:43,890 --> 00:23:45,280
Today,

419
00:23:45,630 --> 00:23:49,090
I did go to the Bamboo Pavilion by River Huai
with Miss Huaizhu.

420
00:23:49,790 --> 00:23:51,120
We got along

421
00:23:51,880 --> 00:23:53,200
very well indeed.

422
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:57,040
But I didn't take off my mask.

423
00:23:57,540 --> 00:23:59,680
Because the timing and atmosphere
weren't right.

424
00:23:59,680 --> 00:24:00,340
Satisfied?

425
00:24:01,220 --> 00:24:02,240
Boring.

426
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:05,090
Are you worried that Huaizhu

427
00:24:05,160 --> 00:24:07,420
won't like the real you beneath the mask?

428
00:24:07,740 --> 00:24:09,400
Hongye, don't be discouraged.

429
00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:10,550
As the saying goes,

430
00:24:10,590 --> 00:24:11,830
"A good woman can't resist a persistent man."

431
00:24:11,830 --> 00:24:13,890
"A vicious dog fears a sturdy stick."

432
00:24:16,610 --> 00:24:19,850
If you don't know how to finish my sentence,
don't force it, okay?

433
00:24:19,850 --> 00:24:22,450
Well, let's get back to the important matters.

434
00:24:39,820 --> 00:24:44,290
As they say, "The spirit like an orchid,
forever unchanging.

435
00:24:44,740 --> 00:24:46,930
The heart like an orchid..."

436
00:24:47,790 --> 00:24:48,790
What was it again?

437
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:51,180
Never mind, forget it.

438
00:24:54,790 --> 00:24:57,210
Huaizhu, you went to the Bamboo Pavilion by River Huai.

439
00:24:57,210 --> 00:25:01,420
You're quite satisfied with my
masked brother-in-law, right?

440
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:02,750
What does he look like?

441
00:25:07,020 --> 00:25:08,500
Is he very ugly?

442
00:25:09,880 --> 00:25:10,890
I didn't see him.

443
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:12,070
You didn't see him?

444
00:25:13,130 --> 00:25:15,990
Huaizhu, do you really not care about appearances?

445
00:25:16,230 --> 00:25:18,090
Appearance stems from the heart.

446
00:25:18,160 --> 00:25:19,830
I don't think he can be ugly.

447
00:25:21,510 --> 00:25:23,000
However, his mask...

448
00:25:25,070 --> 00:25:26,240
Is indeed very ugly.

449
00:25:31,400 --> 00:25:34,340
The Inspection Bureau should be
thoroughly investigated indeed.

450
00:25:34,340 --> 00:25:35,740
In recent years, behind the scenes,

451
00:25:35,740 --> 00:25:37,450
they have been using demon-controlling talismans.

452
00:25:37,450 --> 00:25:39,090
If these talismans fall into the hands of the Yiqi Alliance,

453
00:25:39,090 --> 00:25:40,520
we all know

454
00:25:40,550 --> 00:25:42,050
what the consequences will be.

455
00:25:42,050 --> 00:25:45,240
It's like the Nangong family using demon cores
to forge swords.

456
00:25:45,240 --> 00:25:46,660
It corrupts the mind

457
00:25:46,790 --> 00:25:48,400
and accelerates the killing
between humans and demons.

458
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:50,230
To thoroughly investigate the Inspection Bureau,

459
00:25:50,230 --> 00:25:51,780
we need to first clarify their channels

460
00:25:51,780 --> 00:25:53,750
for trading demon-controlling talismans.

461
00:25:53,750 --> 00:25:54,460
Also,

462
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:56,200
we need to keep investigating

463
00:25:56,200 --> 00:25:57,750
how the Nangong family learned

464
00:25:57,750 --> 00:25:58,750
to use demon cores in sword forging.

465
00:25:58,750 --> 00:25:59,750
Don't worry, Hongye.

466
00:25:59,750 --> 00:26:01,590
Quzhuo and I will handle this.

467
00:26:01,880 --> 00:26:03,240
As for you two, one is the Young Master Wangquan,

468
00:26:03,240 --> 00:26:04,550
and the other has a family wedding to attend.

469
00:26:04,550 --> 00:26:06,410
Your identities are too exposed.

470
00:26:08,270 --> 00:26:09,740
No, no, no.

471
00:26:09,830 --> 00:26:11,880
This won't do.

472
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:14,350
If Hongye keeps pursuing her like this,

473
00:26:14,350 --> 00:26:16,350
he'll still be wearing the mask
even when he's 70.

474
00:26:16,350 --> 00:26:18,030
They're clearly a match made in heaven.

475
00:26:18,030 --> 00:26:19,160
I won't accept this.

476
00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:21,640
There's still a chance, right?

477
00:26:21,640 --> 00:26:23,360
Miss Dongfang will surely attend

478
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:24,680
my aunt's wedding.

479
00:26:28,620 --> 00:26:30,230
That makes sense.

480
00:26:31,110 --> 00:26:33,550
It's time for us to lend a helping hand.

481
00:26:43,610 --> 00:26:45,150
Be careful, everyone.

482
00:26:48,850 --> 00:26:50,190
Slowly.

483
00:26:53,720 --> 00:26:54,790
Be careful.

484
00:26:55,500 --> 00:26:58,380
[Clairvoyant Yang Residence]

485
00:27:00,800 --> 00:27:03,210
You two little ones, don't run so fast.

486
00:27:03,920 --> 00:27:04,820
Slow down, slow down.

487
00:27:04,820 --> 00:27:05,550
Huaizhu.

488
00:27:06,020 --> 00:27:06,790
Huaizhu.

489
00:27:07,810 --> 00:27:10,020
The fruits and wedding cakes are all prepared.

490
00:27:10,020 --> 00:27:11,330
Everything has arrived.

491
00:27:11,330 --> 00:27:13,130
We're just missing some of Yan's

492
00:27:13,130 --> 00:27:14,510
headdresses and jewelry.

493
00:27:14,510 --> 00:27:16,740
We'll go to Ruyi Pavilion to purchase them tomorrow.

494
00:27:16,740 --> 00:27:17,270
Okay.

495
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:19,310
Miss Huaizhu.

496
00:27:20,440 --> 00:27:21,770
Young Master Wangquan.

497
00:27:24,690 --> 00:27:27,960
The way this Young Master Wangquan
looks at Huaizhu is strange.

498
00:27:27,960 --> 00:27:29,160
Miss Dongfang, you've come from afar

499
00:27:29,160 --> 00:27:30,980
and been helping my aunt
with wedding preparations.

500
00:27:30,980 --> 00:27:32,310
It must be quite tiring.

501
00:27:32,370 --> 00:27:33,970
Why don't you two ladies stay

502
00:27:34,070 --> 00:27:35,800
and join Young Master Wangquan

503
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:38,000
for a simple meal?

504
00:27:38,200 --> 00:27:39,920
Something's fishy.

505
00:27:43,920 --> 00:27:44,900
Sure.

506
00:27:46,270 --> 00:27:47,270
I'm hungry.

507
00:27:49,310 --> 00:27:50,640
Thank you for your trouble.

508
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:51,350
Not at all.

509
00:27:55,310 --> 00:27:56,400
Yitan, sit here.

510
00:27:57,030 --> 00:27:58,720
Miss Huaizhu, please.

511
00:27:58,920 --> 00:27:59,400
Hongye.

512
00:27:59,960 --> 00:28:00,690
Come on, sit.

513
00:28:01,750 --> 00:28:03,840
The feng shui here is really good.

514
00:28:04,090 --> 00:28:05,620
I'll sit here.

515
00:28:06,130 --> 00:28:08,260
You even care about feng shui at a meal?

516
00:28:08,280 --> 00:28:09,330
What an expert.

517
00:28:09,400 --> 00:28:10,960
Thank you for your flattery.

518
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:13,440
After all, many people have had designs on Huaizhu.

519
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:14,570
I'm used to it by now.

520
00:28:15,270 --> 00:28:16,830
My sister is carefree and straightforward.

521
00:28:16,830 --> 00:28:17,750
Please don't take any offense.

522
00:28:17,750 --> 00:28:18,550
It's alright.

523
00:28:19,310 --> 00:28:20,400
Zui, let's sit.

524
00:28:28,410 --> 00:28:30,000
The rest of us have met

525
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:31,310
at Nangong's residence before.

526
00:28:31,310 --> 00:28:33,070
Only Miss Qinlan is meeting us
for the first time.

527
00:28:33,070 --> 00:28:35,110
Let me make the introductions.

528
00:28:35,110 --> 00:28:35,920
No need.

529
00:28:35,920 --> 00:28:37,000
About what happened at Nangong's residence,

530
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:38,400
Huaizhu has already told me.

531
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:39,790
So I can match

532
00:28:39,790 --> 00:28:41,390
all your names to your faces.

533
00:28:41,830 --> 00:28:44,070
But since this is our first time
meeting in person,

534
00:28:44,070 --> 00:28:46,270
I shouldn't skip the proper etiquette.

535
00:28:46,350 --> 00:28:48,350
So I'll use tea instead of wine

536
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:50,400
and propose a toast to...

537
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:52,080
My dear nephew Yitan.

538
00:28:55,570 --> 00:28:56,720
Here's the thing.

539
00:28:56,740 --> 00:28:57,920
Yang Yan

540
00:28:57,920 --> 00:28:59,250
is my sister Huaizhu's best friend,

541
00:28:59,250 --> 00:29:01,550
and Yang Yan and I are of the same generation.

542
00:29:01,550 --> 00:29:02,660
Since she's your aunt,

543
00:29:02,660 --> 00:29:04,350
naturally, you're my nephew.

544
00:29:08,350 --> 00:29:09,410
Dear nephew Yitan.

545
00:29:19,550 --> 00:29:20,960
Dear nephew Hongye.

546
00:29:24,920 --> 00:29:25,720
Let's eat.

547
00:29:26,270 --> 00:29:28,430
There are many dishes you like.

548
00:29:28,770 --> 00:29:30,610
Eat more, talk less.

549
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:34,090
Well, humans are born with mouths.

550
00:29:34,420 --> 00:29:36,360
If we only eat and don't talk,

551
00:29:36,510 --> 00:29:38,710
how are we different from rice buckets?

552
00:29:42,620 --> 00:29:44,280
I'm not referring to you guys.

553
00:29:46,500 --> 00:29:48,560
Don't you agree, dear nephew Hongye?

554
00:29:50,200 --> 00:29:51,000
Indeed.

555
00:29:52,090 --> 00:29:54,030
Although you're the young master,

556
00:29:54,160 --> 00:29:55,920
Huaizhu is already spoken for.

557
00:29:55,920 --> 00:29:58,320
Don't even think about making a move on her.

558
00:30:01,350 --> 00:30:04,030
I wonder if you've all heard of

559
00:30:04,270 --> 00:30:05,640
the Mask Group?

560
00:30:09,960 --> 00:30:10,960
Never heard of it.

561
00:30:13,710 --> 00:30:14,960
As expected.

562
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:17,900
A mundane creature like Young Master Wangquan

563
00:30:17,960 --> 00:30:20,640
surely has never heard of
such an extraordinary person

564
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:22,110
as the Mask Group Leader.

565
00:30:22,310 --> 00:30:24,720
He's the one my sister has her heart set on.

566
00:30:27,350 --> 00:30:30,590
Anyway, some people are absolutely
incomparable to him.

567
00:30:32,110 --> 00:30:32,960
Huaizhu.

568
00:30:33,270 --> 00:30:34,800
You didn't peel the shrimp.

569
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:42,110
How exactly are some people
incomparable to him?

570
00:30:44,200 --> 00:30:47,350
The Mask Group Leader is chivalrous and righteous,

571
00:30:47,400 --> 00:30:49,030
but some people

572
00:30:49,030 --> 00:30:50,240
are vindictive.

573
00:30:50,780 --> 00:30:52,460
Although the Mask Group Leader

574
00:30:52,460 --> 00:30:54,110
wears a mask

575
00:30:54,110 --> 00:30:55,510
and dresses simply,

576
00:30:55,750 --> 00:30:56,960
he

577
00:30:57,070 --> 00:31:00,280
exudes an air of elegance and charm.

578
00:31:00,310 --> 00:31:01,920
Unlike some people

579
00:31:01,960 --> 00:31:04,160
who are clearly trying too hard.

580
00:31:07,170 --> 00:31:09,420
Moreover, his swordsmanship is
better than yours,

581
00:31:09,420 --> 00:31:10,550
he's taller than you,

582
00:31:10,550 --> 00:31:11,920
and he has a slimmer waist.

583
00:31:11,920 --> 00:31:14,380
You have absolutely no chance with Huaizhu.

584
00:31:20,070 --> 00:31:21,530
Zui, why are you giggling?

585
00:31:24,740 --> 00:31:26,030
I think

586
00:31:26,070 --> 00:31:28,610
Qinlan has a point.

587
00:31:28,630 --> 00:31:30,830
I never thought Hongye would see this day.

588
00:31:30,830 --> 00:31:31,850
This deserves a nice drink.

589
00:31:31,850 --> 00:31:33,530
Yitan, go get some wine.

590
00:31:34,350 --> 00:31:35,810
It's midday. Don't drink.

591
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:36,590
Yes.

592
00:31:37,350 --> 00:31:39,830
Authority is meant to be rebelled against.

593
00:31:39,830 --> 00:31:40,810
Dear nephew Yitan,

594
00:31:40,810 --> 00:31:42,400
stand up and go get the wine.

595
00:31:51,850 --> 00:31:53,060
The fish is good.

596
00:31:53,090 --> 00:31:54,690
Let's eat. Enjoy the dishes.

597
00:31:56,580 --> 00:31:58,110
Some people

598
00:31:58,130 --> 00:32:00,330
are so mean to their own siblings,

599
00:32:00,610 --> 00:32:02,210
not even letting them drink.

600
00:32:02,230 --> 00:32:03,070
It seems to me that apart from

601
00:32:03,070 --> 00:32:04,790
having the hyphenated name Wangquan,

602
00:32:04,790 --> 00:32:06,050
he has no other merits.

603
00:32:08,590 --> 00:32:10,750
Forget it. I'll stop talking. Let's eat.

604
00:32:10,750 --> 00:32:13,080
Come on, I'll propose a toast to everyone.

605
00:32:13,190 --> 00:32:14,290
Right. Come on.

606
00:32:14,340 --> 00:32:16,110
One glass for friendship, two for affection,

607
00:32:16,110 --> 00:32:17,590
and three make good friends.

608
00:32:17,590 --> 00:32:18,550
Cheers.

609
00:32:18,550 --> 00:32:19,010
Cheers.

610
00:32:28,270 --> 00:32:29,030
Look at you.

611
00:32:34,920 --> 00:32:36,160
Dear nephew Yitan.

612
00:32:36,550 --> 00:32:39,070
So what Qinlan meant during the meal

613
00:32:39,160 --> 00:32:41,270
was to declare the Mask Group Leader's allegiance

614
00:32:41,270 --> 00:32:43,880
and tell Hongye not to have any delusions?

615
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:45,730
That's what she meant, indeed.

616
00:32:46,840 --> 00:32:48,900
But aren't we of the same generation?

617
00:32:49,640 --> 00:32:50,830
That's not important.

618
00:32:50,830 --> 00:32:53,550
What's important is that
once the wedding is over,

619
00:32:53,550 --> 00:32:55,550
it'll be hard for Hongye
to have another chance.

620
00:32:55,550 --> 00:32:57,030
With Miss Qinlan around,

621
00:32:57,050 --> 00:32:58,380
it is indeed difficult.

622
00:32:58,650 --> 00:33:00,660
We need to make a plan.

623
00:33:00,760 --> 00:33:01,670
What plan?

624
00:33:02,160 --> 00:33:03,240
Early tomorrow morning,

625
00:33:03,240 --> 00:33:06,790
Miss Dongfang will go to Ruyi Pavilion
to purchase jewelry.

626
00:33:06,810 --> 00:33:07,810
And then?

627
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:10,490
Then we'll arrange for Hongye and Miss Dongfang

628
00:33:10,490 --> 00:33:12,350
to have a destined encounter.

629
00:33:12,380 --> 00:33:13,310
Attention here.

630
00:33:13,350 --> 00:33:17,480
We must elevate Hongye's image of
being free-spirited and unrestrained.

631
00:33:17,750 --> 00:33:18,750
I'll do as you say.

632
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:27,790
What's wrong?

633
00:33:27,960 --> 00:33:28,960
It's nothing, really.

634
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:29,960
It's just I heard that you particularly like

635
00:33:29,960 --> 00:33:31,960
candied hawthorn, Qinlan,

636
00:33:31,960 --> 00:33:34,160
so I specially bought you a stick.

637
00:33:38,520 --> 00:33:41,000
I didn't expect that you Wangquan family

638
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:42,510
would be so considerate.

639
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:43,830
Thanks.

640
00:33:53,110 --> 00:33:54,590
This candied hawthorn stick should be enough

641
00:33:54,590 --> 00:33:56,450
to make her sleep for a whole noon.

642
00:33:56,960 --> 00:33:58,420
How's it going on your end?

643
00:33:58,550 --> 00:34:00,110
Miss Dongfang has already left.

644
00:34:00,110 --> 00:34:01,030
What about Hongye?

645
00:34:01,030 --> 00:34:02,350
I told Hongye that my grandfather wanted

646
00:34:02,350 --> 00:34:04,570
to have a heart-to-heart talk with him,

647
00:34:04,640 --> 00:34:06,550
so he immediately ran away.

648
00:34:06,590 --> 00:34:08,110
He was going to Ruyi Pavilion
to see Fifth Sister.

649
00:34:08,110 --> 00:34:09,360
As expected of you, Yitan.

650
00:34:09,360 --> 00:34:10,630
Your timing is perfect.

651
00:34:10,630 --> 00:34:11,159
Let's go.

652
00:34:27,449 --> 00:34:28,310
How's it going?

653
00:34:29,199 --> 00:34:31,199
Miss Dongfang has already arrived.

654
00:34:31,780 --> 00:34:32,639
What about you?

655
00:34:32,679 --> 00:34:34,550
Have you arranged the person we need?

656
00:34:34,550 --> 00:34:35,730
It's all been arranged.

657
00:34:35,730 --> 00:34:39,270
Look, that Taoist priest will stop Miss Dongfang

658
00:34:39,350 --> 00:34:40,679
and ask her to draw a fortune stick.

659
00:34:40,679 --> 00:34:41,880
Miss, please wait.

660
00:34:41,100 --> 00:34:46,520
[Nanhu Inn]

661
00:34:43,030 --> 00:34:45,110
I see a peach blossom flush on your face,

662
00:34:45,110 --> 00:34:46,909
as if your love star is in motion.

663
00:34:47,860 --> 00:34:50,630
I have iron fortune sticks here
that can determine love fates,

664
00:34:50,630 --> 00:34:52,630
but they only work for those
destined to be together.

665
00:34:52,630 --> 00:34:55,230
Miss, would you like to have your fortune told?

666
00:34:55,230 --> 00:34:56,280
[Nanhu Inn]

667
00:34:55,690 --> 00:34:56,360
Miss.

668
00:34:56,380 --> 00:35:00,260
In this vast world, isn't there anyone
you care about?

669
00:35:11,960 --> 00:35:14,610
Don't worry, no matter how she shakes it,

670
00:35:14,630 --> 00:35:16,840
she will only draw that destined fortune stick.

671
00:35:16,840 --> 00:35:19,020
It will fall at Hongye's feet,

672
00:35:19,040 --> 00:35:20,810
and only he can pick it up.

673
00:35:20,890 --> 00:35:22,750
Here he comes. Here comes Hongye.

674
00:35:24,070 --> 00:35:25,080

Young Master Wangquan.

676
00:35:30,510 --> 00:35:32,860
Huaizhu, why didn't you take me
shopping with you?

677
00:35:32,860 --> 00:35:33,840
Why is she here?

678
00:35:33,840 --> 00:35:34,960
I swear that candied hawthorn stick

679
00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:36,760
could even knock you out.

680

[Nanhu Inn]

681
00:35:39,110 --> 00:35:39,710
You dropped your fortune stick.

Let me pick it up for you.

683
00:36:00,230 --> 00:36:02,320
You two are outstanding individuals,

684
00:36:02,320 --> 00:36:03,920
truly chosen by heaven.

685
00:36:04,660 --> 00:36:07,590
You are destined to be together
in three lifetimes.

686
00:36:07,840 --> 00:36:09,360
You haven't even read what's written
on the fortune stick.

687
00:36:09,360 --> 00:36:11,890
How do you know we're destined
to be together?

688
00:36:15,320 --> 00:36:17,510
Only bamboo conceals a golden blade.

689

With apricot, there's no need for plum.

690

Forming a bond brings wealth and honor.

691
00:36:22,280 --> 00:36:24,740
Heaven grants its convenience.

692
00:36:24,880 --> 00:36:25,920
Miss, look.

693
00:36:26,260 --> 00:36:28,800
If this isn't heaven's choice, what is?

694
00:36:29,320 --> 00:36:32,030
This fortune stick is indeed
the best of the best,

695
00:36:32,030 --> 00:36:33,230
but as for the person,

696
00:36:33,790 --> 00:36:35,020
I'm not worthy.

697
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:37,710

I don't understand what you're saying, Sir.

700
00:36:49,320 --> 00:36:51,510
But your destined romance

701

Did you bring the Wind and Rain Talisman
with you?

Rest assured.

That fortune stick also fell
in such a strange way.

with the candied hawthorn stick.

Please feel free to browse and select, everyone.

733
00:39:23,890 --> 00:39:28,870
[Qingmu Yuan, the Mask Group's Side]

734
00:39:31,960 --> 00:39:32,840
Miss Qingmu.

735
00:39:33,010 --> 00:39:35,740
The guest I'm expecting should be arriving soon.

736
00:39:36,070 --> 00:39:37,150
Is everything ready?

737
00:39:37,150 --> 00:39:38,000
Yes.

738
00:39:38,110 --> 00:39:39,040
All in position.

739
00:39:41,510 --> 00:39:43,720
Miss Qingmu, look.

740
00:39:55,320 --> 00:39:56,650
Young Master Wangquan?

741
00:39:59,320 --> 00:40:00,720
Young Master Wangquan!

742
00:40:10,150 --> 00:40:11,280
Where did this young gentleman come from?

743
00:40:11,280 --> 00:40:12,730
He's so handsome and elegant.

744
00:40:12,730 --> 00:40:13,800
Indeed he is.

745
00:40:13,800 --> 00:40:16,870
This is Wangquan Hongye, Young Master
of the Yiqi Alliance.

746
00:40:16,870 --> 00:40:19,670
I didn't expect Wangquan Hongye
to be so handsome.

747
00:40:20,510 --> 00:40:22,070
He's stolen my heart in the blink of an eye.

748
00:40:22,070 --> 00:40:23,400
These ladies

749
00:40:23,400 --> 00:40:26,430
can actually see past Young Master's
disheveled appearance

750
00:40:26,430 --> 00:40:28,810
and observe his unique celestial charm.

751
00:40:29,320 --> 00:40:30,850
That's really impressive.

752
00:40:38,560 --> 00:40:39,890
Young Master Wangquan.

753
00:40:40,210 --> 00:40:42,290
The items you ordered have all arrived.

754
00:40:42,290 --> 00:40:43,750
Please follow me to the second floor
to take a look.
