00:02:03,590 --> 00:02:04,620
Yitan,

4
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:06,720
it's time to take your medicine.

5
00:02:26,190 --> 00:02:27,590
The storybook says

6
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:29,700
mouth-to-mouth feeding will do.

7
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:56,960
What a ridiculous storybook.

8
00:02:56,960 --> 00:03:00,360
I can't believe I thought I could
feed him medicine like this.

9
00:03:04,430 --> 00:03:05,480
This won't do.

10
00:03:05,710 --> 00:03:08,320
I'll have to try anything at this point.

11
00:03:19,190 --> 00:03:20,340

00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:21,400
wake up.

13
00:03:31,230 --> 00:03:33,430
His consciousness is weak, so it's indeed
easier to control.

14
00:03:33,430 --> 00:03:34,060

we're bound to lose.

If I were to show my real strength,

84
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:11,760
would you dare to face it?

85
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:14,230
Why wouldn't I dare?

86
00:07:20,390 --> 00:07:21,920
It's your turn now, Hongye.

Let's bet on who can form hand seals faster.

88
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:25,960
You're a swordsman,

89
00:07:26,310 --> 00:07:28,440
so you probably aren't very good at it.

90
00:07:37,159 --> 00:07:37,950
Alright.

91
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:53,120
You lost.

92
00:07:55,850 --> 00:07:56,770
I told you

93
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:58,450
you could control fire.

94
00:08:04,710 --> 00:08:05,710
You're cheating!

95
00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:07,160
You can cheat,

96
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:08,980
so why can't we?

97
00:08:09,170 --> 00:08:11,100
I, Jia Lan, have never lost before.

98
00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:13,340
I will poison both of you to death!

99
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:42,390
So it's you.

100
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:45,800
Very well.

101
00:08:46,250 --> 00:08:47,510
I'm really satisfied.

102
00:08:50,190 --> 00:08:51,020
Follow me.

103
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:54,270
Jia Lan.

104
00:08:56,270 --> 00:08:57,630
You've recognized her.

105
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:01,760
Is it beautiful here?

106
00:09:03,270 --> 00:09:03,960
It is.

107
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:06,700
Such a perfunctory response.

108
00:09:06,700 --> 00:09:08,510
Are you that eager to leave?

109
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:10,790
How should we leave?

110
00:09:10,810 --> 00:09:12,700
You only won one round against me.

111
00:09:12,790 --> 00:09:13,720
So,

112
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:15,520
only one of you can leave.

113
00:09:19,770 --> 00:09:21,430
I will use all my demonic power

114
00:09:21,550 --> 00:09:23,290
to send you to a place.

115
00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:25,030
There, you will...

116
00:09:25,510 --> 00:09:26,440
Kill each other.

117
00:09:30,450 --> 00:09:31,900
Either

118
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:33,040
you both die,

119
00:09:33,670 --> 00:09:34,920
or

120
00:09:34,970 --> 00:09:37,720
one of you kills the other

121
00:09:37,790 --> 00:09:39,110
and leaves here alive.

122
00:09:40,850 --> 00:09:42,470
Who will be the one

123
00:09:43,390 --> 00:09:44,720
that leaves here alive?

124
00:10:02,490 --> 00:10:03,720
What is this place?

125
00:10:04,390 --> 00:10:05,440
July 7th.

126
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,730
Bamboo Pavilion by River Huai.

127
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:10,000
This place is very important to

128
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,030
both of us.

129
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:14,000
So I guess this is

130
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:17,580
the depths of our consciousness.

131
00:10:23,990 --> 00:10:25,720
Is Dongfang Huaizhu

132
00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:27,750
the one you chose, Lord Jiuhuo?

133
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,960
To be precise, she was chosen by you.

134
00:10:31,390 --> 00:10:32,150
Jia Lan.

135
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:34,840
Why did you create this illusion?

136
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:36,840
Do you know that when your

137
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:39,640
demonic energy is exhausted, you will disappear?

138
00:10:39,790 --> 00:10:41,990
The mandala flower represents hatred.

139
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:44,720
Although you've cleansed her memory, My Lord,

140
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:46,650
Dongfang Huaizhu still holds love

141
00:10:46,670 --> 00:10:47,750
in her heart.

142
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:49,910
You want them to kill their beloved

143
00:10:49,910 --> 00:10:51,760
in the place of

144
00:10:52,030 --> 00:10:53,490
their happiest memories?

145
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:55,440
Only in this way can

146
00:10:55,630 --> 00:10:59,120
the mandala flower completely occupy her soul.

147
00:10:59,750 --> 00:11:00,800
Only then can she

148
00:11:00,870 --> 00:11:03,510
become a truly worthy vessel.

149
00:11:04,790 --> 00:11:06,990
The Golden Dawn is about to be restored.

150
00:11:07,340 --> 00:11:09,150
Wait for me to break through the Boundary.

151
00:11:09,150 --> 00:11:10,360
Once you break through it,

152
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:11,960
the true Jia Lan will return.

153
00:11:12,270 --> 00:11:13,950
We will take back everything

154
00:11:14,870 --> 00:11:16,150
that everyone owes us.

155
00:11:23,150 --> 00:11:24,720
Telling stories again?

156
00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:26,480
If it were a story,

157
00:11:26,590 --> 00:11:28,910
how could you have the ability to control fire?

158
00:11:28,910 --> 00:11:30,200
Do you really have no recollection

159
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:31,600
of that Divine Fire mark?

160
00:11:39,250 --> 00:11:40,790
Between you and me, it doesn't
have to be this way.

161
00:11:40,790 --> 00:11:41,810
Between you and me,

162
00:11:41,810 --> 00:11:43,870
it's destined that only one can live.

163
00:12:17,150 --> 00:12:18,870
If you were willing to kill me,

164
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:20,700
you would have done it long ago.

165
00:12:20,700 --> 00:12:22,320
But if you use the Divine Fire,

166
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:23,980
I may not be able to defeat you.

167
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:25,390
Alright.

168
00:12:26,610 --> 00:12:28,000
Put the sword away,

169
00:12:28,580 --> 00:12:29,840
and let's fight again.

170
00:12:35,100 --> 00:12:36,590
This is the illusion of the heart.

171
00:12:36,590 --> 00:12:37,770
If we die here,

172
00:12:38,020 --> 00:12:40,220
our consciousness will sleep forever.

173
00:12:40,910 --> 00:12:43,910
We'll become living dead, no different from the dead.

174
00:12:46,510 --> 00:12:47,970
Then what's stopping you?

175
00:12:48,340 --> 00:12:50,390
If one of us must die,

176
00:12:52,030 --> 00:12:53,430
that person won't be you.

177
00:12:57,270 --> 00:12:58,320
So,

178
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,790
you're willing to die for me?

179
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:03,960
I won't die for you.

180
00:13:04,550 --> 00:13:05,750
I want us both to live.

181
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:07,500
Come with me to a place.

182
00:13:18,630 --> 00:13:19,550
Where is this?

183
00:13:24,030 --> 00:13:25,760
We once watched the sunset here

184
00:13:26,690 --> 00:13:27,910
together.

185
00:13:36,970 --> 00:13:38,630
The sun is setting

186
00:13:39,030 --> 00:13:40,080
so quickly today.

187
00:13:42,030 --> 00:13:43,830
I wish it could last a bit longer.

188
00:13:44,750 --> 00:13:46,610
If you feel the sunset is too short,

189
00:13:46,610 --> 00:13:47,920
next time,

190
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:50,920
let's watch the stars together.

191
00:13:53,320 --> 00:13:54,080
Sure.

192
00:14:14,970 --> 00:14:15,520
Do you...

193
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,200
Remember something?

194
00:14:22,870 --> 00:14:23,440
I...

195
00:14:26,940 --> 00:14:28,170
Remember now.

196
00:14:30,910 --> 00:14:31,790
What...

197
00:14:32,910 --> 00:14:33,840
Do you remember?

198
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:39,320
This place is...

199
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:52,720
I remember now.

200
00:14:53,720 --> 00:14:56,090
This is where you'll be buried.

201
00:15:02,270 --> 00:15:03,120
Remember,

202
00:15:05,240 --> 00:15:07,150
you are Dongfang Huaizhu.

203
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:10,340
You must not trust Jiuhuo.

204
00:15:32,900 --> 00:15:34,360
Wangquan Hongye.

205
00:15:34,690 --> 00:15:35,970
Lord Jiuhuo.

206
00:15:36,970 --> 00:15:38,310
I don't trust anyone.

207
00:15:39,390 --> 00:15:41,460
I only trust myself.

208
00:16:03,130 --> 00:16:04,440
What will happen to him?

209
00:16:04,440 --> 00:16:07,340
Oh, he was killed by you in the illusion.

210
00:16:07,550 --> 00:16:09,730
He will be forever trapped in the nightmare,

211
00:16:09,730 --> 00:16:11,010
never to wake up again.

212
00:16:13,750 --> 00:16:15,610
What? Are you reluctant to let go?

213
00:16:16,990 --> 00:16:18,070
How could I be?

214
00:16:18,750 --> 00:16:20,290
He's already gone.

215
00:16:20,390 --> 00:16:22,790
In the end, your own life is more important.

216
00:16:22,790 --> 00:16:23,630
Huaizhu.

217
00:16:23,750 --> 00:16:25,180
You should move on.

218
00:16:25,270 --> 00:16:26,510
I've already won.

219
00:16:26,710 --> 00:16:27,900
Can I leave now?

220
00:16:30,870 --> 00:16:34,400
Huaizhu, stay with me a little longer
to enjoy the scenery here.

221
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:35,790
I'm not a real entity.

222
00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:38,910
I'm just a shadow created by Jia Lan with her

223
00:16:38,960 --> 00:16:41,490
demonic energy when she left Mount Xuankong.

224
00:16:41,720 --> 00:16:43,320
I'm about to dissipate.

225
00:16:43,550 --> 00:16:44,860
Once I'm gone,

226
00:16:45,030 --> 00:16:48,000
the barrier of Mount Xuankong will naturally break.

227
00:16:49,850 --> 00:16:51,850
Just admiring the scenery is no fun.

228
00:16:52,390 --> 00:16:54,070
I'd like to hear the story

229
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:56,220
between you and Lord Jiuhuo.

230
00:16:56,670 --> 00:16:57,720
Why?

231
00:16:57,840 --> 00:17:00,750
You don't seem like the type to pry, Huaizhu.

232
00:17:01,390 --> 00:17:02,390
Because

233
00:17:02,840 --> 00:17:03,970
we are very similar.

234
00:17:04,550 --> 00:17:06,000
And I want to know

235
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:09,030
if Lord Jiuhuo is worth following.

236
00:17:09,550 --> 00:17:10,640
Of course he is.

237
00:17:11,270 --> 00:17:13,470
Lord Jiuhuo is the only one in this world

238
00:17:13,790 --> 00:17:15,200
who loves us.

239
00:17:16,310 --> 00:17:17,400
The only one?

240
00:17:20,750 --> 00:17:24,109
Your appearance is quite pleasing.

241
00:17:25,160 --> 00:17:26,369
That's because

242
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:28,160
I was born evil.

243
00:17:28,590 --> 00:17:30,110
I am the legendary evil fox

244
00:17:30,350 --> 00:17:32,790
born from the resentment

245
00:17:33,640 --> 00:17:35,100
between heaven and earth.

246
00:17:36,270 --> 00:17:37,750
You probably know

247
00:17:38,280 --> 00:17:40,860
there's a huge Grief Tree in Tushan.

248
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:44,110
The most powerful fox demons in Tushan

249
00:17:44,140 --> 00:17:45,590
are all orphans,

250
00:17:45,750 --> 00:17:47,240
born from the Grief Tree.

251
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:51,220
It's said that I was different from
other fox demons at birth.

252
00:17:51,540 --> 00:17:53,720
I was completely black.

253
00:17:54,040 --> 00:17:55,440
My demonic energy was extremely strong.

254
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:57,570
I took human form as soon as I turned 10.

255
00:17:57,920 --> 00:17:58,680
Unlike those

256
00:17:58,680 --> 00:18:00,910
fox demons who like flowers and plants,

257
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:04,740
I was naturally drawn to darkness and death.

258
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:06,750
The elders of Tushan

259
00:18:06,750 --> 00:18:08,610
quickly noticed my differences.

260
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:11,000
They divined my fate

261
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,810
and told my fortune.

262
00:18:12,830 --> 00:18:15,110
They said I was born from the resentment
between heaven and earth,

263
00:18:15,110 --> 00:18:16,880
a born devil,

264
00:18:17,030 --> 00:18:19,150
destined to destroy the world.

265
00:18:19,270 --> 00:18:21,550
So they sent me to

266
00:18:21,550 --> 00:18:24,080
Jiqing Cliff, which is over 300 miles away from Tushan.

267
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:25,740
They set up a barrier to trap me

268
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:28,000
and gave me a seed from the Grief Tree.

269
00:18:28,830 --> 00:18:30,070
They lied to me, saying

270
00:18:30,070 --> 00:18:32,220
as long as I could grow a Grief Tree,

271
00:18:32,470 --> 00:18:33,860
I would gain my freedom.

272
00:18:34,070 --> 00:18:35,030
In the end,

273
00:18:35,050 --> 00:18:36,540
with my hatred,

274
00:18:36,560 --> 00:18:39,760
I grew a Black Grief Tree.

275
00:18:41,630 --> 00:18:42,920
My power also grew

276
00:18:42,920 --> 00:18:45,290
along with this giant tree full of hatred.

277
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,220
I waited for them at Jiqing Cliff.

278
00:18:49,980 --> 00:18:52,190
I want them to know that

279
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:56,790
those who wrong me,

280
00:18:56,820 --> 00:18:59,750
I will repay in kind.

281
00:19:01,250 --> 00:19:03,470
[Jia Lan, juvenile form, fox demon]

282
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:26,420
Who are you?

283
00:19:27,830 --> 00:19:28,980
These demons...

284
00:19:31,260 --> 00:19:32,860
Were they all killed by you?

285
00:19:35,780 --> 00:19:37,290
Interesting.

286
00:19:38,330 --> 00:19:39,540
However,

287
00:19:39,570 --> 00:19:41,900
many fox demons will come to kill you soon.

288
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:48,060
I am Jiuhuo, a celestial demon of the Netherworld Clan.

289
00:19:48,590 --> 00:19:49,800
Come with me.

290
00:19:54,510 --> 00:19:57,220
Do you think they deserved to die?

291
00:19:57,450 --> 00:19:58,780
It wasn't unjustified.

292
00:19:58,980 --> 00:20:00,120
How nice.

293
00:20:00,780 --> 00:20:02,800
Besides Lord Jiuhuo,

294
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:05,540
there's another person who understands me now.

295
00:20:06,220 --> 00:20:08,330
They wanted to imprison me for life.

296
00:20:09,090 --> 00:20:11,200
Why shouldn't I kill them all?

297
00:20:13,100 --> 00:20:16,100
So what happened to you after that?

298
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:18,890
Why are you only left with a shadow?

299
00:20:19,960 --> 00:20:21,200
Did Lord Jiuhuo

300
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:24,310
repair the Golden Dawn for your sake?

301
00:20:26,690 --> 00:20:28,690
You've got quite a lot of questions,

302
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:30,550
but I'm running out of time.

303
00:20:31,340 --> 00:20:33,150
You're about to disappear.

304
00:20:33,480 --> 00:20:36,740
Is Lord Jiuhuo just going to watch without doing anything?

305
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:40,350
He promised me.

306
00:20:41,850 --> 00:20:43,520
He won't watch me disappear.

307
00:20:45,090 --> 00:20:46,330
We'll meet again.

308
00:20:51,390 --> 00:20:52,460
That's perfect.

309
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:00,130
Rather than letting you dissipate,

310
00:21:00,130 --> 00:21:02,420
why not give your power to me?

311
00:21:14,170 --> 00:21:15,420
What a pity.

312
00:21:16,260 --> 00:21:18,280
I do like to hear stories,

313
00:21:18,750 --> 00:21:21,270
but I'm never moved by others' tales.

314
00:21:47,920 --> 00:21:50,010
Wangquan Hongye.

315
00:21:54,510 --> 00:21:56,440
The moment you died for me

316
00:21:57,070 --> 00:21:58,800
was actually quite beautiful.

317
00:22:23,590 --> 00:22:24,640
Lord Jiuhuo.

318
00:22:25,980 --> 00:22:27,200
What's going on?

319
00:22:27,890 --> 00:22:31,280
A piece of the Golden Dawn is still missing.

320
00:22:32,230 --> 00:22:33,430
It's all my fault.

321
00:22:33,640 --> 00:22:35,900
A leech demon that I've been cultivating
for a long time

322
00:22:35,900 --> 00:22:38,360
somehow retained its consciousness

323
00:22:38,430 --> 00:22:40,490
and escaped from the Golden Dawn Inn.

324
00:22:40,600 --> 00:22:42,420
Such a major incident occurred,

325
00:22:42,510 --> 00:22:43,980
and you're only telling me now?

326
00:22:43,980 --> 00:22:47,460
The Seven-Star Alignment will end in seven days.

327
00:22:47,490 --> 00:22:48,850
Please don't worry, My Lord.

328
00:22:48,850 --> 00:22:50,590
I've sent people to search the entire city.

329
00:22:50,590 --> 00:22:51,920
We'll find it in no time.

330
00:22:58,250 --> 00:22:59,480
If you can't find it,

331
00:22:59,650 --> 00:23:01,870
I'll use you as a replacement.

332
00:23:02,750 --> 00:23:03,550
Yes, My Lord.

333
00:23:10,090 --> 00:23:11,980
Has the Left Guardian returned?

334
00:23:12,300 --> 00:23:13,510
Yes, he has.

335
00:23:13,640 --> 00:23:14,570
He's in his room.

336
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:41,790
[Cuiyu Mingluan, Elder of the Leech Clan]

337
00:23:53,680 --> 00:23:54,270
Who is it?

338
00:24:33,230 --> 00:24:34,950
[Mu Mie, Mu Xiaowu's son]

339
00:24:35,070 --> 00:24:36,720
Excuse me, Miss...

340
00:24:43,450 --> 00:24:44,080
Miss.

341
00:24:45,020 --> 00:24:45,660
Miss?

342
00:24:49,590 --> 00:24:51,400
Miss, I mean no harm.

343
00:24:51,960 --> 00:24:53,400
I apologize for startling you earlier, Miss.

344
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:54,680
I'm truly sorry.

345
00:24:54,870 --> 00:24:57,260
I just wanted to ask for directions.

346
00:24:59,030 --> 00:24:59,830
Miss!

347
00:25:12,830 --> 00:25:14,160
The Eye of Water Spirit?

348
00:25:14,570 --> 00:25:15,410
Miss,

349
00:25:15,970 --> 00:25:17,310
are you a healer from the demon realm?

350
00:25:17,310 --> 00:25:18,570
The Leech Clan, right?

351
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:20,060
Clairvoyance?

352
00:25:23,070 --> 00:25:24,000
Sir,

353
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:26,460
where are you heading?

354
00:25:27,550 --> 00:25:29,220
Miss, I hope you wouldn't mind telling me

355
00:25:29,220 --> 00:25:31,630
how to get to the Golden Dawn Inn.

356
00:25:36,440 --> 00:25:38,480
Miss, what's wrong?

357
00:25:39,780 --> 00:25:41,680
Why do you want to go to the Golden Dawn Inn?

358
00:25:41,680 --> 00:25:43,910
Is it absolutely necessary for you to go there?

359
00:25:43,910 --> 00:25:45,570
Because there are some things

360
00:25:45,820 --> 00:25:47,650
I must go there to figure out.

361
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:51,340
So I hope you can kindly give me some guidance, Miss.

362
00:25:55,120 --> 00:25:57,280
Go 1.6 miles north from here,

363
00:25:57,510 --> 00:25:59,080
then 3.3 miles west,

364
00:25:59,190 --> 00:26:01,030
then walk north past a village,

365
00:26:01,050 --> 00:26:02,640
then 3.3 miles east, and you'll...

366
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:03,480
Miss,

367
00:26:04,170 --> 00:26:06,370
could you slow down a bit?

368
00:26:06,440 --> 00:26:08,970
Then walk 3.3 miles east, and you'll be there.

369
00:26:13,790 --> 00:26:14,640
Thank you.

370
00:26:20,410 --> 00:26:22,070
Why did she leave so suddenly?

371
00:26:26,490 --> 00:26:28,080
Still, thank you, Miss.

372
00:26:37,460 --> 00:26:38,910
You must remember,

373
00:26:39,630 --> 00:26:41,570
you are Dongfang Huaizhu.

374
00:26:42,140 --> 00:26:43,190
You must

375
00:26:44,260 --> 00:26:46,540
not believe Jiuhuo.

376
00:26:57,050 --> 00:26:59,030
Why is my demonic aura

377
00:26:59,030 --> 00:27:00,690
exactly the same as Jia Lan's?

378
00:27:09,720 --> 00:27:10,630
Very well.

379
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:12,310
I'm really satisfied.

380
00:27:14,150 --> 00:27:15,960
Who exactly is Jia Lan?

381
00:27:16,980 --> 00:27:18,270
Why was she satisfied?

382
00:27:20,870 --> 00:27:22,160
Now that you're back,

383
00:27:22,440 --> 00:27:24,040
why didn't you come to see me?

384
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:25,510
Are you angry at me

385
00:27:25,510 --> 00:27:26,960
for not rescuing you from the barrier

386
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:28,020
of Mount Xuankong?

387
00:27:29,270 --> 00:27:30,340
How could I be?

388
00:27:31,030 --> 00:27:33,160
You just trust me, My Lord, that's all.

389
00:27:33,520 --> 00:27:34,880
And there, My Lord,

390
00:27:34,900 --> 00:27:36,860
I met your former disciple,

391
00:27:37,510 --> 00:27:38,270
Jia Lan.

392
00:27:39,310 --> 00:27:40,680
That was just a shadow.

393
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:44,880
But the demonic aura in my body

394
00:27:44,900 --> 00:27:47,720
clearly comes from the same source as Jia Lan's shadow.

395
00:27:47,720 --> 00:27:50,520
Don't you think you owe me an explanation, My Lord?

396
00:27:53,540 --> 00:27:55,580
Back in the chaotic times of human-demon conflict,

397
00:27:55,580 --> 00:27:57,040
when I found you,

398
00:27:57,070 --> 00:27:58,790
you were already on the brink of death.

399
00:27:58,790 --> 00:28:01,750
I injected Jia Lan's demonic energy into your body.

400
00:28:02,590 --> 00:28:04,310
However, her demonic aura was too strong.

401
00:28:04,310 --> 00:28:06,560
After you regained your demonic energy,

402
00:28:06,560 --> 00:28:08,190
you forgot your past.

403
00:28:08,440 --> 00:28:11,090
So what was my identity before
I lost my memory?

404
00:28:11,990 --> 00:28:15,600
Is it possible...
That I did know Wangquan Hongye?

405
00:28:19,790 --> 00:28:21,110
I don't know about that.

406
00:28:21,110 --> 00:28:21,960
However,

407
00:28:22,020 --> 00:28:24,420
humans have always coveted demonic power,

408
00:28:24,780 --> 00:28:26,780
wanting to tame and control demons.

409
00:28:26,840 --> 00:28:28,040
They are full of lies.

410
00:28:29,510 --> 00:28:30,920
You should know this.

411
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:34,130
Of course, I won't easily believe him.

412
00:28:34,400 --> 00:28:35,440
It's just...

413
00:28:37,550 --> 00:28:38,510
Just what?

414
00:28:41,330 --> 00:28:43,190
Your power is boundless, My Lord.

415
00:28:43,350 --> 00:28:46,480
The time you spent with Jia Lan must have
been very happy.

416
00:28:46,750 --> 00:28:49,590
I'm curious about the story between you two.

417
00:28:52,170 --> 00:28:54,100
After I took Jia Lan as my disciple,

418
00:28:54,340 --> 00:28:57,390
the Dragon Clan and the Tushan Clan joined forces to attack me.

419
00:28:57,390 --> 00:28:58,910
During one battle,

420
00:28:59,460 --> 00:29:01,720
my demon core got completely destroyed.

421
00:29:02,020 --> 00:29:03,020
But she,

422
00:29:03,050 --> 00:29:04,720
single-handedly,

423
00:29:04,740 --> 00:29:06,340
slayed dragons for me.

424
00:29:08,120 --> 00:29:10,100
[Dragon Emperor of the True Dragon Clan]

425
00:29:12,420 --> 00:29:14,180
What kind of wild demon are you?

426
00:29:13,680 --> 00:29:15,540
[Jia Lan, fox demon]

427
00:29:14,560 --> 00:29:16,970
What grudge do you have against me?

428
00:29:53,950 --> 00:29:55,820
She brought back the dragon core

429
00:29:56,080 --> 00:29:58,650
and used it to restore my demonic energy.

430
00:29:58,850 --> 00:30:00,610
From that day on,

431
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:02,390
we both realized

432
00:30:02,750 --> 00:30:05,010
we were each other's only one.

433
00:30:05,480 --> 00:30:06,790
But the good times didn't last long.

434
00:30:06,790 --> 00:30:08,110
500 years ago,

435
00:30:08,130 --> 00:30:10,960
Jia Lan's dark demonic power that could
command other demons

436
00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:13,620
caught the eye of the ruler
of the Beast Kingdom.

437
00:30:13,930 --> 00:30:15,240
They set a trap,

438
00:30:15,260 --> 00:30:17,080
injured and captured me.

439
00:30:17,590 --> 00:30:19,140
To save me, Jia Lan

440
00:30:19,890 --> 00:30:22,310
went to the Beast Kingdom dungeon alone.

441
00:30:25,610 --> 00:30:28,220
500 years ago, at the Beast Kingdom dungeon,

442
00:30:28,690 --> 00:30:30,080
what exactly happened between you

443
00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:31,480
and Jia Lan, My Lord?

444
00:30:34,130 --> 00:30:35,300
Jia Lan!

445
00:30:36,150 --> 00:30:37,280
This memory

446
00:30:37,300 --> 00:30:40,140
is something I never want to recount.

447
00:30:41,720 --> 00:30:44,190
Anyway, everything I'm doing now

448
00:30:44,220 --> 00:30:46,460
is to bring Jia Lan back.

449
00:30:48,300 --> 00:30:50,250
My Lord, so you mean

450
00:30:50,330 --> 00:30:51,690
Jia Lan is still alive?

451
00:30:51,950 --> 00:30:52,640
Of course.

452
00:30:53,810 --> 00:30:55,940
But she's blocked beyond the Boundary

453
00:30:56,150 --> 00:30:57,350
and can't come in yet.

454
00:30:57,510 --> 00:30:58,810
What a pity.

455
00:30:58,940 --> 00:31:00,300
I'm not Jia Lan,

456
00:31:00,550 --> 00:31:02,150
and I can't help you, My Lord.

457
00:31:02,380 --> 00:31:03,440
It doesn't matter.

458
00:31:03,620 --> 00:31:04,820
Jia Lan is Jia Lan,

459
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:05,860
and you are you.

460
00:31:06,270 --> 00:31:08,570
You only need to be yourself.

461
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:11,110
Don't think too much about anything else.

462
00:31:11,110 --> 00:31:13,030
As for that Wangquan Hongye...

463
00:31:13,110 --> 00:31:14,510
He's already dead.

464
00:31:15,470 --> 00:31:17,070
He was just a man who extracted
demon cores to forge swords,

465
00:31:17,070 --> 00:31:19,600
a bloodstained human from the Yiqi Alliance.

466
00:31:20,050 --> 00:31:22,370
All he wanted was my demonic power.

467
00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:24,160
His death is no loss.

468
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:30,920
This is all in the past.

469
00:31:31,680 --> 00:31:33,940
You don't have to think about it anymore.

470
00:31:34,910 --> 00:31:35,950
Yes.

471
00:31:36,770 --> 00:31:38,160
My Lord Jiuhuo.
