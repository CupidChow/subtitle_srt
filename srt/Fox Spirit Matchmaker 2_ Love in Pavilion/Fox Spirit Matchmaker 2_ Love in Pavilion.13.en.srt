[Episode 13]

3
00:01:57,460 --> 00:01:58,820
Head south?

4
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:02,980
Head south for fifteen miles,

5
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:05,320
then cross three mountains to the west.

6
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:07,400
That's right.

7
00:02:07,710 --> 00:02:08,940
Head south for fifteen miles,

8
00:02:08,940 --> 00:02:11,140
then cross three mountains to the west.

9
00:02:21,310 --> 00:02:22,910
Head west for fifteen miles,

10
00:02:23,050 --> 00:02:25,310
then cross three mountains to the south.

11
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:54,990
The dreams of the Clairvoyant Eye

12
00:02:54,990 --> 00:02:56,320
are all real.

13
00:02:59,190 --> 00:03:00,920
What exactly did he go through?

14
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:04,020
Why did he gouge out his own Clairvoyant Eye?

15
00:03:05,700 --> 00:03:07,280
Sky City is where humans and demons gather,

16
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:08,960
and information travels fastest there.

17
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:11,240
Maybe I can find the information I need there.

18
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:12,250
No matter what,

19
00:03:13,630 --> 00:03:14,960
I must find him.

20
00:04:06,050 --> 00:04:07,440
Wangquan Hongye.

21
00:04:11,310 --> 00:04:15,120
You said Lord Jiuhuo erased my memories

22
00:04:15,140 --> 00:04:16,329
and lied to me.

23
00:04:16,430 --> 00:04:18,390
But Lord Jiuhuo said

24
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:21,000
you're coveting my demonic energy.

25
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:24,690
One of you must be lying.

26
00:04:36,310 --> 00:04:37,120
So it's true—

27
00:04:37,670 --> 00:04:41,190
absorbing Jia Lan's demonic energy can break the spell.

28
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:49,120
It looks quite pretty.

29
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:56,950
I told you

30
00:04:58,070 --> 00:04:59,920
that you would come to save me.

31
00:05:03,130 --> 00:05:04,550
Save me,

32
00:05:06,290 --> 00:05:07,450
and I can...

33
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:10,070
help you deal with...

34
00:05:12,070 --> 00:05:13,410
Jiuhuo.

35
00:05:13,830 --> 00:05:16,800
Did I ever say I wanted to deal with Lord Jiuhuo?

36
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:22,600
Is he truly good to you,

37
00:05:23,830 --> 00:05:25,630
or is he just treating you

38
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:27,910
as Jia Lan's replacement?

39
00:05:29,270 --> 00:05:31,730
Why does the mandala flower on your forehead

40
00:05:31,750 --> 00:05:34,350
look exactly like Jia Lan's?

41
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:38,390
You're just a prisoner,

42
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:41,020
and you dare to sow discord

43
00:05:41,020 --> 00:05:43,840
between me and Lord Jiuhuo?

44
00:05:45,890 --> 00:05:46,950
I know

45
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:49,180
what he wants

46
00:05:50,220 --> 00:05:51,740
isn't just a replacement.

47
00:05:52,860 --> 00:05:53,940
He wants

48
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:56,000
the real Jia Lan.

49
00:05:59,190 --> 00:06:00,900
I am who I am,

50
00:06:01,290 --> 00:06:03,300
not anyone's replacement.

51
00:06:04,690 --> 00:06:05,450
Well...

52
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:08,690
then...

53
00:06:10,770 --> 00:06:12,200
prove it to me.

54
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:25,500
Why is it getting more and more desolate?

55
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:26,820
Could it be...

56
00:06:27,950 --> 00:06:31,750
Could it be that I remembered the route the girl gave me incorrectly?

57
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:36,120
I'm so stupid.

58
00:06:37,550 --> 00:06:38,700
I'm so hungry.

59
00:06:47,030 --> 00:06:48,060
There's hope.

60
00:06:48,090 --> 00:06:49,159
There's hope.

61
00:06:58,740 --> 00:07:00,350
I am who I am,

62
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:02,560
not anyone's replacement.

63
00:07:03,510 --> 00:07:07,000
Then prove it to me.

64
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:14,390
Servants.

00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:17,510
Left Guardian.

66
00:07:18,610 --> 00:07:20,750
Is Lord Jiuhuo in his chamber?

67
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:21,720
Left Guardian,

68
00:07:21,870 --> 00:07:23,530
Lord Jiuhuo has left the city.

69
00:07:25,830 --> 00:07:27,680
I see. You may go.

70
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:29,390
Yes.

71
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:22,520
They used the entire Netherworld Clan to threaten me,

72
00:08:22,520 --> 00:08:24,060
forcing me to comply,

73
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:26,090
to go alone to meet them

74
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:28,640
at the Beast Kingdom's dungeon.

75
00:08:29,950 --> 00:08:31,430
Beast Kingdom?

76
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:53,780
[Strange Tales in Beast Kingdom]

77
00:08:57,390 --> 00:08:59,560
The Black Fox destroyed the world,

78
00:08:59,580 --> 00:09:01,440
drawing a circle as the boundary.

79
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:04,940
Everything I am doing now

80
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:07,140
is to bring Jia Lan back.

81
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:08,930
Jia Lan is still alive?

82
00:09:09,290 --> 00:09:10,220
Of course.

83
00:09:11,010 --> 00:09:12,920
But she's blocked outside the Boundary

84
00:09:12,920 --> 00:09:14,620
and can't come in.

85
00:09:14,920 --> 00:09:18,490
The Black Fox beyond the Boundary is Jia Lan.

86
00:09:21,690 --> 00:09:24,500
The Black Fox feeds on hatred.

87
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:26,820
Its demonic power is immense.

88
00:09:27,880 --> 00:09:29,710
It can control people's minds

89
00:09:29,820 --> 00:09:31,730
and has no physical form.

90
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,160
No physical form?

91
00:09:38,390 --> 00:09:40,060
Beyond the Boundary,

92
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:43,250
alive, yet without a body.

93
00:09:43,590 --> 00:09:44,780
So it's you.

94
00:09:46,020 --> 00:09:48,820
Good. I'm very satisfied.

95
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:53,050
No wonder

96
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:56,120
you said I'm good.

97
00:09:57,390 --> 00:09:59,880
Aren't I the new body

98
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:02,020
that Lord Jiuhuo carefully prepared

99
00:10:02,570 --> 00:10:04,260
for you?

100
00:10:25,050 --> 00:10:27,710
Lord Jiuhuo, such fine wine,

101
00:10:27,740 --> 00:10:29,240
wouldn't it be better to share it with me

102
00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:30,120
rather than

103
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:32,040
enjoying it alone?

104
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:47,750
Lord Jiuhuo, you look quite troubled.

105
00:10:50,380 --> 00:10:51,790
A leech demon

106
00:10:51,790 --> 00:10:53,320
that is very important to me

107
00:10:53,970 --> 00:10:55,030
escaped.

108
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:57,620
But I've already sent Ye Yuan to find her.

109
00:10:58,840 --> 00:10:59,790
My Lord,

110
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,860
once the Golden Dawn is repaired,

111
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:05,050
you will be able to save Jia Lan.

112
00:11:05,790 --> 00:11:07,000
When that time comes,

113
00:11:07,750 --> 00:11:10,030
will I fall out of your favor?

114
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:19,030
It seems I indeed will.

115
00:11:20,130 --> 00:11:21,400
As compensation,

116
00:11:21,910 --> 00:11:24,600
I'll just take this pot of wine.

117
00:11:41,610 --> 00:11:44,180
Slow down, slow down.

118
00:11:45,620 --> 00:11:47,150
You look weary from travel.

119
00:11:47,630 --> 00:11:49,430
You must have come from far away.

120
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,630
Where are you heading?

121
00:11:52,820 --> 00:11:54,420
I'm going to Golden Dawn Inn.

122
00:11:54,790 --> 00:11:56,550
This is Baiyu Village.

123
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:59,400
The Golden Dawn Inn is not far outside the village.

124
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:03,150
Looks like that leech demon girl

125
00:12:03,150 --> 00:12:04,480
really didn't lie to me.

126
00:12:07,210 --> 00:12:08,460
What did you say?

127
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:10,210
You met that leech demon?

128
00:12:12,110 --> 00:12:13,170
Where is she?

129
00:12:13,390 --> 00:12:14,550
Where is she?

130
00:12:15,590 --> 00:12:17,960
Let... let me think.

131
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:19,460
First, she was east...

132
00:12:19,490 --> 00:12:21,510
No, it should be the opposite.

133
00:12:25,510 --> 00:12:28,640
Chief, I can't quite remember.

134
00:12:52,270 --> 00:12:53,240
Does it hurt?

135
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:57,010
Feeling upset?

136
00:13:00,300 --> 00:13:01,660
You met Jiuhuo?

137
00:13:02,460 --> 00:13:03,780
How did it go?

138
00:13:04,490 --> 00:13:06,440
I'm in a very bad mood right now.

139
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,150
Don't provoke me.

140
00:13:10,930 --> 00:13:13,920
Are you laughing at me because I really did

141
00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:16,170
come back to you just as you predicted?

142
00:13:16,170 --> 00:13:17,550
I'm laughing

143
00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:20,690
because I won't die soon.

144
00:13:24,170 --> 00:13:27,600
Forsaking emotions, pursuing hatred; eternal night befalls.

145
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:29,530
This "Eternal Night" refers to...

146
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:31,390
Jia Lan.

147
00:13:33,510 --> 00:13:35,120
The Eternal Night is Jia Lan?

148
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:37,840
Jiuhuo wants to erase everything about you

149
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:39,260
and turn you into the Black Fox.

150
00:13:39,260 --> 00:13:40,790
Can you still laugh now?

151
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:44,440
I can help you.

152
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,120
Sure.

153
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:03,000
This spiritual power has locked your heart meridian.

154
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,780
If you don't listen to me,

155
00:14:04,870 --> 00:14:08,270
I can make you suffer with just a flick of my finger.

156
00:14:08,390 --> 00:14:11,360
You still refuse to believe me.

157
00:14:12,670 --> 00:14:15,630
My enemies are Jiuhuo and the Black Fox.

158
00:14:16,910 --> 00:14:18,480
You're just a human.

159
00:14:19,430 --> 00:14:21,270
What can you possibly change?

[Baiyu Village]

161
00:14:26,570 --> 00:14:28,360
We've found traces of the leech demon?

162
00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:30,000
That young hero said he can't remember clearly.

163
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:33,390
Chief, don't be too sad. Please accept our condolences.

164
00:14:33,390 --> 00:14:34,440
Yes, yes, Chief.

165
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:34,960
Yes.

166
00:14:34,960 --> 00:14:37,150
Stop being sad, Dad. We'll keep searching.

167
00:14:37,150 --> 00:14:39,210
We'll definitely avenge my brother.

168
00:14:41,110 --> 00:14:43,660
Young hero, please don't take offense.

169
00:14:43,980 --> 00:14:45,910
The leech demon killed my brother.

170
00:14:46,570 --> 00:14:47,170
My father

171
00:14:48,060 --> 00:14:49,860
just wants to avenge my brother.

172
00:14:52,020 --> 00:14:55,300
But... she didn't seem like an evil demon at all.

173
00:14:55,660 --> 00:14:56,780
She even...

174
00:14:57,280 --> 00:14:59,440
kindly showed me the way.

175
00:14:59,670 --> 00:15:01,600
Demons are all deceitful by nature.

176
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:03,670
They often use their appearance to deceive people.

177
00:15:03,670 --> 00:15:04,440
Chief!

178
00:15:04,870 --> 00:15:06,320

We've found the whereabouts of that leech demon.

181

Young hero,

182
00:15:11,270 --> 00:15:12,240
that demon is very powerful

183
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:13,200
and has killed so many people.

184
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:14,150
Since you're here,

185
00:15:14,150 --> 00:15:15,610
why don't you come with us?

186
00:15:28,280 --> 00:15:29,860
It should be around here.

187
00:15:31,270 --> 00:15:32,270
Let me take a look.

188
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:47,460
There's some movement deep in the woods.

189
00:15:48,300 --> 00:15:49,650
Alright.

00:15:56,600 --> 00:15:57,390

what's this?

192
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:00,830
It's a wounded cat demon.

193
00:16:00,950 --> 00:16:02,150
It's perfect as bait.

194
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:06,280
Come on, hide, hurry!

195
00:16:08,860 --> 00:16:09,760
Let's hide here.

196
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:11,420
What you're doing is too much.

197
00:16:13,080 --> 00:16:14,150
Too much?

198
00:16:14,270 --> 00:16:15,510
They are demons.

199
00:16:15,590 --> 00:16:18,600
If we don't do this, how are we going to lure the leech demon out?

200
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:19,870
Once we catch the leech demon,

201
00:16:19,870 --> 00:16:21,410
we'll go together to Sky City and claim the reward.

202
00:16:21,410 --> 00:16:22,220
By then,

203
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:24,300
let's split the bounty fifty-fifty.

204
00:16:39,270 --> 00:16:40,360
It really is her.

205
00:16:56,870 --> 00:16:58,380
She's saving that demon.

206
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:10,200
Look.

207
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:18,690
What are you doing?

208
00:17:20,700 --> 00:17:22,560
Watch out for the poisonous mist!

209
00:17:33,420 --> 00:17:35,710
You bitch, what are you waiting for?

210
00:17:35,740 --> 00:17:36,890
Do it!

211
00:17:45,310 --> 00:17:47,690
Mu, ask her for the antidote.

212
00:17:48,070 --> 00:17:48,750
Hurry!

213
00:17:48,920 --> 00:17:49,510
Miss,

214
00:17:50,220 --> 00:17:51,790
if I'm not mistaken,

215
00:17:51,870 --> 00:17:54,110
you just used a paralytic poison,

216
00:17:54,370 --> 00:17:55,830
which isn't fatal, right?

217
00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:05,430
You demon, how dare you trick me!

218
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:09,160
What are you doing?

219
00:18:09,160 --> 00:18:10,830
She... she's a demon!

220
00:18:11,070 --> 00:18:13,160
Whatever we do to her, it won't be too much!

221
00:18:13,160 --> 00:18:15,750
Don't forget, you're here to catch a demon.

222
00:18:17,720 --> 00:18:19,070
I am,

223
00:18:19,880 --> 00:18:22,480
but I can't kill innocents indiscriminately.

224
00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:27,350
We must

225
00:18:28,310 --> 00:18:29,960
get to the truth.

226
00:18:31,540 --> 00:18:33,100
Why did he save me?

227
00:18:37,040 --> 00:18:41,530
[Baiyu Village]

228
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:39,200
Chief!

229
00:18:39,350 --> 00:18:41,680
Chief! We've caught the demon.

230
00:18:41,790 --> 00:18:43,180
We've caught the demon?

231
00:18:49,310 --> 00:18:50,850
We finally caught you.

232
00:18:50,870 --> 00:18:52,000
I'm going to kill you

233
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,380
to avenge my son!

234
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:55,960
Kill her! Kill her! Kill her!

235
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,160
Everyone, please calm down!

236
00:18:57,160 --> 00:18:57,720
Kill her!

237
00:18:57,720 --> 00:18:58,640
Chief,

238
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:00,830
let me ask her about the truth first.

239
00:19:00,830 --> 00:19:02,490
What's there to ask about?

240
00:19:06,740 --> 00:19:07,560
Miss,

241
00:19:07,920 --> 00:19:09,820
why did you kill the chief's son?

242
00:19:09,960 --> 00:19:11,640
Are you asking a demon

243
00:19:11,790 --> 00:19:13,270
why it kills?

244
00:19:13,290 --> 00:19:14,420
A demon is a demon.

245
00:19:14,450 --> 00:19:16,920
My son's death is the best evidence!

246
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:18,360
What more is there to ask?

247
00:19:18,360 --> 00:19:20,040
Yeah, what more is there to ask?

248
00:19:20,040 --> 00:19:21,720
We shouldn't keep her alive.

249
00:19:21,880 --> 00:19:22,820
Kill her!

250
00:19:24,370 --> 00:19:25,570
Kill her!

251
00:19:25,830 --> 00:19:26,790
I'll kill you

252
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:28,780
to avenge my son!

253
00:19:29,100 --> 00:19:30,940
I'll kill you!

254
00:19:32,140 --> 00:19:32,920
What?

255
00:19:48,810 --> 00:19:49,910
Dad, Dad.

256
00:19:50,290 --> 00:19:51,820
We can't let it escalate.

257
00:19:51,860 --> 00:19:53,160
If this guy gets angry

258
00:19:53,160 --> 00:19:54,260
and teams up with this demon,

259
00:19:54,260 --> 00:19:56,050
we'll be in big trouble.

260
00:19:59,140 --> 00:20:02,150
Mu, I know you have a kind heart.

261
00:20:02,750 --> 00:20:04,380
So, let's do as you said

262
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:06,640
and wait for this demon to confess her crimes

263
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:08,360
before we deal with her.

264
00:20:09,820 --> 00:20:11,100
Thank you, Sun.

265
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:12,440
Thank you, Chief.

266
00:20:14,420 --> 00:20:15,830
What a dummy.

267
00:20:15,930 --> 00:20:17,410
You believe everyone.

268
00:20:35,060 --> 00:20:36,070
Miss, when you get angry,

269
00:20:36,070 --> 00:20:37,400
your eyes turn red.

270
00:20:37,880 --> 00:20:38,810
It's quite rare.

271
00:20:47,510 --> 00:20:48,570
What are you doing?

272
00:20:49,290 --> 00:20:50,860
I'm going to untie you.

273
00:20:51,190 --> 00:20:53,110
Because I don't think you're a bad demon.

274
00:20:53,110 --> 00:20:54,590
Such a hypocritical act.

275
00:20:54,590 --> 00:20:55,640
So annoying.

276
00:20:55,960 --> 00:20:57,490
Blue Eyes, you take charge.

277
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:18,040
They've turned blue now.

278
00:21:20,270 --> 00:21:22,070
Miss, are you not angry anymore?

279
00:21:24,660 --> 00:21:26,150
I lied to you.

280
00:21:26,920 --> 00:21:28,790
I deliberately gave you wrong directions.

281
00:21:28,790 --> 00:21:30,960
I didn't expect you to still come here.

282
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:32,510
However,

283
00:21:32,700 --> 00:21:35,070
this Baiyu Village is really not a good place.

284
00:21:35,070 --> 00:21:37,130
You should leave as soon as possible.

285
00:21:39,480 --> 00:21:40,960
Then can you tell me,

286
00:21:42,590 --> 00:21:44,590
did you really kill the chief's son?

287
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:47,590
I...

288
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:50,420
Mu.

289
00:21:51,780 --> 00:21:52,980
I brought you some...

290
00:21:53,790 --> 00:21:55,220
Why was she untied?

291
00:21:55,960 --> 00:21:57,750
Sun, with me here,

292
00:21:57,750 --> 00:21:58,750
she won't escape.

293
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:04,590
Thank you, Mu.

294
00:22:04,790 --> 00:22:06,000
Then have this porridge first

295
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:07,270
before you keep interrogating her.

296
00:22:07,270 --> 00:22:08,400
Thank you, Sun.

297
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:26,310
Miss, have some porridge first.

298
00:22:26,310 --> 00:22:27,970
We'll talk after you're full.

299
00:22:28,270 --> 00:22:29,110
It's for me?

300
00:22:29,270 --> 00:22:30,790
Yes, aren't you hungry?

301
00:22:32,430 --> 00:22:34,570
He can't even tell that it was poisoned.

302
00:22:34,570 --> 00:22:36,050
What a dummy.

303
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:37,580
I'm not hungry.

304
00:22:42,310 --> 00:22:43,640
Well, since you're not hungry,

305
00:22:43,640 --> 00:22:44,640
I'll have it.

306
00:22:44,790 --> 00:22:47,340
I'll bring you some food later.

307
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:51,020
He won't turn back until he hits the wall.

308
00:22:51,020 --> 00:22:53,460
I might as well let him see for himself

309
00:22:53,480 --> 00:22:55,280
the true nature of these people.

310
00:23:08,740 --> 00:23:09,920
What's happening?

311
00:23:10,430 --> 00:23:12,260
I suddenly feel weak all over.

312
00:23:12,750 --> 00:23:13,940
Could it be...

313
00:23:14,790 --> 00:23:16,680
Could it be... food poisoning?

314
00:23:16,700 --> 00:23:18,620
Sir, you've been poisoned.

315
00:23:18,680 --> 00:23:19,900
Poisoned!

316
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:20,960
I'm new here,

317
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:22,160
with no grudges or enmity.

318
00:23:22,160 --> 00:23:23,560
Who would want to harm me?

319
00:23:24,680 --> 00:23:27,200
Never mind. I'll take you away from here first.

320
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:29,020
It's late at night.

321
00:23:29,240 --> 00:23:30,970
Where are you going, handsome?

322
00:23:33,680 --> 00:23:35,330
This little demoness

323
00:23:35,510 --> 00:23:38,510
looks plain. She's really boring.

324
00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:40,440
Handsome,

325
00:23:40,590 --> 00:23:43,200
why don't you consider me instead?

326
00:23:43,790 --> 00:23:45,110
What are you trying to do?

327
00:23:45,110 --> 00:23:45,930
Blue Eyes,

328
00:23:45,950 --> 00:23:47,680
you don't have the guts to do this.

329
00:23:47,680 --> 00:23:48,610
Let me handle it.

330
00:23:50,460 --> 00:23:52,750
How considerate.

331
00:23:53,070 --> 00:23:54,620
Well, in that case,

332
00:23:54,830 --> 00:23:56,570
I'll give you a chance.

333
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:12,330
I helped you heal before,

334
00:24:12,440 --> 00:24:14,300
but you attacked me in return.

335
00:24:14,370 --> 00:24:17,790
Now you dare to say I look plain?

336
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:18,950
Miss.

337
00:24:20,590 --> 00:24:22,250
Let's leave this place first.

338
00:24:25,750 --> 00:24:26,310
Let's go!

339
00:24:39,920 --> 00:24:40,590
Miss!

340
00:24:45,640 --> 00:24:46,620
Dummy!

341
00:24:47,130 --> 00:24:49,510
You escaped my arrow in the forest last time.

342
00:24:49,510 --> 00:24:51,640
This time, neither of you will escape.

343
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:54,830
Chief,

344
00:24:55,430 --> 00:24:56,710
why?

345
00:24:56,920 --> 00:24:59,400
You're sheltering the demon who killed my son.

346
00:24:59,400 --> 00:25:00,460
You deserve to die!

347
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:02,950
None of you will escape today.

348
00:25:03,130 --> 00:25:05,060
The demon-controlling talisman!

349
00:25:05,510 --> 00:25:06,510
What are you waiting for?

350
00:25:06,510 --> 00:25:07,860
Kill them!

351
00:25:08,070 --> 00:25:08,930
Take my poison!

352
00:25:50,940 --> 00:25:51,930
How is it?

353
00:25:53,880 --> 00:25:56,310
My room isn't bad, right?

354
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:00,830
If you hadn't said it,

355
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:03,200
I'd think it was Jia Lan's.

356
00:26:03,310 --> 00:26:06,790
You know the consequences of angering me.

357
00:26:09,920 --> 00:26:11,180
It's quite miserable.

358
00:26:12,270 --> 00:26:13,110
Come here.

359
00:26:26,440 --> 00:26:27,110
Sit.

360
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:47,000
I can do it myself.

361
00:26:48,920 --> 00:26:50,940
If you continue to act like this,

362
00:26:51,030 --> 00:26:53,880
it's hard for me to believe you can help me.

363
00:27:50,160 --> 00:27:53,560
You're willing to sacrifice your life for Dongfang Huaizhu.

364
00:27:55,130 --> 00:27:56,530
This feeling

365
00:27:56,590 --> 00:27:58,620
is just what I need

366
00:27:59,160 --> 00:28:01,490
to use against Lord Jiuhuo.

367
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:40,150
Your breathing

368
00:28:40,840 --> 00:28:42,160
is quite rapid.

369
00:28:52,440 --> 00:28:53,550
What is this?

370
00:28:55,110 --> 00:28:56,960
This is the aphrodisiac incense

371
00:28:57,240 --> 00:28:58,900
I specially prepared for you.

372
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:01,270
For me?

373
00:29:01,880 --> 00:29:02,920
You like it?

374
00:29:08,680 --> 00:29:11,920
Your face is so flushed.

375
00:29:14,420 --> 00:29:16,100
Are you feeling unwell?

376
00:29:20,930 --> 00:29:22,560
Or are you just shy?

377
00:29:33,520 --> 00:29:35,640
Are you feeling better now?

378
00:30:17,710 --> 00:30:18,770
I can't do this.

379
00:30:19,970 --> 00:30:21,590
This isn't what you want.

380
00:30:21,920 --> 00:30:23,330
Then what do I want?

381
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:25,860
You want...

382
00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:29,610
You want...

383
00:30:30,910 --> 00:30:33,590
to know what Jiuhuo will do to you

384
00:30:33,610 --> 00:30:34,450
and...

385
00:30:35,400 --> 00:30:37,270
who would risk their life

386
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:41,000
to help you deal with him.

387
00:30:43,880 --> 00:30:45,350
Are you saying...

388
00:30:46,110 --> 00:30:47,750
that person is you?

389
00:30:48,750 --> 00:30:52,010
I'm the only one who can help you.

390
00:31:00,600 --> 00:31:03,060
Then why don't you continue?

391
00:31:04,070 --> 00:31:04,930
Because...

392
00:31:06,160 --> 00:31:07,950
Because you're toying with me.

393
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:15,600
If you can hold back

394
00:31:16,590 --> 00:31:18,240
until the incense burns out,

395
00:31:20,820 --> 00:31:22,220
I'll believe

396
00:31:22,750 --> 00:31:24,550
you're useful.

397
00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:28,880
However,

398
00:31:29,770 --> 00:31:31,490
it won't be easy.

399
00:31:32,550 --> 00:31:34,310
After all,

400
00:31:34,890 --> 00:31:37,130
I personally made this incense.

401
00:32:48,030 --> 00:32:48,750
Sir!

402
00:32:49,920 --> 00:32:52,600
Sir, where are you going?

403
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:53,770
I'm going to Baiyu Village.

404
00:32:53,770 --> 00:32:56,160
There are some things I haven't figured out yet.

405
00:32:56,160 --> 00:32:58,400
Bai... Baiyu Village?

406
00:32:59,880 --> 00:33:02,010
I know you're afraid of Baiyu Village.

407
00:33:02,440 --> 00:33:03,590
But please don't worry.

408
00:33:03,590 --> 00:33:05,190
I'm just going to take a look.

409
00:33:07,240 --> 00:33:09,300
And thank you for treating my wounds.

410
00:33:09,450 --> 00:33:10,270
Take care.

411
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:29,100
This dummy really doesn't know what's good for him.

412
00:33:49,860 --> 00:33:52,030
Ye Yuan is going out of the city?

413
00:33:52,670 --> 00:33:54,310
We must not alert him.
