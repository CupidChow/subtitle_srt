Dongfang Huaizhu,

241
00:21:07,110 --> 00:21:10,130
you betrayed the Nangong family

242
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:12,500
and sided with Wangquan Hongye instead.

243
00:21:12,550 --> 00:21:15,150
But it doesn't mean you can always get your way.

244
00:21:21,590 --> 00:21:22,920
I'm right here now.

245
00:21:23,720 --> 00:21:25,510
Do you dare to have

246
00:21:25,830 --> 00:21:27,360
a one-on-one fight with me?

247
00:21:27,550 --> 00:21:29,720
Why would I do that?

248
00:21:29,880 --> 00:21:32,550
I purged Yiqi Alliance of those close to demons.

249
00:21:32,550 --> 00:21:33,990
Did I do anything wrong?

250
00:21:34,160 --> 00:21:35,690
You made demons kill humans

251
00:21:35,750 --> 00:21:37,960
under the influence of demon-controlling talismans.

252
00:21:37,960 --> 00:21:40,000
Wangquan Hongye and I are both witnesses.

253
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,340
That's a false accusation!

254
00:21:42,510 --> 00:21:44,750
The crime was committed by Director Li.

255
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:46,920
Who knows if the Wangquan family

256
00:21:46,920 --> 00:21:49,070
has instructed him to

257
00:21:49,920 --> 00:21:51,790
frame me?

258
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:55,210

The first rule of the Inspection Bureau

276

is that the arrested

277

Power must not be abused.

381
00:29:53,030 --> 00:29:55,030
Integrity must not be compromised.

382
00:29:56,510 --> 00:29:59,170
To end the conflicts between demons and humans,

383
00:29:59,270 --> 00:30:01,070
the first thing to do is to change

384
00:30:01,240 --> 00:30:02,700
the entire Yiqi Alliance.

385
00:30:04,270 --> 00:30:06,000
Purging the Inspection Bureau

386
00:30:07,830 --> 00:30:09,510
is a necessary move.

387
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:11,750
Yitan,

388
00:30:13,030 --> 00:30:14,110
I've done

389
00:30:16,200 --> 00:30:17,590
the right thing.

390
00:30:20,200 --> 00:30:21,160
But why

391
00:30:24,920 --> 00:30:26,510
am I so upset?

392
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:34,960
You've done your best.

393
00:30:36,260 --> 00:30:37,420
I am the one to blame

394
00:30:38,160 --> 00:30:40,420
for dropping the ball on the Yang family.

395
00:30:42,350 --> 00:30:43,760
In this world,

396
00:30:47,590 --> 00:30:49,650
how many souls could be like Mu Xiaowu

397
00:30:51,680 --> 00:30:52,790
and Chu Jing?

398
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:13,960
Why do righteous

399
00:31:15,400 --> 00:31:17,860
and honorable humans and demons have to die,

400
00:31:21,160 --> 00:31:23,750
while filthy noble families get to live?

401
00:31:27,860 --> 00:31:29,590
We are already

402
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:35,720
in the darkest and the most chaotic times.

403
00:31:41,400 --> 00:31:42,270
Will we be able

404
00:31:46,960 --> 00:31:48,640
to eradicate evil?

405
00:31:51,790 --> 00:31:53,160
Is it worth these

406
00:31:56,110 --> 00:31:57,590
many sacrifices?

407
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:30,400
You're back.

408
00:32:33,350 --> 00:32:34,750
You haven't

409
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:36,550
eaten anything, right?

410
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:38,550
I've made some noodles.

411
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:41,410
Let's go.

412
00:32:53,890 --> 00:32:54,890
I'm not hungry.

413
00:32:58,160 --> 00:32:59,710
I know what happened

414
00:33:00,530 --> 00:33:01,590
to the Yang family.

415
00:33:03,530 --> 00:33:06,370
Resentful and upset though you are,

416
00:33:07,750 --> 00:33:08,920
your life

417
00:33:09,510 --> 00:33:12,030
has to go on.

418
00:33:15,960 --> 00:33:17,550
There's a thing I need to do.

419
00:33:19,070 --> 00:33:20,130
I have to go out now.

420
00:33:21,590 --> 00:33:22,070
Huaizhu...

421
00:33:22,070 --> 00:33:22,720
Qinlan,

422
00:33:23,390 --> 00:33:24,570
leave her alone.

423
00:33:31,640 --> 00:33:34,720
Every big deal in the past

424
00:33:35,960 --> 00:33:38,440
will seem trivial in retrospect.

425
00:33:39,160 --> 00:33:40,000
It's all fine.

426
00:33:40,310 --> 00:33:41,200
She'll move on.

427
00:33:45,070 --> 00:33:46,240
Come on.

428
00:33:47,270 --> 00:33:48,680
Eat it while it's hot.

429
00:34:03,350 --> 00:34:04,880
The veil dress...

430
00:34:07,310 --> 00:34:08,909
Ruyi Pavilion is closed now.

431
00:34:09,070 --> 00:34:10,400
Please come back tomorrow.

432
00:34:10,400 --> 00:34:11,929
I'm not here to buy jewelry.

433
00:34:17,030 --> 00:34:18,030
You may leave now.

434
00:34:23,800 --> 00:34:25,550
Miss Qingmu, I'd like to buy

435
00:34:25,570 --> 00:34:27,100
some information from you.

436
00:34:29,070 --> 00:34:30,920
Yang Yan cut off her hair today

437
00:34:31,320 --> 00:34:33,250
to sever ties with the Yang family.

438
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:35,110
Miss Huaizhu,

439
00:34:35,230 --> 00:34:37,110
are you going to inquire about her?

440
00:34:37,110 --> 00:34:38,000
Yes.

441
00:34:38,670 --> 00:34:39,590
I'd like to know

442
00:34:39,960 --> 00:34:41,159
where Yang Yan is now.

443
00:34:41,320 --> 00:34:42,800
Name a price, please.

444
00:34:43,630 --> 00:34:45,429
You're a caring person.

445
00:34:45,590 --> 00:34:47,960
I won't charge you a penny this time.

446
00:34:48,610 --> 00:34:49,630
I will give you

447
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:51,280
a satisfactory answer

448
00:34:51,280 --> 00:34:52,510
in seven days.

449
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:54,630
Got it.

450
00:34:56,070 --> 00:34:56,670
Thank you.

451
00:35:03,110 --> 00:35:04,070
I don't know

452
00:35:04,550 --> 00:35:05,760
if you

453
00:35:06,070 --> 00:35:08,130
and Young Master Wangquan are close.

454
00:35:09,070 --> 00:35:10,590
I just hope you'll keep

455
00:35:10,920 --> 00:35:12,280
this matter secret.

456
00:35:13,720 --> 00:35:15,100
No one else will know about it.

457
00:35:15,100 --> 00:35:16,270
You have my word.

458
00:35:16,680 --> 00:35:17,880
This matter will not

459
00:35:18,110 --> 00:35:20,170
reach Young Master Wangquan's ears.

460
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:31,190
Yesterday's Yiqi Alliance convention decided

461
00:35:31,190 --> 00:35:34,000
that the noble families would take turns
to manage the Inspection Bureau.

462
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:35,760
Master Zhang Zheng abstained,

463
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:36,880
but all the other families

464
00:35:36,880 --> 00:35:38,800
agreed to the new protocol.

465
00:35:40,840 --> 00:35:42,970
Is Nangong Chui in Huntian Prison now?

466
00:35:43,550 --> 00:35:45,630
He was put behind bars
after yesterday's convention.

467
00:35:45,630 --> 00:35:47,550
Given the solid proof of him instructing Director Li

468
00:35:47,550 --> 00:35:48,550
to manipulate demons to kill humans,

469
00:35:48,550 --> 00:35:49,610
he cannot get away.

470
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:53,030
He slaughtered the families of those imprisoned bad demons.

471
00:35:53,030 --> 00:35:54,150
It is time

472
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:56,000
for their feuds to be ended.

473
00:35:56,360 --> 00:35:57,510
Got it.

474
00:36:07,280 --> 00:36:07,760
You...

475
00:36:07,780 --> 00:36:08,510
Get in there!

476
00:36:13,510 --> 00:36:14,150
You...

477
00:36:14,190 --> 00:36:15,520
What do you want from me?

478
00:36:16,190 --> 00:36:17,670
Wangquan Hongye!

479
00:36:17,840 --> 00:36:18,840
Wangquan Hongye!

480
00:36:33,840 --> 00:36:37,190
Isn't this Mr. Nangong Chui, the famous demon slayer?

481
00:36:41,400 --> 00:36:42,550
You're right.

482
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:43,960
It's him.

483
00:36:44,590 --> 00:36:46,360
It was he who took

484
00:36:46,550 --> 00:36:48,850
my daughter's demon core

485
00:36:49,230 --> 00:36:51,710
and offered it to Nangong Ye.

486
00:36:59,030 --> 00:37:00,360
What are you going to do?

487
00:37:09,880 --> 00:37:11,250
Who are you?

488
00:37:11,360 --> 00:37:12,690
What are you going to do?

489
00:37:13,360 --> 00:37:14,360
I'm telling you,

490
00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:17,110
they've put me in the wrong place.

491
00:37:17,110 --> 00:37:19,110
I-I-I shouldn't be here.

492
00:37:19,690 --> 00:37:20,880
Get away from me.

493
00:37:21,150 --> 00:37:22,790
Obnoxious demons,

494
00:37:23,230 --> 00:37:24,230
stay away from me!

495
00:37:28,670 --> 00:37:29,670
Stay away from me.

496
00:37:33,150 --> 00:37:34,400
You... You demons...

497
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:35,800
You...
