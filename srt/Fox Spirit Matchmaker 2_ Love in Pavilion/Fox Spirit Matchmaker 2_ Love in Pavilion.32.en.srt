00:21:28,790 --> 00:21:29,770
It's still not as perfect

192
00:21:29,770 --> 00:21:31,820
as the purple-gold gourd you made.

193
00:21:32,150 --> 00:21:33,240
Your magical artifacts

194
00:21:33,240 --> 00:21:34,700
are unparalleled!

195
00:21:35,980 --> 00:21:39,040
Li Zizai's magical artifacts are the best in the world,

196
00:21:39,040 --> 00:21:41,120
yet he suddenly chose talismans.

197
00:21:41,250 --> 00:21:43,460
Was it really because he liked them?

198
00:21:44,910 --> 00:21:46,230
Li Quzhuo,

199
00:21:46,310 --> 00:21:48,200
you secretly joined the Mask Group,

200
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:50,050
claiming to have a chivalrous heart.

201
00:21:50,050 --> 00:21:52,560
But do you really have the ability to save others?

202
00:21:52,560 --> 00:21:55,270
You were almost killed by the Rakshasa bird demons.

203
00:21:55,270 --> 00:21:56,910
Have you forgotten?

204
00:21:57,680 --> 00:21:59,510
Servant, is the medicine here?

205
00:21:59,550 --> 00:22:00,200
Coming!

206
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:00,860
Move aside.

207
00:22:01,310 --> 00:22:02,070
Move aside!

208
00:22:07,880 --> 00:22:08,590
Quzhuo.

209
00:22:10,070 --> 00:22:10,680
Quzhuo.

210
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:12,920
Zizai...

211
00:22:12,920 --> 00:22:13,980
Where are you hurt?

212
00:22:14,510 --> 00:22:15,510
Zizai...

213
00:22:16,550 --> 00:22:17,030
I...

214
00:22:17,640 --> 00:22:19,220
Today, alone...

215
00:22:19,790 --> 00:22:20,550
I...

216
00:22:21,590 --> 00:22:24,550
fought against the entire Rakshasa bird demon clan.

217
00:22:31,350 --> 00:22:33,280
The Rakshasa bird demon poison...

218
00:22:35,090 --> 00:22:37,740
Li Quzhuo, do you know

219
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:39,720
who ultimately cleaned up after

220
00:22:39,790 --> 00:22:41,640
your so-called heroic acts?

221
00:22:42,940 --> 00:22:46,080
Do you know what price he paid for this?

222
00:22:47,450 --> 00:22:48,690
What price?

223
00:23:04,680 --> 00:23:06,210
Hand over the antidote,

224
00:23:06,670 --> 00:23:09,070
or I'll raze your Snow Ravine to the ground.

225
00:23:12,070 --> 00:23:15,110
Kill me, and your brother must die.

226
00:23:16,030 --> 00:23:17,290
You should have a taste

227
00:23:17,350 --> 00:23:19,530
of losing a loved one too.

228
00:23:19,590 --> 00:23:21,590
What will it take for you to save him?

229
00:23:21,680 --> 00:23:23,400
If you want to save your brother,

230
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:26,730
you'll have to trade it with your most precious possession.

231
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:28,680
Eldest Son of the Li family,

232
00:23:28,680 --> 00:23:30,880
your magical artifacts are unrivaled.

233
00:23:31,350 --> 00:23:33,280
Your most precious possession

234
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:35,720
should be your hands, am I right?

235
00:23:40,520 --> 00:23:42,440
Your brother exchanged his right hand

236
00:23:42,440 --> 00:23:43,880
for your life.

237
00:23:44,850 --> 00:23:47,850
What he loved most in his life were magical artifacts.

238
00:23:48,750 --> 00:23:50,680
He gave up his lifelong pursuit.

239
00:23:51,500 --> 00:23:53,400
How agonizing must that be?

240
00:24:03,770 --> 00:24:05,240
Li Quzhuo,

241
00:24:05,650 --> 00:24:07,530
you really deserve to die.

242
00:24:14,340 --> 00:24:15,910
Li Quzhuo,

243
00:24:16,310 --> 00:24:18,340
you only drag others down.

244
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:20,680
Who needs a loser

245
00:24:20,680 --> 00:24:22,530

246
00:24:23,640 --> 00:24:25,240
Who needs a loser

247
00:24:28,540 --> 00:24:30,110
like me?

248
00:24:31,570 --> 00:24:32,890
Li Quzhuo,

249
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:37,080
your brother lost his right hand because of you.

250
00:24:37,630 --> 00:24:41,220
Don't you think you should give him something in return?

251
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:48,510
Yes.

252
00:24:56,790 --> 00:24:58,380
What I owe my brother...

253
00:25:03,310 --> 00:25:04,400
I'll repay it.

254
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:26,240

Li Zizai.

260
00:25:47,660 --> 00:25:50,520
You've always wanted to protect your brother.

261
00:25:50,730 --> 00:25:52,680
I'll let you witness him die

262
00:25:52,680 --> 00:25:54,510

00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:08,050

I promise I'll get you out of here.

271
00:26:29,920 --> 00:26:31,920
Do you still think you have a way out?

272
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:33,680
Can you take

273
00:26:33,680 --> 00:26:35,920

00:31:34,050 --> 00:31:37,600
We just sacrificed some magical artifacts and talismans.

378
00:31:38,270 --> 00:31:39,880
Our family's wealthy and prosperous.

379
00:31:39,880 --> 00:31:40,810
We can afford it.

380
00:31:42,020 --> 00:31:43,460
Besides, who am I?

381
00:31:43,680 --> 00:31:45,420
A petty demon

382
00:31:45,640 --> 00:31:46,970
can't do anything to me.

383
00:31:49,790 --> 00:31:50,810
Really?

384
00:31:53,670 --> 00:31:55,110
If I make the vow,

385
00:31:55,110 --> 00:31:57,110
will you join the Mask Group with me?

386
00:31:59,610 --> 00:32:01,590
I, Li Quzhuo, swear

387
00:32:01,880 --> 00:32:04,030
I'll keep this life-saving talisman

388
00:32:04,030 --> 00:32:06,440
with me at all times, never letting it leave my side.

389
00:32:06,440 --> 00:32:08,510
How's that? Am I clever or what?

390
00:32:08,510 --> 00:32:10,000
Life-saving talisman!

391
00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:12,940
I guessed it right!

392
00:32:18,770 --> 00:32:20,770
This isn't a life-saving talisman.

393
00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:26,570
It's a life-exchanging talisman.

394
00:32:29,340 --> 00:32:30,600
Silly little brother,

395
00:32:31,560 --> 00:32:33,710
go ahead and protect this world.

396
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:35,550
Descend.

397
00:32:36,250 --> 00:32:37,820
I'll protect you.

398
00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:43,270
Zizai...

399
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:48,160
Zizai!

400
00:33:33,780 --> 00:33:35,250
Black Grief Tree?

401
00:33:38,060 --> 00:33:39,750
Yitan, Zui,

402
00:33:40,060 --> 00:33:40,740
it's me!

403
00:33:41,270 --> 00:33:41,920
Qiyue!

404
00:33:48,360 --> 00:33:49,820
My brother's paper crane.

405
00:33:49,960 --> 00:33:51,560
Let's hear what he has to say.

406
00:33:54,550 --> 00:33:55,440
Yitan!

407
00:34:05,670 --> 00:34:06,750
Stop, Yitan!

408
00:34:06,750 --> 00:34:08,010
What's wrong with you?

409
00:34:48,110 --> 00:34:49,800
You promised to go bird egg hunting with me,

410
00:34:49,800 --> 00:34:50,860
but you stood me up.

411
00:34:51,110 --> 00:34:52,150
Is composing couplets

412
00:34:52,150 --> 00:34:53,610
with the teacher that fun?

413
00:34:53,840 --> 00:34:56,070
Taking bird eggs is wrong.

414
00:34:56,190 --> 00:34:58,520
A gentleman should be upright and proper.

415
00:34:58,590 --> 00:35:00,990
We shouldn't steal eggs from mother birds.

416
00:35:01,070 --> 00:35:01,960
Besides,

417
00:35:02,110 --> 00:35:04,920
Cousin doesn't care that much about his face.

418
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:05,630
You...

419
00:35:06,440 --> 00:35:08,880
Look at him! Who did he learn all this from?

420
00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:11,440
Ignore what your mother said.

421
00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:12,760
Go on, go play.

422
00:35:13,150 --> 00:35:14,280
Thank you, Daddy.

423
00:35:16,440 --> 00:35:17,640
Why'd you take a book?

424
00:35:27,840 --> 00:35:28,510
Is it sweet?

425
00:35:28,510 --> 00:35:29,030
Yes.

426
00:35:29,990 --> 00:35:31,000
So from now on,

427
00:35:31,070 --> 00:35:33,280
will you still argue with me?

428
00:35:34,150 --> 00:35:35,030
Of course not.

429
00:35:39,430 --> 00:35:40,350
Oh, right.

430
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:42,230
Where's my little nephew?

431
00:35:42,230 --> 00:35:44,440
Why haven't I seen him today?

432
00:35:45,710 --> 00:35:46,680
Who knows?

433
00:35:47,190 --> 00:35:49,320
He's probably off playing somewhere.

434
00:35:50,480 --> 00:35:52,340
What about my father and brother?

435
00:35:54,690 --> 00:35:55,920
At this hour...

436
00:35:56,360 --> 00:35:59,160
Practicing swordsmanship in the back mountains?

437
00:36:02,710 --> 00:36:03,230
Here.

438
00:36:08,840 --> 00:36:10,570
These grapes are really sweet.

439
00:36:12,230 --> 00:36:13,150
I hope

440
00:36:13,800 --> 00:36:15,440
this dream never ends.

441
00:36:24,510 --> 00:36:25,510
Weird.

442
00:36:26,670 --> 00:36:30,030
Why did I say this is a dream?

443
00:36:33,510 --> 00:36:34,150
Wait.

444
00:36:36,150 --> 00:36:37,840
My father is already gone.

445
00:36:51,320 --> 00:36:52,000
Zui.

446
00:36:53,520 --> 00:36:54,630
This is not a dream.

447
00:36:56,360 --> 00:36:57,590
This is our future.

448
00:37:02,840 --> 00:37:03,710
Yes,

449
00:37:05,150 --> 00:37:06,510
this is our future.

450
00:37:09,280 --> 00:37:11,210
The future I've always dreamed of.

451
00:37:21,230 --> 00:37:23,230
Even if the whole world betrays you,

452
00:37:25,480 --> 00:37:26,730
I, Yang Yitan, won't.

453
00:37:37,610 --> 00:37:40,590
Wangquan Zui, wake up.

454
00:37:40,960 --> 00:37:42,660
This is all an illusion.

455
00:38:34,170 --> 00:38:36,040
Yang Yitan.

456
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:44,230
When did you fall

457
00:38:45,250 --> 00:38:46,910
under the Black Fox's spell?

458
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:48,590
When I killed Yang Huanzhou

459
00:38:50,020 --> 00:38:51,530
to save you.

460
00:39:08,350 --> 00:39:10,230
Because of my immense hatred,

461
00:39:10,430 --> 00:39:11,920
the Black Fox's power

462
00:39:12,290 --> 00:39:13,930
entered my Clairvoyant Eye.

463
00:39:14,880 --> 00:39:16,320
So...

464
00:39:17,630 --> 00:39:19,110
you became like this

465
00:39:20,240 --> 00:39:21,480
because of me?

466
00:39:21,510 --> 00:39:22,190
Yes!

467
00:39:23,340 --> 00:39:25,020
Justice and righteousness?

468
00:39:26,180 --> 00:39:28,010
They're all fake.

469
00:39:29,560 --> 00:39:32,150
Only the strong decide the fate of the weak.

470
00:39:32,970 --> 00:39:35,330
That's the truth of this world.

471
00:39:36,230 --> 00:39:38,230
Why should we sacrifice ourselves?

472
00:39:39,570 --> 00:39:41,340
Why should we go against fate?

473
00:39:44,130 --> 00:39:45,130
Let go of me!

474
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:46,930
Instead,

475
00:39:49,260 --> 00:39:51,490
let's conquer this world.

476
00:39:52,110 --> 00:39:54,510
Who cares about right or wrong, good or evil?

477
00:39:54,510 --> 00:39:56,340
Let's do whatever we want

478
00:39:57,340 --> 00:39:58,390
and get...

479
00:40:00,810 --> 00:40:02,580
whoever we want.

480
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:10,450
Who are you, really?

481
00:40:16,230 --> 00:40:17,590
Have you forgotten

482
00:40:18,760 --> 00:40:21,250
why he activated his Clairvoyance in the first place?

483
00:40:21,250 --> 00:40:23,320
It was because you were in danger.

484
00:40:25,490 --> 00:40:28,130
Why did he kill his own grandfather?

485
00:40:28,380 --> 00:40:29,840
It was also because of you.

486
00:40:30,820 --> 00:40:32,360
From beginning to end,

487
00:40:32,870 --> 00:40:35,150
it's all because he chose you.

488
00:40:36,120 --> 00:40:37,430
Wangquan Zui,

489
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:40,710
you're flawless and pure.

490
00:40:41,800 --> 00:40:43,170
But think about it,

491
00:40:43,200 --> 00:40:45,860
who has been protecting you so you stay that way?

492
00:40:47,250 --> 00:40:48,520
Do you regret it?

493
00:40:48,990 --> 00:40:50,350
Do you blame yourself?

494
00:40:51,710 --> 00:40:56,020
How many people in this world love you as he does?

495
00:40:56,230 --> 00:40:58,780
He can't turn back now.

496
00:40:59,510 --> 00:41:02,800
Why don't you join him?

497
00:41:12,300 --> 00:41:13,300
Qiyue!

498
00:41:28,880 --> 00:41:30,030
Qiyue!

499
00:41:36,360 --> 00:41:39,510
Yitan, I need to save Qiyue!

500
00:41:45,800 --> 00:41:47,150
Daddy.

501
00:41:54,180 --> 00:41:55,700
Qiyue!

502
00:42:01,510 --> 00:42:02,770
Deng Qiyue,

503
00:42:04,210 --> 00:42:05,640
your daughter

504
00:42:05,920 --> 00:42:09,230
will never see you return as a hero.

505
00:42:47,360 --> 00:42:48,230
Qiyue!

506
00:42:48,230 --> 00:42:49,110
No!
