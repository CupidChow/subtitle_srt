Father.

4
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:08,520
You've finally found me.

5
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:11,710
Father.

6
00:02:12,410 --> 00:02:13,880
Are you really beyond the Boundary?

7
00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:15,080
Tell me where you are.

8
00:02:15,090 --> 00:02:16,150
I'll come save you.

9
00:02:16,300 --> 00:02:17,680
All this time,

10
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:20,579
I've been communicating with you

11
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:23,570
through dreams, using my consciousness.

12
00:02:23,910 --> 00:02:24,520
Father.

13
00:02:24,540 --> 00:02:25,990
Let me tell you

14
00:02:26,430 --> 00:02:28,680
why I came here first.

15
00:02:32,110 --> 00:02:33,510
When you turned sixteen,

16
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:35,030
your uncle Yang He,

17
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:36,750
Yitan's father,

18
00:02:37,020 --> 00:02:38,950
saw something terrifying.

19
00:02:40,079 --> 00:02:41,040
He said

20
00:02:41,310 --> 00:02:43,150
through some unknown means,

21
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:45,510
the Black Grief Tree beyond the Boundary

22
00:02:45,510 --> 00:02:47,840
had connected with the Tushan Grief Tree.

23
00:02:48,870 --> 00:02:50,750
Through the Tushan Grief Tree,

24
00:02:50,870 --> 00:02:55,000
the Black Fox was frantically absorbing hatred from within the Boundary.

25
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:57,590
Yang He used all his spiritual energy

26
00:02:57,610 --> 00:02:59,079
to forcefully activate his Clairvoyance

27
00:02:59,079 --> 00:03:01,650
and saw the weak point in this connection

28
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:03,230
beyond the Boundary.

29
00:03:03,750 --> 00:03:06,480
So I came here with the Wangquan Sword.

30
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:08,800
Who's that? Speak!

31
00:04:10,910 --> 00:04:14,030
After severing the connection between the two Grief Trees,

32
00:04:14,030 --> 00:04:16,360
the Black Fox discovered my whereabouts.

33
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:20,110
I realized I was no match for her.

34
00:04:20,390 --> 00:04:22,360
I could only hide in the shadows,

35
00:04:22,430 --> 00:04:24,240
concealing myself

36
00:04:24,580 --> 00:04:28,380
and communicating with you through dreams using my consciousness.

37
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:31,250
But my willpower is limited,

38
00:04:31,630 --> 00:04:32,720
so I can only

39
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:34,720
speak to you briefly each time.

40
00:04:38,890 --> 00:04:40,130
Yang He said

41
00:04:41,270 --> 00:04:42,730
during the solar eclipse,

42
00:04:43,790 --> 00:04:45,970
the Black Grief Tree's hatred peaks,

43
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:47,900
so it's most likely

44
00:04:48,390 --> 00:04:51,250
to connect with the Grief Tree within the Boundary.

45
00:04:52,280 --> 00:04:53,960
There's one coming soon.

46
00:04:55,220 --> 00:04:56,420
You must be vigilant.

47
00:04:57,310 --> 00:04:59,000
You cannot let her succeed.

48
00:04:59,810 --> 00:05:00,610

The Black Fox is terrifying powerful.

50
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:04,130
She can control others.

51
00:05:04,270 --> 00:05:06,070

00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:03,330
That's more like it.

191
00:11:04,390 --> 00:11:05,990
You're here, Miss Wangquan.

192
00:11:08,030 --> 00:11:08,960
Hello, Grandpa.

193
00:11:09,510 --> 00:11:11,420
We've just made some date cakes.

194
00:11:11,550 --> 00:11:12,600
Want to try some?

195
00:11:12,870 --> 00:11:14,510
Sure, I'll go try it.

196
00:11:14,610 --> 00:11:17,700
I'll leave you two to have a good chat.

197
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:39,820
Why do you suddenly want to

198
00:11:40,550 --> 00:11:41,870
go see your parents?

199
00:11:50,030 --> 00:11:51,000
Yitan.

200
00:11:53,240 --> 00:11:56,120
I've made many mistakes in the past.

201
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:02,870
Anyway, the Yang family is in your hands now.

202
00:12:04,910 --> 00:12:06,320
I have no more regrets.

203
00:12:09,150 --> 00:12:09,910
Grandpa.

204
00:12:11,910 --> 00:12:13,970
I know the cause of my father's death.

205
00:12:21,820 --> 00:12:23,140
That's what happened.

206
00:12:24,910 --> 00:12:25,600
Grandpa.

207
00:12:27,270 --> 00:12:29,000
My father and Uncle Shouzhuo

208
00:12:29,790 --> 00:12:32,190
protected both the human and demon worlds.

209
00:12:32,680 --> 00:12:33,940
If it weren't for them,

210
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:38,000
the Eternal Night might've already descended.

211
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,270
Wangquan Shouzhuo discovered

212
00:12:41,270 --> 00:12:44,330
the rapid increase of resentment beyond the Boundary.

213
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:47,870
So he asked He to activate his Clairvoyance.

214
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:49,150
Yes.

215
00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:51,360
On what grounds?

216
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:54,840
Wangquan Shouzhuo is the leader of Yiqi Alliance.

217
00:12:55,270 --> 00:12:57,070
In his pursuit of fame and glory,

218
00:12:57,510 --> 00:12:59,600
what right does he have to take away my He?

219
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:00,270
Grandpa.

220
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:01,030
What?

221
00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:03,510
Am I wrong?

222
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:04,660
In this world,

223
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:07,720
who'd risk their life just for fame and glory?

224
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:09,510
Because within the Yiqi Alliance,

225
00:13:09,510 --> 00:13:12,370
his Wangquan family has immense wealth and status.

226
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:18,120
Of course he can risk his life to protect it.

227
00:13:18,750 --> 00:13:20,680
But what does our Yang family have?

228
00:13:20,910 --> 00:13:22,150
We have nothing!

229
00:13:22,390 --> 00:13:23,390
Life isn't just

230
00:13:24,790 --> 00:13:26,200
about fame and fortune.

231
00:13:27,950 --> 00:13:29,000
Without money

232
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:29,910
and power,

233
00:13:30,630 --> 00:13:33,040
humans are worse off than livestock.

234
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:36,600
You'll see all the ugliness in this world.

235
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:40,230
Is Wangquan Hongye still

236
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:43,200
planning to investigate the Black Fox matter?

237
00:13:43,670 --> 00:13:45,630
Don't risk your life with him.

238
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:48,960
You're the last hope of our Yang family.

239
00:14:00,370 --> 00:14:01,390
I can't ignore it.

240
00:14:03,370 --> 00:14:03,960
Grandpa,

241
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:06,550
you should rest early.

242
00:14:06,550 --> 00:14:07,270
Yitan!

243
00:14:09,030 --> 00:14:10,550
I've sworn on behalf of our family

244
00:14:10,550 --> 00:14:13,200
to stand with the Wangquans through thick and thin.

245
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:14,030
I'm in charge

246
00:14:14,960 --> 00:14:15,960
of our family now.

247
00:14:16,870 --> 00:14:17,550
Grandpa,

248
00:14:19,150 --> 00:14:20,810
just enjoy your golden years.

249
00:14:46,040 --> 00:14:50,130
[Tomb of beloved son Yang He and virtuous daughter-in-law Ye Yuwei]

250
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:55,630
I heard you arguing with Grandpa.

251
00:15:00,110 --> 00:15:01,310
I thought

252
00:15:02,090 --> 00:15:03,620
he'd understand my father.

253
00:15:04,870 --> 00:15:06,030
Now I realize

254
00:15:07,390 --> 00:15:09,600
my father knew my grandpa too well.

255
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,660
That's why he kept it a secret.

256
00:15:17,830 --> 00:15:18,960
The Yang family...

257
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:22,350
is really a mess.

258
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:28,150
Uncle Yang He,

259
00:15:28,490 --> 00:15:29,480
Aunt Yang Yan,

260
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:30,720
and you

261
00:15:31,380 --> 00:15:33,110
are all brilliant like pearls.

262
00:15:33,520 --> 00:15:34,430
How's that

263
00:15:35,150 --> 00:15:36,120
a mess?

264
00:15:38,360 --> 00:15:39,150
I'm fine.

265
00:15:40,150 --> 00:15:41,750
You don't have to cheer me up.

266
00:15:49,670 --> 00:15:50,600
Father-in-law,

267
00:15:50,630 --> 00:15:51,560
Mother-in-law,

268
00:15:51,740 --> 00:15:53,140
let me introduce myself.

269
00:15:53,790 --> 00:15:54,440
I am

270
00:15:54,910 --> 00:15:56,030
Wangquan Zui.

271
00:15:56,930 --> 00:15:58,380
From now on, Yitan will be

272
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:00,120
under my care.

273
00:16:00,530 --> 00:16:01,510
Rest assured.

274
00:16:02,120 --> 00:16:03,380
I have a fierce temper.

275
00:16:03,390 --> 00:16:06,670
I'll deal with anyone or anything

276
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:08,390
that upsets Yitan.

277
00:16:35,790 --> 00:16:36,550
Master,

278
00:16:36,680 --> 00:16:37,630
here you are.

279
00:16:37,880 --> 00:16:40,240
These are the jewelry sent from Ruyi Pavilion.

280
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:41,600
Please choose a few pieces

281
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:43,200
for use at the grand wedding.

282
00:16:49,210 --> 00:16:51,290
Don't call me Master anymore.

283
00:16:53,390 --> 00:16:55,120
Put the things down and leave.

284
00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:30,390
Long time no see.

285
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:33,730
You think your family will rise to prominence

286
00:17:34,070 --> 00:17:37,000
by Yang Yitan marrying Wangquan Zui.

287
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:40,290
You sure are foolish, Yang Huanzhou.

288
00:17:42,790 --> 00:17:45,000
Yang He died because of the Wangquans.

289
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:46,960
Yang Ying is gone for good.

290
00:17:47,610 --> 00:17:51,400
Yang Yitan will also soon embark on this path of no return.

291
00:17:53,680 --> 00:17:55,390
Our Clairvoyant Yangs

292
00:17:56,680 --> 00:17:59,280
are just sacrificial pawns for the Wangquans!

293
00:18:00,750 --> 00:18:02,400
Now you get it.

294
00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:04,700
By marrying Wangquan Zui,

295
00:18:05,350 --> 00:18:06,510
the Yangs will

296
00:18:07,160 --> 00:18:09,830
completely become a vassal of the Wangquans,

297
00:18:10,680 --> 00:18:14,270
until they've squeezed you dry.

298
00:18:27,830 --> 00:18:30,020
[Tushan]

299
00:18:33,790 --> 00:18:34,590
Take a look.

300
00:18:35,090 --> 00:18:35,790
Look.

301
00:18:36,750 --> 00:18:38,400
They say the Grief Tree is magical.

302
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:38,880
Yeah.

303
00:18:38,900 --> 00:18:40,100
Yitan, look!

304
00:18:40,270 --> 00:18:41,200
The Grief Tree!

305
00:18:45,110 --> 00:18:46,170
So beautiful.

306
00:18:48,500 --> 00:18:52,140
If only the Grief Tree could also grant humans

307
00:18:52,470 --> 00:18:54,040
with renewed love

308
00:18:54,350 --> 00:18:55,550
in their next life...

309
00:18:59,150 --> 00:19:00,610
Humans only have one life.

310
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:03,500
It's enough to live without regrets.

311
00:19:03,800 --> 00:19:05,270
So unromantic.

312
00:19:07,570 --> 00:19:08,570
You're right too.

313
00:19:25,350 --> 00:19:26,790
Are you two interested

314
00:19:26,790 --> 00:19:28,720
in our Tushan red love knot?

315
00:19:28,830 --> 00:19:29,790
I have it already.

316
00:19:29,790 --> 00:19:30,590
Want one?

317
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:31,110
No.

318
00:19:32,410 --> 00:19:34,170
We bought from him before.

319
00:19:35,350 --> 00:19:36,250
Sir, Miss,

320
00:19:36,830 --> 00:19:37,720
would you like

321
00:19:37,720 --> 00:19:39,680
a pair of our Tushan red love knot?

322
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:41,120
They're very effective.

323
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:42,160
What knot?

324
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:45,560
The Tushan red love knot.

325
00:19:45,750 --> 00:19:48,270
They've been blessed by our Tushan leader

326
00:19:48,310 --> 00:19:49,400
personally.

327
00:19:49,510 --> 00:19:50,770
It's super effective.

328
00:19:51,510 --> 00:19:54,030
I didn't know the Tushan leader was in this business too.

329
00:19:54,030 --> 00:19:54,960
Of course!

330
00:19:55,070 --> 00:19:55,920
Listen...

331
00:19:58,240 --> 00:20:00,040
Come, come closer.

332
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:01,680
Do you see these red threads?

333
00:20:01,680 --> 00:20:02,710
It's super red

334
00:20:03,030 --> 00:20:04,030
because it's dyed

335
00:20:04,070 --> 00:20:05,860
with the juice of the flowers

336
00:20:06,030 --> 00:20:07,070
from the Grief Tree!

337
00:20:07,070 --> 00:20:08,310
I don't tell this to just anyone.

338
00:20:08,310 --> 00:20:09,030
Take a look.

339
00:20:15,240 --> 00:20:16,110
Have a look.

340
00:20:16,270 --> 00:20:17,200
The love knot.

341
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:20,480
Tushan forbids humans from entering.

342
00:20:20,830 --> 00:20:22,230
How'd you get the flowers

343
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:23,240
from the Grief Tree?

344
00:20:23,240 --> 00:20:24,280
Um...

345
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:26,070
The wind blew them here.

346
00:20:26,070 --> 00:20:26,920
Yitan.

347
00:20:27,030 --> 00:20:28,310
What's with the interrogation?

348
00:20:28,310 --> 00:20:29,970
They're just doing business.

349
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:31,240
Yes, yes.

350
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:37,350
Pay him.

351
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:41,590
This is called...

352
00:20:41,680 --> 00:20:43,640
The Tushan red love knot.

353
00:20:43,790 --> 00:20:44,590
The love knot.

354
00:20:44,590 --> 00:20:45,510
Right, right.

355
00:20:45,510 --> 00:20:46,500
We'll buy it.

356
00:20:46,680 --> 00:20:48,200
Thank you, Miss. Thank you.

357
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:49,720
Pay him. Quickly.

358
00:20:50,110 --> 00:20:51,280
Thank you, Miss.

359
00:20:54,790 --> 00:20:55,750
Thank you, Sir.

360
00:20:55,880 --> 00:20:56,740
Enjoy, you two.

361
00:21:00,270 --> 00:21:01,000
Wait,

362
00:21:01,510 --> 00:21:02,590
you believe in

363
00:21:02,790 --> 00:21:03,650
such nonsense?

364
00:21:04,310 --> 00:21:06,350
They're selling a sentiment.

365
00:21:08,510 --> 00:21:09,240
A story.

366
00:21:09,740 --> 00:21:11,500
We're selling a story.

367
00:21:12,310 --> 00:21:13,880
When you get home,

368
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:16,170
you must not cut these red threads.

369
00:21:16,510 --> 00:21:18,270
If you two can hold hands

370
00:21:18,680 --> 00:21:20,160
and spend the night with it,

371
00:21:20,160 --> 00:21:21,960
I guarantee your love will last

372
00:21:21,960 --> 00:21:22,680
forever.

373
00:21:22,750 --> 00:21:23,310
Got it?

374
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:25,090
Your love will last forever.

375
00:21:25,240 --> 00:21:26,640
Forever and ever!

376
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:27,160
Got it?

377
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:30,140
This sells the best.

378
00:21:45,790 --> 00:21:48,160
You believe in such scams?

379
00:21:48,270 --> 00:21:50,790

00:39:30,150 --> 00:39:30,840
Zui.

570
00:39:33,110 --> 00:39:33,920
I'm sorry.

571
00:40:14,880 --> 00:40:15,960
I don't blame you.

572
00:40:19,040 --> 00:40:20,630
But let's make this clear.

573
00:40:21,280 --> 00:40:22,760
When I get better,

574
00:40:24,590 --> 00:40:27,230
you owe me several jars of good wine.

575
00:40:29,810 --> 00:40:30,870
Drink with me then.
