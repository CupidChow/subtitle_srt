106
00:08:01,890 --> 00:08:04,490
Also, Huaizhu has been vomiting a lot lately.

107
00:08:04,870 --> 00:08:06,730
She says her mouth tastes bitter.

108
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:09,810
I remember when my wife was with child,

109
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:11,390
she felt uncomfortable too.

110
00:08:11,390 --> 00:08:12,850
Why don't we have the kitchen

111
00:08:12,850 --> 00:08:15,710
prepare something sweet and sour to stimulate her appetite?

112
00:08:15,710 --> 00:08:17,140
Okay, get on with it then.

113
00:08:17,190 --> 00:08:17,720
Okay.

114
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:31,870

115
00:08:33,700 --> 00:08:35,450
So many snacks.

116
00:08:36,270 --> 00:08:38,750
Mr. Fei said you haven't had much of an appetite,

117
00:08:38,750 --> 00:08:39,880
so I prepared these.

118
00:08:39,970 --> 00:08:41,320
Maybe they'll help a bit.

119
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:42,380
If you need anything,

120
00:08:42,380 --> 00:08:44,179
like things you want to eat or do,

121
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:45,250
tell me anytime.

122
00:08:47,670 --> 00:08:51,260
There is something I really want to do.

123
00:08:51,750 --> 00:08:52,360
What is it?

124
00:08:53,110 --> 00:08:54,590
I was thinking our family

125
00:08:55,630 --> 00:08:58,230
could visit the Bamboo Pavilion by River Huai.

126
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:02,630
Sure.

127
00:09:03,410 --> 00:09:04,780
On July 7th next year,

128
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:07,150
we'll take our child along with us.

129
00:09:09,850 --> 00:09:12,090
How will we get there?

130
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:13,240
Just like before.

131
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:15,950
I'll ride my sword, and you'll ride your flute.

132
00:09:15,950 --> 00:09:17,180
Holding the child?

133
00:09:19,820 --> 00:09:22,030
I'll need to bring some spare clothes,

134
00:09:22,090 --> 00:09:23,750
so the baby doesn't pee on you.

135
00:09:28,630 --> 00:09:29,630
Nauseated again?

136
00:09:30,760 --> 00:09:32,090
I'll get you some water.

137
00:09:49,640 --> 00:09:50,720
Esteemed elders,

138
00:09:51,450 --> 00:09:53,680
the Yiqi Alliance has lost many talents,

139
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:55,480
and the demon realm is in chaos.

140
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:57,880
Regarding the current situation,

141
00:09:57,880 --> 00:09:59,740
I have a way to break the deadlock.

142
00:10:00,390 --> 00:10:01,680
How can we break it?

143
00:10:01,710 --> 00:10:04,530
If willing, the women of the Dongfang family

144
00:10:04,700 --> 00:10:07,700
can pass on their spiritual energy to their children.

145
00:10:07,820 --> 00:10:10,400
Then, using the Wangquan's unique secret technique,

146
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:13,260
we can help awaken the child's innate sword spirit.

147
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:15,080
This will allow the child

148
00:10:15,100 --> 00:10:18,330
to possess the talents of both great families.

149
00:10:19,180 --> 00:10:20,020
This is

150
00:10:20,910 --> 00:10:22,040
the Yiqi Alliance's

151
00:10:22,830 --> 00:10:23,500
warrior.

152
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:26,360
You mean

153
00:10:26,610 --> 00:10:28,200
your child with Hongye

154
00:10:28,270 --> 00:10:29,870
will combine the Dongfang Spiritual Blood

155
00:10:29,870 --> 00:10:32,430
with the essence of the Wangquan swordsmanship

156
00:10:32,430 --> 00:10:35,090
to wield the most powerful Unparalleled Sword?

157
00:10:59,120 --> 00:10:59,970
Hongye.

158
00:11:00,410 --> 00:11:01,310
Get more rest.

159
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:09,760
Did you stay up all night?

160
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:14,460
I went out to attend to some business.

161
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:25,010
Huaizhu.

162
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:28,450
Can I...

163
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:31,640
touch it?

164
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:35,160
Of course.

165
00:11:53,410 --> 00:11:54,770
It's fine now.

166
00:12:05,610 --> 00:12:06,560
Hongye.

167
00:12:07,790 --> 00:12:09,290
The path you want to take

168
00:12:09,590 --> 00:12:11,110
has rarely been trodden.

169
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:13,210
Feeling lost

170
00:12:14,030 --> 00:12:15,350
or uncertain

171
00:12:16,090 --> 00:12:17,370
are necessary stages.

172
00:12:18,280 --> 00:12:20,640
Your current struggle is because

173
00:12:21,670 --> 00:12:23,550
you don't want to give up, right?

174
00:12:29,520 --> 00:12:30,930
I don't want this world

175
00:12:32,390 --> 00:12:33,960
to stay like what it is now.

176
00:12:35,940 --> 00:12:37,520
I also don't want our child

177
00:12:38,860 --> 00:12:40,460
to be born into such a world.

178
00:12:44,120 --> 00:12:44,910
Then,

179
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:48,480
for the sake of our family

180
00:12:49,480 --> 00:12:50,880
or for the world,

181
00:12:51,900 --> 00:12:55,110
go and do what you believe is right.

182
00:13:12,110 --> 00:13:13,770
Greetings, Master Wangquan.

183
00:13:13,870 --> 00:13:14,930
Greetings, Madam.

184
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:18,620
It's been months since we met.

185
00:13:18,630 --> 00:13:21,000
Master, your hair's turned completely gray.

186
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,330
It's tough at the Yiqi Alliance, isn't it?

187
00:13:24,260 --> 00:13:26,900
I think everyone is having a tough time.

188
00:13:28,650 --> 00:13:30,250
You still finally did it.

189
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:32,970
But the price was too high.

190
00:13:35,730 --> 00:13:38,330
We have matters to discuss with Tushan.

191
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:45,560
The Yiqi Alliance and the demon realm are in constant conflict,

192
00:13:45,560 --> 00:13:46,880
and it's worsening.

193
00:13:46,860 --> 00:13:51,830
[Human Realm] [Demon Realm]

194
00:13:46,930 --> 00:13:47,990
If this continues,

195
00:13:48,030 --> 00:13:50,230
the hatred in this world will only grow.

196
00:13:50,230 --> 00:13:51,990
We can't repeat the same mistakes.

197
00:13:51,990 --> 00:13:53,600
So the Yiqi Alliance and the demon realm

198
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:55,540
should establish rules for peaceful coexistence,

199
00:13:55,540 --> 00:13:56,960
demarcate their respective territories,

200
00:13:56,960 --> 00:13:57,960
recuperate,

201
00:13:58,080 --> 00:13:59,340
and reduce conflicts.

202
00:13:59,870 --> 00:14:01,540
The demon realm is so vast.

203
00:14:01,770 --> 00:14:04,200
It's not something Tushan can decide on its own.

204
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:05,100
The chaos in the demon realm

205
00:14:05,100 --> 00:14:06,180
is due to the lack of a leader,

206
00:14:06,180 --> 00:14:09,240
and only Tushan has the ability to lead the demon realm.

207
00:14:10,270 --> 00:14:11,240
But why should

208
00:14:11,260 --> 00:14:13,610
Tushan do such a thankless task?

209
00:14:14,050 --> 00:14:15,420
Isn't it better to live

210
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:18,170
a carefree and happy life in Tushan's territory?

211
00:14:19,030 --> 00:14:20,710
I can guarantee on behalf of my sister

212
00:14:20,710 --> 00:14:23,630
that the Tushan fox demons will never invade the Yiqi Alliance,

213
00:14:23,630 --> 00:14:25,860
but beyond that, I'm afraid we can't do much.

214
00:14:25,860 --> 00:14:26,510
But—

215
00:14:26,550 --> 00:14:27,360
But what?

216
00:14:27,560 --> 00:14:30,160
With great power comes great responsibility?

217
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:31,360
Master Wangquan.

218
00:14:31,790 --> 00:14:33,790
Where did your white hair come from?

219
00:14:34,120 --> 00:14:35,150
The responsibilities you've taken on

220
00:14:35,150 --> 00:14:36,600
and the sacrifices you've made,

221
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:38,460
have they brought you happiness?

222
00:14:40,850 --> 00:14:42,180
Humans, unlike demons,

223
00:14:42,760 --> 00:14:44,750
have only a few decades to live.

224
00:14:44,870 --> 00:14:47,510
Shouldn't you cherish the present even more?

225
00:14:54,270 --> 00:14:57,800
Alright, the scenery in Tushan is beautiful lately.

226
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,130
The Grief Tree is also being restored.

227
00:15:00,380 --> 00:15:02,930
Why don't you stay here with your wife

228
00:15:03,030 --> 00:15:04,760
and take some time off to relax?

229
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:08,650
Thank you.

230
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:22,790
This season is so pleasant.

231
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:25,800
Yes, the scenery here is beautiful too.

232
00:15:26,950 --> 00:15:29,810
It seems you're not surprised by Tushan's refusal.

233
00:15:31,150 --> 00:15:33,080
When I didn't see Tushan Honghong,

234
00:15:33,390 --> 00:15:34,670
I expected it.

235
00:15:35,490 --> 00:15:36,870
Such a big matter

236
00:15:37,080 --> 00:15:38,720
can't be decided overnight.

237
00:15:39,510 --> 00:15:40,720
It takes time.

238
00:15:43,070 --> 00:15:43,830
Huaizhu.

239
00:15:45,670 --> 00:15:48,000
Tushan Yaya said something right.

240
00:15:49,010 --> 00:15:50,700
We all think life is long,

241
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:53,800
and there's so much we can do.

242
00:15:54,190 --> 00:15:55,830
We always think we'll start

243
00:15:56,340 --> 00:15:57,770
when the time is right.

244
00:15:59,530 --> 00:16:01,190
But either we never get there,

245
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:03,960
or while waiting and hoping,

246
00:16:05,390 --> 00:16:07,320
we miss the most important moment.

247
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:10,670
And right now,

248
00:16:11,390 --> 00:16:13,960
with you and our child by my side,

249
00:16:14,630 --> 00:16:15,550
I'm very happy

250
00:16:16,790 --> 00:16:17,750
and content.

251
00:16:20,830 --> 00:16:21,780
So am I.

252
00:16:27,070 --> 00:16:29,740
Let's... go for a walk.

253
00:16:32,270 --> 00:16:35,120
I want to go see the Grief Tree.

254
00:16:35,500 --> 00:16:36,550
I'll go with you.

255
00:16:37,220 --> 00:16:38,880
Since we're rarely in Tushan,

256
00:16:39,330 --> 00:16:41,220
why don't you go check out the market?

257
00:16:41,220 --> 00:16:43,820
See if there's anything we can buy to take home.

258
00:16:47,400 --> 00:16:48,210
Don't worry.

259
00:16:53,050 --> 00:16:53,640
Alright.

260
00:16:54,330 --> 00:16:56,580
I'll meet you at the Grief Tree later.

261
00:17:19,329 --> 00:17:20,990
It's changed a lot, hasn't it?

262
00:17:23,790 --> 00:17:24,510
Yes.

263
00:17:26,510 --> 00:17:27,680
It has changed a lot.

264
00:17:29,030 --> 00:17:31,830
It's the season of falling flowers.

265
00:17:34,590 --> 00:17:35,790
Different seasons

266
00:17:36,530 --> 00:17:37,970
have their own beauty.

267
00:17:53,290 --> 00:17:55,690
Your foundation's been severely damaged.

268
00:17:55,830 --> 00:17:58,090
Do you know you don't have much time left?

269
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,000
Even so, you still

270
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:02,830
want to use the Dongfang Spiritual Blood

271
00:18:02,830 --> 00:18:04,030
to conceive a child?

272
00:18:05,830 --> 00:18:07,360
This breach of the Boundary

273
00:18:07,510 --> 00:18:10,640
has destroyed all the young elites of the Yiqi Alliance.

274
00:18:11,350 --> 00:18:13,280
Although the Black Fox was killed,

275
00:18:14,060 --> 00:18:15,660
you sent a message telling me

276
00:18:16,550 --> 00:18:18,750
that the Black Grief Tree still exists.

277
00:18:19,370 --> 00:18:22,410
That means the Black Fox will still return.

278
00:18:24,030 --> 00:18:27,510
A child born from the union of the Dongfang and Wangquan families

279
00:18:27,510 --> 00:18:29,970
will possess the strongest innate talents.

280
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:32,110
It...

281
00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:35,940
will be the hope to kill the Black Fox.

282
00:18:37,070 --> 00:18:38,160
Is that all?

283
00:18:39,790 --> 00:18:40,990
What matters most...

284
00:18:49,310 --> 00:18:50,640
