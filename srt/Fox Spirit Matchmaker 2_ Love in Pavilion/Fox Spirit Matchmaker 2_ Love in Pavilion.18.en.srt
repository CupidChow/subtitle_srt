[Episode 18]

3
00:02:14,970 --> 00:02:17,150
If Jia Lan hadn't met me,

4
00:02:18,710 --> 00:02:21,360
she might not have
suffered so much in her life.

5
00:02:24,079 --> 00:02:26,400
I failed to keep her safe.

6
00:02:27,030 --> 00:02:27,960
So…

7
00:02:30,650 --> 00:02:32,810
I don't care how many people will die.

8
00:02:34,610 --> 00:02:37,140
I don't care if it'll cost me my life.

9
00:02:38,079 --> 00:02:41,210
You people don't deserve to live anyway.

10
00:03:38,430 --> 00:03:39,400
Jiuhuo.

11
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:54,800
The Golden Dawn.

12
00:03:56,329 --> 00:03:57,370
Jiuhuo.

13
00:04:04,090 --> 00:04:05,460
The Golden Dawn.

14
00:04:05,480 --> 00:04:07,280
You've repaired the Golden Dawn?

15
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:09,210
Whether it's for humans or demons,

16
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:12,430
life is full of surprises.

17
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:17,420
The Golden Dawn is in my hands now.

18
00:04:35,310 --> 00:04:37,370
I had given up hope,

19
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:39,230
but unexpectedly,

20
00:04:39,950 --> 00:04:42,360
fortune smiled on me.

21
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:44,720
I doubt you can stop me now.

22
00:04:47,830 --> 00:04:49,490
Let's go get Yitan and Quzhuo.

23
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:50,480
After him.

24
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:25,560
You've arrived just in time.

25
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:26,800
Join me

26
00:05:26,870 --> 00:05:28,840
in welcoming Jia Lan's return.

27
00:05:29,250 --> 00:05:30,100
Break!

28
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:49,200
She is

29
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:52,860
the evil creature
we encountered beyond the Boundary:

30
00:05:53,490 --> 00:05:54,950
the Black Fox.

31
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,070
Lord Jiuhuo,

32
00:05:59,460 --> 00:06:01,320
thank you for everything you did.

33
00:06:01,710 --> 00:06:02,870
Jia Lan.

34
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:09,590
United as one.

35
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:17,240
United as one?

36
00:06:17,740 --> 00:06:20,680
I despise such human nonsense the most.

37
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:24,190
Quzhuo!

38
00:06:44,220 --> 00:06:46,980
The vessel for my soul is here as well.

39
00:06:49,830 --> 00:06:51,190
She's not a vessel.

40
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:53,440
She is Dongfang Huaizhu!

41
00:06:54,950 --> 00:06:58,270
You speak as if you have any say in this.

42
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:16,510
Quzhuo.

00:07:26,310 --> 00:07:27,160
Hongye.

44
00:07:27,980 --> 00:07:28,950
You all leave!

45
00:07:35,750 --> 00:07:39,950
My brother was a lunatic
obsessed with talismans.

46
00:07:40,950 --> 00:07:43,680
He left me thousands of them.

47
00:07:44,810 --> 00:07:45,960
Today,

48
00:07:46,390 --> 00:07:49,040
I'll show you what they can do.

Whether the ending can be changed or not,

51
00:08:57,370 --> 00:08:58,900
I, Li Quzhuo,

52
00:09:00,390 --> 00:09:03,670
was together with all my brothers

53
00:09:04,390 --> 00:09:06,290
from the Mask Group today.

54
00:09:19,910 --> 00:09:21,110
They're coming back.

55
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:24,600

-Hongye.

-Zui.

Huaizhu.

59
00:09:27,670 --> 00:09:29,190
Zui, are you alright?

60
00:09:29,220 --> 00:09:29,550
I'm fine.

61
00:09:29,550 --> 00:09:30,150
How are you?

62
00:09:30,150 --> 00:09:30,790
Hongye.

63
00:09:30,900 --> 00:09:32,160
Huaizhu, are you okay?

64
00:09:32,550 --> 00:09:33,550
Hongye, Hongye!

65
00:09:33,550 --> 00:09:34,120
Hongye!

00:09:47,550 --> 00:09:48,280
Father.

69
00:09:52,030 --> 00:09:54,790
It's good that you're home.

70
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:58,510
With me here,

71
00:09:59,080 --> 00:10:01,320
Young Master Wangquan will be fine.

72
00:10:07,470 --> 00:10:09,740
He brought you home safe.

73
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:14,440
I didn't expect
someone so young to be so brave.

74
00:10:14,910 --> 00:10:15,750
Good.

75
00:10:24,030 --> 00:10:26,090
I'm relieved that Hongye is alright.

76
00:10:35,670 --> 00:10:36,670
Zui.

77
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:38,530
This room has the best lighting.

78
00:10:38,530 --> 00:10:39,530
You can stay here.

79
00:10:39,700 --> 00:10:41,550
Young Master Yang will stay across from you.

80
00:10:41,550 --> 00:10:43,510
You guys must have a lot to talk about.

81
00:10:43,510 --> 00:10:44,720
I'll leave you to it.

82
00:10:45,790 --> 00:10:46,390
Thank you.

83
00:10:51,180 --> 00:10:52,790
This place looks great.

84
00:10:52,900 --> 00:10:54,840
Guess it was worth
getting dragged around by that girl

85
00:10:54,840 --> 00:10:56,240
to repair all the magical artifacts

86
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:57,640
in the Divine Fire Villa.

87

Li Quzhuo.

88
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:02,120
Stand up.

89
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:03,790
What for?

90
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:11,510
I...

91
00:11:11,530 --> 00:11:14,100
Y-You… W-What…

92
00:11:14,790 --> 00:11:15,850
What are you doing?

93
00:11:17,910 --> 00:11:19,710
It's really wonderful to see you

94
00:11:19,750 --> 00:11:20,810
as soon as I'm back.

95
00:11:21,460 --> 00:11:22,810
From now on,

96
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:24,920
I won't bully you ever again.

97
00:11:25,230 --> 00:11:28,380
I'll be a thousand times nicer to you.

98
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:31,670
Zui,

99
00:11:33,080 --> 00:11:34,550
you've changed.

100
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:36,720
Come on.

101
00:11:37,910 --> 00:11:39,240
Call me Fourth Brother.

102
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:42,770
Fourth Brother.

103

Fourth Brother!

105
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:51,520
Tell me, what do you want?

106
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:53,200
I will do everything possible

107
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:54,390
to get it for you.

108
00:11:56,510 --> 00:11:58,110
I just want you to stay alive.

109
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:01,270
And you guys,

110
00:12:02,610 --> 00:12:04,140
I want you to stay alive too.

111
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:07,270
Well…

112
00:12:11,910 --> 00:12:12,790
Something really bad

113
00:12:12,790 --> 00:12:14,990
happened 20 years in the future, right?

114
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,000
So,

115
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:23,960
20 years later,
in the war between humans and demons,

116
00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:28,160
the Yiqi Alliance was destroyed,
and the Mask Group suffered heavy losses.

117
00:12:28,980 --> 00:12:30,020
And I

118
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:33,320
was the one who lived the longest.

119
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:36,320
You only made it back alive

120
00:12:37,750 --> 00:12:39,510
because I

121
00:12:39,910 --> 00:12:41,350
sacrificed myself?

122
00:12:43,590 --> 00:12:46,490
So I was still super dope when I was old!

123
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:53,440
Why the long faces? You're all back now.

124
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:54,910
It means the ending
can definitely be changed.

125
00:12:54,910 --> 00:12:56,110
Don't look so gloomy.

126
00:12:56,390 --> 00:12:57,080
Smile.

127
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:02,080
You're right.

128
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:03,870
Since we're all back,

129
00:13:04,340 --> 00:13:05,940
there must still be a chance.

130
00:13:06,630 --> 00:13:09,560
Right. There's something
I need to discuss with you.

131
00:13:09,630 --> 00:13:12,120
This magical artifact—
making and activating it

132
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:14,320
requires an enormous amount of energy.

133
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:16,360
This golden lotus

134
00:13:16,510 --> 00:13:17,870
is basically wrecked.

135
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:20,600
But if I carefully repair it,

136
00:13:20,790 --> 00:13:22,120
there's a chance it could be restored.

137
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:23,320
It must be destroyed.

138
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:26,120
Is it possible for Jiuhuo

139
00:13:26,870 --> 00:13:27,870
to make

140
00:13:27,870 --> 00:13:29,280
an exact replica of this thing?

141
00:13:29,280 --> 00:13:30,480
That's not possible.

142
00:13:30,750 --> 00:13:32,080
This golden lotus may not look like much,

143
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:33,200
but every component inside

144
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:34,360
is a rare treasure.

145
00:13:34,840 --> 00:13:35,550
Good.

146
00:13:36,150 --> 00:13:38,030
So we must destroy this thing

147
00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:39,830
to cut off any chance

148
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,600
for Jiuhuo and the Black Fox
to enter our world.

[Shennong's Herbal Classics]

150
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:06,600
If one of us must die,

151
00:14:07,590 --> 00:14:08,990
that person won't be you.

152
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:10,550
She's not a vessel.

153
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:13,030
She is Dongfang Huaizhu!

154
00:14:14,830 --> 00:14:16,190
Why would you

155
00:14:16,680 --> 00:14:18,680
go that far to save me?

156
00:14:20,620 --> 00:14:22,380
I've never thought about it.

157
00:14:23,100 --> 00:14:24,960
Then what have you thought about?

158
00:14:25,160 --> 00:14:26,620
That I must never lose you.

159
00:14:36,510 --> 00:14:37,270
Senior.

160
00:14:37,740 --> 00:14:39,190
Master sent me to tell you

161
00:14:39,280 --> 00:14:40,560
that Young Master Wangquan is fine.

162
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:41,460
You don't need to worry.

163
00:14:41,460 --> 00:14:42,790
I'll go check on him now.

164
00:14:44,590 --> 00:14:45,540
Junior Huaizhu,

165
00:14:46,640 --> 00:14:50,160
when did you
hook up with Young Master Wangquan?

166
00:14:52,470 --> 00:14:55,710
As your senior, I didn't even notice.

167
00:14:57,620 --> 00:15:00,420
My affairs are none of your concern.

168
00:15:06,990 --> 00:15:09,940
You favor Wangquan Hongye so much.

169
00:15:10,090 --> 00:15:13,350
Isn't it just because
he's the heir of the Wangquan family?

170
00:15:13,430 --> 00:15:15,000
One day,

171
00:15:15,390 --> 00:15:19,670
I, Jin Renfeng,
will crush him beneath my feet.

172
00:15:46,960 --> 00:15:47,750
Yitan.

173
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:50,320
Are you still thinking about Mu Mie?

174
00:15:52,670 --> 00:15:54,870
When the Black Fox breaks the Boundary,

175
00:15:55,030 --> 00:15:56,360
eternal night befalls.

176
00:15:57,130 --> 00:15:59,530
I wonder how things
will turn out for Mu Mie.

177
00:16:05,030 --> 00:16:07,510
Mu Mie's personality is just like yours.

178
00:16:07,750 --> 00:16:10,720
I believe he won't give up hope.

179
00:16:11,580 --> 00:16:14,890
Besides, as long as we change the future,

180
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:17,750
he'll be safe for sure.

181
00:16:26,270 --> 00:16:29,000
Of course, if you really miss him,

182
00:16:29,240 --> 00:16:31,370
after Aunt Yang Yan gives birth to him,

183
00:16:31,670 --> 00:16:34,000
we'll go see him together. How about that?

184
00:16:35,910 --> 00:16:37,440
Mu Mie did mention

185
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,660
that when he was six years old,

186
00:16:40,010 --> 00:16:42,040
a masked guy

187
00:16:42,060 --> 00:16:44,260
taught him to awaken his Clairvoyance.

188
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:47,440
But Quzhuo said

189
00:16:47,870 --> 00:16:49,150
that two years later,

190
00:16:49,550 --> 00:16:51,200
we'd all be dead.

191
00:16:52,030 --> 00:16:55,960
Then who is that masked guy who will teach Mu Mie

192
00:16:56,200 --> 00:16:57,270
Clairvoyance?

193
00:16:57,320 --> 00:17:00,080
Enough. Don't say we'll die again.

194
00:17:00,570 --> 00:17:01,410
Zui,

195
00:17:02,120 --> 00:17:03,870
you'll surely live a long life.

196
00:17:08,750 --> 00:17:09,750
You too, Yitan.

197
00:17:10,170 --> 00:17:11,770
You'll also live a long life.

198
00:17:12,550 --> 00:17:13,510
Because

199
00:17:14,290 --> 00:17:16,750
I'll never leave your side in this lifetime.

200
00:17:23,750 --> 00:17:24,550
Alright.

201
00:17:31,350 --> 00:17:32,400
Then…

202
00:17:33,880 --> 00:17:36,920
If I were to marry someone else,

203
00:17:37,730 --> 00:17:39,350
would you still be like this?

204
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:42,400
Would you still
stay by my side so devotedly?

205
00:17:46,510 --> 00:17:47,200
I would.

206
00:17:58,510 --> 00:18:01,110
Yitan, that's a good answer.

207
00:18:03,910 --> 00:18:05,510
But it's not the one I wanted.

208
00:18:21,350 --> 00:18:22,510
That golden lotus—

209
00:18:23,920 --> 00:18:25,790
you really burned it with a fire talisman?

210
00:18:25,790 --> 00:18:26,310
Yes.

211
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:29,070
Don't worry. I burned it to ashes.

212
00:18:29,590 --> 00:18:30,510
Gosh. You...

213
00:18:30,510 --> 00:18:32,030
You're too brutal!

214
00:18:32,030 --> 00:18:33,590
That magical artifact cost a fortune!

215
00:18:33,590 --> 00:18:35,270
You should've at least picked a good day

216
00:18:35,270 --> 00:18:36,870
and given it a grand funeral!

217
00:18:37,450 --> 00:18:38,250
You're right.

218
00:18:38,750 --> 00:18:39,880
I'll keep that in mind next time.

219
00:18:39,880 --> 00:18:40,400
I...

220
00:18:47,750 --> 00:18:48,790
What's wrong?

221
00:18:49,160 --> 00:18:49,960
Nothing.

222
00:18:51,270 --> 00:18:52,750
Look at your pouty face.

223
00:18:53,110 --> 00:18:54,790
Come on, tell me. Who upset you?

224
00:18:54,790 --> 00:18:56,590
I'll teach them a lesson for you.

225
00:19:07,160 --> 00:19:09,790
Is it someone from the Divine Fire Villa?

226
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:12,900
It's that Jin Renfeng
with slanted eyes, right?

227
00:19:13,510 --> 00:19:14,440
No.

228
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,600
It has nothing to do
with the Divine Fire Villa.

229
00:19:17,920 --> 00:19:19,000
Then who is it?

230
00:19:22,270 --> 00:19:23,070
Yitan?

231
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:29,650
I knew it!

232
00:19:29,680 --> 00:19:31,590
It must be
because of that arranged marriage.

233
00:19:31,590 --> 00:19:33,550
It's bothering you a lot, right?

234
00:19:34,070 --> 00:19:34,920
Don't worry.

235
00:19:35,350 --> 00:19:37,070
I'll go talk some sense into him right away.

236
00:19:37,070 --> 00:19:38,960
Today, I'll make that brat
write you a letter

237
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:40,440
to break off the engagement.

238
00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:41,830
As soon as he's done writing,

239
00:19:41,830 --> 00:19:44,350
I'll rush it to the Wangquan Manor.

240
00:19:44,440 --> 00:19:46,330
By then, before you even arrive,

241
00:19:47,030 --> 00:19:49,270
you'll already be free.

242
00:19:51,070 --> 00:19:52,510
I'm the best, aren't I?

243
00:19:57,720 --> 00:19:58,880
Don't worry, Zui.

244
00:19:59,070 --> 00:20:01,030
Yitan definitely has feelings for you.

245
00:20:01,030 --> 00:20:02,030
I swear.

246
00:20:02,310 --> 00:20:03,200
Really?

247
00:20:07,680 --> 00:20:08,640
What do you mean?

248
00:20:09,560 --> 00:20:11,770
Are you blind or what?

249
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,200
Haven't you noticed?

250
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:15,260
Since Zui returned from Sky City,

251
00:20:15,750 --> 00:20:17,880
the way she looks at Yitan has changed.

252
00:20:18,430 --> 00:20:19,760
She's already...

253
00:20:20,030 --> 00:20:22,070
a young woman who's fallen in love.

254
00:20:24,160 --> 00:20:24,880
She...

255
00:20:28,440 --> 00:20:29,110
Don't tell me

256
00:20:29,110 --> 00:20:31,160
you've fallen for Yang Yitan!

257
00:20:35,710 --> 00:20:36,580
You fool!

258
00:20:36,750 --> 00:20:38,550
Can't you get a grip on yourself?

259
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:47,490
Don't tell me he doesn't like you back!

260
00:21:14,750 --> 00:21:16,070
Why are you up?

261
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:17,310
Sit down.

262
00:21:26,610 --> 00:21:29,010
You've been taking care of me all this time?

263
00:21:30,660 --> 00:21:32,870
You're much better now. Good.

264
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:38,790
Thank you.

265
00:21:44,290 --> 00:21:45,750
Take your medicine first.

266
00:21:48,030 --> 00:21:49,290
What about the others?

267
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:51,590
They're all fine. Don't worry.

268
00:21:53,270 --> 00:21:54,110
That's good.

269
00:22:00,850 --> 00:22:02,250
What did you dream about?

270
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:08,200
Every year on your death anniversary,

271
00:22:06,770 --> 00:22:12,590
[To Hongye
From Huaizhu]

272
00:22:08,590 --> 00:22:10,030
she'd bring a letter

273
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:12,440
to your cenotaph.

274
00:22:13,880 --> 00:22:15,340
There aren't many letters

275
00:22:16,070 --> 00:22:20,190
because 10 years
after you went beyond the Boundary,

276
00:22:23,560 --> 00:22:25,020
she passed away.

277
00:22:27,390 --> 00:22:29,090
Wangquan Hongye,

278
00:22:29,480 --> 00:22:31,860
you're destined to lose your loved one.

279
00:22:32,030 --> 00:22:34,510
All struggles are futile.

280
00:22:38,900 --> 00:22:40,140
I dreamed…

281
00:22:42,110 --> 00:22:43,710
we were very happy together.

282
00:22:44,460 --> 00:22:45,830
So happy that

283
00:22:46,310 --> 00:22:47,880
you gritted your teeth

284
00:22:48,310 --> 00:22:49,710
and furrowed your brows?

285
00:22:54,790 --> 00:22:55,720
The wound hurts.

286
00:22:58,110 --> 00:23:00,700
Miss, if Young Master Wangquan is awake,

287
00:23:00,750 --> 00:23:02,410
Master wants him to come over.

288
00:23:02,770 --> 00:23:04,690
Alright, I see.

289
00:23:08,270 --> 00:23:09,800
Your father wants to see me?

290
00:23:15,350 --> 00:23:16,310
I should go then.

291
00:23:17,940 --> 00:23:19,270
You're going like this?

292
00:23:21,310 --> 00:23:22,570
When you see my father,

293
00:23:22,590 --> 00:23:24,640
don't be nervous. Relax.

294
00:23:34,850 --> 00:23:35,780
I'm not nervous.

295
00:23:49,160 --> 00:23:50,680
The last dish is here!

296
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:52,590
Eat up.

297
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:54,440
Father, try a drumstick.

298
00:23:56,350 --> 00:23:58,960
Qinlan, go back to your room and rest.

299
00:23:59,310 --> 00:24:03,350
I need to
have a few words with Young Master Wangquan.

300
00:24:04,070 --> 00:24:05,830
He's not your son-in-law.

301
00:24:05,920 --> 00:24:07,720
What do you have to say to him?

302
00:24:08,030 --> 00:24:09,030
I'll just sit here

303
00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:10,600
and pour wine for you.

304
00:24:19,310 --> 00:24:22,510
Sitting stiffly like this

305
00:24:23,030 --> 00:24:24,310
isn't comfortable.

306
00:24:25,270 --> 00:24:27,680
Why don't we relax a little?

307
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:29,030
Alright.

308
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:35,750
I have diabetes.

309
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:37,000
I can't drink alcohol.

310
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:39,030
You can help yourself to the wine.

311
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:41,030
Okay.

312
00:24:46,920 --> 00:24:48,120
To you, Mr. Dongfang.

313
00:24:51,720 --> 00:24:55,510
In the south, we always
have vinegar with our cold dishes.

314
00:24:56,630 --> 00:24:58,260
You just drank vinegar.

315
00:25:06,830 --> 00:25:07,830
It's appetizing.

316
00:25:12,070 --> 00:25:13,270
Can you cook?

317
00:25:13,470 --> 00:25:14,380
A real man

318
00:25:15,750 --> 00:25:16,790
stays away from the kitchen.

319
00:25:16,790 --> 00:25:17,550
Is that so?

320
00:25:18,470 --> 00:25:22,320
These are all dishes that Huaizhu loves.

321
00:25:23,350 --> 00:25:24,400
I made them.

322
00:25:29,240 --> 00:25:30,170
A true gentleman

323
00:25:31,070 --> 00:25:32,270
is good at cooking.

324
00:25:33,820 --> 00:25:38,160
So, Young Master, are you a real man

325
00:25:38,270 --> 00:25:40,720
or a true gentleman?

326
00:25:41,590 --> 00:25:42,440
Well,

327
00:25:44,310 --> 00:25:46,550
that depends on you, Mr. Dongfang.

328
00:25:48,330 --> 00:25:49,660
I can be either.

329
00:25:51,400 --> 00:25:54,110
I've heard that you're decisive and ruthless,

330
00:25:54,270 --> 00:25:56,680
an unyielding tough guy.

331
00:25:57,820 --> 00:25:59,750
I don't like tough guys.

332
00:26:01,160 --> 00:26:02,640
Your ambition is to rule the world,

333
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:04,240
and you're destined for greatness.

334
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:05,960
Because of this, you

335
00:26:06,070 --> 00:26:07,200
can't make pastries

336
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:08,550
or cook fish soup.

337
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:11,960
You can't take good care of my Huaizhu.

338
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:15,110
I can learn.

339
00:26:15,160 --> 00:26:16,720
You know what I mean.

340
00:26:18,200 --> 00:26:21,450
Huaizhu doesn't like power struggles,

341
00:26:21,550 --> 00:26:25,790
but you're at the center of that storm.

342
00:26:32,750 --> 00:26:35,550
Mr. Dongfang, please give me some time.

343
00:26:35,790 --> 00:26:38,030
I'll certainly take care of everything.

344
00:26:38,030 --> 00:26:39,560
As long as Huaizhu is happy,

345
00:26:39,680 --> 00:26:41,920
I don't mind plain meals

346
00:26:42,350 --> 00:26:43,350
and a quiet life.

347
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:47,750
You know what?

348
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:51,450
A lot of suitors
have come to ask for her hand,

349
00:26:51,510 --> 00:26:52,920
but none of them

350
00:26:52,920 --> 00:26:54,350
have had the privilege

351
00:26:54,350 --> 00:26:57,350
of pouring me a cup of wine.

352
00:27:01,790 --> 00:27:02,350
Yes.

353
00:27:07,640 --> 00:27:08,440
Mr. Dongfang.

354
00:27:17,430 --> 00:27:19,020
I like that smile of yours.

355
00:27:19,320 --> 00:27:20,070
Don't sit there

356
00:27:20,070 --> 00:27:21,880
like the stone lion outside my gate.

357
00:27:21,880 --> 00:27:23,390
Come on, relax.

358
00:27:23,640 --> 00:27:25,590
Let's have a good drink together
as father and son.

359
00:27:25,590 --> 00:27:26,440
Sure.

360
00:27:26,510 --> 00:27:27,910
Thank you, Mr. Dongfang.

361
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:28,790
Come on.

362
00:27:30,680 --> 00:27:31,050
Cheers.

363
00:27:31,050 --> 00:27:31,720
Cheers.

364
00:27:33,720 --> 00:27:35,680
Don't drink alone.

365
00:27:35,680 --> 00:27:37,110
I…

366
00:27:38,070 --> 00:27:40,000
F-From now on,

367
00:27:40,350 --> 00:27:42,030
if anyone else comes to propose,

368
00:27:42,030 --> 00:27:43,310
I'll tell them

369
00:27:44,110 --> 00:27:48,830
Huaizhu is already spoken for.

370
00:27:51,310 --> 00:27:52,510
That's so kind of you.

371
00:27:53,400 --> 00:27:55,430
You're so kind, Mr. Dongfang.

372
00:27:55,640 --> 00:27:57,930
S-Stop calling me Mr. Dongfang.

373
00:27:58,240 --> 00:27:59,370
Call me Big Brother.

374
00:28:00,680 --> 00:28:01,410
Big Brother.

375
00:28:04,750 --> 00:28:08,020
I have everything here at home,

376
00:28:08,160 --> 00:28:10,310
except for good wine.

377
00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:13,130
Big Brother,

378
00:28:14,110 --> 00:28:15,110
I have good wine.

379
00:28:15,830 --> 00:28:17,110
I'll have someone bring it over.

380
00:28:17,110 --> 00:28:17,960
Bring it over.

381
00:28:19,640 --> 00:28:20,680
Bro.

382
00:28:21,070 --> 00:28:22,940
Have you kept in mind

383
00:28:23,240 --> 00:28:24,510
everything I told you?

384
00:28:25,790 --> 00:28:27,250
You're looking down on me.

385
00:28:27,310 --> 00:28:28,420
Are you looking down on me?

386
00:28:28,420 --> 00:28:29,620
Let me prove it to you.

387
00:28:29,880 --> 00:28:30,880
L-Let me…

388
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:31,510
Go ahead.

389
00:28:31,510 --> 00:28:32,030
Let me…

390
00:28:32,830 --> 00:28:33,680
Let me…

391
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:38,850
Huaizhu likes to eat

392
00:28:39,110 --> 00:28:40,440
steamed lamb,

393
00:28:40,510 --> 00:28:41,790
steamed bear paw,

394
00:28:41,830 --> 00:28:43,000
steamed deer tail,

395
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:43,830
roasted duck,

396
00:28:43,830 --> 00:28:44,790
roasted chick,

397
00:28:44,790 --> 00:28:45,830
roasted gosling,

398
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:47,000
braised meat, braised duck,

399
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:48,720
soy sauce chicken,
cured meat, and pork knuckle with pine nuts…

400
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:50,400
Who said I like all those things?

401
00:28:50,400 --> 00:28:51,440
Who said that?

402
00:28:53,560 --> 00:28:55,290
Big Brother, I think I'm drunk.

403
00:28:55,890 --> 00:28:57,030
Is Huaizhu here?

404
00:28:58,510 --> 00:28:59,750
I saw her too.

405
00:29:00,270 --> 00:29:04,520
First, who allowed you to drink, Father?

406
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:06,640
Who allowed it?

407
00:29:07,960 --> 00:29:10,310
Second, was wine not enough

408
00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:11,880
that you had to drink vinegar too?

409
00:29:11,880 --> 00:29:13,350
That was vinegar!

410
00:29:13,510 --> 00:29:15,160
-What vinegar?
-Vinegar…

411
00:29:15,270 --> 00:29:18,470
Who said the Divine Fire Villa doesn't have good wine?

412
00:29:18,750 --> 00:29:20,380
Who said that?

413
00:29:20,920 --> 00:29:21,680
I did.

414
00:29:21,680 --> 00:29:22,920
Throw him out!

415
00:29:23,460 --> 00:29:24,070
Out?

416
00:29:24,070 --> 00:29:25,790
My bro and I haven't had enough yet.

417
00:29:25,790 --> 00:29:27,200
Not enough.

418
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:28,350
Bring more wine.

419
00:29:29,830 --> 00:29:31,230
We've got plenty of wine.

420
00:29:31,510 --> 00:29:32,510
I'll have Huaizhu bring it for you!

421
00:29:32,510 --> 00:29:33,440
Bring… Bring it.

422
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:34,160
Huaizhu,

423
00:29:34,160 --> 00:29:34,790
go get some wine.

424
00:29:34,790 --> 00:29:35,780
Go get it now.

425
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:37,270
Someone!

426
00:29:37,510 --> 00:29:38,310
Miss Huaizhu.

427
00:29:38,310 --> 00:29:40,240
Bring them another pot of vinegar.

428
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:41,680
Let them sober up properly.

429
00:29:41,680 --> 00:29:42,310
Yes.

430
00:29:42,350 --> 00:29:43,510
Come on, bro.

431
00:29:44,510 --> 00:29:45,030
I can't drink anymore.

432
00:29:45,030 --> 00:29:46,350
Take it, take it.

433
00:29:46,710 --> 00:29:47,390
Here.

434
00:29:48,070 --> 00:29:49,920
Bro, drink.

435
00:30:10,680 --> 00:30:11,510
You're awake?

436
00:30:20,440 --> 00:30:21,700
Huaizhu, yesterday…

437
00:30:27,160 --> 00:30:27,750
My…

438
00:30:28,490 --> 00:30:29,300
My throat…

439
00:30:32,400 --> 00:30:34,730
Young Master Wangquan not only loves wine

440
00:30:34,790 --> 00:30:36,050
but also vinegar, huh?

441
00:30:38,160 --> 00:30:39,140
Vinegar?

442
00:30:39,350 --> 00:30:40,480
You don't remember?

443
00:30:41,070 --> 00:30:43,760
Then let me remind you.

444
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:47,540
Besides rattling off dish names all night,

445
00:30:47,680 --> 00:30:50,340
you also said
my father's cooking was too bland.

446
00:30:51,480 --> 00:30:54,090
You even became sworn brothers with him.

447
00:30:54,640 --> 00:30:56,400
So now I should call you—

448
00:30:58,190 --> 00:30:59,050
That's enough.

449
00:31:00,590 --> 00:31:01,510
That's enough.

450
00:31:08,510 --> 00:31:10,840
Drink this hangover soup and then go back.

451
00:31:18,030 --> 00:31:19,510
You're not angry, are you?

452
00:31:19,640 --> 00:31:20,830
Vinegar isn't expensive.

453
00:31:20,830 --> 00:31:21,960
Why would I be angry?

454
00:31:22,990 --> 00:31:25,440
Besides, you slept well last night.

455
00:31:25,830 --> 00:31:28,030
Your inner energy has also stabilized.

456
00:31:28,400 --> 00:31:29,210
Then…

457
00:31:30,160 --> 00:31:32,760
Don't you have
important matters to attend to?

458
00:31:41,310 --> 00:31:43,830
Take two of these pills a day.

459
00:31:44,030 --> 00:31:45,510
They're enough for seven days.

460
00:31:45,510 --> 00:31:46,680
After seven days…

461
00:31:47,350 --> 00:31:48,950
I'll come to get more myself.

462
00:31:54,800 --> 00:31:57,310
Huaizhu, Young Master Wangquan and the others have left?

463
00:31:57,310 --> 00:31:58,310
They've all left.

464
00:31:58,760 --> 00:32:01,110
Great! Peace and quiet at last.

465
00:32:01,160 --> 00:32:02,030
I thought

466
00:32:02,030 --> 00:32:04,490
they'd stick around and keep pestering you.

467
00:32:05,160 --> 00:32:07,070
They have important matters to attend to.

468
00:32:07,070 --> 00:32:09,350
Why? You seem to dislike him.

469
00:32:09,920 --> 00:32:11,550
It's not that I dislike him.

470
00:32:11,750 --> 00:32:13,920
I just prefer the masked guy.

471
00:32:15,260 --> 00:32:16,210
Got that?

472
00:32:16,400 --> 00:32:18,790
Where are you going to collect herbs today?

473
00:32:18,790 --> 00:32:19,640
Miss Huaizhu,

474
00:32:19,790 --> 00:32:21,790
we are going to Mount Cangyun today.

475
00:32:30,510 --> 00:32:31,550
What's wrong?

476
00:32:34,310 --> 00:32:36,350
Mount Cangyun is full of steep cliffs.

477
00:32:36,350 --> 00:32:37,590
They're going to collect herbs

478
00:32:37,590 --> 00:32:39,590
but didn't bring any climbing gear.

479
00:32:40,790 --> 00:32:41,880
Now that you mention it,

480
00:32:41,880 --> 00:32:43,400
it does seem a bit odd.

481
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:45,650
Qinlan,

482
00:32:46,310 --> 00:32:47,750
while I was away,

483
00:32:48,110 --> 00:32:50,310
did the rare herbs collected in the villa

484
00:32:50,310 --> 00:32:51,800
actually increase?

485
00:32:52,550 --> 00:32:55,350
Our income
has increased quite a bit because of it.

486
00:32:59,070 --> 00:32:59,960
Strange.

487
00:33:00,350 --> 00:33:02,070
Qinlan, go gather all the disciples.

488
00:33:02,070 --> 00:33:02,790
I need to ask them something.

489
00:33:02,790 --> 00:33:03,310
Okay.

490
00:33:04,110 --> 00:33:06,170
This Wangquan Sword is newly forged.

491
00:33:06,680 --> 00:33:08,540
Young Master, please take a look.

492
00:33:10,440 --> 00:33:13,070
What a pity. A fake is still a fake.

493
00:33:13,160 --> 00:33:15,880
It'll never become
the true greatest sword in the world.

494
00:33:15,880 --> 00:33:16,550
Mr. Fei.

495
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:18,930
Do you remember the dream I had?

496
00:33:19,290 --> 00:33:21,440
The so-called Eternal Night
is actually the Black Fox.

497
00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:24,240
My father must have discovered something
beyond the Boundary,

498
00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:25,300
but he can't return

499
00:33:25,550 --> 00:33:26,880
and has to bide his time.

500
00:33:27,790 --> 00:33:29,190
Young Master, do you mean

501
00:33:30,070 --> 00:33:32,000
you want to go beyond the Boundary?

502
00:33:32,070 --> 00:33:33,270
Don't worry, Mr. Fei.

503
00:33:33,920 --> 00:33:35,260
The battle at Sky City

504
00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:37,160
has shown me the power of the Black Fox.

505
00:33:37,160 --> 00:33:38,490
I won't act recklessly.

506
00:33:39,270 --> 00:33:41,750
I'll definitely find the Black Fox's weakness,

507
00:33:41,750 --> 00:33:42,750
find my father,

508
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:45,130
and claim the true Wangquan Sword.

[Great Virtue Carries All Things]

Thousand-year-old ginseng,
Dendrobium officinale, and Clubmoss

511
00:33:53,590 --> 00:33:54,920
are all worth a fortune.

512
00:33:55,160 --> 00:33:57,400
These herbs grow on steep cliffs.

513
00:33:58,030 --> 00:33:59,590
How did you gather them?

514
00:34:00,570 --> 00:34:01,490
Naturally,

515
00:34:02,040 --> 00:34:04,550
we climbed up there
and picked them ourselves.

00:34:04,550 --> 00:34:07,000
Show me your hands.

517
00:34:13,639 --> 00:34:17,159
It's inevitable to get scratched
gathering herbs on a mountain,

518
00:34:17,159 --> 00:34:19,270
but your hands and feet
don't have any scratches,

Tell me,

521
00:34:22,070 --> 00:34:24,600
how did you obtain these herbs?

522
00:34:25,190 --> 00:34:27,670
That's right. Confess now.

You've enslaved demons to gather herbs.

That's strictly forbidden
by the Divine Fire Villa.

Do you admit your fault?

528
00:34:47,480 --> 00:34:50,860
Master, it's the survival of the fittest.

529
00:34:51,170 --> 00:34:52,719
I've merely enslaved a few demons

530
