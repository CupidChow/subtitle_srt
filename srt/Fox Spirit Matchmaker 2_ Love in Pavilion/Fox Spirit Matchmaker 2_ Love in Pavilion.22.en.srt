Why are you running?

9

Please, let me go.

10
00:02:18,180 --> 00:02:19,360
Don't let me go into the illusion.

11
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:20,030
I saw it.

into the illusion died horribly.

Tonight is my first night

It's also
when my demonic nature is at its peak.

24

By all logic,
I shouldn't be able to control myself.

25

I indeed spent last night
in your sister's room.

00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:20,070
It was because
my demonic aura suddenly flared up.

91
00:08:20,070 --> 00:08:21,800
I felt so cold and lost control.

92
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:23,190
Huaizhu has a special constitution.

93
00:08:23,190 --> 00:08:25,450
I couldn't stop myself from going to her.

94
00:08:26,270 --> 00:08:29,390
But I swear,
I didn't do anything inappropriate.

95
00:08:31,390 --> 00:08:32,990
You don't have to believe me,

96
00:08:33,289 --> 00:08:36,419
but don't you trust your own sister?

97
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:43,720
I'm warning you—

98
00:08:43,870 --> 00:08:45,510
stay away from Huaizhu.

99
00:08:45,870 --> 00:08:47,870
She's way out of your league.

100
00:08:48,460 --> 00:08:49,630
Hold your brother.

101
00:09:00,870 --> 00:09:02,600
Miss Qingmu told me to bring you

102

105
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:12,910
Huaizhu,

106
00:09:13,630 --> 00:09:16,150
why are you so nice
to Young Master Wangquan?

107
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:19,910
Last night,
he was affected by the demonic nature.

108
00:09:19,910 --> 00:09:21,870
He didn't cross any lines.

109
00:09:22,550 --> 00:09:24,510
Why didn't he go to Li Quzhuo?

110
00:09:24,670 --> 00:09:26,800
Wouldn't holding a mongrel be warmer?

111
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:30,000
He clearly came to you on purpose.

112
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:32,790
You have a point.

113
00:09:32,810 --> 00:09:34,790
See? I told you.

114
00:09:34,910 --> 00:09:37,570
You never really know
what's in someone's mind.

115
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:43,150
Huaizhu, you can't trust him so easily.

116
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:44,000
We can't

117
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,750
be fooled by his sweet talk.

118
00:09:46,030 --> 00:09:46,790

124

128
00:10:30,910 --> 00:10:33,170
is spending huge sums on the black market

129
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:34,790
to buy powerful demons.

130
00:10:34,910 --> 00:10:36,840
When does the black market open?

131
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:38,640
Yuan is already investigating.

138
00:11:01,550 --> 00:11:02,450
I want pork wontons.

139
00:11:02,450 --> 00:11:03,780
Alright, this way, sir.

140
00:11:19,100 --> 00:11:20,960
Didn't you just say you were hungry?

141
00:11:20,960 --> 00:11:22,680
Miss, take a look at this.

142
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:23,900
Let's get going.

143
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:25,330
Come, take a look.

144
00:11:25,390 --> 00:11:26,520
Sturdy and durable.

145
00:11:41,070 --> 00:11:42,900
Qingmu Yuan, you fool,

146
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:45,780
why do you have to
put yourself through this?

147
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:54,890
He hasn't come anyway.

148
00:11:56,150 --> 00:11:57,440
I'll take a nap first.

149
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:14,490
What is it?

150
00:12:19,780 --> 00:12:21,280
It's the last one. Take it.

151
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:26,320
Eat it while it's hot and tasty.

152
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:27,450
It'll get cold soon.

153
00:12:27,540 --> 00:12:28,780
It's the last one?

154
00:12:28,870 --> 00:12:30,440
Why aren't you eating it?

155
00:12:31,390 --> 00:12:32,520
If it's the last one,

156
00:12:32,670 --> 00:12:34,030
and I fight a girl for it,

157
00:12:34,390 --> 00:12:35,850
my mom would break my legs.

158
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:38,630
Good upbringing.

159
00:12:38,630 --> 00:12:39,360
Same as mine.

160
00:12:42,670 --> 00:12:44,000
Can I ask you something?

161
00:12:44,840 --> 00:12:47,240
Why do you dislike Hongye so much?

162
00:12:52,840 --> 00:12:54,790
I don't exactly dislike him.

163
00:12:55,270 --> 00:12:56,270
It's just that...

164
00:12:56,270 --> 00:12:58,130
I already have a brother-in-law.

165
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:00,390
He's the Mask Group Leader.

166
00:13:01,460 --> 00:13:03,240
So, for the sake of the masked sir,

167
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:04,700
I need to protect Huaizhu.

168
00:13:05,110 --> 00:13:07,080
The… The Mask Group...

169
00:13:07,750 --> 00:13:09,150
Hong… Hongye…

170
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:10,000
You...

171
00:13:10,990 --> 00:13:12,750
Is there something wrong with your eyes?

172
00:13:12,750 --> 00:13:14,680
Something's wrong with your eyes!

173
00:13:21,550 --> 00:13:22,680
Let me ask you again.

174
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:27,000
What's so bad about Hongye

175
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:28,960
compared to that masked guy?

176
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:34,510
Young Master Wangquan

177
00:13:34,750 --> 00:13:36,270
is not a bad guy, actually.

178
00:13:36,840 --> 00:13:37,720
However,

179
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:41,030
the Wangquan Manor
carries too much responsibility.

180
00:13:41,030 --> 00:13:44,390
Huaizhu is already exhausted
from managing the Divine Fire Villa.

181
00:13:44,390 --> 00:13:47,490
So only the carefree masked swordsman

182
00:13:47,550 --> 00:13:49,410
can give Huaizhu a carefree life.

183
00:13:50,430 --> 00:13:51,610
Your brain is messed up too.

184
00:13:51,610 --> 00:13:53,840
You're a total mess yourself!

185
00:13:54,440 --> 00:13:56,080

191

Let me show you a magic trick.

192
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:20,080
Go ahead.

193
00:14:33,630 --> 00:14:34,360
Take a guess.

194
00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:37,240

195
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:43,670
Meow meow.

What are your plans for today?

198
00:15:04,910 --> 00:15:08,030
I've arranged
a free clinic with the pharmacy owner.

199
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,120
You need to gather more intel?

200
00:15:12,510 --> 00:15:13,270
Yes.

201
00:15:14,120 --> 00:15:16,120
What about you? What are your plans?

202
00:15:17,320 --> 00:15:18,790
During the day,
I'll keep working on my demonic techniques

203
00:15:18,790 --> 00:15:20,790
and see if I can unlock anything new.

204
00:15:21,270 --> 00:15:24,610
Then at dusk,
I'll pick you up from the pharmacy.

205
00:15:25,390 --> 00:15:28,630
Tonight, we'll go stargazing in the desert.

206
00:15:28,910 --> 00:15:29,840

207
00:15:29,870 --> 00:15:30,670
Don't worry.

00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:32,010
Then I'll bring you more in the future.

231
00:17:44,010 --> 00:17:46,140

you don't need to meet her at the market.

284
00:22:03,960 --> 00:22:06,290

You look exactly like

They bought you to be his body double.

Don't you know the fate of a body double?

291
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:35,590
Weren't you afraid I'd die in the Zhang family?

292
00:22:35,590 --> 00:22:36,920
But you didn't die.

293

403
00:28:06,400 --> 00:28:08,260

404
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:10,810
Didn't you two go out to handle something?

406
00:28:13,920 --> 00:28:14,640

410
00:28:24,830 --> 00:28:26,680
him to go stargazing with you.

411
00:28:27,920 --> 00:28:29,980
I didn't expect him to be so stubborn.

412
00:28:30,550 --> 00:28:33,590
If you didn't show up,
he should've just come back.

413
00:28:34,830 --> 00:28:37,070
Oh no, it's much colder at night.

414
00:28:37,070 --> 00:28:38,600

By the way, Hongye,

509
00:33:52,590 --> 00:33:54,750
to prevent this from happening again,

510
00:33:56,110 --> 00:33:57,910
I put an eavesdropping talisman

511
00:33:59,030 --> 00:34:00,290
on Qinlan.

512
00:34:01,160 --> 00:34:02,290
You're ridiculous.

513
00:34:05,880 --> 00:34:08,250
We've found a way
to sneak into the Drunken Dream Tower.

514
00:34:08,250 --> 00:34:10,650
Tomorrow, Hongye and I will go check it out.

Huaizhu,

518
00:34:19,360 --> 00:34:22,090
don't tell me
you've really had a change of heart.

519
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:25,400
I haven't.

520
00:34:26,230 --> 00:34:27,830
You'll understand someday.

521
00:34:30,230 --> 00:34:32,630
Anyway, I think the masked sir is better—

522
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:35,730
1,000 times better than that annoying young master!

523
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:37,510
Masked sir this,

524
00:34:37,510 --> 00:34:38,710
masked sir that.

525
00:34:39,070 --> 00:34:40,110
She's blind!

526
00:34:40,960 --> 00:34:41,710
Hongye,

527
00:34:42,150 --> 00:34:43,550
how about I rush out right now

528
00:34:43,550 --> 00:34:44,840
and tell Qinlan

529
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:46,400
that you're the Mask Group Leader?

530
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:47,110
No.

531
00:34:47,920 --> 00:34:51,320
The Mask Group
is considered heretical in the Yiqi Alliance.

532
00:34:52,960 --> 00:34:54,590
So, do you plan…

533
00:34:56,760 --> 00:34:58,290
to win her over with virtue?

534
00:34:59,110 --> 00:35:01,760
I just don't like that annoying young master!

535
00:35:10,280 --> 00:35:11,670
Actually,

536
00:35:12,630 --> 00:35:14,000
he's not a bad guy.

537
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:16,000
Kinda interesting.

538
00:35:16,190 --> 00:35:17,920
What's interesting about him?

539
00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:21,280
He has a bad temper

540
00:35:21,320 --> 00:35:22,760
and is moody.

541
00:35:22,920 --> 00:35:24,030
He's just

542
00:35:24,550 --> 00:35:28,210
smooth and calm
in handling matters and not fussing over trifles.

543
00:35:29,260 --> 00:35:30,880
But he's also ruthless

544
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:32,070
and cold-blooded.

545
00:35:32,670 --> 00:35:35,320
He's just ruling
with both kindness and authority.

546
00:35:35,320 --> 00:35:37,720
He's cold on the outside but warm-hearted.

547
00:35:40,230 --> 00:35:41,440
Huaizhu,

548
00:35:42,710 --> 00:35:45,640
are we talking about the same Young Master Wangquan?

549
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:46,920
I think so.

550
00:35:49,400 --> 00:35:50,390
You're serious?

551
00:35:50,670 --> 00:35:51,510
Yes.

552
00:35:54,440 --> 00:35:56,800
Then is the Mask Group Leader your first love

553
00:35:56,800 --> 00:35:57,920
or your true love?

554
00:35:58,780 --> 00:36:01,860
If my first love is my true love,

555
00:36:02,110 --> 00:36:03,440
wouldn't it be perfect?

556
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:05,960
Huaizhu,

557
00:36:06,150 --> 00:36:08,630
you're basically two-timing now.

558
00:36:09,550 --> 00:36:10,840
My silly sister,

559
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:11,920
if you don't go get the soup soon,

560
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:12,800
it'll get cold.

561
00:36:13,190 --> 00:36:14,510
Let it get cold.

562
00:36:14,630 --> 00:36:16,430
I'll make sure he drinks it cold.

563
00:36:28,880 --> 00:36:30,110
I can smell the mutton soup.

564
00:36:30,110 --> 00:36:31,310
They'll be here soon.

565
00:36:33,960 --> 00:36:34,840
So,

566
00:36:36,860 --> 00:36:37,990
I'm that great, huh?

567
00:36:41,920 --> 00:36:44,190
Tone it down. You're grinning ear to ear.

568
00:36:47,880 --> 00:36:49,010
I'll go get the soup.

569
00:37:08,080 --> 00:37:15,150
[Drunken Dream Tower]

570
00:38:37,920 --> 00:38:38,710
Master.

571
00:38:39,800 --> 00:38:40,710
Master.

572
00:38:44,610 --> 00:38:45,670
-Master.
-Master.

573
00:38:47,070 --> 00:38:48,000
Master, look.

574
00:38:48,590 --> 00:38:49,550
For that flower,

575
00:38:49,570 --> 00:38:51,520
we've lost a lot of our people.

576
00:38:51,800 --> 00:38:53,330
Then start the Demon Fight.

577
00:38:53,670 --> 00:38:55,470
Bring in new blood from outside.

578
00:38:56,070 --> 00:38:57,070
No matter what,

579
00:38:57,550 --> 00:38:59,010
I must get the Twilight Mist Flower.

580
00:38:59,010 --> 00:39:00,100
Yes, Master.

581
00:39:00,840 --> 00:39:03,490
I told you to find Wangquan Hongye.

582
00:39:03,630 --> 00:39:05,550
Why is there still no news?
