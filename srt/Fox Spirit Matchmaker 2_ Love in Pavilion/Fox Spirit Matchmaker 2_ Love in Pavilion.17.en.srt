[Episode 17]

3
00:01:57,920 --> 00:01:58,890
Huaizhu...

4
00:02:00,430 --> 00:02:01,230
is back.

5
00:02:28,810 --> 00:02:30,590
Dongfang Huaizhu.

6
00:02:31,350 --> 00:02:32,430
Jiuhuo,

7
00:02:33,420 --> 00:02:37,220
I'm not born for the Black Fox.

8
00:02:38,020 --> 00:02:40,350
You'll regret bringing me to the Sky City.

9
00:02:41,910 --> 00:02:43,520
What are you going to do?

10
00:03:25,260 --> 00:03:27,079
Pure Yang Flames...

11
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:30,280
Dongfang Huaizhu!

12
00:03:31,700 --> 00:03:32,850
Jiuhuo,

13
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:37,910
you are defeated.

14
00:03:52,890 --> 00:03:54,490
Hongye, you finally woke up.

15
00:03:58,079 --> 00:03:59,100
Where is Huaizhu?

16
00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:01,900
Where is Huaizhu?

17
00:04:08,190 --> 00:04:09,400
Where is Huaizhu?

18
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:13,160
Where is Huaizhu?

19
00:04:28,890 --> 00:04:30,100
Did I lose?

20
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:42,010
It's time to take medicine.

21
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:17,290
Young Master Wangquan, it seems...

22
00:05:42,470 --> 00:05:43,470
Huaizhu,

23
00:05:46,310 --> 00:05:47,520
is that you?

24
00:05:50,210 --> 00:05:51,320
Yes, it's me,

25
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:01,100
Dongfang Huaizhu.

26
00:06:07,750 --> 00:06:08,550
Hongye,

27
00:06:10,420 --> 00:06:12,630
we achieved a landslide victory.

28
00:06:16,430 --> 00:06:17,490
How is Mu Mie doing?

29
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:20,980
He got injured and lost too much spiritual energy.

30
00:06:20,980 --> 00:06:22,660
But he should be fine.

31
00:06:22,690 --> 00:06:24,420
Miss Cuiyu is attending to him.

32
00:06:25,190 --> 00:06:27,750
When Quzhuo fixes the golden lotus,

33
00:06:27,750 --> 00:06:28,800
we can all go home.

34
00:06:29,510 --> 00:06:30,870
Hongye, how will

35
00:06:31,310 --> 00:06:32,800
you deal with Jiuhuo?

36
00:06:38,409 --> 00:06:39,890
Jiuhuo never dies.

37
00:06:41,070 --> 00:06:42,360
He was sealed once.

38
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:45,420
We'll take him back to 20 years ago

39
00:06:46,310 --> 00:06:47,710
to have him sealed again.

40
00:07:09,890 --> 00:07:11,010
Huaizhu,

41
00:07:11,130 --> 00:07:13,340
I'm leaving Hongye to your care.

42
00:07:15,460 --> 00:07:17,070
Come on, Quzhuo.

43
00:07:17,070 --> 00:07:18,430
Do you fancy some fresh air?

44
00:07:18,430 --> 00:07:20,120
Come on. Let's go.

45
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:31,740
Give me your hand.

46
00:07:38,150 --> 00:07:40,100
It is a bit cold.

47
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,050
Warm it up then.

48
00:08:00,470 --> 00:08:01,800
Are you feeling better?

49
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:08,360
These battles have

50
00:08:09,170 --> 00:08:11,090
given you severe injuries.

51
00:08:11,430 --> 00:08:13,870
You need attentive medical care back home.

52
00:08:18,670 --> 00:08:19,480
Huaizhu,

53
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:21,410
I realized two things

54
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,560
in this fierce battle.

55
00:08:24,420 --> 00:08:25,380
First,

56
00:08:25,660 --> 00:08:26,890
I owe you an apology.

57
00:08:27,060 --> 00:08:28,840
I'm sorry I didn't tell you

58
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:32,669
my other identity, though I didn't mean to hide it.

59
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:34,510
I was waiting for the right moment

60
00:08:34,510 --> 00:08:35,789
to reveal it.

61
00:08:39,669 --> 00:08:40,720
Second,

62
00:08:43,179 --> 00:08:44,700
I don't want to cancel

63
00:08:45,510 --> 00:08:46,840
our meeting on July 7th.

64
00:08:49,900 --> 00:08:51,450
At the Yang family's residence,

65
00:08:51,450 --> 00:08:54,020
I already bade farewell to you.

66
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:56,190
Young Master Wangquan,

67
00:08:57,230 --> 00:08:58,350
please stop here.

68
00:09:00,380 --> 00:09:02,690
I won't see you at the Bamboo Pavilion by River Huai

69
00:09:02,690 --> 00:09:04,220
on July 7th!

70
00:09:07,030 --> 00:09:08,110
Are you saying

71
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,270
that you only want to

72
00:09:10,410 --> 00:09:13,060
meet me once in a year

73
00:09:13,090 --> 00:09:14,130
on July 7th?

74
00:09:14,150 --> 00:09:15,190
Of course not.

75
00:09:21,980 --> 00:09:23,180
So you're teasing me.

76
00:09:32,820 --> 00:09:33,880
Take the medicine.

77
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:43,740
Inside of me,

78
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:45,600
some of the Black Fox's energy

79
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:47,460
and soul fragments still remain.

80
00:09:47,820 --> 00:09:50,140
She was brutal and resourceful.

81
00:09:51,060 --> 00:09:52,660
If she had left the Boundary,

82
00:09:53,150 --> 00:09:54,950
there would've been a disaster.

83
00:10:02,510 --> 00:10:03,840
It's a sleepless night.

84
00:10:04,750 --> 00:10:06,150
Shall we go out for a walk?

85
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:10,510
Let's see what the world is like after 20 years.

86
00:10:37,940 --> 00:10:40,150
I didn't expect this street to be so bustling

87
00:10:40,150 --> 00:10:43,280
because humans and demons are making prayers together.

88
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:46,320
Humans and demons

89
00:10:46,790 --> 00:10:49,440
share the same aspirations.

90
00:11:15,750 --> 00:11:17,270
They are all looking for hope

91
00:11:17,270 --> 00:11:18,330
though in despair.

92
00:11:19,930 --> 00:11:22,260
They wish for a life of joy.

93
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:25,210
Both humans and demons

94
00:11:27,150 --> 00:11:29,480
are making the best of what they're given.

95
00:11:56,920 --> 00:11:58,480
All is finally over.

96
00:12:00,290 --> 00:12:01,990
When Quzhuo fixes the lotus,

97
00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:03,430
we can go home.

98
00:12:04,090 --> 00:12:04,800
Young...

99
00:12:11,180 --> 00:12:12,070
Hongye,

100
00:12:15,960 --> 00:12:17,580
I have a question.

101
00:12:19,220 --> 00:12:20,370
What made you

102
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:23,510
risk your life to save mine?

103
00:12:25,630 --> 00:12:27,230
I've never thought about it.

104
00:12:27,790 --> 00:12:31,510
What if the war had ended worse than you expected?

105
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:36,500
I haven't thought about that either.

106
00:12:37,160 --> 00:12:39,020
Then what have you thought about?

107
00:12:39,190 --> 00:12:40,520

What beautiful scenery.

135
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:20,120
The perfect time to drink, isn't it?

136
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:22,750
You know me well, Yitan.

137
00:14:33,910 --> 00:14:34,910
Yitan,

138
00:14:34,910 --> 00:14:37,120
are we sharing a kiss

139
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:38,800
by doing so?

140
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:44,540
Are you okay?

141
00:14:45,010 --> 00:14:46,800
I-I-I'm fine.

142
00:14:49,630 --> 00:14:52,370
Don't we usually drink like this?

143
00:14:52,670 --> 00:14:53,660
Really?

144
00:14:53,890 --> 00:14:55,410
How come it feels

145
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:57,670
particularly different to me today?

146
00:14:57,670 --> 00:14:58,930
Let me count the times.

147
00:14:59,330 --> 00:15:01,660
It first happened when we played with mud.

148
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:03,360
The second time was in the Sky-breaking Temple,

149
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:05,690
where we repeatedly did the same thing.

150
00:15:05,960 --> 00:15:07,080
Then when we carried out missions...

151
00:15:07,080 --> 00:15:07,790
Zui.

152
00:15:14,750 --> 00:15:17,440
Yitan, do you remember when we were little,

153
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:20,080
my father held your hand like this

154
00:15:20,080 --> 00:15:21,750
and led you to me, saying

155
00:15:21,750 --> 00:15:23,750
that you would be my future husband?

156
00:15:35,050 --> 00:15:36,580
I remember that, of course.

157
00:15:36,810 --> 00:15:37,980
However,

158
00:15:38,510 --> 00:15:40,850
you secretly drank some home-brew rice wine

159
00:15:40,850 --> 00:15:42,590
that day and caused a scene.

160
00:15:42,710 --> 00:15:45,540
You chased, cursed and bit me.

161
00:15:45,570 --> 00:15:47,570
You also firmly refused to marry me.

162
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,860
Silly childhood stuff, isn't it?

163
00:15:52,030 --> 00:15:53,120
Yitan,

164
00:15:53,750 --> 00:15:55,150
you always treat me well

165
00:15:55,720 --> 00:15:57,870
and give me a strong sense of security.

166
00:15:58,910 --> 00:15:59,870
Sometimes...

167
00:16:01,670 --> 00:16:03,630
It makes me wonder.

168
00:16:06,030 --> 00:16:07,320
About what?

169
00:16:08,090 --> 00:16:09,620
Do you love me?

170
00:16:24,910 --> 00:16:26,330
I certainly love you.

171
00:16:28,810 --> 00:16:30,670
Because you're my little sister!

172
00:17:22,109 --> 00:17:24,640
Quzhuo, why did you ask for a meeting?

173
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:28,730
No reason.

174
00:17:30,070 --> 00:17:33,200
I just wanted to see you again

175
00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:35,760
after such a long time.

176
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:40,400
You're bad at hiding your thoughts.

177
00:17:41,240 --> 00:17:42,440
Just speak your mind.

178
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:55,030
I think...

179
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:00,330
You're entitled

180
00:18:02,590 --> 00:18:04,450
to be informed of certain things.

of keeping all the letters.

191
00:18:45,250 --> 00:18:46,910
But there aren't many of them.

192
00:18:47,830 --> 00:18:48,640
Because

193
00:18:51,780 --> 00:18:54,240
in the 10th year after you left the Boundary,

194
00:18:57,420 --> 00:18:58,800
she passed away.

195
00:19:42,750 --> 00:19:43,670
Hongye,

196
00:19:44,370 --> 00:19:46,030
aren't you going to read them?

197
00:19:47,560 --> 00:19:48,350
No.

198
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:52,490
I believe

199
00:19:53,710 --> 00:19:55,200
fate can be changed,

200
00:19:56,820 --> 00:19:58,350
and hope lies in the future.

201
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:02,490
This cannot be the ending of my story

202
00:20:04,820 --> 00:20:06,310
with Dongfang Huaizhu.

203
00:20:32,310 --> 00:20:34,620
You're here to laugh at me.

204
00:20:35,040 --> 00:20:36,040
You already lost.

205
00:20:40,530 --> 00:20:42,330
You know clearly

206
00:20:42,360 --> 00:20:44,820
that the Black Grief Tree won't cease to be,

207
00:20:46,110 --> 00:20:48,610
and that Jia Lan will come back one day,

208
00:20:50,850 --> 00:20:54,380
as long as there are evil thoughts in the world.

209
00:20:54,530 --> 00:20:55,990
I certainly know all that.

210
00:20:56,590 --> 00:20:58,720
Evil thoughts will never be erased,

211
00:20:59,720 --> 00:21:01,120
no matter how hard we try.

212
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:03,590
Are you dreaded?

213
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:11,440
Similarly,

214
00:21:12,410 --> 00:21:14,200
you cannot block out the light.

215
00:21:14,550 --> 00:21:15,790
Just like now,

216
00:21:16,420 --> 00:21:17,510
the swords in our hands

217
00:21:17,510 --> 00:21:19,830
will pierce deeply into your chests,

218
00:21:19,830 --> 00:21:21,270
drowning you in fear.

219
00:21:21,270 --> 00:21:22,590
Even if we collapse,

220
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:25,100
the future generations will know

221
00:21:25,590 --> 00:21:27,190
that you are not invincible.

222
00:21:27,920 --> 00:21:30,830
I believe, as long as there are sword wielders,

223
00:21:31,720 --> 00:21:34,720
the dawn light will eventually illuminate the world.

224
00:21:38,030 --> 00:21:38,880
No, it won't.

225
00:21:39,550 --> 00:21:42,640
I'll kill all the sword wielders before that.

226
00:21:45,110 --> 00:21:45,920
I...

227
00:21:47,310 --> 00:21:49,750
will kill you one day.

228
00:22:04,030 --> 00:22:05,590
Come on, Quzhuo.

229
00:22:06,310 --> 00:22:07,070
It's been long

230
00:22:07,070 --> 00:22:08,640
since we drank so happily.

231
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:09,570
How delightful!

232
00:22:10,070 --> 00:22:11,870
I should be saying that instead.

233
00:22:13,410 --> 00:22:16,140
The drinks I had alone in the Sky-breaking Temple

234
00:22:17,510 --> 00:22:18,510
tasted bitter.

235
00:22:19,920 --> 00:22:20,780
To our reunion.

236
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:24,260
And to our parting.

237
00:22:24,680 --> 00:22:26,070
To our reunion and parting.

238
00:22:26,070 --> 00:22:26,720
Cheers!

239
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:27,660
Cheers.

240
00:22:27,920 --> 00:22:28,380
Cheers.

241
00:22:33,110 --> 00:22:36,830
If you really think about it, Jiuhuo is deeply infatuated.

242
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:39,660
Though love drove him to choose a wrong path,

243
00:22:39,910 --> 00:22:41,510
he's not worthy of sympathy.

244
00:22:42,090 --> 00:22:43,940
You humans are ridiculous.

245
00:22:44,110 --> 00:22:46,110
I don't think he did anything wrong.

246
00:22:46,440 --> 00:22:48,900
As long as my beloved one feels free and happy,

247
00:22:48,900 --> 00:22:51,500
nothing else could bother me.

248
00:22:52,840 --> 00:22:54,160
It's never been easy to decide

249
00:22:54,160 --> 00:22:55,560
between love and morals.

250
00:22:55,750 --> 00:22:57,720
Let's drop the subject.

251
00:22:58,680 --> 00:23:00,860
Yes. In whatever way,

252
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:02,810
he already lost.

253
00:23:02,830 --> 00:23:03,830
Hongye is right.

254
00:23:04,660 --> 00:23:06,040
Let's drink.

255
00:23:06,440 --> 00:23:06,900
Cheers!

256
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:07,460
Cheers!

257
00:23:07,680 --> 00:23:08,140
Cheers!

258
00:23:08,440 --> 00:23:08,830
Cheers!

259
00:23:08,830 --> 00:23:09,290
Cheers!

260
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:09,900
Cheers!

261
00:23:17,170 --> 00:23:18,970
This is your mother's favorite.

262
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:20,030
Try it.

263
00:23:21,330 --> 00:23:23,130
Mom told me a lot about you,

264
00:23:23,160 --> 00:23:24,160
Auntie Huaizhu.

265
00:23:24,740 --> 00:23:27,400
You look just like your mother.

266
00:23:27,710 --> 00:23:28,600
Really?

267
00:23:28,830 --> 00:23:30,030
Come on, Mu Mie.

268
00:23:31,570 --> 00:23:33,430
You haven't fully recovered yet.

269
00:23:33,510 --> 00:23:35,350
I'll drink this on his behalf.

270
00:23:38,860 --> 00:23:40,980
Then the next turn will be mine.

271
00:23:49,110 --> 00:23:49,920
In fact,

272
00:23:52,310 --> 00:23:55,790
the golden lotus can be put into use soon.

273
00:23:58,740 --> 00:24:00,410
When it starts working,

274
00:24:02,830 --> 00:24:03,510
you all

275
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:06,240
will be taken home.

276
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:10,070
I'll be left alone here again.

277
00:24:14,510 --> 00:24:15,590
Quzhuo,

278
00:24:17,460 --> 00:24:18,900
didn't we make a promise?

279
00:24:18,920 --> 00:24:21,330
We will change the story,

280
00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:22,720
and we'll all stay alive.

281
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:25,350
The Sky-breaking Temple won't be dull and quiet.

282
00:24:25,350 --> 00:24:27,120
There won't be misery either.

283
00:24:27,750 --> 00:24:29,720
Where there is a will...

284
00:24:32,330 --> 00:24:35,110
There is a way!

285
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:36,750
Very good.

286
00:24:36,770 --> 00:24:38,570
The mischievous Quzhuo is back.

287
00:24:42,070 --> 00:24:42,880
Come on.

288
00:24:44,780 --> 00:24:46,640
To the two decade-ago Mask Group.

289
00:24:48,030 --> 00:24:50,160
To the two decade-later version of us.

290
00:24:50,250 --> 00:24:52,810
All the sorrows and pain

291
00:24:53,060 --> 00:24:54,190
will go away.

292
00:24:54,850 --> 00:24:55,570
Cheers.

293
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:56,700
-Cheers!
-Cheers.

294
00:24:56,700 --> 00:24:57,110
Cheers.

295
00:24:57,110 --> 00:24:57,590
Cheers.

296
00:25:06,810 --> 00:25:07,330
Mu Mie!

297
00:25:37,130 --> 00:25:38,000
Miss Huaizhu,

298
00:25:38,030 --> 00:25:39,160
how is my brother?

299
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:44,620
His organs are all shattered.

300
00:25:44,850 --> 00:25:46,050
So are his meridians.

301
00:25:47,320 --> 00:25:49,780
It resulted from the battle against Jiuhuo.

302
00:25:53,110 --> 00:25:54,310
That's impossible.

303
00:25:54,620 --> 00:25:56,070
He was fine just now.

304
00:25:56,070 --> 00:25:58,030
He said he had a minor stomachache,

305
00:25:58,030 --> 00:25:59,400
and that he was alright.

306
00:26:00,310 --> 00:26:03,400
Just like Mu Xiaowu,

307
00:26:04,680 --> 00:26:06,280
he withheld all the bad news.

308
00:26:06,570 --> 00:26:07,750
Is there a cure for him?

309
00:26:07,750 --> 00:26:10,210
Yeah. What medicine is needed?

310
00:26:10,830 --> 00:26:11,880
I'll try to get it.

311
00:26:16,680 --> 00:26:17,630
Miss Cuiyu,

312
00:26:18,110 --> 00:26:20,710
the Leech Clan is known for its medical skills.

313
00:26:21,400 --> 00:26:23,400
I can't think of a solution now.

314
00:26:24,030 --> 00:26:26,440
Will you please save his life?

315
00:26:31,720 --> 00:26:33,270
Prepare a room for me.

316
00:26:34,830 --> 00:26:36,230
Do not disturb me and him.

317
00:26:48,110 --> 00:26:50,240
I already failed to protect Mu Xiaowu.

318
00:26:52,590 --> 00:26:53,370
Now,

319
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:56,780
will I also fail to protect Yan's son?

320
00:27:14,310 --> 00:27:15,070
Huaizhu,

321
00:27:15,680 --> 00:27:16,440
Yitan,

322
00:27:16,920 --> 00:27:18,380
don't beat yourselves up.

323
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:20,070
We have all seen

324
00:27:20,070 --> 00:27:22,590
what Miss Cuiyu is capable of.

325
00:27:22,590 --> 00:27:25,030
Now, all we can do is wait.

326
00:27:55,240 --> 00:27:56,680
Miss Cuiyu.

327
00:28:12,790 --> 00:28:14,720
You know I'm unable to heal wounds.

328
00:28:16,070 --> 00:28:19,830
I can't perform any sort of demonic magic.

329
00:28:22,850 --> 00:28:23,820
Blue Eyes,

330
00:28:24,050 --> 00:28:25,570
come out now.

331
00:28:32,030 --> 00:28:33,090
Come out right now!

332
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:35,240
Blue Eyes, I know you're here.

333
00:28:35,240 --> 00:28:36,310
Show up!

334
00:28:36,830 --> 00:28:39,030
Dummy will die without your help.

335
00:28:39,030 --> 00:28:39,790
He will die!

336
00:28:39,790 --> 00:28:41,000
Do you know that?

337
00:28:57,110 --> 00:28:58,170
What are you doing?

338
00:29:01,030 --> 00:29:02,920
It's high time you repaid me.

339
00:29:06,310 --> 00:29:08,320
You'll fall into eternal sleep

340
00:29:08,370 --> 00:29:10,050
and never wake up.

341
00:29:16,600 --> 00:29:17,790
We've been sharing

342
00:29:18,200 --> 00:29:20,150
one body over all this time.

343
00:29:21,880 --> 00:29:23,880
I've cast a spell on Blue Eyes

344
00:29:23,960 --> 00:29:26,160
and taken sole possession of this body.

345
00:29:27,510 --> 00:29:29,040
I can't wake her up anymore.

346
00:29:32,080 --> 00:29:34,330
If she is to come to,

347
00:29:35,110 --> 00:29:36,720
I'll have to disappear

348
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:39,040
and give the body back to her.

349
00:29:40,200 --> 00:29:41,350
Only in this way

350
00:29:41,920 --> 00:29:43,400
can I save Dummy's life.

351
00:29:46,110 --> 00:29:48,960
Blue Eyes is the only one you love.

352
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:52,400
I just stole her position, didn't I?

353
00:29:57,550 --> 00:29:58,960
Dummy,

354
00:29:59,550 --> 00:30:01,070
when did I

355
00:30:01,070 --> 00:30:02,640
fall in love with you?

356
00:30:07,920 --> 00:30:08,720
Perhaps

357
00:30:12,340 --> 00:30:15,230
it all started when I gave you wrong directions

358
00:30:15,890 --> 00:30:17,750
as you asked me like a little fool.

359
00:30:22,870 --> 00:30:25,140
What do I see in you, Dummy?

360
00:30:26,850 --> 00:30:29,120
You're silly and goofy.

361
00:30:34,040 --> 00:30:36,650
But I can't control my feelings for you.

362
00:30:39,160 --> 00:30:41,510
When I see you talking to another girl,

363
00:30:42,270 --> 00:30:43,400
I'd get mad.

364
00:30:44,800 --> 00:30:47,760
I want to yell at you every time your face appears.

365
00:30:51,920 --> 00:30:54,240
But why can't you understand

366
00:30:56,110 --> 00:30:57,200
that I yell at you

367
00:30:59,950 --> 00:31:02,690
only to hear you talk back to me?

368
00:31:05,110 --> 00:31:06,030
Dummy,

369
00:31:08,030 --> 00:31:08,920
I know

370
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:12,240
I'm bossy and pushy.

371
00:31:13,030 --> 00:31:14,990
Sometimes, I'm a loose cannon.

372
00:31:18,550 --> 00:31:20,240
If I force you to be with me,

373
00:31:21,790 --> 00:31:23,510
you'll be upset, right?

374
00:31:33,750 --> 00:31:34,550
So,

375
00:31:35,960 --> 00:31:37,030
I have to leave.

376
00:31:38,310 --> 00:31:39,030
From now on,

377
00:31:40,360 --> 00:31:42,960
Blue Eyes, who you love, will keep you company,

378
00:31:43,750 --> 00:31:44,590
