00:01:40,770 --> 00:01:45,780
[Love in Pavilion]

2
00:01:46,310 --> 00:01:50,680
[Episode 11]

3
00:01:59,460 --> 00:02:00,690
How are you, Hongye?

4
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:03,430
Much better.

5
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:06,650
Why do you think Huaizhu

6
00:02:06,710 --> 00:02:08,520
has become like this?

7
00:02:08,860 --> 00:02:11,580
Is the City Lord

8
00:02:11,610 --> 00:02:12,540
they mentioned

9
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:14,770
the great demon who abducted Huaizhu?

10
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:16,960
Why did he

11
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:18,630
bring Huaizhu here?

12
00:02:19,250 --> 00:02:21,180
I want to know all these things too.

13
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:23,460
That's why when I fought with her,

14
00:02:23,610 --> 00:02:24,640
I placed

15
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,930
an eavesdropping talisman on her.

16
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,520
The person you love

17
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:36,000
doesn't recognize you and has turned into a demoness.

18
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,280
Under such emotional stress,

19
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:40,410
you were still able to place an eavesdropping talisman?

20
00:02:57,290 --> 00:02:58,050
My Lord.

21
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:00,190
Leave.

22
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:03,150
I am tired.

23
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,800
Lord Jiuhuo must be hiding something from me.

24
00:03:09,310 --> 00:03:10,770
You are Dongfang Huaizhu,

25
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:12,490
not some Guardian.

26
00:03:12,510 --> 00:03:13,770
If you don't remember,

27
00:03:14,140 --> 00:03:15,400
I will help you recall.

28
00:03:16,710 --> 00:03:20,030
Who is this Dongfang Huaizhu he mentioned?

29
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,430
Lord Jiuhuo.

30
00:03:38,030 --> 00:03:39,310
You've become

31
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:42,120
more fond of beauty than before.

32
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:43,520
I never expected

33
00:03:43,910 --> 00:03:46,650
that you would comb someone's hair.

34
00:03:46,670 --> 00:03:49,660
When you were little, you were even wilder.

35
00:03:49,970 --> 00:03:51,960
Every time I fixed your hair,

36
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:54,120
you'd mess it up in no time.

37
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:55,710
At that time, I

38
00:03:55,870 --> 00:03:58,000
really wanted to shave your head bald.

39
00:03:59,870 --> 00:04:01,800
Are you really

40
00:04:02,190 --> 00:04:03,750
talking about me?

41
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:07,620
You need not doubt.

42
00:04:08,170 --> 00:04:10,520
That mandala flower is the best proof.

43
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:15,120
Today—

44
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:17,190
Today, you did not come to my chamber

45
00:04:17,649 --> 00:04:19,480
and nothing happened.

46
00:04:20,010 --> 00:04:21,410
You only need to remember

47
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:23,810
that I raised you since you were young.

48
00:04:24,470 --> 00:04:25,830
Without my protection,

49
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:29,330
you would have no place among neither humans nor demons.

50
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:32,490
But why

51
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:35,159
can't I remember any of this?

52
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:44,840
While fighting against humans,

53
00:04:45,270 --> 00:04:47,070
your head was severely injured,

54
00:04:47,390 --> 00:04:49,190
causing you to lose your memory.

55
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:53,200
What's wrong?

56
00:04:54,070 --> 00:04:55,270
Do you doubt me?

57
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:57,650
I wouldn't dare.

58
00:05:12,070 --> 00:05:13,430
You left the city today.

59
00:05:13,830 --> 00:05:15,390
Did something happen?

60
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:19,430
I encountered

61
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:22,130
a madman who called himself Wangquan Hongye.

62
00:05:22,270 --> 00:05:23,730
He said he knew me

63
00:05:24,270 --> 00:05:28,250
and that my name was Dongfang Huaizhu.

64
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:34,590
[Eavesdropping talisman, play along]

65
00:05:38,870 --> 00:05:41,000
Wangquan Manor has long since fallen.

66
00:05:41,190 --> 00:05:42,560
There's no such person.

67
00:05:43,510 --> 00:05:44,950
This man is just a fraud.

68
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:47,320
You needn't pay him any mind.

69
00:05:50,070 --> 00:05:52,120
Yes, My Lord.

70
00:05:53,430 --> 00:05:55,070
I have a task for you.

71
00:05:55,510 --> 00:05:57,750
Recently, a powerful great demon has appeared

72
00:05:57,750 --> 00:06:00,190
in the northwest at Lizi Hill.

73
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:03,560
I want you to go and capture it for me.

74
00:06:03,270 --> 00:06:04,770
[Set up a trap to catch him]

75
00:06:06,390 --> 00:06:08,310
When should I depart?

76
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:13,830
Set out early tomorrow.

77
00:06:16,990 --> 00:06:19,200
[Teleport to the barrier after the magical artifact is activated]

78
00:06:24,630 --> 00:06:25,430
Yes.

79
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:38,310
This Jiuhuo

80
00:06:38,510 --> 00:06:40,120
combed Huaizhu's hair?

81
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:45,240
Shouldn't the focus be on how she has a mission tomorrow

82
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:46,190
at Lizi Hill in the northwest

83
00:06:46,190 --> 00:06:47,390
and can't Jiuhuo appear?

84
00:06:47,390 --> 00:06:48,690
He combed her hair.

85
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:50,760
The tone between them is so intimate.

86
00:06:50,760 --> 00:06:52,159
It's only been a few days.

87
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:55,540
Quzhuo said

88
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,800
we arrived only a few hours late,

89
00:06:57,820 --> 00:06:58,720
but a long time

90
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:01,390
should have passed in this place already.

91
00:07:01,390 --> 00:07:03,320
However, judging from their tone,

92
00:07:04,310 --> 00:07:05,600
it really doesn't seem like

93
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:07,450
a relationship that could've been developed in two or three days.

94
00:07:07,450 --> 00:07:08,310
Right?

95
00:07:19,510 --> 00:07:22,710
Something else Jiuhuo just said was also very important.

96
00:07:23,690 --> 00:07:26,550
Wangquan Manor has long since fallen into decline.

97
00:07:28,650 --> 00:07:30,180
Huaizhu also mentioned it.

98
00:07:32,110 --> 00:07:33,770
How will it fall into decline?

99
00:07:34,190 --> 00:07:38,240
Will it be like Divine Fire Villa and Ruyi Pavilion?

100
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:41,720
What about us?

101
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:43,580
What about the Mask Group?

102
00:07:50,390 --> 00:07:51,000
Hongye,

103
00:07:51,750 --> 00:07:53,480
I want to go home and take a look.

104
00:07:53,750 --> 00:07:55,560
Desperate times call for desperate measures.

105
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:56,750
Our primary mission

106
00:07:56,920 --> 00:07:58,850
is to bring Dongfang Huaizhu back.

107
00:08:00,450 --> 00:08:01,540
I'll find a way.

108
00:08:02,190 --> 00:08:05,390
Contact everyone from the Mask Group and Wangquan Manor.

109
00:08:26,530 --> 00:08:27,240
Zui.

110
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:48,150
Plum wine?

111
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:50,050
It's light wine.

112
00:08:51,820 --> 00:08:52,630
Not bad.

113
00:08:53,010 --> 00:08:54,540
You know there's a mission.

114
00:08:54,580 --> 00:08:55,470
Of course.

115
00:08:56,910 --> 00:08:57,770
Where's Yitan?

116
00:08:58,150 --> 00:08:59,850
He went to send messages

117
00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:02,490
and gather some information while he's at it.

118
00:09:02,510 --> 00:09:04,790
Then why didn't you go with him?

119
00:09:18,390 --> 00:09:19,360
Our Zui

120
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:20,550
is afraid?

121
00:09:22,350 --> 00:09:24,390
They all say you're carefree,

122
00:09:25,870 --> 00:09:26,750
but actually,

123
00:09:28,270 --> 00:09:30,270
you understand better than anyone.

124
00:09:31,520 --> 00:09:32,520
Since childhood,

125
00:09:32,870 --> 00:09:34,270
Mother passed away early

126
00:09:34,790 --> 00:09:36,190
and Father went missing.

127
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:39,650
You never asked me about it.

128
00:09:40,870 --> 00:09:42,200
When faced with rumors,

129
00:09:42,860 --> 00:09:44,510
you don't bring it up either.

130
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:46,910
I know

131
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:49,320
you care for me.

132
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,730
You think that as your brother,

133
00:09:53,690 --> 00:09:55,620
I've already shouldered too much.

134
00:09:57,240 --> 00:09:59,150
So if in this world

135
00:10:00,410 --> 00:10:03,070
there was a ranking for the most understanding,

136
00:10:04,390 --> 00:10:05,510
then our Zui

137
00:10:07,550 --> 00:10:09,350
would definitely be number one.

138
00:10:10,750 --> 00:10:11,550
Hongye.

139
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:15,070
I'm truly scared.

140
00:10:15,670 --> 00:10:17,330
I've already lost my parents.

141
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:19,320
I'm afraid of losing you,

142
00:10:19,510 --> 00:10:20,790
losing Mr. Fei,

143
00:10:21,150 --> 00:10:23,280
and losing anyone from the Mask Group.

144
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:33,270
Don't be afraid. I'm here.

145
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,510
I will protect everyone.

146
00:10:37,510 --> 00:10:38,870
I will find our father.

147
00:10:40,330 --> 00:10:41,550
I won't let Zui

148
00:10:42,750 --> 00:10:44,150
lose anyone.

149
00:11:29,510 --> 00:11:30,790
We meet again,

150
00:11:31,390 --> 00:11:33,090
Wangquan Hongye.

151
00:11:36,870 --> 00:11:38,130
Where exactly is this?

152
00:11:38,850 --> 00:11:40,650
What kind of evil creature are you?

153
00:11:40,650 --> 00:11:42,310
I've told you,

154
00:11:42,710 --> 00:11:44,160
I am the Eternal Night.

155
00:11:55,770 --> 00:11:57,680
When the mandala flower appears

156
00:11:58,030 --> 00:12:01,150
is when Dongfang Huaizhu will disappear.

157
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:28,910
Hongye,

158
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:31,520
you had that dream again?

159
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:33,200
Yes.

160
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:35,920
I dreamed of that giant tree.

161
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:38,390
It's getting bigger and bigger.

162
00:12:38,390 --> 00:12:40,120
If your speculation is correct

163
00:12:40,840 --> 00:12:42,510
and this tree feeds on hatred,

164
00:12:43,150 --> 00:12:45,630
then it should indeed be growing larger and larger

165
00:12:45,630 --> 00:12:47,240
because the conflict between humans and demons

166
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:49,100
has reached a devastating level.

167
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:53,440
What about your task?

168
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:54,270
Is it all done?

169
00:12:54,750 --> 00:12:56,150
The news has been spread.

170
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:58,320
I did some brief reconnaissance in the area.

171
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:00,550
This place was originally the capital of the Netherworld Clan.

172
00:13:00,550 --> 00:13:03,390
The City Lord was Ye Yuan, the demon king of the Netherworld Clan.

173
00:13:03,390 --> 00:13:04,790
About four months ago,

174
00:13:05,270 --> 00:13:07,810
a celestial demon suddenly arrived in the city.

175
00:13:07,810 --> 00:13:09,810
He quickly became the new city lord.

176
00:13:10,550 --> 00:13:12,320
That must be Jiuhuo.

177
00:13:12,670 --> 00:13:13,670
Since then,

178
00:13:13,910 --> 00:13:15,910
Sky City began to accept both humans and demons,

179
00:13:15,910 --> 00:13:16,910
and protect them.

180
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:21,100
That's why this small town outside the city gradually prospered.

181
00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:22,330
But why did

182
00:13:23,630 --> 00:13:26,230
Jiuhuo bring Huaizhu to 20 years in the future?

183
00:13:27,150 --> 00:13:28,440
What's his purpose?

184
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:30,630
Well,

185
00:13:31,150 --> 00:13:32,410
that's still unknown.

186
00:13:35,290 --> 00:13:37,310
I am the Eternal Night.

187
00:13:40,740 --> 00:13:41,750
I keep feeling

188
00:13:43,220 --> 00:13:45,350
that he came here for this very reason.

189
00:13:47,900 --> 00:13:48,660
Anyway,

190
00:13:49,410 --> 00:13:51,810
let's deal with the Lizi Hill matter first.

191
00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:52,510
Alright.

192
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:07,400
They're here.

193
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:09,060
Including Miss Dongfang,

194
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:10,450
there are seven people.

195
00:14:12,670 --> 00:14:14,650
[Lizi Hill]

196
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,700
Attack your master.

197
00:14:56,670 --> 00:14:59,200
What exactly are your intentions towards me?

198
00:14:59,240 --> 00:15:00,700
Why are you so persistent?

199
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,390
How could a mere

200
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,630
eavesdropping talisman remain undetected for so long?

201
00:15:05,630 --> 00:15:07,160
Lizi Hill in the northwest.

202
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:09,700
The time and place were given so clearly.

203
00:15:09,750 --> 00:15:11,320
It was obviously a trap.

204
00:15:11,910 --> 00:15:13,790
Then how could your Lord Jiuhuo ensure

205
00:15:13,790 --> 00:15:15,560
that we, who have fallen into the trap,

206
00:15:15,560 --> 00:15:17,160
would certainly be subdued?

207
00:15:17,780 --> 00:15:19,510
There's only one possibility.

208
00:15:19,610 --> 00:15:21,030
He gave you a magical artifact

209
00:15:21,030 --> 00:15:22,600
that can subdue enemies...

210
00:15:28,670 --> 00:15:29,440
in one move.

211
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:33,930
Those who worry too much

212
00:15:34,080 --> 00:15:35,260
are prone to premature aging.

213
00:15:35,260 --> 00:15:37,060
You are so handsome and elegant.

214
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:39,360
Be careful not to get gray hair.

215
00:15:40,450 --> 00:15:41,140
Yitan,

216
00:15:41,390 --> 00:15:42,200
see what it is.

217
00:15:52,110 --> 00:15:54,040
This is a teleportation artifact.

218
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:57,020
The destination seems to have been carefully designed.

219
00:15:57,020 --> 00:16:00,220
You can't afford to offend Lord Jiuhuo.

220
00:16:00,440 --> 00:16:02,000
If you obediently let me go,

221
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:04,660
you might still have a chance to live.

222
00:16:06,120 --> 00:16:07,180
It's not just that.

223
00:16:08,110 --> 00:16:09,270
Your Lord Jiuhuo

224
00:16:09,750 --> 00:16:11,810
must be monitoring the scene, right?

225
00:16:13,390 --> 00:16:15,790
I have a message for him.

226
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:22,790
I will definitely take Huaizhu back.

227
00:16:22,810 --> 00:16:24,610
No matter what you're planning,

228
00:16:25,080 --> 00:16:26,360
it won't succeed.

229
00:16:27,250 --> 00:16:28,460
Interesting.

230
00:16:30,410 --> 00:16:33,460
I'll come to meet you right now.

231
00:16:44,270 --> 00:16:45,870
Young Master Wangquan.

232
00:16:48,150 --> 00:16:50,980
Does this Miss Dongfang Huaizhu you speak of

233
00:16:51,010 --> 00:16:52,920
look very similar to me

234
00:16:52,940 --> 00:16:54,420
and broke your heart?

235
00:16:55,380 --> 00:16:56,380
What do you think?

236
00:16:58,060 --> 00:16:59,440
Even so,

237
00:16:59,790 --> 00:17:00,870
you shouldn't be obsessed with me,

238
00:17:00,870 --> 00:17:02,800
someone who merely looks like her.

239
00:17:02,820 --> 00:17:04,170
Listen to my advice.

240
00:17:04,349 --> 00:17:05,880
It's not too late to turn back.

241
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:07,310
Being so persistent

242
00:17:08,069 --> 00:17:09,200
is unnecessary.

243
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:22,510
Hongye.

244
00:17:23,750 --> 00:17:24,589
I got it.

245
00:17:31,750 --> 00:17:34,310
Huaizhu really doesn't remember us at all.

246
00:17:34,830 --> 00:17:36,430
She might not remember here,

247
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:40,000
but it might be different when we return to Divine Fire Villa.

248
00:17:41,050 --> 00:17:41,850
Let's begin.

249
00:17:57,460 --> 00:17:58,890
Wangquan Hongye,

250
00:17:59,590 --> 00:18:01,270
I admit you're very clever,

251
00:18:01,770 --> 00:18:02,870
but do you know

252
00:18:03,590 --> 00:18:05,520
that in the face of absolute power,

253
00:18:05,830 --> 00:18:09,420
all schemes are worthless?

254
00:18:09,790 --> 00:18:12,440
I don't like to personally kill people,

255
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,440
but today I'll make an exception for you.

256
00:18:38,090 --> 00:18:38,890
Yitan,

257
00:18:38,910 --> 00:18:39,940
take Zui and go.

258
00:18:40,030 --> 00:18:40,510
Hongye!

259
00:18:40,530 --> 00:18:41,250
Quickly!

260
00:18:42,870 --> 00:18:43,490
Go!

261
00:18:47,680 --> 00:18:49,280
I understand your strength,

262
00:18:49,550 --> 00:18:52,450
but strategy is also part of one's strength.

263
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:18,200
Don't worry.

264
00:19:18,830 --> 00:19:20,690
Hongye always plans thoroughly.

265
00:19:20,830 --> 00:19:22,110
If he told us to leave first,

266
00:19:22,110 --> 00:19:23,570
he must have a backup plan.

267
00:19:26,030 --> 00:19:27,290
Since we can't go back,

268
00:19:29,240 --> 00:19:30,830
let's infiltrate Sky City

269
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,030
and find out what Jiuhuo is really up to.

270
00:19:33,030 --> 00:19:33,590
Alright.

271
00:19:40,190 --> 00:19:42,390
[Mount Xuankong]

272
00:19:46,350 --> 00:19:47,350
A barrier.

273
00:20:07,220 --> 00:20:08,610
Jiuhuo sent me here

274
00:20:08,630 --> 00:20:10,240
to put me in mortal danger.

275
00:20:10,270 --> 00:20:11,200
Neither of us

276
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:12,110
can get out.

277
00:20:18,350 --> 00:20:19,590
Since we can't leave,

278
00:20:20,070 --> 00:20:23,310
why don't we think of a solution together?

279
00:20:58,880 --> 00:20:59,830
Tell me,

280
00:21:00,280 --> 00:21:02,410
where is Lord Jiuhuo's

281
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:03,830
room?

282
00:21:21,270 --> 00:21:22,800
There's the smell of blood.

283
00:21:51,740 --> 00:21:53,930
The demonic aura is strong in the main hall.

284
00:21:53,930 --> 00:21:56,190
The Clairvoyance can't see clearly yet.

285
00:21:56,590 --> 00:21:57,920
Jiuhuo should be there.

286
00:21:58,310 --> 00:22:00,640
This room has no surveillance mechanisms

287
00:22:01,110 --> 00:22:02,310
or magic formations.

288
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:21,200
I heard

289
00:22:21,550 --> 00:22:25,150
the Left Guardian is also trapped in the Mount Xuankong Barrier.

290
00:22:25,590 --> 00:22:26,990
Are you happy about that?

291
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:27,960
I wouldn't dare.

292
00:22:28,890 --> 00:22:31,920
There's no way out of the Mount Xuankong Barrier.

293
00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:34,110
You need to find a solution quickly.

294
00:22:34,110 --> 00:22:35,750
The person I chose

295
00:22:36,660 --> 00:22:38,520
won't be so incompetent.

296
00:22:42,830 --> 00:22:45,090
The repair progress is behind schedule.

297
00:22:45,270 --> 00:22:46,410
Within 10 days,

298
00:22:46,570 --> 00:22:49,790
we must gather a thousand pieces of Golden Dawn fragments.

299
00:22:49,790 --> 00:22:51,400
My Lord, please rest assured.

300
00:22:51,400 --> 00:22:52,600
We'll make it in time.

301
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:54,440
The breeding ground has completed

302
00:22:54,440 --> 00:22:57,640
the refinement of the last batch of Golden Dawn fragments

303
00:22:58,440 --> 00:23:00,700
It will be delivered in the next few days.

304
00:23:05,270 --> 00:23:06,070
My Lord.

305
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:08,880
Is the food ready?

306
00:23:08,920 --> 00:23:10,030
It will be prepared immediately

307
00:23:10,030 --> 00:23:11,690
and brought to you right away.

308
00:23:11,880 --> 00:23:12,790
You may leave.

309
00:23:13,510 --> 00:23:15,350
I want to be alone for a while.

310
00:23:16,030 --> 00:23:16,790
Yes.

311
00:23:31,830 --> 00:23:34,960
The treasures and spells this demon studies

312
00:23:35,480 --> 00:23:37,000
are truly exquisite.

313
00:23:45,550 --> 00:23:48,050
The register of great demons entering the city?

314
00:23:48,050 --> 00:23:52,230
[Blind Bear, Gold-Water Red Monkey, Four-Legged Snake]

315
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:54,200
Yitan,

316
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:55,700
take a look at this.

317
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:08,060
[Six-Winged Golden Bird, Pure Fire Red Fox, Peony Demon]

318
00:24:08,830 --> 00:24:09,830
It might be a clue.

319
00:24:12,550 --> 00:24:13,240
Yitan.

320
00:24:13,750 --> 00:24:15,830
As the saying goes, capture the leader first.

321
00:24:15,830 --> 00:24:17,030
Since we're already here,

322
00:24:17,030 --> 00:24:19,200
why don't we set up an ambush

323
00:24:19,400 --> 00:24:20,600
and confront Jiuhuo?

324
00:24:20,830 --> 00:24:23,310
We've witnessed Jiuhuo's demonic power.

325
00:24:23,680 --> 00:24:25,080
Even with a sneak attack,

326
00:24:25,750 --> 00:24:27,280
we might not stand a chance.

327
00:24:48,190 --> 00:24:49,180
Right Guardian,

328
00:24:49,310 --> 00:24:50,590
there's been an incident.

329
00:24:50,590 --> 00:24:53,450
A leech demon has escaped from the breeding ground.

330
00:24:54,070 --> 00:24:56,270
How could such a major oversight occur?

331
00:24:59,280 --> 00:25:00,790
Notify everyone immediately.

332
00:25:00,790 --> 00:25:03,070
The entire city is to search for that leech demon.

333
00:25:03,070 --> 00:25:04,240
Time is running out.

334
00:25:05,510 --> 00:25:07,510
Even if it's just one piece missing,

335
00:25:07,550 --> 00:25:09,550
the Golden Dawn cannot be repaired.

336
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:10,750
Go find it quickly.

337
00:25:10,750 --> 00:25:12,640
Yes, I'll take care of it right away.

338
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:13,110
Wait.

339
00:25:15,790 --> 00:25:17,960
What about the food the lord requested?

340
00:25:17,960 --> 00:25:20,440
It should be delivered soon.

341
00:25:24,350 --> 00:25:26,620
Can't you even handle such a small task?

342
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:29,280
Is it because if Lord Jiuhuo becomes angry,

343
00:25:29,350 --> 00:25:30,310
it's my life he wants,

344
00:25:30,310 --> 00:25:31,240
not yours?

345
00:25:31,240 --> 00:25:32,170
I wouldn't dare.

346
00:25:32,310 --> 00:25:34,030
I'll go and hurry them up immediately.

347
00:25:34,030 --> 00:25:34,830
Forget it.

348
00:25:35,880 --> 00:25:37,140
I'll go find it myself.

349
00:25:46,510 --> 00:25:49,200
What secrets does Sky City hold?

350
00:25:50,140 --> 00:25:52,340
Let's go and find the leech demon first.

351
00:25:57,440 --> 00:25:58,070
He's here.

352
00:25:58,460 --> 00:25:59,120
Don't move.

353
00:26:14,350 --> 00:26:15,880
You dare to hide from me with

354
00:26:15,920 --> 00:26:18,590
a mere invisibility talisman?

355
00:26:32,310 --> 00:26:33,550
So it's you two?

356
00:26:34,630 --> 00:26:35,560
Just passing by.

357
00:26:52,510 --> 00:26:53,880
Left sword circles, right sword sinks.

358
00:26:53,880 --> 00:26:55,740
Left stab, right side step, flip.

359
00:27:04,350 --> 00:27:05,440
Interesting.

360
00:27:06,030 --> 00:27:08,200
I have food for tonight.

361
00:27:08,220 --> 00:27:10,000
Since you'll die for me,

362
00:27:10,110 --> 00:27:12,100
I'll remember your faces.

363
00:27:12,270 --> 00:27:12,920
Yitan.

364
00:27:12,920 --> 00:27:13,450
Retreat.

365
00:27:14,680 --> 00:27:16,010
Can you really retreat?

366
00:27:49,820 --> 00:27:50,450
Let's go!

367
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:08,150
In such a short time,

368
00:28:09,140 --> 00:28:11,750
you've actually figured out my demonic aura

369
00:28:11,970 --> 00:28:14,300
and temporarily learned my demonic arts.

370
00:28:17,050 --> 00:28:18,380
Interesting.

371
00:28:19,890 --> 00:28:21,310
You people

372
00:28:22,510 --> 00:28:24,710
are becoming more and more intriguing.

373
00:28:31,510 --> 00:28:33,760
This flower is identical to the one on your forehead.

374
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:35,290
What kind of flower is this?

375
00:28:36,570 --> 00:28:37,780
Mandala flower.

376
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:38,960
Mandala flower?

377
00:28:40,780 --> 00:28:42,580
When the Mandala flower appears

378
00:28:42,590 --> 00:28:45,650
is when Dongfang Huaizhu disappears.

379
00:28:47,880 --> 00:28:51,380
Are you really talking about me?

380
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:53,300
You need not doubt.

381
00:28:54,200 --> 00:28:56,650
That mandala flower is the best proof.

382
00:28:56,740 --> 00:28:58,690
To Jiuhuo, this mark

383
00:28:59,590 --> 00:29:01,590
seems to hold some special meaning.

384
00:29:03,550 --> 00:29:06,010
Was this mark drawn on you by Jiuhuo himself?

385
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:09,590
I was born with it.

386
00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:11,690
Don't believe me?

387
00:29:11,830 --> 00:29:12,750
Take a look.

388
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:19,550
Excuse me.

389
00:29:20,200 --> 00:29:22,830
Sorry for interrupting your pleasant conversation.

390
00:29:22,830 --> 00:29:24,400
Allow me to introduce myself.

391
00:29:24,400 --> 00:29:26,780
[Jia Lan, Young Fox Demon]

392
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:27,000
I am the master of this Mount Xuankong Barrier,

393
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:28,200
the fox demon Jia Lan.

394
00:29:33,880 --> 00:29:36,000
You two are pleasant on the eyes.

395
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:37,030
I am

396
00:29:37,030 --> 00:29:38,550
in a better mood already.

397
00:29:39,430 --> 00:29:40,700
You're a fox demon.

398
00:29:40,790 --> 00:29:42,200
Are you from Tushan?

399
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:44,080
Why are you here?

400
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:46,200
I'm Lord Jiuhuo's disciple.

401
00:29:48,850 --> 00:29:50,200
Your Lord Jiuhuo

402
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:52,940
often sends people here to keep you company?

403
00:29:53,480 --> 00:29:54,810
Where are those people?

404
00:29:55,640 --> 00:29:57,440
You sure have a lot of questions.

405
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:00,510
Let me tell you a secret.

406
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:02,850
In six hours,

407
00:30:03,030 --> 00:30:06,110
this Mount Xuankong will be filled with poisonous mist.

408
00:30:06,110 --> 00:30:08,480
The kind that not even a mosquito can escape from.

409
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:10,590
See? I even told you this.

410
00:30:10,750 --> 00:30:13,110
Aren't I kind and adorable?

411
00:30:15,350 --> 00:30:17,750
So they were all poisoned to death.

412
00:30:18,350 --> 00:30:20,320
Dear, when you talk like that,

413
00:30:20,400 --> 00:30:21,960
it's not fun at all.

414
00:30:22,200 --> 00:30:23,930
They didn't play the game well,

415
00:30:24,200 --> 00:30:25,730
so of course they had to die.

416
00:30:26,750 --> 00:30:29,200
Then what counts as playing well?

417
00:30:29,510 --> 00:30:31,880
Winning against me counts as playing well.

418
00:30:31,880 --> 00:30:34,270
If we win, we can leave?

419
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:36,830
Sure, you two can try.

420
00:30:42,510 --> 00:30:43,240
My Lord,

421
00:30:43,550 --> 00:30:46,200
do you want to bring her out?

422
00:30:47,720 --> 00:30:49,480
Don't you hate her?

423
00:30:50,110 --> 00:30:52,310
Why do you suddenly care about her life?

424
00:30:52,790 --> 00:30:53,750
I wouldn't dare.

425
00:30:55,240 --> 00:30:57,790
I know you must have many questions.

426
00:30:58,790 --> 00:30:59,960
Who is she?

427
00:31:00,550 --> 00:31:02,350
Why did I activate the magic formation

428
00:31:02,350 --> 00:31:04,410
to bring her 20 years into the future?

429
00:31:05,550 --> 00:31:06,830
I can only tell you

430
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:09,770
that there is someone very important to me

431
00:31:10,020 --> 00:31:12,750
who is sealed outside the human and demon realms.

432
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:14,590
To save her,

433
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:16,750
two things must be done.

434
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:18,440
Repair the Golden Dawn,

435
00:31:18,590 --> 00:31:20,370
and after adding in my demonic energy,

436
00:31:20,370 --> 00:31:23,270
I can break the barrier and bring her back.

437
00:31:23,680 --> 00:31:24,880
And the second thing?

438
00:31:26,070 --> 00:31:28,050
Is it related to the Left Guardian?

439
00:31:28,310 --> 00:31:29,590
The Left Guardian

440
00:31:30,310 --> 00:31:32,270
is the necessary condition

441
00:31:32,270 --> 00:31:33,800
to bring her back to my side.

442
00:31:33,880 --> 00:31:35,350
I observed the stars.

443
00:31:35,640 --> 00:31:37,750
This year's celestial phenomena are unusual.

444
00:31:37,750 --> 00:31:40,410
The Seven-Star Alignment will last for a month.

445
00:31:40,830 --> 00:31:42,200
During this month,

446
00:31:42,550 --> 00:31:45,440
the power of the sealing barrier will be at its weakest.

447
00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:47,760
So I activated the formation

448
00:31:47,880 --> 00:31:49,750
to bring her from 20 years ago.

449
00:31:49,970 --> 00:31:51,370
As for the Left Guardian,

450
00:31:51,790 --> 00:31:53,590
her mandala flower has bloomed.

451
00:31:53,680 --> 00:31:55,240
She absolutely cannot

452
00:31:55,240 --> 00:31:57,570
be trapped in the Mount Xuankong Barrier.

453
00:31:59,400 --> 00:32:01,110
Wangquan Hongye,

454
00:32:02,920 --> 00:32:04,780
you risked your life to come here,

455
00:32:05,070 --> 00:32:07,300
only to die at the hands of your beloved.

456
00:32:07,400 --> 00:32:08,920
This feeling

457
00:32:09,310 --> 00:32:11,350
must be wonderful, right?

458
00:32:13,270 --> 00:32:14,750
After causing chaos in Sky City

459
00:32:14,750 --> 00:32:16,950
and attempting to assassinate Jiuhuo,

460
00:32:17,030 --> 00:32:18,480
we can only find shelter

461
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:21,110
in this abandoned hut.

462
00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:26,830
I wonder how my brother and Huaizhu

463
00:32:26,830 --> 00:32:28,070
are doing now.

464
00:32:31,790 --> 00:32:32,750
Yitan!

465
00:32:37,830 --> 00:32:39,620
Did you overuse your Clairvoyance

466
00:32:39,620 --> 00:32:41,820
when fighting against Jiuhuo just now?

467
00:32:44,260 --> 00:32:45,040
I think so.

468
00:32:45,880 --> 00:32:46,590
But Zui,

469
00:32:47,210 --> 00:32:48,200
I'm a bit hungry.

470
00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:49,750
Could you get me something to eat?

471
00:32:49,750 --> 00:32:50,310
Okay.

472
00:33:09,330 --> 00:33:11,620
[Bone-Piercing Grass] [Wick Grass]

473
00:33:20,350 --> 00:33:21,510
Yang Yitan,

474
00:33:22,500 --> 00:33:24,100
you're really troublesome.

475
00:33:36,570 --> 00:33:38,030
I knew something was wrong with you.

476
00:33:38,030 --> 00:33:40,090
You're hiding your injuries from me.

477
00:33:41,070 --> 00:33:41,920
I'm fine.

478
00:33:42,920 --> 00:33:44,050
It's just a scratch.

479
00:33:44,440 --> 00:33:46,350
The wound is only as big as a fingernail.

480
00:33:46,350 --> 00:33:47,200
Really?

481
00:33:47,350 --> 00:33:48,110
Really.

482
00:33:48,750 --> 00:33:50,750
If you don't believe me, take a look.

483
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:54,880
Let me see.

484
00:34:04,350 --> 00:34:05,110
I'll do it.

485
00:34:06,800 --> 00:34:07,600
Okay.

486
00:34:08,190 --> 00:34:10,429
Zui, tie it tightly.

487
00:34:10,590 --> 00:34:13,320
Such a small wound doesn't need all this, does it?

488
00:34:14,270 --> 00:34:15,800
We're facing a great enemy.

489
00:34:15,920 --> 00:34:17,000
It's better to be cautious.

490
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:17,550
Alright.

491
00:34:27,510 --> 00:34:28,510
Does it hurt a lot?

492
00:34:42,360 --> 00:34:43,159
It's done.

493
00:35:04,360 --> 00:35:05,280
What's wrong?

494
00:35:09,190 --> 00:35:11,830
Your hair just touched my nose.

495
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:13,930
It's a bit itchy.

496
00:35:24,780 --> 00:35:26,500
You still don't look well.

497
00:35:26,520 --> 00:35:29,320
Is there anywhere else that feels uncomfortable?

498
00:35:31,170 --> 00:35:32,770
I'm just feeling a bit dizzy.

499
00:35:39,190 --> 00:35:39,850
Don't move.

500
00:36:00,730 --> 00:36:02,190
Your forehead's a bit hot.

501
00:36:11,090 --> 00:36:12,460
I'm just a bit tired.

502
00:36:13,560 --> 00:36:15,220
I'll be fine after a short nap.

503
00:36:19,100 --> 00:36:19,880
Yitan?

504
00:36:20,390 --> 00:36:21,210
Yitan!

505
00:36:23,630 --> 00:36:25,230
Since we're going to gamble,

506
00:36:25,360 --> 00:36:26,560
there must be stakes.

507
00:36:27,070 --> 00:36:28,070
I'll be the banker.

508
00:36:28,070 --> 00:36:29,360
Every time I win,

509
00:36:29,480 --> 00:36:31,190
you have to

510
00:36:31,190 --> 00:36:33,210
remove one item from each other.

511
00:36:33,440 --> 00:36:36,170
The one who ends up naked dies, okay?

512
00:36:36,630 --> 00:36:39,480
How can we win?

513
00:36:39,630 --> 00:36:42,070
Winning against me once counts as a win.

514
00:36:42,550 --> 00:36:44,000
I'm so nice, right?

515
00:36:46,480 --> 00:36:47,320
Let's begin.

516
00:36:56,360 --> 00:36:58,630
For this round, let's compare

517
00:36:58,760 --> 00:37:00,290
who has the smaller number.

518
00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:03,190
Open.

519
00:37:11,960 --> 00:37:12,990
You lost.

520
00:37:13,190 --> 00:37:14,120
This isn't fair.

521
00:37:14,190 --> 00:37:16,850
You're talking about fairness with the banker?

522
00:37:17,190 --> 00:37:19,320
Accept your loss. Take something off.

523
00:37:47,240 --> 00:37:48,460
Let's continue.

524
00:37:48,670 --> 00:37:50,360
Miss, it's your turn.

525
00:37:50,510 --> 00:37:52,370
What are we betting on this round?

526
00:37:52,440 --> 00:37:54,500
Let's bet on whether my tongue

527
00:37:54,670 --> 00:37:56,480
can touch my nose.

528
00:37:57,670 --> 00:37:59,200
I won't fall for that.

529
00:37:59,400 --> 00:38:00,590
You're a fox.

530
00:38:00,710 --> 00:38:01,740
If I say you can't,

531
00:38:01,840 --> 00:38:03,650
you'll definitely show me right away that you can.

532
00:38:03,650 --> 00:38:04,780
If I say you can,

533
00:38:04,880 --> 00:38:07,190
you'll pretend that you can't.

534
00:38:07,670 --> 00:38:08,760
I admit defeat.

535
00:38:49,340 --> 00:38:51,090
People often say

536
00:38:51,120 --> 00:38:54,000
the one who falls in love first is destined to lose.

537
00:38:54,020 --> 00:38:55,140
This young man

538
00:38:55,170 --> 00:38:56,360
is beyond saving.
