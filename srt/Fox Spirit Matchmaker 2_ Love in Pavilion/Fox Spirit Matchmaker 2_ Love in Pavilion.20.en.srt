00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:52,030
that there will surely be stars
to light your path.

146
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:07,200

148

This time,

156
00:09:47,270 --> 00:09:48,870
I'll be away for a bit longer.

157
00:09:48,940 --> 00:09:50,470
But you don't need to worry.

158
00:09:50,650 --> 00:09:52,180
Before summer ends,

159
00:09:52,610 --> 00:09:54,140
I’ll definitely come back.

160
00:10:00,110 --> 00:10:01,700
Of course I won't worry.

161
00:10:03,910 --> 00:10:05,280
Because in this world,

162
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:08,150
there are very few humans or demons

163
00:10:08,680 --> 00:10:09,880
that can kill you now.

164
00:10:24,750 --> 00:10:25,550

165
00:10:25,670 --> 00:10:27,670

What's the information?

169
00:10:33,630 --> 00:10:35,710
Master Zhang has disguised himself

170
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:37,270
and entered the Beast Kingdom again.

171
00:10:37,270 --> 00:10:38,330
The Beast Kingdom?

172
00:10:48,900 --> 00:10:51,560
This is already his third time
there this month.

174
00:10:56,550 --> 00:10:58,080

175
00:10:58,750 --> 00:10:59,720
My Lady.

176
00:10:59,870 --> 00:11:02,870

What are you trying to say?

178

All these years,

179
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:09,270
you've repeatedly invited Master Zhang
to Ruyi Pavilion,

180
00:11:09,270 --> 00:11:11,070
but he has never shown up.

181
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:14,630
He wasn't like this before.

182
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:18,900
Back when we were classmates,

183
00:11:19,750 --> 00:11:20,950
he was very kind to me.

184
00:11:22,030 --> 00:11:23,510
He even saved my life once.

185
00:11:38,870 --> 00:11:40,300
Why aren't we there yet?

186
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:41,630
It's just ahead.

187
00:12:02,150 --> 00:12:05,320
This doesn't look like a place where
night-blooming cereus would bloom.

188
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:07,320
Are you sure this is the right place?

189
00:12:17,470 --> 00:12:18,750
What are you doing?

190
00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:19,720
We're all classmates.

191
00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:21,010
Stop fooling around.

192
00:12:21,270 --> 00:12:22,750
Miss Qingmu.

193
00:12:23,550 --> 00:12:24,670
Aren't you so great that

194
00:12:24,670 --> 00:12:26,130
you look down on everyone?

195
00:12:26,360 --> 00:12:27,820
Without light,

196
00:12:27,850 --> 00:12:30,510
I'd like to see how you'll escape
this nightmare formation.

197
00:12:30,510 --> 00:12:31,320
Let's go.

198
00:12:31,390 --> 00:12:32,390
Stop right there!

199
00:12:36,010 --> 00:12:38,340
Please don't go! Don't go!

200
00:12:59,750 --> 00:13:01,750
Father! Mother!

201
00:13:08,510 --> 00:13:10,170
Are you alright, Miss Qingmu?

202
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:11,370
I'm here to save you.

203
00:13:18,790 --> 00:13:19,910
Classmate Zhang.

204
00:13:47,750 --> 00:13:48,680
Don't be afraid.

205
00:13:49,150 --> 00:13:50,480
I'll get you out of here.

206
00:13:51,870 --> 00:13:52,600
Let's go.

207
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:06,150
These are all manifestations of
your inner fears.

208
00:14:06,150 --> 00:14:07,080
Don't be afraid.

209
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:08,440
I'm here with you.

210
00:14:09,150 --> 00:14:09,950
It's alright.

211
00:14:19,150 --> 00:14:19,750
Let's go.

212
00:14:26,030 --> 00:14:26,550
Hurry.

213
00:15:09,510 --> 00:15:11,320
Thank you, Classmate Zhang.

214
00:15:15,960 --> 00:15:17,890
We were classmates for many years.

215
00:15:17,910 --> 00:15:19,570
Although he didn't talk much,

216
00:15:19,670 --> 00:15:21,200
he was extremely kind to me.

217
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:23,660
He was a very, very nice person.

218
00:15:24,080 --> 00:15:25,540
What happened after that?

219
00:15:25,750 --> 00:15:29,050
Later, he became Master Zhang Zheng.

220
00:15:29,550 --> 00:15:32,610
Since then, his temperament has changed drastically.

221
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:34,580
As you've seen,

222
00:15:35,150 --> 00:15:38,150
I've invited him as the owner of Ruyi Pavilion several times,

223
00:15:38,150 --> 00:15:39,510
but he has refused every time.

224
00:15:39,510 --> 00:15:40,550
Why?

225
00:15:41,150 --> 00:15:42,280
I don't know either.

226
00:15:43,280 --> 00:15:45,750
Since he's not interested, you might
as well give up.

227
00:15:45,750 --> 00:15:47,630
My Lady, you shouldn't bother with him anymore.

228
00:15:47,630 --> 00:15:50,360
There are a lot of people who
admire you, My Lady.

229
00:16:00,700 --> 00:16:02,230
But I just can't let him go.

230
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:05,400
Things from our youth

231
00:16:05,670 --> 00:16:06,720
sometimes

232
00:16:06,960 --> 00:16:08,010
last a lifetime.

233
00:16:10,660 --> 00:16:11,540
Zhang Zheng.

234
00:16:12,870 --> 00:16:16,150
What exactly have you been going to
the Beast Kingdom for?

235
00:16:22,870 --> 00:16:23,750
It's your turn, Zizai.

236
00:16:23,750 --> 00:16:24,290
Yitan.

237
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:25,060
Look at this.

238
00:16:25,270 --> 00:16:26,800
This is not ordinary at all.

239
00:16:26,840 --> 00:16:27,510
Hongye.

240
00:16:27,750 --> 00:16:31,550
Have you told Huaizhu that you're going to

241
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:33,910
the Beast Kingdom to investigate
the Black Fox?

242
00:16:33,910 --> 00:16:35,510
She has important matters to attend to.

243
00:16:35,510 --> 00:16:36,540
I don't want to hinder her.

244
00:16:36,540 --> 00:16:37,440
How was it? Aren't I impressive?

245
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:40,390
You two have just gotten together,
and now you have to separate.

246
00:16:40,390 --> 00:16:41,720
Is this going to be okay?

247
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:44,840
Why don't you go back and stay with Huaizhu?

248
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:46,690
Yitan and I can go by ourselves.

249
00:16:47,550 --> 00:16:49,030
Zui has a point.

250
00:16:51,390 --> 00:16:53,830
Have you arranged for someone to
meet us in the Beast Kingdom?

251
00:16:53,830 --> 00:16:55,030
Rest assured, Hongye.

252
00:16:55,030 --> 00:16:57,160
I've arranged the best person for you.

253
00:16:57,240 --> 00:16:58,080
Who is it?

254
00:16:59,040 --> 00:16:59,950
It's me.

255
00:17:01,630 --> 00:17:02,510
You?

256
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:07,270
The ruler of the Beast Kingdom has always
harbored resentment towards you, Hongye.

257
00:17:07,270 --> 00:17:09,160
If we're not careful with this mission,

258
00:17:09,160 --> 00:17:11,310
your whereabouts could be exposed, Hongye.

259
00:17:11,310 --> 00:17:12,510
So I've decided

260
00:17:12,589 --> 00:17:16,450
to personally oversee the Ruyi Pavilion branch
in the Beast Kingdom.

261
00:17:16,810 --> 00:17:19,160
The sun must be rising from the south today.

262
00:17:19,160 --> 00:17:21,810
Miss Qingmu is actually going
on a mission herself?

263
00:17:21,810 --> 00:17:22,869
Is there a problem?

264
00:17:23,270 --> 00:17:26,280
But I heard the Beast Kingdom
is very far away.

265
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:28,880
And the weather is extremely dry.

266
00:17:29,070 --> 00:17:31,500
It's not good for your skin care, Qingmu.

267
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:35,220
Don't worry. I've already thought of that.

268
00:17:35,790 --> 00:17:37,270
Besides, all my cosmetics

269
00:17:37,270 --> 00:17:38,930
have already been sent ahead.

270
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:42,090
You'll have to get up early for the mission.

271
00:17:43,070 --> 00:17:44,730
Is there anyone more suitable

272
00:17:44,790 --> 00:17:46,650
for early morning tasks than you?

273
00:17:49,240 --> 00:17:50,530
It's decided then.

274
00:17:51,030 --> 00:17:53,070
I'll go to the Beast Kingdom first to scout things out.

275
00:17:53,070 --> 00:17:55,800
Someone will be there to meet you
when you arrive.

276
00:17:57,310 --> 00:17:58,030
I'm off.

277
00:18:00,350 --> 00:18:01,680
She just left like that?

278
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:08,240
Yitan,

279
00:18:08,550 --> 00:18:11,500
did you see anything with your
Clairvoyance Eye just now?

280
00:18:11,500 --> 00:18:14,450
Qingmu was acting a bit strange.

281
00:18:15,510 --> 00:18:17,590
We can trust Qingmu to handle things.

282
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:20,660
Before I set off to the Beast Kingdom,

283
00:18:20,680 --> 00:18:23,480
there's one last important matter
to take care of.

284
00:18:26,350 --> 00:18:27,240
Yang Yitan.

285
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:38,260
Hongye.

286
00:18:38,850 --> 00:18:40,120
W-What is it?

287
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:42,210
Calling Yitan by his full name,

288
00:18:42,550 --> 00:18:43,590
it's kind of scary.

289
00:18:43,590 --> 00:18:44,400
Yang Yitan.

290
00:18:45,350 --> 00:18:46,310
The favorite of the Mask Group

291
00:18:46,310 --> 00:18:48,590
as well as the entire Wangquan Manor

292
00:18:48,770 --> 00:18:50,030
proposed to you in public,

293
00:18:50,030 --> 00:18:52,350
disregarding ethics and propriety.

294
00:18:52,620 --> 00:18:54,550
Don't you have anything to say about it?

295
00:18:54,550 --> 00:18:56,550
Don't you have anything to say about it?

296
00:18:56,550 --> 00:18:57,750
Don't you have anything to say about it?

297
00:18:57,750 --> 00:18:59,150
Anything to say about it?

298
00:19:02,440 --> 00:19:04,050
Don't bully the honest one.

299
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:07,310
Please rest assured, Hongye.

300
00:19:07,310 --> 00:19:08,750
I'll go get ready right away.

301
00:19:08,750 --> 00:19:11,000
As for the three letters and six rites,
not a single one will be missing.

302
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,830
Have your grandfather and uncle
come in person.

303
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:15,370
Understood.

304
00:19:18,790 --> 00:19:19,980
That's more like it.

305
00:19:20,040 --> 00:19:22,170
Marry Miss Wangquan,

306
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:24,300
then give me a chubby grandson,

307
00:19:24,550 --> 00:19:27,680
and the position of the Yang family master
will be yours.

308
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:30,720
Tell me, what grudge could there be
between us, Yitan?

309
00:19:31,680 --> 00:19:33,350
Yang Ying! Yang Ying!

310
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:36,750
Father.

311
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:41,160
What's the good news? Why are you shouting
so early in the morning?

312
00:19:41,160 --> 00:19:42,710
It's great news!

313
00:19:43,030 --> 00:19:44,720
Quickly, go to the butler's place

314
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:45,750
and personally oversee

315
00:19:45,750 --> 00:19:47,000
the preparation of the betrothal gifts.

316
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:49,000
Come with me to the Wangquan family.

317
00:19:49,240 --> 00:19:50,260
It's great news.

318
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:52,920
Oh, my grandson.

319
00:19:53,730 --> 00:19:57,030
[Wangquan Manor]

320
00:19:55,240 --> 00:19:57,290
The auspicious date chosen by
the Taoist priest

321
00:19:57,110 --> 00:20:02,250
[Unparalleled Sword]

322
00:19:57,510 --> 00:19:58,680
is December 5th.

323
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:02,460
We still have a few months to prepare.

324
00:20:02,590 --> 00:20:04,290
Miss Wangquan is marrying down
into our family.

325
00:20:04,290 --> 00:20:06,380
It must be a grand affair.

326
00:20:07,030 --> 00:20:10,590
However, our Yang family is not as wealthy
as your Wangquan family.

327
00:20:10,590 --> 00:20:15,240
I wonder if you're satisfied with these
betrothal gifts, Young Master.

328
00:20:15,240 --> 00:20:18,070
Our Zui doesn't lack gold, silver, or jewels.

329
00:20:18,150 --> 00:20:19,190
Sure. Sure.

330
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:23,890
I just wonder, when our Zui marries down
into your Yang family,

331
00:20:24,840 --> 00:20:26,420
what will her status be?

332
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:30,880
Will she be the wife of the Young Master
of the Yang family?

333
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:33,480
She'll surely be the wife of
our family master.

334
00:20:34,750 --> 00:20:37,630
On the day Miss Wangquan marries
into the Yang family,

335
00:20:37,630 --> 00:20:41,960
I will pass the position of
family master to Yitan.

336
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:48,400
Uncle Ying, do you have any objections?

337
00:20:49,350 --> 00:20:50,400
I wouldn't dare.

338
00:20:50,870 --> 00:20:53,750
After all, she's the daughter of
the Wangquan family.

339
00:20:53,750 --> 00:20:55,240
With the hierarchy and propriety involved,

340
00:20:55,240 --> 00:20:57,960
how could we possibly be more significant
than the Wangquan family?

341
00:20:57,960 --> 00:20:59,560
I heard that you, Uncle Ying,

342
00:20:59,680 --> 00:21:02,380
have accumulated a lot of
gambling debts out there.

343
00:21:02,380 --> 00:21:03,730
No, absolutely not.

344
00:21:04,620 --> 00:21:07,620
Young Master Wangquan, don't you
believe the rumors.

345
00:21:11,270 --> 00:21:15,160
But this has your signature and
fingerprints on it, Uncle Ying.

346
00:21:14,520 --> 00:21:15,480
[IOU]

347
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:19,170
Young Master...

348
00:21:19,270 --> 00:21:20,600
[IOU]

349
00:21:20,040 --> 00:21:22,560
Of course, since we're all family now,

350
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:24,800
Uncle Ying, your matters

351
00:21:25,560 --> 00:21:27,690
are the matters of the Wangquan Manor.

352
00:21:28,920 --> 00:21:30,880
Thank you, Young Master Wangquan.

353
00:21:31,750 --> 00:21:35,080
The Wangquan Manor is indeed
the cream of the Yiqi Alliance.

354
00:21:35,240 --> 00:21:36,880
What virtue or ability does our
Yang family have

355
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:38,720
to be worthy of an alliance with
the Wangquan family?

356
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:40,460
This is truly a blessing of three lifetimes.

357
00:21:40,460 --> 00:21:42,000
Our humble abode is illuminated
by your presence.

358
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:42,930
There's no rush.

359
00:21:43,510 --> 00:21:45,710
I have another gift for you, Uncle Ying.

360
00:21:48,540 --> 00:21:49,900
I bought two mines.

361
00:21:50,710 --> 00:21:51,590
Jade mines.

362
00:21:52,660 --> 00:21:54,840
Young Master, you're too generous.

363
00:21:55,160 --> 00:21:56,880
Well, a good business opportunity
waits for no one.

364
00:21:56,880 --> 00:21:59,830
Uncle Ying, please leave for Nanchui immediately
to make your fortune.

365
00:21:59,830 --> 00:22:01,080
Nan... Nanchui?

366
00:22:01,270 --> 00:22:02,770
But Nanchui is a chaotic mix
of humans and demons.

367
00:22:02,770 --> 00:22:04,030
Is the carriage ready?

368
00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:05,030
Yes, everything's ready.

369
00:22:05,030 --> 00:22:06,200
I... I still have my family.

370
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:08,170
Young Master Yang, your legitimate wife
and concubines,

371
00:22:08,170 --> 00:22:09,800
along with three mistresses

372
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:11,310
as well as seven children

373
00:22:11,310 --> 00:22:12,750
have all been gathered.

374
00:22:13,130 --> 00:22:15,430
They're all in the carriage
outside the manor.

375
00:22:15,430 --> 00:22:16,510
It seems...

376
00:22:17,160 --> 00:22:19,160
They've already started fighting.

377
00:22:19,510 --> 00:22:24,240
What are you waiting for? Escort Uncle Ying to make his fortune
in Nanchui right away.

378
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:25,480
Please.

379
00:22:26,260 --> 00:22:27,980
Father, say something!

380
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:51,730
I'm very satisfied with the betrothal gifts.

381
00:22:52,130 --> 00:22:54,610
December 5th, it's settled then.

382
00:23:02,560 --> 00:23:09,450
[Unparalleled Sword]

383
00:23:03,800 --> 00:23:05,030
They have been sent off.

384
00:23:05,030 --> 00:23:06,200
Before he even got on the carriage,

385
00:23:06,200 --> 00:23:08,200
his legitimate wife and mistresses

386
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:11,170
had already scratched his face
beyond recognition.

387
00:23:12,110 --> 00:23:13,680
Send a message to Poison King.

388
00:23:13,680 --> 00:23:15,220
Tell him I don't want this person

389
00:23:15,220 --> 00:23:17,020
to leave Nanchui for even a step.

390
00:23:17,270 --> 00:23:17,750
Yes.

391
00:23:25,150 --> 00:23:26,210
Alright, come out.

392
00:23:29,950 --> 00:23:33,430
[Unparalleled Sword]

393
00:23:31,230 --> 00:23:32,490
You heard everything?

394
00:23:33,750 --> 00:23:35,680
I heard you bullying people with your power,

395
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:38,400
sending them off to Nanchui without even
letting their feet touch the ground,

396
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:40,770
and forbidding them from ever coming back.

397
00:23:40,770 --> 00:23:41,340
Zui.

398
00:23:43,670 --> 00:23:44,270
Catch it.

399
00:23:46,150 --> 00:23:48,410
The apples offered to our ancestors will

400
00:23:48,750 --> 00:23:50,410
bring us good luck and safety.

401
00:23:50,450 --> 00:23:51,640
If you're against it,

402
00:23:51,280 --> 00:23:57,630
[Unparalleled Sword]

403
00:23:51,750 --> 00:23:52,880
I can call him back.

404
00:23:53,240 --> 00:23:54,240
I am against it.

405
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:56,930
Because you're too kind to him.

406
00:23:56,930 --> 00:23:58,270
You even bought him mines,

407
00:23:58,270 --> 00:23:59,530
and two of them at that.

408
00:23:59,870 --> 00:24:01,670
What I bought is your reputation

409
00:24:01,680 --> 00:24:03,740
after marrying into the Yang family.

410
00:24:04,500 --> 00:24:05,760
That's still not okay.

411
00:24:06,830 --> 00:24:09,080
Whenever I think of Aunt Yang Yan,

412
00:24:09,590 --> 00:24:10,920
I get angry.

413
00:24:11,850 --> 00:24:13,110
Then think about this.

414
00:24:13,550 --> 00:24:16,380
Why would they sell such profitable mines?

415
00:24:17,510 --> 00:24:19,110
Is it possible that there are

416
00:24:19,110 --> 00:24:22,350
some bad debts or grudges involved?

417
00:24:27,270 --> 00:24:28,460
Now that's more like it.

418
00:24:28,460 --> 00:24:29,860
This is the Hongye I know.

419
00:24:29,880 --> 00:24:30,880
Ruthless enough.

420
00:24:40,010 --> 00:24:41,000
Zui,

421
00:24:43,350 --> 00:24:44,000
I...

422
00:25:05,940 --> 00:25:08,670
Aren't there still a few months
before I get married?

423
00:25:08,670 --> 00:25:11,270
There's still time for this kind of fussy talk.

424
00:25:11,310 --> 00:25:12,310
You hold it in.

425
00:25:12,590 --> 00:25:14,790
We'll talk about it when the time comes.

426
00:25:20,470 --> 00:25:21,840
Well, Hongye, you're also quite busy.

427
00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:24,080
You still need to get ready for your trip
to the Beast Kingdom.

428
00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:24,940
I'll leave now.

429
00:25:34,890 --> 00:25:35,480
Hongye.

430
00:25:38,350 --> 00:25:39,360
Thank you.

431
00:25:41,580 --> 00:25:43,510
I hope you'll be happy too, Hongye.

432
00:26:17,670 --> 00:26:20,550
I've been cultivating with that leech demon
for quite some time.

433
00:26:20,550 --> 00:26:24,350
I hope this time, I can break through
the limitations of my bloodline

434
00:26:24,690 --> 00:26:27,220
and control the true Divine Fire.

435
00:27:00,750 --> 00:27:01,920
Jin Renfeng.

436
00:27:03,550 --> 00:27:04,310
Tell me,

437
00:27:04,970 --> 00:27:06,400
what can I gain

438
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:08,160
by serving under you?

439
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:10,410
Opportunities, of course,

440
00:27:10,850 --> 00:27:12,030
and power.

441
00:27:12,310 --> 00:27:13,350
Opportunities?

442
00:27:14,830 --> 00:27:15,510
Power?

443
00:27:15,530 --> 00:27:17,060
With your qualifications,

444
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:19,240
you can only climb so high.

445
00:27:19,840 --> 00:27:21,770
Humans have such short lifespans.

446
00:27:21,790 --> 00:27:23,560
You might work hard your entire life

447
00:27:23,560 --> 00:27:24,590
and end up as nothing more than

448
00:27:24,590 --> 00:27:26,870
an insignificant small-time boss.

449
00:27:32,150 --> 00:27:32,830
Alright.

450
00:27:33,620 --> 00:27:34,250
Tell me,

451
00:27:35,510 --> 00:27:36,840
what can I do for you?

452
00:27:37,720 --> 00:27:40,030
Do you know where

453
00:27:40,310 --> 00:27:41,710
Dongfang Huaizhu is now?

454
00:27:43,070 --> 00:27:45,390
They've set off to the Drunken Dream Tower
in the Beast Kingdom

455
00:27:45,390 --> 00:27:46,920
to get the Twilight Mist Flower.

456
00:27:46,920 --> 00:27:48,240
Twilight Mist Flower?

457
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:50,510
Jin Renfeng.

458
00:27:50,790 --> 00:27:52,160
Your primary task now

459
00:27:52,490 --> 00:27:54,350
is to beat Dongfang Huaizhu

460
00:27:54,350 --> 00:27:55,880
in finding the tower master

461
00:27:55,960 --> 00:27:57,640
and obtaining the Twilight Mist Flower.

462
00:27:57,640 --> 00:27:59,170
Why would they listen to me?

463
00:27:59,350 --> 00:28:01,720
Go send a message to the ruler of
the Beast Kingdom.

464
00:28:01,720 --> 00:28:05,370
Tell him that Wangquan Hongye is infiltrating
the Beast Kingdom.

465
00:28:05,370 --> 00:28:08,110
The ruler of the Beast Kingdom hates him
as much as you do.

466
00:28:08,110 --> 00:28:09,350
He will help you.

467
00:28:09,920 --> 00:28:11,030
Now is the perfect time

468
00:28:11,030 --> 00:28:13,920
to kill Wangquan Hongye.

469
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:24,000
Wangquan Hongye and Dongfang Huaizhu have set off
to the Beast Kingdom.

470
00:28:24,530 --> 00:28:27,100
They are changing the course of fate.

471
00:28:27,350 --> 00:28:30,800
Lord Jiuhuo, you must stop them.

472
00:28:31,660 --> 00:28:33,660
Let me take some time to recuperate.

473
00:28:34,530 --> 00:28:37,210
I will go back to handle this matter personally.

474
00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:39,240
But that's too slow.

475
00:28:39,970 --> 00:28:43,200
Your demon core is severely damaged,
and your magical artifact has been destroyed.

476
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:45,240
It won't be easy for you to go back.

477
00:28:46,590 --> 00:28:49,150
But human desires never cease.

478
00:28:51,990 --> 00:28:53,850
I've already placed my pawns.

479
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:57,130
You mean that Jin Renfeng from Divine Fire Villa.

480
00:28:57,240 --> 00:29:00,350
I hope he won't disappoint me.

481
00:29:17,270 --> 00:29:18,160
Here, ladies.

482
00:29:18,390 --> 00:29:18,830
Sorry for the long wait.

483
00:29:18,830 --> 00:29:19,430
Thank you.

484
00:29:19,640 --> 00:29:20,440
Please enjoy.

485
00:29:22,400 --> 00:29:23,240
Huaizhu,

486
00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:25,440
so this is the Beast Kingdom.

487
00:29:25,960 --> 00:29:27,270
There are so many demons here.

488
00:29:27,270 --> 00:29:28,730
It's really interesting.

489
00:29:31,830 --> 00:29:35,310
The National Preceptor has ordered
the city gates to be closed.

490
00:29:35,310 --> 00:29:37,510
Everyone has to get their identity verified.

491
00:29:37,510 --> 00:29:38,310
Go over there.

492
00:29:38,440 --> 00:29:40,520
Nobody moves.

493
00:29:41,020 --> 00:29:42,920
Anyone who dares to act recklessly

494
00:29:42,920 --> 00:29:45,520
will be treated as a spy from
the Yiqi Alliance.

495
00:29:45,810 --> 00:29:46,570
Search them!

496
00:29:48,760 --> 00:29:49,530
Officer,

497
00:29:49,680 --> 00:29:50,880
what's going on?

498
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:53,400
Recently, some disciples from the noble families
of the Yiqi Alliance

499
00:29:53,400 --> 00:29:55,400
have infiltrated our Beast Kingdom.

500
00:29:55,400 --> 00:29:57,840
Among all the guests in this tavern,

501
00:29:57,960 --> 00:29:59,590
those without identity tokens

502
00:29:59,590 --> 00:30:02,200
and those with tokens but no accompanying demons

503
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:04,110
will all be taken away for questioning.

504
00:30:04,110 --> 00:30:04,700
You.

505
00:30:05,680 --> 00:30:06,310
Stop there.

506
00:30:06,310 --> 00:30:07,110
Move forward.

507
00:30:10,400 --> 00:30:11,510
Who are you two?

508
00:30:12,530 --> 00:30:13,210
Let him go.

509
00:30:14,270 --> 00:30:15,720
Show your identity tokens.

510
00:30:15,720 --> 00:30:17,180
We are from the Pulan Clan.

511
00:30:17,920 --> 00:30:18,750
Pulan Clan?

512
00:30:20,270 --> 00:30:21,480
Where are your accompanying demons?

513
00:30:21,480 --> 00:30:22,700
We didn't bring them with us.

514
00:30:22,700 --> 00:30:25,510
Dressed like nobles yet without demons.

515
00:30:26,160 --> 00:30:26,880
Suspicious.

516
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:28,590
Not bringing them doesn't mean we don't have any.

517
00:30:28,590 --> 00:30:30,280
I forgot to bring my brain too.

518
00:30:30,300 --> 00:30:31,700
Stop being smart with me.

519
00:30:31,790 --> 00:30:32,430
Where's your token?

520
00:30:32,430 --> 00:30:33,290
Take them away.

521
00:30:34,510 --> 00:30:35,110
Come here.

522
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:39,170
Let's go.

523
00:30:41,310 --> 00:30:42,070
Those in the back.

524
00:30:42,070 --> 00:30:42,640
Show your identity tokens.

525
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:43,150
You.

526
00:30:43,640 --> 00:30:44,440
Go over there.

527
00:30:47,290 --> 00:30:48,000
Move.

528
00:30:48,850 --> 00:30:49,510
Yours.

529
00:30:52,560 --> 00:30:53,510
Madam.

530
00:30:53,830 --> 00:30:55,750
Go send a message to Ruyi Pavilion.

531
00:30:55,750 --> 00:30:59,190
These two look like they're from Divine Fire Villa.

532
00:30:59,350 --> 00:30:59,960
Got it.

533
00:31:01,250 --> 00:31:02,270
Let's go.

534
00:31:08,460 --> 00:31:09,390
Officer,

535
00:31:10,750 --> 00:31:12,760
it's almost dinner time.

536
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:14,550
Even if you won't release us,

537
00:31:14,550 --> 00:31:16,230
at least give us some food.

538
00:31:17,210 --> 00:31:18,050
Be quiet.

539
00:31:18,920 --> 00:31:21,790
I've been so busy all day, and I'm just now
getting to eat some warm food.

540
00:31:21,790 --> 00:31:23,190
I'll deal with you later.

541
00:31:26,440 --> 00:31:28,530
Who's so bold as to even dare

542
00:31:28,680 --> 00:31:31,220
arrest the young ladies of our Erzhu family?

543
00:31:54,370 --> 00:31:55,260
Huaizhu!

544
00:31:56,350 --> 00:31:57,160
Ladies.

545
00:31:58,790 --> 00:32:00,590
I've finally found you, ladies.

546
00:32:05,520 --> 00:32:06,920
Why did you come only now?

547
00:32:09,110 --> 00:32:10,310
What did you just say?

548
00:32:10,750 --> 00:32:12,350
They are from the Erzhu Clan?

549
00:32:13,730 --> 00:32:16,060
They are even the young ladies of the clan?

550
00:32:17,100 --> 00:32:20,530
Would the young ladies of the Erzhu family

551
00:32:20,680 --> 00:32:21,790
run around the streets without
an identity token

552
00:32:21,790 --> 00:32:23,390
or any accompanying demons?

553
00:32:27,920 --> 00:32:30,640
Here's their identity token.

554
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:46,800
Open the door.

555
00:32:48,070 --> 00:32:48,640
Hurry up.

556
00:32:53,400 --> 00:32:54,440
Why are you pushing me?

557
00:32:54,440 --> 00:32:55,400
If you gained a few less pounds,

558
00:32:55,400 --> 00:32:57,260
we wouldn't be blocking the door.

559
00:33:05,270 --> 00:33:06,350
My Lady.

560
00:33:06,510 --> 00:33:08,270
I apologize for being late.

561
00:33:08,270 --> 00:33:10,790
Sorry for having made you suffer.

562
00:33:16,600 --> 00:33:18,500
Qinlan, let's go.

563
00:33:19,160 --> 00:33:20,640
Right. Let's go.

564
00:33:23,030 --> 00:33:24,030
Stop right there.

565
00:33:28,110 --> 00:33:30,440
Although this identity token is genuine,

566
00:33:30,510 --> 00:33:32,750
the National Preceptor has given a strict order.

567
00:33:32,750 --> 00:33:35,310
We underlings don't dare to be careless.

568
00:33:35,790 --> 00:33:38,640
So, young ladies, could you please explain?

569
00:33:41,640 --> 00:33:42,610
Explain what?

570
00:33:43,870 --> 00:33:46,680
You two ladies just didn't
bring the identity token

571
00:33:46,680 --> 00:33:47,920
and had no accompanying demons with you.

572
00:33:47,920 --> 00:33:50,830
Why didn't you say anything
when you got arrested?

573
00:34:04,750 --> 00:34:06,920
Right, speaking of that,

574
00:34:07,070 --> 00:34:09,070
we haven't settled the score with you yet.

575
00:34:09,070 --> 00:34:10,360
For no reason at all,

576
00:34:10,440 --> 00:34:12,800
you arrested the young lady of our Erzhu family.

577
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:14,710
And now you're questioning our young lady?

578
00:34:14,710 --> 00:34:17,310
You... You're making your offense even worse!

579
00:34:19,320 --> 00:34:22,090
If you don't give a reasonable explanation,

580
00:34:22,150 --> 00:34:25,010
I'll sit in this jail until I wear a hole
in the floor!

581
00:34:25,030 --> 00:34:25,650
You...

582
00:34:26,090 --> 00:34:26,550
Wait...

583
00:34:26,550 --> 00:34:28,510
We're not leaving anymore.

584
00:34:28,510 --> 00:34:29,380
This, this...

585
00:34:29,550 --> 00:34:30,630
Look how dilapidated this jail cell is.

586
00:34:30,630 --> 00:34:33,090
At night, it's full of cockroaches and rats.

587
00:34:35,190 --> 00:34:36,360
Look, this place is really filthy.

588
00:34:36,360 --> 00:34:38,420
Please, let your demon carry you out.

589
00:34:38,880 --> 00:34:40,010
I can walk by myself.

590
00:34:41,320 --> 00:34:42,440
-Let's go.
-Come on, let's go.

591
00:34:42,440 --> 00:34:44,150
Huaizhu, wait for me!

592
00:34:44,280 --> 00:34:45,280
Let's go.

593
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:47,630
What's the rush?

594
00:34:49,590 --> 00:34:50,440
Be careful. Be careful.

595
00:34:50,440 --> 00:34:51,670
Bro, be careful.

596
00:34:53,150 --> 00:34:54,290
What are you doing?

597
00:34:58,910 --> 00:35:00,030
Give it to me.

598
00:35:04,690 --> 00:35:07,750
This humble one respectfully
sees you off, Miss Erzhu.

599
00:35:26,760 --> 00:35:27,900
That was close.

600
00:35:28,360 --> 00:35:31,890
If we had delayed any longer, we would
have been caught for sure.

601
00:35:32,590 --> 00:35:34,470
So it's you two.

602
00:35:36,840 --> 00:35:38,170
I really couldn't tell.

603
00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:42,940
How are you? You're not hurt, are you?

604
00:35:44,320 --> 00:35:45,030
I'm fine.

605
00:35:46,150 --> 00:35:48,760
So that screeching female demon just now

606
00:35:48,840 --> 00:35:49,800
was you, huh?

607
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:51,930
Is this how you talk to your savior?

608
00:35:53,350 --> 00:35:54,150
This is great.

609
00:35:55,220 --> 00:35:57,220
I didn't expect to run into you here.

610
00:35:58,800 --> 00:35:59,760
I thought...

611
00:36:03,670 --> 00:36:05,000
Just talk if you want to talk.

612
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:06,730
Why are you getting all handsy?

613
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:08,960
Sorry for the offense, Miss Qinlan.

614
00:36:09,880 --> 00:36:10,940
However, Huaizhu,

615
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:13,360
how did you know those two demons were them?

616
00:36:13,670 --> 00:36:15,150
Li Quzhuo had something written on his hand.

617
00:36:15,150 --> 00:36:16,070
What was it?

618
00:36:21,220 --> 00:36:22,790
[Sister-in-law]

619
00:36:34,920 --> 00:36:35,880
What was it?

620
00:36:45,150 --> 00:36:46,000
It's gone.

621
00:36:46,760 --> 00:36:47,700
You...

622
00:36:48,150 --> 00:36:48,840
It's gone.

623
00:36:49,950 --> 00:36:52,160
How did you know we were here?

624
00:36:53,360 --> 00:36:55,670
Hongye heard at Ruyi Pavilion that
you were arrested.

625
00:36:55,670 --> 00:36:57,150
He was beside himself with worry.

626
00:36:57,150 --> 00:37:00,400
He was even ready to storm the Beast Kingdom
with his sword.

627
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:01,400
Guess what I said.

628
00:37:01,670 --> 00:37:03,670
"Hongye, don't be hasty.

629
00:37:04,440 --> 00:37:07,320
Let me think of a foolproof plan."

630
00:37:07,740 --> 00:37:08,070
So...

631
00:37:08,070 --> 00:37:09,360
In short,

632
00:37:09,800 --> 00:37:12,400
Qingmu Yuan gave us
demon disguise talismans.

633
00:37:14,230 --> 00:37:15,030
Thanks a lot.

634
00:37:16,440 --> 00:37:18,700
Although I don't know your purpose here,

635
00:37:18,840 --> 00:37:22,030
given the current situation, why don't we...

636
00:37:22,440 --> 00:37:23,550
There's no need for that.

637
00:37:23,550 --> 00:37:25,350
Let's just go our separate ways.

638
00:37:25,400 --> 00:37:27,110
Now the entire Beast Kingdom is on high alert,

639
00:37:27,110 --> 00:37:28,400
hunting for members of the Yiqi Alliance.

640
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:31,060
If we stay with you, we'll be in
even more danger.

641
00:37:32,110 --> 00:37:32,840
That's true.

642
00:37:34,150 --> 00:37:34,710
Quzhuo.

643
00:37:38,110 --> 00:37:40,030
Take these two identity tokens.

644
00:37:40,360 --> 00:37:42,880
If anything happens, come find me
at Ruyi Pavilion.

645
00:37:42,880 --> 00:37:43,940
But what about you?

646
00:37:44,220 --> 00:37:45,060
We have more.

647
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:49,800
Let's go, Huaizhu.

648
00:37:49,800 --> 00:37:51,930
His eyes are practically glued to you.

649
00:38:01,620 --> 00:38:02,270
Let's go.
