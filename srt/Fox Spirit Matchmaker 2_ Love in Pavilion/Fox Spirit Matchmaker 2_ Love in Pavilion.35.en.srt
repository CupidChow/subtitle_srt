The main gate of the manor has been split open.

Unfortunately,

You think I'm afraid of...

just you few?

41
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:02,240
Of course not. You're not afraid.

42
00:06:05,230 --> 00:06:08,460
Back then, the old hero Dongfang was a prodigy.

43
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:11,630
He single-handedly established the Divine Fire Villa,

44
00:06:11,630 --> 00:06:14,520
even rivaling the Wangquan Manor.

45
00:06:14,750 --> 00:06:16,210
Even our old family master

46
00:06:16,310 --> 00:06:17,800
held the old hero Dongfang

47
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:19,680
in the highest regard.

48
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:23,920
So even if Wind, Rain, Thunder, and Lightning all attack together,

49
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:26,750
as the senior disciple of the old hero Dongfang,

50
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:28,360
what is there to fear?

00:06:28,950 --> 00:06:29,810
Nothing at all.

57
00:06:40,909 --> 00:06:44,000
is insisting on interfering with the internal affairs of the Divine Fire Villa.

00:06:46,030 --> 00:06:48,830
Do you think I will show you any respect?

60

Whether you show respect or not

61
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:54,000
depends on how determined we are.

The Wangquan family

63
00:06:56,680 --> 00:06:59,630
doesn't have talents as outstanding as you, Mr. Jin,

64
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:02,170

Do I look like I'm joking?

As for whether the marriage was arranged or not,

85
00:08:13,510 --> 00:08:16,010
I think it's unnecessary.

91
00:08:45,890 --> 00:08:48,090
As expected of the Wangquan Manor!

92
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:50,320
You're clearly relying on strength in numbers,

93
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:52,180
bullying others with your power.

94
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:53,580
Forgive my frankness,

95
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:56,300
but even though you have more people,

Besides, the Wangquan Manor may have many people,

100
00:09:09,150 --> 00:09:11,550

Mr. Jin, you're indeed a top figure among the sects

105

and one of the strongest fighters.

106
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:32,430
And I have heard

107
00:09:32,750 --> 00:09:34,000
that you've received

108
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:38,320
the Divine Fire secret technique,
personally passed down by the late hero Dongfang.

109
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:41,120
Your skill must have improved by leaps and bounds.

110

Of course, I'm impressed by the Dongfang family's

111

secret technique for fast learning,

112
00:09:48,550 --> 00:09:52,270
but what I admire even more is

113
00:09:52,450 --> 00:09:55,420
the magnanimity of the old hero Dongfang.

114
00:09:55,930 --> 00:09:58,940
He generously gave the Divine Fire secret technique

115
00:09:59,080 --> 00:10:01,270
to you, Mr. Jin, who was neither his son

116
00:10:01,390 --> 00:10:04,150
nor his son-in-law.

117
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:07,670
He didn't worry at all that after learning the true teachings,

118
00:10:07,670 --> 00:10:10,200
you might turn against his own daughter

119
00:10:10,390 --> 00:10:12,720
and take over Divine Fire Villa.

120
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,860
This is an internal matter of the Divine Fire Villa.

I trust you, Mr. Jin.

126

However,

127
00:10:28,810 --> 00:10:32,840

it might be impossible for you to start from scratch.

And the quantity you require is not small.

430
00:33:50,310 --> 00:33:52,550
Currently, the herbs available in the manor for making these pills

431
00:33:52,550 --> 00:33:53,680
are far from enough.

432
00:33:53,720 --> 00:33:54,590
