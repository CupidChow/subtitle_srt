00:01:40,810 --> 00:01:45,630
[Love in Pavilion]

2
00:01:46,390 --> 00:01:50,810
[Episode 16]

3
00:02:07,230 --> 00:02:08,830
They have a point.

4
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:11,800
You've only known them for a few days.

5
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:14,000
Is it really worth the risk to go with them?

6
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,520
Listen to them and go sightseeing instead.

7
00:02:21,590 --> 00:02:24,000
Anyway, I really should thank you.

8
00:02:25,190 --> 00:02:26,530
Thank you for treating my cousin

9
00:02:26,530 --> 00:02:28,070
and Mr. Wangquan.

10
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:29,190
Thank you,

11
00:02:29,870 --> 00:02:30,710
Miss Cuiyu.

12
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:32,000
Thank me?

13
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:35,800
Well...

14
00:02:37,110 --> 00:02:39,240
how about repaying me with your heart?

15
00:02:39,770 --> 00:02:40,570
Miss Cuiyu...

16
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:46,340
Miss Cuiyu,

17
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,200
this joke is a bit much, don't you think?

18
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:56,480
Dummy,

19
00:02:57,150 --> 00:02:58,190
don't you think

20
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:02,030
you might like me a little bit?

21
00:03:30,579 --> 00:03:32,460
Your heart's beating so fast.

22
00:03:33,390 --> 00:03:34,780
That means yes.

23
00:03:36,590 --> 00:03:37,520
Great.

24
00:03:39,870 --> 00:03:40,870
Next question.

25
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:43,280
Which version of me do you actually like?

26
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:45,520
The red-eyed Cuiyu Mingluan

27
00:03:45,710 --> 00:03:47,360
or the blue-eyed one?

28
00:03:50,010 --> 00:03:51,210
Aren't they both you?

29
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:52,280
Of course not.

30
00:03:52,710 --> 00:03:53,960
She's her, I'm me.

31
00:03:54,530 --> 00:03:56,530
Think carefully before you answer.

32
00:03:56,590 --> 00:03:58,000
Don't get it wrong.

33
00:03:58,780 --> 00:04:00,360
And what counts as a right answer?

34
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:01,710
You tell me.

35
00:04:04,630 --> 00:04:06,120
You already have the answer in your heart.

36
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:07,320
How else can I answer?

37
00:04:07,870 --> 00:04:10,320
You're teasing me, and that's not fair.

38
00:04:11,030 --> 00:04:12,520
How am I teasing you?

39
00:04:15,710 --> 00:04:17,990
Red Eyes always acts too intensely.

40
00:04:18,269 --> 00:04:20,269
It's time for Blue Eyes to take over.

41
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,130
You answered wrong.

42
00:04:24,510 --> 00:04:27,120
So you do prefer the gentleness of Blue Eyes.

43
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:34,640
Girls don't necessarily have to be gentle.

44
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:36,520
But as humans,

45
00:04:38,870 --> 00:04:40,330
we should at least be kind.

46
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:42,190
I'm not human.

47
00:04:42,310 --> 00:04:43,270
I'm a demon.

48
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:45,250
The same applies to demons.

49
00:04:51,430 --> 00:04:52,240
Alright then.

50
00:04:53,870 --> 00:04:55,130
I know your answer now.

51
00:05:07,690 --> 00:05:09,220
Take care, Miss Cuiyu.

52
00:05:11,390 --> 00:05:13,040
I wonder when

53
00:05:14,690 --> 00:05:16,310
we'll meet again.

54
00:05:23,830 --> 00:05:24,630
Cousin,

55
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:27,540
I know you don't want me to take risks,

56
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:30,680
but I can't stop worrying about you.

57
00:05:56,409 --> 00:05:58,010
Why didn't you let me out?

58
00:05:58,750 --> 00:06:00,630
Why didn't you let me see Mr. Mu?

59
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:01,510
Shut up.

60
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:04,160
You're becoming more and more extreme.

61
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:05,070
Be careful,

62
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:07,000
don't let Golden Dawn influence you.

63
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,680
Shut up!

64
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:10,680
With Mr. Mu's character,

65
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:12,750
he would never abandon his cousin.

66
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:17,830
He deliberately pushed you away because he was worried you might be in danger.

67
00:06:18,390 --> 00:06:19,720
How do you know that?

68
00:06:20,410 --> 00:06:22,300
He likes you

69
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:25,240
because you're gentle and kind, right?

70
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:28,020
We can talk about what's between us later.

71
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:30,120
Right now, the priority is Mr. Mu.

72
00:06:44,420 --> 00:06:45,630
What are you doing?

73
00:06:46,490 --> 00:06:48,420
You like Dummy too, don't you?

74
00:06:51,010 --> 00:06:54,250
You heard the questions I asked him today.

75
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:56,560
He likes us.

76
00:06:58,390 --> 00:06:59,750
To be precise,

77
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:01,680
he likes you.

78
00:07:02,950 --> 00:07:04,240
Just like you,

79
00:07:04,430 --> 00:07:06,800
he thinks I'm a frightening monster.

80
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:09,380
We don't think that of you.

81
00:07:09,390 --> 00:07:10,360
"We?"

82
00:07:11,620 --> 00:07:13,000
What a "we."

83
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:15,070
Are you two a couple now?

84
00:07:15,430 --> 00:07:16,310
What?

85
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:18,630
From now on, with him protecting you,

86
00:07:18,630 --> 00:07:20,510
you don't need me anymore, do you?

87
00:07:24,470 --> 00:07:26,270
So this really is what you think.

88
00:07:26,390 --> 00:07:27,560
Therefore,

89
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:29,720
it's your turn to repay me.

90
00:07:38,630 --> 00:07:39,740
What are you doing?

91
00:07:43,870 --> 00:07:45,940
I'm going to make you sleep forever,

92
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:47,560
never to wake up.

93
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:57,720
You're so weak,

94
00:07:58,390 --> 00:07:59,750
so incompetent.

95
00:08:00,950 --> 00:08:02,880
Why are you the one who has his love?

96
00:08:03,630 --> 00:08:06,630
And why should you get to have our body all to yourself?

97
00:08:06,950 --> 00:08:07,800
Why?

98
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:26,720
My craftsmanship from 20 years ago

99
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:28,660
is really rough.

100
00:08:30,270 --> 00:08:31,800
But if you give me some time,

101
00:08:32,789 --> 00:08:33,840
I can fix it.

102
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:40,610
But there's nothing I can do about Huaizhu

103
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:45,250
being controlled by the demonic aura.

104
00:08:49,510 --> 00:08:51,170
I will definitely wake her up.

105
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:54,370
I won't let her be consumed by the demonic aura

106
00:08:54,510 --> 00:08:56,080
and turned into the Black Fox's vessel.

107
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:57,360
According to what you said,

108
00:08:57,360 --> 00:09:00,720
the fragments of the Golden Dawn are refined using the life of demons.

109
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:01,720
Above that magical artifact,

110
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:04,080
there must be the Soul Summoning Umbrella of the Netherworld Clan.

111
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:05,740
The Soul Summoning Umbrella?

112
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,200
This umbrella can purify resentment.

113
00:09:08,670 --> 00:09:12,000
Perhaps it can also purify the demonic aura inside Huaizhu.

114
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:14,980
But I must first deal with Jiuhuo.

115
00:09:16,030 --> 00:09:18,000
He is the root of all this chaos.

116
00:09:18,750 --> 00:09:19,600
Don't worry.

117
00:09:20,870 --> 00:09:22,320
I've sent people to obtain

118
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:25,120
the dragon's blood you wanted, no matter the cost.

119
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:27,200
It's already on its way here.

120
00:09:27,870 --> 00:09:29,270
Jiuhuo is injured.

121
00:09:30,130 --> 00:09:33,190
Tomorrow night at midnight will be his weakest moment.

122
00:09:33,390 --> 00:09:34,750
We'll act then.

123
00:09:41,910 --> 00:09:44,390
Tomorrow's battle will be the final one.

124
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:46,750
Huaizhu,

125
00:09:47,630 --> 00:09:49,490
I will definitely bring you back.

126
00:10:08,270 --> 00:10:09,910
Wangquan Hongye,

127
00:10:11,630 --> 00:10:13,240
are you ready?

128
00:10:28,150 --> 00:10:29,080
Lord Jiuhuo,

129
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:33,620
all the first generation elders of the Netherworld Clan are here.

130
00:10:36,870 --> 00:10:39,450
Greetings, Lord Jiuhuo.

131
00:10:39,550 --> 00:10:41,510
You are all my clan members.

132
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:43,550
If I had other choices,

133
00:10:43,550 --> 00:10:45,510
I wouldn't have to kill you.

134
00:11:02,210 --> 00:11:05,290
My Lord, you're doing this out of necessity.

135
00:11:07,090 --> 00:11:10,430
To die for you is our honor.

136
00:11:12,850 --> 00:11:14,430
Without the leech demon,

137
00:11:14,870 --> 00:11:16,270
this is the only way

138
00:11:16,290 --> 00:11:18,790
to fix the last gap in the Golden Dawn.

139
00:11:31,270 --> 00:11:32,330
Jia Lan,

140
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:35,960
we will meet again eventually.

141
00:12:25,690 --> 00:12:26,850
Jiuhuo,

142
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:29,440
your demonic power is boundless, daring to fight against heaven.

143
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:30,960
Why are you hiding

144
00:12:31,490 --> 00:12:32,860
now that I'm here?

145
00:12:33,630 --> 00:12:35,030
Wangquan Hongye,

146
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:38,240
are you here to seek death?

147
00:12:39,250 --> 00:12:41,280
You didn't even spare Ye Yuan.

148
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:43,290
You actually took his demon core.

149
00:12:43,560 --> 00:12:47,170
Since when did you have the right to judge me?

150
00:12:48,180 --> 00:12:49,640
How pathetic you are.

151
00:12:53,270 --> 00:12:54,630
Eighteen years ago,

152
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,460
you left the Boundary to fight the Black Fox,

153
00:12:57,600 --> 00:12:59,990
and the Mask Group was nearly wiped out.

154
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:04,020
And all of it

155
00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:07,540
was because of your arrogance.

156
00:13:08,940 --> 00:13:11,160
Aren't you pathetic?

157
00:13:16,740 --> 00:13:19,650
I won't give you another chance.

158
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:09,910
Hongye!

159
00:14:28,370 --> 00:14:30,650
Quzhuo, you're as slow as ever.

160
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,790
You think these old, weak, and wounded people

161
00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:38,650
are worthy of fighting me?

162
00:14:38,910 --> 00:14:39,750
Hongye,

163
00:14:39,980 --> 00:14:40,910
catch the sword!

164
00:14:57,010 --> 00:14:58,170
I'll kill you first.

165
00:15:16,610 --> 00:15:19,810
There's a vast gap in power between us.

166
00:15:19,900 --> 00:15:22,480
So what if you're using Clairvoyance?

167
00:15:57,720 --> 00:15:58,510
Quzhuo!

168
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:00,790
Zui!

169
00:16:05,270 --> 00:16:06,460
Dragon blood?

170
00:16:43,950 --> 00:16:45,320
You fools.

171
00:16:45,590 --> 00:16:48,630
If you hadn't tried to save this crippled old man just now,

172
00:16:48,630 --> 00:16:50,890
you might still have had a chance to live.

173
00:17:25,720 --> 00:17:27,319
But now your sword is broken,

174
00:17:27,319 --> 00:17:29,120
and the dragon's blood is gone.

175
00:17:29,510 --> 00:17:31,360
What can you do now?

176
00:17:36,290 --> 00:17:37,290
Mu Mie.

177
00:17:52,140 --> 00:17:53,340
Miss Cuiyu.

178
00:17:54,790 --> 00:17:56,590
You, a leech demon,

179
00:17:56,610 --> 00:18:00,070
dare to stand against me for them?

180
00:18:00,260 --> 00:18:01,720
As long as I can protect him,

181
00:18:01,720 --> 00:18:04,520
I don't care if I have to stand against even heaven!

182
00:18:09,010 --> 00:18:12,730
You dare use the power of the Golden Dawn against me?

183
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:47,440
Dummy, you're already gravely injured.

184
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:49,310
If you use that move again, it will kill you!

185
00:18:49,310 --> 00:18:49,880
Hurry!

186
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:34,350
Hongye!

187
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:35,510
Hongye!

188
00:19:47,750 --> 00:19:48,590
Dragon blood?

189
00:19:55,970 --> 00:19:57,300
Young Master Wangquan!

190
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:13,350
Unite as one!

191
00:20:13,460 --> 00:20:14,340
Form the array!

192
00:21:35,660 --> 00:21:36,670
Tell me,

193
00:21:36,700 --> 00:21:38,380
what can restrain you?

194
00:21:38,680 --> 00:21:40,120
Dragon bones and dragon blood.

195
00:21:40,120 --> 00:21:42,090
The bane of the Netherworld Clan

196
00:21:42,590 --> 00:21:44,240
is the Dragon Clan.

197
00:21:44,620 --> 00:21:46,430
I see.

198
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:54,330
Do you really think you can win?

199
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:38,110
Huaizhu?

200
00:22:47,260 --> 00:22:48,660
Lord Jiuhuo,

201
00:22:49,240 --> 00:22:51,960
how does it feel

202
00:22:52,590 --> 00:22:53,850
to taste defeat again?

203
00:22:56,640 --> 00:22:58,240
You're not Jia Lan,

204
00:22:58,890 --> 00:23:00,650
nor are you Huaizhu.

205
00:23:01,720 --> 00:23:03,880
You've been plotting all along.

206
00:23:04,510 --> 00:23:06,370
When the mandala flower bloomed,

207
00:23:06,610 --> 00:23:08,840
a new personality formed within you.

208
00:23:11,990 --> 00:23:13,190
Ridiculous.

209
00:23:13,850 --> 00:23:15,250
So ridiculous.

210
00:23:19,240 --> 00:23:20,110
Huaizhu!

211
00:23:28,650 --> 00:23:30,320
Who is your Huaizhu?

212
00:23:45,270 --> 00:23:46,830
Love is a curse.

213
00:23:47,680 --> 00:23:48,680
Love

214
00:23:49,230 --> 00:23:51,470
is the weakness of all of you.

215
00:24:17,960 --> 00:24:18,750
Hongye!

216
00:24:18,750 --> 00:24:19,270
Hongye!

217
00:24:19,270 --> 00:24:20,600
Young Master Wangquan!

218
00:24:23,880 --> 00:24:24,930
Now,

219
00:24:25,040 --> 00:24:29,450
do you still believe that Dongfang Huaizhu still exists?

220
00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:33,470
What exactly do you want to do?

221
00:24:35,110 --> 00:24:36,960
What do I want to do?

222
00:24:38,460 --> 00:24:41,460
I am the bad seed formed from the countless grievances

223
00:24:44,650 --> 00:24:48,710
and resentments gathered from the Grief Tree on Tushan.

224
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:51,070
What do you think

225
00:24:52,030 --> 00:24:53,720
I want to do?

226
00:25:12,730 --> 00:25:14,540
There is goodness in the world,

227
00:25:14,830 --> 00:25:16,490
so why can't there be evil?

228
00:25:17,700 --> 00:25:19,690
Since I was born to be evil,

229
00:25:19,940 --> 00:25:21,940
why must I have love?

230
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:24,730
This is why Jia Lan failed.

231
00:25:25,750 --> 00:25:28,230
Fortunately, I am not her.

232
00:25:31,920 --> 00:25:33,170
You...

233
00:25:34,160 --> 00:25:36,380
You've been lying to me all along.

234
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:40,530
If I hadn't made you believe Dongfang Huaizhu still exists,

235
00:25:40,600 --> 00:25:42,510
how could you have risked your life

236
00:25:42,510 --> 00:25:44,120
to help me get rid of Jiuhuo?

237
00:25:48,770 --> 00:25:50,200
Does it hurt?

238
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:53,350
Then hate me.

239
00:25:58,860 --> 00:26:02,670
Your hatred is my best nourishment.

240
00:26:32,630 --> 00:26:34,800
All demons in the world

241
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:37,310
are at my command.

242
00:26:38,790 --> 00:26:40,270
My servants,

243
00:26:41,850 --> 00:26:45,690
offer yourselves for me.

244
00:27:32,360 --> 00:27:33,940
I am not Jia Lan,

245
00:27:33,960 --> 00:27:36,170
nor am I Dongfang Huaizhu.

246
00:27:38,350 --> 00:27:40,200
I am who I am.

247
00:27:43,320 --> 00:27:46,330
I will be the one and only mandala flower

248
00:27:47,240 --> 00:27:50,960
on the black Grief Tree.

249
00:28:13,510 --> 00:28:14,240
Where are we?

250
00:28:14,310 --> 00:28:15,230
Where am I?

251
00:28:16,920 --> 00:28:17,760
Run!

252
00:28:27,550 --> 00:28:29,080
What are you trying to do?

253
00:28:29,770 --> 00:28:31,300
If we cannot live together,

254
00:28:31,570 --> 00:28:33,370
then let us die together!

255
00:28:34,130 --> 00:28:35,540
I bet

256
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:38,020
