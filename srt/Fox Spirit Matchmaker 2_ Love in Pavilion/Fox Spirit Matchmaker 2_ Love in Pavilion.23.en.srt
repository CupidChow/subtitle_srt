00:01:46,340 --> 00:01:50,780
[Episode 23]

3
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:52,950
Master.

4
00:01:58,940 --> 00:01:59,900
Master, look.

5
00:02:00,470 --> 00:02:01,680
In order to get that flower,

6
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:03,710
our Drunken Dream Tower has already suffered countless casualties.

7
00:02:03,710 --> 00:02:05,640
Then let's organize a Demon Fight.

8
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:07,540
Go out and find some new recruits.

9
00:02:08,030 --> 00:02:09,190
No matter what,

10
00:02:09,590 --> 00:02:11,120
I want the Twilight Mist Flower.

11
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:12,030
Yes, Master.

12
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:15,560
I told you to find Wangquan Hongye's whereabouts.

13
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:17,500
Why is there still no news?

14
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:19,570
We have sent out all spies.

15
00:02:19,570 --> 00:02:21,630
Please wait a little longer, Master.

16
00:02:21,710 --> 00:02:22,970
But even if we find him,

17
00:02:23,310 --> 00:02:25,590
we do not have the skills to kill him.

18
00:02:26,900 --> 00:02:28,920
Of course you guys can't kill him.

19
00:02:29,430 --> 00:02:31,030
But there is someone who can.

20
00:02:31,910 --> 00:02:33,110
Go find them quickly.

21
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:34,590
Yes, Master.

22
00:02:48,390 --> 00:02:49,870
There are assassins!

23
00:02:51,540 --> 00:02:52,760
Who are you?

24
00:03:15,450 --> 00:03:16,120
Let's go.

25
00:03:38,430 --> 00:03:39,520
Ms. Qingmu?

26
00:03:43,980 --> 00:03:44,960
Master Zhang.

27
00:03:45,870 --> 00:03:46,800
Long time no see.

28
00:03:47,460 --> 00:03:48,790
I hope you've been well.

29
00:03:49,550 --> 00:03:50,460
Speak.

30
00:03:51,630 --> 00:03:52,800
What are you doing here?

31
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:54,800
I should be asking you that instead.

32
00:03:55,430 --> 00:03:57,710
You've visited Beast Kingdom three times in the past month.

33
00:03:57,710 --> 00:03:59,170
What exactly are you up to?

34
00:03:59,630 --> 00:04:00,690
I go where I please.

35
00:04:01,910 --> 00:04:02,870
Wherever I go,

36
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:05,490
it's none of your business.

37
00:04:06,590 --> 00:04:09,150
Beast Kingdom is holding a nationwide search for Wangquan Hongye.

38
00:04:09,150 --> 00:04:10,120
Was it you

39
00:04:10,150 --> 00:04:12,950
who leaked this information to Beast Kingdom's ruler?

40
00:04:12,950 --> 00:04:15,010
So Wangquan Hongye has come here too.

41
00:04:15,650 --> 00:04:17,380
Then why are you questioning me

42
00:04:17,730 --> 00:04:19,329
instead of confronting him?

43
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:22,800
Why are you avoiding my questions?

44
00:04:26,780 --> 00:04:27,990
Could it be that...

45
00:04:28,180 --> 00:04:30,830
you've been in contact with Beast Kingdom for a long time now,

46
00:04:30,830 --> 00:04:32,560
plotting something sinister?

47
00:04:33,540 --> 00:04:34,340
What's wrong?

48
00:04:34,930 --> 00:04:36,270
Did I get it right?

49
00:04:36,630 --> 00:04:38,030
Do you want to silence me?

50
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:43,750
Let go.

51
00:04:44,210 --> 00:04:46,270
There are some things I must clarify.

52
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:48,920
Why did you change so drastically after turning 18

53
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:50,060
and refuse to see me ever again?

54
00:04:50,060 --> 00:04:52,320
What exactly happened during that time?

55
00:04:56,300 --> 00:04:57,270
Say something!

56
00:04:58,710 --> 00:04:59,659
Speak up!

57
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,660
What we can be certain of now is

58
00:05:12,190 --> 00:05:14,360
those demons bought at a high price by Drunken Dream Tower's owner

59
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:16,360
have all been sent to retrieve the Twilight Mist Flower.

60
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:17,490
None have returned.

61
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:20,720
This Demon Fight also serves the same purpose.

62
00:05:21,490 --> 00:05:23,190
And the assassin who tried to kill you

63
00:05:23,190 --> 00:05:25,450
was also instructed by this tower owner.

64
00:05:26,310 --> 00:05:27,640
Hongye, Mrs. Wangquan.

65
00:05:28,630 --> 00:05:29,750
While you were at Drunken Dream Tower,

66
00:05:29,750 --> 00:05:31,070
news came from Ruyi Pavilion.

67
00:05:31,070 --> 00:05:34,270
They said the owner of Drunken Dream Tower has been found.

68
00:05:35,870 --> 00:05:38,670
It's the new National Preceptor of Beast Kingdom,

69
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:39,560
Anayan.

70
00:05:43,409 --> 00:05:45,070
National Preceptor, Anayan?

71
00:05:45,190 --> 00:05:47,920
She also wants to obtain the Twilight Mist Flower

72
00:05:48,310 --> 00:05:50,040
and sent an assassin to kill me.

73
00:05:50,750 --> 00:05:52,610
The assassin was also sent by her?

74
00:05:52,750 --> 00:05:55,800
Hongye, let's go to the National Preceptor's Residence to meet her now.

75
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:57,060
That might alert them.

76
00:05:58,430 --> 00:06:01,470
They've sent many spies, searching for you throughout the city.

77
00:06:01,470 --> 00:06:03,470
We can root out this assassin first.

78
00:06:04,700 --> 00:06:05,700
That makes sense.

79
00:06:07,310 --> 00:06:08,370
How will we do that?

80
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:10,360
By turning the bait on the spies.

81
00:06:19,410 --> 00:06:20,810
Why are you following me?

82
00:06:28,630 --> 00:06:30,560
Actually, I'm not afraid of wolves

83
00:06:30,620 --> 00:06:32,020
nor am I afraid of demons.

84
00:06:32,830 --> 00:06:34,830
I'm just a little afraid of the dark.

85
00:06:39,390 --> 00:06:40,450
Afraid of the dark?

86
00:06:41,430 --> 00:06:42,360
Then make a fire.

87
00:06:54,070 --> 00:06:54,870
What's wrong?

88
00:06:59,970 --> 00:07:02,760
My leg... I think it's injured.

89
00:07:12,230 --> 00:07:13,290
What are you doing?

90
00:07:21,870 --> 00:07:25,920
Before I kill you, I want to know the whole truth.

91
00:07:44,270 --> 00:07:45,210
Who are you?

92
00:07:46,710 --> 00:07:47,630
Zhang Zheng.

93
00:07:48,190 --> 00:07:49,870
I'm asking for your real name.

94
00:07:54,390 --> 00:07:55,120
Speak.

95
00:08:00,630 --> 00:08:01,510
A... Na...

96
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:05,450
Ran.

97
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:07,160
So...

98
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:12,380
So you are really a body double

99
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:15,050
Master Zhang bought for the Young Master.

100
00:08:15,270 --> 00:08:16,730
Because you and him...

101
00:08:17,870 --> 00:08:19,320
look exactly the same.

102
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:20,510
Yes.

103
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:24,690
Were you the one who stole his identity

104
00:08:25,510 --> 00:08:27,770
and fooled everyone in the Zhang family?

105
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:30,360
Yes.

106
00:08:32,039 --> 00:08:33,370
What about Zhang Zheng?

107
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:34,789
Where is he?

108
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,000
Dead.

109
00:08:44,870 --> 00:08:45,790
Was it you...

110
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:48,080
who killed him?

111
00:08:52,030 --> 00:08:53,320
Yes, I killed him.

112
00:08:55,870 --> 00:08:57,630
He was such a good person.

113
00:08:58,670 --> 00:09:00,080
How could you kill him?

114
00:09:01,510 --> 00:09:02,670
I'm going to kill you!

115
00:09:02,670 --> 00:09:03,840
Go ahead, kill me.

116
00:09:08,060 --> 00:09:09,490
I'm already exhausted.

117
00:09:14,750 --> 00:09:15,630
Yuan,

118
00:09:17,700 --> 00:09:18,630
I'm sorry.

119
00:09:20,290 --> 00:09:22,420
I can't walk you home at night anymore.

120
00:09:35,690 --> 00:09:36,900
Miss Qingmu,

121
00:09:37,270 --> 00:09:38,400
I'm here to save you.

122
00:09:41,910 --> 00:09:42,700
It was you.

123
00:09:46,690 --> 00:09:49,550
It was you who led me out of the nightmare formation.

124
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:01,050
I want to hear your story with Zhang Zheng.

125
00:10:03,020 --> 00:10:06,540
What exactly happened between you two?

126
00:10:08,110 --> 00:10:09,240
Our Young Master...

127
00:10:14,150 --> 00:10:16,630
He was a very, very nice person.

128
00:10:19,870 --> 00:10:21,000
A little to the left.

129
00:10:22,390 --> 00:10:23,790
Yes, right there.

130
00:10:28,490 --> 00:10:30,350
I heard that at the academy today,

131
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,930
Yuan was caught knocking off again

132
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:35,660
and got punished with copying books.

133
00:10:36,390 --> 00:10:37,380
But don't worry, Young Master,

134
00:10:37,380 --> 00:10:39,440
I helped her copy more than half of it.

135
00:10:40,270 --> 00:10:42,580
She doesn't like to move much,

136
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:45,000
but she has a great appetite.

137
00:10:45,630 --> 00:10:47,750
Today, she actually ate four mooncakes.

138
00:10:47,750 --> 00:10:49,030
She actually ate four?

139
00:10:49,230 --> 00:10:51,150
You really understand her, Young Master.

140
00:10:51,150 --> 00:10:53,060
She doesn't like fancy delicacies,

141
00:10:53,060 --> 00:10:56,190
but loves the five-nut mooncakes from Lao Wu Ji the most.

142
00:10:58,070 --> 00:11:00,610
Why didn't you stay with her longer before coming back?

143
00:11:00,610 --> 00:11:02,010
She's afraid of the dark.

144
00:11:02,270 --> 00:11:04,390
I stayed with her at the academy until she finished her punishment.

145
00:11:04,390 --> 00:11:06,390
I've also made sure to send her home.

146
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:07,410
Come.

147
00:11:09,060 --> 00:11:10,030
That's good.

148
00:11:11,560 --> 00:11:12,970
Yuan has grown up too.

149
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:15,910
Miss Qingmu.

150
00:11:16,670 --> 00:11:19,400
She'll soon be the new mistress of Ruyi Pavilion.

151
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:32,320
Young Master, you will surely be able to spend the Mid-Autumn Festival with her next year.

152
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:33,120
Me?

153
00:11:39,570 --> 00:11:41,970
I won't make it through this winter, will I?

154
00:11:43,510 --> 00:11:44,510
All these years,

155
00:11:46,150 --> 00:11:48,480
thank you for testing the medicine for me,

156
00:11:48,750 --> 00:11:50,280
for appearing on my behalf,

157
00:11:51,070 --> 00:11:52,000
for visiting...

158
00:11:55,730 --> 00:11:56,730
Yuan on my behalf.

159
00:12:12,590 --> 00:12:13,770
If I die,

160
00:12:17,900 --> 00:12:19,600
you will certainly be erased.

161
00:12:22,630 --> 00:12:23,630
I could run away.

162
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:26,520
I've seen you practice swordsmanship.

163
00:12:26,750 --> 00:12:28,350
Your talent is astonishing.

164
00:12:29,270 --> 00:12:30,400
If you wanted to run,

165
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:32,450
you could have done so long ago.

166
00:12:33,080 --> 00:12:34,280
Why didn't you leave?

167
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:44,630
Although you're a person of few words,

168
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,610
you have a soft heart.

169
00:12:49,340 --> 00:12:50,790
You stayed for me.

170
00:12:55,670 --> 00:12:56,600
So...

171
00:12:59,270 --> 00:13:00,240
So I also...

172
00:13:08,390 --> 00:13:10,450
So I also want to do something for you.

173
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:15,640
There's a new bottle of medicine in the drawer.

174
00:13:16,610 --> 00:13:17,680
Go get it.

175
00:13:29,540 --> 00:13:30,170
Come.

176
00:13:31,940 --> 00:13:32,910
Pour it all out.

177
00:13:39,750 --> 00:13:40,270
Water.

178
00:13:59,980 --> 00:14:00,620
I'm tired.

179
00:14:08,090 --> 00:14:10,620
I left you some mooncakes on the table.

180
00:14:11,270 --> 00:14:12,530
Salted ham mooncakes.

181
00:14:14,280 --> 00:14:16,140
I remember you don't like sweets.

182
00:15:02,990 --> 00:15:04,990
On that Mid-Autumn Festival night,

183
00:15:05,980 --> 00:15:07,710
he took Yusu pills.

184
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:13,490
It's a medicine that can bring on a last burst of life,

185
00:15:15,160 --> 00:15:17,020
but will accelerate his death.

186
00:15:20,640 --> 00:15:22,590
He wanted to give me the identity

187
00:15:24,450 --> 00:15:25,510
of Zhang Zheng.

188
00:15:32,210 --> 00:15:33,010
Young Master.

189
00:15:43,850 --> 00:15:46,270
Is it the medication from last time that's working?

190
00:15:46,270 --> 00:15:49,530
Young Master, you can get out of bed now. That's wonderful!

191
00:15:51,520 --> 00:15:52,550
I had someone specially buy

192
00:15:52,550 --> 00:15:54,750
the medicine I took during Mid-Autumn.

193
00:15:54,960 --> 00:15:56,090
It's the Yusu pills.

194
00:15:56,770 --> 00:15:59,030
It can give me an immediate burst of life,

195
00:15:59,370 --> 00:16:02,100
allowing me to move and walk like a normal person.

196
00:16:05,550 --> 00:16:07,350
But it will accelerate my death.

197
00:16:11,690 --> 00:16:13,520
Young Master, why are you doing this?

198
00:16:13,520 --> 00:16:14,590
Because I think...

199
00:16:16,750 --> 00:16:19,680
you are more suitable to be Dark Sword's Zhang Zheng.

200
00:16:22,310 --> 00:16:25,910
Since childhood, I've vowed to become an exceptional swordsman

201
00:16:26,280 --> 00:16:28,540
and carry on the legacy of the Dark Sword.

202
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:34,060
I was once the strongest young swordsman in the Yiqi Alliance.

203
00:17:07,730 --> 00:17:08,530
Young Master!

204
00:17:08,690 --> 00:17:09,450
Stop!

205
00:17:13,030 --> 00:17:13,890
How did you find

206
00:17:15,829 --> 00:17:16,829
my swordmanship?

207
00:17:17,510 --> 00:17:18,349
It was great.

208
00:17:21,530 --> 00:17:22,530
That's good then.

209
00:17:24,200 --> 00:17:25,319
From today on,

210
00:17:27,849 --> 00:17:28,980
I will be you.

211
00:17:30,190 --> 00:17:31,720
You shall stay in this room.

212
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:33,710
I have about 10 days.

213
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:34,940
During this time,

214
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:37,070
you need to gradually transition from

215
00:17:37,070 --> 00:17:39,470
being bedridden to a miraculous recovery.

216
00:17:39,680 --> 00:17:40,610
Young Master...

217
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:41,960
Let's exchange clothes.

218
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:42,760
Young Master!

219
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:53,330
I've already taken the Yusu pills.

220
00:17:54,100 --> 00:17:55,700
There's no turning back now.

221
00:17:59,230 --> 00:18:00,200
It's alright.

222
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:04,170
I have many unfulfilled ambitions

223
00:18:06,330 --> 00:18:08,090
and many regrets.

224
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:10,240
But at least

225
00:18:10,430 --> 00:18:12,230
I'm not dying full of resentment

226
00:18:12,510 --> 00:18:13,960
on a sickbed.

227
00:18:17,590 --> 00:18:18,350
At least...

228
00:18:20,350 --> 00:18:21,350
your life

229
00:18:23,830 --> 00:18:25,000
can continue.

230
00:18:28,630 --> 00:18:29,490
Take the sword.

231
00:19:10,750 --> 00:19:11,590
So...

232
00:19:13,130 --> 00:19:15,790
he voluntarily exchanged identities with you?

233
00:19:17,070 --> 00:19:19,000
Then why did you say you killed him?

234
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:21,670
He died because of me.

235
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:26,680
I killed him.

236
00:19:50,830 --> 00:19:51,640
Who's there?

237
00:20:01,300 --> 00:20:02,550
Greetings, Young Master.

238
00:20:02,550 --> 00:20:03,110
Go away!

239
00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:04,350
Young Master.

240
00:20:04,350 --> 00:20:06,370
This is on the orders of our Master.

241
00:20:06,390 --> 00:20:07,960
Please don't put us in a difficult position.

242
00:20:07,960 --> 00:20:09,270
I need to speak with him for a moment.

243
00:20:09,270 --> 00:20:10,890
But, Young Master...

244
00:20:10,920 --> 00:20:11,750
Go away!

245
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:12,720
Yes.

246
00:20:35,320 --> 00:20:36,410
I'm sorry.

247
00:20:37,960 --> 00:20:39,490
They dragged me here before

248
00:20:40,490 --> 00:20:42,350
I could even wait for your return.

249
00:20:42,500 --> 00:20:43,760
Don't draw your sword.

250
00:20:44,840 --> 00:20:46,300
I got what I wanted.

251
00:20:48,780 --> 00:20:50,440
This is the outcome I desired.

252
00:21:00,450 --> 00:21:02,330
I'm already at the end of my rope.

253
00:21:04,950 --> 00:21:06,190
You know that.

254
00:21:06,310 --> 00:21:07,310
You can't do this.

255
00:21:12,470 --> 00:21:14,800
After taking the Yusu pills,

256
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:17,110
do you know how much pain I had to endure every day

257
00:21:17,110 --> 00:21:18,570
just to make it to this day?

258
00:21:20,350 --> 00:21:22,480
Do you want all my efforts to be in vain?

259
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:25,300
Being buried alive

260
00:21:26,440 --> 00:21:27,590
is very painful.

261
00:21:28,060 --> 00:21:29,320
I really can't do this.

262
00:21:35,050 --> 00:21:37,250
Dying from the effects of the Yusu pills

263
00:21:38,850 --> 00:21:41,180
is a hundred times more painful than this.

264
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:43,250
Why do you never give me a choice?

265
00:21:43,270 --> 00:21:44,960
Give me a chance to stop you.

266
00:21:46,690 --> 00:21:48,140
Because I hope...

267
00:21:50,560 --> 00:21:52,540
that all of this is my own choice.

268
00:21:54,410 --> 00:21:56,030
It has nothing to do with you.

269
00:21:57,160 --> 00:21:58,680
Don't feel guilty.

270
00:22:01,310 --> 00:22:04,830
I hope you can live well.

271
00:22:16,990 --> 00:22:19,920
This is a charm I've carried with me since childhood.

272
00:22:21,920 --> 00:22:23,590
I was always hesitating on

273
00:22:24,510 --> 00:22:26,490
what I should carve for you.

274
00:22:27,700 --> 00:22:29,500
I almost couldn't give it to you.

275
00:22:35,020 --> 00:22:36,030
It's a clivia.

276
00:22:39,100 --> 00:22:40,690
It's not well-carved.

277
00:22:56,500 --> 00:22:57,910
From today on,

278
00:23:00,390 --> 00:23:02,250
you are Dark Sword's Zhang Zheng.

279
00:23:03,920 --> 00:23:05,680
Take good care of my clivia.

280
00:23:08,510 --> 00:23:09,960
Take care of yourself.

281
00:23:14,270 --> 00:23:15,930
Take care of the Zhang family.

282
00:23:26,070 --> 00:23:27,480
Let go.

283
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:30,400
Do you want all my efforts

284
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:31,550
to be in vain?

285
00:23:42,110 --> 00:23:44,310
If you insist on feeling indebted to me,

286
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:48,960
living your life well

287
00:23:50,850 --> 00:23:52,980
is the only repayment I can think of.

288
00:24:13,640 --> 00:24:15,110
Help me put on the hood.

289
00:24:18,430 --> 00:24:20,640
They're just following orders.

290
00:24:20,680 --> 00:24:22,270
If they see my face,

291
00:24:24,660 --> 00:24:25,790
it'll be dangerous.

292
00:25:20,930 --> 00:25:22,720
It's time to say goodbye.

293
00:25:30,600 --> 00:25:32,750
I hope Dark Sword's Zhang Zheng

294
00:25:33,920 --> 00:25:36,050
will be a decisive person.

295
00:26:14,070 --> 00:26:15,930
Are you entrusted by Young Master

296
00:26:16,560 --> 00:26:18,090
to take care of Qingmu Yuan?

297
00:26:19,960 --> 00:26:20,880
Yes.

298
00:26:25,860 --> 00:26:26,930
Then why...

299
00:26:28,590 --> 00:26:30,720
after you became the real Zhang Zheng,

300
00:26:33,090 --> 00:26:34,820
you were ignoring Qingmu Yuan?

301
00:26:40,390 --> 00:26:42,920
Is it because Young Master liked Qingmu Yuan,

302
00:26:43,740 --> 00:26:45,200
and you dare not overstep?

303
00:26:47,270 --> 00:26:48,200
Yes.

304
00:26:50,360 --> 00:26:51,960
Then do you like Qingmu Yuan?

305
00:26:58,890 --> 00:27:01,180
Zhang Zheng, what's wrong with you?

306
00:27:01,640 --> 00:27:02,510
Zhang Zheng.

307
00:27:04,160 --> 00:27:05,580
Why is your face so hot?

308
00:27:06,350 --> 00:27:09,700
The smoke and formation should be harmless.

309
00:27:10,110 --> 00:27:10,920
Zhang Zheng.

310
00:27:11,390 --> 00:27:12,180
Zhang Zheng!

311
00:27:44,750 --> 00:27:46,950
Fortunately, I brought my Qiankun Bag.

312
00:27:47,240 --> 00:27:49,100
I've finally healed your wounds.

313
00:27:51,960 --> 00:27:52,960
I like.

314
00:27:58,550 --> 00:27:59,510
What do you like?

315
00:28:01,830 --> 00:28:03,480
I like Qingmu Yuan.

316
00:28:07,820 --> 00:28:09,370
Such quick response,

317
00:28:09,550 --> 00:28:11,280
just like when you were a child.

318
00:28:18,470 --> 00:28:21,600
Then let me ask you a question.

319
00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:27,790
Can Zhang Zheng and Qingmu Yuan be together forever?

320
00:28:29,030 --> 00:28:29,750
No.

321
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:32,690
Why not?

322
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:34,660
I'll ask you again.

323
00:28:34,680 --> 00:28:35,880
Answer me carefully.

324
00:28:36,680 --> 00:28:40,160
Can Zhang Zheng and Qingmu Yuan be together forever?

325
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:43,720
No.

326
00:28:44,070 --> 00:28:45,000
Why not?

327
00:29:00,490 --> 00:29:01,740
Right now...

328
00:29:02,940 --> 00:29:04,380
you're in a dream.

329
00:29:05,870 --> 00:29:07,070
In this dream,

330
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:11,170

My Lady, breakfast is ready.

358
00:31:34,050 --> 00:31:36,680
My Lady, why are you up so early today?

359
00:31:44,960 --> 00:31:48,640
My Lady... did you go and meet Master Zhang Zheng?

360
00:31:49,750 --> 00:31:50,510
I did.

361
00:31:53,880 --> 00:31:54,910
I also got to know

362
00:31:55,680 --> 00:31:57,010
he has never let me down.

363
00:31:58,270 --> 00:32:01,550
Then... why do you look so troubled?

364
00:32:03,400 --> 00:32:05,060
Because I finally understand

365
00:32:05,490 --> 00:32:07,420
why Zhang Zhe became who he is today

366
00:32:07,830 --> 00:32:09,400
after he turned 18.

367
00:32:10,540 --> 00:32:12,730
Why did he suppress all his desires

368
00:32:13,350 --> 00:32:14,880
and live like an ascetic?

369
00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:18,510
Why he doesn't rest or sleep,

370
00:32:19,240 --> 00:32:23,040
and in just five years, mastered the second-best sword in the world?

371
00:32:23,920 --> 00:32:24,830
Why...

372
00:32:26,650 --> 00:32:28,240
he refuses to see me again?

373
00:32:28,830 --> 00:32:29,830
So why?

374
00:32:33,440 --> 00:32:36,510
Because someone sacrificed everything for him,

375
00:32:38,030 --> 00:32:40,160
but that instead became his shackles.

376
00:32:41,020 --> 00:32:43,730
He feels he cannot enjoy life,

377
00:32:44,760 --> 00:32:46,310
cannot stop running,

378
00:32:47,350 --> 00:32:48,680
and cannot let down

379
00:32:50,310 --> 00:32:52,240
that person's past expectations.

380
00:32:53,710 --> 00:32:55,410
But the most infuriating thing is,

381
00:32:55,410 --> 00:32:56,690
there is someone

382
00:32:57,200 --> 00:32:59,240
who wants to use this secret to blackmail him,

383
00:32:59,240 --> 00:33:01,770
forcing him to do things he doesn't want to do.

384
00:33:08,030 --> 00:33:09,110
Just kill me.

385
00:33:14,270 --> 00:33:15,790
I'm already exhausted.

386
00:33:20,110 --> 00:33:22,770
Miss Huaizhu, Master Zhang requests to see you.

387
00:33:24,590 --> 00:33:26,320
He is finally willing to see me?

388
00:33:33,960 --> 00:33:36,350
Master Zhang, you are indeed a rare guest.

389
00:33:42,520 --> 00:33:46,160
[Those who love you will want you to live for yourself.]

390
00:33:46,790 --> 00:33:47,750
Great words.

391
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:49,000
As expected of me.

392
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:51,400
What exactly did you do to me last night?

393
00:33:52,350 --> 00:33:53,790
Watch your words.

394
00:33:54,640 --> 00:33:56,800
You had a high fever last night and suddenly fainted.

395
00:33:56,800 --> 00:33:58,530
Of course, I gave you medicine.

396
00:33:58,600 --> 00:33:59,320
That's all?

397
00:34:00,270 --> 00:34:01,270
If not, what else?

398
00:34:02,790 --> 00:34:04,190
Then why, after I woke up,

399
00:34:05,240 --> 00:34:07,290
I can't seem to remember many things?

400
00:34:07,290 --> 00:34:09,420
That was an intoxicant made by Quzhuo.

401
00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:10,980
It's only natural you don't remember anything

402
00:34:10,980 --> 00:34:12,440
after being intoxicated.

403
00:34:12,630 --> 00:34:13,510
Ms. Qingmu.

404
00:34:15,400 --> 00:34:17,659
You had such a high fever last night,

405
00:34:18,070 --> 00:34:20,710
isn't it normal to forget some things?

406
00:34:23,080 --> 00:34:24,900
[Those who love you will want you to live for yourself.]

407
00:34:23,710 --> 00:34:25,110
Then what does this mean?

408
00:34:32,429 --> 00:34:34,730
How many years has it been since

409
00:34:35,370 --> 00:34:36,830
since we were classmates?

410
00:34:42,880 --> 00:34:45,239
Why are you bringing up something pointless?

411
00:34:45,239 --> 00:34:46,730
When we were classmates,

412
00:34:46,920 --> 00:34:48,650
you were also a man of few words,

413
00:34:49,690 --> 00:34:52,090
but at the very least, you were living life.

414
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:54,600
What exactly happened to you

415
00:34:55,360 --> 00:34:57,220
that made you abandon all desires

416
00:34:57,590 --> 00:34:59,150
and live like an ascetic?

417
00:35:00,230 --> 00:35:01,070
What exactly?

418
00:35:13,320 --> 00:35:14,320
Those who love you

419
00:35:15,190 --> 00:35:17,120
will want you to live for yourself.

420
00:35:18,150 --> 00:35:19,510
The meaning is literal.

421
00:35:21,520 --> 00:35:22,490
Qingmu Yuan.

422
00:35:23,070 --> 00:35:24,630
Is it fun to tease me?

423
00:35:25,030 --> 00:35:26,960
Not calling me Ms. Qingmu anymore?

424
00:35:37,070 --> 00:35:38,280
I'm not teasing you.

425
00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:41,440
As classmates, we are also friends.

426
00:35:43,230 --> 00:35:44,400
I hope you...

427
00:35:45,710 --> 00:35:46,970
can live for yourself.

428
00:35:58,880 --> 00:35:59,760
Goodbye.

429
00:36:06,190 --> 00:36:06,920
Zhang Zheng.

430
00:36:07,670 --> 00:36:08,360
I'm sorry

431
00:36:10,030 --> 00:36:12,920
for uncovering your scars without your consent.

432
00:36:14,230 --> 00:36:15,550
I will keep this secret

433
00:36:16,550 --> 00:36:19,030
until I help you overcome all obstacles.

434
00:36:28,660 --> 00:36:30,860
The message from Prince Bumu to Hongye.

435
00:36:31,190 --> 00:36:32,840
This dessert shop below

436
00:36:32,860 --> 00:36:35,060
is the base of the National Preceptor's spies.

437
00:36:35,060 --> 00:36:37,190
Then which ones do you think are spies?

438
00:36:37,960 --> 00:36:40,080
Is it the beautiful Madam,

439
00:36:40,760 --> 00:36:43,000
or the one who drank eight bowls of dessert

440
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:45,000
and has never moved from their seat?

441
00:36:46,230 --> 00:36:46,880
Puppy Li.

442
00:36:47,440 --> 00:36:48,800
Call me sister

443
00:36:48,840 --> 00:36:50,770
and I'll tell you who the spies are.

444
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:52,670
You?

445
00:36:53,510 --> 00:36:54,640
I don't believe you.

446
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:57,680
Since I was a child, I've been following Huaizhu to collect herbs and heal the sick.

447
00:36:57,680 --> 00:36:59,430
I've seen all sorts of people.

448
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:01,840
No one can escape my discerning eye.

449
00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:04,320
Come on, call me sister

450
00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:05,930
and I'll analyze it for you.

451
00:37:07,810 --> 00:37:08,400
Sister.

452
00:37:08,590 --> 00:37:09,320
Beg me.

453
00:37:15,760 --> 00:37:16,800
Please.

454
00:37:19,320 --> 00:37:20,200
Look.

455
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:23,800
That man who drank eight bowls of dessert

456
00:37:24,140 --> 00:37:26,680
has been staring at that beautiful Madam.

457
00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:28,680
He's probably just a womanizer.

458
00:37:29,920 --> 00:37:31,500
As for that Madam,

459
00:37:31,590 --> 00:37:32,850
she's very beautiful,

460
00:37:33,280 --> 00:37:35,510
yet she's running a small dessert shop.

461
00:37:35,630 --> 00:37:37,030
It is indeed suspicious.

462
00:37:37,230 --> 00:37:38,440
But have you noticed that

463
00:37:38,440 --> 00:37:40,170
she has never stood up?

464
00:37:42,440 --> 00:37:44,420
There's something wrong with her left leg.

465
00:37:44,420 --> 00:37:45,740
She's disabled.

466
00:37:46,030 --> 00:37:47,560
Then it can't be her either.

467
00:37:48,300 --> 00:37:50,630
The most suspicious ones in the whole shop

468
00:37:50,650 --> 00:37:52,650
are actually those two assistants.

469
00:37:53,530 --> 00:37:54,400
Two bowls of dessert!

470
00:37:54,400 --> 00:37:56,440
One of them is always slacking off.

471
00:37:56,600 --> 00:37:58,130
It's such a small shop.

472
00:37:58,190 --> 00:38:00,110
Even if it's profitable every day,

473
00:38:00,110 --> 00:38:02,640
can she really afford to hire two assistants?

474
00:38:03,690 --> 00:38:06,760
Maybe he's the Madam's demon?

475
00:38:06,780 --> 00:38:08,710
What kind of demon dares to be lazy?

476
00:38:09,940 --> 00:38:11,080
Let's go, Puppy Li.

477
00:38:11,190 --> 00:38:12,440
Let's go down and meet him.
