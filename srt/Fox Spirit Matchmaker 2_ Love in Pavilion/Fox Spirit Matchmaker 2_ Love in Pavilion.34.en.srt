00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,130
This is Puppy Li's farewell gift to me.

Listen to me.

14
00:02:47,030 --> 00:02:48,360
Father is gone.

15
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:51,120
You have to leave.

16
00:02:54,710 --> 00:02:55,640
I'm not leaving!

17
00:02:56,680 --> 00:02:58,010
I'm going to avenge him!

we're just waiting to die.

20
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:05,960
You must go.

21
00:03:06,710 --> 00:03:08,040
Then let's go together.

22
00:03:16,370 --> 00:03:18,070
I found these

23
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:21,030
in your room a while ago.

24
00:03:23,990 --> 00:03:25,450
I'm returning them to you.

25
00:03:27,430 --> 00:03:28,400
Sorry, Qinlan.

26
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:31,120
I was too strict

27
00:03:32,410 --> 00:03:33,630
with you before.

28
00:03:36,150 --> 00:03:36,960
From now on,

29
00:03:38,090 --> 00:03:40,620
only remember
the good things about me, okay?

30
00:03:45,030 --> 00:03:46,240
These two candies—

31
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:48,430
one was meant for you.

32
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:52,420
You said
the candied hawthorn was too sweet.

33
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:55,030
So I thought the sour and sweet hawthorn

34
00:03:55,310 --> 00:03:57,030
might be to your liking.

35
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:11,090

Qinlan,

37
00:04:13,590 --> 00:04:16,560
you'll stay this wild, fiery,

38
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:17,950

39

Huaizhu,

40
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:23,800
I could never leave you behind.

41

After you go out,

42
00:04:28,950 --> 00:04:30,150
you can call for help.

43
00:04:32,070 --> 00:04:34,190
Yes, I can go find Hongye.

44
00:04:37,159 --> 00:04:39,020
Hongye went beyond the Boundary.

45
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:41,220
We don't know if he's still alive.

46
00:04:44,390 --> 00:04:46,050
Then I can go to Ruyi Pavilion.

47
00:04:46,070 --> 00:04:47,560
It has many branches.

48
00:04:50,290 --> 00:04:52,420

49

But remember,

50
00:04:57,280 --> 00:04:58,430
your safety

51
00:04:59,310 --> 00:05:01,710
matters more than delivering the message.

53

You led them all to their deaths.

74
00:07:48,190 --> 00:07:50,970

Are you entrusting your talismans to me

82

or entrusting me to your talismans?

do exactly as I say.

376
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:51,380
Today,

377
00:28:52,800 --> 00:28:54,590
we didn't see Miss Qinlan.

378
00:28:55,720 --> 00:28:56,250
Let's go.

379
00:29:34,070 --> 00:29:35,590
It's finally the end.

380
00:29:37,620 --> 00:29:38,480
Qinlan.

381
00:29:39,880 --> 00:29:40,810
Are you alright?

382
00:29:43,240 --> 00:29:44,000
And...

383
00:29:45,830 --> 00:29:46,310
you.

384
00:29:49,360 --> 00:29:55,230
[On July 7th, Bamboo Pavilion by River Huai]

385
00:29:54,610 --> 00:29:55,410
Young Master,

386
00:29:56,250 --> 00:29:59,090
the Wangquan Manor
can't go a single day without a leader.

387
00:29:59,090 --> 00:30:00,820
Since you've returned safely,

388
00:30:01,940 --> 00:30:05,330
I think it's time to arrange a ceremony

389
00:30:05,650 --> 00:30:08,570
to announce you as the family master.

390
00:30:12,030 --> 00:30:12,830
Young Master,

391
00:30:13,770 --> 00:30:16,530
even if you don't care about yourself,

392
00:30:16,790 --> 00:30:20,380
won't you at least consider Miss Huaizhu?

393
00:30:22,030 --> 00:30:24,110
The moment you returned injured,

394
00:30:24,400 --> 00:30:25,930
I immediately sent someone

395
00:30:26,070 --> 00:30:28,640
to deliver word to the Divine Fire Villa.

396
00:30:30,200 --> 00:30:31,640
But the messenger

397
00:30:32,350 --> 00:30:34,270
didn't see Miss Huaizhu.

398
00:30:45,300 --> 00:30:46,590
Catch Dongfang Huaizhu!

399
00:30:46,590 --> 00:30:47,510
Don't let her escape!

400
00:30:47,510 --> 00:30:48,640
Go! Go!

401
00:31:10,400 --> 00:31:11,900
Junior Huaizhu,

402
00:31:11,960 --> 00:31:14,110
why do you have to be so stubborn?

403
00:31:13,500 --> 00:31:14,540
[Serenity and Purpose]

404
00:31:14,860 --> 00:31:18,060
The Divine Fire Villa
has long submitted to my authority.

405
00:31:19,660 --> 00:31:22,440
What can you alone possibly change?

406
00:31:23,880 --> 00:31:25,970
The wise know when to go with the flow.

407
00:31:26,750 --> 00:31:29,720
Junior Huaizhu, be good and surrender.

408
00:31:30,030 --> 00:31:31,890
You killed your master for power.

409
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:34,860
Ungrateful and treacherous.

410
00:31:36,270 --> 00:31:38,000
You despicable wretch!

411
00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:40,690
Winners rule, and losers fall.

412
00:31:41,510 --> 00:31:43,240
What's despicable about that?

413
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:45,370
You've really made me speechless.

414
00:31:45,650 --> 00:31:46,510
While I was distracted,

415
00:31:46,510 --> 00:31:48,440
you secretly sent Qinlan out.

416
00:31:49,540 --> 00:31:50,790
But that's fine.

417
00:31:51,160 --> 00:31:53,310
I'm not in a rush to find her.

418
00:31:53,440 --> 00:31:55,320
Because what I care about more

419
00:31:55,680 --> 00:31:56,590
is you.

420
00:31:57,200 --> 00:31:58,550
Shameless!

421
00:32:16,230 --> 00:32:17,880
Junior Huaizhu,

422
00:32:18,110 --> 00:32:19,970
you're at your limit, aren't you?

423
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:22,070
We're fellow disciples,

424
00:32:22,070 --> 00:32:23,860
so I've gone easy on you.

425
00:32:23,920 --> 00:32:25,740
I didn't even use the strong poison.

426
00:32:25,740 --> 00:32:27,960
But soon, you'll lose too much blood,

427
00:32:28,330 --> 00:32:29,830
your mind will start to blur,

428
00:32:29,830 --> 00:32:32,160
and your limbs will stop listening to you.

429
00:32:32,430 --> 00:32:33,670
Before long,

430
00:32:33,690 --> 00:32:36,370
my lifelong wish will come true.

431
00:32:38,180 --> 00:32:39,750
From now on,

432
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:42,030
you'll be mine.

433
00:32:58,680 --> 00:33:03,110
My mind is starting to blur.

434
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:06,070
I can't

435
00:33:06,530 --> 00:33:07,870
lift my hands anymore.

436
00:33:10,910 --> 00:33:12,880
I really miss River Huai

437
00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:16,050
and that bamboo forest.

438
00:33:22,770 --> 00:33:24,570
I truly wish

439
00:33:25,160 --> 00:33:26,200
to see you again,

440
00:33:28,160 --> 00:33:29,790
to see you above the clouds

441
00:33:30,260 --> 00:33:31,330
and come back to me.

442
00:33:36,460 --> 00:33:37,690
When you come back,

443
00:33:38,270 --> 00:33:41,110
we still have so many things to do together.

444
00:33:41,590 --> 00:33:42,920
Wait for me to come back.

445
00:34:11,630 --> 00:34:12,770
What's going on?

446
00:34:12,920 --> 00:34:14,719
The gates have been struck open!

447
00:34:15,320 --> 00:34:16,510
That sword energy...
