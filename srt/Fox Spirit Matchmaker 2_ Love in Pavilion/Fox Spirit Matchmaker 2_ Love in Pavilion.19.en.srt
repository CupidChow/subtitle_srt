[Virtues and Responsibilities]

4
00:01:52,350 --> 00:01:54,590
Alright, let's have a fire duel then.

5
00:01:56,229 --> 00:01:57,960
Master, please be our witness.

6
00:02:16,340 --> 00:02:17,270
Junior Huaizhu,

7
00:02:17,910 --> 00:02:20,040
you have mastered the Pure Yang Flame?

8
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:23,030
Master!

9
00:02:23,910 --> 00:02:26,400
Now that Junior Huaizhu
has got the hang of the Pure Yang Flame,

10
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:27,600
the Divine Fire Villa

11
00:02:27,910 --> 00:02:30,780
no longer needs to
yield to the Wangquan Sword!

12
00:02:30,870 --> 00:02:32,590
Stop talking nonsense.

13
00:02:38,690 --> 00:02:39,840
Renfeng,

14
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:42,960
considering you haven't

15
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:45,079
actually killed those demons,

16
00:02:45,880 --> 00:02:48,350
I order you to send
the demons in the cellar

17
00:02:48,380 --> 00:02:50,660
back to their own clans personally.

18
00:02:50,970 --> 00:02:53,760
After that, take some time to introspect.

19
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:56,480
Don't cause any more trouble.

20
00:02:59,000 --> 00:02:59,900
Yes, Master.

21
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:03,280
Disciples of the Divine Fire Villa,
heed my instruction.

22
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:04,150
Yes, Master.

23
00:03:04,710 --> 00:03:06,770
Always have compassion in your heart

24
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:08,750
and help people in need.

25
00:03:09,380 --> 00:03:11,110
Never meddle in mortal affairs

26
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:14,090
and be a good man.

27
00:03:15,030 --> 00:03:15,950
Yes, Master!

28
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:38,829
Thinking about your Miss Huaizhu again?

29
00:03:46,590 --> 00:03:49,440
I heard she scolded you today.

30
00:03:50,690 --> 00:03:52,850
I thought you'd be pissed off.

31
00:03:56,670 --> 00:03:58,620
That's because you didn't see

32
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:02,400
the beauty and power
of that Pure Yang Flame.

33
00:04:05,550 --> 00:04:06,700
This fire

34
00:04:08,150 --> 00:04:09,150
matches her well.

35
00:04:18,070 --> 00:04:18,800
Xiaotan,

36
00:04:19,350 --> 00:04:21,740
you use your unique secret technique
to absorb demonic energy

37
00:04:21,740 --> 00:04:23,870
and help me cultivate the Divine Fire.

38
00:04:23,870 --> 00:04:25,200
Although it works a bit,

39
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:26,920
I feel it's still not enough.

40
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,430
Is there a better way?

41
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:33,909
There is,

42
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:36,620
but it's not time to tell you yet.

43
00:04:36,650 --> 00:04:37,440
What?

44
00:04:38,090 --> 00:04:39,150
You don't trust me?

45
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:41,070
Should I trust you?

46
00:04:41,750 --> 00:04:44,870
You're still hung up on Dongfang Huaizhu.

47
00:04:48,430 --> 00:04:49,490
Having you with me,

48
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,159
I've already lost interest in her.

49
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:55,950
Is that so?

50
00:04:56,860 --> 00:04:59,510
But there's been a rumor among us demons,

51
00:05:00,270 --> 00:05:02,470
saying that female Dongfangs

52
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:06,080
are the real foundation
of the Spiritual Blood inheritance.

53
00:05:09,390 --> 00:05:11,800
That's nonsense. Don't believe it.

54
00:05:16,250 --> 00:05:17,850
I don't care what you think.

55
00:05:18,510 --> 00:05:20,620
Anyway, I belong to you now.

56
00:05:20,830 --> 00:05:24,030
We demons of the Leech Clan
are all stubborn.

57
00:05:26,070 --> 00:05:27,910
You must not fail me.

58
00:05:30,390 --> 00:05:31,430
Xiaotan,

59
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:33,610
you're the last one I'd ever fail.

60
00:05:34,010 --> 00:05:35,370
You are my treasure.

61
00:05:47,250 --> 00:05:48,570
What is this?

62
00:05:49,470 --> 00:05:52,010
It's completely burnt.
Why are you keeping this?

63
00:05:52,010 --> 00:05:53,650
It might come in handy one day.

64
00:05:53,650 --> 00:05:54,380
Don't mind it.

65
00:05:54,380 --> 00:05:55,909
It's none of your business.

66
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:08,980
Aren't you afraid of people finding out?

67
00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:12,240
This is my private residence.
I'm the boss here.

68
00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:34,450
You were a vessel

69
00:06:34,470 --> 00:06:36,990
your mother prepared for Jia Lan.

70
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:40,430
Everything your mother, Jiang Juanxue, did

71
00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:43,810
was to find a new body for Jia Lan.

72
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:45,310
That turns out

73
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:47,510
to be Dongfang Huaizhu.

74
00:06:55,540 --> 00:06:59,780
So that's Jiang Juanxue's daughter?

75
00:07:01,410 --> 00:07:04,340
Very good. I like this vessel.

76
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:47,080
What on earth is this?

77
00:08:05,570 --> 00:08:06,850
Who are you?

78
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:09,720
Why do you have my magical artifact?

79
00:08:11,230 --> 00:08:12,280
I know who you are.

80
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:14,900
The celestial demon, Jiuhuo.

81
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:16,510
I also know that

82
00:08:16,640 --> 00:08:18,450
you're from 20 years later.

83
00:08:18,530 --> 00:08:19,950
You can't come over now.

84
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:22,900
As long as you use my way

85
00:08:23,070 --> 00:08:24,730
to fix the golden lotus for me,

86
00:08:24,830 --> 00:08:26,430
I will be able to return.

87
00:08:27,590 --> 00:08:28,620
Ridiculous.

88
00:08:29,670 --> 00:08:31,000
Why would I even do that?

89
00:08:32,030 --> 00:08:33,690
Be my underling

90
00:08:33,750 --> 00:08:35,630
and help me accomplish my grand plan.

91
00:08:35,630 --> 00:08:37,890
I'll surely grant you the highest merit.

92
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:42,120
Who does he think he can fool
with mere sweet talk?

93
00:08:42,970 --> 00:08:44,169
Smart one,

94
00:08:44,870 --> 00:08:47,130
you have plenty of time to think about it.

95
00:08:47,510 --> 00:08:48,770
Just think it through.

96
00:09:29,870 --> 00:09:31,510
It's been almost five months.

97
00:09:31,510 --> 00:09:33,130
You still don't look pregnant.

98
00:09:33,130 --> 00:09:34,660
Aren't you a bit too skinny?

99
00:09:35,750 --> 00:09:37,120
I'm eating well.

100
00:09:38,840 --> 00:09:41,700
It's just that I've been
craving spicy food lately.

101
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:44,170
Sour for a boy, spicy for a girl.

102
00:09:44,630 --> 00:09:47,160
You're probably going to have
a little niece.

103
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:51,390
Actually,

104
00:09:52,670 --> 00:09:55,600
a little nephew would be nice too.

105
00:09:57,720 --> 00:09:58,780
What should I do?

106
00:09:59,750 --> 00:10:02,320
I've only been thinking of girl names.

107
00:10:16,870 --> 00:10:17,790
Yan,

108
00:10:19,790 --> 00:10:22,720
I promise I'll keep you and your child
safe and sound.

109
00:10:34,630 --> 00:10:35,550
Hongye,

110
00:10:35,870 --> 00:10:38,800
are you still sad about
not taking good care of Mu Mie?

111
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:40,620
Given that situation,

112
00:10:41,710 --> 00:10:43,440
it's not your fault, actually.

113
00:10:46,750 --> 00:10:49,670
Regretting and grieving
can't make up for anything.

114
00:10:49,670 --> 00:10:51,800
We will definitely change all of this.

115
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:55,820
Yitan, let's go to the Sky-breaking Temple.

116
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:04,960
Dad, Dad.

117
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:07,510
Dad.

118
00:11:07,510 --> 00:11:08,670
Here, take this.

119
00:11:08,750 --> 00:11:09,630
Thank you, sir.

120
00:11:18,980 --> 00:11:19,990
Let me do it.

121
00:11:21,590 --> 00:11:22,470
Take it slow.

122
00:11:24,830 --> 00:11:26,400
Here, this is for you.

123
00:11:27,960 --> 00:11:29,000
Thank you.

124
00:11:29,870 --> 00:11:31,150
Thank you.

125
00:11:52,530 --> 00:11:54,130
The Black Fox has descended.

126
00:11:54,590 --> 00:11:56,390
The eternal night has befallen.

127
00:11:56,930 --> 00:11:58,220
This Sky City

128
00:11:59,140 --> 00:12:01,070
has been turned into a living hell.

129
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:06,440
Wonder how much longer
we can keep protecting them.

130
00:12:07,780 --> 00:12:09,570
As long as we can.

131
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:16,120
No matter what,

132
00:12:16,890 --> 00:12:18,220
thank you for saving me.

133
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:23,730
This...

134
00:12:25,270 --> 00:12:26,600
I'm returning it to you.

135
00:12:31,850 --> 00:12:33,180
When she was still here,

136
00:12:33,690 --> 00:12:36,890
she kept nourishing this wreath
with her demonic energy,

137
00:12:37,270 --> 00:12:40,600
treating it as the most precious treasure
in the world.

138
00:12:48,870 --> 00:12:49,750
Dummy!

139
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:53,550
Next time,

140
00:12:53,660 --> 00:12:56,120
could you give me gifts
that are easy to keep?

141
00:13:03,150 --> 00:13:06,120
Look at you, still so tongue-tied as ever.

142
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:08,450
I'll like anything you give me.

143
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:16,120
Don't cry, Dummy.

144
00:13:16,760 --> 00:13:18,530
My life might be

145
00:13:18,870 --> 00:13:20,240
like a flash in the pan.

146
00:13:21,540 --> 00:13:22,610
But having met you,

147
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:25,260
bickered with you,

148
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,530
and fallen in love with you,

149
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:31,760
I have no regrets at all.

150
00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:48,970
The vigor of this flower wreath

151
00:13:49,370 --> 00:13:51,430
was preserved by her demonic energy.

152
00:13:52,410 --> 00:13:53,600
Since she's gone,

153
00:13:56,510 --> 00:13:58,150
all of this will be gone too.

154
00:14:06,690 --> 00:14:07,790
Miss Cuiyu,

155
00:14:09,390 --> 00:14:12,540
you are so kind and gentle.

156
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:13,200
And...

157
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:13,960
Mr. Mu,

158
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:16,900
after we get through this ordeal,

159
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:18,440
let's

160
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:21,760
part ways.

161
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:05,170
It's been a while
since our last formal assembly.

162
00:15:10,630 --> 00:15:13,900
Let's bet on who'll be the last
to arrive today.

163
00:15:14,350 --> 00:15:16,700
No need to bet. It's definitely Qingmu.

164
00:15:16,790 --> 00:15:18,910
She always sleeps in
for her beauty rest until noon.

165
00:15:18,910 --> 00:15:21,340
From now on, we'll offer no discounts
on all the gems your Li family uses

166
00:15:21,340 --> 00:15:22,600
for magical artifacts

167
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:23,630
Qingmu, welcome!

168
00:15:23,670 --> 00:15:24,200
Hi, Zui.

169
00:15:25,910 --> 00:15:27,530
it's been such a long and hurried journey.

170
00:15:27,530 --> 00:15:28,560
I'm exhausted.

171
00:15:28,590 --> 00:15:29,450
Take a rest now.

172
00:15:31,280 --> 00:15:32,030
Hongye.

173
00:15:32,790 --> 00:15:34,510
Even Qingmu has arrived.

174
00:15:34,920 --> 00:15:37,090
Where are Zizai and Qiyue?

175
00:15:37,270 --> 00:15:37,910
Yeah!

176
00:15:38,790 --> 00:15:40,440
My brother's always punctual.

177
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:41,750
Hongye ordered me and Qiyue

178
00:15:41,750 --> 00:15:43,270
to gather evidence from several places.

179
00:15:43,270 --> 00:15:45,060
That's why we're late. Sorry.

180

[Deng Qiyue from Mask Group]

181
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:47,270
Qiyue,

182
00:15:47,870 --> 00:15:51,590
you've finished investigating
the Western Regions and come back?

183
00:15:51,590 --> 00:15:52,970
The so-called "Immovable Mountain"

184
00:15:52,970 --> 00:15:54,680
actually moves pretty fast!

185
00:15:55,080 --> 00:15:56,530
I was right near it.

186
00:15:57,040 --> 00:15:58,780
OK, let's get down to the business.

187
00:15:58,780 --> 00:16:00,710
Qiyue, you go first.

188
00:16:01,310 --> 00:16:03,390
The information I got in the Western Regions

189
00:16:03,390 --> 00:16:05,610
is pretty much the same as what you all know.

190
00:16:05,610 --> 00:16:08,110
From Nanchui to Tianmen Pass,

191
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:10,440
[Nanchui] [Western Regions]

192
00:16:08,230 --> 00:16:09,900
a huge chasm has been formed.

193
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:11,290
And these chasms

194
00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:13,050
have created a humongous barrier,

195
00:16:13,050 --> 00:16:15,460
[Nanchui]

196
00:16:13,670 --> 00:16:15,360
allowing no demons in or out.

197
00:16:16,460 --> 00:16:17,460
It's the Boundary

198
00:16:17,700 --> 00:16:19,230
drawn by the Third Young Master

199
00:16:19,230 --> 00:16:21,130
of the Aolai Kingdom to keep
the Black Fox out.

200
00:16:21,130 --> 00:16:22,710
So what exactly did you see

201
00:16:23,030 --> 00:16:24,830
in the future, 20 years from now?

202
00:16:26,340 --> 00:16:28,340
The Golden Dawn will break the Boundary.

203
00:16:28,340 --> 00:16:29,600
Black Fox will show up.

204
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:32,130
And eternal night will befall.

205
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:34,840
Hongye,

206
00:16:35,660 --> 00:16:36,720
20 years later,

207
00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:38,610
will our Mask Group members

208
00:16:39,190 --> 00:16:40,920
really all be wiped out?

209
00:16:42,310 --> 00:16:43,950
Zizai, me!

210
00:16:44,670 --> 00:16:45,870
I will still be alive.

211
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:57,680
Having returned from the future 20 years later,

212
00:16:57,680 --> 00:16:59,340
we can surely change all this.

213
00:16:59,750 --> 00:17:02,450
Can the future really be changed?

214
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:03,900
Yes, of course!

215
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,750
Isn't it why we established the Mask Group?

216
00:17:05,750 --> 00:17:07,700
To break all the rules,

217
00:17:07,829 --> 00:17:10,030
to challenge all impossibilities, huh?

218
00:17:10,030 --> 00:17:11,720
Even if this Black Fox's threat
looms large,

219
00:17:11,720 --> 00:17:12,680
I'm not afraid.

220
00:17:12,960 --> 00:17:14,890
We will surely emerge victorious.

221
00:17:14,920 --> 00:17:15,720
That's right.

222
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:18,160
The future hasn't arrived yet.

223
00:17:18,750 --> 00:17:20,880
So we still stand a chance to change it.

224
00:17:21,359 --> 00:17:24,230
Everything in the world is ever-changing.

225
00:17:24,550 --> 00:17:26,619
We need to take
the first step towards change

226
00:17:26,619 --> 00:17:28,880
and strike with the sword
to cut through the dark.

227
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:31,000
So we can't recklessly
step out of the Boundary.

228
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,730
We must get to know the Black Fox

229
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:34,350
and find a way to defeat it.

230
00:17:34,590 --> 00:17:35,960
Isn't it just a fox demon?

231
00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:37,240
Let's split up to investigate!

232
00:17:37,240 --> 00:17:38,350
We can surely find its weakness.

233
00:17:38,350 --> 00:17:39,110
Exactly.

234
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:40,710
But the point is that

235
00:17:40,790 --> 00:17:43,110
we've looked through
all the information about the Black Fox

236
00:17:43,110 --> 00:17:44,420
in the Yiqi Alliance.

237
00:17:44,570 --> 00:17:45,550
This is all we have.

238
00:17:45,550 --> 00:17:47,440
We'll go investigate
the Black Fox's birthplace,

239
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:48,520
the Beast Kingdom.

240
00:17:49,070 --> 00:17:50,460
The Beast Kingdom?

241
00:17:51,070 --> 00:17:53,260
Jiuhuo was sealed in the Beast Kingdom.

242
00:17:53,260 --> 00:17:56,260
Jia Lan also transformed
into the Black Fox in the Beast Kingdom.

243
00:17:56,260 --> 00:17:58,920
Why did the Beast Kingdom
have the nerve to do this 500 years ago?

244
00:17:58,920 --> 00:18:01,580
What on earth happened in that dungeon?

245
00:18:01,670 --> 00:18:02,830
We'll delve into them all.

246
00:18:02,830 --> 00:18:04,370
I'll dispatch someone
to the Beast Kingdom now.

247
00:18:04,370 --> 00:18:05,850
No, I'll go in person.

248
00:18:07,050 --> 00:18:08,310
Quzhuo, you go with me.

249
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,550
The rest of you stay in the Yiqi Alliance,

250
00:18:10,550 --> 00:18:12,280
ready to support us at any time.

251
00:18:13,540 --> 00:18:14,680
Give me three days.

252
00:18:15,020 --> 00:18:15,830
I'll get things ready

253
00:18:15,830 --> 00:18:17,500
for your travel in the Beast Kingdom.

254
00:18:17,500 --> 00:18:18,110
Okay.

255
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:23,580
He takes me only!

256
00:18:25,510 --> 00:18:26,750
Great!

257
00:18:29,960 --> 00:18:30,920
Hongye's got a sharp eye.

258
00:18:30,920 --> 00:18:31,510
Hongye.

259
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,460
The hairpin you asked for.

260
00:18:39,370 --> 00:18:41,700
This is the first time my Ruyi Pavilion has

261
00:18:41,790 --> 00:18:43,920
made the same design twice.

262
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:47,170
Good thing Young Master Wangquan

263
00:18:47,170 --> 00:18:48,380
is rich and generous.

264
00:18:48,750 --> 00:18:49,430
Thanks.

265
00:19:06,490 --> 00:19:07,950
This scented tea is great.

266
00:19:08,460 --> 00:19:11,160
Of course, this is my careful pick.

267
00:19:15,030 --> 00:19:16,000
Miss Dongfang,

268
00:19:17,530 --> 00:19:19,350
we've got some clues about the matter

269
00:19:19,350 --> 00:19:21,010
you entrusted me to look into.

270
00:19:28,410 --> 00:19:31,670
Before marrying your father,
your mother, Jiang Juanxue,

271
00:19:32,050 --> 00:19:34,580
used to be the Northern Hill Sect's Saintess.

272
00:19:35,350 --> 00:19:36,680
The Northern Hill Sect?

273
00:19:39,110 --> 00:19:40,390
There's someone

274
00:19:41,060 --> 00:19:43,350
who should know more about this than I do.

275
00:19:49,800 --> 00:19:50,480
My father.

276
00:19:51,480 --> 00:19:54,740
Back then, to marry Jiang Juanxue,
Master Dongfang gave up

277
00:19:55,040 --> 00:19:57,000
his promising career and stepped away

278
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,600
from the martial arts world.

279
00:19:59,690 --> 00:20:03,130
[Pharmaceutical Yard]

280
00:20:13,030 --> 00:20:13,680
Father.

281
00:20:14,990 --> 00:20:15,730
Huaizhu.

282
00:20:16,300 --> 00:20:16,950
Come on,

283
00:20:17,720 --> 00:20:18,720
sit by my side.

284
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:23,410
It's midsummer.

285
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:28,550
There are plenty of stars every night.

286
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:32,750
In the past,

287
00:20:33,590 --> 00:20:35,190
your mother liked to sit here

288
00:20:35,350 --> 00:20:38,680
and gaze at the stars
whenever something was bothering her.

289
00:20:39,350 --> 00:20:41,110
She preferred to keep

290
00:20:41,750 --> 00:20:43,350
all the pressure to herself.

291
00:20:44,550 --> 00:20:45,790
My dear Huaizhu,

292
00:20:48,350 --> 00:20:49,810
you're actually the same.

293
00:20:54,070 --> 00:20:54,790
Father.

294
00:20:56,790 --> 00:21:00,590
You seem to have had something
on your mind since your return.

295
00:21:01,830 --> 00:21:05,920
And it's related to your mother.

296
00:21:11,550 --> 00:21:13,310
Do you have anything to ask me?

297
00:21:18,030 --> 00:21:18,640
Father.

298
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:22,260
Do you know Mother's background?

299
00:21:22,680 --> 00:21:27,720
She came from the Northern Hill Sect
of the Beast Kingdom.

300
00:21:30,790 --> 00:21:32,270
Then why did she come here?

301
00:21:33,940 --> 00:21:35,440
To meet me.

302
00:21:36,990 --> 00:21:38,350
Your mother once said

303
00:21:38,690 --> 00:21:41,640
she used up all the luck in her life

304
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,440
just to meet me.

305
00:21:49,160 --> 00:21:52,760
I remember,
shortly after giving birth to Qinlan,

306
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:54,730
she was hanging by a thread.

307
00:21:57,480 --> 00:22:00,290
It was summer too.

308
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:03,520
The stars were just as numerous.

309
00:22:05,310 --> 00:22:07,920
I still remember she told me

310
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:10,240
to forgive her

311
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:14,230
for not telling me all her secrets,

312
00:22:15,720 --> 00:22:19,400
for bearing and doing so much on her own.

313
00:22:21,830 --> 00:22:23,310
Why didn't she tell you

314
00:22:24,610 --> 00:22:26,470
and face it together with you?

315
00:22:28,500 --> 00:22:29,470
She said

316
00:22:30,550 --> 00:22:33,720
the story behind her was very dark.

317
00:22:34,860 --> 00:22:36,600
She wanted to keep

318
00:22:36,830 --> 00:22:40,450
that Dongfang Churi she knew,
who could light up everyone's world,

319
00:22:40,450 --> 00:22:41,530
for you all.

320
00:22:45,020 --> 00:22:47,780
I can give you your mother's letter now.

321
00:22:50,950 --> 00:22:51,750
Letter?

322
00:22:54,510 --> 00:22:58,110
Your mother wrote you this letter.

323
00:23:01,550 --> 00:23:02,510
She said

324
00:23:03,750 --> 00:23:05,350
she felt guilty towards you.

325
00:23:05,890 --> 00:23:09,440
If one day you want an answer,

326
00:23:11,560 --> 00:23:12,920
you could open this letter.

327
00:23:12,870 --> 00:23:21,230
[To Huaizhu]

328
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:28,270
Father, you've

329
00:23:29,300 --> 00:23:31,100
never opened it all these years?

330
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,130
This letter is from your mother to you.

331
00:23:34,560 --> 00:23:35,950
Why would I read it?

332
00:23:48,800 --> 00:23:49,690
Huaizhu,

333
00:23:50,330 --> 00:23:52,780
I have lived a life of twists and turns.

334
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:55,450
Only after I met your father

335
00:23:55,680 --> 00:23:57,880
did I start to live like a normal person.

336
00:23:58,310 --> 00:23:59,920
But as a mother,

337
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:02,810
I have always felt guilty towards you.

338
00:24:03,750 --> 00:24:06,320
If you have the courage
to change your fate,

339
00:24:06,770 --> 00:24:09,000
go to the Drunken Dream Tower
in the Beast Kingdom,

340
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:11,090
find a person named Er Zhuyu,

341
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:13,600
and manage to get
the Twilight Mist Flower.

342
00:24:14,310 --> 00:24:18,250
Then you will get
all the answers you're looking for.

343
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:24,810
From Jiang Juanxue,
Northern Hill Sect's Saintess.

344
00:24:25,570 --> 00:24:28,870
This is your mother's true identity.

345
00:24:34,090 --> 00:24:37,440
[From Jiang Juanxue,
Northern Hill Sect's Saintess.]

346
00:24:36,360 --> 00:24:37,060
Father,

347
00:24:38,340 --> 00:24:40,070
I need to go to the Beast Kingdom

348
00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:41,830
to investigate the whole story.

349
00:24:41,830 --> 00:24:42,360
Go ahead.

350
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:49,030
Remember,

351
00:24:49,810 --> 00:24:53,270
don't be afraid of the answers
to some questions.

352
00:24:55,110 --> 00:24:56,920
I want more than just an answer.

353
00:24:57,320 --> 00:24:58,780
I also need to work out a way

354
00:24:59,570 --> 00:25:02,900
to change everything
that's going to happen 20 years later.

355
00:25:04,820 --> 00:25:08,060
As expected of my daughter.

356
00:25:16,040 --> 00:25:17,450
The Drunken Dream Tower.

357
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:20,470
The Twilight Mist Flower.

358
00:25:24,790 --> 00:25:25,720
Junior Huaizhu,

359
00:25:26,830 --> 00:25:29,400
you sure have a lot of secrets.

360
00:26:13,570 --> 00:26:16,220
You're drinking without saying a word.

361
00:26:23,850 --> 00:26:26,160
Then, as usual, I'll take a guess first.

362
00:26:29,500 --> 00:26:30,470
A man.

363
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:40,130
From the Mask Group.

364
00:26:51,880 --> 00:26:52,810
With three eyes.

365
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:02,240
You already knew the answer,

366
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:04,000
yet you still made me drink three cups!

367
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:04,720
With your tolerance,

368
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:06,850
even 30 cups are a piece of cake for you.

369
00:27:07,680 --> 00:27:10,640
So? Did he hurt your feelings?

370
00:27:12,980 --> 00:27:13,790
No.

371
00:27:15,330 --> 00:27:16,750
I just feel like

372
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:19,210
there's a rock pressing

373
00:27:19,350 --> 00:27:21,110
on my heart, weighing me down

374
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:22,310
all day long.

375
00:27:23,790 --> 00:27:25,320
Have you ever felt the same?

376
00:27:26,110 --> 00:27:26,710
Of course.

377
00:27:27,110 --> 00:27:28,910
Because of your crush, Huaizhu?

378
00:27:33,830 --> 00:27:34,510
However,

379
00:27:35,810 --> 00:27:37,250
when I hear her voice,

380
00:27:37,870 --> 00:27:38,890
see her smiles,

381
00:27:39,290 --> 00:27:40,600
and stay with her,

382
00:27:40,920 --> 00:27:42,120
the rock disappears.

383
00:27:43,280 --> 00:27:45,250
Yet once we're apart,

384
00:27:45,590 --> 00:27:48,680
the rock is back again.

385
00:27:48,810 --> 00:27:51,370
Right? I feel the same way.

386
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:53,780
Worried about losing him though,

387
00:27:54,110 --> 00:27:58,240
I still look forward to seeing him every day.

388
00:27:58,480 --> 00:27:59,240
Zui,

389
00:28:00,860 --> 00:28:03,690
then you should learn from me.

390
00:28:05,590 --> 00:28:06,620
Learn what?

391
00:28:06,970 --> 00:28:08,050
To seek answers,

392
00:28:08,600 --> 00:28:09,730
not to wait for them.

393
00:28:10,830 --> 00:28:11,590
But how?

394
00:28:12,490 --> 00:28:15,280
Let's think of a way together.

395
00:28:37,060 --> 00:28:37,860
Hongye.

396
00:28:37,800 --> 00:28:41,650
[Unparalleled Sword]

397

The Beast Kingdom is treacherous.

398
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:43,400
Are you sure you'll only
let Quzhuo go with you?

399
00:28:44,570 --> 00:28:45,900
Making a fuss can easily

400
00:28:46,350 --> 00:28:47,750
leak things out and cause

401
00:28:47,750 --> 00:28:49,010
unnecessary trouble.

402
00:28:49,920 --> 00:28:51,030
While I'm away,

403
00:28:51,490 --> 00:28:53,290
you're in charge of all affairs.

404
00:28:54,300 --> 00:28:55,100
Also,

405
00:28:58,350 --> 00:28:59,750
spend more time with Zui,

406
00:28:59,890 --> 00:29:02,720
trying to figure out her thoughts.

407
00:29:04,920 --> 00:29:05,270
Hongye...

408
00:29:05,270 --> 00:29:05,830
Yitan,

409
00:29:07,240 --> 00:29:08,920
you see the big picture and think a lot,

410
00:29:08,920 --> 00:29:11,380
hoping to do things perfectly.
That's good.

411
00:29:12,260 --> 00:29:14,920
But when it comes
to a relationship, hesitation

412
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:16,060
means cowardice.

[Talismans of the Great Grotto]

414
00:29:45,810 --> 00:29:48,180
Hongye and Yitan should
be done talking by now, right?

415
00:29:48,180 --> 00:29:49,390
So next,

416
00:29:50,500 --> 00:29:52,430
let's get down to business as well.

417
00:29:54,710 --> 00:29:57,240
What "business"
could you two possibly have?

418
00:29:57,690 --> 00:29:59,040
This is a truth-telling talisman.

419
00:29:59,040 --> 00:30:00,830
Being enchanted by it,
one must speak the truth.

420
00:30:00,830 --> 00:30:01,850
The side effect is

421
00:30:01,900 --> 00:30:03,200
vomiting the next day.

422
00:30:03,740 --> 00:30:05,270
The wine is the Green Bamboo Leaf.

423
00:30:05,270 --> 00:30:07,290
It can force one
to speak the truth as well.

424
00:30:07,290 --> 00:30:09,440
The side effect is also
vomiting the next day.

425
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:10,900
-Choose one.
-Choose one.

426

Yang Yitan must have feelings for you.

428
00:30:13,710 --> 00:30:15,320
Even a blind man could tell.

429
00:30:19,870 --> 00:30:21,570
I think it makes sense.

430
00:30:21,720 --> 00:30:23,070
Now, some worries just stop Yitan

431
00:30:23,070 --> 00:30:24,070
from confessing.

432
00:30:24,070 --> 00:30:25,670
We need to force it out of him.

433
00:30:25,680 --> 00:30:26,880
There are plenty of ways!

-Choose one.

435
00:30:28,550 --> 00:30:30,260
I will choose,

436
00:30:30,350 --> 00:30:31,030
but...

437
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:35,240
Is there one
without the vomiting side effect?

438
00:30:35,310 --> 00:30:37,780
Yitan was deeply wounded in Sky City.

439
00:30:37,810 --> 00:30:39,310
It's a matter of lifelong importance.

440
00:30:39,310 --> 00:30:40,830
A little vomiting is totally fine!

441
00:30:40,830 --> 00:30:42,560

Why not use both?

Come on.

00:30:50,840 --> 00:30:52,900
You can really hold your liquor.

445
00:31:16,030 --> 00:31:18,420
Yitan, you may not know.

446

countless times today.

449
00:31:26,400 --> 00:31:27,960
Whenever I imagine myself

450
00:31:28,040 --> 00:31:31,450
being all alone 20 years later,

451
00:31:33,490 --> 00:31:34,530
I just...

452
00:31:35,880 --> 00:31:36,640
I just

453
00:31:38,620 --> 00:31:40,970
want you to have another drink, Yitan.

454
00:31:41,070 --> 00:31:42,790
No more wine. Or I'll get drunk.

455
00:31:42,790 --> 00:31:44,830
Have one more, Yitan, just one more.

456
00:31:44,830 --> 00:31:45,960
Yeah, just drink it.

457
00:31:46,400 --> 00:31:47,710
I'm suffering inside!

458

Come on, bottoms up.

459

462
00:32:16,200 --> 00:32:16,940
What did he say?

463
00:32:16,940 --> 00:32:18,920
He said the moon is so full tonight.

464
00:32:19,030 --> 00:32:19,660
Really?

465
00:32:19,750 --> 00:32:20,200
Yes.

00:32:22,790 --> 00:32:23,450
Yang Yitan.

467
00:32:25,070 --> 00:32:26,400
Answer me right now.

468
00:32:26,400 --> 00:32:28,100
Do you like Zui or not?

469
00:32:28,430 --> 00:32:30,350
You're such a heavyweight!

470
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:32,850
Are you going to knock me out with wine?

471
00:32:35,140 --> 00:32:36,880
Whether I like Zui or not

472
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:39,350
has nothing to do with you, blotto man!

473
00:32:41,510 --> 00:32:42,590
But now you look

474
00:32:43,400 --> 00:32:45,260
quite similar to Zui when I first

475
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:46,750
met her.

476
00:32:47,830 --> 00:32:49,590
The first time you met Zui?

477
00:32:52,160 --> 00:32:53,000
I see.

478
00:32:53,920 --> 00:32:55,000
Back then,

479
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:57,400
Zui must be very young, right?

480
00:33:00,160 --> 00:33:01,270
That day,

481
00:33:02,060 --> 00:33:04,070
it happened to be her family's banquet.

482
00:33:04,070 --> 00:33:04,870
She was seven,

483
00:33:06,510 --> 00:33:08,710
but she sneakily drank their rice wine.

484
00:33:09,350 --> 00:33:10,930
Then she heard that

485
00:33:11,070 --> 00:33:14,160
I was her betrothed husband.

486
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:16,110
She totally lost it

487
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:18,070
and ran after me,

488
00:33:18,070 --> 00:33:20,070
cursing and biting.

489
00:33:22,830 --> 00:33:24,070
And then,

490
00:33:25,240 --> 00:33:26,500
she got tired of biting

491
00:33:27,160 --> 00:33:28,720
but still didn't let go.

492
00:33:29,960 --> 00:33:31,360
She pressed down on my leg

493
00:33:32,070 --> 00:33:33,600
and even talked in her sleep

494
00:33:34,160 --> 00:33:35,090
the whole night.

495
00:33:35,720 --> 00:33:37,580
So you must have hated her, right?

496
00:33:55,440 --> 00:33:57,210
Well, I mean...

497
00:33:59,400 --> 00:34:00,600
Logically speaking,

498
00:34:02,400 --> 00:34:03,930
I should have disliked her.

499
00:34:06,030 --> 00:34:07,690
But somehow I just watched her

500
00:34:09,409 --> 00:34:10,760
all night in that state,

501
00:34:12,150 --> 00:34:15,460
finding her delicately pretty

502
00:34:15,980 --> 00:34:17,120
and adorable.

00:34:19,030 --> 00:34:21,429
My legs didn't even
feel that numb anymore.

504
00:34:32,360 --> 00:34:33,030
So,

505
00:34:33,719 --> 00:34:35,850
you started to be into her at that time?

506
00:34:36,400 --> 00:34:37,070
Right?

507
00:34:46,590 --> 00:34:47,230
Yes.

Yitan,

559
00:36:08,550 --> 00:36:10,280
you see the big picture and think a lot,

560
00:36:10,280 --> 00:36:11,560

Hongye.

571
00:36:38,230 --> 00:36:39,290
What's the matter?

572
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:44,080
There's something
I'd like to negotiate with you.

573
00:36:45,190 --> 00:36:46,250
Then come in first.

574
00:36:47,190 --> 00:36:47,840
Hongye.

575
00:36:49,360 --> 00:36:50,620
I'd rather say it here.

576
00:36:57,310 --> 00:36:58,650
I want to propose to Zui.

577
00:37:01,670 --> 00:37:03,070
I hope you can agree to it.

578
00:37:04,280 --> 00:37:05,620
I've thought it through.

579
00:37:05,620 --> 00:37:06,650
Life is short,

580
00:37:07,040 --> 00:37:09,170
and we don't know
what will happen in the future.

581
00:37:09,170 --> 00:37:10,940
Zui has always been so nice to me,

582
00:37:10,940 --> 00:37:12,540
and I genuinely like her too.

583
00:37:13,760 --> 00:37:15,780
And I don't want to hurt

584
00:37:17,190 --> 00:37:18,450
her feelings anymore.

585
00:37:22,110 --> 00:37:23,230
Does Zui know about it?

586
00:37:23,230 --> 00:37:24,230
Not yet.

587
00:37:27,800 --> 00:37:30,330
You two have been betrothed
since childhood.

588
00:37:30,840 --> 00:37:31,640
I'm certainly

589
00:37:32,750 --> 00:37:33,880
rooting for you two.

590
00:37:35,110 --> 00:37:36,170
Thank you, Hongye.

591
00:37:36,360 --> 00:37:38,090
Then I'll go prepare for it now.

592
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:40,060
Young Master Yang.

593
00:37:42,360 --> 00:37:43,160
Young Master,

594
00:37:44,590 --> 00:37:46,520
the young lady wants to talk to you.

595
00:37:48,630 --> 00:37:50,590
What's up? You need my help?

596
00:37:51,190 --> 00:37:51,800
Yes.

597
00:37:52,510 --> 00:37:53,360
I

598
00:37:53,360 --> 00:37:54,760
want to propose to Yitan.

599
00:37:55,550 --> 00:37:56,670
Whether you agree or not,

600
00:37:56,670 --> 00:37:57,670
I'm going to do it.

601
00:37:58,590 --> 00:37:59,820
Life is short.

602
00:37:59,960 --> 00:38:01,680
Only recently did I realize

603
00:38:01,800 --> 00:38:03,800
Yitan's care for me after so many years.

604
00:38:03,800 --> 00:38:06,530
I don't want to hurt his feelings anymore.

605
00:38:09,290 --> 00:38:10,760
So you've already made up your mind.

606
00:38:10,760 --> 00:38:12,360
Well, I still have to tell you.

607
00:38:12,360 --> 00:38:13,550
The eldest brother is like a father!

608
00:38:13,550 --> 00:38:15,150
So you just informed me of it?

609
00:38:15,580 --> 00:38:16,680
I've made a plan.

610
00:38:16,920 --> 00:38:19,360
I'll confess my love
near the Ruyi Pavilion.
