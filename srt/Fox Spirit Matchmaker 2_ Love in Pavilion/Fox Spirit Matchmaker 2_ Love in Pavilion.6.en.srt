00:01:40,630 --> 00:01:45,820
[Love in Pavilion]

2
00:01:46,420 --> 00:01:50,870
[Episode 6]

3
00:02:06,710 --> 00:02:09,970
All the crucial intelligence of the Yiqi Alliance is here.

4
00:02:11,630 --> 00:02:14,860
[A group of demons has gathered in the west of Water Ravine, many of whom are fierce tiger demons.]

5
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:14,150
Just as you thought,

6
00:02:14,150 --> 00:02:16,700
although Master Nangong died, the Nangong family's influence remains.

7
00:02:16,700 --> 00:02:18,000
Nangong Chui is already on his way

8
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,460
to the Inspection Bureau.

9
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:22,250
He retrieved all of Mu Xiaowu's files.

10
00:02:22,910 --> 00:02:23,800
Let him do it.

11
00:02:24,300 --> 00:02:26,430
I hope he can be as stupid as possible,

12
00:02:26,450 --> 00:02:29,850
helping me remove the thorn in the Inspection Bureau's side.

13
00:02:30,860 --> 00:02:32,110
I knew it.

14
00:02:32,340 --> 00:02:33,150
You wouldn't just

15
00:02:33,150 --> 00:02:35,410
come here for the Yang family's wedding.

16
00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:37,440
This is also the reason why she hates me.

17
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:38,250
She?

18
00:02:40,740 --> 00:02:44,590
Is the lady downstairs today Miss Dongfang?

19
00:02:48,530 --> 00:02:52,000
So this show is for her to see?

20
00:02:56,860 --> 00:02:58,840
It doesn't matter if the show fails.

21
00:02:58,840 --> 00:02:59,870
After all,

22
00:02:59,990 --> 00:03:01,850
Miss Wangquan will foot the bill.

23
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:12,000
That's all. Thank you.

24
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:14,000
Then I'll go wrap up the jewelry.

25
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,530
Miss, please wait a moment.

26
00:03:28,530 --> 00:03:30,250
It's so beautiful.

27
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:33,050
It's really pretty.

28
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:41,870
Do you like it?

29
00:03:42,890 --> 00:03:43,940
I like it.

30
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:45,570
Then I'll buy it for you.

31
00:03:45,910 --> 00:03:47,079
Thank you, Huaizhu.

32
00:03:47,190 --> 00:03:48,450
Let me put it on for you.

33
00:03:52,510 --> 00:03:53,980
It looks really nice.

34
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:56,150
I like her.

35
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:58,980
I must make her my sister-in-law.

36
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:09,750
Go ahead and use whatever tricks you have left.

37
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:11,000
Don't drag it on endlessly.

38
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:11,560
Qinlan.

39
00:04:24,190 --> 00:04:25,710
Besides Ruyi Pavilion,

40
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:28,800
the largest pavilion in the city is Yunjing Pavilion.

41
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:31,240
The owner will stop you two then.

42
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:34,790
He'll say, since it's the Lotus Viewing Festival today,

43
00:04:34,790 --> 00:04:37,250
there are two spots for drinking at the top.

44
00:04:37,659 --> 00:04:39,560
Upon seeing your gorgeous appearances,

45
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:40,750
you're such a match made in heaven.

46
00:04:40,750 --> 00:04:42,950
He'll be willing to offer them for free.

47
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:44,920
That fat Chen from Yunjing Pavilion

48
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:46,159
is not a good person.

49
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:49,090
He took several hundred taels as a bribe for this.

50
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:51,590
The money certainly won't be refunded.

51
00:04:55,159 --> 00:04:56,120
Well,

52
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:58,659
someone did a bad thing with good intentions.

53
00:04:58,659 --> 00:05:00,970
But if there has been bad blood between you two,

54
00:05:00,970 --> 00:05:02,790
you can still

55
00:05:02,810 --> 00:05:04,740
go up together for a pleasant chat.

56
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:11,690
Qinlan,

57
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:14,800
can you take the jewelry back to Yan?

58
00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:18,900
She agreed?

59
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:24,920
Miss Qingmu Yuan actually made it.

60
00:05:43,270 --> 00:05:45,670
I've caused much disturbance to you today.

61
00:05:47,630 --> 00:05:49,490
Please forgive me, Miss Huaizhu.

62
00:05:55,159 --> 00:05:58,510
I should be the one to toast you first with this cup of wine.

63
00:05:58,920 --> 00:06:01,160
Thank you for your help, Young Master Wangquan.

64
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:03,560
What you did has helped Yan find happiness.

65
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:22,140
Let me toast you

66
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:25,070
with this second cup of wine, to thank you again.

67
00:06:25,070 --> 00:06:27,200
What's the reason for this second cup?

68
00:06:28,510 --> 00:06:31,040
It's hard to get a table here for stargazing.

69
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:34,920
I suppose Miss Qingmu and your sister

70
00:06:35,159 --> 00:06:36,690
must have spent quite a bit.

71
00:06:37,340 --> 00:06:40,100
Of course, it's all thanks to your favor.

72
00:06:51,510 --> 00:06:52,310
Miss Huaizhu,

73
00:06:53,310 --> 00:06:54,370
since you're here,

74
00:06:54,750 --> 00:06:57,040
we shouldn't let these countless stars go to waste.

75
00:06:57,040 --> 00:06:58,640
If you truly want to thank me,

76
00:06:59,070 --> 00:07:00,130
for this third cup,

77
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:02,370
let's drink slowly.

78
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:26,970
Miss Huaizhu, why do you like stargazing?

79
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:33,680
Because under the stars are the stories of me and my family.

80
00:07:35,430 --> 00:07:36,760
Stories of your family?

81
00:07:38,950 --> 00:07:40,240
Sweet Yin Cakes,

82
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:41,960
endless conversations,

83
00:07:42,490 --> 00:07:44,630
and the moment when we pointed at the starry sky

84
00:07:44,630 --> 00:07:46,240
to claim our own stars.

85
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:52,560
So where is

86
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:54,040
your star?

87
00:07:57,190 --> 00:07:58,830
It's still far away in the sky,

88
00:07:58,830 --> 00:07:59,950
but I'm certain

89
00:08:00,750 --> 00:08:02,550
that the star is definitely him.

You tricked me!

123
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:42,550
You're the one who plotted against me first.

124
00:09:42,550 --> 00:09:43,870
I was wrong! I was wrong!

125
00:09:43,870 --> 00:09:44,840
I was wrong!

126
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:46,790
I was wrong.

127
00:09:46,790 --> 00:09:47,850
Alright, alright.

128
00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:49,600
Let's go find Yan later.

129
00:09:50,790 --> 00:09:52,370
But, Huaizhu,

130
00:09:52,840 --> 00:09:56,750
yesterday, after you went to the Star-Gazing Platform with that Wangquan,

131
00:09:56,750 --> 00:09:58,360
did anything happen?

132
00:09:59,080 --> 00:10:00,680
What could possibly happen?

133
00:10:13,270 --> 00:10:15,870
He even knows that you love Yin Cakes the most?

134
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:17,600
What exactly do you see

135
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:19,510
in that deceitful young master?

136
00:10:20,030 --> 00:10:22,120
It's like seeking fruit from a barren tree.

137
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:23,360
Why waste time?

138
00:10:25,550 --> 00:10:27,440
Young Master Wangquan

139
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:28,600
is not deceitful.

140
00:10:32,270 --> 00:10:33,030
Huaizhu.

141
00:10:33,910 --> 00:10:34,670
Hongye.

142
00:10:35,270 --> 00:10:37,630
Last night, there was a bright moon and sparse stars.

143
00:10:37,630 --> 00:10:40,240
Was there any progress

144
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:42,370
between you two beneath the Milky Way?

145
00:10:43,010 --> 00:10:46,170
What kind of progress do you think we could make?

146
00:10:49,270 --> 00:10:50,330
What are you doing?

147
00:10:52,270 --> 00:10:53,910
There's no scent of rouge,

148
00:10:53,910 --> 00:10:57,170
which proves you two haven't had any intimate contact yet.

149
00:10:57,270 --> 00:10:58,030
Hongye,

150
00:10:58,270 --> 00:11:00,630
you haven't told Miss Huaizhu yet?

151
00:11:02,270 --> 00:11:03,780
Stop asking me all the time, you two.

152
00:11:03,780 --> 00:11:05,440
I'd like to ask you both

153
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:08,800
if there's anything you want to tell me.

154
00:11:12,870 --> 00:11:13,750
Hongye,

155
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:14,720
well...

156
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:16,230
Alright, alright, alright.

157
00:11:16,230 --> 00:11:18,760
You don't have to take responsibility today.

158
00:11:19,030 --> 00:11:20,630
It was my idea.

159
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,550
I took the wrong thing. I got the Wind and Rain Talisman instead.

160
00:11:23,550 --> 00:11:25,150
At most, I'll just get scolded a bit.

161
00:11:25,150 --> 00:11:26,510
They'll punish me by not allowing me to go on missions.

162
00:11:26,510 --> 00:11:27,770
I'm not afraid anyway.

163
00:11:27,870 --> 00:11:28,890
Everyone's on my side.

164
00:11:28,890 --> 00:11:30,200
I can go secretly.

165
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:31,200
Indeed.

166
00:11:31,650 --> 00:11:33,450
It's not the first time, anyway.

167
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:38,790
Thank you.

168
00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:44,470
So there were sparks,

169
00:11:44,630 --> 00:11:45,360
right?

170
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:49,670
Yes, thanks to your careful arrangements,

171
00:11:50,270 --> 00:11:51,150
these sparks

172
00:11:51,320 --> 00:11:52,360
were quite big.

173
00:11:52,450 --> 00:11:54,660
See? I told you it would work.

174
00:11:55,460 --> 00:11:56,660
The sparks were so big

175
00:11:57,590 --> 00:11:59,050
that they burned to ashes.

176
00:12:11,720 --> 00:12:13,150
It's okay, it's okay, it's okay.

177
00:12:13,150 --> 00:12:15,720
If you want to win a fair lady's heart, you need to make an effort.

178
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:18,580
We both like this potential sister-in-law anyway.

179
00:12:18,790 --> 00:12:20,050
Don't be discouraged.

180
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:21,720
Enough.

181
00:12:22,510 --> 00:12:23,750
Today is the grand wedding.

182
00:12:23,750 --> 00:12:25,630
Some of the noble families might cause trouble.

183
00:12:25,630 --> 00:12:26,960
Let's all get prepared.

184
00:12:28,030 --> 00:12:29,230
As for other matters,

185
00:12:31,630 --> 00:12:32,630
let's just let nature take its course.

186
00:12:32,630 --> 00:12:33,150
Okay.

187
00:12:33,790 --> 00:12:35,480
How can we just let it be?

188
00:12:35,550 --> 00:12:36,670
We should strike while the iron is hot.

189
00:12:36,670 --> 00:12:38,080
If the first plan doesn't work, we can try a second one.

190

when they scatter in the rain,

203
00:13:10,150 --> 00:13:11,550
you'll still be at a loss.

204
00:13:12,850 --> 00:13:14,710
When you think it's appropriate,

205
00:13:14,910 --> 00:13:15,750

216
00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:53,530
the groom's bridal sedan chair has arrived at the front gate of the mansion.

217
00:14:53,530 --> 00:14:54,990
He will be here any moment.

218
00:14:57,200 --> 00:15:00,130
Today, just be at ease and be the bride.

219
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:03,000
Nothing else matters besides this.

220
00:15:22,750 --> 00:15:24,800
Today, the son of the Mu family

221
00:15:24,870 --> 00:15:28,240
is going to marry the noble daughter of the Yang family and join the bride's family.

222
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:29,790
May they enjoy the peace.

223
00:15:29,910 --> 00:15:31,640

232
00:16:06,740 --> 00:16:08,920
Why can't he even press down a single sedan chair?

233
00:16:08,920 --> 00:16:11,120

If someone was killed,

369
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:13,980
where's the murderer?

370
00:22:14,590 --> 00:22:17,320
Bring him here, and I'll interrogate him myself.

371
00:22:20,110 --> 00:22:21,680
The murderer is on the run.

372
00:22:21,750 --> 00:22:23,270
Then how can you say there's an accomplice?

373
00:22:23,270 --> 00:22:25,550
If Mu Xiaowu hadn't released the demon,

374
00:22:25,830 --> 00:22:27,200
the demon wouldn't have caused trouble,

375
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:28,240
and no one would have died.

376
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:29,920
This is a baseless accusation.

377
00:22:29,920 --> 00:22:33,240
I'll consider this an abuse of your authority.

378
00:22:33,960 --> 00:22:35,290
Young Master Wangquan,

379
00:22:35,880 --> 00:22:37,440
would you like me to describe

380
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:39,030
the scene at that time?

381
00:22:43,640 --> 00:22:44,750
Murder!

382
00:22:46,110 --> 00:22:47,030
Murder!

383
00:22:47,070 --> 00:22:48,110
Murder!

384
00:22:50,060 --> 00:22:52,270
[Chu Jing, the carp demon]

385
00:22:53,960 --> 00:22:55,290
Young Master Wangquan,

386
00:22:56,300 --> 00:22:59,150
I know you bailed Mu Xiaowu out of prison,

387
00:23:00,030 --> 00:23:02,430
but with everything that has happened now,

388
00:23:02,510 --> 00:23:04,280
your continued protection

389
00:23:04,680 --> 00:23:06,590
is a bit unreasonable.

390
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:09,000
Since you have the nerve to question me,

391
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:10,530
it shows you came prepared.

392
00:23:10,680 --> 00:23:13,790
Then this matter is an internal affair of the Yiqi Alliance.

393
00:23:13,790 --> 00:23:15,400
All irrelevant personnel can leave.

394
00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:19,720
I will deal with the Inspection Bureau face-to-face.

395
00:23:20,510 --> 00:23:22,640
Let's go, let's go. Hurry, move along.

396
00:23:30,270 --> 00:23:31,070
Yitan.

397
00:23:31,750 --> 00:23:33,480
Take the two newlyweds to rest.

398
00:23:33,790 --> 00:23:34,590
Got it.

399
00:23:49,790 --> 00:23:51,120
Young Master Wangquan,

400
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:53,350
the demon is cunning.

401
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:55,640
I can't find any trace of him for now.

402
00:23:56,070 --> 00:23:58,240
If you insist on seeing him,

403
00:23:58,590 --> 00:24:00,790
isn't that asking too much?

404
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:04,220
The Inspection Bureau arrests people indiscriminately.

405
00:24:04,750 --> 00:24:06,680
Isn't that asking too much as well?

406
00:24:08,070 --> 00:24:10,960
If the Inspection Bureau can't catch the murderer,

407
00:24:11,750 --> 00:24:13,720
should we let Mu Xiaowu

408
00:24:13,720 --> 00:24:16,200
roam free forever?

409
00:24:19,270 --> 00:24:21,670
I will personally go to catch the murderer.

410
00:24:21,880 --> 00:24:23,240
Before I return,

411
00:24:23,790 --> 00:24:25,920
do not touch the Yang family in any way.

412
00:24:28,510 --> 00:24:29,400
Young Master,

413
00:24:31,400 --> 00:24:32,790
how can you prove that?

414
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:35,830
And why should I believe you?

415
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:40,110
If you keep nagging,

416
00:24:40,590 --> 00:24:42,070
I will lose my patience.

417
00:24:44,110 --> 00:24:45,070
Fine.

418
00:24:45,510 --> 00:24:47,270
Then I'll stay here today

419
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:49,880
and wait for your triumphant return.

420
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:02,000
I believe Yan.

421
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:04,510
That carp demon must be innocent.

422
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:06,350
The Inspection Bureau's actions today

423
00:25:06,350 --> 00:25:08,410
are targeting me and the Yang family.

424
00:25:08,440 --> 00:25:10,110
The one framing us behind the scenes

425
00:25:10,110 --> 00:25:11,310
must be Nangong Chui.

426
00:25:13,790 --> 00:25:14,400
Hongye.

427
00:25:15,030 --> 00:25:15,510
Yitan.

428
00:25:15,880 --> 00:25:17,880
I will personally bring back the witness.

429
00:25:17,880 --> 00:25:19,000
Before I return,

430
00:25:19,110 --> 00:25:20,510
you must protect everyone.

431
00:25:20,510 --> 00:25:22,440
Do not hand over Mu Xiaowu under any circumstances.

432
00:25:22,440 --> 00:25:23,170
Understood.

433
00:25:23,350 --> 00:25:25,030
I'm leaving Zui here to keep you company.

434
00:25:25,030 --> 00:25:26,510
If you have any concerns that are hard to express,

435
00:25:26,510 --> 00:25:27,720
just let her cause some trouble.

436
00:25:27,720 --> 00:25:28,440
Got it.

437
00:25:28,680 --> 00:25:29,750
I'll go with you.

438
00:25:32,150 --> 00:25:33,270
You're the smartest.

439
00:25:33,270 --> 00:25:34,440
Stay with the Yang family.

440
00:25:34,440 --> 00:25:35,790
If there's any sign of trouble,

441
00:25:35,790 --> 00:25:37,880
send a message through Huadian, the forehead makeup.

442
00:25:37,880 --> 00:25:39,070
His visit this time

443
00:25:39,240 --> 00:25:40,680
won't end peacefully.

444
00:25:40,920 --> 00:25:41,750
So what?

445
00:25:44,110 --> 00:25:44,910
Let's go then.

446
00:25:59,350 --> 00:26:00,550
Master Nangong,

447
00:26:02,070 --> 00:26:04,070
how's your leg injury?

448
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:07,200
It seems to be getting worse, doesn't it?

449
00:26:16,830 --> 00:26:19,230
Thank you for your concern, Miss Wangquan.

450
00:26:20,160 --> 00:26:22,200
I can still manage to walk a bit.

451
00:26:23,160 --> 00:26:23,960
Is that so?

452
00:26:24,750 --> 00:26:27,750
Could it be that the Nangong family has done so many bad things

453
00:26:27,750 --> 00:26:30,750
that karma is coming back to bite you?

454
00:26:33,110 --> 00:26:35,270
Master Nangong, please have a seat.

455
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:44,880
Wangquan Hongye has maintained a low profile over the past years.

456
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:46,280
As soon as my father died,

457
00:26:46,790 --> 00:26:49,120
you don't even bother to pretend anymore.

458
00:26:49,590 --> 00:26:51,120
However, the Yiqi Alliance

459
00:26:51,590 --> 00:26:54,450
isn't under the control of your family alone, is it?

460
00:26:54,510 --> 00:26:56,030
Well, I'd like to know

461
00:26:56,030 --> 00:26:57,510
which family is so unwise.

462
00:26:59,110 --> 00:27:01,270
Stop trying to get information out of me.

463
00:27:01,270 --> 00:27:02,600
You've gotten smarter.

464
00:27:03,160 --> 00:27:04,590
But with your leg injury,

465
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:05,750
you're not planning to

466
00:27:05,750 --> 00:27:07,310
wait here until Hongye returns, are you?

467
00:27:07,310 --> 00:27:09,830
Indeed, Master Nangong,

468
00:27:10,110 --> 00:27:12,640
you should return to the Inspection Bureau first.

469
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:13,510
As you can see,

470
00:27:13,510 --> 00:27:15,200
today is a joyous occasion.

471
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:17,790
We can't lose too much face.

472
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:21,680
Master Yang,

473
00:27:22,440 --> 00:27:26,680
if you're afraid of losing face, don't marry your daughter to such a useless man.

474
00:27:26,680 --> 00:27:30,070
My suggestion is that Mu Renzhi be directly handed over to us

475
00:27:30,070 --> 00:27:31,920
and taken back to the Inspection Bureau.

476
00:27:31,920 --> 00:27:34,000
When Wangquan Hongye returns,

477
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:36,510
we can deal with them all together.

478
00:27:37,160 --> 00:27:39,590
Didn't Young Master Wangquan just say...

479
00:27:39,720 --> 00:27:41,680
The Yiqi Alliance stands united,

480
00:27:41,880 --> 00:27:44,810
and we will never wrongly accuse an innocent person.

481
00:27:45,880 --> 00:27:50,510
Master Yang, you wouldn't rely on your good relations with the Wangquan family

482
00:27:50,790 --> 00:27:53,270
to disrespect the Inspection Bureau, would you?

483
00:27:53,270 --> 00:27:55,160
Though the Wangquan family is powerful,

484
00:27:55,160 --> 00:27:57,240
they can't cover up all the dirty business

485
00:27:57,240 --> 00:27:59,750
of your Yang family, can they?

486
00:28:04,440 --> 00:28:05,350
Well,

487
00:28:06,110 --> 00:28:07,830
if I hand over Renzhi to you,

488
00:28:08,200 --> 00:28:10,310
can you guarantee fair treatment?

489
00:28:13,510 --> 00:28:14,790
Of course.

490
00:28:18,200 --> 00:28:19,030
Guards!

491
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:20,240
Wait!

492
00:28:22,990 --> 00:28:25,140
Many things have happened in the Yang family today.

493
00:28:25,140 --> 00:28:26,840
My grandfather is exhausted, both physically and mentally.

494
00:28:26,840 --> 00:28:28,370
He needs to rest privately.

495
00:28:28,510 --> 00:28:29,910
Please see our guest out.

496
00:28:30,030 --> 00:28:31,510
Yitan, Yitan.

497
00:28:31,510 --> 00:28:32,430
Yang Huanzhou,

498
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:35,600
who's really in charge in your Yang family?

499
00:28:36,200 --> 00:28:36,830
Guards!

500
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:37,680
Yes!

501
00:28:38,270 --> 00:28:39,270
See the guest out!

502
00:28:40,920 --> 00:28:43,720
Young Master Yang, think it over carefully.

503
00:28:45,790 --> 00:28:46,590
Yang Li.

504
00:28:46,750 --> 00:28:47,510
Yes.

505
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:50,880
See Master Nangong out.

506
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:52,360
Master Nangong, please.

507
00:29:10,300 --> 00:29:11,450
Yang Yitan,

508
00:29:11,960 --> 00:29:13,030
do you know

509
00:29:13,030 --> 00:29:14,750
who you're talking to?

510
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:20,070
Master Nangong,

511
00:29:21,830 --> 00:29:23,290
don't make me take action.

512
00:29:52,270 --> 00:29:54,000
-Young Master.
-Young Master.

513
00:29:55,240 --> 00:29:56,670
Help me up.

514
00:30:01,960 --> 00:30:03,700
Listen to me carefully,

515
00:30:04,680 --> 00:30:07,790
if I step out of this doorway today,

516
00:30:08,160 --> 00:30:11,620
your Clairvoyant Yang family will never have another chance!

517
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:14,400
Live or die. It's your choice.

518
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:17,160
I, Wangquan Zui, have always been lawless,

519
00:30:17,310 --> 00:30:19,680
and I'm not as easy to deal with as the Yang family.

520
00:30:19,680 --> 00:30:20,550
Get lost.

521
00:30:22,160 --> 00:30:22,960
Let's go!

522
00:30:32,590 --> 00:30:34,370
This is outrageous!

523
00:30:36,830 --> 00:30:38,070
How dare the Yang family

524
00:30:38,070 --> 00:30:40,530
show such disrespect to our Nangong family?

525
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:43,880
Doesn't the Yang family still have a few placer mines?

526
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:46,070
Send someone to find some excuses

527
00:30:46,680 --> 00:30:49,350
and shut down all those mines today!

528
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:50,200
Got it!

529
00:30:53,720 --> 00:30:54,510
Master.

530
00:30:56,240 --> 00:30:58,550
The Yang family is not a threat, no matter what.

531
00:30:58,550 --> 00:31:00,030
The most important thing right now is

532
00:31:00,030 --> 00:31:01,200
that we absolutely can't let Wangquan Hongye

533
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:02,240
find that demon.

534
00:31:03,350 --> 00:31:04,680
That's easy enough.

535
00:31:06,550 --> 00:31:08,740
He committed murder in public.

536
00:31:09,070 --> 00:31:10,730
The evidence is irrefutable.

537
00:31:10,920 --> 00:31:12,720
Just kill him and be done with it.

538
00:31:13,240 --> 00:31:14,000
Master,

539
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:17,160
that demon stole my demon-controlling talisman

540
00:31:17,160 --> 00:31:18,570
and has disappeared without a trace.

541
00:31:18,570 --> 00:31:20,160
But please rest assured, Master.

542
00:31:20,160 --> 00:31:21,510
We are doing everything in our power.

543
00:31:21,510 --> 00:31:22,720
We'll not let Wangquan Hongye

544
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:25,110
find the whereabouts of that demon before us!

545
00:31:25,110 --> 00:31:25,920
Get lost!

546
00:31:32,200 --> 00:31:33,590
Add two more of these.

547
00:31:33,720 --> 00:31:34,550
How about this one?

548
00:31:34,550 --> 00:31:35,310
Does it look good on me?

549
00:31:35,310 --> 00:31:36,500
And...

550
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:38,110
Add three more jade pieces.

551
00:31:38,110 --> 00:31:39,440
Young Master Wangquan.

552
00:31:40,680 --> 00:31:42,010
Young Master Wangquan.

553
00:31:44,750 --> 00:31:46,160
