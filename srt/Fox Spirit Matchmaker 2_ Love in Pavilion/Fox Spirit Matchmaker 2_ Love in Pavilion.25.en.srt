91
00:06:55,870 --> 00:06:58,200

92
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:02,070
Come on.

93
00:07:03,270 --> 00:07:05,300
You haven't even seen what the leader of the Mask Group looks like.

94
00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:07,000
How can you be so unwavering?

95
00:07:07,190 --> 00:07:09,340
What if his face is full of pockmarks,

96
00:07:09,510 --> 00:07:11,070
and his nostrils are bigger than his eyes?

97
00:07:11,070 --> 00:07:12,870
Maybe that's why he wears a mask.

98
00:07:14,350 --> 00:07:15,200
Forget it.

99
00:07:15,310 --> 00:07:16,840
It's none of your business.

100
00:07:19,070 --> 00:07:19,930
That's enough.

101
00:07:20,510 --> 00:07:21,910
Is this not to your taste?

102
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:23,360
I'll make something else for you.

103
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:24,240
No need.

104
00:07:29,010 --> 00:07:30,210
It smells quite good.

105
00:07:31,270 --> 00:07:32,600
Can dogs drink alcohol?

106
00:07:33,430 --> 00:07:34,240
Why not?

107
00:07:57,830 --> 00:07:59,159
Hongye, Mrs. Wangquan,

108
00:07:59,159 --> 00:08:00,360
what are you doing?

109
00:08:01,430 --> 00:08:03,120
I owe what Huaizhu and I have today

110
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:04,360
all to you, Quzhuo.

111
00:08:07,310 --> 00:08:08,110
Quzhuo,

112
00:08:10,390 --> 00:08:12,600
this drink is for you.

113
00:08:12,630 --> 00:08:14,270
When Huaizhu and I get married,

114
00:08:14,270 --> 00:08:16,560
you must sit at the main table.

115
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:19,990
Sit at the main table?

116
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:21,560
What an honor.

117
00:08:22,190 --> 00:08:23,250
Thank you, Hongye.

118
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:24,750
Not only that.

119
00:08:24,830 --> 00:08:27,870
When we have children, we'll entrust them to your care.

120
00:08:27,870 --> 00:08:30,930
You're far more reliable than Yang Yitang and Li Zizai.

121
00:08:34,270 --> 00:08:35,470
When the child turns one month old,

122
00:08:35,470 --> 00:08:37,150
I want to sit at the main table too.

123
00:08:37,150 --> 00:08:38,000
No problem.

124
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:41,320
Call me Brother Quzhuo and I'll take you to the main table.

125
00:08:42,030 --> 00:08:43,390
Brother Quzhuo!

126
00:08:44,610 --> 00:08:45,870
Sister Qinlan.

127
00:08:59,510 --> 00:09:01,710
I've been defeated by Wangquan Hongye.

128
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:02,720
Tomorrow,

129
00:09:04,150 --> 00:09:05,680
I will leave Beast Kingdom.

130
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:09,270
Do you even know

131
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:12,000
what you're saying?

132
00:09:14,550 --> 00:09:16,210
I'm afraid you don't know yet,

133
00:09:16,630 --> 00:09:18,390
but the spy you planted in the Yiqi Alliance

134
00:09:18,390 --> 00:09:19,440
has been removed.

135
00:09:20,030 --> 00:09:21,830
The indenture no longer exists.

136
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:24,510
Was it Wangquan Hongye who did it?

137
00:09:25,550 --> 00:09:26,620
So you're saying

138
00:09:26,790 --> 00:09:29,550
you're giving up the chance to become the world's greatest swordsman

139
00:09:29,550 --> 00:09:31,810
and plan to be Wangquan Hongye's lapdog?

140
00:09:32,670 --> 00:09:34,470
What path I'll take in the future

141
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,060
and how I'll walk it

142
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:38,050
is none of your concern.

143
00:09:38,550 --> 00:09:40,550
I have more than just the indenture.

144
00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:45,390
I also know where the remains of Young Master Zhang are.

145
00:09:46,750 --> 00:09:49,630
He was born with six toes on his left foot.

146
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:52,960
As long as I make this secret public,

147
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:56,870
everything you have will cease to exist.

148
00:10:02,550 --> 00:10:03,320
Go ahead.

149
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:06,150
I don't care.

150
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:09,270
What exactly has gotten into you?

151
00:10:09,270 --> 00:10:11,440
What kind of spell did Wangquan Hongye cast on you?

152
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:12,870
He told me a lot of things.

153
00:10:14,510 --> 00:10:16,720
But it was one sentence from Dongfang Huaizhu

154
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:18,000
that truly woke me up.

155
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:19,030
What did she say?

156
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:23,200
Young Master was such a good person.

157
00:10:23,630 --> 00:10:26,830
What he left for you before dying would never be shackles.

158
00:10:32,770 --> 00:10:34,470
A gentleman is like an orchid.

159
00:10:35,790 --> 00:10:38,170
I've helped evil, been coerced by you,

160
00:10:38,270 --> 00:10:39,730
and been wrong for so long.

161
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:43,760
The Young Master gave me the chance to live,

162
00:10:45,270 --> 00:10:47,670
not for me to live in a dark, muddy pit,

163
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:49,240
using any means to become

164
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:51,700
the so-called world's greatest swordsman.

165
00:10:52,750 --> 00:10:54,010
Go ahead and expose it.

166
00:10:54,910 --> 00:10:56,770
If the Zhang family wants me dead,

167
00:10:58,270 --> 00:10:59,470
I'll pay with my life.

168
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:01,440
Only then

169
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:05,930
can I say I didn't fail him.

170
00:11:26,570 --> 00:11:29,900
This is the latest developed demon-controlling talisman.

171
00:11:30,840 --> 00:11:33,370
It doesn't need to be ingested to take effect.

172
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:36,090
You put a sub-talisman on me?

173
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:37,750
To be honest,

174
00:11:37,770 --> 00:11:40,270
I've already fed you demon poison.

175
00:11:40,870 --> 00:11:42,530
Since you're so disobedient,

176
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:46,270
I can only use a demon-controlling talisman to control you,

177
00:11:46,270 --> 00:11:48,910
turning you into the most powerful demon,

178
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,580
to be used by me

179
00:11:50,630 --> 00:11:51,930
and remain my slave for life!

180
00:11:51,930 --> 00:11:54,390
How could there be a mother like you in this world?

181
00:11:54,390 --> 00:11:55,670
You forced me!

182
00:12:53,570 --> 00:12:56,700
How could you not have been affected by the demon poison?

183
00:12:57,010 --> 00:12:58,230
This is impossible.

184
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:00,040
Impossible.

185
00:13:11,630 --> 00:13:12,520
Guards!

186
00:13:13,240 --> 00:13:14,440
Guards!

187
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:16,530
Kill him!

188
00:13:19,250 --> 00:13:20,650
You're asking for death!

189
00:14:31,790 --> 00:14:34,030
Jin Renfeng? Why are you here?

190
00:14:35,510 --> 00:14:37,910
I'm here on behalf of Lord Jiuhuo to ask you,

191
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:39,750
when will you get

192
00:14:39,930 --> 00:14:41,530
the Twilight Mist Flower?

193
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,720
This has nothing to do with you.

194
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:45,510
You'd better mind

195
00:14:45,510 --> 00:14:47,240
your own business.

196
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:51,400
You want to keep the Twilight Mist Flower for yourself?

197
00:14:51,670 --> 00:14:52,750
So what if I do?

198
00:14:53,150 --> 00:14:54,440
And so what if I don't?

199
00:14:54,840 --> 00:14:57,000
You're overstepping your bounds.

200
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:02,720
Stop pretending.

201
00:15:03,550 --> 00:15:05,600
You and I are the same kind of people.

202
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,450
We submitted to Jiuhuo

203
00:15:07,550 --> 00:15:10,280
only because we wanted to use him and the Black Fox

204
00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:11,960
to climb higher.

205
00:15:23,320 --> 00:15:24,200
Don't worry.

206
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:27,510
Once the next round of Drunken Dream Tower's demon selection is over,

207
00:15:27,510 --> 00:15:30,270
I'll give Lord Jiuhuo an explanation.

208
00:15:43,080 --> 00:15:44,120
My Lady.

209
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:46,770
My Lady,

210
00:15:47,250 --> 00:15:49,120
we've used all the most precious antidotes

211
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:50,320
in our Ruyi Pavilion,

212
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:53,320
but the demon poison in your body still hasn't been removed—

213
00:15:53,320 --> 00:15:55,050
only temporarily suppressed.

214
00:15:55,150 --> 00:15:56,750
You're taking too big a risk.

215
00:15:59,870 --> 00:16:01,530
At least we've suppressed it.

216
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:04,510
When I get back,

217
00:16:06,120 --> 00:16:08,520
with the wealth and power of Ruyi Pavilion,

218
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:11,180
we can definitely find the catalyst.

219
00:16:11,750 --> 00:16:15,230
So after you and Master Zhang exchanged blood,

220
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:17,200
you just left him in the desert?

221
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:20,320
Don't worry.

222
00:16:21,540 --> 00:16:22,630
He won't die.

223
00:16:23,350 --> 00:16:24,280
Wait.

224
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:26,190
You've done so much for him.

225
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:27,840
Shouldn't you tell him?

226
00:16:32,270 --> 00:16:34,510
I'm not someone who serves in silence.

227
00:16:36,870 --> 00:16:38,520
I just don't want to tell him.

228
00:16:40,360 --> 00:16:41,750
The shackles on him

229
00:16:43,790 --> 00:16:45,240
are heavy enough.

230
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,200
My Lady.

231
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:51,730
Besides, I already know his feelings.

232
00:16:53,150 --> 00:16:54,680
Once we deal with his mother

233
00:16:56,150 --> 00:16:58,210
and the demon poison in me is removed,

234
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:02,250
I won't let him off the hook.

235
00:17:07,349 --> 00:17:11,710
[Demon Tamer No. 3: Tuoba Lie, second son of the Tuoba family, age 31, 8 years as a demon tamer]

236
00:17:09,829 --> 00:17:13,030
In 4 days, the Drunken Dream Tower will hold a Demon Fight.

237
00:17:13,160 --> 00:17:15,560
This is all the information we have on them.

238
00:17:16,270 --> 00:17:19,900
Hongye, if you're really going to participate,

239
00:17:19,960 --> 00:17:21,109
you must be very careful.

240
00:17:21,109 --> 00:17:22,839
It's not to be underestimated.

241
00:17:23,010 --> 00:17:23,750
Alright.

242
00:17:24,270 --> 00:17:25,240
Qingmu,

243
00:17:25,790 --> 00:17:29,160
have you made up with that man in black with the black sword?

244
00:17:30,830 --> 00:17:33,690
Thank you all again for what you did for Zhang Zheng.

245
00:17:34,510 --> 00:17:36,800
All right, I've delivered the message.

246
00:17:36,920 --> 00:17:38,030
I'll head back now.

247
00:17:44,010 --> 00:17:45,140
Qingmu?

248
00:17:49,310 --> 00:17:50,570
What's wrong with you?

249
00:17:50,680 --> 00:17:53,810
It's nothing. I've probably just been too tired lately.

250
00:17:56,920 --> 00:17:58,780
You got poisoned by demon poison?

251
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:00,970
Because of Zhang Zheng?

252
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:04,270
Even a fool can see that.

253
00:18:04,350 --> 00:18:05,640
Who else could it be?

254
00:18:05,890 --> 00:18:08,960
Please, don't tell Zhang Zheng about this.

255
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:13,170
I want him to figure out his feelings for me on his own.

256
00:18:13,270 --> 00:18:16,570
I don't want to use this as leverage to force him.

257
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:22,030
Don't worry.

258
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:24,390
I'm not that fragile.

259
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:28,000
You should focus on preparing for the Demon Fight.

260
00:18:28,030 --> 00:18:29,640
We must win this time.

261
00:18:31,750 --> 00:18:32,430
Quzhuo,

262
00:18:33,310 --> 00:18:36,770
make a magical artifact to counter demon poison immediately.

263

[Drunken Dream Tower]

[Demon Fight]

265
00:18:50,030 --> 00:18:51,930
How does it feel standing here?

266
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:55,180
Which number did you place your bet on?

267
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,130
What about you guys?

268
00:18:58,880 --> 00:18:59,720
Catch these!

269
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:09,420
Puppy Li, they are over there!

270
00:19:13,510 --> 00:19:15,950
Esteemed guests and demon tamers!

271
00:19:17,510 --> 00:19:20,000
You're too enthusiastic!

272
00:19:20,920 --> 00:19:26,310
Tonight is another good night for everyone to get drunk!

273
00:19:27,830 --> 00:19:29,510
Alright, alright, alright.

274
00:19:30,770 --> 00:19:34,100
The profiles of the participating demon tamers for tonight

275
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:36,920
have been sent to you.

276
00:19:37,110 --> 00:19:39,850
You can now

277
00:19:39,920 --> 00:19:41,610
place your bets!

278
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:45,520
Next, all demon tamers,

279
00:19:45,680 --> 00:19:47,560
please bring your demons

280
00:19:47,590 --> 00:19:49,650
to the stage.

281
00:19:50,350 --> 00:19:54,550
Get on stage! Get on stage!

282
00:19:56,170 --> 00:19:57,590
Please get on the stage!

283
00:19:58,400 --> 00:19:59,120
Let's go.

284
00:20:00,310 --> 00:20:01,200
Good!

285
00:20:01,770 --> 00:20:03,140
Let's go. We're up next.

286
00:20:12,750 --> 00:20:14,750
The winner of today's Demon Fight

287
00:20:14,830 --> 00:20:17,720
will not only receive an additional reward—an audience with the owner—

288
00:20:17,720 --> 00:20:20,610
but will also become the owner's right-hand man,

289
00:20:20,790 --> 00:20:23,990
enjoying a lifetime of glory and wealth.

290
00:20:24,040 --> 00:20:27,660
However, the rules of today's Demon Fight

291
00:20:28,790 --> 00:20:31,460
have changed.

292
00:20:32,430 --> 00:20:36,560
Today, the Demon Fight will no longer be a one-on-one battle.

293
00:20:36,610 --> 00:20:42,080
Instead, all demon tamers will enter an illusion together.

294
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:45,450
The one who obtains the treasure will be the winner.

295
00:20:45,480 --> 00:20:47,400
Bravo!

296
00:20:47,470 --> 00:20:49,440
Treasure? What is it?

297
00:20:50,680 --> 00:20:53,060
You'll know once you enter the illusion.

298
00:20:53,270 --> 00:20:55,000
So getting the treasure counts as winning?

299
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:55,720
Yes.

300
00:20:55,960 --> 00:20:57,960
Regardless of the means or methods?

301
00:20:57,960 --> 00:20:59,960
Regardless of the means or methods.

302
00:21:00,440 --> 00:21:02,770
Life and death are not restricted either.

303
00:21:03,530 --> 00:21:04,160
Alright!

304
00:21:08,310 --> 00:21:09,510
National Preceptor,

305
00:21:09,720 --> 00:21:12,710
this pair of sisters seem a bit strange.

306
00:21:13,830 --> 00:21:15,490
They are indeed a bit strange.

307
00:21:16,750 --> 00:21:17,830
But perhaps

308
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:21,860
they're the ones who can help me find the Twilight Mist Flower.

309
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:23,500
Tell them to get ready.

310
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:25,790
Once they succeed...

311
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:27,370
Understood.

312
00:21:28,270 --> 00:21:29,670
Kill them without mercy.

313
00:21:29,960 --> 00:21:34,200
The Demon Fight formation is activated!

314
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,000
With the convergence of earth veins

315
00:21:53,570 --> 00:21:55,590
and abundant spiritual energy here,

316
00:21:55,590 --> 00:21:58,160
it's indeed an ideal place for spiritual flowers and rare beasts to grow.

317
00:21:58,160 --> 00:21:59,760
Where are Qinlan and Quzhuo?

318
00:22:45,830 --> 00:22:47,090
Don't come any closer!

319
00:23:39,330 --> 00:23:41,030
Leaving this place

320
00:23:41,630 --> 00:23:43,470
won't be that easy.

321
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:12,710
Heroine, don't let go!

322
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:15,980
Fly higher!

323
00:24:17,510 --> 00:24:18,850
Stop nagging!

324
00:24:19,070 --> 00:24:20,480
If you keep making noise, I'll throw both of you down!

325
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:22,070
Qinlan, stop making noise!

326
00:24:22,270 --> 00:24:23,510
I can't hold on much longer!

327
00:24:23,510 --> 00:24:26,670
I'm not the one making noise! It's them!

328
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:30,590
Who are you?

329
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:32,310
Why are you hiding?

330
00:24:33,110 --> 00:24:35,930
I am the master of this place,

331
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:38,830
the one who holds your fate in my hands.

332
00:24:39,070 --> 00:24:41,460
You're all going to die.

333
00:24:43,830 --> 00:24:46,480
But I'll give you a chance to live.

334
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:49,640
Before the encirclement closes in,

335
00:24:50,350 --> 00:24:54,160
if one group among you kills another,

336
00:24:55,110 --> 00:24:56,920
they'll survive.

337
00:24:57,440 --> 00:24:58,970
Why should we listen to you?

338
00:25:01,310 --> 00:25:04,000
As if you have a choice.

339
00:25:09,240 --> 00:25:11,010
Either get killed,

340
00:25:11,250 --> 00:25:13,580
or all of you die.

341
00:25:14,350 --> 00:25:15,390
Kill them.

342
00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:54,420
Dongfang Divine Fire?

343
00:25:56,750 --> 00:25:59,070
She's actually Dongfang Huaizhu?

344
00:25:59,070 --> 00:26:00,000
National Preceptor,

345
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,310
if she really is Dongfang Huaizhu,

346
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:04,480
then who's her demon?

347
00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:09,600
Hurry to the Grand Palace

348
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:11,510
and request an audience with the ruler.

349
00:26:11,510 --> 00:26:12,350
Yes.

350
00:26:24,510 --> 00:26:26,160
Tuoba Yin got eliminated?

351
00:26:26,180 --> 00:26:27,830
Indeed. So useless.

352
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:33,110
He fell.

353
00:26:33,260 --> 00:26:34,630
He's dead.

354
00:26:35,620 --> 00:26:37,480
I actually had high hopes for him.

355
00:26:37,550 --> 00:26:38,850
I never expected that

356
00:26:39,160 --> 00:26:41,470
Tuoba Yin, the strongest of them all,

357
00:26:41,670 --> 00:26:43,990
was eliminated too.

358
00:26:44,350 --> 00:26:47,310
But his demon is still in the illusion.

359
00:26:48,350 --> 00:26:50,110
Distinguished guests,

360
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:52,070
what do you think we should do?

361
00:26:52,160 --> 00:26:55,440
Kill her! Kill her! Kill her!

362
00:26:55,470 --> 00:26:58,330
Kill her! Kill her! Kill her!

363
00:26:58,360 --> 00:27:01,340
Kill her! Kill her! Kill her!

364
00:27:01,370 --> 00:27:04,590
Kill her! Kill her! Kill her!

365
00:27:04,620 --> 00:27:07,460
Kill her! Kill her! Kill her!

366
00:27:07,490 --> 00:27:11,910
Kill her! Kill her! Kill her!

367
00:27:16,830 --> 00:27:18,430
Thank you for saving my life.

368
00:27:33,430 --> 00:27:39,120
Bravo! Bravo! Bravo!

369
00:27:44,630 --> 00:27:47,290
Heroine, I really can't hold on any longer.

370
00:27:47,350 --> 00:27:48,160
Qinlan,

371
00:27:48,770 --> 00:27:50,270
I can't hold on either!

372
00:27:54,960 --> 00:28:00,210
You two must hold on, even if you can't!

373
00:28:15,270 --> 00:28:16,200
Qinlan.

374
00:28:18,260 --> 00:28:20,450
I have one last thing to say to you.

375
00:28:20,590 --> 00:28:21,510
Say it!

376
00:28:23,240 --> 00:28:24,580
I...

377
00:28:28,680 --> 00:28:29,720
Interesting.

378
00:28:32,110 --> 00:28:33,910
Finally, after such a long time,

379
00:28:34,270 --> 00:28:36,440
here comes a pair of kind-hearted

380
00:28:36,560 --> 00:28:37,960
and intelligent people.

381
00:28:38,750 --> 00:28:39,990
Congratulations.

382
00:28:40,160 --> 00:28:42,590
You may enter the next round of my game

383
00:28:42,830 --> 00:28:44,740
and face my judgment.
Judgment?

384
00:28:45,240 --> 00:28:46,070
Judgment?

385
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:48,070
The Twilight Mist Flower

386
00:28:48,070 --> 00:28:50,590
belongs only to those of the purest goodness.

387
00:28:50,590 --> 00:28:52,070
I will judge

388
00:28:52,200 --> 00:28:53,800
whether you are purely good.

389
00:28:55,070 --> 00:28:56,270
There is no such thing

390
00:28:56,550 --> 00:28:58,310
as pure goodness in this world.

391
00:28:59,720 --> 00:29:02,070
Then do you dare to accept my judgment?

392
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:24,200
You have soul shards of the Black Fox within you.

393
00:29:25,310 --> 00:29:27,640
This soul is utterly evil.

394
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:29,070
Yes.

395
00:29:29,550 --> 00:29:31,350
Though you have suppressed her,

396
00:29:31,830 --> 00:29:34,170
she still resides in your blood,

397
00:29:34,270 --> 00:29:36,600
drawing power from your Spiritual Blood.

398
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:38,060
One day,

399
00:29:38,200 --> 00:29:40,350
she will rise again.

400
00:29:40,590 --> 00:29:41,640
I know.

401
00:29:42,590 --> 00:29:45,850
The Twilight Mist Flower is the purest flower in the world.

402
00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:47,440
If you obtain me,

403
00:29:47,750 --> 00:29:50,460
you can forever suppress the Black Fox.

404
00:29:52,920 --> 00:29:55,520
So this is the backup plan my mother left for me?

405
00:29:56,720 --> 00:29:58,110
Don't you hate her?

406
00:29:58,640 --> 00:30:00,000
Everything she did

407
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:02,070
must have had a reason.

408
00:30:03,040 --> 00:30:04,680
Dongfang Huaizhu,

409
00:30:05,270 --> 00:30:08,160
you can indeed be considered good.

410
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:26,240
But the person beside you

411
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:27,900
has killed countless people.

412
00:30:27,920 --> 00:30:31,310
has killed countless times. His sword is stained with countless lives.

413
00:30:31,310 --> 00:30:33,020
Wangquan Hongye,

414
00:30:33,110 --> 00:30:35,070
I judge you as evil.

415
00:30:41,640 --> 00:30:42,640
So smart.

416
00:30:43,400 --> 00:30:47,330
You immediately thought that the Twilight Mist Flower could help you.

417
00:30:47,550 --> 00:30:49,920
But the cost is high.

418
00:30:51,070 --> 00:30:52,400
If you can't awaken him,

419
00:30:53,160 --> 00:30:55,310
you'll die with him.

420
00:31:22,270 --> 00:31:24,580
[Young Wangquan Hongye]

421
00:31:30,380 --> 00:31:32,040
Hand over the Wangquan Sword,

422
00:31:32,310 --> 00:31:33,830
and I'll spare your life.

423
00:31:37,070 --> 00:31:38,350
Hongye!

424
00:31:39,510 --> 00:31:40,160
Hongye!

425
00:31:40,160 --> 00:31:41,000
Zui!

426
00:31:42,510 --> 00:31:43,880
Hongye!

427
00:31:46,310 --> 00:31:50,070
You actually betrayed Wangquan Manor as well.

428
00:31:53,310 --> 00:31:54,590
Kill him!

429
00:32:11,480 --> 00:32:13,400
I'll kill you all!

430
00:32:45,090 --> 00:32:46,910
Zui, Zui!

431
00:32:51,640 --> 00:32:53,230
Wangquan Hongye,

432
00:32:56,050 --> 00:32:58,180
you must protect Zui

433
00:33:01,180 --> 00:33:04,780
and Wangquan Manor!

434
00:33:07,160 --> 00:33:09,640
You all deserve to die.

435
00:33:10,070 --> 00:33:12,090
I'll kill you all!

436
00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:13,720
Wangquan Hongye.

437
00:33:14,440 --> 00:33:16,700
those who betrayed you are already dead.

438
00:33:16,830 --> 00:33:18,690
Wangquan Zui will grow up safely.

439
00:33:19,270 --> 00:33:21,930
You have the ability to protect Wangquan Manor.

440
00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:25,050
I will kill them all!

441
00:33:25,070 --> 00:33:25,510
I will definitely...

442
00:33:25,510 --> 00:33:29,110
You will definitely be able to protect the people you care about.

443
00:33:29,240 --> 00:33:30,700
Because you're not alone.

444
00:34:19,510 --> 00:34:20,880
Am I dreaming?

445
00:34:21,719 --> 00:34:22,679
Who are you?

446
00:34:25,690 --> 00:34:26,480
Remember,

447
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:31,440
you have never been alone.

448
00:34:47,400 --> 00:34:48,230
Huaizhu,

449
00:34:48,730 --> 00:34:50,010
what happened?

450
00:34:50,909 --> 00:34:53,360
Just now, your primordial spirit left your body,

451
00:34:53,360 --> 00:34:56,290
and you were at the closest point to becoming a demon.

452
00:34:56,550 --> 00:34:57,320
So?

453
00:34:57,840 --> 00:34:59,280
I was right, wasn't I?

454
00:34:59,670 --> 00:35:01,920
There is indeed evil in his heart.

455
00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:06,110
If the flower spirit had been so arbitrary in judging good and evil,

456
00:35:06,110 --> 00:35:07,800
it wouldn't have given me the chance

457
00:35:07,800 --> 00:35:09,730
to enter Hongye's consciousness.

458
00:35:10,840 --> 00:35:11,980
Very good.

459
00:35:12,440 --> 00:35:14,110
I like smart people.

460
00:35:16,880 --> 00:35:17,840
Not just for me.

461
00:35:18,230 --> 00:35:19,560
If it were someone else,

462
00:35:19,790 --> 00:35:22,150
my Huaizhu would still step forward.

463
00:35:23,360 --> 00:35:24,960
Because she is just that kind

464
00:35:27,070 --> 00:35:28,070
of good person.

465
00:35:50,670 --> 00:35:52,070
I'm dead?

466
00:35:58,070 --> 00:36:00,380
Where am I, Qinlan?

467
00:36:03,070 --> 00:36:04,550
Qinlan?

468
00:36:06,510 --> 00:36:07,710
Li Quzhuo,

469
00:36:08,360 --> 00:36:10,780
Get off me!

470
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:15,920
Dongfang Huaizhu,

471
00:36:16,070 --> 00:36:18,440
your mother, Jiang Juanxue, was right.

472
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:22,440
You are indeed qualified to be the master of the Twilight Mist Flower.

473
00:36:22,440 --> 00:36:24,550
You've passed my test.

474
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:27,460
My mother...

475
00:36:27,710 --> 00:36:29,070
has been here before?

476
00:36:29,480 --> 00:36:30,360
Yes.

477
00:36:31,190 --> 00:36:32,510
Do you want to see her?

478
00:36:33,590 --> 00:36:34,110
Huaizhu!

479
00:36:34,110 --> 00:36:34,630
Hongye!

480
00:36:36,230 --> 00:36:36,800
Qinlan.

481
00:36:37,800 --> 00:36:38,190
How are you?

482
00:36:38,190 --> 00:36:38,880
Quzhuo.

483
00:36:38,960 --> 00:36:40,070
-Are you hurt?
-Are you okay?

484
00:36:40,070 --> 00:36:41,230
It was too dangerous.

485
00:36:41,230 --> 00:36:43,360
Is she also Jiang Juanxue's daughter?

486
00:36:43,710 --> 00:36:45,570
Are you the Twilight Mist Flower?

487
00:36:45,800 --> 00:36:47,760
How does it know our mother's name?

488
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:50,860
The Twilight Mist Flower is the purest in the world,

489
00:36:51,290 --> 00:36:52,890
born with the earth's veins.

490
00:36:53,800 --> 00:36:55,760
I am the spirit of the Twilight Mist Flower,

491
00:36:55,760 --> 00:36:59,510
but I have never been able to grow into a mature Twilight Mist Flower.

492
00:36:59,510 --> 00:37:01,330
Ten years ago,

493
00:37:01,400 --> 00:37:04,440
your mother, Jiang Juanxue, came here.

494
00:37:05,190 --> 00:37:08,960
She said she was willing to give up all her spiritual energy and her life

495
00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:11,440
to help me fully mature within ten years.

496
00:37:12,280 --> 00:37:15,360
She truly endured great suffering for this.

497
00:37:15,380 --> 00:37:19,480
When she left this place, she was almost drained of everything.

498
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:23,290
I thought I had met the purest goodness in the world.

499
00:37:23,710 --> 00:37:25,480
But she was cunning and deceitful,

500
00:37:25,480 --> 00:37:26,710
setting up a barrier

501
00:37:26,930 --> 00:37:28,610
to trap me here

502
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:30,260
and making me wait for you.

503
00:37:31,150 --> 00:37:33,000
Both her goodness and evil

504
00:37:33,110 --> 00:37:34,670
were because of you.

505
00:37:35,590 --> 00:37:37,570
So, is the word "daughter"

506
00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:39,610
really that important?

507
00:37:39,880 --> 00:37:43,240
This is a question I've never been able to understand.

508
00:37:43,440 --> 00:37:46,240
That's why I left a little of her spiritual energy,

509
00:37:46,280 --> 00:37:48,550
so she could speak to you herself.

510
00:37:48,630 --> 00:37:49,800
Follow me.

511
00:38:15,070 --> 00:38:15,820
You...

512
00:38:15,840 --> 00:38:16,630
Move aside!

513
00:38:17,360 --> 00:38:18,520
By order of the King!

514
00:38:18,590 --> 00:38:20,710
All unauthorized personnel, leave immediately!

515
00:38:20,710 --> 00:38:21,150
Leave!

516
00:38:21,240 --> 00:38:21,890
Go, go!

517
00:38:21,960 --> 00:38:23,280
-Leave!
-Leave!
