[Love in Pavilion]

00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:50,650
[Episode 4]

3
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:06,120
Hongye,

4
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:08,910
what are you doing at our sword furnace

5
00:02:08,910 --> 00:02:10,370
in the middle of the night?

6
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:12,680
I was drunk

7
00:02:12,700 --> 00:02:14,050
and went out for a walk.

8
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:15,240
Suddenly, I wondered

9
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:17,430
what method you used to forge swords with demon cores,

10
00:02:17,430 --> 00:02:18,630
so I ended up here.

11
00:02:20,050 --> 00:02:21,190
But I didn't expect

12
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:23,800
your little sword attendant to ring

13
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:27,060
the Soul-ringing Bone Bell to warn me while I was off guard.

14
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:34,280
Master,

15
00:02:35,710 --> 00:02:37,310
Young Master Wangquan used an invisibility talisman

16
00:02:37,310 --> 00:02:38,750
and slipped out of my sight.

17
00:02:38,750 --> 00:02:39,960
When I followed him to the sword furnace,

18
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:42,190
he had already broken through the Mystical Bell Formation,

19
00:02:42,190 --> 00:02:44,520
so I immediately triggered the bone bell.

20
00:02:49,170 --> 00:02:50,820
Oh, Hongye.

21
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:53,050
You could've just told me you wanted to take a look.

22
00:02:53,050 --> 00:02:54,910
Why did you sneak around like that

23
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:58,079
and make us all scramble?

24
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:00,520
It was just a whim.

25
00:03:00,870 --> 00:03:01,670
But I must say,

26
00:03:02,310 --> 00:03:04,890
this little sword attendant of your Nangong family is foolishly loyal.

27
00:03:04,890 --> 00:03:06,030
She ruined my mood.

28
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:09,240
If you don't like her,

29
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:11,800
I'll have someone else serve you right away.

30
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:12,360
No.

31
00:03:13,430 --> 00:03:14,910
I prefer those

32
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:22,680
with a bit of fire in them.

33
00:03:25,870 --> 00:03:26,430
Let's go.

34
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:46,000
Father.

35
00:03:47,610 --> 00:03:50,270
You've checked it like a hundred times already.

36
00:03:51,650 --> 00:03:53,170
The sword furnace is fine.

37
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,800
The divine sword will definitely be ready on time tomorrow.

38
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,310
Wangquan Hongye

39
00:04:00,750 --> 00:04:03,150
is more calculating than you think.

40
00:04:04,630 --> 00:04:06,290
The more critical the moment,

41
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:08,560
the more cautious we must be.

42
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:10,750
Father,

43
00:04:11,430 --> 00:04:13,360
don't worry.

44
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:18,500
This divine sword is forged with a divine bird's demon core

45
00:04:18,630 --> 00:04:20,230
and refined with demon fire.

46
00:04:20,430 --> 00:04:21,430
Once it's complete,

47
00:04:21,430 --> 00:04:22,630
it will be able

48
00:04:22,630 --> 00:04:23,920
to slay anyone.

49
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:25,310
Even if Wangquan Hongye

50
00:04:25,310 --> 00:04:27,570
can truly wield the Unparalleled Sword,

51
00:04:27,950 --> 00:04:29,560
we'll have nothing to fear.

52
00:04:31,310 --> 00:04:32,360
Besides,

53
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:35,750
we still have the Dongfang Divine Fire.

54
00:04:36,870 --> 00:04:38,830
Nothing will go wrong.

55
00:04:39,750 --> 00:04:40,600
Indeed.

56
00:04:40,990 --> 00:04:43,310
If it weren't for Dongfang Huaizhu,

57
00:04:43,950 --> 00:04:47,240
something might have gone wrong with the sword furnace today.

58
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:50,170
But the Mystical Bell Formation has been destroyed.

59
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:54,720
I'll have you take people to guard the sword furnace.

60
00:04:54,900 --> 00:04:55,800
Yes.

61
00:04:56,920 --> 00:04:59,950
Send more people to keep watch on Wangquan Hongye.

62
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:02,390
There must be no more accidents.

63
00:05:02,390 --> 00:05:02,920
Yes.

64
00:05:18,390 --> 00:05:20,390
You didn't say anything all the way.

65
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:22,360
What's wrong?

66
00:05:23,750 --> 00:05:24,550
Are you angry?

67
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:38,170
You really are angry.

68
00:05:40,870 --> 00:05:43,330
You're thinking about how confident you are

69
00:05:43,710 --> 00:05:45,510
in leaving me behind to save Nan.

70
00:05:47,550 --> 00:05:49,390
So, you only want to save Nan

71
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:51,730
and don't care about the other demons.

72
00:06:06,430 --> 00:06:08,970
Can I have a cup of water?

73
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:18,760
Thank you, Miss Huaizhu,

74
00:06:18,830 --> 00:06:21,450
for choosing me outside the sword furnace.

75
00:06:22,740 --> 00:06:25,360
Are you sure you can save all the demons,

76
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:27,070
including Nan?

77
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:29,370
There is no perfect plan in this world.

78
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:32,270
But if you're willing to help me heal my wounds,

79
00:06:32,830 --> 00:06:34,360
I'll have a better chance.

80
00:06:36,190 --> 00:06:38,450
Why must the sword forging be completed?

81
00:06:38,450 --> 00:06:40,080
Why don't you let me save Nan?

82
00:06:40,290 --> 00:06:42,510
Even if you risk your life to save Nan,

83
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:44,510
as long as they keep using demon cores to forge swords,

84
00:06:44,510 --> 00:06:46,110
there will be countless Nans

85
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:48,650
dying in the noble families' sword furnaces.

86
00:06:52,570 --> 00:06:54,630
I have some knowledge of formations.

87
00:06:54,650 --> 00:06:56,750
The Silk-Wound Kasyapa Bell was originally

88
00:06:56,750 --> 00:07:00,010
a hallucinatory bell used by the spider demons of Nanchui.

89
00:07:00,190 --> 00:07:01,560
At today's banquet,

90
00:07:01,580 --> 00:07:04,910
it was used by the Nangong family to set up a sound formation,

91
00:07:05,250 --> 00:07:07,190
[Nangong Sword Furnace]

92
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:07,700
which was similar to the Mystical Bell Formation

93
00:07:07,700 --> 00:07:09,230
outside the sword furnace.

94
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:15,780
This Bell Sound Formation

95
00:07:15,810 --> 00:07:17,430
drew power from

96
00:07:17,450 --> 00:07:20,360
the four great demon cores sacrificed by Nangong Ye at the banquet.

97
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:22,400
The reason it only hurt you

98
00:07:22,420 --> 00:07:24,360
was due to the careful arrangement

99
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:26,360
of your seat.

100
00:07:26,510 --> 00:07:28,000
When the bell formation was triggered,

101
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,940
the sound waves were reflected

102
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:32,230
by the screen and converged on you.

103
00:07:32,870 --> 00:07:36,130
Only by tomorrow, when the four demon swords are forged

104
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:39,159
and Nangong Ye holds the sword unveiling ceremony,

105
00:07:39,159 --> 00:07:41,960
will it be possible to reverse the sound formation

106
00:07:42,159 --> 00:07:43,890
and allow you to fully recover.

107
00:07:44,750 --> 00:07:46,010
Then can you guarantee

108
00:07:46,510 --> 00:07:49,830
that the Bell Sound Formation will be reactivated tomorrow?

109
00:07:49,830 --> 00:07:50,870
Of course not.

110
00:07:51,770 --> 00:07:55,050
However, you can stand at the center of the formation,

111
00:07:55,310 --> 00:07:57,110
where the sound waves converge,

112
00:07:57,640 --> 00:08:00,640
and I will be able to restart the Bell Sound Formation.

113
00:08:02,430 --> 00:08:03,630
After leaving your seat,

114
00:08:03,630 --> 00:08:05,040
take five steps, turn right,

115
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:06,840
and then take ten steps forward.

116
00:08:06,950 --> 00:08:08,560
Ten steps forward?

117
00:08:11,630 --> 00:08:13,160
That's the situation.

118
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:16,190
The sword unveiling ceremony tomorrow

119
00:08:16,190 --> 00:08:18,510
is my only chance to treat your injuries.

120
00:08:18,810 --> 00:08:21,070
What condition did Nangong Ye offer you?

121
00:08:21,510 --> 00:08:22,600
Can you tell me?

122
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:24,750
If I help you win,

123
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:26,360
please save

124
00:08:26,630 --> 00:08:29,160
a prisoner from the Inspection Bureau for me.

125
00:08:29,190 --> 00:08:29,950
No problem.

126
00:08:31,270 --> 00:08:33,799
Aren't you going to ask me who the prisoner is?

127
00:08:34,030 --> 00:08:36,230
The person you desperately want to save

128
00:08:36,330 --> 00:08:38,330
must not be a bad person.

129
00:08:44,940 --> 00:08:46,870
Thank you, Young Master Wangquan.

130
00:08:48,030 --> 00:08:49,090
It's getting late.

131
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:51,560
You'll have a tough battle tomorrow.

132
00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:52,360
Get some rest.

133
00:09:11,570 --> 00:09:13,170
Young Master, you're awake?

134
00:09:13,870 --> 00:09:17,630
You slept sitting up all night.

135
00:09:18,070 --> 00:09:21,400
You must have felt uneasy.

136
00:09:26,910 --> 00:09:28,380
You're very observant

137
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:30,130
and eloquent.

138
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:31,910
It's truly impressive.

139
00:09:32,340 --> 00:09:33,620
Actually,

140
00:09:34,130 --> 00:09:35,930
I didn't sleep the entire night.

141
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:37,200
Why?

142
00:09:39,690 --> 00:09:41,450
You are good at scheming,

143
00:09:42,210 --> 00:09:43,330
and I admire that.

144
00:09:43,620 --> 00:09:44,940
I just worry that

145
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:47,200
if I heal your injuries,

146
00:09:47,220 --> 00:09:49,600
I'll lose all control over you.

147
00:09:50,470 --> 00:09:54,000
So, you're afraid I'll cross the river and tear down the bridge.

148
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:55,920
Well, I have a suggestion.

149
00:09:56,210 --> 00:09:57,870
You can feed me a poison pill,

150
00:09:57,890 --> 00:09:58,570
and that way…

151
00:09:58,570 --> 00:10:00,440
Young Master, that's a good reminder.

152
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:02,150
This is a Peacock Gall Poison Pill.

153
00:10:02,150 --> 00:10:03,410
Please, Young Master.

154
00:10:06,750 --> 00:10:07,880
What a coincidence.

155
00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:09,890
Compared to weightless promises,

156
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:11,440
I trust it more.

157
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:15,660
Young Master, you're quite decisive.

158
00:10:15,660 --> 00:10:17,260
Instead of mutual suspicion

159
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:18,440
and distrust,

160
00:10:19,150 --> 00:10:20,320
I trust you more.

161
00:10:28,060 --> 00:10:31,660
[Nangong Sword Furnace]

162
00:10:36,590 --> 00:10:38,520
Hongye has already broken the Mystical Bell Formation.

163
00:10:38,520 --> 00:10:40,780
Now it's up to us.

164
00:10:59,370 --> 00:11:00,360
There are four guards inside,

165
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:01,440
all of whom have mediocre powers.

166
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:03,510
The other one should be Nangong Chui.

167
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:07,080
Nangong Ye can barely hold his own against Hongye,

168
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:10,280
and Nangong Chui is just a nobody who's not worth fearing.

169
00:11:10,510 --> 00:11:12,910
Are you confident in controlling his mind?

170
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:16,580
I underestimated our Zui.

171
00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:18,470
Let me make it clear first.

172
00:11:18,470 --> 00:11:20,470
Nangong Chui is mine.

173
00:11:21,270 --> 00:11:21,870
Let's go.

174
00:11:26,150 --> 00:11:29,350
There's less than an hour left until the auspicious time.

175
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:32,950
Will this little one work or not?

176
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:34,910
Young Master,

00:11:50,630 --> 00:11:52,240
it's so early in the morning.

180
00:11:52,270 --> 00:11:55,180
Are you trying to accompany me while I'm drinking?

181
00:12:03,830 --> 00:12:06,360
Next time when you want to speak so disrespectfully,

182
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:10,220
think carefully about whether you can speak to just anyone like that.

183
00:12:24,030 --> 00:12:25,260
So disobedient.

184
00:12:34,270 --> 00:12:35,740
Her demonic energy has been almost completely exhausted,

185
00:12:35,740 --> 00:12:37,540
and now she's barely conscious.

186
00:12:53,510 --> 00:12:55,710
The demon swords are about to be forged.

00:13:06,410 --> 00:13:07,940
the demons' malicious energy is sinking.

189
00:13:07,940 --> 00:13:11,550
The Li family's Spirit-purifying Mirror is used to purify the malicious energy.

190
00:13:11,550 --> 00:13:13,810
It's placed at the bottom of the furnace.

191
00:13:14,430 --> 00:13:15,810
According to Quzhuo,

192
00:13:16,030 --> 00:13:17,080
this Eight-Diagram Mirror should be able to

193
00:13:17,080 --> 00:13:21,140
stop the Spirit-purifying Mirror from purifying the malicious energy.

194
00:13:30,150 --> 00:13:31,310
It's done.

195
00:13:31,530 --> 00:13:33,080
The sword unveiling ceremony will begin soon.

196
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:34,740
The sword in Nangong Ye's hand

197
00:13:34,760 --> 00:13:37,620
will be an evil sword filled with malicious energy.

198
00:13:41,500 --> 00:13:42,260
Zui.

199
00:13:43,030 --> 00:13:44,480
Go and change their memories,

200
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:45,910
I'll sever the spell chain.

201
00:13:45,910 --> 00:13:46,440
Okay.

202
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:14,780
Yitan!

203
00:14:19,290 --> 00:14:20,230
You have the Heavenly Eye,

204
00:14:20,230 --> 00:14:22,740
so you must know that severing the spell chain will cause the demon fire to backfire.

205
00:14:22,740 --> 00:14:24,270
That's why you sent me away.

206
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:27,330
Fortunately, I saved her life.

207
00:14:28,790 --> 00:14:29,610
I'm fine.

208
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:31,980
Go and change their memories.

209
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:36,200
Okay, I'll go then.

210
00:15:02,140 --> 00:15:04,970
Read after me from now on.

211
00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:06,740
Today, the swords are completed.

212
00:15:06,740 --> 00:15:08,670
Nan couldn't bear the pain

213
00:15:08,690 --> 00:15:10,360
and jumped into the furnace and died.

214
00:15:10,360 --> 00:15:12,600
Today, the swords are completed.

215
00:15:12,620 --> 00:15:15,930
Nan couldn't bear the pain

216
00:15:16,070 --> 00:15:18,080
and jumped into the furnace and died.

217
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:18,960
Good boys.

218
00:15:25,900 --> 00:15:29,400
The major noble families have long been in cahoots with Nangong.

219
00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:32,400
Are you truly confident that you can suppress Nangong

220
00:15:32,460 --> 00:15:35,460
and save all the demons being used to forge the swords?

221
00:15:35,620 --> 00:15:36,950
Let's change the topic.

222
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,530
This is quite a mood killer.

223
00:15:39,950 --> 00:15:40,590
True.

224
00:15:41,530 --> 00:15:42,840
Then how about we talk about

225
00:15:42,840 --> 00:15:45,240
the Peacock Gall Poison Pill you just took?

226
00:15:45,960 --> 00:15:48,150
You won't feel anything when it first enters your body,

227
00:15:48,150 --> 00:15:49,550
but as time passes,

228
00:15:49,790 --> 00:15:52,630
your blood will gradually clot in your veins.

229
00:15:53,150 --> 00:15:54,200
Without an antidote...

230
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:55,150
My death...

231
00:15:58,980 --> 00:16:00,320
will be a terrible sight, right?

232
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:02,050
Your corpse will be crystal blue.

233
00:16:02,050 --> 00:16:03,710
It's quite pretty, actually.

234
00:16:16,230 --> 00:16:17,120
I see.

235
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:18,870
We'll...

236
00:16:20,840 --> 00:16:22,010
see in the future.

237
00:16:39,520 --> 00:16:42,730
Did the little demon really jump into the furnace and die?

238
00:16:42,930 --> 00:16:43,590
Yes.

239
00:16:43,750 --> 00:16:44,910
Today, the swords are completed.

240
00:16:44,910 --> 00:16:46,480
Nan couldn't bear the pain

241
00:16:46,510 --> 00:16:48,440
and jumped into the furnace and died.

242
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:50,680
Then why does my leg hurt so much?

243
00:16:51,320 --> 00:16:53,320
It feels like I've been beaten.

244
00:16:55,400 --> 00:16:57,220
Young Master, the auspicious time is coming.

245
00:16:57,220 --> 00:16:59,240
Master asks if the swords are ready.

246
00:16:59,900 --> 00:17:01,290
Tell the Master

247
00:17:03,050 --> 00:17:05,180
the Heavenly Swords have been forged,

248
00:17:05,319 --> 00:17:06,810
and we can draw them at the auspicious time.

249
00:17:06,810 --> 00:17:07,430
Yes.

250
00:17:47,030 --> 00:17:51,270
[Auspiciousness and Blessings]

251
00:18:11,790 --> 00:18:13,310
The four demon swords are complete.

252
00:18:13,310 --> 00:18:15,110
Master, please draw the swords.

253
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:16,500
Invite the swords.

254
00:18:35,110 --> 00:18:36,500
I am not talented,

255
00:18:36,750 --> 00:18:39,640
but based on the unique characteristics of each family master's martial arts,

256
00:18:39,640 --> 00:18:43,220
I prepared a sword that matches each one of you.

257
00:18:43,590 --> 00:18:45,530
The materials used to forge these swords

258
00:18:45,530 --> 00:18:47,990
are all demon cores over a hundred years old.

259
00:18:48,270 --> 00:18:50,470
Everyone, please examine your swords.

260
00:19:02,790 --> 00:19:03,880
Good sword.

261
00:19:04,510 --> 00:19:05,490
Good sword.

262
00:19:06,350 --> 00:19:07,440
Good sword.

263
00:19:08,270 --> 00:19:09,760
Master Cheng's sword

264
00:19:10,070 --> 00:19:13,070
was forged with the demon core of the Eagle Demon King.

265
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:14,750
It carries a natural fierceness.

266
00:19:14,750 --> 00:19:18,410
This sword contains at least a hundred years of demonic energy.

267
00:19:18,830 --> 00:19:19,760
Master Nangong,

268
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:22,100
I, Cheng Ling, admire you!

269
00:19:26,820 --> 00:19:28,170
Young Master Wangquan,

270
00:19:28,260 --> 00:19:30,820
do you have something to say?

271
00:19:31,070 --> 00:19:34,530
Since ancient times, great swords have chosen their masters,

272
00:19:35,070 --> 00:19:37,970
and swordsmen also choose their swords.

273
00:19:38,270 --> 00:19:39,950
What do you mean?

274
00:19:40,070 --> 00:19:42,110
What else could it mean?

275
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:44,680
The conservative Wangquan Manor

276
00:19:44,750 --> 00:19:47,750
cannot stand the Nangong family's rise.

277
00:19:48,460 --> 00:19:50,350
You look down on our swords,

278
00:19:50,350 --> 00:19:51,920
but so what?

279
00:19:52,440 --> 00:19:55,240
Your Wangquan Manor only has the Wangquan Sword,

280
00:19:55,350 --> 00:19:59,070
but our Nangong family has many demon swords.

281
00:19:59,680 --> 00:20:01,610
As long as demons don't go extinct,

282
00:20:01,720 --> 00:20:03,920
there will always be more in the future.

283
00:20:06,920 --> 00:20:09,220
My son is rough with his words,

284
00:20:09,590 --> 00:20:11,520
but he makes a point.

285
00:20:11,880 --> 00:20:14,590
Master Nangong, what do you mean?

286
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:20,980
With the help of Dongfang Divine Fire,

287
00:20:21,580 --> 00:20:24,950
I will certainly be even stronger.

288
00:20:28,420 --> 00:20:30,820
I also have a Celestial Demon Divine Sword.

289
00:20:31,020 --> 00:20:33,820
I would like to invite you all to examine the sword!

290
00:21:27,390 --> 00:21:28,680
[Auspiciousness and Blessings]

291
00:21:34,820 --> 00:21:37,620
Raise the banner and challenge the Alliance Leader.

292
00:21:37,620 --> 00:21:40,010
Master Nangong Ye, is this what you mean?

293
00:21:40,440 --> 00:21:41,240
Indeed.

294
00:21:42,110 --> 00:21:44,590
Then you should take your Nangong family's banner

295
00:21:44,590 --> 00:21:45,960
and challenge the headquarters of the Yiqi Alliance,

296
00:21:45,960 --> 00:21:47,420
Wangquan Manor.

297
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:12,590
When raising the banner and challenging the Alliance Leader,

298
00:22:12,590 --> 00:22:13,920
killing is acceptable.

299
00:22:14,590 --> 00:22:16,900
This is a rule set by the Yiqi Alliance.

300
00:22:17,720 --> 00:22:20,340
Since I want to change the rules,

301
00:22:20,750 --> 00:22:22,750
why do I have to stick to the old ways?

302
00:22:22,830 --> 00:22:24,620
The headquarters of Yiqi Alliance

303
00:22:24,620 --> 00:22:27,080
could also be my Nangong's residence.

304
00:22:28,070 --> 00:22:29,280
Family masters,

305
00:22:29,510 --> 00:22:30,590
what do you think?

306
00:22:45,960 --> 00:22:47,870
Today, I, Nangong Ye,

307
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:49,790
raise my sword

308
00:22:50,070 --> 00:22:53,800
to challenge Wangquan Hongye for the position of Alliance Leader.

309
00:22:54,160 --> 00:22:57,090
This battle will be perilous and life-threatening.

310
00:22:57,350 --> 00:22:58,680
Young Master Wangquan,

311
00:22:59,640 --> 00:23:01,590
do you dare to accept the challenge?

312
00:23:01,590 --> 00:23:02,860
If you dare not,

313
00:23:03,030 --> 00:23:04,830
sever the Wangquan Sword first!

314
00:23:34,310 --> 00:23:35,640
After leaving the seat,

315
00:23:36,110 --> 00:23:37,710
take five steps, turn right,

316
00:23:38,050 --> 00:23:39,300
and then take

317
00:23:39,720 --> 00:23:40,780
ten steps forward.

318
00:24:03,510 --> 00:24:04,840
Young Master Wangquan,

319
00:24:05,720 --> 00:24:07,320
do you have to be so arrogant?

320
00:24:55,510 --> 00:24:57,920
If you want to challenge the Wangquan Sword,

321
00:24:57,920 --> 00:24:58,920
it depends on

322
00:24:59,550 --> 00:25:01,720
whether you have the ability.

323
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:31,460
The Wangquan Sword isn't that powerful.

324
00:25:31,470 --> 00:25:32,900
The Yiqi Alliance

325
00:25:33,550 --> 00:25:35,480
will belong to the Nangong family.

326
00:25:36,350 --> 00:25:39,110
Young Master Wangquan, swords are ruthless.

327
00:25:39,240 --> 00:25:40,640
You still have time to admit defeat

328
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:42,510
and sever the Wangquan Sword.

329
00:26:11,190 --> 00:26:12,410
All swords

330
00:26:15,350 --> 00:26:16,230
unite as one!

331
00:26:31,720 --> 00:26:34,000
What is the meaning of the Wangquan Sword?

332
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,350
When the sword is drawn, all swords obey.

333
00:26:36,600 --> 00:26:38,730
Want to challenge the Wangquan Sword?

334
00:26:38,810 --> 00:26:39,880
Nangong Ye,

335
00:26:40,330 --> 00:26:41,460
do you deserve it?

336
00:26:49,040 --> 00:26:50,170
It was you.

337
00:26:51,030 --> 00:26:53,830
You broke the formation and saved him!

338
00:27:04,440 --> 00:27:06,960
Your only opponent is me.

339
00:27:08,190 --> 00:27:09,640
Ten years ago,

340
00:27:10,530 --> 00:27:12,830
I lost to Wangquan Shouzhuo

341
00:27:13,640 --> 00:27:16,610
because I wasn't ruthless enough.

342
00:27:17,790 --> 00:27:19,210
Today,

343
00:27:19,590 --> 00:27:22,910
I won't lose to this little boy!

344
00:27:30,530 --> 00:27:31,660
Something's wrong.

345
00:27:33,510 --> 00:27:35,000
I am...

346
00:27:35,730 --> 00:27:38,170
the strongest in the world!

347
00:27:48,690 --> 00:27:50,090
None of you...

348
00:27:50,590 --> 00:27:53,020
can stop me!

349
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:00,920
Father!

350
00:28:03,320 --> 00:28:05,590
He's gone mad! He even killed his own son!

351
00:28:06,300 --> 00:28:08,350
Using demon cores to forge swords can really cause backfires!

352
00:28:08,350 --> 00:28:09,410
Let's go! Let's go!

353
00:28:27,030 --> 00:28:28,060
Wangquan Hongye!

354
00:28:28,110 --> 00:28:28,900
Enough!

355
00:29:16,110 --> 00:29:18,640
Miss Xie, use the Divine Fire to set them free.

eternal night befalls.

None of you can escape.

359

Forsaking emotions, pursuing hatred;

360
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:49,940
eternal night befalls.

361
00:29:50,800 --> 00:29:51,870
Hongye,

362
00:29:52,320 --> 00:29:53,850
you must remember my words.

363
00:29:54,160 --> 00:29:56,340
Stop the conflict between humans and demons

364
00:29:56,340 --> 00:29:58,940
and prevent the eternal night from befalling.

[Auspiciousness and Blessings]

366
00:30:25,590 --> 00:30:26,680
Congratulations, Young Master,

[Sword Attendant Feng]

368
00:30:26,790 --> 00:30:28,250
for fulfilling your wish.

369
00:30:28,510 --> 00:30:29,640
I'll leave

370
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:31,260
the rest to you.

00:31:25,740 --> 00:31:26,930
Miss Huaizhu,

374
00:31:27,590 --> 00:31:29,780
I called you here to inform you

375
00:31:29,860 --> 00:31:31,390
that Nan has been rescued.

376
00:31:31,680 --> 00:31:34,000
Yitan and Zui have already taken Nan to Tushan.

377
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:35,350
There's a demon market

378
00:31:35,350 --> 00:31:37,200
that shelters homeless demons.

379
00:31:37,840 --> 00:31:39,070
If that is the case,

380
00:31:39,410 --> 00:31:41,270
I, Dongfang Huaizhu, would like to thank you

381
00:31:41,270 --> 00:31:43,270
on behalf of Nan and the other demons

382
00:31:43,330 --> 00:31:44,590
who have been saved.

383
00:31:47,810 --> 00:31:49,290
In a single day,

384
00:31:49,320 --> 00:31:52,000
you wiped out the Nangong noble family without leaving a trace.

385
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:54,530
You are truly a remarkable person, capable of

386
00:31:54,540 --> 00:31:56,200
turning the tides of fate with a single motion.

387
00:31:56,200 --> 00:31:57,760
Are you insinuating

388
00:31:59,160 --> 00:32:00,690
that I am not a good person?

389
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:02,310
Someone like you,

390
00:32:02,310 --> 00:32:04,310
standing at the center of the storm,

391
00:32:04,680 --> 00:32:07,010
cannot be described simply as good or bad.

392
00:32:09,070 --> 00:32:10,070
I see.

393
00:32:10,780 --> 00:32:11,970
What you mean is that

394
00:32:13,640 --> 00:32:15,500
we are not the same kind of people.

395
00:32:16,830 --> 00:32:19,490
What do you think about the words Nangong Ye said

396
00:32:19,920 --> 00:32:21,110
before his death?

397
00:32:26,550 --> 00:32:27,350
Young Master.

398
00:32:31,970 --> 00:32:33,410
[Young Master, Mu Xiaowu, the person you had me investigate, was arrested]

399
00:32:31,970 --> 00:32:33,410
[by the Inspection Bureau days ago on charges of unlawfully releasing demon slaves and is currently detained in their prison.]

400
00:32:33,690 --> 00:32:35,350
The person you're looking for

401
00:32:36,710 --> 00:32:38,710
is indeed in the Inspection Bureau.

402
00:32:41,930 --> 00:32:43,850
[Yiqi Alliance]
[Inspection Bureau]

403
00:32:51,110 --> 00:32:53,880
The Inspection Bureau is independent from the Yiqi Alliance.

404
00:32:53,880 --> 00:32:56,020
Are you planning to go there alone

405
00:32:56,040 --> 00:32:57,480
to rescue him?

406
00:32:58,880 --> 00:32:59,550
Let's go.

407
00:33:40,850 --> 00:33:41,940
Bring someone out?

408
00:33:42,110 --> 00:33:43,160
Who?

409
00:33:43,920 --> 00:33:44,880
Mu Xiaowu.

410
00:33:45,590 --> 00:33:48,520
This is the release document from the Yiqi Alliance.

411
00:33:49,240 --> 00:33:50,570
Who is Mu Xiaowu?

412
00:33:50,750 --> 00:33:52,460
His real name is Mu Renzhi.

413
00:33:52,790 --> 00:33:55,250
[Yiqi Alliance]
[Director of Inspection Bureau]

414
00:33:52,960 --> 00:33:54,890
He is the fifth-born in his family,

415
00:33:55,020 --> 00:33:56,950
so everyone calls him Mu Xiaowu.

416
00:34:00,270 --> 00:34:01,820
So what if there's a document?

417
00:34:01,820 --> 00:34:02,590
Even with a document,

418
00:34:02,590 --> 00:34:05,000
you still have to follow the rules of the Inspection Bureau.

419
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:06,440
Let's calculate.

420
00:34:10,150 --> 00:34:11,150
Is this person male or female?

421
00:34:11,150 --> 00:34:12,440
How long have they been here?

422
00:34:12,440 --> 00:34:13,230
Male.

423
00:34:13,550 --> 00:34:15,320
He has probably been here for less than half a month.

424
00:34:15,320 --> 00:34:16,270
A male

425
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:19,730
means he is capable of working.

426
00:34:20,110 --> 00:34:21,110
Here,

427
00:34:21,110 --> 00:34:22,960
his starting price for release is 300 taels.

428
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:24,900
His daily expenses are 2.2 taels.

429
00:34:25,510 --> 00:34:26,920
He has been here for 15 days.

430
00:34:26,920 --> 00:34:28,710
15 days is...

431
00:34:29,429 --> 00:34:30,560
3 multiplied by 5...

432
00:34:30,630 --> 00:34:33,810
Then, add an inspection fee.

433
00:34:34,230 --> 00:34:36,230
This, rounded off,

434
00:34:36,840 --> 00:34:38,719
comes to around 400 taels.

435
00:34:39,190 --> 00:34:41,150
After paying and completing the registration,

436
00:34:41,150 --> 00:34:42,360
you can bring him out in ten days.

437
00:34:42,360 --> 00:34:43,400
It costs money

438
00:34:43,630 --> 00:34:44,889
to be imprisoned here?

439
00:34:47,630 --> 00:34:48,550
What?

440
00:34:48,670 --> 00:34:51,190
Are you saying that eating, drinking, and other needs here don't cost money?

441
00:34:51,190 --> 00:34:53,880
Then why do we need to wait for 10 days to bring him out?

442
00:34:53,880 --> 00:34:54,630
Why?

443
00:34:55,110 --> 00:34:56,920
I have so many people imprisoned here.

444
00:34:56,920 --> 00:34:57,800
I need to release them one by one.

445
00:34:57,800 --> 00:34:58,800
Doesn't it need

446
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:00,180
verification?

447
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:02,030
What if I release the wrong person one day?

448
00:35:02,030 --> 00:35:03,710
Who's going to take responsibility

449
00:35:03,710 --> 00:35:05,160
for that, you or you?

450
00:35:05,880 --> 00:35:06,670
Cut the crap.

451
00:35:06,960 --> 00:35:08,290
Pay the money and leave.

452
00:35:08,510 --> 00:35:09,430
Miss Huaizhu,

453
00:35:10,440 --> 00:35:12,100
what do you think we should do?

454
00:35:13,440 --> 00:35:16,190
Young Master, I came in a rush

455
00:35:16,510 --> 00:35:18,280
and didn't bring that much money.

456
00:35:18,280 --> 00:35:19,320
Why don't we

457
00:35:19,400 --> 00:35:22,030
use your sword to offset the cost?

458
00:35:26,450 --> 00:35:27,440
Come on. What are you two

459
00:35:27,440 --> 00:35:28,630
whispering about?

460
00:35:29,880 --> 00:35:31,320
You think you can just use a stupid sword

461
00:35:31,320 --> 00:35:33,270
to offset 400 taels of silver?

462
00:35:33,510 --> 00:35:35,110
Do you think your sword is...

463
00:35:38,710 --> 00:35:39,640
The wangquan...

464
00:35:41,530 --> 00:35:42,660
The Wangquan Sword?

465
00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:46,240
Young Master, aren't you at Nangong's residence?

466
00:35:47,400 --> 00:35:48,910
You're well-informed.

467
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:51,900
Have you also placed your bets on Nangong Ye,

468
00:35:52,070 --> 00:35:53,510
hoping that the Yiqi Alliance

469
00:35:53,510 --> 00:35:56,880
will change its leader?

470
00:35:56,900 --> 00:35:57,820
I dare not.

471
00:36:05,140 --> 00:36:06,430
Within ten counts,

472
00:36:07,400 --> 00:36:08,660
I want to see Mu Xiaowu.

473
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:10,880
Otherwise...

474
00:36:19,940 --> 00:36:21,900
[Mu Xiaowu]

475
00:36:21,550 --> 00:36:22,360
Yan.

476
00:36:24,590 --> 00:36:25,330
Yan!

477
00:36:26,760 --> 00:36:27,550
Xiaowu?

478
00:36:29,080 --> 00:36:29,630
How have you been?

479
00:36:29,630 --> 00:36:30,150
Yan!

480
00:36:33,080 --> 00:36:35,010
A couple eventually got together.

481
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:36,980
It can be considered a good story.

482
00:36:36,980 --> 00:36:38,670
It's too early to say that.

483
00:36:41,370 --> 00:36:43,540
Yitan's grandfather is proud

484
00:36:43,630 --> 00:36:45,090
and values bloodlines greatly.

485
00:36:45,090 --> 00:36:46,980
Someone as ordinary as Mu Xiaowu

486
00:36:47,230 --> 00:36:48,830
is unlikely to catch his eye.

487
00:36:49,610 --> 00:36:51,140
Success depends on effort.

488
00:36:51,470 --> 00:36:54,220
Some things are worth fighting for.

489
00:36:57,040 --> 00:36:58,150
No matter what,

490
00:36:58,440 --> 00:37:00,280
I've brought out the person you mentioned.

491
00:37:00,280 --> 00:37:02,510
Now, can you cure me of the poison?

492
00:37:04,240 --> 00:37:05,910
Young Master, please don't rush.

493
00:37:05,910 --> 00:37:06,460
Really?

494
00:37:07,620 --> 00:37:08,510
Really?

495
00:37:09,030 --> 00:37:09,800
Yes.

496
00:37:10,220 --> 00:37:11,520
That's great, Yan!

497
00:37:11,550 --> 00:37:12,230
Be careful!

498
00:37:12,290 --> 00:37:14,070
Yan, we are having a child, Yan!

499
00:37:14,230 --> 00:37:15,400
Are we really having a child?

500
00:37:15,400 --> 00:37:16,530
Be careful.

501
00:37:17,150 --> 00:37:18,660
Just as you said,

502
00:37:19,430 --> 00:37:22,840
I don't think that just because Yan is pregnant,

503
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:25,150
Mu Xiaowu, coming from a poor family,

504
00:37:25,230 --> 00:37:26,500
would be accepted by the Yang family.

505
00:37:26,500 --> 00:37:28,030
That's great, Yan!

506
00:37:30,050 --> 00:37:31,070
Put me down.

507
00:37:32,230 --> 00:37:33,440
Don't tell me

508
00:37:33,760 --> 00:37:37,020
you want me to personally act as a matchmaker for Mu Xiaowu.

509
00:37:37,550 --> 00:37:39,440
Yes. I hope you can help.

510
00:37:40,960 --> 00:37:42,630
How far should I go?

511
00:37:42,820 --> 00:37:45,800
I can't be looking after them for their whole lives, can I?

512
00:37:45,800 --> 00:37:47,600
Within a month would be the best.

513
00:37:47,670 --> 00:37:49,070
Once they are married,

514
00:37:49,340 --> 00:37:50,690
I will cure your poison.

515
00:37:50,960 --> 00:37:52,030
A month? That soon?

516
00:37:52,670 --> 00:37:54,020
The longer we wait, the more troubles will occur.

517
00:37:54,020 --> 00:37:56,580
I owe you this one.

518
00:38:00,860 --> 00:38:02,230
This friend

519
00:38:04,200 --> 00:38:05,460
is so important to you?

520
00:38:06,540 --> 00:38:09,370
How fortunate in life it is to have a confidant.

521
00:38:10,060 --> 00:38:11,640
Yan is

522
00:38:11,800 --> 00:38:13,520
a part of my life to me.

523
00:38:15,890 --> 00:38:16,940
Miss Huaizhu,

524
00:38:29,260 --> 00:38:30,790
go back and wait for my news.

525
00:38:31,760 --> 00:38:33,890
Then I'll be waiting for the good news.

526
00:38:34,350 --> 00:38:35,750
Young Master, take care.

527
00:39:05,730 --> 00:39:06,610
Your Highness.

528
00:39:07,990 --> 00:39:09,190
As you expected,

529
00:39:09,590 --> 00:39:11,540
the conflict between humans and demons within the circle never ends,

530
00:39:11,540 --> 00:39:13,230
with hatred growing stronger.

531
00:39:13,230 --> 00:39:15,930
You will become more and more powerful.

532
00:39:16,320 --> 00:39:17,370
Not enough.

533
00:39:17,800 --> 00:39:18,810
It's not enough.

534
00:39:19,890 --> 00:39:21,030
I don't care about

535
00:39:21,500 --> 00:39:22,720
humans or demons.

536
00:39:23,270 --> 00:39:25,590
I want this world to be in ruins.

537
00:39:25,800 --> 00:39:27,270
Hatred and despair

538
00:39:27,640 --> 00:39:29,740
are the sources of my power.

539
00:39:38,940 --> 00:39:41,740
With love fading and hatred growing in this world,

540
00:39:42,740 --> 00:39:44,940
I will definitely return to the circle.

541
00:39:47,790 --> 00:39:48,950
Darkness

542
00:39:49,070 --> 00:39:51,240
will consume everything!
