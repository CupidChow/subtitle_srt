[Love in Pavilion]

2
00:01:46,350 --> 00:01:50,660
[Episode 15]

3
00:02:14,590 --> 00:02:15,520
Tell me.

4
00:02:15,890 --> 00:02:19,480
What exactly happened to you in Baiyu Village?

5
00:02:25,150 --> 00:02:28,840
Miss Cuiyu, why did you go to Baiyu Village?

6
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:33,410
I was looking for my disciple, Xiaotan.

7
00:02:34,579 --> 00:02:38,030
I came to Sky City, where humans and demons coexist peacefully

8
00:02:38,030 --> 00:02:39,790
to gather information,

9
00:02:40,030 --> 00:02:41,960
so I passed through Baiyu Village.

10
00:02:42,630 --> 00:02:44,520
On the mountain in Baiyu Village,

11
00:02:45,910 --> 00:02:48,510
I encountered Sun Yuanji, who had a broken leg.

12
00:02:49,060 --> 00:02:50,560
I helped him

13
00:02:50,870 --> 00:02:52,200
and stayed at his house.

14
00:02:52,700 --> 00:02:54,630
But they tried to harm me.

15
00:03:27,110 --> 00:03:30,020
A leech demon with such strong healing abilities.

16
00:03:30,220 --> 00:03:31,890
If we send her to Ma,

17
00:03:32,070 --> 00:03:34,440
he'll surely give us a good price.

18
00:03:36,150 --> 00:03:38,410
Speaking of which, what's the use of sending this demon

19
00:03:38,410 --> 00:03:39,670
to the Golden Dawn Inn?

20
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:42,520
If you want to live long,

21
00:03:43,030 --> 00:03:44,240
don't ask

22
00:03:45,630 --> 00:03:46,760
what you shouldn't.

23
00:03:56,900 --> 00:03:58,090
Bro,

24
00:03:58,550 --> 00:04:00,420
this leech demon is so beautiful.

25
00:04:10,900 --> 00:04:13,010
Don't come any closer, don't come any closer.

26
00:04:13,010 --> 00:04:14,120
Don't come any closer.

27
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:14,930
Don't come any closer!

28
00:04:14,930 --> 00:04:16,149
Don't come any closer!

29
00:04:16,149 --> 00:04:17,459
Don't come any closer.

30
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:19,380
Don't come any closer.

31
00:04:19,750 --> 00:04:21,010
Don't come any closer.

32
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:34,950
Continue.

33
00:04:45,870 --> 00:04:48,159
So, where did those three bastards from the Sun family

34
00:04:48,159 --> 00:04:49,390
take you?

35
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:52,260
They...

36
00:04:52,930 --> 00:04:56,310
They took me to the Golden Dawn Inn.

37
00:04:57,880 --> 00:05:00,010
I was knocked out by some kind of smoke.

38
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:03,130
I couldn't move my body,

39
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:06,720
but I was conscious.

40
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:11,580
They put me in a large vat.

41
00:05:11,830 --> 00:05:15,610
The liquid in the vat could submerge me completely.

42
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:17,120
That liquid...

43
00:05:18,070 --> 00:05:19,070
It was very hot.

44
00:05:20,310 --> 00:05:21,870
As hot as fire.

45
00:05:24,510 --> 00:05:25,990
I could feel

46
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:30,390
that scalding liquid enveloping my demon core,

47
00:05:30,810 --> 00:05:32,560
absorbing my demonic energy.

48
00:05:33,610 --> 00:05:34,970
Inside my body,

49
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:38,690
another thing similar to a demon core formed.

50
00:05:39,570 --> 00:05:40,870
It was very hot,

51
00:05:41,370 --> 00:05:42,510
very volatile.

52
00:05:43,060 --> 00:05:43,850
Don't!

53
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:45,800
Don't what?

54
00:05:47,050 --> 00:05:49,230
Don't come closer! I don't want to die!

55
00:05:49,270 --> 00:05:50,240
I want to live!

56
00:05:51,230 --> 00:05:52,690
Live for what?

57
00:05:52,710 --> 00:05:53,600
Revenge.

58
00:05:54,220 --> 00:05:56,700
To kill those ungrateful things.

59
00:06:01,430 --> 00:06:03,360
That's when I appeared.

60
00:06:04,700 --> 00:06:07,510
I escaped from there with Blue Eyes.

61
00:06:08,430 --> 00:06:09,920
I only remember one thing.

62
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:12,040
Blue Eyes survived

63
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:13,750
just to

64
00:06:13,750 --> 00:06:16,190
kill those ungrateful Sun family members.

65
00:06:18,070 --> 00:06:19,200
But she was too weak.

66
00:06:21,390 --> 00:06:22,920
I had just killed Sun Yuanli

67
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:25,500
when Blue Eyes woke up.

68
00:06:26,270 --> 00:06:27,000
She...

69
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:30,430
She ran away as if she had done something wrong.

70
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:47,040
Yes,

71
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:50,270
I killed him.

72
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:54,190
I killed the village chief's son.

73
00:06:56,159 --> 00:06:57,800
But I don't regret it at all.

74
00:06:58,700 --> 00:06:59,950
Miss Cuiyu

75
00:07:00,870 --> 00:07:02,930
must have been at the Golden Dawn Inn,

76
00:07:03,190 --> 00:07:04,850
on the brink of life and death,

77
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:07,180
when another her was born.

78
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:09,800
So the key to everything

79
00:07:10,190 --> 00:07:12,190
must be at the Golden Dawn Inn.

80
00:07:13,270 --> 00:07:14,810
Take a look.

81
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:24,750
Yitan.

82
00:07:24,770 --> 00:07:25,570
Look.

83
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:28,100
The mark of the Mask Group.

84
00:07:47,610 --> 00:07:49,659
One o'clock, Lizi Hill.

85
00:07:51,710 --> 00:07:52,630
It's Hongye.

86
00:07:55,670 --> 00:07:56,950
One o'clock has already passed.

87
00:07:56,950 --> 00:07:57,880
Where's Hongye?

88
00:08:00,420 --> 00:08:01,210
Zui.

89
00:08:02,790 --> 00:08:04,120
There's a demonic aura.

90
00:08:09,250 --> 00:08:11,050
I'm not here to fight.

91
00:08:11,230 --> 00:08:13,030
Wangquan Hongye told me

92
00:08:13,420 --> 00:08:14,930
that if I showed you this,

93
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:16,720
you would trust me.

94
00:08:31,180 --> 00:08:34,679
So the key to everything is at the Golden Dawn Inn.

95
00:08:35,690 --> 00:08:37,220
Jiuhuo is using demon lives

96
00:08:37,250 --> 00:08:39,929
to cultivate Golden Dawn fragments at the inn.

97
00:08:39,980 --> 00:08:42,179
Cuiyu Mingluan escaped from there too.

98
00:08:42,659 --> 00:08:44,860
She is the last piece of the Golden Dawn.

99
00:08:46,270 --> 00:08:48,630
That's why Jiuhuo must find her.

100
00:08:49,900 --> 00:08:51,310
So what's your plan?

101
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:55,090
Lord Jiuhuo not only has immense demonic energy,

102
00:08:55,450 --> 00:08:57,850
but he's also the god of the entire Sky City.

103
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:00,200
These few small external allies of yours

104
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:01,440
can't take him down.

105
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:05,030
Have Yang Yitan bring explosive talismans.

106
00:09:05,030 --> 00:09:06,240
Tomorrow, make the exchange

107
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:08,170
with Jiuhuo at the Golden Dawn Inn.

108
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:10,170
I not only want to take you away,

109
00:09:11,530 --> 00:09:12,550
but I also want to let

110
00:09:12,550 --> 00:09:14,360
all humans and demons in Sky City

111
00:09:15,390 --> 00:09:17,850
to know the true face of the fake god, Jiuhuo.

112
00:09:20,390 --> 00:09:22,880
Even if Lord Jiuhuo goes alone,

113
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:25,580
it's still impossible to escape unscathed.

114
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:27,740
It's possible.

115
00:09:28,470 --> 00:09:30,200
We have someone who can make him

116
00:09:31,270 --> 00:09:32,600
hesitate to act.

117
00:09:33,150 --> 00:09:34,080
And that's you.

118
00:09:40,390 --> 00:09:41,440
Left Guardian,

119
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:43,320
Lord Jiuhuo wants you to take this prisoner

120
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:45,050
to meet him at the Rebirth Pool.

121
00:09:52,730 --> 00:09:54,390
Even if the Golden Dawn is missing just a small piece,

122
00:09:54,390 --> 00:09:55,930
it's not complete

123
00:09:56,060 --> 00:09:57,800
and can't exert its power.

124
00:09:58,790 --> 00:09:59,840
I understand.

125
00:09:59,870 --> 00:10:02,490
Time is running out for the Seven-Star Alignment.

126
00:10:02,490 --> 00:10:03,750
If we miss this chance,

127
00:10:03,750 --> 00:10:06,130
the next time the barrier weakens

128
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:09,200
will be in 100 years.

129
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:15,600
Lord Jiuhuo.

130
00:10:16,670 --> 00:10:18,670
The three-day deadline has passed.

131
00:10:19,710 --> 00:10:20,970
Where are your people?

132
00:10:37,150 --> 00:10:39,360
It seems your life isn't that important

133
00:10:39,390 --> 00:10:41,080
to those little insects.

134
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:53,050
Right Guardian.

135
00:10:59,240 --> 00:11:00,270
Lord Jiuhuo,

136
00:11:00,490 --> 00:11:02,150
Yang Yitan has sent a message,

137
00:11:02,270 --> 00:11:05,530
offering to exchange Cuiyu Mingluan for Wangquan Hongye.

138
00:11:05,530 --> 00:11:07,530
The location is the Golden Dawn Inn.

139
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:13,440
I am willing to personally escort Wangquan Hongye

140
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:14,510
for the exchange.

141
00:11:14,810 --> 00:11:15,940
You don't need to go.

142
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:18,120
Ye Yuan.

143
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:19,150
Yes.

144
00:11:19,550 --> 00:11:21,330
Bring Wangquan Hongye.

145
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:23,940
I will go with you to the Golden Dawn Inn.

146
00:11:24,250 --> 00:11:25,510
-Lord Jiuhuo.
-Yes.

147
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,360
The plan was my suggestion.

148
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:28,270
Guards!

149
00:11:28,270 --> 00:11:28,750
My Lord.

150
00:11:28,750 --> 00:11:31,080
Escort the Left Guardian back to her room.

151
00:11:31,240 --> 00:11:33,390
She is not allowed to step out of the room.

152
00:11:33,390 --> 00:11:34,550
If she disobeys,

153
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:36,510
inform me immediately.

154
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:42,360
Yes, sir.

155
00:12:00,210 --> 00:12:03,640
[Golden Dawn Inn]

156
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:31,120
The Cuiyu Mingluan you want is in our hands.

157
00:12:31,130 --> 00:12:32,530
Let's make the exchange.

158
00:12:33,080 --> 00:12:33,910
Is it her?

159
00:12:33,910 --> 00:12:35,480
This is the leech demon.

160
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:36,800
Inside her body

161
00:12:37,110 --> 00:12:38,200
is the last piece of the Golden Dawn fragment

162
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:40,360
that you want, My Lord.

163
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:43,880
What exactly is this Golden Dawn?

164
00:12:44,100 --> 00:12:46,480
What do you use it for?

165
00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:48,670
You want to know?

166
00:12:50,110 --> 00:12:52,200
Then I shall tell you today.

167
00:12:55,830 --> 00:12:57,360
A thousand years ago,

168
00:12:58,200 --> 00:13:00,770
a hawkish demon king appeared in our clan.

169
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:03,070
He had a magical artifact tied to his life force,

170
00:13:03,070 --> 00:13:05,370
forged from his bone marrow and blood,

171
00:13:05,470 --> 00:13:07,140
connected to his very soul.

172
00:13:07,390 --> 00:13:09,610
This artifact shimmered with light,

173
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:11,510
like the gold-colored dawn,

174
00:13:12,490 --> 00:13:15,520
hence it was named Golden Dawn.

175
00:13:20,590 --> 00:13:22,000
Let me ask you a question.

176
00:13:22,210 --> 00:13:23,410
Do you hate me?

177
00:13:24,150 --> 00:13:25,510
O-Of course not.

178
00:13:28,150 --> 00:13:31,750
But why do I smell something delicious?

179
00:13:43,080 --> 00:13:44,320
Jiuhuo.

180
00:13:44,910 --> 00:13:47,120
You forced me to do all this.

181
00:13:50,270 --> 00:13:51,970
If Black Fox can

182
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:53,270
feed on hatred,

183
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,670
I should be able to as well.

184
00:14:08,730 --> 00:14:10,930
Forsaking emotions, pursuing hatred;

185
00:14:11,030 --> 00:14:14,330
chasing the power that can make oneself stronger.

186
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:16,850
So that's what it means.

187
00:14:28,890 --> 00:14:30,720
The demon king was belligerent all his life

188
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:33,080
and formed an irreconcilable feud with the Dragon Clan.

189
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:35,430
In the end, he was surrounded by many dragons,

190
00:14:35,430 --> 00:14:37,710
and died on the banks of the Si River.

191
00:14:38,490 --> 00:14:41,590
His body sank into the Si River,

192
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:44,440
while the shattered Golden Dawn

193
00:14:44,440 --> 00:14:46,200
flew back to our capital

194
00:14:47,150 --> 00:14:49,150
and slumbered in the Rebirth Pool.

195
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:51,200
This golden water

196
00:14:51,790 --> 00:14:54,150
is the condensed water from the Si River,

197
00:14:55,670 --> 00:14:56,960
flowing with

198
00:14:57,440 --> 00:15:01,440
the blood and demonic energy of our clan's strongest demon king.

199
00:15:02,110 --> 00:15:04,310
So you lured great demons to Sky City

200
00:15:05,950 --> 00:15:07,950
and immersed them in this large vat,

201
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:11,630
intending to use the power of their demon cores

202
00:15:11,630 --> 00:15:13,560
to reconstitute the golden water,

203
00:15:13,670 --> 00:15:17,130
and then form fragments of Golden Dawn to repair the artifact?

204
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:18,320
Indeed.

205
00:15:19,150 --> 00:15:20,780
Gathering the power of many demon cores,

206
00:15:20,780 --> 00:15:22,830
the repaired Golden Dawn artifact

207
00:15:23,150 --> 00:15:24,810
will be stronger than before.

208
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,880
You are indeed clever.

209
00:15:34,840 --> 00:15:38,510
Do you know what happens to those

210
00:15:39,080 --> 00:15:40,700
who learn my secrets?

211
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:41,960
They die.

212
00:15:44,280 --> 00:15:46,340
Cuiyu Mingluan is still in our hands.

213
00:15:46,790 --> 00:15:48,200
What makes you think

214
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:50,790
I want to exchange hostages with you?

215
00:15:53,790 --> 00:15:55,240
What makes you think I want

216
00:15:55,240 --> 00:15:56,920
a living leech demon?

217
00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:19,960
When was the seal broken?

218
00:16:20,030 --> 00:16:21,960
After listening to your rambling.

219
00:16:39,030 --> 00:16:40,280
Lord Jiuhuo.

220
00:16:40,690 --> 00:16:43,040
Didn't I tell you to stay in Sky City

221
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:44,580
and not to leave?

222
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:46,240
Where are the demon guards?

223
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:47,740
I just wanted to know

224
00:16:48,080 --> 00:16:49,260
why you forbade me

225
00:16:49,390 --> 00:16:51,320
from coming to the Golden Dawn Inn.

226
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:52,200
What secrets are here

227
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:53,800
that I'm not allowed to know?

228
00:16:54,510 --> 00:16:55,510
Foolish.

229
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:57,380
Let them come over,

230
00:16:58,510 --> 00:16:59,700
or I'll kill her.

231
00:16:59,840 --> 00:17:00,910
Kill her?

232
00:17:02,390 --> 00:17:03,580
Can you bear to do it?

233
00:17:03,750 --> 00:17:05,079
I'm different from you.

234
00:17:05,440 --> 00:17:07,569
I can do anything for the greater good.

235
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:09,920
I can die with her,

236
00:17:10,119 --> 00:17:11,810
but I will never let her

237
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:14,260
commit such a grave mistake with you.

238
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:20,640
Then think about...

239
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:24,700
Jia Lan.

240
00:18:24,550 --> 00:18:25,010
Hongye.

241
00:18:35,750 --> 00:18:38,720
Quzhuo's explosive talisman is really powerful.

242
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:41,110
The cellar of the Golden Dawn Inn has been destroyed.

243
00:18:41,110 --> 00:18:44,370
I'm afraid Jiuhuo's secret can no longer be hidden.

244
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:53,270
Do you think Huaizhu has remembered everything?

245
00:19:05,010 --> 00:19:06,360
Where are you going?

246
00:19:07,830 --> 00:19:09,090
Sky-breaking Temple.

247
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:12,350
Also, my Third Brother and Fourth Brother

248
00:19:12,350 --> 00:19:14,070
are experts in magical artifacts and talismans.

249
00:19:14,070 --> 00:19:15,670
They must have a way to remove

250
00:19:15,750 --> 00:19:18,010
or suppress the demonic aura inside you.

251
00:19:20,850 --> 00:19:24,130
Dragon blood or dragon bone can counter Jiuhuo.

252
00:19:26,150 --> 00:19:29,680
This is the last piece of information I've been hiding from you.

253
00:19:32,350 --> 00:19:33,610
If you take me with you,

254
00:19:33,750 --> 00:19:36,130
Jiuhuo will relentlessly pursue you.

255
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:37,510
Only if I go back

256
00:19:37,910 --> 00:19:39,380
will he let his guard down.

257
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:40,790
Huaizhu,

258
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:47,910
I will wait for you in Sky City

259
00:19:48,030 --> 00:19:49,960
to return with the dragon blood.

260
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:06,590
Then let's set out now.

261
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:08,520
What about Huaizhu?

262
00:20:09,560 --> 00:20:12,200
The most important thing now is to find the dragon blood

263
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:13,920
and gather strength to deal with Jiuhuo.

264
00:20:13,920 --> 00:20:15,550
As long as Jiuhuo can't break through the Boundary,

265
00:20:15,550 --> 00:20:16,750
Huaizhu will be safe.

266
00:20:19,320 --> 00:20:20,340
I'll help too.

267
00:20:24,830 --> 00:20:25,590
Yitan,

268
00:20:26,020 --> 00:20:26,950
Young Master Mu,

269
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:29,000
please come with me for a moment.

270
00:20:39,160 --> 00:20:41,820
If you insist on not taking me on this adventure,

271
00:20:41,880 --> 00:20:43,810
there's something I must tell you.

272
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:45,680
Go ahead.

273
00:20:48,790 --> 00:20:51,250
My mother and I used to live in the mountains.

274
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:53,000
After my mother passed away,

275
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:54,550
I lived well on my own.

276
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:56,750
The reason I came to Sky City

277
00:20:58,540 --> 00:21:00,160
was because I had a dream.

278
00:21:02,810 --> 00:21:04,740
You are the second person in the Yang family besides me

279
00:21:04,740 --> 00:21:06,440
who can activate the Clairvoyance Eye.

280
00:21:06,440 --> 00:21:07,760
And the dreams of Clairvoyance Eye

281
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:09,330
all show the true future.

282
00:21:09,830 --> 00:21:11,230
What did you dream about?

283
00:21:19,510 --> 00:21:20,830
I dreamed of a person

284
00:21:22,110 --> 00:21:24,970
dying from gouging out their own Clairvoyance Eye.

285
00:21:26,310 --> 00:21:27,370
And that person...

286
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:29,350
That person

287
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:31,680
was me,

288
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:33,480
wasn't it?

289
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:36,350
My Clairvoyance is not stable.

290
00:21:36,350 --> 00:21:37,750
It might not be accurate.

291
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,200
I was just worried

292
00:21:39,510 --> 00:21:41,440
and felt that person was familiar.

293
00:21:41,640 --> 00:21:44,100
That's why I came to Sky City to investigate.

294
00:21:47,670 --> 00:21:50,110
It's alright. I'll be as careful as I can

295
00:21:50,310 --> 00:21:52,510
to prevent your dream from coming true.

296
00:21:53,880 --> 00:21:56,400
Are you really not planning to take me with you?

297
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:58,530
I might really be able to help somehow.

298
00:21:59,270 --> 00:22:01,600
Your mother left the Yang family back then

299
00:22:02,110 --> 00:22:03,960
with the purpose of severing ties with

300
00:22:03,960 --> 00:22:05,570
the Yiqi Alliance and us.

301
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:08,790
Your surname is Mu, not Yang.

302
00:22:09,640 --> 00:22:11,900
You should fulfill your parents' wishes

303
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:13,570
to be an ordinary person

304
00:22:14,260 --> 00:22:16,950
and live a long and peaceful life.

305
00:22:25,960 --> 00:22:26,510
Mu Mie,

306
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,000
don't take risks.

307
00:22:29,180 --> 00:22:31,040
Don't get involved in conflicts.

308
00:22:31,050 --> 00:22:32,490
Go travel and sightsee,

309
00:22:32,520 --> 00:22:33,920
see the sky and the earth,

310
00:22:33,940 --> 00:22:34,920
and look at...

311
00:22:36,970 --> 00:22:37,930
real snow.

312
00:22:48,410 --> 00:22:49,170
Go.

313
00:23:06,810 --> 00:23:08,540
Future matters, future plans.

314
00:23:09,050 --> 00:23:10,780
I've always been open-minded.

315
00:23:18,030 --> 00:23:18,830
Let's go.

316
00:23:26,350 --> 00:23:27,610
You escaped back here?

317
00:23:29,070 --> 00:23:29,720
Yes.

318
00:23:30,830 --> 00:23:34,000
If you betrayed us, why did you come back?

319
00:23:35,550 --> 00:23:36,790
I didn't betray you.

320
00:23:37,880 --> 00:23:39,270
You defied me.

321
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:41,440
As a result, you were taken hostage,

322
00:23:41,620 --> 00:23:44,680
allowing those little insects to escape unscathed.

323
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:46,830
And you still deny it?

324
00:23:54,680 --> 00:23:56,030
You learned this trick

325
00:23:56,050 --> 00:23:59,450
of self-inflicted injury from Wangquan Hongye, didn't you?

326
00:23:59,770 --> 00:24:01,720
I just can't accept it.

327
00:24:01,830 --> 00:24:03,070
Can't accept it?

328
00:24:04,620 --> 00:24:07,200
I can't accept living in lies.

329
00:24:08,200 --> 00:24:09,350
I want to know

330
00:24:09,850 --> 00:24:12,450
what I really mean to you.

331
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:18,930
Why did you abandon me when Wangquan Hongye

332
00:24:20,190 --> 00:24:21,710
mentioned Jia Lan

333
00:24:22,560 --> 00:24:23,980
and let them take me away?

334
00:24:42,360 --> 00:24:45,060
My Lord, why are you healing this traitor?

335
00:24:53,530 --> 00:24:55,400
I have kept things from you

336
00:24:56,310 --> 00:24:58,280
out of concern for you.

337
00:24:59,130 --> 00:25:00,550
You must understand.

338
00:25:00,570 --> 00:25:03,090
I didn't want you to know too much

339
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:04,920
because to me,

340
00:25:06,570 --> 00:25:08,150
you are invaluable.

341
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:10,150
Is that so?

342
00:25:12,360 --> 00:25:13,840
Since you want to know,

343
00:25:14,510 --> 00:25:16,640
I will no longer keep secrets from you.

344
00:25:17,550 --> 00:25:18,400
Tomorrow,

345
00:25:19,530 --> 00:25:22,000
I will tell you everything.

346
00:25:27,960 --> 00:25:28,680
Ye Yuan.

347
00:25:29,570 --> 00:25:30,250
Yes.

348
00:25:52,050 --> 00:25:53,870
This Sky-breaking Temple was already in ruins.

349
00:25:53,870 --> 00:25:55,200
Twenty years have passed.

350
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:56,530
It hasn't changed much.

351
00:25:57,800 --> 00:25:59,400
Have you notified everyone?

352
00:25:59,960 --> 00:26:02,390
I sent letters to our brothers explaining the situation,

353
00:26:02,390 --> 00:26:04,770
asking them to wait for us at the Sky-breaking Temple.

354
00:26:04,770 --> 00:26:06,370
But so far, only the Li family

355
00:26:06,830 --> 00:26:07,690
has responded.

356
00:26:11,270 --> 00:26:13,000
Let's go inside and take a look.

357
00:26:27,370 --> 00:26:29,170
This place is still the same.

358
00:26:29,790 --> 00:26:31,400
I wonder if after 20 years,

359
00:26:31,400 --> 00:26:34,040
Li Quzhuo has stopped being such a chatterbox.

360
00:27:24,050 --> 00:27:25,320
Hongye.

361
00:27:26,900 --> 00:27:28,070
Quzhuo?

362
00:27:31,660 --> 00:27:32,630
Yitan.

363
00:27:33,810 --> 00:27:34,570
Qinlan.

364
00:27:36,440 --> 00:27:37,720
I'm not dreaming.

365
00:27:38,920 --> 00:27:39,590
How did you

366
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:43,580
come to 20 years in the future?

367
00:27:47,270 --> 00:27:48,790
I'm not dreaming.

368
00:27:58,240 --> 00:28:00,830
Quzhuo, your leg...

369
00:28:04,850 --> 00:28:06,790
Why has it become like this?

370
00:28:07,790 --> 00:28:08,990
Where are the others?

371
00:28:21,720 --> 00:28:22,510
Dead.

372
00:28:27,310 --> 00:28:28,720
They're all dead.

373
00:28:31,710 --> 00:28:35,310
The Mask Group went outside the Boundary to battle the Black Fox.

374
00:28:37,390 --> 00:28:39,720
I was the only one who survived.

375
00:28:45,650 --> 00:28:48,960
