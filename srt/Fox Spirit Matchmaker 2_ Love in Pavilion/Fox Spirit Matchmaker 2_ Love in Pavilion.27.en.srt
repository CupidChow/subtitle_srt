00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:45,550
to help you sleep.

191
00:12:45,550 --> 00:12:46,440
No.

192
00:12:49,330 --> 00:12:52,940
I'm now your lifesaver, in a way.

193
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:56,300
How do you want to repay me?

194
00:12:57,080 --> 00:12:59,210
Any kind of repayment you want is fine.

195
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:06,360
Zhang Zheng.

196
00:13:06,970 --> 00:13:07,890
Let me tell you.

197
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:10,440
I like you.

198
00:13:11,210 --> 00:13:13,310
I don't need any repayment from you.

199
00:13:14,740 --> 00:13:16,940
You're powerful and strong in my heart.

200
00:13:18,610 --> 00:13:20,350
You don't owe anyone anything.

201
00:13:20,670 --> 00:13:22,630
You've already done very well.

202
00:13:24,150 --> 00:13:25,210
Do you understand?

203
00:13:34,090 --> 00:13:35,660
Do you understand me or not?

204
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,860
I won't be like this anymore.

205
00:13:53,870 --> 00:13:54,720
Don't worry.

206
00:13:56,390 --> 00:13:58,650
I'm clinging onto you for this lifetime.

207
00:13:59,280 --> 00:14:01,390
Even if you get annoyed with me in the future,

208
00:14:01,390 --> 00:14:02,450
or grow tired of me,

209
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:06,540
I'll always be clinging to you.

210
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:25,120
Yuan,

211
00:14:26,630 --> 00:14:28,290
for this lifetime and beyond,

212
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:34,060
you're the only one for me.

213
00:14:36,890 --> 00:14:38,260
Do you mean it?

214
00:14:39,030 --> 00:14:39,840
Yes.

215
00:14:41,590 --> 00:14:43,150
Give me a kiss.

216
00:14:43,510 --> 00:14:44,770

238
00:16:04,890 --> 00:16:06,080
Bumu has become

239
00:16:06,080 --> 00:16:07,910
the new ruler of the Beast Kingdom.

240
00:16:07,910 --> 00:16:10,490
He invited us to go to the dungeon with him tomorrow.

241
00:16:10,490 --> 00:16:11,960
That's truly good news.

242
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:19,170
Oh, right.

243
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:22,440
Quzhuo taught me something.

244
00:16:22,550 --> 00:16:24,890
Quzhuo? Taught you?

245
00:16:25,030 --> 00:16:25,840
He said...

246
00:16:27,750 --> 00:16:28,550
Wait a moment.

247
00:16:30,440 --> 00:16:32,170
There seems to be something...

248
00:16:32,500 --> 00:16:34,410
Is it a small bug or a loose thread?

249
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:36,520
Let me take a look for you.

250
00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:03,750
Is this what Quzhuo taught you?

251
00:17:07,619 --> 00:17:08,750
Then I'll go ask him.

252
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:11,880
If you go ask him now,

253
00:17:12,550 --> 00:17:14,010
he'll certainly admit it.

254
00:17:35,650 --> 00:17:36,990
You failed.

255
00:17:39,580 --> 00:17:41,890
Jiuhuo, I can't believe you failed.

256
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:52,640
I admit I was careless this time.

257
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:53,680
Careless?

258
00:17:54,510 --> 00:17:56,810
They were supposed to have only one fate,

259
00:17:56,840 --> 00:17:59,130
which was to be crushed under my feet.

260
00:17:59,390 --> 00:18:01,260
But because of your negligence,

261
00:18:01,550 --> 00:18:04,510
not only did Dongfang Huaizhu obtain the Twilight Mist Flower,

262
00:18:04,510 --> 00:18:06,160
but Wangquan Hongye also gained

263
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:08,270
the power to destroy me beyond the Boundary.

264
00:18:08,270 --> 00:18:11,400
If you were still the powerful Lord Jiuhuo you once were,

265
00:18:11,590 --> 00:18:13,510
none of this would have happened.

266
00:18:13,790 --> 00:18:16,070
You would have annihilated them in one fell swoop,

267
00:18:16,070 --> 00:18:17,920
instead of hiding here in Sky City,

268
00:18:17,920 --> 00:18:19,400
helpless against them.

269
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,930
The solar eclipse is approaching.

270
00:18:24,790 --> 00:18:26,340
I will find a way

271
00:18:26,750 --> 00:18:28,640
to break the connection between the Black Grief Tree

272
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:30,870
and the Grief Tree,

273
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:35,000
so you can obtain the power of the Grief Tree within the Boundary.

274
00:18:35,510 --> 00:18:36,550
But...

275
00:18:38,830 --> 00:18:41,400
But you are already very weak.

276
00:18:41,790 --> 00:18:44,920
This action will consume a great deal of demonic energy.

277
00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:46,680
As long as you can return,

278
00:18:48,310 --> 00:18:49,880
I will spare no effort.

279
00:18:52,750 --> 00:18:53,960
I'm sorry.

280
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,550
Forgive me for losing my temper with you earlier.

281
00:18:57,550 --> 00:18:59,930
I can't bear to see you so weak.

282
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,210
Love makes one panic.

283
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:03,170
After all...

284
00:19:04,540 --> 00:19:07,600
After all, you are the Lord Jiuhuo I care about the most.

285
00:19:08,260 --> 00:19:09,230
Tell me,

286
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,440
are you still waiting for me?

287
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:13,170
Don't be silly.

288
00:19:15,640 --> 00:19:16,680
I promise you.

289
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:20,270
I will definitely bring you back.

290
00:19:22,030 --> 00:19:22,880
Okay.

291
00:19:23,550 --> 00:19:24,640
I believe you.

292
00:19:25,720 --> 00:19:26,790
Lord Jiuhuo,

293
00:19:27,640 --> 00:19:28,510
remember,

294
00:19:29,550 --> 00:19:31,210
we can't afford to lose again.

295
00:20:00,610 --> 00:20:02,720
After all these years at Mount Xuankong,

296
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:04,570
is this all you've learned?

297
00:20:04,990 --> 00:20:06,050
Just you wait.

298
00:20:37,530 --> 00:20:38,940
You've lost again.

299
00:20:42,310 --> 00:20:43,030
I...

300
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:09,680
Jia Lan.

301
00:21:12,110 --> 00:21:13,960
You're trying to manipulate me?

302
00:21:14,030 --> 00:21:14,750
I'm not.

303
00:21:15,680 --> 00:21:17,520
Lord Jiuhuo, you're so powerful.

304
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:18,750
I wouldn't dare to.

305
00:21:21,570 --> 00:21:23,770
But you've really improved this time.

306
00:21:23,970 --> 00:21:25,900
I have a gift for you.

307
00:21:27,030 --> 00:21:27,880
What gift?

308
00:21:31,310 --> 00:21:32,310
A little fox!

309
00:21:40,030 --> 00:21:41,210
Lord Jiuhuo,

310
00:21:41,720 --> 00:21:43,510
I've also prepared a gift for you.

311
00:21:43,510 --> 00:21:44,540

Or perhaps...

349
00:23:30,920 --> 00:23:33,680
Lord Jiuhuo, what's wrong?

350
00:23:33,830 --> 00:23:36,090
The Dragon Clan and our Netherworld Clan

351
00:23:36,160 --> 00:23:37,510
are mortal enemies.

352
00:23:37,680 --> 00:23:39,720
They've been trespassing frequently lately.

353
00:23:39,720 --> 00:23:41,910
I went to raid their lair.

354
00:23:43,270 --> 00:23:44,480
You went alone

355
00:23:44,920 --> 00:23:46,960
to raid the Dragon Clan's lair?

356
00:23:47,660 --> 00:23:49,440
The True Dragon Clan has been destroyed.

357
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:52,430
Unfortunately, the Dragon King escaped.

00:23:53,590 --> 00:23:55,670
My Lord, My Lord!

359
00:23:59,640 --> 00:24:00,750

Alright.

His demon core is shattered.

363
00:24:22,550 --> 00:24:26,080
Or maybe it started when she, who had always been cold-blooded,

364
00:24:26,680 --> 00:24:29,820
guarded me for three days and nights.

365

00:27:11,160 --> 00:27:12,240
Our Jia Lan,

412
00:27:12,790 --> 00:27:13,920
you've worked hard.

413
00:27:15,270 --> 00:27:16,000
My Lord,

414
00:27:16,350 --> 00:27:18,110
then can I have a reward?

415
00:27:19,070 --> 00:27:19,960
Certainly.

416
00:27:26,590 --> 00:27:28,030
It's been a long time since you've

417
00:27:28,030 --> 00:27:30,110
combed my hair.

418
00:27:39,590 --> 00:27:41,850
Why did you slay the dragon without permission?

419
00:27:41,850 --> 00:27:43,340
I like the strong.

420
00:27:44,110 --> 00:27:46,270
Anyone who stands in your way

421
00:27:46,570 --> 00:27:47,510
must die.

422
00:27:48,290 --> 00:27:51,170
Then if one day I'm no longer strong,

423
00:27:52,920 --> 00:27:55,350
will you treat me like a butterfly

424
00:27:56,550 --> 00:27:58,880
and let me die at my most beautiful moment?

425
00:28:08,440 --> 00:28:10,270
You're my Lord Jiuhuo.

426
00:28:11,400 --> 00:28:13,160
How can you die?

427
00:28:20,830 --> 00:28:23,430
You've slain the last true dragon in the world.

428
00:28:24,030 --> 00:28:26,490
Neither humans nor demons will forgive you.

429
00:28:27,330 --> 00:28:28,620
So what?

430
00:28:30,550 --> 00:28:31,310
Indeed.

431
00:28:32,730 --> 00:28:34,040
So what?

432
00:28:35,590 --> 00:28:37,920
If anyone dares to question or oppose you,

433
00:28:39,030 --> 00:28:40,680
we'll just kill them.

434
00:28:46,600 --> 00:28:49,170
It wasn't actually at any particular moment.

435
00:28:49,670 --> 00:28:51,730
When I discovered there was

436
00:28:51,920 --> 00:28:54,720
another being as dangerous as myself in this world

437
00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:57,160
and she entered my world,

438
00:28:57,590 --> 00:28:58,440
we had

439
00:28:59,220 --> 00:29:01,370
already become inseparable.

440
00:29:01,720 --> 00:29:03,550
Even if I'm shattered to pieces,

441
00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:07,790
I will definitely fulfill my promise.

442
00:29:09,270 --> 00:29:11,070
I will also protect your safety.

443
00:29:12,250 --> 00:29:13,390
When you return,

444
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:16,000
I will roam freely with you.

445
00:29:17,750 --> 00:29:18,610
How about that?

446
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:34,970
Prince, congratulations on becoming the ruler.

447
00:29:40,920 --> 00:29:41,860
I know.

448
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:45,880
The Yiqi Alliance shouldn't interfere in the affairs of the Beast Kingdom.

449
00:29:45,880 --> 00:29:48,250
But Bumu, you understand the demon race.

450
00:29:48,680 --> 00:29:50,540
You should understand how I feel.

451
00:29:51,070 --> 00:29:53,720
The demons in the Beast Kingdom are living in misery.

452
00:29:53,720 --> 00:29:56,270
I hope they can have freedom one day.

453
00:29:56,880 --> 00:29:58,680
And with you becoming the ruler,

454
00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:01,590
perhaps that day will truly come.

455
00:30:08,590 --> 00:30:10,620
I have no intentions for the Beast Kingdom.

456
00:30:10,620 --> 00:30:11,880
Entering this secret chamber,

457
00:30:11,880 --> 00:30:12,920
I absolutely won't do

458
00:30:12,920 --> 00:30:15,120
anything harmful to the Beast Kingdom.

459
00:30:15,580 --> 00:30:18,770
I simply want to know the origin of the Black Fox.

460
00:30:29,720 --> 00:30:30,750
I trust you.

461
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:33,400
The ruler's royal seal is

462
00:30:33,510 --> 00:30:35,680
the only key open this secret chamber.

463
00:30:52,160 --> 00:30:52,960
Follow me.

464
00:30:59,550 --> 00:31:02,810
Only the ruler can enter this secret chamber.

465
00:31:03,240 --> 00:31:04,110
Look,

466
00:31:04,510 --> 00:31:05,880
the inscriptions on these walls

467
00:31:05,880 --> 00:31:08,140
record the history of the Beast Kingdom.

468
00:31:08,680 --> 00:31:09,790
This includes...

469
00:31:09,790 --> 00:31:12,450
The origin of the demon-controlling talisman.

470
00:31:14,200 --> 00:31:17,790
Could the people in this painting be Jia Lan and Jiuhuo?

471
00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:20,240
No wonder Jiuhuo

472
00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:23,370
was unwilling to recall everything that happened here.

473
00:31:24,030 --> 00:31:25,750
Jiuhuo obtained the dragon core

474
00:31:25,750 --> 00:31:27,350
and should have become invincible.

475
00:31:27,350 --> 00:31:28,410
But unexpectedly,

476
00:31:28,580 --> 00:31:29,680
the Northern Hill Elder

477
00:31:29,680 --> 00:31:31,910
dug up the remains of two dragons.

478
00:31:31,960 --> 00:31:34,350
He used resentment to turn it against Jiuhuo

479
00:31:34,350 --> 00:31:38,050
and trapped him in an extremely cruel way.

480
00:32:01,830 --> 00:32:03,050
Lord Jiuhuo.

481
00:32:07,590 --> 00:32:08,590
Jia Lan.

482
00:32:09,920 --> 00:32:11,070
I came too late.

483
00:32:11,830 --> 00:32:13,560
Who told you to come?

484
00:32:14,200 --> 00:32:15,310
Leave quickly.

485
00:32:21,030 --> 00:32:22,130
Don't worry.

486
00:32:24,590 --> 00:32:25,880
We'll leave together.

487
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:29,030
Jia Lan.

488
00:33:35,790 --> 00:33:39,440
What a devoted couple, sharing weal and woe.

489
00:33:40,110 --> 00:33:41,240
Unfortunately,

490
00:33:41,400 --> 00:33:43,550
neither of you will be leaving today.

491
00:33:44,790 --> 00:33:46,020
Who are you all?

492
00:33:46,200 --> 00:33:47,970
Allow me to introduce myself.

493
00:33:48,110 --> 00:33:50,220
[Old King of Beast Kingdom]

494
00:33:48,350 --> 00:33:50,280
I am the ruler of the Beast Kingdom.

495
00:33:51,030 --> 00:33:51,960
And this

496
00:33:52,200 --> 00:33:53,880
is the once-in-a-millennium

497
00:33:53,880 --> 00:33:55,940
prodigy in formation and rune magic,

498
00:33:56,160 --> 00:33:57,790
the Northern Hill Elder.

499
00:33:56,350 --> 00:33:57,990
[Northern Hill Elder]

500
00:34:01,130 --> 00:34:02,600
Do you like it here?

501
00:34:03,160 --> 00:34:04,030
This place

502
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:08,989
was specially prepared for an esteemed guest like you.

503
00:34:09,110 --> 00:34:10,560
So it's you.

504
00:34:11,480 --> 00:34:12,500
Jia Lan.

505
00:34:13,520 --> 00:34:15,780
How dare you treat Lord Jiuhuo like this?

506
00:34:16,330 --> 00:34:17,900
You'll all die today!

507
00:34:22,889 --> 00:34:23,639
Jia Lan!

508
00:34:49,320 --> 00:34:50,500
Lord Jiuhuo!

509
00:34:50,850 --> 00:34:51,690
Run.

510
00:34:53,960 --> 00:34:54,760
Run!

511
00:34:54,760 --> 00:34:55,820
Lord Jiuhuo!

512
00:34:56,630 --> 00:34:57,530
Jia Lan!

513
00:35:01,030 --> 00:35:01,840
Jia Lan!

514
00:35:04,360 --> 00:35:06,590
The ruler has brilliant strategy.

515
00:35:06,760 --> 00:35:07,930
To capture you,

516
00:35:08,150 --> 00:35:11,350
he buried thousands of demons alive in this pit,

517
00:35:11,510 --> 00:35:16,280
and used the blood of the demons you killed
to activate the formation.

518
00:35:18,900 --> 00:35:20,920
How about that, little fox?

519
00:35:21,150 --> 00:35:23,160
Even if you can slay dragons,

520
00:35:23,230 --> 00:35:27,220
you can't break free from this formation of 10,000 spirits.

521
00:36:02,150 --> 00:36:03,070
Jia Lan!

522
00:36:06,110 --> 00:36:06,920
Jia Lan.

523
00:36:09,840 --> 00:36:10,800
Jia Lan!

524
00:36:15,600 --> 00:36:17,660
I won't let you get away with this.

525
00:36:19,080 --> 00:36:20,870
Fire of All Spirits.

526
00:36:20,900 --> 00:36:24,510
Today, we offer this evil fox as a sacrifice

527
00:36:24,550 --> 00:36:27,870
in exchange for the power to control demons!

528
00:36:28,130 --> 00:36:29,100
Jia Lan.

529
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:30,840
Jia Lan!

530
00:36:36,760 --> 00:36:37,800
Jia Lan!

531
00:37:08,920 --> 00:37:09,880
No.

532
00:37:10,660 --> 00:37:11,580
No.

533
00:37:13,750 --> 00:37:14,830
Jia Lan!

534
00:37:33,710 --> 00:37:34,550
No.

535
00:37:43,090 --> 00:37:44,440
My Lord.

536
00:37:46,230 --> 00:37:47,110
No.

537
00:37:47,740 --> 00:37:48,570
No.

538
00:37:59,220 --> 00:38:00,860
My Lord.

539
00:38:31,100 --> 00:38:32,960
Congratulations, Your Majesty.

540
00:38:33,170 --> 00:38:34,920
We have obtained the demon blood.

541
00:38:34,920 --> 00:38:36,880
The demon-controlling talisman can now be created.

542
00:38:36,880 --> 00:38:41,370
You can now control demons and conquer the world.

543
00:38:41,670 --> 00:38:42,510
I

544
00:38:43,510 --> 00:38:45,710
killed this little demon girl
mentioned in the Tushan prophecy,

545
00:38:45,710 --> 00:38:48,240
who could destroy heaven and earth.

546
00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:50,800
We carried out heaven's will.

547
00:38:51,590 --> 00:38:53,720
The power to control demons within her

548
00:38:54,510 --> 00:38:58,860
shall be considered a reward from heaven for me.

549
00:38:59,440 --> 00:39:03,840
One by one, you all will die!

550
00:39:43,730 --> 00:39:45,150
Lord Jiuhuo,

551
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:47,030
please forgive me.

552
00:39:48,650 --> 00:39:53,130
I won't be able to return to Mount Xuankong with you this time.
