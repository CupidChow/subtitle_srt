1
00:01:10,945 --> 00:01:12,030
Are you okay?

2
00:01:13,490 --> 00:01:15,450
You're not nervous, are you?

3
00:01:20,330 --> 00:01:22,290
Are you worried...

4
00:01:23,374 --> 00:01:26,252
-that I'll ruin the presentation?
-Of course not.

5
00:01:28,213 --> 00:01:29,839
It'll be fine if I don't mess up.

6
00:01:30,673 --> 00:01:31,966
-Let's go.
-Okay.

7
00:01:36,304 --> 00:01:38,640
Every cell phone
has an AI virtual assistant

8
00:01:38,723 --> 00:01:40,016
built into it nowadays.

9
00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:42,602
They keep track of schedules
and find songs for you.

10
00:01:42,685 --> 00:01:44,729
Life would be inconvenient without them.

11
00:01:44,813 --> 00:01:48,233
What you're saying is true,
but doesn't AI have limitations?

12
00:01:48,316 --> 00:01:49,776
It doesn't always understand us.

13
00:01:49,859 --> 00:01:52,946
I don't mind that
as much as not being able to see its face.

14
00:01:53,029 --> 00:01:54,697
It feels like I'm talking to myself,

15
00:01:54,781 --> 00:01:57,200
so it doesn't feel
like it's present with me.

16
00:01:57,992 --> 00:01:59,953
Is it still too early for robots?

17
00:02:00,036 --> 00:02:04,207
Did you see the video of the humanoid AI
that Magic Mirror launched not long ago?

18
00:02:04,541 --> 00:02:06,960
It's been getting a lot of attention
on YouTube.

19
00:02:23,476 --> 00:02:26,020
As our investors,
all of you must be here today

20
00:02:26,104 --> 00:02:27,480
because you want to know

21
00:02:27,564 --> 00:02:30,358
what our company has been working on...

22
00:02:31,151 --> 00:02:35,446
since we were the first ones to develop AI
that passed the Turing test.

23
00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:43,288
How do you feel after having seen
GIO Lab's latest product?

24
00:02:45,999 --> 00:02:49,377
I introduce to you the world's
first personal hologram AI,

25
00:02:50,044 --> 00:02:51,838
Holo.

26
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:09,272
I don't know if you noticed,

27
00:03:09,355 --> 00:03:13,067
but the specially-engineered glass
between us

28
00:03:13,318 --> 00:03:16,905
made it seem like Holo is actually here.

29
00:03:24,662 --> 00:03:26,539
And you can access this hologram...

30
00:03:27,582 --> 00:03:29,417
through this pair of glasses.

31
00:03:34,964 --> 00:03:39,594
As of now, this is the world's
only prototype of HoloGlass.

32
00:03:40,428 --> 00:03:42,972
Anyone who wears these glasses...

33
00:03:43,806 --> 00:03:46,768
will be able to have
a Holo of their very own.

34
00:04:14,337 --> 00:04:17,090
Let's do this.

35
00:04:19,008 --> 00:04:20,551
Please turn that chair around.

36
00:04:20,635 --> 00:04:23,346
It'd be better to swap this
for the black line.

37
00:04:23,429 --> 00:04:25,932
-Thank you for your hard work. Okay.
-Thank you.

38
00:04:27,225 --> 00:04:29,352
-Let's put this box down.
-Yes, let's.

39
00:04:34,565 --> 00:04:36,025
Let's turn the lights on now.

40
00:04:36,109 --> 00:04:37,026
Okay.

41
00:04:38,236 --> 00:04:40,113
-Good. I think this is fine.
-Great.

42
00:04:40,196 --> 00:04:43,199
-Good work, everyone.
-Thank you for your hard work.

43
00:04:43,283 --> 00:04:44,534
Yes, thanks.

44
00:04:46,869 --> 00:04:49,914
I made a reservation
at the barbecue place nearby.

45
00:04:49,998 --> 00:04:51,916
I'll wrap things up here. Go on ahead.

46
00:04:52,333 --> 00:04:54,085
-I'm good, thanks.
-Excuse me?

47
00:04:54,168 --> 00:04:55,420
I'm a bit tired.

48
00:04:55,503 --> 00:04:57,922
I'll wrap things up and go home.
Don't worry about it.

49
00:04:58,006 --> 00:04:59,132
-Miss Han.
-Go home.

50
00:04:59,590 --> 00:05:00,967
You've been working hard.

51
00:05:01,050 --> 00:05:02,468
Let's go, sir. Let's go.

52
00:05:02,552 --> 00:05:03,886
Come on. Let's go.

53
00:05:05,305 --> 00:05:06,472
She's so cool.

54
00:05:06,556 --> 00:05:09,350
Cool? Yeah, right.
Attending team dinners is a duty too.

55
00:05:09,434 --> 00:05:11,477
Don't become like her
if you get promoted.

56
00:05:11,561 --> 00:05:13,313
-Yes, Miss Park.
-Good work.

57
00:05:13,396 --> 00:05:14,272
This way.

58
00:05:16,649 --> 00:05:18,860
-Please show them the way.
-Yes, ma'am.

59
00:05:18,943 --> 00:05:20,862
That was an impressive presentation.

60
00:05:21,946 --> 00:05:22,905
How beautiful.

61
00:05:22,989 --> 00:05:25,491
What an honor to have
the vice president come see it.

62
00:05:25,575 --> 00:05:27,827
That was tough
for me to swallow, though.

63
00:05:30,455 --> 00:05:34,083
A huge company like Magic Mirror
wouldn't act petty about this, right?

64
00:05:34,292 --> 00:05:36,169
I considered filing a lawsuit, but...

65
00:05:38,212 --> 00:05:42,759
it's true that Holo is much more advanced
than our current AI engine.

66
00:05:42,925 --> 00:05:46,012
How did you make it talk
in a natural language?

67
00:05:46,512 --> 00:05:48,931
That's a company secret.

68
00:05:49,307 --> 00:05:50,516
Speaking of which,

69
00:05:51,017 --> 00:05:53,936
my company buyout offer
from last time is still valid.

70
00:05:54,645 --> 00:05:56,314
As I told you last time--

71
00:05:57,523 --> 00:06:00,860
If you turn me down again,
you'll have to have dinner with me.

72
00:06:00,943 --> 00:06:04,822
If I'd known that was the case,
I would've cleared my schedule.

73
00:06:04,906 --> 00:06:07,075
I apologize, but I already have plans.

74
00:06:07,158 --> 00:06:10,495
Then I'll check to see if you have plans
before making this offer again.

75
00:06:11,162 --> 00:06:12,163
Take care.

76
00:06:22,799 --> 00:06:26,552
He's so persistent but so smooth, too.

77
00:06:30,723 --> 00:06:33,184
I wonder how many women
he's given these to.

78
00:06:34,018 --> 00:06:35,937
What good are they if I can't eat them?

79
00:06:43,986 --> 00:06:46,239
I've detected unidentified parties
chasing you.

80
00:06:49,409 --> 00:06:50,618
What do I do?

81
00:06:57,083 --> 00:06:58,126
Holo!

82
00:07:12,932 --> 00:07:15,017
This car has self-driving mode, right?

83
00:07:16,477 --> 00:07:18,104
-I'll drive.
-Hands off the wheel,

84
00:07:18,187 --> 00:07:20,398
-and don't be surprised if the car moves.
-Yes.

85
00:08:52,073 --> 00:08:52,949
Holo!

86
00:09:11,259 --> 00:09:12,385
Miss Ko!

87
00:09:22,144 --> 00:09:23,187
She's not here.

88
00:09:34,574 --> 00:09:35,825
This way.

89
00:09:56,053 --> 00:09:57,096
IDENTIFICATION FAILED

90
00:10:00,391 --> 00:10:02,226
They'll steal the glasses from me.

91
00:10:02,310 --> 00:10:04,103
-What do I do?
-Look around.

92
00:10:06,314 --> 00:10:07,690
RELIABILITY: 79%, 28%

93
00:10:10,693 --> 00:10:12,361
RELIABILITY: 28%, 19%

94
00:10:14,905 --> 00:10:16,115
RELIABILITY: 51%

95
00:10:52,068 --> 00:10:53,361
Holo.

96
00:10:54,403 --> 00:10:55,529
What's wrong?

97
00:10:56,364 --> 00:10:58,157
That woman. Give them to that woman.

98
00:11:04,789 --> 00:11:05,873
Sorry about that!

99
00:11:28,646 --> 00:11:29,772
It's not here.

100
00:11:34,276 --> 00:11:38,197
We failed to retrieve it.
I have someone else tailing them.

101
00:11:40,574 --> 00:11:45,579
SEOUL TAXI
EMPTY CAR

102
00:11:49,583 --> 00:11:51,585
Goodness, there must've been an accident.

103
00:12:20,322 --> 00:12:21,240
One caffe latte.

104
00:12:21,323 --> 00:12:22,742
-Sure.
-Not too much foam.

105
00:12:22,825 --> 00:12:23,659
Sure.

106
00:12:34,628 --> 00:12:36,547
What's this doing in my bag?

107
00:12:36,630 --> 00:12:38,549
NAME: HAN SO-YEON
DATE OF BIRTH: 1989.04.20

108
00:12:38,632 --> 00:12:41,051
They're not prescription.
Are they sample glasses?

109
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:44,096
They look nice.

110
00:12:44,889 --> 00:12:46,182
Let's see.

111
00:12:48,225 --> 00:12:50,478
-Here's your coffee.
-Yes, thank you.

112
00:12:52,396 --> 00:12:53,397
Be careful.

113
00:12:55,316 --> 00:12:56,400
Sorry.

114
00:12:58,611 --> 00:12:59,695
Oh, no.

115
00:13:00,863 --> 00:13:02,531
I'm sorry, are you okay...?

116
00:13:13,751 --> 00:13:18,798
I'm fine. By the way...
those glasses look great on you.

117
00:13:18,881 --> 00:13:21,383
Oh, yes, thank you.

118
00:13:21,967 --> 00:13:23,511
Where did he go?

119
00:13:30,726 --> 00:13:32,186
What were you doing?

120
00:13:34,230 --> 00:13:35,773
Oh, sir. Well...

121
00:13:36,398 --> 00:13:38,484
There was a man here, and...

122
00:13:38,567 --> 00:13:39,401
A man?

123
00:13:39,485 --> 00:13:44,073
Did he walk into you? Are you okay?
Damn it, what kind of a jerk--

124
00:13:44,156 --> 00:13:45,616
-No, that's not it.
-What?

125
00:13:45,699 --> 00:13:48,702
I'll just go and get ready
for the meeting, sir.

126
00:13:48,786 --> 00:13:50,287
Sure, okay.

127
00:14:09,098 --> 00:14:09,974
Yes.

128
00:14:10,558 --> 00:14:13,143
I'm heading back to the office now.

129
00:14:13,435 --> 00:14:17,231
Yes, I'll call you back right away.
All right.

130
00:14:25,531 --> 00:14:26,407
Oh, no.

131
00:14:28,784 --> 00:14:31,912
-Are you okay?
-Yes, I'm fine.

132
00:14:32,663 --> 00:14:35,583
-Goodness! Are you all right, Miss Park?
-It's just...

133
00:14:35,666 --> 00:14:36,959
Goodness.

134
00:14:37,042 --> 00:14:41,755
You should've told me to do this!
Does it hurt a lot?

135
00:14:42,298 --> 00:14:43,173
What?

136
00:14:43,424 --> 00:14:44,717
No, I'm fine.

137
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:46,218
I'll take these upstairs.

138
00:14:46,302 --> 00:14:47,720
Are you sure you're okay?

139
00:14:47,803 --> 00:14:49,346
-Good morning.
-Yes, hello.

140
00:14:49,430 --> 00:14:50,264
Hello.

141
00:14:53,309 --> 00:14:54,768
Hey, Miss Han!

142
00:14:59,189 --> 00:15:01,400
-Don't you have anything to say to me?
-No.

143
00:15:02,192 --> 00:15:03,903
Are you kidding me?

144
00:15:04,069 --> 00:15:06,530
Are you just going to pretend
you can't see me anymore?

145
00:15:06,614 --> 00:15:08,490
You saw me right there.

146
00:15:09,700 --> 00:15:10,576
Oh, right.

147
00:15:10,659 --> 00:15:11,619
"Oh, right"?

148
00:15:12,828 --> 00:15:14,830
Is that all you have to say to me?

149
00:15:14,914 --> 00:15:17,291
-You must seriously look down on me!
-Hey, Miss Park.

150
00:15:17,374 --> 00:15:19,293
-No, I just...
-What's going on?

151
00:15:19,376 --> 00:15:20,878
-What's wrong?
-The thing is,

152
00:15:20,961 --> 00:15:23,213
I was almost seriously injured just now.

153
00:15:23,297 --> 00:15:26,759
Anyway, she saw me right there,
so I thought she'd help me,

154
00:15:26,842 --> 00:15:29,720
but she totally ignored me
and got on the elevator.

155
00:15:38,562 --> 00:15:40,147
I'm so upset.

156
00:15:40,606 --> 00:15:43,651
We've been working together for years now.

157
00:15:43,734 --> 00:15:45,569
You should've helped her. Am I wrong?

158
00:15:45,653 --> 00:15:47,613
Let's go and have some coffee.

159
00:15:48,530 --> 00:15:51,075
You know, don't you think

160
00:15:51,158 --> 00:15:54,036
that Mr. Yeon gives Miss Han
special treatment?

161
00:15:54,119 --> 00:15:55,162
I agree.

162
00:15:55,245 --> 00:15:56,538
-Exactly.
-Do you think...

163
00:15:57,498 --> 00:15:59,124
they're seeing each other?

164
00:15:59,208 --> 00:16:00,334
What?

165
00:16:00,417 --> 00:16:03,212
He was her senior in college.
He likes her as an employee.

166
00:16:03,295 --> 00:16:05,214
But she's seriously such a bitch.

167
00:16:05,673 --> 00:16:08,175
I mean, if you see someone,
you should say hello, right?

168
00:16:08,258 --> 00:16:11,512
But I always say hi to her first.
And whenever I do that,

169
00:16:11,637 --> 00:16:13,222
she just looks at me and walks by.

170
00:16:13,806 --> 00:16:15,557
And she always skips team dinners.

171
00:16:25,109 --> 00:16:26,360
Hey, So-yeon.

172
00:16:26,443 --> 00:16:27,736
-Yes?
-Are you all right?

173
00:16:32,825 --> 00:16:35,160
-Gang-woo.
-You didn't recognize me just now,

174
00:16:35,244 --> 00:16:39,039
-did you?
-No, I was just distracted.

175
00:16:39,498 --> 00:16:41,166
Why didn't you tell me?

176
00:16:42,418 --> 00:16:44,712
-About what?
-You have terrible eyesight, right?

177
00:16:44,795 --> 00:16:47,464
That's why you didn't notice
Miss Park earlier either.

178
00:16:49,091 --> 00:16:51,051
-The thing is--
-Why don't you get contacts?

179
00:16:55,180 --> 00:16:56,724
I'm allergic to them.

180
00:16:57,307 --> 00:16:59,977
Get glasses, then.
I think glasses would look nice on you.

181
00:17:47,608 --> 00:17:51,028
Hey, Yoo-ram!
How about we have some soju and beer?

182
00:17:52,112 --> 00:17:53,447
I have to head out right now.

183
00:17:53,530 --> 00:17:55,657
I just got asked to work
a flight last minute.

184
00:17:55,741 --> 00:17:59,411
You're always heading out. Goodness.

185
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:06,585
On a lonely day

186
00:18:07,503 --> 00:18:10,881
On a day we long for a friend

187
00:18:11,590 --> 00:18:14,051
We make one

188
00:18:15,052 --> 00:18:18,347
That is cute and fascinating

189
00:18:30,484 --> 00:18:33,403
I'm making friends

190
00:18:33,487 --> 00:18:36,573
That nobody else knows about

191
00:18:38,117 --> 00:18:41,495
Let's make a friend, Ppyororong

192
00:18:44,039 --> 00:18:44,998
My friend

193
00:18:45,082 --> 00:18:46,083
There we go.

194
00:18:58,220 --> 00:18:59,847
It's so nice being alone.

195
00:19:00,264 --> 00:19:02,307
Yes. Seriously, this is great.

196
00:19:03,142 --> 00:19:04,601
This is so much easier.

197
00:19:19,992 --> 00:19:21,535
Oh, right.

198
00:19:22,578 --> 00:19:26,748
He said that glasses
would look good on me.

199
00:19:48,187 --> 00:19:51,523
Gosh, I can't see a thing.

200
00:19:52,774 --> 00:19:54,568
I told you, they look good on you.

201
00:19:56,570 --> 00:19:58,197
Oh, my gosh! Who are you?

202
00:19:59,198 --> 00:20:02,034
Don't you remember me
from back at the coffee shop?

203
00:20:03,118 --> 00:20:05,913
-Let me introduce myself. I'm--
-Are you a stalker?

204
00:20:06,330 --> 00:20:08,123
-Let me explain--
-Don't come closer!

205
00:20:14,463 --> 00:20:15,464
Oh, this?

206
00:20:16,965 --> 00:20:18,258
Give me a moment to--

207
00:20:18,759 --> 00:20:20,260
Mom!

208
00:20:21,511 --> 00:20:22,471
Mom!

209
00:20:24,806 --> 00:20:26,558
You still can't find them?

210
00:20:30,312 --> 00:20:31,480
All right.

211
00:20:42,908 --> 00:20:45,285
I brought really sturdy fake flowers
this time.

212
00:20:45,744 --> 00:20:47,996
They'll be fine
even if your car flips over.

213
00:20:48,789 --> 00:20:49,665
Sure.

214
00:20:49,748 --> 00:20:50,874
I was worried about you.

215
00:20:51,124 --> 00:20:53,001
I heard you got into a car accident.

216
00:20:54,127 --> 00:20:57,089
-I know, right?
-I feel bad because I feel like...

217
00:20:57,381 --> 00:20:59,049
-it was my fault.
-Sorry?

218
00:20:59,132 --> 00:21:01,969
If I'd asked you
on a proper date that day,

219
00:21:02,052 --> 00:21:05,430
we would've had dinner,
and I would've dropped you off at home.

220
00:21:05,514 --> 00:21:06,515
Stop it.

221
00:21:06,598 --> 00:21:09,059
As you can see, I'm fine.

222
00:21:10,143 --> 00:21:13,063
Take this chance to be a little fussy
and get some rest.

223
00:21:13,146 --> 00:21:15,941
I'm sure you must've been busy
preparing for the conference.

224
00:21:17,734 --> 00:21:19,653
Oh, no. I don't have any makeup on.

225
00:21:22,155 --> 00:21:25,075
I've never seen you like this.
You look like a different person.

226
00:21:25,158 --> 00:21:27,286
-What?
-I'm saying you look attractive.

227
00:21:33,709 --> 00:21:37,129
I beg of you.

228
00:21:42,926 --> 00:21:45,345
Gosh. What am I even doing?

229
00:21:48,890 --> 00:21:49,808
Right.

230
00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:52,644
My eyes
could've been playing tricks on me.

231
00:22:02,446 --> 00:22:03,322
What?

232
00:22:05,991 --> 00:22:07,117
He's not here.

233
00:22:08,618 --> 00:22:10,704
Excuse me, I have something to tell you...

234
00:22:15,792 --> 00:22:18,086
Where are you? Where?

235
00:22:18,503 --> 00:22:20,339
You freaked out so much, so...

236
00:22:24,676 --> 00:22:26,845
Please calm down first.

237
00:22:28,805 --> 00:22:31,391
I knew it. These glasses are cursed.

238
00:22:32,267 --> 00:22:33,143
Damn it!

239
00:22:35,979 --> 00:22:37,689
MOM

240
00:22:41,526 --> 00:22:42,694
Mom.

241
00:22:42,778 --> 00:22:44,613
I see someone still believes in ghosts.

242
00:22:45,572 --> 00:22:47,991
Wow, the ghost is even calling me now?

243
00:22:48,075 --> 00:22:50,911
I must be out of my mind.

244
00:22:50,994 --> 00:22:52,120
Put the glasses back on.

245
00:22:52,204 --> 00:22:53,538
You think I'm crazy?

246
00:22:55,665 --> 00:22:56,500
Sir?

247
00:22:58,710 --> 00:23:00,879
I'm sorry, sir.

248
00:23:01,588 --> 00:23:06,051
Can't you just go the hell away, please?

249
00:23:06,510 --> 00:23:09,346
I'll explain everything,
so just put the glasses back...

250
00:23:13,725 --> 00:23:14,976
I'm not a ghost.

251
00:23:32,119 --> 00:23:32,953
Glasses.

252
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:35,622
Fine! Jeez!

253
00:23:35,705 --> 00:23:39,292
I'll put them on, all right?
I'll put them on right now!

254
00:23:39,376 --> 00:23:40,502
Darn it.

255
00:24:04,818 --> 00:24:06,111
The thing is...

256
00:24:06,194 --> 00:24:10,198
people say that I have a bitchy attitude,

257
00:24:10,282 --> 00:24:13,452
but I'm not a bad person, I swear.

258
00:24:13,952 --> 00:24:16,246
Please, spare me.

259
00:24:16,329 --> 00:24:18,373
I have no intention of killing you,
Miss Han.

260
00:24:20,917 --> 00:24:22,586
You know me?

261
00:24:22,669 --> 00:24:24,337
Han So-yeon, 30 years old.

262
00:24:25,005 --> 00:24:27,632
Working in marketing
for Prism Optical for five years.

263
00:24:27,716 --> 00:24:29,676
Has people badmouthing her
behind her back

264
00:24:29,759 --> 00:24:31,094
but isn't affected by it...

265
00:24:31,761 --> 00:24:32,596
or so it seems.

266
00:24:33,180 --> 00:24:36,266
In reality though, she's sensitive...
and gets hurt easily.

267
00:24:36,975 --> 00:24:38,518
How do you know all that?

268
00:24:38,602 --> 00:24:41,104
Are you my ancestor, by any chance?

269
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:43,690
I don't have a descendant like you,
Miss Han.

270
00:24:43,899 --> 00:24:47,235
Allow me to properly introduce myself.
The world's first hologram AI

271
00:24:47,319 --> 00:24:49,321
that only you can see
with those glasses on.

272
00:24:49,613 --> 00:24:50,614
I'm Holo.

273
00:24:55,994 --> 00:24:58,747
You're an AI?

274
00:24:58,830 --> 00:25:01,333
You believe in ghosts but not in AI?

275
00:25:01,416 --> 00:25:02,792
No, that's not it.

276
00:25:02,876 --> 00:25:04,920
How do you have a shadow
if you're a hologram?

277
00:25:05,378 --> 00:25:09,007
I don't want to look like a ghost.
When it's cold, you can see my breath too.

278
00:25:10,133 --> 00:25:10,967
EXHALING

279
00:25:12,344 --> 00:25:14,513
You can disable this feature.
Would you like to?

280
00:25:14,596 --> 00:25:16,640
How is it that I can hear you, then?

281
00:25:17,307 --> 00:25:20,060
Through bone conduction headphones.
Only you can hear me.

282
00:25:20,477 --> 00:25:24,272
It'd be best to check if other people
are around before talking to me.

283
00:25:24,356 --> 00:25:26,942
-If you don't--
-People will think I'm crazy.

284
00:25:36,826 --> 00:25:37,661
What?

285
00:25:47,170 --> 00:25:48,547
The glasses are solar-powered,

286
00:25:48,630 --> 00:25:51,132
so as long as you wear them
all the time...

287
00:25:59,474 --> 00:26:00,600
Oh, my gosh.

288
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:05,021
You're just like a real person.
You look and sound like one.

289
00:26:05,105 --> 00:26:06,064
Of course I do.

290
00:26:06,606 --> 00:26:09,276
Not only am I running
on the best natural-speech algorithm,

291
00:26:09,359 --> 00:26:11,903
but I also passed the Turing Test
with flying colors.

292
00:26:11,987 --> 00:26:16,741
By the way, the Turing Test is a test
that Alan Turing developed in 1950

293
00:26:16,825 --> 00:26:19,536
to test how much a machine
can mimic human speech--

294
00:26:19,619 --> 00:26:21,913
I guess you're an AI
since you're so smart.

295
00:26:21,997 --> 00:26:25,166
-But still, this can't be.
-You can talk casually with me,

296
00:26:25,959 --> 00:26:29,629
-Master.
-"Master"? Me? Goodness.

297
00:26:29,713 --> 00:26:31,631
Why are you calling me that?

298
00:26:31,715 --> 00:26:33,842
There was a minor delivery issue,
actually.

299
00:26:33,925 --> 00:26:36,928
And that was how I was able to meet you,
Miss Han.

300
00:26:37,053 --> 00:26:38,555
"A delivery issue"?

301
00:26:38,722 --> 00:26:41,516
Someone from our company
will be here to retrieve me soon,

302
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:44,060
so just think of this
as a beta test of sorts.

303
00:26:44,144 --> 00:26:46,563
Feel free to use me
as much as you'd like until then.

304
00:26:48,356 --> 00:26:49,357
No.

305
00:26:49,566 --> 00:26:51,484
No, thanks.

306
00:26:51,818 --> 00:26:53,486
"No, thanks"? Why do you say that?

307
00:26:54,654 --> 00:26:58,575
No reason. You're going to do this,
then charge me a bunch of fees later.

308
00:26:58,908 --> 00:27:00,994
I've been scammed like that
too many times.

309
00:27:01,077 --> 00:27:02,579
No, I'd never do that--

310
00:27:02,662 --> 00:27:04,289
Forget it. Where should I

311
00:27:04,372 --> 00:27:06,875
-return these to?
-"Return"?

312
00:27:09,628 --> 00:27:12,964
Listen, I'm the world's
best holographic AI.

313
00:27:13,048 --> 00:27:16,051
And you've been given a chance
to use me before anyone else has.

314
00:27:16,134 --> 00:27:17,886
You'll never get another chance...

315
00:27:23,099 --> 00:27:23,975
Darn it.

316
00:27:30,106 --> 00:27:32,192
This looks like the company's logo.

-I'm going on a last-minute business trip.

Work with other people who have less work,

325

or do it by yourself.

326
00:28:01,888 --> 00:28:02,764
Bye.

327
00:28:08,603 --> 00:28:10,063
-Ji-hye?
-Hey.

328
00:28:10,146 --> 00:28:11,231
Yes?

329
00:28:11,314 --> 00:28:13,191
Didn't you want to ask me something?

330
00:28:13,274 --> 00:28:14,776
-What do you mean?
-Darn it,

331
00:28:14,859 --> 00:28:16,820
-it crashed!
-Oh, this is what it was.

332
00:28:16,903 --> 00:28:19,864
This? Well, this probably...

333
00:28:26,746 --> 00:28:28,665
Nan-hee, could you possibly--

334
00:28:28,748 --> 00:28:31,084
Nan-hee already left.

335
00:28:31,167 --> 00:28:32,210
Oh, I see.

336
00:28:32,293 --> 00:28:34,045
If you're not busy,
could you help me--

337
00:28:34,129 --> 00:28:39,467
Dong-sik told me I have some work to do
outside the office, so...

338
00:28:40,260 --> 00:28:41,386
Good luck!

339
00:28:53,022 --> 00:28:54,065
Two days?

340
00:28:57,485 --> 00:28:59,529
No, I bet it will take
at least three days.

341
00:29:05,618 --> 00:29:07,537
This is Han So-yeon
of Marketing at Prism.

342
00:29:07,620 --> 00:29:09,164
-It's me.
-Who--

343
00:29:09,247 --> 00:29:10,290
Want me to help you?

344
00:29:10,373 --> 00:29:12,584
I'm really good at organizing documents.

345
00:29:12,667 --> 00:29:15,920
I could do it faster
than all the other employees put together.

346
00:29:16,421 --> 00:29:17,839
Just put those glasses on.

347
00:29:32,312 --> 00:29:34,022
Oh, my gosh.

348
00:29:36,816 --> 00:29:40,236
So, how can you help me, sir?

349
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:42,197
You don't need to be so formal.

350
00:29:42,572 --> 00:29:43,698
By the way,

351
00:29:44,157 --> 00:29:46,367
I looked up these glasses online,

352
00:29:46,451 --> 00:29:49,120
but I couldn't find which brand they are.

353
00:29:49,204 --> 00:29:52,457
It's a top-secret prototype
that hasn't been made public yet.

354
00:29:52,540 --> 00:29:53,833
I told you.

355
00:29:53,917 --> 00:29:58,546
You're the first ordinary person
in the world who's trying them out.

356
00:29:58,963 --> 00:30:02,467
You're really not going to charge me,
right?

357
00:30:02,550 --> 00:30:03,760
Of course not.

358
00:30:03,968 --> 00:30:06,387
All right, then. Shall we get started?

359
00:30:07,055 --> 00:30:09,057
Those documents
are on the server, right?

360
00:30:38,795 --> 00:30:40,046
Oh, my.

361
00:30:55,979 --> 00:30:57,730
-Miss Han.
-Yes, sir?

362
00:31:03,403 --> 00:31:04,529
This is amazing.

363
00:31:17,375 --> 00:31:18,459
What's wrong?

364
00:31:20,461 --> 00:31:21,296
What on earth?

365
00:31:21,671 --> 00:31:23,214
Isn't that our office?

366
00:31:23,298 --> 00:31:25,341
-What?
-What's going on?

367
00:31:25,425 --> 00:31:26,551
Well...

368
00:31:26,926 --> 00:31:29,554
she must be stressed
since she's working late by herself.

369
00:31:30,138 --> 00:31:31,931
Who cares? Let's go. Come on.

370
00:31:32,015 --> 00:31:34,559
-I told you, what if someone sees?
-Whatever, it's fine.

371
00:31:54,078 --> 00:31:57,040
I would've been working overtime
on that for three days.

372
00:31:58,666 --> 00:32:02,420
But it took less than three hours, right?
This is what I'm capable of.

373
00:32:07,050 --> 00:32:09,761
What is it?
Did I fail to meet your expectations?

374
00:32:09,844 --> 00:32:12,388
What? No, that's not it.
No, it's just that...

375
00:32:13,264 --> 00:32:14,349
you're so amazing.

376
00:32:15,850 --> 00:32:18,603
I'm still weirded out
even though I'm amazed.

377
00:32:18,937 --> 00:32:20,939
You'll get used to it soon enough.

378
00:32:21,689 --> 00:32:24,609
Anyway, you want to use me now, right?

379
00:32:25,944 --> 00:32:28,571
Well, for now...

380
00:32:29,489 --> 00:32:32,617
I'd like you to help me
until I'm done with this project.

381
00:32:33,242 --> 00:32:34,369
Sure.

382
00:32:34,702 --> 00:32:37,205
-Do you know the Three Rules of Robotics?
-The what?

383
00:32:37,288 --> 00:32:41,209
I also have three rules similar to those
that I have to follow.

384
00:32:41,542 --> 00:32:45,421
Rule number one:
I should work for my user's happiness.

385
00:32:45,505 --> 00:32:48,591
If my user doesn't want me
to do something, I must stop immediately.

386
00:32:48,675 --> 00:32:50,551
Rule number two: I should comply

387
00:32:50,635 --> 00:32:52,512
-with laws of the user's country.
-Okay.

388
00:32:52,595 --> 00:32:56,474
Rule number three:
I should not lie to my user.

389
00:33:03,731 --> 00:33:04,899
Sure, I'm down.

390
00:33:07,026 --> 00:33:08,277
Sure, I'm down.

391
00:33:12,573 --> 00:33:14,283
Are there rules I have to follow?

392
00:33:14,367 --> 00:33:17,245
Not many.
You can use me as much as you'd like,

393
00:33:17,328 --> 00:33:20,581
but you can't give the glasses to anyone
or let anyone else wear them.

394
00:33:20,665 --> 00:33:24,210
You can't tell anyone about me either
since I'm yet to be launched.

395
00:33:24,335 --> 00:33:26,421
Well, that's not too hard.

396
00:33:27,922 --> 00:33:29,882
Now, allow me to explain my features.

397
00:33:29,966 --> 00:33:32,343
-Firstly, you can customize my appearance.
-Okay.

398
00:33:32,427 --> 00:33:36,305
In the future, you'll be able to customize
my ethnicity, height, face,

399
00:33:36,764 --> 00:33:38,224
and even body type.

400
00:33:38,307 --> 00:33:40,727
But for now,
you can choose between different styles.

401
00:33:40,810 --> 00:33:41,644
Sure.

402
00:33:42,270 --> 00:33:44,439
What? Oh, my gosh!

403
00:33:44,522 --> 00:33:45,732
A bad boy.

404
00:33:47,108 --> 00:33:50,028
A hot male secretary.
Miss Han, your schedule for today is--

405
00:33:50,111 --> 00:33:51,237
Clock out for the day.

406
00:33:51,320 --> 00:33:54,615
Some people like this too.
The artistic "sad boy" type.

407
00:33:55,324 --> 00:33:57,994
Sorry, you're not making it
to the next round.

408
00:34:02,874 --> 00:34:04,667
Know the rules you brought up earlier?

409
00:34:04,751 --> 00:34:06,210
I want to set a rule too.

410
00:34:06,294 --> 00:34:07,170
What is it?

411
00:34:07,253 --> 00:34:11,090
First, change back to exactly
how you originally looked.

412
00:34:14,093 --> 00:34:15,595
Was my first look more your type?

413
00:34:22,477 --> 00:34:26,022
Don't show up with different clothes
or in a different style all of a sudden.

414
00:34:26,230 --> 00:34:28,941
Just stay exactly the way you are now.

415
00:34:29,025 --> 00:34:31,694
-That's my one rule for you.
-Sorry?

416
00:34:32,945 --> 00:34:35,823
I apologize if this is too forward,
but why?

417
00:34:38,367 --> 00:34:39,368
Well...

418
00:34:42,080 --> 00:34:43,331
no reason in particular.

419
00:34:49,337 --> 00:34:51,672
You did all of this
by yourself in one day?

420
00:34:52,381 --> 00:34:53,633
It's great.

421
00:34:54,300 --> 00:34:55,676
And it's organized so well.

422
00:34:56,719 --> 00:34:59,722
-Those glasses look good on you too.
-Thank you.

423
00:35:13,528 --> 00:35:16,155
Your heart rate is abnormal, Miss Han.

424
00:35:17,865 --> 00:35:18,783
Sure.

425
00:35:21,119 --> 00:35:23,079
Wait, you have that kind of feature too?

426
00:35:23,162 --> 00:35:24,080
Yes.

427
00:35:24,288 --> 00:35:26,624
Is that musical ticket
from earlier bothering you?

428
00:35:26,707 --> 00:35:28,126
What are you talking about?

429
00:35:29,252 --> 00:35:30,503
-You saw it too?
-Of course.

430
00:35:33,756 --> 00:35:35,508
A ticket for a show on February 15th.

431
00:35:36,050 --> 00:35:38,386
It's just because that day
is Gang-woo's birthday.

432
00:35:40,138 --> 00:35:41,931
Who do you think he's going with?

433
00:35:42,014 --> 00:35:44,892
I've heard that show's really popular
among couples these days.

434
00:35:45,226 --> 00:35:47,228
No idea.

435
00:35:48,146 --> 00:35:50,898
He's really popular, after all.

436
00:35:53,442 --> 00:35:56,612
What?
I'm going to be accompanying our CEO?

437
00:35:56,696 --> 00:36:00,449
He must have really loved the way
you planned the launch party,

438
00:36:00,533 --> 00:36:03,494
seeing as how he's asked you
to accompany him at the event.

439
00:36:03,578 --> 00:36:06,622
But to assign this kind of work to me
without any prior notice--

440
00:36:06,706 --> 00:36:07,748
Isn't it great?

441
00:36:07,832 --> 00:36:10,543
You'll get some face-to-face time
with the CEO.

442
00:36:11,002 --> 00:36:14,964
Here are the photos and profiles
of all the VIPs attending the party.

443
00:36:15,047 --> 00:36:17,758
All you need to do is tell him
who's who, okay?

444
00:36:18,467 --> 00:36:19,594
Wait.

445
00:36:20,761 --> 00:36:21,804
Yes, Mr. Kim.

446
00:36:22,638 --> 00:36:24,140
Oh, hello. You're here.

447
00:36:26,934 --> 00:36:28,978
LEE JONG-RAE, CEO OF JJ PRODUCTION

448
00:36:34,108 --> 00:36:36,319
Jeez, this is driving me crazy.

449
00:36:36,402 --> 00:36:37,320
What's wrong?

450
00:36:37,945 --> 00:36:40,948
-It doesn't seem that difficult to me.
-Well,

451
00:36:41,657 --> 00:36:42,575
the thing is...

452
00:36:47,622 --> 00:36:48,539
Never mind.

453
00:36:54,337 --> 00:36:56,756
If you're next to me,
I might get confused.

454
00:36:56,839 --> 00:37:00,927
I might start talking to you,
so don't show up during the event, okay?

455
00:37:07,975 --> 00:37:09,685
-Welcome.
-Welcome.

456
00:37:14,523 --> 00:37:16,609
-Welcome.
-Long time no see.

457
00:37:16,692 --> 00:37:19,528
-Welcome.
-Yes, hello.

458
00:37:20,446 --> 00:37:22,281
POMADE, HORN-RIMMED GLASSES,

459
00:37:22,865 --> 00:37:25,660
Hwang Jeong-ho, editor-in-chief
of Man to Man men's magazine.

460
00:37:25,743 --> 00:37:27,954
They wrote
a good review of our products.

461
00:37:28,037 --> 00:37:29,538
-This is our CEO.
-I see.

462
00:37:29,622 --> 00:37:32,166
Thank you for coming, Editor-in-Chief.

463
00:37:32,250 --> 00:37:34,543
My name is Hwang Jeong-ho.
I like the shop's vibe.

464
00:37:34,627 --> 00:37:35,670
Thank you.

465
00:37:35,753 --> 00:37:36,963
-Welcome.
-Hello.

466
00:37:38,005 --> 00:37:38,881
See you later.

467
00:37:38,965 --> 00:37:40,299
How are you?

468
00:37:41,342 --> 00:37:42,885
Long time no see, sir.

469
00:37:44,220 --> 00:37:45,429
Long time no see!

470
00:37:45,513 --> 00:37:47,515
-You're doing well, I presume?
-Yes.

471
00:37:48,599 --> 00:37:50,017
Kim Jeong-u, a photographer.

472
00:37:50,935 --> 00:37:54,981
I love your photos, Mr. Kim.

473
00:37:55,064 --> 00:37:57,525
-Thank you, sir.
-Take your time and look around.

474
00:37:57,608 --> 00:37:59,235
-Let me show you around.
-All right.

475
00:38:04,115 --> 00:38:05,491
-Welcome.
-Hello.

476
00:38:05,574 --> 00:38:07,451
Welcome. I'll take you inside.

477
00:38:07,868 --> 00:38:10,413
-Is she a celebrity?
-I don't watch much TV.

478
00:38:10,496 --> 00:38:14,250
If she's a celebrity,
she has to be one of these three.

479
00:38:15,793 --> 00:38:17,670
-I apologize.
-It's fine.

480
00:38:23,092 --> 00:38:26,470
-Goodness, hello!
-Looks like we have a real VIP here.

481
00:38:26,554 --> 00:38:28,306
-How have you been?
-Good, thank you.

482
00:38:28,389 --> 00:38:30,308
-Who's she?
-You've been doing well, right?

483
00:38:30,391 --> 00:38:31,434
-Yes.
-Miss Han.

484
00:38:34,353 --> 00:38:36,063
-Holo?
-She's RD, the singer.

485
00:38:36,147 --> 00:38:37,565
You listen to her songs often.

486
00:38:38,607 --> 00:38:40,693
RD.
Her famous song is "Just One More Time."

487
00:38:40,776 --> 00:38:43,195
I've been keeping up with
what you've been doing,

488
00:38:43,279 --> 00:38:44,655
-Miss RD.
-Don't worry.

489
00:38:45,072 --> 00:38:47,575
I'll analyze their faces
and tell you who's who.

490
00:38:47,992 --> 00:38:49,452
Holo, are you, by any chance...

491
00:38:52,330 --> 00:38:54,457
Here comes Ryu Yong-jae, a model.

492
00:38:54,540 --> 00:38:57,877
-Behind him is Kim Han-chae, a novelist.
-This is Ryu Yong-jae, a model.

493
00:38:57,960 --> 00:38:59,587
-Kim Han-chae, a novelist.
-Hello.

494
00:38:59,670 --> 00:39:01,255
Yes, long time no see.

495
00:39:01,339 --> 00:39:03,716
You look as fashionable as ever.

496
00:39:03,924 --> 00:39:06,010
Please go ahead.

497
00:39:12,224 --> 00:39:14,185
What would I have done without you?

498
00:39:14,894 --> 00:39:15,853
Thanks, Holo.

499
00:39:21,484 --> 00:39:24,111
So does this mean you knew

500
00:39:24,195 --> 00:39:27,198
-that I can't recognize faces?
-I have a vision tracking function.

501
00:39:27,698 --> 00:39:30,576
When you look at people,
you don't look at their faces.

502
00:39:30,993 --> 00:39:32,828
You suffer from face blindness, right?

503
00:39:34,038 --> 00:39:34,872
Yeah.

504
00:39:38,334 --> 00:39:41,337
To tell you the truth, only my mom knows.

505
00:39:43,881 --> 00:39:46,801
Everyone's face just looks...

506
00:39:47,551 --> 00:39:48,928
blurry to me.

507
00:39:49,637 --> 00:39:54,058
I can only tell who people are
by their voices or outfits.

508
00:39:54,809 --> 00:39:56,644
I got this condition as a kid...

509
00:39:58,854 --> 00:40:00,689
They told me it's a psychological thing,

510
00:40:00,773 --> 00:40:03,943
so I went to a lot of doctors
and got some therapy as well.

511
00:40:05,027 --> 00:40:06,487
But none of it worked.

512
00:40:06,612 --> 00:40:08,447
Isn't it hard to keep that a secret?

513
00:40:09,031 --> 00:40:11,617
People may get the wrong impression.
Why keep it a secret?

514
00:40:14,328 --> 00:40:16,831
-For no reason.
-"No reason"?

515
00:40:20,334 --> 00:40:22,837
You say that often.

516
00:40:22,920 --> 00:40:25,589
But is there truly no reason behind it?

517
00:40:26,674 --> 00:40:28,175
When people say "for no reason,"

518
00:40:28,259 --> 00:40:31,262
it's usually not because they have
no reason behind it.

519
00:40:31,470 --> 00:40:33,639
They either don't want to talk about it,

520
00:40:33,848 --> 00:40:36,475
-or don't understand their feelings.
-You don't understand

521
00:40:36,559 --> 00:40:38,394
-your own feelings?
-Yeah.

522
00:40:43,190 --> 00:40:47,236
I feel like I'm learning important things
while spending time with you.

523
00:40:47,319 --> 00:40:49,989
-Like the phrase "no reason"?
-Yes, I like it.

524
00:40:51,407 --> 00:40:52,241
For no reason.

525
00:41:17,641 --> 00:41:19,310
On your right is Mr. Park.

526
00:41:19,810 --> 00:41:21,395
Hello.

527
00:41:21,479 --> 00:41:23,731
Miss Han, that is Manager Park.

528
00:41:31,572 --> 00:41:32,781
It's Dong-sik.

529
00:41:43,751 --> 00:41:45,211
Good morning, Dong-sik.

530
00:41:45,961 --> 00:41:47,463
Yes, good morning.

531
00:41:53,010 --> 00:41:53,844
Hello.

532
00:41:57,181 --> 00:41:58,098
Hello.

533
00:41:59,725 --> 00:42:00,976
Here comes Mr. Song.

534
00:42:01,602 --> 00:42:02,853
Hello, Mr. Song.

535
00:42:06,524 --> 00:42:08,192
You're early today, Gyeong-in.

536
00:42:08,567 --> 00:42:10,653
I love your outfit today, Nan-hee.

537
00:42:11,278 --> 00:42:12,696
Thank you.

538
00:42:17,451 --> 00:42:18,536
Gang-woo's coming.

539
00:42:25,709 --> 00:42:27,169
-Gang-woo.
-Hey.

540
00:42:27,253 --> 00:42:29,004
-Did you have lunch already?
-Yeah.

541
00:42:29,088 --> 00:42:30,422
-Did you?
-Yes.

542
00:42:34,343 --> 00:42:35,511
I'll be going now.

543
00:42:45,896 --> 00:42:47,398
See you tomorrow, Ji-hye.

544
00:42:47,481 --> 00:42:48,983
Miss Han.

545
00:42:49,066 --> 00:42:51,902
We have a team dinner tonight.
Did you hear about it?

546
00:42:51,986 --> 00:42:54,321
It's fine if you can't make it.

547
00:42:54,405 --> 00:42:55,781
-I'll come.
-What?

548
00:42:56,615 --> 00:42:59,535
Well, I'll text you the address, then.

549
00:42:59,660 --> 00:43:00,578
See you later.

550
00:43:04,623 --> 00:43:05,874
Good work, everyone.

551
00:43:05,958 --> 00:43:07,585
-Good work!
-All right, cheers.

552
00:43:07,668 --> 00:43:08,627
Cheers!

553
00:43:12,548 --> 00:43:14,508
Gosh, what's the occasion?

554
00:43:14,592 --> 00:43:16,844
I can't believe Miss Han came
to a team dinner.

555
00:43:16,927 --> 00:43:19,471
I'm so happy to have you here, Miss Han.

556
00:43:19,555 --> 00:43:21,181
-I'm happy too, Ji-hye.
-All right,

557
00:43:21,265 --> 00:43:23,601
-cheers!
-Miss Han.

558
00:43:24,685 --> 00:43:25,978
Miss Park is coming.

559
00:43:27,813 --> 00:43:30,065
-Over here, Miss Park.
-Hey.

560
00:43:30,733 --> 00:43:33,152
-Hey.
-Hurry over. Sit over here.

561
00:43:33,235 --> 00:43:34,236
Goodness.

562
00:43:34,320 --> 00:43:36,697
-Congratulations.
-Why are you so late?

563
00:43:36,864 --> 00:43:37,698
Goodness.

564
00:43:37,781 --> 00:43:40,492
I can't believe you came
to something like this, Miss Han.

565
00:43:40,576 --> 00:43:43,120
I heard you accompanied
the CEO at the event, too.

566
00:43:43,203 --> 00:43:44,288
That must've been hard.

567
00:43:44,371 --> 00:43:48,167
Yes. I really wanted to come
after getting the hard work done.

568
00:43:48,334 --> 00:43:51,086
Really? Drink up.
I should too. I want some beer.

569
00:43:51,170 --> 00:43:53,672
Sure. One more glass of beer, please!

570
00:43:53,756 --> 00:43:56,175
Here's a brain teaser for you.
What do you call a cow

571
00:43:56,258 --> 00:43:58,135
-that plays piano?
-Dad jokes again.

572
00:43:58,218 --> 00:44:00,179
-I don't even want to hear it.
-A cow?

573
00:44:00,262 --> 00:44:03,182
-A moo-sician. Get it?
-Come on, sir!

574
00:44:10,105 --> 00:44:13,275
You've changed a lot recently.

575
00:44:13,359 --> 00:44:16,612
-Really? I wonder what caused it.
-Maybe it's the glasses.

576
00:44:18,822 --> 00:44:20,949
See? I told you you'd look pretty in them.

577
00:44:21,784 --> 00:44:23,702
By the way, take this.

578
00:44:24,995 --> 00:44:26,997
-Is this--
-I made you do all the work...

579
00:44:27,414 --> 00:44:28,832
and couldn't even help you.

580
00:44:29,041 --> 00:44:31,335
I felt bad, so I got it on the way here.

581
00:44:32,127 --> 00:44:34,505
-Take it. My arm is getting sore.
-Oh, okay.

582
00:44:36,924 --> 00:44:37,883
Thank you.

583
00:44:55,609 --> 00:44:56,944
Ask him to go with you.

584
00:44:58,696 --> 00:45:00,489
To go with me?

585
00:45:04,410 --> 00:45:09,248
Come on, he could've just given them
to me for all my hard work.

586
00:45:09,331 --> 00:45:11,792
Don't you want to ask him?
Isn't that how you feel?

587
00:45:29,101 --> 00:45:30,436
I'll pour you one.

588
00:45:30,519 --> 00:45:31,603
Find an empty cup.

589
00:45:31,687 --> 00:45:34,189
Here. To Prism!

590
00:45:34,273 --> 00:45:36,316
To Prism!

591
00:45:36,400 --> 00:45:37,234
You're drunk.

592
00:45:37,317 --> 00:45:39,153
You're drunk, sir.

593
00:45:40,237 --> 00:45:42,948
Excuse me, where did Mr. Yeon go?

594
00:45:43,115 --> 00:45:44,908
-What? I don't know.
-What?

595
00:45:44,992 --> 00:45:47,870
He was just here.
Did he go to the bathroom, maybe?

596
00:45:48,912 --> 00:45:50,289
-Find some napkins.
-Napkins?

597
00:45:50,372 --> 00:45:51,749
We have the napkins here.

598
00:45:51,832 --> 00:45:53,542
-Yes.
-Here they are.

599
00:45:53,625 --> 00:45:55,794
-Hurry and fill the glasses.
-Why are you so...

600
00:45:55,878 --> 00:45:58,005
-Let's cheer together, just us.
-Drink your own.

601
00:46:24,907 --> 00:46:26,450
It'll be raining soon.

602
00:46:29,578 --> 00:46:31,872
I wish it would just rain like crazy.

603
00:46:49,932 --> 00:46:52,643
Your body temperature's dropping.
What if you catch a cold?

604
00:46:52,726 --> 00:46:54,603
Don't worry about it. It's fine.

605
00:46:55,938 --> 00:46:59,441
If you're hurting and need
someone to talk to, you can talk to me.

606
00:47:02,611 --> 00:47:05,197
Talk about what? Who do you think you are?

607
00:47:05,280 --> 00:47:08,158
I'm a high-tech holographic AI
who is only visible to--

608
00:47:21,380 --> 00:47:23,257
-Are you okay?
-I'm fine.

609
00:47:24,466 --> 00:47:26,134
I'm fine, I'm...

610
00:48:47,633 --> 00:48:50,469
If I hadn't gotten my hopes up,
I never would've gotten hurt.

611
00:48:57,935 --> 00:49:00,938
I pretended that I was strong
and said it was easier to be alone,

612
00:49:01,438 --> 00:49:04,942
but I ended up making a big fuss
when someone was simply being nice to me.

613
00:49:05,067 --> 00:49:08,028
Gosh, it's so embarrassing.

614
00:49:08,487 --> 00:49:11,615
Jeez, I feel like such an idiot.
Seriously.

615
00:49:21,625 --> 00:49:23,210
You asked me why I didn't...

616
00:49:24,544 --> 00:49:28,131
-tell anyone about my condition, right?
-And you said...

617
00:49:29,341 --> 00:49:30,175
"no reason."

618
00:49:34,179 --> 00:49:36,264
Up until when I was in high school,

619
00:49:36,640 --> 00:49:39,226
I told people that I was close to...

620
00:49:40,936 --> 00:49:43,021
about having face blindness.

621
00:49:44,189 --> 00:49:45,816
I told my best friend

622
00:49:46,066 --> 00:49:47,567
-and my first love.
-So-yeon.

623
00:49:49,027 --> 00:49:50,946
Aren't you cold, Gang-min?

624
00:49:51,029 --> 00:49:52,531
So it really is true.

625
00:49:52,614 --> 00:49:54,992
-I guess she doesn't know.
-She must be disabled.

626
00:49:55,075 --> 00:49:55,993
Jeez.

627
00:49:59,746 --> 00:50:01,873
They switched outfits on purpose

628
00:50:02,374 --> 00:50:05,502
because they wanted to see
whether I really had facial blindness.

629
00:50:05,585 --> 00:50:06,753
Jeez.

630
00:50:06,837 --> 00:50:12,009
He was only curious about my condition
from the very start.

631
00:50:15,303 --> 00:50:17,556
I didn't tell anyone after that

632
00:50:18,015 --> 00:50:19,307
in case I'd get hurt again.

633
00:50:20,684 --> 00:50:25,147
And I just pretended it was no big deal,
saying it was for no reason.

634
00:50:33,613 --> 00:50:34,865
Let's go somewhere else

635
00:50:34,948 --> 00:50:36,575
-instead of sitting.
-Right now?

636
00:50:38,243 --> 00:50:39,745
-Where?
-To a rooftop party.

637
00:50:47,085 --> 00:50:50,589
Jeez, I was wondering
which rooftop you were talking about.

638
00:50:52,132 --> 00:50:56,178
Well, I guess this technically
is a rooftop too.

639
00:50:57,429 --> 00:50:58,346
Yeah.

640
00:51:03,643 --> 00:51:04,519
What?

641
00:51:13,612 --> 00:51:15,864
Here's a rooftop party just for you,
Miss Han.

642
00:51:20,535 --> 00:51:21,620
Wow.

643
00:51:22,996 --> 00:51:25,624
Am I really the only one who can see this?

644
00:51:33,757 --> 00:51:34,883
I can't believe this.

645
00:51:41,765 --> 00:51:42,849
That's hot!

646
00:51:46,645 --> 00:51:47,938
This is amazing.

647
00:52:04,496 --> 00:52:05,539
Let's dance.

648
00:52:05,914 --> 00:52:08,708
-What?
-People do that all the time in movies.

649
00:52:11,878 --> 00:52:13,505
We're the only ones here.

650
00:52:14,172 --> 00:52:15,048
No way.

651
00:52:19,261 --> 00:52:20,554
Seriously?

652
00:52:38,280 --> 00:52:41,199
-Come on. Are you going to sit and watch?
-Me?

653
00:52:42,534 --> 00:52:43,994
No, I'm really bad at dancing.

654
00:53:02,095 --> 00:53:03,096
One more time.

655
00:53:06,892 --> 00:53:07,726
Good!

656
00:53:08,643 --> 00:53:09,769
Kick.

657
00:53:11,980 --> 00:53:12,898
I see.

658
00:53:22,282 --> 00:53:23,533
-Spin.
-You want me to spin?

659
00:53:28,330 --> 00:53:32,584
I'll help you
so you won't be lonely anymore.

660
00:53:37,380 --> 00:53:38,632
All right.

661
00:53:39,799 --> 00:53:41,468
-You're a good dancer.
-Am I?

662
00:53:43,553 --> 00:53:45,096
I can do this.

663
00:54:36,439 --> 00:54:37,274
Hey.

664
00:54:37,691 --> 00:54:39,859
Just call me "So-yeon."

665
00:54:41,861 --> 00:54:44,322
-I can't talk so casually to my master--
-Stop.

666
00:54:44,406 --> 00:54:45,907
Friends. That's right.

667
00:54:46,199 --> 00:54:48,785
Friends call each other by name.

668
00:54:49,202 --> 00:54:50,620
-"Friends"?
-Yeah.

669
00:54:51,371 --> 00:54:53,248
You can drop the honorific, friend.

670
00:54:53,665 --> 00:54:56,626
-Okay, So-yeon.
-Gosh.

671
00:54:58,253 --> 00:54:59,421
This is great.

672
00:54:59,504 --> 00:55:01,798
It's so nice to have a person...

673
00:55:02,173 --> 00:55:04,759
I mean, to have you listening to me.
