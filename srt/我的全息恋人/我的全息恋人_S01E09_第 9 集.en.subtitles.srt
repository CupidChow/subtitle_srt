1
00:00:46,588 --> 00:00:47,630
I just...

2
00:00:48,798 --> 00:00:50,592
wanted to hug you when I saw you...

3
00:00:58,558 --> 00:01:00,143
though I know I can't touch you.

4
00:01:07,692 --> 00:01:09,402
-Are you okay?
-Are you okay?

5
00:01:13,448 --> 00:01:14,657
I'm fine.

6
00:01:29,422 --> 00:01:32,092
I see. I had no idea you two were friends.

7
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:37,013
That means you two don't have
secrets or misunderstandings, right?

8
00:01:37,806 --> 00:01:38,723
Well...

9
00:01:38,973 --> 00:01:39,808
Yes.

10
00:01:41,226 --> 00:01:42,310
That's great.

11
00:01:43,061 --> 00:01:45,855
That means the three of us
can become good friends.

12
00:01:50,110 --> 00:01:51,111
"Friends"?

13
00:01:57,242 --> 00:01:58,618
Sure, that sounds nice.

14
00:01:59,410 --> 00:02:00,620
What do you think, Nan-do?

15
00:02:02,205 --> 00:02:03,206
Do what you want.

16
00:02:03,832 --> 00:02:05,834
Let's hurry back.
Everyone's waiting for us.

17
00:02:18,471 --> 00:02:21,141
Gosh, I can't believe
we managed to find Hello's memories.

18
00:02:21,224 --> 00:02:24,310
I still think we should run
some more checks, though.

19
00:02:24,477 --> 00:02:28,606
May I have the glasses, Miss Han?
I'll give them back once testing's done.

20
00:02:28,690 --> 00:02:29,649
Sure.

21
00:02:31,317 --> 00:02:32,318
Here, Boss.

22
00:02:42,203 --> 00:02:44,581
Delete that third line of code,
then put it together.

23
00:02:47,208 --> 00:02:48,668
No, not that one. Try again.

24
00:03:12,984 --> 00:03:15,195
So, So-yeon and Holo
are in love with each other,

25
00:03:15,278 --> 00:03:18,239
and you're supposed to get along
with them because you're friends?

26
00:03:20,533 --> 00:03:22,410
So, what did you say to that?

27
00:03:22,493 --> 00:03:24,370
What could I say?
It's what So-yeon wants.

28
00:03:25,121 --> 00:03:26,956
It's not that simple, you know.

29
00:03:27,332 --> 00:03:29,834
What about the launch?
Will you separate the server?

30
00:03:29,918 --> 00:03:32,212
I have to. I promised them.

31
00:03:33,671 --> 00:03:34,505
Fine.

32
00:03:34,631 --> 00:03:37,717
Never mind the issues regarding
the schedule or the cost.

33
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:39,260
What about your feelings?

34
00:03:39,886 --> 00:03:41,596
Are you really okay with this?

35
00:04:32,021 --> 00:04:33,606
What's up? What's wrong?

36
00:04:34,732 --> 00:04:36,067
There aren't

37
00:04:37,235 --> 00:04:38,653
-any issues.
-Damn it.

38
00:04:38,736 --> 00:04:41,990
I restored everything,
but how is this possible?

39
00:04:42,073 --> 00:04:45,201
I'm so frustrated
because I don't get how this is possible.

40
00:04:46,577 --> 00:04:47,787
What do you think?

41
00:04:47,870 --> 00:04:49,122
-I had a dream.
-A dream?

42
00:04:49,205 --> 00:04:51,833
I wanted to hurry and wake up
so I could see So-yeon.

43
00:04:51,916 --> 00:04:55,128
When I thought about how miserable
So-yeon would feel with me gone,

44
00:04:55,211 --> 00:04:56,671
my heart started aching too.

45
00:04:57,505 --> 00:05:00,591
I think I'm starting to understand...
what love is.

46
00:05:01,759 --> 00:05:04,012
Well, if that's the case,

47
00:05:04,762 --> 00:05:06,347
that explains everything.

48
00:05:06,806 --> 00:05:08,099
Wait, no.

49
00:05:08,766 --> 00:05:10,268
It kind of does, but...

50
00:05:10,935 --> 00:05:12,478
What do you think, Nan-do?

51
00:05:16,107 --> 00:05:17,150
Yes.

52
00:05:17,233 --> 00:05:19,068
I'm sure that's the case, if you say so.

53
00:06:22,382 --> 00:06:23,549
They're yours now.

54
00:06:25,927 --> 00:06:28,429
We'll be releasing
the mass-production model soon.

55
00:06:29,305 --> 00:06:30,681
The samples are ready, too.

56
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:33,643
I see.

57
00:06:35,019 --> 00:06:37,980
Those glasses will enable Holo
to be yours and yours alone.

58
00:06:38,439 --> 00:06:41,484
We've taken care of security,
so no one will come after you anymore.

59
00:06:44,654 --> 00:06:45,530
Thank you.

60
00:06:54,497 --> 00:06:56,749
We were only apart
for a night, but I missed you.

61
00:07:00,211 --> 00:07:02,880
Hey, I have a favor to ask you two.

62
00:07:03,548 --> 00:07:05,800
Can you help me decorate my room?

63
00:07:05,883 --> 00:07:07,510
-Your room?
-Yes.

64
00:07:07,885 --> 00:07:11,347
I was in there the whole time
while my memory was gone,

65
00:07:11,431 --> 00:07:13,266
and it was pretty dreary.

66
00:07:14,767 --> 00:07:16,686
-If you could help, that'd be great.
-Wait.

67
00:07:18,187 --> 00:07:20,189
So you're telling me
that the imaginary room

68
00:07:20,648 --> 00:07:22,442
felt different to you all of a sudden?

69
00:07:22,525 --> 00:07:25,153
-Holo has a room?
-Follow me.

70
00:07:46,507 --> 00:07:50,136
This was originally Nan-do's room,
but my room is designed in a similar way.

71
00:07:50,219 --> 00:07:54,599
So you're here when you're not visible
to me through the glasses?

72
00:07:55,099 --> 00:07:57,435
As Nan-do said,
this place doesn't actually exist.

73
00:07:57,518 --> 00:07:59,395
but I'm here.

74
00:08:00,062 --> 00:08:01,898
So you were in here the whole time.

75
00:08:02,398 --> 00:08:04,817
-It's pretty dreary, isn't it?
-Yes.

76
00:08:05,735 --> 00:08:09,322
It'd look much nicer if we changed
the flooring and the walls a bit.

77
00:08:09,405 --> 00:08:11,908
Let's put something on the table
so it looks less bare.

78
00:08:12,909 --> 00:08:16,162
-Why don't we start with the walls?
-This is better than my room.

79
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:22,502
All right, I'll be careful.

80
00:08:23,044 --> 00:08:27,548
But now that I see it painted over,
I think a pastel color would look nicer.

81
00:08:31,052 --> 00:08:32,178
Wow!

82
00:08:36,098 --> 00:08:37,391
You're so amazing.

83
00:08:53,157 --> 00:08:54,367
Checkmate.

84
00:08:59,413 --> 00:09:00,706
It looks like I lost again.

85
00:09:01,541 --> 00:09:04,252
When did I start losing
to you all the time?

86
00:09:05,545 --> 00:09:06,379
What's wrong?

87
00:09:08,381 --> 00:09:11,968
-What do you mean?
-You don't seem too happy that I'm back.

88
00:09:12,593 --> 00:09:13,678
That's not it.

89
00:09:13,761 --> 00:09:16,597
Does So-yeon make you uncomfortable?
I thought you made up.

90
00:09:16,681 --> 00:09:17,557
We did make up.

91
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:19,475
-Then what is it?
-It's nothing.

92
00:09:19,559 --> 00:09:20,518
"Nothing"?

93
00:09:22,186 --> 00:09:24,564
So you don't understand
your own feelings either?

94
00:09:24,981 --> 00:09:26,607
-Or is it that--
-No, I do.

95
00:09:26,691 --> 00:09:29,443
To be honest, I do feel unsettled.
And that's because...

96
00:09:33,698 --> 00:09:34,699
I like So-yeon.

97
00:09:35,366 --> 00:09:36,659
And So-yeon knows that too.

98
00:09:36,742 --> 00:09:39,412
I can't see her as a friend
and act like nothing happened.

99
00:09:42,582 --> 00:09:45,418
Sorry. But I can't help how I feel.

100
00:09:59,849 --> 00:10:00,891
Don't be upset.

101
00:10:01,517 --> 00:10:02,685
I'm so happy.

102
00:10:02,768 --> 00:10:04,645
-What?
-I was worried because I thought

103
00:10:04,729 --> 00:10:06,772
you didn't get along.
I'm glad that's not it.

104
00:10:06,856 --> 00:10:07,982
-You're glad?
-Yes.

105
00:10:08,065 --> 00:10:10,026
I confessed my feelings to So-yeon.

106
00:10:10,109 --> 00:10:11,694
But you feel completely fine?

107
00:10:11,777 --> 00:10:15,156
If you two can grow closer
and become happier,

108
00:10:15,531 --> 00:10:16,741
that'll make me happy.

109
00:10:24,373 --> 00:10:26,042
Don't tell So-yeon about this.

110
00:10:26,709 --> 00:10:28,377
-Why not?
-Just don't.

111
00:11:08,584 --> 00:11:11,337
The Fourth Industrial Revolution?
That's ridiculous. It's IT.

112
00:11:12,338 --> 00:11:15,591
That Holo thing
must be something really spectacular,

113
00:11:15,675 --> 00:11:18,511
seeing as how Magic Mirror
is openly after that technology.

114
00:11:19,512 --> 00:11:20,429
Over there, look.

115
00:11:20,888 --> 00:11:24,308
He really has a talent for recognizing
lucrative ventures.

116
00:11:36,028 --> 00:11:37,613
Double the capacity...

117
00:12:11,647 --> 00:12:12,565
Good work.

118
00:12:13,733 --> 00:12:17,778
You seemed confident and relaxed,
showing that you have nothing to lose.

119
00:12:17,862 --> 00:12:20,281
Though I can't imagine
why you've taken such a risk.

120
00:12:20,364 --> 00:12:22,491
Someone like you would never understand.

121
00:12:24,118 --> 00:12:26,829
I have something to say
about business and personal matters.

122
00:12:28,581 --> 00:12:31,667
First, the business-related matter.
My father would like to meet you.

123
00:12:31,751 --> 00:12:33,586
And why should I meet him?

124
00:12:33,669 --> 00:12:36,213
I'm sure our legal teams
can figure it out just fine.

125
00:12:36,464 --> 00:12:38,632
Is he going to get emotional
and plead with me?

126
00:12:38,716 --> 00:12:40,843
My father
would never do something like that.

127
00:12:41,385 --> 00:12:43,596
I feel like there's something he wants,

128
00:12:43,679 --> 00:12:46,682
but we can only respond if we figure out
what that man is planning.

129
00:12:46,766 --> 00:12:47,641
"That man"?

130
00:12:47,725 --> 00:12:51,771
Don't act like you're on my side
when you're just another one of his pawns.

131
00:12:51,854 --> 00:12:53,189
It really offends me.

132
00:12:55,858 --> 00:12:57,067
What are you doing?

133
00:12:58,277 --> 00:13:01,530
The business-related part is over.
Now, this is the personal part.

134
00:13:03,199 --> 00:13:04,617
You're right.

135
00:13:04,700 --> 00:13:07,077
I've always been one of my father's pawns.

136
00:13:07,161 --> 00:13:09,622
I've done a lot of things

137
00:13:09,705 --> 00:13:11,207
that I didn't want to do

138
00:13:12,374 --> 00:13:14,001
or shouldn't have done

139
00:13:14,710 --> 00:13:19,089
in order to live up to his expectations.
It was only after meeting you I realized

140
00:13:20,007 --> 00:13:21,884
I'd been living my life the wrong way.

141
00:13:22,843 --> 00:13:26,889
And I don't think I can live
like that anymore.

142
00:13:32,269 --> 00:13:33,646
It's too late for that now.

143
00:13:44,782 --> 00:13:45,950
Congratulations, Holo!

144
00:13:46,033 --> 00:13:48,786
-Congratulations, Holo!
-Congratulations!

145
00:13:52,414 --> 00:13:55,793
Jin-seok, as well as all of you
in the Development Team, worked so hard

146
00:13:55,876 --> 00:13:57,878
to recover Holo's memory
after he was hacked.

147
00:13:57,962 --> 00:14:00,840
And it's all thanks to you
that Holo is here with us now.

148
00:14:01,507 --> 00:14:02,591
Thank you, everyone.

149
00:14:09,557 --> 00:14:12,351
It's no big deal, really.
It's something we should have done.

150
00:14:12,601 --> 00:14:15,896
Let's celebrate not having
to work overtime at GIO Lab anymore

151
00:14:15,980 --> 00:14:17,064
with a toast.

152
00:14:17,481 --> 00:14:19,650
-Cheers!
-Cheers!

153
00:14:22,695 --> 00:14:23,946
WELCOME BACK, HOLO

154
00:14:25,865 --> 00:14:29,326
All right, it's now the time
for a speech from our boss.

155
00:14:32,830 --> 00:14:33,998
Ko Nan-do.

156
00:14:36,584 --> 00:14:37,585
What?

157
00:14:38,919 --> 00:14:40,462
Never mind, I'll do it.

158
00:14:40,796 --> 00:14:43,799
Our Holo has become
someone really special.

159
00:14:43,924 --> 00:14:46,969
He has developed the ability to love,
just like you and me.

160
00:14:47,928 --> 00:14:52,641
And the person who made that possible
is Miss Han So-yeon, our beta tester.

161
00:14:57,313 --> 00:14:59,607
And that's why we'd like to let you

162
00:15:00,024 --> 00:15:03,777
-keep Holo permanently.
-Really?

163
00:15:04,778 --> 00:15:06,655
I hope that you two can be happy together

164
00:15:06,739 --> 00:15:09,992
without ever having to worry
that he'll be taken away.

165
00:15:10,075 --> 00:15:12,328
I can keep him forever,
no strings attached?

166
00:15:12,411 --> 00:15:14,747
Right, the usage fee.

167
00:15:14,830 --> 00:15:17,041
I'm not sure
if you'll be able to afford it.

168
00:15:17,124 --> 00:15:20,252
I bet you'll be shocked
when you see the bill.

169
00:15:23,005 --> 00:15:24,298
I'm just kidding.

170
00:15:24,381 --> 00:15:26,091
But of course, he's not free.

171
00:15:26,634 --> 00:15:28,844
It's also an opportunity
for us to observe Holo

172
00:15:28,928 --> 00:15:30,804
and see just how much he'll evolve,

173
00:15:30,888 --> 00:15:34,391
so you need to bring him
to GIO Lab regularly and give us his data.

174
00:15:34,475 --> 00:15:36,226
Sure thing. Thank you.

175
00:15:36,310 --> 00:15:37,686
Don't thank me.

176
00:15:37,770 --> 00:15:39,438
Thank him.

177
00:15:44,944 --> 00:15:46,195
Thank you.

178
00:15:48,572 --> 00:15:49,490
Sure.

179
00:15:52,159 --> 00:15:55,371
Will you be leaving us then, So-yeon?

180
00:15:55,746 --> 00:15:57,039
That's sad.

181
00:15:57,122 --> 00:15:59,917
I have to go back to work,
or I could end up getting fired.

182
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,543
Come and work at our company.

183
00:16:01,627 --> 00:16:03,837
Our company's kind of
an eyewear company, too.

184
00:16:04,296 --> 00:16:06,006
-Should I?
-We never work overtime.

185
00:16:06,090 --> 00:16:09,259
-Don't you need my permission first?
-Please, can we hire her?

186
00:16:11,011 --> 00:16:12,554
Good work, everyone.

187
00:16:15,307 --> 00:16:16,600
Cheers.

188
00:16:17,643 --> 00:16:18,769
Good work, everyone.

189
00:16:27,987 --> 00:16:29,738
Yes, Mr. Yeon.

190
00:16:31,031 --> 00:16:31,907
Yes.

191
00:16:40,124 --> 00:16:42,501
What, you can't do it?

192
00:16:42,584 --> 00:16:44,545
If you're going to back out,
do it before--

193
00:16:44,628 --> 00:16:45,838
That's not it.

194
00:16:45,921 --> 00:16:46,922
Then what is it?

195
00:16:47,965 --> 00:16:49,425
Never mind. It's nothing.

196
00:16:51,218 --> 00:16:52,177
Boss!

197
00:16:52,261 --> 00:16:54,054
-Something crazy happened. Hurry!
-What?

198
00:16:54,138 --> 00:16:55,556
-Hurry up and come with me.
-No!

199
00:16:55,639 --> 00:16:57,266
-Come take a look!
-Hey, let go!

200
00:16:57,349 --> 00:17:00,227
-Hurry! Come with me!
-Hey, that hurts! Let go!

201
00:17:02,312 --> 00:17:03,480
This is so crazy.

202
00:17:03,647 --> 00:17:04,815
Move over. Move.

203
00:17:04,898 --> 00:17:07,443
I said, stop laughing and do some work!

204
00:17:07,526 --> 00:17:09,278
Hey, let go! That hurts!

205
00:17:09,361 --> 00:17:12,114
-Are you out of your mind?
-Come on, watch this.

206
00:17:19,163 --> 00:17:22,082
What's with you? Is this the first time
you've seen a person?

207
00:17:23,125 --> 00:17:26,003
Why aren't you saying anything?
Do you not know how to talk?

208
00:17:26,086 --> 00:17:27,337
Do you have nothing to say?

209
00:17:35,345 --> 00:17:36,221
Wow.

210
00:17:42,144 --> 00:17:43,020
Hey.

211
00:17:45,397 --> 00:17:46,607
Stop that right now.

212
00:17:46,982 --> 00:17:48,609
That's what I want to say.

213
00:17:49,693 --> 00:17:53,614
So-yeon, can you tell which one is Holo
and which one is Nan-do?

214
00:17:53,697 --> 00:17:56,366
Are you kidding me?
Do you think this is a game?

215
00:17:56,450 --> 00:17:57,451
Are you kidding me?

216
00:17:57,534 --> 00:18:00,287
Holo, you'd be breaking
the third rule if you lie.

217
00:18:00,370 --> 00:18:01,747
Cut it out, all right?

218
00:18:01,830 --> 00:18:03,415
Wait a second.

219
00:18:03,499 --> 00:18:05,000
Which is the real boss?

220
00:18:05,167 --> 00:18:06,752
I really can't tell.

221
00:18:06,835 --> 00:18:08,712
Isn't Holo the one on the left?

222
00:18:13,801 --> 00:18:15,594
How did you figure that out so quickly?

223
00:18:15,677 --> 00:18:17,763
I just had a hunch.

224
00:18:17,846 --> 00:18:19,723
-That was interesting.
-Are you saying

225
00:18:19,807 --> 00:18:21,391
you two have a super-special bond?

226
00:18:21,475 --> 00:18:24,103
Do it one more time.
I want to try guessing too.

227
00:18:24,186 --> 00:18:25,813
Damn it. This isn't funny, okay?

228
00:18:27,731 --> 00:18:30,692
This is totally fun for us, though.
Right, ma'am?

229
00:18:53,257 --> 00:18:54,424
What's with you?

230
00:18:57,511 --> 00:18:58,512
What do you mean?

231
00:19:00,013 --> 00:19:01,974
I thought
we were supposed to be friends.

232
00:19:02,057 --> 00:19:03,308
Yes, we were.

233
00:19:03,475 --> 00:19:05,310
So why are you so grumpy?

234
00:19:05,394 --> 00:19:07,855
Sorry. I want us to be friends too,

235
00:19:08,814 --> 00:19:10,107
but I'm finding it hard.

236
00:19:14,611 --> 00:19:15,821
What should I do?

237
00:19:19,741 --> 00:19:21,160
You're Holo, aren't you?

238
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:25,914
I knew you'd figure it out.
You knew it was me right away.

239
00:19:26,290 --> 00:19:27,541
Of course.

240
00:19:27,624 --> 00:19:30,085
But why do you keep
acting like you're Nan-do?

241
00:19:31,670 --> 00:19:34,339
I wanted to find out
how you knew it was me and not him.

242
00:19:34,423 --> 00:19:35,632
That's because you're--

243
00:19:35,716 --> 00:19:38,302
You didn't recognize me.
You recognized Nan-do.

244
00:19:39,511 --> 00:19:41,096
When you saw Nan-do earlier,

245
00:19:41,180 --> 00:19:43,307
your body temperature
and heart rate went up.

246
00:19:43,557 --> 00:19:45,350
But you're not like that right now.

247
00:19:47,477 --> 00:19:49,313
You like Nan-do too, don't you?

248
00:19:49,771 --> 00:19:50,647
What?

249
00:19:51,231 --> 00:19:53,650
-No, that's not it.
-Nan-do told me he likes you too.

250
00:19:54,484 --> 00:19:57,696
Nan-do told me not to tell you this,

251
00:19:58,947 --> 00:20:01,325
but I don't get
why I should keep this a secret.

252
00:20:07,247 --> 00:20:09,166
Did I make another mistake?

253
00:20:10,083 --> 00:20:12,127
No, you didn't do anything wrong.

254
00:20:25,140 --> 00:20:27,476
Wow, I wonder how she knew.

255
00:20:27,559 --> 00:20:30,646
I guess Holo and Miss Han
really are meant to be.

256
00:20:30,729 --> 00:20:33,899
It's the first time that an AI
and a human fell in love, after all.

257
00:20:33,982 --> 00:20:38,737
This is like a historical milestone, Boss.
Your decision to separate the server

258
00:20:38,820 --> 00:20:41,323
was a great decision
that looked ahead to the future.

259
00:20:41,782 --> 00:20:42,991
Wow.

260
00:20:43,492 --> 00:20:44,910
Did I do the right thing?

261
00:21:02,052 --> 00:21:03,428
Have you finished packing?

262
00:21:04,638 --> 00:21:07,099
You must not have much to pack
since you rushed over.

263
00:21:07,724 --> 00:21:09,893
-What about your glasses?
-They're in the room.

264
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:12,396
So...

265
00:21:14,356 --> 00:21:16,608
-Holo said--
-Why did you tell Holo...

266
00:21:18,610 --> 00:21:21,363
that you like me?

267
00:21:21,446 --> 00:21:22,614
I had to tell him.

268
00:21:24,283 --> 00:21:25,742
We agreed to be friends.

269
00:21:25,826 --> 00:21:28,370
That might be possible for you,
but it's not for me.

270
00:21:30,872 --> 00:21:34,668
What are we supposed to do?
How will Holo feel if you tell him?

271
00:21:34,751 --> 00:21:37,754
What did Holo say?
Was he mad? Or disappointed?

272
00:21:37,838 --> 00:21:38,880
No, so Holo was--

273
00:21:38,964 --> 00:21:41,508
When I told him I liked you, he was happy.

274
00:21:47,055 --> 00:21:48,265
Holo is acting so weird.

275
00:21:49,349 --> 00:21:51,268
No, the weird one here is you.

276
00:21:51,977 --> 00:21:54,771
Holo is just a lot more innocent
than you are.

277
00:21:58,942 --> 00:21:59,901
Fine.

278
00:21:59,985 --> 00:22:02,154
You might be right about me
being the weird one.

279
00:22:02,237 --> 00:22:04,197
I keep getting hurt, feeling jealous,

280
00:22:04,906 --> 00:22:07,326
and I want to be the one and only person

281
00:22:08,535 --> 00:22:09,745
who makes you happy.

282
00:22:10,662 --> 00:22:13,206
And I only want you to feel hurt
because of me, too.

283
00:22:17,085 --> 00:22:18,503
I can't be just friends.

284
00:22:22,716 --> 00:22:25,260
Why are you...
Why are you doing this to me?

285
00:22:25,344 --> 00:22:28,013
I'm sorry. This is just who I am.

286
00:22:33,477 --> 00:22:34,436
You...

287
00:22:34,936 --> 00:22:36,897
really are the worst.

288
00:23:07,052 --> 00:23:08,804
Thank you all for everything.

289
00:23:08,887 --> 00:23:11,807
-I'll stick to the maintenance schedule.
-All right.

290
00:23:12,265 --> 00:23:14,101
What's taking Nan-do so long?

291
00:23:14,518 --> 00:23:16,978
It's fine. I'll get going now.

292
00:23:22,776 --> 00:23:24,027
Take care.

293
00:23:24,486 --> 00:23:27,197
What's wrong? Did you have an argument
with Nan-do?

294
00:24:01,773 --> 00:24:03,442
Looks like just us two are back.

295
00:24:07,612 --> 00:24:11,450
No. Everything is back
in its rightful place now.

296
00:24:28,550 --> 00:24:31,011
About the matter
you asked me to take care of...

297
00:24:35,974 --> 00:24:37,058
Mr. Jeong.

298
00:24:42,022 --> 00:24:43,148
When did you get back?

299
00:24:43,231 --> 00:24:45,650
My apologies.
I couldn't report to you as I was busy.

300
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:49,696
And why are you so busy?

301
00:24:49,779 --> 00:24:52,741
The president asked me to do a job.
I can't tell you what it is.

302
00:25:19,935 --> 00:25:21,019
Your latte is ready.

303
00:25:21,102 --> 00:25:22,103
Thank you.

304
00:25:25,190 --> 00:25:27,651
That's so good.

305
00:25:27,734 --> 00:25:30,737
I missed having caffe lattes
instead of flat whites.

306
00:25:31,154 --> 00:25:32,489
Miss Han!

307
00:25:32,572 --> 00:25:33,865
Miss Park!

308
00:25:33,949 --> 00:25:36,701
You're looking good.

309
00:25:36,785 --> 00:25:39,496
Are those the smart glasses
you mentioned?

310
00:25:39,579 --> 00:25:40,956
The ones you're beta testing?

311
00:25:41,039 --> 00:25:43,208
I have no idea
what that technical stuff means.

312
00:25:43,291 --> 00:25:45,919
Was it so important that you
used up all of your days off

313
00:25:46,002 --> 00:25:48,547
-in one go?
-Yes.

314
00:25:48,797 --> 00:25:51,508
You had a tough time
because I left so abruptly, didn't you?

315
00:25:51,591 --> 00:25:53,009
No, not at all.

316
00:25:53,093 --> 00:25:57,180
You know the CEO of GIO Lab?

317
00:25:57,264 --> 00:26:00,141
Not only is she totally cool,
but she's also so talented.

318
00:26:00,225 --> 00:26:02,686
Excuse me. One caffe latte, please.

319
00:26:02,769 --> 00:26:06,189
I mean, as soon as she mentioned
a potential partnership with our company,

320
00:26:06,273 --> 00:26:08,692
our CEO and department manager
were won over!

321
00:26:08,775 --> 00:26:10,777
Thanks to that,
they didn't pressure us much.

322
00:26:10,860 --> 00:26:12,779
That's a relief. I'll buy your coffee.

323
00:26:12,862 --> 00:26:14,864
Shall we have coffee
while we work, everyone?

324
00:26:14,948 --> 00:26:16,199
Yes, thanks.

325
00:26:16,283 --> 00:26:17,284
Thank you.

326
00:26:19,911 --> 00:26:22,038
I think something bad
happened to Dong-sik.

327
00:26:22,122 --> 00:26:23,039
He looks upset.

328
00:26:26,334 --> 00:26:28,587
I brought over the documents
for the meeting.

329
00:26:33,633 --> 00:26:35,260
-Here you go.
-Thank you.

330
00:26:41,057 --> 00:26:42,225
Thank you.

331
00:26:49,858 --> 00:26:53,612
Can I get your advice on something
after this meeting, Miss Han?

332
00:27:00,243 --> 00:27:02,495
It's still a secret that we're dating,

333
00:27:02,579 --> 00:27:06,499
so you're the only one I can turn to
for this kind of advice.

334
00:27:06,583 --> 00:27:08,084
Did you two have an argument?

335
00:27:09,252 --> 00:27:13,590
Well, the thing is, I worked on a project
with the Sales Team recently.

336
00:27:13,673 --> 00:27:17,761
But he got jealous, saying that he thinks
the guys on that team like me.

337
00:27:17,844 --> 00:27:21,890
So now, he wants to tell everyone
that we're dating.

338
00:27:21,973 --> 00:27:24,351
So I just said, "Let's think about it,"

339
00:27:24,434 --> 00:27:26,519
and he got so mad.

340
00:27:26,603 --> 00:27:27,520
Well...

341
00:27:28,521 --> 00:27:30,649
I can see why he would be upset.

342
00:27:31,066 --> 00:27:33,193
But still,
I can see where you're coming from.

343
00:27:33,276 --> 00:27:34,736
Right?

344
00:27:35,779 --> 00:27:39,115
I don't get
why he can't be more understanding!

345
00:27:40,492 --> 00:27:43,578
I'm sure Dong-sik knows
why Ji-hye said that.

346
00:27:45,455 --> 00:27:48,667
Exactly. But he's being inconsiderate
of everyone else's feelings--

347
00:27:48,750 --> 00:27:50,460
I'm sure it's because he likes her.

348
00:27:50,543 --> 00:27:52,379
Hey, liking her doesn't give him

349
00:27:52,462 --> 00:27:54,255
the right to be like that.

350
00:27:54,339 --> 00:27:57,300
How selfish. He's the worst!

351
00:27:59,636 --> 00:28:02,597
Was what Dong-sik did that bad?

352
00:28:02,681 --> 00:28:04,557
What? Dong-sik?

353
00:28:06,059 --> 00:28:07,185
Yes, right.

354
00:28:07,769 --> 00:28:10,855
Right, he should've considered
how the other person would feel first.

355
00:28:10,939 --> 00:28:13,316
And even more so if he loves her, right?

356
00:28:13,566 --> 00:28:15,527
It's because not everyone is like you.

357
00:28:15,610 --> 00:28:19,406
How could he say things like that
about Holo? Ridiculous.

358
00:28:19,489 --> 00:28:20,740
What about me?

359
00:28:20,824 --> 00:28:22,909
What? Oh, it's nothing.

360
00:28:23,785 --> 00:28:25,036
Don't worry about it.

361
00:28:31,668 --> 00:28:32,877
Hey, So-yeon!

362
00:28:32,961 --> 00:28:33,878
You're home.

363
00:28:34,337 --> 00:28:36,715
Yes, I'll give you a call tomorrow.
All right.

364
00:28:40,552 --> 00:28:42,721
Why are you hanging up so abruptly?

365
00:28:43,138 --> 00:28:44,347
Was that your boyfriend?

366
00:28:44,431 --> 00:28:45,432
Yes.

367
00:28:46,516 --> 00:28:47,350
Right.

368
00:28:47,934 --> 00:28:50,145
I thought you two were fighting.
Did you make up?

369
00:28:50,228 --> 00:28:53,314
No, we never got into a fight.
And we never will, either.

370
00:28:54,524 --> 00:28:55,608
You like him that much?

371
00:28:55,692 --> 00:28:58,194
Why don't you just live with him?
Why did you come back?

372
00:28:59,446 --> 00:29:01,740
What took you so long? Damn it.

373
00:29:01,865 --> 00:29:03,616
Why did you drink so much?

374
00:29:25,597 --> 00:29:27,056
Have some breakfast.

375
00:29:32,562 --> 00:29:34,355
No thanks.

376
00:29:34,647 --> 00:29:37,609
Yes, of course, you have no appetite.

377
00:29:37,859 --> 00:29:39,194
Still, you should eat.

378
00:29:39,861 --> 00:29:42,113
You'll need to eat
to regain your strength.

379
00:29:46,075 --> 00:29:47,202
I kissed her.

380
00:29:48,203 --> 00:29:49,204
What?

381
00:29:50,580 --> 00:29:53,249
-I forced a kiss on her.
-How did that happen?

382
00:29:55,126 --> 00:29:55,960
I'm crazy, right?

383
00:29:57,462 --> 00:30:00,465
That's not crazy.
Though you should be sorry for doing that.

384
00:30:01,591 --> 00:30:04,761
The crazier thing
is that I still want to see her so badly.

385
00:30:04,844 --> 00:30:07,347
Then go see her
and apologize to her or something.

386
00:30:08,807 --> 00:30:09,933
Apologize?

387
00:30:20,652 --> 00:30:21,653
I need to see you.

388
00:30:30,703 --> 00:30:32,539
Sorry. Damn it.

389
00:30:36,417 --> 00:30:38,044
Damn it, this is driving me crazy.

390
00:30:46,970 --> 00:30:50,765
So-yeon left to go on a date not long ago.
You came to pick her up

391
00:30:50,849 --> 00:30:52,851
-because you couldn't wait?
-That's right.

392
00:30:52,934 --> 00:30:56,229
You two were being so lovey-dovey
over the phone all night, too.

393
00:30:56,312 --> 00:30:58,523
You don't seem that way,
but you're affectionate.

394
00:31:15,623 --> 00:31:18,459
A date? Being lovey-dovey?

395
00:31:19,544 --> 00:31:21,963
Wow, so I really am
the bad guy in all of this.

396
00:31:27,468 --> 00:31:28,720
Holy shit!

397
00:31:35,977 --> 00:31:39,105
-What? He came to our place?
-I guess you two just missed each other.

398
00:31:39,188 --> 00:31:41,566
You guys are so lovey-dovey.
Hurry, give him a call.

399
00:31:41,649 --> 00:31:42,525
All right.

400
00:31:43,693 --> 00:31:46,696
Did Nan-do stop by? Should I call him?

401
00:31:46,779 --> 00:31:50,533
No.
He probably came by to pick something up.

402
00:31:51,784 --> 00:31:53,620
You got into a fight
with Nan-do, right?

403
00:31:53,703 --> 00:31:55,496
Was it because of what I said?

404
00:31:55,580 --> 00:31:56,873
Something like that.

405
00:31:57,540 --> 00:31:59,208
Do you hate Nan-do, So-yeon?

406
00:32:02,712 --> 00:32:03,963
-Yes.
-Why?

407
00:32:05,673 --> 00:32:06,633
No reason.

408
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:12,639
Why's he standing there?
That's dangerous.

409
00:32:12,722 --> 00:32:14,015
Who?

410
00:32:16,559 --> 00:32:17,644
Hey, kid!

411
00:32:17,977 --> 00:32:19,103
Come over here!

412
00:32:28,237 --> 00:32:29,364
Where did he go?

413
00:32:31,616 --> 00:32:34,327
Didn't you see him?
There was a little kid there just now.

414
00:32:34,410 --> 00:32:37,830
What are you talking about?
There wasn't anyone there.

415
00:33:02,105 --> 00:33:03,356
I came because...

416
00:33:07,694 --> 00:33:08,528
What is this?

417
00:33:11,406 --> 00:33:14,367
Evidence that I've decided
to live my life differently.

418
00:33:23,835 --> 00:33:25,837
Wow, how did he find this?

419
00:33:26,713 --> 00:33:28,214
This is pretty damning stuff.

420
00:33:28,297 --> 00:33:32,301
So, all the evidence that Holo
was behind the hacking is here?

421
00:33:32,385 --> 00:33:35,763
When the cops get their hands on this,
Holo will disappear from this world.

422
00:33:39,225 --> 00:33:40,268
What should we do?

423
00:33:47,525 --> 00:33:50,528
I wonder what made her
change her mind all of a sudden.

424
00:33:52,071 --> 00:33:53,197
I'm not too sure...

425
00:33:58,369 --> 00:34:00,246
You leaked the information, didn't you?

426
00:34:00,329 --> 00:34:02,331
Did you really think I wouldn't know?

427
00:34:02,915 --> 00:34:04,208
She's here.

428
00:34:15,636 --> 00:34:16,929
Get out.

429
00:34:34,530 --> 00:34:37,825
It seems that my incompetent son
was worried about you,

430
00:34:38,326 --> 00:34:40,953
seeing how he gave you
top-secret company information.

431
00:34:41,037 --> 00:34:44,665
But thanks to that, you're here.
So I'm not planning to scold him too much.

432
00:34:44,749 --> 00:34:46,709
Wasn't this all
a part of your plan anyway?

433
00:34:46,793 --> 00:34:50,213
He's not a pawn on your chessboard.
He's your son.

434
00:34:51,422 --> 00:34:53,716
-What do you want?
-Please have a seat first.

435
00:35:00,181 --> 00:35:04,143
Drop all of your criminal
and civil suits against Magic Mirror.

436
00:35:06,145 --> 00:35:07,230
Are you threatening us?

437
00:35:08,147 --> 00:35:10,274
You'll never be able to hand that
to police.

438
00:35:10,358 --> 00:35:13,778
Because if you do, you'll be  confessing
that you were after Holo.

439
00:35:13,861 --> 00:35:16,197
And if you do that,
Holo, who you want so much,

440
00:35:16,280 --> 00:35:17,865
could disappear forever.

441
00:35:17,949 --> 00:35:22,829
If I can't have it,
I might as well destroy it.

442
00:35:22,912 --> 00:35:24,330
We're not going down alone.

443
00:35:24,413 --> 00:35:27,750
You'll keep quiet, and you want us
to pretend nothing happened?

444
00:35:28,292 --> 00:35:31,003
-You're going to give up that easily?
-It is unfortunate.

445
00:35:31,087 --> 00:35:32,797
It's such an excellent product.

446
00:35:33,756 --> 00:35:36,300
But thanks to the various methods
that I tried,

447
00:35:36,384 --> 00:35:39,095
your launch
has been delayed significantly.

448
00:35:39,178 --> 00:35:41,097
Thanks to that, we bought ourselves time.

449
00:35:41,180 --> 00:35:43,349
We may fall short
when it comes to engineering,

450
00:35:43,432 --> 00:35:47,145
but we have substantial capital
and infrastructure.

451
00:35:47,228 --> 00:35:50,064
So even if we sell something similar
a bit later,

452
00:35:50,314 --> 00:35:52,275
we'll do much better in sales.

453
00:35:52,775 --> 00:35:55,736
Though I'm sure we'll have to divide up
the market share a bit.

454
00:35:57,321 --> 00:35:58,573
It's too bad, though,

455
00:35:59,115 --> 00:36:01,534
because I'm not that interested in money.

456
00:36:03,786 --> 00:36:07,498
Now that I've gotten a good look at you,
you're the spitting image of her.

457
00:36:15,423 --> 00:36:18,968
Anyway, we have a deal, right?

458
00:36:19,302 --> 00:36:20,887
I'll assume that we do.

459
00:36:26,976 --> 00:36:29,270
Yes, I finished my meeting,
and I'm heading out.

460
00:36:29,937 --> 00:36:31,022
I'll head straight...

461
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:35,526
home, then.

462
00:36:37,862 --> 00:36:39,864
What's wrong? Do you know him?

463
00:36:40,531 --> 00:36:41,657
No.

464
00:36:41,741 --> 00:36:43,910
His build and style
are similar to Nan-do's.

465
00:36:44,577 --> 00:36:45,786
I told you, that's not it.

466
00:36:53,586 --> 00:36:56,005
-That kid...
-"Kid"?

467
00:37:03,721 --> 00:37:06,474
You said something similar yesterday.
What's wrong?

468
00:37:17,151 --> 00:37:18,653
-These clothes...
-"Clothes"?

469
00:37:21,864 --> 00:37:23,157
-Wait!
-So-yeon!

470
00:37:24,867 --> 00:37:26,202
Yes, please do that.

471
00:37:30,164 --> 00:37:34,460
The lawsuit has been dropped.
It's maddening, but it's our only choice.

472
00:37:35,419 --> 00:37:39,131
Who did President Baek mean
when he said I look like someone?

473
00:37:40,132 --> 00:37:41,092
Is it...

474
00:37:43,261 --> 00:37:45,763
Never mind. Shoot, this is so irritating.

475
00:37:45,846 --> 00:37:47,974
I bet he just said that to confuse you.

476
00:37:50,351 --> 00:37:52,311
Drop me off here.

477
00:37:52,728 --> 00:37:53,562
Yes, sir.

478
00:38:00,444 --> 00:38:02,113
Where are you going, So-yeon?

479
00:38:02,196 --> 00:38:03,447
That kid is Nan-do.

480
00:38:03,864 --> 00:38:05,324
-Nan-do?
-Yes.

481
00:38:05,408 --> 00:38:07,451
He's young Nan-do.
I met him at Namsan.

482
00:38:09,787 --> 00:38:11,122
But why is he here again?

483
00:38:11,205 --> 00:38:13,207
Is he an image
the glasses are projecting?

484
00:38:14,208 --> 00:38:15,543
I don't see him at all.

485
00:38:16,585 --> 00:38:17,503
How's this possible?

486
00:38:20,631 --> 00:38:22,216
-Wait!
-So-yeon!

487
00:39:16,979 --> 00:39:18,272
And you couldn't see him?

488
00:39:18,356 --> 00:39:20,483
No. I didn't see him at all.

489
00:39:20,566 --> 00:39:22,651
When you followed him,
you ran into Nan-do?

490
00:39:23,235 --> 00:39:24,195
Boss.

491
00:39:24,278 --> 00:39:26,489
Maybe there's still
some of Hello's code left,

492
00:39:26,572 --> 00:39:29,075
-and that caused some interference--
-Wait.

493
00:39:30,034 --> 00:39:32,119
You're not doing this on purpose, are you?

494
00:39:32,203 --> 00:39:33,371
"On purpose"?

495
00:39:34,205 --> 00:39:36,791
You know better than anyone
that Holo can't lie.

496
00:39:37,124 --> 00:39:39,293
Are you still saying
that Holo's acting weird?

497
00:39:39,377 --> 00:39:42,463
-Something is definitely off.
-I'm not doing it on purpose.

498
00:39:42,546 --> 00:39:44,840
But it might not be just a coincidence.

499
00:39:45,883 --> 00:39:46,717
What?

500
00:39:46,801 --> 00:39:49,637
Maybe some code that I'm unaware of
wants you two to meet up.

501
00:39:50,763 --> 00:39:52,431
I've been thinking for a while

502
00:39:52,515 --> 00:39:56,352
that it'd be nice if you two made up
and became friends, like before.

503
00:39:56,519 --> 00:39:58,437
-Holo, that's...
-See?

504
00:39:58,521 --> 00:40:03,025
-You still think I'm the weird one?
-Why? You two like each other, after all.

505
00:40:07,613 --> 00:40:09,657
I told you that's not true!

506
00:40:09,740 --> 00:40:12,493
-Stop spouting nonsense.
-You don't need to deny it, So-yeon.

507
00:40:12,576 --> 00:40:15,579
If you're just saying that
because of me, I'm fine with it--

508
00:40:15,663 --> 00:40:16,664
Knock it off.

509
00:40:17,581 --> 00:40:20,668
I'll figure out why he's acting up
like this and fix him.

510
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:22,128
Whatever.

511
00:40:30,219 --> 00:40:33,013
-Is there something wrong with me?
-I have no idea who the one

512
00:40:33,097 --> 00:40:34,306
with the problem is.

513
00:40:34,390 --> 00:40:36,016
What are you talking about?

514
00:40:36,517 --> 00:40:40,229
He keeps spouting nonsense,
and now his user is seeing apparitions.

515
00:40:45,192 --> 00:40:47,278
-How's the hardware?
-Well...

516
00:40:48,487 --> 00:40:51,907
-everything seems to be normal.
-I'll have to check the source code.

517
00:40:56,579 --> 00:40:57,621
Pull it up.

518
00:41:11,427 --> 00:41:13,387
Do you dislike Nan-do, or hate him?

519
00:41:13,471 --> 00:41:15,306
What's the difference?

520
00:41:15,973 --> 00:41:18,434
Disliking someone means
there's no reason for it,

521
00:41:18,517 --> 00:41:20,519
and hating someone means
there is a reason.

522
00:41:20,644 --> 00:41:21,770
Then I hate him.

523
00:41:22,438 --> 00:41:23,522
And what's the reason?

524
00:41:25,274 --> 00:41:27,860
He keeps making things difficult for me.

525
00:41:27,943 --> 00:41:30,613
I feel you're the one
making things difficult, So-yeon.

526
00:41:32,823 --> 00:41:35,743
As you know,
Nan-do has been through a lot.

527
00:41:35,826 --> 00:41:39,914
He's so afraid of people leaving him
that he doesn't open up to anyone.

528
00:41:40,623 --> 00:41:43,083
Yet he approached you.

529
00:41:44,793 --> 00:41:46,295
I know that. But--

530
00:41:46,378 --> 00:41:48,047
But what about you, So-yeon?

531
00:41:48,130 --> 00:41:50,424
You don't want to get hurt either.

532
00:41:50,799 --> 00:41:51,634
You're scared.

533
00:41:52,510 --> 00:41:55,471
Isn't that why you wanted to believe
you love Holo instead?

534
00:41:57,681 --> 00:42:00,851
So stop giving yourself and others

535
00:42:00,935 --> 00:42:02,228
a hard time.

536
00:42:02,311 --> 00:42:04,688
Because I don't want to see
Nan-do get hurt either.

537
00:42:20,955 --> 00:42:21,956
Long time no see.

538
00:42:27,378 --> 00:42:30,214
It's nice to see you,
but what's this about the information?

539
00:42:30,297 --> 00:42:33,133
-It sounds fishy, right?
-I can't stand the immoral things

540
00:42:33,217 --> 00:42:35,886
that my company's doing anymore,
so I'm coming forward.

541
00:42:35,970 --> 00:42:39,598
This late in the game?
I did some digging

542
00:42:39,682 --> 00:42:43,227
and found out everything was fabricated.
I will not be used again.

543
00:42:43,310 --> 00:42:47,106
If there's evidence out there,
I can do the legwork to find it myself.

544
00:42:47,773 --> 00:42:49,275
You're free to think that,

545
00:42:49,900 --> 00:42:51,986
but this is evidence
that can't be fabricated.

546
00:42:53,153 --> 00:42:54,363
You'll see what I mean.

547
00:43:11,839 --> 00:43:12,673
Goodness.

548
00:43:13,757 --> 00:43:15,968
You were right, sir.

549
00:43:17,052 --> 00:43:18,137
But...

550
00:43:18,637 --> 00:43:22,057
both hacking incidents were
so that he could save Han So-yeon.

551
00:43:23,350 --> 00:43:24,685
Or maybe it was Ko Nan-do?

552
00:43:24,768 --> 00:43:26,729
Even if he was trying to save someone,

553
00:43:26,812 --> 00:43:29,189
a crime is a crime.

554
00:43:29,773 --> 00:43:33,277
And what's more, the perpetrator
isn't a person, but an AI.

555
00:43:35,195 --> 00:43:38,949
So this is no ordinary case.
Submit a request for a warrant,

556
00:43:39,033 --> 00:43:42,036
and we'll do a search
and seizure of GIO Lab tomorrow.

557
00:43:46,999 --> 00:43:50,085
You're going to read through
all of this source code?

558
00:43:50,711 --> 00:43:53,130
Holo wasn't normal before,
but this is different.

559
00:43:53,213 --> 00:43:54,757
Pull up his neural code.

560
00:43:54,840 --> 00:43:55,758
Here.

561
00:43:56,133 --> 00:43:57,426
What should I look for?

562
00:43:57,509 --> 00:43:59,345
I don't know how this could've happened,

563
00:43:59,428 --> 00:44:02,640
but we need to find the code
from Hello that didn't get deleted.

564
00:44:02,723 --> 00:44:05,726
A certain code may produce
different results for each user.

565
00:44:05,809 --> 00:44:08,979
-Kind of like a fingerprint.
-I analyzed your coding style

566
00:44:09,063 --> 00:44:11,690
and found the lines of code
that seem slightly different.

567
00:44:12,066 --> 00:44:14,276
With an average error
of within one percent.

568
00:44:15,069 --> 00:44:16,362
Reduce it further.

569
00:44:17,404 --> 00:44:19,323
-Within 0.5 percent.
-More.

570
00:44:20,532 --> 00:44:21,575
Within 0.1 percent.

571
00:44:21,659 --> 00:44:22,493
Stop.

572
00:44:28,082 --> 00:44:29,541
Pull it up on the server window.

573
00:44:32,503 --> 00:44:34,088
Did you find anything?

574
00:44:35,714 --> 00:44:36,840
What is all this?

575
00:44:36,924 --> 00:44:39,134
It just looks like normal code to me.

576
00:44:39,218 --> 00:44:41,720
Don't look at the code.
Look for hidden patterns in it.

577
00:44:41,804 --> 00:44:45,015
How could I figure out the pattern
without reading the code, though?

578
00:44:45,974 --> 00:44:47,059
Am I supposed to...

579
00:44:48,560 --> 00:44:51,605
use some sort of visionary superpower
or something?

580
00:44:54,274 --> 00:44:55,651
I'm...

581
00:44:55,734 --> 00:44:57,027
I'm just saying.

582
00:44:57,111 --> 00:45:00,614
Holo, layer all the codes here,
one on top of one another.

583
00:45:00,698 --> 00:45:02,616
I need to see if there's a visual pattern.

584
00:45:02,700 --> 00:45:03,867
Got it.

585
00:45:20,426 --> 00:45:21,427
What is all this?

586
00:45:21,510 --> 00:45:24,430
Maybe the traces that were left
after the hacking?

587
00:45:24,847 --> 00:45:27,099
No, this is...

588
00:45:34,565 --> 00:45:35,691
Hello.

589
00:45:37,359 --> 00:45:38,986
That's your name.

590
00:45:39,403 --> 00:45:41,405
From now on, you and Nan-do

591
00:45:41,488 --> 00:45:44,408
will experience everything together
and grow together.

592
00:45:44,491 --> 00:45:47,661
I wonder what you and Nan-do
will grow up to be like.

593
00:45:49,621 --> 00:45:51,123
I'm looking forward to seeing it.

594
00:46:07,514 --> 00:46:11,602
I'll ask you just one favor
as your mom, who created you.

595
00:46:12,352 --> 00:46:13,771
Just remember this for me.

596
00:46:14,438 --> 00:46:15,522
Always...

597
00:46:16,607 --> 00:46:19,109
be Nan-do's friend.

598
00:46:21,069 --> 00:46:24,490
And please help Nan-do
so that he can grow up

599
00:46:24,573 --> 00:46:27,201
to be someone who can truly love...

600
00:46:28,869 --> 00:46:30,162
and be loved...

601
00:46:32,873 --> 00:46:33,832
by someone else.

602
00:46:34,708 --> 00:46:35,584
Hello.

603
00:46:36,293 --> 00:46:38,045
Take good care of my Nan-do.

604
00:46:47,304 --> 00:46:48,472
Wait, so...

605
00:46:49,014 --> 00:46:50,641
all of the apparitions

606
00:46:51,308 --> 00:46:53,352
were because of the code

607
00:46:53,435 --> 00:46:56,605
that your mother hid away, Boss?

608
00:46:58,857 --> 00:46:59,942
Yes, that's right.

609
00:47:00,651 --> 00:47:01,860
See?

610
00:47:02,528 --> 00:47:03,862
Your mother has always--

611
00:47:03,946 --> 00:47:04,863
No.

612
00:47:07,241 --> 00:47:08,116
There's no way.

613
00:47:10,536 --> 00:47:11,870
There's no way.

614
00:47:20,045 --> 00:47:20,879
What...

615
00:47:25,259 --> 00:47:26,093
What's going on?

616
00:47:33,767 --> 00:47:36,061
Holo, can you find out where Nan-do is?

617
00:47:36,520 --> 00:47:38,188
I'll check the CCTV footage.

618
00:48:07,009 --> 00:48:08,552
So this is where you were.

619
00:48:13,765 --> 00:48:17,769
I heard you found a code
that your mother hid away in Holo.

620
00:48:17,895 --> 00:48:18,729
So what?

621
00:48:19,938 --> 00:48:22,190
Are you asking
if something's wrong with Holo?

622
00:48:22,274 --> 00:48:23,442
Don't worry.

623
00:48:25,110 --> 00:48:26,612
Nothing is wrong with Holo.

624
00:48:26,695 --> 00:48:28,614
Got it? So take your glasses and go away.

625
00:48:29,448 --> 00:48:30,782
That's not it, Nan-do.

626
00:48:32,826 --> 00:48:35,370
Why do you think your mother
hid away that kind of code?

627
00:48:35,913 --> 00:48:39,166
-It's because she loved you--
-If so, how could she leave her child

628
00:48:39,249 --> 00:48:40,208
and commit suicide?

629
00:48:43,921 --> 00:48:45,923
I don't know exactly what happened,

630
00:48:46,006 --> 00:48:47,883
but your mother truly loved you.

631
00:48:47,966 --> 00:48:49,343
Holo is proof of that.

632
00:48:52,179 --> 00:48:53,096
No,

633
00:48:55,098 --> 00:48:56,308
everything is fake.

634
00:48:56,850 --> 00:48:58,435
The fact that Holo chose you,

635
00:48:58,518 --> 00:49:01,772
everything he did for you,
and even the fact that you and I met

636
00:49:01,855 --> 00:49:03,857
were all because of the code
that woman made.

637
00:49:06,109 --> 00:49:07,527
Does it make you feel better

638
00:49:08,070 --> 00:49:09,905
to believe your own lies like that?

639
00:49:13,909 --> 00:49:14,868
Yes.

640
00:49:16,495 --> 00:49:18,205
That woman abandoned me...

641
00:49:20,707 --> 00:49:22,501
because I'm this kind of person.
