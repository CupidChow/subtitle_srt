1
00:00:43,460 --> 00:00:45,462
The sales of HoloGlass,
augmented-reality

2
00:00:45,545 --> 00:00:47,422
holographic glasses with AI technology,

3
00:00:47,505 --> 00:00:50,842
have skyrocketed since its launch
by Magic Mirror a month ago.

4
00:00:50,925 --> 00:00:52,260
It's easy to spot people

5
00:00:52,343 --> 00:00:55,472
-wearing HoloGlass recently.
-Holo, I'm off to a meeting...

6
00:00:55,555 --> 00:00:56,931
So-called "Holo Syndrome"

7
00:00:57,015 --> 00:00:59,726
has been receiving mixed responses
and reviews.

8
00:00:59,809 --> 00:01:01,978
I think it'll look better on you.
Go ahead. See?

9
00:01:02,062 --> 00:01:04,898
Red looks good on you.
Can you zoom in a bit?

10
00:01:04,981 --> 00:01:07,025
Holo, show me how adorable you can be.

11
00:01:08,651 --> 00:01:09,694
Gosh.

12
00:01:09,778 --> 00:01:10,945
Holo's a pain in the ass.

13
00:01:11,029 --> 00:01:13,573
No one's buying ordinary glasses anymore
because of Holo.

14
00:01:13,656 --> 00:01:17,077
The boss wants us to come up
with an advertisement draft that...

15
00:01:24,459 --> 00:01:26,336
Take those off while you're at work.

16
00:01:26,419 --> 00:01:28,004
Can't you do your job without them?

17
00:01:29,089 --> 00:01:30,715
-Sure.
-Got it.

18
00:01:31,299 --> 00:01:32,717
Unbelievable.

19
00:01:39,682 --> 00:01:42,227
Holo, what's next on my schedule?

20
00:01:56,032 --> 00:01:57,325
What's going on?

21
00:01:57,408 --> 00:01:58,910
I think those two broke up.

22
00:01:58,993 --> 00:02:02,622
Holo is a much better partner
than a boyfriend you always bicker with.

23
00:02:02,914 --> 00:02:05,041
Anyway,
why haven't you been wearing yours?

24
00:02:06,668 --> 00:02:07,710
No reason.

25
00:02:08,837 --> 00:02:10,839
My goodness, where did you learn

26
00:02:10,964 --> 00:02:12,423
-to say that?
-Yoo-ram?

27
00:02:12,507 --> 00:02:14,259
You're a player, aren't you?

28
00:02:14,342 --> 00:02:15,176
Yoo-ram!

29
00:02:18,596 --> 00:02:19,556
Oh, you're home.

30
00:02:19,639 --> 00:02:22,100
-Were you talking on the phone just now?
-Oh, right.

31
00:02:22,183 --> 00:02:24,227
It's not like you to be home at this hour.

32
00:02:24,310 --> 00:02:25,895
What's there to do outside?

33
00:02:25,979 --> 00:02:28,898
You spend money, exhaust yourself,
and drink until you're tired.

34
00:02:28,982 --> 00:02:32,110
I'm looking forward
to lounging around this weekend,

35
00:02:32,193 --> 00:02:33,403
so remember that.

36
00:02:33,486 --> 00:02:36,406
-Don't you have a flight?
-I was reprimanded for something,

37
00:02:37,073 --> 00:02:38,491
but it's for the best.

38
00:02:38,575 --> 00:02:41,244
I'll take some time off
and think about my life.

39
00:02:41,327 --> 00:02:42,453
What's this?

40
00:02:45,081 --> 00:02:49,085
I bought a pair too since everyone's
been talking about it, and it's not bad.

41
00:02:49,169 --> 00:02:51,546
I made my Holo look like my ideal man

42
00:02:51,629 --> 00:02:55,091
and gave him a muscular figure
by buying a few features.

43
00:02:56,342 --> 00:02:57,343
Want to see him?

44
00:02:57,427 --> 00:02:59,762
Whatever.
Was this why you were reprimanded?

45
00:02:59,846 --> 00:03:02,015
You were caught wearing this
on a flight?

46
00:03:02,974 --> 00:03:04,767
Gosh, get a grip on yourself, idiot.

47
00:03:04,851 --> 00:03:06,936
Why? You wore it to work too.

48
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:08,146
-Why can't I?
-Yoo-ram.

49
00:03:08,229 --> 00:03:09,355
Give me that.

50
00:03:16,237 --> 00:03:19,324
On a lonely day

51
00:03:20,366 --> 00:03:24,370
On a day we long for a friend

52
00:03:25,121 --> 00:03:28,333
We make one

53
00:03:28,791 --> 00:03:32,295
That is cute and fascinating

54
00:03:34,881 --> 00:03:39,552
That nobody else knows about

55
00:03:41,012 --> 00:03:42,472
Aren't I a decent dancer?

56
00:03:43,681 --> 00:03:45,516
-Like this?
-My friend

57
00:03:48,436 --> 00:03:49,604
Like this?

58
00:03:58,321 --> 00:03:59,614
I miss him.

59
00:04:17,298 --> 00:04:19,550
Millions are logged on to the Holo server.

60
00:04:20,426 --> 00:04:22,679
Shouldn't he be located by now?

61
00:04:22,929 --> 00:04:24,973
Since he's the creator of Holo,

62
00:04:25,056 --> 00:04:27,850
he must know
how to avoid being detected by him.

63
00:04:27,934 --> 00:04:29,644
Ko Nan-do is an uncertain factor

64
00:04:29,727 --> 00:04:31,938
and must be eliminated
as soon as possible.

65
00:04:32,855 --> 00:04:34,899
The intelligence agency meeting
is coming up,

66
00:04:34,983 --> 00:04:37,193
and I don't want to worry about him

67
00:04:37,485 --> 00:04:39,862
when I'm about to make
the biggest deal of my life.

68
00:04:40,321 --> 00:04:41,239
Yes, sir.

69
00:05:07,223 --> 00:05:08,474
Miss Ko,

70
00:05:09,017 --> 00:05:12,729
why must we meet with Baek Chan-sung?

71
00:05:12,937 --> 00:05:16,190
He's worth trusting, that's why.
He's the one who chose this place.

72
00:05:16,274 --> 00:05:18,818
What? But why is this place--

73
00:05:18,901 --> 00:05:21,446
Because no one is wearing
HoloGlass here.

74
00:05:24,073 --> 00:05:27,535
My father's monitoring people
through Holo even as we speak

75
00:05:27,618 --> 00:05:28,828
from every single aspect.

76
00:05:28,911 --> 00:05:30,371
So that's it.

77
00:05:30,455 --> 00:05:32,623
It's why he wanted Holo
for himself so badly.

78
00:05:33,666 --> 00:05:35,043
Have you located Mr. Ko?

79
00:05:36,836 --> 00:05:37,837
Not yet.

80
00:05:39,130 --> 00:05:41,716
My father
is frantically searching for him too.

81
00:05:43,426 --> 00:05:44,385
That's why...

82
00:05:44,969 --> 00:05:47,847
I'm thinking of meeting Detective Nam
of the IT Division.

83
00:05:48,306 --> 00:05:51,017
Didn't he close his investigation
on your father's orders?

84
00:05:51,100 --> 00:05:53,394
Detective Nam
wanted to continue the investigation.

85
00:05:53,478 --> 00:05:55,188
His bosses forced him to close it.

86
00:05:58,524 --> 00:06:00,985
The intelligence agency meeting
is happening soon,

87
00:06:01,069 --> 00:06:03,154
and I don't want to worry about him

88
00:06:03,363 --> 00:06:06,407
when I'm about to make
the biggest deal of my life.

89
00:06:09,577 --> 00:06:13,289
It's pretty obvious why he's meeting
with an intelligence agency in secret.

90
00:06:14,332 --> 00:06:15,666
The coding installed in Holo.

91
00:06:15,750 --> 00:06:19,545
He wants to sell the government
the power to monitor the public.

92
00:06:20,546 --> 00:06:21,881
I get all that,

93
00:06:22,382 --> 00:06:24,842
-but why did you bring this to me?
-What?

94
00:06:26,010 --> 00:06:29,555
-How can you say that after--
-Sorry, but I don't trust either of you.

95
00:06:30,306 --> 00:06:33,351
Besides, this recording
is your only evidence.

96
00:06:33,434 --> 00:06:36,354
-Then we'll find more proof--
-We'll talk more when you do.

97
00:06:37,605 --> 00:06:40,566
Although, that might change
if President Baek

98
00:06:40,650 --> 00:06:43,069
locates Ko Nan-do first
and does something crazy.

99
00:06:43,152 --> 00:06:44,737
What did you just say?

100
00:06:47,281 --> 00:06:49,617
I guess we shouldn't have come to you.

101
00:06:50,660 --> 00:06:51,661
Let's go.

102
00:07:02,004 --> 00:07:05,550
-Things seem to be going as you predicted.
-What's that you're chewing?

103
00:07:08,344 --> 00:07:10,346
Nicotine gum. You won't let me smoke.

104
00:07:10,847 --> 00:07:13,057
Are you just going to watch
from the sidelines?

105
00:07:13,141 --> 00:07:15,601
That's not what cops are paid to do.

106
00:07:15,893 --> 00:07:18,729
This investigation
needs to be off-the-books.

107
00:07:19,230 --> 00:07:21,274
I can't protect you if things go wrong.

108
00:07:21,357 --> 00:07:24,402
I don't regret joining the force
through my connections with you.

109
00:07:25,987 --> 00:07:29,532
So how did those two
end up on the same side?

110
00:07:29,615 --> 00:07:31,826
-Wasn't it obvious?
-Not to me.

111
00:07:31,909 --> 00:07:33,703
You really should get out more.

112
00:07:33,786 --> 00:07:36,664
I am out, here, with you.

113
00:07:48,092 --> 00:07:49,010
But nothing more.

114
00:07:49,093 --> 00:07:52,847
IT PROVIDES A BETTER LOOK
INTO THE WORLD BUT NOTHING MORE

115
00:08:00,771 --> 00:08:01,939
People...

116
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:07,403
It allows you to see people.

117
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:20,041
The one you wish to see...

118
00:08:24,420 --> 00:08:25,922
Bastard...

119
00:08:43,856 --> 00:08:44,982
Why won't it work?

120
00:09:01,666 --> 00:09:06,045
I'm sorry. Still, we're friends.

121
00:09:07,088 --> 00:09:08,214
Forever.

122
00:09:13,177 --> 00:09:15,054
RESTRICTED NUMBER

123
00:09:20,309 --> 00:09:22,728
Don't tell me you threw away the glasses.

124
00:09:23,771 --> 00:09:24,814
Ko Nan-do?

125
00:09:27,858 --> 00:09:29,944
The world will be in an uproar soon.

126
00:09:30,486 --> 00:09:33,489
When that time comes,
Holo will return to you.

127
00:09:33,948 --> 00:09:36,075
What do you mean by that?
Where are you?

128
00:09:37,118 --> 00:09:38,119
I'm sorry.

129
00:11:27,978 --> 00:11:29,313
You're low on battery.

130
00:11:29,689 --> 00:11:31,399
Please recharge in the sun.

131
00:11:51,460 --> 00:11:52,670
What do you think?

132
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:58,426
It automatically reads faces
and checks one's personal information,

133
00:11:58,509 --> 00:12:00,428
profession, and criminal record--

134
00:12:02,012 --> 00:12:05,266
Thank you for having used Holo so far.

135
00:12:05,474 --> 00:12:09,186
Please contact President Baek Nam-gyu
of Magic Mirror for any inquiries.

136
00:12:09,270 --> 00:12:10,938
He will answer sincerely.

137
00:12:11,021 --> 00:12:12,773
-His phone number is...
-What the hell?

138
00:12:12,857 --> 00:12:17,903
...zero, one, four, one, four, seven,
zero, seven, seven, six...

139
00:12:29,915 --> 00:12:32,084
What's with everyone?

140
00:12:44,096 --> 00:12:45,723
Look, guys!

141
00:12:52,688 --> 00:12:53,689
What's going on?

142
00:12:54,398 --> 00:12:56,984
-Holo is being erased due to a hack.
-Put a stop to it!

143
00:13:08,078 --> 00:13:08,954
Did you hear?

144
00:13:12,291 --> 00:13:15,836
Nan-do, what the hell did you do?

145
00:13:27,473 --> 00:13:29,058
What the heck?

146
00:13:30,559 --> 00:13:32,394
-Where did it go?
-Holo?

147
00:13:32,478 --> 00:13:33,312
Holo?

148
00:13:34,522 --> 00:13:35,481
What's wrong with it?

149
00:13:36,106 --> 00:13:38,400
-Has yours gone offline as well?
-Yes.

150
00:13:38,484 --> 00:13:40,820
-Mine's not working either.
-Jeez.

151
00:13:51,580 --> 00:13:55,459
-It's been a while.
-This will make you a criminal for real.

152
00:13:56,627 --> 00:13:57,670
I already am one.

153
00:14:01,674 --> 00:14:02,925
-Holo?
-What's up with Holo?

154
00:14:03,342 --> 00:14:04,593
Is this malfunctioning?

155
00:14:04,677 --> 00:14:06,887
-Why won't it work?
-It won't come online.

156
00:14:06,971 --> 00:14:08,305
-Why not?
-I can't see Holo.

157
00:14:08,973 --> 00:14:10,683
I can't believe it's malfunctioning.

158
00:14:10,766 --> 00:14:12,017
Was the program hacked?

159
00:14:12,101 --> 00:14:13,894
-I need to get it fixed.
-Gosh.

160
00:14:13,978 --> 00:14:15,437
-Why isn't this working?
-What...

161
00:14:15,521 --> 00:14:16,939
It's not working, is it?

162
00:14:17,022 --> 00:14:18,399
Why isn't it working?

163
00:14:18,524 --> 00:14:21,735
-This is so annoying.
-What do I do?

164
00:14:21,819 --> 00:14:24,405
-Shouldn't they give our money back?
-I need it for work.

165
00:14:24,488 --> 00:14:25,906
-Come on.
-Why isn't it working?

166
00:14:57,813 --> 00:14:58,898
Why did you do this?

167
00:14:58,981 --> 00:15:00,316
I did what was needed.

168
00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:02,610
The new server isn't as grand,

169
00:15:03,694 --> 00:15:06,780
but it'll be enough
to accommodate So-yeon's glasses.

170
00:15:06,864 --> 00:15:09,283
-Make sure you aren't traced.
-What about you?

171
00:15:09,366 --> 00:15:10,951
I'm going to disappear.

172
00:15:14,622 --> 00:15:16,540
-What about So-yeon?
-Don't tell her.

173
00:15:16,624 --> 00:15:18,250
You know I can't lie.

174
00:15:18,667 --> 00:15:21,754
You don't have to.
It'll be all over the news anyway.

175
00:15:21,837 --> 00:15:24,882
-That's all you should believe.
-Will we ever see each other again?

176
00:15:28,552 --> 00:15:30,679
-Don't know.
-Won't you be lonely?

177
00:15:30,763 --> 00:15:32,640
I'm fine, so look after So-yeon.

178
00:15:34,141 --> 00:15:38,270
You must protect her no matter what.
I'm asking you this as a friend.

179
00:15:45,069 --> 00:15:46,737
Nan-do. I...

180
00:15:53,327 --> 00:15:55,371
-Breaking news.
-The augmented-reality glasses

181
00:15:55,454 --> 00:15:58,582
-infused with AI technology...
-Holo, AR program infused with AI...

182
00:15:58,666 --> 00:16:01,001
-...was hacked.
-Its service was shut down...

183
00:16:01,085 --> 00:16:04,088
-The original creator...
-Ko Nan-do has become the prime suspect...

184
00:16:04,171 --> 00:16:06,006
Police put out an all-points bulletin.

185
00:16:09,301 --> 00:16:12,554
Did you collude
with the suspect in advance?

186
00:16:13,347 --> 00:16:15,057
Where is Ko Nan-do?

187
00:16:15,307 --> 00:16:19,853
If you don't answer me,
I'll add charges of aiding and abetting!

188
00:16:43,669 --> 00:16:48,090
-Why aren't they saying anything?
-It doesn't seem like she wants to answer.

189
00:16:50,050 --> 00:16:53,178
-What are you doing?
-This is a non-smoking zone, right?

190
00:16:53,595 --> 00:16:56,015
The lack of sleep
must be messing with my head.

191
00:16:58,726 --> 00:16:59,643
Why, you...

192
00:16:59,727 --> 00:17:01,145
Tell me everything.

193
00:17:01,228 --> 00:17:04,356
If I had known in advance,
I wouldn't have come to you for help.

194
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:07,192
Was Ko Nan-do aware
of President Baek's plan?

195
00:17:09,153 --> 00:17:11,113
What's his motive, then?

196
00:17:11,822 --> 00:17:12,656
I'm not sure.

197
00:17:12,740 --> 00:17:15,951
I have a hunch,
but there's no way for me to prove it.

198
00:17:17,870 --> 00:17:20,497
Please relay this message
if you hear from him.

199
00:17:20,581 --> 00:17:22,458
I'll be the one arresting him,

200
00:17:22,541 --> 00:17:25,461
so he had better not get caught
by President Baek.

201
00:17:42,436 --> 00:17:43,312
So-yeon!

202
00:17:44,563 --> 00:17:45,814
Are you all right?

203
00:17:45,898 --> 00:17:48,150
Forget about me.
Nan-do did something terrible.

204
00:17:49,401 --> 00:17:52,529
-I know. Do you know where he is?
-He's going to disappear.

205
00:17:53,197 --> 00:17:55,657
He told me to protect you
instead of looking for him.

206
00:17:55,741 --> 00:17:59,328
I'll find him, then.
You stay by my side and protect me.

207
00:18:03,874 --> 00:18:05,125
MISS KO

208
00:18:10,005 --> 00:18:11,090
You heard, right?

209
00:18:11,173 --> 00:18:12,925
-Yes.
-Has he contacted you?

210
00:18:16,678 --> 00:18:18,263
What about the glasses?

211
00:18:18,347 --> 00:18:21,934
-I haven't worn them in a while.
-Oh, I see.

212
00:18:22,351 --> 00:18:24,520
Please let me know if Nan-do calls.

213
00:18:24,603 --> 00:18:25,604
Sure.

214
00:18:28,315 --> 00:18:31,276
I'm sorry for not being of any help.

215
00:18:33,487 --> 00:18:34,363
Right.

216
00:18:38,492 --> 00:18:39,660
We should go.

217
00:19:03,809 --> 00:19:06,979
Vice President Baek met with Han So-yeon
with Ko Yoo-jin.

218
00:19:07,062 --> 00:19:08,063
It doesn't seem like

219
00:19:08,147 --> 00:19:11,358
either of them are aware
of Ko Nan-do's whereabouts.

220
00:19:11,441 --> 00:19:14,319
Keep watching them.
Also, keep an eye on Chan-sung.

221
00:19:14,403 --> 00:19:15,404
Yes, sir.

222
00:19:17,447 --> 00:19:18,532
Holo is back.

223
00:19:18,949 --> 00:19:22,202
Nan-do said he was going to disappear,
but I'll find him.

224
00:19:22,286 --> 00:19:24,621
We're being watched,
so I'll explain later.

225
00:19:27,416 --> 00:19:28,500
We have a tail.

226
00:19:32,546 --> 00:19:35,799
Holo must've figured out the situation
and warned So-yeon.

227
00:19:35,883 --> 00:19:38,385
Nan-do revived Holo
and sent him to So-yeon.

228
00:19:38,468 --> 00:19:42,389
Then does Miss Han know
where your brother is?

229
00:19:44,099 --> 00:19:45,726
She'll tell me when she does.

230
00:19:45,809 --> 00:19:48,812
My father wasn't able to find him,
and he had eyes everywhere.

231
00:19:48,896 --> 00:19:50,647
Holo is with her,

232
00:19:52,149 --> 00:19:53,775
so we should trust her.

233
00:19:57,237 --> 00:20:00,365
-Do you know where Nan-do could be?
-This could put you in danger.

234
00:20:00,449 --> 00:20:02,492
It's all right.
Where did you last see him?

235
00:20:02,576 --> 00:20:05,662
You can't make a move
until we find a way to ditch your tail.

236
00:20:07,748 --> 00:20:10,000
So-yeon!

237
00:20:10,834 --> 00:20:12,377
Did you watch the news?

238
00:20:13,378 --> 00:20:17,799
Ko Nan-do, the initial creator of Holo
has become a prime suspect

239
00:20:17,883 --> 00:20:19,885
and is being hunted by the police.

240
00:20:26,266 --> 00:20:29,811
-Han So-yeon left her residence.
-What about her glasses?

241
00:20:30,354 --> 00:20:31,438
She has them on.

242
00:20:31,521 --> 00:20:32,522
-Follow her.
-Sure.

243
00:20:32,606 --> 00:20:34,566
Hello, ma'am. Where to?

244
00:20:35,984 --> 00:20:39,321
I'd like to get some fresh air.
How far can you take me?

245
00:21:03,095 --> 00:21:04,805
Head to the alley down there.

246
00:21:12,020 --> 00:21:14,773
Why didn't Nan-do tell me back then?

247
00:21:14,856 --> 00:21:16,942
He probably didn't want to burden
anyone else.

248
00:21:17,025 --> 00:21:18,527
It's how he was 12 years ago

249
00:21:18,610 --> 00:21:20,487
when I committed a cyberattack.

250
00:21:20,821 --> 00:21:21,905
A cyberattack? You?

251
00:21:21,989 --> 00:21:23,865
When we were in New Zealand,

252
00:21:23,949 --> 00:21:26,576
I hacked into
Korea's government computer network.

253
00:21:26,868 --> 00:21:27,703
Why?

254
00:21:27,786 --> 00:21:29,329
Now that I think about it,

255
00:21:30,372 --> 00:21:33,125
I think it was
to find out about Nan-do's mom.

256
00:21:33,583 --> 00:21:35,544
She was my creator, after all,

257
00:21:36,586 --> 00:21:41,466
and I must've wanted to know
if she had really abandoned Nan-do.

258
00:21:42,217 --> 00:21:43,844
So? What happened?

259
00:21:43,927 --> 00:21:46,054
Even Interpol got involved,

260
00:21:46,138 --> 00:21:48,598
so Nan-do made it look like he did it

261
00:21:49,057 --> 00:21:51,768
and used my footage to fake his own death.

262
00:21:52,394 --> 00:21:55,772
He did it to save his one and only friend.

263
00:21:56,523 --> 00:21:58,025
From that moment on,

264
00:21:58,108 --> 00:22:00,485
he's been living his life as a ghost.

265
00:22:00,861 --> 00:22:03,822
That's his intention this time.
He's doing it to protect us.

266
00:22:04,865 --> 00:22:07,367
Nan-do always believes

267
00:22:08,201 --> 00:22:10,704
that it's easier to sacrifice himself.

268
00:22:13,457 --> 00:22:14,708
Let's find him fast.

269
00:22:40,859 --> 00:22:42,569
Is this where he's been staying?

270
00:22:46,990 --> 00:22:48,158
Where did he go?

271
00:22:48,658 --> 00:22:51,078
I looked into
all the nearby security cameras,

272
00:22:51,161 --> 00:22:52,662
but I couldn't find him.

273
00:22:52,788 --> 00:22:55,874
How can he not have been caught on one
when there are so many?

274
00:22:55,957 --> 00:22:59,378
It's not that he wasn't caught on one.
Even if he was, I can't find him.

275
00:22:59,544 --> 00:23:01,963
He knows the holes
in the system that well.

276
00:23:02,381 --> 00:23:05,133
Can you show it to me too?
The footage, I mean.

277
00:23:15,685 --> 00:23:18,021
This is Nan-do leaving here.

278
00:23:24,236 --> 00:23:26,405
This is the last time
he was caught on camera.

279
00:23:32,077 --> 00:23:35,247
From there, I checked
all the cameras that he could've passed,

280
00:23:36,331 --> 00:23:39,167
but I got nothing.
He must've switched clothes

281
00:23:39,668 --> 00:23:41,169
and covered his face.

282
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:44,673
I've been living with face blindness,
remember?

283
00:23:45,090 --> 00:23:45,924
It's fine.

284
00:24:04,776 --> 00:24:06,653
Him. Follow this man.

285
00:24:06,736 --> 00:24:09,739
He is of similar height and build,
but it's not enough to--

286
00:24:09,823 --> 00:24:11,533
No, I'm certain that it's him.

287
00:24:14,161 --> 00:24:15,203
How can you be?

288
00:24:15,620 --> 00:24:16,538
I just can.

289
00:24:18,206 --> 00:24:19,583
My mom once said

290
00:24:20,041 --> 00:24:22,002
that she can even recognize me
from behind.

291
00:24:39,519 --> 00:24:40,437
We found him.

292
00:25:33,782 --> 00:25:36,117
-Have you found anything?
-No, just as we expected.

293
00:25:36,535 --> 00:25:38,662
Keep looking
and see if anything stands out.

294
00:25:39,037 --> 00:25:40,997
Is it a good idea
to sit and wait, though?

295
00:25:41,957 --> 00:25:44,751
-What if we're wrong?
-His face is too well-known

296
00:25:44,834 --> 00:25:47,337
for him to stay hidden in Korea.

297
00:25:47,837 --> 00:25:49,631
He'll show up at the airport.

298
00:25:49,714 --> 00:25:52,008
He won't be able to leave the country.

299
00:25:52,092 --> 00:25:55,345
Altering his passport information
is a piece of cake for him.

300
00:25:57,138 --> 00:25:59,307
Don't rely on the database to catch him.

301
00:25:59,391 --> 00:26:02,394
You should look closely
and do some legwork.

302
00:26:03,395 --> 00:26:05,772
So my trip over here wasn't in vain.

303
00:26:08,441 --> 00:26:11,027
President Baek sent me
to help you with the investigation.

304
00:26:11,403 --> 00:26:16,741
If you didn't receive
the commissioner's call, I can put him on.

305
00:26:16,825 --> 00:26:17,993
It's all right.

306
00:26:18,577 --> 00:26:20,245
Just don't get in my way.

307
00:26:25,667 --> 00:26:27,252
KOREA AIRPORTS CORPORATION

308
00:26:30,338 --> 00:26:32,507
-Detective Nam!
-What about the reinforcements?

309
00:26:32,591 --> 00:26:33,633
They're outside.

310
00:26:33,717 --> 00:26:35,260
Okay, come with me.

311
00:27:08,585 --> 00:27:11,129
SECURITY
RESTRICTED AREA

312
00:27:25,769 --> 00:27:27,228
What are you doing there?

313
00:27:30,065 --> 00:27:32,776
I'm here to inspect
the malfunctioning security devices.

314
00:27:33,401 --> 00:27:34,527
Step aside.

315
00:27:37,489 --> 00:27:38,615
It's not working.

316
00:27:38,698 --> 00:27:40,784
It needs replacing.
I'll report it upstairs.

317
00:27:41,451 --> 00:27:45,830
Hold on.
I don't think I've seen you around.

318
00:27:46,331 --> 00:27:48,875
-Wait, are you perhaps--
-I'll be right back.

319
00:27:50,043 --> 00:27:51,461
Wait, hold on.

320
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:52,962
Police!

321
00:27:53,880 --> 00:27:56,007
That man seems suspicious.

322
00:27:56,091 --> 00:27:57,926
Sir, please stop!

323
00:28:06,518 --> 00:28:07,769
Get him!

324
00:28:08,728 --> 00:28:09,813
He's over there!

325
00:28:09,896 --> 00:28:12,816
Suspect spotted.
He's headed to the east departure area.

326
00:28:13,191 --> 00:28:16,361
Go to the east departure area.
Surround him so that he can't get away.

327
00:28:19,030 --> 00:28:20,657
-Shit.
-Get him!

328
00:28:26,162 --> 00:28:27,163
Get him!

329
00:28:28,665 --> 00:28:30,625
-Stop him!
-Ko Nan-do!

330
00:28:30,917 --> 00:28:31,960
You little...

331
00:28:40,009 --> 00:28:42,387
Ko Nan-do, calm down, all right?

332
00:28:48,059 --> 00:28:49,436
Shit.

333
00:28:53,815 --> 00:28:55,066
-Hey!
-Run!

334
00:29:05,910 --> 00:29:07,871
Suspect headed
to the basement parking lot.

335
00:29:16,921 --> 00:29:20,341
What's taking you so long?
Crash a car into him if you must!

336
00:29:24,095 --> 00:29:26,014
-Get him!
-Come on, get him.

337
00:29:28,266 --> 00:29:29,642
After him!

338
00:29:36,733 --> 00:29:37,567
Fuck!

339
00:29:42,363 --> 00:29:45,492
-Keep going! We're about to lose him.
-Hey, get over here!

340
00:29:48,870 --> 00:29:51,498
Han So-yeon! Why are you here?

341
00:29:58,546 --> 00:30:00,006
He must've hidden somewhere.

342
00:30:00,089 --> 00:30:02,091
Then find him!

343
00:30:02,675 --> 00:30:05,011
Look through
the parking lot security footage.

344
00:30:06,346 --> 00:30:07,639
Over there.

345
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:10,391
Go to Area B. Run!

346
00:30:11,559 --> 00:30:13,061
Area B, get there first.

347
00:30:13,144 --> 00:30:14,062
Area B!

348
00:30:14,145 --> 00:30:15,230
He's in Area B!

349
00:30:15,313 --> 00:30:16,481
Get him!

350
00:30:20,902 --> 00:30:22,028
I don't think so.

351
00:30:23,279 --> 00:30:25,031
He definitely came this way.

352
00:30:38,294 --> 00:30:39,295
He's not here.

353
00:30:40,588 --> 00:30:42,799
-He definitely went that way.
-I don't see him.

354
00:30:44,968 --> 00:30:46,511
Where the hell did he go?

355
00:30:54,394 --> 00:30:55,603
Good job, Holo.

356
00:30:56,771 --> 00:31:00,108
That was quite a sprint I did
within the security cameras.

357
00:31:01,860 --> 00:31:03,069
How are things back there?

358
00:31:04,445 --> 00:31:07,156
So-yeon,
you're putting yourself in danger.

359
00:31:07,699 --> 00:31:10,994
Stay there until I say
that it's safe to come out.

360
00:31:13,204 --> 00:31:14,747
Just stay put.

361
00:31:14,873 --> 00:31:15,707
Damn it.

362
00:31:20,879 --> 00:31:21,754
It was Holo.

363
00:31:22,463 --> 00:31:26,175
Are you saying that the AI hologram helped
Ko Nan-do escape by impersonating him?

364
00:31:26,259 --> 00:31:27,760
How is that possible?

365
00:31:27,844 --> 00:31:31,389
They already did it once 12 years ago.
Why would it be impossible now?

366
00:31:33,266 --> 00:31:35,476
Please grab the handrail
and stay behind...

367
00:31:36,227 --> 00:31:38,354
Didn't Ko Nan-do
delete all versions of Holo?

368
00:31:38,438 --> 00:31:43,192
Yes, but he then restored
the original Holo.

369
00:31:43,276 --> 00:31:45,236
Could he have known of our plan?

370
00:31:45,904 --> 00:31:49,616
He lets his emotions dictate his thoughts,
just like his mother.

371
00:31:51,159 --> 00:31:52,327
Anyway, find him fast.

372
00:31:52,493 --> 00:31:56,623
He's not worthy enough
to own a program like Holo.

373
00:31:57,498 --> 00:31:59,792
Ko Nan-do, prime suspect
in the Holo cyberattack,

374
00:31:59,876 --> 00:32:02,462
was caught trying to flee
through Incheon Airport,

375
00:32:02,545 --> 00:32:04,005
but he was able to escape.

376
00:32:04,088 --> 00:32:07,884
The police are searching
for the accomplice that helped him escape.

377
00:32:14,223 --> 00:32:15,558
The accomplice...

378
00:32:17,101 --> 00:32:19,103
-It's me, right?
-Why did you show up there?

379
00:32:19,187 --> 00:32:21,564
If it weren't for me and Holo,
you'd've been caught.

380
00:32:21,648 --> 00:32:24,901
Holo, this is why I told you
not to come looking for me.

381
00:32:24,984 --> 00:32:26,194
Don't be angry at him.

382
00:32:27,862 --> 00:32:29,489
Please don't argue.

383
00:32:29,572 --> 00:32:32,533
You should've stopped her
from going through with this crazy idea.

384
00:32:32,617 --> 00:32:34,494
Crazy?

385
00:32:35,787 --> 00:32:38,206
So-yeon, Nan-do didn't realize

386
00:32:38,289 --> 00:32:40,375
that you'd go this far to help him.

387
00:32:42,001 --> 00:32:43,544
That doesn't seem to be it.

388
00:32:43,628 --> 00:32:46,547
So-yeon knows how you feel,
but she's still upset.

389
00:32:46,631 --> 00:32:49,968
Seriously?
Are you our interpreter or something?

390
00:32:50,051 --> 00:32:51,135
Interpreter?

391
00:32:55,139 --> 00:32:55,974
Interpreter...

392
00:33:00,436 --> 00:33:02,438
An interpreter? That's hilarious.

393
00:33:03,022 --> 00:33:05,441
Do we know anything more
about the suspect Ko Nan-do?

394
00:33:06,317 --> 00:33:09,821
When he was around seven years old,
his birth mother committed suicide,

395
00:33:09,904 --> 00:33:12,073
and he was adopted
by a Korean family abroad.

396
00:33:12,156 --> 00:33:15,034
He showed talents
in coding and hacking as a child

397
00:33:15,118 --> 00:33:18,329
and later on founded GIO Lab
under his sister's name.

398
00:33:23,710 --> 00:33:24,794
Where are we?

399
00:33:25,545 --> 00:33:27,797
We can't be on the run
on an empty stomach.

400
00:33:27,880 --> 00:33:28,715
Mom!

401
00:33:33,511 --> 00:33:35,138
JEONG-SIM'S DINER

402
00:33:43,896 --> 00:33:44,981
It's been a while.

403
00:33:45,565 --> 00:33:46,691
I'm glad you came.

404
00:33:49,277 --> 00:33:51,821
Come on. Let's go inside.

405
00:33:58,286 --> 00:34:01,205
You used to eat a lot,
so why are you barely eating today?

406
00:34:01,831 --> 00:34:04,584
Is it not seasoned properly?

407
00:34:06,127 --> 00:34:08,129
It's fine. Everything's delicious.

408
00:34:10,715 --> 00:34:14,427
Who knew that the little boy next door
would grow up into such a decent man?

409
00:34:14,510 --> 00:34:17,472
I knew I recognized you from somewhere.

410
00:34:17,764 --> 00:34:21,017
You've always had a sharp eye for things.

411
00:34:23,853 --> 00:34:29,108
You suddenly disappeared,
and I thought there must've been a reason.

412
00:34:29,984 --> 00:34:31,819
You must have suffered so much.

413
00:34:36,657 --> 00:34:39,243
I'm sorry. I put So-yeon in danger.

414
00:34:39,327 --> 00:34:42,038
No, it's fine.

415
00:34:42,622 --> 00:34:44,499
I may not know what's going on,

416
00:34:44,582 --> 00:34:47,668
but experience has taught me
how to figure people out.

417
00:34:47,752 --> 00:34:50,171
You're not one to do anything
without reason.

418
00:34:50,254 --> 00:34:52,965
I'm sure the truth
will come out in the end.

419
00:34:54,467 --> 00:34:56,385
I'll get you some water. Eat up.

420
00:35:03,684 --> 00:35:05,603
We can't stay here for too long.

421
00:35:06,854 --> 00:35:10,441
I know. We'll head back to your hideout
and think of options.

422
00:35:11,109 --> 00:35:13,111
Just eat more while you can, all right?

423
00:35:13,736 --> 00:35:15,404
I'll help my mom for a bit.

424
00:35:37,426 --> 00:35:38,427
Ko Nan-do!

425
00:35:42,974 --> 00:35:46,018
Where do you think
you're going without me?

426
00:35:50,523 --> 00:35:51,941
I have something to do.

427
00:35:52,733 --> 00:35:54,527
-Don't go.
-Listen carefully.

428
00:35:54,610 --> 00:35:56,445
You pitied your childhood friend so much

429
00:35:56,529 --> 00:35:59,615
that you tried to help,
but I took you as a hostage instead.

430
00:35:59,699 --> 00:36:00,533
Got it?

431
00:36:00,616 --> 00:36:03,327
That's how you'll answer
if the police question you.

432
00:36:04,328 --> 00:36:08,249
"Ko Nan-do is a cold-blooded jerk
who takes friends as hostages.

433
00:36:08,666 --> 00:36:12,003
He's a selfish and dangerous prick."

434
00:36:14,130 --> 00:36:15,339
Is that good enough?

435
00:36:17,008 --> 00:36:17,925
Yes.

436
00:36:20,178 --> 00:36:22,180
-I won't.
-This is the only way.

437
00:36:22,263 --> 00:36:24,932
I'll confess to hacking the server
and deleting the Holos.

438
00:36:25,016 --> 00:36:26,934
Unless they don't know
about the original--

439
00:36:27,018 --> 00:36:29,562
Why are you making it your mission
to sacrifice yourself?

440
00:36:30,229 --> 00:36:34,025
Once you're branded a criminal and psycho
who takes friends as hostages,

441
00:36:34,108 --> 00:36:35,902
what about people that care about you?

442
00:36:38,571 --> 00:36:42,575
Do you still believe
that no one in this world loves you?

443
00:36:45,119 --> 00:36:46,871
What about Miss Ko?

444
00:36:48,372 --> 00:36:49,332
What about Holo?

445
00:36:53,794 --> 00:36:54,754
What about me?

446
00:37:00,176 --> 00:37:01,510
It's still the only way.

447
00:37:03,638 --> 00:37:05,014
This is to protect you.

448
00:37:08,851 --> 00:37:10,478
If you truly care about me,

449
00:37:11,896 --> 00:37:13,856
don't do anything else

450
00:37:15,149 --> 00:37:16,525
and just stay with me.

451
00:37:43,219 --> 00:37:45,263
I'm glad he wasn't captured, though.

452
00:37:47,098 --> 00:37:49,600
So-yeon's the best, isn't she?

453
00:37:51,560 --> 00:37:54,272
-Are you all right?
-How can I not be

454
00:37:54,355 --> 00:37:55,648
when Nan-do got away safely?

455
00:37:58,442 --> 00:37:59,610
It's just that...

456
00:38:00,111 --> 00:38:00,945
Yoo-jin.

457
00:38:02,530 --> 00:38:04,156
Can we talk later?

458
00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:05,992
I want to be alone right now.

459
00:38:09,829 --> 00:38:11,539
But I don't want to leave you alone.

460
00:38:28,097 --> 00:38:31,142
Yes, Mom. We're here together.

461
00:38:34,979 --> 00:38:36,814
All right. Don't worry.

462
00:38:37,273 --> 00:38:38,899
I'll call tomorrow as well.

463
00:38:40,276 --> 00:38:41,444
Sure.

464
00:38:47,575 --> 00:38:51,287
There's something I want to look into.
Can you leave the glasses here?

465
00:38:52,455 --> 00:38:53,831
-Here?
-Yes.

466
00:38:54,665 --> 00:38:55,499
Thanks.

467
00:38:55,583 --> 00:38:57,835
I'm the one who should thank you. Always.

468
00:39:31,535 --> 00:39:32,578
Where's Holo?

469
00:39:32,787 --> 00:39:35,039
He wanted to connect
directly to the server.

470
00:39:37,666 --> 00:39:39,043
You should get some rest.

471
00:39:39,126 --> 00:39:42,046
It's actually comfortable here.
Tell me if you need anything.

472
00:39:42,129 --> 00:39:45,132
-What about you?
-I'll sleep downstairs or in the car.

473
00:39:45,508 --> 00:39:47,259
But that'll be uncomfortable.

474
00:39:47,510 --> 00:39:49,220
You should just sleep next to me.

475
00:39:49,303 --> 00:39:50,388
What?

476
00:41:24,148 --> 00:41:26,150
For the first time in my life,

477
00:41:27,109 --> 00:41:32,531
I learned how happy but burdening it is
to have someone beside you.

478
00:41:42,291 --> 00:41:43,667
I didn't doze off.

479
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:47,213
Would you like some coffee?

480
00:41:48,255 --> 00:41:51,467
I'm fine, so go home and get some sleep.

481
00:41:51,550 --> 00:41:53,344
Will Ko Nan-do really contact us?

482
00:41:53,427 --> 00:41:55,179
He has no other choice.

483
00:41:55,262 --> 00:41:59,141
If the original Holo still exists
and it went to Han So-yeon,

484
00:42:00,142 --> 00:42:03,187
-he'll protect them both.
-I never considered him the selfless type.

485
00:42:05,105 --> 00:42:06,899
He's the type that does mislead people.

486
00:42:07,650 --> 00:42:12,112
I wouldn't be sure if he were alone,
but now that Han So-yeon is in danger too,

487
00:42:13,072 --> 00:42:13,989
he'll call.

488
00:42:16,325 --> 00:42:17,535
INCOMING CALL

489
00:42:21,497 --> 00:42:23,374
-Detective Nam?
-Ko Nan-do?

490
00:42:24,416 --> 00:42:25,793
I'd like to meet.

491
00:42:50,776 --> 00:42:52,611
Yes, I'm here.

492
00:42:52,695 --> 00:42:54,697
Will you be all right on your own?

493
00:42:54,780 --> 00:42:56,448
Report any police activity

494
00:42:56,532 --> 00:43:00,119
and don't answer any calls
unless they're from me.

495
00:43:01,495 --> 00:43:02,329
Sure.

496
00:44:03,098 --> 00:44:05,059
Welcome, Detective Nam.

497
00:44:05,893 --> 00:44:08,187
It's the first time
we're talking like this, right?

498
00:44:17,112 --> 00:44:18,572
Was it you who called?

499
00:44:18,656 --> 00:44:20,199
The other two don't know.

500
00:44:21,241 --> 00:44:22,993
They're still sleeping upstairs.

501
00:44:23,077 --> 00:44:25,162
So you made this decision by yourself?

502
00:44:25,245 --> 00:44:26,789
-Yes.
-How can you trust me?

503
00:44:26,872 --> 00:44:28,707
I might arrest the both of them.

504
00:44:28,791 --> 00:44:31,043
I know that you wouldn't do so.

505
00:44:31,126 --> 00:44:33,212
It depends on why you called me here.

506
00:44:33,295 --> 00:44:37,257
Give me to President Baek.
I'll negotiate the rest.

507
00:44:37,883 --> 00:44:40,636
So you'll sacrifice yourself
to save those two?

508
00:44:40,719 --> 00:44:42,471
It's me who President Baek wants.

509
00:44:42,721 --> 00:44:45,224
Just promise me
that you'll keep them safe.

510
00:44:45,891 --> 00:44:49,269
I'm asking you
since I can't trust President Baek.

511
00:44:49,353 --> 00:44:50,521
That I can't do.

512
00:44:51,814 --> 00:44:52,898
Why not?

513
00:44:52,981 --> 00:44:54,566
President Baek has been

514
00:44:54,650 --> 00:44:57,820
illegally monitoring people
with the Holo technology.

515
00:44:57,903 --> 00:45:00,948
The project was brought to a halt
thanks to Nan-do's cyberattack,

516
00:45:01,031 --> 00:45:04,535
but he'll restart it
once you're in his hands.

517
00:45:09,540 --> 00:45:10,708
Calm down.

518
00:45:13,836 --> 00:45:15,087
Give me the glasses.

519
00:45:21,760 --> 00:45:23,137
Nan-do!

520
00:45:25,139 --> 00:45:26,265
What?

521
00:45:26,348 --> 00:45:27,433
Don't move!

522
00:45:32,521 --> 00:45:33,814
Shit!

523
00:45:34,231 --> 00:45:35,607
I didn't call them,

524
00:45:35,691 --> 00:45:38,318
but the police got wind of it somehow.

525
00:45:38,402 --> 00:45:41,405
President Baek's people
are probably here as well.

526
00:45:41,905 --> 00:45:44,032
It's up to you to believe me or not,

527
00:45:44,116 --> 00:45:45,993
but this is your only chance
to get out.

528
00:45:49,413 --> 00:45:52,416
-Why are you letting me go?
-Ask Holo for the details.

529
00:45:52,499 --> 00:45:55,377
Only you and Holo
can stop President Baek right now.

530
00:45:56,545 --> 00:46:00,591
I'll follow and buy you time,
so don't get caught.

531
00:46:28,494 --> 00:46:29,369
Shit.

532
00:46:30,954 --> 00:46:32,247
Hey, over there!

533
00:46:33,290 --> 00:46:34,833
-There they are!
-Get him!

534
00:46:35,417 --> 00:46:37,419
-Come on!
-This is Unit Three.

535
00:46:37,503 --> 00:46:39,046
We have found the suspect.

536
00:46:45,594 --> 00:46:47,679
Nan-do, Holo's telling us to go this way.

537
00:47:19,878 --> 00:47:20,838
Look over there!

538
00:47:20,921 --> 00:47:21,922
Got it.

539
00:47:23,882 --> 00:47:26,677
-You guys should look over there.
-Yes, sir.

540
00:47:26,760 --> 00:47:28,846
-I'll go this way.
-Yes, sir.

541
00:47:28,929 --> 00:47:30,097
This way.

542
00:47:59,877 --> 00:48:01,211
Are you all right?

543
00:48:04,006 --> 00:48:05,215
Yes, we should go.

544
00:48:10,929 --> 00:48:13,390
So-yeon? So-yeon, what's wrong?

545
00:48:13,599 --> 00:48:15,559
My head. It hurts too much.

546
00:48:18,061 --> 00:48:19,730
Nan-do...

547
00:48:24,651 --> 00:48:25,986
I think they went that way!

548
00:48:30,741 --> 00:48:31,867
Can you move?

549
00:48:36,079 --> 00:48:36,955
You should go.

550
00:48:37,039 --> 00:48:38,457
No, we'll stay together.

551
00:48:38,624 --> 00:48:40,375
Hurry! You can't get caught.

552
00:48:47,341 --> 00:48:48,216
Darn.

553
00:48:49,092 --> 00:48:51,970
I'll make sure that Miss Han stays safe.

554
00:48:52,721 --> 00:48:53,931
You should go.

555
00:48:57,309 --> 00:48:59,019
I'll come back for you soon.

556
00:49:08,820 --> 00:49:10,906
-Search over there!
-Got it.

557
00:49:15,327 --> 00:49:16,328
Are you all right?

558
00:49:18,914 --> 00:49:20,248
-I found them!
-Where?

559
00:49:20,332 --> 00:49:21,375
Over here!

560
00:49:35,263 --> 00:49:36,431
Where's Ko Nan-do?

561
00:49:36,556 --> 00:49:39,685
He ran off just now
and left his hostage behind.

562
00:49:40,352 --> 00:49:42,145
He couldn't have gone far.

563
00:49:42,229 --> 00:49:45,148
I'm taking the hostage for questioning.

564
00:49:46,733 --> 00:49:47,734
Let's go.

565
00:49:51,405 --> 00:49:53,532
Yes, Miss Han is...

566
00:49:56,451 --> 00:49:58,912
What is this? Let go of me.

567
00:49:59,538 --> 00:50:01,164
-Get her.
-Let go of me!

568
00:50:07,587 --> 00:50:09,256
The president is on his way.

569
00:50:29,609 --> 00:50:33,321
I didn't think
I'd be back here at this age.

570
00:51:01,516 --> 00:51:02,559
You...

571
00:51:03,393 --> 00:51:05,270
didn't see my face today.
