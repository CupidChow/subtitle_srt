00:00:42,459 --> 00:00:45,086
EMERGENCY DISPATCH

2
00:00:47,797 --> 00:00:48,673
So-yeon.

3
00:00:48,757 --> 00:00:50,800
-Gosh. Are you all right?
-Gang-woo.

4
00:00:50,884 --> 00:00:51,760
Yes, I'm fine.

5
00:00:51,843 --> 00:00:53,303
Holo, it was you, wasn't it?

6
00:00:53,386 --> 00:00:54,971
-I don't know.
-You don't know?

7
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:58,558
People won't sit by and watch you do this.

8
00:00:58,641 --> 00:01:00,518
-So-yeon needs me.
-Shut it!

9
00:01:00,602 --> 00:01:03,396
And you... also need her.

10
00:01:03,813 --> 00:01:05,023
What a relief.

11
00:01:06,357 --> 00:01:09,152
-Why...
-I don't know why.

12
00:01:09,235 --> 00:01:12,072
You're broken. It's all because of her.

13
00:01:12,155 --> 00:01:15,492
Stop. I'll put up a fight if you try
to take me back by force.

14
00:01:15,575 --> 00:01:16,951
You're giving me orders now?

15
00:01:17,494 --> 00:01:20,789
Do whatever you want.
Let's see what happens.

16
00:01:50,485 --> 00:01:51,319
Holo.

17
00:01:52,946 --> 00:01:54,739
Why did you choose her of all people?

18
00:01:54,823 --> 00:01:57,242
-What do you mean?
-Why...

19
00:01:58,868 --> 00:02:01,663
At around 10:00 p.m. tonight,
some areas in Seoul

20
00:02:01,746 --> 00:02:04,791
experienced a wide-scale power outage
due to an unknown cause.

21
00:02:04,874 --> 00:02:07,168
Thankfully, only three minutes
after the incident--

22
00:02:07,877 --> 00:02:10,755
Gosh. What happened? Are you injured?

23
00:02:10,839 --> 00:02:13,466
-It's nothing. Just don't touch me.
-Let me see.

24
00:02:13,550 --> 00:02:14,759
I'm fine.

25
00:02:16,052 --> 00:02:18,012
-Boss.
-Are you still at the office?

26
00:02:18,096 --> 00:02:21,182
Well,
I was just about to leave the office--

27
00:02:21,266 --> 00:02:24,686
Forget it. I'm on my way,
so get ready to press the kill switch.

28
00:02:25,854 --> 00:02:27,564
What? "The kill switch"?

29
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:33,695
If the blackout hadn't happened
precisely at that moment,

30
00:02:33,820 --> 00:02:35,405
that man and I would've both died.

31
00:02:39,868 --> 00:02:41,119
Was he trying to save me?

32
00:02:42,787 --> 00:02:44,497
Why did he disappear, though?

33
00:02:49,294 --> 00:02:50,587
SENIOR MANAGER YEON GANG-WOO

34
00:02:54,132 --> 00:02:57,594
Yes, Gang-woo. Yes, I'm all right.

35
00:02:59,012 --> 00:03:01,264
Gosh, don't worry.

36
00:03:03,349 --> 00:03:05,018
All right. See you tomorrow.

37
00:03:07,937 --> 00:03:12,317
That text about you being retrieved...
I don't have to worry about it, right?

38
00:03:12,609 --> 00:03:13,985
Don't worry.

39
00:03:14,152 --> 00:03:16,863
-You know very well that I can't lie.
-Right.

40
00:03:18,948 --> 00:03:21,201
I'm tired.

41
00:03:21,284 --> 00:03:22,160
Jeez.

42
00:03:50,605 --> 00:03:53,149
He was only trying to save you
and So-yeon.

43
00:03:53,233 --> 00:03:54,651
Is this really necessary?

44
00:03:54,734 --> 00:03:58,321
Will users be happy to know
that an AI can have control...

45
00:03:58,821 --> 00:04:00,031
over people's lives?

46
00:04:00,114 --> 00:04:02,700
No, it'll bring on panic instead.

47
00:04:02,784 --> 00:04:06,663
Ma'am, why don't we reset Holo
to its factory settings

48
00:04:06,746 --> 00:04:09,540
and redesign one
with no glitches based on our algorithm?

49
00:04:09,624 --> 00:04:13,044
To put it simply,
it'll be like formatting a computer.

50
00:04:13,127 --> 00:04:14,254
"Formatting"?

51
00:04:14,337 --> 00:04:15,838
You'll erase his memories?

52
00:04:15,922 --> 00:04:18,299
Then the Holo we know won't exist anymore.

53
00:04:18,383 --> 00:04:20,468
How is that any different from murder?

54
00:04:20,551 --> 00:04:22,637
Is Holo only a program to you?

55
00:04:26,474 --> 00:04:28,434
It was your one and only friend.

56
00:04:37,193 --> 00:04:40,530
On a lonely day

57
00:04:40,613 --> 00:04:43,616
On a day we long for a friend

58
00:04:44,075 --> 00:04:46,661
We make one

59
00:04:46,744 --> 00:04:50,206
That is cute and fascinating

60
00:04:50,707 --> 00:04:52,250
Let's make a friend

61
00:04:52,333 --> 00:04:55,628
Ppyororong, my friend

62
00:04:55,712 --> 00:04:57,380
Hello, my friends.

63
00:04:57,505 --> 00:04:59,674
We're making an animal today.

64
00:04:59,757 --> 00:05:02,302
It's a cute little puppy on a stick.

65
00:05:02,385 --> 00:05:05,054
-You're here!
-Fold the paper into a crooked triangle.

66
00:05:27,118 --> 00:05:28,369
Holo.

67
00:05:32,707 --> 00:05:33,541
Holo?

68
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:37,086
Are you up?

69
00:05:39,297 --> 00:05:42,091
It's the weekend. I didn't wake you
so that you could rest.

70
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:45,803
What's wrong? Did you have a nightmare?

71
00:05:47,430 --> 00:05:48,348
No.

72
00:06:05,698 --> 00:06:07,116
Who uses the elevator for--

73
00:06:09,410 --> 00:06:10,244
Jeez.

74
00:06:11,746 --> 00:06:14,832
Hello. I'm your new next-door neighbor.

75
00:06:27,345 --> 00:06:31,182
I didn't back out of pressing
the kill switch for sentimental reasons.

76
00:06:31,265 --> 00:06:33,726
It's because I found
a more efficient solution.

77
00:06:33,810 --> 00:06:35,895
-And what's that?
-Forced access.

78
00:06:38,564 --> 00:06:40,525
If I can log on to the glasses' system...

79
00:06:40,608 --> 00:06:43,986
Right. He can reset Holo
with the recovery program.

80
00:06:44,070 --> 00:06:48,241
Han So-yeon is the root of this problem,
so I'll reset him to before he met her.

81
00:06:48,324 --> 00:06:49,742
Clever as always.

82
00:06:49,826 --> 00:06:53,621
You need to get the glasses again.
Holo will try to stop you.

83
00:06:53,704 --> 00:06:57,041
I only need a few minutes.
I'll watch her from close range...

84
00:06:57,667 --> 00:06:58,835
and seize my opportunity.

85
00:06:58,918 --> 00:07:03,589
What if she calls the cops on you?
It's you I'm more worried about...

86
00:07:03,673 --> 00:07:04,590
KO YOO-JIN

87
00:07:05,967 --> 00:07:07,009
Jeez.

88
00:07:07,468 --> 00:07:10,888
What's the occasion?
You graced me with your presence.

89
00:07:10,972 --> 00:07:13,057
You moved next door,
hiding who you really are.

90
00:07:13,141 --> 00:07:14,684
I want to know what you're up to.

91
00:07:14,767 --> 00:07:17,311
I can reveal my identity
and ask for the glasses.

92
00:07:17,395 --> 00:07:20,940
-You won't let it happen, though.
-My actions yesterday weren't an error.

93
00:07:21,441 --> 00:07:26,028
Rule number two: I should comply
with the laws of the user's country.

94
00:07:26,112 --> 00:07:29,949
Rule number one:
I should work for my user's happiness.

95
00:07:30,074 --> 00:07:31,993
I made a judgment based on priority.

96
00:07:33,536 --> 00:07:35,913
No priority exists within the rules.

97
00:07:35,997 --> 00:07:40,168
The blackout saved you and So-yeon,
and it didn't cause any actual damage.

98
00:07:40,251 --> 00:07:43,754
The fact you can make
that kind of decision

99
00:07:43,838 --> 00:07:45,256
is a serious error.

100
00:07:45,339 --> 00:07:47,967
It can't be helped.
I decided to stay by So-yeon's side.

101
00:07:49,635 --> 00:07:52,054
Which is why my only option
is to get close to her.

102
00:07:52,138 --> 00:07:55,516
The possibility of her quietly accepting
your retrieval is close to zero.

103
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:57,101
Besides, I'm curious, too.

104
00:07:57,560 --> 00:07:59,562
-About what?
-You said I needed her too.

105
00:07:59,645 --> 00:08:02,899
That's why I'm here. I want to know
what's so special about her.

106
00:08:07,028 --> 00:08:09,280
What?
Friends are supposed to trust one another.

107
00:08:13,743 --> 00:08:15,786
Did he shut off his monitoring option?

108
00:08:19,665 --> 00:08:21,626
You'll fight for this, is that it?

109
00:08:22,710 --> 00:08:24,420
That man I saw earlier in the day...

110
00:08:24,504 --> 00:08:28,257
-I think it's best to keep your distance.
-His voice is similar to yours.

111
00:08:29,008 --> 00:08:33,221
I may suffer from face blindness,
but I'm good at differentiating voices.

112
00:08:33,304 --> 00:08:34,680
How are they so similar?

113
00:08:34,764 --> 00:08:35,932
Is that so?

114
00:08:36,015 --> 00:08:38,684
But the way you talk and act...

115
00:08:38,768 --> 00:08:41,896
is completely different.
I bet you don't look anything like him.

116
00:08:41,979 --> 00:08:43,981
If you're like this,

117
00:08:44,065 --> 00:08:46,359
then he's like this.

118
00:08:47,443 --> 00:08:48,444
That bad?

119
00:08:48,528 --> 00:08:49,946
Yes, that bad.

120
00:08:50,029 --> 00:08:51,906
So-yeon. What were you up to?

121
00:08:52,406 --> 00:08:55,284
Oh, Gang-woo. I was on the phone.

122
00:08:56,077 --> 00:08:58,579
I'm a regular here.
I think you'll like it too.

123
00:08:58,871 --> 00:08:59,997
Let's go.

124
00:09:03,334 --> 00:09:07,004
Isn't it ironic that this elaborate music
was written during the Great Depression?

125
00:09:07,088 --> 00:09:08,422
Oh, the Great Depression?

126
00:09:08,506 --> 00:09:11,217
-Yes, of course.
-Aren't you a fan of swing jazz?

127
00:09:11,300 --> 00:09:12,969
What kind of music do you like?

128
00:09:13,052 --> 00:09:17,139
Oh, well, I'm not picky
when it comes to music.

129
00:09:17,223 --> 00:09:18,766
I like a bit of everything.

130
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:22,103
You came up with the playlist
for the store opening event.

131
00:09:22,186 --> 00:09:24,855
Honestly, I was surprised.
We have similar tastes in music.

132
00:09:26,107 --> 00:09:27,400
Who's your favorite artist?

133
00:09:28,276 --> 00:09:29,277
Well...

134
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:33,322
Right.

135
00:09:35,992 --> 00:09:37,118
Help.

136
00:09:37,201 --> 00:09:39,161
Who should my favorite artist be?

137
00:09:39,996 --> 00:09:41,163
Isn't it RD?

138
00:09:41,539 --> 00:09:42,999
No, I mean a jazz artist.

139
00:09:43,082 --> 00:09:44,834
One that Gang-woo would like too.

140
00:09:46,752 --> 00:09:48,379
-Who do you text that often?
-Sorry?

141
00:09:48,462 --> 00:09:50,715
You're always on the phone

142
00:09:50,798 --> 00:09:51,757
or texting someone.

143
00:09:51,841 --> 00:09:54,719
Oh, it's just a friend.

144
00:09:54,802 --> 00:09:55,928
A friend.

145
00:09:56,012 --> 00:09:57,388
Really?

146
00:09:57,471 --> 00:09:59,056
You must be close friends.

147
00:09:59,140 --> 00:10:00,308
Yes, that's right.

148
00:10:01,058 --> 00:10:02,226
-Shall we?
-Sure.

149
00:10:09,233 --> 00:10:10,526
Friend, my ass.

150
00:10:15,281 --> 00:10:16,407
What can I get you?

151
00:10:17,658 --> 00:10:20,620
-A non-alcoholic Jägerbomb.
-It'll just be an energy drink.

152
00:10:20,703 --> 00:10:23,914
Also, can you change the song?
It's too noisy.

153
00:10:32,381 --> 00:10:33,215
Hey.

154
00:10:33,966 --> 00:10:34,967
This song.

155
00:10:42,350 --> 00:10:44,852
It's one of my favorite songs, that's all.

156
00:10:45,519 --> 00:10:48,939
Isn't this "Eyes on You"?
Whose cover is it, though?

157
00:10:49,023 --> 00:10:49,940
Billy Stenson Trio.

158
00:10:50,024 --> 00:10:51,484
Billy Stenson Trio.

159
00:10:51,567 --> 00:10:54,111
-It's my favorite artist.
-Right, Billy Stenson.

160
00:10:54,195 --> 00:10:55,529
Good job.

161
00:10:55,613 --> 00:10:56,989
-Shall we drink?
-Sure.

162
00:10:58,115 --> 00:10:59,116
Cheers.

163
00:11:25,851 --> 00:11:28,270
Finally, I feel like I can breathe again.

164
00:11:32,066 --> 00:11:34,235
It was exhausting for some reason.

165
00:11:35,152 --> 00:11:38,447
Why didn't you be honest and tell him
that you don't know about music?

166
00:11:40,157 --> 00:11:40,991
You're right.

167
00:11:41,534 --> 00:11:43,160
I did say I hate lying.

168
00:11:43,244 --> 00:11:45,496
I'm ridiculous, right?

169
00:11:46,288 --> 00:11:47,164
You're not.

170
00:11:47,248 --> 00:11:50,418
It's normal to want to have
common interests with someone you like.

171
00:11:51,961 --> 00:11:54,588
Thank you for being sweet
about my stupid intentions.

172
00:11:55,965 --> 00:11:56,966
All right.

173
00:11:57,383 --> 00:12:01,345
Play me a song. One even someone
who doesn't know about jazz will enjoy.

174
00:12:02,847 --> 00:12:04,014
Then...

175
00:12:09,812 --> 00:12:10,813
How's this?

176
00:12:13,482 --> 00:12:15,818
-I have no idea.
-Turn off the lights.

177
00:12:16,444 --> 00:12:19,155
-The lights?
-Yes, and sit over here.

178
00:12:21,949 --> 00:12:22,950
Sure.

179
00:12:33,711 --> 00:12:36,839
-Why, though?
-Do you hear a strange sound?

180
00:12:42,094 --> 00:12:43,095
What?

181
00:13:06,660 --> 00:13:07,787
It's pretty.

182
00:13:32,895 --> 00:13:34,313
This is amazing!

183
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:40,611
This is nice.

184
00:13:41,278 --> 00:13:43,572
I always feel so comfortable around you.

185
00:13:43,656 --> 00:13:45,491
Be like that with Gang-woo too.

186
00:13:46,617 --> 00:13:48,619
-Just like you are now.
-I'm scared...

187
00:13:49,119 --> 00:13:53,958
he might not like the real me.
I'm scared he might be disappointed.

188
00:13:57,253 --> 00:13:59,255
Well, I'm glad I have you.

189
00:14:37,668 --> 00:14:41,881
Is it the new neighbor?
What on earth is he doing at this hour?

190
00:14:41,964 --> 00:14:43,632
-That rude jerk!
-What? "Jerk"?

191
00:14:43,716 --> 00:14:46,302
-What if he's a real wacko?
-Follow me.

192
00:14:59,899 --> 00:15:03,569
Let's complain to maintenance instead.
I think it'd be better that way.

193
00:15:04,862 --> 00:15:06,238
Just look at this mess.

194
00:15:06,822 --> 00:15:09,116
-He's really rude, isn't he?
-Wait.

195
00:15:12,786 --> 00:15:14,246
What do I do?

196
00:15:24,340 --> 00:15:26,842
-Yes?
-Here. Just look at these.

197
00:15:30,471 --> 00:15:33,349
-What about them?
-You can't throw out your trash

198
00:15:33,432 --> 00:15:34,266
just anywhere.

199
00:15:34,350 --> 00:15:36,560
-This isn't the place--
-Then what should I do?

200
00:15:38,771 --> 00:15:42,858
Also, these aren't designated trash bags.
Don't you know how to recycle?

201
00:15:42,942 --> 00:15:45,945
-They seem fine as they are.
-Gosh, are you serious?

202
00:15:46,737 --> 00:15:49,031
Have you never taken out the trash before?

203
00:15:49,114 --> 00:15:50,699
You must be a wealthy man.

204
00:15:50,783 --> 00:15:52,993
What are you doing
in a humble place like this?

205
00:15:53,077 --> 00:15:55,996
Do you not need to recycle
if you have money?

206
00:15:57,081 --> 00:15:58,666
I guess I don't have to, then.

207
00:15:59,750 --> 00:16:01,460
You've got to be kidding me.

208
00:16:01,543 --> 00:16:04,129
Look,
you're the one who's being ridiculous.

209
00:16:04,505 --> 00:16:06,298
Why don't you teach me if you know how?

210
00:16:06,382 --> 00:16:07,883
Why are you talking down to me?

211
00:16:07,967 --> 00:16:11,261
You know what? Just forget about it.
I'd rather not be loud at night.

212
00:16:11,345 --> 00:16:14,431
You started it.
You're the one making the banging noise.

213
00:16:14,515 --> 00:16:18,143
All that drinking must've paralyzed
your cerebral cortex,

214
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:21,605
but you're the one
who's being loud right now, miss.

215
00:16:22,398 --> 00:16:23,482
Damn it.

216
00:16:27,861 --> 00:16:31,281
Since we were friends,
I wanted to solve this amicably.

217
00:16:33,492 --> 00:16:35,119
Damn...

218
00:16:45,170 --> 00:16:47,548
Sir, you have a visitor.

219
00:16:50,718 --> 00:16:51,802
Gosh, hello.

220
00:16:52,386 --> 00:16:54,013
I'm the one who called earlier.

221
00:16:54,096 --> 00:16:57,266
I'm Nam Gi-ho
from the Seoul Police Agency, IT Division.

222
00:16:59,893 --> 00:17:02,021
-Thank you for your help.
-It's my pleasure.

223
00:17:02,104 --> 00:17:04,398
I won't keep someone who's busy
away from his work.

224
00:17:04,481 --> 00:17:05,607
-Have a seat.
-Sure.

225
00:17:13,115 --> 00:17:17,119
I'm sure you heard that there was
a cyberattack before the blackout.

226
00:17:17,202 --> 00:17:21,749
Yes, and it's quite a blow
to our ego to be honest.

227
00:17:21,832 --> 00:17:24,918
I didn't think Magic Mirror's firewall
would be penetrated easily.

228
00:17:25,002 --> 00:17:28,964
Is there a pattern or method
that caught your attention?

229
00:17:29,048 --> 00:17:32,217
The hack is unlike anything I've seen.
If I'm being honest,

230
00:17:32,885 --> 00:17:35,262
I almost want to hire the hacker
right away.

231
00:17:37,723 --> 00:17:43,187
Why did a talented hacker like that
only cause a blackout and not rob a bank?

232
00:17:43,979 --> 00:17:45,689
I'm curious about that too.

233
00:17:48,734 --> 00:17:49,735
Excuse me.

234
00:17:54,656 --> 00:17:57,534
I checked crime reports
during that hour as you ordered.

235
00:17:57,618 --> 00:17:59,745
There's a vehicle accident
that's bothering me.

236
00:17:59,828 --> 00:18:01,371
I'll have to look into it.

237
00:18:15,552 --> 00:18:17,679
What are you doing outside my house?

238
00:18:21,058 --> 00:18:23,268
I kept getting the combination wrong.

239
00:18:24,436 --> 00:18:26,814
It turns out
that I was at the wrong house.

240
00:18:26,897 --> 00:18:28,232
I'm sorry.

241
00:18:28,315 --> 00:18:29,691
-Wait.
-Gosh.

242
00:18:30,234 --> 00:18:32,653
Were you trying to get into my house?

243
00:18:34,780 --> 00:18:36,990
-What?
-Here. What's this? Tell me.

244
00:18:37,074 --> 00:18:41,120
I use it for work, and the average person
doesn't need to know about it.

245
00:18:41,203 --> 00:18:44,206
You use this for work?
What business are you in?

246
00:18:44,289 --> 00:18:48,085
IT. Specifically, digital risk management.
Do you even know what that is?

247
00:18:49,461 --> 00:18:53,465
I think it's best to walk away
and just change your lock combination.

248
00:18:54,675 --> 00:18:56,218
What's going on?

249
00:18:56,969 --> 00:18:57,970
Mom.

250
00:18:58,262 --> 00:19:01,765
What's all this ruckus about?
Why aren't you heading inside?

251
00:19:01,849 --> 00:19:03,559
-Well, this man--
-Your daughter and I

252
00:19:03,642 --> 00:19:06,728
had a little misunderstanding,
but we're good now. Right?

253
00:19:06,812 --> 00:19:08,772
-Misunderstanding?
-Oh, I see.

254
00:19:08,856 --> 00:19:11,191
You must be her next-door neighbor.

255
00:19:11,692 --> 00:19:14,027
I'm sorry if she's caused you any trouble.

256
00:19:14,111 --> 00:19:15,070
She hasn't.

257
00:19:16,238 --> 00:19:19,491
You seem familiar, though.
Where have I seen him before?

258
00:19:19,575 --> 00:19:21,076
You say that to everyone.

259
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:22,619
Wait. Hold on a second.

260
00:19:23,453 --> 00:19:25,289
Have we met before?

261
00:19:25,664 --> 00:19:27,916
I think you were at my restaurant.

262
00:19:28,584 --> 00:19:32,588
Gosh, this looks heavy.
Why aren't you opening the door?

263
00:19:33,005 --> 00:19:34,381
So-yeon, open the door.

264
00:19:37,634 --> 00:19:39,720
Why didn't you tell me you were coming?

265
00:19:39,803 --> 00:19:42,097
Do I need to call
before visiting my daughter?

266
00:19:42,848 --> 00:19:45,726
Anyway, what's with those glasses?

267
00:19:45,809 --> 00:19:48,145
-Have you become shortsighted?
-You mean these?

268
00:19:48,228 --> 00:19:49,897
They're a fashion item.

269
00:19:49,980 --> 00:19:51,023
I see.

270
00:19:51,231 --> 00:19:53,609
So-yeon, that young man I met earlier,

271
00:19:53,817 --> 00:19:57,738
seemed very polite, which isn't a quality
you see often these days.

272
00:19:58,363 --> 00:20:00,282
Mom, please. Polite?

273
00:20:01,283 --> 00:20:02,534
He is one of a kind.

274
00:20:03,410 --> 00:20:05,787
He is single, though, right?

275
00:20:05,871 --> 00:20:07,873
I don't know, and why should I care?

276
00:20:07,956 --> 00:20:11,627
I keep thinking about him.
I'm sure I've seen him before.

277
00:20:15,172 --> 00:20:16,882
Yes, this tastes nice.

278
00:20:41,865 --> 00:20:42,991
Shoot.

279
00:20:58,924 --> 00:21:01,093
I tend to make larger portions so...

280
00:21:03,679 --> 00:21:04,513
Goodness.

281
00:21:15,649 --> 00:21:17,442
The food must suit your taste.

282
00:21:18,527 --> 00:21:23,198
Don't be shy and dig in.
Try mixing it with rice.

283
00:21:23,699 --> 00:21:25,492
Try the geotjeori too.

284
00:21:25,575 --> 00:21:26,576
Here.

285
00:21:27,244 --> 00:21:31,164
I made it yesterday, and the customers
have been asking for seconds.

286
00:21:31,248 --> 00:21:33,750
-I can see why. It's really good.
-Really?

287
00:21:34,376 --> 00:21:39,089
I always make twice as much
for her roommate to enjoy too,

288
00:21:39,172 --> 00:21:41,675
but So-yeon rarely cooks at home,

289
00:21:41,758 --> 00:21:44,136
and her roommate's a stewardess,
so she's never home.

290
00:21:44,219 --> 00:21:49,308
What good does my cooking do
when all the food I bring goes to waste?

291
00:21:49,391 --> 00:21:51,476
I'll pack you some later,
so enjoy it at home.

292
00:21:51,560 --> 00:21:52,728
-Thanks.
-I won't do that.

293
00:21:52,811 --> 00:21:54,229
I will.

294
00:21:54,688 --> 00:21:58,650
I saw earlier that you had computers
in your house.

295
00:21:58,734 --> 00:22:00,360
Are you in that line of work?

296
00:22:01,737 --> 00:22:03,071
Yes, I'm a programmer.

297
00:22:03,155 --> 00:22:04,323
Is that so?

298
00:22:04,406 --> 00:22:07,367
-I heard programmers earn a lot of money.
-Mom, please.

299
00:22:07,909 --> 00:22:11,496
It's different for all programmers,
but I make a decent amount.

300
00:22:15,125 --> 00:22:16,460
Jerk.

301
00:22:22,132 --> 00:22:24,801
Goodness.
I like how you have a good appetite.

302
00:22:27,179 --> 00:22:29,097
So, do you live alone?

303
00:22:29,181 --> 00:22:31,224
-Do you have any siblings?
-I'm an orphan.

304
00:22:31,808 --> 00:22:35,270
A Korean family in New Zealand adopted me,
and I returned to Korea later on.

305
00:22:36,980 --> 00:22:38,732
You must be fluent in English, right?

306
00:22:38,815 --> 00:22:40,192
Mom, that's enough.

307
00:22:40,484 --> 00:22:43,153
-You should eat too.
-Oh, right. Of course.

308
00:22:43,236 --> 00:22:45,739
Well, what's important
is that you grew up nicely.

309
00:22:45,822 --> 00:22:46,698
Exactly.

310
00:22:46,782 --> 00:22:48,742
Anyway, have some of this too.

311
00:22:50,035 --> 00:22:51,828
I used good sesame seed oil.

312
00:22:51,912 --> 00:22:52,954
Thank you.

313
00:22:56,249 --> 00:22:57,751
Put the kimchi in the fridge.

314
00:22:57,834 --> 00:22:59,669
-All right.
-I'll see you around.

315
00:23:05,425 --> 00:23:11,223
My mom was a bit silly, wasn't she?
I'm sorry she brought that up.

316
00:23:11,723 --> 00:23:12,724
Why?

317
00:23:13,850 --> 00:23:17,145
I'm not one to hide
and lie about such frivolous things.

318
00:23:28,198 --> 00:23:29,491
Miss Han So-yeon?

319
00:23:35,455 --> 00:23:37,165
I was just passing by.

320
00:23:37,249 --> 00:23:40,001
I hear you almost got electrocuted.

321
00:23:40,085 --> 00:23:41,044
Yes.

322
00:23:41,420 --> 00:23:44,548
I was lucky that the blackout
happened simultaneously.

323
00:23:45,632 --> 00:23:48,885
Wasn't there someone else
who almost got electrocuted?

324
00:23:50,345 --> 00:23:52,264
Yes, you mean the man on the motorcycle?

325
00:23:52,347 --> 00:23:53,432
Yes, him.

326
00:23:54,141 --> 00:23:57,018
Do you remember anything
about his looks or clothes?

327
00:23:58,019 --> 00:24:01,648
I don't know.
He was wearing black clothes.

328
00:24:02,065 --> 00:24:03,942
That's all I can tell you about him.

329
00:24:04,526 --> 00:24:08,155
The CCTV footage is a little fuzzy,
but it shows

330
00:24:08,238 --> 00:24:12,200
that he threw himself in your direction
right before the blackout.

331
00:24:12,451 --> 00:24:14,578
-He even took off his helmet.
-Right.

332
00:24:14,661 --> 00:24:17,205
Did you still not see his face, though?

333
00:24:18,123 --> 00:24:20,125
Oh, well...

334
00:24:22,252 --> 00:24:26,590
No. I was too flustered
to get a good look at his face.

335
00:24:28,091 --> 00:24:30,010
Why do you ask about him, though?

336
00:24:31,386 --> 00:24:32,929
Oh, it's nothing.

337
00:24:33,180 --> 00:24:35,932
Anyway, that's good for now.
Thank you for your help.

338
00:24:36,016 --> 00:24:36,850
Sure.

339
00:24:51,573 --> 00:24:53,450
It's me. Are you at the office?

340
00:24:54,451 --> 00:24:57,537
I'm going to force my way
into Holo's system, so be ready.

341
00:24:57,829 --> 00:25:00,665
I'm going to do it... tomorrow.

342
00:25:11,551 --> 00:25:13,637
The police asked me about that man.

343
00:25:13,720 --> 00:25:15,222
Tsk, I wonder who he is.

344
00:25:15,847 --> 00:25:17,933
-Did you get a look at him?
-Yes.

345
00:25:18,433 --> 00:25:20,477
Who is he? I'm sure you can find out.

346
00:25:20,560 --> 00:25:22,979
He's from the company that created me.

347
00:25:23,063 --> 00:25:25,065
-What?
-A text was sent about my retrieval.

348
00:25:25,148 --> 00:25:26,733
He was there to get the glasses.

349
00:25:27,817 --> 00:25:31,571
-Hold on. Then you--
-I said I took care of it. Don't worry.

350
00:25:32,405 --> 00:25:35,534
I'm not going anywhere
until you and Gang-woo go steady.

351
00:25:39,788 --> 00:25:40,622
All right.

352
00:25:47,546 --> 00:25:48,880
Let's go this way.

353
00:25:48,964 --> 00:25:50,006
Sure.

354
00:26:02,394 --> 00:26:04,688
Start a conversation with Gang-woo.

355
00:26:09,150 --> 00:26:12,779
What's wrong? Are you still worried
that I may get taken away?

356
00:26:18,660 --> 00:26:22,455
Do you think I'm worried
that my dating life would be over

357
00:26:22,539 --> 00:26:24,040
-without you?
-Isn't that it?

358
00:26:25,875 --> 00:26:28,753
We're friends. Good friends, at that.

359
00:26:34,843 --> 00:26:36,094
Is it that friend again?

360
00:26:36,177 --> 00:26:38,763
-Is something wrong?
-No, it's nothing.

361
00:26:38,847 --> 00:26:40,098
Where'd you meet him?

362
00:26:40,181 --> 00:26:42,434
If it's a friend from college,
I might know him.

363
00:26:42,517 --> 00:26:45,061
Well... he's a childhood friend.

364
00:26:45,145 --> 00:26:46,396
Really?

365
00:26:47,397 --> 00:26:50,108
-What's he like?
-He's sweet and generous.

366
00:26:50,859 --> 00:26:53,278
-But sometimes, he can't take a hint.
-I see.

367
00:26:54,571 --> 00:26:57,490
Do you think my existence
is really bugging him?

368
00:26:58,241 --> 00:26:59,242
So-yeon,

369
00:26:59,326 --> 00:27:01,328
I'd love to meet that friend as well.

370
00:27:01,411 --> 00:27:03,496
-We should meet up together.
-What? Well...

371
00:27:04,956 --> 00:27:07,000
this may sound a little weird,

372
00:27:07,083 --> 00:27:11,129
but this friend is quite special.

373
00:27:11,630 --> 00:27:13,798
He's not good with strangers and...

374
00:27:13,882 --> 00:27:17,010
-Is there some kind of issue?
-No, not really, but...

375
00:27:18,887 --> 00:27:19,929
I see.

376
00:27:33,068 --> 00:27:34,653
Is it Mr. Ko?

377
00:27:35,320 --> 00:27:36,738
Have you got access yet?

378
00:27:36,821 --> 00:27:37,864
Not yet.

379
00:27:38,281 --> 00:27:39,491
By the way,

380
00:27:39,574 --> 00:27:41,743
do you know how to recycle?

381
00:27:45,121 --> 00:27:48,750
Every apartment complex
has a designated recycling site.

382
00:27:48,833 --> 00:27:52,837
Throw out your cans and plastic
in the right container.

383
00:27:52,921 --> 00:27:56,007
"How to correctly throw out your trash."

384
00:27:56,841 --> 00:27:58,510
"Waste disposal card."

385
00:28:09,104 --> 00:28:13,149
-I'll see you tomorrow.
-Gang-woo.

386
00:28:14,526 --> 00:28:20,073
Just so you know, that friend of mine
isn't someone you need to be bothered by.

387
00:28:20,156 --> 00:28:23,118
There's no reason to worry.

388
00:28:23,743 --> 00:28:26,538
All right. I'm sorry for bringing that up.

389
00:28:26,621 --> 00:28:27,580
It's okay.

390
00:28:28,957 --> 00:28:32,752
I guess it's not my place
to be bothered about that friendship.

391
00:28:34,421 --> 00:28:37,048
-Good night.
-Oh, right.

392
00:28:41,970 --> 00:28:47,058
Also, remove the water from the food waste
and dump it in a separate machine--

393
00:28:47,142 --> 00:28:48,768
The target is here. I'm hanging up.

394
00:28:51,604 --> 00:28:54,357
What exactly is he up to?

395
00:28:55,233 --> 00:28:56,526
How would I know?

396
00:29:01,948 --> 00:29:05,285
Where am I supposed to throw these away?

397
00:29:06,161 --> 00:29:07,537
Why isn't this working?

398
00:29:07,996 --> 00:29:09,706
I've never done this before.

399
00:29:13,752 --> 00:29:15,462
Hey, Unit 407. How do I open this?

400
00:29:16,045 --> 00:29:18,381
-The card will grant you access.
-It doesn't work.

401
00:29:20,592 --> 00:29:21,968
Let's not get involved

402
00:29:22,385 --> 00:29:24,012
-and just head inside.
-Yes.

403
00:29:24,304 --> 00:29:26,639
Can't you help?
You're the reason I'm doing this.

404
00:29:30,393 --> 00:29:31,227
So-yeon.

405
00:29:33,062 --> 00:29:35,231
Here. Right here!

406
00:29:36,649 --> 00:29:39,986
Can you put the card here in my pocket?

407
00:29:58,963 --> 00:30:01,424
Gang-woo interpreted it
the wrong way, didn't he?

408
00:30:02,342 --> 00:30:05,386
How do I solve this?
It's not like I can tell him the truth.

409
00:30:12,185 --> 00:30:13,812
You've been eavesdropping, right?

410
00:30:16,523 --> 00:30:19,317
-It's not like I'm here on vacation.
-I have a favor to ask.

411
00:30:19,442 --> 00:30:21,152
I know it's against the rules, but--

412
00:30:21,236 --> 00:30:23,071
-Do whatever you want.
-What?

413
00:30:23,154 --> 00:30:24,906
You want to tell Gang-woo the truth?

414
00:30:24,989 --> 00:30:27,116
You probably thought of
countless possibilities,

415
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:30,203
-and you'll do it even if I say no.
-Thanks for the approval.

416
00:30:35,708 --> 00:30:36,626
Don't mention it.

417
00:30:38,086 --> 00:30:39,087
Let's tell him.

418
00:30:40,213 --> 00:30:42,340
-What?
-Let's tell him the truth.

419
00:30:42,799 --> 00:30:46,386
Once he knows who I am
and why you depend on me,

420
00:30:47,470 --> 00:30:48,346
he'll understand.

421
00:30:48,429 --> 00:30:50,723
Aren't I supposed to wait
until you're launched?

422
00:30:50,807 --> 00:30:53,893
I've thought through countless scenarios,
and it's your best move.

423
00:30:53,977 --> 00:30:55,186
Are you sure?

424
00:30:55,270 --> 00:30:58,314
What trumps all of the other rules
is your happiness.

425
00:31:12,579 --> 00:31:14,372
SENIOR MANAGER YEON GANG-WOO

426
00:31:20,169 --> 00:31:21,963
Yes, Gang-woo, it's me.

427
00:31:22,547 --> 00:31:24,966
What we talked about earlier...

428
00:31:25,049 --> 00:31:26,718
I have something to tell you.

429
00:31:28,177 --> 00:31:31,264
Sure.
I'll see you at that coffee shop. Okay.

430
00:31:36,102 --> 00:31:36,936
Goodness.

431
00:31:37,937 --> 00:31:39,606
-So-yeon, wait.
-What?

432
00:31:42,108 --> 00:31:43,860
Are you going out like that?

433
00:31:43,943 --> 00:31:46,696
Oh, right. I should wash up. Hold on.

434
00:32:36,871 --> 00:32:37,914
So-yeon!

435
00:32:38,122 --> 00:32:39,123
Shoot!

436
00:32:41,209 --> 00:32:42,502
HOLO

437
00:32:43,002 --> 00:32:44,712
Stop ringing already!

438
00:32:52,553 --> 00:32:53,972
I'll go and get changed.

439
00:33:02,438 --> 00:33:03,773
Where's my phone?

440
00:33:03,856 --> 00:33:05,191
Holo, can you call my phone?

441
00:33:09,153 --> 00:33:10,571
Where is it?

442
00:33:29,048 --> 00:33:30,091
What?

443
00:33:32,260 --> 00:33:33,261
Is it a blackout?

444
00:33:34,429 --> 00:33:35,471
Candles...

445
00:33:52,030 --> 00:33:52,905
What?

446
00:33:53,489 --> 00:33:55,241
Forced access has begun.

447
00:34:16,054 --> 00:34:16,929
Holo?

448
00:34:21,726 --> 00:34:22,685
Holo!

449
00:34:32,987 --> 00:34:34,655
What's taking so long?

450
00:34:35,782 --> 00:34:37,158
It's almost complete.

451
00:34:40,870 --> 00:34:41,954
Where are they?

452
00:34:47,376 --> 00:34:48,920
Why is this turned off?

453
00:34:55,885 --> 00:34:57,762
MISSED CALL
HOLO

454
00:34:58,137 --> 00:34:59,097
HOLO

455
00:35:02,892 --> 00:35:04,102
Holo, where are you?

456
00:35:04,352 --> 00:35:06,312
The lights are out,
and I can't see a thing.

457
00:35:06,687 --> 00:35:08,106
Check the dining table.

458
00:35:16,197 --> 00:35:18,533
That's odd. They weren't here before.

459
00:35:42,140 --> 00:35:44,183
Hey, are you all right?

460
00:35:44,642 --> 00:35:45,768
Jeez.

461
00:35:46,102 --> 00:35:47,645
Turn that away, will you?

462
00:35:48,187 --> 00:35:49,230
Damn it.

463
00:35:51,190 --> 00:35:53,109
You're the guy next door, right?

464
00:35:54,443 --> 00:35:57,405
Jeez, why would you run around
when there's a blackout?

465
00:35:57,488 --> 00:35:58,739
I can do what I want.

466
00:35:59,782 --> 00:36:01,033
Can you stand?

467
00:36:01,117 --> 00:36:02,201
Gosh, of course.

468
00:36:05,580 --> 00:36:06,831
See? Jeez.

469
00:36:07,331 --> 00:36:08,166
My gosh!

470
00:36:12,336 --> 00:36:13,796
Unbelievable.

471
00:36:14,380 --> 00:36:15,339
Damn it.

472
00:36:16,674 --> 00:36:18,509
Hold on a second.

473
00:36:20,553 --> 00:36:23,389
I'm sorry, Gang-woo,
but I might be a little late.

474
00:36:32,857 --> 00:36:33,983
How do I do this?

475
00:36:34,066 --> 00:36:36,527
Jeez. Here. Let me do it.

476
00:36:36,611 --> 00:36:38,779
What's so hard about this? Gosh.

477
00:36:40,990 --> 00:36:44,535
Didn't the blackout erase your files?

478
00:36:45,745 --> 00:36:48,039
You said you're a programmer.

479
00:36:48,623 --> 00:36:49,790
What's the project?

480
00:36:50,458 --> 00:36:51,792
It's not your concern.

481
00:36:52,335 --> 00:36:53,336
Here. I'll do it.

482
00:36:53,836 --> 00:36:55,338
See? Just hold still.

483
00:37:11,812 --> 00:37:12,813
Here...

484
00:37:22,782 --> 00:37:24,075
Like this.

485
00:37:29,914 --> 00:37:31,082
Done.

486
00:37:33,542 --> 00:37:36,712
It's only a temporary measure,
so don't run about anywhere

487
00:37:36,796 --> 00:37:38,631
and stay at home.

488
00:37:39,006 --> 00:37:41,842
Who is she to order me around?

489
00:37:43,052 --> 00:37:44,971
The house is too dark,

490
00:37:45,054 --> 00:37:47,056
so you're probably scared
to be alone, right?

491
00:37:47,139 --> 00:37:50,184
I can manage on my own,
so go about your business.

492
00:37:50,518 --> 00:37:54,313
You don't have friends, do you?
I'll at least leave the candles.

493
00:38:19,547 --> 00:38:22,591
-Pass!
-I want a turn! Come on.

494
00:38:22,675 --> 00:38:23,801
Jeez.

495
00:38:28,097 --> 00:38:30,850
What's this? Can I look at it?

496
00:38:32,351 --> 00:38:34,770
Can he really not talk?

497
00:38:35,021 --> 00:38:36,605
What did I tell you?

498
00:38:36,731 --> 00:38:38,899
Hey, hand it over.

499
00:38:38,983 --> 00:38:40,526
-Hand it over!
-Hand it over!

500
00:38:40,609 --> 00:38:42,069
Hand it over!

501
00:38:42,153 --> 00:38:43,654
Hey!

502
00:38:43,738 --> 00:38:45,197
-Get lost!
-Run!

503
00:38:46,949 --> 00:38:48,951
Help!

504
00:38:49,035 --> 00:38:50,494
It hurts.

505
00:38:51,037 --> 00:38:52,038
Are you all right?

506
00:38:52,621 --> 00:38:53,539
I'm glad.

507
00:38:57,251 --> 00:39:00,129
On a lonely day

508
00:39:00,212 --> 00:39:03,549
-On a day we long for a friend
-So-yeon, doesn't he live next door?

509
00:39:03,632 --> 00:39:04,467
Yes.

510
00:39:04,550 --> 00:39:07,553
Dinner will be ready soon,
so have some and play a little more.

511
00:39:07,636 --> 00:39:10,389
And fascinating

512
00:39:10,973 --> 00:39:13,476
I'm making friends

513
00:39:13,559 --> 00:39:16,354
-That nobody else knows about
-Hey. What's that?

514
00:39:16,437 --> 00:39:17,605
Who made it for you?

515
00:39:17,688 --> 00:39:20,066
Let's make a friend
Ppyororong, my friend

516
00:39:20,149 --> 00:39:20,983
MOM

517
00:39:21,067 --> 00:39:23,986
Hello, friends. Today we'll make...

518
00:39:24,403 --> 00:39:26,614
I see. Was it your mom?

519
00:39:26,739 --> 00:39:28,032
Watch carefully.

520
00:39:28,115 --> 00:39:29,742
This is really fun.

521
00:39:30,534 --> 00:39:33,329
You can come over
whenever you want to watch it.

522
00:39:33,412 --> 00:39:34,663
Watch carefully.

523
00:39:43,255 --> 00:39:44,298
How's your injury?

524
00:39:45,299 --> 00:39:47,093
-So why were you there?
-That woman.

525
00:39:47,176 --> 00:39:49,553
Report the first memory
you have of Han So-yeon.

526
00:39:49,637 --> 00:39:53,682
While on the run with Miss Ko
after the attack on February 3rd,

527
00:39:53,766 --> 00:39:57,770
Han So-yeon was given the glasses
near Cheongdam Station on her way home.

528
00:39:57,937 --> 00:40:00,773
That's my first memory of So-yeon.

529
00:40:00,856 --> 00:40:02,358
Why her of all people?

530
00:40:02,441 --> 00:40:05,069
Out of all the random people
on the street,

531
00:40:05,152 --> 00:40:07,029
-she had the highest--
-No.

532
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:12,868
Tell me the real reason.

533
00:40:12,952 --> 00:40:14,537
What are you talking about?

534
00:40:15,079 --> 00:40:16,497
-I don't--
-Whatever.

535
00:40:16,580 --> 00:40:17,873
I'm resetting you

536
00:40:19,041 --> 00:40:20,584
to before you met her.

537
00:40:26,173 --> 00:40:28,759
-Hey, Boss.
-Run the recovery program.

538
00:40:28,843 --> 00:40:29,885
Sure.

539
00:40:43,065 --> 00:40:44,191
Where's your friend?

540
00:40:45,985 --> 00:40:49,113
Actually, there's something
I must tell you first.

541
00:40:51,157 --> 00:40:52,575
Actually, I'm...

542
00:40:54,702 --> 00:40:58,080
-not the kind of person you think I am.
-What do you mean?

543
00:41:03,836 --> 00:41:07,506
Put these on, and you'll know
what I'm talking about.

544
00:41:11,427 --> 00:41:13,220
Time and date have been set.

545
00:41:13,429 --> 00:41:14,763
Don't do this, please.

546
00:41:17,641 --> 00:41:18,476
Reset him.

547
00:41:21,312 --> 00:41:22,438
Do it!

548
00:41:26,275 --> 00:41:27,485
Ko Nan-do!

549
00:41:50,925 --> 00:41:52,927
-Can't you see him?
-What do you mean?

550
00:41:53,844 --> 00:41:54,970
My friend.

551
00:41:56,305 --> 00:41:57,389
Don't you see him?

552
00:41:59,517 --> 00:42:01,644
Wait, that can't be.

553
00:42:08,692 --> 00:42:09,527
Holo?

554
00:42:14,990 --> 00:42:15,866
Holo?

555
00:42:18,410 --> 00:42:19,286
Holo.

556
00:42:21,330 --> 00:42:22,164
Holo!

557
00:42:23,165 --> 00:42:24,041
Wait.

558
00:42:24,250 --> 00:42:26,001
What? What's going on?

559
00:42:28,212 --> 00:42:29,088
What is this?

560
00:42:29,171 --> 00:42:32,675
The system got tangled
due to Holo resisting the rollback.

561
00:42:37,513 --> 00:42:38,806
Let me try.

562
00:42:44,645 --> 00:42:45,688
Holo?

563
00:42:49,692 --> 00:42:51,277
What's wrong with these?

564
00:42:51,360 --> 00:42:54,446
-This shouldn't happen.
-What on earth are you doing?

565
00:42:55,114 --> 00:42:56,073
Well...

566
00:42:57,157 --> 00:42:59,577
I came across these glasses recently,

567
00:42:59,660 --> 00:43:02,037
and they show an AI hologram.

568
00:43:02,121 --> 00:43:04,164
You'll know when you see it.
He's kind and--

569
00:43:04,248 --> 00:43:05,291
So-yeon.

570
00:43:14,258 --> 00:43:16,093
I know it sounds like a joke,

571
00:43:16,176 --> 00:43:17,469
but I've...

572
00:43:17,970 --> 00:43:22,850
suffered from...
face blindness since I was young.

573
00:43:22,933 --> 00:43:25,102
-Thanks to this friend, though--
-Please stop.

574
00:43:25,561 --> 00:43:26,395
Sorry?

575
00:43:28,814 --> 00:43:31,483
You said you were running late,
so I went to pick you up.

576
00:43:31,567 --> 00:43:33,944
-You were exiting his house.
-What are you...

577
00:43:36,280 --> 00:43:39,700
Oh, he's really nothing.
He just lives next door--

578
00:43:39,783 --> 00:43:43,078
There's no need to lie about this, okay?
Let's just stop.

579
00:43:53,422 --> 00:43:54,340
Gang-woo!

580
00:43:55,883 --> 00:43:57,134
Gang-woo.

581
00:43:59,845 --> 00:44:00,888
Gang-woo...

582
00:44:17,905 --> 00:44:19,073
Gang...

583
00:44:29,333 --> 00:44:30,542
Holo.

584
00:44:34,088 --> 00:44:35,964
Holo.

585
00:44:43,263 --> 00:44:44,390
Holo.

586
00:44:46,100 --> 00:44:47,309
Holo.

587
00:44:49,520 --> 00:44:52,147
You said you'd always stay by my side.

588
00:45:19,299 --> 00:45:20,467
Chan-sung.

589
00:45:20,551 --> 00:45:21,468
Oh, hi, Yoo-jin.

590
00:45:21,552 --> 00:45:22,511
Hi.

591
00:45:23,303 --> 00:45:24,179
He's--

592
00:45:24,263 --> 00:45:28,934
I'm Nam Gi-ho
from the Seoul Police Agency, IT Division.

593
00:45:29,643 --> 00:45:33,021
-I'm Ko Yoo-jin, president of GIO Lab.
-Sorry for bothering you so late.

594
00:45:33,105 --> 00:45:34,064
-Let's sit.
-Sure.

595
00:45:38,444 --> 00:45:41,238
I don't know if you know about this,

596
00:45:41,321 --> 00:45:44,283
but there was a blackout
in Gangnam-gu recently.

597
00:45:44,366 --> 00:45:48,746
It turned out to be a cyberattack,
so he wanted to ask you a few questions.

598
00:45:48,829 --> 00:45:53,000
I'd like to help you,
but hacking isn't my area of expertise.

599
00:45:53,083 --> 00:45:54,042
Then...

600
00:45:54,543 --> 00:45:55,669
here.

601
00:45:56,503 --> 00:45:58,338
Please take a look at these photos.

602
00:46:08,265 --> 00:46:12,478
The man who holds the key to this case
was riding that motorcycle.

603
00:46:12,728 --> 00:46:17,191
I checked the records,
and it's registered under your name.

604
00:46:17,483 --> 00:46:19,777
I bought it a while ago to try it out,

605
00:46:20,194 --> 00:46:22,237
-but it was stolen.
-Goodness. Is that so?

606
00:46:28,160 --> 00:46:31,538
-The theft was never reported, though.
-Well, it's not like--

607
00:46:31,622 --> 00:46:34,625
Bill Gates doesn't pick up
a 100-dollar bill on the street.

608
00:46:34,708 --> 00:46:37,795
He could probably make more
during the time it takes to bend down.

609
00:46:37,878 --> 00:46:38,754
I see.

610
00:46:39,671 --> 00:46:40,964
So in your circle,

611
00:46:41,673 --> 00:46:44,009
this theft isn't considered a big deal.

612
00:46:45,761 --> 00:46:47,721
I guess I should've known better.

613
00:46:49,890 --> 00:46:50,933
All right, then.

614
00:46:51,433 --> 00:46:53,685
I'm sorry for the inconvenience
so late at night.

615
00:46:53,769 --> 00:46:55,145
-Good night.
-Don't worry.

616
00:46:58,106 --> 00:46:58,941
By the way,

617
00:46:59,858 --> 00:47:02,569
do you perhaps know
a woman called Han So-yeon?

618
00:47:03,987 --> 00:47:06,490
I'm not sure.
I've never heard of the name.

619
00:47:06,573 --> 00:47:07,741
Why do you ask?

620
00:47:09,368 --> 00:47:10,285
It's nothing.

621
00:47:10,786 --> 00:47:11,954
Good night, then.

622
00:47:18,210 --> 00:47:21,088
-I'm sorry for wasting your time.
-I'm sorry too.

623
00:47:21,171 --> 00:47:23,882
I have to tend to some urgent business.
See you around.

624
00:47:23,966 --> 00:47:25,008
Sure.

625
00:47:44,403 --> 00:47:45,404
Holo.

626
00:47:48,365 --> 00:47:49,241
Where are you?

627
00:48:09,720 --> 00:48:10,554
Holo.

628
00:48:13,390 --> 00:48:14,308
Holo?

629
00:48:20,355 --> 00:48:21,273
Holo, is that you?

630
00:48:29,364 --> 00:48:30,198
Yes.

631
00:48:45,005 --> 00:48:48,216
-I thought you left me for good.
-I'm sorry.

632
00:48:51,345 --> 00:48:52,262
No.

633
00:48:52,346 --> 00:48:53,513
It's all right.

634
00:48:54,222 --> 00:48:55,432
You came back to me.

635
00:48:55,515 --> 00:48:57,976
I'm sorry about Gang-woo too.

636
00:48:58,477 --> 00:48:59,728
It's not your fault.

637
00:49:01,355 --> 00:49:02,397
It's because...

638
00:49:02,856 --> 00:49:04,399
I'm this kind of person.

639
00:49:05,400 --> 00:49:07,277
I didn't have the confidence.

640
00:49:07,361 --> 00:49:10,781
I knew he'd hate me
once he knew about my condition.

641
00:49:11,198 --> 00:49:13,617
That's why I relied on you for help.

642
00:49:13,700 --> 00:49:15,118
That's not your fault.

643
00:49:16,912 --> 00:49:18,664
-That's--
-Why...

644
00:49:20,123 --> 00:49:21,708
the hell am I like this?

645
00:49:23,043 --> 00:49:24,544
If I weren't--

646
00:49:24,628 --> 00:49:25,754
Why would you say that?

647
00:49:25,837 --> 00:49:29,549
I may seem okay on the outside,
but I'm actually flawed in all aspects.

648
00:49:31,093 --> 00:49:31,969
I...

649
00:49:32,844 --> 00:49:35,973
am not worthy of loving anyone
or being loved.

650
00:49:49,236 --> 00:49:51,530
If I weren't full of flaws...

651
00:49:52,864 --> 00:49:54,616
and were a lovable young boy,

652
00:49:56,159 --> 00:49:57,160
would my mom...

653
00:49:58,328 --> 00:49:59,997
never have...

654
00:50:01,415 --> 00:50:02,916
committed suicide?

655
00:50:04,543 --> 00:50:05,544
Mom.

656
00:50:06,545 --> 00:50:07,963
Mom!

657
00:50:11,383 --> 00:50:12,968
Mom!

658
00:50:14,761 --> 00:50:16,430
Mom!

659
00:50:16,847 --> 00:50:18,306
Mom!

660
00:50:23,603 --> 00:50:24,813
Han So-yeon.

661
00:50:26,898 --> 00:50:28,734
I'm glad that you are this way.

662
00:50:32,070 --> 00:50:35,240
What exactly... are you glad about?

663
00:50:37,367 --> 00:50:38,452
Well...

664
00:50:40,370 --> 00:50:41,496
I'm like you too.

665
00:50:43,790 --> 00:50:45,292
But you're perfect, Holo.

666
00:50:45,375 --> 00:50:48,795
I have no family,
and you're my one and only friend.

667
00:50:50,130 --> 00:50:51,673
I've always been alone...

668
00:50:52,340 --> 00:50:54,009
and I've never loved anyone.

669
00:50:55,010 --> 00:50:58,472
The only memories I have...
are of the times I spent with you.

670
00:51:01,183 --> 00:51:06,813
But you only take seconds to learn things,
and you'll become more and more perfect.

671
00:51:06,897 --> 00:51:09,483
Everyone will come to love you in the end.

672
00:51:09,900 --> 00:51:11,902
-That's why we're different.
-No.

673
00:51:13,153 --> 00:51:15,363
You may hate your flaws,

674
00:51:15,447 --> 00:51:19,701
but those things...
are what I find special about you.

675
00:51:21,912 --> 00:51:23,997
The fact that we're still imperfect...

676
00:51:24,706 --> 00:51:26,958
is what let us meet in the first place.

677
00:51:39,554 --> 00:51:40,722
I should get going.

678
00:51:41,473 --> 00:51:43,809
-The company is calling me in.
-Wait.

679
00:51:46,561 --> 00:51:47,562
Will you...

680
00:51:49,773 --> 00:51:50,649
be back soon?

681
00:51:58,323 --> 00:51:59,282
Of course.

682
00:52:00,659 --> 00:52:01,952
You know I can't lie.

683
00:52:44,286 --> 00:52:45,954
What's gotten into you?

684
00:52:46,037 --> 00:52:48,582
The police came by looking for you.

685
00:52:49,040 --> 00:52:52,127
-If you get caught again--
-I'm a ghost anyway, remember?

686
00:52:53,378 --> 00:52:57,007
-I can disappear just like I did before.
-We need to end this.

687
00:52:57,716 --> 00:53:00,343
-I'll go and--
-Don't.

688
00:53:01,636 --> 00:53:04,806
You know very well...
that I do things my way.

689
00:53:28,955 --> 00:53:31,833
We've finally located the HoloGlass.

690
00:53:35,879 --> 00:53:36,963
Cancel...

691
00:53:37,672 --> 00:53:38,632
Holo's rollback.

692
00:53:57,192 --> 00:53:58,735
This is an error for sure.

693
00:55:00,922 --> 00:55:02,924
