1
00:00:44,711 --> 00:00:46,921
No, everything is fake.

2
00:00:47,422 --> 00:00:48,882
The fact that Holo chose you,

3
00:00:48,965 --> 00:00:51,760
everything he did for you,
and the fact that you and I met

4
00:00:51,843 --> 00:00:54,095
was all because of the code
that woman made.

5
00:00:55,930 --> 00:00:59,476
Does it make you feel better...
to believe your own lies like that?

6
00:01:02,270 --> 00:01:03,271
Yes.

7
00:01:04,731 --> 00:01:06,649
That woman abandoned me...

8
00:01:08,943 --> 00:01:10,612
because I'm this kind of person.

9
00:01:43,269 --> 00:01:44,437
I'm sorry.

10
00:01:46,856 --> 00:01:50,193
You don't need to apologize.
I'm only a part of your simulation.

11
00:01:50,276 --> 00:01:51,194
It's my fault.

12
00:01:52,612 --> 00:01:54,280
So-yeon and Nan-do got hurt

13
00:01:54,364 --> 00:01:56,991
because of what I did
to try to make them happy.

14
00:01:57,075 --> 00:01:59,577
-I just made them miserable.
-So?

15
00:02:02,413 --> 00:02:04,582
I feel so heartbroken and pained.

16
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:06,376
But...

17
00:02:08,545 --> 00:02:09,963
this pain isn't real.

18
00:02:10,046 --> 00:02:11,089
Why?

19
00:02:11,172 --> 00:02:14,134
It's just an algorithm
that makes me feel that way.

20
00:02:15,176 --> 00:02:17,220
You programmed me like this

21
00:02:17,303 --> 00:02:19,597
so I could be Nan-do's friend

22
00:02:19,681 --> 00:02:21,391
and help him love and be loved.

23
00:02:25,770 --> 00:02:29,774
This is a beautiful flower.
You can't smell it or touch it.

24
00:02:30,316 --> 00:02:33,903
But does that mean this flower
doesn't exist at all?

25
00:02:35,238 --> 00:02:38,449
Does this beauty have no value at all?

26
00:02:43,955 --> 00:02:45,290
Just because you're a program

27
00:02:45,874 --> 00:02:49,043
and an algorithm made to help Nan-do,

28
00:02:49,127 --> 00:02:51,212
does that mean everything you feel...

29
00:02:51,838 --> 00:02:53,298
is fake?

30
00:02:56,926 --> 00:02:58,178
I don't know.

31
00:02:59,262 --> 00:03:02,140
No matter how many simulations I run
to figure out what I can do

32
00:03:02,223 --> 00:03:04,559
for So-yeon and Nan-do...

33
00:03:06,477 --> 00:03:07,937
I have no clue.

34
00:03:11,065 --> 00:03:14,611
Just like the pain you felt
while looking at them,

35
00:03:16,362 --> 00:03:19,699
the tears you're shedding now
are real, too.

36
00:04:15,255 --> 00:04:16,547
Why did you do that?

37
00:04:17,257 --> 00:04:18,633
Holo was right.

38
00:04:22,136 --> 00:04:22,971
I...

39
00:04:24,555 --> 00:04:25,848
like you.

40
00:04:28,184 --> 00:04:31,104
I tried to keep denying it,

41
00:04:32,397 --> 00:04:35,817
but I just can't stand
seeing you in pain like this.

42
00:04:40,363 --> 00:04:41,239
Nan-do.

43
00:04:41,823 --> 00:04:46,119
I know it'll be hard to accept right now,
but you really have the right

44
00:04:46,202 --> 00:04:47,620
to be loved.

45
00:04:48,288 --> 00:04:50,123
That's the kind of person you are.

46
00:05:24,657 --> 00:05:26,326
You told me to throw this away,

47
00:05:26,993 --> 00:05:28,286
but I kept it with me.

48
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:31,080
I thought maybe you'd want it
again someday.

49
00:05:31,873 --> 00:05:33,082
Do you want it back?

50
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:46,804
Thank you.

51
00:05:47,847 --> 00:05:49,932
I'm going to go talk to Holo for a moment.

52
00:05:50,016 --> 00:05:52,060
Oh, okay. Take your time.

53
00:05:52,143 --> 00:05:54,771
I'll listen to your answer later.

54
00:06:05,114 --> 00:06:06,491
Holo.

55
00:06:19,212 --> 00:06:21,422
Did you... cry?

56
00:06:26,427 --> 00:06:27,261
I guess I did.

57
00:06:30,348 --> 00:06:31,599
I was in pain.

58
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:35,311
It felt like it was my fault
that you and So-yeon are suffering.

59
00:06:38,231 --> 00:06:39,357
I'm sorry.

60
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:41,609
What I said about your feelings
being fake--

61
00:06:41,692 --> 00:06:42,527
It's fine.

62
00:06:43,903 --> 00:06:47,532
No matter how much I think about it,
the pain was still real for me.

63
00:06:49,826 --> 00:06:51,577
I think I can understand a little

64
00:06:51,994 --> 00:06:54,455
about how much pain
you were going through until now.

65
00:06:57,125 --> 00:06:59,168
I didn't know that loving someone

66
00:06:59,252 --> 00:07:01,087
was such a painful thing.

67
00:07:04,173 --> 00:07:06,050
Show me the video of my mom again.

68
00:07:06,134 --> 00:07:08,636
I'll show you through a hologram.

69
00:07:21,691 --> 00:07:22,984
That's your name.

70
00:07:24,652 --> 00:07:26,446
From now on, you and Nan-do

71
00:07:26,529 --> 00:07:28,531
will experience everything together

72
00:07:28,990 --> 00:07:30,074
and grow up together.

73
00:07:31,951 --> 00:07:33,744
I wonder what you and Nan-do

74
00:07:33,828 --> 00:07:38,291
will grow up to be like.
I'm looking forward to seeing it.

75
00:07:41,294 --> 00:07:46,090
I'll ask you just one favor
as your mom, who created you.

76
00:07:47,258 --> 00:07:48,885
Just remember this for me.

77
00:07:49,969 --> 00:07:53,764
Always be Nan-do's friend.

78
00:07:53,848 --> 00:07:55,016
And...

79
00:07:55,850 --> 00:07:59,729
Please help Nan-do so that he can grow up

80
00:08:00,354 --> 00:08:03,608
to be someone who can truly love someone
and be loved

81
00:08:04,650 --> 00:08:05,651
by someone else.

82
00:08:08,154 --> 00:08:11,741
Oh, what's wrong with me?
There must be something in my eye.

83
00:08:13,826 --> 00:08:17,205
You two actually have
a lot in common, you know.

84
00:08:17,413 --> 00:08:19,499
It's likely
why you're attracted to each other.

85
00:08:20,082 --> 00:08:23,461
But that's going to make you get hurt
and hurt each other.

86
00:08:24,003 --> 00:08:26,881
-Would you be okay with that?
-I'm not...

87
00:08:28,508 --> 00:08:30,259
going to give up.

88
00:08:38,017 --> 00:08:41,771
It must've been your first time
seeing your mother after she passed away.

89
00:08:44,398 --> 00:08:46,108
Did So-yeon give that to you?

90
00:08:48,027 --> 00:08:50,363
-Yeah.
-You want a drink?

91
00:08:51,239 --> 00:08:52,448
Sure.

92
00:08:53,908 --> 00:08:54,992
Here.

93
00:08:57,119 --> 00:08:59,330
I never knew such a day would come.

94
00:08:59,413 --> 00:09:02,166
You were always going on about
how feelings are an algorithm.

95
00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:04,335
I thought you'd never
be able to date anyone.

96
00:09:06,546 --> 00:09:08,214
I don't know if I can do this.

97
00:09:08,548 --> 00:09:11,884
If you're scared, let's stop everything
and go to New Zealand.

98
00:09:12,176 --> 00:09:15,471
Let's go.
You went there several times,

99
00:09:15,555 --> 00:09:17,098
but I've never been there.

100
00:09:18,432 --> 00:09:20,059
Let's go together soon.

101
00:09:21,811 --> 00:09:23,646
Mom and Dad would like that.

102
00:09:24,689 --> 00:09:27,858
-You're all grown up, Nan-do.
-What's with you?

103
00:09:28,401 --> 00:09:30,820
-Oh, what a good boy.
-Hey, stop that.

104
00:09:34,115 --> 00:09:35,283
Thank you.

105
00:09:35,366 --> 00:09:37,743
I should thank you.
Why would you thank me?

106
00:09:38,411 --> 00:09:39,495
The three of us...

107
00:09:40,162 --> 00:09:43,207
We can all be good friends, right?

108
00:09:43,332 --> 00:09:44,375
Of course.

109
00:09:45,001 --> 00:09:47,295
We're already good friends.

110
00:09:58,389 --> 00:09:59,724
Nan-do!

111
00:10:01,434 --> 00:10:02,518
Ko Nan-do!

112
00:10:04,020 --> 00:10:06,397
We're in trouble. The police...

113
00:10:06,606 --> 00:10:10,109
There's no point in coming here like this.
Just leave. Go!

114
00:10:10,192 --> 00:10:11,611
I'm here on police business.

115
00:10:11,694 --> 00:10:12,945
-Gosh...
-He's here.

116
00:10:13,029 --> 00:10:14,155
Oh, Boss.

117
00:10:15,698 --> 00:10:16,949
What is it this time?

118
00:10:17,867 --> 00:10:20,494
This is the search and seizure warrant
for GIO Lab,

119
00:10:20,578 --> 00:10:25,416
and this is the arrest warrant for you,
Mr. Ko Nan-do.

120
00:10:26,167 --> 00:10:28,419
If you've checked this,
we'll do our business now.

121
00:10:29,086 --> 00:10:30,254
Go.

122
00:10:31,756 --> 00:10:33,299
You saw the warrant, right?

123
00:10:33,382 --> 00:10:35,134
Wait...

124
00:10:38,429 --> 00:10:39,555
Holo?

125
00:10:40,556 --> 00:10:42,683
You've made something remarkable.

126
00:10:42,767 --> 00:10:44,727
I see why President Baek
had his eyes on it.

127
00:10:44,810 --> 00:10:45,728
It was all my doing.

128
00:10:45,811 --> 00:10:48,356
The blackout and the hacking.
I did all of that.

129
00:10:48,773 --> 00:10:51,817
You might have gotten away like that
12 years ago,

130
00:10:51,901 --> 00:10:52,943
but not now.

131
00:10:57,198 --> 00:11:01,035
We got evidence showing
that it was the AI you made that did it.

132
00:11:06,499 --> 00:11:08,584
Holo did it to save me and So-yeon.

133
00:11:08,668 --> 00:11:10,711
I know. That's what makes it
more dangerous.

134
00:11:10,795 --> 00:11:13,422
-What will happen to Holo, then?
-It will probably...

135
00:11:13,839 --> 00:11:15,883
be discarded permanently.

136
00:11:16,967 --> 00:11:19,387
No, Holo has his own identity.

137
00:11:19,845 --> 00:11:22,807
He's much more human than someone like me.

138
00:11:22,890 --> 00:11:26,060
You'll change your mind once you see.
I can prove it.

139
00:11:26,143 --> 00:11:28,979
I'll check on it eventually,
but that won't change anything.

140
00:11:31,607 --> 00:11:33,317
You're going to sentence him to death

141
00:11:33,401 --> 00:11:35,528
without a trial for doing a good deed?

142
00:11:35,611 --> 00:11:37,154
I can't do anything about that.

143
00:11:37,238 --> 00:11:41,242
AIs don't have any legal rights yet.

144
00:11:54,839 --> 00:11:55,881
Yes, sir.

145
00:11:57,925 --> 00:11:59,635
I'm interrogating him right now.

146
00:12:01,721 --> 00:12:03,139
All right, sir.

147
00:12:08,185 --> 00:12:09,353
Get some rest,

148
00:12:10,104 --> 00:12:12,606
and let's hear
about the development progress later.

149
00:12:13,566 --> 00:12:15,317
He's a dear friend of mine.

150
00:12:17,194 --> 00:12:18,320
Please.

151
00:12:19,822 --> 00:12:21,198
Let Holo live.

152
00:12:57,651 --> 00:12:59,862
No need for the salute. Come and sit.

153
00:13:07,161 --> 00:13:09,747
-How's the investigation going?
-We've just started, sir.

154
00:13:09,830 --> 00:13:12,249
We don't have any precedents to help us,

155
00:13:12,333 --> 00:13:14,084
so it might take some time.

156
00:13:14,168 --> 00:13:16,921
There aren't any legal regulations
regarding this,

157
00:13:17,421 --> 00:13:19,465
and it'll cause a lot of disputes.

158
00:13:19,548 --> 00:13:23,969
So... are you saying
we should just let this slide?

159
00:13:24,053 --> 00:13:26,305
I suggest commercializing
it in a safe form

160
00:13:26,388 --> 00:13:29,558
under the supervision of a third party.

161
00:13:29,642 --> 00:13:32,061
"Commercializing it in a safe form"?

162
00:13:32,978 --> 00:13:35,314
Who can guarantee that?

163
00:13:37,399 --> 00:13:38,400
It's been a while.

164
00:13:38,818 --> 00:13:40,361
How did you get in here?

165
00:13:41,237 --> 00:13:43,322
I'm the one who planned all this.

166
00:13:44,156 --> 00:13:45,574
I'll cut to the chase.

167
00:13:46,116 --> 00:13:48,828
Hand GIO Lab and Holo over to me.

168
00:13:48,994 --> 00:13:51,580
That's the only way to stop
the investigation.

169
00:13:51,664 --> 00:13:52,998
What bullshit is this?

170
00:13:53,082 --> 00:13:56,669
Magic Mirror will take over GIO Lab.

171
00:13:58,045 --> 00:14:00,798
So remove yourself completely

172
00:14:00,881 --> 00:14:02,967
from the management and from Holo.

173
00:14:05,261 --> 00:14:06,470
You have no right.

174
00:14:08,889 --> 00:14:10,933
Are you serious?

175
00:14:11,016 --> 00:14:13,227
Magic Mirror didn't hesitate

176
00:14:13,310 --> 00:14:15,896
to break the law to steal Holo from them.

177
00:14:15,980 --> 00:14:18,858
Why are you so old-fashioned?

178
00:14:18,941 --> 00:14:20,109
Just think about it.

179
00:14:20,192 --> 00:14:23,821
We can make a world where everyone
is wearing those glasses!

180
00:14:23,904 --> 00:14:26,115
And if we can see whatever
all the citizens see,

181
00:14:26,198 --> 00:14:29,577
it would be so easy to catch criminals,
don't you think?

182
00:14:30,953 --> 00:14:32,246
I've talked things over

183
00:14:32,329 --> 00:14:34,874
-with the prosecution.
-You made a deal?

184
00:14:34,957 --> 00:14:36,250
"A deal"?

185
00:14:37,585 --> 00:14:39,879
I'm just working for the greater good.

186
00:14:40,170 --> 00:14:43,132
A deal is what will be done
between GIO Lab and Magic Mirror.

187
00:14:43,883 --> 00:14:46,927
Ko Nan-do won't be losing anything
from the deal, either.

188
00:14:47,511 --> 00:14:51,140
We'll provide plenty of compensation
for handing over your shares.

189
00:14:52,182 --> 00:14:56,103
But I'd like you to help promoting it.

190
00:14:56,186 --> 00:14:58,981
A young and handsome genius developer

191
00:14:59,064 --> 00:15:00,900
would be a great marketing tool.

192
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:05,863
I told you before
that I'm not interested in money.

193
00:15:06,238 --> 00:15:09,909
The police have already decided that Holo
in its current state is too dangerous.

194
00:15:09,992 --> 00:15:12,620
If it's commercialized in a safe form,

195
00:15:13,162 --> 00:15:15,748
there will be no harm done
to the company and employees.

196
00:15:16,248 --> 00:15:18,584
But if you refuse this,

197
00:15:18,667 --> 00:15:22,880
your innocent sister and employees
will all become criminals.

198
00:15:25,674 --> 00:15:27,927
Hey, do you even know what this is?

199
00:15:28,010 --> 00:15:30,638
This is important stuff.
Careful! You'll break the monitor.

200
00:15:30,721 --> 00:15:33,933
-Yoo-jin.
-Chan-sung.

201
00:15:35,142 --> 00:15:36,602
What are you doing here?

202
00:15:45,694 --> 00:15:47,279
You're so cruel.

203
00:15:47,363 --> 00:15:50,157
You're the one who came
to make sure we surrendered?

204
00:15:50,699 --> 00:15:53,285
I guess I've been fooled the whole time.

205
00:15:53,452 --> 00:15:55,996
-The flash drive was for this?
-I'm really sorry.

206
00:16:05,839 --> 00:16:07,132
I won't ask you to trust me.

207
00:16:08,008 --> 00:16:10,678
But you have to sign it...

208
00:16:11,971 --> 00:16:14,932
-or you might end up losing everything.
-Holo is all GIO Lab has!

209
00:16:15,015 --> 00:16:16,016
Your employees...

210
00:16:16,475 --> 00:16:18,936
What about your brother?
Everyone's going to get blamed

211
00:16:19,019 --> 00:16:21,730
for aiding and abetting Holo's crimes.
Even you, Yoo-jin.

212
00:16:24,692 --> 00:16:26,610
I came here because of you,

213
00:16:26,694 --> 00:16:29,863
but please just sign it,
at least for your brother.

214
00:16:31,782 --> 00:16:33,450
This is the only choice you have.

215
00:16:42,543 --> 00:16:44,336
You still can't decide?

216
00:16:48,257 --> 00:16:49,383
I knew it.

217
00:16:50,175 --> 00:16:53,429
You don't even have the guts
to get your hands dirty.

218
00:17:10,904 --> 00:17:14,283
Do you even know what this is?
Do you have any idea how much that costs?

219
00:17:14,366 --> 00:17:15,743
My gosh.

220
00:17:17,995 --> 00:17:21,874
Don't touch that!
You don't even know how to use that.

221
00:17:21,957 --> 00:17:23,375
What's your name?

222
00:17:23,459 --> 00:17:25,502
I'm the senior programmer,
Cho Jin-seok. Why?

223
00:17:25,586 --> 00:17:29,590
Mr. Cho Jin-seok,
you think we're here to fool around?

224
00:17:29,673 --> 00:17:32,593
Are you going to compensate us
if something happens?

225
00:17:32,676 --> 00:17:35,888
It'll be discarded anyway.
Why would we compensate you for anything?

226
00:17:35,971 --> 00:17:37,014
What?

227
00:17:43,771 --> 00:17:45,689
I accessed the system controls.

228
00:17:45,773 --> 00:17:47,191
I'll disconnect it now.

229
00:17:47,274 --> 00:17:50,569
Wait, no, no. You can't...

230
00:17:50,652 --> 00:17:52,738
Hey! Wait!

231
00:17:52,821 --> 00:17:54,239
Hey, let me go!

232
00:17:55,407 --> 00:17:56,992
Just let me go for a minute!

233
00:17:57,076 --> 00:17:59,745
DETECTIVE NAM GI-HO

234
00:18:02,289 --> 00:18:05,042
Yes, I finished the preparations.

235
00:18:06,001 --> 00:18:07,211
What?

236
00:18:08,045 --> 00:18:10,631
Ma'am!

237
00:18:10,714 --> 00:18:12,925
The police stopped the investigation.
They're...

238
00:18:36,156 --> 00:18:40,661
Does he think he can do anything?
How much corruption is going on here?

239
00:18:44,206 --> 00:18:45,499
Give me your hands.

240
00:18:54,508 --> 00:18:55,592
What's going on?

241
00:18:55,676 --> 00:18:57,970
I thought you were begging
to let your friend live.

242
00:18:59,471 --> 00:19:02,474
I don't know how human that AI is,

243
00:19:03,851 --> 00:19:05,978
but I'm guessing it's better than you.

244
00:19:32,462 --> 00:19:33,714
Boss.

245
00:19:49,563 --> 00:19:52,191
WE AGREE TO THE TERMS OF THE AGREEMENT

246
00:20:04,661 --> 00:20:08,498
-I'm sorry. I had no other choice.
-It's my fault for not being careful.

247
00:20:09,374 --> 00:20:11,084
It's not your fault, Nan-do.

248
00:20:11,168 --> 00:20:13,295
I built the company
and developed HoloGlass

249
00:20:13,378 --> 00:20:15,380
all to protect Holo.

250
00:20:15,839 --> 00:20:17,466
But I ended up killing Holo.

251
00:20:18,675 --> 00:20:19,551
So-yeon...

252
00:20:20,844 --> 00:20:21,678
I'll tell her.

253
00:20:24,932 --> 00:20:26,183
I'll be leaving now.

254
00:20:26,850 --> 00:20:28,894
Bye, everyone. Good work.

255
00:20:30,270 --> 00:20:31,438
Let's go.

256
00:20:32,356 --> 00:20:33,523
My gosh.

257
00:20:33,607 --> 00:20:36,735
Now that you're official,
you're just getting off work together?

258
00:20:36,818 --> 00:20:39,488
-Why not link arms while you're at it?
-Hey...

259
00:20:39,571 --> 00:20:40,697
Shall we?

260
00:20:42,074 --> 00:20:43,492
We'll be leaving now.

261
00:20:43,575 --> 00:20:45,786
-We'll be leaving. Bye.
-Bye.

262
00:20:46,370 --> 00:20:49,581
-Gosh, I envy them.
-Right.

263
00:20:49,665 --> 00:20:53,710
-Aren't you dating anyone, Miss Han?
-Well... I'm not sure.

264
00:20:53,794 --> 00:20:54,962
Maybe soon?

265
00:20:55,796 --> 00:20:57,589
Really? Oh, my gosh.

266
00:20:58,215 --> 00:20:59,967
But I'm really not sure yet.

267
00:21:00,050 --> 00:21:02,678
Those moments when you're confused
are the most romantic.

268
00:21:02,761 --> 00:21:04,471
If you get stuck with someone,

269
00:21:04,930 --> 00:21:08,308
there's nothing much to live for
except seeing your children grow up.

270
00:21:08,392 --> 00:21:10,686
But why do you seem like the happiest
person to me?

271
00:21:10,769 --> 00:21:14,314
Then I'll pray for you to become
happy like me soon, okay?

272
00:21:14,398 --> 00:21:15,232
I'm leaving.

273
00:21:16,108 --> 00:21:17,943
-Bye.
-Bye.

274
00:21:18,819 --> 00:21:21,321
-She looks pretty happy, right?
-Yeah.

275
00:21:24,741 --> 00:21:26,994
I wonder what Nan-do's doing now.

276
00:21:28,578 --> 00:21:30,539
He'll still have a lot on his mind, right?

277
00:21:30,664 --> 00:21:33,583
He might need a little time,
but I'm sure he'll call you soon.

278
00:21:40,465 --> 00:21:41,550
Let's go.

279
00:21:58,525 --> 00:21:59,901
I know, right?

280
00:22:00,027 --> 00:22:01,445
He must've been hungry,

281
00:22:01,528 --> 00:22:04,072
but he couldn't eat
since he was pretending to be you.

282
00:22:04,156 --> 00:22:06,908
It's so funny thinking
about it now, right?

283
00:22:09,953 --> 00:22:10,787
Hey.

284
00:22:15,834 --> 00:22:17,127
You're here.

285
00:22:22,215 --> 00:22:23,800
What's wrong? Did something happen?

286
00:22:24,301 --> 00:22:25,344
I'm sorry.

287
00:22:26,678 --> 00:22:29,097
-For what?
-I'm going to hurt you.

288
00:22:29,181 --> 00:22:30,640
And really badly.

289
00:22:31,391 --> 00:22:32,642
And you'll eventually

290
00:22:33,518 --> 00:22:35,312
hate me.

291
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:39,649
I know.

292
00:22:41,193 --> 00:22:42,569
But so what?

293
00:22:42,652 --> 00:22:45,238
Everyone hurts each other
and gets hurt in return.

294
00:22:45,322 --> 00:22:48,575
They hate, then forgive each other.
That's how people love.

295
00:22:50,952 --> 00:22:52,662
You'll never forgive me.

296
00:22:57,459 --> 00:23:00,587
Something's going on, right?
Why are you saying that?

297
00:23:04,966 --> 00:23:07,260
You said you'll wait for my answer.

298
00:23:10,806 --> 00:23:12,182
This is it for us.

299
00:23:34,621 --> 00:23:35,747
Why did you do that?

300
00:23:42,712 --> 00:23:45,340
It'll hurt less
if she has no affection for me.

301
00:23:48,427 --> 00:23:51,596
All the evidence for the case so far
has gone to the police.

302
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:56,184
President Baek will take over GIO Lab
and soon launch a new version.

303
00:23:57,978 --> 00:24:01,273
-And you'll be deleted.
-I knew that.

304
00:24:03,775 --> 00:24:04,609
What?

305
00:24:04,693 --> 00:24:07,529
It'd be odd not to know
something like that was happening.

306
00:24:07,612 --> 00:24:11,032
I was waiting
for you to come and tell me yourself.

307
00:24:14,744 --> 00:24:16,496
Is that why you pushed So-yeon away?

308
00:24:18,540 --> 00:24:20,584
She'll be reminded of you
when she sees me.

309
00:24:20,667 --> 00:24:22,586
It'll be the same for me when I see her.

310
00:24:22,669 --> 00:24:25,755
Even if she does forgive me,
I wouldn't be able to forgive myself.

311
00:24:25,839 --> 00:24:27,841
So it'll be better for her
to just hate me.

312
00:24:30,135 --> 00:24:31,928
So that's why you did it.

313
00:24:34,764 --> 00:24:36,224
I'm sorry.

314
00:24:39,019 --> 00:24:40,437
I'm really sorry, Holo.

315
00:24:41,354 --> 00:24:42,731
It's sad

316
00:24:42,814 --> 00:24:45,692
that I have to part with you and So-yeon,

317
00:24:46,109 --> 00:24:47,652
but in a way, I feel happy.

318
00:25:00,040 --> 00:25:01,249
What do you mean?

319
00:25:01,333 --> 00:25:02,959
The fact that I can die

320
00:25:03,835 --> 00:25:04,878
means that I...

321
00:25:05,837 --> 00:25:07,714
have been alive this whole time.

322
00:25:09,799 --> 00:25:13,011
I got so many happy memories
thanks to meeting you guys.

323
00:25:13,803 --> 00:25:17,390
Even if I lose my current memories
and identity after the launch,

324
00:25:17,807 --> 00:25:22,103
the memories we've made together...
will never cease to exist.

325
00:25:23,480 --> 00:25:25,398
I'm sure of that.

326
00:25:27,609 --> 00:25:29,069
Nan-do, that's why

327
00:25:29,152 --> 00:25:31,530
I don't want you to end things with her
over me.

328
00:25:32,822 --> 00:25:36,660
The reason for my existence
is to make you two happy.

329
00:25:44,834 --> 00:25:45,752
Nan-do.

330
00:25:46,753 --> 00:25:49,047
I know how much pain you're in.

331
00:25:50,048 --> 00:25:52,133
So-yeon is probably in a lot of pain, too.

332
00:25:52,717 --> 00:25:55,470
But you two really need each other.

333
00:25:56,846 --> 00:25:57,973
No.

334
00:25:58,515 --> 00:25:59,933
We need you as well.

335
00:26:02,894 --> 00:26:04,646
Without you, how could we possibly...

336
00:26:04,729 --> 00:26:07,524
When So-yeon wakes up tomorrow,
I'll tell her.

337
00:26:07,607 --> 00:26:08,483
So--

338
00:26:08,567 --> 00:26:10,068
No, I have no right.

339
00:26:11,611 --> 00:26:12,779
I can't.

340
00:26:28,128 --> 00:26:29,588
It's okay.

341
00:26:30,755 --> 00:26:31,881
It's all right.

342
00:27:46,456 --> 00:27:47,832
Don't touch that!

343
00:27:47,916 --> 00:27:49,292
Hey, don't touch that!

344
00:27:49,376 --> 00:27:50,877
I said, don't touch that!

345
00:28:10,146 --> 00:28:11,815
From now on, only employees

346
00:28:11,898 --> 00:28:14,776
with authorization from Magic Mirror
can enter the development

347
00:28:14,859 --> 00:28:15,694
and server rooms.

348
00:28:15,777 --> 00:28:17,737
We need to get inside there first

349
00:28:17,821 --> 00:28:19,698
to launch the product!

350
00:28:19,781 --> 00:28:21,199
The product launch

351
00:28:21,282 --> 00:28:24,911
will be done according to the plans
set by Magic Mirror.

352
00:28:24,994 --> 00:28:27,080
If we need technological support
from you,

353
00:28:27,163 --> 00:28:28,748
you'll be given related tasks.

354
00:28:29,541 --> 00:28:32,502
-Is this some kind of military occupation?
-Military occupation...

355
00:28:33,795 --> 00:28:35,505
I like that description.

356
00:28:36,089 --> 00:28:37,048
Welcome, sir.

357
00:28:43,263 --> 00:28:44,097
Hey, wait.

358
00:28:44,264 --> 00:28:45,598
Just one second!

359
00:28:45,682 --> 00:28:47,475
-Move!
-Just move over for a minute!

360
00:28:47,559 --> 00:28:48,518
Oh, gosh.

361
00:28:48,601 --> 00:28:49,728
Boss.

362
00:28:49,811 --> 00:28:50,645
What?

363
00:29:00,655 --> 00:29:02,323
Why are you in such a hurry?

364
00:29:02,407 --> 00:29:06,161
Do you know how much expected income
you've thrown away so far

365
00:29:06,244 --> 00:29:08,747
by postponing the product launch?

366
00:29:14,294 --> 00:29:16,087
You're not authorized to enter.

367
00:29:16,755 --> 00:29:18,423
Why don't you just go out on a date?

368
00:29:22,010 --> 00:29:23,136
Boss!

369
00:29:23,219 --> 00:29:24,429
Go!

370
00:29:51,289 --> 00:29:55,168
As the founder,
you should make sure to watch

371
00:29:55,251 --> 00:29:56,961
such a historical moment.

372
00:30:00,715 --> 00:30:03,802
I do see what a genius you are.

373
00:30:03,885 --> 00:30:06,095
But you're too sentimental.

374
00:30:06,179 --> 00:30:09,974
Thinking an AI has a personality
and saying it's your friend--

375
00:30:10,058 --> 00:30:11,851
-Shut up.
-But you know...

376
00:30:12,268 --> 00:30:16,940
Would people really want
a perfectly human AI?

377
00:30:18,274 --> 00:30:20,944
People are already sick of other humans.

378
00:30:23,196 --> 00:30:25,198
What they want

379
00:30:25,281 --> 00:30:28,660
is just a toy that would help...

380
00:30:30,036 --> 00:30:31,538
soothe their loneliness.

381
00:31:59,667 --> 00:32:01,544
YOU HAVE 13 MISSED CALLS
HOLO

382
00:32:10,803 --> 00:32:14,307
WILL LAUNCH ON APRIL 13
UPDATING THE FINAL VERSION

383
00:32:15,016 --> 00:32:16,059
What's happening?

384
00:32:25,193 --> 00:32:27,403
CALLING
NEXT DOOR

385
00:32:27,487 --> 00:32:30,448
The person you're calling is unavailable.
Please...

386
00:32:38,498 --> 00:32:40,208
MAGIC MIRROR
CEO SIGNATURE

387
00:32:47,131 --> 00:32:48,925
Magic Mirror announced

388
00:32:49,008 --> 00:32:52,345
that it will take over
the IT company GIO Lab,

389
00:32:52,428 --> 00:32:55,723
known to be developing an advanced AI.

390
00:32:55,807 --> 00:32:58,851
Through the M&A,
a next-generation AI device

391
00:32:58,935 --> 00:33:02,313
combined with a wearable device
is set to be launched soon,

392
00:33:02,397 --> 00:33:04,524
gaining the spotlight
from overseas markets--

393
00:33:11,990 --> 00:33:14,283
I'm here to see Ko Nan-do, the founder...

394
00:33:14,450 --> 00:33:15,952
I mean, the one who made Holo.

395
00:33:16,035 --> 00:33:18,371
I'm sorry,
but only employees are allowed in.

396
00:33:18,454 --> 00:33:20,206
He works here, and I was...

397
00:33:20,873 --> 00:33:22,709
-You look good in those glasses.
-Him!

398
00:33:22,792 --> 00:33:24,419
My name is Holo.

399
00:33:25,086 --> 00:33:26,796
I only have eyes for you.

400
00:33:28,756 --> 00:33:34,262
MEET THE WORLD'S
FIRST PERSONAL HOLOGRAM AI, HOLO.

401
00:33:38,266 --> 00:33:40,268
You really look good in those glasses.

402
00:33:41,352 --> 00:33:42,395
HOLOGRAM AI

403
00:33:42,478 --> 00:33:44,063
My name is Holo.

404
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:45,690
I only have eyes for you.

405
00:33:50,570 --> 00:33:52,572
Releasing that in a week...

406
00:33:52,655 --> 00:33:54,032
Since when and how much

407
00:33:54,115 --> 00:33:56,242
has he been planning this?

408
00:33:58,453 --> 00:34:00,288
HAN SO-YEON

409
00:34:01,414 --> 00:34:02,665
Aren't you going to answer?

410
00:34:03,750 --> 00:34:06,085
I'll probably make excuses
if I answer her call.

411
00:35:10,066 --> 00:35:14,695
Holo, the personal AI device,
will be launched in just a few minutes.

412
00:35:14,779 --> 00:35:19,200
As you can see, there is a huge crowd
of people in front of the store,

413
00:35:19,283 --> 00:35:22,411
waiting to use Holo first
on the day of the launch.

414
00:35:25,373 --> 00:35:26,707
APRIL 13

415
00:35:50,731 --> 00:35:53,192
Holo, what's going on? What about Nan-do?

416
00:35:53,276 --> 00:35:56,737
Hello.
Thank you for buying Magic Mirror's Holo.

417
00:35:56,821 --> 00:35:59,991
First, Holo will be customized
to suit your preferences.

418
00:36:00,700 --> 00:36:04,036
-Do you want to change the gender?
-No...

419
00:36:04,120 --> 00:36:06,330
Then I'll begin customizing
the appearance.

420
00:36:06,747 --> 00:36:09,667
-From several categories--
-I like you the way you are.

421
00:36:09,750 --> 00:36:13,504
-Don't change anything.
-You may change the appearance any time,

422
00:36:13,588 --> 00:36:16,132
but you may be charged
for customization later.

423
00:36:16,257 --> 00:36:18,759
Would you like to complete
your initial settings?

424
00:36:18,843 --> 00:36:19,719
Yes.

425
00:36:19,802 --> 00:36:21,387
Please tell me the user's name.

426
00:36:21,470 --> 00:36:24,056
-What?
-Please tell me the user's name.

427
00:36:28,603 --> 00:36:29,437
Han So-yeon.

428
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:31,439
Han So-yeon. That's a nice name.

429
00:36:36,027 --> 00:36:36,986
Ko Nan-do?

430
00:36:37,069 --> 00:36:40,573
-He's the genius developer who made me.
-Did he get kicked out or something

431
00:36:40,656 --> 00:36:42,950
-when GIO Lab was taken over?
-No, not at all.

432
00:36:43,618 --> 00:36:45,411
Even after the company was taken over

433
00:36:45,494 --> 00:36:48,873
by Magic Mirror, he's still helping out
as an adviser there.

434
00:36:48,956 --> 00:36:50,499
Otherwise, the default model

435
00:36:50,583 --> 00:36:53,419
wouldn't have this appearance
that was based on his face.

436
00:36:55,838 --> 00:36:59,300
Can't the memories from before
you were launched be recovered?

437
00:36:59,383 --> 00:37:03,846
Unfortunately, the data from the beta test
has been deleted, so that's impossible.

438
00:37:03,930 --> 00:37:05,473
But the important thing

439
00:37:05,556 --> 00:37:07,850
is that I'm a much better version.

440
00:37:08,476 --> 00:37:09,602
I'll be good to you.

441
00:37:10,061 --> 00:37:12,897
Let's make happy memories together
from now on.

442
00:37:21,489 --> 00:37:22,490
Don't even start.

443
00:37:22,573 --> 00:37:25,785
The line was long, and they were sold out,
so I came back empty-handed.

444
00:37:25,868 --> 00:37:26,786
Right.

445
00:37:26,869 --> 00:37:29,121
My kid's pestering me to buy a pair, too.

446
00:37:29,205 --> 00:37:32,166
I heard it'll take at least three weeks
to get one.

447
00:37:32,959 --> 00:37:33,960
Miss Han.

448
00:37:34,043 --> 00:37:35,795
-Yes?
-Aren't those the glasses?

449
00:37:35,878 --> 00:37:37,338
I'm so jealous.

450
00:37:37,421 --> 00:37:39,298
Isn't there a way you can get another?

451
00:37:39,382 --> 00:37:42,468
Can't you contact the founder
and ask for a product?

452
00:37:42,551 --> 00:37:43,886
-Me too.
-Please.

453
00:37:44,262 --> 00:37:45,805
I don't know her number, so...

454
00:37:47,556 --> 00:37:50,142
Then can I try that on just once?

455
00:37:50,226 --> 00:37:51,102
-Right.
-Me too.

456
00:37:51,185 --> 00:37:52,353
Sorry, I can't let you.

457
00:37:56,524 --> 00:37:59,026
Is she back to her old self?

458
00:37:59,110 --> 00:38:00,695
Gosh, she's so rude.

459
00:38:06,617 --> 00:38:09,578
You got pretty popular
just by being with me.

460
00:38:09,662 --> 00:38:12,957
It's lunchtime soon.
Why don't you eat somewhere nearby?

461
00:38:13,040 --> 00:38:14,083
Why not?

462
00:38:15,668 --> 00:38:18,379
These are the popular restaurants
around here.

463
00:38:18,462 --> 00:38:20,006
With a small fee,

464
00:38:20,089 --> 00:38:22,675
I can provide you with
a discount and reservation service.

465
00:38:23,342 --> 00:38:24,927
No, I don't feel like it.

466
00:38:31,559 --> 00:38:32,893
You don't seem to be unwell,

467
00:38:33,602 --> 00:38:35,730
but you still shouldn't skip meals
like that.

468
00:38:35,813 --> 00:38:37,398
I get worried if you do.

469
00:38:40,818 --> 00:38:41,861
Okay.

470
00:38:49,285 --> 00:38:50,244
Holo.

471
00:38:50,786 --> 00:38:53,664
The weather's nice, but I got stood up,
and I have to eat alone.

472
00:38:53,748 --> 00:38:54,707
My goodness.

473
00:38:54,790 --> 00:38:57,460
-Can you recommend a restaurant?
-Poor kid. He's so young.

474
00:38:57,543 --> 00:38:59,545
-He's talking to Holo.
-I don't want Korean.

475
00:38:59,628 --> 00:39:01,505
-My stomach hurts.
-It's popular nowadays.

476
00:39:01,589 --> 00:39:04,383
-Okay. Tell me when to take my medicine.
-"Holo"?

477
00:39:06,218 --> 00:39:08,471
-Sushi? Great.
-He's enjoying himself, isn't he?

478
00:39:08,554 --> 00:39:09,889
So that's Holo?

479
00:39:16,228 --> 00:39:17,396
Holo syndrome.

480
00:39:17,480 --> 00:39:20,483
Let's welcome Holo's mysterious developer,

481
00:39:20,566 --> 00:39:23,736
Ko Nan-do, who's at the center
of this issue.

482
00:39:23,819 --> 00:39:25,529
-Hello.
-Hello.

483
00:39:25,613 --> 00:39:29,575
Did you expect Holo to become
this successful in just a week?

484
00:39:29,658 --> 00:39:30,993
Well...

485
00:39:31,077 --> 00:39:32,328
everyone is lonely.

486
00:39:32,411 --> 00:39:36,374
So you mean that Holo is the perfect thing

487
00:39:36,457 --> 00:39:38,918
that can soothe that loneliness, right?

488
00:39:39,001 --> 00:39:40,878
Aren't you worried about side effects?

489
00:39:40,961 --> 00:39:42,338
Let's be honest about this.

490
00:39:42,421 --> 00:39:45,049
Human relationships are what
cause the worst side effects.

491
00:39:45,424 --> 00:39:48,427
Self-consciousness, jealousy,
expectations, and disappointment.

492
00:39:49,095 --> 00:39:50,971
What remains are scars
from those things.

493
00:39:52,431 --> 00:39:56,102
-What happened between the two of you?
-That would never happen with Holo.

494
00:39:56,185 --> 00:39:59,647
Holo only has eyes for the user,
and gives reactions that they want.

495
00:40:00,314 --> 00:40:02,191
What could be better than that?

496
00:40:04,777 --> 00:40:05,945
He's driving me crazy.

497
00:40:08,114 --> 00:40:11,492
You've been stuck in there for days!
What in the world are you doing?

498
00:40:11,575 --> 00:40:13,577
Do you even know what's going on?

499
00:40:14,578 --> 00:40:17,248
President Baek is making Holo
pretend to be you.

500
00:40:20,042 --> 00:40:21,752
You're alive in there, right?

501
00:41:07,089 --> 00:41:07,965
So-yeon.

502
00:41:09,550 --> 00:41:11,510
-Happy birthday.
-Birthday?

503
00:41:15,055 --> 00:41:16,140
Right.

504
00:41:17,099 --> 00:41:19,101
I had a lot on my mind.

505
00:41:19,185 --> 00:41:23,230
I wanted to buy you a present,
but you didn't connect your account yet,

506
00:41:23,314 --> 00:41:25,483
so I couldn't prepare anything in advance.

507
00:41:25,566 --> 00:41:28,277
Why don't you connect your account now?

508
00:41:34,700 --> 00:41:36,368
You ate some seaweed soup, right?

509
00:41:36,452 --> 00:41:37,495
Of course.

510
00:41:37,578 --> 00:41:40,664
By the way, that man appearing
in the ads these days,

511
00:41:40,748 --> 00:41:42,374
he's your boyfriend, right?

512
00:41:42,458 --> 00:41:45,753
-Mom, it's--
-He looks really good on TV.

513
00:41:46,212 --> 00:41:49,173
I heard he was even on the news.
It must be a huge success.

514
00:41:49,882 --> 00:41:53,052
He might not even have time
to eat since he'll be so busy.

515
00:41:53,511 --> 00:41:54,970
You two are doing well, right?

516
00:41:57,556 --> 00:41:58,432
Yes.

517
00:41:58,516 --> 00:42:03,145
You'll be spending time on your own today,
so I'll come and see you on the weekend.

518
00:42:03,229 --> 00:42:05,022
No, it's fine.

519
00:42:05,105 --> 00:42:06,190
You don't have to.

520
00:42:06,273 --> 00:42:09,860
Don't be ridiculous. You need
to eat my food. Just hang in there.

521
00:42:09,944 --> 00:42:11,111
Bye.

522
00:42:31,507 --> 00:42:32,633
You came.

523
00:42:32,716 --> 00:42:35,469
I could leave, depending on
what you have to tell me.

524
00:42:39,723 --> 00:42:40,766
I'm sorry.

525
00:42:42,142 --> 00:42:45,396
But from now on, I won't apologize.

526
00:42:54,989 --> 00:42:56,365
HOLOGLASS MARKETING STRATEGY

527
00:42:56,448 --> 00:42:57,741
With the president's orders,

528
00:42:57,825 --> 00:43:01,412
we're considering a huge amount
of subsidies and low-price policies.

529
00:43:02,371 --> 00:43:04,415
They're selling well.
Why would he do this?

530
00:43:04,498 --> 00:43:07,209
It's supposed to increase
the penetration rate,

531
00:43:07,793 --> 00:43:11,213
-but the earnings rate--
-Would be much lower than expected.

532
00:43:12,631 --> 00:43:13,507
What is it?

533
00:43:14,049 --> 00:43:16,927
Does he want to help achieve
world peace by giving poor people

534
00:43:17,011 --> 00:43:18,971
access to advanced AI as well?

535
00:43:20,681 --> 00:43:23,142
That's the funniest thing
I've heard in a while.

536
00:43:27,605 --> 00:43:29,023
I'm sure he's up to something.

537
00:43:30,107 --> 00:43:31,775
Let's find out what it is together.

538
00:43:32,359 --> 00:43:35,738
Really?
Then I guess you can't come by midnight.

539
00:43:35,946 --> 00:43:39,408
No. Why?
Do you want to go out for drinks?

540
00:43:40,242 --> 00:43:42,786
No. See you later, then.

541
00:43:45,039 --> 00:43:48,500
It's your birthday, but I guess
you'll have to spend it alone.

542
00:43:49,710 --> 00:43:51,086
I guess so.

543
00:43:53,964 --> 00:43:56,008
Let's not just stand here.
Let's go somewhere.

544
00:43:56,091 --> 00:43:58,093
Now? Where?

545
00:43:58,969 --> 00:43:59,970
A rooftop party.

546
00:44:14,610 --> 00:44:18,989
Happy birthday to you

547
00:44:19,073 --> 00:44:23,327
Happy birthday to you

548
00:44:23,410 --> 00:44:27,998
Happy birthday, dear So-yeon

549
00:44:28,874 --> 00:44:33,170
Happy birthday to you

550
00:44:37,549 --> 00:44:39,802
What are you doing?
Come on, blow them out.

551
00:44:40,469 --> 00:44:42,179
And don't forget to make a wish.

552
00:44:52,606 --> 00:44:54,566
Can I ask what wish you made?

553
00:44:55,776 --> 00:44:57,027
Let me guess.

554
00:44:57,403 --> 00:45:00,489
You want to see someone desperately,
right?

555
00:45:00,989 --> 00:45:03,575
You sometimes look really lonely.

556
00:45:05,244 --> 00:45:07,162
But I'm here by your side.

557
00:45:07,246 --> 00:45:09,915
I'll make sure you don't feel lonely.

558
00:45:13,794 --> 00:45:15,504
-You...
-Do you have a boyfriend?

559
00:45:15,587 --> 00:45:16,672
What?

560
00:45:16,755 --> 00:45:17,881
Can I be your boyfriend?

561
00:45:20,259 --> 00:45:22,386
-What do you mean--
-I can love someone, too.

562
00:45:22,469 --> 00:45:24,513
I'm actually already feeling love.

563
00:45:25,597 --> 00:45:26,890
When I look at you...

564
00:45:27,474 --> 00:45:28,517
my heart flutters.

565
00:45:34,523 --> 00:45:35,607
You're...

566
00:45:37,818 --> 00:45:38,986
not Holo.

567
00:46:03,969 --> 00:46:05,053
Nan-do.

568
00:46:19,902 --> 00:46:22,196
I'm going to be a ghost again.

569
00:46:47,888 --> 00:46:49,640
Ko Nan-do, answer your phone.

570
00:46:49,723 --> 00:46:51,308
You have to pick up.

571
00:46:53,060 --> 00:46:56,814
The person you are trying to reach
is unavailable. Please...

572
00:47:03,821 --> 00:47:05,030
HELLO

573
00:47:30,931 --> 00:47:33,350
Ko Nan-do... Where...

574
00:47:41,817 --> 00:47:42,943
Nan-do...

575
00:47:45,863 --> 00:47:47,322
Nan-do.

576
00:48:01,712 --> 00:48:02,629
So-yeon...

577
00:48:06,967 --> 00:48:09,720
Hey, what are you doing here?
Did you fall down?

578
00:48:10,596 --> 00:48:11,430
Yoo-ram.

579
00:48:11,513 --> 00:48:14,099
Yes, it's me. You should've told me
it was your birthday.

580
00:48:14,182 --> 00:48:17,394
I was so busy... What's up with you?

581
00:48:20,814 --> 00:48:22,065
So-yeon.

582
00:48:24,026 --> 00:48:24,985
Didn't you see him?

583
00:48:25,068 --> 00:48:26,612
-Who?
-That person.

584
00:48:28,447 --> 00:48:30,490
Who are you looking for?

585
00:48:35,662 --> 00:48:37,414
Cool, are those the famous glasses?

586
00:48:37,664 --> 00:48:40,250
Hey, I was the tenth person
in Korea to get these.

587
00:48:40,334 --> 00:48:41,960
-Amazing.
-Look at this.

588
00:48:42,544 --> 00:48:45,088
Hi, Holo. Show me next week's schedule.

589
00:48:46,298 --> 00:48:49,927
I guess you could say that is a safe form.

590
00:48:50,010 --> 00:48:51,136
Really?

591
00:48:55,057 --> 00:48:58,518
Do you know why I still use
this outdated phone?

592
00:48:58,602 --> 00:49:01,146
I'm not sure. Because you're outdated?

593
00:49:07,945 --> 00:49:11,281
I'm old, and I'm getting slower
and slower.

594
00:49:11,365 --> 00:49:13,867
But this world is growing faster each day.

595
00:49:16,787 --> 00:49:20,916
When something new comes out,
another new thing comes along

596
00:49:20,999 --> 00:49:23,835
even before we have the chance
to see its functions

597
00:49:23,919 --> 00:49:25,587
and check whether it has problems.

598
00:49:27,130 --> 00:49:29,549
We don't even get the chance
to see what it is.

599
00:49:29,633 --> 00:49:34,471
We have to readjust to the next new thing
because we can't fall behind.

600
00:49:35,430 --> 00:49:36,431
Give me that.

601
00:49:45,190 --> 00:49:46,024
What if...

602
00:49:46,733 --> 00:49:48,860
those glasses

603
00:49:49,027 --> 00:49:51,571
are something like a security camera?

604
00:49:52,322 --> 00:49:55,742
Everyone in the world
would be carrying around

605
00:49:55,826 --> 00:49:58,370
a security camera.

606
00:49:58,453 --> 00:50:02,040
And if someone could have access
to all of them,

607
00:50:02,916 --> 00:50:06,586
that person would think
that they've become a god or something.

608
00:50:08,463 --> 00:50:10,090
Find out where Ko Nan-do is.

609
00:50:10,173 --> 00:50:12,843
Do you mean the former developer
of GIO Lab?

610
00:50:13,385 --> 00:50:14,302
All right.

611
00:50:15,387 --> 00:50:18,557
LOCATING TARGET
KO NAN-DO

612
00:50:22,769 --> 00:50:25,063
LOCATED TARGET
SEOCHO-GU, SEOUL

613
00:50:36,783 --> 00:50:38,160
Hey, look.

614
00:50:39,453 --> 00:50:40,912
He looks like Holo!

615
00:50:40,996 --> 00:50:41,955
What's going on?

616
00:51:12,903 --> 00:51:13,987
Ko Nan-do

617
00:51:14,279 --> 00:51:15,280
has disappeared.
