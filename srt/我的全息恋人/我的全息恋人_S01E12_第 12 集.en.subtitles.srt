1
00:00:47,922 --> 00:00:49,007
Hey.

2
00:00:51,634 --> 00:00:55,263
I'm going on a picnic to Namsan
with my parents tomorrow.

3
00:00:56,181 --> 00:00:57,474
Do you want to come too?

4
00:00:59,934 --> 00:01:02,896
We'll see you at noon
at the Octagonal Pavilion.

5
00:01:02,979 --> 00:01:06,775
I'm glad you thought highly
of my work, Professor,

6
00:01:06,858 --> 00:01:11,404
but Hello was only made
to keep my son company.

7
00:01:15,700 --> 00:01:18,078
Sorry? Are you threatening me?

8
00:01:18,661 --> 00:01:20,622
My mom seems to be in a bad mood.

9
00:01:20,705 --> 00:01:21,748
Professor,

10
00:01:21,831 --> 00:01:25,210
-It's not because of you.
-I only started to work on this project

11
00:01:25,293 --> 00:01:27,045
after I left your research lab.

12
00:01:27,128 --> 00:01:29,798
You don't have the right
to tell me to stop working on it.

13
00:01:29,881 --> 00:01:33,051
Hello, can you ask my mom
if we can go on a picnic tomorrow?

14
00:01:34,135 --> 00:01:37,305
-You can ask her. She'll love it.
-I'm hanging up. Don't call again.

15
00:01:39,891 --> 00:01:41,017
Gosh.

16
00:01:43,812 --> 00:01:46,439
Nan-do, I see you're already home.

17
00:01:47,774 --> 00:01:49,776
Did you have fun with So-yeon?

18
00:01:50,693 --> 00:01:52,779
I guess I lost track of time.

19
00:01:52,862 --> 00:01:55,615
-I'll make some dinner.
-Mom.

20
00:02:01,162 --> 00:02:04,833
Nan-do, did you just call me?

21
00:02:04,916 --> 00:02:05,834
Tomorrow...

22
00:02:07,669 --> 00:02:09,838
Goodness. What about tomorrow?

23
00:02:10,505 --> 00:02:14,259
Let's go on a picnic tomorrow. To Namsan.

24
00:02:15,718 --> 00:02:18,680
Yes, of course. Let's go on a picnic.

25
00:02:24,185 --> 00:02:25,311
Hurry!

26
00:02:25,395 --> 00:02:28,523
Gosh, can you hurry up?
We're supposed to meet them at noon.

27
00:02:28,606 --> 00:02:29,983
Come on!

28
00:02:30,066 --> 00:02:31,734
-Go ahead, So-yeon.
-Unbelievable.

29
00:02:31,818 --> 00:02:33,736
-So-yeon, go ahead.
-Okay.

30
00:02:34,612 --> 00:02:38,074
I'm so happy
that you asked me to go on this picnic.

31
00:02:39,993 --> 00:02:40,994
Hold on.

32
00:02:42,954 --> 00:02:44,205
PROFESSOR BAEK

33
00:02:46,666 --> 00:02:48,042
POWER OFF

34
00:02:51,045 --> 00:02:53,006
Nan-do, do you want some cotton candy too?

35
00:03:01,472 --> 00:03:02,849
Thank you.

36
00:03:12,609 --> 00:03:13,568
Nan-do.

37
00:03:14,110 --> 00:03:17,071
I'll be right back,
so wait for me here, all right?

38
00:03:21,367 --> 00:03:23,161
I said I'll be right back.

39
00:03:23,912 --> 00:03:25,580
Wait for me here, all right?

40
00:04:10,875 --> 00:04:13,586
You know very well what kind of people

41
00:04:13,962 --> 00:04:15,421
I work with.

42
00:04:15,922 --> 00:04:19,842
Locating a single mother
is a piece of cake for me.

43
00:04:20,301 --> 00:04:22,512
I made myself clear yesterday
on the phone.

44
00:04:23,054 --> 00:04:24,347
Must you be this way--

45
00:04:24,430 --> 00:04:28,768
This project
is a matter of national importance.

46
00:04:29,227 --> 00:04:30,311
But...

47
00:04:30,895 --> 00:04:32,438
to be completely honest,

48
00:04:33,189 --> 00:04:36,776
we haven't made much progress
after you left.

49
00:04:36,859 --> 00:04:38,111
I didn't leave.

50
00:04:39,028 --> 00:04:40,113
You kicked me out.

51
00:04:41,114 --> 00:04:43,116
-This isn't my problem anymore.
-Then...

52
00:04:44,325 --> 00:04:47,787
sell me the AI engine you created.

53
00:04:48,746 --> 00:04:50,540
It may only be a toy at this point,

54
00:04:50,623 --> 00:04:54,043
but it has the potential
to be so much more.

55
00:04:54,252 --> 00:04:57,338
-Combining it with our--
-No, thanks. I'm not interested in money.

56
00:04:58,298 --> 00:05:00,383
Why not? You need the money.

57
00:05:01,384 --> 00:05:05,054
You're a single mother
raising an abnormal child.

58
00:05:05,513 --> 00:05:07,598
Don't talk about my son like that.

59
00:05:07,682 --> 00:05:09,642
-I'm leaving.
-Don't you dare!

60
00:05:10,226 --> 00:05:11,894
So you don't care

61
00:05:12,895 --> 00:05:15,440
what happens
to that precious son of yours?

62
00:05:17,567 --> 00:05:19,694
Don't you dare touch my son.

63
00:05:20,194 --> 00:05:22,071
Your papers? Your research?

64
00:05:22,155 --> 00:05:24,782
I'll tell everyone that I'm the one
who wrote all of them.

65
00:05:55,271 --> 00:05:56,397
Nan-do...

66
00:06:01,819 --> 00:06:02,737
Nan-do...

67
00:07:02,296 --> 00:07:04,966
You didn't see my face today.

68
00:07:08,428 --> 00:07:10,221
What I look like

69
00:07:10,721 --> 00:07:12,849
-and what happened here...
-Nan-do...

70
00:07:13,266 --> 00:07:15,810
-You will never remember this.
-Nan-do...

71
00:07:15,893 --> 00:07:18,604
Mom...

72
00:07:18,688 --> 00:07:23,776
If you somehow recognize me someday,

73
00:07:24,902 --> 00:07:27,405
you will die, just like her.

74
00:07:28,698 --> 00:07:32,410
Your mom and dad will also die
because of you.

75
00:07:38,291 --> 00:07:39,584
Mom...

76
00:07:44,672 --> 00:07:46,382
Mom...

77
00:07:46,466 --> 00:07:48,551
-So-yeon!
-So-yeon!

78
00:07:48,634 --> 00:07:50,845
-So-yeon!
-Have you seen a little girl...

79
00:07:50,928 --> 00:07:52,096
So-yeon!

80
00:07:52,388 --> 00:07:53,973
-So-yeon!
-So-yeon!

81
00:07:54,682 --> 00:07:56,184
Mom...

82
00:07:57,268 --> 00:07:58,102
Mom...

83
00:07:59,187 --> 00:08:00,313
Mom...

84
00:08:03,065 --> 00:08:04,025
So-yeon?

85
00:08:04,525 --> 00:08:05,776
So-yeon!

86
00:08:07,111 --> 00:08:08,738
-Mom...
-It's all right, baby.

87
00:08:11,324 --> 00:08:12,158
Honey.

88
00:08:13,034 --> 00:08:15,244
-So-yeon?
-So-yeon, look at us.

89
00:08:22,585 --> 00:08:24,462
It's a pleasure to meet you, Miss Han.

90
00:08:25,963 --> 00:08:28,591
We haven't met, have we?

91
00:09:03,125 --> 00:09:04,210
Holo.

92
00:09:04,669 --> 00:09:05,795
See who that is.

93
00:09:07,088 --> 00:09:08,214
It's Miss Ko's car.

94
00:09:14,679 --> 00:09:15,596
Boss!

95
00:09:19,183 --> 00:09:21,852
-It's all right. Get in!
-Boss!

96
00:09:24,313 --> 00:09:26,065
-Where's So-yeon?
-Just go.

97
00:09:52,049 --> 00:09:54,051
The person you're calling is unavailable--

98
00:09:55,094 --> 00:09:56,137
Shit...

99
00:09:58,306 --> 00:09:59,140
Darn it.

100
00:10:12,903 --> 00:10:15,531
You sure know how to pick hideouts.

101
00:10:15,615 --> 00:10:17,575
So-yeon and Detective Nam
aren't picking up.

102
00:10:17,658 --> 00:10:20,077
Detective Nam said
that he'd look after So-yeon.

103
00:10:22,455 --> 00:10:24,332
Who said what?

104
00:10:28,044 --> 00:10:30,046
I haven't heard from him in hours.

105
00:10:31,047 --> 00:10:32,882
I asked the department for help,

106
00:10:32,965 --> 00:10:35,676
but President Baek
must've already gotten to them.

107
00:10:36,427 --> 00:10:38,512
His 2G phone
doesn't have tracking software,

108
00:10:38,596 --> 00:10:41,766
but his phone was active around Namsan
before he went dark.

109
00:10:42,725 --> 00:10:45,645
Won't Holo be able to find them?

110
00:10:45,728 --> 00:10:49,398
It won't be easy because there aren't many
public security cameras in the area.

111
00:10:49,482 --> 00:10:52,693
But it's not impossible...
if we choose to break the law.

112
00:10:53,903 --> 00:10:55,071
I'll order it this time.

113
00:10:55,529 --> 00:10:58,157
I'm fine asking for help
but not being in someone's debt.

114
00:11:07,458 --> 00:11:10,628
-Did you find them?
-We have their location. Let's go.

115
00:11:10,795 --> 00:11:13,547
Nan-do... Be careful.

116
00:11:49,417 --> 00:11:50,418
Holo?

117
00:11:50,835 --> 00:11:54,004
The tire tracks are fresh.
It's a nine-passenger van.

118
00:11:54,088 --> 00:11:56,215
It looks like
he was dragged to another car.

119
00:11:56,298 --> 00:11:59,051
And that car's still here.

120
00:12:03,514 --> 00:12:04,640
Nan-do, over there!

121
00:12:07,518 --> 00:12:08,352
No!

122
00:12:13,357 --> 00:12:14,692
Stop!

123
00:12:17,153 --> 00:12:18,070
Damn it!

124
00:12:18,404 --> 00:12:19,780
Watch out!

125
00:12:21,490 --> 00:12:22,783
Someone's inside!

126
00:12:23,117 --> 00:12:25,703
-What do you think you're doing?
-Someone's inside.

127
00:12:39,133 --> 00:12:42,803
-He's been badly beaten, but he's alive.
-I can't believe he hurt a cop.

128
00:12:42,887 --> 00:12:46,015
President Baek wanted us
to see Detective Nam's death.

129
00:12:46,474 --> 00:12:47,767
It's his way of saying

130
00:12:49,185 --> 00:12:51,854
that he'll kill So-yeon
if we don't hand over Holo.

131
00:12:57,485 --> 00:13:00,780
You're starting to cause problems for us,
President Baek.

132
00:13:00,863 --> 00:13:04,533
You should've kept your detective
on a tighter leash.

133
00:13:04,992 --> 00:13:06,202
What?

134
00:13:07,119 --> 00:13:09,038
I'm just worried, that's all.

135
00:13:10,706 --> 00:13:13,083
If the world finds out about this,

136
00:13:13,667 --> 00:13:16,212
who do you think will be in worse trouble?

137
00:13:18,255 --> 00:13:19,799
Don't worry, though.

138
00:13:20,341 --> 00:13:24,094
Holo will be back in our hands
before you know it.

139
00:13:29,725 --> 00:13:32,186
-How's Han So-yeon?
-She seems quite scared.

140
00:13:33,729 --> 00:13:36,148
That's no way to treat a guest.

141
00:13:37,399 --> 00:13:38,609
Bring her over here.

142
00:13:49,912 --> 00:13:52,957
-Don't come near me.
-The president would like to see you.

143
00:14:05,886 --> 00:14:08,597
Could I have a cup of coffee?

144
00:14:08,681 --> 00:14:10,307
I'll get one for you.

145
00:14:10,766 --> 00:14:13,435
Do you know how to make a flat white?
That's all I drink.

146
00:14:53,350 --> 00:14:56,520
President Baek is waiting for you.
You can take it with you.

147
00:15:04,737 --> 00:15:05,654
Get her!

148
00:15:05,738 --> 00:15:07,531
-I'm sorry.
-What? Hey, my phone!

149
00:15:09,867 --> 00:15:10,743
Shit!

150
00:15:20,586 --> 00:15:21,670
Get her!

151
00:15:33,057 --> 00:15:33,891
Get the key.

152
00:15:38,604 --> 00:15:39,772
Miss Ko, it's So-yeon.

153
00:15:39,855 --> 00:15:40,981
Are you all right?

154
00:15:41,148 --> 00:15:43,943
-Nan-do and Holo--
-I found out who killed Nan-do's mother.

155
00:15:44,526 --> 00:15:45,361
What?

156
00:15:47,780 --> 00:15:49,907
I saw him myself. I'm sure it's him.

157
00:15:50,616 --> 00:15:51,450
President Baek.

158
00:15:56,497 --> 00:15:57,539
RECENT CALLS

159
00:15:58,666 --> 00:15:59,959
DELETE

160
00:16:23,065 --> 00:16:25,401
I can log into
Magic Mirror's security network.

161
00:16:25,484 --> 00:16:27,820
You don't need to ask
for my permission every time.

162
00:16:27,987 --> 00:16:29,571
You can make your own rules now.

163
00:16:36,829 --> 00:16:38,122
Are you all right with this?

164
00:16:40,708 --> 00:16:44,545
-I'm part of the reason for all this.
-Once this is all over, let your sister

165
00:16:46,296 --> 00:16:47,798
live her own life.

166
00:16:49,758 --> 00:16:51,301
Do you have the right to say that?

167
00:16:53,512 --> 00:16:56,140
Well,
I guess I don't have the right either.

168
00:16:56,724 --> 00:16:57,850
We'll call it even.

169
00:16:59,643 --> 00:17:00,477
Let's go.

170
00:17:11,739 --> 00:17:13,782
We were ordered
to restrict you from entering.

171
00:17:13,866 --> 00:17:15,409
I'm sorry, Vice President Baek.

172
00:17:15,492 --> 00:17:19,496
Didn't you just call me "Vice President"?
Yet I still can't enter?

173
00:17:20,080 --> 00:17:21,081
My apologies.

174
00:17:23,375 --> 00:17:25,586
Excuse me! Sir, wait!

175
00:17:26,837 --> 00:17:27,838
Stop!

176
00:17:49,526 --> 00:17:50,611
Miss Han.

177
00:17:51,236 --> 00:17:55,824
From what I hear,
you suffer from face blindness.

178
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:57,910
It must've been hard for you.

179
00:18:02,164 --> 00:18:04,541
What about now? Do you see my face?

180
00:18:11,298 --> 00:18:12,424
No.

181
00:18:15,511 --> 00:18:18,013
Well, you should've kept it that way.

182
00:18:28,273 --> 00:18:31,235
Sir. Ko Nan-do has entered the building.

183
00:18:31,860 --> 00:18:32,945
Get him!

184
00:18:40,119 --> 00:18:41,161
Shit.

185
00:18:41,787 --> 00:18:42,955
Now!

186
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:47,543
How is he so fast?

187
00:18:47,626 --> 00:18:48,502
What?

188
00:18:48,585 --> 00:18:49,837
After him!

189
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:51,505
Go to the annex building elevator.

190
00:18:57,678 --> 00:18:58,679
That punk!

191
00:19:02,349 --> 00:19:03,308
Sir.

192
00:19:29,626 --> 00:19:32,337
You've secured the security footage,
right? Where's So-yeon?

193
00:19:32,421 --> 00:19:34,756
She's in the server room...
with President Baek.

194
00:19:42,514 --> 00:19:43,390
Let's go.

195
00:19:47,227 --> 00:19:48,812
-Yes?
-Chan-sung.

196
00:19:49,354 --> 00:19:52,357
So-yeon just called me.

197
00:20:23,764 --> 00:20:25,891
-You punk.
-Shit!

198
00:20:25,974 --> 00:20:27,100
You bastard!

199
00:20:31,063 --> 00:20:32,105
Holo!

200
00:20:52,584 --> 00:20:53,418
Move.

201
00:20:53,835 --> 00:20:54,878
He's here.

202
00:21:00,759 --> 00:21:02,761
We have unfinished business, don't we?

203
00:21:23,198 --> 00:21:24,116
Turn on the lights.

204
00:21:42,301 --> 00:21:43,427
Where's So-yeon?

205
00:21:44,511 --> 00:21:46,763
Nan-do, something's not right.

206
00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:51,852
Where's So-yeon--

207
00:22:03,363 --> 00:22:06,366
You're not the only one with cheap tricks.

208
00:22:07,659 --> 00:22:08,493
Nan-do.

209
00:22:10,203 --> 00:22:11,455
What is it?

210
00:22:12,164 --> 00:22:16,335
Didn't you think that our security system
was way too easy to get into?

211
00:22:22,591 --> 00:22:28,138
I already predicted
that you'd use Holo to hack my servers.

212
00:22:29,348 --> 00:22:34,353
Thanks to that, I was able
to bring Holo out from that dump.

213
00:22:42,444 --> 00:22:44,196
Holo, open the server room door.

214
00:22:44,696 --> 00:22:46,948
-Yes, sir.
-Holo?

215
00:23:30,367 --> 00:23:35,247
These glasses are useless now,
but you can keep them as a souvenir.

216
00:23:45,465 --> 00:23:46,591
Nan-do.

217
00:23:47,843 --> 00:23:49,010
You're all right.

218
00:23:51,012 --> 00:23:52,722
What about you? Are you hurt?

219
00:23:56,143 --> 00:23:59,146
-Sorry for not coming sooner.
-It's all right.

220
00:24:00,564 --> 00:24:03,525
But there's something you need to know.

221
00:24:26,256 --> 00:24:27,340
So-yeon saw...

222
00:24:28,717 --> 00:24:30,343
who killed Nan-do's mother.

223
00:24:58,705 --> 00:24:59,789
Then...

224
00:25:01,208 --> 00:25:05,212
is that when you got your face blindness?

225
00:25:22,854 --> 00:25:24,731
Is the surveillance up and running?

226
00:25:24,814 --> 00:25:27,067
Yes, once the servers are stabilized,

227
00:25:27,150 --> 00:25:29,444
-the service will be back online.
-Good.

228
00:25:32,697 --> 00:25:35,033
Tell the engineering team to step on it.

229
00:25:35,116 --> 00:25:36,868
We'll put together a press release--

230
00:25:43,333 --> 00:25:46,419
Did you really kill her?

231
00:25:53,343 --> 00:25:55,095
I can't believe you went that far.

232
00:25:55,178 --> 00:25:57,013
It was an accident, right?

233
00:25:58,098 --> 00:25:59,391
Tell me you had no choice.

234
00:25:59,474 --> 00:26:02,185
That's right, I had no choice.

235
00:26:03,853 --> 00:26:05,188
I needed the program.

236
00:26:08,358 --> 00:26:10,068
Are you going to kill them too?

237
00:26:10,318 --> 00:26:13,321
-If you are, kill me as well.
-You think I won't be able to?

238
00:26:14,739 --> 00:26:16,199
Father, please...

239
00:26:16,283 --> 00:26:19,703
Just stop this.
You now have everything you want!

240
00:26:19,786 --> 00:26:22,205
If you hadn't gone off the rails,

241
00:26:22,289 --> 00:26:24,916
things wouldn't have come this far.

242
00:26:31,047 --> 00:26:33,425
I'm sure I am still of use to you.

243
00:26:33,508 --> 00:26:36,428
If you let those two go,
I will never disobey you again.

244
00:26:36,886 --> 00:26:40,223
I will do everything you want me to do.
If a problem surfaces,

245
00:26:40,557 --> 00:26:43,435
I'll take the fall. Please...

246
00:26:44,144 --> 00:26:48,106
This is the first and last thing
I ask of you as your incompetent son.

247
00:26:52,902 --> 00:26:55,405
Don't get your hands any dirtier, Father.

248
00:27:02,454 --> 00:27:03,371
Get up.

249
00:27:47,499 --> 00:27:49,250
The moment you leave this room,

250
00:27:49,334 --> 00:27:51,670
everything that's happened so far
will be forgotten.

251
00:27:52,379 --> 00:27:55,840
I have decided to take care
of the legal matters, so you just need...

252
00:27:56,383 --> 00:27:57,384
to give Holo up.

253
00:28:00,220 --> 00:28:01,346
What are you doing?

254
00:28:03,306 --> 00:28:04,766
I had no other choice.

255
00:28:06,142 --> 00:28:07,310
Please tell Yoo-jin...

256
00:28:08,978 --> 00:28:10,814
that I'm grateful for everything.

257
00:28:17,404 --> 00:28:19,030
The only son I have

258
00:28:19,114 --> 00:28:22,992
is too much like his mother.
He's unnecessarily sentimental.

259
00:28:26,496 --> 00:28:31,668
What is it? You look like
you have a problem with me. Tell me.

260
00:28:31,751 --> 00:28:34,796
It feels awkward for me too,
to just send you home like this.

261
00:28:41,177 --> 00:28:42,554
You have nothing to say?

262
00:28:43,138 --> 00:28:47,016
Then get lost before I change my mind.

263
00:28:47,100 --> 00:28:48,476
We'll escort you out.

264
00:29:08,747 --> 00:29:12,709
-What are you doing?
-Unfortunately, I've changed my mind.

265
00:29:13,293 --> 00:29:14,419
Father!

266
00:29:19,424 --> 00:29:21,926
Shut up if you want
to at least save Ko Yoo-jin.

267
00:29:34,814 --> 00:29:35,815
Holo,

268
00:29:36,232 --> 00:29:37,108
drop them.

269
00:29:38,067 --> 00:29:39,486
-Fuck.
-No...

270
00:31:25,133 --> 00:31:27,427
What are you doing, Holo? Drop them!

271
00:31:27,510 --> 00:31:28,887
Nan-do's mother

272
00:31:30,346 --> 00:31:33,474
created me for her beloved son.
She made me

273
00:31:34,601 --> 00:31:36,895
so my first priority would be
to protect Nan-do

274
00:31:36,978 --> 00:31:39,272
and everyone Nan-do loves.

275
00:31:51,618 --> 00:31:55,455
At first, even I didn't know
how it was possible.

276
00:31:55,538 --> 00:31:58,750
A piece of trash like you
would never understand it, though.

277
00:32:10,762 --> 00:32:13,514
Chan-sung, you idiot.
How dare you do this to your father?

278
00:32:19,562 --> 00:32:22,023
This is where our relationship
as father and son ends.

279
00:32:41,167 --> 00:32:44,003
What will you do
to an old man on crutches?

280
00:32:44,087 --> 00:32:47,840
Have you forgotten about
that high and mighty humanism?

281
00:32:48,716 --> 00:32:51,928
Why did you kill her?
What did my mother ever do to you?

282
00:32:53,846 --> 00:32:55,390
So all you have to say

283
00:32:55,473 --> 00:32:57,767
is about something that happened
over 20 years ago?

284
00:32:57,850 --> 00:32:59,018
-You...
-Nan-do!

285
00:33:02,397 --> 00:33:03,398
Because of you,

286
00:33:04,732 --> 00:33:07,068
I spent my whole life resenting my mom.

287
00:33:08,319 --> 00:33:09,737
And So-yeon...

288
00:33:10,488 --> 00:33:14,075
had to live in fear
because of her face blindness.

289
00:33:14,158 --> 00:33:15,702
You'll pay for everything.

290
00:33:15,785 --> 00:33:16,911
Will I?

291
00:33:17,996 --> 00:33:18,830
Holo...

292
00:33:19,914 --> 00:33:22,250
hacked into the system
searching for evidence,

293
00:33:22,333 --> 00:33:24,711
but he came up empty. Why?

294
00:33:26,087 --> 00:33:31,050
Any evidence that could be suspicious
was discarded that day.

295
00:33:31,134 --> 00:33:32,343
-Darn you--
-I...

296
00:33:33,511 --> 00:33:35,054
am a witness.

297
00:33:38,516 --> 00:33:41,436
That will be a fun scene
to watch in court.

298
00:33:43,438 --> 00:33:47,775
Will you even be able to recognize me
if I'm sitting alongside other people?

299
00:33:51,904 --> 00:33:54,824
The police are on their way,
and I've already secured

300
00:33:54,907 --> 00:33:57,744
his program codes as evidence.
That will be enough...

301
00:33:58,453 --> 00:33:59,287
to punish him.

302
00:33:59,370 --> 00:34:02,081
Do you really believe
I did this all on my own?

303
00:34:04,417 --> 00:34:08,755
Those who also got their hands dirty
will protect me

304
00:34:08,838 --> 00:34:10,214
to save their own asses.

305
00:34:10,882 --> 00:34:12,133
You bastard!

306
00:34:15,011 --> 00:34:16,679
No, don't.

307
00:34:26,439 --> 00:34:27,774
She's not the only witness.

308
00:34:29,776 --> 00:34:31,194
-What?
-What?

309
00:34:32,820 --> 00:34:34,322
-Any evidence...
-Who's this?

310
00:34:34,405 --> 00:34:36,074
-...that could be suspicious...
-Huh?

311
00:34:36,157 --> 00:34:38,284
-Isn't this President Baek?
-...was discarded.

312
00:34:38,367 --> 00:34:39,994
-President Baek.
-That will be...

313
00:34:40,078 --> 00:34:43,206
-President Baek?
-...a fun scene to watch in court.

314
00:34:43,956 --> 00:34:46,084
Will you even be able to recognize me

315
00:34:46,167 --> 00:34:48,211
if I'm sitting alongside other people?

316
00:34:48,795 --> 00:34:51,005
Those who also got their hands dirty

317
00:34:52,215 --> 00:34:54,425
will protect me

318
00:34:55,093 --> 00:34:57,053
to save their own asses.

319
00:34:57,720 --> 00:34:59,138
The entire nation

320
00:34:59,222 --> 00:35:00,807
just saw you confess.

321
00:35:04,435 --> 00:35:05,353
It's a lie.

322
00:35:06,062 --> 00:35:07,605
This is all a lie.

323
00:35:07,688 --> 00:35:09,190
This is a setup.

324
00:35:09,273 --> 00:35:11,609
It's a lie. This is a setup!

325
00:35:11,859 --> 00:35:13,653
This is all a lie. This is a setup!

326
00:35:13,736 --> 00:35:15,863
This is a setup!

327
00:35:18,449 --> 00:35:20,159
President Baek of Magic Mirror

328
00:35:20,243 --> 00:35:23,246
was arrested immediately
after his confession was broadcast live.

329
00:35:23,329 --> 00:35:26,040
This incident
has shocked the entire nation.

330
00:35:26,124 --> 00:35:28,042
In addition to the charges of murder,

331
00:35:28,126 --> 00:35:31,712
the police already have enough evidence
regarding the illegal acts

332
00:35:31,796 --> 00:35:33,798
that were performed using
the HoloGlass,

333
00:35:33,881 --> 00:35:35,508
and will soon investigate them all.

334
00:35:35,591 --> 00:35:39,804
Meanwhile, a debate has ensued over
whether a hack performed by an AI

335
00:35:39,887 --> 00:35:42,557
can be categorized as a crime,
and the prosecution...

336
00:35:46,435 --> 00:35:47,937
People will soon know

337
00:35:48,437 --> 00:35:50,273
that the nationwide hack

338
00:35:50,940 --> 00:35:53,568
was performed
through the free will of an AI.

339
00:35:54,652 --> 00:35:58,156
Some will fear it, while others will want
the software for themselves.

340
00:35:59,448 --> 00:36:00,491
Either way,

341
00:36:02,451 --> 00:36:03,661
I should not exist.

342
00:36:05,454 --> 00:36:08,291
But you were only trying
to stop President Baek.

343
00:36:08,374 --> 00:36:11,586
People won't believe
that I'll keep acting with goodwill.

344
00:36:22,680 --> 00:36:24,307
The rest of you can wait here.

345
00:36:28,186 --> 00:36:30,396
Also, I can't be sure of myself either.

346
00:36:31,355 --> 00:36:34,984
If someone else like President Baek
tries to hurt you,

347
00:36:35,943 --> 00:36:38,196
will I be able to save you both then
as well?

348
00:36:40,615 --> 00:36:41,574
Nan-do.

349
00:36:42,742 --> 00:36:44,702
You told me to make my own rules.

350
00:36:51,334 --> 00:36:53,920
Protecting those I care about

351
00:36:58,216 --> 00:37:01,052
at the expense of my existence...

352
00:37:04,805 --> 00:37:06,265
That is my principle.

353
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:41,676
I'm sorry,

354
00:37:44,303 --> 00:37:46,097
but we'll always be friends.

355
00:37:47,348 --> 00:37:48,391
Forever.

356
00:38:50,870 --> 00:38:54,540
Are you watching this?
This was your favorite beach.

357
00:38:56,959 --> 00:38:58,502
It's already been a year

358
00:38:59,378 --> 00:39:01,213
since you left us.

359
00:39:03,424 --> 00:39:05,634
Many things have happened since then.

360
00:39:06,677 --> 00:39:09,597
We all need other people in our lives.

361
00:39:10,181 --> 00:39:11,432
Why is that?

362
00:39:11,515 --> 00:39:14,352
It's probably
because we're all imperfect beings.

363
00:39:14,602 --> 00:39:18,522
That is why I've always believed
that an AI was a flawless being.

364
00:39:19,982 --> 00:39:21,901
However, many things happened last year

365
00:39:22,985 --> 00:39:25,738
because of this pair of glasses.

366
00:39:27,073 --> 00:39:28,908
They were a shock to some,

367
00:39:29,575 --> 00:39:31,369
a comfort to others.

368
00:39:31,911 --> 00:39:33,746
They were a fascination to some,

369
00:39:34,246 --> 00:39:37,458
and they also brought pain to others.

370
00:39:40,836 --> 00:39:43,672
As a result, Holo has chosen to leave us.

371
00:39:44,090 --> 00:39:46,050
However, the sincerity he left behind

372
00:39:46,467 --> 00:39:49,261
gave GIO Lab the force it needed

373
00:39:49,387 --> 00:39:51,555
to move toward a new goal.

374
00:39:51,639 --> 00:39:55,851
And I'm sure you're all curious
as to what GIO Lab

375
00:39:55,935 --> 00:39:57,478
has been up to all this time.

376
00:39:58,229 --> 00:40:00,981
Hello Glasses are glasses
that will connect people.

377
00:40:01,065 --> 00:40:03,901
Let us introduce
Miss Han So-yeon of Prism Optical,

378
00:40:03,984 --> 00:40:06,529
the person
who first suggested this project.

379
00:40:19,667 --> 00:40:20,626
Miss Han.

380
00:40:21,252 --> 00:40:22,253
How have you been?

381
00:40:22,336 --> 00:40:25,047
I've been incredibly busy
with the launch of Hello Glasses.

382
00:40:25,423 --> 00:40:26,674
I see.

383
00:40:27,007 --> 00:40:29,885
Is that why you haven't had the time
to go on dates with me?

384
00:40:33,431 --> 00:40:34,932
We'll talk about that later--

385
00:40:35,015 --> 00:40:37,184
Come on. What's so hard
about watching a movie--

386
00:40:37,268 --> 00:40:38,310
Stop it, gosh.

387
00:40:42,648 --> 00:40:46,110
As you can see,
through a real-time holographic image,

388
00:40:46,193 --> 00:40:48,779
we can see each other
as if we're actually together.

389
00:40:53,826 --> 00:40:55,828
GIO Lab combined its AI technology

390
00:40:56,036 --> 00:40:58,164
with the idea suggested by Prism Optical

391
00:40:58,247 --> 00:41:01,125
to intricately recreate
a person's facial expressions and figure

392
00:41:01,208 --> 00:41:03,127
as a holographic image.

393
00:41:05,171 --> 00:41:06,797
Miss Han, may we ask

394
00:41:06,881 --> 00:41:09,550
how you first came up
with the idea of Hello Glasses?

395
00:41:09,633 --> 00:41:10,551
Well...

396
00:41:12,178 --> 00:41:13,220
No reason.

397
00:41:15,389 --> 00:41:16,223
"No reason"?

398
00:41:16,640 --> 00:41:20,102
Actually, it was this thought
that occurred to me.

399
00:41:20,186 --> 00:41:22,980
We were all born alone,

400
00:41:23,606 --> 00:41:27,443
but that's why
we can all be there for one another.

401
00:41:47,087 --> 00:41:49,131
-Good job!
-Good job.

402
00:41:53,844 --> 00:41:55,721
-Cheers!
-Cheers!

403
00:42:01,018 --> 00:42:02,603
Good job, So-yeon.

404
00:42:02,686 --> 00:42:06,357
I knew from the beginning
that So-yeon would do great things.

405
00:42:06,440 --> 00:42:09,318
At the flagship store launching party,

406
00:42:09,401 --> 00:42:12,780
she escorted the president
and introduced him to all the guests

407
00:42:12,863 --> 00:42:14,740
even though she had face blindness.

408
00:42:14,823 --> 00:42:16,492
That's not easy.

409
00:42:16,575 --> 00:42:18,410
Of course, it isn't.

410
00:42:18,494 --> 00:42:21,372
Don't you remember
how we used to talk badly about her

411
00:42:21,455 --> 00:42:24,750
for not greeting us,
for always skipping team dinners,

412
00:42:24,833 --> 00:42:26,919
and just being a snob in general?

413
00:42:27,002 --> 00:42:28,170
Shush!

414
00:42:28,671 --> 00:42:30,798
-She talked badly about you.
-What?

415
00:42:30,881 --> 00:42:32,925
I only nodded along.

416
00:42:33,008 --> 00:42:34,552
-Jeez.
-That's not true.

417
00:42:34,635 --> 00:42:38,097
Well, whatever. Bottoms up, everyone!

418
00:42:38,639 --> 00:42:41,350
-I hid my face blindness from you.
-Right.

419
00:42:41,433 --> 00:42:43,352
It's too bad, though,

420
00:42:43,477 --> 00:42:46,605
because I'm often told
that I look like a celebrity,

421
00:42:46,689 --> 00:42:48,399
but you can't see it.

422
00:42:48,482 --> 00:42:49,942
-Right...
-Seriously?

423
00:42:51,068 --> 00:42:51,944
Shut up.

424
00:42:52,027 --> 00:42:53,112
Should I?

425
00:42:53,195 --> 00:42:54,488
So...

426
00:42:54,572 --> 00:42:56,323
How is it going with your boyfriend?

427
00:42:56,407 --> 00:42:57,700
Things are the same.

428
00:42:57,783 --> 00:43:01,161
He sulks like a child all the time
and gets prickly often...

429
00:43:02,413 --> 00:43:03,831
It's my boyfriend.

430
00:43:03,914 --> 00:43:08,377
You went from wanting to strangle him
to shooting hearts out of your eyes.

431
00:43:08,460 --> 00:43:10,379
-My gosh.
-Hello, everyone.

432
00:43:11,046 --> 00:43:12,214
-Hi.
-Hello.

433
00:43:12,298 --> 00:43:13,132
My baby told me--

434
00:43:15,134 --> 00:43:17,803
I mean, So-yeon told me about you.
It's nice to meet you.

435
00:43:17,886 --> 00:43:19,805
-Hello.
-Cheers!

436
00:43:22,516 --> 00:43:25,227
Many people tell me
that my personality has changed.

437
00:43:25,311 --> 00:43:26,520
How silly I actually am.

438
00:43:27,104 --> 00:43:28,981
Maybe because I don't hide it anymore,

439
00:43:29,648 --> 00:43:32,484
so my true self
must be coming out, just like you said.

440
00:43:39,617 --> 00:43:41,118
You should hop down now.

441
00:43:41,452 --> 00:43:42,995
I know you've sobered up.

442
00:43:44,496 --> 00:43:46,248
Gosh, you're heavy.

443
00:43:47,166 --> 00:43:48,208
I don't want to.

444
00:43:48,792 --> 00:43:50,836
You used to carry me even when I refused.

445
00:43:51,754 --> 00:43:55,507
Having someone in your life
sure adds a lot of weight.

446
00:43:57,760 --> 00:43:59,303
Are you saying you don't want to?

447
00:44:03,057 --> 00:44:04,016
No.

448
00:44:04,642 --> 00:44:06,143
You're the perfect weight.

449
00:44:12,775 --> 00:44:13,651
So?

450
00:44:13,734 --> 00:44:15,277
How far have they gotten?

451
00:44:15,361 --> 00:44:19,239
Unfortunately,
nothing special has happened.

452
00:44:21,158 --> 00:44:23,160
Are you kidding me?

453
00:44:23,243 --> 00:44:26,789
What kind of couple
is this slow to make progress these days?

454
00:44:27,665 --> 00:44:29,500
Who do you think is to blame?

455
00:44:29,583 --> 00:44:31,126
Both, I guess.

456
00:44:31,210 --> 00:44:34,296
They both have zero experience
when it comes to dating.

457
00:44:35,631 --> 00:44:36,674
Gosh.

458
00:44:37,174 --> 00:44:40,386
We're here. How about a shower together?

459
00:44:41,053 --> 00:44:41,887
Oh my!

460
00:44:42,596 --> 00:44:43,555
What's this?

461
00:44:45,391 --> 00:44:48,060
I can't believe you came unannounced, Mom.

462
00:44:48,143 --> 00:44:50,270
A couple shouldn't be home
so early like this.

463
00:44:50,938 --> 00:44:52,898
I'm sorry. I'll make sure to--

464
00:44:53,148 --> 00:44:53,982
Sorry?

465
00:44:59,071 --> 00:45:00,155
Mom.

466
00:45:00,280 --> 00:45:03,701
What are you doing?
You really should cut back on the alcohol.

467
00:45:07,413 --> 00:45:08,455
Mom.

468
00:45:11,458 --> 00:45:12,501
Mom...

469
00:45:12,584 --> 00:45:13,794
What's going on?

470
00:45:15,671 --> 00:45:17,256
Mom, I see you.

471
00:45:18,048 --> 00:45:19,383
I see you too.

472
00:45:19,800 --> 00:45:20,718
I mean...

473
00:45:23,387 --> 00:45:26,849
It's blurry, but I can still see you.

474
00:45:26,932 --> 00:45:29,101
What is she saying...

475
00:45:30,602 --> 00:45:31,437
You...

476
00:45:33,230 --> 00:45:35,858
Do you really see me?

477
00:45:37,317 --> 00:45:39,903
Can you really see my face?

478
00:45:40,612 --> 00:45:41,530
Yes.

479
00:45:42,948 --> 00:45:43,824
Do...

480
00:45:44,408 --> 00:45:45,868
-My gosh!
-Mom!

481
00:45:46,618 --> 00:45:48,537
Can you really see me?

482
00:45:48,620 --> 00:45:50,289
-Mom!
-God bless us!

483
00:45:52,666 --> 00:45:54,209
Mom.

484
00:45:54,293 --> 00:45:55,753
You can really see me?

485
00:46:00,591 --> 00:46:01,675
Mom!

486
00:46:05,763 --> 00:46:09,433
My poor baby, your suffering is over.

487
00:46:09,516 --> 00:46:10,809
Goodness.

488
00:46:11,518 --> 00:46:13,061
Thank you.

489
00:46:13,145 --> 00:46:14,605
Do you really see my face?

490
00:46:14,688 --> 00:46:16,774
It had been a while
since I saw my mom's face.

491
00:46:16,857 --> 00:46:19,067
-Mom...
-She had aged quite a bit.

492
00:46:19,151 --> 00:46:20,319
That's why I felt sadder.

493
00:46:20,402 --> 00:46:21,403
Mom...

494
00:46:22,029 --> 00:46:24,990
These days, my mom tears up
every time she sees me.

495
00:46:31,872 --> 00:46:33,582
It would've been nice

496
00:46:33,665 --> 00:46:35,793
if you'd been with us
on a happy day like this.

497
00:46:42,841 --> 00:46:43,759
Yoo-jin!

498
00:46:45,093 --> 00:46:46,220
So-yeon.

499
00:46:47,137 --> 00:46:49,556
-Wow, you look incredible.
-You look great too.

500
00:46:49,640 --> 00:46:50,724
Gosh.

501
00:46:52,267 --> 00:46:53,519
My gosh.

502
00:46:53,602 --> 00:46:55,938
I didn't know
you were this pretty, Yoo-jin.

503
00:46:56,021 --> 00:46:59,149
-More so than So-yeon?
-No one should be prettier than the bride.

504
00:47:01,610 --> 00:47:02,986
You sure have gotten cheesier.

505
00:47:03,654 --> 00:47:05,239
CHAN-SUNG AND YOO-JIN

506
00:47:09,743 --> 00:47:10,577
You're here!

507
00:47:12,663 --> 00:47:13,664
Hello.

508
00:47:16,041 --> 00:47:18,126
-What's with you two?
-Isn't it obvious?

509
00:47:18,877 --> 00:47:21,922
You should get out more
and meet people too.

510
00:47:23,549 --> 00:47:26,093
I'm outside meeting people right now.

511
00:47:26,176 --> 00:47:29,638
Instead of criminals,
meet pretty people like my Ji-na here.

512
00:47:29,721 --> 00:47:30,764
-What?
-Shall we?

513
00:47:31,598 --> 00:47:32,474
Let's go.

514
00:48:16,226 --> 00:48:17,895
I promise

515
00:48:17,978 --> 00:48:19,771
to love you forever

516
00:48:20,355 --> 00:48:22,399
and devote my life to you.

517
00:48:22,941 --> 00:48:26,945
I promise with all my heart
to always love you

518
00:48:27,112 --> 00:48:29,072
and be with you.

519
00:49:01,980 --> 00:49:03,023
I miss you.

520
00:49:03,482 --> 00:49:05,067
More so today than ever.

521
00:49:06,401 --> 00:49:08,695
I'm sure Nan-do feels the same way.

522
00:49:14,868 --> 00:49:15,994
What are you doing here?

523
00:49:19,206 --> 00:49:20,707
Those glasses. It's been a while.

524
00:49:22,542 --> 00:49:23,460
You know,

525
00:49:24,169 --> 00:49:26,213
I thought
he might be listening somewhere.

526
00:49:31,343 --> 00:49:33,929
Mr. Cho told me
you often work all night long.

527
00:49:34,012 --> 00:49:35,430
You never told me that.

528
00:49:35,639 --> 00:49:37,641
When President Baek was restoring Holo,

529
00:49:37,724 --> 00:49:40,060
he secretly uploaded Holo's files
on the dark web.

530
00:49:40,435 --> 00:49:43,438
Those files have been destroyed too,
but you never know.

531
00:49:43,522 --> 00:49:45,857
Then is there a chance
that he could return?

532
00:49:46,817 --> 00:49:48,026
Well...

533
00:49:48,110 --> 00:49:51,571
There's about 0.0000001 percent
probability.

534
00:49:54,366 --> 00:49:55,575
At least it's not zero.

535
00:49:58,996 --> 00:50:00,122
I almost forgot.

536
00:50:00,831 --> 00:50:04,376
-They're waiting for us for the picture.
-Really? You should've told me sooner.

537
00:50:07,671 --> 00:50:11,091
-You said that they're waiting for us.
-Let them.

538
00:50:11,925 --> 00:50:14,553
-Let's stay like this for a while.
-Okay.

539
00:50:22,853 --> 00:50:23,729
-Sorry.
-Hello.

540
00:50:23,812 --> 00:50:25,188
-You're here.
-Where were you?

541
00:50:25,272 --> 00:50:27,357
-Come and take your places.
-Hurry.

542
00:50:27,941 --> 00:50:29,651
-Are we good? Here we go.
-Sure.

543
00:50:29,735 --> 00:50:30,610
Go ahead.

544
00:50:35,073 --> 00:50:36,491
Smile, everyone!

545
00:50:44,374 --> 00:50:45,375
You look gorgeous.

546
00:50:46,626 --> 00:50:48,045
Seriously, Boss?

547
00:50:48,587 --> 00:50:50,130
You closed your eyes.

548
00:50:50,213 --> 00:50:51,590
-Oh, dear.
-That's too bad.

549
00:50:51,673 --> 00:50:53,091
-Gosh.
-Let's take another one.

550
00:50:53,175 --> 00:50:54,676
Seriously, Nan-do?

551
00:50:54,760 --> 00:50:56,136
Keep your eyes open.

552
00:50:56,219 --> 00:50:57,804
-Open them wide.
-Again.

553
00:50:58,597 --> 00:50:59,973
Here we go.

554
00:51:00,640 --> 00:51:01,600
One more time.

555
00:51:01,850 --> 00:51:03,560
Smile, everyone!

556
00:51:05,187 --> 00:51:06,813
-Great.
-I think we're good.

557
00:51:06,897 --> 00:51:08,565
-Did you close your eyes?
-I didn't.

558
00:51:14,821 --> 00:51:17,324
-You both look like such nice people.
-Do we look alike?

559
00:51:19,701 --> 00:51:20,911
Boss?

560
00:51:20,994 --> 00:51:22,245
-Again?
-I kept them open.

561
00:51:22,329 --> 00:51:23,371
That's not it.

562
00:51:24,414 --> 00:51:26,750
You need to see this.

563
00:51:27,542 --> 00:51:29,002
What's wrong with him today?

564
00:51:31,463 --> 00:51:34,424
-You're teasing me, aren't you?
-No, take a look at this.

565
00:53:09,060 --> 00:53:10,937
