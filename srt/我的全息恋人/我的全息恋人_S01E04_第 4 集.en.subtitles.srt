1
00:00:54,888 --> 00:00:55,805
Holo.

2
00:01:13,573 --> 00:01:15,658
Just call me So-yeon.

3
00:01:17,619 --> 00:01:19,788
Okay, So-yeon.

4
00:01:20,497 --> 00:01:21,331
Holo.

5
00:01:22,290 --> 00:01:23,124
Holo.

6
00:01:35,804 --> 00:01:37,180
Holo.

7
00:01:37,722 --> 00:01:39,057
Holo.

8
00:01:39,682 --> 00:01:42,310
You said you'd always stay by my side.

9
00:01:44,104 --> 00:01:47,482
The system got tangled
due to Holo resisting the rollback.

10
00:01:48,650 --> 00:01:49,859
Holo.

11
00:01:56,324 --> 00:01:58,868
Cancel Holo's rollback.

12
00:02:07,085 --> 00:02:10,171
-What happened?
-I guess the boss changed his mind.

13
00:02:10,255 --> 00:02:12,173
-You know how he is.
-What about So-yeon?

14
00:02:12,257 --> 00:02:14,050
She met and talked with Gang-woo.

15
00:02:14,134 --> 00:02:15,510
Well, about that...

16
00:02:16,177 --> 00:02:17,303
It didn't work out.

17
00:02:17,637 --> 00:02:20,515
Can you stay still?
I need to run a diagnostic check on you.

18
00:02:24,894 --> 00:02:25,728
Han So-yeon.

19
00:02:26,271 --> 00:02:28,106
I'm glad that you are this way.

20
00:02:29,691 --> 00:02:34,362
The fact that we're still imperfect...
is what let us meet in the first place.

21
00:02:39,117 --> 00:02:39,951
Are you okay?

22
00:02:47,834 --> 00:02:51,087
Neither your pulse nor body temperature
are at normal levels right now.

23
00:02:51,546 --> 00:02:54,966
I feel fine. I wonder why you say that.

24
00:02:56,301 --> 00:02:58,303
I'm sorry I said I'd be by your side

25
00:02:58,386 --> 00:03:00,722
only to break that promise
at an important moment.

26
00:03:01,389 --> 00:03:03,558
-From now on--
-I told you, it's fine.

27
00:03:04,267 --> 00:03:07,562
I think the things you said before
helped me feel better.

28
00:03:08,771 --> 00:03:09,606
Thanks.

29
00:03:12,942 --> 00:03:15,820
I'm so tired after crying
and making such a fuss.

30
00:03:15,904 --> 00:03:17,322
I should get some sleep.

31
00:03:24,579 --> 00:03:26,206
I must be out of my mind.

32
00:03:31,628 --> 00:03:33,546
Why'd you cancel the rollback?

33
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:38,009
I've decided to believe
your recent unpredictable behavior

34
00:03:38,092 --> 00:03:41,095
isn't a bug but a sign of development.

35
00:03:41,179 --> 00:03:43,598
-Then--
-I'm going to start an official beta test.

36
00:03:44,098 --> 00:03:47,310
Just tell that woman
there was a mix-up at the company.

37
00:03:49,646 --> 00:03:50,480
Is she...

38
00:03:51,648 --> 00:03:53,274
-okay?
-What?

39
00:03:53,358 --> 00:03:54,442
I mean, that woman.

40
00:03:54,525 --> 00:03:57,320
-Well, I'm sure she's not okay, but...
-She's fine.

41
00:03:57,403 --> 00:04:00,073
She said thank you. It was you, right?

42
00:04:00,156 --> 00:04:04,577
I think the things you said to her
while I was gone made her feel better.

43
00:04:07,163 --> 00:04:09,123
-Really?
-What did you say to her?

44
00:04:09,207 --> 00:04:10,166
Nothing much.

45
00:04:10,541 --> 00:04:13,836
I just pretended to be you
and said things you might say.

46
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:15,380
Things that I might say?

47
00:04:15,505 --> 00:04:16,756
Never mind.

48
00:04:16,839 --> 00:04:19,509
Just go and take care of your user.

49
00:04:20,718 --> 00:04:21,552
Jeez.

50
00:04:21,844 --> 00:04:24,555
I'm so exhausted.
I haven't slept properly in days.

51
00:04:25,974 --> 00:04:28,101
-I'm going to sleep, so go away.
-All right.

52
00:04:28,768 --> 00:04:29,602
Sweet dreams.

53
00:04:59,924 --> 00:05:01,426
I must be out of my mind.

54
00:05:40,923 --> 00:05:43,259
Here are the documents you asked for.

55
00:05:43,343 --> 00:05:45,261
-Right.
-So-yeon.

56
00:05:46,596 --> 00:05:48,723
-Yes?
-I got a bit too emotional yesterday,

57
00:05:48,806 --> 00:05:49,640
didn't I?

58
00:05:49,849 --> 00:05:50,850
Sorry about that.

59
00:05:50,933 --> 00:05:53,519
-It's fine.
-Let's not be awkward with each other

60
00:05:53,603 --> 00:05:55,313
and be on good terms like before.

61
00:05:55,396 --> 00:05:57,523
Well... sure.

62
00:06:04,405 --> 00:06:06,366
Don't worry. Just explain, and--

63
00:06:06,449 --> 00:06:08,326
No, there's no need for that.

64
00:06:08,409 --> 00:06:09,494
Why not?

65
00:06:09,577 --> 00:06:11,913
I'd be too ashamed to try.
I don't deserve to.

66
00:06:11,996 --> 00:06:14,165
-Don't say things like that.
-No, I mean it.

67
00:06:19,003 --> 00:06:24,258
This incident helped me realize something.
I'm so pathetic and incompetent.

68
00:06:27,595 --> 00:06:29,389
Just promise me one thing, then.

69
00:06:31,265 --> 00:06:32,975
Lean on me if it gets too hard.

70
00:07:17,353 --> 00:07:18,271
Jeez!

71
00:07:26,612 --> 00:07:27,572
HOLO

72
00:07:29,073 --> 00:07:31,701
I thought her feelings
ran deeper than that.

73
00:07:32,952 --> 00:07:37,123
Maybe she's hiding her true feelings?
Or maybe...

74
00:07:38,916 --> 00:07:41,919
Is it that she's scared
she'll be hurt even more?

75
00:07:43,171 --> 00:07:44,088
Right?

76
00:07:44,172 --> 00:07:46,466
Just when I thought
it couldn't get any worse.

77
00:07:47,758 --> 00:07:51,345
Wait...
Why am I talking about this with you?

78
00:07:51,429 --> 00:07:54,390
-You're worried about So-yeon--
-What? I'm worried?

79
00:07:55,850 --> 00:07:59,520
Wait, no. I should be worried.

80
00:07:59,604 --> 00:08:02,732
There's no better beta tester than
a woman suffering from heartbreak.

81
00:08:04,025 --> 00:08:05,401
-What--
-Get lost.

82
00:08:09,780 --> 00:08:10,615
Jeez.

83
00:08:13,034 --> 00:08:16,037
Han So-yeon. Thirty years old.
An average office worker.

84
00:08:17,205 --> 00:08:20,708
Why did they choose her of all people
to be the beta tester?

85
00:08:21,792 --> 00:08:23,669
What about this man who looks like Holo?

86
00:08:23,753 --> 00:08:26,756
I couldn't find a match for him
in the list of GIO Lab employees.

87
00:08:27,298 --> 00:08:29,050
There's no way he was just a model.

88
00:08:29,634 --> 00:08:33,930
He must be involved with the development,
but there's no information about him.

89
00:08:42,438 --> 00:08:44,941
I wonder what kind of relationship
they have.

90
00:08:48,778 --> 00:08:50,363
And what about these two?

91
00:08:55,117 --> 00:08:56,494
Fascinating.

92
00:08:56,577 --> 00:08:58,496
When should we take the glasses?

93
00:09:00,206 --> 00:09:04,877
The cops have been keeping a close eye
on them since the blackout.

94
00:09:05,836 --> 00:09:07,755
So until we get an idea of
what's going on,

95
00:09:08,381 --> 00:09:10,508
let's keep watch from the sidelines.

96
00:09:11,092 --> 00:09:12,218
I understand, sir.

97
00:09:32,863 --> 00:09:36,033
How are people supposed to buy this
when they put it so high up?

98
00:09:36,909 --> 00:09:38,661
We do live in the same neighborhood,

99
00:09:38,744 --> 00:09:41,664
so it's not unusual for us
to run into each other like this.

100
00:09:43,624 --> 00:09:46,711
-Thank you.
-By the way, is all of that alcohol?

101
00:09:46,794 --> 00:09:47,878
Yes, well...

102
00:09:47,962 --> 00:09:51,507
Alcohol is bad for the body
and worse for the brain.

103
00:09:51,591 --> 00:09:55,303
Don't drown your sorrows in alcohol.
It's a stupid thing to do.

104
00:09:55,761 --> 00:09:57,096
My sorrows?

105
00:09:58,806 --> 00:10:03,019
I mean, your skin looks pretty saggy
and you have really deep dark circles.

106
00:10:03,102 --> 00:10:05,229
So that's what I assumed.

107
00:10:06,230 --> 00:10:08,941
You sure have a talent
for upsetting people.

108
00:10:09,025 --> 00:10:10,735
I was just trying to help--

109
00:10:10,818 --> 00:10:15,114
Sorry if you're just trying to help,
but mind your own business.

110
00:10:19,118 --> 00:10:20,077
Why, you...

111
00:11:00,034 --> 00:11:00,868
Let's drink.

112
00:11:06,082 --> 00:11:07,416
Gosh, that's sweet.

113
00:11:08,334 --> 00:11:10,294
What's the matter? Are you feeling down?

114
00:11:11,045 --> 00:11:12,922
Shall we have a rooftop party?

115
00:11:13,005 --> 00:11:15,633
How about some fireflies?
Or do you want to dance?

116
00:11:21,681 --> 00:11:22,515
No.

117
00:11:24,684 --> 00:11:27,436
Seriously, what is wrong with me?

118
00:11:27,978 --> 00:11:32,024
Who's making a racket on the rooftop
so late, waking up the whole neighborhood?

119
00:11:32,525 --> 00:11:36,946
I was about to have a drink up here,
but it looks like you beat me to it.

120
00:11:38,406 --> 00:11:40,324
You're back, Yoo-ram.

121
00:11:40,408 --> 00:11:42,660
Gosh, why did you drink so much?

122
00:11:45,955 --> 00:11:46,789
What's wrong?

123
00:12:12,481 --> 00:12:13,774
AMERICANO

124
00:12:18,487 --> 00:12:21,532
Bottom of the ninth,
two outs with all bases loaded.

125
00:12:21,615 --> 00:12:22,908
Pitcher Ko Nan-do.

126
00:13:02,615 --> 00:13:04,241
It's snowing!

127
00:13:24,845 --> 00:13:27,848
They're not recycling properly.
What's wrong with these people?

128
00:13:28,307 --> 00:13:29,809
That woman would throw a fit...

129
00:13:37,858 --> 00:13:40,694
I told you,
there are a lot of men in this world.

130
00:13:40,778 --> 00:13:42,530
Just forget about him.

131
00:13:45,241 --> 00:13:46,075
Jeez.

132
00:13:53,666 --> 00:13:57,336
Gosh. You keep missing him even though
you want to forget about him, don't you?

133
00:13:57,419 --> 00:13:59,338
-Yes.
-That's it. Come on, let's go.

134
00:14:00,464 --> 00:14:01,632
-Where?
-On a trip.

135
00:14:01,715 --> 00:14:04,134
I'm going to enjoy the ocean
to my heart's content.

136
00:14:04,218 --> 00:14:06,303
Ocean? You're going to the ocean?

137
00:14:06,387 --> 00:14:08,389
Yes. Why?

138
00:14:08,848 --> 00:14:11,767
To tell you the truth,
I've never seen the ocean before.

139
00:14:11,851 --> 00:14:15,521
There are tons of videos
and photos of it if you look online.

140
00:14:16,313 --> 00:14:17,731
You can just look them up.

141
00:14:17,815 --> 00:14:21,402
Yes, but knowing about it and experiencing
it are two different things.

142
00:14:22,278 --> 00:14:24,613
I want to know what it would feel like.

143
00:14:29,285 --> 00:14:31,579
-The thing is, Holo...
-Yes?

144
00:14:31,996 --> 00:14:33,831
I'm not wearing the glasses on the trip.

145
00:14:33,914 --> 00:14:36,834
-What?
-I'm going to enjoy a change of scenery

146
00:14:36,917 --> 00:14:38,460
and clear my head.

147
00:14:38,544 --> 00:14:41,589
I really need that right now.

148
00:14:44,049 --> 00:14:48,095
-Is that okay?
-Sure, if that's what you want.

149
00:15:07,323 --> 00:15:08,991
I feel so refreshed!

150
00:15:09,074 --> 00:15:10,242
This is so nice.

151
00:15:20,252 --> 00:15:21,545
-Cheers.
-Yeah.

152
00:15:24,673 --> 00:15:26,759
The ocean looks so pretty.

153
00:15:26,842 --> 00:15:28,636
I'm going to take a picture.

154
00:15:30,971 --> 00:15:33,849
-Come here. Let's take a selfie together.
-Sure.

155
00:15:33,933 --> 00:15:35,100
One, two, three.

156
00:15:35,559 --> 00:15:38,270
-One more time, from this angle.
-Jeez.

157
00:15:39,355 --> 00:15:40,981
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

158
00:15:42,483 --> 00:15:44,568
-I need to use the bathroom.
-Sure.

159
00:16:05,547 --> 00:16:07,049
POSTS
DO YOO-RAM

160
00:16:15,224 --> 00:16:17,184
She's not wearing the glasses.

161
00:16:17,267 --> 00:16:18,268
What are you doing?

162
00:16:19,979 --> 00:16:22,022
What? What do you want?

163
00:16:22,106 --> 00:16:24,149
I've detected people
who keep tailing So-yeon.

164
00:16:27,236 --> 00:16:29,571
-It's those bastards.
-I think you should go to her.

165
00:16:29,655 --> 00:16:32,449
Why should I? You can take on
two or three guys on your own.

166
00:16:32,533 --> 00:16:33,909
I can't do anything.

167
00:16:33,993 --> 00:16:36,620
-So-yeon isn't wearing the glasses.
-Have her put them on

168
00:16:36,704 --> 00:16:39,289
and tell her to guard them.
Shady guys are after her.

169
00:16:39,373 --> 00:16:41,959
-I can't. Right now, she's--
-She's what?

170
00:16:42,042 --> 00:16:44,545
I think she wants to be alone
with her friend right now.

171
00:16:44,628 --> 00:16:46,672
-I don't want to bother her.
-Really?

172
00:16:47,923 --> 00:16:50,592
Did she go on a trip to ease
her heartbreak or whatever?

173
00:16:50,676 --> 00:16:51,802
She needs your help.

174
00:16:52,052 --> 00:16:55,973
You can just cause a blackout
or lock them up somewhere, can't you?

175
00:16:56,056 --> 00:16:58,267
Can I do that? I'd be breaking the rules.

176
00:16:58,976 --> 00:17:01,103
-You can't.
-I couldn't, even if I wanted to.

177
00:17:01,186 --> 00:17:03,564
I don't know how I caused
the blackout last time.

178
00:17:03,647 --> 00:17:07,067
I'll let Jin-seok know,
so call him if you can't manage it.

179
00:17:07,818 --> 00:17:10,154
I don't want to deal with
that woman anymore.

180
00:17:11,405 --> 00:17:12,239
All right.

181
00:17:23,292 --> 00:17:25,919
I'm sure Holo will take care of it.

182
00:17:26,003 --> 00:17:28,380
You shouldn't be so laid-back about this.

183
00:17:29,256 --> 00:17:32,885
Think. What if she takes a boat
to the middle of nowhere and loses signal?

184
00:17:32,968 --> 00:17:35,387
How will Holo be able to handle that
on his own?

185
00:17:35,804 --> 00:17:36,638
You think so?

186
00:17:37,097 --> 00:17:40,100
Well, if you're that worried,
you should go there yourself...

187
00:17:41,935 --> 00:17:45,064
-I mean, what I meant was--
-I guess I have no choice

188
00:17:45,606 --> 00:17:47,524
when you put it like that.

189
00:17:49,485 --> 00:17:50,319
What?

190
00:17:53,363 --> 00:17:55,199
I'm going because I trust your judgment.

191
00:17:55,282 --> 00:17:57,993
Yes, sir. I'm going home now,
since it's the weekend...

192
00:17:58,952 --> 00:17:59,953
What's up with him?

193
00:18:00,454 --> 00:18:01,747
Keep monitoring them.

194
00:18:02,831 --> 00:18:05,542
What about the glasses?
Are you sure that woman has them?

195
00:18:05,626 --> 00:18:07,920
Yes. And they don't see
that man anywhere nearby.

196
00:18:09,129 --> 00:18:11,090
He could still be keeping an eye on her,

197
00:18:11,465 --> 00:18:13,008
-so be cautious.
-Yes, sir.

198
00:18:19,098 --> 00:18:21,767
This is a video analysis tool
that's in development.

199
00:18:21,850 --> 00:18:23,143
Do you find it helpful?

200
00:18:24,728 --> 00:18:26,021
Wow, this is amazing.

201
00:18:26,980 --> 00:18:30,192
I asked you for help
because our equipment has limitations,

202
00:18:30,275 --> 00:18:31,944
but this exceeds expectations.

203
00:18:32,611 --> 00:18:34,613
Hearing that makes me feel better.

204
00:18:35,781 --> 00:18:36,740
All done.

205
00:18:37,991 --> 00:18:40,744
Do you recognize this man?

206
00:18:42,955 --> 00:18:45,666
No.
Is this man the hacker you mentioned?

207
00:18:49,294 --> 00:18:50,671
Excuse me for a moment.

208
00:18:52,965 --> 00:18:55,175
-Yes?
-Do you want the good news first

209
00:18:55,259 --> 00:18:56,802
or the bad news first?

210
00:18:56,885 --> 00:18:59,346
-The bad news.
-I'll give you the good first.

211
00:19:00,931 --> 00:19:04,601
We managed to find a fingerprint
on the motorcycle.

212
00:19:04,768 --> 00:19:07,146
-The thing is--
-The print's not in the database?

213
00:19:08,063 --> 00:19:09,398
So that's the bad news.

214
00:19:10,107 --> 00:19:11,233
You're no fun.

215
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:14,820
Who could he be? A minor?
Or an illegal immigrant?

216
00:19:14,903 --> 00:19:16,572
He's definitely not a minor.

217
00:19:16,905 --> 00:19:18,448
We've got an image of him.

218
00:19:19,741 --> 00:19:20,826
Anyway, thanks.

219
00:19:23,078 --> 00:19:24,580
My apologies.

220
00:19:25,664 --> 00:19:27,749
I can't believe
people still use flip phones.

221
00:19:28,333 --> 00:19:29,877
You do care a lot about security.

222
00:19:30,502 --> 00:19:32,004
I'm old-fashioned, that's all.

223
00:19:35,966 --> 00:19:37,176
Is there no way?

224
00:19:37,259 --> 00:19:41,138
I'm sorry. All of our normal rooms
are booked, so we can't do anything.

225
00:19:41,638 --> 00:19:44,016
Let's just find a guesthouse somewhere
or something.

226
00:19:44,099 --> 00:19:45,726
I can't just leave like this.

227
00:19:46,101 --> 00:19:49,188
-You have a suite though, right?
-Are you out of your mind?

228
00:19:49,813 --> 00:19:51,398
These are the rates.

229
00:19:55,944 --> 00:19:58,113
-Let's go.
-What's wrong?

230
00:19:59,489 --> 00:20:01,742
Who are you? Do you know him?

231
00:20:02,075 --> 00:20:04,786
I'm your neighbor.
I moved in not too long ago.

232
00:20:04,870 --> 00:20:09,750
We got a neighbor like him
while I was away working?

233
00:20:11,793 --> 00:20:14,004
-Fancy running into you.
-What a coincidence.

234
00:20:15,255 --> 00:20:16,089
Yes.

235
00:20:17,799 --> 00:20:20,219
I see you've booked the suite.
Here's your key.

236
00:20:20,302 --> 00:20:22,095
This isn't a coincidence. This is fate.

237
00:20:23,222 --> 00:20:24,514
Stop it. Let's go.

238
00:20:25,224 --> 00:20:26,892
-Let's go.
-Why?

239
00:20:27,351 --> 00:20:30,229
A suite has a lot of rooms, right?
Can we stay in one of them?

240
00:20:30,312 --> 00:20:32,648
I said let's go.
Jeez, you must be crazy.

241
00:20:32,940 --> 00:20:34,441
Don't mind us. Bye.

242
00:20:37,152 --> 00:20:38,237
That's fine with me.

243
00:20:52,376 --> 00:20:54,419
Too bad
we're the only ones enjoying the view.

244
00:20:56,546 --> 00:20:58,382
He could have had a drink with us.

245
00:20:58,465 --> 00:21:00,801
I think he doesn't like drinking.

246
00:21:01,176 --> 00:21:02,302
Gosh, look at you.

247
00:21:02,552 --> 00:21:04,596
You two are already so close, I see.

248
00:21:05,305 --> 00:21:06,431
I don't know about that.

249
00:21:15,565 --> 00:21:17,067
-Hey, Yoo-ram.
-Yeah?

250
00:21:18,568 --> 00:21:21,530
I wanted to ask you about something
my friend is going through.

251
00:21:21,613 --> 00:21:24,032
One day, she started to have feelings...

252
00:21:24,741 --> 00:21:26,535
for this guy friend she has.

253
00:21:26,618 --> 00:21:29,955
That's how it always is.
Guys and girls can't be just friends.

254
00:21:30,038 --> 00:21:32,666
It's impossible.

255
00:21:33,041 --> 00:21:37,879
Well, anyway, the guy friend
is a guy who you shouldn't...

256
00:21:38,714 --> 00:21:42,050
or rather, a guy who you can't love.
Isn't it weird?

257
00:21:44,094 --> 00:21:46,555
I see, so he already has a girl.

258
00:21:47,389 --> 00:21:50,392
-Don't tell me he's married.
-No, it's not like that.

259
00:21:51,059 --> 00:21:52,269
Does he have debt?

260
00:21:53,729 --> 00:21:55,105
Is he an ex-convict?

261
00:21:56,898 --> 00:21:58,400
Oh, I see. He's gay.

262
00:21:59,234 --> 00:22:01,194
No, that's not it! Come on.

263
00:22:01,278 --> 00:22:03,155
Then why can't she love him?

264
00:22:04,781 --> 00:22:06,700
Apparently, she can't say why.

265
00:22:08,035 --> 00:22:10,996
-But anyway--
-I don't know what the reason could be,

266
00:22:11,079 --> 00:22:13,332
but if it makes her happy to love him,

267
00:22:13,415 --> 00:22:15,792
what does it matter
if he has a certain problem

268
00:22:15,876 --> 00:22:18,086
or if people talk behind their backs?

269
00:22:18,170 --> 00:22:19,129
-Right?
-Yeah.

270
00:22:19,379 --> 00:22:21,423
After all,
a person can like another person.

271
00:22:24,176 --> 00:22:25,010
Right.

272
00:22:25,927 --> 00:22:29,097
But that only applies
if both parties are human.

273
00:23:42,796 --> 00:23:43,672
Wow!

274
00:23:43,755 --> 00:23:46,758
So this is the sound of real ocean waves.
And this is a real ocean!

275
00:23:47,217 --> 00:23:49,177
It's much better than I thought.

276
00:23:49,886 --> 00:23:51,263
Can we get closer?

277
00:24:01,356 --> 00:24:02,357
Look at this!

278
00:24:02,441 --> 00:24:05,861
I think I get where the phrase
"a breaking wave" came from.

279
00:24:09,197 --> 00:24:10,365
Let's go!

280
00:24:21,543 --> 00:24:23,628
I always wanted to try
something like this.

281
00:24:39,936 --> 00:24:41,146
You look like you're cold.

282
00:24:41,730 --> 00:24:45,400
I know it won't make you any warmer,
but I thought you'd at least feel better.

283
00:25:01,791 --> 00:25:03,627
I don't feel warmer at all.

284
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:05,003
I know.

285
00:25:10,133 --> 00:25:14,804
Holo, why did you say that it's okay
for me to not wear the glasses?

286
00:25:15,263 --> 00:25:16,806
You wanted to see the ocean.

287
00:25:16,890 --> 00:25:20,143
People aren't like machines
that can be repaired when broken.

288
00:25:21,102 --> 00:25:23,855
Sometimes, they need to be left alone.

289
00:25:24,231 --> 00:25:25,565
Didn't I upset you?

290
00:25:25,690 --> 00:25:27,943
No, because this is what you wanted.

291
00:25:30,654 --> 00:25:35,992
You can always confide in me if you need
to get something off your chest.

292
00:25:38,578 --> 00:25:40,455
You wouldn't get it even if I told you.

293
00:25:51,091 --> 00:25:52,551
You're not even human.

294
00:25:52,634 --> 00:25:54,386
So stop acting like you are.

295
00:25:54,469 --> 00:25:57,180
-Does it make you feel uncomfortable?
-Yeah.

296
00:25:57,264 --> 00:26:00,058
-Because you keep crossing the line, I...
-"Line"?

297
00:26:00,850 --> 00:26:04,521
-So am I no longer helping you be happy?
-No, what I mean is...

298
00:26:08,149 --> 00:26:12,320
You're only seeing the ocean
through the glasses I'm wearing.

299
00:26:12,404 --> 00:26:15,156
It's not like you're really standing
in front of me.

300
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:18,910
But I keep getting confused
because you're acting like a real person.

301
00:26:18,994 --> 00:26:21,871
Would it be better
if you couldn't see me, then?

302
00:26:22,706 --> 00:26:26,293
How about I just give you
audio guidance when you need help?

303
00:26:28,962 --> 00:26:29,796
Okay.

304
00:26:34,092 --> 00:26:38,221
And I don't want you to use...
such a friendly tone anymore.

305
00:26:41,057 --> 00:26:42,267
I understand.

306
00:26:43,935 --> 00:26:48,565
Still, it is good that you're not saying
you don't need me anymore.

307
00:27:01,661 --> 00:27:03,955
The target is alone, and she has the item.

308
00:27:04,039 --> 00:27:05,582
We're making our move now.

309
00:27:12,839 --> 00:27:13,757
Excuse me.

310
00:27:14,341 --> 00:27:15,925
Let me ask you something.

311
00:27:18,511 --> 00:27:19,596
Who sent you guys?

312
00:27:24,351 --> 00:27:25,268
Get rid of him.

313
00:27:25,852 --> 00:27:26,686
Oh, dear.

314
00:27:27,312 --> 00:27:29,022
So you'd rather resort to brute force

315
00:27:29,105 --> 00:27:31,483
when we have
better methods of communication?

316
00:27:32,025 --> 00:27:33,318
Damn it.

317
00:27:44,579 --> 00:27:45,413
Damn it.

318
00:27:55,131 --> 00:27:56,383
Damn it.

319
00:28:01,054 --> 00:28:02,138
All right, then.

320
00:28:02,472 --> 00:28:03,973
How about we talk now?

321
00:28:08,853 --> 00:28:10,063
Damn it.

322
00:28:24,244 --> 00:28:25,870
It's really cold outside.

323
00:28:31,042 --> 00:28:32,669
Here, drink something warm.

324
00:28:41,511 --> 00:28:42,887
Are you hurt?

325
00:28:42,971 --> 00:28:44,889
-You're bleeding.
-Jeez.

326
00:28:48,685 --> 00:28:49,644
I'm fine.

327
00:28:52,897 --> 00:28:53,732
Jeez...

328
00:28:55,191 --> 00:28:56,693
This is so damn embarrassing.

329
00:28:57,944 --> 00:28:59,696
I told you, tilt your head back.

330
00:29:03,867 --> 00:29:05,201
Here, wipe your hands.

331
00:29:19,799 --> 00:29:21,134
This is for your nose.

332
00:29:22,886 --> 00:29:26,055
Why were you walking around alone
on such a cold night?

333
00:29:26,222 --> 00:29:28,558
Are you suffering from heartbreak
or something?

334
00:29:35,899 --> 00:29:38,401
I bet you used your drunkenness
as an excuse

335
00:29:38,485 --> 00:29:41,863
to walk along the shore at night
and get all sentimental.

336
00:29:44,115 --> 00:29:47,410
Well, is it so wrong to get sentimental?

337
00:29:47,494 --> 00:29:49,078
Is it so wrong to drink a little?

338
00:29:49,162 --> 00:29:52,123
I bet nobody wants to drink
with you anyway,

339
00:29:52,207 --> 00:29:53,416
with that nasty attitude.

340
00:29:53,500 --> 00:29:56,169
I'm not so mentally weak
that I need to resort to drinking.

341
00:29:56,252 --> 00:29:57,962
Oh, I see.

342
00:29:58,713 --> 00:30:00,256
You're so inhuman.

343
00:30:02,717 --> 00:30:04,302
What I meant was...

344
00:30:07,388 --> 00:30:10,475
it's not a big deal, so just shake it off.

345
00:30:12,644 --> 00:30:14,062
It's not a big deal?

346
00:30:17,065 --> 00:30:19,192
You have no empathy at all, do you?

347
00:30:19,359 --> 00:30:23,446
Or maybe you don't have emotions.
Have you ever even loved someone?

348
00:30:25,073 --> 00:30:27,492
Just express your emotions honestly!

349
00:30:27,575 --> 00:30:30,203
-You can't even do that.
-You don't know anything about me.

350
00:30:30,286 --> 00:30:31,996
-How dare you!
-Of course I don't.

351
00:30:48,555 --> 00:30:50,682
-What are you looking at?
-Oh, my God!

352
00:30:51,641 --> 00:30:53,434
Hey, Boss.

353
00:30:53,601 --> 00:30:54,936
When did you get here?

354
00:30:55,270 --> 00:30:57,522
Well, is Han So-yeon okay?

355
00:30:57,605 --> 00:30:59,983
How would I know?

356
00:31:04,404 --> 00:31:08,157
She put the glasses back on,
so you monitor her now.

357
00:31:08,491 --> 00:31:10,326
Let me know if anything comes up.

358
00:31:10,410 --> 00:31:13,162
-Yes, sir.
-Wait, no. Don't tell me anything.

359
00:31:13,580 --> 00:31:15,164
-Yes, sir.
-Actually, tell me.

360
00:31:16,791 --> 00:31:17,625
Yes, sir.

361
00:31:20,962 --> 00:31:23,798
I heard you fought those bastards.
Are you okay?

362
00:31:24,507 --> 00:31:25,592
I'm so relieved.

363
00:31:26,676 --> 00:31:27,927
What happened?

364
00:31:29,679 --> 00:31:30,763
I lost them.

365
00:31:31,389 --> 00:31:34,350
In this situation, it'd be better
to get the police involved...

366
00:31:35,768 --> 00:31:38,730
-or not.
-It wasn't all for nothing, though.

367
00:31:41,858 --> 00:31:44,777
What? Hey, Boss. You need to see this.

368
00:31:44,861 --> 00:31:46,070
This is weird.

369
00:31:46,154 --> 00:31:49,324
Holo's data transfer signal
dropped to below ten percent.

370
00:31:53,036 --> 00:31:57,749
She told me not to show myself
or act like a human being around her.

371
00:31:58,708 --> 00:32:01,669
But this is what sets our product
apart from the rest.

372
00:32:01,753 --> 00:32:04,839
She's basically trying
to distance herself from you, then.

373
00:32:05,173 --> 00:32:06,382
But why?

374
00:32:06,466 --> 00:32:10,595
I've been analyzing it from all sides,
but I don't have a clear answer yet.

375
00:32:10,678 --> 00:32:14,098
That means that there was a serious issue
with the user experience.

376
00:32:17,602 --> 00:32:20,229
Figure this out.
I need to get to the bottom of this.

377
00:32:20,313 --> 00:32:21,689
What are you going to do?

378
00:32:21,773 --> 00:32:24,609
If I want to find out why that woman
suddenly wants to do this,

379
00:32:24,692 --> 00:32:26,444
I need to thoroughly analyze

380
00:32:26,527 --> 00:32:28,196
all of Holo's memories.

381
00:32:28,279 --> 00:32:30,907
VICE PRESIDENT BAEK CHAN-SUNG

382
00:32:30,990 --> 00:32:31,908
I apologize, sir.

383
00:32:36,663 --> 00:32:40,875
Is this mysterious ghost trying
to protect the glasses or that woman?

384
00:32:43,544 --> 00:32:46,798
You said that woman
was just an average office worker, right?

385
00:32:50,927 --> 00:32:54,180
She's assistant manager of marketing
at an eyewear company called Prism.

386
00:32:54,263 --> 00:32:55,390
An eyewear company?

387
00:33:02,355 --> 00:33:03,189
Leave.

388
00:33:19,664 --> 00:33:20,623
Yes, President.

389
00:33:23,918 --> 00:33:24,919
No.

390
00:33:27,463 --> 00:33:29,549
We have a foolproof plan this time.

391
00:33:31,926 --> 00:33:32,885
Yes.

392
00:33:35,221 --> 00:33:36,806
I won't let you down.

393
00:33:54,449 --> 00:33:58,661
I'm thankful for a chance to work with
a big company like Magic Mirror, but...

394
00:33:58,745 --> 00:34:00,246
You think this is too sudden?

395
00:34:00,997 --> 00:34:04,083
Our company is actually developing
smart glasses right now,

396
00:34:04,167 --> 00:34:07,336
and we're struggling with the design
and fit of our glasses.

397
00:34:07,420 --> 00:34:09,505
We were looking to collaborate.

398
00:34:09,589 --> 00:34:12,842
Our company is the very best.
We're ready to risk our lives for this.

399
00:34:13,718 --> 00:34:15,303
I hope it doesn't come to that.

400
00:34:15,386 --> 00:34:17,680
For now, we need to hold
a small press conference

401
00:34:17,764 --> 00:34:20,266
about the collaboration
at our company’s next symposium.

402
00:34:20,349 --> 00:34:23,561
Which team planned the launch event
for your flagship store?

403
00:34:23,644 --> 00:34:25,688
I read an article about it.
It was impressive.

404
00:34:25,772 --> 00:34:26,939
Marketing Team One.

405
00:34:27,690 --> 00:34:29,692
That team can handle
this project too, then.

406
00:34:29,776 --> 00:34:30,735
Thank you.

407
00:34:31,903 --> 00:34:33,154
We're doing it ourselves?

408
00:34:33,237 --> 00:34:35,364
Of course. This is an amazing opportunity.

409
00:34:35,448 --> 00:34:37,867
But projects of this scale
are always handled by...

410
00:34:38,326 --> 00:34:40,411
-the senior manager.
-The thing is,

411
00:34:41,579 --> 00:34:44,123
Mr. Yeon won't be able to take care of it.

412
00:34:44,207 --> 00:34:46,584
I'm sorry to be telling you this now.

413
00:34:46,667 --> 00:34:49,337
I'm being transferred
to the new overseas branch in the US.

414
00:34:49,420 --> 00:34:51,464
-What?
-Oh, really?

415
00:34:51,547 --> 00:34:54,967
We can talk about that later.
Anyway, who wants to do the presentation?

416
00:34:55,843 --> 00:34:57,720
Presentation? Well...

417
00:34:57,929 --> 00:34:59,764
-Miss Park?
-Pardon?

418
00:35:00,681 --> 00:35:05,228
-Well, I have a lot of work to do already.
-Who's going to do it?

419
00:35:05,311 --> 00:35:06,979
I'll do it, then.

420
00:35:07,063 --> 00:35:08,147
Yeah, sounds good.

421
00:35:08,856 --> 00:35:11,943
Yes, I like this volunteering spirit.

422
00:35:12,735 --> 00:35:14,821
You must be so happy.

423
00:35:15,029 --> 00:35:17,281
Has this been in the works for a while?

424
00:35:17,365 --> 00:35:19,867
We'd only talked about it,
but things moved quickly.

425
00:35:19,951 --> 00:35:23,287
-How long will you be there?
-I don't know. I think around two years.

426
00:35:23,371 --> 00:35:24,247
-Holo.
-Two years?

427
00:35:24,956 --> 00:35:26,707
-Find all the related materials.
-Wow!

428
00:35:26,791 --> 00:35:28,835
Should I summarize them
and e-mail you?

429
00:35:28,918 --> 00:35:31,003
-Are you going to have to find a place...
-Yes.

430
00:35:31,963 --> 00:35:33,756
They'll probably get me a place, right?

431
00:35:46,144 --> 00:35:48,062
Do you really have to go this far?

432
00:35:48,771 --> 00:35:50,982
Why are you so obsessed with Han So-yeon?

433
00:35:51,065 --> 00:35:51,899
Obsessed?

434
00:35:51,983 --> 00:35:54,986
I'm just doing my job as a developer now,
that's all.

435
00:35:58,531 --> 00:35:59,740
Drink this.

436
00:36:10,459 --> 00:36:11,752
This is weird.

437
00:36:35,151 --> 00:36:37,904
You're working so hard
even at such late hours.

438
00:36:37,987 --> 00:36:40,740
Do you have an umbrella?
It's raining a lot outside.

439
00:36:41,073 --> 00:36:42,408
Oh, really?

440
00:36:42,491 --> 00:36:45,077
There are spare umbrellas
on the first floor. Take one.

441
00:36:45,578 --> 00:36:47,914
Thank you. I'll bring it back tomorrow.

442
00:37:06,265 --> 00:37:07,225
Watch out, miss!

443
00:37:11,812 --> 00:37:12,939
Thank you.

444
00:37:32,166 --> 00:37:34,335
How could you leave us so suddenly?

445
00:37:34,418 --> 00:37:35,586
You're so cruel.

446
00:37:35,753 --> 00:37:36,837
Exactly.

447
00:37:36,921 --> 00:37:40,591
By the way, don't they need
an assistant manager at the US branch?

448
00:37:40,675 --> 00:37:42,343
I'll have to see once I get there.

449
00:37:42,426 --> 00:37:43,302
Who knows?

450
00:37:43,386 --> 00:37:45,721
I might come back next year
if we don't do well.

451
00:37:45,805 --> 00:37:46,764
Yeah.

452
00:37:46,847 --> 00:37:50,351
Don't be so sad. He's not leaving forever.
We're supposed to be celebrating!

453
00:37:50,476 --> 00:37:52,728
-Have a drink. Have a safe journey.
-Thank you.

454
00:37:52,812 --> 00:37:54,855
-Cheers.
-Have a safe journey.

455
00:37:54,939 --> 00:37:56,524
-Safe journey.
-Come back soon.

456
00:38:04,949 --> 00:38:07,118
If you need an assistant manager, call me.

457
00:38:07,201 --> 00:38:08,577
-That's enough.
-Sure.

458
00:38:18,462 --> 00:38:19,463
Holo.

459
00:38:20,548 --> 00:38:22,008
Yes, did you call for me?

460
00:38:27,179 --> 00:38:30,725
-What will the weather be like tomorrow?
-It'll be sunny...

461
00:38:31,017 --> 00:38:33,352
but with a lot of pollutants in the air.

462
00:38:34,520 --> 00:38:35,855
And the day after tomorrow?

463
00:38:35,938 --> 00:38:40,359
It'll drop to below zero degrees Celsius,
so be careful not to catch a cold.

464
00:38:41,944 --> 00:38:43,029
Okay.

465
00:38:43,279 --> 00:38:44,822
I see.

466
00:38:45,823 --> 00:38:46,741
Are you okay, miss?

467
00:38:48,367 --> 00:38:49,493
I'm fine.

468
00:38:49,577 --> 00:38:51,662
I'm just a bit dizzy...

469
00:38:56,959 --> 00:38:58,836
-What...
-Are you okay?

470
00:39:10,097 --> 00:39:12,058
You're working so hard
at such late hours.

471
00:39:12,141 --> 00:39:14,727
There are spare umbrellas
on the first floor. Take one.

472
00:39:14,810 --> 00:39:16,228
Watch out, miss!

473
00:39:21,942 --> 00:39:23,194
Was it you...

474
00:39:26,447 --> 00:39:27,656
all along?

475
00:39:27,740 --> 00:39:29,116
I'm sorry.

476
00:39:30,701 --> 00:39:31,869
I told you...

477
00:39:33,496 --> 00:39:35,414
that I don't want to see you.

478
00:39:36,457 --> 00:39:37,792
Why did you do this?

479
00:39:38,667 --> 00:39:41,754
I couldn't just sit by
and watch you suffering on your own.

480
00:39:42,088 --> 00:39:43,672
So I wanted to help you

481
00:39:43,756 --> 00:39:45,299
in any way I could.

482
00:39:48,469 --> 00:39:49,428
Yes...

483
00:39:50,429 --> 00:39:53,641
it's true that you cheered me up.
But that was only because...

484
00:39:56,519 --> 00:39:58,646
I thought those people were real.

485
00:40:13,953 --> 00:40:15,037
You were right.

486
00:40:15,121 --> 00:40:16,664
It's all my fault.

487
00:40:16,747 --> 00:40:20,042
I shouldn't have volunteered
to be her relationship coach.

488
00:40:20,126 --> 00:40:22,545
I shouldn't have promised her
I wouldn't leave her.

489
00:40:22,628 --> 00:40:25,548
I would've completely agreed with you

490
00:40:26,465 --> 00:40:27,550
up until a while ago.

491
00:40:27,633 --> 00:40:28,926
What could it be, then?

492
00:40:29,969 --> 00:40:34,306
I'm not fully sure, but it could be
something that neither of us expected.

493
00:40:34,390 --> 00:40:36,684
The hypothesis is that I have an error.

494
00:40:36,767 --> 00:40:39,979
Please fix that error
so that I can make So-yeon happy again.

495
00:40:40,438 --> 00:40:43,482
You're the only one who can
because you're the one who created me.

496
00:40:44,358 --> 00:40:45,192
All right.

497
00:40:51,866 --> 00:40:52,992
An error.

498
00:40:54,201 --> 00:40:55,995
It's an error caused by Han So-yeon.

499
00:41:04,211 --> 00:41:05,796
What if the error that Holo has...

500
00:41:08,674 --> 00:41:10,134
is the same...

501
00:41:11,844 --> 00:41:13,053
as my own?

502
00:41:21,103 --> 00:41:23,564
I guess security's tight
since it's a huge company.

503
00:41:23,647 --> 00:41:25,024
-Goodness.
-All clear.

504
00:41:25,107 --> 00:41:26,025
Let's go.

505
00:41:26,108 --> 00:41:28,235
Could you please stretch out your arms?

506
00:41:30,905 --> 00:41:32,072
All clear.

507
00:41:40,331 --> 00:41:41,624
Sir.

508
00:41:42,750 --> 00:41:43,584
Zoom in.

509
00:41:49,465 --> 00:41:50,883
We've found the item.

510
00:41:50,966 --> 00:41:53,344
Good. Proceed with our plans.
Make no mistake.

511
00:41:53,427 --> 00:41:54,553
I understand, sir.

512
00:41:59,099 --> 00:42:00,184
Hello.

513
00:42:00,434 --> 00:42:02,561
Oh, hello.

514
00:42:03,646 --> 00:42:05,272
-She must be Miss Han So-yeon.
-Yes.

515
00:42:05,981 --> 00:42:07,358
-Hello.
-Good luck today.

516
00:42:07,441 --> 00:42:08,400
Thank you.

517
00:42:08,901 --> 00:42:09,735
-This way.
-Sure.

518
00:42:10,653 --> 00:42:11,570
Let's go.

519
00:42:21,622 --> 00:42:26,377
The new eyewear we're releasing
boasts both a simple and powerful design.

520
00:42:27,336 --> 00:42:30,756
Please look forward to the collaboration
between Prism and Magic Mirror

521
00:42:30,839 --> 00:42:33,467
which will bring excitement
to the smart eyewear market.

522
00:42:34,009 --> 00:42:37,012
That concludes my presentation. Thank you.

523
00:42:47,773 --> 00:42:48,691
Good work.

524
00:42:51,151 --> 00:42:54,488
We're ready to block all communications
within a 500-meter radius.

525
00:42:55,698 --> 00:42:56,532
Jeez.

526
00:42:57,199 --> 00:42:58,617
Good job.

527
00:43:03,122 --> 00:43:05,749
Don't forget that our communications
will be down too.

528
00:43:05,833 --> 00:43:07,459
We only get one chance.

529
00:43:27,271 --> 00:43:31,191
-Did the presentation go well?
-Yes, thanks to your help.

530
00:43:31,859 --> 00:43:32,818
That's a relief.

531
00:43:34,236 --> 00:43:37,990
I've asked my creator to fix me.

532
00:43:38,157 --> 00:43:40,409
-I found out the cause of the error.
-What is it?

533
00:43:41,577 --> 00:43:42,953
When Holo first saw So-yeon...

534
00:43:45,122 --> 00:43:47,791
-I mean, Han So-yeon.
-Yeah, I remember.

535
00:43:47,875 --> 00:43:49,835
It was for a split second, but Holo froze.

536
00:43:49,918 --> 00:43:52,796
Something similar happened
when Holo caused a blackout

537
00:43:52,880 --> 00:43:54,214
to save Han So-yeon, too.

538
00:43:56,008 --> 00:43:59,428
And there's another common factor
among his interactions with her.

539
00:43:59,511 --> 00:44:01,555
-What are you...
-Just wait a bit longer.

540
00:44:01,639 --> 00:44:05,351
I'll be able to make you happy again
as soon as he fixes the error.

541
00:44:07,186 --> 00:44:09,813
What do you mean?
What do you mean, you have an error?

542
00:44:11,315 --> 00:44:14,777
You can stop speaking formally now.
I went overboard. I'm sorry, okay?

543
00:44:14,860 --> 00:44:16,445
You haven't been happy recently.

544
00:44:17,821 --> 00:44:19,531
And that's all because of me.

545
00:44:19,657 --> 00:44:22,868
He's doing things he never did before,
and even things he shouldn't do.

546
00:44:22,951 --> 00:44:26,622
He's following an abnormal algorithm,
internalizing another's pain as his own.

547
00:44:29,416 --> 00:44:30,542
No way.

548
00:44:31,251 --> 00:44:34,380
That's why he's going against
his programming and breaking rules.

549
00:44:34,463 --> 00:44:37,591
I never programmed...
an algorithm like that into him.

550
00:44:42,304 --> 00:44:44,098
How is this possible?

551
00:44:44,682 --> 00:44:45,641
Can I...

552
00:44:46,350 --> 00:44:47,685
ask you something?

553
00:44:49,728 --> 00:44:53,148
-What is it?
-Do you think...

554
00:44:54,108 --> 00:44:57,945
that a person and an AI...
could fall in love?

555
00:45:00,656 --> 00:45:04,076
I told you that knowing something
is different from experiencing it, right?

556
00:45:04,159 --> 00:45:07,955
It's very difficult for an AI
to experience a complicated emotion

557
00:45:08,831 --> 00:45:10,082
like a person.

558
00:45:10,165 --> 00:45:14,294
Up until not too long ago,
I thought I understood human emotions.

559
00:45:15,462 --> 00:45:17,464
But actually, I knew nothing about them.

560
00:45:17,715 --> 00:45:21,677
You can't be certain yet, though.
Even if Holo has evolved, he can't--

561
00:45:21,760 --> 00:45:24,847
It's for the same reason
I've been doing things I never do.

562
00:45:24,930 --> 00:45:27,933
And why I couldn't take back the glasses,
though I should have.

563
00:45:28,016 --> 00:45:31,228
And why I hang around and watch her,
despite saying I'm not interested.

564
00:45:31,311 --> 00:45:33,647
Well, that's
because she's doing the beta testing.

565
00:45:33,731 --> 00:45:36,358
It's for the same reason
why I get weak seeing her suffer.

566
00:45:37,317 --> 00:45:38,819
It's why I canceled the rollback

567
00:45:38,902 --> 00:45:41,655
and said things to comfort her
while pretending to be Holo.

568
00:45:44,116 --> 00:45:46,285
For the same reason
I've done all these things

569
00:45:46,869 --> 00:45:48,412
that I'd usually never do.

570
00:45:54,501 --> 00:45:55,711
What could that reason be?

571
00:45:55,794 --> 00:45:58,964
Even humans are not fully aware
of how their feelings work.

572
00:45:59,047 --> 00:46:01,550
But that's something
that is unacceptable for an AI.

573
00:46:01,884 --> 00:46:04,887
And if a human
were to fall in love with such an AI,

574
00:46:07,097 --> 00:46:09,349
they'd never have
their feelings reciprocated.

575
00:46:09,433 --> 00:46:10,934
In short, it's impossible.

576
00:46:16,064 --> 00:46:17,191
Yeah.

577
00:46:18,066 --> 00:46:19,485
I thought so.

578
00:46:19,902 --> 00:46:21,195
So you're basically saying

579
00:46:21,278 --> 00:46:24,782
that everything about Holo
you thought was an error

580
00:46:24,865 --> 00:46:27,826
happened because Holo has fallen in love
with Han So-yeon?

581
00:46:28,577 --> 00:46:31,371
Yes, because Holo's error
is the same as mine.

582
00:46:37,419 --> 00:46:38,670
Hey, Boss.

583
00:46:38,754 --> 00:46:42,382
I was tracing all the numbers
from that cell phone, and one popped up.

584
00:46:42,466 --> 00:46:43,383
Where are they?

585
00:46:43,467 --> 00:46:45,385
They're near Magic Mirror's headquarters.

586
00:46:45,469 --> 00:46:47,387
They're even going after Magic Mirror now?

587
00:46:47,471 --> 00:46:51,266
No, that's not it.
That's where Miss Han's event is today.

588
00:46:52,851 --> 00:46:54,228
Han So-yeon is in danger.

589
00:47:01,527 --> 00:47:03,529
Why do you suddenly ask
something like that?

590
00:47:05,572 --> 00:47:06,615
Well...

591
00:47:11,870 --> 00:47:12,704
Holo.

592
00:47:16,250 --> 00:47:17,543
Holo.

593
00:47:37,896 --> 00:47:38,897
Who are you?

594
00:47:55,455 --> 00:47:57,416
There's no response from the Holo Glasses.

595
00:47:57,499 --> 00:47:59,751
I think someone deliberately
cut off the signal.

596
00:48:00,878 --> 00:48:01,879
Damn it!

597
00:48:10,596 --> 00:48:11,597
Oh, no!

598
00:48:13,807 --> 00:48:14,892
No.

599
00:48:28,906 --> 00:48:30,741
Holo, answer me. Holo.

600
00:48:31,074 --> 00:48:34,036
-I can't understand what he's saying.
-Where are you?

601
00:48:34,786 --> 00:48:35,996
Near the annex.

602
00:48:42,127 --> 00:48:44,630
Why isn't this working?
Why isn't my phone working?

603
00:49:00,187 --> 00:49:01,897
-What are you doing?
-Come with us.

604
00:49:01,980 --> 00:49:05,400
Stop it! Let go of me! I said let go!

605
00:49:06,860 --> 00:49:07,694
Jeez.

606
00:49:13,617 --> 00:49:14,785
Hurry up and go.

607
00:49:42,062 --> 00:49:43,146
Damn it.

608
00:49:51,113 --> 00:49:52,155
We've found them.

609
00:49:55,409 --> 00:49:56,576
-Run him over.
-Yes, sir.

610
00:50:05,627 --> 00:50:06,878
Holo!

611
00:50:09,673 --> 00:50:10,549
No!

612
00:50:25,230 --> 00:50:26,523
Han So-yeon.

613
00:50:26,606 --> 00:50:27,441
Han So-yeon!

614
00:50:29,151 --> 00:50:30,110
No...

615
00:50:31,028 --> 00:50:34,114
Han So-yeon.

616
00:50:35,991 --> 00:50:36,992
Han So-yeon!

617
00:50:40,871 --> 00:50:42,622
Han So-yeon!

618
00:50:43,081 --> 00:50:43,999
So-yeon!

619
00:50:44,458 --> 00:50:46,168
Han So-yeon!

620
00:50:48,045 --> 00:50:49,046
So-yeon!

621
00:50:54,968 --> 00:50:56,511
One, two, three, four.

622
00:51:04,436 --> 00:51:07,481
Han So-yeon! So-yeon!

623
00:51:24,081 --> 00:51:25,248
Han So-yeon!

624
00:51:25,332 --> 00:51:26,500
So-yeon!

625
00:51:27,084 --> 00:51:28,001
So-yeon!

626
00:51:32,798 --> 00:51:34,382
Han So-yeon!

627
00:51:34,466 --> 00:51:35,842
Han So-yeon.

628
00:51:50,565 --> 00:51:51,441
What?

629
00:51:53,443 --> 00:51:54,486
Holo...

630
00:51:56,905 --> 00:51:58,406
You're so handsome.

631
00:52:05,372 --> 00:52:07,791
So-yeon. Han So-yeon!
