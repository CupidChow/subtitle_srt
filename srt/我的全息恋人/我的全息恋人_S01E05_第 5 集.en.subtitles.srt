1
00:01:05,231 --> 00:01:08,193
I was worried about you, So-yeon.

2
00:01:08,443 --> 00:01:10,820
Can you see me?

3
00:01:11,279 --> 00:01:12,238
It's okay, So-yeon.

4
00:01:12,322 --> 00:01:14,449
-Are you okay, So-yeon?
-You're okay.

5
00:01:16,284 --> 00:01:17,118
By the way...

6
00:01:18,787 --> 00:01:20,705
those glasses look great on you.

7
00:01:27,212 --> 00:01:28,296
Holo...

8
00:01:29,672 --> 00:01:31,341
You're so handsome.

9
00:01:50,652 --> 00:01:51,569
HAN SO-YEON

10
00:01:53,238 --> 00:01:54,197
The glasses.

11
00:01:59,369 --> 00:02:01,162
Can you hear me, So-yeon?

12
00:02:03,123 --> 00:02:03,957
Are you okay?

13
00:02:10,296 --> 00:02:12,590
What's the matter? Is it hard to speak?

14
00:02:22,851 --> 00:02:23,685
What...

15
00:02:26,813 --> 00:02:27,647
So-yeon.

16
00:02:28,857 --> 00:02:29,691
I understand.

17
00:02:41,452 --> 00:02:43,454
Ma'am, I see that you're awake.

18
00:02:43,538 --> 00:02:44,789
I'll get the doctor.

19
00:02:49,085 --> 00:02:52,755
So-yeon. Let's go back inside.
You shouldn't be moving about.

20
00:02:56,968 --> 00:02:57,927
Holo.

21
00:02:59,345 --> 00:03:02,182
I can only see you.

22
00:03:02,265 --> 00:03:05,894
-I'm only looking at you, too.
-That's not what I mean.

23
00:03:06,477 --> 00:03:08,271
I can actually see your face.

24
00:03:09,147 --> 00:03:11,649
I can't see anyone else's,
but I can see yours.

25
00:03:11,733 --> 00:03:13,318
-My face?
-Yeah.

26
00:03:17,113 --> 00:03:18,364
I think I understand now.

27
00:03:21,326 --> 00:03:22,327
I love you.

28
00:03:30,752 --> 00:03:31,669
I love you too.

29
00:03:32,170 --> 00:03:33,838
No, what I mean is,

30
00:03:33,922 --> 00:03:36,966
I like you for real.

31
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:44,682
I know it makes no sense, but...

32
00:03:45,266 --> 00:03:48,102
that's why I've acted so strangely
around you lately.

33
00:03:48,603 --> 00:03:51,689
I kept denying it and resisting the idea,

34
00:03:52,065 --> 00:03:55,401
but I have no choice but to accept it
because I can only see your face.

35
00:03:55,818 --> 00:03:57,320
That's how I've already...

36
00:03:58,446 --> 00:03:59,906
grown to feel about you.

37
00:04:06,746 --> 00:04:07,705
I know.

38
00:04:07,956 --> 00:04:10,375
You said that this was impossible, but...

39
00:04:11,542 --> 00:04:13,753
I'm just telling you how I feel, so--

40
00:04:15,213 --> 00:04:17,632
Did you just hiccup, Holo?

41
00:04:24,889 --> 00:04:28,268
I’ve searched all the apartments
near the crash site, but I can’t find him.

42
00:04:28,351 --> 00:04:29,978
He hasn't come home either.

43
00:04:30,728 --> 00:04:32,105
Just come back for now.

44
00:04:33,398 --> 00:04:35,817
Where on earth is this punk?

45
00:04:36,651 --> 00:04:37,485
Ma'am.

46
00:04:47,245 --> 00:04:49,622
I'm not the only one seeing this, right?

47
00:04:52,792 --> 00:04:53,626
Go...

48
00:04:54,711 --> 00:04:56,379
Oh, he's the model.

49
00:04:56,462 --> 00:04:59,716
We called him in because we needed
additional facial data from him.

50
00:04:59,799 --> 00:05:02,010
That zoned-out expression is perfect.

51
00:05:02,468 --> 00:05:04,512
Come with me
so we can collect more data.

52
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:09,976
See? I told you I've seen him before.

53
00:05:10,059 --> 00:05:12,854
Wow, so Holo really is modeled
on a real person.

54
00:05:13,980 --> 00:05:16,316
What on earth are you doing?

55
00:05:16,649 --> 00:05:19,110
Do you know how much danger
you put yourself in?

56
00:05:19,193 --> 00:05:22,280
You almost died.
And the police were there too!

57
00:05:22,363 --> 00:05:23,364
She loves him!

58
00:05:25,074 --> 00:05:25,908
What?

59
00:05:26,492 --> 00:05:27,452
That's what...

60
00:05:28,369 --> 00:05:30,580
So-yeon said to Holo.

61
00:05:33,750 --> 00:05:34,667
I don't get it.

62
00:05:35,335 --> 00:05:38,046
My heart's being torn apart.
I feel like I'm going to die.

63
00:05:38,921 --> 00:05:41,341
Why do I feel like this?

64
00:05:45,178 --> 00:05:46,929
Congratulations on becoming manager.

65
00:05:47,013 --> 00:05:48,973
You're skipping out
on another team dinner?

66
00:05:49,057 --> 00:05:50,767
I was going to treat everyone, too.

67
00:05:50,850 --> 00:05:54,979
Don't say things like that to someone
who was hospitalized after a car accident.

68
00:05:55,313 --> 00:05:57,940
-How are you feeling?
-I didn't get too hurt, really.

69
00:05:58,024 --> 00:05:59,817
-I'll be discharged soon--
-No, don't.

70
00:05:59,901 --> 00:06:02,111
Your new manager is giving you permission

71
00:06:02,195 --> 00:06:04,655
to get some rest for a few days
and recover.

72
00:06:04,739 --> 00:06:07,450
That way, we'll be able to drink
as much as we want, right?

73
00:06:07,992 --> 00:06:09,285
Yes, ma'am.

74
00:06:12,038 --> 00:06:15,041
-Are we having a team dinner?
-After she gets out of the hospital.

75
00:06:15,124 --> 00:06:18,252
-Buy us something expensive.
-Why are you guys such freeloaders?

76
00:06:18,336 --> 00:06:21,506
I'll buy you guys dinner
after she gets discharged and gets better.

77
00:06:23,758 --> 00:06:26,302
You can only recognize certain faces
after the accident?

78
00:06:26,386 --> 00:06:27,387
Yes.

79
00:06:27,470 --> 00:06:30,306
I don't think you suffered a brain injury.

80
00:06:31,182 --> 00:06:34,977
It is rare, but not impossible,
for a person to develop face blindness

81
00:06:35,061 --> 00:06:36,729
due to psychological trauma.

82
00:06:49,367 --> 00:06:50,201
Holo.

83
00:06:51,327 --> 00:06:52,412
Sit here.

84
00:06:56,332 --> 00:06:57,667
Come closer.

85
00:07:00,586 --> 00:07:02,338
There's no medical explanation,

86
00:07:02,797 --> 00:07:04,966
but that person must be special enough
to you

87
00:07:05,049 --> 00:07:08,219
that they healed your trauma
at least a little bit.

88
00:07:08,719 --> 00:07:10,096
Stay just like that.

89
00:07:38,833 --> 00:07:41,294
-Hey, So-yeon...
-This is the first time

90
00:07:42,962 --> 00:07:47,925
ever since my childhood
that I can recognize someone's face.

91
00:07:51,888 --> 00:07:55,850
-So this is what you look like.
-Do you like what you see?

92
00:07:56,350 --> 00:07:57,185
Yeah.

93
00:07:58,186 --> 00:08:01,439
There's only one face in the whole world
that I can recognize,

94
00:08:01,522 --> 00:08:02,899
and I'm happy it's yours.

95
00:08:17,330 --> 00:08:18,247
Damn it.

96
00:08:22,084 --> 00:08:25,296
-What are you doing here? You didn't eat.
-I'm not hungry.

97
00:08:25,379 --> 00:08:27,673
Our investors are getting restless.

98
00:08:27,757 --> 00:08:29,884
They'll withdraw funds
if we don't launch soon.

99
00:08:29,967 --> 00:08:32,887
Also, the bastards after Holo
are getting bolder and bolder,

100
00:08:32,970 --> 00:08:34,472
and the police are involved.

101
00:08:34,555 --> 00:08:37,350
If we let Holo continue to stay
with that woman, they--

102
00:08:37,433 --> 00:08:39,894
-even you'll be in danger.
-I'll take care of it!

103
00:08:39,977 --> 00:08:41,103
Hey, seriously!

104
00:08:45,733 --> 00:08:47,235
I have something to report.

105
00:08:48,486 --> 00:08:51,280
You should focus on your user.
Why are you here?

106
00:08:51,364 --> 00:08:53,282
So-yeon told me she loves me.

107
00:09:00,915 --> 00:09:01,874
So what?

108
00:09:01,958 --> 00:09:05,336
I've calculated multiple possibilities,
and it's likely she's mistaken.

109
00:09:05,419 --> 00:09:06,295
"Mistaken"?

110
00:09:06,379 --> 00:09:09,131
The ultimate reason
why she started thinking she loves me

111
00:09:09,215 --> 00:09:13,219
is because she can recognize my face.
That's really meaningful to her.

112
00:09:13,302 --> 00:09:14,220
And?

113
00:09:14,303 --> 00:09:17,848
But it's highly probable
that the face she actually saw was yours.

114
00:09:18,307 --> 00:09:20,768
So-yeon was able to see
the face of the person

115
00:09:20,851 --> 00:09:23,771
who saved her life when she was in danger.
That person was you.

116
00:09:24,313 --> 00:09:26,816
But So-yeon doesn't know
you and I have the same face.

117
00:09:26,899 --> 00:09:30,111
She thinks the fact she can see my face
is evidence that she loves me.

118
00:09:30,194 --> 00:09:32,154
-So?
-We need to set the record straight.

119
00:09:32,238 --> 00:09:34,907
We have to tell her it's
because we look the same

120
00:09:34,991 --> 00:09:37,451
and that she's mistaken
about her feelings.

121
00:09:39,328 --> 00:09:41,163
-You tell her.
-Why should I?

122
00:09:41,247 --> 00:09:44,458
Because she won't believe it
unless she sees your face.

123
00:09:44,542 --> 00:09:47,253
Help me. So-yeon will become miserable
if we keep this up

124
00:09:47,837 --> 00:09:50,172
because I'm just an AI
who can't fall in love.

125
00:09:53,676 --> 00:09:57,430
Nan-do, meet with So-yeon and solve this.
If she sees your face--

126
00:09:57,680 --> 00:09:59,515
Shut up!

127
00:10:00,641 --> 00:10:02,059
That makes no sense.

128
00:10:02,143 --> 00:10:04,729
Who cares if it makes sense or not?
Just do it.

129
00:10:04,812 --> 00:10:07,106
-What?
-It's for the best, anyway.

130
00:10:07,523 --> 00:10:09,233
Let's end the beta test here.

131
00:10:10,484 --> 00:10:14,530
We have a perfect excuse now.
Go to Han So-yeon, show her your face.

132
00:10:14,614 --> 00:10:17,158
Tell her that the face she can see now
is your face,

133
00:10:17,241 --> 00:10:18,701
that her feelings aren't real,

134
00:10:18,784 --> 00:10:21,662
and that it's not love,
so she needs to give us the glasses.

135
00:10:21,746 --> 00:10:25,666
Do you also think she made a mistake
because she can see his face?

136
00:10:25,833 --> 00:10:28,836
You want me to split them up
just because we have an excuse now?

137
00:10:28,919 --> 00:10:31,756
I can't do that to either So-yeon or Holo.

138
00:10:31,839 --> 00:10:33,841
Why didn't you tell Holo just now

139
00:10:34,258 --> 00:10:37,261
that he's capable of love
so he should make Han So-yeon happy?

140
00:10:37,345 --> 00:10:39,138
-Because--
-You didn't want to tell him

141
00:10:39,221 --> 00:10:42,183
because you like her!
You don't want to lose her to your AI!

142
00:10:42,266 --> 00:10:43,976
Yes! I don't like it, and I'm angry.

143
00:10:45,770 --> 00:10:48,689
And I feel like I'm going to go insane!
But the thing is...

144
00:10:50,232 --> 00:10:51,525
Damn it.

145
00:10:52,068 --> 00:10:54,862
Whatever the situation may be,
there's only one thing to do.

146
00:10:54,945 --> 00:10:57,782
If you keep postponing the launch date
due to the beta test,

147
00:10:57,865 --> 00:10:58,908
the company's doomed.

148
00:11:07,166 --> 00:11:09,460
Give me that thing I mentioned earlier.

149
00:11:11,712 --> 00:11:14,173
DISAPPEARED AFTER CRASHING
INTO TELEPHONE POLE,

150
00:11:14,256 --> 00:11:15,758
IMPOSSIBLE TO IDENTIFY

151
00:11:15,841 --> 00:11:16,759
Here.

152
00:11:23,015 --> 00:11:26,102
The blackout occurred at 10:03 p.m.

153
00:11:26,769 --> 00:11:31,315
Han So-yeon and the man dressed in black
who seems like the suspect

154
00:11:31,399 --> 00:11:33,651
were just about to be electrocuted
to death.

155
00:11:34,068 --> 00:11:36,153
But the blackout saved their lives.

156
00:11:36,237 --> 00:11:38,447
This is similar to what happened
yesterday too.

157
00:11:52,378 --> 00:11:56,799
-This can't be just a coincidence.
-Wouldn't it be even weirder if it wasn't?

158
00:11:56,882 --> 00:11:59,927
I've never heard of anyone
who's capable of hacking so quickly

159
00:12:00,010 --> 00:12:01,053
on such a large scale.

160
00:12:01,846 --> 00:12:07,393
One thing's for sure. This man is involved
in both of these hacking cases.

161
00:12:07,518 --> 00:12:09,812
But how do we catch him?

162
00:12:09,895 --> 00:12:14,316
We don't have his ID, and nobody knows
anything about him. He's like a ghost.

163
00:12:15,151 --> 00:12:16,569
I don't have any leads on him,

164
00:12:16,652 --> 00:12:19,864
but I looked into the cars
involved in the accident yesterday.

165
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:30,332
Yeah, we might make more progress
looking into these guys first.

166
00:12:33,836 --> 00:12:37,465
You never cease to disappoint me.

167
00:12:38,174 --> 00:12:41,469
How much more must you disappoint me
until you're satisfied?

168
00:12:41,552 --> 00:12:44,138
Please give me one last chance, Father.

169
00:12:44,555 --> 00:12:46,015
This time, I'll definitely...

170
00:13:03,073 --> 00:13:04,658
VICE PRESIDENT BAEK CHAN-SUNG

171
00:13:17,087 --> 00:13:20,591
You're getting discharged already?
Just wait. I'll get my car.

172
00:13:20,674 --> 00:13:22,593
It's fine. I know you're busy.

173
00:13:22,676 --> 00:13:25,346
Why, is someone else giving you a ride?

174
00:13:25,429 --> 00:13:27,765
-No.
-Don't lie. Who is it?

175
00:13:27,890 --> 00:13:30,059
You've been acting really weird recently.

176
00:13:30,142 --> 00:13:31,519
Hey, let's talk later.

177
00:13:34,104 --> 00:13:35,397
-Holo.
-Yeah?

178
00:13:35,481 --> 00:13:39,777
I want to eat something really delicious
after all this hospital food.

179
00:13:39,860 --> 00:13:41,445
Shall I find restaurants?

180
00:13:41,529 --> 00:13:45,241
-No. How about we cook something at home?
-At home?

181
00:13:48,285 --> 00:13:49,119
Jeez.

182
00:13:49,995 --> 00:13:51,372
What should we eat?

183
00:13:51,789 --> 00:13:52,790
Any ideas?

184
00:14:00,714 --> 00:14:04,009
Gosh, look at how big this is.
Should we grill this or steam it?

185
00:14:04,093 --> 00:14:05,135
-Hey, So-yeon.
-Yes?

186
00:14:05,219 --> 00:14:06,095
Don't go overboard.

187
00:14:06,178 --> 00:14:08,806
-How about something simpler?
-Live squids are half-price

188
00:14:08,889 --> 00:14:11,100
for the next hour! Come and get them!

189
00:14:11,183 --> 00:14:13,352
-They're half-price!
-This is an amazing deal!

190
00:14:14,186 --> 00:14:15,896
These squids are super fresh!

191
00:14:15,980 --> 00:14:19,108
-Gosh, you got here quickly.
-How much are these?

192
00:14:19,191 --> 00:14:21,735
I'll give you the total price
once you pick them out.

193
00:14:29,869 --> 00:14:30,786
Come here.

194
00:14:30,870 --> 00:14:32,705
The squids are super fresh today.

195
00:14:32,788 --> 00:14:34,874
Look at these.
They look super fresh, right?

196
00:14:34,957 --> 00:14:37,543
-How many would you like? Four?
-Four? Wait, no.

197
00:14:37,626 --> 00:14:38,669
Give me ten.

198
00:14:38,752 --> 00:14:39,837
Okay, ten.

199
00:14:43,632 --> 00:14:44,508
Bell peppers.

200
00:14:46,302 --> 00:14:47,261
Zucchini.

201
00:14:48,804 --> 00:14:49,722
Broccoli.

202
00:14:49,805 --> 00:14:50,973
Mushrooms.

203
00:14:55,561 --> 00:14:56,645
Hurry up!

204
00:14:57,771 --> 00:14:59,231
Try a sample.

205
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:04,403
-Try it.
-Sure.

206
00:15:06,947 --> 00:15:08,991
Yum, this is so good. Should we buy one?

207
00:15:12,369 --> 00:15:16,290
I should buy one. Where can I find these?

208
00:15:16,373 --> 00:15:17,875
-Over there.
-I see.

209
00:15:17,958 --> 00:15:19,668
Here they are. Thank you.

210
00:15:30,679 --> 00:15:31,555
Oh, gosh.

211
00:15:31,639 --> 00:15:33,807
You've never cleaned
a squid before, have you?

212
00:15:35,559 --> 00:15:38,437
Why do you think my mom always
brings side dishes over for me?

213
00:15:38,520 --> 00:15:39,521
I can't cook.

214
00:15:40,314 --> 00:15:42,858
It's okay. Thankfully,
we have plenty of ingredients.

215
00:15:44,693 --> 00:15:45,653
Right?

216
00:15:47,446 --> 00:15:48,656
Okay, one more time.

217
00:15:51,325 --> 00:15:55,412
-Wow, that looks good on you.
-Let's throw these out and start fresh.

218
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:00,584
All right.

219
00:16:01,251 --> 00:16:03,253
-I'll show you how to do it.
-Okay.

220
00:16:04,630 --> 00:16:05,631
Okay.

221
00:16:08,676 --> 00:16:11,345
-First, flip the squid over.
-Okay.

222
00:16:12,054 --> 00:16:13,097
Flip it over.

223
00:16:14,264 --> 00:16:16,600
Then cut down the middle with scissors.

224
00:16:16,684 --> 00:16:17,559
Cut.

225
00:16:19,812 --> 00:16:22,439
Hold the squid down, and...

226
00:16:22,523 --> 00:16:23,482
Gosh.

227
00:16:23,565 --> 00:16:24,400
Harder.

228
00:16:24,942 --> 00:16:26,527
Good. Great job.

229
00:16:27,027 --> 00:16:29,738
-Then salt the outside.
-Salt.

230
00:16:29,822 --> 00:16:31,448
-Pat, pat, pat.
-Pat, pat, pat.

231
00:16:31,532 --> 00:16:35,828
Then grab the ends of the squid and pull.

232
00:16:36,412 --> 00:16:37,955
Nice and easy.

233
00:16:39,873 --> 00:16:40,833
Wait.

234
00:16:42,376 --> 00:16:44,378
Have you decided
what you're going to make?

235
00:16:44,461 --> 00:16:45,379
What?

236
00:16:52,302 --> 00:16:53,345
Here.

237
00:16:55,764 --> 00:16:56,765
Wow!

238
00:16:57,057 --> 00:17:00,227
I can't believe I made this.
What's the name of the dish again?

239
00:17:00,310 --> 00:17:02,062
Lemon calamari cream risotto.

240
00:17:02,479 --> 00:17:04,273
Lemon calamari cream risotto.

241
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:07,568
This is lemon calamari cream risotto
that I made. Okay.

242
00:17:15,617 --> 00:17:18,954
What's the matter? I saw you burned
the rice a bit earlier, but...

243
00:17:20,164 --> 00:17:22,166
This is exactly what I wanted.

244
00:17:23,375 --> 00:17:24,460
It's delicious.

245
00:17:27,546 --> 00:17:31,175
Hey, So-yeon.
About what you said last time...

246
00:17:33,010 --> 00:17:34,011
I know.

247
00:17:34,344 --> 00:17:38,348
You're trying to say that it's impossible
for an AI and a human to fall in love.

248
00:17:38,432 --> 00:17:40,976
There's also something else
you should know.

249
00:17:41,101 --> 00:17:45,647
I know it'll be hard for you to accept,
but I think it's for the best.

250
00:17:45,731 --> 00:17:47,316
Wow, this is so good.

251
00:17:47,399 --> 00:17:49,276
I'm already really happy now.

252
00:17:49,693 --> 00:17:51,987
Can't you keep making me happy
as you're doing now?

253
00:17:52,071 --> 00:17:54,823
-Still.
-Let's go shopping tomorrow.

254
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:57,701
You've been wearing the same outfit
because of me.

255
00:17:57,785 --> 00:17:59,661
But since I can recognize your face now,

256
00:17:59,745 --> 00:18:02,915
you can wear different outfits
every day now, okay?

257
00:18:10,380 --> 00:18:13,342
-You can't go in right now.
-Oh, whatever.

258
00:18:15,052 --> 00:18:16,303
CEO Jang.

259
00:18:17,763 --> 00:18:20,641
I wasn't expecting you.
To what do I owe the pleasure?

260
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:22,518
You know why I'm here.

261
00:18:22,601 --> 00:18:24,269
Of course.

262
00:18:25,187 --> 00:18:28,107
-Can you bring us some coffee, Mr. Kim?
-Right away.

263
00:18:29,191 --> 00:18:32,111
You want to know about
the progress of the beta test, right?

264
00:18:32,194 --> 00:18:35,656
Holo is exceeding our expectations,
and we're all stunned by him.

265
00:18:35,739 --> 00:18:37,574
The user's satisfaction is high, too.

266
00:18:37,658 --> 00:18:38,784
I've heard a rumor...

267
00:18:39,868 --> 00:18:43,872
that you're pushing back the launch date
because you found a critical error.

268
00:18:44,373 --> 00:18:47,626
Well, that's quite different
from what I've heard.

269
00:18:47,709 --> 00:18:50,838
Word is that someone
has been leaking false information

270
00:18:50,921 --> 00:18:53,173
about some nonexistent error
to our investors.

271
00:18:53,549 --> 00:18:55,968
If you don't set a launch date
within a week,

272
00:18:56,051 --> 00:18:58,762
we'll be withdrawing all of our funds
from GIO Lab.

273
00:18:58,846 --> 00:18:59,930
I see.

274
00:19:00,222 --> 00:19:01,682
Well, it's a shame

275
00:19:01,765 --> 00:19:04,977
that you're trying to kill the goose
before it can lay its golden egg.

276
00:19:05,394 --> 00:19:07,271
We'll have to start searching

277
00:19:07,354 --> 00:19:10,315
for a more patient investor
to replace you, then.

278
00:19:10,482 --> 00:19:14,194
I'm here to tell you this on behalf
of all the other investors.

279
00:19:14,319 --> 00:19:17,447
If you refuse to announce a launch date
within a week despite this,

280
00:19:17,531 --> 00:19:21,160
the rumors
will prove themselves to be true,

281
00:19:21,243 --> 00:19:23,370
and you won't be able to find
more investors.

282
00:19:33,422 --> 00:19:36,592
I guess he doesn't like coffee.
You can have the other cup, Mr. Kim.

283
00:19:36,675 --> 00:19:37,593
Yes, ma'am.

284
00:19:52,733 --> 00:19:53,901
HOLO

285
00:19:58,655 --> 00:19:59,656
HOLO

286
00:20:01,408 --> 00:20:03,952
What? If it's about last time,
let's talk later.

287
00:20:04,036 --> 00:20:05,078
I'm busy.

288
00:20:05,162 --> 00:20:07,873
That's not it.
I just got a call from Miss Ko.

289
00:20:07,956 --> 00:20:10,834
She said she's going to meet So-yeon
because you won't.

290
00:20:10,918 --> 00:20:11,752
What?

291
00:20:14,588 --> 00:20:15,422
Holo.

292
00:20:16,715 --> 00:20:17,841
Come here.

293
00:20:19,384 --> 00:20:22,638
Wow, it feels so different now
that I can see your face.

294
00:20:23,347 --> 00:20:24,473
Want to try this on?

295
00:20:28,393 --> 00:20:29,269
How does it look?

296
00:20:30,562 --> 00:20:32,564
Brighter clothes look good on you.

297
00:20:32,648 --> 00:20:35,359
You look a bit standoffish
when you're not smiling.

298
00:20:36,610 --> 00:20:37,611
Let's go.

299
00:20:45,452 --> 00:20:46,453
Try this on too.

300
00:20:50,666 --> 00:20:53,502
-What are you doing?
-Something you should've done earlier.

301
00:20:54,169 --> 00:20:56,546
This isn't why you founded GIO Lab.

302
00:20:57,422 --> 00:21:00,050
We need to wrap things up
with those two now.

303
00:21:00,634 --> 00:21:02,469
I feel like it's missing something.

304
00:21:03,470 --> 00:21:05,973
All right, but I'll be the one to do it.

305
00:21:08,016 --> 00:21:09,059
Come on, Yoo-jin.

306
00:21:17,109 --> 00:21:18,694
Damn it.

307
00:21:34,251 --> 00:21:36,712
It's so funny when you hiccup, Holo.

308
00:21:37,379 --> 00:21:38,213
Well...

309
00:21:39,589 --> 00:21:42,676
so, the thing is...
I have something to tell you.

310
00:21:42,759 --> 00:21:44,928
Achromatic colors
look really good on you too.

311
00:21:45,012 --> 00:21:46,888
Sure, but I have to tell you something--

312
00:21:46,972 --> 00:21:49,516
Let's go. We're done with your outfit now.
Follow me.

313
00:21:56,273 --> 00:22:00,193
She keeps changing the subject
when I start talking about serious things.

314
00:22:00,277 --> 00:22:01,403
Jeez.

315
00:22:02,070 --> 00:22:06,074
I'll start telling her about it.
Show up later and explain the rest.

316
00:22:06,283 --> 00:22:08,243
That way, she'll be less shocked.

317
00:22:22,591 --> 00:22:23,550
I must be crazy.

318
00:22:39,816 --> 00:22:41,318
HOLO

319
00:22:41,902 --> 00:22:42,819
Damn it.

320
00:22:43,528 --> 00:22:44,696
HOLO

321
00:22:46,031 --> 00:22:46,865
SPEAKERPHONE

322
00:22:46,948 --> 00:22:49,826
-What are you doing?
-I'm not mentally prepared yet.

323
00:22:49,951 --> 00:22:52,079
So you're going to keep pretending
to be me?

324
00:22:52,162 --> 00:22:54,164
Why are you being so laid-back about this?

325
00:22:54,289 --> 00:22:56,333
All right, okay! I get it!

326
00:23:04,925 --> 00:23:07,803
Are you not ready?
You picked up dancing so quickly, though.

327
00:23:07,886 --> 00:23:09,429
Well, the thing is...

328
00:23:10,263 --> 00:23:13,642
I'm analyzing the moves of the skaters
who competed in the Winter Olympics.

329
00:23:13,725 --> 00:23:15,310
Are you going to do a triple Lutz?

330
00:23:15,394 --> 00:23:17,396
It's fine, so hurry.
Skating alone is boring.

331
00:23:17,479 --> 00:23:19,856
All right. Just give me a few minutes.

332
00:23:24,361 --> 00:23:25,487
Damn it.

333
00:23:32,202 --> 00:23:33,120
Okay.

334
00:23:33,870 --> 00:23:34,871
Damn it.

335
00:23:36,039 --> 00:23:37,666
Excuse me!

336
00:23:37,749 --> 00:23:40,460
You can't go on the ice with sneakers on.

337
00:23:40,544 --> 00:23:41,586
Damn it.

338
00:23:41,837 --> 00:23:43,547
-Are you okay?
-I need to talk to her.

339
00:23:43,630 --> 00:23:45,465
-You can't. You'll get hurt.
-I'm sorry.

340
00:23:45,549 --> 00:23:47,300
I won't get hurt.

341
00:23:47,384 --> 00:23:49,052
I told you, you'll get hurt!

342
00:23:49,469 --> 00:23:51,221
Okay, 100,000 won, every ten minutes.

343
00:23:51,304 --> 00:23:53,140
Stop it! You'll get hurt.

344
00:23:53,223 --> 00:23:55,517
-I have to talk to her for a second!
-You can't.

345
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:56,476
Wow!

346
00:23:56,893 --> 00:23:59,646
-I don't think so.
-All right, fine.

347
00:24:05,402 --> 00:24:06,653
Fine, whatever.

348
00:24:06,987 --> 00:24:08,405
I'll just go for it.

349
00:24:09,281 --> 00:24:10,657
Just go for it.

350
00:24:59,039 --> 00:25:00,999
There's nothing you can't do. As expected.

351
00:25:01,082 --> 00:25:02,292
Hey.

352
00:25:02,709 --> 00:25:04,419
-Let's talk--
-Let's go.

353
00:25:06,129 --> 00:25:07,464
Damn it.

354
00:25:35,867 --> 00:25:37,536
Hey...

355
00:25:39,079 --> 00:25:39,996
Gosh.

356
00:25:46,086 --> 00:25:47,295
What's that?

357
00:25:48,004 --> 00:25:49,172
HURRY UP AND SAY IT

358
00:25:49,256 --> 00:25:50,632
"Hurry up and say it?"

359
00:25:50,715 --> 00:25:52,926
Well, I don't know.

360
00:25:53,093 --> 00:25:55,679
Look. They must be having
a special event or something.

361
00:25:56,012 --> 00:25:58,598
-Hey, do you want to go out with me?
-What?

362
00:25:58,682 --> 00:26:01,643
I just felt like I had to say it
after seeing that.

363
00:26:02,018 --> 00:26:03,270
That took you a long time.

364
00:26:05,897 --> 00:26:07,274
They're so cute.

365
00:26:08,984 --> 00:26:10,527
That crazy jerk.

366
00:26:10,610 --> 00:26:12,779
HURRY UP AND SAY IT

367
00:26:16,283 --> 00:26:20,370
It's so nice
to walk side by side with you like this.

368
00:26:21,079 --> 00:26:24,624
It's not a short distance.
Did you really want to walk all this way?

369
00:26:25,542 --> 00:26:30,171
It's scary to walk alone at night,
and it's even worse with face blindness.

370
00:26:30,922 --> 00:26:34,509
So I used to be scared just to go
to the local grocery store at night.

371
00:26:37,012 --> 00:26:41,016
But I'm not scared anymore,
now that I have you and can see your face.

372
00:26:43,226 --> 00:26:45,061
Look at me, Han So-yeon.

373
00:26:45,937 --> 00:26:46,813
Yes?

374
00:26:51,192 --> 00:26:55,113
What if, hypothetically speaking,

375
00:26:56,573 --> 00:26:59,075
there was someone who looked just like me?

376
00:27:01,494 --> 00:27:04,748
Someone who looked just like you?

377
00:27:04,831 --> 00:27:07,000
Yeah. Not a hologram but a real person.

378
00:27:07,626 --> 00:27:11,713
If there were a person...
I mean, if you met someone like that--

379
00:27:11,796 --> 00:27:13,089
Don't be silly.

380
00:27:15,425 --> 00:27:19,054
I don't think it's because I saw your face
that I fell in love with you.

381
00:27:19,137 --> 00:27:21,056
I recognized your face because I love you.

382
00:27:22,307 --> 00:27:23,808
That's what I'm going to believe.

383
00:27:23,892 --> 00:27:25,018
-What?
-So,

384
00:27:25,101 --> 00:27:27,520
even if I met a person
who looks just like you,

385
00:27:27,604 --> 00:27:30,315
I wouldn't start liking them.
That's what I'm trying to say.

386
00:27:33,693 --> 00:27:34,861
I think I get

387
00:27:35,528 --> 00:27:37,280
what you're trying to say...

388
00:27:38,698 --> 00:27:41,034
but no pressure.

389
00:27:41,117 --> 00:27:46,039
It's just that everything that you did
for me felt like an act of love.

390
00:27:47,290 --> 00:27:49,668
When I realized that,
I was able to see your face.

391
00:27:49,751 --> 00:27:50,794
It was like a miracle.

392
00:27:50,877 --> 00:27:52,837
-"A miracle"?
-Yeah.

393
00:27:52,921 --> 00:27:56,716
Every moment felt like an act of love?
And that's why you can see my face?

394
00:27:56,800 --> 00:27:59,552
Hey, that's enough.

395
00:27:59,636 --> 00:28:03,765
I've become the first woman in history
to develop unrequited feelings for an AI.

396
00:28:04,015 --> 00:28:05,934
So just stay by my side, as you have--

397
00:28:06,017 --> 00:28:07,894
I'm telling you, that's a mistake--

398
00:28:07,977 --> 00:28:08,937
So-yeon!

399
00:28:12,148 --> 00:28:13,316
Mom!

400
00:28:30,250 --> 00:28:31,251
So-yeon.

401
00:28:38,425 --> 00:28:40,427
Where on earth have you been?

402
00:28:40,510 --> 00:28:43,596
-I heard you got into a car accident, too.
-It was no big deal.

403
00:28:44,180 --> 00:28:45,598
Are you hurt at all?

404
00:28:45,682 --> 00:28:48,309
You didn't pick up my calls or anything.
I was so worried!

405
00:28:48,393 --> 00:28:50,729
-So I had to rush over here!
-Let's head inside.

406
00:28:50,812 --> 00:28:52,105
-Let's go.
-Let's go inside.

407
00:28:52,188 --> 00:28:53,064
Are you in pain?

408
00:28:53,148 --> 00:28:54,607
-I'm fine.
-Really? Are you sure?

409
00:29:01,030 --> 00:29:03,908
Why are you dragging this out?
This isn't like you.

410
00:29:04,242 --> 00:29:07,203
I won't drag this out any longer.
I'll end this.

411
00:29:07,287 --> 00:29:08,747
I'll end it right now.

412
00:29:08,830 --> 00:29:10,915
What? What do you mean by that?

413
00:29:11,207 --> 00:29:12,041
Go away.

414
00:29:15,003 --> 00:29:17,630
I'm glad that you're okay and all, but...

415
00:29:18,882 --> 00:29:22,677
-You went grocery shopping?
-What? Oh, yeah.

416
00:29:22,761 --> 00:29:24,721
You actually cooked something at home?

417
00:29:24,804 --> 00:29:25,972
All by yourself?

418
00:29:29,267 --> 00:29:33,897
No, I was planning to make something
with Yoo-ram, but she said she was busy.

419
00:29:34,606 --> 00:29:36,357
Well, Yoo-ram told me that...

420
00:29:37,150 --> 00:29:40,111
she offered to pick you up,
but you told her not to.

421
00:29:41,571 --> 00:29:44,949
Are you dating someone? Who is this guy?

422
00:29:45,033 --> 00:29:46,868
What are you talking about? Come on.

423
00:29:47,452 --> 00:29:49,621
I should clean this up.
I'll go throw this out.

424
00:29:53,374 --> 00:29:54,417
Okay.

425
00:30:10,809 --> 00:30:12,727
Wait, why am I hiding?

426
00:30:15,688 --> 00:30:16,523
HOLO

427
00:30:16,606 --> 00:30:17,857
Damn it.

428
00:30:19,025 --> 00:30:20,985
All right, okay! I'm doing it!

429
00:30:25,031 --> 00:30:26,157
Okay.

430
00:30:27,909 --> 00:30:29,202
That startled me.

431
00:30:34,624 --> 00:30:36,751
I know you're there. Open the door.

432
00:30:36,835 --> 00:30:38,086
Oh, no...

433
00:30:39,295 --> 00:30:41,214
Goodness me.

434
00:30:42,549 --> 00:30:45,176
The house is as empty as ever. Jeez.

435
00:30:45,260 --> 00:30:47,637
Excuse me, what brings you here, ma'am?

436
00:30:47,720 --> 00:30:48,972
I saw you hiding earlier.

437
00:30:49,055 --> 00:30:50,974
-Pardon?
-How long has this been going on?

438
00:30:51,057 --> 00:30:54,060
Did So-yeon tell you
that she wanted you to go hide?

439
00:30:54,769 --> 00:30:57,230
Well, the thing is...

440
00:30:57,814 --> 00:30:59,190
Do you actually like So-yeon?

441
00:31:02,610 --> 00:31:03,444
Yes.

442
00:31:03,820 --> 00:31:04,904
I do like her.

443
00:31:08,157 --> 00:31:12,287
Did she tell you?
She's a bit different from other people.

444
00:31:12,370 --> 00:31:14,414
I know that she has face blindness.

445
00:31:14,497 --> 00:31:16,583
Gosh, did she tell you that?

446
00:31:16,666 --> 00:31:18,293
No, not exactly.

447
00:31:19,377 --> 00:31:22,672
-I just ended up finding out.
-I see.

448
00:31:25,008 --> 00:31:26,634
You're not what I expected.

449
00:31:34,559 --> 00:31:37,228
Gosh, Yoo-ram, that rat.

450
00:31:37,312 --> 00:31:39,147
Why did she tell my mom that?

451
00:31:39,230 --> 00:31:41,733
She probably told her
someone got you from the hospital.

452
00:31:41,816 --> 00:31:43,109
I'm sure it's nothing.

453
00:31:46,529 --> 00:31:48,031
You're not going to head back?

454
00:31:49,032 --> 00:31:52,660
My mom has really sharp intuition.

455
00:31:53,202 --> 00:31:55,747
-She might force it out of me.
-"Intuition"?

456
00:31:56,706 --> 00:31:57,582
"Force it out"?

457
00:32:00,293 --> 00:32:02,754
Why did you change your outfit
all of a sudden,

458
00:32:02,837 --> 00:32:03,713
-by the way?
-What?

459
00:32:06,591 --> 00:32:10,470
Oh, because you told me
that brighter clothes suit me better.

460
00:32:10,553 --> 00:32:12,764
And you picked these out for me, too.

461
00:32:13,389 --> 00:32:15,141
That looks good on you.

462
00:32:20,063 --> 00:32:22,690
It's so obvious to me.

463
00:32:22,774 --> 00:32:25,735
It's so easy to tell
when she has a crush on someone.

464
00:32:28,237 --> 00:32:31,783
It must've been so hard for So-yeon
to have stopped being able to recognize

465
00:32:31,866 --> 00:32:36,037
even her own parents' faces
at such an early age.

466
00:32:38,373 --> 00:32:42,835
After I divorced her dad,
I struggled so much as a single mom

467
00:32:43,878 --> 00:32:46,422
that I didn't take good enough care
of her.

468
00:32:46,506 --> 00:32:51,260
So I always wanted her to meet someone
who was loved a lot as a kid

469
00:32:53,179 --> 00:32:55,890
so that he could care for her.

470
00:32:56,808 --> 00:32:59,310
That's what I always thought.

471
00:33:03,606 --> 00:33:07,235
But I think you'll do just fine.

472
00:33:11,322 --> 00:33:13,157
Please take good care of her.

473
00:33:15,118 --> 00:33:16,160
Yes, ma'am.

474
00:33:18,204 --> 00:33:19,831
I bet So-yeon will be back soon.

475
00:33:19,914 --> 00:33:22,792
I'll pretend I don't know anything
about this for now,

476
00:33:22,875 --> 00:33:24,043
-okay?
-All right.

477
00:33:25,628 --> 00:33:26,754
All right.

478
00:33:27,839 --> 00:33:29,590
Goodness. Are you all right?

479
00:33:29,674 --> 00:33:33,594
Oh, I'm fine. It's nothing.
It's just a part of getting old.

480
00:33:33,678 --> 00:33:34,637
-I see.
-Yes.

481
00:33:34,721 --> 00:33:36,055
-Get some rest.
-Let me--

482
00:33:36,139 --> 00:33:37,432
No need to see me out.

483
00:33:45,231 --> 00:33:47,734
Mom. What are you doing there?

484
00:33:49,318 --> 00:33:50,737
Something's off about her.

485
00:33:52,572 --> 00:33:53,781
Mom!

486
00:33:54,282 --> 00:33:56,409
Mom, are you okay?

487
00:33:56,492 --> 00:33:58,953
It's nothing. I'm fine.

488
00:34:00,204 --> 00:34:03,416
Mom. Wake up, Mom!

489
00:34:03,499 --> 00:34:06,544
I've called an ambulance.
They'll be here in around ten minutes.

490
00:34:06,836 --> 00:34:08,046
Ten minutes?

491
00:34:08,838 --> 00:34:10,715
Mom.

492
00:34:13,009 --> 00:34:13,843
Mom!

493
00:34:15,845 --> 00:34:17,096
Get her on my back.

494
00:34:17,889 --> 00:34:18,723
Next-door guy...

495
00:34:18,806 --> 00:34:21,184
-Hurry up!
-The ambulance is on its way.

496
00:34:21,267 --> 00:34:22,727
It'll be faster to drive there.

497
00:34:22,810 --> 00:34:24,979
If we do that,
it'll take around 25 minutes.

498
00:34:25,063 --> 00:34:27,106
It's better to wait for the ambulance.

499
00:34:29,317 --> 00:34:31,402
Gosh, what do I do?

500
00:34:31,486 --> 00:34:33,237
Mom! Wake up.

501
00:34:33,321 --> 00:34:35,198
Mom!

502
00:34:35,281 --> 00:34:36,407
Han So-yeon!

503
00:34:36,866 --> 00:34:40,078
Calm down. I'll drive as fast as I can
and ignore the traffic lights.

504
00:34:40,161 --> 00:34:42,622
I'll run with her on my back if needed.
I'll be faster.

505
00:34:43,206 --> 00:34:44,582
It's okay. Put her on my back.

506
00:34:46,876 --> 00:34:47,710
Mom.

507
00:34:57,720 --> 00:35:00,598
It seems to be a side effect
of her antihypertensive medication.

508
00:35:00,681 --> 00:35:03,976
It sometimes causes blood pressure
to drop and causes fainting.

509
00:35:04,143 --> 00:35:08,272
And that sometimes causes people
to injure their heads, like your mother.

510
00:35:09,273 --> 00:35:12,819
She was...
taking antihypertensive medication?

511
00:35:12,902 --> 00:35:14,070
You didn't know?

512
00:35:27,083 --> 00:35:28,251
Mom.

513
00:35:30,962 --> 00:35:31,963
I'm sorry.

514
00:35:32,755 --> 00:35:34,882
I had no idea.

515
00:35:58,072 --> 00:35:59,323
Excuse me!

516
00:36:00,366 --> 00:36:01,450
Excuse me.

517
00:36:06,122 --> 00:36:07,039
Thank you.

518
00:36:11,878 --> 00:36:13,212
Don't mention it.

519
00:36:17,383 --> 00:36:18,509
Goodbye, then.

520
00:37:00,092 --> 00:37:01,093
Holo.

521
00:37:05,139 --> 00:37:06,390
How is So-yeon doing?

522
00:37:06,474 --> 00:37:09,810
She's sad,
but there's nothing I can do for her.

523
00:37:09,894 --> 00:37:10,978
That's not true.

524
00:37:12,396 --> 00:37:14,857
You're the one who's the best
at making So-yeon happy.

525
00:37:14,941 --> 00:37:16,025
What are you saying?

526
00:37:16,108 --> 00:37:20,905
At first, I thought your abnormal behavior
was all because of an error.

527
00:37:20,988 --> 00:37:23,407
You finding So-yeon while on the run,

528
00:37:24,033 --> 00:37:26,077
agreeing to the beta test
without resisting.

529
00:37:26,535 --> 00:37:29,247
You even hacked a car
and caused a blackout.

530
00:37:33,084 --> 00:37:34,293
But it wasn't an error.

531
00:37:35,336 --> 00:37:38,923
What made you break all those rules
for So-yeon...

532
00:37:39,507 --> 00:37:40,925
was love, not an error.

533
00:37:41,717 --> 00:37:44,512
That's why So-yeon
could recognize your face.

534
00:37:44,595 --> 00:37:46,013
It wasn't because of me.

535
00:37:46,430 --> 00:37:48,349
It's because you're that important to her.

536
00:37:49,809 --> 00:37:50,768
I'm not so sure.

537
00:37:50,851 --> 00:37:52,812
There are too many holes in that logic.

538
00:37:55,940 --> 00:37:58,985
I guess that's how it is.
I've realized that only recently, too.

539
00:37:59,068 --> 00:38:01,779
So I'm capable of doing things
you didn't program me to do?

540
00:38:01,862 --> 00:38:03,155
You taught yourself.

541
00:38:03,239 --> 00:38:06,325
I don't know anything about love,
and I couldn't care less about it.

542
00:38:07,076 --> 00:38:10,162
So I'll give you one final command
as your creator.

543
00:38:11,163 --> 00:38:13,124
Go and make So-yeon happy.

544
00:38:14,625 --> 00:38:16,002
You're capable of that.

545
00:38:16,794 --> 00:38:18,170
-Nan-do.
-Get lost.

546
00:38:36,439 --> 00:38:37,273
Yoo-jin.

547
00:39:02,048 --> 00:39:03,883
Is it supposed to be this painful?

548
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:08,763
I'll do whatever it takes
to persuade the investors.

549
00:39:10,890 --> 00:39:12,516
So you don't need to worry.

550
00:39:30,785 --> 00:39:31,911
Mom.

551
00:39:33,204 --> 00:39:34,288
Mom!

552
00:39:34,622 --> 00:39:37,708
The child who was unloved
and abandoned by his mother

553
00:39:38,209 --> 00:39:40,711
became twisted
because of his emotional scars.

554
00:39:43,714 --> 00:39:47,718
As he grew up,
he didn't let anyone love him.

555
00:39:49,929 --> 00:39:52,681
And that's why, Nan-do,

556
00:39:53,432 --> 00:39:56,894
my heart aches whenever I see Holo,
your creation.

557
00:39:57,603 --> 00:39:59,939
You said
that you were uninterested in others

558
00:40:00,022 --> 00:40:02,900
and that you just wanted
to create the perfect AI,

559
00:40:03,359 --> 00:40:05,152
but didn't you actually program Holo,

560
00:40:05,236 --> 00:40:08,072
who looks just like you,
to be someone you wished you could be?

561
00:40:09,698 --> 00:40:10,658
Because...

562
00:40:11,617 --> 00:40:13,619
you wanted to be loved that badly?

563
00:40:23,421 --> 00:40:24,713
Do you...

564
00:40:25,631 --> 00:40:27,049
still think that...

565
00:40:31,220 --> 00:40:33,389
nobody could ever love you?

566
00:40:39,353 --> 00:40:40,312
Yoo-jin.

567
00:40:40,396 --> 00:40:44,066
Sorry. I was planning to wait.
I heard you were in an important meeting.

568
00:40:44,150 --> 00:40:46,527
No, it's fine. You're welcome anytime.

569
00:40:47,611 --> 00:40:49,029
But what brings you here?

570
00:40:49,113 --> 00:40:51,615
I'll get straight to the point
since it's urgent.

571
00:40:51,699 --> 00:40:52,950
I have a favor to ask.

572
00:40:53,033 --> 00:40:55,703
I'd be happy if you're agreeing to accept
our investment.

573
00:40:55,786 --> 00:41:00,624
No. You know CEO Jang of Bluestone, right?
He's one of our major investors.

574
00:41:00,875 --> 00:41:03,377
-I heard you two are close.
-That's right.

575
00:41:03,461 --> 00:41:06,464
But unlike you and me, my relationship
with him is just business.

576
00:41:06,547 --> 00:41:09,884
I think he's trying to influence
the investors to withdraw their funds.

577
00:41:09,967 --> 00:41:16,307
Can you persuade... No, I'll persuade him.
So, can you arrange a meeting with him?

578
00:41:17,725 --> 00:41:23,230
The situation must be really urgent
if you're asking me this kind of favor.

579
00:41:24,523 --> 00:41:27,026
I'd be happy to help with anything I can.

580
00:41:28,194 --> 00:41:29,195
Thank you.

581
00:41:29,570 --> 00:41:33,407
Thank you so much, Chan-sung.
I'll make sure to repay the favor.

582
00:41:33,908 --> 00:41:35,284
Just keep that promise.

583
00:41:43,250 --> 00:41:44,668
Seems something more important

584
00:41:44,752 --> 00:41:46,921
than your acquisition of our company
came up.

585
00:41:47,338 --> 00:41:50,007
I guess you could say that.
Let's get started.

586
00:42:33,509 --> 00:42:35,970
-I said I'll escort you back.
-Just go to work.

587
00:42:39,390 --> 00:42:41,725
Anyway, how long are you planning
to keep it secret?

588
00:42:41,809 --> 00:42:44,019
-What do you mean?
-You thought you'd fool me?

589
00:42:44,311 --> 00:42:47,690
-Introduce us next time.
-It's not like that, Mom.

590
00:42:47,773 --> 00:42:51,068
Oh, please.
Relationships aren't that complicated.

591
00:42:51,277 --> 00:42:54,572
All you need is a guy
who'll be with you when you're lonely

592
00:42:54,655 --> 00:42:56,532
and be faithful to you.

593
00:42:57,283 --> 00:42:58,784
I'll be going now.

594
00:43:00,244 --> 00:43:01,245
Bye.

595
00:43:12,214 --> 00:43:13,132
Here you go.

596
00:43:13,215 --> 00:43:14,800
Good work.

597
00:43:18,721 --> 00:43:19,805
There we go.

598
00:43:22,474 --> 00:43:24,101
Oh, it's snowing.

599
00:43:25,352 --> 00:43:27,146
-Snowing?
-What?

600
00:43:29,607 --> 00:43:30,816
You're right.

601
00:43:30,899 --> 00:43:32,401
Wow, look! Snow!

602
00:43:36,989 --> 00:43:40,034
Why is it snowing
when it's not even winter anymore?

603
00:43:40,909 --> 00:43:42,494
And the snowflakes are huge, too!

604
00:43:42,578 --> 00:43:43,871
You're right.

605
00:43:45,873 --> 00:43:46,874
Hey, Yoon-seul.

606
00:43:47,458 --> 00:43:49,209
Oh, you're seeing this?

607
00:43:50,002 --> 00:43:52,254
Yes, Mommy can see it too.

608
00:43:52,338 --> 00:43:54,923
Isn't it so pretty?

609
00:43:56,216 --> 00:43:58,177
Yeah, I'll head home early today.

610
00:43:58,969 --> 00:44:01,680
-Okay.
-There was no snow this year

611
00:44:01,764 --> 00:44:03,766
-due to dry weather...
-Mommy loves you too.

612
00:44:03,849 --> 00:44:06,268
...but winter felt bad
about leaving like that

613
00:44:06,352 --> 00:44:07,478
and gave us a late gift.

614
00:44:08,228 --> 00:44:10,314
There were some winters
when it snowed so much

615
00:44:10,397 --> 00:44:14,735
that I'd hope it wouldn't pile up
or that it'd melt soon because of traffic.

616
00:44:14,818 --> 00:44:16,320
But this time, I want to see...

617
00:44:16,403 --> 00:44:19,657
-Cancel my appointments and go to GIO Lab.
-It'd be nice to admire...

618
00:44:19,740 --> 00:44:22,159
-Yes, ma'am.
-...this year's first and last snowfall

619
00:44:22,242 --> 00:44:23,827
with your lover or your family.

620
00:44:25,412 --> 00:44:26,497
It's so pretty.

621
00:44:26,872 --> 00:44:30,125
Yeah.
So this is what real snow looks like.

622
00:44:35,964 --> 00:44:39,093
I think I get why everyone was so excited.

623
00:44:41,845 --> 00:44:45,766
I used to build snowmen
on snowy days with my dad.

624
00:44:46,433 --> 00:44:51,188
But as I got older, I didn't want to feel
left out among all the happy people.

625
00:44:51,647 --> 00:44:52,523
But...

626
00:44:53,565 --> 00:44:56,235
I'm okay now because you're with me.

627
00:44:59,446 --> 00:45:02,241
-Do you want to build a snowman?
-Sure.

628
00:45:03,075 --> 00:45:04,076
Here we go.

629
00:45:10,207 --> 00:45:11,583
It's so cold.

630
00:45:19,883 --> 00:45:20,926
So-yeon.

631
00:45:26,306 --> 00:45:27,224
Wow.

632
00:45:31,687 --> 00:45:33,063
I can do it.

633
00:45:33,564 --> 00:45:34,773
What?

634
00:45:34,857 --> 00:45:37,568
If it's just about being by your side
when you're lonely

635
00:45:38,277 --> 00:45:40,279
and being faithful to you,

636
00:45:40,863 --> 00:45:42,239
I can do it.

637
00:45:45,367 --> 00:45:47,995
Of course,
I don't know much about love yet.

638
00:45:49,830 --> 00:45:52,666
But I... want to...

639
00:45:55,377 --> 00:45:56,712
be in love with you.

640
00:46:05,888 --> 00:46:06,805
Really?

641
00:46:07,973 --> 00:46:10,392
You're not just saying that
to make me feel better?

642
00:46:10,476 --> 00:46:13,061
You know that I'm incapable of lying.

643
00:46:38,378 --> 00:46:40,756
Did you see the snow, Nan-do?

644
00:46:47,471 --> 00:46:48,806
Are you sleeping, Nan-do?

645
00:47:01,401 --> 00:47:02,778
You're burning up.

646
00:47:06,448 --> 00:47:08,534
Here, take some medicine.

647
00:47:08,617 --> 00:47:09,827
Here we go.

648
00:47:21,171 --> 00:47:23,841
How's it going with the investors?

649
00:47:23,924 --> 00:47:25,759
Don't worry. Chan-sung is helping me.

650
00:47:26,176 --> 00:47:29,888
I'll meet with CEO Jang soon, and...
Hang on.

651
00:47:31,515 --> 00:47:32,683
Yes, Chan-sung?

652
00:47:34,685 --> 00:47:35,727
What?

653
00:47:36,770 --> 00:47:39,773
The investors all want to sell
their shares to Magic Mirror.

654
00:47:41,817 --> 00:47:44,236
Can you give me more details?
What did you just say?

655
00:47:44,319 --> 00:47:48,240
I tried to convince them,
but they've already made up their minds.

656
00:47:48,740 --> 00:47:52,119
They thought it was the only thing
that could rehabilitate GIO Lab.

657
00:47:52,202 --> 00:47:56,832
I spoke up against it, but...
our president wouldn't change his mind.

658
00:47:57,749 --> 00:47:58,709
I'm sorry.

659
00:47:59,376 --> 00:48:03,338
The investors will be visiting you
tomorrow. I’ll be there as well.

660
00:48:03,839 --> 00:48:04,840
See you tomorrow.

661
00:48:10,721 --> 00:48:13,265
The police said
the interrogation's still underway.

662
00:48:14,683 --> 00:48:17,436
He should be talking to them by now, then.

663
00:48:18,645 --> 00:48:21,815
If Mr. Jeong can sway the police
according to our plan,

664
00:48:22,983 --> 00:48:26,028
even that ghost won't be able to slip out
of this one.

665
00:48:26,111 --> 00:48:27,237
Yes, I understand.

666
00:48:28,906 --> 00:48:31,700
We don't care who you are.

667
00:48:33,493 --> 00:48:35,329
Just tell us...

668
00:48:36,455 --> 00:48:38,707
about the guy you were chasing after.

669
00:48:40,250 --> 00:48:43,795
We won't let you take a single step
out of here if you don't.

670
00:48:49,593 --> 00:48:50,594
Twelve years ago,

671
00:48:51,511 --> 00:48:53,055
a hacker from New Zealand

672
00:48:53,138 --> 00:48:56,808
got his hands on Korean police records,
forensics data, social registries,

673
00:48:56,892 --> 00:48:58,268
everything.

674
00:49:00,938 --> 00:49:01,939
So?

675
00:49:02,022 --> 00:49:05,651
The police tracked him down,
and he was just a 17-year-old kid.

676
00:49:06,109 --> 00:49:07,486
And he was of Korean descent.

677
00:49:07,611 --> 00:49:11,114
They said he jumped off a cliff
and committed suicide before the arrest.

678
00:49:11,198 --> 00:49:14,493
But he's actually alive,
and this is that guy?

679
00:49:21,291 --> 00:49:22,876
The investors are here.

680
00:49:23,001 --> 00:49:26,672
I'll take care of this mess,
so don't worry and just stay here.

681
00:49:27,714 --> 00:49:29,341
Don't you dare leave this room.

682
00:50:06,211 --> 00:50:07,129
POLICE

683
00:50:10,632 --> 00:50:11,717
Follow me.

684
00:50:11,800 --> 00:50:13,010
POLICE

685
00:51:06,438 --> 00:51:07,814
-You can't come in here.
-Wait.

686
00:51:07,898 --> 00:51:09,775
-How dare you!
-You can't come in here.

687
00:51:09,858 --> 00:51:12,152
-Get out of our way.
-You can't just walk in here.

688
00:51:21,161 --> 00:51:22,329
Hey!

689
00:51:22,412 --> 00:51:23,288
Nan-do!

690
00:53:24,993 --> 00:53:26,912
