1
00:00:43,668 --> 00:00:47,380
Do you really not remember anything?

2
00:00:47,464 --> 00:00:49,340
I'm So-yeon. Han So-yeon.

3
00:00:49,424 --> 00:00:50,592
Han So-yeon?

4
00:00:56,848 --> 00:00:57,682
I'm sorry.

5
00:00:57,766 --> 00:00:59,267
You have
a beautiful name, though.

6
00:01:03,855 --> 00:01:07,525
It's a relief that we were able
to retrieve the data this fast,

7
00:01:07,609 --> 00:01:09,986
but only his recognition algorithm
has been restored.

8
00:01:10,070 --> 00:01:11,988
His memories have yet to be synchronized.

9
00:01:12,072 --> 00:01:14,991
-What if we forcefully connect the data?
-I tried. It won't work.

10
00:01:15,617 --> 00:01:18,078
Holo might be able to connect it
by himself.

11
00:01:18,161 --> 00:01:19,412
"By himself"?

12
00:01:19,496 --> 00:01:21,706
It depends on
whether Holo's willing to do so.

13
00:01:22,290 --> 00:01:24,292
Why won't you come out of there?

14
00:01:25,293 --> 00:01:26,127
I don't know

15
00:01:26,211 --> 00:01:27,504
how to get out of here.

16
00:01:28,630 --> 00:01:30,465
I don't even know why I'm in here.

17
00:01:34,469 --> 00:01:36,971
How can I help you bring back your memory?

18
00:01:37,055 --> 00:01:37,889
Is that...

19
00:01:39,224 --> 00:01:40,725
really necessary?

20
00:01:40,809 --> 00:01:43,061
Of course. You need to be yourself again.

21
00:01:43,144 --> 00:01:46,022
Which version of me are you talking about?

22
00:01:49,776 --> 00:01:51,236
The version...

23
00:01:52,362 --> 00:01:54,489
that I loved and that loved me back.

24
00:01:55,865 --> 00:01:56,699
I...

25
00:01:57,492 --> 00:01:58,827
was in love...

26
00:02:01,121 --> 00:02:02,038
with you?

27
00:02:03,915 --> 00:02:04,874
Yes.

28
00:02:44,164 --> 00:02:47,208
I did get the feeling
that someone was waiting for me.

29
00:02:48,001 --> 00:02:49,377
It must have been you.

30
00:02:51,546 --> 00:02:54,090
If I regain my memory,

31
00:02:54,799 --> 00:02:56,509
will I be able...

32
00:02:57,677 --> 00:02:58,803
to love again?

33
00:02:59,971 --> 00:03:01,222
You will.

34
00:03:02,849 --> 00:03:04,100
I'm sure of it.

35
00:03:09,689 --> 00:03:11,983
So we need to find a way
for Holo to want this.

36
00:03:12,066 --> 00:03:13,568
Yes, that's what we need first.

37
00:03:13,651 --> 00:03:16,321
Then we have to find a cue
that can activate his memories.

38
00:03:16,404 --> 00:03:18,615
A what?
Can't you put it in layman's terms?

39
00:03:18,698 --> 00:03:20,742
Holo is currently locked up in a room.

40
00:03:20,825 --> 00:03:22,827
He needs a key to get out,

41
00:03:22,911 --> 00:03:26,581
but he doesn't know where he put it
or what it even looks like.

42
00:03:27,123 --> 00:03:29,292
How can he find something
he doesn't recognize?

43
00:03:29,751 --> 00:03:31,002
I'll find it for him.

44
00:03:32,337 --> 00:03:33,671
I want to help.

45
00:03:34,172 --> 00:03:35,006
I'm sorry,

46
00:03:35,089 --> 00:03:37,300
but there's nothing you can do for him.

47
00:03:37,634 --> 00:03:40,386
Holo... wants his memories back.

48
00:03:42,931 --> 00:03:46,476
What? Wait, Holo actually said that?

49
00:03:47,268 --> 00:03:48,561
That's impossible.

50
00:03:48,645 --> 00:03:51,397
I've been trying
the conversation protocol for hours,

51
00:03:51,481 --> 00:03:52,982
but he never responded.

52
00:03:53,066 --> 00:03:56,486
I might not be the one here
who knows Holo the best.

53
00:03:59,072 --> 00:04:01,074
You have to stay here
for security reasons.

54
00:04:01,157 --> 00:04:03,701
-Will you be okay with that?
-I won't leave Holo,

55
00:04:03,785 --> 00:04:05,370
considering the state he's in.

56
00:04:05,453 --> 00:04:07,205
I'll do whatever I can.

57
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:22,470
BAEK CHAN-SUNG

58
00:04:23,263 --> 00:04:25,139
Thank you for letting me know.

59
00:04:25,223 --> 00:04:26,683
But how did you know...

60
00:04:31,396 --> 00:04:33,731
I just realized
what a stupid question that was.

61
00:04:34,857 --> 00:04:37,777
-Yoo-jin--
-Why didn't you just keep deceiving me?

62
00:04:39,070 --> 00:04:41,155
-I'm sorry.
-There's no need to be,

63
00:04:41,614 --> 00:04:44,033
since we're enemies now, not friends.

64
00:05:01,050 --> 00:05:02,969
The ones after HoloGlass

65
00:05:03,678 --> 00:05:05,221
were from Magic Mirror?

66
00:05:08,725 --> 00:05:10,518
Those bastards.

67
00:05:15,690 --> 00:05:16,774
Are you all right?

68
00:05:18,609 --> 00:05:19,736
No, I'm not.

69
00:05:19,819 --> 00:05:22,030
To be honest,
I want to rip them to pieces.

70
00:05:22,113 --> 00:05:24,073
Press charges
for a civil and criminal suit.

71
00:05:24,157 --> 00:05:25,366
Are you sure?

72
00:05:25,450 --> 00:05:27,493
What if the police find out about Holo?

73
00:05:27,577 --> 00:05:29,245
The blackout? The hacking?

74
00:05:29,329 --> 00:05:30,621
There's no evidence.

75
00:05:30,997 --> 00:05:33,624
Even if there were,

76
00:05:33,750 --> 00:05:37,128
disclosing it will only prove
that they were after Holo.

77
00:05:38,463 --> 00:05:41,215
Besides, they wouldn't want to ruin
Holo's commercial value.

78
00:05:42,383 --> 00:05:43,593
Are you okay with this?

79
00:05:44,802 --> 00:05:46,471
What about Han So-yeon?

80
00:05:48,306 --> 00:05:50,099
She probably hates my guts right now.

81
00:05:50,850 --> 00:05:52,268
Make sure she feels at home.

82
00:06:41,818 --> 00:06:43,694
-Did you get a good night's sleep?
-I did.

83
00:07:01,462 --> 00:07:02,630
The bathroom.

84
00:07:30,783 --> 00:07:31,617
"Boss"?

85
00:07:32,743 --> 00:07:35,246
That's your position in the company,
not your name.

86
00:07:35,872 --> 00:07:38,207
-Is there a reason you won't tell me--
-Enough.

87
00:07:39,167 --> 00:07:40,585
Name prime numbers over 1,000.

88
00:07:40,668 --> 00:07:46,716
1,009, 1,013, 1,019, 1,021, 1,031, 1,033--

89
00:07:46,799 --> 00:07:47,633
That's enough.

90
00:07:49,927 --> 00:07:54,974
Your calculation abilities are up to par.
Next, I'll test your morality.

91
00:07:55,975 --> 00:07:58,436
There's a man who is in love with a woman.

92
00:07:59,270 --> 00:08:00,688
However, that woman...

93
00:08:01,814 --> 00:08:03,774
is in love with his twin brother.

94
00:08:06,027 --> 00:08:09,572
But his twin brother
went into a vegetative state.

95
00:08:10,323 --> 00:08:13,659
So the man pretended to be
his twin brother and dated the woman,

96
00:08:13,743 --> 00:08:14,952
and he was happy.

97
00:08:15,036 --> 00:08:16,787
However, the woman found out.

98
00:08:17,663 --> 00:08:19,290
How should the man act from now on?

99
00:08:19,373 --> 00:08:21,834
What does the woman think of the man?

100
00:08:23,753 --> 00:08:25,254
She probably hates him a lot.

101
00:08:25,338 --> 00:08:27,256
I doubt she'll ever forgive him.

102
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:31,177
It's probably wise...

103
00:08:31,511 --> 00:08:33,888
-for the man to stop, right?
-Stop what?

104
00:08:33,971 --> 00:08:35,097
Loving her.

105
00:08:35,598 --> 00:08:36,724
Love...

106
00:08:38,142 --> 00:08:41,562
is the emotion
of deeply caring for someone.

107
00:08:41,646 --> 00:08:45,149
Must the other person feel
the same way for love to exist?

108
00:08:49,237 --> 00:08:50,530
Let's take a break.

109
00:09:27,024 --> 00:09:29,110
So that's when you said...

110
00:09:29,860 --> 00:09:32,029
that you'll always be by my side.

111
00:09:34,365 --> 00:09:37,743
Actually, it wasn't long ago,
even though It feels like a lifetime.

112
00:09:37,827 --> 00:09:39,579
But it's a promise I can't keep.

113
00:09:39,662 --> 00:09:40,997
Are you saying I lied?

114
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:42,331
A lie?

115
00:09:42,415 --> 00:09:44,709
That reminds me.
You also asked me this too.

116
00:09:44,792 --> 00:09:47,837
You asked me whether it's a lie
when people say that

117
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:49,422
they'll love one another forever.

118
00:09:49,505 --> 00:09:50,339
Is it not?

119
00:09:50,423 --> 00:09:51,966
So that's when I said

120
00:09:52,049 --> 00:09:54,760
that they mean it,
even though it might not be the truth.

121
00:09:54,844 --> 00:09:56,053
"They mean it"?

122
00:09:56,137 --> 00:09:59,515
That's exactly the look you had
on your face back then.

123
00:10:00,391 --> 00:10:02,184
You can identify my face?

124
00:10:02,268 --> 00:10:04,437
I thought
you suffered from face blindness.

125
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:05,730
Right...

126
00:10:06,564 --> 00:10:07,773
Well...

127
00:10:08,733 --> 00:10:11,736
I got into a big accident recently,

128
00:10:12,445 --> 00:10:14,822
but... I was saved.

129
00:10:14,905 --> 00:10:15,823
By me?

130
00:10:17,074 --> 00:10:19,201
But that's not physically possible.

131
00:10:20,369 --> 00:10:21,329
Well...

132
00:10:21,412 --> 00:10:23,080
Right, the boss.

133
00:10:23,789 --> 00:10:26,417
He was the person who saved you.

134
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:28,044
Then it makes sense.

135
00:10:28,127 --> 00:10:31,922
You said your face blindness
was due to psychological factors, so--

136
00:10:32,006 --> 00:10:33,132
No, that's not it.

137
00:10:33,215 --> 00:10:36,719
It's your face
that I've come to recognize, not his.

138
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:40,514
I'm sorry,

139
00:10:41,015 --> 00:10:42,475
but I don't understand.

140
00:10:45,936 --> 00:10:47,063
It's...

141
00:10:48,314 --> 00:10:49,815
it's just how it is.

142
00:10:52,109 --> 00:10:53,152
It just is.

143
00:10:58,574 --> 00:11:00,076
Is something wrong?

144
00:11:07,041 --> 00:11:08,209
So-yeon?

145
00:11:08,918 --> 00:11:09,794
Mom.

146
00:11:12,505 --> 00:11:13,673
I don't know

147
00:11:14,131 --> 00:11:16,342
what I've been doing all this time.

148
00:11:16,425 --> 00:11:19,261
-Did you have an argument?
-No.

149
00:11:22,056 --> 00:11:24,392
Having an argument
would have been much better.

150
00:11:28,354 --> 00:11:30,564
Why? Did he say something?

151
00:11:31,482 --> 00:11:35,319
From what I saw last time,
he seemed quite serious about you.

152
00:11:37,238 --> 00:11:39,907
-I'm not talking about him.
-Well, whoever it is,

153
00:11:40,449 --> 00:11:43,452
just follow your heart, okay?

154
00:11:44,036 --> 00:11:45,538
That's all you need to remember.

155
00:12:08,978 --> 00:12:10,312
Don't worry.

156
00:12:10,396 --> 00:12:12,231
He's not back yet.

157
00:12:15,067 --> 00:12:18,404
He'll probably come back way past midnight
in order to avoid you.

158
00:12:20,990 --> 00:12:23,325
I see you're still up.

159
00:12:26,036 --> 00:12:28,038
I have too many things on my mind.

160
00:12:28,122 --> 00:12:30,374
-Would you like a drink?
-No, I'm good.

161
00:12:31,125 --> 00:12:34,378
We probably feel the same way right now.

162
00:12:35,755 --> 00:12:39,550
The person I opened up to turned out
to be someone completely different,

163
00:12:39,633 --> 00:12:41,302
so I'm angry and confused.

164
00:12:42,052 --> 00:12:44,930
One part of me wants to know why,

165
00:12:45,681 --> 00:12:49,101
but the other part of me
is so outraged by the deception

166
00:12:49,727 --> 00:12:51,312
that I don't want to know.

167
00:12:52,897 --> 00:12:54,815
There's something
you should know, though.

168
00:12:54,899 --> 00:12:57,401
He did it for a reason.

169
00:12:58,944 --> 00:13:01,238
-I get what you're saying--
-It's his first time.

170
00:13:02,281 --> 00:13:05,701
It's his first time liking someone
who isn't Holo.

171
00:13:08,287 --> 00:13:10,623
Sorry,
but I don't want to hear about it anymore.

172
00:13:12,249 --> 00:13:14,210
I've had it with the both of you.

173
00:13:14,293 --> 00:13:16,837
We'll never fix Holo at this rate.

174
00:13:16,921 --> 00:13:19,715
I hear there's no clear progress,
and I'm not surprised.

175
00:13:19,799 --> 00:13:22,343
The two key personnel
are refusing to work together.

176
00:13:23,469 --> 00:13:25,846
You think you know Holo the best, right?

177
00:13:30,601 --> 00:13:34,355
There's someone who has spent
much more time with Holo than you have.

178
00:13:34,939 --> 00:13:36,857
He spent most of his time here,

179
00:13:37,107 --> 00:13:38,317
creating Holo

180
00:13:38,734 --> 00:13:40,402
in solitude.

181
00:13:51,622 --> 00:13:53,958
You probably don't want to know,

182
00:13:54,041 --> 00:13:57,419
but why do you think Nan-do created Holo?

183
00:13:58,921 --> 00:14:00,881
A holographic AI that looks like him

184
00:14:00,965 --> 00:14:04,009
but is the opposite of him
in terms of his cold personality.

185
00:14:06,846 --> 00:14:09,181
My guess is that...

186
00:14:09,974 --> 00:14:12,476
it was his way of coping

187
00:14:13,894 --> 00:14:15,312
with himself.

188
00:14:26,365 --> 00:14:28,200
How's the memory recovery coming along?

189
00:14:30,661 --> 00:14:32,746
There hasn't been much progress.

190
00:14:32,830 --> 00:14:35,332
Is the conversation protocol not enough?

191
00:14:46,385 --> 00:14:47,636
Hello, Miss Han.

192
00:14:48,429 --> 00:14:49,346
Hello.

193
00:14:56,562 --> 00:14:59,523
Do you know how to use this machine?
I'd like a latte.

194
00:14:59,607 --> 00:15:05,404
I'm good with most machines in this world,
but coffee has never been my thing.

195
00:15:05,487 --> 00:15:07,323
What would you like?

196
00:15:08,866 --> 00:15:11,160
Jin-seok, you enjoy your latte
with less foam.

197
00:15:11,243 --> 00:15:13,579
In New Zealand, it's called flat white.

198
00:15:13,662 --> 00:15:16,874
There's a button here with "flat white"
written on it, so press it.

199
00:15:16,957 --> 00:15:18,709
The touchscreen makes it easier.

200
00:15:27,176 --> 00:15:29,386
It's hot, so be careful, all right?

201
00:15:32,264 --> 00:15:34,975
The key is to have a thin
and flat layer of foam.

202
00:15:37,353 --> 00:15:39,355
But I don't drink coffee...

203
00:15:39,897 --> 00:15:40,814
Is that so?

204
00:15:41,941 --> 00:15:43,359
Then I'll leave it here.

205
00:15:43,567 --> 00:15:45,444
Someone can drink it or throw it away.

206
00:15:52,117 --> 00:15:53,202
What was that?

207
00:15:53,285 --> 00:15:55,496
I forgot what kind of person
I actually am,

208
00:15:55,579 --> 00:15:57,039
but this is the real me.

209
00:15:57,122 --> 00:15:59,833
I do whatever I want
whether people hate me or not.

210
00:16:00,668 --> 00:16:01,919
So you do the same.

211
00:16:02,378 --> 00:16:03,879
Loathe me or ignore me.

212
00:16:04,338 --> 00:16:05,756
I'm used to it anyway.

213
00:16:07,299 --> 00:16:09,551
Then I'll keep ignoring you

214
00:16:09,635 --> 00:16:11,679
and loathe you from time to time.

215
00:16:15,641 --> 00:16:17,893
What on earth are you two doing?

216
00:16:18,310 --> 00:16:21,438
We should be combining our efforts.
Some people are working all night.

217
00:16:21,522 --> 00:16:24,191
Also, this coffee isn't even mine!

218
00:16:25,484 --> 00:16:26,485
I'm sorry.

219
00:16:26,568 --> 00:16:29,613
If you two are going to keep on bickering,
do it outside.

220
00:16:29,697 --> 00:16:32,116
-Bite each other's heads off out there.
-Hey.

221
00:16:32,408 --> 00:16:35,285
You... Since when do you yell at me? Hey!

222
00:16:43,210 --> 00:16:45,421
Jin-seok's right. Let's take this outside.

223
00:16:45,504 --> 00:16:46,588
Sorry?

224
00:16:46,672 --> 00:16:48,298
We can't retrieve Holo's memories.

225
00:16:48,382 --> 00:16:49,633
Let's use the glasses

226
00:16:49,717 --> 00:16:51,885
to show him things
he might be able to remember.

227
00:16:52,511 --> 00:16:53,637
-The two of us?
-Why?

228
00:16:53,721 --> 00:16:56,348
Do you feel uncomfortable
because I said I like you?

229
00:16:56,473 --> 00:16:59,643
I'll manage my own feelings,
so you don't have to worry.

230
00:17:01,937 --> 00:17:03,856
-If not, I'll go by myself--
-No.

231
00:17:04,898 --> 00:17:06,025
I'll go.

232
00:17:08,861 --> 00:17:11,780
Come down when you're ready.
I'll pull up the car.

233
00:17:13,574 --> 00:17:14,658
Jeez.

234
00:17:29,757 --> 00:17:30,632
Let's go.

235
00:17:33,886 --> 00:17:37,139
And these documents
are additional evidence

236
00:17:37,222 --> 00:17:39,433
which prove that Magic Mirror
tried to steal

237
00:17:39,516 --> 00:17:43,771
the prototype from my client's company
after failing to hack its servers.

238
00:17:44,813 --> 00:17:47,649
Gosh, what's with the thick wad of paper?

239
00:17:48,108 --> 00:17:49,693
It's been a while, Miss Ko.

240
00:17:50,027 --> 00:17:51,487
Hello, Detective Nam.

241
00:17:51,779 --> 00:17:55,616
I'll probably be handling this case.

242
00:17:55,699 --> 00:17:57,034
Are you okay with that?

243
00:17:57,242 --> 00:17:59,286
I'm hoping for an impartial investigation.

244
00:17:59,369 --> 00:18:03,916
It seems connected
to a case I've been looking into,

245
00:18:03,999 --> 00:18:05,501
so I intend to dig deep.

246
00:18:05,584 --> 00:18:08,962
If you're implying that
this investigation could hurt my client,

247
00:18:09,046 --> 00:18:12,257
-we'll ask for another detective.
-No, it's all right.

248
00:18:12,466 --> 00:18:15,636
He's a trustworthy man,
so I'm sure he'll stick to the facts.

249
00:18:16,303 --> 00:18:17,346
Thank you.

250
00:18:22,142 --> 00:18:23,560
Take care.

251
00:18:27,439 --> 00:18:29,108
BILL OF INDICTMENT

252
00:18:29,191 --> 00:18:31,485
ACCUSANT: KO YOO-JIN
ACCUSED: MAGIC MIRROR CORPORATION

253
00:18:42,538 --> 00:18:43,664
Let me.

254
00:18:55,759 --> 00:18:57,511
Don't you two have memories up here?

255
00:19:00,931 --> 00:19:04,768
-Is it transmitting clearly?
-Yes, I can see everything clearly.

256
00:19:05,060 --> 00:19:07,521
It feels like
I haven't been here in a while.

257
00:19:07,771 --> 00:19:08,856
Do you remember, Holo?

258
00:19:09,439 --> 00:19:11,525
You threw me a rooftop party here

259
00:19:11,608 --> 00:19:13,652
and showed me an aurora.

260
00:19:14,236 --> 00:19:15,779
It was really nice.

261
00:19:18,282 --> 00:19:19,283
I don't remember.

262
00:19:24,830 --> 00:19:25,914
Try to remember.

263
00:19:28,584 --> 00:19:31,753
Come on. I was sitting right here,

264
00:19:31,837 --> 00:19:33,505
drinking beer.

265
00:19:33,589 --> 00:19:34,798
Then...

266
00:19:43,974 --> 00:19:45,392
It was you, wasn't it?

267
00:19:46,393 --> 00:19:48,228
The stalker from that day...

268
00:19:50,063 --> 00:19:51,106
"Stalker"?

269
00:19:51,565 --> 00:19:54,318
I was only here to retrieve Holo from you.

270
00:19:54,401 --> 00:19:58,030
Besides, I wasn't the one who kissed you.
You had too much to drink and...

271
00:19:59,990 --> 00:20:01,825
Still, it was just an accident.

272
00:20:01,909 --> 00:20:04,703
I didn't even know you suffered
from face blindness back then.

273
00:20:04,786 --> 00:20:08,123
I thought you'd know I was Holo's creator
once you saw my face.

274
00:20:08,207 --> 00:20:09,750
Besides, didn't I explain?

275
00:20:09,833 --> 00:20:12,753
You can tell us apart
through certain features.

276
00:20:12,836 --> 00:20:15,756
You moved in next door
knowing I had face blindness.

277
00:20:15,839 --> 00:20:17,841
You knew I wouldn't recognize you.

278
00:20:18,342 --> 00:20:19,509
That's true, but--

279
00:20:19,593 --> 00:20:21,887
How can someone like you
have created Holo?

280
00:20:26,683 --> 00:20:27,976
Boss, why did you do that?

281
00:20:28,060 --> 00:20:29,228
Do you hate Miss Han?

282
00:20:29,311 --> 00:20:31,104
I don't want to listen to you.

283
00:20:32,564 --> 00:20:33,899
Damn.

284
00:20:39,738 --> 00:20:42,950
Yoo-ram, are you kidding me?
You could've at least tidied up.

285
00:20:43,742 --> 00:20:46,370
I doubt he'll remember anything
in this state.

286
00:20:47,371 --> 00:20:48,956
Once we tidy up the place--

287
00:20:50,082 --> 00:20:51,124
Gosh.

288
00:20:53,418 --> 00:20:54,544
Gosh.

289
00:21:27,577 --> 00:21:31,581
Holo, I first thought you were a ghost.

290
00:21:31,665 --> 00:21:32,708
A "ghost"?

291
00:21:32,791 --> 00:21:34,835
I even performed the rites to appease you.

292
00:21:40,132 --> 00:21:41,216
Just a second.

293
00:21:47,014 --> 00:21:47,889
Okay.

294
00:21:58,358 --> 00:22:00,902
I can't believe I even bought this too.

295
00:22:05,157 --> 00:22:06,616
Holo, look at this.

296
00:22:22,716 --> 00:22:24,801
Let's head to where you two first met.

297
00:22:36,355 --> 00:22:38,482
I'm sorry for not remembering anything.

298
00:22:39,274 --> 00:22:40,650
How about this, then?

299
00:22:42,819 --> 00:22:44,946
On the day that I was really upset,

300
00:22:45,364 --> 00:22:47,366
I was sitting there all by myself.

301
00:22:49,242 --> 00:22:50,494
And you were standing here.

302
00:22:51,161 --> 00:22:52,704
What you said to me back then

303
00:22:52,788 --> 00:22:55,415
gave me great comfort.

304
00:22:55,499 --> 00:22:56,541
What did I say?

305
00:22:56,625 --> 00:22:57,626
Well...

306
00:23:08,387 --> 00:23:09,513
My gosh.

307
00:23:09,721 --> 00:23:11,056
I guess...

308
00:23:11,681 --> 00:23:15,685
this house befits
the president of a global company.

309
00:23:17,396 --> 00:23:19,856
My son already told me a lot about you.

310
00:23:19,940 --> 00:23:22,067
Then I'll cut right to the chase.

311
00:23:23,318 --> 00:23:25,570
-I'm here to make a deal.
-"A deal"?

312
00:23:25,654 --> 00:23:29,658
The suspect I'm after isn't a person,
but an AI.

313
00:23:35,205 --> 00:23:39,584
Did an AI commit a crime
and flee from the police or something?

314
00:23:40,419 --> 00:23:42,796
Have you come from the future?

315
00:23:42,879 --> 00:23:46,425
I'm glad you found my words amusing.

316
00:23:46,883 --> 00:23:51,138
But GIO Lab, the company
that sued Magic Mirror, specializes in AI.

317
00:23:51,221 --> 00:23:55,434
I've released an official statement
regarding that matter--

318
00:23:55,517 --> 00:23:58,728
I can cover everything up for you
if you cooperate.

319
00:24:00,147 --> 00:24:02,774
You know that sounds misleading, right?

320
00:24:02,858 --> 00:24:05,110
I prefer a thorough investigation

321
00:24:05,527 --> 00:24:08,447
that will prove Magic Mirror's innocence.

322
00:24:09,990 --> 00:24:10,824
I understand.

323
00:24:12,951 --> 00:24:13,785
By the way,

324
00:24:14,703 --> 00:24:19,791
you seem to have a problem with your leg.
May I ask how that happened?

325
00:24:25,130 --> 00:24:29,468
You're Detective Nam Gi-ho?
You seem to have a lot of questions.

326
00:24:30,635 --> 00:24:32,012
It comes with the job.

327
00:24:32,220 --> 00:24:35,307
I apologize if I crossed the line.
Please forgive me.

328
00:24:53,867 --> 00:24:55,827
You mean I met Holo
for the first time here,

329
00:24:55,911 --> 00:24:56,953
not at the coffee shop?

330
00:24:57,287 --> 00:24:59,456
The coffee shop
is where you first saw Holo.

331
00:24:59,539 --> 00:25:02,083
Meanwhile, this is where Holo saw you
for the first time.

332
00:25:06,505 --> 00:25:08,673
The delivery mix-up?
I was walking by when--

333
00:25:08,757 --> 00:25:12,093
Holo chose you
and sneaked the glasses into your purse.

334
00:25:12,761 --> 00:25:15,597
Why did I choose Miss Han, though?

335
00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:17,265
I'm still not sure about that.

336
00:25:17,349 --> 00:25:20,060
You behaved strangely.
Like you fell for her at first sight.

337
00:25:21,770 --> 00:25:22,896
That's odd.

338
00:25:22,979 --> 00:25:26,525
Maybe I thought she'd give back
the glasses later on.

339
00:25:26,608 --> 00:25:27,567
What I said is true.

340
00:25:27,651 --> 00:25:29,236
-Hand over the glasses.
-Hey.

341
00:25:29,778 --> 00:25:30,946
Why?

342
00:25:31,029 --> 00:25:33,698
Holo might remember something
if we reenact the scene.

343
00:25:33,865 --> 00:25:36,493
I'll watch you
from where Yoo-jin was that day,

344
00:25:36,993 --> 00:25:38,578
so walk over in this direction.

345
00:25:56,888 --> 00:25:58,515
Does this jog your memory?

346
00:25:59,849 --> 00:26:01,393
No, I still have nothing.

347
00:26:03,311 --> 00:26:05,105
Where exactly was I, though?

348
00:27:25,018 --> 00:27:26,895
-Do I move closer?
-I remember now.

349
00:27:28,605 --> 00:27:30,607
-What do you mean?
-This isn't...

350
00:27:31,149 --> 00:27:32,692
where I first met Miss Han.

351
00:27:33,610 --> 00:27:34,819
What do you mean?

352
00:27:35,278 --> 00:27:36,655
I first saw you

353
00:27:37,030 --> 00:27:39,616
a long time ago in a quiet neighborhood
with small houses.

354
00:27:40,867 --> 00:27:42,869
Data from back then should be long gone.

355
00:27:42,952 --> 00:27:44,496
What is Holo talking about?

356
00:27:47,040 --> 00:27:50,001
You know something, right?
"From back then?"

357
00:27:50,085 --> 00:27:53,296
It means that I met Holo before all this
and that you know about it.

358
00:27:53,380 --> 00:27:55,131
Are you hiding something again?

359
00:27:55,215 --> 00:27:57,842
This is why
you're not telling me your name, isn't it?

360
00:28:01,846 --> 00:28:05,016
You know what? I'll be better off
looking into this myself.

361
00:28:06,184 --> 00:28:08,103
Do you remember the name Nan-do?

362
00:28:10,355 --> 00:28:11,398
Seo Nan-do.

363
00:28:13,066 --> 00:28:14,359
It was my childhood name.

364
00:28:20,949 --> 00:28:23,743
-On a lonely day
-On a lonely day

365
00:28:24,244 --> 00:28:27,580
-On a day we long for a friend
-On a day we long for a friend

366
00:28:27,664 --> 00:28:30,375
-We make one
-We make one

367
00:28:30,458 --> 00:28:34,379
-That is cute and fascinating
-That is cute and fascinating

368
00:28:34,462 --> 00:28:36,214
-Let's make a friend
-Let's make a friend

369
00:28:36,297 --> 00:28:39,259
-Ppyororong, My Friend
-Ppyororong, My Friend

370
00:28:39,342 --> 00:28:41,136
Hello, friends!

371
00:28:41,219 --> 00:28:43,555
We're making an animal today.

372
00:28:43,638 --> 00:28:46,057
-You're here!
-It's a cute little puppy on a stick.

373
00:28:46,141 --> 00:28:49,978
Fold the paper into a crooked triangle
and flip it over.

374
00:28:50,061 --> 00:28:53,857
Fold the ends slightly like this

375
00:28:53,940 --> 00:28:56,526
and twist it to face the front.

376
00:28:56,609 --> 00:28:59,279
Look. What an interesting shape!

377
00:28:59,362 --> 00:29:01,614
-Press and fold the sides.
-I heard Nan-do's here.

378
00:29:02,741 --> 00:29:05,952
Goodness. Are you that happy to see me?

379
00:29:06,453 --> 00:29:08,705
I'm sorry for being busy all the time.

380
00:29:10,123 --> 00:29:11,166
So where's Hello?

381
00:29:11,249 --> 00:29:13,543
Let's see what kind of fun
you had all day.

382
00:29:15,086 --> 00:29:16,755
-Hello.
-Hi.

383
00:29:17,589 --> 00:29:18,631
So where's your mom?

384
00:29:18,715 --> 00:29:20,091
She went to the restaurant.

385
00:29:20,175 --> 00:29:21,092
I see.

386
00:29:21,509 --> 00:29:23,595
I should really thank her
in person someday.

387
00:29:24,345 --> 00:29:27,474
Anyway, thank you so much
for keeping Nan-do company.

388
00:29:37,567 --> 00:29:42,030
Then... why did you say you're an orphan?

389
00:29:42,113 --> 00:29:44,407
-I remember you having a mom--
-She died.

390
00:29:49,204 --> 00:29:52,373
What is it?
Do you now think you should forgive me

391
00:29:52,457 --> 00:29:56,044
because we used to know each other,
and I became an orphan since then?

392
00:30:04,219 --> 00:30:05,970
He's unbelievable.

393
00:30:06,638 --> 00:30:07,931
I don't understand.

394
00:30:08,014 --> 00:30:10,266
He moved in next door
and hid his identity,

395
00:30:10,350 --> 00:30:12,185
pretended to be me in front of you,

396
00:30:12,268 --> 00:30:15,396
and hid the fact
that you two knew each other as kids.

397
00:30:17,482 --> 00:30:18,566
Well...

398
00:30:21,110 --> 00:30:24,739
I think he wanted to hide it,
not deceive me.

399
00:30:24,823 --> 00:30:25,949
Hide what?

400
00:30:26,032 --> 00:30:29,202
He didn't want me knowing his weakness.

401
00:30:29,577 --> 00:30:32,038
That's probably why he wanted
to hide his true self.

402
00:30:34,332 --> 00:30:35,500
I...

403
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,461
was also like that with someone too.

404
00:30:39,629 --> 00:30:41,130
That's how I know.

405
00:30:41,714 --> 00:30:43,883
Why would anyone choose to act that way?

406
00:30:48,429 --> 00:30:49,597
Just because.

407
00:30:52,183 --> 00:30:54,018
So you two knew each other

408
00:30:54,102 --> 00:30:55,103
when you were young.

409
00:30:55,186 --> 00:30:56,896
"Hello," was it?

410
00:30:57,188 --> 00:31:00,024
-Did such a thing exist?
-It's the early version of Holo.

411
00:31:00,692 --> 00:31:02,986
So your late mother made it for you?

412
00:31:03,069 --> 00:31:04,904
I deleted my memories,

413
00:31:05,154 --> 00:31:10,285
as well as all the data from Holo's files.
I can't believe they were still there.

414
00:31:10,368 --> 00:31:14,080
So Holo has gone back to being Hello.

415
00:31:14,664 --> 00:31:17,000
That's why he can't leave the screen.

416
00:31:17,584 --> 00:31:19,502
Just like when he was kept
inside a device.

417
00:31:19,586 --> 00:31:21,421
Then...

418
00:31:22,839 --> 00:31:25,675
Something related to Hello
could be the cue we're looking for.

419
00:31:25,758 --> 00:31:27,302
That's most likely for now.

420
00:31:28,219 --> 00:31:30,263
Why don't you go to your old neighborhood?

421
00:31:30,346 --> 00:31:33,600
It doesn't look the same
after the area was redeveloped.

422
00:31:34,851 --> 00:31:38,271
-Then that only leaves one place.
-That place...

423
00:31:41,482 --> 00:31:43,192
I'd rather go alone there.

424
00:31:44,861 --> 00:31:46,654
Red light, green light.

425
00:31:47,405 --> 00:31:49,407
Red light, green light.

426
00:31:50,033 --> 00:31:50,909
Red light...

427
00:31:52,994 --> 00:31:54,370
I saw you moving!

428
00:31:55,121 --> 00:31:56,372
At the last moment...

429
00:31:58,499 --> 00:32:00,460
He moved at the last moment.

430
00:32:02,378 --> 00:32:03,588
Who said you could hit me?

431
00:32:03,671 --> 00:32:05,924
I see they don't call it an orphanage
these days.

432
00:32:06,007 --> 00:32:07,216
Is this the place

433
00:32:07,884 --> 00:32:09,886
where you first started to make Holo?

434
00:32:10,386 --> 00:32:11,220
Back then--

435
00:32:11,304 --> 00:32:14,140
I was seven, an age
when most children make AI programs.

436
00:32:18,269 --> 00:32:20,605
We might as well go inside,
since we're here.

437
00:32:24,901 --> 00:32:25,944
Holo.

438
00:32:26,361 --> 00:32:28,071
Does this jog your memory?

439
00:32:30,073 --> 00:32:31,032
Not yet.

440
00:32:41,334 --> 00:32:42,585
How may I help you?

441
00:32:46,214 --> 00:32:48,466
-Are you...
-Right.

442
00:32:50,259 --> 00:32:51,135
Yes, hello.

443
00:32:51,219 --> 00:32:53,805
My gosh.

444
00:32:56,557 --> 00:32:59,477
I'm glad to see you grown up so well.

445
00:33:00,520 --> 00:33:04,440
You didn't get along with the other kids
and often got into fights.

446
00:33:04,607 --> 00:33:07,860
I was worried
because of that edgy personality of yours.

447
00:33:07,986 --> 00:33:09,070
He's still like that.

448
00:33:10,488 --> 00:33:12,782
-Do you remember anything?
-Not yet.

449
00:33:14,158 --> 00:33:15,451
Maybe the place has changed.

450
00:33:15,535 --> 00:33:21,290
Ma'am, then is there a place or object
that might help jog his memory?

451
00:33:21,374 --> 00:33:23,876
Oh, right. I wonder where I put it.

452
00:33:28,464 --> 00:33:31,009
Instead of playing
with the other children,

453
00:33:31,092 --> 00:33:33,386
Nan-do would always
come to the computer lab.

454
00:33:35,471 --> 00:33:37,015
Right, here it is.

455
00:33:44,564 --> 00:33:49,110
Hi, I'm Hello. What should we play today?

456
00:33:50,695 --> 00:33:55,074
Your name's Holo from now on.

457
00:34:03,291 --> 00:34:05,835
You left it behind
even though it seemed special to you.

458
00:34:05,918 --> 00:34:08,129
I kept it just in case
you came back for it.

459
00:34:08,212 --> 00:34:09,047
What is that?

460
00:34:10,214 --> 00:34:12,008
It looks like an amusing device.

461
00:34:12,091 --> 00:34:14,719
-This--
-I didn't forget it. I left it on purpose.

462
00:34:18,097 --> 00:34:19,057
I threw it away.

463
00:34:19,724 --> 00:34:20,808
Thank you, ma'am.

464
00:34:20,892 --> 00:34:22,894
Could we look around ourselves now?

465
00:34:23,561 --> 00:34:24,479
Sure.

466
00:34:24,562 --> 00:34:25,813
Thank you.

467
00:34:28,357 --> 00:34:30,401
Your mom made this for you, didn't she?

468
00:34:30,485 --> 00:34:31,444
What a waste of time.

469
00:34:31,527 --> 00:34:33,446
Let's go. I'd rather not stay here long.

470
00:34:33,529 --> 00:34:34,739
When you were young,

471
00:34:35,865 --> 00:34:38,618
-you wouldn't go anywhere without it.
-Throw it away!

472
00:34:38,910 --> 00:34:40,661
Did I not say that clearly enough?

473
00:34:46,334 --> 00:34:47,168
Wait.

474
00:34:48,461 --> 00:34:49,587
Hey.

475
00:34:50,129 --> 00:34:51,380
Hey, Seo Nan-do!

476
00:34:54,217 --> 00:34:55,384
Don't call me that!

477
00:34:59,555 --> 00:35:01,516
I know you hate remembering your past,

478
00:35:01,933 --> 00:35:03,851
but you share this memory
with your mom.

479
00:35:03,935 --> 00:35:06,479
What reason do you have
to detest this device so much?

480
00:35:06,562 --> 00:35:09,524
The mother who made me that
killed herself and left me all alone!

481
00:35:11,275 --> 00:35:13,778
At Namsan, on the day
we were supposed to meet.

482
00:35:30,503 --> 00:35:31,712
Hey!

483
00:35:32,922 --> 00:35:34,215
Hey.

484
00:35:40,096 --> 00:35:43,099
I'm going on a picnic to Namsan
with my parents tomorrow.

485
00:35:43,558 --> 00:35:44,767
Do you want to come too?

486
00:35:45,643 --> 00:35:48,604
All right. Tell your mom and join us.

487
00:35:48,688 --> 00:35:51,149
We'll see you at noon
at the Octagonal Pavilion.

488
00:35:53,401 --> 00:35:56,195
My mom told me to wait on a bench
and left.

489
00:35:57,029 --> 00:35:58,698
She said she'd come back soon,

490
00:35:59,115 --> 00:36:00,491
but she never did.

491
00:36:01,701 --> 00:36:03,244
No matter how long I waited.

492
00:36:04,370 --> 00:36:05,872
He's still waiting.

493
00:36:06,581 --> 00:36:07,874
He still is.

494
00:36:09,125 --> 00:36:10,668
At that place, at that time.

495
00:36:12,920 --> 00:36:15,339
-What are you talking about?
-Holo told me...

496
00:36:16,507 --> 00:36:18,843
that it felt as if someone
was waiting for him.

497
00:36:23,639 --> 00:36:25,391
Magic Mirror, Korea's top IT company,

498
00:36:25,474 --> 00:36:27,602
was caught hacking into
its competitor's server.

499
00:36:27,685 --> 00:36:31,022
Shouldn't you be grateful that
this hasn't immediately been made public?

500
00:36:31,105 --> 00:36:33,733
That's why we want a proper negotiation.

501
00:36:33,816 --> 00:36:36,194
So that neither party
suffers any consequences.

502
00:36:40,198 --> 00:36:41,490
Yoo-jin.

503
00:36:43,201 --> 00:36:44,452
I'll meet you downstairs.

504
00:36:44,535 --> 00:36:45,411
-Sure.
-Okay.

505
00:36:51,083 --> 00:36:52,501
May I have a word with you?

506
00:36:52,585 --> 00:36:54,921
You should have talked
to my lawyers first.

507
00:36:56,464 --> 00:36:58,299
Is it all right if I record this?

508
00:36:59,217 --> 00:37:00,760
I wanted to apologize.

509
00:37:01,886 --> 00:37:04,222
To whom?
I don't intend to accept an apology.

510
00:37:04,847 --> 00:37:06,682
This must be because of the lawsuit.

511
00:37:06,766 --> 00:37:09,644
I'll talk to Attorney Kim
and lower the settlement amount.

512
00:37:19,362 --> 00:37:21,447
The civil suit will cost us
a lot of money,

513
00:37:21,530 --> 00:37:23,699
but the real issue
is the police investigation.

514
00:37:23,783 --> 00:37:25,284
How do you think

515
00:37:25,368 --> 00:37:26,619
they found out

516
00:37:26,702 --> 00:37:28,621
that it was us exactly?

517
00:37:29,914 --> 00:37:32,500
I'm not sure, but my guess
is that the burner phone

518
00:37:32,583 --> 00:37:34,293
that was taken gave them a lead.

519
00:37:35,086 --> 00:37:36,504
What an idiot.

520
00:37:39,006 --> 00:37:41,384
The charges will be dropped soon.

521
00:37:41,467 --> 00:37:43,261
Pardon? How...

522
00:37:43,844 --> 00:37:48,975
You don't need to know.
Instead, get me a meeting with Miss Ko.

523
00:37:49,350 --> 00:37:51,435
She probably hates our guts,

524
00:37:51,519 --> 00:37:54,480
but I'm sure
you'll be able to persuade her.

525
00:37:54,563 --> 00:37:57,108
From what I hear, you two meet often

526
00:37:57,692 --> 00:37:59,235
and have grown close.

527
00:38:00,695 --> 00:38:01,821
I'll do that.

528
00:38:38,607 --> 00:38:40,443
Did you say the bench
by the streetlight?

529
00:38:41,610 --> 00:38:43,404
Yes, I think it was a blue bench.

530
00:38:44,655 --> 00:38:46,490
A blue bench.

531
00:38:46,574 --> 00:38:47,992
Where is it?

532
00:39:17,855 --> 00:39:19,482
I'll be right back,

533
00:39:19,565 --> 00:39:22,735
so stay here and don't wander off, okay?

534
00:39:27,031 --> 00:39:28,574
I said I'll be right back.

535
00:39:29,742 --> 00:39:31,786
Wait for me here, all right?

536
00:39:54,558 --> 00:39:57,061
HELLO

537
00:40:48,446 --> 00:40:52,366
You...
really have been waiting all this time.

538
00:41:05,421 --> 00:41:07,047
Are you waiting for your mom?

539
00:43:01,745 --> 00:43:02,746
What happened?

540
00:43:02,830 --> 00:43:05,249
Boss!
Holo's memory file has been activated.

541
00:43:13,257 --> 00:43:14,675
The boy was crying.

542
00:43:22,182 --> 00:43:23,309
Let's hurry back.

543
00:43:48,208 --> 00:43:49,585
Can you see me?

544
00:43:49,668 --> 00:43:50,544
So-yeon?

545
00:43:54,715 --> 00:43:56,133
So-yeon!

546
00:43:57,635 --> 00:43:59,637
What's wrong? Are you all right?

547
00:44:00,387 --> 00:44:01,305
Yes.

548
00:44:01,764 --> 00:44:03,849
My head started to ache. That's all.

549
00:44:05,893 --> 00:44:07,811
Let's take a break if you need to rest.

550
00:44:08,437 --> 00:44:11,940
No, Holo could be back to his old self,
so we should hurry back.

551
00:44:12,816 --> 00:44:13,734
Hold on.

552
00:44:17,655 --> 00:44:20,032
Climb on. It'll save us time.

553
00:44:41,428 --> 00:44:43,013
I'm fine now, you know.

554
00:44:43,722 --> 00:44:45,015
You can put me down.

555
00:44:45,974 --> 00:44:47,309
I'll be the judge of that.

556
00:44:51,021 --> 00:44:53,148
I just want to walk, that's all.

557
00:45:06,495 --> 00:45:09,164
You don't need to try to forgive her.

558
00:45:09,873 --> 00:45:12,334
Just be yourself and keep pushing forward.

559
00:45:13,293 --> 00:45:15,170
Don't be hurt by it either.

560
00:45:20,634 --> 00:45:22,302
My mother felt burdened by me.

561
00:45:24,221 --> 00:45:26,890
She was a poor researcher
raising a boy alone.

562
00:45:27,766 --> 00:45:30,018
How can you blame her
when I was a difficult child

563
00:45:30,102 --> 00:45:31,437
who couldn't adjust anywhere?

564
00:45:33,814 --> 00:45:35,482
That's why I sometimes think

565
00:45:36,734 --> 00:45:38,569
that if I had been more normal,

566
00:45:41,113 --> 00:45:42,781
if I wasn't who I am,

567
00:45:45,033 --> 00:45:46,160
my mom...

568
00:45:56,044 --> 00:45:59,965
When my parents got divorced
and my dad left the house,

569
00:46:00,048 --> 00:46:02,593
I went looking for him
without even putting on my shoes.

570
00:46:03,177 --> 00:46:06,221
But I couldn't find him,
because I couldn't recognize him.

571
00:46:07,264 --> 00:46:08,807
I wanted to cling onto him...

572
00:46:09,933 --> 00:46:11,894
and say that I was sorry.

573
00:46:15,522 --> 00:46:18,901
I thought that my parents split up
because of how I was.

574
00:46:19,067 --> 00:46:20,569
That's what I thought.

575
00:46:25,991 --> 00:46:27,242
It wasn't because of you.

576
00:46:28,243 --> 00:46:29,453
It's not your fault.

577
00:46:32,539 --> 00:46:33,791
The same goes for you.

578
00:46:37,377 --> 00:46:40,088
So we never got to meet back then,

579
00:46:40,672 --> 00:46:42,841
but we ended up together here now.

580
00:46:44,259 --> 00:46:46,345
I didn't think you'd remember me.

581
00:46:46,970 --> 00:46:48,806
I'm glad that you do, though.

582
00:46:50,349 --> 00:46:54,728
-Why are you thanking me for that?
-Because I like you.

583
00:47:00,526 --> 00:47:02,653
I don't have any family or friends.

584
00:47:03,153 --> 00:47:05,489
The only memories I have
are of the times I spent with you.

585
00:47:06,156 --> 00:47:07,825
I'm glad that I got to...

586
00:47:08,951 --> 00:47:10,160
meet you again.

587
00:47:12,913 --> 00:47:14,790
I'm glad that you are this way.

588
00:47:15,332 --> 00:47:19,378
I have no family,
and you're my one and only friend.

589
00:47:19,461 --> 00:47:21,046
The only memories I have

590
00:47:21,672 --> 00:47:23,298
are of the times I spent with you.

591
00:47:25,634 --> 00:47:26,927
That was you, wasn't it?

592
00:47:27,594 --> 00:47:28,804
At the playground.

593
00:47:46,864 --> 00:47:47,739
Are you back now?
