1
00:00:42,542 --> 00:00:44,127
I'll give you the glasses,

2
00:00:45,587 --> 00:00:47,213
so let me meet Holo.

3
00:00:49,632 --> 00:00:51,217
I'd like to meet him...

4
00:00:52,927 --> 00:00:54,012
once more

5
00:00:55,055 --> 00:00:56,723
and tell him I'm sorry.

6
00:01:02,270 --> 00:01:04,856
At least let me say goodbye to him.

7
00:01:06,399 --> 00:01:09,235
I won't hand over the glasses until I do.

8
00:01:17,285 --> 00:01:19,579
-Hello?
-Where are you?

9
00:01:20,246 --> 00:01:21,664
I'm just...

10
00:01:24,876 --> 00:01:25,960
What?

11
00:01:27,837 --> 00:01:29,089
Let me talk to her.

12
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:34,594
Miss Han So-yeon?

13
00:01:35,678 --> 00:01:38,014
This is Detective Nam. We met last time.

14
00:01:38,348 --> 00:01:41,267
I have a few questions to ask
about this incident.

15
00:01:41,518 --> 00:01:44,395
I'm sorry, but I have something urgent
going on now.

16
00:01:44,896 --> 00:01:47,398
I'll call you back later. I'm sorry.

17
00:01:49,692 --> 00:01:51,611
Someone broke into my house.

18
00:01:52,403 --> 00:01:53,613
Nothing was stolen.

19
00:01:53,696 --> 00:01:55,323
It must've been them.

20
00:01:55,698 --> 00:01:59,452
If you keep those glasses,
you could be in danger.

21
00:01:59,536 --> 00:02:01,996
I'll give you back the glasses,
so please--

22
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:05,416
Put them in this,
and go back to your old life.

23
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:07,877
I promised Holo when I first met him.

24
00:02:08,586 --> 00:02:10,839
I promised not to tell anyone about Holo.

25
00:02:11,297 --> 00:02:14,384
And he promised me as well...

26
00:02:15,426 --> 00:02:18,429
that he'd always be by my side.

27
00:02:21,349 --> 00:02:23,560
I know that this will end someday.

28
00:02:24,269 --> 00:02:26,729
But I can't just end things like this.

29
00:02:58,219 --> 00:03:02,390
KO YOO-JIN

30
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:05,643
You'll be directed to voicemail
after the tone

31
00:03:05,727 --> 00:03:08,062
and you will be charged for your call.

32
00:03:08,146 --> 00:03:10,565
He never picks up right away.

33
00:03:12,984 --> 00:03:16,404
-Thank you.
-You shouldn't thank me yet.

34
00:03:16,487 --> 00:03:18,656
If you go and talk to him in person,

35
00:03:18,907 --> 00:03:20,742
you might change your mind.

36
00:04:01,366 --> 00:04:02,367
Holo...

37
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:13,419
I'm sorry.
I shouldn't have said those words.

38
00:04:13,503 --> 00:04:14,671
No, it's...

39
00:04:15,129 --> 00:04:16,547
I mean, I...

40
00:04:17,215 --> 00:04:18,216
Tell her.

41
00:04:22,220 --> 00:04:23,513
I was hacked.

42
00:04:24,305 --> 00:04:25,848
That's why I disappeared.

43
00:04:27,684 --> 00:04:28,518
What?

44
00:04:30,228 --> 00:04:32,730
I thought it was because of me...

45
00:04:32,814 --> 00:04:34,732
No, it was nothing like that.

46
00:04:37,318 --> 00:04:39,153
So, are you okay now?

47
00:04:39,529 --> 00:04:41,823
Well, I've been partly restored,

48
00:04:44,117 --> 00:04:45,535
but I'm still unstable.

49
00:04:45,702 --> 00:04:47,078
You told me...

50
00:04:47,161 --> 00:04:50,248
that we were able to meet
because you weren't perfect yet.

51
00:04:50,331 --> 00:04:54,127
Right. But there's still a lot to fix,

52
00:04:54,460 --> 00:04:57,297
so I have to run some more tests
with Miss Ko.

53
00:04:58,589 --> 00:05:01,301
Can you sit over there
and wait for a little while?

54
00:05:01,384 --> 00:05:03,136
Are you going to disappear again?

55
00:05:03,219 --> 00:05:07,140
I'll get things fixed and be back soon.
Miss Ko is really skilled.

56
00:05:10,476 --> 00:05:11,477
Well...

57
00:05:15,690 --> 00:05:18,901
She may look a bit cold,
but she's actually really kind.

58
00:05:18,985 --> 00:05:20,903
She's very warmhearted.

59
00:05:24,032 --> 00:05:26,242
Can you wait over there for a moment?

60
00:05:26,826 --> 00:05:27,869
-Okay.
-Okay.

61
00:05:30,788 --> 00:05:32,874
Come on, please...

62
00:05:39,881 --> 00:05:41,382
What are you thinking?

63
00:05:41,466 --> 00:05:42,633
She'll hear you!

64
00:05:42,717 --> 00:05:43,593
Let her hear me!

65
00:05:43,676 --> 00:05:46,012
-I'm going to talk louder.
-Please! Yoo-jin!

66
00:05:46,095 --> 00:05:47,430
Please. Come on.

67
00:05:47,513 --> 00:05:51,059
My gosh. I brought her here
so you'd tell her the truth.

68
00:05:51,642 --> 00:05:53,686
You're such a pain in the ass!

69
00:05:53,853 --> 00:05:56,356
How can I tell her
when she's looking at me like that?

70
00:05:56,439 --> 00:05:59,150
And if I tell her,
she's going to run out, straight away.

71
00:05:59,317 --> 00:06:02,278
Think about it. The hack failed,
but Holo's still a mess.

72
00:06:02,362 --> 00:06:04,113
Those guys are probably desperate now.

73
00:06:04,197 --> 00:06:05,907
What if they do something to her?

74
00:06:05,990 --> 00:06:09,035
I think they've done something already.
They went through her house.

75
00:06:09,118 --> 00:06:11,329
See? And that...

76
00:06:12,205 --> 00:06:13,748
That detective, Nam Gi-ho.

77
00:06:14,082 --> 00:06:17,335
He suspects Holo of being
behind the hacking incident.

78
00:06:17,418 --> 00:06:19,921
-Do you really expect me to believe that?
-It's true.

79
00:06:20,004 --> 00:06:21,130
How would they know?

80
00:06:21,214 --> 00:06:24,592
I mean it! That's why I went
to the botanical gardens.

81
00:06:24,675 --> 00:06:27,512
We might have fooled her for now,
but if we let her go back,

82
00:06:27,595 --> 00:06:29,931
she's going to come back
and keep asking questions.

83
00:06:30,515 --> 00:06:32,392
So what do you want me to do?

84
00:06:32,809 --> 00:06:35,603
Since things turned out this way,
just help me out a little.

85
00:06:36,104 --> 00:06:37,146
Han So-yeon...

86
00:06:39,482 --> 00:06:40,858
should stay here for a while.

87
00:06:54,539 --> 00:06:55,623
Wow.

88
00:07:11,889 --> 00:07:14,934
It's Han So-yeon!

89
00:07:15,184 --> 00:07:17,603
Do you... know me?

90
00:07:18,271 --> 00:07:19,230
Well, no.

91
00:07:19,939 --> 00:07:22,650
I don't really know you...

92
00:07:22,733 --> 00:07:24,944
but I monitored the screen

93
00:07:25,027 --> 00:07:28,322
shown through the HoloGlass
in order to carry out the beta test, so...

94
00:07:29,532 --> 00:07:30,825
But...

95
00:07:32,702 --> 00:07:35,288
you were monitoring the screen
the whole time?

96
00:07:35,371 --> 00:07:36,581
Yes, that's my job.

97
00:07:38,332 --> 00:07:39,667
Oh, my gosh.

98
00:07:40,084 --> 00:07:43,129
No, it's not like that at all.

99
00:07:43,212 --> 00:07:45,590
Things related to personal privacy

100
00:07:45,673 --> 00:07:49,093
are censored automatically by Holo.

101
00:07:49,177 --> 00:07:52,263
Or else it'll be a problem.
Did you think we'd do such a thing?

102
00:07:53,764 --> 00:07:55,975
-I'm sorry.
-It's fine.

103
00:07:56,392 --> 00:08:00,021
But seeing you in person, you're...

104
00:08:00,104 --> 00:08:02,023
you're really beautiful.

105
00:08:02,106 --> 00:08:03,483
Oh, don't say that.

106
00:08:04,108 --> 00:08:05,234
Thanks.

107
00:08:05,318 --> 00:08:06,736
I haven't introduced myself.

108
00:08:06,819 --> 00:08:10,531
I'm Cho Jin-seok,
the senior programmer at GIO.

109
00:08:10,615 --> 00:08:12,366
-Oh, I see.
-Yes.

110
00:08:12,450 --> 00:08:16,746
Then can I ask you something about Holo?

111
00:08:16,829 --> 00:08:18,289
Yes, of course. Anything.

112
00:08:18,372 --> 00:08:20,333
Did Miss Ko really make Holo?

113
00:08:21,792 --> 00:08:23,878
How much do you know?

114
00:08:23,961 --> 00:08:25,296
I mean, it's--

115
00:08:25,379 --> 00:08:27,423
Miss Han, come upstairs
with me for a moment?

116
00:08:27,507 --> 00:08:28,508
What about Holo?

117
00:08:28,591 --> 00:08:30,635
-You can meet him upstairs.
-Oh, okay.

118
00:08:30,718 --> 00:08:31,928
Holo's been restored?

119
00:08:32,011 --> 00:08:33,137
Then I should...

120
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:42,855
What was that? Did I...

121
00:08:44,232 --> 00:08:45,775
miss something again?

122
00:08:47,652 --> 00:08:49,862
You want me to stay here for a while?

123
00:08:49,946 --> 00:08:50,905
Yes.

124
00:08:52,073 --> 00:08:54,367
Miss Ko said it'll be safer for you.

125
00:08:56,827 --> 00:08:58,162
But what about work?

126
00:08:58,246 --> 00:09:00,581
I got most of the urgent work done, but...

127
00:09:00,998 --> 00:09:03,751
Why not take some days off?
All you did was work until now.

128
00:09:04,293 --> 00:09:06,671
Right, I couldn't use my leave last time.

129
00:09:07,129 --> 00:09:09,090
-Then let's go tomorrow and--
-It's fine.

130
00:09:09,757 --> 00:09:12,009
Miss Ko will take care of that for you.

131
00:09:16,556 --> 00:09:18,474
-Really?
-She'll go and get your clothes

132
00:09:18,558 --> 00:09:19,934
and the things you'll need.

133
00:09:20,017 --> 00:09:23,229
So all you have to do is just relax
and enjoy your leave with me.

134
00:09:23,312 --> 00:09:24,939
Until I'm all fixed.

135
00:09:25,022 --> 00:09:26,107
Okay.

136
00:09:40,454 --> 00:09:42,248
Do you think they targeted Han So-yeon

137
00:09:42,331 --> 00:09:44,709
instead of Ko Nan-do
since she's his girlfriend?

138
00:09:44,792 --> 00:09:50,631
They pretended to have a grudge
against Ko Nan-do so we'd get distracted.

139
00:09:50,715 --> 00:09:53,759
-They were after something else.
-You mean...

140
00:09:53,843 --> 00:09:57,555
It must be something related to the AI
being developed at GIO Lab.

141
00:09:57,638 --> 00:10:02,101
Why would an ordinary woman like her
be in possession of such a valuable item?

142
00:10:02,184 --> 00:10:03,519
Think of it the other way.

143
00:10:03,603 --> 00:10:07,982
Why are these incidents happening
around that ordinary woman?

144
00:10:08,065 --> 00:10:09,358
It's simple.

145
00:10:09,442 --> 00:10:11,068
We just have to follow her.

146
00:10:11,152 --> 00:10:12,778
You couldn't find it?

147
00:10:15,156 --> 00:10:19,952
Investigate all her coworkers, family,
and acquaintances, and find it!

148
00:10:23,831 --> 00:10:24,915
Sir...

149
00:10:25,166 --> 00:10:28,669
The police are already watching her
as well as Ko Nan-do.

150
00:10:28,753 --> 00:10:32,214
Any further action on our part
could put our company at risk.

151
00:10:35,134 --> 00:10:39,096
It sounds
as if you're secretly relieved about this.

152
00:10:42,433 --> 00:10:45,978
Do you think
this will make you look less incompetent?

153
00:10:46,062 --> 00:10:47,063
I'm sorry.

154
00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:51,609
Sit!

155
00:10:58,074 --> 00:11:00,743
It feels like I'm only making
things worse by being here.

156
00:11:01,535 --> 00:11:03,746
I'll step down
like you told me to last time

157
00:11:03,829 --> 00:11:05,164
and clean up this mess.

158
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:29,230
You dare...

159
00:11:48,541 --> 00:11:50,835
Make yourself at home and relax.

160
00:11:50,918 --> 00:11:53,754
Thank you.
Is there anything I can help with?

161
00:11:53,838 --> 00:11:55,506
Just...

162
00:11:56,048 --> 00:11:57,842
just be yourself.

163
00:11:57,925 --> 00:12:01,345
Acting like your usual self
will probably help Holo recover.

164
00:12:01,429 --> 00:12:02,513
Be myself...

165
00:12:03,097 --> 00:12:04,473
Thank you, Miss Ko.

166
00:12:05,224 --> 00:12:09,186
Oh, right. There's important equipment
in that room, so don't open it.

167
00:12:09,270 --> 00:12:11,522
-Okay.
-All right, then. Get some rest.

168
00:12:22,366 --> 00:12:25,202
-What do you think?
-It's a bit sudden, but I like this.

169
00:12:25,745 --> 00:12:29,248
I got to meet you again,
and now I can be with you.

170
00:12:29,832 --> 00:12:31,333
Me too.

171
00:12:32,209 --> 00:12:34,879
Why are you just standing there?
Come here, sit down.

172
00:12:35,671 --> 00:12:36,672
Oh, okay.

173
00:12:46,515 --> 00:12:48,893
Why are you sitting so far away from me?

174
00:12:49,643 --> 00:12:51,020
Well, the thing is--

175
00:12:51,103 --> 00:12:53,272
What I said must have bothered you a lot.

176
00:12:54,190 --> 00:12:56,442
What I said about

177
00:12:56,859 --> 00:13:00,029
wanting to touch you
and wanting you to be real...

178
00:13:00,738 --> 00:13:02,198
I shouldn't have said that.

179
00:13:02,281 --> 00:13:06,035
You've already done so much for me.
Too much, in fact.

180
00:13:07,787 --> 00:13:11,332
Anyway, I'll never hurt you
like that again.

181
00:13:11,916 --> 00:13:13,000
It's fine.

182
00:13:14,543 --> 00:13:16,837
It must've been a tough day.
Aren't you tired?

183
00:13:17,922 --> 00:13:19,965
You know me so well.

184
00:13:22,885 --> 00:13:24,887
All right, get some rest, then.

185
00:13:24,970 --> 00:13:26,013
Hey...

186
00:13:28,182 --> 00:13:31,477
Won't you count sheep for me?

187
00:13:32,895 --> 00:13:33,896
"Sheep"?

188
00:13:35,272 --> 00:13:39,068
Five thousand two hundred
fifty-one sheep...

189
00:13:39,652 --> 00:13:42,446
Five thousand two hundred
fifty-two sheep...

190
00:13:43,948 --> 00:13:46,033
Five thousand...

191
00:14:34,206 --> 00:14:35,082
Hey, Boss.

192
00:14:35,165 --> 00:14:37,376
I heard you didn't tell Miss Han

193
00:14:37,459 --> 00:14:38,544
-the truth.
-Right.

194
00:14:39,003 --> 00:14:40,963
But you seem to be in a great mood.

195
00:14:41,046 --> 00:14:43,966
There's nothing to be upset about.
It's not like Holo was stolen.

196
00:14:44,383 --> 00:14:46,635
Think of it as a security test
before launch.

197
00:14:49,889 --> 00:14:51,891
How long will it take to restore him?

198
00:14:51,974 --> 00:14:54,059
Fortunately, we got the estimate.

199
00:14:54,602 --> 00:14:57,396
About two weeks at best.

200
00:15:01,150 --> 00:15:04,612
-Two weeks?
-Oh, no. About ten days. Ten.

201
00:15:04,695 --> 00:15:07,114
-Ten days?
-No. It'll only take a week.

202
00:15:09,491 --> 00:15:10,326
A week?

203
00:15:11,118 --> 00:15:13,412
Boss, I can't get it done
any faster than that--

204
00:15:13,495 --> 00:15:14,622
No.

205
00:15:15,956 --> 00:15:18,959
What if errors occur
while trying to rush the restoration?

206
00:15:19,043 --> 00:15:20,419
Take your time.

207
00:15:20,502 --> 00:15:24,757
Be very careful and meticulous.

208
00:15:25,633 --> 00:15:26,675
Okay?

209
00:15:28,928 --> 00:15:30,304
Okay.

210
00:15:30,679 --> 00:15:32,848
-Let's reset this and start over.
-What?

211
00:15:34,391 --> 00:15:35,601
Be very cautious.

212
00:15:35,684 --> 00:15:36,769
Okay.

213
00:15:38,103 --> 00:15:39,355
Slowly.

214
00:15:40,856 --> 00:15:42,232
Very slowly...

215
00:15:43,651 --> 00:15:47,237
My friend

216
00:15:52,326 --> 00:15:55,454
Ko Nan-do, that total pain in the neck.

217
00:15:59,625 --> 00:16:00,918
One more bottle?

218
00:16:01,585 --> 00:16:02,544
I agree!

219
00:16:02,670 --> 00:16:04,129
I think you've had enough.

220
00:16:04,213 --> 00:16:05,047
No.

221
00:16:05,297 --> 00:16:07,841
You can't stop me.

222
00:16:08,717 --> 00:16:12,721
You have to agree with me.
I disagree with your disagreement.

223
00:16:16,433 --> 00:16:18,185
My goodness.

224
00:16:19,395 --> 00:16:21,146
Ma'am, we'll have another bottle.

225
00:16:22,147 --> 00:16:25,401
You know, your name's really unique.
Who came up with it?

226
00:16:25,484 --> 00:16:26,694
My mother.

227
00:16:27,111 --> 00:16:29,446
Don't fathers usually name their children?

228
00:16:29,530 --> 00:16:31,532
He was really busy with his research.

229
00:16:31,615 --> 00:16:35,828
When I was young, I barely got to see him
once every few months.

230
00:16:37,705 --> 00:16:41,291
-That's harsh.
-So whenever I saw him,

231
00:16:42,084 --> 00:16:44,044
I told him new words I learned,

232
00:16:44,420 --> 00:16:46,463
showed off my drawings,

233
00:16:46,922 --> 00:16:49,425
or read books to get compliments from him.

234
00:16:50,342 --> 00:16:53,512
Then my father would look at me and say,

235
00:16:54,179 --> 00:16:56,974
"I hope what I make
will be smarter than you."

236
00:16:58,767 --> 00:17:00,644
Why does he bother making an AI

237
00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:04,023
when he doesn't even understand
how people feel?

238
00:17:04,106 --> 00:17:06,191
-Don't you agree?
-You're right.

239
00:17:06,275 --> 00:17:08,110
All right, then. Bottoms up!

240
00:17:08,902 --> 00:17:10,279
I agree!

241
00:17:11,363 --> 00:17:12,531
I agree, too.

242
00:17:12,614 --> 00:17:13,449
Cheers.

243
00:17:14,408 --> 00:17:15,534
Oh, my gosh.

244
00:17:18,078 --> 00:17:20,873
It's really nice to have someone
take care of me for a change

245
00:17:20,956 --> 00:17:24,334
after always being the one
who takes care of someone else's mess.

246
00:17:25,002 --> 00:17:26,128
Oh, be careful.

247
00:17:27,212 --> 00:17:31,008
You're in a similar situation, too.

248
00:17:32,801 --> 00:17:36,472
You take care of your father
and the company.

249
00:17:37,264 --> 00:17:40,559
But you have no one to take care of you.

250
00:17:41,310 --> 00:17:42,478
Don't you think so?

251
00:17:44,605 --> 00:17:45,898
I guess so.

252
00:17:49,943 --> 00:17:53,947
Then I'll take care of you.

253
00:18:02,122 --> 00:18:03,207
Bye.

254
00:18:17,096 --> 00:18:18,388
Bye!

255
00:18:19,932 --> 00:18:21,517
I agree!

256
00:18:24,686 --> 00:18:25,813
See you again next time!

257
00:18:38,700 --> 00:18:41,787
It will be clear during the day,
but with a little shower

258
00:18:43,122 --> 00:18:43,956
in the afternoon.

259
00:18:44,581 --> 00:18:47,251
There's a 70 percent chance of rain.

260
00:18:49,086 --> 00:18:51,505
The temperature during the day...

261
00:18:52,214 --> 00:18:53,090
will be 17 degrees.

262
00:18:54,091 --> 00:18:55,134
Fine dust levels...

263
00:18:56,009 --> 00:18:57,344
Damn, it's hot.

264
00:18:58,178 --> 00:18:59,221
Normal.

265
00:19:03,725 --> 00:19:07,354
I'm Holo, the world's first hologram AI
that only you can see

266
00:19:08,313 --> 00:19:09,356
with those glasses on.

267
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:31,128
-You're up.
-Yes.

268
00:19:31,712 --> 00:19:34,840
I have to get to work. What time is it?

269
00:19:38,135 --> 00:19:39,595
I'm on leave, right?

270
00:19:42,264 --> 00:19:47,436
Oh, the weather is so nice.
I heard it's going to rain, though.

271
00:19:49,813 --> 00:19:50,939
Wow.

272
00:19:54,026 --> 00:19:55,319
-What is it?
-What?

273
00:19:58,614 --> 00:20:00,324
Well, the thing is...

274
00:20:01,158 --> 00:20:05,871
It's going to rain in the evening.
Or was it the afternoon? Anyway...

275
00:20:09,458 --> 00:20:10,417
You...

276
00:20:13,086 --> 00:20:16,924
You're still not fully recovered, are you?
Look, you're stumbling.

277
00:20:19,551 --> 00:20:21,345
I'm hungry. What should I do?

278
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:23,931
Why don't you take something
from the fridge?

279
00:20:24,014 --> 00:20:26,391
-Nobody's here when Miss Ko's out.
-Really?

280
00:20:27,226 --> 00:20:29,978
Then should we cook something?
Like we used to?

281
00:20:30,896 --> 00:20:31,730
Sure.

282
00:20:35,984 --> 00:20:39,196
Wow, this fridge is huge.
There's everything we might need.

283
00:20:39,988 --> 00:20:41,156
What should we cook?

284
00:20:42,366 --> 00:20:45,160
-What about the cream risotto we made?
-"Cream risotto"?

285
00:20:45,244 --> 00:20:46,203
Yes.

286
00:20:46,828 --> 00:20:48,622
Hang on. Is there squid in here?

287
00:20:48,705 --> 00:20:49,539
Squid...

288
00:20:51,208 --> 00:20:52,709
There isn't any squid.

289
00:20:53,335 --> 00:20:56,046
Why don't we use abalones
instead this time?

290
00:20:56,129 --> 00:20:58,799
Abalones. Okay, let's use those.

291
00:20:58,882 --> 00:20:59,925
Great.

292
00:21:00,717 --> 00:21:01,593
All right.

293
00:21:04,846 --> 00:21:07,224
CREAM ABALONE RISOTTO

294
00:21:11,270 --> 00:21:13,021
Won't it be better
to order something?

295
00:21:13,105 --> 00:21:14,731
Why? This is fun.

296
00:21:18,694 --> 00:21:20,195
Hey, this smells amazing.

297
00:21:25,993 --> 00:21:26,868
Oh, gosh.

298
00:21:29,121 --> 00:21:33,083
-All right, I'm adding the abalones now.
-Don't you think there's too much oil?

299
00:21:33,166 --> 00:21:34,543
What?

300
00:21:36,295 --> 00:21:39,006
I think you should turn off. Oh, it's...

301
00:21:39,631 --> 00:21:41,925
-What? Is it hot?
-No. I thought it might be.

302
00:21:42,009 --> 00:21:44,094
-Focus when you're cutting.
-Gosh, I thought...

303
00:21:47,597 --> 00:21:49,266
Are you okay?

304
00:21:50,434 --> 00:21:52,102
I told you to focus!

305
00:21:55,856 --> 00:21:56,857
I was just...

306
00:21:57,941 --> 00:22:01,403
You weren't teaching me
step-by-step like you used to.

307
00:22:05,449 --> 00:22:08,160
-Why are you laughing?
-I've never seen you upset like that.

308
00:22:08,243 --> 00:22:10,579
You suddenly seem similar
to the guy next door.

309
00:22:12,122 --> 00:22:13,582
What do you mean?

310
00:22:13,707 --> 00:22:15,417
Because our voices are a bit similar?

311
00:22:15,500 --> 00:22:18,295
No. Now that I think about it,
your height and build--

312
00:22:18,378 --> 00:22:19,713
I'm not sure I can agree.

313
00:22:20,422 --> 00:22:21,298
That's burning.

314
00:22:21,381 --> 00:22:22,466
Hey!

315
00:22:22,549 --> 00:22:24,176
Damn it. What do I do?

316
00:22:30,432 --> 00:22:31,308
Well,

317
00:22:31,850 --> 00:22:35,479
I haven't been fully restored yet.
I guess I'm a bit lacking right now.

318
00:22:36,897 --> 00:22:40,192
-I'm sorry.
-No, I like you being like this, too.

319
00:22:40,984 --> 00:22:44,154
You're usually too perfect,
and you never make mistakes.

320
00:22:44,237 --> 00:22:46,615
You always had to take care of
the mistakes I made.

321
00:22:47,616 --> 00:22:53,080
But now you seem a bit clumsy
and have a bit of a temper.

322
00:22:53,872 --> 00:22:55,040
It's a new kind of charm.

323
00:22:56,666 --> 00:22:57,793
Like that?

324
00:22:58,710 --> 00:23:00,253
I'm not sure if it will be edible.

325
00:23:00,337 --> 00:23:01,755
No, I'm going to try it anyway.

326
00:23:10,889 --> 00:23:13,433
What is it? Is it that bad?

327
00:23:14,434 --> 00:23:18,021
No, it's actually pretty good.
How should I put it...

328
00:23:19,439 --> 00:23:22,901
It's a taste that I'll keep remembering.
Yes, that's it.

329
00:23:36,873 --> 00:23:38,625
What's this smell?

330
00:23:39,418 --> 00:23:41,378
Miss Ko. Do you want to join us?

331
00:23:45,924 --> 00:23:48,510
No, I'm fine. I have a bad hangover.

332
00:23:55,100 --> 00:23:57,811
Maybe it's because she has
a lot of free time on her hands.

333
00:23:57,894 --> 00:23:59,855
She seems to be drinking too often.

334
00:24:01,898 --> 00:24:04,151
-Enjoy your meal, you two.
-Okay.

335
00:24:07,154 --> 00:24:07,988
Oh, right.

336
00:24:09,197 --> 00:24:11,158
Holo can't actually eat.

337
00:24:14,077 --> 00:24:15,120
Gosh...

338
00:24:36,641 --> 00:24:38,143
Gosh, it's hot.

339
00:24:38,226 --> 00:24:39,811
Oh, Boss.

340
00:24:40,312 --> 00:24:42,355
I have to eat
before she finishes her shower.

341
00:24:42,439 --> 00:24:44,608
Why are you putting yourself
through all this?

342
00:24:47,611 --> 00:24:49,905
You must be quite thirsty.

343
00:24:49,988 --> 00:24:51,990
Here, drink this with your food.

344
00:25:05,712 --> 00:25:06,713
Boss.

345
00:25:07,297 --> 00:25:08,673
Take a look at this.

346
00:25:09,549 --> 00:25:13,303
Do you think setting it like this here
would work?

347
00:25:13,386 --> 00:25:14,679
Please check this.

348
00:25:21,436 --> 00:25:23,939
Hey, can you check the file
I just sent you?

349
00:25:24,022 --> 00:25:24,856
Okay.

350
00:25:26,858 --> 00:25:29,528
-Here's the data you asked for.
-Okay, thanks.

351
00:25:44,834 --> 00:25:45,835
Cheers.

352
00:25:55,095 --> 00:25:57,681
No, that's not it. Did you forget again?

353
00:25:58,348 --> 00:25:59,349
Look at me.

354
00:26:06,189 --> 00:26:07,315
Do it.

355
00:26:22,956 --> 00:26:23,999
That's it.

356
00:26:31,381 --> 00:26:32,799
Did you just hiccup?

357
00:26:35,260 --> 00:26:36,970
You're so funny.

358
00:27:25,769 --> 00:27:27,020
This is awkward.

359
00:27:27,270 --> 00:27:29,856
Drinking tea with you like this.

360
00:27:30,732 --> 00:27:31,858
Don't tease me.

361
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:35,362
-I'm sorry about last time.
-It's fine.

362
00:27:35,445 --> 00:27:37,238
-We're friends, aren't we?
-Right?

363
00:27:37,739 --> 00:27:39,908
Gosh, I was drinking because of him.

364
00:27:39,991 --> 00:27:41,451
"A lot of free time"?

365
00:27:42,410 --> 00:27:43,703
That jerk.

366
00:27:45,038 --> 00:27:46,831
Oh, I'm talking about my brother.

367
00:27:46,915 --> 00:27:48,166
Oh, right.

368
00:27:48,625 --> 00:27:51,127
He doesn't know what a pain
in the neck he is.

369
00:27:51,211 --> 00:27:54,589
It's obvious that's why
he's never even dated properly.

370
00:27:55,173 --> 00:27:58,301
Well, I've never actually
been in a proper relationship myself

371
00:27:58,385 --> 00:28:00,553
because I was always
busy taking care of him.

372
00:28:04,265 --> 00:28:06,017
So, how's the company?

373
00:28:06,851 --> 00:28:07,727
Well...

374
00:28:09,062 --> 00:28:12,357
Things are still hectic,
but we can take care of it.

375
00:28:13,441 --> 00:28:14,401
That's a relief.

376
00:28:14,859 --> 00:28:18,029
Ko Nan-do is the problem.
He just does whatever he pleases.

377
00:28:20,281 --> 00:28:23,076
Can we talk about something else
besides your brother?

378
00:28:26,371 --> 00:28:27,580
All right.

379
00:28:37,340 --> 00:28:41,010
Do you have nothing to talk about
besides your brother?

380
00:28:41,594 --> 00:28:44,305
-What?
-All you've been talking about so far

381
00:28:44,389 --> 00:28:47,016
is Ko Nan-do. That's it.

382
00:28:47,475 --> 00:28:50,186
-What are you trying to say?
-Do you like him?

383
00:28:50,270 --> 00:28:52,021
-Chan-sung.
-Well,

384
00:28:52,105 --> 00:28:54,733
it's possible
since he's not your real brother.

385
00:28:55,567 --> 00:28:56,651
Let's stop this.

386
00:28:59,237 --> 00:29:01,865
I guess you get drunk when you drink tea.

387
00:29:07,287 --> 00:29:08,496
Damn it.

388
00:29:10,874 --> 00:29:12,542
What have I done?

389
00:29:46,910 --> 00:29:48,495
Aren't you going to sleep?

390
00:29:48,787 --> 00:29:50,163
You'll faint at this rate.

391
00:29:50,246 --> 00:29:51,206
It's fine.

392
00:29:51,289 --> 00:29:52,207
Wake up.

393
00:29:52,540 --> 00:29:55,126
You're thrilled Han So-yeon
is smiling at you, aren't you?

394
00:29:55,210 --> 00:29:56,753
But she's smiling at Holo.

395
00:29:56,836 --> 00:29:58,338
Not at the liar Ko Nan-do.

396
00:29:59,839 --> 00:30:01,007
I know that.

397
00:30:38,503 --> 00:30:40,046
Can you hear me?

398
00:30:52,267 --> 00:30:55,353
Come on, hand it over. Let's play with it.

399
00:31:07,532 --> 00:31:10,618
On a lonely day

400
00:31:11,202 --> 00:31:15,582
-On a day we long for a friend
-What's his name?

401
00:31:17,375 --> 00:31:18,334
Mom.

402
00:31:19,460 --> 00:31:20,837
Mom.

403
00:31:22,005 --> 00:31:22,922
Mom.

404
00:31:26,217 --> 00:31:27,093
Holo.

405
00:31:29,178 --> 00:31:32,223
Your name's Holo from now on.

406
00:31:36,185 --> 00:31:37,145
What is this?

407
00:31:39,355 --> 00:31:41,399
-What?
-The guy next door.

408
00:31:41,774 --> 00:31:44,360
You reminded me of him,
so I asked if his cold got better,

409
00:31:44,444 --> 00:31:46,487
but he hasn't answered for hours.

410
00:31:47,947 --> 00:31:50,909
I'm sure he's busy.

411
00:31:50,992 --> 00:31:52,535
Maybe he's really sick.

412
00:31:57,332 --> 00:31:58,499
Is it really bad?

413
00:32:05,340 --> 00:32:08,343
-Or he could still be sleeping.
-Who would be asleep at this hour?

414
00:32:08,426 --> 00:32:10,303
He could be sleeping in
because he's sick,

415
00:32:10,386 --> 00:32:12,388
or he could've drunk a lot last night.

416
00:32:13,139 --> 00:32:15,224
He didn't seem to drink much.

417
00:32:19,520 --> 00:32:21,731
I'm sorry if I woke you up.

418
00:32:22,231 --> 00:32:23,441
MESSAGE FROM HAN SO-YEON

419
00:32:30,865 --> 00:32:33,743
I'm just asking
because I remembered you were sick.

420
00:32:38,706 --> 00:32:41,000
Why does it sound like it's ringing
in that room?

421
00:32:48,424 --> 00:32:50,802
It must be the equipment.

422
00:32:50,885 --> 00:32:53,554
Miss Ko told you not to go inside
because of them.

423
00:32:53,638 --> 00:32:54,931
No, I'm sure I heard...

424
00:32:57,934 --> 00:32:58,893
Hang on.

425
00:33:00,061 --> 00:33:01,521
Yoo-ram, hey.

426
00:33:12,281 --> 00:33:14,617
Your mother's nagging me
to come and get you.

427
00:33:14,701 --> 00:33:16,661
I told you, nothing's going on.

428
00:33:16,869 --> 00:33:19,872
I don't know. I can't tell her that
until I see for myself

429
00:33:19,956 --> 00:33:21,207
that you're really okay.

430
00:33:34,012 --> 00:33:34,929
Holo.

431
00:33:35,596 --> 00:33:37,640
Can I go home for a little while?

432
00:33:37,724 --> 00:33:39,809
-Why?
-I should go see Yoo-ram

433
00:33:39,892 --> 00:33:41,769
-and check on the guy next door--
-Why...

434
00:33:44,063 --> 00:33:45,398
Why would you do that?

435
00:33:45,481 --> 00:33:48,317
Well, it feels like I only visited him
or contacted him

436
00:33:48,401 --> 00:33:49,861
when I had favors to ask, so...

437
00:33:49,944 --> 00:33:51,446
He doesn't seem like a nice guy.

438
00:33:51,529 --> 00:33:54,782
He's rude when you're nice to him,
and he doesn't tell you his name.

439
00:33:54,866 --> 00:33:55,700
Maybe.

440
00:33:56,826 --> 00:33:59,078
But I think
he's actually pretending to be cold

441
00:33:59,162 --> 00:34:01,581
when he's not
because he doesn't want to get hurt.

442
00:34:04,208 --> 00:34:05,418
How would you know that?

443
00:34:07,211 --> 00:34:10,131
Well, because... I was like that, too.

444
00:34:12,759 --> 00:34:14,135
It just feels that way.

445
00:34:16,345 --> 00:34:18,431
-Still, I can't let you go.
-Why not?

446
00:34:19,640 --> 00:34:20,516
Are you...

447
00:34:21,476 --> 00:34:24,937
-jealous?
-No, it's because it might be dangerous.

448
00:34:25,021 --> 00:34:26,981
-And for security reasons.
-Okay,

449
00:34:27,065 --> 00:34:29,358
then I'll go outside
and meet Yoo-ram for a minute.

450
00:34:29,442 --> 00:34:31,360
My mom told her to check if I was okay.

451
00:34:33,654 --> 00:34:34,697
Oh, come on.

452
00:34:34,781 --> 00:34:38,117
It's kind of stuffy since I'm stuck here
all the time.

453
00:34:38,785 --> 00:34:41,412
Just 30 minutes.
You can come with me, then.

454
00:34:44,248 --> 00:34:45,083
Okay?

455
00:34:46,375 --> 00:34:47,668
Okay?

456
00:34:51,923 --> 00:34:53,174
You're not coming?

457
00:34:54,008 --> 00:34:56,052
There's signal interference
in the elevator.

458
00:34:56,135 --> 00:34:58,471
I'll go and get the car ready downstairs.

459
00:34:58,554 --> 00:34:59,472
Okay, see you there.

460
00:35:14,445 --> 00:35:16,072
Mr. Kim.

461
00:35:16,280 --> 00:35:17,990
Listen to me carefully.

462
00:35:24,872 --> 00:35:26,040
Are you okay, sir?

463
00:35:26,124 --> 00:35:26,958
Let's go.

464
00:35:27,041 --> 00:35:27,959
Your sweat!

465
00:35:28,042 --> 00:35:29,168
Sweat...

466
00:35:29,252 --> 00:35:30,461
Your hair.

467
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:36,968
The car...

468
00:35:40,888 --> 00:35:42,348
-Please get in.
-Yes, thank you.

469
00:35:46,060 --> 00:35:48,563
-You don't have to do this.
-No need to feel stressed.

470
00:35:48,646 --> 00:35:49,730
Excuse me?

471
00:35:49,814 --> 00:35:52,275
Oh, it's nothing. I talk to myself a lot.

472
00:35:52,775 --> 00:35:56,028
You can talk to him freely.
I work at GIO Lab, too.

473
00:35:56,112 --> 00:35:58,072
I guess Holo is here with you.

474
00:35:58,823 --> 00:36:00,992
Yes. Thank you.

475
00:36:06,914 --> 00:36:09,208
-How do I get in?
-I'll open the back door for you.

476
00:36:15,089 --> 00:36:16,591
Yes, I'm on my way.

477
00:36:17,175 --> 00:36:19,969
I'll see you at the café. Okay.

478
00:36:23,514 --> 00:36:25,433
We could've gone to my house for a minute.

479
00:36:25,516 --> 00:36:28,060
They could be watching your house, though.

480
00:36:29,770 --> 00:36:31,147
What's that?

481
00:36:32,023 --> 00:36:34,692
Oh, this?
There was some food left over,

482
00:36:34,775 --> 00:36:37,320
so I thought I'd give this
to the guy next door.

483
00:36:39,906 --> 00:36:41,324
You didn't have to...

484
00:36:41,407 --> 00:36:43,409
It seems like he has a really bad cold,

485
00:36:43,492 --> 00:36:45,661
and I said I'd treat him to a meal
last time.

486
00:36:45,745 --> 00:36:47,955
I couldn't just pretend
I didn't say anything.

487
00:36:48,497 --> 00:36:51,959
Well, I don't think he'd be
that grateful about this, though.

488
00:37:00,468 --> 00:37:01,636
Hey, So-yeon...

489
00:37:02,762 --> 00:37:04,430
If I were...

490
00:37:05,806 --> 00:37:07,058
If I...

491
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:12,605
I'm sorry.

492
00:37:15,524 --> 00:37:16,567
It's fine.

493
00:37:19,111 --> 00:37:21,656
Oh, what were you about to say?

494
00:37:23,115 --> 00:37:24,242
Oh, it's nothing.

495
00:37:24,575 --> 00:37:26,327
I think we're almost there.

496
00:37:26,786 --> 00:37:27,703
Yes.

497
00:37:36,212 --> 00:37:38,589
I feel like I'll be a distraction,
so I'll stay away.

498
00:37:40,549 --> 00:37:41,509
Okay.

499
00:37:41,592 --> 00:37:42,802
I'll see you later.

500
00:37:48,224 --> 00:37:50,726
Gosh, how lovey-dovey.

501
00:38:03,906 --> 00:38:04,949
Han So-yeon!

502
00:38:05,032 --> 00:38:06,075
Yoo-ram!

503
00:38:06,659 --> 00:38:08,703
Hey, it's been such a long time.

504
00:38:11,163 --> 00:38:15,167
So you're saying you can't tell me
the details because it's confidential,

505
00:38:15,251 --> 00:38:17,712
but you're participating
in some important development,

506
00:38:17,795 --> 00:38:20,089
-so you have to stay there for a while?
-Yes.

507
00:38:20,172 --> 00:38:22,800
There's not much I'm doing.
I'm just taking a vacation.

508
00:38:22,883 --> 00:38:24,760
You do look really well.

509
00:38:25,636 --> 00:38:27,805
I'm really getting the rest I needed.

510
00:38:28,472 --> 00:38:29,473
My gosh.

511
00:38:31,058 --> 00:38:32,226
I mean, he's a developer.

512
00:38:32,310 --> 00:38:34,937
Couldn't he think of a better excuse
to have you stay over?

513
00:38:35,021 --> 00:38:36,314
A developer? Who is?

514
00:38:36,397 --> 00:38:37,982
Your boyfriend, of course.

515
00:38:38,482 --> 00:38:39,900
What are you talking about?

516
00:38:39,984 --> 00:38:42,278
How long are you going
to keep up the act for?

517
00:38:42,361 --> 00:38:43,571
Your mother knows, too.

518
00:38:44,655 --> 00:38:47,074
My mother knows what, exactly?

519
00:38:47,158 --> 00:38:49,535
That you're dating the guy next door.

520
00:38:49,869 --> 00:38:52,413
She saw you on a date with him last time.

521
00:38:52,913 --> 00:38:53,748
What?

522
00:38:53,831 --> 00:38:56,375
So why don't you just introduce him
to me now?

523
00:38:56,459 --> 00:38:58,753
I saw you in the car together
when you arrived.

524
00:39:00,338 --> 00:39:01,922
Damn it, what do I do?

525
00:39:03,758 --> 00:39:05,926
What? You saw him?

526
00:39:07,011 --> 00:39:07,887
Really?

527
00:39:08,387 --> 00:39:11,932
Yes, my eyesight is 2.0 and 1.7.

528
00:39:12,600 --> 00:39:16,145
I don't need your company's glasses
even if I can get them for free.

529
00:39:21,609 --> 00:39:22,485
What's wrong?

530
00:39:25,488 --> 00:39:27,615
Where are you going? Hey!

531
00:39:36,665 --> 00:39:39,210
Holo, where are you? Come out.

532
00:39:39,293 --> 00:39:42,588
I thought you'd take a while,
so I'm running a systems check.

533
00:39:42,671 --> 00:39:45,341
-The graphics won't show up.
-It'll only take a moment.

534
00:39:45,424 --> 00:39:47,259
I have a weird feeling about something.

535
00:39:48,094 --> 00:39:50,054
-Come on!
-I can't do anything about it.

536
00:39:50,137 --> 00:39:51,138
Holo.

537
00:39:51,931 --> 00:39:52,890
I'm sorry.

538
00:39:58,813 --> 00:39:59,730
Taxi!

539
00:39:59,814 --> 00:40:02,149
-Where are you going?
-To my neighbor's house.

540
00:40:02,233 --> 00:40:03,567
I told you, it's dangerous.

541
00:40:03,651 --> 00:40:07,029
So-yeon, calm down and come
to the company. Let's talk there.

542
00:40:18,749 --> 00:40:20,000
Damn it.

543
00:40:20,918 --> 00:40:22,253
Damn it.

544
00:40:22,878 --> 00:40:25,131
Are you in some kind of hurry?

545
00:40:28,175 --> 00:40:30,511
Are the men after Han So-yeon again

546
00:40:31,262 --> 00:40:34,598
-because of the AI device she has?
-It's not that--

547
00:40:34,682 --> 00:40:35,516
Well...

548
00:40:36,559 --> 00:40:39,979
if it's smart enough to cause a blackout
with its own will,

549
00:40:40,062 --> 00:40:42,648
they'd do anything to get
their hands on it.

550
00:40:43,607 --> 00:40:46,986
I'm a bit busy right now,
so I'll listen to your nonsense later.

551
00:41:01,333 --> 00:41:02,460
Hurry. Come on.

552
00:41:25,149 --> 00:41:26,150
Damn it.

553
00:41:44,335 --> 00:41:45,544
Oh, gosh...

554
00:41:50,424 --> 00:41:51,926
Were you home?

555
00:41:53,886 --> 00:41:56,138
Why didn't you answer my calls?

556
00:41:57,848 --> 00:41:59,308
5 MISSED CALLS FROM HAN SO-YEON

557
00:42:05,022 --> 00:42:07,983
I HAVE BAD FLU AND MY VOICE
IS GONE. I WAS ABOUT TO TEXT YOU.

558
00:42:11,570 --> 00:42:12,571
Here, this is for you.

559
00:42:18,202 --> 00:42:19,870
What are you doing?

560
00:42:21,664 --> 00:42:22,540
I was...

561
00:42:23,415 --> 00:42:25,125
I'm sorry. Get some rest.

562
00:42:38,931 --> 00:42:39,890
Sir.

563
00:42:44,144 --> 00:42:46,814
I think she bought it for now.

564
00:42:47,356 --> 00:42:49,024
Did you see anyone suspicious?

565
00:42:49,108 --> 00:42:51,527
Oh, I was in a rush, so I'm not sure...

566
00:43:03,497 --> 00:43:04,498
We've located her.

567
00:43:04,582 --> 00:43:06,875
I'll take care of the police,

568
00:43:07,251 --> 00:43:09,920
so get the glasses no matter what!

569
00:43:24,602 --> 00:43:25,936
BAEK CHAN-SUNG

570
00:43:31,150 --> 00:43:32,067
What is it?

571
00:43:32,151 --> 00:43:33,277
Where's Han So-yeon now?

572
00:43:33,944 --> 00:43:34,820
What?

573
00:43:35,279 --> 00:43:38,657
-How do you know Han So-yeon--
-The men after the glasses are after her.

574
00:43:38,741 --> 00:43:40,409
I'll explain things later,

575
00:43:41,160 --> 00:43:42,328
so get her to safety.

576
00:43:52,796 --> 00:43:53,714
Holo.

577
00:43:54,757 --> 00:43:57,468
I'm here.
I just finished the testing.

578
00:43:58,552 --> 00:44:01,639
Did you give the food to your neighbor?
Let's go back now.

579
00:44:01,722 --> 00:44:02,640
Holo.

580
00:44:05,684 --> 00:44:07,102
KO NAN-DO

581
00:44:10,022 --> 00:44:12,608
Yes, Miss Ko. It's me, Jin-seok.

582
00:44:12,900 --> 00:44:14,610
Why are you answering his phone?

583
00:44:14,693 --> 00:44:18,197
Oh, Mr. Ko asked me
to do some urgent work for him, so...

584
00:44:21,200 --> 00:44:22,910
Gosh, what do I do?

585
00:44:26,622 --> 00:44:30,125
I keep having strange thoughts.
I want to ask you something.

586
00:44:30,751 --> 00:44:33,545
You can't lie,
so you'll answer me truthfully, right?

587
00:44:34,922 --> 00:44:36,590
I could try touching you right now,

588
00:44:36,674 --> 00:44:40,469
or I can take off my glasses
and check, but I want to hear it from you.

589
00:44:40,552 --> 00:44:41,762
So answer me.

590
00:44:45,766 --> 00:44:49,561
You're really Holo, right?

591
00:44:56,193 --> 00:44:57,569
I'll explain everything later.

592
00:44:58,153 --> 00:44:59,697
-So just come with me now.
-Wait...

593
00:44:59,780 --> 00:45:01,073
Get her!

594
00:45:03,492 --> 00:45:04,660
Get her!

595
00:45:06,537 --> 00:45:09,498
Mr. Cho, Holo's...

596
00:45:10,791 --> 00:45:12,793
What? What's going on?

597
00:45:12,876 --> 00:45:15,170
Why is it suddenly activating so quickly?

598
00:45:15,254 --> 00:45:17,172
-Did you do something?
-No.

599
00:45:17,256 --> 00:45:18,340
What's happening?

600
00:45:39,778 --> 00:45:40,863
Damn it.

601
00:45:41,405 --> 00:45:43,490
You go that way and you, come with me.

602
00:45:57,045 --> 00:46:00,758
How long have you been fooling me?
Since I went to GIO Lab? Or...

603
00:46:15,063 --> 00:46:15,939
Was it...

604
00:46:17,149 --> 00:46:18,400
Was it you then, too?

605
00:46:18,484 --> 00:46:20,527
Listen. I'm sorry.

606
00:46:20,903 --> 00:46:23,030
I'll explain everything later,
but for now--

607
00:46:23,113 --> 00:46:25,073
Why would you do such a thing?

608
00:46:26,200 --> 00:46:28,076
-Why?
-Because I like you.

609
00:46:31,747 --> 00:46:33,373
I have feelings for you.

610
00:46:33,999 --> 00:46:35,375
What are you talking about?

611
00:46:45,594 --> 00:46:47,095
-They're not there?
-No, sir.

612
00:47:17,209 --> 00:47:21,296
We seem to be looking for the same thing,
so let's work together.

613
00:47:21,922 --> 00:47:25,634
I'm Nam Gi-ho from the IT Division
at Seoul Police Agency. Where do you work?

614
00:47:25,717 --> 00:47:26,885
Well, we're...

615
00:47:28,220 --> 00:47:29,346
Run!

616
00:47:51,910 --> 00:47:53,245
Hey! That hurts!

617
00:47:54,121 --> 00:47:55,539
Where's Holo?

618
00:47:56,290 --> 00:47:58,292
Was he really hacked?

619
00:48:01,461 --> 00:48:02,504
Holo...

620
00:48:04,172 --> 00:48:06,842
You made him, right?
Based on your own face.

621
00:48:09,720 --> 00:48:12,556
Say something. Tell me what's going on.

622
00:48:13,974 --> 00:48:17,394
Anything. And not some nonsense
about you liking me.

623
00:48:25,319 --> 00:48:26,153
What is it?

624
00:48:26,236 --> 00:48:28,822
-Boss, Holo woke up.
-What?

625
00:48:29,448 --> 00:48:31,158
-Holo?
-Yes...

626
00:48:31,700 --> 00:48:34,870
but I think you should come here
and see for yourself.

627
00:48:34,953 --> 00:48:36,121
Okay.

628
00:48:39,791 --> 00:48:40,751
What is it?

629
00:48:41,376 --> 00:48:42,920
What happened to Holo?

630
00:48:52,888 --> 00:48:54,014
Boss.

631
00:48:55,766 --> 00:48:57,351
It's fine. What about Holo?

632
00:49:10,238 --> 00:49:11,114
Holo.

633
00:49:12,658 --> 00:49:13,533
Who are you?

634
00:49:23,752 --> 00:49:25,754
Those glasses look great on you.
