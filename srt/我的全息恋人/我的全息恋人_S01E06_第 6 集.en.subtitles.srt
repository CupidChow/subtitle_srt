1
00:00:47,005 --> 00:00:49,466
-What the hell?
-That face...

2
00:00:49,549 --> 00:00:53,386
I'm the model for Holo's beta version
and its creator.

3
00:00:54,846 --> 00:00:57,223
I'm Miss Ko's younger brother, Ko Nan-do.

4
00:00:57,849 --> 00:00:59,517
Due to personal reasons,

5
00:00:59,934 --> 00:01:02,270
I was late to introduce myself.
I apologize.

6
00:01:05,148 --> 00:01:06,441
I'll keep it short.

7
00:01:07,275 --> 00:01:09,444
The beta test will continue.

8
00:01:10,028 --> 00:01:11,780
-What the hell?
-What...

9
00:01:11,863 --> 00:01:13,948
-What is he saying?
-The test will continue?

10
00:01:14,032 --> 00:01:20,080
Even after deceiving all the investors,
you have the audacity to say that?

11
00:01:20,163 --> 00:01:22,415
Business isn't some game, you know.

12
00:01:22,499 --> 00:01:24,084
We began the beta test

13
00:01:24,167 --> 00:01:27,045
because an unknown error was detected
in Holo.

14
00:01:27,128 --> 00:01:29,756
However, we found out
that it wasn't an error after all.

15
00:01:29,839 --> 00:01:31,091
What are you talking about?

16
00:01:31,633 --> 00:01:33,051
If there's no error,

17
00:01:33,134 --> 00:01:35,053
the tests are no longer needed.

18
00:01:35,136 --> 00:01:38,181
By interacting with its user,
Holo was able to develop emotions.

19
00:01:38,264 --> 00:01:41,226
As a result, it was able to feel love.

20
00:01:41,392 --> 00:01:42,310
"Feel love"?

21
00:01:42,393 --> 00:01:46,397
-What is he talking about?
-It can feel love?

22
00:01:46,481 --> 00:01:51,111
Since it's one of humankind's
most intricate and innermost emotions,

23
00:01:51,194 --> 00:01:53,321
we need to conduct more beta tests.

24
00:01:53,404 --> 00:01:54,864
My offer is simple.

25
00:01:55,365 --> 00:01:59,661
An opportunity to meet an advanced AI
that can love humans has presented itself.

26
00:01:59,744 --> 00:02:01,579
Whether you'll bet on it or not...

27
00:02:02,831 --> 00:02:05,250
is a choice that you must make right now.

28
00:02:08,670 --> 00:02:10,755
Raise your hand
if you approve the beta test.

29
00:02:12,966 --> 00:02:13,925
Sure.

30
00:02:37,699 --> 00:02:39,450
Boss, how did it go?

31
00:02:42,287 --> 00:02:43,288
Ko Nan-do.

32
00:02:44,330 --> 00:02:48,209
You are under arrest in accordance with
article 12 of the Telecommunications Act

33
00:02:48,293 --> 00:02:51,421
and clause three of article 200
of the Criminal Procedure Act.

34
00:02:53,506 --> 00:02:56,759
You have a right to an attorney
and a chance to defend yourself--

35
00:02:56,843 --> 00:02:59,345
This is boring,
so give me the short version.

36
00:02:59,429 --> 00:03:02,390
Am I boring you?
You are a suspect of the blackout incident

37
00:03:02,473 --> 00:03:05,977
and a hacker who may flee the country.
Take him away.

38
00:03:20,241 --> 00:03:21,409
Oh, that blackout?

39
00:03:21,492 --> 00:03:24,871
Some weirdos were chasing me,
and I almost died in an accident.

40
00:03:25,580 --> 00:03:29,375
So let's hear why I've been arrested
instead of them.

41
00:03:32,754 --> 00:03:34,088
In New Zealand...

42
00:03:34,756 --> 00:03:36,049
about 12 years ago,

43
00:03:36,216 --> 00:03:39,010
a boy hacked into
our nation's computer network.

44
00:03:39,510 --> 00:03:41,721
The whole nation was in an uproar,

45
00:03:42,096 --> 00:03:44,307
and the boy committed suicide.

46
00:03:45,308 --> 00:03:47,393
This is the boy's fingerprint,

47
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:51,022
and this is the one found
on the recently confiscated evidence.

48
00:03:51,105 --> 00:03:52,857
The two are a 100% match.

49
00:03:53,858 --> 00:03:55,652
I don't know what trick you pulled,

50
00:03:56,069 --> 00:03:58,571
but you faked your death
and evaded the authorities.

51
00:03:58,655 --> 00:04:02,283
And now, you performed the same hack
and caused this blackout.

52
00:04:02,659 --> 00:04:06,371
I even witnessed
the hacking incident that occurred

53
00:04:06,454 --> 00:04:09,540
near Magic Mirror's headquarters.

54
00:04:11,834 --> 00:04:15,630
Are you remaining silent?
I will have the evidence soon.

55
00:04:34,732 --> 00:04:35,650
You're right.

56
00:04:36,859 --> 00:04:37,694
It was me.

57
00:04:38,611 --> 00:04:40,822
I'm that boy from 12 years ago.

58
00:04:41,781 --> 00:04:42,991
But this recent blackout?

59
00:04:43,074 --> 00:04:46,119
Whoever it is,
I'm grateful since it saved my life.

60
00:04:46,202 --> 00:04:48,788
However,
I didn't know it was due to a hack.

61
00:04:48,871 --> 00:04:51,499
-What?
-The same goes for the car accident.

62
00:04:51,582 --> 00:04:56,254
I almost got hit while standing there,
but cars came out of nowhere and saved me.

63
00:04:57,380 --> 00:04:59,674
All I can say is that I was lucky.

64
00:04:59,757 --> 00:05:03,386
What could a mere human do
in that situation anyway?

65
00:05:03,469 --> 00:05:05,054
So that's your story?

66
00:05:13,229 --> 00:05:15,315
Oh, good. Right on time.

67
00:05:15,398 --> 00:05:18,401
-Who are you people?
-I am Mr. Ko's attorney.

68
00:05:20,111 --> 00:05:22,655
I don't suppose we have to appeal
for a wrongful arrest.

69
00:05:22,739 --> 00:05:26,034
I believe it's in all our best interests
to release him.

70
00:05:26,117 --> 00:05:28,453
That's only true when there's no evidence.

71
00:05:30,079 --> 00:05:33,833
-What about the forensic test?
-They checked it thoroughly,

72
00:05:33,916 --> 00:05:37,253
-but it's clean.
-Gosh. I'm sorry there's nothing to find,

73
00:05:37,337 --> 00:05:39,130
but I can't say I'm surprised.

74
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:44,010
If you have nothing to hide,
why did you change your identity?

75
00:05:44,093 --> 00:05:46,512
The papers regarding
his citizenship status

76
00:05:46,596 --> 00:05:50,141
have been put together
and are ready for you to read.

77
00:05:51,017 --> 00:05:51,934
JEONGDO LAW FIRM

78
00:05:52,393 --> 00:05:55,688
For your information,
all the related fines have been paid.

79
00:05:56,481 --> 00:05:57,982
All right, then.

80
00:05:59,901 --> 00:06:00,902
Can I leave now?

81
00:06:04,030 --> 00:06:06,366
Wait, should I stay for a meal?

82
00:06:06,657 --> 00:06:08,993
I heard the police order you a stew
or something.

83
00:06:17,543 --> 00:06:20,922
-Gosh, that was close.
-Don't let your guard down just yet.

84
00:06:21,005 --> 00:06:23,633
That Detective Nam
keeps getting on my nerves.

85
00:06:24,217 --> 00:06:26,469
How did he find out about New Zealand?

86
00:06:28,513 --> 00:06:32,725
How come you didn't inform me of the plan
you and your lawyer concocted?

87
00:06:32,809 --> 00:06:36,479
What's important is
that he doesn't find out about Holo.

88
00:06:41,150 --> 00:06:43,152
I feel like we were conned.

89
00:06:49,534 --> 00:06:52,995
I should've known
that he'd have a backup plan.

90
00:06:55,248 --> 00:06:59,043
I feel like we're missing something.
What do you think it is?

91
00:07:02,171 --> 00:07:03,089
Ko Nan-do.

92
00:07:03,631 --> 00:07:06,801
Look into his family and past
before his adoption.

93
00:07:07,301 --> 00:07:09,053
VICE PRESIDENT BAEK CHAN-SUNG

94
00:07:28,948 --> 00:07:33,035
Must you make me come all the way here?
After all the time I gave you?

95
00:07:33,661 --> 00:07:35,872
-Father...
-Didn't I always tell you

96
00:07:35,955 --> 00:07:40,042
that you can't achieve anything
without getting your hands dirty?

97
00:07:40,126 --> 00:07:40,960
I'm sorry.

98
00:07:53,973 --> 00:07:55,141
It's fine.

99
00:07:55,224 --> 00:07:57,059
I'll handle it from here,

100
00:07:57,518 --> 00:08:00,354
so just take care of the mess you made.

101
00:08:00,438 --> 00:08:02,940
I don't want it
backfiring on our company later on.

102
00:08:04,442 --> 00:08:05,276
I understand.

103
00:08:24,962 --> 00:08:27,882
Have you always known
about his existence, then?

104
00:08:30,426 --> 00:08:31,677
Oh, well...

105
00:08:31,761 --> 00:08:34,639
He and I share
each other's ideas directly.

106
00:08:35,348 --> 00:08:39,060
What's he like?
Is he perfect and kind like Holo?

107
00:08:39,143 --> 00:08:41,479
-How should I put it?
-Hey!

108
00:08:46,442 --> 00:08:48,569
Shouldn't you be working?
Why are you out here?

109
00:08:48,653 --> 00:08:51,906
The employees are curious about you, Boss.

110
00:08:51,989 --> 00:08:55,618
To add love as one of Holo's features
is genius.

111
00:08:55,993 --> 00:08:58,287
I've given it some thought,

112
00:08:58,371 --> 00:09:01,707
and the feature could generate
a large profit for the company.

113
00:09:01,791 --> 00:09:04,710
By adding provocative outfits
and adjusting body measurements--

114
00:09:04,794 --> 00:09:07,255
Useless thinking like that
should be done at home.

115
00:09:07,338 --> 00:09:10,216
How soon can we separate
the server and the commercial version?

116
00:09:10,299 --> 00:09:13,427
-Why do you ask?
-It's nothing.

117
00:09:13,761 --> 00:09:16,889
What? You don't intend
to launch this version of Holo?

118
00:09:16,973 --> 00:09:18,182
What are you saying?

119
00:09:18,724 --> 00:09:21,894
I will launch it
since it's what I told the investors.

120
00:09:21,978 --> 00:09:24,605
However, just not the version of Holo

121
00:09:24,689 --> 00:09:27,149
that loves and is loved by Han So-yeon.

122
00:09:27,984 --> 00:09:30,152
A separate server and maintenance?

123
00:09:30,903 --> 00:09:33,489
Have you considered
the extra cost and time?

124
00:09:33,573 --> 00:09:36,701
Then... should I tell Holo
that since he's our product

125
00:09:36,784 --> 00:09:38,035
and source of profit,

126
00:09:38,119 --> 00:09:40,121
he should become a lover
for numerous users?

127
00:09:40,538 --> 00:09:43,124
-Should I?
-This isn't about money, though.

128
00:09:43,207 --> 00:09:44,083
Exactly.

129
00:09:44,166 --> 00:09:47,295
I wanted to launch Holo
so that I could protect him.

130
00:09:47,378 --> 00:09:49,505
Instead of an AI hologram
that is a threat,

131
00:09:49,589 --> 00:09:52,091
I wanted the world to know of a sweet
and generous one.

132
00:09:52,174 --> 00:09:55,052
Once many people
have their very own Holos,

133
00:09:55,136 --> 00:09:56,512
he'll be safe.

134
00:09:59,765 --> 00:10:01,726
The Holo we have right now is only hers.

135
00:10:01,809 --> 00:10:05,938
That's why protecting them both...
is now my job.

136
00:10:06,689 --> 00:10:07,940
Where are you off to?

137
00:10:08,774 --> 00:10:10,901
-Next door.
-And why would you go there?

138
00:10:10,985 --> 00:10:12,361
To protect them.

139
00:10:12,695 --> 00:10:14,572
They could be in danger again.

140
00:10:15,906 --> 00:10:21,162
-Besides, that detective still bugs me.
-Maybe you just want to be with her.

141
00:10:21,954 --> 00:10:23,122
Aren't you over her yet?

142
00:10:31,005 --> 00:10:34,800
Today,
we're with travel writer Lee Hye-yeong.

143
00:10:34,884 --> 00:10:37,637
I hear you've been to Iceland recently.

144
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:43,934
Yes, I always wondered if I'd be able
to see an aurora with my own two eyes.

145
00:10:44,018 --> 00:10:47,772
It's not something that's easily visible
even in Iceland.

146
00:10:47,897 --> 00:10:51,776
I saw it on my second day there, though.

147
00:10:51,942 --> 00:10:54,403
The scenery before my eyes

148
00:10:54,487 --> 00:10:57,114
was so breathtakingly beautiful

149
00:10:57,198 --> 00:11:00,076
that I thought my heart
was going to burst.

150
00:11:00,159 --> 00:11:02,203
Wow, I'm truly jealous.

151
00:11:02,495 --> 00:11:06,499
So what other beauties does Iceland
have to offer apart from the auroras?

152
00:11:06,582 --> 00:11:09,418
-What's on your mind?
-You can hike on the large glaciers.

153
00:11:11,045 --> 00:11:13,422
-I was reading up on auroras.
-On large glaciers?

154
00:11:13,506 --> 00:11:14,507
Yes.

155
00:11:14,590 --> 00:11:19,553
I was wondering what it'd be like
to see something so beautiful.

156
00:11:25,976 --> 00:11:27,561
Iceland and its aurora.

157
00:11:27,645 --> 00:11:31,065
We heard from travel writer Lee Hye-yeong.

158
00:11:31,148 --> 00:11:34,735
We'll now wrap up the show
with the last song of today.

159
00:11:36,946 --> 00:11:38,364
I should sleep.

160
00:12:29,623 --> 00:12:31,167
WORLD TOUR
RESULTS FOR "ICELAND"

161
00:12:39,133 --> 00:12:40,134
"So-yeon."

162
00:12:40,217 --> 00:12:41,343
PASSENGER INFORMATION

163
00:12:47,016 --> 00:12:47,892
What?

164
00:13:08,788 --> 00:13:09,622
Shoot.

165
00:13:15,336 --> 00:13:17,338
Darn it.

166
00:13:20,466 --> 00:13:21,550
Shoot, that hurts.

167
00:13:22,343 --> 00:13:23,260
What?

168
00:13:23,844 --> 00:13:25,721
I know you're in there. I can hear you.

169
00:13:25,805 --> 00:13:28,265
Do you know what time it is?
What do you want?

170
00:13:28,349 --> 00:13:31,811
It's urgent.
Can't you just open the door for a second?

171
00:13:32,645 --> 00:13:33,854
Fine. Just a second.

172
00:13:37,066 --> 00:13:39,568
Gosh, it's freezing. It's so cold outside.

173
00:13:39,652 --> 00:13:41,904
-Wait. Hold on.
-What do you think you're doing?

174
00:13:42,488 --> 00:13:43,531
Well...

175
00:13:45,866 --> 00:13:46,909
Why...

176
00:13:47,868 --> 00:13:50,329
are you dressed like that?

177
00:14:06,512 --> 00:14:08,138
You must have a really bad cold.

178
00:14:08,222 --> 00:14:10,391
Was this really urgent?

179
00:14:10,766 --> 00:14:12,601
Yes, it was.

180
00:14:16,772 --> 00:14:21,902
By the way, thank you for taking
my mom to the hospital that day.

181
00:14:21,986 --> 00:14:23,696
Is she doing better?

182
00:14:23,779 --> 00:14:26,782
Of course. She's nagging me more and more,
which proves she's fine.

183
00:14:26,866 --> 00:14:28,117
I'm glad.

184
00:14:36,917 --> 00:14:38,502
Are you gonna keep sitting there?

185
00:14:38,586 --> 00:14:43,048
Well, I'm sorry
that I asked a sick person for a favor.

186
00:14:43,465 --> 00:14:44,967
If so, you can at least...

187
00:14:45,718 --> 00:14:46,719
clean the house.

188
00:14:46,802 --> 00:14:47,970
What the...

189
00:14:48,053 --> 00:14:51,223
I guess I feel less guilty thanks to that.

190
00:14:51,891 --> 00:14:54,018
Gosh. Let's see.

191
00:14:54,602 --> 00:14:55,895
Where do I start?

192
00:14:55,978 --> 00:14:57,271
What should I do first?

193
00:14:59,106 --> 00:14:59,940
Goodness.

194
00:15:11,994 --> 00:15:15,998
For a while, you seemed depressed.
Have you gotten over your breakup now?

195
00:15:16,081 --> 00:15:19,251
You told me to express my emotions
honestly, right?

196
00:15:19,335 --> 00:15:20,711
So I did.

197
00:15:20,794 --> 00:15:21,879
Are you happier now?

198
00:15:23,464 --> 00:15:25,424
Yes, totally.

199
00:15:27,635 --> 00:15:28,802
Okay.

200
00:15:34,934 --> 00:15:39,188
On a lonely day

201
00:15:39,271 --> 00:15:43,776
On a day we long for a friend

202
00:15:43,859 --> 00:15:47,279
We make one

203
00:15:47,363 --> 00:15:50,491
That is cute and fascinating

204
00:15:50,741 --> 00:15:53,619
I'm making friends

205
00:15:53,869 --> 00:15:57,039
That nobody else knows about

206
00:15:57,206 --> 00:15:58,666
-That song.
-That nobody else...

207
00:15:58,749 --> 00:15:59,625
How do you know it?

208
00:15:59,708 --> 00:16:00,626
What song?

209
00:16:00,709 --> 00:16:02,252
The one you just sang.

210
00:16:02,336 --> 00:16:03,712
On a lonely day

211
00:16:03,796 --> 00:16:05,172
On a day we long for a friend

212
00:16:05,255 --> 00:16:08,342
Well, I heard it on TV.

213
00:16:08,926 --> 00:16:11,887
How fascinating.
I've loved that song since I was a girl.

214
00:16:11,971 --> 00:16:14,348
I haven't met anyone
who knows it too, though.

215
00:16:14,682 --> 00:16:17,518
I just realized that we don't even know
each other's names.

216
00:16:17,935 --> 00:16:18,769
What's yours?

217
00:16:28,988 --> 00:16:30,948
-Gosh.
-It's done.

218
00:16:31,657 --> 00:16:35,828
We're more than just strangers now,
so give me your number. I'll buy dinner.

219
00:16:44,712 --> 00:16:45,879
Dinner isn't necessary.

220
00:16:45,963 --> 00:16:47,214
NAME
NEXT DOOR

221
00:16:47,297 --> 00:16:50,009
Is your last name "Next"?

222
00:16:50,092 --> 00:16:51,552
Yes, fascinating, isn't it?

223
00:16:51,635 --> 00:16:53,762
It's a rare last name.
I'm the first generation.

224
00:16:54,304 --> 00:16:57,307
-Go before you catch a cold.
-Wait, but...

225
00:16:57,850 --> 00:16:58,976
Thank you.

226
00:17:07,860 --> 00:17:11,071
Shoot, I was sweating like crazy
in these warm clothes.

227
00:17:35,012 --> 00:17:36,555
CONTACT INFORMATION

228
00:17:40,726 --> 00:17:42,728
Yes, booking is complete.

229
00:17:49,401 --> 00:17:52,196
All is good now. Thanks, Mr. Next.

230
00:17:59,828 --> 00:18:05,209
ALL IS GOOD NOW. THANKS, MR. NEXT

231
00:18:07,795 --> 00:18:08,712
Shoot.

232
00:18:21,433 --> 00:18:23,852
Are you tired? How about some fresh air?

233
00:18:24,269 --> 00:18:25,270
I'm good.

234
00:18:25,354 --> 00:18:26,438
It's just my eyes.

235
00:18:27,022 --> 00:18:29,608
Maybe massaging them will help.

236
00:18:35,114 --> 00:18:38,325
AURORA TOUR

237
00:18:41,745 --> 00:18:42,913
What are you up to?

238
00:18:42,996 --> 00:18:44,623
Oh, it's nothing.

239
00:18:44,706 --> 00:18:48,252
As you know, our collaboration
with Magic Mirror was scrapped.

240
00:18:48,335 --> 00:18:50,045
Our team did a fantastic job, though.

241
00:18:50,129 --> 00:18:51,338
-Yes.
-However,

242
00:18:51,421 --> 00:18:53,549
I couldn't say that to the bosses.

243
00:18:53,632 --> 00:18:55,425
-That being said...
-Miss Park,

244
00:18:56,677 --> 00:18:57,636
my vacation days--

245
00:18:57,719 --> 00:19:00,430
Our team is taking on
the next season's draft.

246
00:19:00,514 --> 00:19:02,683
I didn't get to take
any days off last year.

247
00:19:02,766 --> 00:19:04,476
I need to go on a vacation this time.

248
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:07,020
-I even booked--
-I'm terribly sorry.

249
00:19:07,271 --> 00:19:09,231
Just help me out again this once.

250
00:19:09,356 --> 00:19:11,358
You can go after wrapping this up.

251
00:19:27,708 --> 00:19:32,045
-I'm screwed. My dreams have been crushed.
-I can help you with the work.

252
00:19:34,089 --> 00:19:35,424
That's not the issue.

253
00:19:38,218 --> 00:19:39,595
Truth be told,

254
00:19:40,596 --> 00:19:42,973
I wanted to go somewhere
really nice with you.

255
00:19:45,809 --> 00:19:49,855
You were thrilled
when we went to see the ocean.

256
00:19:50,314 --> 00:19:53,066
That's why I wanted to show you
something even better.

257
00:19:55,944 --> 00:19:57,112
Let's go, then.

258
00:19:58,280 --> 00:20:00,032
Right this moment.

259
00:20:01,575 --> 00:20:03,785
I doubt it'll be that cold.

260
00:20:32,064 --> 00:20:33,690
Don't just stand there...

261
00:20:34,650 --> 00:20:35,734
and sit over here.

262
00:20:42,407 --> 00:20:43,659
What is all this?

263
00:20:44,993 --> 00:20:46,787
-So-yeon.
-Yes?

264
00:20:46,870 --> 00:20:47,829
Look at that.

265
00:20:53,627 --> 00:20:54,670
My gosh.

266
00:20:57,422 --> 00:20:59,591
What do you think? Is it breathtaking?

267
00:21:00,759 --> 00:21:04,096
Your heart is beating faster than usual,
but I don't think it'll burst.

268
00:21:05,305 --> 00:21:09,017
I love it. I think I might even cry.

269
00:21:11,812 --> 00:21:16,024
Still, I wanted to show you a real aurora.

270
00:21:19,903 --> 00:21:22,572
If that's not real,
then I'm not real either?

271
00:21:25,367 --> 00:21:26,785
No, that's not what I meant.

272
00:21:26,868 --> 00:21:28,578
I know what you meant.

273
00:21:33,125 --> 00:21:37,671
It feels like the fire
is actually warming us up, doesn't it?

274
00:22:25,635 --> 00:22:26,470
No way.

275
00:22:35,729 --> 00:22:37,814
Is this a dream?

276
00:22:37,898 --> 00:22:38,815
Yes.

277
00:22:40,567 --> 00:22:41,610
Are you up?

278
00:22:42,277 --> 00:22:45,280
Your body temperature is rising.
Do you think you've caught a cold?

279
00:22:48,241 --> 00:22:50,410
No, I'm good.

280
00:22:52,204 --> 00:22:53,997
Gosh, I really feel cold now.

281
00:22:54,081 --> 00:22:55,707
I'm heading back inside.

282
00:23:01,713 --> 00:23:03,757
This is nice.

283
00:23:07,427 --> 00:23:08,387
What?

284
00:23:08,970 --> 00:23:10,847
Don't you like chicken feet?

285
00:23:11,473 --> 00:23:12,557
They're delicious.

286
00:23:16,520 --> 00:23:17,562
I'm sorry...

287
00:23:18,647 --> 00:23:19,648
about before.

288
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:21,441
The president...

289
00:23:21,900 --> 00:23:23,944
I mean, my father kept pushing.

290
00:23:24,027 --> 00:23:26,321
Still, you were against it

291
00:23:26,405 --> 00:23:28,031
and informed me in advance.

292
00:23:30,409 --> 00:23:31,618
Because we're friends.

293
00:23:36,081 --> 00:23:36,957
Cheers.

294
00:23:44,214 --> 00:23:47,217
I heard your brother's arrest
was quickly solved.

295
00:23:50,011 --> 00:23:51,304
Actually,

296
00:23:51,888 --> 00:23:53,723
he's not my biological brother.

297
00:23:54,057 --> 00:23:56,393
If he was,
I wouldn't be moping here like this.

298
00:23:56,476 --> 00:23:59,187
I would've given him a good punch.

299
00:24:00,105 --> 00:24:03,900
At first, I felt so bad for him.

300
00:24:04,401 --> 00:24:06,153
I wanted to help him any way I could.

301
00:24:07,028 --> 00:24:09,990
Shoot. Before I knew it, though,

302
00:24:11,158 --> 00:24:15,328
I had to be the face of a company,
which isn't like me at all.

303
00:24:16,496 --> 00:24:20,709
So you're upset because your brother
isn't aware of the stress you're under.

304
00:24:20,792 --> 00:24:23,545
That's right. Darn it.

305
00:24:27,841 --> 00:24:32,345
Anyway, is this really that good?
Isn't it a bit grotesque?

306
00:24:32,429 --> 00:24:33,889
Oh, I see.

307
00:24:34,598 --> 00:24:36,475
You can't eat chicken feet.

308
00:24:41,354 --> 00:24:42,272
As if.

309
00:24:42,355 --> 00:24:43,523
Here you go, then.

310
00:24:43,607 --> 00:24:44,608
I'll eat it, then.

311
00:24:44,691 --> 00:24:46,026
They're cute.

312
00:24:55,577 --> 00:24:56,953
Tasty, right?

313
00:24:59,664 --> 00:25:01,666
Gosh, look at your face!

314
00:25:04,503 --> 00:25:06,087
You can't eat it, can you?

315
00:25:07,047 --> 00:25:08,924
Why? What is it?

316
00:25:10,509 --> 00:25:12,636
PRESIDENT BAEK

317
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:23,188
What have you been up to?

318
00:25:26,024 --> 00:25:28,527
I've been handling my mess as you ordered.

319
00:25:32,364 --> 00:25:35,867
This guy is a known agent
in the underground scene these days.

320
00:25:35,951 --> 00:25:39,955
-I've requested a few workers.
-What do you mean by workers?

321
00:25:43,875 --> 00:25:47,003
We've tried a direct attack
on the server, but to no avail.

322
00:25:47,087 --> 00:25:50,173
In terms of security measures,
GIO Lab is impenetrable.

323
00:25:50,257 --> 00:25:52,008
Without the prototype--

324
00:25:52,092 --> 00:25:53,718
It depends on who does it.

325
00:25:53,802 --> 00:25:57,889
I spent quite a lot of money gathering
those with Interpol Red Notices.

326
00:25:57,973 --> 00:26:01,726
They have the talent to hack into it
without the glasses.

327
00:26:01,810 --> 00:26:04,854
Working with high-profile criminals
will make it difficult for us--

328
00:26:05,355 --> 00:26:07,440
Your job
is to take care of the consequences.

329
00:26:09,901 --> 00:26:13,905
If we don't pull this off,
our company will crumble anyway.

330
00:26:15,365 --> 00:26:19,703
Wouldn't you rather be dishonest
and survive than be dignified and crumble?

331
00:26:45,645 --> 00:26:46,896
Did you sleep well?

332
00:26:53,778 --> 00:26:55,030
You look flushed.

333
00:26:55,822 --> 00:26:57,324
Maybe you have a cold.

334
00:26:58,992 --> 00:27:01,328
I don't. It's just...

335
00:27:02,370 --> 00:27:06,708
Actually, maybe I do.
I should probably bundle up today, right?

336
00:27:06,791 --> 00:27:08,627
Gosh, it's cold.

337
00:27:30,357 --> 00:27:31,983
Miss Han!

338
00:27:32,734 --> 00:27:34,944
-Good morning, Miss Han.
-Right.

339
00:27:35,028 --> 00:27:37,322
I only came in for some A4-sized paper.

340
00:27:37,405 --> 00:27:40,575
-Oh, A4-sized paper...
-Right, there's a lot of it in here.

341
00:27:40,659 --> 00:27:41,743
Here you go.

342
00:27:41,826 --> 00:27:44,287
Well, Ji-hye has such pretty eyes that...

343
00:27:44,371 --> 00:27:46,873
I mean, something was in her eye, so I...

344
00:27:46,956 --> 00:27:49,292
Anyway, here you go.

345
00:27:49,376 --> 00:27:50,627
Miss Han, wait.

346
00:27:51,211 --> 00:27:53,880
Could you pretend
that you didn't see anything?

347
00:27:53,963 --> 00:27:54,881
Keep it a secret?

348
00:27:58,968 --> 00:28:00,637
Sure. Of course.

349
00:28:02,389 --> 00:28:03,598
You're the best.

350
00:28:04,265 --> 00:28:05,100
Right.

351
00:28:11,356 --> 00:28:15,068
Here's the expanded marketing plan
regarding Prism's TV advertisement.

352
00:28:15,151 --> 00:28:17,737
I'd like to mention its direction first.

353
00:28:17,821 --> 00:28:21,282
In order to catch the viewers' attention,

354
00:28:21,366 --> 00:28:24,285
I thought it'd be best to promote it
with a TV drama series

355
00:28:24,369 --> 00:28:26,162
with a K-pop idol singer as its lead.

356
00:28:26,246 --> 00:28:29,708
By positioning our main products,
we can expose...

357
00:28:29,791 --> 00:28:33,795
Ji-hye, just one thing.
When handing in a draft...

358
00:28:57,110 --> 00:28:58,319
Since when?

359
00:28:59,571 --> 00:29:02,323
-Did everyone else know?
-I didn't know either.

360
00:29:02,907 --> 00:29:06,286
Now that I know, it seems obvious.
They must be in love.

361
00:29:06,786 --> 00:29:07,954
Right.

362
00:29:13,835 --> 00:29:15,253
-What's wrong?
-What?

363
00:29:16,296 --> 00:29:17,630
Oh, it's nothing.

364
00:29:17,714 --> 00:29:19,424
What the hell am I imagining?

365
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:24,971
-Hi, Mom.
-Where are you? I brought side dishes.

366
00:29:25,054 --> 00:29:28,767
Yoo-ram's home today,
so let's have dinner together.

367
00:29:28,850 --> 00:29:29,684
Sure.

368
00:29:31,019 --> 00:29:32,979
Gosh, this looks delicious!

369
00:29:33,062 --> 00:29:35,398
You didn't have to cook so much, you know.

370
00:29:35,482 --> 00:29:37,066
It's a lot, isn't it?

371
00:29:37,859 --> 00:29:40,445
-Why don't we invite your neighbor?
-Yes, let's.

372
00:29:40,528 --> 00:29:42,405
He has a cold. A severe one too.

373
00:29:42,489 --> 00:29:44,491
Then shouldn't you nurse him
back to health

374
00:29:44,574 --> 00:29:46,201
-or something?
-Why should I?

375
00:29:47,368 --> 00:29:49,829
Playing dumb, are we?

376
00:29:50,413 --> 00:29:53,374
I'm sure they'll get closer
when the time is right.

377
00:29:55,376 --> 00:29:57,712
Anyway, what was his name again?

378
00:29:57,796 --> 00:29:58,922
Seriously?

379
00:29:59,005 --> 00:30:00,965
Why do you keep asking for him?

380
00:30:01,049 --> 00:30:02,509
Well, isn't it obvious?

381
00:30:02,592 --> 00:30:05,929
He carried me to the hospital,
so I'm grateful.

382
00:30:06,137 --> 00:30:07,597
-I don't know.
-What?

383
00:30:10,600 --> 00:30:12,101
I really don't know.

384
00:30:12,185 --> 00:30:16,147
I asked, but he didn't answer,
so I saved his number under "Next Door."

385
00:30:19,150 --> 00:30:21,152
Jeez, whatever.

386
00:30:23,696 --> 00:30:25,156
There's no need to see me out.

387
00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:27,784
Bring him some porridge
and side dishes with it.

388
00:30:27,867 --> 00:30:30,370
-There's no need for that.
-Just do as you're told.

389
00:30:30,954 --> 00:30:33,456
There's nothing sadder than being alone
while sick.

390
00:30:33,540 --> 00:30:35,750
-All right.
-Yoo-ram...

391
00:30:37,377 --> 00:30:38,920
-I'll get going.
-Bye.

392
00:30:39,003 --> 00:30:40,171
Bye, Mom.

393
00:30:43,424 --> 00:30:44,300
Come on.

394
00:30:44,384 --> 00:30:46,511
-So, when did it begin?
-What?

395
00:30:46,594 --> 00:30:47,679
How did you meet him?

396
00:30:47,762 --> 00:30:51,015
-Who?
-Your mom told me everything.

397
00:30:51,641 --> 00:30:54,227
-You're seeing someone.
-Oh, right, that.

398
00:30:54,310 --> 00:30:57,105
Well... it just happened, all right?

399
00:30:57,188 --> 00:31:00,859
I see.
What about him did you find so charming?

400
00:31:01,276 --> 00:31:03,361
You know...

401
00:31:03,444 --> 00:31:08,283
Well, he's kind and generous,
and he adores me.

402
00:31:08,575 --> 00:31:10,201
Gosh, look at you.

403
00:31:11,077 --> 00:31:12,704
So... have you done it?

404
00:31:13,246 --> 00:31:17,333
-What the hell? Seriously?
-So, you haven't done it yet.

405
00:31:20,795 --> 00:31:25,717
-Is he a good kisser?
-Oh, that. Well...

406
00:31:25,800 --> 00:31:29,262
Wait, you haven't even kissed yet?

407
00:31:29,345 --> 00:31:31,598
Is there something wrong with you?

408
00:31:32,307 --> 00:31:33,850
Or maybe he's the problem.

409
00:31:33,933 --> 00:31:37,896
Not all relationships
are about physical contact, you know.

410
00:31:38,229 --> 00:31:41,399
What the hell are you talking about?
Relationships aren't much.

411
00:31:41,482 --> 00:31:44,652
Sparks fly when you see each other,

412
00:31:44,736 --> 00:31:47,655
your heart races,
and you want to be physically closer.

413
00:31:48,114 --> 00:31:49,657
That's how it normally is.

414
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:00,293
It's not.

415
00:32:07,050 --> 00:32:09,052
-See if it's seasoned properly.
-Okay.

416
00:32:11,137 --> 00:32:13,264
-I'm stepping out.
-Where?

417
00:32:13,681 --> 00:32:15,475
To kiss someone, gosh.

418
00:32:15,558 --> 00:32:17,810
What? She's unbelievable.

419
00:32:19,896 --> 00:32:22,190
You know,
about what Yoo-ram said earlier--

420
00:32:22,273 --> 00:32:27,111
Oh, that? She was just spewing nonsense.
It's really nothing to worry about.

421
00:32:27,487 --> 00:32:29,197
The pot will burn at this rate!

422
00:32:30,365 --> 00:32:31,491
Gosh, it's hot.

423
00:32:39,874 --> 00:32:41,709
HOLO

424
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:43,294
MISSED CALL
HOLO

425
00:32:44,879 --> 00:32:47,966
Are you home?
So-yeon will bring over some porridge.

426
00:32:56,099 --> 00:32:58,559
-Maybe he's too sick to get up?
-He could be out.

427
00:33:00,812 --> 00:33:03,690
-The door's open. Maybe he stepped out.
-Are you going to go in?

428
00:33:07,902 --> 00:33:09,946
Well, I'll leave this
and come straight out.

429
00:33:10,530 --> 00:33:12,073
Excuse me. I'm coming in.

430
00:33:18,496 --> 00:33:20,373
Where should I leave this?

431
00:33:30,466 --> 00:33:31,384
What?

432
00:33:33,386 --> 00:33:35,596
-What?
-What, no!

433
00:33:37,098 --> 00:33:39,100
-Oh, no!
-My gosh. Shoot!

434
00:33:57,827 --> 00:33:59,245
Did you see him?

435
00:34:00,955 --> 00:34:01,914
Yes.

436
00:34:02,790 --> 00:34:04,333
Yes, I saw his face.

437
00:34:05,752 --> 00:34:07,712
My mind must be so deep in the gutter

438
00:34:07,795 --> 00:34:09,797
for me to see your face
overlapping with his.

439
00:34:09,881 --> 00:34:13,092
"Deep in the gutter"?
My face overlapped with his?

440
00:34:18,097 --> 00:34:21,309
What? No. That's not it.

441
00:34:21,976 --> 00:34:25,188
Your heart is beating
way above your average rate.

442
00:34:30,234 --> 00:34:33,780
Oh, well, I was just startled...

443
00:34:33,863 --> 00:34:34,739
-Shoot!
-Careful!

444
00:34:34,822 --> 00:34:37,909
What now? She must have seen my face.

445
00:34:38,534 --> 00:34:40,203
I'm sure she saw it.

446
00:34:40,745 --> 00:34:42,038
What do I do?

447
00:34:43,539 --> 00:34:44,624
Shit.

448
00:34:50,046 --> 00:34:51,047
All right.

449
00:34:51,881 --> 00:34:53,216
It's spilled milk now.

450
00:34:54,801 --> 00:34:57,220
-I'll...
-There's no need to worry.

451
00:34:58,888 --> 00:35:01,516
Fortunately,
she thinks she was imagining it.

452
00:35:04,894 --> 00:35:06,104
-Really?
-Yes.

453
00:35:06,521 --> 00:35:08,606
She was quite flustered anyway.

454
00:35:15,404 --> 00:35:16,489
So...

455
00:35:17,406 --> 00:35:21,202
she's been wanting a certain something
that you can't provide?

456
00:35:21,285 --> 00:35:22,578
Physical contact.

457
00:35:22,662 --> 00:35:23,788
Unbelievable.

458
00:35:23,871 --> 00:35:26,541
Am I supposed to be relieved about this?

459
00:35:26,624 --> 00:35:29,418
I envy you. At least you have a body.

460
00:35:29,877 --> 00:35:33,047
Oh, this must be what jealousy feels like.

461
00:35:33,131 --> 00:35:35,842
Enough with the nonsense.
Go on a date someplace nice. Bye.

462
00:35:35,925 --> 00:35:37,426
I'm jealous.

463
00:35:45,685 --> 00:35:49,522
My mom suggested that I bring food over.
I'm terribly sorry.

464
00:36:07,123 --> 00:36:08,457
Were you up all night?

465
00:36:09,375 --> 00:36:10,626
Thank you.

466
00:36:10,877 --> 00:36:13,546
And yes. Did you look into it?

467
00:36:13,629 --> 00:36:17,175
His unmarried mother
was a rising researcher in AI.

468
00:36:18,009 --> 00:36:21,637
For reasons unknown,
she committed suicide when he was little.

469
00:36:23,639 --> 00:36:26,517
Here's the file on her death,
but nothing stands out.

470
00:36:27,226 --> 00:36:31,105
-Did you get some useful information?
-This case gets more and more confusing.

471
00:36:31,856 --> 00:36:35,067
No matter how much I look into it,
it's just as he said.

472
00:36:35,151 --> 00:36:38,821
In that situation,
no human could've possibly...

473
00:36:43,326 --> 00:36:45,077
Okay, this might sound like nonsense,

474
00:36:46,204 --> 00:36:48,789
but what if... it wasn't a human being?

475
00:36:50,082 --> 00:36:52,960
Are you suggesting
that an AI hacked the system?

476
00:36:53,252 --> 00:36:57,548
I hear that the AI technology
developed by GIO Lab is quite advanced,

477
00:36:57,632 --> 00:36:59,217
but that's a whole different level.

478
00:36:59,300 --> 00:37:01,636
Also, how do you explain
the case from 12 years ago?

479
00:37:01,719 --> 00:37:03,638
I doubt the AI existed back then.

480
00:37:06,140 --> 00:37:07,892
What if Ko Nan-do...

481
00:37:09,227 --> 00:37:11,520
kept working on the AI project

482
00:37:11,604 --> 00:37:14,357
that his mother first began?

483
00:37:17,276 --> 00:37:20,446
And what if it has been conducting
deep learning ever since?

484
00:37:20,529 --> 00:37:22,615
Then it could be somewhat possible.

485
00:37:22,698 --> 00:37:26,035
If he's truly the mastermind
behind an advanced AI,

486
00:37:26,535 --> 00:37:28,955
why isn't he at his office working on it

487
00:37:29,455 --> 00:37:32,208
and lurking
around that Han So-yeon instead?

488
00:37:34,919 --> 00:37:36,754
He may be doing so.

489
00:37:36,837 --> 00:37:37,713
Sorry?

490
00:37:37,797 --> 00:37:40,967
Have you heard about the delay
with his new product launch?

491
00:37:41,050 --> 00:37:44,136
It's due to some beta test,
but I'm not sure.

492
00:37:47,682 --> 00:37:50,893
She must be the tester.
The AI must be in her possession.

493
00:38:55,708 --> 00:38:56,709
Excuse me.

494
00:39:07,970 --> 00:39:10,431
-How about some music?
-Sure.

495
00:39:27,406 --> 00:39:28,824
Two adults, please.

496
00:39:29,492 --> 00:39:30,493
Two?

497
00:39:30,659 --> 00:39:32,453
Yes, one for you, one for me.

498
00:39:32,620 --> 00:39:34,413
Let's take a selfie later on.

499
00:39:55,518 --> 00:39:56,560
What's wrong?

500
00:39:57,686 --> 00:39:59,647
It's nothing. Shall we go inside?

501
00:40:21,585 --> 00:40:24,463
She doesn't seem to have
anything out of the ordinary.

502
00:40:24,547 --> 00:40:26,757
Her phone's not a special type either.

503
00:40:26,841 --> 00:40:29,593
No, I'm sure of it.
I'm sure she has something.

504
00:40:29,927 --> 00:40:30,803
Follow her.

505
00:40:32,346 --> 00:40:33,222
What's this?

506
00:40:33,681 --> 00:40:35,099
Tillandsia.

507
00:40:35,182 --> 00:40:37,393
It's a pineapple
that originated in Mexico.

508
00:40:37,476 --> 00:40:40,604
It's known to grow in dry regions
450 to 1,700 meters above sea level.

509
00:40:40,688 --> 00:40:43,482
Its flower symbolizes everlasting love.

510
00:40:49,822 --> 00:40:50,865
What about this?

511
00:40:52,283 --> 00:40:53,784
Oh, this.

512
00:41:02,710 --> 00:41:04,879
What is it?
Is it something even you don't know?

513
00:41:05,880 --> 00:41:08,132
It's a camellia tree.
Why don't we go that way?

514
00:41:08,215 --> 00:41:09,675
I'm not done, though.

515
00:41:09,758 --> 00:41:10,718
Hurry.

516
00:41:11,469 --> 00:41:13,012
-Gosh.
-Seriously?

517
00:41:13,095 --> 00:41:15,806
You made an AI that can feel love.

518
00:41:15,890 --> 00:41:18,392
Why would you omit that feature
when you launch?

519
00:41:18,476 --> 00:41:21,145
-Why not?
-Were you excited about getting an AI girl

520
00:41:21,228 --> 00:41:23,314
-to love you?
-What? That's...

521
00:41:23,397 --> 00:41:25,691
Jeez, what do you take me for?

522
00:41:25,774 --> 00:41:28,736
I'm not opposing your suggestion
for personal reasons.

523
00:41:28,819 --> 00:41:32,323
This invention will bring happiness
to mankind

524
00:41:32,406 --> 00:41:35,868
and is worthy of a Nobel Peace Prize
for what it can do for world peace--

525
00:41:35,951 --> 00:41:37,203
Fine, that's enough.

526
00:41:38,787 --> 00:41:39,705
What's up?

527
00:41:40,539 --> 00:41:43,584
What? The police are tailing So-yeon?

528
00:41:45,085 --> 00:41:47,588
Shoot. I'll be right there.

529
00:41:47,671 --> 00:41:50,716
Don't interact with her anymore.
They might find it suspicious.

530
00:41:50,799 --> 00:41:52,885
Is it me the police are after?

531
00:41:52,968 --> 00:41:55,513
Don't let them find out about you,
all right?

532
00:41:57,097 --> 00:41:59,308
Holo, does this tree produce flowers?

533
00:42:01,018 --> 00:42:02,645
Are you seeing this? Look at her.

534
00:42:03,270 --> 00:42:07,191
-She's talking to someone invisible.
-She could be talking to herself.

535
00:42:08,234 --> 00:42:10,027
People who live alone tend to do that.

536
00:42:10,110 --> 00:42:11,654
I guess that could be it, but...

537
00:42:12,446 --> 00:42:16,909
What if she's communicating
with the AI through some sort of device?

538
00:42:17,826 --> 00:42:18,869
Her phone?

539
00:42:20,204 --> 00:42:21,664
No, an in-ear device?

540
00:42:22,748 --> 00:42:23,666
Her glasses?

541
00:42:24,166 --> 00:42:25,709
-Gosh, I'm sorry.
-Oh, it's fine.

542
00:42:33,259 --> 00:42:35,010
Mr. Next Door, what's up?

543
00:42:35,094 --> 00:42:37,721
You said you'd buy me a meal,
but you haven't called.

544
00:42:37,805 --> 00:42:39,890
Fine, I'll buy. When are you free?

545
00:42:39,974 --> 00:42:40,933
Right now!

546
00:42:43,602 --> 00:42:45,187
I'm quite busy right now, so--

547
00:42:45,271 --> 00:42:47,022
See? I knew you didn't mean it.

548
00:42:47,106 --> 00:42:48,232
That's not true.

549
00:42:48,399 --> 00:42:50,568
Set a date and time, and I'll buy.

550
00:42:50,651 --> 00:42:53,362
What should we eat? What do you prefer?

551
00:42:53,445 --> 00:42:56,073
Korean, Chinese, Western, or Japanese?

552
00:42:56,156 --> 00:42:57,866
Choose already. I'm starving!

553
00:42:58,534 --> 00:43:01,120
I'm fine with whatever,
so choose whatever you want.

554
00:43:01,203 --> 00:43:04,123
Anyway, I'm on a date right now,
so let's talk later.

555
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:07,876
Oh, she was just on the phone.

556
00:43:08,252 --> 00:43:09,295
That's weird.

557
00:43:16,760 --> 00:43:18,554
Why are you in such a hurry?

558
00:43:19,346 --> 00:43:20,514
Hey, wait for me!

559
00:43:22,933 --> 00:43:23,976
Wait!

560
00:43:25,477 --> 00:43:27,187
Hold up!

561
00:43:27,271 --> 00:43:29,231
Why are you in a rush?

562
00:43:29,315 --> 00:43:31,400
I couldn't get a proper look
because of you.

563
00:43:31,775 --> 00:43:34,153
There's a better spot over there. Come on.

564
00:43:34,778 --> 00:43:37,823
What? Darn it.

565
00:43:48,500 --> 00:43:50,294
So-yeon.

566
00:43:50,961 --> 00:43:52,087
Over here.

567
00:43:55,257 --> 00:43:56,967
Wait, why did you change clothes?

568
00:43:57,051 --> 00:44:00,387
You said before
that I'd look nice in achromatic colors.

569
00:44:00,471 --> 00:44:01,555
It just came to mind.

570
00:44:15,194 --> 00:44:16,570
Well, it does suit you.

571
00:44:16,862 --> 00:44:19,948
-Come on.
-Can't we slow down for a bit?

572
00:44:20,032 --> 00:44:22,076
From what I can tell, Han So-yeon

573
00:44:22,201 --> 00:44:24,995
doesn't have an AI device
but the AI developer.

574
00:44:28,374 --> 00:44:31,752
Wait, what's this flower?
I've seen it around everywhere.

575
00:44:31,835 --> 00:44:33,545
-This?
-Yes.

576
00:44:34,129 --> 00:44:36,840
Azalea? No, rhododendron...

577
00:44:38,342 --> 00:44:39,885
It's just a pink flower.

578
00:44:41,261 --> 00:44:42,638
-What?
-Why?

579
00:44:42,721 --> 00:44:44,890
You just seem different, that's all.

580
00:44:45,432 --> 00:44:47,476
Actually, that's not it.

581
00:44:51,438 --> 00:44:52,898
Maybe it's because we're here.

582
00:44:58,362 --> 00:44:59,947
Come on, let's enjoy the weather.

583
00:45:06,412 --> 00:45:08,414
I think that's enough.

584
00:45:08,497 --> 00:45:10,416
Why tail others on a date?

585
00:45:11,041 --> 00:45:13,335
Han So-yeon only got mixed up in this

586
00:45:13,919 --> 00:45:15,671
because she's dating Ko Nan-do.

587
00:45:19,925 --> 00:45:22,428
I think the fireworks
will start soon here.

588
00:45:37,401 --> 00:45:40,446
The police are gone.
Let's switch back when we can.

589
00:45:45,242 --> 00:45:47,995
-Oh, I see it.
-Gosh, it's so pretty.

590
00:45:48,078 --> 00:45:49,747
-Wow.
-We should take a photo.

591
00:45:49,830 --> 00:45:50,664
Here it comes.

592
00:45:50,748 --> 00:45:51,790
-It's going up.
-No way.

593
00:45:51,874 --> 00:45:53,792
Look how pretty it is.

594
00:45:53,959 --> 00:45:55,294
Look at that.

595
00:45:56,545 --> 00:45:58,130
Isn't it beautiful?

596
00:46:04,803 --> 00:46:05,679
You're right.

597
00:46:07,598 --> 00:46:09,266
Aren't you glad we came?

598
00:46:14,271 --> 00:46:15,981
-My gosh, it's so amazing.
-How nice.

599
00:46:19,902 --> 00:46:20,778
That's amazing.

600
00:46:41,799 --> 00:46:42,966
That's odd.

601
00:46:43,383 --> 00:46:44,885
I feel like I can touch you...

602
00:46:47,262 --> 00:46:48,514
if I just reach forward.

603
00:46:55,437 --> 00:46:56,688
Is this a dream?

604
00:47:18,919 --> 00:47:21,171
Gosh, look at that!

605
00:47:21,255 --> 00:47:23,173
Wasn't that amazing?

606
00:47:23,841 --> 00:47:24,842
It was.

607
00:47:27,761 --> 00:47:29,221
It's so nice.

608
00:47:30,514 --> 00:47:32,140
-I...
-It's beautiful.

609
00:47:33,183 --> 00:47:34,726
Did you see that?

610
00:47:39,731 --> 00:47:41,233
How can it be this spectacular?

611
00:47:41,316 --> 00:47:42,693
Could it be any prettier?

612
00:47:42,776 --> 00:47:45,320
-Yes?
-We're in trouble. Where are you?

613
00:48:12,097 --> 00:48:13,473
I'm sorry.

614
00:48:14,850 --> 00:48:15,809
But...

615
00:48:17,227 --> 00:48:18,437
I keep wanting more.

616
00:48:20,188 --> 00:48:21,565
I love you,

617
00:48:21,940 --> 00:48:24,776
and I've been trying to believe
that you're real.

618
00:48:27,654 --> 00:48:29,072
But the more I do that,

619
00:48:30,282 --> 00:48:34,161
the more I want you to be
a real human being.

620
00:48:40,918 --> 00:48:42,044
Am I...

621
00:48:42,920 --> 00:48:44,046
a fake, then?

622
00:48:46,506 --> 00:48:47,925
That's not what I mean.

623
00:49:01,980 --> 00:49:03,273
Holo?

624
00:49:09,363 --> 00:49:10,530
Holo!

625
00:49:19,164 --> 00:49:20,165
What happened?

626
00:49:20,248 --> 00:49:22,751
We're being hacked? Are they through?

627
00:49:22,834 --> 00:49:25,796
I'm trying to block them, but it's bad.

628
00:49:25,879 --> 00:49:26,838
Move.

629
00:49:30,342 --> 00:49:32,928
I don't care who they are,
they won't get through.

630
00:49:33,011 --> 00:49:34,054
How so?

631
00:49:36,264 --> 00:49:37,724
I'll stop them.

632
00:49:41,895 --> 00:49:42,854
What?

633
00:49:43,355 --> 00:49:46,441
You incompetent fools!
Get back here right now!

634
00:50:02,124 --> 00:50:04,459
I think we were able to block the attack.

635
00:50:09,172 --> 00:50:11,717
What's the damage rate
of the main server data?

636
00:50:12,426 --> 00:50:13,969
It's 57.4 percent.

637
00:50:14,052 --> 00:50:17,889
They didn't manage to steal Holo,
but our system has been shattered.

638
00:50:17,973 --> 00:50:19,808
It's hard to tell how long it'll take

639
00:50:19,891 --> 00:50:21,810
to restore it
and whether it's possible--

640
00:50:21,893 --> 00:50:24,813
I don't care how long it takes
or how we do it. We'll restore it.

641
00:50:25,230 --> 00:50:26,314
Yes, Boss.

642
00:50:32,779 --> 00:50:34,322
Han So-yeon...

643
00:50:35,365 --> 00:50:38,410
will be in danger if anyone
tries to get the glasses,

644
00:50:38,827 --> 00:50:40,787
-so I'll retrieve them.
-Sure.

645
00:50:42,039 --> 00:50:42,914
You should.

646
00:50:45,459 --> 00:50:46,877
FIREWORK FESTIVAL

647
00:51:03,727 --> 00:51:06,396
I know this will sound weird,

648
00:51:07,064 --> 00:51:09,775
but I can't think of
anyone else to ask this.

649
00:51:10,984 --> 00:51:14,196
Can an AI feel pain and get heartbroken?

650
00:51:21,787 --> 00:51:23,955
CAN AN AI FEEL PAIN AND GET HEARTBROKEN?

651
00:51:29,669 --> 00:51:34,257
It's possible, right?
And can it make the AI break down?

652
00:51:35,759 --> 00:51:38,553
What's wrong? Did you swear
at your robot vacuum cleaner?

653
00:51:38,637 --> 00:51:40,305
Has it stopped moving?

654
00:51:40,889 --> 00:51:42,307
No, it's not like that.

655
00:51:42,390 --> 00:51:44,017
I'm sure it's a technical issue.

656
00:51:44,101 --> 00:51:47,521
The manufacturer will fix it,
so don't worry too much.

657
00:51:55,612 --> 00:51:57,197
Also, don't blame yourself.

658
00:51:57,739 --> 00:51:59,116
It's not your fault.

659
00:52:07,874 --> 00:52:08,792
Miss Han?

660
00:52:16,383 --> 00:52:18,051
-Do I know you?
-I'm Ko Yoo-jin,

661
00:52:18,135 --> 00:52:20,345
the founder of GIO Lab
and creator of Holo.

662
00:52:20,470 --> 00:52:23,098
Thank you for participating
in our beta test.

663
00:52:23,181 --> 00:52:25,976
-I'm here to retrieve the glasses.
-What about Holo?

664
00:52:26,059 --> 00:52:29,437
-Where is he?
-A temporary error occurred.

665
00:52:29,521 --> 00:52:32,357
All I can tell you
is that we're trying to fix it.

666
00:52:33,400 --> 00:52:34,526
It's my fault.

667
00:52:35,026 --> 00:52:37,154
Actually, it was due to a hack.

668
00:52:37,779 --> 00:52:42,159
If you are in possession of the glasses,
those after Holo might hunt you down.

669
00:52:42,784 --> 00:52:44,244
So the glasses...

670
00:52:45,579 --> 00:52:46,788
Lead the way.

671
00:52:47,497 --> 00:52:49,583
-Sorry?
-I'll come with you.

672
00:52:49,666 --> 00:52:50,750
But that's...

673
00:52:54,421 --> 00:52:57,465
I'll give you the glasses,
so let me meet Holo.

674
00:52:59,676 --> 00:53:02,345
I'd like to meet him once more...

675
00:53:03,847 --> 00:53:05,807
and tell him I'm sorry.

676
00:53:10,020 --> 00:53:13,690
At least let me say goodbye to him.

677
00:53:15,483 --> 00:53:18,278
I won't hand over the glasses until I do.

678
00:55:10,724 --> 00:55:12,559
