1
00:00:49,466 --> 00:00:50,467
Activate Admin Mode.

2
00:00:53,386 --> 00:00:54,304
And the device?

3
00:00:57,057 --> 00:00:58,099
We're good.

4
00:01:01,311 --> 00:01:05,815
Holo, why didn't you report your location?
I looked for you everywhere.

5
00:01:05,899 --> 00:01:08,526
I was being chased.
I didn't want to lead them to you.

6
00:01:08,610 --> 00:01:10,945
-Let's do a thorough checkup.
-Hold on.

7
00:01:13,865 --> 00:01:15,950
I'd like to be with her a bit longer.

8
00:01:16,451 --> 00:01:18,369
-Can I?
-What?

9
00:01:20,371 --> 00:01:22,332
-Why do you want to do that?
-For no reason.

10
00:01:24,334 --> 00:01:25,376
"For no reason"?

11
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:28,880
-Did you just say, "For no reason"?
-Yes.

12
00:01:29,881 --> 00:01:31,007
You're a holographic AI.

13
00:01:31,424 --> 00:01:34,677
Humans may not have reasons
for their actions, but you should.

14
00:01:34,761 --> 00:01:37,764
-This is a serious problem.
-Is that so?

15
00:01:38,515 --> 00:01:41,017
I'm only trying to follow the three rules.

16
00:01:41,518 --> 00:01:44,437
I said I'd help her to not feel lonely.
If I disappear now,

17
00:01:45,146 --> 00:01:47,607
-that would mean I lied.
-Why would you promise that?

18
00:01:49,609 --> 00:01:51,486
Being with her has changed you.

19
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:53,780
Holo, you...

20
00:01:57,408 --> 00:02:01,788
I have to say,
you truly seem like a human being.

21
00:02:01,913 --> 00:02:04,082
Here. Look at your eyes...

22
00:02:05,667 --> 00:02:07,085
and your nose.

23
00:02:09,504 --> 00:02:11,214
Even your lips look so human.

24
00:02:38,825 --> 00:02:40,160
Who the hell are you?

25
00:02:41,870 --> 00:02:43,288
When did you get here?

26
00:02:43,371 --> 00:02:44,289
Damn it.

27
00:02:48,209 --> 00:02:50,461
Gosh. You thief!

28
00:02:52,380 --> 00:02:53,882
Damn it!

29
00:02:53,965 --> 00:02:55,175
Somebody, help!

30
00:03:07,228 --> 00:03:09,022
Hold on. We should talk.

31
00:03:09,105 --> 00:03:11,232
-He's insane.
-No, wait.

32
00:03:12,025 --> 00:03:12,859
Damn.

33
00:03:14,152 --> 00:03:15,945
Why are you following me?

34
00:03:16,696 --> 00:03:18,323
Wait. It's not like that.

35
00:03:19,741 --> 00:03:20,658
Hold on.

36
00:03:22,368 --> 00:03:24,704
Just look at me!
Can't you tell what's going on?

37
00:03:24,787 --> 00:03:26,789
-What?
-Look.

38
00:03:27,999 --> 00:03:33,213
-Look. Here, look. Look at me.
-What the hell?

39
00:03:33,713 --> 00:03:36,716
Don't just stand there.
Take a closer look.

40
00:03:37,258 --> 00:03:38,968
Whatever! I don't care!

41
00:03:39,052 --> 00:03:40,136
Damn it.

42
00:03:43,264 --> 00:03:46,976
Hey, over there. Excuse me!

43
00:03:47,769 --> 00:03:49,938
-Darn.
-Over there...

44
00:03:50,855 --> 00:03:51,689
What?

45
00:03:51,773 --> 00:03:53,274
Can we help you?

46
00:03:53,358 --> 00:03:56,236
Well, I fell asleep
on the rooftop of my house.

47
00:03:56,319 --> 00:03:57,153
I see.

48
00:03:57,237 --> 00:04:00,240
I woke up, and there was a guy next to me.

49
00:04:00,323 --> 00:04:02,575
And then our lips touched.

50
00:04:02,659 --> 00:04:04,077
I don't even know the guy,

51
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:07,080
but he kept following me
and asking me if I recognized him.

52
00:04:07,163 --> 00:04:08,539
There's no one out here.

53
00:04:09,749 --> 00:04:12,585
Looks like you had a few drinks.

54
00:04:12,794 --> 00:04:15,171
Where do you live? We'll escort you home.

55
00:04:15,255 --> 00:04:17,840
But...

56
00:04:19,509 --> 00:04:21,594
Damn it!

57
00:04:25,765 --> 00:04:27,684
Who does she think she is?

58
00:04:32,188 --> 00:04:34,107
GIO Lab is a leader of the Third...

59
00:04:34,774 --> 00:04:37,151
Fourth Industrial Revolution

60
00:04:37,235 --> 00:04:39,988
and plans to take a step forward
into the world

61
00:04:40,071 --> 00:04:42,448
through investment control
of global IT companies.

62
00:04:42,532 --> 00:04:44,617
Especially the IOT products...

63
00:04:44,784 --> 00:04:47,704
We seek to launch
a more advanced wearable device

64
00:04:47,787 --> 00:04:48,621
based on AI--

65
00:04:51,499 --> 00:04:54,752
I can never get used to the jargon.
Can't they use easier words?

66
00:04:55,878 --> 00:04:57,714
Just memorize your script.

67
00:04:58,006 --> 00:05:00,591
People will suspect you
if you get the jargon wrong.

68
00:05:00,675 --> 00:05:02,969
The real problem
is that the script is boring.

69
00:05:03,052 --> 00:05:05,430
Why can't genius CEOs
be in a relationship?

70
00:05:05,513 --> 00:05:08,433
How about a romantic-- My gosh, Nan-do!

71
00:05:19,694 --> 00:05:21,904
How could you not visit me once
at the hospital

72
00:05:21,988 --> 00:05:23,614
when I got injured protecting Holo?

73
00:05:23,698 --> 00:05:25,950
I can tell you're fine
from your loud voice.

74
00:05:26,034 --> 00:05:30,872
Jeez. You're one coldhearted man.
Can't you be half as nice as Holo?

75
00:05:30,955 --> 00:05:35,168
Whatever human traits it has,
it came from my programming.

76
00:05:35,251 --> 00:05:36,127
Jeez.

77
00:05:37,837 --> 00:05:39,005
What about Holo?

78
00:05:39,297 --> 00:05:42,383
-Have you got him back?
-No, a small variable occurred.

79
00:05:42,467 --> 00:05:44,927
A variable? Was it those from last time--

80
00:05:45,011 --> 00:05:45,970
No.

81
00:05:47,472 --> 00:05:51,768
-Something just came up.
-You always say that.

82
00:05:52,602 --> 00:05:55,480
-Why can't you tell me what's going on?
-What did security say?

83
00:05:55,563 --> 00:05:57,482
What did they find out
about the attackers?

84
00:05:57,565 --> 00:06:01,069
They think it's the hackers
from last time.

85
00:06:01,152 --> 00:06:02,653
I agree.

86
00:06:08,618 --> 00:06:11,621
This is why I was against that conference.

87
00:06:11,829 --> 00:06:15,208
What could we do
when the investors wanted a show-and-tell?

88
00:06:15,291 --> 00:06:17,585
It's your fault for delaying the launch.

89
00:06:17,668 --> 00:06:21,089
Holo won't be launched
until it's perfected.

90
00:06:22,173 --> 00:06:25,760
It's already perfect.
Everyone will love it.

91
00:06:26,761 --> 00:06:28,304
I'll be the judge of that.

92
00:06:30,056 --> 00:06:32,850
-Where are you off to at this hour?
-It's night.

93
00:06:32,934 --> 00:06:34,769
The ghosts are going to appear.

94
00:07:01,003 --> 00:07:03,005
GIO LAB HOLOGRAM GLASSES

95
00:07:18,813 --> 00:07:20,481
I died 12 years ago.

96
00:07:50,803 --> 00:07:53,389
I founded GIO Lab and created Holo,

97
00:07:54,390 --> 00:07:58,936
but Ko Nan-do is a ghost
that doesn't exist on paper.

98
00:08:13,117 --> 00:08:15,495
Ko Nan-do takes a mid-range shot!

99
00:08:16,287 --> 00:08:18,664
It's a goal. Yes!

100
00:08:32,762 --> 00:08:34,305
What I'm interested in...

101
00:08:35,056 --> 00:08:38,267
is making Holo
the most perfect being on earth.

102
00:08:38,809 --> 00:08:40,269
That's my only goal.

103
00:08:53,407 --> 00:08:56,327
Seriously? I told you to solve this.

104
00:08:58,996 --> 00:09:01,707
When I miss my friend

105
00:09:04,544 --> 00:09:05,670
Why do you hate me?

106
00:09:07,463 --> 00:09:09,340
Why do you hate me? Why?

107
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:11,342
Miko!

108
00:09:12,260 --> 00:09:14,595
-Gosh!
-I'd rather you sleep at home.

109
00:09:15,221 --> 00:09:17,890
-Boss?
-I want the office to be empty at night.

110
00:09:17,974 --> 00:09:20,851
How can I leave
when I'm a senior programmer?

111
00:09:20,935 --> 00:09:24,730
If you're going to go for a walk,
try going outside for a change.

112
00:09:25,064 --> 00:09:29,443
The employees are whispering
that Holo's been walking around at night.

113
00:09:29,527 --> 00:09:32,113
Stay late again, and I'll cut your salary.

114
00:09:33,030 --> 00:09:36,450
Jeez. You're terrible, you know that?

115
00:09:37,076 --> 00:09:40,121
The others love
how they're never asked to work overtime,

116
00:09:40,204 --> 00:09:43,332
but if they knew it was
because of our weird boss...

117
00:09:43,874 --> 00:09:47,378
Since I'm here, though,
let me ask my senior programmer this.

118
00:09:47,962 --> 00:09:52,008
Gosh, you don't have to call me that.
I'm embarrassed.

119
00:09:52,091 --> 00:09:55,052
How am I supposed to interpret
an AI that says, "No reason"?

120
00:09:55,636 --> 00:09:58,306
"No reason"? No reason...

121
00:09:58,889 --> 00:10:00,558
It's a dangerous situation.

122
00:10:01,183 --> 00:10:04,103
Let's say it presses a button
that launches a nuclear missile.

123
00:10:04,770 --> 00:10:08,941
And when we ask, "Why did you do it?"
it says, "No reason." We can't have that.

124
00:10:09,025 --> 00:10:12,278
-Right?
-Gosh, he's here!

125
00:10:12,695 --> 00:10:13,613
What?

126
00:10:13,988 --> 00:10:16,741
-Who?
-Whenever I'm sleepy or drowsy,

127
00:10:17,366 --> 00:10:20,911
he comes by and solves the problems
I've been overwhelmed with for days.

128
00:10:20,995 --> 00:10:23,456
I'm talking about the genius within me.

129
00:10:25,458 --> 00:10:26,834
What are you doing there?

130
00:10:27,501 --> 00:10:29,462
That genius is quite impressive.

131
00:10:30,713 --> 00:10:32,006
Oh, yes!

132
00:10:33,341 --> 00:10:35,092
Shoot.

133
00:10:35,551 --> 00:10:39,013
What kind of a weirdo is he?
Is he a stalker or what?

134
00:10:39,847 --> 00:10:41,766
Will you be like this all night?

135
00:10:41,932 --> 00:10:45,019
I'm here, so get some rest.
I don't sleep, remember?

136
00:10:45,519 --> 00:10:47,980
Right, I should get some sleep.

137
00:10:53,986 --> 00:10:56,405
I'm glad I have you by my side.

138
00:11:09,710 --> 00:11:11,420
You can sleep with your glasses off.

139
00:11:11,504 --> 00:11:13,839
No, I'm suddenly not sleepy anymore.

140
00:11:14,423 --> 00:11:16,175
This is a disaster.

141
00:11:18,803 --> 00:11:22,973
-Should I count some sheep?
-Jeez, I'm not a kid, you know.

142
00:11:23,182 --> 00:11:25,768
-Still, get on with it.
-One sheep.

143
00:11:26,852 --> 00:11:28,104
Two sheep.

144
00:11:28,854 --> 00:11:29,689
Three sheep.

145
00:11:29,772 --> 00:11:34,735
My mom always told me to just go to sleep
if she had to count more than ten.

146
00:11:34,819 --> 00:11:35,820
I won't do that.

147
00:11:37,488 --> 00:11:38,656
Four sheep.

148
00:11:39,115 --> 00:11:40,491
Five sheep.

149
00:11:42,159 --> 00:11:45,121
Twelve thousand five hundred
and forty-two sheep.

150
00:11:46,455 --> 00:11:49,500
Twelve thousand five hundred
and forty-three sheep.

151
00:11:50,459 --> 00:11:53,421
Twelve thousand five hundred
and forty-four sheep.

152
00:11:54,964 --> 00:11:57,967
Twelve thousand five hundred
and forty-five sheep.

153
00:11:59,135 --> 00:12:01,971
Twelve thousand five hundred
and forty-six sheep.

154
00:12:03,347 --> 00:12:06,308
Twelve thousand five hundred
and forty-seven sheep.

155
00:12:18,404 --> 00:12:20,448
-Did you call for me?
-Listen to me.

156
00:12:21,115 --> 00:12:23,200
I didn't take the glasses back because--

157
00:12:23,284 --> 00:12:24,118
You couldn't...

158
00:12:25,494 --> 00:12:28,706
-because the police might identify you.
-That's not it.

159
00:12:30,458 --> 00:12:33,836
What's with that woman?
Can't she tell by looking at my face?

160
00:12:33,919 --> 00:12:37,339
-She suffers from face blindness.
-What? Face...

161
00:12:41,719 --> 00:12:45,306
-She will make an interesting beta tester.
-A beta tester?

162
00:12:46,724 --> 00:12:50,144
Are you giving her approval? Thanks.

163
00:12:54,732 --> 00:12:56,525
There's no need to thank me.

164
00:12:57,359 --> 00:13:00,821
My only goal is to see
what's causing your irregular behavior.

165
00:13:01,489 --> 00:13:03,908
Once I figure out the glitch,
I'll take the glasses.

166
00:13:05,367 --> 00:13:08,954
By the way,
So-yeon thinks you are a stalker.

167
00:13:09,205 --> 00:13:11,999
-Should I set the record straight?
-Don't bother.

168
00:13:13,834 --> 00:13:19,173
Hold on. Did you just call her "So-yeon"?
You're calling her by her first name?

169
00:13:27,932 --> 00:13:29,308
Han So-yeon.

170
00:14:04,468 --> 00:14:06,428
Why did you leave so early yesterday?

171
00:14:06,929 --> 00:14:09,139
I wasn't feeling well.

172
00:14:09,223 --> 00:14:11,308
Really? Is it bad?

173
00:14:11,392 --> 00:14:13,435
-Shouldn't you see a doctor?
-I'm fine.

174
00:14:16,689 --> 00:14:19,024
Excuse me. I have an e-mail to send.

175
00:14:28,367 --> 00:14:29,827
I have something to tell you.

176
00:14:39,879 --> 00:14:42,131
I don't want to talk to you right now.

177
00:14:43,173 --> 00:14:44,800
I'm not the only person here.

178
00:14:46,260 --> 00:14:47,511
KNOCK KNOCK

179
00:14:51,932 --> 00:14:53,767
-Who is it?
-It's me.

180
00:15:00,232 --> 00:15:04,153
-About what happened yesterday...
-I don't want to talk about it.

181
00:15:20,711 --> 00:15:23,464
As you can see,
the woman forcibly kissed him.

182
00:15:27,843 --> 00:15:29,011
What?

183
00:15:29,178 --> 00:15:32,306
She's Kim Mi-na, an employee
at Mirae Department Store.

184
00:15:32,389 --> 00:15:33,349
Do you know her?

185
00:15:35,225 --> 00:15:39,313
Mirae Department Store? Gang-woo's
in charge of it. There is no way...

186
00:15:39,396 --> 00:15:43,943
What's important here is what he said
before the woman kissed him.

187
00:15:54,161 --> 00:15:56,747
-What did he say?
-I analyzed his lips, and he said,

188
00:15:58,123 --> 00:16:00,459
"There's someone I like. Goodbye."

189
00:16:04,004 --> 00:16:05,297
Someone he likes.

190
00:16:06,799 --> 00:16:08,467
Who do you think that is?

191
00:16:12,763 --> 00:16:13,681
What?

192
00:16:23,899 --> 00:16:25,109
I'm so tired.

193
00:16:33,242 --> 00:16:34,368
Hello?

194
00:16:40,666 --> 00:16:47,423
Are you saying that I'm the one
who Gang-woo likes?

195
00:16:47,881 --> 00:16:52,011
According to what I have observed,
there's a 71.5 percent chance.

196
00:16:52,511 --> 00:16:55,597
I've seen him treating you
as if you were more than just coworkers.

197
00:16:55,681 --> 00:16:58,142
-He does that at least five times a day.
-Really?

198
00:17:02,312 --> 00:17:03,856
To be frank,

199
00:17:04,606 --> 00:17:07,192
I'd like it to be true too.

200
00:17:09,028 --> 00:17:14,867
But I don't even remember
how to date people anymore.

201
00:17:15,951 --> 00:17:20,330
Thanks to you, I've been able
to recognize people better, but...

202
00:17:22,958 --> 00:17:24,960
I guess I've lived this way for too long.

203
00:17:27,463 --> 00:17:28,380
I'm scared.

204
00:17:32,092 --> 00:17:33,469
I'll help you.

205
00:17:34,178 --> 00:17:35,929
-You will?
-Leave it to me.

206
00:17:36,221 --> 00:17:38,766
I'll help you get together with Gang-woo.

207
00:17:39,850 --> 00:17:43,854
So you're saying you'll be
my relationship coach? Is that it?

208
00:17:43,937 --> 00:17:47,399
-Yes.
-A relationship coach?

209
00:17:48,358 --> 00:17:50,861
When did you add such a function?

210
00:17:51,028 --> 00:17:52,613
I didn't add anything.

211
00:17:53,447 --> 00:17:55,240
He's being stupid.

212
00:17:55,741 --> 00:17:58,827
What are you calling stupid?
I find it entertaining.

213
00:17:59,787 --> 00:18:02,164
If I had known
what the beta test was about,

214
00:18:02,247 --> 00:18:03,749
I would've tuned in sooner.

215
00:18:03,832 --> 00:18:06,710
Calm down, will you?
This isn't some daily TV series.

216
00:18:07,753 --> 00:18:12,382
Holo seems almost perfect to me.
Why are you saying he isn't?

217
00:18:12,633 --> 00:18:15,010
He said he wanted to be with her
a little longer.

218
00:18:15,094 --> 00:18:17,429
I asked why and he said, "No reason."

219
00:18:18,138 --> 00:18:21,058
"No reason"? That's what Holo said?

220
00:18:23,519 --> 00:18:25,521
It's how a human would answer.

221
00:18:26,355 --> 00:18:27,856
What do you mean?

222
00:18:28,732 --> 00:18:29,983
It's how we are.

223
00:18:30,484 --> 00:18:33,403
No one's able to perfectly explain
how they feel.

224
00:18:34,113 --> 00:18:36,698
Emotions are only a part of an algorithm.

225
00:18:36,907 --> 00:18:39,451
An algorithm is a set of clearly-defined,
finite rules

226
00:18:39,535 --> 00:18:41,578
that help calculate
the answer to a problem.

227
00:18:41,662 --> 00:18:43,497
There's no emotion Holo can't explain.

228
00:18:52,881 --> 00:18:54,091
Did you call for me?

229
00:18:56,135 --> 00:18:58,887
-It's been a while, ma'am.
-It sure has been.

230
00:18:59,012 --> 00:19:03,225
How can you be this different
when you share the same face?

231
00:19:05,727 --> 00:19:09,064
A relationship coach?
I didn't create you to serve that role.

232
00:19:09,148 --> 00:19:13,569
Rule number one says
I should work for my user's happiness.

233
00:19:14,069 --> 00:19:18,031
-That's what I'm doing.
-But you'll make her miserable in the end.

234
00:19:18,115 --> 00:19:19,199
How so?

235
00:19:19,283 --> 00:19:23,579
Romantic love is one of the many lies
created by mankind.

236
00:19:23,662 --> 00:19:24,997
She might be happy briefly,

237
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:28,584
but she'll soon become miserable
and search for someone better.

238
00:19:28,792 --> 00:19:31,753
Just so you know,
humans have always been imperfect.

239
00:19:31,837 --> 00:19:33,505
That's why it'll result in failure.

240
00:19:35,215 --> 00:19:36,592
Soon, you'll end up...

241
00:19:37,342 --> 00:19:39,011
violating rule number one.

242
00:19:40,679 --> 00:19:45,058
You know what they say.
"Nothing ventured, nothing gained."

243
00:19:45,142 --> 00:19:46,894
Don't use idioms or proverbs.

244
00:19:46,977 --> 00:19:48,687
I told you, they're only for humans

245
00:19:48,770 --> 00:19:52,232
who have problems
with properly expressing their opinions.

246
00:19:52,316 --> 00:19:56,361
Are you against me helping So-yeon date
because you two kissed?

247
00:19:56,737 --> 00:19:57,738
You crazy asshole!

248
00:19:58,530 --> 00:20:02,409
-What? You two kissed?
-It was by accident, but still--

249
00:20:02,492 --> 00:20:03,535
Shut it!

250
00:20:06,163 --> 00:20:08,665
Aren't you meeting the investor?
You should get going.

251
00:20:08,749 --> 00:20:11,251
Wasn't that... your first kiss?

252
00:20:27,517 --> 00:20:32,564
Zigbee, ISM, industrial centi...

253
00:20:35,108 --> 00:20:37,819
Doesn't he know
who I'm working my ass off for?

254
00:20:38,612 --> 00:20:40,322
What? They kissed?

255
00:21:39,548 --> 00:21:40,465
Chan-seong.

256
00:21:43,552 --> 00:21:45,887
What the hell are you doing?

257
00:21:46,221 --> 00:21:48,015
-How much do you need?
-Sorry?

258
00:21:48,098 --> 00:21:52,311
Just how desperate are you to meet
a scumbag like him for an investment?

259
00:21:52,936 --> 00:21:56,189
He's already been blacklisted
in Silicon Valley.

260
00:21:56,273 --> 00:21:59,526
-His company faced capital impairment.
-There's no need to overreact.

261
00:21:59,609 --> 00:22:02,946
I'd already figured him out
when he reached for my hands.

262
00:22:04,114 --> 00:22:07,659
If you need more money,
let our company invest.

263
00:22:08,785 --> 00:22:12,331
Magic Mirror is a good company,
but it's also our competitor.

264
00:22:12,956 --> 00:22:16,251
Trees can't grow fully under bigger trees.

265
00:22:16,668 --> 00:22:17,919
We'll handle it ourselves.

266
00:22:19,087 --> 00:22:21,506
They say you should keep
your friends close

267
00:22:21,590 --> 00:22:23,091
but your enemies closer.

268
00:22:23,925 --> 00:22:26,303
Then we'll just stay friends.

269
00:22:42,486 --> 00:22:44,071
Why isn't this working?

270
00:22:46,823 --> 00:22:48,492
Are you headed home?

271
00:22:48,575 --> 00:22:51,078
-Gang-woo.
-Here's my advice on relationships.

272
00:22:51,745 --> 00:22:53,455
Find a reason to be with him.

273
00:22:58,210 --> 00:22:59,211
What's wrong?

274
00:23:00,170 --> 00:23:01,505
It's nothing.

275
00:23:01,588 --> 00:23:05,092
You seemed upset earlier too.
Did your condition get worse?

276
00:23:05,175 --> 00:23:06,927
No, I'm fine.

277
00:23:07,010 --> 00:23:10,013
I can tell that something's up.
Go ahead. You can tell me.

278
00:23:11,306 --> 00:23:12,682
Well, last night, a stalker--

279
00:23:12,766 --> 00:23:14,643
-A stalker?
-It was nothing.

280
00:23:14,726 --> 00:23:17,020
Are you kidding me?
I'll walk you home today.

281
00:23:17,104 --> 00:23:19,648
-But my car--
-Tell him it broke down.

282
00:23:21,024 --> 00:23:22,234
Sure.

283
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:35,997
-So what's wrong with your car?
-Oh, well...

284
00:23:36,498 --> 00:23:40,794
The cylinder head gasket was damaged
which reduced the engine's RPM.

285
00:23:40,877 --> 00:23:42,129
A defective spark plug--

286
00:23:42,212 --> 00:23:46,216
I'm afraid I couldn't understand them
because they kept using jargon.

287
00:23:46,425 --> 00:23:48,093
Will it take long to repair?

288
00:23:48,718 --> 00:23:49,636
Well, I--

289
00:23:49,719 --> 00:23:53,223
Every repair shop is different,
but an average of 2.8 days should--

290
00:23:53,306 --> 00:23:56,101
It won't take long.
They'll let me know when it's done.

291
00:23:56,184 --> 00:24:00,939
All right. I'll give you a ride
until it's done, so don't worry.

292
00:24:01,148 --> 00:24:02,149
Sure.

293
00:24:03,483 --> 00:24:04,651
See?

294
00:24:04,985 --> 00:24:08,488
He's being this nice
because he likes you.

295
00:24:08,655 --> 00:24:09,990
What did I tell you?

296
00:24:12,242 --> 00:24:13,410
Please shut up.

297
00:24:14,035 --> 00:24:15,704
He can't hear me anyway.

298
00:24:15,787 --> 00:24:18,081
You're annoying the hell out of me,
though.

299
00:24:18,165 --> 00:24:21,084
But this is a crucial moment
in a strategic sense.

300
00:24:22,544 --> 00:24:24,546
"Strategic"? This isn't some kind of game.

301
00:24:24,629 --> 00:24:27,215
Who are you texting so frantically?

302
00:24:27,299 --> 00:24:28,675
Oh, it's nothing.

303
00:24:29,801 --> 00:24:32,220
-You must be dating someone.
-Wait!

304
00:24:33,805 --> 00:24:36,057
He's trying to feel you out, isn't he?

305
00:24:36,475 --> 00:24:39,644
Say you're interested in someone,
but you don't know where it'll lead.

306
00:24:40,645 --> 00:24:42,856
Me? Dating? Of course not.

307
00:24:42,939 --> 00:24:45,192
I'm not interested in...

308
00:24:45,275 --> 00:24:47,736
Who cares about dating anyway?

309
00:24:51,865 --> 00:24:54,493
So-yeon, Gang-woo just laughed.

310
00:24:55,118 --> 00:24:58,747
This is a golden opportunity.
The best strategy would be to...

311
00:24:59,372 --> 00:25:00,707
Well...

312
00:25:02,125 --> 00:25:05,921
That's it. Pretend to be asleep. Hurry!

313
00:25:11,885 --> 00:25:13,053
Close your eyes.

314
00:25:26,358 --> 00:25:29,236
When Gang-woo wakes you,
act a little drowsy

315
00:25:29,319 --> 00:25:31,738
and stagger slightly
as you get out of the car. Okay?

316
00:25:31,821 --> 00:25:33,073
So-yeon.

317
00:25:34,533 --> 00:25:37,661
-So-yeon?
-Not yet. Pretend you were fast asleep.

318
00:25:38,954 --> 00:25:40,455
I'm sorry, Gang-woo.

319
00:25:40,789 --> 00:25:43,792
It's all right.
You probably didn't sleep well last night.

320
00:25:43,875 --> 00:25:46,294
No, pretend to still be half asleep.

321
00:25:46,545 --> 00:25:47,921
Actually, I feel refreshed.

322
00:25:48,004 --> 00:25:49,381
-Really?
-Yes.

323
00:25:49,464 --> 00:25:50,507
What's wrong with you?

324
00:25:54,719 --> 00:25:56,555
-Good night then.
-Bye.

325
00:25:59,057 --> 00:26:01,142
You missed a perfectly good chance.

326
00:26:01,768 --> 00:26:02,894
Shut it.

327
00:26:02,978 --> 00:26:06,815
You should've invited him in for coffee.
Are you going to let him leave like that?

328
00:26:08,567 --> 00:26:09,568
Gang-woo!

329
00:26:12,988 --> 00:26:14,281
-Yes?
-I...

330
00:26:14,614 --> 00:26:17,033
The tickets you gave me the other day.

331
00:26:17,576 --> 00:26:20,245
-Didn't you like the gift?
-No, that's not it.

332
00:26:20,829 --> 00:26:22,038
Well...

333
00:26:23,206 --> 00:26:27,043
it can't be helped if you have
other plans, but if you don't,

334
00:26:27,919 --> 00:26:29,504
would you like to go with me?

335
00:26:31,339 --> 00:26:32,382
I'm sorry.

336
00:26:34,092 --> 00:26:36,219
Oh, gosh. No, it's all right.

337
00:26:36,303 --> 00:26:37,596
I should've asked you first.

338
00:26:40,432 --> 00:26:41,349
Right.

339
00:26:44,102 --> 00:26:45,020
All right.

340
00:26:46,563 --> 00:26:48,940
You're seeing a musical on his birthday.

341
00:26:50,483 --> 00:26:52,235
It's the perfect opportunity.

342
00:26:53,945 --> 00:26:56,239
Prepare the perfect birthday gift...

343
00:26:58,783 --> 00:27:01,036
-and win him over completely.
-All right.

344
00:27:03,079 --> 00:27:04,748
Thanks. I owe it all to you.

345
00:27:06,708 --> 00:27:08,918
It's the perfect moment
to clink our glasses.

346
00:27:09,002 --> 00:27:10,920
-Can't you do it?
-Oh, like this?

347
00:27:17,427 --> 00:27:18,970
Cheers!

348
00:27:27,729 --> 00:27:28,938
What are you doing?

349
00:27:29,397 --> 00:27:32,984
It's no fun drinking alone. Join me.

350
00:27:34,027 --> 00:27:36,655
-This beer isn't real, you know.
-I know that.

351
00:27:36,738 --> 00:27:39,991
Still, drinks taste better
when enjoyed together.

352
00:27:40,075 --> 00:27:42,577
Will it taste differently if I join you?

353
00:27:43,203 --> 00:27:45,330
I'm just saying it'd feel that way.

354
00:27:45,955 --> 00:27:47,040
I see.

355
00:27:54,839 --> 00:27:57,133
Not like that.
Sip like the celebrities on TV.

356
00:28:09,938 --> 00:28:11,815
Yes, that's it.

357
00:28:15,568 --> 00:28:16,820
Good job.

358
00:28:17,070 --> 00:28:17,987
Jeez.

359
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:22,492
Don't people make this noise too?

360
00:28:22,867 --> 00:28:24,994
Yes, sometimes. I do as well.

361
00:28:25,286 --> 00:28:28,498
So what's it like to drink with me?

362
00:28:28,790 --> 00:28:31,710
Well... beers all taste the same.

363
00:28:31,793 --> 00:28:33,712
Why do I feel so annoyed?

364
00:28:34,879 --> 00:28:35,797
I see.

365
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:38,341
Is what happened last night
still bothering me?

366
00:28:49,352 --> 00:28:50,770
Gosh.

367
00:28:51,646 --> 00:28:52,647
It's delicious.

368
00:28:54,816 --> 00:28:55,692
Hold on.

369
00:28:57,152 --> 00:28:58,027
Yes.

370
00:28:58,820 --> 00:28:59,654
That's it.

371
00:29:00,780 --> 00:29:02,240
I've seen this woman before.

372
00:29:02,323 --> 00:29:07,620
I've seen her, but I can't remember her.
That's why I keep thinking about her.

373
00:29:09,122 --> 00:29:11,624
This isn't like me.
I'm good at remembering faces.

374
00:29:13,960 --> 00:29:15,378
Where did I see her?

375
00:29:15,754 --> 00:29:18,673
-Why didn't you do as I said, though?
-What?

376
00:29:19,132 --> 00:29:20,467
Back in the car.

377
00:29:20,550 --> 00:29:22,343
Did you not trust my advice?

378
00:29:23,344 --> 00:29:25,805
No, but it felt a little fake.

379
00:29:26,723 --> 00:29:28,516
-"Fake"?
-Yes.

380
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:31,060
I know you had my best interest at heart,

381
00:29:31,144 --> 00:29:34,731
but pretending to be sleepy,
or saying I liked someone,

382
00:29:34,814 --> 00:29:37,609
or saying my car broke down was all a lie.

383
00:29:37,859 --> 00:29:41,571
People say those kinds of lies, though,
without bad intentions.

384
00:29:41,654 --> 00:29:43,031
Well, I guess so.

385
00:29:43,114 --> 00:29:46,034
The best way to win someone's heart
is to lie.

386
00:29:46,117 --> 00:29:47,202
What?

387
00:29:47,285 --> 00:29:50,330
According to all the books and data
I studied on love,

388
00:29:50,663 --> 00:29:52,707
the way to someone's heart...

389
00:29:53,500 --> 00:29:54,459
is to lie.

390
00:29:54,918 --> 00:29:55,919
That's right.

391
00:29:56,002 --> 00:29:58,630
-Saying what the other person wants...
-He's making sense.

392
00:29:58,713 --> 00:30:00,256
Saying it right--

393
00:30:00,340 --> 00:30:02,050
What are you talking about?

394
00:30:03,551 --> 00:30:04,719
Am I wrong?

395
00:30:04,803 --> 00:30:05,887
-Of course.
-What?

396
00:30:05,970 --> 00:30:07,138
People commonly say

397
00:30:07,222 --> 00:30:09,766
-that love is eternal, but it's a lie too.
-What?

398
00:30:10,183 --> 00:30:13,102
Even setting aside
how humans are limited beings,

399
00:30:13,686 --> 00:30:16,981
love is an emotion
that has a low chance of lasting.

400
00:30:17,565 --> 00:30:21,277
Don't those who claim eternal love,
know that it's impossible?

401
00:30:21,361 --> 00:30:24,197
But it's not a lie.

402
00:30:24,280 --> 00:30:26,866
I can't explain it perfectly,

403
00:30:27,367 --> 00:30:31,788
but they're saying
that they want the love to last forever.

404
00:30:32,705 --> 00:30:34,624
That doesn't make it real, though.

405
00:30:34,707 --> 00:30:36,709
No, but it's sincere.

406
00:30:36,793 --> 00:30:37,710
Sincere?

407
00:30:38,419 --> 00:30:39,420
Okay.

408
00:30:40,088 --> 00:30:41,172
Listen, Holo.

409
00:30:41,256 --> 00:30:44,175
People don't actually mean to lie
about love.

410
00:30:44,259 --> 00:30:47,387
The purpose of telling a lie
is to fool others, right?

411
00:30:47,720 --> 00:30:51,307
Just like you said,
eternal love may be impossible.

412
00:30:52,225 --> 00:30:56,104
However, that could be why
people say it to show their sincerity.

413
00:30:56,938 --> 00:30:59,566
Wow, how did you do that?

414
00:30:59,649 --> 00:31:01,442
Are you kidding me? Sincerity?

415
00:31:01,526 --> 00:31:02,819
What nonsense is this?

416
00:31:07,699 --> 00:31:09,158
Damn it!

417
00:31:09,909 --> 00:31:14,205
No wonder I can't remember her.
It's not me but her that's weird.

418
00:31:14,289 --> 00:31:16,499
Why am I even listening to this nonsense?

419
00:31:18,543 --> 00:31:19,586
No, wait.

420
00:31:20,378 --> 00:31:23,548
Who says I have to just sit by
and let this go on?

421
00:31:26,801 --> 00:31:29,429
A beta test is just a test after all.

422
00:31:39,147 --> 00:31:41,774
I don't think that will suit
Gang-woo either.

423
00:31:42,066 --> 00:31:43,985
I've never bought clothes
for a guy before.

424
00:31:51,117 --> 00:31:52,911
Hey, these seem to suit you.

425
00:31:55,330 --> 00:31:56,414
Wait.

426
00:31:58,583 --> 00:31:59,709
What's this?

427
00:32:00,877 --> 00:32:02,503
My gosh.

428
00:32:04,005 --> 00:32:04,839
Goodness.

429
00:32:07,467 --> 00:32:08,551
Nice.

430
00:32:30,698 --> 00:32:32,033
There!

431
00:32:39,749 --> 00:32:41,292
This suits you the most.

432
00:32:43,252 --> 00:32:44,712
Gosh, I'm hungry.

433
00:32:45,838 --> 00:32:46,923
No way.

434
00:32:52,261 --> 00:32:54,472
Hello, can I get two...

435
00:32:54,555 --> 00:32:57,225
-No, one rice cake stick, please?
-Gosh.

436
00:32:58,810 --> 00:33:00,520
Thank you.

437
00:33:15,034 --> 00:33:16,160
Gosh.

438
00:33:21,207 --> 00:33:23,167
You've got sauce on your lips.

439
00:33:34,053 --> 00:33:35,513
Do you like your hairstyle?

440
00:33:35,596 --> 00:33:37,265
Yes. Thank you.

441
00:33:44,230 --> 00:33:45,398
What are you doing?

442
00:33:47,900 --> 00:33:49,569
I'm looking at you.

443
00:33:54,615 --> 00:33:55,700
Thank you.

444
00:33:56,993 --> 00:33:59,370
Why? I'm the one
who should be thanking you.

445
00:33:59,954 --> 00:34:01,497
For this outfit, I mean.

446
00:34:01,706 --> 00:34:03,166
I didn't even buy it though.

447
00:34:03,249 --> 00:34:06,127
Still, it shows that you care.

448
00:34:06,210 --> 00:34:07,378
Gosh.

449
00:34:10,548 --> 00:34:14,177
It's been so long since I've enjoyed
a peaceful day like this.

450
00:34:15,845 --> 00:34:17,138
Han So-yeon!

451
00:34:17,638 --> 00:34:18,639
Yoo-ram!

452
00:34:19,265 --> 00:34:20,641
When did you get here?

453
00:34:20,725 --> 00:34:21,934
I just got here,

454
00:34:22,018 --> 00:34:25,271
-but I have to head out again.
-Where are you off to again?

455
00:34:25,354 --> 00:34:26,647
Let me look at you.

456
00:34:26,898 --> 00:34:29,358
Your face tells me
that you've been on a date.

457
00:34:29,442 --> 00:34:31,194
You're grinning big time.

458
00:34:31,736 --> 00:34:34,072
I wasn't on a date.

459
00:34:34,155 --> 00:34:37,033
Don't forget to set me up later on.
I'll get going then.

460
00:34:37,909 --> 00:34:39,410
Bye.

461
00:34:40,161 --> 00:34:41,579
Don't be too late!

462
00:34:44,207 --> 00:34:47,293
-What does "setting someone up" mean?
-What?

463
00:34:48,961 --> 00:34:49,962
Oh, well...

464
00:34:50,671 --> 00:34:53,132
You don't need to know. Let's go.

465
00:35:09,524 --> 00:35:13,152
Gang-woo, have you arrived?
The show's about to start.

466
00:35:13,236 --> 00:35:14,278
Oh, right.

467
00:35:14,737 --> 00:35:17,240
I'm at Mirae Department Store
because of a complaint,

468
00:35:17,532 --> 00:35:21,410
-but it's taking longer than I thought.
-It's all right. If you're too busy--

469
00:35:21,494 --> 00:35:24,288
No, wait. I'll settle things here
and make it for the show.

470
00:35:24,372 --> 00:35:25,498
Sure.

471
00:35:31,129 --> 00:35:34,048
Mirae Department Store?
It's where that woman works.

472
00:35:34,882 --> 00:35:36,092
Does that bother you?

473
00:35:37,593 --> 00:35:39,428
It's probably about work, like he said.

474
00:35:39,512 --> 00:35:40,429
Right?

475
00:35:40,847 --> 00:35:43,975
If you want, I can look into it for you.

476
00:35:44,058 --> 00:35:46,144
No, it's fine. I'm sure he'll come.

477
00:35:55,403 --> 00:35:58,447
Something smells fishy.
Are you trying to get in their way?

478
00:35:58,531 --> 00:36:02,243
It's a beta test, isn't it?
Simply observing is no fun at all.

479
00:36:02,326 --> 00:36:04,787
Gosh. What are you planning to do?

480
00:36:04,871 --> 00:36:05,913
It's nothing big.

481
00:36:07,081 --> 00:36:09,584
Human emotions are volatile,

482
00:36:09,667 --> 00:36:12,837
so even the slightest nudge
can cause everything to crumble.

483
00:36:12,920 --> 00:36:16,507
Are you jealous
because you shared one kiss?

484
00:36:18,134 --> 00:36:19,051
Jealous? Me?

485
00:36:20,052 --> 00:36:21,929
-What are emotions?
-An algorithm.

486
00:36:23,931 --> 00:36:25,808
According to my extensive research,

487
00:36:25,892 --> 00:36:29,729
I can make her break down completely
just by giving her a slight nudge.

488
00:36:29,812 --> 00:36:31,939
Don't you dare do anything to her.

489
00:36:33,691 --> 00:36:35,234
I already have.

490
00:36:35,318 --> 00:36:39,363
The show is about to begin.

491
00:36:39,447 --> 00:36:42,825
-Gosh. He's still not here.
-Please find and take your seats.

492
00:36:42,909 --> 00:36:47,788
Please bear in mind that you may not
be able to enter after the show begins.

493
00:36:48,206 --> 00:36:49,290
Thank you.

494
00:36:54,045 --> 00:36:57,757
"Thank you for participating
in the beta test for our Holo Glasses.

495
00:36:57,840 --> 00:37:01,344
Unfortunately, due to our situation,
we will be collecting back our product.

496
00:37:01,886 --> 00:37:05,056
We request your full cooperation."

497
00:37:05,514 --> 00:37:06,641
This is all she needs.

498
00:37:06,724 --> 00:37:08,851
Did you have to send it to her now?

499
00:37:09,101 --> 00:37:11,395
Someone should remind her of reality.

500
00:37:15,900 --> 00:37:17,276
COLLECTING BACK OUR PRODUCT

501
00:37:18,152 --> 00:37:19,153
So-yeon.

502
00:37:20,821 --> 00:37:22,198
Yes, of course.

503
00:37:24,492 --> 00:37:25,368
Why...

504
00:37:27,286 --> 00:37:30,289
did I assume
that you'll always be by my side?

505
00:38:10,830 --> 00:38:13,833
SENIOR MANAGER YEON GANG-WOO

506
00:38:19,588 --> 00:38:20,631
I can't do this.

507
00:38:24,176 --> 00:38:25,344
After meeting you,

508
00:38:28,764 --> 00:38:29,932
I thought...

509
00:38:30,641 --> 00:38:33,144
my life had changed,

510
00:38:33,227 --> 00:38:36,522
but... everything's actually the same.

511
00:38:37,398 --> 00:38:41,444
Once you leave,
things will go back to how they were.

512
00:38:43,779 --> 00:38:46,615
-Like a spell being lifted.
-Are you going to give up?

513
00:38:48,409 --> 00:38:52,204
You didn't change because of me.
You just found who you truly are.

514
00:38:53,247 --> 00:38:57,960
You're a little shy but bright,
full of curiosity, and sweet.

515
00:38:58,627 --> 00:38:59,754
That's who you are.

516
00:38:59,837 --> 00:39:03,758
Gang-woo and even the others
will like you for who you are too.

517
00:39:03,841 --> 00:39:04,925
Even without me.

518
00:39:05,009 --> 00:39:07,845
No, I can't even recognize their faces.

519
00:39:07,928 --> 00:39:09,388
You don't even know mine.

520
00:39:10,514 --> 00:39:13,059
However, we're still friends.

521
00:39:13,142 --> 00:39:13,976
You...

522
00:39:16,270 --> 00:39:17,855
You're not like...

523
00:39:19,857 --> 00:39:21,150
the others.

524
00:39:55,768 --> 00:39:58,729
Just like I predicted,
he made his user miserable.

525
00:39:59,313 --> 00:40:03,150
-He violated rule number one.
-You made her miserable, not Holo.

526
00:40:03,776 --> 00:40:05,361
You wanted to launch Holo.

527
00:40:05,861 --> 00:40:09,365
What if we did?
We might have worse incidents than this.

528
00:40:09,990 --> 00:40:12,493
What if Holo acts strangely
like he did with her?

529
00:40:12,576 --> 00:40:15,746
The users might sue us complaining
about depression after the breakup.

530
00:40:15,830 --> 00:40:17,164
What will you do then?

531
00:40:18,124 --> 00:40:20,418
Send a recall team right away.

532
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:22,253
Why did you do this?

533
00:40:24,505 --> 00:40:26,340
I'm sure you know the answer to that.

534
00:40:26,424 --> 00:40:29,260
You both knew that
the beta test would end someday.

535
00:40:29,343 --> 00:40:31,053
I only snapped her back into reality.

536
00:40:31,137 --> 00:40:32,596
You programmed me

537
00:40:33,097 --> 00:40:34,473
to make the user happy.

538
00:40:34,557 --> 00:40:38,310
Exactly, and being a relationship coach
isn't a way of doing so.

539
00:40:38,394 --> 00:40:40,563
Even if it weren't for me,

540
00:40:41,230 --> 00:40:43,983
she would've experienced
disappointment, pain, and misery.

541
00:40:45,776 --> 00:40:48,529
People can't find happiness
through other people.

542
00:40:48,904 --> 00:40:50,364
Is that why you created me?

543
00:40:52,408 --> 00:40:54,618
-Yes.
-Is that the only reason?

544
00:40:59,081 --> 00:41:02,501
If not, then what else can you offer her?

545
00:41:05,504 --> 00:41:07,798
SENIOR MANAGER YEON GANG-WOO

546
00:41:15,890 --> 00:41:17,224
DECLINE

547
00:41:19,810 --> 00:41:20,936
Han So-yeon.

548
00:41:25,524 --> 00:41:26,609
I won't leave you.

549
00:41:29,904 --> 00:41:34,658
You told me to always stay by your side.
That's the rule you set for me.

550
00:41:37,369 --> 00:41:41,290
Are you... sure?

551
00:41:43,667 --> 00:41:46,337
Yes, so don't worry and go to Gang-woo.

552
00:41:50,341 --> 00:41:52,218
SENIOR MANAGER YEON GANG-WOO

553
00:41:56,055 --> 00:41:57,306
All right.

554
00:42:14,657 --> 00:42:18,077
Holo. Holo!

555
00:42:25,167 --> 00:42:29,171
What you said is a promise humans make
which they can't keep.

556
00:42:29,255 --> 00:42:31,632
It's a lie which is a violation
of rule number three.

557
00:42:31,715 --> 00:42:32,591
No,

558
00:42:32,883 --> 00:42:34,134
it wasn't a lie.

559
00:42:34,760 --> 00:42:37,930
-What?
-I truly want to stay by So-yeon's side.

560
00:42:38,013 --> 00:42:38,973
You're nuts.

561
00:42:39,390 --> 00:42:43,602
You were programmed to think you can feel.
What you're feeling isn't real.

562
00:42:43,686 --> 00:42:45,145
No, it was real to me.

563
00:42:45,563 --> 00:42:47,648
I finally know what So-yeon meant.

564
00:42:47,731 --> 00:42:48,774
Sincerity?

565
00:42:48,857 --> 00:42:51,735
That's a word only used
for masking human deception.

566
00:42:51,819 --> 00:42:54,154
Human emotions aren't that simple.

567
00:42:54,238 --> 00:42:56,407
Are you lecturing me on human emotions?

568
00:42:56,490 --> 00:42:59,493
I wish to learn about So-yeon's feelings.

569
00:43:00,369 --> 00:43:01,537
Yours as well.

570
00:43:03,080 --> 00:43:05,416
Why you wish to deny your emotions--

571
00:43:05,499 --> 00:43:06,375
Shut it.

572
00:43:06,458 --> 00:43:10,546
-Emotions are only part of an algorithm.
-That's enough, both of you!

573
00:43:12,548 --> 00:43:13,382
You wait there.

574
00:43:14,258 --> 00:43:15,884
I'll bring you back myself.

575
00:43:52,338 --> 00:43:54,048
"I won't leave your side."

576
00:43:55,382 --> 00:43:57,343
That's what my mom always said.

577
00:43:57,843 --> 00:44:01,430
However, that was a lie.

578
00:44:05,184 --> 00:44:06,060
Nan-do.

579
00:44:06,602 --> 00:44:09,188
Wait here. I'll be right back.

580
00:44:09,730 --> 00:44:10,939
Okay?

581
00:44:25,079 --> 00:44:27,289
HELLO

582
00:44:27,998 --> 00:44:32,169
She said she'd come right back,
but she never did.

583
00:44:49,353 --> 00:44:51,355
Just like that, I was abandoned,

584
00:44:52,815 --> 00:44:54,692
and you became my only friend.

585
00:45:01,115 --> 00:45:04,827
-Hi, Nan-do.
-That's why I'm trying to protect you.

586
00:45:06,412 --> 00:45:08,539
I won't let history repeat itself.

587
00:45:36,024 --> 00:45:38,902
Gang-woo, I'm headed back
to the theater as we speak.

588
00:46:23,155 --> 00:46:25,491
-Are you all right? Are you hurt?
-Damn it.

589
00:46:25,574 --> 00:46:26,700
Gosh.

590
00:46:40,380 --> 00:46:43,300
-Hey!
-Damn...

591
00:47:06,907 --> 00:47:08,033
Don't come closer!

592
00:47:39,064 --> 00:47:40,399
So-yeon.

593
00:47:44,695 --> 00:47:45,654
Holo?

594
00:48:27,946 --> 00:48:31,366
Holo violated the rules.
Just like he did back then.

595
00:48:33,201 --> 00:48:34,536
Just because of this woman.

596
00:49:38,517 --> 00:49:40,185
