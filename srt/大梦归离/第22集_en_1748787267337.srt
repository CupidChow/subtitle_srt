00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,700
Why haven't you bought your own 잘산 Hot contains a new scent?

2
00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:23,640
You want to see a world- slaves ship company?

3
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:58,640
I'm sorry, but I'm not sure if I can get the money back.

4
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:03,640
I'm sorry, but I'm not sure if I can get the money back.

5
00:01:03,640 --> 00:01:08,640
I'm sorry, but I'm not sure if I can get the money back.

6
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:13,640
I'm sorry, but I'm not sure if I can get the money back.

7
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:18,640
I'm sorry, but I'm not sure if I can get the money back.

8
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:23,640
I'm sorry, but I'm not sure if I can get the money back.

9
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:28,640
I'm sorry, but I'm not sure if I can get the money back.

10
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:33,640
I'm sorry, but I'm not sure if I can get the money back.

11
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:38,640
I'm sorry, but I'm not sure if I can get the money back.

12
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:22,640
He's the murderer.

13
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:31,640
So Pei Song is not the murderer.

14
00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:33,640
He's the murderer.

15
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:46,640
Over here.

16
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:47,640
Where's the car?

17
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:49,640
Where's the car?

18
00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:51,640
Where's the car?

19
00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:52,640
He ran away.

20
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:53,640
He ran away?

21
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:54,640
Chase him.

22
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:55,640
Chase him.

23
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:04,640
Be careful, Xiaoqiu.

24
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:05,640
Don't get caught.

25
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:07,640
You're so dangerous.

26
00:03:07,640 --> 00:03:09,640
Where's Aoyin?

27
00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:10,640
Let him run away.

28
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:13,640
I didn't expect that he would be so dangerous.

29
00:03:13,640 --> 00:03:15,640
What should we do?

30
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:17,640
We didn't catch Aoyin,

31
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:21,640
but we've already succeeded in forcing him to be a murderer.

32
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:23,640
There are so many people in Tianxiang Pavilion.

33
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:25,640
We can't let him escape.

34
00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:27,640
We can't let him escape.

35
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:30,640
He managed to force many people to do something against him.

36
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:31,640
So many people around Tianxiang Pavilion

37
00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:34,640
have probably seen that Aoyin

38
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:37,640
is a demonic demon that just talks andresearchs our body.

39
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:38,640
That's rightpanle.

40
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:41,640
He's the best he can possibly do.

41
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:43,640
Everyone here could apple aana for a very high noticeable disease.

This should've helped Recуть Sister Thatisic.

44
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:55,640
Choose yours.

45
00:03:57,640 --> 00:04:01,100
Come on.

46
00:04:01,620 --> 00:04:04,100
Africa!

47
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:27,180
D25

48
00:04:27,640 --> 00:04:31,640
Yes, they have to put it in front of the witness.

49
00:04:31,640 --> 00:04:35,640
But Sister Pei is still in the operation.

50
00:04:35,640 --> 00:04:38,640
You rest first. I'll think of a way to save her.

51
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:41,640
I have a way. Sister Pei has already thought of a way.

52
00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:45,640
Xiao Zhu, go and get the gun.

53
00:04:58,640 --> 00:05:01,640
I'll go and get the gun.

54
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:09,640
Did you bring the things I want?

55
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:14,640
I want them dead.

56
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:17,640
The years you want to return to,

57
00:05:17,640 --> 00:05:20,640
you can't hide them anymore.

58
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:25,640
You should know that the magic weapon of the City King

59
00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:28,640
has been used to save the memory.

60
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:31,640
I and Zhao Yuan Zhong have already given the memory

61
00:05:31,640 --> 00:05:38,640
that happened in the dungeon to the Lord of the City.

62
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:42,640
You go first.

63
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:48,640
Be careful.

64
00:05:55,640 --> 00:05:58,640
I'll go and get the gun.

65
00:05:58,640 --> 00:06:01,640
I'll go and get the gun.

66
00:06:01,640 --> 00:06:04,640
I'll go and get the gun.

67
00:06:04,640 --> 00:06:07,640
I'll go and get the gun.

68
00:06:07,640 --> 00:06:10,640
I'll go and get the gun.

69
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:13,640
I'll go and get the gun.

70
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:16,640
I'll go and get the gun.

71
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:19,640
I'll go and get the gun.

72
00:06:19,640 --> 00:06:22,640
I'll go and get the gun.

73
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:25,640
I'll go and get the gun.

74
00:06:42,640 --> 00:06:44,640
What are you eating?

75
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:47,640
Xiao Zhu, do you want to go?

76
00:06:48,640 --> 00:06:50,640
Let's go.

77
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:52,640
Let's go.

78
00:06:52,640 --> 00:06:54,640
Go.

79
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:21,640
Are you still worried about Zhao Yuan Zhong?

80
00:07:21,640 --> 00:07:24,640
It's been a day.

81
00:07:24,640 --> 00:07:27,640
I don't know if he's feeling sad now.

82
00:07:27,640 --> 00:07:30,640
Is he awake?

83
00:07:38,640 --> 00:07:41,640
Good news is that he's not.

84
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:46,640
What should we do next?

85
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:56,640
The medicine is ready.

86
00:07:56,640 --> 00:08:00,640
Next, we need to get the magic.

87
00:08:00,640 --> 00:08:03,640
Where are we going to find it?

88
00:08:03,640 --> 00:08:07,640
I guess the key to the magic is your mother, Lord Lanyan.

89
00:08:07,640 --> 00:08:09,640
Mother?

90
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:14,640
The demon said your mother is the descendant of the Sword-Messing Tree.

91
00:08:14,640 --> 00:08:17,640
Her real body is also the god mother.

92
00:08:17,640 --> 00:08:21,640
So I think since the white-legged bird is also the god mother,

93
00:08:21,640 --> 00:08:25,640
maybe your mother's real body can repair the white-legged bird.

94
00:08:25,640 --> 00:08:27,640
But...

95
00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:30,640
What's wrong?

96
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:37,640
The Sword-Messing Tree and the White-legged Bird

97
00:08:37,640 --> 00:08:40,640
were destroyed by the Nine-legged Gold Wings 500 years ago.

98
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:43,640
Then, two unknown demons appeared in the Red River.

99
00:08:43,640 --> 00:08:48,640
They used their own demons and blood to repair the magic and the white-legged bird.

100
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:52,640
But after the white-legged bird disappeared, the magic was dead.

101
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:55,640
The magic now

102
00:08:55,640 --> 00:08:59,640
is only a existence that's not small.

103
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:03,640
The magic is dead.

104
00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:06,640
The magic is dead.

105
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:09,640
The magic is destroyed.

106
00:09:09,640 --> 00:09:13,640
Your mother's real body is also the god mother.

107
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:17,640
Of course, there's no way to revive it.

108
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:23,640
So, Lord Lanyan

109
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:26,640
needs the magic power of the white-legged bird

110
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:29,640
to repair the white-legged bird.

111
00:09:29,640 --> 00:09:31,640
The white-legged bird's repair

112
00:09:31,640 --> 00:09:34,640
needs Lord Lanyan's real body.

113
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:37,640
Isn't that a dead end?

114
00:09:39,640 --> 00:09:42,640
Is it possible that the Great Huang

115
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:45,640
is destined to be a blessing?

116
00:09:49,640 --> 00:09:52,640
If so,

117
00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:54,640
I'm really afraid

118
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:56,540
that you'll隨便 the

119
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:24,960
Turning back, general An Peak

120
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:30,620
If you still do not wish to recover,

121
00:10:30,620 --> 00:10:35,160
I hope you hospitals become super together

122
00:10:35,160 --> 00:10:37,700
Apart from grudge and insult

123
00:10:37,700 --> 00:10:41,460
Who can move

124
00:10:48,580 --> 00:10:49,660
I appreciate that

125
00:10:49,660 --> 00:10:51,300
Let's start with you

126
00:10:51,300 --> 00:10:53,300
When I was in Mount Lingxi,

127
00:10:53,300 --> 00:10:55,300
I needed a wooden wooden wooden stick to walk.

128
00:10:55,300 --> 00:10:58,300
And the wooden wooden stick was already in the well.

129
00:10:58,300 --> 00:11:01,300
It was Xiao Jiu's blood that was accidentally smeared on it.

130
00:11:01,300 --> 00:11:03,300
The place where your blood was shed

131
00:11:03,300 --> 00:11:06,300
was a new point of view.

132
00:11:16,300 --> 00:11:18,300
So that's what it was like.

133
00:11:18,300 --> 00:11:20,300
Xiao Jiu had a spirit demon.

134
00:11:20,300 --> 00:11:22,300
It was a three-dimensional blood.

135
00:11:22,300 --> 00:11:25,300
It was this special blood that made Xiao Jiu's blood

136
00:11:25,300 --> 00:11:28,300
have the ability to re-emerge.

137
00:11:30,300 --> 00:11:31,300
How is it?

138
00:11:31,300 --> 00:11:33,300
I'm afraid it's too strong.

139
00:11:50,300 --> 00:11:52,300
I'm going to be a god.

140
00:11:52,300 --> 00:11:54,300
As long as Zhu Yan

141
00:11:54,300 --> 00:11:56,300
can teach me the real use of the Cloud Sword,

142
00:11:56,300 --> 00:11:59,300
I will definitely kill him.

143
00:12:01,300 --> 00:12:03,300
If there is a threat,

144
00:12:03,300 --> 00:12:05,300
the Heaven will destroy it.

145
00:12:05,300 --> 00:12:07,300
The soul will not be destroyed.

146
00:12:20,300 --> 00:12:22,300
Xiao Jiu.

147
00:12:30,300 --> 00:12:32,300
Come, Xiao Jiu.

148
00:12:50,300 --> 00:12:52,300
Xiao Jiu.

149
00:13:12,300 --> 00:13:14,300
You succeeded.

150
00:13:14,300 --> 00:13:16,300
You've saved the Great Moon.

151
00:13:16,300 --> 00:13:18,300
That's great.

152
00:13:19,300 --> 00:13:21,300
Xiao Jiu is really amazing.

153
00:13:22,300 --> 00:13:24,300
What about me?

154
00:13:24,300 --> 00:13:26,300
Shouldn't you praise me?

155
00:13:28,300 --> 00:13:31,300
You are also amazing.

156
00:13:34,300 --> 00:13:36,300
What is it?

157
00:13:36,300 --> 00:13:38,300
The kid?

158
00:13:49,300 --> 00:13:51,300
What is it?

159
00:13:53,300 --> 00:13:55,300
What's wrong?

160
00:13:57,300 --> 00:13:59,300
The water in the grave.

161
00:13:59,300 --> 00:14:01,300
It's been 100 years.

162
00:14:02,300 --> 00:14:04,300
It's been 100 years of blooming.

163
00:14:05,300 --> 00:14:07,300
It's been 100 years of ending.

164
00:14:09,300 --> 00:14:12,300
It's the only thing that can cure Bai Ze Ling.

165
00:14:13,300 --> 00:14:16,300
It's the only thing that hasn't been cured in 300 years.

166
00:14:19,300 --> 00:14:21,300
The heart that grows in this heart

167
00:14:23,300 --> 00:14:26,300
seems to be unable to cure it.

168
00:14:29,300 --> 00:14:31,300
300 years?

169
00:14:31,300 --> 00:14:34,300
How can we wait 300 years?

170
00:14:34,300 --> 00:14:36,300
Maybe...

171
00:14:36,300 --> 00:14:38,300
it won't even last three days.

172
00:15:04,300 --> 00:15:06,300
The Great Moon

173
00:15:29,300 --> 00:15:31,300
Protect the Great Emperor.

174
00:15:32,300 --> 00:15:34,300
Not dead.

175
00:15:34,300 --> 00:15:36,300
Not dead.

176
00:15:56,300 --> 00:15:57,300
It's so late.

177
00:15:57,300 --> 00:15:59,300
Are you still going to the Cangjuan Hall?

178
00:15:59,300 --> 00:16:01,300
Every moment of the Zhaoyuan Festival

179
00:16:01,300 --> 00:16:03,300
is full of torture.

180
00:16:04,300 --> 00:16:07,300
I must find other ways.

181
00:16:29,300 --> 00:16:31,300
Who is it?

182
00:16:59,300 --> 00:17:01,300
I'm sorry.

183
00:17:01,300 --> 00:17:03,300
I'm sorry.

184
00:17:03,300 --> 00:17:05,300
I'm sorry.

185
00:17:05,300 --> 00:17:07,300
I'm sorry.

186
00:17:07,300 --> 00:17:09,300
I'm sorry.

187
00:17:09,300 --> 00:17:11,300
I'm sorry.

188
00:17:11,300 --> 00:17:13,300
I'm sorry.

189
00:17:13,300 --> 00:17:15,300
I'm sorry.

190
00:17:15,300 --> 00:17:17,300
I'm sorry.

191
00:17:17,300 --> 00:17:19,300
I'm sorry.

192
00:17:19,300 --> 00:17:21,300
I'm sorry.

193
00:17:21,300 --> 00:17:23,300
I'm sorry.

194
00:17:23,300 --> 00:17:25,300
I'm sorry.

195
00:17:25,300 --> 00:17:27,300
I'm sorry.

196
00:17:27,300 --> 00:17:29,300
I'm sorry.

197
00:17:29,300 --> 00:17:31,300
I'm sorry.

198
00:17:31,300 --> 00:17:33,300
I'm sorry.

199
00:17:33,300 --> 00:17:35,300
I'm sorry.

200
00:17:35,300 --> 00:17:37,300
I'm sorry.

201
00:17:37,300 --> 00:17:39,300
I'm sorry.

202
00:17:39,300 --> 00:17:41,300
I'm sorry.

203
00:17:41,300 --> 00:17:43,300
I'm sorry.

204
00:17:43,300 --> 00:17:45,300
I'm sorry.

205
00:17:45,300 --> 00:17:47,300
I'm sorry.

206
00:17:47,300 --> 00:17:49,300
I'm sorry.

207
00:17:49,300 --> 00:17:51,300
I'm sorry.

208
00:17:51,300 --> 00:17:53,300
I'm sorry.

209
00:17:53,300 --> 00:17:55,300
I'm sorry.

210
00:17:57,300 --> 00:17:59,300
I'm sorry.

211
00:17:59,300 --> 00:18:05,300
I'm sorry,

212
00:18:05,300 --> 00:18:17,300
but

213
00:18:19,300 --> 00:18:21,300
can you go?

214
00:18:21,300 --> 00:18:23,040
I accept your askanitisfaction

215
00:18:24,560 --> 00:18:26,200
and I will take some writtenró

216
00:18:37,880 --> 00:18:39,080
Go

217
00:18:51,300 --> 00:18:53,300
I'm afraid you can't see clearly

218
00:19:02,300 --> 00:19:04,300
I'll help you to adjust the waist

219
00:19:06,300 --> 00:19:08,300
I'm afraid you can't see clearly

220
00:19:16,300 --> 00:19:18,300
What are you afraid of?

221
00:19:22,300 --> 00:19:24,300
I'm afraid I'll kill him

222
00:19:26,300 --> 00:19:28,300
He's useless

223
00:19:33,300 --> 00:19:35,300
I know you'll come back

224
00:19:36,300 --> 00:19:38,300
You'll come back

225
00:19:49,300 --> 00:19:51,300
But when we're at the last moment

226
00:19:52,300 --> 00:19:56,300
He can't control his strength

227
00:20:00,300 --> 00:20:02,300
I'll come back

228
00:20:05,300 --> 00:20:07,300
I'll come back

229
00:20:29,300 --> 00:20:34,300
I used to be as sharp as you

230
00:20:36,300 --> 00:20:38,300
But now

231
00:20:40,300 --> 00:20:42,300
I can't do it

232
00:20:47,300 --> 00:20:49,300
I still want to save him

233
00:20:51,300 --> 00:20:53,300
I don't want him to die

234
00:21:05,300 --> 00:21:07,300
I'll come back

235
00:21:19,300 --> 00:21:21,300
I can see clearly

236
00:21:24,300 --> 00:21:26,300
It's okay

237
00:21:27,300 --> 00:21:29,300
I'll come back

238
00:21:33,300 --> 00:21:35,300
You still have it on your face

239
00:21:52,300 --> 00:21:55,300
The person who paid for it didn't continue to look for Zhao Wenzhou

240
00:21:56,300 --> 00:21:58,300
They already know that Zhao Wenzhou is the most powerful

241
00:22:00,300 --> 00:22:03,300
It's time to add some pressure to them

242
00:22:03,300 --> 00:22:05,300
To make Zhao Wenzhou not be hiding

243
00:22:06,300 --> 00:22:10,300
Don't worry, this time Zhao Wenzhou is in my hands

244
00:22:26,300 --> 00:22:28,300
Is it painful?

245
00:22:32,300 --> 00:22:34,300
I'm happy

246
00:22:38,300 --> 00:22:40,300
Yes

247
00:22:42,300 --> 00:22:44,300
I want to be a human

248
00:22:45,300 --> 00:22:47,300
I want to be a immortal

249
00:22:49,300 --> 00:22:51,300
I want to be a immortal

250
00:22:52,300 --> 00:22:54,300
I want to be a immortal

251
00:22:54,300 --> 00:22:56,300
I want to be a immortal

252
00:22:58,300 --> 00:23:00,300
But I don't want to be a immortal

253
00:23:02,300 --> 00:23:04,300
I don't want to be a immortal

254
00:23:25,300 --> 00:23:26,300
Wei one

255
00:23:27,300 --> 00:23:28,300
Wei one

256
00:23:29,300 --> 00:23:30,300
Let's go

257
00:23:48,300 --> 00:23:49,300
It's 15 o'clock

258
00:23:50,300 --> 00:23:51,300
Five times

259
00:23:51,300 --> 00:23:52,020
Five times

260
00:23:52,020 --> 00:23:54,020
Xiao Zhu.

261
00:24:17,020 --> 00:24:19,020
Xiao Zhu!

262
00:24:19,020 --> 00:24:21,020
Xiao Zhu!

263
00:24:22,020 --> 00:24:24,020
Xiao Zhu!

264
00:24:38,020 --> 00:24:40,020
Xiao Zhu!

265
00:24:52,020 --> 00:24:54,020
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

266
00:24:54,020 --> 00:24:56,020
I'm sorry.

267
00:24:56,020 --> 00:24:58,020
I'm sorry.

268
00:24:58,020 --> 00:25:00,020
I'm sorry.

269
00:25:00,020 --> 00:25:02,020
I'm sorry.

270
00:25:02,020 --> 00:25:04,020
I'm sorry.

271
00:25:04,020 --> 00:25:06,020
I'm sorry.

272
00:25:06,020 --> 00:25:08,020
I'm sorry.

273
00:25:08,020 --> 00:25:10,020
I'm sorry.

274
00:25:10,020 --> 00:25:12,020
I'm sorry.

275
00:25:12,020 --> 00:25:14,020
I'm sorry.

276
00:25:14,020 --> 00:25:16,020
I'm sorry.

277
00:25:16,020 --> 00:25:18,020
I'm sorry.

278
00:25:18,020 --> 00:25:20,020
I'm sorry.

279
00:25:21,020 --> 00:25:24,020
Don't wake him up.

280
00:25:25,020 --> 00:25:28,020
You don't have this kind of brother.

281
00:25:32,020 --> 00:25:35,020
You killed his brother yourself.

282
00:25:37,020 --> 00:25:40,020
Are you going to be with him?

283
00:25:43,020 --> 00:25:45,020
You killed my brother first.

284
00:25:45,020 --> 00:25:47,020
You're a father and a brother.

285
00:25:47,020 --> 00:25:52,020
Do you still hope he can find out about this?

286
00:25:54,020 --> 00:25:56,020
Do you still have any hope?

287
00:25:56,020 --> 00:25:58,020
Do you still have any hope?

288
00:25:59,020 --> 00:26:01,020
You see him.

289
00:26:01,020 --> 00:26:04,020
You're looking at me.

290
00:26:06,020 --> 00:26:08,020
You're going to hug me.

291
00:26:08,020 --> 00:26:10,020
You're going to hug me.

292
00:26:10,020 --> 00:26:12,020
Shut up.

293
00:26:17,020 --> 00:26:19,020
You're going to hug me.

294
00:26:19,020 --> 00:26:21,020
Shut up.

295
00:26:21,020 --> 00:26:23,020
You're going to hug me.

296
00:26:23,020 --> 00:26:25,020
Shut up.

297
00:26:27,020 --> 00:26:29,020
You're going to hug me.

298
00:26:29,020 --> 00:26:31,020
Shut up.

299
00:26:31,020 --> 00:26:33,020
You're going to hug me.

300
00:26:33,020 --> 00:26:35,020
Shut up.

301
00:26:35,020 --> 00:26:37,020
You're going to hug me.

302
00:26:37,020 --> 00:26:39,020
Shut up.

303
00:26:39,020 --> 00:26:41,020
You're going to hug me.

304
00:26:41,020 --> 00:26:43,020
Shut up.

305
00:26:43,020 --> 00:26:45,020
You're going to hug me.

306
00:26:45,020 --> 00:26:47,020
Shut up.

307
00:26:47,020 --> 00:26:49,020
You're going to hug me.

308
00:27:03,020 --> 00:27:05,020
Mr. Shen.

309
00:27:07,020 --> 00:27:09,020
I'm here to see you off.

310
00:27:16,020 --> 00:27:18,020
Mr. Shen has been in the human world for a long time.

311
00:27:18,020 --> 00:27:21,020
I didn't expect that he would be so familiar with our customs.

312
00:27:21,020 --> 00:27:23,020
Your customs?

313
00:27:23,020 --> 00:27:24,020
Yes.

314
00:27:24,020 --> 00:27:28,020
Before the war, soldiers would drink wine.

315
00:27:28,020 --> 00:27:31,020
First, it was for the sake of the hero.

316
00:27:31,020 --> 00:27:33,020
It started early.

317
00:27:33,020 --> 00:27:35,020
Where's the second one?

318
00:27:37,020 --> 00:27:39,020
The second one is...

319
00:27:40,020 --> 00:27:42,020
If the hero goes, it won't be the same.

320
00:27:42,020 --> 00:27:44,020
But...

321
00:27:44,020 --> 00:27:47,020
This is the last one.

322
00:27:50,020 --> 00:27:54,020
He's been drinking wine all day.

323
00:27:54,020 --> 00:27:56,020
No, no, no.

324
00:27:56,020 --> 00:27:58,020
I didn't ask him this question.

325
00:27:58,020 --> 00:28:02,020
Mr. Shen, this is my own bottle of wine.

326
00:28:02,020 --> 00:28:04,020
It's a gift from God.

327
00:28:04,020 --> 00:28:06,020
It can be strong and strong.

328
00:28:06,020 --> 00:28:08,020
Let me give it to you.

329
00:28:12,020 --> 00:28:15,020
You'll be the one to blame.

330
00:28:17,020 --> 00:28:21,020
I just don't know how he's feeling.

331
00:28:21,020 --> 00:28:24,020
Is he feeling unwell?

332
00:28:24,020 --> 00:28:27,020
I hope he can keep his spirits up.

333
00:28:27,020 --> 00:28:30,020
In order to drink the wine,

334
00:28:30,020 --> 00:28:33,020
I don't want to be a stranger.

335
00:28:37,020 --> 00:28:39,020
Let's drink first.

336
00:28:42,020 --> 00:28:44,020
Okay, okay.

337
00:28:47,020 --> 00:28:50,020
I've never drank with him.

338
00:28:50,020 --> 00:28:54,020
I didn't expect that this is the first time.

339
00:28:55,020 --> 00:28:58,020
Still, the flowers should be there.

340
00:28:58,020 --> 00:29:00,020
Okay, then.

341
00:29:05,020 --> 00:29:07,020
Thank you.

342
00:29:10,020 --> 00:29:12,020
I got the bag from Mr. Shen.

343
00:29:12,020 --> 00:29:16,020
Wait, Mr. Please stop like this.

344
00:29:18,020 --> 00:29:20,020
Come with me, Osman,

345
00:29:20,020 --> 00:29:21,460
Love Could Be Home

346
00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:28,400
Finally

347
00:29:38,580 --> 00:29:40,620
If I put you back

348
00:29:41,880 --> 00:29:45,040
Please give this to Wen Xiao

349
00:29:45,060 --> 00:29:45,700
No no

350
00:29:46,020 --> 00:29:46,860
Don't run away

351
00:29:47,640 --> 00:29:48,820
You have to be safe

352
00:29:48,820 --> 00:29:52,820
When the time comes, you can play by yourself.

353
00:29:52,820 --> 00:29:54,820
I can't help you with this.

354
00:30:04,820 --> 00:30:06,820
What's wrong?

355
00:30:06,820 --> 00:30:09,820
I'll get the phone.

356
00:30:19,820 --> 00:30:21,820
I'm afraid of the wind.

357
00:30:33,820 --> 00:30:36,820
You don't have to be sad for me.

358
00:30:36,820 --> 00:30:41,820
The dead demon will become the star of the sun.

359
00:30:41,820 --> 00:30:44,820
I can also become the rain.

360
00:30:45,820 --> 00:30:48,820
As long as it's raining,

361
00:30:50,820 --> 00:30:53,820
I'll be with you.

362
00:31:01,820 --> 00:31:04,820
I'll put the dead demon to my mouth all day.

363
00:31:05,820 --> 00:31:07,820
Look at me.

364
00:31:08,820 --> 00:31:10,820
I'm so unhappy.

365
00:31:11,820 --> 00:31:13,820
God is not happy.

366
00:31:15,820 --> 00:31:18,820
I'm so happy.

367
00:31:24,820 --> 00:31:26,820
Wenjing.

368
00:31:32,820 --> 00:31:34,820
Where is Zhu?

369
00:31:34,820 --> 00:31:36,820
I thought he was here.

370
00:31:36,820 --> 00:31:39,820
He's gone.

371
00:31:44,820 --> 00:31:47,820
Although the dead demon...

372
00:31:48,820 --> 00:31:50,820
It's always raining.

373
00:31:50,820 --> 00:31:53,820
But these days, we're together.

374
00:31:55,820 --> 00:32:00,820
I think I'm used to him being with me.

375
00:32:00,820 --> 00:32:07,820
So the most scary thing in the world is the dead demon.

376
00:32:08,820 --> 00:32:11,820
If I can...

377
00:32:11,820 --> 00:32:14,820
Let go of the past and the present,

378
00:32:14,820 --> 00:32:17,820
and live a happy life,

379
00:32:17,820 --> 00:32:19,820
then...

380
00:32:19,820 --> 00:32:22,820
when I want to play,

381
00:32:22,820 --> 00:32:25,820
I can do it.

382
00:32:25,820 --> 00:32:27,820
It's a ghost.

383
00:32:32,820 --> 00:32:34,820
It's a ghost.

384
00:32:39,820 --> 00:32:41,820
It's a ghost.

385
00:32:41,820 --> 00:32:43,820
I...

386
00:32:46,820 --> 00:32:47,820
So,

387
00:32:47,820 --> 00:32:50,820
you can't just leave the house and go back.

388
00:32:50,820 --> 00:32:52,820
You can't just leave the house.

389
00:32:52,820 --> 00:32:54,820
Even if you don't go back,

390
00:32:54,820 --> 00:32:56,820
you'll be in the air.

391
00:32:56,820 --> 00:32:58,820
That's right.

392
00:32:59,820 --> 00:33:04,820
Then if someone uses the Divine Wood's nail to enter the Shiguang Mountains,

393
00:33:04,820 --> 00:33:07,820
and take it to the Shiguang's own flowerbed,

394
00:33:07,820 --> 00:33:11,820
and take the stone to take out the Shiguang Mountains,

395
00:33:11,820 --> 00:33:14,820
then you can repair the Shiguang Mountains.

396
00:33:16,820 --> 00:33:19,820
Lord Lu, are you confident?

397
00:33:19,820 --> 00:33:21,820
I am.

398
00:33:21,820 --> 00:33:24,820
But I must remind you, Lord Shen Yu,

399
00:33:24,820 --> 00:33:26,820
the time is running out.

400
00:33:26,820 --> 00:33:28,820
The world is still young.

401
00:33:28,820 --> 00:33:33,820
You must think about the difficulties you have to face.

402
00:33:44,820 --> 00:33:45,820
But...

403
00:33:45,820 --> 00:33:48,820
Didn't the Japanese ghost already be destroyed?

404
00:33:51,820 --> 00:33:55,820
The one that was destroyed was a paper I accidentally took from your room.

405
00:33:55,820 --> 00:33:58,820
The real Japanese ghost is still here.

406
00:34:17,820 --> 00:34:19,820
I...

407
00:34:21,820 --> 00:34:23,820
This is awesome.

408
00:34:23,820 --> 00:34:25,820
Lord Shen Yu, please be at ease.

409
00:34:25,820 --> 00:34:28,820
I will stay here forever.

410
00:34:29,820 --> 00:34:32,820
Sister Wen, take care.

411
00:34:42,820 --> 00:34:44,820
I'll wait for you here.

412
00:35:52,820 --> 00:35:55,820
How long do you think you'll be here?

413
00:35:56,820 --> 00:35:58,820
I think it's about time.

414
00:36:18,820 --> 00:36:20,820
Come out.

415
00:36:22,820 --> 00:36:24,820
Sister Wen.

416
00:36:24,820 --> 00:36:27,820
How are you feeling?

417
00:36:31,820 --> 00:36:36,820
I'm feeling sad for three hundred years.

418
00:36:37,820 --> 00:36:41,820
I finally understand what Lord Lu said.

419
00:36:41,820 --> 00:36:43,820
I'm not close to him.

420
00:36:43,820 --> 00:36:45,820
I'm fine.

421
00:36:50,820 --> 00:36:53,820
But I'm glad I got it.

422
00:36:53,820 --> 00:36:54,820
That's great.

423
00:36:54,820 --> 00:36:56,820
We can make a deal.

424
00:36:56,820 --> 00:36:57,820
Let's go.

425
00:36:57,820 --> 00:36:58,820
We'll go to the Shodai Temple next.

426
00:36:58,820 --> 00:37:00,820
Lord Lu has set off for a long time.

427
00:37:00,820 --> 00:37:02,820
Can we still make it?

428
00:37:02,820 --> 00:37:04,820
We can.

429
00:37:04,820 --> 00:37:08,820
Actually, I and Xiao Zhu are already ready.

430
00:37:13,820 --> 00:37:15,820
What is this?

431
00:37:15,820 --> 00:37:18,820
This is the needle that Xiao Jiu gave me last night.

432
00:37:18,820 --> 00:37:20,820
It's called the Soul-Ringed String.

433
00:37:20,820 --> 00:37:23,820
Xiao Jiu said that this silver needle

434
00:37:23,820 --> 00:37:25,820
was used to make the medicine for dead bodies and plants

435
00:37:25,820 --> 00:37:27,820
and to make them run into the house.

436
00:37:27,820 --> 00:37:32,820
It can make people fall into the house and enter the house.

437
00:37:32,820 --> 00:37:35,820
Soul-Ringed String?

438
00:37:35,820 --> 00:37:39,820
As long as we put this needle into Zhao Yun Zhou's heart,

439
00:37:40,820 --> 00:37:44,820
he will be forced to marry and enter the house to die.

440
00:37:44,820 --> 00:37:49,820
Also, the strength on his body can also be controlled.

441
00:37:50,820 --> 00:37:53,820
We can also give the king an explanation.

442
00:37:57,820 --> 00:37:59,820
After the Baizi Ling's repair,

443
00:37:59,820 --> 00:38:01,820
we will remove this needle

444
00:38:01,820 --> 00:38:04,820
and let Zhao Yun Zhou wake up.

445
00:38:10,820 --> 00:38:12,820
Xiao Jiu is awake.

446
00:38:13,820 --> 00:38:15,820
Xiao Zhu,

447
00:38:18,820 --> 00:38:20,820
you too.

448
00:38:30,820 --> 00:38:32,820
Mark, that's great.

449
00:38:32,820 --> 00:38:34,820
Luckily, you and the Shodai Temple have a friend.

450
00:38:34,820 --> 00:38:37,820
I also sent a farewell letter to the Shodai Temple.

451
00:38:37,820 --> 00:38:39,820
I also sent a farewell letter to the Shodai Temple.

452
00:38:39,820 --> 00:38:41,820
I am so sad.

453
00:38:42,820 --> 00:38:45,820
Wen Ji, what are you talking about?

454
00:38:45,820 --> 00:38:47,820
Soul-Ringed String?

455
00:38:47,820 --> 00:38:49,820
What Soul-Ringed String?

456
00:38:49,820 --> 00:38:51,820
I was sleeping at home last night.

457
00:38:51,820 --> 00:38:53,820
I didn't go to find Xiao Zhou.

458
00:38:53,820 --> 00:38:56,820
I didn't even know that you said that.

459
00:39:03,820 --> 00:39:05,820
I didn't get angry.

460
00:39:05,820 --> 00:39:07,820
Is it true, Xiao Jiu?

461
00:39:07,820 --> 00:39:09,820
There must be a problem with Lord Xiao Zhu.

462
00:39:09,820 --> 00:39:11,820
How could Lord Xiao Zhu have a problem?

463
00:39:11,820 --> 00:39:13,820
It seems that you have a problem with your brain.

464
00:39:13,820 --> 00:39:15,820
You can do it.

465
00:39:15,820 --> 00:39:16,820
Think about it.

466
00:39:16,820 --> 00:39:17,820
When we caught Ou Ying,

467
00:39:17,820 --> 00:39:18,820
she was already dead.

468
00:39:18,820 --> 00:39:19,820
You have a grass-bent forest.

469
00:39:19,820 --> 00:39:20,820
You have a weak body.

470
00:39:20,820 --> 00:39:21,820
Xiao Pi Hang,

471
00:39:21,820 --> 00:39:23,820
what if you die?

472
00:39:23,820 --> 00:39:24,820
What if I run away?

473
00:39:24,820 --> 00:39:26,820
You are a master of Lord Xiao Zhu's foot.

474
00:39:26,820 --> 00:39:28,820
You can't catch her like this.

475
00:39:28,820 --> 00:39:30,820
Where is she?

476
00:39:31,820 --> 00:39:33,820
Let her run away.

477
00:39:35,820 --> 00:39:37,820
It seems that she is a little strange.

478
00:39:40,820 --> 00:39:42,820
I killed Cheng Xia because of Ou Ying.

479
00:39:42,820 --> 00:39:44,820
I always think that it is a matter of the victim.

480
00:39:44,820 --> 00:39:46,820
We guessed that

481
00:39:46,820 --> 00:39:48,820
Ou Ying was killed by Li Lun.

482
00:39:49,820 --> 00:39:51,820
Could it be?

483
00:39:57,820 --> 00:39:59,820
What you mean is

484
00:39:59,820 --> 00:40:01,820
Li Lun didn't die.

485
00:40:02,820 --> 00:40:04,820
Where is she?

486
00:40:06,820 --> 00:40:07,820
Maybe

487
00:40:08,820 --> 00:40:10,820
she is with someone.

488
00:40:31,820 --> 00:40:33,820
I am sorry.

489
00:40:33,820 --> 00:40:35,820
I am sorry.

490
00:40:35,820 --> 00:40:37,820
I am sorry.

491
00:40:37,820 --> 00:40:39,820
I am sorry.

492
00:40:39,820 --> 00:40:41,820
I am sorry.

493
00:40:41,820 --> 00:40:43,820
I am sorry.

494
00:40:43,820 --> 00:40:45,820
I am sorry.

495
00:40:45,820 --> 00:40:47,820
I am sorry.

496
00:40:47,820 --> 00:40:49,820
I am sorry.

497
00:40:49,820 --> 00:40:51,820
I am sorry.

498
00:40:51,820 --> 00:40:53,820
I am sorry.

499
00:40:53,820 --> 00:40:55,820
I am sorry.

500
00:40:55,820 --> 00:40:57,820
I am sorry.

501
00:40:57,820 --> 00:40:59,820
I am sorry.

502
00:40:59,820 --> 00:41:01,820
I am sorry.

503
00:41:29,820 --> 00:41:31,820
I am sorry.

504
00:41:31,820 --> 00:41:33,820
I am sorry.

505
00:41:33,820 --> 00:41:35,820
I am sorry.

506
00:41:35,820 --> 00:41:37,820
I am sorry.

507
00:41:37,820 --> 00:41:39,820
I am sorry.

508
00:41:39,820 --> 00:41:41,820
I am sorry.

509
00:41:41,820 --> 00:41:43,820
I am sorry.

510
00:41:43,820 --> 00:41:45,820
I am sorry.

511
00:41:45,820 --> 00:41:47,820
I am sorry.

512
00:41:47,820 --> 00:41:49,820
I am sorry.

513
00:41:49,820 --> 00:41:51,820
I am sorry.

514
00:41:51,820 --> 00:41:53,820
I am sorry.

515
00:41:53,820 --> 00:41:55,820
I am sorry.

516
00:41:55,820 --> 00:41:57,820
I am sorry.

517
00:41:57,820 --> 00:41:59,820
I am sorry.

518
00:41:59,820 --> 00:42:01,820
I am sorry.

519
00:42:01,820 --> 00:42:03,820
I am sorry.

520
00:42:03,820 --> 00:42:05,820
I am sorry.

521
00:42:05,820 --> 00:42:07,820
I am sorry.

522
00:42:07,820 --> 00:42:09,820
I am sorry.

523
00:42:09,820 --> 00:42:11,820
I am sorry.

524
00:42:11,820 --> 00:42:13,820
I am sorry.

525
00:42:13,820 --> 00:42:15,820
I am sorry.

526
00:42:15,820 --> 00:42:17,820
I am sorry.

527
00:42:17,820 --> 00:42:19,820
I am sorry.

528
00:42:19,820 --> 00:42:21,820
I am sorry.

529
00:42:21,820 --> 00:42:23,820
I am sorry.

530
00:42:23,820 --> 00:42:25,820
I am sorry.

531
00:42:25,820 --> 00:42:27,820
I am sorry.

532
00:42:27,820 --> 00:42:29,820
I am sorry.

533
00:42:29,820 --> 00:42:31,820
I am sorry.

534
00:42:31,820 --> 00:42:33,820
I am sorry.
