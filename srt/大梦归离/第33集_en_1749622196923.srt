1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,120
What?

2
00:00:02,760 --> 00:00:05,600
What can we do?

3
00:00:07,660 --> 00:00:08,960
Mr. nori

4
00:00:13,020 --> 00:00:15,840
You already did it??

5
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:21,080
Uh, what do you care, huh?

6
00:00:21,080 --> 00:00:24,120
What are you talking about?

7
00:00:25,260 --> 00:00:27,960
Estetica.

8
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:31,960
I'm sorry, but I'm not sure if I can do it.

9
00:00:31,960 --> 00:00:35,960
I'm sorry, but I'm not sure if I can do it.

10
00:00:35,960 --> 00:00:39,960
I'm sorry, but I'm not sure if I can do it.

11
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:43,960
I'm sorry, but I'm not sure if I can do it.

12
00:00:43,960 --> 00:00:47,960
I'm sorry, but I'm not sure if I can do it.

13
00:00:47,960 --> 00:00:51,960
I'm sorry, but I'm not sure if I can do it.

14
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:55,960
I'm sorry, but I'm not sure if I can do it.

15
00:00:55,960 --> 00:00:59,960
I'm sorry, but I'm not sure if I can do it.

16
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:03,960
I'm sorry, but I'm not sure if I can do it.

17
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:07,960
I'm sorry, but I'm not sure if I can do it.

18
00:01:07,960 --> 00:01:11,960
I'm sorry, but I'm not sure if I can do it.

19
00:01:11,960 --> 00:01:15,960
I'm sorry, but I'm not sure if I can do it.

20
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:19,960
I'm sorry, but I'm not sure if I can do it.

21
00:01:19,960 --> 00:01:23,960
I'm sorry, but I'm not sure if I can do it.

22
00:01:23,960 --> 00:01:27,960
I'm sorry, but I'm not sure if I can do it.

23
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:31,960
I'm sorry, but I'm not sure if I can do it.

24
00:01:31,960 --> 00:01:35,960
I'm sorry, but I'm not sure if I can do it.

25
00:01:35,960 --> 00:01:39,960
I'm sorry.

26
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:43,960
Take out your如果 phone.

27
00:01:43,960 --> 00:01:47,960
Take out your if phone.

28
00:01:47,960 --> 00:01:51,960
I'm sorry but I'm not sure of my趰.

29
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:58,960
Sister Pei...

30
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:04,960
Sister Pei...

31
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:16,960
Xiaojiao...

32
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:24,960
Where is my brother?

33
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:53,960
Sister Pei...

34
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:23,960
Sister Pei...

35
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:53,960
Sister Pei...

36
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:23,960
Sister...

37
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:28,960
You finally succeeded.

38
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:36,960
Unfortunately,

39
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:41,960
I can't keep with you anymore.

40
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:46,960
This time,

41
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:50,960
I will not let you go.

42
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:53,960
I really want to go.

43
00:04:58,960 --> 00:04:59,960
I'm very happy.

44
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:02,960
I finally don't have sister's revenge.

45
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:06,960
I can also become sister's opening.

46
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:11,960
But...

47
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:14,960
But what?

48
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:17,960
Nothing.

49
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:25,960
But the fate of the opening is destined to be broken.

50
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:30,960
The fate of ice-blood is destined to be melted.

51
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:40,960
But...

52
00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:44,960
The last time,

53
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:47,960
I protected you.

54
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:53,960
Sister...

55
00:05:57,960 --> 00:05:58,960
You must...

56
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:04,960
Okay...

57
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:06,960
I will go.

58
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:09,960
Don't leave me.

59
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:14,960
Don't leave me.

60
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:23,960
You are a silent mountain.

61
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:26,960
You are a sad fire.

62
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:29,960
Protecting the last night.

63
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:31,960
But why don't you remember?

64
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:34,960
I am always by your side.

65
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:37,960
The wind is blowing around the flowers.

66
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:39,960
Protecting the only one.

67
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:42,960
Don't fall.

68
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:48,960
Sister Pei...

69
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:50,960
Sister Pei...

70
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:53,960
Sister Pei...

71
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:20,960
Sister Pei...

72
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:50,960
Sister Pei...

73
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:20,960
Sister Pei...

74
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:51,960
I have a way to deal with him.

75
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:52,960
What is it?

76
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:55,960
My true identity is a dream.

77
00:08:57,960 --> 00:08:59,960
Although I am not aware of it,

78
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:02,960
but at the same time,

79
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:05,960
I can also fire up.

80
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:15,960
I will not let Wen Zong Yu know

81
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:18,960
that I have brought Wen Zong Yu's

82
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:20,960
non-material fire.

83
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:22,960
If blood is in his waist,

84
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:24,960
you will be able to return to the inside.

85
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:28,960
He is more dangerous than death.

86
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:29,960
But...

87
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:32,960
But you will die like this.

88
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:40,960
Li Lun, what are you doing?

89
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:42,960
I will give you my half of my waist.

90
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:49,960
I will put the spirit and the spirit of the ice together.

91
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:54,960
Wen Zong Yu will not be considered anything.

92
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:01,960
Chu Yi Zhen,

93
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:06,960
I will give it to you.

94
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:08,960
Don't let me down.

95
00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:13,960
From the moment of birth,

96
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:17,960
we have always been together.

97
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:21,960
We have always been together.

98
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:29,960
I don't care how useless he is.

99
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:47,960
Lu Lian,

100
00:10:49,960 --> 00:10:51,960
I will give you

101
00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:55,960
my half of my waist.

102
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:17,960
I will not let you down.

103
00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:47,960
I will not let you down.

104
00:12:15,960 --> 00:12:17,960
I will not let you down.

105
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:29,960
I will not let you down.

106
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:33,960
I will not let you down.

107
00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:48,960
These eyes

108
00:12:49,960 --> 00:12:51,960
are not mine.

109
00:13:09,960 --> 00:13:11,960
Now I give it to you.

110
00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:13,960
I will not let you down.

111
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:16,960
I will not let you down.

112
00:13:23,960 --> 00:13:25,960
Don't be like me.

113
00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:38,960
Li Lun,

114
00:13:39,960 --> 00:13:41,960
I used to be a knight.

115
00:13:41,960 --> 00:13:43,960
I will protect the Great Empress.

116
00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:45,960
I will not die.

117
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:49,960
I will not let you down.

118
00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:53,960
I will not let you down.

119
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:56,960
Chu Yi Zhen.

120
00:13:59,960 --> 00:14:01,960
You must see clearly.

121
00:14:01,960 --> 00:14:03,960
Don't be so biased.

122
00:14:08,960 --> 00:14:10,960
I will not let you down.

123
00:14:38,960 --> 00:14:40,960
I will not let you down.

124
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:10,960
I will not let you down.

125
00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:26,960
I have made too many mistakes.

126
00:15:28,960 --> 00:15:29,960
So,

127
00:15:30,960 --> 00:15:32,960
let's die together.

128
00:15:38,960 --> 00:15:40,960
Xia Zhuo.

129
00:16:09,960 --> 00:16:11,520
Let's drink.

130
00:16:11,960 --> 00:16:12,960
Drink.

131
00:16:23,960 --> 00:16:25,960
Why are youANGia before,

132
00:16:25,960 --> 00:16:27,960
if there is no blood,

133
00:16:30,960 --> 00:16:32,960
untukangsuk.

134
00:16:33,960 --> 00:16:35,960
Ye Cang Bi,

135
00:16:35,960 --> 00:16:37,960
we are super power.

136
00:16:38,960 --> 00:16:43,960
I'm not sure if I can get the first one, but I'll try to get the second one.

137
00:16:43,960 --> 00:16:48,960
I'm not sure if I can get the first one, but I'll try to get the second one.

138
00:16:48,960 --> 00:16:53,960
I'm not sure if I can get the first one, but I'll try to get the second one.

139
00:16:53,960 --> 00:16:58,960
I'm not sure if I can get the first one, but I'll try to get the second one.

140
00:16:58,960 --> 00:17:03,960
I'm not sure if I can get the first one, but I'll try to get the second one.

141
00:17:03,960 --> 00:17:08,960
I'm not sure if I can get the first one, but I'll try to get the second one.

142
00:17:08,960 --> 00:17:13,960
I'm not sure if I can get the first one, but I'll try to get the second one.

143
00:17:13,960 --> 00:17:18,960
I'm not sure if I can get the first one, but I'll try to get the second one.

144
00:17:18,960 --> 00:17:23,960
I'm not sure if I can get the first one, but I'll try to get the second one.

145
00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:28,960
I'm not sure if I can get the first one, but I'll try to get the second one.

146
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:33,960
I'm not sure if I can get the first one, but I'll try to get the second one.

147
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:38,960
I'm not sure if I can get the first one, but I'll try to get the second one.

148
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:43,960
I'm not sure if I can get the first one, but I'll try to get the second one.

149
00:17:43,960 --> 00:17:48,960
I'm not sure if I can get the first one, but I'll try to get the second one.

150
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:53,960
I'm not sure if I can get the first one, but I'll try to get the second one.

151
00:17:53,960 --> 00:17:58,960
I'm not sure if I can get the first one, but I'll try to get the second one.

152
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:03,960
I'm not sure if I can get the first one, but I'll try to get the second one.

153
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:08,960
I'm not sure if I can get the first one, but I'll try to get the second one.

154
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:13,960
I'm not sure if I can get the second one, but I'll try to get the second one.

I'm not sure if I can get the second one, but I'll try to get the second one.

I'm not sure if I can get the second one, but I'll try to get the second one.

157

I'm not sure if I can get the second one, but I'll try to get the second one.

158

I'm not sure if I can get the second one, but I'll try to get the second one.

159

I'm not sure if I can get the second one, but I'll try to get the second one.

160
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:43,960
I'm not sure if I can get the second one, but I'll try to get the second one.

161
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:48,960
Take off.

162
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:56,960
Take off.

163
00:18:56,960 --> 00:19:01,960
Switch off.

164
00:19:01,960 --> 00:19:06,460
Switch off.

165
00:19:06,460 --> 00:19:10,960
Switch off.

166
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:14,500
Watch out!

167
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:14,960
Ah...

168
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:19,960
Ah...

There is a strong barrier here, so it will be injured.

187
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:12,960
Why are you here to leave the message?

188
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:14,960
Are you protecting me?

189
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:16,960
The teacher didn't say anything,

190
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:19,960
but it should be something very important.

191
00:22:19,960 --> 00:22:26,960

Why..

336
00:36:29,940 --> 00:36:31,120
Why i was always

337
00:36:32,540 --> 00:36:37,540
trying to force you to do it

338
00:36:43,660 --> 00:36:46,560
Even I do not understand

339
00:36:47,780 --> 00:36:50,220
Maybe if you know

340
00:36:50,740 --> 00:36:52,900
I promised your-

341
00:36:52,900 --> 00:36:57,900

342
00:37:23,900 --> 00:37:24,900
If...

343
00:37:26,900 --> 00:37:28,900
The phoenix ring that Wanzong gave me...

344
00:37:31,900 --> 00:37:33,900
Will it be reborn?

345
00:37:35,900 --> 00:37:37,900
It should be someone...

346
00:37:38,900 --> 00:37:44,900
who broke the gold and silver that the phoenix ring needed.

347
00:37:48,900 --> 00:37:50,900
Who could it be?

348
00:37:53,900 --> 00:37:58,900
Maybe it's someone who knows him very well.

349
00:38:00,900 --> 00:38:02,900
That's why I thought...

350
00:38:02,900 --> 00:38:03,900
Xiaoqiu.

351
00:38:22,900 --> 00:38:24,900
