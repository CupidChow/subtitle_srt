[Episode 20]

3
00:01:48,160 --> 00:01:49,430
Jiu?

4
00:02:01,130 --> 00:02:01,910
Jiu?

5
00:02:16,050 --> 00:02:17,100
Sister Pei!

6
00:02:18,230 --> 00:02:19,260
Sister Pei.

7
00:02:22,270 --> 00:02:23,190
Sister Pei.

8
00:02:25,460 --> 00:02:26,440
Don't kill her.

9
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:28,820
You really care about her, don't you?

10
00:02:28,860 --> 00:02:30,100
I just don't think

11
00:02:31,780 --> 00:02:33,460
you should alert them.

12
00:02:38,090 --> 00:02:38,880
After all,

13
00:02:40,940 --> 00:02:43,000
our target is Zhao Yuanzhou.

14
00:02:43,590 --> 00:02:44,850
I'll wait for it to dry.

15
00:02:49,170 --> 00:02:50,410
Just a small patch is wet.

16
00:02:50,410 --> 00:02:51,610
Why bother?

17
00:02:55,530 --> 00:02:56,550
Bai Jiu,

18
00:02:57,550 --> 00:02:59,530
we need to check your wrist.

19
00:03:30,660 --> 00:03:32,610
I am indeed from Chongwu Camp.

20
00:03:40,350 --> 00:03:42,530
You're very curious, aren't you?

21
00:03:44,030 --> 00:03:45,800
Yes, I am.

22
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:50,230
When did he start to seal my five senses?

23
00:03:54,470 --> 00:03:55,690
You each take one.

24
00:03:55,880 --> 00:03:58,600
I made these detoxification pills myself.

25
00:03:58,870 --> 00:03:59,840
Taste.

26
00:04:06,330 --> 00:04:07,630
What do you want from me?

27
00:04:07,630 --> 00:04:09,450
This is the new version of Huanling Powder I developed.

28
00:04:09,450 --> 00:04:10,530
Are you ready?

29
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:14,360
Smell.

30
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:17,610
I feel nothing.

31
00:04:17,890 --> 00:04:19,800
I even want to laugh.

32
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:25,230
I'm so scared.

33
00:04:25,590 --> 00:04:27,010
Sight.

34
00:04:27,090 --> 00:04:29,130
Then why are you covering my eyes?

35
00:04:29,190 --> 00:04:30,790
Cover your own eyes.

36
00:04:31,750 --> 00:04:33,180
I can't see the road.

37
00:04:33,220 --> 00:04:34,150
It's so scary.

38
00:04:34,170 --> 00:04:35,270
What's that sound?

39
00:04:35,290 --> 00:04:36,590
Put this on.

40
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:39,190
I think something is definitely wrong with this voice.

41
00:04:39,190 --> 00:04:40,130
Don't listen.

42
00:04:40,470 --> 00:04:41,450
Hearing.

43
00:04:47,890 --> 00:04:51,130
I never expected that seemingly harmless Little Bunny

44
00:04:51,830 --> 00:04:54,090
could be so meticulous.

45
00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:56,360
To accomplish great things,

46
00:04:56,390 --> 00:04:58,520
one must not only have good foresight

47
00:04:59,710 --> 00:05:01,420
but also patience

48
00:05:02,570 --> 00:05:04,490
to set up the game step by step.

49
00:05:05,220 --> 00:05:06,530
Zhao Yuanzhou,

50
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:10,440
from the moment you entered Tiandu City,

51
00:05:11,390 --> 00:05:12,720
you have been stepping into this chessboard,

52
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:14,670
bit by bit.

53
00:05:15,390 --> 00:05:18,280
Where do you think the list of these five people

54
00:05:18,350 --> 00:05:20,080
in the vanguard squad formed by

55
00:05:21,190 --> 00:05:23,280
the Demon Hunting Bureau came from?

56
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:26,170
Didn't Mr. Zhuo make it?

57
00:05:29,870 --> 00:05:31,470
So it was you.

58
00:05:33,860 --> 00:05:35,840
To obtain your inner core,

59
00:05:36,430 --> 00:05:38,360
we must seal your five senses.

60
00:05:39,580 --> 00:05:42,300
Bai Jiu could do that for me.

61
00:05:42,909 --> 00:05:44,950
However, he lacks experience

62
00:05:45,409 --> 00:05:47,980
and needs someone to protect him.

63
00:05:49,220 --> 00:05:50,360
Ms. Pei,

64
00:05:51,650 --> 00:05:53,390
you don't think our Chongwu Camp

65
00:05:53,390 --> 00:05:54,790
is a place you can enter

66
00:05:54,790 --> 00:05:56,600
or exit at will, do you?

67
00:05:57,030 --> 00:06:00,090
You deliberately arranged for me to leave Chongwu Camp

68
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:02,630
and then be noticed by the Demon Hunting Bureau.

69
00:06:02,630 --> 00:06:05,040
Ms. Pei, not only are you a good archer,

70
00:06:05,430 --> 00:06:08,360
but you are also the bodyguard of the Prime Minister.

71
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:11,360
Moreover, you have a grudge against Chongwu Camp.

72
00:06:11,710 --> 00:06:12,800
Who else would

73
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:14,650
the Demon Hunting Bureau choose

74
00:06:15,580 --> 00:06:17,840
besides an outstanding talent like you?

75
00:06:19,470 --> 00:06:22,870
Besides, you just suffered the loss of your younger brother.

76
00:06:23,430 --> 00:06:24,590
When facing Bai Jiu,

77
00:06:25,390 --> 00:06:27,720
would there be any emotional projection?

78
00:06:27,770 --> 00:06:29,850
Over time, when you grow deep feelings for him,

79
00:06:29,850 --> 00:06:32,380
you will surely risk your life to protect him.

80
00:06:33,460 --> 00:06:36,590
Bai Jiu calls you "Sister Pei" every day;

81
00:06:38,650 --> 00:06:40,510
you must be enjoying that, right?

82
00:06:40,870 --> 00:06:42,550
Despicable.

83
00:06:43,310 --> 00:06:45,400
If Bai Jiu couldn't succeed,

84
00:06:46,270 --> 00:06:48,070
I would still have a backup plan.

85
00:06:50,550 --> 00:06:52,400
Even Mr. Zhuo

86
00:06:53,830 --> 00:06:56,240
is one of your pawns.

87
00:06:57,730 --> 00:07:00,350
Zhuo Yichen is the leader of the Demon Hunting Bureau.

88
00:07:00,350 --> 00:07:03,280
It was reasonable for him to join the vanguard squad.

89
00:07:03,750 --> 00:07:06,080
Besides, he has the Cloud Light Sword.

90
00:07:06,110 --> 00:07:08,510
He's the only one who can kill you.

91
00:07:09,630 --> 00:07:11,440
As for Baize Goddess...

92
00:07:12,070 --> 00:07:13,560
I'll cooperate with Li Lun

93
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:15,550
to help him destroy the Baize Token.

94
00:07:15,550 --> 00:07:17,270
I promise I'll give you

95
00:07:17,970 --> 00:07:19,570
Zhao Yuanzhou's inner core.

96
00:07:22,140 --> 00:07:24,300
What about your promise to me?

97
00:07:25,390 --> 00:07:26,070
To merge

98
00:07:26,070 --> 00:07:28,550
the Baize Token hidden in you and Wen Xiao,

99
00:07:28,830 --> 00:07:31,110
we naturally need to bind you together

100
00:07:31,390 --> 00:07:32,710
to endure hardships

101
00:07:33,150 --> 00:07:35,280
so that you can understand each other.

102
00:07:37,070 --> 00:07:39,110
Now, there's only one last step left

103
00:07:39,110 --> 00:07:40,510
to seal your five senses.

104
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:44,120
I just need to use a silver needle

105
00:07:44,870 --> 00:07:46,550
to seal your touch,

106
00:07:48,110 --> 00:07:50,240
and everything will be accomplished.

107
00:07:54,830 --> 00:07:56,290
What does a mortal like you

108
00:07:57,230 --> 00:07:59,430
want with my inner core?

109
00:07:59,590 --> 00:08:01,700
Who wants your foul inner core?

110
00:08:03,250 --> 00:08:04,160
From the beginning,

111
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:06,620
what I want is always the Ever-Burning Wood.

112
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,500
It's been such a hard journey.

113
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:11,910
I finally found

114
00:08:11,910 --> 00:08:13,070
the Ever-Burning Wood that he wants.

115
00:08:13,070 --> 00:08:14,190
It is said that

116
00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:16,930
this is the last piece of Ever-Burning Wood in the world.

117
00:08:16,930 --> 00:08:18,660
We must keep a close watch on it.

118
00:08:21,370 --> 00:08:22,530
Eight years ago,

119
00:08:23,180 --> 00:08:25,390
you inhaled

120
00:08:25,730 --> 00:08:28,430
the last piece of Ever-Burning Wood that I had found

121
00:08:28,430 --> 00:08:29,760
with great difficulty.

122
00:08:32,220 --> 00:08:34,620
I have been looking for you for eight years.

123
00:08:52,090 --> 00:08:53,350
Go ahead, my disciple.

124
00:09:17,150 --> 00:09:18,020
Bai Jiu,

125
00:09:19,540 --> 00:09:21,510
aren't we your friends?

126
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:36,220
Don't come any closer.

127
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:38,790
I don't want to hurt you.

128
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:43,430
You've already said so much;

129
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:46,190
how could I possibly

130
00:09:46,190 --> 00:09:48,520
just let Little Bunny stick a needle in me?

131
00:10:11,380 --> 00:10:13,040
What's wrong, Zhao Yuanzhou?

132
00:10:14,460 --> 00:10:17,810
It seems like you can't cast your spells.

133
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:35,410
Jiu,

134
00:10:36,230 --> 00:10:37,440
think it through.

135
00:11:17,770 --> 00:11:18,580
Stop.

136

[Book of Rites]

137
00:12:15,110 --> 00:12:17,170
As expected, at the critical moment,

138
00:12:18,450 --> 00:12:20,180
you still wished for him to live

139
00:12:21,740 --> 00:12:23,200
and didn't want him to die.

140
00:12:28,590 --> 00:12:29,350
Don't worry.

141
00:12:29,830 --> 00:12:31,440
Whether it's Mr. Fan's order

142
00:12:32,150 --> 00:12:33,650
or the Prime Minister's,

143
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:35,620
it cannot suppress me.

144
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:40,610
The only one who can kill Zhao Yuanzhou

145
00:12:40,710 --> 00:12:42,060
is me.

146
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:46,550
I won't be anyone's executioner.

147
00:12:47,710 --> 00:12:49,030
Well, if we

148
00:12:49,610 --> 00:12:51,280
restore the Baize Token

149
00:12:52,310 --> 00:12:56,310
and are ultimately able to suppress Zhao Yuanzhou's malicious energy,

150
00:12:56,340 --> 00:12:57,680
will you still kill him?

151
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:03,730
The Yao Water was polluted,

152
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,860
and the Divine Wood went missing.

153
00:13:07,640 --> 00:13:09,160
The "if" you mentioned

154
00:13:09,460 --> 00:13:11,120
seems too distant to hope for.

155
00:13:11,910 --> 00:13:14,440
I won't answer such a hopeless hypothetical.

156
00:13:15,010 --> 00:13:16,120
But what if

157
00:13:16,940 --> 00:13:18,560
the hope is not distant?

158
00:13:20,690 --> 00:13:21,790
What do you mean?

159
00:13:22,270 --> 00:13:24,220
Zhao Yuanzhou once mentioned to me

160
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000
that the clues about the Divine Wood

161
00:13:27,350 --> 00:13:28,610
are in Situ's Mansion.

162
00:13:30,040 --> 00:13:31,290

Mr. Zhuo.

00:13:37,660 --> 00:13:38,580
Mr. Situ Ming.

165
00:13:38,620 --> 00:13:39,640
Mr. Zhuo,

166

please take Ms. Wen Xiao away through the back door now.

167
00:13:42,310 --> 00:13:44,470
Mr. Situ, why are you so panicked?

168
00:13:44,670 --> 00:13:45,950
What happened?

169
00:14:02,220 --> 00:14:02,910
Zhen Mei,

170
00:14:02,930 --> 00:14:04,090
what are you doing?

171
00:14:07,270 --> 00:14:09,360
Wen Xiao from the Demon Hunting Bureau

172
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:11,090
murdered the Prime Minister,

173
00:14:11,810 --> 00:14:13,400

They claimed the murderer is...

is Ms. Wen Xiao.

How could it possibly be Wen Xiao?

Many of the Prime Minister's attendants

00:14:36,920 --> 00:14:39,380
witnessed Wen Xiao publicly stop the horse.

185
00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:46,270
They said that after Wen Xiao got into the carriage,

186
00:14:46,270 --> 00:14:47,930
she brutally killed the Prime Minister.

187

Nonsense!

Wen Xiao was in the Demon Hunting Bureau all night.

All the guards can testify to that.

Chongwu Camp

is clearly framing me.

201
00:15:18,770 --> 00:15:19,650
In such a serious event

202
00:15:19,650 --> 00:15:20,790
as the Prime Minister's murder,

203
00:15:20,790 --> 00:15:22,850
they wouldn't casually frame anyone

something fishy going on.

The situation is unclear now,

00:15:30,910 --> 00:15:32,790
and there are a bunch of witnesses on both sides.

We cannot prove our innocence.

210

Mr. Zhuo,

211
00:15:35,580 --> 00:15:37,950
you should take Ms. Wen Xiao and leave now.

212

Before Chongwu Camp closes the city gates,

213
00:15:41,470 --> 00:15:43,680
I'll take Wen Xiao and leave the city as soon as possible.

214
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:44,390
No.

215
00:15:44,810 --> 00:15:46,210
I'm not leaving the city.

216
00:15:46,710 --> 00:15:48,370
They think I will escape.

So, at this moment, Tiandu City

That's true.

220
00:15:55,910 --> 00:15:57,770
But Tiandu City is not that large.

221
00:15:57,830 --> 00:15:59,710
Chongwu Camp has ample forces in Tiandu City.

222
00:15:59,710 --> 00:16:01,730
They could search the entire city in two or three days.

223

we have searched the entire Demon Hunting Bureau

and haven't found her.

241

Close the city gate immediately.

Oh.

That's my wife's bedroom.

Yeah,

I didn't expect it was him either.

273

I can take the chance to investigate the clues about the Divine Wood.

this murderer is highly skilled

288

293
00:21:40,680 --> 00:21:42,210
Why was he still reading it?

The pages of this copy of the Book of Rites

295

are yellowed.

Of course I know it's not Wen Xiao.

that the bones

340

have a smell of sulfur,

341

00:24:13,370 --> 00:24:15,930
What kind of demon has a sulfuric smell?

345
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:17,540
It should be Ao Yin.

346
00:24:23,660 --> 00:24:24,510
Ying Lei?

347
00:24:24,750 --> 00:24:25,960
Why are you here?

348
00:24:25,980 --> 00:24:27,040
Mr. Zhuo.

349
00:24:27,470 --> 00:24:29,120
Did anything happen to Mount Kunlun?

350
00:24:29,120 --> 00:24:30,380
Kunlun is fine for now.

351
00:24:30,780 --> 00:24:32,250
Currently, the Mountain God, Mr. Lu Wu,

352
00:24:32,250 --> 00:24:33,670
along with several other mountain gods,

353
00:24:33,670 --> 00:24:34,950
is guarding the stone pillar.

354
00:24:34,950 --> 00:24:36,050
I came here

355
00:24:36,070 --> 00:24:37,470
because I successfully purified the Yao Water.

356
00:24:37,470 --> 00:24:38,280
Mr. Zhuo.

357
00:24:42,110 --> 00:24:43,090
Great.

358
00:24:44,160 --> 00:24:45,190
I was going to

359
00:24:45,330 --> 00:24:46,930
return it to the Goddess.

360
00:24:47,320 --> 00:24:49,390
However, as soon as I entered Tiandu City...

361
00:24:49,390 --> 00:24:50,620
It's truly audacious,

362
00:24:50,620 --> 00:24:52,000
even daring to kill the Prime Minister.

363
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:53,150
It's said that it even eats people.

364
00:24:53,150 --> 00:24:54,470
It's a female demon, right?

365
00:24:54,470 --> 00:24:55,350
So there really are man-eating demons

366
00:24:55,350 --> 00:24:56,510
in the Demon Hunting Bureau.

367
00:24:56,510 --> 00:24:57,840
People are in panic now.

368
00:24:57,850 --> 00:24:59,190
The authorities have issued a wanted notice.

369
00:24:59,190 --> 00:25:00,810
Quickly catch her.

370
00:25:01,590 --> 00:25:03,390
A vicious female demon?

371
00:25:03,420 --> 00:25:05,550
Appeared in the Demon Hunting Bureau?

372
00:25:05,830 --> 00:25:06,390
It seems

373
00:25:06,390 --> 00:25:07,850
I need to help the Goddess.

374
00:25:11,100 --> 00:25:13,600
[Wanted Notice]

375
00:25:14,320 --> 00:25:15,270
Goddess...

376
00:25:16,420 --> 00:25:17,510
Goddess!

377
00:25:17,850 --> 00:25:19,010
I learned

378
00:25:19,070 --> 00:25:20,680
that the Goddess is wanted.

379
00:25:21,850 --> 00:25:23,850
It turns out she was framed by Ao Yin.

380
00:25:23,860 --> 00:25:25,060
What exactly

381
00:25:25,410 --> 00:25:26,960
is Ao Yin?

382
00:25:27,050 --> 00:25:27,790
Ao Yin

383
00:25:27,830 --> 00:25:30,260
is a bloodthirsty beast with claws like blades,

384
00:25:30,260 --> 00:25:32,060
residing in the volcanic area of the West Wilderness.

385
00:25:32,060 --> 00:25:33,150
It particularly likes

386
00:25:33,150 --> 00:25:33,840
eating human brains

387
00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:34,780
and hearts.

388
00:25:34,810 --> 00:25:35,710
It moves swiftly

389
00:25:35,710 --> 00:25:37,090
and is adept at hiding its tracks,

390
00:25:37,090 --> 00:25:38,870
preferring to travel alone under the cover of darkness.

391
00:25:38,870 --> 00:25:40,470
Volcanic areas

392
00:25:40,710 --> 00:25:42,410
happen to be rich in sulfur.

393
00:25:43,080 --> 00:25:43,970
Exactly.

394
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:46,210
Is there any way to find her?

395
00:25:46,230 --> 00:25:46,990
Of course.

396
00:25:47,010 --> 00:25:47,740
My lord,

397
00:25:47,790 --> 00:25:48,820
we have discovered

398
00:25:48,820 --> 00:25:50,560
that Zhen Mei is gathering soldiers from Chongwu Camp

399
00:25:50,560 --> 00:25:52,220
and preparing to take action.

400
00:25:52,730 --> 00:25:54,460
I'll go and find Wen Xiao first.

401
00:25:55,250 --> 00:25:56,300
I'll leave the matter of Ao Yin

402
00:25:56,300 --> 00:25:57,460
to you.

403
00:25:57,560 --> 00:25:58,290
Don't worry.

404
00:25:59,930 --> 00:26:01,550
Well, I ran away,

405
00:26:01,670 --> 00:26:02,840
and you ran away too.

406
00:26:03,730 --> 00:26:05,590
Chongwu Camp must be furious now.

407
00:26:06,090 --> 00:26:09,450
Chongwu Camp has been busy capturing demons to conduct research.

408
00:26:09,450 --> 00:26:11,040
Creating a little chaos for them

409
00:26:11,040 --> 00:26:12,600
would distract them.

410
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:18,800
Wen Zongyu has already affected your four senses.

411
00:26:19,030 --> 00:26:21,760
If your last sense is sealed with a silver needle,

412
00:26:21,910 --> 00:26:22,970
wouldn't you be...

413
00:26:23,040 --> 00:26:24,460
As a great demon, how could I

414
00:26:24,460 --> 00:26:26,590
be so easily stripped of my inner core?

415
00:26:26,820 --> 00:26:28,700
You'd better worry about

416
00:26:29,030 --> 00:26:32,960
how to clear your name from the charge of murdering the Prime Minister.

417
00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:35,690
I didn't expect that Wen Zongyu,

418
00:26:35,690 --> 00:26:37,050
who seems like a skilled doctor with a kind heart,

419
00:26:37,050 --> 00:26:38,580
could be so terrifying behind the scenes.

420
00:26:38,580 --> 00:26:40,310
He's been hiding his true face.

421
00:26:41,410 --> 00:26:43,340
There are many people who have been

422
00:26:43,670 --> 00:26:45,070
hiding their true faces.

423
00:26:53,390 --> 00:26:56,250
They should be bringing people to search here soon.

424
00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:00,290
Jiu.

425
00:27:00,440 --> 00:27:01,520
Jiu?

426
00:27:01,550 --> 00:27:02,840
Why are you back?

427
00:27:02,860 --> 00:27:04,280
I'm here to see my mother.

428
00:27:04,310 --> 00:27:05,110
Oh.

429
00:27:05,990 --> 00:27:07,480
Our friend is back.

430
00:27:14,390 --> 00:27:15,760
Didn't you say that once I return to Tiandu,

431
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:17,070
I would see my mother?

432
00:27:17,350 --> 00:27:18,100
Yes.

433
00:27:18,670 --> 00:27:19,370
Jiu,

434
00:27:19,850 --> 00:27:21,060
have you eaten yet?

435
00:27:21,080 --> 00:27:22,390
Would you like something to eat?

436
00:27:22,390 --> 00:27:24,670
I'll go make you something you like.

437
00:27:24,700 --> 00:27:25,840
Mr. Situ,

438
00:27:25,870 --> 00:27:27,430
please prepare three more sets of chopsticks and bowls.

439
00:27:27,430 --> 00:27:29,180
There are three more people here.

440
00:27:29,180 --> 00:27:30,330
Zhao Yuanzhou?

441
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:31,530
Ms. Pei?

442
00:27:31,550 --> 00:27:33,150
Why are you here?

443
00:27:33,300 --> 00:27:35,830
You escaped from the dungeon in Chongwu Camp?

444
00:27:46,270 --> 00:27:48,380
Why did you just run off?

445
00:27:49,400 --> 00:27:50,200
What?

446
00:27:50,660 --> 00:27:53,190
Are you going to Chongwu Camp to report again?

447
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:55,530
Zhao Yuanzhou,

448
00:27:55,870 --> 00:27:57,930
what nonsense are you talking about?

449
00:27:59,950 --> 00:28:01,750
I think you all have misunderstood.

450
00:28:01,750 --> 00:28:03,960
I wrote that letter on purpose.

451
00:28:03,980 --> 00:28:05,630
I was afraid that our Jiu would be in danger,

452
00:28:05,630 --> 00:28:06,310
so I sent...

453
00:28:06,310 --> 00:28:07,970
It's not a misunderstanding.

454
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:09,850
Bai Jiu

455
00:28:10,910 --> 00:28:12,940
is indeed a spy from Chongwu Camp.

456
00:28:13,340 --> 00:28:14,370
A spy?

457
00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:25,770
Why did you help Chongwu Camp?

458
00:28:31,690 --> 00:28:33,930
Do you remember what I said to you

459
00:28:34,030 --> 00:28:35,960
when the pagoda spirit tied you up?

460
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:41,060
Jiu,

461
00:28:41,960 --> 00:28:43,420
Let me ask you seriously.

462
00:28:44,280 --> 00:28:45,430
Are you

463
00:28:47,300 --> 00:28:49,050
hiding something from us?

464
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:55,680
I remember.

465
00:28:56,710 --> 00:28:59,110
Then let me ask you seriously one more time.

466
00:29:00,620 --> 00:29:02,770
Are you hiding something from us?

467
00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:19,910
So, would you rather be a traitor

468
00:29:23,040 --> 00:29:25,060
or be my friend?

469
00:29:30,530 --> 00:29:31,550
You choose.

470
00:29:34,230 --> 00:29:35,490
Mr. Zhuo,

471
00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:37,270
will you...

472
00:29:37,770 --> 00:29:39,860
still believe what I say?

473
00:29:41,280 --> 00:29:42,710
As long as you say it,

474
00:29:42,730 --> 00:29:43,880
I will believe you.

475
00:29:54,950 --> 00:29:56,830
Everything I did

476
00:30:00,190 --> 00:30:01,520
was for my mother.

517
00:31:14,990 --> 00:31:16,080
that cabinet is old

518
00:31:16,080 --> 00:31:17,390
and broken.

519
00:31:17,520 --> 00:31:18,480
And you can hide

520
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:19,990
somewhere else, can't you?

521
00:31:19,250 --> 00:31:24,490
♫Has anyone seen a bird with a broken tail?♫

522
00:31:19,990 --> 00:31:20,790
No!

523
00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:23,440
Then Mom won't be able to find me!

524
00:31:24,860 --> 00:31:29,620
♫The rain wet its feathers♫

525
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:31,080
If you're going to throw it away,

526
00:31:31,080 --> 00:31:32,320
just throw me away with it.

527
00:31:31,310 --> 00:31:36,530
♫There're no worries in its eyes♫

528
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:41,950
♫It just wants to sleep on a roof♫

529
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:08,520
Mom!

530
00:32:08,540 --> 00:32:10,190
Mom!

531
00:32:10,360 --> 00:32:12,180
Mom!

532
00:32:12,350 --> 00:32:14,160
Mom!

533
00:32:14,430 --> 00:32:16,740
Mom!

534
00:32:16,920 --> 00:32:19,260
Mom!

535
00:32:19,880 --> 00:32:22,380
Mom!

536
00:32:22,490 --> 00:32:24,440
Mom!

537
00:32:24,470 --> 00:32:26,190
Mom!

538
00:32:26,210 --> 00:32:28,020
Mom!

539
00:32:29,010 --> 00:32:30,020
Mom!

540
00:32:30,120 --> 00:32:30,760
Jiu!

541
00:32:30,920 --> 00:32:32,050
-Jiu.
-Mom!

542
00:32:32,080 --> 00:32:32,560
Come here!

543
00:32:32,560 --> 00:32:33,430
Come here!

544
00:32:33,520 --> 00:32:34,870
-Don't go out.
-I want to save my mom!

545
00:32:34,870 --> 00:32:35,760
Don't go out!

546
00:32:36,450 --> 00:32:38,680
Your mom is fine.

547
00:32:50,460 --> 00:32:51,260
Jiu,

548
00:32:52,250 --> 00:32:53,900
you're dreaming.

549
00:32:54,320 --> 00:32:56,250
When you wake up tomorrow morning,

550
00:32:56,250 --> 00:32:57,470
it'll be fine.

551
00:33:09,490 --> 00:33:10,470
Mom!

552
00:33:11,730 --> 00:33:12,770
Mom,

553
00:33:12,790 --> 00:33:15,020
open the door, please.

554
00:33:16,400 --> 00:33:19,350
I'll be good and not play hide-and-seek anymore.

555
00:33:19,390 --> 00:33:21,560
I'll throw away the cabinet.

556
00:33:21,790 --> 00:33:24,650
open the door, please.

557
00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:48,210
Mom, today is my birthday.

558
00:33:48,900 --> 00:33:50,280
I've grown taller

559
00:33:50,360 --> 00:33:51,710
and tanned a bit.

560
00:33:52,170 --> 00:33:54,830
I've also learned a lot from many medical books.

561
00:33:55,230 --> 00:33:57,640
I will definitely cure you.

562
00:33:58,300 --> 00:33:59,860
Are you really

563
00:34:00,030 --> 00:34:02,170
not coming out to see me?

564
00:34:02,570 --> 00:34:05,170
Mom, I miss you so much.

565
00:34:05,410 --> 00:34:07,580
Every year on my birthday,

566
00:34:07,650 --> 00:34:10,280
my wish is to see you.

567
00:34:10,310 --> 00:34:12,570
Could you please open the door?

568
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:34,210
Mom,

569
00:34:34,980 --> 00:34:37,460
I've finished reading all the medical books at home.

570
00:34:37,460 --> 00:34:40,170
I'm going out to find the best master to learn from.

571
00:34:40,170 --> 00:34:41,860
One day,

572
00:34:42,350 --> 00:34:43,989
I will definitely cure you.

573
00:35:39,790 --> 00:35:40,750
You are...

574
00:35:41,260 --> 00:35:43,420
I'm the new apprentice.

575
00:35:43,840 --> 00:35:44,880
My name is...

576
00:35:45,040 --> 00:35:45,680
Si...

577
00:35:47,440 --> 00:35:48,460
My name is Bai Jiu.

578
00:35:50,060 --> 00:35:50,910
Master,

579
00:35:50,940 --> 00:35:51,890
really?

580
00:35:51,930 --> 00:35:54,130
Can you really bring my mom back to life?

581
00:35:54,370 --> 00:35:55,950
I promise you

582
00:35:56,040 --> 00:35:57,900
I will bring your mom back to life.

583
00:35:58,360 --> 00:36:00,760
But I need your help with something as well.

584
00:36:00,980 --> 00:36:03,910
Join the vanguard squad of the Demon Hunting Bureau.

585
00:36:04,220 --> 00:36:07,110
I just need you to seal Zhu Yan's five senses.

586
00:36:14,390 --> 00:36:15,940
I know you have a kind heart.

587
00:36:15,970 --> 00:36:17,660
But Zhu Yan is a demon.

588
00:36:17,680 --> 00:36:19,880
Your mother was killed by a demon.

589
00:36:20,060 --> 00:36:22,340
If he isn't eliminated,

590
00:36:22,740 --> 00:36:24,010
there will be

591
00:36:24,080 --> 00:36:25,640
more children like you

592
00:36:25,640 --> 00:36:26,970
who lost their mothers.

593
00:36:31,480 --> 00:36:32,520
Jiu,

594
00:36:32,670 --> 00:36:34,240
you really are a fool.

595
00:36:34,310 --> 00:36:36,480
Your mother was not killed by a demon,

596
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:37,710
nor is she sick.

597
00:36:39,930 --> 00:36:41,730
You were deceived by Wen Zongyu.

598
00:36:43,720 --> 00:36:44,890
Then my mom is...

599
00:36:54,420 --> 00:36:55,650
Mr. Situ,

600
00:36:56,540 --> 00:36:58,400
don't hide it from Jiu any longer.

601
00:38:09,860 --> 00:38:10,720
Where is my mom?

602
00:38:16,750 --> 00:38:17,790
Where is my mom?

603
00:38:25,790 --> 00:38:27,090
This is your mom.

604
00:38:31,320 --> 00:38:32,970
Nonsense.

605
00:38:34,200 --> 00:38:36,260
Your father is not talking nonsense.

606
00:38:36,960 --> 00:38:37,940
Your mother

607
00:38:40,250 --> 00:38:41,760
is not human.

608
00:38:44,670 --> 00:38:46,380
Your mother, like Ying Lei,

609
00:38:47,070 --> 00:38:48,980
is half god and half demon.

610
00:38:49,490 --> 00:38:51,320
She was born in ancient times.

611
00:38:52,260 --> 00:38:54,020
She's the same age as the gods.

612
00:38:58,290 --> 00:38:59,130
Yes.

613
00:38:59,310 --> 00:39:00,940
Your mother is the descendant of the White Emperor Shaohao

614
00:39:00,940 --> 00:39:02,960
and the Divine Tree of Jianmu.

615
00:39:06,190 --> 00:39:07,480
Her true form shares

616
00:39:07,500 --> 00:39:10,840
the same origin as the Divine Wood that transformed into the power of Baize,

617
00:39:10,840 --> 00:39:12,640
inheriting its spiritual vein.

618
00:39:12,910 --> 00:39:14,880
Therefore, during the Blood Moon eight years ago,

619
00:39:14,880 --> 00:39:16,390
the disappearance of the Baize Token

620
00:39:16,390 --> 00:39:17,790
severely injured her.

621
00:39:17,790 --> 00:39:18,280
Mom!

622
00:39:18,280 --> 00:39:20,440
She was forced to manifest her true form.

623
00:39:20,440 --> 00:39:22,520
Mom!

624
00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:25,040
Mom!

625
00:39:45,560 --> 00:39:47,530
Even if my mom turned into a tree

626
00:39:47,630 --> 00:39:49,290
and returned to her true form,

627
00:39:49,320 --> 00:39:51,650
why has she never talked to me

628
00:39:52,950 --> 00:39:54,480
or been willing to respond?

629
00:39:56,690 --> 00:39:58,420
With the loss of the Baize Token

630
00:39:59,850 --> 00:40:02,180
and the Goddess absent from her position,

631
00:40:02,530 --> 00:40:04,860
the Wilderness has fallen into disarray.

632
00:40:05,690 --> 00:40:08,300
Therefore, Lord Bai Yan lost her soul

633
00:40:08,900 --> 00:40:10,710
and had no choice but to stay in her true form

634
00:40:10,710 --> 00:40:12,390
in the world.

635
00:40:15,810 --> 00:40:16,680
Mom,

636
00:40:18,170 --> 00:40:19,360
can you hear me?

637
00:40:21,820 --> 00:40:22,430
I...

638
00:40:23,750 --> 00:40:25,270
I'm Jiu.

639
00:40:27,250 --> 00:40:28,390
I'm back.

640
00:40:35,960 --> 00:40:36,970
I'm back.

641
00:40:54,930 --> 00:40:57,410
Can my mom return to her original form?

642
00:40:58,490 --> 00:41:00,550
As long as the Baize Token is repaired

643
00:41:01,050 --> 00:41:02,850
and the Wilderness is restored,

644
00:41:03,970 --> 00:41:05,640
your mother will come back.

645
00:41:09,480 --> 00:41:11,320
Why did no one tell me?

646
00:41:12,440 --> 00:41:14,690
You were too young at that time.

647
00:41:15,120 --> 00:41:15,960
I didn't know

648
00:41:15,960 --> 00:41:17,090
how you would accept

649
00:41:17,380 --> 00:41:19,490
all of this after I told you.

650
00:41:21,080 --> 00:41:23,880
For an ordinary person, it's indeed hard to accept

651
00:41:24,120 --> 00:41:26,720
without going through all this.

652
00:41:27,360 --> 00:41:29,690
But Bai Jiu has the right to know the truth.

653
00:41:31,780 --> 00:41:33,190
Although he is young,

654
00:41:33,610 --> 00:41:36,070
he is much more mature than children his age.

655
00:41:36,770 --> 00:41:37,940
I believe

656
00:41:38,920 --> 00:41:40,360
that if you had told him

657
00:41:40,380 --> 00:41:41,660
the truth back then,

658
00:41:42,290 --> 00:41:43,850
Jiu would have understood.

659
00:41:45,030 --> 00:41:46,130
If you

660
00:41:46,240 --> 00:41:48,020
had told me the truth earlier,

661
00:41:49,290 --> 00:41:51,950
perhaps I wouldn't have been used by Wen Zongyu.

662
00:41:52,760 --> 00:41:54,250
I'm sorry.

663
00:41:54,270 --> 00:41:55,030
No.

664
00:41:55,880 --> 00:41:57,030
It was my fault.

665
00:41:59,490 --> 00:42:00,470
I'm sorry.

666
00:42:02,680 --> 00:42:03,850
I was wrong.

667
00:42:06,500 --> 00:42:07,600
I'm sorry.

668
00:42:09,130 --> 00:42:10,650
I hurt you guys.

669
00:42:12,290 --> 00:42:13,410
All of you

670
00:42:13,630 --> 00:42:14,960
have been sincere to me,

671
00:42:17,260 --> 00:42:19,140
but I have let down your trust.

672
00:42:20,500 --> 00:42:21,670
Jiu.

673
00:42:42,020 --> 00:42:43,130
Jiu,

674
00:42:43,880 --> 00:42:45,200
you've grown up.

675
00:42:45,970 --> 00:42:47,520
The bond between father and son,

676
00:42:47,520 --> 00:42:49,180
the loyalty between friends,

677
00:42:49,570 --> 00:42:51,630
rights and wrongs, gains and losses—

678
00:42:53,320 --> 00:42:55,350
you can understand them on your own.

679
00:42:58,940 --> 00:43:00,470
It's okay to make mistakes.

680
00:43:02,530 --> 00:43:03,620
As long as

681
00:43:03,640 --> 00:43:05,810
you can bear the cost of growing up

682
00:43:07,140 --> 00:43:08,400
and try to make amends.

683
00:43:14,050 --> 00:43:15,850
The sea of suffering is endless.

684
00:43:16,660 --> 00:43:18,920
As long as you return to the shore in time,

685
00:43:19,330 --> 00:43:22,390
there will still be a brilliant sunset waiting for you.

686
00:43:30,760 --> 00:43:31,560
In fact,

687
00:43:32,120 --> 00:43:33,720
the real culprit

688
00:43:34,680 --> 00:43:35,960
