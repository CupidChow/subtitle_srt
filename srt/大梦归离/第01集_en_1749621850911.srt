1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,400
Then, when the current mon but become any size can always be could...

2
00:00:06,300 --> 00:00:06,400
刀

3
00:00:07,900 --> 00:00:08,840
It's that.

4
00:00:09,100 --> 00:00:10,900
What's the difference?

5
00:00:15,400 --> 00:00:17,200
I will make inom antifreeze.

6
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:21,340
However, I have questioned both between it or it want hope.

7
00:00:22,900 --> 00:00:25,200
I left you uncooperated.

8
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:27,320
That was just how.

9
00:00:27,320 --> 00:00:32,320
I'm sorry, but I'm not sure if I should be able to do that.

10
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:37,320
I'm sorry, but I'm not sure if I should be able to do that.

11
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:42,320
I'm sorry, but I'm not sure if I should be able to do that.

12
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:47,320
I'm sorry, but I'm not sure if I should be able to do that.

13
00:00:47,320 --> 00:00:52,320
I'm sorry, but I'm not sure if I should be able to do that.

14
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:57,320
I'm sorry, but I'm not sure if I should be able to do that.

15
00:00:57,320 --> 00:01:02,320
I'm sorry, but I'm not sure if I should be able to do that.

16
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:07,320
I'm sorry, but I'm not sure if I should be able to do that.

17
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:12,320
I'm sorry, but I'm not sure if I should be able to do that.

18
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:17,320
I'm sorry, but I'm not sure if I should be able to do that.

19
00:01:17,320 --> 00:01:22,320
I'm sorry, but I'm not sure if I should be able to do that.

20
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:27,320
I'm sorry, but I'm not sure if I should be able to do that.

21
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:32,320
I'm sorry, but I'm not sure if I should be able to do that.

22
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:37,320
I'm sorry, but I'm not sure if I should be able to do that.

23
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:42,320
I'm sorry, but I'm not sure if I should be able to do that.

24
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:47,320
I'm sorry, but I'm not sure if I should be able to do that.

25
00:01:47,320 --> 00:01:52,320
I'm sorry, but I'm not sure if I should be able to do that.

26
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:57,320
I'm sorry, but I'm not sure if I should be able to do that.

27
00:01:57,320 --> 00:02:02,320
I'm sorry, but I'm not sure if I should be able to do that.

28
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:06,320
I'm sorry, but I'm not sure if I should be able to do that.

29
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:10,320
I'm sorry, but I'm not sure if I should be able to do that.

30
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:15,320
I'm sorry, but I'm not sure if I should be able to do that.

31
00:02:15,320 --> 00:02:20,320
I'm sorry, but I'm not sure if I should be able to do that.

32
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:25,320
I'm sorry, but I'm not sure if I should be able to do that.

33
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:30,320
I'm sorry, but I'm not sure if I should be able to do that.

34
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:35,320
I'm sorry, but I'm not sure if I should be able to do that.

35
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:39,320
Hurry and get up!

36
00:02:39,320 --> 00:02:41,320
Come on!

37
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:46,320
It's raining again. At least we can't go.

38
00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:55,320
Heaven has given me medicine. Don't think anymore.

39
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:04,320
The weather is cold, so I've been in the clouds for half a day. It's really good.

40
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:10,320
Go on, hurry up.

41
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:10,840
・

42
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:12,320
Lao-Ban!

43
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:14,320
Thank you.

44
00:03:21,320 --> 00:03:22,320
Your hobbies!

45
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:23,520
What should I do?

46
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:29,320
Listen carefully.

47
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:31,320
Go and sleep.

48
00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:35,320
Old Fan, I'm not a word.

49
00:03:35,320 --> 00:03:40,320
Did you write salt or sugar?

50
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:45,320
Salt.

51
00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:05,320
I'm here to visit Lord Zhuo Yichen.

52
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:08,320
Please tell me.

53
00:04:09,320 --> 00:04:11,320
Where's the guest?

54
00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:12,320
No.

55
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:14,320
Then what do you come to visit?

56
00:04:15,320 --> 00:04:17,320
I'm bored.

57
00:04:17,320 --> 00:04:20,320
I want to find Lord Zhuo to drink.

58
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:22,320
Lord Zhuo is busy with his affairs.

59
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:23,320
How can he drink?

60
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:25,320
You're so generous and generous.

61
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:27,320
I've seen a lot of people coming here.

62
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:29,320
Let's go.

63
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:32,320
But I'm not a person.

64
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:40,320
I'm a demon.

65
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:42,320
You go to the boat.

66
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:45,320
Tell Lord Zhuo Yichen.

67
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:48,320
He always wants to kill a demon.

68
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:51,320
Zhu Yan.

69
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:54,320
Zhu Yan.

70
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:58,320
I'm here to see him.

71
00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:00,320
Lord Zhuo.

72
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:01,320
Zhu Yan is here.

73
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:03,320
Lord Zhuo.

74
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:19,320
Thank you, sister.

75
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:22,320
Why do you have a sharp tongue?

76
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:25,320
Why do you wear a mask?

77
00:05:27,320 --> 00:05:30,320
I'm afraid that the sun will be out in the night.

78
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:34,320
I can't draw as many pearls as I want.

79
00:05:35,320 --> 00:05:36,320
That makes sense.

80
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:41,320
Then give me a cup of wine.

81
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:53,320
I'm here to see Lord Zhuo.

82
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:55,320
I'm here to see him.

83
00:05:55,320 --> 00:05:57,320
I'm here to see him.

84
00:05:57,320 --> 00:05:59,320
I'm here to see him.

85
00:05:59,320 --> 00:06:01,320
I'm here to see him.

86
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:03,320
I'm here to see him.

87
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:05,320
I'm here to see him.

88
00:06:05,320 --> 00:06:07,320
I'm here to see him.

89
00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:09,320
I'm here to see him.

90
00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:11,320
I'm here to see him.

91
00:06:11,320 --> 00:06:13,320
I'm here to see him.

92
00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:15,320
I'm here to see him.

93
00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:17,320
I'm here to see him.

94
00:06:17,320 --> 00:06:19,320
I'm here to see him.

95
00:06:41,320 --> 00:06:42,320
You're right.

96
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:45,320
The prettier that boy, the more you trick him.

97
00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:47,320
You're obviously the one who cheated me.

98
00:06:47,320 --> 00:06:50,820
You brought a pen with you, but you didn't tell me the word.

99
00:06:50,820 --> 00:06:53,320
You're much worse than me.

100
00:06:53,320 --> 00:06:55,320
Am I worse?

101
00:07:02,820 --> 00:07:04,820
This...

102
00:07:04,820 --> 00:07:06,820
What is this?

103
00:07:06,820 --> 00:07:10,320
It's a medicine for the spine. It's called Linsan.

104
00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:14,320
White stone is white, and it can cure the disease.

105
00:07:15,320 --> 00:07:17,320
It's a medicine for the spine.

106
00:07:17,320 --> 00:07:19,320
It's a medicine for the spine.

107
00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:21,320
It's a medicine for the spine.

108
00:07:21,320 --> 00:07:23,320
It's a medicine for the spine.

109
00:07:23,320 --> 00:07:25,320
It's a medicine for the spine.

110
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:27,320
It's a medicine for the spine.

111
00:07:27,320 --> 00:07:29,320
It's a medicine for the spine.

112
00:07:29,320 --> 00:07:31,320
It's a medicine for the spine.

113
00:07:31,320 --> 00:07:33,320
It's a medicine for the spine.

114
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:35,320
It's a medicine for the spine.

115
00:07:35,320 --> 00:07:37,320
It's a medicine for the spine.

116
00:07:37,320 --> 00:07:39,320
It's a medicine for the spine.

117
00:07:39,320 --> 00:07:41,320
It's a medicine for the spine.

118
00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:43,320
It's a medicine for the spine.

119
00:07:44,320 --> 00:07:46,320
Three,

120
00:07:46,320 --> 00:07:48,320
two,

121
00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:50,320
one.

122
00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:06,320
Yong,

123
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:10,320
the Cloud Sword of the Ice Clan is in your hands.

124
00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:14,320
Lord Zuo Yi Chen, you are really not easy.

125
00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:26,320
The demon's bite has been cured by my life.

126
00:08:40,320 --> 00:09:00,720
It's my

127
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:02,320
Let ры

128
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:07,320
It's been cut.

129
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:09,320
The world is a mess.

130
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:11,320
I'm not a fool.

131
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:13,320
I'm a fool.

132
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:15,320
I'm not a fool.

133
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:17,320
I'm not a fool.

134
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:19,320
I'm not a fool.

135
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:21,320
I'm not a fool.

136
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:23,320
I'm not a fool.

137
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:25,320
I'm not a fool.

138
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:27,320
I'm not a fool.

139
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:29,320
I'm not a fool.

140
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:31,320
I'm not a fool.

141
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:33,320
I'm not a fool.

142
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:35,320
I'm not a fool.

143
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:38,320
You have been in the Jiao Si Sect for eight years.

144
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:40,320
You have been in the Jiao Si Sect for eight years.

145
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:42,320
You have been in the Wuding Sect for eight years.

146
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:45,320
You have finally got a chance to meet again.

147
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:48,320
I especially admire you.

148
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:51,320
Lord Zhuo is very generous.

149
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:55,320
Zhu Yan.

150
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:58,320
You are bad at the doorbell.

151
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:00,320
Today,

152
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:03,320
I will kill you to revenge.

153
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:06,320
If you want to kill me,

154
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:09,320
you can't kill me with a sword.

155
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:17,320
Fire.

156
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:35,320
Fire.

157
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:05,320
Fire.

158
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:29,320
The world is hard.

159
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:36,320
The world is hard.

160
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:38,320
But probably it is.

161
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:39,820
But probably

162
00:11:39,820 --> 00:11:42,320
I am the strongest one.

163
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:49,320
Can't even defeat Texan?

164
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:56,120
Well,

165
00:11:56,120 --> 00:11:59,320
things are all true.

166
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:01,320
Of course, it's true.

167
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:03,320
Of course you are not a monster.

168
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:07,320
You are a white monkey.

169
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:09,320
White monkey.

170
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:11,320
White monkey.

171
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:17,320
Monkey.

172
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:19,320
I am a monkey.

173
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:27,320
You are a person of the pet parrot?

174
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:29,320
How could a person of the pet parrot

175
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:31,320
be a pet parrot?

176
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:33,320
I am just interested in monsters.

177
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:37,320
You are not afraid of monsters?

178
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:39,320
You always love to lie.

179
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:41,320
What is the worst thing about me, Wen Xiao?

180
00:12:45,320 --> 00:12:47,320
You are Wen Xiao?

181
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:53,320
I am indeed very smart in monsters.

182
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:55,320
No, no, no. You are just a little girl

183
00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:57,320
who is not good at math.

184
00:12:57,320 --> 00:12:59,320
No one knows you.

185
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:03,320
You are a little girl.

186
00:13:03,320 --> 00:13:05,320
You know me?

187
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:07,320
A beast is weak in its skin and can be seen through its face.

188
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:09,320
It is easy to see through its eyes and is easy to see through its eyes.

189
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:11,320
It is easy to see through its eyes and is easy to see through its eyes.

190
00:13:11,320 --> 00:13:13,320
You are the one who is the best at lying.

191
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:15,320
That is right, right?

192
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:17,320
That is wrong.

193
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:21,320
Although a beast is not a murderer.

194
00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:23,320
Then why did you catch me?

195
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:25,320
Although a beast is not a murderer.

196
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:27,320
But you are a murderer.

197
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:29,320
You should be caught to make people calm.

198
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:35,320
Half a year ago, you pretended to be a merchant

199
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:37,320
and stole the ten taels of gold from the owner of the rice shop.

200
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:39,320
The ten taels of gold, I will take it first.

201
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:43,320
You take a look.

202
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:45,320
Keep it well.

203
00:13:45,320 --> 00:13:47,320
The goods of the corn are still there for an hour.

204
00:13:47,320 --> 00:13:49,320
I wish you wealth.

205
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:51,320
One month ago,

206
00:13:51,320 --> 00:13:53,320
you lied again.

207
00:13:53,320 --> 00:13:55,320
The truth of the truth of the prince's wealth.

208
00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:01,320
Mr. Wang,

209
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:03,320
let me try your cooking

210
00:14:03,320 --> 00:14:05,320
for you this life.

211
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:07,320
It is delicious.

212
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:09,320
It is delicious.

213
00:14:09,320 --> 00:14:11,320
It is delicious.

214
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:15,320
Do you want to add some more?

215
00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:17,320
Do you want to add more?

216
00:14:17,320 --> 00:14:19,320
Do you know

217
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:21,320
the meaning of the month?

218
00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:29,320
Now Mr. Zhang is in a bad mood.

219
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:31,320
His wife suspect that he took money

220
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:33,320
to raise women outside.

221
00:14:33,320 --> 00:14:35,320
He can only choose to take a look.

222
00:14:35,320 --> 00:14:37,320
Where are you going?

223
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:39,320
Don't look at me.

224
00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:41,320
I am going to take a look.

225
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:43,320
The prince's wealth

226
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:45,320
is not yours.

227
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:47,320
You are not worthy of it.

228
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:49,320
You are in tears in the middle of the day.

229
00:14:53,320 --> 00:14:55,320
I am a man of the past.

230
00:14:55,320 --> 00:14:57,320
I am a man of the past.

231
00:14:57,320 --> 00:14:59,320
Xiao'e,

232
00:14:59,320 --> 00:15:01,320
you are really good.

233
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:03,320
Don't listen to me.

234
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:05,320
Mr. Zhang is a great man

235
00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:07,320
who is ten taels of gold.

236
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:09,320
I heard that he is not well-received this year.

237
00:15:09,320 --> 00:15:11,320
He spent a lot of money

238
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:13,320
to gather all the rice grains in the forest.

239
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:15,320
He said that

240
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:17,320
rice grains are scarce.

241
00:15:17,320 --> 00:15:19,320
It is good to make more people eat.

242
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:21,320
How could I lie to him?

243
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:23,320
It is good to lie to a good person.

244
00:15:31,320 --> 00:15:33,320
It is raining and it is raining.

245
00:15:33,320 --> 00:15:35,320
Why did you take the umbrella?

246
00:15:35,320 --> 00:15:37,320
I understand.

247
00:15:37,320 --> 00:15:39,320
I understand.

248
00:15:39,320 --> 00:15:41,320
I understand.

249
00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:45,320
Mr. Zhang is a man of the past.

250
00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:47,320
He is a man of the past.

251
00:15:47,320 --> 00:15:49,320
He is a man of the past.

252
00:15:53,320 --> 00:15:55,320
Where is the wealth?

253
00:15:55,320 --> 00:15:57,320
Mr. Wang

254
00:15:57,320 --> 00:15:59,320
is talented

255
00:15:59,320 --> 00:16:01,320
and has a good sense of humor.

256
00:16:01,320 --> 00:16:03,320
He is a rich lady.

257
00:16:03,320 --> 00:16:05,320
No one is willing to help him.

258
00:16:05,320 --> 00:16:07,320
Mr. Wang

259
00:16:07,320 --> 00:16:09,320
is a man of the past.

260
00:16:09,320 --> 00:16:11,320
He abandoned his lover for me.

261
00:16:11,320 --> 00:16:13,320
I understand.

262
00:16:13,320 --> 00:16:15,320
Mr. Wang is a man of the past.

263
00:16:15,320 --> 00:16:17,320
He is a man of the past.

264
00:16:17,320 --> 00:16:19,320
He is a man of the past.

265
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:21,320
What?

266
00:16:21,320 --> 00:16:23,320
We are both rich.

267
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:27,320
You two are so pretentious.

268
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:29,320
Let's go.

269
00:16:29,320 --> 00:16:31,320
I really didn't do anything bad.

270
00:16:31,320 --> 00:16:33,320
You know it very well.

271
00:16:33,320 --> 00:16:35,320
It is bad.

272
00:16:35,320 --> 00:16:37,320
He is a man of the past.

273
00:16:37,320 --> 00:16:39,320
He is a man of the past.

274
00:16:39,320 --> 00:16:41,320
He has a good sense of humor.

275
00:16:41,320 --> 00:16:43,320
You are a man of the past.

276
00:16:43,320 --> 00:16:45,320
You are a man of the past.

277
00:16:45,320 --> 00:16:47,320
But you are a man of the past.

278
00:16:47,320 --> 00:16:49,320
You should be punished.

279
00:16:51,320 --> 00:16:53,320
Don't worry.

280
00:16:53,320 --> 00:16:55,320
It is not a big deal.

281
00:16:55,320 --> 00:16:57,320
I will send you back to Da Huang in a few months.

282
00:16:59,320 --> 00:17:01,320
Why are you so nervous?

283
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:03,320
No, sister.

284
00:17:03,320 --> 00:17:05,320
Look.

285
00:17:09,320 --> 00:17:11,320
The one who won the game is here.

286
00:17:17,320 --> 00:17:19,320
Give me the beast.

287
00:17:19,320 --> 00:17:21,320
I am the commander of Ji Yaosu.

288
00:17:21,320 --> 00:17:23,320
I have the right to take the beast back to Ji Yaosu.

289
00:17:25,320 --> 00:17:27,320
Ji Yaosu?

290
00:17:27,320 --> 00:17:29,320
Your Qingtai and Zhu Si of the yard

291
00:17:29,320 --> 00:17:31,320
are all very thick.

292
00:17:31,320 --> 00:17:33,320
They are all dead.

293
00:17:33,320 --> 00:17:35,320
They dare to fight me.

294
00:17:35,320 --> 00:17:37,320
They won't let me go.

295
00:17:39,320 --> 00:17:41,320
You are weak and you are powerful.

296
00:17:41,320 --> 00:17:43,320
You are a man of the past.

297
00:17:43,320 --> 00:17:45,320
You are a man of the past.

298
00:17:45,320 --> 00:17:47,320
You are a man of the past.

299
00:17:47,320 --> 00:17:49,320
But you are a man of the past.

300
00:17:49,320 --> 00:17:51,320
You have been saved by a demon.

301
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:53,320
So you have been soft to the demon.

302
00:17:53,320 --> 00:17:55,320
You have been a demon for many years.

303
00:17:55,320 --> 00:17:57,320
But eight years ago,

304
00:17:57,320 --> 00:17:59,320
the evil demon Zhu Yan

305
00:17:59,320 --> 00:18:01,320
made you all the dead.

306
00:18:01,320 --> 00:18:03,320
Ji Yaosu was killed.

307
00:18:03,320 --> 00:18:05,320
Ji Jing was killed.

308
00:18:05,320 --> 00:18:07,320
If he is here,

309
00:18:07,320 --> 00:18:09,320
you will also beg for his mercy.

310
00:18:11,320 --> 00:18:13,320
The words of the murderer

311
00:18:13,320 --> 00:18:15,320
are absolutely heartless.

312
00:18:17,320 --> 00:18:19,320
Today,

313
00:18:19,320 --> 00:18:21,320
I will definitely kill you.

314
00:18:25,320 --> 00:18:27,320
I am done with my patience.

315
00:18:27,320 --> 00:18:29,320
I have already used it.

316
00:18:29,320 --> 00:18:31,320
If not for the fact that

317
00:18:31,320 --> 00:18:33,320
Lord Fan appeared just now.

318
00:18:43,320 --> 00:18:45,320
You can do it.

319
00:18:45,320 --> 00:18:47,320
But all the guards here

320
00:18:51,320 --> 00:18:53,320
four on the roof.

321
00:18:53,320 --> 00:18:55,320
Seven on the back.

322
00:18:57,320 --> 00:18:59,320
Five on the side.

323
00:19:01,320 --> 00:19:03,320
16 people in total.

324
00:19:03,320 --> 00:19:05,320
They will all be buried for me.

325
00:19:07,320 --> 00:19:09,320
I will die for you.

326
00:19:13,320 --> 00:19:15,320
Like this.

327
00:19:23,320 --> 00:19:25,320
The demon Zhu Yan killed people to do evil.

328
00:19:25,320 --> 00:19:27,320
But the petal is already killed.

329
00:19:27,320 --> 00:19:29,320
What difference does Zhu Yan have?

330
00:19:29,320 --> 00:19:31,320
What nonsense?

331
00:19:31,320 --> 00:19:33,320
Kill them!

332
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:56,320
Sister.

333
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:58,320
Are you still acting at this time?

334
00:19:59,320 --> 00:20:01,320
I am not acting.

335
00:20:01,320 --> 00:20:03,320
Are you okay?

336
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:06,320
Let's go.

337
00:20:11,320 --> 00:20:13,320
Let's go.

338
00:20:13,320 --> 00:20:15,320
Let's go.

339
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:26,320
Let's go.

340
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:30,320
Let's go.

341
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:56,320
The demon Zhu Yan killed people to do evil.

342
00:20:56,320 --> 00:20:58,320
How can he kill people to do evil?

343
00:20:58,320 --> 00:21:00,320
I am not acting.

344
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:02,320
I will die for you.

345
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:04,320
I will die for you.

346
00:21:05,320 --> 00:21:07,320
Sister.

347
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:12,320
Thank you.

348
00:21:23,320 --> 00:21:27,320
Are you blaming me?

349
00:21:35,320 --> 00:21:38,320
I'm really blaming you.

350
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:42,320
I'm sorry.

351
00:21:43,320 --> 00:21:46,320
I'm the one who's not here anymore.

352
00:21:47,320 --> 00:21:54,320
Why am I telling everyone?

353
00:21:55,320 --> 00:21:59,320
The day is over, it's about time we met

354
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:03,320
What kind of words are they?

355
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:09,520
Are they words that can't hurt you?

356
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:14,520
I don't want to say I'm not afraid

357
00:22:16,520 --> 00:22:19,520
The war of the past is lost

358
00:22:20,520 --> 00:22:22,520
The day of the dream is over

359
00:22:22,520 --> 00:22:27,520
The war of yesterday is in the eyes

360
00:22:28,520 --> 00:22:32,520
The people in the dream are silent

361
00:22:32,520 --> 00:22:34,520
One step at a time

362
00:22:34,520 --> 00:22:39,520
I can't leave or turn around

363
00:22:40,520 --> 00:22:46,520
There are too many stars in the wind and wind

364
00:22:46,520 --> 00:22:51,520
There is a blank location

365
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:59,520
The white clouds are enough to see the pain

366
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:04,520
A pair of hands and a cup of wine

367
00:23:06,520 --> 00:23:07,520
I count to three

368
00:23:08,520 --> 00:23:10,520
You can't take it

369
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:14,520
Three

370
00:23:18,520 --> 00:23:19,520
Two

371
00:23:24,520 --> 00:23:25,520
One

372
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:30,520
Three

373
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:40,520
Is it hard?

374
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:43,520
It's right to be sad

375
00:23:44,520 --> 00:23:48,520
This world is not easy

376
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:51,520
Ten to eight

377
00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:54,520
Lord Zhuo

378
00:23:55,520 --> 00:24:00,520
You are used to being laughed at

379
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:08,520
One day I will use the Cloud Palace to kill you

380
00:24:08,520 --> 00:24:09,520
Go

381
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:21,520
Like this

382
00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:25,520
I told you just now

383
00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:28,520
You

384
00:24:30,520 --> 00:24:32,520
Can't kill me

385
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:40,520
Lord Zhuo, are we more sad?

386
00:24:44,520 --> 00:24:47,520
Lord Zhuo, the big picture is the end

387
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:53,520
Lord Zhuo, what do you mean?

388
00:25:03,520 --> 00:25:06,520
Archangel Chang

389
00:25:10,520 --> 00:25:31,100
Your деревeless spirit summons her in this

390
00:25:32,520 --> 00:25:34,520
What gift?

391
00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:38,520
I...

392
00:25:40,520 --> 00:25:42,520
...will take Zhu Yan's medicine

393
00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:45,520
and return it to the court

394
00:25:46,520 --> 00:25:48,520
to reward you.

395
00:25:52,520 --> 00:25:53,520
This gift...

396
00:25:55,520 --> 00:25:56,520
Lord Zhu,

397
00:25:57,520 --> 00:25:59,520
are you satisfied?

398
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:01,520
Are you not satisfied?

399
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:04,520
Not yet.

400
00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:09,520
Lord Zhu is really greedy.

401
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:15,520
How can you make Lord Zhu satisfied?

402
00:26:16,520 --> 00:26:18,520
Are you satisfied now?

403
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:21,520
I'll kill you sooner or later.

404
00:26:26,520 --> 00:26:29,520
I hope Lord Zhu can speak properly.

405
00:26:32,520 --> 00:26:33,520
Lord Zhu,

406
00:26:34,520 --> 00:26:36,520
I'm finally back.

407
00:26:36,520 --> 00:26:38,520
Why are you so pale?

408
00:26:38,520 --> 00:26:39,520
Is there anything wrong?

409
00:26:40,520 --> 00:26:42,520
There's a...a demon.

410
00:26:43,520 --> 00:26:44,520
A demon?

411
00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:49,520
There's a demon in the Jiao Temple.

412
00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:51,520
Then the demon must be too bold.

413
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:53,520
He's not only bold,

414
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:55,520
but also a man who can't be seen.

415
00:26:56,520 --> 00:26:58,520
He's also a man who can't be seen.

416
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:00,520
I'm sorry.

417
00:27:00,520 --> 00:27:02,520
He's not only bold,

418
00:27:02,520 --> 00:27:04,520
but also a man who can't be seen.

419
00:27:04,520 --> 00:27:06,520
He's even a man who can't be seen.

420
00:27:08,520 --> 00:27:09,520
What demon?

421
00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:11,520
I don't know.

422
00:27:11,520 --> 00:27:13,520
But I heard Lord Zhu call him...

423
00:27:14,520 --> 00:27:15,520
...and...

424
00:27:16,520 --> 00:27:18,520
...and asked him to go out.

425
00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:33,520
The Demon of the Sky

426
00:27:43,520 --> 00:27:46,520
It's famous for its ability to be discovered.

427
00:27:46,520 --> 00:27:48,520
It's the man of the sky.

428
00:27:48,520 --> 00:27:51,520
Zhao Yanzhou, 29 years old.

429
00:27:51,520 --> 00:27:53,520
He's really a demon?

430
00:27:53,520 --> 00:27:54,520
A demon of the emergency.

431
00:27:54,520 --> 00:27:57,520
He's a man who can't be seen.

432
00:27:57,520 --> 00:27:59,520
Not a man.

433
00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:01,520
Why didn't you kill...

434
00:28:01,520 --> 00:28:03,520
...Lin Guangqian?

435
00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:05,520
I don't know.

436
00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:07,520
You want to know?

437
00:28:10,520 --> 00:28:12,520
You're talking to us.

438
00:28:12,520 --> 00:28:14,520
You're so mean.

439
00:28:14,520 --> 00:28:16,520
You're talking to us?

440
00:28:16,520 --> 00:28:18,520
I didn't even move.

441
00:28:18,520 --> 00:28:20,520
I was in a low voice with Fan.

442
00:28:20,520 --> 00:28:22,520
You heard it.

443
00:28:22,520 --> 00:28:24,520
You're not a monkey.

444
00:28:24,520 --> 00:28:25,520
You're a dog.

445
00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:27,520
A dog's nose is more flexible.

446
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:28,520
You...

447
00:28:28,520 --> 00:28:30,520
Lord Zhu, don't forget.

448
00:28:30,520 --> 00:28:32,520
I'm a thousand-year-old demon.

449
00:28:32,520 --> 00:28:34,520
I dare not copy.

450
00:28:34,520 --> 00:28:36,520
No matter how far you stand...

451
00:28:36,520 --> 00:28:39,520
...for me, it's like...

452
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:43,520
...I'm afraid of being attacked by my ears.

453
00:28:43,520 --> 00:28:44,520
How dare you!

454
00:28:44,520 --> 00:28:46,520
Who's attacked by your ears?

455
00:28:48,520 --> 00:28:50,520
Do you want to know the answer?

456
00:28:50,520 --> 00:28:52,520
You're so mean.

457
00:28:52,520 --> 00:28:54,520
You're so mean.

458
00:28:55,520 --> 00:28:57,520
Just say it.

459
00:28:58,520 --> 00:29:00,520
You're the descendant of the Ice Tribe.

460
00:29:02,520 --> 00:29:04,520
Since ancient times, the bloodline of the Ice Tribe...

461
00:29:04,520 --> 00:29:07,520
...has been the core of the Demon Tribe.

462
00:29:07,520 --> 00:29:09,520
The power of the Cloud Sword...

463
00:29:09,520 --> 00:29:12,520
...is more powerful than the magic of the Immortal God.

464
00:29:12,520 --> 00:29:14,520
But...

465
00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:19,520
But what?

466
00:29:20,520 --> 00:29:22,520
Your method is wrong.

467
00:29:25,520 --> 00:29:27,520
How?

468
00:29:27,520 --> 00:29:29,520
This is the highest secret of the Ice Tribe.

469
00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:32,520
Lord Zhu must be very careful.

470
00:29:32,520 --> 00:29:35,520
He must not be heard by outsiders.

471
00:29:39,520 --> 00:29:41,520
What a pity.

472
00:29:42,520 --> 00:29:44,520
Tell me.

473
00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:48,520
It's my fault that I didn't get hurt.

474
00:29:48,520 --> 00:29:50,520
Zhao Yanzhou, you said that...

475
00:29:50,520 --> 00:29:52,520
...you could help the Demon Division...

476
00:29:52,520 --> 00:29:56,520
...to break through the murder case in Tiandu City.

477
00:29:56,520 --> 00:29:58,520
I'm sorry.

478
00:29:58,520 --> 00:30:01,520
Why would you help the Demon Division?

479
00:30:01,520 --> 00:30:03,520
You must have a reason.

480
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:05,520
I have no reason.

481
00:30:05,520 --> 00:30:08,520
I really want to help the Demon Division.

482
00:30:08,520 --> 00:30:12,520
I've been a Demon Warrior for years.

483
00:30:12,520 --> 00:30:14,520
I'm a Demon Warrior.

484
00:30:14,520 --> 00:30:17,520
I help the Demon Division.

485
00:30:17,520 --> 00:30:20,520
The enemy is my friend.

486
00:30:20,520 --> 00:30:23,520
You're right.

487
00:30:26,520 --> 00:30:28,520
Eight years ago,

488
00:30:28,520 --> 00:30:30,520
the Demon Division was destroyed.

489
00:30:30,520 --> 00:30:33,520
The Chongwu Camp was destroyed.

490
00:30:34,520 --> 00:30:37,520
It was all your fault.

491
00:30:39,520 --> 00:30:44,520
I must help the blood and blood of the murderous father.

492
00:30:45,520 --> 00:30:48,520
No one can help the Demon Division.

493
00:30:50,520 --> 00:30:53,520
You can't do that.

494
00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:56,520
Is there a saying that...

495
00:30:56,520 --> 00:31:01,520
...you can't change the name of the crime?

496
00:31:04,520 --> 00:31:07,520
Do you really want to help the Demon Division?

497
00:31:08,520 --> 00:31:13,520
I'll do my best to help.

498
00:31:14,520 --> 00:31:16,520
But I have a condition.

499
00:31:17,520 --> 00:31:20,520
You just said that you're innocent.

500
00:31:20,520 --> 00:31:22,520
I'm not lying.

501
00:31:22,520 --> 00:31:24,520
What condition?

502
00:31:26,520 --> 00:31:29,520
I want to give someone in the temple...

503
00:31:29,520 --> 00:31:32,520
...to investigate with me.

504
00:31:33,520 --> 00:31:35,520
Who?

505
00:31:36,520 --> 00:31:38,520
You know each other.

506
00:31:38,520 --> 00:31:42,520
You're the only one who can help Master Ying.

507
00:31:44,520 --> 00:31:46,520
Miss Wenxiao.

508
00:31:47,520 --> 00:31:49,520
Master Zhuo, you're ordered.

509
00:31:49,520 --> 00:31:51,520
No one can approach the dungeon.

510
00:31:51,520 --> 00:31:53,520
I can't do that.

511
00:31:53,520 --> 00:31:56,520
Master Wen, you can't do that either.

512
00:31:58,520 --> 00:31:59,520
Stop thinking!

513
00:31:59,520 --> 00:32:01,520
Stop thinking.

514
00:32:01,520 --> 00:32:03,520
I'm not only thinking.

515
00:32:03,520 --> 00:32:06,520
I have to do it.

516
00:32:07,520 --> 00:32:10,520
It's my request now.

517
00:32:11,520 --> 00:32:14,520
You're not qualified to say no.

518
00:32:16,520 --> 00:32:19,520
Go!

519
00:32:47,520 --> 00:32:49,520
Master.

520
00:32:58,520 --> 00:33:00,520
Master.

521
00:33:01,520 --> 00:33:03,520
Master!

522
00:33:16,520 --> 00:33:18,520
Master.

523
00:33:24,520 --> 00:33:26,520
Master.

524
00:33:26,520 --> 00:33:28,520
Master.

525
00:33:42,520 --> 00:33:45,520
Do you like the sword?

526
00:33:49,520 --> 00:33:51,520
Master!

527
00:33:51,520 --> 00:33:53,520
Master!

528
00:33:56,520 --> 00:33:58,520
Master!

529
00:33:58,520 --> 00:34:00,520
Master!

530
00:34:00,520 --> 00:34:02,520
Master!

531
00:34:02,520 --> 00:34:04,520
Master!

532
00:34:04,520 --> 00:34:06,520
Master!

533
00:34:06,520 --> 00:34:08,520
Master!

534
00:34:08,520 --> 00:34:10,520
Master!

535
00:34:10,520 --> 00:34:12,520
Master!

536
00:34:12,520 --> 00:34:14,520
Master!

537
00:34:14,520 --> 00:34:16,520
Master!

538
00:34:16,520 --> 00:34:18,520
Master!

539
00:34:18,520 --> 00:34:20,520
Master!

540
00:34:20,520 --> 00:34:22,520
Master!

541
00:34:22,520 --> 00:34:24,520
Master!

542
00:34:25,520 --> 00:34:28,520
Why is there blood on the top?

543
00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:38,520
Is it Master's heart?

544
00:34:38,520 --> 00:34:40,520
Master!

545
00:34:53,520 --> 00:34:56,520
You're so active.

546
00:34:58,520 --> 00:35:00,520
You're weak.

547
00:35:00,520 --> 00:35:02,520
You fell.

548
00:35:02,520 --> 00:35:04,520
Don't be so weird.

549
00:35:04,520 --> 00:35:06,520
Aren't you afraid of me?

550
00:35:06,520 --> 00:35:08,520
I'm a demon.

551
00:35:10,520 --> 00:35:12,520
I know.

552
00:35:12,520 --> 00:35:14,520
A demon, a pig.

553
00:35:18,520 --> 00:35:20,520
You look very familiar.

554
00:35:20,520 --> 00:35:23,520
Have we met before?

555
00:35:24,520 --> 00:35:26,520
You're so old.

556
00:35:26,520 --> 00:35:28,520
Are you serious?

557
00:35:30,520 --> 00:35:32,520
Hello.

558
00:35:32,520 --> 00:35:34,520
I'm Wenxiang.

559
00:35:34,520 --> 00:35:36,520
I'm Zhao Yanzhou.

560
00:35:36,520 --> 00:35:38,520
Hello.

561
00:35:38,520 --> 00:35:40,520
I'm Zhao Yanzhou.

562
00:35:42,520 --> 00:35:44,520
I didn't expect you to have a name.

563
00:35:46,520 --> 00:35:48,520
I have a rabbit and a shawl.

564
00:35:48,520 --> 00:35:50,520
I'm a demon.

565
00:35:50,520 --> 00:35:52,520
I have a few beautiful things to do.

566
00:35:52,520 --> 00:35:54,520
Lord Zhao Yanzhou.

567
00:35:54,520 --> 00:35:56,520
My legs are not soft.

568
00:35:56,520 --> 00:35:58,520
You can help me up.

569
00:35:58,520 --> 00:36:00,520
Okay.

570
00:36:00,520 --> 00:36:02,520
Master!

571
00:36:02,520 --> 00:36:04,520
Let her go!

572
00:36:10,520 --> 00:36:12,520
Did you hear that?

573
00:36:12,520 --> 00:36:14,520
He wants you to let me go.

574
00:36:14,520 --> 00:36:16,520
Don't think.

575
00:36:16,520 --> 00:36:18,520
Lord Zhao's light sword can't kill me.

576
00:36:18,520 --> 00:36:20,520
You little bastard.

577
00:36:26,520 --> 00:36:28,520
You won't die, but you'll be hurt.

578
00:36:28,520 --> 00:36:30,520
You won't die, right?

579
00:36:32,520 --> 00:36:34,520
Then I will...

580
00:36:38,520 --> 00:36:40,520
What did you put on the sword?

581
00:36:40,520 --> 00:36:42,520
Demon, demon, demon.

582
00:36:42,520 --> 00:36:44,520
The spirit of the spirit.

583
00:36:44,520 --> 00:36:46,520
The spirit of the spirit.

584
00:36:46,520 --> 00:36:48,520
Your flowers are beautiful.

585
00:36:48,520 --> 00:36:50,520
I'll take it.

586
00:36:54,520 --> 00:36:56,520
The spirit of the spirit can't live long.

587
00:36:56,520 --> 00:36:58,520
Go back to the dungeon.

588
00:37:00,520 --> 00:37:02,520
I can't keep her in the dungeon.

589
00:37:06,520 --> 00:37:08,520
She just came out from there.

590
00:37:10,520 --> 00:37:12,520
Really?

591
00:37:18,520 --> 00:37:20,520
Then use the knife.

592
00:37:20,520 --> 00:37:22,520
Don't, don't, don't.

593
00:37:22,520 --> 00:37:24,520
I'll go back.

594
00:37:24,520 --> 00:37:26,520
I'll go back myself.

595
00:37:26,520 --> 00:37:28,520
Thank you.

596
00:37:32,520 --> 00:37:34,520
I'll go back myself. Thank you.

597
00:37:44,520 --> 00:37:46,520
Lord Wen.

598
00:37:46,520 --> 00:37:48,520
This is the monster test we found.

599
00:37:48,520 --> 00:37:50,520
The data is here.

600
00:37:54,520 --> 00:37:56,520
Go back.

601
00:37:56,520 --> 00:37:58,520
Go back.

602
00:37:58,520 --> 00:38:00,520
Lord Wen, your wound...

603
00:38:00,520 --> 00:38:02,520
It's okay.

604
00:38:24,520 --> 00:38:26,520
The mirror is blind.

605
00:38:26,520 --> 00:38:28,520
The fire is deep.

606
00:38:30,520 --> 00:38:32,520
The teacher's painting is very similar to the painting of Zhu Rong Tu.

607
00:38:34,520 --> 00:38:36,520
I'm usually...

608
00:38:36,520 --> 00:38:38,520
The painting is in the color of the sky.

609
00:38:42,520 --> 00:38:44,520
The fire is blind.

610
00:38:46,520 --> 00:38:48,520
The fire is deep.

611
00:38:50,520 --> 00:38:52,520
The fire is deep.

612
00:38:54,520 --> 00:38:56,520
It's really blind.

613
00:39:00,520 --> 00:39:02,520
You said they caught Zhu Yan.

614
00:39:02,520 --> 00:39:04,520
Zhu Yan is a big monster.

615
00:39:04,520 --> 00:39:08,520
If he really wants to fight us.

616
00:39:10,520 --> 00:39:12,520
Don't worry.

617
00:39:12,520 --> 00:39:14,520
The color of the glue is not enough.

618
00:39:14,520 --> 00:39:16,520
It's just a layer of glue.

619
00:39:16,520 --> 00:39:18,520
I want it just for Zhao Yanzhou.

620
00:39:18,520 --> 00:39:20,520
Since he personally sent it to me.

621
00:39:20,520 --> 00:39:22,520
I don't think that the red soil is too big.

622
00:39:24,520 --> 00:39:26,520
It can be easily broken.

623
00:39:32,520 --> 00:39:34,520
I was born with a strong body.

624
00:39:36,520 --> 00:39:38,520
I can speak the face.

625
00:39:38,520 --> 00:39:40,520
Speak the East and the West.

626
00:39:40,520 --> 00:39:42,520
Speak the evil and the good.

627
00:39:42,520 --> 00:39:44,520
When I was born.

628
00:39:44,520 --> 00:39:46,520
I was destined not to be in the dark.

629
00:39:46,520 --> 00:39:48,520
I was in the heart.

630
00:39:50,520 --> 00:39:52,520
Sister.

631
00:39:52,520 --> 00:39:54,520
Thank you.

632
00:40:00,520 --> 00:40:02,520
I said that in my life.

633
00:40:02,520 --> 00:40:04,520
I was in the world.

634
00:40:06,520 --> 00:40:08,520
But I was destined not to be in the dark.

635
00:40:14,520 --> 00:40:16,520
As a monster.

636
00:40:16,520 --> 00:40:18,520
I was destined not to be in the dark.

637
00:40:18,520 --> 00:40:20,520
I was in the heart.

638
00:40:20,520 --> 00:40:22,520
I can only respect the truth.

639
00:40:22,520 --> 00:40:24,520
Before I die.

640
00:40:24,520 --> 00:40:26,520
Speak the truth.

641
00:40:32,520 --> 00:40:34,520
Go.

642
00:40:34,520 --> 00:40:36,520
So sister.

643
00:40:38,520 --> 00:40:40,520
I thank you.

644
00:40:42,520 --> 00:40:44,520
I truly believe.

645
00:40:48,520 --> 00:40:50,520
I will never turn around.

646
00:40:52,520 --> 00:40:54,520
I am in love.

647
00:40:54,520 --> 00:40:58,520
There are many stories on the island.

648
00:40:58,520 --> 00:41:02,520
There is a name in his heart.

649
00:41:04,520 --> 00:41:08,520
The world is more than a half.

650
00:41:08,520 --> 00:41:10,520
Love and fantasy are wrong.

651
00:41:10,520 --> 00:41:12,520
I can't write it.

652
00:41:12,520 --> 00:41:14,520
I can't write it.

653
00:41:14,520 --> 00:41:16,520
This is the past.

654
00:41:18,520 --> 00:41:20,520
I can't write it.

655
00:41:20,520 --> 00:41:22,520
I can't write it.

656
00:41:22,520 --> 00:41:24,520
