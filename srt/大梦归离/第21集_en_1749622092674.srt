00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:29,320
CS

2
00:00:59,320 --> 00:01:04,320
I'm sorry, but I'm not sure if I can get the money back.

3
00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:09,320
I'm sorry, but I'm not sure if I can get the money back.

4
00:01:09,320 --> 00:01:14,320
I'm sorry, but I'm not sure if I can get the money back.

5
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:19,320
I'm sorry, but I'm not sure if I can get the money back.

6
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:24,320
I'm sorry, but I'm not sure if I can get the money back.

7
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:30,320
I'm sorry, but I'm not sure if I can get the money back.

8
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:37,320
I'm sorry, but I'm not sure if I can get the money back.

9
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:41,500
Since then, displacement has become a curse.

10
00:01:41,500 --> 00:01:46,500
Thank you for watching!

11
00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:13,500
So you want to catch Zhao Yanzhou?

12
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:15,500
I didn't expect him to have unexpected life.

13
00:02:20,500 --> 00:02:21,500
Zhao Yanzhou,

14
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:23,500
wherever you hide,

15
00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:24,500
you always have to be carefree.

16
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:26,500
You are too small-minded

17
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:29,500
to chase after the tree of the demon.

18
00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:34,500
You are so small-minded.

19
00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:36,500
You are so small-minded.

20
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:39,500
You are so small-minded.

21
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:41,500
Indeed,

22
00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:43,500
you are real dogs.

23
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:50,500
You are still a snake.

24
00:02:56,500 --> 00:02:58,500
You are so messy.

25
00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:01,500
Stop, master.

26
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:02,500
Chuchu.

27
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:04,500
I won't let you hurt my friends.

28
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:10,500
Chuchu.

29
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:21,500
Bai Jiao.

30
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:24,500
You even called me master.

31
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:26,500
Shouldn't you

32
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:27,500
repay the debt

33
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:28,500
that you have taken

34
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:30,500
from Zhao Yanzhou?

35
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:32,500
What should I repay?

36
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:34,500
I should repay you first.

37
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:35,500
Wait.

38
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:38,500
Who is the most difficult

39
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:40,500
to help you when you are in trouble?

40
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:42,500
Who took you

41
00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:43,500
to teach you art?

42
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:47,500
Do you want to avenge me?

43
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:50,500
Jiao Jiao,

44
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:51,500
don't worry.

45
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:52,500
He taught you those things

46
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:55,500
just to use you to hurt people.

47
00:03:56,500 --> 00:03:57,500
That's right.

48
00:03:58,500 --> 00:03:59,500
Some mistakes

49
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:01,500
need to be made up

50
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:02,500
and made up by yourself.

51
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:05,500
I won't be in the mirror.

52
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:06,500
Before,

53
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:09,500
I hurt and cheated my friends.

54
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:11,500
I will try my best

55
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:12,500
to make up for it.

56
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:18,500
Don't write.

57
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:19,500
Give me the money.

58
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:22,500
What do you want to do?

59
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:37,500
Jiao Jiao.

60
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:38,500
Jiao Jiao.

61
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:39,500
Don't hurt yourself.

62
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:46,500
Isn't Bai Jiao

63
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:47,500
the most timid and afraid of pain?

64
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:49,500
I...

65
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:50,500
I am timid.

66
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:53,500
I am also afraid of pain.

67
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:56,500
I am timid.

68
00:04:57,500 --> 00:04:58,500
I am timid.

69
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:00,500
I am timid.

70
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:03,500
I am timid.

71
00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:07,500
I am afraid of losing you.

72
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:19,500
From now on,

73
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:21,500
I will never be the winner.

74
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:23,500
I will never let you

75
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:24,500
be the loser.

76
00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:25,500
Enough.

77
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:29,500
Since this is your decision,

78
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:33,500
don't blame me for being timid.

79
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:36,500
I will never let you be the loser.

80
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:38,500
I will never let you be the loser.

81
00:05:56,500 --> 00:05:57,500
Fang Zi.

82
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:06,500
Fang Zi.

83
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:37,500
Fang Zi.

84
00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:42,500
If you don't kill me,

85
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:43,500
who will kill you?

86
00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:45,500
Jiao Jiao.

87
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:47,500
I will find a way.

88
00:07:05,500 --> 00:07:07,500
Your magic

89
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:09,500
is useless to all the heroes and swords.

90
00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:13,500
I am a special swordsman.

91
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:14,500
I am a special swordsman.

92
00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:17,500
I can only keep it for you.

93
00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:21,500
Zhao Yuan Zhou.

94
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:24,500
Don't waste your energy on the enemy.

95
00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:25,500
Just let go of the favor.

96
00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:36,500
I will kill you.

97
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:07,500
I will kill you.

98
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:17,500
Your Majesty.

99
00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:18,500
There is a needle in the ring.

100
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:20,500
It has a big magic.

101
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:23,500
Zhao Yuan Zhou.

102
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:24,500
Now, the last step

103
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:27,500
is to seal your magic.

104
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:30,500
I only need to seal your magic

105
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:33,500
and make it work.

106
00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:34,500
Master.

107
00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:36,500
Why did you seal your magic

108
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:37,500
and make the monster

109
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:38,500
spit out the inside?

110
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:40,500
If I seal my magic,

111
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:41,500
I will become

112
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:43,500
a secret weapon.

113
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:45,500
That will be the last time.

114
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:47,500
It will be like a strong blow

115
00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:49,500
from the water.

116
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:53,500
And

117
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:56,500
Zhao Yuan Zhou's body is not light.

118
00:08:58,500 --> 00:08:59,500
After I seal my magic,

119
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:02,500
I will burn my body.

120
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:05,500
I will not let you go.

121
00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:09,500
Zhao Yuan Zhou.

122
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:11,500
The last needle is done.

123
00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:13,500
You can spit out the inside.

124
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:20,500
Zhao Yuan Zhou.

125
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:23,500
Zhao Yuan Zhou.

126
00:09:33,500 --> 00:09:34,500
Zhao Yuan Zhou.

127
00:10:03,500 --> 00:10:04,500
Zhao Yuan Zhou.

128
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:35,500
Zhao Yuan Zhou.

129
00:10:38,500 --> 00:10:39,500
Zhao Yuan Zhou.

130
00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:42,500
Zhao Yuan Zhou.

131
00:11:03,500 --> 00:11:06,500
Teacher, what's going on?

132
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:12,100
Do you want to take it down and take it back?

133
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:37,500
I'm going to take it down.

134
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:39,500
I'm going to take it back.

135
00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:41,500
I'm going to take it back.

136
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:43,500
I'm going to take it back.

137
00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:45,500
I'm going to take it back.

138
00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:47,500
I'm going to take it back.

139
00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:49,500
I'm going to take it back.

140
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:51,500
I'm going to take it back.

141
00:11:51,500 --> 00:11:53,500
I'm going to take it back.

142
00:11:53,500 --> 00:11:55,500
I'm going to take it back.

143
00:11:55,500 --> 00:11:57,500
I'm going to take it back.

144
00:11:57,500 --> 00:11:59,500
I'm going to take it back.

145
00:11:59,500 --> 00:12:01,500
I'm going to take it back.

146
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:03,500
I'm going to take it back.

147
00:12:03,500 --> 00:12:05,500
I'm going to take it back.

148
00:12:33,500 --> 00:12:35,500
I'm going to take it down.

149
00:12:54,500 --> 00:12:56,500
Let's eat.

150
00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:05,500
So light.

151
00:13:05,500 --> 00:13:07,500
I'm a woman who eats people's waist.

152
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:09,500
Fresh human meat

153
00:13:09,500 --> 00:13:12,500
is much better than big fish meat.

154
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:13,500
Cut the crap.

155
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:16,500
What kind of monster monster has never seen a spring monster?

156
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:18,500
Look at this blood-sucking talisman.

157
00:13:18,500 --> 00:13:20,500
It's for you to eat this evil monster.

158
00:13:33,500 --> 00:13:36,500
The End

159
00:13:47,500 --> 00:13:50,500
It's time to make fun of me.

160
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:55,500
Are you really not worried at all?

161
00:13:55,500 --> 00:13:57,500
No.

162
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:04,500
It's the first time in my life that I've become a slave.

163
00:14:04,500 --> 00:14:06,500
How could I not be worried?

164
00:14:09,500 --> 00:14:11,500
I'm talking about Zhao Yun Zhong.

165
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:21,500
If he's out of control here,

166
00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:24,500
this world will be over.

167
00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:27,500
Aren't you worried?

168
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:36,500
I've built a water reservoir for him.

169
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:38,500
He drank a lot.

170
00:14:38,500 --> 00:14:41,500
And he's got the magical power of the God of Yin Zhao.

171
00:14:41,500 --> 00:14:44,500
He should be able to suppress his power for the time being.

172
00:14:47,500 --> 00:14:49,500
He will choose to run away.

173
00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:54,500
He should be clear-minded and know that he can't stay.

174
00:14:56,500 --> 00:14:58,500
Where will he go?

175
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:03,500
He should go back to the Garden.

176
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:06,500
He has his own barrier.

177
00:15:06,500 --> 00:15:08,500
He can't go anywhere.

178
00:15:09,500 --> 00:15:11,500
He told me that

179
00:15:12,500 --> 00:15:17,500
if one day he feels like he's about to lose control,

180
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:19,500
he will lock himself up.

181
00:15:20,500 --> 00:15:22,500
Even if he loses control,

182
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:25,500
he won't be able to survive for now.

183
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:32,500
But this is just a temporary solution.

184
00:15:32,500 --> 00:15:34,500
So,

185
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:36,500
we still need to find the God of Yin Zhao as soon as possible

186
00:15:36,500 --> 00:15:38,500
and repair Bai Ze Ling.

187
00:15:41,500 --> 00:15:43,500
Xiao Zhu will find a way.

188
00:15:49,500 --> 00:15:51,500
Xiao Zhu will find a way.

189
00:15:51,500 --> 00:15:53,500
He will find a way.

190
00:15:53,500 --> 00:15:55,500
He will find a way.

191
00:15:55,500 --> 00:15:57,500
He will find a way.

192
00:15:57,500 --> 00:15:59,500
He will find a way.

193
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:01,500
He will find a way.

194
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:03,500
He will find a way.

195
00:16:03,500 --> 00:16:05,500
He will find a way.

196
00:16:05,500 --> 00:16:07,500
He will find a way.

197
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:09,500
He will find a way.

198
00:16:09,500 --> 00:16:11,500
He will find a way.

199
00:16:11,500 --> 00:16:13,500
He will find a way.

200
00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:15,500
He will find a way.

201
00:16:15,500 --> 00:16:17,500
He will find a way.

202
00:16:18,500 --> 00:16:20,500
He will find a way.

203
00:16:38,500 --> 00:16:41,500
Why do you still have to struggle?

204
00:16:42,500 --> 00:16:46,500
This is the strongest power in the world.

205
00:16:47,500 --> 00:16:49,500
You can destroy the world.

206
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:51,500
You can destroy the world.

207
00:16:51,500 --> 00:16:53,500
You can't do anything.

208
00:16:53,500 --> 00:16:55,500
You can't do anything.

209
00:16:55,500 --> 00:16:57,500
Why do you refuse?

210
00:17:00,500 --> 00:17:04,500
Because I don't want to destroy the world at all.

211
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:09,500
No matter what you want,

212
00:17:09,500 --> 00:17:16,500
the power that I want to use can be done for you.

213
00:17:27,500 --> 00:17:30,500
I just want the person I truly want

214
00:17:30,500 --> 00:17:39,500
to be happy and happy.

215
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:07,500
How long can I hold on?

216
00:18:09,500 --> 00:18:11,500
Just like before,

217
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:15,500
you should leave yourself to me.

218
00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:24,500
You are the only one who can handle yourself.

219
00:18:24,500 --> 00:18:29,500
You are the only one who can handle yourself.

220
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:35,500
Why do you still have to struggle?

221
00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:43,500
You don't understand at all.

222
00:18:52,500 --> 00:18:54,500
What?

223
00:19:00,500 --> 00:19:02,500
I can't understand at all.

You will pay a price for everything

Xiao Vincent, why are you here?

305
00:23:17,560 --> 00:23:37,320

How do you truly love no one?

309
00:23:46,600 --> 00:23:48,320
Is this worried about myself anymore?

310
00:23:50,800 --> 00:23:52,020
Why?

311
00:23:54,160 --> 00:23:54,900
I do not know

312
00:23:54,900 --> 00:23:57,460
How if I marry someone for money?

313
00:23:58,060 --> 00:23:59,860
Firstly, you will be divorced

314
00:24:00,200 --> 00:24:01,500
Secondly,에게 hubît

315
00:24:01,500 --> 00:24:02,820

Get down!

317
00:24:14,820 --> 00:24:15,820
Lord Zhu.

318
00:24:17,140 --> 00:24:18,740
I hurt everyone.

319
00:24:19,540 --> 00:24:21,500
Thank you for giving me a chance to follow you.

320
00:24:26,620 --> 00:24:27,660
Are you scared?

321
00:24:32,500 --> 00:24:33,500
Are you scared?

322
00:24:37,500 --> 00:24:39,500
As long as I can save Wenjie,

323
00:24:40,500 --> 00:24:41,500
I'm not afraid.

324
00:24:50,980 --> 00:24:52,340
Then follow me.

325
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:03,500
The Mountain God.

326
00:25:18,500 --> 00:25:19,500
Hold it.

327
00:25:29,500 --> 00:25:30,500
I'm afraid you'll lose it.

328
00:25:32,500 --> 00:25:34,500
I'll take you to the Mountain God.

329
00:25:46,500 --> 00:25:47,500
Who's there?

330
00:25:51,500 --> 00:25:52,500
Yinglei, are you crazy?

331
00:25:53,500 --> 00:25:54,500
Why are you asking me?

332
00:25:55,500 --> 00:25:56,500
She's not Yinglei.

333
00:25:57,500 --> 00:25:58,500
She's Ao Yin.

334
00:26:02,500 --> 00:26:03,500
Stop!

335
00:26:03,500 --> 00:26:04,500
Lord Zhu.

336
00:26:08,500 --> 00:26:09,500
Xiao Shu, slow down.

337
00:26:09,500 --> 00:26:10,500
Wait for me.

338
00:26:11,500 --> 00:26:12,500
Wait for me.

339
00:26:16,500 --> 00:26:17,500
Lord Zhu, be careful.

340
00:26:17,500 --> 00:26:18,500
She's Ao Yin.

341
00:26:19,500 --> 00:26:20,500
You're Ao Yin.

342
00:26:21,500 --> 00:26:22,500
I'll take the Cloud Sword.

343
00:26:22,500 --> 00:26:23,500
How can I be Ao Yin?

344
00:26:24,500 --> 00:26:25,500
I'm also a thief.

345
00:26:25,500 --> 00:26:26,500
I can't be Ao Yin.

346
00:26:26,500 --> 00:26:27,500
You can buy anything on the street.

347
00:26:28,500 --> 00:26:29,500
How can the Cloud Sword be fake?

348
00:26:32,500 --> 00:26:33,500
It's a little bit reasonable.

349
00:26:34,500 --> 00:26:35,500
What's the first thing that comes to the door

350
00:26:35,500 --> 00:26:37,500
on the Mount Kunlun Star Map?

351
00:26:40,500 --> 00:26:41,500
You're indeed an Ao Yin.

352
00:26:41,500 --> 00:26:42,500
Wait, wait, wait.

353
00:26:42,500 --> 00:26:43,500
Wait, wait, wait.

354
00:26:43,500 --> 00:26:44,500
This question is too hard.

355
00:26:44,500 --> 00:26:45,500
I've never been this way since I was a kid.

356
00:26:46,500 --> 00:26:47,500
It's reasonable.

357
00:26:51,500 --> 00:26:52,500
Your dream is

358
00:26:52,500 --> 00:26:53,500
to be a thief.

359
00:26:53,500 --> 00:26:54,500
Who is it?

360
00:26:54,500 --> 00:26:56,500
It's like the most beautiful thing in the world.

361
00:26:57,500 --> 00:26:58,500
Go, go, go, go.

362
00:26:58,500 --> 00:26:59,500
Go, go, go, go.

363
00:26:59,500 --> 00:27:00,500
It's the mirror.

364
00:27:00,500 --> 00:27:01,500
That's right.

365
00:27:01,500 --> 00:27:02,500
It's the thunder.

366
00:27:03,500 --> 00:27:04,500
That's right.

367
00:27:05,500 --> 00:27:06,500
No, the first sentence you said

368
00:27:06,500 --> 00:27:08,500
was also Lord Zhu's.

369
00:27:08,500 --> 00:27:10,500
Why didn't you take me as your wife?

370
00:27:10,500 --> 00:27:12,500
Do I look like I'm so secretive?

371
00:27:13,500 --> 00:27:14,500
I'm sure.

372
00:27:14,500 --> 00:27:15,500
He's definitely a thunder.

373
00:27:18,500 --> 00:27:20,500
Why don't you suspect me?

374
00:27:20,500 --> 00:27:21,500
You're just a little wine.

375
00:27:22,500 --> 00:27:23,500
You have a strong taste of herbs.

376
00:27:25,500 --> 00:27:27,500
Lord Zhu, you also smell it.

377
00:27:27,500 --> 00:27:29,500
I've liked herbs since I was a kid.

378
00:27:31,500 --> 00:27:34,500
Because it makes me feel calm and calm.

379
00:27:36,500 --> 00:27:37,500
I also like the smell of herbs.

380
00:27:38,500 --> 00:27:40,500
And the smell of taro.

381
00:27:41,500 --> 00:27:44,500
Onion, green pepper, green onion, carrot, white radish,

382
00:27:44,500 --> 00:27:46,500
and the smell of coriander.

383
00:27:46,500 --> 00:27:47,500
It's not bad.

384
00:27:47,500 --> 00:27:48,500
What's the problem?

385
00:27:48,500 --> 00:27:49,500
Actually, coriander is good.

386
00:27:49,500 --> 00:27:50,500
It's not bad.

387
00:27:50,500 --> 00:27:51,500
Don't use the word coriander.

388
00:27:51,500 --> 00:27:52,500
It's not bad.

389
00:27:54,500 --> 00:27:55,500
Xiao Jiao.

390
00:27:57,500 --> 00:27:58,500
Xiao Jiao.

391
00:28:27,500 --> 00:28:28,500
You said

392
00:28:29,500 --> 00:28:30,500
someone was behind the suspect

393
00:28:30,500 --> 00:28:32,500
and was the murderer.

394
00:28:35,500 --> 00:28:36,500
Yes.

395
00:28:38,500 --> 00:28:39,500
At this time,

396
00:28:39,500 --> 00:28:41,500
Lord Zhu is going to return to the king.

397
00:28:42,500 --> 00:28:44,500
It should be to stop me from repairing the White-Colored Cove.

398
00:28:46,500 --> 00:28:48,500
The case is in the wrong place.

399
00:28:48,500 --> 00:28:49,500
I'm sorry.

400
00:28:49,500 --> 00:28:50,500
I'm sorry.

401
00:28:51,500 --> 00:28:52,500
I'm sorry.

402
00:28:53,500 --> 00:28:54,500
I'm sorry.

403
00:28:55,500 --> 00:28:57,500
The case is in the wrong place.

404
00:28:57,500 --> 00:28:58,500
The case is in the wrong place.

405
00:28:58,500 --> 00:28:59,500
I'm sorry.

406
00:28:59,500 --> 00:29:00,500
I'm sorry.

407
00:29:01,500 --> 00:29:02,500
Then, the person behind this

408
00:29:03,500 --> 00:29:04,500
Do you have any complaints?

409
00:29:07,500 --> 00:29:08,500
Wenzong Yu.

410
00:29:12,500 --> 00:29:16,500
But the Prime Minister obviously got killed by the monster.

411
00:29:16,500 --> 00:29:18,500
Wenzong Yu is a mortal.

412
00:29:18,500 --> 00:29:20,500
How can the monster be so serious about him?

413
00:29:20,500 --> 00:29:21,500
I'm sorry.

414
00:29:23,500 --> 00:29:24,500
It's not right.

415
00:29:43,500 --> 00:29:45,500
I saw a girl

416
00:29:46,500 --> 00:29:47,500
who looked like you

417
00:29:47,500 --> 00:29:49,500
in the illusion of the wheel.

418
00:29:51,500 --> 00:29:53,500
She looked like the subordinate of the wheel.

419
00:29:54,500 --> 00:29:55,500
Di Zun?

420
00:29:59,500 --> 00:30:01,500
But the wheel is dead.

421
00:30:02,500 --> 00:30:03,500
In front of you,

422
00:30:04,500 --> 00:30:06,500
you were burned to ashes.

423
00:30:08,500 --> 00:30:10,500
But at that time,

424
00:30:11,500 --> 00:30:13,500
we didn't find the wheel.

425
00:30:15,500 --> 00:30:17,500
Did the wheel really die?

426
00:30:21,500 --> 00:30:23,500
Why didn't you see the wheel?

427
00:30:24,500 --> 00:30:25,500
Not only that,

428
00:30:26,500 --> 00:30:28,500
the King of Fire

429
00:30:29,500 --> 00:30:30,500
can save everything.

430
00:30:31,500 --> 00:30:32,500
I'm afraid that the wheel

431
00:30:33,500 --> 00:30:34,500
can't be left.

432
00:30:41,500 --> 00:30:43,500
You mean

433
00:30:44,500 --> 00:30:45,500
Li Wen didn't die?

434
00:30:51,500 --> 00:30:52,500
Don't worry.

435
00:30:52,500 --> 00:30:53,500
Someone is coming.

436
00:30:53,500 --> 00:30:54,500
Who?

437
00:30:54,500 --> 00:30:55,500
Ask them.

438
00:31:02,500 --> 00:31:03,500
Be careful.

439
00:31:03,500 --> 00:31:04,500
It's okay.

440
00:31:04,500 --> 00:31:05,500
Be careful.

441
00:31:20,500 --> 00:31:22,500
This sound.

442
00:31:25,500 --> 00:31:27,500
It can be used as a drawing.

443
00:31:28,500 --> 00:31:29,500
It's really hard to deal with.

444
00:31:29,500 --> 00:31:31,500
But if he knows

445
00:31:31,500 --> 00:31:33,500
our secrets and habits,

446
00:31:33,500 --> 00:31:35,500
it's even harder to change.

447
00:31:35,500 --> 00:31:36,500
Yes.

448
00:31:36,500 --> 00:31:38,500
His body speed is fast

449
00:31:38,500 --> 00:31:39,500
and hard to catch.

450
00:31:41,500 --> 00:31:42,500
The space in the forest

451
00:31:42,500 --> 00:31:43,500
is very difficult to catch.

452
00:31:43,500 --> 00:31:45,500
It's very difficult to catch.

453
00:31:45,500 --> 00:31:46,500
It's very difficult to catch.

454
00:31:46,500 --> 00:31:47,500
It's very difficult to catch.

455
00:31:48,500 --> 00:31:49,500
The space in the forest

456
00:31:49,500 --> 00:31:51,500
is very difficult to catch.

457
00:31:51,500 --> 00:31:53,500
It's very difficult to catch.

458
00:31:55,500 --> 00:31:57,500
What's the general meaning

459
00:31:57,500 --> 00:31:58,500
of his life?

460
00:32:02,500 --> 00:32:03,500
At that time,

461
00:32:03,500 --> 00:32:05,500
I was out of the small mountain.

462
00:32:05,500 --> 00:32:07,500
Li Wan, Huang Lan.

463
00:32:09,500 --> 00:32:11,500
When I was running in the owing,

464
00:32:11,500 --> 00:32:12,500
I saw my special perfume

465
00:32:12,500 --> 00:32:14,500
on his body.

466
00:32:14,500 --> 00:32:16,500
I was so surprised.

467
00:32:16,500 --> 00:32:17,500
I was so surprised.

468
00:32:19,500 --> 00:32:20,500
But Mr. Zhu said

469
00:32:20,500 --> 00:32:22,500
his speed was very fast.

470
00:32:22,500 --> 00:32:23,500
Even if we caught him,

471
00:32:23,500 --> 00:32:25,500
it's hard to catch him.

472
00:32:25,500 --> 00:32:27,500
Then let's keep looking.

473
00:32:27,500 --> 00:32:28,500
Don't you still have a general meaning?

474
00:32:28,500 --> 00:32:29,500
Yes.

475
00:32:30,500 --> 00:32:31,500
Change the forest umbrella.

476
00:32:32,500 --> 00:32:33,500
Yes.

477
00:32:33,500 --> 00:32:35,500
I have something to change the forest umbrella.

478
00:32:35,500 --> 00:32:37,500
But for the owing,

479
00:32:37,500 --> 00:32:39,500
it seems not enough.

480
00:32:39,500 --> 00:32:40,500
What do you need?

481
00:32:44,500 --> 00:32:45,500
Well,

482
00:32:46,500 --> 00:32:47,500
I know.

483
00:32:47,500 --> 00:32:48,500
But because of the grass.

484
00:32:50,500 --> 00:32:51,500
Grass?

485
00:32:51,500 --> 00:32:52,500
Grass.

486
00:32:52,500 --> 00:32:53,500
It can make people numb.

487
00:32:53,500 --> 00:32:55,500
It can also make the demon numb.

488
00:32:55,500 --> 00:32:57,500
It can greatly reduce the speed of the owing.

489
00:33:00,500 --> 00:33:01,500
Mr. Zhu,

490
00:33:01,500 --> 00:33:02,500
you are amazing.

491
00:33:04,500 --> 00:33:05,500
You are really amazing.

492
00:33:05,500 --> 00:33:07,500
You are the best in the world.

493
00:33:12,500 --> 00:33:13,500
You are so stubborn.

494
00:33:14,500 --> 00:33:15,500
You are so good.

495
00:33:25,500 --> 00:33:27,500
I have never been so hurt by Zhao Yanzhou.

496
00:33:27,500 --> 00:33:29,500
I have always been.

497
00:33:31,500 --> 00:33:33,500
But when his position is empty,

498
00:33:35,500 --> 00:33:38,500
I hope Mr. Pei can take care of his position.

499
00:33:40,500 --> 00:33:41,500
Do you want to take care of him

500
00:33:41,500 --> 00:33:43,500
and continue to be your shield?

501
00:33:44,500 --> 00:33:45,500
Why do you think that

502
00:33:45,500 --> 00:33:47,500
everyone in the world

503
00:33:47,500 --> 00:33:49,500
is willing to die for you?

504
00:33:52,500 --> 00:33:54,500
The king is confused and anxious.

505
00:33:55,500 --> 00:33:57,500
The demon is brave and stubborn.

506
00:33:57,500 --> 00:33:59,500
He is brave and brave.

507
00:34:00,500 --> 00:34:03,500
Mr. Pei's brother is the demon who is hurt.

508
00:34:03,500 --> 00:34:06,500
I am so touched by his experience.

509
00:34:06,500 --> 00:34:07,500
In my opinion,

510
00:34:07,500 --> 00:34:09,500
we should be the same.

511
00:34:09,500 --> 00:34:11,500
We are the same kind of people.

512
00:34:12,500 --> 00:34:14,500
You said you were so close to me.

513
00:34:14,500 --> 00:34:16,500
You are so cruel to the demon.

514
00:34:18,500 --> 00:34:19,500
Is it possible

515
00:34:20,500 --> 00:34:22,500
that the person who is important to you

516
00:34:22,500 --> 00:34:24,500
is also hurt by the demon?

517
00:34:27,500 --> 00:34:29,500
You are so stubborn.

518
00:34:30,500 --> 00:34:32,500
I heard about your ship before.

519
00:34:33,500 --> 00:34:35,500
You joined the Chongwu camp ten years ago.

520
00:34:36,500 --> 00:34:38,500
You are just a normal group.

521
00:34:39,500 --> 00:34:41,500
But you have been

522
00:34:41,500 --> 00:34:44,500
a soldier for a long time.

523
00:34:45,500 --> 00:34:47,500
Everyone is very despicable.

524
00:34:49,500 --> 00:34:51,500
This is my ability.

525
00:34:51,500 --> 00:34:53,500
I have too much credit.

526
00:34:53,500 --> 00:34:55,500
I just want to be a low-key person.

527
00:34:56,500 --> 00:34:58,500
I don't want to be a person.

528
00:34:58,500 --> 00:35:01,500
That's because you have too many dirty things to do.

529
00:35:01,500 --> 00:35:03,500
You can't see the light.

530
00:35:04,500 --> 00:35:05,500
It's not just your fault.

531
00:35:05,500 --> 00:35:06,500
It's not...

532
00:35:06,500 --> 00:35:07,500
It's not your fault.

533
00:35:07,500 --> 00:35:10,500
Zhenmei is an orphan.

534
00:35:10,500 --> 00:35:12,500
I raised her.

535
00:35:12,500 --> 00:35:15,500
Of course, it's a mistake to be strict with me.

536
00:35:17,500 --> 00:35:19,500
But you are so innocent.

537
00:35:20,500 --> 00:35:22,500
Zhenmei is so hard to save you

538
00:35:22,500 --> 00:35:24,500
and is seriously injured.

539
00:35:25,500 --> 00:35:26,500
But at this moment,

540
00:35:26,500 --> 00:35:28,500
you only use her official position

541
00:35:28,500 --> 00:35:30,500
to talk to me.

542
00:35:31,500 --> 00:35:33,500
It seems that Mr. Pei

543
00:35:34,500 --> 00:35:36,500
doesn't agree with you.

544
00:35:53,500 --> 00:35:54,500
If you are stubborn,

545
00:35:54,500 --> 00:35:58,500
you can be a commander of the Chongwu camp.

546
00:35:59,500 --> 00:36:00,500
If you are not stubborn,

547
00:36:01,500 --> 00:36:03,500
you can only die

548
00:36:03,500 --> 00:36:05,500
and become the food for the demon.

549
00:36:05,500 --> 00:36:07,500
Go.

550
00:36:07,500 --> 00:36:09,500
Are you okay?

551
00:36:11,500 --> 00:36:13,500
I'm fine.

552
00:36:15,500 --> 00:36:17,500
You...

553
00:36:23,500 --> 00:36:25,500
Are you okay?

554
00:36:27,500 --> 00:36:29,500
I'm fine.

555
00:36:31,500 --> 00:36:33,500
I'm fine.

556
00:36:33,500 --> 00:36:35,500
I'm fine.

557
00:36:36,500 --> 00:36:38,500
Is it that soldier?

558
00:36:40,500 --> 00:36:42,500
His old hair is damaged.

559
00:36:42,500 --> 00:36:43,500
I'm worried...

560
00:36:43,500 --> 00:36:45,500
You don't trust me that much?

561
00:36:48,500 --> 00:36:50,500
It's not that I don't trust you.

562
00:36:51,500 --> 00:36:53,500
It's just that I can't keep my word.

563
00:36:54,500 --> 00:36:56,500
I'm going to deliver the food soon.

564
00:36:56,500 --> 00:36:58,500
I'm waiting for you to eat.

565
00:36:58,500 --> 00:37:00,500
Or not?

566
00:37:00,500 --> 00:37:02,500
What?

567
00:37:02,500 --> 00:37:04,500
Do you want me to accompany you

568
00:37:04,500 --> 00:37:06,500
with a bowl of rice soup?

569
00:37:08,500 --> 00:37:10,500
You can enjoy the food

570
00:37:10,500 --> 00:37:12,500
as you like.

571
00:37:13,500 --> 00:37:15,500
The food is delicious

572
00:37:16,500 --> 00:37:18,500
and the food is delicious.

573
00:37:19,500 --> 00:37:21,500
The food is delicious.

574
00:37:21,500 --> 00:37:23,500
The food is delicious.

575
00:37:23,500 --> 00:37:25,500
The food is delicious.

576
00:37:25,500 --> 00:37:27,500
The food is delicious.

577
00:37:27,500 --> 00:37:29,500
The food is delicious.

578
00:37:31,500 --> 00:37:33,500
The food is delicious.

579
00:37:36,500 --> 00:37:38,500
What a coincidence.

580
00:37:38,500 --> 00:37:40,500
Did you learn from Zhang Yanzhou?

581
00:37:40,500 --> 00:37:42,500
Thank you, sister.

582
00:38:01,500 --> 00:38:04,500
You even changed your clothes.

583
00:38:04,500 --> 00:38:06,500
What are you looking for?

584
00:38:12,500 --> 00:38:14,500
The spice smell is gone.

585
00:38:14,500 --> 00:38:16,500
It's gone.

586
00:38:16,500 --> 00:38:18,500
It must be inside.

587
00:38:23,500 --> 00:38:25,500
You're so naughty.

588
00:38:31,500 --> 00:38:33,500
Sister.

589
00:38:35,500 --> 00:38:37,500
Sister.

590
00:38:37,500 --> 00:38:39,500
Yinglei.

591
00:38:39,500 --> 00:38:41,500
Are you sure?

592
00:38:41,500 --> 00:38:43,500
Do you know where this is?

593
00:38:43,500 --> 00:38:45,500
It looks like a good place.

594
00:38:47,500 --> 00:38:49,500
It's where your children shouldn't come.

595
00:38:53,500 --> 00:38:55,500
I'm 237 years old.

596
00:38:55,500 --> 00:38:57,500
I'm the youngest, of course.

597
00:38:57,500 --> 00:38:59,500
How old are you?

598
00:38:59,500 --> 00:39:01,500
24 years old.

599
00:39:01,500 --> 00:39:03,500
I'm 23.

600
00:39:05,500 --> 00:39:07,500
The powder is heavy.

601
00:39:07,500 --> 00:39:09,500
I should cover my own skin.

602
00:39:09,500 --> 00:39:11,500
I'm sure I'll choose to stay here.

603
00:39:11,500 --> 00:39:13,500
Why don't you choose

604
00:39:13,500 --> 00:39:15,500
to stay in the Dala Jitui?

605
00:39:15,500 --> 00:39:17,500
You can cover your skin better.

606
00:39:18,500 --> 00:39:19,500
That's right.

607
00:39:19,500 --> 00:39:21,500
So you're a girl.

608
00:39:22,500 --> 00:39:24,500
I said it.

609
00:39:24,500 --> 00:39:27,500
If you want to continue talking, stay here.

610
00:39:27,500 --> 00:39:30,500
If you want to investigate, just shut up and come with me.

611
00:39:30,500 --> 00:39:32,500
Xiaozhou.

612
00:39:32,500 --> 00:39:34,500
I want to remind you.

613
00:39:34,500 --> 00:39:49,360
The sound is not just a movement to the

614
00:39:49,360 --> 00:39:51,360
sound.

615
00:39:51,360 --> 00:39:54,360
It's not a place where children should come.

616
00:39:54,360 --> 00:39:56,360
If the sound is really inside,

617
00:39:56,360 --> 00:39:58,360
it might be dangerous inside.

618
00:39:58,360 --> 00:40:00,360
Wait here.

619
00:40:00,360 --> 00:40:02,360
Okay.

620
00:40:07,360 --> 00:40:09,360
Let's go.

621
00:40:19,360 --> 00:40:21,360
Come on.

622
00:40:31,360 --> 00:40:33,360
You really come here to have fun?

623
00:40:33,360 --> 00:40:35,360
It's just a dream of you.

624
00:40:35,360 --> 00:40:37,360
You're really the Lord Zhuo Yichen.

625
00:40:37,360 --> 00:40:39,360
Why did you come here?

626
00:40:39,360 --> 00:40:41,360
I'm drunk today.

627
00:40:41,360 --> 00:40:43,360
Come here.

628
00:40:45,360 --> 00:40:47,360
Zhuo Yichen.

629
00:40:47,360 --> 00:40:49,360
Girls, come here.

630
00:40:49,360 --> 00:40:51,360
Zhuo Yichen, come to the heaven.

631
00:40:51,360 --> 00:40:53,360
Don't be so loud.

632
00:40:53,360 --> 00:40:54,360
I'm not here to hang out.

633
00:40:54,360 --> 00:40:56,360
I'm here to find someone.

634
00:40:56,360 --> 00:40:57,360
I know.

635
00:40:57,360 --> 00:40:58,360
I know.

636
00:40:58,360 --> 00:40:59,360
I'm just a little girl.

637
00:40:59,360 --> 00:41:00,360
Girls,

638
00:41:00,360 --> 00:41:02,360
let the flower garden be in front of you.

639
00:41:02,360 --> 00:41:04,360
Come here.

640
00:41:04,360 --> 00:41:06,360
Come here.

641
00:41:06,360 --> 00:41:08,360
Come here.

642
00:41:08,360 --> 00:41:10,360
The sky is clear.

643
00:41:10,360 --> 00:41:13,360
The Lord Zhuo Yichen is really a little girl.

644
00:41:13,360 --> 00:41:15,360
He's a little girl.

645
00:41:15,360 --> 00:41:17,360
The Lord Zhuo Yichen.

646
00:41:17,360 --> 00:41:19,360
Come here.

647
00:41:19,360 --> 00:41:21,360
Come here.

648
00:41:21,360 --> 00:41:23,360
Come here.

649
00:41:24,360 --> 00:41:25,360
Come here.

650
00:41:25,360 --> 00:41:26,360
Good.

651
00:41:26,360 --> 00:41:27,360
You're here.

652
00:41:27,360 --> 00:41:28,360
It's okay.

653
00:41:28,360 --> 00:41:30,360
Why are you here?

654
00:41:30,360 --> 00:41:31,360
If it wasn't for me,

655
00:41:31,360 --> 00:41:33,360
I would have said you were here.

656
00:41:33,360 --> 00:41:34,360
Dad.

657
00:41:34,360 --> 00:41:35,360
It's not me.

658
00:41:35,360 --> 00:41:37,360
You just...

659
00:41:37,360 --> 00:41:39,360
What's wrong?

660
00:41:40,360 --> 00:41:42,360
It smells like a perfume.

661
00:41:44,360 --> 00:41:46,360
Is that girl dancing?

662
00:41:53,360 --> 00:41:55,360
I'm not sure.

663
00:41:55,360 --> 00:41:57,360
I want to eat it.

664
00:41:59,360 --> 00:42:00,360
Here.

665
00:42:07,360 --> 00:42:09,360
It's her.

666
00:42:14,360 --> 00:42:15,360
Divide into two groups.

667
00:42:15,360 --> 00:42:17,360
What's the meaning of this?

668
00:42:17,360 --> 00:42:18,360
Okay.

669
00:42:18,360 --> 00:42:19,360
Let's go.

670
00:42:19,360 --> 00:42:20,360
Let's go.

671
00:42:38,360 --> 00:42:39,360
Miss.

672
00:42:44,360 --> 00:42:46,360
Miss, please stay.

673
00:42:48,360 --> 00:42:49,360
Miss.

674
00:42:55,360 --> 00:42:56,360
Miss.

675
00:42:56,360 --> 00:42:58,360
I'm in the room.

676
00:43:08,360 --> 00:43:09,360
It's done.

677
00:43:09,360 --> 00:43:10,360
Go away.

678
00:43:10,360 --> 00:43:11,360
Let's go.

679
00:43:11,360 --> 00:43:12,360
What are you doing?

680
00:43:13,360 --> 00:43:15,360
I'm running away.

681
00:43:15,360 --> 00:43:16,360
Stop.

682
00:43:16,360 --> 00:43:17,360
Stop.

683
00:43:17,360 --> 00:43:18,360
Stop.

684
00:43:18,360 --> 00:43:19,360
Stop.

685
00:43:19,360 --> 00:43:20,360
Come back.

686
00:43:21,360 --> 00:43:22,360
Where is it?

687
00:43:22,360 --> 00:43:23,360
No.

688
00:43:23,360 --> 00:43:24,360
It's you.

689
00:43:24,360 --> 00:43:25,360
You dare to ask me?

690
00:43:25,360 --> 00:43:27,360
If it wasn't because you're Chuan,

691
00:43:27,360 --> 00:43:29,360
I wouldn't have been in the palace.

692
00:43:29,360 --> 00:43:31,360
I'm not afraid of you.

693
00:43:31,360 --> 00:43:33,360
I'm just a little girl.

694
00:43:33,360 --> 00:43:35,360
I'm not afraid of you.

695
00:43:35,360 --> 00:43:38,360
If it wasn't for you being the playboy of the pet,

696
00:43:38,360 --> 00:43:40,360
we would have been like this.

697
00:43:40,360 --> 00:43:42,360
Sorry, sorry. I'm sorry.

698
00:43:42,360 --> 00:43:44,360
You're a liar.

699
00:43:44,360 --> 00:43:46,360
You liar!

700
00:43:46,360 --> 00:43:48,360
You!

701
00:43:48,360 --> 00:43:50,360
You! You're not with yourself!

702
00:43:50,360 --> 00:43:52,360
You're a monkey!

703
00:43:52,360 --> 00:43:54,360
Stop!

704
00:43:56,360 --> 00:44:00,360
You little demon! How dare you go to the Demon's Way!

705
00:44:02,360 --> 00:44:04,360
I'll leave here and return to the Emperor.

706
00:44:04,360 --> 00:44:06,360
I'll take her away too!

707
00:44:17,360 --> 00:44:18,360
Wenxiao?

708
00:44:18,360 --> 00:44:20,360
Xiaozhu, it's me.

709
00:44:30,360 --> 00:44:31,360
No!

710
00:44:32,360 --> 00:44:34,360
Xiaozhu, look at me.

711
00:44:34,360 --> 00:44:36,360
Look at me!

712
00:44:36,360 --> 00:44:38,360
I'm not!

713
00:44:44,360 --> 00:44:46,360
Xiaozhu.

714
00:44:48,360 --> 00:44:51,360
Why did you take this sword to stab me?

715
00:44:54,360 --> 00:44:56,360
Xiaozhu.

716
00:44:56,360 --> 00:44:58,360
I'm Wenxiao.

717
00:44:59,360 --> 00:45:01,360
Wenxiao.

718
00:45:01,360 --> 00:45:03,360
Don't you like my mother?

719
00:45:09,360 --> 00:45:11,360
Xiaozhu.

720
00:45:13,360 --> 00:45:15,360
Xiaozhu.

721
00:45:20,360 --> 00:45:22,360
Xiaozhu.

722
00:45:28,360 --> 00:45:30,360
Xiaozhu.

723
00:45:58,360 --> 00:46:00,360
Xiaozhu.

724
00:46:28,360 --> 00:46:30,360
Xiaozhu.

725
00:46:58,360 --> 00:47:00,360
I'm Wenxiao.

726
00:47:00,360 --> 00:47:02,360
I'm Wenxiao.

727
00:47:02,360 --> 00:47:04,360
I'm Wenxiao.

728
00:47:04,360 --> 00:47:06,360
I'm Wenxiao.

729
00:47:06,360 --> 00:47:08,360
I'm Wenxiao.

730
00:47:08,360 --> 00:47:10,360
I'm Wenxiao.

731
00:47:10,360 --> 00:47:12,360
I'm Wenxiao.

732
00:47:12,360 --> 00:47:14,360
I'm Wenxiao.

733
00:47:14,360 --> 00:47:16,360
I'm Wenxiao.

734
00:47:16,360 --> 00:47:18,360
I'm Wenxiao.

735
00:47:18,360 --> 00:47:20,360
I'm Wenxiao.

736
00:47:20,360 --> 00:47:22,360
I'm Wenxiao.

737
00:47:22,360 --> 00:47:24,360
I'm Wenxiao.

738
00:47:24,360 --> 00:47:26,360
I'm Wenxiao.
