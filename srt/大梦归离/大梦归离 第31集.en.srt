00:01:54,350 --> 00:01:55,320
How is it?

4
00:02:03,910 --> 00:02:05,140
I knew

5
00:02:07,030 --> 00:02:08,630
I probably can't be detoxified.

6
00:02:11,110 --> 00:02:13,190
I just wanted to give it a try.

7
00:02:15,030 --> 00:02:16,390
It's my fault.

8
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:21,310
You gave me the dragon scale to save me.

9
00:02:24,990 --> 00:02:25,950
Silly.

10
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:28,430
I'm glad to be able to

11
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:30,079
save you.

12
00:02:31,390 --> 00:02:32,450
If I die,

13
00:02:32,510 --> 00:02:34,940
there will be another Baize Goddess.

14

But Jiu…

15
00:02:38,550 --> 00:02:40,460
There's only one Jiu in the world.

16
00:02:43,260 --> 00:02:44,070
But

17
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:47,370
in this world,

18
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:51,000
there's also only one Wen Xiao.

19
00:03:18,950 --> 00:03:19,790
I'm sorry.

20
00:03:46,420 --> 00:03:47,540
Goddess,

21
00:03:47,650 --> 00:03:48,480
Mr. Zhao,

22

24
00:03:55,890 --> 00:03:57,790
Why is there a plague suddenly?

25
00:03:59,130 --> 00:04:00,710
The plague is fierce.

26
00:04:01,390 --> 00:04:02,890
The physicians in Tiandu

27
00:04:02,970 --> 00:04:04,310
are all helpless.

28
00:04:06,260 --> 00:04:08,070
Could it be caused by a demon?

29
00:04:08,970 --> 00:04:10,010
King Xiang

30
00:04:10,550 --> 00:04:12,150
will definitely put pressure on my father.

31
00:04:12,850 --> 00:04:14,420
That's what I wanted to tell you too.

32
00:04:15,110 --> 00:04:16,029
Mr. Fan

33
00:04:17,339 --> 00:04:18,450

34
00:04:23,510 --> 00:04:24,120
Father!

35
00:04:24,150 --> 00:04:24,790
It's me.

36
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:25,910
Jiu.

37
00:04:25,910 --> 00:04:26,940
Don't come in.

38
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:28,670
I've been infected.

39
00:04:28,830 --> 00:04:30,070
It's contagious.

40
00:04:30,430 --> 00:04:32,280
Everyone in Tiandu

41
00:04:32,350 --> 00:04:33,780
has probably been infected.

42
00:04:33,909 --> 00:04:35,790
The origin of this plague

43
00:04:35,990 --> 00:04:38,230
was a child of an ordinary family.

44
00:04:38,250 --> 00:04:40,210
Unexpectedly, it spread so fast.

45
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:52,390
I suspect this sachet

46
00:04:52,950 --> 00:04:55,390
might be the source of the plague.

47
00:04:58,550 --> 00:04:59,550
It's demon blood.

48
00:05:01,070 --> 00:05:01,870
Demon blood?

49
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:04,510
Which demon's blood?

50
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:08,730
A demon that we are familiar with.

51
00:05:11,990 --> 00:05:12,720
Fei.

52
00:05:15,350 --> 00:05:16,310
Fei?

53
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:18,630
Isn't he dead?

54
00:05:19,630 --> 00:05:20,150
It's...

55
00:05:20,170 --> 00:05:21,510
It's this sachet.

Step back a little.

59
00:05:27,060 --> 00:05:27,670
Step back.

60
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:32,159
Good.

61
00:05:32,490 --> 00:05:33,750
The city

62
00:05:33,830 --> 00:05:35,540
is full of infected civilians.

63
00:05:36,190 --> 00:05:37,490
We are in the city.

64
00:05:37,830 --> 00:05:38,790
We can't avoid it.

65
00:05:39,909 --> 00:05:40,860
It'll happen sooner or later.

67
00:05:43,350 --> 00:05:44,640
do you have any ideas?

68
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:48,620
I need to study this.

69
00:06:33,550 --> 00:06:34,390
Are you okay?

70
00:06:35,630 --> 00:06:37,140
I can hold on.

71
00:06:38,850 --> 00:06:39,950
But

72
00:06:40,470 --> 00:06:41,600
I haven't detected

73
00:06:41,630 --> 00:06:44,190
the energy of any demons in Tiandu.

74
00:06:45,870 --> 00:06:47,580
Not even Fei's demonic energy.

75
00:06:49,750 --> 00:06:51,290
That's even stranger.

76
00:07:29,030 --> 00:07:29,830
Brother Zhuo?

77
00:07:39,830 --> 00:07:40,620
They said

78
00:07:40,940 --> 00:07:42,270
you stayed here all day

79
00:07:43,270 --> 00:07:44,190
and haven't even eaten.

80
00:07:45,590 --> 00:07:46,430
I'm not hungry.

81
00:07:47,510 --> 00:07:48,659
Time is running out.

82
00:07:50,830 --> 00:07:51,940
For a long time

83
00:07:52,710 --> 00:07:54,470
after my father and brother died,

84
00:07:55,630 --> 00:07:56,430
I was the same.

85
00:07:57,790 --> 00:07:58,530
Anxious.

86
00:07:59,730 --> 00:08:00,710
Worried.

87
00:08:01,820 --> 00:08:03,340
It always felt like there wasn't enough time.

88
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:06,590
Mr. Zhuo.

89
00:08:07,860 --> 00:08:09,070
Actually,

90
00:08:10,380 --> 00:08:12,000
I'm a little scared.

91
00:08:20,020 --> 00:08:21,260
Hold this.

92
00:08:23,430 --> 00:08:24,350
Tell me

93
00:08:24,910 --> 00:08:25,830
why you're scared.

94
00:08:26,950 --> 00:08:28,190
Before,

95
00:08:28,550 --> 00:08:29,700
I always thought

96
00:08:29,910 --> 00:08:30,950
that my dad

97
00:08:31,430 --> 00:08:32,539
killed my mom.

98
00:08:33,740 --> 00:08:35,350
That's why I ran away from home.

99
00:08:37,289 --> 00:08:39,370
I don't remember much about my father.

100
00:08:40,909 --> 00:08:42,679
Every time I thought of him,

101
00:08:43,820 --> 00:08:45,560
I would drown in hatred.

102
00:08:49,420 --> 00:08:50,730
Familial love

103
00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:53,050
is deep within one's body.

104
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,560
Time and distance

105
00:08:57,220 --> 00:08:59,470
can never wipe away its existence.

106
00:09:01,630 --> 00:09:02,760
Do you remember

107
00:09:02,790 --> 00:09:04,010
how I told you

108
00:09:04,030 --> 00:09:05,760
I like the smell of herbs?

109
00:09:06,580 --> 00:09:08,040
Of course I remember.

110
00:09:08,510 --> 00:09:10,460
I was very happy then,

111
00:09:10,850 --> 00:09:13,030
because I've been dealing with herbs since I was a kid.

112
00:09:13,590 --> 00:09:14,790
Actually, it's because

113
00:09:14,990 --> 00:09:16,790
my mother died from sickness

114
00:09:17,630 --> 00:09:18,870
when I was very little.

115
00:09:20,870 --> 00:09:22,070
My memories of her

116
00:09:22,380 --> 00:09:23,430
have blurred too.

117
00:09:25,070 --> 00:09:27,230
But I still remember the smell of herbs on her.

118
00:09:29,270 --> 00:09:31,720
Whenever I smell herbs after that,

119
00:09:33,030 --> 00:09:34,350
it feels like

120
00:09:34,990 --> 00:09:36,450
my mother is still holding me.

121
00:09:43,710 --> 00:09:44,670
I see.

122
00:09:46,010 --> 00:09:47,030
It's like how

123
00:09:47,050 --> 00:09:48,730
every time I drink almond buttermilk,

124
00:09:49,460 --> 00:09:50,820
I think of my mother.

125
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:53,920
Every time I eat delicious food,

126
00:09:55,110 --> 00:09:56,460
I think of Ying Lei.

127
00:09:57,870 --> 00:09:59,690
Every time I hear a bell,

128
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:03,300
I think of you, Mr. Zhuo.

129
00:10:10,950 --> 00:10:11,830
But

130
00:10:12,590 --> 00:10:14,510
I haven't sat down with Daddy

131
00:10:14,510 --> 00:10:15,800
and had a proper meal yet

132
00:10:16,150 --> 00:10:17,310
to clear up

133
00:10:17,470 --> 00:10:18,350
the misunderstanding.

134
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:23,350
Jiu,

135
00:10:23,910 --> 00:10:25,120
you have to believe

136
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:27,170
that you can cure it.

137
00:10:28,990 --> 00:10:30,220
There's still time.

138
00:10:39,700 --> 00:10:41,140
But I have no more.

139
00:10:45,550 --> 00:10:46,980
Mr. Zhuo.

140
00:10:48,770 --> 00:10:51,110
You must miss your brother and father

141
00:10:51,650 --> 00:10:52,710
frequently, right?

142
00:10:54,230 --> 00:10:54,790
Yes.

143
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,040
My brother

144
00:10:57,470 --> 00:10:59,110
was an amazing person.

145
00:11:00,260 --> 00:11:01,670
I admired them

146
00:11:02,270 --> 00:11:03,670
and I wanted to become like them.

147
00:11:06,310 --> 00:11:07,830
Mr. Zhuo.

148
00:11:09,630 --> 00:11:11,390
I want to be someone like you too.

149
00:11:12,350 --> 00:11:13,430
What kind of person am I?

150
00:11:16,350 --> 00:11:17,150
At least...

151
00:11:19,490 --> 00:11:21,630
At least someone who's not timid like me,

152
00:11:22,760 --> 00:11:24,410
only daring to

153
00:11:24,990 --> 00:11:26,830
move forward by holding onto the bell

154

hanging from someone's ribbon.

155
00:11:32,010 --> 00:11:33,240
Since young,

156
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:38,070
I always wanted to be an older brother

157
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:39,400
and protect others.

158
00:11:41,030 --> 00:11:42,540
I never did it.

159
00:11:45,070 --> 00:11:46,600
But your appearance

160
00:11:47,970 --> 00:11:49,240
helped me do it.

161
00:11:52,430 --> 00:11:53,300
You turned me

162
00:11:54,070 --> 00:11:55,160
into an older brother.

People like roses.

they'll praise it.

"So beautiful."

206
00:13:34,170 --> 00:13:35,600
Then they'll pick it

207
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:37,290
and place it in their hair,

208

they all feel envious.

Do you think this is love?

It is.

213

But there's another kind of love,

214
00:13:57,340 --> 00:13:58,340
which is

215

the second type

224

is more loving

225
00:14:29,230 --> 00:14:30,380
than the first kind?

226
00:14:32,490 --> 00:14:33,620
Because the second one

227
00:14:34,270 --> 00:14:35,470
is actually...

228
00:14:38,510 --> 00:14:39,530

I feel even more sorry toward you.

it's not my fault.

239

00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:23,660
Thank you, Ms. Wen.

352
00:22:24,430 --> 00:22:26,060
Remember to take the medicine.

353
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:27,740
Not only should you take it,

354
00:22:27,780 --> 00:22:29,510
but also inform your neighbors,

355
00:22:29,540 --> 00:22:30,570
friends, and families.

356
00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:32,150
Have them all come and get the medicine.

357
00:22:32,180 --> 00:22:33,230
Thank you.

358
00:22:37,840 --> 00:22:39,110
Where are Wen Xiao and the others?

359
00:22:39,900 --> 00:22:41,270
They sneaked out

360
00:22:41,270 --> 00:22:42,480
to Chongwu Camp.

361
00:22:44,440 --> 00:22:45,840
Fortunately, Sister Pei knows

362
00:22:45,870 --> 00:22:47,390
when Chongwu Camp changes shifts.

363
00:22:47,820 --> 00:22:49,240
Otherwise, we’d be in trouble.

364
00:22:49,800 --> 00:22:51,590
Why can’t the Baize Token find this place?

365
00:22:54,440 --> 00:22:56,840
There are talismans with Zhu Jian's blood in this secret room.

366
00:22:57,310 --> 00:22:58,670
It can block the demonic energy,

367
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:01,070
so I decided to take a gamble.

368
00:23:02,920 --> 00:23:04,570
Fei should be here.

369
00:23:05,620 --> 00:23:06,420
Yes.

370
00:23:07,540 --> 00:23:08,340
Here.

371
00:23:08,560 --> 00:23:09,370
Yes.

372
00:23:25,350 --> 00:23:26,810
Fei.

373
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:29,600
Isn’t Fei dead?

374
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:39,850
It really is Fei.

375
00:23:46,230 --> 00:23:47,350
Mr. Fan.

376
00:23:49,290 --> 00:23:50,300
Zhuo—

377
00:24:16,840 --> 00:24:17,270
Wen Xiao!

378
00:24:17,270 --> 00:24:17,830
Father!

379
00:24:18,630 --> 00:24:19,700
Father!

380
00:24:20,380 --> 00:24:21,180
Father!

381
00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:24,480
Let's go.

382
00:24:29,170 --> 00:24:29,980
Wait.

383
00:24:32,900 --> 00:24:34,220
There's an inner core

384
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:36,890
in Mr. Fan's body.

385
00:24:39,150 --> 00:24:40,880
How can a human have an inner core?

386
00:24:42,290 --> 00:24:44,030
Because I finally created

387
00:24:44,030 --> 00:24:45,650
a real demonized human.

388
00:25:12,730 --> 00:25:14,820
As expected, you're still alive.

389
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:19,850
Instead of being a human,

390
00:25:20,450 --> 00:25:22,780
why did you turn yourself into this demonic thing?

391
00:25:26,520 --> 00:25:28,160
This is a true rebirth.

392
00:25:48,630 --> 00:25:49,900
Phoenix.

393
00:25:54,070 --> 00:25:56,690
Looks like you are really smart.

394
00:25:59,870 --> 00:26:02,470
Princess Longyu gave you the Phoenix Pearl.

395
00:26:03,970 --> 00:26:05,440
You swallowed the Phoenix Pearl

396
00:26:06,280 --> 00:26:08,170
and turned yourself into a demonized human.

397
00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:10,160
I've always had the Phoenix Pearl.

398
00:26:11,230 --> 00:26:13,530
That's why you tried so hard

399
00:26:14,570 --> 00:26:16,900
to get Zhao Yuanzhou's inner core.

400
00:26:18,170 --> 00:26:19,110
The inner core

401
00:26:21,010 --> 00:26:22,980
had the Ever-Burning Wood that you wanted.

402
00:26:32,340 --> 00:26:33,630
Zhao Yuanzhou,

403
00:26:34,990 --> 00:26:36,730
in the end,

404
00:26:37,010 --> 00:26:39,680
the heavens made you repay what you owed me.

405
00:26:41,040 --> 00:26:43,870
Not only do I possess the demonic power of Phoenix now,

406
00:26:44,810 --> 00:26:47,280
but I also have the power of the Ever-Burning Wood.

407
00:26:58,440 --> 00:26:59,240
Sir!

408
00:27:02,630 --> 00:27:04,040
You're still alive.

409
00:27:06,150 --> 00:27:08,190
Our great mission is about to be completed.

410
00:27:10,310 --> 00:27:11,280
If you swallow it,

411
00:27:11,970 --> 00:27:13,910
you will be transformed completely.

412
00:27:19,210 --> 00:27:22,040
Now, I have the fire of the Ever-Burning Wood.

413
00:27:22,730 --> 00:27:24,920
I can create demon cores myself.

414
00:27:25,960 --> 00:27:27,210
Soon,

415
00:27:27,940 --> 00:27:31,300
I will have a perfect team of demonized humans.

416
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:34,230
Dream on.

417
00:27:34,950 --> 00:27:35,910
Today,

418
00:27:36,590 --> 00:27:38,040
I won't let you succeed!

419
00:27:45,960 --> 00:27:47,950
Unfortunately, I've succeeded.

420
00:27:48,780 --> 00:27:50,660
And it was all thanks to you.

421
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:53,190
Just now,

422
00:27:53,880 --> 00:27:56,600
you personally gave the demon core I created

423
00:27:57,110 --> 00:27:59,920
to all the people in the city.

424
00:28:00,170 --> 00:28:01,630
After tomorrow,

425
00:28:02,330 --> 00:28:03,700
everyone

426
00:28:04,520 --> 00:28:07,300
will gradually transform into demonized humans.

427
00:28:10,770 --> 00:28:14,020
[Paralysis Fruit]

428
00:28:15,510 --> 00:28:16,670
It's the paralysis fruit.

429
00:28:18,930 --> 00:28:21,020
You're still using Bai Jiu.

430
00:28:21,230 --> 00:28:22,200
Wen Zongyu,

431
00:28:23,090 --> 00:28:24,950
you hate demons so much,

432
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:26,770
but now you chose to be a demon.

433
00:28:26,810 --> 00:28:27,690
Isn't it ridiculous?

434
00:28:27,940 --> 00:28:29,050
You're a demon too.

435
00:28:30,090 --> 00:28:31,710
Don't you think you're ridiculous?

436
00:28:33,750 --> 00:28:35,660
The demons hurt my beloved wife first

437
00:28:36,190 --> 00:28:38,180
and then killed my wife, child, and brother.

438
00:28:38,990 --> 00:28:41,620
The tragedies in the mortal world are all caused by demons.

439
00:28:41,640 --> 00:28:42,760
So I want to kill demons.

440
00:28:42,780 --> 00:28:44,960
I want to kill all demons in the world!

441
00:28:47,070 --> 00:28:49,610
But as a human, I was born with little power.

442
00:28:50,470 --> 00:28:52,140
That's why I must fight for the rest of my life

443
00:28:52,310 --> 00:28:53,980
to create a power that is stronger

444
00:28:54,030 --> 00:28:55,830
and more invincible than demons.

445
00:28:56,590 --> 00:28:59,010
Your loved ones were also killed by demons.

446
00:28:59,620 --> 00:29:01,320
Why don't you understand me?

447
00:29:02,410 --> 00:29:03,210
Understand you?

448
00:29:04,270 --> 00:29:06,430
You disregarded the wishes of the city's people

449
00:29:07,060 --> 00:29:08,540
and turned them into mindless half-demon

450
00:29:08,570 --> 00:29:10,250
and half-human creatures.

451
00:29:10,620 --> 00:29:12,700
Yet you expect us to understand you?

452
00:29:14,500 --> 00:29:16,090
I'm doing this for their own good.

453
00:29:17,670 --> 00:29:19,790
Demonized humans have no pain

454
00:29:20,850 --> 00:29:22,500
and no worries.

455
00:29:23,240 --> 00:29:25,160
They only have powerful strength.

456
00:29:26,300 --> 00:29:28,530
I'll lead them to kill all the evil monsters,

457
00:29:28,560 --> 00:29:30,270
flatten the Wilderness,

458
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:33,670
and create a new world.

459
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:35,700
Wen Xiao,

460
00:29:35,850 --> 00:29:37,520
quickly take Mr. Fan away.

461
00:29:41,290 --> 00:29:42,550
It's the same trick again.

462
00:29:43,710 --> 00:29:45,340
You can only run away, right?

463
00:29:56,350 --> 00:29:57,030
Sir!

464
00:30:56,720 --> 00:30:57,910
The phoenix's power

465
00:30:58,020 --> 00:30:59,130
can control the karmic fire.

466
00:30:59,250 --> 00:31:01,280
The phoenix has an immortal body.

467
00:31:01,580 --> 00:31:02,930
It is reborn from fire.

468
00:31:03,560 --> 00:31:04,480
The greater the karmic fire,

469
00:31:04,510 --> 00:31:05,900
the stronger his spiritual energy is.

470
00:31:06,430 --> 00:31:07,550
We can't defeat him

471
00:31:08,160 --> 00:31:09,380
in the fire.

472
00:31:09,790 --> 00:31:10,880
That's why I brought him

473
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:12,800
to the icy Mount Kunlun.

474
00:31:12,990 --> 00:31:14,910
The demonic power of Bingyi Clan is best at manipulating ice and snow.

475
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:16,390
It happens to be the nemesis of karmic fire.

476
00:31:16,470 --> 00:31:17,260
Zhuo,

477
00:31:17,480 --> 00:31:18,680
do as I say.

478
00:31:21,560 --> 00:31:23,560
Since the sword has a shape,

479
00:31:25,550 --> 00:31:27,980
flowing water will be traceless.

480
00:31:28,910 --> 00:31:30,660
Flowing water will be traceless.

481
00:31:30,910 --> 00:31:32,500
The origin is formless.

482
00:31:32,670 --> 00:31:34,510
The origin is formless.

483
00:31:34,710 --> 00:31:36,270
It is born from a thought.

484
00:31:36,300 --> 00:31:37,730
It is born from a thought.

485
00:32:06,230 --> 00:32:07,160
This smoke...

486
00:32:11,310 --> 00:32:12,340
It seems to be poisonous.

487
00:32:12,520 --> 00:32:13,320
Seal.

488
00:32:14,350 --> 00:32:15,150
Zhuo!

489
00:32:56,980 --> 00:32:58,130
Zhao Yuanzhou.

490
00:33:03,130 --> 00:33:04,510
Zhao Yuanzhou.

491
00:33:04,670 --> 00:33:06,960
Your new home is really interesting.

492
00:33:07,110 --> 00:33:08,860
Why didn't you invite me earlier?

493
00:33:31,260 --> 00:33:32,450
Zhu Yan.

494
00:33:33,240 --> 00:33:34,630
Long time no see.

495
00:33:35,660 --> 00:33:37,130
Want a drink?

496
00:33:47,550 --> 00:33:48,460
Brother Zhuo!

497
00:33:48,820 --> 00:33:49,360
Let's go.

498
00:33:49,380 --> 00:33:49,990
Let's drink.

499
00:33:54,400 --> 00:33:55,230
There's wine here.

500
00:33:55,290 --> 00:33:55,990
Here.

501
00:33:56,730 --> 00:33:58,150
Kids can't drink.

502
00:33:59,010 --> 00:33:59,980
You drink this.

503
00:34:00,380 --> 00:34:01,880
Almond buttermilk.

504
00:34:10,270 --> 00:34:11,210
Jiu.

505
00:34:11,469 --> 00:34:12,739
Didn't you say

506
00:34:12,929 --> 00:34:15,290
you regret not cherishing that time?

507
00:34:15,949 --> 00:34:17,580
Why are you still unhappy?

508
00:34:21,219 --> 00:34:22,360
Look carefully.

509
00:34:31,179 --> 00:34:32,280
Let me try again.

510
00:34:33,500 --> 00:34:34,840
You hurt your hand.

511
00:34:35,150 --> 00:34:36,659
Let's call it a day.

512
00:34:37,210 --> 00:34:38,440
It's just a minor injury.

513
00:34:38,540 --> 00:34:39,960
I'm a man.

514
00:34:39,980 --> 00:34:41,320
I can continue.

515
00:34:41,739 --> 00:34:42,929
We have the future ahead of us.

516
00:34:43,480 --> 00:34:45,580
I will teach you archery well.

517
00:34:46,070 --> 00:34:47,500
There's no rush.

518
00:34:48,489 --> 00:34:49,600
Zhao Yuanzhou.

519
00:34:50,989 --> 00:34:52,179
Long time no see.

520
00:34:54,780 --> 00:34:56,340
When old friends meet,

521
00:34:57,390 --> 00:34:58,960
you should drink more.

522
00:35:04,790 --> 00:35:05,710
Great Demon.

523
00:35:07,390 --> 00:35:08,900
Why are you spacing out?

524
00:35:08,960 --> 00:35:11,000
Come and push the swing for me.

525
00:35:25,370 --> 00:35:27,890
♫A lone boat drifts through the world♫

526
00:35:27,910 --> 00:35:30,480
♫The heart feels bitter, then sweet♫

527
00:35:30,830 --> 00:35:35,930
♫Can't distinguish night from day♫

528
00:35:32,370 --> 00:35:33,670
Great Demon,

529
00:35:34,080 --> 00:35:35,480
just help me

530
00:35:35,710 --> 00:35:37,510
push the swing like this forever,

531
00:35:37,150 --> 00:35:39,020
♫At the edge of the dreamscape♫

532
00:35:37,720 --> 00:35:38,950
okay?

533
00:35:39,220 --> 00:35:41,820
♫Someone is longing for♫

534
00:35:42,010 --> 00:35:43,030
♫Softly calling for♫

535
00:35:43,100 --> 00:35:47,140
♫A past that can't be brought back♫

536
00:35:43,510 --> 00:35:44,510
Okay.

537
00:35:44,780 --> 00:35:47,270
Stay here with me forever.

538
00:35:47,560 --> 00:35:50,170
♫The world echoes with a single sigh♫

539
00:35:50,200 --> 00:35:51,640
Look,

540
00:35:50,240 --> 00:35:52,810
♫Love and hate each fills half the heart♫

541
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:53,790
everyone is so happy right now.

542
00:35:53,080 --> 00:35:58,110
♫The years are filled with grudges and grace♫

543
00:35:59,230 --> 00:36:01,310
♫The cry of summer cicadas♫

544
00:36:01,360 --> 00:36:03,990
♫The slumber of winter snow♫

545
00:36:04,210 --> 00:36:09,580
♫No idle wishes and no hopeless longing for eternity♫

546
00:36:09,610 --> 00:36:14,920
♫Who saw the young man in beautiful clothes♫

547
00:36:14,080 --> 00:36:15,420
Didn't you say

548
00:36:15,140 --> 00:36:20,460
♫One step at a time, chasing every yesterday♫

549
00:36:17,090 --> 00:36:18,980
you don't like pushing the swing?

550
00:36:20,930 --> 00:36:22,800
If it's for someone I love,

551
00:36:21,100 --> 00:36:23,660
♫The sun beams down on the world♫

552
00:36:23,810 --> 00:36:26,090
♫Put everything behind♫

553
00:36:23,860 --> 00:36:25,450
I can push it for the rest of my life.

554
00:36:26,390 --> 00:36:31,640
♫You appear in my dream♫

555
00:36:28,630 --> 00:36:30,800
It would be great if we really could stay here

556
00:36:32,630 --> 00:36:33,740
for a lifetime.

557
00:36:36,700 --> 00:36:38,160
But you know

558
00:36:39,240 --> 00:36:40,570
it's impossible.

559
00:36:41,820 --> 00:36:43,100
Of course I know.

560
00:36:44,720 --> 00:36:45,750
It's just that

561
00:36:47,270 --> 00:36:50,170
I want to consciously be delusional for a moment.

562
00:37:11,190 --> 00:37:12,520
It's a dream.

563
00:37:13,340 --> 00:37:16,230
It should be the Poison of Indulgence in Wen Zongyu's fire.

564
00:37:16,300 --> 00:37:17,650
Poison of Indulgence?

565
00:37:18,200 --> 00:37:18,970
Yes.

566
00:37:21,120 --> 00:37:23,330
It's similar to Ran Yi's dream.

567
00:37:24,170 --> 00:37:26,390
This poison will arouse the greatest desire

568
00:37:26,410 --> 00:37:27,900
in our hearts

569
00:37:29,070 --> 00:37:31,060
and make us indulge in it,

570
00:37:32,150 --> 00:37:34,800
trapped in this endless dream.

571
00:37:36,440 --> 00:37:38,610
How can we wake up?

572
00:37:40,270 --> 00:37:41,480
Do you remember

573
00:37:42,940 --> 00:37:44,810
the solution to Ran Yi's dream?

574
00:37:48,990 --> 00:37:50,000
Yes.

575
00:38:06,710 --> 00:38:07,800
What's wrong?

576
00:38:24,350 --> 00:38:25,570
What if...

577
00:38:27,930 --> 00:38:29,530
this isn't a dream?

578
00:38:30,530 --> 00:38:33,240
Zhao Wan'er and Li Lun have long died.

579
00:38:34,570 --> 00:38:36,960
How can this not be a dream?

580
00:38:40,480 --> 00:38:41,730
Zhao Yuanzhou.

581
00:38:42,020 --> 00:38:43,380
Wake up!

582
00:39:09,060 --> 00:39:09,790
Brother Zhuo!

583
00:39:09,790 --> 00:39:10,630
Great Demon!

584
00:39:11,570 --> 00:39:12,270
Jiu?

585
00:39:12,300 --> 00:39:13,300
Why are you here?

586
00:39:13,330 --> 00:39:14,650
I went to Chongwu Camp to find you all.

587
00:39:14,670 --> 00:39:15,790
I heard you were here.

588
00:39:16,060 --> 00:39:17,580
You're the one who detoxified us?

589
00:39:17,600 --> 00:39:18,240
Yes.

590
00:39:18,340 --> 00:39:19,750
Luckily I arrived in time.

591
00:39:20,150 --> 00:39:21,110
Bai Jiu.

592
00:39:22,740 --> 00:39:24,870
Are you going to fight me too?

593
00:39:24,900 --> 00:39:26,620
I know it's beyond my abilities,

594
00:39:26,660 --> 00:39:27,510
but I have to

595
00:39:27,510 --> 00:39:28,990
stand with my friends.

596
00:39:54,980 --> 00:39:56,360
Ridiculous.

597
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:59,440
You don't have much demonic power left.

598
00:39:59,700 --> 00:40:01,410
It's useless like an insect trying to shake a tree.

599
00:40:32,710 --> 00:40:34,470
The inner core is not in his stomach.

600
00:40:34,900 --> 00:40:37,100
He hid the inner core somewhere else.

601
00:40:37,100 --> 00:40:37,910
What should we do?

602
00:40:38,010 --> 00:40:38,990
Only the Truth Eye

603
00:40:38,990 --> 00:40:40,940
or the Golden Pupils of Baize can see it.

604
00:40:41,400 --> 00:40:42,260
Wen Xiao.
