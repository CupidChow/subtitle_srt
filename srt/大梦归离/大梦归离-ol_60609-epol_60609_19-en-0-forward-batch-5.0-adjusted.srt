[Fangs of Fortune]

2
00:01:48,210 --> 00:01:50,930
[Episode 19]

3
00:02:24,510 --> 00:02:27,140
Previously, how many demons

4
00:02:27,550 --> 00:02:30,880
have died in this steel cage smeared with the beast's blood?

5
00:02:32,070 --> 00:02:33,240
You are angry

6
00:02:34,820 --> 00:02:37,430
because you saw that I have everything,

7
00:02:39,060 --> 00:02:41,090
but you have nothing.

8
00:02:42,780 --> 00:02:44,090
That's right.

9
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:47,680
You're the reason

10
00:02:49,670 --> 00:02:51,730
I have nothing.

11
00:02:58,620 --> 00:03:00,220
You killed so many people.

12
00:03:26,030 --> 00:03:27,310
How dare you

13
00:03:30,930 --> 00:03:33,450
hurt me for the sake of

14
00:03:33,540 --> 00:03:35,329
humans who killed us demons?

15
00:03:36,100 --> 00:03:38,960
The ones who hurt demons are the people in prison.

16
00:03:41,230 --> 00:03:44,090
These people here, who are suffering from illness,

17
00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:47,890
are just here to seek medical treatment.

18
00:03:47,890 --> 00:03:49,220
Humans are all the same.

19
00:03:50,220 --> 00:03:51,680
They hate demons

20
00:03:53,030 --> 00:03:54,410
and despise demons.

21
00:03:55,050 --> 00:03:55,950
Li Lun.

22
00:03:57,690 --> 00:03:59,140
You're wrong.

23
00:03:59,790 --> 00:04:01,660
You're the one who's wrong.

24
00:04:04,770 --> 00:04:06,170
Zhao Yuanzhou.

25
00:04:07,010 --> 00:04:11,380
You betrayed the oath to protect the Wilderness first.

26
00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:15,190
I've never betrayed the oath.

27
00:04:16,650 --> 00:04:19,710
It's just that we protect the Wilderness differently.

28
00:04:20,700 --> 00:04:21,959
Even up till now,

29
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:24,720
you still don't understand.

30
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:27,240
Zhao Yuanzhou.

31
00:04:28,650 --> 00:04:31,250
Don't think you're really a human

32
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:34,200
just because you have a mortal name.

33
00:04:35,780 --> 00:04:37,330
You treat them as friends.

34
00:04:38,130 --> 00:04:40,590
But do they really treat you like one of them?

35
00:04:44,110 --> 00:04:44,909
Of course.

36
00:04:45,909 --> 00:04:47,110
Zhao Yuanzhou

37
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:49,060
is my best friend.

38
00:04:51,909 --> 00:04:54,040
He's trying to sow discord between us.

39
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:56,530
Don't listen to him.

40
00:04:57,950 --> 00:04:59,150
I used to be

41
00:05:00,980 --> 00:05:02,740
his best friend too.

42
00:05:06,820 --> 00:05:08,140
Zhao Yuanzhou.

43
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:11,760
You are invincible.

44
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:16,290
Why do you want to be friends with these nobodies?

45
00:05:17,630 --> 00:05:19,140
You wouldn't understand.

46
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:27,270
This Little Bunny may be a crybaby,

47
00:05:27,650 --> 00:05:29,850
but he always risked his life

48
00:05:29,970 --> 00:05:31,830
as we went through thick and thin.

49
00:05:32,700 --> 00:05:34,300
We've been in this together.

50
00:05:35,470 --> 00:05:38,050
Pei Sijing may look cold,

51
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,840
but she's tough on the outside and soft on the inside,

52
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:43,170
and has well-defined likes and dislikes.

53
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:44,630
Thank you.

54
00:05:45,659 --> 00:05:47,000
As for Zhuo Yichen,

55
00:05:50,350 --> 00:05:51,880
I don't want to flatter him,

56
00:05:52,350 --> 00:05:53,840
but he is indeed

57
00:05:54,230 --> 00:05:55,630
a dignified gentleman

58
00:05:56,180 --> 00:05:57,520
with a righteous heart.

59
00:05:58,060 --> 00:05:59,520
He has an unbreakable will

60
00:06:00,570 --> 00:06:02,430
and a character as strong as gold.

61
00:06:04,490 --> 00:06:05,750
As for Wen Xiao,

62
00:06:06,510 --> 00:06:09,110
when everyone was treating me as an evil demon

63
00:06:10,390 --> 00:06:11,390
and had feared me,

64
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:13,520
hated me,

65
00:06:15,060 --> 00:06:16,550
or respected me,

66
00:06:19,750 --> 00:06:20,810
she was the only one

67
00:06:21,970 --> 00:06:25,020
who still looked at me with warmth and sympathy.

68
00:06:25,060 --> 00:06:25,870
Zhuo,

69
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:29,090
this isn't his true intention.

70
00:06:29,210 --> 00:06:31,670
He's being controlled by malicious energy.

71
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:34,220
Li Lun.

72
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:37,790
After all these years,

73
00:06:39,620 --> 00:06:41,620
you still don't understand.

74
00:06:43,350 --> 00:06:44,770
Okay.

75
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:48,030
Fine.

76
00:06:52,520 --> 00:06:54,840
Since you value them so much,

77
00:06:57,310 --> 00:06:59,860
I'll let you witness

78
00:07:00,210 --> 00:07:01,940
your most precious friends

79
00:07:01,980 --> 00:07:03,460
die one by one.

80
00:07:05,630 --> 00:07:07,790
Didn't you say I have nothing?

81
00:07:10,310 --> 00:07:11,390
Don't worry.

82
00:07:13,070 --> 00:07:14,320
Soon,

83
00:07:17,060 --> 00:07:18,960
you will be just like me.

84
00:07:23,270 --> 00:07:24,180
Let him go!

85
00:07:24,460 --> 00:07:26,170
He's the first one.

86
00:07:30,580 --> 00:07:31,450
Jiu!

87
00:07:49,870 --> 00:07:50,870
What is this?

88
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:52,659
Divine power.

89
00:07:53,710 --> 00:07:54,630
Divine power?

90
00:07:55,640 --> 00:07:57,730
Why would Jiu possess divine power?

91
00:08:00,640 --> 00:08:02,790
I've underestimated you.

92
00:08:06,940 --> 00:08:08,270
But...

93
00:08:09,540 --> 00:08:12,600
this is indeed a great gift.

94
00:08:18,070 --> 00:08:18,680
Take it.

95
00:08:18,950 --> 00:08:19,730
Pei Sijing.

96
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:20,600
Zhuo.

97
00:08:20,620 --> 00:08:22,080
Quick, get Jiu out of here.

98
00:08:24,630 --> 00:08:25,350
Jiu.

99
00:08:50,870 --> 00:08:51,890
Zhuo Yichen!

100
00:08:58,350 --> 00:08:58,950
Jiu!

101
00:09:00,290 --> 00:09:00,880
Jiu!

102
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:06,980
Have you found Yao Water and Divine Wood?

103
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:10,660
Shut up!

104
00:09:17,700 --> 00:09:18,780
Wen Xiao!

105
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,230
Zhao Yuanzhou.

106
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:28,920
It seems that Baize Goddess

107
00:09:28,950 --> 00:09:31,300
is deeply in love with you.

108
00:09:32,830 --> 00:09:34,680
She blocked

109
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:36,960
all of the curse.

110
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:49,620
If the blood of Baize runs out,

111
00:10:51,460 --> 00:10:52,980
will there still be

112
00:10:55,270 --> 00:10:58,550
another Baize Goddess?

113
00:11:11,230 --> 00:11:12,860
The game is not over yet.

114
00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:16,020
This time it's one or the other again.

115
00:11:17,660 --> 00:11:18,870
Zhao Yuanzhou.

116
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:21,700
Who will you choose this time?

117
00:11:23,410 --> 00:11:24,810
No need for him to choose.

118
00:11:25,280 --> 00:11:26,340
I'll choose first.

119
00:11:27,080 --> 00:11:27,900
Oh?

120
00:11:28,570 --> 00:11:30,340
I choose for you to die.

121
00:11:34,020 --> 00:11:34,900
Wen Xiao!

122
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:00,840
Stay here.

123
00:12:00,860 --> 00:12:02,260
I'll go help Zhuo Yichen.

124
00:12:02,510 --> 00:12:03,140
Okay.

125
00:12:36,350 --> 00:12:38,480
I didn't expect the umbrella I gave you

126
00:12:39,990 --> 00:12:42,420
would end up pointing at me.

127
00:12:44,510 --> 00:12:46,800
That's why we never give our good friends

128
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:48,970
umbrellas in the mortal world.

129
00:12:49,780 --> 00:12:51,110
Because umbrellas mean

130
00:12:51,730 --> 00:12:53,060
to go our separate ways.

131
00:12:53,810 --> 00:12:55,380
You chose the umbrella.

132
00:12:56,430 --> 00:12:57,830
It's also your own choice

133
00:12:58,670 --> 00:13:00,580
to go our separate ways.

134
00:13:45,960 --> 00:13:47,020
Malicious energy?

135
00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:53,600
Zhao Yuanzhou.

136
00:13:55,630 --> 00:13:58,840
You're willing to go this far for them.

137
00:14:00,670 --> 00:14:01,520
Li Lun.

138
00:14:02,460 --> 00:14:05,590
Haven't you wanted me to settle my blood debts all along?

139
00:14:06,220 --> 00:14:06,990
How is this?

140
00:14:07,650 --> 00:14:09,510
I now carry blood with malicious energy.

141
00:14:09,510 --> 00:14:10,910
Isn't that great?

142
00:15:00,130 --> 00:15:01,380
Stop!

143
00:15:04,230 --> 00:15:04,910
Wen Xiao!

144
00:15:41,180 --> 00:15:41,950
Li Lun?

145
00:15:43,420 --> 00:15:44,510
That's right.

146
00:15:46,550 --> 00:15:48,230
As you can see,

147
00:15:49,450 --> 00:15:51,160
I am who I am today

148
00:15:52,090 --> 00:15:54,360
because of you.

149
00:15:54,610 --> 00:15:56,380
Back then, the Ever-Burning Wood

150
00:15:56,380 --> 00:15:58,420
had already entered your body.

151
00:15:59,320 --> 00:16:02,760
Your skills also carried the power of the Ever-Burning Wood

152
00:16:03,670 --> 00:16:05,550
and had hurt me too.

153
00:16:13,240 --> 00:16:14,320
At that time,

154
00:16:16,640 --> 00:16:17,930
I didn't know...

155
00:16:21,350 --> 00:16:22,610
Ever-Burning Wood...

156
00:16:24,290 --> 00:16:25,450
The Ever-Burning Wood

157
00:16:25,450 --> 00:16:26,870
is a sacred wood

158
00:16:26,870 --> 00:16:28,940
that grows in the Wilderness.

159
00:16:29,630 --> 00:16:31,190
It won't die out even during storms,

160
00:16:31,190 --> 00:16:32,660
and its fire never ceases.

161
00:16:34,310 --> 00:16:36,500
Burns from the Ever-Burning Wood

162
00:16:37,820 --> 00:16:39,420
are incurable.

163
00:16:42,390 --> 00:16:44,660
You gave me agony

164
00:16:44,660 --> 00:16:46,870
that I can never recover from.

165
00:16:50,270 --> 00:16:51,070
Li Lun.

166
00:16:54,810 --> 00:16:57,740
I didn't mean to hurt you with the Ever-Burning Wood.

167
00:17:02,910 --> 00:17:04,070
It's my fault.

168
00:17:07,710 --> 00:17:10,490
Li Lun has taken so many lives in the mortal world.

169
00:17:11,030 --> 00:17:12,359
His sins are plentiful.

170
00:17:12,650 --> 00:17:14,690
We must seal him forever.

171
00:17:15,579 --> 00:17:17,440
Back then, Li Lun and I

172
00:17:17,839 --> 00:17:20,440
used magic to rebuild the White Emperor Tower,

173
00:17:21,089 --> 00:17:23,589
and we swore to protect the Wilderness.

174
00:17:24,060 --> 00:17:25,760
His love for the Wilderness

175
00:17:26,190 --> 00:17:27,750
is deeper than anyone else.

176
00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:30,400
But fate played a cruel joke.

177
00:17:31,060 --> 00:17:33,640
Both of you were scalded by the Ever-Burning Wood,

178
00:17:33,640 --> 00:17:36,740
with you as the vessel of malicious energy,

179
00:17:37,390 --> 00:17:40,790
and him, who was most afraid of being scalded as a locust tree.

180
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,020
Even if I don't punish Li Lun,

181
00:17:43,350 --> 00:17:45,490
he will burn to ashes

182
00:17:45,710 --> 00:17:47,520
because of the Ever-Burning Wood

183
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:48,940
and eventually perish.

184
00:17:49,460 --> 00:17:52,300
Therefore, he was imprisoned at the Place of Birth.

185
00:17:52,300 --> 00:17:53,470
Although to him,

186
00:17:53,470 --> 00:17:55,530
it may seem to be an endless sentence,

187
00:17:55,630 --> 00:17:57,160
it's actually a good thing.

188
00:17:57,450 --> 00:17:59,760
Under the Baize Imperial Order,

189
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:03,430
the curse of the Ever-Burning Wood will also fail.

190
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:06,980
He won't have to endure endless burns,

191
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:09,860
and he can still survive.

192
00:18:16,560 --> 00:18:17,770
Ridiculous.

193
00:18:19,350 --> 00:18:21,880
To be trapped in a confined space for eternity

194
00:18:21,910 --> 00:18:23,270
is worse than death.

195
00:18:23,290 --> 00:18:25,020
I am just a worthless prisoner.

196
00:18:25,170 --> 00:18:26,660
What's the point?

197
00:18:27,820 --> 00:18:30,420
I'd rather be burned to ashes

198
00:18:32,110 --> 00:18:34,110
and spread across heaven and earth.

199
00:18:37,890 --> 00:18:39,790
Baize Goddess.

200
00:18:44,520 --> 00:18:45,880
This is all your fault.

201
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:48,160
It's always your fault.

202
00:18:57,400 --> 00:18:59,250
A life without death.

203
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:06,990
You will kill him one day.

204
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:10,620
Do you think you would have won...

205
00:19:24,410 --> 00:19:26,520
just because you killed Zhou Yuanzhou?

206
00:19:26,520 --> 00:19:27,970
Without Divine Wood

207
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:30,110
and Yao Water,

208
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:34,560
there's no way to repair the Baize Token.

209
00:19:36,990 --> 00:19:38,750
Everything is destined.

210
00:19:42,170 --> 00:19:43,410
Zhao Yuanzhou.

211
00:19:44,930 --> 00:19:48,590
The day the malicious energy in your body goes out of control again

212
00:19:49,870 --> 00:19:53,400
shall be the day the mortal world gets buried with you.

213
00:19:56,180 --> 00:19:57,430
By then,

214
00:19:59,080 --> 00:20:00,880
I wonder if your friends

215
00:20:02,630 --> 00:20:04,200
will choose to kill you

216
00:20:06,790 --> 00:20:08,960
or die with you.

217
00:20:45,220 --> 00:20:46,460
Zhao Yuanzhou.

218
00:22:28,980 --> 00:22:31,040
If you want to repair the Baize Token,

219
00:22:31,230 --> 00:22:32,820
we must use the purest and

220
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:34,440
cleanest Yao Water.

221
00:22:35,350 --> 00:22:36,830
But now, the Yao Water

222
00:22:37,230 --> 00:22:40,010
has been polluted by Li Lun

223
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:41,880
with the blood of Baize Goddess.

224
00:22:41,900 --> 00:22:44,230
I'm afraid it has lost its effectiveness.

225
00:22:46,370 --> 00:22:47,950
Let's put it away first.

226
00:22:49,190 --> 00:22:51,120
Maybe we'll find a way to purify it.

227
00:22:52,650 --> 00:22:54,620
Even if we can purify the Yao Water,

228
00:22:56,420 --> 00:22:57,800
Li Lun said

229
00:22:57,970 --> 00:22:59,870
the Divine Wood no longer exists.

230
00:23:00,130 --> 00:23:02,600
How will we repair the Baize Token?

231
00:23:06,560 --> 00:23:08,400
Don’t worry, Mr. Zhuo.

232
00:23:09,270 --> 00:23:10,590
One month later,

233
00:23:10,630 --> 00:23:12,890
if we still can’t repair the Baize Token,

234
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:14,920
you can just kill me.

235
00:23:16,680 --> 00:23:18,890
I can use all my divine power

236
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:21,490
to suppress Zhao Yuanzhou's malicious energy

237
00:23:21,490 --> 00:23:22,900
for a month at most.

238
00:23:25,880 --> 00:23:28,220
We just fought together.

239
00:23:28,690 --> 00:23:30,810
Now, you are asking someone to kill you.

240
00:23:30,810 --> 00:23:32,610
You demons are truly heartless.

241
00:23:33,670 --> 00:23:36,070
I also hope you could be equally heartless.

242
00:23:36,610 --> 00:23:38,300
Because people with hearts

243
00:23:39,290 --> 00:23:40,620
live in misery.

244
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:44,880
You lack a heart.

245
00:23:45,510 --> 00:23:47,440
But aren't you living in agony too?

246
00:23:48,330 --> 00:23:49,530
Nature is merciless,

247
00:23:49,800 --> 00:23:51,100
and all beings suffer.

248
00:23:51,710 --> 00:23:53,870
Since we are born into this world,

249
00:23:55,280 --> 00:23:56,670
we should all live well.

250
00:23:59,630 --> 00:24:01,150
Zhuo is right.

251
00:24:02,410 --> 00:24:04,590
You mustn't always think about dying.

252
00:24:05,230 --> 00:24:07,630
And have you forgotten the pact between us?

253
00:24:07,690 --> 00:24:10,550
You still have to work for the Demon Hunting Bureau.

254
00:24:11,690 --> 00:24:13,550
The Baizen Token remains broken,

255
00:24:14,030 --> 00:24:16,430
and the Wilderness still needs to be saved.

256
00:24:17,320 --> 00:24:19,680
You haven't paid off your debt.

257
00:24:21,530 --> 00:24:22,840
It won't be that easy.

258
00:24:26,360 --> 00:24:27,340
Fine.

259
00:24:30,380 --> 00:24:31,910
But we are still enemies...

260
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:35,460
but also colleagues.

261
00:24:41,190 --> 00:24:42,120
Thank you.

262
00:24:43,420 --> 00:24:44,550
What for?

263
00:24:45,040 --> 00:24:46,530
I'm thanking Ms. Wen Xiao.

264
00:24:47,080 --> 00:24:47,710
You!

265
00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:14,050
This is Mount Kunlun.

266
00:25:14,340 --> 00:25:15,720
What are you mortals

267
00:25:15,750 --> 00:25:16,840
doing here?

268
00:25:17,570 --> 00:25:19,820
It is said that the Demon Hunting Bureau and Chongwu Camp

269
00:25:19,820 --> 00:25:21,230
are never on good terms.

270
00:25:21,570 --> 00:25:22,790
But this time,

271
00:25:22,930 --> 00:25:24,550
we have the same goal.

272
00:25:26,040 --> 00:25:27,470
What exactly do you want?

273
00:25:29,350 --> 00:25:31,340
Arrest Zhao Yuanzhou.

274
00:25:33,430 --> 00:25:34,900
Zhao Yuanzhou is not here.

275
00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:36,940
Who said I'm not here?

276
00:25:42,230 --> 00:25:42,950
Wow.

277
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:44,960
What's with the big reception?

278
00:25:51,190 --> 00:25:51,990
Guards.

279
00:25:52,870 --> 00:25:54,810
Arrest Zhao Yuanzhou.

280
00:25:55,460 --> 00:25:56,490
Mr. Zhen Mei.

281
00:25:57,220 --> 00:25:58,900
My godfather, Mr. Fan Ying,

282
00:25:58,920 --> 00:26:00,600
is your equal in rank.

283
00:26:01,150 --> 00:26:02,950
Chongwu Camp and Demon Hunting Bureau

284
00:26:02,950 --> 00:26:05,480
are neither in a hierarchical relationship.

285
00:26:05,970 --> 00:26:07,050
How about

286
00:26:07,690 --> 00:26:08,390
we leave it to

287
00:26:08,390 --> 00:26:11,110
a fair and open third party,

288
00:26:11,850 --> 00:26:13,470
the Prime Minister's representative,

289
00:26:13,470 --> 00:26:15,530
Ms. Pei Sijing, to make the decision?

290
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:23,440
Sure.

291
00:26:29,830 --> 00:26:32,290
Zhao Yuanzhou shall be at the disposal of...

292
00:26:34,730 --> 00:26:36,010
Chongwu Camp.

293
00:26:42,580 --> 00:26:43,630
Ms. Pei?

294
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:45,380
It's okay.

295
00:26:45,640 --> 00:26:47,130
I am interested to see

296
00:26:47,510 --> 00:26:49,670
whether the Demon Hunting Bureau's prison cell

297
00:26:49,670 --> 00:26:52,000
is more comfortable than Chongwu Camp's.

298
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:53,440
Mr. Zhen Mei.

299
00:26:55,080 --> 00:26:56,480
I await your punishment.

300
00:26:58,830 --> 00:26:59,630
Are you crazy?

301
00:27:01,770 --> 00:27:02,580
Don't worry.

302
00:27:26,340 --> 00:27:27,960
Almond buttermilk?

303
00:27:32,100 --> 00:27:33,020
Jiu.

304
00:27:33,190 --> 00:27:34,350
You've grown up.

305
00:27:34,860 --> 00:27:36,020
There are a lot of things

306
00:27:36,020 --> 00:27:38,270
Daddy shouldn't keep from you anymore.

307
00:27:38,290 --> 00:27:39,630
When you return to Tiandu,

308
00:27:39,630 --> 00:27:40,890
come and look for me.

309
00:27:40,990 --> 00:27:43,080
I'll take you to see your mother

310
00:27:43,110 --> 00:27:45,030
and tell you everything.

311
00:27:54,790 --> 00:27:55,580
My child.

312
00:27:56,900 --> 00:27:59,740
There are three thousand paths to arrive in this world,

313
00:27:59,740 --> 00:28:01,980
and there are thirty thousand paths for your return.

314
00:28:01,980 --> 00:28:04,750
As for which one is right for you,

315
00:28:05,660 --> 00:28:07,320
you have to find out yourself.

316
00:28:10,030 --> 00:28:10,830
Ying Lei.

317
00:28:17,460 --> 00:28:18,260
Mr. Lu Wu?

318
00:28:18,800 --> 00:28:20,980
I was initially stationed at Zhongshan.

319
00:28:20,980 --> 00:28:22,930
I heard that Mr. Ying Zhao had died,

320
00:28:22,970 --> 00:28:24,210
so I rushed over

321
00:28:24,420 --> 00:28:26,380
to guard Mount Kunlun with you.

322
00:28:26,790 --> 00:28:27,830
So Grandpa

323
00:28:27,970 --> 00:28:29,700
had already prepared for this.

324
00:28:33,320 --> 00:28:34,590
Thank you, Mr. Lu Wu.

325
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:37,800
I'll try my best

326
00:28:38,670 --> 00:28:39,930
to become

327
00:28:39,950 --> 00:28:41,080
a good Mountain God.

328
00:28:45,330 --> 00:28:46,560
Mr. Lu Wu.

329
00:28:46,930 --> 00:28:48,660
I have a favor to ask.

330
00:28:48,690 --> 00:28:49,260
Oh?

331
00:28:49,280 --> 00:28:50,190
Tell me.

332
00:28:52,320 --> 00:28:54,600
Do you know how to purify Yao Water?

333
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:07,280
Watch him closely.

334
00:29:07,630 --> 00:29:09,030
If anything goes wrong,

335
00:29:09,140 --> 00:29:10,530
you will be beheaded.

336
00:29:10,710 --> 00:29:11,220
Yes.

337
00:29:40,680 --> 00:29:42,810
They are to execute Zhao Yuanzhou now?

338
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:45,460
It's the Prime Minister's secret order.

339
00:29:46,510 --> 00:29:48,370
He must be executed immediately.

340
00:29:48,560 --> 00:29:50,380
Then let them do it.

341
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:52,610
They can't kill Zhao Yuanzhou anyway.

342
00:29:53,030 --> 00:29:55,160
At most, he'll suffer a little.

343
00:29:55,740 --> 00:29:58,110
That's why I called you here late at night.

344
00:29:59,660 --> 00:30:01,060
The Prime Minister knows

345
00:30:01,110 --> 00:30:03,510
only your Cloud Light Sword can kill him.

346
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:06,560
He has specially ordered

347
00:30:07,550 --> 00:30:10,780
you to execute Zhao Yuanzhou.

348
00:30:12,520 --> 00:30:13,430
Zhuo.

349
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:15,600
The greater good is at stake.

350
00:30:15,640 --> 00:30:17,470
That's exactly why

351
00:30:18,740 --> 00:30:20,540
I shouldn't kill Zhao Yuanzhou.

352
00:30:22,790 --> 00:30:23,700
At least,

353
00:30:24,330 --> 00:30:25,410
not now.

354
00:30:26,860 --> 00:30:27,740
Are you crazy?

355
00:30:30,100 --> 00:30:30,970
Don't worry.

356
00:30:33,810 --> 00:30:35,970
[See you at Tiandu]

357
00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:40,890
Zhuo,

358
00:30:41,460 --> 00:30:44,120
haven't you always wanted to kill Zhao Yuanzhou

359
00:30:45,090 --> 00:30:47,170
and avenge your father and brother?

360
00:30:52,420 --> 00:30:54,820
Zhao Yuanzhou killed my father and brother

361
00:30:55,030 --> 00:30:57,560
under the influence of his malicious energy.

362
00:30:58,260 --> 00:30:59,630
The real murderer

363
00:31:00,950 --> 00:31:03,880
is the malicious energy that transverses the world.

364
00:31:04,910 --> 00:31:06,160
And Zhao Yuanzhou

365
00:31:07,150 --> 00:31:08,480
happens to be the blade.

366
00:31:10,790 --> 00:31:12,210
These days,

367
00:31:12,420 --> 00:31:13,810
travelling with him,

368
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:17,640
I saw a different side of him.

369
00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:20,400
He is indeed

370
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:23,380
a compassionate and righteous demon.

371
00:31:27,260 --> 00:31:28,210
So,

372
00:31:29,130 --> 00:31:31,190
you are no longer willing to kill him?

373
00:31:31,800 --> 00:31:32,860
A knife's morality

374
00:31:33,260 --> 00:31:34,830
is determined by

375
00:31:35,300 --> 00:31:37,020
the hand that holds it.

376
00:31:39,930 --> 00:31:41,660
The two realms are in turmoil,

377
00:31:41,910 --> 00:31:43,830
and the Wilderness is in danger.

378
00:31:44,390 --> 00:31:47,650
We must repair the damaged Baize Token as soon as possible.

379
00:31:48,040 --> 00:31:50,070
We need Zhao Yuanzhou’s help.

380
00:31:51,550 --> 00:31:53,310
The Baize Token is broken?

381
00:31:55,080 --> 00:31:58,480
Then all the more we must execute Zhao Yuanzhou immediately.

382
00:32:00,130 --> 00:32:02,560
No wonder Prime Minister did not dare to risk it,

383
00:32:02,560 --> 00:32:04,100
and even more so for myself.

384
00:32:04,120 --> 00:32:04,920
Mr. Fan.

385
00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:06,780
Say no more.

386
00:32:06,810 --> 00:32:07,870
This is the Prime Minister's order.

387
00:32:07,870 --> 00:32:09,070
You must carry it out.

388
00:32:09,110 --> 00:32:10,030
Father.

389
00:32:10,060 --> 00:32:11,080
The Prime Minister is being unreasonable.

390
00:32:11,080 --> 00:32:13,140
Are you going to be unreasonable too?

391
00:32:13,840 --> 00:32:14,640
Xiao.

392
00:32:16,350 --> 00:32:18,250
Xiao, you mustn't speak recklessly about the Prime Minister.

393
00:32:18,250 --> 00:32:19,720
Prime Minister has the world in his heart.

394
00:32:19,720 --> 00:32:21,530
How could he disregard the safety of the people

395
00:32:21,530 --> 00:32:23,110
and leave behind endless troubles?

396
00:32:23,110 --> 00:32:23,630
Fine.

397
00:32:23,990 --> 00:32:26,190
I'll talk to the Prime Minister myself.

398
00:32:26,250 --> 00:32:26,860
Wen Xiao!

399
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:27,400
Xiao!

400
00:32:27,510 --> 00:32:28,070
Xiao!

401
00:32:28,270 --> 00:32:28,990
Stop her!

402
00:32:52,680 --> 00:32:53,730
Brother!

403
00:32:55,140 --> 00:32:56,460
Zhu Jian's blood...

404
00:32:57,820 --> 00:33:00,340
How many demons

405
00:33:00,830 --> 00:33:04,160
have died in this steel cage smeared with the beast's blood?

406
00:33:40,270 --> 00:33:46,850
[Book of Rites]

407
00:33:52,190 --> 00:33:54,150
I didn't ask Mr. Torch Dragon

408
00:33:54,150 --> 00:33:55,380
to help me become the top student in the imperial exam.

409
00:33:55,380 --> 00:33:56,490
I relied on my own abilities

410
00:33:56,490 --> 00:33:58,750
to go to the capital for the examination.

411
00:34:06,030 --> 00:34:09,950
You proposed to the court to rebuild the Demon Hunting Bureau.

412
00:34:10,540 --> 00:34:13,540
Although the Prime Minister strongly vouched for it,

413
00:34:14,159 --> 00:34:16,520
the Chongwu Camp is interfering.

414
00:34:16,710 --> 00:34:17,570
Chongwu Camp

415
00:34:17,590 --> 00:34:19,300
exaggerated and twisted the truth.

416
00:34:19,300 --> 00:34:21,159
Fortunately, the Prime Minister pleaded for us,

417
00:34:21,159 --> 00:34:22,449
and got us

418
00:34:22,489 --> 00:34:23,889
one last day of pardon.

419
00:34:53,739 --> 00:34:55,120
Who are you?

420
00:34:55,630 --> 00:34:57,030
Why are you kneeling?

421
00:35:01,469 --> 00:35:03,470
Prime Minister, please forgive me.

422
00:35:04,640 --> 00:35:07,040
I'm Wen Xiao from the Demon Hunting Bureau.

423
00:35:07,510 --> 00:35:09,550
I stopped your carriage

424
00:35:10,350 --> 00:35:11,730
because...

425
00:35:12,780 --> 00:35:14,910
I have something important to ask for.

426
00:35:49,120 --> 00:35:51,410
Thank you for your cooperation, Ms. Pei.

427
00:35:51,750 --> 00:35:55,280
It's thanks to you that our collaboration can be this flawless.

428
00:35:56,410 --> 00:35:58,390
Stall them in Sinan Water Town.

429
00:35:58,410 --> 00:35:59,610
Can you do it?

430
00:36:01,340 --> 00:36:02,310
It has to be

431
00:36:02,740 --> 00:36:03,960
just the right time.

432
00:36:04,130 --> 00:36:05,590
Three or four days will do.

433
00:36:18,280 --> 00:36:20,130
What did Zhen Mei offer as a deal

434
00:36:20,670 --> 00:36:22,540
for you to be a mole?

435
00:36:25,870 --> 00:36:26,750
My brother.

436
00:36:28,850 --> 00:36:30,390
Isn't your brother...

437
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:34,520
Zhen Mei spoke to me just now.

438
00:36:35,470 --> 00:36:36,980
He said he faked his death.

439
00:36:38,340 --> 00:36:39,790
He's still alive.

440
00:36:39,980 --> 00:36:41,640
If I ever want to see him again,

441
00:36:43,080 --> 00:36:44,840
I have to work for them.

442
00:36:45,600 --> 00:36:47,150
But you clearly know that

443
00:36:48,120 --> 00:36:49,180
your brother

444
00:36:50,360 --> 00:36:51,550
is indeed dead.

445
00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:04,130
I know.

446
00:37:09,240 --> 00:37:10,910
I used Chaotic Impermanence

447
00:37:10,960 --> 00:37:12,950
to let you see your brother again.

448
00:37:13,760 --> 00:37:15,760
Although he exists only as a puppet,

449
00:37:16,130 --> 00:37:18,000
you still owe me a favor.

450
00:37:18,750 --> 00:37:19,990
Ms. Pei,

451
00:37:20,420 --> 00:37:22,340
shouldn't you also help me?

452
00:37:28,390 --> 00:37:30,120
What do you want me to do for you?

453
00:37:31,070 --> 00:37:33,070
Just keep pretending to be his mole,

454
00:37:33,640 --> 00:37:35,510
so that I can

455
00:37:35,630 --> 00:37:37,710
find out the secrets of Chongwu Camp.

456
00:37:39,100 --> 00:37:39,900
Okay.

457
00:37:40,990 --> 00:37:42,980
Should I tell Wen Xiao and Mr. Zhuo?

458
00:37:45,070 --> 00:37:45,860
No.

459
00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:48,940
You don't even trust Wen Xiao.

460
00:37:52,470 --> 00:37:54,910
I don't want to put her in any danger.

461
00:37:55,470 --> 00:37:56,530
Besides,

462
00:37:56,850 --> 00:37:59,300
making Wen Xiao and Zhuo angry

463
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:01,400
will make our plan

464
00:38:01,760 --> 00:38:03,760
seem more realistic and trustable.

465
00:38:07,820 --> 00:38:09,280
You demon

466
00:38:11,300 --> 00:38:12,580
are really evil.

467
00:38:20,100 --> 00:38:21,900
Tomorrow, the blood moon rises.

468
00:38:22,440 --> 00:38:23,870
Would anything go wrong

469
00:38:24,490 --> 00:38:26,100
with this formation?

470
00:38:27,600 --> 00:38:29,450
I hope I'm not mistaken.

471
00:38:30,920 --> 00:38:33,490
The formation requires the help of two Mountain Gods.

472
00:38:33,490 --> 00:38:35,020
I've got it all figured out.

473
00:38:35,360 --> 00:38:37,560
To prevent someone from destroying it,

474
00:38:38,880 --> 00:38:40,140
when necessary,

475
00:38:40,170 --> 00:38:42,460
I'll let Ying Lei play it by ear.

476
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:44,030
After all,

477
00:38:44,210 --> 00:38:47,410
even though he's young, he's still a Mountain God anyway.

478
00:38:51,040 --> 00:38:52,450
By the way, Sister Pei,

479
00:38:52,470 --> 00:38:53,600
where are you going?

480
00:38:54,250 --> 00:38:56,980
The Chongwu Camp is great at tracking.

481
00:38:57,530 --> 00:38:58,940
For safety's sake,

482
00:38:58,960 --> 00:39:00,530
I’ll patrol around.

483
00:39:01,630 --> 00:39:03,510
Ms. Pei, you're really something.

484
00:39:03,510 --> 00:39:05,220
You actually found me here.

485
00:39:05,640 --> 00:39:06,600
Who are you?

486
00:39:07,110 --> 00:39:08,460

00:39:17,630 --> 00:39:18,260
we leave it to

495
00:39:21,560 --> 00:39:22,920
to make the decision?

496
00:39:23,370 --> 00:39:25,630
Zhao Yuanzhou shall be at the disposal of

497
00:39:25,640 --> 00:39:27,260
Chongwu Camp.

498
00:39:32,450 --> 00:39:33,540
Ms. Pei.

00:39:34,560 --> 00:39:36,090
it's time to reel in the net.

Otherwise,

504
00:40:01,860 --> 00:40:03,870
I really wouldn't know how to get out of this

prison cell smeared with the beast's blood.

506

Rumor has it that

507
00:40:09,870 --> 00:40:11,350
the demons captured were

508
00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:14,050
used for research by the mysterious advisor.

509
00:40:16,420 --> 00:40:17,570
Eight years ago,

510
00:40:18,130 --> 00:40:20,590
Li Lun and I were playing in the mortal world.

511
00:40:21,500 --> 00:40:23,830
One time, we took shelter in Jixin Clinic.

512
00:40:24,410 --> 00:40:26,070
I accidentally found out that

513
00:40:26,310 --> 00:40:28,570
there was a dungeon hidden underground.

514
00:40:29,260 --> 00:40:31,550
It's very similar to the layout here.

515
00:40:33,190 --> 00:40:33,900
It should also be designed

516
00:40:33,900 --> 00:40:36,150
by this mysterious advisor.

517
00:40:40,900 --> 00:40:42,500
Now, we have solid evidence.

518
00:40:42,750 --> 00:40:44,850
I want to report it to the Prime Minister.

519
00:40:44,850 --> 00:40:47,060
I seldom have guests here.

520
00:40:53,390 --> 00:40:55,020
Stop playing tricks.

521
00:40:55,790 --> 00:40:57,540
I know who you are.

522
00:40:57,800 --> 00:41:00,760
Take off that ugly mask of yours,

523
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:03,320
Mr. Wen Zongyu.

524
00:41:05,390 --> 00:41:06,600
You've guessed it.

525
00:41:08,040 --> 00:41:09,700
During the case of the plague,

526
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:12,880
you gave yourself a reason to appear at Sinan Water Town.

527
00:41:12,880 --> 00:41:14,180
I'm Wen Zongyu.

528
00:41:14,600 --> 00:41:16,150
Nice to meet you, Mr. Zhuo.

529
00:41:16,170 --> 00:41:17,370
Right after you left,

530
00:41:17,820 --> 00:41:20,240
a mysterious man took Zhuo away.

531
00:41:25,920 --> 00:41:27,120
Just because of this?

532
00:41:28,920 --> 00:41:30,390
Eight years ago,

533
00:41:31,620 --> 00:41:34,150
you were the doctor in charge of Jixin Clinic.

534
00:41:36,280 --> 00:41:39,110
In the secret dungeon under Jixin Clinic,

535
00:41:39,140 --> 00:41:41,590
all the dirty deeds there

536
00:41:42,510 --> 00:41:44,110
were also your doing, right?

537
00:42:09,130 --> 00:42:11,100
I underestimated you,

538
00:42:12,080 --> 00:42:13,670
Zhao Yuanzhou.

539
00:42:15,990 --> 00:42:17,330
What do you want to do

540
00:42:17,900 --> 00:42:19,160
with all these demons?

541
00:42:20,600 --> 00:42:22,980
It's only natural to kill them if they're caught.

542
00:42:22,980 --> 00:42:25,580
But that's not my only wish.

543
00:42:25,830 --> 00:42:27,710
I hope one day

544
00:42:28,550 --> 00:42:31,060
I'll kill all the demons in the world.

545
00:42:32,130 --> 00:42:33,380
Zhao Yuanzhou.

546
00:42:33,510 --> 00:42:35,510
I've always wanted your inner core.

547
00:42:36,010 --> 00:42:39,390
I didn't expect you to come here in person today.

548
00:42:40,310 --> 00:42:42,350
You're just a mere mortal.

549
00:42:43,200 --> 00:42:45,610
How dare you take my inner core?

550
00:42:46,170 --> 00:42:48,370
Aren't you afraid of hurting yourself?

551
00:42:48,600 --> 00:42:50,460
Indeed, it's a challenging task.

552
00:42:51,620 --> 00:42:54,960
But I heard as long as the demon's five senses are sealed,

553
00:42:55,570 --> 00:42:58,370
its inner core will automatically leave its body.

554
00:42:59,040 --> 00:43:01,280
I have affected your sense of taste,

555
00:43:02,420 --> 00:43:03,010
smell,

556
00:43:03,800 --> 00:43:04,630
sight,

557
00:43:05,100 --> 00:43:05,980
and voice.

558
00:43:06,510 --> 00:43:08,640
Haven't you noticed?

559
00:43:15,870 --> 00:43:17,380
So it was him.

560
00:43:19,180 --> 00:43:20,310
What?

561
00:43:20,770 --> 00:43:21,540
Who is it?

562
00:43:23,270 --> 00:43:24,470
Ms. Pei.

563
00:43:25,890 --> 00:43:28,150
Looks like you're destined to be cheated

564
00:43:28,660 --> 00:43:31,210
by your brother for your whole life.
