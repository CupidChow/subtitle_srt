[Fangs of Fortune]

2
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:46,020
[Episode 28]

3
00:01:46,090 --> 00:01:48,590
Princess Longyu has a bad temper

4
00:01:48,710 --> 00:01:50,740
and hates to see people,

5
00:01:50,910 --> 00:01:52,539
especially men.

6
00:01:52,700 --> 00:01:54,430
So, we had to let Zhuo and the others

7
00:01:54,430 --> 00:01:56,229
stay in the White Emperor Tower.

8
00:01:57,120 --> 00:01:58,590
Am I not a man?

9
00:01:58,950 --> 00:02:00,450
You're an ape.

10
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:03,550
Whenever you need me,

11
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:05,940
I'll come to your aid.

12
00:02:10,310 --> 00:02:11,110
Well,

13
00:02:11,970 --> 00:02:14,300
I wanted to eavesdrop on Princess Longyu,

14
00:02:14,390 --> 00:02:16,450
so I cast a spell on Mr. Zhuo and the others

15
00:02:16,450 --> 00:02:17,570
to carry voices

16
00:02:17,829 --> 00:02:19,200
to their ears.

17
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:21,290
But now,

18
00:02:21,590 --> 00:02:23,640
they heard our words of love.

19
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:25,900
It's embarrassing.

20
00:02:27,590 --> 00:02:29,480
Shame on you, Zhao Yuanzhou.

21
00:02:29,550 --> 00:02:30,520
Bastard!

22
00:02:31,990 --> 00:02:33,440
He's talking nonsense!

23
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:34,890
Huh.

24
00:02:35,270 --> 00:02:36,150
Mr. Zhuo,

25
00:02:36,310 --> 00:02:37,670
after you became a demon,

26
00:02:37,670 --> 00:02:40,300
your voice turned more sonorous when cursing.

27
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:44,640
But you'd better be careful.

28
00:02:44,870 --> 00:02:45,390
It seems

29
00:02:45,410 --> 00:02:47,050
your ice marks

30
00:02:47,150 --> 00:02:48,210
are about to crack.

31
00:02:52,110 --> 00:02:53,550
If Jiu were here

32
00:02:53,950 --> 00:02:55,570
and saw the powerful great demon

33
00:02:55,570 --> 00:02:57,090
Mr. Zhuo has become,

34
00:02:57,790 --> 00:02:59,630
he'd scream with delight.

35
00:03:00,990 --> 00:03:02,920
Jiu is most afraid of great demons.

36
00:03:03,550 --> 00:03:04,670
I think he'd scream

37
00:03:04,670 --> 00:03:05,400
with terror.

38
00:03:10,070 --> 00:03:11,730
What are we having for dinner?

39
00:03:11,870 --> 00:03:13,000
Sweet and sour ribs?

40
00:03:14,510 --> 00:03:15,440
What do you mean?

41
00:03:15,750 --> 00:03:16,980
Then why didn't you

42
00:03:17,470 --> 00:03:19,310
buy sugar and ribs?

43
00:03:22,950 --> 00:03:23,590
What?

44
00:03:27,670 --> 00:03:29,520
The ingredients are hard to get in the Wilderness.

45
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:32,120
I'll make it when we return to the mortal world.

46
00:03:33,270 --> 00:03:34,120
She's coming.

47
00:03:52,090 --> 00:03:53,329
Baize Goddess.

48
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:56,620
Are you Zhu Yan?

49
00:03:57,510 --> 00:03:58,430
See?

50
00:03:58,829 --> 00:03:59,790
I told you

51
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:02,140
everyone in the Wilderness knows me.

52
00:04:02,740 --> 00:04:04,670
The notorious Zhu Yan.

53
00:04:07,220 --> 00:04:09,750
Next time, please finish your words in one go.

54
00:04:11,670 --> 00:04:13,910
Baize Goddess, why did you free me

55
00:04:14,170 --> 00:04:16,089
and summon me here?

56
00:04:16,970 --> 00:04:18,100
I want

57
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:21,399
to ask you for a dragon scale.

58
00:04:23,830 --> 00:04:25,040
Interesting.

59
00:04:25,870 --> 00:04:28,940
Why are there so many people who want my dragon scale today?

60
00:04:28,940 --> 00:04:31,740
Someone else asked you for your dragon scale, too?

61
00:04:31,940 --> 00:04:33,270
If you don't want to die,

62
00:04:33,310 --> 00:04:34,970
give me your dragon scale.

63
00:04:38,030 --> 00:04:39,430
A dragon has a reverse scale,

64
00:04:39,430 --> 00:04:40,990
which you can't touch.

65
00:04:41,350 --> 00:04:43,470
If you touch it, the dragon will get angry.

66
00:04:43,470 --> 00:04:45,330
Neither can you snatch the scale.

67
00:04:45,630 --> 00:04:48,110
If you do, its spiritual energy will disappear.

68
00:04:48,110 --> 00:04:50,310
Only if the dragon gives you the scale willingly

69
00:04:50,310 --> 00:04:52,200
can it resurrect everything.

70
00:04:53,750 --> 00:04:55,860
You don't even know that?

71
00:05:02,670 --> 00:05:03,480
Oh.

72
00:05:05,430 --> 00:05:06,690
There's someone else.

73
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:13,800
Princess Longyu.

74
00:05:14,190 --> 00:05:15,380
Your old friend

75
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:17,240
asked me to send you a letter.

76
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:33,460
[Meng Xuan]

77
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:35,150
Meng Xuan.

78
00:05:37,470 --> 00:05:41,970
[To Long Yu] [Meng Xuan]

79
00:05:46,210 --> 00:05:49,640
[Meng Xuan]

80
00:05:50,230 --> 00:05:52,430
There's nothing to expect of this love.

81
00:05:52,590 --> 00:05:54,590
Although I regret it, it's too late.

82
00:05:55,620 --> 00:05:56,720
Meng Xuan.

83
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:02,740
Where did you get this?

84
00:06:03,140 --> 00:06:04,340
You want to know?

85
00:06:05,990 --> 00:06:08,590
Give me Zhu Yan's inner core, and I'll tell you.

86
00:06:22,110 --> 00:06:23,910
Why do you want the dragon scale?

87
00:06:24,710 --> 00:06:25,960
I'm poisoned.

88
00:06:27,310 --> 00:06:28,450
I want to detoxify.

89
00:06:29,430 --> 00:06:30,470
Poisoned?

90
00:06:32,030 --> 00:06:34,880
The goddess is really good at making up stories.

91
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:38,370
Besides books about demons, there must also be many novels

92
00:06:38,370 --> 00:06:40,120
in the Archives.

93
00:06:40,710 --> 00:06:42,040
She must have read a lot.

94
00:06:42,490 --> 00:06:43,390
Novels?

95
00:06:44,740 --> 00:06:45,380
When I was young,

96
00:06:45,380 --> 00:06:47,390
my grandfather didn't allow me to read novels,

97
00:06:47,390 --> 00:06:49,280
calling them vulgar.

98
00:06:50,170 --> 00:06:51,900
I don't quite understand that.

99
00:06:52,220 --> 00:06:53,270
The novels Wen Xiao read

100
00:06:53,270 --> 00:06:54,830
are not the same

101
00:06:55,409 --> 00:06:57,730
as the novels your grandfather mentioned.

102
00:06:57,730 --> 00:06:59,090
I want the dragon scale

103
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:00,470
just to live

104
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,360
so that I can stay with him

105
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:04,600
forever.

106
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:09,240
Am I right?

107
00:07:11,180 --> 00:07:12,210
Of course.

108
00:07:13,450 --> 00:07:15,020
They say

109
00:07:15,310 --> 00:07:17,240
people who love each other don't always

110
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:19,250
get together and live happily ever after.

111
00:07:19,250 --> 00:07:20,480
They don't know

112
00:07:20,910 --> 00:07:22,810
there are faithful lovers

113
00:07:22,990 --> 00:07:25,920
who are willing to give up everything for each other.

114
00:07:30,380 --> 00:07:31,420
That's us.

115
00:07:32,760 --> 00:07:34,340
Faithful lovers?

116
00:07:35,150 --> 00:07:37,430
When a human and a demon fall in love with each other,

117
00:07:37,430 --> 00:07:39,390
it's destined to be a tragedy.

118
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:42,760
You owe me the dragon scale.

119
00:07:44,070 --> 00:07:45,470
You owe me a life.

120
00:07:46,850 --> 00:07:47,980
Have you forgotten?

121
00:07:49,100 --> 00:07:50,120
No, I haven't.

122
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:53,920
I'm willing to hold your hands

123
00:07:54,510 --> 00:07:57,340
and spend the rest of my life with you.

124
00:07:58,030 --> 00:07:59,200
Meng Xuan.

125
00:08:06,790 --> 00:08:09,250
These are the Feng Pearl and the Huang Pearl,

126
00:08:09,630 --> 00:08:11,690
secret treasures of the Longyu Clan.

127
00:08:12,550 --> 00:08:13,620
Now,

128
00:08:13,950 --> 00:08:16,220
I'm giving the Feng Pearl to you.

129
00:08:17,910 --> 00:08:20,910
Feng and Huang are two birds that are always together.

130
00:08:21,230 --> 00:08:22,920
If you don't deceive me,

131
00:08:23,230 --> 00:08:25,230
I'll be with you in life and in death.

132
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:33,429
Darling.

133
00:08:34,309 --> 00:08:35,700
Don't bother.

134
00:08:37,030 --> 00:08:38,710
I was bitten by the Black Bee.

135
00:08:40,110 --> 00:08:41,510
Herbs in the mortal world

136
00:08:42,070 --> 00:08:43,470
can't cure me.

137
00:08:46,270 --> 00:08:47,270
You will be cured.

138
00:08:49,590 --> 00:08:51,550
I asked Princess Longyu for help.

139
00:08:52,730 --> 00:08:55,380
The reverse scale on the back of her neck can cure all diseases

140
00:08:55,380 --> 00:08:57,170
and bring the dead back to life.

141
00:09:01,390 --> 00:09:02,550
You and the baby

142
00:09:03,590 --> 00:09:04,920
will be fine.

143
00:09:06,250 --> 00:09:07,640
Drink the medicine.

144
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:18,990
I asked Princess Longyu for help.

145
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:22,430
The reverse scale on the back of her neck can cure all diseases

146
00:09:22,430 --> 00:09:24,260
and bring the dead back to life.

147
00:09:24,850 --> 00:09:26,660
But he didn't know

148
00:09:26,910 --> 00:09:28,000
every creature in the river

149
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,710
could talk to me.

150
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:32,620
He lied to me.

151
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,740
He just wanted to save his wife and child.

152
00:09:36,750 --> 00:09:37,830
I hated him.

153
00:09:40,910 --> 00:09:44,300
I was jealous of the woman he had been protecting.

154
00:09:45,690 --> 00:09:47,680
So, I wanted to kill them.

155
00:09:52,070 --> 00:09:53,110
Senior.

156
00:09:57,490 --> 00:09:58,620
Meng Xuan.

157
00:09:58,790 --> 00:09:59,190
Yes.

158
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:02,310
Well...

159
00:10:04,550 --> 00:10:06,150
Take the medicine

160
00:10:06,540 --> 00:10:08,120
to my home and give it to my wife.

161
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:08,890
Okay.

162
00:10:09,030 --> 00:10:10,710
I have to go out of town now.

163
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:11,530
Okay.

164
00:10:11,560 --> 00:10:12,290
Don't worry.

165
00:10:12,300 --> 00:10:13,430
I'll go now.

166
00:10:13,460 --> 00:10:14,110
Okay.

167
00:10:14,390 --> 00:10:16,880
But I couldn't bear to kill Meng Xuan.

168
00:10:18,470 --> 00:10:21,150
So, I asked him to meet me outside of town

169
00:10:22,550 --> 00:10:24,330
so he wouldn't be home.

170
00:10:25,140 --> 00:10:27,830
Unexpectedly, he didn't come.

171
00:10:28,260 --> 00:10:29,570
Wen He.

172
00:10:29,780 --> 00:10:30,570
Meng.

173
00:10:30,820 --> 00:10:31,660
Where is Wen Xiao?

174
00:10:31,660 --> 00:10:32,830
I haven't seen her for a long time.

175
00:10:32,830 --> 00:10:34,290
She's grown taller, right?

176
00:10:34,290 --> 00:10:36,400
I heard my senior's wife has lost her appetite recently.

177
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:38,000
I brought her some plums.

178
00:10:38,350 --> 00:10:39,680
Something smells good.

179
00:10:40,460 --> 00:10:41,390
What is it?

180
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:43,190
Mrs...

181
00:10:44,870 --> 00:10:45,870
Wen,

182
00:10:45,900 --> 00:10:47,030
it has been...

183
00:10:47,150 --> 00:10:48,390
Wen! Wen!

184
00:10:50,510 --> 00:10:51,360
Guards.

185
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:52,170
Guards!

186
00:11:01,970 --> 00:11:03,630
I secretly put some Bone-Melting Incense,

187
00:11:03,630 --> 00:11:06,150
a unique poison of our clan,

188
00:11:06,630 --> 00:11:08,210
in Meng Xuan's house.

189
00:11:08,730 --> 00:11:10,160
Bone-Melting Incense?

190
00:11:11,110 --> 00:11:12,550
It's a diffusive poison

191
00:11:12,550 --> 00:11:14,210
made from red mermaid pearls.

192
00:11:14,790 --> 00:11:17,450
Anyone who smells it rots and dies immediately.

193
00:11:18,850 --> 00:11:22,450
It's strictly forbidden to take this poison to the mortal world.

194
00:11:23,350 --> 00:11:26,150
I only wanted to kill his wife and child.

195
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:30,590
I didn't expect Meng Xuan would stand me up

196
00:11:32,470 --> 00:11:34,330
and go home early.

197
00:11:34,870 --> 00:11:37,740
Maybe God thought he was hateful, too.

198
00:11:38,350 --> 00:11:40,200
He deserved it.

199
00:11:41,540 --> 00:11:42,690
Is there a saying

200
00:11:42,780 --> 00:11:44,440
in the mortal world that goes,

201
00:11:44,540 --> 00:11:45,630
"An innocent person's only crime

202
00:11:45,630 --> 00:11:47,360
is to own something valuable"?

203
00:11:48,710 --> 00:11:49,940
Princess Longyu

204
00:11:50,670 --> 00:11:52,630
may never be able to tell

205
00:11:53,510 --> 00:11:54,670
if her admirers

206
00:11:55,510 --> 00:11:57,240
come for her

207
00:11:58,260 --> 00:12:00,140
or for her dragon scale.

208
00:12:02,300 --> 00:12:03,660
People with a treasure

209
00:12:04,530 --> 00:12:06,510
are always surrounded by bad wolves

210
00:12:06,510 --> 00:12:07,970
and cunning foxes.

211
00:12:09,090 --> 00:12:10,310
In most cases,

212
00:12:10,330 --> 00:12:12,190
in order to protect the treasure,

213
00:12:12,610 --> 00:12:15,050
they become a bloodthirsty beast, too.

214
00:12:19,250 --> 00:12:20,710
It's a choice.

215
00:12:22,190 --> 00:12:23,520
She could choose not to.

216
00:12:26,110 --> 00:12:27,160
No matter what,

217
00:12:28,430 --> 00:12:29,740
sharp teeth and claws

218
00:12:30,410 --> 00:12:32,810
can't be used to hurt the innocent and weak.

219
00:12:35,710 --> 00:12:37,140
Meng Xuan was hateful.

220
00:12:38,330 --> 00:12:39,860
But you deserve death, too.

221
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:44,200
Meng Xuan's wife was pregnant.

222
00:12:44,230 --> 00:12:45,760
How could you do that?

223
00:12:47,260 --> 00:12:50,010
You also killed my father.

224
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:39,540
I was guided here by the short flute.

225
00:13:40,870 --> 00:13:42,760
I'm glad I found you.

226
00:13:48,350 --> 00:13:49,310
I'll pay you back

227
00:13:49,940 --> 00:13:51,360
what I owe you.

228
00:13:53,270 --> 00:13:54,950
But I have a request.

229
00:13:55,890 --> 00:13:56,990
What is it?

230
00:13:57,510 --> 00:13:58,750
If you want my scale,

231
00:14:00,730 --> 00:14:02,710
give me his inner core.

232
00:14:48,850 --> 00:14:49,640
Wen Xiao.

233
00:14:53,400 --> 00:14:54,570
I thought

234
00:14:55,030 --> 00:14:57,400
I could use Princess Longyu's guilt for me

235
00:14:58,150 --> 00:15:00,280
to make her hand over her dragon scale.

236
00:15:00,820 --> 00:15:01,350
Wen Xiao.

237
00:15:01,350 --> 00:15:02,760
But I didn't expect that...

238
00:15:02,760 --> 00:15:04,020
Don't blame yourself.

239
00:15:04,840 --> 00:15:07,440
Not everyone is as kind as you.

240
00:15:08,580 --> 00:15:10,240
Don't let others' wickedness

241
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:11,910
change your kindness.

242
00:15:15,130 --> 00:15:15,930
Hey.

243
00:15:16,630 --> 00:15:17,930
Don't you think

244
00:15:17,950 --> 00:15:19,770
you look too grim?

245
00:15:20,100 --> 00:15:23,120
It may make others think the Wilderness is going to collapse again.

246
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:25,100
The Wilderness is not going to collapse.

247
00:15:25,100 --> 00:15:26,260
You are.

248
00:15:26,290 --> 00:15:28,350
I can't believe you're still joking.

249
00:15:30,470 --> 00:15:32,020
Handing over Zhao Yuanzhou's inner core is not an option.

250
00:15:32,020 --> 00:15:33,350
Let's find another way.

251
00:15:52,950 --> 00:15:53,470
Zhao Yuanzhou.

252
00:15:53,470 --> 00:15:54,470
Why is it not an option?

253
00:15:54,470 --> 00:15:55,890
If you hand over my inner core,

254
00:15:55,890 --> 00:15:57,420
you can get the dragon scale

255
00:15:57,460 --> 00:15:59,320
to repair your Cloud Light Sword.

256
00:16:04,300 --> 00:16:05,470
Zhao Yuanzhou.

257
00:16:05,830 --> 00:16:07,130
What you said

258
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:08,960
is an insult to Zhuo.

259
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:10,630
Zhao Yuanzhou,

260
00:16:11,020 --> 00:16:12,210
keep

261
00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:14,200
your inner core.

262
00:16:15,260 --> 00:16:16,570
I won't exchange it

263
00:16:16,590 --> 00:16:18,170
for anything,

264
00:16:19,060 --> 00:16:20,790
not even the Cloud Light Sword.

265
00:16:34,760 --> 00:16:36,310
It's useless to look at them.

266
00:16:36,310 --> 00:16:37,560
The sword is mine.

267
00:16:37,720 --> 00:16:38,750
I have the final say.

268
00:16:38,750 --> 00:16:40,210
But the inner core is mine.

269
00:16:40,770 --> 00:16:42,110
I have the final say.

270
00:16:42,930 --> 00:16:43,890
Zhao Yuanzhou,

271
00:16:43,960 --> 00:16:44,870
don't push me.

272
00:16:45,070 --> 00:16:46,230
I'm not.

273
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:49,230
I just don't want you

274
00:16:49,230 --> 00:16:51,150
to face this hard choice.

275
00:16:52,230 --> 00:16:53,960
So, I'm going to choose for you.

276
00:16:55,310 --> 00:16:56,770
And it seems

277
00:16:57,620 --> 00:16:59,000
Pei Sijing and Ying Lei

278
00:16:59,470 --> 00:17:01,070
agree with me.

279
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:06,589
I know you want to save Jiu,

280
00:17:06,910 --> 00:17:08,970
but Zhao Yuanzhou is also our friend.

281
00:17:09,470 --> 00:17:10,140
Can you say

282
00:17:11,310 --> 00:17:12,960
one friend is more important than another?

283
00:17:12,960 --> 00:17:13,849
Why not?

284
00:17:14,109 --> 00:17:15,040
You're a coward,

285
00:17:15,310 --> 00:17:16,750
and you want to treat them fairly,

286
00:17:16,750 --> 00:17:18,640
but that doesn't mean everyone's like you.

287
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:20,150
If you don't dare to choose,

288
00:17:20,150 --> 00:17:20,950
I dare!

289
00:17:21,470 --> 00:17:22,730
Jiu is more important!

290
00:17:26,619 --> 00:17:28,440
If everyone were fine today,

291
00:17:28,460 --> 00:17:30,260
I wouldn't force Zhao Yuanzhou.

292
00:17:30,620 --> 00:17:31,310
If

293
00:17:31,310 --> 00:17:32,870
Princess Longyu wanted my inner core,

294
00:17:32,870 --> 00:17:34,600
I'd give it to her immediately.

295
00:17:35,510 --> 00:17:36,750
But today,

296
00:17:36,920 --> 00:17:39,120
if either Jiu or Zhao Yuanzhou must die,

297
00:17:39,220 --> 00:17:40,770
I'll choose Zhao Yuanzhou

298
00:17:41,150 --> 00:17:42,350
without hesitation.

299
00:17:46,670 --> 00:17:47,680
Ying Lei.

300
00:17:48,680 --> 00:17:49,720
Every one of you

301
00:17:49,750 --> 00:17:50,990
is saying

302
00:17:51,160 --> 00:17:52,330
pretty words.

303
00:17:52,770 --> 00:17:54,230
Don't you want

304
00:17:54,250 --> 00:17:55,600
to be favored

305
00:17:55,860 --> 00:17:57,230
and be chosen firmly?

306
00:17:57,230 --> 00:17:59,680
Do you think Zhao Yuanzhou doesn't want to be favored

307
00:17:59,680 --> 00:18:01,540
and be chosen firmly?

308
00:18:02,920 --> 00:18:04,510
He

309
00:18:05,460 --> 00:18:07,870
has never been chosen firmly.

310
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:11,930
Oh, that's not true.

311
00:18:12,690 --> 00:18:13,570
He has.

312
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:17,550
Malicious energy chose him,

313
00:18:18,380 --> 00:18:20,370
and then everyone gave up on him.

314
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:27,260
Mr. Zhuo,

315
00:18:28,330 --> 00:18:30,200
don't you want to save Jiu?

316
00:18:30,210 --> 00:18:32,400
He's being kept in that dark place.

317
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:35,860
He must be scared.

318
00:18:38,220 --> 00:18:39,870
Every time he's most scared,

319
00:18:42,040 --> 00:18:43,320
you are the one

320
00:18:44,310 --> 00:18:45,470
he wants to turn to!

321
00:18:51,350 --> 00:18:52,190
Mr. Zhuo,

322
00:18:54,250 --> 00:18:55,420
Jiu needs you.

323
00:19:00,440 --> 00:19:01,680
No matter what,

324
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:05,490
I'm on Zhuo's side.

325
00:19:07,710 --> 00:19:08,830
We don't agree

326
00:19:08,850 --> 00:19:11,710
to sacrifice Zhao Yuanzhou to get the dragon scale.

327
00:19:12,210 --> 00:19:13,350
It's not "we."

328
00:19:14,230 --> 00:19:15,890
It's only you and Zhuo Yichen.

329
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:28,500
I thought

330
00:19:32,360 --> 00:19:34,200
we were like-minded.

331
00:19:36,500 --> 00:19:38,190
I was wrong.

332
00:19:40,040 --> 00:19:41,200
Today,

333
00:19:43,560 --> 00:19:46,420
anyone who wants to take Zhao Yuanzhou's inner core

334
00:19:48,750 --> 00:19:50,930
has to defeat me first.

335
00:19:59,070 --> 00:20:00,150
Don't bother.

336
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:02,180
Don't use violence.

337
00:20:02,760 --> 00:20:04,220
I'll take out my inner core

338
00:20:06,130 --> 00:20:07,610
myself.

339
00:20:15,910 --> 00:20:16,750
Great Demon,

340
00:20:16,770 --> 00:20:17,570
no!

341
00:20:18,440 --> 00:20:19,600
Zhao Yuanzhou!

342
00:21:14,690 --> 00:21:16,820
I brought Zhao Yuanzhou's inner core.

343
00:21:17,950 --> 00:21:19,080
Where is the letter?

344
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:22,980
[To Long Yu]

345
00:21:26,750 --> 00:21:31,540
[To Long Yu]

346
00:21:56,870 --> 00:21:58,210
This letter doesn't mean anything

I'm afraid.

523
00:33:41,430 --> 00:33:42,840
I'm afraid that one day,

524
00:33:45,550 --> 00:33:47,310
we will be blown apart

525
00:33:47,910 --> 00:33:49,120
and crushed.

526
00:33:53,750 --> 00:33:54,680
Don't be afraid.

527
00:33:55,710 --> 00:33:56,970
How can I not be afraid?

528

I'm afraid of separation.

I'm afraid when I wake up from this dream,

00:34:06,390 --> 00:34:09,650
there will only be a vast expanse of whiteness in the world.

531
00:34:15,350 --> 00:34:17,080
No matter how long the dream is,

532
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:19,350
we will wake up.

533
00:34:20,230 --> 00:34:21,630
We'll go back to reality,

534
00:34:22,469 --> 00:34:24,600
but we'll remember the dream forever.

535
00:34:27,179 --> 00:34:28,310
So,

536
00:34:30,030 --> 00:34:30,989
don't be afraid.

537
00:34:35,310 --> 00:34:36,190
Right.

538
00:34:38,989 --> 00:34:43,120
You're the great demon dominating the two realms. With you protecting me,

539
00:34:45,190 --> 00:34:46,850
I have nothing to be afraid of.

540
00:34:51,949 --> 00:34:53,659
No wonder

541
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:56,199
you forced me to sign the contract of lifelong protection.

542
00:34:56,199 --> 00:34:56,949
Yeah.

543
00:34:59,260 --> 00:35:01,350
I need a strong fighter.

544
00:35:08,590 --> 00:35:09,630
You

545
00:35:10,360 --> 00:35:12,550
are Baize Goddess now.

546
00:35:13,380 --> 00:35:15,980
Many great and little demons are watching you.

547
00:35:16,070 --> 00:35:17,870
You must live.

548
00:35:18,180 --> 00:35:19,940
They all rely

549
00:35:19,970 --> 00:35:22,170
on you to protect them.

550
00:35:25,030 --> 00:35:27,510
Why is it that every time I finish playing the wooden flute,

551
00:35:27,510 --> 00:35:28,420
my heart aches

552
00:35:28,550 --> 00:35:30,450
as if it's burning.

553
00:35:36,030 --> 00:35:36,580
Okay.

554
00:35:43,400 --> 00:35:45,260
Then let's live together.

555
00:35:57,470 --> 00:35:58,530
What are you doing?

556
00:36:01,510 --> 00:36:03,400
Since we agreed to live,

557
00:36:04,960 --> 00:36:06,040
let's seal it.

558
00:36:32,010 --> 00:36:33,460
I'll go find more livers.

559
00:36:33,600 --> 00:36:34,630
No need.

560
00:36:36,630 --> 00:36:39,720
Human livers can only slow down the spread of the poison.

561
00:36:39,720 --> 00:36:41,580
I'm already seriously poisoned.

562
00:36:43,560 --> 00:36:44,730
Don't bother.

563
00:36:56,550 --> 00:36:57,430
Don't worry.

564
00:36:59,310 --> 00:37:01,640
I will get the dragon scale to cure you.

565
00:37:35,860 --> 00:37:36,900
He's still angry.

566
00:37:42,290 --> 00:37:43,060
Zhuo,

stop being angry.

568
00:37:44,700 --> 00:37:47,500
Next time, I'll act with you to fool Zhao Yuanzhou.

569
00:37:48,290 --> 00:37:49,910
There's no next time.

570
00:37:50,790 --> 00:37:52,920
I'm not good at pretending to quarrel,

571
00:37:53,690 --> 00:37:55,000

Why is it not an option?

575
00:38:07,410 --> 00:38:08,050
Oh.

576
00:38:09,790 --> 00:38:11,050
Take the dragon scale.

577
00:38:11,060 --> 00:38:13,860
You can use it to repair your Cloud Light Sword now.

578

There's no rush.

579
00:38:18,410 --> 00:38:20,070
This is the only dragon scale.

580
00:38:20,230 --> 00:38:22,830
Besides, we don't know how to repair the sword.

581
00:38:24,090 --> 00:38:26,230
I think we'd better wait for Lord Bai Yan

583

Right.

584

It's a matter of success and failure.

585

We can't be hasty.

586

00:44:45,320 --> 00:44:47,000
has completely forgotten

689
00:44:48,480 --> 00:44:50,710
he once taught me

690
00:44:50,970 --> 00:44:52,190
all

691
00:44:53,900 --> 00:44:56,380
his tricks.

692
00:44:59,820 --> 00:45:00,900
My lord.

693
00:45:05,030 --> 00:45:06,630
You are seriously poisoned.

694
00:45:07,880 --> 00:45:10,080
Don't use your power casually anymore.

695
00:45:22,530 --> 00:45:23,610
Where is the dragon scale?
