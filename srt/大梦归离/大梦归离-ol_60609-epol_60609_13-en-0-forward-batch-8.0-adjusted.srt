[Episode 13]

3
00:01:55,750 --> 00:01:58,210
I was afraid of causing the plague to spread,

4
00:01:58,270 --> 00:02:00,710
so I went to live in the cave alone.

5
00:02:03,070 --> 00:02:05,530
There's no concept of time in the mountains.

6
00:02:06,310 --> 00:02:09,640
When the cold weather ends, I don't even know what year it is.

7
00:02:09,670 --> 00:02:10,750
Life is short,

8
00:02:13,870 --> 00:02:15,200
but loneliness is long.

9
00:02:16,830 --> 00:02:17,949
Finally, one day,

10
00:02:18,750 --> 00:02:20,240
I couldn't help it

11
00:02:21,350 --> 00:02:23,350
and went to a town where humans live.

12
00:02:25,079 --> 00:02:26,680
That's where I met Qing Geng.

13
00:02:31,350 --> 00:02:33,710
Qing Geng was the first friend I made.

14
00:02:34,670 --> 00:02:35,630
I was very happy.

15
00:02:36,430 --> 00:02:38,890
Since I went to the town to see Qing Geng a lot,

16
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:40,910
the plague finally spread.

17
00:02:43,310 --> 00:02:44,570
It was all because of me

18
00:02:45,630 --> 00:02:47,190
that the mortal world I love

19
00:02:48,670 --> 00:02:50,310
turned into a hell.

20
00:02:59,750 --> 00:03:02,750
Since Qing Geng can suppress the source of the plague,

21
00:03:03,350 --> 00:03:05,950
the Baize Goddess could only seal us together.

22
00:03:12,420 --> 00:03:14,630
Am I being too delusional?

23
00:03:15,750 --> 00:03:17,680
I actually want to cure the plague.

24
00:03:19,750 --> 00:03:21,510
Don't be too hard on yourself.

25
00:03:23,150 --> 00:03:24,300
It's all because of you!

26
00:03:24,300 --> 00:03:25,900
I don't want to see you again!

27
00:03:31,070 --> 00:03:31,870
Because of me,

28
00:03:34,030 --> 00:03:35,230
she's trapped

29
00:03:35,230 --> 00:03:38,030
in this dark villa for eternity.

[God Bless Lingxi]

31
00:03:41,190 --> 00:03:42,270
My existence

32
00:03:43,550 --> 00:03:45,610
is Qing Geng's greatest misfortune.

33
00:03:50,750 --> 00:03:51,950
This is my inner core.

34
00:03:53,190 --> 00:03:53,980
Wait.

35
00:03:55,390 --> 00:03:56,630
Could the method

36
00:03:58,829 --> 00:04:00,430
you were talking about be...

37
00:04:12,190 --> 00:04:13,390
As long as I die,

38
00:04:15,430 --> 00:04:17,150
the plague will be gone.

39
00:04:26,790 --> 00:04:27,589
Please.

40
00:04:31,230 --> 00:04:32,510
Don't kill her.

41
00:04:34,110 --> 00:04:35,870
If Qing Geng were gone,

42
00:04:38,030 --> 00:04:39,350
I'd have no friends

43
00:04:40,870 --> 00:04:42,710
in this world anymore.

44
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:56,550
I'm a beast of calamity.

45
00:04:59,230 --> 00:05:01,630
I don't deserve to live in the mortal world.

46
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:03,270
But I really

47
00:05:04,740 --> 00:05:07,260
like the bright lights,

48

and the prosperity here.

50
00:05:22,180 --> 00:05:23,980
It's just as a beast of calamity,

51
00:05:27,670 --> 00:05:28,830
I have no choice.

52
00:06:30,790 --> 00:06:31,590
Where is Fei?

53
00:06:35,630 --> 00:06:36,430
He's dead.

54
00:06:37,070 --> 00:06:39,730
He killed himself by destroying his inner core.

55
00:07:08,070 --> 00:07:08,870
Good.

56
00:07:10,350 --> 00:07:12,280
It's actually good that he's dead.

57
00:07:13,950 --> 00:07:15,070
Since he died,

58
00:07:18,390 --> 00:07:19,830
I can be free.

59
00:07:25,750 --> 00:07:26,880
It's not good at all.

00:07:27,110 --> 00:07:28,710
Why else would you be crying?

61
00:07:52,230 --> 00:07:53,909
Do you know why you cry?

62
00:07:56,190 --> 00:07:58,590
Because Li Lun hid something in you.

63
00:08:09,630 --> 00:08:10,720
I noticed just now that

64
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:13,250
there's Li Lun's demonic energy in your body.

65
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:16,470
That's why I asked Mr. Zhuo

66
00:08:17,710 --> 00:08:19,150
to use his blood of Bingyi

67
00:08:20,030 --> 00:08:22,690
to cleanse the evil demonic energy in your body.

68
00:08:23,030 --> 00:08:24,270
Mr. Zhuo

69
00:08:24,550 --> 00:08:26,070
is a man of righteousness.

70
00:08:27,190 --> 00:08:28,260
His blood contains more power

71
00:08:28,260 --> 00:08:30,230
to cleanse the evil energy.

72
00:09:03,070 --> 00:09:04,600
Look at this demonic power.

with this sick body.

342
00:25:06,510 --> 00:25:07,630
God forbid!

343
00:25:07,630 --> 00:25:09,390
I won't accept that we'll just all die together.

344
00:25:09,390 --> 00:25:10,830
I'll go work on the antidote.

345
00:25:10,830 --> 00:25:11,890
There must be a way.

346
00:25:13,030 --> 00:25:13,830
Jiu!

347
00:25:43,270 --> 00:25:44,430
If you feel sick,

348
00:25:45,150 --> 00:25:46,680
you can lean on my shoulder.

349
00:25:49,150 --> 00:25:50,410
Are you that reliable?

350
00:25:59,710 --> 00:26:01,910
You're indeed more reliable, Mr. Zhuo.

351
00:26:02,550 --> 00:26:03,230
Your shoulders

352
00:26:03,230 --> 00:26:04,270
carry it all.

353
00:26:05,230 --> 00:26:06,030
Thank you.

354
00:26:06,590 --> 00:26:07,790
Are you praising me?

355
00:26:11,230 --> 00:26:12,760
I'm just telling the truth.

356
00:26:13,310 --> 00:26:14,950
If you hadn't been so smart,

357
00:26:16,160 --> 00:26:17,000
pretended to faint,

358
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:18,680
and gone deep into the tiger's den, Mr. Zhuo,

359
00:26:18,680 --> 00:26:19,430
we couldn't have

360
00:26:19,430 --> 00:26:21,360
found the real culprit so quickly.

361
00:26:24,030 --> 00:26:25,270
The real culprit

362
00:26:26,950 --> 00:26:28,150
is Li Lun.

363
00:26:30,590 --> 00:26:31,990
To be precise, it's Li Lun

364
00:26:32,390 --> 00:26:33,510
and Chongwu Camp.

365
00:26:35,390 --> 00:26:37,390
I didn't expect them to join forces.

366
00:26:40,350 --> 00:26:41,620
Li Lun planted

367
00:26:42,150 --> 00:26:43,810
the dark evil aura in Qing Geng

368
00:26:44,190 --> 00:26:45,750
to make her angry

369
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:47,460
and spread the plague.

370
00:26:48,470 --> 00:26:49,930
And then, he kidnapped Jiu

371
00:26:50,910 --> 00:26:52,510
to lure Mr. Zhuo away.

372
00:26:54,470 --> 00:26:55,730
So that mysterious man

373
00:26:55,870 --> 00:26:57,150
kidnapped me here

374
00:26:58,190 --> 00:27:00,250
to use my Cloud Light Sword to kill you

375
00:27:00,510 --> 00:27:01,910
and take your inner core.

376
00:27:02,630 --> 00:27:04,110
Li Lun is a demon himself.

377
00:27:05,430 --> 00:27:07,230
Why does he want your inner core?

378
00:27:12,470 --> 00:27:14,390
When Qing Geng imprisoned me,

379
00:27:15,550 --> 00:27:17,480
she used Qin Yuan's poison needle.

380
00:27:18,670 --> 00:27:20,130
Qin Yuan's poison needle?

381
00:27:21,710 --> 00:27:22,670
Qin Yuan

382
00:27:24,310 --> 00:27:25,630
is shaped like a bee.

383
00:27:26,070 --> 00:27:27,590
It's as big as a mandarin duck.

384
00:27:27,590 --> 00:27:30,150
When birds and beasts are stung by it, they'll die.

385
00:27:30,150 --> 00:27:32,610
When plants are stung by it, they'll wither.

386
00:27:33,310 --> 00:27:34,870
Chongwu Camp figured out

387
00:27:35,790 --> 00:27:38,030
how to make Qin Yuan's poison needle years ago.

388
00:27:38,030 --> 00:27:39,290
The medicine is ready.

389
00:27:41,880 --> 00:27:43,080
But it's very potent.

390
00:27:43,150 --> 00:27:44,150
I'm not sure.

391
00:27:44,990 --> 00:27:47,520
What if it makes your condition even worse...

392
00:27:56,230 --> 00:27:57,260
Mr. Zhuo.

393
00:27:57,670 --> 00:27:58,790
Let me try it.

394
00:27:59,230 --> 00:28:00,710
I won't die anyway.

395
00:28:01,270 --> 00:28:03,670
There's no room for my condition to worsen.

396
00:28:13,580 --> 00:28:14,550
How does it feel?

397
00:28:16,470 --> 00:28:17,270
Bitter.

398
00:28:20,550 --> 00:28:21,430
I'm asking how you feel,

399
00:28:21,430 --> 00:28:22,510
not how it tastes.

400
00:28:25,750 --> 00:28:26,910
I feel bad.

401
00:28:27,830 --> 00:28:28,590
But I checked

402
00:28:28,590 --> 00:28:31,020
the prescription left on Qing Geng's table.

403
00:28:31,020 --> 00:28:33,590
This is indeed a prescription to cure the plague.

404
00:28:33,590 --> 00:28:34,920
But why doesn't it work?

405
00:28:36,030 --> 00:28:36,950
Qing Geng

406
00:28:36,950 --> 00:28:38,230
once told me

407
00:28:39,350 --> 00:28:41,210
she had studied it for many years,

408
00:28:42,270 --> 00:28:43,390
but it seems

409
00:28:43,830 --> 00:28:45,430
there's still one enhancing ingredient missing

410
00:28:45,430 --> 00:28:47,950
that could combine the power of all herbs.

411
00:28:48,630 --> 00:28:49,960
Enhancing ingredient?

412
00:28:52,230 --> 00:28:54,030
Qing Geng lives on a cypress tree

413
00:28:54,670 --> 00:28:56,670
and feeds on its flowers and fruits.

414
00:28:57,590 --> 00:28:58,520
Avoid plague...

415
00:28:59,950 --> 00:29:01,070
Cypress tree...

416
00:29:02,910 --> 00:29:05,170
I know what the enhancing ingredient is!

417
00:29:11,270 --> 00:29:14,670
It's said that when trees grow over 100 years, they will cultivate spiritual energy.

418
00:29:14,670 --> 00:29:16,030
Qing Geng likes living here,

419
00:29:16,030 --> 00:29:17,830
and she feeds on the flowers and fruits on the tree.

420
00:29:17,830 --> 00:29:20,230
That's why she managed to avoid the plague.

421
00:29:21,150 --> 00:29:22,870
But this tree has withered.

422
00:29:23,030 --> 00:29:24,350
There're no flowers or fruits,

423
00:29:24,350 --> 00:29:25,390
not even leaves.

424
00:29:25,750 --> 00:29:26,750
What should we do?

425
00:29:28,910 --> 00:29:30,310
How about using the bark?

426
00:29:33,710 --> 00:29:34,510
Let's peel it.

427

00:29:40,190 --> 00:29:41,320

Alright, your palm hurts.

This won't do.

432
00:29:48,470 --> 00:29:49,710
The bark is too hard.

433
00:29:49,950 --> 00:29:51,070
I have to borrow

434
00:29:51,070 --> 00:29:53,710
the Cloud Light Sword from Mr. Zhuo and try again.

513
00:35:19,790 --> 00:35:22,510
Most of those who choose to indulge in their dreams

514
00:35:22,510 --> 00:35:24,070
want to escape.

515
00:35:27,870 --> 00:35:28,710
Perhaps

516
00:35:28,980 --> 00:35:30,780
it's not necessarily escaping,

517
00:35:32,230 --> 00:35:33,430
but choosing.

518
00:35:35,830 --> 00:35:38,230
There are thousands of laws in the world...

519
00:35:38,790 --> 00:35:41,920
But none of them can defeat a single word of willingness.

520
00:35:45,670 --> 00:35:47,070
You saw what I wrote?

521
00:35:51,510 --> 00:35:53,100
Mr. Zhuo saw it.

522
00:35:56,710 --> 00:35:57,430
There are

523
00:35:57,660 --> 00:35:59,390
thousands of laws in the world,

524
00:36:00,350 --> 00:36:01,810
but none of them can defeat

525
00:36:02,070 --> 00:36:03,730
a single word of willingness.

526
00:36:04,880 --> 00:36:06,190
The plague is gone.

527
00:36:06,870 --> 00:36:07,430
Now, Qing Geng

528
00:36:07,110 --> 00:36:09,480
[God Bless Lingxi]

529
00:36:07,710 --> 00:36:09,370
can finally leave this place.

530
00:36:09,790 --> 00:36:11,150
She's been trapped here for over 100 years.

531
00:36:11,150 --> 00:36:11,880
If I were her,

532
00:36:11,910 --> 00:36:13,240
I would have gone crazy.

533
00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:15,450
I don't think she'll leave.

534
00:36:15,750 --> 00:36:16,590
I agree.

535
00:36:22,590 --> 00:36:23,310
Mr. Zhuo

536
00:36:23,420 --> 00:36:24,750
and Ms. Pei.

537
00:36:24,910 --> 00:36:26,230
You used to hate demons the most,

538
00:36:26,230 --> 00:36:28,430
but now you've empathized with demons?

539
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:33,260
Is he always like this?

540
00:36:34,950 --> 00:36:35,430
Yes.

541
00:36:36,430 --> 00:36:37,190
What?

542
00:36:40,830 --> 00:36:41,750
Where's Jiu?

543
00:37:16,230 --> 00:37:17,470
Mother!

544
00:37:17,950 --> 00:37:18,550
Jiu.

545
00:37:18,550 --> 00:37:19,710
Come here.

546
00:37:19,870 --> 00:37:20,550
It's okay.

547
00:37:20,550 --> 00:37:21,680
Your mother is okay.

548
00:37:22,430 --> 00:37:23,070
Jiu!

549
00:37:23,310 --> 00:37:23,880
Jiu!

550
00:37:38,270 --> 00:37:39,060
Jiu!

551
00:37:41,510 --> 00:37:41,990
Jiu!

552
00:37:49,390 --> 00:37:49,860
Jiu.

553
00:37:53,630 --> 00:37:54,430
Brother Zhuo.

554
00:37:56,190 --> 00:37:59,390
I called your name several times, but you didn't respond.

555
00:37:59,830 --> 00:38:00,630
What's wrong?

556
00:38:02,310 --> 00:38:03,630
I thought of my mother.

557
00:38:08,150 --> 00:38:10,030
The demon that killed my mother

558
00:38:11,870 --> 00:38:12,990
was also a tree.

559
00:38:28,270 --> 00:38:29,030
So

560
00:38:30,230 --> 00:38:31,830
you're very scared of trees?

561
00:38:35,670 --> 00:38:37,200
Although trees are silent,

562
00:38:38,190 --> 00:38:39,270
they're calm

563
00:38:39,990 --> 00:38:40,790
and tolerant.

564
00:38:41,230 --> 00:38:43,560
They can always absorb your bad emotions.

565
00:38:43,910 --> 00:38:45,000
When I was a kid,

566
00:38:45,430 --> 00:38:48,760
my father and older brother used to go hunt demons together.

567
00:38:49,030 --> 00:38:50,690
They'd leave me alone at home.

568
00:38:53,950 --> 00:38:55,310
I'd talk to that big tree

569
00:38:55,310 --> 00:38:56,710
in the yard.

570
00:38:55,540 --> 00:39:00,660
♫There're no worries in its eyes♫

571
00:38:58,750 --> 00:38:59,630
Sometimes,

572
00:39:00,150 --> 00:39:01,830
I'd think of it as my older brother,

573
00:39:00,860 --> 00:39:06,110
♫It just wants to sleep on a roof♫

574
00:39:02,550 --> 00:39:03,310
and I'd cry to

575
00:39:03,710 --> 00:39:04,590
and smile at it.

576
00:39:06,840 --> 00:39:07,550
In the end,

577
00:39:07,060 --> 00:39:09,820
♫The river flows east and west♫

578
00:39:08,670 --> 00:39:10,390
I'd fall asleep under the tree.

579
00:39:10,170 --> 00:39:13,050
♫The moonlight shines north and south♫

580
00:39:13,190 --> 00:39:14,150
Yichen.

581
00:39:13,570 --> 00:39:18,760
♫Lonely eyes can't make it through the dawn♫

582
00:39:14,150 --> 00:39:15,210
What are you doing?

583
00:39:17,470 --> 00:39:19,420
I saw you look good wearing a headband,

584
00:39:19,420 --> 00:39:22,480
♫Time is quiet♫

585
00:39:19,750 --> 00:39:21,150
so I wanted to wear it too.

586
00:39:21,630 --> 00:39:22,690
Wearing headbands

587
00:39:23,020 --> 00:39:25,970
♫And noisy at the same time♫

588
00:39:23,780 --> 00:39:24,980
is not for good looks.

589
00:39:25,230 --> 00:39:26,430
Then what is it for?

590
00:39:26,390 --> 00:39:30,760
♫How many are the fallen flowers♫

591
00:39:27,870 --> 00:39:30,130
It's for self-restraint and self-love.

592
00:39:30,910 --> 00:39:32,150
It's to remind you to behave yourself.

593
00:39:31,580 --> 00:39:34,530
♫My heart is burning♫

594
00:39:34,780 --> 00:39:37,800
♫The snowflakes are falling♫

595
00:39:38,250 --> 00:39:43,130
♫A heartbeat of cold and heat♫

596
00:39:44,010 --> 00:39:47,060
♫The world is beautiful♫

597
00:39:47,560 --> 00:39:50,080
♫But troubled♫

598
00:39:50,880 --> 00:39:55,430
♫It's going home♫

599
00:39:53,830 --> 00:39:55,960
After hearing what you said, Mr. Zhuo,

600
00:39:57,070 --> 00:39:58,960
I'm not that scared anymore.

601
00:39:57,210 --> 00:40:01,600
♫I'm going home♫

602
00:40:01,990 --> 00:40:03,870
But you're still scared of demons,

603
00:40:03,870 --> 00:40:04,430
right?

604
00:40:05,610 --> 00:40:11,350
♫Has anyone seen a bird with a broken tail?♫

605
00:40:08,550 --> 00:40:10,950
There are so many demons in the Wilderness.

606
00:40:10,950 --> 00:40:12,070
Are you scared?

607
00:40:11,660 --> 00:40:17,500
♫The rain wet its feathers♫

608
00:40:13,590 --> 00:40:15,390
There are demons all over there.

609
00:40:17,670 --> 00:40:19,200
Of course I'm still scared.

610
00:40:19,500 --> 00:40:25,380
♫Its cry has never been heard♫

611
00:40:20,300 --> 00:40:21,350
But

612
00:40:21,350 --> 00:40:22,630
with you

613
00:40:23,190 --> 00:40:25,670
and your powerful Cloud Light Sword here, Mr. Zhuo,

614
00:40:25,670 --> 00:40:31,940
♫Only I know its story♫

615
00:40:25,990 --> 00:40:27,500
I'm not that scared.

616
00:40:29,860 --> 00:40:30,190
Good.

617
00:40:31,030 --> 00:40:32,160
You'll be all right.

618
00:41:01,830 --> 00:41:03,470
Zhao Yuanzhou.

619
00:41:03,990 --> 00:41:06,470
Baize Goddess.

620
00:41:06,950 --> 00:41:11,190
Now that you can freely seal and break the seal,

621
00:41:12,920 --> 00:41:15,920
it seems that you've reached a mutual understanding,

622
00:41:16,870 --> 00:41:18,870
and your minds are in sync.

623
00:41:23,840 --> 00:41:24,950
How nice.

624
00:41:29,510 --> 00:41:31,150
How nice.

625
00:41:39,630 --> 00:41:41,280
How nice.
