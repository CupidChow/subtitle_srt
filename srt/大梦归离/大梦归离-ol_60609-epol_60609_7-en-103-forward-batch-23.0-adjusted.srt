00:02:13,350 --> 00:02:14,750
I have a question for you.

4
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:16,759
Not ashamed to ask,

5
00:02:17,100 --> 00:02:18,700
you've become a good boy now.

6
00:02:21,039 --> 00:02:21,970
Forget about it.

7
00:02:25,210 --> 00:02:26,290
What's your question?

8
00:02:26,290 --> 00:02:29,440
♫The trees and grass of the world sway with the wind♫

9
00:02:29,500 --> 00:02:32,620
♫Beneath the bodhi tree, dust gathers♫

10
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:37,890
♫Who truly decides fate's design?♫

11
00:02:34,850 --> 00:02:36,170
I beg you to ask.

♫Vividly painted in black and white♫

13

Wen Xiao seems

14
00:02:42,540 --> 00:02:44,070
to be doing a lot better.

15
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:46,010
♫It's water under the bridge♫

16
00:02:44,390 --> 00:02:45,270
Is it because...

17
00:02:45,270 --> 00:02:46,570
You know what? Let's just drop it.

18
00:02:46,050 --> 00:02:49,190
♫The moon sheds her light on my heart♫

19
00:02:47,300 --> 00:02:47,900
You...

20
00:02:48,190 --> 00:02:50,470
King Xiang wants us
back to report by noon.

21
00:02:50,470 --> 00:02:51,430
Why are you walking so slowly?

22
00:02:51,320 --> 00:02:54,370
♫The good old days are gone for good like that lantern in my dream♫

23
00:02:51,430 --> 00:02:52,760
Do you wanna get killed?

24
00:02:53,590 --> 00:02:54,620
-Your fault. -Your fault.

25

♫See immortals enter Penglai♫

26
00:03:00,150 --> 00:03:00,890
Jiu!

27
00:03:02,260 --> 00:03:03,660
Brother Zhuo!

28
00:03:06,470 --> 00:03:08,030
I'm so glad to see you back.

29
00:03:08,070 --> 00:03:08,710
I was freaked out!

30
00:03:08,710 --> 00:03:10,350
I was waiting for you
in the Demon Hunting Bureau.

31
00:03:10,350 --> 00:03:11,990
They said if you don't come back
to report by noon,

32
00:03:11,990 --> 00:03:13,630
everyone will pay with their lives.

33
00:03:13,630 --> 00:03:15,310
I was afraid you'd leave me and run away,

34
00:03:15,310 --> 00:03:16,190
and I'd be the only one

35
00:03:16,190 --> 00:03:17,630
to suffer in the Demon Hunting Bureau.

36
00:03:17,630 --> 00:03:19,590
So I came out to welcome you

37
00:03:19,630 --> 00:03:20,620
but accidentally

38
00:03:20,620 --> 00:03:21,860
ended up in this mountain god temple.

39
00:03:21,860 --> 00:03:24,190
There's a demon inside!

40
00:03:31,190 --> 00:03:32,390
Let's go in and check.

41
00:03:33,990 --> 00:03:34,790
Let's go.

42
00:03:58,780 --> 00:03:59,870
Where's the demon?

43
00:04:31,250 --> 00:04:32,230
Jiu.

44
00:04:41,810 --> 00:04:43,190
No demons here.

45
00:04:43,430 --> 00:04:44,510
There is one!

46
00:04:45,550 --> 00:04:47,150
There's definitely one here!

47
00:04:47,150 --> 00:04:48,350
No demons.

48
00:04:49,310 --> 00:04:50,470
There is one.

49
00:04:52,310 --> 00:04:53,880
Such a big one here.

50
00:04:55,130 --> 00:04:56,390
It's not funny.

51
00:05:15,300 --> 00:05:16,590
They've been gone for quite a while.

52
00:05:16,590 --> 00:05:18,450
Could they have run into trouble?

53
00:05:21,860 --> 00:05:23,400
If they don't come back soon,

54
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:25,150
you will be in big trouble.

55
00:05:45,310 --> 00:05:47,810
There's only a quarter of an hour left.

56
00:05:48,110 --> 00:05:49,510
The Demon Hunting Bureau

57
00:05:50,330 --> 00:05:52,660
shall either hand in the closing document

58
00:05:54,620 --> 00:05:55,950
or

59
00:05:56,150 --> 00:05:58,040
kill those five persons.

60
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:11,990
This is my turf;

61
00:06:11,990 --> 00:06:13,630
I am the boss.

62
00:06:13,659 --> 00:06:15,600
If you want to pass...

63
00:06:15,950 --> 00:06:17,270
Little brat,

64
00:06:17,300 --> 00:06:18,630
ditching school

65
00:06:18,630 --> 00:06:19,830
to be a bandit here?

66
00:06:19,830 --> 00:06:20,720
Little?

67
00:06:20,460 --> 00:06:23,510
♫Leaving home, going far away from those mountains♫

68
00:06:21,110 --> 00:06:22,640
Who are you calling little?

69
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:25,940
♫And that stream♫

70
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:31,670
♫The boy wiped away his tears and sang♫

71
00:06:32,470 --> 00:06:35,440
♫He carried his dreams with him♫

72
00:06:35,470 --> 00:06:37,490
♫Jingling all the way♫

73
00:06:37,630 --> 00:06:39,750
♫Wind, rain, and light♫

74
00:06:39,820 --> 00:06:43,010
♫Wandering with me♫

75
00:07:08,659 --> 00:07:09,510
Little girl,

76
00:07:09,630 --> 00:07:11,230
the temple is a solemn place.

77
00:07:11,330 --> 00:07:12,450
Please be quiet.

78
00:07:13,310 --> 00:07:14,840
Who are you calling "girl"?

79
00:07:16,350 --> 00:07:17,310
Not a girl?

80
00:07:17,340 --> 00:07:18,480
He's so short.

81
00:07:21,159 --> 00:07:22,820
He just hit a nerve directly.

82
00:07:22,840 --> 00:07:23,930
Why are you laughing?

83
00:07:23,930 --> 00:07:24,690
I...

84
00:07:25,070 --> 00:07:26,380
You really broke his heart,

85
00:07:26,380 --> 00:07:27,400
boy.

86
00:07:27,470 --> 00:07:28,640
Boy?

87
00:07:29,590 --> 00:07:30,840
If I tell you my age,

88
00:07:30,860 --> 00:07:32,460
you'll certainly freak out.

89
00:07:37,550 --> 00:07:38,550
This man

90
00:07:38,550 --> 00:07:39,920
is 34,000 years old.

91
00:07:42,670 --> 00:07:44,000
It's this demon.

92
00:07:44,780 --> 00:07:46,380
A thousand-year-old demon.

93
00:07:46,910 --> 00:07:48,440
Who are you calling a demon?

94
00:07:48,440 --> 00:07:51,040
Other than demons,
immortals are also as old as the hills.

95
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:51,940
Got it?

96
00:08:11,150 --> 00:08:12,950
You're in a mountain god temple.

97
00:08:12,950 --> 00:08:13,560
I

98
00:08:13,750 --> 00:08:15,409
am the Mountain God, Ying Lei!

99
00:08:16,150 --> 00:08:18,240
If you dare to offend me in my place,

100
00:08:18,550 --> 00:08:19,280
you'll end up

101
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:22,220
just like those people
crying out on the ground.

102
00:08:23,270 --> 00:08:24,310
Who is he?

103
00:08:24,490 --> 00:08:26,090
He sounds so full of himself.

104
00:08:26,230 --> 00:08:27,200
Half a demon.

105
00:08:28,190 --> 00:08:29,670
He is half-god and half-demon,

106
00:08:29,670 --> 00:08:31,730
a scion of the Mountain God Ying Zhao.

107
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:34,030
Did your grandpa let you

108
00:08:34,160 --> 00:08:35,540
leave home so easily?

109
00:08:36,980 --> 00:08:39,320
The Mountain God of the Wilderness
is already stuck in a mess

110
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:40,840
and has no time for me.

111
00:08:41,310 --> 00:08:42,240
The Wilderness?

112
00:08:43,380 --> 00:08:45,240
What happened in the Wilderness?

113
00:08:49,210 --> 00:08:50,840
After the Baize Token disappeared,

114
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:52,770
the Wilderness began to collapse.

115
00:08:53,110 --> 00:08:54,430
Grandfather and the others had to close

116
00:08:54,430 --> 00:08:55,620
the Kunlun Gate

117
00:08:56,039 --> 00:08:58,809
and cut off the connection
between the Wilderness and the mortal realm.

118
00:08:58,809 --> 00:09:00,940
That's how the collapse was relieved.

119
00:09:01,030 --> 00:09:02,070
But after that,

120
00:09:02,169 --> 00:09:03,870
another monster appeared,

121
00:09:04,059 --> 00:09:06,570
opening the Kunlun Gate by force
without authorization.

122
00:09:06,570 --> 00:09:08,870
Then loads of demons flocked
into the mortal world,

123
00:09:08,870 --> 00:09:10,050
causing chaos in both realms.

124
00:09:10,050 --> 00:09:11,170
That's the root

125
00:09:11,270 --> 00:09:13,630
of the further decreased and unsustainable

126
00:09:13,630 --> 00:09:15,230
spiritual energy in Kunlun.

127
00:09:16,090 --> 00:09:17,770
Grandpa and other Mountain Gods

128
00:09:17,770 --> 00:09:19,640
had no choice but to use their divine power

129
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:21,370
to barely maintain stability.

130
00:09:22,670 --> 00:09:25,200
But we don't know how long
they have to hold on.

131
00:09:28,280 --> 00:09:28,910
Ugh,

132
00:09:29,270 --> 00:09:30,270
so annoying.

133
00:09:30,790 --> 00:09:32,440
It’s all that Baize Goddess's fault.

134
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:33,580
The Wilderness is about to collapse,

135
00:09:33,580 --> 00:09:34,740
yet where is she?

136
00:09:51,860 --> 00:09:53,710
You are really unfilial.

137
00:09:53,730 --> 00:09:55,310
Your grandpa's fighting so hard in the Wilderness,

138
00:09:55,310 --> 00:09:57,420
while you're making a fuss
in the mortal world, huh?

139
00:09:57,420 --> 00:09:59,220
I'm not here for fun.

140
00:09:59,280 --> 00:10:00,590
I'm here to realize my dream.

141
00:10:00,590 --> 00:10:02,650
And my grandpa actually supports me.

142
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:06,100
Maybe he allowed me

143
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:08,850
to do it because he knew the Wilderness

144
00:10:08,890 --> 00:10:10,040
would be doomed.

145
00:10:15,500 --> 00:10:16,640
You come across

146
00:10:16,700 --> 00:10:18,410
as even worse this way.

147
00:10:20,210 --> 00:10:21,180
Who are you,

148
00:10:21,230 --> 00:10:22,050
yapping here nonstop?

149
00:10:22,050 --> 00:10:23,790
He is a great demon, for real.

150
00:10:23,870 --> 00:10:24,760
Are you scared?

151
00:10:24,950 --> 00:10:27,080
He feeds on those with beards like you.

152
00:10:27,300 --> 00:10:28,640
I don't care if he's a great demon or not!

153
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:30,260
I'm the boss of this place!

154
00:10:30,300 --> 00:10:31,830
-You know what... -Enough.

155
00:10:32,020 --> 00:10:33,030
Why should we stop

156
00:10:33,030 --> 00:10:34,830
to listen to two kids bickering?

157
00:10:35,110 --> 00:10:36,190
Alright, stop it.

158
00:10:36,920 --> 00:10:39,450
Show some respect
to those people over there.

159
00:10:39,470 --> 00:10:41,630
They are here to kill us seriously.

160
00:10:43,210 --> 00:10:43,600
Go!

161
00:10:44,070 --> 00:10:44,530
Shoo,

162
00:10:44,760 --> 00:10:45,230
shoo!

163
00:10:45,910 --> 00:10:46,830
Hurry up...

164
00:10:46,830 --> 00:10:47,390
Go!

165
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:49,320
Get up, or I'll kick you hard!

166
00:10:50,870 --> 00:10:52,080
It's getting late.

167
00:10:52,650 --> 00:10:54,200
Let's hurry up and hit the road.

168
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:57,000
What should we do
with this little demon in our way?

169
00:10:57,670 --> 00:10:59,170
Do we have to deal with him?

170
00:10:59,550 --> 00:11:01,550
If so, when it's done, the sun will set,

171
00:11:01,550 --> 00:11:03,190
and I'll be dead.

172
00:11:03,670 --> 00:11:05,770
This is the demon expert
in the Demon Hunting Bureau,

173
00:11:05,770 --> 00:11:07,950
who specializes in catching little demons like you.

174
00:11:07,950 --> 00:11:08,810
Mm,

175
00:11:09,310 --> 00:11:11,690
delicate-skinned demons are good.

176
00:11:12,070 --> 00:11:13,380
And half-god,

177
00:11:13,510 --> 00:11:15,070
half-demon types like you

178
00:11:15,270 --> 00:11:16,280
are even better.

179
00:11:17,710 --> 00:11:19,110
You think you can beat me?

180
00:11:20,330 --> 00:11:21,320
Kneel.

181
00:11:30,310 --> 00:11:31,120
Move.

182
00:11:36,870 --> 00:11:37,510
Stop.

183
00:11:37,530 --> 00:11:38,340
Stop.

184
00:11:38,710 --> 00:11:39,190
Okay.

185
00:11:39,260 --> 00:11:39,830
I give in.

186
00:11:41,890 --> 00:11:42,810
What is it?

187
00:11:43,070 --> 00:11:43,800
So powerful.

188
00:11:44,030 --> 00:11:45,270
It numbed my whole body

189
00:11:45,270 --> 00:11:46,330
and knocked me out.

190
00:11:46,590 --> 00:11:49,480
I know your mountain god temples hold a myriad of artifacts.

191
00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:53,150
If you don't wanna be taken back
to the Demon Hunting Bureau to suffer,

192
00:11:53,150 --> 00:11:55,190
just hand over

193
00:11:55,670 --> 00:11:56,900
your treasures.

194
00:12:08,810 --> 00:12:09,780
Fine...

195
00:12:12,090 --> 00:12:13,220
My precious pepper.

196
00:12:32,370 --> 00:12:33,890
What treasures are these?

197
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,730
Are you trying to fool us?

198
00:12:35,990 --> 00:12:37,190
They are my treasures!

199
00:12:37,190 --> 00:12:38,620
Treasures that lead me to my dream.

200
00:12:38,620 --> 00:12:40,490
It took me a lot of effort to collect them.

201
00:12:40,490 --> 00:12:41,750
You don't understand.

202
00:12:47,550 --> 00:12:50,120
I'm carrying my dream every day.

203
00:12:52,470 --> 00:12:53,590
Your dream

204
00:12:54,070 --> 00:12:55,290
is to carry the wok?

205
00:12:55,950 --> 00:12:56,880
It's to be a chef!

206
00:12:57,720 --> 00:13:00,580
A top chef who makes delicacies
in the mortal world!

207
00:13:03,780 --> 00:13:04,910
Everything's here.

208
00:13:09,270 --> 00:13:10,230
Not these.

209
00:13:22,300 --> 00:13:23,500
You mean this, right?

210
00:13:31,570 --> 00:13:32,720
What is it?

211
00:13:33,390 --> 00:13:34,830
An incense burner, I guess?

212
00:13:34,830 --> 00:13:35,700
This is the artifact

213
00:13:35,700 --> 00:13:37,600
that the Mountain Gods use

214
00:13:37,670 --> 00:13:39,310
to teleport across hills and peaks,

215
00:13:39,310 --> 00:13:40,840
called the Shanhai Portal.

216
00:13:40,870 --> 00:13:41,830
With it,

217
00:13:41,830 --> 00:13:44,890
we can rush back
to the Demon Hunting Bureau right away.

218
00:13:45,270 --> 00:13:46,480
How do we use it?

219
00:13:47,010 --> 00:13:49,070
This is the Mountain God's artifact.

220
00:13:49,170 --> 00:13:50,200
So of course,

221
00:13:50,510 --> 00:13:52,770
it needs the Mountain God to cast a spell.

222
00:13:53,910 --> 00:13:56,010
You just called me a little demon.

223
00:13:56,150 --> 00:13:57,950
Now you call me the Mountain God.

224
00:13:59,190 --> 00:14:00,080
So worldly.

225
00:14:00,710 --> 00:14:01,960
And this is mine.

226
00:14:01,960 --> 00:14:03,420
Why should I let you use it?

227
00:14:04,300 --> 00:14:05,470
If you help us,

228
00:14:05,470 --> 00:14:07,180
we will do you a favor too.

229
00:14:07,810 --> 00:14:08,790
What favor?

230
00:14:09,790 --> 00:14:10,750
I have neither desires

231
00:14:10,750 --> 00:14:12,030
nor anxiety.

232
00:14:14,460 --> 00:14:16,190
To help you realize your dream.

233
00:14:18,870 --> 00:14:20,360
Don't you want to be a chef?

234
00:14:20,620 --> 00:14:22,020
Our Demon Hunting Bureau

235
00:14:22,040 --> 00:14:23,300
happens to need a chef.

236
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:25,150
You...

237
00:14:28,210 --> 00:14:29,610
Don't you mind that I'm a demon?

238
00:14:29,610 --> 00:14:32,270
You just called yourself a little Mountain God.

239
00:14:32,510 --> 00:14:34,090
Of course, we don't mind it.

240
00:14:34,120 --> 00:14:37,120
The Demon Hunting Bureau deals with demons every day.

241
00:14:41,580 --> 00:14:42,830
And we have a large personnel,

242
00:14:42,830 --> 00:14:44,270
requiring various delicacies every day.

243
00:14:44,270 --> 00:14:45,420
We've also got servants

244
00:14:45,420 --> 00:14:48,130
specifically responsible for buying
all sorts of fresh daily ingredients.

245
00:14:48,130 --> 00:14:49,190
The whole kitchen

246
00:14:49,190 --> 00:14:51,310
is as large as your mountain god temple,

247
00:14:51,310 --> 00:14:53,910
providing a complete set of kitchenware.

248
00:15:04,310 --> 00:15:05,070
She's right.

249
00:15:09,150 --> 00:15:09,950
OK!

250
00:15:17,150 --> 00:15:18,410
The Shanhai Portal

251
00:15:18,590 --> 00:15:21,120
can only help you teleport to a place you know.

252
00:15:21,310 --> 00:15:22,870
Have you been to the Demon Hunting Bureau?

253
00:15:22,870 --> 00:15:23,700
Of course.

254
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:26,120
I've sneaked over there several times.

255
00:15:33,050 --> 00:15:34,010
Let's begin.

256
00:15:41,810 --> 00:15:42,530
Go!

257
00:15:43,370 --> 00:15:46,090
♫First time being in this world♫

258
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:51,610
♫Let me enjoy all the splendors♫

259
00:16:04,520 --> 00:16:07,440
♫Leaving home, going far away from those mountains♫

260
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:09,770
♫And that stream♫

261
00:16:10,270 --> 00:16:15,410
♫The boy wiped away his tears and sang♫

262
00:16:16,520 --> 00:16:19,370
♫He carried his dreams with him♫

263
00:16:19,420 --> 00:16:21,490
♫Jingling all the way♫

264
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:23,760
♫Wind, rain, and light♫

265
00:16:23,830 --> 00:16:26,980
♫Wandering with me♫

266
00:16:30,030 --> 00:16:31,730
Looks like the Demon Hunting Bureau

267
00:16:31,730 --> 00:16:33,200
can't solve the case.

268
00:16:35,240 --> 00:16:36,510
In that case,

269
00:16:38,020 --> 00:16:40,580
I'll send you to hell first.

270
00:17:03,430 --> 00:17:04,510
Mr. Zhen Mei.

271
00:17:33,950 --> 00:17:35,349
Mr. Fan Ying,

272
00:17:36,550 --> 00:17:38,210
the Water Ghost case has been solved.

273
00:17:38,210 --> 00:17:39,730
Our advance team of five

274
00:17:39,750 --> 00:17:40,859
is back to report.

275
00:17:50,859 --> 00:17:52,200
Let's wait and see.

276
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:19,460
Who is this?

277
00:18:19,530 --> 00:18:20,790
Nice to meet you, sirs.

278
00:18:20,990 --> 00:18:21,950
I'm Yinglei,

279
00:18:21,970 --> 00:18:23,800
a newbie in the Demon Hunting Bureau as a...

280
00:18:23,800 --> 00:18:24,710
A chef!

281
00:18:47,070 --> 00:18:49,560
The Water Ghost case is over.

282
00:18:49,870 --> 00:18:51,380
The Great Demon invited us

283
00:18:51,460 --> 00:18:52,910
to his home in the suburbs of Tiandu

284
00:18:52,910 --> 00:18:54,510
for a drink and celebration.

285
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:55,730
Sister Pei,

286
00:18:57,330 --> 00:18:58,590
are you coming with us?

287
00:19:07,660 --> 00:19:09,500
Even if you're leaving,

288
00:19:10,110 --> 00:19:12,440
you should at least bid a proper farewell.

289
00:19:19,150 --> 00:19:21,880
I've decided to stay
in the Demon Hunting Bureau.

290
00:19:25,710 --> 00:19:26,600
What's wrong?

291
00:19:27,750 --> 00:19:29,040
You don't want me to?

292
00:19:29,510 --> 00:19:30,960
I'd love to hear that!

293
00:19:30,280 --> 00:19:32,500
♫An arrow in the hand♫

294
00:19:33,110 --> 00:19:35,400
♫A string in the heart♫

295
00:19:36,030 --> 00:19:41,370
♫A backside standing, turning into forever♫

296
00:19:41,650 --> 00:19:43,940
♫The moon shines on the south♫

297
00:19:44,530 --> 00:19:46,790
♫But I look north♫

298
00:19:47,310 --> 00:19:52,390
♫I only hope the snow comes a bit later♫

299
00:19:50,680 --> 00:19:51,880
I didn't want to

300
00:19:52,710 --> 00:19:54,750
get involved in demon stuff anymore.

301
00:19:52,890 --> 00:19:55,220
♫Intimately bound together in the cold world♫

302
00:19:55,290 --> 00:19:58,030
♫Even death can't break our ties♫

303
00:19:57,510 --> 00:19:59,640
Or maybe I was just avoiding it.

304
00:19:58,140 --> 00:20:01,320
♫Like intertwined fates, debt, love, and hatred♫

305
00:20:00,560 --> 00:20:02,020
But in life,

306

♫Reluctant but with no resentment♫

307
00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:03,800
I see with my eyes,

00:20:04,140 --> 00:20:09,420
♫Only half of the bows and arrows remain♫

309
00:20:04,790 --> 00:20:05,920
listen with my ears,

310
00:20:06,840 --> 00:20:08,300
and observe with my heart,

311
00:20:09,590 --> 00:20:12,190
just to see through everything

312
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:14,870
♫Night and dawn are forever kept apart♫

313
00:20:12,950 --> 00:20:14,550
and live a sober life.

♫If you were a spring night♫

♫Why don't you remember♫

♫I'm always by your side?♫

322
00:20:31,230 --> 00:20:32,550

341
00:21:16,180 --> 00:21:19,340
♫I'm a black-and-white wound♫

342
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:21,990
♫You're the vibrant red color♫

343
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:24,830
♫How can I not remember♫

344
00:21:24,920 --> 00:21:27,560
♫You're always by my side?♫

345
00:21:27,590 --> 00:21:29,400
♫Like wind surrounding flowers♫

346
00:21:29,450 --> 00:21:37,680
♫Guarding the memories, never fading away♫

347
00:21:56,550 --> 00:21:58,010
Falling flowers,

348
00:21:58,440 --> 00:21:59,900
permeating fragrance.

349
00:22:01,070 --> 00:22:01,750
How is it?

350
00:22:02,270 --> 00:22:03,720
Isn't my place pretty nice?

351
00:22:03,720 --> 00:22:05,070
A seclusion in the bustling city,

352
00:22:05,070 --> 00:22:06,590
adorned with natural beauty.

353
00:22:06,590 --> 00:22:07,770
It is quite good.

354
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,390
But it doesn't feel like

355
00:22:09,390 --> 00:22:11,120
the kind of place you'd live in.

356
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:12,310
Oh?

357
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:15,250
I specially opened the barrier

358
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:17,220
to welcome all of you.

359
00:22:17,250 --> 00:22:19,160
Why are you so mean to me?

360
00:22:20,410 --> 00:22:22,210
Then tell me, Mr. Zhuo,

361
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:23,800
where should I live?

362
00:22:24,250 --> 00:22:25,580
The place you live

363
00:22:25,610 --> 00:22:27,920
should have corpses, bones, and blood

364
00:22:28,090 --> 00:22:29,520
all over.

365
00:22:31,190 --> 00:22:32,550
That suits your image.

366
00:22:35,580 --> 00:22:37,780
Only those soaked in blood

367
00:22:37,950 --> 00:22:39,670
love bathing, burning incense,

368
00:22:39,670 --> 00:22:41,200
and having flowers around.

369
00:22:41,430 --> 00:22:43,060
After all these years in the mortal world,

370
00:22:43,060 --> 00:22:44,350
my biggest gain

371
00:22:44,380 --> 00:22:46,070
is to learn that

372
00:22:47,270 --> 00:22:47,830
a human

373
00:22:48,390 --> 00:22:51,090
should know how to hide his true self.

374
00:22:53,790 --> 00:22:54,790
You're not human.

375
00:22:58,100 --> 00:22:59,780
So sharp all of a sudden.

376
00:22:59,800 --> 00:23:01,540
I didn't expect that.

377
00:23:07,340 --> 00:23:08,970
Zhuo Yichen, Zhuo Yichen.

378
00:23:08,990 --> 00:23:10,740
Zhao Yuanzhou, Zhao Yuanzhou.

379
00:23:20,990 --> 00:23:22,710
Let's celebrate our teamwork

380
00:23:22,740 --> 00:23:24,540
in solving the Water Ghost case.

381
00:23:24,630 --> 00:23:26,020
The crisis of the Demon Hunting Bureau

382
00:23:26,020 --> 00:23:27,540
has finally been resolved.

383
00:23:27,540 --> 00:23:29,030
The Demon Hunting Bureau survived,

384
00:23:29,030 --> 00:23:30,070
and so did I!

385
00:23:30,100 --> 00:23:30,940
Great!

386
00:23:31,050 --> 00:23:32,490
Don't get carried away.

387
00:23:32,550 --> 00:23:33,470
In the Demon Hunting Bureau,

388
00:23:33,470 --> 00:23:35,630
you may lose your life at any time.

389
00:23:36,750 --> 00:23:38,930
It's still not too late

390
00:23:38,950 --> 00:23:39,710
to quit now.

391
00:23:41,650 --> 00:23:43,250
I was a little scared before.

392
00:23:43,680 --> 00:23:44,580
But our team

393
00:23:44,670 --> 00:23:46,880
has Mr. Zhuo, the strongest one in Tiandu.

394
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:48,210
I'm not afraid anymore.

395
00:23:50,310 --> 00:23:51,950
When we were in danger,

396
00:23:52,190 --> 00:23:53,070
Mr. Zhuo

397
00:23:53,070 --> 00:23:54,870
was always protecting me.

398
00:23:56,710 --> 00:23:58,240
I can also protect you!

399
00:23:58,400 --> 00:23:59,880
I’m the Mountain God!

400
00:24:05,270 --> 00:24:07,460
Wen, hope you find
and get the Baize Token back soon.

401
00:24:07,460 --> 00:24:08,900
Then, those demons and monsters

402
00:24:08,900 --> 00:24:10,770
can't cause chaos in the mortal world

403
00:24:10,770 --> 00:24:12,170
and hurt humans anymore.

404
00:24:12,550 --> 00:24:14,360
No more tragedies like what happened

405
00:24:14,360 --> 00:24:16,100
to Ran Yi and Miss Qi.

406
00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:17,930
Mm.

407
00:24:17,960 --> 00:24:19,160
With the Baize Token,

408
00:24:19,160 --> 00:24:21,420
even the greatest demons are no big deal.

409
00:24:22,580 --> 00:24:23,420
Brilliant.

410
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:26,040
I swear I'll help you
find and retrieve it, Wen.

411
00:24:27,490 --> 00:24:28,700
Then my mom will...

412
00:24:31,710 --> 00:24:32,640
What did you say?

413
00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:34,560
Bai Jiu?

414
00:24:37,030 --> 00:24:38,130
Nothing.

415
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:40,620
Cheers.

416
00:24:41,430 --> 00:24:42,270
Cheers!

417
00:24:50,670 --> 00:24:52,300
Why is it tea for me?

418
00:24:53,050 --> 00:24:54,730
No alcohol for kids.

419
00:24:56,640 --> 00:24:58,870
You call me a kid.

420
00:24:59,030 --> 00:25:00,190
Then how old are you?

421
00:25:02,440 --> 00:25:05,020
I should be 18

422
00:25:05,540 --> 00:25:07,030
in human years.

423
00:25:07,830 --> 00:25:08,550
Eight...

424
00:25:09,110 --> 00:25:09,740
Eighteen?

425
00:25:10,360 --> 00:25:12,680
Eighteen with this thick beard?

426
00:25:15,060 --> 00:25:16,960
Guess it's time for a shave.

427
00:25:18,030 --> 00:25:20,810
I'll sneak into Zhao Yuanzhou's room later.

428
00:25:20,830 --> 00:25:22,490
He has no beard

429
00:25:22,550 --> 00:25:23,570
at his age.

430
00:25:23,790 --> 00:25:24,920
He must have a razor.

431
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:32,070
I'm gonna be ugly.

432
00:25:33,630 --> 00:25:35,000
Mirror, mirror,

433
00:25:35,150 --> 00:25:35,950
promise me.

434
00:25:36,680 --> 00:25:37,960
Please remember

435
00:25:38,150 --> 00:25:40,470
how handsome I look at over 200.

436
00:25:51,420 --> 00:25:52,220
Well...

437
00:25:53,030 --> 00:25:54,470
How can I refill my tea?

438
00:25:54,490 --> 00:25:55,750
I also want it.

439
00:25:55,780 --> 00:25:56,420
Come on.

440
00:25:56,950 --> 00:25:57,750
A little.

441
00:25:57,750 --> 00:25:58,610
That's enough.

442
00:26:25,030 --> 00:26:25,630
Wow.

443
00:26:26,070 --> 00:26:27,160
What is this?

444
00:26:33,900 --> 00:26:35,390
A kid's meal I made

445
00:26:35,390 --> 00:26:36,760
just for you!

446
00:26:36,790 --> 00:26:37,580
Let me try.

447
00:26:39,660 --> 00:26:40,790
How is it?

448
00:26:40,810 --> 00:26:42,160
How's my cooking?

449
00:26:42,190 --> 00:26:43,790
It tastes so good!

450
00:26:46,670 --> 00:26:47,650
By the way, Yinglei,

451
00:26:47,650 --> 00:26:49,930
I helped you realize your dream and become a chef

452
00:26:49,930 --> 00:26:51,610
in the Demon Hunting Bureau.

453
00:26:51,910 --> 00:26:53,070
So,

454
00:26:53,070 --> 00:26:54,670
shouldn't you repay me?

455
00:26:55,750 --> 00:26:56,870
No problem!

456
00:26:58,380 --> 00:27:00,590
Help me steal Zhao Yuanzhou's bottle.

457
00:27:04,130 --> 00:27:05,320
Well...

458
00:27:05,470 --> 00:27:06,270
That's...

459
00:27:07,420 --> 00:27:08,750
actually a big problem.

460
00:27:10,430 --> 00:27:12,500
I'm just curious

461
00:27:12,520 --> 00:27:15,030
what on earth is in his bottle.

462
00:27:15,130 --> 00:27:16,780
This Great Demon hasn't

463
00:27:16,800 --> 00:27:18,690
had anything the whole trip
but what's in his bottle.

464
00:27:18,690 --> 00:27:19,560
I got you!

465
00:27:22,180 --> 00:27:24,340
I've already sniffed out

466
00:27:24,360 --> 00:27:26,010
what's in his bottle.

467
00:27:26,660 --> 00:27:28,980
Jade bracelets!

468
00:27:30,890 --> 00:27:31,840
Sir,

469
00:27:31,950 --> 00:27:33,550
what kind of jade do you like?

470
00:27:33,810 --> 00:27:34,910
I have no preference.

471
00:27:34,910 --> 00:27:35,990
As long as it's jade.

472
00:27:35,990 --> 00:27:36,610
OK...

473
00:27:40,270 --> 00:27:41,110
Do you guys know

474
00:27:41,110 --> 00:27:42,530
jade cream?

475
00:27:42,710 --> 00:27:43,390
Jade cream?

476
00:27:52,870 --> 00:27:54,130
According to the book,

477
00:27:54,150 --> 00:27:56,220
the Mountain of Jade produces jade cream,

478
00:27:56,220 --> 00:27:58,120
which, mixed with the powdered Heartless Herb,

479
00:27:58,120 --> 00:27:59,640
can turn into liquid.

480
00:28:00,270 --> 00:28:01,200
Drink it,

481
00:28:01,470 --> 00:28:03,070
and you can become immortal.

482
00:28:03,380 --> 00:28:04,440
Not that powerful.

483
00:28:04,440 --> 00:28:05,640
That's to tease kids.

484
00:28:06,830 --> 00:28:07,800
But having plenty of it

485
00:28:07,800 --> 00:28:08,920
can prolong your life

486
00:28:08,920 --> 00:28:11,050
and replenish your spiritual energy.

487
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:13,950
No wonder that Great Demon

488
00:28:13,950 --> 00:28:16,330
holds his bottle every day
without letting go.

489
00:28:16,330 --> 00:28:18,130
So it's really his food reserve.

490
00:28:20,990 --> 00:28:22,140
The Great Demon

491
00:28:22,160 --> 00:28:24,250
was just chatting with Mr. Zhuo.

492
00:28:24,430 --> 00:28:25,830
But where is he now?

493
00:28:31,080 --> 00:28:32,740
How about we make another bet?

494
00:28:34,790 --> 00:28:35,790
Bet on what?

495
00:28:36,280 --> 00:28:39,630
Let's see who's the first to solve
the water ghost bride abduction case.

496
00:28:39,630 --> 00:28:40,700
The loser

497
00:28:41,240 --> 00:28:43,390
must do one thing for the other.

498
00:28:43,420 --> 00:28:44,220
Deal.

499
00:28:45,840 --> 00:28:47,080
But that thing

500
00:28:47,690 --> 00:28:50,090
should be within the loser's capabilities

501
00:28:50,560 --> 00:28:52,110
and can't be immoral.

502
00:28:53,690 --> 00:28:54,710
Keep your promise,

503
00:28:54,710 --> 00:28:55,710
Mr. Zhuo.

504
00:28:56,630 --> 00:28:58,060
You're pulling a long face.

505
00:28:58,060 --> 00:29:00,920
Don't tell me you have zero tolerance
even for this.

506
00:29:01,480 --> 00:29:03,340
Do you have eyes behind your back?

507
00:29:04,150 --> 00:29:05,640
I'm looking great.

508
00:29:08,260 --> 00:29:09,590
Wen Xiao and I were the first

509
00:29:09,590 --> 00:29:11,800
to solve the water ghost bride abduction case.

510
00:29:11,800 --> 00:29:14,170
You have such a poor memory, Mr. Zhuo.

511
00:29:14,510 --> 00:29:16,150
You said it yourself

512
00:29:16,270 --> 00:29:18,470
that I knew the murderer was Ran Yi

513
00:29:18,910 --> 00:29:21,240
before I came to the Demon Hunting Bureau.

514
00:29:21,500 --> 00:29:23,560
So I solved the case first, of course.

515
00:29:25,530 --> 00:29:26,790
I admit defeat.

516
00:29:27,280 --> 00:29:28,990
But you won unjustly.

517
00:29:29,780 --> 00:29:31,640
You knew Ran Yi committed a crime,

518
00:29:31,810 --> 00:29:33,610
yet you still colluded with him.

519
00:29:34,470 --> 00:29:35,790
You are accomplices.

520
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:39,900
Something's heavy on my head.

521
00:29:40,390 --> 00:29:41,640
My neck hurts.

522
00:29:43,810 --> 00:29:45,410
What's wrong with you again?

523
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:48,330
Someone put the "heavy" blame on me.

524
00:29:49,310 --> 00:29:49,910
You...

525
00:29:58,760 --> 00:29:59,860
I did this

526
00:30:00,670 --> 00:30:02,670
because I know you too well.

527
00:30:04,020 --> 00:30:05,510
Ridiculous.

528
00:30:06,140 --> 00:30:08,190
We've only known each other for a few days.

529
00:30:08,190 --> 00:30:09,380
You know me?

530
00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:12,470
Dream on.

531
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:15,220
Everyone in Tiandu knows

532
00:30:16,230 --> 00:30:17,350
Mr. Zhuo

533
00:30:17,350 --> 00:30:18,830
is handsome

534
00:30:18,830 --> 00:30:20,210
and charming.

535
00:30:20,230 --> 00:30:23,360
You're like a sharp sword
when dealing with evil demons,

536
00:30:23,390 --> 00:30:25,990
upholding justice,

537
00:30:26,150 --> 00:30:27,750
sticking to principles,

538
00:30:27,750 --> 00:30:29,390
and having ambition.

539
00:30:30,350 --> 00:30:31,710
Right?

540
00:30:33,950 --> 00:30:34,750
Indeed.

541
00:30:37,390 --> 00:30:38,390
So,

542
00:30:39,270 --> 00:30:40,630
if I had told you

543
00:30:40,630 --> 00:30:42,630
the murderer Ran Yi's whereabouts,

544
00:30:42,730 --> 00:30:45,070
the righteous Mr. Zhuo

545
00:30:45,420 --> 00:30:48,220
would have left in no time
to arrest Ran Yi for sure.

546
00:30:48,600 --> 00:30:51,730
Then how would we have found clues
about the Baize Token?

547
00:30:52,320 --> 00:30:54,950
The less flexible it is,
the easier it is to break.

548
00:30:54,950 --> 00:30:57,720
You can't stick to the rules too rigidly.

549
00:30:57,980 --> 00:30:59,450
To achieve a goal,

550
00:30:59,480 --> 00:31:02,290
sometimes we have to use special methods.

551
00:31:02,630 --> 00:31:03,740
Mr. Zhuo,

552
00:31:04,600 --> 00:31:05,920
am I right?

553
00:31:06,950 --> 00:31:08,200
Flexibility is okay,

554
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:10,410
but not always tricks and schemes.

555
00:31:16,780 --> 00:31:18,110
Could you push it for me?

556
00:31:19,080 --> 00:31:19,750
Move.

557
00:31:21,280 --> 00:31:21,960
You...

558
00:31:28,990 --> 00:31:30,890
You hid Ran Yi's whereabouts

559
00:31:30,920 --> 00:31:33,120
and even tried to drag us into your plan.

560
00:31:34,010 --> 00:31:35,540
It's obviously deception.

561
00:31:35,790 --> 00:31:37,980
Unfortunately, you are too smart.

562
00:31:38,590 --> 00:31:39,480
My plan failed.

563
00:31:39,720 --> 00:31:42,470
It doesn't mean you didn't do it.

564
00:31:43,140 --> 00:31:44,130
Zhao Yuanzhou,

565
00:31:44,700 --> 00:31:46,230
your eloquence

566
00:31:46,250 --> 00:31:47,580
can deceive Zhuo,

567
00:31:47,610 --> 00:31:48,920
but not me.

568
00:31:50,530 --> 00:31:51,860
She means you're goofy.

569
00:31:53,410 --> 00:31:53,990
I...

570
00:31:56,740 --> 00:31:58,030
Despite

571
00:31:58,140 --> 00:31:59,640
our different personalities

572
00:31:59,640 --> 00:32:01,040
and ways of doing things,

573
00:32:01,330 --> 00:32:03,070
we have the same goal.

574
00:32:03,400 --> 00:32:05,470
So we should be honest with each other

575
00:32:05,470 --> 00:32:06,110
and discuss more.

576
00:32:06,110 --> 00:32:06,910
Trust

577
00:32:07,770 --> 00:32:09,500
is like a swing.

578
00:32:09,890 --> 00:32:11,890
You must trust the people behind you

579
00:32:12,130 --> 00:32:13,620
to swing higher.

580
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:16,740
You are so good at pushing a swing.

581
00:32:17,090 --> 00:32:18,930
Don't you understand that?

582
00:32:27,110 --> 00:32:28,370
The little demon Ran Yi

583
00:32:29,660 --> 00:32:30,980
is not dangerous.

584
00:32:32,020 --> 00:32:33,020
What about Li Lun?

585
00:32:33,740 --> 00:32:35,590
You hid the existence of Li Lun,

586
00:32:35,590 --> 00:32:36,750
and he almost got Wen Xiao...

587
00:32:36,750 --> 00:32:38,550
Li Lun wouldn't really kill her.

588
00:32:40,060 --> 00:32:42,590
If Li Lun were serious about killing Wen Xiao,

589
00:32:43,510 --> 00:32:44,770
you couldn’t stop him.

590
00:32:48,360 --> 00:32:49,750
What is he up to?

591
00:32:54,590 --> 00:32:55,510
I don't know.

592
00:32:57,330 --> 00:32:58,510
It's always hard

593
00:32:59,690 --> 00:33:01,390
to read his mind.

594
00:33:05,740 --> 00:33:06,610
Move.

595
00:33:11,560 --> 00:33:13,300
Mr. Zhuo, you quit?

596
00:33:14,310 --> 00:33:16,950
Are you angry because I said

597
00:33:17,070 --> 00:33:18,700
you're too rigid?

598
00:33:19,590 --> 00:33:21,070
Didn't you just say

599
00:33:21,120 --> 00:33:22,420
you only like sitting on the swing,

600
00:33:22,420 --> 00:33:24,070
not pushing it?

601
00:33:24,310 --> 00:33:26,620
Aren't you enjoying pushing it now?

602
00:33:27,520 --> 00:33:30,010
Old liar.

603
00:33:30,750 --> 00:33:32,260
So that's why you're mad.

604
00:33:32,670 --> 00:33:33,700
Come here, then.

605
00:33:33,730 --> 00:33:34,930
Let me push it for you.

606
00:33:39,190 --> 00:33:40,230
Ridiculous.

607
00:33:41,050 --> 00:33:42,190
Adults

608
00:33:42,310 --> 00:33:44,110
are not obsessed with the swing!

609
00:33:48,320 --> 00:33:50,050
He's mocking you.

610
00:33:50,980 --> 00:33:52,090
Keep pushing.

611
00:33:53,870 --> 00:33:54,680
Move.

612
00:33:54,800 --> 00:33:57,200
They must be having fun with the swing, huh?

613
00:33:57,530 --> 00:33:58,590
Mr. Zhuo

614
00:33:58,590 --> 00:33:59,670
on the swing?

615
00:34:12,100 --> 00:34:14,100
Bai Jiu just said you...

616
00:34:14,490 --> 00:34:15,690
Is the wine good?

617
00:34:21,310 --> 00:34:22,330
Not bad!

618
00:34:22,360 --> 00:34:23,950
The pomegranate wine
from Tianxiang Pavilion

619
00:34:23,950 --> 00:34:25,950
is indeed worthy of its reputation.

620
00:34:26,130 --> 00:34:28,550
The smell is mellow and fragrant.

621
00:34:29,770 --> 00:34:31,150
Little Mountain God,

622
00:34:31,190 --> 00:34:33,850
you just came down the mountain
and already got so much info.

623
00:34:33,850 --> 00:34:35,460
You even know Tianxiang Pavilion?

624
00:34:35,460 --> 00:34:36,449
Yeah.

625
00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:40,670
When I just left the mountain,

626
00:34:40,670 --> 00:34:41,449
I heard that

627
00:34:41,480 --> 00:34:42,429
Tianxiang Pavilion

628
00:34:42,429 --> 00:34:44,090
was holding a beauty contest.

629
00:34:44,300 --> 00:34:45,800
There must be good wine

630
00:34:45,830 --> 00:34:47,159
as well as lovely girls.

631
00:34:48,810 --> 00:34:50,670
I'm thinking about finding a chance

632
00:34:50,670 --> 00:34:51,989
to have fun there one day.

633
00:34:51,989 --> 00:34:54,370
If you go, I'll tell Sister Wen.

634
00:34:59,440 --> 00:35:01,210
Unless you take me with you,

635
00:35:01,230 --> 00:35:02,420
and I won't tell her.

636
00:35:02,440 --> 00:35:03,360
You...

637
00:35:03,820 --> 00:35:04,870
You...

638
00:35:07,170 --> 00:35:08,130
Drink some more.

639
00:35:08,159 --> 00:35:08,870
C'mon...

640
00:35:08,870 --> 00:35:09,550
No, thanks.

641
00:35:10,190 --> 00:35:11,310
It's wet...

642
00:35:12,560 --> 00:35:13,900
It's okay. I'll hang it up to dry.

643
00:35:13,900 --> 00:35:15,110
Just a small patch is wet.

644
00:35:15,110 --> 00:35:16,440
Why bother?

645
00:35:25,670 --> 00:35:26,590
Sister Pei.

646
00:35:28,900 --> 00:35:30,300
You don't

647
00:35:30,330 --> 00:35:31,610
look so well.

648
00:35:33,820 --> 00:35:34,680
[File]

649
00:35:38,190 --> 00:35:40,390
There's another murder case in Tiandu.

[File]

652
00:36:25,240 --> 00:36:26,240
Where is Wen Xiao?

653
00:36:28,330 --> 00:36:31,060
She's on the swing
with Zhao Yuanzhou over there.

654
00:36:39,350 --> 00:36:41,030
What do you want to say?

655
00:36:44,270 --> 00:36:45,390
You would never

656
00:36:45,910 --> 00:36:47,470
let Wen Xiao

657
00:36:47,470 --> 00:36:49,110
be alone with him before.

658
00:36:56,780 --> 00:36:57,930
Mr. Zhuo,

659
00:36:58,830 --> 00:37:00,430
You're innocent and kind.

660
00:37:00,810 --> 00:37:01,790
Don't easily

661
00:37:01,790 --> 00:37:03,590
let down your guard against him.

662
00:37:11,450 --> 00:37:13,320
I'll never let my guard down.

663
00:37:33,440 --> 00:37:35,480
Is everything ready?

664
00:37:35,630 --> 00:37:37,430
The file

665
00:37:37,450 --> 00:37:39,880
has been delivered to Pei Sijing.

666
00:37:42,150 --> 00:37:43,520
Thanks to you,

667
00:37:43,930 --> 00:37:45,210
the fish took the bait.

668
00:37:46,940 --> 00:37:49,700
Pei Sijing saw his face.

669
00:37:50,750 --> 00:37:52,810
She will definitely investigate it.

670
00:37:55,240 --> 00:37:57,670
It’s time to let them know

671
00:37:58,750 --> 00:38:00,630
where the Baize Token is.

672
00:38:01,860 --> 00:38:03,480
Aren’t you afraid that old demon

673
00:38:03,480 --> 00:38:04,670
might kill them?

674
00:38:04,920 --> 00:38:07,440
That old demon is indeed powerful.

675
00:38:08,390 --> 00:38:09,820
I'm scared of him too.

676
00:38:10,910 --> 00:38:13,870
But I want Zhao Yuanzhou and his crew

677
00:38:14,370 --> 00:38:15,670
to suffer.

678
00:38:18,770 --> 00:38:21,370
Can Zhao Yuanzhou really find the Baize Token?

679
00:38:53,880 --> 00:38:55,250
According to the file,

680
00:38:55,590 --> 00:38:57,020
since two days ago,

681
00:38:57,280 --> 00:39:00,510
two households in Tiandu
have been murdered consecutively,

682
00:39:00,510 --> 00:39:02,120
both happening at noon.

683
00:39:02,680 --> 00:39:04,370
No signs of a struggle inside.

684
00:39:04,870 --> 00:39:06,790
It's not a robbery.

685
00:39:24,830 --> 00:39:26,760
Actually, there is another reason

686
00:39:28,370 --> 00:39:30,230
why I'm investigating this case.

687
00:39:30,330 --> 00:39:31,130
What is it?

688
00:39:44,710 --> 00:39:47,770
This is the household
where the first murder occurred.

689
00:39:49,040 --> 00:39:50,570
There's no demonic energy.

690
00:39:52,110 --> 00:39:53,390
My sword is not shining.

691
00:39:53,390 --> 00:39:54,590
I don't need you to tell me.

692
00:39:54,590 --> 00:39:55,830
Yeah...

693
00:39:55,830 --> 00:39:57,390
Awesome...

694
00:40:01,500 --> 00:40:02,800
No blood,

695
00:40:04,360 --> 00:40:06,190
nor signs of fighting.

696
00:40:07,540 --> 00:40:09,090
It looks pretty normal.

697
00:40:09,700 --> 00:40:11,300
It's just that no one is here.

698
00:40:12,470 --> 00:40:13,670
Appearing too normal

699
00:40:14,230 --> 00:40:15,560
is actually an anomaly.

700
00:40:16,710 --> 00:40:18,510
Your Bingyi Clan's sense of humor

701
00:40:18,510 --> 00:40:19,990
is hard to understand.

702
00:40:24,870 --> 00:40:26,120
Give me your hand.

703
00:40:30,570 --> 00:40:31,840
Is it necessary?

704
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:36,100
You're so scared.

705
00:40:41,090 --> 00:40:42,680
Are you serious?

706
00:40:44,440 --> 00:40:46,640
Let me borrow some demon blood of yours.

707
00:40:46,750 --> 00:40:48,130
Last time at the Mirror Lake,

708
00:40:48,130 --> 00:40:48,900
I found

709
00:40:48,920 --> 00:40:51,120
your blood on the Cloud Light Sword

710
00:40:51,710 --> 00:40:52,840
made its power soar.

711
00:41:00,950 --> 00:41:04,020
Is this the so-called “bloody bad luck”?

712
00:41:11,690 --> 00:41:14,610
♫Can't tell tears from wine♫

713
00:41:14,670 --> 00:41:16,850
♫So frustrating♫

714
00:41:17,340 --> 00:41:22,610
♫The moon and the puppy go with me silently♫

715
00:41:23,400 --> 00:41:26,330
♫Time never stops♫

716
00:41:24,100 --> 00:41:24,710
Ouch...

717
00:41:24,710 --> 00:41:25,910
It hurts...

718
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:28,270
♫The boy never looks back♫

719
00:41:28,610 --> 00:41:34,050
♫He left his hometown and love behind♫

720
00:41:28,870 --> 00:41:30,430
Why are we in the same squad?

721
00:41:31,040 --> 00:41:32,210
Bloody bad luck...

722
00:41:34,350 --> 00:41:35,590
What are you afraid of?

723
00:41:35,590 --> 00:41:36,400
I'm here.

724
00:41:36,430 --> 00:41:37,140
Let's go.

725
00:41:38,470 --> 00:41:40,600
Is this their strategic arrangement?

726
00:41:40,800 --> 00:41:41,960
In their eyes,

727
00:41:41,990 --> 00:41:43,250
we're...

728
00:41:43,990 --> 00:41:45,450
-Discarded pawns. -Aces.

729
00:41:48,790 --> 00:41:50,340
Aren't you half-god, half-demon?

730
00:41:50,340 --> 00:41:52,270
Are you actually half-pig-demon?

731
00:41:52,890 --> 00:41:53,820
What do you mean?

732
00:41:54,090 --> 00:41:55,950
I'm saying you're as dumb as a pig.

733
00:41:59,950 --> 00:42:00,670
Jiu,

734
00:42:00,800 --> 00:42:01,230
you...

735
00:42:01,670 --> 00:42:04,000
You're getting better at mocking others.

736
00:42:23,260 --> 00:42:25,340
No plum trees in the yard.

737
00:42:27,030 --> 00:42:28,990
Where did these petals come from?

738
00:42:31,950 --> 00:42:33,670
The plates are still warm.

739
00:42:36,820 --> 00:42:38,080
That means...

740
00:43:07,560 --> 00:43:09,090
The murderer is still here.

741
00:44:05,900 --> 00:44:06,700
Sister.
