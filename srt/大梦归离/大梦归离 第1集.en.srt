175
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:50,880
Do you know

176
00:13:51,430 --> 00:13:53,230
the flower language of laurels?

177
00:13:59,450 --> 00:14:01,780
Now, Mr. Zhang has suffered heavy losses.

178
00:14:01,870 --> 00:14:05,200
His wife suspected he was using money to care for a mistress.

179
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:07,720
He had no choice but to report to the authorities to arrest you.

180
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:11,200
[Selling Grains]

181
00:14:08,070 --> 00:14:09,230
You old thing,

182
00:14:09,230 --> 00:14:10,390
you're shameless!

183
00:14:10,390 --> 00:14:11,330
I'm going to report this to the authorities.

184
00:14:11,330 --> 00:14:12,990
I'm going to report this to the authorities.

185
00:14:12,990 --> 00:14:14,700
As for the talented Wang?

186
00:14:15,230 --> 00:14:17,070
You deceived him and stole his heart.

187
00:14:17,070 --> 00:14:19,010
He's been devastated ever since,

188
00:14:19,230 --> 00:14:21,310
crying his eyes out every day.

189
00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:28,710
Beautiful women have always been fickle.

190
00:14:29,910 --> 00:14:30,990
Xiao'e,

191
00:14:31,830 --> 00:14:34,300
you're really something.

192
00:14:34,830 --> 00:14:37,030
Sister, don't listen to such nonsense.

193
00:14:37,030 --> 00:14:39,910
Mr. Zhang is known as a great philanthropist in the area.

194
00:14:39,910 --> 00:14:41,950
He heard this year's drought led to a poor harvest,

195
00:14:41,950 --> 00:14:43,390
so he spent a lot of money

196
00:14:43,390 --> 00:14:45,030
to stockpile grain from nearby towns

197
00:14:45,030 --> 00:14:46,290
and villages.

198
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:48,390
He said it was for the people of Tiandu to have

199
00:14:48,390 --> 00:14:50,920
food in their bowls when grain became scarce.

200
00:14:51,030 --> 00:14:52,590
How could I possibly have deceived him?

201
00:14:52,590 --> 00:14:56,320
I swear if I had deceived a good person, I'd get struck by lightning.

202
00:15:03,060 --> 00:15:04,890
The rain is getting heavier.

203
00:15:05,190 --> 00:15:07,130
Why are you closing your umbrella?

204
00:15:07,390 --> 00:15:08,110
Yes.

205
00:15:08,630 --> 00:15:09,960
I understand now.

206
00:15:11,270 --> 00:15:12,670
Heaven understands too.

207
00:15:15,910 --> 00:15:17,630
Mr. Zhang is hoarding goods

208
00:15:17,630 --> 00:15:19,230
to make exorbitant profits.

209
00:15:19,270 --> 00:15:20,510
He's a profiteer.

210
00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:26,500
And what about Wang?

211
00:15:28,630 --> 00:15:30,030
Young Master Wang

212
00:15:30,080 --> 00:15:31,680
is incredibly talented.

213
00:15:31,870 --> 00:15:33,590
From courtesans in brothels

214
00:15:33,630 --> 00:15:35,200
to daughters of wealthy families,

215
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:38,330
everyone is captivated by his knowledge and character.

216
00:15:38,830 --> 00:15:41,290
Young Master Wang has admirers everywhere.

217
00:15:41,310 --> 00:15:42,070
For my sake,

218
00:15:42,070 --> 00:15:44,030
he abandoned his former lover.

219
00:15:44,270 --> 00:15:45,030
I see.

220
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:47,540
Young Master Wang is fickle,

221
00:15:47,540 --> 00:15:48,590
hypocritical,

222
00:15:48,820 --> 00:15:50,390
and a scoundrel who is all show

223
00:15:50,390 --> 00:15:52,150
but no substance.

224
00:15:53,190 --> 00:15:54,350
What are you saying?

225
00:15:54,350 --> 00:15:56,160
Our love is true and strong.

226
00:15:56,990 --> 00:15:57,480
Yes.

227
00:15:57,660 --> 00:15:58,470
You two

228
00:15:58,530 --> 00:15:59,790
are just pretending.

229
00:16:00,530 --> 00:16:01,170
Let's go.

230
00:16:01,590 --> 00:16:03,870
I really haven't done anything wrong.

231
00:16:03,950 --> 00:16:05,430
You know very well

232
00:16:05,430 --> 00:16:06,670
that this is wrong.

233
00:16:07,230 --> 00:16:08,380
The world is full of all kinds of people,

234
00:16:08,380 --> 00:16:09,910
both good and evil.

235
00:16:10,110 --> 00:16:11,870
Bad people will face human laws

236
00:16:11,870 --> 00:16:13,800
and receive their due punishment.

237
00:16:13,990 --> 00:16:15,430
You've deceived people for money and lust.

238
00:16:15,430 --> 00:16:17,230
Although your initial intentions may have been good,

239
00:16:17,230 --> 00:16:19,230
you've still disturbed the peace of the mortal world.

240
00:16:19,230 --> 00:16:20,890
You should also face justice.

241
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:25,280
Don't worry. It's not a serious matter.

242
00:16:25,350 --> 00:16:26,190
You'll be imprisoned for a few months

243
00:16:26,190 --> 00:16:28,250
and then sent back to the Wilderness.

244
00:16:31,110 --> 00:16:32,710
Why are you so nervous?

245
00:16:33,020 --> 00:16:33,790
No.

246
00:16:33,870 --> 00:16:34,510
Sister,

247
00:16:34,630 --> 00:16:35,390
look.

248
00:16:37,190 --> 00:16:37,910
Hya!

249
00:16:38,710 --> 00:16:39,510
Hya!

250
00:16:41,030 --> 00:16:41,830
Hya!

251
00:16:43,030 --> 00:16:45,160
The people from Chongwu Camp are here.

252
00:16:46,700 --> 00:16:47,850
Easy.

253
00:16:49,760 --> 00:16:51,200
Hand over the demon to us.

254
00:16:52,520 --> 00:16:54,580
I am the Archivist of the Demon Hunting Bureau.

255
00:16:54,580 --> 00:16:57,790
I have the authority to take the Deceptive Beast back to the Demon Hunting Bureau.

256
00:16:57,790 --> 00:16:59,250
The Demon Hunting Bureau?

257
00:16:59,900 --> 00:17:01,760
The moss and cobwebs in your courtyard

258
00:17:01,760 --> 00:17:03,220
must be quite thick by now.

259
00:17:03,280 --> 00:17:05,670
It's a dilapidated place that exists in name only.

260
00:17:05,670 --> 00:17:07,680
You dare to compete for authority with the Chongwu Camp?

261
00:17:07,680 --> 00:17:08,540
Step aside now.

262
00:17:10,940 --> 00:17:12,150
The Deceptive Beast is weak

263
00:17:12,150 --> 00:17:13,810
and has little magical power.

264
00:17:14,069 --> 00:17:15,550
Although it lies,

265
00:17:15,569 --> 00:17:17,550
it only deceives those who do evil.

266
00:17:17,900 --> 00:17:20,000
It should be punished according to its crimes,

267
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,000
but its crimes don't warrant death.

268
00:17:22,420 --> 00:17:24,630
You were saved by a demon when you were young,

269
00:17:24,630 --> 00:17:26,710
so you've always had a soft spot for demons.

270
00:17:26,710 --> 00:17:29,370
As a result, you've let many evil demons escape.

271
00:17:30,060 --> 00:17:31,520
However, eight years ago,

272
00:17:31,590 --> 00:17:33,130
the extremely evil demon Zhu Yan

273
00:17:33,130 --> 00:17:35,530
caused heavy casualties to the Demon Hunting Bureau,

274
00:17:35,530 --> 00:17:37,140
almost destroying it.

275
00:17:37,630 --> 00:17:38,960
If he were here,

276
00:17:39,390 --> 00:17:41,560
would you still plead for him?

277
00:17:44,510 --> 00:17:46,040
The words of a vicious beast

278
00:17:46,760 --> 00:17:48,620
are absolutely not to be trusted.

279
00:17:49,830 --> 00:17:50,990
Today,

280
00:17:52,110 --> 00:17:54,510
I will definitely kill you to take revenge.

281
00:17:57,440 --> 00:17:58,990
My patience has run out.

282
00:17:59,010 --> 00:18:00,380
Mine ran out long ago.

283
00:18:01,650 --> 00:18:04,220
If Mr. Fan hadn't just appeared to stop me...

284
00:18:15,580 --> 00:18:17,120
You can kill me.

285
00:18:18,050 --> 00:18:20,830
But all the guards here—

286
00:18:22,850 --> 00:18:24,750
the four on the roof,

287
00:18:25,430 --> 00:18:27,940
seven behind the corridor,

288
00:18:28,650 --> 00:18:30,560
five by the pillars—

289
00:18:33,630 --> 00:18:35,590
a total of sixteen lives

290
00:18:35,590 --> 00:18:38,200
would all die with me.

291
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:42,710
Their hearts would burst and they would perish.

292
00:18:45,450 --> 00:18:47,050
Like this.

293
00:18:57,600 --> 00:19:00,000
The demon beast Zhu Yan kills and does evil,

294
00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:03,000
but the Chongwu Camp kills to stop killing.

295
00:19:03,010 --> 00:19:05,140
How is that any different from Zhu Yan?

296
00:19:05,350 --> 00:19:06,390
Enough talk.

297
00:19:06,910 --> 00:19:07,790
Attack!

298
00:19:26,550 --> 00:19:27,610
Sister,

299
00:19:28,110 --> 00:19:30,310
are you still acting at a time like this?

300
00:19:31,350 --> 00:19:32,870
I'm not acting.

301
00:19:33,560 --> 00:19:34,860
Are you alright?

302
00:19:36,580 --> 00:19:37,590
Go.

303
00:19:43,340 --> 00:19:44,130
Go!

304
00:19:45,790 --> 00:19:46,580
Go!

305
00:20:01,210 --> 00:20:02,450
Hurry!

306
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:29,820
The Chongwu Camp is ordered to eliminate demons.

307
00:20:29,820 --> 00:20:31,340
It is our duty.

308
00:20:31,370 --> 00:20:32,850
Weapons are merciless.

309
00:20:32,950 --> 00:20:35,630
You people from the Demon Hunting Bureau insist on obstructing us.

310
00:20:35,630 --> 00:20:39,150
Any injuries sustained are not the responsibility of the Chongwu Camp.

311
00:20:39,150 --> 00:20:40,110
Farewell.

312
00:20:40,790 --> 00:20:41,630
Hya!

313
00:20:42,070 --> 00:20:42,710
Hya!

314
00:20:46,990 --> 00:20:47,860
Sister.

315
00:20:52,650 --> 00:20:53,710
Thank you.

316
00:20:57,670 --> 00:20:59,190
Are you blaming me?

317
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:09,760
Indeed, it is my fault.

318
00:21:12,950 --> 00:21:13,830
I'm sorry.

319
00:21:16,210 --> 00:21:17,880
I'm too useless.

♫A dream♫

345
00:22:33,550 --> 00:22:34,850
♫A pair of hands♫

346
00:22:35,070 --> 00:22:37,160
♫A cup of wine♫

347
00:22:38,910 --> 00:22:40,440
I'll count down from three.

348
00:22:41,070 --> 00:22:43,320
Will you sheathe your sword or not?

349
00:22:45,590 --> 00:22:46,590
Three.

350
00:22:51,230 --> 00:22:52,230
Two.

351
00:22:57,440 --> 00:22:58,430
One.

352
00:23:11,470 --> 00:23:12,590
Does it feel bad?

353
00:23:13,550 --> 00:23:15,220
Good.

354
00:23:16,270 --> 00:23:18,140
Nine out of ten

355
00:23:19,230 --> 00:23:20,910
worldly affairs

356
00:23:21,510 --> 00:23:23,510
don't go according to one's wishes.

357
00:23:25,010 --> 00:23:26,160
Mr. Zhuo,

358
00:23:28,540 --> 00:23:30,310
you'd better get used to it.

359
00:23:30,910 --> 00:23:32,500
You despicable villain!

360
00:23:33,880 --> 00:23:35,430
One day,

361
00:23:36,180 --> 00:23:38,000
I will use the Cloud Light Sword

362
00:23:39,040 --> 00:23:41,150
to pierce your heart.

363
00:23:51,970 --> 00:23:53,710
Like this?

364
00:23:55,910 --> 00:23:58,170
I already told you earlier.

365
00:24:00,070 --> 00:24:00,780
You

366
00:24:02,840 --> 00:24:04,750
can't kill me.

367
00:24:08,670 --> 00:24:09,790
Zhu Yan!

368
00:24:09,810 --> 00:24:10,610
What's wrong?

369
00:24:10,680 --> 00:24:12,720
Does it feel even worse now?

370
00:24:16,790 --> 00:24:17,820
Zhuo,

371
00:24:18,580 --> 00:24:20,710
the bigger picture is more important.

372
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:22,780
Zhu Yan,

373
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:25,760
what exactly are you up to?

374
00:24:43,300 --> 00:24:46,960
You proposed to the court to rebuild the Demon Hunting Bureau.

375
00:24:47,720 --> 00:24:50,720
Although the Prime Minister strongly vouched for it,

376
00:24:51,410 --> 00:24:53,990
the Chongwu Camp is interfering.

377
00:24:54,630 --> 00:24:56,960
King Xiang hasn't given his approval yet.

378
00:24:57,270 --> 00:24:58,950
I came here today

379
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,750
to give you a gift.

380
00:25:05,990 --> 00:25:07,590
What gift?

381
00:25:10,470 --> 00:25:11,340
Me.

382
00:25:13,610 --> 00:25:15,720
Capture the great demon Zhu Yan

383
00:25:16,990 --> 00:25:19,020
and bring him to justice.

384
00:25:19,800 --> 00:25:21,610
Get your credit and reward.

385
00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:27,200
Mr. Zhuo,

386
00:25:28,740 --> 00:25:29,930
are you satisfied

387
00:25:30,950 --> 00:25:32,720
with this gift?

388
00:25:32,750 --> 00:25:34,740
Not satisfied enough.

389
00:25:35,650 --> 00:25:37,160
Still not enough?

390
00:25:39,980 --> 00:25:42,220
You are truly greedy.

391
00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:47,750
Then how can I satisfy you?

392
00:25:49,630 --> 00:25:50,910
Are you satisfied now?

393
00:25:52,150 --> 00:25:53,990
I will kill you sooner or later.

394
00:25:58,750 --> 00:26:00,010
I hope you

395
00:26:00,650 --> 00:26:01,840
will keep your word.

396
00:26:15,710 --> 00:26:16,440
Ms. Wen,

397
00:26:16,500 --> 00:26:17,830
you're finally back.

398
00:26:17,950 --> 00:26:19,560
Why is your face so pale?

399
00:26:19,830 --> 00:26:21,080
Is something wrong?

400
00:26:22,710 --> 00:26:23,350
A demon.

401
00:26:24,650 --> 00:26:25,850
There's a demon here?

402
00:26:28,700 --> 00:26:30,480
If there is a demon in the Demon Hunting Bureau,

403
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:32,340
then this demon must be very bold.

404
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:34,120
Not only is he bold,

405
00:26:34,300 --> 00:26:35,830
he's big all over.

406
00:26:36,800 --> 00:26:37,970
He's a great demon.

407
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:40,170
Oh.

408
00:26:40,620 --> 00:26:42,020
What kind of great demon?

409
00:26:42,380 --> 00:26:43,190
I don't know,

410
00:26:43,960 --> 00:26:45,780
but I heard Mr. Zhuo call him…

411
00:26:46,890 --> 00:26:47,780
Call him...

412
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:50,010
Call him Zhu Yan.

413
00:27:15,880 --> 00:27:17,250
He has a first and last name.

414
00:27:17,250 --> 00:27:18,750
His household registration can be checked.

415
00:27:18,750 --> 00:27:20,340
He's a resident of Tiandu.

416
00:27:20,360 --> 00:27:21,580
Zhao Yuanzhou,

417
00:27:21,700 --> 00:27:23,170
twenty-nine years old.

418
00:27:23,840 --> 00:27:25,030
He really is a demon.

419
00:27:25,240 --> 00:27:26,640
An extremely evil demon.

420
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:28,390
His cultivation is profound.

421
00:27:28,390 --> 00:27:29,760
Taking human form

422
00:27:30,030 --> 00:27:31,430
is not difficult for him.

423
00:27:32,430 --> 00:27:34,000
Why can't your Cloud Light Sword

424
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:35,280
kill him?

425
00:27:36,670 --> 00:27:37,400
I don't know.

426
00:27:37,890 --> 00:27:39,120
Do you want to know?

427
00:27:42,930 --> 00:27:45,030
You're eavesdropping on our conversation.

428
00:27:45,030 --> 00:27:45,870
Despicable.

429
00:27:47,030 --> 00:27:48,030
Eavesdropping?

430
00:27:48,510 --> 00:27:50,080
I didn't even move.

431
00:27:50,200 --> 00:27:52,290
Mr. Fan and I were whispering,

432
00:27:52,360 --> 00:27:53,650
yet you could hear us.

433
00:27:54,800 --> 00:27:56,530
You're not a monkey.

434
00:27:56,790 --> 00:27:57,700
You're a dog.

435
00:27:57,810 --> 00:27:59,870
I think dogs have a sharp sense of smell.

436
00:27:59,870 --> 00:28:00,400
You—

437
00:28:00,900 --> 00:28:02,230
Mr. Zhuo, don't forget.

438
00:28:02,670 --> 00:28:04,710
I am a thousand-year-old great demon.

439
00:28:04,710 --> 00:28:06,350
My five senses are extraordinary.

440
00:28:06,350 --> 00:28:08,150
No matter how far away you stand,

441
00:28:08,500 --> 00:28:11,490
it's as if you're...

442
00:28:13,970 --> 00:28:15,860
whispering right next to my ear.

443
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:17,020
How dare you!

444
00:28:17,160 --> 00:28:18,820
Who's whispering in your ear?

445
00:28:21,130 --> 00:28:23,130
Do you want to know the answer or not?

446
00:28:23,150 --> 00:28:24,720
You keep getting off topic.

447
00:28:24,950 --> 00:28:26,030
So annoying.

448
00:28:28,160 --> 00:28:29,760
Just say what you have to say.

449
00:28:30,500 --> 00:28:32,700
You are a descendant of the Bingyi Clan.

450
00:28:34,850 --> 00:28:36,390
The bloodline of the Bingyi Clan

451
00:28:36,390 --> 00:28:39,720
has always been the nemesis of the demons of the Wilderness.

452
00:28:40,460 --> 00:28:41,830
The power of the Cloud Light Sword

453
00:28:41,830 --> 00:28:44,100
is enough to slay gods and demons.

454
00:28:44,430 --> 00:28:45,360
However…

455
00:28:50,100 --> 00:28:51,130
However what?

456
00:28:52,560 --> 00:28:54,220
You're using it incorrectly.

457
00:28:57,570 --> 00:28:58,630
How should I use it?

458
00:28:59,790 --> 00:29:02,320
This is the highest secret of the Bingyi Clan.

459
00:29:02,470 --> 00:29:05,070
I must whisper it to Mr. Zhuo.

460
00:29:05,370 --> 00:29:07,500
It must not be overheard by outsiders.

461
00:29:12,280 --> 00:29:14,010
What a pity about these chains.

462
00:29:15,240 --> 00:29:16,040
Zhuo.

463
00:29:18,200 --> 00:29:19,430
Demons are cunning.

464
00:29:19,430 --> 00:29:20,390
Don't be fooled.

465
00:29:20,680 --> 00:29:21,600
Zhao Yuanzhou.

466
00:29:21,660 --> 00:29:23,270
You said in your letter

467
00:29:23,290 --> 00:29:24,730
that you could help the Demon Hunting Bureau

468
00:29:24,730 --> 00:29:26,190
solve the recent cases in Tiandu City

469
00:29:26,190 --> 00:29:29,190
of water ghosts abducting brides and killing people.

470
00:29:29,390 --> 00:29:30,950
Is this true?

471
00:29:31,030 --> 00:29:32,250
Why would you help the Demon Hunting Bureau

472
00:29:32,250 --> 00:29:33,770
for no good reason?

473
00:29:33,940 --> 00:29:35,800
You must have an ulterior motive.

474
00:29:36,100 --> 00:29:37,810
I have no desires or demands.

475
00:29:37,950 --> 00:29:40,810
I sincerely want to help the Demon Hunting Bureau.

476
00:29:41,540 --> 00:29:43,270
For many years, the Chongwu Camp

477
00:29:43,270 --> 00:29:45,380
has been wantonly slaughtering demons and beasts.

478
00:29:45,380 --> 00:29:46,640
As a great demon,

479
00:29:47,390 --> 00:29:50,020
I naturally want to help the lesser demons take revenge.

480
00:29:50,020 --> 00:29:51,260
The enemy of my enemy

481
00:29:51,510 --> 00:29:52,550
is my friend.

482
00:29:53,230 --> 00:29:54,390
This is written in

483
00:29:54,390 --> 00:29:56,000
your human military strategy,

484
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:56,810
right?

485
00:29:58,790 --> 00:30:00,070
But eight years ago,

486
00:30:01,150 --> 00:30:02,710
the Demon Hunting Bureau was destroyed

487
00:30:02,710 --> 00:30:04,640
and the Chongwu Camp gained power.

488
00:30:06,730 --> 00:30:09,200
This was all thanks to you.

489
00:30:11,630 --> 00:30:14,190
The deep feud for killing my father and brothers

490
00:30:14,190 --> 00:30:15,960
is something I must avenge.

491
00:30:17,670 --> 00:30:20,010
Anyone can help the Demon Hunting Bureau,

492
00:30:22,590 --> 00:30:24,350
except you.

493
00:30:25,730 --> 00:30:27,960
Don't you mortals have a saying

494
00:30:28,590 --> 00:30:29,230
that goes,

495
00:30:30,070 --> 00:30:31,820
"To know one's fault and be willing to change

496
00:30:31,820 --> 00:30:33,320
is the greatest virtue"?

497
00:30:36,920 --> 00:30:40,050
Are you really willing to help the Demon Hunting Bureau?

498
00:30:41,340 --> 00:30:42,960
I'll give my all

499
00:30:43,220 --> 00:30:45,080
and dedicate myself completely.

500
00:30:46,620 --> 00:30:48,350
However, I have one condition.

501
00:30:50,300 --> 00:30:52,700
You just said you had no desires or demands.

502
00:30:53,630 --> 00:30:55,560
Indeed, your mouth is full of lies.

503
00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:56,860
What's the condition?

504
00:30:58,990 --> 00:31:01,450
I want someone from the Demon Hunting Bureau

505
00:31:02,620 --> 00:31:04,880
to accompany me in investigating cases.

506
00:31:05,860 --> 00:31:06,980
Who?

507
00:31:08,740 --> 00:31:10,310
It's someone you both know.

508
00:31:11,630 --> 00:31:13,480
Commander Fan Ying,

509
00:31:13,550 --> 00:31:15,030
it's your daughter,

510
00:31:16,530 --> 00:31:18,230
Ms. Wen Xiao.

511
00:31:21,460 --> 00:31:22,720
Mr. Zhuo has ordered

512
00:31:22,750 --> 00:31:24,950
that no one is allowed near the dungeon.

513
00:31:25,070 --> 00:31:26,220
Not even me?

514
00:31:26,760 --> 00:31:28,230
Not even you, Ms. Wen.

515
00:31:31,150 --> 00:31:32,300
Don't even think about it.

516
00:31:32,300 --> 00:31:33,760
Don't even think about it?

517
00:31:34,650 --> 00:31:36,310
Not only will I think about it,

518
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:38,080
but I will also do it.

519
00:31:40,680 --> 00:31:42,600
I'm the one making demands now.

520
00:31:44,070 --> 00:31:46,640
You have no right to say no.

521
00:31:49,910 --> 00:31:50,870
How dare you!

522
00:32:30,750 --> 00:32:31,550
Dream.

523
00:32:33,830 --> 00:32:34,690
Zhao Yuanzhou!

524
00:32:37,990 --> 00:32:38,790
Protect.

525
00:32:57,140 --> 00:32:57,950
Dream.

526
00:33:15,060 --> 00:33:16,060
Do you like

527
00:33:16,640 --> 00:33:17,890
this meeting gift?

528
00:33:21,560 --> 00:33:22,930
Master!

529
00:33:23,640 --> 00:33:24,940
Master!

530
00:33:58,740 --> 00:34:00,740
Why is there blood on the flowers?

531
00:34:07,920 --> 00:34:10,060
Is it Master's blood?

532
00:34:24,860 --> 00:34:26,270
A mortal woman

533
00:34:26,560 --> 00:34:28,060
being so forward.

534
00:34:29,980 --> 00:34:31,510
My body feels weak.

535
00:34:31,909 --> 00:34:33,159
That's why I fell.

536
00:34:33,520 --> 00:34:35,520
Please don't take offense, my lord.

537
00:34:36,090 --> 00:34:37,420
You're not afraid of me?

538
00:34:38,139 --> 00:34:39,460
Why should I be afraid?

539
00:34:42,429 --> 00:34:43,630
I am a demon.

540
00:34:45,500 --> 00:34:46,770
I know.

541
00:34:47,190 --> 00:34:48,150
Great Demon,

542
00:34:48,190 --> 00:34:49,139
Zhu Yan.

543
00:34:52,820 --> 00:34:54,520
You look familiar.

544
00:34:55,840 --> 00:34:57,790
Have we met somewhere before?

545
00:34:59,370 --> 00:35:00,710
How cliché.

546
00:35:01,510 --> 00:35:02,830
Are you being serious?

547
00:35:05,290 --> 00:35:06,130
Hello.

548
00:35:07,010 --> 00:35:08,280
My name is Wen Xiao.

549
00:35:09,660 --> 00:35:10,500
Hello.

550
00:35:10,920 --> 00:35:12,320
My name is Zhao Yuanzhou.

551
00:35:15,040 --> 00:35:17,440
I didn't expect Mr. Zhu Yan to have an alias.

552
00:35:18,680 --> 00:35:20,790
Even a mere cunning rabbit has three burrows.

553
00:35:20,790 --> 00:35:22,000
As a great demon,

554
00:35:22,030 --> 00:35:23,160
having a few aliases

555
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:24,920
is nothing to brag about.

556
00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:26,830
Mr. Zhao Yuanzhou,

557
00:35:27,070 --> 00:35:28,670
my legs aren't weak anymore.

558
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:30,440
You can help me up now.

559
00:35:31,670 --> 00:35:32,510
Alright.

560
00:35:35,440 --> 00:35:36,110
Zhu Yan,

561
00:35:36,130 --> 00:35:37,080
let her go.

562
00:35:44,030 --> 00:35:45,030
Did you hear that?

563
00:35:45,030 --> 00:35:46,650
He wants you to let me go.

564
00:35:46,840 --> 00:35:47,800
No way.

565
00:35:49,980 --> 00:35:52,610
Even Mr. Zhuo's Cloud Light Sword couldn't kill me.

566
00:35:52,610 --> 00:35:54,240
Your little dagger—

567
00:35:58,710 --> 00:35:59,780
You won't die,

568
00:35:59,810 --> 00:36:01,150
but it will still hurt, won't it?

569
00:36:01,150 --> 00:36:02,840
Playing dirty, huh?

570
00:36:04,370 --> 00:36:05,820
Then I'll also—

571
00:36:11,470 --> 00:36:13,120
What did you put on the blade?

572
00:36:13,140 --> 00:36:14,400
A sedative for demons,

573
00:36:14,410 --> 00:36:15,530
Huanling Powder.

574
00:36:16,270 --> 00:36:17,280
Tit for tat.

575
00:36:17,850 --> 00:36:19,530
Your flower is beautiful.

576
00:36:19,640 --> 00:36:20,940
I'll take it.

577
00:36:27,270 --> 00:36:29,160
The Huanling Powder won't hold him for long.

578
00:36:29,160 --> 00:36:31,290
Quickly, lock him back in the dungeon.

579
00:36:33,480 --> 00:36:34,240
The dungeon

580
00:36:34,670 --> 00:36:35,740
can't hold him.

581
00:36:38,340 --> 00:36:40,370
He just escaped from there.

582
00:36:43,690 --> 00:36:44,510
Is that so?

583
00:36:50,160 --> 00:36:52,100
Then keep slashing him with the knife.

584
00:36:52,100 --> 00:36:52,990
No, no, no.

585
00:36:53,500 --> 00:36:54,360
Don't slash me.

586
00:36:54,830 --> 00:36:55,930
I'll go back myself.

587
00:36:55,930 --> 00:36:57,130
I promise I won't run.

588
00:36:57,530 --> 00:36:58,730
I'll go back on my own.

589
00:36:59,400 --> 00:37:00,330
Thank you.

590
00:37:04,730 --> 00:37:05,830
I can walk by myself.

591
00:37:05,830 --> 00:37:06,590
Thank you.

592
00:37:17,480 --> 00:37:18,350
Ms. Wen,

593
00:37:18,370 --> 00:37:20,040
here's the demon catalog you asked me to find.

594
00:37:20,040 --> 00:37:20,880
The information on Deceptive Beasts

595
00:37:20,880 --> 00:37:22,080
is all recorded here.

596
00:37:29,120 --> 00:37:30,360
You may go now.

597
00:37:30,380 --> 00:37:31,110
Ms. Wen,

598
00:37:31,220 --> 00:37:32,110
your wound...

599
00:37:32,250 --> 00:37:33,050
It's nothing.

600
00:38:05,790 --> 00:38:07,370
Fierce as a wrathful deity,

601
00:38:08,110 --> 00:38:09,350
engulfed in flames.

602
00:38:11,300 --> 00:38:13,220
Sir, this painting of Zhu Rong

603
00:38:13,250 --> 00:38:14,950
is so lifelike.

604
00:38:15,960 --> 00:38:17,580
My brushwork is ordinary.

605
00:38:18,490 --> 00:38:20,950
This painting excels in its vibrant colors.

606
00:38:23,910 --> 00:38:24,910
Good paint.

607
00:38:26,750 --> 00:38:28,790
It really is good paint.

608
00:38:31,930 --> 00:38:34,260
I heard they caught Zhu Yan.

609
00:38:34,760 --> 00:38:37,090
Zhu Yan is a great demon of the Wilderness.

610
00:38:37,490 --> 00:38:38,580
If he

611
00:38:39,150 --> 00:38:40,840
truly becomes our enemy...

612
00:38:42,440 --> 00:38:43,950
There's no need to worry.

613
00:38:44,750 --> 00:38:47,610
The Demon Hunting Bureau is just a pack of lost dogs.

614
00:38:47,630 --> 00:38:49,790
All I want is Zhao Yuanzhou.

615
00:38:50,240 --> 00:38:53,080
Since he's delivered himself to our doorstep,

616
00:38:53,860 --> 00:38:56,760
my grand plan, years in the making,

617
00:38:58,240 --> 00:39:01,180
can finally be brought to reality.

618

with a human face that speaks well,

621
00:39:12,330 --> 00:39:13,710
saying one thing but meaning another,

622
00:39:13,710 --> 00:39:15,070
speaking of evil but meaning good.

623
00:39:15,070 --> 00:39:16,630
Born as a Deceptive Beast,

624
00:39:16,650 --> 00:39:18,740
they are destined to speak against their will.

625
