1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
If you really want to make this create a killing phase call uhh?

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Although there is no serious reason for being a good value.

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Relax just wait.

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
The insane Clear Q is also not done.

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
The End

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:25,000
This time just use the Power you want.

7
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:30,000
I'm sorry, but I'm not sure if I should be able to do that.

8
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,000
I'm sorry, but I'm not sure if I should be able to do that.

9
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:40,000
I'm sorry, but I'm not sure if I should be able to do that.

10
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:45,000
I'm sorry, but I'm not sure if I should be able to do that.

11
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:50,000
I'm sorry, but I'm not sure if I should be able to do that.

12
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:55,000
I'm sorry, but I'm not sure if I should be able to do that.

13
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:00,000
I'm sorry, but I'm not sure if I should be able to do that.

14
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:05,000
I'm sorry, but I'm not sure if I should be able to do that.

15
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:10,000
I'm sorry, but I'm not sure if I should be able to do that.

16
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:15,000
I'm sorry, but I'm not sure if I should be able to do that.

17
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:20,000
I'm sorry, but I'm not sure if I should be able to do that.

18
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:25,000
I'm sorry, but I'm not sure if I should be able to do that.

19
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:30,000
I'm sorry, but I'm not sure if I should be able to do that.

20
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:35,000
I'm sorry, but I'm not sure if I should be able to do that.

21
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:40,000
I'm sorry, but I'm not sure if I should be able to do that.

22
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Oh, Lulie!

23
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,000
That's because Ying Lei believed you.

24
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,000
He didn't expect you to lie to him.

25
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Xiao Zhu, what on earth is going on?

26
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:06,000
He gave Ying Lei a empty box.

27
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:13,000
But, Li Lun wanted to be our Xiu Jian.

28
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:16,000
He will definitely come and rob Long Lin.

29
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Feng, you and Li Lun are so easy to deal with each other.

30
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,000
How could you prevent them from coming into our lives?

31
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:32,000
You're trying to prevent us from coming into our lives?

32
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:36,000
You're trying to prevent us from coming into our lives?

33
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:41,000
I thought you took Long Lin away because you didn't want Ying Lei to be in charge of it.

34
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
I was afraid that he would be guilty.

35
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:46,000
He was on fire and was in danger.

36
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
I was also in danger.

37
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:53,000
But your reaction was obviously to mislead us.

38
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Now, the unknowingly Ying Lei is chasing Ou Ying and is in danger for a empty box.

39
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Aren't you going to tell the truth?

40
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Xiao Qi.

41
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
My Lord.

42
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Stop.

43
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,000
I don't know if this half demon and half god's organs

44
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:36,000
will work better than human organs.

45
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:40,000
I indeed took Long Lin away.

46
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:47,000
You sacrificed Ying Lei to attract Li Lun and Ou Ying's attention.

47
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Then he's not guilty.

48
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:53,000
You want to kill Long Lin.

49
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Long Lin is useless to you. Why did you take him away?

50
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
I have my own purpose.

51
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,000
But I can't tell you now.

52
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Ying Lei is Ying Zhao's grandson.

53
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Li Lun and Ying Zhao are old friends who have known each other for years.

54
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
How will you deal with him?

55
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
I'm sorry.

56
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Let go of me.

57
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Let go of my grandson.

58
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Shut up.

59
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
If it wasn't for Ying Zhao,

60
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
I would have killed you.

61
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Xiao Qi.

62
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Close the door.

63
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
If you don't take Long Lin away,

64
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
I won't leave you there.

65
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
Xiao Qi, I'll save you.

66
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Let's go.

67
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:30,000
I heard that you took Long Lin away.

68
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
I heard that

69
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Lord Bai Yan took away Bai Ze Ling.

70
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
You know that?

71
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Bai Ze Ling is poisonous to the brain.

72
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Right?

73
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:53,000
You can be too ridiculous to lie to me.

74
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:00,000
I used the body of the god of the deep sea to burn Wen Xiao last night.

75
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
He is now

76
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
deeply poisonous.

77
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Yes.

78
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:22,000
So I left these days to find the pebbles

79
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:26,000
to see if they can purify Bai Ze Ling's poison.

80
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Wen Xiao is poisoned?

81
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:45,000
The poison is smeared on the wood.

82
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:48,000
It's colorless and hard to detect.

83
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:51,000
You use Bai Ze Ling to blow on wood every time.

84
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:55,000
It's so hard to detect.

85
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
The poison

86
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:01,000
is in my heart.

87
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:07,000
So you left Long Lin.

88
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Did you take the pebbles

89
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:16,000
and put them in the water?

90
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
Can the poison be cured?

91
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
It's hard.

92
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Lord Bai Yan,

93
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
why did you hide it from me?

94
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
You didn't tell me the truth.

95
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:35,000
He is afraid that I will save you with Long Lin.

96
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:38,000
And he won't come to repair the light sword.

97
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
He will save Bai Ji.

98
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Yes.

99
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:46,000
I hope to repair the light sword as soon as possible.

100
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:49,000
Lord Bai Yan, you are a god.

101
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
You are so selfish.

102
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
I can understand.

103
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
As a mother,

104
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:59,000
I don't want to see my son die.

105
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
I

106
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:04,000
give the medicine.

107
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:07,000
What's important in your eyes?

108
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
As a descendant of the clan,

109
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:16,000
I and the world

110
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:19,000
must choose the world.

111
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:23,000
Since Lord Bai Yan understands this,

112
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:26,000
why did you do the same thing?

113
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
If Wen Xiao dies,

114
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:31,000
there will be a new god of Bai Ze in the world.

115
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
Bai Ze Ling

116
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:37,000
will be reborn.

117
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:40,000
But if the divorce and Bai Ji's life are in harmony,

118
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:44,000
the two worlds will be in harmony.

119
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
The divorce and Bai Ji's life will be in harmony.

120
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
The divorce and Bai Ji's life will be in harmony.

121
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
But Bai Ji is different.

122
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:53,000
We Shenmu Yi clan has a life and death.

123
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
We have a death and death.

124
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:58,000
In addition to letting Wanwu to be resurrected,

125
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:01,000
we also have the ability to take the great enemy's life.

126
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:04,000
Letting Wanwu to be reborn.

127
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:07,000
Without the food, there is no country.

128
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:10,000
There is no way to live.

129
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:13,000
The world is in a mess.

130
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:16,000
You are right.

131
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:19,000
Can we trust you?

132
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:22,000
If you don't believe me,

133
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:25,000
you can ask other gods.

134
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:28,000
You can answer them.

135
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:32,000
The heaven says that

136
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
every god of Bai Ze

137
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:37,000
is dying for the sake of the world.

138
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:40,000
The fate has already been decided.

139
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:46,000
This is your point of view.

140
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
So,

141
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:59,000
it's not the medicine,

142
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:02,000
it's not Xiao Zhuor.

143
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:06,000
It's not Xiao Jiao.

144
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:12,000
It's me.

145
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
Voyage.

146
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,500
Lord.

147
00:10:29,500 --> 00:10:31,000
I did not use it.

148
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:34,000
I didn't grab the cuttlefish today.

149
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,800
Don't cry.

150
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:45,000
It's the third season of the Zhou-Yuan-Zhou-Jiao-Hua-San-Qi.

151
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,000
Are you afraid?

152
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,000
I'm not afraid.

153
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
I can die for you anytime.

154
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,000
I'm asking you.

155
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
Are you afraid that I'll die?

156
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,000
I'm afraid.

157
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,000
If he dies,

158
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,000
I'll die too.

159
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,000
I'll follow you forever.

160
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
When I was imprisoned,

161
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:51,000
I watched the scenes of Zhou-Zhao every day.

162
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,000
I was so angry.

163
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
I went out every day.

164
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
Although every time I die,

165
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:06,000
my life will be reduced to half.

166
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,000
But I still can't bear it.

167
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:15,000
Like a sweet poison,

168
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,000
I became a different person.

169
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:23,000
I felt a lot in their body.

170
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
There are many people in the world,

171
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
and the emotions flow.

172
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,000
The river is endless.

173
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
The mountain comes,

174
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
the water comes.

175
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,000
But now,

176
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:51,000
I still can't find my own body.

177
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,000
The blood of the Sang family

178
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,000
will also have a hidden lake.

179
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,000
The journey of the wind and snow.

180
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,000
I hope

181
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:12,000
you can find your own light.

182
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,000
But I...

183
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,000
When I come and go,

184
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,000
there is only here.

185
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,000
There is only here.

186
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
What a pity.

187
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,000
If I die,

188
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,000
I will be buried with someone.

189
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:54,000
I will also find the biggest stage.

190
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,000
Let's go.

191
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,000
Let's go.

192
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,000
Wait!

193
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,000
Wait!

194
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,000
I know you have met Bai Ze Ling.

195
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,000
You have worked hard.

196
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
But there are many people.

197
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,000
Every Bai Ze girl

198
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,000
is dying for the sake of saving the world.

199
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:03,000
Fate may have already been decided.

200
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:08,000
I believe you will make the right choice.

201
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,000
I will make the right choice.

202
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,000
I will make the right choice.

203
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,000
I will make the right choice.

204
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
I will make the right choice.

205
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,000
I will make the right choice.

206
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,000
I will make the right choice.

207
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,000
I will make the right choice.

208
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
I will make the right choice.

209
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,000
I will make the right choice.

210
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
I will make the right choice.

211
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,000
I will make the right choice.

212
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,000
I have not been alive for a few days.

213
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,000
It's just a small wound.

214
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,000
It's okay.

215
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,000
It is itchy and the venomous is strong.

216
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,000
I should do something to make it worse.

217
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:03,000
I heard that there is another Bai Ze in her body.

218
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,000
You're so silly.

219
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:17,000
How could you know the way to the White-Haired Man?

220
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,000
Even if it's one-thousandth of a thousand,

221
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,000
I won't give up.

222
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,000
You're getting weaker and weaker.

223
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,000
I don't want you to be affected.

224
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,000
I want you to live well.

225
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,000
You must live well.

226
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:47,000
I've thought about the end of everything.

227
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:52,000
But I never thought that the end would be decided.

228
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,000
I don't want to die.

229
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,000
I still have many things to do.

230
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,000
I didn't do it.

231
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,000
Don't regret it.

232
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,000
Don't you have the dragon's spirit to detoxify?

233
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,000
But there's only one dragon's spirit.

234
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,000
As a White-Haired Man,

235
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,000
I must make the right choice.

236
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,000
I'm a man of my word.

237
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:38,000
We're not the right choice to live.

238
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:44,000
You should ask yourself this.

239
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,000
I don't want to live,

240
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,000
but I can't give up.

241
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:57,000
You're so sincere about life.

242
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,000
But you must sacrifice.

243
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,000
It's unfair.

244
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:08,000
It turns out that God's destiny is not to die.

245
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,000
It's the price of saving the world.

246
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,000
I'm afraid of death,

247
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,000
but I can't make it.

248
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,000
I want to die with white glue.

249
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:29,000
I want all the creatures to die with me.

250
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:32,000
So, Bai Ze Lin

251
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,000
has always been the pure and pure man.

252
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:41,000
Only they can sacrifice for the world.

253
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,680
Don't let it slip,

254
00:19:08,680 --> 00:19:10,140
you waste bye bye.

255
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:13,080
Please trust me.

256
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:14,840
I must make it.

257
00:19:29,080 --> 00:19:30,000
Drinking the game is useless,

258
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,000
especially if she died.

259
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,000
I still feel pain.

260
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,000
Since Qi Yu is dead,

261
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:56,000
then

262
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:03,000
we still have the same relationship.

263
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:09,000
Life is full of complaints.

264
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:15,000
I've seen the world thousands of times.

265
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:19,000
That flower is a dream.

266
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,000
The song is the last one.

267
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:24,000
There are a few people who understand.

268
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:28,000
The long and short line.

269
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:31,000
How many years are still singing?

270
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:35,000
The balance of fate.

271
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,000
I will find a way.

272
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,000
I will find a way.

273
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:05,000
I've seen the master again.

274
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:08,000
What do you want me to do here?

275
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:13,000
You scared the Wenxiao family.

276
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:14,000
Right?

277
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,000
Yes.

278
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:23,000
I'll put the poison on the tomb.

279
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,000
If I eat it every time,

280
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,000
I'll be poisoned.

281
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,000
I'll be poisoned.

282
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:30,000
When I eat it,

283
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:33,000
I'll slowly enter his body.

284
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,000
The more I have power,

285
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:39,000
the more I'm poisoned.

286
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:43,000
I've put poison on the medicine I gave Baijiu.

287
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:46,000
So he's poisoned too.

288
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,000
What's your purpose?

289
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:55,000
I want the internal pill of Zhao Yuanzhou.

290
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:59,000
The internal pill of the killing brother and sister.

291
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:02,000
The name of the noble Bai Ze god daughter.

292
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,000
What's the reason?

293
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:12,000
The light is a magical weapon.

294
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,000
It's not a mortal.

295
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:17,000
It's hard to break the human body.

296
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:20,000
So in addition to the dragon spirit,

297
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:23,000
we need to remove the impurities in Zhao Yuanzhou's body.

298
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:26,000
So we can save the dragon spirit.

299
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:29,000
Take it.

300
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:33,000
Zhao Yuanzhou,

301
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:36,000
once you use the power of the impurities in your body,

302
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,000
it will make your internal pill damaged.

303
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,000
The medicine will be greatly reduced.

304
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:43,000
It's hard to recover in a short period of time.

305
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:47,000
My lord knows.

306
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:50,000
So before the medicine was recovered,

307
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:54,000
I'll have a lord Zhao Yuanzhou to protect me.

308
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:24,000
The power of the impurities in Zhao Yuanzhou is greatly reduced.

309
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:27,000
The medicine will be greatly reduced.

310
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:30,000
The medicine will be greatly reduced.

311
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:33,000
The medicine will be greatly reduced.

312
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:36,000
The medicine will be greatly reduced.

313
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:39,000
The medicine will be greatly reduced.

314
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:42,000
The medicine will be greatly reduced.

315
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:45,000
The medicine will be greatly reduced.

316
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:48,000
The medicine will be greatly reduced.

317
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:52,000
The medicine will be greatly reduced.

318
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:55,000
The medicine will be greatly reduced.

319
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:58,000
The medicine will be greatly reduced.

320
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:01,000
The medicine will be greatly reduced.

321
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:04,000
The medicine will be greatly reduced.

322
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:07,000
The medicine will be greatly reduced.

323
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:10,000
The medicine will be greatly reduced.

324
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:13,000
The medicine will be greatly reduced.

325
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:16,000
The medicine will be greatly reduced.

326
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:19,000
My lord.

327
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:26,000
In the future, we will be together to protect the Great Emperor and the human world.

328
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:31,000
Promise me.

329
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:36,000
I'll give you the medicine

330
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:39,000
that will be given to Zhao Yuanzhou.

331
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:49,000
Stop.

332
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,000
Didn't you say

333
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:14,000
that you will give the medicine at the age of tens of thousands of years?

334
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:20,000
God is like a god.

335
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:25,000
You will not die with the medicine.

336
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:31,000
You promised not to force it.

337
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:49,000
I will give you the medicine.

338
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:52,000
I will give you the medicine.

339
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:55,000
I will give you the medicine.

340
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:58,000
I will give you the medicine.

341
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:01,000
I will give you the medicine.

342
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:04,000
I will give you the medicine.

343
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:07,000
I will give you the medicine.

344
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:10,000
I will give you the medicine.

345
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:13,000
I will give you the medicine.

346
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:16,000
My lord.

347
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:23,000
My lord.

348
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:25,000
Do you know me?

349
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:31,000
How can you only pour yourself a cup?

350
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:34,000
I have never heard of the patient who still needs to drink.

351
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:38,000
Mother, don't be so sad.

352
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:42,000
Let me help you to make a living.

353
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:45,000
I want to exchange some jade cakes.

354
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:49,000
You can say you don't want to drink.

355
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:51,000
I will listen to you.

356
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:15,000
I have known you for so long.

357
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:18,000
I have never had the chance to drink with you.

358
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:22,000
I almost had the chance.

359
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:24,000
When?

360
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:27,000
You were in the air.

361
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:30,000
You locked yourself in the little garden.

362
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:32,000
I want to go to the city.

363
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:34,000
I want to go to the city.

364
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:36,000
I want to go to the city.

365
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:38,000
I want to go to the city.

366
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:40,000
I want to go to the city.

367
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:42,000
The future is expensive.

368
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:45,000
I will be able to go to the city to get the medicine.

369
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:49,000
Long only has mechanism?

370
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:52,000
Because I am leaving under the seriae.

371
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:55,000
Can have a meal.

372
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:58,000
I want to risk being on my way.

373
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:02,000
You won't get a farklı bark?

374
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:06,000
No!

375
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:08,000
Don't worry about it.

376
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:10,000
This cup

377
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:13,000
is the only one we can drink together

378
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:15,000
with great hatred.

379
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:18,000
Once,

380
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:21,000
we were indeed blood-sucking.

381
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:23,000
Once?

382
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:26,000
Once.

383
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:32,000
I once

384
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:35,000
hated you so much.

385
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:40,000
So even though I knew you were controlled by force,

386
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:43,000
I still couldn't forgive you.

387
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:47,000
Later,

388
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:50,000
I became a demon

389
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:53,000
and finally understood

390
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:59,000
what was the meaning of it.

391
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:07,000
You have hatred for me.

392
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:11,000
You have grudge for me.

393
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:17,000
You have grudge for me.

394
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:23,000
I have grudge for you

395
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:27,000
and I have grudge for you.

396
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:38,000
I have grudge for you.

397
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:44,000
I have grudge for you.

398
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:50,000
However,

399
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:55,000
I chose to become your friend.

400
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:01,000
This is all

401
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:04,000
you need to mention.

402
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:08,000
You have grudge for me.

403
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:10,000
I've grudge for you.

404
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:12,000
I'm sorry.

405
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:15,000
I'm sorry.

406
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:18,000
I'm sorry.

407
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:23,000
You're so cruel.

408
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:26,000
I'm sorry.

409
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:31,000
I see.

410
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:33,000
I'm sorry.

411
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:35,000
I'm sorry.

412
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:37,600
the ice?",

413
00:30:38,360 --> 00:30:39,800
Water lamp.

414
00:30:47,740 --> 00:30:49,220
On the first glass

415
00:30:50,760 --> 00:30:52,680
of tea,

416
00:30:53,620 --> 00:30:55,800
you helped me get to beta to

417
00:30:55,800 --> 00:30:57,620
get Saints IQ and

418
00:30:57,620 --> 00:30:58,800
saved me the whole life.

419
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:08,000
Who should steal the evangelical exam

420
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:09,000
?

421
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:11,000
I will see if we can find him anyway.

422
00:31:11,040 --> 00:31:12,040
Hey!

423
00:31:12,040 --> 00:31:14,040
That's great.

424
00:31:18,040 --> 00:31:22,040
So that you can do it along with the exam,

425
00:31:22,040 --> 00:31:24,040
I'll do it the way.

426
00:31:24,220 --> 00:31:26,200
Get out.

427
00:31:28,040 --> 00:31:30,040
Bro,

428
00:31:30,080 --> 00:31:32,080
I'll ask the roots to unobserved.

429
00:31:33,060 --> 00:31:35,080
Stop crying political tyranny

430
00:31:36,060 --> 00:31:39,320
I thank you for what you have done well,

431
00:31:39,540 --> 00:31:41,440
For doing so,

432
00:31:42,220 --> 00:31:45,000
For me in the space beckoning to the stars

433
00:32:05,080 --> 00:32:08,740
Misery is like dream

434
00:32:09,620 --> 00:32:13,240
Sense of need껍

435
00:32:13,720 --> 00:32:16,480
The happys, when this dead end

436
00:32:17,100 --> 00:32:19,840
One is missing

437
00:32:20,160 --> 00:32:26,140
This is what i'm writing

438
00:32:26,140 --> 00:32:28,140
Be careful, save Mingzhen.

439
00:32:35,140 --> 00:32:36,140
Save Mingzhen.

440
00:32:57,140 --> 00:32:58,140
It's not me.

441
00:33:00,140 --> 00:33:01,140
It's Wenxiao.

442
00:33:03,140 --> 00:33:04,140
I'm sorry.

443
00:33:05,140 --> 00:33:06,140
To save her,

444
00:33:08,140 --> 00:33:12,140
I still have to do this.

445
00:33:15,140 --> 00:33:17,140
Is there only one way?

446
00:33:26,140 --> 00:33:29,620
Dajun

447
00:33:39,140 --> 00:33:40,140
Dajun

448
00:33:56,140 --> 00:33:59,620
Lovely

449
00:34:00,280 --> 00:34:14,020
Narrow thoughts

450
00:34:14,180 --> 00:34:14,860
Captain

451
00:34:16,820 --> 00:34:17,940
Flow

452
00:34:20,100 --> 00:34:22,640
Why are you two washing clothes together

453
00:34:23,160 --> 00:34:23,940
Don't worry

454
00:34:23,940 --> 00:34:24,940
I'm fine.

455
00:34:27,260 --> 00:34:28,900
When did I get so stubborn?

456
00:34:30,660 --> 00:34:31,620
He's not stubborn.

457
00:34:36,100 --> 00:34:37,100
It's true.

458
00:34:38,420 --> 00:34:39,900
I was very shy just now.

459
00:34:41,540 --> 00:34:42,500
But luckily,

460
00:34:45,780 --> 00:34:47,300
I made it.

461
00:34:54,900 --> 00:34:55,900
What is this?

462
00:34:58,500 --> 00:34:59,500
The Wukong Wood.

463
00:35:05,860 --> 00:35:06,980
The disease has been cured.

464
00:35:07,380 --> 00:35:08,540
It's been spread all over India.

465
00:35:09,740 --> 00:35:11,300
Since it can break the spirit,

466
00:35:11,940 --> 00:35:14,420
it might break the Wukong Wood inside me.

467
00:35:15,700 --> 00:35:17,580
So we tried it together.

468
00:35:18,900 --> 00:35:20,620
Is this something that can be tried?

469
00:35:22,420 --> 00:35:23,420
I'm not sure.

470
00:35:24,740 --> 00:35:26,660
I'm just kidding.

471
00:35:29,380 --> 00:35:31,340
Actually, it's still 5 points.

472
00:35:37,180 --> 00:35:38,180
3 points.

473
00:35:43,580 --> 00:35:44,740
You two are sick.

474
00:35:46,060 --> 00:35:47,260
I was wrong.

475
00:35:47,700 --> 00:35:48,380
What about you?

476
00:35:50,300 --> 00:35:51,100
I was wrong.

477
00:35:54,220 --> 00:35:55,380
5 station.

478
00:35:59,020 --> 00:36:00,260
Let me treat you to a meal.

479
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:01,440
Come on.

480
00:36:03,580 --> 00:36:04,940
Apologies.

481
00:36:06,380 --> 00:36:07,780
Rem geometry?

482
00:36:08,660 --> 00:36:09,660
It's okay.

483
00:36:10,860 --> 00:36:11,880
For me.

484
00:36:12,380 --> 00:36:14,600
Don't get upset anymore.

485
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:16,660
As long as I can save you,

486
00:36:18,060 --> 00:36:19,620
even one means possible.

487
00:36:20,060 --> 00:36:21,180
I do want it.

488
00:36:23,940 --> 00:36:24,680
Ok

489
00:36:29,400 --> 00:36:31,540
The internal Handscape Yu Mian's will

490
00:36:32,460 --> 00:36:34,980
I want to get the UnС recycledlass

491
00:36:35,900 --> 00:36:38,480
Remove the reusable gold

492
00:36:38,480 --> 00:36:41,560
The shelf's hard inside

493
00:36:42,600 --> 00:36:44,040
Lift the neck

494
00:36:46,040 --> 00:36:47,120
After removing the long neck

495
00:36:47,120 --> 00:36:51,920
The upper side needs to Poland

496
00:36:51,920 --> 00:36:52,400
Mom.

497
00:37:08,520 --> 00:37:09,680
Mu Jin Mo again.

498
00:37:12,040 --> 00:37:12,800
reliever pills.

499
00:37:19,040 --> 00:37:20,320
Where's your gift with Mu Jin Mo?

500
00:37:20,320 --> 00:37:22,320
I'll give you the antidote.

501
00:37:35,320 --> 00:37:36,320
Retreat.

502
00:37:37,320 --> 00:37:38,320
Retreat!

503
00:37:50,320 --> 00:37:51,320
Retreat.

504
00:38:20,320 --> 00:38:21,320
Retreat.

505
00:38:30,320 --> 00:38:31,320
Teacher.

506
00:38:51,320 --> 00:38:55,320
I don't believe it.

507
00:38:58,320 --> 00:38:59,320
I don't believe it.

508
00:39:00,320 --> 00:39:03,320
I'll take it back to my home.

509
00:39:08,320 --> 00:39:09,320
Don't touch it.

510
00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:22,320
Retreat.

511
00:39:51,320 --> 00:39:52,320
I didn't expect

512
00:39:53,320 --> 00:39:55,320
he would reach such a high point

513
00:39:56,320 --> 00:39:59,320
for the unending obsession.

514
00:40:14,320 --> 00:40:15,320
Where's the antidote?

515
00:40:20,320 --> 00:40:21,320
Give me the antidote.

516
00:40:24,320 --> 00:40:26,320
I don't have the antidote.

517
00:40:29,320 --> 00:40:31,320
I'm a big fool.

518
00:40:32,320 --> 00:40:33,320
I want to see

519
00:40:34,320 --> 00:40:37,320
if someone would use their own power

520
00:40:37,320 --> 00:40:39,320
to put poison on their body.

521
00:40:50,320 --> 00:40:51,320
Retreat.

522
00:41:15,320 --> 00:41:16,320
My Lady.

523
00:41:17,320 --> 00:41:18,320
My Lady.

524
00:41:21,320 --> 00:41:22,320
My Lady.

525
00:41:24,320 --> 00:41:25,320
He's not looking for the antidote.

526
00:41:28,320 --> 00:41:29,320
What are you doing here?

527
00:41:31,320 --> 00:41:32,320
I'm here to follow you.

528
00:41:33,320 --> 00:41:35,320
I don't want to be left behind.

529
00:41:38,320 --> 00:41:39,320
My Lady.

530
00:41:51,320 --> 00:41:52,320
I'll let you see

531
00:41:53,320 --> 00:41:55,320
my true face

532
00:41:56,320 --> 00:41:58,320
in the last moment.

533
00:42:00,320 --> 00:42:01,320
Let me go.

534
00:42:02,320 --> 00:42:03,320
No.

535
00:42:10,320 --> 00:42:11,320
What are you doing?

536
00:42:12,320 --> 00:42:13,320
I'll give you the antidote.

537
00:42:16,320 --> 00:42:17,320
I didn't expect

538
00:42:17,320 --> 00:42:20,320
he would be so loyal.

539
00:42:21,320 --> 00:42:22,320
No.

540
00:42:23,320 --> 00:42:24,320
He's not loyal.

541
00:42:25,320 --> 00:42:27,320
He's looking at the eyes of the spirit.

542
00:42:28,320 --> 00:42:30,320
He's not looking at the master.

543
00:42:33,320 --> 00:42:35,320
I don't want you to get hurt.

544
00:42:36,320 --> 00:42:38,320
I don't need you to do this to me.

545
00:42:48,320 --> 00:42:49,320
My Lady.

546
00:43:05,320 --> 00:43:06,320
My Lady.

547
00:43:08,320 --> 00:43:10,320
I finally saved you.

548
00:43:10,320 --> 00:43:11,320
I saved you.

549
00:43:16,320 --> 00:43:18,320
If you hadn't saved me from the old age,

550
00:43:19,320 --> 00:43:21,320
I would have died long ago.

551
00:43:26,320 --> 00:43:27,320
Now,

552
00:43:29,320 --> 00:43:32,320
I'm the one who's going to give you the antidote.

553
00:43:35,320 --> 00:43:36,320
You never cut me off.

554
00:43:36,320 --> 00:43:37,320
I'll cut you off.

555
00:43:39,320 --> 00:43:40,320
Then,

556
00:43:46,320 --> 00:43:47,320
promise me one thing.

557
00:43:48,320 --> 00:43:49,320
You say it.

558
00:43:52,320 --> 00:43:54,320
I can't

559
00:43:55,320 --> 00:43:57,320
become someone else.

560
00:44:01,320 --> 00:44:03,320
I hope you can understand.

561
00:44:07,320 --> 00:44:08,320
The real me.

562
00:44:19,320 --> 00:44:20,320
Follow me.

563
00:44:22,320 --> 00:44:24,320
I'll take you to the Great Wall.

564
00:44:28,320 --> 00:44:29,320
Are you afraid?

565
00:44:30,320 --> 00:44:31,320
I'm not afraid.

566
00:44:32,320 --> 00:44:34,320
I'll die for you.

567
00:44:34,320 --> 00:44:36,320
If you die,

568
00:44:37,320 --> 00:44:38,320
I'll die for you.

569
00:44:40,320 --> 00:44:42,320
I'll follow you forever.

570
00:45:05,320 --> 00:45:07,320
I sing the last song.

571
00:45:07,320 --> 00:45:09,320
How many people have heard it?

572
00:45:10,320 --> 00:45:13,320
The warm and warm song.

573
00:45:14,320 --> 00:45:16,320
How many years are still singing?

574
00:45:17,320 --> 00:45:20,320
The balance of fate.

575
00:45:22,320 --> 00:45:24,320
Don't forget me.

576
00:45:24,320 --> 00:45:28,320
I'm going to cut you off.

577
00:45:34,320 --> 00:45:36,320

But I'm happy.

590
00:46:20,320 --> 00:46:22,320
I'm worried that you'll get hurt.

591
00:46:22,320 --> 00:46:24,320
I'm worried that you'll get hurt.

592
