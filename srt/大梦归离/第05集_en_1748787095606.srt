1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,100
Interpol

2
00:00:06,100 --> 00:00:10,920
See ya, buddy!

3
00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:16,100
I was drunk and came in at a young age.

4
00:00:16,100 --> 00:00:29,560
And to learn the super-awkward dions of the Depala , after the break of BLUE, I create new scaffolds for you and I devote super-awkward-dions to you my dear.

5
00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:04,560
I'm sorry, but I'm not sure if I should be able to do that.

6
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:09,560
I'm sorry, but I'm not sure if I should be able to do that.

7
00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:14,560
I'm sorry, but I'm not sure if I should be able to do that.

8
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:19,560
I'm sorry, but I'm not sure if I should be able to do that.

9
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:24,560
I'm sorry, but I'm not sure if I should be able to do that.

10
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:29,560
I'm sorry, but I'm not sure if I should be able to do that.

11
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:34,560
I'm sorry, but I'm not sure if I should be able to do that.

12
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:39,560
I'm sorry, but I'm not sure if I should be able to do that.

13
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:27,560
Sister.

14
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:32,560
Why did you kill me?

15
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:42,560
Sister.

16
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:45,560
You've wrongly blamed me.

17
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:49,560
Brother.

18
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:52,560
You have nothing to say.

19
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:56,560
Don't blame me.

20
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:24,560
Sister.

21
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:38,560
You dare to come again?

22
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:41,560
If I don't come, they'll be in danger.

23
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:43,560
Because you and Ran Yi colluded,

24
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:46,560
that's why they'll be in danger.

25
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:48,560
Collusion?

26
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:51,560
Master Xiao Shuo's words are really hard to hear.

27
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:53,560
I and Ran Yi always work together.

28
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:55,560
We all need each other.

29
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:57,560
When you came to the Jiao Temple,

30
00:03:57,560 --> 00:03:59,560
you said you wanted to work with us.

31
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:02,560
What's the truth in your mouth?

32
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:04,560
What's the truth?

33
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:07,560
What Master Xiao Shuo said is true.

34
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:09,560
I'm just a little girl.

35
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:12,560
You're trying to withdraw?

36
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:16,560
You...

37
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:19,560
I can talk to you slowly,

38
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:23,560
but I can't come back if I don't save them.

39
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:53,560
How can you deal with Ran Yi?

40
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:56,560
There's a simple way.

41
00:04:57,560 --> 00:05:01,560
Let the dreamer die in your dream.

42
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:02,560
So hard?

43
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:04,560
Just commit suicide.

44
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:06,560
It's simple,

45
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:09,560
but not everyone can commit suicide.

46
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:12,560
Do you know how to commit suicide?

47
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:13,560
How could I?

48
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:16,560
I'm not in Ran Yi's dream.

49
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:18,560
Are you sure?

50
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:21,560
How can you be sure?

51
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:25,560
divination

52
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:46,560
It seems you really understand.

53
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:48,560
If there's something,

54
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:54,440
but maybe there is nothing to tell me than my dreams.

55
00:06:11,460 --> 00:06:13,120
Helen Pearl hanging from a striped해쒳,

56
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:14,660
not broken stably,

57
00:06:15,060 --> 00:06:16,760
she must break all the other weapons,

58
00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:20,000
The comunidad is just each beautifulときのそうひと percent.

59
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:25,000
I'm not sure if I can get the key to the door.

60
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:30,000
I'm not sure if I can get the key to the door.

61
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:35,000
I'm not sure if I can get the key to the door.

62
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:40,000
I'm not sure if I can get the key to the door.

63
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:45,000
I'm not sure if I can get the key to the door.

64
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:50,000
I'm not sure if I can get the key to the door.

65
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:55,000
I'm not sure if I can get the key to the door.

66
00:06:55,000 --> 00:07:00,000
I'm not sure if I can get the key to the door.

67
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:05,000
I'm not sure if I can get the key to the door.

68
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:10,000
I'm not sure if I can get the key to the door.

69
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:15,000
I'm not sure if I can get the key to the door.

70
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:20,000
I'm not sure if I can get the key to the door.

71
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:25,000
I'm not sure if I can get the key to the door.

72
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:30,000
I'm not sure if I can get the key to the door.

73
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:35,000
I'm not sure if I can get the key to the door.

74
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:40,000
I'm not sure if I can get the key to the door.

75
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:45,000
I'm not sure if I can get the key to the door.

76
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:50,000
I'm not sure if I can get the key to the door.

77
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:55,000
I'm not sure if I can get the key to the door.

78
00:07:55,000 --> 00:08:00,000
I'm not sure if I can get the key to the door.

79
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:05,000
I don't know why I can't hear the key to the door.

80
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:18,000
Forget it. I'll go look for it.

81
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
Don't worry.

82
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
The food is not cold.

83
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
The gold and the water are not cold.

84
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
Everything is in the dream.

85
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
Just wake up.

86
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
Then how can I wake up?

87
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
If you want to wake up,

88
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
then you can.

89
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
I don't want to wake up.

90
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
I don't want to wake up.

91
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
I don't want to wake up.

92
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
I don't want to wake up.

93
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
I don't want to wake up.

94
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
Just now

95
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,920
Should we save ourselves?

96
00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:51,440
Hey,ausaust chair,

97
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:54,360
be there.

98
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
Lord Pei.

99
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
What's going on?

100
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:09,000
This is the reaction of the one who has been suffering from the dream.

101
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:13,000
The person who has been in the dream has the deepest thought in the dream.

102
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:17,000
The deeper the wound, the more serious the wound will be.

103
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:22,000
Then why haven't I been affected?

104
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
My obsession.

105
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
It's true that you're very good.

106
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:32,000
Even Lord Pei who has been in the dream has been suffering from the dream.

107
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
You have been weak all along.

108
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
This time, you will be fine.

109
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:46,000
Chuan, we should have a good talk.

110
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
You should talk about someone who doesn't belong to me.

111
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
It's Ranyi.

112
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
He is indeed here.

113
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,000
Don't waste my time.

114
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,000
Let's hurry and find him.

115
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,000
Lord Pei.

116
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,000
What's wrong?

117
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,000
I'll take you to see Ranyi.

118
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,000
But Lord Pei, don't go up the wall.

119
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,000
Just stay here.

120
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,000
Don't talk about it anymore.

121
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
I don't trust them following you.

122
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:29,000
Who knows if you will lead them to the limit again.

123
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
I left the dream a long time ago.

124
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,000
My father would always be at my hands.

125
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:55,000
He said that if he would hold on to this word,

126
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
he would break the bad dream.

127
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,000
Don't worry.

128
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,000
I can deal with the drug.

129
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,000
It won't be a problem.

130
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
Have you ever had a nightmare?

131
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:25,000
This drug is written by Xiaoqiao.

132
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:29,000
Your father should be helpful to you.

133
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,000
Thank you.

134
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,000
Thank you.

135
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,000
Fine.

136
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,000
You can help each other.

137
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,000
We are brothers.

138
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,000
Just play this game.

139
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,000
I'll lose to you.

140
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,000
This sister is very safe.

141
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:20,000
There are more words and drugs than words.

142
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,000
You...

143
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,000
Let's go.

144
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,000
I'm sorry.

145
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,000
I'm sorry.

146
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,000
I'm sorry.

147
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,000
I'm sorry.

148
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,000
I'm sorry.

149
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,000
I'm sorry.

150
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,000
I'm sorry.

151
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,000
I'm sorry.

152
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,000
I'm sorry.

153
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,000
I'm sorry.

154
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,000
I'm sorry.

155
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,000
I'm sorry.

156
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,000
I'm sorry.

157
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,000
I'm sorry.

158
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,000
I'm sorry.

159
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,000
I'm sorry.

160
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,000
I'm sorry.

161
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,000
I'm sorry.

162
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,000
I'm sorry.

163
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,000
I'm sorry.

164
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,000
I'm sorry.

165
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,000
I'm sorry.

166
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,000
I'm sorry.

167
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,000
I'm sorry.

168
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,000
I'm sorry.

169
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,000
I'm sorry.

170
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,000
I'm sorry.

171
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,000
I'm sorry.

172
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,000
I'm sorry.

173
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,000
I'm sorry.

174
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,000
I'm sorry.

175
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,000
I'm sorry.

176
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,000
I'm sorry.

177
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,000
I'm sorry.

178
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,000
I'm sorry.

179
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,000
I'm sorry.

180
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,000
I'm sorry.

181
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,000
I'm sorry.

182
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,000
I'm sorry.

183
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,000
I'm sorry.

184
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,000
I'm sorry.

185
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,000
I'm sorry.

186
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,000
I'm sorry.

187
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,000
I'm sorry.

188
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,000
I'm sorry.

189
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,000
I'm sorry.

190
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,000
I'm sorry.

191
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,000
I'm sorry.

192
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,000
I'm sorry.

193
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,000
I'm sorry.

194
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,000
I'm sorry.

195
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,000
I'm sorry.

196
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,000
I'm sorry.

197
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,000
I'm sorry.

198
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,000
I'm sorry.

199
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,000
I'm sorry.

200
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,000
I'm sorry.

201
00:15:39,460 --> 00:15:40,760
I'm sorry.

202
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,240
I'm sorry.

203
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,480
I'm sorry.

204
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:46,500
I'm sorry.

205
00:15:47,500 --> 00:15:48,500
I'm sorry.

206
00:15:49,500 --> 00:15:50,320
I'm sorry.

207
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:51,340
I'm sorry.

208
00:15:56,460 --> 00:15:57,700
Yunkuang chop.

209
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,000
Since the 17th century,

210
00:16:03,500 --> 00:16:05,500
I did not replace her at all.

211
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,500
For the past ten years

212
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:09,500
He saved me.

213
00:16:11,500 --> 00:16:13,500
He was your brother.

214
00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:16,500
But the silver sword he got from me

215
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:18,500
was not as powerful as yours.

216
00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:23,500
He told me that he had a brother who loved him.

217
00:16:23,500 --> 00:16:26,500
He was also disturbed by the nightmare.

218
00:16:26,500 --> 00:16:29,500
He asked me if I had any way.

219
00:16:29,500 --> 00:16:32,500
I gave him a piece of my jade.

220
00:16:32,500 --> 00:16:35,500
He asked him to take it back to the Demon City to use it.

221
00:16:35,500 --> 00:16:39,500
Then his brother was no longer disturbed by the nightmare.

222
00:16:39,500 --> 00:16:42,500
He was no longer afraid.

223
00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:47,500
Brother, I dare not sleep.

224
00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:52,500
When I fell asleep, I dreamed of myself becoming a monster.

225
00:16:53,500 --> 00:16:56,500
Everyone was not fun.

226
00:16:57,500 --> 00:16:59,500
It's okay.

227
00:16:59,500 --> 00:17:02,500
I was annoying.

228
00:17:06,500 --> 00:17:08,500
I have a brother.

229
00:17:08,500 --> 00:17:10,500
Don't be afraid.

230
00:17:35,500 --> 00:17:40,500
Every night, you are still in the old place.

231
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:43,500
I'm afraid that I will...

232
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:49,500
So it is.

233
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:53,500
That's why Xiao Zhuang didn't dream for so many years.

234
00:17:53,500 --> 00:17:55,500
It's this.

235
00:18:05,500 --> 00:18:08,500
You have a good brother.

236
00:18:09,500 --> 00:18:11,500
It's a pity.

237
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:15,500
Kill him for me.

238
00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:23,500
My brother didn't let me dream.

239
00:18:24,500 --> 00:18:26,500
Just wait and see.

240
00:18:26,500 --> 00:18:28,500
Kill them.

241
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:32,500
Let me live in the nightmare for so many years.

242
00:18:32,500 --> 00:18:37,500
One day, you will wake up from the nightmare.

243
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:49,500
But you know it's not today.

244
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:51,500
It's not now.

245
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:56,500
Then tell me.

246
00:18:56,500 --> 00:18:59,500
Why did you help me?

247
00:19:00,500 --> 00:19:02,500
It's interesting.

248
00:19:05,500 --> 00:19:08,500
You are helping each other.

249
00:19:08,500 --> 00:19:10,500
You are called the beauty.

250
00:19:10,500 --> 00:19:12,500
And we are the demons.

251
00:19:12,500 --> 00:19:15,500
We need a reason.

252
00:19:15,500 --> 00:19:21,500
You are not hurt, but you can always think of the excuse to face the emperor.

253
00:19:21,500 --> 00:19:25,500
Zhao Yuanzhong, I have told you.

254
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:29,500
No one and demons can get along well.

255
00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:33,500
Really?

256
00:19:33,500 --> 00:19:37,500
Then why did you insist on being with Miss Qi?

257
00:19:42,500 --> 00:19:45,500
I just want to ask you if you are smart.

258
00:19:45,500 --> 00:19:47,500
I can't keep it from you.

259
00:19:47,500 --> 00:19:49,500
Where is Miss Qi?

260
00:19:50,500 --> 00:19:53,500
My daughter is too ill-tempered.

261
00:19:53,500 --> 00:19:55,500
She can't see the outside world.

262
00:20:20,500 --> 00:20:22,500
Miss.

263
00:20:22,500 --> 00:20:48,500
.

264
00:20:48,500 --> 00:20:49,500
Why?

265
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,500
Why did you save me?

266
00:20:54,500 --> 00:20:56,500
Why didn't you let me die?

267
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:00,500
It's easy to die,

268
00:21:01,500 --> 00:21:03,500
but it can't solve any problem.

269
00:21:04,500 --> 00:21:07,500
Only the person who cares about you is sad.

270
00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:09,500
I'm busy, but I'm not.

271
00:21:11,500 --> 00:21:13,500
I'm in the human world.

272
00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:18,500
I'm with Miao Miao.

273
00:21:19,500 --> 00:21:21,500
I'm a little bit lonely.

274
00:21:22,500 --> 00:21:24,500
I'm a little bit lonely.

275
00:21:26,500 --> 00:21:28,500
I'm a little bit lonely.

276
00:21:30,500 --> 00:21:32,500
I'm a little bit lonely.

277
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:35,500
I'm a little bit lonely.

278
00:21:37,500 --> 00:21:39,500
I'm a little bit lonely.

279
00:21:49,500 --> 00:21:52,500
The only person who cares about me is dead.

280
00:21:52,500 --> 00:21:54,500
Why am I alive?

281
00:21:55,500 --> 00:21:57,500
Shanyi Yu.

282
00:21:58,500 --> 00:22:02,500
Did you say that she is Shanyi?

283
00:22:04,500 --> 00:22:06,500
You know her?

284
00:22:08,500 --> 00:22:10,500
She is still alive.

285
00:22:14,500 --> 00:22:16,500
We can take you to see her.

286
00:22:18,500 --> 00:22:20,500
Since you put her in the bag...

287
00:22:20,500 --> 00:22:21,500
It's not Miss Qi.

288
00:22:22,500 --> 00:22:23,500
It's Master Qi.

289
00:22:27,500 --> 00:22:28,500
We just caught her.

290
00:22:28,500 --> 00:22:30,500
We haven't got a chance to ask her.

291
00:22:31,500 --> 00:22:33,500
She is still in Ranyi's dream.

292
00:22:33,500 --> 00:22:35,500
This is her retribution.

293
00:22:36,500 --> 00:22:38,500
She will never wake up.

294
00:22:39,500 --> 00:22:41,500
Master Qi is guilty.

295
00:22:42,500 --> 00:22:45,500
But she should be punished by the devil.

296
00:22:45,500 --> 00:22:48,500
It's not because of the evil spirit that she is doing this.

297
00:22:49,500 --> 00:22:50,500
What?

298
00:22:51,500 --> 00:22:53,500
When she was a demon,

299
00:22:53,500 --> 00:22:55,500
she was doing this when she was crying and crying.

300
00:22:55,500 --> 00:22:58,500
She was doing this when she was crying and crying.

301
00:22:59,500 --> 00:23:01,500
Why didn't you say that?

302
00:23:01,500 --> 00:23:03,500
Why is it so ugly?

303
00:23:09,500 --> 00:23:13,500
This is the chance to punish the devil.

304
00:23:24,500 --> 00:23:26,500
I really have to say it.

305
00:23:27,500 --> 00:23:29,500
I really have to say it.

306
00:23:31,500 --> 00:23:33,500
The gun of Jiao Long is also broken.

307
00:23:33,500 --> 00:23:35,500
It's a water gun.

308
00:23:35,500 --> 00:23:37,500
It's dry.

309
00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:42,500
It can kill the water tribe.

310
00:23:51,500 --> 00:23:54,500
I promised Miss Qi to take her to the palace.

311
00:23:54,500 --> 00:23:56,500
I will kill her.

312
00:23:56,500 --> 00:23:58,500
I will kill her.

313
00:24:01,500 --> 00:24:03,500
The world is so busy.

314
00:24:04,500 --> 00:24:06,500
There is no road to go.

315
00:24:09,500 --> 00:24:13,500
But in the world,

316
00:24:25,500 --> 00:24:29,500
There is only love and faith.

317
00:24:29,500 --> 00:24:32,500
It will only be fair.

318
00:24:34,500 --> 00:24:36,500
I mean it.

319
00:24:36,500 --> 00:24:38,500
I did that alone.

320
00:24:40,500 --> 00:24:43,500
I think if I know的時候.

321
00:24:44,500 --> 00:24:46,500
It will be a long time.

322
00:24:48,500 --> 00:24:50,500
It will be as the river passes.

323
00:24:50,500 --> 00:24:52,500
I will not run anyway.

324
00:24:52,500 --> 00:24:54,500
I'm waiting for the sun

325
00:24:54,500 --> 00:24:56,500
I'm holding my heart

326
00:24:56,500 --> 00:24:58,500
I'm thinking about you

327
00:24:58,500 --> 00:25:00,500
The dream is so strong

328
00:25:00,500 --> 00:25:02,500
I'm falling into the boat

329
00:25:02,500 --> 00:25:06,500
But I'm not hurt

330
00:25:08,500 --> 00:25:10,500
I've been through everything

331
00:25:10,500 --> 00:25:12,500
I've been through every obstacle

332
00:25:12,500 --> 00:25:16,500
I've been through all the hardships

333
00:25:16,500 --> 00:25:18,500
I've seen the world

334
00:25:18,500 --> 00:25:22,500
I've seen the flowers

335
00:25:22,500 --> 00:25:26,500
I've seen the rain

336
00:25:26,500 --> 00:25:28,500
I've sung the songs

337
00:25:28,500 --> 00:25:31,500
How many people have heard of me

338
00:25:31,500 --> 00:25:35,500
The warm and warm song

339
00:25:35,500 --> 00:25:38,500
How many years are still singing

340
00:25:38,500 --> 00:25:43,500
The bottle of fate

341
00:25:43,500 --> 00:25:50,500
No matter if I'm gone

342
00:25:53,500 --> 00:25:54,500
I'll wait for you

343
00:25:54,500 --> 00:25:55,500
Where to?

344
00:25:55,500 --> 00:25:57,500
I'll wait for you to answer me

345
00:25:57,500 --> 00:25:59,500
Although it's a deserted place

346
00:25:59,500 --> 00:26:02,500
There's no place to be deserted

347
00:26:02,500 --> 00:26:03,500
Master, bad news

348
00:26:03,500 --> 00:26:05,500
Miss and the guest are gone

349
00:26:05,500 --> 00:26:06,500
This way

350
00:26:06,500 --> 00:26:08,500
Don't let people die

351
00:26:08,500 --> 00:26:12,500
Her Miaoyang Mi

352
00:26:12,500 --> 00:26:14,500
還有速速�Xing ready

353
00:26:36,500 --> 00:26:39,580
Brother...

354
00:27:04,340 --> 00:27:05,540
Jack...

355
00:27:05,540 --> 00:27:07,100
Dad, dad!

356
00:27:07,100 --> 00:27:09,940
Don't leave him! I'm going!

357
00:27:09,940 --> 00:27:11,940
No!

358
00:27:35,540 --> 00:27:38,340
He won't let me go back to Miss Qi.

359
00:27:38,340 --> 00:27:41,740
He's always in the house, staring at the real-life portrait of Hua Shi Zhen.

360
00:27:42,940 --> 00:27:44,940
I can't save him.

361
00:27:45,740 --> 00:27:49,540
That's why you were seriously injured and escaped. You didn't have a choice.

362
00:27:49,540 --> 00:27:54,940
To recover your medical power, you can only kill people and get rid of your power.

363
00:27:54,940 --> 00:27:59,240
And you specifically killed the bride and made the fear of death.

364
00:27:59,240 --> 00:28:04,340
You made people dare not marry you just to stop Miss Qi from getting married.

365
00:28:05,540 --> 00:28:11,440
I can stop anyone, but I can't stop his father who is not good at love.

366
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:16,440
He is now a god.

367
00:28:19,040 --> 00:28:21,540
I can't get rid of the dream.

368
00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:24,640
I can't get rid of it either.

369
00:28:27,640 --> 00:28:30,140
He Hao Jie.

370
00:28:30,140 --> 00:28:34,140
You can just eat the meat from him.

371
00:28:35,940 --> 00:28:37,940
I can't eat it.

372
00:28:40,940 --> 00:28:44,940
Don't bother me. I'll wake him up.

373
00:28:53,540 --> 00:28:56,540
Give me back my life.

374
00:28:57,740 --> 00:29:02,540
Xia Miao, come with me.

375
00:29:03,540 --> 00:29:04,740
Don't look for me.

376
00:29:04,740 --> 00:29:09,740
If you want to find a monster, you can kill him with the demon's knife.

377
00:29:09,740 --> 00:29:11,740
You can just eat him!

378
00:29:19,140 --> 00:29:22,740
You should just eat him.

379
00:29:23,740 --> 00:29:25,740
Wake up.

380
00:29:26,740 --> 00:29:28,740
You...

381
00:29:28,740 --> 00:29:30,740
Don't kill me.

382
00:29:30,740 --> 00:29:31,740
You...

383
00:29:31,740 --> 00:29:33,740
Don't come over.

384
00:29:33,740 --> 00:29:34,740
You...

385
00:29:34,740 --> 00:29:36,740
Don't come over.

386
00:29:36,740 --> 00:29:38,740
I didn't kill you.

387
00:29:38,740 --> 00:29:40,740
Don't come over.

388
00:29:40,740 --> 00:29:41,740
Don't come over.

389
00:29:41,740 --> 00:29:42,740
You are already dead.

390
00:29:42,740 --> 00:29:43,740
Go, go, go.

391
00:29:43,740 --> 00:29:45,740
You are all dead.

392
00:29:45,740 --> 00:29:47,740
Don't worry.

393
00:29:50,740 --> 00:29:52,740
He is really a murderer.

394
00:29:53,740 --> 00:29:55,740
It's really a murder.

395
00:29:55,740 --> 00:29:58,740
When my Cloud Sword was in the Qifu Mountain,

396
00:29:58,740 --> 00:30:00,740
I felt that place was in trouble.

397
00:30:23,740 --> 00:30:26,740
Great 증 Карwa 4000

398
00:30:37,740 --> 00:30:40,740
The 500 crystal exhorting was made by

399
00:30:40,740 --> 00:30:42,740
a ray of transcript fuguera.

400
00:30:42,740 --> 00:30:45,240
If you could Pacific Ocean

401
00:30:45,240 --> 00:30:50,340
you could possibly raise an Sen lectures by

402
00:30:50,340 --> 00:31:00,340
One, two, three, four, five.

403
00:31:00,340 --> 00:31:03,340
Today, I have no strength left.

404
00:31:03,340 --> 00:31:05,340
I'm in trouble.

405
00:31:05,340 --> 00:31:08,340
In that situation,

406
00:31:08,340 --> 00:31:13,340
they were all the servants who planned to help me and Miss Qi.

407
00:31:13,340 --> 00:31:15,340
They killed them.

408
00:31:15,340 --> 00:31:18,340
They wanted to kill them.

409
00:31:18,340 --> 00:31:20,340
They wanted to kill them.

410
00:31:20,340 --> 00:31:23,340
They wanted to kill them.

411
00:31:23,340 --> 00:31:27,340
They must have died very hard.

412
00:31:27,340 --> 00:31:30,340
The more they died, the more they were not willing to do it.

413
00:31:30,340 --> 00:31:33,340
The strength in the hospital should be more important.

414
00:31:33,340 --> 00:31:37,340
But my Cloud Sword only felt the weak strength.

415
00:31:37,340 --> 00:31:40,340
That led to my suspicion.

416
00:31:41,340 --> 00:31:45,340
Someone has lost his strength.

417
00:31:51,340 --> 00:31:54,340
You don't suspect me, do you?

418
00:31:54,340 --> 00:31:56,340
I didn't suspect you.

419
00:31:56,340 --> 00:31:58,340
I'm sure it's you.

420
00:32:01,340 --> 00:32:04,340
You came to Ji Yao Si and said you had helped us catch the person.

421
00:32:04,340 --> 00:32:06,340
You had already gone to Qi Fu.

422
00:32:06,340 --> 00:32:08,340
You found out that it was an accident.

423
00:32:09,340 --> 00:32:14,340
The servants of Qi Fu said they saw a ghost on the tree a few days ago.

424
00:32:16,340 --> 00:32:19,340
Who's there?

425
00:32:30,340 --> 00:32:32,340
Ghost!

426
00:32:32,340 --> 00:32:35,340
There must be a pair of wings in the ghost.

427
00:32:35,340 --> 00:32:37,340
It must be you, right?

428
00:32:37,340 --> 00:32:39,340
Zhang Yizhou.

429
00:32:42,340 --> 00:32:45,340
You absorbed the power of the bottom of the well

430
00:32:45,340 --> 00:32:49,340
and left everything behind to start your plan.

431
00:33:05,340 --> 00:33:07,340
Zhu Yan.

432
00:33:07,340 --> 00:33:10,340
I won't answer your question.

433
00:33:10,340 --> 00:33:13,340
Bai Ze Ling has lost her power.

434
00:33:13,340 --> 00:33:17,340
Why did you come here to do something so important?

435
00:33:17,340 --> 00:33:21,340
Who said I was here to catch you and help you?

436
00:33:21,340 --> 00:33:24,340
I was here to help you.

437
00:33:24,340 --> 00:33:27,340
You're not here to help me.

438
00:33:27,340 --> 00:33:30,340
I'm here to help you.

439
00:33:30,340 --> 00:33:32,340
I'm here to help you.

440
00:33:32,340 --> 00:33:34,340
I'm here to help you.

441
00:33:34,340 --> 00:33:40,340
You can help him to clear the water well and put it in Qi Fu.

442
00:33:40,340 --> 00:33:43,340
You don't have to deny it.

443
00:33:43,340 --> 00:33:46,340
The well has familiar demons.

444
00:33:46,340 --> 00:33:49,340
It makes people feel young.

445
00:33:51,340 --> 00:33:56,340
I didn't expect Lord Zhu to be so familiar with my demons.

446
00:33:57,340 --> 00:34:00,340
It's indeed the soul of my room.

447
00:34:02,340 --> 00:34:05,340
I'm here to help you.

448
00:34:05,340 --> 00:34:08,340
I'm here to help you.

449
00:34:08,340 --> 00:34:11,340
I'm here to help you.

450
00:34:11,340 --> 00:34:14,340
I'm here to help you.

451
00:34:14,340 --> 00:34:17,340
I'm here to help you.

452
00:34:17,340 --> 00:34:20,340
I'm here to help you.

453
00:34:20,340 --> 00:34:23,340
I'm here to help you.

454
00:34:23,340 --> 00:34:26,340
I'm here to help you.

455
00:34:26,340 --> 00:34:29,340
I'm here to help you.

456
00:34:29,340 --> 00:34:32,340
I can't imagine

457
00:34:32,340 --> 00:34:38,340
I would even hate to see Lord starting a duel with him.

458
00:34:38,340 --> 00:34:42,340
I was very curious,

459
00:34:42,340 --> 00:34:45,340
why didn't you bring Qi to him directly?

460
00:34:45,340 --> 00:34:50,340
Why did you want to have him engaged in a battle?

461
00:34:50,340 --> 00:34:54,340
I thought myself as I witnessed the death.

462
00:34:54,340 --> 00:34:56,340
I didn't mean to hurt her.

463
00:34:59,340 --> 00:35:01,340
I killed so many people.

464
00:35:02,340 --> 00:35:04,340
And you also escaped.

465
00:35:05,340 --> 00:35:07,340
And she was kind.

466
00:35:08,340 --> 00:35:10,340
She must be married.

467
00:35:10,340 --> 00:35:12,340
All I did was

468
00:35:13,340 --> 00:35:17,340
hoping she wouldn't be forced to marry the person she didn't like.

469
00:35:18,340 --> 00:35:21,340
I hope she can live her life.

470
00:35:23,340 --> 00:35:25,340
I brought her here

471
00:35:26,340 --> 00:35:28,340
and you and Siwen.

472
00:35:29,340 --> 00:35:31,340
Isn't that right?

473
00:35:34,340 --> 00:35:36,340
I'm guilty.

474
00:35:37,340 --> 00:35:40,340
I don't face the same kind of promise.

475
00:35:41,340 --> 00:35:44,340
I'm afraid she will be in a big dream.

476
00:35:44,340 --> 00:35:47,340
I'm afraid she will be in a big dream.

477
00:35:48,340 --> 00:35:50,340
I wish you

478
00:35:50,340 --> 00:35:52,340
a bright future.

479
00:35:53,340 --> 00:35:55,340
A bright future.

480
00:35:56,340 --> 00:35:58,340
I wish you all the best.

481
00:36:08,340 --> 00:36:10,340
I'm so emotional.

482
00:36:11,340 --> 00:36:14,340
You're getting more and more like a person.

483
00:36:19,340 --> 00:36:21,340
What about you?

484
00:36:23,340 --> 00:36:25,340
You won't help me with nothing.

485
00:36:26,340 --> 00:36:28,340
What do you want?

486
00:36:32,340 --> 00:36:34,340
Why did you do that?

487
00:36:34,340 --> 00:36:36,340
What is your purpose?

488
00:36:37,340 --> 00:36:39,340
I told you before.

489
00:36:40,340 --> 00:36:42,340
I did it for Bai Ze Ling.

490
00:36:44,340 --> 00:36:46,340
Bai Ze Ling?

491
00:36:46,340 --> 00:36:47,340
You have a dream

492
00:36:47,340 --> 00:36:49,340
that reminds you of the past you had forgotten.

493
00:36:49,340 --> 00:36:52,340
And Zhao Yuan Zhou asked me to make you this dream.

494
00:36:52,340 --> 00:36:54,340
I saw it in your dream.

495
00:37:02,340 --> 00:37:04,340
Is it true?

496
00:37:12,340 --> 00:37:14,340
It's true.

497
00:37:18,340 --> 00:37:20,340
It's true.

498
00:37:23,340 --> 00:37:25,340
So you want to make Ranyi

499
00:37:25,340 --> 00:37:27,340
use her dream

500
00:37:27,340 --> 00:37:29,340
to remind me of Bai Ze Ling's past?

501
00:37:32,340 --> 00:37:34,340
That's not a dream.

502
00:37:35,340 --> 00:37:37,340
It's your memory.

503
00:37:39,340 --> 00:37:41,340
But why I don't have this memory?

504
00:37:53,340 --> 00:37:55,340
What did you see in your dream?

505
00:37:59,340 --> 00:38:01,340
I saw

506
00:38:01,340 --> 00:38:04,340
that master did send me Bai Ze Ling.

507
00:38:05,340 --> 00:38:08,340
My son did make Bai Ze Ling.

508
00:38:14,340 --> 00:38:15,340
Why

509
00:38:15,340 --> 00:38:18,340
you don't have Bai Ze Ling in your body?

510
00:38:23,340 --> 00:38:26,340
Maybe he still has his memory.

511
00:38:33,340 --> 00:38:34,340
Zhao Yuan Zhou,

512
00:38:34,340 --> 00:38:35,340
I have done

513
00:38:35,340 --> 00:38:37,340
what I promised you.

514
00:38:37,340 --> 00:38:39,340
What about you?

515
00:38:43,340 --> 00:38:45,340
Master Qi has been punished.

516
00:38:47,340 --> 00:38:48,340
Then his freedom

517
00:38:48,340 --> 00:38:50,340
will be taken away.

518
00:38:52,340 --> 00:38:54,340
What about you?

519
00:39:00,340 --> 00:39:02,340
I will.

520
00:39:16,340 --> 00:39:18,340
After tomorrow,

521
00:39:18,340 --> 00:39:20,340
everyone will think that

522
00:39:20,340 --> 00:39:22,340
he is killed by the water.

523
00:39:23,340 --> 00:39:25,340
He is free.

524
00:39:25,340 --> 00:39:28,340
He can go anywhere he wants.

525
00:39:30,340 --> 00:39:32,340
The book says

526
00:39:32,340 --> 00:39:34,340
the East Sea of the Great Wilderness

527
00:39:34,340 --> 00:39:36,340
is the best place to kill.

528
00:39:40,340 --> 00:39:43,340
I want to go and see the scenery.

529
00:39:51,340 --> 00:39:53,340
Thank you.

530
00:39:56,340 --> 00:39:58,340
If you remember your crime,

531
00:39:58,340 --> 00:40:01,340
then you can come with me to the Jiao Si.

532
00:40:03,340 --> 00:40:05,340
Someone is coming.

533
00:40:20,340 --> 00:40:23,340
I didn't hide him in the Jiao Si Hall.

534
00:40:23,340 --> 00:40:25,340
How could he come here?

535
00:40:25,340 --> 00:40:28,340
I didn't expect that you are still here.

536
00:40:51,340 --> 00:40:53,340
Where is Ranyi?

537
00:41:00,340 --> 00:41:02,340
Xiao Zhu, you...

538
00:41:03,340 --> 00:41:06,340
He won't run away like this.

539
00:41:08,340 --> 00:41:10,340
Let's go.

540
00:41:21,340 --> 00:41:23,340
I know that

541
00:41:24,340 --> 00:41:26,340
no matter what you do,

542
00:41:27,340 --> 00:41:29,340
no matter what you do,

543
00:41:31,340 --> 00:41:33,340
we will live and die together.

544
00:41:34,340 --> 00:41:36,340
We will live and die together.

545
00:41:38,340 --> 00:41:40,340
I will do whatever you want.

546
00:41:41,340 --> 00:41:43,340
I will do whatever you want.

547
00:41:44,340 --> 00:41:46,340
I will do whatever you want.

548
00:41:46,340 --> 00:41:49,340
I will do whatever you want.

549
00:42:13,340 --> 00:42:15,340
Let's go back to the Tahuang together.

550
00:42:17,340 --> 00:42:20,340
You escaped from the plane.

551
00:42:20,340 --> 00:42:22,340
Why did you go back?

552
00:42:24,340 --> 00:42:26,340
People say

553
00:42:26,340 --> 00:42:28,340
the people are looking for a house

554
00:42:28,340 --> 00:42:30,340
that can keep their sleep

555
00:42:30,340 --> 00:42:32,340
for the rest of their lives.

556
00:42:32,340 --> 00:42:34,340
And only people

557
00:42:35,340 --> 00:42:38,340
will think of the fallen leaves.

558
00:42:42,340 --> 00:42:45,340
I used to read a lot of books with him.

559
00:42:46,340 --> 00:42:48,340
I wrote a lot of words.

560
00:42:49,340 --> 00:42:52,340
But I still don't understand what I want to do.

561
00:42:53,340 --> 00:42:55,340
Since it's a revenge,

562
00:42:56,340 --> 00:42:59,340
why did so many people chase after him?

563
00:43:00,340 --> 00:43:02,340
Now I understand.

564
00:43:03,340 --> 00:43:05,340
I don't want to be a stranger.

565
00:43:05,340 --> 00:43:07,340
I want to be a person.

566
00:43:07,340 --> 00:43:09,340
What about the people you hurt?

567
00:43:10,340 --> 00:43:12,340
They want to be a person,

568
00:43:12,340 --> 00:43:14,340
and they want to be a ghost.

569
00:43:14,340 --> 00:43:16,340
They want to be a person.

570
00:43:29,340 --> 00:43:31,340
You saved me.

571
00:43:31,340 --> 00:43:33,340
But you want to catch me today.

572
00:43:34,340 --> 00:43:36,340
I helped you not to be disturbed by nightmares for years.

573
00:43:36,340 --> 00:43:38,340
And I am grateful to you.

574
00:43:38,340 --> 00:43:40,340
Can't you let us go?

575
00:43:40,340 --> 00:43:43,340
My brother was a kind demon.

576
00:43:44,340 --> 00:43:46,340
And now you are not the one who killed innocent people.

577
00:43:46,340 --> 00:43:49,340
I will definitely take you to the hell.

578
00:43:50,340 --> 00:43:52,340
The only thing I can do

579
00:43:53,340 --> 00:43:55,340
is to beg for mercy for you.

580
00:43:56,340 --> 00:43:58,340
To punish you.

581
00:43:58,340 --> 00:44:00,340
Yes.

582
00:44:02,340 --> 00:44:04,340
I killed innocent people.

583
00:44:05,340 --> 00:44:08,340
But I gave them the most beautiful dream.

584
00:44:09,340 --> 00:44:11,340
Their life

585
00:44:11,340 --> 00:44:13,340
was filled with pain and suffering.

586
00:44:14,340 --> 00:44:17,340
I gave them the happiness of the dream.

587
00:44:19,340 --> 00:44:21,340
The dream.

588
00:44:24,340 --> 00:44:27,340
The people's words are clear.

589
00:44:30,340 --> 00:44:32,340
The world is hard to find.

590
00:44:33,340 --> 00:44:35,340
The dream is the best.

591
00:44:38,340 --> 00:44:41,340
The dream is the best in my life.

592
00:44:42,340 --> 00:44:45,340
In my dream, their wishes are fulfilled.

593
00:44:46,340 --> 00:44:48,340
They used their most desired way

594
00:44:48,340 --> 00:44:50,340
to live a happy life.

595
00:44:51,340 --> 00:44:53,340
Isn't that good?

596
00:44:54,340 --> 00:44:56,340
It's a dream.

597
00:44:56,340 --> 00:44:59,340
You shouldn't have made a decision for them.

598
00:45:01,340 --> 00:45:03,340
I don't want to be a demon. I want to be a human.

599
00:45:03,340 --> 00:45:05,340
Who will decide this?

600
00:45:06,340 --> 00:45:07,340
Is it you?

601
00:45:08,340 --> 00:45:10,340
Bai Ze Shen Yu.

602
00:45:12,340 --> 00:45:14,340
Fu You You is a good person.

603
00:45:14,340 --> 00:45:16,340
But he can only belong to the rules.

604
00:45:16,340 --> 00:45:18,340
He is destined to be a demon.

605
00:45:18,340 --> 00:45:20,340
Who will make the decision for him?

606
00:45:21,340 --> 00:45:23,340
The world is hard to find.

607
00:45:23,340 --> 00:45:25,340
Everything is enough.

608
00:45:25,340 --> 00:45:27,340
It's because of the world.

609
00:45:27,340 --> 00:45:31,340
So it's dangerous to have power under the command.

610
00:45:37,340 --> 00:45:39,340
How will Ji Yao Si punish me?

611
00:45:39,340 --> 00:45:41,340
Although Master Qi hurt you first,

612
00:45:42,340 --> 00:45:44,340
you hurt dozens of people after all.

613
00:45:44,340 --> 00:45:46,340
There are no more words.

614
00:45:46,340 --> 00:45:48,340
At least a thousand years.

615
00:45:49,340 --> 00:45:51,340
A thousand years.

616
00:45:56,340 --> 00:45:58,340
Your human breath is really big.

617
00:45:58,340 --> 00:46:01,340
It's hard to speak to the demon.

618
00:46:02,340 --> 00:46:04,340
But life is short.

619
00:46:05,340 --> 00:46:07,340
It's hard to say.

620
00:46:08,340 --> 00:46:10,340
It's short but it's pure.

621
00:46:10,340 --> 00:46:12,340
That is to say,

622
00:46:12,340 --> 00:46:14,340
in the next life,

623
00:46:14,340 --> 00:46:16,340
you can't see it again.

624
00:46:29,340 --> 00:46:31,340
I don't want to.

625
00:46:31,340 --> 00:46:34,340
You can't do that.

626
00:46:37,340 --> 00:46:39,340
You can't do that.

627
00:46:39,340 --> 00:46:41,340
You can't do that.

628
00:46:41,340 --> 00:46:43,340
You can't do that.

629
00:46:43,340 --> 00:46:45,340
You can't do that.

630
00:46:45,340 --> 00:46:47,340
You can't do that.

631
00:46:47,340 --> 00:46:49,340
You can't do that.

632
00:46:49,340 --> 00:46:51,340
You can't do that.

633
00:46:51,340 --> 00:46:53,340
You can't do that.

634
00:46:53,340 --> 00:46:55,340
You can't do that.

635
00:46:55,340 --> 00:46:57,340
You can't do that.

636
00:46:57,340 --> 00:46:59,340
You can't do that.

637
00:46:59,340 --> 00:47:01,340
You can't do that.

638
00:47:01,340 --> 00:47:03,340
You can't do that.

639
00:47:03,340 --> 00:47:05,340
You can't do that.

640
00:47:06,340 --> 00:47:08,340
You can't do that.

641
00:47:08,340 --> 00:47:10,340
You can't do that.

642
00:47:10,340 --> 00:47:12,340
You can't do that.

643
00:47:12,340 --> 00:47:14,340
You can't do that.

644
00:47:14,340 --> 00:47:16,340
You can't do that.

645
00:47:16,340 --> 00:47:18,340
You can't do that.

646
00:47:18,340 --> 00:47:20,340
You can't do that.

647
00:47:20,340 --> 00:47:22,340
You can't do that.

648
00:47:22,340 --> 00:47:24,340
You can't do that.

649
00:47:24,340 --> 00:47:26,340
You can't do that.

650
00:47:26,340 --> 00:47:28,340
You can't do that.

651
00:47:28,340 --> 00:47:30,340
You can't do that.

652
00:47:30,340 --> 00:47:32,340
You can't do that.

653
00:47:32,340 --> 00:47:34,340
You can't do that.

654
00:47:34,340 --> 00:47:36,340
You can't do that.

655
00:48:04,340 --> 00:48:06,340
You can't do that.

656
00:48:06,340 --> 00:48:08,340
You can't do that.

657
00:48:08,340 --> 00:48:10,340
You can't do that.

658
00:48:10,340 --> 00:48:12,340
You can't do that.

659
00:48:12,340 --> 00:48:14,340
You can't do that.

660
00:48:14,340 --> 00:48:16,340
You can't do that.

661
00:48:16,340 --> 00:48:18,340
You can't do that.

662
00:48:18,340 --> 00:48:20,340
You can't do that.

663
00:48:20,340 --> 00:48:22,340
You can't do that.

664
00:48:22,340 --> 00:48:24,340
You can't do that.

665
00:48:24,340 --> 00:48:26,340
You can't do that.

666
00:48:26,340 --> 00:48:28,340
You can't do that.

667
00:48:28,340 --> 00:48:30,340
You can't do that.

668
00:48:30,340 --> 00:48:32,340
You can't do that.

669
