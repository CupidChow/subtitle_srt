[Fangs of Fortune]

00:01:43,130 --> 00:01:45,900
[Episode 21]

3
00:01:55,860 --> 00:01:57,050
Situ Ming,

4
00:01:57,670 --> 00:01:59,250
you hid a criminal.

5
00:01:59,780 --> 00:02:01,130
Do you admit your crime?

6
00:02:16,430 --> 00:02:18,230
I wanted to catch Zhao Yuanzhou,

7
00:02:18,290 --> 00:02:20,220
but I found something unexpected.

8
00:02:25,550 --> 00:02:26,800
Zhao Yuanzhou,

9
00:02:26,870 --> 00:02:27,870
no matter where you hide,

10
00:02:27,870 --> 00:02:29,310
it's all in vain.

11
00:02:30,579 --> 00:02:32,550
You underestimate the demon energy tracking spell

12
00:02:32,550 --> 00:02:34,150
of the Chongwu Camp.

13
00:02:37,110 --> 00:02:38,120
Indeed.

14
00:02:38,460 --> 00:02:39,800
You are truly dogs.

15
00:02:43,950 --> 00:02:45,310
Still throwing insults

16
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:47,220
when you're facing death?

17
00:02:52,950 --> 00:02:54,400
Useless.

18
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:57,710
Stop, Master!

19
00:02:57,710 --> 00:02:58,390
Jiu!

20
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:01,550
I won't allow you to hurt my friends.

21
00:03:15,970 --> 00:03:16,920
Bai Jiu,

22
00:03:17,550 --> 00:03:19,550
since you still call me Master,

23
00:03:20,970 --> 00:03:22,990
shouldn't you repay me

24
00:03:22,990 --> 00:03:25,470
and take Zhao Yuanzhou's inner core now?

25
00:03:26,850 --> 00:03:28,180
Repay you?

26
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:30,480
Why don't we repay you with a beating?

27
00:03:32,820 --> 00:03:34,970
Who helped you when you were the most

28
00:03:34,990 --> 00:03:36,320
confused and helpless?

29
00:03:37,030 --> 00:03:38,430
Who took you in

30
00:03:38,450 --> 00:03:39,850
and taught you medicine?

31
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:42,900
Will you repay my kindness with hatred?

32
00:03:44,630 --> 00:03:45,270
Jiu,

33
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:46,530
don't trust him.

34
00:03:46,829 --> 00:03:48,290
He taught you those skills

35
00:03:48,790 --> 00:03:50,750
just to use you to harm people.

36
00:03:51,750 --> 00:03:52,550
That's right.

37
00:03:53,980 --> 00:03:55,170
I must

38
00:03:55,510 --> 00:03:58,840
take responsibility for and fix some mistakes personally.

39
00:03:59,930 --> 00:04:01,610
I won't respect you anymore.

40
00:04:03,180 --> 00:04:04,130
Previously,

41
00:04:04,270 --> 00:04:05,070
I hurt

42
00:04:05,150 --> 00:04:06,830
and lied to my friends.

43
00:04:07,190 --> 00:04:09,400
I will do my best to make up for it.

44
00:04:14,020 --> 00:04:14,980
Sister Pei.

45
00:04:15,430 --> 00:04:16,490
Give me the arrow.

46
00:04:18,269 --> 00:04:19,440
What are you doing?

47
00:04:42,550 --> 00:04:43,110
Jiu.

48
00:04:43,140 --> 00:04:43,920
Jiu.

49
00:04:44,270 --> 00:04:46,000
Don't hurt yourself like this.

50
00:04:50,790 --> 00:04:53,720
Isn't Little Bunny the most timid and afraid of pain?

51
00:04:55,230 --> 00:04:56,470
I am timid

52
00:04:58,030 --> 00:04:59,090
and afraid of pain,

53
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:03,340
but I'm more afraid of losing you all.

54
00:05:13,630 --> 00:05:14,710
From now on,

55
00:05:15,350 --> 00:05:17,480
I'm no longer a member of Chongwu Camp.

56
00:05:17,550 --> 00:05:19,310
I won't let you manipulate me

57
00:05:19,310 --> 00:05:20,190
as your puppet anymore.

58
00:05:20,190 --> 00:05:20,990
Enough!

59
00:05:23,230 --> 00:05:24,880
Since this is your decision,

60
00:05:27,210 --> 00:05:29,060
don't blame me for being cruel.

61
00:05:51,630 --> 00:05:52,580
Shoot!

62
00:06:37,060 --> 00:06:37,920
They can't be killed.

63
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:39,320
Demonized humans again?

64
00:06:39,630 --> 00:06:40,830
Zhao Yuanzhou.

65
00:06:41,320 --> 00:06:42,240
Do something.

66
00:06:53,320 --> 00:06:54,740
Stop.

67
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:02,480
Your magic

68
00:07:02,770 --> 00:07:05,830
is useless against these demonized humans and arrows.

69
00:07:07,110 --> 00:07:10,170
My Demon Slaying Arrow specializes in killing demons.

70
00:07:10,700 --> 00:07:12,640
How can you control it?

71
00:07:15,430 --> 00:07:16,490
Zhao Yuanzhou,

72
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:19,640
don't waste your energy in resisting.

73
00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:21,090
Surrender.

74
00:08:11,820 --> 00:08:12,500
Oh no.

75
00:08:12,760 --> 00:08:14,280
There's a silver needle on the arrow.

76
00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:16,210
He sealed the Great Demon's touch.

77
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:18,870
Zhao Yuanzhou.

78
00:08:19,110 --> 00:08:21,150
Now, there's only one last step left

79
00:08:21,150 --> 00:08:22,550
to seal your five senses.

80
00:08:23,170 --> 00:08:24,750
I just need to use the silver needle

81
00:08:24,750 --> 00:08:26,300
to seal your sense of touch

82
00:08:26,750 --> 00:08:28,750
and everything will be set.

83
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:30,010
Master,

84
00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:32,270
why will sealing a demon's five senses

85
00:08:32,270 --> 00:08:34,270
make them spit out their inner core?

86
00:08:34,470 --> 00:08:36,070
With the five senses sealed,

87
00:08:36,110 --> 00:08:37,309
the physical body will become

88
00:08:37,309 --> 00:08:38,830
a tight jar.

89
00:08:39,190 --> 00:08:41,120
The inner core has a conscious mind

90
00:08:41,710 --> 00:08:43,270
and will struggle

91
00:08:43,270 --> 00:08:44,600
like a drowning person.

92
00:08:47,430 --> 00:08:48,230
Besides,

93
00:08:49,310 --> 00:08:52,110
the Ever-Burning Wood is in Zhao Yuanzhou's body.

94
00:08:53,300 --> 00:08:55,160
After the five senses are sealed,

95
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:57,980
the fire will burn his entire body.

96
00:08:59,450 --> 00:09:01,060
It'll be torturous.

97
00:09:03,350 --> 00:09:04,390
Zhao Yuanzhou.

98
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:07,400
The last needle has been completed.

99
00:09:07,420 --> 00:09:09,070
Spit out your inner core.

100
00:09:14,270 --> 00:09:15,670
Zhao Yuanzhou.

101
00:09:17,310 --> 00:09:18,420
Zhao Yuanzhou!

102
00:10:34,390 --> 00:10:35,590
Zhao Yuanzhou.

103
00:10:37,470 --> 00:10:38,690
Zhao Yuanzhou!

104
00:10:58,430 --> 00:10:59,320
Sir.

105
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:01,080
What's going on?

106
00:11:03,450 --> 00:11:04,980
Should we just capture him

107
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:07,160
and take the inner core by force?

108
00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:24,910
Wen Xiao killed the Prime Minister.

109
00:12:24,910 --> 00:12:26,750
Pei Sijing released Zhao Yuanzhou privately.

110
00:12:26,750 --> 00:12:28,070
Arrest them immediately

111
00:12:28,070 --> 00:12:29,730
to wait for their punishment.

112
00:12:49,510 --> 00:12:50,310
Time to eat.

113
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:01,390
So bland.

114
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,890
I'm a demoness who eats humans.

115
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:05,900
Fresh human flesh

116
00:13:06,380 --> 00:13:08,600
is much better than fish and meat.

117
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:10,140
Cut the crap.

118
00:13:10,270 --> 00:13:12,800
The Chongwu Army has seen all kinds of demons.

119
00:13:12,870 --> 00:13:13,710
Look up

120
00:13:13,710 --> 00:13:14,750
at the beast blood talismans.

121
00:13:14,750 --> 00:13:17,680
They're used to suppress you, evil and sneaky demon.

122
00:13:42,580 --> 00:13:43,610
At this time,

123
00:13:43,840 --> 00:13:46,040
you're still in the mood to joke around.

124
00:13:48,950 --> 00:13:50,910
Aren't you worried at all?

125
00:13:56,470 --> 00:13:59,100
It's my first time being a caged animal.

126
00:13:59,950 --> 00:14:01,590
How can I not worry?

127
00:14:04,870 --> 00:14:06,730
I'm talking about Zhao Yuanzhou.

128
00:14:14,970 --> 00:14:16,740
If he goes out of control again,

129
00:14:17,470 --> 00:14:19,320
the world will be over.

130
00:14:21,010 --> 00:14:22,290
Aren't you worried?

131
00:14:29,710 --> 00:14:31,950
I picked up the flagon he left behind.

132
00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:33,850
He drank a lot.

133
00:14:34,330 --> 00:14:37,190
He also has the help Mountain God Ying Zhao's power.

134
00:14:37,300 --> 00:14:40,900
He should be able to suppress the malicious energy temporarily.

135
00:14:42,820 --> 00:14:44,410
Since he chose to run away,

136
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,580
he must still be clear-headed.

137
00:14:47,780 --> 00:14:49,440
He knew he couldn't stay long.

138
00:14:52,280 --> 00:14:53,650
Where would he go?

139
00:14:56,650 --> 00:14:59,180
He'd probably escape to Peach Blossom House.

140
00:14:59,520 --> 00:15:01,690
He set a barrier there.

141
00:15:01,990 --> 00:15:04,050
Outsiders are unable to go in and out.

142
00:15:04,980 --> 00:15:06,770
He once told me

143
00:15:07,910 --> 00:15:09,490
that if one day,

144
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:12,740
he felt like he was going to lose control,

145
00:15:12,890 --> 00:15:14,780
he would lock himself up.

146
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:18,280
So even if he went out of control,

147
00:15:19,020 --> 00:15:20,540
he wouldn't hurt anyone.

148
00:15:25,830 --> 00:15:28,220
But this is just a temporary measure.

149
00:15:28,680 --> 00:15:29,560
So,

150
00:15:30,210 --> 00:15:32,360
we should find the Divine Wood as soon as possible

151
00:15:32,360 --> 00:15:33,890
and repair the Baize Token.

152
00:15:36,650 --> 00:15:38,750
Zhuo will find a way.

153
00:15:41,550 --> 00:15:42,020
Yes.

154
00:16:34,020 --> 00:16:36,990
Why are you still struggling?

155
00:16:39,990 --> 00:16:43,430
This is the strongest power in the world.

156
00:16:44,770 --> 00:16:47,200
You can destroy the world

157
00:16:47,280 --> 00:16:49,040
and do anything.

158
00:16:50,300 --> 00:16:52,390
Why do you refuse?

159
00:16:56,320 --> 00:17:00,260
Because I don't want to destroy the world.

160
00:17:03,950 --> 00:17:05,890
No matter what you want,

161
00:17:07,750 --> 00:17:10,160
the invincible power

162
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:12,290
can do it for you.

163
00:17:22,670 --> 00:17:25,390
I just want the people I cherish

164
00:17:27,990 --> 00:17:29,840
to be safe,

165
00:17:31,370 --> 00:17:32,690
happy,

166
00:17:33,350 --> 00:17:34,120
and content.

167
00:17:59,960 --> 00:18:02,640
How long can you hold on for?

168
00:18:04,550 --> 00:18:07,050
Why don't you just

169
00:18:07,900 --> 00:18:10,790
give yourself to me obediently like before?

170
00:18:15,950 --> 00:18:19,410
Fighting against yourself is like going against the current.

171
00:18:19,980 --> 00:18:22,330
It's futile.

172
00:18:22,630 --> 00:18:24,310
Why endure the pain

173
00:18:28,360 --> 00:18:30,010
of fire burning your heart?

174
00:18:35,900 --> 00:18:38,330
So you don't understand.

175
00:18:47,990 --> 00:18:49,670
What?

176
00:18:56,560 --> 00:18:59,080
♫A lone boat drifts through the world♫

177
00:18:59,100 --> 00:19:01,670
♫The heart feels bitter, then sweet♫

178
00:19:02,030 --> 00:19:07,070
♫Can't distinguish night from day♫

179
00:19:08,340 --> 00:19:10,130
♫At the edge of the dreamscape♫

180
00:19:10,300 --> 00:19:12,790
♫Someone is longing for♫

181
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:14,030
♫Softly calling for♫

182
00:19:14,110 --> 00:19:18,270
♫A past that can't be brought back♫

183
00:19:18,680 --> 00:19:21,210
♫The world echoes with a single sigh♫

184
00:19:21,270 --> 00:19:23,870
♫Love and hate each fills half the heart♫

185
00:19:24,060 --> 00:19:29,160
♫The years are filled with grudges and grace♫

186
00:19:30,340 --> 00:19:32,390
♫The cry of summer cicadas♫

187
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:35,040
♫The slumber of winter snow♫

188
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:40,550
♫No idle wishes and no hopeless longing for eternity♫

189
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:46,110
♫Who saw the young man in beautiful clothes♫

190
00:19:46,330 --> 00:19:51,650
♫One step at a time, chasing every yesterday♫

191
00:19:52,290 --> 00:19:54,850
♫The sun beams down on the world♫

192
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,520
♫Put everything behind♫

193
00:19:57,760 --> 00:20:03,040
♫You appear in my dream♫

194
00:20:11,020 --> 00:20:15,860
♫The flower in my palm♫

195
00:20:16,160 --> 00:20:21,350
♫Is everchanging♫

196
00:20:21,980 --> 00:20:26,870
♫Sand slips through fingertips♫

197
00:20:27,560 --> 00:20:32,280
♫Struggling again and again♫

198
00:20:33,300 --> 00:20:38,070
♫The sea of suffering has no end♫

199
00:20:38,980 --> 00:20:42,010
♫The spring breeze asks him♫

200
00:20:42,160 --> 00:20:49,440
♫What troubles turned his hair white♫

201
00:21:13,050 --> 00:21:15,570
♫One light, one fire, one crescent moon♫

202
00:21:15,860 --> 00:21:18,410
♫The vow of life and death♫

203
00:21:18,760 --> 00:21:23,760
♫Yet tears leave without a goodbye♫

204
00:21:24,270 --> 00:21:26,840
♫No need to borrow strong wine; it's in my heart♫

205
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:29,590
♫The dark hair doesn't turn white like snow♫

206
00:21:29,690 --> 00:21:31,120
♫Some other time♫

207
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:34,870
♫Let's watch the setting sun again♫

208
00:21:35,430 --> 00:21:37,950
♫A lone boat drifts through the world♫

209
00:21:38,030 --> 00:21:40,690
♫The heart feels bitter, then sweet♫

210
00:21:41,130 --> 00:21:45,960
♫Can't distinguish night from day♫

211
00:21:46,740 --> 00:21:49,380
♫The world echoes with a single sigh♫

212
00:21:49,530 --> 00:21:51,930
♫Love and hate each fills half the heart♫

213
00:21:52,300 --> 00:21:53,310
♫Don't forget♫

214
00:21:53,650 --> 00:21:57,400
♫The unforgotten past♫

215
00:21:57,450 --> 00:22:02,610
♫Who saw the young man in beautiful clothes♫

216
00:22:03,030 --> 00:22:08,120
With staggering steps but not asking about tomorrow

217
00:22:08,670 --> 00:22:11,420
If I can live a peaceful

218
00:22:09,110 --> 00:22:11,630
♫The sun beams down on the world♫

219
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:14,250
♫Put everything behind♫

220
00:22:12,500 --> 00:22:14,420
and carefree life,

221
00:22:14,530 --> 00:22:15,840
♫I see♫

222
00:22:15,880 --> 00:22:19,090
♫You're in front of me♫

223
00:22:17,950 --> 00:22:19,380
I can bear

224
00:22:19,640 --> 00:22:24,810
♫Who misses the youth gazing at the bitter sea♫

225
00:22:22,100 --> 00:22:23,620
ny pain

226
00:22:25,370 --> 00:22:30,160
♫He shouted and wanted to be heard by the world♫

227
00:22:26,190 --> 00:22:28,110
and it'd be worth enduring.

228
00:22:31,370 --> 00:22:33,890
♫The cruel debts of fate♫

229
00:22:34,100 --> 00:22:36,530
♫Are exchanged for the phrase "I'm willing"♫

230
00:22:36,890 --> 00:22:38,130
♫Wind blows in the distance♫

231
00:22:38,250 --> 00:22:42,000
♫The distant boat approaches the shore♫

232
00:22:55,170 --> 00:22:57,700
This must be where the woodcutter was killed.

233
00:22:58,500 --> 00:22:59,930
The smell of sulfur is so strong.

234
00:22:59,930 --> 00:23:01,190
It's definitely here.

235
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:04,190
Who is it?

236
00:23:09,350 --> 00:23:10,530
Mr. Zhuo?

237
00:23:10,570 --> 00:23:11,790
Why are you here?

238
00:23:13,670 --> 00:23:15,000
I had to relieve myself.

239
00:23:16,380 --> 00:23:17,290
I understand.

240
00:23:20,170 --> 00:23:21,320
Nonsense.

241
00:23:21,480 --> 00:23:22,760
This smell is not right.

242
00:23:22,760 --> 00:23:24,380
It smells like sulfur.

243
00:23:24,470 --> 00:23:25,750
You are Ao Yin.

244
00:23:26,110 --> 00:23:27,710
Why did you pretend to be the Goddess

245
00:23:27,710 --> 00:23:28,950
and kill the Prime Minister?

246
00:23:28,950 --> 00:23:30,740
And now, you want to pretend to be Mr. Zhuo.

247
00:23:30,740 --> 00:23:32,400
Fortunately, I'm very smart,

248
00:23:32,410 --> 00:23:33,490
quick-sighted,

249
00:23:33,680 --> 00:23:34,920
insightful,

250
00:23:34,920 --> 00:23:36,230
and handsome.

251
00:23:37,450 --> 00:23:38,250
Tell me.

252
00:23:38,900 --> 00:23:40,740
What do you want?

253
00:23:46,350 --> 00:23:47,710
Mountain God Ying Lei,

254
00:23:48,270 --> 00:23:49,310
you're amazing.

255
00:23:52,230 --> 00:23:53,570
No.

256
00:23:53,990 --> 00:23:55,680
Mr. Zhuo would only call me

257
00:23:56,230 --> 00:23:57,670
"Little Mountain God."

258
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:04,570
Stand there.

259
00:24:09,670 --> 00:24:10,820
Mr. Zhuo.

260
00:24:12,010 --> 00:24:13,820
I was the one who hurt everyone.

261
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:17,010
Thank you for giving me a chance to follow you.

262
00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:22,520
Are you scared?

263
00:24:31,330 --> 00:24:32,500
Scared?

264
00:24:36,300 --> 00:24:38,000
As long as I can save Wen,

265
00:24:38,740 --> 00:24:40,000
I'm not scared.

266
00:24:49,990 --> 00:24:51,320
Then follow me closely.

267
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:14,350
Hold it.

268
00:25:24,330 --> 00:25:25,860
I'm afraid you'll get lost.

269
00:25:42,070 --> 00:25:42,750
Who is it?

270
00:25:46,220 --> 00:25:47,180
Ying Lei!

271
00:25:47,470 --> 00:25:48,190
Are you crazy?

272
00:25:48,190 --> 00:25:49,520
Why are you fighting us?

273
00:25:50,120 --> 00:25:51,300
He's not Ying Lei.

274
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:53,720
She's Ao Yin.

275
00:25:57,330 --> 00:25:58,130
Stop!

276
00:25:58,910 --> 00:25:59,750
Mr. Zhuo!

277
00:26:03,230 --> 00:26:04,710
Brother Zhuo, slow down!

278
00:26:04,750 --> 00:26:05,830
Wait for me.

279
00:26:06,040 --> 00:26:06,520
Hey!

280
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:07,910
Wait for me!

281
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:13,030
Watch out, Mr. Zhuo!

282
00:26:13,060 --> 00:26:14,080
She is Ao Yin.

283
00:26:14,370 --> 00:26:15,970
You are Ao Yin.

284
00:26:16,430 --> 00:26:17,730
I have the Cloud Light Sword.

285
00:26:17,730 --> 00:26:19,060
How can I be Ao Yin?

286
00:26:19,090 --> 00:26:20,180
I'm holding my kitchen knife!

287
00:26:20,180 --> 00:26:21,230
I can’t be Ao Yin!

288
00:26:21,250 --> 00:26:23,380
You can get a kitchen knife from any stall,

289
00:26:23,380 --> 00:26:25,780
but the Cloud Light Sword cannot be forged.

290
00:26:27,630 --> 00:26:29,380
That makes sense...

291
00:26:29,400 --> 00:26:31,280
What is the first constellation closest to Mount Kunlun's main door

292
00:26:31,280 --> 00:26:33,550
on the Constellation Formation Map?

293
00:26:35,400 --> 00:26:36,590
I knew it, you're Ao Yin!

294
00:26:36,590 --> 00:26:37,350
Wait.

295
00:26:37,370 --> 00:26:38,280
Wait, wait, wait.

296
00:26:38,280 --> 00:26:39,270
This question is too difficult!

297
00:26:39,270 --> 00:26:41,130
I've never been studious since I was young.

298
00:26:41,130 --> 00:26:41,730
Hmm.

299
00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:42,760
That makes sense.

300
00:26:46,440 --> 00:26:47,870
What's your dream?

301
00:26:48,040 --> 00:26:48,880
To be a cook!

302
00:26:48,980 --> 00:26:50,060
Who was

303
00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:52,540
the last witness of your beauty in your 200s?

304
00:26:52,920 --> 00:26:55,550
T-T-The mirror in Zhao Yuanzhou's house.

305
00:26:55,730 --> 00:26:56,610
That's right.

306
00:26:56,950 --> 00:26:58,360
He is Ying Lei.

307
00:26:58,510 --> 00:26:59,350
That's right.

308
00:27:00,190 --> 00:27:00,950
Wait, no.

309
00:27:00,970 --> 00:27:02,430
The first thing you shouted

310
00:27:02,430 --> 00:27:03,970
was for Mr. Zhuo to be careful.

311
00:27:03,970 --> 00:27:05,970
Why didn't you tell me to be careful?

312
00:27:05,990 --> 00:27:07,790
Do I look that despicable?

313
00:27:07,820 --> 00:27:08,370
Yep.

314
00:27:08,630 --> 00:27:09,730
It's confirmed.

315
00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:11,080
He is definitely Ying Lei.

316
00:27:11,080 --> 00:27:11,760
Yes.

317
00:27:13,960 --> 00:27:15,630
Why don't you suspect me?

318
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:17,120
You're Jiu.

319
00:27:17,480 --> 00:27:19,290
You smell of herbs.

320
00:27:20,630 --> 00:27:21,590
Mr. Zhuo,

321
00:27:21,630 --> 00:27:22,760
you can smell it too?

322
00:27:22,780 --> 00:27:23,670
Since I was young,

323
00:27:23,670 --> 00:27:25,480
I've loved the smell of herbs

324
00:27:26,380 --> 00:27:27,720
because it made me feel

325
00:27:27,870 --> 00:27:28,850
calm

326
00:27:28,910 --> 00:27:29,770
and reassured.

327
00:27:31,470 --> 00:27:33,140
I also like the smell of herbs

328
00:27:33,390 --> 00:27:35,900
and garlic,

329
00:27:36,410 --> 00:27:37,950
onion, green pepper,

330
00:27:38,030 --> 00:27:39,110
vegetables, carrots,

331
00:27:39,110 --> 00:27:39,870
turnips,

332
00:27:39,870 --> 00:27:41,530
and...

333
00:27:41,630 --> 00:27:42,550
Coriander smells good too.

334
00:27:42,550 --> 00:27:43,450
What's wrong with him?

335
00:27:43,450 --> 00:27:45,650
Actually, potatoes are not bad either.

336
00:27:50,170 --> 00:27:51,090
Jiu!

337
00:28:35,420 --> 00:28:36,540
You said

338
00:28:36,970 --> 00:28:40,630
you suspect someone instructed the murderer to commit the crime.

339
00:28:40,760 --> 00:28:41,940
Yes.

340
00:28:43,430 --> 00:28:45,940
They framed me at this time,

341
00:28:46,390 --> 00:28:47,670
probably to stop me

342
00:28:47,690 --> 00:28:49,490
from repairing the Baize Token.

343
00:28:51,310 --> 00:28:53,080
This case is full of loopholes.

344
00:28:53,310 --> 00:28:56,070
The investigation procedure was a mess.

345
00:28:56,560 --> 00:28:58,130
Do you have any idea

346
00:28:58,540 --> 00:28:59,650
who ordered this?

347
00:29:02,350 --> 00:29:03,400
Wen Zongyu.

348
00:29:08,140 --> 00:29:09,280
But

349
00:29:09,430 --> 00:29:12,110
the Prime Minister was obviously killed by a demon.

350
00:29:12,110 --> 00:29:13,980
Wen Zongyu is a mortal.

351
00:29:14,040 --> 00:29:16,370
How could he make a demon obey him?

352
00:29:18,990 --> 00:29:19,930
You're right.

353
00:29:38,380 --> 00:29:39,370
Previously,

354
00:29:39,750 --> 00:29:41,550
in the illusion of Li Lun,

355
00:29:42,040 --> 00:29:43,110
I saw a female demon

356
00:29:43,110 --> 00:29:44,870
who looked exactly like you.

357
00:29:46,750 --> 00:29:48,950
She seemed to be a subordinate of Li Lun.

358
00:29:50,030 --> 00:29:50,910
Li Lun?

359
00:29:52,200 --> 00:29:52,840
Yes.

360
00:29:55,220 --> 00:29:57,090
But Li Lun is dead.

361
00:29:58,400 --> 00:30:00,000
He burned to ashes

362
00:30:00,350 --> 00:30:01,650
in front of you.

363
00:30:04,390 --> 00:30:05,970
But at that time,

364
00:30:07,170 --> 00:30:09,870
we couldn't find Li Lun's inner core.

365
00:30:11,090 --> 00:30:12,810
Is Li Lun really dead?

366
00:30:16,370 --> 00:30:18,500
Why don't we see his inner core?

367
00:30:19,330 --> 00:30:20,750
The Ever-Burning Wood

368
00:30:21,650 --> 00:30:23,370
is the king of fire.

369
00:30:24,340 --> 00:30:26,070
It can burn everything.

370
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:28,360
I'm afraid even the inner core

371
00:30:28,390 --> 00:30:29,920
was unable to be preserved.

372
00:30:36,930 --> 00:30:38,370
You mean

373
00:30:39,640 --> 00:30:41,060
Li Lun is not dead?

374
00:30:50,310 --> 00:30:52,190
Pei Sijing, someone wants to see you.

375
00:30:52,190 --> 00:30:52,870
Who?

376
00:30:53,110 --> 00:30:54,310
Why do you ask so much?

377
00:31:00,630 --> 00:31:01,900
Sister Pei.

378
00:31:01,930 --> 00:31:02,930
It's okay.

379
00:31:03,030 --> 00:31:04,230
You be careful.

380
00:31:24,230 --> 00:31:25,490
Ao Yin

381
00:31:28,620 --> 00:31:30,830
can transform at will?

382
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:32,900
That's difficult to deal with.

383
00:31:32,900 --> 00:31:34,060
If she

384
00:31:34,080 --> 00:31:35,420
finds out our secrets

385
00:31:35,450 --> 00:31:36,470
and habits,

386
00:31:36,770 --> 00:31:38,900
won't it be harder to distinguish her?

387
00:31:39,040 --> 00:31:39,900
Yes.

388
00:31:40,140 --> 00:31:41,830
She's extremely fast.

389
00:31:41,860 --> 00:31:43,120
It's hard to catch her.

390
00:31:44,440 --> 00:31:45,730
The forest is spacious

391
00:31:45,760 --> 00:31:47,020
and humid.

392
00:31:47,210 --> 00:31:48,390
The smell of sulfur

393
00:31:48,410 --> 00:31:50,070
has become too faint to trace.

394
00:31:51,270 --> 00:31:53,140
Based on her lifestyle,

395
00:31:53,390 --> 00:31:55,190
where would she typically hide?

396
00:31:57,640 --> 00:31:58,590
Now is the time

397
00:31:59,070 --> 00:32:00,830
for me, the little Mountain God,

398
00:32:00,830 --> 00:32:02,990
to turn the tide.

399
00:32:04,690 --> 00:32:06,330
When Ao Yin ran away,

400
00:32:06,590 --> 00:32:07,890
I sprinkled

401
00:32:07,920 --> 00:32:10,160
my special spice on her.

402
00:32:10,700 --> 00:32:11,680
The smell is unique.

403
00:32:11,680 --> 00:32:12,740
It's easy to track.

404
00:32:14,660 --> 00:32:15,440
But

405
00:32:15,470 --> 00:32:17,670
Mr. Zhuo said she's extremely fast.

406
00:32:17,690 --> 00:32:19,110
Even if we track her down,

407
00:32:19,140 --> 00:32:20,740
it'll be hard to capture her.

408
00:32:20,830 --> 00:32:22,600
Then just continue to sprinkle spices.

409
00:32:22,600 --> 00:32:24,220
Don't you have another type of spice?

410
00:32:24,220 --> 00:32:24,790
Spice?

411
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:27,000
Huanling Powder?

412
00:32:27,910 --> 00:32:28,550
Yes.

413
00:32:28,710 --> 00:32:29,230
I have plenty

414
00:32:29,230 --> 00:32:30,460
of Huanling Powder.

415
00:32:30,570 --> 00:32:32,620
But to deal with Ao Yin,

416
00:32:33,010 --> 00:32:34,340
it doesn't seem enough.

417
00:32:35,450 --> 00:32:36,380
What do you need?

418
00:32:39,620 --> 00:32:40,410
That thing?

419
00:32:41,560 --> 00:32:42,540
I got it.

420
00:32:42,750 --> 00:32:45,080
We're missing Kusnezoff Monkshood Root.

421
00:32:45,380 --> 00:32:46,570
Kusnezoff Monkshood Root?

422
00:32:46,570 --> 00:32:48,030
Kusnezoff Monkshood Root

423
00:32:48,050 --> 00:32:49,250
can paralyze people.

424
00:32:49,260 --> 00:32:50,690
It also works on demons.

425
00:32:50,710 --> 00:32:52,700
It can greatly slow Ao Yin down.

426
00:32:55,790 --> 00:32:56,590
Mr. Zhuo,

427
00:32:56,830 --> 00:32:58,180
aren't I amazing?

428
00:32:59,620 --> 00:33:00,850
You're amazing.

429
00:33:00,990 --> 00:33:03,250
You're indeed the best doctor in Tiandu.

430
00:33:07,290 --> 00:33:09,100
One-Word Spell.

431
00:33:09,560 --> 00:33:11,040
Endure.

432
00:33:20,620 --> 00:33:23,350
Zhen Mei was seriously injured by Zhao Yuanzhou.

433
00:33:23,350 --> 00:33:25,410
It's unknown whether he'll survive.

434
00:33:26,490 --> 00:33:28,770
Once his position becomes vacant,

435
00:33:30,820 --> 00:33:33,920
I hope you, Ms. Pei, can replace him.

436
00:33:35,450 --> 00:33:38,250
Replace him and continue to be your shield?

437
00:33:39,410 --> 00:33:40,900
Why do you think

438
00:33:40,920 --> 00:33:42,750
everyone in the world

439
00:33:43,210 --> 00:33:45,040
is willing to die for you?

440
00:33:47,680 --> 00:33:49,740
Chaos in the Wilderness is imminent.

441
00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:52,950
Demons will swarm here

442
00:33:53,030 --> 00:33:55,000
and take over the mortal world.

443
00:33:55,710 --> 00:33:58,490
Your brother was killed by a demon.

444
00:33:58,910 --> 00:34:01,610
I can relate to this painful experience.

445
00:34:02,090 --> 00:34:04,260
Logically, both of us should

446
00:34:04,510 --> 00:34:07,020
hate demons viciously.

447
00:34:08,560 --> 00:34:10,780
You said you can relate to me

448
00:34:10,810 --> 00:34:12,570
and hate demons to the bone.

449
00:34:14,370 --> 00:34:15,480
Could it be

450
00:34:16,389 --> 00:34:18,120
that an important person to you

451
00:34:18,630 --> 00:34:20,370
was also killed by a demon?

452
00:34:23,630 --> 00:34:25,130
You don't need to ask.

453
00:34:26,870 --> 00:34:29,040
I heard about your rumors before.

454
00:34:29,420 --> 00:34:31,679
You joined Chongwu Camp ten years ago

455
00:34:32,340 --> 00:34:34,409
and were just an ordinary soldier.

456
00:34:36,150 --> 00:34:37,830
But in a short decade,

457
00:34:38,500 --> 00:34:40,130
you rose through the ranks

458
00:34:40,389 --> 00:34:42,219
and became the advisor.

459
00:34:42,550 --> 00:34:44,230
Everyone was puzzled.

460
00:34:46,540 --> 00:34:48,449
That's due to my abilities.

461
00:34:48,590 --> 00:34:50,239
I contributed too much.

462
00:34:50,750 --> 00:34:52,790
I just kept a low profile

463
00:34:52,929 --> 00:34:55,190
and didn't want to show off to the others.

464
00:34:55,710 --> 00:34:58,510
That's because you've done too many dirty things

465
00:34:58,530 --> 00:35:00,260
and you can't see the light.

466
00:35:01,030 --> 00:35:02,630
Zhen Mei is just your puppet.

467
00:35:02,630 --> 00:35:03,590
Zhen Mei

468
00:35:04,420 --> 00:35:05,770
is an orphan.

469
00:35:05,790 --> 00:35:08,240
I adopted him.

470
00:35:08,470 --> 00:35:10,480
Of course he's obedient to me.

471
00:35:12,430 --> 00:35:14,430
But you are so heartless.

472
00:35:15,830 --> 00:35:17,370
In order to save you,

473
00:35:17,500 --> 00:35:18,710
Zhen Mei was heavily injured

474
00:35:18,710 --> 00:35:20,290
and it's uncertain if he'll survive.

475
00:35:20,290 --> 00:35:21,520
And now,

476
00:35:21,630 --> 00:35:23,580
you are using his official position

477
00:35:23,580 --> 00:35:25,170
to negotiate with me.

478
00:35:26,430 --> 00:35:28,030
It seems that

479
00:35:30,320 --> 00:35:31,600
you don't agree.

480
00:35:48,430 --> 00:35:49,730
If you agree,

481
00:35:49,990 --> 00:35:51,270
you can live

482
00:35:51,270 --> 00:35:53,400
and be the commander of Chongwu Camp.

483
00:35:54,340 --> 00:35:55,720
If you refuse,

484
00:35:56,380 --> 00:35:58,150
you have to die

485
00:35:58,470 --> 00:36:00,590
and become food for demons.

486
00:36:01,060 --> 00:36:02,070
It's your choice.

487
00:36:25,070 --> 00:36:25,950
Are you okay?

488
00:36:28,670 --> 00:36:29,710
I’m fine.

489
00:36:34,900 --> 00:36:36,480
Is it the advisor?

490
00:36:37,270 --> 00:36:38,070
Yes.

491
00:36:39,030 --> 00:36:40,390
He is scheming

492
00:36:40,420 --> 00:36:41,740
and vicious.

493
00:36:41,830 --> 00:36:42,790
I'm worried that...

494
00:36:42,790 --> 00:36:44,390
You have no confidence in me?

495
00:36:47,010 --> 00:36:49,470
It's not that I don't have confidence in you.

496
00:36:49,930 --> 00:36:51,990
I just can't make up my mind.

497
00:36:52,950 --> 00:36:54,890
The food will be delivered soon.

498
00:36:55,470 --> 00:36:56,970
I wondered if I should wait for you

499
00:36:56,970 --> 00:36:58,400
to eat it or not?

500
00:37:01,190 --> 00:37:02,280
What?

501
00:37:02,950 --> 00:37:05,030
You need someone for company

502
00:37:05,440 --> 00:37:07,300
to eat a bun and a bowl of rice soup?

503
00:37:08,920 --> 00:37:10,190
Just going with the flow

504
00:37:10,190 --> 00:37:11,720
and finding joy in the pain.

505
00:37:14,190 --> 00:37:15,850
With a best friend's company,

506
00:37:16,190 --> 00:37:17,670
even bland soup is a feast.

507
00:37:19,010 --> 00:37:20,800
Being alone,

508
00:37:21,300 --> 00:37:22,560
even golden goblets

509
00:37:22,660 --> 00:37:23,950
are superficial.

510
00:37:31,740 --> 00:37:33,040
So pretentious.

511
00:37:33,070 --> 00:37:35,070
Did you learn it from Zhao Yuanzhou?

512
00:37:35,960 --> 00:37:37,170
Thank you, Sister.

513
00:37:57,430 --> 00:38:00,310
You even changed your clothes.

514
00:38:00,530 --> 00:38:01,790
What do you know?

515
00:38:08,490 --> 00:38:09,490
The smell of spices

516
00:38:09,490 --> 00:38:10,830
ends here.

517
00:38:11,350 --> 00:38:12,510
She must be inside.

518
00:38:18,790 --> 00:38:19,650
How old are you?

519
00:38:19,660 --> 00:38:20,740
Shameless!

520
00:38:32,510 --> 00:38:33,310
Ying Lei,

521
00:38:34,100 --> 00:38:35,440
are you sure?

522
00:38:36,030 --> 00:38:37,740
Do you know what this place is?

523
00:38:37,760 --> 00:38:39,820
It looks fun.

524
00:38:41,990 --> 00:38:44,710
It's a place you kids shouldn't come.

525
00:38:46,150 --> 00:38:47,490
Goodness.

526
00:38:48,530 --> 00:38:50,790
I'm 237 years and 3 months old.

527
00:38:50,790 --> 00:38:51,830
Mr. Zhuo,

528
00:38:51,830 --> 00:38:53,760
may I ask what age you are this year?

529
00:38:54,280 --> 00:38:55,200
Twenty-four.

530
00:38:56,600 --> 00:38:57,660
Nominal age.

531
00:39:00,870 --> 00:39:02,530
The smell of rouge here is heavy.

532
00:39:02,530 --> 00:39:04,660
In order to cover up her scent,

533
00:39:04,750 --> 00:39:07,280
Ao Yin might choose to hide here.

534
00:39:07,320 --> 00:39:08,950
Then why didn’t she choose

535
00:39:08,950 --> 00:39:10,890
the garbage pile of the underground sewer?

536
00:39:10,890 --> 00:39:12,940
It could've been a better cover.

537
00:39:13,820 --> 00:39:14,700
Right.

538
00:39:14,930 --> 00:39:17,000
Ao Yin is a girl after all.

539
00:39:17,990 --> 00:39:18,550
My grandpa said…

540
00:39:18,550 --> 00:39:19,150
All right.

541
00:39:19,790 --> 00:39:20,980
If you want to continue chatting,

542
00:39:20,980 --> 00:39:22,140
stay here.

543
00:39:22,670 --> 00:39:23,430
If you want to investigate,

544
00:39:23,430 --> 00:39:24,980
shut up and come in with me.

545
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:26,490
Mr. Zhuo.

546
00:39:28,190 --> 00:39:30,120
I have one more thing to remind you.

547
00:39:30,230 --> 00:39:30,790
Ao Yin

548
00:39:31,050 --> 00:39:33,220
is not only fast and agile.

549
00:39:33,310 --> 00:39:34,000
Her voice

550
00:39:34,350 --> 00:39:36,170
can also be hypnotic.

551
00:39:36,260 --> 00:39:37,020
Remember.

552
00:39:37,040 --> 00:39:39,030
Don't be brainwashed

553
00:39:39,060 --> 00:39:40,470
by her sweet words.

554
00:39:41,600 --> 00:39:42,600
Hey!

555
00:39:44,020 --> 00:39:46,080
Don't you listen to Mr. Zhuo the most?

556
00:39:46,660 --> 00:39:47,400
He said

557
00:39:47,820 --> 00:39:50,130
this is not a place for kids.

558
00:39:50,350 --> 00:39:51,910
What if Ao Yin is really in there?

559
00:39:51,910 --> 00:39:53,780
It might be dangerous there.

560
00:39:54,180 --> 00:39:55,260
Wait here.

561
00:39:56,190 --> 00:39:56,840
Okay.

562
00:40:03,320 --> 00:40:04,580
You're this obedient?

563
00:40:17,960 --> 00:40:25,570
[Tianxiang Pavilion]

564
00:40:26,380 --> 00:40:28,060
Sir, come and play.

565
00:40:28,150 --> 00:40:31,280
Isn't this the dream man of thousands of girls of Tiandu?

566
00:40:31,290 --> 00:40:32,870
It's really Mr. Zhuo Yichen.

567
00:40:32,870 --> 00:40:34,380
What brings him here?

568
00:40:34,420 --> 00:40:35,220
I...

569
00:40:35,540 --> 00:40:36,670
Am I drunk?

570
00:40:40,870 --> 00:40:42,200
Zhuo Yichen.

571
00:40:42,440 --> 00:40:44,100
Girls, come here.

572
00:40:44,190 --> 00:40:46,830
Zhuo Yichen has come to Tianxiang Pavilion!

573
00:40:47,260 --> 00:40:48,670
Don't... Don't shout.

574
00:40:48,670 --> 00:40:49,710
I'm not here for fun.

575
00:40:49,710 --> 00:40:51,110
I'm looking for someone.

576
00:40:51,150 --> 00:40:52,140
I understand.

577
00:40:52,230 --> 00:40:53,980
Keep a low profile.

578
00:40:54,230 --> 00:40:56,950
Girls, our chance to get rich is right before our eyes!

579
00:40:56,950 --> 00:40:57,840
Come here.

580
00:40:57,840 --> 00:40:58,790
Come here!

581
00:40:58,910 --> 00:41:01,150
Mr. Zhuo is looking for someone.

582
00:41:02,550 --> 00:41:05,340
You're good at everything.

583
00:41:05,360 --> 00:41:08,170
You're as handsome as the legends say,

584
00:41:08,200 --> 00:41:10,060
with your fair skin and red lips.

585
00:41:12,230 --> 00:41:13,070
Mr. Zhuo.

586
00:41:13,090 --> 00:41:14,200
Brother!

587
00:41:15,590 --> 00:41:16,740
Jiu.

588
00:41:20,070 --> 00:41:20,910
Jiu.

589
00:41:20,930 --> 00:41:22,310
Thank goodness you're here.

590
00:41:22,310 --> 00:41:22,910
No biggie.

591
00:41:22,930 --> 00:41:23,970
Why are you here?

592
00:41:25,110 --> 00:41:25,890
If it weren't for me,

593
00:41:25,890 --> 00:41:27,440
I'm telling you…

594
00:41:29,480 --> 00:41:30,610
If it weren't for me,

595
00:41:30,620 --> 00:41:31,610
you...

596
00:41:32,830 --> 00:41:33,630
What's wrong?

597
00:41:35,810 --> 00:41:37,280
It smells like my spices.

598
00:41:39,670 --> 00:41:41,580
Is that the dancer?

599
00:41:48,940 --> 00:41:50,100
I'm not sure.

600
00:41:51,320 --> 00:41:52,760
The smell is gone.

601
00:41:54,500 --> 00:41:55,550
Keep looking.

602
00:42:15,450 --> 00:42:16,250
It's her.

603
00:42:21,270 --> 00:42:22,450
Let's split up.

604
00:42:22,480 --> 00:42:23,570
Surround her.

605
00:42:23,830 --> 00:42:24,500
Okay.

606
00:42:24,920 --> 00:42:25,220
Let's go.

607
00:42:25,220 --> 00:42:25,760
Let's go.

608
00:42:33,870 --> 00:42:35,050
Miss.

609
00:42:40,120 --> 00:42:41,290
Miss, please wait.

610
00:42:43,840 --> 00:42:44,640
Miss!

611
00:42:50,930 --> 00:42:51,730
Miss.

612
00:42:52,020 --> 00:42:53,220
I'm sorry.

613
00:43:14,760 --> 00:43:15,390
She's getting away!

614
00:43:15,390 --> 00:43:16,310
Brat,

615
00:43:16,340 --> 00:43:18,210
what did you sprinkle on me?

616
00:43:18,960 --> 00:43:20,770
Why am I running so slow?

617
00:43:20,790 --> 00:43:22,010
Stop!

618
00:43:22,390 --> 00:43:23,200
Don't move!

619
00:43:23,230 --> 00:43:23,860
Stop!

620
00:43:23,890 --> 00:43:25,080
Stop!

621
00:43:25,330 --> 00:43:26,050
Come back!

622
00:43:26,940 --> 00:43:27,930
Oh my.

623
00:43:27,950 --> 00:43:28,880
Sister Pei.

624
00:43:28,990 --> 00:43:29,650
Why is it you?

625
00:43:29,650 --> 00:43:31,000
How dare you ask me?

626
00:43:31,030 --> 00:43:33,400
We ended up like this because you were

627
00:43:33,510 --> 00:43:34,710
a spy from Chongwu Camp.

628
00:43:34,710 --> 00:43:35,270
I'm sorry.

629
00:43:35,270 --> 00:43:35,930
Sister Pei,

630
00:43:35,930 --> 00:43:36,840
I was wrong.

631
00:43:36,950 --> 00:43:38,150
Sister Pei, you're injured.

632
00:43:38,150 --> 00:43:39,370
Liar!

633
00:43:39,990 --> 00:43:41,170
Traitor!

634
00:43:43,310 --> 00:43:43,870
You...

635
00:43:43,950 --> 00:43:45,470
You are not Pei Sijing!

636
00:43:45,550 --> 00:43:46,810
You are Ao Yin!

637
00:43:46,870 --> 00:43:47,390
You...

638
00:43:47,390 --> 00:43:48,170
Stop!

639
00:43:51,550 --> 00:43:52,820
How dare a minor demon

640
00:43:52,860 --> 00:43:55,270
get in my way?

641
00:43:57,060 --> 00:43:58,510
I'll leave immediately.

642
00:43:58,630 --> 00:44:00,070
I'm going back to the Wilderness.

643
00:44:00,070 --> 00:44:01,630
I'll take him away too.

644
00:44:13,090 --> 00:44:13,730
Wen Xiao?

645
00:44:13,760 --> 00:44:14,520
Zhuo,

646
00:44:14,540 --> 00:44:15,900
it's me.

647
00:44:25,810 --> 00:44:26,530
No.

648
00:44:28,010 --> 00:44:28,610
Zhuo,

649
00:44:28,640 --> 00:44:29,630
look at me.

650
00:44:30,030 --> 00:44:30,910
Look at me.

651
00:44:31,800 --> 00:44:32,560
Shameless!

652
00:44:40,070 --> 00:44:41,380
Zhuo.

653
00:44:43,480 --> 00:44:45,690
Why are you pointing a sword at me?

654
00:44:49,960 --> 00:44:51,000
Zhuo,

655
00:44:52,110 --> 00:44:53,720
I'm Wen Xiao.

656
00:44:54,830 --> 00:44:56,130
Wen Xiao.

657
00:44:56,770 --> 00:44:58,480
Don't you love me?

658
00:45:05,160 --> 00:45:06,290
Zhuo?

659
00:45:08,750 --> 00:45:09,750
Zhuo!

660
00:45:15,610 --> 00:45:17,120
Zhuo.
