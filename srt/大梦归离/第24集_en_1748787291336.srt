1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,700
arrives and hä

2
00:00:21,400 --> 00:00:21,940
체

3
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:05,000
I'm sorry, but I'm not sure if I can get the best of you.

4
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:10,000
I'm sorry, but I'm not sure if I can get the best of you.

5
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:15,000
I'm sorry, but I'm not sure if I can get the best of you.

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:20,000
I'm sorry, but I'm not sure if I can get the best of you.

7
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:25,000
I'm sorry, but I'm not sure if I can get the best of you.

8
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:30,000
I'm sorry, but I'm not sure if you can get the best of me.

9
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,000
I'm sorry, but I'm not sure if I can get the best of you.

10
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Stand up.

11
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Speak our language.

12
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
I'm not sure if I can get through this.

13
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
I'm just going to try to get through this.

14
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
I'm just going to try to get through this.

15
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
I'm just going to try to get through this.

16
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
I'm just going to try to get through this.

17
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
I'm just going to try to get through this.

18
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
I'm just going to try to get through this.

19
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
I'm just going to try to get through this.

20
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
I'm just going to try to get through this.

21
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
I'm just going to try to get through this.

22
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
I'm just going to try to get through this.

23
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
I'm just going to try to get through this.

24
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
I'm just going to try to get through this.

25
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
I'm just going to try to get through this.

26
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
I'm just going to try to get through this.

27
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
I'm just going to try to get through this.

28
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
I'm just going to try to go through this.

29
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
I'm just going to try to get through this.

30
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
I'm just going to try to get through this.

31
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
I'm just going to take out that scar.

32
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
I'm just going to try to get through this.

33
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
I'm just going to take out the scar.

34
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
I'm just going to try to get through this.

35
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
After I get through this, I'm going to try to get through this.

36
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
I'm just going to try to get through this.

37
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
I've finally here you.

38
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
You can also cut my hand.

39
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
You can also cut my hand.

40
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Don't you feel the burning pain of the chest?

41
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
What did you do to me?

42
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,000
No matter if it's human or demon,

43
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
poison is always the most useful weapon.

44
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:22,000
If you want to live, you have to be obedient.

45
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:28,000
I will never accept the human.

46
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Is that so?

47
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Doctor Liu has come to see you.

48
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:54,000
He said Xiao Zhuo was seriously injured.

49
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
His life is in danger.

50
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
He can't find the evidence.

51
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
He can only use the medicine first.

52
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
He needs to be executed every day.

53
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
There are many people who are sick.

54
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000
I can't help you.

55
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
I can't help you.

56
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
I can't help you.

57
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
I can't help you.

58
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
I'm sorry.

59
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
There are many people who are sick.

60
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
They can be killed by the light arrow.

61
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:26,000
The person who is killed by the light arrow will be killed with the sword.

62
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:33,000
The light arrow will become his life-threatening weapon.

63
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Life-threatening weapon?

64
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:41,000
It's the sword that makes life-threatening weapons.

65
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:47,000
The sword that destroys the human.

66
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:55,000
So this is Xiao Zhuo's fate?

67
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Because of my strength and time.

68
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
I have to leave the camp first.

69
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Otherwise, I will lose my power.

70
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
I will be in danger.

71
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Xiao Zhuo tried his best to save me.

72
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:30,000
But I killed him.

73
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Xiao Zhuo is a good person.

74
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
He is a good person.

75
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
He is a good person.

76
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
He is a good person.

77
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
He is a good person.

78
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
He is a good person.

79
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
He is a good person.

80
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
He is a good person.

81
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
He is a good person.

82
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
He is a good person.

83
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:11,000
If Xiaojiu is here, he will have a way.

84
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Yes.

85
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Xiaojiu is the most famous little spirit in the world.

86
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
He cured many people.

87
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Mr. Pei.

88
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Do you think Xiaojiu will become the original Xiaojiu?

89
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:41,000
I will take back Xiaojiu from the theory.

90
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Mr. Lu.

91
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:05,000
Why don't we ask Mr. Lu?

92
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
There is a lot of strange plants on Mount Kunlun.

93
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:11,000
Maybe Mr. Lu can help Mr. Xiaojiu.

94
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Or we can change the name to Baijiu.

95
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Let's go.

96
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,000
Let's go.

97
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:27,000
The spirit in the theory is strong.

98
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:31,000
It is hard to get rid of it.

99
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
Is there any magic in it?

100
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Yes.

101
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,000
We need to cooperate with the people.

102
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:43,000
We need to use the light to help the spirit.

103
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
We need to cooperate with the people.

104
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
We need to cooperate with the people.

105
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:52,000
We need to use the light to help the spirit.

106
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,000
The light?

107
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Mr. Chuo.

108
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:03,000
But I heard that the light is broken.

109
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Mr. Lu.

110
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
Xiaojiu is unconscious.

111
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Is there any way to save him?

112
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,000
He is a good person.

113
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:18,000
He can help him to save his life.

114
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,000
Gui.

115
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
Okay. I understand.

116
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Mr. Pei.

117
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,000
I will send you back.

118
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,000
I will go with you.

119
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,000
No, no, no.

120
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:34,000
The dead bodies are in the dark sea.

121
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
And they are all cold.

122
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,000
And there are devils.

123
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,000
Since it is so dangerous,

124
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
I can't let you go alone.

125
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
You are injured.

126
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,000
Let me go.

127
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
You are so careless.

128
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,000
And the monsters are all the same.

129
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,000
Let me go.

130
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
I will be the one to blame.

131
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:55,000
Mr. Chuo is the most favored person in Xiaojiu.

132
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,000
I must save him.

133
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,000
You stay here.

134
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,000
I will go with you.

135
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,000
Mr. Chuo will need you.

136
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,000
Teacher.

137
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,000
I am back.

138
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,000
How do you feel?

139
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:24,000
Thank you for your care.

140
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,000
I feel better now

141
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:30,000
than before.

142
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,000
Inform the commandant.

143
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,000
According to the scout,

144
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
Zuo Yichen of Ji14 is about to die.

145
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:42,000
Only Zuo Yichen can kill Zhao Yanzhou now.

146
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,000
I will go with you.

147
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,000
I will go with you.

148
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,000
I will go with you.

149
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,000
I will go with you.

150
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,000
I will go with you.

151
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,000
I will go with you.

152
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,000
I will go with you.

153
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,000
I will go with you.

154
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,000
I will go with you.

155
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,000
I will go with you.

156
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
I have killed Zhao Yanzhou.

157
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,000
I won't die.

158
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,000
What's wrong with you?

159
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,000
I have had a headache.

160
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,000
A headache?

161
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
It's the Clouds.

162
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:38,000
The primordial spirit that can take me away from the white wine.

163
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:44,000
It's the only thing that I can do now.

164
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,000
But the Clouds...

165
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
Are they already destroyed?

166
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
If the Clouds can't be repaired,

167
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
Xiao Zhuo will keep falling down.

168
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
Until the light of the bitter has gone.

169
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
Then how do I convince the Clouds?

170
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
The Clouds can be destroyed.

171
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
They can be repaired.

172
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
I'll stop them.

173
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,000
No.

174
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
I have a better way.

175
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
The Clouds

176
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
Brother, you're so good.

177
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:44,000
That sword move was so good.

178
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
The Clouds

179
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,000
It's a pity.

180
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
The Clouds in my hand

181
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:59,000
can only turn the world upside down.

182
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
I can't change it.

183
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,000
Change it?

184
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
How can I change it?

185
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
The Clouds after the awakening

186
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:13,000
can be heard and move the world.

187
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:17,000
As long as I'm strong enough to see the people.

188
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
The Clouds can see themselves.

189
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
Brother is so good.

190
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
I'm sure I can't hope.

191
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,000
I have confidence in myself.

192
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
When you grow up,

193
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
you'll be better than me.

194
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
I'll try my best to catch you.

195
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,000
Okay.

196
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:07,000
But I'll go out with my father later.

197
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,000
I'll catch a big demon.

198
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,000
When I come back,

199
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:15,000
I'll give you the sword move.

200
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,000
Okay?

201
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,000
You're right.

202
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,000
The Clouds

203
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,000
The Clouds

204
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,000
Where's my brother?

205
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,000
Speak.

206
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,000
Where's my brother?

207
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
The Clouds

208
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,000
Brother.

209
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,000
I've been talking about this for so many years.

210
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:41,000
I'm sure we'll be together.

211
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,000
Brother.

212
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:03,000
I'll get the task of the Clouds.

213
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:06,000
I'll learn the sword move you haven't come yet.

214
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,000
I'll catch you and father.

215
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,000
I still can't.

216
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,000
Brother.

217
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,000
How can I become a wall?

218
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,000
How can I get revenge for you and father?

219
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,000
The Clouds

220
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:40,000
The Clouds

221
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,000
The Clouds

222
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:24,000
I'm sorry.

223
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,000
I'm sorry.

224
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,000
Zhuang.

225
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,000
Zhuang.

226
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,000
The Clouds

227
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,000
The Clouds

228
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,000
The Clouds

229
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,000
Zhuang.

230
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,000
Zhuang.

231
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:00,000
Zhuang.

232
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:02,000
Zhuang.

233
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,000
Zhuang.

234
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,000
Zhuang.

235
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,000
Zhuang.

236
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,000
Zhuang.

237
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,000
Ah...

238
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,000
Ah...

239
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,000
Ah...

240
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,000
Ah...

241
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,000
Ah...

242
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:49,000
Ah...

243
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,000
Ah...

244
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,000
Ah...

245
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,000
Ah...

246
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,000
Ah...

247
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,000
Ah...

248
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,000
What is this?

249
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:05,000
This is the secret treasure of the World of Ice.

250
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,000
The Five-colored Stone.

251
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:13,000
The Five-colored Stone used by the Queen of the Year.

252
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:19,000
But why did the Five-colored Stone appear in the Water of the Four Seasons?

253
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:22,000
The Four Seasons used to be the Zuo Manor.

254
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:25,000
The Zuo Family's identity was hidden in the Five-colored Stone.

255
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,000
The Five-colored Stone can be used to make the Heavens.

256
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:29,000
It can be used to repair the Wanwo.

257
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:33,000
So I guess...

258
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:37,000
The Five-colored Stone was able to win the Cloudlight Sword.

259
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,000
That's why it appeared.

260
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,000
Chen Hao.

261
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,000
Chen Hao.

262
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,000
Xiao Chou is saved.

263
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,000
The Five-colored Stone.

264
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,000
Xiao Chou.

265
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,000
Yuen Wen.

266
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,000
You must be so quick to kill.

267
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,000
You can't let Xiao Chou go.

268
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,000
What about me?

269
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:33,000
Who is going to let me go?

270
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:37,000
Chou Yichen and Bai Jiu are my friends.

271
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:39,000
I must save them.

272
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,000
I used to be your friend.

273
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,000
I used to be your friend.

274
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,000
I used to be your friend.

275
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,000
I used to be your friend.

276
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:49,000
I used to be your friend.

277
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,000
I used to be your friend.

278
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,000
I don't want to be like this.

279
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,000
You killed yourself.

280
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:01,000
You don't want to.

281
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:03,000
But you still did it.

282
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,000
You did something wrong.

283
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:09,000
You sacrificed Xiao Chou.

284
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,000
You took away her body.

285
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,000
I will never do anything wrong.

286
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,000
Right?

287
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,000
I will wait.

288
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:47,000
The Five-colored Stone.

289
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:49,000
I didn't get taken away by the theory.

290
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:17,000
It's the tree soup of the theory.

291
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:23,000
The demon of the theory is gone.

292
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:47,000
Xiao Chou.

293
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:53,000
Xiao Chou.

294
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:55,000
Xiao Chou.

295
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:57,000
Xiao Chou.

296
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:59,000
Xiao Chou.

297
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:01,000
Xiao Chou.

298
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:03,000
Hold on.

299
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:05,000
Hold on.

300
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:07,000
Hold on.

301
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:09,000
Hold on.

302
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:13,000
You're not going to let the people understand this by now.

303
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:18,000
If it's the Heavenly Emperor, I will die without regrets.

304
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:21,000
Yinglong, you have no regrets.

305
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:24,000
But have you ever thought about my feelings?

306
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:28,000
Binyi.

307
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:45,000
Binyi.

308
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:02,000
I know.

309
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:07,000
The reason is not to steal the Wusashi.

310
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:09,000
Then what does he want?

311
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,000
He wants to sell the Wusashi

312
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:17,000
and become a demon.

313
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:27,000
Gui Mu, Gui Mu, I brought it back.

314
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:31,000
Xiaoliu, what's going on?

315
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:00,000
The little beast has captured Gui Mu.

316
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:04,000
Lu Dangan said that Gui Mu could temporarily kill a little beast.

317
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,000
It takes a little time.

318
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:21,000
Why are you so injured?

319
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:24,000
I don't want to.

320
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,000
It hurts.

321
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:28,000
It hurts?

322
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:30,000
It's all some external injuries.

323
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:33,000
But what's the problem?

324
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:34,000
I'll go with you.

325
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:35,000
No, no, no.

326
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:38,000
Gui Mu is between the Black Flames of the Great Wilderness and the Sea.

327
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:40,000
And the animals are all cold-blooded.

328
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:41,000
And there are food and clothing.

329
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:43,000
Since it's so dangerous, you're injured.

330
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:44,000
Let me go.

331
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:46,000
You don't know the Great Wilderness.

332
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:47,000
Let me go.

333
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:49,000
I will definitely go to Gui Mu.

334
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:57,000
The Great Wilderness

335
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:04,000
But I found this little beast.

336
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:06,000
I know everything.

337
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:10,000
It's useless.

338
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:13,000
You went back to Gui Mu.

339
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:15,000
And you just don't know the rules.

340
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:22,000
No need to take Zhang Yuanzhou.

341
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:24,000
It's hard to get back to Gui Mu.

342
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:30,000
I just don't want you to get bigger and bigger.

343
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:34,000
The bigger the problem, the worse the plan.

344
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:36,000
What's the worst plan?

345
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:39,000
The Black Flames of the Great Wilderness

346
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:42,000
Is more serious than the Great Wilderness.

347
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:45,000
The Black Flames of the Great Wilderness

348
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:48,000
Are the magical objects of the Black Flames of the Great Wilderness.

349
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,000
Except the Great Wilderness,

350
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:52,000
It's still very important.

351
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:56,000
Gui Mu is a hero.

352
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:59,000
It's a great hero.

353
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,000
It's a great hero.

354
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:04,000
It's a great hero.

355
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:06,000
It's still very important.

356
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:09,000
The Great Wilderness

357
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:11,000
The Great Wilderness?

358
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:13,000
To be precise,

359
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:17,000
It's the Great Wilderness that uses the seal to seal the seal.

360
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:23,000
What kind of blood?

361
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,000
It's a blood of a demon.

362
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:31,000
Demon blood?

363
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:35,000
In the war between the Great Wilderness and the Great Wilderness,

364
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:38,000
The Dragon and the Ice Seal were also included.

365
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:40,000
And the seal was used to fight.

366
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:42,000
But in the legend,

367
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:45,000
The Ice Seal killed the seal.

368
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:47,000
It was not a match for the Dragon,

369
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:49,000
It was a blow to the eye.

370
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:51,000
That's why it was created by the Clouds.

371
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:54,000
Since they used to fight together,

372
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:57,000
Why did the Ice Seal kill the seal?

373
00:28:57,000 --> 00:29:00,000
After the legend was installed in the Palace,

374
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:03,000
The world was already in chaos.

375
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:06,000
But the seal continued to be the seal,

376
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:08,000
and the world was destroyed.

377
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:10,000
Even the wind broke the female seal to make up for it.

378
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:13,000
When the ice seal was ready,

379
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:17,000
The rebel was killed by the seal.

380
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:20,000
That's what you mean?

381
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:25,000
The ice seal was also a demon?

382
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:29,000
That's right.

383
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:31,000
The ice seal was always

384
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:34,000
a demon that was responsible for killing the evil.

385
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:36,000
So people always considered it a god.

386
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:38,000
But in fact,

387
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:42,000
It was also born to the Great Wilderness and the Great Wilderness.

388
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:46,000
Stop!

389
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:53,000
Do you want to catch me?

390
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:55,000
The evil is not a bad thing.

391
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:56,000
Of course I want to catch you.

392
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:58,000
But you are also a demon.

393
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:01,000
Are you sure you want to catch me?

394
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:07,000
Who taught you to be so...

395
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:14,000
Aunt?

396
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:17,000
Let him run away.

397
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:22,000
So,

398
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:25,000
Xiao Zhu,

399
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:27,000
You are also a demon?

400
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:30,000
Xiao Zhu,

401
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:32,000
You are a human.

402
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:36,000
I am confused.

403
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:40,000
After the battle in Mount Buzhou,

404
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:43,000
The seal was released.

405
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:47,000
You were able to remember the merit of killing the seal.

406
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:50,000
So you won the last piece of the five-color stone.

407
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:53,000
You gave it to him.

408
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:55,000
You also gave it to the seal.

409
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:57,000
You gave it to him.

410
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:59,000
You gave it to the seal.

411
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:01,000
You gave it to the seal.

412
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:03,000
You gave it to the seal.

413
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:05,000
You gave it to the seal.

414
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:09,000
So the seal's back

415
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:12,000
was not a demon.

416
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:14,000
It was a human.

417
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:17,000
The seal in the five-color stone

418
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:19,000
is the blood of the seal.

419
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:21,000
Although you respect the seal,

420
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:23,000
you are a human.

421
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:25,000
But you don't want to

422
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:27,000
use the strong power of the seal

423
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:29,000
to kill the seal.

424
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:31,000
So you use the five-color stone

425
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:33,000
to protect the seal's seal.

426
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:35,000
To save the seal.

427
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:38,000
The seal

428
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:40,000
is the seal of the seal.

429
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:42,000
The seal is the seal of the seal.

430
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:44,000
The seal is the last thing

431
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:46,000
in the world

432
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:48,000
to protect the seal.

433
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:51,000
For the seal's descendant,

434
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:54,000
it's a kind of regret medicine.

435
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:58,000
It can make the seal

436
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:00,000
choose a new identity.

437
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:05,000
So

438
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:10,000
Xiao Chuo will become a demon, too?

439
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:14,000
The seal is like a stone.

440
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:16,000
It's hard to separate.

441
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:18,000
Once the demon is born,

442
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:22,000
it will not be able to turn back.

443
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:25,000
No.

444
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:27,000
No, no, no.

445
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:29,000
You may think too much.

446
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:31,000
Xiao Chuo is a mortal.

447
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:33,000
He doesn't have the power.

448
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:35,000
Even if he has the power,

449
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:37,000
he won't be able to do anything.

450
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:39,000
You are right.

451
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:41,000
That's right.

452
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:43,000
That's exactly what I said.

453
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:45,000
The worst thing?

454
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:47,000
There is no internal reaction.

455
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:51,000
It can't be cured.

456
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:54,000
The strong medicine after the illness

457
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:57,000
will eventually be gone in Xiao Chuo's body.

458
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:00,000
Until the gold vein is broken,

459
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:02,000
the dirty seal

460
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:04,000
will be torn to pieces.

461
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:07,000
When the demon is completely dead,

462
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:12,000
it will be his dead body.

463
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:20,000
Is there no other way?

464
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:23,000
As far as I know,

465
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:26,000
it's gone.

466
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:29,000
Unless...

467
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:31,000
Unless what?

468
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:34,000
Unless the gold vein of the Ice Tribe.

469
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:37,000
There,

470
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:40,000
maybe we can find Xiao Chuo's way.

471
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:48,000
Wei Ji,

472
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:50,000
are we really going to the Ice Tribe's body?

473
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:52,000
I heard from the gods of the old mountains

474
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:54,000
that the place is very scary.

475
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:56,000
Stand there!

476
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:03,000
It's you.

477
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:05,000
Let me take care

478
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:07,000
of your wound.

479
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:11,000
I'll give you the yellow tree.

480
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:16,000
You gave the pig's head to the big tiger.

481
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:18,000
You are so arrogant.

482
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:22,000
Who doesn't know that you are a woman?

483
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:24,000
I really care about it.

484
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:28,000
I'm afraid that Xiao Chuo's master is dead.

485
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:30,000
You are being beaten by the demon after Zhao Yuan Zhou is gone.

486
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:32,000
You are fine.

487
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:34,000
How could Xiao Chuo's master be in trouble?

488
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:36,000
Master Zhuo is rich.

489
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:38,000
He is very noble.

490
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:41,000
You should take good care of him.

491
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:45,000
Did you hear that?

492
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:47,000
He said...

493
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:49,000
take good care of Xiao Chuo.

494
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:55,000
Could it be...

495
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:57,000
that he is a man of the heart?

496
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:01,000
Xiao Chuo,

497
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:03,000
hold him.

498
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:07,000
Come.

499
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:23,000
Did he come here?

500
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:40,000
What is the place of the medical record?

501
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:44,000
It's the blood of the medical group.

502
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:50,000
There are all the secret and the treasure of the medical group.

503
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:55,000
Maybe there are some other magical weapons.

504
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:57,000
Do you know where the medical record is?

505
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:00,000
Of course.

506
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:03,000
In Da Huo,

507
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:07,000
this place is very famous.

508
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:10,000
Then let's go.

509
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:02,000
The blood of the medical group is very famous.

510
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:04,000
The blood of the medical group is very famous.

511
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:06,000
The blood of the medical group is very famous.

512
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:08,000
The blood of the medical group is very famous.

513
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:10,000
The blood of the medical group is very famous.

514
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:12,000
The blood of the medical group is very famous.

515
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:14,000
The blood of the medical group is very famous.

516
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:16,000
The blood of the medical group is very famous.

517
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:18,000
The blood of the medical group is very famous.

518
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:20,000
The blood of the medical group is very famous.

519
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:22,000
The blood of the medical group is very famous.

520
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:24,000
The blood of the medical group is very famous.

521
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:26,000
The blood of the medical group is very famous.

522
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:28,000
The blood of the medical group is very famous.

523
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:30,800
The blood of the medical group is very famous.

524
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:32,000
The blood of the medical group is very famous.

525
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:34,000
The blood of the medical group is very famous.

526
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:36,000
The blood of the medical group is very famous.

527
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:38,000
The blood of the medical group is very famous.

528
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:40,000
The blood of the medical group is very popular.

529
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:42,000
The blood of the medical group is very famous.

530
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:50,000
There's an old saying

531
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:52,780
Holding on but hit suffering

532
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:55,000
饭 in the bone.

533
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:57,000
I didn't expect you, the little aunt,

534
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:00,000
You care so much about Xiao Zhuo.

535
00:38:05,800 --> 00:38:09,800
Don't think that I'm always the one who takes care of auntie.

536
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:12,300
But actually,

537
00:38:13,100 --> 00:38:15,100
since I was little,

538
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:18,400
she's always been taking care of me.

539
00:38:19,800 --> 00:38:21,300
One year,

540
00:38:21,800 --> 00:38:23,800
I got a cold.

541
00:38:25,100 --> 00:38:27,100
My dad was just outside the palace.

542
00:38:28,100 --> 00:38:32,100
Xiao Zhuo was the only one who took care of me.

543
00:38:33,300 --> 00:38:34,300
Ouyang,

544
00:38:35,300 --> 00:38:36,300
Shouye.

545
00:38:38,200 --> 00:38:39,700
Then I recovered.

546
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:43,000
She got sick by herself.

547
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:44,700
I was very guilty.

548
00:38:46,300 --> 00:38:48,300
But she told me that

549
00:38:49,400 --> 00:38:50,900
she was very happy.

550
00:38:52,100 --> 00:38:54,300
Because I gave her the seal.

551
00:38:54,900 --> 00:38:56,400
I was so happy.

552
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:03,000
Do you think that she's a good person?

553
00:39:04,500 --> 00:39:06,500
She's 15 years old.

554
00:39:08,500 --> 00:39:10,500
She's still so childish.

555
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:13,000
She's very childish.

556
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:17,000
She's also a good person.

557
00:39:17,500 --> 00:39:19,000
She's strong.

558
00:39:20,500 --> 00:39:23,000
When her brother-in-law passed away,

559
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:26,000
she was always childish.

560
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:28,500
But soon,

561
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:31,000
she got more mature.

562
00:39:31,500 --> 00:39:33,500
She became stronger and more bold.

563
00:39:33,500 --> 00:39:39,500
She became a genius who was so proud of herself.

564
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:41,500
Sometimes,

565
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:45,000
she's so selfish.

566
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:49,500
Maybe it's not because she's a sensible person.

567
00:39:51,500 --> 00:39:53,000
But,

568
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:58,500
what is it?

569
00:40:02,500 --> 00:40:04,500
It's because of loneliness.

570
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:14,500
Are you afraid?

571
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:19,500
Don't be afraid.

572
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:22,500
Now, Xiao Zhuo

573
00:40:23,500 --> 00:40:25,000
and the old her

574
00:40:25,500 --> 00:40:27,000
are different.

575
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:30,500
She has us.

576
00:40:36,500 --> 00:40:38,000
She's not lonely.

577
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:39,500
The Jiao Si team

578
00:40:39,500 --> 00:40:41,000
is not only you.

579
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:42,500
You don't have to fight for yourself.

580
00:40:42,500 --> 00:40:44,000
Let me go.

581
00:40:45,500 --> 00:40:48,000
I'll go to the Great Helmet's man to find the daughter.

582
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:54,500
If the sky is the place where the jade jade is,

583
00:40:54,500 --> 00:40:56,500
I'll definitely take you back to the tomb.

584
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:22,000
The Great Helmet

585
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:44,500
It's getting cold.

586
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:47,500
Why are you blowing the wind here?

587
00:41:48,500 --> 00:41:50,500
I'm not afraid.

588
00:41:53,500 --> 00:41:54,500
Sister,

589
00:41:56,500 --> 00:41:58,500
are you worried about Lord Zhuo

590
00:42:00,500 --> 00:42:02,500
and the Baijiu brothers?

591
00:42:04,500 --> 00:42:06,500
I'm the youngest in the nine years.

592
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:09,500
I'm not a bowler.

593
00:42:10,500 --> 00:42:11,500
I'm not afraid.

594
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:14,500
I'm always hiding

595
00:42:15,500 --> 00:42:18,000
behind Xiao Zhuo.

596
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:22,000
I don't know if he's afraid

597
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:26,000
of the situation.

598
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:32,000
Sister is so good at the Baijiu.

599
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:37,000
Just like my brother.

600
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:42,000
I was also a iron-weather.

601
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:45,000
I'm used to taking care of him.

602
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:51,000
Now I'm a bowler.

603
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:54,000
I'll be hurt.

604
00:42:55,500 --> 00:42:57,000
I'll be hurt.

605
00:42:59,500 --> 00:43:01,500
I'm also able to protect you.

606
00:43:03,500 --> 00:43:05,500
But the Baijiu brothers are different.

607
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:08,500
He needs you very much.

608
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:11,000
So sister

609
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:14,000
will be so concerned

610
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:17,000
about him.

611
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:25,000
Yes.

612
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:35,000
But Ah Heng is Ah Heng.

613
00:43:35,500 --> 00:43:37,500
He's never someone else.

614
00:43:38,500 --> 00:43:40,500
He will never be someone else.

615
00:43:44,500 --> 00:43:46,500
No one can replace you.

616
00:43:50,500 --> 00:43:53,500
It's also because you and I fight together

617
00:43:55,500 --> 00:43:57,500
that I can protect others better.

618
00:44:05,500 --> 00:44:06,500
I'm very happy.

619
00:44:08,500 --> 00:44:10,500
I finally don't know sister's revenge.

620
00:44:11,500 --> 00:44:13,500
I can also be her開-fire.

621
00:44:14,500 --> 00:44:15,500
But

622
00:44:20,500 --> 00:44:21,500
But what?

623
00:44:28,500 --> 00:44:29,500
Nothing.

624
00:44:32,500 --> 00:44:33,500
I'm just happy.

625
00:44:35,500 --> 00:44:36,500
I'm happy.

626
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:38,000
Sister.

627
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:04,000
Father.

628
00:45:04,500 --> 00:45:05,500
Don't cry.

629
00:45:05,500 --> 00:45:06,500
Xiao Zhu.

630
00:45:08,500 --> 00:45:09,500
Don't cry.

631
00:45:09,500 --> 00:45:10,500
Xiao Zhu.

632
00:45:27,500 --> 00:45:28,500
Xiao Zhu.

633
00:45:29,500 --> 00:45:30,500
Where are you going?

634
00:45:31,500 --> 00:45:32,500
Baijiu.

635
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:35,500
I'm going to the hospital.

636
00:45:35,500 --> 00:45:36,500
I'm going to the hospital.

637
00:45:36,500 --> 00:45:37,500
