2
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:05,000
I'm sorry, but I'm not sure if I can get the money back.

3
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:10,000
I'm sorry, but I'm not sure if I can get the money back.

4
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:15,000
I'm sorry, but I'm not sure if I can get the money back.

5
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:20,000
I'm sorry, but I'm not sure if I can get the money back.

6
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:25,000
I'm sorry, but I'm not sure if I can get the money back.

7
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:31,000
I'm sorry, but I'm not sure if I can get the money back.

8
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:36,000
I'm sorry, but I'm not sure if I can get the money back.

9
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:41,000
The End

10
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Wei Long is not just a kind of spicy

11
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Welcome to watch the big dream return

12
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Xiao Jiu

13
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Xiao Jiu

14
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Sister Pei

15
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Sister Pei

16
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Sister Pei

17
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Don't kill him

18
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,000
What do you care about him?

19
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,000
I just think

20
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,000
I don't want to kill him

21
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Li Xin

22
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Our body is a Zhao Yanzhou

23
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Let me try

24
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000
You lost so little

25
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
What's so good about it?

26
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Bai Jiu

27
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
We have to look at your wrist

28
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,000
I'll kill you

29
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,000
I'll kill you

30
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,000
I'll kill you

31
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,000
I'll kill you

32
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,000
I'll kill you

33
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,000
I'll kill you

34
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
I'll kill you

35
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
I'll kill you

36
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
I'll kill you

37
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
I'll kill you

38
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
I'll kill you

39
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,000
I'll kill you

40
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,000
I'll kill you

41
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,000
I'll kill you

42
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,000
I'll kill you

43
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
I'm really a person of honor

44
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Don't you think it's interesting?

45
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
I'm really curious

46
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:55,000
When did he start to force me to do nothing?

47
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,000
You guys take this first

48
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
This is my own research

49
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,000
I'm sorry for the smell

50
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Wei Jiu

51
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Wei Jiu

52
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Wei Jiu

53
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
What are you looking for?

54
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
I'm going to make a new version of the game

55
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Are you ready?

56
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,000
You're so stubborn

57
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
You're so useless

58
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
You're even a little ridiculous

59
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
You're so mean

60
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
You're so stubborn

61
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Why are you afraid of my eyes?

62
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Your own eyes

63
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
I can't see the way

64
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Mr. Hou, what's going on?

65
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Take this

66
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,000
I'm going to make a sound

67
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,000
I'm sure it's a problem

68
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
I don't know if it's going to work

69
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
I heard it

70
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
I didn't expect the little white rabbit

71
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
to look so serious

72
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
when he was out of the world

73
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
If something big happens

74
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
not only have deep dreams

75
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
but also have patience

76
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
and no fun

77
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,000
From the moment

78
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
you entered the capital

79
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:19,000
you've been in this

80
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
The group of the evil

81
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
and the group of the immortal

82
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,000
and the list of these people

83
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
What do you think is the reason?

84
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Didn't Mr. Xiao Zhuo choose it?

85
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
It's you

86
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
If you want your inner burden

87
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
you have to go through your own hardships

88
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
This little white wine

89
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,000
can make it for me

90
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
But it's not enough experience

91
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
You need someone

92
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
to protect it

93
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Mr. Wei

94
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Don't you think

95
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
I'm a good warrior

96
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
You just want to push it back

97
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,000
You just want to push it back

98
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,000
You deliberately arranged me

99
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000
to leave the Chongwu Camp

100
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
and then got watched by Ji Yaosi

101
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Mr. Wei is not only a great warrior

102
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
but also a great warrior

103
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Moreover, he has a grudge with Chongwu Camp

104
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Ji Yaosi is not the one

105
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
who chooses such a great person

106
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Who else will he choose?

107
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:27,000
Moreover, you just joined the family

108
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
I'm afraid I'll be too emotional

109
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
to face the white wine

110
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,000
I'm in love with you

111
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
I'll be so sad

112
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,000
I'll keep your name

113
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,000
with you every day

114
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
I'll take it

115
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
You're so despicable

116
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000
If the white wine doesn't work

117
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,000
I'll leave the rest to you

118
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
I'll leave the rest to you

119
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Even Mr. Zhuo

120
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
is your wife and son

121
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
If I'm Ji Yaosi's colleague

122
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:08,000
I'll join the team of the former

123
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
Moreover, he's the only one

124
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
who can kill you

125
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,000
Mr. Bai

126
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,000
I want to destroy him

127
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
with the divorce cooperation

128
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
I'll give you

129
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,000
the bomb in the far away

130
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
Do you promise me?

131
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Why hide the white wine

132
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
on you and Wen Xiao?

133
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
Of course, you must be tied together

134
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,000
You must experience the difficulties

135
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,000
and let your heart move

136
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,000
Now, the distance is closed

137
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
The last step is to avoid your misunderstanding

138
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,000
I only need to use the needle

139
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:51,000
to seal your feelings

140
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
and then I'll be able to do it

141
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,000
You're a mortal

142
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
Why do you want my internal pills?

143
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000
I want all the pills

144
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
that you want from the beginning

145
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,000
The recent disaster

146
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,000
finally found the man

147
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,000
who wanted the non-invulnerable number

148
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,000
It means

149
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
this is the last non-invulnerable number

150
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
in the world

151
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,000
Do you want me to keep an eye on it?

152
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
Eight years ago

153
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
you made me feel so sad

154
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
In the last non-invulnerable number

155
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
that I found in this world

156
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
I've been looking for you for eight years

157
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
I've been looking for you for eight years

158
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,000
I've been looking for you for eight years

159
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,000
Baiqiu

160
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
Aren't we your friends?

161
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,000
Don't come any closer

162
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
You've lost so much

163
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:52,000
How could I let Xiao Bai poison Zhen?

164
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,000
What's wrong, Zhao Yanzhou?

165
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:22,000
I can't tell you the number of your magic

166
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,000
Xiao Jiu

167
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,000
Think it over

168
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,000
I'll kill you

169
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,000
I'll kill you

170
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,000
I'll kill you

171
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,000
I'll kill you

172
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,000
I'll kill you

173
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,000
I'll kill you

174
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,000
I'll kill you

175
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,000
I'll kill you

176
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
Stop

177
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,000
I'll kill you

178
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,000
I'm so glad you're alive

179
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
You still hope she'll live

180
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,000
or die

181
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,000
Don't worry

182
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000
Whether it's minister Fan's order

183
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
or minister Cheng's order

184
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,000
I won't be able to suppress it

185
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,000
I'll kill Zhao Yanzhou

186
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:45,000
I'm the only one who can kill Zhao Yanzhou

187
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
I won't be a ghost

188
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:55,000
If we repair Bai Zelin

189
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:59,000
we can finally suppress Zhao Yanzhou's power

190
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,000
Will you kill him?

191
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,000
The demon water is polluting

192
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,000
The demon water is polluting

193
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,000
The god is gone

194
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,000
If you say so

195
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,000
I hope it's too blinding

196
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
I won't take this opportunity

197
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,000
But if

198
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,000
I hope it's not blinding

199
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,000
What do you mean?

200
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,000
Zhao Yanzhou and I mentioned

201
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,000
the clue of the god

202
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,000
in the private library

203
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,000
Private library?

204
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,000
Lord Zhuo

205
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,000
Lord Situ Yun

206
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,000
Lord Zhuo

207
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,000
Take Miss Wenxia away from here

208
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,000
Why is Lord Zhuo so panic?

209
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,000
What happened?

210
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,000
Zhenmei, what are you doing?

211
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
The demon water is polluting

212
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
The minister killed

213
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,000
The minister killed

214
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,000
The minister killed

215
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,000
The demon water is polluting

216
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,000
The god is gone

217
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,000
The minister killed

218
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,000
The demon water is polluting

219
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,000
The god is gone

220
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,000
The god is gone

221
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,000
It's Miss Wenxiao

222
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,000
How could it be?

223
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
It's clear that you are from the Qingyan

224
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,000
Are you in the middle of the Wenxiao?

225
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,000
After you killed the carriage

226
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,000
You killed the minister

227
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,000
You have a low blood pressure

228
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,000
All the families

229
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,000
are from the Qingyan

230
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,000
The carriage

231
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,000
is dead

232
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,000
Wenxiao is in danger

233
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,000
He is out of control

234
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,000
You are talking nonsense

235
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
Wenxiao is in the Jiao Temple all night

236
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,000
He can do anything

237
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,000
I stay here all night

238
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,000
My father punished me

239
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,000
Chong Wuyang

240
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,000
He is in the blood

241
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,000
It's a big deal

242
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,000
If we don't have the guarantee

243
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,000
We won't be in the blood

244
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,000
There must be

245
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,000
something strange in the blood

246
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,000
The situation is unknown

247
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,000
There are a lot of witnesses on both sides

248
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,000
We can't prove ourselves

249
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,000
Lord Zhuo

250
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
You should take Miss Wenxiao first

251
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,000
Before Chong Wuyang closes the gate

252
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,000
I will take Wenxiao to the city

253
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,000
No

254
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,000
I don't want to go to the city

255
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,000
They have decided that I will run away

256
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,000
So this is the safest place

257
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,000
in the capital city

258
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
That's the case

259
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,000
But the capital city is not big

260
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,000
Chong Wuyang is in the capital city

261
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,000
It's a long time

262
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,000
We can search the capital city

263
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,000
We can wait for them to come back

264
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,000
So

265
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,000
Please take it

266
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:18,000
The world is not as good as you

267
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,000
I want to see

268
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,000
who dares to stop me

269
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,000
I dare to

270
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,000
I dare to

271
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,000
I am so anxious

272
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,000
I will kill Chen Xiang

273
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,000
and Zhen Xiong Wenxiao

274
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,000
If I dare to do anything

275
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,000
I will die

276
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,000
Go to arrest people

277
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,000
I will kill them

278
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,000
I will kill them

279
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,000
I will kill them

280
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,000
I will kill them

281
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,000
I will kill them

282
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,000
I will kill them

283
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,000
I will kill them

284
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,000
I will kill them

285
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,000
I will kill them

286
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,000
Master

287
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,000
The Jiao Si has been searched

288
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,000
There are no people in the city

289
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,000
The city gate is closed

290
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,000
Search the city

291
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,000
Search all the houses

292
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,000
Search all the houses

293
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,000
The police will send the order

294
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,000
to arrest Zhong Fan

295
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,000
Wenxiao

296
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,000
The police will send the order

297
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,000
to arrest Zhong Fan

298
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,000
Wenxiao

299
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,000
Wenxiao

300
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,000
Wenxiao

301
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,000
Wenxiao

302
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,000
Wenxiao

303
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,000
Wenxiao

304
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,000
Wenxiao

305
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,000
Wenxiao

306
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,000
Wenxiao

307
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,000
Come out

308
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,000
Wenxiao

309
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,000
Wenxiao

310
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,000
Go

311
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,000
Master Si Tu

312
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,000
Why are you so afraid?

313
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,000
Go inside

314
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,000
Don't let others see you

315
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,000
What's wrong with that room?

316
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,000
Why is it so windy?

317
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,000
That's the bedroom in the capital

318
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,000
He is sleeping in the window all year

319
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,000
He is afraid of the wind and light

320
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,000
He is afraid of the wind and light

321
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,000
Many years

322
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,000
Wenxiao

323
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,000
Come with me

324
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,000
Come with me

325
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,000
Xiao Jiu hasn't come home for a long time

326
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,000
You should stay in his room

327
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,000
So coincidental

328
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,000
You are here

329
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,000
You are here

330
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,000
I didn't expect

331
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,000
It's Bai Jing

332
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,000
Yes

333
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,000
I didn't expect it was him

334
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,000
I didn't expect it was him

335
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,000
I didn't expect it was him

336
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,000
I didn't expect

337
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,000
You were chased by the whole city

338
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,000
You are so powerful

339
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,000
What did you expect?

340
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:55,000
Master Si Tu would like to keep me

341
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:58,000
I can investigate the clues of the tomb

342
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,000
But you are so strange

343
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,000
Why did you appear here?

344
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,000
Of course I came to find the tomb

345
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,000
Commander Zhu

346
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,000
This is the carriage made by the Prime Minister

347
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,000
I just brought it here

348
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,000
What is it?

349
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,000
According to the driver's instructions

350
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,000
The murderer is killed

351
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,000
He will be killed in no time

352
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,000
and be killed

353
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,000
Li Ji

354
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,000
The books of this kind of classic

355
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,000
The Prime Minister should have known it

356
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,000
Why is he still reading them?

357
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:49,000
This Li Ji

358
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,000
Only Zhang Fan Huang

359
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,000
Should be a little old

360
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,000
The border is broken

361
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,000
It must be a long-standing conflict

362
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,000
But the set line

363
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,000
Is new

364
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,000
It means it's true

365
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,000
Only the books of this kind can be understood

366
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,000
Only then can we distinguish

367
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:19,000
The real good and evil in this world

368
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:23,000
If one day

369
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,000
I can prove it

370
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:27,000
I must make a living for the world

371
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:33,000
Maybe

372
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:36,000
What is the Prime Minister's intention to re-read?

373
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,000
It's raining all night

374
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:43,000
The rumor of the female demon is not true

375
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:47,000
It's said that the Prime Minister was eaten by the female demon

376
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:49,000
Only a white bone left

377
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:50,000
Lord Fan

378
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,000
You have been a great writer since you were young

379
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,000
You are a writer

380
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:57,000
You don't know

381
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,000
Of course I know I'm not a writer

382
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:01,000
The female demon must have someone

383
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:03,000
I'm just a writer

384
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:05,000
Everyone in the factory

385
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,000
Is the carriage of Wen Xiaolan

386
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,000
Where is the Prime Minister's master?

387
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:28,000
Liu Huo

388
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:35,000
The people in the Chongwu Camp have been in chaos

389
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:37,000
The Prime Minister's body has been taken away

390
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,000
But these dead bodies are also

391
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:44,000
This is another murder that happened outside the capital

392
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:47,000
A man was killed in the forest

393
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,000
And the whole way was killed

394
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:55,000
The family thought it was a monster

395
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:57,000
So they sent us to the Demon City

396
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:00,000
The dead bodies

397
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,000
Are similar to the Prime Minister's body

398
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,000
I'm thinking

399
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:09,000
The dead bodies have the smell of Liu Huang

400
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:15,000
There was also Liu Huang's scent in the carriage

401
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:17,000
Liu Huang

402
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:21,000
What monster has the smell of Liu Huang?

403
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:23,000
It should be the owl

404
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:29,000
Because

405
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:31,000
Why are you here?

406
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:32,000
Lord Xiaozhou

407
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,000
What happened to Kunlun Mountain?

408
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:35,000
Nothing

409
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:37,000
Now there are no people in the mountain

410
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:40,000
The other few mountains are guarding the city

411
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,000
I came here because I succeeded in the development of the water

412
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:43,000
Lord Xiaozhou

413
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:48,000
Great

414
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:52,000
I want to send this back to Lord Shengyun

415
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,000
But I just got into the capital

416
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:56,000
It's a big accident

417
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:57,000
Even the Prime Minister would dare to attack

418
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:59,000
It's a woman

419
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:01,000
There are really monsters in the Demon City

420
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:03,000
Now the people are in panic

421
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:04,000
The government has sent the propaganda order

422
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,000
Hurry up and catch her

423
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,000
The evil woman

424
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,000
She appeared in the Demon City

425
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:13,000
It seems that I have to go to Lord Shengyun

426
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:21,000
Lord Shen

427
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:23,000
Lord Shen

428
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:26,000
I found out that Lord Shengyun was being attacked

429
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:29,000
It was caused by the owl

430
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:32,000
What is the owl?

431
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:35,000
The owl is a monster guarding the city

432
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:37,000
in the western part of Mount Huoshan

433
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:40,000
The most favorite food is human brain and human heart

434
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:42,000
The action world is hidden in the hidden cave

435
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,000
The most dangerous is the poison

436
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:48,000
The enemy of Mount Huoshan is just about to be killed

437
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:51,000
What can we find him?

438
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:52,000
Of course

439
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:53,000
Lord Bingo

440
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:54,000
We found out that

441
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:55,000
He was really not ready to attack

442
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:57,000
The soldiers of Tong Wuyin

443
00:25:57,000 --> 00:26:00,000
I'll go find Wenxiao first

444
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,000
I'll leave the thing to you

445
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,000
Don't worry

446
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:07,000
I ran away

447
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:09,000
You ran away too

448
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:11,000
Isn't the Chongwu Camp a mess now?

449
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:12,000
Before the Chongwu Camp

450
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:14,000
I was busy with the drug research

451
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:16,000
I gave them a little building

452
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:18,000
I can turn the attention

453
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:22,000
You were affected by the poison

454
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:25,000
What if the needle is the last one?

455
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:27,000
Then you are not...

456
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:29,000
I am a demon

457
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:31,000
It's so easy to get the internal pill

458
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:33,000
You are still worried about yourself

459
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:36,000
How to get rid of the crime of killing the Prime Minister

460
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:40,000
I didn't expect that the poison

461
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:43,000
was so scary on the surface

462
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:45,000
The hidden cave

463
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:48,000
The hidden cave

464
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,000
The Great Man

465
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:00,000
They should be here soon

466
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:05,000
Xiaojiu

467
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:06,000
Xiaojiu

468
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:08,000
Why are you back?

469
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:10,000
I came to see my mother

470
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:13,000
My good friend is back

471
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:18,000
You said that I can see my mother

472
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:20,000
when I come back

473
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:21,000
Xiaojiu

474
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:23,000
Have you eaten?

475
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:25,000
Do you want to eat something?

476
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:27,000
I'll make you something you like

477
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:29,000
Please forgive me

478
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:31,000
There are three people here

479
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:33,000
Zhao Yanzhou

480
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:34,000
Mr. Pei

481
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:36,000
Why are you here?

482
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:38,000
You escaped from the Chongwu Camp

483
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:47,000
You escaped?

484
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:49,000
I escaped

485
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:51,000
You escaped?

486
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:53,000
What?

487
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:55,000
You escaped?

488
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:57,000
I'll go to Chongwu Camp

489
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:59,000
Are you worried?

490
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:01,000
Zhao Yanzhou

491
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:03,000
What nonsense are you talking about?

492
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:07,000
I think you all misunderstand

493
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:09,000
I wrote that letter on purpose

494
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:11,000
I'm afraid our Xiaojiu is dangerous

495
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:12,000
So I...

496
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:14,000
I don't misunderstand

497
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:16,000
Baijiu

498
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:18,000
It's really the spy of Chongwu Camp

499
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:20,000
Spy?

500
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:31,000
Why did you help Chongwu Camp?

501
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:39,000
Do you remember what I said

502
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:41,000
when I helped you to get out of the camp?

503
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:47,000
Xiaojiu

504
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:49,000
I'll ask you seriously

505
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:51,000
Do you

506
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:54,000
have anything to hide from us?

507
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:01,000
I remember

508
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:04,000
I'll ask you again

509
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:08,000
Are you hiding something from us?

510
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:16,000
If you are hiding something from us

511
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:18,000
I'll ask you again

512
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:20,000
I'll ask you again

513
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,000
Then

514
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:24,000
Are you willing to be a traitor?

515
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:30,000
Or a friend of my Chuo Yichen?

516
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:37,000
You choose

517
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:41,000
Mr. Xiao Zhuo

518
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:43,000
You all

519
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:45,000
still believe in me?

520
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:48,000
As long as you say

521
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:50,000
I trust you

522
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,000
All of what I did

523
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:07,000
was for my mother

524
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,000
Xiaojiu

525
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:13,000
I'm here to see you

526
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:17,000
Ten

527
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:19,000
Nine

528
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:20,000
Eight

529
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:21,000
Seven

530
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:22,000
Six

531
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:23,000
Five

532
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:24,000
Four

533
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:25,000
Three

534
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:26,000
Two

535
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:27,000
One

536
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:28,000
Ten

537
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:29,000
Ten

538
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:30,000
Ten

539
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:31,000
Ten

540
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:32,000
Ten

541
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:33,000
Ten

542
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:34,000
Ten

543
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:35,000
Ten

544
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:36,000
Ten

545
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:37,000
Ten

546
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:39,000
Ten

547
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:41,000
I'll ask you again

548
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:46,000
Where did Xiaojiu hide?

549
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:49,000
Can't find the mother

550
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:51,000
Xiaojiu

551
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:55,000
Baijiu

552
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:03,000
Xiaojiu

553
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:05,000
Whatever Xiaojiu is hiding

554
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:07,000
How long will it take for us to grow a flower?

555
00:31:07,880 --> 00:31:09,880
We will find you both.

556
00:31:15,880 --> 00:31:17,880
Why did you kill my wife?

557
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:22,040
Xiaoqiu, the cabinet is broken.

558
00:31:22,440 --> 00:31:24,920
And you can hide somewhere else, right?

559
00:31:24,920 --> 00:31:28,120
Guiyin, please help me. I can't find my wife today.

560
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:37,080
Don't be so serious. Let's go together.

561
00:32:05,880 --> 00:32:08,600
Remember to give your life to them.

562
00:32:10,100 --> 00:32:11,660
Hello, I'm an OG緊국

563
00:32:13,120 --> 00:32:13,600
Xiao.

564
00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:15,360
Xiao, Iани.

565
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:17,440
You can marry her.

566
00:32:17,840 --> 00:32:19,780
I've been given the public's safety.

567
00:32:20,080 --> 00:32:22,400
This is my way to protect you.

568
00:32:23,360 --> 00:32:25,320
Hurry, let's go out together.

569
00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:26,800
Hurry.

570
00:32:29,920 --> 00:32:33,160
Let me and Xiao go.

571
00:32:33,160 --> 00:32:35,160
Mother! Mother!

572
00:32:35,160 --> 00:32:36,160
Xiao Qiao!

573
00:32:36,160 --> 00:32:38,160
Xiao Qiao! Come here! Come here!

574
00:32:38,160 --> 00:32:40,160
I'm going to save you!

575
00:32:41,160 --> 00:32:43,160
Your mother is fine! Your mother is fine!

576
00:32:55,160 --> 00:32:58,160
Xiao Qiao, you're dreaming.

577
00:32:58,160 --> 00:33:02,160
I'll be fine when I wake up tomorrow morning.

578
00:33:14,160 --> 00:33:15,160
Lan Qing!

579
00:33:16,160 --> 00:33:19,160
Mother, are you okay?

580
00:33:21,160 --> 00:33:24,160
I'm fine! I'm not going to the hospital!

581
00:33:24,160 --> 00:33:26,160
I'm going to the hospital!

582
00:33:26,160 --> 00:33:29,160
I'm fine! I'm fine!

583
00:33:49,160 --> 00:33:53,160
Mother, today is my birthday.

584
00:33:53,160 --> 00:33:56,160
I've grown taller and I've become darker.

585
00:33:57,160 --> 00:33:59,160
I've learned a lot of art.

586
00:34:00,160 --> 00:34:02,160
I can cure your illness.

587
00:34:03,160 --> 00:34:06,160
Can't you come out and see me?

588
00:34:07,160 --> 00:34:10,160
Mother, I miss you so much.

589
00:34:10,160 --> 00:34:14,160
Every year, I wish to see you.

590
00:34:15,160 --> 00:34:17,160
Can you open the door?

591
00:34:23,160 --> 00:34:28,160
Mother, I've finished reading the family's medical books.

592
00:34:29,160 --> 00:34:32,160
I went out to find the best master, Bai Shi Qiu Xue.

593
00:34:32,160 --> 00:34:36,160
One day, I will cure you.

594
00:34:53,160 --> 00:34:55,160
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

595
00:34:55,160 --> 00:34:57,160
I'm sorry.

596
00:34:57,160 --> 00:34:59,160
I'm sorry.

597
00:34:59,160 --> 00:35:01,160
I'm sorry.

598
00:35:01,160 --> 00:35:03,160
I'm sorry.

599
00:35:03,160 --> 00:35:05,160
I'm sorry.

600
00:35:05,160 --> 00:35:07,160
I'm sorry.

601
00:35:07,160 --> 00:35:09,160
I'm sorry.

602
00:35:09,160 --> 00:35:11,160
I'm sorry.

603
00:35:11,160 --> 00:35:13,160
I'm sorry.

604
00:35:13,160 --> 00:35:15,160
I'm sorry.

605
00:35:15,160 --> 00:35:17,160
I'm sorry.

606
00:35:17,160 --> 00:35:19,160
I'm sorry.

607
00:35:19,160 --> 00:35:21,160
I'm sorry.

608
00:35:21,160 --> 00:35:27,160
III shutdown

609
00:35:46,160 --> 00:35:47,160
I'm a new student.

610
00:35:47,160 --> 00:35:50,160
I'm called Xie...

611
00:35:51,160 --> 00:35:53,160
I'm Bai Jiao.

612
00:35:53,160 --> 00:35:57,160
Master, you really said that you could save my mother?

613
00:35:57,160 --> 00:36:01,160
I promise you that I will save your mother.

614
00:36:01,160 --> 00:36:04,160
But I also need your help.

615
00:36:04,160 --> 00:36:07,160
If you join the Jiao Si's front line,

616
00:36:07,160 --> 00:36:11,160
I only need your sense of sense of being closed to the eyes.

617
00:36:11,160 --> 00:36:14,160
I know you're kind, but you're a demon.

618
00:36:14,160 --> 00:36:17,160
Your mother is the one who was killed by the demon.

619
00:36:17,160 --> 00:36:19,160
If you don't kill her,

620
00:36:19,160 --> 00:36:24,160
the world will have more than 20 mothers like you.

621
00:36:28,160 --> 00:36:31,160
Jiao, you're so stupid.

622
00:36:31,160 --> 00:36:34,160
Your mother is not the one who was killed by the demon.

623
00:36:34,160 --> 00:36:36,160
I'm sorry.

624
00:36:36,160 --> 00:36:39,160
Jiao, you're so stupid.

625
00:36:39,160 --> 00:36:41,160
Your mother is not the one who was killed by the demon.

626
00:36:41,160 --> 00:36:44,160
She's not sick either.

627
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:48,160
You're fooled by Wen Zong Yu.

628
00:36:48,160 --> 00:36:51,160
Then what about me?

629
00:36:59,160 --> 00:37:01,160
You're a man of your own accord.

630
00:37:01,160 --> 00:37:04,160
Don't mind Jiao.

631
00:37:06,160 --> 00:37:09,160
I'm sorry.

632
00:37:09,160 --> 00:37:12,160
I'm sorry.

633
00:37:12,160 --> 00:37:15,160
I'm sorry.

634
00:37:15,160 --> 00:37:18,160
I'm sorry.

635
00:37:18,160 --> 00:37:21,160
I'm sorry.

636
00:37:21,160 --> 00:37:24,160
I'm sorry.

637
00:37:24,160 --> 00:37:27,160
I'm sorry.

638
00:37:27,160 --> 00:37:30,160
I'm sorry.

639
00:37:30,160 --> 00:37:33,160
I'm sorry.

640
00:37:33,160 --> 00:37:36,160
I'm sorry.

641
00:37:36,160 --> 00:37:39,160
I'm sorry.

642
00:37:39,160 --> 00:37:42,160
I'm sorry.

643
00:37:42,160 --> 00:37:45,160
I'm sorry.

644
00:37:45,160 --> 00:37:48,160
I'm sorry.

645
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:51,160
I'm sorry.

646
00:37:51,160 --> 00:37:54,160
I'm sorry.

647
00:37:54,160 --> 00:37:57,160
I'm sorry.

648
00:37:57,160 --> 00:38:00,160
I'm sorry.

649
00:38:00,160 --> 00:38:03,160
I'm sorry.

650
00:38:14,160 --> 00:38:17,160
Where's my mother?

651
00:38:21,160 --> 00:38:24,160
Where's my mother?

652
00:38:30,160 --> 00:38:32,160
This is your mother.

653
00:38:36,160 --> 00:38:38,160
You're nonsense.

654
00:38:39,160 --> 00:38:41,160
Your father isn't.

655
00:38:42,160 --> 00:38:44,160
Your mother...

656
00:38:45,160 --> 00:38:47,160
...wasn't human.

657
00:38:49,160 --> 00:38:54,160
Your mother and Ying Lei were half-dead half-dead blood.

658
00:38:54,160 --> 00:38:56,160
She was born in ancient times.

659
00:38:57,160 --> 00:38:59,160
She was born with the same name as Zhongshan.

660
00:39:01,160 --> 00:39:02,160
That's right.

661
00:39:02,160 --> 00:39:06,160
Your mother is the descendant of the White Emperor Shaohao and the Sword-Messing Book.

662
00:39:09,160 --> 00:39:13,160
Your mother, Zhen Shen, is the same as the one who painted the White Zhe's power.

663
00:39:14,160 --> 00:39:16,160
She's also the same as the one who painted the White Zhe's power.

664
00:39:16,160 --> 00:39:18,160
So eight years ago,

665
00:39:18,160 --> 00:39:20,160
the disappearance of the White Zhe's order

666
00:39:20,160 --> 00:39:23,160
caused her to receive Zhongshan and be destroyed.

667
00:39:23,160 --> 00:39:24,160
Mother!

668
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:26,160
She was found out by Zhen Shen.

669
00:39:26,160 --> 00:39:28,160
Mother!

670
00:39:28,160 --> 00:39:30,160
Mother!

671
00:39:50,160 --> 00:39:52,160
Even if my mother becomes a book,

672
00:39:52,160 --> 00:39:54,160
she won't be Zhen Shen.

673
00:39:54,160 --> 00:39:56,160
She won't talk to me for a long time.

674
00:39:56,160 --> 00:39:58,160
Don't...

675
00:39:58,160 --> 00:40:00,160
Don't you ever doubt me.

676
00:40:02,160 --> 00:40:04,160
The White Zhe's order was lost.

677
00:40:05,160 --> 00:40:07,160
The Goddess is not at the throne.

678
00:40:08,160 --> 00:40:10,160
She was in a panic and was lost.

679
00:40:11,160 --> 00:40:13,160
So Lord Baiyan lost his power.

680
00:40:14,160 --> 00:40:17,160
He had to sacrifice his life to the world.

681
00:40:21,160 --> 00:40:22,160
Mother.

682
00:40:23,160 --> 00:40:25,160
You let me hear it.

683
00:40:26,160 --> 00:40:28,160
I...

684
00:40:28,160 --> 00:40:30,160
I'm Xiaoqiu.

685
00:40:32,160 --> 00:40:34,160
I'm back.

686
00:40:40,160 --> 00:40:42,160
I'm back.

687
00:40:57,160 --> 00:41:00,160
Mother, can you still change the way you used to be?

688
00:41:01,160 --> 00:41:03,160
As long as the White Zhe's order is restored,

689
00:41:04,160 --> 00:41:06,160
the Great Huang Chong is like this.

690
00:41:07,160 --> 00:41:09,160
Your mother will come back.

691
00:41:12,160 --> 00:41:14,160
Why don't you tell me?

692
00:41:15,160 --> 00:41:17,160
You were too young at that time.

693
00:41:18,160 --> 00:41:20,160
I didn't know how I would tell you

694
00:41:20,160 --> 00:41:22,160
how you should accept this.

695
00:41:22,160 --> 00:41:24,160
If you don't do everything,

696
00:41:25,160 --> 00:41:27,160
ordinary people will not accept it.

697
00:41:28,160 --> 00:41:30,160
But Bai Jiu has the right to know the truth.

698
00:41:33,160 --> 00:41:34,160
Although he was young,

699
00:41:35,160 --> 00:41:37,160
he was far from the same age as the child.

700
00:41:38,160 --> 00:41:39,160
I believe

701
00:41:40,160 --> 00:41:42,160
if the Grand Priest knew it,

702
00:41:43,160 --> 00:41:45,160
he would understand it.

703
00:41:46,160 --> 00:41:48,160
If he knew the truth,

704
00:41:48,160 --> 00:41:50,160
he would not have been able to tell me the truth.

705
00:41:51,160 --> 00:41:53,160
Father, I'm sorry.

706
00:41:54,160 --> 00:41:55,160
I...

707
00:41:55,160 --> 00:41:56,160
I'm sorry.

708
00:41:58,160 --> 00:41:59,160
I'm sorry.

709
00:42:01,160 --> 00:42:02,160
I'm sorry.

710
00:42:04,160 --> 00:42:06,160
I'm sorry.

711
00:42:08,160 --> 00:42:09,160
I'm sorry.

712
00:42:11,160 --> 00:42:13,160
I hurt you.

713
00:42:14,160 --> 00:42:15,160
You...

714
00:42:15,160 --> 00:42:16,160
I hurt you.

715
00:42:17,160 --> 00:42:19,160
You all really treat me like this.

716
00:42:22,160 --> 00:42:24,160
I don't want to ruin your life.

717
00:42:25,160 --> 00:42:26,160
Jiu.

718
00:42:46,160 --> 00:42:47,160
Jiu.

719
00:42:48,160 --> 00:42:49,160
You've grown up.

720
00:42:50,160 --> 00:42:52,160
You're a good friend.

721
00:42:53,160 --> 00:42:55,160
You're not a good teacher.

722
00:42:57,160 --> 00:42:59,160
You can do it yourself.

723
00:43:03,160 --> 00:43:04,160
It's okay if you're wrong.

724
00:43:06,160 --> 00:43:09,160
As long as you can afford to grow up,

725
00:43:11,160 --> 00:43:12,160
try to make up for it.

726
00:43:16,160 --> 00:43:17,160
Gu Hanyu.

727
00:43:19,160 --> 00:43:20,160
Go back to the same age.

728
00:43:21,160 --> 00:43:23,160
It's still a chaotic evening.

729
00:43:32,160 --> 00:43:33,160
In fact,

730
00:43:34,160 --> 00:43:35,160
the real crime of taking the goods

731
00:43:36,160 --> 00:43:38,160
is not a little white rabbit

732
00:43:39,160 --> 00:43:40,160
that's easily fooled by you.

733
00:43:41,160 --> 00:43:43,160
But it's a wolf that's really dangerous.

734
00:43:43,160 --> 00:43:45,160
It's a wolf that's really dangerous.

735
00:43:48,160 --> 00:43:49,160
Stop hiding.

736
00:43:49,160 --> 00:43:50,160
Come out.

737
00:44:13,160 --> 00:44:14,160
I'm sorry.

738
00:44:43,160 --> 00:44:44,160
I'm sorry.

739
00:45:13,160 --> 00:45:14,160
I'm sorry.
