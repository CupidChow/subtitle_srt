Father.

5
00:04:30,790 --> 00:04:31,590
Ms. Pei,

6
00:04:31,940 --> 00:04:34,270
you were also a member of the Chongwu Camp.

7
00:04:34,830 --> 00:04:36,820
Why are you fighting against me?

8
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:39,530
People of different aspirations can't get along.

9
00:04:39,530 --> 00:04:41,190
Since you want to kill people,

10
00:04:41,270 --> 00:04:42,390
I should kill you!

11
00:04:49,870 --> 00:04:52,180
You're just a mere mortal.

12
00:04:52,830 --> 00:04:54,550
How will you kill me?

13
00:04:55,260 --> 00:04:56,700
Here,

14
00:04:57,350 --> 00:04:59,610
my power is endless.

15
00:05:12,150 --> 00:05:13,140

00:05:13,330 --> 00:05:15,460
You can't hold on much longer, can you?

17
00:05:15,830 --> 00:05:17,360
Mortals

18
00:05:17,640 --> 00:05:19,580

19
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:42,800

33

Have you ever had a nightmare?

34
00:08:56,170 --> 00:08:57,400
A nightmare is

35
00:08:58,680 --> 00:09:00,520
when what you think is over

36
00:09:02,420 --> 00:09:04,700
is actually just the beginning.

37
00:09:11,590 --> 00:09:12,750
Wen Xiao

38
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:15,680
and Pei Sijing are already dead too.

39
00:09:16,870 --> 00:09:18,070
I don't believe it.

40
00:09:18,670 --> 00:09:21,470
Turn around and take a look if you don't believe me.

41
00:09:22,350 --> 00:09:23,350
Impossible.

42
00:09:24,930 --> 00:09:25,910
Impossible.

43
00:10:32,350 --> 00:10:34,490
You're the only one left now.

44
00:10:35,790 --> 00:10:36,920
Are you lonely?

45
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:39,400
Are you afraid?

46
00:10:50,590 --> 00:10:51,810
Jiu, don't worry.

47
00:10:52,230 --> 00:10:53,340
As long as you need,

48
00:10:53,490 --> 00:10:54,830
I'll come to you.

49
00:10:55,160 --> 00:10:57,290
Then I'll always take the bell with me,

50
00:10:58,500 --> 00:11:00,490
so that you can find me anytime.

51
00:11:34,590 --> 00:11:35,430
No.

52
00:11:38,590 --> 00:11:39,950
This Jiu is fake.

53
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:45,000
He doesn't have the bell.

54
00:11:50,590 --> 00:11:51,440
So,

55
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:55,340
this is a dream.

56
00:11:59,510 --> 00:12:01,080
I'm still in the dream.

57
00:12:17,630 --> 00:12:19,030
As long as I kill myself

58
00:12:20,830 --> 00:12:22,360

59
00:12:26,030 --> 00:12:27,770

Wake up now!

69
00:13:08,110 --> 00:13:09,560
It's useless.

70
00:13:09,870 --> 00:13:12,330
No one can wake up from a Dream of Indulgence.

71
00:13:12,660 --> 00:13:15,390
And it's different from a dream created by Ran Yi.

72
00:13:16,170 --> 00:13:18,120
If he dies in the dream,

73
00:13:19,300 --> 00:13:21,730
he'll die in real life too.

♫Scattered traces remain♫

174
00:25:25,090 --> 00:25:32,820
♫The riddle of time♫

175
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:41,630
♫The joy and sorrow of life♫

176
00:25:43,150 --> 00:25:47,240
♫A few hasty lines♫

177
00:25:49,150 --> 00:25:56,820
♫Addressing love and hate♫

178
00:26:00,800 --> 00:26:08,470
♫Addressing love and hate♫

179
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:11,000
Brother Zhuo!

180
00:26:13,260 --> 00:26:13,870
Brother Zhuo!

181
00:26:13,870 --> 00:26:14,230
Jiu!

182
00:26:14,230 --> 00:26:14,550
Brother Zhuo!

183
00:26:14,550 --> 00:26:14,910
Wake up!

184
00:26:14,910 --> 00:26:15,440
What are you doing here?

185
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:15,950
Brother Zhuo!

186
00:26:15,950 --> 00:26:16,750
Brother Zhuo.

187
00:26:16,840 --> 00:26:18,030
Brother Zhuo, wake up.

188
00:26:18,030 --> 00:26:18,830
Brother Zhuo.

189
00:26:18,940 --> 00:26:19,870
Brother Zhuo.

190
00:26:20,470 --> 00:26:21,920
Brother Zhuo, wake up!

191
00:26:31,830 --> 00:26:32,630
Brother Zhuo!

192
00:26:32,770 --> 00:26:33,510
Can you hear me?

193
00:26:33,510 --> 00:26:34,310
Brother Zhuo!

194
00:26:34,580 --> 00:26:35,320
Jiu!

195
00:26:35,400 --> 00:26:36,500
Go back to the Demon Hunting Bureau now!

196
00:26:36,500 --> 00:26:37,250
It's too dangerous here!

197
00:26:37,250 --> 00:26:39,970
I stole two of Bi Fang's feathers from the Chongwu Camp.

198
00:26:39,970 --> 00:26:41,630
Just like the Shanhai Portal,

199
00:26:41,650 --> 00:26:43,120
it can take you anywhere.

200
00:26:43,150 --> 00:26:45,760
I was worried you and Brother Zhuo wouldn't give up although you're no match for him.

201
00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:47,460
The Bi Fang's feathers are a pair.

202
00:26:47,460 --> 00:26:48,770
The people holding the feathers

203
00:26:48,770 --> 00:26:50,200
can be teleported to each other's location.

204
00:26:50,200 --> 00:26:50,780
Okay.

205
00:26:53,290 --> 00:26:54,320
You take it.

206
00:26:54,350 --> 00:26:55,810
Go back to the Demon Hunting Bureau now.

207
00:26:55,810 --> 00:26:56,860
I promise you.

208
00:26:56,880 --> 00:26:58,180
If we are in danger,

209
00:26:58,200 --> 00:27:00,250
I'll take Zhuo back to you immediately.

210
00:27:00,250 --> 00:27:01,230
Go back to the Demon Hunting Bureau and wait for us.

211
00:27:01,230 --> 00:27:01,880
But Brother Zhuo...

212
00:27:01,880 --> 00:27:02,670
Go back now!

213
00:27:31,080 --> 00:27:31,990
Brother Zhuo.

214
00:27:32,170 --> 00:27:33,340
Brother Zhuo.

215
00:27:33,710 --> 00:27:34,510
You're awake.

216
00:27:44,810 --> 00:27:46,350
Just now in my dream,

217
00:27:47,940 --> 00:27:49,300
I saw a cloud

218
00:27:50,150 --> 00:27:51,500
of cyan light.

219
00:27:54,970 --> 00:27:56,630
It was Qing Geng's inner core.

220
00:28:02,780 --> 00:28:03,750
Fortunately,

221
00:28:05,780 --> 00:28:07,340
I woke you up.

222
00:28:22,730 --> 00:28:23,850
Qing Geng.

223
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:26,500
I can finally

224
00:28:27,550 --> 00:28:30,070
be with him.

225
00:28:32,680 --> 00:28:34,560
I can be with you forever.

226
00:28:45,810 --> 00:28:46,790
Qing Geng.

227
00:29:57,070 --> 00:29:59,480
Back then, I was blinded

228
00:30:00,060 --> 00:30:02,250
and deceived by you.

229
00:30:02,760 --> 00:30:04,090
Now,

230
00:30:04,440 --> 00:30:06,500
let me see

231
00:30:06,900 --> 00:30:09,340
what on earth you are.

232
00:30:29,290 --> 00:30:31,280
The Truth Eye.

233
00:30:46,540 --> 00:30:48,470
The inner core is in his left elbow.

234
00:30:49,340 --> 00:30:51,370
You want to destroy my inner core?

235
00:30:52,260 --> 00:30:54,310
Dream on.

236
00:30:58,430 --> 00:31:00,080
The Ever-Burning Wood?

237
00:31:01,990 --> 00:31:03,560
Li Lun, the pagoda ghost,

238
00:31:03,920 --> 00:31:05,230
aren't you afraid?

239
00:31:55,610 --> 00:31:56,760
Brother Zhuo!

240
00:32:04,440 --> 00:32:05,780
We can't protect you.

241
00:32:05,900 --> 00:32:06,760
Jiu,

242
00:32:06,790 --> 00:32:07,770
go now!

243
00:32:08,750 --> 00:32:13,900
♫Has anyone seen a bird with a broken tail?♫

244

I'm...

257
00:34:58,460 --> 00:35:00,030
going to kill you.

258
00:35:01,030 --> 00:35:02,880
You actually...

259
00:35:19,070 --> 00:35:20,680
I told you...

260
00:35:22,700 --> 00:35:24,680
I can do it.

261
00:35:32,910 --> 00:35:34,030
Jing.

262
00:36:20,500 --> 00:36:21,530
Don't kill her!

263
00:36:21,770 --> 00:36:22,790
If you want to kill her,

264
00:36:22,790 --> 00:36:23,950
kill me first.

265
00:36:24,860 --> 00:36:25,660
Jiu,

266
00:36:28,830 --> 00:36:29,760
get out of my way.

267
00:36:42,890 --> 00:36:44,400
You're a mortal.

268
00:36:45,360 --> 00:36:47,260
You can't possibly defeat me.

269
00:36:47,660 --> 00:36:48,710
No.

270
00:36:50,010 --> 00:36:51,540
In this illusion,

271
00:36:53,550 --> 00:36:55,980
you are just the fear in my heart.

272
00:38:27,710 --> 00:38:29,170
What else do you want to do?

273
00:38:30,240 --> 00:38:32,530
Don't you think you've done enough evil?

a mortal

310
