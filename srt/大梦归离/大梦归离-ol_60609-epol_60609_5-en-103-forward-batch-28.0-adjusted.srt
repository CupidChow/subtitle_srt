[Episode 5]

3
00:02:27,990 --> 00:02:28,790
Sister,

4
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:33,240
why do you want to kill me?

5
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:42,620
Sister,

6
00:02:44,670 --> 00:02:46,170
you misunderstood me.

7
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:49,700
Brother,

8
00:02:50,750 --> 00:02:52,810
you're unforgivable.

9
00:02:54,130 --> 00:02:55,620
Don't blame me.

10
00:03:36,790 --> 00:03:38,720
You actually have the guts to come.

11
00:03:39,310 --> 00:03:40,400
If I didn't come,

12
00:03:40,670 --> 00:03:42,160
they would be in danger.

13
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:43,830
You colluded with Ran Yi.

14
00:03:43,870 --> 00:03:45,990
That's what put them in danger.

15
00:03:47,710 --> 00:03:48,510
Colluded?

16
00:03:49,270 --> 00:03:51,420
Mr. Zhuo, your words are so harsh.

17
00:03:51,730 --> 00:03:53,630
Ran Yi and I just collaborated

18
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:55,460
to get what we need.

19
00:03:55,650 --> 00:03:57,710
When you came to the Demon Hunting Bureau,

20
00:03:57,710 --> 00:03:59,950
you also said you wanted to collaborate with us.

21
00:03:59,950 --> 00:04:02,260
Which part of what you said

22
00:04:02,350 --> 00:04:03,690
is true?

23
00:04:04,230 --> 00:04:06,030
Mr. Zhuo, every word I said to you

24
00:04:06,030 --> 00:04:07,930
is true.

25
00:04:08,140 --> 00:04:09,850
I only lie to little girls.

26
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:10,910
Nonsense.

27
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:15,310
You...

28
00:04:17,430 --> 00:04:19,910
I can tell you the details.

29
00:04:20,070 --> 00:04:21,579
But if we don't save them now,

30
00:04:21,579 --> 00:04:23,030
it'll be too late.

31
00:04:51,870 --> 00:04:54,680
Then... how can we deal with Ran Yi?

32
00:04:55,030 --> 00:04:58,030
Actually, there's another way, which is the easiest.

33
00:04:59,070 --> 00:05:00,500
Make the dreamers

34
00:05:00,990 --> 00:05:02,570
die in their dreams.

35
00:05:02,750 --> 00:05:03,850
So easy?

36
00:05:03,990 --> 00:05:05,650
They can just commit suicide.

37
00:05:05,830 --> 00:05:07,750
Committing suicide is indeed easy,

38
00:05:07,750 --> 00:05:09,250
but not everyone

39
00:05:09,470 --> 00:05:11,200
has the guts to commit suicide.

40
00:05:12,110 --> 00:05:13,550
Will you commit suicide now?

41
00:05:13,550 --> 00:05:15,140
Why would I commit suicide?

42
00:05:15,310 --> 00:05:17,470
I'm not in a dream created by Ran Yi.

43
00:05:17,830 --> 00:05:19,030
Are you sure?

44
00:05:19,570 --> 00:05:21,090
How can you be sure?

45
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:49,450
Looks like you've started to understand.

46
00:05:50,110 --> 00:05:51,500
If there's something

47
00:05:51,670 --> 00:05:53,990
that can penetrate the dreams created by Ran Yi,

48
00:05:53,990 --> 00:05:54,790
maybe...

49
00:05:54,790 --> 00:05:56,030
As far as I know,

50
00:05:56,830 --> 00:05:57,960
nothing can do that.

51
00:06:12,070 --> 00:06:13,370
The Cloud Light Sword

52
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:14,830
can kill demons and evil spirits.

53
00:06:14,830 --> 00:06:16,760
It won't be tainted by evil spirits

54
00:06:16,870 --> 00:06:19,820
and can break all the illusions in the world.

55
00:08:06,550 --> 00:08:09,080
Why can't Wen Xiao hear the sound of the sword?

56
00:08:14,390 --> 00:08:15,190
Forget it.

57
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:18,360
I'll go look for her in the dream.

58
00:09:11,070 --> 00:09:12,280
Don't be afraid.

59
00:09:14,370 --> 00:09:15,700
Demons and evil spirits

60
00:09:16,040 --> 00:09:17,670
are just illusions.

61
00:09:17,870 --> 00:09:20,020
Everything is not real.

62
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:21,800
You just need to wake up.

63
00:09:25,230 --> 00:09:27,120
What should I do to wake up?

64
00:09:29,430 --> 00:09:30,510
To wake up...

65
00:10:22,730 --> 00:10:23,850
That was...

66
00:10:34,170 --> 00:10:35,570
A dream created by Ran Yi.

67
00:10:49,390 --> 00:10:51,020
You didn't fall into a dream?

68
00:10:54,750 --> 00:10:56,490
I don't know why either.

69
00:10:59,900 --> 00:11:00,740
Ms. Pei.

70
00:11:03,510 --> 00:11:04,610
What's going on?

71
00:11:06,490 --> 00:11:09,550
This is the backfire from Ran Yi's dream control magic.

72
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:11,090
Dreamers

73
00:11:11,540 --> 00:11:13,760
having a stronger obsession with the illusions in their dreams

74
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:15,240
would suffer

75
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:16,780
greater physical damage.

76
00:11:19,470 --> 00:11:21,390
How come I haven't been affected?

77
00:11:23,750 --> 00:11:24,760
My obsession...

78
00:11:28,030 --> 00:11:29,400
It's indeed very strange.

79
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:31,260
Even Ms. Pei, who has practiced martial arts for years,

80
00:11:31,260 --> 00:11:32,590
failed to withstand it.

81
00:11:33,230 --> 00:11:35,290
You've always been physically weak,

82
00:11:35,380 --> 00:11:36,870
but you're fine this time.

83
00:11:43,530 --> 00:11:44,710
Zhao Yuanzhou,

84
00:11:44,990 --> 00:11:47,220
now we should have a good talk.

85
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:49,770
The one you should talk to is not me,

86
00:11:52,730 --> 00:11:53,970
but Ran Yi.

87
00:11:56,840 --> 00:11:58,220
He really is here.

88
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:01,710
Don't waste time.

89
00:12:01,970 --> 00:12:03,870
Let's go find him.

90
00:12:07,210 --> 00:12:08,160
Ms. Pei!

91
00:12:09,790 --> 00:12:10,960
What's wrong?

92
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:17,960
I'll take you to Ran Yi.

93
00:12:17,980 --> 00:12:19,700
But Ms. Pei, stop acting tough.

94
00:12:19,700 --> 00:12:21,240
Just stay here.

95
00:12:21,260 --> 00:12:22,920
Save us some trouble.

96
00:12:23,790 --> 00:12:24,590
I can't just let them

97
00:12:24,590 --> 00:12:25,850
go with you.

98
00:12:26,680 --> 00:12:27,310
Who knows

99
00:12:27,310 --> 00:12:29,690
if you'll lure them into another trap?

100
00:12:46,490 --> 00:12:48,260
When I had nightmares,

101
00:12:49,300 --> 00:12:51,710
my father would always write different Chinese characters

102
00:12:51,710 --> 00:12:53,290
in my palm.

103
00:12:53,870 --> 00:12:56,070
He said as long as I held onto it tightly,

104
00:12:56,490 --> 00:12:58,370
it would dispel the bad dreams.

105
00:13:04,100 --> 00:13:04,950
Don't worry.

106
00:13:05,560 --> 00:13:07,670
I have a way to deal with the great demon.

107
00:13:07,670 --> 00:13:09,070
Everything will be fine.

108
00:13:12,780 --> 00:13:14,910
You always had nightmares in the past?

109
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:25,510
Jiu asked me

110
00:13:25,670 --> 00:13:27,870
to take this bottle of medicine with me.

111
00:13:28,190 --> 00:13:29,250
Take it.

112
00:13:29,390 --> 00:13:31,720
It should help with your internal injury.

113
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:44,410
Thank you.

114
00:13:50,460 --> 00:13:51,740
Well, well, well.

115
00:13:51,990 --> 00:13:53,470
You're helping each other.

116
00:13:53,470 --> 00:13:55,530
You guys share a deep bond.

117
00:13:55,870 --> 00:13:57,770
You're doing this in front of me, huh?

118
00:13:57,770 --> 00:13:59,230
You think I'll lose to you?

119
00:14:09,080 --> 00:14:09,960
Protect.

120
00:14:14,310 --> 00:14:16,510
This barrier can protect her.

121
00:14:16,540 --> 00:14:18,210
It's much more practical than

122
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:19,890
your Chinese character

123
00:14:20,290 --> 00:14:21,370
and your medicine.

124
00:14:22,270 --> 00:14:22,830
You...

125
00:14:23,310 --> 00:14:24,390
Let's go.

126
00:15:44,870 --> 00:15:46,130
The Cloud Light Sword.

127
00:15:49,330 --> 00:15:51,290
It's been over ten years.

128
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:54,290
I didn't expect to see it again.

129
00:15:55,190 --> 00:15:56,460
Over ten years?

130
00:15:57,930 --> 00:15:59,250
You know my brother?

131
00:16:01,540 --> 00:16:02,880
More than ten years ago,

132
00:16:03,280 --> 00:16:04,790
I came to the mortal world.

133
00:16:05,020 --> 00:16:07,940
I met a man holding the Cloud Light Sword.

134
00:16:08,190 --> 00:16:09,350
He saved me.

135
00:16:11,550 --> 00:16:13,310
It turns out he is your brother.

136
00:16:14,020 --> 00:16:16,370
But the Cloud Light Sword he was holding

137
00:16:16,790 --> 00:16:19,120
was not as powerful as the one in your hand.

138
00:16:19,830 --> 00:16:21,400
He told me

139
00:16:21,450 --> 00:16:23,370
he had a beloved younger brother

140
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:26,200
haunted by nightmares every night.

141
00:16:27,190 --> 00:16:28,850
He asked me if I could help him.

142
00:16:30,270 --> 00:16:32,180
I gave him a scale of mine,

143
00:16:32,590 --> 00:16:36,120
telling him to grind it into powder and mix it with water to take.

144
00:16:36,150 --> 00:16:36,990
After that,

145
00:16:37,190 --> 00:16:38,070
his younger brother

146
00:16:38,070 --> 00:16:40,220
was no longer troubled by nightmares

147
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:42,580
and was no longer afraid anymore.

148
00:16:44,230 --> 00:16:45,030
Brother,

149
00:16:46,470 --> 00:16:47,730
I dare not fall asleep.

150
00:16:49,590 --> 00:16:50,520
If I fall asleep,

151
00:16:50,590 --> 00:16:53,050
I would dream of myself turning into a demon.

152
00:16:54,130 --> 00:16:56,150
No one would play with me.

153
00:16:58,360 --> 00:16:59,430
It's okay.

154
00:17:00,640 --> 00:17:02,900
Dreams reflect the opposite of reality.

155
00:17:06,600 --> 00:17:07,890
I'm here.

156
00:17:08,980 --> 00:17:09,910
Don't be afraid.

157
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:15,170
♫Footsteps echo, one by one♫

158

I see.

168
00:17:50,530 --> 00:17:51,349
So, Zhuo,

169
00:17:51,349 --> 00:17:53,670
that's why you haven't dreamed

170
00:17:54,390 --> 00:17:55,430
all these years.

171
00:18:05,450 --> 00:18:07,090
You had a good brother.

172
00:18:09,550 --> 00:18:10,650
Unfortunately...

173
00:18:13,230 --> 00:18:14,440
I killed him.

174
00:18:20,630 --> 00:18:22,560
My brother didn't want me to dream.

175
00:18:24,390 --> 00:18:25,640
But Zhao Yuanzhou,

176
00:18:26,450 --> 00:18:27,940
you killed them.

177
00:18:28,650 --> 00:18:29,930
You have imprisoned me

178
00:18:30,470 --> 00:18:32,270
in a nightmare for so many years.

179
00:18:33,210 --> 00:18:35,010
When you kill me one day,

180
00:18:35,870 --> 00:18:38,130
you can wake up from the nightmare.

181
00:18:47,310 --> 00:18:49,130
But you know it's not today

182
00:18:50,010 --> 00:18:51,350
or now.

183
00:18:54,750 --> 00:18:56,060
Then tell me,

184
00:18:57,110 --> 00:18:58,770
why did you help Ran Yi?

185
00:19:01,090 --> 00:19:02,550
Interesting.

186
00:19:05,780 --> 00:19:07,700
You humans call it a virtue

187
00:19:09,070 --> 00:19:10,580
when you help one another.

188
00:19:11,110 --> 00:19:13,060
But for us demons,

189
00:19:13,090 --> 00:19:15,220
helping each other requires a reason.

190
00:19:15,740 --> 00:19:17,670
You always inflict harm on demons,

191
00:19:17,870 --> 00:19:20,670
but you can always come up with excuses.

192
00:19:22,310 --> 00:19:23,170
Zhao Yuanzhou,

193
00:19:24,070 --> 00:19:25,640
I told you this long ago.

194
00:19:25,870 --> 00:19:27,080
Humans and demons

195
00:19:27,190 --> 00:19:29,030
can never get along well.

196
00:19:31,470 --> 00:19:32,340
Really?

197
00:19:34,300 --> 00:19:35,030
Then why do you

198
00:19:35,030 --> 00:19:37,230
insist on being with Miss Qi?

199
00:19:42,510 --> 00:19:45,150
I told you Wen Xiao and Mr. Zhuo are smart.

200
00:19:45,870 --> 00:19:47,400
You can't hide it from them.

201
00:19:48,190 --> 00:19:49,230
Where's Miss Qi?

202
00:19:50,990 --> 00:19:52,830
My daughter was so frightened

203
00:19:52,830 --> 00:19:54,030
that she caught a cold.

204
00:19:54,030 --> 00:19:56,230
It's not convenient for her to meet you.

205
00:20:47,740 --> 00:20:49,180
Who are you guys?

206
00:20:51,110 --> 00:20:52,710
Why did you save me?

207
00:20:54,670 --> 00:20:56,620
Why didn't you let me die?

208
00:20:59,260 --> 00:21:00,560
It's easy to die,

209
00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:03,570
but it can't solve any problem.

210
00:21:05,030 --> 00:21:08,230
It will only hurt the feelings of those who care about you.

211
00:21:17,820 --> 00:21:19,470
In the boundless azure sea,

212
00:21:20,660 --> 00:21:22,110
there is no path.

213
00:21:23,590 --> 00:21:25,470
Yet in the mortal world,

214
00:21:28,610 --> 00:21:30,610
in the vastness of the starry river,

215
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:32,580
I hold your hand,

216
00:21:34,440 --> 00:21:36,570
traveling around the world together.

217
00:21:50,030 --> 00:21:53,030
The only person caring about me also died.

218
00:21:53,050 --> 00:21:55,050
Why should I live?

219
00:21:56,100 --> 00:21:57,350
Ran Yi Fish?

220
00:21:59,330 --> 00:22:00,860
Is the person you mentioned

221
00:22:01,160 --> 00:22:02,680
Ran Yi?

222
00:22:04,540 --> 00:22:06,160
You know him?

223
00:22:11,110 --> 00:22:12,230
He's not dead.

224
00:22:15,880 --> 00:22:17,700
We can take you to him.

225
00:22:20,190 --> 00:22:21,720
You actually put her in a sack?

226
00:22:21,720 --> 00:22:22,910
This is not Miss Qi.

227
00:22:23,790 --> 00:22:24,790
This is Master Qi.

228
00:22:29,030 --> 00:22:30,430
We just caught him

229
00:22:30,430 --> 00:22:32,690
and didn't have time to interrogate him.

230
00:22:33,110 --> 00:22:35,370
He's still in the dream created by Ran Yi.

231
00:22:36,750 --> 00:22:37,910
He deserves it.

232
00:22:39,550 --> 00:22:41,220
He can never wake up.

233
00:22:42,950 --> 00:22:44,310
Master Qi is guilty,

234
00:22:45,740 --> 00:22:48,680
but he should be convicted by the Demon Hunting Bureau.

235
00:22:48,680 --> 00:22:51,940
You demons can't abuse your power out of personal grudges.

236
00:22:52,900 --> 00:22:53,700
What?

237
00:22:54,710 --> 00:22:56,350
When he asked the demon hunter

238
00:22:56,350 --> 00:22:57,150
to perform the cruel

239
00:22:57,150 --> 00:22:59,820
corpse-dissolving and demon-subduing technique on me,

240
00:22:59,820 --> 00:23:01,720
wasn't he abusing his power?

241
00:23:01,910 --> 00:23:03,510
Why didn't you mention that?

242
00:23:05,740 --> 00:23:07,740
Why is the incense burner so smelly?

243
00:23:12,570 --> 00:23:13,470
This is...

244
00:23:14,370 --> 00:23:16,570
the smell of the Demon Slaying Spell.

245
00:23:27,860 --> 00:23:30,990
The corpse-dissolving and demon-subduing technique.

246
00:23:31,630 --> 00:23:34,120
Crush a dragon's rib bones into powder,

247
00:23:34,460 --> 00:23:36,120
soak it in lime water,

248
00:23:36,440 --> 00:23:38,050
and dry it into incense.

249
00:23:39,080 --> 00:23:40,150
After it's burnt,

250
00:23:40,950 --> 00:23:42,550
it can kill aquatic animals.

251
00:23:51,590 --> 00:23:53,250
I promised Miss Qi

252
00:23:53,550 --> 00:23:55,150
to take her to the Wilderness

253
00:23:55,470 --> 00:23:56,970
to see the Tree of Heaven

254
00:23:57,630 --> 00:23:59,030
and the shores of the sea.

255
00:24:01,990 --> 00:24:03,590
In the boundless azure sea,

256
00:24:05,170 --> 00:24:06,510
there is no path.

257
00:24:09,790 --> 00:24:10,950
Yet

258
00:24:13,070 --> 00:24:14,330
in the mortal world...

259
00:24:32,290 --> 00:24:33,850

[In the boundless azure sea, there is no path. Yet in the mortal world, in the vastness of the starry river, I hold your hand, traveling around the world together.]

I'll take you away.

Where to?

290
00:25:55,770 --> 00:25:57,550
I'll take you to the Wilderness,

291
00:25:57,550 --> 00:25:59,350
although it's a desolate place.

292
00:25:59,410 --> 00:26:00,840
No place

293
00:26:00,950 --> 00:26:02,550
is more desolate than this world.

294
00:26:02,550 --> 00:26:03,270
Master,

295
00:26:03,290 --> 00:26:03,930
bad news!

296
00:26:03,960 --> 00:26:05,220
Miss Qi ran away with the doctor!

297
00:26:05,220 --> 00:26:05,750
This way.

298
00:26:13,140 --> 00:26:14,440
I'm a demon hunter!

299
00:26:14,470 --> 00:26:15,190
Demon!

300
00:26:15,210 --> 00:26:16,640
Show your true form!

301
00:27:01,870 --> 00:27:03,010
My Lady!

302
00:27:04,060 --> 00:27:04,790
I'll marry that man.

303
00:27:04,790 --> 00:27:05,920
I'll marry that man!

304
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:06,470
Father!

305
00:27:06,470 --> 00:27:07,120
Father!

306
00:27:07,310 --> 00:27:08,350
Let him go!

307
00:27:08,350 --> 00:27:09,590
I'll marry that man!

308
00:27:10,230 --> 00:27:11,390
No!

309
00:27:35,490 --> 00:27:37,850
To prevent me from going back to Miss Qi,

310
00:27:38,230 --> 00:27:42,710
he kept the corpse-dissolving and demon-subduing incense burnt in the mansion.

311
00:27:42,710 --> 00:27:44,320
I couldn't save her.

312
00:27:45,790 --> 00:27:47,690
So you ran away, seriously injured

313
00:27:47,690 --> 00:27:49,550
and with little time left to live.

314
00:27:49,630 --> 00:27:50,990
In order to restore your demon power,

315
00:27:50,990 --> 00:27:54,250
you could only absorb malicious energy by killing people.

316
00:27:54,750 --> 00:27:55,980
Also,

317
00:27:56,110 --> 00:27:57,680
you deliberately preyed on brides

318
00:27:57,680 --> 00:27:58,970
and created panic,

319
00:27:59,210 --> 00:28:00,920
making people dare not get married.

320
00:28:00,920 --> 00:28:04,780
You did everything in an attempt to stop Miss Qi from getting married.

321
00:28:05,500 --> 00:28:07,220
I could stop anyone,

322
00:28:07,590 --> 00:28:08,670
but I couldn't stop

323
00:28:08,670 --> 00:28:10,350
her despicable father.

324
00:28:11,430 --> 00:28:13,350
It's God's will that he

325
00:28:14,260 --> 00:28:15,700
ended up like this.

326
00:28:19,060 --> 00:28:19,830
I don't know how

327
00:28:19,830 --> 00:28:21,630
to undo the dream control magic.

328
00:28:22,750 --> 00:28:24,010
And it can't be undone.

329
00:28:27,610 --> 00:28:29,010
It's very easy to undo it.

330
00:28:30,160 --> 00:28:31,200
Cut a piece

331
00:28:31,240 --> 00:28:31,910
of your flesh

332
00:28:31,910 --> 00:28:33,400
and make him eat it.

333
00:28:40,710 --> 00:28:42,260
Don't bother.

334
00:28:42,710 --> 00:28:44,060
I'll wake him up.

335
00:28:53,270 --> 00:28:55,990
Give my life back to me.

336
00:28:57,530 --> 00:28:59,410
It's so cold down here.

337
00:28:59,990 --> 00:29:01,950
Come and accompany me.

338
00:29:03,410 --> 00:29:04,820
Leave me alone.

339
00:29:04,850 --> 00:29:06,860
You should go to that demon.

340
00:29:07,150 --> 00:29:09,360
You helped my daughter elope with him.

341
00:29:09,730 --> 00:29:11,260
You deserved to die!

342
00:29:19,070 --> 00:29:21,880
You do deserve to die!

343
00:29:23,640 --> 00:29:24,560
Wake up.

344
00:29:32,120 --> 00:29:33,660
Don't... Don't kill me!

345
00:29:33,920 --> 00:29:35,650
Don't... Don't come near me!

346
00:29:35,790 --> 00:29:36,820
Neither do you!

347
00:29:37,720 --> 00:29:39,920
Don't... Don't come near me. All of you.

348
00:29:41,180 --> 00:29:42,290
I didn't kill you.

349
00:29:42,320 --> 00:29:43,160
Don't come near me!

350
00:29:43,160 --> 00:29:44,280
Don't come near me!

351
00:29:44,300 --> 00:29:45,290
He's gone crazy.

352
00:29:45,330 --> 00:29:46,040
Go away!

353
00:29:46,060 --> 00:29:47,540
It has nothing to do with me.

354
00:29:47,540 --> 00:29:48,770
I didn't kill you.

355
00:29:48,990 --> 00:29:49,310
I didn't...

356
00:29:49,310 --> 00:29:50,030
Quiet.

357
00:29:54,830 --> 00:29:56,640
It was really him who killed them and buried the bodies.

358
00:29:56,640 --> 00:29:57,870
When my Cloud Light Sword

359
00:29:57,870 --> 00:29:59,450
was glimmering in Qi's Mansion,

360
00:29:59,450 --> 00:30:01,850
I felt something was wrong with that place.

361
00:30:37,630 --> 00:30:39,410
It was once a well.

362
00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:40,970
He moved a tree there

363
00:30:40,990 --> 00:30:42,450
to cover the well's mouth.

364
00:30:42,900 --> 00:30:44,180
But beneath the tree

365
00:30:44,200 --> 00:30:45,870
lies a hollow, deep well.

366
00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:48,210
The roots couldn't get any nutrients.

367
00:30:48,220 --> 00:30:49,170
As a result,

368
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:50,260
the tree withered.

369
00:30:56,390 --> 00:30:57,310
One.

370
00:30:58,350 --> 00:30:59,280
Two.

371
00:31:00,040 --> 00:31:00,690
Three.

372
00:31:01,390 --> 00:31:02,110
Four.

373
00:31:03,090 --> 00:31:03,960
Five.

374
00:31:05,230 --> 00:31:06,900
All the five bodies in the well

375
00:31:07,320 --> 00:31:08,780
have been pulled out of it.

376
00:31:11,940 --> 00:31:13,390
The people in the well

377
00:31:13,430 --> 00:31:14,230
were the servants

378
00:31:14,230 --> 00:31:16,750
who wanted to help me elope with Miss Qi.

379
00:31:17,620 --> 00:31:18,830
To him, killing them

380
00:31:20,380 --> 00:31:22,430
was like killing a few ants.

381
00:31:25,500 --> 00:31:27,900
They must have died with great resentment.

382
00:31:28,670 --> 00:31:30,640
The greater resentment they died with,

383
00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:33,090
the more malicious energy there should be in the courtyard.

384
00:31:33,090 --> 00:31:33,800
But

385
00:31:34,010 --> 00:31:35,140
my Cloud Light Sword

386
00:31:35,170 --> 00:31:37,200
only sensed a faint trace of it.

387
00:31:38,130 --> 00:31:40,320
This has aroused my suspicion.

388
00:31:43,210 --> 00:31:44,060
Someone

389
00:31:44,270 --> 00:31:46,070
absorbed the malicious energy.

390
00:31:52,130 --> 00:31:53,990
Are you suspecting me?

391
00:31:55,120 --> 00:31:56,710
I'm not suspecting you.

392
00:31:57,070 --> 00:31:58,830
I'm sure it was you.

393
00:32:01,370 --> 00:32:02,850
Before you went to the Demon Hunting Bureau

394
00:32:02,850 --> 00:32:04,840
to tell us you would help us catch Ran Yi,

395
00:32:04,840 --> 00:32:06,980
you had already been to Qi's Mansion

396
00:32:07,010 --> 00:32:09,270
and found out Ran Yi committed the crime.

397
00:32:09,520 --> 00:32:10,740
A servant of Qi's Mansion

398
00:32:10,740 --> 00:32:11,510
said that a few days ago,

399
00:32:11,510 --> 00:32:12,740
he saw a ghost

400
00:32:12,740 --> 00:32:14,450
on the tree in the courtyard.

401
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:17,520
Who is it?

402
00:32:18,750 --> 00:32:20,020
Who's there?

403
00:32:30,810 --> 00:32:32,010
Ghost!

404
00:32:33,190 --> 00:32:35,630
That ghost had a pair of red eyes.

405
00:32:35,790 --> 00:32:36,620
I think it was you,

406
00:32:36,620 --> 00:32:37,420
right?

407
00:32:37,960 --> 00:32:39,060
Zhao Yuanzhou.

408
00:32:42,410 --> 00:32:43,400
At that time,

409
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:45,480
you absorbed the malicious energy in the well

410
00:32:45,480 --> 00:32:47,130
and discovered everything.

411
00:32:47,450 --> 00:32:49,650
Then you started to carry out your plan.

412
00:33:16,280 --> 00:33:17,340
Zhu Yan,

413
00:33:18,030 --> 00:33:20,360
I won't go back to the Wilderness with you.

414
00:33:20,770 --> 00:33:22,640
The Baize Token has been lost.

415
00:33:23,760 --> 00:33:26,150
Why are you being nosy here?

416
00:33:28,260 --> 00:33:31,120
Who said I'm here to take you back to the Wilderness?

417
00:33:32,410 --> 00:33:34,060
I'm here to help you.

418
00:33:35,110 --> 00:33:36,370
You offered

419
00:33:36,400 --> 00:33:39,010
to help him put the Water Ghost's wedding letter

420
00:33:39,010 --> 00:33:40,220
in Qi's Mansion.

421
00:33:41,170 --> 00:33:42,590
You don't need to deny it.

422
00:33:43,660 --> 00:33:44,920
On the wedding letter,

423
00:33:44,930 --> 00:33:46,930
there was familiar demonic energy,

424
00:33:47,180 --> 00:33:49,110
which is annoying.

425
00:33:52,010 --> 00:33:54,610
Mr. Zhuo, I didn't expect you to be so familiar

426
00:33:54,630 --> 00:33:55,990
with my demonic energy.

427
00:33:57,770 --> 00:33:59,830
Indeed, I placed the wedding letter.

428
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:26,160
[Wedding Letter]

429
00:34:40,449 --> 00:34:42,040
Unexpectedly,

430
00:34:42,320 --> 00:34:44,770
Master Qi disregarded familial bonds.

431
00:34:46,719 --> 00:34:48,340
But I'm curious.

432
00:34:48,630 --> 00:34:51,199
Why didn't you take Miss Qi to him directly?

433
00:34:51,219 --> 00:34:53,210
Why did you make such a long detour?

434
00:34:55,370 --> 00:34:57,179
I was too ashamed to see her.

435
00:34:59,870 --> 00:35:01,530
I killed so many people.

436
00:35:02,909 --> 00:35:04,360
I'm guilty.

437
00:35:06,070 --> 00:35:07,739
But she is kind-hearted.

438
00:35:08,440 --> 00:35:10,000
She must care a lot

439
00:35:10,949 --> 00:35:12,630
about what I did.

440
00:35:13,530 --> 00:35:14,230
I just hope

441
00:35:14,230 --> 00:35:15,110
she won't be forced

442
00:35:15,110 --> 00:35:17,219
to marry someone she doesn't like.

443
00:35:21,900 --> 00:35:24,780
I hope she can live the life she wants.

444
00:35:26,320 --> 00:35:28,380
I'll take her here

445
00:35:29,440 --> 00:35:31,220
so that you can elope together.

446
00:35:32,560 --> 00:35:33,650
Isn't it good?

447
00:35:37,020 --> 00:35:38,620
I'm a sinful man.

448
00:35:40,120 --> 00:35:42,720
I don't know how to face all the promises I made.

449
00:35:44,330 --> 00:35:45,400
I just hope she

450
00:35:45,730 --> 00:35:47,270
can consider it a dream.

451
00:35:48,930 --> 00:35:50,590
The road is muddy in the dream.

452
00:35:50,890 --> 00:35:52,890
She'll see light after she wakes up.

453
00:35:53,180 --> 00:35:54,790
The world is desolate.

454
00:35:56,330 --> 00:35:57,870
Take care.

455
00:36:08,630 --> 00:36:10,580
You are so affectionate.

456
00:36:13,110 --> 00:36:15,370
You've become more and more like a human.

457
00:36:19,800 --> 00:36:21,420
What about you?

458
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:25,830
You won't help me for no reason.

459
00:36:27,030 --> 00:36:28,390
What do you want?

460
00:36:33,150 --> 00:36:34,640
Why exactly

461
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:36,720
did you help him?

462
00:36:38,500 --> 00:36:40,330
I told you long ago.

463
00:36:41,320 --> 00:36:42,850
I did it for the Baize Token.

464
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:45,880
The Baize Token?

465
00:36:46,670 --> 00:36:47,710
Some dreams

466
00:36:48,020 --> 00:36:50,500
can remind you of the past that has been forgotten.

467
00:36:50,500 --> 00:36:52,310
Zhao Yuanzhou asked me

468
00:36:52,340 --> 00:36:54,270
to create a dream like that for you.

469
00:37:03,300 --> 00:37:06,260
Is everything I saw in my dream

470
00:37:13,700 --> 00:37:14,820
real?

471
00:37:20,440 --> 00:37:21,580
Yes.

472
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:25,990
So you wanted Ran Yi

473
00:37:26,070 --> 00:37:27,380
to help me remember

474
00:37:27,410 --> 00:37:30,410
the whereabouts of the Baize Token through the dream?

475
00:37:32,560 --> 00:37:34,080
That was not a dream.

476
00:37:35,540 --> 00:37:36,970
It was your memory.

477
00:37:39,330 --> 00:37:41,730
But why was the memory missing from my mind?

478
00:37:54,850 --> 00:37:57,070
What did you see in the dream?

479
00:38:00,470 --> 00:38:01,770
I saw

480
00:38:02,670 --> 00:38:05,460
Master did give the Baize Token to me.

481
00:38:07,030 --> 00:38:10,030
There was indeed a Baize Mark on my forehead.

482
00:38:16,020 --> 00:38:17,110
Then how come

483
00:38:17,130 --> 00:38:19,670
you don't have Baize Divine Power at all?

484
00:38:27,550 --> 00:38:30,610
Maybe there's still something she hasn't remembered.

485
00:38:37,870 --> 00:38:39,040
Zhao Yuanzhou,

486
00:38:39,140 --> 00:38:40,720
I've fulfilled

487
00:38:40,760 --> 00:38:42,080
my promise to you.

488
00:38:42,340 --> 00:38:44,120
What about your promise to me?

489
00:38:47,990 --> 00:38:50,160
Master Qi has been punished.

490
00:38:51,630 --> 00:38:53,160
What about her freedom?

491
00:39:00,640 --> 00:39:01,740
Conjure.

492
00:39:16,910 --> 00:39:18,360
After tomorrow,

493
00:39:18,990 --> 00:39:20,030
everyone will think

494
00:39:20,030 --> 00:39:22,360
Miss Qi has been killed by the Water Ghost.

495
00:39:24,070 --> 00:39:25,110
She's free.

496
00:39:25,940 --> 00:39:28,250
She can go anywhere she wants.

497
00:39:31,040 --> 00:39:32,570
According to the book,

498
00:39:33,190 --> 00:39:34,850
the East Sea in the Wilderness

499
00:39:35,110 --> 00:39:36,840
has azure water and white sand.

500
00:39:40,630 --> 00:39:43,270
I really want to see it myself.

501
00:39:52,310 --> 00:39:53,270
Thank you.

502
00:39:56,520 --> 00:39:57,980
Since you've pled guilty,

503
00:39:58,000 --> 00:39:59,790
you should surrender

504
00:39:59,920 --> 00:40:02,520
and go back to the Demon Hunting Bureau with me.

505
00:40:03,640 --> 00:40:04,710
Someone is here.

506
00:40:32,270 --> 00:40:34,270
Didn't we hide her in the Archives?

507
00:40:34,870 --> 00:40:36,270
How did she come here?

508
00:40:36,960 --> 00:40:38,090
I didn't expect that

509
00:40:38,240 --> 00:40:39,370
you still came here.

510
00:40:54,140 --> 00:40:55,190
Where's Ran Yi?

511
00:41:02,010 --> 00:41:03,030
Zhuo, you...

512
00:41:04,870 --> 00:41:06,930
It can make sure she won't run around.

513
00:41:10,240 --> 00:41:11,120
Let's go.

514
00:41:36,040 --> 00:41:37,680
I know everything.

515
00:41:39,080 --> 00:41:41,010
Whether you're a human or a demon,

516
00:41:41,960 --> 00:41:43,550
no matter what you do,

517
00:41:45,550 --> 00:41:47,150
we'll live and die together,

518
00:41:48,010 --> 00:41:49,390
till death do us part.

519
00:42:13,210 --> 00:42:14,580
Let's leave together

520
00:42:14,830 --> 00:42:16,020
and go back to the Wilderness.

521
00:42:16,020 --> 00:42:16,810
Okay.

522
00:42:18,110 --> 00:42:20,450
You tried so hard to escape.

523
00:42:21,390 --> 00:42:22,840
Why do you want to go back?

524
00:42:25,070 --> 00:42:26,390
People say

525
00:42:27,430 --> 00:42:29,290
animals spend their entire lives

526
00:42:29,560 --> 00:42:32,890
seeking a roof to shelter them in order to eat and sleep well.

527
00:42:33,130 --> 00:42:34,570
But only humans

528
00:42:36,100 --> 00:42:38,370
yearn to return to their hometowns.

529
00:42:43,340 --> 00:42:45,570
I read a lot of books and wrote

530
00:42:46,690 --> 00:42:49,020
many Chinese characters with her before.

531
00:42:49,390 --> 00:42:52,320
But I still didn't understand what homesickness is.

532
00:42:53,610 --> 00:42:54,920
If it's sorrow,

533
00:42:56,360 --> 00:42:58,420
why do so many people pursue it?

534
00:43:00,550 --> 00:43:01,960
Now I understand.

535
00:43:03,160 --> 00:43:04,840
I don't want to be an animal.

536
00:43:05,030 --> 00:43:06,380
I want to be a human.

537
00:43:06,960 --> 00:43:08,870
What about those people you hurt?

538
00:43:10,020 --> 00:43:11,550
They wanted to be humans too.

539
00:43:11,550 --> 00:43:13,720
They also wanted to return to their hometowns.

540
00:43:13,720 --> 00:43:15,320
You committed heinous crimes,

541
00:43:15,320 --> 00:43:17,450
yet you still want to leave unscathed?

542
00:43:29,920 --> 00:43:31,780
Your brother saved me back then.

543
00:43:32,020 --> 00:43:33,820
But today, you want to arrest me.

544
00:43:34,700 --> 00:43:37,350
I've protected you from nightmares for many years.

545
00:43:37,350 --> 00:43:38,670
I did you a favor.

546
00:43:38,700 --> 00:43:40,350
Can't you just let us go?

547
00:43:40,790 --> 00:43:41,990
The one my brother

548
00:43:42,170 --> 00:43:44,520
saved back then was surely a kind demon,

549
00:43:44,540 --> 00:43:46,580
not you who killed innocent people.

550
00:43:46,950 --> 00:43:49,010
I will arrest you.

551
00:43:50,860 --> 00:43:52,700
The only thing I can do

552
00:43:53,250 --> 00:43:55,050
is to plead

553
00:43:56,170 --> 00:43:57,570
for your life.

554
00:43:58,270 --> 00:43:59,040
Yes.

555
00:44:02,710 --> 00:44:04,470
I killed innocent people.

556
00:44:05,860 --> 00:44:08,590
But I created the most beautiful dreams for them.

557
00:44:09,620 --> 00:44:11,280
Their lives

558
00:44:11,360 --> 00:44:13,470
were full of pain and restraints.

559
00:44:14,900 --> 00:44:17,370
I gave them the happiness they longed for.

560
00:44:19,720 --> 00:44:21,110
Longed for.

561
00:44:24,900 --> 00:44:26,780
Words invented by humans

562
00:44:26,980 --> 00:44:29,070
are perfectly apt sometimes.

563
00:44:30,800 --> 00:44:32,260
What is elusive in reality

564
00:44:34,040 --> 00:44:35,520
can be found in dreams.

565
00:44:38,740 --> 00:44:40,230
Life is

566
00:44:40,300 --> 00:44:42,500
like Zhuangzi and his butterfly dream.

567
00:44:42,750 --> 00:44:43,750
In the dreams,

568
00:44:44,070 --> 00:44:45,910
all their wishes came true.

569
00:44:46,630 --> 00:44:48,760
They lived their happy lives in the way

570
00:44:49,010 --> 00:44:50,830
they wanted the most.

571
00:44:52,270 --> 00:44:53,470
Isn't that good?

572
00:44:55,280 --> 00:44:57,080
Whether it's a dream or reality,

573
00:44:57,310 --> 00:44:59,640
it's not for you to decide on their behalf.

574
00:45:01,430 --> 00:45:02,630
I don't want to be a demon.

575
00:45:02,630 --> 00:45:03,710
I want to be a human.

576
00:45:04,100 --> 00:45:05,930
Who should decide it?

577
00:45:06,630 --> 00:45:07,620
You?

578
00:45:08,590 --> 00:45:10,150
Baize Goddess.

579
00:45:13,780 --> 00:45:15,840
Mayflies can see the sun and the moon,

580
00:45:16,210 --> 00:45:18,270
but she can only stay in her room,

581
00:45:18,450 --> 00:45:19,950
bound by the whims of fate.

582
00:45:20,040 --> 00:45:21,750
Who gave her a choice?

583
00:45:22,840 --> 00:45:24,300
Nature is not benevolent.

584
00:45:24,580 --> 00:45:26,630
It treats all things as sacrificial straw dogs.

585
00:45:26,630 --> 00:45:28,760
Just because nature is not benevolent,

586
00:45:28,760 --> 00:45:30,950
justice prevails

587
00:45:31,300 --> 00:45:32,840
beneath the weight of fate.

588
00:45:39,150 --> 00:45:41,610
How will the Demon Hunting Bureau punish me?

589
00:45:42,010 --> 00:45:44,350
Although Master Qi hurt you first,

590
00:45:45,300 --> 00:45:47,670
you killed dozens of people after all.

591
00:45:47,870 --> 00:45:49,130
You are unforgivable.

592
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:52,600
You'll be imprisoned for at least 1,000 years.

593
00:45:52,710 --> 00:45:53,790
1,000 years?

594
00:45:59,070 --> 00:46:01,100
You humans are so arrogant.

595
00:46:01,610 --> 00:46:02,790
For demons,

596
00:46:03,190 --> 00:46:04,400
it's bearable.

597
00:46:05,660 --> 00:46:07,150
But for humans,

598
00:46:09,020 --> 00:46:10,820
life is just a few short decades.

599
00:46:11,230 --> 00:46:12,390
In other words,

600
00:46:12,750 --> 00:46:13,910
I can't see you again

601
00:46:14,990 --> 00:46:16,950
even in the next life.

602
00:46:29,690 --> 00:46:31,270
I refuse to accept that.

603
00:46:32,260 --> 00:46:34,310
It's not up to you.
