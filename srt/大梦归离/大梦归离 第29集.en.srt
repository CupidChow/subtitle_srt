[Episode 29]

3
00:01:48,530 --> 00:01:49,930
Return the dragon scale!

4
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:56,680
That's because Ying Lei trusts you.

5
00:01:57,380 --> 00:01:59,240
He didn't expect you to lie to him.

6
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:01,340
Zhuo,

7
00:02:01,790 --> 00:02:03,120
what happened?

8
00:02:03,670 --> 00:02:05,500
He gave Ying Lei an empty box.

9
00:02:09,910 --> 00:02:10,789
But

10
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:13,470
Li Lun wants to stop us from fixing the sword so badly.

11
00:02:13,470 --> 00:02:16,000
He will definitely come for the dragon scale.

12
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:21,829
Seal.

13
00:02:21,829 --> 00:02:24,500
You and Li Lun know each other well.

14
00:02:24,620 --> 00:02:26,150
How can such a simple spell

15
00:02:26,610 --> 00:02:28,370
guard against Li Lun?

16
00:02:29,030 --> 00:02:30,690
You did it to guard against us.

17
00:02:32,070 --> 00:02:33,230
You were afraid we'd find out

18
00:02:33,230 --> 00:02:35,230
there was no dragon scale in the box.

19
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:37,510
I thought

20
00:02:37,710 --> 00:02:38,990
you took the dragon scale

21
00:02:38,990 --> 00:02:41,510
because you were worried about Ying Lei guarding it.

22
00:02:41,510 --> 00:02:43,200
I was afraid he'd attract trouble,

23
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:44,380
putting him

24
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:45,550
in danger,

25
00:02:46,260 --> 00:02:47,920
so I didn't mention it.

26
00:02:48,740 --> 00:02:50,350
But your reaction just now

27
00:02:50,890 --> 00:02:52,510
was obviously to mislead us.

28
00:02:53,990 --> 00:02:55,430
Now, the completely ignorant Ying Lei

29
00:02:55,430 --> 00:02:56,990
got into danger after chasing Ao Yin

30
00:02:56,990 --> 00:02:58,590
for an empty box.

31
00:02:59,220 --> 00:03:01,480
Are you still not going to tell the truth?

32
00:03:05,460 --> 00:03:06,480
Jiu.

33
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:09,440
My lord.

34
00:03:27,450 --> 00:03:28,250
Stop!

35
00:03:31,020 --> 00:03:33,820
I wonder if the organs of a half-demon and half-god

36
00:03:34,370 --> 00:03:36,500
would be more useful than human liver.

37
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:39,760
I did take the dragon scale.

38
00:03:41,860 --> 00:03:43,350
You sacrificed Ying Lei

39
00:03:44,470 --> 00:03:46,930
to attract the attention of Li Lun and Ao Yin.

40
00:03:48,670 --> 00:03:50,400
He wouldn't go to that extreme.

41
00:03:51,150 --> 00:03:53,350
You want the dragon scale for yourself?

42
00:03:54,700 --> 00:03:56,230
It's useless to you.

43
00:03:56,750 --> 00:03:58,150
What would you do with it?

44
00:03:58,590 --> 00:03:59,790
I have my own purpose.

45
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:02,270
But I can't tell you now.

46
00:04:09,270 --> 00:04:11,130
Ying Lei is Ying Zhao's grandson.

47
00:04:11,590 --> 00:04:14,180
Li Lun and Ying Zhao were old friends of many years.

48
00:04:14,180 --> 00:04:15,740
He won't do anything to him.

49
00:04:18,390 --> 00:04:19,190
A—

50
00:04:19,950 --> 00:04:20,910
Again...

51
00:04:47,630 --> 00:04:48,790
Free me!

52
00:04:48,990 --> 00:04:50,000
Free me!

53
00:04:50,070 --> 00:04:50,870
Undo your immobilization spell!

54
00:04:50,870 --> 00:04:51,430
Shut up!

55
00:04:51,940 --> 00:04:53,740
If it weren't for Ying Zhao,

56
00:04:54,510 --> 00:04:56,370
he would have killed you long ago.

57
00:04:57,230 --> 00:04:58,030
Jiu!

58
00:04:58,750 --> 00:05:00,160
Give Jiu back to me!

59
00:05:00,630 --> 00:05:02,010
You didn't get the dragon scale.

60
00:05:02,010 --> 00:05:03,700
Wait to get stripped away!

61
00:05:04,190 --> 00:05:04,750
Jiu,

62
00:05:04,780 --> 00:05:06,690
I will save you!

63
00:05:07,030 --> 00:05:07,830
So noisy.

64
00:05:08,110 --> 00:05:08,670
I...

65
00:05:27,190 --> 00:05:28,190
I heard

66
00:05:28,990 --> 00:05:30,570
you stole the dragon scale.

67
00:05:31,910 --> 00:05:32,870
I also heard that

68
00:05:34,110 --> 00:05:36,110
Lord Bai Yan took the Baize Token.

69
00:05:37,670 --> 00:05:38,750
You found out?

70
00:05:39,950 --> 00:05:41,350
There’s deadly poison

71
00:05:42,830 --> 00:05:44,560
on the Baize Token instrument,

72
00:05:44,870 --> 00:05:45,710
right?

73
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:51,040
You can hide it from Wen Xiao

74
00:05:51,940 --> 00:05:53,350
but not me.

75
00:05:56,150 --> 00:05:57,470
I searched Wen Xiao's body

76
00:05:57,470 --> 00:05:59,400
with the sea of the soul last night.

77
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:10,850
Now,

78
00:06:12,770 --> 00:06:14,770
she has been poisoned.

79
00:06:17,310 --> 00:06:18,120
Yes.

80
00:06:18,770 --> 00:06:21,720
So these days that I was gone, I went to find Tao Tie

81
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:23,890
to see if I can purify

82
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:25,580
the poison on the Baize Token.

83
00:06:32,159 --> 00:06:33,400
Wen Xiao

84
00:06:33,420 --> 00:06:34,490
is poisoned?

85
00:06:42,300 --> 00:06:44,630
The poison was applied on the instrument.

86
00:06:44,950 --> 00:06:46,480
It's colorless, odorless,

87
00:06:46,630 --> 00:06:47,930
and hard to detect.

88
00:06:48,550 --> 00:06:51,790
Every time you used the Baize Order to play the instrument,

89
00:06:51,790 --> 00:06:54,409
the poison entered your body unconsciously.

90
00:06:54,870 --> 00:06:56,130
The poison...

91
00:06:58,510 --> 00:07:00,710
should have entered the heart already.

92
00:07:04,030 --> 00:07:06,160
That's why you stole the dragon scale?

93
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:12,740
Did Li Lun do this secretly

94
00:07:13,430 --> 00:07:15,090
when he stole the Divine Wood?

95
00:07:16,870 --> 00:07:18,530
Can the poison be eliminated?

96
00:07:20,710 --> 00:07:21,640
It's hard.

97
00:07:24,820 --> 00:07:25,940
Lord Bai Yan,

98
00:07:27,190 --> 00:07:28,880
why did you keep it from me?

99
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:31,280
Why didn't you tell me the truth?

100
00:07:32,390 --> 00:07:35,120
She was afraid that we would use the dragon scale to save you,

101
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:37,520
instead of repairing the Cloud Light Sword

102
00:07:37,860 --> 00:07:38,780
to save Bai Jiu.

103
00:07:40,390 --> 00:07:41,030
Yes.

104
00:07:43,370 --> 00:07:46,570
I hope to repair the Cloud Light Sword as soon as possible.

105
00:07:46,980 --> 00:07:49,310
Lord Bai Yan, you're descended from a god,

106
00:07:49,409 --> 00:07:50,550
yet you're also so selfish.

107
00:07:50,550 --> 00:07:52,030
I can understand.

108
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:55,850
As a mother,

109
00:07:56,740 --> 00:08:00,010
she certainly doesn't want to see anything happen to her son.

110
00:08:00,010 --> 00:08:00,620
No.

111
00:08:01,990 --> 00:08:03,500
That is secondary.

112
00:08:04,410 --> 00:08:05,550
Then in your eyes,

113
00:08:06,470 --> 00:08:07,530
what is important?

114
00:08:10,140 --> 00:08:11,880
As the descendant of a god,

115
00:08:13,390 --> 00:08:15,000
between my son and the world,

116
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:18,860
I must choose the world.

117
00:08:20,670 --> 00:08:22,950
Since you understand this,

118
00:08:23,390 --> 00:08:25,150
why are you doing the opposite?

119
00:08:26,050 --> 00:08:27,550
If Wen Xiao dies,

120
00:08:27,990 --> 00:08:31,160
a new Baize Goddess will appear in the mortal world.

121
00:08:31,950 --> 00:08:32,940
The Baize Token

122
00:08:34,289 --> 00:08:36,150
will choose a new master.

123
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:40,320
But if Li Lun and Bai Jiu's primordial spirit combine,

124
00:08:41,309 --> 00:08:43,309
the two realms will be in turmoil.

125
00:08:43,669 --> 00:08:45,000
All beings will suffer.

126
00:08:45,990 --> 00:08:47,760
Many people were possessed by Li Lun before.

127
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:49,160
But Bai Jiu is different.

128
00:08:49,690 --> 00:08:50,790
The Divine Wood clan

129
00:08:50,790 --> 00:08:51,990
both has vitality

130
00:08:53,090 --> 00:08:54,750
and the aura of death.

131
00:08:54,910 --> 00:08:57,240
Besides being able to revive everything,

132
00:08:57,450 --> 00:08:59,580
we can also absorb the world's vitality,

133
00:08:59,580 --> 00:09:01,200
killing all beings

134
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:03,650
and even stifling the growth of grass.

135
00:09:04,410 --> 00:09:06,050
Without grains and fruits,

136
00:09:06,590 --> 00:09:08,110
without flora and dew,

137
00:09:09,970 --> 00:09:11,830
there will be widespread famine.

138
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:14,500
Are you telling the truth?

139
00:09:16,210 --> 00:09:17,630
Can we still trust you?

140
00:09:19,260 --> 00:09:20,840
If you don't believe me,

141
00:09:22,310 --> 00:09:24,550
you can ask the other old Mountain Gods.

142
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:26,770
You'll get your answer.

143
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:31,240
It’s fate.

144
00:09:32,110 --> 00:09:34,040
Every generation of Baize Goddess

145
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:36,330
died to save the world.

146
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:39,190
Maybe fate has destined

147
00:09:41,350 --> 00:09:42,180
that this

148
00:09:43,470 --> 00:09:45,120
is your end.

149
00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:53,710
So,

150
00:09:56,310 --> 00:09:57,710
it's not the Great Demon,

151
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:01,120
not Zhuo,

152
00:10:03,270 --> 00:10:04,720
nor Jiu.

153
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:10,400
It's me.

154
00:10:28,350 --> 00:10:29,150
My lord.

155
00:10:29,790 --> 00:10:31,100
I'm useless.

156
00:10:31,550 --> 00:10:33,210
I didn't get the dragon scale.

157
00:10:39,700 --> 00:10:40,940
Don't be sad.

158
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:45,120
It's Zhao Yuanzhou who was cunning.

159
00:10:49,460 --> 00:10:50,970
Are you afraid?

160
00:10:51,450 --> 00:10:52,530
No.

161
00:10:53,740 --> 00:10:55,860
I can die for you anytime.

162
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:05,730
My question is...

163
00:11:07,570 --> 00:11:09,660
Are you afraid of me dying?

164
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:14,510
Yes.

165
00:11:18,040 --> 00:11:19,900
If you die,

166
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:22,980
I will die too.

167
00:11:24,310 --> 00:11:26,280
I'll follow you no matter what.

168
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:46,070
When I was imprisoned before,

169
00:11:47,520 --> 00:11:49,520
I looked at the surrounding scenery

170
00:11:49,550 --> 00:11:51,960
day and night.

171
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:55,130
I grew sick of it

172
00:11:56,390 --> 00:11:58,810
and wanted to go out every day.

173
00:12:01,030 --> 00:12:03,610
Every time I possessed someone,

174
00:12:04,270 --> 00:12:06,920
I lost half of my lifespan,

175
00:12:09,420 --> 00:12:11,140
but I couldn't help it.

176
00:12:12,070 --> 00:12:12,870
Just like

177
00:12:12,870 --> 00:12:15,850
craving sweet poison,

178
00:12:16,210 --> 00:12:18,000
I kept possessing others.

179
00:12:19,030 --> 00:12:20,630
On them,

180
00:12:20,930 --> 00:12:23,060
I experienced a lot of

181
00:12:24,170 --> 00:12:25,790
the facets of humanity,

182
00:12:26,390 --> 00:12:27,740
the various emotions,

183
00:12:28,870 --> 00:12:30,550
and natural sceneries,

184
00:12:35,460 --> 00:12:36,910
with the mountains

185
00:12:38,630 --> 00:12:39,670
and the waters.

186
00:12:42,110 --> 00:12:43,500
But now,

187
00:12:47,590 --> 00:12:49,150
I still haven't found

188
00:12:49,150 --> 00:12:51,070
a place where I belong.

189
00:12:53,070 --> 00:12:55,470
Even a stray dog

190
00:12:56,740 --> 00:12:59,280
can find shelter from the rain.

191
00:13:02,940 --> 00:13:05,410
Travelers braving the wind and snow

192
00:13:06,940 --> 00:13:07,860
also yearn

193
00:13:10,890 --> 00:13:13,010
for a lamp kept illuminated for them.

194
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:15,600
But I...

195
00:13:19,890 --> 00:13:22,190
After everything,

196
00:13:22,590 --> 00:13:23,910
I have only here.

197
00:13:27,380 --> 00:13:29,210
I have only here.

198
00:13:33,030 --> 00:13:35,190
How pitiful.

199
00:13:45,160 --> 00:13:47,660
If I really will die,

200
00:13:49,720 --> 00:13:51,780
I have to find someone to die with.

201
00:13:57,080 --> 00:14:00,820
I have to find the grandest stage too.

202
00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:09,560
Let's go.

with the Baize Order's mission.

But it’s fate.

died to save the world.

Perhaps

fate was already predestined.

I believe

00:15:04,710 --> 00:15:06,230
you will make

217
00:15:06,610 --> 00:15:08,160
the right choice.

[Two Years Ago]

It's only been a few days

220
00:15:45,260 --> 00:15:46,660
and you got new injuries.

221
00:15:50,620 --> 00:15:52,020
It's just a minor injury.

222
00:15:52,270 --> 00:15:53,110
I'm fine.

223
00:15:54,430 --> 00:15:56,300
The Gou She snake is poisonous.

224
00:15:56,800 --> 00:15:58,800
Why did you provoke it for no reason?

225
00:15:59,970 --> 00:16:00,940
I heard

226
00:16:00,940 --> 00:16:03,130
it has clues about Baize Token.

227
00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:11,690
Are you stupid?

228
00:16:13,520 --> 00:16:14,800
How could a minor demon

229
00:16:15,370 --> 00:16:17,630
know the whereabouts of the Baize Token?

230
00:16:19,880 --> 00:16:22,810
Even if there's only a one-millionth chance of hope,

231
00:16:23,180 --> 00:16:24,520
I won't give up.

232
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,780
Your body is getting weaker.

233
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:31,570
I don't want anything to happen to you.

234
00:16:35,110 --> 00:16:36,830
I want you to live well.

235
00:16:43,180 --> 00:16:44,920
You must live well.

236
00:16:46,830 --> 00:16:48,220
I've imagined

237
00:16:48,740 --> 00:16:50,680
various endings.

238
00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:52,760
But I didn't expect

239
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:55,720
the ending was predestined.

240
00:16:55,910 --> 00:16:57,290
I don't want to die.

241
00:16:58,890 --> 00:17:00,660
I still have a lot

242
00:17:02,030 --> 00:17:03,090
I haven't done yet.

243
00:17:10,270 --> 00:17:11,530
Don't be discouraged.

244
00:17:12,790 --> 00:17:15,250
We can still detoxify with the dragon scale.

245
00:17:16,339 --> 00:17:18,270
But there is only one dragon scale.

246
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:23,990
As the Baize Goddess,

247
00:17:25,750 --> 00:17:27,670
I have to make the right choice.

248
00:17:31,030 --> 00:17:32,630
Even ants fight to live.

249
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:35,450
How is wanting to live

250
00:17:36,190 --> 00:17:38,110
not the right choice?

251
00:17:40,710 --> 00:17:41,830
You can

252
00:17:42,650 --> 00:17:44,540
ask yourself this question too.

253
00:17:47,290 --> 00:17:49,090
I don't want to scrape by to live,

254
00:17:50,180 --> 00:17:52,060
but I'm unable to die.

255
00:17:53,490 --> 00:17:55,090
Meanwhile, you cherish life

256
00:17:55,640 --> 00:17:57,130
so passionately

257
00:17:58,690 --> 00:18:00,350
yet must sacrifice yourself.

258
00:18:01,470 --> 00:18:03,400
The heavens are so unfair.

259
00:18:04,190 --> 00:18:06,240
So the fate of the goddess

260
00:18:06,570 --> 00:18:07,830
is not to save the world

261
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:11,090
but to be the price of saving the world.

262
00:18:15,730 --> 00:18:17,090
I'm afraid of death,

263
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:20,720
but even more, I can't

264
00:18:21,930 --> 00:18:23,090
let Bai Jiu die,

265
00:18:24,870 --> 00:18:26,520
or let all living beings

266
00:18:27,540 --> 00:18:28,890
die because of me.

267
00:18:30,710 --> 00:18:32,200
So the Baize Token

268
00:18:33,610 --> 00:18:36,620
always chooses the kindest and purest people.

269
00:18:38,300 --> 00:18:41,830
Only they would willingly sacrifice themselves for the world.

ask to meet me?

Wen Xiao,

310
00:21:17,910 --> 00:21:18,670
right?

311
00:21:19,130 --> 00:21:20,170
Yes.

312
00:21:25,240 --> 00:21:27,690
Bai Jiu put the poison on the Divine Wood.

313
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:29,810
Every time Wen Xiao played it,

314
00:21:30,230 --> 00:21:33,140
the poison slowly entered her body.

315
00:21:34,570 --> 00:21:36,500
The more she used her divine power,

316
00:21:36,840 --> 00:21:39,050
the faster the poison seeped in.

317
00:21:39,610 --> 00:21:42,680
I also applied poison on Bai Jiu's medicine pipe.

318
00:21:43,390 --> 00:21:44,410
So he

319
00:21:44,840 --> 00:21:46,010
was poisoned too.

320
00:21:48,890 --> 00:21:50,960
What's your purpose?

321
00:21:50,980 --> 00:21:51,930
I want

322
00:21:52,390 --> 00:21:54,890
Zhao Yuanzhou's inner core.

323
00:21:55,790 --> 00:21:59,360
Exchanging the inner core of an extremely evil demon who killed you father and brother

324
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:02,140
for a noble Baize Goddess's life...

325
00:22:02,600 --> 00:22:03,750
Why not?

326
00:22:09,650 --> 00:22:12,350
The Cloud Light Sword is an artifact of the Bingyi Clan.

327
00:22:12,350 --> 00:22:13,680
It's not ordinary iron.

328
00:22:13,690 --> 00:22:15,220
The fire of the mortal world

329
00:22:15,270 --> 00:22:16,270
can't forge it.

330
00:22:17,350 --> 00:22:19,280
So apart from the dragon scale,

331
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:23,650
we also need to use the Ever-Burning Wood in Zhao Yuanzhou's body

332
00:22:23,650 --> 00:22:25,390
to smelt it.

333
00:22:27,430 --> 00:22:28,230
Take it.

334
00:22:31,270 --> 00:22:32,270
Zhao Yuanzhou.

335
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:35,730
Once you use the power of the Ever-Burning Wood in your body,

336
00:22:35,730 --> 00:22:37,700
it will damage your inner core

337
00:22:37,730 --> 00:22:39,860
and greatly consume your demonic power.

338
00:22:39,860 --> 00:22:42,060
It'll be hard to recover in a short time.

339
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:46,660
Of course I know.

340
00:22:47,330 --> 00:22:49,590
So, before my demonic power is restored,

341
00:22:49,720 --> 00:22:51,310
I'll have to ask Mr. Zhuo

342
00:22:51,330 --> 00:22:53,050
to protect me well.

343
00:24:18,900 --> 00:24:20,040
Mr. Zhuo.

344
00:24:21,550 --> 00:24:22,530
From now on,

345
00:24:23,060 --> 00:24:25,430
we will protect the Wilderness

00:24:25,960 --> 00:24:27,530
and mortal world together.

347
00:24:30,300 --> 00:24:31,270
Promise me.

348
00:24:35,470 --> 00:24:37,400
Give me Zhao Yuanzhou's inner core

349
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:40,210
and I'll give you the antidote.

350
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:48,610
Zhao Yuanzhou!

351
00:25:08,600 --> 00:25:10,060
Didn't you say

352
00:25:11,640 --> 00:25:14,640
you're a great demon of tens of thousands of years old?

353
00:25:17,870 --> 00:25:19,430
An all-powerful

354
00:25:22,510 --> 00:25:24,790
and undying great demon?

355
00:25:28,200 --> 00:25:30,330
You promised not to act tough anymore.

356
00:26:21,510 --> 00:26:22,750
Mr. Zhuo,

357
00:26:23,540 --> 00:26:24,560
waiting for me?

358
00:26:27,930 --> 00:26:30,060
Why did you only pour yourself a drink?

359
00:26:31,240 --> 00:26:34,100
I've never heard of invalids who want to drink wine.

360
00:26:35,560 --> 00:26:37,420
The Ever-Burning Wood's torture

361
00:26:39,480 --> 00:26:41,810
makes the malicious energy in me flare up.

362
00:26:41,810 --> 00:26:43,470
I wanted to drink some Jade Ointment

363
00:26:43,470 --> 00:26:44,740
to relieve myself.

364
00:26:46,210 --> 00:26:48,220
I won't drink if you say so.

365
00:26:48,950 --> 00:26:50,010
I'll listen to you.

366
00:27:24,070 --> 00:27:26,000
We've known each other for so long.

367
00:27:26,200 --> 00:27:27,550
I can't believe I've never had a chance

368
00:27:27,550 --> 00:27:29,020
to drink with you.

369
00:27:31,130 --> 00:27:32,800
You almost had the chance.

370
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:34,310
When?

371
00:27:36,600 --> 00:27:38,580
When your malicious energy went out of control

372
00:27:38,580 --> 00:27:41,310
and you locked yourself in your peach blossom yard.

373
00:27:41,310 --> 00:27:42,590
I went to kill you.

374
00:27:43,010 --> 00:27:44,130
Before leaving,

375
00:27:44,160 --> 00:27:47,360
Ying Lei gave me two jars of pomegranate wine to see me off.

376
00:27:48,280 --> 00:27:50,200
Before taking action,

377
00:27:52,010 --> 00:27:54,240
I hoped to have a last drink

378
00:27:55,490 --> 00:27:57,280
and meal with you.

379
00:28:04,520 --> 00:28:06,010
I'd rather not have

380
00:28:06,460 --> 00:28:07,590
that kind of chance.

381
00:28:09,010 --> 00:28:10,160
This cup

382
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:13,320
is a toast to how we have a blood feud

383
00:28:13,740 --> 00:28:15,630
but can still drink together.

384
00:28:16,650 --> 00:28:17,460
In the past,

385
00:28:18,920 --> 00:28:20,800
we did have a blood feud.

386
00:28:21,350 --> 00:28:22,430
In the past?

387
00:28:23,180 --> 00:28:23,990
Yes.

388
00:28:24,790 --> 00:28:25,600
In the past.

389
00:28:30,790 --> 00:28:32,290
In the past,

390
00:28:32,460 --> 00:28:34,370
I indeed hated you so much.

391
00:28:36,590 --> 00:28:38,490
So even if I knew

392
00:28:38,580 --> 00:28:40,910
you were controlled by malicious energy,

393
00:28:41,280 --> 00:28:43,090
I still couldn't forgive you.

394
00:28:45,860 --> 00:28:46,660
Later,

395
00:28:48,760 --> 00:28:49,980
I became a demon.

396
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:53,400
I finally understand

397
00:28:54,580 --> 00:28:55,680
what it means

398
00:28:57,170 --> 00:28:58,410
by having no choice.

399
00:29:12,550 --> 00:29:14,040
Between us, there is

400
00:29:17,040 --> 00:29:18,570
both enmity and gratitude.

401
00:29:22,870 --> 00:29:24,310
To you, I harbor

402
00:29:26,610 --> 00:29:27,870
both hate and loyalty.

403
00:29:37,280 --> 00:29:38,810
These hundreds of emotions

404
00:29:43,090 --> 00:29:44,420
are ineffable.

405
00:29:49,280 --> 00:29:50,080
However,

406
00:29:53,030 --> 00:29:55,700
since I chose to be your closest friend,

407
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:01,130
there's no need

408
00:30:03,140 --> 00:30:04,970
to talk about this anymore.

409
00:30:09,170 --> 00:30:10,500
Having a soulmate

410
00:30:11,910 --> 00:30:13,350
makes this life worth it.

411
00:30:15,990 --> 00:30:17,700
I hope that in the future,

412
00:30:18,330 --> 00:30:19,790
in this vast world,

413
00:30:22,700 --> 00:30:24,030
our group

414
00:30:25,470 --> 00:30:27,410
will walk side by side forever.

415
00:30:47,900 --> 00:30:48,970
The first toast

416
00:30:50,890 --> 00:30:53,490
is to thank you for treating me with sincerity.

417
00:30:53,640 --> 00:30:55,550
You helped me find the dragon bone

418
00:30:55,630 --> 00:30:57,100
and become a demon,

419
00:30:57,140 --> 00:30:58,440
saving me.

420
00:31:28,280 --> 00:31:31,200
♫The trees and grass of the world sway with the wind♫

421

♫Beneath the bodhi tree, dust gathers♫

422
00:31:32,990 --> 00:31:34,100
The second toast

423
00:31:35,790 --> 00:31:36,640
is to thank you

424
00:31:36,460 --> 00:31:39,590
♫Who truly decides fate's design?♫

425

427

♫Vividly painted in black and white♫

428

429

♫It's water under the bridge♫

439

♫The heavens endure, the world remains eternal♫

441

It's Wen Xiao's.

453
00:33:03,190 --> 00:33:04,330
I'm sorry.

454
00:33:05,280 --> 00:33:06,460
In order to save her,

455
00:33:08,250 --> 00:33:09,230
I still

456
00:33:10,110 --> 00:33:11,820
must stab you.

457
00:33:14,820 --> 00:33:16,740
Is this the only way?

458
00:33:38,790 --> 00:33:39,830
Zhao Yuanzhou!

♫The spring breeze asks him♫

466
00:34:20,250 --> 00:34:21,760

♫What troubles turned his hair white♫

468
00:34:22,130 --> 00:34:23,540
Don't worry.

469
00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:25,040
I'm fine.

470
00:34:27,139 --> 00:34:28,940
It's not the time to be stubborn.

471
00:34:30,580 --> 00:34:31,980
He's not being stubborn.

472
00:34:35,889 --> 00:34:37,159
Indeed,

473
00:34:38,310 --> 00:34:40,060
it was very dangerous just now.

474
00:34:41,400 --> 00:34:42,489
But luckily,

475
00:34:45,610 --> 00:34:47,320
Mr. Zhuo succeeded.

476
00:34:54,670 --> 00:34:55,940
What is this?

477
00:34:58,370 --> 00:34:59,530
Ever-Burning Wood.

478
00:35:05,700 --> 00:35:07,220
The Bingyi Sword Technique

479
00:35:07,220 --> 00:35:08,560
can guide and lead.

480
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:11,750
Since it can remove the primordial spirit,

481
00:35:11,750 --> 00:35:13,630
maybe it can also remove the Ever-Burning Wood

482
00:35:13,630 --> 00:35:14,570
in my inner core.

483
00:35:15,530 --> 00:35:17,750
So we tried it together.

484
00:35:18,720 --> 00:35:20,920
Is this something you can try casually?

485
00:35:22,200 --> 00:35:23,680
Without being sure,

486
00:35:24,640 --> 00:35:26,590
you're risking your life.

487
00:35:29,210 --> 00:35:31,440
I was actually 50% sure.

488
00:35:37,050 --> 00:35:37,980
Thirty percent.

489
00:35:43,390 --> 00:35:44,790
Both of you are crazy.

490
00:35:45,800 --> 00:35:47,360
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

491
00:35:47,630 --> 00:35:48,490
What about you?

492
00:35:50,070 --> 00:35:50,860
I'm sorry.

493
00:35:56,030 --> 00:35:57,270
Don't be angry.

494
00:35:57,810 --> 00:35:59,270
As long as I could save you,

495
00:36:00,430 --> 00:36:02,180
I would've tried even if it was

496
00:36:02,550 --> 00:36:03,720
only 10% possible.

497
00:36:06,680 --> 00:36:07,710
Besides,

498
00:36:09,250 --> 00:36:11,180
if he really stabbed me to death,

499
00:36:11,690 --> 00:36:13,660
you'd get even with him.

500
00:36:14,840 --> 00:36:16,440
I wouldn't be shortchanged.

501
00:36:27,440 --> 00:36:29,400
Wen Zongyu wants my inner core

502
00:36:30,070 --> 00:36:32,400
only for the Ever-Burning Wood inside it.

503
00:36:32,760 --> 00:36:34,820
If we give him the Ever-Burning Wood,

504
00:36:35,030 --> 00:36:37,090
we should be able to get the antidote.

505
00:37:08,630 --> 00:37:09,960
The Ever-Burning Wood.

506
00:37:11,990 --> 00:37:12,790
Antidote.

507
00:37:18,910 --> 00:37:20,770
Put the Ever-Burning Wood there.

508
00:37:21,320 --> 00:37:22,850
I'll toss you the antidote.

509
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:36,560
Retreat.

510
00:37:38,230 --> 00:37:39,080
More!

511
00:38:30,830 --> 00:38:31,950
Sir!

512
00:38:54,150 --> 00:38:55,410
Ever-Burning Wood...

513
00:38:58,620 --> 00:39:00,080
The Ever-Burning Wood...

514
00:39:00,180 --> 00:39:01,520
I will

515
00:39:01,850 --> 00:39:02,690
finally get

516
00:39:02,720 --> 00:39:04,050
the Ever-Burning Wood.

517
00:39:08,110 --> 00:39:09,970
Mortals can't touch it directly!

518
00:39:53,640 --> 00:39:54,880
I didn't expect

519
00:39:56,050 --> 00:39:58,380
his obsession with the Ever-Burning Wood

520
00:39:58,710 --> 00:40:01,560
reached such a crazed extent.

521
00:40:16,850 --> 00:40:18,110
Where is the antidote?

522
00:40:20,360 --> 00:40:21,560
Give me the antidote.

523
00:40:24,840 --> 00:40:26,400
There is no antidote at all.

524
00:40:29,910 --> 00:40:31,330
The poison in Li Lun

525
00:40:32,570 --> 00:40:34,270
is incurable.

526
00:40:34,730 --> 00:40:37,660
Unless someone is willing to use their demonic power

527
00:40:37,850 --> 00:40:40,110
to absorb the poison into their own body.

528
00:41:15,640 --> 00:41:16,740
Jiu.

529
00:41:17,270 --> 00:41:18,060
Jiu!

530
00:41:22,790 --> 00:41:23,850
Ms. Pei!

531
00:41:25,710 --> 00:41:26,710
He is not Jiu.

532
00:41:29,680 --> 00:41:31,210
What are you doing here?

533
00:41:32,840 --> 00:41:34,500
Leaves return to their roots.

534
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:36,730
Humans and demons are the same.

535
00:41:39,810 --> 00:41:40,640
My lord.

536
00:41:55,600 --> 00:41:57,070
For this last moment,

537
00:41:57,530 --> 00:42:00,590
I'll let you see what I really look like

538
00:42:01,610 --> 00:42:02,700
to see me off.

539
00:42:03,650 --> 00:42:04,450
No.

540
00:42:11,440 --> 00:42:12,800
What are you doing?

541
00:42:13,120 --> 00:42:14,560
Detoxifying you.

542
00:42:17,200 --> 00:42:18,360
I didn't expect her

543
00:42:18,990 --> 00:42:20,800
to be so loyal to Li Lun.

544
00:42:21,170 --> 00:42:21,770
No.

545
00:42:23,470 --> 00:42:24,800
It's not loyalty.

546
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:27,790
The way she looks at Li Lun

547
00:42:28,610 --> 00:42:30,810
is not the way one looks at one's master.

548
00:42:33,850 --> 00:42:35,410
Stop!

549
00:42:36,200 --> 00:42:38,120
I don't need you to do this for me.

550
00:43:05,230 --> 00:43:06,160
Great.

551
00:43:08,720 --> 00:43:11,270
I finally saved you.

552
00:43:16,170 --> 00:43:19,040
If you hadn't saved me from the cage back then,

553
00:43:19,470 --> 00:43:21,240
I would have died long ago.

554
00:43:25,960 --> 00:43:27,130
Now,

555
00:43:29,730 --> 00:43:32,330
take it as me repaying you.

556
00:43:34,970 --> 00:43:37,040
You never owed me.

557
00:43:39,690 --> 00:43:41,570
Then take it as you owing me.

558
00:43:46,190 --> 00:43:47,990
Promise me one thing.

559
00:43:48,730 --> 00:43:49,670
Go ahead.

560
00:43:52,660 --> 00:43:54,230
I've endlessly

561
00:43:55,830 --> 00:43:58,130
transformed into other people.

562
00:44:01,170 --> 00:44:03,530
I hope you can remember

563
00:44:07,260 --> 00:44:08,660
the real me.

564
00:44:19,590 --> 00:44:20,780
Come with me.

565
00:44:22,770 --> 00:44:24,570
I'll take you to the Wilderness.

566
00:44:28,150 --> 00:44:29,830
Are you afraid?

567
00:44:30,270 --> 00:44:31,380
No.

568
00:44:32,590 --> 00:44:34,700
I can die for you anytime.

569
00:44:35,050 --> 00:44:36,760
If you die,

570
00:44:37,490 --> 00:44:38,820
I will die too.

571
00:44:40,420 --> 00:44:42,430
I'll follow you in life and death.

572
00:44:47,140 --> 00:44:51,980
♫The wind brushes against rivers and hills♫

573
00:44:52,030 --> 00:44:55,850
♫Wild blooms refuse to fall♫

574
00:44:55,910 --> 00:45:01,020
♫They've seen every hue the world has borne♫

575
00:45:01,120 --> 00:45:05,100
♫Which blossom is meant for me?♫

576
00:45:05,560 --> 00:45:10,110
♫As songs are sung, how many truly understand?♫

577
00:45:10,200 --> 00:45:13,990
♫The varied regrets we sing repeatedly♫

578
00:45:14,360 --> 00:45:17,150
♫Have echoed for years♫

579
00:45:17,430 --> 00:45:22,130
♫Hoping fate will amend♫

580
00:45:22,570 --> 00:45:26,510
♫Remember me, a humble♫
