[Episode 6]

3
00:01:49,229 --> 00:01:50,229
Zhu Yan.

4
00:01:50,870 --> 00:01:53,630
I still like to talk to you face to face.

5
00:02:01,070 --> 00:02:02,750
Zhao Yuanzhou.

6
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:06,790
Our game

7
00:02:08,020 --> 00:02:10,350
has just begun.

8
00:02:19,530 --> 00:02:21,090
It really was you.

9
00:02:55,320 --> 00:02:56,520
Are you okay?

10
00:02:58,190 --> 00:02:59,340
What are you doing?

11
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:03,240
I did it to save you two.

12
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:04,540
Did I ask you to save me?

13
00:03:07,640 --> 00:03:09,360
I won't die anyway.

14
00:03:10,030 --> 00:03:12,160
Taking a few hits for you is no big deal.

15
00:03:18,079 --> 00:03:19,360
Who is he?

16
00:03:20,710 --> 00:03:22,760
A scumbag who has to

17
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:24,610
stay hidden.

18
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:34,530
What happened to Ran Yi?

19
00:03:35,370 --> 00:03:37,310
Ran Yi was controlled by Li Lun.

20
00:03:37,890 --> 00:03:39,579
Weak demons

21
00:03:40,150 --> 00:03:42,550
are easily controlled by powerful demons.

22
00:03:44,460 --> 00:03:45,270
Zhu Yan,

23
00:03:47,030 --> 00:03:50,579
you're making worse and worse friends.

24
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:55,640
At least, you used to hang out with the Baize Goddess.

25
00:03:57,620 --> 00:03:58,590
Now,

26
00:03:58,590 --> 00:04:00,540
even these cheap things

27
00:04:00,540 --> 00:04:02,350
can order you around.

28
00:04:06,230 --> 00:04:07,730
You didn't know, right?

29
00:04:09,210 --> 00:04:12,330
He and Zhao Wan'er were as close as brother and sister.

30
00:04:13,730 --> 00:04:16,110
Zhao Wan'er even gave him

31
00:04:16,130 --> 00:04:19,070
the name of her late brother, Zhao Yuanzhou.

32
00:04:20,709 --> 00:04:21,779
Zhu Yan.

33
00:04:23,470 --> 00:04:25,140
Am I right?

34
00:04:26,630 --> 00:04:29,240
One was the noble Baize Goddess.

35
00:04:29,670 --> 00:04:32,690
One was the evil great demon, Zhu Yan.

36
00:04:34,870 --> 00:04:36,600
Because he didn't want others to know

37
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:38,430
they were close,

38
00:04:40,220 --> 00:04:41,670
every time

39
00:04:41,670 --> 00:04:44,390
he was with Zhao Wan'er,

40
00:04:45,990 --> 00:04:47,790
he would wear a mask.

41
00:04:52,510 --> 00:04:53,630
It really is you.

42
00:05:24,740 --> 00:05:26,020
Zhuo Yichen,

43
00:05:27,330 --> 00:05:29,520
don't you want to

44
00:05:30,190 --> 00:05:32,020
avenge your blood feud?

45
00:05:33,460 --> 00:05:35,680
Although he had no choice,

46
00:05:36,710 --> 00:05:40,110
he did kill your father and brother.

47
00:05:41,470 --> 00:05:43,690
If your dead father and brother

48
00:05:43,750 --> 00:05:47,060
saw you fighting alongside the enemy,

49
00:05:47,610 --> 00:05:49,420
how could they

50
00:05:51,180 --> 00:05:52,810
rest in peace?

51
00:05:56,680 --> 00:05:58,030
I can't kill him.

52
00:06:00,470 --> 00:06:01,830
You can.

53
00:06:04,050 --> 00:06:06,330
With my help,

54
00:06:07,570 --> 00:06:09,200
you can.

55
00:06:14,670 --> 00:06:15,560
Okay.

56
00:06:35,409 --> 00:06:38,720
Humans always love to lie.

57
00:06:38,830 --> 00:06:41,220
I will kill Zhao Yuanzhou.

58
00:06:42,250 --> 00:06:46,210
But first, I need to kill you, an even more evil thing.

59
00:06:47,350 --> 00:06:49,210
If you kill me,

60
00:06:50,770 --> 00:06:53,720
no one will know where the Baize Token is.

61
00:06:53,750 --> 00:06:56,210
You know the whereabouts of the Baize Token?

62
00:06:57,470 --> 00:06:59,790
On the night Zhao Wan'er died,

63
00:07:00,530 --> 00:07:02,080
I was sealed,

64
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:05,800
but I was the only conscious person at the scene.

65
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,600
Naturally, I saw where the Baize Token went.

66
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:10,840
Where is it?

67
00:07:14,110 --> 00:07:16,030
It's on you.

68
00:07:20,590 --> 00:07:23,160
You saw it in your dream just now.

69
00:07:23,990 --> 00:07:25,160
Right?

70
00:07:32,900 --> 00:07:36,110
But now, you only have half of Baize Token,

71
00:07:37,159 --> 00:07:39,370
so you canâ€™t use it.

72
00:07:39,710 --> 00:07:41,040
Where is the other half?

73
00:07:41,880 --> 00:07:43,270
Do you want to know?

74
00:07:48,150 --> 00:07:49,980
But I don't want to tell you.

75
00:07:51,150 --> 00:07:53,380
You have to say it anyway.

76
00:08:22,570 --> 00:08:25,170
Ran Yi's dream control magic is useless on him.

77
00:08:32,380 --> 00:08:33,720
Really?

78
00:08:46,150 --> 00:08:48,550
He has been running away for so long.

79
00:08:50,010 --> 00:08:50,710
Today,

80
00:08:50,710 --> 00:08:53,540
let him sink into it.

81
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:18,440
Zhuo!

82
00:10:06,610 --> 00:10:07,410
Chen.

83
00:10:10,210 --> 00:10:12,110
Today is the Double Third Festival.

84
00:10:12,110 --> 00:10:13,910
Why are you still practicing?

85
00:10:14,150 --> 00:10:16,370
I want to practice my swordsmanship

86
00:10:16,510 --> 00:10:19,150
and help Father and Brother in the future.

87
00:10:20,140 --> 00:10:21,610
The Double Third Festival

88
00:10:22,570 --> 00:10:24,010
is not that fun.

89
00:10:26,310 --> 00:10:28,600
I still remember when you were seven,

90
00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:30,640
you came crying

91
00:10:30,750 --> 00:10:31,950
to complain to me

92
00:10:32,790 --> 00:10:34,050
that the others

93
00:10:34,110 --> 00:10:35,970
weren't willing to play with you.

94
00:10:36,550 --> 00:10:38,150
Because your father

95
00:10:38,350 --> 00:10:39,240
and brother

96
00:10:39,640 --> 00:10:41,500
were anomalies who hunted demons

97
00:10:42,270 --> 00:10:44,220
and dealt with demons all the time.

98
00:10:44,790 --> 00:10:46,060
One day,

99
00:10:46,090 --> 00:10:47,890
they would turn into demons too.

100
00:10:50,390 --> 00:10:51,180
Brother,

101
00:10:51,980 --> 00:10:54,310
you still remember the nonsense I said

102
00:10:54,950 --> 00:10:56,190
when I was a kid?

103
00:10:57,380 --> 00:10:59,260
But after so many years,

104
00:11:01,270 --> 00:11:03,400
you indeed haven't made many friends.

105
00:11:04,680 --> 00:11:06,420
You're always alone.

106
00:11:10,740 --> 00:11:11,550
Brother.

107
00:11:14,750 --> 00:11:15,910
Did I

108
00:11:19,020 --> 00:11:21,620
turn myself into an anomaly?

109
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:25,320
So-called anomalies

110
00:11:26,390 --> 00:11:28,510
are just what narrow-minded people say

111
00:11:28,510 --> 00:11:30,250
in order to team up together

112
00:11:30,510 --> 00:11:33,110
and bring others down.

113
00:11:33,870 --> 00:11:34,860
They use this

114
00:11:35,070 --> 00:11:36,990
to show their righteousness

115
00:11:37,390 --> 00:11:39,650
and hide their own inferiority complex.

116
00:11:40,550 --> 00:11:41,110
Chen,

117
00:11:42,300 --> 00:11:43,780
we were born with

118
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:45,530
different responsibilities,

119
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,920
so we are destined to bear

120
00:11:47,990 --> 00:11:50,320
the pain that ordinary people don't have.

121
00:11:52,230 --> 00:11:52,760
Brother.

122
00:11:55,510 --> 00:11:57,230
Did you live like this too?

123
00:12:05,150 --> 00:12:06,310
Do you get lonely?

124
00:12:09,140 --> 00:12:10,600
Maybe one day,

125
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:13,430
you will meet someone

126
00:12:13,430 --> 00:12:15,550
you see as an anomaly.

127
00:12:17,150 --> 00:12:20,010
At that time, you'll need to make your own judgment.

128
00:12:20,630 --> 00:12:22,430
Your eyes lie.

129
00:12:23,590 --> 00:12:24,660
But your heart

130
00:12:24,870 --> 00:12:26,270
will tell you the answer.

131
00:12:30,390 --> 00:12:31,630
I believe you

132
00:12:32,230 --> 00:12:35,110
will surely meet like-minded companions.

133
00:12:36,230 --> 00:12:37,070
By then,

134
00:12:37,550 --> 00:12:39,150
you won't be lonely anymore.

135
00:12:43,950 --> 00:12:44,950
Will that happen?

136
00:12:46,750 --> 00:12:47,840
Of course.

137
00:12:50,390 --> 00:12:51,200
Remember,

138
00:12:52,950 --> 00:12:54,280
one wing is hard to keep.

139
00:12:55,340 --> 00:12:56,970
With two wings, you can soar.

140
00:13:41,850 --> 00:13:42,640
Zhuo!

141
00:14:19,940 --> 00:14:20,850
Zhuo!

142
00:14:22,470 --> 00:14:24,450
Zhuo!

143
00:15:22,070 --> 00:15:23,110
Wen Xiao!

144
00:15:56,960 --> 00:15:57,750
Zhuo Yichen!

145
00:15:58,200 --> 00:15:59,160
Wake up!

146
00:16:00,630 --> 00:16:03,030
The Cloud Light Sword can kill demons and destroy evil

147
00:16:03,030 --> 00:16:04,260
without being tainted by demons.

148
00:16:04,260 --> 00:16:05,750
It can break through

149
00:16:05,750 --> 00:16:07,450
all demonic hallucinations.

150
00:16:30,230 --> 00:16:31,450
He can't be woken up.

151
00:16:33,190 --> 00:16:34,790
Because he has never

152
00:16:34,820 --> 00:16:37,400
truly faced his nightmare.

153
00:16:38,060 --> 00:16:39,820
All these years,

154
00:16:40,390 --> 00:16:43,180
he has never had a dream.

155
00:16:44,840 --> 00:16:49,260
So he can't tell if it's a dream or not.

156
00:16:52,080 --> 00:16:54,550
He won't wake up.

157
00:16:56,910 --> 00:16:58,000
Zhuo!

158
00:18:19,030 --> 00:18:20,510
Zhuo Yichen.

159
00:18:22,570 --> 00:18:24,980
If I'm your nightmare,

160
00:18:29,100 --> 00:18:31,740
then pierce me.

161
00:19:07,950 --> 00:19:09,430
My nightmare

162
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:12,430
isn't you.

163
00:19:20,430 --> 00:19:22,230
It's myself.

164
00:19:28,390 --> 00:19:30,540
I'm afraid of dreaming

165
00:19:31,720 --> 00:19:32,980
and don't have dreams,

166
00:19:35,950 --> 00:19:37,880
so after my brother died,

167
00:19:38,670 --> 00:19:40,710
I never saw him in my dreams again.

168
00:19:44,780 --> 00:19:46,410
What I must overcome

169
00:19:48,430 --> 00:19:50,830
is myself, who has always been running away

170
00:19:52,470 --> 00:19:54,640
and has always been cowardly.

171
00:20:07,150 --> 00:20:08,720
My nightmare

172
00:20:09,230 --> 00:20:10,460
is myself!

173
00:20:09,980 --> 00:20:16,000
â™«Someday I'll return to my old hometownâ™«

174
00:20:16,840 --> 00:20:22,880
â™«Wearing old clothes but with eyes shining brightâ™«

175
00:20:23,850 --> 00:20:25,840
â™«Holding brilliance in the right handâ™«

183
00:21:01,300 --> 00:21:03,190
There's no way out of this vast sea

184
00:21:03,210 --> 00:21:05,110
but is in the mortal world.

185
00:21:05,260 --> 00:21:08,150
The galaxy is slim and we hold hands.

186
00:21:08,740 --> 00:21:10,860
Travel together in the world.

187
00:21:10,950 --> 00:21:12,060
Break!

188
00:21:20,550 --> 00:21:22,130
You're useless.

Ran Yi.

191
00:21:45,310 --> 00:21:46,230
Ran Yi!

192
00:21:51,540 --> 00:21:52,590
Ran Yi.

193
00:21:55,700 --> 00:21:57,600
Miss Qi.

194
00:21:58,650 --> 00:21:59,710
Ran Yi.

195
00:22:02,870 --> 00:22:03,590
No.

196
00:22:08,060 --> 00:22:09,170
Ran Yi.

197
00:22:35,390 --> 00:22:37,530
She has been parasitized for too long.

198
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:39,880
Her internal organs

199
00:22:40,520 --> 00:22:43,450
have been corroded by the malicious energy of Li Lun.

200
00:23:29,110 --> 00:23:30,150
Ran Yi.

201
00:23:33,110 --> 00:23:34,670
Do you remember

202
00:23:36,030 --> 00:23:39,410
the first time we met?

203
00:23:40,180 --> 00:23:41,310
Master,

204
00:23:41,430 --> 00:23:44,560
someone took down the notice of your search for famous doctors

205
00:23:44,560 --> 00:23:46,370
and said he can cure the lady's illness.

206
00:23:46,370 --> 00:23:47,210
But he...

207
00:23:47,480 --> 00:23:48,990
He's a little strange.

208
00:24:12,740 --> 00:24:14,740
When we first met,

209
00:24:15,630 --> 00:24:16,920
you covered your face

210
00:24:17,030 --> 00:24:18,780
with fabric

211
00:24:19,500 --> 00:24:21,630
and only revealed your eyes.

212
00:24:24,140 --> 00:24:26,690
But I will always remember

213
00:24:27,020 --> 00:24:28,620
those eyes.

214
00:24:29,930 --> 00:24:31,580
They were like

215
00:24:31,630 --> 00:24:34,490
a lake under the moonlit night sky.

216
00:24:34,950 --> 00:24:36,060
So beautiful.

217
00:24:40,510 --> 00:24:41,160
No.

218
00:24:44,570 --> 00:24:46,200
That wasn't the first time.

219
00:24:58,950 --> 00:24:59,750
My Lady,

220
00:24:59,880 --> 00:25:01,960
why do you always come to the lake?

221
00:25:04,380 --> 00:25:05,780
The books say,

222
00:25:06,710 --> 00:25:08,390
"All rivers return to the sea

223
00:25:08,740 --> 00:25:10,740
and all water returns to the abyss."

224
00:25:12,710 --> 00:25:14,630
But look at this lake.

225
00:25:15,590 --> 00:25:17,790
It's always trapped deep in the forest.

226
00:25:18,460 --> 00:25:20,910
Do you think it can return to the sea?

227
00:25:25,100 --> 00:25:26,360
Who's there?

228
00:25:30,860 --> 00:25:33,460
I was being chased by a demon hunter at the time.

229
00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:35,390
I was severely injured

230
00:25:35,980 --> 00:25:37,840
and was drifting along the water.

231
00:25:39,020 --> 00:25:40,480
In a daze,

232
00:25:41,470 --> 00:25:42,820
I saw you.

233
00:25:57,830 --> 00:25:59,960
I mustered all my strength

234
00:26:00,630 --> 00:26:01,720
to open my eyes

235
00:26:01,750 --> 00:26:03,150
and see you.

236
00:26:04,230 --> 00:26:07,440
You were like the legendary goddess of the Wilderness.

237
00:26:07,860 --> 00:26:09,510
Your eyes were gentle

238
00:26:09,750 --> 00:26:11,090
and compassionate.

239
00:26:11,920 --> 00:26:12,910
Go on.

240
00:26:14,990 --> 00:26:15,920
Go on.

241
00:26:19,730 --> 00:26:20,470
At that time,

242
00:26:20,470 --> 00:26:21,670
I told myself

243
00:26:23,160 --> 00:26:25,070
I must see you again.

244
00:26:27,070 --> 00:26:29,160
You've swum to many places.

245
00:26:29,870 --> 00:26:32,530
You must have seen a lot of beautiful sceneries.

246
00:26:36,520 --> 00:26:38,280
You're so silly.

247
00:26:39,620 --> 00:26:41,680
You've recovered,

248
00:26:43,610 --> 00:26:45,650
but you still refuse to leave.

249
00:26:47,430 --> 00:26:48,550
You can swim

250
00:26:48,570 --> 00:26:50,460
freely in the world,

251
00:26:51,030 --> 00:26:52,630
but you insist on

252
00:26:53,930 --> 00:26:56,160
being trapped in this cage with me.

253
00:27:19,590 --> 00:27:21,580
The sea is vast.

254
00:27:22,230 --> 00:27:24,020
There's no way out,

255
00:27:25,470 --> 00:27:27,230
but it is in the mortal world.

256
00:27:30,600 --> 00:27:33,360
I remember everything you said,

257
00:27:35,090 --> 00:27:37,590
the scenery you wanted to see,

258
00:27:38,160 --> 00:27:40,880
and all kinds of life you wanted to experience.

259
00:27:41,910 --> 00:27:44,210
So from then on,

260
00:27:45,610 --> 00:27:46,510
every night,

261
00:27:46,510 --> 00:27:48,710
I created a dream for you,

262
00:27:49,420 --> 00:27:51,820
so that the wishes you couldn't fulfill

263
00:27:51,910 --> 00:27:53,640
when trapped behind high walls

264
00:27:54,270 --> 00:27:55,630
could come true.

265
00:28:10,120 --> 00:28:12,650
I was willing to be with you forever like this,

266
00:28:13,270 --> 00:28:15,320
even if I had to abandon my freedom

267
00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:18,570
and just be a fish in your fish tank.

268
00:28:21,030 --> 00:28:22,470
But dream control magic

269
00:28:23,110 --> 00:28:24,570
is demonic, after all.

270
00:28:25,790 --> 00:28:28,320
The longer a person stays in a dream,

271
00:28:28,470 --> 00:28:30,030
the weaker one becomes.

272
00:28:30,070 --> 00:28:32,230
I couldn't create dreams for you anymore.

273
00:28:32,230 --> 00:28:33,420
Master.

274
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:35,620
The lady is still not getting better.

275
00:28:35,870 --> 00:28:37,000
These past few days,

276
00:28:37,020 --> 00:28:38,520
she's become bedridden.

277
00:28:40,760 --> 00:28:42,990
That's why I became a doctor

278
00:28:43,390 --> 00:28:44,680
to accompany you.

279
00:28:46,950 --> 00:28:48,270
I drew,

280
00:28:49,830 --> 00:28:50,750

[Classic of Mountains and Seas]

282
00:28:51,950 --> 00:28:53,300
read travel books,

283
00:28:54,740 --> 00:28:57,200
and talked about the world outside with you.

284
00:28:58,030 --> 00:28:59,670
My favorite phrase

285
00:29:01,750 --> 00:29:03,350
is "dreams come true."

286
00:29:06,650 --> 00:29:08,220
When I say it,

287
00:29:10,550 --> 00:29:12,110
I feel so happy.

288
00:29:15,480 --> 00:29:17,280
Whether you are a human

289
00:29:17,300 --> 00:29:18,710
or a demon,

290
00:29:21,160 --> 00:29:23,080
you are both my path

291
00:29:24,210 --> 00:29:25,490
and destination.

292
00:29:29,960 --> 00:29:31,320
Meeting you

293
00:29:32,090 --> 00:29:34,520
is the happiest thing in my life.

294
00:29:36,440 --> 00:29:38,040
I've never regretted it.

295
00:29:40,430 --> 00:29:41,350
Thank you

296
00:29:43,140 --> 00:29:44,960
for giving me the best dream.

297
00:29:48,390 --> 00:29:49,610
But those dreams

298
00:29:50,300 --> 00:29:51,580
hurt you.

299
00:29:54,320 --> 00:29:56,320
I'm not talking about those dreams.

300
00:30:00,290 --> 00:30:01,890
I mean now.

301
00:30:03,660 --> 00:30:05,030
This moment.

302
00:31:03,960 --> 00:31:05,540
Ran Yi committed suicide.

303
00:31:11,990 --> 00:31:13,700
He destroyed his inner core.

304
00:31:22,320 --> 00:31:24,070
You once said

305
00:31:24,890 --> 00:31:26,890
you would take me to the Wilderness,

306
00:31:27,180 --> 00:31:28,900
to your hometown.

307
00:31:29,960 --> 00:31:30,770
Yes.

308
00:31:31,480 --> 00:31:33,650
I'll show you the trees of heaven

309
00:31:33,790 --> 00:31:35,240

â™«Traces of lightâ™«

328

00:33:06,340 --> 00:33:09,460
â™«I only dare to look at you in dreamsâ™«

334
00:33:07,660 --> 00:33:09,820
not to be sad about the past.

â™«Yet I don't utter a wordâ™«

â™«Reflects youâ™«

347
00:33:36,730 --> 00:33:39,490
â™«Find youâ™«

348
00:33:37,510 --> 00:33:38,250
Leave.

349
00:33:38,590 --> 00:33:40,250
If you leave, don't come back!

350
00:33:50,580 --> 00:33:51,440
In the end,

351
00:33:52,110 --> 00:33:54,900
just accept what you can't change.

352
00:33:55,730 --> 00:33:57,130
Like death.

353
00:33:58,160 --> 00:33:59,460
Like fate.

354
00:34:00,790 --> 00:34:02,910
Can't fate be changed?

355
00:34:05,660 --> 00:34:07,160
Do you believe in destiny?

356
00:34:09,020 --> 00:34:10,900
What I want to destroy

357
00:34:11,790 --> 00:34:14,580
is what the Goddess is destined to protect.

358
00:34:15,610 --> 00:34:17,150
This is not destiny.

359
00:34:18,580 --> 00:34:20,110
This is my karma.

360
00:34:22,840 --> 00:34:24,590
I know I can't persuade you,

361
00:34:25,590 --> 00:34:26,870
but I believe

362
00:34:27,080 --> 00:34:28,340
that one day,

363
00:34:28,389 --> 00:34:31,190
you will meet the person who makes you want to live.

364
00:34:37,449 --> 00:34:38,780
She said it's possible,

365
00:34:39,500 --> 00:34:40,820
but I don't think so.

366
00:34:42,860 --> 00:34:43,989
What about you?

367
00:34:46,300 --> 00:34:47,690
Will you die too?

368
00:34:51,409 --> 00:34:52,320
Probably.

369
00:35:15,940 --> 00:35:17,500
[The Great Demon will be with Wen Xiao as long as he lives]

370
00:35:17,870 --> 00:35:19,230
But don't worry.

371
00:35:20,190 --> 00:35:22,030
I won't die easily.

372
00:35:23,100 --> 00:35:25,090
I will always be by your side.

373
00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:28,470
Demons live longer than humans.

374
00:35:28,020 --> 00:35:33,340
[The Great Demon will be with Wen Xiao as long as he lives]

375
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:31,930
I won't leave you by yourself.

376
00:36:07,300 --> 00:36:08,330
I'm not...

377
00:36:08,340 --> 00:36:09,100
My head.

378
00:36:09,130 --> 00:36:10,830
My head.

379
00:36:10,870 --> 00:36:12,150
I'm going to lose my head.

380
00:36:12,150 --> 00:36:14,030
What should I do about my head?

381
00:36:15,960 --> 00:36:17,150
My head!

382
00:36:17,170 --> 00:36:18,110
Mr. Bai Jiu.

383
00:36:18,130 --> 00:36:18,630
Mr. Zhuo

384
00:36:18,630 --> 00:36:21,370
and the others have successfully solved the Water Ghost bride case.

385
00:36:21,370 --> 00:36:23,110
The military order is completed successfully.

386
00:36:23,110 --> 00:36:24,670
Mr. Fan asked me to tell you

387
00:36:24,670 --> 00:36:25,870
not to worry anymore.

388
00:36:25,990 --> 00:36:27,110
Really?

389
00:36:27,210 --> 00:36:28,690
That's great!

390
00:36:28,710 --> 00:36:29,510
Brother Zhuo!

391
00:36:29,550 --> 00:36:30,460
Brother Zhuo!

392
00:36:30,510 --> 00:36:31,590
Watch out, Mr. Bai!

393
00:36:41,910 --> 00:36:42,790
Mr. Bai,

394
00:36:42,790 --> 00:36:45,650
why do you carry so many medicinal bottles with you?

395
00:36:53,420 --> 00:36:56,020
The Demon Hunting Bureau has saved ourselves.

396
00:36:57,610 --> 00:36:58,680
Unfortunately,

397
00:37:00,510 --> 00:37:01,970
we couldn't save the fish.

398
00:37:05,750 --> 00:37:08,500
At least their last moments were happy.

399
00:37:09,750 --> 00:37:11,150
Is happiness important?

400
00:37:12,720 --> 00:37:13,710
Of course.

401
00:37:15,390 --> 00:37:17,590
Actually, happiness isn't important.

402
00:37:18,670 --> 00:37:19,610
You're a demon.

403
00:37:19,880 --> 00:37:21,140
You don't understand.

404
00:37:23,980 --> 00:37:25,650
It's because I'm a demon

405
00:37:26,630 --> 00:37:28,110
that I understand

406
00:37:28,390 --> 00:37:29,990
happiness is not important.

407
00:37:31,510 --> 00:37:33,390
Because every human emotion

408
00:37:34,540 --> 00:37:35,550
is important.

409
00:37:37,280 --> 00:37:38,990
Joy, anger, sorrow, delight,

410
00:37:39,310 --> 00:37:41,570
grief, happiness, union, and separation

411
00:37:41,570 --> 00:37:43,760
converge into a long river.

412
00:37:44,840 --> 00:37:46,460
This long river

413
00:37:48,350 --> 00:37:49,680
is called "a lifetime."

414
00:37:51,830 --> 00:37:52,790
Did you know?

415
00:37:54,590 --> 00:37:56,160
For us demons,

416
00:37:57,070 --> 00:37:58,990
each emotion requires

417
00:37:59,390 --> 00:38:01,120
hundreds or thousands of years

418
00:38:01,390 --> 00:38:02,250
of cultivation

419
00:38:02,750 --> 00:38:04,350
to experience.

420
00:38:06,070 --> 00:38:07,610
So many demons

421
00:38:07,670 --> 00:38:08,990
go a lifetime

422
00:38:09,550 --> 00:38:11,810
without being able to shed a single tear.

423
00:38:14,110 --> 00:38:14,990
So,

424
00:38:16,750 --> 00:38:19,480
stop being obsessed with making everyone happy.

425
00:38:27,160 --> 00:38:29,020
You're still so weak.

426
00:38:29,850 --> 00:38:31,010
Are you worried?

427
00:38:37,710 --> 00:38:38,510
Of course.

428
00:38:39,560 --> 00:38:40,830
Is this worry

429
00:38:42,780 --> 00:38:44,290
also

430
00:38:45,750 --> 00:38:47,990
an important experience for you?

431
00:38:52,470 --> 00:38:53,270
Yes.

432
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:56,130
Then was pretending you didn't know me

433
00:38:56,360 --> 00:38:59,500
and watching me being confused and ignorant

434
00:39:01,470 --> 00:39:03,630
also an important experience?

435
00:39:10,440 --> 00:39:11,660
Zhao Yuanzhou,

436
00:39:14,420 --> 00:39:15,750
you broke your promise.

437
00:39:18,910 --> 00:39:20,290
Which one?

438
00:39:21,750 --> 00:39:23,030
The same pace

439
00:39:24,510 --> 00:39:26,120
or being colleagues?

440
00:39:27,750 --> 00:39:28,950
You said

441
00:39:31,160 --> 00:39:32,560
you would come to me.

442
00:39:42,230 --> 00:39:43,140
Great Demon,

443
00:39:43,900 --> 00:39:45,310
where are you taking me?

444
00:39:46,300 --> 00:39:47,250
Tiandu.

445
00:39:48,110 --> 00:39:50,440
Aren't you going to keep taking care of me?

446
00:39:52,420 --> 00:39:54,180
I will definitely come to you.

447
00:40:00,650 --> 00:40:02,430
I will definitely come to you.

448
00:40:20,170 --> 00:40:21,320
Haven't I

449
00:40:21,980 --> 00:40:23,720
come to you now?

450
00:40:24,960 --> 00:40:26,170
Then why

451
00:40:27,500 --> 00:40:29,670
didn't you tell me who you were?

452
00:40:32,370 --> 00:40:34,040
Think of it as...

453
00:40:41,840 --> 00:40:43,700
Getting to know each other again.

454
00:40:48,130 --> 00:40:50,670
â™«A lone boat drifts through the worldâ™«

455
00:40:50,710 --> 00:40:53,320
â™«The heart feels bitter, then sweetâ™«

456
00:40:53,620 --> 00:40:58,690
â™«Can't distinguish night from dayâ™«

457
00:40:58,500 --> 00:41:00,350
I will definitely come to you.

458
00:41:00,020 --> 00:41:01,940
â™«At the edge of the dreamscapeâ™«

459
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:04,620
â™«Someone is longing forâ™«

460
00:41:04,690 --> 00:41:06,200
â™«Softly calling forâ™«

461
00:41:06,230 --> 00:41:10,240
â™«A past that can't be brought backâ™«

462
00:41:23,890 --> 00:41:26,120
If you break the contract

463
00:41:26,330 --> 00:41:27,860
you signed with demon blood,

464
00:41:27,860 --> 00:41:29,540
your soul will vanish.

465
00:41:29,310 --> 00:41:31,440
[Zhao Yuanzhou] [Zhu Yan]

466
00:41:29,740 --> 00:41:31,370
I'm willing

467
00:41:31,400 --> 00:41:33,030
to work with her willingly

468
00:41:33,070 --> 00:41:35,550
like her colleague.

469
00:41:35,550 --> 00:41:36,670
Keep it in mind.

470
00:41:36,670 --> 00:41:38,330
It's the most important term.

471
00:41:40,280 --> 00:41:41,540
Zhao Yuanzhou.

472
00:41:43,630 --> 00:41:44,750
Zhao Yuanzhou!

473
00:41:44,980 --> 00:41:46,170
Zhao Yuanzhou!

474
00:42:26,430 --> 00:42:27,480
Are you okay?

475
00:42:34,110 --> 00:42:36,350
I think I'm about to die.

476
00:42:38,670 --> 00:42:41,310
Mr. Zhuo's Cloud Light Sword is amazing.

477
00:42:56,190 --> 00:42:57,850
Aren't you a great demon?

478
00:42:58,160 --> 00:43:00,760
How can you die after being stabbed a few times?

479
00:43:14,490 --> 00:43:15,820
It's improper for men and women to touch each other.

480
00:43:15,820 --> 00:43:16,680
Even if you want to die,

481
00:43:16,680 --> 00:43:18,350
don't die in Wen Xiao's arms.

482
00:43:26,740 --> 00:43:27,840
It's okay.

483
00:43:29,290 --> 00:43:30,810
I've lived too long.

484
00:43:32,190 --> 00:43:33,400
I'm tired of it.

485
00:43:36,580 --> 00:43:37,710
What a coincidence.

486
00:43:38,960 --> 00:43:40,690
That's what my name means.

487
00:43:41,700 --> 00:43:43,500
You're annoying like your name.

488
00:43:46,480 --> 00:43:48,170
I bear heavy sins

489
00:43:49,240 --> 00:43:50,900
and should have died long ago.

490
00:43:52,320 --> 00:43:53,800
So, Wen Xiao,

491
00:43:55,960 --> 00:43:57,830
don't be sad for me.

492
00:43:59,230 --> 00:44:00,670
The dead demons

493
00:44:01,320 --> 00:44:03,430
become the sun, moon, and stars.

494
00:44:05,510 --> 00:44:06,940
I can also turn into rain.

495
00:44:08,650 --> 00:44:10,640
From now on, whenever it rains,

496
00:44:14,420 --> 00:44:16,360
it'll be me keeping you company.

497
00:44:39,350 --> 00:44:41,400
Actually, I don't like rainy days.

498
00:44:44,510 --> 00:44:46,360
And didn't you say before

499
00:44:49,040 --> 00:44:50,820
you would stay with me

500
00:44:53,030 --> 00:44:54,670
and you wouldn't die easily?

501
00:45:18,150 --> 00:45:19,100
Zhao Yuanzhou.

502
00:45:19,130 --> 00:45:20,120
You are

503
00:45:20,180 --> 00:45:21,470
ridiculous!

504
00:45:27,050 --> 00:45:27,850
Wen Xiao,

505
00:45:27,870 --> 00:45:28,670
he's lying.

506
00:45:28,670 --> 00:45:29,310
Look.

507
00:45:45,400 --> 00:45:46,670
Mr. Zhuo, are you here to thank me

508
00:45:46,670 --> 00:45:48,070
for saving your life?

509
00:45:48,870 --> 00:45:49,940
It's nothing.

510
00:45:50,180 --> 00:45:51,440
Don't get off-topic.

511
00:45:52,590 --> 00:45:53,470
Why did you

512
00:45:54,640 --> 00:45:56,270
kill my father and brother back then?

513
00:45:56,270 --> 00:45:58,730
Although he had no choice,

514
00:45:58,760 --> 00:46:03,270
he did kill your father and brother.

515
00:46:03,430 --> 00:46:05,050
What did Li Lun mean when he said

516
00:46:05,050 --> 00:46:06,420
you had no choice?

517
00:46:19,200 --> 00:46:21,600
I saw it in my dream just now.

518
00:46:22,510 --> 00:46:24,510
He was controlled by the malicious energy.

519
00:46:24,510 --> 00:46:25,700
He had no choice.

520
00:46:25,740 --> 00:46:28,270
That's why he lost control and killed people.

521
00:46:30,830 --> 00:46:31,750
But killing

522
00:46:32,790 --> 00:46:33,950
is killing.

523
00:46:41,790 --> 00:46:42,710
In this world,

524
00:46:43,890 --> 00:46:45,950
there are too many who have no choice.

525
00:46:47,710 --> 00:46:49,660
Some people become robbers

526
00:46:49,830 --> 00:46:50,960
because of poverty.

527
00:46:53,350 --> 00:46:55,880
They commit evil because they are desperate.

528
00:46:57,760 --> 00:46:59,620
They kill because of hatred.

529
00:47:00,980 --> 00:47:03,310
Ran Yi also started killing because he was

530
00:47:03,470 --> 00:47:05,250
harmed by Master Qi.

531
00:47:06,680 --> 00:47:07,990
But these

532
00:47:08,840 --> 00:47:12,050
can't be the excuse for them to escape punishment.

533
00:47:26,130 --> 00:47:27,840
Donâ€™t worry, Mr. Zhuo.

534
00:47:30,330 --> 00:47:32,070
Iâ€™ll pay back my debts

535
00:47:34,610 --> 00:47:36,700
after the Baize Token is found.

536
00:47:40,250 --> 00:47:41,300
I will do

537
00:47:42,270 --> 00:47:43,700
what I promised you.

538
00:47:49,830 --> 00:47:50,600
Alright.

539
00:47:51,080 --> 00:47:52,310
We'll talk about

540
00:47:52,510 --> 00:47:54,040
your grudges another time.

541
00:47:54,150 --> 00:47:56,530
Right now, we have to meet up with Ms. Pei

542
00:47:57,030 --> 00:47:58,030
and go back to report.
