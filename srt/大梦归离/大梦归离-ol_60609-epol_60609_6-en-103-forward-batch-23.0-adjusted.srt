[Episode 6]

3
00:02:12,229 --> 00:02:13,229
Zhu Yan.

4
00:02:13,870 --> 00:02:16,630
I still like to talk to you face to face.

5
00:02:24,070 --> 00:02:25,750
Zhao Yuanzhou.

6
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:29,790
Our game

7
00:02:31,020 --> 00:02:33,350
has just begun.

8
00:02:42,530 --> 00:02:44,090
It really was you.

9
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:19,520
Are you okay?

10
00:03:21,190 --> 00:03:22,340
What are you doing?

11
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:26,240
I did it to save you two.

12
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:27,540
Did I ask you to save me?

13
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:32,360
I won't die anyway.

14
00:03:33,030 --> 00:03:35,160
Taking a few hits for you is no big deal.

15
00:03:41,079 --> 00:03:42,360
Who is he?

16
00:03:43,710 --> 00:03:45,760
A scumbag who has to

17
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:47,610
stay hidden.

18
00:03:56,200 --> 00:03:57,530
What happened to Ran Yi?

19
00:03:58,370 --> 00:04:00,310
Ran Yi was controlled by Li Lun.

20
00:04:00,890 --> 00:04:02,579
Weak demons

21
00:04:03,150 --> 00:04:05,550
are easily controlled by powerful demons.

22
00:04:07,460 --> 00:04:08,270
Zhu Yan,

23
00:04:10,030 --> 00:04:13,579
you're making worse and worse friends.

24
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:18,640
At least, you used to hang out with the Baize Goddess.

25
00:04:20,620 --> 00:04:21,590
Now,

26
00:04:21,590 --> 00:04:23,540
even these cheap things

27
00:04:23,540 --> 00:04:25,350
can order you around.

28
00:04:29,230 --> 00:04:30,730
You didn't know, right?

29
00:04:32,210 --> 00:04:35,330
He and Zhao Wan'er were as close as brother and sister.

30
00:04:36,730 --> 00:04:39,110
Zhao Wan'er even gave him

31
00:04:39,130 --> 00:04:42,070
the name of her late brother, Zhao Yuanzhou.

32
00:04:43,709 --> 00:04:44,779
Zhu Yan.

33
00:04:46,470 --> 00:04:48,140
Am I right?

34
00:04:49,630 --> 00:04:52,240
One was the noble Baize Goddess.

35
00:04:52,670 --> 00:04:55,690
One was the evil great demon, Zhu Yan.

36
00:04:57,870 --> 00:04:59,600
Because he didn't want others to know

37
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:01,430
they were close,

38
00:05:03,220 --> 00:05:04,670
every time

39
00:05:04,670 --> 00:05:07,390
he was with Zhao Wan'er,

40
00:05:08,990 --> 00:05:10,790
he would wear a mask.

41
00:05:15,510 --> 00:05:16,630
It really is you.

42
00:05:47,740 --> 00:05:49,020
Zhuo Yichen,

43
00:05:50,330 --> 00:05:52,520
don't you want to

44
00:05:53,190 --> 00:05:55,020
avenge your blood feud?

45
00:05:56,460 --> 00:05:58,680
Although he had no choice,

46
00:05:59,710 --> 00:06:03,110
he did kill your father and brother.

47
00:06:04,470 --> 00:06:06,690
If your dead father and brother

48
00:06:06,750 --> 00:06:10,060
saw you fighting alongside the enemy,

49
00:06:10,610 --> 00:06:12,420
how could they

50
00:06:14,180 --> 00:06:15,810
rest in peace?

51
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:21,030
I can't kill him.

52
00:06:23,470 --> 00:06:24,830
You can.

53
00:06:27,050 --> 00:06:29,330
With my help,

54
00:06:30,570 --> 00:06:32,200
you can.

55
00:06:37,670 --> 00:06:38,560
Okay.

56
00:06:58,409 --> 00:07:01,720
Humans always love to lie.

57
00:07:01,830 --> 00:07:04,220
I will kill Zhao Yuanzhou.

58
00:07:05,250 --> 00:07:09,210
But first, I need to kill you, an even more evil thing.

59
00:07:10,350 --> 00:07:12,210
If you kill me,

60
00:07:13,770 --> 00:07:16,720
no one will know where the Baize Token is.

61
00:07:16,750 --> 00:07:19,210
You know the whereabouts of the Baize Token?

62
00:07:20,470 --> 00:07:22,790
On the night Zhao Wan'er died,

63
00:07:23,530 --> 00:07:25,080
I was sealed,

64
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:28,800
but I was the only conscious person at the scene.

65
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,600
Naturally, I saw where the Baize Token went.

66
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:33,840
Where is it?

67
00:07:37,110 --> 00:07:39,030
It's on you.

68
00:07:43,590 --> 00:07:46,160
You saw it in your dream just now.

69
00:07:46,990 --> 00:07:48,160
Right?

70
00:07:55,900 --> 00:07:59,110
But now, you only have half of Baize Token,

71
00:08:00,159 --> 00:08:02,370
so you can’t use it.

72
00:08:02,710 --> 00:08:04,040
Where is the other half?

73
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:06,270
Do you want to know?

74
00:08:11,150 --> 00:08:12,980
But I don't want to tell you.

75
00:08:14,150 --> 00:08:16,380
You have to say it anyway.

76
00:08:45,570 --> 00:08:48,170
Ran Yi's dream control magic is useless on him.

77
00:08:55,380 --> 00:08:56,720
Really?

78
00:09:09,150 --> 00:09:11,550
He has been running away for so long.

79
00:09:13,010 --> 00:09:13,710
Today,

80
00:09:13,710 --> 00:09:16,540
let him sink into it.

81
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:41,440
Zhuo!

82
00:10:29,610 --> 00:10:30,410
Chen.

83
00:10:33,210 --> 00:10:35,110
Today is the Double Third Festival.

84
00:10:35,110 --> 00:10:36,910
Why are you still practicing?

85
00:10:37,150 --> 00:10:39,370
I want to practice my swordsmanship

86
00:10:39,510 --> 00:10:42,150
and help Father and Brother in the future.

87
00:10:43,140 --> 00:10:44,610
The Double Third Festival

88
00:10:45,570 --> 00:10:47,010
is not that fun.

89
00:10:49,310 --> 00:10:51,600
I still remember when you were seven,

90
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:53,640
you came crying

91
00:10:53,750 --> 00:10:54,950
to complain to me

92
00:10:55,790 --> 00:10:57,050
that the others

93
00:10:57,110 --> 00:10:58,970
weren't willing to play with you.

94
00:10:59,550 --> 00:11:01,150
Because your father

95
00:11:01,350 --> 00:11:02,240
and brother

96
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:04,500
were anomalies who hunted demons

97
00:11:05,270 --> 00:11:07,220
and dealt with demons all the time.

98
00:11:07,790 --> 00:11:09,060
One day,

99
00:11:09,090 --> 00:11:10,890
they would turn into demons too.

100
00:11:13,390 --> 00:11:14,180
Brother,

101
00:11:14,980 --> 00:11:17,310
you still remember the nonsense I said

102
00:11:17,950 --> 00:11:19,190
when I was a kid?

103
00:11:20,380 --> 00:11:22,260
But after so many years,

104
00:11:24,270 --> 00:11:26,400
you indeed haven't made many friends.

105
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:29,420
You're always alone.

106
00:11:33,740 --> 00:11:34,550
Brother.

107
00:11:37,750 --> 00:11:38,910
Did I

108
00:11:42,020 --> 00:11:44,620
turn myself into an anomaly?

109
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:48,320
So-called anomalies

110
00:11:49,390 --> 00:11:51,510
are just what narrow-minded people say

111
00:11:51,510 --> 00:11:53,250
in order to team up together

112
00:11:53,510 --> 00:11:56,110
and bring others down.

113
00:11:56,870 --> 00:11:57,860
They use this

114
00:11:58,070 --> 00:11:59,990
to show their righteousness

115
00:12:00,390 --> 00:12:02,650
and hide their own inferiority complex.

116
00:12:03,550 --> 00:12:04,110
Chen,

117
00:12:05,300 --> 00:12:06,780
we were born with

118
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:08,530
different responsibilities,

119
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,920
so we are destined to bear

120
00:12:10,990 --> 00:12:13,320
the pain that ordinary people don't have.

121
00:12:15,230 --> 00:12:15,760
Brother.

122
00:12:18,510 --> 00:12:20,230
Did you live like this too?

123
00:12:28,150 --> 00:12:29,310
Do you get lonely?

124
00:12:32,140 --> 00:12:33,600
Maybe one day,

125
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:36,430
you will meet someone

126
00:12:36,430 --> 00:12:38,550
you see as an anomaly.

127
00:12:40,150 --> 00:12:43,010
At that time, you'll need to make your own judgment.

128
00:12:43,630 --> 00:12:45,430
Your eyes lie.

129
00:12:46,590 --> 00:12:47,660
But your heart

130
00:12:47,870 --> 00:12:49,270
will tell you the answer.

131
00:12:53,390 --> 00:12:54,630
I believe you

132
00:12:55,230 --> 00:12:58,110
will surely meet like-minded companions.

133
00:12:59,230 --> 00:13:00,070
By then,

134
00:13:00,550 --> 00:13:02,150
you won't be lonely anymore.

135
00:13:06,950 --> 00:13:07,950
Will that happen?

136
00:13:09,750 --> 00:13:10,840
Of course.

137
00:13:13,390 --> 00:13:14,200
Remember,

138
00:13:15,950 --> 00:13:17,280
one wing is hard to keep.

139
00:13:18,340 --> 00:13:19,970
With two wings, you can soar.

140
00:14:04,850 --> 00:14:05,640
Zhuo!

141
00:14:42,940 --> 00:14:43,850
Zhuo!

142
00:14:45,470 --> 00:14:47,450
Zhuo!

143
00:15:45,070 --> 00:15:46,110
Wen Xiao!

144
00:16:19,960 --> 00:16:20,750
Zhuo Yichen!

145
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:22,160
Wake up!

146
00:16:23,630 --> 00:16:26,030
The Cloud Light Sword can kill demons and destroy evil

147
00:16:26,030 --> 00:16:27,260
without being tainted by demons.

148
00:16:27,260 --> 00:16:28,750
It can break through

149
00:16:28,750 --> 00:16:30,450
all demonic hallucinations.

150
00:16:53,230 --> 00:16:54,450
He can't be woken up.

151
00:16:56,190 --> 00:16:57,790
Because he has never

152
00:16:57,820 --> 00:17:00,400
truly faced his nightmare.

153
00:17:01,060 --> 00:17:02,820
All these years,

154
00:17:03,390 --> 00:17:06,180
he has never had a dream.

155
00:17:07,840 --> 00:17:12,260
So he can't tell if it's a dream or not.

156
00:17:15,080 --> 00:17:17,550
He won't wake up.

157
00:17:19,910 --> 00:17:21,000
Zhuo!

158
00:18:42,030 --> 00:18:43,510
Zhuo Yichen.

159
00:18:45,570 --> 00:18:47,980
If I'm your nightmare,

160
00:18:52,100 --> 00:18:54,740
then pierce me.

161
00:19:30,950 --> 00:19:32,430
My nightmare

162
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,430
isn't you.

163
00:19:43,430 --> 00:19:45,230
It's myself.

164
00:19:51,390 --> 00:19:53,540
I'm afraid of dreaming

165
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:55,980
and don't have dreams,

166
00:19:58,950 --> 00:20:00,880
so after my brother died,

167
00:20:01,670 --> 00:20:03,710
I never saw him in my dreams again.

168
00:20:07,780 --> 00:20:09,410
What I must overcome

169
00:20:11,430 --> 00:20:13,830
is myself, who has always been running away

170
00:20:15,470 --> 00:20:17,640
and has always been cowardly.

171
00:20:30,150 --> 00:20:31,720
My nightmare

172
00:20:32,230 --> 00:20:33,460
is myself!

173
00:20:32,980 --> 00:20:39,000
♫Someday I'll return to my old hometown♫

174
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:45,880
♫Wearing old clothes but with eyes shining bright♫

175
00:20:46,850 --> 00:20:48,840
♫Holding brilliance in the right hand♫

but is in the mortal world.

185
00:21:28,260 --> 00:21:31,150
The galaxy is slim and we hold hands.

Ran Yi.

193
00:22:18,700 --> 00:22:20,600
Miss Qi.

194

Ran Yi.

195

No.

Ran Yi.

197
00:22:58,390 --> 00:23:00,530
She has been parasitized for too long.

198
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:02,880
Her internal organs

199
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:06,450
have been corroded by the malicious energy of Li Lun.

200
00:23:52,110 --> 00:23:53,150
Ran Yi.

201
00:23:56,110 --> 00:23:57,670
Do you remember

202
00:23:59,030 --> 00:24:02,410
the first time we met?

203
00:24:03,180 --> 00:24:04,310
Master,

204
00:24:04,430 --> 00:24:07,560
someone took down the notice of your search for famous doctors

205
00:24:07,560 --> 00:24:09,370
and said he can cure the lady's illness.

206
00:24:09,370 --> 00:24:10,210
But he...

207
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:11,990
He's a little strange.

208
00:24:35,740 --> 00:24:37,740
When we first met,

209
00:24:38,630 --> 00:24:39,920
you covered your face

210
00:24:40,030 --> 00:24:41,780
with fabric

211
00:24:42,500 --> 00:24:44,630
and only revealed your eyes.

212
00:24:47,140 --> 00:24:49,690
But I will always remember

213
00:24:50,020 --> 00:24:51,620
those eyes.

214
00:24:52,930 --> 00:24:54,580
They were like

215
00:24:54,630 --> 00:24:57,490
a lake under the moonlit night sky.

216
00:24:57,950 --> 00:24:59,060
So beautiful.

217
00:25:03,510 --> 00:25:04,160
No.

218
00:25:07,570 --> 00:25:09,200
That wasn't the first time.

219
00:25:21,950 --> 00:25:22,750
My Lady,

220
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:24,960
why do you always come to the lake?

221
00:25:27,380 --> 00:25:28,780
The books say,

222
00:25:29,710 --> 00:25:31,390
"All rivers return to the sea

223
00:25:31,740 --> 00:25:33,740
and all water returns to the abyss."

224
00:25:35,710 --> 00:25:37,630
But look at this lake.

225
00:25:38,590 --> 00:25:40,790
It's always trapped deep in the forest.

226
00:25:41,460 --> 00:25:43,910
Do you think it can return to the sea?

227
00:25:48,100 --> 00:25:49,360
Who's there?

228
00:25:53,860 --> 00:25:56,460
I was being chased by a demon hunter at the time.

229
00:25:56,760 --> 00:25:58,390
I was severely injured

230
00:25:58,980 --> 00:26:00,840
and was drifting along the water.

231
00:26:02,020 --> 00:26:03,480
In a daze,

232
00:26:04,470 --> 00:26:05,820
I saw you.

233
00:26:20,830 --> 00:26:22,960
I mustered all my strength

234
00:26:23,630 --> 00:26:24,720
to open my eyes

235
00:26:24,750 --> 00:26:26,150
and see you.

236
00:26:27,230 --> 00:26:30,440
You were like the legendary goddess of the Wilderness.

237
00:26:30,860 --> 00:26:32,510
Your eyes were gentle

238
00:26:32,750 --> 00:26:34,090
and compassionate.

239
00:26:34,920 --> 00:26:35,910
Go on.

240
00:26:37,990 --> 00:26:38,920
Go on.

241
00:26:42,730 --> 00:26:43,470
At that time,

242
00:26:43,470 --> 00:26:44,670
I told myself

243
00:26:46,160 --> 00:26:48,070
I must see you again.

244
00:26:50,070 --> 00:26:52,160
You've swum to many places.

245
00:26:52,870 --> 00:26:55,530
You must have seen a lot of beautiful sceneries.

246
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:01,280
You're so silly.

247
00:27:02,620 --> 00:27:04,680
You've recovered,

248
00:27:06,610 --> 00:27:08,650
but you still refuse to leave.

249
00:27:10,430 --> 00:27:11,550
You can swim

250
00:27:11,570 --> 00:27:13,460
freely in the world,

251
00:27:14,030 --> 00:27:15,630
but you insist on

252
00:27:16,930 --> 00:27:19,160
being trapped in this cage with me.

253
00:27:42,590 --> 00:27:44,580
The sea is vast.

254
00:27:45,230 --> 00:27:47,020
There's no way out,

255
00:27:48,470 --> 00:27:50,230
but it is in the mortal world.

256
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:56,360
I remember everything you said,

257
00:27:58,090 --> 00:28:00,590
the scenery you wanted to see,

258
00:28:01,160 --> 00:28:03,880
and all kinds of life you wanted to experience.

259
00:28:04,910 --> 00:28:07,210
So from then on,

260
00:28:08,610 --> 00:28:09,510
every night,

261
00:28:09,510 --> 00:28:11,710
I created a dream for you,

262
00:28:12,420 --> 00:28:14,820
so that the wishes you couldn't fulfill

263
00:28:14,910 --> 00:28:16,640
when trapped behind high walls

264
00:28:17,270 --> 00:28:18,630
could come true.

265
00:28:33,120 --> 00:28:35,650
I was willing to be with you forever like this,

266
00:28:36,270 --> 00:28:38,320
even if I had to abandon my freedom

267
00:28:38,760 --> 00:28:41,570
and just be a fish in your fish tank.

268
00:28:44,030 --> 00:28:45,470
But dream control magic

269
00:28:46,110 --> 00:28:47,570
is demonic, after all.

270
00:28:48,790 --> 00:28:51,320
The longer a person stays in a dream,

271
00:28:51,470 --> 00:28:53,030
the weaker one becomes.

272
00:28:53,070 --> 00:28:55,230
I couldn't create dreams for you anymore.

273
00:28:55,230 --> 00:28:56,420
Master.

274
00:28:56,440 --> 00:28:58,620
The lady is still not getting better.

275
00:28:58,870 --> 00:29:00,000
These past few days,

276
00:29:00,020 --> 00:29:01,520
she's become bedridden.

277
00:29:03,760 --> 00:29:05,990
That's why I became a doctor

278
00:29:06,390 --> 00:29:07,680
to accompany you.

279
00:29:09,950 --> 00:29:11,270

280

[Classic of Mountains and Seas]

282
00:29:14,950 --> 00:29:16,300
read travel books,

283
00:29:17,740 --> 00:29:20,200
and talked about the world outside with you.

284
00:29:21,030 --> 00:29:22,670
My favorite phrase

285
00:29:24,750 --> 00:29:26,350
is "dreams come true."

286
00:29:29,650 --> 00:29:31,220
When I say it,

287
00:29:33,550 --> 00:29:35,110
I feel so happy.

288
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:40,280
Whether you are a human

289
00:29:40,300 --> 00:29:41,710
or a demon,

290
00:29:44,160 --> 00:29:46,080
you are both my path

291
00:29:47,210 --> 00:29:48,490
and destination.

292
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:54,320
Meeting you

293
00:29:55,090 --> 00:29:57,520
is the happiest thing in my life.

294
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:01,040
I've never regretted it.

295
00:30:03,430 --> 00:30:04,350
Thank you

296
00:30:06,140 --> 00:30:07,960
for giving me the best dream.

297
00:30:11,390 --> 00:30:12,610
But those dreams

298
00:30:13,300 --> 00:30:14,580
hurt you.

299
00:30:17,320 --> 00:30:19,320
I'm not talking about those dreams.

300
00:30:23,290 --> 00:30:24,890
I mean now.

301

He destroyed his inner core.

304
00:31:45,320 --> 00:31:47,070
You once said

305
00:31:47,890 --> 00:31:49,890
you would take me to the Wilderness,

306
00:31:50,180 --> 00:31:51,900
to your hometown.

307
00:31:52,960 --> 00:31:53,770
Yes.

Leave.

349
00:34:01,590 --> 00:34:03,250
If you leave, don't come back!

350
00:34:13,580 --> 00:34:14,440
In the end,

351
00:34:15,110 --> 00:34:17,900
just accept what you can't change.

352
00:34:18,730 --> 00:34:20,130
Like death.

353
00:34:21,160 --> 00:34:22,460
Like fate.

354
00:34:23,790 --> 00:34:25,910
Can't fate be changed?

355
00:34:28,660 --> 00:34:30,160
Do you believe in destiny?

356
00:34:32,020 --> 00:34:33,900
What I want to destroy

357
00:34:34,790 --> 00:34:37,580
is what the Goddess is destined to protect.

358
00:34:38,610 --> 00:34:40,150
This is not destiny.

359
00:34:41,580 --> 00:34:43,110
This is my karma.

360
00:34:45,840 --> 00:34:47,590
I know I can't persuade you,

361
00:34:48,590 --> 00:34:49,870
but I believe

362
00:34:50,080 --> 00:34:51,340
that one day,

363
00:34:51,389 --> 00:34:54,190
you will meet the person who makes you want to live.

364
00:35:00,449 --> 00:35:01,780
She said it's possible,

365
00:35:02,500 --> 00:35:03,820
but I don't think so.

366
00:35:05,860 --> 00:35:06,989
What about you?

367
00:35:09,300 --> 00:35:10,690
Will you die too?

368
00:35:14,409 --> 00:35:15,320
Probably.

369
00:35:38,940 --> 00:35:40,500
[The Great Demon will be with Wen Xiao as long as he lives]

370
00:35:40,870 --> 00:35:42,230
But don't worry.

371
00:35:43,190 --> 00:35:45,030
I won't die easily.

372
00:35:46,100 --> 00:35:48,090
I will always be by your side.

373
00:35:49,880 --> 00:35:51,470
Demons live longer than humans.

374
00:35:51,020 --> 00:35:56,340
[The Great Demon will be with Wen Xiao as long as he lives]

375
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:54,930
I won't leave you by yourself.

376
00:36:30,300 --> 00:36:31,330
I'm not...

377
00:36:31,340 --> 00:36:32,100
My head.

378
00:36:32,130 --> 00:36:33,830
My head.

379
00:36:33,870 --> 00:36:35,150
I'm going to lose my head.

380
00:36:35,150 --> 00:36:37,030
What should I do about my head?

381
00:36:38,960 --> 00:36:40,150
My head!

382
00:36:40,170 --> 00:36:41,110
Mr. Bai Jiu.

383
00:36:41,130 --> 00:36:41,630
Mr. Zhuo

384
00:36:41,630 --> 00:36:44,370
and the others have successfully solved the Water Ghost bride case.

385
00:36:44,370 --> 00:36:46,110
The military order is completed successfully.

386
00:36:46,110 --> 00:36:47,670
Mr. Fan asked me to tell you

387
00:36:47,670 --> 00:36:48,870
not to worry anymore.

388
00:36:48,990 --> 00:36:50,110
Really?

389
00:36:50,210 --> 00:36:51,690
That's great!

390
00:36:51,710 --> 00:36:52,510
Brother Zhuo!

391
00:36:52,550 --> 00:36:53,460
Brother Zhuo!

392
00:36:53,510 --> 00:36:54,590
Watch out, Mr. Bai!

393
00:37:04,910 --> 00:37:05,790
Mr. Bai,

394
00:37:05,790 --> 00:37:08,650
why do you carry so many medicinal bottles with you?

395
00:37:16,420 --> 00:37:19,020
The Demon Hunting Bureau has saved ourselves.

396
00:37:20,610 --> 00:37:21,680
Unfortunately,

397
00:37:23,510 --> 00:37:24,970
we couldn't save the fish.

398
00:37:28,750 --> 00:37:31,500
At least their last moments were happy.

399
00:37:32,750 --> 00:37:34,150
Is happiness important?

400
00:37:35,720 --> 00:37:36,710
Of course.

401
00:37:38,390 --> 00:37:40,590
Actually, happiness isn't important.

402
00:37:41,670 --> 00:37:42,610
You're a demon.

403
00:37:42,880 --> 00:37:44,140
You don't understand.

404
00:37:46,980 --> 00:37:48,650
It's because I'm a demon

405
00:37:49,630 --> 00:37:51,110
that I understand

406
00:37:51,390 --> 00:37:52,990
happiness is not important.

407
00:37:54,510 --> 00:37:56,390
Because every human emotion

408
00:37:57,540 --> 00:37:58,550
is important.

409
00:38:00,280 --> 00:38:01,990
Joy, anger, sorrow, delight,

410
00:38:02,310 --> 00:38:04,570
grief, happiness, union, and separation

411
00:38:04,570 --> 00:38:06,760
converge into a long river.

412
00:38:07,840 --> 00:38:09,460
This long river

413
00:38:11,350 --> 00:38:12,680
is called "a lifetime."

414
00:38:14,830 --> 00:38:15,790
Did you know?

415
00:38:17,590 --> 00:38:19,160
For us demons,

416
00:38:20,070 --> 00:38:21,990
each emotion requires

417
00:38:22,390 --> 00:38:24,120
hundreds or thousands of years

418
00:38:24,390 --> 00:38:25,250
of cultivation

419
00:38:25,750 --> 00:38:27,350
to experience.

420
00:38:29,070 --> 00:38:30,610
So many demons

421
00:38:30,670 --> 00:38:31,990
go a lifetime

422
00:38:32,550 --> 00:38:34,810
without being able to shed a single tear.

423
00:38:37,110 --> 00:38:37,990
So,

424
00:38:39,750 --> 00:38:42,480
stop being obsessed with making everyone happy.

425
00:38:50,160 --> 00:38:52,020
You're still so weak.

426
00:38:52,850 --> 00:38:54,010
Are you worried?

427
00:39:00,710 --> 00:39:01,510
Of course.

428
00:39:02,560 --> 00:39:03,830
Is this worry

429
00:39:05,780 --> 00:39:07,290
also

430
00:39:08,750 --> 00:39:10,990
an important experience for you?

431
00:39:15,470 --> 00:39:16,270
Yes.

432
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:19,130
Then was pretending you didn't know me

433
00:39:19,360 --> 00:39:22,500
and watching me being confused and ignorant

434
00:39:24,470 --> 00:39:26,630
also an important experience?

435
00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:34,660
Zhao Yuanzhou,

436
00:39:37,420 --> 00:39:38,750
you broke your promise.

437
00:39:41,910 --> 00:39:43,290
Which one?

438
00:39:44,750 --> 00:39:46,030
The same pace

439
00:39:47,510 --> 00:39:49,120
or being colleagues?

440
00:39:50,750 --> 00:39:51,950
You said

441
00:39:54,160 --> 00:39:55,560
you would come to me.

442
00:40:05,230 --> 00:40:06,140
Great Demon,

443
00:40:06,900 --> 00:40:08,310
where are you taking me?

444
00:40:09,300 --> 00:40:10,250
Tiandu.

445
00:40:11,110 --> 00:40:13,440
Aren't you going to keep taking care of me?

446
00:40:15,420 --> 00:40:17,180
I will definitely come to you.

447
00:40:23,650 --> 00:40:25,430
I will definitely come to you.

448
00:40:43,170 --> 00:40:44,320
Haven't I

449
00:40:44,980 --> 00:40:46,720
come to you now?

450
00:40:47,960 --> 00:40:49,170
Then why

451
00:40:50,500 --> 00:40:52,670
didn't you tell me who you were?

452
00:40:55,370 --> 00:40:57,040
Think of it as...

453
00:41:04,840 --> 00:41:06,700
Getting to know each other again.

454
00:41:11,130 --> 00:41:13,670
♫A lone boat drifts through the world♫

455
00:41:13,710 --> 00:41:16,320
♫The heart feels bitter, then sweet♫

456
00:41:16,620 --> 00:41:21,690
♫Can't distinguish night from day♫

457
00:41:21,500 --> 00:41:23,350
I will definitely come to you.

458
00:41:23,020 --> 00:41:24,940
♫At the edge of the dreamscape♫

459
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:27,620
♫Someone is longing for♫

460
00:41:27,690 --> 00:41:29,200
♫Softly calling for♫

461
00:41:29,230 --> 00:41:33,240
♫A past that can't be brought back♫

462
00:41:46,890 --> 00:41:49,120
If you break the contract

463
00:41:49,330 --> 00:41:50,860
you signed with demon blood,

464
00:41:50,860 --> 00:41:52,540
your soul will vanish.

465
00:41:52,310 --> 00:41:54,440
[Zhao Yuanzhou] [Zhu Yan]

466
00:41:52,740 --> 00:41:54,370
I'm willing

467
00:41:54,400 --> 00:41:56,030
to work with her willingly

468
00:41:56,070 --> 00:41:58,550
like her colleague.

469
00:41:58,550 --> 00:41:59,670
Keep it in mind.

470
00:41:59,670 --> 00:42:01,330
It's the most important term.

471
00:42:03,280 --> 00:42:04,540
Zhao Yuanzhou.

472
00:42:06,630 --> 00:42:07,750
Zhao Yuanzhou!

473
00:42:07,980 --> 00:42:09,170
Zhao Yuanzhou!

474
00:42:49,430 --> 00:42:50,480
Are you okay?

475
00:42:57,110 --> 00:42:59,350
I think I'm about to die.

476
00:43:01,670 --> 00:43:04,310
Mr. Zhuo's Cloud Light Sword is amazing.

477
00:43:19,190 --> 00:43:20,850
Aren't you a great demon?

478
00:43:21,160 --> 00:43:23,760
How can you die after being stabbed a few times?

479
00:43:37,490 --> 00:43:38,820
It's improper for men and women to touch each other.

480
00:43:38,820 --> 00:43:39,680
Even if you want to die,

481
00:43:39,680 --> 00:43:41,350
don't die in Wen Xiao's arms.

482
00:43:49,740 --> 00:43:50,840
It's okay.

483
00:43:52,290 --> 00:43:53,810
I've lived too long.

484
00:43:55,190 --> 00:43:56,400
I'm tired of it.

485
00:43:59,580 --> 00:44:00,710
What a coincidence.

486
00:44:01,960 --> 00:44:03,690
That's what my name means.

487
00:44:04,700 --> 00:44:06,500
You're annoying like your name.

488
00:44:09,480 --> 00:44:11,170
I bear heavy sins

489
00:44:12,240 --> 00:44:13,900
and should have died long ago.

490
00:44:15,320 --> 00:44:16,800
So, Wen Xiao,

491
00:44:18,960 --> 00:44:20,830
don't be sad for me.

492
00:44:22,230 --> 00:44:23,670
The dead demons

493
00:44:24,320 --> 00:44:26,430
become the sun, moon, and stars.

494
00:44:28,510 --> 00:44:29,940
I can also turn into rain.

495
00:44:31,650 --> 00:44:33,640
From now on, whenever it rains,

496
00:44:37,420 --> 00:44:39,360
it'll be me keeping you company.

497
00:45:02,350 --> 00:45:04,400
Actually, I don't like rainy days.

498
00:45:07,510 --> 00:45:09,360
And didn't you say before

499
00:45:12,040 --> 00:45:13,820
you would stay with me

500
00:45:16,030 --> 00:45:17,670
and you wouldn't die easily?

501
00:45:41,150 --> 00:45:42,100
Zhao Yuanzhou.

502
00:45:42,130 --> 00:45:43,120
You are

503
00:45:43,180 --> 00:45:44,470
ridiculous!

504
00:45:50,050 --> 00:45:50,850
Wen Xiao,

505
00:45:50,870 --> 00:45:51,670
he's lying.

506
00:45:51,670 --> 00:45:52,310
Look.

507
00:46:08,400 --> 00:46:09,670
Mr. Zhuo, are you here to thank me

508
00:46:09,670 --> 00:46:11,070
for saving your life?

509
00:46:11,870 --> 00:46:12,940
It's nothing.

510
00:46:13,180 --> 00:46:14,440
Don't get off-topic.

511
00:46:15,590 --> 00:46:16,470
Why did you

512
00:46:17,640 --> 00:46:19,270
kill my father and brother back then?

513
00:46:19,270 --> 00:46:21,730
Although he had no choice,

514
00:46:21,760 --> 00:46:26,270
he did kill your father and brother.

515
00:46:26,430 --> 00:46:28,050
What did Li Lun mean when he said

516
00:46:28,050 --> 00:46:29,420
you had no choice?

517
00:46:42,200 --> 00:46:44,600
I saw it in my dream just now.

518
00:46:45,510 --> 00:46:47,510
He was controlled by the malicious energy.

519
00:46:47,510 --> 00:46:48,700
He had no choice.

520
00:46:48,740 --> 00:46:51,270
That's why he lost control and killed people.

521
00:46:53,830 --> 00:46:54,750
But killing

522
00:46:55,790 --> 00:46:56,950
is killing.

523
00:47:04,790 --> 00:47:05,710
In this world,

524
00:47:06,890 --> 00:47:08,950
there are too many who have no choice.

525
00:47:10,710 --> 00:47:12,660
Some people become robbers

526
00:47:12,830 --> 00:47:13,960
because of poverty.

527
00:47:16,350 --> 00:47:18,880
They commit evil because they are desperate.

528
00:47:20,760 --> 00:47:22,620
They kill because of hatred.

529
00:47:23,980 --> 00:47:26,310
Ran Yi also started killing because he was

530
00:47:26,470 --> 00:47:28,250
harmed by Master Qi.

531
00:47:29,680 --> 00:47:30,990
But these

532
00:47:31,840 --> 00:47:35,050
can't be the excuse for them to escape punishment.

533
00:47:49,130 --> 00:47:50,840
Don’t worry, Mr. Zhuo.

534
00:47:53,330 --> 00:47:55,070
I’ll pay back my debts

535
00:47:57,610 --> 00:47:59,700
after the Baize Token is found.

536
00:48:03,250 --> 00:48:04,300
I will do

537
00:48:05,270 --> 00:48:06,700
what I promised you.

538
00:48:12,830 --> 00:48:13,600
Alright.

539
00:48:14,080 --> 00:48:15,310
We'll talk about

540
00:48:15,510 --> 00:48:17,040
your grudges another time.

541
00:48:17,150 --> 00:48:19,530
Right now, we have to meet up with Ms. Pei

542
00:48:20,030 --> 00:48:21,030
and go back to report.
