I'm not laughing because you're a kid.

There are no demons there.

87
00:10:36,550 --> 00:10:37,780

You need to destroy all the talismans.

91
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:44,190
Yes, sir.

92
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:16,600
But...

93
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:19,660
Why did Chongwu Camp's people ambush us?

94
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:21,280
From the beginning,

95
00:12:22,080 --> 00:12:23,760
this was a trap.

96
00:12:24,970 --> 00:12:26,750
As long as you lure the Demon Hunting Bureau's people

97
00:12:26,750 --> 00:12:28,120
to the demon hunters,

98
00:12:28,230 --> 00:12:31,390
I have my way of keeping them there.

99
00:12:32,520 --> 00:12:34,130
You appeared on purpose

100
00:12:35,230 --> 00:12:37,250
just to lure me away.

101
00:12:37,610 --> 00:12:39,280
Stupid Chongwu Camp.

102
00:12:40,060 --> 00:12:42,230
They don't deserve to fight you.

103
00:12:43,750 --> 00:12:46,040
Need I find the right match for a fight too?

104
00:12:46,040 --> 00:12:48,120
Everything in the world

105
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:50,590
deserves the right match.

106
00:12:54,910 --> 00:12:56,920
She is a goddess without divine power.

107
00:12:56,920 --> 00:12:59,430
She doesn't deserve to stand

108
00:12:59,640 --> 00:13:01,020
by your side.

109
00:13:04,220 --> 00:13:06,360
We're here to catch up as old friends.

110
00:13:07,740 --> 00:13:10,910
As for this joke of a goddess,

111
00:13:11,610 --> 00:13:13,710
let me kill her for you.

112
00:13:13,950 --> 00:13:16,120
You can try.

113
00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:21,640
How long can you protect her?

114
00:13:22,510 --> 00:13:24,610
For this moment,

115
00:13:25,330 --> 00:13:28,010
or forever?

116
00:13:36,610 --> 00:13:38,210
You don't have to protect me.

117
00:13:44,700 --> 00:13:47,180
The blood feud between me and Li Lun

118
00:13:47,880 --> 00:13:49,650
shall end here.

119
00:13:52,550 --> 00:13:53,000
Oh?

120
00:13:57,240 --> 00:13:59,630
You have no divine power now.

121
00:14:00,070 --> 00:14:02,520
All you have is the form of a weak mortal.

122
00:14:03,790 --> 00:14:04,790
End, you say?

123
00:14:07,820 --> 00:14:09,690
Do you mean ending your own life?

124
00:14:30,350 --> 00:14:31,760
A mortal's body

125
00:14:32,210 --> 00:14:35,120
can't bear the Truth Eye for a long time.

126
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:40,160
Aren't you just afraid she'll see your true form?

127
00:15:14,940 --> 00:15:16,300
This trick again?

128
00:15:16,590 --> 00:15:18,020
Didn't you say you wanted to

129
00:15:18,020 --> 00:15:19,580
end the blood feud today?

130
00:15:19,610 --> 00:15:21,680
A gentleman's revenge is never too late.

131
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:23,420
A lady's revenge must be flexible.

132
00:15:23,420 --> 00:15:23,980
What?

133
00:15:34,870 --> 00:15:36,000
Are you okay?

134
00:15:39,790 --> 00:15:40,600
Let me do it.

135
00:15:40,680 --> 00:15:41,410
I'm a doctor.

136
00:16:03,800 --> 00:16:05,260
Why are you crying?

137
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:09,660
You and Sister Pei are both good at fighting.

138
00:16:10,540 --> 00:16:12,120
If it weren't for me,

139
00:16:13,220 --> 00:16:14,950
you wouldn't have gotten hurt.

140
00:16:15,180 --> 00:16:16,660
I dragged you down.

141
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:22,990
But

142
00:16:22,990 --> 00:16:24,120
those talismans

143
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:25,800
were found

144
00:16:28,190 --> 00:16:30,040
and destroyed by you.

145
00:16:34,040 --> 00:16:34,840
Jiu.

146
00:16:36,390 --> 00:16:37,490
Without you,

147
00:16:38,430 --> 00:16:39,750
we might have gotten

148
00:16:39,750 --> 00:16:41,920
more than just a few injuries.

149
00:16:46,390 --> 00:16:47,620
Really?

150
00:16:48,150 --> 00:16:49,110
Mr. Zhuo?

151
00:16:52,590 --> 00:16:54,240
Sorry for the trouble, but...

152
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:55,310
Oh, it's no trouble at all.

153
00:16:55,310 --> 00:16:56,910
Can you work a little faster?

154
00:16:56,970 --> 00:16:58,590
My wound is still bleeding.

155
00:16:58,760 --> 00:16:59,400
Oh.

156
00:17:02,840 --> 00:17:05,160
The blood of the Bingyi Clan is useful,

157
00:17:05,390 --> 00:17:07,720
but it's very draining for you to use it.

158
00:17:08,360 --> 00:17:09,960
Try to use less in the future.

159
00:17:10,170 --> 00:17:11,670
I'll get you some ginger date cakes

160
00:17:11,670 --> 00:17:12,460
to replenish your blood.

161
00:17:12,460 --> 00:17:14,190
Let me see if I have more inside.

162
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:18,830
Enough.

163
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:21,120
Oh.

164
00:17:22,920 --> 00:17:23,640
Oh...

165
00:17:37,920 --> 00:17:38,760
Thank you.

166
00:17:50,300 --> 00:17:51,740
Are you talking to me?

167
00:17:52,609 --> 00:17:53,750
This time,

168
00:17:54,079 --> 00:17:55,339
it's all thanks to you.

169
00:17:57,890 --> 00:17:59,040
From now on,

170
00:17:59,960 --> 00:18:01,830
I won't look down on you anymore.

171
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:05,810
I promise that

172
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:07,380
as long as I'm here,

173
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:08,660
you will never die.

174
00:18:13,030 --> 00:18:14,490
You won't resign anymore?

175
00:18:16,410 --> 00:18:18,680
I'm telling Mr. Zhuo that I'm resigning.

176
00:18:24,310 --> 00:18:25,950
You're not the only one

177
00:18:26,110 --> 00:18:27,710
in the Demon Hunting Bureau.

178
00:18:28,670 --> 00:18:29,820
Next time,

179
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:31,740
you don't have to

180
00:18:31,820 --> 00:18:33,350
bear everything yourself.

181
00:18:33,900 --> 00:18:35,140
I’m the commander.

182
00:18:35,580 --> 00:18:38,240
I have the responsibility to protect all of you.

183
00:18:38,560 --> 00:18:40,020
I'm more skilled than you.

184
00:18:40,690 --> 00:18:43,550
I have the responsibility to protect all of you too.

185
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:50,750
Are you all right?

186
00:18:52,470 --> 00:18:54,470
Sister Pei and Mr. Zhuo are with me.

187
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:55,700
It's alright now.

188
00:18:57,350 --> 00:18:58,580
I trust you.

189
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:00,320
But I don't trust him.

190
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:09,320
Are you okay?

191
00:19:16,390 --> 00:19:17,500
I don't need it.

192
00:19:23,160 --> 00:19:24,960
Here's some free demonic energy

193
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:26,400
so that you can kill me

194
00:19:26,590 --> 00:19:27,790
easier in the future.

195
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:46,750
Traceless repair...

196
00:19:47,390 --> 00:19:49,200
I think I'm going to lose my job.

197
00:19:53,980 --> 00:19:57,130
♫The trees and grass of the world sway with the wind♫

198
00:19:57,190 --> 00:20:00,470
♫Beneath the bodhi tree, dust gathers♫

199
00:20:02,510 --> 00:20:05,520
♫Who truly decides fate's design?♫

200
00:20:05,560 --> 00:20:08,980
♫Vividly painted in black and white♫

201
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:13,280
Sir.

202
00:20:14,560 --> 00:20:15,350
It failed.

203
00:20:15,960 --> 00:20:17,090
You bunch of losers!

204
00:20:17,220 --> 00:20:19,880
You can't even handle the Demon Hunting Bureau?

205
00:20:31,490 --> 00:20:32,470
Who are you?

206
00:20:33,310 --> 00:20:35,980
I'm the only person who can kill him.

207
00:20:38,070 --> 00:20:39,500
Look at me.

208
00:20:59,420 --> 00:21:01,550
I want an answer.

209
00:21:03,160 --> 00:21:04,890
I have three questions for you.

210
00:21:05,510 --> 00:21:06,840
Get them right,

211
00:21:07,700 --> 00:21:08,480
and you live.

212
00:21:10,160 --> 00:21:11,400
Get them wrong,

213
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:13,680
and you die.

214
00:21:18,050 --> 00:21:19,510
First question.

215
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:22,640
Do you think it's better to be a human

216
00:21:23,480 --> 00:21:25,520
or a demon?

217
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:28,760
It's better to be a demon.

218
00:21:28,990 --> 00:21:29,800
A demon.

219
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:36,190
Wrong answer.

220
00:21:41,570 --> 00:21:43,470
Why didn't you tell me

221
00:21:43,730 --> 00:21:45,570
before killing one of my men?

222
00:21:46,430 --> 00:21:49,360
You didn't tell me before

223
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:52,250
you hurt Zhao Yuanzhou either.

224
00:21:53,940 --> 00:21:57,670
King Xiang sent him here to spy on Chongwu Camp.

225
00:21:57,880 --> 00:21:59,940
I thought he was a hindrance long ago.

226
00:22:00,250 --> 00:22:01,640
Thanks for killing him

227
00:22:01,660 --> 00:22:02,840
for me.

228
00:22:03,480 --> 00:22:04,640
I'm glad you know.

229
00:22:05,480 --> 00:22:06,640
Don't forget

230
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:09,340
our promise.

231
00:22:09,570 --> 00:22:11,710
I will help you find the Baize Token.

232
00:22:40,040 --> 00:22:41,010
My Lady.

233
00:22:43,160 --> 00:22:44,280
My Lady?

234
00:22:50,190 --> 00:22:54,710
[Third day since the Military Order]

235
00:22:56,570 --> 00:22:57,210
Oh my god!

236
00:22:57,240 --> 00:22:58,610
This is terrible.

237
00:22:58,840 --> 00:23:00,310
This won't do.

238
00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:02,560
This won't do.

239
00:23:03,540 --> 00:23:05,000
Why are you in such a hurry?

240
00:23:05,130 --> 00:23:06,260
Did you step on poop?

241
00:23:07,190 --> 00:23:07,920
It's all my fault.

242
00:23:07,920 --> 00:23:08,800
I'm too short

243
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:09,830
and too weak.

244
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:11,200
My medicine box is too small

245
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:12,680
to hold enough herbs and pills.

246
00:23:12,680 --> 00:23:14,960
I only managed to slightly replenish Mr. Zhuo's blood.

247
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:15,830
But I didn't have the

248
00:23:15,830 --> 00:23:16,680
multi-nutrition pill,

249
00:23:16,680 --> 00:23:17,560
tortoise and deer treatment gum,

250
00:23:17,560 --> 00:23:18,520
ancient wood liver-boosting powder,

251
00:23:18,520 --> 00:23:20,690
heavenly king heart-boosting pill...

252
00:23:20,690 --> 00:23:21,360
Mr. Zhuo

253
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:23,180
just cut his hand.

254
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:25,040
He wasn't hit by a carriage.

255
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:26,440
Oh, please.

256
00:23:26,770 --> 00:23:27,580
You don't understand.

257
00:23:27,580 --> 00:23:28,280
Do you think everyone

258
00:23:28,280 --> 00:23:29,400
is like you, Great Demon?

259
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:30,680
You have thick skin.

260
00:23:30,680 --> 00:23:31,640
You can heal wounds

261
00:23:31,640 --> 00:23:32,760
with a small spell.

262
00:23:32,840 --> 00:23:33,960
Before you arrived,

263
00:23:33,960 --> 00:23:36,140
Mr. Zhuo protected me and Sister Pei.

264
00:23:36,160 --> 00:23:36,620
Well...

265
00:23:36,630 --> 00:23:37,200
Well, he...

266
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:39,270
He was beaten up by that bad guy.

267
00:23:39,480 --> 00:23:40,650
So he's quite weak.

268
00:23:46,160 --> 00:23:47,520
Are you blind?

269
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:49,620
I'll bring you some medicine for your eyes next time.

270
00:23:49,620 --> 00:23:51,130
You should take some medicine

271
00:23:51,130 --> 00:23:52,500
and treat your eyes.

272
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:53,760
I am a great demon

273
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:55,190
with amazing power.

274
00:23:55,240 --> 00:23:56,800
But you're ignoring me and

275
00:23:56,800 --> 00:23:58,480
only care about your Mr. Zhuo.

276
00:23:59,040 --> 00:24:00,140
Kid.

277
00:24:00,730 --> 00:24:01,920
If you broaden your horizons,

278
00:24:01,920 --> 00:24:02,960
you'll find

279
00:24:03,260 --> 00:24:04,760
someone better and stronger

280
00:24:04,760 --> 00:24:06,600
to be your role model.

281
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:07,900
For example...

282
00:24:07,900 --> 00:24:08,720
Sister Pei.

283
00:24:15,060 --> 00:24:16,070
She's weaker.

284
00:24:21,990 --> 00:24:23,200
Quit wasting my time.

285
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:24,860
I need to replenish the herbs.

286
00:24:25,020 --> 00:24:25,780
What are you doing?

287
00:24:25,780 --> 00:24:27,860
Don't you think I'm weak?

288
00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:30,000
I can use my power to

289
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:31,930
make your medicine box really big.

290
00:24:32,030 --> 00:24:33,880
Then you can put all the medicine

291
00:24:33,880 --> 00:24:35,290
inside in the future.

292
00:24:35,490 --> 00:24:37,420
You'll never have to worry about not being able

293
00:24:37,420 --> 00:24:38,820
to save him in the future.

294
00:24:39,300 --> 00:24:40,690
You're just bragging.

295
00:24:52,120 --> 00:24:53,070
So big?

296
00:24:56,500 --> 00:24:57,650
Oh my god.

297
00:25:06,820 --> 00:25:08,400
Amazing.

298
00:25:10,060 --> 00:25:11,670
How do I pack it in again?

299
00:25:11,700 --> 00:25:13,220
It can't always be this big, right?

300
00:25:13,220 --> 00:25:15,050
See that bell up there?

301
00:25:15,410 --> 00:25:16,300
Ring it.

302
00:25:18,390 --> 00:25:19,260
Fold.

303
00:25:27,780 --> 00:25:28,680
How is it?

304
00:25:28,770 --> 00:25:30,710
Am I better than Mr. Zhuo now?

305
00:25:31,960 --> 00:25:32,850
Mm...

306
00:25:33,880 --> 00:25:34,940
I have to admit that

307
00:25:35,240 --> 00:25:36,840
you're almost as good as him.

308
00:25:52,470 --> 00:25:53,280
Zhuo.

309
00:25:53,920 --> 00:25:55,160
Listen to me.

310
00:25:55,180 --> 00:25:55,720
Don't...

311
00:25:55,720 --> 00:25:57,980
Don't show off if you're not good enough.

312
00:26:03,130 --> 00:26:04,470
Ignore him.

313
00:26:04,500 --> 00:26:06,120
What I want to say is,

314
00:26:06,620 --> 00:26:09,210
don't ignore the right actions at the right time.

315
00:26:09,210 --> 00:26:10,880
If you can't beat them, outrun them.

316
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:12,810
No need to force yourself to fight.

317
00:26:15,940 --> 00:26:18,460
Ms. Wen Xiao and I share the same view.

318
00:26:23,700 --> 00:26:24,790
Zhu Yan.

319
00:26:24,970 --> 00:26:26,570
What a good name.

320
00:26:27,110 --> 00:26:28,260
Let me guess.

321
00:26:29,030 --> 00:26:31,290
The "Yan" stands for "annoying," right?

322
00:26:34,140 --> 00:26:35,510
Mr. Zhuo.

323
00:26:35,530 --> 00:26:36,670
Your Bingyi Clan

324
00:26:36,910 --> 00:26:39,770
has a secret technique to coagulate water into ice.

325
00:26:39,890 --> 00:26:42,440
It's better than drawing your blood in battle.

326
00:26:42,440 --> 00:26:43,970
I don't know how to use that.

327
00:26:45,180 --> 00:26:47,030
You don't know?

328
00:26:48,570 --> 00:26:50,040
Do you?

329
00:26:50,070 --> 00:26:50,880
Of course.

330
00:26:52,440 --> 00:26:54,640
It's written in so many books.

331
00:26:54,850 --> 00:26:56,190
"The great demon Zhu Yan

332
00:26:56,560 --> 00:26:58,260
is skilled in thousands of divine magic

333
00:26:58,260 --> 00:27:00,060
and all kinds of demonic magic."

334
00:27:00,680 --> 00:27:03,500
Ms. Wen Xiao, your name is also nice.

335
00:27:03,710 --> 00:27:04,950
Let me guess.

336
00:27:04,980 --> 00:27:06,980
Does "Wen" stand for "illiterate"?

337
00:27:14,020 --> 00:27:15,300
Mr. Zhuo.

338
00:27:16,010 --> 00:27:17,100
I can teach you.

339
00:27:17,170 --> 00:27:18,230
It's not hard.

340
00:27:18,590 --> 00:27:20,100
If there is water,

341
00:27:20,140 --> 00:27:22,130
you can use your senses

342
00:27:22,170 --> 00:27:23,750
to control them.

343
00:27:24,840 --> 00:27:25,760
Teach me if you want.

344
00:27:25,760 --> 00:27:26,640
Cut the crap.

345
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:29,250
Come closer then.

346
00:27:30,850 --> 00:27:31,690
Why?

347
00:27:32,250 --> 00:27:33,520
The Bingyi secret technique

348
00:27:33,520 --> 00:27:35,250
cannot be heard by outsiders.

349
00:27:35,900 --> 00:27:36,570
Oh.

350
00:27:37,710 --> 00:27:38,770
Outsider, you say?

351
00:27:41,390 --> 00:27:42,880
Then I, the outsider,

352
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:43,990
shall take my leave.

353
00:27:43,990 --> 00:27:44,870
No need.

354
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:48,920
This is a secret technique only descendants of the Bingyi Clan can use.

355
00:27:48,920 --> 00:27:50,890
Even if you learn about it, it's useless.

356
00:27:50,890 --> 00:27:52,450
Then why did you say that?

357
00:27:52,470 --> 00:27:53,800
You're playing tricks.

358
00:27:54,020 --> 00:27:55,280
Hurry up and come here.

359
00:27:55,810 --> 00:27:56,610
Okay.

360
00:28:05,400 --> 00:28:06,590
Miss Outsider,

361
00:28:07,840 --> 00:28:08,920
please make way.

362
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:09,930
Okay.

363
00:28:30,060 --> 00:28:32,060
The strength comes from the senses.

364
00:28:32,550 --> 00:28:34,280
The form comes from the spirit.

365
00:28:34,760 --> 00:28:36,200
Channel your energy along

366
00:28:36,200 --> 00:28:38,760
the path that I've drawn out for you.

367
00:28:49,630 --> 00:28:51,680
The mind is endless,

368
00:28:51,710 --> 00:28:53,440
the flowing water is tireless.

369
00:29:03,240 --> 00:29:04,890
Aren't you ungrateful?

370
00:29:07,240 --> 00:29:08,480
The tea is so cold.

371
00:29:09,080 --> 00:29:10,690
It's as cold as my heart.

372
00:29:11,300 --> 00:29:12,640
Isn't that nice?

373
00:29:12,850 --> 00:29:13,940
Drink some herbal tea

374
00:29:13,940 --> 00:29:15,150
and calm down.

375
00:29:17,790 --> 00:29:19,830
Mr. Zhuo, you learn fast.

376
00:29:20,850 --> 00:29:22,710
But it'll take a lot of practicing

377
00:29:23,420 --> 00:29:25,290
for you to be able to hit me.

378
00:29:28,290 --> 00:29:29,720
Mr. Zhuo.

379
00:29:30,090 --> 00:29:31,750
Take care of yourself.

380
00:29:39,570 --> 00:29:41,230
Are you really hurt?

381
00:29:41,470 --> 00:29:42,280
Get up.

382
00:29:42,280 --> 00:29:43,420
Don't make trouble.

383
00:29:43,900 --> 00:29:45,830
I'll stay here to take care of Zhuo.

384
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:46,920
Go back first.

385
00:29:46,940 --> 00:29:49,080
Don't delay Mr. Zhuo's recovery.

386
00:29:49,370 --> 00:29:50,580
No way.

387
00:29:50,820 --> 00:29:52,480
I have to stay and protect you.

388
00:29:52,780 --> 00:29:54,560
If Li Lun comes,

389
00:29:54,590 --> 00:29:56,590
Mr. Zhuo can't deal with him.

390
00:29:57,600 --> 00:29:58,760
Li Lun?

391
00:30:02,550 --> 00:30:03,560
Who is Li Lun?

392
00:30:15,140 --> 00:30:16,730
Given what you said,

393
00:30:17,260 --> 00:30:19,310
Li Lun is here for you.

394
00:30:19,900 --> 00:30:21,540
Are you familiar with Li Lun?

395
00:30:22,210 --> 00:30:23,020
Yes.

396
00:30:23,800 --> 00:30:26,130
We have known each other since childhood.

397
00:30:26,600 --> 00:30:28,100
What kind of demon is he?

398
00:30:28,270 --> 00:30:30,670
Why can he possess others?

399
00:30:31,250 --> 00:30:32,450
Li Lun is a tree demon.

400
00:30:32,980 --> 00:30:36,050
His true form is an ancient pagoda tree that likes Yin energy.

401
00:30:36,050 --> 00:30:38,850
His spirit can be held in a single pagoda tree leaf.

402
00:30:38,900 --> 00:30:40,360
Once the leaf lands on a body,

403
00:30:40,360 --> 00:30:41,740
his spirit will possess it,

404
00:30:41,740 --> 00:30:43,860
thereby parasitizing other living beings

405
00:30:43,860 --> 00:30:45,730
and controlling their behaviors.

406
00:30:45,730 --> 00:30:46,930
Is he looking for you?

407
00:30:48,160 --> 00:30:48,760
Yes.

408
00:30:49,930 --> 00:30:51,130
You're avoiding him?

409
00:30:52,480 --> 00:30:54,340
He did many evil things back then.

410
00:30:54,560 --> 00:30:55,880
To uphold justice and punish the evil,

411
00:30:55,880 --> 00:30:57,080
I taught him a lesson.

412
00:30:57,190 --> 00:30:58,630
He's very petty about it

413
00:30:58,700 --> 00:31:00,430
and wants to kill me as revenge.

414
00:31:00,680 --> 00:31:01,810
That's why

415
00:31:01,930 --> 00:31:04,300
I chose to cooperate with the Demon Hunting Bureau

416
00:31:04,300 --> 00:31:06,370
and asked you to deal with him for me.

417
00:31:06,710 --> 00:31:09,590
But I didn't expect you guys to be so weak.

418
00:31:17,290 --> 00:31:19,620
Do you know that there is a formation here?

419
00:31:22,820 --> 00:31:25,510
If someone lies here,

420
00:31:25,920 --> 00:31:27,720
they'll grow a fox tail.

421
00:31:34,840 --> 00:31:35,600
I'm tired.

422
00:31:37,070 --> 00:31:37,870
Commander Zhuo.

423
00:31:37,870 --> 00:31:39,090
Something bad happened in Tiandu.

424
00:31:39,090 --> 00:31:40,840
General Wu Yan of Chongwu Camp

425
00:31:41,120 --> 00:31:41,960
was killed.

426
00:31:42,090 --> 00:31:42,890
What?

427
00:31:49,680 --> 00:31:51,470
Zhuo, get some rest.

428
00:31:51,730 --> 00:31:52,870
Don't worry.

429
00:31:54,820 --> 00:31:55,840
Zhao Yuanzhou.

430
00:31:56,040 --> 00:31:56,840
Come with me.

431
00:31:59,960 --> 00:32:00,870
Wen Xiao.

432
00:32:32,400 --> 00:32:33,290
Sir.

433
00:32:33,320 --> 00:32:34,710
Wu Yan is dead.

434
00:32:35,100 --> 00:32:37,270
Will King Xiang hold us accountable?

435
00:32:37,700 --> 00:32:39,970
General was not killed by a demon

436
00:32:40,080 --> 00:32:42,040
but by the Demon Hunting Bureau's members.

437
00:32:42,040 --> 00:32:42,840
Understand?

438
00:32:43,080 --> 00:32:43,770
Yes.

439
00:32:45,420 --> 00:32:47,560
Wu Yan was killed by a demon.

440
00:32:47,770 --> 00:32:49,700
Why are they blaming the Demon Hunting Bureau now?

441
00:32:49,700 --> 00:32:50,610
Chongwu Camp

442
00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:52,220
exaggerated and twisted the truth,

443
00:32:52,220 --> 00:32:54,530
slandering us before King Xiang.

444
00:32:54,560 --> 00:32:56,700
Fortunately, the Prime Minister pleaded

445
00:32:56,700 --> 00:32:58,110
for us and got us

446
00:32:58,130 --> 00:32:59,490
one last day of pardon.

447
00:33:00,520 --> 00:33:01,880
One last day?

448
00:33:01,910 --> 00:33:04,240
So our five days of pardon became one?

449
00:33:04,530 --> 00:33:06,190
Tomorrow's our death day?

450
00:33:06,220 --> 00:33:07,890
King Xiang ordered for the five of you

451
00:33:07,890 --> 00:33:09,480
to catch the Water Ghost

452
00:33:09,500 --> 00:33:10,760
before noon tomorrow.

453
00:33:11,190 --> 00:33:12,520
Otherwise,

454
00:33:12,560 --> 00:33:14,680
the entire Demon Hunting Bureau

455
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:16,810
will be punished together.

456
00:33:21,650 --> 00:33:23,490
There's only one day left.

457
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:28,400
Then we can't wait until the Water Ghost's marriage

458
00:33:28,400 --> 00:33:30,080
for Ran Yi to show up.

459
00:33:30,110 --> 00:33:31,750
We must take the initiative.

460
00:33:31,810 --> 00:33:33,220
We'll catch him today.

461
00:33:33,410 --> 00:33:34,690
How?

462
00:33:34,930 --> 00:33:36,550
The clues are all gone.

463
00:33:36,680 --> 00:33:37,480
No.

464
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:40,600
There's one last person.

465
00:33:40,860 --> 00:33:43,110
A person who has been hiding in the dark,

466
00:33:44,150 --> 00:33:45,950
but remains crucial to the case.

467
00:33:47,700 --> 00:33:48,870
Miss Qi.

468
00:33:49,840 --> 00:33:51,280
The Water Ghost Marriage Case

469
00:33:51,280 --> 00:33:53,200
involves dozens of victims.

470
00:33:53,610 --> 00:33:55,640
But besides Miss Qi,

471
00:33:55,800 --> 00:33:56,840
other brides

472
00:33:56,860 --> 00:33:59,120
didn't receive Ran Yi's wedding letter.

473
00:33:59,550 --> 00:34:01,340
I believe she must be

474
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:03,410
hiding a big secret.

475
00:34:07,480 --> 00:34:08,880
Miss Qi has gone missing.

476
00:34:11,470 --> 00:34:12,660
My Lady?

477
00:34:16,620 --> 00:34:17,930
What should we do now?

478
00:34:18,200 --> 00:34:19,860
The only clue is gone.

479
00:34:23,490 --> 00:34:25,220
There's another clue.

480
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:29,930
Master Qi.

481
00:34:31,620 --> 00:34:32,280
Master Qi

482
00:34:32,280 --> 00:34:35,410
purposely leaked the information about the demon hunter to us

483
00:34:35,410 --> 00:34:37,650
and asked Commander Zhuo and me to investigate.

484
00:34:37,650 --> 00:34:39,050
We were then ambushed.

485
00:34:39,100 --> 00:34:40,550
He is indeed suspicious.

486
00:34:41,219 --> 00:34:43,090
Go to Qi's Mansion

487
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:45,219
and investigate Master Qi.

488
00:34:45,239 --> 00:34:47,460
I'll use my demon power to track Miss Qi.

489
00:34:47,989 --> 00:34:49,570
Maybe I can find her.

490
00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:51,520
Okay.

491
00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:53,199
Let's split up.

492
00:35:28,570 --> 00:35:29,880
Why are you here alone?

493
00:35:31,130 --> 00:35:31,930
Where is she?

494
00:35:32,370 --> 00:35:33,970
Miss Qi is missing.

495
00:35:35,600 --> 00:35:36,730
Isn't she here?

496
00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:39,770
She's missing?

497
00:35:54,020 --> 00:35:55,640
When I came here last time,

498
00:35:55,980 --> 00:35:58,360
this island wasn't in the middle of the lake.

499
00:35:58,360 --> 00:36:00,850
It must have been hidden by a barrier.

500
00:36:02,050 --> 00:36:04,350
But even a great demon like Zhao Yuanzhou

501
00:36:05,150 --> 00:36:06,760
didn't notice it.

502
00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:10,300
Because he colluded with Ran Yi long ago.

503
00:36:11,710 --> 00:36:12,940
Mr. Zhuo.

504
00:36:13,510 --> 00:36:15,310
Take care.

505
00:36:27,880 --> 00:36:30,540
Fortunately, Ms. Pei's demonic energy-tracking skill

506
00:36:30,540 --> 00:36:32,000
brought us here.

507
00:36:37,430 --> 00:36:38,820
I'm being followed.

508
00:36:39,380 --> 00:36:40,400
So annoying.

509
00:36:41,820 --> 00:36:43,330
With Ms. Pei here,

510
00:36:43,480 --> 00:36:46,140
our Demon Hunting Bureau became very powerful.

511
00:36:46,140 --> 00:36:47,050
How nice.

512
00:36:51,390 --> 00:36:52,910
After this case is closed,

513
00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:55,980
I will quit the Demon Hunting Bureau.

514
00:36:56,160 --> 00:36:57,200
Why?

515
00:36:58,060 --> 00:37:00,790
I don't want to get involved with demons anymore.

516
00:37:00,960 --> 00:37:03,110
Zhao Yuanzhou used my brother as the reason

517
00:37:03,110 --> 00:37:04,440
and got me involved.

518
00:37:05,780 --> 00:37:07,840
But I never trusted him.

519
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:10,160
I went to the Demon Hunting Bureau

520
00:37:10,160 --> 00:37:11,820
to return the token.

521
00:37:12,930 --> 00:37:15,740
But I signed the Military Order

522
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:18,360
under the provocation of Chongwu Camp.

523
00:37:19,290 --> 00:37:21,200
Now he colluded with Ran Yi.

524
00:37:21,430 --> 00:37:22,490
We can't trust him.

525
00:37:26,190 --> 00:37:28,320
Zhu Yan cannot be controlled.

526
00:37:29,600 --> 00:37:32,200
I think you know that better than I do, Mr. Zhuo.

527
00:37:33,970 --> 00:37:35,850
I hope you can cut your losses

528
00:37:36,670 --> 00:37:38,670
and stop trusting the wrong people.

529
00:37:40,490 --> 00:37:42,170
Since you didn't invite them,

530
00:37:43,170 --> 00:37:45,330
don't blame me for being rude.

531
00:38:09,650 --> 00:38:10,400
Be careful!

532
00:38:35,570 --> 00:38:36,370
Wen Xiao?

533
00:38:38,560 --> 00:38:39,400
Mr. Zhuo?

534
00:39:01,880 --> 00:39:02,850
Wen Xiao?

535
00:39:04,640 --> 00:39:05,680
Mr. Zhuo?

536
00:39:30,610 --> 00:39:32,490
Those who are as firm as a rock

537
00:39:33,240 --> 00:39:35,120
will also break down in despair.

538
00:39:37,770 --> 00:39:40,370
Hurry up and release your dream control magic.

539
00:39:41,570 --> 00:39:43,630
Once the Dream Control Magic is used,

540
00:39:43,960 --> 00:39:45,200
no one can release it.

541
00:39:46,440 --> 00:39:47,920
The dreamers must

542
00:39:47,920 --> 00:39:50,040
realize that they are dreaming

543
00:39:50,640 --> 00:39:52,500
to escape the dreams themselves.

544
00:39:53,360 --> 00:39:54,380
Otherwise,

545
00:39:54,530 --> 00:39:57,190
they will be trapped in this nightmare forever.

546
00:39:59,610 --> 00:40:00,410
Besides,

547
00:40:01,820 --> 00:40:03,700
didn't you ask me to do this?

548
00:40:38,520 --> 00:40:39,910
Interesting.

549
00:40:40,690 --> 00:40:41,720
How are you resisting

550
00:40:41,720 --> 00:40:43,370
my dream control magic?

551
00:40:46,770 --> 00:40:48,100
It's him.

552
00:41:00,590 --> 00:41:01,880
It's really him.

553
00:41:51,730 --> 00:41:53,120
Go find her.
