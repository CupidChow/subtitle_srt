00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,600
Ah...

2
00:00:04,120 --> 00:00:06,320
Now I can write it down again!

3
00:00:11,660 --> 00:00:15,040
Place a reenact music for your youtube soon time!

4
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:20,040
I'm sorry, but I'm not sure if I can get the key to the room.

5
00:00:20,040 --> 00:00:25,040
I'm sorry, but I'm not sure if I can get the key to the room.

00:00:50,040 --> 00:00:55,040
I'm sorry, but I'm not sure if I can get the key to the room.

00:00:55,040 --> 00:01:00,040
I'm sorry, but I'm not sure if I can get the key to the room.

00:01:00,040 --> 00:01:05,040
I'm sorry, but I'm not sure if I can get the key to the room.

00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:10,040
I'm sorry, but I'm not sure if I can get the key to the room.

00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:15,040
I'm sorry, but I'm not sure if I can get the key to the room.

00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:20,040
I'm sorry, but I'm not sure if I can get the key to the room.

00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:25,040
I'm sorry, but I'm not sure if I can get the key to the room.

00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:30,040
I'm sorry, but I'm not sure if I can get the key to the room.

19
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:35,040
I'm sorry, but I'm not sure if I can get the key to the room.

00:01:55,540 --> 00:01:58,040
Dad.

21
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:02,040
I have to go.

22
00:02:02,740 --> 00:02:04,740
I'll be back.

23
00:02:04,740 --> 00:02:06,740
I'm sorry.

24
00:02:06,740 --> 00:02:08,740

42
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:46,440
Dad.

43
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:48,440

Dad.

80
00:04:30,540 --> 00:04:32,700
Dad.

81
00:04:32,700 --> 00:04:34,700

Dad.

85
00:04:44,540 --> 00:04:47,540
Dad.

86
00:04:47,540 --> 00:04:49,540
Dad.

87
00:04:49,540 --> 00:04:51,940
Dad.

88
00:04:51,940 --> 00:04:53,940
Dad,

89
00:04:53,940 --> 00:04:58,900
Escaped, I hate myself this much!

90
00:05:12,460 --> 00:05:14,760
See? You can't help but chill around, huh?

91
00:05:16,220 --> 00:05:19,040
This kind of shame just stays the same...

92
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:27,420
See you tomorrow

93
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:43,180
Let me have it

94
00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:51,100
Chuo

95
00:05:53,940 --> 00:06:09,300
Hold on!

96
00:06:09,300 --> 00:06:16,300
The first time I saw a monster that was so powerful that I thought it was a monster that could be used by a monster.

97
00:06:16,300 --> 00:06:26,300
The first time I saw a monster that was so powerful that I thought it was a monster that could be used by a monster.

98
00:06:26,300 --> 00:06:36,300
The first time I saw a monster that was so powerful that I thought it was a monster that could be used by a monster.

99
00:06:36,300 --> 00:06:46,300
The first time I saw a monster that was so powerful that I thought it was a monster that could be used by a monster.

100
00:06:46,300 --> 00:06:56,300
The first time I saw a monster that was so powerful that I thought it was a monster that could be used by a monster.

101
00:06:57,300 --> 00:07:02,300
Netsuko

102
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:11,300
Netsuko

103
00:07:11,300 --> 00:07:16,300
Richard

104
00:07:16,300 --> 00:07:22,300
Not a single word

105
00:07:22,300 --> 00:07:22,780
have 문개

106
00:07:47,340 --> 00:07:47,580
tempe

107
00:07:52,300 --> 00:07:54,300
Let go of him!

108
00:07:58,300 --> 00:08:00,300
Xiaojiao!

109
00:08:17,300 --> 00:08:18,300
Xiaojiao.

110
00:08:18,300 --> 00:08:20,300
Xiaojiao.

111
00:08:21,300 --> 00:08:23,300
Xiaojiao.

112
00:08:33,300 --> 00:08:35,300
Have you ever had nightmares?

113
00:08:36,300 --> 00:08:38,300
Dreams are

114
00:08:39,300 --> 00:08:41,300
the things you think will end.

115
00:08:42,300 --> 00:08:45,300
Actually, it just started.

116
00:08:49,300 --> 00:08:54,300
Wenxiao and Pei Sijing are dead.

117
00:08:56,300 --> 00:08:57,300
I don't believe it.

118
00:08:58,300 --> 00:09:00,300
If you don't believe it, you can look back.

119
00:09:01,300 --> 00:09:02,300
Impossible.

120
00:09:04,300 --> 00:09:05,300
Impossible.

121
00:09:18,300 --> 00:09:20,300
I'm sorry.

122
00:09:21,300 --> 00:09:22,300
I'm sorry.

123
00:09:23,300 --> 00:09:24,300
I'm sorry.

124
00:09:25,300 --> 00:09:26,300
I'm sorry.

125
00:09:27,300 --> 00:09:28,300
I'm sorry.

126
00:09:29,300 --> 00:09:30,300
I'm sorry.

127
00:09:31,300 --> 00:09:32,300
I'm sorry.

128
00:09:33,300 --> 00:09:34,300
I'm sorry.

129
00:09:35,300 --> 00:09:36,300
I'm sorry.

130
00:09:37,300 --> 00:09:38,300
I'm sorry.

131
00:09:39,300 --> 00:09:40,300
I'm sorry.

132
00:09:41,300 --> 00:09:42,300
I'm sorry.

133
00:09:43,300 --> 00:09:44,300
I'm sorry.

134
00:09:45,300 --> 00:09:46,300
I'm sorry.

135
00:09:46,300 --> 00:09:47,300
I'm sorry.

136
00:10:12,300 --> 00:10:14,300
Now, you're the only one left.

137
00:10:15,300 --> 00:10:16,300
Are you lonely?

138
00:10:18,300 --> 00:10:19,300
Are you afraid?

139
00:10:30,300 --> 00:10:31,300
Xiaojiao, don't worry.

140
00:10:32,300 --> 00:10:34,300
As long as you need me, I'll find you.

141
00:10:35,300 --> 00:10:37,300
I'll always be with Linda.

142
00:10:38,300 --> 00:10:40,300
You can find her anytime.

143
00:10:44,300 --> 00:10:46,300
I'll always be with Linda.

144
00:10:47,300 --> 00:10:49,300
I'll always be with Linda.

145
00:10:50,300 --> 00:10:52,300
I'll always be with Linda.

146
00:10:53,300 --> 00:10:55,300
I'll always be with Linda.

147
00:10:56,300 --> 00:10:58,300
I'll always be with Linda.

148
00:10:59,300 --> 00:11:01,300
I'll always be with Linda.

149
00:11:02,300 --> 00:11:04,300
I'll always be with Linda.

150
00:11:05,300 --> 00:11:07,300
I'll always be with Linda.

151
00:11:08,300 --> 00:11:10,300
I'll always be with Linda.

152
00:11:11,300 --> 00:11:13,300
I'll always be with Linda.

153
00:11:14,300 --> 00:11:15,300
No.

154
00:11:18,300 --> 00:11:19,300
This is Jia.

155
00:11:23,300 --> 00:11:24,300
She didn't have Linda.

156
00:11:30,300 --> 00:11:31,300
So,

157
00:11:33,300 --> 00:11:35,300
these are all dreams.

158
00:11:39,300 --> 00:11:42,300
I killed myself.

159
00:11:45,300 --> 00:11:47,300
Wang Jia woke up.

160
00:12:07,300 --> 00:12:09,300
Zhu Yijian, wake up.

161
00:12:15,300 --> 00:12:16,300
Zhu Yijian,

162
00:12:17,300 --> 00:12:18,300
I think there's something wrong.

163
00:12:22,300 --> 00:12:24,300
Zhu Yijian, wake up.

164
00:12:25,300 --> 00:12:27,300
Zhu Yijian, wake up.

165
00:12:28,300 --> 00:12:29,300
It's useless.

166
00:12:30,300 --> 00:12:32,300
I can't wake up from this nightmare.

167
00:12:33,300 --> 00:12:35,300
And she and Ran Yi's dream is different.

168
00:12:36,300 --> 00:12:38,300
If she dies in her dream,

169
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:41,300
she will die in real life.

170
00:12:45,300 --> 00:12:47,300
Xia Chuo, Zhu Yijian.

171
00:12:54,300 --> 00:12:56,300
Let me see you off for the last time.

172
00:13:15,300 --> 00:13:17,300
I'll always be with Linda.

173
00:13:18,300 --> 00:13:20,300
I'll always be with Linda.

174
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:23,300
I'll always be with Linda.

175
00:13:24,300 --> 00:13:26,300
I'll always be with Linda.

176
00:13:27,300 --> 00:13:29,300
I'll always be with Linda.

177
00:13:30,300 --> 00:13:32,300
I'll always be with Linda.

178
00:13:33,300 --> 00:13:35,300
I'll always be with Linda.

179
00:13:36,300 --> 00:13:38,300
I'll always be with Linda.

180
00:13:39,300 --> 00:13:41,300
I'll always be with Linda.

181
00:13:41,300 --> 00:13:43,300
I'll always be with Linda.

182
00:14:11,300 --> 00:14:13,300
I'll always be with Linda.

183
00:14:19,300 --> 00:14:22,300
I've been practicing for a hundred years.

184
00:14:23,300 --> 00:14:25,300
I can make you wake up again.

185
00:14:27,300 --> 00:14:29,300
You're the most powerful demon now.

186
00:14:31,300 --> 00:14:33,300
You can only talk to me.

187
00:14:34,300 --> 00:14:35,300
After the song,

188
00:14:38,300 --> 00:14:40,300
you'll be dead.

189
00:14:41,300 --> 00:14:46,300
How can you let me go?

190
00:14:47,300 --> 00:14:49,300
The mountain is so far away.

191
00:14:50,300 --> 00:14:53,300
The flowers are all gone.

192
00:14:53,300 --> 00:14:55,300
The water is so cold.

193
00:14:56,300 --> 00:14:59,300
Let the bitter rain stop.

194
00:15:00,300 --> 00:15:02,300
I know you want to break the spell.

195
00:15:02,300 --> 00:15:03,300
You'll be dead.

196
00:15:04,300 --> 00:15:07,300
I'll always be with Linda.

197
00:15:07,300 --> 00:15:10,300
I'll always be with Linda.

198
00:15:11,300 --> 00:15:14,300
I'm here to help you.

199
00:15:41,300 --> 00:15:41,400

202
00:15:53,060 --> 00:15:54,460
Episode 23

203
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:09,820
Anyone else?

204
00:16:09,820 --> 00:16:11,200
In front of me?

205
00:16:11,300 --> 00:16:13,300
He's really good.

206
00:16:14,740 --> 00:16:17,540
But he can only be a part of the party.

207
00:16:18,500 --> 00:16:21,300
He can't get rid of the dream of Chen Ni.

208
00:16:25,020 --> 00:16:26,620
Why is that?

209
00:16:28,900 --> 00:16:32,900
Because this dream of Chen Ni is not magic.

210
00:16:33,580 --> 00:16:34,900
It's poison.

211
00:16:41,900 --> 00:16:43,900
I'll get them at your Slab.

212
00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:47,660
Eh.

213
00:16:51,660 --> 00:16:52,420
By poison?

214
00:16:58,660 --> 00:16:59,980
Damn it, Mr. underground.

215
00:17:05,580 --> 00:17:08,180
Lord Xiaochuo, it could do, right?

216
00:17:08,900 --> 00:17:10,800
I can try, but it takes sometime.

217
00:17:11,300 --> 00:17:16,300
I'll give you some time to keep your old friend safe.

218
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:28,300
Jingang, you've always been regretting it.

219
00:17:29,800 --> 00:17:32,300
You didn't have the chance to tell Fei...

220
00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:35,800
...that you're upset.

221
00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:39,800
He's not Fei.

222
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:42,800
Are you sure?

223
00:18:05,800 --> 00:18:07,800
I'm not Fei.

224
00:18:07,800 --> 00:18:09,800
I'm not Fei.

225
00:18:09,800 --> 00:18:11,800
I'm not Fei.

226
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:13,800
I'm not Fei.

227
00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:15,800
I'm not Fei.

228
00:18:15,800 --> 00:18:17,800
I'm not Fei.

229
00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:19,800
I'm not Fei.

230
00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:21,800
I'm not Fei.

231
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:23,800
I'm not Fei.

232
00:18:23,800 --> 00:18:25,800
I'm not Fei.

233
00:18:25,800 --> 00:18:27,800
I'm not Fei.

234
00:18:27,800 --> 00:18:29,800
I'm not Fei.

235
00:18:29,800 --> 00:18:31,800
I'm not Fei.

236
00:18:31,800 --> 00:18:33,800
I'm not Fei.

237
00:18:33,800 --> 00:18:35,800
I'm not Fei.

238
00:19:03,800 --> 00:19:05,800
No one can stop him.

239
00:19:08,800 --> 00:19:10,800
No one can stop him.

240
00:19:14,800 --> 00:19:16,800
He's going to be killed.

241
00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:21,800
No one can stop him.

242
00:19:21,800 --> 00:19:23,800
He's going to be killed.

243
00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:31,800
Can you stand up, Mr. Pei?

244
00:19:33,800 --> 00:19:35,800
No one can stop him.

245
00:19:49,800 --> 00:19:51,800
No one can stop him.

246
00:19:51,800 --> 00:19:54,800
I don't want to stand up.

247
00:19:57,800 --> 00:20:00,800
I'm going to be killed.

248
00:20:03,800 --> 00:20:05,800
I'm going to be killed.

249
00:20:05,800 --> 00:20:07,800
I'm going to be killed.

250
00:20:07,800 --> 00:20:09,800
I'm going to be killed.

251
00:20:09,800 --> 00:20:11,800
I'm going to be killed.

252
00:20:11,800 --> 00:20:13,800
I'm going to be killed.

253
00:20:21,800 --> 00:20:23,800
Yilan.

254
00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:26,800
You wanted Zhao Yuanzhou to die.

255
00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:29,800
Now you're trying to help me.

256
00:20:31,800 --> 00:20:32,800
Yilan.

257
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:36,800
Zhao Yuanzhou.

258
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:38,800
You're a demon.

259
00:20:38,800 --> 00:20:41,800
You have the strongest power in the world.

260
00:20:41,800 --> 00:20:45,800
But you lost your spirit to a mortal.

261
00:20:45,800 --> 00:20:47,800
You're a demon.

262
00:20:47,800 --> 00:20:49,800
You're a demon.

263
00:20:49,800 --> 00:20:51,800
You're the most famous demon in the world.

264
00:20:51,800 --> 00:20:53,800
You're such a fool.

265
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:06,800
Qinggeng.

266
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:09,800
You love each other.

267
00:21:09,800 --> 00:21:12,800
Now you want to take the lead.

268
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:18,800
That's why I said that you're a demon.

269
00:21:18,800 --> 00:21:21,800
You're a fool.

270
00:21:21,800 --> 00:21:23,800
You don't understand.

271
00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:27,800
It's because you only have eyes to heal the power and virtue of this world.

272
00:21:27,800 --> 00:21:30,800
But you never use your heart to change it.

273
00:21:30,800 --> 00:21:33,800
You never use your heart to feel it.

274
00:21:49,800 --> 00:21:51,800
You're not him.

275
00:21:53,800 --> 00:21:55,800
You're not him.

276
00:21:55,800 --> 00:21:58,800
You're not him.

277
00:22:25,800 --> 00:22:27,800
You're not him.

278
00:22:27,800 --> 00:22:29,800
You're not him.

279
00:22:29,800 --> 00:22:31,800
You're not him.

280
00:22:31,800 --> 00:22:33,800
You're not him.

281
00:22:33,800 --> 00:22:35,800
You're not him.

282
00:22:35,800 --> 00:22:37,800
You're not him.

283
00:22:37,800 --> 00:22:39,800
You're not him.

284
00:22:39,800 --> 00:22:41,800
You're not him.

285
00:22:55,800 --> 00:23:01,800
But I hope that you're him.

286
00:23:25,800 --> 00:23:27,800
I'm not him.

287
00:23:27,800 --> 00:23:29,800
You're not him.

288
00:23:29,800 --> 00:23:31,800
You're not him.

289
00:23:31,800 --> 00:23:33,800
You're not him.

290
00:23:33,800 --> 00:23:35,800
You're not him.

291
00:23:35,800 --> 00:23:37,800
You're not him.

292
00:23:37,800 --> 00:23:39,800
You're not him.

293
00:23:39,800 --> 00:23:41,800
You're not him.

294
00:23:41,800 --> 00:23:43,800
You're not him.

295
00:23:43,800 --> 00:23:45,800
You're not him.

296
00:23:45,800 --> 00:23:47,800
You're not him.

297
00:23:47,800 --> 00:23:49,800
You're not him.

298
00:23:49,800 --> 00:23:51,800
You're not him.

299
00:23:51,800 --> 00:23:53,800
You're not him.

300
00:23:53,800 --> 00:23:55,800
You're not him.

301
00:24:53,800 --> 00:24:56,800
It's real, you're wrong.

302
00:24:59,800 --> 00:25:02,800
He was alive in the evening but she didn't live long.

303
00:25:02,800 --> 00:25:05,800
People said he was a little girl.

304
00:25:07,400 --> 00:25:09,400
I don't understand.

305
00:25:09,800 --> 00:25:10,800
He's dead.

306
00:25:10,800 --> 00:25:12,600
Why did you do that?

307
00:25:14,600 --> 00:25:17,600
No, he can't be alive.

308
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:20,600
Should I make you pay more for the details of his crime?

309
00:25:20,600 --> 00:25:23,600
When he planned across the county?

310
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:48,200
Just he got my recommendation to change it into L nominated by the

311
00:25:48,200 --> 00:25:50,200
If you hold it, you can go to his place of hiding.

312
00:25:50,200 --> 00:25:51,200
Okay.

313
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:54,200
Then hold it well.

314
00:25:54,200 --> 00:25:55,200
Go back to Jiao Si.

315
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:56,200
I promise you.

316
00:25:56,200 --> 00:25:57,200
If you are in danger,

317
00:25:57,200 --> 00:25:59,200
I will take Xiao Zhu back to you immediately.

318
00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:01,200
You go back to Jiao Si.

319
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:02,200

You are awake.

325
00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:51,200
I saw a green light in my dream.

326
00:26:54,200 --> 00:26:56,200
It was the one in Qinggeng.

327
00:26:56,200 --> 00:26:58,200
I am awake.

328
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:08,200
Fortunately, I wake you up.

I can always be with you.

348
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:56,200
I was blinded by you.

349
00:28:56,200 --> 00:28:58,200
I was blinded by you.

350
00:28:58,200 --> 00:29:04,200
Now, let me see what you are.

351
00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:33,200
You destroyed the real Sgye.

352
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:50,200
That is how I draw death from the handial.

353
00:29:50,200 --> 00:29:52,080

00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:56,200
I'm not sure if I can get the key to the door.

376
00:33:56,200 --> 00:34:01,200
I'm going to kill you.

377
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:03,200
You are...

378
00:34:10,200 --> 00:34:14,860
The

379
00:34:16,860 --> 00:34:21,120
crowd

380
00:34:29,060 --> 00:34:35,980
Rad bob

381
00:35:05,980 --> 00:35:06,980
Don't kill him!

382
00:35:06,980 --> 00:35:08,980
If you kill him, you'll kill me!

383
00:35:09,980 --> 00:35:10,980
Xiaoqiu.

384
00:35:13,980 --> 00:35:14,980
Move aside.

385
00:35:14,980 --> 00:35:15,980
Five years later

386
00:35:16,980 --> 00:35:18,300
You're a mortal!

387
00:35:22,180 --> 00:35:23,140
Yi Guang

388
00:35:25,100 --> 00:35:25,660
Can you stop...?

389
00:35:25,660 --> 00:35:26,140
Qi S Ze

390
00:35:26,140 --> 00:35:26,800
Mvie

391
00:35:39,940 --> 00:35:41,740
There's a week for that!

392
00:35:41,740 --> 00:35:43,740
You are a mortal.

393
00:35:44,740 --> 00:35:46,740
It's impossible to defeat me.

394
00:35:47,740 --> 00:35:48,740
No.

395
00:35:49,740 --> 00:35:50,740
In this world,

396
00:35:53,740 --> 00:35:55,740
you are the fear in my heart.

397
00:36:12,740 --> 00:36:14,740
I'm not a mortal.

398
00:36:15,740 --> 00:36:17,740
I'm a mortal.

399
00:36:18,740 --> 00:36:20,740
I'm a mortal.

400
00:36:21,740 --> 00:36:23,740
I'm a mortal.

401
00:36:24,740 --> 00:36:26,740
I'm a mortal.

402
00:36:42,740 --> 00:36:44,740
I'm a mortal.

403
00:36:45,740 --> 00:36:47,740
I'm a mortal.

404
00:36:48,740 --> 00:36:50,740
I'm a mortal.

405
00:36:51,740 --> 00:36:53,740
I'm a mortal.

406
00:36:54,740 --> 00:36:56,740
I'm a mortal.

407
00:36:57,740 --> 00:36:59,740
I'm a mortal.

408
00:37:00,740 --> 00:37:02,740
I'm a mortal.

409
00:37:03,740 --> 00:37:05,740
I'm a mortal.

410
00:37:06,740 --> 00:37:08,740
I'm a mortal.

411
00:37:12,740 --> 00:37:14,740
I'm a mortal.

412
00:37:27,740 --> 00:37:28,740
What do you want?

413
00:37:29,740 --> 00:37:31,740
Do you think you are not enough?

414
00:37:31,740 --> 00:37:33,740
Are you not enough?

415
00:37:57,740 --> 00:37:58,740
All right.

416
00:38:01,740 --> 00:38:03,740
I'll be there when you are free.

417
00:38:04,740 --> 00:38:06,740
I'll be there when you are free.

418
00:38:08,740 --> 00:38:10,740
I'll give you a candy every time you take a bite.

419
00:38:11,740 --> 00:38:14,740
I will give you a candy every time you take a bite.

420
00:38:18,740 --> 00:38:19,740
I...

421
00:38:21,740 --> 00:38:22,740
I really love them.

422
00:38:23,740 --> 00:38:25,740
But it's better not to say anything now.

423
00:38:26,740 --> 00:38:27,740
Even if it's a fateful past,

424
00:38:28,740 --> 00:38:29,740
it's still painful.

425
00:38:29,740 --> 00:38:31,740
It's still painful.

426
00:38:34,340 --> 00:38:35,340
This time,

427
00:38:38,040 --> 00:38:39,040
you finally

428
00:38:40,840 --> 00:38:42,340
don't need to see me again.

429
00:38:59,740 --> 00:39:01,740
He is a dream.

430
00:39:04,040 --> 00:39:07,140
His eyes are not

431
00:39:08,340 --> 00:39:09,340
in the way.

432
00:39:09,540 --> 00:39:11,140
I just want to find

433
00:39:11,540 --> 00:39:14,540
a place to sleep.

434
00:39:17,840 --> 00:39:18,840
Sister Pei.

435
00:39:19,240 --> 00:39:20,240
Sister Pei.

436
00:39:20,740 --> 00:39:21,740
Wake up.

437
00:39:22,740 --> 00:39:23,740
Maybe,

438
00:39:24,540 --> 00:39:25,740
the song of mortal

439
00:39:26,540 --> 00:39:28,740
can't kill Li Yangcao.

440
00:39:30,740 --> 00:39:31,740
But I can

441
00:39:33,240 --> 00:39:35,240
kill my own fear.

442
00:40:00,740 --> 00:40:01,740
The story of the night

443
00:40:01,740 --> 00:40:02,740
is a short story

444
00:40:02,740 --> 00:40:03,740
in the world.

445
00:40:03,740 --> 00:40:04,740
The story of the night

446
00:40:04,740 --> 00:40:06,740
is a short story.

447
00:40:07,740 --> 00:40:08,740
The sad story of life

448
00:40:08,740 --> 00:40:09,740
is a short story.

449
00:40:10,740 --> 00:40:12,740
Love is a little bit sad.

450
00:40:13,740 --> 00:40:14,740
My eyes become a wind.

451
00:40:14,740 --> 00:40:15,740
I want to make a rain.

452
00:40:16,740 --> 00:40:18,740
I will go with you.

453
00:40:19,740 --> 00:40:20,740
From the south to the north,

454
00:40:20,740 --> 00:40:21,740
from the east to the west,

455
00:40:22,740 --> 00:40:24,740
I will be your star.

456
00:40:24,740 --> 00:40:26,740
There is always a world

457
00:40:26,740 --> 00:40:28,740
that can't be known.

458
00:40:28,940 --> 00:40:29,940
Not necessarily so far away.

459
00:40:30,940 --> 00:40:31,940
There is a time,

460
00:40:32,740 --> 00:40:33,740
the world changes.

461
00:40:34,740 --> 00:40:35,740
There is always a world,

462
00:40:36,740 --> 00:40:38,740
no shining sensations,

463
00:40:38,740 --> 00:40:39,740
no wind,

464
00:40:40,740 --> 00:40:42,740
because she сем war.

465
00:40:42,740 --> 00:40:44,440
Scattered coins

466
00:40:44,740 --> 00:40:47,740
made from stone.

467
00:40:49,240 --> 00:40:50,740
The story of the night

468
00:40:51,300 --> 00:40:52,740
is a short story.

469
00:40:52,740 --> 00:40:53,740
Nouck or falcon.

470
00:40:54,740 --> 00:40:56,740
There is always a world,

471
00:40:56,740 --> 00:41:00,740
The only thing that will never change is the future

472
00:41:00,740 --> 00:41:04,740
I will follow the path that I have chosen

473
00:41:04,740 --> 00:41:06,740
I will not give up until I have the courage to do it
