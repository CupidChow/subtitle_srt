[Episode 16]

3
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:53,720
Zhu Yan.

4
00:01:55,710 --> 00:01:56,590
Don't forget.

5
00:01:58,420 --> 00:02:01,509
It was you who led me out of the Wilderness.

6
00:02:04,440 --> 00:02:07,820
Only then did I get to see the vast world.

7
00:02:08,690 --> 00:02:10,760
The mortal world is noisy and bustling.

8
00:02:10,760 --> 00:02:12,090
What's so good about it?

9
00:02:12,540 --> 00:02:13,740
Why must we come here?

10
00:02:15,870 --> 00:02:18,110
And every time I accompany you to the mortal world,

11
00:02:18,110 --> 00:02:19,440
I have to get this stamp.

12
00:02:20,110 --> 00:02:21,100
It's so annoying.

13
00:02:21,100 --> 00:02:21,750
Hey,

14
00:02:21,750 --> 00:02:22,440
look.

15
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:24,160
What's this?

16
00:02:25,910 --> 00:02:29,070
♫The trees and grass of the world sway with the wind♫

17
00:02:26,510 --> 00:02:27,920
It looks really pretty.

18
00:02:29,070 --> 00:02:29,750
Dear customer,

19
00:02:29,130 --> 00:02:32,410
♫Beneath the bodhi tree, dust gathers♫

20
00:02:29,750 --> 00:02:31,070
this is not a hairpin.

21
00:02:34,450 --> 00:02:37,360
♫The good old days are gone for good like that lantern in my dream♫

22
00:02:37,430 --> 00:02:40,900
♫See immortals enter Penglai♫

23
00:02:38,590 --> 00:02:39,520
Let's go back.

24
00:02:39,770 --> 00:02:41,170
What's so fun about this?

25
00:02:41,460 --> 00:02:42,800
This is so much fun!

26
00:02:41,990 --> 00:02:45,450
♫The northern wind blows from beyond the mountains♫

27
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:45,079
You can't find these in the Wilderness.

28
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:46,680
Who cares?

29
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:49,430
♫Along the icy river, it drifts into my dreams♫

30
00:02:47,430 --> 00:02:48,790
Sir, this is a paper windmill.

31
00:02:48,790 --> 00:02:50,390
It spins when the wind blows.

32
00:02:50,550 --> 00:02:53,640
♫Drinking wine at the Tongque Terrace♫

33
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:53,850
-Humans are so smart.
-Human are so incompetent.

34
00:02:54,620 --> 00:02:57,079
♫Even the stars feel close enough to touch♫

35
00:02:57,140 --> 00:03:01,250
♫Life and death happen in an instant, but love and hate can endure for a long time♫

36
00:02:58,980 --> 00:03:00,900
They go to all this trouble to make such things

37
00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:02,120
just to play with the wind.

38
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:04,760
♫Beyond cause and effect♫

39
00:03:02,550 --> 00:03:03,860
In the Wilderness,

40
00:03:04,300 --> 00:03:06,580
most of us demons could do this with just a breath.

41
00:03:05,630 --> 00:03:09,410
♫The heavens endure, the world remains eternal♫

42
00:03:07,030 --> 00:03:08,830
That's why I say they're clever.

43
00:03:09,470 --> 00:03:10,560
Without magical powers,

44
00:03:09,850 --> 00:03:13,670
♫Rock and moss♫

45
00:03:10,670 --> 00:03:12,930
they can still come up with such methods.

46
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:15,250
Why are you always taking their side?

47
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:15,560
♫Are watching♫

48
00:03:15,620 --> 00:03:18,640
♫A lone boat drifts through the vast world, vanishing into mist♫

49
00:03:15,990 --> 00:03:17,150
Why not?

50
00:03:18,690 --> 00:03:21,690
♫Its sound fading away♫

51
00:03:22,930 --> 00:03:23,770
♫I wish♫

52
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:26,970
♫The sorrow of parting stayed beyond the river, and that we did not share the same mountain and moon♫

53
00:03:27,020 --> 00:03:30,840
♫Deep love, yet fate runs shallow♫

54
00:03:46,350 --> 00:03:48,010
Heaven and Earth are divided.

55
00:03:49,470 --> 00:03:51,530
Since they are two different realms,

56
00:03:51,990 --> 00:03:54,720
they must follow their respective natural laws.

57
00:03:55,990 --> 00:03:57,650
Humans are born ignorant,

58
00:03:58,230 --> 00:04:00,090
so they need to learn principles.

59
00:04:00,990 --> 00:04:02,850
Demons are naturally combative,

60
00:04:03,829 --> 00:04:05,490
so they need to be restrained.

61
00:04:06,270 --> 00:04:07,900
Baize Goddess.

62
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:12,110
I'm tired of your

63
00:04:12,550 --> 00:04:14,050
hypocritical words.

64
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:16,580
Subject all things to freedom

65
00:04:16,710 --> 00:04:18,550
and natural selection.

66
00:04:18,790 --> 00:04:20,270
That's the right way.

67
00:04:24,110 --> 00:04:25,029
Li Lun.

68
00:04:25,870 --> 00:04:27,550
Have you ever thought that

69
00:04:27,990 --> 00:04:29,920
once the Wilderness is destroyed,

70
00:04:29,990 --> 00:04:32,070
the lesser demons with weak spiritual energy

71
00:04:32,070 --> 00:04:34,910
won't be able to take human form at all?

72
00:04:34,990 --> 00:04:36,520
Along with the Wilderness,

73
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:39,320
they will be doomed too.

74
00:04:41,300 --> 00:04:43,159
The great path is hard to achieve.

75
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:47,290
Sacrifices are inevitable.

76
00:04:48,460 --> 00:04:50,750
Once the Star Formation collapses,

77
00:04:50,990 --> 00:04:52,390
it will be beyond repair.

78
00:04:53,970 --> 00:04:55,150
Zhao Yuanzhou,

79
00:04:56,700 --> 00:04:58,030
your doomsday has come.

80
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:02,020
I know.

81
00:05:26,430 --> 00:05:27,360
If you don't die,

82
00:05:27,870 --> 00:05:29,680
I can't possibly die before you.

83
00:05:30,510 --> 00:05:31,310
Alright.

84
00:05:32,510 --> 00:05:34,590
Please make sure you keep your word.

85
00:05:34,870 --> 00:05:36,040
Let me die first.

86
00:05:37,830 --> 00:05:38,630
Ying Lei.

87
00:05:39,390 --> 00:05:40,980
I'm counting on you tomorrow.

88
00:05:40,980 --> 00:05:42,580
The future of the Wilderness

89
00:05:42,670 --> 00:05:43,800
is in your hands now.

90
00:05:46,590 --> 00:05:47,990
I will do my best.

91
00:05:48,220 --> 00:05:49,190
But

92
00:05:50,030 --> 00:05:51,430
I still can't believe it.

93
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:56,010
Zhu Yin and my grandpa were close friends for so many years.

94
00:05:56,010 --> 00:05:57,170
Why would he also...

95
00:05:59,090 --> 00:06:00,500
When I first met Zhu Yin,

96
00:06:01,610 --> 00:06:03,250
I saw that his whole body

97
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:06,210
was surrounded by an unrelenting malicious energy.

98
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:10,470
No one knows about malicious energy

99
00:06:10,470 --> 00:06:12,460
better than I do.

100
00:06:16,910 --> 00:06:17,960
Mr. Zhuo.

101
00:06:18,330 --> 00:06:19,530
Ying Lei's safety

102
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:20,690
is in your hands now.

103
00:06:22,010 --> 00:06:23,220
But remember,

104
00:06:23,470 --> 00:06:25,060
don't come too early.

105
00:06:25,780 --> 00:06:27,250
I still want to hear

106
00:06:27,270 --> 00:06:29,330
what they're really up to.

107
00:06:31,650 --> 00:06:33,150
Then how do I judge if it's early

108
00:06:33,150 --> 00:06:33,990
or not?

109
00:06:50,750 --> 00:06:52,020
Wait for my signal.

110
00:07:15,510 --> 00:07:17,160
Ying Lei, go quickly!

111
00:07:17,670 --> 00:07:18,500
Mr. Zhuo,

112
00:07:18,530 --> 00:07:19,790
take care of yourself.

113
00:07:29,790 --> 00:07:30,590
Grandpa!

114
00:07:33,940 --> 00:07:34,780
I'm here!

115
00:07:34,840 --> 00:07:35,750
Form the array.

116
00:07:36,110 --> 00:07:37,590
The stars align

117
00:07:37,700 --> 00:07:39,210
to stabilize the universe.

118
00:07:39,210 --> 00:07:40,120
Protect!

119
00:07:58,950 --> 00:07:59,940
Zhu Yin.

120
00:08:00,450 --> 00:08:01,650
Who said

121
00:08:01,670 --> 00:08:03,790
I could only struggle alone?

122
00:08:04,300 --> 00:08:05,630
Have you forgotten that

123
00:08:05,870 --> 00:08:08,430
I still have a Mountain God here?

124
00:08:38,669 --> 00:08:39,640
Mr. Zhuo,

125
00:08:39,909 --> 00:08:41,370
you're indeed reliable.

126
00:09:39,500 --> 00:09:41,430
The Ancient Dragon God.

127
00:09:41,950 --> 00:09:44,000
When it opens its eyes, it's daytime.

128
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,260
When it closes its eyes, it's nighttime.

129
00:09:53,670 --> 00:09:55,850
It seems you've finally realized it.

130
00:09:56,940 --> 00:09:58,080
Wen Xiao.

131
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:01,300
You've read thousands of books,

132
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:04,310
how did you not foresee this?

133
00:10:05,950 --> 00:10:08,670
Zhu Yin can not only summon wind and rain,

134
00:10:08,950 --> 00:10:11,530
and illuminate the nine dark and mysterious lands,

135
00:10:11,530 --> 00:10:14,310
but also control the alternation of day and night,

136
00:10:14,310 --> 00:10:15,520
making the night

137
00:10:15,590 --> 00:10:17,320
arrive early.

138
00:10:29,070 --> 00:10:30,230
Look,

139
00:10:37,520 --> 00:10:39,190
isn't this blood moon

140
00:10:40,060 --> 00:10:43,930
more beautiful than the bright moon of the mortal world?

141
00:12:10,570 --> 00:12:11,660
Jiu.

142
00:12:12,050 --> 00:12:12,980
How are you?

143
00:12:13,010 --> 00:12:14,020
Sister Pei.

144
00:12:15,710 --> 00:12:18,600
Who were those people just now?

145
00:12:19,620 --> 00:12:21,220
They were from Chongwu Camp.

146
00:12:21,610 --> 00:12:23,200
People from Chongwu Camp?

147
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:24,760
What do they want?

148
00:12:27,270 --> 00:12:28,190
I don't know.

149
00:12:29,290 --> 00:12:31,500
I was about to ask them what they were doing

150
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:32,770
when you appeared.

151
00:12:34,900 --> 00:12:35,960
Jiu?

152
00:12:44,120 --> 00:12:45,120
Sister Pei!

153
00:12:46,470 --> 00:12:48,500
Then I was knocked unconscious.

154
00:12:55,100 --> 00:12:56,130
The blood moon.

155
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:41,070
Zhao Yuanzhou...

156
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:43,330
Zhao Yuanzhou!

157
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:50,830
He's being controlled by the malicious energy!

158
00:13:50,830 --> 00:13:51,560
Great Demon!

159
00:13:51,860 --> 00:13:52,990
Great Demon Zhu Yan!

160
00:14:01,080 --> 00:14:01,880
Zhu Yin,

161
00:14:02,350 --> 00:14:03,630
take action.

162
00:14:03,790 --> 00:14:05,420
Destroy the Baize Token.

163
00:14:06,010 --> 00:14:08,130
Break through the shackles of two realms.

164
00:14:08,130 --> 00:14:09,490
Our goal

165
00:14:09,520 --> 00:14:11,230
is about to be realized.

166
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:00,570
This is bad.

167
00:17:00,710 --> 00:17:03,150
Li Lun's seal has been broken.

168
00:17:42,220 --> 00:17:43,940
Don't get it wrong.

169
00:17:44,120 --> 00:17:46,060
Your enemy now

170
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:47,650
is not me.

171
00:18:35,510 --> 00:18:36,990
Blindness.

172
00:18:56,130 --> 00:18:57,130
Zhao Yuanzhou...

173
00:18:57,320 --> 00:18:58,260
Snap out of it.

174
00:19:12,550 --> 00:19:13,640
Zhao Yuanzhou!

175
00:19:13,830 --> 00:19:14,960
Snap out of it!

176
00:19:15,390 --> 00:19:16,190
Ying Lei!

177
00:19:16,630 --> 00:19:17,420
Alright!

178
00:20:02,830 --> 00:20:03,830
Lady Goddess,

179
00:20:03,830 --> 00:20:04,760
hurry and leave!

180
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:09,800
Look.

181
00:20:11,240 --> 00:20:13,070
This is his true self.

182
00:20:16,040 --> 00:20:18,500
Now that the Baize Token has been destroyed,

183
00:20:19,850 --> 00:20:22,780
Zhao Yuanzhou's malicious energy is out of control.

184
00:20:24,830 --> 00:20:27,870
Prepare for bloodshed in the mortal world.

185
00:20:57,090 --> 00:20:58,750
Why did you teach me?

186
00:20:59,390 --> 00:21:00,870
Didn't I tell you?

187
00:21:00,950 --> 00:21:02,370
I want you to kill me.

188
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:07,690
I, Zhuo Yichen,

189
00:21:08,840 --> 00:21:10,630
swear to the heavens.

190
00:21:12,420 --> 00:21:13,710
As long as Zhu Yan teaches me

191
00:21:13,710 --> 00:21:15,970
the true way to use the Cloud Light Sword,

192
00:21:17,850 --> 00:21:20,420
I will surely slay him with my blade.

193
00:21:22,940 --> 00:21:24,160
If I break this oath,

194
00:21:25,880 --> 00:21:27,680
may heaven and earth destroy me,

195
00:21:28,110 --> 00:21:29,910
and my soul scatter to the winds.

196
00:21:30,760 --> 00:21:32,000
Zhuo,

197
00:21:32,170 --> 00:21:33,900
this isn't his true intention.

198
00:21:34,730 --> 00:21:37,130
He's just controlled by malicious energy.

199
00:21:38,370 --> 00:21:39,520
If I don't kill him,

200
00:21:40,890 --> 00:21:42,500
everyone will die.

201
00:21:48,470 --> 00:21:49,850
Interesting.

202
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:53,180
You're in a dilemma.

203
00:21:53,620 --> 00:21:55,510
How will you choose?

204
00:21:56,730 --> 00:21:58,530
Baize Goddess,

205
00:21:59,670 --> 00:22:02,150
you're so protective of Zhao Yuanzhou.

206
00:22:03,790 --> 00:22:05,510
But do you know

207
00:22:06,260 --> 00:22:08,540
that he is also your enemy?

208
00:22:10,630 --> 00:22:13,320
Your master, Zhao Wan'er,

209
00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:17,380
was killed by Zhao Yuanzhou.

210
00:22:18,590 --> 00:22:21,000
He has been deceiving you all along.

211
00:22:25,830 --> 00:22:27,830
Here's a memory for you.

212
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:31,280
Do you want to see it?

213
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:51,170
Do you dare to see it?

214
00:23:03,180 --> 00:23:04,110
Li Lun,

215
00:23:04,140 --> 00:23:05,470
do you know your crimes?

216
00:23:05,720 --> 00:23:07,610
What crimes have I committed?

217
00:23:07,860 --> 00:23:09,720
You have committed three crimes.

218
00:23:09,950 --> 00:23:10,810
First,

219
00:23:10,830 --> 00:23:12,510
defying the authority of the Baize Token.

220
00:23:12,510 --> 00:23:13,470
Second,

221
00:23:13,470 --> 00:23:15,000
leaving the Wilderness without permission.

222
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:16,000
Third,

223
00:23:16,160 --> 00:23:17,940
indiscriminately killing innocents in the mortal world.

224
00:23:17,940 --> 00:23:19,120
Zhao Wan'er,

225
00:23:19,550 --> 00:23:21,940
you are just a mortal.

226
00:23:22,290 --> 00:23:25,350
Who are you to interfere in the affairs of the Wilderness?

227
00:23:25,350 --> 00:23:27,320
I carry the bloodline of Baize,

228
00:23:28,310 --> 00:23:30,520
so it is my duty to protect the Wilderness.

229
00:23:30,520 --> 00:23:31,940
Of course I must intervene.

230
00:23:31,940 --> 00:23:33,810
Then I'll kill you.

231
00:23:34,510 --> 00:23:36,510
Let's see how you intervene then.

232
00:23:38,100 --> 00:23:39,290
Master!

233
00:23:41,670 --> 00:23:42,470
Wen Xiao!

234
00:24:01,590 --> 00:24:02,500
Freeze.

235
00:25:18,800 --> 00:25:21,120
What punishment will he receive?

236
00:25:23,540 --> 00:25:25,670
He will be sealed at his Place of Birth,

237
00:25:26,390 --> 00:25:27,850
repenting every day.

238
00:25:30,200 --> 00:25:32,800
For someone who yearns for freedom like him,

239
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:37,320
that might be even worse

240
00:25:38,800 --> 00:25:40,600
than having his soul scattered.

241
00:25:42,180 --> 00:25:43,230
You can't bear it?

242
00:25:45,870 --> 00:25:47,320
I almost forgot.

243
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:49,260
You're close friends.

244
00:28:22,130 --> 00:28:23,870
Go find her.

245
00:29:34,910 --> 00:29:37,450
♫A lone boat drifts through the world♫

246
00:29:37,490 --> 00:29:40,100
♫The heart feels bitter, then sweet♫

247
00:29:40,490 --> 00:29:45,510
♫Can't distinguish night from day♫

248
00:29:46,800 --> 00:29:48,730
♫At the edge of the dreamscape♫

249
00:29:48,890 --> 00:29:51,450
♫Someone is longing for♫

250
00:29:51,640 --> 00:29:52,710
♫Softly calling for♫

251
00:29:52,750 --> 00:29:56,860
♫A past that can't be brought back♫

252
00:29:57,230 --> 00:29:59,860
♫The world echoes with a single sigh♫

253
00:29:59,910 --> 00:30:02,440
♫Love and hate each fills half the heart♫

254
00:30:02,670 --> 00:30:07,680
♫The years are filled with grudges and grace♫

255
00:30:08,890 --> 00:30:11,020
♫The cry of summer cicadas♫

256
00:30:11,090 --> 00:30:13,650
♫The slumber of winter snow♫

257
00:30:13,820 --> 00:30:19,050
♫No idle wishes and no hopeless longing for eternity♫

258
00:30:30,540 --> 00:30:35,300
♫The flower in my palm♫

259
00:30:35,730 --> 00:30:40,880
♫Is everchanging♫

260
00:30:41,150 --> 00:30:45,990
♫Sand slips through fingertips♫

261
00:30:46,890 --> 00:30:51,890
♫Struggling again and again♫

262
00:30:52,570 --> 00:30:57,330
♫The sea of suffering has no end♫

263
00:30:58,250 --> 00:31:02,370
♫The spring breeze asks him♫

264
00:31:02,450 --> 00:31:08,190
♫What troubles turned his hair white♫

265
00:32:31,670 --> 00:32:33,250
But if one day,

266
00:32:33,750 --> 00:32:36,410
you find out I've done something unforgivable,

267
00:32:39,490 --> 00:32:40,880
what will you do?

268
00:32:43,910 --> 00:32:46,830
Most unforgivable things in this world

269
00:32:48,400 --> 00:32:51,730
are because we can't understand why the other person did it,

270
00:32:52,310 --> 00:32:53,970
that's why it's hard to let go.

271
00:32:55,990 --> 00:32:58,190
If you're willing to tell me the reason,

272
00:32:59,220 --> 00:33:01,020
perhaps I might understand you.

273
00:33:15,660 --> 00:33:18,400
If Zhao Yuanzhou really killed Wen Xiao's master,

274
00:33:18,400 --> 00:33:20,180
why didn't you tell us before?

275
00:33:22,100 --> 00:33:24,260
What's the fun in letting you know

276
00:33:25,170 --> 00:33:27,010
the truth like that?

277
00:33:29,720 --> 00:33:32,240
If you hold a grudge against Zhao Yuanzhou,

278
00:33:33,230 --> 00:33:35,990
you'll never be able to connect with him again.

279
00:33:37,910 --> 00:33:40,630
Then the Baize Token can never be merged,

280
00:33:43,160 --> 00:33:45,930
and I'll never be able to destroy it.

281
00:33:48,110 --> 00:33:50,060
To destroy the Baize Token,

282
00:33:51,080 --> 00:33:53,880
we need the most yin malicious energy in the world.

283
00:33:54,500 --> 00:33:56,340
When the blood moon appears,

284
00:33:57,150 --> 00:33:59,010
it will be extremely yin and evil.

285
00:34:00,670 --> 00:34:02,000
That's when we can do it.

286
00:34:02,360 --> 00:34:05,580
But now the Baize Token is split in two,

287
00:34:06,270 --> 00:34:09,270
attached to two different people.

288
00:34:10,430 --> 00:34:11,820
What should we do?

289
00:34:13,190 --> 00:34:14,639
We must make

290
00:34:15,360 --> 00:34:17,690
the two people who possess the Baize Token

291
00:34:18,610 --> 00:34:20,370
be of one mind.

292
00:34:32,010 --> 00:34:34,949
How do you know so much about this?

293
00:34:46,050 --> 00:34:47,820
I'm a person of my word.

294
00:34:49,800 --> 00:34:50,770
Here you go.

295
00:35:07,350 --> 00:35:09,100
You know the whereabouts of the Baize Token?

296
00:35:09,100 --> 00:35:09,900
Where is it?

297
00:35:17,310 --> 00:35:18,900
It's on you.

298
00:35:23,640 --> 00:35:25,250
This is against principles!

299
00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:28,330
Whose principles?

300
00:35:29,990 --> 00:35:32,920
Heaven's, the public's, or the law's?

301
00:35:34,300 --> 00:35:36,760
I only recognize the principles in my heart.

302
00:35:51,040 --> 00:35:51,980
Grandpa!

303
00:37:24,600 --> 00:37:26,930
I don't have time to play with you anymore.

304
00:37:27,890 --> 00:37:30,870
Zhao Yuanzhou will kill all of you anyway.

305
00:37:31,490 --> 00:37:32,580
Zhuo Yichen,

306
00:37:33,170 --> 00:37:34,450
don't forget.

307
00:37:35,200 --> 00:37:36,720
At the final moment,

308
00:37:37,870 --> 00:37:40,680
your Cloud Light Sword can kill him.

309
00:37:45,170 --> 00:37:47,530
I look forward to your decision.

310
00:38:57,450 --> 00:38:58,220
Grandpa!

311
00:39:07,680 --> 00:39:08,610
Mr. Zhuo,

312
00:39:08,950 --> 00:39:10,350
don't hesitate anymore.

313
00:39:10,960 --> 00:39:12,140
Do it.

314
00:39:39,810 --> 00:39:40,760
Zhuo!

315
00:39:40,790 --> 00:39:41,850
What are you doing?

316
00:39:48,730 --> 00:39:49,530
Ying Lei!

317
00:40:50,460 --> 00:40:52,460
The Baize Token has been destroyed.

318
00:40:53,500 --> 00:40:56,140
I have finally succeeded.

319
00:40:58,600 --> 00:41:00,340
However...

320
00:41:02,790 --> 00:41:04,690
Zhao Yuanzhou.

321
00:41:06,530 --> 00:41:10,400
If you really die at the hands of Zhuo Yichen,

322
00:41:12,140 --> 00:41:13,960
it would be somewhat of a pity.

323
00:41:14,900 --> 00:41:16,630
He's not worthy of killing you.

324
00:41:21,590 --> 00:41:23,600
Please make sure you keep your word.

325
00:41:24,030 --> 00:41:24,890
But I

326
00:41:24,990 --> 00:41:26,060
can't kill you.

327
00:41:26,230 --> 00:41:27,630
You don't need to kill me.

328
00:41:27,940 --> 00:41:29,280
Just suppress me.

329
00:41:29,940 --> 00:41:31,050
What should I do?

330
00:41:34,910 --> 00:41:35,880
Zhuo!

331
00:41:36,030 --> 00:41:37,090
What are you doing?

332
00:42:07,640 --> 00:42:08,560
Mr. Zhuo,

333
00:42:08,590 --> 00:42:09,760
it's up to you now!

334
00:42:27,580 --> 00:42:28,800
Apply the blood of

335
00:42:28,960 --> 00:42:29,890
the divine race,

336
00:42:30,070 --> 00:42:31,310
the demon race,

337
00:42:31,330 --> 00:42:32,780
and the Bingyi Clan

338
00:42:32,990 --> 00:42:35,320
simultaneously on the Cloud Light Sword.

339
00:42:35,570 --> 00:42:37,060
This will maximize

340
00:42:37,090 --> 00:42:39,100
the power of the Cloud Light Sword.

341
00:43:07,040 --> 00:43:07,900
Ying Lei!

342
00:43:50,860 --> 00:43:52,770
You still won't let go?

343
00:43:55,710 --> 00:43:59,070
Then I'll cripple both your hands.

344
00:44:00,370 --> 00:44:01,940
A few minor injuries

345
00:44:01,960 --> 00:44:03,740
are nothing to worry about.

346
00:44:03,930 --> 00:44:05,100
This blood

347
00:44:05,270 --> 00:44:08,550
will only make my sword sharper!

348
00:44:25,550 --> 00:44:26,790
Dream...

349
00:44:40,360 --> 00:44:41,160
Zhuo!

350
00:44:44,540 --> 00:44:45,340
Mr. Zhuo!
