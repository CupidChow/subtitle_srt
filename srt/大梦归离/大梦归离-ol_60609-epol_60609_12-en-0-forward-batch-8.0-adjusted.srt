Hey.

Fei?

154

that this kind of demon can deplete water

156

and wither grass.

157
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,860
And its appearance would bring plague to the world.

158
00:09:36,030 --> 00:09:36,910
So you are the root cause

he is without malice.

162
00:09:50,350 --> 00:09:52,710

00:10:58,470 --> 00:10:59,390
Where is he?

179
00:11:04,520 --> 00:11:06,950
Why do you want Zhao Yuanzhou's inner core?

180
00:11:09,090 --> 00:11:10,790
Because I want freedom.

181
00:11:13,110 --> 00:11:15,170
What does Zhao Yuanzhou's inner core

182
00:11:15,180 --> 00:11:18,080
have to do with your freedom?

183
00:11:19,630 --> 00:11:22,490
There is a blood feud between you and Zhao Yuanzhou.

184
00:11:23,310 --> 00:11:25,550
How would you feel

185
00:11:25,550 --> 00:11:26,550
to be with someone

186
00:11:27,150 --> 00:11:28,830
who is your sworn enemy?

187
00:11:29,910 --> 00:11:31,320
Would you hate him?

188
00:11:34,470 --> 00:11:35,350
I...

189
00:11:38,820 --> 00:11:41,050
He killed your father and brother.

190
00:11:41,510 --> 00:11:43,850
He killed so many innocent people,

191
00:11:44,030 --> 00:11:45,780
but you can't kill him.

192
00:11:46,130 --> 00:11:47,990
And you have to face him every day.

193
00:11:49,910 --> 00:11:51,910
How can you not hate him?

194
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:16,130
You should hate him.

195
00:12:17,190 --> 00:12:18,960
What's in this incense burner?

196
00:12:24,950 --> 00:12:26,300
This is Lingxi Villa.

197
00:12:26,450 --> 00:12:28,360
Of course it's a rhinoceros horn.

198
00:12:33,380 --> 00:12:34,700
Burning rhinoceros horns

199
00:12:34,700 --> 00:12:36,100
can connect Yin and Yang.

200
00:12:36,710 --> 00:12:40,510
It can help me attract the malicious energy in and outside the villa.

201
00:12:49,370 --> 00:12:50,490
Mr. Zhuo.

202
00:12:51,560 --> 00:12:53,690
Do you know what malicious energy is?

203
00:12:54,950 --> 00:12:57,130
Hatred in this world

204
00:12:57,160 --> 00:12:58,990
transforms into malicious energy.

205
00:12:58,990 --> 00:13:01,540
It's natural sustenance for fierce beasts.

206
00:13:02,050 --> 00:13:03,820
It can also awaken the hatred and pain

207
00:13:03,820 --> 00:13:05,180
deep in your heart.

208
00:13:07,190 --> 00:13:08,310
Come on.

209
00:13:08,610 --> 00:13:10,810
Listen to the hatred deep in your heart.

210
00:13:11,190 --> 00:13:13,920
Let it tell you what to do.

211
00:13:30,520 --> 00:13:32,360
Kill him.

212
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:02,690
It's dark in the secret tunnel.

213
00:14:02,690 --> 00:14:04,230
Let's use the Baize Divine Power

214
00:14:04,230 --> 00:14:06,140
to explore it.

215
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:17,030
As a great demon,

216
00:14:17,510 --> 00:14:19,770
you actually need my power

217
00:14:20,150 --> 00:14:21,750
to feel the barrier?

218
00:14:24,150 --> 00:14:26,030
Actually, I can do it myself.

219
00:14:28,070 --> 00:14:30,530
Just say it if you want to hold Xiao's hand.

220
00:14:33,510 --> 00:14:34,830
You're a kid.

221
00:14:34,830 --> 00:14:36,010
You already understand this kind of thing?

222
00:14:36,010 --> 00:14:38,280
I remember I first knew what love is

223
00:14:38,380 --> 00:14:40,770
when I was 370 years old.

224
00:14:41,710 --> 00:14:42,760
Zhao Yuanzhou.

225
00:14:43,550 --> 00:14:44,740
Go to jail.

226
00:14:50,580 --> 00:14:51,630
Let's go.

227
00:14:52,390 --> 00:14:53,190
Let's go.

228
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:53,950
Let's go.

229
00:15:12,390 --> 00:15:13,190
What's wrong?

230
00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:20,410
Our route here has been completely blocked off.

231
00:15:31,310 --> 00:15:33,070
Kill him.

232
00:15:40,680 --> 00:15:42,460
You scared me.

233
00:15:42,790 --> 00:15:43,870
Friend,

234
00:15:44,310 --> 00:15:45,850
why are you so mysterious?

235
00:16:07,270 --> 00:16:08,350
What is this?

236
00:16:13,760 --> 00:16:15,630
In a world plagued by a disease,

237
00:16:15,740 --> 00:16:18,540
Qing Geng Goddess used red pigments

238
00:16:18,620 --> 00:16:20,350
to dye Jinli stones

239
00:16:20,690 --> 00:16:22,090
and gave them to everyone

240
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:23,640
to ensure their safety.

241
00:16:26,790 --> 00:16:28,180
The people on the mural

242
00:16:28,210 --> 00:16:30,010
also have the red bead bracelet.

243
00:16:35,660 --> 00:16:37,450
Qing Geng Goddess?

244
00:16:39,010 --> 00:16:41,400
Everybody wants to be a goddess.

245
00:16:41,820 --> 00:16:44,620
Do they really think it's very easy to be a goddess?

246
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:47,070
I learned from a book

247
00:16:47,100 --> 00:16:49,580
that Qing Geng lives on cypress trees,

248
00:16:50,210 --> 00:16:51,790
living off their flowers and fruits.

249
00:16:51,790 --> 00:16:54,190
It does have the ability to ward off plague.

250
00:16:54,740 --> 00:16:55,850
Qing Geng...

251
00:16:56,190 --> 00:16:58,330
can only protect herself from plague.

252
00:16:59,030 --> 00:17:00,150
In fact,

253
00:17:00,150 --> 00:17:01,890
she is just an ordinary demon.

254
00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:03,870
I saw her in the Wilderness before.

255
00:17:03,870 --> 00:17:06,670
She was always flying in the forest.

256
00:17:07,790 --> 00:17:09,190
She was noisier than Jiu.

257
00:17:09,530 --> 00:17:10,820
How can a small sparrow

258
00:17:11,790 --> 00:17:13,510
be called a goddess?

259
00:17:19,150 --> 00:17:21,089
Most so-called deities exist

260
00:17:21,950 --> 00:17:24,750
merely to satisfy people's desires.

261
00:17:26,190 --> 00:17:27,650
When they want something,

262
00:17:28,980 --> 00:17:30,829
they turn to deities.

263
00:17:31,160 --> 00:17:32,760
But when a calamity strikes,

264
00:17:34,710 --> 00:17:36,450
they would complain

265
00:17:36,990 --> 00:17:38,790
that deities are unresponsive,

266
00:17:39,150 --> 00:17:40,430
nature is merciless,

267
00:17:41,340 --> 00:17:42,710
and all beings suffer.

268
00:17:44,310 --> 00:17:46,970
Then they would do bad things without guilt

269
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:48,240
and shift the blame

270
00:17:48,830 --> 00:17:51,640
to those imagined deities.

271
00:17:57,190 --> 00:17:59,890
If everyone wearing this bead died,

272
00:18:01,040 --> 00:18:03,580
it was not for warding off the plague.

273
00:18:03,910 --> 00:18:05,000
Could it be...

274
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:07,460
But there's only an ordinary mural here.

275
00:18:08,070 --> 00:18:09,310
There is no exit.

276
00:18:11,470 --> 00:18:12,030
Fei.

277
00:18:16,100 --> 00:18:16,750
Fei?

278
00:18:19,110 --> 00:18:20,240
He's so mysterious.

279
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:25,370
Since Qing Geng

280
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:27,260
wants to be a goddess desperately

281
00:18:27,660 --> 00:18:29,030
and wants everyone

282
00:18:29,050 --> 00:18:30,580
to worship her as a goddess,

283
00:18:31,750 --> 00:18:33,500
let's just do it.

284
00:18:33,830 --> 00:18:34,430
What?

285
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:44,670
Goddess, you...

286
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:05,330
Let's go.

287
00:19:06,820 --> 00:19:08,420
We don't know what's inside.

288
00:19:08,810 --> 00:19:09,670
Zhao Yuanzhou,

289
00:19:10,050 --> 00:19:10,890
you go first.

290
00:19:10,990 --> 00:19:12,320
I'll follow in the rear.

291
00:19:15,430 --> 00:19:15,990
Let's go.

292
00:19:28,540 --> 00:19:29,470
Wen!

293
00:19:29,470 --> 00:19:30,070
Goddess!

294
00:19:30,100 --> 00:19:30,830
Great Demon!

295
00:19:30,990 --> 00:19:32,090
Open the door!

296
00:19:32,430 --> 00:19:34,840
So, is what you found an exit

297
00:19:35,110 --> 00:19:36,150
or a trap?

298
00:19:38,550 --> 00:19:39,880
Whatever it is,

299
00:19:39,900 --> 00:19:41,320
we can only move forward.

300
00:19:41,950 --> 00:19:42,750
Come on.

301
00:19:43,380 --> 00:19:44,800
Protect me.

302
00:19:45,150 --> 00:19:46,410
Or we'll die together.

303
00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:48,470
Of course.

304
00:19:51,430 --> 00:19:52,730
Open the door!

305
00:19:53,750 --> 00:19:55,120
Why won't it open?

306
00:19:55,680 --> 00:19:57,210
Sister Pei, try praying...

307
00:19:58,420 --> 00:19:59,950
The door is not responding.

308
00:20:00,790 --> 00:20:01,470
It won't

309
00:20:01,470 --> 00:20:02,060
open.

310
00:20:02,190 --> 00:20:02,920
Is it broken?

311
00:20:06,830 --> 00:20:07,870
Sister Pei!

312
00:20:07,990 --> 00:20:08,870
Sister Pei, what's wrong?

313
00:20:08,870 --> 00:20:09,540
Sister Pei!

314
00:20:12,590 --> 00:20:13,230
Gosh!

315
00:20:13,630 --> 00:20:15,480
Sister Pei, you have been infected with the plague!

316
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:16,270
The plague?

317
00:20:37,690 --> 00:20:38,930
Zhuo.

318
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:21,380
Zhao Yuanzhou.

319
00:21:21,830 --> 00:21:22,740
Zhuo.

320
00:22:07,590 --> 00:22:08,260
Zhuo.

321
00:22:08,260 --> 00:22:09,080
Don't come near us!

322
00:22:09,080 --> 00:22:10,270
He's being controlled by malicious energy.

323
00:22:10,270 --> 00:22:11,670
He's very dangerous now.

324
00:22:13,850 --> 00:22:16,310
Why is there so much malicious energy on you?

325
00:22:16,770 --> 00:22:18,400
I'm going to kill you.

326
00:22:19,950 --> 00:22:22,330
We share the same thought and are like-minded.

327
00:22:22,330 --> 00:22:23,990
But you can't do it now.

328
00:22:27,510 --> 00:22:28,450
Don't move.

329
00:22:29,080 --> 00:22:30,010
I'm helping you.

330
00:22:31,350 --> 00:22:32,870
I'm going to kill you.

331
00:22:33,040 --> 00:22:34,770
I promised you long ago, right?

332
00:22:35,640 --> 00:22:37,150
But not now.

333
00:23:40,350 --> 00:23:42,630
It's you, an evil bird.

334
00:23:53,050 --> 00:23:54,650
I've heard a lot about you,

335
00:23:54,710 --> 00:23:55,670
Zhu Yan.

336
00:23:56,430 --> 00:23:57,760
After seeing you today,

337
00:23:58,190 --> 00:24:01,250
I think you truly are as insufferable as the rumor says.

338
00:24:08,840 --> 00:24:11,080
In order to control the malicious energy on him,

339
00:24:11,080 --> 00:24:13,410
you must have used a lot of demonic power.

340
00:24:16,650 --> 00:24:18,380
I have plenty of demonic power.

341
00:24:19,770 --> 00:24:21,280
I know that.

342
00:24:21,810 --> 00:24:23,030
But you can't restore it

343
00:24:23,030 --> 00:24:24,110
within a short time,

344
00:24:24,110 --> 00:24:24,910
can you?

345
00:24:26,860 --> 00:24:28,150
I didn't expect

346
00:24:28,330 --> 00:24:30,780
the famous evil demon

347
00:24:30,800 --> 00:24:33,430
to hurt himself in order to save someone.

348
00:24:34,110 --> 00:24:35,030
Zhu Yan,

349
00:24:35,550 --> 00:24:38,220
I didn't know you have such a kind heart.

350
00:24:41,060 --> 00:24:42,470
The person I want to save

351
00:24:43,150 --> 00:24:44,420
is not just someone.

352
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:46,290
He's my good friend.

353
00:24:47,940 --> 00:24:50,000
You consider him as your good friend.

354
00:24:50,560 --> 00:24:52,360
But what does he consider you as?

355
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:54,710
Zhuo Yichen,

356
00:24:54,760 --> 00:24:56,890
who is the man standing in front of you?

357
00:24:58,030 --> 00:24:59,790
My sworn enemy.

358
00:25:03,070 --> 00:25:04,930
What should you do when your enemy

359
00:25:05,230 --> 00:25:06,760
is standing in front of you?

360
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:10,160
I should kill him.

361
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:15,480
Zhuo.

362
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:18,060
Zhuo.

363
00:25:24,470 --> 00:25:26,180
What exactly do you want?

364
00:25:27,670 --> 00:25:29,470
I want your inner core.

365
00:25:31,450 --> 00:25:32,610
You have one.

366
00:25:33,430 --> 00:25:35,060
Why do you want mine?

367
00:25:36,780 --> 00:25:38,060
In this world,

368
00:25:38,110 --> 00:25:39,810
only your inner core

369
00:25:40,210 --> 00:25:42,660
can destroy the seal of the Baize Token.

370
00:25:47,790 --> 00:25:50,520
I want to break the Baize seal on me

371
00:25:52,300 --> 00:25:54,060
and regain freedom.

372
00:25:57,230 --> 00:25:58,110
Seal?

373
00:26:00,350 --> 00:26:02,410
Because of this damn seal,

374
00:26:03,170 --> 00:26:04,470
I've been trapped in Lingxi Villa

375
00:26:04,470 --> 00:26:06,670
and I can never go out.

376
00:26:07,890 --> 00:26:10,180
Baize Goddess was so cruel.

377
00:26:18,050 --> 00:26:19,350
Zhuo Yichen,

378
00:26:19,450 --> 00:26:20,520
what are you waiting for?

379
00:26:20,520 --> 00:26:21,740
Kill him!

380
00:26:32,510 --> 00:26:33,380
Zhuo.

381
00:26:34,820 --> 00:26:35,810
Zhuo!

382
00:26:45,630 --> 00:26:46,800
Zhuo!

383
00:27:39,510 --> 00:27:42,710
The malicious energy and demonic energy here are really strong.

384
00:27:42,710 --> 00:27:44,340
They even blinded me.

385
00:27:44,500 --> 00:27:47,560
I didn't realize there is a seal of the Baize Token.

386
00:27:50,230 --> 00:27:53,150
You two were acting to trick me?

387
00:27:53,220 --> 00:27:54,100
No.

388
00:27:54,430 --> 00:27:55,660
I was not acting.

389
00:27:55,910 --> 00:27:57,680
My fear was real.

390
00:27:57,830 --> 00:27:59,440
Mr. Zhuo's Cloud Light Sword

391
00:27:59,550 --> 00:28:00,780
is really scary.

392
00:28:01,550 --> 00:28:02,980
I am scarier.

393
00:28:03,150 --> 00:28:04,260
Do you want to try?

394
00:28:05,030 --> 00:28:05,590
Okay.

395
00:28:06,570 --> 00:28:08,830
When did you regain your consciousness?

396
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:14,200
Don't move.

397
00:28:14,440 --> 00:28:15,370
I'm helping you.

398
00:28:16,400 --> 00:28:18,200
I'm going to kill you.

399
00:28:18,460 --> 00:28:19,390
I promised you long ago,

400
00:28:19,390 --> 00:28:20,070
right?

401
00:28:20,900 --> 00:28:22,420
But not now.

402
00:28:46,170 --> 00:28:47,150
Let me kill...

403
00:28:47,900 --> 00:28:49,410
You've regained your consciousness, right?

404
00:28:49,410 --> 00:28:50,820
Why do you still look stupid?

405
00:28:50,820 --> 00:28:52,130
You're the stupid one!

406
00:28:52,310 --> 00:28:54,260
Don't you want to know Qing Geng's real purpose?

407
00:28:54,260 --> 00:28:55,730
Do what you're good at.

408
00:28:56,230 --> 00:28:57,070
Now?

409
00:28:58,070 --> 00:28:59,350
I don't think it's a good time.

410
00:28:59,350 --> 00:29:00,150
Acting.

411
00:29:01,070 --> 00:29:02,640
I meant acting.

412
00:29:03,430 --> 00:29:03,990
Oh.

413
00:29:05,590 --> 00:29:07,690
Are you sure you are not taking this opportunity to settle personal grudges?

414
00:29:07,690 --> 00:29:08,900
No!

415
00:29:10,550 --> 00:29:11,470
Mr. Zhuo,

416
00:29:11,910 --> 00:29:12,700
are you

417
00:29:13,070 --> 00:29:14,310
ready?

418
00:29:14,340 --> 00:29:15,210
Shut up!

419
00:29:18,600 --> 00:29:19,840
What a pity.

420
00:29:20,630 --> 00:29:23,360
Indeed, the seal of the Baize Token can be broken.

421
00:29:23,820 --> 00:29:26,520
But it requires me to use the malicious energy

422
00:29:26,870 --> 00:29:28,510
to cast the spell myself.

423
00:29:29,590 --> 00:29:30,680
If I die,

424
00:29:31,010 --> 00:29:33,610
it'll be useless even if you have my inner core.

425
00:29:34,230 --> 00:29:36,790
The one who tricked you into taking my inner core

426
00:29:36,790 --> 00:29:39,060
is either a fool or a liar.

427
00:29:41,710 --> 00:29:44,160
You're the liar.

428
00:29:45,750 --> 00:29:47,450
In this world,

429
00:29:48,060 --> 00:29:49,720
no one believes in sincerity.

430
00:29:50,270 --> 00:29:52,130
Hypocritical people always win.

431
00:29:55,990 --> 00:29:56,830
Forget it.

432
00:29:57,670 --> 00:29:59,930
I just want to know who tricked you

433
00:30:00,390 --> 00:30:02,730
into taking my inner core.

434
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:10,850
I can guess it even if you don't tell me.

435
00:30:11,300 --> 00:30:13,500
There is a loathsome and familiar smell

436
00:30:13,650 --> 00:30:15,460
on you.

437
00:30:19,690 --> 00:30:20,890
-Wen Xiao!
-Wen Xiao!

438
00:30:55,750 --> 00:30:56,590
So hot.

439
00:31:02,710 --> 00:31:03,690
Your hand...

440
00:31:03,950 --> 00:31:05,160
It really hurts.

441
00:31:06,310 --> 00:31:08,040
I meant that thing on your hand.

442
00:31:13,310 --> 00:31:14,440
It's the plague.

443
00:31:22,670 --> 00:31:23,930
Wen Xiao.

444
00:31:30,150 --> 00:31:30,920
Zhuo!

445
00:31:42,310 --> 00:31:43,270
Jiu,

446
00:31:43,300 --> 00:31:44,510
stay away from me.

447
00:31:45,510 --> 00:31:46,150
Yes.

448
00:31:46,310 --> 00:31:46,990
Come.

449
00:31:48,030 --> 00:31:49,590
Stay away from her.

450
00:31:50,350 --> 00:31:51,270
I'm half-god and half-demon.

451
00:31:51,270 --> 00:31:52,750
I have the bloodline of the God Race.

452
00:31:52,750 --> 00:31:53,680
I should be fine.

453
00:31:53,710 --> 00:31:54,230
Well,

454
00:31:54,750 --> 00:31:56,100
I'm fine too.

455
00:31:57,120 --> 00:31:58,240
That's strange.

456
00:32:02,910 --> 00:32:03,780
No.

457
00:32:03,820 --> 00:32:05,140
She's having a high fever.

458
00:32:05,140 --> 00:32:06,640
We need to get out of here as soon as possible.

459
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:07,870
Otherwise, she'll be in danger.

460
00:32:07,870 --> 00:32:08,510
Okay.

461
00:32:08,900 --> 00:32:11,040
Even if I have to break my knife,

462
00:32:11,150 --> 00:32:12,920
I'll dig a tunnel and crawl out.

463
00:32:13,990 --> 00:32:14,590
Huh?

464
00:32:19,130 --> 00:32:19,940
Fei?

465
00:32:24,810 --> 00:32:25,620
Qing Geng?

466
00:32:33,540 --> 00:32:34,540
What Qing Geng?

467
00:32:35,410 --> 00:32:37,540
Isn't the one he was helping Qing Geng?

468
00:32:37,750 --> 00:32:38,720
Are you sure?

469
00:32:38,950 --> 00:32:39,590
Yes.

470
00:32:39,610 --> 00:32:41,700
She looks exactly the same as the one on the mural.

471
00:32:41,700 --> 00:32:43,290
Take care of Sister Pei here.

472
00:32:43,290 --> 00:32:43,880
Hey.

473
00:32:43,920 --> 00:32:44,680
Bai Jiu!

474
00:32:45,230 --> 00:32:45,640
Hey.

475
00:33:01,650 --> 00:33:02,900
Don't come near me!

476
00:33:05,190 --> 00:33:06,540
I don't need you to save me

477
00:33:06,540 --> 00:33:07,850
or help me.

478
00:33:30,400 --> 00:33:30,990
Gosh!

479
00:33:31,070 --> 00:33:31,950
You're hurt.

480
00:33:34,760 --> 00:33:35,420
Let me do it.

481
00:33:35,460 --> 00:33:36,470
I'm a doctor.

482
00:33:43,870 --> 00:33:45,390
Why do you want to save me?

483
00:33:48,270 --> 00:33:49,570
My master always said

484
00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:51,000
doctors are benevolent.

485
00:33:51,620 --> 00:33:53,220
We can't just let people die.

486
00:34:04,610 --> 00:34:06,440
Doctors are benevolent.

487
00:34:08,190 --> 00:34:09,690
If I tell you

488
00:34:10,770 --> 00:34:13,700
I am the culprit who spread the plague,

489
00:34:14,820 --> 00:34:16,449
will you still save me?

490
00:34:18,409 --> 00:34:20,409
Actually, I've already guessed it.

491
00:34:21,699 --> 00:34:22,350
You spread the plague

492
00:34:22,350 --> 00:34:25,040
through those red bead bracelets, right?

493
00:34:29,320 --> 00:34:31,000
That red bead...

494
00:34:32,210 --> 00:34:33,960
was stained with Fei's blood.

495
00:34:36,980 --> 00:34:38,520
Why did you do that?

496
00:34:48,460 --> 00:34:50,280
Do you know I was

497
00:34:50,469 --> 00:34:52,920
a goddess worshipped by everyone?

498
00:34:55,150 --> 00:34:56,659
I've lived in this town

499
00:34:56,690 --> 00:34:58,130
for a few hundred years.

500
00:34:59,110 --> 00:35:01,070
People worshipped me

501
00:35:01,360 --> 00:35:02,659
and prayed to me

502
00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:04,429
that I could protect them

503
00:35:04,429 --> 00:35:05,700
from the plague.

504
00:35:07,220 --> 00:35:09,090
Their piety and faith

505
00:35:09,110 --> 00:35:10,380
gave me strength.

506
00:35:11,080 --> 00:35:13,000
So I blessed them

507
00:35:13,020 --> 00:35:14,180
and protected them.

508
00:35:15,150 --> 00:35:16,460
It was like

509
00:35:17,030 --> 00:35:19,330
feeling guilty for receiving their gifts

510
00:35:19,330 --> 00:35:20,750
and wanting

511
00:35:21,050 --> 00:35:23,260
to give them something in return.

512
00:35:26,730 --> 00:35:28,180
But one day,

513
00:35:28,350 --> 00:35:30,000
Fei came here.

514
00:35:31,750 --> 00:35:34,210
He is the origin of plague by nature.

515
00:35:35,050 --> 00:35:36,600
I did everything I could,

516
00:35:37,190 --> 00:35:39,790
but I still couldn't stop the calamity.

517
00:35:40,620 --> 00:35:42,230
Please save us.

518
00:36:17,980 --> 00:36:20,770
Many people died due to the plague.

519
00:36:21,490 --> 00:36:24,130
The survivors vented their anger

520
00:36:25,770 --> 00:36:27,440
and called me a liar

521
00:36:27,760 --> 00:36:28,760
and a fake god.

522
00:36:30,130 --> 00:36:32,510
They destroyed Lingxi Villa

523
00:36:33,040 --> 00:36:34,990
and splashed dirty water

524
00:36:35,010 --> 00:36:36,200
and filthy things

525
00:36:36,470 --> 00:36:37,550
on my statue.

526
00:36:38,250 --> 00:36:40,630
No one wanted to believe me

527
00:36:41,020 --> 00:36:42,280
or worship me anymore.

528
00:37:22,430 --> 00:37:23,930
Shortly afterwards,

529
00:37:24,460 --> 00:37:26,310
Baize Goddess also came.

530
00:37:37,930 --> 00:37:39,860
She realized Fei causes plague,

531
00:37:40,550 --> 00:37:42,630
while Qing Geng can ward off plague.

532
00:37:43,510 --> 00:37:45,780
I'm the natural enemy of Fei.

533
00:37:46,960 --> 00:37:49,430
In order to suppress Fei's plague miasma,

534
00:37:50,750 --> 00:37:52,540
Baize Goddess

535

[Lingxi Villa]

536
00:37:52,620 --> 00:37:53,670
sealed us

537
00:37:53,670 --> 00:37:55,830
in Lingxi Villa.

538
00:37:58,000 --> 00:37:59,360
I've been sealed here

539
00:37:59,360 --> 00:38:00,690
for a few hundred years.

540
00:38:02,630 --> 00:38:03,950
I can't

541
00:38:04,340 --> 00:38:05,750
see the end of it.

542
00:38:09,320 --> 00:38:10,810
You are a mortal

543
00:38:11,100 --> 00:38:12,580
and a young boy.

544
00:38:13,830 --> 00:38:15,270
Your life is short.

545
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:19,180
You can't understand this kind

546
00:38:19,470 --> 00:38:21,690
of endless suffering.

547
00:38:24,630 --> 00:38:26,290
Someone told me

548
00:38:27,160 --> 00:38:29,710
as long as I spread the plague

549
00:38:30,460 --> 00:38:32,020
to lure you here,

550
00:38:32,090 --> 00:38:33,850
kill Zhao Yuanzhou,

551
00:38:34,070 --> 00:38:35,720
and get his inner core,

552
00:38:36,510 --> 00:38:38,870
I could break the Baize seal

553
00:38:39,270 --> 00:38:40,570
and leave here.

554
00:38:51,090 --> 00:38:52,380
Brother Zhuo.

555
00:38:57,470 --> 00:38:59,530
I know the person you just mentioned.

556
00:38:59,790 --> 00:39:00,870
His name is Li Lun.

557
00:39:02,210 --> 00:39:03,320
Right?

558
00:39:09,780 --> 00:39:10,710
Qing Geng,

559
00:39:11,770 --> 00:39:13,290
you spread the plague

560
00:39:13,670 --> 00:39:15,260
to harm the mortal world.

561
00:39:15,330 --> 00:39:16,860
Do you confess to the crime?

562
00:39:19,640 --> 00:39:20,920
It was not her fault.

563
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:22,200
It was all my fault.

564
00:39:22,550 --> 00:39:23,660
Because of me,

565
00:39:24,080 --> 00:39:26,610
she was sentenced to life imprisonment here.

566
00:39:26,990 --> 00:39:28,190
So you can speak?

567
00:39:32,310 --> 00:39:33,450
If I were her,

568
00:39:35,020 --> 00:39:37,350
I would also resent fate for being unfair.

569
00:39:52,850 --> 00:39:54,580
I have a way to treat the plague.

570
00:39:54,680 --> 00:39:56,750
As long as you help me save her,

571
00:39:57,780 --> 00:39:59,500
I'll help you save everyone.

572
00:40:00,380 --> 00:40:01,770
Really?

573
00:40:07,190 --> 00:40:09,300
But she's badly injured.

574
00:40:09,750 --> 00:40:11,950
I'm afraid even deities can't save her.

575
00:40:14,060 --> 00:40:15,750
If we were somewhere else,

576
00:40:15,950 --> 00:40:17,650
I'm afraid she couldn't be saved.

577
00:40:17,650 --> 00:40:18,730
But here,

578
00:40:19,500 --> 00:40:21,000
maybe I can give it a try.

579
00:40:21,910 --> 00:40:23,190
You have a way?

580
00:40:24,160 --> 00:40:25,500
Because of the plague,

581
00:40:26,040 --> 00:40:28,880
Sinan Water Town is surrounded by malicious energy.

582
00:40:28,880 --> 00:40:31,010
The stronger the malicious energy is,

583
00:40:31,430 --> 00:40:33,230
the greater my demonic power is.

584
00:40:34,160 --> 00:40:36,540
I can try to use the malicious energy here

585
00:40:37,030 --> 00:40:38,170
to treat her.

586
00:41:25,190 --> 00:41:26,280
Thank you...

587
00:41:29,350 --> 00:41:30,450
for saving her.

588
00:41:35,300 --> 00:41:36,900
She is very important to you?

589
00:41:41,840 --> 00:41:42,870
Yes.

590
00:41:45,270 --> 00:41:46,320
Very important.

591
00:41:47,570 --> 00:41:49,990
I've been cursed by fate since I was born.

592
00:41:50,140 --> 00:41:51,580
Wherever I go,

593
00:41:50,360 --> 00:41:54,410
[Glorious Flowers in Spring and Solid Fruits in Autumn]

594
00:41:51,900 --> 00:41:53,100
plague arises.

595
00:41:53,950 --> 00:41:55,350
Both humans

596
00:41:55,710 --> 00:41:56,810
and demons

597
00:41:57,910 --> 00:42:00,040
consider me the source of calamity,

598
00:42:01,310 --> 00:42:02,150
fearing

599
00:42:03,320 --> 00:42:04,310
me.

600
00:42:31,280 --> 00:42:32,600
But she's different.

601
00:42:34,520 --> 00:42:36,740
She could have been

602
00:42:36,850 --> 00:42:38,330
a Qing Geng bird

603
00:42:39,720 --> 00:42:42,300
flying freely in the clear sky.

604
00:42:58,740 --> 00:43:00,600
I yearned to go to the mortal world

605
00:43:01,960 --> 00:43:04,960
and didn't want to be sealed in the barren Wilderness.

606
00:43:10,310 --> 00:43:11,560
So

607
00:43:12,390 --> 00:43:14,650
I escaped from the Wilderness secretly.

608
00:43:26,790 --> 00:43:29,320
The mortal world is prosperous and bustling.

609
00:43:29,340 --> 00:43:30,450
Grass, trees,

610
00:43:31,190 --> 00:43:32,590
flowers, and leaves

611
00:43:33,070 --> 00:43:35,110
are full of vitality.

612
00:43:38,320 --> 00:43:40,020
Only in the mortal world

613
00:43:40,650 --> 00:43:43,040
do I truly feel alive.
