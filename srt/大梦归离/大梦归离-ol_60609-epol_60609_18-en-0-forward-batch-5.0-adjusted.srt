3
00:02:05,190 --> 00:02:06,390
This is where

4
00:02:06,390 --> 00:02:07,920
Cheng Huang took us before,

5
00:02:09,870 --> 00:02:12,450
and further on is the dangerous Wilderness,

6
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:14,680
the place of birth of all demons.

7
00:02:14,910 --> 00:02:15,470
Well...

8
00:02:16,190 --> 00:02:17,240
The Wilderness?

9
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:20,070
It sounds like a desolate area.

10
00:02:20,190 --> 00:02:20,990
Yes.

11
00:02:21,870 --> 00:02:24,180
That's why all demons yearn for the mortal world.

12
00:02:24,180 --> 00:02:25,860
But as Ran Yi said,

13
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:27,829
it is our eternal hometown.

14
00:02:27,829 --> 00:02:28,630
Brother Zhuo,

15
00:02:31,030 --> 00:02:32,670
where is the Huaijiang Valley?

16
00:02:32,670 --> 00:02:34,480
Mountain God Ying Zhao said

17
00:02:34,829 --> 00:02:36,690
we could find the Yao Water there.

18
00:02:36,870 --> 00:02:37,670
Yes.

19
00:02:38,150 --> 00:02:39,910
water of Baize

20
00:02:40,020 --> 00:02:41,420
can moisten everything.

21
00:02:41,950 --> 00:02:43,810
It can make withered wood reborn.

22
00:02:44,190 --> 00:02:45,520
So,

23
00:02:45,990 --> 00:02:47,720
as long as we find the Yao Water,

24
00:02:47,829 --> 00:02:49,490
we can repair the Baize Token.

25
00:02:51,150 --> 00:02:52,750
Let's look for the Yao Water first

26
00:02:52,750 --> 00:02:54,150
and then the Divine Wood.

27
00:02:55,630 --> 00:02:56,829
I have to

28
00:02:57,510 --> 00:02:58,910
remind you.

29
00:03:00,110 --> 00:03:00,710
What?

30
00:03:02,070 --> 00:03:05,130
Huaijiang Valley is not only a place that has Yao Water,

31
00:03:05,190 --> 00:03:07,390
but also a place where Li Lun was sealed.

32
00:03:09,710 --> 00:03:11,920
He grew up there.

33
00:04:01,950 --> 00:04:03,150
I didn't expect that

34
00:04:03,270 --> 00:04:05,270
we can use the Shanhai Portal again.

35
00:04:05,420 --> 00:04:06,150
Great Demon,

36
00:04:06,300 --> 00:04:08,620
have you ever been there?

37
00:04:13,110 --> 00:04:13,590
Hey.

38
00:04:14,110 --> 00:04:14,840
Great Demon,

39
00:04:15,030 --> 00:04:17,010
did you think of the wrong place?

40
00:04:17,310 --> 00:04:19,230
Did you think of the Demon Hunting Bureau?

41
00:04:19,230 --> 00:04:21,430
Why did the Shanhai Portal send us back?

42
00:05:18,670 --> 00:05:19,360
No.

43
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:21,520
We're not in the Demon Hunting Bureau.

44
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:23,190
But the dreamland of Li Lun.

45
00:05:23,220 --> 00:05:26,090

you have to play a game with me.

lying is human nature.

are you a human

Of course I'm a human.

Sit tight.

Why did you ask the same question?

It's so boring.

Why don't you change to an interesting one?

132

This is the most interesting question.

133

I don't want to change my question.

134
00:11:09,340 --> 00:11:10,280
Answer me.

Looks like you have something to say.

143
00:11:59,580 --> 00:12:01,130

I won't kill you.

146

I'm not worried about that.

147
00:12:14,090 --> 00:12:14,690
Huh?

148
00:12:15,670 --> 00:12:17,400
You hate Zhao Yuanzhou so much.

149
00:12:18,040 --> 00:12:20,840
So, you will definitely torture me in front of him.

150
00:12:20,860 --> 00:12:22,910
But you captured me alone.

151
00:12:23,660 --> 00:12:24,940
Obviously,

152
00:12:25,370 --> 00:12:27,380
you didn't intend to kill me.

153
00:12:29,340 --> 00:12:31,530
So, I want to see

154
00:12:32,280 --> 00:12:34,090
what you're going to do.

155
00:12:36,910 --> 00:12:37,910
Brother Zhuo!

156
00:12:39,390 --> 00:12:40,440
Let him out,

157
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:42,720
or I'll chop you into pieces and burn you.

158
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:44,410
Liars are the worst.

159
00:12:44,470 --> 00:12:46,090
They should be eaten.

160
00:12:46,120 --> 00:12:47,160
I didn't lie.

161
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:48,310
I didn't expect

162
00:12:48,310 --> 00:12:50,750
Little Bunny is hiding something from us.

163

00:12:52,830 --> 00:12:53,870
Don't talk nonsense.

165
00:12:53,870 --> 00:12:55,430
Wen has golden pupils.

166
00:12:55,570 --> 00:12:57,090
If I were a demon,

167
00:12:57,120 --> 00:12:58,720
how can I hide it from her?

168
00:13:00,930 --> 00:13:02,240
In the vast Wilderness,

169

there are so many wonders.

170

Maybe there is a demon

who can conceal his identity from the Golden Pupils of Baize.

172

Mr. Zhuo,

173
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:15,930
you suspected me like this

174
00:13:18,340 --> 00:13:20,340
when we were in the Sinan Water Town.

175
00:13:21,790 --> 00:13:23,650
It's useless asking for his help.

176
00:13:23,950 --> 00:13:26,210
Mr. Zhuo has always been strict and fair.

177

Don't pick a pushover to bully.

00:13:32,110 --> 00:13:33,250
I am not a pushover.

179
00:13:37,090 --> 00:13:37,880
Jiu.

180
00:13:38,710 --> 00:13:39,510
Tell me.

181
00:13:40,350 --> 00:13:41,300
Are you

182
00:13:41,330 --> 00:13:42,810
hiding anything from us?

183
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:49,690
Brother Zhuo,

184
00:13:53,110 --> 00:13:54,510
I'm not a demon.

185
00:14:13,790 --> 00:14:14,590
Okay.

186
00:14:18,770 --> 00:14:19,840
Mr. Zhuo,

187
00:14:20,550 --> 00:14:21,880
do you trust me?

188
00:14:27,340 --> 00:14:29,200
I only trust my Cloud Light Sword.

189
00:14:44,540 --> 00:14:49,830
♫Has anyone seen a bird with a broken tail?♫

190
00:14:49,940 --> 00:14:55,120
♫The rain wet its feathers♫

191
00:14:56,830 --> 00:15:02,090
♫There're no worries in its eyes♫

192
00:15:02,260 --> 00:15:07,510
♫It just wants to sleep on a roof♫

193
00:15:08,420 --> 00:15:11,360
♫The bell jingles and sways♫

194
00:15:11,460 --> 00:15:14,330
♫Thoughts circle back and forth♫

195
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:20,070
♫Who can truly understand the essence of growing up?♫

196
00:15:20,710 --> 00:15:24,250
♫Life is grand♫

197
00:15:24,640 --> 00:15:27,020
♫Yet so small♫

198
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:26,440
It seems that Jiu is a human.

199
00:15:27,240 --> 00:15:28,420
If he were a demon,

200
00:15:27,520 --> 00:15:32,090
♫I hope everything is fine♫

201
00:15:28,700 --> 00:15:31,030
the Cloud Light Sword would have reacted.

202
00:15:31,780 --> 00:15:33,510
I'm not a demon.

203
00:15:33,910 --> 00:15:35,790
But you lied.

204
00:15:40,710 --> 00:15:42,630
The pagoda spirit makes sense.

205
00:15:43,510 --> 00:15:44,370
Zhao Yuanzhou,

206
00:15:44,790 --> 00:15:45,790
stop it.

207
00:15:45,970 --> 00:15:47,020
Okay.

208
00:15:48,280 --> 00:15:50,270
I was just joking

209
00:15:50,290 --> 00:15:51,690
since you're so nervous.

210
00:15:52,310 --> 00:15:54,270
I know Little Bunny is not a demon.

211
00:15:54,870 --> 00:15:58,400
No demon can hide from the Golden Pupils of the Goddess of Baize.

212
00:15:58,990 --> 00:15:59,910
Unless...

213
00:15:59,910 --> 00:16:00,840
What?

214
00:16:05,540 --> 00:16:06,500
Nothing.

215
00:16:06,970 --> 00:16:08,040
Since then,

216
00:16:08,780 --> 00:16:09,870
the liar is

217
00:16:11,210 --> 00:16:13,080
the spirit.

218
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:16,490
Jiu.

219
00:16:17,580 --> 00:16:18,390
Step back.

220
00:16:19,550 --> 00:16:20,150
Okay.

221
00:16:40,640 --> 00:16:41,800
Mr. Zhuo!

222
00:16:41,840 --> 00:16:43,500
You really trust me this time?

223
00:16:49,340 --> 00:16:50,660
You're right.

224
00:16:51,560 --> 00:16:53,020
Indeed, someone is lying.

225
00:16:53,640 --> 00:16:55,280
But it's not the four of us.

226
00:16:56,360 --> 00:16:57,200
It's you.

227
00:17:06,730 --> 00:17:08,060
It's your turn.

228
00:17:08,820 --> 00:17:10,040
Are you

229
00:17:10,300 --> 00:17:11,970
human or a demon?

230
00:17:13,109 --> 00:17:14,599
Of course, I'm a demon.

231
00:17:26,349 --> 00:17:27,400
You cheated.

232
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:28,599
You're playing dirty.

233
00:17:28,599 --> 00:17:30,730
You were the one who started cheating.

234
00:17:30,750 --> 00:17:33,410
This pagoda tree is clearly under your control.

235
00:17:33,430 --> 00:17:35,390
You're trying to sow discord among us,

236
00:17:35,390 --> 00:17:37,470
and you picked the softest target.

237
00:17:38,840 --> 00:17:40,970
Didn't you just say the softest target

238
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:42,770
was Mr. Zhuo?

239
00:17:44,680 --> 00:17:45,400
Huh?

240
00:17:48,750 --> 00:17:49,550
Retract.

241
00:18:13,970 --> 00:18:15,830
What were you just about to ask?

242
00:18:21,630 --> 00:18:23,390
Your true form is a pagoda tree.

243
00:18:24,350 --> 00:18:25,620
Then tell me,

244
00:18:25,710 --> 00:18:27,240
are you a demon or a monster?

245
00:18:32,310 --> 00:18:33,760
You asked me to ask,

246
00:18:34,590 --> 00:18:36,320
but when I do, you don't answer.

247
00:18:36,510 --> 00:18:37,310
What's wrong?

248
00:18:38,630 --> 00:18:40,590
Afraid I'll uncover your secrets?

249
00:18:50,980 --> 00:18:55,180
Pagoda trees are naturally prone to attracting dark and malicious energy.

250
00:18:55,870 --> 00:18:57,150
Since ancient times,

251
00:18:58,830 --> 00:19:00,720
we've been called ghost trees.

252
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,130
Oh,

253
00:19:06,030 --> 00:19:06,950
I understand.

254
00:19:08,070 --> 00:19:09,150
No wonder,

255
00:19:09,170 --> 00:19:11,430
the books record you as the Pagoda Ghost.

256
00:19:12,510 --> 00:19:13,310
Alright.

257
00:19:13,750 --> 00:19:14,830
Next question.

258
00:19:15,590 --> 00:19:16,250
Bring it on.

259
00:19:18,870 --> 00:19:20,280
About this rattle drum,

260
00:19:21,240 --> 00:19:22,740
what's its origin?

261
00:19:28,660 --> 00:19:30,190
Zhao Yuanzhou gave it to me.

262
00:19:31,470 --> 00:19:32,280
As expected.

263
00:19:35,640 --> 00:19:36,730
You know it?

264
00:19:39,040 --> 00:19:40,740
Did Zhao Yuanzhou tell you?

265
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:44,210
I saw it in the illusion of Cheng Huang's sundial.

266
00:19:51,970 --> 00:19:54,480
I want to play with the rattle drum!

267
00:19:56,030 --> 00:19:57,430
I want to play with the rattle drum!

268
00:19:57,430 --> 00:19:59,420
Be good. I'll take you home first.

269
00:19:59,830 --> 00:20:03,710
I want to play the rattle drum.

270
00:20:08,510 --> 00:20:09,310
Sir,

271
00:20:10,340 --> 00:20:11,210
how much is this?

272
00:20:11,210 --> 00:20:12,210
Five coins.

273
00:20:14,550 --> 00:20:14,950
Be good.

274
00:20:14,950 --> 00:20:15,490
Be a good boy.

275
00:20:15,490 --> 00:20:17,370
Let's go home now, alright?

276
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:21,510
No, I want to play with the rattle drum!

277
00:20:22,110 --> 00:20:23,470
Little one,

278
00:20:23,790 --> 00:20:24,670
do you like it?

279
00:20:25,910 --> 00:20:26,750
Take it.

280
00:20:26,750 --> 00:20:27,910
Thank you, Sir.

281
00:20:27,910 --> 00:20:28,350
Don't cry anymore.

282
00:20:28,350 --> 00:20:28,990
Thank you.

283
00:20:51,630 --> 00:20:53,070
What's

284
00:20:53,070 --> 00:20:54,070
this thing for?

285
00:20:57,170 --> 00:20:58,470
In the Wilderness,

286
00:20:58,670 --> 00:21:00,070
we can do many things

287
00:21:00,350 --> 00:21:01,510
with just a blink

288
00:21:01,510 --> 00:21:03,230
or a breath.

289
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,330
But in the mortal world,

290
00:21:05,620 --> 00:21:08,750
there are treasures that can achieve great things with minimal effort.

291
00:21:08,750 --> 00:21:10,400
Can you make others

292
00:21:10,630 --> 00:21:12,030
stop crying

293
00:21:12,160 --> 00:21:13,620
and smile?

294
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:15,700
It can.

295
00:21:21,450 --> 00:21:23,650
Since you were once friends,

296
00:21:24,310 --> 00:21:25,670
why

297
00:21:26,350 --> 00:21:28,080
did you become mortal enemies?

298
00:21:29,910 --> 00:21:30,950
Friends?

299
00:21:36,750 --> 00:21:39,030
How do you define "friends"?

300
00:21:40,910 --> 00:21:42,550
Sharing joy and sorrow?

301
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:48,980
Ridiculous.

302
00:21:55,970 --> 00:21:57,190
"Friends" is just

303
00:21:57,190 --> 00:21:59,550
a hypocritical term you mortals use.

304
00:22:01,010 --> 00:22:03,000
Lies, deceit,

305
00:22:03,720 --> 00:22:05,850
betrayal, and slander.

306
00:22:08,670 --> 00:22:11,620
That's what your so-called friends

307
00:22:11,670 --> 00:22:13,310
are capable of.

308
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:16,780
Is that really what you think?

309
00:22:18,190 --> 00:22:19,920
Then why

310
00:22:20,110 --> 00:22:22,570
are you still holding onto this rattle drum?

311
00:22:28,770 --> 00:22:29,570
Hey.

312
00:22:30,540 --> 00:22:31,150
Zhao Yuanzhou.

313
00:22:31,150 --> 00:22:32,150
Your umbrella.

314
00:22:33,090 --> 00:22:35,150
And that thing beside you.

315
00:22:42,870 --> 00:22:45,400
What game is Li Lun playing with you this time?

316
00:22:48,360 --> 00:22:50,120
A game to take my life.

317
00:22:56,070 --> 00:22:57,770
How much unresolved conflict

318
00:22:57,820 --> 00:22:59,640
is there between you and Li Lun?

319
00:23:02,520 --> 00:23:04,510
You've asked so many questions,

320
00:23:05,040 --> 00:23:06,230
now it's my turn.

321
00:23:09,870 --> 00:23:10,670
Go ahead.

322
00:23:12,060 --> 00:23:13,890
I have three questions.

323
00:23:15,210 --> 00:23:16,650
Answer them correctly,

324
00:23:17,080 --> 00:23:18,560
and I'll let you go.

325
00:23:20,180 --> 00:23:21,820
What if I get them wrong?

326
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:24,270
If you get them wrong,

327
00:23:27,080 --> 00:23:29,290
you'll die.

328
00:23:35,710 --> 00:23:37,570
This illusion hasn't broken yet.

329
00:23:37,590 --> 00:23:39,320
Is it because there's something

330
00:23:39,320 --> 00:23:40,580
you've forgotten

331
00:23:40,710 --> 00:23:42,590
but Li Lun wants you to remember?

332
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:46,180
Seems there really is something.

333
00:24:08,470 --> 00:24:10,030
Has the mortal world changed this much?

334
00:24:10,030 --> 00:24:12,040
Don't compare it to the Wilderness.

335
00:24:12,060 --> 00:24:13,360
In the Wilderness,

336
00:24:13,550 --> 00:24:16,620
a single cloud can drift in the sky for over two hundred years.

337
00:24:16,620 --> 00:24:17,980
In that case,

338
00:24:18,660 --> 00:24:20,720
the Wilderness is a bit boring, then.

339
00:24:23,710 --> 00:24:24,680
Sir,

340
00:24:24,700 --> 00:24:25,810
how much is this?

341
00:24:26,010 --> 00:24:28,660
Sir, this umbrella is only five coins.

342
00:24:33,390 --> 00:24:35,720
Ying Zhao only gave us five coins in total.

343
00:24:35,850 --> 00:24:37,510
We should spend it sparingly.

344
00:24:44,560 --> 00:24:45,630
It's raining.

345
00:24:47,260 --> 00:24:48,920
So this is called an umbrella.

346
00:24:51,830 --> 00:24:52,870
What is it for?

347
00:24:52,980 --> 00:24:54,510
To shield one from the rain.

348
00:24:54,760 --> 00:24:56,160
Why shield from the rain?

349
00:24:56,370 --> 00:24:57,730
Wind and rain,

350
00:24:57,760 --> 00:24:59,140
snow and frost,

351
00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:00,650
everything in this world

352
00:25:00,650 --> 00:25:02,180
follows the natural order.

353
00:25:02,510 --> 00:25:03,470
I, Li Lun,

354
00:25:03,830 --> 00:25:04,950
never hide

355
00:25:05,310 --> 00:25:06,580
or retreat.

356
00:25:08,030 --> 00:25:08,830
Fine.

357
00:25:12,560 --> 00:25:16,860
[Umbrella]

358
00:25:36,970 --> 00:25:38,620
First question,

359
00:25:40,510 --> 00:25:42,610
is it better to be human

360
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:45,320
or to be a demon?

361
00:25:45,670 --> 00:25:47,000
Being a demon is better.

362
00:25:47,390 --> 00:25:48,320
Being a demon...

363
00:25:48,920 --> 00:25:50,300
Wrong answer.

364
00:26:01,030 --> 00:26:01,990
Being human

365
00:26:04,070 --> 00:26:05,000
and being a demon

366
00:26:05,940 --> 00:26:06,740
both are good.

367
00:26:12,600 --> 00:26:14,080
You can only choose one.

368
00:26:16,920 --> 00:26:18,180
I don't need to choose,

369
00:26:19,680 --> 00:26:22,340
because the heavens have already chosen for me.

370
00:26:24,510 --> 00:26:25,110
Oh?

371
00:26:25,710 --> 00:26:26,980
I was born human,

372
00:26:27,970 --> 00:26:29,320
so I can only be human.

373
00:26:31,490 --> 00:26:35,020
In truth, both humans and demons have their own good qualities.

374
00:26:35,400 --> 00:26:36,660
No need to envy

375
00:26:37,140 --> 00:26:38,590
or resent each other.

376
00:26:39,800 --> 00:26:41,460
Mountains don't reject dust.

377
00:26:41,640 --> 00:26:43,370
Rivers don't refuse fullness.

378
00:26:43,680 --> 00:26:45,080
Everything in this world

379
00:26:45,560 --> 00:26:46,950
has its place.

380
00:26:47,700 --> 00:26:49,210
Whether human or demon,

381
00:26:49,470 --> 00:26:51,730
what's the difference in value or worth?

382
00:26:55,830 --> 00:26:58,950
The Baize Goddess truly has a way with words.

383
00:27:00,890 --> 00:27:04,640
Since you believe both humans and demons are good,

384
00:27:07,080 --> 00:27:09,280
then let's move on to the next question.

385
00:27:10,350 --> 00:27:12,460
Do you think humans are more evil,

386
00:27:14,330 --> 00:27:16,260
or demons?

387
00:27:18,510 --> 00:27:19,710
Demons are more evil.

388
00:27:29,910 --> 00:27:31,530
Why are demons so wicked?

389
00:27:33,980 --> 00:27:35,330
My father was a good man,

390
00:27:37,190 --> 00:27:38,930
yet he was killed by a demon.

391
00:27:42,590 --> 00:27:44,510
Demons act violently,

392
00:27:45,030 --> 00:27:46,960
without regard for consequences.

393
00:27:47,480 --> 00:27:49,300
But the cause of this

394
00:27:49,830 --> 00:27:50,630
was still because

395
00:27:50,630 --> 00:27:52,470
a demon's love turned to hate,

396
00:27:53,480 --> 00:27:54,790
seeking revenge,

397
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:58,040
which unfortunately implicated your father.

398
00:28:03,330 --> 00:28:05,750
Are you truly willing to follow me back to the Wilderness,

399
00:28:05,750 --> 00:28:07,610
and devote yourself to training?

400
00:28:08,080 --> 00:28:08,940
I am willing.

401
00:28:11,930 --> 00:28:13,890
Because I don't want anyone else

402
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:16,530
to lose their loved ones

403
00:28:17,080 --> 00:28:18,770
because of demons.

404
00:28:21,080 --> 00:28:23,150
Why did you stop speaking?

405
00:28:40,860 --> 00:28:43,290
Demons come in all shapes and forms,

406
00:28:44,670 --> 00:28:45,940
and their wickedness

407
00:28:46,110 --> 00:28:47,660
is often apparent.

408
00:28:48,790 --> 00:28:50,580
The bloodthirsty kill.

409
00:28:50,900 --> 00:28:52,620
The greedy plunder.

410
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:55,190
It's an obvious

411
00:28:55,390 --> 00:28:57,560
and blatant kind of evil.

412
00:28:58,910 --> 00:28:59,750
But humans

413
00:29:00,220 --> 00:29:02,120
each have a thousand facets.

414
00:29:02,390 --> 00:29:03,920
We are masters of disguise.

415
00:29:05,820 --> 00:29:07,040
If you're asking

416
00:29:07,640 --> 00:29:08,950
who is more wicked,

417
00:29:09,770 --> 00:29:11,000
then of course,

418
00:29:11,990 --> 00:29:14,030
it's the more overtly evil demons

419
00:29:14,050 --> 00:29:15,180
who are more wicked.

420
00:29:17,390 --> 00:29:19,280
But if you're asking

421
00:29:19,500 --> 00:29:21,860
which type of evil is more dangerous

422
00:29:22,030 --> 00:29:23,710
and insidious,

423
00:29:25,950 --> 00:29:27,310
then that's...

424
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:32,250
That's the next question.

425
00:29:41,080 --> 00:29:43,270
I quite like your answer.

426
00:29:45,580 --> 00:29:47,450
The final question.

427
00:29:50,500 --> 00:29:52,620
Between me and Zhao Yuanzhou,

428
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:56,550
who is stronger?

429
00:30:03,930 --> 00:30:06,800
Why did your question style suddenly change?

430
00:30:15,710 --> 00:30:17,070
Answer me.

431
00:30:23,350 --> 00:30:25,300
Zhao Yuanzhou is stronger.

432
00:30:30,730 --> 00:30:32,100
Zhao Yuanzhou

433
00:30:33,310 --> 00:30:35,740
has a broader mind than you.

434
00:30:38,890 --> 00:30:40,220
He is not narrow-minded

435
00:30:41,480 --> 00:30:42,870
nor extreme.

436
00:30:45,140 --> 00:30:47,340
But you, with your twisted intentions,

437
00:30:48,870 --> 00:30:50,890
will never surpass him.

438
00:31:08,820 --> 00:31:10,740
You understand him so well,

439
00:31:10,990 --> 00:31:12,830
and speak on his behalf.

440
00:31:14,300 --> 00:31:16,540
Don't you hate him?

441
00:31:17,370 --> 00:31:20,320
He did kill your master.

442
00:31:21,660 --> 00:31:23,870
You should be hating him like I do.

443
00:31:27,030 --> 00:31:29,860
We should seek revenge with him,

444
00:31:30,730 --> 00:31:31,720
shouldn't we?

445
00:31:37,300 --> 00:31:39,230
You say he's righteous.

446
00:31:42,320 --> 00:31:45,170
But he's only good at mimicking humanity.

447
00:31:46,970 --> 00:31:49,970
He's more hypocritical and deceitful than any human.

448
00:31:51,310 --> 00:31:52,810
To me,

449
00:31:53,270 --> 00:31:55,150
to Zhao Wan'er and to you,

450
00:31:56,420 --> 00:31:57,890
he's the same.

451
00:31:59,590 --> 00:32:01,580
Sooner or later,

452
00:32:03,080 --> 00:32:06,200
he will kill you just like he killed

453
00:32:07,790 --> 00:32:09,430
Zhao Wan'er.

454
00:32:14,350 --> 00:32:15,830
So,

455
00:32:18,060 --> 00:32:20,760
the one who should be suffering now

456
00:32:21,270 --> 00:32:22,230
is not me,

457
00:32:23,480 --> 00:32:25,030
and not you,

458
00:32:27,720 --> 00:32:29,530
but him.

459
00:33:05,420 --> 00:33:06,570
Li Lun.

460
00:33:08,300 --> 00:33:10,480
How many times have you been deceived?

461
00:33:11,800 --> 00:33:13,360
Why don't you learn from it?

462
00:33:37,870 --> 00:33:38,550
Jiu!

463
00:33:38,580 --> 00:33:39,980
Jiu!

464
00:34:13,840 --> 00:34:15,639
What are you doing, Great Demon?

465
00:34:17,520 --> 00:34:19,370
She's not Wen Xiao.

466
00:34:23,350 --> 00:34:23,909
Wen!

467
00:34:23,909 --> 00:34:24,719
Jiu!

468
00:34:44,280 --> 00:34:45,480
Jiu, are you okay?

469
00:34:45,510 --> 00:34:46,440
I'm fine.

470
00:34:46,469 --> 00:34:47,070
Great Demon.

471
00:34:47,070 --> 00:34:48,480
What's going on?

472
00:35:07,830 --> 00:35:08,760
Wen Xiao?

473
00:35:14,830 --> 00:35:15,770
Open.

474
00:35:19,330 --> 00:35:20,880
This cage

475
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:22,730
limits my magic.

476
00:35:22,950 --> 00:35:23,650
What?

477
00:35:27,740 --> 00:35:29,580
What is this cage?

478
00:35:36,200 --> 00:35:37,510
On this cage,

479
00:35:37,840 --> 00:35:40,480
there is a curse seal drawn with the blood of Zhu Jian.

480
00:35:40,480 --> 00:35:42,610
It's specially used to lock up demons.

481
00:35:43,500 --> 00:35:45,250
The demon inside this cage

482
00:35:46,500 --> 00:35:48,430
can't use any of its demonic power.

483
00:35:49,230 --> 00:35:50,380
What should we do?

484
00:35:56,490 --> 00:35:57,720
Go behind me.

485
00:36:21,400 --> 00:36:22,820
Zhao Yuanzhou.

486
00:36:23,840 --> 00:36:25,550
Long time no see.

487
00:36:27,610 --> 00:36:28,910
Where is Wen Xiao?

488
00:36:30,020 --> 00:36:32,300
The final challenge is not over yet.

489
00:36:32,950 --> 00:36:34,150
What's the rush?

490
00:36:35,630 --> 00:36:36,990
If you pass,

491
00:36:38,180 --> 00:36:39,950
I'll let you see her.

492
00:36:44,590 --> 00:36:45,270
No.

493
00:36:46,230 --> 00:36:47,720
She's not Wen Xiao.

494
00:37:14,550 --> 00:37:16,050
You still want to play?

495
00:37:16,190 --> 00:37:17,190
That's right.

496
00:37:19,550 --> 00:37:20,880
What do you want to play?

497
00:37:21,870 --> 00:37:23,070
This and that.

498
00:37:24,860 --> 00:37:26,410
Choose between the two.

499
00:37:36,110 --> 00:37:37,100
Let him go.

500
00:37:39,790 --> 00:37:41,230
In the first round, I planned to

501
00:37:41,230 --> 00:37:43,620
keep this demon here.

502
00:37:44,230 --> 00:37:46,720
I didn't expect you to not give up on him.

503
00:37:47,960 --> 00:37:49,770
Jiu is my friend.

504
00:37:50,470 --> 00:37:52,390
Even if I give up on myself,

505
00:37:53,110 --> 00:37:55,120
I won't give up on my friends.

506
00:37:56,170 --> 00:37:58,280
You won't give up on friends.

507
00:38:00,850 --> 00:38:02,620
You're lying again.

508
00:38:05,520 --> 00:38:06,850
Now,

509
00:38:07,460 --> 00:38:08,890
I want your life

510
00:38:09,560 --> 00:38:10,720
for his life.

511
00:38:11,540 --> 00:38:12,670
Are you willing?

512
00:38:19,570 --> 00:38:20,560
Yes.

513
00:38:23,400 --> 00:38:24,290
Zhao Yuanzhou.

514
00:38:25,290 --> 00:38:27,000
Don't listen to his nonsense.

515
00:38:27,920 --> 00:38:29,650
He is a liar.

516
00:38:30,720 --> 00:38:31,480
Jiu.

517
00:38:33,830 --> 00:38:37,230
Zhao Yuanzhou is the liar.

518
00:38:41,320 --> 00:38:43,420
This or that.

519
00:38:44,180 --> 00:38:45,590
Listen.

520
00:38:49,620 --> 00:38:51,220
Do you choose Bai Jiu

521
00:38:52,880 --> 00:38:54,520
or Zhuo Yichen?

522
00:38:56,150 --> 00:38:57,780
What for?

523
00:39:01,140 --> 00:39:03,200
Choose one to live,

524
00:39:04,720 --> 00:39:06,700
and the other one to die.

525
00:39:48,860 --> 00:39:50,540
Is it hard to choose?

526
00:39:51,830 --> 00:39:53,640
Bai Jiu is your friend.

527
00:39:54,830 --> 00:39:56,540
But Zhuo Yichen...

528
00:39:57,670 --> 00:40:00,160
is your enemy.

529
00:40:05,310 --> 00:40:07,870
M-M-Mr. Zhuo

530
00:40:08,640 --> 00:40:10,150
is not the enemy.

531
00:40:18,440 --> 00:40:20,230
After all these years,

532
00:40:22,010 --> 00:40:24,010
you still haven't grown up.

533
00:40:25,280 --> 00:40:28,180
You've really put in a lot of effort into

534
00:40:30,460 --> 00:40:33,390
building this illusion of the Demon Hunting Bureau.

535
00:40:33,880 --> 00:40:36,280
I just hope you don't forget

536
00:40:38,520 --> 00:40:41,340
how humans treat us.

537
00:40:52,030 --> 00:40:53,890
Luckily, you bought an umbrella.

538
00:40:59,470 --> 00:41:00,150
Listen.

539
00:41:03,590 --> 00:41:04,310
A demon.

540
00:41:13,470 --> 00:41:15,220
How could a normal clinic

541
00:41:15,550 --> 00:41:16,980
have a bunker?

542
00:41:24,830 --> 00:41:26,570
Such a strong smell of blood.

543
00:42:03,270 --> 00:42:04,930
The blood of Zhu Jian...

544
00:42:09,640 --> 00:42:10,620
Sir.

545
00:42:10,660 --> 00:42:12,240
Sir, save us...

546
00:42:12,360 --> 00:42:14,080
They captured us

547
00:42:14,100 --> 00:42:15,560
to drain our blood.

548
00:42:15,590 --> 00:42:16,960
But they won't let us die.

549
00:42:16,960 --> 00:42:18,920
Please save us.

550
00:42:18,940 --> 00:42:19,890
Sir..

551
00:42:20,570 --> 00:42:21,690
Save us.

552
00:42:21,720 --> 00:42:22,880
Save us!

553
00:42:22,900 --> 00:42:23,580
Sir!

554
00:42:23,610 --> 00:42:26,790
I don't want to stay here anymore.

555
00:42:26,810 --> 00:42:28,330
Save us.

556
00:42:28,360 --> 00:42:30,600
Save us!

557
00:42:30,650 --> 00:42:31,850
Sir!

558
00:42:32,560 --> 00:42:35,740
Please save us!

559
00:42:35,910 --> 00:42:37,550
Someone's coming.

560
00:42:38,220 --> 00:42:38,910
Save us!

561
00:42:38,910 --> 00:42:39,600
Let's go!

562
00:42:40,350 --> 00:42:41,390
Sir!

563
00:42:45,670 --> 00:42:46,970
It's been such a hard journey.

564
00:42:46,970 --> 00:42:48,430
I finally found the

565
00:42:48,430 --> 00:42:49,760
branch of the Ever-Burning Wood that he wants.

566
00:42:49,760 --> 00:42:50,730
It is said that

567
00:42:51,280 --> 00:42:53,360
this is the last piece of Ever-Burning Wood in the world.

568
00:42:53,360 --> 00:42:54,680
Watch it carefully.

569
00:43:00,070 --> 00:43:00,750
Who are you?

570
00:43:24,490 --> 00:43:25,590
Are you crazy?

571
00:43:26,170 --> 00:43:27,370
Why did you kill them?

572
00:43:44,320 --> 00:43:45,550
Come with me.

573
00:43:46,980 --> 00:43:48,780
I'll take you to the Wilderness.

574
00:44:00,870 --> 00:44:03,340
♫A thought in the vicissitudes of time♫

575
00:44:03,410 --> 00:44:07,470
♫Wait until regrets blow all over the desolate world♫

576
00:44:07,670 --> 00:44:09,830
♫The inscription is difficult to read♫

577
00:44:10,100 --> 00:44:13,760
♫Time wears away the vows♫

578
00:44:13,960 --> 00:44:16,400
♫Turning the world upside down♫

579
00:44:16,480 --> 00:44:21,130
♫Can't get the broken yesterday back♫

580
00:44:21,580 --> 00:44:27,190
♫How to turn back time?♫

581
00:44:27,280 --> 00:44:30,150
♫I'm willing to break through the cliff♫

582
00:44:30,210 --> 00:44:33,520
♫Turn into a white horse♫

583
00:44:33,900 --> 00:44:36,590
♫Crush all the struggles♫

584
00:44:36,850 --> 00:44:40,240
♫Let the suffering bloom♫

585
00:44:40,900 --> 00:44:44,180
♫Write about caring with ruthlessness♫

586
00:44:44,240 --> 00:44:47,390
♫Use a lifetime to remember a moment♫

587
00:44:47,500 --> 00:44:53,780
♫The greatness of vowing to live and die together♫
