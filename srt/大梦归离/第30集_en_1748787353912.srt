I'm sorry.

37
00:01:15,700 --> 00:01:17,700
I'm sorry.

38
00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:19,700
I'm sorry.

39
00:01:19,700 --> 00:01:21,700
I'm sorry.

40
00:01:21,700 --> 00:01:23,700
I'm sorry.

41
00:01:23,700 --> 00:01:25,700
I'm sorry.

42
00:01:25,700 --> 00:01:27,700
I'm sorry.

I'm sorry.

46
00:01:45,700 --> 00:01:47,700
You're really pitiful.

47
00:01:47,700 --> 00:01:51,700
You're the most lonely person in the world.

48
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:01,700
I'm sorry.

49
00:02:01,700 --> 00:02:03,700
I'm sorry.

00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:13,700
I'm sorry.

55
00:02:13,700 --> 00:02:15,700
I'm sorry.

56
00:02:15,700 --> 00:02:17,700
I'm sorry.

57
00:02:17,700 --> 00:02:19,700
I'm sorry.

58
00:02:19,700 --> 00:02:21,700
I'm sorry.

59
00:02:21,700 --> 00:02:23,700
I'm sorry.

60
00:02:23,700 --> 00:02:25,700
I'm sorry.

61
00:02:25,700 --> 00:02:27,700
I'm sorry.

62
00:02:27,700 --> 00:02:29,700
I'm sorry.

63
00:02:57,700 --> 00:02:59,700
You're the only one who's here.

64
00:02:59,700 --> 00:03:01,700
I understand.

65
00:03:01,700 --> 00:03:03,700
I know.

66
00:03:03,700 --> 00:03:05,700
I'm sorry.

67
00:03:05,700 --> 00:03:07,700
I'm sorry.

68
00:03:07,700 --> 00:03:09,700
I'm sorry.

69
00:03:09,700 --> 00:03:11,700
I didn't know you were so lonely.

70
00:03:11,700 --> 00:03:13,700
You're the only one who's here.

71
00:03:13,700 --> 00:03:15,700
You're the only one watching.

72
00:03:15,700 --> 00:03:17,700
I'm sorry.

73
00:03:17,700 --> 00:03:19,700
You're really pitiful.

74
00:03:21,700 --> 00:03:23,700
I'm sorry.

75
00:03:23,700 --> 00:03:25,700
I'm sorry.

76
00:03:25,700 --> 00:03:27,460
You aren't regretting anymore, are you?

77
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:30,420
Not anymore.

78
00:03:30,900 --> 00:03:33,140
This current situation

79
00:03:33,140 --> 00:03:35,180
is helping me pay of 50 express Alone.

80
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:38,160
It's no longer easy.

81
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:45,120
Indeed

82
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:48,900
there are some other things

83
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:51,500
that are not as Budget,

84
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:55,560
the Lu's life is forever.

85
00:03:55,700 --> 00:03:58,700
But in the end, it's only a one-year-old child.

86
00:03:59,700 --> 00:04:01,700
Is it interesting?

87
00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:05,700
I've been living with people for a long time.

88
00:04:06,700 --> 00:04:11,700
Even if I speak, I can't get used to it.

89
00:04:12,700 --> 00:04:14,700
Life is like a flag.

90
00:04:15,700 --> 00:04:17,700
If I start, I'll be wrong.

91
00:04:17,700 --> 00:04:19,700
Life is like a flag.

92
00:04:22,700 --> 00:04:24,700
But I don't want to be a person.

93
00:04:26,700 --> 00:04:29,700
I want to be someone.

94
00:04:31,700 --> 00:04:32,700
It's you.

95
00:04:33,700 --> 00:04:37,700
There must be a book between you and me.

96
00:04:38,700 --> 00:04:43,700
One person can still be a king.

97
00:04:48,700 --> 00:04:49,700
A king.

98
00:04:50,700 --> 00:04:54,700
You said it yourself.

99
00:05:02,700 --> 00:05:04,700
Just keep it a secret.

100
00:05:04,700 --> 00:05:06,700
I don't mind you getting close to me.

101
00:05:06,700 --> 00:05:08,700
You still have a chance to make up for it.

102
00:05:08,700 --> 00:05:10,700
I'm sorry.

103
00:05:13,700 --> 00:05:14,700
Rourou Kan.

104
00:05:17,700 --> 00:05:19,700
Leave Baijiu.

105
00:05:23,700 --> 00:05:25,700
Let him live.

106
00:05:32,700 --> 00:05:33,700
Master.

107
00:05:33,700 --> 00:05:34,700
Master.

108
00:05:38,700 --> 00:05:40,700
Your peace solution

109
00:05:42,700 --> 00:05:44,700
is to let me die.

110
00:05:47,700 --> 00:05:49,700
He's your friend.

111
00:05:52,700 --> 00:05:57,700
I used to be your friend.

112
00:06:03,700 --> 00:06:04,700
Master.

113
00:06:05,700 --> 00:06:06,700
Master.

114
00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:08,700
Master.

115
00:06:09,700 --> 00:06:10,700
Master.

116
00:06:11,700 --> 00:06:12,700
Master.

117
00:06:13,700 --> 00:06:14,700
Master.

118
00:06:15,700 --> 00:06:16,700
Master.

119
00:06:17,700 --> 00:06:18,700
Master.

120
00:06:19,700 --> 00:06:20,700
Master.

121
00:06:21,700 --> 00:06:22,700
Master.

122
00:06:23,700 --> 00:06:24,700
Master.

123
00:06:25,700 --> 00:06:26,700
Master.

124
00:06:27,700 --> 00:06:28,700
Master.

125
00:06:29,700 --> 00:06:30,700
Master.

126
00:06:31,700 --> 00:06:32,700
Master.

127
00:06:34,700 --> 00:06:35,700
Master.

128
00:06:44,700 --> 00:06:46,700
Zhang Yincheng, what's wrong?

129
00:06:46,700 --> 00:06:47,700
Da Yao.

130
00:06:53,700 --> 00:06:54,700
Da Yao.

131
00:06:55,700 --> 00:06:57,700
She's now in the Demon Realm.

132
00:06:58,700 --> 00:07:01,700
And the mortal is no longer different.

133
00:07:03,700 --> 00:07:07,700
You're doing this for me?

134
00:07:08,700 --> 00:07:09,700
No.

135
00:07:11,700 --> 00:07:13,700
I'm doing this for Baijiu.

136
00:07:14,700 --> 00:07:15,700
Zhang Yincheng.

137
00:07:16,700 --> 00:07:19,700
You're making yourself so miserable.

138
00:07:20,700 --> 00:07:22,700
You're not worthy of being my opponent.

139
00:07:24,700 --> 00:07:25,700
Lilo.

140
00:07:26,700 --> 00:07:29,700
I'm your opponent.

141
00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:31,700
Stop.

142
00:07:34,700 --> 00:07:35,700
Stop.

143
00:07:39,700 --> 00:07:40,700
Zhang Yincheng.

144
00:07:41,700 --> 00:07:43,700
Master Baiye, it's your turn.

145
00:07:43,700 --> 00:07:44,700
Master.

146
00:07:44,700 --> 00:07:45,700
I'll protect you.

147
00:07:45,700 --> 00:07:46,700
I'll protect you.

148
00:08:02,700 --> 00:08:05,700
I'll kill myself.

149
00:08:15,700 --> 00:08:16,700
Master.

150
00:08:38,700 --> 00:08:39,700
Hong.

151
00:08:45,700 --> 00:08:46,700
Master.

152
00:09:07,700 --> 00:09:09,700
I'm sure you're better than Yijian.

153
00:09:11,700 --> 00:09:12,700
But you dare not kill me.

154
00:09:12,700 --> 00:09:17,700
You'll lose if you kill me.

155
00:09:17,700 --> 00:09:18,700
I'll kill myself.

156
00:09:42,700 --> 00:09:44,700
Wenxiang, your clan is not over yet.

157
00:09:44,700 --> 00:09:45,700
Don't force it.

158
00:09:47,700 --> 00:09:48,700
I'll kill myself.

159
00:10:08,700 --> 00:10:09,700
Wenxiang.

160
00:10:14,700 --> 00:10:15,700
You must control her.

161
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:20,700
I'll make Xiaozhuo and Mezhuo's LiLi be more powerful.

162
00:10:20,700 --> 00:10:22,700
If we don't kill her,

163
00:10:22,700 --> 00:10:25,700
Lilo and Xiaojiu will be more powerful.

164
00:10:47,700 --> 00:10:48,700
Master.

165
00:11:12,700 --> 00:11:13,700
Wenxiang.

166
00:11:17,700 --> 00:11:18,700
Master.

167
00:11:47,700 --> 00:11:48,700
Master.

168
00:12:17,700 --> 00:12:19,700
I'm afraid I'll be there.

169
00:12:19,700 --> 00:12:20,700
Go.

170
00:12:23,700 --> 00:12:24,700
Xiao.

171
00:12:26,700 --> 00:12:27,700
Xiaojiu.

172
00:12:28,700 --> 00:12:29,700
Xiaojiu.

173
00:12:48,700 --> 00:12:51,700
I'm a little bit used to it.

174
00:13:13,700 --> 00:13:14,700
Master.

175
00:13:14,700 --> 00:13:16,700
Master.

176
00:13:44,700 --> 00:13:45,700
Master.

177
00:13:54,700 --> 00:13:55,700
Master.

178
00:13:58,700 --> 00:14:00,700
I'll give you my soul.

179
00:14:03,700 --> 00:14:05,700
You'll give me your bad tree root.

180
00:14:08,700 --> 00:14:09,700
The only cure I've ever had

181
00:14:11,700 --> 00:14:13,700
is the enemy.

182
00:14:15,700 --> 00:14:18,700
The enemy of State Zhongkotsu .

183
00:14:18,700 --> 00:14:20,700
Feibaici is your life.

184
00:14:20,700 --> 00:14:21,700
If you use it

185
00:14:21,700 --> 00:14:23,700
to pull Rongностью

186
00:14:23,700 --> 00:14:25,700
into yourcritic目

187
00:14:26,700 --> 00:14:28,700
to remove you

188
00:14:29,700 --> 00:14:31,700
you'll be able to overwhelm her continuously.

189
00:14:36,700 --> 00:14:38,700
Zhao Yunzhou refuses to let you slip away.

190
00:14:39,700 --> 00:14:42,700
This is her only wish.

191
00:14:42,700 --> 00:14:51,120
He's really a child-loving mother인 a child-loving father!

192
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,500
Controller...

193
00:14:58,700 --> 00:15:01,200
I cannot do anything, not me!

194
00:15:06,620 --> 00:15:09,500
How has confronted such a immaturehill?

195
00:15:39,500 --> 00:15:41,500
I made it.

196
00:15:53,500 --> 00:15:55,500
Ying Lei, Xiao Jiu is fine.

197
00:15:55,500 --> 00:15:56,500
Give her to me.

198
00:16:09,500 --> 00:16:11,500
The Little Girl

199
00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:22,500
Little girl, the place where the world is quiet and the world is clear and clear.

200
00:16:22,500 --> 00:16:24,500
Who is the girl?

201
00:16:24,500 --> 00:16:26,500
I think you're the one who's going to take the medicine.

202
00:16:27,500 --> 00:16:29,500
Why do you want to call her Bai Jiu?

203
00:16:29,500 --> 00:16:32,500
Why don't you call her Huang Jiu or Hua Diao?

204
00:16:39,500 --> 00:16:42,500
Little girl.

205
00:17:09,500 --> 00:17:11,500
Little girl.

206
00:17:20,500 --> 00:17:22,500
Ying Lei.

207
00:17:30,500 --> 00:17:32,500
Little girl.

208
00:17:35,500 --> 00:17:37,500
Little girl.

209
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:40,500
It's been eight days.

210
00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:47,500
This time, it's me.

211
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:49,500
It's me who saved her.

212
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:03,500
Lord Shan Shan.

213
00:18:07,500 --> 00:18:09,500
You're amazing.

214
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:18,500
I like...

215
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:23,500
Lord Ding Xiao Luo.

216
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:34,500
I'm amazing.

217
00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:39,500
Xiao Jiu, you're amazing.

218
00:18:39,500 --> 00:18:41,500
What about me?

219
00:18:41,500 --> 00:18:43,500
Shouldn't you praise me?

220
00:18:45,500 --> 00:18:48,500
Lord Ding Lei, you're amazing too.

221
00:19:03,500 --> 00:19:05,500
You're better than me.

222
00:19:08,500 --> 00:19:11,500
You're the hero of Xiao Jiu.

223
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:31,500
You're the best and the best teacher I've ever seen.

224
00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:38,500
The best teacher is also the best chef.

225
00:20:02,500 --> 00:20:04,500
Xiao Jiu.

226
00:20:05,500 --> 00:20:09,500
You'll definitely become the best doctor in the world.

227
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:12,500
Come on.

228
00:20:18,500 --> 00:20:20,500
Xiao Jiu.

229
00:20:22,500 --> 00:20:29,500
You'll definitely be the best doctor in the world.

230
00:20:31,500 --> 00:20:36,500
The best doctor.

231
00:20:43,500 --> 00:20:45,500
Sir, sir.

232
00:20:46,500 --> 00:20:48,500
Little girl.

233
00:20:48,500 --> 00:20:50,500
Ying Lei.

234
00:20:50,500 --> 00:20:52,500
Ying Lei, I'm fine.

235
00:20:52,500 --> 00:20:54,500
Come on.

236
00:21:01,500 --> 00:21:03,500
Xiao Jiu.

237
00:21:14,500 --> 00:21:16,500
Xiao Jiu.

238
00:21:24,500 --> 00:21:26,500
I want to...

239
00:21:27,500 --> 00:21:29,500
Xiao Jiu.

240
00:21:29,500 --> 00:21:38,500
I'm scared.

241
00:21:56,500 --> 00:21:58,500
Xiao Jiu.

242
00:21:58,500 --> 00:22:00,500
Xiao Jiu.

243
00:22:00,500 --> 00:22:02,500
Xiao Jiu.

244
00:22:02,500 --> 00:22:04,500
Xiao Jiu.

245
00:22:04,500 --> 00:22:06,500
Xiao Jiu.

246
00:22:06,500 --> 00:22:08,500
Xiao Jiu.

247
00:22:08,500 --> 00:22:10,500
Xiao Jiu.

248
00:22:10,500 --> 00:22:12,500
Xiao Jiu.

249
00:22:12,500 --> 00:22:14,500
Xiao Jiu.

250
00:22:14,500 --> 00:22:16,500
Xiao Jiu.

251
00:22:16,500 --> 00:22:18,500
Xiao Jiu.

252
00:22:18,500 --> 00:22:20,500
Xiao Jiu.

253
00:22:20,500 --> 00:22:22,500
Xiao Jiu.

254
00:22:22,500 --> 00:22:24,500
Xiao Jiu.

255
00:22:24,500 --> 00:22:26,500
Xiao Jiu.

256
00:22:26,500 --> 00:22:28,500
Xiao Jiu.

257
00:22:28,500 --> 00:22:30,500
Xiao Jiu.

258
00:22:30,500 --> 00:22:32,500
Xiao Jiu.

259
00:22:32,500 --> 00:22:34,500
Xiao Jiu.

260
00:22:34,500 --> 00:22:36,500
Xiao Jiu.

261
00:22:36,500 --> 00:22:38,500
Xiao Jiu.

262
00:22:38,500 --> 00:22:40,500
Xiao Jiu.

263
00:22:40,500 --> 00:22:42,500
Xiao Jiu.

264
00:22:42,500 --> 00:22:44,500
Xiao Jiu.

265
00:22:44,500 --> 00:22:46,500
Xiao Jiu.

266
00:22:46,500 --> 00:22:48,500
Xiao Jiu.

267
00:22:48,500 --> 00:22:50,500
Xiao Jiu.

268
00:22:50,500 --> 00:22:52,500
Xiao Jiu.

269
00:22:52,500 --> 00:22:54,500
Xiao Jiu.

270
00:22:54,500 --> 00:22:56,500
Xiao Jiu.

271
00:22:56,500 --> 00:22:58,500
Xiao Jiu.

272
00:22:58,500 --> 00:23:00,500
Xiao Jiu.

273
00:23:00,500 --> 00:23:02,500
Xiao Jiu.

274
00:23:02,500 --> 00:23:04,500
Xiao Jiu.

275
00:23:04,500 --> 00:23:06,500
Xiao Jiu.

276
00:23:06,500 --> 00:23:08,500
Xiao Jiu.

277
00:23:08,500 --> 00:23:10,500
Xiao Jiu.

278
00:23:10,500 --> 00:23:12,500
Xiao Jiu.

279
00:23:12,500 --> 00:23:14,500
Xiao Jiu.

280
00:23:14,500 --> 00:23:16,500
Xiao Jiu.

281
00:23:16,500 --> 00:23:18,500
Xiao Jiu.

282
00:23:18,500 --> 00:23:20,500
Xiao Jiu.

283
00:23:20,500 --> 00:23:22,500
Xiao Jiu.

284
00:23:22,500 --> 00:23:24,500
Xiao Jiu.

285
00:23:24,500 --> 00:23:26,500
Xiao Jiu.

286
00:23:26,500 --> 00:23:28,500
Xiao Jiu.

287
00:23:28,500 --> 00:23:30,500
Xiao Jiu.

288
00:23:30,500 --> 00:23:32,500
Xiao Jiu.

289
00:23:32,500 --> 00:23:34,500
Xiao Jiu.

290
00:23:34,500 --> 00:23:36,500
Xiao Jiu.

291
00:23:36,500 --> 00:23:38,500
Xiao Jiu.

292
00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:40,500
Xiao Jiu.

293
00:23:40,500 --> 00:23:42,500
Xiao Jiu.

294
00:23:42,500 --> 00:23:44,500
Xiao Jiu.

295
00:23:44,500 --> 00:23:46,500
Xiao Jiu.

296
00:23:46,500 --> 00:23:48,500
Xiao Jiu.

297
00:23:48,500 --> 00:23:50,500
Xiao Jiu.

298
00:24:18,500 --> 00:24:20,500
Xiao Jiu.

299
00:24:22,500 --> 00:24:24,500
Mom.

300
00:24:32,500 --> 00:24:34,500
Mom.

301
00:24:34,500 --> 00:24:36,500
Mom.

302
00:24:36,500 --> 00:24:38,500
I'm sorry.

303
00:24:40,500 --> 00:24:42,500
I've been looking after you for a long time.

304
00:24:42,500 --> 00:24:44,500
Mom.

305
00:24:46,500 --> 00:24:48,500
Mom.

306
00:25:06,500 --> 00:25:08,500
It's good to be with you.

307
00:25:12,500 --> 00:25:14,500
Mom.

308
00:25:14,500 --> 00:25:16,500
Mom.

309
00:25:16,500 --> 00:25:18,500
Mom.

310
00:25:18,500 --> 00:25:20,500
Mom.

311
00:25:20,500 --> 00:25:22,500
Mom.

312
00:25:22,500 --> 00:25:24,500
Mom.

313
00:25:24,500 --> 00:25:26,500
Mom.

314
00:25:26,500 --> 00:25:28,500
Tell her,

315
00:25:28,500 --> 00:25:30,500
I'll take it for you.

316
00:25:30,500 --> 00:25:32,500
Tell her.

317
00:25:32,500 --> 00:25:34,500
Tell her.

318
00:25:34,500 --> 00:25:36,500
Tell her.

319
00:25:36,500 --> 00:25:38,500
This time,

320
00:25:38,500 --> 00:25:40,500
I'll take it.

321
00:25:40,500 --> 00:25:46,540
alone.

322
00:25:46,540 --> 00:25:58,220
I am that person.

323
00:25:58,220 --> 00:26:00,220
Why didn't you tell us?

324
00:26:00,220 --> 00:26:02,220
After you used the impure pearl,

325
00:26:02,220 --> 00:26:04,220
you have become a demon.

326
00:26:05,220 --> 00:26:08,220
Didn't Shoyu say that there is a difference?

327
00:26:10,220 --> 00:26:12,220
This war must not be fought.

328
00:26:13,220 --> 00:26:15,220
People will not even want to die for this.

329
00:26:16,220 --> 00:26:19,220
I will just let this demon go.

330
00:26:20,220 --> 00:26:22,220
But you are not even as good as a mortal.

331
00:26:23,220 --> 00:26:25,220
You are not even as good as a mortal.

332
00:26:25,220 --> 00:26:27,220
You are not even as good as a mortal.

333
00:26:28,220 --> 00:26:31,220
How can you be so weak as a normal person?

334
00:26:32,220 --> 00:26:33,220
Look, look.

335
00:26:34,220 --> 00:26:38,220
The reason I don't want to tell you is that I don't want to see you like this.

336
00:26:39,220 --> 00:26:41,220
The Ice Clan is always a war god.

337
00:26:42,220 --> 00:26:44,220
But your eyes are so far away.

338
00:26:45,220 --> 00:26:49,220
If the Ice Clan sees you, they will kill you.

339
00:26:50,220 --> 00:26:51,220
What are you talking about?

340
00:26:52,220 --> 00:26:57,220
It's strange that you still listen to your mom.

341
00:27:11,220 --> 00:27:12,220
Let's go.

342
00:27:51,220 --> 00:27:52,220
Let's go.

343
00:28:02,220 --> 00:28:03,220
Yvai.

344
00:28:05,220 --> 00:28:06,220
Yvai.

345
00:28:07,220 --> 00:28:08,220
Yvai.

346
00:28:16,220 --> 00:28:17,220
Yvai.

347
00:28:19,220 --> 00:28:20,220
Yvai.

348
00:28:21,220 --> 00:28:22,220
Yvai.

349
00:28:23,220 --> 00:28:24,220
Yvai.

350
00:28:29,220 --> 00:28:30,220
Yvai.

351
00:28:35,220 --> 00:28:36,220
Yvai.

352
00:28:39,220 --> 00:28:40,220
Yvai.

353
00:28:40,220 --> 00:28:41,220
Yvai.

354
00:28:44,220 --> 00:28:45,220
Xiaojiao.

355
00:28:51,220 --> 00:28:52,220
Xiaojiao.

356
00:29:22,220 --> 00:29:23,220
Little Nine.

357
00:29:24,620 --> 00:29:26,220
You cry as you want to cry.

358
00:29:26,660 --> 00:29:27,460
I carry that on you.

359
00:29:30,220 --> 00:29:34,220
The eyes are not related to the age and the strength.

360
00:29:35,940 --> 00:29:45,000
They are closely

361
00:29:46,900 --> 00:29:48,260
in our hearts,

362
00:29:48,260 --> 00:29:50,260
But it's related to our hearts.

363
00:29:51,760 --> 00:29:53,260
People's hearts are soft.

364
00:29:55,260 --> 00:29:56,260
Soft things

365
00:29:57,260 --> 00:30:01,260
always have the pain of being cold and hard to handle.

366
00:30:02,260 --> 00:30:03,260
Death

367
00:30:04,260 --> 00:30:08,260
is the most hard and cold thing in this world.

368
00:30:12,260 --> 00:30:14,260
This is the thing that should lead me to you.

369
00:30:16,260 --> 00:30:17,260
I brought it.

370
00:30:18,260 --> 00:30:20,260
It's the one that you left for me.

371
00:30:30,760 --> 00:30:33,760
It looks like a new person's old man.

372
00:30:36,760 --> 00:30:39,260
It's still the new person's old man that my mom made.

373
00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:41,260
New person's old man?

374
00:30:42,260 --> 00:30:43,260
I remember.

375
00:30:44,260 --> 00:30:46,260
This little chef

376
00:30:47,260 --> 00:30:49,260
is really a fool.

377
00:30:50,260 --> 00:30:52,260
No one can be the one who makes the new person's old man

378
00:30:52,260 --> 00:30:53,260
and makes the blanket.

379
00:30:53,260 --> 00:30:55,260
It will be broken in two days.

380
00:31:14,260 --> 00:31:15,260
Ying Leyan.

381
00:31:16,260 --> 00:31:18,260
Are you making the new person's old man again?

382
00:31:18,760 --> 00:31:19,260
No.

383
00:31:19,760 --> 00:31:22,260
It's the new person's old man.

384
00:31:23,260 --> 00:31:24,260
Silly kid.

385
00:31:24,760 --> 00:31:27,260
You make so much and it will be broken.

386
00:31:28,260 --> 00:31:30,260
Then you can just say it.

387
00:31:30,260 --> 00:31:32,260
I understand everything.

388
00:31:32,760 --> 00:31:34,760
No matter you always scold me.

389
00:31:35,260 --> 00:31:38,260
You said that you used these hair bands in an important place.

390
00:31:38,760 --> 00:31:40,260
Who said it's not important?

391
00:31:40,260 --> 00:31:41,260
It's very important.

392
00:31:43,760 --> 00:31:46,760
I don't understand why I want to be a chef.

393
00:31:47,260 --> 00:31:49,260
It's because he's a person.

394
00:31:50,260 --> 00:31:52,260
Every time I like the most,

395
00:31:52,260 --> 00:31:55,260
I want to be with someone who cares about me the most.

396
00:31:55,260 --> 00:31:56,260
Mom,

397
00:31:56,760 --> 00:31:57,760
brother,

398
00:31:57,760 --> 00:31:58,760
lover,

399
00:31:59,760 --> 00:32:00,760
and friend.

400
00:32:01,760 --> 00:32:03,260
I'm the one who really cares about you.

401
00:32:03,760 --> 00:32:05,760
That's why I always ask you to make the same dish.

402
00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:06,760
I heard that

403
00:32:07,260 --> 00:32:08,260
all the ingredients

404
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:10,260
can be made into one dish.

405
00:32:10,260 --> 00:32:11,260
But

406
00:32:12,260 --> 00:32:13,260
it can also hold your stomach.

407
00:32:14,260 --> 00:32:15,760
It can also hold your heart.

408
00:32:16,760 --> 00:32:18,760
When you're in a trance,

409
00:32:19,760 --> 00:32:21,260
you always think of going home.

410
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:22,760
When he's back,

411
00:32:22,760 --> 00:32:24,260
when he was little,

412
00:32:24,260 --> 00:32:26,260
Mom would like to be the new person she knows.

413
00:32:27,260 --> 00:32:28,760
She would be very happy.

414
00:32:38,260 --> 00:32:39,760
Then give it to her yourself.

415
00:32:40,260 --> 00:32:41,260
Why do you give it to me?

416
00:33:10,260 --> 00:33:12,260
The more I'm calm,

417
00:33:12,260 --> 00:33:15,260
the more I'm in the dream.

418
00:33:19,260 --> 00:33:21,260
I don't listen to my aunt talk,

419
00:33:22,260 --> 00:33:24,260
but I also have a very good saying.

420
00:33:26,260 --> 00:33:27,260
Ying Lei,

421
00:33:28,260 --> 00:33:31,260
if you want to be the best chef in the world,

422
00:33:31,260 --> 00:33:33,260
you have to know all the different tastes.

423
00:33:34,260 --> 00:33:37,260
There are only two places in human's body

424
00:33:37,260 --> 00:33:40,260
that can be tasted.

425
00:33:41,260 --> 00:33:42,260
One is the tongue,

426
00:33:43,260 --> 00:33:48,260
one is the heart.

427
00:34:08,260 --> 00:34:09,260
Sister Pei,

428
00:34:10,260 --> 00:34:13,260
are you feeling sad for Ying Lei?

429
00:34:15,260 --> 00:34:16,260
I'm not sad.

430
00:34:19,260 --> 00:34:20,260
It's my own fault.

431
00:34:23,260 --> 00:34:24,260
If I can be stronger,

432
00:34:26,260 --> 00:34:27,260
more powerful,

433
00:34:28,260 --> 00:34:30,260
maybe Ying Lei won't sacrifice himself.

434
00:34:32,260 --> 00:34:34,260
I'm also a mortal.

435
00:34:34,260 --> 00:34:36,260
Xiao Chu is also a mortal.

436
00:34:38,260 --> 00:34:42,260
But we are all irreplaceable.

437
00:34:45,260 --> 00:34:47,260
You are a white goddess.

438
00:34:48,260 --> 00:34:50,260
Lord Zhuang is a soldier.

439
00:34:50,260 --> 00:34:52,260
You only have me.

440
00:34:54,260 --> 00:34:56,260
A useless mortal.

441
00:34:57,260 --> 00:34:59,260
I can't save Xiao Chu.

442
00:34:59,260 --> 00:35:01,260
I can't save Ying Lei.

443
00:35:11,260 --> 00:35:13,260
Now you have to protect me

444
00:35:15,260 --> 00:35:17,260
from my brother.

445
00:35:19,260 --> 00:35:21,260
If it wasn't for you,

446
00:35:22,260 --> 00:35:23,260
I would have died long ago.

447
00:35:24,260 --> 00:35:26,260
No one can protect me.

448
00:35:27,260 --> 00:35:28,260
If I was so strong,

449
00:35:29,260 --> 00:35:31,260
he would need us.

450
00:35:33,260 --> 00:35:35,260
He wouldn't need me.

451
00:35:38,260 --> 00:35:39,260
But I need you.

452
00:35:57,260 --> 00:35:59,260
Before I know how to protect others,

453
00:36:00,260 --> 00:36:02,260
I need to learn to protect myself first.

454
00:36:04,260 --> 00:36:05,260
Do you understand?

455
00:36:06,260 --> 00:36:08,260
I need to protect Xiao Chu.

456
00:36:27,260 --> 00:36:29,260
Maybe after this,

457
00:36:30,260 --> 00:36:31,260
I...

458
00:36:31,260 --> 00:36:32,260
Xiao Chu,

459
00:36:33,260 --> 00:36:34,260
what did you say?

460
00:36:38,260 --> 00:36:39,260
I said you are a great doctor.

461
00:36:40,260 --> 00:36:41,260
You need to know how to protect

462
00:36:42,260 --> 00:36:45,260
and take care of your friends.

463
00:36:46,260 --> 00:36:47,260
Of course.

464
00:36:48,260 --> 00:36:50,260
I'm confident about this.

465
00:36:56,260 --> 00:36:58,260
Especially when you ask my sister,

466
00:37:01,260 --> 00:37:03,260
she is not well.

467
00:37:05,260 --> 00:37:07,260
She is always sick.

468
00:37:11,260 --> 00:37:13,260
You need to take care of her.

469
00:37:15,260 --> 00:37:16,260
As for Lord Pei,

470
00:37:17,260 --> 00:37:19,260
she can be alone,

471
00:37:22,260 --> 00:37:24,260
but she will be strong.

472
00:37:26,260 --> 00:37:27,260
She will be self-sacrificed.

473
00:37:30,260 --> 00:37:31,260
And Zhao Yuncheng.

474
00:37:32,260 --> 00:37:33,260
Wait.

475
00:37:34,260 --> 00:37:35,260
Xiao Chu.

476
00:37:38,260 --> 00:37:39,260
How do you feel

477
00:37:39,260 --> 00:37:40,260
that something is wrong with you?

478
00:37:42,260 --> 00:37:43,260
Maybe

479
00:37:47,260 --> 00:37:48,260
I should

480
00:37:51,260 --> 00:37:52,260
take more care of you

481
00:37:53,260 --> 00:37:54,260
after I leave.

482
00:37:57,260 --> 00:37:58,260
No.

483
00:38:00,260 --> 00:38:01,260
Do you not like

484
00:38:02,260 --> 00:38:03,260
the venom of Gu prochainSur?

485
00:38:05,260 --> 00:38:06,260
She has the hemiplegia.

486
00:38:09,260 --> 00:38:10,260
It won't be treated into my own blood.

487
00:38:12,260 --> 00:38:13,260
Nobody will

488
00:38:13,260 --> 00:38:15,260
spare their ability

489
00:38:15,260 --> 00:38:16,020
to use poison

490
00:38:17,260 --> 00:38:18,260
for their hands.

491
00:38:23,260 --> 00:38:24,260
She is right.

492
00:38:26,260 --> 00:38:29,000
But what is Madame Yuan talking about?

493
00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:30,280
Nothing.

494
00:38:30,680 --> 00:38:33,780
I've settled grades with

495
00:38:33,780 --> 00:38:36,820
a certain female teacher.

496
00:38:38,480 --> 00:38:42,180
Is it all right if I drop by?

497
00:38:43,960 --> 00:38:45,660
My students can only understand

498
00:38:48,820 --> 00:38:52,260
theirlanagaining the way they can find Die.

499
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:54,440
I know that.

500
00:38:54,440 --> 00:38:56,440
I understand.

501
00:38:56,440 --> 00:38:58,440
But Wen Xiao

502
00:38:58,440 --> 00:39:01,440
will not let you do this.

503
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:28,440
Not to share

504
00:39:30,600 --> 00:39:31,960
Let's go.

505
00:39:31,960 --> 00:39:34,640
Love is less than half

506
00:39:35,240 --> 00:39:37,600
Why should time span

507
00:39:40,600 --> 00:39:43,360
So cold it has to disobey

508
00:39:43,360 --> 00:39:46,000
Cold is cold

509
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:47,480
Wometry to the sun

510
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:50,800
Don't want to feel together

511
00:39:51,360 --> 00:39:53,760
Who goes on to direct the atheist

512
00:40:23,760 --> 00:40:25,760
I'm not sure if I can do it.

513
00:40:25,760 --> 00:40:27,760
I'm not sure if I can do it.

514
00:40:27,760 --> 00:40:29,760
I'm not sure if I can do it.

515
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:31,760
I'm not sure if I can do it.

516
00:40:31,760 --> 00:40:33,760
I'm not sure if I can do it.

517
00:40:33,760 --> 00:40:35,760
I'm not sure if I can do it.

518
00:40:35,760 --> 00:40:37,760
I'm not sure if I can do it.

519
00:40:37,760 --> 00:40:39,760
I'm not sure if I can do it.

520
00:40:39,760 --> 00:40:41,760
I'm not sure if I can do it.

521
00:40:41,760 --> 00:40:43,760
I'm not sure if I can do it.

522
00:40:43,760 --> 00:40:45,760
I'm not sure if I can do it.

523
00:40:45,760 --> 00:40:47,760
I'm not sure if I can do it.

524
00:40:47,760 --> 00:40:49,760
I'm not sure if I can do it.

525
00:40:49,760 --> 00:40:51,760
I'm not sure if I can do it.

526
00:40:51,760 --> 00:40:53,760
I'm not sure if I can do it.

527
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:55,760
I'm not sure if I can do it.

528
00:40:55,760 --> 00:40:57,760
I'm not sure if I can do it.

529
00:40:57,760 --> 00:40:59,760
I'm not sure if I can do it.

530
00:40:59,760 --> 00:41:01,760
I'm not sure if I can do it.

531
00:41:01,760 --> 00:41:03,760
I'm not sure if I can do it.

532
00:41:03,760 --> 00:41:05,760
I'm not sure if I can do it.

533
00:41:05,760 --> 00:41:07,760
I'm not sure if I can do it.

534
00:41:07,760 --> 00:41:09,760
I'm not sure if I can do it.

535
00:41:09,760 --> 00:41:11,760
I'm not sure if I can do it.

536
00:41:11,760 --> 00:41:13,760
I'm not sure if I can do it.

537
00:41:13,760 --> 00:41:15,760
I'm not sure if I can do it.

538
00:41:15,760 --> 00:41:17,760
I'm not sure if I can do it.

539
00:41:17,760 --> 00:41:19,760
I'm not sure if I can do it.

540
00:41:19,760 --> 00:41:21,760
I'm not sure if I can do it.

00:41:21,760 --> 00:41:23,760
I'm not sure if I can do it.

I'm not sure if I can do it.

I'm not sure if I can do it.

I'm not sure if I can do it.

00:41:29,760 --> 00:41:31,760
I'm not sure if I can do it.

00:41:31,760 --> 00:41:33,760
I'm not sure if I can do it.

547
00:41:33,760 --> 00:41:35,760
I'm not sure if I can do it.

548
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:37,760
I'm not sure if I can do it.

549
00:41:37,760 --> 00:41:39,760
I'm not sure if I can do it.

550
00:41:39,760 --> 00:41:41,760
I'm not sure if I can do it.
