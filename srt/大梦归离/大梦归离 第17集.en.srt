[Episode 17]

3
00:01:48,430 --> 00:01:49,360
Dream.

4
00:02:03,070 --> 00:02:03,870
Zhuo.

5
00:02:07,390 --> 00:02:08,190
Mr. Zhuo!

6
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:32,630
Sister Pei!

7
00:02:32,630 --> 00:02:33,770
Sister Pei.

8
00:02:49,050 --> 00:02:50,850
But you have the One-Word Spell.

9
00:02:50,870 --> 00:02:52,630
You can control me at any time.

10
00:02:52,820 --> 00:02:53,940
I know.

11
00:02:54,920 --> 00:02:56,550
That's why I'll give you the ability

12
00:02:56,550 --> 00:02:58,560
to be immune to my One-Word Spell.

13
00:03:00,070 --> 00:03:00,930
Dream.

14
00:04:08,580 --> 00:04:09,770
Ying Zhao.

15
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:12,730
Do it now.

16
00:04:15,390 --> 00:04:16,769
Kill me!

17
00:04:41,650 --> 00:04:42,990
I killed her.

18
00:04:44,210 --> 00:04:45,920
I killed so many people.

19
00:04:48,330 --> 00:04:50,050
I don't deserve to live.

20
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:56,030
The blood moon

21
00:04:56,540 --> 00:04:58,400
is filled with malicious energy.

22
00:04:58,860 --> 00:05:00,060
What killed them

23
00:05:00,870 --> 00:05:02,630
was the persistent malicious energy

24
00:05:02,630 --> 00:05:04,900
in this world.

25
00:05:05,310 --> 00:05:06,380
You

26
00:05:06,630 --> 00:05:08,220
are merely a vessel

27
00:05:08,270 --> 00:05:11,190
carrying the world's anger and murderous intent.

28
00:05:12,870 --> 00:05:15,020
If this world gave me life

29
00:05:15,430 --> 00:05:17,630
to be manipulated by malicious energy,

30
00:05:18,630 --> 00:05:20,450
then I'd rather die.

31
00:05:20,590 --> 00:05:21,880
If you died,

32
00:05:22,270 --> 00:05:24,600
there would naturally be another vessel.

33
00:05:32,030 --> 00:05:33,659
This liquid

34
00:05:33,990 --> 00:05:36,650
is made from Jade Ointment and Heartless Grass.

35
00:05:40,390 --> 00:05:42,720
It can suppress malicious energy.

36
00:05:45,570 --> 00:05:46,600
If…

37
00:05:48,980 --> 00:05:50,510
If one day

38
00:05:51,590 --> 00:05:53,630
I lose control again…

39
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:57,680
you must kill me.

40
00:06:03,030 --> 00:06:04,120
Quick!

41
00:06:05,730 --> 00:06:06,980
Kill me!

42
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:14,660
Boy.

43
00:06:17,270 --> 00:06:19,050
I have to go.

44
00:06:20,670 --> 00:06:21,490
Grandpa,

45
00:06:22,110 --> 00:06:23,470
what are you going to do?

46
00:06:27,770 --> 00:06:29,150
Mr. Ying Zhao.

47
00:06:29,470 --> 00:06:30,750
Dharma.

48
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:35,250
Return.

49
00:06:41,300 --> 00:06:42,500
Grandpa!

50
00:06:42,520 --> 00:06:43,380
Grandpa!

51
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:44,340
Grandpa!

52
00:07:01,640 --> 00:07:07,660
♫Someday I'll return to my old hometown♫

53

54

Grandpa.

74
00:07:49,470 --> 00:07:49,990

♫Running towards you♫

I won't go play in the mortal world again.

I won't go to the mortal world ever again.

♫Looking for you♫

79

♫I finally heard the wind say♫

If one day

95
00:10:29,750 --> 00:10:37,430
♫Addressing love and hate♫

96
00:10:31,180 --> 00:10:33,410
I lose control again,

97
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:35,660
you must kill me.

98
00:10:36,310 --> 00:10:38,870
I'm not able to do that.

99
00:10:41,860 --> 00:10:42,890
But

100
00:10:43,810 --> 00:10:45,330
I'll think of a way.

101
00:11:26,590 --> 00:11:27,750
Do you hate him?

102
00:11:30,420 --> 00:11:31,450
I know

103
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:33,680
he was controlled by malicious energy.

104
00:11:34,740 --> 00:11:36,220
He didn't mean it.

105
00:11:38,430 --> 00:11:39,460
But he

106
00:11:41,220 --> 00:11:43,070
indeed killed my master.

107
00:11:47,010 --> 00:11:49,270
I killed my brother with my own hands too.

108
00:11:52,950 --> 00:11:55,070
Heng was controlled by Cheng Huang.

109
00:11:55,300 --> 00:11:57,430
There was nothing he could do about it.

110
00:11:57,860 --> 00:11:59,190
I worked in the Chongwu Camp

111
00:11:59,190 --> 00:12:00,470
and had to kill him.

112
00:12:01,140 --> 00:12:02,860
I had no choice either.

113
00:12:04,130 --> 00:12:05,720
After knowing the truth,

114
00:12:05,870 --> 00:12:08,070
I've been searching for a solution.

115
00:12:08,110 --> 00:12:10,490
I don't want the tragedy that befell my brother and me

116
00:12:10,490 --> 00:12:12,320
to happen to anyone else.

117
00:12:15,250 --> 00:12:16,950
But I've long forgiven you.

118
00:12:30,110 --> 00:12:31,630
Zhao Yuanzhou saved the last trace of my soul

119
00:12:31,630 --> 00:12:33,650
before it completely vanished

120
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:35,310
and attached it to a puppet.

121
00:12:36,350 --> 00:12:38,190
It's no simple magic.

122
00:12:39,190 --> 00:12:42,720
It must have cost him at least a thousand years of magical power.

123
00:12:43,750 --> 00:12:45,940
Do you have any unfulfilled wishes?

124
00:12:46,870 --> 00:12:48,260
I wish I could

125
00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:49,960
always protect my sister.

126
00:13:10,640 --> 00:13:11,870
Wen Xiao,

127
00:13:12,630 --> 00:13:14,290
cry if you want to.

128
00:13:20,510 --> 00:13:22,490
When I was a puppet…

129
00:13:24,190 --> 00:13:25,360
I couldn't cry

130
00:13:26,410 --> 00:13:28,210
because wood didn't have tears.

131
00:14:33,450 --> 00:14:34,310
Zhu Yan!

132
00:14:34,750 --> 00:14:36,070
You brat!

133
00:14:36,230 --> 00:14:37,830
You haven't learned to control malicious energy yet,

134
00:14:37,830 --> 00:14:39,760
but you left the mountain secretly.

135
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:42,080
You're so bold!

136
00:14:45,670 --> 00:14:46,750
I've already learned it.

137
00:14:46,750 --> 00:14:48,080
The hell you have!

138
00:14:49,870 --> 00:14:50,710
You…

139
00:14:52,230 --> 00:14:53,490
You bought them for me?

140
00:14:54,730 --> 00:14:56,190
I picked them up on the way.

141
00:16:02,910 --> 00:16:04,710
But you have the One-Word Spell.

142
00:16:04,910 --> 00:16:06,570
You can control me at any time.

143
00:16:07,510 --> 00:16:08,420
I know.

144
00:16:08,990 --> 00:16:10,490
So I'll give you the ability

145
00:16:10,490 --> 00:16:12,350
to be immune to my One-Word Spell.

146
00:16:14,710 --> 00:16:15,910
How long will it last?

147
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:21,280
Forever.

148
00:16:24,530 --> 00:16:26,060
I'm dead set on killing you,

149
00:16:27,030 --> 00:16:29,330
yet you're giving your weapon to me.

150
00:16:30,360 --> 00:16:31,490
I don't understand.

151
00:16:34,470 --> 00:16:36,130
He didn't give you a weapon.

152
00:16:36,930 --> 00:16:38,490
Instead, he gave you armor

153
00:16:39,170 --> 00:16:40,890
to fight against him.

154
00:16:56,350 --> 00:16:57,440
Mountain God.

155
00:17:01,270 --> 00:17:02,550
Do you hate him?

156
00:17:05,310 --> 00:17:05,910
Of course.

157
00:17:11,020 --> 00:17:12,210
Zhao Yuanzhou

158
00:17:12,250 --> 00:17:13,310
once

159
00:17:13,310 --> 00:17:15,190
gave me a bag of roasted walnuts.

160
00:17:15,940 --> 00:17:17,109
When I went down the mountain one day,

161
00:17:17,109 --> 00:17:18,650
I saw a stall selling them

162
00:17:19,230 --> 00:17:20,280
and tried one,

163
00:17:20,670 --> 00:17:22,460
but it nearly broke my teeth.

164
00:17:23,750 --> 00:17:24,839
Only then

165
00:17:24,869 --> 00:17:26,109
did I realize that

166
00:17:27,030 --> 00:17:30,160
not every walnut's shell was as thin and crispy as paper.

167
00:17:31,790 --> 00:17:32,630
In the past,

168
00:17:32,630 --> 00:17:34,490
every single walnut he bought for me

169
00:17:34,490 --> 00:17:37,060
had been carefully selected by him.

170
00:17:39,610 --> 00:17:40,660
Tell me,

171
00:17:40,790 --> 00:17:42,190
could someone

172
00:17:42,280 --> 00:17:44,200
so attentive and kind-hearted

173
00:17:44,680 --> 00:17:46,590
be an extremely evil demon?

174
00:17:54,830 --> 00:17:55,710
As for me,

175
00:17:55,740 --> 00:17:57,420
I'm indeed old now.

176
00:17:58,230 --> 00:18:00,300
My divine power is nearly depleted.

177
00:18:02,040 --> 00:18:03,030
I hope

178
00:18:03,110 --> 00:18:05,010
that the last bit of my power

179
00:18:05,030 --> 00:18:06,710
can be of help to you guys.

180
00:18:07,630 --> 00:18:10,030
I've mastered the Bingyi Sword Technique.

181
00:18:11,070 --> 00:18:12,600
I'll kill him myself.

182
00:18:15,240 --> 00:18:16,760
Mr. Zhuo.

183
00:18:17,450 --> 00:18:19,230
I'm older than you,

184
00:18:19,770 --> 00:18:21,520
so allow me to call you Zhuo.

185
00:18:23,020 --> 00:18:23,860
I know

186
00:18:23,890 --> 00:18:25,490
your hatred is hard to quell.

187
00:18:26,940 --> 00:18:28,010
But Zhao Yuanzhou

188
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:30,800
is a pitiful person who doesn't have

189
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:32,090
many options.

190
00:18:32,760 --> 00:18:33,970
All these years,

191
00:18:33,990 --> 00:18:35,510
he's been in a lot of pain

192
00:18:35,800 --> 00:18:37,650
and suffered greatly inside.

193
00:18:37,670 --> 00:18:39,330
If you don't believe me,

194
00:18:40,260 --> 00:18:41,440
find an opportunity

195
00:18:41,460 --> 00:18:43,240
to look at his back.

196
00:18:46,910 --> 00:18:48,620
Then you'll understand.

197
00:18:49,460 --> 00:18:51,630
I can use all my divine power

198
00:18:51,660 --> 00:18:52,730
to suppress

199
00:18:52,760 --> 00:18:54,760
Zhao Yuanzhou's malicious energy,

200
00:18:54,790 --> 00:18:56,250
but it won't last for long.

201
00:18:56,250 --> 00:18:57,890
One month at most.

202
00:19:14,630 --> 00:19:16,310
Are you here to kill me?

203
00:19:21,380 --> 00:19:22,480
Go ahead.

204
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:27,780
It's time to complete our deal.

205
00:19:34,630 --> 00:19:36,430
If you don't believe me,

206
00:19:36,950 --> 00:19:38,120
find an opportunity

207
00:19:38,150 --> 00:19:39,690
to look at his back.

208
00:19:41,930 --> 00:19:43,410
Then you'll understand.

209
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:54,730
What are those scars?

210
00:19:57,580 --> 00:20:00,050
My self-inflicted punishment.

211
00:20:04,420 --> 00:20:06,250
With remorse in my heart,

212
00:20:07,580 --> 00:20:09,650
even being struck by lightning

213
00:20:12,630 --> 00:20:14,670
is not enough to appease

214
00:20:14,690 --> 00:20:16,450
the torment within.

215
00:20:19,990 --> 00:20:21,690
Eight scars.

216
00:20:22,710 --> 00:20:23,520
Eight years.

217
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:26,790
Eight years.

218
00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:31,100
You had to do it to yourself

219
00:20:33,240 --> 00:20:35,140
every year after the blood moon?

220
00:20:38,730 --> 00:20:40,300
After every blood moon,

221
00:20:42,110 --> 00:20:45,690
I'd imprison myself in a secluded dwelling outside Tiandu.

222
00:20:48,020 --> 00:20:49,280
Not seeing anyone,

223
00:20:50,710 --> 00:20:52,570
not returning to the Wilderness,

224
00:20:53,350 --> 00:20:55,680
until I received a message from Ying Zhao.

225
00:20:58,240 --> 00:20:59,940
Only then did I come out.

226
00:21:06,710 --> 00:21:08,240
You're not going to kill me?

227
00:21:10,950 --> 00:21:13,010
You think I'm moved by you, don't you?

228
00:21:14,790 --> 00:21:15,890
Zhao Yuanzhou.

229
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:19,170
Life is unfair to you.

230
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:22,520
You did things you didn't mean to

231
00:21:23,210 --> 00:21:25,090
and have regrets about them.

232
00:21:26,790 --> 00:21:29,550
You think I'll forgive you just because

233
00:21:30,790 --> 00:21:32,230
you look pitiful?

234
00:21:33,810 --> 00:21:35,070
Is that what you think?

235
00:21:36,920 --> 00:21:37,930
No.

236
00:21:39,070 --> 00:21:40,310
I ended up like this

237
00:21:40,470 --> 00:21:42,870
because I did things I shouldn't have done.

238
00:21:44,610 --> 00:21:46,450
You should hate me.

239
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:47,640
I do hate you.

240
00:21:50,730 --> 00:21:52,870
You think dying by my sword

241
00:21:54,410 --> 00:21:56,180
can wipe the slate clean?

242
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:01,900
Can Ying Zhao, who died for you,

243
00:22:01,900 --> 00:22:03,140
come back to life?

244
00:22:06,980 --> 00:22:09,600
Can Ying Lei's tears not be shed?

245
00:22:13,620 --> 00:22:16,310
Can Wen Xiao hug her master again?

246
00:22:22,450 --> 00:22:23,560
Can my father

247
00:22:23,590 --> 00:22:24,430
and brother

248
00:22:26,110 --> 00:22:28,640
come back to me?

249
00:22:49,020 --> 00:22:49,780
No!

250
00:22:52,670 --> 00:22:53,570
No.

251
00:22:58,170 --> 00:22:59,260
No.

252
00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:05,290
No!

253
00:23:15,650 --> 00:23:16,410
No.

254
00:23:24,770 --> 00:23:26,910
If you want to die

255
00:23:27,610 --> 00:23:29,460
to settle all grudges

256
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:32,170
and atone for your sins,

257
00:23:33,300 --> 00:23:35,560
then you don't deserve Wen Xiao's tears,

258
00:23:35,870 --> 00:23:37,870
you don't deserve Ying Lei's blood,

259
00:23:38,150 --> 00:23:42,010
and you certainly don't deserve Mountain God Ying Zhao dying for you.

260
00:23:44,310 --> 00:23:45,210
Zhao Yuanzhou,

261
00:23:47,190 --> 00:23:49,260
if you really feel remorse…

262
00:23:52,980 --> 00:23:54,710
you should do something that can truly

263
00:23:54,710 --> 00:23:56,150
make amends to everyone.

264
00:23:58,590 --> 00:24:00,150
When your debt is paid,

265
00:24:00,550 --> 00:24:01,780
I'll then come

266
00:24:02,350 --> 00:24:03,310
to kill you.

267
00:24:09,570 --> 00:24:11,770
But the Baize Token has been destroyed.

268
00:24:14,410 --> 00:24:16,320
I'm no match for Li Lun.

269
00:24:19,150 --> 00:24:20,950
The Baize Token can be repaired.

270
00:24:22,790 --> 00:24:25,190
Ying Zhao had long prepared for sacrifice,

271
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:28,170
so he told Ying Lei in advance

272
00:24:29,190 --> 00:24:31,250
the method to repair the Baize Token.

273
00:24:31,980 --> 00:24:33,180
Go to the Wilderness.

274
00:24:34,730 --> 00:24:36,490
Find Yao Water and Divine Wood.

275
00:24:37,670 --> 00:24:39,670
Then you can repair the Baize Token.

276
00:24:42,170 --> 00:24:43,190
Zhao Yuanzhou.

277
00:24:45,900 --> 00:24:47,650
Li Lun is your sworn enemy.

278
00:24:49,250 --> 00:24:50,470
His target

279
00:24:52,250 --> 00:24:54,250
has always been you.

280
00:24:57,840 --> 00:24:59,210
You must face him.

Don't talk about death so casually.

Dying for a worthy cause

00:28:48,060 --> 00:28:50,890
♫The snowflakes are falling♫

348
00:28:50,520 --> 00:28:52,280
I feel guilty about that.

349
00:28:51,500 --> 00:28:56,480
♫A heartbeat of cold and heat♫

350
00:28:57,330 --> 00:29:00,330
♫The world is beautiful♫

351
00:28:58,410 --> 00:28:59,690
Take care of yourself.

352
00:29:00,890 --> 00:29:03,400
♫But troubled♫

353
00:29:01,470 --> 00:29:02,590
When you have time,

354
00:29:03,240 --> 00:29:04,520
come back to Mount Kunlun

355
00:29:04,280 --> 00:29:08,670
♫It's going home♫

356
00:29:05,280 --> 00:29:06,440
to see me.

357
00:29:10,430 --> 00:29:14,770
♫I'm going home♫

358
00:29:13,910 --> 00:29:15,640
You've grown up.

359
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:19,800
Choose your own way

360
00:29:19,090 --> 00:29:24,660
♫Has anyone seen a bird with a broken tail?♫

361
00:29:20,710 --> 00:29:22,300
into the future.

362
00:29:24,890 --> 00:29:30,710
♫The rain wet its feathers♫

363
00:29:27,510 --> 00:29:28,590
Grandpa.

364
00:29:33,060 --> 00:29:38,730
♫Its cry has never been heard♫

365
00:29:38,790 --> 00:29:45,400
♫Only I know its story♫

366
00:29:53,220 --> 00:29:54,040
Ying Lei.

367
00:29:58,730 --> 00:30:00,270
I'm not good at cooking,

368
00:30:01,820 --> 00:30:03,480
so I picked some plums for you.

369
00:30:05,160 --> 00:30:05,880
I just

370
00:30:05,980 --> 00:30:06,820
tried one.

371
00:30:06,890 --> 00:30:07,750
Very sweet.

372
00:30:34,340 --> 00:30:35,230
Thank you,

373
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:36,360
Jiu.

374
00:30:37,890 --> 00:30:39,000
Young Mountain God,

375
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:39,930
you're welcome.

376
00:31:41,390 --> 00:31:42,910
Jiu picked these plums.

377
00:31:44,750 --> 00:31:46,680
Mr. Zhuo, would you like to try one?

378
00:31:49,800 --> 00:31:51,800
Jiu picked them especially for you.

379
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:53,230
You eat them.

380
00:31:58,780 --> 00:32:00,640
These plums were high on the tree.

381
00:32:04,110 --> 00:32:06,370
It must have been hard for him to get them.

382
00:32:12,270 --> 00:32:13,440
When I was little,

383
00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:16,600
if the plums were too high

384
00:32:17,970 --> 00:32:19,430
and I couldn't reach them,

385
00:32:20,140 --> 00:32:22,030
Grandpa would pick them for me.

386
00:32:26,600 --> 00:32:28,370
He's gone forever.

387
00:32:31,690 --> 00:32:32,650
Mr. Zhuo.

388
00:32:35,030 --> 00:32:36,740
Grandpa is gone.

389
00:32:43,760 --> 00:32:45,590
I no longer have a grandpa.

390
00:32:46,930 --> 00:32:49,070
I have no family left.

391
00:32:54,180 --> 00:32:55,980
When my father and brother died,

392
00:32:58,490 --> 00:33:00,560
I also lost all my family.

393
00:33:13,240 --> 00:33:14,240
Mr. Zhuo.

394
00:33:16,520 --> 00:33:17,700
Your heart

395
00:33:18,900 --> 00:33:20,770
must be covered with scars too.

396
00:33:29,110 --> 00:33:30,790
My brother once told me

397
00:33:32,680 --> 00:33:34,480
that the sufferings in the world

398
00:33:34,950 --> 00:33:36,950
always left people scarred.

399
00:33:38,820 --> 00:33:40,450
But if a part of you

400
00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:41,720
gets hurt

401
00:33:41,910 --> 00:33:43,510
and damaged again and again,

402
00:33:44,280 --> 00:33:46,030
it'll become hard and strong.

403
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:50,060
At that time,

404
00:33:51,080 --> 00:33:52,530
I held my brother's hand,

405
00:33:52,560 --> 00:33:54,360
which he used to wield his sword,

406
00:33:55,100 --> 00:33:55,900
and said,

407
00:33:57,250 --> 00:33:58,530
"I know,

408
00:33:59,400 --> 00:34:00,800
that's called a callus."

409
00:34:02,570 --> 00:34:04,190
But my brother said

410
00:34:04,290 --> 00:34:05,670
what he was talking about

411
00:34:05,670 --> 00:34:06,810
wasn't a callus.

412
00:34:10,250 --> 00:34:11,830
What I'm talking about

413
00:34:12,130 --> 00:34:13,330
isn't a callus

414
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:16,320
but the heart.

415
00:34:39,940 --> 00:34:41,530
What he was talking about

416
00:34:43,580 --> 00:34:44,600
wasn't a callus

417
00:34:45,520 --> 00:34:46,500
but the heart.

418
00:35:21,560 --> 00:35:23,410
You've been here all night?

419
00:35:26,610 --> 00:35:27,580
What's the matter,

420
00:35:27,580 --> 00:35:28,420
Sister Pei?

421
00:35:33,050 --> 00:35:35,140
I forgot to tell you this last night.

422
00:35:35,880 --> 00:35:37,000
Thank you.

423
00:35:43,590 --> 00:35:45,410
Look at the canyon before us.

424
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:48,350
It's bottomless.

425
00:35:49,850 --> 00:35:51,840
If one fell off the cliff,

426
00:35:53,470 --> 00:35:55,530
even if they struggled desperately,

427
00:35:56,170 --> 00:35:58,000
they could only keep falling.

428
00:35:59,800 --> 00:36:01,030
At that moment,

429
00:36:03,230 --> 00:36:05,490
we'd wish for a tree,

430
00:36:06,790 --> 00:36:08,050
a rock,

431
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:12,040
or even a cloud to catch us.

432
00:36:16,390 --> 00:36:18,360
You helped me uncover the real reason

433
00:36:18,360 --> 00:36:19,690
why Heng killed people.

434
00:36:21,910 --> 00:36:23,230
For me,

435
00:36:24,740 --> 00:36:28,320
it was like giving me a rock wall

436
00:36:28,560 --> 00:36:30,690
that I could lean on to catch my breath.

437
00:36:37,130 --> 00:36:38,040
And you

438
00:36:39,570 --> 00:36:41,290
are Zhao Yuanzhou's tree

439
00:36:41,320 --> 00:36:42,050
and cloud.

440
00:36:57,390 --> 00:36:58,790
Neither a tree nor a cloud

441
00:37:00,080 --> 00:37:01,940
can catch someone

442
00:37:02,520 --> 00:37:04,340
who's destined to fall.

443
00:37:05,720 --> 00:37:07,500
I can't forgive him,

444
00:37:10,300 --> 00:37:12,370
but I can't hate him either.

445
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:19,130
So I can only hate myself.

446
00:37:24,860 --> 00:37:26,230
If one day

447
00:37:28,890 --> 00:37:29,950
you find out I have a secret

448
00:37:29,950 --> 00:37:31,840
as shocking as Zhao Yuanzhou's…

449
00:37:35,230 --> 00:37:36,630
would you hate me?

450
00:37:42,330 --> 00:37:43,610
That won't happen.

451
00:37:56,540 --> 00:37:57,870
Congratulations, Sir,

452
00:37:58,220 --> 00:38:00,820
for successfully destroying the Baize Token.

453
00:38:03,190 --> 00:38:04,170
The next step

454
00:38:04,720 --> 00:38:06,960
is to get Zhao Yuanzhou's inner core.

455
00:38:08,950 --> 00:38:11,750
He should've almost completed his mission by now.

456
00:38:13,080 --> 00:38:14,610
Then, Sir, your great cause

457
00:38:15,990 --> 00:38:17,190
will surely succeed.

458
00:38:37,630 --> 00:38:38,740
I'm so hungry.

459
00:38:39,680 --> 00:38:41,880
I wish I had saved more plums yesterday.

460
00:38:47,070 --> 00:38:47,870
Brother Zhuo.

461
00:38:48,130 --> 00:38:49,730
I brought you some food.

462
00:38:50,240 --> 00:38:51,290
Ying Lei said

463
00:38:51,620 --> 00:38:53,550
this is a delicacy from the Wilderness.

464
00:38:53,550 --> 00:38:54,610
It's called Zhuyu.

465
00:39:01,830 --> 00:39:02,970
Are you still angry?

466
00:39:04,360 --> 00:39:05,340
Yeah.

467
00:39:05,370 --> 00:39:07,900
Being suspected by someone you respect

468
00:39:08,020 --> 00:39:09,490
is indeed no small matter.

469
00:39:09,550 --> 00:39:11,340
You should be angry.

470
00:39:11,850 --> 00:39:12,980
Brother Zhuo,

471
00:39:13,320 --> 00:39:15,260
you think I respect you?

472
00:39:19,280 --> 00:39:20,410
Forget what I said.

473
00:39:20,430 --> 00:39:22,270
I admire you!

474
00:39:30,620 --> 00:39:31,660
Eat. Eat up.

475
00:39:33,640 --> 00:39:34,600
Ying Lei said

476
00:39:35,180 --> 00:39:38,040
Zhuyu is a divine herb that grows in the Western Sea.

477
00:39:38,040 --> 00:39:39,390
Eating just one blade of it

478
00:39:39,390 --> 00:39:41,320
can keep you full for an entire day.

479
00:40:02,510 --> 00:40:04,240
I brought you something to eat!

480
00:40:04,390 --> 00:40:05,970
I was worried Little Bunny might be hungry,

481
00:40:05,970 --> 00:40:07,620
so I roasted some taro.

482
00:40:07,710 --> 00:40:08,510
Try it.

483
00:40:12,420 --> 00:40:13,080
Didn't you…

484
00:40:14,270 --> 00:40:16,670
Didn't you tell us to eat Zhuyu?

485
00:40:20,080 --> 00:40:22,080
You just need to hold it in your hand.

486
00:40:22,160 --> 00:40:23,440
You don't eat it.

487
00:40:27,150 --> 00:40:28,180
It's alright.

488
00:40:28,440 --> 00:40:29,200
Brother Zhuo,

489
00:40:29,200 --> 00:40:30,520
I still admire you.

490
00:40:31,300 --> 00:40:32,310
Shut up.

491
00:40:33,070 --> 00:40:33,870
Okay.

492
00:41:12,510 --> 00:41:13,510
Lady Goddess.

493
00:41:16,830 --> 00:41:18,900
Looks like you've made your choice.

494
00:41:19,110 --> 00:41:19,590
Well,

495
00:41:19,630 --> 00:41:20,720
Young Mountain God,

496
00:41:20,720 --> 00:41:23,200
you didn't look like much usually,

497
00:41:23,220 --> 00:41:25,210
but you look quite presentable today in that outfit,

498
00:41:25,210 --> 00:41:26,980
giving off a bit of the vibe of the Mountain God.

499
00:41:26,980 --> 00:41:28,020
Do I?

500
00:41:29,240 --> 00:41:31,840
This is the first time you've complimented me.

501
00:41:34,150 --> 00:41:35,400
I've made my decision.

502
00:41:35,400 --> 00:41:36,260
I'll stay here,

503
00:41:36,390 --> 00:41:37,550
protecting Kunlun,

504
00:41:38,060 --> 00:41:40,460
continuing my grandpa's unfinished work.

505
00:41:40,760 --> 00:41:43,090
With my limited power as the Mountain God,

506
00:41:43,560 --> 00:41:45,620
I'll try to delay Kunlun's collapse.

507
00:41:49,040 --> 00:41:50,570
You're staying here?

508
00:41:56,540 --> 00:41:57,310
Yes.

509
00:42:00,820 --> 00:42:03,080
I'm not going to the Wilderness with you.

510
00:42:06,810 --> 00:42:07,960
Take care, guys.

511
00:42:10,050 --> 00:42:11,590
We'll meet again.

512
00:42:14,740 --> 00:42:16,940
I'll do my best to be a good Mountain God…

513
00:42:20,010 --> 00:42:21,510
to make my grandpa proud.

514
00:42:22,950 --> 00:42:24,070
Your grandpa

515
00:42:25,300 --> 00:42:27,310
was always proud of you.

516
00:42:30,080 --> 00:42:30,880
Ying Lei.

517
00:42:32,130 --> 00:42:33,320
Take care.

518
00:42:36,990 --> 00:42:38,000
Okay.

519
00:42:48,090 --> 00:42:49,150
This…

520
00:42:56,100 --> 00:42:56,980
It's for you.

521
00:43:00,360 --> 00:43:01,820
The journey ahead is long.

522
00:43:02,160 --> 00:43:03,080
I hope

523
00:43:03,110 --> 00:43:04,180
it'll be of help.

524
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:08,590
Yeah.

525
00:43:10,310 --> 00:43:12,710
We'll inevitably have to run for our lives.

526
00:43:16,670 --> 00:43:17,470
Take care.

527
00:43:18,040 --> 00:43:19,190
Next time we come back,

528
00:43:19,190 --> 00:43:21,650
make the most delicious dishes for me, okay?

529
00:43:23,480 --> 00:43:24,890
I'm not used to it.

530
00:43:26,600 --> 00:43:27,540
Indeed.

531
00:43:28,320 --> 00:43:29,690
This outfit

532
00:43:30,410 --> 00:43:32,210
is new to me too.

533
00:43:33,820 --> 00:43:34,820
Maybe

534
00:43:34,850 --> 00:43:36,480
I should grow my beard back.

535
00:43:37,010 --> 00:43:40,080
Otherwise, I really just look like a child in adults' clothing.

536
00:43:40,080 --> 00:43:41,320
I mean,

537
00:43:41,640 --> 00:43:43,300
you'll not be around anymore,

538
00:43:43,870 --> 00:43:45,310
and I'm not used to that.

539
00:43:47,670 --> 00:43:49,400
Even though you're quite noisy

540
00:43:49,650 --> 00:43:51,050
and annoying sometimes.

541
00:43:51,920 --> 00:43:52,410
Ah,

542
00:43:52,440 --> 00:43:53,180
never mind.

543
00:43:54,030 --> 00:43:55,000
At least

544
00:43:55,840 --> 00:43:57,840
when Brother Zhuo wasn't around

545
00:43:58,430 --> 00:43:59,600
and I was scared,

546
00:44:00,400 --> 00:44:01,660
I could hold your arm,

547
00:44:02,670 --> 00:44:03,650
grab your hand,

548
00:44:05,150 --> 00:44:06,410
and seize your sleeve.

549
00:44:08,760 --> 00:44:10,810
Then I'll cut off a piece of my sleeve for you.

550
00:44:10,810 --> 00:44:12,250
When you're afraid,

551
00:44:12,720 --> 00:44:13,850
you can hold it tight

552
00:44:14,110 --> 00:44:15,990
as if I were by your side.

553
00:44:16,430 --> 00:44:17,670
I don't need that.

554
00:44:18,190 --> 00:44:21,540
In the mortal world, cutting off the sleeve means cutting ties.

555
00:44:21,540 --> 00:44:23,600
I don't want to be an ingrate.

556
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:26,750
Jiu.

557
00:44:28,630 --> 00:44:29,950
You'll surely become

558
00:44:30,600 --> 00:44:32,400
the best physician in the world.

559
00:44:33,830 --> 00:44:34,630
Good luck.

560
00:44:35,330 --> 00:44:36,530
I'll miss you.

561
00:44:59,310 --> 00:45:00,040
We will.

562
00:45:06,290 --> 00:45:07,910
We'll meet again.

563
00:45:08,740 --> 00:45:09,580
Yeah.
