Ambient music

3
00:00:10,040 --> 00:00:14,800
Life is beautiful

5
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:21,920
everyone вже

role-playing

7
00:00:55,820 --> 00:01:00,820
I'm sorry, but I'm not sure if I can get the money back.

8
00:01:00,820 --> 00:01:05,820
I'm sorry, but I'm not sure if I can get the money back.

9
00:01:05,820 --> 00:01:10,820
I'm sorry, but I'm not sure if I can get the money back.

10
00:01:10,820 --> 00:01:15,820
I'm sorry, but I'm not sure if I can get the money back.

11
00:01:15,820 --> 00:01:20,820
I'm sorry, but I'm not sure if I can get the money back.

12
00:01:20,820 --> 00:01:25,820
I'm sorry, but I'm not sure if I can get the money back.

13
00:01:25,820 --> 00:01:30,820
I'm sorry, but I'm not sure if I can get the money back.

14
00:01:30,820 --> 00:01:35,820
I'm sorry, but I'm not sure if I can get the money back.

15
00:01:35,820 --> 00:01:40,820
I'm sorry, but I'm not sure if I can get the money back.

16
00:01:50,820 --> 00:01:53,820
I'm sorry, but I'm not sure if I can get the money back.

17
00:01:53,820 --> 00:01:56,820
Because I'm afraid of the plague,

18
00:01:56,820 --> 00:02:00,820
I hid in the cave to live alone.

19
00:02:00,820 --> 00:02:04,820
I was in the mountains for 5 years.

20
00:02:04,820 --> 00:02:07,820
I've been talking about my old days.

21
00:02:07,820 --> 00:02:10,820
I had a long life,

22
00:02:11,820 --> 00:02:14,820
but I was lonely.

23
00:02:14,820 --> 00:02:17,820
Finally, one day,

24
00:02:17,820 --> 00:02:22,820
I still couldn't help but go to someone's place.

25
00:02:23,820 --> 00:02:26,820
Then, I met Qinggeng.

26
00:02:29,820 --> 00:02:33,820
Qinggeng is my first friend I've ever met.

27
00:02:33,820 --> 00:02:35,820
I'm very happy.

28
00:02:35,820 --> 00:02:38,820
Because I've been looking for Qinggeng in the city for a long time,

29
00:02:38,820 --> 00:02:41,820
I'm still very satisfied.

30
00:02:41,820 --> 00:02:44,820
It's not because of me.

31
00:02:44,820 --> 00:02:49,820
The world of love has become a chain of love.

32
00:02:58,820 --> 00:03:01,820
Because Qinggeng can suppress the plague,

33
00:03:01,820 --> 00:03:05,820
I can only put our seal together in the mountain.

34
00:03:06,820 --> 00:03:09,820
I was too selfish.

35
00:03:09,820 --> 00:03:12,820
I wanted to cure the plague.

36
00:03:13,820 --> 00:03:16,820
Don't make yourself too difficult.

37
00:03:16,820 --> 00:03:18,820
It's all because of you.

38
00:03:18,820 --> 00:03:21,820
I didn't want to see you again.

39
00:03:24,820 --> 00:03:27,820
Because of me,

40
00:03:27,820 --> 00:03:31,820
he was trapped in this world of love.

41
00:03:31,820 --> 00:03:35,820
He was always trapped in this world of love.

42
00:03:38,820 --> 00:03:43,820
My existence is the biggest misfortune of Qinggeng.

43
00:03:48,820 --> 00:03:50,820
This is my bomb.

44
00:03:50,820 --> 00:03:52,820
Wait.

45
00:03:52,820 --> 00:03:54,820
You're right.

46
00:03:56,820 --> 00:03:58,820
Could it be...

47
00:04:02,820 --> 00:04:04,820
No.

48
00:04:10,820 --> 00:04:13,820
As long as I die,

49
00:04:13,820 --> 00:04:16,820
I'll be gone forever.

50
00:04:25,820 --> 00:04:27,820
Please.

51
00:04:28,820 --> 00:04:31,820
Don't kill him.

52
00:04:31,820 --> 00:04:35,820
If Qinggeng is gone,

53
00:04:35,820 --> 00:04:41,820
I'll never have any friends in this world.

54
00:04:52,820 --> 00:04:55,820
I'm talking to myself.

55
00:04:57,820 --> 00:05:00,820
I don't deserve to live in this world.

56
00:05:00,820 --> 00:05:06,820
But I really like the light and the food here.

57
00:05:07,820 --> 00:05:10,820
I'm still happy.

58
00:05:11,820 --> 00:05:14,820
I'm happy.

59
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:23,820
It's just because of me.

60
00:05:23,820 --> 00:05:27,820
I'm not here.

61
00:05:53,820 --> 00:05:56,820
I'm sorry.

62
00:05:56,820 --> 00:05:59,820
I'm sorry.

63
00:05:59,820 --> 00:06:02,820
I'm sorry.

64
00:06:02,820 --> 00:06:05,820
I'm sorry.

65
00:06:05,820 --> 00:06:08,820
I'm sorry.

66
00:06:08,820 --> 00:06:11,820
I'm sorry.

67
00:06:11,820 --> 00:06:14,820
I'm sorry.

68
00:06:14,820 --> 00:06:17,820
I'm sorry.

69
00:06:17,820 --> 00:06:20,820
I'm sorry.

70
00:06:21,820 --> 00:06:24,820
I'm sorry.

71
00:06:28,820 --> 00:06:31,820
Where's Fei?

72
00:06:33,820 --> 00:06:35,820
He's dead.

73
00:06:35,820 --> 00:06:38,820
He's Zi Huo's son.

74
00:06:51,820 --> 00:06:53,820
I'm sorry.

75
00:07:08,820 --> 00:07:11,820
It's good that he's dead.

76
00:07:11,820 --> 00:07:14,820
He's dead.

77
00:07:16,820 --> 00:07:19,820
I can be free.

78
00:07:20,820 --> 00:07:23,820
But there's no room for me.

79
00:07:24,820 --> 00:07:27,820
I'm sorry.

80
00:07:28,820 --> 00:07:31,820
What's wrong?

81
00:07:31,820 --> 00:07:33,820
It's just nothing.

82
00:07:33,820 --> 00:07:36,820
You should go home.

83
00:07:36,820 --> 00:07:38,820
Go home.

84
00:07:41,820 --> 00:07:44,820
But it's really bad.

85
00:07:44,820 --> 00:07:47,820
It's really good.

86
00:07:47,820 --> 00:07:49,820
Why did you cry?

87
00:07:51,820 --> 00:07:53,820
Because I hid something in you.

88
00:08:04,820 --> 00:08:07,820
I just found out that you have a medical device in your body.

89
00:08:09,820 --> 00:08:11,820
So I asked Lord Xiao Luo

90
00:08:12,820 --> 00:08:14,820
to use his medical blood

91
00:08:14,820 --> 00:08:16,820
to purify your blood.

92
00:08:17,820 --> 00:08:20,820
And Lord Xiao Luo is very angry.

93
00:08:21,820 --> 00:08:24,820
His blood will purify your blood.

94
00:08:44,820 --> 00:08:46,820
You are very angry.

95
00:09:01,820 --> 00:09:03,820
Look at the medicine.

96
00:09:04,820 --> 00:09:06,820
It's very dark.

97
00:09:07,820 --> 00:09:09,820
It's because of him

98
00:09:10,820 --> 00:09:12,820
that I feel more angry.

99
00:09:14,820 --> 00:09:16,820
Let's go to the hospital.

100
00:09:17,820 --> 00:09:18,820
Yes.

101
00:09:19,820 --> 00:09:22,820
Turn into a book of Chen Zhong of the Sun and the Moon of the Sun.

102
00:09:23,820 --> 00:09:26,820
And put you in the dark of the day.

103
00:09:29,820 --> 00:09:31,820
If you can heal anyone,

104
00:09:32,820 --> 00:09:34,820
even if the seal is in the fire,

105
00:09:35,820 --> 00:09:37,820
it's not meaningful at all.

106
00:09:38,820 --> 00:09:40,820
We are dealing with one thing.

107
00:09:41,820 --> 00:09:43,820
We will always be in the same boat.

108
00:09:44,820 --> 00:09:46,820
Are you okay?

109
00:09:53,820 --> 00:09:54,820
Look.

110
00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:13,820
The Buddha said that

111
00:10:14,820 --> 00:10:16,820
he is strong in his own way.

112
00:10:17,820 --> 00:10:19,820
He never knew that

113
00:10:19,820 --> 00:10:22,820
his life and medicine would be in vain.

114
00:10:24,820 --> 00:10:26,820
I asked Li Xiao Mi and the Buddha

115
00:10:28,820 --> 00:10:30,820
if he was loyal to him.

116
00:10:31,820 --> 00:10:33,820
I will not be the Buddha again.

117
00:10:36,820 --> 00:10:38,820
Zhao Yun Zhou.

118
00:10:40,820 --> 00:10:42,820
You are cruel.

119
00:10:47,820 --> 00:10:49,820
I can heal the seal

120
00:10:50,820 --> 00:10:53,820
and help me to heal the internal and external strength of the mountain.

121
00:10:56,820 --> 00:10:57,820
The seal.

122
00:10:59,820 --> 00:11:01,820
This seal should be from Li Yun.

123
00:11:03,820 --> 00:11:06,820
The sun and moon will always affect your mind.

124
00:11:07,820 --> 00:11:08,820
Now,

125
00:11:09,820 --> 00:11:11,820
you can listen to your heart.

126
00:11:14,820 --> 00:11:16,820
Are you really very tired?

127
00:11:36,820 --> 00:11:39,460
Sun θαMm gOMng Won't let you hide.

128
00:11:41,820 --> 00:11:42,820
Correct!

129
00:11:47,820 --> 00:11:48,820
It's finally solved!

130
00:11:50,820 --> 00:11:52,820
Love in the water

131
00:11:53,820 --> 00:11:55,820
will make stars appear over the surface of the earth.

132
00:11:55,820 --> 00:11:58,820
As long as you are fine and healthy.

133
00:11:59,820 --> 00:12:01,820
Then, this is what I want.

134
00:12:36,820 --> 00:12:40,820
The bottle

135
00:12:40,820 --> 00:12:44,820
I don't want to think about it

136
00:12:44,820 --> 00:12:48,820
Wait

137
00:12:48,820 --> 00:12:52,820
I want to go when I fall

138
00:12:56,820 --> 00:12:58,820
My wind

139
00:13:00,820 --> 00:13:02,820
What should I do?

140
00:13:02,820 --> 00:13:06,820
You help me

141
00:13:27,820 --> 00:13:29,820
It's raining

142
00:13:29,820 --> 00:13:31,820
I'm not afraid of the rain

143
00:13:31,820 --> 00:13:33,820
Where do you want to hang?

144
00:13:59,820 --> 00:14:05,820
I want to forget

145
00:14:07,820 --> 00:14:09,820
Friend

146
00:14:09,820 --> 00:14:11,820
Right, friend

147
00:14:11,820 --> 00:14:12,820
What's wrong?

148
00:14:12,820 --> 00:14:13,820
Is not good?

149
00:14:13,820 --> 00:14:15,820
Good, of course good

150
00:14:15,820 --> 00:14:17,820
Just

151
00:14:17,820 --> 00:14:20,820
I'm still the first friend

152
00:14:22,820 --> 00:14:25,820
I am not with the people

153
00:14:25,820 --> 00:14:27,820
in my hands

154
00:14:28,820 --> 00:14:31,820
When I love the world

155
00:14:31,820 --> 00:14:33,820
When my head is in a mess

156
00:14:33,820 --> 00:14:35,820
I'm in a storm

157
00:14:35,820 --> 00:14:38,820
I'm just a disaster

158
00:14:39,820 --> 00:14:41,820
I have no blood

159
00:14:45,820 --> 00:14:47,820
So I don't want to come near you

160
00:14:57,820 --> 00:14:59,820
I dare to choose

161
00:15:06,820 --> 00:15:08,820
Why do you like everything?

162
00:15:08,820 --> 00:15:10,820
I like everything

163
00:15:10,820 --> 00:15:14,820
I like everything about the world

164
00:15:16,820 --> 00:15:18,820
Don't like Dahuang

165
00:15:22,820 --> 00:15:25,820
Dahuang is too crazy

166
00:15:25,820 --> 00:15:27,820
He doesn't like me

167
00:15:56,820 --> 00:15:57,820
I climb up

168
00:15:57,820 --> 00:15:59,820
Be careful, it's raining

169
00:15:59,820 --> 00:16:00,820
Ok

170
00:16:07,820 --> 00:16:09,820
When the dead run away

171
00:16:09,820 --> 00:16:13,820
I will bring him back to Dahuang

172
00:16:14,820 --> 00:16:16,820
And seal him

173
00:16:20,820 --> 00:16:22,820
I'm in a storm

174
00:16:22,820 --> 00:16:24,820
I'm willing to be with you

175
00:16:24,820 --> 00:16:26,820
I'm willing to be with you

176
00:16:26,820 --> 00:16:28,820
And seal you

177
00:16:28,820 --> 00:16:31,820
Your life is a mother

178
00:16:31,820 --> 00:16:35,820
I should have the freedom to fly

179
00:16:35,820 --> 00:16:37,820
Do you want to choose this?

180
00:16:37,820 --> 00:16:40,820
But I still have blood

181
00:16:41,820 --> 00:16:44,820
But what about the rain?

182
00:16:45,820 --> 00:16:48,820
The river is not in the hands of the evil

183
00:16:49,820 --> 00:16:51,820
Does he have blood?

184
00:16:52,820 --> 00:16:54,820
This is my choice

185
00:16:54,820 --> 00:16:56,820
I'm afraid that God will punish me

186
00:17:48,820 --> 00:17:50,820
It's all my fault

187
00:17:50,820 --> 00:17:52,820
I hurt you

188
00:17:59,820 --> 00:18:01,820
I can always be with you

189
00:18:05,820 --> 00:18:07,820
Will you regret it?

190
00:18:07,820 --> 00:18:09,820
I won't

191
00:18:09,820 --> 00:18:11,820
I will not

192
00:18:11,820 --> 00:18:13,820
I will not

193
00:18:13,820 --> 00:18:15,820
I will not

194
00:18:15,820 --> 00:18:17,820
I will not

195
00:18:18,820 --> 00:18:20,820
I will not

196
00:18:20,820 --> 00:18:22,820
I will not

197
00:18:26,820 --> 00:18:27,820
He is just one person

198
00:18:27,820 --> 00:18:29,520
Simple

199
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:30,820
Simple

200
00:18:30,820 --> 00:18:32,160
Simple

201
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:37,820
I love you

202
00:18:37,820 --> 00:18:41,820
The day is turning, the moon is shining

203
00:18:41,820 --> 00:18:44,820
The stars are shining

204
00:18:44,820 --> 00:18:48,820
The dream is so bright

205
00:18:48,820 --> 00:18:50,820
I can't help but miss you

206
00:18:50,820 --> 00:18:54,820
The sun is shining, the moon is shining

207
00:18:54,820 --> 00:18:58,820
The moon is shining, the moon is shining

208
00:18:58,820 --> 00:19:04,820
Every time I meet you, you are my secret

209
00:19:04,820 --> 00:19:08,820
The memory is so secret

210
00:19:08,820 --> 00:19:11,820
The past is so bright

211
00:19:11,820 --> 00:19:14,820
I can't help but miss you

212
00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:17,820
The sun is shining, the moon is shining

213
00:19:17,820 --> 00:19:21,820
The light is so bright

214
00:19:21,820 --> 00:19:24,820
The time is so long

215
00:19:24,820 --> 00:19:28,820
Sometimes I feel so bored

216
00:19:28,820 --> 00:19:32,820
I want to go out and see the flowers

217
00:19:33,820 --> 00:19:35,820
But every time I see the moon

218
00:19:35,820 --> 00:19:38,820
Because of my happy company

219
00:19:38,820 --> 00:19:44,820
I feel like I'm worth it

220
00:19:46,820 --> 00:19:48,820
You are so good

221
00:19:48,820 --> 00:19:50,820
You are better than me

222
00:19:54,820 --> 00:19:56,820
You are so good

223
00:19:56,820 --> 00:20:04,820
I know you found me

224
00:20:26,820 --> 00:20:31,820
I want to go out and see the flowers

225
00:20:42,820 --> 00:20:45,820
I want to see you break the ice

226
00:20:45,820 --> 00:20:48,820
I want to see you break the ice

227
00:20:49,820 --> 00:20:52,820
That's how he really looks

228
00:20:57,820 --> 00:20:59,820
Day closed

229
00:21:14,380 --> 00:21:17,420
You were very careful when you came to these countries

230
00:21:17,420 --> 00:21:20,820
Now you are not watching the picture

231
00:21:21,820 --> 00:21:24,820
Are all all right

232
00:21:24,820 --> 00:21:27,700
Why would I turn back justice?

233
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:42,000
A Faceless fucking God,

234
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:45,100
turned all the gods into weapons,

235
00:21:45,240 --> 00:21:49,480
and have all of your money purse scrapped too?

236
00:21:49,580 --> 00:21:52,500
But I essentially don't have to save money.

237
00:21:52,500 --> 00:21:53,500
He is a human.

238
00:21:54,500 --> 00:21:55,500
He is not a demon.

239
00:21:56,500 --> 00:21:59,500
He understands the pain and struggle of the demon.

240
00:22:01,500 --> 00:22:03,500
Every choice he makes

241
00:22:04,500 --> 00:22:08,500
is to sacrifice his life to protect human.

242
00:22:09,500 --> 00:22:10,500
Is this fair?

243
00:22:11,500 --> 00:22:12,500
Your sacrifice

244
00:22:13,500 --> 00:22:15,500
is meaningless.

245
00:22:18,500 --> 00:22:19,500
I will not let you go.

246
00:22:19,500 --> 00:22:20,500
Wu Yi Yi

247
00:22:23,500 --> 00:22:24,500
you want to save the king?

248
00:22:43,500 --> 00:22:45,500
The hatred I told him

249
00:22:46,500 --> 00:22:47,500
is all because of you.

250
00:22:47,500 --> 00:22:49,500
I don't want to see you again.

251
00:22:51,500 --> 00:22:52,500
It's not true.

252
00:22:58,500 --> 00:23:01,500
But the days we spent together

253
00:23:03,500 --> 00:23:05,500
I didn't regret it.

254
00:23:09,500 --> 00:23:11,500
But I still can't tell him

255
00:23:12,500 --> 00:23:14,500
these words.

256
00:23:15,500 --> 00:23:18,500
He won't hear it anymore.

257
00:23:21,500 --> 00:23:22,500
Don't blame yourself.

258
00:23:24,500 --> 00:23:26,500
The real culprit is not you.

259
00:23:29,500 --> 00:23:30,500
It's Li Lun.

260
00:23:37,500 --> 00:23:38,500
Xiao Chu.

261
00:23:39,500 --> 00:23:40,500
Xiao Chu.

262
00:23:40,500 --> 00:23:41,500
Wu Yi Yi is not Xiao Chu.

263
00:23:41,500 --> 00:23:42,500
Wu Yi Xiao.

264
00:23:42,500 --> 00:23:43,500
Wu Yi Xiao.

265
00:23:44,500 --> 00:23:46,500
But it's not because of Wu Yi Yi.

266
00:23:46,500 --> 00:23:48,500
Isn't he dead?

267
00:23:50,500 --> 00:23:51,500
Zhou Wei.

268
00:23:51,500 --> 00:23:52,500
Xiao Jiu.

269
00:23:52,500 --> 00:23:53,500
It's bad.

270
00:23:53,500 --> 00:23:54,500
Hurry up.

271
00:23:54,500 --> 00:23:55,500
Hurry up.

272
00:23:57,500 --> 00:23:58,500
Thank you.

273
00:24:09,500 --> 00:24:12,500
The plague of the fat is not good.

274
00:24:14,500 --> 00:24:15,500
I'm sorry.

275
00:24:15,500 --> 00:24:16,500
I hurt you.

276
00:24:19,500 --> 00:24:20,500
I didn't expect

277
00:24:20,500 --> 00:24:22,500
the end of our relationship

278
00:24:23,500 --> 00:24:25,500
would be so painful.

279
00:24:27,500 --> 00:24:28,500
But we died together

280
00:24:29,500 --> 00:24:30,500
is a fate.

281
00:24:31,500 --> 00:24:32,500
Fate

282
00:24:33,500 --> 00:24:35,500
is really

283
00:24:36,500 --> 00:24:37,500
the fate of eight lives

284
00:24:37,500 --> 00:24:38,500
with you.

285
00:24:42,500 --> 00:24:43,500
Aren't you a demon?

286
00:24:44,500 --> 00:24:46,500
If you were defeated by Wu Yi Yi

287
00:24:47,500 --> 00:24:49,500
wouldn't you be too upset?

288
00:24:50,500 --> 00:24:52,500
Think of a way.

289
00:24:54,500 --> 00:24:55,500
I can't die.

290
00:24:56,500 --> 00:24:57,500
But I've been

291
00:24:58,500 --> 00:24:59,500
sick for so long.

292
00:25:00,500 --> 00:25:01,500
It's worse.

293
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:03,500
I need to get rid of the disease

294
00:25:03,500 --> 00:25:04,500
and treat you.

295
00:25:04,500 --> 00:25:05,500
I'll do it.

296
00:25:05,500 --> 00:25:07,500
I don't want you to die.

297
00:25:07,500 --> 00:25:08,500
I need to go to the hospital.

298
00:25:08,500 --> 00:25:09,500
I have a way.

299
00:25:11,500 --> 00:25:12,500
Xiao Jiu.

300
00:25:14,500 --> 00:25:15,500
I'm sorry.

301
00:25:16,500 --> 00:25:17,500
I'm sorry.

302
00:25:42,500 --> 00:25:43,500
What's so sad?

303
00:25:44,500 --> 00:25:45,500
I need to see you.

304
00:25:47,500 --> 00:25:48,500
You can rely on me.

305
00:25:58,500 --> 00:26:00,500
You can rely on me.

306
00:26:01,500 --> 00:26:02,500
Your shoulder is stuck.

307
00:26:03,500 --> 00:26:04,500
How dare you.

308
00:26:05,500 --> 00:26:06,500
You're praising me.

309
00:26:09,500 --> 00:26:11,500
To be honest,

310
00:26:11,500 --> 00:26:13,500
if you didn't remember me

311
00:26:14,500 --> 00:26:16,500
and pretended to faint,

312
00:26:17,500 --> 00:26:18,500
we wouldn't have found

313
00:26:18,500 --> 00:26:19,500
the real brother so soon.

314
00:26:22,500 --> 00:26:23,500
The real brother?

315
00:26:25,500 --> 00:26:26,500
It's Lile.

316
00:26:29,500 --> 00:26:30,500
It should be Lile.

317
00:26:31,500 --> 00:26:32,500
Why did you do that?

318
00:26:33,500 --> 00:26:35,500
They're actually together.

319
00:26:38,500 --> 00:26:39,500
Lile gave Qing Gao

320
00:26:40,500 --> 00:26:41,500
a black blood.

321
00:26:41,500 --> 00:26:43,500
She was so cruel to him.

322
00:26:44,500 --> 00:26:45,500
She was so cruel.

323
00:26:46,500 --> 00:26:48,500
Then she asked

324
00:26:49,500 --> 00:26:50,500
to take him away.

325
00:26:52,500 --> 00:26:53,500
That mysterious man

326
00:26:54,500 --> 00:26:55,500
kidnapped me here.

327
00:26:56,500 --> 00:26:57,500
He wanted to kill you

328
00:26:57,500 --> 00:26:58,500
with the Cloud Sword

329
00:26:58,500 --> 00:26:59,500
and take your burden.

330
00:27:00,500 --> 00:27:01,500
Lile is the monster.

331
00:27:03,500 --> 00:27:04,500
What does he want your burden?

332
00:27:04,500 --> 00:27:05,500
What does he want your burden?

333
00:27:11,500 --> 00:27:13,500
When Qing Gao was begging me,

334
00:27:14,500 --> 00:27:15,500
he used the Moon Poison.

335
00:27:17,500 --> 00:27:18,500
The Moon Poison?

336
00:27:20,500 --> 00:27:21,500
The Moon Poison?

337
00:27:23,500 --> 00:27:24,500
She was so cruel to him.

338
00:27:25,500 --> 00:27:26,500
She was so cruel to him.

339
00:27:26,500 --> 00:27:27,500
She was so cruel to him.

340
00:27:28,500 --> 00:27:29,500
She was so cruel to him.

341
00:27:31,500 --> 00:27:32,500
She was so cruel to him.

342
00:27:32,500 --> 00:27:33,500
She was so cruel to him.

343
00:27:34,500 --> 00:27:35,500
He did that

344
00:27:35,500 --> 00:27:36,500
just a few years ago.

345
00:27:37,500 --> 00:27:38,500
Lile is fine now.

346
00:27:41,500 --> 00:27:42,500
She's also very cruel.

347
00:27:42,500 --> 00:27:43,500
I can't eat her.

348
00:27:44,500 --> 00:27:45,500
What if she's in the blood?

349
00:27:55,500 --> 00:27:56,500
Lord Xiao Zhuo.

350
00:27:57,500 --> 00:27:58,500
Please.

351
00:27:58,500 --> 00:27:59,500
I can't die in the river.

352
00:28:00,500 --> 00:28:01,500
I have no space for my husband.

353
00:28:02,500 --> 00:28:03,740
No, it's not.

354
00:28:06,460 --> 00:28:08,300
I didn't say anything.

355
00:28:08,300 --> 00:28:09,700
And you wouldn't participate.

356
00:28:10,300 --> 00:28:11,460
Well..

357
00:28:12,340 --> 00:28:13,420
I have to call...

358
00:28:13,420 --> 00:28:14,780
the Marquis.

359
00:28:14,780 --> 00:28:15,780
Did I say it?

360
00:28:15,780 --> 00:28:17,580
There's another explanation like this.

361
00:28:17,580 --> 00:28:19,120
號gawa幣

362
00:28:20,180 --> 00:28:21,420
This is...

363
00:28:21,420 --> 00:28:21,980
No.

364
00:28:21,980 --> 00:28:23,060
It's...

365
00:28:23,060 --> 00:28:25,140
I'm going to make an departed man into a heroine.

366
00:28:25,140 --> 00:28:27,140
Then call me that.

367
00:28:27,140 --> 00:28:29,100
Just like this.

368
00:28:29,100 --> 00:28:30,900
it했던 rolling away

369
00:28:30,900 --> 00:28:32,060
the baby.

370
00:28:32,460 --> 00:28:33,820
Why doesn't it work?

371
00:28:35,100 --> 00:28:37,180
Qinggeng did listen to me.

372
00:28:38,220 --> 00:28:39,660
He has been doing research for years.

373
00:28:41,260 --> 00:28:42,180
It seems that

374
00:28:42,900 --> 00:28:44,100
the medicalFC

375
00:28:44,100 --> 00:28:47,100
can treat all limbs of the baby.

376
00:28:47,540 --> 00:28:58,040
Medical

377
00:28:58,040 --> 00:29:00,040
I'm so disappointed.

378
00:29:01,040 --> 00:29:03,040
I know what you are.

379
00:29:10,040 --> 00:29:13,040
They say that the tree will grow more than 100 years.

380
00:29:13,040 --> 00:29:16,040
It's a good thing that it's a flower.

381
00:29:16,040 --> 00:29:19,040
That's why it can be a warm plant.

382
00:29:20,040 --> 00:29:22,040
But this tree is already bitter.

383
00:29:22,040 --> 00:29:23,040
It's not flowery.

384
00:29:23,040 --> 00:29:25,040
It doesn't even have leaves.

385
00:29:25,040 --> 00:29:26,040
What should we do?

386
00:29:27,040 --> 00:29:29,040
How about the tree skin?

387
00:29:32,040 --> 00:29:33,040
It's bitter.

388
00:29:36,040 --> 00:29:38,040
It's so painful.

389
00:29:38,040 --> 00:29:40,040
It's a hand pain.

390
00:29:40,040 --> 00:29:41,040
It's a hand pain.

391
00:29:41,040 --> 00:29:42,040
Come on.

392
00:29:46,040 --> 00:29:47,040
No.

393
00:29:47,040 --> 00:29:48,040
This tree skin is too hard.

394
00:29:48,040 --> 00:29:51,040
I have to go to the Cloud Light Sword of Master Xiao Zhu.

395
00:29:52,040 --> 00:29:53,040
Sorry.

396
00:29:53,040 --> 00:29:55,040
Look at me.

397
00:29:55,040 --> 00:29:57,040
I'm a good person.

398
00:30:05,040 --> 00:30:06,040
Oh my god.

399
00:30:06,040 --> 00:30:08,040
This is so bitter.

400
00:30:18,040 --> 00:30:19,040
I'm hungry.

401
00:30:19,040 --> 00:30:20,040
It's bitter.

402
00:30:22,040 --> 00:30:24,040
Xiao Qiao, thank you.

403
00:30:25,040 --> 00:30:26,040
It's nothing.

404
00:30:26,040 --> 00:30:28,040
Master Xiao Zhu is serious.

405
00:30:36,040 --> 00:30:37,040
Look at me.

406
00:30:37,040 --> 00:30:38,040
I'm so bitter.

407
00:30:50,040 --> 00:30:52,040
Sister Pei, take your time.

408
00:31:03,040 --> 00:31:04,040
Be careful.

409
00:31:12,040 --> 00:31:14,040
Master Xiao Zhu, thank you.

410
00:31:15,040 --> 00:31:16,040
Don't mention it.

411
00:31:16,040 --> 00:31:17,040
I'm so sorry.

412
00:31:18,040 --> 00:31:19,040
Don't mention it.

413
00:31:19,040 --> 00:31:20,040
It's all a white wine.

414
00:31:20,040 --> 00:31:23,040
My mom is using it as a

415
00:31:23,040 --> 00:31:24,040
waste of money.

416
00:31:27,040 --> 00:31:30,040
This word is not so useful.

417
00:31:32,040 --> 00:31:33,040
What?

418
00:31:33,040 --> 00:31:34,040
Then let's talk about it.

419
00:31:34,040 --> 00:31:36,040
I'm with Xiao Qiao.

420
00:31:36,040 --> 00:31:38,040
It's a river of love.

421
00:31:43,040 --> 00:31:44,040
I'm so tired.

422
00:31:45,040 --> 00:31:46,040
I'm tired.

423
00:31:48,040 --> 00:31:49,040
Cigarette.

424
00:31:49,040 --> 00:31:50,040
You are a little chubby.

425
00:31:52,040 --> 00:31:53,040
I'm sorry.

426
00:31:56,040 --> 00:31:57,040
That's all my fault.

427
00:31:57,040 --> 00:31:58,040
I'm sorry.

428
00:31:58,040 --> 00:31:59,040
I'm sorry again.

429
00:31:59,040 --> 00:32:00,040
I don't care.

430
00:32:00,040 --> 00:32:01,040
I'm sorry.

431
00:32:01,040 --> 00:32:02,040
I'm just sorry.

432
00:32:02,040 --> 00:32:03,040
I'm sorry.

433
00:32:03,040 --> 00:32:04,040
I'm sorry.

434
00:32:07,040 --> 00:32:08,040
I'm sorry.

435
00:32:08,040 --> 00:32:09,040
I'm sorry.

436
00:32:09,040 --> 00:32:10,040
I'm sorry.

437
00:32:11,040 --> 00:32:12,040
I'm sorry.

438
00:32:12,040 --> 00:32:13,040
I'm sorry.

439
00:32:13,040 --> 00:32:14,040
I'm sorry.

440
00:32:14,040 --> 00:32:15,040
I'm sorry.

441
00:32:15,040 --> 00:32:17,040
I won't be called a fool.

442
00:32:19,040 --> 00:32:23,040
Now, I'll help you unwind the seal.

443
00:32:33,040 --> 00:32:36,040
I'm born to be gentle and have a good relationship with the jade consort.

444
00:32:36,040 --> 00:32:40,040
I wish jade consort to have the seal of the right hand.

445
00:32:41,040 --> 00:32:43,040
I should have the freedom to be free from the jade consort.

446
00:32:43,040 --> 00:32:45,040
Do you want to choose like this?

447
00:32:46,040 --> 00:32:48,040
But I only have the choice.

448
00:32:49,040 --> 00:32:50,040
But I'm not.

449
00:32:52,040 --> 00:32:55,040
The bird should fly in the mountains and the mountains.

450
00:32:57,040 --> 00:32:59,040
It shouldn't be trapped in this dark room.

451
00:33:10,040 --> 00:33:12,040
I'm the only one who's willing to be the jade consort.

452
00:33:14,040 --> 00:33:17,040
The jade consort is indeed wrong.

453
00:33:19,040 --> 00:33:21,040
It's hard to judge.

454
00:33:26,040 --> 00:33:28,040
If you have a future,

455
00:33:30,040 --> 00:33:31,040
please tell me.

456
00:33:33,040 --> 00:33:35,040
I hope you can be a normal bird.

457
00:33:36,040 --> 00:33:39,040
You should meet new birds and be friends.

458
00:33:40,040 --> 00:33:44,040
Don't ever know me again.

459
00:34:11,040 --> 00:34:13,040
I'm the jade consort.

460
00:34:14,040 --> 00:34:16,040
I'm the jade consort.

461
00:34:17,040 --> 00:34:19,040
I'm the jade consort.

462
00:34:20,040 --> 00:34:22,040
I'm the jade consort.

463
00:34:23,040 --> 00:34:25,040
I'm the jade consort.

464
00:34:26,040 --> 00:34:28,040
I'm the jade consort.

465
00:34:29,040 --> 00:34:31,040
I'm the jade consort.

466
00:34:32,040 --> 00:34:34,040
I'm the jade consort.

467
00:34:35,040 --> 00:34:37,040
I'm the jade consort.

468
00:34:37,040 --> 00:34:40,040
So didn't nine hundred evolve my number?

469
00:34:42,040 --> 00:34:44,040
Or else, things would have changed.

470
00:34:45,040 --> 00:34:47,040
Be a jade consort.

471
00:34:48,040 --> 00:34:51,040
Don't ever fear.

472
00:34:51,040 --> 00:34:54,040
The jade consort is still having dreams,

473
00:34:54,040 --> 00:34:56,040
but it's tough for zero to dream.

474
00:34:58,040 --> 00:35:00,040
Be a jade consort.

475
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:05,040
Shun religious,

476
00:35:05,040 --> 00:35:07,040
What is this?

477
00:35:07,040 --> 00:35:09,040
This is a film of the shadow.

478
00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:13,040
It can make people escape into their dreams.

479
00:35:13,040 --> 00:35:16,040
The people who chose Chen Ji in their dreams

480
00:35:16,040 --> 00:35:19,040
are mostly trying to escape.

481
00:35:21,040 --> 00:35:25,040
Maybe they are not necessarily trying to escape,

482
00:35:25,040 --> 00:35:28,040
but rather, they are trying to escape.

483
00:35:30,040 --> 00:35:34,040
Who is the person who chose Chen Ji?

484
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:38,040
I was destined to go to the South.

485
00:35:38,040 --> 00:35:40,040
The South?

486
00:35:44,040 --> 00:35:47,040
Did you see the words I wrote?

487
00:35:50,040 --> 00:35:53,040
I saw them when I was young.

488
00:35:56,040 --> 00:35:59,040
I was destined to go to the South.

489
00:35:59,040 --> 00:36:03,040
The South was destined to go to the South.

490
00:36:03,040 --> 00:36:05,040
I have already been released.

491
00:36:05,040 --> 00:36:08,040
I finally can leave this place.

492
00:36:08,040 --> 00:36:10,040
I have been trapped for over 100 years.

493
00:36:10,040 --> 00:36:12,040
I am already crazy.

494
00:36:12,040 --> 00:36:14,040
I don't think he will leave.

495
00:36:14,040 --> 00:36:16,040
I think so too.

496
00:36:21,040 --> 00:36:24,040
The most hated demon Lord Zhuo and Lord Pei

497
00:36:24,040 --> 00:36:27,040
are now feeling the same way.

498
00:36:30,040 --> 00:36:32,040
Is he like this too?

499
00:36:34,040 --> 00:36:35,040
Yes.

500
00:36:35,040 --> 00:36:37,040
What?

501
00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:41,040
I am very angry.

502
00:37:03,040 --> 00:37:05,040
Be careful!

503
00:37:05,040 --> 00:37:07,040
Xiaojiu, come here!

504
00:37:07,040 --> 00:37:09,040
I am going to save you!

505
00:37:09,040 --> 00:37:11,040
It's okay!

506
00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:13,040
Xiaojiu! Xiaojiu!

507
00:37:34,040 --> 00:37:36,040
Xiaojiu.

508
00:37:40,040 --> 00:37:42,040
Xiaojiu.

509
00:37:48,040 --> 00:37:50,040
Xiaojiu.

510
00:37:52,040 --> 00:37:54,040
Xiao Zhuge.

511
00:37:54,040 --> 00:37:57,040
I just called you out for a few minutes.

512
00:37:58,040 --> 00:38:00,040
What's wrong?

513
00:38:01,040 --> 00:38:03,040
I thought of my mother.

514
00:38:07,040 --> 00:38:10,040
You are a demon that killed my mother.

515
00:38:10,040 --> 00:38:12,040
You are a tree.

516
00:38:12,040 --> 00:38:14,040
So...

517
00:38:14,040 --> 00:38:16,040
you are afraid of the tree?

518
00:38:20,040 --> 00:38:22,040
The tree is silent.

519
00:38:22,040 --> 00:38:24,040
But it is calm.

520
00:38:24,040 --> 00:38:26,040
It is tolerant.

521
00:38:26,040 --> 00:38:28,040
It can always absorb your bad emotions.

522
00:38:28,040 --> 00:38:30,040
It is a good thing that you are here.

523
00:38:30,040 --> 00:38:32,040
I am here to protect you.

524
00:38:32,040 --> 00:38:34,040
I am here to protect you.

525
00:38:34,040 --> 00:38:36,040
I am here to protect you.

526
00:38:36,040 --> 00:38:38,040
I am here to protect you.

527
00:38:38,040 --> 00:38:40,040
I am here to protect you.

528
00:38:40,040 --> 00:38:42,040
It can always absorb your bad emotions.

529
00:38:42,040 --> 00:38:44,040
When I was young,

530
00:38:44,040 --> 00:38:46,040
my father and brother went out for a rest.

531
00:38:48,040 --> 00:38:50,040
I was the only one who was there.

532
00:38:52,040 --> 00:38:55,040
I would say to the tree in the yard.

533
00:38:57,040 --> 00:38:59,040
Sometimes,

534
00:38:59,040 --> 00:39:01,040
I would treat it as my brother.

535
00:39:01,040 --> 00:39:03,040
I would cry and laugh at him.

536
00:39:05,040 --> 00:39:07,040
Finally,

537
00:39:07,040 --> 00:39:09,040
I fell asleep under the tree.

538
00:39:11,040 --> 00:39:13,040
Xiao Chen,

539
00:39:13,040 --> 00:39:15,040
what are you doing?

540
00:39:16,040 --> 00:39:18,040
I think my brother is very nice to the tree.

541
00:39:18,040 --> 00:39:20,040
I want to wear it too.

542
00:39:20,040 --> 00:39:24,040
The tree is not for the good looks.

543
00:39:24,040 --> 00:39:26,040
What is it for?

544
00:39:26,040 --> 00:39:29,040
It is to love yourself.

545
00:39:29,040 --> 00:39:31,040
I am so sorry.

546
00:39:40,040 --> 00:39:43,040
If it is good thats hurting your heart.

547
00:39:43,040 --> 00:39:45,040
Crazy heart,

548
00:39:45,040 --> 00:39:49,040
but sad heart,

549
00:39:50,040 --> 00:39:53,040
it is suffering.

550
00:39:53,040 --> 00:39:55,040
See.

551
00:39:56,040 --> 00:39:59,040
Your dad doesn't speak so well,

552
00:40:00,040 --> 00:40:03,040
I kind of not too afraid.

553
00:40:03,040 --> 00:40:03,760
What?

554
00:40:07,680 --> 00:40:09,040
So many demons in the world.

555
00:40:10,160 --> 00:40:11,120
Are you afraid?

556
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:14,160
All of them are demons.

557
00:40:16,800 --> 00:40:18,080
I'm afraid of you.

558
00:40:19,360 --> 00:40:21,680
But I was there when I was young.

559
00:40:22,320 --> 00:40:23,680
And Yu Wengjie, who's so good.

560
00:40:25,120 --> 00:40:26,320
I'm not that scared.

561
00:40:30,240 --> 00:40:31,200
It's definitely not a problem.

562
00:40:33,440 --> 00:40:44,560
Someone should cover it all up...

563
00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:55,360
A Halva

564
00:40:55,360 --> 00:40:58,400
You didn't get lost.

565
00:41:00,860 --> 00:41:05,760
Zhao Yanzhou loves you ponder for nothing

566
00:41:05,760 --> 00:41:15,100
