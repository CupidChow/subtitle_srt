1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
What do you think?

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:11,000
I'm going to make a new one.

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:16,000
I'm going to make a new one.

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:22,000
I'm going to make a new one.

5
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:27,000
I'm going to make a new one.

6
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:32,000
I'm going to make a new one.

7
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:37,000
I'm going to make a new one.

8
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:42,000
I'm going to make a new one.

9
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:47,000
I'm going to make a new one.

10
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:52,000
I'm going to make a new one.

11
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:57,000
I'm going to make a new one.

12
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:02,000
I'm going to make a new one.

13
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:07,000
I'm going to make a new one.

14
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:12,000
I'm going to make a new one.

15
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:17,000
I'm going to make a new one.

16
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:22,000
I'm going to make a new one.

17
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:27,000
I'm going to make a new one.

18
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:32,000
I'm going to make a new one.

19
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:37,000
I'm going to make a new one.

20
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:42,000
I'm going to make a new one.

21
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:48,600
someone good

22
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:59,360
God Sun and I all paid heed fight

23
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:04,480
A promise to the Zggi

24
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:06,300
It's dream

25
00:02:06,300 --> 00:02:10,600
More пис

26
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:12,600
I'm not a good person.

27
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:14,600
You're a good person.

28
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:16,600
I'm not a good person.

29
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:18,600
I'm not a good person.

30
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:20,600
I'm not a good person.

31
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:22,600
I'm not a good person.

32
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:24,600
I'm not a good person.

33
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:26,600
I'm not a good person.

34
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:28,600
I'm not a good person.

35
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:30,600
I'm not a good person.

36
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:32,600
I'm not a good person.

37
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:34,600
I'm not a good person.

38
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:36,600
I'm not a good person.

39
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:38,600
I'm not a good person.

40
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:42,600
How many years are you still singing?

41
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:46,600
The balance of fate.

42
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:54,600
I don't want to think about it.

43
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:04,600
I thought god and I

44
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:08,600
could be together forever.

45
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:12,600
I didn't expect that.

46
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:36,600
Mom, what's this mark?

47
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:40,600
This is Bai Ze Ling's mark.

48
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:44,600
With this mark, we can hide demons in the world.

49
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:46,600
It's not easy to be lost in the world.

50
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:48,600
Bai Ze Ling is there.

51
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:50,600
The world is the same.

52
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:54,600
You have to be good after you go to the world.

53
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:06,600
You come along.

54
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:08,600
I'll catch you if it最後.

55
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:10,600
Where are you going you three?

56
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:12,600
See you in the Dowry.

57
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:16,600
OK, bye.

58
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:18,600
Look, there is a big house.

59
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:22,600
Eyes full of girls in a long and short period of time.

60
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:24,600
Not yet.

61
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:26,600
This is snow,

62
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:28,600
but snow now.

63
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:30,600
After this,

64
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:33,900
Thearn is a good feelings for

65
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:35,720
I admit it.

66
00:04:36,060 --> 00:04:37,520
Until you get there,

67
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:39,580
I'll make sure the forest belongs to heaven.

68
00:04:39,580 --> 00:04:42,580
I won't allow you to z geographicalvarusion.

69
00:05:03,900 --> 00:05:05,900
I've searched the whole world.

70
00:05:05,900 --> 00:05:08,900
I haven't found the cure for plague.

71
00:05:24,900 --> 00:05:26,900
I searched the whole world.

72
00:05:26,900 --> 00:05:29,900
I haven't found the cure for plague.

73
00:05:34,900 --> 00:05:35,900
I told myself,

74
00:05:37,900 --> 00:05:39,900
no matter what price I pay,

75
00:05:40,900 --> 00:05:42,900
I will save her.

76
00:05:44,900 --> 00:05:46,900
You opened the sand world in the first place.

77
00:05:47,900 --> 00:05:49,900
Is it to give the god and the queen a life?

78
00:05:50,900 --> 00:05:51,900
I said it.

79
00:05:53,900 --> 00:05:55,900
As long as she can live,

80
00:05:58,900 --> 00:06:00,900
I can pay all the price.

81
00:06:00,900 --> 00:06:02,900
You've been in charge of the order of Bai Ze,

82
00:06:02,900 --> 00:06:04,900
you should protect the king.

83
00:06:05,900 --> 00:06:08,900
But you are indeed the life of the king.

84
00:06:10,900 --> 00:06:15,900
You committed a crime and said it was just a price.

85
00:06:16,900 --> 00:06:17,900
Bai Ze's god and queen

86
00:06:18,900 --> 00:06:21,900
were born to protect the two realms.

87
00:06:22,900 --> 00:06:27,900
If I can't even save the god and the queen,

88
00:06:27,900 --> 00:06:29,900
I will drink a lot of wine.

89
00:06:36,900 --> 00:06:40,900
I must make a step for her.

90
00:06:41,900 --> 00:06:43,900
Then will she let you go?

91
00:06:46,900 --> 00:06:48,900
You've been in charge of the order of Bai Ze,

92
00:06:48,900 --> 00:06:50,900
but you killed the innocent.

93
00:06:51,900 --> 00:06:53,900
You committed a crime.

94
00:06:54,900 --> 00:06:56,900
I killed the innocent.

95
00:06:57,900 --> 00:06:59,900
You committed a crime.

96
00:07:00,900 --> 00:07:02,900
The world is in a difficult situation.

97
00:07:08,900 --> 00:07:10,900
You remember your mistake.

98
00:07:11,900 --> 00:07:13,900
Why do you still have to make a name for yourself?

99
00:07:14,900 --> 00:07:16,900
It's because...

100
00:07:28,900 --> 00:07:30,900
It's because they don't obey the rules.

101
00:07:31,900 --> 00:07:33,900
They are talking nonsense.

102
00:07:34,900 --> 00:07:36,900
So they should die.

103
00:07:46,900 --> 00:07:48,900
No matter what you do,

104
00:07:50,900 --> 00:07:52,900
you can't do it.

105
00:07:57,900 --> 00:08:02,900
You are no longer suitable for the order of Bai Ze.

106
00:08:15,900 --> 00:08:17,900
I will take back half of your body.

107
00:08:27,900 --> 00:08:29,900
I will take back half of your body.

108
00:08:30,900 --> 00:08:32,900
I will take back half of your body.

109
00:08:33,900 --> 00:08:35,900
I will take back half of your body.

110
00:08:36,900 --> 00:08:38,900
I will take back half of your body.

111
00:08:39,900 --> 00:08:41,900
I will take back half of your body.

112
00:08:42,900 --> 00:08:44,900
I will take back half of your body.

113
00:08:45,900 --> 00:08:47,900
I will take back half of your body.

114
00:08:48,900 --> 00:08:50,900
I will take back half of your body.

115
00:08:51,900 --> 00:08:53,900
I will take back half of your body.

116
00:08:54,900 --> 00:08:56,900
I will take back half of your body.

117
00:08:57,900 --> 00:09:00,900
I will take back half of your body.

118
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:29,900
I will take back half of your body.

119
00:09:44,900 --> 00:09:48,900
The goddess's will is to seal me.

120
00:09:50,900 --> 00:09:54,900
But she is very gentle and unknowingly.

121
00:09:57,900 --> 00:09:59,900
She is very gentle and unknowingly.

122
00:10:00,900 --> 00:10:02,900
She is very gentle and unknowingly.

123
00:10:03,900 --> 00:10:05,900
She is very gentle and unknowingly.

124
00:10:06,900 --> 00:10:08,900
She is very gentle and unknowingly.

125
00:10:09,900 --> 00:10:11,900
She is very gentle and unknowingly.

126
00:10:12,900 --> 00:10:14,900
She is very gentle and unknowingly.

127
00:10:15,900 --> 00:10:17,900
She is very gentle and unknowingly.

128
00:10:18,900 --> 00:10:20,900
She is very gentle and unknowingly.

129
00:10:21,900 --> 00:10:23,900
She is very gentle and unknowingly.

130
00:10:24,900 --> 00:10:26,900
She is very gentle and unknowingly.

131
00:10:28,900 --> 00:10:30,900
She is very gentle and unknowingly.

132
00:10:31,900 --> 00:10:33,900
She is very gentle and unknowingly.

133
00:10:37,900 --> 00:10:39,900
I got out when she had to be taken.

134
00:10:57,900 --> 00:11:01,900
I thought you wanted to secretly kill the demon

135
00:11:01,900 --> 00:11:05,900
in the royal palace

136
00:11:05,900 --> 00:11:09,900
to kill him

137
00:11:09,900 --> 00:11:12,900
to kill the one you love

138
00:11:12,900 --> 00:11:15,900
You are too crazy

139
00:11:15,900 --> 00:11:18,900
I only know how to change

140
00:11:18,900 --> 00:11:22,900
who said I don't regret

141
00:11:22,900 --> 00:11:26,900
I regret

142
00:11:26,900 --> 00:11:30,900
I regret I didn't do enough

143
00:11:30,900 --> 00:11:34,900
I didn't save him

144
00:11:34,900 --> 00:11:37,900
Maybe you know everything

145
00:11:37,900 --> 00:11:40,900
You don't want to continue to make mistakes

146
00:11:40,900 --> 00:11:43,900
That's why you committed suicide

147
00:11:43,900 --> 00:11:47,900
What did you say?

148
00:11:47,900 --> 00:11:51,900
But you have been ill for many years

149
00:11:51,900 --> 00:11:55,900
Why did you kill Wu Gu again?

150
00:11:55,900 --> 00:11:59,900
Zhou Yun Zhong

151
00:11:59,900 --> 00:12:03,900
What is your desire?

152
00:12:03,900 --> 00:12:07,900
I want to have everything

153
00:12:07,900 --> 00:12:09,900
What do you want?

154
00:12:09,900 --> 00:12:11,900
What I want is

155
00:12:11,900 --> 00:12:15,900
what I can get

156
00:12:15,900 --> 00:12:19,900
It's also

157
00:12:19,900 --> 00:12:22,900
I don't die long

158
00:12:22,900 --> 00:12:26,900
The super power of the Yusheng

159
00:12:26,900 --> 00:12:29,900
has made all the demons

160
00:12:29,900 --> 00:12:32,900
jealous of you

161
00:12:32,900 --> 00:12:34,900
The Yusheng slowly

162
00:12:34,900 --> 00:12:38,900
went back to the dark path

163
00:12:38,900 --> 00:12:41,900
I can't see the future

164
00:12:41,900 --> 00:12:44,900
without it

165
00:12:44,900 --> 00:12:47,900
Maybe I'm the only one who can resist

166
00:12:47,900 --> 00:12:51,900
I'm the one who is suffering

167
00:12:51,900 --> 00:12:57,900
Death is the only way to get rid of it

168
00:12:57,900 --> 00:13:01,900
Since you want to die

169
00:13:01,900 --> 00:13:04,900
why not die?

170
00:13:04,900 --> 00:13:07,900
I'm willing to die

171
00:13:07,900 --> 00:13:10,900
in the name of the Yusheng

172
00:13:14,900 --> 00:13:16,900
I can help you

173
00:13:16,900 --> 00:13:18,900
No

174
00:13:18,900 --> 00:13:21,900
I've made an agreement with someone

175
00:13:21,900 --> 00:13:24,900
He will come to kill me

176
00:13:30,900 --> 00:13:33,900
He will also come

177
00:13:38,900 --> 00:13:41,900
Zhao Yuan Zhong is dying

178
00:13:41,900 --> 00:13:45,900
Why don't I kill him for you?

179
00:13:45,900 --> 00:13:48,900
Your wish is achieved

180
00:13:48,900 --> 00:13:52,900
He will also die

181
00:13:52,900 --> 00:13:56,900
I will kill him

182
00:13:56,900 --> 00:14:00,900
with the peace between him and me

183
00:14:00,900 --> 00:14:04,900
No need for anyone's help

184
00:14:07,900 --> 00:14:10,900
It's been tens of thousands of years

185
00:14:10,900 --> 00:14:14,900
What is the purpose of the tears?

186
00:14:16,900 --> 00:14:19,900
I made a big mistake

187
00:14:19,900 --> 00:14:23,900
killing demons and killing demons

188
00:14:23,900 --> 00:14:27,900
to make the Goddess hate me

189
00:14:30,900 --> 00:14:33,900
So I think

190
00:14:33,900 --> 00:14:36,900
if I can go back to the past

191
00:14:36,900 --> 00:14:39,900
and go back to the past

192
00:14:39,900 --> 00:14:42,900
and go back to my hands

193
00:14:42,900 --> 00:14:46,900
and go back to the blood of the Zhangmen

194
00:14:47,900 --> 00:14:51,900
we still want to go back to the past

195
00:14:54,900 --> 00:14:57,900
What do you want to do?

196
00:15:02,900 --> 00:15:05,900
The world turns around

197
00:15:05,900 --> 00:15:09,900
and the time goes back

198
00:15:13,900 --> 00:15:16,900
The world turns around

199
00:15:21,900 --> 00:15:24,900
This Japanese magic can be done

200
00:15:24,900 --> 00:15:28,900
As long as I'm satisfied with enough mortal wishes

201
00:15:28,900 --> 00:15:33,900
this magic will gradually become stronger

202
00:15:34,900 --> 00:15:37,900
One day

203
00:15:37,900 --> 00:15:41,900
he will turn around and go back to the past

204
00:15:42,900 --> 00:15:46,900
until the Goddess is infected

205
00:15:46,900 --> 00:15:49,900
until

206
00:15:49,900 --> 00:15:53,900
everything is not too late

207
00:15:55,900 --> 00:15:57,900
What are you laughing at?

208
00:15:57,900 --> 00:16:00,900
I'm laughing at your dream

209
00:16:00,900 --> 00:16:04,900
to turn around and go back to the past

210
00:16:05,900 --> 00:16:08,900
Why did he give you this?

211
00:16:08,900 --> 00:16:10,900
Because he wants to know

212
00:16:10,900 --> 00:16:12,900
the secret of the White-Haired Lord

213
00:16:12,900 --> 00:16:15,900
What is the secret of the White-Haired Lord?

214
00:16:21,900 --> 00:16:23,900
You are so pitiful

215
00:16:23,900 --> 00:16:25,900
You are cheated by Lilan

216
00:16:35,900 --> 00:16:38,900
Lilan didn't cheat me

217
00:16:38,900 --> 00:16:41,900
It's your pig's eye child

218
00:16:41,900 --> 00:16:44,900
who wants to cheat me

219
00:16:44,900 --> 00:16:47,900
This Japanese magic

220
00:16:47,900 --> 00:16:51,900
is the magic I got from Lilan

221
00:16:51,900 --> 00:16:54,900
He has only one ability

222
00:16:54,900 --> 00:16:57,900
It's to have memory

223
00:16:57,900 --> 00:17:00,900
and not turn around and go back to the past

224
00:17:04,900 --> 00:17:08,900
I will turn around and go back to the past

225
00:17:08,900 --> 00:17:10,900
until

226
00:17:10,900 --> 00:17:13,900
everything is not too late

227
00:17:13,900 --> 00:17:17,900
I'm sorry

228
00:17:17,900 --> 00:17:20,900
I'll turn around and go back to the past

229
00:17:20,900 --> 00:17:22,900
until

230
00:17:22,900 --> 00:17:25,900
everything is not too late

231
00:17:25,900 --> 00:17:28,900
I will turn around and go back to the past

232
00:17:28,900 --> 00:17:31,900
until

233
00:17:31,900 --> 00:17:34,900
everything is not too late

234
00:17:37,900 --> 00:17:39,900
Did you see that?

235
00:17:39,900 --> 00:17:42,900
There are two realms in this world

236
00:17:42,900 --> 00:17:44,900
The mountains and seas are the same

237
00:17:44,900 --> 00:17:47,900
There is no way that there is a magic

238
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:50,900
that is in the sky

239
00:17:51,900 --> 00:17:54,900
Chen Huang

240
00:17:54,900 --> 00:17:57,900
The end is certain

241
00:17:58,900 --> 00:18:01,900
The past is the past

242
00:18:01,900 --> 00:18:04,900
I can't do anything

243
00:18:06,900 --> 00:18:09,900
You cheated me

244
00:18:11,900 --> 00:18:14,900
You are cheating me

245
00:18:16,900 --> 00:18:19,900
The person who cheated you

246
00:18:19,900 --> 00:18:22,900
is Lilan

247
00:18:28,900 --> 00:18:31,900
He is crazy

248
00:18:31,900 --> 00:18:34,900
The past is the past

249
00:18:34,900 --> 00:18:37,900
I can't do anything

250
00:18:37,900 --> 00:18:40,900
Chen Huang

251
00:18:40,900 --> 00:18:43,900
is your love

252
00:18:43,900 --> 00:18:46,900
Everyone has a chance

253
00:18:46,900 --> 00:18:49,900
But the world is fair

254
00:18:49,900 --> 00:18:52,900
Everything can't be turned around

255
00:18:52,900 --> 00:18:54,900
Chen Huang

256
00:18:54,900 --> 00:18:57,900
You admit your love

257
00:18:57,900 --> 00:19:00,900
Don't let Chen Mi take the past

258
00:19:00,900 --> 00:19:03,900
The water is in the water

259
00:19:06,900 --> 00:19:09,900
I will cheat you

260
00:19:25,900 --> 00:19:28,900
Chen Huang is the oldest friend of the Great Huang

261
00:19:28,900 --> 00:19:30,900
He is so excited now

262
00:19:30,900 --> 00:19:32,900
I'm afraid he can't do anything

263
00:19:32,900 --> 00:19:34,900
with Lilan

264
00:19:54,900 --> 00:19:57,900
Chen Huang

265
00:19:57,900 --> 00:20:00,900
is the oldest friend of the Great Huang

266
00:20:00,900 --> 00:20:03,900
He is so excited now

267
00:20:03,900 --> 00:20:06,900
He is so excited now

268
00:20:06,900 --> 00:20:09,900
He is so excited now

269
00:20:09,900 --> 00:20:12,900
He is so excited now

270
00:20:12,900 --> 00:20:15,900
He is so excited now

271
00:20:15,900 --> 00:20:18,900
He is so excited now

272
00:20:18,900 --> 00:20:21,900
He is so excited now

273
00:20:21,900 --> 00:20:24,900
He is so excited now

274
00:20:24,900 --> 00:20:27,900
He is so excited now

275
00:20:27,900 --> 00:20:30,900
He is so excited now

276
00:20:30,900 --> 00:20:33,900
He is so excited now

277
00:20:33,900 --> 00:20:36,900
He is so excited now

278
00:20:36,900 --> 00:20:39,900
He is so excited now

279
00:20:39,900 --> 00:20:42,900
He is so excited now

280
00:20:42,900 --> 00:20:45,900
He is so excited now

281
00:20:45,900 --> 00:20:48,900
He is so excited now

282
00:20:48,900 --> 00:20:51,900
He is so excited now

283
00:20:51,900 --> 00:20:54,900
He is so excited now

284
00:20:54,900 --> 00:20:57,900
He is so excited now

285
00:20:57,900 --> 00:21:00,900
He is so excited now

286
00:21:00,900 --> 00:21:03,900
He is so excited now

287
00:21:04,900 --> 00:21:06,900
Bai Zelen was the first one

288
00:21:06,900 --> 00:21:08,900
She was second

289
00:21:08,900 --> 00:21:10,900
She was the strongest

290
00:21:10,900 --> 00:21:12,900
and the strongest

291
00:21:12,900 --> 00:21:14,900
one in the Great Huang

292
00:21:14,900 --> 00:21:16,060
Me too.

293
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:19,540
I did it.

294
00:21:44,900 --> 00:21:49,520
A

295
00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:54,800
Previously

296
00:22:04,220 --> 00:22:06,800
The

297
00:22:07,800 --> 00:22:09,840
first

298
00:22:10,280 --> 00:22:12,560
why

299
00:22:12,560 --> 00:22:15,780
White sexy represents a powerful blood

300
00:22:15,780 --> 00:22:18,380
We give attention to images

301
00:22:38,360 --> 00:22:41,040
Is this the trust in hand beforehand?

302
00:23:12,560 --> 00:23:14,560
Soon after leaving, Bai Zai Li...

303
00:23:29,240 --> 00:23:30,240
Bai Zai Li...

304
00:23:33,240 --> 00:23:34,480
I finally found someone.

305
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:40,200
I got some from my dad.

306
00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:42,200
I will come back eventually.

307
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:12,200
I will come back eventually.

308
00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:42,200
I will come back eventually.

309
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:30,200
I will come back eventually.

310
00:25:30,200 --> 00:25:40,200
I will come back eventually.

311
00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:06,200
Bai Ze Ling is back.

312
00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:12,200
It's really worth the time.

313
00:26:12,200 --> 00:26:32,200
It seems that my wish can come true.

314
00:26:42,200 --> 00:27:02,200
I will come back eventually.

315
00:27:02,200 --> 00:27:04,200
No, no, no.

316
00:27:12,200 --> 00:27:14,200
How could this happen?

317
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:20,200
Shouldn't he be sealed and go to the place of birth?

318
00:27:20,200 --> 00:27:22,200
Is he too poor to live?

319
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:25,200
Bai Ze Ling has been unworthy of him.

320
00:27:26,200 --> 00:27:27,200
It's impossible.

321
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:30,200
Bai Ze Ling is important to the child.

322
00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:34,200
As long as he is, he will be sealed.

323
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:36,200
Unless...

324
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:39,200
Hurry up and look at the hands of the King.

325
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:48,200
Is he too poor?

326
00:27:56,200 --> 00:27:57,200
Yes.

327
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:11,200
If I can let time go by and stay,

328
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:16,200
then he can be re-released.

329
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:19,200
How good would that be?

330
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:27,200
I will come back eventually.

331
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:29,200
I will come back eventually.

332
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:31,200
I will come back eventually.

333
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:33,200
I will come back eventually.

334
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:35,200
I will come back eventually.

335
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:37,200
I will come back eventually.

336
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:39,200
I will come back eventually.

337
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:41,200
I will come back eventually.

338
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:43,200
I will come back eventually.

339
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:45,200
I will come back eventually.

340
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:47,200
I will come back eventually.

341
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:49,200
I will come back eventually.

342
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:51,200
I will come back eventually.

343
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:53,200
I will come back eventually.

344
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:55,200
I will come back eventually.

345
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:57,200
I will come back eventually.

346
00:28:57,200 --> 00:28:59,200
I will come back eventually.

347
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:01,200
I will come back eventually.

348
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:03,200
I will come back eventually.

349
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:05,200
I will come back eventually.

350
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:07,200
I will come back eventually.

351
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:09,200
I will come back eventually.

352
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:11,200
I will come back eventually.

353
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:13,200
I will come back eventually.

354
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:15,200
I will come back eventually.

355
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:17,200
I will come back eventually.

356
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:19,200
I will come back eventually.

357
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:21,200
I will come back eventually.

358
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:23,200
I will come back eventually.

359
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:25,200
I will come back eventually.

360
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:27,200
I hope that my departure

361
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:29,200
can end your way.

362
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:33,200
Don't do anything for me again.

363
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:35,200
I didn't belong to your sins.

364
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:49,200
There's no right or wrong in the world.

365
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:51,200
I'm still confused.

366
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:53,200
I can't write it down.

367
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:55,200
How can I not know?

368
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:57,200
I can't write it down.

369
00:29:57,200 --> 00:29:59,200
The heart is in the palace.

370
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:02,200
The hand is in the fire.

371
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:15,200
The wind blows hard.

372
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:18,200
There are too many stars.

373
00:30:18,200 --> 00:30:24,200
There is a white mark on the sky.

374
00:30:24,200 --> 00:30:28,200
The white clouds in the crowd.

375
00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:30,200
The lonely scene.

376
00:30:30,200 --> 00:30:36,200
A dream, a handshake, a cup of wine.

377
00:30:36,200 --> 00:30:40,200
The small boat is trapped.

378
00:30:40,200 --> 00:30:43,200
The small boat is us.

379
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:49,200
The circle of the circle is in the soul.

380
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:53,200
The door in the city is behind.

381
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:55,200
Who is the youth?

382
00:30:55,200 --> 00:31:01,200
I don't want to ask, I don't dare, I don't dare.

383
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:06,200
I'm waiting, I'm waiting.

384
00:31:06,200 --> 00:31:08,200
No wonder the emperor is so long-winded.

385
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:10,200
So he was already a human.

386
00:31:10,200 --> 00:31:13,200
And his obsession has strengthened

387
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:18,200
to make a human have the same strength as the real medicine.

388
00:31:32,200 --> 00:31:33,200
No.

389
00:31:36,200 --> 00:31:38,200
The storm has been solved.

390
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:41,200
The sun is shining.

391
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:43,200
Why is there no sun?

392
00:31:48,200 --> 00:31:51,200
You and Li Lun found the sun.

393
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:53,200
Zhao Yanzhao, do something.

394
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:55,200
I didn't.

395
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:57,200
But the godess.

396
00:31:58,200 --> 00:31:59,200
Me?

397
00:32:02,200 --> 00:32:04,200
I know.

398
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:11,200
So beautiful.

399
00:32:14,200 --> 00:32:17,200
Wenxiang, how did you lose?

400
00:32:20,200 --> 00:32:23,200
I mean, this pair of gold coins are so beautiful.

401
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:36,200
So these eyes won't be like this forever?

402
00:32:36,200 --> 00:32:41,200
Only when I use the power of the white spirit will I have the gold coins.

403
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:45,200
Do you think this pair of gold coins are the way to do it?

404
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:47,200
The exit of Japanese is actually not difficult.

405
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:50,200
The white gold coins can break all the hope.

406
00:32:50,200 --> 00:32:53,200
It's actually a more powerful magic.

407
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:56,200
You are the power of the white goddess.

408
00:32:56,200 --> 00:32:59,200
The power of the blood in your veins.

409
00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:03,200
You can lose the real thing as long as you know it.

410
00:33:04,200 --> 00:33:07,200
The power of the blood in your veins.

411
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:10,200
You can lose the real thing as long as you know it.

412
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:37,200
The black and white sky is so hard to see.

413
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:41,200
The black and white sky is so hard to see.

414
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:46,200
The border of the world is so far away.

415
00:33:46,200 --> 00:33:49,200
Someone is missing.

416
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:52,200
The love is so far away.

417
00:33:52,200 --> 00:33:54,200
I'm back.

418
00:33:54,200 --> 00:33:57,200
It's like a dream.

419
00:33:58,200 --> 00:34:01,200
From the start of the dark,

420
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:04,200
it seems like a dream.

421
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:10,200
Now that the white spirit is back,

422
00:34:10,200 --> 00:34:14,200
I think you can rest assured.

423
00:34:16,200 --> 00:34:18,200
The moon is so beautiful tonight.

424
00:34:18,200 --> 00:34:23,200
Xiao Zhuo said that the moon is like water to you.

425
00:34:23,200 --> 00:34:26,200
The moon is like water.

426
00:34:26,200 --> 00:34:29,200
The light and the mirror are so beautiful.

427
00:34:29,200 --> 00:34:31,200
Most of them are so beautiful.

428
00:34:31,200 --> 00:34:34,200
Don't be so selfish.

429
00:34:34,200 --> 00:34:36,200
Okay.

430
00:34:42,200 --> 00:34:47,200
I'm also curious about what kind of water this is.

431
00:34:47,200 --> 00:34:50,200
Give me a taste.

432
00:34:54,200 --> 00:34:57,200
It's so bitter.

433
00:35:00,200 --> 00:35:02,200
Time is so short.

434
00:35:02,200 --> 00:35:05,200
I'm not surprised that you're suffering.

435
00:35:06,200 --> 00:35:08,200
It's so bitter.

436
00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:13,200
Time is so short.

437
00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:16,200
I'm not surprised that you're suffering.

438
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:19,200
I'm so curious about what kind of water this is.

439
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:22,200
I suspect that your real life is not a monkey.

440
00:35:22,200 --> 00:35:24,200
It's a stage.

441
00:35:24,200 --> 00:35:26,200
I'm a noble white spirit.

442
00:35:26,200 --> 00:35:28,200
I've lost a hundred times.

443
00:35:28,200 --> 00:35:31,200
You're always taking a notebook and pretending to be a monkey.

444
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:33,200
You're always taking a notebook and pretending to be a monkey.

445
00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:35,200
It's useless.

446
00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:49,200
What are you drinking?

447
00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:51,200
Blood soup.

448
00:35:52,200 --> 00:35:55,200
Give me a sip too.

449
00:35:55,200 --> 00:35:58,200
Xiaozhou boiled a big pot of brain.

450
00:35:58,200 --> 00:36:01,200
I'll let it be a bowl for you.

451
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:04,200
No more drinking.

452
00:36:16,200 --> 00:36:19,200
I want to go back to Kunlun Mountain.

453
00:36:20,200 --> 00:36:25,200
I'm not in a good mood to lead the white spirit.

454
00:36:26,200 --> 00:36:30,200
I haven't found the medicine for the two white spirits.

455
00:36:30,200 --> 00:36:37,200
So I want to go back to Da Hong and see if I can find the young and old people.

456
00:36:40,200 --> 00:36:44,200
The medicine is good for your health.

457
00:36:44,200 --> 00:36:47,200
But it's not good for you.

458
00:36:49,200 --> 00:36:54,200
I'm not a good girl.

459
00:37:05,200 --> 00:37:11,200
Before, when all the demons heard my name,

460
00:37:11,200 --> 00:37:18,200
they were afraid, frightened, and worried.

461
00:37:20,200 --> 00:37:25,200
But soon they found out that I'm not a good spirit.

462
00:37:25,200 --> 00:37:30,200
I can't help them and I can't control them.

463
00:37:33,200 --> 00:37:37,200
So I learned so much about the medicine.

464
00:37:37,200 --> 00:37:40,200
I hope I can help them.

465
00:37:41,200 --> 00:37:48,200
But it's still useless.

466
00:37:55,200 --> 00:37:56,200
No.

467
00:37:56,200 --> 00:38:00,200
You're more than a 30,000 year old demon.

468
00:38:00,200 --> 00:38:03,200
And now the white spirit is back.

469
00:38:03,200 --> 00:38:05,200
You won't be weak anymore.

470
00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:07,200
Your health will get better.

471
00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:10,200
It will get better.

472
00:38:10,200 --> 00:38:16,200
No wonder I feel better on the way back from Qinghu.

473
00:38:16,200 --> 00:38:22,200
Even the number of demons in the room didn't affect me.

474
00:38:22,200 --> 00:38:28,200
Maybe it's because you've been by my side.

475
00:38:28,200 --> 00:38:33,200
The white spirit in your body has been giving me strength.

476
00:38:33,200 --> 00:38:35,200
Will it be me?

477
00:38:35,200 --> 00:38:38,200
Will the white spirit be you?

478
00:38:38,200 --> 00:38:40,200
I don't have any.

479
00:38:44,200 --> 00:38:46,200
Okay, okay.

480
00:38:46,200 --> 00:38:48,200
I'm a big demon.

481
00:38:48,200 --> 00:38:51,200
I can't stop my eyes.

482
00:38:51,200 --> 00:38:53,200
Awesome.

483
00:38:58,200 --> 00:39:00,200
I can't help you.

484
00:39:01,200 --> 00:39:04,200
It's okay if you can't eat it.

485
00:39:05,200 --> 00:39:08,200
But I want to eat you.

486
00:39:08,200 --> 00:39:10,200
Why should I eat you?

487
00:39:10,200 --> 00:39:12,200
I'm not sick.

488
00:39:13,200 --> 00:39:16,200
You want me to eat you?

489
00:39:19,200 --> 00:39:21,200
Here.

490
00:39:31,200 --> 00:39:34,200
You want to cure a very bad demon.

491
00:39:34,200 --> 00:39:36,200
You're sick too.

492
00:39:36,200 --> 00:39:38,200
Here.

493
00:39:42,200 --> 00:39:44,200
When are we going to Kunlun?

494
00:39:44,200 --> 00:39:46,200
I'll go with you to Kunlun.

495
00:39:51,200 --> 00:39:53,200
Lord Xiao Zhuo.

496
00:39:53,200 --> 00:39:55,200
I won't give up.

497
00:39:55,200 --> 00:39:57,200
I'll go with you.

498
00:39:57,200 --> 00:39:59,200
Lord Xiao Zhuo.

499
00:39:59,200 --> 00:40:02,200
I won't give up on you and this thing.

500
00:40:04,200 --> 00:40:06,200
Lord Xiao Zhuo.

501
00:40:14,200 --> 00:40:16,200
Take me with you.

502
00:40:18,200 --> 00:40:20,200
Brother Xiao Zhuo, take me with you.

503
00:40:22,200 --> 00:40:24,200
Okay.

504
00:40:24,200 --> 00:40:26,200
That's great.

505
00:40:27,200 --> 00:40:30,200
What's so good about Lord Xiao Zhuo's hand?

506
00:40:34,200 --> 00:40:36,200
Snow pear soup.

507
00:40:37,200 --> 00:40:39,200
I've already had it.

508
00:40:39,200 --> 00:40:41,200
So it's for me?

509
00:40:42,200 --> 00:40:45,200
Nonsense. I'm here to feed the dogs.

510
00:40:48,200 --> 00:40:51,200
I mean, I...

511
00:40:52,200 --> 00:40:54,200
I...

512
00:40:54,200 --> 00:40:56,200
You...

513
00:40:58,200 --> 00:41:00,200
You...

514
00:41:04,200 --> 00:41:06,200
You want to save me?

515
00:41:11,200 --> 00:41:13,200
Brother Xiao Zhuo, wait for me.

516
00:41:13,200 --> 00:41:15,200
Brother Xiao Zhuo.

517
00:41:15,200 --> 00:41:17,200
Thank goodness you didn't drink.

518
00:41:27,200 --> 00:41:29,200
Brother Xiao Zhuo.

519
00:41:29,200 --> 00:41:31,200
I'm here to feed the dogs.

520
00:41:31,200 --> 00:41:33,200
I'll go with you.

521
00:41:33,200 --> 00:41:35,200
Okay.

522
00:41:35,200 --> 00:41:37,200
I'll go with you.

523
00:41:37,200 --> 00:41:39,200
Okay.

524
00:41:39,200 --> 00:41:41,200
Okay.

525
00:41:41,200 --> 00:41:43,200
Brother Xiao Zhuo.

526
00:41:43,200 --> 00:41:45,200
I'll go with you.

527
00:41:45,200 --> 00:41:47,200
Okay.

528
00:41:47,200 --> 00:41:49,200
Okay.

529
00:41:49,200 --> 00:41:51,200
Okay.

530
00:41:51,200 --> 00:41:53,200
Okay.

531
00:41:53,200 --> 00:41:55,200
Okay.

532
00:41:55,200 --> 00:41:57,200
I don't know what will happen.

533
00:41:57,200 --> 00:42:00,200
I'm sure I'll encounter a lot of monsters.

534
00:42:00,200 --> 00:42:02,200
Aren't you afraid?

535
00:42:12,200 --> 00:42:14,200
Xiao Qing.

536
00:42:17,200 --> 00:42:19,200
I'm not afraid of that.

537
00:42:22,200 --> 00:42:24,200
Why do you still hold my leader?

538
00:42:25,200 --> 00:42:27,200
I'm a coward.

539
00:42:27,200 --> 00:42:30,200
But I only heard your bell sound.

540
00:42:30,200 --> 00:42:34,200
I knew that when Brother Xiao Zhuo was with me,

541
00:42:34,200 --> 00:42:36,200
I would feel safe.

542
00:42:36,200 --> 00:42:38,200
I'm not afraid of monsters.

543
00:42:42,200 --> 00:42:44,200
Lord Zhuo.

544
00:42:44,200 --> 00:42:47,200
Why do you always have a bell on your head?

545
00:42:56,200 --> 00:42:58,200
When I was a kid,

546
00:42:58,200 --> 00:43:01,200
my brother and I always liked to practice in the garden.

547
00:43:05,200 --> 00:43:07,200
He took me away

548
00:43:07,200 --> 00:43:11,200
and helped me a lot on my own.

549
00:43:14,200 --> 00:43:17,200
As long as the bell was around,

550
00:43:17,200 --> 00:43:19,200
he was right.

551
00:43:19,200 --> 00:43:21,200
I didn't run away.

552
00:43:25,200 --> 00:43:27,200
I didn't notice

553
00:43:27,200 --> 00:43:31,200
that you were still in the old place

554
00:43:31,200 --> 00:43:35,200
when I was a kid.

555
00:43:35,200 --> 00:43:38,200
So, when I first met you,

556
00:43:38,200 --> 00:43:42,200
I saw your bell on your head.

557
00:43:42,200 --> 00:43:45,200
I liked myself.

558
00:43:45,200 --> 00:43:49,200
My bell was brought by my brother.

559
00:43:49,200 --> 00:43:52,200
He was afraid that I would be lost,

560
00:43:52,200 --> 00:43:54,200
