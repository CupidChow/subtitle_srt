[Episode 13]

3
00:01:47,750 --> 00:01:50,210
I was afraid of causing the plague to spread,

4
00:01:50,270 --> 00:01:52,710
so I went to live in the cave alone.

5
00:01:55,070 --> 00:01:57,530
There's no concept of time in the mountains.

6
00:01:58,310 --> 00:02:01,640
When the cold weather ends, I don't even know what year it is.

7
00:02:01,670 --> 00:02:02,750
Life is short,

8
00:02:05,870 --> 00:02:07,200
but loneliness is long.

9
00:02:08,830 --> 00:02:09,949
Finally, one day,

10
00:02:10,750 --> 00:02:12,240
I couldn't help it

11
00:02:13,350 --> 00:02:15,350
and went to a town where humans live.

12
00:02:17,079 --> 00:02:18,680
That's where I met Qing Geng.

13
00:02:23,350 --> 00:02:25,710
Qing Geng was the first friend I made.

14
00:02:26,670 --> 00:02:27,630
I was very happy.

15
00:02:28,430 --> 00:02:30,890
Since I went to the town to see Qing Geng a lot,

16
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:32,910
the plague finally spread.

17
00:02:35,310 --> 00:02:36,570
It was all because of me

18
00:02:37,630 --> 00:02:39,190
that the mortal world I love

19
00:02:40,670 --> 00:02:42,310
turned into a hell.

20
00:02:51,750 --> 00:02:54,750
Since Qing Geng can suppress the source of the plague,

21
00:02:55,350 --> 00:02:57,950
the Baize Goddess could only seal us together.

22
00:03:04,420 --> 00:03:06,630
Am I being too delusional?

23
00:03:07,750 --> 00:03:09,680
I actually want to cure the plague.

24
00:03:11,750 --> 00:03:13,510
Don't be too hard on yourself.

25
00:03:15,150 --> 00:03:16,300
It's all because of you!

26
00:03:16,300 --> 00:03:17,900
I don't want to see you again!

27
00:03:23,070 --> 00:03:23,870
Because of me,

28
00:03:26,030 --> 00:03:27,230
she's trapped

29
00:03:27,230 --> 00:03:30,030

[God Bless Lingxi]

31
00:03:33,190 --> 00:03:34,270
My existence

32
00:03:35,550 --> 00:03:37,610
is Qing Geng's greatest misfortune.

33
00:03:42,750 --> 00:03:43,950
This is my inner core.

34
00:03:45,190 --> 00:03:45,980
Wait.

35
00:03:47,390 --> 00:03:48,630
Could the method

36
00:03:50,829 --> 00:03:52,430
you were talking about be...

37
00:04:04,190 --> 00:04:05,390
As long as I die,

38
00:04:07,430 --> 00:04:09,150
the plague will be gone.

39
00:04:18,790 --> 00:04:19,589
Please.

40
00:04:23,230 --> 00:04:24,510
Don't kill her.

41
00:04:26,110 --> 00:04:27,870
If Qing Geng were gone,

42
00:04:30,030 --> 00:04:31,350
I'd have no friends

43
00:04:32,870 --> 00:04:34,710
in this world anymore.

44
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:48,550
I'm a beast of calamity.

45
00:04:51,230 --> 00:04:53,630
I don't deserve to live in the mortal world.

46
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:55,270
But I really

47
00:04:56,740 --> 00:04:59,260
like the bright lights,

and the prosperity here.

50
00:05:14,180 --> 00:05:15,980
It's just as a beast of calamity,

51
00:05:19,670 --> 00:05:20,830
I have no choice.

52
00:06:22,790 --> 00:06:23,590
Where is Fei?

53
00:06:27,630 --> 00:06:28,430
He's dead.

54
00:06:29,070 --> 00:06:31,730
He killed himself by destroying his inner core.

55
00:07:00,070 --> 00:07:00,870
Good.

56
00:07:02,350 --> 00:07:04,280
It's actually good that he's dead.

57
00:07:05,950 --> 00:07:07,070
Since he died,

58
00:07:10,390 --> 00:07:11,830
I can be free.

59
00:07:17,750 --> 00:07:18,880
It's not good at all.

00:07:19,110 --> 00:07:20,710
Why else would you be crying?

61
00:07:44,230 --> 00:07:45,909
Do you know why you cry?

62
00:07:48,190 --> 00:07:50,590
Because Li Lun hid something in you.

63
00:08:01,630 --> 00:08:02,720
I noticed just now that

64
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:05,250
there's Li Lun's demonic energy in your body.

65
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:08,470
That's why I asked Mr. Zhuo

66
00:08:09,710 --> 00:08:11,150
to use his blood of Bingyi

67
00:08:12,030 --> 00:08:14,690
to cleanse the evil demonic energy in your body.

68
00:08:15,030 --> 00:08:16,270
Mr. Zhuo

69
00:08:16,550 --> 00:08:18,070
is a man of righteousness.

70
00:08:19,190 --> 00:08:20,260
His blood contains more power

71
00:08:20,260 --> 00:08:22,230
to cleanse the evil energy.

72
00:08:55,070 --> 00:08:56,600
Look at this demonic power.

342
00:24:58,510 --> 00:24:59,630
God forbid!

343
00:24:59,630 --> 00:25:01,390
I won't accept that we'll just all die together.

344
00:25:01,390 --> 00:25:02,830
I'll go work on the antidote.

345
00:25:02,830 --> 00:25:03,890
There must be a way.

346
00:25:05,030 --> 00:25:05,830
Jiu!

347
00:25:35,270 --> 00:25:36,430
If you feel sick,

348
00:25:37,150 --> 00:25:38,680
you can lean on my shoulder.

349
00:25:41,150 --> 00:25:42,410
Are you that reliable?

350
00:25:51,710 --> 00:25:53,910
You're indeed more reliable, Mr. Zhuo.

351
00:25:54,550 --> 00:25:55,230
Your shoulders

352
00:25:55,230 --> 00:25:56,270
carry it all.

353
00:25:57,230 --> 00:25:58,030
Thank you.

354
00:25:58,590 --> 00:25:59,790
Are you praising me?

355
00:26:03,230 --> 00:26:04,760
I'm just telling the truth.

356
00:26:05,310 --> 00:26:06,950
If you hadn't been so smart,

357
00:26:08,160 --> 00:26:09,000
pretended to faint,

358
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:10,680
and gone deep into the tiger's den, Mr. Zhuo,

359
00:26:10,680 --> 00:26:11,430
we couldn't have

360
00:26:11,430 --> 00:26:13,360
found the real culprit so quickly.

361
00:26:16,030 --> 00:26:17,270
The real culprit

362
00:26:18,950 --> 00:26:20,150
is Li Lun.

363
00:26:22,590 --> 00:26:23,990
To be precise, it's Li Lun

364
00:26:24,390 --> 00:26:25,510
and Chongwu Camp.

365
00:26:27,390 --> 00:26:29,390
I didn't expect them to join forces.

366
00:26:32,350 --> 00:26:33,620
Li Lun planted

367
00:26:34,150 --> 00:26:35,810
the dark evil aura in Qing Geng

368
00:26:36,190 --> 00:26:37,750
to make her angry

369
00:26:38,200 --> 00:26:39,460
and spread the plague.

370
00:26:40,470 --> 00:26:41,930
And then, he kidnapped Jiu

371
00:26:42,910 --> 00:26:44,510
to lure Mr. Zhuo away.

372
00:26:46,470 --> 00:26:47,730
So that mysterious man

373
00:26:47,870 --> 00:26:49,150
kidnapped me here

374
00:26:50,190 --> 00:26:52,250
to use my Cloud Light Sword to kill you

375
00:26:52,510 --> 00:26:53,910
and take your inner core.

376
00:26:54,630 --> 00:26:56,110
Li Lun is a demon himself.

377
00:26:57,430 --> 00:26:59,230
Why does he want your inner core?

378
00:27:04,470 --> 00:27:06,390
When Qing Geng imprisoned me,

379
00:27:07,550 --> 00:27:09,480
she used Qin Yuan's poison needle.

380
00:27:10,670 --> 00:27:12,130
Qin Yuan's poison needle?

381
00:27:13,710 --> 00:27:14,670
Qin Yuan

382
00:27:16,310 --> 00:27:17,630
is shaped like a bee.

383
00:27:18,070 --> 00:27:19,590
It's as big as a mandarin duck.

384
00:27:19,590 --> 00:27:22,150
When birds and beasts are stung by it, they'll die.

385
00:27:22,150 --> 00:27:24,610
When plants are stung by it, they'll wither.

386
00:27:25,310 --> 00:27:26,870
Chongwu Camp figured out

387
00:27:27,790 --> 00:27:30,030
how to make Qin Yuan's poison needle years ago.

388
00:27:30,030 --> 00:27:31,290
The medicine is ready.

389
00:27:33,880 --> 00:27:35,080
But it's very potent.

390
00:27:35,150 --> 00:27:36,150
I'm not sure.

391
00:27:36,990 --> 00:27:39,520
What if it makes your condition even worse...

392
00:27:48,230 --> 00:27:49,260
Mr. Zhuo.

393
00:27:49,670 --> 00:27:50,790
Let me try it.

394
00:27:51,230 --> 00:27:52,710
I won't die anyway.

395
00:27:53,270 --> 00:27:55,670
There's no room for my condition to worsen.

396
00:28:05,580 --> 00:28:06,550
How does it feel?

397
00:28:08,470 --> 00:28:09,270
Bitter.

398
00:28:12,550 --> 00:28:13,430
I'm asking how you feel,

399
00:28:13,430 --> 00:28:14,510
not how it tastes.

400
00:28:17,750 --> 00:28:18,910
I feel bad.

401
00:28:19,830 --> 00:28:20,590
But I checked

402
00:28:20,590 --> 00:28:23,020
the prescription left on Qing Geng's table.

403
00:28:23,020 --> 00:28:25,590
This is indeed a prescription to cure the plague.

404
00:28:25,590 --> 00:28:26,920
But why doesn't it work?

405
00:28:28,030 --> 00:28:28,950
Qing Geng

406
00:28:28,950 --> 00:28:30,230
once told me

407
00:28:31,350 --> 00:28:33,210
she had studied it for many years,

408
00:28:34,270 --> 00:28:35,390
but it seems

409
00:28:35,830 --> 00:28:37,430
there's still one enhancing ingredient missing

410
00:28:37,430 --> 00:28:39,950
that could combine the power of all herbs.

411
00:28:40,630 --> 00:28:41,960
Enhancing ingredient?

412
00:28:44,230 --> 00:28:46,030
Qing Geng lives on a cypress tree

413
00:28:46,670 --> 00:28:48,670
and feeds on its flowers and fruits.

414
00:28:49,590 --> 00:28:50,520
Avoid plague...

415
00:28:51,950 --> 00:28:53,070
Cypress tree...

416
00:28:54,910 --> 00:28:57,170
I know what the enhancing ingredient is!

417
00:29:03,270 --> 00:29:06,670
It's said that when trees grow over 100 years, they will cultivate spiritual energy.

418
00:29:06,670 --> 00:29:08,030
Qing Geng likes living here,

419
00:29:08,030 --> 00:29:09,830
and she feeds on the flowers and fruits on the tree.

420
00:29:09,830 --> 00:29:12,230
That's why she managed to avoid the plague.

421
00:29:13,150 --> 00:29:14,870
But this tree has withered.

422
00:29:15,030 --> 00:29:16,350
There're no flowers or fruits,

423
00:29:16,350 --> 00:29:17,390
not even leaves.

424
00:29:17,750 --> 00:29:18,750
What should we do?

425
00:29:20,910 --> 00:29:22,310
How about using the bark?

426
00:29:25,710 --> 00:29:26,510
Let's peel it.

427
00:29:29,870 --> 00:29:30,730

00:29:32,190 --> 00:29:33,320

00:29:33,640 --> 00:29:34,480
Alright, your palm hurts.

431
00:29:39,390 --> 00:29:40,190
This won't do.

432
00:29:40,470 --> 00:29:41,710
The bark is too hard.

433
00:29:41,950 --> 00:29:43,070
I have to borrow

434
00:29:43,070 --> 00:29:45,710
the Cloud Light Sword from Mr. Zhuo and try again.

435

513
00:35:11,790 --> 00:35:14,510
Most of those who choose to indulge in their dreams

514
00:35:14,510 --> 00:35:16,070
want to escape.

515
00:35:19,870 --> 00:35:20,710
Perhaps

516
00:35:20,980 --> 00:35:22,780
it's not necessarily escaping,

517
00:35:24,230 --> 00:35:25,430
but choosing.

518
00:35:27,830 --> 00:35:30,230
There are thousands of laws in the world...

519
00:35:30,790 --> 00:35:33,920
But none of them can defeat a single word of willingness.

520
00:35:37,670 --> 00:35:39,070
You saw what I wrote?

521
00:35:43,510 --> 00:35:45,100
Mr. Zhuo saw it.

522
00:35:48,710 --> 00:35:49,430
There are

523
00:35:49,660 --> 00:35:51,390
thousands of laws in the world,

524
00:35:52,350 --> 00:35:53,810
but none of them can defeat

525
00:35:54,070 --> 00:35:55,730
a single word of willingness.

526
00:35:56,880 --> 00:35:58,190
The plague is gone.

527
00:35:58,870 --> 00:35:59,430
Now, Qing Geng

528
00:35:59,110 --> 00:36:01,480
[God Bless Lingxi]

529
00:35:59,710 --> 00:36:01,370
can finally leave this place.

530
00:36:01,790 --> 00:36:03,150
She's been trapped here for over 100 years.

531
00:36:03,150 --> 00:36:03,880
If I were her,

532
00:36:03,910 --> 00:36:05,240
I would have gone crazy.

533
00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:07,450
I don't think she'll leave.

534
00:36:07,750 --> 00:36:08,590
I agree.

535
00:36:14,590 --> 00:36:15,310
Mr. Zhuo

536
00:36:15,420 --> 00:36:16,750
and Ms. Pei.

537
00:36:16,910 --> 00:36:18,230
You used to hate demons the most,

538
00:36:18,230 --> 00:36:20,430
but now you've empathized with demons?

539
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:25,260
Is he always like this?

540
00:36:26,950 --> 00:36:27,430
Yes.

541
00:36:28,430 --> 00:36:29,190
What?

542
00:36:32,830 --> 00:36:33,750
Where's Jiu?

543
00:37:08,230 --> 00:37:09,470
Mother!

544
00:37:09,950 --> 00:37:10,550
Jiu.

545
00:37:10,550 --> 00:37:11,710
Come here.

546
00:37:11,870 --> 00:37:12,550
It's okay.

547
00:37:12,550 --> 00:37:13,680
Your mother is okay.

548
00:37:14,430 --> 00:37:15,070
Jiu!

549
00:37:15,310 --> 00:37:15,880
Jiu!

550
00:37:30,270 --> 00:37:31,060
Jiu!

551
00:37:33,510 --> 00:37:33,990
Jiu!

552
00:37:41,390 --> 00:37:41,860
Jiu.

553
00:37:45,630 --> 00:37:46,430
Brother Zhuo.

554
00:37:48,190 --> 00:37:51,390
I called your name several times, but you didn't respond.

555
00:37:51,830 --> 00:37:52,630
What's wrong?

556
00:37:54,310 --> 00:37:55,630
I thought of my mother.

557
00:38:00,150 --> 00:38:02,030
The demon that killed my mother

558
00:38:03,870 --> 00:38:04,990
was also a tree.

559
00:38:20,270 --> 00:38:21,030
So

560
00:38:22,230 --> 00:38:23,830
you're very scared of trees?

561
00:38:27,670 --> 00:38:29,200
Although trees are silent,

562
00:38:30,190 --> 00:38:31,270
they're calm

563
00:38:31,990 --> 00:38:32,790
and tolerant.

564
00:38:33,230 --> 00:38:35,560
They can always absorb your bad emotions.

565
00:38:35,910 --> 00:38:37,000
When I was a kid,

566
00:38:37,430 --> 00:38:40,760
my father and older brother used to go hunt demons together.

567
00:38:41,030 --> 00:38:42,690
They'd leave me alone at home.

568
00:38:45,950 --> 00:38:47,310
I'd talk to that big tree

569
00:38:47,310 --> 00:38:48,710
in the yard.

570
00:38:47,540 --> 00:38:52,660
♫There're no worries in its eyes♫

571
00:38:50,750 --> 00:38:51,630
Sometimes,

572
00:38:52,150 --> 00:38:53,830
I'd think of it as my older brother,

573
00:38:52,860 --> 00:38:58,110
♫It just wants to sleep on a roof♫

574
00:38:54,550 --> 00:38:55,310
and I'd cry to

575
00:38:55,710 --> 00:38:56,590
and smile at it.

576
00:38:58,840 --> 00:38:59,550
In the end,

577
00:38:59,060 --> 00:39:01,820
♫The river flows east and west♫

578
00:39:00,670 --> 00:39:02,390
I'd fall asleep under the tree.

579
00:39:02,170 --> 00:39:05,050
♫The moonlight shines north and south♫

580
00:39:05,190 --> 00:39:06,150
Yichen.

581
00:39:05,570 --> 00:39:10,760
♫Lonely eyes can't make it through the dawn♫

582
00:39:06,150 --> 00:39:07,210
What are you doing?

583
00:39:09,470 --> 00:39:11,420
I saw you look good wearing a headband,

584
00:39:11,420 --> 00:39:14,480
♫Time is quiet♫

585
00:39:11,750 --> 00:39:13,150
so I wanted to wear it too.

586
00:39:13,630 --> 00:39:14,690
Wearing headbands

587
00:39:15,020 --> 00:39:17,970
♫And noisy at the same time♫

588
00:39:15,780 --> 00:39:16,980
is not for good looks.

589
00:39:17,230 --> 00:39:18,430
Then what is it for?

590
00:39:18,390 --> 00:39:22,760
♫How many are the fallen flowers♫

591
00:39:19,870 --> 00:39:22,130
It's for self-restraint and self-love.

592
00:39:22,910 --> 00:39:24,150
It's to remind you to behave yourself.

593
00:39:23,580 --> 00:39:26,530
♫My heart is burning♫

594
00:39:26,780 --> 00:39:29,800
♫The snowflakes are falling♫

595
00:39:30,250 --> 00:39:35,130
♫A heartbeat of cold and heat♫

596
00:39:36,010 --> 00:39:39,060
♫The world is beautiful♫

597
00:39:39,560 --> 00:39:42,080
♫But troubled♫

598
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:47,430
♫It's going home♫

599
00:39:45,830 --> 00:39:47,960
After hearing what you said, Mr. Zhuo,

600
00:39:49,070 --> 00:39:50,960
I'm not that scared anymore.

601
00:39:49,210 --> 00:39:53,600
♫I'm going home♫

602
00:39:53,990 --> 00:39:55,870
But you're still scared of demons,

603
00:39:55,870 --> 00:39:56,430
right?

604
00:39:57,610 --> 00:40:03,350
♫Has anyone seen a bird with a broken tail?♫

605
00:40:00,550 --> 00:40:02,950
There are so many demons in the Wilderness.

606
00:40:02,950 --> 00:40:04,070
Are you scared?

607
00:40:03,660 --> 00:40:09,500
♫The rain wet its feathers♫

608
00:40:05,590 --> 00:40:07,390
There are demons all over there.

609
00:40:09,670 --> 00:40:11,200
Of course I'm still scared.

610
00:40:11,500 --> 00:40:17,380
♫Its cry has never been heard♫

611
00:40:12,300 --> 00:40:13,350
But

612
00:40:13,350 --> 00:40:14,630
with you

613
00:40:15,190 --> 00:40:17,670
and your powerful Cloud Light Sword here, Mr. Zhuo,

614
00:40:17,670 --> 00:40:23,940
♫Only I know its story♫

615
00:40:17,990 --> 00:40:19,500
I'm not that scared.

616
00:40:21,860 --> 00:40:22,190
Good.

617
00:40:23,030 --> 00:40:24,160
You'll be all right.

618
00:40:53,830 --> 00:40:55,470
Zhao Yuanzhou.

619
00:40:55,990 --> 00:40:58,470
Baize Goddess.

620
00:40:58,950 --> 00:41:03,190
Now that you can freely seal and break the seal,

621
00:41:04,920 --> 00:41:07,920
it seems that you've reached a mutual understanding,

622
00:41:08,870 --> 00:41:10,870
and your minds are in sync.

623
00:41:15,840 --> 00:41:16,950
How nice.

624
00:41:21,510 --> 00:41:23,150
How nice.

625
00:41:31,630 --> 00:41:33,280
How nice.
