[Episode 24]

3
00:02:39,980 --> 00:02:41,760
Wen Zongyu, I'll kill you!

4
00:02:44,829 --> 00:02:45,750
If you kill me,

5
00:02:45,750 --> 00:02:46,750
you'll die too.

6
00:02:48,340 --> 00:02:49,780
What do you mean?

7
00:02:51,570 --> 00:02:52,950
Have you never felt

8
00:02:52,950 --> 00:02:55,310
the burning pain in your chest?

9
00:03:09,930 --> 00:03:11,490
What did you do to me?

10
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:15,580
Whether it's used against a human or a demon,

11
00:03:16,220 --> 00:03:18,680
poison is always the most effective weapon.

12
00:03:19,150 --> 00:03:20,740
If you want to live,

13
00:03:21,329 --> 00:03:23,160
you have to listen to me.

14
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:25,560
I, Li Lun,

15
00:03:27,100 --> 00:03:28,990
never take orders from anyone!

16
00:03:29,750 --> 00:03:30,590
Really?

17
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:02,680
Imperial Physician Liu has checked on him.

18
00:04:03,079 --> 00:04:06,100
He said Zhuo has serious internal injuries

19
00:04:06,230 --> 00:04:07,630
and his life is in danger.

20
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:10,360
He couldn't find the cause

21
00:04:10,830 --> 00:04:13,230
and can only keep him alive with medication

22
00:04:13,350 --> 00:04:15,000
and daily acupuncture.

23
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:18,540
Bingyi has many descendants,

24
00:04:19,190 --> 00:04:22,450
but only a few can be acknowledged by the Cloud Light Sword.

25
00:04:22,529 --> 00:04:24,730
Those who are acknowledged by the Sword

26
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:26,540
will empathize with it.

27
00:04:29,060 --> 00:04:30,350
The Cloud Light Sword

28
00:04:30,930 --> 00:04:32,930
will then become his fate weapon.

29
00:04:34,850 --> 00:04:36,210
Fate weapon?

30
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:40,470
Having a fate weapon means that

31
00:04:41,420 --> 00:04:43,080
as long as the sword is intact,

32
00:04:43,390 --> 00:04:44,650
its owner stays alive;

33
00:04:45,620 --> 00:04:47,080
if the sword is destroyed,

34
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:48,300
its owner dies.

35
00:04:50,850 --> 00:04:51,550
So,

36
00:04:52,230 --> 00:04:54,050
that's the reason

37
00:04:54,710 --> 00:04:56,190
why Zhuo is in a coma.

38
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:02,250
I lost control of my malicious energy…

39
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:09,050
and caused the Cloud Light Sword to crack.

40
00:05:11,350 --> 00:05:13,560
Otherwise, Li Lun alone…

41
00:05:16,590 --> 00:05:19,650
wasn't powerful enough to break the Cloud Light Sword.

42
00:05:22,310 --> 00:05:24,720
Zhuo tried his best to save me,

43
00:05:25,940 --> 00:05:26,780
but I…

44
00:05:29,550 --> 00:05:30,640
hurt him.

45
00:06:05,710 --> 00:06:07,150
If Jiu were here…

46
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:11,420
he'd definitely have a solution.

47
00:06:12,790 --> 00:06:13,810
Yes.

48
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:17,650
Jiu is the most famous young physician in Tiandu.

49
00:06:18,430 --> 00:06:19,910
He cured a lot of people.

50
00:06:23,960 --> 00:06:24,750
Ms. Pei.

51
00:06:25,830 --> 00:06:26,740
Do you think

52
00:06:27,270 --> 00:06:28,240
Jiu will

53
00:06:28,910 --> 00:06:30,830
return to the way he used to be?

54
00:06:36,010 --> 00:06:38,070
I'll definitely take him back

55
00:06:39,670 --> 00:06:41,190
from Li Lun.

56
00:07:00,150 --> 00:07:00,870
Ah.

57
00:07:02,230 --> 00:07:02,870
How about

58
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:05,050
we ask Mr. Lu Wu about it?

59
00:07:05,350 --> 00:07:07,820
There are many rare herbs on Mount Kunlun.

60
00:07:08,190 --> 00:07:08,910
Maybe

61
00:07:08,910 --> 00:07:10,110
Mr. Lu Wu has a way

62
00:07:10,110 --> 00:07:11,530
to cure Mr. Zhuo

63
00:07:11,710 --> 00:07:13,400
or wake Bai Jiu up.

64
00:07:16,860 --> 00:07:18,120
Are you coming with me?

65
00:07:21,660 --> 00:07:22,470
Yes.

66
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:34,060
Li Lun used his inner core

67
00:07:34,060 --> 00:07:35,890
to live in Bai Jiu.

68
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,060
It's much more powerful

69
00:07:37,060 --> 00:07:39,080
than possession by spells.

70
00:07:39,159 --> 00:07:40,820
It's hard to get rid of him.

71
00:07:41,390 --> 00:07:42,220
Is there

72
00:07:42,350 --> 00:07:44,020
no solution at all?

73
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:46,320
There is.

74
00:07:46,940 --> 00:07:49,010
You need the help of Bingyi's descendants.

75
00:07:49,010 --> 00:07:50,030
They can use the Cloud Light Sword

76
00:07:50,030 --> 00:07:53,360
to separate the parasitic primordial spirit from the host.

77
00:07:53,470 --> 00:07:54,530
Cloud Light Sword?

78
00:07:55,590 --> 00:07:56,390
Mr. Zhuo?

79
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:00,690
But I heard

80
00:08:00,990 --> 00:08:03,320
the Cloud Light Sword has been destroyed.

81
00:08:05,090 --> 00:08:05,890
Mr. Lu Wu,

82
00:08:06,870 --> 00:08:07,870
Mr. Zhuo

83
00:08:07,900 --> 00:08:08,990
is in a coma now.

84
00:08:09,650 --> 00:08:10,750
Is there any way

85
00:08:10,750 --> 00:08:11,900
to wake him up?

86
00:08:12,750 --> 00:08:14,170
There is Gui Wood in the Wilderness.

87
00:08:14,170 --> 00:08:15,870
Eating it can restore his energy

88
00:08:15,870 --> 00:08:18,480
and slow down his deterioration.

89
00:08:19,390 --> 00:08:20,230
Gui Wood?

90
00:08:21,950 --> 00:08:22,650
Okay.

91
00:08:23,030 --> 00:08:24,040
I got it.

92
00:08:25,590 --> 00:08:26,380
Ms. Pei.

93
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:29,200
I'll send you back first.

94
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:30,290
I'll go with you.

95
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:31,360
No.

96
00:08:31,750 --> 00:08:32,750
Gui Wood grows

97
00:08:32,750 --> 00:08:34,820
in the crevices of black rocks along the seaside in the Wilderness.

98
00:08:34,820 --> 00:08:36,370
Sea scorpions are everywhere.

99
00:08:36,370 --> 00:08:38,370
There are also red-bellied snakes.

100
00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:39,919
Since it's so dangerous,

101
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:42,320
I can't let you go alone.

102
00:08:42,950 --> 00:08:44,309
You're still injured.

103
00:08:44,669 --> 00:08:45,780
Let me go.

104
00:08:45,809 --> 00:08:47,350
You're not familiar with the Wilderness,

105
00:08:47,350 --> 00:08:48,640
and there are demons everywhere.

106
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:49,520
I'll go.

107
00:08:49,790 --> 00:08:51,190
I'll bring Gui Wood back.

108
00:08:52,340 --> 00:08:53,280
Mr. Zhuo

109
00:08:53,350 --> 00:08:55,280
is the person Jiu admires the most.

110
00:08:55,950 --> 00:08:57,430
I must wake him up.

111
00:08:58,880 --> 00:08:59,790
You should stay

112
00:09:00,110 --> 00:09:01,170
to accompany Xiao.

113
00:09:02,170 --> 00:09:03,970
Goddess needs you more than I do.

114
00:09:15,230 --> 00:09:15,930
Sir.

115
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:31,400
You're back.

116
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:33,400
How do you feel?

117
00:09:34,630 --> 00:09:35,960
Thank you

118
00:09:36,040 --> 00:09:37,260
for your treatment.

119
00:09:38,310 --> 00:09:39,960
I'm right as rain now.

120
00:09:40,220 --> 00:09:41,940
Even better than I was

121
00:09:42,230 --> 00:09:43,230
before I got hurt.

122
00:09:49,160 --> 00:09:50,190
Commander,

123
00:09:50,190 --> 00:09:51,190
according to the spy,

124
00:09:51,190 --> 00:09:54,520
Zhuo Yichen from the Demon Hunting Bureau is sick and dying.

125
00:09:56,860 --> 00:09:59,890
Only Zhuo Yichen can kill Zhao Yuanzhou.

126
00:10:00,430 --> 00:10:02,130
He can't die!

127
00:10:09,950 --> 00:10:11,030
What's wrong?

128
00:10:19,770 --> 00:10:21,440
Wen Zongyu's poison.

129
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:23,870
Poison?

130
00:10:24,940 --> 00:10:26,330
This can wait.

131
00:10:27,310 --> 00:10:30,310
The most important thing now is the Cloud Light Sword.

132
00:10:33,100 --> 00:10:35,040
It can remove my primordial spirit

133
00:10:35,990 --> 00:10:38,000
from Bai Jiu's body.

134
00:10:39,700 --> 00:10:41,780
It's the only thing

135
00:10:42,150 --> 00:10:44,150
I'm afraid of now.

136
00:10:44,950 --> 00:10:46,350
But the Cloud Light Sword

137
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:49,580
has been destroyed, hasn't it?

138
00:10:51,770 --> 00:10:54,030
If we can't repair the Cloud Light Sword,

139
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:57,470
Zhuo will keep deteriorating

140
00:10:58,580 --> 00:11:00,340
until he dies.

141
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:05,280
How can we repair the Cloud Light Sword?

142
00:11:07,670 --> 00:11:10,000
The Cloud Light Sword could be destroyed,

143
00:11:10,850 --> 00:11:12,320
so it can be repaired.

144
00:11:15,950 --> 00:11:17,240
I'll go stop them.

145
00:11:17,870 --> 00:11:18,670
No need.

146
00:11:21,710 --> 00:11:23,410
I have a better plan.

147
00:11:39,270 --> 00:11:39,800
Brother.

148
00:11:40,070 --> 00:11:41,200
You're amazing.

149
00:11:41,370 --> 00:11:42,820
The sword technique just now

150
00:11:42,820 --> 00:11:43,920
looked so cool.

151
00:11:52,330 --> 00:11:53,450
Unfortunately,

152
00:11:54,630 --> 00:11:56,530
the Cloud Light Sword

153
00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:59,260
is only a normal sword in my hand.

154
00:12:01,060 --> 00:12:02,460
I can't wake it up.

155
00:12:04,260 --> 00:12:05,070
Wake it up?

156
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:08,260
This sword can be awakened?

157
00:12:08,930 --> 00:12:10,760
Once awakened, the Cloud Light Sword

158
00:12:10,760 --> 00:12:12,270
can shake the sun and moon

159
00:12:12,290 --> 00:12:13,860
and make the earth tremble.

160
00:12:14,270 --> 00:12:16,890
As long as the one using it is strong enough,

161
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,460
the Cloud Light Sword will awaken on itself.

162
00:12:29,870 --> 00:12:32,930
Brother, you're so powerful but still can't wake it up.

163
00:12:33,640 --> 00:12:35,830
I'm definitely hopeless.

164
00:12:47,010 --> 00:12:49,230
Yichen, have faith in yourself.

165
00:12:50,290 --> 00:12:51,640
After you grow up,

166
00:12:52,330 --> 00:12:54,790
you'll absolutely be more powerful than me.

167
00:12:58,070 --> 00:13:00,330
Then I'll try my best to catch up with you.

168
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:01,280
Okay.

169
00:13:05,670 --> 00:13:06,920
But later,

170
00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:08,900
I'll go out with Father

171
00:13:09,420 --> 00:13:11,060
to catch a great demon.

172
00:13:12,350 --> 00:13:13,520
When I come back,

173
00:13:13,540 --> 00:13:15,660
I'll teach you the technique just now,

174
00:13:15,660 --> 00:13:16,510
okay?

175
00:13:17,790 --> 00:13:18,750
Deal!

176
00:14:31,990 --> 00:14:33,120
Where is my brother?

177
00:14:37,770 --> 00:14:38,960
Say something.

178
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:43,490
Where is my brother?

179
00:15:32,590 --> 00:15:33,380
Brother.

180
00:15:35,390 --> 00:15:38,720
You promised to come back and teach me that sword technique.

181
00:15:40,040 --> 00:15:42,030
We made a deal.

182
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:54,990
♫Someone is singing♫

183
00:15:55,070 --> 00:15:57,270
♫Can you hear it?♫

184
00:15:58,440 --> 00:16:00,970
♫The burning hoarseness♫

185
00:15:59,910 --> 00:16:00,720
Brother,

186
00:16:01,210 --> 00:16:03,580
I swear to be acknowledged by the Cloud Light Sword

187
00:16:01,270 --> 00:16:03,150
♫It sprouts♫

188
00:16:03,190 --> 00:16:05,090
♫And then blooms♫

189
00:16:04,210 --> 00:16:04,850
and learn

190
00:16:04,870 --> 00:16:06,970
the technique you didn't get to teach me.

191
00:16:05,530 --> 00:16:08,650
♫The time of loneliness♫

192
00:16:08,570 --> 00:16:10,480
I'll avenge you and Father.

193
00:16:09,770 --> 00:16:11,680
♫Someone is singing♫

194
00:16:11,750 --> 00:16:13,590
♫I hold the light♫

♫Going the direction where you are♫

♫The bell rings unemotionally♫

197
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:25,620
♫I'm missing you again♫

00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:36,240
Brother.

203
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:38,610
♫Drifting♫

204
00:16:37,470 --> 00:16:39,150

♫Swaying♫

♫Someday I'll return to my old hometown♫

209
00:17:50,710 --> 00:17:56,780
♫Wearing old clothes but with eyes shining bright♫

210
00:17:57,600 --> 00:17:59,720

♫Blocking the pain♫

216
00:18:23,110 --> 00:18:24,210
Cloud Light Sword.

217
00:18:28,030 --> 00:18:29,420
Cloud Light Sword.

218
00:18:30,090 --> 00:18:30,900
Zhuo.

219
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,070
Zhuo.

220
00:18:38,010 --> 00:18:39,170
Cloud Light Sword.

221
00:18:39,830 --> 00:18:40,890
Cloud Light Sword.

222
00:18:41,800 --> 00:18:42,860
Cloud Light Sword.

223
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:46,110
Cloud Light Sword!

224
00:18:46,110 --> 00:18:47,110
Zhuo.

225
00:18:56,270 --> 00:18:57,160
Zhuo.

226
00:18:59,270 --> 00:19:00,400
Zhuo!

227
00:19:00,900 --> 00:19:01,890
Zhuo!

228
00:20:00,280 --> 00:20:01,110
What's this?

229
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:05,950
It's the Bingyi Clan's secret heirloom that has been passed down through generations.

230
00:20:05,950 --> 00:20:07,350
The Fire-Colored Stone.

231
00:20:08,710 --> 00:20:10,920
The kind of stone that Nuwa used

232
00:20:11,980 --> 00:20:13,380
to mend the sky back then?

233
00:20:14,040 --> 00:20:15,180
Yes.

234
00:20:16,470 --> 00:20:17,430
But why is it

235
00:20:17,430 --> 00:20:19,890
in the pool of the Demon Hunting Bureau?

236
00:20:19,910 --> 00:20:22,510
This mansion used to belong to the Zhuo family.

237
00:20:22,670 --> 00:20:25,790
The Zhuo family has kept the Five-Colored Stone for generations.

238
00:20:25,790 --> 00:20:27,580
It can mend the sky

239
00:20:28,150 --> 00:20:29,830
and repair everything.

240
00:20:30,430 --> 00:20:31,710
So I guess

241
00:20:33,700 --> 00:20:37,030
the Five-Colored Stone sensed the broken Cloud Light Sword

242
00:20:37,990 --> 00:20:39,710
and showed up itself.

243
00:20:40,290 --> 00:20:40,910
Great!

244
00:20:40,910 --> 00:20:41,470
But…

245
00:20:43,240 --> 00:20:44,640
I found a way to save Zhuo.

246
00:21:19,240 --> 00:21:20,330
Jiu?

247
00:21:25,420 --> 00:21:26,230
Li Lun.

248
00:21:27,990 --> 00:21:30,250
Do you have to destroy every hope we have?

249
00:21:30,790 --> 00:21:32,700
Can't you spare Zhuo's life?

250
00:21:33,110 --> 00:21:34,330
What about me?

251
00:21:36,740 --> 00:21:39,170
Who will spare my life?

252
00:21:40,760 --> 00:21:43,160
Both Zhuo Yichen and Bai Jiu are my friends.

253
00:21:45,830 --> 00:21:47,290
I must save them.

254
00:21:49,050 --> 00:21:51,580
I used to be your friend too.

255
00:21:51,610 --> 00:21:53,210
I didn't want this to happen.

256
00:21:53,880 --> 00:21:56,000
You brought it on yourself.

257
00:21:58,990 --> 00:22:00,280
You didn't want to,

258
00:22:02,460 --> 00:22:04,520
but you still did it.

259
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:07,180
You started all this.

260
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:09,990
You took over Jiu's body

261
00:22:10,050 --> 00:22:11,680
and live in it.

262
00:22:13,320 --> 00:22:15,340
I won't just sit back and watch.

263
00:22:16,450 --> 00:22:17,240
Oh?

264
00:22:18,440 --> 00:22:19,600
Really?

265
00:22:24,330 --> 00:22:26,460
Then I'll wait for you to come after me.

266
00:23:00,430 --> 00:23:01,970
Fortunately, the Five-Colored Stone

267
00:23:01,970 --> 00:23:03,630
wasn't taken away by Li Lun.

268
00:23:24,020 --> 00:23:25,700
It's Li Lun's vine.

269
00:23:29,560 --> 00:23:33,220
The Stone has been corroded by the demonic energy of Li Lun's vine.

270
00:24:01,950 --> 00:24:02,750
Zhuo!

271
00:24:06,350 --> 00:24:07,270
Zhuo!

272
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:17,590
For the greater good,

273
00:24:17,850 --> 00:24:19,620
I don't mind dying.

274
00:24:19,910 --> 00:24:20,870
Ying Long,

275
00:24:21,300 --> 00:24:22,650
you don't mind dying,

276
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:25,660
but have you ever thought about my feelings?

277
00:24:28,510 --> 00:24:29,310
Bingyi?

278
00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:51,730
Bingyi.

279
00:25:01,270 --> 00:25:02,070
I see.

280
00:25:04,120 --> 00:25:07,310
Li Lun didn't come for the Five-Colored Stone.

281
00:25:07,550 --> 00:25:08,810
Then what does he want?

282
00:25:11,100 --> 00:25:12,640
He wants to turn Zhuo

283
00:25:15,870 --> 00:25:17,000
into a demon.

284
00:25:25,010 --> 00:25:25,870
Gui Wood!

285
00:25:25,900 --> 00:25:27,430
I've brought Gui Wood back.

286
00:25:37,770 --> 00:25:38,630
Mr. Zhuo.

287
00:25:39,410 --> 00:25:40,490
What's going on?

288
00:25:59,830 --> 00:26:01,680
Mr. Zhuo has taken Gui Wood.

289
00:26:02,220 --> 00:26:03,370
Mr. Lu Wu said

290
00:26:03,820 --> 00:26:06,240
Gui Wood can keep Mr. Zhuo alive for now

291
00:26:06,330 --> 00:26:07,530
and buy him some time.

292
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:22,320
Why are you so badly injured?

293
00:26:23,910 --> 00:26:25,230
It's not serious.

294
00:26:27,190 --> 00:26:27,990
Does it hurt?

295
00:26:28,620 --> 00:26:30,250
Just some scratches.

296
00:26:30,810 --> 00:26:31,770
But

297
00:26:32,180 --> 00:26:33,320
they really hurt.

298
00:26:33,350 --> 00:26:34,460
I'll go with you.

299
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:35,360
No, no, no.

300
00:26:35,870 --> 00:26:37,630
Gui Wood grows in the crevices of black rocks

301
00:26:37,630 --> 00:26:38,840
along the seaside in the Wilderness.

302
00:26:38,840 --> 00:26:40,510
Sea scorpions are everywhere.

303
00:26:40,510 --> 00:26:41,620
There are also red-bellied snakes.

304
00:26:41,620 --> 00:26:42,830
Since it's so dangerous

305
00:26:42,830 --> 00:26:44,060
and you're still injured,

306
00:26:44,060 --> 00:26:44,980
let me go.

307
00:26:45,010 --> 00:26:46,510
You're not familiar with the Wilderness.

308
00:26:46,510 --> 00:26:47,540
I'll go.

309
00:26:48,160 --> 00:26:49,820
I'll definitely get Gui Wood.

310
00:27:02,160 --> 00:27:04,210
But as long as it can save Mr. Zhuo,

311
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:05,720
it's all worth it.

312
00:27:09,070 --> 00:27:10,200
It's useless.

313
00:27:11,190 --> 00:27:12,770
You brought Gui Wood back,

314
00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:15,250
but it's just a band-aid fix.

315
00:27:20,290 --> 00:27:22,150
Don't be so cruel, Zhao Yuanzhou.

316
00:27:22,700 --> 00:27:24,830
It was hard for Ying Lei to get Gui Wood.

317
00:27:27,730 --> 00:27:29,940
I just don't want you to be hopeful

318
00:27:30,430 --> 00:27:32,230
and then greatly disappointed.

319
00:27:32,610 --> 00:27:34,260
Prepare for the worst.

320
00:27:34,280 --> 00:27:36,280
What is the worst that could happen?

321
00:27:50,660 --> 00:27:52,520
Breaking the Five-Colored Stone

322
00:27:53,230 --> 00:27:56,140
was worse than breaking the Cloud Light Sword.

323
00:27:57,340 --> 00:27:58,830
The Five-Colored Stone was a sacred object of the Bingyi Clan

324
00:27:58,830 --> 00:28:01,090
that had been passed down from generation to generation.

325
00:28:01,090 --> 00:28:04,020
Besides the ability to repair the Cloud Light Sword,

326
00:28:04,020 --> 00:28:05,970
it was also a very important…

327
00:28:07,670 --> 00:28:08,710
vessel.

328
00:28:09,270 --> 00:28:10,210
Vessel?

329
00:28:11,300 --> 00:28:12,790
To be precise,

330
00:28:14,190 --> 00:28:16,550
it was a vessel for suppression.

331
00:28:20,920 --> 00:28:22,450
You mean that drop of blood?

332
00:28:24,210 --> 00:28:25,660
It was demon blood.

333
00:28:29,350 --> 00:28:30,420
Demon blood?

334
00:28:33,420 --> 00:28:35,890
Back then, Zhuan Xu and Gong Gong started a great war.

335
00:28:35,890 --> 00:28:38,260
Ying Long and Bingyi were involved in it

336
00:28:38,990 --> 00:28:40,340
and fought together.

337
00:28:41,220 --> 00:28:42,760
But legend has it that

338
00:28:43,710 --> 00:28:45,370
Bingyi killed Ying Long

339
00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:47,580
and used his bone

340
00:28:47,750 --> 00:28:49,130
and soul

341
00:28:49,490 --> 00:28:51,640
to forge the Cloud Light Sword.

342
00:28:52,060 --> 00:28:54,260
If they once fought together,

343
00:28:54,550 --> 00:28:55,740
why did

344
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:57,800
Bingyi kill Ying Long?

345
00:28:58,000 --> 00:28:58,990
It's said that

346
00:28:59,020 --> 00:29:01,180
after Gong Gong crashed Mount Buzhou,

347
00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:03,690
the world was thrown into chaos.

348
00:29:04,040 --> 00:29:06,200
But Ying Long kept causing havoc

349
00:29:06,340 --> 00:29:07,620
to destroy the world.

350
00:29:07,660 --> 00:29:10,520
He even attempted to stop Nuwa from mending the sky.

351
00:29:11,080 --> 00:29:13,600
Fortunately, Bingyi came to his senses in time.

352
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:14,930
He realized his mistake

353
00:29:15,750 --> 00:29:17,030
and killed Ying Long.

354
00:29:18,920 --> 00:29:20,300
In that case…

355
00:29:23,430 --> 00:29:25,040
Bingyi was also a demon?

356
00:29:27,550 --> 00:29:28,340
Yes.

357
00:29:29,300 --> 00:29:30,760
Bingyi killed

358
00:29:31,110 --> 00:29:33,460
many evil demons in his time,

359
00:29:33,880 --> 00:29:36,120
so people have always seen him as a god.

360
00:29:36,700 --> 00:29:37,930
But in fact,

361
00:29:39,220 --> 00:29:41,900
he was a great demon born in the Wilderness.

362
00:29:44,800 --> 00:29:45,610
Stop!

363
00:29:51,510 --> 00:29:52,950
You want to catch me?

364
00:29:52,980 --> 00:29:54,580
Demons are evil.

365
00:29:54,710 --> 00:29:56,080
Of course I have to catch you.

366
00:29:56,080 --> 00:29:58,590
But your ancestor was also a demon.

367
00:29:59,380 --> 00:30:01,180
Are you sure you want to catch me?

368
00:30:05,610 --> 00:30:07,640
Why are these stairs so...

369
00:30:12,280 --> 00:30:13,350
Where is Ao Ying?

370
00:30:15,120 --> 00:30:16,390
She escaped.

371
00:30:20,130 --> 00:30:21,080
So...

372
00:30:23,010 --> 00:30:24,120
Zhuo

373
00:30:25,870 --> 00:30:26,870
is also a demon?

374
00:30:28,400 --> 00:30:29,380
Zhuo

375
00:30:29,810 --> 00:30:30,780
is a human.

376
00:30:34,550 --> 00:30:36,270
You're confusing me.

377
00:30:38,470 --> 00:30:40,330
After the battle at Mount Buzhou,

378
00:30:41,470 --> 00:30:43,670
Bingyi wanted to live a reclusive life.

379
00:30:43,970 --> 00:30:46,740
Touched by his heroic deed of killing Ying Long,

380
00:30:47,580 --> 00:30:48,630
Nuwa gifted him

381
00:30:48,630 --> 00:30:50,630
the last Five-Colored Stone

382
00:30:51,330 --> 00:30:52,790
left from mending the sky.

383
00:30:53,340 --> 00:30:55,220
And as Bingyi wished,

384
00:30:55,330 --> 00:30:57,070
she removed his inner core

385
00:30:57,860 --> 00:30:59,530
and purified his demonic energy,

386
00:30:59,530 --> 00:31:01,060
changing him into a mortal.

387
00:31:01,530 --> 00:31:03,950
Since then, Bingyi had lived in the mortal world

388
00:31:03,950 --> 00:31:05,290
in seclusion.

389
00:31:07,630 --> 00:31:09,420
So his descendants

390
00:31:10,560 --> 00:31:12,170
are not demons

391
00:31:13,050 --> 00:31:14,140
but humans.

392
00:31:21,720 --> 00:31:23,950
So the blood in the Five-Colored Stone

393
00:31:24,020 --> 00:31:25,610
was from Bingyi?

394
00:31:25,760 --> 00:31:27,370
Although Nuwa respected

395
00:31:27,390 --> 00:31:29,450
Bingyi's wish to become a mortal,

396
00:31:30,260 --> 00:31:31,590
she couldn't bear to see

397
00:31:31,800 --> 00:31:34,240
Bingyi's rare great power

398
00:31:34,390 --> 00:31:36,340
disappear from the world.

399
00:31:36,490 --> 00:31:38,030
So she sealed a drop of Bingyi's blood

400
00:31:38,030 --> 00:31:40,110
in the Five-Colored Stone

401
00:31:40,130 --> 00:31:41,530
and let it be passed down.

402
00:31:42,630 --> 00:31:43,920
That drop of blood

403
00:31:44,270 --> 00:31:45,760
was the last thing from Bingyi

404
00:31:45,760 --> 00:31:47,310
in this world.

405
00:31:49,830 --> 00:31:51,950
For Bingyi's descendants,

406
00:31:52,920 --> 00:31:55,540
it's sort of a way of undoing that decision.

407
00:31:56,510 --> 00:31:58,230
It allows them

408
00:31:58,510 --> 00:32:00,440
to choose their identities again.

409
00:32:03,730 --> 00:32:04,620
So…

410
00:32:07,320 --> 00:32:09,300
Zhuo will become a demon too,

411
00:32:09,750 --> 00:32:10,710
right?

412
00:32:12,370 --> 00:32:14,120
Once the ink drops into the water,

413
00:32:14,120 --> 00:32:16,050
it's impossible to separate them.

414
00:32:16,520 --> 00:32:18,320
Once he starts becoming a demon,

415
00:32:20,280 --> 00:32:22,010
the process can't be reversed.

416
00:32:24,290 --> 00:32:25,060
No.

417
00:32:25,630 --> 00:32:26,650
No, no, no.

418
00:32:27,110 --> 00:32:29,110
You're probably thinking too much.

419
00:32:29,450 --> 00:32:31,300
Mr. Zhuo is a mortal.

420
00:32:31,320 --> 00:32:32,980
He doesn't have an inner core.

421
00:32:32,990 --> 00:32:34,490
Even if he has demonic power,

422
00:32:34,490 --> 00:32:35,950
it can't change anything.

423
00:32:36,570 --> 00:32:37,900
He can't become a demon.

424
00:32:38,790 --> 00:32:39,910
You're right.

425
00:32:40,970 --> 00:32:42,770
That's the worst-case scenario

426
00:32:43,090 --> 00:32:44,410
I mentioned.

427
00:32:45,810 --> 00:32:47,810
A mortal without an inner core

428
00:32:49,510 --> 00:32:51,740
can't absorb and carry demonic power.

429
00:32:52,230 --> 00:32:54,500
Once Bingyi's immense demonic power awakens,

430
00:32:54,500 --> 00:32:56,380
it'll rage through

431
00:32:56,410 --> 00:32:57,980
Zhuo's body

432
00:32:58,850 --> 00:33:00,490
until his veins burst.

433
00:33:01,230 --> 00:33:02,470
All his organs

434
00:33:03,170 --> 00:33:04,790
will be torn apart.

435
00:33:05,420 --> 00:33:08,080
When the demon blood completely takes control,

436
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:11,630
he'll die.

437
00:33:18,330 --> 00:33:20,070
Is there no way to save him?

438
00:33:21,330 --> 00:33:22,610
As far as I know,

439
00:33:24,410 --> 00:33:25,390
no.

440
00:33:28,220 --> 00:33:29,180
Unless...

441
00:33:29,210 --> 00:33:30,330
What?

442
00:33:32,210 --> 00:33:35,140
Unless we go to the forbidden area of the Bingyi Clan.

443
00:33:35,670 --> 00:33:36,780
There,

444
00:33:37,570 --> 00:33:40,240
we might find a way to save Zhuo.

445
00:33:47,120 --> 00:33:47,990
Ms. Pei,

446
00:33:48,310 --> 00:33:50,970
are we really going to the sacred site of the Bingyi Clan?

447
00:33:50,970 --> 00:33:52,430
The old Mountain Gods said

448
00:33:52,650 --> 00:33:53,940
that's a scary place.

449
00:33:55,310 --> 00:33:56,100
Stop there!

450
00:34:01,500 --> 00:34:02,400
It's you.

451
00:34:03,550 --> 00:34:05,220
I'm here to check on

452
00:34:05,380 --> 00:34:07,350
Commander Zhuo's injuries.

453
00:34:08,930 --> 00:34:11,460
You're like a weasel pretending to be caring.

454
00:34:14,730 --> 00:34:16,880
Or a tiger pretending to be softhearted.

455
00:34:16,880 --> 00:34:18,280
You're like a cockroach…

456
00:34:20,310 --> 00:34:22,310
Everyone knows you're up to no good.

457
00:34:22,670 --> 00:34:24,219
I do care for him.

458
00:34:26,080 --> 00:34:27,940
I'm worried that Mr. Zhuo may die.

459
00:34:28,350 --> 00:34:30,929
Your meridians were crushed by Zhao Yuanzhou's violent demonic power,

460
00:34:30,929 --> 00:34:31,929
but you survived.

461
00:34:32,190 --> 00:34:34,340
How could anything happen to Mr. Zhuo?

462
00:34:34,590 --> 00:34:36,389
Born into a rich family, Mr. Zhuo

463
00:34:36,719 --> 00:34:38,600
is fragile.

464
00:34:38,830 --> 00:34:40,870
You must take good care of him.

465
00:34:43,310 --> 00:34:44,440
Did I hear him right?

466
00:34:45,620 --> 00:34:46,840
He asked us

467
00:34:47,310 --> 00:34:49,230
to take good care of Mr. Zhuo?

468
00:34:49,750 --> 00:34:50,360
Yes.

469
00:34:53,350 --> 00:34:54,580
Could it be that…

470
00:34:55,190 --> 00:34:55,909
he suddenly cares?

471
00:34:55,909 --> 00:34:57,370
it's Wen Zongyu's scheme?

472
00:35:00,650 --> 00:35:01,440
Ms. Pei.

473
00:35:01,659 --> 00:35:02,590
Shall I stop him?

474
00:35:03,630 --> 00:35:04,230
Yes.

475
00:35:21,750 --> 00:35:22,950
Are you hiding there?

476
00:35:36,100 --> 00:35:37,310
What exactly is

477
00:35:38,510 --> 00:35:40,440
the Bingyi Clan's forbidden area?

478
00:35:42,670 --> 00:35:44,800
It's the Bingyi Clan's burial ground.

479
00:35:46,260 --> 00:35:48,280
All their past stories and secrets

480
00:35:48,310 --> 00:35:50,110
are buried there.

481
00:35:51,390 --> 00:35:52,300
At that place,

482
00:35:53,200 --> 00:35:55,620
we might find a way to save Zhuo.

483
00:35:55,830 --> 00:35:58,060
Do you know where that area is?

484
00:35:58,790 --> 00:35:59,590
Of course.

485
00:36:01,950 --> 00:36:03,130
In the Wilderness…

486
00:36:05,210 --> 00:36:07,210
that place is famous.

487
00:36:08,670 --> 00:36:09,910
Then let's go there.

488

As the old saying goes,

502
00:37:50,340 --> 00:37:51,690
aunts and nephews

503
00:37:51,710 --> 00:37:52,980
are so close

504
00:37:53,180 --> 00:37:54,370
that even if the bones break,

505
00:37:54,370 --> 00:37:55,770
the connection remains.

506
00:37:55,860 --> 00:37:57,870
I didn't expect you

507
00:37:58,450 --> 00:38:00,510
to care so much about Zhuo as his aunt.

508
00:38:05,950 --> 00:38:07,270
I always

509
00:38:07,270 --> 00:38:09,510
tease him by saying I'm his aunt,

510
00:38:11,040 --> 00:38:12,590
but actually,

511
00:38:13,260 --> 00:38:14,700
since I was young,

512
00:38:16,500 --> 00:38:18,600
he has been taking care of me.

513
00:38:20,080 --> 00:38:21,710
Once,

514
00:38:21,970 --> 00:38:23,600
I caught a cold.

515
00:38:25,250 --> 00:38:28,180
My father happened to be away for official business.

516
00:38:28,200 --> 00:38:29,680
So Zhuo

517
00:38:30,600 --> 00:38:32,080
got a doctor for me,

518
00:38:33,480 --> 00:38:34,740
prepared decoctions,

519
00:38:35,340 --> 00:38:36,940
and took care of me all night.

520
00:38:38,360 --> 00:38:39,870
After I recovered,

521
00:38:41,010 --> 00:38:42,930
he fell ill.

522
00:38:43,340 --> 00:38:44,580
I felt very guilty.

523
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:48,210
But he actually told me that

524
00:38:49,440 --> 00:38:51,100
he was happy

525
00:38:52,160 --> 00:38:54,700
because after I gave him my cold,

526
00:38:55,030 --> 00:38:56,310
I could recover.

527
00:38:59,670 --> 00:39:01,110
He was such a fool,

528
00:39:01,880 --> 00:39:02,890
wasn't he?

529
00:39:04,840 --> 00:39:06,780
The 15-year-old Mr. Zhuo

530
00:39:09,150 --> 00:39:10,560
was still so childish.

531
00:39:11,420 --> 00:39:12,710
He was childish,

532
00:39:15,190 --> 00:39:16,730
but he was also sensible

533
00:39:17,560 --> 00:39:18,830
and strong.

534
00:39:20,590 --> 00:39:23,520
In the year after his father and brother passed away,

535
00:39:24,080 --> 00:39:25,910
he was depressed.

536
00:39:27,240 --> 00:39:28,640
But soon,

537
00:39:29,150 --> 00:39:31,030
he pulled himself together

538
00:39:31,500 --> 00:39:33,280
and became strong, brave,

539
00:39:33,430 --> 00:39:34,710
and independent.

540
00:39:35,430 --> 00:39:36,790
He became the talented swordsman

541
00:39:36,790 --> 00:39:39,310
whom everyone in Tiandu looked up to.

542
00:39:40,120 --> 00:39:41,110
Sometimes,

543
00:39:43,200 --> 00:39:44,880
people become independent

544
00:39:47,380 --> 00:39:49,410
not because they're sensible,

545
00:39:51,860 --> 00:39:53,060
but because…

546
00:39:57,510 --> 00:39:58,510
Because what?

547
00:40:02,970 --> 00:40:04,750
Because they're lonely.

548
00:40:13,500 --> 00:40:14,550
Are you scared?

549
00:40:18,690 --> 00:40:19,910
Don't be scared.

550
00:40:21,220 --> 00:40:22,780
Zhuo

551
00:40:23,750 --> 00:40:25,230
is no longer

552
00:40:25,770 --> 00:40:26,990
the boy he used to be.

553
00:40:29,420 --> 00:40:30,650
He has us.

554
00:40:33,610 --> 00:40:34,220
Yes.

555
00:40:36,700 --> 00:40:38,050
He's not lonely.

556
00:40:36,980 --> 00:40:43,850
♫There are countless rules in this world♫

557
00:40:38,100 --> 00:40:39,600
You're not the only one

558
00:40:39,860 --> 00:40:41,390
in the Demon Hunting Squad.

559
00:40:41,410 --> 00:40:43,010
You don't have to take everything on your shoulders.

560
00:40:43,010 --> 00:40:44,300
Let me do it.

561
00:40:44,390 --> 00:40:48,410
♫But none can compare to "I am willing"♫

562
00:40:45,960 --> 00:40:48,960
I'll go to the Wilderness to find Gui Wood for Mr. Zhuo.

563
00:40:49,220 --> 00:40:58,630
♫If heaven decides my destiny, I'll be its enemy♫

564
00:40:53,240 --> 00:40:54,390
Mr. Zhuo.

565
00:40:54,830 --> 00:40:57,290
I'll definitely bring Gui Wood back for you.

566
00:41:01,100 --> 00:41:07,890
♫I sing under the moon and swing my sword to the wind♫

567
00:41:08,370 --> 00:41:12,420
♫Drunk on the autumn breeze beneath the bright moon♫

568
00:41:13,080 --> 00:41:22,260
♫Penning small verses of a grand legend♫

569
00:41:43,110 --> 00:41:44,170
It's getting cold.

570
00:41:46,040 --> 00:41:48,040
Why are you sitting in the wind here?

571
00:41:53,970 --> 00:41:55,160
Sister,

572
00:41:56,520 --> 00:41:58,440
are you worried about Mr. Zhuo

573
00:42:00,590 --> 00:42:02,120
and Bai Jiu?

574
00:42:05,040 --> 00:42:06,930
Jiu is the youngest among us

575
00:42:08,310 --> 00:42:10,040
and doesn't know martial arts.

576
00:42:10,750 --> 00:42:12,110
He's very timid.

577
00:42:13,330 --> 00:42:14,910
When there was danger,

578
00:42:15,880 --> 00:42:18,380
he always hid behind me and Zhuo.

579
00:42:20,460 --> 00:42:22,890
I wonder how he is now.

580
00:42:25,160 --> 00:42:26,580
Is he scared?

581
00:42:30,400 --> 00:42:31,900
You treat Bai Jiu so well…

582
00:42:35,230 --> 00:42:36,870
like he's your own brother.

583
00:42:40,250 --> 00:42:42,200
I used to be weak and sick.

584
00:42:43,710 --> 00:42:45,510
You got used to taking care of me.

585
00:42:49,610 --> 00:42:51,250
Now that I'm a puppet,

586
00:42:53,310 --> 00:42:54,430
I don't feel pain

587
00:42:55,900 --> 00:42:57,150
or get hurt.

588
00:42:59,920 --> 00:43:01,770
I can protect you now.

589
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:05,630
But Bai Jiu is different.

590
00:43:07,520 --> 00:43:09,160
He really needs you.

591
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:12,210
Is that why

592
00:43:13,600 --> 00:43:15,190
you care and worry

593
00:43:16,610 --> 00:43:17,820
so much about him?

594
00:43:25,720 --> 00:43:26,520
Yes.

595
00:43:33,270 --> 00:43:34,750
But Heng

596
00:43:34,770 --> 00:43:35,810
is Heng.

597
00:43:37,230 --> 00:43:38,900
You're never anyone else,

598
00:43:40,380 --> 00:43:42,360
and you'll never be.

599
00:43:45,860 --> 00:43:47,510
No one can replace you.

600
00:43:52,280 --> 00:43:55,010
With you fighting alongside me,

601
00:43:56,950 --> 00:43:59,260
I can protect others better.

602
00:44:08,630 --> 00:44:09,750
I'm happy

603
00:44:12,050 --> 00:44:14,210
that I'm no longer your burden.

604
00:44:14,460 --> 00:44:16,900
I've become your armor.

605
00:44:18,040 --> 00:44:18,840
But...

606
00:44:23,940 --> 00:44:25,090
But what?

607
00:44:31,930 --> 00:44:32,790
Nothing.

608
00:45:03,550 --> 00:45:04,190
Father.

609
00:45:04,880 --> 00:45:05,670
Cloud Light Sword.

610
00:45:05,670 --> 00:45:06,430
Zhuo.

611
00:45:06,800 --> 00:45:07,400
Cloud…

612
00:45:08,470 --> 00:45:09,490
Cloud Light Sword.

613
00:45:09,490 --> 00:45:10,410
Zhuo.

614
00:45:27,330 --> 00:45:28,460
Zhuo.

615
00:45:29,850 --> 00:45:31,110
Where are you going?

616
00:45:31,280 --> 00:45:32,110
Zhuo!
