1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,280
Draw the face first.

2
00:00:11,640 --> 00:00:14,920
Excited

3
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:26,760
Waiting for the moment to come.

4
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:05,000
I'm sorry, but I'm not sure if I can get the money back.

5
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:10,000
I'm sorry, but I'm not sure if I can get the money back.

6
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:15,000
I'm sorry, but I'm not sure if I can get the money back.

7
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:20,000
I'm sorry, but I'm not sure if I can get the money back.

8
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:25,000
I'm sorry, but I'm not sure if I can get the money back.

9
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:30,000
I'm sorry, but I'm not sure if I can get the money back.

10
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:35,000
I'm sorry, but I'm not sure if I can get the money back.

11
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:40,000
I'm sorry, but I'm not sure if I can get the money back.

12
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,500
幾乎艺的五文貴妾

13
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:22,000
場面

14
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,760
A magical secret.

15
00:02:33,460 --> 00:02:34,620
I'm going out now.

16
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
I'm going to fall asleep when you wait.

17
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
You know I'm coming.

18
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,000
I know you can't let go.

19
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,000
I can't let go of your life.

20
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
You have countless lives to spare.

21
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,000
You can't die.

22
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,000
So you will come.

23
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Because you want to know the real use of the light sword.

24
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,000
I can tell you.

25
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
But you have conditions.

26
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Yes.

27
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,000
What do you want?

28
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
I want to hear your words.

29
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:32,000
I will never return the important things.

30
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
What do you want me to do?

31
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,000
I want you to kill me.

32
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:48,000
I will teach you the real use of the light sword.

33
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Then you kill me.

34
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Do you want to die?

35
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Yes.

36
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
And I have to die in your hands.

37
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
I don't understand.

38
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,000
If you want to die,

39
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
there are ten thousand ways.

40
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Why must I kill you?

41
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
People call me the evil.

42
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Why do you think so?

43
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Because you are evil.

44
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
You are cruel.

45
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Lord Zhuo, don't believe those rumors.

46
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
What?

47
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Are you a good person?

48
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,000
No.

49
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:44,000
I'm more fierce and evil than the legend.

50
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
I'm more evil.

51
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Not only do I take the power of the heaven and earth,

52
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
but also the glory of the city.

53
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Do you know the power?

54
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Of course I know.

55
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,000
I will destroy the earth.

56
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
I will kill time and the world.

57
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
I will kill the world.

58
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
So I'm dead.

59
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:13,000
The world will have a new glory.

60
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:17,000
It will be the power that I will never face.

61
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:23,000
And the new glory is kind and evil.

62
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
It's true and evil.

63
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
You can't forgive it.

64
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Your glory sword can destroy everything.

65
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,000
If you die,

66
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:43,000
you can completely destroy the glory.

67
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:48,000
It can't be the power of the heaven and earth.

68
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
If you are dead,

69
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
you can completely destroy the world.

70
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
It's true.

71
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
You can't forgive it.

72
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,000
You can't forgive it.

73
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,000
I will kill the world.

74
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,000
You can't forgive it.

75
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
You can't forgive it.

76
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,000
You can't forgive it.

77
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
The soul is broken.

78
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Very good.

79
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
What's going on?

80
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
What happened?

81
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
I don't know what's going on.

82
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
He was fine when the commander came.

83
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
The commander came?

84
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,000
He just left.

85
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Open the door.

86
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Yes.

87
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
Mr. Fan Yin.

88
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:56,000
We need to choose a golden cloth that can be used to make a full-scale battle.

89
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:59,000
It can be used to kill people quickly.

90
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
This is the list of the candidates you heard.

91
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Each of them has a deep knowledge.

92
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
There are 28 people in total.

93
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
Five people are not enough.

94
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
I don't need you.

95
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
I have prepared five gold coins.

96
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:14,000
The two of them have already handed it to him.

97
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:22,000
These two are not on the list you have chosen.

98
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
The first one is the golden cloth.

99
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
The second one is the silver cloth.

100
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
The third one is the silver cloth.

101
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
The fourth one is the silver cloth.

102
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
The fourth one is the silver cloth.

103
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
The fifth one is the silver cloth.

104
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
The fifth one is the silver cloth.

105
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
The fifth one is the silver cloth.

106
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
The fifth one is the silver cloth.

107
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
The fifth one is the silver cloth.

108
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
The fifth one is the silver cloth.

109
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
The fifth one is the silver cloth.

110
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
The fifth one is the silver cloth.

111
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
The fifth one is the silver cloth.

112
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
The fifth one is the silver cloth.

113
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
The fifth one is the silver cloth.

114
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
Get up.

115
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
Don't pretend.

116
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:26,000
I didn't expect Miss Wen Xiao to care so much about me.

117
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:29,000
Let alone the feeling...

118
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:34,000
I already got up. Are you still awake?

119
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,800
In case I kill you first,

120
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:41,600
I can use the spirit umbrella to heal your waist.

121
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:44,800
Otherwise, I'm afraid you'll hurt me.

122
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:47,880
You've been hurting me?

123
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:50,520
The demon can't be killed.

124
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:51,920
Why are you here?

125
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:54,680
I'm here to give you a gift.

126
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:00,880
It seems that Lord Fan Ying has accepted my proposal.

127
00:09:01,880 --> 00:09:03,720
Lord Fan Ying is not a wise man.

128
00:09:03,880 --> 00:09:05,360
I'm very polite.

129
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:06,560
Tell me.

130
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:08,080
What do you want?

131
00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:10,120
I want an answer.

132
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:14,320
What does Xiao Zhuo want you to do?

133
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:25,080
Why are you so concerned about him?

134
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:28,600
A man with no use.

135
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:34,000
Xiao Zhuo is not a man with no use.

136
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:35,760
Xiao Zhuo?

137
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:37,320
Xiao Zhuo?

138
00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:47,680
What's going on?

139
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:49,240
You can't tell me...

140
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:52,920
This is my agreement with the Lord of the Ruos.

141
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:54,480
It's a secret.

142
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:56,960
How can I tell others?

143
00:09:57,440 --> 00:09:58,320
Others?

144
00:09:59,080 --> 00:10:00,320
Lord Zhao Yunzhou

145
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:03,280
is only known to ask me to cooperate.

146
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:06,640
Now I'm calling others.

147
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:08,720
Yes.

148
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:12,760
You're unhappy with me.

149
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:14,360
I'm not happy.

150
00:10:15,560 --> 00:10:18,400
Women in the world are heartless.

151
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:20,960
You really study women in the world.

152
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:22,440
Let's do it one by one.

153
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:25,400
You also take a pen and a notebook every day

154
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:27,200
to study the demon in our world.

155
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:29,920
You and I are half-percent.

156
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:33,440
How many things have you asked me?

157
00:10:36,040 --> 00:10:38,000
If it wasn't for my request,

158
00:10:38,520 --> 00:10:40,920
I'm afraid I'd be in trouble with you.

159
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:42,800
I'd be in trouble with Feng Chui.

160
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:45,440
I can't make it to the end of my life.

161
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
When did I say I'd join you?

162
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:48,680
Look.

163
00:10:49,160 --> 00:10:49,840
Look.

164
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:52,360
You're right.

165
00:10:52,760 --> 00:10:55,440
Women love to talk.

166
00:10:56,440 --> 00:10:58,800
I already enquired about it before I went out.

167
00:10:59,520 --> 00:11:02,280
Miss Wenxia hasics.

168
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:04,560
She often goes crazy

169
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:06,680
around the bed with the evil monster.

170
00:11:07,240 --> 00:11:09,720
She's in a bad mood

171
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:11,600
and is otherwiseably evil.

172
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:12,920
Right?

173
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:15,560
Yet you make an exception

174
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:17,920
which I look forward to.

175
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:20,960
I'm still переходable!

176
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:24,560
That's so cool.

177
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:26,840
I know a lot.

178
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:31,400
I also know that you are Bai Ze's disciple.

179
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,400
What's so funny?

180
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,560
All the demons of the Great Wall

181
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,560
know that I'm Bai Ze's daughter.

182
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:46,440
In the Great Wall,

183
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:49,200
if you're going to be famous,

184
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:54,800
I'm not as good as you are.

185
00:11:56,400 --> 00:11:57,880
A godess without Bai Ze's order

186
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,880
and a godess with Bai Ze's power,

187
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:02,120
you are indeed very famous.

188
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:06,600
A joke that everyone knows.

189
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:12,040
If your master Zhao Wan'er

190
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:14,360
sees your appearance today,

191
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:17,920
will he be disappointed?

192
00:12:26,280 --> 00:12:27,520
My point!

193
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:34,740
쓁.

194
00:12:35,660 --> 00:12:37,040
Approach it.

195
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,560
My favorite approach.

196
00:12:52,760 --> 00:12:54,240
I hate to leave things.

197
00:12:55,440 --> 00:13:00,440
You've asked this question once.

198
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:05,440
Then come closer and confirm it.

199
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:20,440
Do you know why your body is so weak?

200
00:13:20,440 --> 00:13:23,440
Because Bai Ze Ling is missing.

201
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:26,440
I know.

202
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:28,440
You don't need to say anything.

203
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:33,440
Then you know that if you can't find her again,

204
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:36,440
you will soon die?

205
00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:46,440
Looks like your master didn't tell you.

206
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:50,440
Now, you have all the power.

207
00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:52,440
Unless you find Bai Ze Ling,

208
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:55,440
you will soon be weak.

209
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:58,440
I can help you.

210
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:02,440
I came here from the Great Wall

211
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:06,440
to help you find Bai Ze Ling.

212
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:09,440
In this situation,

213
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:11,440
we work together.

214
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:13,440
We need each other.

215
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:15,440
Isn't that good?

216
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:18,440
I really need Bai Ze Ling.

217
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:21,440
What about you?

218
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:24,440
What do you want?

219
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:26,440
I want Bai Ze Ling too.

220
00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:28,440
Why do you want Bai Ze Ling?

221
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:31,440
Because the Goddess is not back.

222
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:34,440
If we drag her down,

223
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:37,440
the Great Wall will be destroyed.

224
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:39,440
After Zhao Er is dead,

225
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:41,440
the Great Wall is missing.

226
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:43,440
The guards are not here.

227
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:45,440
The monster that is in the castle

228
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:47,440
opened the door of Kunlun

229
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:50,440
and came to the mortal world.

230
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:55,440
Bai Ze is not back.

231
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:58,440
The Great Wall is destroyed.

232
00:14:58,440 --> 00:15:00,440
Zhu Yan,

233
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:03,440
I have been missing for a long time.

234
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:06,440
I am not in the faraway land of Kunlun.

235
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:09,440
I will go back to ask for her.

236
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:12,440
To find the Goddess and find Bai Ze Ling,

237
00:15:12,440 --> 00:15:16,440
is the last chance for you to be 10 years old.

238
00:15:21,880 --> 00:15:23,940
Gan No אחar

239
00:15:35,940 --> 00:15:37,940
Heaven's Great Wall observing been destroyed.

240
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:48,440
The Water Monsters of the hitting

241
00:15:48,440 --> 00:15:53,440
I will bring back the important things that were left in the world.

242
00:15:54,440 --> 00:15:58,440
I will return the peace to the world.

243
00:16:04,440 --> 00:16:06,440
I said so much.

244
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:09,440
What do you look like?

245
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:11,440
You look so fake.

246
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:13,440
Take it.

247
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:15,440
Okay.

248
00:16:16,440 --> 00:16:21,440
People know that there is a lot of trouble in the world.

249
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:24,440
Eight years ago, you were a drug dealer.

250
00:16:24,440 --> 00:16:26,440
There were countless people who killed people.

251
00:16:26,440 --> 00:16:29,440
Among them, there was a brother named Xiao Zhuo.

252
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:35,440
You were so energetic and evil.

253
00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:41,440
You don't look like a person who is responsible and righteous.

254
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:43,440
You are a demon.

255
00:16:44,440 --> 00:16:46,440
Really?

256
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:49,440
Do people think so?

257
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:54,440
Even you think so?

258
00:16:57,440 --> 00:16:58,440
Yes.

259
00:16:58,440 --> 00:17:00,440
Then I can only go back to Chongmu Camp and do it.

260
00:17:14,440 --> 00:17:15,440
You can't threaten me.

261
00:17:15,440 --> 00:17:17,440
You can't threaten me either.

262
00:17:19,440 --> 00:17:21,440
Let's just keep it this way.

263
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:23,440
Yi Zijun.

264
00:17:23,440 --> 00:17:25,440
Okay.

265
00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:32,440
I can't reach the two-time mark in one pit.

266
00:17:32,440 --> 00:17:34,440
Do you think I will let you get close to me?

267
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:36,440
Then what about this?

268
00:17:36,440 --> 00:17:38,440
No matter what you hide,

269
00:17:38,440 --> 00:17:42,440
the purpose of taking you to the Jiao Temple is to find me.

270
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:46,440
If I die, your plan will be over.

271
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:48,440
Yes.

272
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:57,440
I want to let someone die.

273
00:17:58,440 --> 00:18:00,440
No one can survive.

274
00:18:02,440 --> 00:18:06,440
Anyway, I want to let him live.

275
00:18:08,440 --> 00:18:11,440
He can't die in front of me.

276
00:18:14,440 --> 00:18:16,440
Live well.

277
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:19,440
At least,

278
00:18:20,440 --> 00:18:23,440
your master hopes you can live well.

279
00:18:44,440 --> 00:18:45,440
Master Fan,

280
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:47,440
I have three more cards.

281
00:18:54,440 --> 00:18:56,440
I will send the official document

282
00:18:56,440 --> 00:18:59,440
to the final two people in the same pit.

283
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:02,440
I will announce the Jiao Temple reconstruction.

284
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:09,440
Black Death Mirror.

285
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:15,440
Black Death Mirror.

286
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:20,440
Black Death Mirror.

287
00:19:24,440 --> 00:19:26,440
White Death Mirror.

288
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:33,440
White Death Mirror.

289
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:35,440
Where is this opening?

290
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:38,440
A former elite team directly departs

291
00:19:38,440 --> 00:19:40,440
to replace the Chong Wuying.

292
00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:42,440
The one who stole the case.

293
00:19:50,440 --> 00:19:52,440
I brought the jade pendant from Qingfeng House.

294
00:19:52,440 --> 00:19:54,440
Xiao Zhuang, you like it the most.

295
00:20:04,440 --> 00:20:06,440
You must join the Jiao Siqin team.

296
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:08,440
Is that bad?

297
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:10,440
Of course not.

298
00:20:10,440 --> 00:20:13,440
It's too dangerous to talk about the chest.

299
00:20:14,440 --> 00:20:16,440
I'm afraid of what if Xiao Zhuang is here.

300
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:18,440
You will protect me.

301
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:23,440
I will definitely protect you.

302
00:20:24,440 --> 00:20:25,440
But...

303
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:30,440
For years, we have been looking for the police.

304
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:33,440
We have been working hard for a long time.

305
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:34,440
We have no clue.

306
00:20:34,440 --> 00:20:37,440
Now Zhu Yan is here to help.

307
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:39,440
How good is the chance?

308
00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:41,440
You believe him.

309
00:20:42,440 --> 00:20:45,440
I don't believe him.

310
00:20:50,440 --> 00:20:51,440
But I always think...

311
00:20:52,440 --> 00:20:54,440
He is like my master's friend.

312
00:20:57,440 --> 00:20:59,440
Can you help me push it?

313
00:21:00,440 --> 00:21:01,440
No.

314
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:02,440
You are already old.

315
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:07,440
Can't you wait for the money when you grow up?

316
00:21:08,440 --> 00:21:10,440
My master said he would take care of me.

317
00:21:34,440 --> 00:21:35,440
If it's him,

318
00:21:36,440 --> 00:21:38,440
he might know Bai Ze Ling's whereabouts.

319
00:21:38,440 --> 00:21:39,440
It's impossible.

320
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:42,440
Zhu Yan killed so many people in the Jiao Siqin team.

321
00:21:42,440 --> 00:21:44,440
Your master is Bai Ze's god daughter.

322
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:48,440
How could he be with Zhu Yan?

323
00:21:50,440 --> 00:21:51,440
You are so old.

324
00:21:52,440 --> 00:21:54,440
Don't keep the old and old old Qihengqiu's expression.

325
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:57,440
I'm 24 next month.

326
00:21:57,440 --> 00:21:58,440
You are 42 years old.

327
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:00,440
I'm not sure.

328
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:02,440
I'm not sure.

329
00:22:02,440 --> 00:22:03,440
You are 24 years old.

330
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:04,440
You are 42 years old.

331
00:22:04,440 --> 00:22:05,440
I'm your aunt.

332
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:06,440
I...

333
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:22,440
I know

334
00:22:24,440 --> 00:22:26,440
you can't get over the pain.

335
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:29,440
You have to fight with your brother

336
00:22:30,440 --> 00:22:32,440
to fight together.

337
00:22:32,440 --> 00:22:33,440
To fight each other.

338
00:22:34,440 --> 00:22:36,440
I'm going to fight with my brother.

339
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:41,440
Then you still agree to keep the Jiao Siqin team, right?

340
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:45,440
This is your ancestral house.

341
00:22:46,440 --> 00:22:47,440
You grew up here.

342
00:22:48,440 --> 00:22:50,440
You are willing to donate it

343
00:22:50,440 --> 00:22:52,440
to rebuild the Jiao Siqin team.

344
00:22:52,440 --> 00:22:53,440
Can't you...

345
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:54,440
After my brother died,

346
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:57,440
this is just a house with air.

347
00:23:00,440 --> 00:23:01,440
It's not a house.

348
00:23:02,440 --> 00:23:04,440
I'm alone here.

349
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:07,440
There are many lights.

350
00:23:10,440 --> 00:23:11,440
Eight years ago,

351
00:23:12,440 --> 00:23:14,440
I had no home.

352
00:23:18,440 --> 00:23:20,440
Now the Jiao Siqin team is here.

353
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:22,440
There are more people.

354
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:24,440
It's better to fight.

355
00:23:26,440 --> 00:23:28,440
The Jiao Siqin team

356
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:30,440
is a big family.

357
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:33,440
For Cha'an and Bai Ze Ling,

358
00:23:34,440 --> 00:23:36,440
they are together with the enemy.

359
00:23:36,440 --> 00:23:37,440
They will understand you.

360
00:23:38,440 --> 00:23:39,440
They won't blame you.

361
00:23:42,440 --> 00:23:43,440
Actually, I agree.

362
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:45,440
The Jiao Siqin team is because

363
00:23:48,440 --> 00:23:49,440
What?

364
00:23:54,440 --> 00:23:55,440
Mr. Zhuang.

365
00:23:56,440 --> 00:23:57,440
Xiao Zhuo.

366
00:23:57,440 --> 00:23:59,440
Do you know that your ancestral weapons

367
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:01,440
have been killed by the evil Yilong?

368
00:24:02,440 --> 00:24:03,440
I know.

369
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:05,440
Yilong has a weak body.

370
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:06,440
He predicted that

371
00:24:06,440 --> 00:24:09,440
the people who have inherited the Jiao Siqin team

372
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:12,440
will kill the ones who were killed at that time.

373
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:15,440
Yilong's words are wrong.

374
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:18,440
I can't kill him.

375
00:24:18,440 --> 00:24:19,440
No.

376
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:21,440
Yilong's words are never wrong.

377
00:24:22,440 --> 00:24:24,440
Because it's not a word.

378
00:24:24,440 --> 00:24:26,440
It's a curse.

379
00:24:28,440 --> 00:24:31,440
It's my duty to kill Zhu Yan.

380
00:24:32,440 --> 00:24:34,440
If this is a curse,

381
00:24:36,440 --> 00:24:38,440
I won't be able to save him.

382
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:44,440
It's nothing.

383
00:24:46,440 --> 00:24:47,440
By the way,

384
00:24:48,440 --> 00:24:50,440
why did you go to the dungeon to see Zhao Yuanzhou alone?

385
00:24:50,440 --> 00:24:51,440
Zhao Yuanzhou and you...

386
00:24:56,440 --> 00:24:58,440
There is a problem.

387
00:25:00,440 --> 00:25:01,440
We have a secret.

388
00:25:02,440 --> 00:25:04,440
You are the problem.

389
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:22,440
What a coincidence.

390
00:25:26,440 --> 00:25:27,440
You are indeed a monkey.

391
00:25:38,440 --> 00:25:41,440
Although you guys look like the Jiao Siqin team,

392
00:25:42,440 --> 00:25:43,440
the place is quite big.

393
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:46,440
I think you are right.

394
00:25:46,440 --> 00:25:48,440
Although you look like the Jiao Siqin team,

395
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:50,440
the place is quite big.

396
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:53,440
The people behind the front and the back

397
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:54,440
are all packed.

398
00:25:54,440 --> 00:25:56,440
I can't wait to find another place to stay.

399
00:25:57,440 --> 00:25:58,440
Why is he released?

400
00:26:00,440 --> 00:26:02,440
Isn't it the Jiao Siqin team that is being built?

401
00:26:04,440 --> 00:26:06,440
I'm afraid that you guys will leave me alone.

402
00:26:06,440 --> 00:26:07,440
That's why I'm here.

403
00:26:08,440 --> 00:26:09,440
You are going to follow me.

404
00:26:10,440 --> 00:26:11,440
Don't be so rude.

405
00:26:12,440 --> 00:26:14,440
Isn't Lord Zhuo in a hurry to break the case?

406
00:26:14,440 --> 00:26:15,440
I'll help you guys to get some time.

407
00:26:16,440 --> 00:26:17,440
It's not good.

408
00:26:18,440 --> 00:26:19,440
How many are there left?

409
00:26:22,440 --> 00:26:23,440
Two.

410
00:26:24,440 --> 00:26:26,440
They are the two people that I don't know how to deal with.

411
00:26:28,440 --> 00:26:29,440
Which two?

412
00:26:30,440 --> 00:26:31,440
One woman.

413
00:26:32,440 --> 00:26:33,440
One child.

414
00:26:34,440 --> 00:26:35,440
Leave it to me.

415
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:36,440
I'm 13 years old.

416
00:26:38,440 --> 00:26:40,440
I'm not as tall as I am.

417
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:42,440
Can I?

418
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:45,440
I don't want to see anyone behind the back anymore.

419
00:26:46,440 --> 00:26:47,440
Yes.

420
00:26:54,440 --> 00:26:55,440
Take it easy.

421
00:26:56,440 --> 00:26:57,440
I'll go.

422
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:02,440
I'll go.

423
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:04,440
Take it easy.

424
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:06,440
He's in a hurry.

425
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:08,440
Although he's young,

426
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:12,440
he's a very famous figure in the capital.

427
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:14,440
He's not only good at making people,

428
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:16,440
but also good at taking medicine.

429
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:20,440
Come back.

430
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:26,440
Although he's angry,

431
00:27:26,440 --> 00:27:29,440
the number of the emperor's pulse is 9.

432
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:31,440
Why are you so sure?

433
00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:34,440
Unless...

434
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:36,440
he's not human?

435
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:42,440
The doctor is indeed good.

436
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:44,440
Look at me.

437
00:27:44,440 --> 00:27:45,440
I'm a very good figure.

438
00:27:46,440 --> 00:27:47,440
I can fight and get out of the demon.

439
00:27:56,440 --> 00:27:57,440
No one's here.

440
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:04,440
The 7014 token?

441
00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:06,440
Brother Baijiu,

442
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:09,440
I know you're not willing to,

443
00:28:10,440 --> 00:28:11,440
but if I tell you...

444
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:12,440
Who said I'm not willing to?

445
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:14,440
I'm so happy.

446
00:28:14,440 --> 00:28:15,440
I'm really not selected.

447
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:16,440
Mom, I'm going out.

448
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:34,440
Let's go.

449
00:28:38,440 --> 00:28:39,440
Here you go...

450
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:42,440
Here, here, here...

451
00:28:42,440 --> 00:28:43,440
Here, here...

452
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:46,440
Here, here, here...

453
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:50,440
Here, here, here...

454
00:29:32,440 --> 00:29:34,440
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

455
00:29:34,440 --> 00:29:36,440
I'm sorry.

456
00:29:36,440 --> 00:29:38,440
I'm sorry.

457
00:29:38,440 --> 00:29:40,440
I'm sorry.

458
00:29:40,440 --> 00:29:42,440
I'm sorry.

459
00:29:42,440 --> 00:29:44,440
I'm sorry.

460
00:29:44,440 --> 00:29:46,440
I'm sorry.

461
00:29:46,440 --> 00:29:48,440
I'm sorry.

462
00:29:48,440 --> 00:29:50,440
I'm sorry.

463
00:29:50,440 --> 00:29:52,440
I'm sorry.

464
00:29:52,440 --> 00:29:54,440
I'm sorry.

465
00:29:54,440 --> 00:29:56,440
I'm sorry.

466
00:29:56,440 --> 00:29:58,440
I'm sorry.

467
00:29:58,440 --> 00:30:00,440
I'm sorry.

468
00:30:00,440 --> 00:30:02,440
I'm sorry.

469
00:30:02,440 --> 00:30:04,440
I'm sorry.

470
00:30:08,440 --> 00:30:10,440
Who are you?

471
00:30:10,440 --> 00:30:12,440
What did you do to them?

472
00:30:12,440 --> 00:30:14,440
I'm a drug dealer.

473
00:30:14,440 --> 00:30:16,440
I'm a lawyer.

474
00:30:16,440 --> 00:30:18,440
I'm a lawyer.

475
00:30:20,440 --> 00:30:22,440
Are you interested in talking to them?

476
00:30:22,440 --> 00:30:24,440
No.

477
00:30:24,440 --> 00:30:26,440
I'll call them out now.

478
00:30:26,440 --> 00:30:28,440
Or I'll be too polite.

479
00:30:28,440 --> 00:30:30,440
Oh.

480
00:30:30,440 --> 00:30:32,440
What are you doing?

481
00:30:34,440 --> 00:30:36,440
I've never seen you so absurd.

482
00:30:40,440 --> 00:30:42,440
Mr. Hei.

483
00:30:42,440 --> 00:30:44,440
A month ago,

484
00:30:44,440 --> 00:30:46,440
there was a monster in Kunlun Mountain.

485
00:30:46,440 --> 00:30:48,440
You risked your life to kill the monster.

486
00:30:48,440 --> 00:30:50,440
You were a merit-maker.

487
00:30:52,440 --> 00:30:54,440
But you were attacked because of this case.

488
00:30:54,440 --> 00:30:56,440
You lost your transformation.

489
00:30:58,440 --> 00:31:00,440
And the blood is 달�itional in the出 outing.

490
00:31:00,440 --> 00:31:02,440
It wypulled my mind.

491
00:31:04,440 --> 00:31:06,440
Ask me then.

492
00:31:08,440 --> 00:31:10,440
You can't make time to find out.

493
00:31:10,440 --> 00:31:12,280
It's because

494
00:31:12,440 --> 00:31:14,440
you can't report to me

495
00:31:14,440 --> 00:31:16,440
that you were the one處 Дуват.

496
00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:22,440
You have to live or die.

497
00:31:24,440 --> 00:31:26,440
You're right.

498
00:31:26,440 --> 00:31:29,440
That's why I gave you the job.

499
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:33,440
I just wanted to stop being a monster.

500
00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:38,440
You don't want to make it clear to me.

501
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:41,440
I've checked it.

502
00:31:42,440 --> 00:31:44,440
Nothing is wrong.

503
00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:49,440
We can help you.

504
00:31:55,440 --> 00:31:57,440
You didn't?

505
00:32:06,440 --> 00:32:08,440
No.

506
00:32:24,440 --> 00:32:26,440
I'm sorry.

507
00:32:26,440 --> 00:32:28,440
I'm sorry.

508
00:32:28,440 --> 00:32:30,440
I'm sorry.

509
00:32:30,440 --> 00:32:32,440
I'm sorry.

510
00:32:32,440 --> 00:32:34,440
I'm sorry.

511
00:32:34,440 --> 00:32:36,440
I'm sorry.

512
00:32:36,440 --> 00:32:38,440
I'm sorry.

513
00:32:38,440 --> 00:32:40,440
I'm sorry.

514
00:32:40,440 --> 00:32:42,440
I'm sorry.

515
00:32:42,440 --> 00:32:44,440
We...

516
00:32:44,440 --> 00:32:46,440
But I'm the one who's...

517
00:32:48,440 --> 00:32:50,440
He...

518
00:32:50,440 --> 00:32:52,440
Can't stand it.

519
00:32:53,440 --> 00:32:55,440
I can't figure it out.

520
00:32:55,440 --> 00:32:58,440
Why are you so suspicious?

521
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:08,440
It's not obvious.

522
00:33:08,440 --> 00:33:10,440
I'm a monster.

523
00:33:10,440 --> 00:33:15,440
I know what people don't know.

524
00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:20,440
I know what your brother does.

525
00:33:22,440 --> 00:33:24,440
Don't be!!

526
00:33:24,440 --> 00:33:26,440
I will interview you.

527
00:33:26,440 --> 00:33:28,440
OK, fine.

528
00:33:28,440 --> 00:33:31,440
Then let's have a talk about it later.

529
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:34,440
Speak of the snail.

530
00:33:34,440 --> 00:33:36,440
What is it?

531
00:33:36,440 --> 00:33:38,440
It's coming.

532
00:33:38,440 --> 00:33:39,440
It's coming...

533
00:33:39,440 --> 00:33:41,440
I gave��고念다

534
00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:43,440
word?

535
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:46,440
What is this?

536
00:33:46,440 --> 00:33:48,440
I'm not sure if I can get out of here.

537
00:33:48,440 --> 00:33:50,440
I'm not sure.

538
00:33:50,440 --> 00:33:52,440
I'm not sure.

539
00:33:52,440 --> 00:33:54,440
I'm not sure.

540
00:33:54,440 --> 00:33:56,440
I'm not sure.

541
00:33:56,440 --> 00:33:58,440
I'm not sure.

542
00:33:58,440 --> 00:34:00,440
I'm not sure.

543
00:34:00,440 --> 00:34:02,440
I'm not sure.

544
00:34:02,440 --> 00:34:04,440
I'm not sure.

545
00:34:04,440 --> 00:34:06,440
I'm not sure.

546
00:34:06,440 --> 00:34:08,440
I'm not sure.

547
00:34:08,440 --> 00:34:10,440
I'm not sure.

548
00:34:10,440 --> 00:34:12,440
I'm not sure.

549
00:34:12,440 --> 00:34:14,440
I'm not sure.

550
00:34:14,440 --> 00:34:16,440
I'm not sure.

551
00:34:22,440 --> 00:34:24,440
This is Ji Yao Si?

552
00:34:24,440 --> 00:34:26,440
I'm not sure.

553
00:34:26,440 --> 00:34:28,440
I'm not sure.

554
00:34:32,440 --> 00:34:34,440
I'm not sure.

555
00:34:34,440 --> 00:34:36,440
Will I see him?

556
00:34:36,440 --> 00:34:38,440
Little Ghost, who do you want to see?

557
00:34:38,440 --> 00:34:40,440
Who do you want to see?

558
00:34:40,440 --> 00:34:42,440
Why are you here again?

559
00:34:42,440 --> 00:34:45,440
Why are you so quiet?

560
00:34:45,440 --> 00:34:47,440
I'm just a little quiet.

561
00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:49,440
I'm not going in.

562
00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:51,440
You don't understand?

563
00:34:52,440 --> 00:34:54,440
Didn't you hear that?

564
00:34:54,440 --> 00:34:56,440
There's a little bit of a pain in the 714.

565
00:34:56,440 --> 00:34:57,440
It's a thousand years old.

566
00:34:57,440 --> 00:34:59,440
It's like a cat's fur.

567
00:34:59,440 --> 00:35:00,440
It's like a human.

568
00:35:00,440 --> 00:35:02,440
Nonsense.

569
00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:05,440
How could it be a cat's fur?

570
00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:06,440
Really?

571
00:35:06,440 --> 00:35:08,440
I saw it with my own eyes.

572
00:35:08,440 --> 00:35:09,440
At that time,

573
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:11,440
the heavy-duty of the 714 was scattered.

574
00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:13,440
I was the only one.

575
00:35:13,440 --> 00:35:15,440
I was afraid of the cold.

576
00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:16,440
I was brave enough to go up there

577
00:35:16,440 --> 00:35:18,440
and fight with the pig.

578
00:35:18,440 --> 00:35:20,440
But I have to say,

579
00:35:20,440 --> 00:35:22,440
it's a wild animal.

580
00:35:22,440 --> 00:35:23,440
Do you think that

581
00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:24,440
Jiao Si Wei He will take me

582
00:35:24,440 --> 00:35:26,440
to the first team?

583
00:35:27,440 --> 00:35:28,440
Bai Jing.

584
00:35:29,440 --> 00:35:30,440
Hello.

585
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:38,440
Don't look at me like that.

586
00:35:38,440 --> 00:35:40,440
I'm only 13 years old.

587
00:35:40,440 --> 00:35:42,440
Don't ask me to look at me like that.

588
00:35:42,440 --> 00:35:44,440
I'm very good.

589
00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:47,440
Since the leader of the group chose you,

590
00:35:47,440 --> 00:35:50,440
it means that you must have a good character.

591
00:35:50,440 --> 00:35:52,440
Lord Zhuo is looking for me?

592
00:35:53,440 --> 00:35:55,440
I'm the hero of Chong Bai.

593
00:35:55,440 --> 00:35:56,440
Let's go.

594
00:35:56,440 --> 00:35:59,440
I'll take you to see Lord Zhuo.

595
00:36:00,440 --> 00:36:02,440
Thank you.

596
00:36:02,440 --> 00:36:04,440
You're so nice.

597
00:36:05,440 --> 00:36:07,440
What's wrong with you, Da Yao?

598
00:36:07,440 --> 00:36:08,440
Why are you here?

599
00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:10,440
Da Yao.

600
00:36:10,440 --> 00:36:11,440
Where?

601
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:14,440
Da Yao.

602
00:36:14,440 --> 00:36:15,440
Da Yao.

603
00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:16,440
Zhu Yan.

604
00:36:16,440 --> 00:36:18,440
You're the one who chose Zhu Yan?

605
00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:20,440
I'm sorry.

606
00:36:38,440 --> 00:36:39,440
I'm sorry.

607
00:37:02,440 --> 00:37:03,440
Don't be so scared.

608
00:37:04,440 --> 00:37:06,440
Zhao Yuanzhou is just a normal girl.

609
00:37:07,360 --> 00:37:08,660
He doesn't eat until you can!

610
00:37:09,700 --> 00:37:12,060
Isn't he aそれで?

611
00:37:12,760 --> 00:37:14,980
How could he eat people where he is hungry?

612
00:37:22,760 --> 00:37:24,000
Alright, let'sjo

613
00:37:24,360 --> 00:37:26,020
Moon Immortal Chen

614
00:37:26,900 --> 00:37:29,020
He comes from aucho

615
00:37:29,200 --> 00:37:30,480
to the Watch metal

616
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:32,480
I'm afraid of money.

617
00:37:32,480 --> 00:37:34,480
I'm afraid of money too.

618
00:37:42,480 --> 00:37:43,480
Hello.

619
00:37:45,480 --> 00:37:46,480
Hello.

620
00:37:57,480 --> 00:37:58,480
Hello.

621
00:38:01,480 --> 00:38:03,480
Mr. Pei, you're here.

622
00:38:03,480 --> 00:38:07,480
Let me introduce you to a new doctor, Bai Jiu.

623
00:38:09,480 --> 00:38:10,480
Hello, sister.

624
00:38:10,480 --> 00:38:13,480
Please take care of me.

625
00:38:20,480 --> 00:38:21,480
Congratulations, mom.

626
00:38:22,480 --> 00:38:23,480
Be safe.

627
00:38:26,480 --> 00:38:27,480
Hello, sister.

628
00:38:28,480 --> 00:38:30,480
Please take care of me.

629
00:38:45,480 --> 00:38:46,480
Don't misunderstand.

630
00:38:47,480 --> 00:38:48,480
I'm not here to join you.

631
00:38:50,480 --> 00:38:51,480
I'm here to pay for this token.

632
00:38:53,480 --> 00:38:54,480
If a hungry person wants to say something,

633
00:38:54,480 --> 00:38:56,480
I don't believe it.

634
00:38:57,480 --> 00:38:58,480
You're right.

635
00:38:59,480 --> 00:39:02,480
The person who wants to die is out.

636
00:39:24,480 --> 00:39:26,480
Congratulations.

637
00:39:34,480 --> 00:39:36,480
The person who killed him is now in the wind.

638
00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:38,480
I'm afraid it's a good thing that the scar has been forgotten.

639
00:39:39,480 --> 00:39:42,480
The person who killed Zhu Yan in the Jialin Temple was not a soldier.

640
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:45,480
It was the one who killed Chong Wuying.

641
00:39:46,480 --> 00:39:47,480
What?

642
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:49,480
Don't you remember?

643
00:39:50,480 --> 00:39:54,480
Chong Wuying was cruel and cruel in the Jialin Temple.

644
00:39:54,480 --> 00:39:56,480
He even hurt innocent people.

645
00:39:56,480 --> 00:39:57,480
He was punished by law.

646
00:39:57,480 --> 00:40:00,480
He shouldn't have let Chong Wuying be so special.

647
00:40:00,480 --> 00:40:02,480
He's a cruel monster.

648
00:40:02,480 --> 00:40:03,480
If he's not released,

649
00:40:03,480 --> 00:40:06,480
you can't let him go.

650
00:40:06,480 --> 00:40:09,480
Chong Wuying killed the black market under the sword.

651
00:40:09,480 --> 00:40:12,480
He sold the beast, killed the tiger and took the revenge.

652
00:40:13,480 --> 00:40:14,480
He was a famous monster.

653
00:40:15,480 --> 00:40:17,480
He fought with the enemy and fought with the people.

654
00:40:17,480 --> 00:40:20,480
Do you know what happened?

655
00:40:32,480 --> 00:40:33,480
Lord Zhenmei,

656
00:40:34,480 --> 00:40:36,480
the sun is shining and the trees are blooming.

657
00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:38,480
You want to kill people, but you can't.

658
00:40:39,480 --> 00:40:41,480
The Jialin Temple was built in 1974.

659
00:40:41,480 --> 00:40:44,480
The weather is hot and the mountains are foggy.

660
00:40:44,480 --> 00:40:47,480
What does the mountain tiger have to do with me?

661
00:41:04,480 --> 00:41:07,480
Did you ask me about the Jialin Temple?

662
00:41:09,480 --> 00:41:10,480
What are you?

663
00:41:11,480 --> 00:41:12,480
A demon.

664
00:41:12,480 --> 00:41:13,480
A demon?

665
00:41:15,480 --> 00:41:16,480
It's better to die.

666
00:41:20,480 --> 00:41:21,480
You...

667
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:25,480
I forgot to tell you.

668
00:41:26,480 --> 00:41:27,480
I'm not in a good mood.

669
00:41:27,480 --> 00:41:30,480
I like the kind of demon who kills people.

670
00:41:32,480 --> 00:41:35,480
Zhao Yanchou, calm down.

671
00:41:36,480 --> 00:41:37,480
Fan Da.

672
00:41:40,480 --> 00:41:41,480
Where's the man I'm looking for?

673
00:41:41,480 --> 00:41:42,480
General Wu.

674
00:41:42,480 --> 00:41:43,480
General Wu.

675
00:41:43,480 --> 00:41:44,480
Why are you here?

676
00:41:45,480 --> 00:41:47,480
Lord Fan said he prepared a gift for you.

677
00:41:48,480 --> 00:41:51,480
I'm here to personally welcome you.

678
00:41:56,480 --> 00:41:57,480
For eight years,

679
00:41:57,480 --> 00:41:59,480
the seven hundred people who killed the innocent

680
00:41:59,480 --> 00:42:01,480
were killed because of the demon.

681
00:42:01,480 --> 00:42:03,480
The evidence for the murder is here.

682
00:42:04,480 --> 00:42:06,480
Please take a look at it.

683
00:42:12,480 --> 00:42:14,480
This gift,

684
00:42:16,480 --> 00:42:17,480
I'll take it for you.

685
00:42:18,480 --> 00:42:19,480
You've already realized

686
00:42:19,480 --> 00:42:21,480
the determination to rebuild the Jialin Temple.

687
00:42:22,480 --> 00:42:24,480
I agree to take it for you.

688
00:42:24,480 --> 00:42:26,480
You must investigate the murder of the ghost.

689
00:42:28,480 --> 00:42:31,480
The Jialin Temple is asking you to investigate the murder of the ghost.

690
00:42:31,480 --> 00:42:33,480
It can't hurt the people.

691
00:42:33,480 --> 00:42:34,480
It can't harm the people.

692
00:42:35,480 --> 00:42:36,480
It can't hurt the people.

693
00:42:36,480 --> 00:42:38,480
It can't hurt the people.

694
00:42:38,480 --> 00:42:39,480
It can't hurt the people.

695
00:42:39,480 --> 00:42:41,480
It can't hurt the people.

696
00:42:41,480 --> 00:42:42,480
It can't harm the people.

697
00:42:42,480 --> 00:42:43,480
It can't hurt the people.

698
00:42:43,480 --> 00:42:47,480
The Jialin Temple is asking you to investigate the murder of the ghost.

699
00:42:47,480 --> 00:42:49,480
Please sign the contract.

700
00:42:50,480 --> 00:42:51,480
I'll take it back

701
00:42:51,480 --> 00:42:53,480
and explain it to you.

702
00:43:09,480 --> 00:43:12,480
Sir, please sign the contract.

703
00:43:30,480 --> 00:43:31,480
Lord Zhuo,

704
00:43:31,480 --> 00:43:33,480
there's someone behind you.

705
00:43:40,480 --> 00:43:42,480
There's someone else.

706
00:43:45,480 --> 00:43:46,480
He's gone.

707
00:43:47,480 --> 00:43:48,480
I heard that

708
00:43:48,480 --> 00:43:50,480
he refused to join the Jialin Temple.

709
00:43:51,480 --> 00:43:53,480
It's useless to join the Jialin Temple.

710
00:43:54,480 --> 00:43:56,480
Even the ghosts of Chongying

711
00:43:56,480 --> 00:43:58,480
can't see the Jialin Temple.

712
00:44:09,480 --> 00:44:12,480
The Jialin Temple is asking you to investigate the murder of the ghost.

713
00:44:12,480 --> 00:44:14,480
Please sign the contract.

714
00:44:14,480 --> 00:44:16,480
It can't hurt the people.

715
00:44:16,480 --> 00:44:18,480
It can't hurt the people.

716
00:44:18,480 --> 00:44:20,480
It can't hurt the people.

717
00:44:21,480 --> 00:44:23,480
You heard the dog barking.

718
00:44:24,480 --> 00:44:25,480
It's noisy.

719
00:44:35,480 --> 00:44:36,480
He's finally gone.

720
00:44:37,480 --> 00:44:38,480
Yes.

721
00:44:40,480 --> 00:44:42,480
It's a pity that Chong Wu won the crime.

722
00:44:43,480 --> 00:44:44,480
The real crime

723
00:44:44,480 --> 00:44:48,480
was sent secretly to the Prime Minister the day before.

724
00:44:48,480 --> 00:44:50,480
If you really want to ask for forgiveness,

725
00:44:50,480 --> 00:44:52,480
Prime Minister will be sure to take action.

726
00:44:53,480 --> 00:44:56,480
The Jialin Temple is asking you to investigate the murder.

727
00:44:57,480 --> 00:45:00,480
It's important to see if the Jialin Temple can be rebuilt.

728
00:45:02,480 --> 00:45:03,480
Zhao Yunzhou,

729
00:45:03,480 --> 00:45:05,480
you'd better not talk.

730
00:45:05,480 --> 00:45:06,480
Lord Zhuo,

731
00:45:07,480 --> 00:45:08,480
believe me.

732
00:45:09,480 --> 00:45:10,480
Just do your dream.

733
00:45:40,480 --> 00:45:42,480
The Jialin Temple

734
00:45:43,480 --> 00:45:45,480
This is all the Jialin Temple about the ghost case.

735
00:45:46,480 --> 00:45:48,480
Everyone, take a look.

736
00:45:59,480 --> 00:46:00,480
Lord,

737
00:46:00,480 --> 00:46:02,480
the Jialin Temple is in a hurry.

738
00:46:09,480 --> 00:46:11,480
The Jialin Temple

739
00:46:29,480 --> 00:46:30,480
This is not a dream.

740
00:46:33,480 --> 00:46:34,480
This is blood.

741
00:46:35,480 --> 00:46:37,480
The blood of the dream.

742
00:46:39,480 --> 00:46:40,480
The Jialin Temple

743
00:47:09,480 --> 00:47:10,480
The Jialin Temple

744
