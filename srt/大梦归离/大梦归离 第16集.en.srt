[Episode 16]

3
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:48,720
Zhu Yan.

4
00:01:50,710 --> 00:01:51,590
Don't forget.

5
00:01:53,420 --> 00:01:56,509
It was you who led me out of the Wilderness.

6
00:01:59,440 --> 00:02:02,820
Only then did I get to see the vast world.

7
00:02:03,690 --> 00:02:05,760
The mortal world is noisy and bustling.

8
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:07,090
What's so good about it?

9
00:02:07,540 --> 00:02:08,740
Why must we come here?

10
00:02:10,870 --> 00:02:13,110
And every time I accompany you to the mortal world,

11
00:02:13,110 --> 00:02:14,440
I have to get this stamp.

12
00:02:15,110 --> 00:02:16,100
It's so annoying.

13
00:02:16,100 --> 00:02:16,750
Hey,

14
00:02:16,750 --> 00:02:17,440
look.

15
00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:19,160
What's this?

16
00:02:20,910 --> 00:02:24,070
♫The trees and grass of the world sway with the wind♫

17
00:02:21,510 --> 00:02:22,920
It looks really pretty.

18
00:02:24,070 --> 00:02:24,750
Dear customer,

19
00:02:24,130 --> 00:02:27,410
♫Beneath the bodhi tree, dust gathers♫

20
00:02:24,750 --> 00:02:26,070
this is not a hairpin.

21
00:02:29,450 --> 00:02:32,360
♫The good old days are gone for good like that lantern in my dream♫

22
00:02:32,430 --> 00:02:35,900
♫See immortals enter Penglai♫

23
00:02:33,590 --> 00:02:34,520
Let's go back.

24
00:02:34,770 --> 00:02:36,170
What's so fun about this?

25
00:02:36,460 --> 00:02:37,800
This is so much fun!

26
00:02:36,990 --> 00:02:40,450
♫The northern wind blows from beyond the mountains♫

27
00:02:37,880 --> 00:02:40,079
You can't find these in the Wilderness.

28
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:41,680
Who cares?

29
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:44,430
♫Along the icy river, it drifts into my dreams♫

30
00:02:42,430 --> 00:02:43,790
Sir, this is a paper windmill.

31
00:02:43,790 --> 00:02:45,390
It spins when the wind blows.

32
00:02:45,550 --> 00:02:48,640
♫Drinking wine at the Tongque Terrace♫

33
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:48,850
-Humans are so smart.
-Human are so incompetent.

34
00:02:49,620 --> 00:02:52,079
♫Even the stars feel close enough to touch♫

35
00:02:52,140 --> 00:02:56,250
♫Life and death happen in an instant, but love and hate can endure for a long time♫

36
00:02:53,980 --> 00:02:55,900
They go to all this trouble to make such things

37
00:02:55,900 --> 00:02:57,120
just to play with the wind.

38
00:02:56,500 --> 00:02:59,760
♫Beyond cause and effect♫

39
00:02:57,550 --> 00:02:58,860
In the Wilderness,

40
00:02:59,300 --> 00:03:01,580
most of us demons could do this with just a breath.

41
00:03:00,630 --> 00:03:04,410
♫The heavens endure, the world remains eternal♫

42
00:03:02,030 --> 00:03:03,830
That's why I say they're clever.

43
00:03:04,470 --> 00:03:05,560
Without magical powers,

44
00:03:04,850 --> 00:03:08,670
♫Rock and moss♫

45
00:03:05,670 --> 00:03:07,930
they can still come up with such methods.

46
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:10,250
Why are you always taking their side?

47
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:10,560
♫Are watching♫

48
00:03:10,620 --> 00:03:13,640
♫A lone boat drifts through the vast world, vanishing into mist♫

49
00:03:10,990 --> 00:03:12,150
Why not?

50
00:03:13,690 --> 00:03:16,690
♫Its sound fading away♫

51
00:03:17,930 --> 00:03:18,770
♫I wish♫

52
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:21,970
♫The sorrow of parting stayed beyond the river, and that we did not share the same mountain and moon♫

53
00:03:22,020 --> 00:03:25,840
♫Deep love, yet fate runs shallow♫

54
00:03:41,350 --> 00:03:43,010
Heaven and Earth are divided.

55
00:03:44,470 --> 00:03:46,530
Since they are two different realms,

56
00:03:46,990 --> 00:03:49,720
they must follow their respective natural laws.

57
00:03:50,990 --> 00:03:52,650
Humans are born ignorant,

58
00:03:53,230 --> 00:03:55,090
so they need to learn principles.

59
00:03:55,990 --> 00:03:57,850
Demons are naturally combative,

60
00:03:58,829 --> 00:04:00,490
so they need to be restrained.

61
00:04:01,270 --> 00:04:02,900
Baize Goddess.

62
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:07,110
I'm tired of your

63
00:04:07,550 --> 00:04:09,050
hypocritical words.

64
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:11,580
Subject all things to freedom

65
00:04:11,710 --> 00:04:13,550
and natural selection.

66
00:04:13,790 --> 00:04:15,270
That's the right way.

67
00:04:19,110 --> 00:04:20,029
Li Lun.

68
00:04:20,870 --> 00:04:22,550
Have you ever thought that

69
00:04:22,990 --> 00:04:24,920
once the Wilderness is destroyed,

70
00:04:24,990 --> 00:04:27,070
the lesser demons with weak spiritual energy

71
00:04:27,070 --> 00:04:29,910
won't be able to take human form at all?

72
00:04:29,990 --> 00:04:31,520
Along with the Wilderness,

73
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:34,320
they will be doomed too.

74
00:04:36,300 --> 00:04:38,159
The great path is hard to achieve.

75
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:42,290
Sacrifices are inevitable.

76
00:04:43,460 --> 00:04:45,750
Once the Star Formation collapses,

77
00:04:45,990 --> 00:04:47,390
it will be beyond repair.

78
00:04:48,970 --> 00:04:50,150
Zhao Yuanzhou,

79
00:04:51,700 --> 00:04:53,030
your doomsday has come.

80
00:04:55,760 --> 00:04:57,020
I know.

81
00:05:21,430 --> 00:05:22,360
If you don't die,

82
00:05:22,870 --> 00:05:24,680
I can't possibly die before you.

83
00:05:25,510 --> 00:05:26,310
Alright.

84
00:05:27,510 --> 00:05:29,590
Please make sure you keep your word.

85
00:05:29,870 --> 00:05:31,040
Let me die first.

86
00:05:32,830 --> 00:05:33,630
Ying Lei.

87
00:05:34,390 --> 00:05:35,980
I'm counting on you tomorrow.

88
00:05:35,980 --> 00:05:37,580
The future of the Wilderness

89
00:05:37,670 --> 00:05:38,800
is in your hands now.

90
00:05:41,590 --> 00:05:42,990
I will do my best.

91
00:05:43,220 --> 00:05:44,190
But

92
00:05:45,030 --> 00:05:46,430
I still can't believe it.

93
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:51,010
Zhu Yin and my grandpa were close friends for so many years.

94
00:05:51,010 --> 00:05:52,170
Why would he also...

95
00:05:54,090 --> 00:05:55,500
When I first met Zhu Yin,

96
00:05:56,610 --> 00:05:58,250
I saw that his whole body

97
00:05:58,280 --> 00:06:01,210
was surrounded by an unrelenting malicious energy.

98
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:05,470
No one knows about malicious energy

99
00:06:05,470 --> 00:06:07,460
better than I do.

100
00:06:11,910 --> 00:06:12,960
Mr. Zhuo.

101
00:06:13,330 --> 00:06:14,530
Ying Lei's safety

102
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:15,690
is in your hands now.

103
00:06:17,010 --> 00:06:18,220
But remember,

104
00:06:18,470 --> 00:06:20,060
don't come too early.

105
00:06:20,780 --> 00:06:22,250
I still want to hear

106
00:06:22,270 --> 00:06:24,330
what they're really up to.

107
00:06:26,650 --> 00:06:28,150
Then how do I judge if it's early

108
00:06:28,150 --> 00:06:28,990
or not?

109
00:06:45,750 --> 00:06:47,020
Wait for my signal.

110
00:07:10,510 --> 00:07:12,160
Ying Lei, go quickly!

111
00:07:12,670 --> 00:07:13,500
Mr. Zhuo,

112
00:07:13,530 --> 00:07:14,790
take care of yourself.

113
00:07:24,790 --> 00:07:25,590
Grandpa!

114
00:07:28,940 --> 00:07:29,780
I'm here!

115
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:30,750
Form the array.

116
00:07:31,110 --> 00:07:32,590
The stars align

117
00:07:32,700 --> 00:07:34,210
to stabilize the universe.

118
00:07:34,210 --> 00:07:35,120
Protect!

119
00:07:53,950 --> 00:07:54,940
Zhu Yin.

120
00:07:55,450 --> 00:07:56,650
Who said

121
00:07:56,670 --> 00:07:58,790
I could only struggle alone?

122
00:07:59,300 --> 00:08:00,630
Have you forgotten that

123
00:08:00,870 --> 00:08:03,430
I still have a Mountain God here?

124
00:08:33,669 --> 00:08:34,640
Mr. Zhuo,

125
00:08:34,909 --> 00:08:36,370
you're indeed reliable.

126
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:36,430
The Ancient Dragon God.

127
00:09:36,950 --> 00:09:39,000
When it opens its eyes, it's daytime.

128
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,260
When it closes its eyes, it's nighttime.

129
00:09:48,670 --> 00:09:50,850
It seems you've finally realized it.

130
00:09:51,940 --> 00:09:53,080
Wen Xiao.

131
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:56,300
You've read thousands of books,

132
00:09:57,400 --> 00:09:59,310
how did you not foresee this?

133
00:10:00,950 --> 00:10:03,670
Zhu Yin can not only summon wind and rain,

134
00:10:03,950 --> 00:10:06,530
and illuminate the nine dark and mysterious lands,

135
00:10:06,530 --> 00:10:09,310
but also control the alternation of day and night,

136
00:10:09,310 --> 00:10:10,520
making the night

137
00:10:10,590 --> 00:10:12,320
arrive early.

138
00:10:24,070 --> 00:10:25,230
Look,

139
00:10:32,520 --> 00:10:34,190
isn't this blood moon

140
00:10:35,060 --> 00:10:38,930
more beautiful than the bright moon of the mortal world?

141
00:12:05,570 --> 00:12:06,660
Jiu.

142
00:12:07,050 --> 00:12:07,980
How are you?

143
00:12:08,010 --> 00:12:09,020
Sister Pei.

144
00:12:10,710 --> 00:12:13,600
Who were those people just now?

145
00:12:14,620 --> 00:12:16,220
They were from Chongwu Camp.

146
00:12:16,610 --> 00:12:18,200
People from Chongwu Camp?

147
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:19,760
What do they want?

148
00:12:22,270 --> 00:12:23,190
I don't know.

149
00:12:24,290 --> 00:12:26,500
I was about to ask them what they were doing

150
00:12:26,500 --> 00:12:27,770
when you appeared.

151
00:12:29,900 --> 00:12:30,960
Jiu?

152
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:40,120
Sister Pei!

153
00:12:41,470 --> 00:12:43,500
Then I was knocked unconscious.

154
00:12:50,100 --> 00:12:51,130
The blood moon.

155
00:13:34,920 --> 00:13:36,070
Zhao Yuanzhou...

156
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:38,330
Zhao Yuanzhou!

157
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:45,830
He's being controlled by the malicious energy!

158
00:13:45,830 --> 00:13:46,560
Great Demon!

159
00:13:46,860 --> 00:13:47,990
Great Demon Zhu Yan!

160
00:13:56,080 --> 00:13:56,880
Zhu Yin,

161
00:13:57,350 --> 00:13:58,630
take action.

162
00:13:58,790 --> 00:14:00,420
Destroy the Baize Token.

163
00:14:01,010 --> 00:14:03,130
Break through the shackles of two realms.

164
00:14:03,130 --> 00:14:04,490
Our goal

165
00:14:04,520 --> 00:14:06,230
is about to be realized.

166
00:16:54,360 --> 00:16:55,570
This is bad.

167
00:16:55,710 --> 00:16:58,150
Li Lun's seal has been broken.

168
00:17:37,220 --> 00:17:38,940
Don't get it wrong.

169
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:41,060
Your enemy now

170
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:42,650
is not me.

171
00:18:30,510 --> 00:18:31,990
Blindness.

172
00:18:51,130 --> 00:18:52,130
Zhao Yuanzhou...

173
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:53,260
Snap out of it.

174
00:19:07,550 --> 00:19:08,640
Zhao Yuanzhou!

175
00:19:08,830 --> 00:19:09,960
Snap out of it!

176
00:19:10,390 --> 00:19:11,190
Ying Lei!

177
00:19:11,630 --> 00:19:12,420
Alright!

178
00:19:57,830 --> 00:19:58,830
Lady Goddess,

179
00:19:58,830 --> 00:19:59,760
hurry and leave!

180
00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:04,800
Look.

181
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:08,070
This is his true self.

182
00:20:11,040 --> 00:20:13,500
Now that the Baize Token has been destroyed,

183
00:20:14,850 --> 00:20:17,780
Zhao Yuanzhou's malicious energy is out of control.

184
00:20:19,830 --> 00:20:22,870
Prepare for bloodshed in the mortal world.

185
00:20:52,090 --> 00:20:53,750
Why did you teach me?

186
00:20:54,390 --> 00:20:55,870
Didn't I tell you?

187
00:20:55,950 --> 00:20:57,370
I want you to kill me.

188
00:21:01,320 --> 00:21:02,690
I, Zhuo Yichen,

189
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:05,630
swear to the heavens.

190
00:21:07,420 --> 00:21:08,710
As long as Zhu Yan teaches me

191
00:21:08,710 --> 00:21:10,970
the true way to use the Cloud Light Sword,

192
00:21:12,850 --> 00:21:15,420
I will surely slay him with my blade.

193
00:21:17,940 --> 00:21:19,160
If I break this oath,

194
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:22,680
may heaven and earth destroy me,

195
00:21:23,110 --> 00:21:24,910
and my soul scatter to the winds.

196
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:27,000
Zhuo,

197
00:21:27,170 --> 00:21:28,900
this isn't his true intention.

198
00:21:29,730 --> 00:21:32,130
He's just controlled by malicious energy.

199
00:21:33,370 --> 00:21:34,520
If I don't kill him,

200
00:21:35,890 --> 00:21:37,500
everyone will die.

201
00:21:43,470 --> 00:21:44,850
Interesting.

202
00:21:46,360 --> 00:21:48,180
You're in a dilemma.

203
00:21:48,620 --> 00:21:50,510
How will you choose?

204
00:21:51,730 --> 00:21:53,530
Baize Goddess,

205
00:21:54,670 --> 00:21:57,150
you're so protective of Zhao Yuanzhou.

206
00:21:58,790 --> 00:22:00,510
But do you know

207
00:22:01,260 --> 00:22:03,540
that he is also your enemy?

208
00:22:05,630 --> 00:22:08,320
Your master, Zhao Wan'er,

209
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:12,380
was killed by Zhao Yuanzhou.

210
00:22:13,590 --> 00:22:16,000
He has been deceiving you all along.

211
00:22:20,830 --> 00:22:22,830
Here's a memory for you.

212
00:22:24,520 --> 00:22:26,280
Do you want to see it?

213
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:46,170
Do you dare to see it?

214
00:22:58,180 --> 00:22:59,110
Li Lun,

215
00:22:59,140 --> 00:23:00,470
do you know your crimes?

216
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:02,610
What crimes have I committed?

217
00:23:02,860 --> 00:23:04,720
You have committed three crimes.

218
00:23:04,950 --> 00:23:05,810
First,

219
00:23:05,830 --> 00:23:07,510
defying the authority of the Baize Token.

220
00:23:07,510 --> 00:23:08,470
Second,

221
00:23:08,470 --> 00:23:10,000
leaving the Wilderness without permission.

222
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:11,000
Third,

223
00:23:11,160 --> 00:23:12,940
indiscriminately killing innocents in the mortal world.

224
00:23:12,940 --> 00:23:14,120
Zhao Wan'er,

225
00:23:14,550 --> 00:23:16,940
you are just a mortal.

226
00:23:17,290 --> 00:23:20,350
Who are you to interfere in the affairs of the Wilderness?

227
00:23:20,350 --> 00:23:22,320
I carry the bloodline of Baize,

228
00:23:23,310 --> 00:23:25,520
so it is my duty to protect the Wilderness.

229
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:26,940
Of course I must intervene.

230
00:23:26,940 --> 00:23:28,810
Then I'll kill you.

231
00:23:29,510 --> 00:23:31,510
Let's see how you intervene then.

232
00:23:33,100 --> 00:23:34,290
Master!

233
00:23:36,670 --> 00:23:37,470
Wen Xiao!

234
00:23:56,590 --> 00:23:57,500
Freeze.

235
00:25:13,800 --> 00:25:16,120
What punishment will he receive?

236
00:25:18,540 --> 00:25:20,670
He will be sealed at his Place of Birth,

237
00:25:21,390 --> 00:25:22,850
repenting every day.

238
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:27,800
For someone who yearns for freedom like him,

239
00:25:29,960 --> 00:25:32,320
that might be even worse

240
00:25:33,800 --> 00:25:35,600
than having his soul scattered.

241
00:25:37,180 --> 00:25:38,230
You can't bear it?

242
00:25:40,870 --> 00:25:42,320
I almost forgot.

243
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:44,260
You're close friends.

244
00:28:17,130 --> 00:28:18,870
Go find her.

245
00:29:29,910 --> 00:29:32,450
♫A lone boat drifts through the world♫

246
00:29:32,490 --> 00:29:35,100
♫The heart feels bitter, then sweet♫

247
00:29:35,490 --> 00:29:40,510
♫Can't distinguish night from day♫

248
00:29:41,800 --> 00:29:43,730
♫At the edge of the dreamscape♫

249
00:29:43,890 --> 00:29:46,450
♫Someone is longing for♫

250
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:47,710
♫Softly calling for♫

251
00:29:47,750 --> 00:29:51,860
♫A past that can't be brought back♫

252
00:29:52,230 --> 00:29:54,860
♫The world echoes with a single sigh♫

253
00:29:54,910 --> 00:29:57,440
♫Love and hate each fills half the heart♫

254
00:29:57,670 --> 00:30:02,680
♫The years are filled with grudges and grace♫

255
00:30:03,890 --> 00:30:06,020
♫The cry of summer cicadas♫

256
00:30:06,090 --> 00:30:08,650
♫The slumber of winter snow♫

257
00:30:08,820 --> 00:30:14,050
♫No idle wishes and no hopeless longing for eternity♫

258
00:30:25,540 --> 00:30:30,300
♫The flower in my palm♫

259
00:30:30,730 --> 00:30:35,880
♫Is everchanging♫

260
00:30:36,150 --> 00:30:40,990
♫Sand slips through fingertips♫

261
00:30:41,890 --> 00:30:46,890
♫Struggling again and again♫

262
00:30:47,570 --> 00:30:52,330
♫The sea of suffering has no end♫

263
00:30:53,250 --> 00:30:57,370
♫The spring breeze asks him♫

264
00:30:57,450 --> 00:31:03,190
♫What troubles turned his hair white♫

265
00:32:26,670 --> 00:32:28,250
But if one day,

266
00:32:28,750 --> 00:32:31,410
you find out I've done something unforgivable,

267
00:32:34,490 --> 00:32:35,880
what will you do?

268
00:32:38,910 --> 00:32:41,830
Most unforgivable things in this world

269
00:32:43,400 --> 00:32:46,730
are because we can't understand why the other person did it,

270
00:32:47,310 --> 00:32:48,970
that's why it's hard to let go.

271
00:32:50,990 --> 00:32:53,190
If you're willing to tell me the reason,

272
00:32:54,220 --> 00:32:56,020
perhaps I might understand you.

273
00:33:10,660 --> 00:33:13,400
If Zhao Yuanzhou really killed Wen Xiao's master,

274
00:33:13,400 --> 00:33:15,180
why didn't you tell us before?

275
00:33:17,100 --> 00:33:19,260
What's the fun in letting you know

276
00:33:20,170 --> 00:33:22,010
the truth like that?

277
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:27,240
If you hold a grudge against Zhao Yuanzhou,

278
00:33:28,230 --> 00:33:30,990
you'll never be able to connect with him again.

279
00:33:32,910 --> 00:33:35,630
Then the Baize Token can never be merged,

280
00:33:38,160 --> 00:33:40,930
and I'll never be able to destroy it.

281
00:33:43,110 --> 00:33:45,060
To destroy the Baize Token,

282
00:33:46,080 --> 00:33:48,880
we need the most yin malicious energy in the world.

283
00:33:49,500 --> 00:33:51,340
When the blood moon appears,

284
00:33:52,150 --> 00:33:54,010
it will be extremely yin and evil.

285
00:33:55,670 --> 00:33:57,000
That's when we can do it.

286
00:33:57,360 --> 00:34:00,580
But now the Baize Token is split in two,

287
00:34:01,270 --> 00:34:04,270
attached to two different people.

288
00:34:05,430 --> 00:34:06,820
What should we do?

289
00:34:08,190 --> 00:34:09,639
We must make

290
00:34:10,360 --> 00:34:12,690
the two people who possess the Baize Token

291
00:34:13,610 --> 00:34:15,370
be of one mind.

292
00:34:27,010 --> 00:34:29,949
How do you know so much about this?

293
00:34:41,050 --> 00:34:42,820
I'm a person of my word.

294
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:45,770
Here you go.

295
00:35:02,350 --> 00:35:04,100
You know the whereabouts of the Baize Token?

296
00:35:04,100 --> 00:35:04,900
Where is it?

297
00:35:12,310 --> 00:35:13,900
It's on you.

298
00:35:18,640 --> 00:35:20,250
This is against principles!

299
00:35:21,880 --> 00:35:23,330
Whose principles?

300
00:35:24,990 --> 00:35:27,920
Heaven's, the public's, or the law's?

301
00:35:29,300 --> 00:35:31,760
I only recognize the principles in my heart.

302
00:35:46,040 --> 00:35:46,980
Grandpa!

303
00:37:19,600 --> 00:37:21,930
I don't have time to play with you anymore.

304
00:37:22,890 --> 00:37:25,870
Zhao Yuanzhou will kill all of you anyway.

305
00:37:26,490 --> 00:37:27,580
Zhuo Yichen,

306
00:37:28,170 --> 00:37:29,450
don't forget.

307
00:37:30,200 --> 00:37:31,720
At the final moment,

308
00:37:32,870 --> 00:37:35,680
your Cloud Light Sword can kill him.

309
00:37:40,170 --> 00:37:42,530
I look forward to your decision.

310
00:38:52,450 --> 00:38:53,220
Grandpa!

311
00:39:02,680 --> 00:39:03,610
Mr. Zhuo,

312
00:39:03,950 --> 00:39:05,350
don't hesitate anymore.

313
00:39:05,960 --> 00:39:07,140
Do it.

314
00:39:34,810 --> 00:39:35,760
Zhuo!

315
00:39:35,790 --> 00:39:36,850
What are you doing?

316
00:39:43,730 --> 00:39:44,530
Ying Lei!

317
00:40:45,460 --> 00:40:47,460
The Baize Token has been destroyed.

318
00:40:48,500 --> 00:40:51,140
I have finally succeeded.

319
00:40:53,600 --> 00:40:55,340
However...

320
00:40:57,790 --> 00:40:59,690
Zhao Yuanzhou.

321
00:41:01,530 --> 00:41:05,400
If you really die at the hands of Zhuo Yichen,

322
00:41:07,140 --> 00:41:08,960
it would be somewhat of a pity.

323
00:41:09,900 --> 00:41:11,630
He's not worthy of killing you.

324
00:41:16,590 --> 00:41:18,600
Please make sure you keep your word.

325
00:41:19,030 --> 00:41:19,890
But I

326
00:41:19,990 --> 00:41:21,060
can't kill you.

327
00:41:21,230 --> 00:41:22,630
You don't need to kill me.

328
00:41:22,940 --> 00:41:24,280
Just suppress me.

329
00:41:24,940 --> 00:41:26,050
What should I do?

330
00:41:29,910 --> 00:41:30,880
Zhuo!

331
00:41:31,030 --> 00:41:32,090
What are you doing?

332
00:42:02,640 --> 00:42:03,560
Mr. Zhuo,

333
00:42:03,590 --> 00:42:04,760
it's up to you now!

334
00:42:22,580 --> 00:42:23,800
Apply the blood of

335
00:42:23,960 --> 00:42:24,890
the divine race,

336
00:42:25,070 --> 00:42:26,310
the demon race,

337
00:42:26,330 --> 00:42:27,780
and the Bingyi Clan

338
00:42:27,990 --> 00:42:30,320
simultaneously on the Cloud Light Sword.

339
00:42:30,570 --> 00:42:32,060
This will maximize

340
00:42:32,090 --> 00:42:34,100
the power of the Cloud Light Sword.

341
00:43:02,040 --> 00:43:02,900
Ying Lei!

342
00:43:45,860 --> 00:43:47,770
You still won't let go?

343
00:43:50,710 --> 00:43:54,070
Then I'll cripple both your hands.

344
00:43:55,370 --> 00:43:56,940
A few minor injuries

345
00:43:56,960 --> 00:43:58,740
are nothing to worry about.

346
00:43:58,930 --> 00:44:00,100
This blood

347
00:44:00,270 --> 00:44:03,550
will only make my sword sharper!

348
00:44:20,550 --> 00:44:21,790
Dream...

349
00:44:35,360 --> 00:44:36,160
Zhuo!

350
00:44:39,540 --> 00:44:40,340
Mr. Zhuo!
