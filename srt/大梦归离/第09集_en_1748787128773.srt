1
00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:02,360
What's going on?

2
00:00:03,700 --> 00:00:06,000
Did R si an sensor have a sensor I had before?

3
00:00:18,040 --> 00:00:21,020
I can't believe this needs one...

4
00:00:24,340 --> 00:00:26,720
This might be an image memory.

5
00:00:27,980 --> 00:00:29,040
But...

6
00:00:59,040 --> 00:01:04,040
I'm sorry, but I'm not sure if I should be able to do that.

7
00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:09,040
I'm sorry, but I'm not sure if I should be able to do that.

8
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:14,040
I'm sorry, but I'm not sure if I should be able to do that.

9
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:19,040
I'm sorry, but I'm not sure if I should be able to do that.

10
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:24,040
I'm sorry, but I'm not sure if I should be able to do that.

11
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:29,040
I'm sorry, but I'm not sure if I should be able to do that.

12
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:34,040
I'm sorry, but I'm not sure if I should be able to do that.

13
00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:39,040
I'm sorry, but I'm not sure if I should be able to do that.

14
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:58,040
Are you a god?

15
00:01:58,040 --> 00:02:01,040
I am a demon.

16
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:10,040
Not only can you achieve your wish, but also can you become a demon.

17
00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:14,040
Is there a price for that?

18
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:17,040
Of course.

19
00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:20,040
I'm willing to.

20
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:25,040
Don't you want to ask me what the price is?

21
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:27,040
What price?

22
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:31,040
I'm willing to.

23
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:50,040
I'm willing to.

24
00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:16,040
God, Bodhisattva, let me be a strong and strong warrior.

25
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:22,040
Let me help you.

26
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:28,040
Let me not be alone.

27
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:33,040
Let me be a happy and free woman.

28
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:36,040
A woman who is not comfortable.

29
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:40,040
Because I'm not by your side.

30
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:44,040
Don't be angry.

31
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:49,040
Look at how strong her heart is.

32
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:55,040
She is a god, but she is determined.

33
00:03:55,040 --> 00:04:03,040
Everything she has done is to live on and share your worries.

34
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:06,040
I'm willing to.

35
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:09,040
But you...

36
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:16,040
I'm willing to doubt her and humiliate her.

37
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:19,040
She wants to take the bow and sword and share it with you.

38
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:24,040
But in the end, she dies under your care.

39
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:30,040
Is this life worth it?

40
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:34,040
Shut up.

41
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:42,040
You want to kill me?

42
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:50,040
Just like killing your brother?

43
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:58,040
Just let go of my hand.

44
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:02,040
But what's the use of killing me?

45
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:07,040
It's just a sin to bully others.

46
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:12,040
I helped her realize her wish.

47
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:14,040
And you...

48
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:18,040
You said that for her,

49
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:22,040
but you made her suffer so much.

50
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:26,040
But you made her suffer so much.

51
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:33,040
You don't want to be a demon.

52
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:35,040
Pei Si Jin.

53
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:42,040
You shouldn't have been like me.

54
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:47,040
You should have been like yourself.

55
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:58,040
You are so heartless.

56
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:03,040
Did Pei Si Heng know that you cried for him?

57
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:07,040
You were so heartless every night after his death.

58
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:10,040
Did you have that feeling?

59
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:17,040
Did you ever understand him

60
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:21,040
and truly understand him?

61
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:27,040
Until he died,

62
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:31,040
you left him one last thing to say.

63
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:34,040
You are so heartless.

64
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:37,040
You are so heartless.

65
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:50,040
I did it.

66
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:55,040
Actually, you are also guilty.

67
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:57,040
You want to say sorry to Heng

68
00:06:57,040 --> 00:07:01,040
and say sorry to him personally.

69
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:03,040
Right?

70
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:05,040
Yes.

71
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:09,040
I did it.

72
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:16,040
I can take you to see Heng.

73
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:22,040
I can ask you to say sorry to him personally.

74
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:26,040
Pei Si Jin.

75
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:29,040
Are you willing to do that?

76
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:30,040
Pei Si Jin.

77
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:32,040
Pei Si Jin, don't believe him.

78
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:34,040
Pei Si Jin, let me in.

79
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:36,040
Pei Si Jin.

80
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:50,040
Are you willing to do that?

81
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:53,040
Pei Si Jin.

82
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:57,040
Pei Si Jin.

83
00:07:57,040 --> 00:07:59,040
What's wrong?

84
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:05,040
I'm willing to do that.

85
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:19,040
Pei Si Jin.

86
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:21,040
Pei Si Jin.

87
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:23,040
Pei Si Jin.

88
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:25,040
Pei Si Jin.

89
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:27,040
Pei Si Jin.

90
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:29,040
Pei Si Jin.

91
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:31,040
Pei Si Jin.

92
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:33,040
Pei Si Jin.

93
00:08:33,040 --> 00:08:35,040
Pei Si Jin.

94
00:08:35,040 --> 00:08:37,040
Pei Si Jin.

95
00:08:37,040 --> 00:08:39,040
Pei Si Jin.

96
00:08:39,040 --> 00:08:41,040
Pei Si Jin.

97
00:08:41,040 --> 00:08:43,040
Pei Si Jin.

98
00:08:43,040 --> 00:08:45,040
Pei Si Jin.

99
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:47,040
Pei Si Jin.

100
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:49,040
Pei Si Jin.

101
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:51,040
Pei Si Jin.

102
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:53,040
Pei Si Jin.

103
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:55,040
Pei Si Jin.

104
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:57,040
Pei Si Jin.

105
00:08:57,040 --> 00:08:59,040
Pei Si Jin.

106
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:01,040
Pei Si Jin.

107
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:03,040
Pei Si Jin.

108
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:05,040
Pei Si Jin.

109
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:07,040
Pei Si Jin.

110
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:09,040
Pei Si Jin.

111
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:11,040
Pei Si Jin.

112
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:13,040
Pei Si Jin.

113
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:15,040
Pei Si Jin.

114
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:17,040
Pei Si Jin.

115
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:19,040
Pei Si Jin.

116
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:21,040
Pei Si Jin.

117
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:23,040
Pei Si Jin.

118
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:25,040
Pei Si Jin.

119
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:27,040
Pei Si Jin.

120
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:29,040
Pei Si Jin.

121
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:31,040
Pei Si Jin.

122
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:33,040
Pei Si Jin.

123
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:35,040
Pei Si Jin.

124
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:37,040
Pei Si Jin.

125
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:39,040
Pei Si Jin.

126
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:41,040
Pei Si Jin.

127
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:43,040
Pei Si Jin.

128
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:45,040
Pei Si Jin.

129
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:47,040
Pei Si Jin.

130
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:49,040
Pei Si Jin.

131
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:51,040
Pei Si Jin.

132
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:53,040
Pei Si Jin.

133
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:55,040
Pei Si Jin.

134
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:57,040
Pei Si Jin.

135
00:09:57,040 --> 00:09:59,040
Pei Si Jin.

136
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:01,040
Pei Si Jin.

137
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:03,040
Pei Si Jin.

138
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:05,040
Pei Si Jin.

139
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:07,040
Pei Si Jin.

140
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:09,040
Pei Si Jee.

141
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:10,880
During the last eight days,

142
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:12,300
you didn't tell anyone for too long

143
00:10:12,300 --> 00:10:14,940
that you are really bad but kind.

144
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:27,280
The power of the útil source

145
00:10:27,280 --> 00:10:29,160
will only be姴天嘛

146
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:31,480
But we cannot stop her from running away

147
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:33,100
She won't even be able

148
00:10:33,100 --> 00:10:35,300
and won't leave the same meaning

149
00:10:35,300 --> 00:10:37,720
We can always stopクロン

150
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:39,560
He must have been deceived by this mouse

151
00:10:39,560 --> 00:10:40,920
So he became a monster

152
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:42,360
He is the most powerful

153
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:10,040
Who would be?

154
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:35,320
Jianxian

155
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:37,320
Why didn't you come to see me?

156
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:40,320
You made me like this.

157
00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:46,320
Sister.

158
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:50,320
I miss you.

159
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:00,320
Nonsense.

160
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:02,320
If you really hate your sister,

161
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:04,320
you won't want to get her forgiveness.

162
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:10,320
I did get involved in the most dangerous thing in my life.

163
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:13,320
But sister, I know I was wrong.

164
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:25,320
But she still killed her own brother.

165
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:30,320
I never asked her for forgiveness.

166
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:34,320
I never regretted it.

167
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:42,320
I'm just happy to see her.

168
00:12:45,320 --> 00:12:47,320
You think she's not happy?

169
00:12:47,320 --> 00:12:49,320
Do you think she's better than sister Pei?

170
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:52,320
She's always in pain and blame.

171
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:57,320
It's just to make her feel better.

172
00:12:57,320 --> 00:12:59,320
I don't know what it is.

173
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:01,320
I just know you're all talk.

174
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:04,320
You always say I'm a kid.

175
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:06,320
But I'm more greedy than you.

176
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:09,320
You can say anything you want.

177
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:12,320
But you're not sincere.

178
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:15,320
You should be sincere.

179
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:16,320
Am I right?

180
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:22,320
Mother, I don't understand.

181
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:23,320
I'm still young.

182
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:25,320
I don't understand.

183
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:29,320
But I hate you.

184
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:33,320
I'm so sorry.

185
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:36,320
I hate you.

186
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:41,320
I hate you for what you did.

187
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:45,320
I hate you for what you did.

188
00:13:47,320 --> 00:13:49,320
I hate you for what you did.

189
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:51,320
Heng.

190
00:13:57,320 --> 00:13:58,320
Do you hate me?

191
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:06,320
I hate myself.

192
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:09,320
You're crazy.

193
00:14:17,320 --> 00:14:20,320
The world is hard to change.

194
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:23,320
Love is hard to laugh.

195
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:28,320
All the truth will be destroyed.

196
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:30,320
Pei Si Hao.

197
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:34,320
The one who killed you is standing in front of you.

198
00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:40,320
Take revenge.

199
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:42,320
Take revenge.

200
00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:02,320
No wonder you can't beat me.

201
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:04,320
You let me try.

202
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:29,320
Zhimei.

203
00:15:31,320 --> 00:15:33,320
The blood of the Sky Pond is boiling.

204
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:36,320
Zhimei is the most popular person.

205
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:40,320
Mr. Zhou has a good voice.

206
00:15:41,320 --> 00:15:45,320
But I didn't expect you to be so strict.

207
00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:46,320
You're so stubborn.

208
00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:50,320
I'm sorry.

209
00:15:51,320 --> 00:15:52,320
I'm sorry.

210
00:15:53,320 --> 00:15:54,320
I'm sorry.

211
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:55,320
You're so stubborn.

212
00:15:59,320 --> 00:16:00,320
My stubbornness

213
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:03,320
killed many people.

214
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:10,320
The sky is like a year's worth of flowers.

215
00:16:11,320 --> 00:16:12,320
It's like a winter poison.

216
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:13,320
I don't know how hard it is.

217
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:21,320
Zhimei is cold in front of the door.

218
00:16:21,320 --> 00:16:22,320
She's so weak.

219
00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:26,320
Now she's re-examining the people.

220
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:30,320
It means that the Emperor is really in her favor.

221
00:16:31,320 --> 00:16:33,320
I killed Zhimei who controlled Zhimei.

222
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:37,320
I didn't want Zhimei to be punished for his life.

223
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:40,320
But Zhimei and I are one.

224
00:16:41,320 --> 00:16:42,320
I lost my life.

225
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:47,320
Zhimei naturally recovered her youth.

226
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:50,320
If Zhimei was killed,

227
00:16:51,320 --> 00:16:54,320
why did the crime scene appear?

228
00:16:55,320 --> 00:16:56,320
Or

229
00:16:57,320 --> 00:17:01,320
the crime scene here is also a person?

230
00:17:07,320 --> 00:17:11,320
I saw the plum blossom petals in the crime scene.

231
00:17:12,320 --> 00:17:15,320
You see the plum blossom petals on the stage.

232
00:17:17,320 --> 00:17:22,320
It means Zhimei's death is the one who killed Zhimei.

233
00:17:24,320 --> 00:17:25,320
Maybe Pei Sihan

234
00:17:27,320 --> 00:17:30,320
was just sent by the Emperor to save Zhimei's death.

235
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:50,320
The Emperor's Residence

236
00:18:03,320 --> 00:18:05,320
The yard is not full of plum blossom trees.

237
00:18:07,320 --> 00:18:09,320
Where did these flowers come from?

238
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:11,320
The planks are still warm.

239
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:13,320
That means

240
00:18:15,320 --> 00:18:16,320
the murderer hasn't left.

241
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:20,320
The murderer is still alive.

242
00:18:21,320 --> 00:18:23,320
The murderer is still alive.

243
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:26,320
The murderer is still alive.

244
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:30,320
The murderer is still alive.

245
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:46,320
We didn't understand this before.

246
00:18:47,320 --> 00:18:49,320
Why did Pei Sihan become a demon?

247
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:51,320
Why did he die?

248
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:53,320
Now I understand.

249
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:55,320
Pei Sihan

250
00:18:56,320 --> 00:18:58,320
must have also made a wish to the Emperor.

251
00:19:11,320 --> 00:19:13,320
It's really a wood-painted piece.

252
00:19:13,320 --> 00:19:14,320
Sister, it's dangerous.

253
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:15,320
Let's go back.

254
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:16,320
Sister.

255
00:19:17,320 --> 00:19:18,320
Sister.

256
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:31,320
Sister.

257
00:19:47,320 --> 00:19:48,320
Sister.

258
00:20:17,320 --> 00:20:18,320
Sister.

259
00:20:37,320 --> 00:20:38,320
Zhiyan.

260
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:41,320
Is it an accident?

261
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:43,320
The thing that my wife died.

262
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:45,320
It's quite an accident.

263
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:49,320
I didn't expect you to be as beautiful as before.

264
00:20:51,320 --> 00:20:54,320
I didn't expect you to be able to be with Lillun.

265
00:20:56,320 --> 00:20:57,320
I don't know what you're talking about.

266
00:20:58,320 --> 00:20:59,320
That Japanese ghost

267
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:02,320
is Lillun's beloved.

268
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:05,320
Yes.

269
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:07,320
What should I do?

270
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:10,320
With my understanding of Lillun

271
00:21:11,320 --> 00:21:13,320
he can't give you up without a reason.

272
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:15,320
Tell me

273
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:18,320
what you did to the people you met.

274
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:42,320
Zhao Yuanzhang's power is not enough.

275
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:45,320
Not enough?

276
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:03,320
Why do you know so much?

277
00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:15,320
For you.

278
00:22:17,320 --> 00:22:18,320
I'm talking nonsense.

279
00:22:43,320 --> 00:22:45,320
Since you know him so well

280
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:47,320
why don't you guess?

281
00:22:51,320 --> 00:22:55,320
You let Kunlun open the door, right?

282
00:22:57,320 --> 00:22:58,320
I guessed it right.

283
00:22:58,320 --> 00:23:00,320
Only a demon like me

284
00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:02,320
can do it

285
00:23:03,320 --> 00:23:05,320
in ten thousand years.

286
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:15,320
Who is it?

287
00:23:23,320 --> 00:23:24,320
Who is it?

288
00:23:31,320 --> 00:23:32,320
It's Jiyouzu.

289
00:23:43,320 --> 00:23:45,320
I'm afraid you can't tell me.

290
00:23:49,320 --> 00:23:51,320
You're so cruel.

291
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:55,320
Let me show you

292
00:23:57,320 --> 00:23:58,320
how I look like.

293
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:05,320
Who are you?

294
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:08,320
You're the grandson of Ying Zhao, right?

295
00:24:09,320 --> 00:24:10,320
You know me?

296
00:24:11,320 --> 00:24:12,320
Of course I know.

297
00:24:13,320 --> 00:24:15,320
I've been taking care of Ying Zhao.

298
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:18,320
So I don't want to hurt you.

299
00:24:19,320 --> 00:24:20,320
Get out of here.

300
00:24:21,320 --> 00:24:22,320
Since you let me stay here

301
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:25,320
I can't let anyone in.

302
00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:33,320
Just you?

303
00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:45,320
I'm sorry.

304
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:47,320
I'm sorry.

305
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:49,320
I'm sorry.

306
00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:51,320
I'm sorry.

307
00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:53,320
I'm sorry.

308
00:24:54,320 --> 00:24:55,320
I'm sorry.

309
00:24:56,320 --> 00:24:57,320
I'm sorry.

310
00:24:58,320 --> 00:24:59,320
I'm sorry.

311
00:25:00,320 --> 00:25:01,320
I'm sorry.

312
00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:03,320
I'm sorry.

313
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:05,320
I'm sorry.

314
00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:07,320
I'm sorry.

315
00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:09,320
I'm sorry.

316
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:11,320
I'm sorry.

317
00:25:11,320 --> 00:25:12,320
I'm sorry.

318
00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:25,320
Chenghuang

319
00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:28,320
You've lived for tens of thousands of years.

320
00:25:29,320 --> 00:25:30,320
You didn't take care of your old age

321
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:32,320
but you've been away from the world.

322
00:25:33,320 --> 00:25:34,320
You killed innocent people.

323
00:25:35,320 --> 00:25:36,320
Do you know that?

324
00:25:38,320 --> 00:25:40,320
You've been holding the wedding ceremony

325
00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:41,320
to kill innocent people.

326
00:25:43,320 --> 00:25:44,320
You're guilty.

327
00:25:59,320 --> 00:26:03,320
So you're a godess?

328
00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:07,320
Yes.

329
00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:10,320
I'm here to take you.

330
00:26:11,320 --> 00:26:12,320
I'll go to the Jiao Temple to get justice.

331
00:26:17,320 --> 00:26:18,320
I'm hungry.

332
00:26:19,320 --> 00:26:21,320
I'm helping them realize their wish.

333
00:26:23,320 --> 00:26:24,320
You're looking for the person you want.

334
00:26:25,320 --> 00:26:27,320
You're trying to get your heart straight.

335
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:29,320
You're going to make them the people you want

336
00:26:29,320 --> 00:26:30,320
and then you're going to control them.

337
00:26:31,320 --> 00:26:32,320
You're going to take someone else's life

338
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:33,320
and make a wish.

339
00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:35,320
Isn't that what you want?

340
00:26:37,320 --> 00:26:39,320
Can I fulfill your wish?

341
00:26:39,320 --> 00:26:40,320
Are you willing to do that?

342
00:27:07,320 --> 00:27:09,320
I'm here to take you.

343
00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:12,320
I'm here to take you.

344
00:27:13,320 --> 00:27:15,320
I'm here to take you.

345
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:18,320
I'm here to take you.

346
00:27:19,320 --> 00:27:21,320
I'm here to take you.

347
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:24,320
I'm here to take you.

348
00:27:25,320 --> 00:27:27,320
I'm here to take you.

349
00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:30,320
I'm here to take you.

350
00:27:31,320 --> 00:27:33,320
I'm here to take you.

351
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:36,320
I'm here to take you.

352
00:27:37,320 --> 00:27:39,320
I'm here to take you.

353
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:42,320
I'm here to take you.

354
00:27:43,320 --> 00:27:45,320
I'm here to take you.

355
00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:48,320
I'm here to take you.

356
00:27:49,320 --> 00:27:51,320
I'm here to take you.

357
00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:54,320
I'm here to take you.

358
00:27:55,320 --> 00:27:57,320
I'm here to take you.

359
00:27:58,320 --> 00:28:00,320
I'm here to take you.

360
00:28:01,320 --> 00:28:03,320
I'm here to take you.

361
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:06,320
I'm here to take you.

362
00:28:07,320 --> 00:28:09,320
I'm here to take you.

363
00:28:37,320 --> 00:28:38,320
It's true.

364
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:42,320
Actually, it's not your brother

365
00:28:43,320 --> 00:28:45,320
who has always been a person.

366
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:48,320
It's the mother of me.

367
00:29:07,320 --> 00:29:09,320
Let me take revenge.

368
00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:11,320
Let me see

369
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:14,320
if you, who has always been cold-blooded,

370
00:29:15,320 --> 00:29:18,320
can take revenge now.

371
00:29:37,320 --> 00:29:38,320
Thank you.

372
00:29:43,320 --> 00:29:45,320
I'm going to kill you.

373
00:29:47,320 --> 00:29:49,320
Give my brother a life.

374
00:30:08,320 --> 00:30:10,320
My brother is still alive.

375
00:30:11,320 --> 00:30:13,320
He's still alive.

376
00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:16,320
He's still alive.

377
00:30:31,320 --> 00:30:33,320
Heng is my good deed.

378
00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:36,320
I'm satisfied with it.

379
00:30:37,320 --> 00:30:39,320
I'm going to kill him,

380
00:30:40,320 --> 00:30:43,320
how about I help you?

381
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:49,320
Brother!

382
00:31:07,320 --> 00:31:14,320
The first god daughter I ever had was not good.

383
00:31:14,320 --> 00:31:19,320
You, the god daughter with only half of the white order,

384
00:31:19,320 --> 00:31:22,320
also deserve to order me to help.

385
00:31:23,320 --> 00:31:25,320
You're finally old.

386
00:31:25,320 --> 00:31:27,320
You're a little bit old.

387
00:31:27,320 --> 00:31:29,320
You're a little bit old.

388
00:31:29,320 --> 00:31:31,320
You're a little bit old.

389
00:31:31,320 --> 00:31:33,320
You're a little bit old.

390
00:31:33,320 --> 00:31:35,320
You're a little bit old.

391
00:31:36,320 --> 00:31:38,320
You're a little bit old.

392
00:31:40,320 --> 00:31:44,320
I don't want to play with you little wild cats anymore.

393
00:31:45,320 --> 00:31:48,320
Since you like to stay in the Japanese,

394
00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:53,320
then you two should stay in the heaven and earth together.

395
00:32:06,320 --> 00:32:08,320
Ah Heng.

396
00:32:15,320 --> 00:32:20,320
I've thought about it many times before.

397
00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:24,320
If I die,

398
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:27,320
will you cry for me?

399
00:32:30,320 --> 00:32:32,320
Why not?

400
00:32:35,320 --> 00:32:37,320
Of course I will.

401
00:32:42,320 --> 00:32:45,320
Because you're my brother.

402
00:32:45,320 --> 00:32:48,320
I've been a little bit old.

403
00:32:48,320 --> 00:32:51,320
I've always been cold-hearted.

404
00:32:52,320 --> 00:32:55,320
I always don't understand your emotions.

405
00:32:56,320 --> 00:32:59,320
When I was a kid,

406
00:32:59,320 --> 00:33:02,320
I was so lonely.

407
00:33:03,320 --> 00:33:06,320
Even if I die,

408
00:33:07,320 --> 00:33:10,320
you won't cry for me.

409
00:33:14,320 --> 00:33:16,320
But now,

410
00:33:18,320 --> 00:33:21,320
I just realized

411
00:33:24,320 --> 00:33:27,320
I don't want you to cry at all.

412
00:33:32,320 --> 00:33:34,320
Sister.

413
00:33:35,320 --> 00:33:38,320
Don't cry anymore.

414
00:33:39,320 --> 00:33:42,320
I don't know why you're crying for me.

415
00:33:45,320 --> 00:33:47,320
Ah Heng.

416
00:33:51,320 --> 00:33:53,320
I'm sorry, Sister.

417
00:33:54,320 --> 00:33:56,320
If...

418
00:33:57,320 --> 00:34:00,320
If I could have told you earlier...

419
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:02,320
I would have just...

420
00:34:11,320 --> 00:34:13,320
Don't be so sad.

421
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:17,320
Even if I'm not the one who killed you,

422
00:34:17,320 --> 00:34:20,320
then I'll still be the one who killed you.

423
00:34:23,320 --> 00:34:25,320
It's me.

424
00:34:25,320 --> 00:34:29,320
It's me who killed so many innocent people.

425
00:34:31,320 --> 00:34:34,320
You didn't do anything.

426
00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:48,320
I just want you to forgive me.

427
00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:52,320
Don't blame me.

428
00:35:01,320 --> 00:35:03,320
Sister.

429
00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:09,320
I'm dead.

430
00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:13,320
I can't do anything for you anymore.

431
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:22,320
Ah Heng.

432
00:35:23,320 --> 00:35:26,320
What can I do for you?

433
00:35:27,320 --> 00:35:29,320
Sister.

434
00:35:30,320 --> 00:35:32,320
Ah Heng.

435
00:35:33,320 --> 00:35:35,320
Sister.

436
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:42,320
Ah Heng.

437
00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:44,320
Ah Heng.

438
00:35:44,320 --> 00:35:46,320
Ah Heng.

439
00:35:56,320 --> 00:35:58,320
Sister.

440
00:35:58,320 --> 00:36:00,320
Sister.

441
00:36:00,320 --> 00:36:02,320
Sister.

442
00:36:02,320 --> 00:36:04,320
Sister.

443
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:06,320
Sister.

444
00:36:06,320 --> 00:36:08,320
Sister.

445
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:10,320
Sister.

446
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:12,320
Sister.

447
00:36:12,320 --> 00:36:14,320
Sister.

448
00:36:14,320 --> 00:36:16,320
Sister.

449
00:36:16,320 --> 00:36:18,320
Sister.

450
00:36:18,320 --> 00:36:20,320
Sister.

451
00:36:20,320 --> 00:36:22,320
Sister.

452
00:36:22,320 --> 00:36:24,320
Sister.

453
00:36:25,320 --> 00:36:27,320
Sister..

454
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:30,320
Sister.

455
00:36:35,320 --> 00:36:37,320
Sister.

456
00:36:37,320 --> 00:36:39,320
Sister.

457
00:36:39,320 --> 00:36:41,320
Sister.

458
00:36:50,320 --> 00:36:52,320
Sister.

459
00:36:52,320 --> 00:36:55,980
To kiss

460
00:36:58,520 --> 00:37:03,420
mourn

461
00:37:12,940 --> 00:37:15,060
UncleAN Chahuang says we should find a place like this

462
00:37:15,100 --> 00:37:16,940
to travel acrossolate Mele.

463
00:37:16,980 --> 00:37:18,100
What should we do?

464
00:37:18,240 --> 00:37:20,540
He is the one who will control the Japanese

465
00:37:20,540 --> 00:37:24,540
If he doesn't want to take the initiative, it's really hard to do.

466
00:37:45,040 --> 00:37:46,540
Immortal.

467
00:37:51,540 --> 00:37:55,540
You've been checking your cr Ted with your Guard!

468
00:37:56,540 --> 00:38:01,640
I wish that in this Bali!

469
00:38:03,540 --> 00:38:07,540
I'm willing to let those who don't like their Weatherstorms go away.

470
00:38:09,840 --> 00:38:14,340
May thevt lry if they could take you out.

471
00:38:20,540 --> 00:38:22,980
My revitalising weapon

472
00:38:23,240 --> 00:38:25,280
is the shield!

473
00:38:25,340 --> 00:38:31,540
Where did Masterщim詆 learn to play with the train for the height of this land?

474
00:38:31,800 --> 00:38:35,260
Who called this play I forgot just to watch!

475
00:38:36,540 --> 00:38:39,580
Let after me take back my shield,

476
00:38:39,660 --> 00:38:44,280
We will preserve this handgun's selector.

477
00:38:47,180 --> 00:38:49,000
Since you'll save me first,

478
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:51,000
The first god?

479
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:55,000
You don't know?

480
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:58,000
Didn't the emperor mention it just now?

481
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:01,000
How could I know when I was young?

482
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:06,000
When the first god appeared, I didn't exist.

483
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:11,000
Only an old demon like the emperor would have an connection with the first god.

484
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:16,000
Then why would the emperor have the tomb of the first god?

485
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:20,000
Could it be that the god also had a hard time getting the moon?

486
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:22,000
The emperor cheated him?

487
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:27,000
The king of the god is the two sides of the world.

488
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:29,000
He is kind and kind.

489
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:33,000
How could a bad demon like the emperor be cheated by him?

490
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:37,000
But...

491
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:42,000
You can see that the emperor is different from the person.

492
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:45,000
The emperor is different from the person.

493
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:48,000
The oil paint on it is reddish and it's fun to re-purchase.

494
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:50,000
It's very delicate.

495
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:56,000
I see.

496
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:59,000
I think I should use this person as a hostage.

497
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:07,000
Old thing, I'm number three and two.

498
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:10,000
If you don't come out, I'll destroy this demon.

499
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:12,000
I'll kill him.

500
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:15,000
Three.

501
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:17,000
Two.

502
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:21,000
One.

503
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:23,000
You're an architectural master who can call kleptomaniac.

504
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:26,000
You should work to theories of drinking water.

505
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:41,000
Do you also know the world?

506
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:46,160
Ifудiballis

507
00:40:46,160 --> 00:40:47,320
a peaceful flowering with the tree

508
00:40:47,660 --> 00:40:48,520
What gives more

509
00:40:48,700 --> 00:40:49,740
Give youNow

510
00:40:52,620 --> 00:40:53,940
agre can't you shoot

511
00:41:16,160 --> 00:41:18,160
I'm going to kill you!

512
00:41:27,160 --> 00:41:28,160
Give me back the thing.

513
00:41:29,160 --> 00:41:31,160
Or you all won't want to go out.

514
00:41:35,160 --> 00:41:37,160
I'm not in a hurry to go out.

515
00:41:37,160 --> 00:41:39,160
I just want to hear the story of Qiwen.

516
00:41:39,160 --> 00:41:43,160
What is your relationship with the god daughter of Chu?

517
00:41:44,160 --> 00:41:46,160
A evil demon who enters the sky.

518
00:41:46,160 --> 00:41:48,160
How could it be related to the god daughter?

519
00:41:48,160 --> 00:41:50,160
There's no way.

520
00:41:50,160 --> 00:41:52,160
The most cruel demon beast in the world

521
00:41:52,160 --> 00:41:55,160
is not related to Zhao Waner and his sister.

522
00:41:56,160 --> 00:41:58,160
How can you talk to me like that?

523
00:41:58,160 --> 00:42:01,160
Waner and I are really close to each other.

524
00:42:01,160 --> 00:42:02,160
But you...

525
00:42:06,160 --> 00:42:08,160
You stole the god daughter.

526
00:42:10,160 --> 00:42:12,160
You stole the palace's material.

527
00:42:13,160 --> 00:42:14,160
You're so lucky.

528
00:42:14,160 --> 00:42:15,160
Stop!

529
00:42:16,160 --> 00:42:17,160
Kill him!

530
00:42:19,160 --> 00:42:20,160
Stop!

531
00:42:22,160 --> 00:42:24,160
Is it a stop or a stop?

532
00:42:24,160 --> 00:42:25,160
A stop.

533
00:42:25,160 --> 00:42:37,160
Brother Xiao Zhu.

534
00:42:38,160 --> 00:42:39,160
Brother Xiao Zhu.

535
00:42:40,160 --> 00:42:41,160
Brother Xiao Zhu.

536
00:42:43,160 --> 00:42:45,160
I can't get out of the illusion.

537
00:42:51,160 --> 00:42:52,160
I don't think so.

538
00:42:55,160 --> 00:42:56,160
Zhao Yuanzhao.

539
00:42:56,160 --> 00:42:57,160
Where are we?

540
00:42:58,160 --> 00:42:59,160
This mountain-sweeping stone

541
00:43:00,160 --> 00:43:02,160
is where the king of the world goes to the Kunlun Gate.

542
00:43:03,160 --> 00:43:04,160
But this is not the king.

543
00:43:05,160 --> 00:43:07,160
It's just a sign of the king.

544
00:43:08,160 --> 00:43:10,160
We're still in the prime of the world.

545
00:43:14,160 --> 00:43:17,160
Why do you want to invite us here?

546
00:43:17,160 --> 00:43:21,160
You want to know about the god daughter of Chu?

547
00:43:21,160 --> 00:43:22,160
Who wants to know

548
00:43:22,160 --> 00:43:24,160
about your mature and mature love teacher?

549
00:43:25,160 --> 00:43:26,160
Hurry up and give us...

550
00:43:26,160 --> 00:43:27,160
I want to know.

551
00:43:38,160 --> 00:43:41,160
The first white-green is a second.

552
00:43:41,160 --> 00:43:43,160
The strongest demon in the world

553
00:43:43,160 --> 00:43:45,160
and the strongest god daughter

554
00:43:45,160 --> 00:43:47,160
are the same master.

555
00:43:53,160 --> 00:43:55,160
After the ancient water exchange,

556
00:43:55,160 --> 00:43:56,160
the gods fell.

557
00:43:56,160 --> 00:43:58,160
The demons in the world

558
00:43:58,160 --> 00:43:59,160
are in chaos.

559
00:43:59,160 --> 00:44:02,160
My white-green is the same master.

560
00:44:02,160 --> 00:44:04,160
The king is important.

561
00:44:04,160 --> 00:44:06,160
The guard is the best.

562
00:44:09,160 --> 00:44:11,160
The god daughter of Chu is still alive.

563
00:44:12,160 --> 00:44:14,160
Although I'm a god,

564
