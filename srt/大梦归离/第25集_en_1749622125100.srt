It's me!

32
00:02:52,140 --> 00:02:57,140
The first time I saw a giant giant, I was surprised.

33
00:02:57,140 --> 00:03:02,140
I was surprised that it was a giant.

34
00:03:02,140 --> 00:03:07,140
I was surprised that it was a giant.

35
00:03:07,140 --> 00:03:12,140
I was surprised that it was a giant.

36
00:03:12,140 --> 00:03:17,140
I was surprised that it was a giant.

37
00:03:17,140 --> 00:03:22,140
I was surprised that it was a giant.

38
00:03:22,140 --> 00:03:27,140
I was surprised that it was a giant.

39
00:03:27,140 --> 00:03:32,140
I was surprised that it was a giant.

40
00:03:32,140 --> 00:03:37,140
I was surprised that it was a giant.

41
00:03:37,140 --> 00:03:42,140
I was surprised that it was a giant.

42
00:03:42,140 --> 00:03:55,140
The kasih of等等

43
00:04:06,140 --> 00:04:10,140
Lord uncle, you're finally awake.

44
00:04:10,140 --> 00:04:11,640
Why are you in the water?

45
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:13,640
Master Xiao Zhu

46
00:04:40,140 --> 00:04:42,140
Master Xiao Zhu

47
00:04:50,140 --> 00:04:51,140
Master Zhu

48
00:05:05,140 --> 00:05:06,140
Hurry up

49
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:07,640
Where is Zhang Zitao?

50
00:05:08,140 --> 00:05:09,140
Stop him

51
00:05:11,140 --> 00:05:13,140
Stop, nothing happened

52
00:05:17,140 --> 00:05:19,140
Stop, nothing happened

53
00:05:23,140 --> 00:05:25,140
So it's the leader of the T14

54
00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:27,140
It's so late, you came to my office

55
00:05:27,640 --> 00:05:29,140
It's been a long time

56
00:05:30,140 --> 00:05:32,140
Leader, it's raining

57
00:05:32,640 --> 00:05:34,140
Let's go to the cold

58
00:06:11,140 --> 00:06:12,140
Leader

59
00:06:14,140 --> 00:06:16,140
Don't stay here, go

60
00:06:26,140 --> 00:06:28,140
Leader, leader

61
00:06:28,140 --> 00:06:29,140
Xiao Zhu

62
00:06:34,140 --> 00:06:35,140
Ying Lei

63
00:06:40,140 --> 00:06:41,140
Xiao Zhu

64
00:06:46,140 --> 00:06:47,140
Xiao Zhu

65
00:06:57,140 --> 00:06:58,140
Zhang Xing

66
00:07:11,140 --> 00:07:13,140
You are a man of the past

67
00:07:13,640 --> 00:07:15,140
You are the one who has to be careful

68
00:07:16,140 --> 00:07:17,640
You have to be careful

69
00:07:18,140 --> 00:07:19,140
You are a man of the past

70
00:07:20,140 --> 00:07:22,140
You are a man of the past

71
00:07:22,640 --> 00:07:24,140
You have to be careful

72
00:07:37,140 --> 00:07:38,140
Zhu Yichen

73
00:07:40,140 --> 00:07:42,140
Why am I here?

74
00:07:49,140 --> 00:07:50,140
Leader Xiao Zhu

75
00:07:50,140 --> 00:07:51,140
You can go there

76
00:08:02,140 --> 00:08:04,140
How long have I been in the water?

77
00:08:06,140 --> 00:08:07,140
I just remember

78
00:08:08,140 --> 00:08:09,140
I saw it

79
00:08:10,140 --> 00:08:11,140
Then

80
00:08:12,140 --> 00:08:13,140
Then

81
00:08:15,140 --> 00:08:16,140
You killed someone

82
00:08:22,140 --> 00:08:23,140
I

83
00:08:26,140 --> 00:08:27,140
Killed someone

84
00:08:37,140 --> 00:08:39,140
Zhou Yingzhou, tell me

85
00:08:40,140 --> 00:08:41,140
What happened?

86
00:08:53,140 --> 00:08:55,140
There is a demon

87
00:08:59,140 --> 00:09:01,140
Just now in Jiao Si

88
00:09:03,140 --> 00:09:05,140
You want to kill Wen Xiao

89
00:09:06,140 --> 00:09:07,140
Wen Xiao

90
00:09:10,140 --> 00:09:11,140
I want to kill Wen Xiao

91
00:09:12,140 --> 00:09:13,140
He is fine

92
00:09:15,140 --> 00:09:16,140
I saved him

93
00:09:17,140 --> 00:09:18,140
Then you hurt Ying Lei

94
00:09:19,140 --> 00:09:20,140
And ran out of Jiao Si

95
00:09:21,140 --> 00:09:23,140
Just now, you attacked a big man

96
00:09:35,140 --> 00:09:36,140
Xiao Zhu

97
00:09:45,140 --> 00:09:46,140
Xiao Zhu

98
00:09:47,140 --> 00:09:48,140
Xiao Zhu

99
00:09:50,140 --> 00:09:51,140
Xiao Zhu

100
00:10:02,140 --> 00:10:03,140
Xiao Zhu

101
00:10:05,140 --> 00:10:06,140
Xiao Zhu

102
00:10:13,140 --> 00:10:14,140
Don't you remember?

103
00:10:20,140 --> 00:10:21,140
I don't remember

104
00:10:28,140 --> 00:10:29,140
But I think

105
00:10:31,140 --> 00:10:33,140
I did it

106
00:10:36,140 --> 00:10:37,140
I

107
00:10:38,140 --> 00:10:39,140
I know this feeling

108
00:10:43,140 --> 00:10:44,140
Every time

109
00:10:45,140 --> 00:10:47,140
When I was attacked by Li Ji

110
00:10:50,140 --> 00:10:51,140
It's all like this

111
00:11:01,140 --> 00:11:02,140
Leader Zhu

112
00:11:02,140 --> 00:11:03,140
Leader Zhou

113
00:11:04,140 --> 00:11:05,140
You are a villain

114
00:11:06,140 --> 00:11:07,140
I have to attack the city

115
00:11:08,140 --> 00:11:10,140
And lock you in the prison of Jiao Si

116
00:11:11,140 --> 00:11:13,140
Wait a minute

117
00:11:13,140 --> 00:11:15,140
The lady who killed Xiao Zhu

118
00:11:16,140 --> 00:11:17,140
But the one who just killed

119
00:11:17,140 --> 00:11:18,140
It's not him

120
00:11:19,140 --> 00:11:20,140
Look

121
00:11:20,140 --> 00:11:21,140
His hands and body

122
00:11:21,140 --> 00:11:22,140
Didn't bleed

123
00:11:23,140 --> 00:11:24,140
It's so big

124
00:11:25,140 --> 00:11:26,140
Even if there is blood

125
00:11:26,140 --> 00:11:27,140
It's all been washed away

126
00:11:30,140 --> 00:11:31,140
You were here just now

127
00:11:31,140 --> 00:11:32,140
We saw it ourselves

128
00:11:33,140 --> 00:11:34,140
Don't forget

129
00:11:34,140 --> 00:11:35,140
And Hou Ying

130
00:11:35,140 --> 00:11:37,140
I just smelled the smell of the dragon

131
00:11:37,140 --> 00:11:38,140
It must be him

132
00:11:39,140 --> 00:11:41,140
Are you sure you smelled the dragon

133
00:11:42,140 --> 00:11:44,140
But it's not the one who helped Master Zhuo

134
00:11:45,140 --> 00:11:47,140
I didn't help Master Zhuo

135
00:11:48,140 --> 00:11:50,140
I really smelled the smell of the dragon

136
00:11:50,140 --> 00:11:51,140
It seems

137
00:11:53,140 --> 00:11:55,140
It seems to be him

138
00:11:57,140 --> 00:11:58,140
Even if there is a smell

139
00:11:59,140 --> 00:12:00,140
It has been washed away

140
00:12:00,140 --> 00:12:01,140
I really think Xiao Zhu

141
00:12:01,140 --> 00:12:02,140
Will not kill anyone

142
00:12:09,140 --> 00:12:10,140
Da Yao

143
00:12:12,140 --> 00:12:13,140
Da Yao, say something

144
00:12:13,140 --> 00:12:14,140
Da Yao

145
00:12:16,140 --> 00:12:17,140
I

146
00:12:19,140 --> 00:12:20,140
I really saw it

147
00:12:22,140 --> 00:12:24,140
He wanted to marry me to the death

148
00:12:31,140 --> 00:12:33,140
I was controlled by Li Ji

149
00:12:36,140 --> 00:12:38,140
I even killed Master Wen Xiao

150
00:12:40,140 --> 00:12:41,140
I killed him

151
00:12:46,140 --> 00:12:48,140
Zhao Yinchong is right

152
00:12:49,140 --> 00:12:51,140
I don't even know Wen Xiao

153
00:12:53,140 --> 00:12:55,140
There is nothing impossible

154
00:12:55,140 --> 00:12:56,140
There is nothing impossible

155
00:12:59,140 --> 00:13:00,140
Master Xiao

156
00:13:01,140 --> 00:13:02,140
Master Lei

157
00:13:04,140 --> 00:13:06,140
Can't let me continue to kill people

158
00:13:08,140 --> 00:13:10,140
Catch me to the big boss

159
00:13:25,140 --> 00:13:27,140
Master

160
00:13:52,140 --> 00:13:53,140
It's okay

161
00:13:55,140 --> 00:13:58,140
I will definitely save you

162
00:14:25,140 --> 00:14:26,140
Wen Xiao

163
00:14:27,140 --> 00:14:28,140
Wen Xiao

164
00:14:54,140 --> 00:14:55,140
When is it?

165
00:14:56,140 --> 00:14:59,140
The wish of this death is still there

166
00:15:08,140 --> 00:15:10,140
What I saw last night was clear

167
00:15:10,140 --> 00:15:12,140
It was you Ji Yaosu's Zhuo Yichen

168
00:15:12,140 --> 00:15:14,140
To help kill people

169
00:15:14,140 --> 00:15:15,140
It's too cruel

170
00:15:15,140 --> 00:15:16,140
Hurry up and save the Zhuo Yichen

171
00:15:16,140 --> 00:15:17,140
Save him

172
00:15:17,140 --> 00:15:18,140
Don't be fooled by him

173
00:15:18,140 --> 00:15:19,140
Tell him

174
00:15:19,140 --> 00:15:20,140
You Ji Yaosu people

175
00:15:20,140 --> 00:15:21,140
Can be left and right

176
00:15:22,140 --> 00:15:23,140
It's a life-saving death

177
00:15:23,140 --> 00:15:25,140
Why don't these people have a reason

178
00:15:25,140 --> 00:15:27,140
Just say you Ji Yaosu

179
00:15:27,140 --> 00:15:28,140
The Japanese and the waist optimization

180
00:15:28,140 --> 00:15:29,140
Just say you are people

181
00:15:29,140 --> 00:15:31,140
It also became a brother and sister

182
00:15:31,140 --> 00:15:33,140
Where is your Zhuo Yichen?

183
00:15:33,140 --> 00:15:34,140
Enough

184
00:15:34,140 --> 00:15:35,140
Give me money

185
00:15:35,140 --> 00:15:36,140
Master

186
00:15:38,140 --> 00:15:39,140
Hurry up and save him

187
00:15:39,140 --> 00:15:40,140
Save him

188
00:15:40,140 --> 00:15:41,140
Save him

189
00:15:41,140 --> 00:15:42,140
Save him

190
00:15:42,140 --> 00:15:43,140
Save him

191
00:15:44,140 --> 00:15:45,140
Save him

192
00:15:45,140 --> 00:15:46,140
Save him

193
00:15:46,140 --> 00:15:47,140
Save him

194
00:15:49,140 --> 00:15:50,140
Save him

195
00:15:50,140 --> 00:15:51,140
Save him

196
00:15:53,140 --> 00:15:54,140
Save him

197
00:15:55,140 --> 00:15:59,140
I have a question. Why are they only throwing me?

198
00:16:03,140 --> 00:16:05,140
My nose is clearly the most sensitive.

199
00:16:05,140 --> 00:16:07,140
I won't be able to taste the flavor of the food anymore.

200
00:16:07,140 --> 00:16:10,140
Why? This is going to last for a thousand years.

201
00:16:10,140 --> 00:16:12,140
It won't last for a thousand years.

202
00:16:12,140 --> 00:16:14,140
Mr. Shen, you're awake.

203
00:16:14,140 --> 00:16:16,140
Are you okay?

204
00:16:17,140 --> 00:16:20,140
What happened just now? Why are you so serious?

205
00:16:20,140 --> 00:16:22,140
I'm fine.

206
00:16:23,140 --> 00:16:26,140
What happened just now? Why are you so noisy?

207
00:16:27,140 --> 00:16:29,140
How did you do this?

208
00:16:29,140 --> 00:16:31,140
You didn't even return your hand?

209
00:16:34,140 --> 00:16:36,140
I dare not return my hand.

210
00:16:36,140 --> 00:16:38,140
I can't return my hand.

211
00:16:43,140 --> 00:16:45,140
Why didn't you see Dayou and Xiao Zhuang?

212
00:16:48,140 --> 00:16:50,140
Where did they go?

213
00:16:53,140 --> 00:16:57,140
Mr. Zhu was locked into the dungeon.

214
00:16:57,140 --> 00:16:59,140
The dungeon?

215
00:17:01,140 --> 00:17:04,140
Xiao Zhuang didn't control his waist force last night.

216
00:17:04,140 --> 00:17:06,140
Did he hurt you?

217
00:17:06,140 --> 00:17:08,140
Did he get hurt?

218
00:17:20,140 --> 00:17:25,140
And he ran out and hurt a big man.

219
00:17:26,140 --> 00:17:29,140
This is a personal opinion of Jing Daiwei.

220
00:17:29,140 --> 00:17:31,140
I don't think it's what Mr. Zhu did.

221
00:17:32,140 --> 00:17:35,140
It's not what you said.

222
00:17:35,140 --> 00:17:37,140
You must have evidence.

223
00:17:37,140 --> 00:17:41,140
You saw the villagers too.

224
00:17:41,140 --> 00:17:43,140
You should give them an explanation.

225
00:17:45,140 --> 00:17:47,140
As for Mr. Zhu,

226
00:17:49,140 --> 00:17:51,140
he must be familiar with it.

227
00:17:54,140 --> 00:17:56,140
That big man is awake.

228
00:17:56,140 --> 00:17:58,140
He almost got hurt.

229
00:17:58,140 --> 00:18:00,140
But he survived.

230
00:18:03,140 --> 00:18:05,140
It's good to live.

231
00:18:05,140 --> 00:18:07,140
It's good to live.

232
00:18:07,140 --> 00:18:09,140
At least no one is dead.

233
00:18:10,140 --> 00:18:13,140
It's not what Xiao Zhu did, right?

234
00:18:16,140 --> 00:18:17,140
No.

235
00:18:19,140 --> 00:18:21,140
It's all right.

236
00:18:29,140 --> 00:18:32,140
Is there a way to prove Xiao Zhu's innocence?

237
00:18:33,140 --> 00:18:35,140
I've asked the Dageng people.

238
00:18:36,140 --> 00:18:37,140
The man who was there last night

239
00:18:37,140 --> 00:18:40,140
looked exactly like Mr. Zhu.

240
00:18:41,140 --> 00:18:43,140
But he didn't have a special feature

241
00:18:43,140 --> 00:18:45,140
that can't be seen by Mr. Zhu.

242
00:18:47,140 --> 00:18:49,140
What feature?

243
00:18:50,140 --> 00:18:53,140
It's exactly what Mr. Zhu just showed up.

244
00:18:54,140 --> 00:18:56,140
The soldier.

245
00:18:57,140 --> 00:18:59,140
The man who was there was a demon.

246
00:19:00,140 --> 00:19:02,140
But he didn't know that Mr. Zhu was a demon.

247
00:19:02,140 --> 00:19:05,140
He was blind and had a blue scar.

248
00:19:12,140 --> 00:19:14,140
The demon's feature

249
00:19:15,140 --> 00:19:17,140
was a real sin.

250
00:19:17,140 --> 00:19:19,140
It was a real sin.

251
00:19:20,140 --> 00:19:22,140
Maybe the demon was

252
00:19:22,140 --> 00:19:24,140
just a blessing.

253
00:19:26,140 --> 00:19:28,140
Then now,

254
00:19:28,140 --> 00:19:30,140
can you let Xiao Zhu out?

255
00:19:36,140 --> 00:19:39,140
Did you blame me for not trusting Xiao Zhu?

256
00:19:40,140 --> 00:19:42,140
You locked him up.

257
00:19:44,140 --> 00:19:46,140
Mr. Pei, do you think we're friends?

258
00:19:47,140 --> 00:19:49,140
Of course.

259
00:19:50,140 --> 00:19:53,140
You're my best friend.

260
00:19:57,140 --> 00:19:59,140
You don't blame me?

261
00:20:03,140 --> 00:20:05,140
I appreciate you

262
00:20:05,140 --> 00:20:07,140
because of your justice.

263
00:20:08,140 --> 00:20:10,140
You chose to cut off

264
00:20:10,140 --> 00:20:12,140
your bloodline

265
00:20:12,140 --> 00:20:14,140
to protect the people of the world.

266
00:20:16,140 --> 00:20:18,140
You chose to endure the pain

267
00:20:19,140 --> 00:20:21,140
and let the law

268
00:20:21,140 --> 00:20:23,140
live in the world.

269
00:20:24,140 --> 00:20:26,140
Mr. Pei, you did this.

270
00:20:26,140 --> 00:20:28,140
You protected the people of the world

271
00:20:29,140 --> 00:20:31,140
and Xiao Zhu.

272
00:20:41,140 --> 00:20:43,140
You're really a good friend.

273
00:20:45,140 --> 00:20:47,140
Now,

274
00:20:47,140 --> 00:20:49,140
let's meet our other friend.

275
00:20:53,140 --> 00:20:55,140
Mr. Pei,

276
00:20:55,140 --> 00:20:57,140
I'm sorry.

277
00:20:57,140 --> 00:20:59,140
I'm sorry.

278
00:20:59,140 --> 00:21:01,140
I'm sorry.

279
00:21:01,140 --> 00:21:03,140
I'm sorry.

280
00:21:03,140 --> 00:21:05,140
I'm sorry.

281
00:21:05,140 --> 00:21:07,140
I'm sorry.

282
00:21:07,140 --> 00:21:09,140
I'm sorry.

283
00:21:09,140 --> 00:21:11,140
I'm sorry.

284
00:21:11,140 --> 00:21:13,140
I'm sorry.

285
00:21:13,140 --> 00:21:15,140
I'm sorry.

286
00:21:15,140 --> 00:21:17,140
I'm sorry.

287
00:21:17,140 --> 00:21:19,140
I'm sorry.

288
00:21:19,140 --> 00:21:21,140
I'm sorry.

289
00:21:21,140 --> 00:21:23,140
I'm sorry.

290
00:21:43,140 --> 00:21:45,140
Mr. Pei.

291
00:21:45,140 --> 00:21:47,140
I'm sorry.

292
00:21:55,140 --> 00:21:57,140
Xiao Zhu.

293
00:21:58,140 --> 00:22:00,140
Don't say sorry.

294
00:22:00,140 --> 00:22:03,140
You're just controlled by the demon.

295
00:22:03,140 --> 00:22:06,140
Just like Zhao Yuan Zhou was controlled by Li Jie.

296
00:22:09,140 --> 00:22:11,140
Xiao Zhu.

297
00:22:12,140 --> 00:22:14,140
Xiao Zhu.

298
00:22:15,140 --> 00:22:17,140
Xiao Zhu.

299
00:22:26,140 --> 00:22:29,140
You must go to the hospital as soon as possible.

300
00:22:29,140 --> 00:22:34,140
Otherwise, Xiao Zhu will be killed by the demon.

301
00:22:35,140 --> 00:22:38,140
But I haven't caught the demon yet.

302
00:22:38,140 --> 00:22:41,140
If I let the demon out like this,

303
00:22:41,140 --> 00:22:46,140
the people of the world will never believe that Ji Yaosu is dead.

304
00:22:48,140 --> 00:22:51,140
Isn't this the purpose of the demon?

305
00:23:04,140 --> 00:23:06,140
Teacher.

306
00:23:06,140 --> 00:23:08,140
You guessed it wrong.

307
00:23:08,140 --> 00:23:11,140
They came to Tianxiang Pavilion to find the demon.

308
00:23:11,140 --> 00:23:14,140
But why did the demon kill people?

309
00:23:14,140 --> 00:23:16,140
The demon was poisoned.

310
00:23:16,140 --> 00:23:18,140
The human organs can be mixed up.

311
00:23:18,140 --> 00:23:20,140
I didn't take the poison.

312
00:23:20,140 --> 00:23:22,140
But I can only take the human organs.

313
00:23:22,140 --> 00:23:24,140
I'll kill them for you.

314
00:23:24,140 --> 00:23:26,140
I'll kill them.

315
00:23:26,140 --> 00:23:28,140
I'll kill them.

316
00:23:28,140 --> 00:23:30,140
I'll kill them.

317
00:23:30,140 --> 00:23:32,140
I'll kill them.

318
00:23:32,140 --> 00:23:34,140
The demon is the human organs.

319
00:23:34,140 --> 00:23:36,140
It's a poison.

320
00:23:36,140 --> 00:23:38,140
But it's not a long-term plan.

321
00:23:38,140 --> 00:23:40,140
In the end,

322
00:23:40,140 --> 00:23:42,140
he can only come to me.

323
00:23:44,140 --> 00:23:46,140
Go.

324
00:23:54,140 --> 00:23:57,140
This guest is a new friend.

325
00:23:57,140 --> 00:23:59,140
What new friend?

326
00:24:00,140 --> 00:24:02,140
Isn't this the leader of the evil?

327
00:24:02,140 --> 00:24:04,140
What a coincidence.

328
00:24:04,140 --> 00:24:07,140
When will you have the ambition?

329
00:24:07,140 --> 00:24:09,140
The leader of the evil?

330
00:24:09,140 --> 00:24:11,140
Is it the leader of Ji Yaosu?

331
00:24:11,140 --> 00:24:13,140
It's so scary.

332
00:24:13,140 --> 00:24:14,140
Isn't it closed?

333
00:24:14,140 --> 00:24:16,140
How did he come out?

334
00:24:18,140 --> 00:24:20,140
But I don't dare to see people here.

335
00:24:20,140 --> 00:24:22,140
There must be something wrong.

336
00:24:25,140 --> 00:24:27,140
What do you want?

337
00:24:27,140 --> 00:24:29,140
What leader?

338
00:24:29,140 --> 00:24:31,140
Is he the monster?

339
00:24:31,140 --> 00:24:33,140
Or the monster who killed people?

340
00:24:33,140 --> 00:24:35,140
He killed people.

341
00:24:35,140 --> 00:24:37,140
He won't eat us?

342
00:24:37,140 --> 00:24:39,140
You're so scary.

343
00:24:39,140 --> 00:24:41,140
I said they were scary.

344
00:24:41,140 --> 00:24:44,140
They were all the monsters.

345
00:24:44,140 --> 00:24:46,140
They always helped monsters.

346
00:24:46,140 --> 00:24:48,140
Look, they're not the ones who succeeded.

347
00:24:48,140 --> 00:24:50,140
Evil.

348
00:24:50,140 --> 00:24:52,140
What are you talking about?

349
00:24:52,140 --> 00:24:54,140
Evil.

350
00:24:54,140 --> 00:24:56,140
Evil.

351
00:24:57,140 --> 00:24:59,140
Evil.

352
00:25:18,140 --> 00:25:20,140
The monster is the monster.

353
00:25:20,140 --> 00:25:23,140
You eat pigs and sheep all day.

354
00:25:23,140 --> 00:25:25,140
Isn't it the pig?

355
00:25:25,140 --> 00:25:27,140
No.

356
00:25:27,140 --> 00:25:29,140
Do you want to know what the real evil is?

357
00:25:29,140 --> 00:25:30,140
What?

358
00:25:30,140 --> 00:25:32,140
Don't be so stubborn.

359
00:25:32,140 --> 00:25:33,140
Let's fight.

360
00:25:33,140 --> 00:25:35,140
Don't forget.

361
00:25:35,140 --> 00:25:37,140
You're protecting the people.

362
00:25:37,140 --> 00:25:39,140
The people are sleeping in the corner.

363
00:25:39,140 --> 00:25:41,140
Not to get your money.

364
00:25:43,140 --> 00:25:45,140
Yes, we're protecting the people.

365
00:25:45,140 --> 00:25:47,140
But we can't do anything about it

366
00:25:47,140 --> 00:25:49,140
if we meet the people who are not.

367
00:25:49,140 --> 00:25:51,140
Not?

368
00:25:51,140 --> 00:25:52,140
I'm not?

369
00:25:52,140 --> 00:25:53,140
What do you mean?

370
00:25:53,140 --> 00:25:55,140
He's not the monster.

371
00:26:02,140 --> 00:26:04,140
He's not the monster.

372
00:26:13,140 --> 00:26:15,140
I said he's not the monster.

373
00:26:23,140 --> 00:26:25,140
I'm not the monster.

374
00:26:25,140 --> 00:26:27,140
I'm not the monster.

375
00:26:27,140 --> 00:26:29,140
I'm not the monster.

376
00:26:29,140 --> 00:26:31,140
I'm not the monster.

377
00:26:31,140 --> 00:26:33,140
I'm not the monster.

378
00:26:33,140 --> 00:26:35,140
I'm not the monster.

379
00:26:35,140 --> 00:26:37,140
I'm not the monster.

380
00:26:37,140 --> 00:26:39,140
I'm not the monster.

381
00:26:39,140 --> 00:26:41,140
I'm not the monster.

382
00:26:41,140 --> 00:26:43,140
I'm not the monster.

383
00:26:43,140 --> 00:26:45,140
I'm not the monster.

384
00:26:45,140 --> 00:26:47,140
I'm not the monster.

385
00:26:47,140 --> 00:26:49,140
I'm not the monster.

386
00:26:49,140 --> 00:26:51,140
I'm not the monster.

387
00:26:51,140 --> 00:26:53,140
I'm not the monster.

388
00:26:53,140 --> 00:26:55,140
I'm not the monster.

389
00:26:55,140 --> 00:26:57,140
I'm not the monster.

390
00:26:57,140 --> 00:26:59,140
I'm not the monster.

391
00:26:59,140 --> 00:27:01,140
I'm not the monster.

392
00:27:01,140 --> 00:27:03,140
I'm not the monster.

393
00:27:03,140 --> 00:27:05,140
I'm not the monster.

394
00:27:05,140 --> 00:27:07,140
I'm not the monster.

395
00:27:07,140 --> 00:27:09,140
I'm not the monster.

396
00:27:09,140 --> 00:27:11,140
I'm not the monster.

397
00:27:11,140 --> 00:27:13,140
I'm not the monster.

398
00:27:13,140 --> 00:27:15,140
I'm not the monster.

399
00:27:15,140 --> 00:27:17,140
I'm not the monster.

400
00:27:17,140 --> 00:27:19,140
I'm not the monster.

401
00:27:19,140 --> 00:27:21,140
I'm not the monster.

402
00:27:21,140 --> 00:27:23,140
I'm not the monster.

403
00:27:23,140 --> 00:27:25,140
I'm not the monster.

404
00:27:25,140 --> 00:27:27,140
I'm not the monster.

405
00:27:27,140 --> 00:27:29,140
I'm not the monster.

406
00:27:29,140 --> 00:27:31,140
I'm not the monster.

407
00:27:33,140 --> 00:27:35,140
Who is the monster?

408
00:27:35,140 --> 00:27:36,680
Come out,

409
00:27:36,680 --> 00:27:38,880
Run,

410
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:39,380
Stop that monster.

411
00:27:39,380 --> 00:27:42,380
Stop that monster.

412
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:48,880
Just smile.

413
00:27:49,140 --> 00:27:51,140
I'm sure you won't have a hard time.

414
00:27:51,140 --> 00:27:53,140
If you do, we'll be back.

415
00:28:10,140 --> 00:28:11,140
Is it really a demon?

416
00:28:11,140 --> 00:28:12,140
Who's the most evil demon?

417
00:28:12,140 --> 00:28:13,140
Demon?

418
00:28:13,140 --> 00:28:15,140
This white head must be a demon!

419
00:28:15,140 --> 00:28:16,140
It's a real demon!

420
00:28:16,140 --> 00:28:17,140
It's a real demon!

421
00:28:17,140 --> 00:28:19,140
Let's take a look!

422
00:28:19,140 --> 00:28:20,140
Are they really demons?

423
00:28:20,140 --> 00:28:21,140
They're really demons!

424
00:28:21,140 --> 00:28:23,140
Are they really demons?

425
00:28:23,140 --> 00:28:25,140
They're demons!

426
00:28:38,140 --> 00:28:41,140
Zhao Yanzhao, don't act rashly.

427
00:28:41,140 --> 00:28:43,140
Take your own life.

428
00:28:43,140 --> 00:28:44,140
Take it away.

429
00:28:48,140 --> 00:28:49,140
Commander Luo,

430
00:28:50,140 --> 00:28:52,140
the person you're looking for...

431
00:28:53,140 --> 00:28:54,140
Is he there?

432
00:29:04,140 --> 00:29:05,140
Hao Yin.

433
00:29:09,140 --> 00:29:10,140
Wenxiang.

434
00:29:10,140 --> 00:29:11,140
Yinglei.

435
00:29:11,140 --> 00:29:12,140
Take Chief Master out.

436
00:29:17,140 --> 00:29:18,140
Let's go.

437
00:29:18,140 --> 00:29:19,140
No, no, no.

438
00:29:19,140 --> 00:29:20,140
Let's go.

439
00:29:20,140 --> 00:29:21,140
No, no, no.

440
00:29:21,140 --> 00:29:22,140
Let's go.

441
00:29:22,140 --> 00:29:23,140
Let's go.

442
00:29:23,140 --> 00:29:24,140
Let's go.

443
00:29:24,140 --> 00:29:25,140
Let's go.

444
00:29:25,140 --> 00:29:26,140
What's going on?

445
00:29:26,140 --> 00:29:27,140
What's going on?

446
00:29:27,140 --> 00:29:28,140
What are you doing?

447
00:29:42,140 --> 00:29:43,140
I can't.

448
00:29:43,140 --> 00:29:44,140
I can't.

449
00:29:47,140 --> 00:29:48,140
I can't.

450
00:30:17,140 --> 00:30:19,140
How much?

451
00:30:21,140 --> 00:30:26,140
I'm going home.

452
00:30:47,140 --> 00:30:48,140
Is it you?

453
00:30:49,140 --> 00:30:50,140
It's me.

454
00:30:53,140 --> 00:30:54,140
What?

455
00:30:54,140 --> 00:30:56,140
You're not killing me?

456
00:31:08,140 --> 00:31:09,140
Who are you?

457
00:31:09,140 --> 00:31:11,140
That's what I want to know.

458
00:31:12,140 --> 00:31:14,140
You want to fuck?

459
00:31:14,140 --> 00:31:15,140
Why not screaming at me?

460
00:31:15,140 --> 00:31:17,140
I'm a drug too.

461
00:31:18,140 --> 00:31:20,140
I can't kill her.

462
00:31:22,140 --> 00:31:26,140
I should kill her myself.

463
00:31:27,140 --> 00:31:30,140
Do you know what Zhu Yan hates the most?

464
00:31:33,140 --> 00:31:35,140
He hates the most

465
00:31:37,140 --> 00:31:39,140
killing a drug.

466
00:31:46,140 --> 00:31:49,140
You planned it all, right?

467
00:31:51,140 --> 00:31:55,140
You want the world to abandon me.

468
00:31:59,140 --> 00:32:01,140
Do you understand now?

469
00:32:05,140 --> 00:32:06,140
What?

470
00:32:08,140 --> 00:32:09,140
I understand.

471
00:32:11,140 --> 00:32:12,140
I understand.

472
00:32:12,140 --> 00:32:14,140
I understand.

473
00:32:27,140 --> 00:32:31,140
You must have felt

474
00:32:33,140 --> 00:32:37,140
the weak and weak Lu Yi's abandonment.

475
00:32:38,140 --> 00:32:39,140
Their penance

476
00:32:40,140 --> 00:32:43,140
is so heavy.

477
00:32:45,140 --> 00:32:48,140
It's all because I'm not the one who's crying.

478
00:32:49,140 --> 00:32:51,140
What's the point of this?

479
00:32:52,140 --> 00:32:54,140
Do you hate it?

480
00:32:55,140 --> 00:32:56,140
You're so wrong.

481
00:32:58,140 --> 00:33:00,140
People force not the drug.

482
00:33:03,140 --> 00:33:05,140
It's the blood of the cruel.

483
00:33:06,140 --> 00:33:08,140
The drug that kills the drug.

484
00:33:09,140 --> 00:33:12,140
People hate the most.

485
00:33:13,140 --> 00:33:15,140
But you're not the one who's the one who's the most.

486
00:33:16,140 --> 00:33:18,140
They hate you too.

487
00:33:23,140 --> 00:33:24,140
They...

488
00:33:25,140 --> 00:33:27,140
They just don't know the truth.

489
00:33:28,140 --> 00:33:29,140
Really?

490
00:33:32,140 --> 00:33:34,140
They threw a statue

491
00:33:35,140 --> 00:33:38,140
and took it away.

492
00:33:39,140 --> 00:33:42,140
They couldn't have let it go and kneel down.

493
00:33:43,140 --> 00:33:45,140
Because the statue

494
00:33:46,140 --> 00:33:49,140
has been found out by the evil spirits in the inner courtyard.

495
00:33:51,140 --> 00:33:52,140
They beat you.

496
00:33:53,140 --> 00:33:54,140
They curse you.

497
00:33:55,140 --> 00:33:57,140
They're just trying to kill the evil spirits.

498
00:33:58,140 --> 00:34:00,140
They're turning into demons.

499
00:34:01,140 --> 00:34:02,140
What are you waiting for?

500
00:34:10,140 --> 00:34:12,140
You've turned into a demon.

501
00:34:14,140 --> 00:34:16,140
You're the one who's the most.

502
00:34:18,140 --> 00:34:21,140
But you've killed so many demons.

503
00:34:22,140 --> 00:34:25,140
You can't be the one who's the most.

504
00:34:26,140 --> 00:34:28,140
You're the real one.

505
00:34:30,140 --> 00:34:32,140
You're so funny.

506
00:34:33,140 --> 00:34:34,140
You're so mean.

507
00:34:35,140 --> 00:34:36,140
You're so mean.

508
00:34:37,140 --> 00:34:38,140
You're so mean.

509
00:34:39,140 --> 00:34:40,140
You're so mean.

510
00:34:42,140 --> 00:34:44,140
They don't want to play with me.

511
00:34:46,140 --> 00:34:47,140
Brother.

512
00:34:48,140 --> 00:34:49,140
Did I

513
00:34:50,140 --> 00:34:52,140
turn myself into a demon?

514
00:34:56,140 --> 00:34:58,140
I've seen so many demons.

515
00:35:00,140 --> 00:35:02,140
They all want to kill you.

516
00:35:02,140 --> 00:35:04,140
They want to kill you.

517
00:35:06,140 --> 00:35:08,140
They want to take away the demon's honor

518
00:35:09,140 --> 00:35:11,140
and the power.

519
00:35:13,140 --> 00:35:16,140
They're not just the nine demons.

520
00:35:19,140 --> 00:35:20,140
They're the swordsmen.

521
00:35:22,140 --> 00:35:23,140
The swordsmen.

522
00:35:25,140 --> 00:35:26,140
You're right.

523
00:35:27,140 --> 00:35:29,140
Those bad guys,

524
00:35:30,140 --> 00:35:32,140
the demons and the robbers

525
00:35:35,140 --> 00:35:39,140
are just the excuse to let go of their evil heart.

526
00:35:42,140 --> 00:35:44,140
These excuses won't make you stronger.

527
00:35:50,140 --> 00:35:52,140
I don't want to be like you.

528
00:35:57,140 --> 00:35:59,140
I don't want to be like you.

529
00:36:04,140 --> 00:36:06,140
You'll never be like me.

530
00:36:07,140 --> 00:36:09,140
Because you're too weak.

531
00:36:10,140 --> 00:36:12,140
You're not strong enough.

532
00:36:13,140 --> 00:36:15,140
You're weak like Zhao Yanzhou.

533
00:36:17,140 --> 00:36:18,140
You're weak.

534
00:36:26,140 --> 00:36:28,140
You're weak like Zhao Yanzhou.

535
00:36:30,140 --> 00:36:32,140
You're weak like Zhao Yanzhou.

536
00:36:33,140 --> 00:36:35,140
You're weak like Zhao Yanzhou.

537
00:36:36,140 --> 00:36:38,140
You're weak like Zhao Yanzhou.

538
00:36:39,140 --> 00:36:41,140
You're weak like Zhao Yanzhou.

539
00:36:42,140 --> 00:36:44,140
You're weak like Zhao Yanzhou.

540
00:36:45,140 --> 00:36:47,140
You're weak like Zhao Yanzhou.

541
00:36:48,140 --> 00:36:50,140
You're weak like Zhao Yanzhou.

542
00:36:51,140 --> 00:36:53,140
You're weak like Zhao Yanzhou.

543
00:36:53,140 --> 00:36:55,140
You're weak like Zhao Yanzhou.

544
00:37:08,140 --> 00:37:10,140
Do you know what you're thinking now?

545
00:37:13,140 --> 00:37:15,140
Like a mirror.

546
00:37:17,140 --> 00:37:18,140
I see you.

547
00:37:19,140 --> 00:37:21,140
I want to see a garden.

548
00:37:23,140 --> 00:37:25,140
There's a foundation for the garden.

549
00:37:26,140 --> 00:37:28,140
It's hard to predict.

550
00:37:29,140 --> 00:37:33,140
The garden is the biggest garden in the world.

551
00:37:34,140 --> 00:37:35,140
You're wrong.

552
00:37:36,140 --> 00:37:40,140
If I don't jump down, I won't call it a garden.

553
00:37:41,140 --> 00:37:44,140
You just want to see me jump down.

554
00:37:45,140 --> 00:37:48,140
If I jump down, I'll become you.

555
00:37:49,140 --> 00:37:51,140
You'll be disappointed.

556
00:37:52,140 --> 00:37:54,140
We're not weak.

557
00:37:55,140 --> 00:37:57,140
We're kind and kind.

558
00:37:58,140 --> 00:38:01,140
We can't suppress evil.

559
00:38:02,140 --> 00:38:04,140
Everything will go back.

560
00:38:05,140 --> 00:38:08,140
A light will be out of the fire.

561
00:38:09,140 --> 00:38:11,140
A lamp will be left to the woman.

562
00:38:12,140 --> 00:38:14,140
We can break the darkness.

563
00:38:15,140 --> 00:38:17,140
Break the darkness.

564
00:38:22,140 --> 00:38:24,140
Ruo Yichen.

565
00:38:32,140 --> 00:38:34,140
You're so pitiful.

566
00:38:37,140 --> 00:38:40,140
You're the most lonely person in the world.

567
00:38:41,140 --> 00:38:44,140
You asked me if I was waiting for you.

568
00:38:45,140 --> 00:38:47,140
