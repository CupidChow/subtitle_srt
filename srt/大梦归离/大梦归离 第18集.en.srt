00:02:00,190 --> 00:02:01,390
This is where

4
00:02:01,390 --> 00:02:02,920
Cheng Huang took us before,

5
00:02:04,870 --> 00:02:07,450
and further on is the dangerous Wilderness,

6
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:09,680
the place of birth of all demons.

7
00:02:09,910 --> 00:02:10,470
Well...

8
00:02:11,190 --> 00:02:12,240
The Wilderness?

9
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:15,070
It sounds like a desolate area.

10
00:02:15,190 --> 00:02:15,990
Yes.

11
00:02:16,870 --> 00:02:19,180
That's why all demons yearn for the mortal world.

12
00:02:19,180 --> 00:02:20,860
But as Ran Yi said,

13
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:22,829
it is our eternal hometown.

14
00:02:22,829 --> 00:02:23,630
Brother Zhuo,

15
00:02:26,030 --> 00:02:27,670
where is the Huaijiang Valley?

16
00:02:27,670 --> 00:02:29,480
Mountain God Ying Zhao said

17
00:02:29,829 --> 00:02:31,690
we could find the Yao Water there.

18
00:02:31,870 --> 00:02:32,670
Yes.

19
00:02:33,150 --> 00:02:34,910
water of Baize

20
00:02:35,020 --> 00:02:36,420
can moisten everything.

21
00:02:36,950 --> 00:02:38,810
It can make withered wood reborn.

22
00:02:39,190 --> 00:02:40,520
So,

23
00:02:40,990 --> 00:02:42,720
as long as we find the Yao Water,

24
00:02:42,829 --> 00:02:44,490
we can repair the Baize Token.

25
00:02:46,150 --> 00:02:47,750
Let's look for the Yao Water first

26
00:02:47,750 --> 00:02:49,150
and then the Divine Wood.

27
00:02:50,630 --> 00:02:51,829
I have to

28
00:02:52,510 --> 00:02:53,910
remind you.

29
00:02:55,110 --> 00:02:55,710
What?

30
00:02:57,070 --> 00:03:00,130
Huaijiang Valley is not only a place that has Yao Water,

31
00:03:00,190 --> 00:03:02,390
but also a place where Li Lun was sealed.

32
00:03:04,710 --> 00:03:06,920
He grew up there.

33
00:03:56,950 --> 00:03:58,150
I didn't expect that

34
00:03:58,270 --> 00:04:00,270
we can use the Shanhai Portal again.

35
00:04:00,420 --> 00:04:01,150
Great Demon,

36
00:04:01,300 --> 00:04:03,620
have you ever been there?

37
00:04:08,110 --> 00:04:08,590
Hey.

38
00:04:09,110 --> 00:04:09,840
Great Demon,

39
00:04:10,030 --> 00:04:12,010
did you think of the wrong place?

40
00:04:12,310 --> 00:04:14,230
Did you think of the Demon Hunting Bureau?

41
00:04:14,230 --> 00:04:16,430
Why did the Shanhai Portal send us back?

42
00:05:13,670 --> 00:05:14,360
No.

43
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:16,520
We're not in the Demon Hunting Bureau.

44
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:18,190
But the dreamland of Li Lun.

45
00:05:18,220 --> 00:05:21,090

you have to play a game with me.

are you a human

It's so boring.

Why don't you change to an interesting one?

132

This is the most interesting question.

133

Looks like you have something to say.

I won't kill you.

146

I'm not worried about that.

147

Huh?

148
00:12:10,670 --> 00:12:12,400
You hate Zhao Yuanzhou so much.

149
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:15,840
So, you will definitely torture me in front of him.

150
00:12:15,860 --> 00:12:17,910
But you captured me alone.

151
00:12:18,660 --> 00:12:19,940
Obviously,

152
00:12:20,370 --> 00:12:22,380
you didn't intend to kill me.

153
00:12:24,340 --> 00:12:26,530
So, I want to see

154
00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:29,090
what you're going to do.

155
00:12:31,910 --> 00:12:32,910
Brother Zhuo!

156
00:12:34,390 --> 00:12:35,440
Let him out,

157
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:37,720
or I'll chop you into pieces and burn you.

158
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:39,410
Liars are the worst.

159
00:12:39,470 --> 00:12:41,090
They should be eaten.

160
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:42,160
I didn't lie.

161
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:43,310
I didn't expect

162

Little Bunny is hiding something from us.

163

Wen has golden pupils.

166
00:12:50,570 --> 00:12:52,090
If I were a demon,

167
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:53,720
how can I hide it from her?

168
00:12:55,930 --> 00:12:57,240

170

Mr. Zhuo,

173

174
00:13:13,340 --> 00:13:15,340
when we were in the Sinan Water Town.

175
00:13:16,790 --> 00:13:18,650
It's useless asking for his help.

176
00:13:18,950 --> 00:13:21,210
Mr. Zhuo has always been strict and fair.

177

Don't pick a pushover to bully.

00:13:27,110 --> 00:13:28,250
I am not a pushover.

179
00:13:32,090 --> 00:13:32,880
Jiu.

180
00:13:33,710 --> 00:13:34,510
Tell me.

181
00:13:35,350 --> 00:13:36,300
Are you

182
00:13:36,330 --> 00:13:37,810
hiding anything from us?

183
00:13:43,720 --> 00:13:44,690
Brother Zhuo,

184
00:13:48,110 --> 00:13:49,510
I'm not a demon.

185
00:14:08,790 --> 00:14:09,590
Okay.

186
00:14:13,770 --> 00:14:14,840
Mr. Zhuo,

187
00:14:15,550 --> 00:14:16,880
do you trust me?

188
00:14:22,340 --> 00:14:24,200
I only trust my Cloud Light Sword.

189
00:14:39,540 --> 00:14:44,830
â™«Has anyone seen a bird with a broken tail?â™«

190
00:14:44,940 --> 00:14:50,120
â™«The rain wet its feathersâ™«

191
00:14:51,830 --> 00:14:57,090
â™«There're no worries in its eyesâ™«

192
00:14:57,260 --> 00:15:02,510
â™«It just wants to sleep on a roofâ™«

193
00:15:03,420 --> 00:15:06,360
â™«The bell jingles and swaysâ™«

194
00:15:06,460 --> 00:15:09,330
â™«Thoughts circle back and forthâ™«

195
00:15:09,880 --> 00:15:15,070
â™«Who can truly understand the essence of growing up?â™«

196
00:15:15,710 --> 00:15:19,250
â™«Life is grandâ™«

197
00:15:19,640 --> 00:15:22,020
â™«Yet so smallâ™«

198
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:21,440
It seems that Jiu is a human.

199
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:23,420
If he were a demon,

200
00:15:22,520 --> 00:15:27,090
â™«I hope everything is fineâ™«

201
00:15:23,700 --> 00:15:26,030
the Cloud Light Sword would have reacted.

202
00:15:26,780 --> 00:15:28,510
I'm not a demon.

203
00:15:28,910 --> 00:15:30,790
But you lied.

204
00:15:35,710 --> 00:15:37,630
The pagoda spirit makes sense.

205
00:15:38,510 --> 00:15:39,370
Zhao Yuanzhou,

206
00:15:39,790 --> 00:15:40,790
stop it.

207
00:15:40,970 --> 00:15:42,020
Okay.

208
00:15:43,280 --> 00:15:45,270
I was just joking

209
00:15:45,290 --> 00:15:46,690
since you're so nervous.

210
00:15:47,310 --> 00:15:49,270
I know Little Bunny is not a demon.

211
00:15:49,870 --> 00:15:53,400
No demon can hide from the Golden Pupils of the Goddess of Baize.

212
00:15:53,990 --> 00:15:54,910
Unless...

213
00:15:54,910 --> 00:15:55,840
What?

214
00:16:00,540 --> 00:16:01,500
Nothing.

215
00:16:01,970 --> 00:16:03,040
Since then,

216
00:16:03,780 --> 00:16:04,870
the liar is

217
00:16:06,210 --> 00:16:08,080
the spirit.

218
00:16:10,680 --> 00:16:11,490
Jiu.

219
00:16:12,580 --> 00:16:13,390
Step back.

220
00:16:14,550 --> 00:16:15,150
Okay.

221
00:16:35,640 --> 00:16:36,800
Mr. Zhuo!

222
00:16:36,840 --> 00:16:38,500
You really trust me this time?

223
00:16:44,340 --> 00:16:45,660
You're right.

224
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:48,020
Indeed, someone is lying.

225
00:16:48,640 --> 00:16:50,280
But it's not the four of us.

226
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:52,200
It's you.

227
00:17:01,730 --> 00:17:03,060
It's your turn.

228
00:17:03,820 --> 00:17:05,040
Are you

229
00:17:05,300 --> 00:17:06,970
human or a demon?

230
00:17:08,109 --> 00:17:09,599
Of course, I'm a demon.

231
00:17:21,349 --> 00:17:22,400
You cheated.

232
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:23,599
You're playing dirty.

233
00:17:23,599 --> 00:17:25,730
You were the one who started cheating.

234
00:17:25,750 --> 00:17:28,410
This pagoda tree is clearly under your control.

235
00:17:28,430 --> 00:17:30,390
You're trying to sow discord among us,

236
00:17:30,390 --> 00:17:32,470
and you picked the softest target.

237
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:35,970
Didn't you just say the softest target

238
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:37,770
was Mr. Zhuo?

239
00:17:39,680 --> 00:17:40,400
Huh?

240
00:17:43,750 --> 00:17:44,550
Retract.

241
00:18:08,970 --> 00:18:10,830
What were you just about to ask?

242
00:18:16,630 --> 00:18:18,390
Your true form is a pagoda tree.

243
00:18:19,350 --> 00:18:20,620
Then tell me,

244
00:18:20,710 --> 00:18:22,240
are you a demon or a monster?

245
00:18:27,310 --> 00:18:28,760
You asked me to ask,

246
00:18:29,590 --> 00:18:31,320
but when I do, you don't answer.

247
00:18:31,510 --> 00:18:32,310
What's wrong?

248
00:18:33,630 --> 00:18:35,590
Afraid I'll uncover your secrets?

249
00:18:45,980 --> 00:18:50,180
Pagoda trees are naturally prone to attracting dark and malicious energy.

250
00:18:50,870 --> 00:18:52,150
Since ancient times,

251
00:18:53,830 --> 00:18:55,720
we've been called ghost trees.

252
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:00,130
Oh,

253
00:19:01,030 --> 00:19:01,950
I understand.

254
00:19:03,070 --> 00:19:04,150
No wonder,

255
00:19:04,170 --> 00:19:06,430
the books record you as the Pagoda Ghost.

256
00:19:07,510 --> 00:19:08,310
Alright.

257
00:19:08,750 --> 00:19:09,830
Next question.

258
00:19:10,590 --> 00:19:11,250
Bring it on.

259
00:19:13,870 --> 00:19:15,280
About this rattle drum,

260
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:17,740
what's its origin?

261
00:19:23,660 --> 00:19:25,190
Zhao Yuanzhou gave it to me.

262
00:19:26,470 --> 00:19:27,280
As expected.

263
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:31,730
You know it?

264
00:19:34,040 --> 00:19:35,740
Did Zhao Yuanzhou tell you?

265
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:39,210
I saw it in the illusion of Cheng Huang's sundial.

266
00:19:46,970 --> 00:19:49,480
I want to play with the rattle drum!

267
00:19:51,030 --> 00:19:52,430
I want to play with the rattle drum!

268
00:19:52,430 --> 00:19:54,420
Be good. I'll take you home first.

269
00:19:54,830 --> 00:19:58,710
I want to play the rattle drum.

270
00:20:03,510 --> 00:20:04,310
Sir,

271
00:20:05,340 --> 00:20:06,210
how much is this?

272
00:20:06,210 --> 00:20:07,210
Five coins.

273
00:20:09,550 --> 00:20:09,950
Be good.

274
00:20:09,950 --> 00:20:10,490
Be a good boy.

275
00:20:10,490 --> 00:20:12,370
Let's go home now, alright?

276
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:16,510
No, I want to play with the rattle drum!

277
00:20:17,110 --> 00:20:18,470
Little one,

278
00:20:18,790 --> 00:20:19,670
do you like it?

279
00:20:20,910 --> 00:20:21,750
Take it.

280
00:20:21,750 --> 00:20:22,910
Thank you, Sir.

281
00:20:22,910 --> 00:20:23,350
Don't cry anymore.

282
00:20:23,350 --> 00:20:23,990
Thank you.

283
00:20:46,630 --> 00:20:48,070
What's

284
00:20:48,070 --> 00:20:49,070
this thing for?

285
00:20:52,170 --> 00:20:53,470
In the Wilderness,

286
00:20:53,670 --> 00:20:55,070
we can do many things

287
00:20:55,350 --> 00:20:56,510
with just a blink

288
00:20:56,510 --> 00:20:58,230
or a breath.

289
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:00,330
But in the mortal world,

290
00:21:00,620 --> 00:21:03,750
there are treasures that can achieve great things with minimal effort.

291
00:21:03,750 --> 00:21:05,400
Can you make others

292
00:21:05,630 --> 00:21:07,030
stop crying

293
00:21:07,160 --> 00:21:08,620
and smile?

294
00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:10,700
It can.

295
00:21:16,450 --> 00:21:18,650
Since you were once friends,

296
00:21:19,310 --> 00:21:20,670
why

297
00:21:21,350 --> 00:21:23,080
did you become mortal enemies?

298
00:21:24,910 --> 00:21:25,950
Friends?

299
00:21:31,750 --> 00:21:34,030
How do you define "friends"?

300
00:21:35,910 --> 00:21:37,550
Sharing joy and sorrow?

301
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:43,980
Ridiculous.

302
00:21:50,970 --> 00:21:52,190
"Friends" is just

303
00:21:52,190 --> 00:21:54,550
a hypocritical term you mortals use.

304
00:21:56,010 --> 00:21:58,000
Lies, deceit,

305
00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:00,850
betrayal, and slander.

306
00:22:03,670 --> 00:22:06,620
That's what your so-called friends

307
00:22:06,670 --> 00:22:08,310
are capable of.

308
00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:11,780
Is that really what you think?

309
00:22:13,190 --> 00:22:14,920
Then why

310
00:22:15,110 --> 00:22:17,570
are you still holding onto this rattle drum?

311
00:22:23,770 --> 00:22:24,570
Hey.

312
00:22:25,540 --> 00:22:26,150
Zhao Yuanzhou.

313
00:22:26,150 --> 00:22:27,150
Your umbrella.

314
00:22:28,090 --> 00:22:30,150
And that thing beside you.

315
00:22:37,870 --> 00:22:40,400
What game is Li Lun playing with you this time?

316
00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:45,120
A game to take my life.

317
00:22:51,070 --> 00:22:52,770
How much unresolved conflict

318
00:22:52,820 --> 00:22:54,640
is there between you and Li Lun?

319
00:22:57,520 --> 00:22:59,510
You've asked so many questions,

320
00:23:00,040 --> 00:23:01,230
now it's my turn.

321
00:23:04,870 --> 00:23:05,670
Go ahead.

322
00:23:07,060 --> 00:23:08,890
I have three questions.

323
00:23:10,210 --> 00:23:11,650
Answer them correctly,

324
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:13,560
and I'll let you go.

325
00:23:15,180 --> 00:23:16,820
What if I get them wrong?

326
00:23:17,960 --> 00:23:19,270
If you get them wrong,

327
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:24,290
you'll die.

328
00:23:30,710 --> 00:23:32,570
This illusion hasn't broken yet.

329
00:23:32,590 --> 00:23:34,320
Is it because there's something

330
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:35,580
you've forgotten

331
00:23:35,710 --> 00:23:37,590
but Li Lun wants you to remember?

332
00:23:39,320 --> 00:23:41,180
Seems there really is something.

333
00:24:03,470 --> 00:24:05,030
Has the mortal world changed this much?

334
00:24:05,030 --> 00:24:07,040
Don't compare it to the Wilderness.

335
00:24:07,060 --> 00:24:08,360
In the Wilderness,

336
00:24:08,550 --> 00:24:11,620
a single cloud can drift in the sky for over two hundred years.

337
00:24:11,620 --> 00:24:12,980
In that case,

338
00:24:13,660 --> 00:24:15,720
the Wilderness is a bit boring, then.

339
00:24:18,710 --> 00:24:19,680
Sir,

340
00:24:19,700 --> 00:24:20,810
how much is this?

341
00:24:21,010 --> 00:24:23,660
Sir, this umbrella is only five coins.

342
00:24:28,390 --> 00:24:30,720
Ying Zhao only gave us five coins in total.

343
00:24:30,850 --> 00:24:32,510
We should spend it sparingly.

344
00:24:39,560 --> 00:24:40,630
It's raining.

345
00:24:42,260 --> 00:24:43,920
So this is called an umbrella.

346
00:24:46,830 --> 00:24:47,870
What is it for?

347
00:24:47,980 --> 00:24:49,510
To shield one from the rain.

348
00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:51,160
Why shield from the rain?

349
00:24:51,370 --> 00:24:52,730
Wind and rain,

350
00:24:52,760 --> 00:24:54,140
snow and frost,

351
00:24:54,360 --> 00:24:55,650
everything in this world

352
00:24:55,650 --> 00:24:57,180
follows the natural order.

353
00:24:57,510 --> 00:24:58,470
I, Li Lun,

354
00:24:58,830 --> 00:24:59,950
never hide

355
00:25:00,310 --> 00:25:01,580
or retreat.

356
00:25:03,030 --> 00:25:03,830
Fine.

357
00:25:07,560 --> 00:25:11,860
[Umbrella]

358
00:25:31,970 --> 00:25:33,620
First question,

359
00:25:35,510 --> 00:25:37,610
is it better to be human

360
00:25:38,680 --> 00:25:40,320
or to be a demon?

361
00:25:40,670 --> 00:25:42,000
Being a demon is better.

362
00:25:42,390 --> 00:25:43,320
Being a demon...

363
00:25:43,920 --> 00:25:45,300
Wrong answer.

364
00:25:56,030 --> 00:25:56,990
Being human

365
00:25:59,070 --> 00:26:00,000
and being a demon

366
00:26:00,940 --> 00:26:01,740
both are good.

367
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:09,080
You can only choose one.

368
00:26:11,920 --> 00:26:13,180
I don't need to choose,

369
00:26:14,680 --> 00:26:17,340
because the heavens have already chosen for me.

370
00:26:19,510 --> 00:26:20,110
Oh?

371
00:26:20,710 --> 00:26:21,980
I was born human,

372
00:26:22,970 --> 00:26:24,320
so I can only be human.

373
00:26:26,490 --> 00:26:30,020
In truth, both humans and demons have their own good qualities.

374
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:31,660
No need to envy

375
00:26:32,140 --> 00:26:33,590
or resent each other.

376
00:26:34,800 --> 00:26:36,460
Mountains don't reject dust.

377
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:38,370
Rivers don't refuse fullness.

378
00:26:38,680 --> 00:26:40,080
Everything in this world

379
00:26:40,560 --> 00:26:41,950
has its place.

380
00:26:42,700 --> 00:26:44,210
Whether human or demon,

381
00:26:44,470 --> 00:26:46,730
what's the difference in value or worth?

382
00:26:50,830 --> 00:26:53,950
The Baize Goddess truly has a way with words.

383
00:26:55,890 --> 00:26:59,640
Since you believe both humans and demons are good,

384
00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:04,280
then let's move on to the next question.

385
00:27:05,350 --> 00:27:07,460
Do you think humans are more evil,

386
00:27:09,330 --> 00:27:11,260
or demons?

387
00:27:13,510 --> 00:27:14,710
Demons are more evil.

388
00:27:24,910 --> 00:27:26,530
Why are demons so wicked?

389
00:27:28,980 --> 00:27:30,330
My father was a good man,

390
00:27:32,190 --> 00:27:33,930
yet he was killed by a demon.

391
00:27:37,590 --> 00:27:39,510
Demons act violently,

392
00:27:40,030 --> 00:27:41,960
without regard for consequences.

393
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:44,300
But the cause of this

394
00:27:44,830 --> 00:27:45,630
was still because

395
00:27:45,630 --> 00:27:47,470
a demon's love turned to hate,

396
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:49,790
seeking revenge,

397
00:27:50,440 --> 00:27:53,040
which unfortunately implicated your father.

398
00:27:58,330 --> 00:28:00,750
Are you truly willing to follow me back to the Wilderness,

399
00:28:00,750 --> 00:28:02,610
and devote yourself to training?

400
00:28:03,080 --> 00:28:03,940
I am willing.

401
00:28:06,930 --> 00:28:08,890
Because I don't want anyone else

402
00:28:10,200 --> 00:28:11,530
to lose their loved ones

403
00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:13,770
because of demons.

404
00:28:16,080 --> 00:28:18,150
Why did you stop speaking?

405
00:28:35,860 --> 00:28:38,290
Demons come in all shapes and forms,

406
00:28:39,670 --> 00:28:40,940
and their wickedness

407
00:28:41,110 --> 00:28:42,660
is often apparent.

408
00:28:43,790 --> 00:28:45,580
The bloodthirsty kill.

409
00:28:45,900 --> 00:28:47,620
The greedy plunder.

410
00:28:48,400 --> 00:28:50,190
It's an obvious

411
00:28:50,390 --> 00:28:52,560
and blatant kind of evil.

412
00:28:53,910 --> 00:28:54,750
But humans

413
00:28:55,220 --> 00:28:57,120
each have a thousand facets.

414
00:28:57,390 --> 00:28:58,920
We are masters of disguise.

415
00:29:00,820 --> 00:29:02,040
If you're asking

416
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:03,950
who is more wicked,

417
00:29:04,770 --> 00:29:06,000
then of course,

418
00:29:06,990 --> 00:29:09,030
it's the more overtly evil demons

419
00:29:09,050 --> 00:29:10,180
who are more wicked.

420
00:29:12,390 --> 00:29:14,280
But if you're asking

421
00:29:14,500 --> 00:29:16,860
which type of evil is more dangerous

422
00:29:17,030 --> 00:29:18,710
and insidious,

423
00:29:20,950 --> 00:29:22,310
then that's...

424
00:29:25,240 --> 00:29:27,250
That's the next question.

425
00:29:36,080 --> 00:29:38,270
I quite like your answer.

426
00:29:40,580 --> 00:29:42,450
The final question.

427
00:29:45,500 --> 00:29:47,620
Between me and Zhao Yuanzhou,

428
00:29:49,640 --> 00:29:51,550
who is stronger?

429
00:29:58,930 --> 00:30:01,800
Why did your question style suddenly change?

430
00:30:10,710 --> 00:30:12,070
Answer me.

431
00:30:18,350 --> 00:30:20,300
Zhao Yuanzhou is stronger.

432
00:30:25,730 --> 00:30:27,100
Zhao Yuanzhou

433
00:30:28,310 --> 00:30:30,740
has a broader mind than you.

434
00:30:33,890 --> 00:30:35,220
He is not narrow-minded

435
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:37,870
nor extreme.

436
00:30:40,140 --> 00:30:42,340
But you, with your twisted intentions,

437
00:30:43,870 --> 00:30:45,890
will never surpass him.

438
00:31:03,820 --> 00:31:05,740
You understand him so well,

439
00:31:05,990 --> 00:31:07,830
and speak on his behalf.

440
00:31:09,300 --> 00:31:11,540
Don't you hate him?

441
00:31:12,370 --> 00:31:15,320
He did kill your master.

442
00:31:16,660 --> 00:31:18,870
You should be hating him like I do.

443
00:31:22,030 --> 00:31:24,860
We should seek revenge with him,

444
00:31:25,730 --> 00:31:26,720
shouldn't we?

445
00:31:32,300 --> 00:31:34,230
You say he's righteous.

446
00:31:37,320 --> 00:31:40,170
But he's only good at mimicking humanity.

447
00:31:41,970 --> 00:31:44,970
He's more hypocritical and deceitful than any human.

448
00:31:46,310 --> 00:31:47,810
To me,

449
00:31:48,270 --> 00:31:50,150
to Zhao Wan'er and to you,

450
00:31:51,420 --> 00:31:52,890
he's the same.

451
00:31:54,590 --> 00:31:56,580
Sooner or later,

452
00:31:58,080 --> 00:32:01,200
he will kill you just like he killed

453
00:32:02,790 --> 00:32:04,430
Zhao Wan'er.

454
00:32:09,350 --> 00:32:10,830
So,

455
00:32:13,060 --> 00:32:15,760
the one who should be suffering now

456
00:32:16,270 --> 00:32:17,230
is not me,

457
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:20,030
and not you,

458
00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:24,530
but him.

459
00:33:00,420 --> 00:33:01,570
Li Lun.

460
00:33:03,300 --> 00:33:05,480
How many times have you been deceived?

461
00:33:06,800 --> 00:33:08,360
Why don't you learn from it?

462
00:33:32,870 --> 00:33:33,550
Jiu!

463
00:33:33,580 --> 00:33:34,980
Jiu!

464
00:34:08,840 --> 00:34:10,639
What are you doing, Great Demon?

465
00:34:12,520 --> 00:34:14,370
She's not Wen Xiao.

466
00:34:18,350 --> 00:34:18,909
Wen!

467
00:34:18,909 --> 00:34:19,719
Jiu!

468
00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:40,480
Jiu, are you okay?

469
00:34:40,510 --> 00:34:41,440
I'm fine.

470
00:34:41,469 --> 00:34:42,070
Great Demon.

471
00:34:42,070 --> 00:34:43,480
What's going on?

472
00:35:02,830 --> 00:35:03,760
Wen Xiao?

473
00:35:09,830 --> 00:35:10,770
Open.

474
00:35:14,330 --> 00:35:15,880
This cage

475
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:17,730
limits my magic.

476
00:35:17,950 --> 00:35:18,650
What?

477
00:35:22,740 --> 00:35:24,580
What is this cage?

478
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:32,510
On this cage,

479
00:35:32,840 --> 00:35:35,480
there is a curse seal drawn with the blood of Zhu Jian.

480
00:35:35,480 --> 00:35:37,610
It's specially used to lock up demons.

481
00:35:38,500 --> 00:35:40,250
The demon inside this cage

482
00:35:41,500 --> 00:35:43,430
can't use any of its demonic power.

483
00:35:44,230 --> 00:35:45,380
What should we do?

484
00:35:51,490 --> 00:35:52,720
Go behind me.

485
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:17,820
Zhao Yuanzhou.

486
00:36:18,840 --> 00:36:20,550
Long time no see.

487
00:36:22,610 --> 00:36:23,910
Where is Wen Xiao?

488
00:36:25,020 --> 00:36:27,300
The final challenge is not over yet.

489
00:36:27,950 --> 00:36:29,150
What's the rush?

490
00:36:30,630 --> 00:36:31,990
If you pass,

491
00:36:33,180 --> 00:36:34,950
I'll let you see her.

492
00:36:39,590 --> 00:36:40,270
No.

493
00:36:41,230 --> 00:36:42,720
She's not Wen Xiao.

494
00:37:09,550 --> 00:37:11,050
You still want to play?

495
00:37:11,190 --> 00:37:12,190
That's right.

496
00:37:14,550 --> 00:37:15,880
What do you want to play?

497
00:37:16,870 --> 00:37:18,070
This and that.

498
00:37:19,860 --> 00:37:21,410
Choose between the two.

499
00:37:31,110 --> 00:37:32,100
Let him go.

500
00:37:34,790 --> 00:37:36,230
In the first round, I planned to

501
00:37:36,230 --> 00:37:38,620
keep this demon here.

502
00:37:39,230 --> 00:37:41,720
I didn't expect you to not give up on him.

503
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:44,770
Jiu is my friend.

504
00:37:45,470 --> 00:37:47,390
Even if I give up on myself,

505
00:37:48,110 --> 00:37:50,120
I won't give up on my friends.

506
00:37:51,170 --> 00:37:53,280
You won't give up on friends.

507
00:37:55,850 --> 00:37:57,620
You're lying again.

508
00:38:00,520 --> 00:38:01,850
Now,

509
00:38:02,460 --> 00:38:03,890
I want your life

510
00:38:04,560 --> 00:38:05,720
for his life.

511
00:38:06,540 --> 00:38:07,670
Are you willing?

512
00:38:14,570 --> 00:38:15,560
Yes.

513
00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:19,290
Zhao Yuanzhou.

514
00:38:20,290 --> 00:38:22,000
Don't listen to his nonsense.

515
00:38:22,920 --> 00:38:24,650
He is a liar.

516
00:38:25,720 --> 00:38:26,480
Jiu.

517
00:38:28,830 --> 00:38:32,230
Zhao Yuanzhou is the liar.

518
00:38:36,320 --> 00:38:38,420
This or that.

519
00:38:39,180 --> 00:38:40,590
Listen.

520
00:38:44,620 --> 00:38:46,220
Do you choose Bai Jiu

521
00:38:47,880 --> 00:38:49,520
or Zhuo Yichen?

522
00:38:51,150 --> 00:38:52,780
What for?

523
00:38:56,140 --> 00:38:58,200
Choose one to live,

524
00:38:59,720 --> 00:39:01,700
and the other one to die.

525
00:39:43,860 --> 00:39:45,540
Is it hard to choose?

526
00:39:46,830 --> 00:39:48,640
Bai Jiu is your friend.

527
00:39:49,830 --> 00:39:51,540
But Zhuo Yichen...

528
00:39:52,670 --> 00:39:55,160
is your enemy.

529
00:40:00,310 --> 00:40:02,870
M-M-Mr. Zhuo

530
00:40:03,640 --> 00:40:05,150
is not the enemy.

531
00:40:13,440 --> 00:40:15,230
After all these years,

532
00:40:17,010 --> 00:40:19,010
you still haven't grown up.

533
00:40:20,280 --> 00:40:23,180
You've really put in a lot of effort into

534
00:40:25,460 --> 00:40:28,390
building this illusion of the Demon Hunting Bureau.

535
00:40:28,880 --> 00:40:31,280
I just hope you don't forget

536
00:40:33,520 --> 00:40:36,340
how humans treat us.

537
00:40:47,030 --> 00:40:48,890
Luckily, you bought an umbrella.

538
00:40:54,470 --> 00:40:55,150
Listen.

539
00:40:58,590 --> 00:40:59,310
A demon.

540
00:41:08,470 --> 00:41:10,220
How could a normal clinic

541
00:41:10,550 --> 00:41:11,980
have a bunker?

542
00:41:19,830 --> 00:41:21,570
Such a strong smell of blood.

543
00:41:58,270 --> 00:41:59,930
The blood of Zhu Jian...

544
00:42:04,640 --> 00:42:05,620
Sir.

545
00:42:05,660 --> 00:42:07,240
Sir, save us...

546
00:42:07,360 --> 00:42:09,080
They captured us

547
00:42:09,100 --> 00:42:10,560
to drain our blood.

548
00:42:10,590 --> 00:42:11,960
But they won't let us die.

549
00:42:11,960 --> 00:42:13,920
Please save us.

550
00:42:13,940 --> 00:42:14,890
Sir..

551
00:42:15,570 --> 00:42:16,690
Save us.

552
00:42:16,720 --> 00:42:17,880
Save us!

553
00:42:17,900 --> 00:42:18,580
Sir!

554
00:42:18,610 --> 00:42:21,790
I don't want to stay here anymore.

555
00:42:21,810 --> 00:42:23,330
Save us.

556
00:42:23,360 --> 00:42:25,600
Save us!

557
00:42:25,650 --> 00:42:26,850
Sir!

558
00:42:27,560 --> 00:42:30,740
Please save us!

559
00:42:30,910 --> 00:42:32,550
Someone's coming.

560
00:42:33,220 --> 00:42:33,910
Save us!

561
00:42:33,910 --> 00:42:34,600
Let's go!

562
00:42:35,350 --> 00:42:36,390
Sir!

563
00:42:40,670 --> 00:42:41,970
It's been such a hard journey.

564
00:42:41,970 --> 00:42:43,430
I finally found the

565
00:42:43,430 --> 00:42:44,760
branch of the Ever-Burning Wood that he wants.

566
00:42:44,760 --> 00:42:45,730
It is said that

567
00:42:46,280 --> 00:42:48,360
this is the last piece of Ever-Burning Wood in the world.

568
00:42:48,360 --> 00:42:49,680
Watch it carefully.

569
00:42:55,070 --> 00:42:55,750
Who are you?

570
00:43:19,490 --> 00:43:20,590
Are you crazy?

571
00:43:21,170 --> 00:43:22,370
Why did you kill them?

572
00:43:39,320 --> 00:43:40,550
Come with me.

573
00:43:41,980 --> 00:43:43,780
I'll take you to the Wilderness.

574
00:43:55,870 --> 00:43:58,340
â™«A thought in the vicissitudes of timeâ™«

575
00:43:58,410 --> 00:44:02,470
â™«Wait until regrets blow all over the desolate worldâ™«

576
00:44:02,670 --> 00:44:04,830
â™«The inscription is difficult to readâ™«

577

578

â™«Turning the world upside downâ™«

579
00:44:11,480 --> 00:44:16,130
â™«Can't get the broken yesterday backâ™«

580
00:44:16,580 --> 00:44:22,190
â™«How to turn back time?â™«

581
00:44:22,280 --> 00:44:25,150
â™«I'm willing to break through the cliffâ™«

582
00:44:25,210 --> 00:44:28,520
â™«Turn into a white horseâ™«

583
00:44:28,900 --> 00:44:31,590
â™«Crush all the strugglesâ™«

584
00:44:31,850 --> 00:44:35,240
