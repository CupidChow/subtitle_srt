I'm sorry, but I'm not sure if I can get the money back.

3
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:10,000
I'm sorry, but I'm not sure if I can get the money back.

4
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:15,000
I'm sorry, but I'm not sure if I can get the money back.

5
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:20,000
I'm sorry, but I'm not sure if I can get the money back.

6
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:25,000
I'm sorry, but I'm not sure if I can get the money back.

7
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:30,000
I'm sorry, but I'm not sure if I can get the money back.

8
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:35,000
I'm sorry, but I'm not sure if I can get the money back.

9
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:40,000
I'm sorry, but I'm not sure if I can get the money back.

10
00:01:55,000 --> 00:02:00,000
I'm sorry, but I'm not sure if I can get the money back.

11
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:05,000
I'm sorry, but I'm not sure if I can get the money back.

12
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:10,000
I'm sorry, but I'm not sure if I can get the money back.

13
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:15,000
I'm sorry, but I'm not sure if I can get the money back.

14
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:20,000
I'm sorry, but I'm not sure if I can get the money back.

15
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:26,000
How many demons have died in this bloody body?

16
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:33,000
You're angry because you saw everything I had.

17
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,000
But you're still holding it in your hand.

18
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
That's right.

19
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:44,000
I have nothing.

20
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:48,000
I have nothing.

21
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:52,000
It's all your fault.

22
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,000
You killed so many people.

23
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:20,000
You actually killed those people who hurt the demons and killed me?

24
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:24,000
The ones who killed the demons in the dungeon.

25
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:32,000
They were the ones who came to the clinic to get the blood.

26
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,000
The one who came to the clinic to get the blood.

27
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:41,000
The one who came to the clinic to get the blood.

28
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Such instructions require顆擊礑身男

29
00:03:45,420 --> 00:03:47,480
with some blazing醜陋

30
00:03:47,480 --> 00:03:48,920
I help people

31
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,400
Cutest can haunt

32
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:54,260
Looks so hard

33
00:03:54,800 --> 00:04:01,960
Lee

34
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:05,940
Chaoyuan

35
00:04:05,940 --> 00:04:10,940
You first betrayed the promise of protecting the King.

36
00:04:11,940 --> 00:04:13,940
I never betrayed the promise.

37
00:04:15,940 --> 00:04:18,940
It's just that our way of protecting the King is different.

38
00:04:19,940 --> 00:04:23,940
You still don't understand.

39
00:04:24,940 --> 00:04:25,940
Chao Yuan Zhao,

40
00:04:27,940 --> 00:04:32,940
don't think that the name of the mortal is really human.

41
00:04:32,940 --> 00:04:39,940
You think they are friends, but do they really think you are the same kind of person?

42
00:04:42,940 --> 00:04:47,940
Of course, Chao Yuan Zhao is my good friend.

43
00:04:50,940 --> 00:04:52,940
He is in the dance.

44
00:04:53,940 --> 00:04:55,940
Don't listen to him.

45
00:04:56,940 --> 00:05:01,940
I used to be his good friend.

46
00:05:03,940 --> 00:05:07,940
Chao Yuan Zhao,

47
00:05:09,940 --> 00:05:11,940
you are obviously incompetent.

48
00:05:12,940 --> 00:05:15,940
Why do you want to go with these bunch of rascals?

49
00:05:16,940 --> 00:05:18,940
You can't understand.

50
00:05:24,940 --> 00:05:26,940
This little white rabbit who loves to cry

51
00:05:27,940 --> 00:05:31,940
always has a dangerous life and we are reborn to death.

52
00:05:32,940 --> 00:05:34,940
The dragon has come back.

53
00:05:35,940 --> 00:05:37,940
I see the cold frost in the cold.

54
00:05:38,940 --> 00:05:41,940
But the inside of the white dragon is very cold.

55
00:05:42,940 --> 00:05:43,940
Thank you.

56
00:05:44,940 --> 00:05:46,940
Do you want to be my son?

57
00:05:49,940 --> 00:05:51,940
I don't want to praise him,

58
00:05:52,940 --> 00:05:54,940
but he is really like a man.

59
00:05:55,940 --> 00:05:57,940
He is kind and kind.

60
00:05:58,940 --> 00:06:01,940
He is not a criminal, but a weak man.

61
00:06:03,940 --> 00:06:05,940
As for Wen Xiao,

62
00:06:06,940 --> 00:06:08,940
everyone is a evil demon.

63
00:06:09,940 --> 00:06:11,940
He is afraid of me,

64
00:06:12,940 --> 00:06:13,940
hates me,

65
00:06:14,940 --> 00:06:16,940
and despises me.

66
00:06:19,940 --> 00:06:20,940
He is not jealous.

67
00:06:21,940 --> 00:06:24,940
He is just joking with you.

68
00:06:25,940 --> 00:06:26,940
Xiao Zhu,

69
00:06:27,940 --> 00:06:28,940
it's not that he is not.

70
00:06:29,940 --> 00:06:31,940
He is just being controlled by power.

71
00:06:32,940 --> 00:06:33,940
In theory,

72
00:06:35,940 --> 00:06:36,940
you haven't moved

73
00:06:38,940 --> 00:06:40,940
for so many years.

74
00:06:42,940 --> 00:06:43,940
Good.

75
00:06:45,940 --> 00:06:46,940
Very good.

76
00:06:51,940 --> 00:06:53,940
Since you care about them so much,

77
00:06:56,940 --> 00:06:58,940
I will let you watch

78
00:06:58,940 --> 00:07:02,940
your best friend die.

79
00:07:04,940 --> 00:07:06,940
You didn't say that I didn't have anything.

80
00:07:09,940 --> 00:07:10,940
Don't worry.

81
00:07:12,940 --> 00:07:13,940
Soon,

82
00:07:16,940 --> 00:07:17,940
you will be the same as me.

83
00:07:22,940 --> 00:07:23,940
Let him go.

84
00:07:23,940 --> 00:07:25,940
This is the first one.

85
00:07:29,940 --> 00:07:30,940
Xiao Zhu!

86
00:07:48,940 --> 00:07:49,940
What is this?

87
00:07:50,940 --> 00:07:51,940
Power.

88
00:07:52,940 --> 00:07:53,940
Power?

89
00:07:54,940 --> 00:07:55,940
Xiao Zhu,

90
00:07:55,940 --> 00:07:56,940
why do you have power?

91
00:07:59,940 --> 00:08:01,940
I underestimated you.

92
00:08:06,940 --> 00:08:07,940
But,

93
00:08:08,940 --> 00:08:11,940
this is a very good gift.

94
00:08:17,940 --> 00:08:18,940
Hold this.

95
00:08:18,940 --> 00:08:19,940
Pei Si Jing, Xiao Zhu,

96
00:08:19,940 --> 00:08:20,940
take Xiao Zhu away.

97
00:08:23,940 --> 00:08:24,940
Xiao Zhu.

98
00:08:29,940 --> 00:08:30,940
Xiao Zhu.

99
00:08:50,940 --> 00:08:51,940
Zhu Yichen.

100
00:08:51,940 --> 00:08:52,940
Xiao Zhu.

101
00:08:53,940 --> 00:08:54,940
Xiao Zhu.

102
00:08:57,940 --> 00:08:58,940
Xiao Zhu.

103
00:08:59,940 --> 00:09:00,940
Xiao Zhu.

104
00:09:04,940 --> 00:09:05,940
Did you find the key to the cave?

105
00:09:09,940 --> 00:09:10,940
Close your mouth.

106
00:09:17,940 --> 00:09:18,940
Pei Xiao.

107
00:09:22,940 --> 00:09:23,940
Zhao Yanzhou.

108
00:09:25,940 --> 00:09:27,940
It seems that the god of Bai Ze

109
00:09:27,940 --> 00:09:29,940
is really a good god to you.

110
00:09:31,940 --> 00:09:33,940
All the ancient goods,

111
00:09:34,940 --> 00:09:35,940
he has been used.

112
00:09:51,940 --> 00:09:53,940
The cave is very beautiful.

113
00:09:53,940 --> 00:09:54,940
It's a little bit more beautiful.

114
00:09:54,940 --> 00:09:55,940
It's a little bit more beautiful.

It's a little bit more beautiful.

It's a little bit more beautiful.

156
00:10:37,940 --> 00:10:47,940
If Baileau had Winged Cliffs,

the Sed Опity will have크� tackω đ intentions behind It?

158
00:11:06,940 --> 00:11:08,140
I'm sorry.

159
00:11:11,140 --> 00:11:12,940
The game hasn't ended yet.

160
00:11:13,940 --> 00:11:15,940
This time, it's the second choice.

161
00:11:17,540 --> 00:11:18,740
Zhao Yanzhou,

162
00:11:19,940 --> 00:11:21,740
who will you choose this time?

163
00:11:23,340 --> 00:11:24,740
No need to choose.

164
00:11:25,140 --> 00:11:26,340
I'll choose first.

165
00:11:27,140 --> 00:11:27,940
Monkey,

166
00:11:28,540 --> 00:11:30,340
I'll choose you to die.

167
00:11:33,940 --> 00:11:34,940
Wenxiu.

168
00:11:37,940 --> 00:11:38,740
Come on.

169
00:11:59,740 --> 00:12:00,540
Stay here.

170
00:12:00,740 --> 00:12:01,740
I'll help you.

171
00:12:36,940 --> 00:12:38,540
When I give you the umbrella,

172
00:12:39,940 --> 00:12:42,340
you'll finally know me.

173
00:12:44,540 --> 00:12:46,740
So we have no one in the world

174
00:12:47,140 --> 00:12:48,740
who never gives you the umbrella.

175
00:12:49,740 --> 00:12:50,740
Because the umbrella

176
00:12:51,740 --> 00:12:52,740
is the umbrella.

177
00:12:53,740 --> 00:12:55,340
You chose the umbrella.

178
00:12:56,340 --> 00:12:57,340
Li San

179
00:12:58,740 --> 00:13:00,540
chose it yourself.

180
00:13:06,940 --> 00:13:08,740
I'll choose you to die.

181
00:13:13,940 --> 00:13:15,740
I'll choose you to die.

182
00:13:16,740 --> 00:13:18,740
I'll choose you to die.

183
00:13:19,740 --> 00:13:21,740
I'll choose you to die.

184
00:13:22,740 --> 00:13:24,740
I'll choose you to die.

185
00:13:25,740 --> 00:13:27,740
I'll choose you to die.

186
00:13:36,940 --> 00:13:41,940
The End

187
00:13:45,940 --> 00:13:46,940
Li Qiyin.

188
00:13:51,940 --> 00:13:53,340
Zhao Yanzhou.

189
00:13:55,540 --> 00:13:58,740
You're willing to do this for them?

190
00:14:00,540 --> 00:14:01,340
Li Lun,

191
00:14:02,340 --> 00:14:04,940
you've been wanting me to fight for the spot, right?

192
00:14:05,940 --> 00:14:06,740
How is it?

193
00:14:07,540 --> 00:14:10,540
I'm doing well with my strength.

194
00:14:34,940 --> 00:14:35,940
Li Lun,

195
00:14:59,940 --> 00:15:00,940
stop!

196
00:15:03,940 --> 00:15:04,740
Wenxiu.

197
00:15:04,940 --> 00:15:05,940
Wenxiu.

198
00:15:35,940 --> 00:15:36,940
Wenxiu.

199
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:41,940
Li Lun.

200
00:15:42,940 --> 00:15:43,940
That's right.

201
00:15:45,940 --> 00:15:47,940
As you can see,

202
00:15:48,940 --> 00:15:50,940
I'm like this.

203
00:15:51,940 --> 00:15:53,940
I'm all like you.

204
00:15:53,940 --> 00:15:55,940
When the Burjimu

205
00:15:55,940 --> 00:15:57,940
has entered your body,

206
00:15:58,940 --> 00:16:01,940
the magic power of the Burjimu

207
00:16:01,940 --> 00:16:04,940
will be cast on me.

208
00:16:12,940 --> 00:16:13,940
I didn't know

209
00:16:15,940 --> 00:16:16,940
that

210
00:16:20,940 --> 00:16:21,940
the Burjimu

211
00:16:23,940 --> 00:16:27,940
was a magic that grew in the wild.

212
00:16:27,940 --> 00:16:29,940
It's a magic that

213
00:16:29,940 --> 00:16:32,940
makes the Burjimu immortal.

214
00:16:34,940 --> 00:16:36,940
The Burjimu's power

215
00:16:37,940 --> 00:16:39,940
is so powerful.

216
00:16:42,940 --> 00:16:44,940
You gave me the power

217
00:16:44,940 --> 00:16:46,940
to live forever.

218
00:16:50,940 --> 00:16:51,940
Li Lun,

219
00:16:54,940 --> 00:16:56,940
I'll never see you again.

220
00:16:58,940 --> 00:17:00,940
I'll never see you again.

221
00:17:02,940 --> 00:17:03,940
It's my fault.

222
00:17:07,940 --> 00:17:10,940
Li Lun has killed so many people in the human world.

223
00:17:10,940 --> 00:17:12,940
He's the most evil and the most cunning.

224
00:17:12,940 --> 00:17:14,940
He must be sealed by him.

225
00:17:15,940 --> 00:17:17,940
Back then, Li Lun and I

226
00:17:17,940 --> 00:17:20,940
used magic to bury him.

227
00:17:20,940 --> 00:17:23,940
We swear to protect him.

228
00:17:23,940 --> 00:17:25,940
He's more dangerous

229
00:17:25,940 --> 00:17:27,940
than anyone else.

230
00:17:27,940 --> 00:17:29,940
But it's a joke.

231
00:17:30,940 --> 00:17:32,940
As the one who has the power

232
00:17:32,940 --> 00:17:35,940
and the one who is afraid of getting burned by the Burjimu,

233
00:17:36,940 --> 00:17:38,940
he's also hurt by the Burjimu.

234
00:17:40,940 --> 00:17:42,940
Even if I don't punish Li Lun,

235
00:17:42,940 --> 00:17:44,940
he will be burned

236
00:17:44,940 --> 00:17:46,940
and destroyed

237
00:17:46,940 --> 00:17:48,940
by the Burjimu.

238
00:17:48,940 --> 00:17:51,940
So I asked him to be born.

239
00:17:51,940 --> 00:17:53,940
I'm not asking for anything

240
00:17:54,940 --> 00:17:56,940
but for good.

241
00:17:56,940 --> 00:17:58,940
Under the order of Bai Ze,

242
00:17:59,940 --> 00:18:02,940
the Burjimu will also be destroyed.

243
00:18:02,940 --> 00:18:04,940
He won't have to suffer

244
00:18:04,940 --> 00:18:06,940
the burning of Burjimu.

245
00:18:07,940 --> 00:18:09,940
He can live.

246
00:18:15,940 --> 00:18:17,940
It's ridiculous.

247
00:18:18,940 --> 00:18:20,940
I'm trapped in the Burjimu.

248
00:18:20,940 --> 00:18:22,940
I can't live.

249
00:18:22,940 --> 00:18:24,940
I'm too old to live.

250
00:18:24,940 --> 00:18:26,940
What's the point?

251
00:18:27,940 --> 00:18:29,940
I'd rather be burned by the Burjimu

252
00:18:31,940 --> 00:18:33,940
and be killed by the Burjimu.

253
00:18:37,940 --> 00:18:39,940
Bai Ze is a woman.

254
00:18:43,940 --> 00:18:45,940
It's all your fault.

255
00:18:45,940 --> 00:18:47,940
It's all your fault.

256
00:18:51,940 --> 00:18:53,940
I'm not happy.

257
00:18:56,940 --> 00:18:58,940
I'm not happy.

258
00:19:03,940 --> 00:19:05,940
You'll always kill him

259
00:19:07,940 --> 00:19:09,940
and Zhao Yanzhou.

260
00:19:20,940 --> 00:19:22,940
You win.

261
00:19:22,940 --> 00:19:24,940
There's nothing.

262
00:19:24,940 --> 00:19:26,940
There's no water.

263
00:19:28,940 --> 00:19:30,940
You can't repair the White Spirit.

264
00:19:32,940 --> 00:19:34,940
Everything is fate.

265
00:19:38,940 --> 00:19:40,940
Zhao Yuanzhao.

266
00:19:40,940 --> 00:19:44,940
When your energy is in this world,

267
00:19:46,940 --> 00:19:48,940
it's the world.

268
00:19:48,940 --> 00:19:52,940
It's the day of the people's lives.

269
00:19:55,940 --> 00:19:56,940
By then,

270
00:19:58,940 --> 00:20:00,940
I know your friends

271
00:20:01,940 --> 00:20:03,940
will choose to kill you

272
00:20:05,940 --> 00:20:08,940
or die with you.

273
00:20:18,940 --> 00:20:20,940
Let's go.

274
00:20:44,940 --> 00:20:46,940
Zhao Yuanzhao.

275
00:20:48,940 --> 00:20:50,940
Zhao Yuanzhao.

276
00:21:18,940 --> 00:21:20,940
Zhao Yuanzhao.

277
00:21:48,940 --> 00:22:18,940
La la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la

278
00:22:18,940 --> 00:22:22,500
a

279
00:22:24,500 --> 00:22:27,900
a

280
00:22:28,660 --> 00:22:30,020
Ruyo

281
00:22:30,700 --> 00:22:32,260
I

282
00:22:34,940 --> 00:22:37,060
I

283
00:22:40,900 --> 00:22:42,860
Come on

284
00:22:42,860 --> 00:22:43,860
to the palace.

285
00:22:46,460 --> 00:22:47,860
We'll talk about it later.

286
00:22:49,300 --> 00:22:51,100
Maybe we can find the way to purify the hair.

287
00:22:52,980 --> 00:22:54,740
Even if we can purify the hair,

288
00:22:56,500 --> 00:22:57,620
we can't say

289
00:22:58,100 --> 00:22:59,540
that time is up.

290
00:23:00,220 --> 00:23:02,220
But how do we fix Bai Zilin?

291
00:23:06,620 --> 00:23:08,220
Lord Xiaozhou, don't worry.

292
00:23:09,340 --> 00:23:10,380
In a month,

293
00:23:10,660 --> 00:23:12,540
if we still can't fix Bai Zilin,

294
00:23:13,260 --> 00:23:14,780
just kill me.

295
00:23:16,700 --> 00:23:18,660
I can use all my power

296
00:23:18,940 --> 00:23:21,180
to suppress Zhao Yanzhou's power

297
00:23:21,540 --> 00:23:22,780
in just one month.

298
00:23:25,940 --> 00:23:27,860
We fought together just now.

299
00:23:28,540 --> 00:23:30,180
We let others kill you.

300
00:23:30,700 --> 00:23:32,100
You really don't have a heart.

301
00:23:33,660 --> 00:23:35,340
I hope you don't have a heart, too.

302
00:23:36,700 --> 00:23:38,060
Because people with a heart

303
00:23:39,260 --> 00:23:40,500
suffer a lot.

304
00:23:43,580 --> 00:23:44,660
You don't have a heart.

305
00:23:45,460 --> 00:23:46,940
You don't have a hard life.

306
00:23:48,300 --> 00:23:49,340
The world is hard.

307
00:23:49,740 --> 00:23:50,860
It's hard to live.

308
00:23:51,620 --> 00:23:53,740
Since you were born here,

309
00:23:55,180 --> 00:23:56,580
you should live well.

310
00:23:59,620 --> 00:24:00,980
Xiaozhou is right.

311
00:24:02,460 --> 00:24:04,340
Don't always think about dying.

312
00:24:05,220 --> 00:24:07,100
And don't forget the contract between us.

313
00:24:07,660 --> 00:24:09,500
You still have to give me the power to cure you.

314
00:24:10,300 --> 00:24:12,140
Bai Zilin still hasn't repaired,

315
00:24:12,740 --> 00:24:14,500
and the Great黃 Sea is back to normal.

316
00:24:16,020 --> 00:24:18,820
Your father hasn't been returned home yet.

317
00:24:20,340 --> 00:24:21,820
It's not so heartless.

318
00:24:25,420 --> 00:24:26,540
Well, well, well.

319
00:24:29,220 --> 00:24:30,660
But we're still vulnerable.

320
00:24:32,900 --> 00:24:34,180
As if.

321
00:24:39,500 --> 00:24:40,500
Thank you.

322
00:24:41,500 --> 00:24:42,500
Why thank me?

323
00:24:43,500 --> 00:24:44,500
I'm thanking Lord Wenxiao.

324
00:24:45,500 --> 00:24:46,500
You...

325
00:25:10,500 --> 00:25:12,500
This is Mount Kunlun.

326
00:25:12,500 --> 00:25:13,500
You're a group of mortal.

327
00:25:13,500 --> 00:25:14,500
Why are you here?

328
00:25:15,500 --> 00:25:19,500
They all say that the demon and the petal are not suitable for each other.

329
00:25:19,500 --> 00:25:22,500
But this time, we're all here to fight.

330
00:25:24,500 --> 00:25:25,500
What do you want?

331
00:25:27,500 --> 00:25:29,500
Take Zhao Yuanzhou.

332
00:25:31,500 --> 00:25:32,500
Zhao Yuanzhou is not here.

333
00:25:33,500 --> 00:25:34,500
Who said I'm not here?

334
00:25:40,500 --> 00:25:43,500
Is this a big deal?

335
00:25:49,500 --> 00:25:50,500
Guards.

336
00:25:51,500 --> 00:25:52,500
Take Zhao Yuanzhou.

337
00:25:53,500 --> 00:25:54,500
Yes, my lord.

338
00:25:55,500 --> 00:25:58,500
I, Fan Ying, am very grateful to you.

339
00:25:59,500 --> 00:26:02,500
The relationship between Chunwu Camp and Ji Yaosu is not a relationship.

340
00:26:04,500 --> 00:26:08,500
Why don't we have a fair and fair discussion?

341
00:26:09,500 --> 00:26:11,500
I'll decide on the third party of the palace.

342
00:26:11,500 --> 00:26:15,500
The representative of Prime Minister, Mr. Pei Siqing.

343
00:26:22,500 --> 00:26:23,500
Sure.

344
00:26:29,500 --> 00:26:31,500
Then, Zhao Yuanzhou will be in charge of...

345
00:26:34,500 --> 00:26:35,500
Chunwu Camp.

346
00:26:40,500 --> 00:26:41,500
Mr. Pei.

347
00:26:42,500 --> 00:26:43,500
It's okay.

348
00:26:43,500 --> 00:26:50,500
I was thinking about whether it's the old house of Ji Yaosu or the old house of Chunwu Camp.

349
00:26:50,500 --> 00:26:54,500
Mr. Pei, listen to me.

350
00:26:56,500 --> 00:26:57,500
Are you crazy?

351
00:26:59,500 --> 00:27:00,500
Don't worry.

352
00:27:09,500 --> 00:27:10,500
Don't be mad.

353
00:27:12,500 --> 00:27:13,500
Don't be mad.

354
00:27:26,500 --> 00:27:27,500
This is a shame.

355
00:27:31,500 --> 00:27:34,500
Jiu, you've grown up.

356
00:27:34,500 --> 00:27:37,500
Dad shouldn't have kept you from many things.

357
00:27:37,500 --> 00:27:42,500
When you come back to Tianzhu, I'll take you to see your mother.

358
00:27:42,500 --> 00:27:44,500
I'll tell you everything.

359
00:27:54,500 --> 00:27:58,500
Child, there are 3,000 food items in the world.

360
00:27:58,500 --> 00:28:00,500
30,000 precious stones.

361
00:28:01,500 --> 00:28:03,500
Which one is your way?

362
00:28:03,500 --> 00:28:05,500
Your own way.

363
00:28:09,500 --> 00:28:10,500
Yinglei.

364
00:28:16,500 --> 00:28:17,500
Lord Bu Wu.

365
00:28:18,500 --> 00:28:19,500
I've been in the middle of the mountain.

366
00:28:20,500 --> 00:28:22,500
I heard that you're pregnant.

367
00:28:22,500 --> 00:28:25,500
I came here to live with you.

368
00:28:26,500 --> 00:28:28,500
Grandpa, I've been thinking about it.

369
00:28:28,500 --> 00:28:29,500
I've been thinking about it.

370
00:28:33,500 --> 00:28:34,500
Thank you, Lord Bu Wu.

371
00:28:36,500 --> 00:28:38,500
Yinglei must have been through it.

372
00:28:38,500 --> 00:28:40,500
I'll try to be a good mountain god.

373
00:28:45,500 --> 00:28:48,500
Lord Bu Wu, you have something to ask.

374
00:28:48,500 --> 00:28:49,500
You say.

375
00:28:52,500 --> 00:28:54,500
Do you know how to purify water?

376
00:28:58,500 --> 00:28:59,500
I know.

377
00:29:05,500 --> 00:29:06,500
Look carefully.

378
00:29:07,500 --> 00:29:09,500
If there's any mistake, you'll be punished.

379
00:29:10,500 --> 00:29:11,500
Yes.

380
00:29:28,500 --> 00:29:30,500
Now, Zhao Yanzhou is going to be executed.

381
00:29:31,500 --> 00:29:32,500
It's the secret of the Prime Minister.

382
00:29:34,500 --> 00:29:35,500
We must get out of here immediately.

383
00:29:36,500 --> 00:29:37,500
Then let them get out.

384
00:29:38,500 --> 00:29:40,500
Anyway, they won't kill Zhao Yanzhou either.

385
00:29:40,500 --> 00:29:42,500
They'll be in trouble if he's killed.

386
00:29:43,500 --> 00:29:45,500
This is the reason why I came here.

387
00:29:46,500 --> 00:29:47,500
I'm sorry.

388
00:29:48,500 --> 00:29:49,500
I'm sorry.

389
00:29:50,500 --> 00:29:51,500
I'm sorry.

390
00:29:52,500 --> 00:29:53,500
I'm sorry.

391
00:29:54,500 --> 00:29:55,500
I'm sorry.

392
00:29:56,500 --> 00:29:57,500
I'm sorry.

393
00:29:59,500 --> 00:30:00,500
Prime Minister knows that

394
00:30:00,500 --> 00:30:02,500
only the Cloud Light Sword can kill him.

395
00:30:04,500 --> 00:30:06,500
He sent people to send spirits

396
00:30:07,500 --> 00:30:10,500
to take you out of Zhao Yanzhou.

397
00:30:12,500 --> 00:30:15,500
Xiaochuan, the big picture is the main thing.

398
00:30:15,500 --> 00:30:17,500
It's because the big picture is the main thing.

399
00:30:18,500 --> 00:30:20,500
He shouldn't have killed Zhao Yanzhou.

400
00:30:22,500 --> 00:30:25,500
At least, not now.

401
00:30:26,500 --> 00:30:27,500
Are you crazy?

402
00:30:29,500 --> 00:30:30,500
Don't worry.

403
00:30:39,500 --> 00:30:40,500
Xiaochuan,

404
00:30:41,500 --> 00:30:43,500
didn't you always want to kill Zhao Yanzhou

405
00:30:44,500 --> 00:30:46,500
and avenge your father?

406
00:30:52,500 --> 00:30:53,500
Zhao Yanzhou killed my father

407
00:30:54,500 --> 00:30:56,500
because he was in great pain.

408
00:30:57,500 --> 00:30:58,500
The real murderer

409
00:31:00,500 --> 00:31:02,500
was the power of the world.

410
00:31:04,500 --> 00:31:05,500
And Zhao Yanzhou

411
00:31:06,500 --> 00:31:07,500
was just that knife.

412
00:31:10,500 --> 00:31:11,500
These days,

413
00:31:11,500 --> 00:31:13,500
I've been with him all the way.

414
00:31:15,500 --> 00:31:16,500
I saw his other side.

415
00:31:18,500 --> 00:31:22,500
He was a kind and righteous person.

416
00:31:27,500 --> 00:31:28,500
So,

417
00:31:29,500 --> 00:31:30,500
you don't want to kill him?

418
00:31:31,500 --> 00:31:32,500
A knife

419
00:31:33,500 --> 00:31:34,500
is a good thing.

420
00:31:35,500 --> 00:31:36,500
It's not my fault.

421
00:31:39,500 --> 00:31:41,500
Now, the two realms are not clear.

422
00:31:41,500 --> 00:31:43,500
The big picture is in great danger.

423
00:31:44,500 --> 00:31:45,500
We must repair

424
00:31:45,500 --> 00:31:46,500
Bai Ze Ling as soon as possible.

425
00:31:47,500 --> 00:31:49,500
We need Zhao Yanzhou to help us.

426
00:31:51,500 --> 00:31:52,500
Bai Ze Ling is dead?

427
00:31:52,500 --> 00:31:53,500
Yes.

428
00:31:55,500 --> 00:31:56,500
He's going to kill Zhao Yanzhou.

429
00:32:00,500 --> 00:32:01,500
No wonder you don't dare to take risks.

430
00:32:02,500 --> 00:32:03,500
I dare not.

431
00:32:04,500 --> 00:32:05,500
Minister Fan,

432
00:32:05,500 --> 00:32:06,500
stop it.

433
00:32:06,500 --> 00:32:07,500
This is my order.

434
00:32:07,500 --> 00:32:08,500
Don't do it.

435
00:32:09,500 --> 00:32:10,500
Father, I don't want to talk about it.

436
00:32:11,500 --> 00:32:12,500
You don't want to talk about it, either?

437
00:32:13,500 --> 00:32:14,500
Xiao'er.

438
00:32:16,500 --> 00:32:17,500
Xiao'er, don't talk about me.

439
00:32:18,500 --> 00:32:19,500
I'm a new world.

440
00:32:19,500 --> 00:32:21,500
How can I keep the people safe

441
00:32:21,500 --> 00:32:22,500
and have no regrets?

442
00:32:22,500 --> 00:32:23,500
Okay.

443
00:32:23,500 --> 00:32:25,500
I'll go find Prime Minister myself.

444
00:32:25,500 --> 00:32:26,500
Wen Xia, Xiao'er.

445
00:32:26,500 --> 00:32:28,500
Xiao'er, stop him.

446
00:32:52,500 --> 00:32:53,500
Xiao'er.

447
00:32:54,500 --> 00:32:55,500
Xiao'er.

448
00:32:55,500 --> 00:32:56,500
The blood of the tribe.

449
00:32:57,500 --> 00:32:59,500
How many demons

450
00:33:00,500 --> 00:33:03,500
died in this blood-sucking iron cage?

451
00:33:52,500 --> 00:33:55,500
I didn't ask Lord Zhuo to let me be a high-ranking member.

452
00:33:55,500 --> 00:33:56,500
I'll do my best

453
00:33:56,500 --> 00:33:57,500
to get the gold and gold.

454
00:34:06,500 --> 00:34:09,500
Your uncle asked the court to rebuild Ji Yaosu.

455
00:34:10,500 --> 00:34:13,500
Although Prime Minister is very strong,

456
00:34:14,500 --> 00:34:16,500
he's always been a good warrior.

457
00:34:16,500 --> 00:34:18,500
A warrior is a good warrior.

458
00:34:18,500 --> 00:34:20,500
Fortunately, Prime Minister asked for the last day

459
00:34:20,500 --> 00:34:23,500
to fight for us.

460
00:34:49,500 --> 00:34:50,500
Who are you?

461
00:34:51,500 --> 00:34:52,500
Why are you here?

462
00:34:57,500 --> 00:34:59,500
Prime Minister, please forgive me.

463
00:35:00,500 --> 00:35:02,500
I'm going to die.

464
00:35:03,500 --> 00:35:05,500
I'm here to take you away.

465
00:35:06,500 --> 00:35:10,500
I just want to ask for something.

466
00:35:18,500 --> 00:35:20,500
I'm here to take you away.

467
00:35:20,500 --> 00:35:22,500
I'm here to take you away.

468
00:35:22,500 --> 00:35:24,500
I'm here to take you away.

469
00:35:24,500 --> 00:35:26,500
I'm here to take you away.

470
00:35:26,500 --> 00:35:28,500
I'm here to take you away.

471
00:35:28,500 --> 00:35:30,500
I'm here to take you away.

472
00:35:30,500 --> 00:35:32,500
I'm here to take you away.

473
00:35:32,500 --> 00:35:34,500
I'm here to take you away.

474
00:35:34,500 --> 00:35:36,500
I'm here to take you away.

475
00:35:36,500 --> 00:35:38,500
I'm here to take you away.

476
00:35:38,500 --> 00:35:40,500
I'm here to take you away.

477
00:35:40,500 --> 00:35:42,500
I'm here to take you away.

478
00:35:42,500 --> 00:35:44,500
I'm here to take you away.

479
00:35:44,500 --> 00:35:46,500
I'm here to take you away.

480
00:35:47,500 --> 00:35:50,500
Thank you for your cooperation.

481
00:35:50,500 --> 00:35:52,500
We can work together.

482
00:35:55,500 --> 00:35:57,500
Take them to the Sina Water Town.

483
00:35:57,500 --> 00:35:58,500
You can do it.

484
00:36:00,500 --> 00:36:02,500
You can't go early or late.

485
00:36:02,500 --> 00:36:04,500
You can do it in three or four days.

486
00:36:17,500 --> 00:36:19,500
What kind of transaction did Zhenmei use?

487
00:36:19,500 --> 00:36:22,500
She asked you to agree to be her internal partner.

488
00:36:25,500 --> 00:36:27,500
My brother.

489
00:36:28,500 --> 00:36:30,500
Your brother is not Yijing?

490
00:36:32,500 --> 00:36:34,500
Zhenmei just found me.

491
00:36:34,500 --> 00:36:37,500
She said she was just pretending.

492
00:36:37,500 --> 00:36:39,500
She said she was alive.

493
00:36:39,500 --> 00:36:41,500
If I still want to see her,

494
00:36:42,500 --> 00:36:44,500
I'll do it for her.

495
00:36:45,500 --> 00:36:47,500
But you know,

496
00:36:47,500 --> 00:36:50,500
your brother is dead.

497
00:37:02,500 --> 00:37:04,500
I know.

498
00:37:08,500 --> 00:37:10,500
I'm used to being confused and helpless.

499
00:37:10,500 --> 00:37:13,500
I want you to have a chance to see your brother again.

500
00:37:13,500 --> 00:37:15,500
Although he is just a stranger,

501
00:37:15,500 --> 00:37:17,500
you owe me a favor.

502
00:37:18,500 --> 00:37:19,500
Then, Mr. Pei,

503
00:37:19,500 --> 00:37:22,500
should you do me a favor?

504
00:37:27,500 --> 00:37:29,500
What do you want me to do for you?

505
00:37:30,500 --> 00:37:32,500
Keep pretending to be her internal partner.

506
00:37:32,500 --> 00:37:37,500
Let me reflect on the secret of the beast shadow.

507
00:37:38,500 --> 00:37:39,500
Okay.

508
00:37:40,500 --> 00:37:42,500
Do you want to tell Mr. Zhu and Wenxiao?

509
00:37:44,500 --> 00:37:45,500
No.

510
00:37:46,500 --> 00:37:48,500
You don't even believe in Wenxiao.

511
00:37:51,500 --> 00:37:54,500
I don't want her to be in danger.

512
00:37:54,500 --> 00:37:55,500
Moreover,

513
00:37:56,500 --> 00:37:58,500
Wenxiao and Xiao Zhuang are very angry.

514
00:37:59,500 --> 00:38:03,500
That's why our plan is more realistic.

515
00:38:07,500 --> 00:38:08,500
Your waist...

516
00:38:10,500 --> 00:38:12,500
hurts.

517
00:38:13,500 --> 00:38:15,500
I'll go get the medicine.

518
00:38:15,500 --> 00:38:16,500
Okay.

519
00:38:24,500 --> 00:38:26,500
Tomorrow is the blood moon.

520
00:38:26,500 --> 00:38:28,500
Will the formation of the formation

521
00:38:28,500 --> 00:38:30,500
be any different?

522
00:38:31,500 --> 00:38:33,500
I hope I was wrong.

523
00:38:35,500 --> 00:38:37,500
The formation needs two gods to help.

524
00:38:37,500 --> 00:38:39,500
I have a lot in my heart.

525
00:38:39,500 --> 00:38:41,500
Someone will break the enemy's foundation.

526
00:38:43,500 --> 00:38:45,500
Is it the god of the mountain?

527
00:38:50,500 --> 00:38:51,500
By the way, Mr. Pei,

528
00:38:51,500 --> 00:38:53,500
where are you going?

529
00:38:53,500 --> 00:38:56,500
The number of chasing me is very important.

530
00:38:56,500 --> 00:38:59,500
I'll go to the city center during the future security period.

531
00:39:00,500 --> 00:39:02,500
Is it Mr. Pei?

532
00:39:02,500 --> 00:39:04,500
You found me here?

533
00:39:04,500 --> 00:39:06,500
Who are you?

534
00:39:06,500 --> 00:39:08,500
Why are you here?

535
00:39:09,500 --> 00:39:11,500
Take Zhao Yanzhou down.

536
00:39:11,500 --> 00:39:12,500
Mr. Zhenmei,

537
00:39:12,500 --> 00:39:15,500
I'll take Mr. Fan Ying and you to the level of the official position.

538
00:39:16,500 --> 00:39:19,500
Why don't you give him the representative of Prime Minister

539
00:39:19,500 --> 00:39:22,500
and let him decide with you?

540
00:39:23,500 --> 00:39:25,500
Then, Zhao Yanzhou will take

541
00:39:25,500 --> 00:39:27,500
the position of the prime minister.

542
00:39:32,500 --> 00:39:33,500
Mr. Pei,

543
00:39:34,500 --> 00:39:35,500
it's time to finish.

544
00:39:42,500 --> 00:39:46,500
The Dragon is the Dragon of the Mountain.

545
00:39:58,500 --> 00:39:59,500
Thank you, Mr. Pei.

546
00:40:00,500 --> 00:40:02,500
I really don't know how to get rid of this

547
00:40:02,500 --> 00:40:05,500
in this old dragon filled with bamboo.

548
00:40:07,500 --> 00:40:10,500
There was a rumor that the monster caught by the monster

549
00:40:10,500 --> 00:40:13,500
was made by Mr. Shen.

550
00:40:15,500 --> 00:40:16,500
Eight years ago,

551
00:40:17,500 --> 00:40:19,500
me and Lillun were playing in the human world.

552
00:40:20,500 --> 00:40:22,500
We were hiding in the secret room.

553
00:40:23,500 --> 00:40:25,500
We found that

554
00:40:25,500 --> 00:40:27,500
the underground was hidden in a dungeon.

555
00:40:28,500 --> 00:40:30,500
The layout here is very similar to that of the real world.

556
00:40:32,500 --> 00:40:35,500
It should be the hand of Mr. Shen.

557
00:40:40,500 --> 00:40:42,500
The evidence is now confirmed.

558
00:40:42,500 --> 00:40:44,500
I'll give the report to Prime Minister.

559
00:40:44,500 --> 00:40:46,500
I'm here to rescue the guest.

560
00:40:53,500 --> 00:40:54,500
Don't pretend to be a ghost.

561
00:40:55,500 --> 00:40:57,500
I know who you are.

562
00:40:57,500 --> 00:41:00,500
Take off your ugly mask.

563
00:41:01,500 --> 00:41:03,500
Mr. Wen Zongyu.

564
00:41:05,500 --> 00:41:06,500
You found it?

565
00:41:07,500 --> 00:41:08,500
Wen Yi,

566
00:41:09,500 --> 00:41:11,500
you're in the private water town now.

567
00:41:12,500 --> 00:41:13,500
I'm in the middle of the rain.

568
00:41:14,500 --> 00:41:15,500
Mr. Luo, you're in trouble.

569
00:41:15,500 --> 00:41:16,500
When you left,

570
00:41:17,500 --> 00:41:19,500
Mr. Shen caught Xiao Zhuo.

571
00:41:25,500 --> 00:41:26,500
This is what you said?

572
00:41:28,500 --> 00:41:29,500
Eight years ago,

573
00:41:31,500 --> 00:41:33,500
you were the doctor in the mental hospital.

574
00:41:33,500 --> 00:41:34,500
You were the doctor.

575
00:41:36,500 --> 00:41:38,500
The secret dungeon under the mental hall.

576
00:41:39,500 --> 00:41:40,500
The dirty and dirty things

577
00:41:42,500 --> 00:41:43,500
that those people couldn't see.

578
00:41:43,500 --> 00:41:44,500
You did it, right?

579
00:42:04,500 --> 00:42:06,500
It seems that I underestimated you.

580
00:42:07,500 --> 00:42:08,500
Zhao Yanzhou.

581
00:42:11,500 --> 00:42:12,500
You caught so many demons.

582
00:42:13,500 --> 00:42:14,500
What do you want to do?

583
00:42:16,500 --> 00:42:17,500
Of course, I want to kill them.

584
00:42:18,500 --> 00:42:20,500
But my wish is not only for this.

585
00:42:21,500 --> 00:42:22,500
I hope that one day,

586
00:42:24,500 --> 00:42:26,500
I can kill all the demons in the world.

587
00:42:27,500 --> 00:42:28,500
Zhao Yanzhou,

588
00:42:29,500 --> 00:42:30,500
I hope that one day,

589
00:42:30,500 --> 00:42:32,500
I can kill all the demons in the world.

590
00:42:33,500 --> 00:42:34,500
Zhao Yanzhou,

591
00:42:35,500 --> 00:42:37,500
I've always wanted your burden.

592
00:42:38,500 --> 00:42:39,500
I didn't expect that you came here

593
00:42:39,500 --> 00:42:40,500
to deliver the demons yourself.

594
00:42:42,500 --> 00:42:43,500
You're a mortal.

595
00:42:45,500 --> 00:42:47,500
You dare to take my burden.

596
00:42:48,500 --> 00:42:49,500
You're not afraid of being killed.

597
00:42:50,500 --> 00:42:51,500
It's hard.

598
00:42:53,500 --> 00:42:54,500
But I heard that

599
00:42:54,500 --> 00:42:56,500
as long as the demon is closed,

600
00:42:57,500 --> 00:42:59,500
the burden will automatically be removed.

601
00:43:00,500 --> 00:43:01,500
You tuck your stomach.

602
00:43:02,500 --> 00:43:03,660
Temper dear,

603
00:43:04,500 --> 00:43:05,500
thick,

604
00:43:06,500 --> 00:43:07,500
and be because of the pain of death.

605
00:43:08,500 --> 00:43:09,500
Have you never noticed that?

606
00:43:16,500 --> 00:43:17,500
It's her.

607
00:43:21,500 --> 00:43:22,500
Who is it?

608
00:43:23,500 --> 00:43:24,500
Mr. Pei.

609
00:43:26,500 --> 00:43:27,500
So all your life

610
00:43:27,500 --> 00:43:31,760
it's been decided to be changed by brother

611
00:43:57,500 --> 00:43:59,500
I'm not sure if I can do it.

612
00:43:59,500 --> 00:44:01,500
I'm not sure if I can do it.

613
00:44:01,500 --> 00:44:03,500
I'm not sure if I can do it.

614
00:44:03,500 --> 00:44:05,500
I'm not sure if I can do it.

00:44:31,500 --> 00:44:33,500
I'm not sure if I can do it.

629
00:44:33,500 --> 00:44:35,500
I'm not sure if I can do it.

630
00:44:35,500 --> 00:44:37,500
I'm not sure if I can do it.

00:44:37,500 --> 00:44:39,500
I'm not sure if I can do it.
