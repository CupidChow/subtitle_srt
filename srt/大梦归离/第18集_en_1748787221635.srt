1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,520
At first, I lost serious sight of my camera.

2
00:00:07,020 --> 00:00:10,940
That's the scene.

3
00:00:10,940 --> 00:00:15,120
An时, Women and Children

4
00:00:16,200 --> 00:00:20,120
I lied to you, my poor friend.

5
00:00:20,120 --> 00:00:25,400
But Toka-P olive Fairy波锐, may God protect you.

6
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:27,400
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

7
00:00:27,400 --> 00:00:29,400
I'm sorry.

8
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:31,400
I'm sorry.

9
00:00:31,400 --> 00:00:33,400
I'm sorry.

10
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:35,400
I'm sorry.

11
00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:37,400
I'm sorry.

12
00:00:37,400 --> 00:00:39,400
I'm sorry.

13
00:00:39,400 --> 00:00:41,400
I'm sorry.

14
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:43,400
I'm sorry.

15
00:00:43,400 --> 00:00:45,400
I'm sorry.

16
00:00:45,400 --> 00:00:47,400
I'm sorry.

17
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:49,400
I'm sorry.

18
00:00:49,400 --> 00:00:51,400
I'm sorry.

19
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:53,400
I'm sorry.

20
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:55,400
I'm sorry.

21
00:00:55,400 --> 00:00:57,400
I'm sorry.

22
00:00:57,400 --> 00:00:59,400
I'm sorry.

23
00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:01,400
I'm sorry.

24
00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:03,400
I'm sorry.

25
00:01:03,400 --> 00:01:05,400
I'm sorry.

26
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:07,400
I'm sorry.

27
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:09,400
I'm sorry.

28
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:11,400
I'm sorry.

29
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:13,400
I'm sorry.

30
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:15,400
I'm sorry.

31
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:17,400
I'm sorry.

32
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:19,400
I'm sorry.

33
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:21,400
I'm sorry.

34
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:23,400
I'm sorry.

35
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:25,400
I'm sorry.

36
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:27,400
I'm sorry.

37
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:29,400
I'm sorry.

38
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:31,400
I'm sorry.

39
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:33,400
I'm sorry.

40
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:35,400
I'm sorry.

41
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:37,400
I'm sorry.

42
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:39,400
I'm sorry.

43
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:53,400
The Stone Palace

44
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:55,400
The Stone Palace

45
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:57,400
The Stone Palace

46
00:01:57,400 --> 00:01:59,400
The Stone Palace

47
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:01,400
The Stone Palace

48
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:03,400
The Stone Palace

49
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:05,400
The Stone Palace

50
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:07,400
This is where we saw it before it was destroyed.

51
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:11,400
Before it was destroyed, it was a big panic.

52
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:13,400
A big panic.

53
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:15,400
This is the birthplace.

54
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:17,400
This...

55
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:19,400
Big panic.

56
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:20,400
That's right.

57
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:23,400
That's why the demon is heading to the human world.

58
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:25,400
But as what Ranyi said,

59
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:27,400
this is our eternal hometown.

60
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:28,400
Xiao Zhige.

61
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:32,400
Where is Huaijiang Valley?

62
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:33,400
According to the mountain,

63
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:35,400
there is a water well.

64
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:39,400
Bai Ze is responsible for the water.

65
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:40,400
He is very gentle.

66
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:43,400
He must be crying again.

67
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:45,400
That's why he said,

68
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:47,400
if he finds the water well,

69
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:49,400
he can repair Bai Ze's order.

70
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:52,400
Then let's find the water well first.

71
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:53,400
And then find the tomb.

72
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:56,400
There is something

73
00:02:57,400 --> 00:02:58,400
that I might remind you of.

74
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:00,400
What?

75
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:03,400
Besides the water well,

76
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:06,400
Huaijiang Valley is still the place where the seal of the wheel is.

77
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:11,400
It is also where he lived since he was a child.

78
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:19,400
The seal of the wheel is still there.

79
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:22,400
The seal of the wheel is still there.

80
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:25,400
The seal of the wheel is still there.

81
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:28,400
The seal of the wheel is still there.

82
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:31,400
The seal of the wheel is still there.

83
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:34,400
The seal of the wheel is still there.

84
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:37,400
The seal of the wheel is still there.

85
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:40,400
The seal of the wheel is still there.

86
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:43,400
The seal of the wheel is still there.

87
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:46,400
The seal of the wheel is still there.

88
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:50,400
The seal of the wheel is still there.

89
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:53,400
The seal of the wheel is still there.

90
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:56,400
The seal of the wheel is still there.

91
00:03:57,400 --> 00:03:59,400
The seal of the wheel is still there.

92
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:02,400
I didn't expect that.

93
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:04,400
I can still use the seal of the wheel.

94
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:08,400
Da Yao, did you come to Huaijiang Valley before?

95
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:14,400
Da Yao,

96
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:16,400
did you just think of a place?

97
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:18,400
Did you think of a place?

98
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:20,400
Why did you bring us back?

99
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:48,400
It's been 12 months and 30 minutes.

100
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:52,400
I've been here for 6 months.

101
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:55,400
But you ruined my leg.

102
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:57,400
Your side has recovered.

103
00:04:58,400 --> 00:04:59,400
I totally forgot about it.

104
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:02,400
I'm sorry.

105
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:06,400
If you're old enough to try to figure out a way to pass my leg,

106
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:09,400
I'm a person who will always be around in the future.

107
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:12,400
I never thought of it.

108
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:14,400
I'm really sorry.

109
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:16,440
Olive

110
00:05:18,620 --> 00:05:20,000
No

111
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,360
G temples will be explore here

112
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:22,820
Andions

113
00:05:22,820 --> 00:05:26,240
Io water is preferred

114
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:29,040
Little bit of Io water

115
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:31,440
In my hand

116
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:36,080
Come if you want

117
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:39,080
Wen Xiao and I are together.

118
00:05:39,080 --> 00:05:42,080
You two come to find her.

119
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:14,080
This place is so creepy.

120
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:19,080
I'm sorry, I can't see through the magic eyes.

121
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:24,080
It's scary.

122
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:26,080
What's that sound?

123
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:30,080
Let's find Wen Xiao first.

124
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:32,080
Wen Xiao.

125
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:34,080
Wen Xiao.

126
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:36,080
You take this.

127
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:38,080
This water is definitely a problem.

128
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:40,080
It's not good.

129
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:02,080
Wen Xiao.

130
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:50,080
Wen Xiao.

131
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:56,080
Wen Xiao.

132
00:07:56,620 --> 00:07:59,320
onderes

133
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:12,440
Are you sure it'll end here, Little Rock?

134
00:08:12,440 --> 00:08:14,020
I'm sure...

135
00:08:14,020 --> 00:08:15,880
But Boss told me that

136
00:08:15,880 --> 00:08:18,600
you need to play your game with me.

137
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:21,140
Once you win, I'll let you go.

138
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:23,720
If I lose,

139
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:27,080
If you lose, I'll eat you up.

140
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:30,560
Fine.

141
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:32,720
What do you want to play?

142
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:36,560
I heard that lies are human nature.

143
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:40,440
I hope you can prove that you're wrong.

144
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:43,440
I can be the first.

145
00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:47,040
The rest, listen to Mr. Zhu.

146
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:49,880
Don't waste time.

147
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:51,880
If he doesn't let us go,

148
00:08:52,520 --> 00:08:54,320
I'll get rid of this tree.

149
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:56,440
It's useless.

150
00:08:57,320 --> 00:08:59,000
He's just a tree-tree.

151
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:01,000
Even if he kills it,

152
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:03,440
there will be more.

153
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:06,120
We'll be trapped in this environment.

154
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:07,360
What should we do?

155
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:10,160
Do we really have to play games with him?

156
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:12,200
This is absurd.

157
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:20,560
No.

158
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:23,640
Ask him.

159
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:26,120
Fine.

160
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:27,760
My problem is...

161
00:09:28,760 --> 00:09:31,040
Are you human or drugs?

162
00:09:33,520 --> 00:09:35,320
What's the mess?

163
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:36,720
Maybe I'm human.

164
00:09:38,260 --> 00:09:39,380
Very honest.

165
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:40,800
Done?

166
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:42,560
Next.

167
00:09:51,880 --> 00:09:55,060
Xia種B buys a paper.

168
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:01,040
harvest

169
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:01,920
Ask

170
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:02,780
What's the problem

171
00:10:03,160 --> 00:10:04,840
You are a person

172
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:06,160
Or a demon

173
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:09,560
The problem is quantities

174
00:10:09,560 --> 00:10:10,360
Do not care

175
00:10:10,780 --> 00:10:11,660
Reply

176
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:14,160
As I see

177
00:10:14,300 --> 00:10:15,420
I am a demon

178
00:10:17,260 --> 00:10:17,980
Very good

179
00:10:17,980 --> 00:10:19,980
Is it a problem?

180
00:10:19,980 --> 00:10:21,980
Yes.

181
00:10:21,980 --> 00:10:23,980
Human.

182
00:10:23,980 --> 00:10:24,980
Good.

183
00:10:24,980 --> 00:10:26,980
Last one.

184
00:10:26,980 --> 00:10:28,980
Really?

185
00:10:28,980 --> 00:10:30,980
Then 1 Rock Paper Scissors forios.

186
00:10:46,980 --> 00:10:48,980
What are you doing?

187
00:10:52,980 --> 00:10:54,980
Are you a human?

188
00:10:54,980 --> 00:10:56,480
Or a demon?

189
00:10:56,980 --> 00:11:00,980
I'm not good at solving this question.

190
00:11:01,980 --> 00:11:03,980
Let's change to an interesting question.

191
00:11:03,980 --> 00:11:05,980
This question is the most interesting.

192
00:11:05,980 --> 00:11:07,980
I don't want to change it.

193
00:11:07,980 --> 00:11:09,980
Answer it quickly.

194
00:11:09,980 --> 00:11:12,980
Are you a human or a demon?

195
00:11:20,980 --> 00:11:21,980
I...

196
00:11:23,980 --> 00:11:25,980
I'm a human.

197
00:11:27,980 --> 00:11:29,980
I'm a human.

198
00:11:37,980 --> 00:11:39,980
Someone is hiding it.

199
00:11:42,980 --> 00:11:44,980
Xiaozhi, save me!

200
00:11:52,980 --> 00:11:54,980
You seem to have something to say.

201
00:11:57,980 --> 00:12:00,980
I have something to ask you.

202
00:12:01,980 --> 00:12:03,980
Don't worry.

203
00:12:04,980 --> 00:12:06,980
I'm not A'Ni.

204
00:12:08,980 --> 00:12:11,980
I'm not worried about you trying to kill me.

205
00:12:13,980 --> 00:12:14,980
Then...

206
00:12:14,980 --> 00:12:16,980
You hate Zhao Yanzhou so much.

207
00:12:16,980 --> 00:12:19,980
You will be his target.

208
00:12:19,980 --> 00:12:22,980
You will arrest me alone.

209
00:12:22,980 --> 00:12:26,980
Obviously, you don't want to marry me.

210
00:12:28,980 --> 00:12:33,980
So I want to see what you want to play.

211
00:12:35,980 --> 00:12:37,980
Xiaozhi!

212
00:12:38,980 --> 00:12:39,980
Let him out.

213
00:12:39,980 --> 00:12:41,980
Otherwise, I'll kill you.

214
00:12:41,980 --> 00:12:43,980
You're lying.

215
00:12:43,980 --> 00:12:45,980
You should have been punished.

216
00:12:45,980 --> 00:12:46,980
I didn't.

217
00:12:46,980 --> 00:12:50,980
I didn't expect Xiao Bai Tu to hide it from us.

218
00:12:50,980 --> 00:12:52,980
You're a demon.

219
00:12:52,980 --> 00:12:53,980
Don't talk nonsense.

220
00:12:53,980 --> 00:12:55,980
Don't you have a golden head?

221
00:12:55,980 --> 00:12:56,980
If I were a demon,

222
00:12:56,980 --> 00:12:58,980
how could I hide it from him?

223
00:13:00,980 --> 00:13:03,980
The big yellow egg is not a demon.

224
00:13:03,980 --> 00:13:06,980
Maybe I can trick him.

225
00:13:11,980 --> 00:13:13,980
Mr. Zhu,

226
00:13:13,980 --> 00:13:16,980
when you were in the prison,

227
00:13:17,980 --> 00:13:19,980
you were suspecting me.

228
00:13:20,980 --> 00:13:22,980
You didn't see it.

229
00:13:22,980 --> 00:13:25,980
Mr. Zhu has always been a good person.

230
00:13:26,980 --> 00:13:29,980
Don't you have a soft tongue?

231
00:13:31,980 --> 00:13:32,980
You're soft.

232
00:13:36,980 --> 00:13:37,980
Xiaojiao,

233
00:13:37,980 --> 00:13:39,980
I'm asking you.

234
00:13:39,980 --> 00:13:42,980
Are you hiding anything from us?

235
00:13:47,980 --> 00:13:49,980
Xiao Shuo Ke,

236
00:13:52,980 --> 00:13:54,980
I'm not a demon.

237
00:14:12,980 --> 00:14:13,980
Okay.

238
00:14:17,980 --> 00:14:19,980
Mr. Zhu,

239
00:14:19,980 --> 00:14:21,980
you're really trusting me?

240
00:14:26,980 --> 00:14:28,980
I only trust my cloud world.

241
00:14:29,980 --> 00:14:31,980
One day

242
00:14:43,980 --> 00:14:48,980
Who of you accidentally hid a northeastern bird away

243
00:14:48,980 --> 00:14:54,980
inside the relic pit beside him?

244
00:15:24,980 --> 00:15:26,980
It seems that Xiao Xiao really is a demon.

245
00:15:26,980 --> 00:15:28,980
If it's a demon,

246
00:15:28,980 --> 00:15:30,980
the light will not reflect it.

247
00:15:31,980 --> 00:15:33,980
I'm really not a demon.

248
00:15:33,980 --> 00:15:35,980
But you're lying.

249
00:15:40,980 --> 00:15:42,980
Huai Jing is right.

250
00:15:42,980 --> 00:15:44,980
Zhang Yuzheng,

251
00:15:44,980 --> 00:15:45,980
stop messing around.

252
00:15:45,980 --> 00:15:47,980
Okay.

253
00:15:47,980 --> 00:15:49,980
I'm just watching everyone being so nervous.

254
00:15:49,980 --> 00:15:51,980
Just kidding.

255
00:15:51,980 --> 00:15:53,980
Of course I know that Xiao Bai Tu is not a demon.

256
00:15:53,980 --> 00:15:56,980
There is no demon that can hide the pain of the godess.

257
00:15:57,980 --> 00:15:59,980
Unless...

258
00:15:59,980 --> 00:16:01,980
Unless what?

259
00:16:04,980 --> 00:16:06,980
Nothing.

260
00:16:06,980 --> 00:16:08,980
Since there is nothing,

261
00:16:08,980 --> 00:16:10,980
then lying

262
00:16:10,980 --> 00:16:12,980
can only be this little demon.

263
00:16:14,980 --> 00:16:16,980
Xiao Jiu,

264
00:16:16,980 --> 00:16:18,980
step back.

265
00:16:23,980 --> 00:16:25,980
Xiao Jiu.

266
00:16:40,980 --> 00:16:42,980
Xiao Jiu,

267
00:16:42,980 --> 00:16:44,980
do you really believe me?

268
00:16:49,980 --> 00:16:51,980
You're right.

269
00:16:51,980 --> 00:16:53,980
I'm lying.

270
00:16:53,980 --> 00:16:55,980
But it's not our four.

271
00:16:55,980 --> 00:16:57,980
It's you.

272
00:17:06,980 --> 00:17:08,980
It's your turn.

273
00:17:08,980 --> 00:17:11,980
You are a demon.

274
00:17:12,980 --> 00:17:14,980
Of course I am a demon.

275
00:17:22,980 --> 00:17:24,980
You're cheating.

276
00:17:24,980 --> 00:17:26,980
You're lying.

277
00:17:26,980 --> 00:17:28,980
You're the one who's lying.

278
00:17:28,980 --> 00:17:30,980
Huai Shu is obviously a demon.

279
00:17:30,980 --> 00:17:32,980
You want to make us

280
00:17:32,980 --> 00:17:34,980
the softest demon?

281
00:17:36,980 --> 00:17:38,980
You said the softest demon.

282
00:17:38,980 --> 00:17:40,980
Isn't it Xiao Zhu?

283
00:17:46,980 --> 00:17:48,980
Go.

284
00:17:51,980 --> 00:17:53,980
Go.

285
00:18:13,980 --> 00:18:15,980
What were you thinking about?

286
00:18:16,980 --> 00:18:19,980
Your body is Huai Shu.

287
00:18:19,980 --> 00:18:21,980
Then,

288
00:18:21,980 --> 00:18:23,980
are you a demon or a demon?

289
00:18:28,980 --> 00:18:30,980
You asked me to ask.

290
00:18:30,980 --> 00:18:32,980
I asked you but you didn't answer.

291
00:18:32,980 --> 00:18:34,980
How?

292
00:18:34,980 --> 00:18:37,980
Are you afraid that I'll figure out your bottom line?

293
00:18:46,980 --> 00:18:49,980
Huai Shu is a natural demon.

294
00:18:49,980 --> 00:18:51,980
He's a demon.

295
00:18:51,980 --> 00:18:53,980
He's a demon.

296
00:18:53,980 --> 00:18:55,980
Huai Shu is a natural demon.

297
00:18:55,980 --> 00:18:57,980
He's a natural demon.

298
00:18:57,980 --> 00:18:59,980
He's a natural demon.

299
00:18:59,980 --> 00:19:01,980
Since ancient times,

300
00:19:01,980 --> 00:19:04,980
he has been called a demon.

301
00:19:08,980 --> 00:19:10,980
I see.

302
00:19:10,980 --> 00:19:14,980
No wonder I remember you as a demon.

303
00:19:14,980 --> 00:19:16,980
Come.

304
00:19:17,980 --> 00:19:19,980
What is this Bolangu

305
00:19:19,980 --> 00:19:22,980
for?

306
00:19:27,980 --> 00:19:29,980
It's for Zhao Yanzhou.

307
00:19:30,980 --> 00:19:32,980
You're right.

308
00:19:34,980 --> 00:19:36,980
You know

309
00:19:37,980 --> 00:19:40,980
that Zhao Yanzhou told you?

310
00:19:40,980 --> 00:19:43,980
I saw it in the world of the Japanese.

311
00:19:44,980 --> 00:19:46,980
I was afraid that

312
00:19:46,980 --> 00:19:50,140
someone else absorbed my blade of北旋

313
00:19:50,140 --> 00:19:53,180
and sleep before your heart has Serbia.

314
00:20:07,180 --> 00:20:08,980
Daughter,

315
00:20:08,980 --> 00:20:10,980
how much is it?

316
00:20:10,980 --> 00:20:12,980
$5.

317
00:20:12,980 --> 00:20:15,980
Good boy, I'll take you home.

318
00:20:15,980 --> 00:20:16,980
Okay?

319
00:20:20,980 --> 00:20:23,980
Little girl, do you like it?

320
00:20:24,980 --> 00:20:25,980
Take it.

321
00:20:25,980 --> 00:20:26,980
Thank you, brother.

322
00:20:26,980 --> 00:20:27,980
Don't cry.

323
00:20:27,980 --> 00:20:28,980
Thank you.

324
00:20:43,980 --> 00:20:46,980
What are you doing?

325
00:20:50,980 --> 00:20:53,980
I'm not good enough to take it.

326
00:20:56,980 --> 00:20:59,980
In the wilderness, we can look at it.

327
00:20:59,980 --> 00:21:02,980
We can do many things with a breath.

328
00:21:03,980 --> 00:21:07,980
But there are also illegal treasures in the world.

329
00:21:07,980 --> 00:21:11,980
Can you let others forget their tears?

330
00:21:11,980 --> 00:21:13,980
Is it funny?

331
00:21:13,980 --> 00:21:15,980
But what about him?

332
00:21:20,980 --> 00:21:23,980
Since you used to be friends,

333
00:21:23,980 --> 00:21:27,980
why did you become a brother?

334
00:21:29,980 --> 00:21:30,980
Friends?

335
00:21:35,980 --> 00:21:38,980
How to define a friend?

336
00:21:39,980 --> 00:21:41,980
You dare to cry?

337
00:21:46,980 --> 00:21:48,980
You dare to laugh?

338
00:21:54,980 --> 00:21:58,980
Friends are just words that you can't understand.

339
00:21:59,980 --> 00:22:04,980
You lie to the people and hurt them.

340
00:22:04,980 --> 00:22:09,980
You are the friend you call friends.

341
00:22:13,980 --> 00:22:15,980
You really think so?

342
00:22:16,980 --> 00:22:20,980
Why do you still keep this pineapple?

343
00:22:28,980 --> 00:22:30,980
Zhang Xiaozhou, your umbrella.

344
00:22:30,980 --> 00:22:31,980
Your umbrella.

345
00:22:32,980 --> 00:22:34,980
You want to protect me?

346
00:22:41,980 --> 00:22:44,980
What game is Lileng playing with you again?

347
00:22:47,980 --> 00:22:49,980
The game of my life.

348
00:22:55,980 --> 00:22:58,980
How far do you have between you and Lileng?

349
00:23:01,980 --> 00:23:05,980
You have given me so many questions.

350
00:23:08,980 --> 00:23:09,980
You ask.

351
00:23:11,980 --> 00:23:13,980
I have three questions.

352
00:23:14,980 --> 00:23:17,980
If you answer correctly, I will let you go.

353
00:23:19,980 --> 00:23:21,980
What if I answer wrong?

354
00:23:22,980 --> 00:23:28,980
If I answer wrong, I will die.

355
00:23:31,980 --> 00:23:33,980
This environment is not bad.

356
00:23:33,980 --> 00:23:35,980
Is there something wrong?

357
00:23:35,980 --> 00:23:36,980
You forgot.

358
00:23:36,980 --> 00:23:38,980
But Lileng wants you to go back.

359
00:23:40,980 --> 00:23:42,980
I'm afraid it's true.

360
00:24:01,980 --> 00:24:03,980
The world has changed so much.

361
00:24:03,980 --> 00:24:05,980
You are more than a big yellow rice.

362
00:24:05,980 --> 00:24:06,980
In the big yellow,

363
00:24:06,980 --> 00:24:09,980
a piece of wonton can be cut for more than 200 years.

364
00:24:09,980 --> 00:24:10,980
So,

365
00:24:11,980 --> 00:24:13,980
the big yellow is a little boring.

366
00:24:16,980 --> 00:24:18,980
Boss, how much is this?

367
00:24:18,980 --> 00:24:21,980
Sir, this umbrella is only five yuan.

368
00:24:24,980 --> 00:24:25,980
I'm sorry.

369
00:24:26,980 --> 00:24:27,980
I'm sorry.

370
00:24:27,980 --> 00:24:28,980
I'm sorry.

371
00:24:32,980 --> 00:24:34,980
The guide will give us five yuan.

372
00:24:35,980 --> 00:24:36,980
Just save it.

373
00:24:43,980 --> 00:24:44,980
It's raining.

374
00:24:46,980 --> 00:24:48,980
So, this is the umbrella.

375
00:24:50,980 --> 00:24:51,980
What's the use of it?

376
00:24:52,980 --> 00:24:53,980
It's raining again.

377
00:24:53,980 --> 00:24:54,980
Why is it raining?

378
00:24:54,980 --> 00:24:55,980
Why is it raining?

379
00:24:55,980 --> 00:24:57,980
It's windy and raining.

380
00:24:57,980 --> 00:24:58,980
The snow falls on the double-tip.

381
00:24:58,980 --> 00:25:01,980
Everything is natural in the world.

382
00:25:01,980 --> 00:25:04,980
I will never leave Lileng.

383
00:25:04,980 --> 00:25:06,980
Never leave.

384
00:25:07,980 --> 00:25:08,980
Okay.

385
00:25:24,980 --> 00:25:26,980
The first question.

386
00:25:28,980 --> 00:25:30,980
Is it good to be a person?

387
00:25:31,980 --> 00:25:32,980
Or good to be a drug?

388
00:25:33,980 --> 00:25:34,980
Drug?

389
00:25:35,980 --> 00:25:36,980
I don't want to.

390
00:25:36,980 --> 00:25:37,980
He's wrong.

391
00:25:55,980 --> 00:25:56,980
Be a person.

392
00:25:58,980 --> 00:25:59,980
Be a drug.

393
00:26:00,980 --> 00:26:01,980
It's good.

394
00:26:07,980 --> 00:26:08,980
Can only choose one.

395
00:26:11,980 --> 00:26:12,980
I don't need to choose.

396
00:26:14,980 --> 00:26:16,980
Because God has chosen for me.

397
00:26:19,980 --> 00:26:20,980
I...

398
00:26:20,980 --> 00:26:23,980
I can only be a person.

399
00:26:26,980 --> 00:26:28,980
Even if the drug is good,

400
00:26:30,980 --> 00:26:31,980
you don't need to envy it.

401
00:26:32,980 --> 00:26:33,980
You don't need to be a real person.

402
00:26:34,980 --> 00:26:36,980
The mountain doesn't let me go.

403
00:26:36,980 --> 00:26:38,980
The mountains don't let me go.

404
00:26:38,980 --> 00:26:40,980
Everything is good.

405
00:26:40,980 --> 00:26:42,980
Everything is good.

406
00:26:42,980 --> 00:26:44,980
Everyone is a drug.

407
00:26:44,980 --> 00:26:46,980
There is a good and bad thing.

408
00:26:46,980 --> 00:26:47,980
Everyone is a drug.

409
00:26:47,980 --> 00:26:49,980
There is a good and bad thing.

410
00:26:54,980 --> 00:26:57,980
The white god and the goddess are really good.

411
00:26:59,980 --> 00:27:01,980
Since the white god and the goddess think that

412
00:27:01,980 --> 00:27:02,980
everyone is good,

413
00:27:05,980 --> 00:27:07,980
the next question.

414
00:27:08,980 --> 00:27:10,980
Do you think it's worse for people?

415
00:27:12,980 --> 00:27:14,980
Or worse for demons?

416
00:27:17,980 --> 00:27:18,980
The demon is worse.

417
00:27:28,980 --> 00:27:30,980
Why is the demon so bad?

418
00:27:32,980 --> 00:27:34,980
My father is a good person.

419
00:27:35,980 --> 00:27:37,980
But he was killed by the demon.

420
00:27:41,980 --> 00:27:43,980
Although the demon is violent,

421
00:27:43,980 --> 00:27:45,980
it's not good enough.

422
00:27:46,980 --> 00:27:48,980
But the reason for this is

423
00:27:48,980 --> 00:27:51,980
because the demon has a love and hatred.

424
00:27:52,980 --> 00:27:56,980
It's not good enough to kill people.

425
00:28:02,980 --> 00:28:04,980
Are you really willing to go back to the Great Wall with me

426
00:28:04,980 --> 00:28:06,980
and take a rest?

427
00:28:07,980 --> 00:28:08,980
Yes.

428
00:28:11,980 --> 00:28:13,980
Because I don't want to be with anyone.

429
00:28:14,980 --> 00:28:17,980
Because I lost my family.

430
00:28:20,980 --> 00:28:22,980
Why don't you keep saying it?

431
00:28:40,980 --> 00:28:42,980
The demon's appearance is strange.

432
00:28:43,980 --> 00:28:46,980
The evil is on the road.

433
00:28:47,980 --> 00:28:49,980
The one who fights is A'Lu.

434
00:28:49,980 --> 00:28:51,980
The one who likes to be a lover is

435
00:28:52,980 --> 00:28:56,980
the evil of the white and the yellow god.

436
00:28:57,980 --> 00:29:02,980
And the person who signs the person will be the one who signs the face.

437
00:29:04,980 --> 00:29:07,980
If you ask who is more evil,

438
00:29:08,980 --> 00:29:09,980
then of course,

439
00:29:10,980 --> 00:29:12,980
the demon is more dangerous.

440
00:29:13,980 --> 00:29:14,980
It's more evil.

441
00:29:16,980 --> 00:29:20,980
But if you ask who is more dangerous,

442
00:29:21,980 --> 00:29:23,980
it's more difficult to put people in a position.

443
00:29:25,980 --> 00:29:26,980
Then it's...

444
00:29:29,980 --> 00:29:31,980
Then it's the next question.

445
00:29:40,980 --> 00:29:42,980
I really like your answer.

446
00:29:44,980 --> 00:29:46,980
The last question.

447
00:29:49,980 --> 00:29:55,980
Who is stronger between me and Zhao Yanzhou?

448
00:30:03,980 --> 00:30:06,980
How can you change the style of your question?

449
00:30:14,980 --> 00:30:16,980
Answer me.

450
00:30:22,980 --> 00:30:24,980
Zhao Yanzhou is stronger.

451
00:30:29,980 --> 00:30:34,980
Zhao Yanzhou is more powerful than you.

452
00:30:37,980 --> 00:30:39,980
He is not evil,

453
00:30:40,980 --> 00:30:42,980
not biased,

454
00:30:44,980 --> 00:30:46,980
but you are not true.

455
00:30:48,980 --> 00:30:50,980
You are also not hurt.

456
00:31:08,980 --> 00:31:10,980
You are so touching.

457
00:31:10,980 --> 00:31:12,980
You are talking for him.

458
00:31:13,980 --> 00:31:15,980
Don't you hate him?

459
00:31:16,980 --> 00:31:19,980
He killed your master.

460
00:31:20,980 --> 00:31:23,980
You should hate him like me.

461
00:31:26,980 --> 00:31:28,980
We should revenge.

462
00:31:29,980 --> 00:31:31,980
Isn't it?

463
00:31:36,980 --> 00:31:38,980
You said he is a man of the heart.

464
00:31:39,980 --> 00:31:42,980
He is just a man of the heart.

465
00:31:44,980 --> 00:31:47,980
He is more powerful than a man.

466
00:31:48,980 --> 00:31:52,980
He treats me and Zhao Waner like you.

467
00:31:54,980 --> 00:31:55,980
It's the same.

468
00:31:57,980 --> 00:31:58,980
One day,

469
00:32:00,980 --> 00:32:03,980
he will kill Zhao Waner like he did.

470
00:32:05,980 --> 00:32:07,980
He will kill you.

471
00:32:09,980 --> 00:32:10,980
So,

472
00:32:13,980 --> 00:32:14,980
now,

473
00:32:16,980 --> 00:32:18,980
you should bear the pain.

474
00:32:19,980 --> 00:32:20,980
Not me,

475
00:32:21,980 --> 00:32:23,980
not you.

476
00:32:26,980 --> 00:32:27,980
It should be him.

477
00:32:39,980 --> 00:32:40,980
It's him.

478
00:33:04,980 --> 00:33:05,980
Li Ruan,

479
00:33:06,980 --> 00:33:08,980
how many times have you been hurt?

480
00:33:10,980 --> 00:33:12,980
Why are you still not awake?

481
00:33:35,980 --> 00:33:38,980
Xiaojiu, Xiaojiu.

482
00:34:06,980 --> 00:34:08,980
What are you doing?

483
00:34:11,980 --> 00:34:13,980
He is not a joke.

484
00:34:17,980 --> 00:34:18,980
Wenjing.

485
00:34:18,980 --> 00:34:19,980
Xiaojiu.

486
00:34:36,980 --> 00:34:37,980
Xiaojiu, are you okay?

487
00:34:37,980 --> 00:34:38,980
I'm fine.

488
00:34:38,980 --> 00:34:40,980
What's going on?

489
00:35:06,980 --> 00:35:07,980
Wenxiao?

490
00:35:13,980 --> 00:35:14,980
Look.

491
00:35:18,980 --> 00:35:19,980
This iron cage

492
00:35:20,980 --> 00:35:21,980
limited my hair.

493
00:35:26,980 --> 00:35:28,980
What's wrong with this iron cage?

494
00:35:35,980 --> 00:35:36,980
This iron cage

495
00:35:37,980 --> 00:35:38,980
uses the blood of the pig.

496
00:35:39,980 --> 00:35:41,980
It's used to suppress the monster.

497
00:35:42,980 --> 00:35:44,980
The monster in this iron cage

498
00:35:45,980 --> 00:35:47,980
can't do anything.

499
00:35:48,980 --> 00:35:49,980
What's wrong with him?

500
00:35:55,980 --> 00:35:56,980
Go back.

501
00:36:06,980 --> 00:36:07,980
Go back.

502
00:36:20,980 --> 00:36:21,980
Zhao Yanzhou

503
00:36:23,980 --> 00:36:24,980
has been missing for a long time.

504
00:36:26,980 --> 00:36:27,980
Where is Wenxiao?

505
00:36:29,980 --> 00:36:31,980
The last level is not over.

506
00:36:32,980 --> 00:36:33,980
What's the rush?

507
00:36:34,980 --> 00:36:35,980
It's over.

508
00:36:37,980 --> 00:36:38,980
I'll let you pick him up.

509
00:36:43,980 --> 00:36:44,980
No.

510
00:36:45,980 --> 00:36:46,980
He's not Wenxiao.

511
00:37:03,980 --> 00:37:04,980
You still want to play?

512
00:37:05,980 --> 00:37:06,980
Yes.

513
00:37:08,980 --> 00:37:09,980
What do you want to play?

514
00:37:10,980 --> 00:37:11,980
Happy

515
00:37:13,980 --> 00:37:14,980
Erxuan Yi.

516
00:37:14,980 --> 00:37:15,980
Let him go.

517
00:37:17,980 --> 00:37:18,980
I'm going to let Huaiqing

518
00:37:18,980 --> 00:37:20,980
leave this kid for the first time.

519
00:37:21,980 --> 00:37:23,980
I didn't expect you to be so good at this.

520
00:37:24,980 --> 00:37:25,980
I'm afraid

521
00:37:26,980 --> 00:37:27,980
you'll be a bad guy.

522
00:37:28,980 --> 00:37:29,980
I'm afraid

523
00:37:30,980 --> 00:37:31,980
you'll be a bad guy.

524
00:37:32,980 --> 00:37:33,980
I'm afraid

525
00:37:34,980 --> 00:37:35,980
you'll be a bad guy.

526
00:37:36,980 --> 00:37:37,980
I'm afraid

527
00:37:38,980 --> 00:37:39,980
you'll be a bad guy.

528
00:37:40,980 --> 00:37:41,980
I'm afraid

529
00:37:42,980 --> 00:37:43,980
you'll be a bad guy.

530
00:37:44,980 --> 00:37:45,980
You didn't give him up.

531
00:37:47,980 --> 00:37:48,980
Xiaojiu is my friend.

532
00:37:49,980 --> 00:37:50,980
Even if I give up on myself,

533
00:37:52,980 --> 00:37:53,980
I won't give up on my friend.

534
00:37:55,980 --> 00:37:56,980
You won't give up on your friend?

535
00:38:00,980 --> 00:38:01,980
You're lying again.

536
00:38:04,980 --> 00:38:05,980
I'm going to

537
00:38:06,980 --> 00:38:07,980
use your life

538
00:38:08,980 --> 00:38:09,980
to get him back.

539
00:38:10,980 --> 00:38:11,980
Are you willing?

540
00:38:15,980 --> 00:38:16,980
I'm willing.

541
00:38:19,980 --> 00:38:20,980
Zhao Yuzheng.

542
00:38:21,980 --> 00:38:22,980
Don't listen to him.

543
00:38:24,980 --> 00:38:25,980
He's a liar.

544
00:38:26,980 --> 00:38:27,980
Xiaojiu.

545
00:38:30,980 --> 00:38:31,980
Zhao Yuzheng is a liar

546
00:38:31,980 --> 00:38:32,980
who's a liar.

547
00:38:37,980 --> 00:38:38,980
Happy Erxuan Yi.

548
00:38:40,980 --> 00:38:41,980
Listen to me.

549
00:38:41,980 --> 00:38:42,980
Choose one.

550
00:38:43,980 --> 00:38:44,980
Listen to me.

551
00:38:48,980 --> 00:38:49,980
Choose wine

552
00:38:52,980 --> 00:38:53,980
or drink.

553
00:38:55,980 --> 00:38:56,980
What do you choose?

554
00:39:00,980 --> 00:39:01,980
Choose one who's hurt.

555
00:39:04,980 --> 00:39:05,980
Choose one who's dead.

556
00:39:11,980 --> 00:39:12,980
Choose one who's hurt.

557
00:39:14,980 --> 00:39:15,980
Choose one who's dead.

558
00:39:17,980 --> 00:39:18,980
Choose one who's hurt.

559
00:39:19,980 --> 00:39:20,980
Choose one who's dead.

560
00:39:21,980 --> 00:39:22,980
Choose one who's hurt.

561
00:39:24,980 --> 00:39:25,980
Choose one who's hurt.

562
00:39:26,980 --> 00:39:27,980
Choose one who's dead.

563
00:39:28,980 --> 00:39:29,980
Choose one who's hurt.

564
00:39:30,980 --> 00:39:31,980
Choose one who's hurt.

565
00:39:32,980 --> 00:39:33,980
Choose one who's hurt.

566
00:39:34,980 --> 00:39:35,980
Choose one who's hurt.

567
00:39:36,980 --> 00:39:37,980
Choose one who's hurt.

568
00:39:38,980 --> 00:39:39,980
Choose one who's hurt.

569
00:39:39,980 --> 00:39:40,980
Choose one who's hurt.

570
00:39:48,980 --> 00:39:49,980
It's hard to choose.

571
00:39:51,980 --> 00:39:52,980
Wine is your friend.

572
00:39:54,980 --> 00:39:55,980
But Zhou Yichen

573
00:39:57,980 --> 00:39:58,980
is your enemy.

574
00:40:04,980 --> 00:40:05,980
Uncle Xiao.

575
00:40:05,980 --> 00:40:06,980
Uncle Xiao.

576
00:40:06,980 --> 00:40:07,980
Uncle Xiao.

577
00:40:08,980 --> 00:40:09,980
Uncle Xiao.

578
00:40:18,980 --> 00:40:19,980
So many years have passed.

579
00:40:21,980 --> 00:40:23,980
You still don't have a father.

580
00:40:25,980 --> 00:40:26,980
This is a special environment

581
00:40:26,980 --> 00:40:27,980
to be in Janssen.

582
00:40:30,980 --> 00:40:31,980
It's a good place to be.

583
00:40:33,980 --> 00:40:35,980
I just hope you don't forget.

584
00:40:37,980 --> 00:40:40,980
How did the mortal treat us?

585
00:40:51,980 --> 00:40:52,980
Fortunately, you bought the food.

586
00:40:58,980 --> 00:40:59,980
Listen.

587
00:41:02,980 --> 00:41:03,980
Shake.

588
00:41:08,980 --> 00:41:09,980
Uncle Xiao.

589
00:41:13,980 --> 00:41:14,980
A normal doctor.

590
00:41:15,980 --> 00:41:16,980
Why is there a treasure?

591
00:41:24,980 --> 00:41:25,980
Such a heavy blood.

592
00:41:37,980 --> 00:41:38,980
A heavy blood.

593
00:42:02,980 --> 00:42:03,980
Blood of the mortal.

594
00:42:08,980 --> 00:42:09,980
Brother.

595
00:42:09,980 --> 00:42:10,980
Brother, help us.

596
00:42:11,980 --> 00:42:12,980
They put our blood

597
00:42:13,980 --> 00:42:14,980
in our blood.

598
00:42:14,980 --> 00:42:15,980
But they didn't let us die.

599
00:42:16,980 --> 00:42:17,980
Please help us.

600
00:42:18,980 --> 00:42:19,980
Brother.

601
00:42:20,980 --> 00:42:21,980
Help us.

602
00:42:21,980 --> 00:42:22,980
Help us.

603
00:42:22,980 --> 00:42:23,980
Help us.

604
00:42:23,980 --> 00:42:24,980
We're in trouble.

605
00:42:25,980 --> 00:42:26,980
Help us.

606
00:42:27,980 --> 00:42:28,980
Help us.

607
00:42:28,980 --> 00:42:29,980
Help us.

608
00:42:29,980 --> 00:42:30,980
Help us.

609
00:42:30,980 --> 00:42:31,980
Help us.

610
00:42:31,980 --> 00:42:32,980
Help us.

611
00:42:32,980 --> 00:42:33,980
Brother.

612
00:42:33,980 --> 00:42:34,980
Help us.

613
00:42:34,980 --> 00:42:35,980
Brother.

614
00:42:35,980 --> 00:42:36,980
Someone's coming.

615
00:42:36,980 --> 00:42:37,980
Someone's coming.

616
00:42:37,980 --> 00:42:38,980
Someone's coming.

617
00:42:38,980 --> 00:42:39,980
Someone's coming.

618
00:42:39,980 --> 00:42:40,980
Someone's coming.

619
00:42:44,980 --> 00:42:45,980
The money is gone.

620
00:42:45,980 --> 00:42:46,980
Finally, we found

621
00:42:46,980 --> 00:42:48,980
the person who wanted the death penalty.

622
00:42:48,980 --> 00:42:49,980
Uncle Xiao.

623
00:42:50,980 --> 00:42:52,980
This is the last death penalty.

624
00:42:52,980 --> 00:42:53,980
Please keep an eye on him.

625
00:42:59,980 --> 00:43:00,980
Who's there?

626
00:43:07,980 --> 00:43:08,980
Who's there?

627
00:43:13,980 --> 00:43:14,980
Who's there?

628
00:43:23,980 --> 00:43:24,980
Are you crazy?

629
00:43:25,980 --> 00:43:26,980
Why did you kill him?

630
00:43:37,980 --> 00:43:38,980
I'm going with you.

631
00:43:39,980 --> 00:43:41,980
I'll take you to the Great Wall.

632
00:44:06,980 --> 00:44:07,980
Brother.

633
00:44:36,980 --> 00:44:37,980
Brother.

634
00:45:06,980 --> 00:45:07,980
Brother.

635
00:45:36,980 --> 00:45:37,980
Brother.

636
00:46:36,980 --> 00:46:37,980
Brother.

637
00:47:06,980 --> 00:47:07,980
Brother.
