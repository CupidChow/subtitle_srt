1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:12,700
Who the hell is talking guys...

2
00:00:12,700 --> 00:00:14,700
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

3
00:00:14,700 --> 00:00:16,700
I'm sorry.

4
00:00:16,700 --> 00:00:18,700
I'm sorry.

5
00:00:18,700 --> 00:00:20,700
I'm sorry.

6
00:00:20,700 --> 00:00:22,700
I'm sorry.

7
00:00:22,700 --> 00:00:24,700
I'm sorry.

8
00:00:24,700 --> 00:00:26,700
I'm sorry.

9
00:00:26,700 --> 00:00:28,700
I'm sorry.

10
00:00:28,700 --> 00:00:30,700
I'm sorry.

11
00:00:30,700 --> 00:00:32,700
I'm sorry.

12
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:34,700
I'm sorry.

13
00:00:34,700 --> 00:00:36,700
I'm sorry.

14
00:00:36,700 --> 00:00:38,700
I'm sorry.

15
00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:40,700
I'm sorry.

16
00:00:40,700 --> 00:00:42,700
I'm sorry.

17
00:00:42,700 --> 00:00:44,700
I'm sorry.

18
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:46,700
I'm sorry.

19
00:00:46,700 --> 00:00:48,700
I'm sorry.

20
00:00:48,700 --> 00:00:50,700
I'm sorry.

21
00:00:50,700 --> 00:00:52,700
I'm sorry.

22
00:00:52,700 --> 00:00:54,700
I'm sorry.

23
00:00:54,700 --> 00:00:56,700
I'm sorry.

24
00:00:56,700 --> 00:00:58,700
I'm sorry.

25
00:00:58,700 --> 00:01:00,700
I'm sorry.

26
00:01:00,700 --> 00:01:02,700
I'm sorry.

27
00:01:02,700 --> 00:01:04,700
I'm sorry.

28
00:01:04,700 --> 00:01:06,700
I'm sorry.

29
00:01:06,700 --> 00:01:08,700
I'm sorry.

30
00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:10,700
I'm sorry.

31
00:01:10,700 --> 00:01:12,700
I'm sorry.

32
00:01:12,700 --> 00:01:14,700
I'm sorry.

33
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:16,700
I'm sorry.

34
00:01:16,700 --> 00:01:18,700
I'm sorry.

35
00:01:18,700 --> 00:01:20,700
I'm sorry.

36
00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:22,700
I'm sorry.

37
00:01:22,700 --> 00:01:24,700
I'm sorry.

38
00:01:24,700 --> 00:01:26,700
I'm sorry.

39
00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:28,700
I'm sorry.

40
00:01:28,700 --> 00:01:30,700
I'm sorry.

41
00:01:30,700 --> 00:01:32,700
I'm sorry.

42
00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:34,700
I'm sorry.

43
00:01:34,700 --> 00:01:36,700
I'm sorry.

44
00:01:36,700 --> 00:01:38,700
I'm sorry.

45
00:02:06,700 --> 00:02:08,700
How can you be Devi's kind?

46
00:02:10,700 --> 00:02:12,700
I have multiple good fortune words.

47
00:02:14,700 --> 00:02:15,340
Calm down,

48
00:02:16,700 --> 00:02:18,700
I'll read them to you.

49
00:02:18,700 --> 00:02:20,700
I want to read them to you.

50
00:02:20,700 --> 00:02:22,700
If this mine,

51
00:02:22,700 --> 00:02:24,700
you just have to,

52
00:02:24,700 --> 00:02:28,300
or else I'll be busy and

53
00:02:28,700 --> 00:02:32,700
you just have toTHEN

54
00:02:32,700 --> 00:02:34,700
No way.

55
00:02:34,700 --> 00:02:36,700
I'm not strong enough.

56
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:41,700
I hate myself for not being strong enough.

57
00:02:46,700 --> 00:02:47,700
Master.

58
00:02:52,700 --> 00:02:53,700
Zhiyou.

59
00:03:01,700 --> 00:03:02,700
The one I love.

60
00:03:05,700 --> 00:03:08,700
They die in front of me one by one.

61
00:03:10,700 --> 00:03:17,700
And I can't do anything except watching.

62
00:03:34,700 --> 00:03:36,700
I'm not strong enough.

63
00:04:04,700 --> 00:04:06,700
I'm not strong enough.

64
00:04:34,700 --> 00:04:46,700
You're all fools.

65
00:04:47,700 --> 00:04:49,700
It's been ten thousand years.

66
00:04:50,700 --> 00:04:56,700
The god I left behind is a cruel man.

67
00:04:57,700 --> 00:05:02,700
I didn't expect to see such a ridiculous man.

68
00:05:02,700 --> 00:05:05,700
But I know you.

69
00:05:07,700 --> 00:05:18,700
You always make me feel sorry for the people I love.

70
00:05:33,700 --> 00:05:34,700
Open it.

71
00:05:35,700 --> 00:05:36,700
Open it.

72
00:05:37,700 --> 00:05:38,700
Open it.

73
00:05:38,700 --> 00:05:39,700
Open it.

74
00:05:39,700 --> 00:05:40,700
Calm down.

75
00:05:41,700 --> 00:06:00,700
My lord was here

76
00:06:02,700 --> 00:06:07,700
This must be a useful clue.

77
00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:09,700
I don't have any.

78
00:06:09,700 --> 00:06:11,700
I don't have any.

79
00:06:11,700 --> 00:06:13,700
I don't have any.

80
00:06:13,700 --> 00:06:15,700
I don't have any.

81
00:06:15,700 --> 00:06:19,700
I don't have any of these useless things.

82
00:06:19,700 --> 00:06:23,700
It was that year.

83
00:06:23,700 --> 00:06:27,700
His birthday.

84
00:06:27,700 --> 00:06:31,700
But I didn't know.

85
00:06:31,700 --> 00:06:33,700
I didn't prepare to leave.

86
00:06:34,700 --> 00:06:38,700
I was just outside the prison.

87
00:06:38,700 --> 00:06:41,700
I was holding a tiger's eye.

88
00:06:41,700 --> 00:06:44,700
I gave it to him.

89
00:06:47,700 --> 00:06:50,700
I didn't expect it to stay.

90
00:07:03,700 --> 00:07:06,700
I'm Wen Xiao.

91
00:07:08,700 --> 00:07:12,700
Then you should call me Aunt Wen.

92
00:07:16,700 --> 00:07:18,700
First time meeting.

93
00:07:18,700 --> 00:07:21,700
I heard that it's your birthday today.

94
00:07:21,700 --> 00:07:23,700
I'm not sure.

95
00:07:23,700 --> 00:07:25,700
I'm not sure.

96
00:07:25,700 --> 00:07:27,700
I'm not sure.

97
00:07:27,700 --> 00:07:29,700
I'm not sure.

98
00:07:29,700 --> 00:07:31,700
I'm not sure.

99
00:07:31,700 --> 00:07:33,700
It's your birthday.

100
00:07:33,700 --> 00:07:37,700
You're still celebrating with a smile.

101
00:07:37,700 --> 00:07:39,700
As an elder,

102
00:07:39,700 --> 00:07:43,700
I'll give you a small gift.

103
00:07:45,700 --> 00:07:47,700
Wild flowers?

104
00:07:47,700 --> 00:07:49,700
What?

105
00:07:49,700 --> 00:07:51,700
It's not a gift.

106
00:07:51,700 --> 00:07:55,700
It's a magic flower called the purple flower.

107
00:07:55,700 --> 00:07:58,700
It can make people forget.

108
00:07:59,700 --> 00:08:02,700
Purple flower?

109
00:08:02,700 --> 00:08:07,700
Can it really make people forget about the advantage and the trouble?

110
00:08:10,700 --> 00:08:12,700
Actually,

111
00:08:12,700 --> 00:08:14,700
it can be a person who has no worries.

112
00:08:14,700 --> 00:08:16,700
Only myself.

113
00:08:16,700 --> 00:08:18,700
The book says

114
00:08:18,700 --> 00:08:23,700
that the suffering of the world is only the selfishness.

115
00:08:29,700 --> 00:08:31,700
So,

116
00:08:31,700 --> 00:08:35,700
I hope you won't be sad and sad anymore.

117
00:08:58,700 --> 00:09:02,700
And I think you always wear blue clothes.

118
00:09:02,700 --> 00:09:06,700
The color of these flowers is just right for you.

119
00:09:06,700 --> 00:09:08,700
It's so nice.

120
00:09:09,700 --> 00:09:12,700
But are my clothes

121
00:09:14,700 --> 00:09:17,700
the white ones?

122
00:09:18,700 --> 00:09:21,700
They won't always be white.

123
00:09:22,700 --> 00:09:25,700
Just like the snow outside the window,

124
00:09:25,700 --> 00:09:29,700
it will always be white.

125
00:09:30,700 --> 00:09:33,700
When the flowers are slowly falling,

126
00:09:33,700 --> 00:09:36,700
they will become rainbow.

127
00:09:47,700 --> 00:09:49,700
I think what you said

128
00:09:51,700 --> 00:09:54,700
is all in it.

129
00:09:56,700 --> 00:09:59,700
You can understand it when you see it.

130
00:10:01,700 --> 00:10:03,700
Xiao Zhu,

131
00:10:05,700 --> 00:10:08,700
he is a fool.

132
00:10:08,700 --> 00:10:11,700
He is too silly.

133
00:10:11,700 --> 00:10:13,700
At that time, I told him

134
00:10:13,700 --> 00:10:15,700
just like the snow outside the window,

135
00:10:15,700 --> 00:10:17,700
the snow will always stop.

136
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:18,700
It will stop.

137
00:10:18,700 --> 00:10:19,700
It will stop.

138
00:10:19,700 --> 00:10:21,700
It will stop.

139
00:10:22,700 --> 00:10:25,700
The world will never be white.

140
00:10:25,700 --> 00:10:27,700
The snow will always be white.

141
00:10:27,700 --> 00:10:30,700
The snow will always be white.

142
00:10:32,700 --> 00:10:35,700
But now, you see it.

143
00:10:38,700 --> 00:10:40,700
You see it.

144
00:10:40,700 --> 00:10:43,700
You see it.

145
00:10:52,700 --> 00:10:55,700
You see it.

146
00:10:55,700 --> 00:10:56,700
Don't be afraid,

147
00:10:56,700 --> 00:10:59,700
I will show you how to do it.

148
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:02,700
I will show you how to do it.

149
00:11:02,700 --> 00:11:05,700
I will show you how to do it.

150
00:11:06,700 --> 00:11:09,700
I am a fool.

151
00:11:09,700 --> 00:11:12,700
I will show you how to do it.

152
00:11:12,700 --> 00:11:14,700
It's my mistake.

153
00:11:15,700 --> 00:11:18,700
I will show you how to do it.

154
00:11:18,700 --> 00:11:24,700
In my body, there is still a place of hope left.

155
00:11:24,700 --> 00:11:27,700
I can go through it with my own eyes.

156
00:11:27,700 --> 00:11:30,700
I know the future.

157
00:11:32,700 --> 00:11:35,700
If it can pass, I will save it.

158
00:11:36,700 --> 00:11:40,700
Are you willing to wait?

159
00:11:48,700 --> 00:11:51,700
I will wait for you.

160
00:12:03,700 --> 00:12:08,700
Dr. Ding, you have been thinking for seven days.

161
00:12:08,700 --> 00:12:11,700
Have you found the result?

162
00:12:19,700 --> 00:12:22,700
Why must it be me?

163
00:12:24,700 --> 00:12:29,700
Because you are the only one who can do it.

164
00:12:31,700 --> 00:12:33,700
But you will die.

165
00:12:40,700 --> 00:12:47,700
If I am the Emperor, I will be willing to die with you.

166
00:12:49,700 --> 00:12:56,700
Yinglong, you can bear to say that you are the head of the Dajiao Valley.

167
00:12:56,700 --> 00:13:02,700
You will give yourself up to fight with me.

168
00:13:02,700 --> 00:13:06,700
You will kill the evil.

169
00:13:12,700 --> 00:13:15,700
I can't do it.

170
00:13:18,700 --> 00:13:20,700
The Cloud Sword is the Valley.

171
00:13:20,700 --> 00:13:22,700
It is the left side.

172
00:13:22,700 --> 00:13:24,700
It is the right side.

173
00:13:24,700 --> 00:13:26,700
The Sword is the corner.

174
00:13:26,700 --> 00:13:29,700
It is the right side.

175
00:13:29,700 --> 00:13:32,700
It is the enemy for you.

176
00:13:33,700 --> 00:13:37,700
It can be destroyed by the Clouds.

177
00:13:37,700 --> 00:13:42,700
So the name of the sword is Cloud Light.

178
00:13:43,700 --> 00:13:46,700
But you are not the enemy.

179
00:13:49,700 --> 00:13:52,700
If the Sword is the right side,

180
00:13:52,700 --> 00:13:54,700
it must be me.

181
00:13:54,700 --> 00:13:57,700
The Emperor is so evil.

182
00:13:58,700 --> 00:14:06,700
I don't understand why it has to be you.

183
00:14:07,700 --> 00:14:13,700
After the war, the world collapsed.

184
00:14:13,700 --> 00:14:17,700
You see the dark night sky.

185
00:14:17,700 --> 00:14:20,700
You are not happy.

186
00:14:21,700 --> 00:14:28,700
Such a world is so sad.

187
00:14:29,700 --> 00:14:31,700
If I can't recover,

188
00:14:33,700 --> 00:14:38,700
the world will be destroyed.

189
00:14:38,700 --> 00:14:42,700
I should also contribute my last power.

190
00:14:44,700 --> 00:14:53,700
But how can I revive the Star Formation?

191
00:14:55,700 --> 00:14:58,700
I am the power of creation.

192
00:14:58,700 --> 00:15:03,700
I should be the Star Formation.

193
00:15:03,700 --> 00:15:06,700
This is my responsibility.

194
00:15:06,700 --> 00:15:09,700
And my glory.

195
00:15:10,700 --> 00:15:15,700
The Star Formation is the center of the star.

00:15:22,700 --> 00:15:25,700
I am the first one to do it.

197
00:15:29,700 --> 00:15:32,700
The sword is the guardian of the Clouds.

198
00:15:32,700 --> 00:15:34,700

199
00:15:34,700 --> 00:15:36,700

It is also the center of the star.

272
00:18:36,700 --> 00:18:38,700
The role is heart.

273
00:18:40,700 --> 00:18:42,700
They are only forcing themselves to do it.

274
00:18:42,700 --> 00:18:44,700
They are only forcing themselves to do it.

275
00:18:46,700 --> 00:18:48,700
It is still too cruel.

276
00:18:50,700 --> 00:18:52,700
I come by myself.

277
00:18:56,700 --> 00:19:01,700
I'm sorry, but I'm not sure if I can get the key.

278
00:19:01,700 --> 00:19:06,700
I'm sorry, but I'm not sure if I can get the key.

279
00:19:06,700 --> 00:19:11,700
I'm sorry, but I'm not sure if I can get the key.

280
00:19:11,700 --> 00:19:16,700
I'm sorry, but I'm not sure if I can get the key.

281
00:19:16,700 --> 00:19:21,700
I'm sorry, but I'm not sure if I can get the key.

282
00:19:21,700 --> 00:19:24,700
I'm sorry.

283
00:19:43,700 --> 00:19:48,700
I remember that this is my choice.

284
00:19:48,700 --> 00:19:50,700
It's not you.

285
00:19:52,700 --> 00:19:56,700
You don't have to say anything to blame and blame me.

286
00:20:18,700 --> 00:20:20,700
I'm sorry.

287
00:20:37,700 --> 00:20:42,700
I didn't expect you can pass my test.

288
00:20:49,700 --> 00:20:51,700
It's a test.

289
00:20:52,700 --> 00:20:57,700
Your choice is the same as mine.

290
00:20:57,700 --> 00:21:02,700
Otherwise, you'll stay here forever.

291
00:21:04,700 --> 00:21:06,700
Luckily, I chose the right one.

292
00:21:06,700 --> 00:21:10,700
Otherwise, I'll stay here forever and listen to you.

293
00:21:12,700 --> 00:21:14,700
What's more, it's not you.

294
00:21:15,700 --> 00:21:17,700
It's Yinglong.

295
00:21:17,700 --> 00:21:21,700
I chose to be strong and to be a star.

296
00:21:21,700 --> 00:21:24,700
It's my destiny.

297
00:21:25,700 --> 00:21:31,700
And to protect the Cangsheng and to meet the Cangsheng is his destiny.

298
00:21:32,700 --> 00:21:37,700
I'm willing to die with him.

299
00:21:37,700 --> 00:21:40,700
But I'm also very willing to die.

300
00:21:41,700 --> 00:21:43,700
But we're really like...

301
00:21:44,700 --> 00:21:47,700
I'm begging you to die.

302
00:21:48,700 --> 00:21:51,700
But I don't want to die for us.

303
00:21:51,700 --> 00:21:54,700
But the ice is still new.

304
00:21:54,700 --> 00:22:02,700
He used his unripe ice to break my stone.

305
00:22:02,700 --> 00:22:05,700
And on that dragon bone,

306
00:22:05,700 --> 00:22:10,700
it's in the spirit of the Ice Clan.

307
00:22:14,700 --> 00:22:20,700
The people of their clan are soft-hearted.

308
00:22:22,700 --> 00:22:25,700
But it's a pity.

309
00:22:26,700 --> 00:22:32,700
You should have seen the future of the Cangsheng.

310
00:22:32,700 --> 00:22:34,700
The future?

311
00:22:35,700 --> 00:22:37,700
Oh?

312
00:22:38,700 --> 00:22:42,700
It seems that the future that Zhuo Yichen saw.

313
00:22:42,700 --> 00:22:46,700
The future that you saw is the past.

314
00:22:51,700 --> 00:22:54,700
Although I didn't see the future,

315
00:22:55,700 --> 00:22:58,700
I can guess it.

316
00:22:59,700 --> 00:23:01,700
Although you're willing to die,

317
00:23:01,700 --> 00:23:04,700
you will win.

318
00:23:04,700 --> 00:23:08,700
Just like the fate of me and the ice.

319
00:23:08,700 --> 00:23:13,700
You and us are really like...

320
00:23:13,700 --> 00:23:15,700
I'm sorry.

321
00:23:27,700 --> 00:23:29,700
It's been a long time.

322
00:23:32,700 --> 00:23:34,700
It's been a long time.

323
00:23:43,700 --> 00:23:47,700
You can see the situation.

324
00:24:13,700 --> 00:24:15,700
I'm sorry.

325
00:24:15,700 --> 00:24:17,700
I'm sorry.

326
00:24:17,700 --> 00:24:19,700
I'm sorry.

327
00:24:19,700 --> 00:24:21,700
I'm sorry.

328
00:24:21,700 --> 00:24:23,700
I'm sorry.

329
00:24:23,700 --> 00:24:25,700
I'm sorry.

330
00:24:25,700 --> 00:24:27,700
I'm sorry.

331
00:24:27,700 --> 00:24:29,700
I'm sorry.

332
00:24:29,700 --> 00:24:31,700
I'm sorry.

333
00:24:31,700 --> 00:24:33,700
I'm sorry.

334
00:24:33,700 --> 00:24:35,700
I'm sorry.

335
00:24:35,700 --> 00:24:37,700
I'm sorry.

336
00:24:37,700 --> 00:24:39,700
I'm sorry.

337
00:24:39,700 --> 00:24:41,700
I'm sorry.

338
00:24:41,700 --> 00:24:43,700
I'm sorry.

339
00:24:43,700 --> 00:24:45,700
I'm sorry.

340
00:24:45,700 --> 00:24:47,700
I'm sorry.

341
00:24:47,700 --> 00:24:49,700
I'm sorry.

342
00:24:49,700 --> 00:24:51,700
I'm sorry.

343
00:24:51,700 --> 00:24:53,700
I'm sorry.

344
00:24:53,700 --> 00:24:55,700
I'm sorry.

345
00:24:55,700 --> 00:24:57,700
I'm sorry.

346
00:24:57,700 --> 00:24:59,700
I'm sorry.

347
00:24:59,700 --> 00:25:01,700
I'm sorry.

348
00:25:01,700 --> 00:25:03,700
I'm sorry.

349
00:25:03,700 --> 00:25:05,700
I'm sorry.

350
00:25:05,700 --> 00:25:07,700
I'm sorry.

351
00:25:07,700 --> 00:25:09,700
I'm sorry.

352
00:25:10,700 --> 00:25:12,700
I'm sorry.

353
00:25:14,700 --> 00:25:18,700
You can see the situation.

354
00:25:19,700 --> 00:25:21,700
I can see it.

355
00:25:26,700 --> 00:25:29,700
The dragon was not killed by the ice.

356
00:25:30,700 --> 00:25:32,700
It was killed by the moon.

357
00:25:33,700 --> 00:25:36,700
But there are people who say

358
00:25:37,700 --> 00:25:40,700
it's all a mystery.

359
00:25:40,700 --> 00:25:42,700
The sky is gone.

360
00:25:42,700 --> 00:25:44,700
The ice is killed.

361
00:25:44,700 --> 00:25:46,700
The dead are gone.

362
00:25:47,700 --> 00:25:48,700
The world

363
00:25:50,700 --> 00:25:53,700
has always been a lie.

364
00:25:53,700 --> 00:25:56,700
Just like mountains and rivers.

365
00:25:56,700 --> 00:25:58,700
The night is getting lower.

366
00:25:58,700 --> 00:26:01,700
People always say that monsters are heartless.

367
00:26:01,700 --> 00:26:03,700
But the dragon

368
00:26:03,700 --> 00:26:06,700
knows the great will of the world.

369
00:26:06,700 --> 00:26:09,700
No one should be called Ender.

370
00:26:09,700 --> 00:26:12,700
I just want to be a weak star.

371
00:26:12,700 --> 00:26:14,700
This is not a lie.

372
00:26:16,700 --> 00:26:18,700
So

373
00:26:20,700 --> 00:26:22,700
what should be done?

374
00:26:22,700 --> 00:26:24,700
What should be done?

375
00:26:25,700 --> 00:26:27,700
It's just a name.

376
00:26:27,700 --> 00:26:29,700
It's just a title.

377
00:26:29,700 --> 00:26:31,700
It's just a title.

378
00:26:35,700 --> 00:26:37,700
What do you want to be?

379
00:26:39,700 --> 00:26:41,700
What should you do?

380
00:26:43,700 --> 00:26:46,700
As a descendant of ice,

381
00:26:46,700 --> 00:26:49,700
you should be the best of the ice.

382
00:26:49,700 --> 00:26:52,700
You should be the best of the ice.

383
00:26:52,700 --> 00:26:54,700
The sky is gone.

384
00:26:54,700 --> 00:26:56,700
It's not a murder.

385
00:26:56,700 --> 00:26:58,700
It's a first.

386
00:26:58,700 --> 00:27:00,700
No matter what,

387
00:27:00,700 --> 00:27:02,700
you are a demon.

388
00:27:02,700 --> 00:27:04,700
It's not necessary to protect the heart.

389
00:27:04,700 --> 00:27:08,700
Only then can you be the best of the world.

390
00:27:08,700 --> 00:27:10,700
Go to the east of the world

391
00:27:10,700 --> 00:27:13,700
and take a dragon's head.

392
00:27:14,700 --> 00:27:15,700
Dragon's head?

393
00:27:15,700 --> 00:27:18,700
Dragon's head can restore everything

394
00:27:18,700 --> 00:27:20,700
and restore the light.

395
00:27:20,700 --> 00:27:22,700
I understand.

396
00:27:22,700 --> 00:27:24,700
Thank you, Lord Yinglong.

397
00:27:24,700 --> 00:27:29,700
But it's not easy to get a dragon's head.

398
00:27:30,700 --> 00:27:32,700
Don't worry.

399
00:27:34,700 --> 00:27:38,700
I have friends who will be the king.

400
00:27:41,700 --> 00:27:43,700
This time,

401
00:27:43,700 --> 00:27:45,700
I won't be the one to be the king.

402
00:27:45,700 --> 00:27:47,700
I will.

403
00:27:48,700 --> 00:27:50,700
Okay.

404
00:27:50,700 --> 00:27:52,700
The ice has said that

405
00:27:52,700 --> 00:27:56,700
the two most beautiful words in the world

406
00:27:56,700 --> 00:27:59,700
are called the golden hair

407
00:27:59,700 --> 00:28:02,700
and the nine-spot hair.

408
00:28:02,700 --> 00:28:05,700
A life can be as beautiful as a tree.

409
00:28:05,700 --> 00:28:08,700
Death is not a regret.

410
00:28:08,700 --> 00:28:11,700
I have been waiting

411
00:28:11,700 --> 00:28:14,700
for the old man to return.

412
00:28:14,700 --> 00:28:17,700
It's a pity.

413
00:28:20,700 --> 00:28:23,700
You have his spirit.

414
00:28:23,700 --> 00:28:25,700
I believe

415
00:28:25,700 --> 00:28:29,700
you are another kind of nine-spot hair.

416
00:28:29,700 --> 00:28:32,700
I can still witness

417
00:28:32,700 --> 00:28:34,700
the end of my life

418
00:28:34,700 --> 00:28:38,700
in your love for me.

419
00:28:39,700 --> 00:28:41,700
I hope that

420
00:28:41,700 --> 00:28:44,700
you can still be together

421
00:28:44,700 --> 00:28:46,700
in the sun and moon.

422
00:28:46,700 --> 00:28:49,700
We will be together in the sea of ​​land and sea of ​​land.

423
00:28:49,700 --> 00:28:51,700
We will be together in the sun and moon.

424
00:28:51,700 --> 00:28:53,700
I hope that

425
00:28:53,700 --> 00:28:55,700
we can be together again

426
00:28:55,700 --> 00:28:58,700
in the sun and moon.

427
00:29:01,700 --> 00:29:03,700
Actually,

428
00:29:03,700 --> 00:29:05,700
we are not four people.

429
00:29:06,700 --> 00:29:08,700
We are five people.

430
00:29:09,700 --> 00:29:11,700
Everything we do

431
00:29:12,700 --> 00:29:15,700
is to save the five people.

432
00:29:15,700 --> 00:29:17,700
I hope that

433
00:29:17,700 --> 00:29:19,700
all of your difficulties

434
00:29:19,700 --> 00:29:21,700
will be a dream

435
00:29:21,700 --> 00:29:25,700
in the end.

436
00:29:45,700 --> 00:29:47,700
I hope that

437
00:29:47,700 --> 00:29:50,700
you can still be together

438
00:29:50,700 --> 00:29:53,700
in the sun and moon.

439
00:29:54,700 --> 00:29:57,700
We will be together in the sun and moon.

440
00:29:57,700 --> 00:30:00,700
We will be together in the sun and moon.

441
00:30:00,700 --> 00:30:03,700
We will be together in the sun and moon.

442
00:30:03,700 --> 00:30:07,700
We will be together in the sun and moon.

443
00:30:08,700 --> 00:30:11,700
We will be together in the sun and moon.

444
00:30:12,700 --> 00:30:14,700
I hope that

445
00:30:14,700 --> 00:30:17,700
you can still be together

446
00:30:17,700 --> 00:30:20,700
in the sun and moon.

447
00:30:20,700 --> 00:30:23,700
We will be together in the sun and moon.

448
00:30:23,700 --> 00:30:26,700
We will be together in the sun and moon.

449
00:30:26,700 --> 00:30:29,700
We will be together in the sun and moon.

450
00:30:29,700 --> 00:30:32,700
We will be together in the sun and moon.

451
00:30:32,700 --> 00:30:35,700
We will be together in the sun and moon.

452
00:30:35,700 --> 00:30:38,700
We will be together in the sun and moon.

453
00:30:38,700 --> 00:30:41,700
We will be together in the sun and moon.

454
00:30:41,700 --> 00:30:44,700
We will be together in the sun and moon.

455
00:30:44,700 --> 00:30:47,700
We will be together in the sun and moon.

00:30:47,700 --> 00:30:50,700
We will be together in the sun and moon.

00:30:50,700 --> 00:30:53,700
We will be together in the sun and moon.

00:30:53,700 --> 00:30:56,700
We will be together in the sun and moon.

459
00:30:56,700 --> 00:30:59,700
We will be together in the sun and moon.

460
00:30:59,700 --> 00:31:02,700
We will be together in the sun and moon.

461
00:31:02,700 --> 00:31:05,700
We will be together in the sun and moon.

462
00:31:05,700 --> 00:31:10,700
We will be together in the sun and moon.

463
00:31:36,700 --> 00:31:39,700
We will be together in the sun and moon.

464
00:31:39,700 --> 00:31:42,700
We will be together in the sun and moon.

465
00:31:42,700 --> 00:31:45,700
We will be together in the sun and moon.

466
00:32:06,700 --> 00:32:07,700
Mine.

467
00:32:31,700 --> 00:32:32,700
You are fine.

468
00:32:34,700 --> 00:32:35,340
Now.

469
00:32:35,700 --> 00:32:37,700
It's all over.

470
00:32:46,700 --> 00:32:48,700
It's okay.

471
00:32:51,700 --> 00:32:53,700
I'll be back.

472
00:33:05,700 --> 00:33:35,700
Na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na

474

5

475
00:33:43,220 --> 00:33:46,600
3

476
00:33:46,600 --> 00:33:50,700
Wait to방

477
00:34:05,560 --> 00:34:06,480
Xiao Zhuang

478
00:34:09,020 --> 00:34:11,460
It's hard for you to become a soldier

479
00:34:11,860 --> 00:34:14,740
as an impostor

480
00:34:14,740 --> 00:34:18,740
I can't change anything.

481
00:34:18,740 --> 00:34:22,740
I only need to give you the last dragon bone.

482
00:34:22,740 --> 00:34:27,740
I wish you can draw out the internal pill and break the demon body.

483
00:34:27,740 --> 00:34:32,740
But from now on, you can only be a demon.

484
00:34:32,740 --> 00:34:34,740
You can't be a human.

485
00:34:34,740 --> 00:34:37,740
Have you thought about it?

486
00:34:44,740 --> 00:34:49,740
I've already experienced everything that I just experienced.

487
00:34:49,740 --> 00:34:52,740
I don't care about that anymore.

488
00:34:55,740 --> 00:35:00,740
But, Lord Yinglong,

489
00:35:00,740 --> 00:35:05,740
your last body is in this dragon bone.

490
00:35:05,740 --> 00:35:08,740
Give me the dragon bone.

491
00:35:08,740 --> 00:35:13,740
But you have to completely disappear.

492
00:35:39,740 --> 00:35:43,740
Do you think I'll be lamb for my sake?

493
00:35:43,740 --> 00:35:44,840
No, no,

494
00:35:44,840 --> 00:35:48,140
it's just getting better and better,

495
00:35:50,740 --> 00:35:53,740
I've already planned it.

496
00:35:53,740 --> 00:35:57,440
Let's go.

497
00:36:02,340 --> 00:36:03,740
Zi...

498
00:36:03,740 --> 00:36:10,360
It's just that that time Bismillors' became my Batman first.

499
00:36:11,500 --> 00:36:15,500
He really is a cruel man.

500
00:36:16,220 --> 00:36:21,880
We never expected worth ten thousand more years to be Locked in here

501
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:26,460
Cheers toarte this day

502
00:36:26,460 --> 00:36:29,860
that the girls will need second regard themselves.

503
00:36:29,860 --> 00:36:32,760
The child's direction deserves a second shave.

504
00:36:32,760 --> 00:36:34,320
Very good.

505
00:36:37,320 --> 00:36:39,460
The boy must be very happy.

506
00:36:40,160 --> 00:36:41,080
Sister...

507
00:36:52,460 --> 00:36:53,500
Are you being silly?

508
00:37:23,500 --> 00:37:25,500
Xiao Zhu.

509
00:37:26,500 --> 00:37:28,500
Xiao Zhu.

510
00:37:28,500 --> 00:37:30,500
I...

511
00:37:30,500 --> 00:37:32,500
I think I have it.

512
00:37:35,500 --> 00:37:37,500
That pill!

513
00:37:37,500 --> 00:37:39,500
I said I have that pill!

514
00:37:39,500 --> 00:37:41,500
Now it's done.

515
00:37:41,500 --> 00:37:43,500
I've completely become my best friend.

516
00:37:43,500 --> 00:37:45,500
I'm so close to it.

517
00:37:45,500 --> 00:37:48,500
Xiao Zhu, congratulations.

518
00:37:48,500 --> 00:37:50,500
You finally became a drug addict.

519
00:37:50,500 --> 00:37:52,500
I've become a drug addict.

520
00:37:52,500 --> 00:37:55,500
Then, as a new drug addict,

521
00:37:55,500 --> 00:37:58,500
what is this?

522
00:37:58,500 --> 00:38:00,500
The blood of the doctor.

523
00:38:00,500 --> 00:38:02,500
The doctor's blood.

524
00:38:02,500 --> 00:38:04,500
The poison of the IV.

525
00:38:04,500 --> 00:38:06,500
The IV.

526
00:38:06,500 --> 00:38:08,500
It should be the dragon.

527
00:38:08,500 --> 00:38:11,500
Wow, so handsome.

528
00:38:11,500 --> 00:38:13,500
I think it's the dragon.

529
00:38:15,500 --> 00:38:18,500
The dragon is definitely better than some monkey.

530
00:38:20,500 --> 00:38:22,500
Bai Yuan?

531
00:38:22,500 --> 00:38:24,500
You said it a thousand times.

532
00:38:24,500 --> 00:38:26,500
Bai Yuan?

533
00:38:26,500 --> 00:38:28,500
Monkey.

534
00:38:28,500 --> 00:38:30,500
I've been to the hospital.

535
00:38:30,500 --> 00:38:32,500
I said it's Bai Yuan.

536
00:38:32,500 --> 00:38:34,500
Go away.

537
00:38:34,500 --> 00:38:36,500
This is the dragon.

538
00:38:44,500 --> 00:38:46,500
Monkey.

539
00:38:46,500 --> 00:38:48,500
Monkey.

540
00:38:48,500 --> 00:38:50,500
Monkey.

541
00:39:00,500 --> 00:39:02,500
Thank you, Godmother.

542
00:39:02,500 --> 00:39:04,500
I've found Bai Ze Lin.

543
00:39:04,500 --> 00:39:06,500
I've recovered my life.

544
00:39:08,500 --> 00:39:10,500
Ying Lei said

545
00:39:10,500 --> 00:39:12,500
you are all Xiao Jiu's friends.

546
00:39:12,500 --> 00:39:14,500
Especially

547
00:39:14,500 --> 00:39:16,500
the most beloved Lord Zhuo Yi Chen.

548
00:39:16,500 --> 00:39:18,500
He is your closest friend.

549
00:39:18,500 --> 00:39:20,500
Thank you for taking care of him.

550
00:39:22,500 --> 00:39:24,500
I didn't take good care of him.

551
00:39:26,500 --> 00:39:28,500
Otherwise, I wouldn't have been able to get rid of him.

552
00:39:30,500 --> 00:39:32,500
So, Li Lun told us to go to the border of the Binyin Tribe.

553
00:39:32,500 --> 00:39:34,500
He didn't want us to find a way to repair the Clouds.

554
00:39:34,500 --> 00:39:36,500
So, Li Lun told us to go to the Binyin Tribe.

555
00:39:36,500 --> 00:39:38,500
He didn't want us to find a way to repair the Clouds.

556
00:39:38,500 --> 00:39:40,500
Yesterday, I've already put a special spice on him.

557
00:39:40,500 --> 00:39:42,500
Yesterday, I've already put a special spice on him.

558
00:39:42,500 --> 00:39:44,500
No matter where he is,

559
00:39:44,500 --> 00:39:46,500
I can smell the scent

560
00:39:46,500 --> 00:39:48,500
and find him out.

561
00:39:50,500 --> 00:39:52,500
Thank God, there is a good nose.

562
00:39:52,500 --> 00:39:54,500
It's Lord Shan Shan.

563
00:39:58,500 --> 00:40:00,500
Lord Zhuo is praising me.

564
00:40:00,500 --> 00:40:02,500
It's so hard to say.

565
00:40:06,500 --> 00:40:08,500
Lord Zhuo has gone to the Binyin Tribe.

566
00:40:08,500 --> 00:40:10,500
After he came out,

567
00:40:10,500 --> 00:40:12,500
Lord Zhuo's power has become stronger.

568
00:40:18,500 --> 00:40:20,500
But, Lord Shen Yu,

569
00:40:20,500 --> 00:40:22,500
the Binyin Tribe has been in the dark.

570
00:40:22,500 --> 00:40:24,500
It's been a long time since it's been eliminated.

571
00:40:24,500 --> 00:40:26,500
After the storm,

572
00:40:26,500 --> 00:40:28,500
it's been a long time since it's been eliminated.

573
00:40:28,500 --> 00:40:30,500
I don't know where it is.

574
00:40:30,500 --> 00:40:32,500
I know where the Princess of the Binyin Tribe is.

575
00:40:34,500 --> 00:40:36,500
The Princess of the Binyin Tribe

576
00:40:36,500 --> 00:40:38,500
was the one who violated the family and ordered the people to enter the Binyin Tribe.

577
00:40:38,500 --> 00:40:40,500
The Princess of the Binyin Tribe

578
00:40:40,500 --> 00:40:42,500
killed someone in the mortal world.

579
00:40:42,500 --> 00:40:44,500
My master asked her to be in the Binyin Tribe.

580
00:40:46,500 --> 00:40:48,500
The Princess of the Binyin Tribe

581
00:40:48,500 --> 00:40:50,500
was asked to be in the Binyin Tribe.

582
00:40:52,500 --> 00:40:54,500
I can solve the problem.

583
00:41:00,500 --> 00:41:02,500
Who is it?

584
00:41:08,500 --> 00:41:10,500
As I see it,

585
00:41:10,500 --> 00:41:12,500
it's a long time ago.

586
00:41:16,500 --> 00:41:18,500
So, the next step is

587
00:41:18,500 --> 00:41:20,500
to find the Dragon-Demon Tribe's Dragon-Way.

588
00:41:22,500 --> 00:41:24,500
You are in the dark

589
00:41:24,500 --> 00:41:26,500
and you look at the whole Binyin Tribe.

590
00:41:26,500 --> 00:41:28,500
You are so young and young.

591
00:41:28,500 --> 00:41:30,500
Can you keep looking at the death of the Binyin Tribe?

592
00:41:30,500 --> 00:41:31,620
So long.

593
00:41:31,760 --> 00:41:32,680
Should I still stay in Hubei?

594
00:41:33,120 --> 00:41:34,660
No arm is being pulled out.

595
00:41:35,560 --> 00:41:36,700
You're right.

596
00:41:37,300 --> 00:41:38,460
No Imam got there.

597
00:41:41,180 --> 00:41:42,040
Xiao Yue.

598
00:41:42,300 --> 00:41:43,220
Xiao Yue!

599
00:41:43,580 --> 00:41:44,700
Xiao Yue!

600
00:41:49,500 --> 00:41:50,880
Are you alright?

601
00:41:51,920 --> 00:41:52,960
Lay down.

602
00:41:56,160 --> 00:41:57,300
Xiao Yue,

603
00:41:57,300 --> 00:42:02,140
why does my heart flow like boiling tortillas

604
00:42:03,660 --> 00:42:06,420
everyday?

605
00:42:27,300 --> 00:42:29,420
khiaging

606
00:42:34,680 --> 00:42:35,900
are you waiting

607
00:42:44,700 --> 00:42:47,140
Aren't you afraid you will see Mrs.Lou Yi

608
00:42:57,300 --> 00:43:01,300
I was walking alone at night

609
00:43:01,300 --> 00:43:06,300
I thought there was no dark, no border

610
00:43:06,300 --> 00:43:08,300
No end

611
00:43:08,300 --> 00:43:12,300
But as long as the light of light shines

612
00:43:12,300 --> 00:43:14,300
A little light

613
00:43:14,300 --> 00:43:16,300
Even if it's weak

614
00:43:16,300 --> 00:43:19,300
You can also find the way out

615
00:43:19,300 --> 00:43:23,300
Then find more and more light

616
00:43:27,300 --> 00:43:30,300
The light of light

617
00:43:30,300 --> 00:43:33,300
The light of light

618
00:43:33,300 --> 00:43:36,300
The light of light

619
00:43:36,300 --> 00:43:39,300
The light of light

620
00:43:39,300 --> 00:43:42,300
You're awake

621
00:43:42,300 --> 00:43:45,300
The light of light

622
00:43:45,300 --> 00:43:48,300
The light of light

623
00:43:48,300 --> 00:43:53,300
I have long left that darkness

624
00:43:53,300 --> 00:43:58,300
The light of light

625
00:43:58,300 --> 00:44:01,300
The light of light

626
00:44:01,300 --> 00:44:05,300
The light of light

627
00:44:05,300 --> 00:44:08,300
The light of light

628
00:44:08,300 --> 00:44:11,300
This is the raincoat of the shelter

629
00:44:11,300 --> 00:44:13,300
It can be passed down

630
00:44:13,300 --> 00:44:16,300
What's the situation to avoid it

631
00:44:23,300 --> 00:44:29,300
It started to rain

632
00:44:29,300 --> 00:44:34,300
The light of light

633
00:44:34,300 --> 00:44:39,300
The light of light

634
00:44:39,300 --> 00:44:42,300
The light of light

635
00:44:42,300 --> 00:44:47,300
The light of light

636
00:44:47,300 --> 00:44:49,300
I'm sorry, Miss.

637
00:44:49,300 --> 00:44:51,300
I didn't hurt you.

638
00:45:18,300 --> 00:45:20,300
I'm sorry, Miss.

639
00:45:20,300 --> 00:45:22,300
I'm sorry, Miss.

640
00:45:22,300 --> 00:45:24,300
I'm sorry, Miss.

641
00:45:24,300 --> 00:45:26,300
I'm sorry, Miss.

642
00:45:26,300 --> 00:45:28,300
I'm sorry, Miss.

643
00:45:28,300 --> 00:45:30,300
I'm sorry, Miss.

644
00:45:30,300 --> 00:45:32,300
I'm sorry, Miss.

645
00:45:32,300 --> 00:45:34,300
I'm sorry, Miss.

646
00:45:34,300 --> 00:45:36,300
I'm sorry, Miss.

647
00:45:36,300 --> 00:45:38,300
I'm sorry, Miss.

648
00:45:38,300 --> 00:45:40,300
I'm sorry, Miss.

649
00:45:40,300 --> 00:45:42,300
I'm sorry, Miss.

650
00:45:42,300 --> 00:45:44,300
I'm sorry, Miss.

651
00:45:44,300 --> 00:45:46,300
I'm sorry, Miss.

652
00:45:46,300 --> 00:45:48,300
I'm sorry, Miss.

653
00:45:48,300 --> 00:45:50,300
I'm sorry, Miss.

654
00:45:50,300 --> 00:45:52,300
I'm sorry, Miss.

655
00:45:52,300 --> 00:45:54,300
I'm sorry, Miss.

656
00:45:54,300 --> 00:45:56,300
I'm sorry, Miss.

657
00:45:56,300 --> 00:45:58,300
I'm sorry, Miss.

658
00:45:58,300 --> 00:46:00,300
I'm sorry, Miss.

659
00:46:00,300 --> 00:46:02,300
I'm sorry, Miss.

660
00:46:02,300 --> 00:46:04,300
I'm sorry, Miss.

661
00:46:04,300 --> 00:46:06,300
I'm sorry, Miss.

662
00:46:06,300 --> 00:46:08,300
I'm sorry, Miss.

663
00:46:08,300 --> 00:46:10,300
I'm sorry, Miss.

664
00:46:10,300 --> 00:46:12,300
I'm sorry, Miss.

665
00:46:12,300 --> 00:46:14,300
I'm sorry, Miss.

666
00:46:14,300 --> 00:46:16,300
I'm sorry, Miss.

667
00:46:16,300 --> 00:46:18,300
I'm sorry, Miss.

668
00:46:18,300 --> 00:46:20,300
I'm sorry, Miss.

669
00:46:20,300 --> 00:46:22,300
I'm sorry, Miss.

670
00:46:22,300 --> 00:46:24,300
I'm sorry, Miss.

671
00:46:24,300 --> 00:46:26,300
I'm sorry, Miss.

672
00:46:26,300 --> 00:46:28,300
I'm sorry, Miss.

673
00:46:28,300 --> 00:46:30,300
I'm sorry, Miss.

674
00:46:30,300 --> 00:46:32,300
I'm sorry, Miss.

675
00:46:32,300 --> 00:46:34,300
I'm sorry, Miss.

676
00:46:34,300 --> 00:46:36,300

677
00:46:36,300 --> 00:46:38,300
