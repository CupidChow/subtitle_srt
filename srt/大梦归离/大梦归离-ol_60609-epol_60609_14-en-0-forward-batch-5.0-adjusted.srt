00:10:51,950 --> 00:10:53,350
Even if you offer to sing,

170
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:55,610
no one would dare to listen.

171
00:11:02,670 --> 00:11:04,070
Why are you looking at me?

172
00:11:04,670 --> 00:11:07,180
I heard that you're great at sword dancing,

173
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:08,400
Mr. Zhuo.

174
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:10,240
Why don't you perform for us?

175
00:11:11,160 --> 00:11:12,020
Perform for us.

176
00:11:13,350 --> 00:11:14,060
This...

177
00:11:15,830 --> 00:11:16,630
Brother Zhuo.

178
00:11:16,670 --> 00:11:17,630
Perform for us.

179
00:11:17,790 --> 00:11:18,470
Mr. Zhuo.

180
00:11:18,470 --> 00:11:19,110
Perform for us.

181
00:11:19,110 --> 00:11:19,970
Perform for us.

182
00:11:20,110 --> 00:11:21,640
Brother Zhuo, dance for us.

183
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:22,940
Okay...

184
00:11:23,710 --> 00:11:24,350
Hey.

185
00:11:24,570 --> 00:11:26,100
I think we should forget it.

186
00:11:26,470 --> 00:11:28,970
Mr. Zhuo is normally a no-nonsense person.

187
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:30,400
It's too much

188
00:11:30,430 --> 00:11:32,320
to ask him to perform for us.

189
00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:44,440
Here it comes.

190
00:11:44,460 --> 00:11:46,060
I can perform sword dancing.

191
00:11:46,550 --> 00:11:47,410
Zhao Yuanzhou.

192
00:11:47,540 --> 00:11:49,020
You're not young anymore.

193
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:51,100
You should get up and exercise.

194
00:11:51,450 --> 00:11:52,510
Join me.

Sister.

00:15:21,350 --> 00:15:22,810
I'm not in danger.

256
00:15:23,150 --> 00:15:24,480
Why are you here?

257
00:15:24,950 --> 00:15:26,550
I'm just here to sit with you.

258
00:15:36,630 --> 00:15:37,870
I'll pass.

259
00:15:39,640 --> 00:15:40,680
Alright.

260
00:15:41,430 --> 00:15:42,350
I'll eat it.

261
00:16:17,990 --> 00:16:19,920
Spider, oh spider.

262
00:16:19,950 --> 00:16:22,190
White ape, oh white ape.

263
00:16:22,220 --> 00:16:24,110
Zhao Yuanzhou, oh Zhao Yuanzhou.

264
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:27,130
Jiu.

265
00:16:27,980 --> 00:16:29,130
Why are you still up?

266
00:16:30,060 --> 00:16:32,190
We're leaving early tomorrow morning.

267
00:16:32,190 --> 00:16:32,910
And you.

268
00:16:32,930 --> 00:16:33,790
Zhao Yuanzhou.

269
00:16:34,840 --> 00:16:36,300
You're not young anymore.

270
00:16:36,350 --> 00:16:38,750
Why are you still fooling around with them?

271
00:16:45,890 --> 00:16:47,610
Since you're here,

272
00:16:47,630 --> 00:16:49,620
why don't we play a game?

273
00:16:50,140 --> 00:16:51,060
Sure.

274
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:56,700
In Yao's time, there was such a plant.

275
00:16:56,700 --> 00:16:58,430
It grew on the courtyard steps.

276
00:16:58,510 --> 00:17:00,630
When an ill-meaning liar entered the court,

277
00:17:00,630 --> 00:17:02,630
the leaves would bend to identify them.

278
00:17:02,630 --> 00:17:04,760
It's called the Lie-detecting Plant.

279
00:17:05,750 --> 00:17:06,590
This plant

280
00:17:06,590 --> 00:17:07,960
can discern people's hearts

281
00:17:07,960 --> 00:17:09,440
and see through lies.

282
00:17:09,589 --> 00:17:11,680
If it hears a liar,

283
00:17:12,109 --> 00:17:13,710
its leaves will bend

284
00:17:14,310 --> 00:17:15,369
and appear wilted.

285
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:19,690
Whoever my flute points to later

286
00:17:20,329 --> 00:17:22,220
will answer a question from me.

287
00:17:23,589 --> 00:17:25,160
Let's get started.

288
00:17:25,430 --> 00:17:26,230
Okay.

289
00:17:47,670 --> 00:17:48,880
Just ask.

290
00:17:50,750 --> 00:17:51,630
Pei.

291
00:17:52,590 --> 00:17:53,390
Are you

292
00:17:54,050 --> 00:17:55,840
a spy from Chongwu Camp?

293
00:18:07,630 --> 00:18:08,900
What's going on?

294
00:18:10,490 --> 00:18:11,620
What do you mean?

295
00:18:12,490 --> 00:18:15,150
[To Zhuo Yichen]

296
00:18:12,920 --> 00:18:14,950
We received a letter from Mr. Situ.

297
00:18:16,150 --> 00:18:17,320
According to the letter,

298
00:18:17,320 --> 00:18:19,840
someone tipped Chongwu Camp off.

299
00:18:20,180 --> 00:18:21,320
In other words,

300
00:18:21,430 --> 00:18:22,870
one of us

301
00:18:22,980 --> 00:18:25,060
is a spy from Chongwu Camp.

302
00:18:30,190 --> 00:18:31,110
Chongwu Camp

303
00:18:31,110 --> 00:18:33,750
has been very informed about our movements.

304
00:18:34,630 --> 00:18:37,230
That's why we keep getting blocked in our path.

305
00:18:37,230 --> 00:18:39,430
Only a few people knew that we were going

306
00:18:39,710 --> 00:18:40,510
to Kunlun.

307
00:18:41,790 --> 00:18:43,940
Yet Chongwu Camp knew about it in advance

308
00:18:43,940 --> 00:18:46,470
and made use of Qing Geng to set an ambush here.

309
00:18:48,950 --> 00:18:51,010
With the power of the Shanhai Portal,

310
00:18:51,350 --> 00:18:53,950
we should have directly reached Mount Kunlun.

311
00:18:54,900 --> 00:18:56,650
So who affected Ying Lei

312
00:18:56,680 --> 00:18:58,000
and caused his mistake

313
00:18:58,500 --> 00:19:00,560
which brought us to Sinan Water Town?

314
00:19:03,990 --> 00:19:05,010
I'm sorry.

315
00:19:05,380 --> 00:19:07,350
When I was thinking about Mount Kunlun just now,

316
00:19:07,350 --> 00:19:09,120
I suddenly remembered Ms. Pei mention the

317
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:11,430
Sinan Water Town at the foot of Mount Kunlun,

318
00:19:11,430 --> 00:19:13,960
which is lively during the Lantern Festival.

319
00:19:15,080 --> 00:19:16,980
Who separated us

320
00:19:17,640 --> 00:19:18,560
and let Zhuo

321
00:19:18,580 --> 00:19:20,220
investigate first?

322
00:19:20,250 --> 00:19:21,010
Wait.

323
00:19:21,470 --> 00:19:22,350
Wait for what?

324
00:19:22,380 --> 00:19:23,480
For Jiu to be eaten by the demon?

325
00:19:23,480 --> 00:19:25,100
Don't you think it's strange?

326
00:19:25,100 --> 00:19:26,500
It's obvious that the demon took Jiu

327
00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:28,220
to lure us over.

328
00:19:29,300 --> 00:19:31,750
Mr. Zhuo and Zhao Yuanzhou have gone into the fog.

329
00:19:31,750 --> 00:19:33,110
They're so capable,

330
00:19:33,110 --> 00:19:34,770
they can definitely save Jiu.

331
00:19:35,540 --> 00:19:37,800
We'll only cause trouble if we join them.

332
00:19:37,830 --> 00:19:39,070
Let's wait here

333
00:19:39,090 --> 00:19:40,290
and see what happens.

334
00:19:47,710 --> 00:19:48,550
Pei.

335
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:51,120
Are you

336
00:19:51,990 --> 00:19:54,340
a spy from Chongwu Camp?

337
00:19:56,910 --> 00:19:58,110
No.

338
00:20:14,350 --> 00:20:15,270
Ms. Pei.

339
00:20:16,160 --> 00:20:17,330
You lied.

340
00:20:32,740 --> 00:20:34,500
It's so scary, Sister Pei.

341
00:20:34,790 --> 00:20:35,610
You...

342
00:20:36,280 --> 00:20:37,340
Stay away from her.

343
00:20:58,270 --> 00:20:59,950
Is this your so-called

344
00:21:00,590 --> 00:21:01,400
evidence?

345
00:21:07,790 --> 00:21:08,960
I knew it.

346
00:21:09,350 --> 00:21:10,590
In this world,

347
00:21:10,790 --> 00:21:13,030
there's nothing that can discern the human heart.

348
00:21:13,030 --> 00:21:14,590
The reason it bent was because

349
00:21:14,590 --> 00:21:16,560
dew gathered on the grass.

350
00:21:16,590 --> 00:21:17,550
Mr. Zhuo

351
00:21:17,550 --> 00:21:20,530
used the water-freezing method I taught him

352
00:21:21,030 --> 00:21:23,030
to control the bending of the grass.

353
00:21:31,530 --> 00:21:33,550
How could you, Mr. Zhuo?

354
00:21:33,900 --> 00:21:35,310
I taught you skills,

355
00:21:35,380 --> 00:21:37,910
but you used them to fool people with Wen Xiao.

356
00:21:45,670 --> 00:21:47,250
You wanted to test me?

357
00:21:49,510 --> 00:21:50,310
Yes.

358
00:21:51,830 --> 00:21:53,490
After all, among the six of us,

359
00:21:53,790 --> 00:21:55,590
you are the most suspicious one.

360
00:22:05,940 --> 00:22:07,290
People from the Chongwu Camp

361
00:22:07,290 --> 00:22:08,790
all have a special

362
00:22:09,020 --> 00:22:11,580
cloud tattoo on their wrists

363
00:22:11,720 --> 00:22:13,380
to represent their identity.

364
00:22:14,070 --> 00:22:16,530
I was once the commander of the Chongwu Camp.

365
00:22:16,650 --> 00:22:18,100
It's not a secret.

366
00:22:20,260 --> 00:22:22,400
But I've long left on my own accord.

367
00:22:23,060 --> 00:22:25,860
I have nothing to do with the Chongwu Camp anymore.

368
00:22:26,470 --> 00:22:27,500
Besides,

369
00:22:27,630 --> 00:22:29,670
it was you who convinced me

370
00:22:31,110 --> 00:22:32,170
to join your group.

371
00:22:35,580 --> 00:22:38,300
Besides, I also caught the plague in Lingxi Villa.

372
00:22:38,300 --> 00:22:39,950
I could have died too.

373
00:22:40,130 --> 00:22:42,350
If I were a spy from the Chongwu Camp,

374
00:22:43,630 --> 00:22:45,490
I wouldn't have taken such a risk.

375
00:22:49,630 --> 00:22:51,490
I think what she said makes sense.

376
00:22:57,400 --> 00:22:59,490
Since there is a spy among us,

377
00:23:00,110 --> 00:23:01,870
why can't it be you?

378
00:23:05,270 --> 00:23:07,200
Sister Pei, you sure hold a grudge.

379
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:12,210
I wanted to join the Chongwu Camp.

380
00:23:12,590 --> 00:23:14,670
I heard they know demons very well.

381
00:23:14,690 --> 00:23:16,950
They have a lot of valuable information.

382
00:23:17,270 --> 00:23:19,930
Unfortunately, my father didn't allow me to go.

383
00:23:20,410 --> 00:23:23,010
You're not usually that obedient towards him.

384
00:23:26,110 --> 00:23:27,750
Every Baize Goddess

385
00:23:27,780 --> 00:23:29,080
is good to demons.

386
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:30,520
It's definitely not her.

387
00:23:33,590 --> 00:23:34,920
She treats demons well.

388
00:23:35,220 --> 00:23:36,750
But she treats great demons

389
00:23:37,260 --> 00:23:38,040
not so well.

390
00:23:49,260 --> 00:23:50,830
Why are you all looking at me?

391
00:23:50,830 --> 00:23:52,460
How could I be a spy?

392
00:23:53,430 --> 00:23:54,470
It's hard to say.

393
00:23:54,550 --> 00:23:55,700
That's right.

394
00:23:56,270 --> 00:23:57,680
If I were a spy,

395
00:23:58,070 --> 00:23:59,350
why would I have come to the Demon Hunting Bureau

396
00:23:59,350 --> 00:24:01,010
to help you complete the task?

397
00:24:01,090 --> 00:24:03,530
I worked so hard and did so much.

398
00:24:03,990 --> 00:24:05,350
A trick to gain our sympathy.

399
00:24:05,350 --> 00:24:06,150
Yes.

400
00:24:06,360 --> 00:24:07,820
You love acting anyway.

401
00:24:09,550 --> 00:24:10,930
I'm a demon.

402
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:13,310
The Chongwu Camp specializes in killing demons.

403
00:24:13,310 --> 00:24:15,680
Besides, they're eyeing my inner core.

404
00:24:16,020 --> 00:24:17,110
Zhuo Yichen,

405
00:24:17,510 --> 00:24:19,440
please look clearly with your dog-

406
00:24:21,150 --> 00:24:22,620
Look carefully.

407
00:24:23,630 --> 00:24:24,510
But I remember

408
00:24:24,510 --> 00:24:25,970
someone threatened Mr. Situ

409
00:24:25,970 --> 00:24:27,810
in the Demon Hunting Bureau

410
00:24:27,870 --> 00:24:29,650
and said if we didn't collaborate with you,

411
00:24:29,650 --> 00:24:31,450
you would go to the Chongwu Camp.

412
00:24:31,590 --> 00:24:32,750
I was angry.

413
00:24:32,790 --> 00:24:34,330
I said it out of anger.

414
00:24:34,510 --> 00:24:37,570
Do you humans believe words said out of anger that much?

415
00:24:38,470 --> 00:24:40,200
What's there to be angry about?

416
00:24:40,470 --> 00:24:44,130
I was angry because a woman didn't appreciate my true love for her.

417
00:24:47,270 --> 00:24:48,670
There's no greater agony

418
00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:52,160
than giving your heart to the wrong person.

419
00:24:59,430 --> 00:25:00,820
Who's next?

420
00:25:01,540 --> 00:25:02,200
Him.

421
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:11,040
Huh?

422
00:25:13,790 --> 00:25:15,030
Me?

423
00:25:15,620 --> 00:25:17,410
I'm a cook.

424
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:19,570
A cook is also suitable for being a spy.

425
00:25:19,840 --> 00:25:21,520
Before I met you,

426
00:25:21,640 --> 00:25:23,590
I didn't even know what the Demon Hunting Bureau

427
00:25:23,590 --> 00:25:24,500
or the Chongwu Camp do.

428
00:25:24,500 --> 00:25:25,450
Besides,

429
00:25:25,710 --> 00:25:27,790
you couldn't have gone back

430
00:25:27,810 --> 00:25:28,880
without my Shanhai Portal.

431
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:30,280
You would have been dead.

432
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:31,130
You're right.

433
00:25:31,310 --> 00:25:32,110
Yeah.

434
00:25:32,690 --> 00:25:33,430
I guess Little Mountain God

435
00:25:33,430 --> 00:25:36,070
is better at memorizing recipes than intelligence.

436
00:25:36,070 --> 00:25:37,550
He doesn't meet the Chongwu Camp's standards.

437
00:25:37,550 --> 00:25:38,200
Yeah.

438
00:25:39,640 --> 00:25:41,380
There's no greater agony

439
00:25:41,670 --> 00:25:44,070
than giving your heart to the wrong person.

440
00:25:46,850 --> 00:25:48,640
Speaking of the mountain god temple,

441
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:50,630
when we went back to the Demon Hunting Bureau that day,

442
00:25:50,630 --> 00:25:52,180
whose appearance

443
00:25:52,620 --> 00:25:54,680
made us enter the mountain god temple

444
00:25:55,230 --> 00:25:57,960
and almost fall into the trap of the Chongwu Camp?

445
00:26:00,070 --> 00:26:01,430
I'm just a doctor.

446
00:26:01,790 --> 00:26:03,560
And I went there to welcome you.

447
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:04,800
I'm innocent.

448
00:26:05,030 --> 00:26:06,310
There are also doctors in the Chongwu Camp.

449
00:26:06,310 --> 00:26:07,470
I don't know martial arts.

450
00:26:07,470 --> 00:26:08,990
But you can write prescriptions,

451
00:26:08,990 --> 00:26:10,120
sprinkle medicine,

452
00:26:10,430 --> 00:26:11,880
and do acupuncture.

453
00:26:12,310 --> 00:26:14,040
You're not an ordinary doctor.

454
00:26:15,750 --> 00:26:17,130
I'm timid and afraid of death.

455
00:26:17,130 --> 00:26:17,790
I have hemophobia

456
00:26:17,790 --> 00:26:18,790
and I'm cowardly.

457
00:26:18,950 --> 00:26:21,230
because my mother was seriously ill.

458
00:26:21,230 --> 00:26:22,630
I want to cure my mother.

459
00:26:27,150 --> 00:26:28,480
Your mother's illness?

460
00:26:31,730 --> 00:26:34,130
If your wish is to cure your mother,

461
00:26:35,110 --> 00:26:37,400
the Chongwu Camp has been hunting demons for years.

462
00:26:37,400 --> 00:26:39,330
It has collected many rare herbs

463
00:26:39,350 --> 00:26:40,550
and treasures.

464
00:26:41,750 --> 00:26:44,270
Maybe some of them can help you

465
00:26:45,110 --> 00:26:46,310
fulfill your wish.

466
00:26:49,030 --> 00:26:50,310
Say no more.

467
00:26:50,990 --> 00:26:52,200
The Chongwu Camp's members

468
00:26:52,200 --> 00:26:54,410
have a cloud tattoo on their wrists.

469
00:26:54,760 --> 00:26:56,760
We'll know after we check his wrist.

470
00:27:00,370 --> 00:27:01,420
Hurry up.

471
00:27:03,350 --> 00:27:04,610
I'm going to air it out.

472
00:27:06,080 --> 00:27:07,480
Just a small patch is wet.

473
00:27:07,550 --> 00:27:08,840
Why bother?

474
00:27:09,990 --> 00:27:11,280
Air it out first.

475
00:27:13,370 --> 00:27:14,170
Come on, Jiu.

476
00:27:25,310 --> 00:27:26,330
Brother Zhuo.

477
00:27:30,350 --> 00:27:31,540
Bai Jiu,

478
00:27:32,310 --> 00:27:34,290
we need to check your wrist.

479
00:27:46,750 --> 00:27:48,780
Actually, Mr. Situ gave us a hint

480
00:27:49,350 --> 00:27:50,580
in the letter.

481
00:27:52,310 --> 00:27:53,900
He said

482
00:27:54,930 --> 00:27:56,850
it's most likely that the spy

483
00:27:57,930 --> 00:27:59,140
is Bai Jiu.

484
00:28:00,660 --> 00:28:01,910
I'm not a spy.

485
00:28:02,440 --> 00:28:03,970
Brother Zhuo, trust me.

486
00:28:04,260 --> 00:28:05,730
I really am not.

487
00:28:10,380 --> 00:28:11,860
Then show us your wrist

488
00:28:12,660 --> 00:28:13,890
and we'll know.

489
00:28:18,670 --> 00:28:19,870
E-Even if there is a cloud tattoo on his wrist,

490
00:28:19,870 --> 00:28:21,550
it... it doesn't mean he is

491
00:28:21,620 --> 00:28:22,720
a spy from the Chongwu Camp.

492
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:23,660
Is there any other possibility?

493
00:28:23,660 --> 00:28:24,750
So,

494
00:28:26,300 --> 00:28:28,300
you saw it on Bai Jiu's wrist?

495
00:28:29,960 --> 00:28:31,020
No.

496
00:28:32,350 --> 00:28:34,110
I was just asking.

497
00:28:34,990 --> 00:28:35,790
Ying Lei,

498
00:28:36,790 --> 00:28:38,230
you're so bad at lying.

499
00:28:38,230 --> 00:28:38,910
Well,

500
00:28:39,060 --> 00:28:40,680
how could Jiu be a spy?

501
00:28:40,910 --> 00:28:41,770
Think about it.

502
00:28:41,810 --> 00:28:43,410
He has been treating us.

503
00:28:43,640 --> 00:28:44,610
Without him,

504
00:28:44,670 --> 00:28:46,000
we would have been dead!

505
00:28:46,060 --> 00:28:47,120
-Ying Lei!
-And...

506
00:28:47,940 --> 00:28:48,920
Stop talking.

507
00:28:49,280 --> 00:28:51,280
Your trust in me alone is pointless.

508
00:28:54,570 --> 00:28:55,970
I either have the tattoo,

509
00:28:56,940 --> 00:28:58,130
or I don't.

510
00:29:01,210 --> 00:29:03,060
So is there a cloud tattoo or not?

511
00:29:52,550 --> 00:29:53,430
Brother Zhuo.

512
00:29:57,840 --> 00:29:59,420
Do you believe me now?

513
00:30:07,580 --> 00:30:08,380
Bai Jiu!

514
00:30:34,270 --> 00:30:39,510
♫Has anyone seen a bird with a broken tail?♫

515
00:30:38,070 --> 00:30:38,910
Jiu,

516
00:30:39,560 --> 00:30:40,720
have you gone to bed?

517
00:30:39,700 --> 00:30:44,840
♫The rain wet its feathers♫

518
00:30:46,550 --> 00:30:51,810
♫There're no worries in its eyes♫

519
00:30:51,980 --> 00:30:57,230
♫It just wants to sleep on a roof♫

520
00:30:53,550 --> 00:30:54,350
Little Bunny,

521
00:30:55,430 --> 00:30:56,690
we were too arbitrary.

522
00:30:56,880 --> 00:30:58,010
We apologize to you.

523
00:30:58,150 --> 00:31:01,130
♫The bell jingles and sways♫

524
00:31:01,240 --> 00:31:04,060
♫Thoughts circle back and forth♫

525
00:31:04,600 --> 00:31:09,790
♫Who can truly understand the essence of growing up?♫

526
00:31:07,830 --> 00:31:08,640
Jiu,

527
00:31:09,300 --> 00:31:11,350
I'll give you all the meat next time.

528
00:31:10,460 --> 00:31:13,700
♫Life is grand♫

529
00:31:12,030 --> 00:31:12,890
Don't be angry.

530
00:31:14,370 --> 00:31:16,690
♫Yet so small♫

531
00:31:17,240 --> 00:31:21,930
♫I hope everything is fine♫

532
00:31:50,330 --> 00:31:56,100
♫Has anyone seen a bird with a broken tail?♫

533
00:31:56,350 --> 00:32:01,550
♫The rain wet its feathers♫

534
00:32:04,080 --> 00:32:10,000
♫Its cry has never been heard♫

535
00:32:10,320 --> 00:32:16,640
♫Only I know its story♫

536
00:32:30,800 --> 00:32:33,570
The matter about the Chongwu Camp's spy still needs to be verified.

537
00:32:33,570 --> 00:32:35,150
Why did you tell them?

538
00:32:37,320 --> 00:32:39,450
You know my relationship with Bai Jiu.

539
00:32:39,750 --> 00:32:42,210
I really don't want him to go to Mount Kunlun.

540
00:32:42,630 --> 00:32:44,070
If I stop him from going there,

541
00:32:44,070 --> 00:32:45,670
he will definitely disobey.

542
00:32:45,680 --> 00:32:47,530
That's why I did that.

543
00:32:49,110 --> 00:32:50,270
You really...

544
00:32:50,290 --> 00:32:51,050
My Lord,

545
00:32:51,080 --> 00:32:52,060
our scout found

546
00:32:52,130 --> 00:32:53,840
Commander Zhen has secretly led

547
00:32:53,840 --> 00:32:55,550
a secret elite troop of the Chongwu Camp

548
00:32:55,550 --> 00:32:57,430
to Mount Kunlun.

549
00:33:39,280 --> 00:33:40,080
Jiu.

550
00:33:49,830 --> 00:33:50,780
Did you sleep well,

551
00:33:50,780 --> 00:33:51,820
Little Bunny?

552
00:33:51,980 --> 00:33:52,610
Jiu.

553
00:33:54,830 --> 00:33:57,290
The shopkeeper even gave us a chicken?

554
00:34:00,910 --> 00:34:02,220
I stole it.

555
00:34:02,560 --> 00:34:04,410
Jiu, come and eat.

556
00:34:04,440 --> 00:34:06,170
We should set out after eating.

557
00:34:33,030 --> 00:34:35,100
Looks like the one Little Bunny cares most about

558
00:34:35,100 --> 00:34:37,989
is the great hero in his heart: Mr. Zhuo.

559
00:34:38,150 --> 00:34:39,370
You pissed him off.

560
00:34:39,400 --> 00:34:41,340
Are you sure you're not going to coax him?

561
00:34:41,340 --> 00:34:43,239
We all pissed him off, right?

562
00:34:43,429 --> 00:34:45,040
How come it's my fault?

563
00:34:46,880 --> 00:34:49,520
But he obviously hates you the most now.

564
00:34:51,110 --> 00:34:52,320
Zhao Yuanzhou,

565
00:34:52,670 --> 00:34:54,350
are you very happy now

566
00:34:54,389 --> 00:34:57,320
because finally, someone is more annoying than you?

567
00:34:58,860 --> 00:35:00,880
He's good at fighting and hunting demons.

568
00:35:00,880 --> 00:35:02,590
But coaxing kids

569
00:35:02,750 --> 00:35:04,710
is too difficult for Mr. Zhuo.

570
00:35:05,830 --> 00:35:06,940
It's very easy

571
00:35:07,010 --> 00:35:08,260
to coax kids.

572
00:35:10,140 --> 00:35:11,400
It's very easy.

573
00:35:11,590 --> 00:35:12,670
Give him a candy

574
00:35:12,830 --> 00:35:14,280
and pat him on his head.

575
00:35:23,700 --> 00:35:24,910
Candy?

576
00:36:01,620 --> 00:36:03,920
Dear friends and relatives,

577
00:36:04,240 --> 00:36:06,180
please open your eyes.

578
00:36:06,250 --> 00:36:07,130
What's ahead is

579
00:36:07,710 --> 00:36:09,790
the Kunlun mountain god temple.

580
00:36:17,840 --> 00:36:18,640
Let's go.

581
00:36:26,560 --> 00:36:27,780
♫In this bustling world♫

582
00:36:28,280 --> 00:36:29,220
♫Scattered traces remain♫

583
00:36:29,480 --> 00:36:32,180
♫The riddle of time♫

584
00:36:32,550 --> 00:36:33,940
♫The joy and sorrow of life♫

585
00:36:34,050 --> 00:36:35,260
♫A few hasty lines♫

586
00:36:35,550 --> 00:36:38,060
♫Addressing love and hate♫

587
00:36:38,580 --> 00:36:39,730
♫I wish to become the wind♫

588
00:36:40,100 --> 00:36:41,210
♫And transform into rain♫

589
00:36:41,560 --> 00:36:44,260
♫To accompany you for thousands of miles♫

590
00:36:44,470 --> 00:36:45,640
♫From the south to the north♫

591
00:36:46,020 --> 00:36:47,080
♫From the east to the west♫

592
00:36:47,670 --> 00:36:49,860
♫Fireworks adorn the scene♫

593
00:36:49,940 --> 00:36:53,290
♫You say there are countless rules in this world♫

594
00:36:53,370 --> 00:36:55,690
♫But none can compare to "I am willing"♫

595
00:36:55,810 --> 00:37:01,280
♫I say if fate is determined by Heaven, I'll defy Heaven♫

596
00:36:58,250 --> 00:36:58,890
Grandpa!

597
00:36:58,970 --> 00:36:59,770
I'm back!

598
00:37:01,840 --> 00:37:05,160
♫Wealth and fame turn to dust and drift away♫

599
00:37:05,460 --> 00:37:07,500
♫Love and hate are best left unspoken♫

600
00:37:06,120 --> 00:37:06,750
Grandpa.

601
00:37:07,010 --> 00:37:08,010
Let go.

602
00:37:07,720 --> 00:37:13,420
♫Better to have a dream before parting ways♫

603
00:37:08,550 --> 00:37:10,710
Stop shaking me.

604
00:37:12,230 --> 00:37:13,860
Ying Lei, you're back.

605
00:37:14,270 --> 00:37:15,110
What?

606
00:37:15,560 --> 00:37:18,540
Don't you want to pursue your great dream in the mortal world?

607
00:37:18,540 --> 00:37:20,150
I still want to pursue it.

608
00:37:20,830 --> 00:37:21,470
But we

609
00:37:21,490 --> 00:37:22,830
have found the Baize Token.

610
00:37:22,830 --> 00:37:23,670
The priority

611
00:37:23,710 --> 00:37:24,700
is to come back

612
00:37:24,720 --> 00:37:26,130
to save the Wilderness.

613
00:37:29,910 --> 00:37:30,640
Goddess,

614
00:37:32,040 --> 00:37:33,690
this is my grandpa, Ying Zhao.

615
00:37:33,690 --> 00:37:35,490
That man is Mountain God Zhu Yin.

616
00:37:36,490 --> 00:37:38,260
Goddess, greetings.

617
00:37:40,920 --> 00:37:43,570
Ms. Wen Xiao, thank you for bringing back the Baize Divine Power.

618
00:37:43,570 --> 00:37:45,000
Mountain Gods in the Wilderness

619
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:46,330
will be at your command.

620
00:37:48,920 --> 00:37:49,790
Mr. Zhu Yin,

621
00:37:50,240 --> 00:37:52,160
I just retrieved the Baize Token.

622
00:37:52,770 --> 00:37:54,130
I don't know

623
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:56,600
if I can save the Wilderness.

624
00:37:56,830 --> 00:37:58,550
I still need your guidance.

625
00:37:59,580 --> 00:38:00,830
You brat!

626
00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:04,590
You actually came back.

627
00:38:05,240 --> 00:38:06,570
Brat!

628
00:38:08,750 --> 00:38:09,630
Take this.

629
00:38:09,870 --> 00:38:12,020
I'll hit back if you hit me again.

630
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:13,840
Hit back!

631
00:38:13,990 --> 00:38:14,710
Hit back!

632
00:38:14,900 --> 00:38:15,830
I told you to stop!

633
00:38:15,830 --> 00:38:16,830
Take this. You...

634
00:38:17,990 --> 00:38:18,350
Freeze!

635
00:38:18,350 --> 00:38:20,440
-Cut it out!
-Stop!

636
00:38:20,440 --> 00:38:21,590
Stop!

637
00:38:22,750 --> 00:38:24,450
A master is beating his dog.

638
00:38:24,690 --> 00:38:25,780
He's taming a monkey.

639
00:38:25,780 --> 00:38:27,440
I helped you clear up the mess.

640
00:38:27,570 --> 00:38:29,640
Have you forgotten the rules

641
00:38:29,740 --> 00:38:31,760
and moral characters I told you?

642
00:38:33,050 --> 00:38:33,760
Grandpa Ying Zhao.

643
00:38:33,760 --> 00:38:34,560
Take this!

644
00:38:40,620 --> 00:38:42,650
You are the legendary Torch Dragon?

645
00:38:42,810 --> 00:38:44,300
Goddess, you know me?

646
00:38:45,040 --> 00:38:46,020
Legend has it that

647
00:38:46,020 --> 00:38:48,220
you're the most mysterious Dragon God.

648
00:38:48,450 --> 00:38:51,580
You can illuminate the darkest part of the netherworld.

649
00:39:15,130 --> 00:39:16,690
Zhu Yin and I

650
00:39:16,720 --> 00:39:18,740
have guarded the gate for years.

651
00:39:21,680 --> 00:39:22,960
Now,

652
00:39:22,990 --> 00:39:25,190
Mount Kunlun is about to collapse.

653
00:39:25,430 --> 00:39:26,430
The Wilderness

654
00:39:26,570 --> 00:39:27,920
is at stake.

655
00:39:31,990 --> 00:39:33,720
The 28 constellations

656
00:39:33,950 --> 00:39:35,800
have vanished.

657
00:39:36,310 --> 00:39:38,660
There is nothing we can do.

658
00:39:39,810 --> 00:39:41,630
But now that Goddess is back,

659
00:39:41,950 --> 00:39:44,030
we just need to activate the Star Formation

660
00:39:44,030 --> 00:39:45,390
and inject the Baize Divine Power.

661
00:39:45,390 --> 00:39:47,190
Then we can save the Wilderness.

662
00:39:47,390 --> 00:39:49,250
There's something very strange.

663
00:39:50,230 --> 00:39:51,290
Grandpa Ying Zhao,

664
00:39:51,630 --> 00:39:52,830
you've lived for many years.

665
00:39:52,830 --> 00:39:54,600
Help me analyze it.

666
00:39:55,990 --> 00:39:57,420
You are

667
00:39:57,500 --> 00:39:59,110
still so annoying.

668
00:39:59,120 --> 00:40:00,570
You live up to your name.

669
00:40:00,910 --> 00:40:02,110
Just ask.

670
00:40:03,400 --> 00:40:05,470
The Baize Token has been missing for so long.

671
00:40:05,470 --> 00:40:07,670
I didn't expect it to be divided into two

672
00:40:08,020 --> 00:40:10,500
and left in Wen Xiao and me.

673
00:40:11,140 --> 00:40:12,400
But why couldn't I feel

674
00:40:12,880 --> 00:40:15,450
the Baize Token at all before?

675
00:40:15,990 --> 00:40:17,870
Since the Original Goddess,

676
00:40:18,800 --> 00:40:20,370
for the sake of fairness,

677
00:40:20,840 --> 00:40:23,260
the Baize Token has been divided into two,

678
00:40:23,510 --> 00:40:26,270
kept by a person and a demon.

679
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:28,360
Only when the two keepers

680
00:40:28,650 --> 00:40:30,070
share a telepathic connection

681
00:40:30,070 --> 00:40:31,800
and fall in love with each other

682
00:40:31,920 --> 00:40:34,570
can they activate and use the power.

683
00:40:44,980 --> 00:40:46,670
This is too sudden.

684
00:40:52,070 --> 00:40:52,910
Since

685
00:40:52,940 --> 00:40:54,940
Goddess has regained her power,

686
00:40:54,960 --> 00:40:56,800
I guess you two already

687
00:40:56,950 --> 00:40:57,990
trust each other

688
00:40:58,690 --> 00:41:00,690
and share a telepathic connection.

689
00:41:04,190 --> 00:41:06,320
Zhao Yuanzhou, you're so despicable.

690
00:41:06,330 --> 00:41:08,150
Brother Zhuo and Wen

691
00:41:08,170 --> 00:41:09,510
are childhood sweethearts.

692
00:41:09,510 --> 00:41:10,510
How could you

693
00:41:10,510 --> 00:41:11,310
do this?

694
00:41:11,350 --> 00:41:13,050
So what if they've fallen in love with each other?

695
00:41:13,050 --> 00:41:14,670
Brotherhood is also love.

696
00:41:14,700 --> 00:41:16,220
Friendship is also love.

697
00:41:16,480 --> 00:41:18,680
We went through hardships along the way

698
00:41:18,710 --> 00:41:19,750
and shared weal and woe.

699
00:41:19,750 --> 00:41:21,150
We can say we share a telepathic connection.

700
00:41:21,150 --> 00:41:22,180
No need to mind it.

701
00:41:22,850 --> 00:41:23,570
-Yes.
-Yes.

702
00:41:23,930 --> 00:41:25,480
Mr. Zhuo, you are

703
00:41:25,640 --> 00:41:26,650
prudent.

704
00:41:27,660 --> 00:41:29,060
Stop talking about this.

705
00:41:29,390 --> 00:41:30,920
Let's hurry up

706
00:41:30,940 --> 00:41:32,510
and activate the formation.

707
00:41:32,510 --> 00:41:34,230
But the spiritual energy of Mount Kunlun

708
00:41:34,230 --> 00:41:35,790
has weakened long ago.

709
00:41:36,670 --> 00:41:39,620
The Star Formation requires a lot of spiritual energy.

710
00:41:39,620 --> 00:41:41,070
We'd better activate it

711
00:41:41,670 --> 00:41:43,630
at noon, when the spiritual energy

712
00:41:43,630 --> 00:41:44,630
is the strongest.

713
00:41:47,410 --> 00:41:48,970
Let's wait till tomorrow.

714
00:41:54,870 --> 00:41:56,950
Stall them in Sinan Water Town.

715
00:41:57,430 --> 00:41:58,780
Can you do it?

716
00:41:58,810 --> 00:42:00,410
How long should I stall them?

717
00:42:00,750 --> 00:42:01,630
It has to be

718
00:42:02,040 --> 00:42:03,120
just the right time.
