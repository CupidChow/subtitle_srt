It's sends me a lot ofBaby!

31
00:02:55,100 --> 00:02:59,100
Coffee Even said I must wait until I see them again there.

32
00:02:59,100 --> 00:03:03,100
I can't wait, but I'm not sure if I can get the key to the room.

33
00:03:03,100 --> 00:03:07,100
I'm sorry, but I'm not sure if I can get the key to the room.

34
00:03:07,100 --> 00:03:11,100
I don't have any right, but why do I need the key to the room?

35
00:03:14,100 --> 00:03:17,100
I'm sorry, but it's false, but I'm not sure if I can pull up.

36
00:03:17,100 --> 00:03:24,100
Do you still remember the day I was alone?

00:03:38,100 --> 00:03:42,100
Of course!

40
00:03:46,100 --> 00:03:49,100
Zonghu, Zoe

41
00:03:54,100 --> 00:03:57,600
That's right. Are you scared?

42
00:03:57,600 --> 00:04:00,100
This is the magic night.

43
00:04:00,100 --> 00:04:03,600
It's been a long time since it was invented.

44
00:04:07,100 --> 00:04:10,100
But this isn't his real body.

45
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:13,600
His real body...

46
00:04:15,100 --> 00:04:17,600
Do you want to see it?

47
00:04:25,100 --> 00:04:28,100
Where is the key?

48
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:34,100
You can't escape.

49
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:43,100
Don't look at me as a kid. I'm really good.

50
00:04:43,100 --> 00:04:44,100
What are you laughing at?

51
00:04:44,100 --> 00:04:46,600
I'm not laughing at you as a kid.

52
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:50,100
I'm not going to escape if I'm laughing.

53
00:04:51,100 --> 00:04:53,600
Xiao Zhige, Sister Pei.

54
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:58,600
You can't escape. I'm a good kid.

55
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:02,100
I'm teaching you to be a big man.

56
00:05:13,100 --> 00:05:15,100
Bai Jiu, come here!

57
00:05:15,100 --> 00:05:17,100
Xiao Zhige!

58
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:27,140

Who are Mrs. Chu and Zha sewing,

Where'sен Miss?

62
00:05:47,100 --> 00:05:49,100
Bai Jiu, back in time,

63
00:05:49,100 --> 00:05:50,780
Walk alone.

64
00:06:19,100 --> 00:06:21,500
No matter where I go

65
00:06:21,500 --> 00:06:23,420
With my blood, I'll go?

66
00:06:23,420 --> 00:06:27,220
No, water, sorrow, Jennifer

67
00:06:39,540 --> 00:06:40,780
Xia Zhuge

68
00:07:19,100 --> 00:07:25,920
It作尽收见

69
00:07:26,020 --> 00:07:28,260
这一只手,

70
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:31,520
How much more to come?

71
00:07:31,660 --> 00:07:35,620
You want to kill the tiger Perez?

72
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:39,860
A very keen Connective

73
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:42,160
What do you want?

74
00:07:42,260 --> 00:07:47,100
I just want to get old with my old friend.

75
00:07:47,100 --> 00:07:49,100
What's wrong?

76
00:07:56,100 --> 00:07:57,100
It's a trap.

77
00:08:01,100 --> 00:08:04,100
He's trying to escape from the god.

78
00:08:07,100 --> 00:08:08,100
Xiao Zhu, they're in danger.

79
00:08:14,100 --> 00:08:16,100
You have two choices now.

80
00:08:17,100 --> 00:08:21,100
Go to the god and save your friends.

81
00:08:23,100 --> 00:08:25,100
Leave him to me.

82
00:08:29,100 --> 00:08:31,100
Or keep him here.

83
00:08:33,100 --> 00:08:37,100
Let your friends die.

84
00:08:38,100 --> 00:08:39,100
Go to Xiao Zhu.

85
00:08:40,100 --> 00:08:42,100
I have a blood relation with you.

86
00:08:43,100 --> 00:08:44,100
I have to protect you.

87
00:08:44,100 --> 00:08:46,100
What about Xiao Zhu?

88
00:08:47,100 --> 00:08:49,100
Xiao Zhu is a person who can't win.

89
00:08:50,100 --> 00:08:53,100
Without a demon, he can't be punished.

90
00:08:54,100 --> 00:08:58,100
Xiao Zhu is not in a problem to deal with them.

91
00:09:17,100 --> 00:09:19,100
You're not Chu Wuyin.

92
00:09:21,100 --> 00:09:23,100
Chu Wuyin has no such beast.

93
00:09:48,100 --> 00:09:49,100
What?

94
00:10:05,100 --> 00:10:06,100
I know.

95
00:10:06,100 --> 00:10:07,100
I know.

96
00:10:18,100 --> 00:10:19,100
Sister Pei.

97
00:10:20,100 --> 00:10:21,100
This is it.

98
00:10:23,100 --> 00:10:25,100
Xiao Zhu, this is it.

99
00:10:26,100 --> 00:10:29,100
This is the talisman that Xing Tian drew.

100
00:10:29,100 --> 00:10:30,100
Xing Tian?

101
00:10:32,100 --> 00:10:35,100
The demon is not in a fight.

102
00:10:35,100 --> 00:10:36,100
He's called Xing Tian.

103
00:10:37,100 --> 00:10:40,100
Bai Qiang, I'm responsible for dealing with them.

104
00:10:40,100 --> 00:10:42,100
You have to destroy all the talisman.

105
00:10:42,100 --> 00:10:43,100
Okay.

106
00:11:47,100 --> 00:11:48,100
But...

107
00:11:48,100 --> 00:11:49,100
But...

108
00:11:49,100 --> 00:11:50,100
Chu Wuyin...

109
00:11:50,100 --> 00:11:51,100
But...

110
00:11:52,100 --> 00:11:54,100
Why did Chu Wuyin give us up?

111
00:11:55,100 --> 00:11:56,100
From the beginning,

112
00:11:57,100 --> 00:11:59,100
he was the one who killed me.

113
00:12:00,100 --> 00:12:01,100
I'm sorry.

114
00:12:02,100 --> 00:12:03,100
I'm sorry.

115
00:12:04,100 --> 00:12:05,100
But...

116
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:08,100
why did Chu Wuyin give us up?

117
00:12:09,100 --> 00:12:10,100
Because...

118
00:12:11,100 --> 00:12:13,100
he was the one who killed us.

119
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:15,100
But...

120
00:12:16,100 --> 00:12:18,100
why did Chu Wuyin give us up?

121
00:12:18,100 --> 00:12:19,100
Why did he give us up?

122
00:12:19,100 --> 00:12:20,100
From the beginning,

123
00:12:21,100 --> 00:12:23,100
he was the one who killed me.

124
00:12:24,100 --> 00:12:27,100
As long as you take the demon to the Liao people,

125
00:12:27,100 --> 00:12:30,100
I have my own way to make them go to the Liao people.

126
00:12:32,100 --> 00:12:33,100
You did it on purpose

127
00:12:34,100 --> 00:12:36,100
to take me away.

128
00:12:37,100 --> 00:12:38,100
Chu Wuyin and Yu Chun.

129
00:12:39,100 --> 00:12:41,100
They don't deserve your action.

130
00:12:43,100 --> 00:12:45,100
You have to take the half-murder.

131
00:12:45,100 --> 00:12:47,100
The heaven and hell are all mine.

132
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:50,100
They all deserve it.

133
00:12:54,100 --> 00:12:56,100
He doesn't deserve the godess

134
00:12:56,100 --> 00:13:00,100
who is not powerful enough to stand with you.

135
00:13:03,100 --> 00:13:05,100
My old friend needs

136
00:13:07,100 --> 00:13:10,100
to be laughed at by this bastard.

137
00:13:11,100 --> 00:13:13,100
I'll kill him for you.

138
00:13:13,100 --> 00:13:15,100
You can try.

139
00:13:19,100 --> 00:13:21,100
How long can you keep him?

140
00:13:22,100 --> 00:13:24,100
At this moment,

141
00:13:25,100 --> 00:13:28,100
it's still a lifetime.

142
00:13:36,100 --> 00:13:38,100
Don't look back on me.

143
00:13:44,100 --> 00:13:46,100
The blood between me and Lillun

144
00:13:46,100 --> 00:13:47,100
is not enough.

145
00:13:48,100 --> 00:13:50,100
You can make a Liao.

146
00:13:57,100 --> 00:13:59,100
You are now in the godless world

147
00:14:00,100 --> 00:14:02,100
and you are a mortal.

148
00:14:04,100 --> 00:14:05,100
Liao.

149
00:14:08,100 --> 00:14:10,100
Are you going to kill me?

150
00:14:16,100 --> 00:14:18,100
I'll kill you.

151
00:14:30,100 --> 00:14:31,100
The mortal's body

152
00:14:32,100 --> 00:14:34,100
can't be seen for a long time.

153
00:14:36,100 --> 00:14:39,100
Are you afraid that he will see you?

154
00:14:47,100 --> 00:14:49,100
I don't have any blood.

155
00:15:13,100 --> 00:15:15,100
It was another packet.

156
00:15:16,100 --> 00:15:18,100
Didn't you say you were going to the sea?

157
00:15:18,100 --> 00:15:19,100
Did you have to take a break?

158
00:15:19,100 --> 00:15:21,100
A man's revenge is not an end to ten years.

159
00:15:21,100 --> 00:15:23,100
A woman's revenge is the most important.

160
00:15:34,100 --> 00:15:36,100
Are you okay?

161
00:15:39,100 --> 00:15:40,100
Let me do it.

162
00:15:40,100 --> 00:15:41,100
I'm a doctor.

163
00:15:46,100 --> 00:15:48,100
I'll do it.

164
00:16:04,100 --> 00:16:05,100
Why are you crying?

165
00:16:07,100 --> 00:16:09,100
You and Pei Ji's hands are so good.

166
00:16:10,100 --> 00:16:12,100
If it wasn't for me,

167
00:16:13,100 --> 00:16:14,100
I would be hurt.

168
00:16:15,100 --> 00:16:16,100
I stole it from you.

169
00:16:22,100 --> 00:16:25,100
But you found the talismans.

170
00:16:28,100 --> 00:16:30,100
You destroyed them yourself.

171
00:16:34,100 --> 00:16:35,100
Xiaoqiao,

172
00:16:36,100 --> 00:16:37,100
if it wasn't for you,

173
00:16:38,100 --> 00:16:41,100
we wouldn't have been hurt this time.

174
00:16:45,100 --> 00:16:46,100
Really?

175
00:16:47,100 --> 00:16:48,100
It's a disaster.

176
00:16:51,100 --> 00:16:52,100
Please.

177
00:16:53,100 --> 00:16:54,100
No, please.

178
00:16:54,100 --> 00:16:55,100
Please.

179
00:16:55,100 --> 00:16:56,100
I'm going to die soon.

180
00:16:56,100 --> 00:16:58,100
My wound is bleeding.

181
00:17:02,100 --> 00:17:04,100
Although your medical team is good,

182
00:17:05,100 --> 00:17:07,100
it's still too much for your own good.

183
00:17:07,100 --> 00:17:09,100
You should use less in the future.

184
00:17:09,100 --> 00:17:11,100
I'll make some ginger cakes for you.

185
00:17:11,100 --> 00:17:13,100
I'll see if there's anything else inside.

186
00:17:15,100 --> 00:17:16,100
Xiao'an.

187
00:17:18,100 --> 00:17:19,100
Xiao'an.

188
00:17:38,100 --> 00:17:39,100
Thank you.

189
00:17:45,100 --> 00:17:47,100
You're talking to me again?

190
00:17:48,100 --> 00:17:50,100
It's all thanks to you this time.

191
00:17:53,100 --> 00:17:57,100
I won't see you again in the future.

192
00:18:00,100 --> 00:18:01,100
Hu Bazhang.

193
00:18:01,100 --> 00:18:03,100
As long as I'm here,

194
00:18:03,100 --> 00:18:04,100
you'll never die.

195
00:18:08,100 --> 00:18:09,100
No more words.

196
00:18:10,100 --> 00:18:11,100
I'll do it.

197
00:18:12,100 --> 00:18:13,100
No more words?

198
00:18:15,100 --> 00:18:17,100
I'm going to ask the Lord of the Lord for some words.

199
00:18:23,100 --> 00:18:26,100
As long as you're alone,

200
00:18:27,100 --> 00:18:30,100
I'll do anything for you next time.

201
00:18:32,100 --> 00:18:34,100
I'm a commander.

202
00:18:34,100 --> 00:18:36,100
I have the responsibility to protect you.

203
00:18:37,100 --> 00:18:38,100
I'm taller than you.

204
00:18:38,100 --> 00:18:39,100
I'm taller than you.

205
00:18:40,100 --> 00:18:42,100
I have the responsibility to protect you.

206
00:18:49,100 --> 00:18:50,100
Are you okay?

207
00:18:52,100 --> 00:18:54,100
There's Pei Jie Jie and Xiao Zhuoran.

208
00:18:54,100 --> 00:18:55,100
It's nothing.

209
00:18:57,100 --> 00:18:58,100
I don't believe you,

210
00:18:59,100 --> 00:19:00,100
but I don't believe him.

211
00:19:08,100 --> 00:19:09,100
Are you okay?

212
00:19:16,100 --> 00:19:17,100
I don't need it.

213
00:19:23,100 --> 00:19:24,100
I'll give you some medicine

214
00:19:25,100 --> 00:19:26,100
so you can kill me later.

215
00:19:26,100 --> 00:19:27,100
It's easier.

216
00:19:39,100 --> 00:19:40,100
I'm so happy.

217
00:19:41,100 --> 00:19:42,100
I'm going to graduate.

218
00:20:09,100 --> 00:20:10,100
Lord Ding Gao.

219
00:20:11,100 --> 00:20:12,100
You failed.

220
00:20:13,100 --> 00:20:14,100
You're so useless.

221
00:20:14,100 --> 00:20:16,100
You can't even think of a way to die.

222
00:20:25,100 --> 00:20:26,100
Who are you?

223
00:20:27,100 --> 00:20:29,100
I'm the only one who has the right to kill.

224
00:20:32,100 --> 00:20:34,100
I'm the only one who has the right to kill.

225
00:20:34,100 --> 00:20:36,100
I'm the only one who has the right to kill.

226
00:20:38,100 --> 00:20:39,100
Look at me.

227
00:20:59,100 --> 00:21:01,100
I want a big answer.

228
00:21:02,100 --> 00:21:03,100
Three questions.

229
00:21:04,100 --> 00:21:05,100
I'm right.

230
00:21:06,100 --> 00:21:07,100
I'm wrong.

231
00:21:09,100 --> 00:21:10,100
I'm wrong.

232
00:21:11,100 --> 00:21:12,100
I'm dead.

233
00:21:13,100 --> 00:21:14,100
Let's go.

234
00:21:17,100 --> 00:21:18,100
First,

235
00:21:19,100 --> 00:21:21,100
do you think it's good to be a good person

236
00:21:22,100 --> 00:21:24,100
or a good demon?

237
00:21:26,100 --> 00:21:27,100
Demon.

238
00:21:28,100 --> 00:21:29,100
Demon.

239
00:21:32,100 --> 00:21:33,100
Demon.

240
00:21:35,100 --> 00:21:36,100
I'm wrong.

241
00:21:42,100 --> 00:21:43,100
You killed my Chongqing,

242
00:21:44,100 --> 00:21:46,100
but you didn't kill me.

243
00:21:47,100 --> 00:21:49,100
You didn't tell me

244
00:21:51,100 --> 00:21:52,100
about the death of Lord Zhao Yuanzhou.

245
00:21:55,100 --> 00:21:57,100
I actually think you're Chongqing.

246
00:21:58,100 --> 00:22:00,100
I've been a traitor a long time.

247
00:22:00,100 --> 00:22:01,540
You helped me kill him.

248
00:22:01,540 --> 00:22:02,540
I'm sorry.

249
00:22:03,260 --> 00:22:04,660
It's good that you know.

250
00:22:05,260 --> 00:22:06,340
Don't forget...

251
00:22:07,180 --> 00:22:09,060
the promise I made to you.

252
00:22:09,460 --> 00:22:11,500
I will find Bai Zeyu for you.

253
00:22:30,100 --> 00:22:31,100
Miss.

254
00:22:33,100 --> 00:22:34,100
Miss.

255
00:22:43,100 --> 00:22:44,100
Miss.

256
00:22:57,100 --> 00:22:58,100
It's bad.

257
00:22:58,100 --> 00:22:59,100
It's bad.

258
00:22:59,100 --> 00:23:00,100
It's bad.

259
00:23:00,100 --> 00:23:01,100
It's bad.

260
00:23:03,100 --> 00:23:04,100
It's so urgent.

261
00:23:05,100 --> 00:23:06,100
You're so bad.

262
00:23:07,100 --> 00:23:08,100
It's my fault.

263
00:23:08,100 --> 00:23:09,100
The size is too small.

264
00:23:09,100 --> 00:23:10,100
The strength is too small.

265
00:23:10,100 --> 00:23:11,100
My waist is too small.

266
00:23:11,100 --> 00:23:12,100
I can't fit the medicine.

267
00:23:12,100 --> 00:23:14,100
I can only make it up to Mr. Zhou.

268
00:23:15,100 --> 00:23:17,100
But I didn't have the money to pay for the big project.

269
00:23:17,100 --> 00:23:18,100
I have to pay for the big project.

270
00:23:18,100 --> 00:23:19,100
I can't do it.

271
00:23:20,100 --> 00:23:22,100
Mr. Zhou just broke his wrist.

272
00:23:23,100 --> 00:23:25,100
He didn't get a car accident.

273
00:23:26,100 --> 00:23:27,100
You don't understand.

274
00:23:27,100 --> 00:23:29,100
Do you think everyone is like you?

275
00:23:29,100 --> 00:23:30,100
You're so skinny.

276
00:23:30,100 --> 00:23:31,100
You can just try it.

277
00:23:31,100 --> 00:23:32,100
You can get hurt.

278
00:23:32,100 --> 00:23:33,100
Before you die,

279
00:23:33,100 --> 00:23:35,100
Mr. Zhou will protect me and Pei.

280
00:23:36,100 --> 00:23:37,100
He's just...

281
00:23:37,100 --> 00:23:38,100
the bad guy.

282
00:23:38,100 --> 00:23:39,100
He's even a bad guy.

283
00:23:39,100 --> 00:23:40,100
He's so weak.

284
00:23:46,100 --> 00:23:47,100
You're blind.

285
00:23:47,100 --> 00:23:49,100
I'll bring you some qinxin and mucus.

286
00:23:49,100 --> 00:23:51,100
You should take the medicine.

287
00:23:51,100 --> 00:23:52,100
Just go with your eyes.

288
00:23:52,100 --> 00:23:54,100
I have a strong waist.

289
00:23:55,100 --> 00:23:56,100
But you're blind.

290
00:23:56,100 --> 00:23:58,100
You only have a small waist.

291
00:23:59,100 --> 00:24:00,100
My friend,

292
00:24:00,100 --> 00:24:02,100
you'll find out that

293
00:24:02,100 --> 00:24:04,100
you're more powerful

294
00:24:04,100 --> 00:24:06,100
when you're wide-eyed.

295
00:24:07,100 --> 00:24:08,100
For example, Pei.

296
00:24:15,100 --> 00:24:16,100
He's even more talkative.

297
00:24:22,100 --> 00:24:23,100
Don't waste my time.

298
00:24:23,100 --> 00:24:24,100
I'm going to the bathroom.

299
00:24:24,100 --> 00:24:25,100
What are you doing?

300
00:24:25,100 --> 00:24:27,100
Don't you think I'm weak?

301
00:24:27,100 --> 00:24:28,100
I can use my power

302
00:24:28,100 --> 00:24:29,100
to make your small waist

303
00:24:29,100 --> 00:24:31,100
very big.

304
00:24:31,100 --> 00:24:32,100
In the future,

305
00:24:32,100 --> 00:24:33,100
you can put all the drugs

306
00:24:33,100 --> 00:24:34,100
in there.

307
00:24:34,100 --> 00:24:35,100
Don't be afraid

308
00:24:35,100 --> 00:24:36,100
of Mr. Zhou getting hurt.

309
00:24:36,100 --> 00:24:38,100
You won't be able to save him.

310
00:24:38,100 --> 00:24:40,100
You're so stupid.

311
00:24:51,100 --> 00:24:52,100
So big.

312
00:24:55,100 --> 00:24:56,100
No.

313
00:24:56,100 --> 00:24:57,100
I'm going in.

314
00:25:06,100 --> 00:25:07,100
It's so dark.

315
00:25:10,100 --> 00:25:11,100
How do I take it back?

316
00:25:11,100 --> 00:25:12,100
How can it be so big?

317
00:25:13,100 --> 00:25:14,100
Did you see the lamp above?

318
00:25:15,100 --> 00:25:16,100
Shake it.

319
00:25:26,100 --> 00:25:27,100
How is it?

320
00:25:27,100 --> 00:25:29,100
I'm better than Mr. Zhou, right?

321
00:25:32,100 --> 00:25:33,100
You have to admit it.

322
00:25:34,100 --> 00:25:35,100
Between the witness...

323
00:25:51,100 --> 00:25:52,100
Xiao Zhu.

324
00:25:52,100 --> 00:25:54,100
Listen to me.

325
00:25:55,100 --> 00:25:57,100
I'm not going to get off the bed.

326
00:26:03,100 --> 00:26:04,100
Don't mind him.

327
00:26:04,100 --> 00:26:05,100
What I want to say is,

328
00:26:06,100 --> 00:26:08,100
the witness is the only one

329
00:26:08,100 --> 00:26:10,100
who can get off the bed.

330
00:26:10,100 --> 00:26:12,100
There's no need to get off the bed.

331
00:26:15,100 --> 00:26:18,100
Miss Wen Xiao and my hero are in the same boat.

332
00:26:23,100 --> 00:26:24,100
Zhu Yan.

333
00:26:24,100 --> 00:26:26,100
What a nice name.

334
00:26:27,100 --> 00:26:28,100
Which one?

335
00:26:28,100 --> 00:26:30,100
The one who's in the test.

336
00:26:34,100 --> 00:26:35,100
Mr. Zhou.

337
00:26:35,100 --> 00:26:37,100
Your medical team has a secret

338
00:26:37,100 --> 00:26:39,100
in the water-coated ice.

339
00:26:39,100 --> 00:26:41,100
That's better than letting go.

340
00:26:42,100 --> 00:26:43,100
I don't know.

341
00:26:45,100 --> 00:26:47,100
You don't know how to do it.

342
00:26:48,100 --> 00:26:50,100
You don't know how to do it?

343
00:26:50,100 --> 00:26:51,100
Of course.

344
00:26:52,100 --> 00:26:54,100
I've written so many books.

345
00:26:54,100 --> 00:26:56,100
Zhu Yan, Da Yao.

346
00:26:56,100 --> 00:26:58,100
There are thousands of fairy tales.

347
00:26:58,100 --> 00:26:59,100
There are so many.

348
00:27:00,100 --> 00:27:03,100
Miss Wen Xiao's name is also very nice.

349
00:27:03,100 --> 00:27:05,100
Which one?

350
00:27:05,100 --> 00:27:06,100
The one who's in the test.

351
00:27:14,100 --> 00:27:15,100
Mr. Zhou.

352
00:27:16,100 --> 00:27:17,100
I can teach you.

353
00:27:17,100 --> 00:27:18,100
You can't learn it.

354
00:27:18,100 --> 00:27:20,100
You can use the blood

355
00:27:20,100 --> 00:27:23,100
to use the blood pulse to follow you.

356
00:27:24,100 --> 00:27:26,100
You just have to stop talking.

357
00:27:27,100 --> 00:27:29,100
Then come here.

358
00:27:30,100 --> 00:27:31,100
What?

359
00:27:31,100 --> 00:27:35,100
The medical secret is not only stopped by the others.

360
00:27:37,100 --> 00:27:38,100
The others?

361
00:27:41,100 --> 00:27:43,100
Then I'll take my leave.

362
00:27:43,100 --> 00:27:44,100
No need.

363
00:27:45,100 --> 00:27:48,100
This is the medical secret of the blood pulse.

364
00:27:48,100 --> 00:27:50,100
It's useless to listen to others.

365
00:27:50,100 --> 00:27:52,100
Then what are you doing?

366
00:27:52,100 --> 00:27:53,100
I can't learn it.

367
00:27:53,100 --> 00:27:54,100
Follow me.

368
00:27:55,100 --> 00:27:56,100
Okay.

369
00:28:05,100 --> 00:28:06,100
This person.

370
00:28:07,100 --> 00:28:08,100
Please take a look.

371
00:28:08,100 --> 00:28:09,100
Okay.

372
00:28:19,100 --> 00:28:20,100
What?

373
00:28:30,100 --> 00:28:32,100
The blood is coming from the heart.

374
00:28:32,100 --> 00:28:34,100
The heart is coming from the heart.

375
00:28:34,100 --> 00:28:38,100
You just continue to follow the blood pulse I've drawn.

376
00:28:49,100 --> 00:28:51,100
The body is weak.

377
00:28:51,100 --> 00:28:53,100
The blood is not reduced.

378
00:29:03,100 --> 00:29:05,100
Wen Jiang is so ugly.

379
00:29:07,100 --> 00:29:09,100
The tea is so cold.

380
00:29:09,100 --> 00:29:11,100
It's as cold as my heart.

381
00:29:11,100 --> 00:29:12,100
Isn't it good?

382
00:29:12,100 --> 00:29:14,100
The tea is so cold.

383
00:29:14,100 --> 00:29:15,100
It's called fire.

384
00:29:16,100 --> 00:29:18,100
You're not lucky.

385
00:29:19,100 --> 00:29:21,100
But if you hit me,

386
00:29:22,100 --> 00:29:24,100
I'm afraid you'll have to practice for a long time.

387
00:29:27,100 --> 00:29:28,100
Mr. Zhu.

388
00:29:28,100 --> 00:29:30,100
Take care of yourself.

389
00:29:38,100 --> 00:29:40,100
You're really not able to make it?

390
00:29:40,100 --> 00:29:41,100
Get up quickly.

391
00:29:41,100 --> 00:29:42,100
Don't get in the way.

392
00:29:42,100 --> 00:29:44,100
I'll stay here to take care of Xiao'e.

393
00:29:45,100 --> 00:29:47,100
Xiao'e, you go back first.

394
00:29:47,100 --> 00:29:49,100
Don't let Mr. Zhu take care of you.

395
00:29:49,100 --> 00:29:50,100
No.

396
00:29:50,100 --> 00:29:52,100
I have to stay here to protect you.

397
00:29:52,100 --> 00:29:54,100
If you find Li Lun,

398
00:29:54,100 --> 00:29:56,100
you can't deal with him.

399
00:29:57,100 --> 00:29:58,100
Li Lun?

400
00:30:02,100 --> 00:30:03,100
Who is Li Lun?

401
00:30:15,100 --> 00:30:17,100
Then according to what you said,

402
00:30:17,100 --> 00:30:19,100
Li Lun came here because of you.

403
00:30:20,100 --> 00:30:22,100
Do you know Li Lun?

404
00:30:23,100 --> 00:30:25,100
I know him when I was little.

405
00:30:26,100 --> 00:30:28,100
Then what kind of medicine is he?

406
00:30:28,100 --> 00:30:31,100
Why can he be reborn into a human?

407
00:30:31,100 --> 00:30:33,100
Li Lun is a Chinese medicine.

408
00:30:33,100 --> 00:30:36,100
The body is a rare ancient Chinese medicine.

409
00:30:36,100 --> 00:30:39,100
It can be found in any Chinese medicine.

410
00:30:39,100 --> 00:30:42,100
It's a non-dark, soul-relieving body.

411
00:30:42,100 --> 00:30:44,100
It's a body that is composed of other goods.

412
00:30:44,100 --> 00:30:46,100
It controls the behavior of the body.

413
00:30:46,100 --> 00:30:48,100
He's looking for you?

414
00:30:48,100 --> 00:30:49,100
Yes.

415
00:30:50,100 --> 00:30:52,100
Are you hiding from him?

416
00:30:52,100 --> 00:30:54,100
He was my hiding place.

417
00:30:54,100 --> 00:30:57,100
I chose him to be a part of the Yangshan Sect.

418
00:30:57,100 --> 00:30:59,100
He was a small town.

419
00:30:59,100 --> 00:31:01,100
He always wanted to revenge on me.

420
00:31:01,100 --> 00:31:04,100
So I chose to cooperate with Ji Yaosi.

421
00:31:04,100 --> 00:31:06,100
Please help me deal with him.

422
00:31:07,100 --> 00:31:10,100
I didn't expect you guys to be so weak.

423
00:31:13,100 --> 00:31:15,100
I'm sorry.

424
00:31:17,100 --> 00:31:19,100
Do you know there's a magic town here?

425
00:31:22,100 --> 00:31:25,100
If someone is looking for a lie,

426
00:31:25,100 --> 00:31:27,100
please leave the fox's tail.

427
00:31:34,100 --> 00:31:36,100
I'm tired.

428
00:31:36,100 --> 00:31:38,100
I'm so tired.

429
00:31:38,100 --> 00:31:40,100
I'm so tired.

430
00:31:40,100 --> 00:31:42,100
The Red Army is being killed.

431
00:31:42,100 --> 00:31:45,100
What?

432
00:31:50,100 --> 00:31:52,100
Xiaochun, you have a rest.

433
00:31:52,100 --> 00:31:54,100
Don't worry.

434
00:31:55,100 --> 00:31:57,100
Zheng Yunzhao, come with me.

435
00:32:00,100 --> 00:32:02,100
Go back.

436
00:32:10,100 --> 00:32:12,180
Let's go.

437
00:32:31,780 --> 00:32:33,160
Mr. Han.

438
00:32:33,160 --> 00:32:34,480
Huian died.

439
00:32:34,540 --> 00:32:36,900
Will vallahi We chegar?

440
00:32:37,520 --> 00:32:39,740
We prefer General.

441
00:32:40,100 --> 00:32:41,900
He was killed by the Jiao Si.

442
00:32:41,900 --> 00:32:42,700
Do you understand?

443
00:32:42,980 --> 00:32:43,660
Yes.

444
00:32:45,420 --> 00:32:47,500
Wu Yan was killed by the Jiao Si.

445
00:32:47,700 --> 00:32:49,380
How could he be killed by the Jiao Si?

446
00:32:49,660 --> 00:32:51,780
The storm is coming.

447
00:32:52,100 --> 00:32:54,220
The Jiao Si is in front of the king.

448
00:32:54,500 --> 00:32:56,100
Fortunately, the gun is shooting.

449
00:32:56,580 --> 00:32:57,900
We have been fighting for it.

450
00:32:58,060 --> 00:32:59,460
It's the last day.

451
00:33:00,500 --> 00:33:01,660
The last day?

452
00:33:01,940 --> 00:33:04,020
It's not even five days.

453
00:33:04,540 --> 00:33:05,900
It's going to die tomorrow.

454
00:33:06,020 --> 00:33:07,740
The king thank you five

455
00:33:07,900 --> 00:33:09,300
will catch the water ghost

456
00:33:09,300 --> 00:33:10,700
before noon tomorrow.

457
00:33:11,020 --> 00:33:12,180
Otherwise,

458
00:33:12,460 --> 00:33:14,300
the whole Jiao Si

459
00:33:14,940 --> 00:33:16,620
will be in a mess.

460
00:33:21,460 --> 00:33:23,300
It's only one day left.

461
00:33:26,180 --> 00:33:27,780
We can't drag the water ghost

462
00:33:27,780 --> 00:33:28,300
into the gold market anymore.

463
00:33:28,300 --> 00:33:29,500
It's too late.

464
00:33:30,020 --> 00:33:31,500
We have to take the initiative.

465
00:33:31,740 --> 00:33:32,860
We'll catch him today.

466
00:33:33,140 --> 00:33:34,300
How?

467
00:33:34,740 --> 00:33:36,180
The blood flow is not short.

468
00:33:36,540 --> 00:33:37,340
It's not short.

469
00:33:38,740 --> 00:33:40,060
And the last person.

470
00:33:40,620 --> 00:33:42,580
One is hiding in the dark.

471
00:33:43,740 --> 00:33:45,380
But the other is the important person.

472
00:33:47,380 --> 00:33:48,460
Miss Qi.

473
00:33:49,420 --> 00:33:50,740
The dead body of the water ghost

474
00:33:50,740 --> 00:33:52,820
was killed by the water ghost.

475
00:33:53,220 --> 00:33:55,020
But other than Miss Qi,

476
00:33:55,380 --> 00:33:56,540
the other bride

477
00:33:56,540 --> 00:33:58,580
didn't get the soul of the person.

478
00:33:59,220 --> 00:34:00,780
I believe there must be a secret

479
00:34:01,740 --> 00:34:02,940
on her body.

480
00:34:02,940 --> 00:34:03,780
Miss Qi.

481
00:34:07,940 --> 00:34:09,220
Miss Qi is missing.

482
00:34:11,940 --> 00:34:12,940
Miss Qi?

483
00:34:17,060 --> 00:34:18,260
What should we do?

484
00:34:18,700 --> 00:34:20,300
The only clue is also broken.

485
00:34:24,020 --> 00:34:25,580
There is another clue.

486
00:34:29,300 --> 00:34:30,500
Master Qi.

487
00:34:31,500 --> 00:34:33,460
Master Qi deliberately leaked the news

488
00:34:33,460 --> 00:34:34,700
of the water ghost.

489
00:34:35,180 --> 00:34:36,300
He asked me and Zhuo Tonglin

490
00:34:36,300 --> 00:34:37,100
to investigate.

491
00:34:37,380 --> 00:34:38,420
He was ambushed.

492
00:34:38,980 --> 00:34:40,380
He was suspicious.

493
00:34:41,060 --> 00:34:42,540
You go to the Qifu

494
00:34:43,020 --> 00:34:44,700
and investigate Master Qi.

495
00:34:45,060 --> 00:34:47,060
I'll use the power to track Miss Qi.

496
00:34:47,860 --> 00:34:49,220
Maybe we can find her.

497
00:34:50,780 --> 00:34:51,380
Okay.

498
00:34:51,740 --> 00:34:52,980
Let's split up.

499
00:35:00,860 --> 00:35:01,260
Save me.

500
00:35:22,060 --> 00:35:23,220
Why are you here by yourself?

501
00:35:27,580 --> 00:35:28,900
No, no, no.

502
00:35:28,900 --> 00:35:30,100
She's missing.

503
00:35:31,100 --> 00:35:31,900
What about her?

504
00:35:32,500 --> 00:35:34,020
She's missing.

505
00:35:35,620 --> 00:35:36,660
Isn't she here?

506
00:35:38,620 --> 00:35:39,620
She's missing.

507
00:35:54,060 --> 00:35:55,460
When she came here,

508
00:35:55,940 --> 00:35:57,300
Hu Xin didn't do it.

509
00:35:58,300 --> 00:36:00,300
She was hidden by the sister.

510
00:36:02,020 --> 00:36:03,860
But Zhang Yuan Zhou, a demon,

511
00:36:05,100 --> 00:36:06,420
didn't find out.

512
00:36:07,940 --> 00:36:09,940
Because she and Ranyi have been together for a long time.

513
00:36:11,820 --> 00:36:12,740
Master Xiu Chu,

514
00:36:13,620 --> 00:36:14,740
take care of yourself.

515
00:36:27,860 --> 00:36:30,140
Fortunately, we got here

516
00:36:30,460 --> 00:36:31,700
after Master Pei's demon.

517
00:36:37,500 --> 00:36:38,580
She was followed.

518
00:36:39,340 --> 00:36:40,180
So annoying.

519
00:36:41,820 --> 00:36:43,020
Master Pei is here.

520
00:36:43,500 --> 00:36:45,740
Our Jiao Si team is really like a tiger.

521
00:36:46,180 --> 00:36:46,940
It's great.

522
00:36:51,380 --> 00:36:52,780
After the case is settled,

523
00:36:53,900 --> 00:36:55,340
I will withdraw from Jiao Si.

524
00:36:56,140 --> 00:36:56,900
Why?

525
00:36:58,100 --> 00:37:00,500
I didn't want to involve in Jiao Si's case.

526
00:37:00,980 --> 00:37:02,780
Although Zhang Yuan Zhou has my brother,

527
00:37:03,140 --> 00:37:04,180
he has me in his hands.

528
00:37:05,780 --> 00:37:07,420
I've never trusted him.

529
00:37:08,340 --> 00:37:11,580
At that time, Jiao Si was just to return the token.

530
00:37:12,900 --> 00:37:15,420
But under the pretext of the bad luck,

531
00:37:16,020 --> 00:37:17,300
he was in a state of disarray.

532
00:37:19,140 --> 00:37:21,020
Now, Ranyi is colluding with her.

533
00:37:21,380 --> 00:37:22,420
She can't trust him.

534
00:37:23,180 --> 00:37:25,340
Zhu Yan is a fate that is controlled by you.

535
00:37:26,500 --> 00:37:28,780
Don't force him to know more than I would.

536
00:37:30,500 --> 00:37:32,860
I hope you can stop

537
00:37:33,420 --> 00:37:34,840
digging into my lifemediately.

538
00:37:37,160 --> 00:37:39,120
If it's not you who invited me here,

539
00:37:40,100 --> 00:37:42,220
then forgive me for my rudeness.

540
00:37:52,420 --> 00:37:56,560
If you still can't find time to say goodbye to me either,

541
00:37:57,280 --> 00:38:01,800
I have nothing else to wish me.

542
00:38:02,140 --> 00:38:06,220
I just want you to mistake this.

543
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:09,260
Infinity Peak

544
00:38:09,460 --> 00:38:10,620
Take care.

545
00:38:11,140 --> 00:38:11,820
CARN requiem

546
00:38:12,580 --> 00:38:14,480
Chief

547
00:38:14,980 --> 00:38:15,980
Help me.

548
00:38:17,620 --> 00:38:19,860
Why does he keep sending his men to the superintendent?

549
00:38:20,380 --> 00:38:21,920
得罪

550
00:38:22,420 --> 00:38:41,780
10 comply

551
00:38:53,420 --> 00:38:54,480
For me..

552
00:38:57,140 --> 00:38:58,220
Are you81?

553
00:39:01,320 --> 00:39:02,240
Look.

554
00:39:04,220 --> 00:39:05,540
Baron будет zhuo.

555
00:39:22,420 --> 00:39:26,680
OK you can do as we teach you now,

556

But you know what fear Apperm Lind 어븅

558
00:39:32,880 --> 00:39:33,960
time and space,

559
00:39:34,520 --> 00:39:36,200
not bringing vision and image to Cecilia

00:39:36,360 --> 00:39:37,800
said sorry I let you down.

561
00:39:38,340 --> 00:39:39,100
And without vão

where you alone in increasingly

563
00:39:40,420 --> 00:39:42,480
apart

564
00:39:43,040 --> 00:39:45,560
or even talking to your past

PUTE

566
00:39:48,560 --> 00:39:49,180

00:39:49,360 --> 00:39:50,560
not to ask me

00:39:53,260 --> 00:39:57,360
Otherwise, they will be trapped forever in this dream.

570
00:39:59,560 --> 00:40:00,560
Besides,

571
00:40:01,960 --> 00:40:03,960

00:40:38,560 --> 00:40:39,560
Interesting.

574
00:40:40,560 --> 00:40:43,560
How can you fight against my dream?

575
00:40:46,560 --> 00:40:47,560
It's him.

00:41:50,560 --> 00:41:52,560
It's him.

The End

00:43:20,560 --> 00:43:25,560
The End

583
00:43:50,560 --> 00:43:56,560
The End

584
00:44:20,560 --> 00:44:26,560
The End

585
00:44:50,560 --> 00:44:56,560
