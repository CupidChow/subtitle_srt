00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:05,000
I'm sorry, but I'm not sure if I can get the money back.

3
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:10,000
I'm sorry, but I'm not sure if I can get the money back.

4
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:15,000
I'm sorry, but I'm not sure if I can get the money back.

5
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:20,000
I'm sorry, but I'm not sure if I can get the money back.

6
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:25,000
I'm sorry, but I'm not sure if I can get the money back.

00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Trans Simply

8
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:35,980
The horse is running in

9
00:01:39,780 --> 00:01:40,400
so far

10
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:43,960
Choose theyeong

00:01:44,900 --> 00:01:45,640
and lavish

13
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:47,640
Are you waiting for a twist?

14
00:01:47,700 --> 00:01:51,200
We'd better disregard these science prodigies.

15
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:53,700
If they don't mind

16
00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:55,540
we can have them

17
00:01:55,540 --> 00:01:57,900
back to chef Bai.

18
00:01:58,160 --> 00:01:59,480
You'd better

19
00:01:59,480 --> 00:02:01,480
You finally said that.

20
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:03,480
You are well-known.

21
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:05,480
I thought you would call him your best friend.

22
00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:07,480
I don't want that.

23
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:09,480
It's too serious.

24
00:02:09,480 --> 00:02:12,480
I still want to be a free demon.

25
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:14,480
I will follow my heart.

26
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:16,480
No fear, no fear.

27
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:18,480
No fear, no fear.

28
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:26,480
The Starry Sky Formation needs two gods to open up at the same time.

29
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:31,480
I and Zhu Yin will help you.

30
00:02:31,480 --> 00:02:37,480
You two must use the power of the White-Haired Man in the town.

31
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:39,480
That's great.

32
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:41,480
We can save the Great Great Phoenix.

33
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:43,480
Sister Pei.

34
00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:51,480
Where is Xiao Zhou?

35
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:53,480
Xiao Zhou is a little old.

36
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:56,480
She didn't understand that we didn't fight her on purpose.

37
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:58,480
It was just a moment ago.

38
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:00,480
I don't know what happened.

39
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:02,480
I don't know what happened.

40
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:04,480
I don't know what happened.

41
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:06,480
I don't know what happened.

42
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:08,480
I don't know what happened.

43
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:10,480
I don't know what happened.

44
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:12,480
It was just a moment ago.

45
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:14,480
I can't be careless.

46
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:16,480
You're right.

47
00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:21,480
But the formation of the Demon-Haired Man was indeed detected by Zhu Yin.

48
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:23,480
So, in that moment,

49
00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:27,480
it shouldn't be just a personal misunderstanding.

50
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:32,480
By the way, Sister Pei.

51
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:34,480
Where are you going?

52
00:03:35,480 --> 00:03:38,480
The number of chasing the Demon-Haired Man is very precise.

53
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:40,480
Especially the Demon-Haired Man.

54
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:42,480
It's 100-0.

55
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:46,480
Maybe they are chasing Zhang Yuan Zhou.

56
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:48,480
During the future security period,

57
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:51,480
I'll go to the surrounding city first.

58
00:04:05,480 --> 00:04:07,480
Little kid.

59
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:09,480
It's very simple.

60
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:11,480
Just give him candy.

61
00:04:11,480 --> 00:04:13,480
Just give him a little head.

62
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:19,480
You're going to kill me?

63
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:36,480
You like to eat the fruit, right?

64
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:06,480
Yan Yan.

65
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:08,480
For so many years,

66
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:11,480
you've been keeping this Demon-Haired Man.

67
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:13,480
Don't you think it's hard?

68
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:15,480
Hard?

69
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:17,480
I don't think so.

70
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:19,480
I'm not sure.

71
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:21,480
I'm not sure.

72
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:23,480
I think it's hard.

73
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:25,480
I think it's hard.

74
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:27,480
I think it's hard.

75
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:29,480
I think it's hard.

76
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:31,480
I think it's hard.

77
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:33,480
I think it's hard.

78
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:37,480
But it's also a responsibility.

79
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:43,480
Little kid.

80
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:47,480
Do you know what the condition of becoming a god is?

81
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:51,480
If there is a blood-drenched blood,

82
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:53,480
it's also necessary to be punished.

83
00:05:56,480 --> 00:05:58,480
You're wrong.

84
00:05:58,480 --> 00:06:01,480
I really want you to become a god.

85
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:06,480
I just want to protect the firm determination of the King.

86
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:15,480
Child.

87
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:21,480
Whether you stay in the King or go to the human world,

88
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:24,480
you decide it yourself.

89
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:27,480
No matter what you choose,

90
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:29,480
I will support you.

91
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:33,480
The world is a journey of three thousand miles,

92
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:36,480
and three thousand seven hundred thousand.

93
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:39,480
That's your way.

94
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:42,480
You decide it yourself.

95
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:04,480
You really can't bear to see Lord Xiao Zhuo give you a fruit.

96
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:06,480
You have the habit of doing it.

97
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:10,480
It seems that Xiao Zhuo's apology is a mess.

98
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:12,480
He really can't believe it.

99
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:16,480
I'm scolding him.

100
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:18,480
Why are you scolding him?

101
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:21,480
If they suspect you, are you angry?

102
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:24,480
As long as I'm as clear as the clear,

103
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:26,480
I will be able to see the truth.

104
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:29,480
As long as I'm as clear as the clear,

105
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:32,480
I will not care about others' suspicion.

106
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:39,480
Lord, you are so noble.

107
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:41,480
You are born in the Great Wall.

108
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:44,480
You don't know how to control the world.

109
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:46,480
You should be a good demon.

110
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:49,480
You don't need to be so greedy.

111
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:51,480
Where are you going?

112
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:53,480
I'm going to do some bad things.

113
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:55,480
I want to have fun.

114
00:07:55,480 --> 00:07:58,480
When did Xiao Bai Tu become so evil?

115
00:07:58,480 --> 00:08:00,480
Eat it, you're a gold-gatherer.

116
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:11,480
There's no one here. Say it.

117
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:19,480
What did you say?

118
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:23,480
What will happen tomorrow and the day?

119
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:27,480
You were just facing the burden.

120
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:29,480
Something must be wrong.

121
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:33,480
I didn't expect Lord Shen Yu to care about me so much.

122
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:35,480
I'm so touched.

123
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:38,480
There's no way.

124
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:40,480
If you want to be free from the blame,

125
00:08:40,480 --> 00:08:42,480
you must be kind to me.

126
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:49,480
You asked me

127
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:52,480
why I was controlled by Li Qi.

128
00:08:55,480 --> 00:08:57,480
You didn't answer me at that time.

129
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:06,480
I was controlled by Xue Yue that night.

130
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:11,480
Xue Yue?

131
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:16,480
Xue Yue was the most important thing in Li Qi.

132
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:20,480
All Li Qi's power is in me.

133
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:23,480
If I can't control it,

134
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:26,480
I'll be forced to do it.

135
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:33,480
Could it be...

136
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:37,480
that night?

137
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:46,480
You're worried that you'll lose your control again.

138
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:50,480
When Xue Yue was in the army,

139
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:54,480
I was forced to do it.

140
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:56,480
I lost consciousness.

141
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:00,480
I was so evil.

142
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:05,480
I killed many people.

143
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:15,480
In the end, Xue Yue will be in the army.

144
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:18,480
But I don't know why.

145
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:23,480
I was so happy that I recovered soon.

146
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:27,480
I was in the white earth tower.

147
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:36,480
I've been wandering around.

148
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:40,480
Now I think that

149
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:43,480
your master Zhang Wan'er

150
00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:46,480
has sent half of the white earth order to me.

151
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:49,480
He has suppressed my power.

152
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:53,480
If not like this,

153
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:56,480
the consequences will be terrible.

154
00:10:58,480 --> 00:10:59,480
You're so selfish.

155
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:02,480
You helped me find the white earth order.

156
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:04,480
It's for...

157
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:06,480
to beg for death.

158
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:09,480
You also killed time's desire

159
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:15,480
to beg for my heart.

160
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:24,480
You know your master Zhang Wan'er

161
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:28,480
gave me the name of his brother.

162
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:32,480
I don't know.

163
00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:39,480
I also asked him this question.

164
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:42,480
He answered me,

165
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:47,480
because the bitter sea is also a curse.

166
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:50,480
The endless longings

167
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:52,480
and death

168
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:57,480
are the only nine trees in the earth.

169
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:04,480
If I lose tomorrow,

170
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:10,480
you must kill me with the white earth order.

171
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:37,480
I'll kill you.

172
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:51,480
Children,

173
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:53,480
wait a minute.

174
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:57,480
The time in your hands is coming.

175
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:03,480
If

176
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:06,480
the white earth order has been in your body,

177
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:10,480
you won't be forced to do anything.

178
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:13,480
You won't be empty.

179
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:16,480
Yes.

180
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:20,480
But to start the new method,

181
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:24,480
the white earth order must be removed.

182
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:29,480
The method is complete in the world.

183
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:31,480
After that,

184
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:33,480
you'll divide the white earth order

185
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:36,480
and send it back to your body.

186
00:13:43,480 --> 00:13:45,480
It's better than

187
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:46,480
killing people

188
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:48,480
after you lose your control.

189
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:53,480
You actually

190
00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:57,480
can be with the demon.

191
00:13:57,480 --> 00:13:59,480
The demon is a natural.

192
00:13:59,480 --> 00:14:01,480
That's why it needs to be said.

193
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:05,480
You want to be demonized.

194
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:09,480
We also hope that the demon won't be born.

195
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:12,480
But there's always a demon disguised as a human

196
00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:14,480
who is in the mortal world

197
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:17,480
and is afraid.

198
00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:29,480
You always say you hate the fire.

199
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:31,480
But in fact,

200
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:34,480
you love it more than anyone else.

201
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:37,480
Am I right?

202
00:14:43,480 --> 00:14:44,480
No.

203
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:51,480
What's wrong with you?

204
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:56,480
You've been like this lately.

205
00:14:57,480 --> 00:14:58,480
It's not the first time.

206
00:14:59,480 --> 00:15:01,480
What's wrong with you?

207
00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:03,480
It's all your fault for making a mess.

208
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:07,480
Which one is the violation?

209
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:13,480
It's a violation of the human's love

210
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:16,480
and the relationship between the two.

211
00:15:23,480 --> 00:15:25,480
The violation of the contract

212
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:27,480
is a violation of the human's love.

213
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:31,480
You're so cruel.

214
00:15:37,480 --> 00:15:39,480
I'll do my best to help you.

215
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:41,480
You're so pitiful.

216
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:43,480
I'll teach you a lesson

217
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:45,480
to relieve your pain.

218
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:48,480
Such a lesson?

219
00:15:49,480 --> 00:15:50,480
You didn't say it earlier.

220
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:51,480
The color is empty.

221
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:53,480
The color is empty.

222
00:15:57,480 --> 00:15:58,480
The light is bright.

223
00:15:59,480 --> 00:16:00,480
I miss you so much.

224
00:16:01,480 --> 00:16:03,480
I want to clean up the appearance of the monster.

225
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:10,480
Look at Xiao Zhuo.

226
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:11,480
Look at you.

227
00:16:11,480 --> 00:16:12,480
It's a violation of the human's love.

228
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:16,480
You and Xiao Zhuo are brothers and sisters.

229
00:16:17,480 --> 00:16:18,480
You're a brother and sister.

230
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:19,480
You're different from Xiao Zhuo.

231
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:22,480
You're just a brother and sister

232
00:16:23,480 --> 00:16:25,480
for Xiao Zhuo to be my brother and sister.

233
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:27,480
Can you agree?

234
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:29,480
What else can it be?

235
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:31,480
I have to say

236
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:33,480
Xiao Zhuo is a good man.

237
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:36,480
He's the family of the ten thousand girls in Tian Duchen.

238
00:16:37,480 --> 00:16:39,480
He and I are childhood friends.

239
00:16:41,480 --> 00:16:42,480
Listen.

240
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:49,480
What's wrong?

241
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:53,480
The sound of the loudspeaker.

242
00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:54,480
The sound of the loudspeaker.

243
00:17:17,480 --> 00:17:18,480
I know I can't persuade you.

244
00:17:19,480 --> 00:17:20,480
But I believe

245
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:21,480
that one day

246
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:24,480
you will meet the one who wants you to live.

247
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:52,480
I'm sorry.

248
00:17:53,480 --> 00:17:54,480
I'm sorry.

249
00:17:55,480 --> 00:17:56,480
I'm sorry.

250
00:17:57,480 --> 00:17:58,480
I'm sorry.

251
00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:00,480
I'm sorry.

252
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:02,480
I'm sorry.

253
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:04,480
I'm sorry.

254
00:18:05,480 --> 00:18:06,480
I'm sorry.

255
00:18:07,480 --> 00:18:08,480
I'm sorry.

256
00:18:09,480 --> 00:18:10,480
I'm sorry.

257
00:18:11,480 --> 00:18:12,480
I'm sorry.

258
00:18:13,480 --> 00:18:14,480
I'm sorry.

259
00:18:15,480 --> 00:18:16,480
I'm sorry.

260
00:18:17,480 --> 00:18:18,480
I'm sorry.

261
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:19,480
I'm sorry.

262
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:21,480
I'm sorry.

263
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:25,480
You're still in the old place.

264
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:27,480
I'm sorry.

265
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:45,480
I'm sorry.

266
00:18:45,480 --> 00:18:48,480
You can find me here.

267
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:55,480
Xiaojiu.

268
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:01,480
You're really a good man.

269
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:03,480
You don't sleep at night.

270
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:05,480
You're secretly in love.

271
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:07,480
I learned it from you.

272
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:09,480
I killed you.

273
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:11,480
I'm sorry.

274
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:14,480
We're happy.

275
00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:16,480
Of course we're in love.

276
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:19,480
Love is good.

277
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:21,480
But if you don't want it,

278
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:23,480
you'll be in a hurry.

279
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:25,480
You'll be in a hurry.

280
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:29,480
You want me to lock you up?

281
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:31,480
I taught you.

282
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:33,480
Of course I want to.

283
00:19:45,480 --> 00:19:46,480
I'm sorry.

284
00:19:47,480 --> 00:19:48,480
I'm sorry.

285
00:19:49,480 --> 00:19:50,480
I'm sorry.

286
00:19:51,480 --> 00:19:52,480
I'm sorry.

287
00:19:53,480 --> 00:19:54,480
I'm sorry.

288
00:19:55,480 --> 00:19:56,480
I'm sorry.

289
00:19:57,480 --> 00:19:58,480
I'm sorry.

290
00:19:59,480 --> 00:20:00,480
I'm sorry.

291
00:20:01,480 --> 00:20:02,480
I'm sorry.

292
00:20:03,480 --> 00:20:04,480
I'm sorry.

293
00:20:05,480 --> 00:20:06,480
I'm sorry.

294
00:20:07,480 --> 00:20:08,480
I'm sorry.

295
00:20:09,480 --> 00:20:10,480
I'm sorry.

296
00:20:11,480 --> 00:20:12,480
I'm sorry.

297
00:20:13,480 --> 00:20:14,480
I'm sorry.

298
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:16,480
I'm sorry.

299
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:47,480
Who is he?

300
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:49,480
Your ancestor,

301
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:52,480
the first owner of the Cloud Light Sword.

302
00:20:57,480 --> 00:20:58,480
That sword move

303
00:20:59,480 --> 00:21:01,480
was used by the soldiers to kill Yinglong.

304
00:21:03,480 --> 00:21:04,480
Can I kill you?

305
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:07,480
Yinglong is much better than me.

306
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:09,480
He's a good man.

307
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:11,480
If he can kill Yinglong,

308
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:13,480
he can kill me.

309
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:14,480
Please give me a good gift.

310
00:21:17,480 --> 00:21:18,480
Why did you call me?

311
00:21:19,480 --> 00:21:20,480
Didn't you say

312
00:21:21,480 --> 00:21:22,480
you wanted me to kill you?

313
00:21:23,480 --> 00:21:24,480
You're lying.

314
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:27,480
I didn't.

315
00:21:27,480 --> 00:21:28,480
You didn't lie

316
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:29,480
when you were in the dungeon

317
00:21:29,480 --> 00:21:31,480
and I was on the verge of the end.

318
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:36,480
I taught you the real use of the sword.

319
00:21:37,480 --> 00:21:39,480
Then you killed me.

320
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:41,480
You were

321
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:43,480
so heartless and

322
00:21:43,480 --> 00:21:44,480
so blinded.

323
00:21:45,480 --> 00:21:46,480
But now,

324
00:21:47,480 --> 00:21:48,480
I can tell

325
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:49,480
you don't want to die.

326
00:21:55,480 --> 00:21:56,480
Is it because of Wenxiao?

327
00:22:01,480 --> 00:22:02,480
I always think that

328
00:22:03,480 --> 00:22:04,480
the Great Huang is a good man.

329
00:22:05,480 --> 00:22:07,480
It's boring to live for a thousand years.

330
00:22:07,480 --> 00:22:08,480
It's boring to live for a thousand years.

331
00:22:09,480 --> 00:22:10,480
But after a few times,

332
00:22:11,480 --> 00:22:12,480
I found out that

333
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:13,480
the fire is burning.

334
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:15,480
There's no place for it.

335
00:22:15,480 --> 00:22:16,480
So I don't want to die for now.

336
00:22:17,480 --> 00:22:18,480
Zhao Yunche,

337
00:22:19,480 --> 00:22:20,480
trust me.

338
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:21,480
The more you die,

339
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:23,480
the more you don't want to die.

340
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:25,480
No matter how you treat Wenxiao,

341
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:27,480
I'll let you down.

342
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:29,480
One day,

343
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:32,480
I'll teach you the sword.

344
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:35,480
If I really

345
00:22:35,480 --> 00:22:37,480
can't get the real place of Yun Gong,

346
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:40,480
I'll learn the sword skills of the illusion.

347
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:43,480
You won't regret it.

348
00:22:49,480 --> 00:22:50,480
I won't regret it.

349
00:22:53,480 --> 00:22:54,480
I don't understand.

350
00:22:55,480 --> 00:22:56,480
Why not?

351
00:22:57,480 --> 00:22:58,480
Since you don't want to die,

352
00:22:59,480 --> 00:23:00,480
why do you still want to teach me

353
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:03,480
to live so self-sufficiently?

354
00:23:03,480 --> 00:23:05,480
Don't you feel sad?

355
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:09,480
Many people in this world

356
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:11,480
live in self-sufficiently.

357
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:13,480
Not only me.

358
00:23:15,480 --> 00:23:17,480
I can't go back to my hometown.

359
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:20,480
But I always have a voice in my heart.

360
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:22,480
I'll call you to accompany me.

361
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:29,480
Mr. Luo,

362
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:31,480
tomorrow,

363
00:23:31,480 --> 00:23:33,480
the magic needle will be used to make the king of the world.

364
00:23:35,480 --> 00:23:36,480
If anything happens,

365
00:23:39,480 --> 00:23:40,480
I hope you can...

366
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:41,480
If there's any danger,

367
00:23:41,480 --> 00:23:43,480
I'll ask Xiao Zhou.

368
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:49,480
I mean,

369
00:23:49,480 --> 00:23:50,480
you,

370
00:23:51,480 --> 00:23:52,480
a thousand years of the Great Demon,

371
00:23:53,480 --> 00:23:54,480
do you need me to protect you?

372
00:23:55,480 --> 00:23:56,480
You're not ashamed.

373
00:23:56,480 --> 00:23:57,480
How is that possible?

374
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:04,480
I mean, I hope you can live well.

375
00:24:09,480 --> 00:24:10,480
You don't need to say it.

376
00:24:11,480 --> 00:24:12,480
You owe me a life.

377
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:15,480
If you don't die,

378
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:17,480
I won't be able to die.

379
00:24:19,480 --> 00:24:20,480
Okay.

380
00:24:21,480 --> 00:24:23,480
Then you don't have to say anything.

381
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:27,480
Let me die first.

382
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:49,480
Xiao,

383
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:52,480
should we go with Mr. Pei?

384
00:24:53,480 --> 00:24:54,480
No, that's good.

385
00:24:57,480 --> 00:24:58,480
Yinglei,

386
00:24:58,480 --> 00:25:00,480
go out and stand here with me.

387
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:02,480
I want to ask them if they're okay.

388
00:25:03,480 --> 00:25:04,480
No problem.

389
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:13,480
It's already noon.

390
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:16,480
I'll turn it on once I'm done.

391
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:17,480
Don't interrupt.

392
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:21,480
Are you ready?

393
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:28,480
I'm ready.

394
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:58,480
The Great Demon

395
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:22,480
Finally, we're here.

396
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:27,480
The Great Demon

397
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:35,480
Zhu Yin,

398
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:37,480
get ready.

399
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:40,480
The heart is not frozen,

400
00:26:41,480 --> 00:26:42,480
but the heart is frozen.

401
00:26:57,480 --> 00:26:58,480
The Great Demon

402
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:01,480
is the one who will protect you.

403
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:03,480
The Great Demon

404
00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:05,480
is the one who will protect you.

405
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:07,480
Drink it.

406
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:27,480
The Great Demon

407
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:29,480
is the one who will protect you.

408
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:31,480
The Great Demon

409
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:33,480
is the one who will protect you.

410
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:35,480
The Great Demon

411
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:37,480
is the one who will protect you.

412
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:39,480
The Great Demon

413
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:41,480
is the one who will protect you.

414
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:43,480
The Great Demon

415
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:45,480
is the one who will protect you.

416
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:47,480
The Great Demon

417
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:49,480
is the one who will protect you.

418
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:51,480
The Great Demon

419
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:53,480
is the one who will protect you.

420
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:55,480
The Great Demon

421
00:27:56,480 --> 00:27:57,480
is the one who will protect you.

422
00:27:58,480 --> 00:27:59,480
The Great Demon

423
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:01,480
is the one who will protect you.

424
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:03,480
The Great Demon

425
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:05,480
is the one who will protect you.

426
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:07,480
The Great Demon

427
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:09,480
is the one who will protect you.

428
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:11,480
The Great Demon

429
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:13,480
is the one who will protect you.

430
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:15,480
The Great Demon

431
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:17,480
is the one who will protect you.

432
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:19,480
The Great Demon

433
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:21,480
is the one who will protect you.

434
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:23,480
The Great Demon

435
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:25,480
is the one who will protect you.

436
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:27,480
The Great Demon

437
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:41,480
What's going on?

438
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:51,480
Zhu Yin, you...

439
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:53,480
Zhu Yin

440
00:28:53,480 --> 00:28:55,480
you are really in trouble.

441
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:03,480
Two gods can be completed

442
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:05,480
by the Star Formation.

443
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:07,480
Ying Zhao,

444
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:09,480
it's useless to be alone.

445
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:11,480
Don't think about saving the Great Demon.

446
00:29:23,480 --> 00:29:24,480
The Great Demon

447
00:29:51,480 --> 00:29:52,480
It's you.

448
00:29:53,480 --> 00:29:54,480
I see you again.

449
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:11,480
No.

450
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:13,480
These are not humans.

451
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:16,480
They are not demons.

452
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:19,480
These are...

453
00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:21,480
These are...

454
00:30:23,480 --> 00:30:24,480
These are...

455
00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:27,480
Ying Lei,

456
00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:29,480
after you.

457
00:30:53,480 --> 00:30:54,480
The Great Demon

458
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:25,480
The Great Demon

459
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:27,480
Yu Lin

460
00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:29,480
is the one who will protect you.

461
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:31,480
Protect Yu Lin?

462
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:39,480
The Yu Lin of the Dark Shadow

463
00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:41,480
is very useful.

464
00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:43,480
Maybe I can use it

465
00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:45,480
to develop a new spirit.

466
00:31:47,480 --> 00:31:48,480
It's useful.

467
00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:55,480
As for Yu Lin,

468
00:31:56,480 --> 00:31:57,480
I see you again.

469
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:01,480
It can be a secret weapon.

470
00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:04,480
And something even better.

471
00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:05,480
Good thing.

472
00:32:05,480 --> 00:32:06,480
I've seen a demon

473
00:32:07,480 --> 00:32:08,480
called Heng Gong Yu.

474
00:32:09,480 --> 00:32:10,480
He is a phoenix.

475
00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:11,480
He is like a steel.

476
00:32:11,480 --> 00:32:12,480
He is powerful.

477
00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:13,480
It sounds

478
00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:15,480
suitable for a開-air.

479
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:25,480
没 изsee.

480
00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:50,480
The Red Arrow Aftersecund is ready.

481
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:52,480
The High Brushing Rock Will Be designer.

482
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:54,480
Is it true?

483
00:32:57,840 --> 00:33:00,840
What you said is a big drug.

484
00:33:01,840 --> 00:33:03,040
But they are people.

485
00:33:03,040 --> 00:33:03,920
Are you crazy?

486
00:33:03,920 --> 00:33:04,920
They are people!

487
00:33:13,880 --> 00:33:16,880
Zhu Yin, why did you do this?

488
00:33:18,840 --> 00:33:21,480
Because he and I have the same goal.

489
00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:25,120
What I mentioned is not right.

490
00:33:25,480 --> 00:33:26,440
What is your plan?

491
00:33:27,640 --> 00:33:28,760
Yin Zhao...

492
00:33:29,040 --> 00:33:29,960
It's been some time.

493
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:54,980
...

494
00:33:54,980 --> 00:33:57,760
...

495
00:33:58,260 --> 00:34:10,880
...

496
00:34:12,780 --> 00:34:19,820
...

497
00:34:23,460 --> 00:34:24,220
Zhu Yan.

498
00:34:25,420 --> 00:34:26,720
You're a policeman,

499
00:34:27,840 --> 00:34:30,240
you are not the iron to lose from the ghoulhaps with laylimits.

500
00:34:32,520 --> 00:34:34,180
淑郎淑辈.

501
00:34:36,560 --> 00:34:45,860
Even

502
00:34:45,860 --> 00:34:48,620
Your safe действies

503
00:34:48,620 --> 00:34:49,160
are to remember

504
00:34:49,160 --> 00:34:51,400
and you are a devoted diseases.

505
00:34:52,480 --> 00:34:57,480
Your goal is to let the Great Emperor destroy you.

506
00:34:57,480 --> 00:35:00,480
To let the Demon Father die, right?

507
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:02,480
You're wrong.

508
00:35:02,480 --> 00:35:05,480
It's to let all the lives of the Great Emperor

509
00:35:05,480 --> 00:35:08,480
be free to come to the two realms.

510
00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:10,480
Not to be trapped in the world

511
00:35:10,480 --> 00:35:14,480
and to be bewildered.

512
00:35:23,480 --> 00:35:34,480
How the Ocean Skoggles

513
00:35:34,480 --> 00:35:38,480
is embedded

514
00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:45,120
in your bloodshed

515
00:35:45,720 --> 00:35:45,920
With hismans

516
00:35:45,940 --> 00:35:46,520
Salute Cosmos

517
00:35:46,540 --> 00:35:46,940
ilda

518
00:35:46,980 --> 00:35:47,480
Prometheus

519
00:35:47,500 --> 00:35:48,720
The same color blue

520
00:35:48,820 --> 00:35:49,320
As the time flies

521
00:35:49,340 --> 00:35:51,820
The demon show

522
00:35:56,420 --> 00:35:56,820
He said

523
00:36:00,740 --> 00:36:01,780
Far from flying

524
00:36:01,980 --> 00:36:05,220
moon

525
00:36:05,220 --> 00:36:06,020
But we have to

526
00:36:06,200 --> 00:36:07,840
take off the dress

527
00:36:07,900 --> 00:36:10,020
since you and I are a little short

528
00:36:10,020 --> 00:36:10,880
Hello my father

529
00:36:10,900 --> 00:36:12,240
any random

530
00:36:12,340 --> 00:36:13,380
i

531
00:36:13,380 --> 00:36:15,380
I'm here to help you.

532
00:36:15,380 --> 00:36:17,380
Do you know what this is?

533
00:36:17,380 --> 00:36:21,380
This is the mountain god, Zhu Yin.

534
00:36:23,380 --> 00:36:25,380
I know.

535
00:36:25,380 --> 00:36:27,380
Zhu Yin is Zhu Long, right?

536
00:36:27,380 --> 00:36:29,380
Everyone says Zhu Long is great.

537
00:36:29,380 --> 00:36:31,380
He's the one who is the most powerful,

538
00:36:31,380 --> 00:36:33,380
who is the most powerful,

539
00:36:33,380 --> 00:36:35,380
who is the most powerful,

540
00:36:35,380 --> 00:36:37,380
who is the most powerful,

541
00:36:37,380 --> 00:36:39,380
who is the most powerful,

542
00:36:39,380 --> 00:36:41,380
who is the most powerful,

543
00:36:41,380 --> 00:36:43,380
who is the most powerful,

544
00:36:43,380 --> 00:36:45,380
but I can't control you.

545
00:36:45,380 --> 00:36:47,380
Can you be a precious person?

546
00:36:47,380 --> 00:36:51,380
I didn't ask Zhu Long to let me be a great person.

547
00:36:51,380 --> 00:36:55,380
Reading the holy book is just to show myself to the public.

548
00:36:55,380 --> 00:36:57,380
Don't be self-loving.

549
00:36:57,380 --> 00:36:59,380
You're sitting here in a temple,

550
00:36:59,380 --> 00:37:01,380
and you're always in the middle of the day.

551
00:37:01,380 --> 00:37:03,380
You may not understand.

552
00:37:03,380 --> 00:37:05,380
You should go down the mountain to see.

553
00:37:05,380 --> 00:37:07,380
If you don't want to go down the mountain to see me,

554
00:37:07,380 --> 00:37:11,380
I'll live in the house under the tree in the west.

555
00:37:23,380 --> 00:37:27,380
What's the benefit of giving you a theory?

556
00:37:27,380 --> 00:37:29,380
There's no need to benefit.

557
00:37:29,380 --> 00:37:33,380
I'm one of his targets.

558
00:37:33,380 --> 00:37:35,380
The medicine is the medicine.

559
00:37:35,380 --> 00:37:39,380
It's impossible to be recognized by the mortal.

560
00:37:41,380 --> 00:37:43,380
What did you add in the tea?

561
00:37:43,380 --> 00:37:45,380
Why did you harm me?

562
00:37:57,380 --> 00:37:59,380
You didn't say that

563
00:37:59,380 --> 00:38:03,380
I was trying to make myself understand the world.

564
00:38:03,380 --> 00:38:07,380
I was trying to make myself understand the world.

565
00:38:07,380 --> 00:38:09,380
I was trying to make myself understand the world.

566
00:38:09,380 --> 00:38:11,380
But you're a demon.

567
00:38:19,380 --> 00:38:23,380
Why are you being taken away by them?

568
00:38:23,380 --> 00:38:27,380

00:38:48,380 --> 00:38:51,380
You ruined their family?

576
00:38:51,380 --> 00:38:54,380
It's because they're cowardly and cowardly.

577
00:38:54,380 --> 00:38:57,380
They don't want to be separated from their family.

578
00:38:58,380 --> 00:39:00,380
Master,

579
00:39:01,380 --> 00:39:03,380
