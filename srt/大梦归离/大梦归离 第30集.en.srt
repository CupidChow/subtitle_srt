2
00:01:43,130 --> 00:01:46,009
[Episode 30]

3
00:01:46,630 --> 00:01:48,080
You are really pitiful.

4
00:01:48,789 --> 00:01:51,390
You are the loneliest person in the world.

5
00:02:57,950 --> 00:03:00,900
My unique talent I'm proud of

6
00:03:01,310 --> 00:03:04,230
can be easily seen through

7
00:03:04,270 --> 00:03:05,980
by your Truth Eye.

8
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:09,120
A destined enemy like you

9
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:12,320
is so boring.

10
00:03:15,750 --> 00:03:17,960
I shall give you the Truth Eye.

11
00:03:18,470 --> 00:03:19,530
In this way,

12
00:03:19,670 --> 00:03:22,590
no one in the world can see through you.

13
00:03:22,970 --> 00:03:24,160
Zhu Yan.

14
00:03:25,610 --> 00:03:27,290
Won't you regret it?

15
00:03:29,010 --> 00:03:30,270
How long has it been

16
00:03:30,660 --> 00:03:32,630
since we played Go so peacefully

17
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,940
as we are now?

18
00:03:36,430 --> 00:03:37,660
I don't remember anymore.

19
00:03:43,430 --> 00:03:44,370
Indeed.

20
00:03:47,180 --> 00:03:48,260
Some things

21
00:03:49,420 --> 00:03:51,170
are better forgotten.

22
00:03:51,530 --> 00:03:53,020
Sacrificing a pawn to gain an advantage,

23
00:03:53,670 --> 00:03:54,790
advancing step by step with careful strategy.

24
00:03:56,460 --> 00:03:58,660
In the end, you only took one piece.

25
00:04:00,150 --> 00:04:01,570
Is this fun?

26
00:04:03,590 --> 00:04:05,960
As expected, after staying with humans for a long time,

27
00:04:07,100 --> 00:04:08,830
you start

28
00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:11,550
beating around the bush too.

29
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:15,030
Life is like chess.

30
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:17,870
If you were wrong right from the start...

31
00:04:17,950 --> 00:04:20,269
Life is like chess?

32
00:04:22,980 --> 00:04:24,990
But I don't want to be a human.

33
00:04:28,270 --> 00:04:30,100
You are the one

34
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:33,310
who wants to be human.

35
00:04:34,130 --> 00:04:36,050
One of us

36
00:04:36,470 --> 00:04:38,060
will lose,

37
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:40,750
and the other will win.

38
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:44,250
We can draw too.

39
00:04:48,590 --> 00:04:49,750
Draw?

40
00:04:53,540 --> 00:04:55,200
You said it yourself.

41
00:05:03,020 --> 00:05:04,700
We can draw.

42
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:07,100
I don't mind being the best with you.

43
00:05:07,310 --> 00:05:09,240
You still have a chance to make up for it.

44
00:05:13,540 --> 00:05:14,690
How?

45
00:05:17,850 --> 00:05:19,730
Leave Bai Jiu's body

46
00:05:23,810 --> 00:05:25,320
and let him live.

47
00:05:33,020 --> 00:05:34,040
Zhu Yan.

48
00:05:38,070 --> 00:05:40,130
Your peace resolution

49
00:05:42,150 --> 00:05:44,420
is for me to die?

50
00:05:47,540 --> 00:05:49,420
He is your friend.

51
00:05:52,350 --> 00:05:53,730
I was

52
00:05:55,420 --> 00:05:57,260
your friend too.

53
00:06:45,190 --> 00:06:45,890
Zhao Yuanzhou.

54
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:46,640
What's wrong?

55
00:06:46,670 --> 00:06:47,270
Great Demon!

56
00:06:53,290 --> 00:06:54,400
Great Demon?

57
00:06:55,860 --> 00:06:58,180
He has lost all his demonic power.

58
00:06:59,159 --> 00:07:01,360
He's no different from a human.

59
00:07:04,310 --> 00:07:05,420
Your demonic power...

60
00:07:06,190 --> 00:07:08,370
Was it to rebuild the Cloud Light Sword for me?

61
00:07:09,750 --> 00:07:10,550
No.

62
00:07:12,270 --> 00:07:13,870
I'm here to save Bai Jiu.

63
00:07:15,010 --> 00:07:16,240
Zhao Yuanzhou...

64
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:19,960
You made yourself such a mess.

65
00:07:21,510 --> 00:07:23,630
You don't deserve to be my opponent anymore.

66
00:07:25,150 --> 00:07:25,950
Li Lun.

67
00:07:27,260 --> 00:07:28,350
Your opponent

68
00:07:29,230 --> 00:07:30,110
is me.

69
00:07:30,580 --> 00:07:31,640
Zhuo!

70
00:07:39,150 --> 00:07:40,330
Zhao Yuanzhou.

71
00:07:41,650 --> 00:07:42,659
Lord Bai Yan,

72
00:07:42,690 --> 00:07:43,750
I'll leave it to you.

73
00:07:43,780 --> 00:07:44,680
Goddess,

74
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:45,780
I will protect you.

75
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:04,360
With a human's body...

76
00:08:04,730 --> 00:08:06,300
That's seeking death.

77
00:08:38,419 --> 00:08:39,429
Heng.

78
00:09:08,110 --> 00:09:10,260
Bingyi Sword Technique is indeed powerful.

79
00:09:11,590 --> 00:09:13,580
But you don't dare to hurt me.

80
00:09:13,700 --> 00:09:15,390
By avoiding the vital parts,

81
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:18,360
you will lose.

82
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:43,060
Wen Xiao!

83
00:09:43,250 --> 00:09:44,780
The poison in your body hasn't been eliminated.

84
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:46,010
Don't force it!

85
00:10:08,570 --> 00:10:09,480
Wen Xiao.

86
00:10:14,330 --> 00:10:15,840
We must control him.

87
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:20,590
Otherwise Zhuo can't take away Li Lun's spirit.

88
00:10:21,150 --> 00:10:22,830
If anything goes wrong,

89
00:10:23,140 --> 00:10:25,760
both Li Lun and Jiu will perish.

90
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:13,450
Wen Xiao.

91
00:12:17,430 --> 00:12:18,300
What are you afraid of?

92
00:12:18,530 --> 00:12:19,470
I'm here.

93
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:20,340
Let's go!

94
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:24,470
J...

95
00:12:26,310 --> 00:12:27,410
Jiu...

96
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,060
Jiu!

97
00:12:50,590 --> 00:12:51,540
I was not used to

98
00:12:52,940 --> 00:12:54,340
not having you around.

99
00:13:12,510 --> 00:13:13,440
Ying Lei!

100
00:13:15,750 --> 00:13:17,690
Mr. Zhuo!

101
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:55,970
The root of the pagoda tree...

102
00:13:58,570 --> 00:14:01,410
I gave you my Truth Eye.

103
00:14:03,460 --> 00:14:06,060
You gave me the root of your pagoda tree.

104
00:14:08,230 --> 00:14:10,220
We used to be best friends,

105
00:14:11,670 --> 00:14:13,710
but now we've turned against each other.

106
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:20,550
The pagoda tree is your primordial tree.

107
00:14:21,250 --> 00:14:24,030
If you remove your inner core from Bai Jiu's body

108
00:14:24,970 --> 00:14:26,690
and lead it to the root of the pagoda tree,

109
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:28,740
after you cultivate for a hundred years,

110
00:14:29,330 --> 00:14:31,970
you can still take human form.

111
00:14:36,190 --> 00:14:39,050
Zhao Yuanzhou still doesn't want your soul to disappear.

112
00:14:40,190 --> 00:14:42,480
This is his last mercy to you.

113
00:14:53,340 --> 00:14:54,390
Promise me

114
00:14:57,890 --> 00:14:59,690
to spare his life.

115
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:11,800
♫Laugh at the chaotic world's illusion, like flowers in the mirror and moonlight on water♫

116
00:15:06,220 --> 00:15:07,220
Tell him...

117
00:15:11,910 --> 00:15:18,060
♫Can't let go and turn back, the sea of ​​suffering is endless♫

118
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:24,970
♫No fear and no worries, there is always a home at the end of the world♫

119
00:15:25,180 --> 00:15:31,500
♫Warm the scars along the way with the sunset♫

120
00:15:31,610 --> 00:15:38,470
♫Without worries, the dark night brings me home♫

121
00:15:38,530 --> 00:15:44,740
♫Don't fear; will the starlight remember me?♫

122
00:15:40,230 --> 00:15:41,740
I did it.

123
00:15:53,390 --> 00:15:54,060
Ying Lei.

124
00:15:54,350 --> 00:15:55,460
Jiu is fine.

125
00:15:55,520 --> 00:15:56,830
Pass him to me.

126
00:16:19,110 --> 00:16:20,240
Little girl,

127
00:16:20,460 --> 00:16:21,870
the temple is a solemn place.

128
00:16:21,950 --> 00:16:22,940
Please be quiet.

129
00:16:23,070 --> 00:16:24,560
Who are you calling Little Girl?

130
00:16:24,750 --> 00:16:26,730
Go take some medicine if you're blind!

131
00:16:27,750 --> 00:16:28,830
Why is your name

132
00:16:28,830 --> 00:16:29,550
Bai Jiu?

133
00:16:29,710 --> 00:16:32,330
Why not Yellow Wine or Hua Tiao?

134
00:16:45,080 --> 00:16:46,640
Mr. Zhuo...

135
00:17:21,069 --> 00:17:21,670
Ying Lei.

136
00:17:30,260 --> 00:17:31,500
Mr. Zhuo...

137
00:17:35,020 --> 00:17:36,250
Jiu...

138
00:17:38,740 --> 00:17:40,320
admires you the most.

139
00:17:45,130 --> 00:17:46,730
This time,

140
00:17:46,760 --> 00:17:47,490
it was me...

141
00:17:47,730 --> 00:17:49,380
who saved him...

142
00:18:02,110 --> 00:18:03,500
Mountain God.

143
00:18:07,550 --> 00:18:09,070
You're amazing.

144
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:19,010
I like...

145
00:18:21,990 --> 00:18:24,150
hearing Mr. Zhuo...

146
00:18:32,280 --> 00:18:33,320
calling me

147
00:18:33,380 --> 00:18:34,720
amazing...

148
00:18:37,590 --> 00:18:38,150
Jiu.

149
00:18:38,150 --> 00:18:39,330
You're amazing.

150
00:18:39,630 --> 00:18:40,820
What about me?

151
00:18:41,010 --> 00:18:42,770
Shouldn't you praise me?

152
00:18:45,260 --> 00:18:46,610
Mountain God Ying Lei,

153
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:47,840
you're amazing too.

154
00:19:03,540 --> 00:19:05,160
You're more amazing than I am.

155
00:19:11,620 --> 00:19:14,010
You're the hero who saved Jiu.

156
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:29,210
You are the best

157
00:19:30,250 --> 00:19:31,470
mountain god

158
00:19:32,310 --> 00:19:34,270
I've ever seen.

159
00:19:36,020 --> 00:19:38,840
You're also the best cook.

160
00:20:05,670 --> 00:20:06,470
Jiu.

161
00:20:08,310 --> 00:20:09,350
You'll surely become

162
00:20:10,290 --> 00:20:12,150
the best physician in the world.

163
00:20:13,500 --> 00:20:14,550
Go for it.

164
00:20:21,110 --> 00:20:22,150
Jiu...

165
00:20:25,530 --> 00:20:27,510
You'll surely become

166
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:29,390
the greatest

167
00:20:29,420 --> 00:20:30,330
phy...

168
00:20:30,780 --> 00:20:32,520
physician...

169
00:20:34,830 --> 00:20:35,720
in the world...

170
00:20:42,990 --> 00:20:44,420
Monster! Monster!

171
00:20:46,470 --> 00:20:47,630
Little Mountain God!

172
00:20:48,390 --> 00:20:49,550
Ying Lei!

173
00:20:50,230 --> 00:20:50,870
Ying Lei.

174
00:20:50,870 --> 00:20:51,740
I'm ready.

175
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,000
Are you coming?

176
00:20:53,150 --> 00:20:53,750
Let's go.

177
00:21:14,710 --> 00:21:15,790
Mr. Zhuo...

178
00:21:25,020 --> 00:21:26,200
I want to

179
00:21:26,530 --> 00:21:28,400
stay with

180
00:21:29,830 --> 00:21:32,390
everyone.

181
00:21:33,750 --> 00:21:34,510
I'm...

182
00:21:35,950 --> 00:21:37,710
scared.

183
00:23:26,310 --> 00:23:31,600
♫Has anyone seen a bird with a broken tail?♫

184
00:23:31,860 --> 00:23:36,400
♫The rain wet its feathers♫

185
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:43,750
♫There're no worries in its eyes♫

186
00:23:43,820 --> 00:23:49,280
♫It just wants to sleep on a roof♫

187
00:24:19,280 --> 00:24:20,290
Jiu.

188
00:24:23,710 --> 00:24:24,520
Mom.

189
00:24:34,310 --> 00:24:35,190
Mom.

190
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:38,450
I'm sorry.

191
00:24:40,190 --> 00:24:41,940
I made you wait for a long time.

192
00:24:46,820 --> 00:24:47,850
Mom.

193
00:25:07,850 --> 00:25:09,620
We can draw.

194
00:25:25,830 --> 00:25:27,140
Li Lun

195
00:25:27,210 --> 00:25:28,560
left this message

196
00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:30,720
for you.

197
00:25:32,730 --> 00:25:34,140
Tell him...

198
00:25:36,990 --> 00:25:38,240
this time...

199
00:25:42,970 --> 00:25:44,380
This time...

200
00:25:45,490 --> 00:25:47,560
we draw.

201
00:26:02,200 --> 00:26:04,090
Why didn't you tell us?

202
00:26:04,630 --> 00:26:06,620
After you forged the sword with Ever-Burning Wood,

203
00:26:07,110 --> 00:26:08,810
you've lost all your demonic power.

204
00:26:09,660 --> 00:26:11,260
Would saying it

205
00:26:12,070 --> 00:26:13,110
make a difference?

206
00:26:15,080 --> 00:26:16,930
This sword must be cultivated.

207
00:26:17,770 --> 00:26:20,120
Wen Xiao risked her life for this.

208
00:26:20,530 --> 00:26:22,310
So what if I don't have

209
00:26:22,910 --> 00:26:24,070
my demonic power anymore?

210
00:26:24,990 --> 00:26:27,270
But you're worse than a human now.

211
00:26:28,280 --> 00:26:29,760
Normal people

212
00:26:29,790 --> 00:26:31,440
are not that weak.

213
00:26:32,270 --> 00:26:33,310
Look.

214
00:26:34,160 --> 00:26:35,400
I didn't want to tell you

215
00:26:35,430 --> 00:26:37,830
because I don't want to see you like this.

216
00:26:39,510 --> 00:26:41,830
Every generation of the Bingyi Clan is the God of War.

217
00:26:42,220 --> 00:26:44,870
But your gaze is so resentful right now.

218
00:26:45,190 --> 00:26:47,160
If your Bingyi ancestors see it,

219
00:26:47,390 --> 00:26:49,530
they'll beat you to death.

220
00:26:49,710 --> 00:26:51,230
What are you talking about?

221
00:26:53,780 --> 00:26:55,630
I'm more used to

222
00:26:56,910 --> 00:26:58,210
hearing you scold me.

223
00:27:11,750 --> 00:27:12,670
Let's go.

224
00:28:02,270 --> 00:28:03,210
Ying Lei!

225
00:28:04,830 --> 00:28:05,720
Ying Lei!

226
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:07,750
Ying Lei!

227
00:28:07,350 --> 00:28:13,400
♫Someday I'll return to my old hometown♫

228
00:28:14,250 --> 00:28:20,290
♫Wearing old clothes but with eyes shining bright♫

229
00:28:15,750 --> 00:28:16,600
Ying Lei.

230
00:28:18,750 --> 00:28:19,550
Ying Lei!

231
00:28:21,180 --> 00:28:23,170
♫Holding brilliance in the right hand♫

232
00:28:21,410 --> 00:28:22,610
Ying Lei.

233
00:28:23,210 --> 00:28:25,130
♫Biting down on all panic♫

234
00:28:23,310 --> 00:28:24,430
Ying Lei!

235
00:28:25,150 --> 00:28:26,630
♫Wiping away frost with the left hand♫

236
00:28:26,670 --> 00:28:28,480
♫I finally look up♫

237
00:28:28,510 --> 00:28:31,360
♫You're in front of me♫

238
00:28:29,080 --> 00:28:30,130
Ying Lei!

239
00:28:32,250 --> 00:28:34,410
♫Blocking the pain♫

240
00:28:35,130 --> 00:28:38,450
♫Who cries with swollen eyes?♫

241
00:28:35,190 --> 00:28:36,140
Ying Lei!

242
00:28:36,660 --> 00:28:37,490
Ying Lei!

243
00:28:39,070 --> 00:28:41,920
♫With a broken heart♫

244
00:28:39,300 --> 00:28:40,330
Ying Lei!

245
00:28:40,440 --> 00:28:41,310
Ying Lei!

246
00:28:42,050 --> 00:28:44,950
♫Walking, stopping♫

247
00:28:44,150 --> 00:28:44,940
Jiu.

248
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:47,910
♫Chasing your voice♫

249
00:28:48,450 --> 00:28:52,100
♫I'll turn into raindrops♫

250
00:28:52,380 --> 00:28:55,050

♫Running towards you♫

♫The summer cicadas also hear♫

254
00:29:06,410 --> 00:29:09,200
♫The winter snow also hears♫

255
00:29:09,540 --> 00:29:12,120
♫In a sea of people♫

256
00:29:12,500 --> 00:29:15,530
♫I'm holding a small wind chime♫

257
00:29:15,960 --> 00:29:19,410
♫I finally heard the wind say♫

258
00:29:19,790 --> 00:29:22,630
♫Knowing where you are♫

259
00:29:22,810 --> 00:29:25,710
♫It'll lead me♫

260
00:29:26,190 --> 00:29:29,070
♫To find you♫

261
00:29:29,650 --> 00:29:32,300
♫Find you♫

262
00:29:35,710 --> 00:29:36,510
Jiu.

263
00:29:36,410 --> 00:29:38,800
♫Find you♫

264
00:29:37,350 --> 00:29:38,780
Cry if you want.

265
00:29:38,910 --> 00:29:39,910
I'll be with you.

266
00:29:42,400 --> 00:29:43,150
Tears

267
00:29:43,310 --> 00:29:44,590
have nothing to do with age

268
00:29:45,630 --> 00:29:46,910
and nothing to do with strength or weakness.

269
00:29:48,410 --> 00:29:50,320
It has something to do with our hearts.

270
00:29:51,910 --> 00:29:53,020
Humans are soft-hearted.

271
00:29:55,150 --> 00:29:56,690
Soft things

272
00:29:57,510 --> 00:30:00,720
will always be pricked by something hard and cold.

273
00:30:02,100 --> 00:30:03,240
Death

274
00:30:04,260 --> 00:30:05,670
is the hardest and coldest thing

275
00:30:05,710 --> 00:30:08,250
in this world.

276
00:30:12,190 --> 00:30:15,070
Ying Lei asked me to bring this to you.

277
00:30:16,110 --> 00:30:17,070
I brought it.

278
00:30:18,440 --> 00:30:19,920
Ying Lei left it for me?

279
00:30:19,950 --> 00:30:20,630
Yes.

280
00:30:30,770 --> 00:30:31,890
It looks like

281
00:30:32,370 --> 00:30:33,880
almond cheese.

282
00:30:36,750 --> 00:30:39,420
My mom's almond cheese is better.

283
00:30:39,990 --> 00:30:40,990
Almond cheese?

284
00:30:41,510 --> 00:30:42,150
Yes.

285
00:30:42,150 --> 00:30:43,140
Got it.

286
00:30:47,160 --> 00:30:48,730
This little cook

287
00:30:50,070 --> 00:30:51,620
is really a fool.

288
00:30:53,460 --> 00:30:54,990
Who makes a whole pickle jar

289
00:30:54,990 --> 00:30:56,200
of almond cheese?

290
00:30:56,670 --> 00:30:58,140
It'll spoil in just a few days.

291
00:31:14,430 --> 00:31:15,360
Ying Lei.

292
00:31:16,800 --> 00:31:18,310
Are you making pomegranate wine again?

293
00:31:18,730 --> 00:31:19,840
No.

294
00:31:19,990 --> 00:31:22,170
It's almond cheese.

295
00:31:23,190 --> 00:31:24,640
Silly kid.

296
00:31:24,950 --> 00:31:25,990
It'll spoil

297
00:31:26,030 --> 00:31:27,140
if you make so many.

298
00:31:28,390 --> 00:31:30,290
I'll just use some spells.

299
00:31:30,310 --> 00:31:31,730
I've figured it out.

300
00:31:32,760 --> 00:31:34,900
No wonder your grandpa always scolds you.

301
00:31:35,310 --> 00:31:36,830
He said you always use your power

302
00:31:36,830 --> 00:31:38,750
on unimportant things.

303
00:31:38,870 --> 00:31:40,150
Who said it's not important?

304
00:31:40,230 --> 00:31:41,500
It's very important.

305
00:31:43,720 --> 00:31:44,910
My grandpa never understood

306
00:31:44,950 --> 00:31:46,820
why I want to be a cook.

307
00:31:47,100 --> 00:31:48,960
That's because he seldom goes to the mortal world.

308
00:31:50,300 --> 00:31:52,880
Behind every favorite dish,

309
00:31:52,900 --> 00:31:55,090
there is someone who cares about you the most.

310
00:31:55,120 --> 00:31:56,150
One's mother,

311
00:31:56,720 --> 00:31:57,510
brother,

312
00:31:57,810 --> 00:31:58,920
lover,

313
00:31:59,710 --> 00:32:00,680
and friend.

314
00:32:01,800 --> 00:32:03,550
Only those who cherish you the most

315
00:32:03,710 --> 00:32:05,750
will always cook the same dish for you.

316
00:32:05,770 --> 00:32:07,040
I heard that

317
00:32:07,120 --> 00:32:08,510
all homesickness

318
00:32:08,790 --> 00:32:10,620
can be turned into a dish.

319
00:32:11,780 --> 00:32:13,170
It can tug on your stomach

320
00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:15,730
and your heart.

321
00:32:16,770 --> 00:32:18,640
So that when you wander around,

322
00:32:19,550 --> 00:32:21,030
you always want to go home.

323
00:32:21,590 --> 00:32:22,650
When Jiu comes back

324
00:32:22,750 --> 00:32:24,120
and eats the almond cheese

325
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:26,700
his mom made for him the most,

326
00:32:27,410 --> 00:32:28,750
he must be very happy.

327
00:32:34,430 --> 00:32:39,670
♫Has anyone seen a bird with a broken tail?♫

328
00:32:38,030 --> 00:32:39,560
Give it to him yourself.

329
00:32:39,720 --> 00:32:44,890
♫It uses starlight as its feathers♫

330
00:32:39,800 --> 00:32:41,030
Why are you giving it to me?

331
00:32:46,730 --> 00:32:51,860
♫Snowflakes on the corners of its eyes♫

332
00:32:52,100 --> 00:32:57,330
♫It doesn't cry for years♫

333
00:32:58,190 --> 00:33:01,030

♫Lonely eyes can't make it through the dawn♫

336
00:33:10,310 --> 00:33:13,880
♫Time is quiet♫

337
00:33:14,280 --> 00:33:16,620
♫And noisy at the same time♫

♫How many are the fallen flowers?♫

339
00:33:19,660 --> 00:33:21,330
I don't listen to my grandpa.

340
00:33:22,150 --> 00:33:24,270
But my grandpa has a good saying.

341

Ying Lei,

344
00:33:28,110 --> 00:33:31,190
if you want to be the best cook in the world,

345
00:33:29,260 --> 00:33:34,280
♫A heartbeat of cold and heat♫

346
00:33:31,660 --> 00:33:34,050
you need to know all kinds of flavors.

♫The world is beautiful♫

349
00:33:36,510 --> 00:33:38,010
two places on a human body

350
00:33:38,270 --> 00:33:40,390
that can taste.

351
00:33:38,600 --> 00:33:41,110
♫But troubled♫

352
00:33:41,510 --> 00:33:42,960
One is the tongue,

353
00:33:42,020 --> 00:33:46,310
♫It's going home♫

354
00:33:43,750 --> 00:33:44,760
the other

355
00:33:47,150 --> 00:33:48,070
is the heart.

356
00:33:48,100 --> 00:33:52,570
♫I'm going home♫

357
00:34:10,110 --> 00:34:10,949
Sister Pei.

358
00:34:12,400 --> 00:34:14,889
Are you sad about Ying Lei's death?

359
00:34:16,659 --> 00:34:17,949
I'm not sad.

360
00:34:20,770 --> 00:34:22,020
I'm blaming myself.

361
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:26,420
If I could be stronger

362
00:34:27,449 --> 00:34:28,909
and more powerful,

363
00:34:29,679 --> 00:34:32,199
maybe Ying Lei wouldn't have died.

364
00:34:33,620 --> 00:34:35,500
I'm also a human.

365
00:34:35,980 --> 00:34:37,370
So is Zhuo.

366
00:34:38,570 --> 00:34:40,190
But we

367
00:34:40,690 --> 00:34:42,440
are all indispensable.

368
00:34:45,510 --> 00:34:47,310
You’re the Baize Goddess.

369
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:50,239
Mr. Zhuo is from the Bingyi bloodline.

370
00:34:50,550 --> 00:34:51,830
I'm the only

371
00:34:54,170 --> 00:34:56,580
most useless mortal.

372
00:34:57,800 --> 00:34:59,670
I couldn't save Jiu

373
00:35:05,990 --> 00:35:07,900
nor Ying Lei.

374
00:35:17,560 --> 00:35:20,960
Now I even need my brother's puppet to protect me.

375
00:35:22,670 --> 00:35:24,820
If you hadn't protected me,

376
00:35:25,610 --> 00:35:26,880
I would have died.

377
00:35:27,930 --> 00:35:30,410
No one can protect everyone.

378
00:35:32,720 --> 00:35:34,140
Great Demon is so strong.

379
00:35:35,100 --> 00:35:37,280
He needs us sometimes.

380
00:35:38,770 --> 00:35:40,710
He wouldn't need me.

381
00:35:43,940 --> 00:35:45,350
But I need you.

382
00:36:07,390 --> 00:36:09,470
Before you know how to protect others,

383
00:36:10,710 --> 00:36:12,910
you have to learn to protect yourself first.

384
00:36:14,710 --> 00:36:15,750
Got it?

385
00:36:16,790 --> 00:36:18,510
Brother Zhuo will protect me.

386
00:36:27,480 --> 00:36:29,160
Maybe after this,

387
00:36:30,380 --> 00:36:31,180
I...

388
00:36:31,280 --> 00:36:32,380
Brother Zhuo.

389
00:36:32,870 --> 00:36:34,130
What did you say?

390
00:36:37,800 --> 00:36:39,530
I said you're a skilled doctor.

391
00:36:40,090 --> 00:36:42,390
You should know how to protect and take care of

392
00:36:42,410 --> 00:36:44,980
these friends around you who've been through thick and thin with you.

393
00:36:46,120 --> 00:36:47,500
Of course.

394
00:36:48,040 --> 00:36:50,370
I'm confident in this.

395
00:36:56,050 --> 00:36:57,770
Especially Wen.

396
00:37:01,220 --> 00:37:02,730
She's unlucky.

397
00:37:05,730 --> 00:37:07,820
She's always riddled with troubles and illness.

398
00:37:10,950 --> 00:37:13,000
Take care of her health.

399
00:37:14,690 --> 00:37:16,330
As for Ms. Pei,

400
00:37:17,150 --> 00:37:19,290
she can take care of herself,

401
00:37:22,430 --> 00:37:24,170
but she sometimes acts tough

402
00:37:26,250 --> 00:37:27,590
and would feel inferior.

403
00:37:30,310 --> 00:37:31,740
And Zhao Yuanzhou...

404
00:37:32,660 --> 00:37:33,960
Wait.

405
00:37:34,830 --> 00:37:35,750
Brother Zhuo.

406
00:37:37,910 --> 00:37:39,150
Why do I feel

407
00:37:39,180 --> 00:37:40,900
you're acting weird today?

408
00:37:42,680 --> 00:37:43,760
Maybe

409
00:37:47,110 --> 00:37:49,110
the departure of Little Mountain God

410
00:37:51,630 --> 00:37:53,830
made me cherish you more.

411
00:38:02,230 --> 00:38:04,030
Can the poison on Wen Xiao

412
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:06,480
really not be eliminated?

413
00:38:08,360 --> 00:38:10,250
There is no antidote at all.

414
00:38:12,100 --> 00:38:14,620
Unless someone is willing to use their demonic power

415
00:38:14,640 --> 00:38:16,680
to absorb the poison into their own body.

416
00:38:22,100 --> 00:38:23,940
That's what he said.

417
00:38:31,320 --> 00:38:32,450
Looks like

418
00:38:33,760 --> 00:38:36,270
we can only find another way.

419
00:38:38,240 --> 00:38:39,150
Ao Yin

420
00:38:39,900 --> 00:38:42,320
transferred the poison in his body away with demonic power.

421
00:38:45,260 --> 00:38:46,430
She transferred it away?

422
00:38:50,080 --> 00:38:51,330
Don't tell

423
00:38:52,310 --> 00:38:54,000
Mr. Zhuo about this.

424
00:39:00,200 --> 00:39:01,370
I understand.

425
00:39:02,720 --> 00:39:04,080
But Wen Xiao

426
00:39:04,910 --> 00:39:06,860
won't let you do that.

427
00:39:07,220 --> 00:39:09,740
♫A lone boat drifts through the world♫

428
