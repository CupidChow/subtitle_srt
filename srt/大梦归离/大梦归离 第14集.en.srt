00:10:46,950 --> 00:10:48,350
Even if you offer to sing,

170
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:50,610
no one would dare to listen.

171
00:10:57,670 --> 00:10:59,070
Why are you looking at me?

172
00:10:59,670 --> 00:11:02,180
I heard that you're great at sword dancing,

173
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:03,400
Mr. Zhuo.

174
00:11:03,640 --> 00:11:05,240
Why don't you perform for us?

175
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:07,020
Perform for us.

176
00:11:08,350 --> 00:11:09,060
This...

177
00:11:10,830 --> 00:11:11,630
Brother Zhuo.

178
00:11:11,670 --> 00:11:12,630
Perform for us.

179
00:11:12,790 --> 00:11:13,470
Mr. Zhuo.

180
00:11:13,470 --> 00:11:14,110
Perform for us.

181
00:11:14,110 --> 00:11:14,970
Perform for us.

182
00:11:15,110 --> 00:11:16,640
Brother Zhuo, dance for us.

183
00:11:16,960 --> 00:11:17,940
Okay...

184
00:11:18,710 --> 00:11:19,350
Hey.

185
00:11:19,570 --> 00:11:21,100
I think we should forget it.

186
00:11:21,470 --> 00:11:23,970
Mr. Zhuo is normally a no-nonsense person.

187
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:25,400
It's too much

188
00:11:25,430 --> 00:11:27,320
to ask him to perform for us.

189
00:11:38,500 --> 00:11:39,440
Here it comes.

190
00:11:39,460 --> 00:11:41,060
I can perform sword dancing.

191
00:11:41,550 --> 00:11:42,410
Zhao Yuanzhou.

192
00:11:42,540 --> 00:11:44,020
You're not young anymore.

193
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:46,100
You should get up and exercise.

194
00:11:46,450 --> 00:11:47,510
Join me.

195
00:11:46,620 --> 00:11:50,120

Sister.

00:15:16,350 --> 00:15:17,810
I'm not in danger.

256
00:15:18,150 --> 00:15:19,480
Why are you here?

257
00:15:19,950 --> 00:15:21,550
I'm just here to sit with you.

258
00:15:31,630 --> 00:15:32,870
I'll pass.

259
00:15:34,640 --> 00:15:35,680
Alright.

260
00:15:36,430 --> 00:15:37,350
I'll eat it.

261
00:16:12,990 --> 00:16:14,920
Spider, oh spider.

262
00:16:14,950 --> 00:16:17,190
White ape, oh white ape.

263
00:16:17,220 --> 00:16:19,110
Zhao Yuanzhou, oh Zhao Yuanzhou.

264
00:16:21,400 --> 00:16:22,130
Jiu.

265
00:16:22,980 --> 00:16:24,130
Why are you still up?

266
00:16:25,060 --> 00:16:27,190
We're leaving early tomorrow morning.

267
00:16:27,190 --> 00:16:27,910
And you.

268
00:16:27,930 --> 00:16:28,790
Zhao Yuanzhou.

269
00:16:29,840 --> 00:16:31,300
You're not young anymore.

270
00:16:31,350 --> 00:16:33,750
Why are you still fooling around with them?

271
00:16:40,890 --> 00:16:42,610
Since you're here,

272
00:16:42,630 --> 00:16:44,620
why don't we play a game?

273
00:16:45,140 --> 00:16:46,060
Sure.

274
00:16:50,440 --> 00:16:51,700
In Yao's time, there was such a plant.

275
00:16:51,700 --> 00:16:53,430
It grew on the courtyard steps.

276
00:16:53,510 --> 00:16:55,630
When an ill-meaning liar entered the court,

277
00:16:55,630 --> 00:16:57,630
the leaves would bend to identify them.

278
00:16:57,630 --> 00:16:59,760
It's called the Lie-detecting Plant.

279
00:17:00,750 --> 00:17:01,590
This plant

280
00:17:01,590 --> 00:17:02,960
can discern people's hearts

281
00:17:02,960 --> 00:17:04,440
and see through lies.

282
00:17:04,589 --> 00:17:06,680
If it hears a liar,

283
00:17:07,109 --> 00:17:08,710
its leaves will bend

284
00:17:09,310 --> 00:17:10,369
and appear wilted.

285
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:14,690
Whoever my flute points to later

286
00:17:15,329 --> 00:17:17,220
will answer a question from me.

287
00:17:18,589 --> 00:17:20,160
Let's get started.

288
00:17:20,430 --> 00:17:21,230
Okay.

289
00:17:42,670 --> 00:17:43,880
Just ask.

290
00:17:45,750 --> 00:17:46,630
Pei.

291
00:17:47,590 --> 00:17:48,390
Are you

292
00:17:49,050 --> 00:17:50,840
a spy from Chongwu Camp?

293
00:18:02,630 --> 00:18:03,900
What's going on?

294
00:18:05,490 --> 00:18:06,620
What do you mean?

295
00:18:07,490 --> 00:18:10,150
[To Zhuo Yichen]

296
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:09,950
We received a letter from Mr. Situ.

297
00:18:11,150 --> 00:18:12,320
According to the letter,

298
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:14,840
someone tipped Chongwu Camp off.

299
00:18:15,180 --> 00:18:16,320
In other words,

300
00:18:16,430 --> 00:18:17,870
one of us

301
00:18:17,980 --> 00:18:20,060
is a spy from Chongwu Camp.

302
00:18:25,190 --> 00:18:26,110
Chongwu Camp

303
00:18:26,110 --> 00:18:28,750
has been very informed about our movements.

304
00:18:29,630 --> 00:18:32,230
That's why we keep getting blocked in our path.

305
00:18:32,230 --> 00:18:34,430
Only a few people knew that we were going

306
00:18:34,710 --> 00:18:35,510
to Kunlun.

307
00:18:36,790 --> 00:18:38,940
Yet Chongwu Camp knew about it in advance

308
00:18:38,940 --> 00:18:41,470
and made use of Qing Geng to set an ambush here.

309
00:18:43,950 --> 00:18:46,010
With the power of the Shanhai Portal,

310
00:18:46,350 --> 00:18:48,950
we should have directly reached Mount Kunlun.

311
00:18:49,900 --> 00:18:51,650
So who affected Ying Lei

312
00:18:51,680 --> 00:18:53,000
and caused his mistake

313
00:18:53,500 --> 00:18:55,560
which brought us to Sinan Water Town?

314
00:18:58,990 --> 00:19:00,010
I'm sorry.

315
00:19:00,380 --> 00:19:02,350
When I was thinking about Mount Kunlun just now,

316
00:19:02,350 --> 00:19:04,120
I suddenly remembered Ms. Pei mention the

317
00:19:04,120 --> 00:19:06,430
Sinan Water Town at the foot of Mount Kunlun,

318
00:19:06,430 --> 00:19:08,960
which is lively during the Lantern Festival.

319
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:11,980
Who separated us

320
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:13,560
and let Zhuo

321
00:19:13,580 --> 00:19:15,220
investigate first?

322
00:19:15,250 --> 00:19:16,010
Wait.

323
00:19:16,470 --> 00:19:17,350
Wait for what?

324
00:19:17,380 --> 00:19:18,480
For Jiu to be eaten by the demon?

325
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:20,100
Don't you think it's strange?

326
00:19:20,100 --> 00:19:21,500
It's obvious that the demon took Jiu

327
00:19:21,500 --> 00:19:23,220
to lure us over.

328
00:19:24,300 --> 00:19:26,750
Mr. Zhuo and Zhao Yuanzhou have gone into the fog.

329
00:19:26,750 --> 00:19:28,110
They're so capable,

330
00:19:28,110 --> 00:19:29,770
they can definitely save Jiu.

331
00:19:30,540 --> 00:19:32,800
We'll only cause trouble if we join them.

332
00:19:32,830 --> 00:19:34,070
Let's wait here

333
00:19:34,090 --> 00:19:35,290
and see what happens.

334
00:19:42,710 --> 00:19:43,550
Pei.

335
00:19:45,160 --> 00:19:46,120
Are you

336
00:19:46,990 --> 00:19:49,340
a spy from Chongwu Camp?

337
00:19:51,910 --> 00:19:53,110
No.

338
00:20:09,350 --> 00:20:10,270
Ms. Pei.

339
00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:12,330
You lied.

340
00:20:27,740 --> 00:20:29,500
It's so scary, Sister Pei.

341
00:20:29,790 --> 00:20:30,610
You...

342
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:32,340
Stay away from her.

343
00:20:53,270 --> 00:20:54,950
Is this your so-called

344
00:20:55,590 --> 00:20:56,400
evidence?

345
00:21:02,790 --> 00:21:03,960
I knew it.

346
00:21:04,350 --> 00:21:05,590
In this world,

347
00:21:05,790 --> 00:21:08,030
there's nothing that can discern the human heart.

348
00:21:08,030 --> 00:21:09,590
The reason it bent was because

349
00:21:09,590 --> 00:21:11,560
dew gathered on the grass.

350
00:21:11,590 --> 00:21:12,550
Mr. Zhuo

351
00:21:12,550 --> 00:21:15,530
used the water-freezing method I taught him

352
00:21:16,030 --> 00:21:18,030
to control the bending of the grass.

353
00:21:26,530 --> 00:21:28,550
How could you, Mr. Zhuo?

354
00:21:28,900 --> 00:21:30,310
I taught you skills,

355
00:21:30,380 --> 00:21:32,910
but you used them to fool people with Wen Xiao.

356
00:21:40,670 --> 00:21:42,250
You wanted to test me?

357
00:21:44,510 --> 00:21:45,310
Yes.

358
00:21:46,830 --> 00:21:48,490
After all, among the six of us,

359
00:21:48,790 --> 00:21:50,590
you are the most suspicious one.

360
00:22:00,940 --> 00:22:02,290
People from the Chongwu Camp

361
00:22:02,290 --> 00:22:03,790
all have a special

362
00:22:04,020 --> 00:22:06,580
cloud tattoo on their wrists

363
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:08,380
to represent their identity.

364
00:22:09,070 --> 00:22:11,530
I was once the commander of the Chongwu Camp.

365
00:22:11,650 --> 00:22:13,100
It's not a secret.

366
00:22:15,260 --> 00:22:17,400
But I've long left on my own accord.

367
00:22:18,060 --> 00:22:20,860
I have nothing to do with the Chongwu Camp anymore.

368
00:22:21,470 --> 00:22:22,500
Besides,

369
00:22:22,630 --> 00:22:24,670
it was you who convinced me

370
00:22:26,110 --> 00:22:27,170
to join your group.

371
00:22:30,580 --> 00:22:33,300
Besides, I also caught the plague in Lingxi Villa.

372
00:22:33,300 --> 00:22:34,950
I could have died too.

373
00:22:35,130 --> 00:22:37,350
If I were a spy from the Chongwu Camp,

374
00:22:38,630 --> 00:22:40,490
I wouldn't have taken such a risk.

375
00:22:44,630 --> 00:22:46,490
I think what she said makes sense.

376
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:54,490
Since there is a spy among us,

377
00:22:55,110 --> 00:22:56,870
why can't it be you?

378
00:23:00,270 --> 00:23:02,200
Sister Pei, you sure hold a grudge.

379
00:23:04,520 --> 00:23:07,210
I wanted to join the Chongwu Camp.

380
00:23:07,590 --> 00:23:09,670
I heard they know demons very well.

381
00:23:09,690 --> 00:23:11,950
They have a lot of valuable information.

382
00:23:12,270 --> 00:23:14,930
Unfortunately, my father didn't allow me to go.

383
00:23:15,410 --> 00:23:18,010
You're not usually that obedient towards him.

384
00:23:21,110 --> 00:23:22,750
Every Baize Goddess

385
00:23:22,780 --> 00:23:24,080
is good to demons.

386
00:23:24,120 --> 00:23:25,520
It's definitely not her.

387
00:23:28,590 --> 00:23:29,920
She treats demons well.

388
00:23:30,220 --> 00:23:31,750
But she treats great demons

389
00:23:32,260 --> 00:23:33,040
not so well.

390
00:23:44,260 --> 00:23:45,830
Why are you all looking at me?

391
00:23:45,830 --> 00:23:47,460
How could I be a spy?

392
00:23:48,430 --> 00:23:49,470
It's hard to say.

393
00:23:49,550 --> 00:23:50,700
That's right.

394
00:23:51,270 --> 00:23:52,680
If I were a spy,

395
00:23:53,070 --> 00:23:54,350
why would I have come to the Demon Hunting Bureau

396
00:23:54,350 --> 00:23:56,010
to help you complete the task?

397
00:23:56,090 --> 00:23:58,530
I worked so hard and did so much.

398
00:23:58,990 --> 00:24:00,350
A trick to gain our sympathy.

399
00:24:00,350 --> 00:24:01,150
Yes.

400
00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:02,820
You love acting anyway.

401
00:24:04,550 --> 00:24:05,930
I'm a demon.

402
00:24:05,960 --> 00:24:08,310
The Chongwu Camp specializes in killing demons.

403
00:24:08,310 --> 00:24:10,680
Besides, they're eyeing my inner core.

404
00:24:11,020 --> 00:24:12,110
Zhuo Yichen,

405
00:24:12,510 --> 00:24:14,440
please look clearly with your dog-

406
00:24:16,150 --> 00:24:17,620
Look carefully.

407
00:24:18,630 --> 00:24:19,510
But I remember

408
00:24:19,510 --> 00:24:20,970
someone threatened Mr. Situ

409
00:24:20,970 --> 00:24:22,810
in the Demon Hunting Bureau

410
00:24:22,870 --> 00:24:24,650
and said if we didn't collaborate with you,

411
00:24:24,650 --> 00:24:26,450
you would go to the Chongwu Camp.

412
00:24:26,590 --> 00:24:27,750
I was angry.

413
00:24:27,790 --> 00:24:29,330
I said it out of anger.

414
00:24:29,510 --> 00:24:32,570
Do you humans believe words said out of anger that much?

415
00:24:33,470 --> 00:24:35,200
What's there to be angry about?

416
00:24:35,470 --> 00:24:39,130
I was angry because a woman didn't appreciate my true love for her.

417
00:24:42,270 --> 00:24:43,670
There's no greater agony

418
00:24:44,760 --> 00:24:47,160
than giving your heart to the wrong person.

419
00:24:54,430 --> 00:24:55,820
Who's next?

420
00:24:56,540 --> 00:24:57,200
Him.

421
00:25:05,240 --> 00:25:06,040
Huh?

422
00:25:08,790 --> 00:25:10,030
Me?

423
00:25:10,620 --> 00:25:12,410
I'm a cook.

424
00:25:12,440 --> 00:25:14,570
A cook is also suitable for being a spy.

425
00:25:14,840 --> 00:25:16,520
Before I met you,

426
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:18,590
I didn't even know what the Demon Hunting Bureau

427
00:25:18,590 --> 00:25:19,500
or the Chongwu Camp do.

428
00:25:19,500 --> 00:25:20,450
Besides,

429
00:25:20,710 --> 00:25:22,790
you couldn't have gone back

430
00:25:22,810 --> 00:25:23,880
without my Shanhai Portal.

431
00:25:23,880 --> 00:25:25,280
You would have been dead.

432
00:25:25,320 --> 00:25:26,130
You're right.

433
00:25:26,310 --> 00:25:27,110
Yeah.

434
00:25:27,690 --> 00:25:28,430
I guess Little Mountain God

435
00:25:28,430 --> 00:25:31,070
is better at memorizing recipes than intelligence.

436
00:25:31,070 --> 00:25:32,550
He doesn't meet the Chongwu Camp's standards.

437
00:25:32,550 --> 00:25:33,200
Yeah.

438
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:36,380
There's no greater agony

439
00:25:36,670 --> 00:25:39,070
than giving your heart to the wrong person.

440
00:25:41,850 --> 00:25:43,640
Speaking of the mountain god temple,

441
00:25:43,640 --> 00:25:45,630
when we went back to the Demon Hunting Bureau that day,

442
00:25:45,630 --> 00:25:47,180
whose appearance

443
00:25:47,620 --> 00:25:49,680
made us enter the mountain god temple

444
00:25:50,230 --> 00:25:52,960
and almost fall into the trap of the Chongwu Camp?

445
00:25:55,070 --> 00:25:56,430
I'm just a doctor.

446
00:25:56,790 --> 00:25:58,560
And I went there to welcome you.

447
00:25:59,000 --> 00:25:59,800
I'm innocent.

448
00:26:00,030 --> 00:26:01,310
There are also doctors in the Chongwu Camp.

449
00:26:01,310 --> 00:26:02,470
I don't know martial arts.

450
00:26:02,470 --> 00:26:03,990
But you can write prescriptions,

451
00:26:03,990 --> 00:26:05,120
sprinkle medicine,

452
00:26:05,430 --> 00:26:06,880
and do acupuncture.

453
00:26:07,310 --> 00:26:09,040
You're not an ordinary doctor.

454
00:26:10,750 --> 00:26:12,130
I'm timid and afraid of death.

455
00:26:12,130 --> 00:26:12,790
I have hemophobia

456
00:26:12,790 --> 00:26:13,790
and I'm cowardly.

457
00:26:13,950 --> 00:26:16,230
because my mother was seriously ill.

458
00:26:16,230 --> 00:26:17,630
I want to cure my mother.

459
00:26:22,150 --> 00:26:23,480
Your mother's illness?

460
00:26:26,730 --> 00:26:29,130
If your wish is to cure your mother,

461
00:26:30,110 --> 00:26:32,400
the Chongwu Camp has been hunting demons for years.

462
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:34,330
It has collected many rare herbs

463
00:26:34,350 --> 00:26:35,550
and treasures.

464
00:26:36,750 --> 00:26:39,270
Maybe some of them can help you

465
00:26:40,110 --> 00:26:41,310
fulfill your wish.

466
00:26:44,030 --> 00:26:45,310
Say no more.

467
00:26:45,990 --> 00:26:47,200
The Chongwu Camp's members

468
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:49,410
have a cloud tattoo on their wrists.

469
00:26:49,760 --> 00:26:51,760
We'll know after we check his wrist.

470
00:26:55,370 --> 00:26:56,420
Hurry up.

471
00:26:58,350 --> 00:26:59,610
I'm going to air it out.

472
00:27:01,080 --> 00:27:02,480
Just a small patch is wet.

473
00:27:02,550 --> 00:27:03,840
Why bother?

474
00:27:04,990 --> 00:27:06,280
Air it out first.

475
00:27:08,370 --> 00:27:09,170
Come on, Jiu.

476
00:27:20,310 --> 00:27:21,330
Brother Zhuo.

477
00:27:25,350 --> 00:27:26,540
Bai Jiu,

478
00:27:27,310 --> 00:27:29,290
we need to check your wrist.

479
00:27:41,750 --> 00:27:43,780
Actually, Mr. Situ gave us a hint

480
00:27:44,350 --> 00:27:45,580
in the letter.

481
00:27:47,310 --> 00:27:48,900
He said

482
00:27:49,930 --> 00:27:51,850
it's most likely that the spy

483
00:27:52,930 --> 00:27:54,140
is Bai Jiu.

484
00:27:55,660 --> 00:27:56,910
I'm not a spy.

485
00:27:57,440 --> 00:27:58,970
Brother Zhuo, trust me.

486
00:27:59,260 --> 00:28:00,730
I really am not.

487
00:28:05,380 --> 00:28:06,860
Then show us your wrist

488
00:28:07,660 --> 00:28:08,890
and we'll know.

489
00:28:13,670 --> 00:28:14,870
E-Even if there is a cloud tattoo on his wrist,

490
00:28:14,870 --> 00:28:16,550
it... it doesn't mean he is

491
00:28:16,620 --> 00:28:17,720
a spy from the Chongwu Camp.

492
00:28:17,720 --> 00:28:18,660
Is there any other possibility?

493
00:28:18,660 --> 00:28:19,750
So,

494
00:28:21,300 --> 00:28:23,300
you saw it on Bai Jiu's wrist?

495
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:26,020
No.

496
00:28:27,350 --> 00:28:29,110
I was just asking.

497
00:28:29,990 --> 00:28:30,790
Ying Lei,

498
00:28:31,790 --> 00:28:33,230
you're so bad at lying.

499
00:28:33,230 --> 00:28:33,910
Well,

500
00:28:34,060 --> 00:28:35,680
how could Jiu be a spy?

501
00:28:35,910 --> 00:28:36,770
Think about it.

502
00:28:36,810 --> 00:28:38,410
He has been treating us.

503
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:39,610
Without him,

504
00:28:39,670 --> 00:28:41,000
we would have been dead!

505
00:28:41,060 --> 00:28:42,120
-Ying Lei!
-And...

506
00:28:42,940 --> 00:28:43,920
Stop talking.

507
00:28:44,280 --> 00:28:46,280
Your trust in me alone is pointless.

508
00:28:49,570 --> 00:28:50,970
I either have the tattoo,

509
00:28:51,940 --> 00:28:53,130
or I don't.

510
00:28:56,210 --> 00:28:58,060
So is there a cloud tattoo or not?

511
00:29:47,550 --> 00:29:48,430
Brother Zhuo.

512
00:29:52,840 --> 00:29:54,420
Do you believe me now?

513
00:30:02,580 --> 00:30:03,380
Bai Jiu!

514
00:30:29,270 --> 00:30:34,510
♫Has anyone seen a bird with a broken tail?♫

515
00:30:33,070 --> 00:30:33,910
Jiu,

516
00:30:34,560 --> 00:30:35,720
have you gone to bed?

517
00:30:34,700 --> 00:30:39,840
♫The rain wet its feathers♫

518
00:30:41,550 --> 00:30:46,810
♫There're no worries in its eyes♫

519
00:30:46,980 --> 00:30:52,230
♫It just wants to sleep on a roof♫

520
00:30:48,550 --> 00:30:49,350
Little Bunny,

521
00:30:50,430 --> 00:30:51,690
we were too arbitrary.

522
00:30:51,880 --> 00:30:53,010
We apologize to you.

523
00:30:53,150 --> 00:30:56,130
♫The bell jingles and sways♫

524
00:30:56,240 --> 00:30:59,060
♫Thoughts circle back and forth♫

525
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:04,790
♫Who can truly understand the essence of growing up?♫

526
00:31:02,830 --> 00:31:03,640
Jiu,

527
00:31:04,300 --> 00:31:06,350
I'll give you all the meat next time.

528
00:31:05,460 --> 00:31:08,700
♫Life is grand♫

529
00:31:07,030 --> 00:31:07,890
Don't be angry.

530
00:31:09,370 --> 00:31:11,690
♫Yet so small♫

531
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:16,930
♫I hope everything is fine♫

532
00:31:45,330 --> 00:31:51,100
♫Has anyone seen a bird with a broken tail?♫

533
00:31:51,350 --> 00:31:56,550
♫The rain wet its feathers♫

534
00:31:59,080 --> 00:32:05,000
♫Its cry has never been heard♫

535
00:32:05,320 --> 00:32:11,640
♫Only I know its story♫

536
00:32:25,800 --> 00:32:28,570
The matter about the Chongwu Camp's spy still needs to be verified.

537
00:32:28,570 --> 00:32:30,150
Why did you tell them?

538
00:32:32,320 --> 00:32:34,450
You know my relationship with Bai Jiu.

539
00:32:34,750 --> 00:32:37,210
I really don't want him to go to Mount Kunlun.

540
00:32:37,630 --> 00:32:39,070
If I stop him from going there,

541
00:32:39,070 --> 00:32:40,670
he will definitely disobey.

542
00:32:40,680 --> 00:32:42,530
That's why I did that.

543
00:32:44,110 --> 00:32:45,270
You really...

544
00:32:45,290 --> 00:32:46,050
My Lord,

545
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:47,060
our scout found

546
00:32:47,130 --> 00:32:48,840
Commander Zhen has secretly led

547
00:32:48,840 --> 00:32:50,550
a secret elite troop of the Chongwu Camp

548
00:32:50,550 --> 00:32:52,430
to Mount Kunlun.

549
00:33:34,280 --> 00:33:35,080
Jiu.

550
00:33:44,830 --> 00:33:45,780
Did you sleep well,

551
00:33:45,780 --> 00:33:46,820
Little Bunny?

552
00:33:46,980 --> 00:33:47,610
Jiu.

553
00:33:49,830 --> 00:33:52,290
The shopkeeper even gave us a chicken?

554
00:33:55,910 --> 00:33:57,220
I stole it.

555
00:33:57,560 --> 00:33:59,410
Jiu, come and eat.

556
00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:01,170
We should set out after eating.

557
00:34:28,030 --> 00:34:30,100
Looks like the one Little Bunny cares most about

558
00:34:30,100 --> 00:34:32,989
is the great hero in his heart: Mr. Zhuo.

559
00:34:33,150 --> 00:34:34,370
You pissed him off.

560
00:34:34,400 --> 00:34:36,340
Are you sure you're not going to coax him?

561
00:34:36,340 --> 00:34:38,239
We all pissed him off, right?

562
00:34:38,429 --> 00:34:40,040
How come it's my fault?

563
00:34:41,880 --> 00:34:44,520
But he obviously hates you the most now.

564
00:34:46,110 --> 00:34:47,320
Zhao Yuanzhou,

565
00:34:47,670 --> 00:34:49,350
are you very happy now

566
00:34:49,389 --> 00:34:52,320
because finally, someone is more annoying than you?

567
00:34:53,860 --> 00:34:55,880
He's good at fighting and hunting demons.

568
00:34:55,880 --> 00:34:57,590
But coaxing kids

569
00:34:57,750 --> 00:34:59,710
is too difficult for Mr. Zhuo.

570
00:35:00,830 --> 00:35:01,940
It's very easy

571
00:35:02,010 --> 00:35:03,260
to coax kids.

572
00:35:05,140 --> 00:35:06,400
It's very easy.

573
00:35:06,590 --> 00:35:07,670
Give him a candy

574
00:35:07,830 --> 00:35:09,280
and pat him on his head.

575
00:35:18,700 --> 00:35:19,910
Candy?

576
00:35:56,620 --> 00:35:58,920
Dear friends and relatives,

577
00:35:59,240 --> 00:36:01,180
please open your eyes.

578
00:36:01,250 --> 00:36:02,130
What's ahead is

579
00:36:02,710 --> 00:36:04,790
the Kunlun mountain god temple.

580
00:36:12,840 --> 00:36:13,640
Let's go.

581
00:36:21,560 --> 00:36:22,780
♫In this bustling world♫

582
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:24,220
♫Scattered traces remain♫

583
00:36:24,480 --> 00:36:27,180
♫The riddle of time♫

584
00:36:27,550 --> 00:36:28,940
♫The joy and sorrow of life♫

585
00:36:29,050 --> 00:36:30,260
♫A few hasty lines♫

586
00:36:30,550 --> 00:36:33,060
♫Addressing love and hate♫

587
00:36:33,580 --> 00:36:34,730
♫I wish to become the wind♫

588
00:36:35,100 --> 00:36:36,210
♫And transform into rain♫

589
00:36:36,560 --> 00:36:39,260
♫To accompany you for thousands of miles♫

590
00:36:39,470 --> 00:36:40,640
♫From the south to the north♫

591
00:36:41,020 --> 00:36:42,080
♫From the east to the west♫

592
00:36:42,670 --> 00:36:44,860
♫Fireworks adorn the scene♫

593
00:36:44,940 --> 00:36:48,290
♫You say there are countless rules in this world♫

594
00:36:48,370 --> 00:36:50,690
♫But none can compare to "I am willing"♫

595
00:36:50,810 --> 00:36:56,280
♫I say if fate is determined by Heaven, I'll defy Heaven♫

596
00:36:53,250 --> 00:36:53,890
Grandpa!

597
00:36:53,970 --> 00:36:54,770
I'm back!

598
00:36:56,840 --> 00:37:00,160
♫Wealth and fame turn to dust and drift away♫

599
00:37:00,460 --> 00:37:02,500
♫Love and hate are best left unspoken♫

600
00:37:01,120 --> 00:37:01,750
Grandpa.

601
00:37:02,010 --> 00:37:03,010
Let go.

602
00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:08,420
♫Better to have a dream before parting ways♫

603
00:37:03,550 --> 00:37:05,710
Stop shaking me.

604
00:37:07,230 --> 00:37:08,860
Ying Lei, you're back.

605
00:37:09,270 --> 00:37:10,110
What?

606
00:37:10,560 --> 00:37:13,540
Don't you want to pursue your great dream in the mortal world?

607
00:37:13,540 --> 00:37:15,150
I still want to pursue it.

608
00:37:15,830 --> 00:37:16,470
But we

609
00:37:16,490 --> 00:37:17,830
have found the Baize Token.

610
00:37:17,830 --> 00:37:18,670
The priority

611
00:37:18,710 --> 00:37:19,700
is to come back

612
00:37:19,720 --> 00:37:21,130
to save the Wilderness.

613
00:37:24,910 --> 00:37:25,640
Goddess,

614
00:37:27,040 --> 00:37:28,690
this is my grandpa, Ying Zhao.

615
00:37:28,690 --> 00:37:30,490
That man is Mountain God Zhu Yin.

616
00:37:31,490 --> 00:37:33,260
Goddess, greetings.

617
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:38,570
Ms. Wen Xiao, thank you for bringing back the Baize Divine Power.

618
00:37:38,570 --> 00:37:40,000
Mountain Gods in the Wilderness

619
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:41,330
will be at your command.

620
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:44,790
Mr. Zhu Yin,

621
00:37:45,240 --> 00:37:47,160
I just retrieved the Baize Token.

622
00:37:47,770 --> 00:37:49,130
I don't know

623
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:51,600
if I can save the Wilderness.

624
00:37:51,830 --> 00:37:53,550
I still need your guidance.

625
00:37:54,580 --> 00:37:55,830
You brat!

626
00:37:57,800 --> 00:37:59,590
You actually came back.

627
00:38:00,240 --> 00:38:01,570
Brat!

628
00:38:03,750 --> 00:38:04,630
Take this.

629
00:38:04,870 --> 00:38:07,020
I'll hit back if you hit me again.

630
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:08,840
Hit back!

631
00:38:08,990 --> 00:38:09,710
Hit back!

632
00:38:09,900 --> 00:38:10,830
I told you to stop!

633
00:38:10,830 --> 00:38:11,830
Take this. You...

634
00:38:12,990 --> 00:38:13,350
Freeze!

635
00:38:13,350 --> 00:38:15,440
-Cut it out!
-Stop!

636
00:38:15,440 --> 00:38:16,590
Stop!

637
00:38:17,750 --> 00:38:19,450
A master is beating his dog.

638
00:38:19,690 --> 00:38:20,780
He's taming a monkey.

639
00:38:20,780 --> 00:38:22,440
I helped you clear up the mess.

640
00:38:22,570 --> 00:38:24,640
Have you forgotten the rules

641
00:38:24,740 --> 00:38:26,760
and moral characters I told you?

642
00:38:28,050 --> 00:38:28,760
Grandpa Ying Zhao.

643
00:38:28,760 --> 00:38:29,560
Take this!

644
00:38:35,620 --> 00:38:37,650
You are the legendary Torch Dragon?

645
00:38:37,810 --> 00:38:39,300
Goddess, you know me?

646
00:38:40,040 --> 00:38:41,020
Legend has it that

647
00:38:41,020 --> 00:38:43,220
you're the most mysterious Dragon God.

648
00:38:43,450 --> 00:38:46,580
You can illuminate the darkest part of the netherworld.

649
00:39:10,130 --> 00:39:11,690
Zhu Yin and I

650
00:39:11,720 --> 00:39:13,740
have guarded the gate for years.

651
00:39:16,680 --> 00:39:17,960
Now,

652
00:39:17,990 --> 00:39:20,190
Mount Kunlun is about to collapse.

653
00:39:20,430 --> 00:39:21,430
The Wilderness

654
00:39:21,570 --> 00:39:22,920
is at stake.

655
00:39:26,990 --> 00:39:28,720
The 28 constellations

656
00:39:28,950 --> 00:39:30,800
have vanished.

657
00:39:31,310 --> 00:39:33,660
There is nothing we can do.

658
00:39:34,810 --> 00:39:36,630
But now that Goddess is back,

659
00:39:36,950 --> 00:39:39,030
we just need to activate the Star Formation

660
00:39:39,030 --> 00:39:40,390
and inject the Baize Divine Power.

661
00:39:40,390 --> 00:39:42,190
Then we can save the Wilderness.

662
00:39:42,390 --> 00:39:44,250
There's something very strange.

663
00:39:45,230 --> 00:39:46,290
Grandpa Ying Zhao,

664
00:39:46,630 --> 00:39:47,830
you've lived for many years.

665
00:39:47,830 --> 00:39:49,600
Help me analyze it.

666
00:39:50,990 --> 00:39:52,420
You are

667
00:39:52,500 --> 00:39:54,110
still so annoying.

668
00:39:54,120 --> 00:39:55,570
You live up to your name.

669
00:39:55,910 --> 00:39:57,110
Just ask.

670
00:39:58,400 --> 00:40:00,470
The Baize Token has been missing for so long.

671
00:40:00,470 --> 00:40:02,670
I didn't expect it to be divided into two

672
00:40:03,020 --> 00:40:05,500
and left in Wen Xiao and me.

673
00:40:06,140 --> 00:40:07,400
But why couldn't I feel

674
00:40:07,880 --> 00:40:10,450
the Baize Token at all before?

675
00:40:10,990 --> 00:40:12,870
Since the Original Goddess,

676
00:40:13,800 --> 00:40:15,370
for the sake of fairness,

677
00:40:15,840 --> 00:40:18,260
the Baize Token has been divided into two,

678
00:40:18,510 --> 00:40:21,270
kept by a person and a demon.

679
00:40:21,880 --> 00:40:23,360
Only when the two keepers

680
00:40:23,650 --> 00:40:25,070
share a telepathic connection

681
00:40:25,070 --> 00:40:26,800
and fall in love with each other

682
00:40:26,920 --> 00:40:29,570
can they activate and use the power.

683
00:40:39,980 --> 00:40:41,670
This is too sudden.

684
00:40:47,070 --> 00:40:47,910
Since

685
00:40:47,940 --> 00:40:49,940
Goddess has regained her power,

686
00:40:49,960 --> 00:40:51,800
I guess you two already

687
00:40:51,950 --> 00:40:52,990
trust each other

688
00:40:53,690 --> 00:40:55,690
and share a telepathic connection.

689
00:40:59,190 --> 00:41:01,320
Zhao Yuanzhou, you're so despicable.

690
00:41:01,330 --> 00:41:03,150
Brother Zhuo and Wen

691
00:41:03,170 --> 00:41:04,510
are childhood sweethearts.

692
00:41:04,510 --> 00:41:05,510
How could you

693
00:41:05,510 --> 00:41:06,310
do this?

694
00:41:06,350 --> 00:41:08,050
So what if they've fallen in love with each other?

695
00:41:08,050 --> 00:41:09,670
Brotherhood is also love.

696
00:41:09,700 --> 00:41:11,220
Friendship is also love.

697
00:41:11,480 --> 00:41:13,680
We went through hardships along the way

698
00:41:13,710 --> 00:41:14,750
and shared weal and woe.

699
00:41:14,750 --> 00:41:16,150
We can say we share a telepathic connection.

700
00:41:16,150 --> 00:41:17,180
No need to mind it.

701
00:41:17,850 --> 00:41:18,570
-Yes.
-Yes.

702
00:41:18,930 --> 00:41:20,480
Mr. Zhuo, you are

703
00:41:20,640 --> 00:41:21,650
prudent.

704
00:41:22,660 --> 00:41:24,060
Stop talking about this.

705
00:41:24,390 --> 00:41:25,920
Let's hurry up

706
00:41:25,940 --> 00:41:27,510
and activate the formation.

707
00:41:27,510 --> 00:41:29,230
But the spiritual energy of Mount Kunlun

708
00:41:29,230 --> 00:41:30,790
has weakened long ago.

709
00:41:31,670 --> 00:41:34,620
The Star Formation requires a lot of spiritual energy.

710
00:41:34,620 --> 00:41:36,070
We'd better activate it

711
00:41:36,670 --> 00:41:38,630
at noon, when the spiritual energy

712
00:41:38,630 --> 00:41:39,630
is the strongest.

713
00:41:42,410 --> 00:41:43,970
Let's wait till tomorrow.

714
00:41:49,870 --> 00:41:51,950
Stall them in Sinan Water Town.

715
00:41:52,430 --> 00:41:53,780
Can you do it?

716
00:41:53,810 --> 00:41:55,410
How long should I stall them?

717
00:41:55,750 --> 00:41:56,630
It has to be

718
00:41:57,040 --> 00:41:58,120
just the right time.
