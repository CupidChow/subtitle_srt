1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,400
Gdes Shirley

2
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:28,060
dissolves你在这里

3
00:00:58,060 --> 00:01:03,060
I'm sorry, but I'm not sure if I can get the money back.

4
00:01:03,060 --> 00:01:08,060
I'm sorry, but I'm not sure if I can get the money back.

5
00:01:08,060 --> 00:01:13,060
I'm sorry, but I'm not sure if I can get the money back.

6
00:01:13,060 --> 00:01:18,060
I'm sorry, but I'm not sure if I can get the money back.

7
00:01:18,060 --> 00:01:23,060
I'm sorry, but I'm not sure if I can get the money back.

8
00:01:23,060 --> 00:01:28,060
I'm sorry, but I'm not sure if I can get the money back.

9
00:01:28,060 --> 00:01:33,060
I'm sorry, but I'm not sure if I can get the money back.

10
00:01:33,060 --> 00:01:38,060
I'm sorry, but I'm not sure if I can get the money back.

11
00:01:54,060 --> 00:01:58,060
A day later

12
00:02:11,060 --> 00:02:13,060
Sister Pei.

13
00:02:14,060 --> 00:02:17,060
Zhang Yuan Shou said

14
00:02:17,060 --> 00:02:21,060
I'll give you this medal.

15
00:02:23,060 --> 00:02:25,060
I don't know what he wants to do.

16
00:02:33,060 --> 00:02:34,060
Sister Pei.

17
00:02:36,060 --> 00:02:38,060
You must want to be alone.

18
00:02:40,060 --> 00:02:42,060
Then I'll go first.

19
00:02:53,060 --> 00:02:55,060
I'll go first.

20
00:03:10,060 --> 00:03:11,060
Sister.

21
00:03:23,060 --> 00:03:27,060
I'm always by your side.

22
00:03:27,060 --> 00:03:31,060
I'll protect you from the wind.

23
00:03:31,060 --> 00:03:33,060
You're a good person.

24
00:03:38,060 --> 00:03:39,060
Of course not.

25
00:03:40,060 --> 00:03:42,060
And I'm dead long ago.

26
00:03:43,060 --> 00:03:45,060
Sister knows it.

27
00:03:54,060 --> 00:03:57,060
Then how can I?

28
00:03:59,060 --> 00:04:01,060
The magic of the super-wide-angle Soul-dense-dense.

29
00:04:01,060 --> 00:04:03,060
It keeps my consciousness.

30
00:04:04,060 --> 00:04:07,060
I have a magic called Soul-dense-dense.

31
00:04:08,060 --> 00:04:10,060
It can make your body

32
00:04:10,060 --> 00:04:12,060
to be re-dressed on the ink.

33
00:04:13,060 --> 00:04:15,060
But the soul-dense-dense.

34
00:04:15,060 --> 00:04:17,060
It's useless.

35
00:04:18,060 --> 00:04:20,060
It's useless to beg for life.

36
00:04:21,060 --> 00:04:23,060
You can't recognize it.

37
00:04:24,060 --> 00:04:25,060
Maybe you can

38
00:04:26,060 --> 00:04:29,060
accompany your sister every day.

39
00:04:31,060 --> 00:04:32,060
Are you willing to do it?

40
00:04:45,060 --> 00:04:47,060
I can accompany my sister

41
00:04:47,060 --> 00:04:49,060
occasionally.

42
00:04:50,060 --> 00:04:52,060
I can accompany my sister.

43
00:04:58,060 --> 00:04:59,060
Hong.

44
00:05:04,060 --> 00:05:06,060
Why are you so stupid?

45
00:05:08,060 --> 00:05:09,060
I've been sick.

46
00:05:11,060 --> 00:05:13,060
I've always been at home.

47
00:05:15,060 --> 00:05:18,060
I've never felt that you are my burden.

48
00:05:21,060 --> 00:05:23,060
I want to be a hunter.

49
00:05:25,060 --> 00:05:26,060
It's for myself.

50
00:05:28,060 --> 00:05:30,060
Not for you.

51
00:05:31,060 --> 00:05:33,060
You've been weak since you were young.

52
00:05:35,060 --> 00:05:37,060
It's boring to be in the human world.

53
00:05:37,060 --> 00:05:38,060
But in the world of the underworld,

54
00:05:38,060 --> 00:05:40,060
there may be miracles.

55
00:05:42,060 --> 00:05:44,060
So I'm trying to hunt.

56
00:05:45,060 --> 00:05:47,060
Just to be able to find the soul-dense-dense

57
00:05:47,060 --> 00:05:49,060
and cure you.

58
00:05:53,060 --> 00:05:55,060
I don't feel tired.

59
00:06:00,060 --> 00:06:02,060
Because this is my biggest wish.

60
00:06:04,060 --> 00:06:05,060
Sister.

61
00:06:06,060 --> 00:06:08,060
Your heart has been fulfilled.

62
00:06:10,060 --> 00:06:11,060
I'm healthy now.

63
00:06:12,060 --> 00:06:13,060
You are strong.

64
00:06:14,060 --> 00:06:16,060
I'm not afraid of anything.

65
00:06:17,060 --> 00:06:19,060
I won't let you worry about it anymore.

66
00:06:23,060 --> 00:06:25,060
I can still protect you.

67
00:06:32,060 --> 00:06:33,060
Sister.

68
00:06:38,060 --> 00:06:39,060
I...

69
00:06:40,060 --> 00:06:42,060
I didn't want to become a monster.

70
00:06:44,060 --> 00:06:45,060
I'm scared.

71
00:06:47,060 --> 00:06:49,060
Because I became a monster.

72
00:06:53,060 --> 00:06:55,060
I can't be your brother anymore.

73
00:07:05,060 --> 00:07:06,060
Don't be afraid.

74
00:07:08,060 --> 00:07:10,060
If you become a monster again,

75
00:07:11,060 --> 00:07:13,060
I'll be with you.

76
00:07:17,060 --> 00:07:19,060
I finally learned to joke.

77
00:07:21,060 --> 00:07:22,060
Think about it.

78
00:07:25,060 --> 00:07:26,060
It's a good thing.

79
00:07:33,060 --> 00:07:34,060
So, sister.

80
00:07:35,060 --> 00:07:36,060
Look.

81
00:07:37,060 --> 00:07:38,060
No matter what,

82
00:07:41,060 --> 00:07:43,060
this is a good ending.

83
00:07:43,060 --> 00:07:44,060
It's a good ending.

84
00:07:46,060 --> 00:07:47,060
Isn't it?

85
00:07:50,060 --> 00:07:51,060
Sister.

86
00:07:52,060 --> 00:07:53,060
Remember.

87
00:07:55,060 --> 00:07:56,060
Think about it.

88
00:07:58,060 --> 00:07:59,060
Don't cry anymore

89
00:08:03,060 --> 00:08:04,060
in the future.

90
00:08:13,060 --> 00:08:14,060
Sister.

91
00:08:22,060 --> 00:08:23,060
Sister.

92
00:08:43,060 --> 00:08:44,060
Sister.

93
00:09:14,060 --> 00:09:15,060
Can't you sleep?

94
00:09:29,060 --> 00:09:31,060
Tomorrow, you will be sleepy.

95
00:09:34,060 --> 00:09:35,060
Good.

96
00:09:36,060 --> 00:09:37,060
What about you?

97
00:09:38,060 --> 00:09:39,060
Are you going with us?

98
00:09:41,060 --> 00:09:42,060
Me?

99
00:09:44,060 --> 00:09:45,060
I'm going to the temple.

100
00:09:46,060 --> 00:09:48,060
The temple is still waiting for the meal.

101
00:09:49,060 --> 00:09:50,060
Everyone likes me.

102
00:09:55,060 --> 00:09:57,060
You can stay in the world as a cook.

103
00:09:58,060 --> 00:10:00,060
Don't you want to go back to the world?

104
00:10:02,060 --> 00:10:03,060
No.

105
00:10:05,060 --> 00:10:06,060
I don't know.

106
00:10:07,060 --> 00:10:08,060
The world is so good.

107
00:10:10,060 --> 00:10:11,060
There is nothing in the world.

108
00:10:13,060 --> 00:10:16,060
But my grandfather and they have always been willing to stay in the world.

109
00:10:17,060 --> 00:10:18,060
The mother is lonely.

110
00:10:20,060 --> 00:10:21,060
The father is alive.

111
00:10:23,060 --> 00:10:24,060
If I live like this,

112
00:10:26,060 --> 00:10:27,060
I think it's boring.

113
00:10:28,060 --> 00:10:30,060
There are many ways to live like this.

114
00:10:32,060 --> 00:10:33,060
It's your choice.

115
00:10:35,060 --> 00:10:36,060
It's not the moon.

116
00:10:38,060 --> 00:10:39,060
It's not the moon.

117
00:10:40,060 --> 00:10:41,060
It's not the moon.

118
00:10:41,060 --> 00:10:42,060
There is no wrong in my dream.

119
00:10:43,060 --> 00:10:46,060
Some people are willing to be a quiet tiger.

120
00:10:48,060 --> 00:10:49,060
Some people

121
00:10:50,060 --> 00:10:52,060
want to be the river in which the capital owed you.

122
00:10:54,060 --> 00:10:56,060
What about the god-woman?

123
00:10:58,060 --> 00:10:59,060
How do you choose?

124
00:11:02,060 --> 00:11:03,060
Master said

125
00:11:04,060 --> 00:11:07,060
we are not the god-woman's choice.

126
00:11:08,060 --> 00:11:10,060
We want to protect the heart of the dead.

127
00:11:12,060 --> 00:11:13,060
I hope the two worlds are peaceful.

128
00:11:15,060 --> 00:11:16,060
Because the world and the world

129
00:11:18,060 --> 00:11:19,060
have people I care about.

130
00:11:23,060 --> 00:11:24,060
He Yao.

131
00:11:28,060 --> 00:11:29,060
Come with us to Kunlun.

132
00:11:31,060 --> 00:11:34,060
Xiao Jiu is waiting for you to cook him a delicious meal.

133
00:11:42,060 --> 00:11:45,060
The plan is more important than imagination.

134
00:11:46,060 --> 00:11:47,060
Have a drink.

135
00:11:54,060 --> 00:11:55,060
Look at my eyes.

136
00:11:56,060 --> 00:11:58,060
It makes me uncomfortable.

137
00:12:11,060 --> 00:12:12,060
The plan is going well.

138
00:12:14,060 --> 00:12:16,060
You have to be careful.

139
00:12:17,060 --> 00:12:19,060
Look at who I am.

140
00:12:21,060 --> 00:12:22,060
Don't be smart.

141
00:12:23,060 --> 00:12:24,060
Don't worry.

142
00:12:25,060 --> 00:12:27,060
Our goal is the same.

143
00:12:28,060 --> 00:12:30,060
I believe we will get the white-collar order.

144
00:12:31,060 --> 00:12:32,060
I will do my best.

145
00:12:33,060 --> 00:12:34,060
I will do my best.

146
00:12:35,060 --> 00:12:36,060
I will do my best.

147
00:12:37,060 --> 00:12:38,060
I will do my best.

148
00:12:38,060 --> 00:12:40,060
I believe we will get the white-collar order.

149
00:12:41,060 --> 00:12:43,060
Don't you feel happy?

150
00:12:45,060 --> 00:12:48,060
It's not worth it.

151
00:12:51,060 --> 00:12:53,060
The time has come.

152
00:12:55,060 --> 00:12:56,060
The time has come.

153
00:13:00,060 --> 00:13:01,060
The time has come.

154
00:13:02,060 --> 00:13:04,060
The time has come.

155
00:13:04,060 --> 00:13:05,060
The time has come.

156
00:13:06,060 --> 00:13:08,060
It's time to get the white-collar order.

157
00:13:11,060 --> 00:13:12,060
So we can't let the people of Ji Yao Temple

158
00:13:13,060 --> 00:13:14,060
get to Kunlun too soon.

159
00:13:16,060 --> 00:13:17,060
You have to find a way.

160
00:13:18,060 --> 00:13:19,060
Don't worry.

161
00:13:22,060 --> 00:13:24,060
Qin Gang has been waiting for you in Kunlun Mountain.

162
00:13:28,060 --> 00:13:29,060
But you have to make a decision.

163
00:13:30,060 --> 00:13:31,060
You have to promise me something.

164
00:13:32,060 --> 00:13:34,060
I will give you the order

165
00:13:35,060 --> 00:13:36,060
of Zhao Yanzhou.

166
00:13:39,060 --> 00:13:41,060
You have to promise me something.

167
00:13:45,060 --> 00:13:46,060
Can you do it?

168
00:13:50,060 --> 00:13:51,060
No need to do it.

169
00:13:52,060 --> 00:13:54,060
Someone will do it for me.

170
00:13:55,060 --> 00:13:57,060
And it's more suitable than me.

171
00:14:02,060 --> 00:14:03,060
I will do it.

172
00:14:04,060 --> 00:14:05,060
I will do it.

173
00:14:06,060 --> 00:14:08,060
You are the one who should be punished.

174
00:14:09,060 --> 00:14:10,060
You are the one who should be punished.

175
00:14:11,060 --> 00:14:12,060
I will do it.

176
00:14:18,060 --> 00:14:19,060
I will do it.

177
00:14:21,060 --> 00:14:22,060
I will do it.

178
00:14:23,060 --> 00:14:24,060
You have to promise me something.

179
00:14:25,060 --> 00:14:26,060
I will do it.

180
00:14:27,060 --> 00:14:28,060
I will do it.

181
00:14:28,060 --> 00:14:30,060
I know.

182
00:14:31,060 --> 00:14:33,060
I'll do my best.

183
00:14:47,060 --> 00:14:49,060
As for one year,

184
00:14:49,060 --> 00:14:52,060
it's a year of suffering.

185
00:14:53,060 --> 00:14:55,060
Life turns around,

186
00:14:55,060 --> 00:14:57,060
but a moment of obsession

187
00:14:57,060 --> 00:14:59,060
is a cause.

188
00:15:07,060 --> 00:15:10,060
Wan Xiang, what are you writing?

189
00:15:10,060 --> 00:15:12,060
The obsession of the Emperor

190
00:15:12,060 --> 00:15:14,060
is to let the Goddess live.

191
00:15:15,060 --> 00:15:17,060
One year is too long,

192
00:15:17,060 --> 00:15:19,060
and the fire is too strong.

193
00:15:19,060 --> 00:15:21,060
It will eventually hurt itself.

194
00:15:22,060 --> 00:15:24,060
I'm only a useless person

195
00:15:25,060 --> 00:15:27,060
to you.

196
00:15:28,060 --> 00:15:30,060
I'm also a Goddess.

197
00:15:33,060 --> 00:15:34,060
I'm so happy.

198
00:15:34,060 --> 00:15:36,060
I'm going to the village.

199
00:15:36,060 --> 00:15:37,060
I'll tell you,

200
00:15:37,060 --> 00:15:38,060
I've been dressed in a lot of clothes.

201
00:15:38,060 --> 00:15:39,060
It's so heavy.

202
00:15:43,060 --> 00:15:44,060
Xiao Shuang,

203
00:15:44,060 --> 00:15:46,060
my box is so heavy.

204
00:15:46,060 --> 00:15:47,060
Give it to me.

205
00:15:47,060 --> 00:15:48,060
I'll carry it for you.

206
00:15:49,060 --> 00:15:50,060
I've lost it all.

207
00:15:52,060 --> 00:15:54,060
Thank you, Xiao Shuang.

208
00:15:54,060 --> 00:15:56,060
I'm not going to use my strength.

209
00:16:00,060 --> 00:16:02,060
There's a bigger one over there.

210
00:16:05,060 --> 00:16:06,060
Let's go.

211
00:16:07,060 --> 00:16:08,060
Friends.

212
00:16:10,060 --> 00:16:12,060
People are all riding the eagle.

213
00:16:12,060 --> 00:16:14,060
It's so hard to find a way to use it.

214
00:16:14,060 --> 00:16:16,060
Kunlun Mountain.

215
00:16:16,060 --> 00:16:17,060
No problem.

216
00:16:17,060 --> 00:16:18,060
My place.

217
00:16:22,060 --> 00:16:24,060
Kunlun Mountain.

218
00:16:30,060 --> 00:16:31,060
This...

219
00:16:32,060 --> 00:16:34,060
This is Kunlun Mountain.

220
00:16:39,060 --> 00:16:40,060
Well...

221
00:16:40,060 --> 00:16:41,060
I'm sorry.

222
00:16:41,060 --> 00:16:43,060
When I was thinking about Kunlun Mountain,

223
00:16:43,060 --> 00:16:45,060
I suddenly thought of a person who said

224
00:16:45,060 --> 00:16:47,060
Kunlun Mountain is a private water fountain.

225
00:16:47,060 --> 00:16:49,060
I forgot.

226
00:16:49,060 --> 00:16:51,060
I thought of it all at once.

227
00:16:52,060 --> 00:16:55,060
The water fountain in Sinan is located under Kunlun Mountain.

228
00:16:55,060 --> 00:16:57,060
I came here when I was in the case.

229
00:16:57,060 --> 00:16:59,060
I ran into a flower pot.

230
00:16:59,060 --> 00:17:01,060
I suddenly remembered it.

231
00:17:01,060 --> 00:17:03,060
What did you hear?

232
00:17:04,060 --> 00:17:05,060
It's okay.

233
00:17:06,060 --> 00:17:07,060
It's not far from here.

234
00:17:07,060 --> 00:17:08,060
I'm afraid that the mountain will be here.

235
00:17:08,060 --> 00:17:09,060
The mountain?

236
00:17:09,060 --> 00:17:11,060
The mountain is quite good.

237
00:17:15,060 --> 00:17:17,060
The water fountain in Sinan is a place where people live.

238
00:17:17,060 --> 00:17:19,060
People live in peace.

239
00:17:19,060 --> 00:17:22,060
It's a rich and well-off garden.

240
00:17:23,060 --> 00:17:27,060
But it doesn't look like it.

241
00:17:27,060 --> 00:17:29,060
It looks like

242
00:17:30,060 --> 00:17:32,060
many people are dead.

243
00:17:44,060 --> 00:17:46,060
They are already in Sinan.

244
00:17:47,060 --> 00:17:48,860
Kunlun Mountain is

245
00:17:49,060 --> 00:17:51,100
almost completely suddenly suddenly

246
00:17:51,100 --> 00:17:54,020
we are here.

247
00:17:54,020 --> 00:17:55,000
Kunlun Mountain is just broadband.

248
00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:04,420
How do you

249
00:18:06,260 --> 00:18:08,060
find people?

250
00:18:08,060 --> 00:18:10,060
Maybe Shebao is one of the gate changers.

251
00:18:11,060 --> 00:18:13,060
Maybe he's new.

252
00:18:13,060 --> 00:18:15,060
It's in the helicopter.

253
00:18:15,060 --> 00:18:16,100
Is the莊137

254
00:18:16,100 --> 00:18:17,260
Yes.

255
00:18:29,500 --> 00:18:31,340
When we came to the Prague case,

256
00:18:31,340 --> 00:18:33,500
the views weren't different at all.

257
00:18:33,540 --> 00:18:37,220
What exactly happened during the short hot months?

258
00:18:40,140 --> 00:18:41,660
I am so scared!

259
00:18:41,700 --> 00:18:43,700
I can't stand the bittersweetness.

260
00:18:43,700 --> 00:18:45,700
Are you scared?

261
00:18:45,700 --> 00:18:47,700
You're my little god.

262
00:18:51,700 --> 00:18:53,700
Xiaojiao, you're holding me like this.

263
00:18:53,700 --> 00:18:55,700
I'm still so timid.

264
00:18:55,700 --> 00:18:57,700
But I'm really scared.

265
00:18:57,700 --> 00:18:59,700
Then I'll hold here.

266
00:18:59,700 --> 00:19:01,700
Don't let my hair fall.

267
00:19:03,700 --> 00:19:05,700
Here, hold this.

268
00:19:05,700 --> 00:19:07,700
I'll hold here.

269
00:19:11,700 --> 00:19:13,700
I can make a little war like this.

270
00:19:13,700 --> 00:19:17,700
Either war or plague.

271
00:19:23,700 --> 00:19:26,700
This is my own research on the Qingwen Baito.

272
00:19:26,700 --> 00:19:28,700
You guys hold this first.

273
00:19:28,700 --> 00:19:31,700
Try not to get into the real situation later.

274
00:19:31,700 --> 00:19:32,700
Or the animals.

275
00:19:32,700 --> 00:19:34,700
See the body run away.

276
00:19:36,700 --> 00:19:37,700
I...

277
00:19:46,700 --> 00:19:48,700
Why is it so sudden?

278
00:19:48,700 --> 00:19:51,700
There's no news in the capital.

279
00:19:51,700 --> 00:19:54,700
It's already severely damaged.

280
00:19:56,700 --> 00:19:58,700
Then let's split up and talk about it.

281
00:20:00,700 --> 00:20:02,700
Take care.

282
00:20:05,700 --> 00:20:07,700
Here.

283
00:20:07,700 --> 00:20:09,700
I'll get you.

284
00:20:09,700 --> 00:20:11,700
Xiaojiao, this is...

285
00:20:19,700 --> 00:20:21,700
Before we find out the cause of the plague,

286
00:20:21,700 --> 00:20:24,700
we need to get rid of this place first.

287
00:20:24,700 --> 00:20:27,700
So that the plague can be spread slowly.

288
00:20:27,700 --> 00:20:30,700
Zhao Yunzhou, Bai Ze Ling, come to me.

289
00:20:30,700 --> 00:20:32,700
Do you want to hold my hand?

290
00:20:33,700 --> 00:20:35,700
No problem.

291
00:20:35,700 --> 00:20:37,700
I'll go.

292
00:21:01,700 --> 00:21:03,700
Now he's going to kill you

293
00:21:03,700 --> 00:21:06,700
or kill your brother's murderer

294
00:21:06,700 --> 00:21:09,700
or the war that's unbearable?

295
00:21:11,700 --> 00:21:13,700
It's all true.

296
00:21:15,700 --> 00:21:17,700
But it doesn't matter.

297
00:21:18,700 --> 00:21:21,700
No matter what, I'll kill him myself.

298
00:21:22,700 --> 00:21:25,700
But now, half of Bai Ze Ling is with him.

299
00:21:25,700 --> 00:21:27,700
I can't do anything about it.

300
00:21:29,700 --> 00:21:31,700
Is that the reason?

301
00:21:34,700 --> 00:21:36,700
This time, I'll go to Mount Kunlun

302
00:21:36,700 --> 00:21:39,700
and find the way to cure Bai Ze Ling.

303
00:21:39,700 --> 00:21:42,700
I'll get the power to get back the power to cure Bai Ze Ling.

304
00:21:42,700 --> 00:21:45,700
At that time,

305
00:21:45,700 --> 00:21:48,700
I'll find him to clear all the problems.

306
00:21:51,700 --> 00:21:54,700
I didn't expect that I'd find Bai Ze Ling so soon.

307
00:21:55,700 --> 00:21:58,700
And I was so eager to find him.

308
00:21:58,700 --> 00:22:01,700
It seems that God is still

309
00:22:01,700 --> 00:22:04,700
protecting the world

310
00:22:04,700 --> 00:22:06,700
in the dark.

311
00:22:08,700 --> 00:22:10,700
I don't think so.

312
00:22:11,700 --> 00:22:13,700
What do you mean?

313
00:22:15,700 --> 00:22:17,700
I don't think it's God.

314
00:22:17,700 --> 00:22:19,700
It's human.

315
00:22:21,700 --> 00:22:24,700
The person who accompanied Si Heng suddenly appeared.

316
00:22:24,700 --> 00:22:27,700
That's why we investigated him.

317
00:22:27,700 --> 00:22:30,700
We found out the truth about Bai Ze Ling.

318
00:22:30,700 --> 00:22:33,700
Your brother's appearance is too much.

319
00:22:37,700 --> 00:22:39,700
You suspect my brother?

320
00:22:39,700 --> 00:22:42,700
I just suspect Cheng Huang's motive.

321
00:22:42,700 --> 00:22:45,700
Bai Si Heng has been controlled by Cheng Huang.

322
00:22:45,700 --> 00:22:47,700
And Cheng Huang went to guide us to catch him.

323
00:22:47,700 --> 00:22:49,700
Don't you think it's strange?

324
00:22:50,700 --> 00:22:54,700
I always think that we're like a human.

325
00:22:54,700 --> 00:22:56,700
There's a pair of hands behind us

326
00:22:56,700 --> 00:22:59,700
controlling us to go to the other side.

327
00:23:00,700 --> 00:23:03,700
The result is too clear.

328
00:23:03,700 --> 00:23:06,700
Everything goes as planned.

329
00:23:07,700 --> 00:23:12,700
This feeling makes me very anxious.

330
00:23:16,700 --> 00:23:18,700
Well,

331
00:23:19,700 --> 00:23:22,700
I'll go to the patrol room.

332
00:23:22,700 --> 00:23:25,700
I'll be alone.

333
00:23:30,700 --> 00:23:33,700
I'll go to the patrol room.

334
00:23:33,700 --> 00:23:36,700
I'll go to the patrol room.

335
00:23:36,700 --> 00:23:39,700
I'll go to the patrol room.

336
00:23:39,700 --> 00:23:42,700
I'll go to the patrol room.

337
00:23:42,700 --> 00:23:45,700
I'll go to the patrol room.

338
00:23:45,700 --> 00:23:48,700
I'll go to the patrol room.

339
00:23:48,700 --> 00:23:51,700
I'll go to the patrol room.

340
00:23:51,700 --> 00:23:54,700
I'll go to the patrol room.

341
00:23:54,700 --> 00:23:57,700
I'll go to the patrol room.

342
00:23:57,700 --> 00:24:00,700
I'll go to the patrol room.

343
00:24:00,700 --> 00:24:04,700
What are you doing here?

344
00:24:04,700 --> 00:24:07,700
Let me see if I can find the key here.

345
00:24:07,700 --> 00:24:10,700
I hope so.

346
00:24:10,700 --> 00:24:13,700
I'm going to the patrol room.

347
00:24:13,700 --> 00:24:16,700
I'll go to the patrol room.

348
00:24:16,700 --> 00:24:19,700
I'll go to the patrol room.

349
00:24:19,700 --> 00:24:22,700
What are you doing here?

350
00:24:22,700 --> 00:24:25,700
I'm going to the patrol room.

351
00:24:25,700 --> 00:24:28,700
I'll go to the patrol room.

352
00:24:28,700 --> 00:24:31,700
Is the key still open?

353
00:24:31,700 --> 00:24:34,700
Master.

354
00:24:38,700 --> 00:24:40,700
Mr. Du.

355
00:24:40,700 --> 00:24:43,700
Is that really you, Master?

356
00:24:43,700 --> 00:24:45,700
Why are you here?

357
00:24:45,700 --> 00:24:47,700
Uncle Xiao, what's so...

358
00:24:47,700 --> 00:24:49,700
I'm here.

359
00:24:49,700 --> 00:24:51,700
Master.

360
00:24:51,700 --> 00:24:53,700
You don't hear the bell.

361
00:24:53,700 --> 00:24:55,700
Why are you here?

362
00:24:55,700 --> 00:24:57,700
The water is so warm and cold

363
00:24:57,700 --> 00:24:59,700
I came here to see it

364
00:24:59,700 --> 00:25:03,700
But I didn't expect it to be so serious

365
00:25:04,700 --> 00:25:06,700
It started five days ago

366
00:25:07,700 --> 00:25:09,700
The doctor in the town had no idea

367
00:25:10,700 --> 00:25:12,700
He ran away after running away

368
00:25:12,700 --> 00:25:14,700
Run away?

369
00:25:14,700 --> 00:25:16,700
I don't know if he's going to the other town

370
00:25:16,700 --> 00:25:18,700
The town is always peaceful

371
00:25:18,700 --> 00:25:20,700
And the spirit of Mr. Kun is always there

372
00:25:20,700 --> 00:25:23,700
He's always been sick and unwell

373
00:25:23,700 --> 00:25:25,700
I heard that several hundred years ago

374
00:25:25,700 --> 00:25:26,700
There was a plague

375
00:25:26,700 --> 00:25:28,700
It was said that it was particularly serious

376
00:25:28,700 --> 00:25:31,700
The whole town was almost dead

377
00:25:32,700 --> 00:25:34,700
I don't know what will happen this time

378
00:25:35,700 --> 00:25:38,700
Master, you can't help it

379
00:25:38,700 --> 00:25:40,700
To cure this disease

380
00:25:40,700 --> 00:25:42,700
You have to find the right source

381
00:25:42,700 --> 00:25:44,700
The plague does not protect the spirit of the dead

382
00:25:44,700 --> 00:25:46,700
The spirit of the dead is not good

383
00:25:46,700 --> 00:25:48,700
The spirit of the dead is not good

384
00:25:48,700 --> 00:25:51,700
But I've checked it all

385
00:25:51,700 --> 00:25:53,700
It's not the right source

386
00:25:55,700 --> 00:25:56,700
It's not

387
00:25:56,700 --> 00:25:58,700
What can it be?

388
00:25:58,700 --> 00:26:00,700
Is there a monster in the town?

389
00:26:02,700 --> 00:26:04,700
Don't worry

390
00:26:04,700 --> 00:26:05,700
There is a mountain god to protect you

391
00:26:05,700 --> 00:26:06,700
What monster?

392
00:26:06,700 --> 00:26:07,700
What is it?

393
00:26:07,700 --> 00:26:09,700
You see, Xiaozhou

394
00:26:09,700 --> 00:26:10,700
Xiaozhou

395
00:26:10,700 --> 00:26:11,700
Xiaozhou

396
00:26:11,700 --> 00:26:12,700
Xiaozhou

397
00:26:12,700 --> 00:26:13,700
What's wrong?

398
00:26:13,700 --> 00:26:14,700
Xiaozhou

399
00:26:14,700 --> 00:26:15,700
Come on, come on

400
00:26:15,700 --> 00:26:16,700
I just talked to you

401
00:26:16,700 --> 00:26:17,700
Can I talk to you?

402
00:26:17,700 --> 00:26:18,700
You said

403
00:26:19,700 --> 00:26:20,700
This time

404
00:26:20,700 --> 00:26:22,700
It's my master

405
00:26:22,700 --> 00:26:24,700
It's also a master of the Tian Du plague

406
00:26:24,700 --> 00:26:27,700
I think Wen Zongyu is very good at it

407
00:26:30,700 --> 00:26:32,700
No wonder Xiaozhou is a god

408
00:26:32,700 --> 00:26:34,700
It turned out to be a doctor from Wen

409
00:26:35,700 --> 00:26:37,700
How is your tea over there?

410
00:26:38,700 --> 00:26:41,700
Zhao Yanzhou and Wenxiao found the source of the plague

411
00:26:41,700 --> 00:26:42,700
There should be a monster

412
00:26:42,700 --> 00:26:44,700
To follow here

413
00:26:44,700 --> 00:26:46,700
Monster

414
00:26:46,700 --> 00:26:49,700
If the monster is a monster

415
00:26:49,700 --> 00:26:52,700
Then my art can't be used

416
00:26:54,700 --> 00:26:55,700
Mr. Zhu

417
00:26:55,700 --> 00:26:58,700
I hope you can solve this problem

418
00:27:00,700 --> 00:27:01,700
By the way

419
00:27:03,700 --> 00:27:05,700
Can there be a doctor from Lanwen

420
00:27:05,700 --> 00:27:07,700
Take this J14-0 card

421
00:27:07,700 --> 00:27:09,700
Go to Fu Zhencheng's Ya Man to remove the disease

422
00:27:09,700 --> 00:27:11,700
temporarily closed

423
00:27:11,700 --> 00:27:12,700
Cut the cut out

424
00:27:12,700 --> 00:27:14,700
To avoid the spread of the disease

425
00:27:17,700 --> 00:27:19,700
I will definitely solve it

426
00:27:22,700 --> 00:27:24,700
Jiu'er, do you know what you want to do?

427
00:27:25,700 --> 00:27:26,700
Then I'll go

428
00:27:27,700 --> 00:27:29,700
Uncle Dan, don't worry

429
00:27:29,700 --> 00:27:31,700
You just leave it to me

430
00:27:47,700 --> 00:27:49,700
Did you see it?

431
00:27:56,700 --> 00:27:57,700
I saw it

432
00:28:00,700 --> 00:28:02,700
The red energy of the sky

433
00:28:06,700 --> 00:28:09,700
It's really the plague caused by the monster

434
00:28:11,700 --> 00:28:13,700
The red energy

435
00:28:13,700 --> 00:28:15,700
It's me

436
00:28:17,700 --> 00:28:20,700
Let's see if there's anything else

437
00:28:29,700 --> 00:28:31,700
The red energy

438
00:28:31,700 --> 00:28:34,700
Including these black monsters

439
00:28:34,700 --> 00:28:36,700
That's right

440
00:28:36,700 --> 00:28:38,700
Can you see the source?

441
00:28:39,700 --> 00:28:41,700
The man Wuino

442
00:28:45,700 --> 00:28:46,700
There

443
00:29:04,700 --> 00:29:05,800
Master of Guards

444
00:29:05,800 --> 00:29:09,240
Director Fan, are you really not worried?

445
00:29:09,240 --> 00:29:12,280
How can I focus on what you are doing?

446
00:29:13,560 --> 00:29:15,240
I'm leaving.

447
00:29:15,240 --> 00:29:18,160
I'll come with you to play chess some other day.

448
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:26,400
Guards.

449
00:29:29,560 --> 00:29:31,640
Leave this letter to Lord Zhuo immediately.

450
00:29:31,640 --> 00:29:33,040
Yes.

451
00:30:06,680 --> 00:30:08,000
Tell him to come.

452
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:09,080
Yes, say it.

453
00:30:15,080 --> 00:30:16,280
Turn things around here.

454
00:30:18,440 --> 00:30:19,320
Han Xiu.

455
00:30:32,920 --> 00:30:34,400
It's normal paper.

456
00:30:34,400 --> 00:30:39,200
Jum, you escaped one?

457
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:44,360
F greet Jum

458
00:30:53,640 --> 00:30:58,400
Cue Life

459
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:36,840
Third Uncle was split into two groups.

460
00:31:36,840 --> 00:31:39,000
But the rest fight together.

461
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:42,220
Thought they had chosen to...

462
00:31:42,220 --> 00:31:44,640
engage in bullfight.

463
00:31:57,560 --> 00:32:00,060
Third Uncle!

464
00:32:00,060 --> 00:32:03,060
With their ability, we can save Xiaojiu.

465
00:32:03,060 --> 00:32:05,060
We went to the commanding world.

466
00:32:05,060 --> 00:32:08,060
We'd better wait here for them to come back.

467
00:32:08,060 --> 00:32:10,060
I'll protect you.

468
00:32:22,060 --> 00:32:24,060
Jiang Zhongcheng!

469
00:32:30,060 --> 00:32:32,060
I'm here to protect you.

470
00:32:32,060 --> 00:32:34,060
I'm here to protect you.

471
00:32:34,060 --> 00:32:36,060
I'm here to protect you.

472
00:32:36,060 --> 00:32:38,060
I'm here to protect you.

473
00:32:38,060 --> 00:32:40,060
I'm here to protect you.

474
00:32:40,060 --> 00:32:42,060
I'm here to protect you.

475
00:32:42,060 --> 00:32:44,060
I'm here to protect you.

476
00:32:44,060 --> 00:32:46,060
I'm here to protect you.

477
00:32:46,060 --> 00:32:48,060
I'm here to protect you.

478
00:32:48,060 --> 00:32:50,060
I'm here to protect you.

479
00:32:50,060 --> 00:32:52,060
I'm here to protect you.

480
00:32:52,060 --> 00:32:54,060
I'm here to protect you.

481
00:32:54,060 --> 00:32:56,060
I'm here to protect you.

482
00:32:56,060 --> 00:32:58,060
I'm here to protect you.

483
00:32:58,060 --> 00:33:00,060
I'm here to protect you.

484
00:33:00,060 --> 00:33:02,060
I'm here to protect you.

485
00:33:02,060 --> 00:33:04,060
I'm here to protect you.

486
00:33:04,060 --> 00:33:06,060
I'm here to protect you.

487
00:33:06,060 --> 00:33:08,060
I'm here to protect you.

488
00:33:08,060 --> 00:33:10,060
I'm here to protect you.

489
00:33:10,060 --> 00:33:12,060
I'm here to protect you.

490
00:33:12,060 --> 00:33:14,060
I'm here to protect you.

491
00:33:14,060 --> 00:33:16,060
I'm here to protect you.

492
00:33:16,060 --> 00:33:18,060
I'm here to protect you.

493
00:33:18,060 --> 00:33:20,060
I'm here to protect you.

494
00:33:20,060 --> 00:33:22,060
I'm here to protect you.

495
00:33:22,060 --> 00:33:24,060
I'm here to protect you.

496
00:33:24,060 --> 00:33:26,060
I'm here to protect you.

497
00:33:27,060 --> 00:33:29,060
Who are you?

498
00:33:29,060 --> 00:33:31,060
Where is Xiao Jiu?

499
00:33:31,060 --> 00:33:32,060
Who are you?

500
00:33:32,660 --> 00:33:33,860
Where is Xiaojiu?

501
00:34:31,060 --> 00:34:33,060
Xiaojiu

502
00:35:01,060 --> 00:35:11,060
Xiaojiu

503
00:35:22,060 --> 00:35:23,060
Wake up

504
00:35:27,060 --> 00:35:28,060
Where is Xiaojiu?

505
00:35:28,060 --> 00:35:29,060
Where is Xiaojiu?

506
00:35:30,060 --> 00:35:31,060
Xiaojiu

507
00:35:32,060 --> 00:35:33,060
Xiaojiu

508
00:35:33,060 --> 00:35:34,060
Are you okay?

509
00:35:34,060 --> 00:35:35,060
Are you okay?

510
00:35:36,060 --> 00:35:37,060
Where is Xiaojiu?

511
00:35:38,060 --> 00:35:39,060
I saw Xiaojiu run in

512
00:35:40,060 --> 00:35:41,060
I followed him

513
00:35:41,060 --> 00:35:42,060
I didn't find Xiaojiu

514
00:35:42,060 --> 00:35:44,060
I found Xiaojiu first

515
00:35:58,060 --> 00:36:00,060
Where is Xiaojiu?

516
00:36:02,060 --> 00:36:03,060
Xiaojiu

517
00:36:04,060 --> 00:36:05,060
Xiaojiu

518
00:36:06,060 --> 00:36:07,060
Where is Xiaojiu?

519
00:36:09,060 --> 00:36:12,060
It seems that their goal is not Xiaojiu

520
00:36:13,060 --> 00:36:14,060
It's Master Zhuo

521
00:36:14,060 --> 00:36:16,060
The human world will not be destroyed

522
00:36:29,060 --> 00:36:31,060
It's Master Zhuo's blood

523
00:36:32,060 --> 00:36:34,060
Master Zhuo is injured

524
00:36:40,060 --> 00:36:41,060
Turn on the light

525
00:36:58,060 --> 00:36:59,260
Blue

526
00:37:17,060 --> 00:37:19,060
The sun when the moonfun

527
00:37:19,060 --> 00:37:21,060
How do you make it through the snowshoes

528
00:37:22,060 --> 00:37:24,740
Oceanic或hoj

529
00:37:25,060 --> 00:37:25,840
Red orшь

530
00:37:25,840 --> 00:37:28,040
Bring all the fırt in his land

531
00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:29,360
You must get the här

532
00:37:30,720 --> 00:37:33,640
And only thechinian queries if the one is armed

533
00:37:34,360 --> 00:37:36,100
If you want to take a樁

534
00:37:39,800 --> 00:37:40,760
Where shall we go?

535
00:37:51,640 --> 00:37:52,640
Here

536
00:37:55,840 --> 00:37:57,840
Okay.

537
00:38:05,840 --> 00:38:07,840
Red Mountain?

538
00:38:07,840 --> 00:38:10,840
You have a red mountain in this world, too?

539
00:38:15,840 --> 00:38:17,840
I have it here, too.

540
00:38:26,840 --> 00:38:28,840
What do you mean?

541
00:38:30,840 --> 00:38:32,840
Can't you tell? It's weird.

542
00:38:33,840 --> 00:38:35,840
I thought you were a dog.

543
00:38:39,840 --> 00:38:42,840
You are so rude to the Red Mountain God.

544
00:38:42,840 --> 00:38:44,840
You are so rude to me.

545
00:38:44,840 --> 00:38:46,840
You are rude to me.

546
00:38:49,840 --> 00:38:50,840
Taiyao.

547
00:38:52,840 --> 00:38:54,840
What are you doing?

548
00:38:54,840 --> 00:38:57,840
I want to experience the feeling of lying down.

549
00:38:57,840 --> 00:39:00,840
Wenxiao, do you want to come in and try it on?

550
00:39:00,840 --> 00:39:02,840
You should wear the wine.

551
00:39:02,840 --> 00:39:04,840
The candle is bleeding.

552
00:39:04,840 --> 00:39:06,840
You will definitely be hurt.

553
00:39:06,840 --> 00:39:09,840
Or wear a more safe clothes.

554
00:39:09,840 --> 00:39:12,840
Miss, you...

555
00:39:12,840 --> 00:39:15,840
learned this from this?

556
00:39:16,840 --> 00:39:18,840
I don't want to. I'll continue.

557
00:39:18,840 --> 00:39:20,840
I'm very close to him.

558
00:39:20,840 --> 00:39:22,840
Wenxiao, I'll take care of you.

559
00:39:25,840 --> 00:39:27,840
Wenxiao.

560
00:39:27,840 --> 00:39:29,840
Wenxiao.

561
00:39:52,840 --> 00:39:54,840
Zhang Yunzhou is so smart.

562
00:39:54,840 --> 00:39:56,840
There is a problem with this coffin.

563
00:39:58,840 --> 00:40:00,840

567
00:40:53,720 --> 00:40:55,320
Who are you?

568
00:40:56,840 --> 00:41:01,840
I'm going to use the same technique as the other one.

569
00:41:01,840 --> 00:41:06,840
I'm going to use the same technique as the other one.

570

I'm going to use the same technique as the other one.

578
00:41:47,840 --> 00:41:52,840
Who are you?

579
00:41:52,840 --> 00:41:55,840
Qing Geng.

580
00:41:55,840 --> 00:41:59,840
Yao.

581
00:41:59,840 --> 00:42:02,840
Yao.

582
00:42:02,840 --> 00:42:07,840
It's just that there's no Cloud Light Sword.

583
00:42:07,840 --> 00:42:12,840
The famous Chuo Yi Chen can only be treated as Yao.

584
00:42:13,840 --> 00:42:16,840
I didn't expect you to be so bold.

585
00:42:16,840 --> 00:42:20,840
How dare you pretend to be a soul mate and risk your life alone.

586
00:42:20,840 --> 00:42:23,840
You're indeed a good person.

587
00:42:23,840 --> 00:42:27,840
If I didn't pretend to be a soul mate, how would I know

588
00:42:27,840 --> 00:42:29,840
how you two were so close?

589
00:42:29,840 --> 00:42:33,840
As long as I kill Zhao Yanzhou and get his spy,

590
00:42:33,840 --> 00:42:38,840
when I complete my mission, I will give you the spy.

591
00:42:39,840 --> 00:42:43,840
You two want to kill Zhao Yanzhou's spy,

592
00:42:43,840 --> 00:42:46,840
but you can't kill him.

593
00:42:46,840 --> 00:42:50,840
You can only do it with my help.

594
00:42:50,840 --> 00:42:55,840
To be precise, it's your spy.

595
00:42:55,840 --> 00:42:59,840
Only the Cloud Light Sword can kill Zhao Yanzhou

596
00:42:59,840 --> 00:43:03,840
and get his spy.

597
00:43:03,840 --> 00:43:06,840
Who brought me here?

598
00:43:06,840 --> 00:43:08,840
You don't need to know.

599
00:43:08,840 --> 00:43:12,840
If you don't tell me who the person behind me is,

600
00:43:12,840 --> 00:43:19,840
why would I definitely kill Zhao Yanzhou for you?

601
00:43:22,840 --> 00:43:24,840
Interesting.

602
00:43:24,840 --> 00:43:27,840
You killed your father's enemy.

603
00:43:27,840 --> 00:43:31,840
You really treated him as a partner who fought in the ice palace.

604
00:43:31,840 --> 00:43:34,840
I will kill him.

605
00:43:34,840 --> 00:43:37,840
But you two don't care.

606
00:43:39,840 --> 00:43:43,840
The man's thoughts are really weird.

607
00:43:43,840 --> 00:43:48,840
I helped you to avenge, but I didn't understand.

608
00:43:57,840 --> 00:44:00,840
This is the assassination of the killer,

609
00:44:00,840 --> 00:44:05,840
but I didn't expect it to be me.

610
00:44:05,840 --> 00:44:08,840
They all said that the monster can write a letter,

611
00:44:08,840 --> 00:44:12,840
but no one cares about it.

612
00:44:12,840 --> 00:44:18,840
The truth will make people suffer.

613
00:44:18,840 --> 00:44:21,840
I can't beg for death.

614
00:44:22,840 --> 00:44:25,840
I'm sorry.

615
00:44:29,840 --> 00:44:33,840
I didn't expect you could still fight with the Cloud Light Sword.

616
00:44:33,840 --> 00:44:36,840
Are you okay?

617
00:44:52,840 --> 00:44:57,840
Are you his father?

618
00:45:01,840 --> 00:45:05,840
I will only follow my heart.

619
00:45:05,840 --> 00:45:08,840
I won't be held responsible for anyone.

620
00:45:10,840 --> 00:45:15,840
You said that people are greedy, cowardly, selfish.

621
00:45:15,840 --> 00:45:18,840
For the sake of the purpose, you are not responsible.

622
00:45:19,840 --> 00:45:22,840
You are different.

623
00:45:24,840 --> 00:45:27,840
You can try.

624
00:45:27,840 --> 00:45:33,840
Okay. Since Lord Zhuo is innocent,

625
00:45:36,840 --> 00:45:39,840
how about this?

626
00:45:40,840 --> 00:45:44,840
Kill Zhao Yanzhou for me.

627
00:45:44,840 --> 00:45:47,840
Together.

628
00:45:48,840 --> 00:45:52,840
You will help me, right?

629
00:45:56,840 --> 00:46:00,840
Say it. Are you willing?

630
00:46:02,840 --> 00:46:05,840
Yes.

631
00:46:39,840 --> 00:46:42,840
I will do it.

632
00:46:42,840 --> 00:46:45,840
I will do it.

633
00:46:45,840 --> 00:46:48,840
I will do it.

634
00:46:48,840 --> 00:46:51,840
I will do it.

635
00:46:51,840 --> 00:46:54,840
I will do it.

636
00:46:54,840 --> 00:46:57,840
I will do it.

637
00:46:57,840 --> 00:47:00,840
I will do it.

638
00:47:00,840 --> 00:47:03,840
I will do it.

639
00:47:03,840 --> 00:47:06,840
I will do it.

640
00:47:06,840 --> 00:47:09,840
I will do it.

641
00:47:09,840 --> 00:47:12,840
I will do it.

642
00:47:12,840 --> 00:47:15,840
I will do it.

643
00:47:15,840 --> 00:47:18,840
I will do it.

644
00:47:18,840 --> 00:47:21,840
I will do it.

645
00:47:21,840 --> 00:47:24,840
I will do it.

646
00:47:24,840 --> 00:47:27,840
I will do it.

647
00:47:27,840 --> 00:47:30,840
I will do it.

648
00:47:30,840 --> 00:47:33,840
I will do it.

649
00:47:33,840 --> 00:47:36,840
I will do it.
