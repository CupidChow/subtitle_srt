♫Nourished gently by rain♫

10
00:02:02,590 --> 00:02:04,229

♫The window opened by the wind♫

12
00:02:05,030 --> 00:02:07,150
protecting the peace of the Wilderness.

♫Blossom♫

26
00:03:02,790 --> 00:03:04,660
I thought the Goddess and I

27
00:03:05,990 --> 00:03:07,670
could be like this forever

28
00:03:08,750 --> 00:03:10,550
and never go back on our promise.

29
00:03:11,630 --> 00:03:12,950
But I didn't expect...

30
00:03:35,190 --> 00:03:36,030
Mom.

31
00:03:36,030 --> 00:03:37,730
What’s this mark?

32
00:03:38,070 --> 00:03:40,890
This is the mark of the Baize Order.

33
00:03:41,070 --> 00:03:42,270
Only with this mark

34
00:03:42,270 --> 00:03:43,310
can we hide our demonic energy

35
00:03:43,310 --> 00:03:45,350
in the mortal world

36
00:03:45,470 --> 00:03:47,590
and avoid troubles.

37
00:03:48,310 --> 00:03:49,790
The Baize Order is the reason

38
00:03:49,790 --> 00:03:50,579
why the Human Realm

39
00:03:50,579 --> 00:03:52,510
and the Demon Realm have been at peace.

40
00:03:52,510 --> 00:03:54,570
Be good when you go to the Human Realm.

41
00:04:29,940 --> 00:04:30,740
Fei.

42
00:04:31,930 --> 00:04:33,520
You're a disaster beast.

43
00:04:34,150 --> 00:04:36,310
Once you're seen by people, you'll bring a serious plague.

44
00:04:36,310 --> 00:04:37,870
Wherever you go,

45
00:04:37,870 --> 00:04:39,710
you'll cause massive deaths.

46
00:04:39,830 --> 00:04:42,230
I can't allow you to go to the mortal world.

47
00:05:24,930 --> 00:05:26,950
I searched the entire Wilderness,

48
00:05:27,850 --> 00:05:30,400
but I couldn't find a way to cure the plague.

49
00:05:35,030 --> 00:05:36,510
I told myself that

50
00:05:38,100 --> 00:05:40,400
I must save her

51
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:43,540
no matter what it takes.

52
00:05:45,060 --> 00:05:48,060
Did you kill so many demons in the Wilderness back then

53
00:05:48,170 --> 00:05:50,640
just to extend the Goddess's life?

54
00:05:51,470 --> 00:05:52,820
I told you

55
00:05:54,630 --> 00:05:56,970
as long as she could live,

56
00:05:59,180 --> 00:06:01,840
I'd pay any price.

57
00:06:02,659 --> 00:06:04,659
You shoulder the responsibility of managing the Baize Order.

58
00:06:04,659 --> 00:06:07,120
You're supposed to protect the Wilderness,

59
00:06:07,310 --> 00:06:10,570
yet you disregarded the lives of demons in the Wilderness.

60
00:06:12,310 --> 00:06:14,150
You committed a heinous crime,

61
00:06:15,210 --> 00:06:17,270
yet you said it was just a price to pay.

62
00:06:18,010 --> 00:06:19,500
The Baize Goddess

63
00:06:19,900 --> 00:06:21,900
was meant to exist for guarding

64
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:23,450
the peace of the two realms.

65
00:06:24,420 --> 00:06:26,690
If I couldn't even save the Goddess,

66
00:06:27,630 --> 00:06:29,960
how could I possibly save the Wilderness?

67
00:06:36,610 --> 00:06:38,390
For her, I had to

68
00:06:39,830 --> 00:06:41,409
take a chance.

69
00:06:41,670 --> 00:06:44,270
So, was she willing to let you take that chance?

70
00:06:46,590 --> 00:06:48,570
You have the power of the universe,

71
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:50,880
yet you used it to kill the innocent.

72
00:06:51,750 --> 00:06:53,080
Do you admit your crime?

73
00:06:55,080 --> 00:06:56,510
I killed the innocent.

74
00:06:58,230 --> 00:06:59,820
I know my sins

75
00:07:01,510 --> 00:07:03,180
are unforgivable.

76
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:10,690
Since you know it's wrong,

77
00:07:12,230 --> 00:07:14,090
why are you still so unrepentant?

78
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:16,540
That's because...

79
00:07:31,540 --> 00:07:33,930
That's because they were unruly

80
00:07:34,930 --> 00:07:36,500
and fled the Wilderness.

81
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:39,470
They deserved to die.

82
00:07:50,210 --> 00:07:52,200
No matter what your purpose was,

83
00:07:53,770 --> 00:07:55,380
it's unacceptable.

84
00:07:58,020 --> 00:07:59,450
You are no longer

85
00:08:00,710 --> 00:08:03,190
fit to be in charge of the Baize Order.

86
00:08:16,350 --> 00:08:18,730
I'm taking back that half in you.

87
00:09:45,300 --> 00:09:47,230
The Goddess's original intention

88
00:09:47,370 --> 00:09:49,160
was to seal me.

89
00:09:51,530 --> 00:09:53,260
But she was infected by plague,

90
00:09:53,740 --> 00:09:55,740
and her magical power was weakened.

91
00:10:36,920 --> 00:10:39,040
I took advantage of her exhaustion

92
00:10:39,060 --> 00:10:39,970
and escaped.

93
00:11:00,100 --> 00:11:02,130
I've been hiding in the Wilderness.

94
00:11:02,590 --> 00:11:04,750
I wanted to kill more demons in secret

95
00:11:05,630 --> 00:11:07,090
to extend her life.

96
00:11:08,470 --> 00:11:11,540
You killed others just for your loved one.

97
00:11:13,110 --> 00:11:14,470
You're way too crazy.

98
00:11:15,950 --> 00:11:17,280
You don't even regret it

99
00:11:17,520 --> 00:11:20,700
or feel guilty about the heinous crimes you've committed.

100
00:11:20,700 --> 00:11:22,300
Who said I don't regret it?

101
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:24,960
I do regret it.

102
00:11:27,430 --> 00:11:29,720
I regret that I didn't do enough

103
00:11:31,780 --> 00:11:33,590
to save her.

104
00:11:36,030 --> 00:11:38,630
Perhaps the Goddess already knew everything.

105
00:11:38,910 --> 00:11:41,200
She didn't want you to make more mistakes,

106
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:42,920
so she committed suicide.

107
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:46,150
What did you say?

108
00:11:48,570 --> 00:11:50,900
But the Goddess has passed away years ago.

109
00:11:52,190 --> 00:11:54,860
Why are you killing the innocent again?

110
00:11:56,870 --> 00:11:58,090
Zhao Yuanzhou.

111
00:12:00,410 --> 00:12:01,970
What is your desire?

112
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:05,390
All emotions and desires.

113
00:12:05,990 --> 00:12:07,260
Everything.

114
00:12:08,040 --> 00:12:09,920
And what do you want the most?

115
00:12:10,070 --> 00:12:11,420
I can get

116
00:12:12,340 --> 00:12:14,100
basically whatever I want.

117
00:12:17,590 --> 00:12:18,660
You're right.

118
00:12:20,460 --> 00:12:21,710
You're immortal,

119
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:24,200
and you can never die of any injury.

120
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:26,890
This super power you were born with

121
00:12:27,850 --> 00:12:29,890
is enough to make all the demons

122
00:12:30,530 --> 00:12:32,250
envy you.

123
00:12:33,560 --> 00:12:34,910
The rest of my life

124
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:37,580
will be like traveling in the dark night,

125
00:12:37,580 --> 00:12:38,820
with no light ahead.

126
00:12:40,790 --> 00:12:41,950
There's no past

127
00:12:42,470 --> 00:12:44,010
and no future.

128
00:12:45,310 --> 00:12:47,800
Maybe I'm the opposite of everyone else.

129
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,680
For me, living is torture.

130
00:12:52,180 --> 00:12:53,260
Death

131
00:12:54,430 --> 00:12:56,720
is actually a blessing and relief.

132
00:12:59,260 --> 00:13:00,780
Since you want to die,

133
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:03,780
why don't you go for it?

134
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:07,800
This is a world of misery and suffering.

135
00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:10,300
It's hard to get my wish granted.

136
00:13:15,340 --> 00:13:16,910
I can help you.

137
00:13:17,270 --> 00:13:18,400
That won't do.

138
00:13:19,420 --> 00:13:21,590
I've promised someone else.

139
00:13:22,190 --> 00:13:23,690
He'll come to kill me.

140
00:13:30,870 --> 00:13:32,370
He doesn't deserve it.

141
00:13:38,760 --> 00:13:41,270
Since Zhao Yuanzhou wants to die,

142
00:13:41,880 --> 00:13:43,160
how about I help you

143
00:13:43,530 --> 00:13:45,020
kill him?

144
00:13:46,110 --> 00:13:48,060
Then your wish will come true.

145
00:13:49,230 --> 00:13:49,950
And he

146
00:13:51,010 --> 00:13:52,740
can disappear once and for all.

147
00:13:53,660 --> 00:13:55,420
This is between me and him.

148
00:13:57,430 --> 00:13:59,310
I must kill him myself.

149
00:14:02,150 --> 00:14:03,860
I don't need anyone's help.

150
00:14:08,690 --> 00:14:10,750
It's been tens of thousands of years,

151
00:14:11,790 --> 00:14:13,830
yet humans are still so stupid.

152
00:14:20,700 --> 00:14:22,560
I made a big mistake back then,

153
00:14:23,030 --> 00:14:24,830
killing demons to extend my life

154
00:14:26,490 --> 00:14:28,820
and letting the Goddess die with regrets.

155
00:14:31,790 --> 00:14:33,160
So I thought,

156
00:14:34,910 --> 00:14:36,880
if I could go back to the past,

157
00:14:37,980 --> 00:14:40,310
back to when she was healthy and carefree,

158
00:14:40,860 --> 00:14:42,720
back to when there hadn't been

159
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:45,730
any blood on my hands,

160
00:14:48,470 --> 00:14:49,580
back to

161
00:14:51,550 --> 00:14:54,290
when we were still together...

162
00:14:55,390 --> 00:14:56,920
What are you planning to do?

163
00:15:03,590 --> 00:15:05,510
Rewind the clock

164
00:15:06,420 --> 00:15:08,420
and go back in time.

165
00:15:22,350 --> 00:15:24,880
This magical instrument, sundial, can do it.

166
00:15:25,270 --> 00:15:28,220
As long as I grant enough mortals' wishes,

167
00:15:29,080 --> 00:15:30,640
this magical instrument

168
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:33,300
will gradually become stronger.

169
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:36,830
One day,

170
00:15:37,870 --> 00:15:40,080
it'll be able to turn things around

171
00:15:40,790 --> 00:15:42,150
and bring back the past.

172
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:47,600
This way, I can go back to the time before the Goddess was infected by plague,

173
00:15:47,670 --> 00:15:48,590
and back to

174
00:15:51,050 --> 00:15:53,710
when everything wasn't too late.

175
00:15:56,500 --> 00:15:57,700
Why are you sneering?

176
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,460
Because you're dreaming.

177
00:16:00,790 --> 00:16:02,470
Go back to the past

178
00:16:03,220 --> 00:16:04,880
and turn things around.

179
00:16:06,970 --> 00:16:08,900
Is that what Li Lun told you?

180
00:16:09,710 --> 00:16:10,710
That's right.

181
00:16:10,740 --> 00:16:12,390
Why did he give you this?

182
00:16:12,870 --> 00:16:14,630
Because he wants to know

183
00:16:15,130 --> 00:16:16,920
the secret of the Baize Order.

184
00:16:17,430 --> 00:16:19,490
What's the secret of the Baize Order?

185
00:16:26,570 --> 00:16:27,850
You’re so pitiful.

186
00:16:28,670 --> 00:16:30,200
You were deceived by Li Lun.

187
00:16:37,730 --> 00:16:39,620
Li Lun didn't deceive me.

188
00:16:40,750 --> 00:16:43,180
It's you rat, Zhu Yan,

189
00:16:44,070 --> 00:16:45,730
who wants to deceive me.

190
00:16:46,810 --> 00:16:48,110
This sundial

191
00:16:49,270 --> 00:16:52,560
is the magical instrument I found with Li Lun back then.

192
00:16:53,630 --> 00:16:55,520
It only has one function,

193
00:16:56,270 --> 00:16:58,020
which is to store memory.

194
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:00,660
It can't rewind the clock.

195
00:17:25,050 --> 00:17:25,780
Sister.

196
00:17:25,800 --> 00:17:29,530
The dress is beautiful, but it's inconvenient to walk around in it.

197
00:17:38,660 --> 00:17:39,920
See?

198
00:17:41,050 --> 00:17:43,570
In this world, the Human Realm and the Demon realm

199
00:17:43,570 --> 00:17:45,190
share the same origin.

200
00:17:45,810 --> 00:17:48,070
There will never be a magical instrument

201
00:17:48,300 --> 00:17:51,030
that can rewind the clock and turn things around.

202
00:17:52,870 --> 00:17:53,880
Cheng Huang.

203
00:17:55,900 --> 00:17:57,220
The ending is settled.

204
00:17:59,180 --> 00:18:01,090
The past is the past.

205
00:18:02,690 --> 00:18:04,300
No way.

206
00:18:07,030 --> 00:18:08,630
You're lying to me.

207
00:18:12,030 --> 00:18:13,630
You must be lying to me.

208
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:18,150
The one who lied to you

209
00:18:20,050 --> 00:18:21,000
is Li Lun.

210
00:18:33,310 --> 00:18:34,380
He's gone crazy.

211
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:37,080
He has too many desires,

212
00:18:37,270 --> 00:18:38,960
and he's too involved to see the big picture.

213
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:39,910
Cheng Huang.

214
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:43,800
You were willing to be deceived by Li Lun.

215
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,800
Everyone has their own regrets,

216
00:18:48,860 --> 00:18:50,460
but the way of Heaven is fair.

217
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:53,400
There's no turning back in everything.

218
00:18:53,890 --> 00:18:54,930
Cheng Huang.

219
00:18:55,260 --> 00:18:56,820
Be realistic.

220
00:18:57,670 --> 00:18:59,950
Stop being obsessed with the past.

221
00:19:00,390 --> 00:19:02,070
It's all water under the bridge now.

222
00:19:02,070 --> 00:19:04,930
Turn around and mend your ways before it's too late.

223
00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:09,700
I won't accept it!

224
00:19:28,140 --> 00:19:29,070
Cheng Huang is the demon

225
00:19:29,070 --> 00:19:30,810
that has lived the longest in the Wilderness.

226
00:19:30,810 --> 00:19:32,640
He's suffered such a great shock.

227
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:33,390
I'm afraid even Brother Zhuo

228
00:19:33,390 --> 00:19:35,790
and Great Demon can't do anything about it.

229
00:21:05,720 --> 00:21:07,340
The original Baize Token

230
00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:09,440
was divided into two halves.

231
00:21:09,470 --> 00:21:11,030
It was jointly managed by the Original Goddess

232
00:21:11,030 --> 00:21:13,550
and the strongest great demon

233
00:21:13,630 --> 00:21:15,280
of the Wilderness.

234
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:18,720
Turns out I have that half.

235
00:22:10,550 --> 00:22:12,390
Bless everything.

236
00:22:12,600 --> 00:22:14,460
Invulnerable to all evil.

237
00:22:14,670 --> 00:22:16,350
We promise to work together

238
00:22:16,520 --> 00:22:18,960
and guard the Wilderness.

Baize Token.

00:23:40,270 --> 00:23:41,880
I've finally got you back.

251
00:25:24,780 --> 00:25:26,260
Since they asked me to guard here,

252
00:25:26,260 --> 00:25:27,420
I won't

253
00:25:27,450 --> 00:25:28,970
let anyone in.

254
00:25:29,050 --> 00:25:30,550
You and whose army?

255
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:40,140
The Baize Token has returned?

256
00:25:52,620 --> 00:25:53,420
Hey.

257
00:25:54,440 --> 00:25:55,240
Hey!

258
00:26:04,540 --> 00:26:06,860
The Baize Token has returned.

259
00:26:08,860 --> 00:26:12,690
It's indeed delightful.

260
00:26:23,870 --> 00:26:25,830
It seems that

261
00:26:26,980 --> 00:26:28,450
very soon,

262
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:31,860
my wish will come true.

263
00:27:02,300 --> 00:27:03,460
I'm not going.

264
00:27:03,560 --> 00:27:04,730
It's too scary.

265
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:14,450
How could this be?

266
00:27:15,810 --> 00:27:18,140
Shouldn't he have been sealed

267
00:27:18,340 --> 00:27:20,080
and sent to his place of birth?

268
00:27:20,530 --> 00:27:22,850
Could it be that since he's lived for too long,

269
00:27:22,850 --> 00:27:25,290
the Baize Order no longer works on him?

270
00:27:26,260 --> 00:27:27,140
That can't be.

271
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:30,640
All demons are under the Baize Order's control.

272
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:32,030
As long as he's a demon,

273
00:27:32,390 --> 00:27:33,990
he'll definitely be sealed.

274
00:27:35,290 --> 00:27:36,380
Unless...

275
00:27:37,630 --> 00:27:39,230
Look at Cheng Huang's hands.

276
00:27:45,920 --> 00:27:46,810
Could it be...

277
00:27:47,070 --> 00:27:48,500
He's also a puppet?

278
00:27:56,140 --> 00:27:57,350
Appear.

279
00:28:07,320 --> 00:28:10,840
If I could rewind the clock,

280
00:28:11,030 --> 00:28:12,400
then she

281
00:28:13,230 --> 00:28:15,670
could smile again.

282
00:28:17,510 --> 00:28:19,310

341
00:31:14,030 --> 00:31:15,470
as to make a puppet

342
00:31:15,550 --> 00:31:18,670
as powerful as a real great demon.

343
00:31:32,610 --> 00:31:33,940
Something's not right.

344
00:31:36,520 --> 00:31:38,410
We've dealt with Cheng Huang.

345
00:31:39,240 --> 00:31:41,040
Why hasn't the sundial illusion

346
00:31:41,480 --> 00:31:43,270
dissipated?

347
00:31:48,250 --> 00:31:48,950
This sundial

348
00:31:48,950 --> 00:31:51,180
was found by you and Li Lun.

349
00:31:51,210 --> 00:31:53,150
Zhao Yuanzhou, do something.

350
00:31:54,090 --> 00:31:55,490
There's nothing I can do.

351
00:31:55,870 --> 00:31:58,270
But I believe the Goddess can do something.

352
00:31:58,430 --> 00:31:59,230
Me?

353
00:32:02,530 --> 00:32:04,330
Take a look at it, and you'll see.

354
00:32:10,800 --> 00:32:11,600
So beautiful.

355
00:32:14,810 --> 00:32:15,850
Wen Xiao.

356
00:32:16,190 --> 00:32:18,000
Why did you say it out loud?

357
00:32:20,750 --> 00:32:21,990
I mean

358
00:32:22,020 --> 00:32:24,150
these golden pupils are so beautiful.

359
00:32:33,410 --> 00:32:35,040
Will those eyes

360
00:32:35,060 --> 00:32:36,470
be like this forever?

361
00:32:36,940 --> 00:32:39,350
Only when she uses the power of the Baize Order

362
00:32:39,350 --> 00:32:41,020
will her pupils turn golden.

363
00:32:42,190 --> 00:32:43,580
You said there's something I can do.

364
00:32:43,580 --> 00:32:45,370
Do you mean by using these golden pupils?

365
00:32:45,370 --> 00:32:47,690
It's actually not hard to find the exit of the sundial.

366
00:32:47,690 --> 00:32:50,580
The Golden Pupils of Baize can break through any illusion.

367
00:32:50,580 --> 00:32:51,870
It's actually a more powerful version

368
00:32:51,870 --> 00:32:52,800
of the Truth Eye.

369
00:32:54,390 --> 00:32:56,600
You have the power of the Baize Goddess.

370
00:32:56,720 --> 00:32:59,000
Motivate the power in your blood.

371
00:32:59,580 --> 00:33:00,950
Where your will is,

372
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:02,850
you can see the truth.

373
00:33:05,900 --> 00:33:07,600
Where my will is,

374
00:33:09,160 --> 00:33:10,720
I can see the truth.

375
00:33:31,760 --> 00:33:34,240
♫A lone boat drifts through the world♫

376
00:33:34,300 --> 00:33:36,900
♫The heart feels bitter, then sweet♫

377
00:33:37,240 --> 00:33:42,310
♫Can't distinguish night from day♫

378
00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:45,520
♫At the edge of the dreamscape♫

379
00:33:45,630 --> 00:33:48,200
♫Someone is longing for♫

380
00:33:48,320 --> 00:33:49,560
♫Softly calling for♫

381
00:33:49,800 --> 00:33:53,860
♫A past that can't be brought back♫

382
00:33:51,150 --> 00:33:52,070
We're back.

383
00:33:52,880 --> 00:33:54,120
Everything

384
00:33:55,060 --> 00:33:56,900
is like a dream.

385
00:34:00,670 --> 00:34:02,440
Since Ran Yi's case,

386
00:34:03,790 --> 00:34:06,190
it's like I've been having endless dreams.

387
00:34:10,190 --> 00:34:12,320
Now that the Baize Order has returned,

388
00:34:13,790 --> 00:34:16,270
Master should be at ease now.

389
00:34:19,030 --> 00:34:20,790
The moonlight is so beautiful tonight.

390
00:34:20,790 --> 00:34:21,870
Zhuo told me that

391
00:34:21,889 --> 00:34:23,690
most of those who say things like

392
00:34:23,790 --> 00:34:25,520
"the moonlight is like water",

393
00:34:26,190 --> 00:34:27,270
or "how can we

394
00:34:27,270 --> 00:34:28,800
fail this beautiful scene"

395
00:34:29,590 --> 00:34:31,580
have ulterior motives

396
00:34:31,980 --> 00:34:33,460
and evil intentions.

397
00:34:34,610 --> 00:34:35,400
Is that so?

398
00:34:42,510 --> 00:34:44,190
I've always wondered

399
00:34:45,270 --> 00:34:46,730
what kind of water this is.

400
00:34:47,870 --> 00:34:48,909
Let me try it.

401
00:35:07,540 --> 00:35:08,660
It's so bitter.

402
00:35:12,070 --> 00:35:13,790
The world is full of hardships.

403
00:35:13,790 --> 00:35:15,040
Life is suffering.

404
00:35:15,260 --> 00:35:16,600
I’m no exception.

405
00:35:18,080 --> 00:35:20,060
You love acting so much.

406
00:35:20,090 --> 00:35:21,470
I suspect your true form

407
00:35:21,470 --> 00:35:22,390
is not a monkey,

408
00:35:22,530 --> 00:35:23,850
but an opera stage.

409
00:35:24,500 --> 00:35:26,280
I'm a noble white ape, okay?

410
00:35:26,830 --> 00:35:28,270
I've said it 100 times.

411
00:35:29,180 --> 00:35:30,390
You seem to be writing

412
00:35:30,390 --> 00:35:32,510
on your notebook every day,

413
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:34,130
but it's useless at all.

414
00:35:48,040 --> 00:35:49,650
So what are you drinking?

415
00:35:49,720 --> 00:35:50,810
Pear soup.

416
00:35:52,950 --> 00:35:54,410
I want a sip too.

417
00:35:55,690 --> 00:35:57,540
Zhuo made a big pot.

418
00:35:58,160 --> 00:35:59,960
I'll ask him to get you a bowl.

419
00:36:01,840 --> 00:36:03,140
No need.

420
00:36:16,770 --> 00:36:19,030
I want to take a trip back to Mount Kunlun.

421
00:36:21,650 --> 00:36:23,560
With my current situation,

422
00:36:24,320 --> 00:36:27,380
I'm not suitable for managing the Baize Token with you.

423
00:36:27,860 --> 00:36:29,550
I haven't found the key

424
00:36:29,570 --> 00:36:31,960
to putting the two halves of the Baize Token together.

425
00:36:31,960 --> 00:36:33,440
So I want to go back to the Wilderness

426
00:36:33,440 --> 00:36:36,040
to see if the old Mountain Gods like Ying Zhao

427
00:36:37,350 --> 00:36:38,810
have any ideas.

428
00:36:41,220 --> 00:36:42,840
So as a great demon,

429
00:36:43,210 --> 00:36:45,340
there are also times you feel inferior

430
00:36:45,650 --> 00:36:47,580
and feel like you don't deserve it?

431
00:36:49,880 --> 00:36:50,950
You are a Goddess,

432
00:36:52,430 --> 00:36:54,490
yet you feel inferior too, don't you?

433
00:37:05,310 --> 00:37:06,370
In the past,

434
00:37:07,620 --> 00:37:10,510
when all demons first heard my name,

435
00:37:11,980 --> 00:37:13,380
they were either afraid,

436
00:37:14,150 --> 00:37:15,220
awed,

437
00:37:16,700 --> 00:37:18,100
or delighted.

438
00:37:21,030 --> 00:37:23,160
But soon after, they found out that

439
00:37:24,010 --> 00:37:25,840
I don't have any divine power,

440
00:37:26,660 --> 00:37:28,490
and I can't help them

441
00:37:29,080 --> 00:37:30,790
or discipline them.

442
00:37:34,190 --> 00:37:36,030
That's why I learned so much knowledge

443
00:37:36,030 --> 00:37:37,480
about demons

444
00:37:38,510 --> 00:37:40,430
in the hope that I could help them.

445
00:37:46,790 --> 00:37:48,190
But

446
00:37:49,270 --> 00:37:51,070
it's still useless.

447
00:37:56,280 --> 00:37:57,430
That's not true.

448
00:37:58,180 --> 00:38:00,310
You know even more than me, a great demon

449
00:38:00,310 --> 00:38:02,040
who has lived for 30,000 years.

450
00:38:02,550 --> 00:38:04,810
Besides, with the Baize Order's return,

451
00:38:04,910 --> 00:38:06,910
you won't get any weaker from now on.

452
00:38:07,210 --> 00:38:09,220
You'll get better

453
00:38:09,660 --> 00:38:11,530
and become more and more capable.

454
00:38:13,100 --> 00:38:15,070
No wonder on the way back from Qinghu,

455
00:38:15,070 --> 00:38:16,150
Zhuo said

456
00:38:16,870 --> 00:38:19,000
he felt like my physique had improved.

457
00:38:19,730 --> 00:38:22,790
Although I fell into the trap of Ran Yi's dream control magic,

458
00:38:22,790 --> 00:38:24,790
my body wasn't affected.

459
00:38:26,550 --> 00:38:28,370
Maybe it's because

460
00:38:29,110 --> 00:38:30,830
you've been by my side.

461
00:38:31,910 --> 00:38:34,110
That half of the Baize Token in your body

462
00:38:34,470 --> 00:38:36,090
has been giving me power

463
00:38:37,050 --> 00:38:38,110
and protecting me.

464
00:38:39,370 --> 00:38:42,340
Is Baize Token the only thing that's been protecting you?

465
00:38:42,340 --> 00:38:43,490
What about me?

466
00:38:48,170 --> 00:38:49,230
Alright. Alright.

467
00:38:50,450 --> 00:38:52,240
You're really something.

468
00:38:52,430 --> 00:38:55,630
Now you can control me, a big white ape, with just one look.

469
00:38:55,790 --> 00:38:56,600
Impressive.

470
00:39:02,710 --> 00:39:04,970
It doesn't matter if I can't control you.

471
00:39:06,670 --> 00:39:08,060
But I want to cure you.

472
00:39:09,530 --> 00:39:11,130
Why?

473
00:39:11,360 --> 00:39:12,330
I'm not sick.

474
00:39:14,350 --> 00:39:15,500
You are.

475
00:39:19,890 --> 00:39:20,710
Here.

476
00:39:37,840 --> 00:39:40,300
You actually want to cure a great evil demon?

477
00:39:40,730 --> 00:39:42,040
You're also sick.

478
00:39:42,700 --> 00:39:43,430
Here.

479
00:39:48,200 --> 00:39:50,100
When are we leaving for Kunlun?

480
00:39:50,120 --> 00:39:51,670
I'll go to Kunlun with you.

481
00:39:57,550 --> 00:39:58,710
Mr. Zhuo.

482
00:39:59,800 --> 00:40:03,200
I don't trust this demon. I don't want you to be alone with him.

483
00:40:04,810 --> 00:40:06,560
Mr. Zhuo...

484
00:40:14,820 --> 00:40:15,820
Take me with you.

485
00:40:18,310 --> 00:40:19,270
Brother Zhuo.

486
00:40:19,350 --> 00:40:20,480
Take me with you.

487
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:23,680
Sure.

488
00:40:24,390 --> 00:40:25,340
Great.

489
00:40:27,540 --> 00:40:28,310
Mr. Zhuo.

490
00:40:28,320 --> 00:40:31,120
What delicious food are you carrying in your hand?

491
00:40:34,530 --> 00:40:35,480
Pear soup.

492
00:40:37,290 --> 00:40:39,220
Wen Xiao has had it.

493
00:40:39,240 --> 00:40:41,070
So is it for me?

494
00:40:42,330 --> 00:40:43,060
Ridiculous.

495
00:40:43,570 --> 00:40:45,230
I'm feeding it to the dogs.

496
00:40:48,590 --> 00:40:50,740
Wen Xiao, that's not what I meant.

497
00:40:52,800 --> 00:40:53,600
I...

498
00:40:54,500 --> 00:40:55,320
You...

499
00:41:04,650 --> 00:41:06,060
Jiu.

500
00:41:11,990 --> 00:41:12,750
Brother Zhuo.

501
00:41:12,750 --> 00:41:14,030
Wait for me.

502
00:41:14,030 --> 00:41:14,830
Brother Zhuo.

503
00:41:15,760 --> 00:41:17,560
Fortunately, I didn't drink it.

504
00:41:38,020 --> 00:41:38,830
Jiu.

505
00:41:39,350 --> 00:41:40,150
Come here.

506
00:41:48,470 --> 00:41:49,290
Jiu.

507
00:41:50,440 --> 00:41:52,840
Are you sure you want to go to Kunlun with us?

508
00:41:53,150 --> 00:41:53,750
Yes.

509
00:41:54,830 --> 00:41:55,550
No one knows

510
00:41:55,550 --> 00:41:57,310
what will happen on this trip.

511
00:41:57,420 --> 00:41:59,990
There will be many demons along the way.

512
00:42:00,870 --> 00:42:01,930
Aren't you afraid?

513
00:42:12,170 --> 00:42:12,960
Jiu.

514
00:42:17,190 --> 00:42:19,110
With this, I'm not afraid.

515
00:42:22,090 --> 00:42:24,290
Why do you like holding my bells so much?

516
00:42:25,480 --> 00:42:26,990
I'm too timid.

517
00:42:27,690 --> 00:42:28,510
But

518
00:42:28,530 --> 00:42:31,110
whenever I hear the bells on your braids ringing,

519
00:42:31,110 --> 00:42:32,190
I know

520
00:42:32,380 --> 00:42:34,180
you're by my side, Brother Zhuo,

521
00:42:34,710 --> 00:42:36,650
and I feel safe.

522
00:42:36,670 --> 00:42:38,930
Even if there are demons, I'm not afraid.

523
00:42:42,970 --> 00:42:44,370
So, Mr. Zhuo,

524
00:42:44,910 --> 00:42:45,870
why do you always

525
00:42:45,870 --> 00:42:47,750
put bells on your braids?

526
00:42:56,460 --> 00:42:57,490
When I was a kid,

527
00:42:58,850 --> 00:43:02,380
my older brother used to practice swordsmanship in the garden.

528
00:43:05,220 --> 00:43:09,120
♫Footsteps echo, one by one♫

529
00:43:05,820 --> 00:43:07,510
He was afraid I'd get lost,

530
00:43:07,770 --> 00:43:09,600
so he tied many bells

531
00:43:09,630 --> 00:43:12,580
♫Sorrows scattered, lost to the wind♫

532
00:43:09,670 --> 00:43:11,560
on my braids.

533
00:43:13,750 --> 00:43:17,620
♫Not forgetting, nor dwelling on♫

534
00:43:14,160 --> 00:43:17,180
As long as he heard the sound of the bells,

535
00:43:17,850 --> 00:43:20,810
♫The way back home♫

536
00:43:18,270 --> 00:43:19,430
he would know

537
00:43:19,450 --> 00:43:20,730
I didn't go far.

538
00:43:21,530 --> 00:43:23,140
♫With strong will♫

539
00:43:23,520 --> 00:43:27,100
♫I slowly carve out♫

540
00:43:27,660 --> 00:43:29,440
♫Growth♫

541
00:43:30,010 --> 00:43:31,650
♫Turning back♫

542
00:43:32,050 --> 00:43:35,430
♫I find you still in that familiar place♫

543
00:43:36,160 --> 00:43:38,030
♫Waiting there♫

544
00:43:36,270 --> 00:43:37,910
So when I first met you,

545
00:43:38,490 --> 00:43:39,900
I saw the dangling bell

546
00:43:39,930 --> 00:43:41,750
in your hair,

547
00:43:42,360 --> 00:43:43,990
and it reminded me of myself.

548
00:43:45,480 --> 00:43:48,430
My bells were put on by my brother

549
00:43:49,370 --> 00:43:51,630
because he was worried that I'd get lost.

550
00:43:52,110 --> 00:43:53,270
What about yours?

551
00:43:55,700 --> 00:43:57,080
I put it on because I was worried

552
00:43:57,080 --> 00:43:58,410
no one would look for me,

553
00:43:59,530 --> 00:44:00,860
and no one would find me.

554
00:44:04,380 --> 00:44:05,770
When I was little,

555
00:44:06,380 --> 00:44:08,840
I used to play hide-and-seek with my mother.

556
00:44:08,940 --> 00:44:11,470
I was worried that my mother couldn't find me,

557
00:44:13,840 --> 00:44:16,390
so I tied a bell on my braid.

558
00:44:16,420 --> 00:44:19,220
This way, my mother would always be able to find me.

559
00:44:21,950 --> 00:44:23,150
But soon afterwards,

560
00:44:25,040 --> 00:44:27,640
no one played hide-and-seek with me anymore.
