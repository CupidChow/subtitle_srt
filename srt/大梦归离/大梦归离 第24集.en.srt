[Episode 24]

3
00:02:34,980 --> 00:02:36,760
Wen Zongyu, I'll kill you!

4
00:02:39,829 --> 00:02:40,750
If you kill me,

5
00:02:40,750 --> 00:02:41,750
you'll die too.

6
00:02:43,340 --> 00:02:44,780
What do you mean?

7
00:02:46,570 --> 00:02:47,950
Have you never felt

8
00:02:47,950 --> 00:02:50,310
the burning pain in your chest?

9
00:03:04,930 --> 00:03:06,490
What did you do to me?

10
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:10,580
Whether it's used against a human or a demon,

11
00:03:11,220 --> 00:03:13,680
poison is always the most effective weapon.

12
00:03:14,150 --> 00:03:15,740
If you want to live,

13
00:03:16,329 --> 00:03:18,160
you have to listen to me.

14
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:20,560
I, Li Lun,

15
00:03:22,100 --> 00:03:23,990
never take orders from anyone!

16
00:03:24,750 --> 00:03:25,590
Really?

17
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:57,680
Imperial Physician Liu has checked on him.

18
00:03:58,079 --> 00:04:01,100
He said Zhuo has serious internal injuries

19
00:04:01,230 --> 00:04:02,630
and his life is in danger.

20
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:05,360
He couldn't find the cause

21
00:04:05,830 --> 00:04:08,230
and can only keep him alive with medication

22
00:04:08,350 --> 00:04:10,000
and daily acupuncture.

23
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:13,540
Bingyi has many descendants,

24
00:04:14,190 --> 00:04:17,450
but only a few can be acknowledged by the Cloud Light Sword.

25
00:04:17,529 --> 00:04:19,730
Those who are acknowledged by the Sword

26
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:21,540
will empathize with it.

27
00:04:24,060 --> 00:04:25,350
The Cloud Light Sword

28
00:04:25,930 --> 00:04:27,930
will then become his fate weapon.

29
00:04:29,850 --> 00:04:31,210
Fate weapon?

30
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:35,470
Having a fate weapon means that

31
00:04:36,420 --> 00:04:38,080
as long as the sword is intact,

32
00:04:38,390 --> 00:04:39,650
its owner stays alive;

33
00:04:40,620 --> 00:04:42,080
if the sword is destroyed,

34
00:04:42,440 --> 00:04:43,300
its owner dies.

35
00:04:45,850 --> 00:04:46,550
So,

36
00:04:47,230 --> 00:04:49,050
that's the reason

37
00:04:49,710 --> 00:04:51,190
why Zhuo is in a coma.

38
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:57,250
I lost control of my malicious energy…

39
00:05:01,640 --> 00:05:04,050
and caused the Cloud Light Sword to crack.

40
00:05:06,350 --> 00:05:08,560
Otherwise, Li Lun alone…

41
00:05:11,590 --> 00:05:14,650
wasn't powerful enough to break the Cloud Light Sword.

42
00:05:17,310 --> 00:05:19,720
Zhuo tried his best to save me,

43
00:05:20,940 --> 00:05:21,780
but I…

44
00:05:24,550 --> 00:05:25,640
hurt him.

45
00:06:00,710 --> 00:06:02,150
If Jiu were here…

46
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:06,420
he'd definitely have a solution.

47
00:06:07,790 --> 00:06:08,810
Yes.

48
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:12,650
Jiu is the most famous young physician in Tiandu.

49
00:06:13,430 --> 00:06:14,910
He cured a lot of people.

50
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:19,750
Ms. Pei.

51
00:06:20,830 --> 00:06:21,740
Do you think

52
00:06:22,270 --> 00:06:23,240
Jiu will

53
00:06:23,910 --> 00:06:25,830
return to the way he used to be?

54
00:06:31,010 --> 00:06:33,070
I'll definitely take him back

55
00:06:34,670 --> 00:06:36,190
from Li Lun.

56
00:06:55,150 --> 00:06:55,870
Ah.

57
00:06:57,230 --> 00:06:57,870
How about

58
00:06:58,320 --> 00:07:00,050
we ask Mr. Lu Wu about it?

59
00:07:00,350 --> 00:07:02,820
There are many rare herbs on Mount Kunlun.

60
00:07:03,190 --> 00:07:03,910
Maybe

61
00:07:03,910 --> 00:07:05,110
Mr. Lu Wu has a way

62
00:07:05,110 --> 00:07:06,530
to cure Mr. Zhuo

63
00:07:06,710 --> 00:07:08,400
or wake Bai Jiu up.

64
00:07:11,860 --> 00:07:13,120
Are you coming with me?

65
00:07:16,660 --> 00:07:17,470
Yes.

66
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:29,060
Li Lun used his inner core

67
00:07:29,060 --> 00:07:30,890
to live in Bai Jiu.

68
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,060
It's much more powerful

69
00:07:32,060 --> 00:07:34,080
than possession by spells.

70
00:07:34,159 --> 00:07:35,820
It's hard to get rid of him.

71
00:07:36,390 --> 00:07:37,220
Is there

72
00:07:37,350 --> 00:07:39,020
no solution at all?

73
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:41,320
There is.

74
00:07:41,940 --> 00:07:44,010
You need the help of Bingyi's descendants.

75
00:07:44,010 --> 00:07:45,030
They can use the Cloud Light Sword

76
00:07:45,030 --> 00:07:48,360
to separate the parasitic primordial spirit from the host.

77
00:07:48,470 --> 00:07:49,530
Cloud Light Sword?

78
00:07:50,590 --> 00:07:51,390
Mr. Zhuo?

79
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:55,690
But I heard

80
00:07:55,990 --> 00:07:58,320
the Cloud Light Sword has been destroyed.

81
00:08:00,090 --> 00:08:00,890
Mr. Lu Wu,

82
00:08:01,870 --> 00:08:02,870
Mr. Zhuo

83
00:08:02,900 --> 00:08:03,990
is in a coma now.

84
00:08:04,650 --> 00:08:05,750
Is there any way

85
00:08:05,750 --> 00:08:06,900
to wake him up?

86
00:08:07,750 --> 00:08:09,170
There is Gui Wood in the Wilderness.

87
00:08:09,170 --> 00:08:10,870
Eating it can restore his energy

88
00:08:10,870 --> 00:08:13,480
and slow down his deterioration.

89
00:08:14,390 --> 00:08:15,230
Gui Wood?

90
00:08:16,950 --> 00:08:17,650
Okay.

91
00:08:18,030 --> 00:08:19,040
I got it.

92
00:08:20,590 --> 00:08:21,380
Ms. Pei.

93
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:24,200
I'll send you back first.

94
00:08:24,280 --> 00:08:25,290
I'll go with you.

95
00:08:25,320 --> 00:08:26,360
No.

96
00:08:26,750 --> 00:08:27,750
Gui Wood grows

97
00:08:27,750 --> 00:08:29,820
in the crevices of black rocks along the seaside in the Wilderness.

98
00:08:29,820 --> 00:08:31,370
Sea scorpions are everywhere.

99
00:08:31,370 --> 00:08:33,370
There are also red-bellied snakes.

100
00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:34,919
Since it's so dangerous,

101
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:37,320
I can't let you go alone.

102
00:08:37,950 --> 00:08:39,309
You're still injured.

103
00:08:39,669 --> 00:08:40,780
Let me go.

104
00:08:40,809 --> 00:08:42,350
You're not familiar with the Wilderness,

105
00:08:42,350 --> 00:08:43,640
and there are demons everywhere.

106
00:08:43,640 --> 00:08:44,520
I'll go.

107
00:08:44,790 --> 00:08:46,190
I'll bring Gui Wood back.

108
00:08:47,340 --> 00:08:48,280
Mr. Zhuo

109
00:08:48,350 --> 00:08:50,280
is the person Jiu admires the most.

110
00:08:50,950 --> 00:08:52,430
I must wake him up.

111
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:54,790
You should stay

112
00:08:55,110 --> 00:08:56,170
to accompany Xiao.

113
00:08:57,170 --> 00:08:58,970
Goddess needs you more than I do.

114
00:09:10,230 --> 00:09:10,930
Sir.

115
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:26,400
You're back.

116
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:28,400
How do you feel?

117
00:09:29,630 --> 00:09:30,960
Thank you

118
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:32,260
for your treatment.

119
00:09:33,310 --> 00:09:34,960
I'm right as rain now.

120
00:09:35,220 --> 00:09:36,940
Even better than I was

121
00:09:37,230 --> 00:09:38,230
before I got hurt.

122
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:45,190
Commander,

123
00:09:45,190 --> 00:09:46,190
according to the spy,

124
00:09:46,190 --> 00:09:49,520
Zhuo Yichen from the Demon Hunting Bureau is sick and dying.

125
00:09:51,860 --> 00:09:54,890
Only Zhuo Yichen can kill Zhao Yuanzhou.

126
00:09:55,430 --> 00:09:57,130
He can't die!

127
00:10:04,950 --> 00:10:06,030
What's wrong?

128
00:10:14,770 --> 00:10:16,440
Wen Zongyu's poison.

129
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:18,870
Poison?

130
00:10:19,940 --> 00:10:21,330
This can wait.

131
00:10:22,310 --> 00:10:25,310
The most important thing now is the Cloud Light Sword.

132
00:10:28,100 --> 00:10:30,040
It can remove my primordial spirit

133
00:10:30,990 --> 00:10:33,000
from Bai Jiu's body.

134
00:10:34,700 --> 00:10:36,780
It's the only thing

135
00:10:37,150 --> 00:10:39,150
I'm afraid of now.

136
00:10:39,950 --> 00:10:41,350
But the Cloud Light Sword

137
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:44,580
has been destroyed, hasn't it?

138
00:10:46,770 --> 00:10:49,030
If we can't repair the Cloud Light Sword,

139
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:52,470
Zhuo will keep deteriorating

140
00:10:53,580 --> 00:10:55,340
until he dies.

141
00:10:58,080 --> 00:11:00,280
How can we repair the Cloud Light Sword?

142
00:11:02,670 --> 00:11:05,000
The Cloud Light Sword could be destroyed,

143
00:11:05,850 --> 00:11:07,320
so it can be repaired.

144
00:11:10,950 --> 00:11:12,240
I'll go stop them.

145
00:11:12,870 --> 00:11:13,670
No need.

146
00:11:16,710 --> 00:11:18,410
I have a better plan.

147
00:11:34,270 --> 00:11:34,800
Brother.

148
00:11:35,070 --> 00:11:36,200
You're amazing.

149
00:11:36,370 --> 00:11:37,820
The sword technique just now

150
00:11:37,820 --> 00:11:38,920
looked so cool.

151
00:11:47,330 --> 00:11:48,450
Unfortunately,

152
00:11:49,630 --> 00:11:51,530
the Cloud Light Sword

153
00:11:51,880 --> 00:11:54,260
is only a normal sword in my hand.

154
00:11:56,060 --> 00:11:57,460
I can't wake it up.

155
00:11:59,260 --> 00:12:00,070
Wake it up?

156
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:03,260
This sword can be awakened?

157
00:12:03,930 --> 00:12:05,760
Once awakened, the Cloud Light Sword

158
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:07,270
can shake the sun and moon

159
00:12:07,290 --> 00:12:08,860
and make the earth tremble.

160
00:12:09,270 --> 00:12:11,890
As long as the one using it is strong enough,

161
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,460
the Cloud Light Sword will awaken on itself.

162
00:12:24,870 --> 00:12:27,930
Brother, you're so powerful but still can't wake it up.

163
00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:30,830
I'm definitely hopeless.

164
00:12:42,010 --> 00:12:44,230
Yichen, have faith in yourself.

165
00:12:45,290 --> 00:12:46,640
After you grow up,

166
00:12:47,330 --> 00:12:49,790
you'll absolutely be more powerful than me.

167
00:12:53,070 --> 00:12:55,330
Then I'll try my best to catch up with you.

168
00:12:55,480 --> 00:12:56,280
Okay.

169
00:13:00,670 --> 00:13:01,920
But later,

170
00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:03,900
I'll go out with Father

171
00:13:04,420 --> 00:13:06,060
to catch a great demon.

172
00:13:07,350 --> 00:13:08,520
When I come back,

173
00:13:08,540 --> 00:13:10,660
I'll teach you the technique just now,

174
00:13:10,660 --> 00:13:11,510
okay?

175
00:13:12,790 --> 00:13:13,750
Deal!

176
00:14:26,990 --> 00:14:28,120
Where is my brother?

177
00:14:32,770 --> 00:14:33,960
Say something.

178
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:38,490
Where is my brother?

179
00:15:27,590 --> 00:15:28,380
Brother.

180
00:15:30,390 --> 00:15:33,720
You promised to come back and teach me that sword technique.

181
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:37,030
We made a deal.

182
00:15:48,120 --> 00:15:49,990
♫Someone is singing♫

183
00:15:50,070 --> 00:15:52,270
♫Can you hear it?♫

184
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:55,970
♫The burning hoarseness♫

185
00:15:54,910 --> 00:15:55,720
Brother,

186
00:15:56,210 --> 00:15:58,580
I swear to be acknowledged by the Cloud Light Sword

187
00:15:56,270 --> 00:15:58,150
♫It sprouts♫

188
00:15:58,190 --> 00:16:00,090
♫And then blooms♫

189
00:15:59,210 --> 00:15:59,850
and learn

190
00:15:59,870 --> 00:16:01,970
the technique you didn't get to teach me.

191
00:16:00,530 --> 00:16:03,650
♫The time of loneliness♫

192
00:16:03,570 --> 00:16:05,480
I'll avenge you and Father.

193
00:16:04,770 --> 00:16:06,680
♫Someone is singing♫

194
00:16:06,750 --> 00:16:08,590
♫I hold the light♫

♫Going the direction where you are♫

♫The bell rings unemotionally♫

197
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:20,620

00:16:30,440 --> 00:16:31,240
Brother.

203
00:16:31,880 --> 00:16:33,610
♫Drifting♫

204
00:16:32,470 --> 00:16:34,150

♫Swaying♫

♫Someday I'll return to my old hometown♫

209
00:17:45,710 --> 00:17:51,780
♫Wearing old clothes but with eyes shining bright♫

210
00:17:52,600 --> 00:17:54,720

♫Blocking the pain♫

216
00:18:18,110 --> 00:18:19,210
Cloud Light Sword.

217
00:18:23,030 --> 00:18:24,420
Cloud Light Sword.

218
00:18:25,090 --> 00:18:25,900
Zhuo.

219
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,070
Zhuo.

220
00:18:33,010 --> 00:18:34,170
Cloud Light Sword.

221
00:18:34,830 --> 00:18:35,890
Cloud Light Sword.

222
00:18:36,800 --> 00:18:37,860
Cloud Light Sword.

223
00:18:40,120 --> 00:18:41,110
Cloud Light Sword!

224
00:18:41,110 --> 00:18:42,110
Zhuo.

225
00:18:51,270 --> 00:18:52,160
Zhuo.

226
00:18:54,270 --> 00:18:55,400
Zhuo!

227
00:18:55,900 --> 00:18:56,890
Zhuo!

228
00:19:55,280 --> 00:19:56,110
What's this?

229
00:19:56,500 --> 00:20:00,950
It's the Bingyi Clan's secret heirloom that has been passed down through generations.

230
00:20:00,950 --> 00:20:02,350
The Fire-Colored Stone.

231
00:20:03,710 --> 00:20:05,920
The kind of stone that Nuwa used

232
00:20:06,980 --> 00:20:08,380
to mend the sky back then?

233
00:20:09,040 --> 00:20:10,180
Yes.

234
00:20:11,470 --> 00:20:12,430
But why is it

235
00:20:12,430 --> 00:20:14,890
in the pool of the Demon Hunting Bureau?

236
00:20:14,910 --> 00:20:17,510
This mansion used to belong to the Zhuo family.

237
00:20:17,670 --> 00:20:20,790
The Zhuo family has kept the Five-Colored Stone for generations.

238
00:20:20,790 --> 00:20:22,580
It can mend the sky

239
00:20:23,150 --> 00:20:24,830
and repair everything.

240
00:20:25,430 --> 00:20:26,710
So I guess

241
00:20:28,700 --> 00:20:32,030
the Five-Colored Stone sensed the broken Cloud Light Sword

242
00:20:32,990 --> 00:20:34,710
and showed up itself.

243
00:20:35,290 --> 00:20:35,910
Great!

244
00:20:35,910 --> 00:20:36,470
But…

245
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:39,640
I found a way to save Zhuo.

246
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:15,330
Jiu?

247
00:21:20,420 --> 00:21:21,230
Li Lun.

248
00:21:22,990 --> 00:21:25,250
Do you have to destroy every hope we have?

249
00:21:25,790 --> 00:21:27,700
Can't you spare Zhuo's life?

250
00:21:28,110 --> 00:21:29,330
What about me?

251
00:21:31,740 --> 00:21:34,170
Who will spare my life?

252
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:38,160
Both Zhuo Yichen and Bai Jiu are my friends.

253
00:21:40,830 --> 00:21:42,290
I must save them.

254
00:21:44,050 --> 00:21:46,580
I used to be your friend too.

255
00:21:46,610 --> 00:21:48,210
I didn't want this to happen.

256
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:51,000
You brought it on yourself.

257
00:21:53,990 --> 00:21:55,280
You didn't want to,

258
00:21:57,460 --> 00:21:59,520
but you still did it.

259
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:02,180
You started all this.

260
00:22:03,480 --> 00:22:04,990
You took over Jiu's body

261
00:22:05,050 --> 00:22:06,680
and live in it.

262
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:10,340
I won't just sit back and watch.

263
00:22:11,450 --> 00:22:12,240
Oh?

264
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:14,600
Really?

265
00:22:19,330 --> 00:22:21,460
Then I'll wait for you to come after me.

266
00:22:55,430 --> 00:22:56,970
Fortunately, the Five-Colored Stone

267
00:22:56,970 --> 00:22:58,630
wasn't taken away by Li Lun.

268
00:23:19,020 --> 00:23:20,700
It's Li Lun's vine.

269
00:23:24,560 --> 00:23:28,220
The Stone has been corroded by the demonic energy of Li Lun's vine.

270
00:23:56,950 --> 00:23:57,750
Zhuo!

271
00:24:01,350 --> 00:24:02,270
Zhuo!

272
00:24:11,080 --> 00:24:12,590
For the greater good,

273
00:24:12,850 --> 00:24:14,620
I don't mind dying.

274
00:24:14,910 --> 00:24:15,870
Ying Long,

275
00:24:16,300 --> 00:24:17,650
you don't mind dying,

276
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:20,660
but have you ever thought about my feelings?

277
00:24:23,510 --> 00:24:24,310
Bingyi?

278
00:24:45,320 --> 00:24:46,730
Bingyi.

279
00:24:56,270 --> 00:24:57,070
I see.

280
00:24:59,120 --> 00:25:02,310
Li Lun didn't come for the Five-Colored Stone.

281
00:25:02,550 --> 00:25:03,810
Then what does he want?

282
00:25:06,100 --> 00:25:07,640
He wants to turn Zhuo

283
00:25:10,870 --> 00:25:12,000
into a demon.

284
00:25:20,010 --> 00:25:20,870
Gui Wood!

285
00:25:20,900 --> 00:25:22,430
I've brought Gui Wood back.

286
00:25:32,770 --> 00:25:33,630
Mr. Zhuo.

287
00:25:34,410 --> 00:25:35,490
What's going on?

288
00:25:54,830 --> 00:25:56,680
Mr. Zhuo has taken Gui Wood.

289
00:25:57,220 --> 00:25:58,370
Mr. Lu Wu said

290
00:25:58,820 --> 00:26:01,240
Gui Wood can keep Mr. Zhuo alive for now

291
00:26:01,330 --> 00:26:02,530
and buy him some time.

292
00:26:15,720 --> 00:26:17,320
Why are you so badly injured?

293
00:26:18,910 --> 00:26:20,230
It's not serious.

294
00:26:22,190 --> 00:26:22,990
Does it hurt?

295
00:26:23,620 --> 00:26:25,250
Just some scratches.

296
00:26:25,810 --> 00:26:26,770
But

297
00:26:27,180 --> 00:26:28,320
they really hurt.

298
00:26:28,350 --> 00:26:29,460
I'll go with you.

299
00:26:29,480 --> 00:26:30,360
No, no, no.

300
00:26:30,870 --> 00:26:32,630
Gui Wood grows in the crevices of black rocks

301
00:26:32,630 --> 00:26:33,840
along the seaside in the Wilderness.

302
00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:35,510
Sea scorpions are everywhere.

303
00:26:35,510 --> 00:26:36,620
There are also red-bellied snakes.

304
00:26:36,620 --> 00:26:37,830
Since it's so dangerous

305
00:26:37,830 --> 00:26:39,060
and you're still injured,

306
00:26:39,060 --> 00:26:39,980
let me go.

307
00:26:40,010 --> 00:26:41,510
You're not familiar with the Wilderness.

308
00:26:41,510 --> 00:26:42,540
I'll go.

309
00:26:43,160 --> 00:26:44,820
I'll definitely get Gui Wood.

310
00:26:57,160 --> 00:26:59,210
But as long as it can save Mr. Zhuo,

311
00:26:59,720 --> 00:27:00,720
it's all worth it.

312
00:27:04,070 --> 00:27:05,200
It's useless.

313
00:27:06,190 --> 00:27:07,770
You brought Gui Wood back,

314
00:27:08,520 --> 00:27:10,250
but it's just a band-aid fix.

315
00:27:15,290 --> 00:27:17,150
Don't be so cruel, Zhao Yuanzhou.

316
00:27:17,700 --> 00:27:19,830
It was hard for Ying Lei to get Gui Wood.

317
00:27:22,730 --> 00:27:24,940
I just don't want you to be hopeful

318
00:27:25,430 --> 00:27:27,230
and then greatly disappointed.

319
00:27:27,610 --> 00:27:29,260
Prepare for the worst.

320
00:27:29,280 --> 00:27:31,280
What is the worst that could happen?

321
00:27:45,660 --> 00:27:47,520
Breaking the Five-Colored Stone

322
00:27:48,230 --> 00:27:51,140
was worse than breaking the Cloud Light Sword.

323
00:27:52,340 --> 00:27:53,830
The Five-Colored Stone was a sacred object of the Bingyi Clan

324
00:27:53,830 --> 00:27:56,090
that had been passed down from generation to generation.

325
00:27:56,090 --> 00:27:59,020
Besides the ability to repair the Cloud Light Sword,

326
00:27:59,020 --> 00:28:00,970
it was also a very important…

327
00:28:02,670 --> 00:28:03,710
vessel.

328
00:28:04,270 --> 00:28:05,210
Vessel?

329
00:28:06,300 --> 00:28:07,790
To be precise,

330
00:28:09,190 --> 00:28:11,550
it was a vessel for suppression.

331
00:28:15,920 --> 00:28:17,450
You mean that drop of blood?

332
00:28:19,210 --> 00:28:20,660
It was demon blood.

333
00:28:24,350 --> 00:28:25,420
Demon blood?

334
00:28:28,420 --> 00:28:30,890
Back then, Zhuan Xu and Gong Gong started a great war.

335
00:28:30,890 --> 00:28:33,260
Ying Long and Bingyi were involved in it

336
00:28:33,990 --> 00:28:35,340
and fought together.

337
00:28:36,220 --> 00:28:37,760
But legend has it that

338
00:28:38,710 --> 00:28:40,370
Bingyi killed Ying Long

339
00:28:40,760 --> 00:28:42,580
and used his bone

340
00:28:42,750 --> 00:28:44,130
and soul

341
00:28:44,490 --> 00:28:46,640
to forge the Cloud Light Sword.

342
00:28:47,060 --> 00:28:49,260
If they once fought together,

343
00:28:49,550 --> 00:28:50,740
why did

344
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:52,800
Bingyi kill Ying Long?

345
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:53,990
It's said that

346
00:28:54,020 --> 00:28:56,180
after Gong Gong crashed Mount Buzhou,

347
00:28:56,360 --> 00:28:58,690
the world was thrown into chaos.

348
00:28:59,040 --> 00:29:01,200
But Ying Long kept causing havoc

349
00:29:01,340 --> 00:29:02,620
to destroy the world.

350
00:29:02,660 --> 00:29:05,520
He even attempted to stop Nuwa from mending the sky.

351
00:29:06,080 --> 00:29:08,600
Fortunately, Bingyi came to his senses in time.

352
00:29:08,600 --> 00:29:09,930
He realized his mistake

353
00:29:10,750 --> 00:29:12,030
and killed Ying Long.

354
00:29:13,920 --> 00:29:15,300
In that case…

355
00:29:18,430 --> 00:29:20,040
Bingyi was also a demon?

356
00:29:22,550 --> 00:29:23,340
Yes.

357
00:29:24,300 --> 00:29:25,760
Bingyi killed

358
00:29:26,110 --> 00:29:28,460
many evil demons in his time,

359
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:31,120
so people have always seen him as a god.

360
00:29:31,700 --> 00:29:32,930
But in fact,

361
00:29:34,220 --> 00:29:36,900
he was a great demon born in the Wilderness.

362
00:29:39,800 --> 00:29:40,610
Stop!

363
00:29:46,510 --> 00:29:47,950
You want to catch me?

364
00:29:47,980 --> 00:29:49,580
Demons are evil.

365
00:29:49,710 --> 00:29:51,080
Of course I have to catch you.

366
00:29:51,080 --> 00:29:53,590
But your ancestor was also a demon.

367
00:29:54,380 --> 00:29:56,180
Are you sure you want to catch me?

368
00:30:00,610 --> 00:30:02,640
Why are these stairs so...

369
00:30:07,280 --> 00:30:08,350
Where is Ao Ying?

370
00:30:10,120 --> 00:30:11,390
She escaped.

371
00:30:15,130 --> 00:30:16,080
So...

372
00:30:18,010 --> 00:30:19,120
Zhuo

373
00:30:20,870 --> 00:30:21,870
is also a demon?

374
00:30:23,400 --> 00:30:24,380
Zhuo

375
00:30:24,810 --> 00:30:25,780
is a human.

376
00:30:29,550 --> 00:30:31,270
You're confusing me.

377
00:30:33,470 --> 00:30:35,330
After the battle at Mount Buzhou,

378
00:30:36,470 --> 00:30:38,670
Bingyi wanted to live a reclusive life.

379
00:30:38,970 --> 00:30:41,740
Touched by his heroic deed of killing Ying Long,

380
00:30:42,580 --> 00:30:43,630
Nuwa gifted him

381
00:30:43,630 --> 00:30:45,630
the last Five-Colored Stone

382
00:30:46,330 --> 00:30:47,790
left from mending the sky.

383
00:30:48,340 --> 00:30:50,220
And as Bingyi wished,

384
00:30:50,330 --> 00:30:52,070
she removed his inner core

385
00:30:52,860 --> 00:30:54,530
and purified his demonic energy,

386
00:30:54,530 --> 00:30:56,060
changing him into a mortal.

387
00:30:56,530 --> 00:30:58,950
Since then, Bingyi had lived in the mortal world

388
00:30:58,950 --> 00:31:00,290
in seclusion.

389
00:31:02,630 --> 00:31:04,420
So his descendants

390
00:31:05,560 --> 00:31:07,170
are not demons

391
00:31:08,050 --> 00:31:09,140
but humans.

392
00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:18,950
So the blood in the Five-Colored Stone

393
00:31:19,020 --> 00:31:20,610
was from Bingyi?

394
00:31:20,760 --> 00:31:22,370
Although Nuwa respected

395
00:31:22,390 --> 00:31:24,450
Bingyi's wish to become a mortal,

396
00:31:25,260 --> 00:31:26,590
she couldn't bear to see

397
00:31:26,800 --> 00:31:29,240
Bingyi's rare great power

398
00:31:29,390 --> 00:31:31,340
disappear from the world.

399
00:31:31,490 --> 00:31:33,030
So she sealed a drop of Bingyi's blood

400
00:31:33,030 --> 00:31:35,110
in the Five-Colored Stone

401
00:31:35,130 --> 00:31:36,530
and let it be passed down.

402
00:31:37,630 --> 00:31:38,920
That drop of blood

403
00:31:39,270 --> 00:31:40,760
was the last thing from Bingyi

404
00:31:40,760 --> 00:31:42,310
in this world.

405
00:31:44,830 --> 00:31:46,950
For Bingyi's descendants,

406
00:31:47,920 --> 00:31:50,540
it's sort of a way of undoing that decision.

407
00:31:51,510 --> 00:31:53,230
It allows them

408
00:31:53,510 --> 00:31:55,440
to choose their identities again.

409
00:31:58,730 --> 00:31:59,620
So…

410
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:04,300
Zhuo will become a demon too,

411
00:32:04,750 --> 00:32:05,710
right?

412
00:32:07,370 --> 00:32:09,120
Once the ink drops into the water,

413
00:32:09,120 --> 00:32:11,050
it's impossible to separate them.

414
00:32:11,520 --> 00:32:13,320
Once he starts becoming a demon,

415
00:32:15,280 --> 00:32:17,010
the process can't be reversed.

416
00:32:19,290 --> 00:32:20,060
No.

417
00:32:20,630 --> 00:32:21,650
No, no, no.

418
00:32:22,110 --> 00:32:24,110
You're probably thinking too much.

419
00:32:24,450 --> 00:32:26,300
Mr. Zhuo is a mortal.

420
00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:27,980
He doesn't have an inner core.

421
00:32:27,990 --> 00:32:29,490
Even if he has demonic power,

422
00:32:29,490 --> 00:32:30,950
it can't change anything.

423
00:32:31,570 --> 00:32:32,900
He can't become a demon.

424
00:32:33,790 --> 00:32:34,910
You're right.

425
00:32:35,970 --> 00:32:37,770
That's the worst-case scenario

426
00:32:38,090 --> 00:32:39,410
I mentioned.

427
00:32:40,810 --> 00:32:42,810
A mortal without an inner core

428
00:32:44,510 --> 00:32:46,740
can't absorb and carry demonic power.

429
00:32:47,230 --> 00:32:49,500
Once Bingyi's immense demonic power awakens,

430
00:32:49,500 --> 00:32:51,380
it'll rage through

431
00:32:51,410 --> 00:32:52,980
Zhuo's body

432
00:32:53,850 --> 00:32:55,490
until his veins burst.

433
00:32:56,230 --> 00:32:57,470
All his organs

434
00:32:58,170 --> 00:32:59,790
will be torn apart.

435
00:33:00,420 --> 00:33:03,080
When the demon blood completely takes control,

436
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:06,630
he'll die.

437
00:33:13,330 --> 00:33:15,070
Is there no way to save him?

438
00:33:16,330 --> 00:33:17,610
As far as I know,

439
00:33:19,410 --> 00:33:20,390
no.

440
00:33:23,220 --> 00:33:24,180
Unless...

441
00:33:24,210 --> 00:33:25,330
What?

442
00:33:27,210 --> 00:33:30,140
Unless we go to the forbidden area of the Bingyi Clan.

443
00:33:30,670 --> 00:33:31,780
There,

444
00:33:32,570 --> 00:33:35,240
we might find a way to save Zhuo.

445
00:33:42,120 --> 00:33:42,990
Ms. Pei,

446
00:33:43,310 --> 00:33:45,970
are we really going to the sacred site of the Bingyi Clan?

447
00:33:45,970 --> 00:33:47,430
The old Mountain Gods said

448
00:33:47,650 --> 00:33:48,940
that's a scary place.

449
00:33:50,310 --> 00:33:51,100
Stop there!

450
00:33:56,500 --> 00:33:57,400
It's you.

451
00:33:58,550 --> 00:34:00,220
I'm here to check on

452
00:34:00,380 --> 00:34:02,350
Commander Zhuo's injuries.

453
00:34:03,930 --> 00:34:06,460
You're like a weasel pretending to be caring.

454
00:34:09,730 --> 00:34:11,880
Or a tiger pretending to be softhearted.

455
00:34:11,880 --> 00:34:13,280
You're like a cockroach…

456
00:34:15,310 --> 00:34:17,310
Everyone knows you're up to no good.

457
00:34:17,670 --> 00:34:19,219
I do care for him.

458
00:34:21,080 --> 00:34:22,940
I'm worried that Mr. Zhuo may die.

459
00:34:23,350 --> 00:34:25,929
Your meridians were crushed by Zhao Yuanzhou's violent demonic power,

460
00:34:25,929 --> 00:34:26,929
but you survived.

461
00:34:27,190 --> 00:34:29,340
How could anything happen to Mr. Zhuo?

462
00:34:29,590 --> 00:34:31,389
Born into a rich family, Mr. Zhuo

463
00:34:31,719 --> 00:34:33,600
is fragile.

464
00:34:33,830 --> 00:34:35,870
You must take good care of him.

465
00:34:38,310 --> 00:34:39,440
Did I hear him right?

466
00:34:40,620 --> 00:34:41,840
He asked us

467
00:34:42,310 --> 00:34:44,230
to take good care of Mr. Zhuo?

468
00:34:44,750 --> 00:34:45,360
Yes.

469
00:34:48,350 --> 00:34:49,580
Could it be that…

470
00:34:50,190 --> 00:34:50,909
he suddenly cares?

471
00:34:50,909 --> 00:34:52,370
it's Wen Zongyu's scheme?

472
00:34:55,650 --> 00:34:56,440
Ms. Pei.

473
00:34:56,659 --> 00:34:57,590
Shall I stop him?

474
00:34:58,630 --> 00:34:59,230
Yes.

475
00:35:16,750 --> 00:35:17,950
Are you hiding there?

476
00:35:31,100 --> 00:35:32,310
What exactly is

477
00:35:33,510 --> 00:35:35,440
the Bingyi Clan's forbidden area?

478
00:35:37,670 --> 00:35:39,800
It's the Bingyi Clan's burial ground.

479
00:35:41,260 --> 00:35:43,280
All their past stories and secrets

480
00:35:43,310 --> 00:35:45,110
are buried there.

481
00:35:46,390 --> 00:35:47,300
At that place,

482
00:35:48,200 --> 00:35:50,620
we might find a way to save Zhuo.

483
00:35:50,830 --> 00:35:53,060
Do you know where that area is?

484
00:35:53,790 --> 00:35:54,590
Of course.

485
00:35:56,950 --> 00:35:58,130
In the Wilderness…

486
00:36:00,210 --> 00:36:02,210
that place is famous.

487
00:36:03,670 --> 00:36:04,910
Then let's go there.

488
00:36:55,040 --> 00:36:59,970

As the old saying goes,

502
00:37:45,340 --> 00:37:46,690
aunts and nephews

503
00:37:46,710 --> 00:37:47,980
are so close

504
00:37:48,180 --> 00:37:49,370
that even if the bones break,

505
00:37:49,370 --> 00:37:50,770
the connection remains.

506
00:37:50,860 --> 00:37:52,870
I didn't expect you

507
00:37:53,450 --> 00:37:55,510
to care so much about Zhuo as his aunt.

508
00:38:00,950 --> 00:38:02,270
I always

509
00:38:02,270 --> 00:38:04,510
tease him by saying I'm his aunt,

510
00:38:06,040 --> 00:38:07,590
but actually,

511
00:38:08,260 --> 00:38:09,700
since I was young,

512
00:38:11,500 --> 00:38:13,600
he has been taking care of me.

513
00:38:15,080 --> 00:38:16,710
Once,

514
00:38:16,970 --> 00:38:18,600
I caught a cold.

515
00:38:20,250 --> 00:38:23,180
My father happened to be away for official business.

516
00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:24,680
So Zhuo

517
00:38:25,600 --> 00:38:27,080
got a doctor for me,

518
00:38:28,480 --> 00:38:29,740
prepared decoctions,

519
00:38:30,340 --> 00:38:31,940
and took care of me all night.

520
00:38:33,360 --> 00:38:34,870
After I recovered,

521
00:38:36,010 --> 00:38:37,930
he fell ill.

522
00:38:38,340 --> 00:38:39,580
I felt very guilty.

523
00:38:41,400 --> 00:38:43,210
But he actually told me that

524
00:38:44,440 --> 00:38:46,100
he was happy

525
00:38:47,160 --> 00:38:49,700
because after I gave him my cold,

526
00:38:50,030 --> 00:38:51,310
I could recover.

527
00:38:54,670 --> 00:38:56,110
He was such a fool,

528
00:38:56,880 --> 00:38:57,890
wasn't he?

529
00:38:59,840 --> 00:39:01,780
The 15-year-old Mr. Zhuo

530
00:39:04,150 --> 00:39:05,560
was still so childish.

531
00:39:06,420 --> 00:39:07,710
He was childish,

532
00:39:10,190 --> 00:39:11,730
but he was also sensible

533
00:39:12,560 --> 00:39:13,830
and strong.

534
00:39:15,590 --> 00:39:18,520
In the year after his father and brother passed away,

535
00:39:19,080 --> 00:39:20,910
he was depressed.

536
00:39:22,240 --> 00:39:23,640
But soon,

537
00:39:24,150 --> 00:39:26,030
he pulled himself together

538
00:39:26,500 --> 00:39:28,280
and became strong, brave,

539
00:39:28,430 --> 00:39:29,710
and independent.

540
00:39:30,430 --> 00:39:31,790
He became the talented swordsman

541
00:39:31,790 --> 00:39:34,310
whom everyone in Tiandu looked up to.

542
00:39:35,120 --> 00:39:36,110
Sometimes,

543
00:39:38,200 --> 00:39:39,880
people become independent

544
00:39:42,380 --> 00:39:44,410
not because they're sensible,

545
00:39:46,860 --> 00:39:48,060
but because…

546
00:39:52,510 --> 00:39:53,510
Because what?

547
00:39:57,970 --> 00:39:59,750
Because they're lonely.

548
00:40:08,500 --> 00:40:09,550
Are you scared?

549
00:40:13,690 --> 00:40:14,910
Don't be scared.

550
00:40:16,220 --> 00:40:17,780
Zhuo

551
00:40:18,750 --> 00:40:20,230
is no longer

552
00:40:20,770 --> 00:40:21,990
the boy he used to be.

553
00:40:24,420 --> 00:40:25,650
He has us.

554
00:40:28,610 --> 00:40:29,220
Yes.

555
00:40:31,700 --> 00:40:33,050
He's not lonely.

556
00:40:31,980 --> 00:40:38,850
♫There are countless rules in this world♫

557
00:40:33,100 --> 00:40:34,600
You're not the only one

558
00:40:34,860 --> 00:40:36,390
in the Demon Hunting Squad.

559
00:40:36,410 --> 00:40:38,010
You don't have to take everything on your shoulders.

560
00:40:38,010 --> 00:40:39,300
Let me do it.

561
00:40:39,390 --> 00:40:43,410
♫But none can compare to "I am willing"♫

562
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:43,960
I'll go to the Wilderness to find Gui Wood for Mr. Zhuo.

563
00:40:44,220 --> 00:40:53,630
♫If heaven decides my destiny, I'll be its enemy♫

564
00:40:48,240 --> 00:40:49,390
Mr. Zhuo.

565
00:40:49,830 --> 00:40:52,290
I'll definitely bring Gui Wood back for you.

566
00:40:56,100 --> 00:41:02,890
♫I sing under the moon and swing my sword to the wind♫

567
00:41:03,370 --> 00:41:07,420
♫Drunk on the autumn breeze beneath the bright moon♫

568
00:41:08,080 --> 00:41:17,260
♫Penning small verses of a grand legend♫

569
00:41:38,110 --> 00:41:39,170
It's getting cold.

570
00:41:41,040 --> 00:41:43,040
Why are you sitting in the wind here?

571
00:41:48,970 --> 00:41:50,160
Sister,

572
00:41:51,520 --> 00:41:53,440
are you worried about Mr. Zhuo

573
00:41:55,590 --> 00:41:57,120
and Bai Jiu?

574
00:42:00,040 --> 00:42:01,930
Jiu is the youngest among us

575
00:42:03,310 --> 00:42:05,040
and doesn't know martial arts.

576
00:42:05,750 --> 00:42:07,110
He's very timid.

577
00:42:08,330 --> 00:42:09,910
When there was danger,

578
00:42:10,880 --> 00:42:13,380
he always hid behind me and Zhuo.

579
00:42:15,460 --> 00:42:17,890
I wonder how he is now.

580
00:42:20,160 --> 00:42:21,580
Is he scared?

581
00:42:25,400 --> 00:42:26,900
You treat Bai Jiu so well…

582
00:42:30,230 --> 00:42:31,870
like he's your own brother.

583
00:42:35,250 --> 00:42:37,200
I used to be weak and sick.

584
00:42:38,710 --> 00:42:40,510
You got used to taking care of me.

585
00:42:44,610 --> 00:42:46,250
Now that I'm a puppet,

586
00:42:48,310 --> 00:42:49,430
I don't feel pain

587
00:42:50,900 --> 00:42:52,150
or get hurt.

588
00:42:54,920 --> 00:42:56,770
I can protect you now.

589
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:00,630
But Bai Jiu is different.

590
00:43:02,520 --> 00:43:04,160
He really needs you.

591
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:07,210
Is that why

592
00:43:08,600 --> 00:43:10,190
you care and worry

593
00:43:11,610 --> 00:43:12,820
so much about him?

594
00:43:20,720 --> 00:43:21,520
Yes.

595
00:43:28,270 --> 00:43:29,750
But Heng

596
00:43:29,770 --> 00:43:30,810
is Heng.

597
00:43:32,230 --> 00:43:33,900
You're never anyone else,

598
00:43:35,380 --> 00:43:37,360
and you'll never be.

599
00:43:40,860 --> 00:43:42,510
No one can replace you.

600
00:43:47,280 --> 00:43:50,010
With you fighting alongside me,

601
00:43:51,950 --> 00:43:54,260
I can protect others better.

602
00:44:03,630 --> 00:44:04,750
I'm happy

603
00:44:07,050 --> 00:44:09,210
that I'm no longer your burden.

604
00:44:09,460 --> 00:44:11,900
I've become your armor.

605
00:44:13,040 --> 00:44:13,840
But...

606
00:44:18,940 --> 00:44:20,090
But what?

607
00:44:26,930 --> 00:44:27,790
Nothing.

608
00:44:58,550 --> 00:44:59,190
Father.

609
00:44:59,880 --> 00:45:00,670
Cloud Light Sword.

610
00:45:00,670 --> 00:45:01,430
Zhuo.

611
00:45:01,800 --> 00:45:02,400
Cloud…

612
00:45:03,470 --> 00:45:04,490
Cloud Light Sword.

613
00:45:04,490 --> 00:45:05,410
Zhuo.

614
00:45:22,330 --> 00:45:23,460
Zhuo.

615
00:45:24,850 --> 00:45:26,110
Where are you going?

616
00:45:26,280 --> 00:45:27,110
Zhuo!
