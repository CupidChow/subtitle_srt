[Fangs of Fortune]

2
00:01:43,210 --> 00:01:45,930
[Episode 19]

3
00:02:19,510 --> 00:02:22,140
Previously, how many demons

4
00:02:22,550 --> 00:02:25,880
have died in this steel cage smeared with the beast's blood?

5
00:02:27,070 --> 00:02:28,240
You are angry

6
00:02:29,820 --> 00:02:32,430
because you saw that I have everything,

7
00:02:34,060 --> 00:02:36,090
but you have nothing.

8
00:02:37,780 --> 00:02:39,090
That's right.

9
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:42,680
You're the reason

10
00:02:44,670 --> 00:02:46,730
I have nothing.

11
00:02:53,620 --> 00:02:55,220
You killed so many people.

12
00:03:21,030 --> 00:03:22,310
How dare you

13
00:03:25,930 --> 00:03:28,450
hurt me for the sake of

14
00:03:28,540 --> 00:03:30,329
humans who killed us demons?

15
00:03:31,100 --> 00:03:33,960
The ones who hurt demons are the people in prison.

16
00:03:36,230 --> 00:03:39,090
These people here, who are suffering from illness,

17
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:42,890
are just here to seek medical treatment.

18
00:03:42,890 --> 00:03:44,220
Humans are all the same.

19
00:03:45,220 --> 00:03:46,680
They hate demons

20
00:03:48,030 --> 00:03:49,410
and despise demons.

21
00:03:50,050 --> 00:03:50,950
Li Lun.

22
00:03:52,690 --> 00:03:54,140
You're wrong.

23
00:03:54,790 --> 00:03:56,660
You're the one who's wrong.

24
00:03:59,770 --> 00:04:01,170
Zhao Yuanzhou.

25
00:04:02,010 --> 00:04:06,380
You betrayed the oath to protect the Wilderness first.

26
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:10,190
I've never betrayed the oath.

27
00:04:11,650 --> 00:04:14,710
It's just that we protect the Wilderness differently.

28
00:04:15,700 --> 00:04:16,959
Even up till now,

29
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:19,720
you still don't understand.

30
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:22,240
Zhao Yuanzhou.

31
00:04:23,650 --> 00:04:26,250
Don't think you're really a human

32
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:29,200
just because you have a mortal name.

33
00:04:30,780 --> 00:04:32,330
You treat them as friends.

34
00:04:33,130 --> 00:04:35,590
But do they really treat you like one of them?

35
00:04:39,110 --> 00:04:39,909
Of course.

36
00:04:40,909 --> 00:04:42,110
Zhao Yuanzhou

37
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:44,060
is my best friend.

38
00:04:46,909 --> 00:04:49,040
He's trying to sow discord between us.

39
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:51,530
Don't listen to him.

40
00:04:52,950 --> 00:04:54,150
I used to be

41
00:04:55,980 --> 00:04:57,740
his best friend too.

42
00:05:01,820 --> 00:05:03,140
Zhao Yuanzhou.

43
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:06,760
You are invincible.

44
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:11,290
Why do you want to be friends with these nobodies?

45
00:05:12,630 --> 00:05:14,140
You wouldn't understand.

46
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:22,270
This Little Bunny may be a crybaby,

47
00:05:22,650 --> 00:05:24,850
but he always risked his life

48
00:05:24,970 --> 00:05:26,830
as we went through thick and thin.

49
00:05:27,700 --> 00:05:29,300
We've been in this together.

50
00:05:30,470 --> 00:05:33,050
Pei Sijing may look cold,

51
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,840
but she's tough on the outside and soft on the inside,

52
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:38,170
and has well-defined likes and dislikes.

53
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:39,630
Thank you.

54
00:05:40,659 --> 00:05:42,000
As for Zhuo Yichen,

55
00:05:45,350 --> 00:05:46,880
I don't want to flatter him,

56
00:05:47,350 --> 00:05:48,840
but he is indeed

57
00:05:49,230 --> 00:05:50,630
a dignified gentleman

58
00:05:51,180 --> 00:05:52,520
with a righteous heart.

59
00:05:53,060 --> 00:05:54,520
He has an unbreakable will

60
00:05:55,570 --> 00:05:57,430
and a character as strong as gold.

61
00:05:59,490 --> 00:06:00,750
As for Wen Xiao,

62
00:06:01,510 --> 00:06:04,110
when everyone was treating me as an evil demon

63
00:06:05,390 --> 00:06:06,390
and had feared me,

64
00:06:07,640 --> 00:06:08,520
hated me,

65
00:06:10,060 --> 00:06:11,550
or respected me,

66
00:06:14,750 --> 00:06:15,810
she was the only one

67
00:06:16,970 --> 00:06:20,020
who still looked at me with warmth and sympathy.

68
00:06:20,060 --> 00:06:20,870
Zhuo,

69
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:24,090
this isn't his true intention.

70
00:06:24,210 --> 00:06:26,670
He's being controlled by malicious energy.

71
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:29,220
Li Lun.

72
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:32,790
After all these years,

73
00:06:34,620 --> 00:06:36,620
you still don't understand.

74
00:06:38,350 --> 00:06:39,770
Okay.

75
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:43,030
Fine.

76
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:49,840
Since you value them so much,

77
00:06:52,310 --> 00:06:54,860
I'll let you witness

78
00:06:55,210 --> 00:06:56,940
your most precious friends

79
00:06:56,980 --> 00:06:58,460
die one by one.

80
00:07:00,630 --> 00:07:02,790
Didn't you say I have nothing?

81
00:07:05,310 --> 00:07:06,390
Don't worry.

82
00:07:08,070 --> 00:07:09,320
Soon,

83
00:07:12,060 --> 00:07:13,960
you will be just like me.

84
00:07:18,270 --> 00:07:19,180
Let him go!

85
00:07:19,460 --> 00:07:21,170
He's the first one.

86
00:07:25,580 --> 00:07:26,450
Jiu!

87
00:07:44,870 --> 00:07:45,870
What is this?

88
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:47,659
Divine power.

89
00:07:48,710 --> 00:07:49,630
Divine power?

90
00:07:50,640 --> 00:07:52,730
Why would Jiu possess divine power?

91
00:07:55,640 --> 00:07:57,790
I've underestimated you.

92
00:08:01,940 --> 00:08:03,270
But...

93
00:08:04,540 --> 00:08:07,600
this is indeed a great gift.

94
00:08:13,070 --> 00:08:13,680
Take it.

95
00:08:13,950 --> 00:08:14,730
Pei Sijing.

96
00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:15,600
Zhuo.

97
00:08:15,620 --> 00:08:17,080
Quick, get Jiu out of here.

98
00:08:19,630 --> 00:08:20,350
Jiu.

99
00:08:45,870 --> 00:08:46,890
Zhuo Yichen!

100
00:08:53,350 --> 00:08:53,950
Jiu!

101
00:08:55,290 --> 00:08:55,880
Jiu!

102
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:01,980
Have you found Yao Water and Divine Wood?

103
00:09:04,840 --> 00:09:05,660
Shut up!

104
00:09:12,700 --> 00:09:13,780
Wen Xiao!

105
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,230
Zhao Yuanzhou.

106
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:23,920
It seems that Baize Goddess

107
00:09:23,950 --> 00:09:26,300
is deeply in love with you.

108
00:09:27,830 --> 00:09:29,680
She blocked

109
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:31,960
all of the curse.

110
00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:44,620
If the blood of Baize runs out,

111
00:10:46,460 --> 00:10:47,980
will there still be

112
00:10:50,270 --> 00:10:53,550
another Baize Goddess?

113
00:11:06,230 --> 00:11:07,860
The game is not over yet.

114
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:11,020
This time it's one or the other again.

115
00:11:12,660 --> 00:11:13,870
Zhao Yuanzhou.

116
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:16,700
Who will you choose this time?

117
00:11:18,410 --> 00:11:19,810
No need for him to choose.

118
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:21,340
I'll choose first.

119
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:22,900
Oh?

120
00:11:23,570 --> 00:11:25,340
I choose for you to die.

121
00:11:29,020 --> 00:11:29,900
Wen Xiao!

122
00:11:54,760 --> 00:11:55,840
Stay here.

123
00:11:55,860 --> 00:11:57,260
I'll go help Zhuo Yichen.

124
00:11:57,510 --> 00:11:58,140
Okay.

125
00:12:31,350 --> 00:12:33,480
I didn't expect the umbrella I gave you

126
00:12:34,990 --> 00:12:37,420
would end up pointing at me.

127
00:12:39,510 --> 00:12:41,800
That's why we never give our good friends

128
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:43,970
umbrellas in the mortal world.

129
00:12:44,780 --> 00:12:46,110
Because umbrellas mean

130
00:12:46,730 --> 00:12:48,060
to go our separate ways.

131
00:12:48,810 --> 00:12:50,380
You chose the umbrella.

132
00:12:51,430 --> 00:12:52,830
It's also your own choice

133
00:12:53,670 --> 00:12:55,580
to go our separate ways.

134
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:42,020
Malicious energy?

135
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:48,600
Zhao Yuanzhou.

136
00:13:50,630 --> 00:13:53,840
You're willing to go this far for them.

137
00:13:55,670 --> 00:13:56,520
Li Lun.

138
00:13:57,460 --> 00:14:00,590
Haven't you wanted me to settle my blood debts all along?

139
00:14:01,220 --> 00:14:01,990
How is this?

140
00:14:02,650 --> 00:14:04,510
I now carry blood with malicious energy.

141
00:14:04,510 --> 00:14:05,910
Isn't that great?

142
00:14:55,130 --> 00:14:56,380
Stop!

143
00:14:59,230 --> 00:14:59,910
Wen Xiao!

144
00:15:36,180 --> 00:15:36,950
Li Lun?

145
00:15:38,420 --> 00:15:39,510
That's right.

146
00:15:41,550 --> 00:15:43,230
As you can see,

147
00:15:44,450 --> 00:15:46,160
I am who I am today

148
00:15:47,090 --> 00:15:49,360
because of you.

149
00:15:49,610 --> 00:15:51,380
Back then, the Ever-Burning Wood

150
00:15:51,380 --> 00:15:53,420
had already entered your body.

151
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:57,760
Your skills also carried the power of the Ever-Burning Wood

152
00:15:58,670 --> 00:16:00,550
and had hurt me too.

153
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:09,320
At that time,

154
00:16:11,640 --> 00:16:12,930
I didn't know...

155
00:16:16,350 --> 00:16:17,610
Ever-Burning Wood...

156
00:16:19,290 --> 00:16:20,450
The Ever-Burning Wood

157
00:16:20,450 --> 00:16:21,870
is a sacred wood

158
00:16:21,870 --> 00:16:23,940
that grows in the Wilderness.

159
00:16:24,630 --> 00:16:26,190
It won't die out even during storms,

160
00:16:26,190 --> 00:16:27,660
and its fire never ceases.

161
00:16:29,310 --> 00:16:31,500
Burns from the Ever-Burning Wood

162
00:16:32,820 --> 00:16:34,420
are incurable.

163
00:16:37,390 --> 00:16:39,660
You gave me agony

164
00:16:39,660 --> 00:16:41,870
that I can never recover from.

165
00:16:45,270 --> 00:16:46,070
Li Lun.

166
00:16:49,810 --> 00:16:52,740
I didn't mean to hurt you with the Ever-Burning Wood.

167
00:16:57,910 --> 00:16:59,070
It's my fault.

168
00:17:02,710 --> 00:17:05,490
Li Lun has taken so many lives in the mortal world.

169
00:17:06,030 --> 00:17:07,359
His sins are plentiful.

170
00:17:07,650 --> 00:17:09,690
We must seal him forever.

171
00:17:10,579 --> 00:17:12,440
Back then, Li Lun and I

172
00:17:12,839 --> 00:17:15,440
used magic to rebuild the White Emperor Tower,

173
00:17:16,089 --> 00:17:18,589
and we swore to protect the Wilderness.

174
00:17:19,060 --> 00:17:20,760
His love for the Wilderness

175
00:17:21,190 --> 00:17:22,750
is deeper than anyone else.

176
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:25,400
But fate played a cruel joke.

177
00:17:26,060 --> 00:17:28,640
Both of you were scalded by the Ever-Burning Wood,

178
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:31,740
with you as the vessel of malicious energy,

179
00:17:32,390 --> 00:17:35,790
and him, who was most afraid of being scalded as a locust tree.

180
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,020
Even if I don't punish Li Lun,

181
00:17:38,350 --> 00:17:40,490
he will burn to ashes

182
00:17:40,710 --> 00:17:42,520
because of the Ever-Burning Wood

183
00:17:42,520 --> 00:17:43,940
and eventually perish.

184
00:17:44,460 --> 00:17:47,300
Therefore, he was imprisoned at the Place of Birth.

185
00:17:47,300 --> 00:17:48,470
Although to him,

186
00:17:48,470 --> 00:17:50,530
it may seem to be an endless sentence,

187
00:17:50,630 --> 00:17:52,160
it's actually a good thing.

188
00:17:52,450 --> 00:17:54,760
Under the Baize Imperial Order,

189
00:17:55,480 --> 00:17:58,430
the curse of the Ever-Burning Wood will also fail.

190
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:01,980
He won't have to endure endless burns,

191
00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:04,860
and he can still survive.

192
00:18:11,560 --> 00:18:12,770
Ridiculous.

193
00:18:14,350 --> 00:18:16,880
To be trapped in a confined space for eternity

194
00:18:16,910 --> 00:18:18,270
is worse than death.

195
00:18:18,290 --> 00:18:20,020
I am just a worthless prisoner.

196
00:18:20,170 --> 00:18:21,660
What's the point?

197
00:18:22,820 --> 00:18:25,420
I'd rather be burned to ashes

198
00:18:27,110 --> 00:18:29,110
and spread across heaven and earth.

199
00:18:32,890 --> 00:18:34,790
Baize Goddess.

200
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:40,880
This is all your fault.

201
00:18:41,480 --> 00:18:43,160
It's always your fault.

202
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:54,250
A life without death.

203
00:18:59,560 --> 00:19:01,990
You will kill him one day.

204
00:19:03,720 --> 00:19:05,620
Do you think you would have won...

205
00:19:19,410 --> 00:19:21,520
just because you killed Zhou Yuanzhou?

206
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:22,970
Without Divine Wood

207
00:19:23,720 --> 00:19:25,110
and Yao Water,

208
00:19:26,840 --> 00:19:29,560
there's no way to repair the Baize Token.

209
00:19:31,990 --> 00:19:33,750
Everything is destined.

210
00:19:37,170 --> 00:19:38,410
Zhao Yuanzhou.

211
00:19:39,930 --> 00:19:43,590
The day the malicious energy in your body goes out of control again

212
00:19:44,870 --> 00:19:48,400
shall be the day the mortal world gets buried with you.

213
00:19:51,180 --> 00:19:52,430
By then,

214
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:55,880
I wonder if your friends

215
00:19:57,630 --> 00:19:59,200
will choose to kill you

216
00:20:01,790 --> 00:20:03,960
or die with you.

217
00:20:40,220 --> 00:20:41,460
Zhao Yuanzhou.

218
00:22:23,980 --> 00:22:26,040
If you want to repair the Baize Token,

219
00:22:26,230 --> 00:22:27,820
we must use the purest and

220
00:22:27,880 --> 00:22:29,440
cleanest Yao Water.

221
00:22:30,350 --> 00:22:31,830
But now, the Yao Water

222
00:22:32,230 --> 00:22:35,010
has been polluted by Li Lun

223
00:22:35,080 --> 00:22:36,880
with the blood of Baize Goddess.

224
00:22:36,900 --> 00:22:39,230
I'm afraid it has lost its effectiveness.

225
00:22:41,370 --> 00:22:42,950
Let's put it away first.

226
00:22:44,190 --> 00:22:46,120
Maybe we'll find a way to purify it.

227
00:22:47,650 --> 00:22:49,620
Even if we can purify the Yao Water,

228
00:22:51,420 --> 00:22:52,800
Li Lun said

229
00:22:52,970 --> 00:22:54,870
the Divine Wood no longer exists.

230
00:22:55,130 --> 00:22:57,600
How will we repair the Baize Token?

231
00:23:01,560 --> 00:23:03,400
Don’t worry, Mr. Zhuo.

232
00:23:04,270 --> 00:23:05,590
One month later,

233
00:23:05,630 --> 00:23:07,890
if we still can’t repair the Baize Token,

234
00:23:08,280 --> 00:23:09,920
you can just kill me.

235
00:23:11,680 --> 00:23:13,890
I can use all my divine power

236
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,490
to suppress Zhao Yuanzhou's malicious energy

237
00:23:16,490 --> 00:23:17,900
for a month at most.

238
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:23,220
We just fought together.

239
00:23:23,690 --> 00:23:25,810
Now, you are asking someone to kill you.

240
00:23:25,810 --> 00:23:27,610
You demons are truly heartless.

241
00:23:28,670 --> 00:23:31,070
I also hope you could be equally heartless.

242
00:23:31,610 --> 00:23:33,300
Because people with hearts

243
00:23:34,290 --> 00:23:35,620
live in misery.

244
00:23:38,520 --> 00:23:39,880
You lack a heart.

245
00:23:40,510 --> 00:23:42,440
But aren't you living in agony too?

246
00:23:43,330 --> 00:23:44,530
Nature is merciless,

247
00:23:44,800 --> 00:23:46,100
and all beings suffer.

248
00:23:46,710 --> 00:23:48,870
Since we are born into this world,

249
00:23:50,280 --> 00:23:51,670
we should all live well.

250
00:23:54,630 --> 00:23:56,150
Zhuo is right.

251
00:23:57,410 --> 00:23:59,590
You mustn't always think about dying.

252
00:24:00,230 --> 00:24:02,630
And have you forgotten the pact between us?

253
00:24:02,690 --> 00:24:05,550
You still have to work for the Demon Hunting Bureau.

254
00:24:06,690 --> 00:24:08,550
The Baizen Token remains broken,

255
00:24:09,030 --> 00:24:11,430
and the Wilderness still needs to be saved.

256
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:14,680
You haven't paid off your debt.

257
00:24:16,530 --> 00:24:17,840
It won't be that easy.

258
00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:22,340
Fine.

259
00:24:25,380 --> 00:24:26,910
But we are still enemies...

260
00:24:29,080 --> 00:24:30,460
but also colleagues.

261
00:24:36,190 --> 00:24:37,120
Thank you.

262
00:24:38,420 --> 00:24:39,550
What for?

263
00:24:40,040 --> 00:24:41,530
I'm thanking Ms. Wen Xiao.

264
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:42,710
You!

265
00:25:07,320 --> 00:25:09,050
This is Mount Kunlun.

266
00:25:09,340 --> 00:25:10,720
What are you mortals

267
00:25:10,750 --> 00:25:11,840
doing here?

268
00:25:12,570 --> 00:25:14,820
It is said that the Demon Hunting Bureau and Chongwu Camp

269
00:25:14,820 --> 00:25:16,230
are never on good terms.

270
00:25:16,570 --> 00:25:17,790
But this time,

271
00:25:17,930 --> 00:25:19,550
we have the same goal.

272
00:25:21,040 --> 00:25:22,470
What exactly do you want?

273
00:25:24,350 --> 00:25:26,340
Arrest Zhao Yuanzhou.

274
00:25:28,430 --> 00:25:29,900
Zhao Yuanzhou is not here.

275
00:25:30,520 --> 00:25:31,940
Who said I'm not here?

276
00:25:37,230 --> 00:25:37,950
Wow.

277
00:25:38,200 --> 00:25:39,960
What's with the big reception?

278
00:25:46,190 --> 00:25:46,990
Guards.

279
00:25:47,870 --> 00:25:49,810
Arrest Zhao Yuanzhou.

280
00:25:50,460 --> 00:25:51,490
Mr. Zhen Mei.

281
00:25:52,220 --> 00:25:53,900
My godfather, Mr. Fan Ying,

282
00:25:53,920 --> 00:25:55,600
is your equal in rank.

283
00:25:56,150 --> 00:25:57,950
Chongwu Camp and Demon Hunting Bureau

284
00:25:57,950 --> 00:26:00,480
are neither in a hierarchical relationship.

285
00:26:00,970 --> 00:26:02,050
How about

286
00:26:02,690 --> 00:26:03,390
we leave it to

287
00:26:03,390 --> 00:26:06,110
a fair and open third party,

288
00:26:06,850 --> 00:26:08,470
the Prime Minister's representative,

289
00:26:08,470 --> 00:26:10,530
Ms. Pei Sijing, to make the decision?

290
00:26:17,640 --> 00:26:18,440
Sure.

291
00:26:24,830 --> 00:26:27,290
Zhao Yuanzhou shall be at the disposal of...

292
00:26:29,730 --> 00:26:31,010
Chongwu Camp.

293
00:26:37,580 --> 00:26:38,630
Ms. Pei?

294
00:26:39,480 --> 00:26:40,380
It's okay.

295
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:42,130
I am interested to see

296
00:26:42,510 --> 00:26:44,670
whether the Demon Hunting Bureau's prison cell

297
00:26:44,670 --> 00:26:47,000
is more comfortable than Chongwu Camp's.

298
00:26:47,480 --> 00:26:48,440
Mr. Zhen Mei.

299
00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:51,480
I await your punishment.

300
00:26:53,830 --> 00:26:54,630
Are you crazy?

301
00:26:56,770 --> 00:26:57,580
Don't worry.

302
00:27:21,340 --> 00:27:22,960
Almond buttermilk?

303
00:27:27,100 --> 00:27:28,020
Jiu.

304
00:27:28,190 --> 00:27:29,350
You've grown up.

305
00:27:29,860 --> 00:27:31,020
There are a lot of things

306
00:27:31,020 --> 00:27:33,270
Daddy shouldn't keep from you anymore.

307
00:27:33,290 --> 00:27:34,630
When you return to Tiandu,

308
00:27:34,630 --> 00:27:35,890
come and look for me.

309
00:27:35,990 --> 00:27:38,080
I'll take you to see your mother

310
00:27:38,110 --> 00:27:40,030
and tell you everything.

311
00:27:49,790 --> 00:27:50,580
My child.

312
00:27:51,900 --> 00:27:54,740
There are three thousand paths to arrive in this world,

313
00:27:54,740 --> 00:27:56,980
and there are thirty thousand paths for your return.

314
00:27:56,980 --> 00:27:59,750
As for which one is right for you,

315
00:28:00,660 --> 00:28:02,320
you have to find out yourself.

316
00:28:05,030 --> 00:28:05,830
Ying Lei.

317
00:28:12,460 --> 00:28:13,260
Mr. Lu Wu?

318
00:28:13,800 --> 00:28:15,980
I was initially stationed at Zhongshan.

319
00:28:15,980 --> 00:28:17,930
I heard that Mr. Ying Zhao had died,

320
00:28:17,970 --> 00:28:19,210
so I rushed over

321
00:28:19,420 --> 00:28:21,380
to guard Mount Kunlun with you.

322
00:28:21,790 --> 00:28:22,830
So Grandpa

323
00:28:22,970 --> 00:28:24,700
had already prepared for this.

324
00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:29,590
Thank you, Mr. Lu Wu.

325
00:28:31,480 --> 00:28:32,800
I'll try my best

326
00:28:33,670 --> 00:28:34,930
to become

327
00:28:34,950 --> 00:28:36,080
a good Mountain God.

328
00:28:40,330 --> 00:28:41,560
Mr. Lu Wu.

329
00:28:41,930 --> 00:28:43,660
I have a favor to ask.

330
00:28:43,690 --> 00:28:44,260
Oh?

331
00:28:44,280 --> 00:28:45,190
Tell me.

332
00:28:47,320 --> 00:28:49,600
Do you know how to purify Yao Water?

333
00:29:00,600 --> 00:29:02,280
Watch him closely.

334
00:29:02,630 --> 00:29:04,030
If anything goes wrong,

335
00:29:04,140 --> 00:29:05,530
you will be beheaded.

336
00:29:05,710 --> 00:29:06,220
Yes.

337
00:29:35,680 --> 00:29:37,810
They are to execute Zhao Yuanzhou now?

338
00:29:38,200 --> 00:29:40,460
It's the Prime Minister's secret order.

339
00:29:41,510 --> 00:29:43,370
He must be executed immediately.

340
00:29:43,560 --> 00:29:45,380
Then let them do it.

341
00:29:45,480 --> 00:29:47,610
They can't kill Zhao Yuanzhou anyway.

342
00:29:48,030 --> 00:29:50,160
At most, he'll suffer a little.

343
00:29:50,740 --> 00:29:53,110
That's why I called you here late at night.

344
00:29:54,660 --> 00:29:56,060
The Prime Minister knows

345
00:29:56,110 --> 00:29:58,510
only your Cloud Light Sword can kill him.

346
00:29:59,720 --> 00:30:01,560
He has specially ordered

347
00:30:02,550 --> 00:30:05,780
you to execute Zhao Yuanzhou.

348
00:30:07,520 --> 00:30:08,430
Zhuo.

349
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:10,600
The greater good is at stake.

350
00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:12,470
That's exactly why

351
00:30:13,740 --> 00:30:15,540
I shouldn't kill Zhao Yuanzhou.

352
00:30:17,790 --> 00:30:18,700
At least,

353
00:30:19,330 --> 00:30:20,410
not now.

354
00:30:21,860 --> 00:30:22,740
Are you crazy?

355
00:30:25,100 --> 00:30:25,970
Don't worry.

356
00:30:28,810 --> 00:30:30,970
[See you at Tiandu]

357
00:30:34,760 --> 00:30:35,890
Zhuo,

358
00:30:36,460 --> 00:30:39,120
haven't you always wanted to kill Zhao Yuanzhou

359
00:30:40,090 --> 00:30:42,170
and avenge your father and brother?

360
00:30:47,420 --> 00:30:49,820
Zhao Yuanzhou killed my father and brother

361
00:30:50,030 --> 00:30:52,560
under the influence of his malicious energy.

362
00:30:53,260 --> 00:30:54,630
The real murderer

363
00:30:55,950 --> 00:30:58,880
is the malicious energy that transverses the world.

364
00:30:59,910 --> 00:31:01,160
And Zhao Yuanzhou

365
00:31:02,150 --> 00:31:03,480
happens to be the blade.

366
00:31:05,790 --> 00:31:07,210
These days,

367
00:31:07,420 --> 00:31:08,810
travelling with him,

368
00:31:10,600 --> 00:31:12,640
I saw a different side of him.

369
00:31:14,120 --> 00:31:15,400
He is indeed

370
00:31:15,720 --> 00:31:18,380
a compassionate and righteous demon.

371
00:31:22,260 --> 00:31:23,210
So,

372
00:31:24,130 --> 00:31:26,190
you are no longer willing to kill him?

373
00:31:26,800 --> 00:31:27,860
A knife's morality

374
00:31:28,260 --> 00:31:29,830
is determined by

375
00:31:30,300 --> 00:31:32,020
the hand that holds it.

376
00:31:34,930 --> 00:31:36,660
The two realms are in turmoil,

377
00:31:36,910 --> 00:31:38,830
and the Wilderness is in danger.

378
00:31:39,390 --> 00:31:42,650
We must repair the damaged Baize Token as soon as possible.

379
00:31:43,040 --> 00:31:45,070
We need Zhao Yuanzhou’s help.

380
00:31:46,550 --> 00:31:48,310
The Baize Token is broken?

381
00:31:50,080 --> 00:31:53,480
Then all the more we must execute Zhao Yuanzhou immediately.

382
00:31:55,130 --> 00:31:57,560
No wonder Prime Minister did not dare to risk it,

383
00:31:57,560 --> 00:31:59,100
and even more so for myself.

384
00:31:59,120 --> 00:31:59,920
Mr. Fan.

385
00:32:00,600 --> 00:32:01,780
Say no more.

386
00:32:01,810 --> 00:32:02,870
This is the Prime Minister's order.

387
00:32:02,870 --> 00:32:04,070
You must carry it out.

388
00:32:04,110 --> 00:32:05,030
Father.

389
00:32:05,060 --> 00:32:06,080
The Prime Minister is being unreasonable.

390
00:32:06,080 --> 00:32:08,140
Are you going to be unreasonable too?

391
00:32:08,840 --> 00:32:09,640
Xiao.

392
00:32:11,350 --> 00:32:13,250
Xiao, you mustn't speak recklessly about the Prime Minister.

393
00:32:13,250 --> 00:32:14,720
Prime Minister has the world in his heart.

394
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:16,530
How could he disregard the safety of the people

395
00:32:16,530 --> 00:32:18,110
and leave behind endless troubles?

396
00:32:18,110 --> 00:32:18,630
Fine.

397
00:32:18,990 --> 00:32:21,190
I'll talk to the Prime Minister myself.

398
00:32:21,250 --> 00:32:21,860
Wen Xiao!

399
00:32:21,880 --> 00:32:22,400
Xiao!

400
00:32:22,510 --> 00:32:23,070
Xiao!

401
00:32:23,270 --> 00:32:23,990
Stop her!

402
00:32:47,680 --> 00:32:48,730
Brother!

403
00:32:50,140 --> 00:32:51,460
Zhu Jian's blood...

404
00:32:52,820 --> 00:32:55,340
How many demons

405
00:32:55,830 --> 00:32:59,160
have died in this steel cage smeared with the beast's blood?

406
00:33:35,270 --> 00:33:41,850
[Book of Rites]

407
00:33:47,190 --> 00:33:49,150
I didn't ask Mr. Torch Dragon

408
00:33:49,150 --> 00:33:50,380
to help me become the top student in the imperial exam.

409
00:33:50,380 --> 00:33:51,490
I relied on my own abilities

410
00:33:51,490 --> 00:33:53,750
to go to the capital for the examination.

411
00:34:01,030 --> 00:34:04,950
You proposed to the court to rebuild the Demon Hunting Bureau.

412
00:34:05,540 --> 00:34:08,540
Although the Prime Minister strongly vouched for it,

413
00:34:09,159 --> 00:34:11,520
the Chongwu Camp is interfering.

414
00:34:11,710 --> 00:34:12,570
Chongwu Camp

415
00:34:12,590 --> 00:34:14,300
exaggerated and twisted the truth.

416
00:34:14,300 --> 00:34:16,159
Fortunately, the Prime Minister pleaded for us,

417
00:34:16,159 --> 00:34:17,449
and got us

418
00:34:17,489 --> 00:34:18,889
one last day of pardon.

419
00:34:48,739 --> 00:34:50,120
Who are you?

420
00:34:50,630 --> 00:34:52,030
Why are you kneeling?

421
00:34:56,469 --> 00:34:58,470
Prime Minister, please forgive me.

422
00:34:59,640 --> 00:35:02,040
I'm Wen Xiao from the Demon Hunting Bureau.

423
00:35:02,510 --> 00:35:04,550
I stopped your carriage

424
00:35:05,350 --> 00:35:06,730
because...

425
00:35:07,780 --> 00:35:09,910
I have something important to ask for.

426
00:35:44,120 --> 00:35:46,410
Thank you for your cooperation, Ms. Pei.

427
00:35:46,750 --> 00:35:50,280
It's thanks to you that our collaboration can be this flawless.

428
00:35:51,410 --> 00:35:53,390
Stall them in Sinan Water Town.

429
00:35:53,410 --> 00:35:54,610
Can you do it?

430
00:35:56,340 --> 00:35:57,310
It has to be

431
00:35:57,740 --> 00:35:58,960
just the right time.

432
00:35:59,130 --> 00:36:00,590
Three or four days will do.

433
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:15,130
What did Zhen Mei offer as a deal

434
00:36:15,670 --> 00:36:17,540
for you to be a mole?

435
00:36:20,870 --> 00:36:21,750
My brother.

436
00:36:23,850 --> 00:36:25,390
Isn't your brother...

437
00:36:27,800 --> 00:36:29,520
Zhen Mei spoke to me just now.

438
00:36:30,470 --> 00:36:31,980
He said he faked his death.

439
00:36:33,340 --> 00:36:34,790
He's still alive.

440
00:36:34,980 --> 00:36:36,640
If I ever want to see him again,

441
00:36:38,080 --> 00:36:39,840
I have to work for them.

442
00:36:40,600 --> 00:36:42,150
But you clearly know that

443
00:36:43,120 --> 00:36:44,180
your brother

444
00:36:45,360 --> 00:36:46,550
is indeed dead.

445
00:36:57,880 --> 00:36:59,130
I know.

446
00:37:04,240 --> 00:37:05,910
I used Chaotic Impermanence

447
00:37:05,960 --> 00:37:07,950
to let you see your brother again.

448
00:37:08,760 --> 00:37:10,760
Although he exists only as a puppet,

449
00:37:11,130 --> 00:37:13,000
you still owe me a favor.

450
00:37:13,750 --> 00:37:14,990
Ms. Pei,

451
00:37:15,420 --> 00:37:17,340
shouldn't you also help me?

452
00:37:23,390 --> 00:37:25,120
What do you want me to do for you?

453
00:37:26,070 --> 00:37:28,070
Just keep pretending to be his mole,

454
00:37:28,640 --> 00:37:30,510
so that I can

455
00:37:30,630 --> 00:37:32,710
find out the secrets of Chongwu Camp.

456
00:37:34,100 --> 00:37:34,900
Okay.

457
00:37:35,990 --> 00:37:37,980
Should I tell Wen Xiao and Mr. Zhuo?

458
00:37:40,070 --> 00:37:40,860
No.

459
00:37:42,280 --> 00:37:43,940
You don't even trust Wen Xiao.

460
00:37:47,470 --> 00:37:49,910
I don't want to put her in any danger.

461
00:37:50,470 --> 00:37:51,530
Besides,

462
00:37:51,850 --> 00:37:54,300
making Wen Xiao and Zhuo angry

463
00:37:54,760 --> 00:37:56,400
will make our plan

464
00:37:56,760 --> 00:37:58,760
seem more realistic and trustable.

465
00:38:02,820 --> 00:38:04,280
You demon

466
00:38:06,300 --> 00:38:07,580
are really evil.

467
00:38:15,100 --> 00:38:16,900
Tomorrow, the blood moon rises.

468
00:38:17,440 --> 00:38:18,870
Would anything go wrong

469
00:38:19,490 --> 00:38:21,100
with this formation?

470
00:38:22,600 --> 00:38:24,450
I hope I'm not mistaken.

471
00:38:25,920 --> 00:38:28,490
The formation requires the help of two Mountain Gods.

472
00:38:28,490 --> 00:38:30,020
I've got it all figured out.

473
00:38:30,360 --> 00:38:32,560
To prevent someone from destroying it,

474
00:38:33,880 --> 00:38:35,140
when necessary,

475
00:38:35,170 --> 00:38:37,460
I'll let Ying Lei play it by ear.

476
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:39,030
After all,

477
00:38:39,210 --> 00:38:42,410
even though he's young, he's still a Mountain God anyway.

478
00:38:46,040 --> 00:38:47,450
By the way, Sister Pei,

479
00:38:47,470 --> 00:38:48,600
where are you going?

480
00:38:49,250 --> 00:38:51,980
The Chongwu Camp is great at tracking.

481
00:38:52,530 --> 00:38:53,940
For safety's sake,

482
00:38:53,960 --> 00:38:55,530
I’ll patrol around.

483
00:38:56,630 --> 00:38:58,510
Ms. Pei, you're really something.

484
00:38:58,510 --> 00:39:00,220
You actually found me here.

485
00:39:00,640 --> 00:39:01,600
Who are you?

486
00:39:02,110 --> 00:39:03,460

00:39:12,630 --> 00:39:13,260
we leave it to

00:39:16,560 --> 00:39:17,920
to make the decision?

496
00:39:18,370 --> 00:39:20,630
Zhao Yuanzhou shall be at the disposal of

497
00:39:20,640 --> 00:39:22,260
Chongwu Camp.

498
00:39:27,450 --> 00:39:28,540
Ms. Pei.

Otherwise,

504
00:39:56,860 --> 00:39:58,870
I really wouldn't know how to get out of this

prison cell smeared with the beast's blood.

506

Rumor has it that

507
00:40:04,870 --> 00:40:06,350
the demons captured were

508
00:40:06,520 --> 00:40:09,050
used for research by the mysterious advisor.

509
00:40:11,420 --> 00:40:12,570
Eight years ago,

510
00:40:13,130 --> 00:40:15,590
Li Lun and I were playing in the mortal world.

511
00:40:16,500 --> 00:40:18,830
One time, we took shelter in Jixin Clinic.

512
00:40:19,410 --> 00:40:21,070
I accidentally found out that

513
00:40:21,310 --> 00:40:23,570
there was a dungeon hidden underground.

514
00:40:24,260 --> 00:40:26,550
It's very similar to the layout here.

515
00:40:28,190 --> 00:40:28,900
It should also be designed

516
00:40:28,900 --> 00:40:31,150
by this mysterious advisor.

517
00:40:35,900 --> 00:40:37,500
Now, we have solid evidence.

518
00:40:37,750 --> 00:40:39,850
I want to report it to the Prime Minister.

519
00:40:39,850 --> 00:40:42,060
I seldom have guests here.

520
00:40:48,390 --> 00:40:50,020
Stop playing tricks.

521
00:40:50,790 --> 00:40:52,540
I know who you are.

522
00:40:52,800 --> 00:40:55,760
Take off that ugly mask of yours,

523
00:40:56,440 --> 00:40:58,320
Mr. Wen Zongyu.

524
00:41:00,390 --> 00:41:01,600
You've guessed it.

525
00:41:03,040 --> 00:41:04,700
During the case of the plague,

526
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:07,880
you gave yourself a reason to appear at Sinan Water Town.

527
00:41:07,880 --> 00:41:09,180
I'm Wen Zongyu.

528
00:41:09,600 --> 00:41:11,150
Nice to meet you, Mr. Zhuo.

529
00:41:11,170 --> 00:41:12,370
Right after you left,

530
00:41:12,820 --> 00:41:15,240
a mysterious man took Zhuo away.

531
00:41:20,920 --> 00:41:22,120
Just because of this?

532
00:41:23,920 --> 00:41:25,390
Eight years ago,

533
00:41:26,620 --> 00:41:29,150
you were the doctor in charge of Jixin Clinic.

534
00:41:31,280 --> 00:41:34,110
In the secret dungeon under Jixin Clinic,

535
00:41:34,140 --> 00:41:36,590
all the dirty deeds there

536
00:41:37,510 --> 00:41:39,110
were also your doing, right?

537
00:42:04,130 --> 00:42:06,100
I underestimated you,

538
00:42:07,080 --> 00:42:08,670
Zhao Yuanzhou.

539
00:42:10,990 --> 00:42:12,330
What do you want to do

540
00:42:12,900 --> 00:42:14,160
with all these demons?

541
00:42:15,600 --> 00:42:17,980
It's only natural to kill them if they're caught.

542
00:42:17,980 --> 00:42:20,580
But that's not my only wish.

543
00:42:20,830 --> 00:42:22,710
I hope one day

544
00:42:23,550 --> 00:42:26,060
I'll kill all the demons in the world.

545
00:42:27,130 --> 00:42:28,380
Zhao Yuanzhou.

546
00:42:28,510 --> 00:42:30,510
I've always wanted your inner core.

547
00:42:31,010 --> 00:42:34,390
I didn't expect you to come here in person today.

548
00:42:35,310 --> 00:42:37,350
You're just a mere mortal.

549
00:42:38,200 --> 00:42:40,610
How dare you take my inner core?

550
00:42:41,170 --> 00:42:43,370
Aren't you afraid of hurting yourself?

551
00:42:43,600 --> 00:42:45,460
Indeed, it's a challenging task.

552
00:42:46,620 --> 00:42:49,960
But I heard as long as the demon's five senses are sealed,

553
00:42:50,570 --> 00:42:53,370
its inner core will automatically leave its body.

554
00:42:54,040 --> 00:42:56,280
I have affected your sense of taste,

555
00:42:57,420 --> 00:42:58,010
smell,

556
00:42:58,800 --> 00:42:59,630
sight,

557
00:43:00,100 --> 00:43:00,980
and voice.

558
00:43:01,510 --> 00:43:03,640
Haven't you noticed?

559
00:43:10,870 --> 00:43:12,380
So it was him.

560
00:43:14,180 --> 00:43:15,310
What?

561
00:43:15,770 --> 00:43:16,540
Who is it?

562
00:43:18,270 --> 00:43:19,470
Ms. Pei.

563
00:43:20,890 --> 00:43:23,150
Looks like you're destined to be cheated

564
00:43:23,660 --> 00:43:26,210
by your brother for your whole life.
