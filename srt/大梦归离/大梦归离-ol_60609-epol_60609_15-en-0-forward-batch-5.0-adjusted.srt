[Episode 15]

3
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:53,710
If the two halves of the Baize Token are merged outside our bodies,

4
00:01:53,710 --> 00:01:55,470
can it be returned

5
00:01:55,630 --> 00:01:57,500
to Baize Goddess?

6
00:01:58,030 --> 00:01:59,229
Brat,

7
00:01:59,229 --> 00:02:01,150
you finally said that.

8
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:02,880
So you know your place.

9
00:02:03,070 --> 00:02:05,430
I thought you were going to keep it for yourself.

10
00:02:03,130 --> 00:02:05,790
♫A lone boat drifts through the world♫

11
00:02:05,550 --> 00:02:06,990
I don't want it.

12
00:02:05,820 --> 00:02:08,330
♫The heart feels bitter, then sweet♫

13
00:02:07,510 --> 00:02:08,670
The responsibility is too heavy.

14
00:02:08,540 --> 00:02:13,590
♫Can't distinguish night from day♫

15
00:02:09,630 --> 00:02:12,030
I just want to be a free great demon.

16
00:02:13,020 --> 00:02:14,270
Go wherever I want

17
00:02:14,669 --> 00:02:16,020
and do whatever I want

18
00:02:14,910 --> 00:02:16,760
♫At the edge of the dreamscape♫

19
00:02:16,430 --> 00:02:17,690
without a care in the world.

20
00:02:16,910 --> 00:02:19,630
♫Someone is longing for♫

00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:21,200
♫Softly calling for♫

♫A past that can't be brought back♫

23
00:02:22,550 --> 00:02:24,190
Activating the Constellation Formation

24
00:02:24,190 --> 00:02:26,760
requires two Mountain Gods.

25
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:27,750
By then,

26
00:02:27,750 --> 00:02:28,590
Zhu Yin and I

27
00:02:28,670 --> 00:02:29,950
will assist them

28
00:02:30,230 --> 00:02:31,030
from the side.

29
00:02:32,070 --> 00:02:33,070
You two

30
00:02:33,110 --> 00:02:34,390
just need to

31
00:02:34,750 --> 00:02:37,310
activate the Baize Token in the formation.

32
00:02:38,990 --> 00:02:39,820
Great.

33
00:02:40,310 --> 00:02:41,910
The Wilderness can be saved.

34
00:02:54,410 --> 00:02:55,400
Sister Pei.

35
00:03:02,530 --> 00:03:04,990
Zhuo is still up there trying to cheer Jiu up.

36
00:03:05,530 --> 00:03:06,930
Jiu is too young.

37
00:03:07,790 --> 00:03:10,450
He doesn't understand that it wasn't personal.

38
00:03:10,710 --> 00:03:12,750
It's just that the situation was perilous

39
00:03:12,750 --> 00:03:14,080
and we had to be careful.

40
00:03:14,270 --> 00:03:15,390
You're right.

41
00:03:17,870 --> 00:03:19,350
But the plan of the Demon Hunting Bureau

42
00:03:19,350 --> 00:03:21,480
was indeed leaked to the Chongwu Camp.

43
00:03:22,100 --> 00:03:23,800
So I don't think

44
00:03:24,150 --> 00:03:26,050
Mr. Situ is mistaken

45
00:03:26,110 --> 00:03:27,340
about the mole.

46
00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:32,260
By the way, Sister Pei,

47
00:03:32,750 --> 00:03:33,880
where are you going?

48
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:40,420
The Chongwu Camp is great at tracking,

49
00:03:40,860 --> 00:03:42,520
especially tracking demons.

50
00:03:42,790 --> 00:03:44,320
They've never failed at it.

51
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:45,610
Maybe

52
00:03:46,020 --> 00:03:47,970
they tracked Zhao Yuanzhou here.

53
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:50,600
For safety's sake,

54
00:03:50,780 --> 00:03:52,450
I'll go check the perimeter.

55
00:04:16,430 --> 00:04:17,560
I'm just a kid.

56
00:04:17,830 --> 00:04:19,120
It's easy to cheer me up.

57
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:20,400
Just some candy

58
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:21,860
or a pat on the head will do.

59
00:04:26,589 --> 00:04:28,050
Did you just throw it at me?

60
00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:44,220
Don't you like fruit?

61
00:05:24,350 --> 00:05:25,150
Grandpa.

62
00:05:26,100 --> 00:05:27,290
All these years,

63
00:05:27,320 --> 00:05:28,750
you've been protecting Mount Kunlun,

64
00:05:28,750 --> 00:05:30,530
which is on the brink of destruction.

65
00:05:30,530 --> 00:05:31,810
Don't you feel tired?

66
00:05:32,950 --> 00:05:34,070
I do,

67
00:05:35,790 --> 00:05:37,150
but it's my duty.

68
00:05:41,990 --> 00:05:42,790
Boy,

69
00:05:43,830 --> 00:05:46,070
do you know what it takes

70
00:05:46,070 --> 00:05:47,600
to become the Mountain God?

71
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:51,140
One needs to have divine blood

72
00:05:51,730 --> 00:05:53,530
and be very powerful.

73
00:05:56,700 --> 00:05:58,140
Wrong.

74
00:05:58,760 --> 00:06:01,350
What makes you the Mountain God

75
00:06:02,230 --> 00:06:03,510
is your determination

76
00:06:03,510 --> 00:06:06,720
to protect the Wilderness.

77
00:06:15,060 --> 00:06:15,990
Boy.

78
00:06:18,210 --> 00:06:20,040
Whether to stay in the Wilderness

79
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:21,610
or go to the mortal world

80
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:23,380
is your decision

81
00:06:23,410 --> 00:06:24,880
to make.

82
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:27,730
No matter what your choice is,

83
00:06:28,460 --> 00:06:30,120
I'll support you.

84
00:06:31,310 --> 00:06:32,150
In this world,

85
00:06:32,630 --> 00:06:34,410
there are thousands of paths

86
00:06:34,590 --> 00:06:36,440
leading to your destination.

87
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:39,990
As for which one is right for you,

88
00:06:41,430 --> 00:06:43,090
you have to find out yourself.

89
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:07,150
Sure enough.

90
00:07:07,150 --> 00:07:07,830
You wouldn't waste

91
00:07:07,830 --> 00:07:09,590
the fruit Mr. Zhuo gave you.

92
00:07:10,150 --> 00:07:11,410
None of your business.

93
00:07:12,950 --> 00:07:15,530
Looks like Zhuo messed up his apology.

94
00:07:15,990 --> 00:07:17,640
He's really stupid.

95
00:07:21,110 --> 00:07:22,320
I called him stupid.

96
00:07:22,430 --> 00:07:23,690
Why are you angry?

97
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:25,380
If they had suspected you,

98
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:26,960
would you be angry?

99
00:07:27,670 --> 00:07:29,670
As long as I have a clear conscience,

100
00:07:29,910 --> 00:07:31,510
I don't care

101
00:07:31,630 --> 00:07:32,960
what others think of me.

102
00:07:37,950 --> 00:07:39,409
But rumors are scary.

103
00:07:39,830 --> 00:07:41,220
Born in the Wilderness,

104
00:07:42,030 --> 00:07:44,490
you naturally don't know what rumors can do.

105
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:46,970
So it's better to be a demon.

106
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:49,240
I don't need to guess what others think.

107
00:07:50,870 --> 00:07:51,790
Where are you going?

108
00:07:51,790 --> 00:07:53,320
I'm going to do something bad.

109
00:07:53,320 --> 00:07:55,120
To find some demons and have fun.

110
00:07:56,380 --> 00:07:57,990
When did Little Bunny learn

111
00:07:57,990 --> 00:07:59,390
to speak sarcastically?

112
00:07:59,710 --> 00:08:01,110
You've rubbed off on him.

113
00:08:09,310 --> 00:08:10,670
It's just the two of us now.

114
00:08:10,670 --> 00:08:11,300
Tell me.

115
00:08:19,190 --> 00:08:19,990
Tell you what?

116
00:08:21,350 --> 00:08:22,700
What day is it tomorrow?

117
00:08:22,910 --> 00:08:24,270
What will happen?

118
00:08:25,450 --> 00:08:27,160
You looked worried just now.

119
00:08:27,270 --> 00:08:29,730
There's definitely something on your mind.

120
00:08:30,790 --> 00:08:32,430
Lady Goddess, I didn't expect you

121
00:08:32,430 --> 00:08:34,030
to pay so much attention to me.

122
00:08:34,030 --> 00:08:35,110
I'm so touched.

123
00:08:36,910 --> 00:08:38,140
I have no choice.

124
00:08:38,549 --> 00:08:40,270
To make the Baize Token complete,

125
00:08:40,270 --> 00:08:41,950
we must be of one mind.

126
00:08:47,630 --> 00:08:49,070
You once asked me

127
00:08:50,150 --> 00:08:52,480
why I was controlled by malicious energy.

128
00:08:56,030 --> 00:08:57,670
You didn't answer me then.

129
00:09:02,030 --> 00:09:03,670
The night I lost control,

130
00:09:05,390 --> 00:09:06,780
it was a blood moon.

131
00:09:10,790 --> 00:09:11,590
Blood moon?

132
00:09:13,030 --> 00:09:14,390
On a blood moon,

133
00:09:15,380 --> 00:09:17,380
malicious energy is the strongest.

134
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:21,120
With so much malicious energy in me,

135
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:23,830
if I can't control it,

136
00:09:24,890 --> 00:09:26,440
I'll be consumed by it.

137
00:09:32,150 --> 00:09:33,370
You mean…

138
00:09:36,070 --> 00:09:37,150
Tomorrow night…

139
00:09:43,310 --> 00:09:44,430
Are you worried

140
00:09:45,150 --> 00:09:46,810
you may lose control again?

141
00:09:48,790 --> 00:09:50,350
On that blood moon,

142
00:09:52,460 --> 00:09:54,520
malicious energy took control of me,

143
00:09:55,340 --> 00:09:56,940
and I lost consciousness.

144
00:09:58,610 --> 00:10:00,140
In a trance,

145
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:06,300
I killed many people from the Demon Hunting Bureau.

146
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:14,130
Logically speaking,

147
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:16,770
the blood moon would last the whole night.

148
00:10:17,380 --> 00:10:18,550
But somehow,

149
00:10:19,580 --> 00:10:20,630
that night,

150
00:10:21,470 --> 00:10:23,560
I regained my sanity very soon.

151
00:10:24,430 --> 00:10:25,360
When I woke up,

152
00:10:26,110 --> 00:10:27,860
I was already inside the White Emperor Tower.

153
00:10:27,860 --> 00:10:31,090
[The Wilderness]

154
00:10:35,180 --> 00:10:36,980
I never understood the reason.

155
00:10:39,750 --> 00:10:41,150
Now that I think about it,

156
00:10:41,630 --> 00:10:43,220
your master, Zhao Wan'er,

157
00:10:43,880 --> 00:10:45,360
must have sent half of the Baize Token

158
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:46,910
into my body

159
00:10:47,740 --> 00:10:50,600
to suppress the uncontrollable malicious energy.

160
00:10:51,870 --> 00:10:53,150
Otherwise,

161
00:10:55,060 --> 00:10:57,720
the consequences would've been unimaginable.

162
00:10:58,610 --> 00:11:00,410
You went through so much trouble

163
00:11:00,550 --> 00:11:02,810
to help me find the Baize Token

164
00:11:03,590 --> 00:11:04,630
just to...

165
00:11:04,830 --> 00:11:05,850
To end my life.

166
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:13,390
My wish can be fulfilled,

167
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:16,900
and you can rid the world of a great demon.

168
00:11:23,750 --> 00:11:26,010
Do you know why your master, Zhao Wan'er,

169
00:11:26,700 --> 00:11:28,780
gave her brother's name

170
00:11:29,270 --> 00:11:30,230
to me?

171
00:11:32,630 --> 00:11:33,590
No.

172
00:11:38,020 --> 00:11:39,860
I asked her that question.

173
00:11:40,940 --> 00:11:42,470
She told me…

174
00:11:46,110 --> 00:11:47,970
it's because I was like a prisoner

175
00:11:49,030 --> 00:11:50,290
in a sea of bitterness.

176
00:11:52,190 --> 00:11:52,990
Death

177
00:11:55,100 --> 00:11:57,680
is my only escape.

178
00:12:03,430 --> 00:12:05,290
If I lose control again tomorrow,

179
00:12:08,670 --> 00:12:10,900
you must kill me with the Baize Token.

180
00:12:50,830 --> 00:12:51,750
Boys,

181
00:12:52,510 --> 00:12:53,710
wait a little longer.

182
00:12:55,100 --> 00:12:57,790
It's about time to hunt.

183
00:13:02,550 --> 00:13:03,910
If…

184
00:13:05,030 --> 00:13:06,960
the Baize Token stays in your body,

185
00:13:08,790 --> 00:13:11,310
you won't be consumed by malicious energy

186
00:13:13,110 --> 00:13:14,640
and lose control, will you?

187
00:13:15,950 --> 00:13:16,750
No.

188
00:13:18,860 --> 00:13:21,460
But to activate the Constellation Formation,

189
00:13:22,870 --> 00:13:25,470
the Baize Token must be merged outside my body.

190
00:13:27,430 --> 00:13:29,630
The formation will be finished by noon.

191
00:13:31,300 --> 00:13:32,310
After that,

192
00:13:32,430 --> 00:13:34,630
can't we divide the Baize Token into two

193
00:13:34,670 --> 00:13:37,150
and send a half back into your body?

194
00:13:44,390 --> 00:13:46,720
It's better than letting you lose control

195
00:13:46,830 --> 00:13:48,290
and start a killing spree.

196
00:13:53,430 --> 00:13:54,480
You can actually…

197
00:13:56,930 --> 00:13:58,410
sympathize with a demon?

198
00:13:59,370 --> 00:14:01,110
Demons are born aggressive.

199
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:03,640
That's why they need to be disciplined.

200
00:14:04,740 --> 00:14:06,800
Demons wish to be accepted by humans.

201
00:14:07,590 --> 00:14:09,250
We also wish

202
00:14:09,350 --> 00:14:10,750
demons wouldn't hurt us.

203
00:14:11,630 --> 00:14:14,190
But there are always demons disguised as humans

204
00:14:14,190 --> 00:14:16,050
causing chaos in the mortal world

205
00:14:16,830 --> 00:14:18,150
and spreading fear.

206
00:14:27,840 --> 00:14:30,640
You always say you can't hate the Wilderness more,

207
00:14:31,160 --> 00:14:32,260
but actually,

208
00:14:33,270 --> 00:14:35,130
you love it more than anyone else,

209
00:14:36,550 --> 00:14:37,510
don't you?

210
00:14:43,730 --> 00:14:44,410
I…

211
00:14:51,160 --> 00:14:52,170
What's wrong?

212
00:14:55,320 --> 00:14:56,980
It's happened a lot recently.

213
00:14:57,630 --> 00:14:58,960
It's not the first time.

214
00:15:00,270 --> 00:15:01,530
What's wrong with you?

215
00:15:02,180 --> 00:15:04,910
It's all because of the contract you made me sign.

216
00:15:06,590 --> 00:15:08,120
Which term did you violate?

217
00:15:10,870 --> 00:15:12,220
The one that says

218
00:15:12,550 --> 00:15:14,280
I shall stay with you willingly

219
00:15:15,230 --> 00:15:16,630
as your colleague.

220
00:15:24,050 --> 00:15:25,860
You broke the contract.

221
00:15:26,660 --> 00:15:27,990
You deserve the pain.

222
00:15:30,830 --> 00:15:32,270
You're so cruel.

223
00:15:37,950 --> 00:15:38,830
No way.

224
00:15:38,830 --> 00:15:39,670
I'm pretty and kind,

225
00:15:39,670 --> 00:15:40,190
okay?

226
00:15:41,190 --> 00:15:42,590
Since you're so pitiful,

227
00:15:42,590 --> 00:15:44,330
I'll teach you a spell

228
00:15:44,370 --> 00:15:46,050
to relieve your pain.

229
00:15:47,560 --> 00:15:48,920
There's such a spell?

230
00:15:49,350 --> 00:15:49,870
Yes.

231
00:15:50,210 --> 00:15:51,940
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

232
00:15:54,300 --> 00:15:55,760
Form is indeed emptiness,

233
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:57,650
emptiness indeed form.

234
00:16:02,110 --> 00:16:03,570
It's from the Heart Sutra.

235
00:16:03,630 --> 00:16:05,010
Recite it now and then.

236
00:16:05,670 --> 00:16:06,270
Clear the bad ideas

237
00:16:06,270 --> 00:16:07,550
from your mind.

238
00:16:13,310 --> 00:16:14,470
Look at Zhuo

239
00:16:14,470 --> 00:16:15,310
and then you.

240
00:16:15,990 --> 00:16:17,390
You're not in his league.

241
00:16:18,860 --> 00:16:20,690
Zhuo is like your brother.

242
00:16:20,760 --> 00:16:22,290
Of course we're different.

243
00:16:23,230 --> 00:16:25,990
You assume that Zhuo is like a brother to me.

244
00:16:25,990 --> 00:16:27,450
I don't think he'll agree.

245
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:29,920
What else could he be?

246
00:16:30,790 --> 00:16:31,790
Who knows?

247
00:16:32,040 --> 00:16:34,190
After all, Zhuo is so handsome

248
00:16:34,390 --> 00:16:37,390
that he's the dreamboat of countless girls in Tiandu.

249
00:16:37,670 --> 00:16:39,620
And he and I grew up together.

250
00:16:41,840 --> 00:16:42,640
Listen.

251
00:16:48,550 --> 00:16:49,510
What?

252
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:54,150
The sound of jealousy.

253
00:17:17,589 --> 00:17:19,190
I know I can't persuade you,

254
00:17:20,150 --> 00:17:21,430
but I believe

255
00:17:21,880 --> 00:17:22,960
that one day

256
00:17:22,990 --> 00:17:25,720
you'll meet the person who makes you want to live.

267
00:18:44,630 --> 00:18:46,560
Ms. Pei, you're really something.

268
00:18:47,370 --> 00:18:49,230
You actually found me here.

269
00:18:54,360 --> 00:18:55,660
Jiu.

270
00:19:00,580 --> 00:19:02,620
Mr. Zhuo, you're so diligent.

271
00:19:03,270 --> 00:19:04,860
At this hour, instead of sleeping,

272
00:19:04,860 --> 00:19:06,910
you're secretly practicing swordsmanship.

273
00:19:06,910 --> 00:19:08,110
The sooner I learn it,

274
00:19:09,190 --> 00:19:10,520
the sooner I can kill you

275
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:13,070
to fulfill your wish.

276
00:19:13,680 --> 00:19:15,200
It's a win-win.

277
00:19:15,830 --> 00:19:17,690
Of course I need to practice hard.

278
00:19:18,610 --> 00:19:20,140
Practice makes perfect,

279
00:19:20,550 --> 00:19:22,090
but if you do it wrongly

280
00:19:22,290 --> 00:19:23,750
and get ahead of yourself,

281
00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:25,600
you'll hurt yourself.

282
00:19:28,610 --> 00:19:29,870
None of your business.

283
00:19:30,430 --> 00:19:31,550
I taught you this.

284
00:19:32,180 --> 00:19:33,710
Of course it's my business.

285
00:20:46,740 --> 00:20:47,580
Who is he?

286
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,330
Your ancestor,

287
00:20:49,710 --> 00:20:50,430
Bingyi,

288
00:20:51,010 --> 00:20:53,340
the first master of the Cloud Light Sword.

289
00:20:57,080 --> 00:20:58,560
The sword technique just now...

290
00:20:58,560 --> 00:21:00,670
Was the very one Bingyi used

291
00:21:00,700 --> 00:21:01,980
to slay Ying Long.

292
00:21:03,680 --> 00:21:04,800
Can it kill you?

293
00:21:06,270 --> 00:21:08,330
Ying Long was much stronger than I am.

294
00:21:08,530 --> 00:21:10,190
He was an ancient great demon.

295
00:21:10,340 --> 00:21:11,800
If it could kill Ying Long,

296
00:21:11,800 --> 00:21:13,560
so of course, it could kill me too.

297
00:21:13,560 --> 00:21:15,360
Take your time to understand it.

298
00:21:17,820 --> 00:21:19,150
Why are you teaching me?

299
00:21:20,050 --> 00:21:21,510
Didn't I already tell you?

300
00:21:21,750 --> 00:21:23,030
I want you to kill me.

301
00:21:24,190 --> 00:21:25,350
You're lying.

302
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:27,560
I'm not.

303
00:21:27,590 --> 00:21:28,950
When you made the oath with me

304
00:21:28,950 --> 00:21:30,430
in the dungeon back then,

305
00:21:30,530 --> 00:21:31,930
you truly weren't lying.

306
00:21:34,790 --> 00:21:37,660
I'll teach you the true way to use the Cloud Light Sword.

307
00:21:37,660 --> 00:21:38,670
Then...

308
00:21:38,770 --> 00:21:40,320
Kill me.

309
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:42,940
Back then, you were consumed

310
00:21:42,940 --> 00:21:44,070
by a desire for death,

311
00:21:44,070 --> 00:21:45,870
and your eyes were void of light.

312
00:21:46,670 --> 00:21:47,760
But now,

313
00:21:48,450 --> 00:21:49,570
I can see that

314
00:21:49,780 --> 00:21:51,180
you no longer wish to die.

315
00:21:56,600 --> 00:21:58,090
Is it because of Wen Xiao?

316
00:22:02,970 --> 00:22:04,830
I've always found the Wilderness

317
00:22:04,830 --> 00:22:06,340
to be cold and lifeless.

318
00:22:06,680 --> 00:22:09,010
Living for a thousand years has been dull.

319
00:22:09,630 --> 00:22:12,320
But after wandering the mortal world a few times,

320
00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:14,300
I found that mortal hearts

321
00:22:14,510 --> 00:22:15,710
have their own charm.

322
00:22:16,110 --> 00:22:17,840
So, for now, I don't want to die.

323
00:22:18,470 --> 00:22:19,330
Zhao Yuanzhou,

324
00:22:19,870 --> 00:22:20,970
trust me.

325
00:22:21,300 --> 00:22:22,380
The further you go,

326
00:22:22,540 --> 00:22:24,070
the less you'll want to die.

327
00:22:24,680 --> 00:22:26,740
No matter how well you treat Wen Xiao,

328
00:22:26,870 --> 00:22:28,670
I've already sworn a deadly oath

329
00:22:29,350 --> 00:22:30,510
that one day,

330
00:22:31,590 --> 00:22:33,510
I will kill you with my sword.

331
00:22:35,350 --> 00:22:38,210
If I truly grasp the essence of the Cloud Light Sword

332
00:22:38,950 --> 00:22:41,280
and master the technique in the illusion,

333
00:22:42,560 --> 00:22:43,760
won't you regret it?

334
00:22:49,310 --> 00:22:50,270
No, I won't.

335
00:22:53,710 --> 00:22:54,840
I don't understand.

336
00:22:55,230 --> 00:22:56,200
Why?

337
00:22:57,300 --> 00:22:59,030
Since you no longer want to die,

338
00:22:59,620 --> 00:23:01,280
why are you still teaching me?

339

come with me to stand guard outside,

so Wen Xiao and the others can focus on their spellcasting.

390

No problem.

It's noon now.

392
00:25:15,060 --> 00:25:17,230
Once the formation begins,

393
00:25:17,250 --> 00:25:18,710
it cannot be interrupted.

394
00:25:19,030 --> 00:25:20,060
Are you

395
00:25:20,310 --> 00:25:21,990
all prepared?

396
00:25:27,840 --> 00:25:28,860
Yes.

397
00:26:20,710 --> 00:26:22,910
Finally.

398
00:26:34,270 --> 00:26:35,260
Zhu Yin,

399
00:26:36,260 --> 00:26:37,460
start the formation!

400
00:26:38,870 --> 00:26:40,730
The stars align

401
00:26:40,990 --> 00:26:42,820
to stabilize the universe.

402
00:26:43,110 --> 00:26:43,830

403
00:26:57,410 --> 00:26:59,020
All sources converge.

404
00:27:00,100 --> 00:27:02,200
Yin and Yang reflect each other,

405
00:27:02,390 --> 00:27:04,450
and heaven and earth work in harmony.

406
00:27:05,150 --> 00:27:05,950

407
00:27:06,750 --> 00:27:07,670

409
00:28:50,560 --> 00:28:51,300
Zhu Yin,

410
00:28:51,330 --> 00:28:51,930
you...

411
00:28:53,100 --> 00:28:54,020
Zhu Yin,

412
00:28:55,030 --> 00:28:57,360
I knew there was something wrong with you.

413
00:29:03,370 --> 00:29:06,830
The Star Formation requires two Mountain Gods to complete it.

414
00:29:07,150 --> 00:29:08,080
Ying Zhao,

415
00:29:08,490 --> 00:29:10,320
it's useless for you to hold on alone.

416
00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:12,580
Stop dreaming of saving the Wilderness.

417
00:29:51,390 --> 00:29:52,520
It's you?

418
00:29:52,750 --> 00:29:53,830
Mr. Zhuo,

419
00:29:54,070 --> 00:29:55,320
we meet again.

420
00:30:10,460 --> 00:30:11,790
No, something's wrong.

421
00:30:12,210 --> 00:30:13,310
They are not humans

422
00:30:15,860 --> 00:30:17,060
nor demons.

423
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:19,040
They are...

424
00:30:20,750 --> 00:30:21,550
They are...

425
00:30:26,950 --> 00:30:27,670
Ying Lei.

426
00:30:28,750 --> 00:30:29,880
Fall back behind me.

427
00:31:26,220 --> 00:31:27,340
Fish scales?

428
00:31:28,150 --> 00:31:29,490
That's Henggong fish from the Wilderness!

429
00:31:29,490 --> 00:31:30,860
Henggong fish?

430
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:40,260
The scales of Ran Yi are incredibly rare.

431
00:31:40,630 --> 00:31:41,790
Here, take these.

432
00:31:42,270 --> 00:31:43,350
Maybe later,

433
00:31:43,700 --> 00:31:45,900
when you develop a new divine medicine,

434
00:31:46,670 --> 00:31:47,730
they'll be useful.

435
00:31:55,210 --> 00:31:56,390
These scales

436
00:31:56,990 --> 00:31:58,270
are so hard and sharp.

437
00:32:00,920 --> 00:32:03,250
They could even be used as hidden weapons.

438
00:32:03,360 --> 00:32:04,980
There's something more powerful.

439
00:32:04,980 --> 00:32:05,670
Good stuff.

440
00:32:05,700 --> 00:32:07,970
I once saw a monster in the Wilderness

441
00:32:08,030 --> 00:32:09,670
called Henggong fish.

442
00:32:09,950 --> 00:32:11,830
Its scales are as hard as steel,

443
00:32:11,890 --> 00:32:13,350
impervious to blades and spears.

444
00:32:13,350 --> 00:32:14,270
Sounds like

445
00:32:14,430 --> 00:32:16,160
it would make excellent armor.

446
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:50,230
Its whole body is red,

447
00:32:50,340 --> 00:32:52,330
and its roar can shatter mountains and stone.

448
00:32:52,330 --> 00:32:53,400
Could it be...

449
00:32:53,620 --> 00:32:54,390
Zheng?

450
00:32:57,610 --> 00:32:59,030
What you're describing

451
00:32:59,320 --> 00:33:01,450
are all monsters from the Wilderness.

452
00:33:01,750 --> 00:33:03,160
But they are human.

453
00:33:03,180 --> 00:33:03,950
Are you insane?

454
00:33:03,950 --> 00:33:05,350
How could these be human?

455
00:33:13,790 --> 00:33:14,770
Zhu Yin,

456
00:33:15,400 --> 00:33:17,030
why are you doing this?

457
00:33:18,800 --> 00:33:20,170
Because he and I

458
00:33:20,190 --> 00:33:21,850
share the same goal.

459
00:33:27,420 --> 00:33:28,490
Ying Zhao,

460
00:33:28,820 --> 00:33:30,440
long time no see.

461
00:33:55,350 --> 00:33:57,620
These despicable tricks again.

462
00:33:58,690 --> 00:34:01,310
The number of times you can possess others is limited.

463
00:34:01,310 --> 00:34:02,330
Li Lun,

464
00:34:02,630 --> 00:34:05,710
you use forbidden arts so recklessly.

465
00:34:05,990 --> 00:34:07,670

466
00:34:07,870 --> 00:34:09,450

467
00:34:23,469 --> 00:34:24,270
Zhu Yin,

468
00:34:25,310 --> 00:34:27,040
you, a dignified Mountain God,

469
00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:31,420
have fallen so low as to conspire with Li Lun, like a pack of wolves.

470
00:34:32,389 --> 00:34:34,260
A pack of wolves?

471
00:34:36,510 --> 00:34:38,469
Now, you even use us demons

472
00:34:38,780 --> 00:34:40,659
as comparisons in insults.

473
00:34:41,070 --> 00:34:42,150
Good for you,

474
00:34:42,150 --> 00:34:43,010
Zhao Yuanzhou.

477

478
00:34:49,230 --> 00:34:50,830
you're the notorious great demon Zhu Yan,

479
00:34:50,830 --> 00:34:51,630
haven't you?

480
00:34:53,239 --> 00:34:54,989
Your goal is to

bring ruin to the Wilderness

482
00:34:57,980 --> 00:35:00,510
and lead all demons to their deaths, isn't it?

483
00:35:01,449 --> 00:35:02,820
You're wrong.

484
00:35:03,270 --> 00:35:05,740
It's to allow all living beings in the Wilderness

485
00:35:05,740 --> 00:35:08,030
to freely travel between the two worlds,

00:36:34,130 --> 00:36:37,950
♫Rock and moss♫

519
00:36:34,670 --> 00:36:35,940
People say

520
00:36:36,070 --> 00:36:37,340
the Torch Dragon has great powers.

521
00:36:37,340 --> 00:36:38,350
It controls celestial phenomena

522
00:36:38,350 --> 00:36:39,620
and can move mountains and rivers with its breath.

523
00:36:38,720 --> 00:36:39,840
♫Are watching♫

524
00:36:39,900 --> 00:36:42,920
♫A lone boat drifts through the vast world, vanishing into mist♫

525
00:36:40,020 --> 00:36:41,210
Little scholar,

526
00:36:42,080 --> 00:36:43,330
while he may be powerful,

527
00:36:42,970 --> 00:36:45,960
♫Its sound fading away♫

528
00:36:43,360 --> 00:36:44,290
he can't control

529
00:36:44,300 --> 00:36:45,870
whether or not

530
00:36:45,920 --> 00:36:48,310
you achieve top honors in the imperial examination.

531
00:36:47,200 --> 00:36:48,050
♫I wish♫

532
00:36:48,130 --> 00:36:51,250
♫The sorrow of parting stayed beyond the river, and that we did not share the same mountain and moon♫

533
00:36:48,390 --> 00:36:50,150
I didn't ask Lord Torch Dragon

534
00:36:50,150 --> 00:36:51,650
to make me a Number One Scholar.

535
00:36:51,300 --> 00:36:55,120
♫Deep love, yet fate runs shallow♫

536
00:36:51,870 --> 00:36:53,070
Reading the classics

537
00:36:53,070 --> 00:36:55,170
is to broaden my horizons

538
00:36:55,200 --> 00:36:57,070
and avoid being narrow-minded or self-restrained.

539
00:36:57,070 --> 00:36:58,750
You're here as the temple keeper,

540
00:36:58,750 --> 00:36:59,880
trapped in one place

541
00:36:59,910 --> 00:37:01,110
day after day.

542
00:37:01,190 --> 00:37:02,850
You may not quite understand.

543
00:37:02,910 --> 00:37:03,750
You should

544
00:37:03,780 --> 00:37:05,430
go down the mountain more often.

545
00:37:05,430 --> 00:37:06,630
If you don't understand,

546
00:37:06,630 --> 00:37:08,040
you're welcome to visit me anytime.

547
00:37:08,040 --> 00:37:09,870
I live right at the foot of the mountain,

548
00:37:09,870 --> 00:37:12,470
in the house under the big tree on the west side.

549
00:37:24,470 --> 00:37:26,670
What did Li Lun offer you?

550
00:37:27,590 --> 00:37:29,190
There's no need for an offer.

551
00:37:30,760 --> 00:37:32,760
He and I share the same goal.

552
00:37:34,140 --> 00:37:35,800
Demons are demons.

553
00:37:37,150 --> 00:37:39,960
We will never be accepted by mortals.

554
00:37:41,600 --> 00:37:43,530
What did you add in the tea?

555
00:37:43,990 --> 00:37:45,710
Why did you harm me?

556
00:37:57,910 --> 00:37:59,120
Didn't you say

557
00:37:59,230 --> 00:38:00,290
that studying

558
00:38:00,350 --> 00:38:02,940
is to understand human affairs,

559
00:38:03,040 --> 00:38:04,320
broaden horizons,

560
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:06,660
and recognize the vastness of the world,

561
00:38:06,680 --> 00:38:08,940
avoiding narrow-mindedness and self-restriction?

562
00:38:08,940 --> 00:38:10,550
But you're a demon.

563
00:38:19,590 --> 00:38:21,900
Why do you want recognition from them?

564
00:38:24,490 --> 00:38:26,210
Baize Goddess

565
00:38:26,730 --> 00:38:28,390
is just a mortal.

566
00:38:29,200 --> 00:38:32,110
On what basis can she set the rules for demons?

567
00:38:34,170 --> 00:38:35,330
Li Lun,

568
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:38,310
many demons yearn for the mortal world,

569
00:38:39,070 --> 00:38:41,060
but there are also many

570
00:38:41,200 --> 00:38:44,030
who prefer the eternal tranquility of the Wilderness,

571
00:38:44,030 --> 00:38:45,890
living in harmony with the world.

572
00:38:46,630 --> 00:38:48,970
So on what basis can you decide for them

573
00:38:49,960 --> 00:38:51,870
and destroy their homeland?

574
00:38:51,950 --> 00:38:54,560
That's because they are timid and cowardly,

575
00:38:55,080 --> 00:38:57,140
afraid to step into the mortal world.

576
00:38:58,840 --> 00:38:59,900
Zhu Yan,

577
00:39:01,570 --> 00:39:02,750
don't forget.

578
00:39:04,320 --> 00:39:07,660
It was you who led me out of the Wilderness,

579
00:39:10,430 --> 00:39:13,910
allowing me to see the vast world.
