00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:27,350
♫Sorrows scattered, lost to the wind♫

177
00:15:28,520 --> 00:15:32,440
♫Not forgetting, nor dwelling on♫

178
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:35,630
♫The way back home♫

179
00:15:36,330 --> 00:15:37,950

180
00:15:38,340 --> 00:15:41,850

♫Turning back♫

183

♫I find you still in that familiar place♫

184
00:15:51,090 --> 00:15:52,740
♫Waiting there♫

185
00:16:25,750 --> 00:16:26,310
Oh my.

186
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:28,720
A gift from Mr. Zhuo?

187
00:16:29,630 --> 00:16:31,360
The sun has risen from the west.

188
00:16:31,870 --> 00:16:34,110
And it's such a beautiful jade pendant.

189
00:16:35,190 --> 00:16:36,650
I don't like to owe favors.

190
00:16:36,890 --> 00:16:37,560
Oh?

191
00:16:39,020 --> 00:16:40,880
Which favor are you referring to?

192
00:16:41,030 --> 00:16:43,580
When I told you about Cheng Huang's formation,

193
00:16:43,580 --> 00:16:46,320
or when I taught you how to freeze water into ice?

194
00:16:46,340 --> 00:16:47,580
Perhaps,

195
00:16:47,630 --> 00:16:50,830
for when I taught you how to materialize your sword forms?

196
00:16:51,520 --> 00:16:53,680
You mortals have a saying.

197
00:16:54,150 --> 00:16:55,350
The closer you are,

198
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:56,870
the more you must settle the score.

199
00:16:56,870 --> 00:16:58,530
Don't push your luck.

200
00:17:01,480 --> 00:17:02,860
I will still kill you.

201
00:17:03,550 --> 00:17:04,590
I can't wait.

202
00:17:06,690 --> 00:17:08,880
Please keep your promise, Mr. Zhuo.

203
00:17:33,349 --> 00:17:34,390
Left, right.

204
00:17:34,410 --> 00:17:35,450
Left, right.

205
00:17:35,480 --> 00:17:36,359
Left, right.

206
00:17:36,430 --> 00:17:37,510
Left, right.

207
00:17:38,580 --> 00:17:39,500
Sister.

208
00:17:39,750 --> 00:17:40,710
Hush.

209
00:17:41,080 --> 00:17:42,570
Don't say that word.

210
00:17:43,700 --> 00:17:44,500
Which word?

211
00:17:45,220 --> 00:17:46,790
I only said one word.

212
00:17:46,900 --> 00:17:47,590
Oh.

213
00:17:47,610 --> 00:17:48,420
Sister.

214
00:17:57,930 --> 00:17:59,980
According to the report,

215
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:01,540
three months ago...

216
00:18:01,560 --> 00:18:02,970
Three months ago,

217
00:18:04,170 --> 00:18:06,320
an identical case happened.

218
00:18:06,790 --> 00:18:08,410
The same method,

219
00:18:09,030 --> 00:18:10,970
and the same deer antler symbol.

220
00:18:11,350 --> 00:18:12,500
And the murderer

221
00:18:14,430 --> 00:18:16,330
was my brother, Pei Siheng.

222
00:18:16,420 --> 00:18:18,420
When you were on your demon-hunting mission,

223
00:18:18,420 --> 00:18:20,750
you shot and killed Pei Siheng on the spot.

224
00:18:21,750 --> 00:18:22,770
After that,

225
00:18:23,230 --> 00:18:25,630
you resigned as commander of Chongwu Camp.

226
00:18:25,650 --> 00:18:27,160
Why did you kill your brother?

227
00:18:27,160 --> 00:18:28,500
You could have just arrested him

228
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:30,830
and sentenced him according to his crime.

229
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:34,470
Because he became a demon.

230
00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:36,810
How could a human have become a demon?

231
00:18:36,810 --> 00:18:38,630
So what if he became a demon?

232
00:18:38,790 --> 00:18:40,590
Not all demons should be killed.

233
00:18:41,080 --> 00:18:42,480
How does that make sense?

234
00:18:57,870 --> 00:18:58,760
Sister.

235
00:19:07,540 --> 00:19:09,260
Are you here to kill me?

236
00:19:10,220 --> 00:19:11,650
You're evil.

237
00:19:12,750 --> 00:19:14,150
You are unforgivable.

238
00:19:15,180 --> 00:19:17,160
I'm indeed guilty.

239
00:19:17,310 --> 00:19:18,440
It's unforgivable.

240
00:19:19,270 --> 00:19:20,340
But Sister,

241
00:19:21,720 --> 00:19:23,270
can you forgive me?

242
00:19:24,710 --> 00:19:26,570
You must be able to understand me.

243
00:19:29,230 --> 00:19:31,070
Ms. Pei, if you can't do it,

244
00:19:31,230 --> 00:19:33,100
we'll kill him instead.

245
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:35,630
Sister.

246
00:19:36,110 --> 00:19:37,300
Back then,

247
00:19:37,320 --> 00:19:38,380
I just wanted to...

248
00:20:12,740 --> 00:20:13,230
Bro...

249
00:20:13,670 --> 00:20:14,340
Brother.

250
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:15,680
Sister.

251
00:20:18,150 --> 00:20:20,680
Back then, you turned and left just like that.

252
00:20:24,100 --> 00:20:25,620
You didn't hear

253
00:20:27,780 --> 00:20:29,510
my last words for you.

254
00:20:42,590 --> 00:20:43,390
Sister.

255
00:20:44,890 --> 00:20:46,360
Now that I'm dead,

256
00:20:47,540 --> 00:20:50,100
I can't do anything for you anymore.

257
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:58,780
This case is so strange.

258
00:20:58,810 --> 00:21:00,600
Have you ever suspected it?

259
00:21:01,030 --> 00:21:02,150
Of course.

260
00:21:09,160 --> 00:21:11,020
We examined the body three times.

261
00:21:11,870 --> 00:21:13,530
He was confirmed to be a demon.

262
00:21:14,760 --> 00:21:16,220
No other result was found.

263
00:21:16,840 --> 00:21:18,750
What did you do with the body?

264
00:21:20,580 --> 00:21:21,710
I followed the rules

265
00:21:22,750 --> 00:21:23,550
and burned it.

266
00:21:29,160 --> 00:21:31,990
What about your brother we saw today?

267
00:21:32,850 --> 00:21:34,360
Did he come back alive?

268
00:21:36,540 --> 00:21:37,740
He came back to life?

269
00:21:39,880 --> 00:21:42,540
I don't believe there is such magic in the world.

270
00:21:43,580 --> 00:21:45,830
He wasn't suddenly resurrected today.

271
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:49,750
The one who sent this case file

272
00:21:51,290 --> 00:21:53,090
was my brother.

273
00:22:04,360 --> 00:22:06,320
Why did he give you this file?

274
00:22:09,150 --> 00:22:10,950
He must have been wronged.

275
00:22:11,790 --> 00:22:14,140
He wants you to clear his name.

276
00:22:15,480 --> 00:22:16,290
No.

277
00:22:18,230 --> 00:22:20,370
His gaze wanted me to know that

278
00:22:21,940 --> 00:22:22,850
he hates me

279
00:22:24,590 --> 00:22:25,840
and wants to kill me.

280
00:22:26,850 --> 00:22:28,400
He wants me to suffer.

281
00:22:30,410 --> 00:22:31,400
That's wrong.

282
00:22:32,620 --> 00:22:33,750
I smell

283
00:22:34,360 --> 00:22:35,710
a conspiracy.

284
00:22:38,100 --> 00:22:40,600
He has a huge connection with Cheng Huang.

285
00:22:41,020 --> 00:22:42,280
If we find Cheng Huang,

286
00:22:42,760 --> 00:22:43,890
there will be clues.

287
00:22:44,800 --> 00:22:46,200
Why are you looking at me?

288
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:48,540
How would I know where Cheng Huang is?

289
00:22:48,840 --> 00:22:50,570
When we were looking for Ran Yi,

290
00:22:50,910 --> 00:22:52,240
you said the same thing.

291
00:22:56,360 --> 00:22:59,060
It's so hard to fool you now, Mr. Zhuo.

292
00:23:04,830 --> 00:23:06,420
Cheng Huang's formation

293
00:23:04,940 --> 00:23:09,750
[Pear Garden] [Ming Palace]

294
00:23:06,440 --> 00:23:08,020
uses living people as a medium

295
00:23:08,020 --> 00:23:09,650
to absorb the power of life.

296
00:23:09,950 --> 00:23:12,510
And the place where the power ultimately gathers

297
00:23:12,510 --> 00:23:13,840
is the eye of formation.

298
00:23:16,620 --> 00:23:17,750
Cheng Huang is here.

299
00:23:18,270 --> 00:23:20,280
[Map of Tiandu]

300
00:23:20,670 --> 00:23:21,950
The observatory?

301
00:23:30,220 --> 00:23:32,080
When the Baize Token went missing

302
00:23:32,270 --> 00:23:34,070
and the goddess' seat was empty,

303
00:23:34,190 --> 00:23:36,720
the one who forcefully opened the Kunlun Gate

304
00:23:36,940 --> 00:23:40,100
and caused the demons to escape to the mortal world

305
00:23:42,790 --> 00:23:44,230
was Cheng Huang.

306
00:23:53,130 --> 00:23:55,770
Cheng Huang committed a grave crime back then

307
00:23:56,270 --> 00:23:58,930
and killed countless demons of the Wilderness.

308
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:05,280
But somehow, he escaped the punishment of the Baize Token

309
00:24:05,350 --> 00:24:06,950
and fled to the mortal world.

310
00:24:08,150 --> 00:24:10,010
I don't know what he is

311
00:24:10,620 --> 00:24:12,810
plotting in secret.

312
00:24:51,270 --> 00:24:52,000
It's so high.

313
00:24:57,040 --> 00:24:58,840
This sundial looks familiar.

314
00:25:01,270 --> 00:25:03,400
Something's wrong with this sundial.

315
00:25:03,640 --> 00:25:05,240
It's not for measuring time.

316
00:25:05,900 --> 00:25:06,660
What?

317
00:25:07,630 --> 00:25:09,760
The sundial can be used to measure time,

318
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:12,430
but it can only do so when there is sunlight.

319
00:25:12,540 --> 00:25:14,270
If it's used for measuring time at night,

320
00:25:14,270 --> 00:25:16,200
it'll need the help of a water bell.

321
00:25:16,770 --> 00:25:18,500
But there's only a sundial here

322
00:25:18,730 --> 00:25:20,260
and no water bell.

323
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:23,310
Then this sundial is...

324
00:25:23,310 --> 00:25:24,350
It's an entrance.

325
00:25:24,810 --> 00:25:26,780
Cheng Huang is guarding the eye of the formation.

326
00:25:26,780 --> 00:25:27,810
This sundial

327
00:25:27,850 --> 00:25:30,380
is used to connect to the eye of the formation.

328
00:25:33,430 --> 00:25:34,760
We can't barge in.

329
00:25:40,900 --> 00:25:43,300
Cheng Huang has lived for too long.

330
00:25:43,380 --> 00:25:44,270
He has a weird temper

331
00:25:44,270 --> 00:25:45,640
and a lot of malicious energy.

332
00:25:45,640 --> 00:25:47,590
It's hard for us to defend ourselves

333
00:25:47,590 --> 00:25:48,950
in his territory.

334
00:25:48,970 --> 00:25:50,350
Stop showing off your knowledge.

335
00:25:50,350 --> 00:25:51,430
Tell us what to do.

336
00:25:53,220 --> 00:25:56,350
Don't you love helping others tie the knot, Ms. Wen Xiao?

337
00:25:57,070 --> 00:25:59,030
Please tie a knot for us.

338
00:25:59,060 --> 00:26:00,480
For the two of us?

339
00:26:02,590 --> 00:26:03,380
Ridiculous.

340
00:26:03,920 --> 00:26:04,910
I mean,

341
00:26:04,940 --> 00:26:06,910
use the Demon Binding Rope to divide us into two teams

342
00:26:06,910 --> 00:26:07,840
and tie us together

343
00:26:07,840 --> 00:26:09,830
to prevent us from being separated and lost.

344
00:26:09,830 --> 00:26:11,450
Especially those

345
00:26:11,750 --> 00:26:13,220
young friends.

346
00:26:13,430 --> 00:26:16,230
-He's talking about you.
-He's talking about you.

347
00:26:34,160 --> 00:26:36,550
I really want to tie it around your neck instead.

348
00:26:36,550 --> 00:26:37,760
I'm sorry.

349
00:26:37,790 --> 00:26:39,100
I'm not a dog demon.

350
00:26:39,560 --> 00:26:41,310
I like walking monkeys anyway.

351
00:26:46,840 --> 00:26:47,810
Yinglei.

352
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:48,920
You stay here

353
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:50,260
and don't let anyone come close.

354
00:26:50,260 --> 00:26:51,130
Huh?

355
00:27:08,800 --> 00:27:09,840
Wow.

356
00:27:14,780 --> 00:27:15,350
Eh?

357
00:27:15,370 --> 00:27:16,770
They left just like that?

358
00:27:17,860 --> 00:27:18,660
Bai Jiu.

359
00:27:18,780 --> 00:27:19,580
Then...

360
00:27:26,740 --> 00:27:27,690
Then I...

361
00:27:28,790 --> 00:27:30,450
How should I guard this place?

362
00:28:14,330 --> 00:28:15,760
Jiu.

363
00:28:17,930 --> 00:28:18,740
Sister Pei.

364
00:28:19,230 --> 00:28:20,270
Where is this place, Sister Pei?

365
00:28:20,270 --> 00:28:20,930
Sister Pei.

366
00:28:23,790 --> 00:28:24,580
Sister Pei?

367
00:28:25,300 --> 00:28:26,030
Sister Pei?

368
00:28:26,900 --> 00:28:28,160
Where is this?

369
00:28:29,320 --> 00:28:30,690
Sister Pei.

370
00:28:30,930 --> 00:28:32,390
What's wrong, Sister Pei?

371
00:28:32,560 --> 00:28:33,560
Sister Pei.

372
00:28:54,390 --> 00:28:55,500
Heng.

373
00:29:59,180 --> 00:30:01,840
Why did we suddenly come to Tianxiang Pavilion?

374
00:30:03,060 --> 00:30:05,070
Turns out the ever-so-serious Mr. Zhuo

375
00:30:05,070 --> 00:30:06,820
would come to such a place too.

376
00:30:06,850 --> 00:30:07,510
You...

377
00:30:11,410 --> 00:30:13,810
I came here when I was investigating a case.

378
00:30:14,830 --> 00:30:15,900
Just once.

379
00:30:16,470 --> 00:30:17,080
Oh.

380
00:30:17,160 --> 00:30:17,770
You...

381
00:30:19,900 --> 00:30:22,270
This is not the real Tianxiang Pavilion.

382
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:25,690
It's an illusion Cheng Huang created with magic.

383
00:30:27,480 --> 00:30:28,610
I see.

384
00:30:28,950 --> 00:30:30,350
It's like Ran Yi's dream.

385
00:30:32,630 --> 00:30:34,560
It's way more dangerous than that.

386
00:30:37,670 --> 00:30:39,740
This is someone's memory.

387
00:30:41,040 --> 00:30:41,910
Whose?

388
00:30:48,210 --> 00:30:49,410
I guess it's hers.

389
00:31:14,330 --> 00:31:15,790
Let's split up.

390
00:31:27,330 --> 00:31:28,560
Whose idea was this?

391
00:31:29,460 --> 00:31:30,250
-His.
-Hers.

392
00:31:35,040 --> 00:31:36,810
Why are you complaining?

393
00:31:36,970 --> 00:31:38,460
You got two of us.

394
00:31:38,750 --> 00:31:41,650
Standing between two handsome men.

395
00:31:41,680 --> 00:31:43,410
Aren't you happy?

396
00:31:44,140 --> 00:31:46,560
You're the one standing between both of us.

397
00:31:46,930 --> 00:31:48,020
You shameless guy.

398
00:31:55,400 --> 00:31:56,430
You two have fun.

399
00:31:57,300 --> 00:31:57,750
Hey...

400
00:31:59,860 --> 00:32:01,870
One moment ago we were companions.

401
00:32:01,890 --> 00:32:04,020
The next, he's as cold as a stranger.

402
00:32:05,430 --> 00:32:07,030
You're much better than him.

403
00:32:07,960 --> 00:32:09,380
Time for a walk.

404
00:32:09,630 --> 00:32:10,160
Let's go.

405
00:32:18,760 --> 00:32:19,560
Sister.

406
00:32:22,930 --> 00:32:24,160
Why are you here?

407
00:32:24,770 --> 00:32:26,250
What are you doing here?

408
00:32:30,620 --> 00:32:32,150
You joined the Chongwu Camp

409
00:32:32,520 --> 00:32:34,070
without telling me?

410
00:32:36,590 --> 00:32:38,550
Why can't I join Chongwu Camp?

411
00:32:39,400 --> 00:32:41,760
The Pei family has been hunting demons for generations.

412
00:32:41,760 --> 00:32:43,420
I am the only son of our family.

413
00:32:43,910 --> 00:32:46,040
I should inherit the family business.

414
00:32:46,400 --> 00:32:48,310
But Father and Grandpa only value you.

415
00:32:48,310 --> 00:32:50,040
They don't care about me at all.

416
00:32:52,110 --> 00:32:54,190
They even gave you the family's treasured bow

417
00:32:54,190 --> 00:32:55,030
to you.

418
00:33:08,830 --> 00:33:09,640
Heng.

419
00:33:09,740 --> 00:33:10,790
Heng!

420
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:14,130
Don't be so willful.

421
00:33:14,990 --> 00:33:16,390
Look at your health.

422
00:33:16,970 --> 00:33:18,180
You are weak

423
00:33:18,500 --> 00:33:19,760
and feeble.

424
00:33:20,030 --> 00:33:21,220
How can you join the army?

425
00:33:21,220 --> 00:33:22,630
How can you catch demons?

426
00:33:22,860 --> 00:33:24,330
Do you want to die?

427
00:33:26,710 --> 00:33:27,350
Yes.

428
00:33:27,950 --> 00:33:29,230
You all look down on me.

429
00:33:30,870 --> 00:33:33,670
You think I can't achieve my goal because I'm sick.

430
00:33:35,060 --> 00:33:37,160
I want to prove to all of you that

431
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:39,510
I can also join the army to hunt demons!

432
00:33:39,510 --> 00:33:40,670
Don't be willful.

433
00:33:45,400 --> 00:33:46,960
I promised Father

434
00:33:47,890 --> 00:33:49,520
to take good care of you.

435
00:33:51,160 --> 00:33:52,870
I did all this

436
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:55,490
for you.

437
00:33:55,520 --> 00:33:56,030
Can you...

438
00:33:56,030 --> 00:33:56,730
For me?

439
00:34:01,700 --> 00:34:03,480
You did it for yourself.

440
00:34:09,200 --> 00:34:10,430
Since young,

441
00:34:12,950 --> 00:34:14,150
have you ever asked me

442
00:34:16,560 --> 00:34:18,110
what I want the most?

443
00:34:21,239 --> 00:34:22,040
Sister.

444
00:34:23,830 --> 00:34:25,830
Since I started to remember things,

445
00:34:27,520 --> 00:34:30,280
people around me kept saying that to me.

446
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:33,510
"For you."

447
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:36,120
"For you."

448
00:34:38,150 --> 00:34:38,989
"For you."

449
00:34:45,310 --> 00:34:46,500
This sentence

450
00:34:48,520 --> 00:34:49,620
is like a shackle

451
00:34:49,620 --> 00:34:52,230
I've been wearing since I was a kid.

Sister Pei.

494

Why did you space out for so long?

495
00:37:04,230 --> 00:37:05,890
Why is there a doll over there?

496
00:37:07,670 --> 00:37:08,730
Let's check it out.

497
00:37:27,250 --> 00:37:28,330
Sister.

498
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:33,060
Do you want to know

499
00:37:33,960 --> 00:37:35,840
why I became a demon?

500
00:37:36,210 --> 00:37:37,200
I don't know.

501
00:37:39,030 --> 00:37:41,250
You never told me.

502
00:37:42,900 --> 00:37:44,130
Sister Pei,

503
00:37:44,190 --> 00:37:45,670
are you talking to me?

504
00:37:50,080 --> 00:37:52,800
This doll looks scary.

505
00:37:53,980 --> 00:37:55,730
This doll said

506
00:37:56,810 --> 00:37:59,730
he knew why my brother became a demon.

507
00:37:59,950 --> 00:38:00,990
Was it talking?

508
00:38:01,580 --> 00:38:02,860
Why didn't I hear it?

509
00:38:29,110 --> 00:38:30,270
Sister Pei?

510
00:38:30,480 --> 00:38:31,710
Sister Pei!

511
00:38:31,950 --> 00:38:33,150
Sister Pei, where are you?

512
00:38:33,150 --> 00:38:33,930
Sister Pei.

513
00:38:35,570 --> 00:38:38,060

00:39:19,550 --> 00:39:20,510
Mr. Zhuo.

520
00:39:20,740 --> 00:39:21,870
What a coincidence.

521
00:39:52,310 --> 00:39:53,980
The dancing girl

522
00:39:54,010 --> 00:39:54,940
is missing.

523
00:39:57,470 --> 00:39:58,470
She's over there.

524
00:40:13,040 --> 00:40:15,610
She aged so much so quickly.

525
00:40:19,430 --> 00:40:20,550
Did she?

526
00:40:23,440 --> 00:40:26,120
You men don't understand at all.

527
00:40:26,480 --> 00:40:27,630
Zhi Mei missed

528
00:40:27,660 --> 00:40:29,030
her blooming window.

529
00:40:29,250 --> 00:40:31,080
She was obsessed with the stage and dance

530
00:40:31,080 --> 00:40:32,870
and couldn't find a good time to get married.

531
00:40:32,870 --> 00:40:33,790
Great.

532
00:40:33,810 --> 00:40:35,760
No one is interested in her anymore.

533
00:40:35,760 --> 00:40:36,630
Now,

534
00:40:36,650 --> 00:40:38,830
the peony is blooming beautifully.

535
00:40:38,830 --> 00:40:41,080
Spring flowers don't know how cold snow is.

536
00:40:41,080 --> 00:40:43,510
The plum blossoms don't know the heat of summer.

537
00:40:43,510 --> 00:40:45,040
Each flower has its admirer

538
00:40:45,390 --> 00:40:46,590
and its own beauty.

539
00:40:47,470 --> 00:40:49,070
Why compare with each other?

540
00:40:51,910 --> 00:40:53,430
Zhi Mei, Zhi Mei.

541
00:40:55,420 --> 00:40:59,150
She must be obsessed with the plum blossoms's pride and aloofness.

542
00:40:59,530 --> 00:41:00,930
She enjoys her own beauty

543
00:41:02,240 --> 00:41:03,480
and isn't confined by

544
00:41:03,510 --> 00:41:05,720
the blooming window others speak of.

545
00:41:09,400 --> 00:41:11,160
Please show mercy

546
00:41:11,610 --> 00:41:13,490
and let me be beautiful forever,

547
00:41:13,910 --> 00:41:15,440
even prettier than before.

548
00:41:15,670 --> 00:41:17,800
Let me become the top courtesan again.

549
00:41:34,110 --> 00:41:35,860
Is he Cheng Huang?

550
00:41:44,130 --> 00:41:45,360
I get it now.

551
00:41:46,010 --> 00:41:47,620
Cheng Huang looks for

552
00:41:47,860 --> 00:41:49,920
people with obsessions in this world

553
00:41:50,040 --> 00:41:52,360
and grants their wishes.

554
00:41:52,390 --> 00:41:54,480
As long as they say yes...

555
00:41:55,010 --> 00:41:57,060
He'll make them a doll.

556
00:42:29,080 --> 00:42:30,240
See anything you like,

557
00:42:30,240 --> 00:42:30,920
Miss?

558
00:42:38,570 --> 00:42:39,590
These dolls...

559
00:42:39,590 --> 00:42:40,630
These dolls

560
00:42:41,080 --> 00:42:42,670
are not entirely dolls.

561
00:42:44,470 --> 00:42:46,070
Just like dolls,

562
00:42:46,310 --> 00:42:47,570
they are neither alive

563
00:42:47,940 --> 00:42:49,140
nor dead.

564
00:42:50,060 --> 00:42:51,140
When their bodies are broken,

565
00:42:51,140 --> 00:42:52,310
they can be fixed.

566
00:42:53,510 --> 00:42:55,410
But just like humans,

567
00:42:56,440 --> 00:42:57,570
they have memories.

568
00:42:58,020 --> 00:42:59,380
They can feel joy

569
00:42:59,550 --> 00:43:00,670
and sadness.

570
00:43:01,730 --> 00:43:03,040
So,

571
00:43:03,070 --> 00:43:04,780
they are dolls,

572
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:07,600
but also not entirely dolls.

573
00:43:14,510 --> 00:43:16,240
I know who you are.

574
00:43:16,720 --> 00:43:17,350
Oh?

575
00:43:19,050 --> 00:43:20,470
You're Cheng Huang.

576
00:43:25,940 --> 00:43:28,610
Why did you turn Heng into a demon?

577
00:43:31,250 --> 00:43:32,420
It wasn't me.

578
00:43:33,790 --> 00:43:35,120
He did it himself.

579
00:43:36,160 --> 00:43:38,720
I just heard his wish

580
00:43:39,300 --> 00:43:41,130
and realized it for him.

581
00:43:42,110 --> 00:43:43,070
Wish?

582
00:43:43,550 --> 00:43:45,100
That's because

583
00:43:45,470 --> 00:43:47,190
you're too outstanding.

584
00:43:51,950 --> 00:43:53,480
You're superior,

585
00:43:55,160 --> 00:43:57,590
so you've never heard my wish.

586
00:43:58,520 --> 00:43:59,760
You have probably

587
00:43:59,940 --> 00:44:01,380
never heard of it.

588
00:44:05,190 --> 00:44:06,920
Wherever I go,

589
00:44:07,800 --> 00:44:09,240
I listen to

590
00:44:09,590 --> 00:44:11,570
the people's wishes.

591
00:44:13,780 --> 00:44:15,760
Then, I choose one

592
00:44:16,080 --> 00:44:18,060
with the strongest obsession

593
00:44:19,790 --> 00:44:21,330
to realize his wish.

594
00:44:23,390 --> 00:44:25,480
Your brother's obsession

595
00:44:25,550 --> 00:44:27,150
is far beyond everyone else.

596
00:44:29,320 --> 00:44:31,000
Do you want to know what it is?

597
00:44:35,920 --> 00:44:37,340
I know.

598
00:44:40,050 --> 00:44:41,600
He wants to be stronger.

599
00:44:44,200 --> 00:44:45,740
He wants to surpass me

600
00:44:47,040 --> 00:44:48,490
and replace me.

601
00:44:50,270 --> 00:44:51,710
He wants to take from me

602
00:44:53,110 --> 00:44:55,760
what originally belonged to him.

603
00:44:59,160 --> 00:45:00,260
How unfortunate.

604
00:45:01,630 --> 00:45:03,660
The mortal eyes

605
00:45:04,010 --> 00:45:06,480
can see mountains and rivers,

606
00:45:07,300 --> 00:45:09,900
but cannot see clearly the people around them.

607
00:45:10,460 --> 00:45:11,580
Although

608
00:45:12,110 --> 00:45:13,860
you're close siblings,

609
00:45:15,210 --> 00:45:17,240
you failed to see clearly

610
00:45:18,960 --> 00:45:21,290
what he really wanted.

611
00:46:11,710 --> 00:46:13,970
Do you dislike practicing martial arts?

612
00:46:15,190 --> 00:46:16,300
Yes.

613
00:46:27,140 --> 00:46:29,050
But I have to become stronger

614
00:46:29,830 --> 00:46:31,430
to protect you.

615
00:46:45,140 --> 00:46:45,870
Sister.

616
00:46:58,690 --> 00:46:59,640
Look.

617
00:47:07,100 --> 00:47:08,910
Although the dress is beautiful,

618
00:47:08,910 --> 00:47:10,570
it's inconvenient to move in.

619
00:47:13,970 --> 00:47:15,470
It doesn't suit me.

620
00:47:45,150 --> 00:47:46,270
What's wrong?

621
00:47:47,510 --> 00:47:48,860
Are you disappointed?

622
00:47:51,260 --> 00:47:53,420
I can grant your wish.
