Thank you, but I'll ask you to keep an eye out.

52
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:12,320
I won't be able to do anything.

53
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:14,320
I'm not sure if I can make it.

54
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:16,320
I'm not sure.

55
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:18,320
I'm not sure.

56
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:20,320
I'm not sure.

57
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:22,320
I'm not sure.

58
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:24,320
I'm not sure.

59
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:26,320

I'm not sure.

68
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:44,320
Of course.

69
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:10,320
Hold this.

70
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:12,320
I'm telling you.

71
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:14,320
Why are you scared?

72
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:35,320
Brother Wang Zhuo

73
00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:39,320
Do you think Ying Lei will blame me?

74
00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:40,320
Of course not

75
00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:43,320
He is protecting you

76
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:46,320
One day

77
00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:49,320
You will also want to protect someone

78
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:56,320
Why do you always hold my bell?

79
00:05:56,320 --> 00:05:58,320
Because holding the bell

80
00:05:59,320 --> 00:06:01,320
I dare to go to the little house

81
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:02,320
By my side

82
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:04,320
No matter how scary the front is

83
00:06:05,320 --> 00:06:07,320
I dare to go forward

84
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:12,320
I will always be there for you

85
00:06:23,320 --> 00:06:25,320
You want to save me?

86
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:28,320
Sorry

87
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:30,320
Sorry

88
00:06:40,320 --> 00:06:42,320
I have no worries

89
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:44,320
I just want to find

90
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:47,320
A place where no one can be proud of

91
00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:51,320
The bell is ringing

92
00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:54,320
I can take you home

93
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:59,320
Who can know the name of the grown-up?

94
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:04,320
Life is very great

95
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:07,320
The bell is ringing

96
00:07:07,320 --> 00:07:11,320
I am all safe

97
00:07:11,320 --> 00:07:12,320
Brother Wang Zhuo

98
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:14,320
I will protect you this time

99
00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:16,320
The bell is ringing

100
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:18,320
I can take you home

101
00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:24,320
Who can know the name of the grown-up?

102
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:28,320
Life is very great

103
00:07:29,320 --> 00:07:32,320
The bell is ringing

104
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:36,320
I am all safe

105
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:43,320
Who has seen a short tailed bird?

106
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:48,320
In the rain, it is her dream

107
00:07:50,320 --> 00:07:55,320
Her eyes are not in the way

108
00:07:55,320 --> 00:07:57,320
I only think about

109
00:07:57,320 --> 00:08:00,320
The bell is ringing

110
00:08:00,320 --> 00:08:02,320
I am all safe

111
00:08:02,320 --> 00:08:04,320
Little wine

112
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:29,320
Brother

113
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:39,320
You scared me

114
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:01,320
Father

115
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:04,320
Father

116
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:06,320
Wake up

117
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:08,320
Father

118
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:30,320
Father

119
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:45,320
Father

120
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:49,320
Little son

121
00:09:58,320 --> 00:09:59,320
Father

122
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:01,320
Little son

123
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:03,320
You know me

124
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:05,320
Father

125
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:08,320
It's good that you can wake up

126
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:12,320
I woke up like this

127
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:22,320
It's the white-collar

128
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:25,320
The white-collar

129
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:27,320
The water is not full

130
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:29,320
The gold is not in the world

131
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:36,320
Father

132
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:39,320
What's wrong?

133
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:45,320
You can't get up in the body of that young man

134
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:47,320
No, father

135
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:49,320
Little son

136
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:51,320
I will save you

137
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:54,320
I can't go back

138
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:58,320
Go save those people

139
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:03,320
They are the people in you

140
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:05,320
There is a person in you

141
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:09,320
Father

142
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:11,320
Father

143

Father

144
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:17,320
It seems that you have to watch me every day

145
00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:19,320
This ungrateful daughter

146
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:21,320
Yes

147
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:25,320
I can't leave you for this life

148
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:27,320
Father

149
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:30,320
Father

150
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:34,320
I will never leave you for this life

151
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:41,320
I can't live like this

152
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:49,320
Father

153
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:52,320
Father

154
00:11:54,320 --> 00:12:01,320
There will be someone in the future who will watch you

155
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:05,320
Take care of you

156
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:07,320
Father

157
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:09,320

The people of the whole city are becoming the demons

186
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:20,320
Yes

187
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:22,320
My tears

188
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:26,320
Can make the demons normal

189
00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:31,320
As long as the white spirit in my body comes out

190
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:33,320
Draw into a river

191
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:37,320
So that everyone can be saved

192
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:40,320
Master taught me

193
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:43,320
This is our white spirit

194
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:47,320
The final magic

195
00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:51,320
The ghost

196
00:14:55,320 --> 00:14:57,320
If you lose the white spirit

197
00:14:57,320 --> 00:14:59,320
You will die

198
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:04,320
I was poisoned by the poison

199
00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:07,320
I can't live long

200
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:13,320
Isn't this a better way to die?

201
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:17,320
I have a better way

202
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:36,320
You have to say it well

203
00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:45,320
I will die

204
00:15:57,320 --> 00:15:59,320
I will kill myself

205
00:16:01,320 --> 00:16:03,320
I will die

206
00:16:03,320 --> 00:16:05,320
I will die

207
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:08,320
I will die

208
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:12,320
But I will never die

209
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:16,320
When you turn a blind eye

210
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:21,320
I won't forgive you

211
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:26,320
Fang Yuzheng

212
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:38,320
Send her home

213
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:40,320
Send her home

214
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:44,320
You know the source of the white spirit's power?

215
00:16:45,320 --> 00:16:47,320
I've heard that it's not true.

216
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:51,320
The white spirit doesn't have the source,

217
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:54,320
but it's the cycle.

218
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:59,320
The reason for the white spirit is the cycle,

219
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:02,320
and it comes from the power.

220
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:05,320
The white spirit is the cycle of the world.

221
00:17:05,320 --> 00:17:06,320
There is a big mess,

222
00:17:06,320 --> 00:17:08,320
and the enemy is the enemy.

223
00:17:08,320 --> 00:17:10,320
The enemy is the enemy,

224
00:17:10,320 --> 00:17:12,320
and the enemy is the enemy.

225
00:17:12,320 --> 00:17:14,320
If you're not there,

226
00:17:14,320 --> 00:17:16,320
how can you get the power?

227
00:17:16,320 --> 00:17:19,320
How can you get the power of the white spirit?

228
00:17:21,320 --> 00:17:22,320
I...

229
00:17:24,320 --> 00:17:27,320
I'm also a part of the cycle of the world.

230
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:32,320
The stronger the power,

231
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:34,320
the stronger the power of the white spirit is.

232
00:17:35,320 --> 00:17:36,320
No.

233
00:17:37,320 --> 00:17:38,320
No.

234
00:17:43,320 --> 00:17:46,320
In the spirit of the king of the world,

235
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:49,320
the future that the dragon has met

236
00:17:49,320 --> 00:17:52,320
is the most important thing I've ever seen.

237
00:17:55,320 --> 00:17:57,320
The white spirit of the soul

238
00:17:57,320 --> 00:18:00,320
is the cycle of the world.

239
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:03,320
The cycle of the world is the strongest power

240
00:18:03,320 --> 00:18:05,320
in the world.

241
00:18:05,320 --> 00:18:06,320
No.

242
00:18:09,320 --> 00:18:11,320
This is what the god woman should do.

243
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:14,320
Instead of you.

244
00:18:25,320 --> 00:18:26,320
I've said that

245
00:18:27,320 --> 00:18:29,320
I will make you live on.

246
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:32,320
I will make you live on.

247
00:18:37,320 --> 00:18:39,320
I will make you live on.

248
00:18:43,320 --> 00:18:45,320
I will make you live on.

249
00:18:55,320 --> 00:18:56,320
Zhe Yuzheng.

250
00:18:56,320 --> 00:18:58,320
I'm not your brother.

251
00:18:58,320 --> 00:18:59,320
Zhe Yuzheng.

252
00:19:03,320 --> 00:19:04,320
Zhe Yuzheng.

253
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:05,320
Zhe Yuzheng.

254
00:19:05,320 --> 00:19:06,320
Zhe Yuzheng.

255
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:12,320
Let go of me.

256
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:13,320
Zhe Yuzheng.

257
00:19:13,320 --> 00:19:14,320
What are you doing?

258
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:16,320
Let go of me.

259
00:19:17,320 --> 00:19:18,320
Let go of me.

260
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:19,320
Let go of me.

261
00:19:29,320 --> 00:19:31,320
Zhe Yuzheng.

262
00:19:35,320 --> 00:19:36,320
Zhe Yuzheng.

263
00:19:43,320 --> 00:19:44,320
Zhe Yuzheng.

264
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:45,320
Let go of me.

265
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:51,320
Zhe Yuzheng.

266
00:19:58,320 --> 00:19:59,320
Zhe Yuzheng.

267
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:29,320
Zhe Yuzheng.

268
00:20:58,320 --> 00:20:59,320
Zhe Yuzheng.

269
00:21:29,320 --> 00:21:30,320
Don't cry.

270
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:33,320
When you wake up,

271
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:36,320
you still have something more important to do.

272
00:21:41,320 --> 00:21:43,320
Do you know why?

273
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:46,320
I'm not good at using my own words.

274
00:21:47,320 --> 00:21:49,320
And then I'll throw away the sect and the sister.

275
00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:51,320
Am I not good at it?

276
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:53,320
Why?

277
00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:56,320
Because I'm not good at it.

278
00:21:57,320 --> 00:21:58,320
Why?

279
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:02,320
Because I only give you one person

280
00:22:03,320 --> 00:22:05,320
to be able to do it on my own.

281
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:08,320
That's the medicine you use for the person you love.

282
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:12,320
I think you're a theory.

283
00:22:13,320 --> 00:22:15,320
So I gave birth to you.

284
00:22:17,320 --> 00:22:18,320
When you give me the theory

285
00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:22,320
and your own medicine,

286
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:26,320
I know you're a spy.

287
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:29,320
Look.

288
00:22:31,320 --> 00:22:32,320
I've been trying to kill you.

289
00:22:35,320 --> 00:22:37,320
But I finally saved you because I was wrong.

290
00:22:39,320 --> 00:22:40,320
In this world,

291
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:43,320
the cause and the result are all wrong.

292
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:47,320
It's always hard to laugh.

293
00:22:47,320 --> 00:22:48,320
I can't laugh.

294
00:22:49,320 --> 00:22:53,320
The life of Xiaojiu is because of your death.

295
00:22:54,320 --> 00:22:55,320
And your life

296
00:22:58,320 --> 00:23:00,320
is because of the death of Lile and Xiaojiu.

297
00:23:01,320 --> 00:23:02,320
Now,

298
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:08,320
the life of the world needs my death.

299
00:23:11,320 --> 00:23:12,320
And my death

300
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:17,320
needs your lifetime of sacrifice

301
00:23:19,320 --> 00:23:22,320
and the same responsibility and sacrifice.

302
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:36,320
It's time to say goodbye.

303
00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:40,320
Our first meeting is your oath.

304
00:23:43,320 --> 00:23:44,320
I will do my best

305
00:23:45,320 --> 00:23:47,320
to protect Tianqi.

306
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:49,320
As long as Zhu Yan

307
00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:52,320
can give me the real way to the Clouds,

308
00:23:53,320 --> 00:23:55,320
I will definitely kill him and kill him.

309
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:14,320
I will do my best to protect Tianqi.

310
00:24:15,320 --> 00:24:17,320
As long as Zhu Yan can give me the real way to the Clouds,

311
00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:20,320
I will definitely kill him and kill him.

312
00:24:21,320 --> 00:24:23,320
I will do my best to protect Tianqi.

313
00:24:25,320 --> 00:24:27,320
I will do my best to protect Tianqi.

314
00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:30,320
I will do my best to protect Tianqi.

315
00:24:31,320 --> 00:24:33,320
I will do my best to protect Tianqi.

316
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:36,320
I will do my best to protect Tianqi.

317
00:24:37,320 --> 00:24:39,320
I will do my best to protect Tianqi.

318
00:24:39,320 --> 00:24:47,320
I will do my best to protect Tianqi.

319
00:24:51,320 --> 00:24:59,320
I will do my best to protect Tianqi.

320
00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:03,320
Zhao Yanzhou,

321
00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:07,320
there is another choice.

322
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:11,320
There is another choice.

323
00:25:14,320 --> 00:25:15,320
There is another choice.

324
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:23,320
Yinglong,

325
00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:25,320
for the sake of the life,

326
00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:27,320
I am a god.

327
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:32,320
But there is someone who will give him the title of the evil.

328
00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:36,320
The soldier is considered a living hell.

329
00:25:36,320 --> 00:25:39,320
The living hell is called a god.

330
00:25:42,320 --> 00:25:44,320
But he is a mortal.

331
00:25:49,320 --> 00:25:54,320
The world is so vast and vast.

332
00:25:58,320 --> 00:26:00,320
Do you remember our agreement?

333
00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:07,320
Yes.

334
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:11,320
Lord Zhao,

335
00:26:13,320 --> 00:26:14,320
this time,

336
00:26:15,320 --> 00:26:17,320
don't be a fool.

337
00:26:31,320 --> 00:26:32,320
Lord Zhao,

338
00:26:33,320 --> 00:26:35,320
I knew you couldn't do it.

339
00:26:37,320 --> 00:26:39,320
So I decided to kill you.

340
00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:46,320
You don't need to choose for me.

341
00:26:49,320 --> 00:26:51,320
This is my own decision.

342
00:26:53,320 --> 00:26:58,320
I will try my best to be the best killer.

343
00:27:03,320 --> 00:27:05,320
You don't need to do it for me.

344
00:27:09,320 --> 00:27:10,320
Zhao,

345
00:27:13,320 --> 00:27:15,320
you still have to do it.

346
00:27:27,320 --> 00:27:28,320
Chen Yuzheng,

347
00:27:29,320 --> 00:27:30,320
Chen Yuzheng.

348
00:27:49,320 --> 00:27:50,320
Chen Yuzheng.

349
00:27:58,320 --> 00:27:59,320
Chen Yuzheng.

350
00:28:01,320 --> 00:28:02,320
Chen Yuzheng.

351
00:28:03,320 --> 00:28:04,320
Chen Yuzheng.

352
00:28:05,320 --> 00:28:06,320
Chen Yuzheng.

353
00:28:07,320 --> 00:28:08,320
Chen Yuzheng.

354
00:28:09,320 --> 00:28:10,320
Chen Yuzheng.

355
00:28:11,320 --> 00:28:12,320
Chen Yuzheng.

356
00:28:13,320 --> 00:28:14,320
Chen Yuzheng.

357
00:28:15,320 --> 00:28:16,320
Chen Yuzheng.

358
00:28:17,320 --> 00:28:18,320
Chen Yuzheng.

359
00:28:19,320 --> 00:28:20,320
Chen Yuzheng.

360
00:28:21,320 --> 00:28:22,320
Chen Yuzheng.

361
00:28:23,320 --> 00:28:24,320
Chen Yuzheng.

362
00:28:25,320 --> 00:28:26,320
Chen Yuzheng.

363
00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:27,320
Chen Yuzheng.

364
00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:29,320
Chen Yuzheng.

365
00:28:30,320 --> 00:28:31,320
Chen Yuzheng.

366
00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:33,320
Chen Yuzheng.

367
00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:35,320
Chen Yuzheng.

368
00:28:36,320 --> 00:28:37,320
Chen Yuzheng.

369
00:28:38,320 --> 00:28:39,320
Chen Yuzheng.

370
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:41,320
Chen Yuzheng.

371
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:43,320
Chen Yuzheng.

372
00:28:44,320 --> 00:28:45,320

Chen Yuzheng.

376
00:28:52,320 --> 00:28:53,320
Chen Yuzheng.

377
00:28:54,320 --> 00:28:55,320
Chen Yuzheng.

378
00:28:56,320 --> 00:28:57,320
Chen Yuzheng.

379
00:28:58,320 --> 00:28:59,320

Chen Yuzheng.

384
00:29:08,320 --> 00:29:09,320
Chen Yuzheng.

385
00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:11,320
Chen Yuzheng.

386
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:13,320
Chen Yuzheng.

387
00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:15,320
Chen Yuzheng.

388
00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:17,320
Chen Yuzheng.

389
00:29:18,320 --> 00:29:19,320
Chen Yuzheng.

390
00:29:20,320 --> 00:29:21,320
Chen Yuzheng.

391
00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:23,320
Chen Yuzheng.

392
00:29:24,320 --> 00:29:25,320
Chen Yuzheng.

393
00:29:26,320 --> 00:29:27,320
Chen Yuzheng.

394
00:29:28,320 --> 00:29:29,320
Chen Yuzheng.

395
00:29:30,320 --> 00:29:31,320
Chen Yuzheng.

396
00:29:32,320 --> 00:29:33,320
Chen Yuzheng.

397
00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:35,320
Chen Yuzheng.

398
00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:37,320
Chen Yuzheng.

399
00:29:41,320 --> 00:29:42,320
The poison in my body...

400
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:45,320
has been sucked away by me.

401
00:29:49,320 --> 00:29:50,320
Don't worry.

402
00:29:52,320 --> 00:29:53,320
I'm fine.

403
00:29:57,320 --> 00:29:58,820
Very heavy.

404
00:30:02,320 --> 00:30:04,320
Theirtail is severely injured, right?

405
00:30:26,320 --> 00:30:31,320
I know you are sad, but you are crying.

406
00:30:32,320 --> 00:30:34,320
Don't be sad for too long.

407
00:30:36,320 --> 00:30:41,320
I can't bear to let you be sad for me.

408
00:30:42,320 --> 00:30:46,320
Your tears will always be on the bed.

409
00:30:47,320 --> 00:30:50,320
You shouldn't cry for me.

410
00:30:56,320 --> 00:31:01,320
I can't bear to let you be sad for too long.

411
00:31:22,320 --> 00:31:24,320
You won't die easily.

412
00:31:24,320 --> 00:31:28,320
I will always be with you.

413
00:31:30,320 --> 00:31:32,320
You lied to me.

414
00:31:35,320 --> 00:31:38,320
You liar.

415
00:31:54,320 --> 00:31:57,320
I will always be with you.

416
00:31:57,320 --> 00:32:00,320
I will always be with you.

417
00:32:18,320 --> 00:32:20,320
I met you.

418
00:32:21,320 --> 00:32:26,320
It's like I had a long and sad dream.

419
00:32:27,320 --> 00:32:30,320
I just need to wake up.

420
00:32:31,320 --> 00:32:35,320
I should leave now.

421
00:32:57,320 --> 00:32:59,320
I'm sorry.

422
00:33:00,320 --> 00:33:02,320
I'm sorry.

423
00:33:02,320 --> 00:33:05,320
I'm sorry.

424
00:33:05,320 --> 00:33:07,320
I'm sorry.

425
00:33:07,320 --> 00:33:09,320
I'm sorry.

426
00:33:09,320 --> 00:33:11,320
I'm sorry.

427
00:33:11,320 --> 00:33:13,320
I'm sorry.

428
00:33:13,320 --> 00:33:15,320
I'm sorry.

429
00:33:15,320 --> 00:33:17,320
I'm sorry.

430
00:33:17,320 --> 00:33:19,320
I'm sorry.

431
00:33:19,320 --> 00:33:21,320
I'm sorry.

432
00:33:21,320 --> 00:33:23,320
I'm sorry.

433
00:33:23,320 --> 00:33:25,320
I'm sorry.

434
00:33:25,320 --> 00:33:27,320
I'm sorry.

435
00:33:27,320 --> 00:33:29,320
I'm sorry.

436
00:33:31,320 --> 00:33:33,320
I'm sorry.

437
00:33:33,320 --> 00:33:34,320
I'm sorry.

438
00:33:34,320 --> 00:33:39,320
I said I didn't mean it.

439
00:33:40,320 --> 00:33:41,320
Zhang Yanzhou

440
00:33:41,320 --> 00:33:45,320
I know each flower is angry with us.

441
00:33:45,320 --> 00:33:46,320
but you can't

442
00:33:47,320 --> 00:33:49,320
let's stand by the Lord in the dark

443
00:33:49,320 --> 00:33:53,320
The long road is slowly and slowly,

444
00:33:53,320 --> 00:33:55,320
it's hard to leave.

445
00:33:57,320 --> 00:33:58,320
Lord Xiao Zhu,

446
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:02,320
the white goddess's eyes are painted with rain.

447
00:34:04,320 --> 00:34:05,320
The road is full of tears.

448
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:11,320
Then,

449
00:34:13,320 --> 00:34:14,320
everyone can be saved.

450
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:18,320
I will make you my god.

451
00:34:19,320 --> 00:34:21,320
I will not let you go.

452
00:34:25,320 --> 00:34:26,320
Your tears

453
00:34:27,320 --> 00:34:29,320
will be buried with a spear.

454
00:34:30,320 --> 00:34:32,320
You shouldn't have left them for me.

455
00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:41,320
The dead demon

456
00:34:42,320 --> 00:34:44,320
will become the star of the sky.

457
00:34:47,320 --> 00:34:48,320
What about you?

458
00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:52,320
I will become a rain too.

459
00:34:54,320 --> 00:34:55,320
In the future,

460
00:34:56,320 --> 00:34:58,320
as long as it rains,

461
00:35:01,320 --> 00:35:03,320
I will be with you.

462
00:35:19,320 --> 00:35:21,320
I will not let you go.

463
00:35:32,320 --> 00:35:35,320
Who will cry for years?

464
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:39,320
I will be with you.

465
00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:45,320
I will be with you.

466
00:35:49,320 --> 00:35:51,320
I will sing the song of the light.

467
00:35:52,320 --> 00:35:54,320
I want you.

468
00:35:55,320 --> 00:35:58,320
I am looking for you.

469
00:35:59,320 --> 00:36:02,320
Let the summer spring stop.

470
00:36:03,320 --> 00:36:05,320
Let the snow stop.

471
00:36:06,320 --> 00:36:08,320
I will stay here.

472
00:36:09,320 --> 00:36:12,320
I will go to the wind.

473
00:36:13,320 --> 00:36:16,320
Finally, the wind blows.

474
00:36:16,320 --> 00:36:19,320
I know where you are.

475
00:36:19,320 --> 00:36:25,320
I will follow you.

476
00:36:26,320 --> 00:36:29,320
I will find you.

477
00:36:33,320 --> 00:36:35,320
I will find you.

478
00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:48,320
I will find you.
