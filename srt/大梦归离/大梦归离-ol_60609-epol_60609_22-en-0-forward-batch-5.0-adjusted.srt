[Episode 22]

3
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:22,890
She is the murderer.

4
00:02:29,890 --> 00:02:31,720
So Ms. Wen Xiao is not a demon.

5
00:02:46,070 --> 00:02:46,790
He's here.

6
00:02:46,829 --> 00:02:47,700
Brother Zhuo!

7
00:02:48,660 --> 00:02:49,570
Mr. Zhuo!

8
00:02:49,630 --> 00:02:50,670
Wake up!

9
00:02:50,690 --> 00:02:51,850
Where is Ao Yin?

10
00:02:52,390 --> 00:02:53,050
She ran away.

11
00:02:53,050 --> 00:02:53,740
She ran away!

12
00:02:53,740 --> 00:02:54,340
After her!

13
00:02:54,350 --> 00:02:54,750
After her!

14
00:02:54,750 --> 00:02:55,350
After her!

15
00:03:05,110 --> 00:03:06,640
Jiu, slow down.

16
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:08,030
Ying Lei, stop yelling.

17
00:03:08,050 --> 00:03:09,940
Whose stairs are so...

18
00:03:14,830 --> 00:03:15,690
Where is Ao Yin?

19
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:18,960
She escaped.

20
00:03:19,830 --> 00:03:20,310
I didn't expect that

21
00:03:20,310 --> 00:03:22,190
the Huanling Powder mixed with the Kusnezoff Monkshood Root

22
00:03:22,190 --> 00:03:23,579
still doesn't work.

23
00:03:23,700 --> 00:03:24,850
What should we do?

24
00:03:25,079 --> 00:03:26,890
Although we didn't catch Ao Yin,

25
00:03:26,950 --> 00:03:28,160
we have successfully

26
00:03:28,350 --> 00:03:28,860
forced her to transform

27
00:03:28,860 --> 00:03:30,710
in public many times.

28
00:03:30,950 --> 00:03:32,270
So many people in Tianxiang Pavilion

29
00:03:32,270 --> 00:03:33,660
saw it with their own eyes

30
00:03:33,660 --> 00:03:35,910
that Ao Yin is a demon who can transform

31
00:03:36,030 --> 00:03:37,950
into a human and bewitch people.

32
00:03:37,980 --> 00:03:38,470
Yes.

33
00:03:38,829 --> 00:03:40,160
Her biggest mistake was

34
00:03:40,190 --> 00:03:41,890
she transformed into Wen.

35
00:03:41,980 --> 00:03:43,860
Everyone there can prove it.

36
00:03:43,890 --> 00:03:45,390
The Prime Minister's death

37
00:03:45,390 --> 00:03:46,950
is clearly beyond human capability.

38
00:03:46,950 --> 00:03:48,070
The evidence should be enough

39
00:03:48,070 --> 00:03:49,710
to clear Wen of suspicion.

40
00:04:02,079 --> 00:04:02,880
Brother Zhuo?

41
00:04:18,230 --> 00:04:19,190
Wen Xiao.

42
00:04:19,910 --> 00:04:20,870
Father.

43
00:04:21,670 --> 00:04:22,649
Wen Xiao.

44
00:04:22,790 --> 00:04:23,820
Are you alright?

45
00:04:24,310 --> 00:04:26,170
Wen Zongyu finally released you.

46
00:04:26,190 --> 00:04:26,920
Father,

47
00:04:27,310 --> 00:04:28,070
I'm fine.

48
00:04:28,630 --> 00:04:29,700
We have witnesses.

49
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:31,320
They had to release me.

50
00:04:32,030 --> 00:04:33,130
But Sister Pei

51
00:04:33,390 --> 00:04:35,120
is still in Wen Zongyu's hands.

52
00:04:35,630 --> 00:04:36,960
You go take a rest first.

53
00:04:37,110 --> 00:04:38,670
I'll figure out a way to save her.

54
00:04:38,670 --> 00:04:39,620
There is a way.

55
00:04:39,830 --> 00:04:41,630
Sister Pei has figured out a way.

56
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:42,730
Zhuo,

57
00:04:42,990 --> 00:04:44,250
go to the Chongwu Camp.

58
00:05:06,530 --> 00:05:08,470
Have you brought what I want?

59
00:05:11,420 --> 00:05:12,620
If I die,

60
00:05:14,740 --> 00:05:16,960
your research on demonized humans

61
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:19,720
can no longer stay hidden.

62
00:05:22,380 --> 00:05:25,340
You should know Cheng Huang's magical instrument

63
00:05:25,550 --> 00:05:27,480
can store memories.

64
00:05:28,770 --> 00:05:30,360
Zhao Yuanzhou and I

65
00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:33,800
have already stored everything that happened in the dungeon

66
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:35,850
in the sundial

67
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:37,560
and given it to Mr. Situ.

68
00:05:40,990 --> 00:05:41,990
You go first.

69
00:05:46,540 --> 00:05:47,650
Be careful.

70
00:06:42,610 --> 00:06:43,670
What do we eat?

71
00:06:44,909 --> 00:06:45,750
Mr. Zhuo,

72
00:06:45,909 --> 00:06:47,840
do you want to go somewhere to play?

73
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:51,700
Jiu.

74
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:52,540
Jiu.

75
00:06:52,830 --> 00:06:53,630
Come here.

76
00:07:21,590 --> 00:07:23,990
Are you still worried about Zhao Yuanzhou?

77
00:07:25,150 --> 00:07:26,550
It's been a day.

78
00:07:27,590 --> 00:07:29,600
I wonder if he's okay

79
00:07:30,510 --> 00:07:31,590
or conscious.

80
00:07:39,190 --> 00:07:40,330
No news

81
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:41,710
is good news.

82
00:07:46,620 --> 00:07:48,590
What should we do next?

83
00:07:55,760 --> 00:07:57,500
We already have the Yao Water.

84
00:07:58,030 --> 00:07:59,170
Next,

85
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:02,080
we should get a piece of the Divine Wood as soon as possible.

86
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:04,090
But where can we find it?

87
00:08:04,670 --> 00:08:05,390
I guess

88
00:08:05,470 --> 00:08:06,510
the key to finding it

89
00:08:06,510 --> 00:08:07,730
is your mother,

90
00:08:07,830 --> 00:08:08,790
Lord Bai Yan.

91
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:09,800
My mother?

92
00:08:11,470 --> 00:08:13,260
Great Demon once said

93
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:15,700
your mother is the descendant of the Divine Tree of Jianmu.

94
00:08:15,700 --> 00:08:17,980
Her true form is also a piece of the Divine Wood.

95
00:08:17,980 --> 00:08:19,080
So I think

96
00:08:19,390 --> 00:08:22,480
since the Baize Token is made of a piece of the Divine Wood,

97
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:24,330
maybe your mother's true form

98
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:26,280
can repair the Baize Token.

99
00:08:26,670 --> 00:08:27,510
Butâ€¦

100
00:08:28,630 --> 00:08:29,430
What's wrong?

101
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:38,210
The Divine Tree of Jianmu and the White Emperor Tower

102
00:08:38,210 --> 00:08:39,270
were destroyed

103
00:08:39,270 --> 00:08:40,990
by the Nine-legged Golden Crow 500 years ago.

104
00:08:40,990 --> 00:08:41,610
After that,

105
00:08:41,610 --> 00:08:44,350
two unknown great demons appeared in the Wilderness.

106
00:08:44,350 --> 00:08:46,570
They used their demonic power and blood oaths

107
00:08:46,570 --> 00:08:49,310
to repair the Divine Tree of Jianmu and the White Emperor Tower.

108
00:08:49,310 --> 00:08:50,880
But after the Baize Token disappeared,

109
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:53,220
the Divine Tree of Jianmu withered.

110
00:08:53,330 --> 00:08:54,930
The Divine Tree of Jianmu now

111
00:08:57,010 --> 00:08:59,070
is just something immortal but dead.

112
00:09:05,110 --> 00:09:06,590
Immortal but dead?

113
00:09:07,510 --> 00:09:08,310
Yes.

114
00:09:10,190 --> 00:09:12,720
The Divine Tree of Jianmu has been destroyed.

115
00:09:12,950 --> 00:09:14,770
Your mother's true form

116
00:09:14,980 --> 00:09:16,510
is naturally lifeless too.

117
00:09:21,670 --> 00:09:22,480
So,

118
00:09:23,150 --> 00:09:25,110
Lord Bai Yan

119
00:09:25,310 --> 00:09:27,670
needs the Baize Token's power

120
00:09:27,830 --> 00:09:30,310
to transform from her true form into Jiu's mother.

121
00:09:30,310 --> 00:09:31,790
Repairing the Baize Token

122
00:09:31,790 --> 00:09:34,990
needs Lord Bai Yan's true form, a piece of the Divine Wood.

123
00:09:36,090 --> 00:09:37,510
Isn't this a dead end?

124
00:09:40,700 --> 00:09:41,940
Is the Wilderness

125
00:09:43,170 --> 00:09:44,630
destined to be destroyed?

126
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:51,130
Is Great Demon...

127
00:09:54,680 --> 00:09:56,840
really going to be...

128
00:10:28,750 --> 00:10:29,440
I have an idea!

129
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:30,240
I have an idea!

130
00:10:32,050 --> 00:10:32,720
I have an idea!

131
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:34,120
I've come up with an idea!

132
00:10:34,380 --> 00:10:35,190
I have a way!

133
00:10:35,230 --> 00:10:35,810
What is it?

134
00:10:35,810 --> 00:10:36,370
No.

135
00:10:36,590 --> 00:10:37,510
It's not that I have a way.

136
00:10:37,510 --> 00:10:38,710
It's Jiu who has a way.

137
00:10:39,390 --> 00:10:40,330
What on earth is going on?

138
00:10:40,330 --> 00:10:41,110
Leave it.

139
00:10:41,110 --> 00:10:41,710
Let's go!

140
00:10:41,730 --> 00:10:42,190
Hurry!

141
00:10:43,050 --> 00:10:44,030
This way.

142
00:10:44,060 --> 00:10:44,710
Be careful.

143
00:10:44,710 --> 00:10:45,670
The floor is wet.

144
00:10:45,770 --> 00:10:46,680
Let's go.

145
00:10:46,750 --> 00:10:47,360
Jiu!

146
00:10:48,310 --> 00:10:48,830
What?

147
00:10:48,950 --> 00:10:49,550
Me?

148
00:10:49,710 --> 00:10:50,510
That's right.

149
00:10:50,590 --> 00:10:51,470
You.

150
00:10:51,910 --> 00:10:53,630
Back in Lingxi Villa,

151
00:10:53,660 --> 00:10:54,920
we needed the cypress that can ward off the plague

152
00:10:54,920 --> 00:10:56,350
as the enhancing ingredient.

153
00:10:56,350 --> 00:10:57,550
But the cypress

154
00:10:57,550 --> 00:10:58,610
withered long ago.

155
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:00,080
Jiu, your blood

156
00:11:00,110 --> 00:11:01,710
accidentally dripped on it.

157
00:11:02,290 --> 00:11:04,170
A new bud emerged

158
00:11:04,190 --> 00:11:06,310
from where your blood dripped.

159
00:11:17,310 --> 00:11:18,490
I see.

160
00:11:18,630 --> 00:11:20,730
Jiu has the blood

161
00:11:20,870 --> 00:11:22,350
of the human, god, and demon clans.

162
00:11:22,350 --> 00:11:23,830
It is the unique lineage

163
00:11:23,850 --> 00:11:25,260
that grants Jiu's blood

164
00:11:25,470 --> 00:11:26,590
the power

165
00:11:26,590 --> 00:11:28,030
to revive all things.

166
00:11:30,850 --> 00:11:31,850
What do you think?

167
00:11:31,940 --> 00:11:33,580
My idea is awesome, right?

168
00:11:59,270 --> 00:12:00,370
I, Zhuo Yichen,

169
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:01,740
swear to Heaven

170
00:12:02,270 --> 00:12:03,450
that as long as Zhu Yan

171
00:12:03,450 --> 00:12:06,290
teaches me the true way to use the Cloud Light Sword,

172
00:12:06,290 --> 00:12:09,120
I will surely slay him with my sword.

173
00:12:10,860 --> 00:12:12,150
If I break this oath,

174
00:12:12,380 --> 00:12:14,210
may Heaven and Earth destroy me,

175
00:12:14,710 --> 00:12:16,110
and my soul be scattered.

176
00:12:30,670 --> 00:12:31,630
Here, Jiu.

177
00:13:12,550 --> 00:13:13,550
I did it.

178
00:13:14,970 --> 00:13:16,040
Great Demon can be saved!

179
00:13:16,040 --> 00:13:16,840
Great!

180
00:13:19,700 --> 00:13:21,020
Jiu, you're amazing.

181
00:13:23,110 --> 00:13:23,950
What about me?

182
00:13:24,630 --> 00:13:26,200
Shouldn't you praise me?

183
00:13:28,710 --> 00:13:30,120
Mountain God Ying Lei,

184
00:13:30,150 --> 00:13:31,390
you're amazing too.

185
00:13:34,710 --> 00:13:35,510
Mountain God?

186
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:38,460
He omitted the word "Little"?

187
00:13:54,870 --> 00:13:55,830
Wen Xiao,

188
00:13:56,070 --> 00:13:56,870
what's wrong?

189
00:13:59,870 --> 00:14:01,530
The Divine Wood is like water.

190
00:14:01,830 --> 00:14:03,690
It takes 100 years to grow leaves,

191
00:14:04,910 --> 00:14:06,350
100 years to bloom,

192
00:14:07,710 --> 00:14:09,110
and 100 years to fruit.

193
00:14:12,310 --> 00:14:13,970
Only the trunk of a Divine Tree

194
00:14:15,780 --> 00:14:18,370
over 300 years old can repair the Baize Token.

195
00:14:22,350 --> 00:14:24,310
I don't think this new bud

196
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:27,400
can...

197
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:29,250
save him.

198
00:14:31,990 --> 00:14:33,070
300 years?

199
00:14:34,350 --> 00:14:36,310
How can we wait 300 years?

200
00:14:47,770 --> 00:14:48,770
Maybe...

201
00:14:49,950 --> 00:14:52,210
he can't even make it through three days.

202
00:15:29,480 --> 00:15:31,500
Protect the Wilderness

203
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:34,140
till the end

204
00:15:35,220 --> 00:15:36,470
of your life.

205
00:15:56,120 --> 00:15:57,390
You still want to

206
00:15:57,420 --> 00:15:59,190
go to Archives at this hour?

207
00:16:00,190 --> 00:16:02,140
Zhao Yuanzhou is suffering

208
00:16:02,170 --> 00:16:03,700
every second now.

209
00:16:05,320 --> 00:16:07,620
I must find another way.

233
00:17:25,569 --> 00:17:27,950
â™«This karmaâ™«

234
00:18:03,110 --> 00:18:05,550
Mr. Zhuo, you delivered supper yourself.

235
00:18:07,430 --> 00:18:09,380
If the servants find out,

236
00:18:09,750 --> 00:18:11,550
I guess they'll faint from fear.

237
00:18:15,820 --> 00:18:17,490
Pei Sijing told me

238
00:18:17,780 --> 00:18:19,380
you didn't even have dinner.

239
00:18:21,270 --> 00:18:23,070
I made stewed snow pears for you.

240
00:18:24,870 --> 00:18:26,070
Eat it while it's hot.

241
00:18:37,770 --> 00:18:39,240
Where are you going?

242
00:19:01,050 --> 00:19:03,250
I'm going to turn up the oil lamp for you,

243
00:19:04,750 --> 00:19:06,550
so that you can see more clearly.

244
00:19:18,700 --> 00:19:20,230
What are you worried about?

245
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,930
Are you worried that I'll kill him?

246
00:19:26,190 --> 00:19:27,720
It's useless to be worried.

247
00:19:33,350 --> 00:19:34,750
I know in the end,

248
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:38,500
you will.

249
00:19:43,020 --> 00:19:43,590
Yes.

250
00:19:49,320 --> 00:19:51,250
If in the end,

251
00:19:52,280 --> 00:19:54,480
his malicious energy is out of control,

252
00:19:54,830 --> 00:19:56,030
and he loses his mind,

253
00:20:00,940 --> 00:20:01,910
I will.

254
00:20:29,510 --> 00:20:30,550
I once was

255
00:20:32,210 --> 00:20:33,820
as determined as you.

256
00:20:37,990 --> 00:20:39,710
But now,

257
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:43,370
I've realized I can't do that.

258
00:20:48,450 --> 00:20:50,010
I still want to save him.

259
00:20:52,910 --> 00:20:54,300
I don't want him to die.

260
00:21:19,230 --> 00:21:20,390
I've already

261
00:21:20,690 --> 00:21:22,330
cleaned it.

262
00:21:24,190 --> 00:21:25,190
It's okay.

263
00:21:33,590 --> 00:21:35,050
You should wipe your face.

264
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:53,470
The Demon Hunting Bureau

265
00:21:53,470 --> 00:21:55,890
has stopped looking for Zhao Yuanzhou.

266
00:21:56,070 --> 00:21:59,000
Looks like they already know where Zhao Yuanzhou is.

267
00:22:00,800 --> 00:22:03,310
It's time to put some pressure on them,

268
00:22:03,790 --> 00:22:06,070
so that Zhao Yuanzhou can have nowhere to hide.

269
00:22:06,070 --> 00:22:06,970
Don't worry.

270
00:22:07,260 --> 00:22:08,590
This time,

271
00:22:08,610 --> 00:22:11,140
Zhao Yuanzhou is within our grasp.

272
00:22:38,360 --> 00:22:40,850
Is it painful?

273
00:22:44,540 --> 00:22:46,030
I don't mind.

274
00:22:51,040 --> 00:22:53,250
Demons want to become humans.

275
00:22:54,110 --> 00:22:56,720
Humans want to become immortals.

276
00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:00,450
But immortals are unmoved

277
00:23:02,350 --> 00:23:03,600
by love.

278
00:23:28,350 --> 00:23:29,470
The Chongwu Camp has reported

279
00:23:29,470 --> 00:23:31,150
Zhao Yuanzhou's loss of control and escape

280
00:23:31,150 --> 00:23:32,410
to King Xiang.

281
00:23:32,670 --> 00:23:34,000
King Xiang was furious.

282
00:23:34,060 --> 00:23:35,200
This morning, he ordered us

283
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:37,330
to arrest Zhao Yuanzhou immediately.

284
00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:42,040
Otherwise, everyone in the Demon Hunting Bureau will be beheaded.

285
00:23:42,040 --> 00:23:43,110
Mr. Zhuo,

286
00:23:44,030 --> 00:23:45,770
we can't delay any longer.

287
00:23:47,720 --> 00:23:48,560
Okay.

288
00:23:49,590 --> 00:23:50,630
Got it.

289
00:23:51,550 --> 00:23:52,370
Father.

290
00:23:54,070 --> 00:23:55,190
Zhuo.

291
00:24:18,470 --> 00:24:19,480
Zhuo!

292
00:24:20,180 --> 00:24:21,160
Zhuo!

293
00:24:37,470 --> 00:24:38,600
Zhuo!

294
00:25:21,650 --> 00:25:24,220
Stop thinking about her.

295
00:25:25,590 --> 00:25:27,950
You are not qualified.

296
00:25:32,360 --> 00:25:35,150
You killed her master with your own hands.

297
00:25:37,350 --> 00:25:40,910
Do you still think you can be with her?

298
00:25:43,090 --> 00:25:47,570
You killed Zhuo Yichen's father and brother with your own hands.

299
00:25:48,990 --> 00:25:50,270
Do you still expect him

300
00:25:50,270 --> 00:25:53,350
to show you mercy?

301
00:25:54,230 --> 00:25:56,590
What are you still hoping for?

302
00:25:56,760 --> 00:25:58,470
Give up.

303
00:25:59,250 --> 00:26:01,250
Look at yourself.

304
00:26:02,110 --> 00:26:04,150
And look at me.

305
00:26:06,150 --> 00:26:07,700
Embrace me.

306
00:26:08,150 --> 00:26:09,650
Embrace me!

307
00:26:09,790 --> 00:26:10,550
Shut up!

308
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:04,260
Mr. Zhuo.

309
00:27:06,950 --> 00:27:08,210
I'm here to see you off.

310
00:27:16,870 --> 00:27:18,800
Little Mountain God, you've been in the mortal world for a long time.

311
00:27:18,800 --> 00:27:20,670
I didn't expect you to be so familiar

312
00:27:20,670 --> 00:27:22,190
with our customs and etiquette.

313
00:27:22,190 --> 00:27:23,600
Your customs?

314
00:27:23,710 --> 00:27:24,510
Yes.

315
00:27:25,260 --> 00:27:27,260
Soldiers would drink wine

316
00:27:27,310 --> 00:27:28,840
before they go into battle.

317
00:27:29,070 --> 00:27:31,570
First, it's to inspire the heroes

318
00:27:32,110 --> 00:27:34,220
and wish for their early triumphant return.

319
00:27:34,220 --> 00:27:35,320
Second?

320
00:27:37,750 --> 00:27:39,260
Second...

321
00:27:40,650 --> 00:27:42,460
if the heroes can never return,

322
00:27:44,520 --> 00:27:46,850
This will be the last farewell drink.

323
00:27:50,500 --> 00:27:52,030
On the annual memorial day,

324
00:27:53,280 --> 00:27:54,640
you can spill wine to commemorate us.

325
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:55,650
God forbid.

326
00:27:55,870 --> 00:27:58,200
Just pretend I never asked this question.

327
00:27:58,550 --> 00:27:59,350
Mr. Zhuo.

328
00:27:59,350 --> 00:28:00,030
Here's the pomegranate flower wine

329
00:28:00,030 --> 00:28:01,620
I brewed myself.

330
00:28:02,040 --> 00:28:03,630
I put the Mountain God's blessings in it.

331
00:28:03,630 --> 00:28:04,850
It can strengthen your body

332
00:28:04,850 --> 00:28:06,160
and replenish your spiritual energy.

333
00:28:06,160 --> 00:28:08,160
I want you and Great Demon to have it.

334
00:28:12,830 --> 00:28:14,760
So you also miss Great Demon.

335
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:19,200
I just wonder

336
00:28:19,220 --> 00:28:20,630
how he's doing now,

337
00:28:21,990 --> 00:28:23,520
and if he's feeling unwell.

338
00:28:24,950 --> 00:28:26,820
I hope he can remain sensible.

339
00:28:27,180 --> 00:28:28,690
I hope that when we meet again,

340
00:28:28,690 --> 00:28:30,420
we can sit down and have a drink.

341
00:28:31,220 --> 00:28:34,420
Then it'll be worth it, having met each other in this life.

342
00:28:37,090 --> 00:28:38,910
Let's have a drink first.

343
00:28:42,050 --> 00:28:42,790
Let me.

344
00:28:47,310 --> 00:28:49,970
I've never had a drink with you before, Mr. Zhuo.

345
00:28:50,550 --> 00:28:51,820
I never thought

346
00:28:51,850 --> 00:28:53,710
the first time would be like this.

347
00:29:11,310 --> 00:29:12,560
It seems

348
00:29:13,830 --> 00:29:15,630
he and I never had a chance

349
00:29:15,650 --> 00:29:17,450
to have a drink properly either.

350
00:29:38,210 --> 00:29:40,050
If I don't make it back,

351
00:29:41,780 --> 00:29:43,660
please give this

352
00:29:43,690 --> 00:29:44,890
to Wen Xiao.

353
00:29:44,920 --> 00:29:46,000
No, no.

354
00:29:46,290 --> 00:29:47,340
Mr. Zhuo.

355
00:29:47,640 --> 00:29:48,950
You must come back safely,

356
00:29:48,770 --> 00:29:52,620
â™«Footsteps echo, one by oneâ™«

357
00:29:50,200 --> 00:29:51,000
and give this

358
00:29:51,060 --> 00:29:52,850
to the Goddess personally.

359
00:29:53,230 --> 00:29:56,080
â™«Sorrows scattered, lost to the windâ™«

360
00:29:53,250 --> 00:29:53,910
I can't do you

361
00:29:53,910 --> 00:29:54,670
this favor.

362
00:29:57,510 --> 00:30:01,330
â™«Not forgetting, nor dwelling onâ™«

363
00:30:01,710 --> 00:30:04,560
â™«The way back homeâ™«

364
00:30:05,270 --> 00:30:06,940
â™«With strong willâ™«

365
00:30:05,460 --> 00:30:06,520
Are you leaving?

366
00:30:07,300 --> 00:30:10,870
â™«I slowly carve outâ™«

367
00:30:08,820 --> 00:30:09,830
Take the wine.

368
00:30:11,320 --> 00:30:12,240
Come on.

369
00:30:11,420 --> 00:30:13,220
â™«Growthâ™«

370
00:30:13,770 --> 00:30:15,360
â™«Turning backâ™«

371
00:30:15,980 --> 00:30:19,240
â™«I find you still in that familiar placeâ™«

372
00:30:20,030 --> 00:30:21,710
â™«Waiting thereâ™«

373
00:30:34,150 --> 00:30:35,900
Don't be sad for me.

374
00:30:37,050 --> 00:30:38,640
The dead demons

375
00:30:39,180 --> 00:30:41,340
will become the sun, moon, and stars.

376
00:30:42,600 --> 00:30:44,320
I can also turn into rain.

377
00:30:46,020 --> 00:30:47,790
From now on, whenever it rains,

378
00:30:51,580 --> 00:30:53,710
it'll be me coming to keep you company.

379
00:31:01,730 --> 00:31:04,480
You kept talking about dying.

380
00:31:05,710 --> 00:31:06,860
See?

381
00:31:08,590 --> 00:31:11,650
Good wishes never come true, while bad omens always do.

382
00:31:11,850 --> 00:31:13,590
God is also unhappy about it.

383
00:31:24,980 --> 00:31:26,040
Sister Wen.

384
00:31:33,490 --> 00:31:34,750
Where is Brother Zhuo?

385
00:31:34,750 --> 00:31:36,140
I thought he was here.

386
00:31:37,380 --> 00:31:38,830
He has set off.

387
00:31:44,870 --> 00:31:46,470
Although Great Demon...

388
00:31:46,890 --> 00:31:48,190
Wow!

389
00:31:48,800 --> 00:31:49,350
Wow!

390
00:31:49,380 --> 00:31:51,230
Although he used to scare me a lot,

391
00:31:51,230 --> 00:31:53,940
after being together every day these days,

392
00:31:55,830 --> 00:31:56,750
it seems

393
00:31:58,280 --> 00:32:00,540
I've become used to having him by my side.

394
00:32:01,230 --> 00:32:03,130
So in this world,

395
00:32:03,590 --> 00:32:04,750
the scariest thing

396
00:32:05,920 --> 00:32:07,510
is to get used to something.

397
00:32:09,570 --> 00:32:11,290
If only I could put

398
00:32:11,860 --> 00:32:14,410
what happened between me and Great Demon

399
00:32:14,780 --> 00:32:17,060
into Cheng Huang's sundial.

400
00:32:18,570 --> 00:32:19,660
This way,

401
00:32:20,830 --> 00:32:22,430
when I miss him,

402
00:32:23,840 --> 00:32:25,500
I'll have memories to look at.

403
00:32:37,110 --> 00:32:37,950
The sundial.

404
00:32:43,490 --> 00:32:44,450
The sundial?

405
00:32:45,160 --> 00:32:45,830
Yes.

406
00:32:50,330 --> 00:32:51,470
In that case,

407
00:32:51,710 --> 00:32:53,970
the sundial can not only store memories,

408
00:32:54,470 --> 00:32:55,950
but also stop time.

409
00:32:56,780 --> 00:32:57,830
That's right.

410
00:32:59,340 --> 00:33:00,680
So if someone

411
00:33:00,950 --> 00:33:02,190
brings the branches of the Divine Wood

412
00:33:02,190 --> 00:33:03,710
into the Time Valley,

413
00:33:03,870 --> 00:33:06,050
waits for the Divine Wood to bloom,

414
00:33:06,150 --> 00:33:07,630
takes its branches down

415
00:33:08,030 --> 00:33:09,700
300 years later

416
00:33:09,880 --> 00:33:11,710
and takes them out of the Time Valley,

417
00:33:11,710 --> 00:33:13,910
the Baize Token can be repaired, right?

418
00:33:15,920 --> 00:33:17,190
Mr. Lu Wu.

419
00:33:17,350 --> 00:33:18,790
Is this method feasible?

420
00:33:19,750 --> 00:33:20,550
Yes.

421
00:33:22,070 --> 00:33:25,170
But I must remind you, Goddess.

422
00:33:25,510 --> 00:33:26,790
When time stops,

423
00:33:26,810 --> 00:33:28,270
days will wear on like years.

424
00:33:28,270 --> 00:33:29,990
It'll be like an infinite torment.

425
00:33:29,990 --> 00:33:31,420
As for the hardship it brings,

426
00:33:31,420 --> 00:33:33,440
you must think it through.

427
00:33:44,810 --> 00:33:45,910
But

428
00:33:45,940 --> 00:33:48,400
hasn't the sundial already been destroyed?

429
00:33:52,450 --> 00:33:53,680
The one that was destroyed

430
00:33:53,680 --> 00:33:54,870
was just a paperweight

431
00:33:54,870 --> 00:33:56,760
I accidentally took from your room.

432
00:33:56,760 --> 00:33:59,060
I still have the real sundial.

433
00:34:18,489 --> 00:34:19,210
Wow.

434
00:34:21,940 --> 00:34:23,219
Impressive.

435
00:34:24,060 --> 00:34:25,610
Don't worry, Goddess.

436
00:34:26,100 --> 00:34:27,090
I will

437
00:34:27,120 --> 00:34:28,070
always be here.

438
00:34:30,210 --> 00:34:31,270
Sister Wen.

439
00:34:31,690 --> 00:34:32,400
Take care.

440
00:34:42,909 --> 00:34:44,170
I'll wait for you here.

441
00:35:52,430 --> 00:35:52,990
Hey.

442
00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:54,240
How much longer

443
00:35:54,310 --> 00:35:55,640
do you think it'll take?

444
00:35:56,500 --> 00:35:56,990
Well.

445
00:35:57,520 --> 00:35:58,540
It should be soon.

446
00:36:18,610 --> 00:36:19,030
Hey.

447
00:36:19,030 --> 00:36:19,670
She's out.

448
00:36:24,510 --> 00:36:25,580
Sister Wen.

449
00:36:26,620 --> 00:36:27,760
How are you?

450
00:36:27,810 --> 00:36:28,880
Was it tough?

451
00:36:33,330 --> 00:36:34,760
300 years.

452
00:36:35,830 --> 00:36:37,250
It was indeed tough.

453
00:36:39,480 --> 00:36:42,580
I finally understood

454
00:36:43,030 --> 00:36:45,830
what Mountain God Lu Wu meant by infinite torment.

455
00:36:50,370 --> 00:36:51,540
But fortunately,

456
00:36:51,630 --> 00:36:52,950
I got it.

457
00:36:53,390 --> 00:36:54,380
Great.

458
00:36:54,470 --> 00:36:56,330
We can repair the Baize Token now.

459
00:36:56,470 --> 00:36:57,250
Letâ€™s go.

460
00:36:57,320 --> 00:36:58,550
Let's go save Great Demon right away.

461
00:36:58,550 --> 00:37:00,490
Mr. Zhuo has been on the road for most of the day.

462
00:37:00,490 --> 00:37:02,210
Can we still make it?

463
00:37:02,240 --> 00:37:03,600
Yes.

464
00:37:04,100 --> 00:37:05,430
Actually, Zhuo and I

465
00:37:05,990 --> 00:37:07,280
have made a plan.

466
00:37:14,740 --> 00:37:16,130
What is this?

467
00:37:16,430 --> 00:37:18,460
This is the Soul Trapping Needle

468
00:37:18,990 --> 00:37:20,250
Jiu gave me last night.

469
00:37:21,590 --> 00:37:22,550
Jiu said

470
00:37:22,980 --> 00:37:24,080
this silver needle

471
00:37:24,140 --> 00:37:25,880
was soaked

472
00:37:25,980 --> 00:37:26,950
in the suspended animation decoction

473
00:37:26,950 --> 00:37:28,480
made from Death Ginseng and Kusnezoff Monkshood Root.

474
00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:29,450
It can make people

475
00:37:29,450 --> 00:37:30,760
lose all vital signs

476
00:37:30,970 --> 00:37:33,650
and make them enter a state of suspended animation.

477
00:37:33,650 --> 00:37:35,180
Soul Trapping Needle?

478
00:37:36,110 --> 00:37:37,770
As long as we put this needle in

479
00:37:37,910 --> 00:37:39,910
between Zhao Yuanzhou's eyebrows,

480
00:37:42,200 --> 00:37:44,000
he will paralyze and faint

481
00:37:44,300 --> 00:37:46,470
and enter the state of suspended animation.

482
00:37:46,470 --> 00:37:47,270
Meanwhile,

483
00:37:47,870 --> 00:37:49,190
the malicious energy in him

484
00:37:49,190 --> 00:37:50,430
can be controlled.

485
00:37:52,110 --> 00:37:53,170
This way, we can also

486
00:37:53,170 --> 00:37:54,970
give King Xiang an explanation.

487
00:37:59,180 --> 00:38:01,110
After the Baize Token is repaired,

488
00:38:01,440 --> 00:38:03,080
we can take this needle out

489
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:05,620
and awaken Zhao Yuanzhou.

490
00:38:13,210 --> 00:38:14,670
Jiu is really thoughtful.

491
00:38:16,470 --> 00:38:17,490
Zhuo.

492
00:38:20,710 --> 00:38:21,800
You too.

493
00:38:32,680 --> 00:38:34,220
That's great.

494
00:38:34,750 --> 00:38:36,940
It's lucky that you and Mr. Zhuo had a discussion.

495
00:38:36,940 --> 00:38:39,280
When I bid farewell to Mr. Zhuo,

496
00:38:39,550 --> 00:38:40,670
I was so sad.

497
00:38:42,980 --> 00:38:44,190
Sister Wen.

498
00:38:44,390 --> 00:38:45,920
What are you talking about?

499
00:38:46,380 --> 00:38:47,730
Soul Trapping Needle?

500
00:38:48,350 --> 00:38:49,490
What Soul Trapping Needle?

501
00:38:49,490 --> 00:38:51,920
I've been sleeping at home last night.

502
00:38:52,030 --> 00:38:53,690
I never went to see Mr. Zhuo,

503
00:38:53,710 --> 00:38:54,630
nor did I ever develop

504
00:38:54,630 --> 00:38:55,910
that thing you said.

505
00:39:03,560 --> 00:39:05,160
There's no smell of sulphur.

506
00:39:05,490 --> 00:39:06,990
So you are the real Jiu.

507
00:39:07,590 --> 00:39:08,450
There must be something wrong

508
00:39:08,450 --> 00:39:09,810
with Mr. Zhuo.

509
00:39:09,990 --> 00:39:12,350
How could there be something wrong with Mr. Zhuo?

510
00:39:12,350 --> 00:39:13,970
You must be out of your mind.

511
00:39:13,990 --> 00:39:15,190
Wake up.

512
00:39:15,190 --> 00:39:16,510
Wake up. Think about it.

513
00:39:16,510 --> 00:39:17,960
When we were chasing Ao Yin,

514
00:39:17,960 --> 00:39:18,950
she had already been poisoned

515
00:39:18,950 --> 00:39:20,020
by the Huanling Powder mixed with Kusnezoff Monkshood Root.

516
00:39:20,020 --> 00:39:20,990
Her speed had already been reduced.

517
00:39:20,990 --> 00:39:23,390
What did that brat spray on me?

518
00:39:23,390 --> 00:39:25,060
Why am I so slow?

519
00:39:25,320 --> 00:39:26,910
Given how agile Mr. Zhuo is,

520
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:29,110
he shouldn't have failed to catch her.

521
00:39:29,110 --> 00:39:29,970
Where is Ao Yin?

522
00:39:31,760 --> 00:39:33,160
She got away.

523
00:39:35,450 --> 00:39:37,840
It does seem a bit strange.

524
00:39:40,330 --> 00:39:42,820
Ao Yin pretended to be me and killed the Prime Minister.

525
00:39:42,820 --> 00:39:45,420
I always felt that she must have taken orders from someone.

526
00:39:45,420 --> 00:39:46,850
Our guess is

527
00:39:47,040 --> 00:39:49,100
Ao Yin answers to Li Lun.

528
00:39:50,130 --> 00:39:51,050
Could it be...

529
00:39:52,620 --> 00:39:53,280
Yes.

530
00:39:57,570 --> 00:39:59,060
You mean

531
00:40:00,320 --> 00:40:01,890
Li Lun is not dead?

532
00:40:04,120 --> 00:40:05,770
Where would he be?

533
00:40:07,830 --> 00:40:09,020
He might be

534
00:40:09,590 --> 00:40:11,680
possessing someone right now.
