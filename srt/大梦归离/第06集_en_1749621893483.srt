1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,960
Let's try...

2
00:00:06,860 --> 00:00:10,960
Come on, ý...

3
00:00:11,700 --> 00:00:15,900
I...

4
00:00:16,040 --> 00:00:21,120
just leveled up the higher map point I wanted...

5
00:00:21,120 --> 00:00:26,120
I'm sorry, but I'm not sure if I can get the money back.

6
00:00:26,120 --> 00:00:31,120
I'm sorry, but I'm not sure if I can get the money back.

7
00:00:31,120 --> 00:00:36,120
I'm sorry, but I'm not sure if I can get the money back.

8
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:41,120
I'm sorry, but I'm not sure if I can get the money back.

9
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:46,120
I'm sorry, but I'm not sure if I can get the money back.

10
00:00:46,120 --> 00:00:51,120
I'm sorry, but I'm not sure if I can get the money back.

11
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:56,120
I'm sorry, but I'm not sure if I can get the money back.

12
00:00:56,120 --> 00:01:01,120
I'm sorry, but I'm not sure if I can get the money back.

13
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:06,120
I'm sorry, but I'm not sure if I can get the money back.

14
00:01:06,120 --> 00:01:11,120
I'm sorry, but I'm not sure if I can get the money back.

15
00:01:11,120 --> 00:01:16,120
I'm sorry, but I'm not sure if I can get the money back.

16
00:01:16,120 --> 00:01:21,120
I'm sorry, but I'm not sure if I can get the money back.

17
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:26,120
I'm sorry, but I'm not sure if I can get the money back.

18
00:01:26,120 --> 00:01:31,120
I'm sorry, but I'm not sure if I can get the money back.

19
00:01:31,120 --> 00:01:36,120
I'm sorry, but I'm not sure if I can get the money back.

20
00:01:36,120 --> 00:01:41,120
I'm sorry, but I'm not sure if I can get the money back.

21
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:12,120
Ruoyin, I still like to face you and chat with you.

22
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:28,120
Zhao Yanzhou, our game has just started.

23
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:41,120
It's you.

24
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:11,120
Are you okay?

25
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:17,120
What are you doing?

26
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:19,120
I was just trying to save you.

27
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:23,120
Did I let you save me?

28
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:26,120
I can't die anyway.

29
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:31,120
It's nothing to be proud of.

30
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:36,120
What's wrong?

31
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:40,120
Who is he?

32
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:45,120
A white thunder that can't be seen.

33
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:55,120
What's wrong with Ran Yi?

34
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:58,120
Ran Yi was controlled by the power.

35
00:03:58,120 --> 00:04:03,120
The weak demon is controlled by the strong demon.

36
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:11,120
Ruoyin, your friends are getting worse and worse.

37
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:17,120
The people who used to come here are the god and the god.

38
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:23,120
Now, you can't even get rid of these dirty things.

39
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:32,120
Don't you know that he and Zhao Wen'er are like siblings.

40
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:39,120
Zhao Wen'er even gave his brother Zhao Yanzhou's name to him.

41
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:45,120
Ruoyin, am I right?

42
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:49,120
One is the noble white thunder,

43
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:54,120
and the other is the evil big demon, Zhu Yan.

44
00:04:54,120 --> 00:05:00,120
Because he doesn't want others to know that they are not related.

45
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:05,120
So every time he's with Zhao Wen'er,

46
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:10,120
he takes the mask.

47
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:17,120
It's really you.

48
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:24,120
I don't know what to do.

49
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:29,120
I just want to be with you.

50
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:34,120
I want you to be with me.

51
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:39,120
I just want to be with you.

52
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:44,120
I just want to be with you.

53
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:50,120
Ruoyin, your blood is so ugly.

54
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:53,120
Don't you want to give up?

55
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:56,120
Although he's not that good,

56
00:05:56,120 --> 00:06:01,120
your brother is the one who killed him.

57
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:07,120
If your brother sees you and your enemy fighting together,

58
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:15,120
how can you be at ease under the blood of the nine realms?

59
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:20,120
I can't kill him.

60
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:23,120
You can.

61
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:27,120
With my help,

62
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:34,120
you can.

63
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:41,120
Good.

64
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:59,120
vanish in haste.

65
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:01,120
I will kill you, of course.

66
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:03,920
But first, I need to get rid of you,

67
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:05,920
the evilest thing.

68
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:08,920
If you kill me,

69
00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:13,520
no one will know where Bai Ze Ling is.

70
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:15,520
You know where Bai Ze Ling is?

71
00:07:17,320 --> 00:07:19,520
The night when Zhou Wen'er died,

72
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:22,320
I was sealed.

73
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:25,520
The only one who woke up on the scene.

74
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:28,520
Naturally, I saw where Bai Ze Ling is.

75
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:30,720
Where?

76
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:35,720
On you.

77
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:42,520
You just saw it in your dream.

78
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:44,720
Right?

79
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:55,720
But now you only have half of Bai Ze Ling.

80
00:07:56,920 --> 00:07:58,920
So you can't show up.

81
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:01,120
What about the other half?

82
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:03,720
Do you want to know?

83
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:10,120
But I don't want to say it.

84
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:14,120
You have to say it if you don't want to.

85
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:35,520
Excessive Sky Всем

86
00:08:42,520 --> 00:08:45,040
Excessive Sky clinics bringen no use to them.

87
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:53,320
Really?

88
00:08:59,120 --> 00:08:59,920
Der, der.

89
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:01,920
Der.

90
00:09:02,460 --> 00:09:04,220
Der.

91
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:05,360
Der, der.

92
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:08,000
Golf afraid no securely.

93
00:09:09,380 --> 00:09:10,080
He ...

94
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:18,660
He ran away so long,

95
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:24,060
to let him meet theelly come three days?

96
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:29,800
Yes.

97
00:09:37,880 --> 00:09:38,480
Z Mallord...

98
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:02,480
Jackie...

99
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:28,320
Xiaoshan.

100
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:30,320
Why are you still practicing sword?

101
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:32,320
I want to practice sword skills well.

102
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:35,320
I want to help brother and brother in the future.

103
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:40,320
This Shang Si Jie is not so fun.

104
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:45,320
I still remember when you were seven years old.

105
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:48,320
You cried and came to me to cry.

106
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:52,320
You cried and others didn't want to play with you.

107
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:55,320
Because your father, brother and brother,

108
00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:57,320
were all monsters.

109
00:10:57,320 --> 00:11:00,320
You and the monster were taught that one day,

110
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:03,320
you will become a monster.

111
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:07,320
Brother,

112
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:09,320
I was a little kid.

113
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:12,320
You still remember what I said.

114
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:15,320
But after so many years,

115
00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:19,320
I didn't call any friends.

116
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:22,320
I was always alone.

117
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:24,320
Brother,

118
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:28,320
did I

119
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:33,320
turn myself into a monster?

120
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:37,320
The so-called monster

121
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:39,320
is just a person who is narrow-minded,

122
00:11:39,320 --> 00:11:41,320
to warm up the group,

123
00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:44,320
suppress and attack others' words.

124
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:46,320
I'm not a monster.

125
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:49,320
I'm just a person who is not a monster.

126
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:51,320
I'm just a person who is warm,

127
00:11:51,320 --> 00:11:53,320
to warm up the group,

128
00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:55,320
suppress and attack others' words.

129
00:11:55,320 --> 00:11:58,320
They are here to show their true colors,

130
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:01,320
to cover up the inside.

131
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:03,320
Brother,

132
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:07,320
we have been in different situations since we were born.

133
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:11,320
So we have to bear the pain of not having anyone.

134
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:14,320
Brother,

135
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:17,320
are you also that kind of person?

136
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:26,320
Do you know how to be lonely?

137
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:30,320
Maybe one day,

138
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:35,320
you will meet someone who is a monster.

139
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:39,320
Then you need to make your own decision.

140
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:42,320
Your eyes will deceive people.

141
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:46,320
But your heart will tell you the answer.

142
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:52,320
I believe that Xiao Chen

143
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:55,320
will meet a group of friends who are the same.

144
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:59,320
When that happens, you won't be lonely.

145
00:13:03,320 --> 00:13:05,320
Will you?

146
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:08,320
I will.

147
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:11,320
Remember,

148
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:14,320
you will be lonely and lonely.

149
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:17,320
You will be a good person.

150
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:38,700
The

151
00:13:58,320 --> 00:13:58,680
ales

152
00:14:01,860 --> 00:14:03,320
lad.

153
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:40,320
Xiao Zhuo!

154
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:43,320
Xiao Zhuo! Xiao Zhuo!

155
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:10,320
Xiao Zhuo! Xiao Zhuo!

156
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:41,320
Wen Shang!

157
00:16:09,320 --> 00:16:11,320
Xiao Zhuo! Xiao Zhuo!

158
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:17,320
Zhu Yichen!

159
00:16:17,320 --> 00:16:19,320
You're a monster!

160
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:21,320
Cloud Sword.

161
00:16:21,320 --> 00:16:22,320
The monster is broken.

162
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:24,320
It's not destroyed by the evil.

163
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:26,320
It can break all the power of the world.

164
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:40,320
It's not working.

165
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:44,320
Because it has never been the nightmare of its own.

166
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:48,320
For so many years,

167
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:50,320
it has never been a dream.

168
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:54,320
So it can't be separated from the dream.

169
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:56,320
It's not a dream.

170
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:58,320
It's not a dream.

171
00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:00,320
It's not a dream.

172
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:02,320
It's not a dream.

173
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:04,320
It's not a dream.

174
00:17:04,320 --> 00:17:06,320
It's not a dream.

175
00:17:06,320 --> 00:17:09,320
It's true after the separation.

176
00:17:12,320 --> 00:17:14,320
It can't wake up.

177
00:17:16,320 --> 00:17:18,320
Xiao Zhuo!

178
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:08,320
I'm not sure if I can do it.

179
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:10,320
I'm not sure if I can do it.

180
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:12,320
I'm not sure if I can do it.

181
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:14,320
I'm not sure if I can do it.

182
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:16,320
I'm not sure if I can do it.

183
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:18,320
I'm not sure if I can do it.

184
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:20,320
I'm not sure if I can do it.

185
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:22,320
I'm not sure if I can do it.

186
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:24,320
I'm not sure if I can do it.

187
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:26,320
I'm not sure if I can do it.

188
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:28,320
I'm not sure if I can do it.

189
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:30,320
I'm not sure if I can do it.

190
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:32,320
I'm not sure if I can do it.

191
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:34,320
I'm not sure if I can do it.

192
00:18:35,320 --> 00:18:37,320
ha ha ha ha

193
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:40,760
Yuira

194
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:44,640
If I'm your nightmare

195
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:51,320
Don't touch me.

196
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:06,120
If it doesn't look so sad,

197
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:08,260
we will ROAR together.

198
00:19:09,920 --> 00:19:11,380

213
00:19:46,180 --> 00:19:48,820
disguise

214
00:19:48,820 --> 00:19:52,120
Because i was afraid I achieved my dream

215
00:19:52,120 --> 00:19:53,740
I didn't have a dream

216
00:19:56,700 --> 00:19:59,360
So every time i killed my brother

217
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:01,120
I had no dream

218
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:06,120
I... I want to fight him.

219
00:20:08,120 --> 00:20:10,120
I want to keep on escaping.

220
00:20:12,120 --> 00:20:14,120
I want to keep on saying that I'm the one.

221
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:30,120
My nightmare is myself!

222
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:35,120
I have lost my regret.

223
00:20:36,120 --> 00:20:39,120
Enough is enough...

224
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:47,120
I prefer to hold back my self.

225
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:57,120
I'm still supposed to be a возь ma fryfaah anymore.

226
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:02,220
Come here.

227
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:05,680
There is no need to join hands

228
00:21:13,980 --> 00:21:16,440
Sasha

229
00:21:20,980 --> 00:21:22,780
I have nothing ahead of me

230
00:21:22,780 --> 00:21:26,440
I will be equipped

231
00:21:26,680 --> 00:21:28,900
at the far Wisconsin

232
00:21:28,900 --> 00:21:30,700
You make me like those girls

233
00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:41,760
I'm useless

234
00:21:58,900 --> 00:22:00,900
Ranyi

235
00:22:03,900 --> 00:22:04,900
Ranyi

236
00:22:04,900 --> 00:22:05,900
Ranyi

237
00:22:10,900 --> 00:22:11,900
Ranyi

238
00:22:15,900 --> 00:22:17,900
Ji Chenqian

239
00:22:17,900 --> 00:22:19,900
Ranyi

240
00:22:22,900 --> 00:22:23,900
No

241
00:22:23,900 --> 00:22:25,900
Ranyi

242
00:22:54,900 --> 00:22:56,900
Ji Chenqian

243
00:22:57,900 --> 00:22:59,900
Ji Chenqian

244
00:22:59,900 --> 00:23:01,900
Ranyi

245
00:23:01,900 --> 00:23:03,900
Ranyi

246
00:23:23,900 --> 00:23:25,900
Ranyi

247
00:23:48,900 --> 00:23:49,900
Ranyi

248
00:23:50,900 --> 00:23:51,900
Ranyi

249
00:23:52,900 --> 00:23:53,900
Do you still remember

250
00:23:55,900 --> 00:23:58,900
when we first met?

251
00:23:59,900 --> 00:24:00,900
Someone told master

252
00:24:00,900 --> 00:24:01,900
that someone took Xia Ning

253
00:24:01,900 --> 00:24:02,900
to find a famous doctor

254
00:24:02,900 --> 00:24:03,900
to tell her

255
00:24:03,900 --> 00:24:05,900
that she can cure Miss's disease

256
00:24:05,900 --> 00:24:06,900
but she

257
00:24:06,900 --> 00:24:08,900
she is a little strange

258
00:24:19,900 --> 00:24:21,900
Ranyi

259
00:24:31,900 --> 00:24:33,900
When we first met

260
00:24:34,900 --> 00:24:35,900
you used your cloth

261
00:24:35,900 --> 00:24:37,900
to cover your face

262
00:24:38,900 --> 00:24:40,900
and only show your eyes

263
00:24:43,900 --> 00:24:45,900
But I will remember

264
00:24:46,900 --> 00:24:47,900
those eyes

265
00:24:49,900 --> 00:24:50,900
are like

266
00:24:50,900 --> 00:24:53,900
a drop of water

267
00:24:53,900 --> 00:24:55,900
It's so beautiful

268
00:24:59,900 --> 00:25:00,900
I

269
00:25:03,900 --> 00:25:05,900
It's not the first time

270
00:25:05,900 --> 00:25:17,900
Miss

271
00:25:18,900 --> 00:25:20,900
Why do you come to the lake?

272
00:25:23,900 --> 00:25:24,900
The book says

273
00:25:25,900 --> 00:25:27,900
the sea of Baichuan

274
00:25:27,900 --> 00:25:29,900
and the water is back to the abyss

275
00:25:31,900 --> 00:25:33,900
But look at this lake

276
00:25:34,900 --> 00:25:36,900
It's always in the forest

277
00:25:37,900 --> 00:25:39,900
Do you think it can return to the sea?

278
00:25:44,900 --> 00:25:45,900
Who saw it?

279
00:25:50,900 --> 00:25:52,900
I was chased by the demon

280
00:25:52,900 --> 00:25:54,900
I was badly injured

281
00:25:54,900 --> 00:25:56,900
I was left with no one to protect me

282
00:25:58,900 --> 00:25:59,900
I saw you

283
00:26:00,900 --> 00:26:02,900
under the protection of the emperor

284
00:26:04,900 --> 00:26:05,900
I

285
00:26:16,900 --> 00:26:18,900
I used all my strength

286
00:26:19,900 --> 00:26:20,900
to open my eyes

287
00:26:20,900 --> 00:26:21,900
to see your look

288
00:26:23,900 --> 00:26:25,900
Just like the god of play in the legend

289
00:26:26,900 --> 00:26:28,900
his eyes are gentle

290
00:26:28,900 --> 00:26:29,900
and charming

291
00:26:30,900 --> 00:26:31,900
Let's go

292
00:26:33,900 --> 00:26:35,900
Zong'er.

293
00:26:38,900 --> 00:26:41,900
I told myself at that time.

294
00:26:42,900 --> 00:26:44,900
I must see you again.

295
00:26:46,900 --> 00:26:48,900
You've been to so many places.

296
00:26:48,900 --> 00:26:51,900
You should have seen many people who were in a state of shock.

297
00:26:55,900 --> 00:26:57,900
You're so stupid.

298
00:26:58,900 --> 00:27:00,900
Actually, you're better than me.

299
00:27:00,900 --> 00:27:04,900
You're old now, but you still don't want to leave.

300
00:27:06,900 --> 00:27:09,900
You can stay in the world,

301
00:27:10,900 --> 00:27:12,900
but you have to stay with me,

302
00:27:13,900 --> 00:27:15,900
in this dead end.

303
00:27:31,900 --> 00:27:33,900
You're so busy.

304
00:27:34,900 --> 00:27:36,900
You're so helpless.

305
00:27:37,900 --> 00:27:39,900
You're in the world.

306
00:27:43,900 --> 00:27:46,900
I've always been in your mind.

307
00:27:47,900 --> 00:27:50,900
You want to see her smile.

308
00:27:50,900 --> 00:27:53,900
You want to experience her life.

309
00:27:54,900 --> 00:27:56,900
You want to see her smile.

310
00:27:56,900 --> 00:27:59,900
You want to experience her life.

311
00:28:00,900 --> 00:28:02,900
So from that time on,

312
00:28:04,900 --> 00:28:07,900
I'll make a dream for you every night.

313
00:28:08,900 --> 00:28:10,900
I'll make you realize the wish of the world

314
00:28:10,900 --> 00:28:14,900
trapped in the high wall of the god.

315
00:28:27,900 --> 00:28:29,900
I've always been with you.

316
00:28:30,900 --> 00:28:32,900
Even if you leave me,

317
00:28:32,900 --> 00:28:35,900
I'll only make a small rain in your bathhouse.

318
00:28:38,900 --> 00:28:42,900
But the dream is a magic.

319
00:28:43,900 --> 00:28:45,900
The longer I dream of you,

320
00:28:45,900 --> 00:28:47,900
the weaker I'll be.

321
00:28:47,900 --> 00:28:49,900
I can't dream of you anymore.

322
00:28:49,900 --> 00:28:50,900
Master,

323
00:28:50,900 --> 00:28:53,900
you're still not well.

324
00:28:53,900 --> 00:28:55,900
You're still not well.

325
00:28:55,900 --> 00:28:58,900
Recently, you can't get out of bed.

326
00:29:00,900 --> 00:29:02,900
So I'll become a doctor

327
00:29:02,900 --> 00:29:04,900
and stay by your side.

328
00:29:06,900 --> 00:29:08,900
I'll paint you a painting,

329
00:29:09,900 --> 00:29:10,900
a body,

330
00:29:11,900 --> 00:29:13,900
a book,

331
00:29:14,900 --> 00:29:16,900
and a big world outside.

332
00:29:17,900 --> 00:29:19,900
My favorite word is

333
00:29:20,900 --> 00:29:22,900
the dream is true.

334
00:29:25,900 --> 00:29:27,900
When I think about it,

335
00:29:29,900 --> 00:29:31,900
I feel so happy.

336
00:29:34,900 --> 00:29:37,900
Whether you're human or medicine,

337
00:29:40,900 --> 00:29:42,900
it's all my way to the end

338
00:29:43,900 --> 00:29:45,900
and the end.

339
00:29:49,900 --> 00:29:51,900
I've never regretted

340
00:29:51,900 --> 00:29:53,900
meeting you

341
00:29:55,900 --> 00:29:57,900
and being the happiest thing in my life.

342
00:29:59,900 --> 00:30:01,900
Thank you

343
00:30:02,900 --> 00:30:04,900
for giving me the best dream.

344
00:30:07,900 --> 00:30:09,900
I'll hurt you

345
00:30:09,900 --> 00:30:11,900
when I wake up.

346
00:30:13,900 --> 00:30:15,900
I'm not talking about those dreams.

347
00:30:19,900 --> 00:30:21,900
I'm talking about

348
00:30:22,900 --> 00:30:24,900
the moment.

349
00:31:20,900 --> 00:31:22,900
I'm burning myself.

350
00:31:28,900 --> 00:31:30,900
She's gone.

351
00:31:38,900 --> 00:31:40,900
You once said

352
00:31:41,900 --> 00:31:43,900
you'd take me to the Great Wall

353
00:31:43,900 --> 00:31:45,900
to return to your hometown.

354
00:31:45,900 --> 00:31:47,900
I'll take you to the Heaven's Book

355
00:31:47,900 --> 00:31:49,900
to see if you can cure me.

356
00:32:15,900 --> 00:32:18,900
The End

357
00:32:37,900 --> 00:32:39,900
Master said

358
00:32:39,900 --> 00:32:41,900
death is

359
00:32:41,900 --> 00:32:43,900
a person

360
00:32:43,900 --> 00:32:46,900
who goes to a far, far away place.

361
00:32:49,900 --> 00:32:51,900
He won't come back.

362
00:33:14,900 --> 00:33:16,900
But my other friend told me

363
00:33:17,900 --> 00:33:19,900
the dead person

364
00:33:19,900 --> 00:33:21,900
would become the star in the sky.

365
00:33:24,900 --> 00:33:26,900
He told me

366
00:33:27,900 --> 00:33:29,900
don't be sad about the past.

367
00:33:31,900 --> 00:33:34,900
Don't be sad about the things that can't be reversed.

368
00:33:36,900 --> 00:33:38,900
I'll have all the power

369
00:33:39,900 --> 00:33:42,900
to touch the things you can strive for.

370
00:33:43,900 --> 00:33:45,900
I'll cherish them.

371
00:33:56,900 --> 00:33:57,900
Go.

372
00:33:57,900 --> 00:33:59,900
Don't come back if you're leaving.

373
00:34:09,900 --> 00:34:10,900
In the end,

374
00:34:10,900 --> 00:34:12,900
no one can change you.

375
00:34:13,900 --> 00:34:15,900
Like the dead person,

376
00:34:16,900 --> 00:34:18,900
like fate.

377
00:34:18,900 --> 00:34:20,900
Can't fate change?

378
00:34:23,900 --> 00:34:25,900
Do you believe in fate?

379
00:34:26,900 --> 00:34:28,900
What I want to destroy

380
00:34:29,900 --> 00:34:32,900
is what God and Queen decide to protect.

381
00:34:33,900 --> 00:34:35,900
It's not fate.

382
00:34:36,900 --> 00:34:38,900
It's my retribution.

383
00:34:41,900 --> 00:34:43,900
I know I can't persuade you,

384
00:34:44,900 --> 00:34:46,900
but I believe

385
00:34:46,900 --> 00:34:47,900
one day

386
00:34:47,900 --> 00:34:50,900
you'll meet the one who wants you to live.

387
00:34:56,900 --> 00:34:58,900
He said yes,

388
00:34:58,900 --> 00:35:00,900
but I don't think so.

389
00:35:01,900 --> 00:35:03,900
What about you?

390
00:35:05,900 --> 00:35:07,900
Will you die?

391
00:35:10,900 --> 00:35:12,900
I will.

392
00:35:37,900 --> 00:35:39,900
But don't worry.

393
00:35:39,900 --> 00:35:41,900
I won't die.

394
00:35:42,900 --> 00:35:44,900
I'll be by your side.

395
00:35:46,900 --> 00:35:48,900
I won't leave you

396
00:35:49,900 --> 00:35:51,900
for long.

397
00:36:09,900 --> 00:36:11,900
I'll be by your side.

398
00:36:26,900 --> 00:36:28,900
I'm a genius.

399
00:36:28,900 --> 00:36:30,900
I'm a genius.

400
00:36:30,900 --> 00:36:32,900
I'm a genius.

401
00:36:33,900 --> 00:36:35,900
I'm a genius.

402
00:36:35,900 --> 00:36:37,900
I'm a genius.

403
00:36:37,900 --> 00:36:40,900
Lord Zhuo has successfully destroyed the water ghost.

404
00:36:40,900 --> 00:36:42,900
The military command is successfully completed.

405
00:36:42,900 --> 00:36:44,900
Lord Fan told me to tell you,

406
00:36:44,900 --> 00:36:45,900
don't worry.

407
00:36:45,900 --> 00:36:47,900
Go straight.

408
00:36:49,900 --> 00:36:51,900
Lord Bai, be careful.

409
00:37:01,900 --> 00:37:02,900
Lord Bai,

410
00:37:02,900 --> 00:37:04,900
why do you bring so many bottles?

411
00:37:08,900 --> 00:37:11,900
I've got 30 heads of Jiao Si.

412
00:37:12,900 --> 00:37:14,900
But

413
00:37:15,900 --> 00:37:17,900
I have to keep them.

414
00:37:20,900 --> 00:37:23,900
At least they're happy.

415
00:37:24,900 --> 00:37:26,900
Is happiness important?

416
00:37:27,900 --> 00:37:29,900
Of course.

417
00:37:30,900 --> 00:37:32,900
Even if it's not important,

418
00:37:33,900 --> 00:37:35,900
I'll be by your side.

419
00:37:35,900 --> 00:37:37,900
Is happiness important?

420
00:37:38,900 --> 00:37:40,900
You're a demon.

421
00:37:43,900 --> 00:37:45,900
I'm a demon.

422
00:37:46,900 --> 00:37:49,900
So I know happiness is not important.

423
00:37:51,900 --> 00:37:53,900
Because every emotion of a person

424
00:37:54,900 --> 00:37:56,900
is important.

425
00:37:57,900 --> 00:38:00,900
Happiness is not a change.

426
00:38:01,900 --> 00:38:03,900
The tragedy is a long river.

427
00:38:04,900 --> 00:38:06,900
It's called a long river.

428
00:38:07,900 --> 00:38:09,900
It's called life.

429
00:38:11,900 --> 00:38:13,900
Do you know?

430
00:38:14,900 --> 00:38:16,900
Any emotion

431
00:38:16,900 --> 00:38:18,900
is a hundred years

432
00:38:18,900 --> 00:38:20,900
to be fixed.

433
00:38:20,900 --> 00:38:22,900
Only a thousand years

434
00:38:22,900 --> 00:38:24,900
can make you understand.

435
00:38:25,900 --> 00:38:27,900
No matter how many drugs,

436
00:38:27,900 --> 00:38:29,900
no matter how many doctors,

437
00:38:29,900 --> 00:38:31,900
you can't keep a single tear.

438
00:38:33,900 --> 00:38:35,900
So,

439
00:38:36,900 --> 00:38:39,900
don't make everyone happy anymore.

440
00:38:46,900 --> 00:38:48,900
You're still so weak.

441
00:38:49,900 --> 00:38:51,900
You're very nervous.

442
00:38:57,900 --> 00:38:58,900
Of course.

443
00:38:59,900 --> 00:39:01,900
This kind of nervousness

444
00:39:01,900 --> 00:39:03,900
is very important to you.

445
00:39:04,900 --> 00:39:06,900
It's very important.

446
00:39:11,900 --> 00:39:12,900
Yes.

447
00:39:13,900 --> 00:39:15,900
That's because you don't know me.

448
00:39:15,900 --> 00:39:17,900
You're so busy

449
00:39:17,900 --> 00:39:19,900
with me.

450
00:39:20,900 --> 00:39:22,900
It's also very important.

451
00:39:22,900 --> 00:39:24,900
I'm sorry.

452
00:39:30,900 --> 00:39:32,900
Zhao Yunzhe.

453
00:39:34,900 --> 00:39:36,900
You're not a friend.

454
00:39:38,900 --> 00:39:40,900
Which friend?

455
00:39:41,900 --> 00:39:43,900
Is it a friendship

456
00:39:44,900 --> 00:39:46,900
or a relationship?

457
00:39:47,900 --> 00:39:49,900
You said

458
00:39:50,900 --> 00:39:52,900
you came to me.

459
00:40:01,900 --> 00:40:02,900
Da Yao.

460
00:40:03,900 --> 00:40:05,900
Where are you taking me?

461
00:40:05,900 --> 00:40:07,900
Tian Du.

462
00:40:07,900 --> 00:40:09,900
Don't you go to take care of me?

463
00:40:11,900 --> 00:40:13,900
I will come to you.

464
00:40:19,900 --> 00:40:21,900
I will come to you.

465
00:40:39,900 --> 00:40:42,900
I'm here to see you, right?

466
00:40:44,900 --> 00:40:45,900
But you...

467
00:40:46,900 --> 00:40:48,900
Why don't you tell me who you are?

468
00:40:50,900 --> 00:40:53,900
Just pretend that

469
00:41:00,900 --> 00:41:02,900
you know me again.

470
00:41:02,900 --> 00:41:04,900
I'm here to see you.

471
00:41:18,900 --> 00:41:20,900
I will come to you.

472
00:41:32,900 --> 00:41:34,900
I will come to you.

473
00:41:34,900 --> 00:41:36,900
I will come to you.

474
00:41:43,900 --> 00:41:45,900
The contract under the blood of the demon

475
00:41:45,900 --> 00:41:47,900
is as weak as a cup.

476
00:41:47,900 --> 00:41:49,900
It's not broken.

477
00:41:49,900 --> 00:41:51,900
I'm willing to keep

478
00:41:51,900 --> 00:41:53,900
the friendship between us

479
00:41:53,900 --> 00:41:55,900
for a year.

480
00:41:55,900 --> 00:41:56,900
Remember that.

481
00:41:56,900 --> 00:41:58,900
This is the most important one.

482
00:41:59,900 --> 00:42:01,900
Zhao Yunzhe.

483
00:42:02,900 --> 00:42:04,900
Zhao Yunzhe.

484
00:42:04,900 --> 00:42:06,900
Zhao Yunzhe.

485
00:42:32,900 --> 00:42:34,900
Zhao Yunzhe.

486
00:42:45,900 --> 00:42:47,900
Are you okay?

487
00:42:53,900 --> 00:42:55,900
I think I'm dying soon.

488
00:42:58,900 --> 00:43:00,900
Mr. Zhuo's light is really amazing.

489
00:43:02,900 --> 00:43:04,900
I want to see him.

490
00:43:15,900 --> 00:43:17,900
Are you a demon?

491
00:43:17,900 --> 00:43:19,900
Why did you die in the cold?

492
00:43:32,900 --> 00:43:34,900
I can't take it anymore.

493
00:43:34,900 --> 00:43:35,900
I'll die.

494
00:43:35,900 --> 00:43:37,900
I'll die in a small fire.

495
00:43:45,900 --> 00:43:46,900
It's okay.

496
00:43:48,900 --> 00:43:49,900
I've been living too long.

497
00:43:51,900 --> 00:43:52,900
I have some salt.

498
00:43:55,900 --> 00:43:56,900
What a coincidence.

499
00:43:58,900 --> 00:43:59,900
I have a salt.

500
00:43:59,900 --> 00:44:01,900
It's as good as a human's.

501
00:44:05,900 --> 00:44:07,900
I'm so guilty of your death.

502
00:44:08,900 --> 00:44:09,900
I should have died.

503
00:44:11,900 --> 00:44:12,900
So, Wenxiao.

504
00:44:14,900 --> 00:44:16,900
You don't have to be sad for me.

505
00:44:18,900 --> 00:44:22,900
The dead will become the stars of the sun.

506
00:44:24,900 --> 00:44:25,900
I can also become rain.

507
00:44:26,900 --> 00:44:28,900
As long as it rains,

508
00:44:32,900 --> 00:44:34,900
I'll be with you.

509
00:44:56,900 --> 00:44:58,900
Actually, I don't like rain.

510
00:45:01,900 --> 00:45:03,900
And you didn't say that

511
00:45:06,900 --> 00:45:08,900
I'll die with you.

512
00:45:10,900 --> 00:45:11,900
I won't die.

513
00:45:25,900 --> 00:45:28,900
Zhao Yuzheng, you're a bastard.

514
00:45:35,900 --> 00:45:37,900
Wei Xiao, he lied to you.

515
00:45:37,900 --> 00:45:38,900
Look.

516
00:45:56,900 --> 00:45:57,900
I'm sorry.

517
00:46:04,900 --> 00:46:07,900
Is Mr. Chou here to thank me for saving my life?

518
00:46:07,900 --> 00:46:09,900
It's a small matter.

519
00:46:09,900 --> 00:46:10,900
Don't talk about it.

520
00:46:11,900 --> 00:46:15,900
Why did you kill my brother at the beginning?

521
00:46:15,900 --> 00:46:17,900
Who said he was not guilty?

522
00:46:17,900 --> 00:46:21,900
But your brother is the one who killed him.

523
00:46:21,900 --> 00:46:22,900
What?

524
00:46:22,900 --> 00:46:24,900
The one who said he was not guilty.

525
00:46:24,900 --> 00:46:25,900
What does that mean?

526
00:46:38,900 --> 00:46:40,900
I saw it in the dream.

527
00:46:41,900 --> 00:46:43,900
He was killed by Li Qi.

528
00:46:43,900 --> 00:46:44,900
He was not guilty.

529
00:46:45,900 --> 00:46:46,900
That's why he was killed.

530
00:46:46,900 --> 00:46:47,900
I'm sorry.

531
00:46:50,900 --> 00:46:53,900
But the killer is the killer.

532
00:47:01,900 --> 00:47:05,900
There are too many deep secrets in this world.

533
00:47:07,900 --> 00:47:10,900
Someone was forced to marry because of the poor.

534
00:47:12,900 --> 00:47:15,900
Because he was forced to be a criminal.

535
00:47:16,900 --> 00:47:18,900
Because he was killed by hatred.

536
00:47:20,900 --> 00:47:22,900
But he was also killed by Mr. Qi.

537
00:47:22,900 --> 00:47:24,900
That's why he was forced to be a criminal.

538
00:47:25,900 --> 00:47:26,900
But these things

539
00:47:27,900 --> 00:47:31,900
can't be the reason for their escape.

540
00:47:31,900 --> 00:47:33,900
Mr. Chou, don't worry.

541
00:47:35,900 --> 00:47:37,900
I'll take the order back.

542
00:47:39,900 --> 00:47:41,900
I'll pay back what I owe you.

543
00:47:45,900 --> 00:47:46,900
I promise you.

544
00:47:48,900 --> 00:47:49,900
I promise you.

545
00:47:50,900 --> 00:47:51,900
I promise you.

546
00:47:52,900 --> 00:47:53,900
I promise you.

547
00:47:54,900 --> 00:47:55,900
I promise you.

548
00:47:56,900 --> 00:47:57,900
I promise you.

549
00:47:58,900 --> 00:47:59,900
I promise you.

550
00:47:59,900 --> 00:48:00,900
I promise you.

551
00:48:01,900 --> 00:48:02,900
I will do it.

552
00:48:08,900 --> 00:48:09,900
Okay.

553
00:48:10,900 --> 00:48:12,900
Your grudges will be in the future.

554
00:48:13,900 --> 00:48:15,900
We are going to meet Mr. Pei now.

555
00:48:16,900 --> 00:48:17,900
We'll go back to the capital.

556
00:48:29,900 --> 00:48:31,900
Mr. Pei

557
00:48:59,900 --> 00:49:01,900
Mr. Pei

558
00:49:29,900 --> 00:49:31,900
Mr. Pei

559
00:49:59,900 --> 00:50:01,900
Mr. Pei
