1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,020
I confused you for the part where I see this vision

2
00:00:12,500 --> 00:00:17,500
見주지 마 a Cont educated by consciousness

3
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:26,800
Everything I see in me collides with my mind

4
00:00:56,800 --> 00:01:01,800
I'm sorry, but I'm not sure if I can get the money back.

5
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:06,800
I'm sorry, but I'm not sure if I can get the money back.

6
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:11,800
I'm sorry, but I'm not sure if I can get the money back.

7
00:01:11,800 --> 00:01:16,800
I'm sorry, but I'm not sure if I can get the money back.

8
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:21,800
I'm sorry, but I'm not sure if I can get the money back.

9
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:26,800
I'm sorry, but I'm not sure if I can get the money back.

10
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:31,800
I'm sorry, but I'm not sure if I can get the money back.

11
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:36,800
I'm sorry, but I'm not sure if I can get the money back.

12
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:56,800
Help me kill Zhou Yanzhou.

13
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:03,800
Say, are you willing to do it?

14
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:07,800
I'm willing to do it.

15
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:10,800
I'm willing to do it.

16
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:20,800
Miss Diao Chong.

17
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:30,800
Where is this? We were just lying in the coffin.

18
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:42,800
Why are there so many dead people?

19
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:03,800
It's just a illusion.

20
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:04,800
It's a lie.

21
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:08,800
He just knew that I was so scared.

22
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:19,800
It should be that wind spirit.

23
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:21,800
It's lost its magic.

24
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:24,800
It can affect the nature of the mystery.

25
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:37,800
Here it comes.

26
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:40,800
Good work.

27
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:41,800
Awesome.

28
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:43,800
Awesome.

29
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:44,800
Let's go.

30
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:45,800
No.

31
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:46,800
I'm here.

32
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:48,800
Don't be scared.

33
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:50,800
If you want to kill Zhou Yanzhou, you can do it.

34
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:59,800
This is the head of the demon god.

35
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:01,800
Ling Xi is the best.

36
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:06,800
Demon god.

37
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:10,800
Demon god.

38
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:12,800
Demon god.

39
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:16,800
Don't be scared.

40
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:18,800
We are both dead.

41
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:21,800
If the demon god takes the dead person back,

42
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:24,800
isn't it just Haozi takes the cat back?

43
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:28,800
It seems that I'm not the only one who wants to kill myself.

44
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:29,800
Interesting.

45
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:33,800
This is the way to Kunlun Mountain.

46
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:36,800
Now, it's a gentle journey.

47
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:38,800
It's a demon god.

48
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:41,800
And Zhou is missing.

49
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:45,800
It seems that someone doesn't want us to go to Kunlun Mountain.

50
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:49,800
But we are going to Kunlun Mountain.

51
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:51,800
No one knows.

52
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:54,800
How could the demon be buried?

53
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:55,800
Who is so annoying?

54
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:57,800
Who wants to be the most panic?

55
00:04:57,800 --> 00:04:59,800
Who is the most panic?

56
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:02,800
Li Lun.

57
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:06,800
Come here.

58
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:08,800
Men and women are not listening.

59
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:10,800
You are dragging your lord Pei.

60
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:12,800
What are you talking about?

61
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:15,800
What are you talking about?

62
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:17,800
I'm a kid.

63
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:19,800
You are so stupid.

64
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:22,800
You are dragging your lord Pei.

65
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:24,800
He can't make it.

66
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:26,800
What if he met the demon?

67
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:28,800
He can't protect you.

68
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:30,800
Don't go to Lord Zhuo.

69
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:32,800
Who is Lord Zhuo?

70
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:34,800
Sorry, I was wrong.

71
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:36,800
You should learn more from him.

72
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:38,800
You will know the difference, right?

73
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:39,800
Sorry.

74
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:41,800
Don't waste your time.

75
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:43,800
Let's find Lord Zhuo first.

76
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:45,800
Xiao Zhuo is so ugly.

77
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:49,800
It's impossible for a normal person to catch him so easily.

78
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:54,800
Is it possible that Lord Zhuo was caught by Lord Zhuo?

79
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:57,800
He will leave clues.

80
00:05:57,800 --> 00:05:59,800
Clues? I'll take care of it.

81
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:04,800
You are not afraid now?

82
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:07,800
Ying Lei, you are a good man.

83
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:08,800
Go.

84
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:12,800
I found it.

85
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:14,800
Where is the spirit of Lord Zhuo?

86
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:15,800
We asked.

87
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:16,800
Ask around.

88
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:18,800
See if there is anything else?

89
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:20,800
This way.

90
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:21,800
Go.

91
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:22,800
This way.

92
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:24,800
I found it.

93
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:25,800
This way.

94
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:26,800
Okay.

95
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:28,800
It's still delicious.

96
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:40,800
It's gone.

97
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:42,800
It's weird.

98
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:44,800
There must be a secret passage.

99
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:46,800
Let's find it separately.

100
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:47,800
Okay.

101
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:49,800
You go there.

102
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:12,800
It's the prescription.

103
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:14,800
I'll show you.

104
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:18,800
It's a poison.

105
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:20,800
It's a poison.

106
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:22,800
The prescription of Wen Yi.

107
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:30,800
How could the prescription of Wen Yi be here?

108
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:32,800
No.

109
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:33,800
What?

110
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:34,800
What is going on?

111
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:35,800
What happened?

112
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:36,800
I'm scared.

113
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:37,800
What is going on?

114
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:38,800
It's so dark.

115
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:39,800
No.

116
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:40,800
Everything is dark.

117
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:42,800
You should see for yourself.

118
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:43,800
Okay.

119
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:48,800
It's gone.

120
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:50,800
It's gone.

121
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:51,800
It's gone.

122
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:53,800
You can see it yourself.

123
00:07:57,800 --> 00:07:58,800
It's gone.

124
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:02,800
What's wrong?

125
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:04,800
No, no, no.

126
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:06,800
Miss, please help me.

127
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:10,800
What's wrong?

128
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:12,800
Miss, there's a drug behind you.

129
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:14,800
Don't move.

130
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:22,800
There's a drug behind you.

131
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:24,800
It's too scary.

132
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:26,800
Why are you shaking?

133
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:28,800
I won't come here again.

134
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:32,800
Miss.

135
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:56,800
Your friends are here.

136
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:58,800
They will find me.

137
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:00,800
Yes.

138
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:02,800
So you should take good care of them.

139
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:18,800
This little girl.

140
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:20,800
You are very personality.

141
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:22,800
What is she?

142
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:24,800
She should be a fat girl.

143
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:26,800
Fat.

144
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:28,800
Fat.

145
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:30,800
The book says,

146
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:32,800
this demon is a water-based monster.

147
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:34,800
It is a dead plant.

148
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:36,800
It is a world-wide monster.

149
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:38,800
So you are the hero of the Sino-San Water-Body.

150
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:44,800
But it seems

151
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:46,800
there is no evil.

152
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:52,800
Pei Jiejie knows how to observe demons.

153
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:54,800
She will talk to them.

154
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:04,800
Hello.

155
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:06,800
Have you seen our friend?

156
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:16,800
Maybe you are not good enough to describe her.

157
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:18,800
So she doesn't recognize her.

158
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:20,800
I will try.

159
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:22,800
Have you seen our friend?

160
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:24,800
She wears blue clothes.

161
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:26,800
Not me.

162
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:32,800
Not me.

163
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:42,800
Hello.

164
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:44,800
Have you seen our friend?

165
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:46,800
He is taller than this demon.

166
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:48,800
He is bigger than this demon.

167
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:52,800
What are you looking at?

168
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:54,800
Look at me.

169
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:00,800
Where is he?

170
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:06,800
Why do you want to talk about Zhao Yanzhou?

171
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:10,800
Because I want freedom.

172
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:14,800
What does it have to do with

173
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:16,800
the freedom of Zhao Yanzhou?

174
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:18,800
What does it have to do with?

175
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:20,800
You and Zhao Yanzhou have blood and blood.

176
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:24,800
You are with a person who is born to be against you.

177
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:28,800
What are you going to do?

178
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:30,800
Do you hate him?

179
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:36,800
I...

180
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:40,800
He killed your father's brother.

181
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:42,800
He killed so many innocent people.

182
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:44,800
But you can't kill him.

183
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:46,800
You can't kill him.

184
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:48,800
You have to fight him.

185
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:52,800
How can you not hate him?

186
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:16,800
You hate him?

187
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:18,800
What do you want?

188
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:26,800
The Lingxi Manor is a Western foot.

189
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:28,800
Lingxi Manor is a Western foot.

190
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:34,800
It can make the Western foot feel better.

191
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:36,800
It can make the Western foot feel better.

192
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:38,800
I hope I can attract the energy from the Manor.

193
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:46,800
Then I think of Zallow Deity.

194
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:52,800
Master composer, do you know what Qi is?

195
00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:58,800
The power of theен in the heaven and earth men.

196
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:01,800
They are the genius andnaden of themixture of this enemy.

197
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:04,800
To everyone who smells andoh with it.

198
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:10,800
Come on.

199
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:12,800
Let the people you hate

200
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:14,800
What should I do?

201
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:32,800
Kill him.

202
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:44,800
Kill him.

203
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:02,800
Mi Daohun,

204
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:06,800
let's use the White God Power to explore the Water of the Blood.

205
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:15,800
You are a demon.

206
00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:20,800
You need to use my power to feel the barrier.

207
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:24,800
I can do it myself.

208
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:28,800
You want to hear the lady say it?

209
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:33,800
How old are you?

210
00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:34,800
You know these things.

211
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:36,800
I remember that I was three hundred years old.

212
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:39,800
I was the first to know the power of the South.

213
00:14:39,800 --> 00:14:41,800
I am a demon.

214
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:43,800
I am a demon.

215
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:45,800
I am a demon.

216
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:51,800
Let's go.

217
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:53,800
Let's go.

218
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:02,800
What's going on?

219
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:12,800
What's wrong?

220
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:18,800
The road is blocked.

221
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:32,800
Kill him.

222
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:42,800
You scared me.

223
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:43,800
My friend,

224
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:45,800
how did you get out of the demon?

225
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:08,800
What's going on?

226
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:13,800
The world is in danger.

227
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:15,800
The Goddess of Light and Power

228
00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:17,800
are in danger.

229
00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:19,800
They are in danger.

230
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:21,800
They are in danger.

231
00:16:21,800 --> 00:16:23,800
They are safe.

232
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:27,800
Those who use the White God Power

233
00:16:27,800 --> 00:16:29,800
should use the Red Bead to guard the God's Love.

234
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:36,800
The Goddess of Light and Power?

235
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:38,800
The Goddess of Light and Power?

236
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:40,800
What demon would want to be the Goddess of Light and Power?

237
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:42,800
Do you think the Goddess is so good at it?

238
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:46,800
I read on the book

239
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:48,800
that the Green Bead is a hundred-year-old tree.

240
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:51,800
It is really a power of the power of the White God Power.

241
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:56,800
The Green Bead is just a power for yourself.

242
00:16:57,800 --> 00:17:00,800
In fact, it is just a normal medicine.

243
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:02,800
I have seen it in the red building.

244
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:05,800
It flies in the forest all the time.

245
00:17:05,800 --> 00:17:07,800
It flies.

246
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:09,800
It has to be fried by the fire.

247
00:17:09,800 --> 00:17:11,800
How can a small horse go

248
00:17:11,800 --> 00:17:13,800
and be called a Goddess?

249
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:21,800
Most of the people

250
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:24,800
just want to satisfy their desire to be born.

251
00:17:25,800 --> 00:17:27,800
The heart has a request

252
00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:30,800
to be the King of the Goddess.

253
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:33,800
However, they will be exposed

254
00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:35,800
to the evil of the God.

255
00:17:35,800 --> 00:17:37,800
The God is not good.

256
00:17:37,800 --> 00:17:39,800
The God is not human.

257
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:41,800
He is suffering.

258
00:17:43,800 --> 00:17:45,800
The heart has a request to be the King of the Goddess.

259
00:17:45,800 --> 00:17:47,800
He has to give the responsibility

260
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:49,800
to the Goddess of Light and Power.

261
00:17:55,800 --> 00:17:58,800
If the people of the tree die,

262
00:17:59,800 --> 00:18:02,800
the tree is not the only one.

263
00:18:03,800 --> 00:18:04,800
Is it?

264
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:06,800
But there is only a normal mural.

265
00:18:07,800 --> 00:18:09,800
There is no exit.

266
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:11,800
Fei.

267
00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:20,800
The Chief of the Mountain is here.

268
00:18:23,800 --> 00:18:26,800
Since Qing Gang wants to be a Goddess,

269
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:28,800
and wants to be a human,

270
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:30,800
she is the Goddess.

271
00:18:31,800 --> 00:18:33,800
Then we will sit here.

272
00:18:43,800 --> 00:18:45,800
Master, you...

273
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:02,800
Let's go.

274
00:19:03,800 --> 00:19:04,800
I...

275
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:06,800
I don't know what's inside.

276
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:08,800
Zhao Yanzhou, you go first.

277
00:19:08,800 --> 00:19:09,800
I will wait for you.

278
00:19:12,800 --> 00:19:13,800
Let's go.

279
00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:27,800
Sister Wenjing.

280
00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:28,800
Where is she?

281
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:29,800
Da Yao.

282
00:19:29,800 --> 00:19:30,800
Da Yao.

283
00:19:30,800 --> 00:19:31,800
Open the door.

284
00:19:31,800 --> 00:19:33,800
So you found the way out?

285
00:19:34,800 --> 00:19:35,800
Or the trap?

286
00:19:37,800 --> 00:19:39,800
No matter what,

287
00:19:39,800 --> 00:19:40,800
we can only go forward.

288
00:19:41,800 --> 00:19:42,800
Come on.

289
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:44,800
Protect me.

290
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:45,800
Otherwise, we will die together.

291
00:19:46,800 --> 00:19:47,800
Of course.

292
00:19:50,800 --> 00:19:51,800
Open the door.

293
00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:54,800
Why can't I open it?

294
00:19:54,800 --> 00:19:56,800
Fei, you go first.

295
00:19:57,800 --> 00:19:58,800
The door is not open.

296
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:00,800
The door is not open.

297
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:01,800
It's broken.

298
00:20:05,800 --> 00:20:06,800
Sister Fei.

299
00:20:06,800 --> 00:20:08,800
What's wrong, Sister Fei?

300
00:20:11,800 --> 00:20:12,800
Oh, my God.

301
00:20:12,800 --> 00:20:14,800
Sister Fei, you got a plague.

302
00:20:14,800 --> 00:20:15,800
A plague?

303
00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:27,800
Xiao Zhuang.

304
00:20:56,800 --> 00:20:58,000
Was it the futuristic that will warships

305
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,800
that attacked Black Star,

306
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:01,800
who will take theafter?

307
00:21:17,800 --> 00:21:18,800
Yanzhou,

308
00:21:19,800 --> 00:21:20,800
Xiao Zhuang.

309
00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:28,800
The first one is the most powerful one.

310
00:21:28,800 --> 00:21:30,800
The second one is the most powerful one.

311
00:21:30,800 --> 00:21:32,800
The third one is the most powerful one.

312
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:34,800
The fourth one is the most powerful one.

313
00:21:34,800 --> 00:21:36,800
The fourth one is the most powerful one.

314
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:38,800
The fourth one is the most powerful one.

315
00:21:38,800 --> 00:21:40,800
The fourth one is the most powerful one.

316
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:42,800
The fourth one is the most powerful one.

317
00:21:42,800 --> 00:21:44,800
The fourth one is the most powerful one.

318
00:21:44,800 --> 00:21:46,800
The fourth one is the most powerful one.

319
00:21:46,800 --> 00:21:48,800
The fourth one is the most powerful one.

320
00:21:48,800 --> 00:21:50,800
The fourth one is the most powerful one.

321
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:52,800
The fourth one is the most powerful one.

322
00:21:52,800 --> 00:21:54,800
The fourth one is the most powerful one.

323
00:21:54,800 --> 00:21:56,800
The third one is the most powerful one.

324
00:21:56,800 --> 00:21:58,800
The fifth one is the most powerful one.

325
00:21:58,800 --> 00:22:05,800
MAC

326
00:22:06,800 --> 00:22:08,800
Xiao Chuan, do not come over me.

327
00:22:08,800 --> 00:22:10,800
Say the power is Phew!

328
00:22:10,800 --> 00:22:12,800
It is already dangerous.

329
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:16,800
You are not that powerful.

330
00:22:16,800 --> 00:22:18,800
I will kill you.

331
00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:20,800
First, let's use the laundering system to heal.

332
00:22:20,800 --> 00:22:22,800
We will start the magic and end the magic.

333
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:24,800
I can't do it anymore.

334
00:22:27,800 --> 00:22:30,800
Don't move. I'll help you.

335
00:22:31,800 --> 00:22:35,800
I'll kill you. I promised you long ago, didn't I?

336
00:22:35,800 --> 00:22:37,800
But not now.

337
00:22:52,800 --> 00:22:55,800
I'll kill you.

338
00:23:22,800 --> 00:23:24,800
You're the evil bird.

339
00:23:52,800 --> 00:23:54,800
You've grown up, Master.

340
00:23:55,800 --> 00:23:59,800
You're as annoying as you were in the boat today.

341
00:24:08,800 --> 00:24:12,800
To hold his strength, you should be less powerful.

342
00:24:15,800 --> 00:24:17,800
I'm much more powerful.

343
00:24:18,800 --> 00:24:20,800
I know you have a lot.

344
00:24:20,800 --> 00:24:24,800
But I can't recover in a while, can I?

345
00:24:26,800 --> 00:24:29,800
I didn't expect that the famous evil bird

346
00:24:29,800 --> 00:24:32,800
would hurt people and save them.

347
00:24:33,800 --> 00:24:37,800
Master, I don't know how you feel about it.

348
00:24:40,800 --> 00:24:41,800
I want to save him.

349
00:24:42,800 --> 00:24:45,800
It's not someone else. It's my friend.

350
00:24:46,800 --> 00:24:48,800
You treat him as your friend.

351
00:24:49,800 --> 00:24:51,800
But what does he treat you as?

352
00:24:52,800 --> 00:24:55,800
Who is the one standing in front of you, Dr. Zhu?

353
00:24:56,800 --> 00:24:58,800
The enemy of the sky.

354
00:25:01,800 --> 00:25:05,800
What should you do in front of you?

355
00:25:07,800 --> 00:25:09,800
I'm going to kill him.

356
00:25:10,800 --> 00:25:12,800
Xiaochun.

357
00:25:13,800 --> 00:25:15,800
Xiaochun.

358
00:25:20,800 --> 00:25:22,800
What do you want?

359
00:25:23,800 --> 00:25:25,800
I want your inner bullet.

360
00:25:27,800 --> 00:25:29,800
You have it.

361
00:25:29,800 --> 00:25:31,800
Why do you want to steal it from me?

362
00:25:32,800 --> 00:25:35,800
There's only your inner bullet in the world.

363
00:25:35,800 --> 00:25:41,800
Only the bullet in the world can destroy the seal of the White-Colored.

364
00:25:46,800 --> 00:25:49,800
I want to remove the seal of the White-Colored on me.

365
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:53,800
I want to use it for free.

366
00:25:56,800 --> 00:25:57,800
The seal?

367
00:25:59,800 --> 00:26:01,800
Because of this seal,

368
00:26:01,800 --> 00:26:05,800
I can't get out of the Linxi Mountain because of my life.

369
00:26:06,800 --> 00:26:09,800
The White-Colored is worth a lot.

370
00:26:17,800 --> 00:26:19,800
Dr. Zhu, what are you waiting for?

371
00:26:19,800 --> 00:26:21,800
Why don't you kill him?

372
00:26:31,800 --> 00:26:33,800
Xiaochun.

373
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:35,800
Xiaochun.

374
00:26:44,800 --> 00:26:46,800
Xiaochun.

375
00:27:01,800 --> 00:27:03,800
Xiaochun.

376
00:27:03,800 --> 00:27:05,800
Xiaochun.

377
00:27:05,800 --> 00:27:07,800
Xiaochun.

378
00:27:07,800 --> 00:27:09,800
Xiaochun.

379
00:27:09,800 --> 00:27:11,800
Xiaochun.

380
00:27:11,800 --> 00:27:13,800
Xiaochun.

381
00:27:13,800 --> 00:27:15,800
Xiaochun.

382
00:27:15,800 --> 00:27:17,800
Xiaochun.

383
00:27:17,800 --> 00:27:19,800
Xiaochun.

384
00:27:19,800 --> 00:27:21,800
Xiaochun.

385
00:27:21,800 --> 00:27:23,800
Xiaochun.

386
00:27:23,800 --> 00:27:25,800
Xiaochun.

387
00:27:25,800 --> 00:27:27,800
Xiaochun.

388
00:27:27,800 --> 00:27:29,800
Xiaochun.

389
00:27:30,800 --> 00:27:32,800
Xiaochun.

390
00:27:38,800 --> 00:27:41,800
The strength and the demon aura here are really strong.

391
00:27:41,800 --> 00:27:43,800
They have lost my sight.

392
00:27:43,800 --> 00:27:47,800
They didn't notice that there was a seal of the White-Colored.

393
00:27:49,800 --> 00:27:52,800
You two combined to act and fooled me?

394
00:27:52,800 --> 00:27:55,800
No. I didn't act.

395
00:27:55,800 --> 00:27:57,800
I'm really afraid.

396
00:27:57,800 --> 00:28:00,800
Your power is really scary.

397
00:28:00,800 --> 00:28:02,800
I'm more scary.

398
00:28:02,800 --> 00:28:04,800
Do you want to try?

399
00:28:05,800 --> 00:28:08,800
When will you realize it?

400
00:28:12,800 --> 00:28:15,800
Don't move. I'm helping you.

401
00:28:15,800 --> 00:28:17,800
I'm going to kill you.

402
00:28:17,800 --> 00:28:20,800
I promised you long ago, didn't I?

403
00:28:20,800 --> 00:28:22,800
But not now.

404
00:28:27,800 --> 00:28:29,800
Xiaochun.

405
00:28:29,800 --> 00:28:31,800
Xiaochun.

406
00:28:31,800 --> 00:28:33,800
Xiaochun.

407
00:28:33,800 --> 00:28:35,800
Xiaochun.

408
00:28:35,800 --> 00:28:37,800
Xiaochun.

409
00:28:37,800 --> 00:28:39,800
Xiaochun.

410
00:28:39,800 --> 00:28:41,800
Xiaochun.

411
00:28:41,800 --> 00:28:43,800
Xiaochun.

412
00:28:43,800 --> 00:28:45,800
Xiaochun.

413
00:28:45,800 --> 00:28:47,800
Xiaochun.

414
00:28:47,800 --> 00:28:49,800
You've recovered from your normal life.

415
00:28:49,800 --> 00:28:51,800
You're still in a bad mood.

416
00:28:51,800 --> 00:28:53,800
You don't want to know the real Lu Ting?

417
00:28:53,800 --> 00:28:55,800
It's your normal life.

418
00:28:55,800 --> 00:28:57,800
Now?

419
00:28:57,800 --> 00:28:59,800
No.

420
00:28:59,800 --> 00:29:01,800
I'm talking about Yanxi.

421
00:29:01,800 --> 00:29:03,800
Yanxi?

422
00:29:03,800 --> 00:29:07,800
Are you sure you didn't get to attack the temple?

423
00:29:07,800 --> 00:29:09,800
No.

424
00:29:09,800 --> 00:29:11,800
Lord Xiaozhuo.

425
00:29:11,800 --> 00:29:13,800
Are you ready?

426
00:29:13,800 --> 00:29:15,800
Yes.

427
00:29:17,800 --> 00:29:19,800
It's a pity.

428
00:29:19,800 --> 00:29:23,800
The seal of the White-Colored is really reliable.

429
00:29:23,800 --> 00:29:26,800
But I need to use the power of the heavens and earth

430
00:29:26,800 --> 00:29:29,800
to punish myself.

431
00:29:29,800 --> 00:29:33,800
Even if I die, I don't need the seal of the White-Colored.

432
00:29:33,800 --> 00:29:36,800
The one who lied to you about my seal

433
00:29:36,800 --> 00:29:39,800
is not a fool.

434
00:29:41,800 --> 00:29:45,800
You're the liar who's lying.

435
00:29:45,800 --> 00:29:47,800
In this world,

436
00:29:47,800 --> 00:29:49,800
no one believes in the truth.

437
00:29:49,800 --> 00:29:52,800
Xu Qing is the one.

438
00:29:54,800 --> 00:29:56,800
Forget it.

439
00:29:56,800 --> 00:29:59,800
I just want to know who's the one who lied to you

440
00:29:59,800 --> 00:30:02,800
and made you marry my wife.

441
00:30:07,800 --> 00:30:10,800
I can tell by your words.

442
00:30:10,800 --> 00:30:12,800
You have a familiar temperament

443
00:30:12,800 --> 00:30:15,800
that I hate.

444
00:30:18,800 --> 00:30:20,800
Wait a minute.

445
00:30:23,800 --> 00:30:25,800
I'm sorry.

446
00:30:25,800 --> 00:30:27,800
I'm sorry.

447
00:30:27,800 --> 00:30:29,800
I'm sorry.

448
00:30:29,800 --> 00:30:31,800
I'm sorry.

449
00:30:31,800 --> 00:30:33,800
I'm sorry.

450
00:30:33,800 --> 00:30:35,800
I'm sorry.

451
00:30:35,800 --> 00:30:37,800
I'm sorry.

452
00:30:37,800 --> 00:30:39,800
I'm sorry.

453
00:30:39,800 --> 00:30:41,800
I'm sorry.

454
00:30:41,800 --> 00:30:43,800
I'm sorry.

455
00:30:43,800 --> 00:30:45,800
I'm sorry.

456
00:30:45,800 --> 00:30:47,800
I'm sorry.

457
00:30:47,800 --> 00:30:49,800
I'm sorry.

458
00:30:49,800 --> 00:30:51,800
I'm sorry.

459
00:30:52,800 --> 00:30:54,800
It hurts.

460
00:31:01,800 --> 00:31:04,800
Your hand really hurts.

461
00:31:04,800 --> 00:31:07,800
I mean your hand.

462
00:31:12,800 --> 00:31:14,800
Wen Yi.

463
00:31:22,800 --> 00:31:24,800
Xiao Zhuang.

464
00:31:29,800 --> 00:31:31,800
Xiao Zhuang.

465
00:31:41,800 --> 00:31:44,800
Xiao Zhuang, please stay away from me.

466
00:31:44,800 --> 00:31:46,800
Yes.

467
00:31:46,800 --> 00:31:49,800
Please stay away from me.

468
00:31:49,800 --> 00:31:51,800
I'm a demon.

469
00:31:51,800 --> 00:31:53,800
I have a lot of blood.

470
00:31:53,800 --> 00:31:55,800
I'm fine.

471
00:31:55,800 --> 00:31:57,800
But I have nothing to do.

472
00:31:57,800 --> 00:31:59,800
Then you're weird.

473
00:32:03,800 --> 00:32:05,800
No.

474
00:32:05,800 --> 00:32:07,800
He's so good.

475
00:32:07,800 --> 00:32:09,800
We have to leave here.

476
00:32:09,800 --> 00:32:11,800
Otherwise, we'll be in trouble.

477
00:32:11,800 --> 00:32:13,800
Okay.

478
00:32:13,800 --> 00:32:15,800
I'll dig a hole and dig it out.

479
00:32:19,800 --> 00:32:21,800
Let's go.

480
00:32:24,800 --> 00:32:26,800
Qing Yang?

481
00:32:32,800 --> 00:32:34,800
What's going on?

482
00:32:34,800 --> 00:32:36,800
Is he holding Qing Yang?

483
00:32:36,800 --> 00:32:38,800
Are you sure?

484
00:32:38,800 --> 00:32:40,800
I'm sure.

485
00:32:40,800 --> 00:32:42,800
I'll stay here and take care of Sister Pei.

486
00:32:42,800 --> 00:32:44,800
Guan Jing.

487
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:46,800
I...

488
00:32:50,800 --> 00:32:52,800
I...

489
00:33:00,800 --> 00:33:02,800
Don't come near me.

490
00:33:04,800 --> 00:33:06,800
I don't need your help.

491
00:33:06,800 --> 00:33:08,800
I don't need your help.

492
00:33:20,800 --> 00:33:22,800
Tian Chaos packet of pig liver

493
00:33:29,800 --> 00:33:32,800
Tian, you Derek!

494
00:33:34,800 --> 00:33:37,800
Teach me. I'm a physician.

495
00:33:41,800 --> 00:33:44,800
What are you going to do, Xiao Zhuang?

496
00:33:45,800 --> 00:33:47,800
Master said that

497
00:33:47,800 --> 00:33:53,400
My master always says that a human heart cannot be saved by death.

498
00:34:04,400 --> 00:34:06,600
A human heart?

499
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:13,600
If I tell you, I am the most powerful and most powerful of all three worlds,

500
00:34:14,600 --> 00:34:16,600
will you still save me?

501
00:34:18,600 --> 00:34:20,600
I actually already guessed it.

502
00:34:21,600 --> 00:34:25,600
You must have passed the Wuyi through those red beads, right?

503
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:31,600
That red beads...

504
00:34:32,400 --> 00:34:34,400
burned through the blood of the fat.

505
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:39,000
Why did you do that?

506
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:45,000
You know that I was once a godess who was worshiped by everyone?

507
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:50,000
I have been living in this world for hundreds of years.

508
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:53,000
What is the meaning of this?

509
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:58,000
To bully me, to bless them, to get rid of the disease.

510
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:01,000
Their sincerity and faith,

511
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:03,000
they are all the same,

512
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:05,000
and they are all the same.

513
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:09,000
So I am also responsible for forcing them to do so.

514
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:13,000
It seems that I have taken advantage of others' gifts.

515
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:15,000
I am sorry.

516
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:18,000
I have been thinking of getting something back.

517
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:23,000
But one day,

518
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:25,000
I came here.

519
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:29,000
His birth was a warm-hearted struggle.

520
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:32,000
I was so happy.

521
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:35,000
I still can't stop the evil coming.

522
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:38,000
Please save us.

523
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:05,000
Sorry, I am not necessary here.

524
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:08,000
I don't even know what I have deserved.

525
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:28,720
Although we don't have the money

526
00:36:28,720 --> 00:36:31,720
They destroyed Lin Xi's villa.

527
00:36:32,720 --> 00:36:34,720
They destroyed my statue.

528
00:36:34,720 --> 00:36:36,720
They destroyed my dirty water.

529
00:36:36,720 --> 00:36:37,720
They destroyed my ashes.

530
00:36:37,720 --> 00:36:39,720
No one is willing to believe me anymore.

531
00:36:40,720 --> 00:36:41,720
They destroyed my phoenix.

532
00:36:58,720 --> 00:37:00,720
Jin Mi

533
00:37:22,720 --> 00:37:26,320
Getting rid of醒ch Bourna

534
00:37:28,720 --> 00:37:32,860
Taking her as a wallpaper.

535
00:37:38,120 --> 00:37:43,980
I unsealed the compensation in order to zawsze

536
00:37:43,980 --> 00:37:47,860
fulfill my goddaughter-��게요

537
00:37:47,860 --> 00:37:50,860
to protect her from finders.

538
00:37:50,860 --> 00:37:55,100
Why did nonele of you

539
00:37:55,100 --> 00:37:58,100
give me the opportunity?

540
00:37:58,100 --> 00:38:00,100
I've been locked in here for hundreds of years.

541
00:38:02,700 --> 00:38:05,700
I can't see the end of the world.

542
00:38:09,500 --> 00:38:12,500
Are you a mortal or a young man?

543
00:38:14,100 --> 00:38:15,100
I'm so lucky.

544
00:38:16,500 --> 00:38:19,100
You can't understand this kind of life and death.

545
00:38:19,700 --> 00:38:21,500
It's a sign of ignorance.

546
00:38:24,900 --> 00:38:26,100
Someone told me

547
00:38:27,100 --> 00:38:29,700
that as long as I want to get out of here,

548
00:38:30,500 --> 00:38:35,500
and kill Zhao Yanzhou and get his burden,

549
00:38:36,500 --> 00:38:40,500
I can untie the white seal and leave here.

550
00:38:51,300 --> 00:38:52,300
Little Chuge.

551
00:38:57,100 --> 00:38:59,100
I know this person you're talking about.

552
00:38:59,700 --> 00:39:00,700
His name is Li Lun.

553
00:39:02,100 --> 00:39:03,100
Right?

554
00:39:09,500 --> 00:39:10,500
Brother Qing.

555
00:39:11,500 --> 00:39:14,700
You're the only one who's going to kill the world.

556
00:39:15,100 --> 00:39:16,500
Are you guilty?

557
00:39:19,500 --> 00:39:20,500
It's not his fault.

558
00:39:20,900 --> 00:39:21,900
It's my fault.

559
00:39:22,300 --> 00:39:23,100
Because I

560
00:39:23,900 --> 00:39:25,700
killed his life.

561
00:39:26,900 --> 00:39:27,900
You're talking.

562
00:39:32,300 --> 00:39:33,300
If I were him,

563
00:39:34,900 --> 00:39:36,700
I'd be hurt too.

564
00:39:52,700 --> 00:39:53,900
I can solve the plague.

565
00:39:54,700 --> 00:39:56,500
As long as you can save him,

566
00:39:57,700 --> 00:39:59,300
I'll save everyone for you.

567
00:40:00,300 --> 00:40:01,500
For real.

568
00:40:07,300 --> 00:40:11,100
But I'm afraid that the gods will be sad when the world is at a loss.

569
00:40:13,900 --> 00:40:15,500
If I were somewhere else,

570
00:40:15,900 --> 00:40:17,100
I'm afraid I won't be able to save him.

571
00:40:17,500 --> 00:40:18,500
But here,

572
00:40:19,300 --> 00:40:20,700
maybe I can try.

573
00:40:21,700 --> 00:40:22,700
You have a way.

574
00:40:24,100 --> 00:40:25,100
Because of the plague,

575
00:40:25,900 --> 00:40:28,300
the whole Sinai Water Formation is covered by the power.

576
00:40:28,700 --> 00:40:30,300
The more power, the more powerful it is.

577
00:40:31,500 --> 00:40:32,900
My waist strength is getting bigger.

578
00:40:34,300 --> 00:40:37,900
I can try to use this power to heal him.

579
00:40:53,900 --> 00:40:55,900
I'm afraid I won't be able to save him.

580
00:40:56,900 --> 00:40:58,900
I'm afraid I won't be able to save him.

581
00:40:59,900 --> 00:41:01,900
I'm afraid I won't be able to save him.

582
00:41:02,900 --> 00:41:04,900
I'm afraid I won't be able to save him.

583
00:41:05,900 --> 00:41:07,900
I'm afraid I won't be able to save him.

584
00:41:08,900 --> 00:41:10,900
I'm afraid I won't be able to save him.

585
00:41:11,900 --> 00:41:13,900
I'm afraid I won't be able to save him.

586
00:41:14,900 --> 00:41:16,900
I'm afraid I won't be able to save him.

587
00:41:24,900 --> 00:41:25,900
Thank you.

588
00:41:28,900 --> 00:41:29,900
Save him.

589
00:41:34,900 --> 00:41:35,900
He's very important to you.

590
00:41:41,900 --> 00:41:42,900
It's important.

591
00:41:44,900 --> 00:41:45,900
It's very important.

592
00:41:47,900 --> 00:41:49,900
I was born in the Ming Yun tribe.

593
00:41:49,900 --> 00:41:52,900
I came here from the point of view of the plague.

594
00:41:53,900 --> 00:41:55,900
Whether it's human or demon,

595
00:41:57,900 --> 00:41:59,900
I think I'm in my fate.

596
00:42:00,900 --> 00:42:03,900
I'm afraid I won't be able to save him.

597
00:42:24,900 --> 00:42:26,900
I'm afraid I won't be able to save him.

598
00:42:30,900 --> 00:42:31,900
But he doesn't understand.

599
00:42:33,900 --> 00:42:35,900
He can be a puppet.

600
00:42:36,900 --> 00:42:37,900
He can be free and free.

601
00:42:39,900 --> 00:42:41,900
He can fly to the Qinggeng Bird in the sky.

602
00:42:54,900 --> 00:42:56,900
I want to go to the world.

603
00:42:57,900 --> 00:43:00,900
I don't want to be sealed in the dark of the Great King.

604
00:43:06,900 --> 00:43:10,900
So I escaped the Great King at that time.

605
00:43:24,900 --> 00:43:26,900
The world is full of flowers and hot plants.

606
00:43:27,900 --> 00:43:29,900
The plants and plants are all so magical.

607
00:43:32,900 --> 00:43:33,900
Only in the world

608
00:43:35,900 --> 00:43:37,900
can I feel alive.

609
00:43:53,900 --> 00:43:56,900
I'm afraid I won't be able to save him.

610
00:44:23,900 --> 00:44:25,900
I'm afraid I won't be able to save him.

611
00:44:53,900 --> 00:44:55,900
I'm afraid I won't be able to save him.

612
00:45:23,900 --> 00:45:25,900
I'm afraid I won't be able to save him.
