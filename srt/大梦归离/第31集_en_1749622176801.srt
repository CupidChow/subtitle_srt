1
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,020
With that, I have no choice but to find you.

2
00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:37,640
I think we should have stayed a couple of months.

3
00:01:38,300 --> 00:01:40,560
After we believe in you,

4
00:01:40,580 --> 00:01:43,120
I will never able to let you go.

5
00:01:47,300 --> 00:01:49,040
What?

6
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:53,040
I just don't want to die.

7
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:56,040
It's my fault.

8
00:01:58,040 --> 00:02:01,040
You saved me to give me the Dragon Spirit.

9
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:06,040
Silly.

10
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:10,040
I'm happy to be able to save you.

11
00:02:11,040 --> 00:02:12,040
I'm dead.

12
00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:15,040
There will be a second White God in the world.

13
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:20,040
But there is only one small wine in the world.

14
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:24,040
But...

15
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:31,040
There is only one smile in the world.

16
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:46,040
I'm sorry.

17
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:28,040
Lord Shen Lv and Lord Zhao.

18
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:30,040
Something happened in the capital.

19
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:38,040
Why did you suddenly get a crisis?

20
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:41,040
Did you come here to see me?

21
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:44,040
The doctors in Tiandu City are all dead.

22
00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:48,040
Is it because of the demon?

23
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:52,040
Then I will definitely call my father to the test.

24
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:54,040
This is what I want to say.

25
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:58,040
Lord Fan, are you missing?

26
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:05,040
Father, it's me.

27
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:07,040
Little wine, don't come in.

28
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:10,040
Father will be infected by the plague.

29
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:14,040
The whole people in Tiandu City should be infected.

30
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:18,040
This plague is a normal child.

31
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:20,040
I didn't expect it to be so fast.

32
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:32,040
I suspect this banana

33
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:35,040
might be the original cause of the plague.

34
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:39,040
It's blood.

35
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:42,040
Blood?

36
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:44,040
What blood?

37
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:48,040
A very familiar drug.

38
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:53,040
Blood.

39
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:56,040
Blood?

40
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:58,040
Isn't he dead?

41
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:01,040
Yes, it's him.

42
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:04,040
Sister Pei,

43
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:05,040
Little Zhuge,

44
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:07,040
please push me back a little bit.

45
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:08,040
Push you back.

46
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:12,040
Very good.

47
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:15,040
Now the people in the city are all Chinese.

48
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:19,040
We can't escape from the city.

49
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:21,040
What happened earlier?

50
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:23,040
Little wine,

51
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:25,040
do you have any way?

52
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:29,040
I have to teach him this.

53
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:34,040
Little wine,

54
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:35,040
do you have any way?

55
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:37,040
Little wine,

56
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:38,040
do you have any way?

57
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:39,040
Little wine,

58
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:40,040
do you have any way?

59
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:41,040
Little wine,

60
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:42,040
do you have any way?

61
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:43,040
Little wine,

62
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:44,040
do you have any way?

63
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:45,040
Little wine,

64
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:46,040
do you have any way?

65
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:47,040
Little wine,

66
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:48,040
do you have any way?

67
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:49,040
Little wine,

68
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:50,040
do you have any way?

69
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:51,040
Little wine,

70
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:52,040
do you have any way?

71
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:53,040
Little wine,

72
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:54,040
do you have any way?

73
00:05:54,040 --> 00:05:55,040
Little wine,

74
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:56,040
do you have any way?

75
00:05:56,040 --> 00:05:57,040
Little wine,

76
00:05:57,040 --> 00:05:58,040
do you have any way?

77
00:05:58,040 --> 00:05:59,040
Little wine,

78
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:00,040
do you have any way?

79
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:01,040
Little wine,

80
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:02,040
do you have any way?

81
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:14,040
Are you okay?

82
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:17,040
I'm still in pain.

83
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:20,040
But

84
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:21,040
the heaven

85
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:24,040
hasn't found any signs of any monster.

86
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:28,040
Even the monster of the dead is gone.

87
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:31,040
That's even more strange.

88
00:06:58,040 --> 00:06:59,040
Little Master.

89
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:09,040
Little Master.

90
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:20,040
They said

91
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:22,040
you stayed here for a day.

92
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:24,040
You didn't eat.

93
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:26,040
No.

94
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:29,040
I didn't have much time.

95
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:33,040
In my father's brother's life,

96
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:35,040
I was gone for a long time.

97
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:37,040
I was the same.

98
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:39,040
I was anxious.

99
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:41,040
I was worried.

100
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:44,040
I felt that time was not enough.

101
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:47,040
Little Master.

102
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:50,040
Actually,

103
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:53,040
I was a little scared.

104
00:07:57,040 --> 00:07:59,040
Then you hold this.

105
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:02,040
Tell me.

106
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:03,040
Why are you scared?

107
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:07,040
I used to think

108
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:08,040
it was my father

109
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:10,040
who killed my mother.

110
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:13,040
So I left in the woods.

111
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:17,040
My father's memory is very little.

112
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:20,040
Every time I think of him,

113
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:23,040
I will be taken by the clouds and the leaves.

114
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:29,040
The love of the snow lotus

115
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:31,040
is deep in the valley.

116
00:08:33,040 --> 00:08:34,040
The age and distance

117
00:08:35,040 --> 00:08:37,040
can never be compared to my existence.

118
00:08:39,040 --> 00:08:40,040
Do you remember

119
00:08:40,040 --> 00:08:43,040
the taste of the medicine I told you?

120
00:08:44,040 --> 00:08:45,040
Of course I remember.

121
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:48,040
I was very happy then.

122
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:51,040
Because I have been with the medicine since I was a child.

123
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:52,040
Actually,

124
00:08:52,040 --> 00:08:53,040
it's because

125
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:54,040
I was very little

126
00:08:54,040 --> 00:08:56,040
when I was very little.

127
00:08:57,040 --> 00:08:58,040
My mother was sick.

128
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:01,040
Her memory

129
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:03,040
was also confused.

130
00:09:04,040 --> 00:09:06,040
But I remember the taste of the medicine on her body.

131
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:11,040
Then every time I smell the medicine,

132
00:09:12,040 --> 00:09:13,040
I will feel that

133
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:16,040
my mother is still holding me.

134
00:09:16,040 --> 00:09:17,040
I know.

135
00:09:24,040 --> 00:09:25,040
I know.

136
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:27,040
It seems that

137
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:29,040
every time I know the man of the heart,

138
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:31,040
I will think of my mother.

139
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:34,040
Every time I know the delicious food,

140
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:37,040
I will think of Yin Lei.

141
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:40,040
Every time I hear the bell,

142
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:44,040
I will think of the little master.

143
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:48,040
But

144
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:51,040
I haven't cooked with my father

145
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:52,040
and eaten a meal.

146
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:55,040
I will tell you everything.

147
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:00,040
Xiaoxiao,

148
00:10:00,040 --> 00:10:02,040
you have to believe in yourself.

149
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:04,040
You have time

150
00:10:06,040 --> 00:10:07,040
to cure your illness.

151
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:19,040
But I am no longer here.

152
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:24,040
The little master

153
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:28,040
must have always thought of

154
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:29,040
his own brother,

155
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:30,040
my father.

156
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:34,040
My brother

157
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:37,040
is a very good person.

158
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:39,040
I admire them

159
00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:41,040
and want to become them.

160
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:43,040
We also want to become them.

161
00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:47,040
Little Master,

162
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:51,040
I also want to become a person like you.

163
00:10:52,040 --> 00:10:53,040
What kind of person am I?

164
00:10:56,040 --> 00:10:57,040
At least,

165
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:01,040
at least not as manly as I am.

166
00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:04,040
I am caught by others

167
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:06,040
and the leader behind me

168
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:08,040
is the one who is the most important person.

169
00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:11,040
Since I was a child,

170
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:16,040
I have always wanted to become a brother

171
00:11:16,040 --> 00:11:17,040
and protect others.

172
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:20,040
I have never done it.

173
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:24,040
But your appearance

174
00:11:26,040 --> 00:11:27,040
made me do it.

175
00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:31,040
You made me

176
00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:33,040
a brother.

177
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:35,040
I became a brother.

178
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:50,040
Master Chu,

179
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:52,040
how did you get

180
00:11:52,040 --> 00:11:53,040
such a good person

181
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:55,040
in your fortune?

182
00:11:56,040 --> 00:11:57,040
After they passed away,

183
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:01,040
I was able to fix it for a long time.

184
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:04,040
I met

185
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:06,040
a person.

186
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:12,040
He said,

187
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:14,040
I hope I am not helpless,

188
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:18,040
and I don't want to be hurt by you.

189
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:21,040
I hope you don't be hurt by me

190
00:12:22,040 --> 00:12:23,040
and be sad.

191
00:12:28,040 --> 00:12:30,040
He grew up with me.

192
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:32,040
I have always been

193
00:12:32,040 --> 00:12:34,040
a good person.

194
00:12:36,040 --> 00:12:37,040
You mean

195
00:12:38,040 --> 00:12:39,040
my sister, right?

196
00:12:46,040 --> 00:12:48,040
Xiao Zhuo

197
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:51,040
likes my sister.

198
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:52,040
Right?

199
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:56,040
Then why don't you tell him?

200
00:13:00,040 --> 00:13:02,040
There are many types of love.

201
00:13:04,040 --> 00:13:05,040
People like Qiangwei.

202
00:13:06,040 --> 00:13:08,040
When they pass by,

203
00:13:08,040 --> 00:13:09,040
they will praise him.

204
00:13:10,040 --> 00:13:12,040
He is so sweet and beautiful.

205
00:13:14,040 --> 00:13:15,040
They will take it down

206
00:13:16,040 --> 00:13:17,040
and put it on their feet.

207
00:13:18,040 --> 00:13:19,040
On their knees.

208
00:13:20,040 --> 00:13:21,040
When others see it,

209
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:24,040
they will envy it.

210
00:13:28,040 --> 00:13:29,040
Do you think this is love?

211
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:32,040
Yes.

212
00:13:34,040 --> 00:13:36,040
But there is another type of love.

213
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:40,040
It is to give water to him every day.

214
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:42,040
To catch bugs.

215
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:46,040
To watch him eat and work.

216
00:13:48,040 --> 00:13:49,040
To be in the wind,

217
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:50,040
to be in the clouds.

218
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:52,040
To be more beautiful.

219
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:53,040
Xiao Zhuo.

220
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:56,040
Why do I think

221
00:13:57,040 --> 00:13:58,040
the second type

222
00:14:00,040 --> 00:14:01,040
is more

223
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:04,040
than the first one?

224
00:14:06,040 --> 00:14:07,040
Because the second type

225
00:14:08,040 --> 00:14:09,040
is actually...

226
00:14:12,040 --> 00:14:13,040
Really?

227
00:14:16,040 --> 00:14:17,040
Yes.

228
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:20,040
I think

229
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:22,040
I am not very understanding.

230
00:14:30,040 --> 00:14:31,040
But

231
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:35,040
I feel sorry for Xiao Zhuo.

232
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:40,040
To save me,

233
00:14:42,040 --> 00:14:43,040
I cut off all the things

234
00:14:44,040 --> 00:14:45,040
that I have done.

235
00:14:46,040 --> 00:14:47,040
I am sorry.

236
00:14:48,040 --> 00:14:49,040
I am sorry.

237
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:54,040
Did he blame you?

238
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:56,040
Of course not.

239
00:14:57,040 --> 00:14:58,040
He said

240
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:00,040
it was not my fault.

241
00:15:02,040 --> 00:15:03,040
Then you should listen to him.

242
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:06,040
Because

243
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:09,040
I also listened to him when I was young.

244
00:15:18,040 --> 00:15:19,040
Okay.

245
00:15:20,040 --> 00:15:21,040
Do you want to read?

246
00:15:22,040 --> 00:15:23,040
Yes.

247
00:15:24,040 --> 00:15:25,040
Okay.

248
00:15:26,040 --> 00:15:27,040
Then I will be with you.

249
00:15:48,040 --> 00:15:49,040
It's dark.

250
00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:51,040
It's cold.

251
00:15:52,040 --> 00:15:53,040
It's cold.

252
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:56,040
Are you satisfied?

253
00:16:12,040 --> 00:16:13,040
Don't be sad

254
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:16,040
in front of me.

255
00:16:18,040 --> 00:16:19,040
You have gone too far.

256
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:22,100
Xun Shou,

257
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:24,800
you have been

258
00:16:25,880 --> 00:16:28,040
within my dad's house a long time,

259
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:30,040
making me realize

260
00:16:31,180 --> 00:16:32,180
that my only weakness

261
00:16:33,240 --> 00:16:34,320
is your happiness.

262
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:36,980
There is no

263
00:16:38,980 --> 00:16:39,980
happiness in the town.

264
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:41,160
If I could

265
00:16:43,080 --> 00:16:44,080
carry you on my back,

266
00:16:45,080 --> 00:16:45,520
I feelえ

267
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:51,040
I, Yi Fu, am very sensitive.

268
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:55,040
I think he is the one who killed the fruit.

269
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:57,040
Xiao Er.

270
00:16:57,040 --> 00:16:59,040
Father.

271
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:01,040
You always lose your nose.

272
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:03,040
This nose is actually

273
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:05,040
made by me, the one who found the person.

274
00:17:05,040 --> 00:17:07,040
He is gentle and kind.

275
00:17:07,040 --> 00:17:09,040
He is kind-hearted.

276
00:17:09,040 --> 00:17:12,040
He is a very good father.

277
00:17:12,040 --> 00:17:14,040
Until now,

278
00:17:15,040 --> 00:17:17,040
he has been alone for a day.

279
00:17:17,040 --> 00:17:19,040
He doesn't know how to think.

280
00:17:24,040 --> 00:17:26,040
I can't go back.

281
00:17:28,040 --> 00:17:30,040
Don't worry.

282
00:17:30,040 --> 00:17:33,040
Lord Fan is also my future father.

283
00:17:34,040 --> 00:17:38,040
I will wait for him to find Lord Fan.

284
00:17:40,040 --> 00:17:42,040
Then I can...

285
00:17:45,040 --> 00:17:47,040
What can I do?

286
00:17:47,040 --> 00:17:49,040
I will wait for you.

287
00:18:12,040 --> 00:18:14,040
Lord Wei.

288
00:18:17,040 --> 00:18:19,040
Lord Wei.

289
00:18:47,040 --> 00:18:49,040
Lord Wei.

290
00:19:17,040 --> 00:19:19,040
Lord Wei.

291
00:19:47,040 --> 00:20:00,040
Episode 1

292
00:20:10,040 --> 00:20:11,040
I know.

293
00:20:11,040 --> 00:20:12,040
I know how to do it.

294
00:20:12,040 --> 00:20:14,040
I know.

295
00:20:17,040 --> 00:20:19,040
What?

296
00:20:23,040 --> 00:20:24,040
It's亭.

297
00:20:24,040 --> 00:20:25,560
Light sands.

298
00:20:25,560 --> 00:20:28,040
Make fix it when you try.

299
00:20:28,040 --> 00:20:29,040
It's useful.

300
00:20:29,040 --> 00:20:33,040
This is fuf lowers

301
00:20:33,040 --> 00:20:36,040
your balance with Zhao Yin Turtlen as a drink.

302
00:20:36,040 --> 00:20:37,040
Yes

303
00:20:37,040 --> 00:20:39,040
My master naturally mentioned this,

304
00:20:39,040 --> 00:20:42,040
there was a power for people like him,

305
00:20:42,040 --> 00:20:45,040
he can murdered he is a drinker.

306
00:20:45,040 --> 00:20:46,040
It's the first step.

307
00:20:46,040 --> 00:20:47,040
There's still a need to add

308
00:20:47,040 --> 00:20:49,040
the secret of the cure.

309
00:20:49,040 --> 00:20:51,040
It's a form of anti-inflammatory.

310
00:21:07,040 --> 00:21:08,040
Thank you.

311
00:21:11,040 --> 00:21:12,040
Luo.

312
00:21:16,040 --> 00:21:17,040
Well...

313
00:21:29,040 --> 00:21:30,040
The medicine is ready.

314
00:21:30,040 --> 00:21:31,040
Watch my move.

315
00:21:32,040 --> 00:21:33,040
Give me the key.

316
00:21:45,040 --> 00:21:47,040
I know that there's a plague in Tiandu City.

317
00:21:47,040 --> 00:21:49,040
If you don't need it,

318
00:21:49,040 --> 00:21:51,040
you can use the help of the cure.

319
00:21:53,040 --> 00:21:54,040
Thank you, Master Wen.

320
00:21:55,040 --> 00:21:57,040
Remember to clean the house.

321
00:21:57,040 --> 00:21:58,040
Not only do you need to eat,

322
00:21:58,040 --> 00:22:01,040
but also inform the neighbors and friends.

323
00:22:01,040 --> 00:22:03,040
Make them come to get the medicine.

324
00:22:03,040 --> 00:22:04,040
Thank you.

325
00:22:16,040 --> 00:22:17,040
Where are Wen Xiao and them?

326
00:22:18,040 --> 00:22:25,200
They're in the

327
00:22:26,040 --> 00:22:27,040
Chongwu Camp.

328
00:22:27,040 --> 00:22:29,040
It's good that you know

329
00:22:29,040 --> 00:22:31,040
the Chongwu Camp is in a hurry.

330
00:22:31,040 --> 00:22:33,040
Otherwise, we'll be in trouble.

331
00:22:33,040 --> 00:22:35,040
We can't find the other one here.

332
00:22:38,040 --> 00:22:40,040
There's a curse in this secret room.

333
00:22:40,040 --> 00:22:42,040
The cure is ready.

334
00:22:42,040 --> 00:22:44,040
So I decide to bet on it.

335
00:22:46,040 --> 00:22:47,040
Here.

336
00:23:05,040 --> 00:23:06,040
Fei.

337
00:23:08,040 --> 00:23:09,040
Isn't Fei dead?

338
00:23:16,040 --> 00:23:17,040
Fei.

339
00:23:21,040 --> 00:23:22,040
It's really Fei.

340
00:23:28,040 --> 00:23:29,040
Fan.

341
00:23:31,040 --> 00:23:32,040
Shang Zhou.

342
00:23:45,040 --> 00:23:46,040
Father.

343
00:23:47,040 --> 00:23:48,040
Father.

344
00:23:49,040 --> 00:23:50,040
Father.

345
00:23:52,040 --> 00:23:53,040
I'm leaving.

346
00:23:58,040 --> 00:23:59,040
Wait.

347
00:24:01,040 --> 00:24:03,040
Fan is in the body.

348
00:24:04,040 --> 00:24:06,040
I'm going to take her to the hospital.

349
00:24:09,040 --> 00:24:11,040
I'm going to take her to the hospital.

350
00:24:12,040 --> 00:24:14,040
Fan is in the body.

351
00:24:15,040 --> 00:24:16,040
She has a mole.

352
00:24:19,040 --> 00:24:20,040
How can she have a mole?

353
00:24:22,040 --> 00:24:25,040
Because I finally created the real monster.

354
00:24:41,040 --> 00:24:43,040
You're really tired.

355
00:24:47,040 --> 00:24:48,040
You're not good enough.

356
00:24:49,040 --> 00:24:51,040
You have to make yourself look like this.

357
00:24:55,040 --> 00:24:57,040
This is the sacred mountain.

358
00:25:00,040 --> 00:25:01,040
You're not good enough.

359
00:25:02,040 --> 00:25:03,040
You're not good enough.

360
00:25:04,040 --> 00:25:05,040
You're not good enough.

361
00:25:06,040 --> 00:25:07,040
You're not good enough.

362
00:25:08,040 --> 00:25:09,040
You're not good enough.

363
00:25:09,040 --> 00:25:10,040
You're not good enough.

364
00:25:28,040 --> 00:25:29,040
Fan.

365
00:25:34,040 --> 00:25:36,040
You're really smart.

366
00:25:40,040 --> 00:25:42,040
Princess Longyu gave you the pearl.

367
00:25:44,040 --> 00:25:45,040
You gave the pearl

368
00:25:46,040 --> 00:25:48,040
and turned yourself into a monster.

369
00:25:48,040 --> 00:25:50,040
I always have the pearl.

370
00:25:51,040 --> 00:25:53,040
So you're trying to

371
00:25:54,040 --> 00:25:56,040
get the mole in Zhangyuan City.

372
00:25:58,040 --> 00:25:59,040
The mole

373
00:26:01,040 --> 00:26:03,040
has the impurity you want.

374
00:26:10,040 --> 00:26:11,040
Zhangyuan City.

375
00:26:13,040 --> 00:26:14,040
You owe me.

376
00:26:15,040 --> 00:26:17,040
God has given you all the money.

377
00:26:19,040 --> 00:26:21,040
I don't only have the magical power,

378
00:26:22,040 --> 00:26:24,040
but also the power of the impurity.

379
00:26:36,040 --> 00:26:37,040
Master.

380
00:26:38,040 --> 00:26:39,040
Master.

381
00:26:42,040 --> 00:26:43,040
Master, you're still alive.

382
00:26:46,040 --> 00:26:48,040
Our great-grandfather is about to finish.

383
00:26:50,040 --> 00:26:51,040
You'll be too happy

384
00:26:52,040 --> 00:26:53,040
to leave him.

385
00:26:59,040 --> 00:27:01,040
Now that I have this impurity,

386
00:27:02,040 --> 00:27:04,040
I can have it myself.

387
00:27:04,040 --> 00:27:05,040
I'll have it.

388
00:27:06,040 --> 00:27:07,040
Soon,

389
00:27:08,040 --> 00:27:11,040
I'll have a perfect monster.

390
00:27:13,040 --> 00:27:14,040
You're wrong.

391
00:27:15,040 --> 00:27:18,040
I want to win this time.

392
00:27:20,040 --> 00:27:21,040
Tomorrow,

393
00:27:22,040 --> 00:27:23,040
everyone

394
00:27:24,040 --> 00:27:27,040
will turn into monsters.

395
00:27:35,040 --> 00:27:36,040
Shibiguo.

396
00:27:39,040 --> 00:27:41,040
You're still using the impurity?

397
00:27:41,040 --> 00:27:42,040
Wen Congyu,

398
00:27:43,040 --> 00:27:45,040
you have a deep pain in your waist.

399
00:27:45,040 --> 00:27:47,040
Now you choose to be a monster.

400
00:27:47,040 --> 00:27:48,040
You can't fool me.

401
00:27:48,040 --> 00:27:49,040
You're a monster too.

402
00:27:50,040 --> 00:27:52,040
Don't you think you can fool yourself?

403
00:27:54,040 --> 00:27:55,040
The monster hurt my love first,

404
00:27:56,040 --> 00:27:58,040
then killed my brother.

405
00:27:59,040 --> 00:28:00,040
The cruelest thing in this world

406
00:28:00,040 --> 00:28:01,040
is the monster.

407
00:28:01,040 --> 00:28:02,040
So I want to kill the monster.

408
00:28:02,040 --> 00:28:04,040
I want to kill all the monsters in the world.

409
00:28:07,040 --> 00:28:08,040
I'm just a human.

410
00:28:08,040 --> 00:28:09,040
I'm just a human.

411
00:28:10,040 --> 00:28:12,040
So I want to fight for my life

412
00:28:12,040 --> 00:28:14,040
to create a stronger and more powerful

413
00:28:14,040 --> 00:28:16,040
and more powerful monster.

414
00:28:16,040 --> 00:28:18,040
Your family is also being killed by monsters.

415
00:28:19,040 --> 00:28:21,040
Why don't you understand me?

416
00:28:22,040 --> 00:28:23,040
I understand you.

417
00:28:24,040 --> 00:28:26,040
You don't care about the people's wishes.

418
00:28:27,040 --> 00:28:28,040
You turn them into monsters

419
00:28:28,040 --> 00:28:30,040
who want to lose their mind.

420
00:28:30,040 --> 00:28:32,040
You even ask us to understand you.

421
00:28:34,040 --> 00:28:36,040
I'm doing this for them.

422
00:28:37,040 --> 00:28:39,040
The monster didn't suffer.

423
00:28:40,040 --> 00:28:42,040
It didn't have any pain.

424
00:28:43,040 --> 00:28:45,040
Only a strong power.

425
00:28:46,040 --> 00:28:47,040
I will lead them

426
00:28:47,040 --> 00:28:50,040
to the monster and fight for the world.

427
00:28:51,040 --> 00:28:53,040
To create a new world.

428
00:28:55,040 --> 00:28:56,040
Wenxiang,

429
00:28:56,040 --> 00:28:57,040
leave the village.

430
00:29:01,040 --> 00:29:02,040
Is this the end?

431
00:29:03,040 --> 00:29:05,040
Will you run away?

432
00:29:16,040 --> 00:29:17,040
Wenxiang.

433
00:29:30,040 --> 00:29:31,040
Wenxiang.

434
00:30:00,040 --> 00:30:02,040
The King of Phoenix,

435
00:30:02,040 --> 00:30:03,040
Keyu,

436
00:30:03,040 --> 00:30:05,040
Phoenix has a body of death.

437
00:30:06,040 --> 00:30:07,040
The fire is out of control.

438
00:30:08,040 --> 00:30:09,040
The more the fire is,

439
00:30:09,040 --> 00:30:10,040
the stronger it is.

440
00:30:11,040 --> 00:30:12,040
In the fire,

441
00:30:12,040 --> 00:30:14,040
we can't defeat it.

442
00:30:15,040 --> 00:30:16,040
The more powerful it is,

443
00:30:16,040 --> 00:30:17,040
the stronger it is.

444
00:30:18,040 --> 00:30:20,040
We can't defeat it.

445
00:30:21,040 --> 00:30:22,040
But we can defeat it.

446
00:30:23,040 --> 00:30:24,040
We can defeat it.

447
00:30:25,040 --> 00:30:26,040
You're right.

448
00:30:26,040 --> 00:30:27,040
In the fire,

449
00:30:28,040 --> 00:30:29,040
we can't defeat it.

450
00:30:30,040 --> 00:30:31,040
That's why I lead it to Kunlun Mountain.

451
00:30:31,040 --> 00:30:32,040
The place of ice.

452
00:30:33,040 --> 00:30:34,040
The monster's power is strong.

453
00:30:34,040 --> 00:30:35,040
It's like ice.

454
00:30:35,040 --> 00:30:36,040
It's like a fire.

455
00:30:36,040 --> 00:30:37,040
Xiao Zhuo.

456
00:30:37,040 --> 00:30:38,040
Do as I say.

457
00:30:41,040 --> 00:30:43,040
The sword is strong.

458
00:30:45,040 --> 00:30:47,040
The water is cold.

459
00:30:49,040 --> 00:30:50,040
The water is cold.

460
00:30:51,040 --> 00:30:52,040
The human body is weak.

461
00:30:52,040 --> 00:30:53,040
The human body is weak.

462
00:30:53,040 --> 00:30:54,040
The human body is weak.

463
00:30:55,040 --> 00:30:56,040
The human body is weak.

464
00:30:56,040 --> 00:30:57,040
The human body is weak.

465
00:31:24,040 --> 00:31:25,040
The sword is weak.

466
00:31:29,040 --> 00:31:30,040
It seems to be poisonous.

467
00:31:31,040 --> 00:31:32,040
It seems to be poisonous.

468
00:31:32,040 --> 00:31:33,040
Xiao Zhuo.

469
00:31:35,040 --> 00:31:36,040
Xiao Zhuo.

470
00:31:53,040 --> 00:31:54,040
Xiao Zhuo.

471
00:32:17,040 --> 00:32:18,040
Zhao Yanzhao.

472
00:32:23,040 --> 00:32:24,040
Zhao Yanzhao.

473
00:32:25,040 --> 00:32:27,040
You're really a good person.

474
00:32:27,040 --> 00:32:29,040
Why did you invite me here?

475
00:32:30,040 --> 00:32:31,040
Zhu Yan.

476
00:32:32,040 --> 00:32:33,040
Don't meet each other again.

477
00:32:34,040 --> 00:32:35,040
Don't drink a cup of tea.

478
00:32:37,040 --> 00:32:38,040
Zhu Yan.

479
00:32:39,040 --> 00:32:40,040
Zhu Yan.

480
00:32:41,040 --> 00:32:42,040
Zhu Yan.

481
00:32:43,040 --> 00:32:44,040
Zhu Yan.

482
00:32:45,040 --> 00:32:46,040
Zhu Yan.

483
00:32:47,040 --> 00:32:48,040
Zhu Yan.

484
00:32:49,040 --> 00:32:50,040
Zhu Yan.

485
00:32:51,040 --> 00:32:52,040
Zhu Yan.

486
00:32:53,040 --> 00:32:54,040
Zhu Yan.

487
00:32:55,040 --> 00:32:56,040
Zhu Yan.

488
00:32:57,040 --> 00:32:58,040
Zhu Yan.

489
00:33:00,040 --> 00:33:01,040
Zhu Yan.

490
00:33:02,040 --> 00:33:03,040
Zhu Yan.

491
00:33:07,040 --> 00:33:08,040
Xiao Zhuo.

492
00:33:09,040 --> 00:33:10,040
Let's go for a drink.

493
00:33:14,040 --> 00:33:15,040
There's wine here.

494
00:33:15,040 --> 00:33:16,040
Come.

495
00:33:17,040 --> 00:33:18,040
What wine do you want?

496
00:33:19,040 --> 00:33:20,040
Drink this.

497
00:33:20,040 --> 00:33:22,040
It's called the candle.

498
00:33:30,040 --> 00:33:31,040
Xiaojiu.

499
00:33:31,040 --> 00:33:32,040
Didn't you say

500
00:33:33,040 --> 00:33:35,040
you regretted the time you didn't have in your heart?

501
00:33:36,040 --> 00:33:37,040
Why are you unhappy now?

502
00:33:41,040 --> 00:33:42,040
Look carefully.

503
00:33:51,040 --> 00:33:52,040
I'll try again.

504
00:33:53,040 --> 00:33:54,040
You're injured.

505
00:33:55,040 --> 00:33:56,040
Let's go to the clinic today.

506
00:33:57,040 --> 00:33:58,040
It's just a minor injury.

507
00:33:58,040 --> 00:33:59,040
I'm a man.

508
00:33:59,040 --> 00:34:00,040
I can go with you.

509
00:34:01,040 --> 00:34:02,040
The next day,

510
00:34:03,040 --> 00:34:05,040
I'll teach you a lesson.

511
00:34:06,040 --> 00:34:07,040
Don't worry about it.

512
00:34:08,040 --> 00:34:09,040
Zhao Yanzhou.

513
00:34:11,040 --> 00:34:12,040
It's been a long time.

514
00:34:14,040 --> 00:34:16,040
Don't meet each other again.

515
00:34:17,040 --> 00:34:18,040
Drink a few more cups.

516
00:34:24,040 --> 00:34:25,040
Demon.

517
00:34:25,040 --> 00:34:26,040
Demon.

518
00:34:28,040 --> 00:34:29,040
Why are you here?

519
00:34:29,040 --> 00:34:31,040
Come and give me a push.

520
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:32,040
Demon.

521
00:34:33,040 --> 00:34:38,920
Why you without a

522
00:34:39,040 --> 00:34:40,040
heart?

523
00:34:53,040 --> 00:34:57,040
It's not easy to separate

524
00:34:57,040 --> 00:35:00,620
You can stay with me forever

525
00:35:02,540 --> 00:35:06,920
Look at the happy times now

526
00:35:16,540 --> 00:35:19,780
좋아

527
00:35:19,780 --> 00:35:24,260
I'm sweating in the summer, the winter's spring

528
00:35:24,260 --> 00:35:29,500
I don't want to miss, I don't want to be far away

529
00:35:29,500 --> 00:35:34,420
Who sees the young man who is lost

530
00:35:34,420 --> 00:35:38,860
You said you don't like to leave the old man

531
00:35:38,860 --> 00:35:41,260
I'm the one who likes to leave the old man

532
00:35:41,260 --> 00:35:44,220
If I'm the one who likes to leave the old man

533
00:35:44,220 --> 00:35:46,580
I can leave for a lifetime

534
00:35:46,580 --> 00:35:52,780
If you can really stay here for a lifetime

535
00:35:52,780 --> 00:35:54,860
It's good to be here

536
00:35:56,900 --> 00:35:59,380
But you know

537
00:35:59,380 --> 00:36:01,980
This is impossible

538
00:36:01,980 --> 00:36:04,940
I know

539
00:36:04,940 --> 00:36:07,500
But

540
00:36:07,500 --> 00:36:10,460
I also want to wake up to the dark

541
00:36:17,420 --> 00:36:19,980
因为要 trois scientist

542
00:36:22,520 --> 00:36:24,640
怎么办

543
00:36:31,400 --> 00:36:32,280
It's theJa

544
00:36:33,560 --> 00:36:36,440
The magnets that are burned out

545
00:36:36,440 --> 00:36:38,420
Shackles

546
00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:44,480
And the prova of cold

547
00:36:44,480 --> 00:36:47,920
This poison will create the biggest hope in our hearts.

548
00:36:49,480 --> 00:36:51,120
Let us, Chen Ni,

549
00:36:52,480 --> 00:36:54,920
be trapped in this endless dream.

550
00:36:56,840 --> 00:36:58,520
How can we wake up?

551
00:37:00,600 --> 00:37:01,640
Do you still remember

552
00:37:03,280 --> 00:37:05,040
the solution to the dream?

553
00:37:09,320 --> 00:37:10,160
I do.

554
00:37:14,600 --> 00:37:18,400
Do you wanna die?

555
00:37:18,640 --> 00:37:20,160
I'm not.

556
00:37:26,920 --> 00:37:27,840
What's wrong?

557
00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:45,480
If it's a war,

558
00:37:48,080 --> 00:37:49,280
it's not a dream.

559
00:37:50,760 --> 00:37:52,920
Zhao Wan'er and Lilun are dead long ago.

560
00:37:54,760 --> 00:37:56,760
How can it not be a dream?

561
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:01,520
Zhao Yanzhou,

562
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:03,200
wake up.

563
00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:17,880
The End

564
00:38:29,200 --> 00:38:29,720
Little Master,

565
00:38:29,800 --> 00:38:30,320
come on.

566
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:32,320
Little Nine,

567
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:33,280
why are you here?

568
00:38:33,520 --> 00:38:34,680
I went to the fire department to find you.

569
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:35,840
I heard you were here.

570
00:38:36,120 --> 00:38:37,760
You solved our Chen Ni's case.

571
00:38:38,480 --> 00:38:39,600
Thank you for your time.

572
00:38:40,280 --> 00:38:40,920
Bai Jiu.

573
00:38:42,960 --> 00:38:44,400
Are you going to fight with me?

574
00:38:45,120 --> 00:38:46,440
I know I'm not good at fighting,

575
00:38:46,840 --> 00:38:49,000
but I have to stand with my friends.

576
00:39:15,240 --> 00:39:16,320
Quiet,

577
00:39:16,920 --> 00:39:19,200
