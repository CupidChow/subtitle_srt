175
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:18,880
Do you know

176
00:14:19,430 --> 00:14:21,230
the flower language of laurels?

177
00:14:27,450 --> 00:14:29,780
Now, Mr. Zhang has suffered heavy losses.

178
00:14:29,870 --> 00:14:33,200
His wife suspected he was using money to care for a mistress.

179
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:35,720
He had no choice but to report to the authorities to arrest you.

180
00:14:35,720 --> 00:14:39,200
[Selling Grains]

181
00:14:36,070 --> 00:14:37,230
You old thing,

182
00:14:37,230 --> 00:14:38,390
you're shameless!

183
00:14:38,390 --> 00:14:39,330
I'm going to report this to the authorities.

184
00:14:39,330 --> 00:14:40,990
I'm going to report this to the authorities.

185
00:14:40,990 --> 00:14:42,700
As for the talented Wang?

186
00:14:43,230 --> 00:14:45,070
You deceived him and stole his heart.

187
00:14:45,070 --> 00:14:47,010
He's been devastated ever since,

188
00:14:47,230 --> 00:14:49,310
crying his eyes out every day.

189
00:14:53,400 --> 00:14:56,710
Beautiful women have always been fickle.

190
00:14:57,910 --> 00:14:58,990
Xiao'e,

191
00:14:59,830 --> 00:15:02,300
you're really something.

192
00:15:02,830 --> 00:15:05,030
Sister, don't listen to such nonsense.

193
00:15:05,030 --> 00:15:07,910
Mr. Zhang is known as a great philanthropist in the area.

194
00:15:07,910 --> 00:15:09,950
He heard this year's drought led to a poor harvest,

195
00:15:09,950 --> 00:15:11,390
so he spent a lot of money

196
00:15:11,390 --> 00:15:13,030
to stockpile grain from nearby towns

197
00:15:13,030 --> 00:15:14,290
and villages.

198
00:15:14,440 --> 00:15:16,390
He said it was for the people of Tiandu to have

199
00:15:16,390 --> 00:15:18,920
food in their bowls when grain became scarce.

200
00:15:19,030 --> 00:15:20,590
How could I possibly have deceived him?

201
00:15:20,590 --> 00:15:24,320
I swear if I had deceived a good person, I'd get struck by lightning.

202
00:15:31,060 --> 00:15:32,890
The rain is getting heavier.

203
00:15:33,190 --> 00:15:35,130
Why are you closing your umbrella?

204
00:15:35,390 --> 00:15:36,110
Yes.

205
00:15:36,630 --> 00:15:37,960
I understand now.

206
00:15:39,270 --> 00:15:40,670
Heaven understands too.

207
00:15:43,910 --> 00:15:45,630
Mr. Zhang is hoarding goods

208
00:15:45,630 --> 00:15:47,230
to make exorbitant profits.

209
00:15:47,270 --> 00:15:48,510
He's a profiteer.

210
00:15:52,960 --> 00:15:54,500
And what about Wang?

211
00:15:56,630 --> 00:15:58,030
Young Master Wang

212
00:15:58,080 --> 00:15:59,680
is incredibly talented.

213
00:15:59,870 --> 00:16:01,590
From courtesans in brothels

214
00:16:01,630 --> 00:16:03,200
to daughters of wealthy families,

215
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:06,330
everyone is captivated by his knowledge and character.

216
00:16:06,830 --> 00:16:09,290
Young Master Wang has admirers everywhere.

217
00:16:09,310 --> 00:16:10,070
For my sake,

218
00:16:10,070 --> 00:16:12,030
he abandoned his former lover.

219
00:16:12,270 --> 00:16:13,030
I see.

220
00:16:13,720 --> 00:16:15,540
Young Master Wang is fickle,

221
00:16:15,540 --> 00:16:16,590
hypocritical,

222
00:16:16,820 --> 00:16:18,390
and a scoundrel who is all show

223
00:16:18,390 --> 00:16:20,150
but no substance.

224
00:16:21,190 --> 00:16:22,350
What are you saying?

225
00:16:22,350 --> 00:16:24,160
Our love is true and strong.

226
00:16:24,990 --> 00:16:25,480
Yes.

227
00:16:25,660 --> 00:16:26,470
You two

228
00:16:26,530 --> 00:16:27,790
are just pretending.

229
00:16:28,530 --> 00:16:29,170
Let's go.

230
00:16:29,590 --> 00:16:31,870
I really haven't done anything wrong.

231
00:16:31,950 --> 00:16:33,430
You know very well

232
00:16:33,430 --> 00:16:34,670
that this is wrong.

233
00:16:35,230 --> 00:16:36,380
The world is full of all kinds of people,

234
00:16:36,380 --> 00:16:37,910
both good and evil.

235
00:16:38,110 --> 00:16:39,870
Bad people will face human laws

236
00:16:39,870 --> 00:16:41,800
and receive their due punishment.

237
00:16:41,990 --> 00:16:43,430
You've deceived people for money and lust.

238
00:16:43,430 --> 00:16:45,230
Although your initial intentions may have been good,

239
00:16:45,230 --> 00:16:47,230
you've still disturbed the peace of the mortal world.

240
00:16:47,230 --> 00:16:48,890
You should also face justice.

241
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:53,280
Don't worry. It's not a serious matter.

242
00:16:53,350 --> 00:16:54,190
You'll be imprisoned for a few months

243
00:16:54,190 --> 00:16:56,250
and then sent back to the Wilderness.

244
00:16:59,110 --> 00:17:00,710
Why are you so nervous?

245
00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:01,790
No.

246
00:17:01,870 --> 00:17:02,510
Sister,

247
00:17:02,630 --> 00:17:03,390
look.

248
00:17:05,190 --> 00:17:05,910
Hya!

249
00:17:06,710 --> 00:17:07,510
Hya!

250
00:17:09,030 --> 00:17:09,830
Hya!

251
00:17:11,030 --> 00:17:13,160
The people from Chongwu Camp are here.

252
00:17:14,700 --> 00:17:15,850
Easy.

253
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:19,200
Hand over the demon to us.

254
00:17:20,520 --> 00:17:22,580
I am the Archivist of the Demon Hunting Bureau.

255
00:17:22,580 --> 00:17:25,790
I have the authority to take the Deceptive Beast back to the Demon Hunting Bureau.

256
00:17:25,790 --> 00:17:27,250
The Demon Hunting Bureau?

257
00:17:27,900 --> 00:17:29,760
The moss and cobwebs in your courtyard

258
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:31,220
must be quite thick by now.

259
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:33,670
It's a dilapidated place that exists in name only.

260
00:17:33,670 --> 00:17:35,680
You dare to compete for authority with the Chongwu Camp?

261
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:36,540
Step aside now.

262
00:17:38,940 --> 00:17:40,150
The Deceptive Beast is weak

263
00:17:40,150 --> 00:17:41,810
and has little magical power.

264
00:17:42,069 --> 00:17:43,550
Although it lies,

265
00:17:43,569 --> 00:17:45,550
it only deceives those who do evil.

266
00:17:45,900 --> 00:17:48,000
It should be punished according to its crimes,

267
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,000
but its crimes don't warrant death.

268
00:17:50,420 --> 00:17:52,630
You were saved by a demon when you were young,

269
00:17:52,630 --> 00:17:54,710
so you've always had a soft spot for demons.

270
00:17:54,710 --> 00:17:57,370
As a result, you've let many evil demons escape.

271
00:17:58,060 --> 00:17:59,520
However, eight years ago,

272
00:17:59,590 --> 00:18:01,130
the extremely evil demon Zhu Yan

273
00:18:01,130 --> 00:18:03,530
caused heavy casualties to the Demon Hunting Bureau,

274
00:18:03,530 --> 00:18:05,140
almost destroying it.

275
00:18:05,630 --> 00:18:06,960
If he were here,

276
00:18:07,390 --> 00:18:09,560
would you still plead for him?

277
00:18:12,510 --> 00:18:14,040
The words of a vicious beast

278
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:16,620
are absolutely not to be trusted.

279
00:18:17,830 --> 00:18:18,990
Today,

280
00:18:20,110 --> 00:18:22,510
I will definitely kill you to take revenge.

281
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:26,990
My patience has run out.

282
00:18:27,010 --> 00:18:28,380
Mine ran out long ago.

283
00:18:29,650 --> 00:18:32,220
If Mr. Fan hadn't just appeared to stop me...

284
00:18:43,580 --> 00:18:45,120
You can kill me.

285
00:18:46,050 --> 00:18:48,830
But all the guards here—

286
00:18:50,850 --> 00:18:52,750
the four on the roof,

287
00:18:53,430 --> 00:18:55,940
seven behind the corridor,

288
00:18:56,650 --> 00:18:58,560
five by the pillars—

289
00:19:01,630 --> 00:19:03,590
a total of sixteen lives

290
00:19:03,590 --> 00:19:06,200
would all die with me.

291
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:10,710
Their hearts would burst and they would perish.

292
00:19:13,450 --> 00:19:15,050
Like this.

293
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:28,000
The demon beast Zhu Yan kills and does evil,

294
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:31,000
but the Chongwu Camp kills to stop killing.

295
00:19:31,010 --> 00:19:33,140
How is that any different from Zhu Yan?

296
00:19:33,350 --> 00:19:34,390
Enough talk.

297
00:19:34,910 --> 00:19:35,790
Attack!

298
00:19:54,550 --> 00:19:55,610
Sister,

299
00:19:56,110 --> 00:19:58,310
are you still acting at a time like this?

300
00:19:59,350 --> 00:20:00,870
I'm not acting.

301
00:20:01,560 --> 00:20:02,860
Are you alright?

302
00:20:04,580 --> 00:20:05,590
Go.

303
00:20:11,340 --> 00:20:12,130
Go!

304
00:20:13,790 --> 00:20:14,580
Go!

305
00:20:29,210 --> 00:20:30,450
Hurry!

306
00:20:55,960 --> 00:20:57,820
The Chongwu Camp is ordered to eliminate demons.

307
00:20:57,820 --> 00:20:59,340
It is our duty.

308
00:20:59,370 --> 00:21:00,850
Weapons are merciless.

309
00:21:00,950 --> 00:21:03,630
You people from the Demon Hunting Bureau insist on obstructing us.

310
00:21:03,630 --> 00:21:07,150
Any injuries sustained are not the responsibility of the Chongwu Camp.

311
00:21:07,150 --> 00:21:08,110
Farewell.

312
00:21:08,790 --> 00:21:09,630
Hya!

313
00:21:10,070 --> 00:21:10,710
Hya!

314
00:21:14,990 --> 00:21:15,860
Sister.

315
00:21:20,650 --> 00:21:21,710
Thank you.

316
00:21:25,670 --> 00:21:27,190
Are you blaming me?

317
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:37,760
Indeed, it is my fault.

318
00:21:40,950 --> 00:21:41,830
I'm sorry.

319
00:21:44,210 --> 00:21:45,880
I'm too useless.

♫A dream♫

345
00:23:01,550 --> 00:23:02,850
♫A pair of hands♫

346
00:23:03,070 --> 00:23:05,160
♫A cup of wine♫

347
00:23:06,910 --> 00:23:08,440
I'll count down from three.

348
00:23:09,070 --> 00:23:11,320
Will you sheathe your sword or not?

349
00:23:13,590 --> 00:23:14,590
Three.

350
00:23:19,230 --> 00:23:20,230
Two.

351
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:26,430
One.

352
00:23:39,470 --> 00:23:40,590
Does it feel bad?

353
00:23:41,550 --> 00:23:43,220
Good.

354
00:23:44,270 --> 00:23:46,140
Nine out of ten

355
00:23:47,230 --> 00:23:48,910
worldly affairs

356
00:23:49,510 --> 00:23:51,510
don't go according to one's wishes.

357
00:23:53,010 --> 00:23:54,160
Mr. Zhuo,

358
00:23:56,540 --> 00:23:58,310
you'd better get used to it.

359
00:23:58,910 --> 00:24:00,500
You despicable villain!

360
00:24:01,880 --> 00:24:03,430
One day,

361
00:24:04,180 --> 00:24:06,000
I will use the Cloud Light Sword

362
00:24:07,040 --> 00:24:09,150
to pierce your heart.

363
00:24:19,970 --> 00:24:21,710
Like this?

364
00:24:23,910 --> 00:24:26,170
I already told you earlier.

365
00:24:28,070 --> 00:24:28,780
You

366
00:24:30,840 --> 00:24:32,750
can't kill me.

367
00:24:36,670 --> 00:24:37,790
Zhu Yan!

368
00:24:37,810 --> 00:24:38,610
What's wrong?

369
00:24:38,680 --> 00:24:40,720
Does it feel even worse now?

370
00:24:44,790 --> 00:24:45,820
Zhuo,

371
00:24:46,580 --> 00:24:48,710
the bigger picture is more important.

372
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:50,780
Zhu Yan,

373
00:24:51,400 --> 00:24:53,760
what exactly are you up to?

374
00:25:11,300 --> 00:25:14,960
You proposed to the court to rebuild the Demon Hunting Bureau.

375
00:25:15,720 --> 00:25:18,720
Although the Prime Minister strongly vouched for it,

376
00:25:19,410 --> 00:25:21,990
the Chongwu Camp is interfering.

377
00:25:22,630 --> 00:25:24,960
King Xiang hasn't given his approval yet.

378
00:25:25,270 --> 00:25:26,950
I came here today

379
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:30,750
to give you a gift.

380
00:25:33,990 --> 00:25:35,590
What gift?

381
00:25:38,470 --> 00:25:39,340
Me.

382
00:25:41,610 --> 00:25:43,720
Capture the great demon Zhu Yan

383
00:25:44,990 --> 00:25:47,020
and bring him to justice.

384
00:25:47,800 --> 00:25:49,610
Get your credit and reward.

385
00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:55,200
Mr. Zhuo,

386
00:25:56,740 --> 00:25:57,930
are you satisfied

387
00:25:58,950 --> 00:26:00,720
with this gift?

388
00:26:00,750 --> 00:26:02,740
Not satisfied enough.

389
00:26:03,650 --> 00:26:05,160
Still not enough?

390
00:26:07,980 --> 00:26:10,220
You are truly greedy.

391
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:15,750
Then how can I satisfy you?

392
00:26:17,630 --> 00:26:18,910
Are you satisfied now?

393
00:26:20,150 --> 00:26:21,990
I will kill you sooner or later.

394
00:26:26,750 --> 00:26:28,010
I hope you

395
00:26:28,650 --> 00:26:29,840
will keep your word.

396
00:26:43,710 --> 00:26:44,440
Ms. Wen,

397
00:26:44,500 --> 00:26:45,830
you're finally back.

398
00:26:45,950 --> 00:26:47,560
Why is your face so pale?

399
00:26:47,830 --> 00:26:49,080
Is something wrong?

400
00:26:50,710 --> 00:26:51,350
A demon.

401
00:26:52,650 --> 00:26:53,850
There's a demon here?

402
00:26:56,700 --> 00:26:58,480
If there is a demon in the Demon Hunting Bureau,

403
00:26:58,480 --> 00:27:00,340
then this demon must be very bold.

404
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:02,120
Not only is he bold,

405
00:27:02,300 --> 00:27:03,830
he's big all over.

406
00:27:04,800 --> 00:27:05,970
He's a great demon.

407
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:08,170
Oh.

408
00:27:08,620 --> 00:27:10,020
What kind of great demon?

409
00:27:10,380 --> 00:27:11,190
I don't know,

410
00:27:11,960 --> 00:27:13,780
but I heard Mr. Zhuo call him…

411
00:27:14,890 --> 00:27:15,780
Call him...

412
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:18,010
Call him Zhu Yan.

413
00:27:43,880 --> 00:27:45,250
He has a first and last name.

414
00:27:45,250 --> 00:27:46,750
His household registration can be checked.

415
00:27:46,750 --> 00:27:48,340
He's a resident of Tiandu.

416
00:27:48,360 --> 00:27:49,580
Zhao Yuanzhou,

417
00:27:49,700 --> 00:27:51,170
twenty-nine years old.

418
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:53,030
He really is a demon.

419
00:27:53,240 --> 00:27:54,640
An extremely evil demon.

420
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:56,390
His cultivation is profound.

421
00:27:56,390 --> 00:27:57,760
Taking human form

422
00:27:58,030 --> 00:27:59,430
is not difficult for him.

423
00:28:00,430 --> 00:28:02,000
Why can't your Cloud Light Sword

424
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:03,280
kill him?

425
00:28:04,670 --> 00:28:05,400
I don't know.

426
00:28:05,890 --> 00:28:07,120
Do you want to know?

427
00:28:10,930 --> 00:28:13,030
You're eavesdropping on our conversation.

428
00:28:13,030 --> 00:28:13,870
Despicable.

429
00:28:15,030 --> 00:28:16,030
Eavesdropping?

430
00:28:16,510 --> 00:28:18,080
I didn't even move.

431
00:28:18,200 --> 00:28:20,290
Mr. Fan and I were whispering,

432
00:28:20,360 --> 00:28:21,650
yet you could hear us.

433
00:28:22,800 --> 00:28:24,530
You're not a monkey.

434
00:28:24,790 --> 00:28:25,700
You're a dog.

435
00:28:25,810 --> 00:28:27,870
I think dogs have a sharp sense of smell.

436
00:28:27,870 --> 00:28:28,400
You—

437
00:28:28,900 --> 00:28:30,230
Mr. Zhuo, don't forget.

438
00:28:30,670 --> 00:28:32,710
I am a thousand-year-old great demon.

439
00:28:32,710 --> 00:28:34,350
My five senses are extraordinary.

440
00:28:34,350 --> 00:28:36,150
No matter how far away you stand,

441
00:28:36,500 --> 00:28:39,490
it's as if you're...

442
00:28:41,970 --> 00:28:43,860
whispering right next to my ear.

443
00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:45,020
How dare you!

444
00:28:45,160 --> 00:28:46,820
Who's whispering in your ear?

445
00:28:49,130 --> 00:28:51,130
Do you want to know the answer or not?

446
00:28:51,150 --> 00:28:52,720
You keep getting off topic.

447
00:28:52,950 --> 00:28:54,030
So annoying.

448
00:28:56,160 --> 00:28:57,760
Just say what you have to say.

449
00:28:58,500 --> 00:29:00,700
You are a descendant of the Bingyi Clan.

450
00:29:02,850 --> 00:29:04,390
The bloodline of the Bingyi Clan

451
00:29:04,390 --> 00:29:07,720
has always been the nemesis of the demons of the Wilderness.

452
00:29:08,460 --> 00:29:09,830
The power of the Cloud Light Sword

453
00:29:09,830 --> 00:29:12,100
is enough to slay gods and demons.

454
00:29:12,430 --> 00:29:13,360
However…

455
00:29:18,100 --> 00:29:19,130
However what?

456
00:29:20,560 --> 00:29:22,220
You're using it incorrectly.

457
00:29:25,570 --> 00:29:26,630
How should I use it?

458
00:29:27,790 --> 00:29:30,320
This is the highest secret of the Bingyi Clan.

459
00:29:30,470 --> 00:29:33,070
I must whisper it to Mr. Zhuo.

460
00:29:33,370 --> 00:29:35,500
It must not be overheard by outsiders.

461
00:29:40,280 --> 00:29:42,010
What a pity about these chains.

462
00:29:43,240 --> 00:29:44,040
Zhuo.

463
00:29:46,200 --> 00:29:47,430
Demons are cunning.

464
00:29:47,430 --> 00:29:48,390
Don't be fooled.

465
00:29:48,680 --> 00:29:49,600
Zhao Yuanzhou.

466
00:29:49,660 --> 00:29:51,270
You said in your letter

467
00:29:51,290 --> 00:29:52,730
that you could help the Demon Hunting Bureau

468
00:29:52,730 --> 00:29:54,190
solve the recent cases in Tiandu City

469
00:29:54,190 --> 00:29:57,190
of water ghosts abducting brides and killing people.

470
00:29:57,390 --> 00:29:58,950
Is this true?

471
00:29:59,030 --> 00:30:00,250
Why would you help the Demon Hunting Bureau

472
00:30:00,250 --> 00:30:01,770
for no good reason?

473
00:30:01,940 --> 00:30:03,800
You must have an ulterior motive.

474
00:30:04,100 --> 00:30:05,810
I have no desires or demands.

475
00:30:05,950 --> 00:30:08,810
I sincerely want to help the Demon Hunting Bureau.

476
00:30:09,540 --> 00:30:11,270
For many years, the Chongwu Camp

477
00:30:11,270 --> 00:30:13,380
has been wantonly slaughtering demons and beasts.

478
00:30:13,380 --> 00:30:14,640
As a great demon,

479
00:30:15,390 --> 00:30:18,020
I naturally want to help the lesser demons take revenge.

480
00:30:18,020 --> 00:30:19,260
The enemy of my enemy

481
00:30:19,510 --> 00:30:20,550
is my friend.

482
00:30:21,230 --> 00:30:22,390
This is written in

483
00:30:22,390 --> 00:30:24,000
your human military strategy,

484
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:24,810
right?

485
00:30:26,790 --> 00:30:28,070
But eight years ago,

486
00:30:29,150 --> 00:30:30,710
the Demon Hunting Bureau was destroyed

487
00:30:30,710 --> 00:30:32,640
and the Chongwu Camp gained power.

488
00:30:34,730 --> 00:30:37,200
This was all thanks to you.

489
00:30:39,630 --> 00:30:42,190
The deep feud for killing my father and brothers

490
00:30:42,190 --> 00:30:43,960
is something I must avenge.

491
00:30:45,670 --> 00:30:48,010
Anyone can help the Demon Hunting Bureau,

492
00:30:50,590 --> 00:30:52,350
except you.

493
00:30:53,730 --> 00:30:55,960
Don't you mortals have a saying

494
00:30:56,590 --> 00:30:57,230
that goes,

495
00:30:58,070 --> 00:30:59,820
"To know one's fault and be willing to change

496
00:30:59,820 --> 00:31:01,320
is the greatest virtue"?

497
00:31:04,920 --> 00:31:08,050
Are you really willing to help the Demon Hunting Bureau?

498
00:31:09,340 --> 00:31:10,960
I'll give my all

499
00:31:11,220 --> 00:31:13,080
and dedicate myself completely.

500
00:31:14,620 --> 00:31:16,350
However, I have one condition.

501
00:31:18,300 --> 00:31:20,700
You just said you had no desires or demands.

502
00:31:21,630 --> 00:31:23,560
Indeed, your mouth is full of lies.

503
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:24,860
What's the condition?

504
00:31:26,990 --> 00:31:29,450
I want someone from the Demon Hunting Bureau

505
00:31:30,620 --> 00:31:32,880
to accompany me in investigating cases.

506
00:31:33,860 --> 00:31:34,980
Who?

507
00:31:36,740 --> 00:31:38,310
It's someone you both know.

508
00:31:39,630 --> 00:31:41,480
Commander Fan Ying,

509
00:31:41,550 --> 00:31:43,030
it's your daughter,

510
00:31:44,530 --> 00:31:46,230
Ms. Wen Xiao.

511
00:31:49,460 --> 00:31:50,720
Mr. Zhuo has ordered

512
00:31:50,750 --> 00:31:52,950
that no one is allowed near the dungeon.

513
00:31:53,070 --> 00:31:54,220
Not even me?

514
00:31:54,760 --> 00:31:56,230
Not even you, Ms. Wen.

515
00:31:59,150 --> 00:32:00,300
Don't even think about it.

516
00:32:00,300 --> 00:32:01,760
Don't even think about it?

517
00:32:02,650 --> 00:32:04,310
Not only will I think about it,

518
00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:06,080
but I will also do it.

519
00:32:08,680 --> 00:32:10,600
I'm the one making demands now.

520
00:32:12,070 --> 00:32:14,640
You have no right to say no.

521
00:32:17,910 --> 00:32:18,870
How dare you!

522
00:32:58,750 --> 00:32:59,550
Dream.

523
00:33:01,830 --> 00:33:02,690
Zhao Yuanzhou!

524
00:33:05,990 --> 00:33:06,790
Protect.

525
00:33:25,140 --> 00:33:25,950
Dream.

526
00:33:43,060 --> 00:33:44,060
Do you like

527
00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:45,890
this meeting gift?

528
00:33:49,560 --> 00:33:50,930
Master!

529
00:33:51,640 --> 00:33:52,940
Master!

530
00:34:26,740 --> 00:34:28,740
Why is there blood on the flowers?

531
00:34:35,920 --> 00:34:38,060
Is it Master's blood?

532
00:34:52,860 --> 00:34:54,270
A mortal woman

533
00:34:54,560 --> 00:34:56,060
being so forward.

534
00:34:57,980 --> 00:34:59,510
My body feels weak.

535
00:34:59,909 --> 00:35:01,159
That's why I fell.

536
00:35:01,520 --> 00:35:03,520
Please don't take offense, my lord.

537
00:35:04,090 --> 00:35:05,420
You're not afraid of me?

538
00:35:06,139 --> 00:35:07,460
Why should I be afraid?

539
00:35:10,429 --> 00:35:11,630
I am a demon.

540
00:35:13,500 --> 00:35:14,770
I know.

541
00:35:15,190 --> 00:35:16,150
Great Demon,

542
00:35:16,190 --> 00:35:17,139
Zhu Yan.

543
00:35:20,820 --> 00:35:22,520
You look familiar.

544
00:35:23,840 --> 00:35:25,790
Have we met somewhere before?

545
00:35:27,370 --> 00:35:28,710
How cliché.

546
00:35:29,510 --> 00:35:30,830
Are you being serious?

547
00:35:33,290 --> 00:35:34,130
Hello.

548
00:35:35,010 --> 00:35:36,280
My name is Wen Xiao.

549
00:35:37,660 --> 00:35:38,500
Hello.

550
00:35:38,920 --> 00:35:40,320
My name is Zhao Yuanzhou.

551
00:35:43,040 --> 00:35:45,440
I didn't expect Mr. Zhu Yan to have an alias.

552
00:35:46,680 --> 00:35:48,790
Even a mere cunning rabbit has three burrows.

553
00:35:48,790 --> 00:35:50,000
As a great demon,

554
00:35:50,030 --> 00:35:51,160
having a few aliases

555
00:35:51,520 --> 00:35:52,920
is nothing to brag about.

556
00:35:53,440 --> 00:35:54,830
Mr. Zhao Yuanzhou,

557
00:35:55,070 --> 00:35:56,670
my legs aren't weak anymore.

558
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:58,440
You can help me up now.

559
00:35:59,670 --> 00:36:00,510
Alright.

560
00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:04,110
Zhu Yan,

561
00:36:04,130 --> 00:36:05,080
let her go.

562
00:36:12,030 --> 00:36:13,030
Did you hear that?

563
00:36:13,030 --> 00:36:14,650
He wants you to let me go.

564
00:36:14,840 --> 00:36:15,800
No way.

565
00:36:17,980 --> 00:36:20,610
Even Mr. Zhuo's Cloud Light Sword couldn't kill me.

566
00:36:20,610 --> 00:36:22,240
Your little dagger—

567
00:36:26,710 --> 00:36:27,780
You won't die,

568
00:36:27,810 --> 00:36:29,150
but it will still hurt, won't it?

569
00:36:29,150 --> 00:36:30,840
Playing dirty, huh?

570
00:36:32,370 --> 00:36:33,820
Then I'll also—

571
00:36:39,470 --> 00:36:41,120
What did you put on the blade?

572
00:36:41,140 --> 00:36:42,400
A sedative for demons,

573
00:36:42,410 --> 00:36:43,530
Huanling Powder.

574
00:36:44,270 --> 00:36:45,280
Tit for tat.

575
00:36:45,850 --> 00:36:47,530
Your flower is beautiful.

576
00:36:47,640 --> 00:36:48,940
I'll take it.

577
00:36:55,270 --> 00:36:57,160
The Huanling Powder won't hold him for long.

578
00:36:57,160 --> 00:36:59,290
Quickly, lock him back in the dungeon.

579
00:37:01,480 --> 00:37:02,240
The dungeon

580
00:37:02,670 --> 00:37:03,740
can't hold him.

581
00:37:06,340 --> 00:37:08,370
He just escaped from there.

582
00:37:11,690 --> 00:37:12,510
Is that so?

583
00:37:18,160 --> 00:37:20,100
Then keep slashing him with the knife.

584
00:37:20,100 --> 00:37:20,990
No, no, no.

585
00:37:21,500 --> 00:37:22,360
Don't slash me.

586
00:37:22,830 --> 00:37:23,930
I'll go back myself.

587
00:37:23,930 --> 00:37:25,130
I promise I won't run.

588
00:37:25,530 --> 00:37:26,730
I'll go back on my own.

589
00:37:27,400 --> 00:37:28,330
Thank you.

590
00:37:32,730 --> 00:37:33,830
I can walk by myself.

591
00:37:33,830 --> 00:37:34,590
Thank you.

592
00:37:45,480 --> 00:37:46,350
Ms. Wen,

593
00:37:46,370 --> 00:37:48,040
here's the demon catalog you asked me to find.

594
00:37:48,040 --> 00:37:48,880
The information on Deceptive Beasts

595
00:37:48,880 --> 00:37:50,080
is all recorded here.

596
00:37:57,120 --> 00:37:58,360
You may go now.

597
00:37:58,380 --> 00:37:59,110
Ms. Wen,

598
00:37:59,220 --> 00:38:00,110
your wound...

599
00:38:00,250 --> 00:38:01,050
It's nothing.

600
00:38:33,790 --> 00:38:35,370
Fierce as a wrathful deity,

601
00:38:36,110 --> 00:38:37,350
engulfed in flames.

602
00:38:39,300 --> 00:38:41,220
Sir, this painting of Zhu Rong

603
00:38:41,250 --> 00:38:42,950
is so lifelike.

604
00:38:43,960 --> 00:38:45,580
My brushwork is ordinary.

605
00:38:46,490 --> 00:38:48,950
This painting excels in its vibrant colors.

606
00:38:51,910 --> 00:38:52,910
Good paint.

607
00:38:54,750 --> 00:38:56,790
It really is good paint.

608
00:38:59,930 --> 00:39:02,260
I heard they caught Zhu Yan.

609
00:39:02,760 --> 00:39:05,090
Zhu Yan is a great demon of the Wilderness.

610
00:39:05,490 --> 00:39:06,580
If he

611
00:39:07,150 --> 00:39:08,840
truly becomes our enemy...

612
00:39:10,440 --> 00:39:11,950
There's no need to worry.

613
00:39:12,750 --> 00:39:15,610
The Demon Hunting Bureau is just a pack of lost dogs.

614
00:39:15,630 --> 00:39:17,790
All I want is Zhao Yuanzhou.

615
00:39:18,240 --> 00:39:21,080
Since he's delivered himself to our doorstep,

616
00:39:21,860 --> 00:39:24,760
my grand plan, years in the making,

617
00:39:26,240 --> 00:39:29,180
can finally be brought to reality.

with a human face that speaks well,

621
00:39:40,330 --> 00:39:41,710
saying one thing but meaning another,

622
00:39:41,710 --> 00:39:43,070
speaking of evil but meaning good.

623
00:39:43,070 --> 00:39:44,630
Born as a Deceptive Beast,

624

they are destined to speak against their will.

625
