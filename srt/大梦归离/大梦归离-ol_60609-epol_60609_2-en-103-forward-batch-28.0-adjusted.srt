[Episode 2]

3
00:02:18,630 --> 00:02:19,490
Archivist Wen,

4
00:02:19,630 --> 00:02:21,430
how come you're bleeding again?

5
00:02:33,990 --> 00:02:35,100
I need to go out.

6
00:02:52,270 --> 00:02:55,000
I waited for you so long that I almost fell asleep.

7
00:02:55,110 --> 00:02:56,310
You knew I would come?

8
00:02:57,990 --> 00:02:59,980
I know you can't let it go.

9
00:03:00,430 --> 00:03:02,000
I can't let go of your life.

10
00:03:03,030 --> 00:03:05,890
You have the blood of countless lives on your hands.

11
00:03:06,150 --> 00:03:07,710
Even your death is not enough.

12
00:03:07,710 --> 00:03:09,579
So you were bound to come.

13
00:03:10,670 --> 00:03:14,270
Because you want to know the true way to use the Cloud Light Sword.

14
00:03:15,850 --> 00:03:17,250
I can tell you.

15
00:03:18,190 --> 00:03:19,590
But you have conditions.

16
00:03:20,950 --> 00:03:21,750
Yes.

17
00:03:23,870 --> 00:03:25,140
What do you want?

18
00:03:25,829 --> 00:03:27,829
I want a vow from you.

19
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:30,430
Make a solemn vow.

20
00:03:31,270 --> 00:03:32,870
Never to go back on your word.

21
00:03:34,430 --> 00:03:35,440
What do you want me

22
00:03:35,910 --> 00:03:36,910
to do?

23
00:03:43,270 --> 00:03:45,030
I want you to kill me.

24
00:03:45,810 --> 00:03:48,870
I'll teach you the true way to use the Cloud Light Sword.

25
00:03:49,180 --> 00:03:50,280
Then...

26
00:03:52,390 --> 00:03:53,710
Kill me.

27
00:04:00,630 --> 00:04:01,890
You really want to die?

28
00:04:03,230 --> 00:04:04,070
Yes.

29
00:04:05,470 --> 00:04:07,740
And I must die by your hand.

30
00:04:09,990 --> 00:04:11,350
I don't understand.

31
00:04:11,990 --> 00:04:13,190
If you want to die,

32
00:04:14,070 --> 00:04:15,670
there are thousands of ways.

33
00:04:16,820 --> 00:04:18,780
Why must I be the one to kill you?

34
00:04:20,950 --> 00:04:23,260
People call me an extremely evil demon.

35
00:04:23,390 --> 00:04:24,940
Why do you think that is?

36
00:04:25,370 --> 00:04:27,190
It's obviously because you've committed numerous evil deeds.

37
00:04:27,190 --> 00:04:28,650
You're extremely brutal.

38
00:04:29,710 --> 00:04:32,440
Mr. Zhuo, don't believe those rumors.

39
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:33,760
What?

40
00:04:34,510 --> 00:04:36,910
Don't tell me you're actually a good demon?

41
00:04:38,830 --> 00:04:39,630
No.

42
00:04:41,430 --> 00:04:43,270
I'm more vicious and eviler

43
00:04:43,940 --> 00:04:44,870
than rumors say.

44
00:04:45,750 --> 00:04:48,350
Not only do I absorb the world's malicious energy,

45
00:04:48,350 --> 00:04:50,910
but I'm also a vessel that contains it.

46
00:04:53,870 --> 00:04:55,410
Do you know what malicious energy is?

47
00:04:55,410 --> 00:04:56,600
Of course I do.

48
00:04:58,230 --> 00:05:00,030
It can destroy heaven and earth.

49
00:05:00,510 --> 00:05:01,770
It can make the world

50
00:05:01,790 --> 00:05:02,790
dark and sunless,

51
00:05:04,030 --> 00:05:05,690
and be littered with corpses.

52
00:05:06,030 --> 00:05:06,870
So,

53
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:08,510
when I die,

54
00:05:09,350 --> 00:05:10,430
a new vessel

55
00:05:10,430 --> 00:05:13,300
will immediately be born in the world

56
00:05:13,909 --> 00:05:15,030
to replace me

57
00:05:15,030 --> 00:05:18,030
and contain and absorb the endless malicious energy.

58
00:05:20,390 --> 00:05:22,070
And whether the new vessel

59
00:05:22,510 --> 00:05:24,320
is good or evil

60
00:05:24,620 --> 00:05:26,260
righteous or wicked,

61
00:05:26,830 --> 00:05:28,270
can't be predicted.

62
00:05:32,150 --> 00:05:33,520
Your Cloud Light Sword

63
00:05:33,950 --> 00:05:36,860
can dispel all evil spirits and demons.

64
00:05:37,730 --> 00:05:39,670
Dying by your sword

65
00:05:40,660 --> 00:05:43,750
can end the vessels' reincarnation cycle.

66
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:53,320
I, Zhuo Yichen,

67
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:55,960
swear to the heavens

68
00:05:58,170 --> 00:05:59,600
that as long as Zhu Yan

69
00:05:59,630 --> 00:06:02,780
teaches me the true way to use the Cloud Light Sword,

70
00:06:03,610 --> 00:06:06,340
I will surely slay him with my sword.

71
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:09,280
If I break this vow,

72
00:06:10,700 --> 00:06:12,500
may heaven and earth destroy me,

73
00:06:13,230 --> 00:06:14,630
and my soul be scattered.

74
00:06:18,630 --> 00:06:19,790
Very good.

75
00:06:33,170 --> 00:06:34,420
What's going on?

76
00:06:34,980 --> 00:06:36,240
What happened?

77
00:06:37,870 --> 00:06:38,460
Well...

78
00:06:38,490 --> 00:06:40,310
I don't know what happened either.

79
00:06:40,310 --> 00:06:41,670
When Commander Zhuo came just now,

80
00:06:41,670 --> 00:06:42,870
he was fine.

81
00:06:43,110 --> 00:06:44,350
Commander Zhuo was here?

82
00:06:44,350 --> 00:06:45,160
He just left.

83
00:06:48,870 --> 00:06:49,690
Open the door.

84
00:06:49,810 --> 00:06:50,470
Yes.

85
00:06:51,910 --> 00:06:53,010

87
00:06:53,110 --> 00:06:54,310
we need to select

88
00:06:54,310 --> 00:06:56,110
an elite force to lead the charge

89
00:06:56,110 --> 00:06:59,100
to quickly solve the Water Ghost's wedding murder case.

90
00:06:59,100 --> 00:07:01,710
This is the list of candidates drafted by the Prime Minister.

91
00:07:01,710 --> 00:07:03,270
Each of them possesses extraordinary skills

92
00:07:03,270 --> 00:07:04,350
and they are unwaveringly loyal.

93
00:07:04,350 --> 00:07:05,620
There are twenty-eight people in total.

94
00:07:05,620 --> 00:07:07,130
Five will suffice.

95
00:07:07,190 --> 00:07:07,990
Quantity over quality

96
00:07:07,990 --> 00:07:09,050
is useless.

97
00:07:09,670 --> 00:07:11,510
I have prepared five tokens.

98
00:07:12,110 --> 00:07:14,430
Two of them have already been handed to them.

99

[Demon Hunting Bureau]

100
00:07:18,710 --> 00:07:19,700
These two

101
00:07:19,700 --> 00:07:22,240
are not on the Prime Minister's list.

102
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:14,210
Get up.

103
00:08:14,710 --> 00:08:15,720
Stop pretending.

104
00:08:23,070 --> 00:08:25,930
I didn't expect Ms. Wen Xiao to care so much about me.

105
00:08:26,230 --> 00:08:28,080
I can't help but feel touched.

106
00:08:31,180 --> 00:08:33,640
I'm already up and you're still stabbing me?

107
00:08:35,190 --> 00:08:36,340
Just in case.

108
00:08:36,420 --> 00:08:38,150
I'll give you a small cut first.

109
00:08:38,470 --> 00:08:40,100
There's Huanling Powder on the blade.

110
00:08:40,100 --> 00:08:42,160
It can suppress your demonic powers.

111
00:08:42,630 --> 00:08:43,580
Otherwise,

112
00:08:43,710 --> 00:08:45,310
I'm afraid you might hurt me.

113
00:08:45,710 --> 00:08:48,050
You're the one who's been hurting me.

114
00:08:49,390 --> 00:08:50,950
Humans and demons should keep their distance.

115
00:08:50,950 --> 00:08:52,350
Why are you here to see me?

116
00:08:52,630 --> 00:08:53,560
I'm here

117
00:08:53,630 --> 00:08:54,790
to give you a gift.

118
00:08:58,390 --> 00:09:00,990
It seems Mr. Fan Ying has accepted my proposal.

119
00:09:02,190 --> 00:09:03,880
It'll be impolite not to reciprocate.

120
00:09:03,880 --> 00:09:05,700
I'm a very polite person.

121
00:09:05,990 --> 00:09:06,809
Tell me,

122
00:09:07,190 --> 00:09:08,350
what do you want?

123
00:09:09,030 --> 00:09:10,190
I want an answer.

124
00:09:11,429 --> 00:09:12,600
What did

125
00:09:12,950 --> 00:09:14,550
Zhuo come to see you for?

126
00:09:23,390 --> 00:09:25,200
Why do you care so much about him?

127
00:09:26,030 --> 00:09:28,870
He's just an ordinary mortal man.

128
00:09:31,630 --> 00:09:32,470
Zhuo

129
00:09:32,470 --> 00:09:34,280
is no ordinary man.

130
00:09:34,590 --> 00:09:35,810
Zhuo?

131
00:09:36,190 --> 00:09:37,350
Zhuo.

132
00:09:46,870 --> 00:09:47,830
What's going on?

133
00:09:48,190 --> 00:09:49,850
Are you going to tell me or not?

134
00:09:50,910 --> 00:09:53,470
This is an agreement between Commander Zhuo and me.

135
00:09:53,470 --> 00:09:54,620
It's a secret.

136
00:09:55,110 --> 00:09:57,000
How can I easily tell others?

137
00:09:57,590 --> 00:09:58,550
Others?

138
00:09:59,190 --> 00:10:00,600
Mr. Zhao Yuanzhou,

139
00:10:00,670 --> 00:10:02,110
you specifically named me

140
00:10:02,110 --> 00:10:03,600
to hunt demons together.

141
00:10:03,940 --> 00:10:05,700
Now you call me

142
00:10:05,830 --> 00:10:06,780
"others"?

143
00:10:08,070 --> 00:10:08,870
That's right.

144
00:10:09,370 --> 00:10:11,100
You're not happy about

145
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:13,170
hunting demons with me?

146
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:14,470
Nope.

147
00:10:15,710 --> 00:10:16,990
Mortal women

148
00:10:16,990 --> 00:10:18,790
all say one thing and mean another.

149
00:10:18,790 --> 00:10:21,260
You seem to know a lot about mortal women.

150
00:10:21,310 --> 00:10:23,040
I know a thing or two, I suppose.

151
00:10:23,270 --> 00:10:25,670
Don't you also carry a pen and notebook every day

152
00:10:25,670 --> 00:10:27,550
to study us demons of the Wilderness?

153
00:10:27,550 --> 00:10:28,350
You and I,

154
00:10:28,610 --> 00:10:30,210
we're not so different.

155
00:10:30,920 --> 00:10:33,580
How much have you been snooping around about me?

156
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:38,320
If I hadn't specifically requested it,

157
00:10:38,790 --> 00:10:40,990
I'm afraid with your weak and frail body

158
00:10:41,030 --> 00:10:43,030
that could be blown over by the wind,

159
00:10:43,110 --> 00:10:46,110
you'd never make it into the Demon Hunting Squad in your lifetime.

160
00:10:46,110 --> 00:10:48,150
When did I ever say I wanted to join?

161
00:10:48,150 --> 00:10:48,910
See?

162
00:10:49,350 --> 00:10:50,110
See?

163
00:10:50,550 --> 00:10:52,720
The storybooks were right after all.

164
00:10:52,870 --> 00:10:53,770
Women

165
00:10:53,910 --> 00:10:56,040
always say one thing and mean another.

166
00:10:56,550 --> 00:10:57,550
Before I came here,

167
00:10:57,550 --> 00:10:59,410
I had already inquired about you.

168
00:10:59,670 --> 00:11:02,400
Ms. Wen Xiao is dedicated to helping demons,

169
00:11:02,660 --> 00:11:04,770
secretly releasing demons many times

170
00:11:04,770 --> 00:11:06,980
from under the nose of Chongwu Camp.

171
00:11:07,390 --> 00:11:08,460
You always say

172
00:11:08,460 --> 00:11:10,090
people can be good or bad,

173
00:11:10,310 --> 00:11:12,230

You don't need to tell me.

It seems your master didn't tell you that.

What do you want the Baize Token for?

228
00:14:29,380 --> 00:14:31,510
Because the goddess hasn't returned.

00:21:09,780 --> 00:21:11,040
to take care of me.

347
00:21:41,030 --> 00:21:42,300
If it's him,

348
00:21:42,980 --> 00:21:45,130
he might really know the whereabouts of the Baize Token.

349
00:21:45,130 --> 00:21:46,170
Impossible.

350
00:21:46,430 --> 00:21:49,750
Zhu Yan killed so many people from the Demon Hunting Bureau back then.

351
00:21:49,750 --> 00:21:51,610
Your master is the Baize Goddess.

352
00:21:52,780 --> 00:21:55,580
How could she possibly be old friends with Zhu Yan?

353
00:21:57,670 --> 00:21:58,830
You're so young.

354
00:21:59,190 --> 00:22:01,920
Don't always have such a precocious expression.

355
00:22:01,950 --> 00:22:03,670
I'll be 24 next month.

356
00:22:03,670 --> 00:22:05,810
Even if you were 42, I'd still be your aunt.

357
00:22:05,810 --> 00:22:06,470
I...

358
00:22:21,880 --> 00:22:23,130
I know.

359
00:22:24,440 --> 00:22:26,900
You can't get over that hurdle in your heart.

360
00:22:27,670 --> 00:22:30,260
He's the one who killed your father and brother,

361
00:22:30,260 --> 00:22:32,490
yet you have to fight alongside him

362
00:22:32,830 --> 00:22:34,630
and interact with him every day.

363
00:22:34,990 --> 00:22:37,580
I'm letting down the spirits of my father and brother.

364
00:22:37,580 --> 00:22:39,840
But to protect the Demon Hunting Bureau,

365
00:22:40,520 --> 00:22:42,600
you still agreed, didn't you?

366
00:22:43,850 --> 00:22:45,730
This is your ancestral home,

367
00:22:46,380 --> 00:22:48,320
the home you grew up in.

368
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:50,670
You were willing to donate it

369
00:22:50,670 --> 00:22:52,490
to rebuild the Demon Hunting Bureau.

370
00:22:52,490 --> 00:22:53,470
Can't you just...

371
00:22:53,470 --> 00:22:55,330
After my father and brother died,

372
00:22:55,790 --> 00:22:58,520
this place became just an empty, desolate house.

373
00:23:01,710 --> 00:23:02,800
Not a home.

374
00:23:03,910 --> 00:23:06,380
I lived here alone in a daze,

375
00:23:07,150 --> 00:23:08,370
wasting my time.

376
00:23:11,780 --> 00:23:12,900
Eight years ago,

377
00:23:14,100 --> 00:23:15,640
I already lost my home.

378
00:23:19,900 --> 00:23:22,480
Now that the people from the Demon Hunting Bureau are here,

379
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:23,890
there's more life here.

380
00:23:24,430 --> 00:23:26,360
It's actually better than before.

381
00:23:28,070 --> 00:23:29,310
For generations, the Zhuo family

382
00:23:29,310 --> 00:23:32,070
has been full of people with a sense of righteousness.

383
00:23:32,070 --> 00:23:33,230
Temporarily working with your enemy

384
00:23:33,230 --> 00:23:34,630
for the sake of investigating the case,

385
00:23:34,630 --> 00:23:36,480
for the Baize Token,

386
00:23:36,790 --> 00:23:38,650
they will surely understand you.

387
00:23:39,390 --> 00:23:40,590
They won't blame you.

388
00:23:42,950 --> 00:23:44,270
Actually, I agreed to him

389
00:23:44,270 --> 00:23:46,730
joining the Demon Hunting Squad because...

390
00:23:49,030 --> 00:23:49,750
What?

391
00:23:55,270 --> 00:23:56,110
Mr. Fan.

392
00:23:56,590 --> 00:23:57,430
Zhuo,

393
00:23:58,020 --> 00:24:00,090
do you know that your ancestor, Bingyi,

394
00:24:00,090 --> 00:24:02,370
once destroyed the evil demon Yinglong?

395
00:24:02,630 --> 00:24:03,420
Yes, I know.

396
00:24:03,560 --> 00:24:06,190
Yinglong had the divine power to glimpse the future.

397
00:24:06,190 --> 00:24:07,390
He once predicted

398
00:24:07,480 --> 00:24:10,270
that every successor of Bingyi who inherited the Cloud Light Sword

399
00:24:10,270 --> 00:24:12,940
would slay the evilest demon of their time.

400
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:14,720
Yinglong's prophecy

401
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:16,070
seems to be wrong.

402
00:24:17,510 --> 00:24:18,590
I can't kill him.

403
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:19,690
No.

404
00:24:19,870 --> 00:24:22,470
Yinglong's prophecies have never been wrong.

405
00:24:22,830 --> 00:24:24,430
Because it's not a prophecy.

406
00:24:24,990 --> 00:24:26,190
It's a curse.

407
00:24:29,810 --> 00:24:30,910
Slaying Zhu Yan

408
00:24:30,910 --> 00:24:32,420
is my mission.

409
00:24:33,470 --> 00:24:35,400
If this is also considered a curse,

410
00:24:37,310 --> 00:24:38,910
then I couldn't ask for more.

411
00:24:44,810 --> 00:24:45,890
It's nothing.

412
00:24:47,750 --> 00:24:48,550
Oh, right.

413
00:24:48,950 --> 00:24:52,010
Why did you go to the dungeon alone to see Zhao Yuanzhou?

414
00:24:56,850 --> 00:24:58,710
You and Zhao Yuanzhou...

415
00:25:00,510 --> 00:25:01,970
There's something wrong.

416
00:25:03,520 --> 00:25:05,070
We have a secret.

417
00:25:05,190 --> 00:25:05,950
You

418
00:25:06,210 --> 00:25:08,070
are the one with something wrong.

419
00:25:30,300 --> 00:25:31,070
Hey.

420
00:25:31,990 --> 00:25:33,120
What a coincidence.

421
00:25:36,990 --> 00:25:38,320
You're indeed a monkey.

422
00:25:45,190 --> 00:25:48,040
Although your Demon Hunting Bureau looks poor,

423
00:25:49,470 --> 00:25:50,940
it's quite spacious.

424
00:25:51,050 --> 00:25:52,350
You can work in the front

425
00:25:52,350 --> 00:25:53,550
and live in the back.

How did he get released?

429
00:26:00,680 --> 00:26:02,740
Wasn't a Demon Hunting Squad formed?

430
00:26:04,330 --> 00:26:06,260
I was afraid you'd leave me behind,

431
00:26:06,600 --> 00:26:07,930
so I followed you.

432
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:09,940
You actually followed me?

433
00:26:10,630 --> 00:26:11,810
Shameless.

434
00:26:12,190 --> 00:26:14,320
Isn't Mr. Zhuo eager to solve the case?

435
00:26:14,670 --> 00:26:16,330
I'm helping everyone save time.

We're still missing two.

As it happens, they are

440
00:26:24,830 --> 00:26:27,560
the two types of people I'm worst at dealing with.

441
00:26:28,410 --> 00:26:29,340
Which two types?

442
00:26:31,020 --> 00:26:31,990
One is a woman.

443
00:26:32,890 --> 00:26:34,130
The other is a child.

He probably can't even reach my knee, right?

Is he capable?

You were ordered to eliminate the demon.

That's right.

518
00:31:29,420 --> 00:31:32,150
That's why I resigned from my official position.

519
00:31:32,710 --> 00:31:35,970
It was to avoid getting involved in demonic affairs again.

520
00:31:38,100 --> 00:31:40,680
Don't you want to clear up your confusion?

521
00:31:42,500 --> 00:31:43,950
I've investigated

522
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:46,440
but found nothing.

523
00:31:48,290 --> 00:31:49,320
We all

524
00:31:50,830 --> 00:31:52,170
can help you.

525
00:31:56,030 --> 00:31:57,240
You all?

526
00:32:07,140 --> 00:32:07,930
Break.

527
00:32:42,640 --> 00:32:43,350
Us.

528
00:32:44,710 --> 00:32:45,870
But mainly me.

529
00:32:48,230 --> 00:32:48,830
She

530
00:32:49,970 --> 00:32:51,190
can't be relied upon.

531
00:32:53,580 --> 00:32:55,180
If I couldn't find anything,

532
00:32:55,980 --> 00:32:57,580
what makes you think you can?

533
00:33:06,110 --> 00:33:07,670
Isn't it obvious enough?

534
00:33:08,690 --> 00:33:10,110
I'm a demon.

535
00:33:10,710 --> 00:33:12,440
Things that humans don't know,

536
00:33:13,910 --> 00:33:15,100
I know.

537
00:33:16,390 --> 00:33:18,050
About your brother's matter,

538
00:33:18,830 --> 00:33:20,140
I know that too.

[Demon Hunting Bureau]

540
00:33:31,550 --> 00:33:32,750
Since we're here...

541
00:33:33,410 --> 00:33:35,490
[Demon Hunting Bureau]

542
00:33:36,830 --> 00:33:38,390
It's the Spring Festival.

543
00:33:53,570 --> 00:33:58,330
[Demon Hunting Bureau]

544
00:34:08,680 --> 00:34:09,670
Open.

545
00:34:22,170 --> 00:34:24,170
So this is the Demon Hunting Bureau?

546
00:34:33,060 --> 00:34:34,710
I wonder if I'll see him

547
00:34:35,310 --> 00:34:36,800
after I go in.

548
00:34:37,070 --> 00:34:37,920
Kid,

549
00:34:38,030 --> 00:34:39,639
who do you want to see?

550
00:34:41,060 --> 00:34:42,300
Why is it you again?

551
00:34:42,790 --> 00:34:43,630
How come

552
00:34:43,630 --> 00:34:45,560
you walk without making any sound?

553
00:34:46,070 --> 00:34:47,520
Stop dawdling.

554
00:34:47,710 --> 00:34:48,770
Just go in already.

555
00:34:49,500 --> 00:34:50,760
You don't understand.

556
00:34:52,710 --> 00:34:53,980
Haven't you heard?

557
00:34:54,400 --> 00:34:55,989
Inside the Demon Hunting Bureau, there's

558
00:34:55,989 --> 00:34:57,520
a thousand-year-old demon

559
00:34:57,590 --> 00:34:58,710
with a green face and fangs.

560
00:34:58,710 --> 00:34:59,860
It's ugly,

561
00:34:59,860 --> 00:35:00,980
and it even eats people.

562
00:35:00,980 --> 00:35:01,889
Nonsense!

563
00:35:03,750 --> 00:35:05,409
How could it possibly be ugly?

564
00:35:05,429 --> 00:35:06,520
It's true!

565
00:35:06,750 --> 00:35:08,550
I saw it with my own eyes.

566
00:35:08,980 --> 00:35:09,500
At that time,

567
00:35:09,500 --> 00:35:12,270
many experts from the Demon Hunting Bureau fell to the ground,

568
00:35:12,270 --> 00:35:13,639
leaving only me.

569
00:35:13,820 --> 00:35:15,170
I was terrified then,

570
00:35:15,199 --> 00:35:16,679
but I still bravely went up

571
00:35:16,710 --> 00:35:18,840
and fought fiercely with that Zhu Yan.

572
00:35:19,070 --> 00:35:20,400
In the end, I can only say

573
00:35:20,750 --> 00:35:22,080
it was a narrow victory.

574
00:35:23,030 --> 00:35:24,909
Otherwise, why do you think the Demon Hunting Bureau would choose me

575
00:35:24,909 --> 00:35:27,110
to join the first elite squad?

576
00:35:27,750 --> 00:35:28,710
Bai Jiu.

577
00:35:29,870 --> 00:35:30,780
Hello.

578
00:35:37,550 --> 00:35:38,740
Don't look down on me because of my short stature.

579
00:35:38,740 --> 00:35:40,670
That's because I'm only 13 years old.

580
00:35:40,670 --> 00:35:42,790
Don't underestimate me because of my young age.

581
00:35:42,790 --> 00:35:43,790
I'm very capable.

582
00:35:45,590 --> 00:35:47,420
Since Commander Zhuo chose you,

583
00:35:47,670 --> 00:35:48,750
it means

584
00:35:48,840 --> 00:35:50,790
you must have some exceptional qualities.

585
00:35:50,790 --> 00:35:52,400
Mr. Zhuo chose me?

586
00:35:54,190 --> 00:35:56,030
The hero I admire chose me.

587
00:35:56,390 --> 00:35:56,990
Let's go.

588
00:35:57,220 --> 00:35:59,080
I'll take you to meet Mr. Zhuo.

589
00:36:00,990 --> 00:36:02,590
Thank you.

590
00:36:02,830 --> 00:36:04,390
You're so kind.

591
00:36:06,070 --> 00:36:07,630
What's wrong with you, Great Demon?

592
00:36:07,630 --> 00:36:08,690
Why are you so late?

593
00:36:09,430 --> 00:36:10,230
Great Demon?

594
00:36:11,070 --> 00:36:11,910
Where?

595
00:36:13,310 --> 00:36:13,870
Him.

596
00:36:14,390 --> 00:36:15,120
Great Demon.

597
00:36:15,470 --> 00:36:16,310
Zhu Yan.

598
00:36:17,030 --> 00:36:18,890
So you're the Great Demon Zhu Yan?

599
00:36:47,400 --> 00:36:48,470
Let me go.

600
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:52,100
Put me down!

601
00:37:01,390 --> 00:37:03,080
You don't need to be so afraid.

602
00:37:03,150 --> 00:37:04,270
Zhao Yuanzhou

603
00:37:04,270 --> 00:37:05,470
is just unserious.

604
00:37:05,470 --> 00:37:06,870
He likes to scare people.

605
00:37:07,390 --> 00:37:08,930
He doesn't eat children.

606
00:37:09,870 --> 00:37:11,030
Isn't he that

607
00:37:11,050 --> 00:37:12,690
extremely hungry demon?

608
00:37:12,790 --> 00:37:13,630
If he's so hungry,

609
00:37:13,630 --> 00:37:15,430
how can he resist eating people?

610
00:37:24,620 --> 00:37:26,570
He must be Mr. Zhuo Yichen.

611
00:37:26,770 --> 00:37:28,000
The thing in his hand

612
00:37:28,030 --> 00:37:29,190
is the legendary

613
00:37:29,190 --> 00:37:31,250
Cloud Light Sword of the Bingyi Clan.

614
00:37:35,620 --> 00:37:37,910
Aren't all demons afraid of this sword?

615
00:37:38,480 --> 00:37:40,610
Even Great Demons must fear it, right?

616
00:37:47,730 --> 00:37:48,530
Hello.

617
00:37:51,350 --> 00:37:52,070
Hello.

618
00:38:01,710 --> 00:38:02,310
Ms. Pei,

you're here.

620
00:38:03,830 --> 00:38:05,020
Let me introduce you.

621
00:38:05,020 --> 00:38:06,350
This is the new doctor,

622
00:38:06,370 --> 00:38:06,970
Bai Jiu.

623
00:38:10,030 --> 00:38:10,980
Hello, Sister.

624
00:38:11,050 --> 00:38:13,250
From now on, please take good care of me.

625

I don't believe the words of an

extremely evil demon.

641
00:38:59,530 --> 00:39:01,270
It's right not to believe him.

642
00:39:02,020 --> 00:39:04,140
People from the Demon Hunting Bureau,

00:39:04,140 --> 00:39:04,910

♫Heartlessness births a dream♫

649
00:39:34,470 --> 00:39:36,740
Mr. Zhuo, you're so imposing and powerful now.

650
00:39:36,740 --> 00:39:39,570
You must've forgotten the pain of the wood that has healed.

651
00:39:39,570 --> 00:39:42,790
Back then, the Demon Hunting Bureau was destroyed by Zhu Yan.

652
00:39:42,790 --> 00:39:44,660
It was the Chongwu Camp that took on the dangerous mission

653
00:39:44,660 --> 00:39:46,120
and protected the people.

654
00:39:47,290 --> 00:39:47,980
What?

655
00:39:48,930 --> 00:39:50,010
You forgot?

656
00:39:51,060 --> 00:39:53,660
The Chongwu Camp is ruthless and vicious

657
00:39:53,710 --> 00:39:54,950
in demon hunting.

658
00:39:54,970 --> 00:39:56,680
You even harm innocent lives.

659
00:39:56,710 --> 00:39:57,990
It goes against the law.

660
00:39:57,990 --> 00:40:01,170
The Chongwu Camp should have been stopped from acting arbitrarily long ago.

661
00:40:01,170 --> 00:40:02,960
Demons are inherently violent.

662
00:40:02,960 --> 00:40:04,310
To eliminate future troubles,

663
00:40:04,310 --> 00:40:06,870
it's better to kill a wrong one than to let one go.

664
00:40:06,870 --> 00:40:09,480
The Chongwu Camp privately built an underground black market,

665
00:40:09,480 --> 00:40:11,320
trading demon beast furs and bones,

666
00:40:11,320 --> 00:40:12,920
making exorbitant profits.

667
00:40:13,400 --> 00:40:15,200
And in the name of demon hunting,

668
00:40:15,750 --> 00:40:16,870
you forcibly recruit able-bodied men

669
00:40:16,870 --> 00:40:18,400
and occupy civilian homes.

670
00:40:18,570 --> 00:40:20,890
Does King Xiang know about all of this?

671
00:40:33,090 --> 00:40:34,470
Mr. Zhen Mei,

672
00:40:34,910 --> 00:40:36,150
we're in broad daylight

673
00:40:36,150 --> 00:40:37,560
and in full view of everyone.

674
00:40:37,560 --> 00:40:39,680
You're not planning to commit murder and arson, are you?

675
00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:42,430
The Demon Hunting Bureau has fallen into disrepair.

676
00:40:42,430 --> 00:40:43,870
The weather is hot and dry,

677
00:40:43,870 --> 00:40:45,360
which caused a wildfire.

678
00:40:46,150 --> 00:40:47,950
What does that have to do with me?

679
00:41:04,430 --> 00:41:06,060
Have you asked my permission

680
00:41:06,190 --> 00:41:08,790
before burning down the Demon Hunting Bureau?

681
00:41:09,450 --> 00:41:10,970
What do you think you are?

682
00:41:12,060 --> 00:41:12,900
A demon.

683
00:41:13,110 --> 00:41:13,860
A demon?

684
00:41:15,390 --> 00:41:17,250
Then you deserve to die even more.

685
00:41:20,720 --> 00:41:21,480
Reverse.

686
00:41:24,490 --> 00:41:25,730
I forgot to tell you,

687
00:41:26,550 --> 00:41:27,910
I'm the type of demon

688
00:41:27,910 --> 00:41:30,510
that likes to kill people to vent my anger.

689
00:41:32,780 --> 00:41:33,980
Zhao Yuanzhou,

690
00:41:34,100 --> 00:41:35,550
calm down.

691
00:41:36,940 --> 00:41:38,100
Mr. Fan.

692
00:41:40,420 --> 00:41:41,920
Spare them.

693
00:41:42,250 --> 00:41:43,230
General Wu,

694
00:41:43,830 --> 00:41:45,030
what brings you here?

695
00:41:45,800 --> 00:41:48,330
Mr. Fan said he prepared a gift for King Xiang.

696
00:41:48,450 --> 00:41:50,450
I came personally to receive it

697
00:41:50,520 --> 00:41:52,210
on behalf of King Xiang.

698
00:41:56,670 --> 00:41:58,050
Over the past eight years,

699
00:41:58,050 --> 00:42:00,320
close to 700 innocent people have been killed by the Chongwu Camp

700
00:42:00,320 --> 00:42:01,580
while hunting demons.

701
00:42:01,720 --> 00:42:04,430
The list and related evidence are all here.

702
00:42:05,010 --> 00:42:06,730
Please review them, General.

703
00:42:21,680 --> 00:42:23,320
I accept this

704
00:42:24,590 --> 00:42:26,520
grand gift on behalf of King Xiang.

705
00:42:26,960 --> 00:42:28,110
He now understands

706
00:42:28,110 --> 00:42:30,830
the Demon Hunting Bureau's determination to revitalize itself.

707
00:42:30,830 --> 00:42:32,880
He agrees for you to take over from the Chongwu Camp

708
00:42:32,880 --> 00:42:36,080
and thoroughly investigate the Water Ghost murder case.

709
00:42:36,430 --> 00:42:38,770
The Demon Hunting Bureau hereby requests permission from King Xiang

710
00:42:38,770 --> 00:42:40,370
to thoroughly investigate the Water Ghost murder case.

711
00:42:40,370 --> 00:42:41,980
Do not harm civilians.

712
00:42:42,010 --> 00:42:43,500
Do not be negligent or lazy.

713
00:42:43,500 --> 00:42:45,670
The Demon Hunting Bureau should spare no effort

714
00:42:45,670 --> 00:42:47,310
to solve this case.

715
00:42:47,470 --> 00:42:48,790
I'll trouble you all

716
00:42:48,790 --> 00:42:50,050
to sign and stamp this,

717
00:42:50,300 --> 00:42:51,730
so I can take it back

718
00:42:51,750 --> 00:42:53,410
and report back to King Xiang.

719
00:42:59,500 --> 00:43:02,850

720
00:43:09,650 --> 00:43:10,460
Sir,

721
00:43:10,810 --> 00:43:13,140
you can press down at the end of the scroll.

722
00:43:30,350 --> 00:43:31,630
Mr. Zhuo,

723
00:43:31,650 --> 00:43:33,650
there are people behind you, right?

724
00:43:41,860 --> 00:43:43,260
There's one more person.

725
00:43:45,940 --> 00:43:47,210
She won't need to.

726
00:43:47,420 --> 00:43:49,200
I just heard her say

727
00:43:49,330 --> 00:43:51,860
she refuses to join the Demon Hunting Bureau.

728
00:43:52,170 --> 00:43:54,570
The Demon Hunting Bureau is truly useless.

729
00:43:54,770 --> 00:43:57,050
Even the dogs that our Chongwu Camp doesn't want

730
00:43:57,050 --> 00:43:59,180
look down on the Demon Hunting Bureau.

731
00:44:19,020 --> 00:44:20,200
[Military Order]

732
00:44:21,680 --> 00:44:23,880
Did you hear any dogs barking?

733
00:44:24,790 --> 00:44:25,870
It's a bit noisy.

734
00:44:36,140 --> 00:44:37,400
They're finally gone.

735
00:44:37,950 --> 00:44:39,140
Indeed.

736
00:44:40,770 --> 00:44:43,540
It's a pity the evidence of Chongwu Camp's crimes was burned.

737
00:44:43,540 --> 00:44:44,810
The real evidence

738
00:44:45,070 --> 00:44:46,410
was secretly sent

739
00:44:46,580 --> 00:44:48,640
to the Prime Minister the day before.

740
00:44:48,800 --> 00:44:50,790
If one day they really need to be held accountable,

741
00:44:50,790 --> 00:44:53,190
the Prime Minister will make the decision.

742
00:44:53,500 --> 00:44:54,680
The chance to investigate

743
00:44:54,680 --> 00:44:56,810
the Water Ghost case didn't come easy.

744
00:44:57,400 --> 00:44:59,160
Whether the Demon Hunting Bureau can be revitalized

745
00:44:59,160 --> 00:45:00,960
depends on this crucial battle.

746
00:45:02,720 --> 00:45:03,610
Zhao Yuanzhou,

747
00:45:03,640 --> 00:45:05,500
you'd better not play any tricks.

748
00:45:05,710 --> 00:45:06,700
Mr. Zhuo,

749
00:45:07,680 --> 00:45:08,760
trust me.

750
00:45:09,350 --> 00:45:10,550
Dream on.

751
00:45:43,110 --> 00:45:45,710
These are all the files on the Water Ghost case.

752
00:45:46,230 --> 00:45:48,230
Everyone, please take a look first.

761
00:46:33,630 --> 00:46:34,670
This is blood.

762
00:46:35,890 --> 00:46:37,220
The blood of the demon Meng Ji.
