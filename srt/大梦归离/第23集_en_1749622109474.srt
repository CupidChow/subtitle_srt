Episode 19

35
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:56,840
What are you guys doing? What's going on?

36
00:01:56,840 --> 00:01:59,840
It's possible that Lillun is dead.

37
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:06,840
Did you see Lillun's list when Lillun died?

38
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:10,840
No. We thought that his list was confiscated by the non-combat.

39
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:14,840
That's right. Lillun has the ability to sacrifice herself.

40
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:19,840
Before she died, she must have put her list in the body of someone.

41
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:22,840
Since then, she has been burned by the non-combat.

42
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:24,840
She has already been sacrificed by that person.

43
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:29,840
You are not dead or dead.

44
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:36,840
You will always kill her.

45
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:40,840
Kill Zhao Yanzhou.

46
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:46,840
It's Zhao Yanzhou.

47
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:51,840
It was Zhao Yanzhou who sacrificed himself at that time.

48
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:46,840
I'm now a master of the mortals.

49
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:49,840
It's you.

50
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:50,840
Go.

51
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:52,840
I will kill Zhao Yanzhou.

52
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:53,840
Go.

53
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:17,840
I will kill Zhao Yanzhou.

54
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:41,840
I brought wine here.

55
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:47,840
But it seems that you can't drink it anymore.

56
00:04:50,840 --> 00:04:53,840
I once made a vow.

57
00:04:56,840 --> 00:04:59,840
I must personally understand your grudges.

58
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:01,840
All the way here,

59
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:06,840
I felt that

60
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:10,840
I was too weak to say it.

61
00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:17,840
I felt that I was too weak to say it.

62
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:24,840
But

63
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:29,840
this day is finally here.

64
00:05:32,840 --> 00:05:34,840
It's like a book.

65
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:38,840
It's a book that has been written.

66
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:45,840
No matter how many times I look back,

67
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:53,840
the ending

68
00:05:57,840 --> 00:05:59,840
is the same.

69
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:07,840
I will kill Zhao Yanzhou.

70
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:11,840
I will kill Zhao Yanzhou.

71
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:14,840
I will kill Zhao Yanzhou.

72
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:17,840
I will kill Zhao Yanzhou.

73
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:20,840
I will kill Zhao Yanzhou.

74
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:23,840
I will kill Zhao Yanzhou.

75
00:06:24,840 --> 00:06:26,840
I will kill Zhao Yanzhou.

76
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:29,840
I will kill Zhao Yanzhou.

77
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:32,840
I will kill Zhao Yanzhou.

78
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:37,840
I will kill Zhao Yanzhou.

79
00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:40,840
I will kill Zhao Yanzhou.

80
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:43,840
I will kill Zhao Yanzhou.

81
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:46,840
I will kill Zhao Yanzhou.

82
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:49,840
I will kill Zhao Yanzhou.

83
00:06:50,840 --> 00:06:52,840
I will kill Zhao Yanzhou.

84
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:55,840
I will kill Zhao Yanzhou.

85
00:06:56,840 --> 00:06:58,840
I will kill Zhao Yanzhou.

86
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:01,840
I will kill Zhao Yanzhou.

87
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:03,840
I will kill Zhao Yanzhou.

88
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:05,840
I will kill Zhao Yanzhou.

89
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:31,840
Are you okay?

90
00:07:34,840 --> 00:07:36,840
The theory is over.

91
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:38,840
Let's go.

92
00:07:38,840 --> 00:07:39,840
Wait.

93
00:07:40,840 --> 00:07:42,840
Let's fix the white jade.

94
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:45,840
Otherwise, we will be in danger.

95
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:47,840
We can't change Zhao Yanzhou.

96
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:48,840
Right.

97
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:49,840
The key.

98
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:04,840
The key.

99
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:27,840
I will kill Zhao Yanzhou.

100
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:31,840
The key.

101
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:32,840
The key.

102
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:35,840
I'm not afraid of you.

Get down!

149
00:10:57,840 --> 00:10:59,840
Get down!

150
00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:09,840
Yi Qi Chang, you're still the same.

151
00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:11,840
You always know how to break people.

152
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:23,840
That's fake.

153
00:11:27,840 --> 00:11:29,840
So many odds now.

154
00:11:29,840 --> 00:11:33,200
Master Lesh, you can fight back and avoid me.

155
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:34,840
Get me out!

156
00:11:34,840 --> 00:11:38,700
Do you think Yi Bai Biao Chow Dong will win?

157
00:11:39,100 --> 00:11:41,100
I'll prove it to everyone.

158
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:43,100
Don't leave me behind.

159
00:11:43,100 --> 00:11:48,700
Do you think Yi Bai Biao Chow Dong will win?

160
00:11:48,700 --> 00:11:50,700
Don't be mad.

161
00:11:50,700 --> 00:11:52,700
Get in the house, everyone.

162
00:11:52,700 --> 00:11:54,700
Don't run around freely.

163
00:11:54,700 --> 00:11:56,700
Everyone's quiet.

164
00:11:56,700 --> 00:11:58,700
I'm not sure if I can get through this.

165
00:11:58,700 --> 00:12:00,700
I'm not sure if I can get through this.

166

00:12:38,700 --> 00:12:40,700
I'm not sure if I can get through this.

186
00:12:40,700 --> 00:12:42,700
I'm not sure if I can get through this.

187
00:12:42,700 --> 00:12:44,700
I'm not sure if I can get through this.

188
00:12:44,700 --> 00:12:46,700
I'm not sure if I can get through this.

189
00:12:46,700 --> 00:12:48,700
I'm not sure if I can get through this.

190
00:12:48,700 --> 00:12:50,700
I'm not sure if I can get through this.

191
00:12:50,700 --> 00:12:52,700
I'm not sure if I can get through this.

192
00:12:52,700 --> 00:12:54,700
I'm not sure if I can get through this.

193
00:12:54,700 --> 00:12:56,700
I'm not sure if I can get through this.

194
00:12:56,700 --> 00:12:58,700
I'm not sure if I can get through this.

195
00:12:58,700 --> 00:13:00,700
It happens that way.

196
00:13:00,700 --> 00:13:02,700
I'm not sure if I can get through it.

197
00:13:02,700 --> 00:13:04,700
I'm not sure.

198
00:13:04,700 --> 00:13:06,700
it happens that way.

199
00:13:06,700 --> 00:13:08,700
I'm not sure if I can get through this.

200
00:13:08,700 --> 00:13:10,700
Sure, okay?

201
00:13:10,700 --> 00:13:12,700
Fine.

202
00:13:12,700 --> 00:13:14,700
Alright, let's go.

203
00:13:14,700 --> 00:13:16,700
Okay.

204
00:13:16,700 --> 00:13:18,700
I'm going to get through this.

205
00:13:18,700 --> 00:13:22,660
The

206
00:13:38,180 --> 00:13:40,980
open God

207
00:13:44,460 --> 00:13:44,880
Xia medic blood

208
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:46,880
Little Master, save me!

209
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:48,880
Brother! Little Master!

210
00:13:53,880 --> 00:13:54,880
You...

211
00:13:56,880 --> 00:13:58,880
You're not Bai Jianghou.

212
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:00,880
Bai is Li Lun.

213
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:03,880
It's time.

214
00:14:05,880 --> 00:14:08,880
Until now, you've only seen it.

215
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:11,880
Damn it.

216
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:14,880
I'm fooled by you.

217
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:15,880
When will you use your hands?

218
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:20,880
I've already put the internal pill in Bai's body.

219
00:14:21,880 --> 00:14:23,880
I'm going to use it with my master.

220
00:14:35,880 --> 00:14:37,880
I underestimated you.

221
00:14:37,880 --> 00:14:44,880
But this is a very good gift.

222
00:14:47,880 --> 00:14:49,880
I just got my body.

223
00:14:49,880 --> 00:14:50,880
I'm not weak yet.

224
00:14:51,880 --> 00:14:53,880
I can't take care of the body at all.

225
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:55,880
So,

226
00:14:56,880 --> 00:15:00,880
I can only wait for her to enter the dream at night.

227
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:03,880
Then I can make a move.

228
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:10,880
Even if that's the case,

229
00:15:11,880 --> 00:15:12,880
it's not enough.

230
00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:15,880
You're like a little boy.

231
00:15:15,880 --> 00:15:17,880
But you're like a little boy.

232
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:22,880
I want to see if she has time to find you

233
00:15:23,880 --> 00:15:25,880
under the circumstances of the whole Chen Tongji.

234
00:15:27,880 --> 00:15:28,880
Yes.

235
00:15:29,880 --> 00:15:30,880
So,

236
00:15:31,880 --> 00:15:33,880
Ao Yin deliberately shot Xiao Zheng just now

237
00:15:33,880 --> 00:15:35,880
to let you out of the control area.

238
00:15:35,880 --> 00:15:36,880
That's right.

239
00:15:37,880 --> 00:15:38,880
Otherwise,

240
00:15:39,880 --> 00:15:40,880
how can I stop you?

241
00:15:41,880 --> 00:15:42,880
You lied to Master Xiao Zhuo.

242
00:15:43,880 --> 00:15:44,880
You used his sword to kill people.

243
00:15:45,880 --> 00:15:46,880
What are you doing to me?

244
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:48,880
Master Xiao Zhuo,

245
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:49,880
I've been doing this for a long time.

246
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:52,880
The Soul-Demolishing String that I finally made

247
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:56,880
is a kind of fake medicine made of dead body and grass.

248
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:02,880
Why did you suddenly come out of the house?

249
00:16:03,880 --> 00:16:04,880
I'm also curious.

250
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:09,880
I just hope

251
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:12,880
that I can stay in the grass and hurt you.

252
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:15,880
You don't have to suffer.

253
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:17,880
The one who did it is not you.

254
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:19,880
It's Li Lun.

255
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:26,880
What is the Soul-Demolishing String?

256
00:16:27,880 --> 00:16:29,880
I've been doing this for half of my life.

257
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:31,880
I've been listening to the truth.

258
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:33,880
I've been doing this for half of my life.

259
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:35,880
I've been listening to the truth.

260
00:16:37,880 --> 00:16:38,880
Don't worry.

261
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:41,880
This time,

262
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:44,880
Zhao Yanzhou is still in my hands.

263
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:49,880
As long as I can take care of Zhao Yanzhou's heart,

264
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:52,880
he can do anything for me.

265
00:16:53,880 --> 00:16:55,880
He will never remember who he is.

266
00:16:57,880 --> 00:16:58,880
Naturally,

267
00:16:59,880 --> 00:17:01,880
he will forget you.

268
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:03,880
From now on,

269
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:05,880
he will only listen to you.

270
00:17:07,880 --> 00:17:09,880
But he has a strong will.

271
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:11,880
He is no longer his curse.

272
00:17:13,880 --> 00:17:15,880
He is the phoenix of the world.

273
00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:31,880
The phoenix of the world.

274
00:17:51,880 --> 00:17:52,880
You can't bear to let go anymore?

275
00:17:55,880 --> 00:17:56,880
That's right.

276
00:17:57,880 --> 00:17:59,880
If I see it more, I won't die.

277
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:02,880
But Baijiu will die.

278
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:31,880
The End

279
00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:35,880
The End

280
00:18:43,880 --> 00:18:45,880
I raised this snake moth myself.

281
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:48,880
It was trapped in the 300 years of Japanese.

282
00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:51,880
I'm going to play this song every day.

283
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:54,880
It will naturally be with me.

284
00:18:57,880 --> 00:18:58,880
Master Shen,

285
00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:01,880
this time, Zhao Yanzhou will be with us.

286
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:28,880
The End

287
00:19:56,880 --> 00:19:58,880
The End

288
00:20:17,880 --> 00:20:18,880
Zhao Yanzhou,

289
00:20:19,880 --> 00:20:21,880
I don't want to kill you with the Cloud Sword.

290
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:24,880
So, I must do it.

291
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:28,880
The End

292
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:39,880
This time,

293
00:20:41,880 --> 00:20:43,880
it's for your own good.

294
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:58,880
The End

295
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:28,880
The End

296
00:21:56,880 --> 00:21:58,880
The End

297
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:11,880
Stop, Xiao Zhu.

298
00:22:11,880 --> 00:22:12,880
The Cloud Sword is fake.

299
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:19,880
Xiao Zhu.

300
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:25,880
Xiao Zhu.

301
00:22:25,880 --> 00:22:26,880
What are you doing?

302
00:22:27,880 --> 00:22:29,880
Baijiu is under the control of the Cloud Sword.

303
00:22:29,880 --> 00:22:30,880
Go out and help them.

304
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:31,880
Leave the demon to me.

305
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:33,880
No.

306
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:36,880
This is the most dangerous.

307
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:47,880
Don't worry.

308
00:22:51,880 --> 00:22:52,880
Be careful.

309
00:22:55,880 --> 00:22:56,880
The End

310
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:21,880
The End

311
00:23:25,880 --> 00:23:26,880
The End

312
00:23:35,880 --> 00:23:36,880
The End

313
00:23:55,880 --> 00:23:56,880
The End

314
00:24:07,880 --> 00:24:08,880
Where is Zhao Yanzhou?

315
00:24:09,880 --> 00:24:11,880
He has been in the sea for a thousand years.

316
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:13,880
Don't worry.

317
00:24:13,880 --> 00:24:14,880
He is fine.

318
00:24:25,880 --> 00:24:26,880
The End

319
00:24:55,880 --> 00:24:56,880
The End

320
00:25:25,880 --> 00:25:27,880
The End

321
00:25:55,880 --> 00:25:56,880
The End

322
00:26:25,880 --> 00:26:26,880
The End

323
00:26:55,880 --> 00:26:56,880
The End

324
00:27:21,880 --> 00:27:22,880
If you are real,

325
00:27:25,880 --> 00:27:26,880
it's good.

326
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:35,880
But,

327
00:27:41,880 --> 00:27:43,880
this is my little Xia.

328
00:27:56,880 --> 00:27:57,880
Do you think

329
00:27:59,880 --> 00:28:00,880
I will do the same to you?

330
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:03,880
No.

331
00:28:03,880 --> 00:28:04,880
But it won't hurt that much.

332
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:27,880
So,

333
00:28:31,880 --> 00:28:33,880
I am not doing it?

334
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:37,880
What do you think?

335
00:28:49,880 --> 00:28:50,880
Bai Ze Li.

336
00:28:51,880 --> 00:28:52,880
I am done.

337
00:28:53,880 --> 00:28:54,880
It's done.

338
00:29:01,880 --> 00:29:02,880
You seem

339
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:06,880
different from before.

340
00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:13,880
It's been so long.

341
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:17,880
It will be different.

342
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:23,880
Is it?

343
00:29:52,880 --> 00:29:53,880
The End

344
00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:23,880
The End

345
00:30:52,880 --> 00:30:53,880
The End

346
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:23,880
The End

347
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:39,880
It's been a long time.

348
00:31:41,880 --> 00:31:42,880
How can I help you?

349
00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:49,880
You said it's true.

350
00:31:53,880 --> 00:31:54,880
It's been a long time.

351
00:31:56,880 --> 00:31:57,880
It's been a long time.

352
00:31:59,880 --> 00:32:00,880
It's been a long time.

353
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:23,880
The End

354
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:33,880
Little girl.

355
00:32:33,880 --> 00:32:34,880
Little girl.

356
00:32:35,880 --> 00:32:36,880
Little girl.

357
00:32:37,880 --> 00:32:38,880
Little girl.

358
00:32:39,880 --> 00:32:40,880
Little Chou.

359
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:41,880
Is it you?

360
00:32:41,880 --> 00:32:42,880
Little Chou.

361
00:32:43,880 --> 00:32:44,880
Chao Si.

362
00:32:47,880 --> 00:32:48,880
Look.

363
00:32:49,880 --> 00:32:51,880
I am not your little girl.

364
00:32:52,880 --> 00:32:53,880
I am Li Lun.

365
00:32:55,880 --> 00:32:57,880
I want you to know the truth.

366
00:32:58,880 --> 00:32:59,880
Look carefully.

367
00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:02,880
Who killed you?

368
00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:24,880
The End

369
00:33:52,880 --> 00:33:53,880
The End

370
00:34:09,880 --> 00:34:11,880
I hated this palace so much.

371
00:34:13,880 --> 00:34:14,880
I didn't expect

372
00:34:14,880 --> 00:34:15,880
one day

373
00:34:15,880 --> 00:34:16,880
I would take back

374
00:34:16,880 --> 00:34:18,880
it and kill it.

375
00:34:23,880 --> 00:34:24,880
The End

376
00:34:33,880 --> 00:34:34,880
Thank you, father.

377
00:34:52,880 --> 00:34:53,880
The End

378
00:35:11,880 --> 00:35:12,880
Little girl.

379
00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:23,880
Little girl.

380
00:35:23,880 --> 00:35:24,880
Little girl.

381
00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:25,880
Little girl.

382
00:35:53,880 --> 00:35:55,880
I will kill you, little girl.

383
00:36:19,880 --> 00:36:20,880
Little girl.

384
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:23,880
Little girl.

385
00:36:23,880 --> 00:36:24,880
Little girl.

386
00:36:24,880 --> 00:36:25,880
Little girl.

387
00:36:25,880 --> 00:36:26,880
Little girl.

388
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:27,880
Little girl.

389
00:36:27,880 --> 00:36:28,880
Little girl.

390
00:36:28,880 --> 00:36:29,880
Little girl.

391
00:36:29,880 --> 00:36:30,880
Little girl.

392
00:36:30,880 --> 00:36:31,880
Little girl.

393
00:36:31,880 --> 00:36:32,880
Little girl.

394
00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:33,880
Little girl.

395
00:36:33,880 --> 00:36:34,880
Little girl.

396
00:36:34,880 --> 00:36:35,880
Little girl.

397
00:36:35,880 --> 00:36:36,880
Little girl.

398
00:36:36,880 --> 00:36:37,880
Little girl.

399
00:36:37,880 --> 00:36:38,880
Little girl.

400
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:39,880
Little girl.

401
00:36:39,880 --> 00:36:40,880
Little girl.

402
00:36:40,880 --> 00:36:41,880
Little girl.

403
00:36:41,880 --> 00:36:42,880
Little girl.

404
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:43,880
Little girl.

405
00:36:43,880 --> 00:36:44,880
Little girl.

406
00:36:44,880 --> 00:36:45,880
Little girl.

407
00:36:45,880 --> 00:36:46,880
Little girl.

408
00:36:46,880 --> 00:36:47,880
Little girl.

409
00:36:47,880 --> 00:36:48,880
Little girl.

410
00:36:48,880 --> 00:36:49,880
Little girl.

411
00:36:49,880 --> 00:36:50,880
Little girl.

412
00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:51,880
Little girl.

413
00:36:51,880 --> 00:36:52,880
Little girl.

414
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:53,880
Little girl.

415
00:36:53,880 --> 00:36:54,880
Little girl.

416
00:36:54,880 --> 00:36:55,880
Little girl.

417
00:36:55,880 --> 00:36:56,880
Little girl.

418
00:36:56,880 --> 00:36:57,880
Little girl.

419
00:36:57,880 --> 00:36:58,880
Little girl.

420
00:36:58,880 --> 00:36:59,880
Little girl.

421
00:36:59,880 --> 00:37:00,880
Little girl.

422
00:37:00,880 --> 00:37:01,880
Little girl.

423
00:37:01,880 --> 00:37:03,880
Little girl.

424
00:37:04,880 --> 00:37:05,880
Little girl.

425
00:37:05,880 --> 00:37:06,960
Little girl.

426
00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:08,880
Little girl.

427
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:09,880
Little girl.

428
00:37:09,880 --> 00:37:10,880
Little girl.

429
00:37:10,880 --> 00:37:11,880
Little girl.

430
00:37:11,880 --> 00:37:12,880
Little girl.

431
00:37:12,880 --> 00:37:13,880
Little girl.

432
00:37:13,880 --> 00:37:14,880
Did you know

433
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:16,880
that Dragon King

434
00:37:16,880 --> 00:37:17,880
attacked the Seven Kingdom Hades?

435
00:37:17,880 --> 00:37:18,880
다른生 stood behind

436
00:37:18,880 --> 00:37:19,880
squared soldiers

437
00:37:19,880 --> 00:37:21,780
and attacked the Seven Kingdom Hades

438
00:37:21,780 --> 00:37:24,780
After the last few hours of the dust,

439
00:37:25,780 --> 00:37:30,780
his body will never be able to come out again.

440
00:37:51,780 --> 00:37:54,780
The last few hours of the dust,

441
00:37:55,780 --> 00:37:59,780
his body will never be able to come out again.

442
00:38:00,780 --> 00:38:03,780
After the last few hours of the dust,

443
00:38:04,780 --> 00:38:08,780
his body will never be able to come out again.

444
00:38:09,780 --> 00:38:12,780
After the last few hours of the dust,

445
00:38:13,780 --> 00:38:17,780
his body will never be able to come out again.

446
00:38:18,780 --> 00:38:21,780
After the last few hours of the dust,

447
00:38:22,780 --> 00:38:26,780
his body will never be able to come out again.

448
00:38:28,780 --> 00:38:32,780
After the last few hours of the dust,

449
00:38:33,780 --> 00:38:37,780
his body will never be able to come out again.

450
00:38:38,780 --> 00:38:42,780
The last few hours of the dust,

451
00:38:42,780 --> 00:38:44,780
I feel very safe.

452
00:38:52,780 --> 00:38:53,780
Are you afraid of me?

453
00:38:54,780 --> 00:38:55,780
Lord Xiao Zhu is here.

454
00:38:56,780 --> 00:38:57,780
And Yun Guangjian, who is your best friend.

455
00:38:58,780 --> 00:38:59,780
I'm not that afraid.

456
00:39:13,780 --> 00:39:14,780
I'm sorry.

457
00:39:17,780 --> 00:39:18,780
It's definitely not a problem.

458
00:39:42,780 --> 00:39:43,780
Lord Xiao Zhu.

459
00:40:05,780 --> 00:40:06,780
Lord Xiao Zhu.

460
00:40:07,780 --> 00:40:08,780
You can't eat the body.

461
00:40:09,780 --> 00:40:10,780
My little brother is bleeding.

462
00:40:10,780 --> 00:40:11,780
I can't eat the body.

463
00:40:12,780 --> 00:40:13,780
My little brother is bleeding.

464
00:40:34,780 --> 00:40:35,780
Give me back the ball.

465
00:40:40,780 --> 00:40:41,780
I'm sorry.

466
00:41:10,780 --> 00:41:11,780
Lord Xiao Zhu.

467
00:41:40,780 --> 00:41:41,780
Lord Xiao Zhu.

468
00:42:11,780 --> 00:42:12,780
Lord Xiao Zhu.

469
00:42:15,780 --> 00:42:16,780
Yu Lun.

470
00:42:27,780 --> 00:42:28,780
Lord Xiao Zhu.

471
00:42:36,780 --> 00:42:37,780
You're really hard.

472
00:42:38,780 --> 00:42:40,780
I let you get away with it.

473
00:42:41,780 --> 00:42:43,780
How could I die in front of you?

474
00:42:43,780 --> 00:42:44,780
Lord Xiao Zhu, wake up.

475
00:42:45,780 --> 00:42:47,780
I won't talk to you again.

476
00:42:47,780 --> 00:42:48,780
Okay?

477
00:42:48,780 --> 00:42:49,780
Lord Xiao Zhu.

478
00:42:49,780 --> 00:42:50,780
Zhao Yanzhou.

479
00:42:51,780 --> 00:42:53,780
I'm really grateful to you.

480
00:42:55,780 --> 00:42:58,780
If you hadn't died in front of me,

481
00:42:58,780 --> 00:43:00,780
how could I have been so perfect.

482
00:43:01,780 --> 00:43:03,780
So much for the body of a ghost.

483
00:43:03,780 --> 00:43:07,780
You finally did something that made me happy.

484
00:43:09,780 --> 00:43:11,780
You and Wen Zongyu did it

485
00:43:12,780 --> 00:43:14,780
for the body of a ghost.

486
00:43:14,780 --> 00:43:16,780
You know it very well.

487
00:43:16,780 --> 00:43:19,780
Once you remove the phoenix from the god's eyes,

488
00:43:19,780 --> 00:43:22,780
your real life will be ruined soon.

489
00:43:24,780 --> 00:43:25,780
You know me well.

490
00:43:27,780 --> 00:43:28,780
But it's weird.

491
00:43:30,780 --> 00:43:32,780
Wen Zongyu is so cruel.

492
00:43:34,780 --> 00:43:36,780
Even his disciples can sacrifice.

493
00:43:37,780 --> 00:43:39,780
I've always told you.

494
00:43:39,780 --> 00:43:42,780
The human body of Ru Xiao is stronger than the monster.

495
00:43:42,780 --> 00:43:44,780
It's even more cruel.

496
00:43:45,780 --> 00:43:47,780
You always don't believe me.

497
00:43:48,780 --> 00:43:50,780
Wen Zongyu can sacrifice even his disciples.

498
00:43:51,780 --> 00:43:53,780
You and him are not money, not fruit.

499
00:43:53,780 --> 00:43:55,780
How could you not understand this?

500
00:43:56,780 --> 00:43:58,780
Of course I understand.

501
00:43:59,780 --> 00:44:04,780
I'm just going to be his partner.

502
00:44:06,780 --> 00:44:07,780
Li Lun,

503
00:44:09,780 --> 00:44:11,780
do you know his real purpose?

504
00:44:14,780 --> 00:44:16,780
People in the world

505
00:44:17,780 --> 00:44:19,780
are so easy to understand.

506
00:44:19,780 --> 00:44:21,780
They are so hard to understand.

507
00:44:22,780 --> 00:44:24,780
Wen Zongyu is so strong.

508
00:44:25,780 --> 00:44:27,780
He wants to destroy Bai Ze Ling.

509
00:44:27,780 --> 00:44:30,780
He wants to make the Red Demon into a human body.

510
00:44:30,780 --> 00:44:32,780
That way, he can be reborn

511
00:44:32,780 --> 00:44:35,780
in the world.

512
00:44:36,780 --> 00:44:40,780
But Wen Zongyu is too naive.

513
00:44:40,780 --> 00:44:42,780
You are the naive one.

514
00:44:43,780 --> 00:44:44,780
Li Lun,

515
00:44:45,780 --> 00:44:47,780
you've lived for tens of thousands of years.

516
00:44:48,780 --> 00:44:50,780
But you're not as good as a ten-year-old child.

517
00:44:51,780 --> 00:44:53,780
Wen Zongyu has been trying to make up for it.

518
00:44:53,780 --> 00:44:55,780
He's been studying in the dark.

519
00:44:56,780 --> 00:44:59,780
He wants to make the most powerful demon.

520
00:45:00,780 --> 00:45:03,780
He wants to destroy the world with the demon.

521
00:45:04,780 --> 00:45:06,780
He wants the Yellow Dragon to become the empty one.

522
00:45:07,780 --> 00:45:09,780
That's his real purpose.

523
00:45:11,780 --> 00:45:12,780
What did you say?

524
00:45:12,780 --> 00:45:13,780
Eight years ago,

525
00:45:15,780 --> 00:45:18,780
the evil that you and I saw in the world

526
00:45:19,780 --> 00:45:22,780
were locked in the dungeon and tortured.

527
00:45:23,780 --> 00:45:26,780
It was exactly what Wen Zongyu sent people to do.

528
00:45:27,780 --> 00:45:29,780
You and I were both in the dark.

529
00:45:31,780 --> 00:45:32,780
But now,

530
00:45:34,780 --> 00:45:36,780
you're helping the evil.

531
00:45:38,780 --> 00:45:39,780
Li Lun,

532
00:45:40,780 --> 00:45:42,780
you once killed the evil.

533
00:45:43,780 --> 00:45:45,780
You said you wanted to protect the Great Emperor.

534
00:45:49,780 --> 00:45:50,780
You've forgotten.

535
00:45:52,780 --> 00:45:53,780
You've forgotten.

536
00:45:54,780 --> 00:45:55,780
You lied to me.

537
00:45:57,780 --> 00:45:58,780
You lied to me again.

538
00:45:59,780 --> 00:46:00,780
He didn't lie to you.

539
00:46:02,780 --> 00:46:03,780
What he lied to you

540
00:46:04,780 --> 00:46:05,780
has always been Wen Zongyu.

541
00:46:06,780 --> 00:46:07,780
If you don't believe me,

542
00:46:09,780 --> 00:46:11,780
go to the secret room of Chong Wuyang

543
00:46:12,780 --> 00:46:14,780
and see where you want to go.

544
00:46:22,780 --> 00:46:24,780
The Great Emperor

545
00:46:25,780 --> 00:46:27,780
The Great Emperor

546
00:46:28,780 --> 00:46:30,780
The Great Emperor

547
00:46:31,780 --> 00:46:33,780
The Great Emperor

548
00:46:34,780 --> 00:46:36,780
The Great Emperor

549
00:46:37,780 --> 00:46:39,780
The Great Emperor

550
00:46:40,780 --> 00:46:42,780
The Great Emperor

551
00:46:43,780 --> 00:46:45,780
The Great Emperor

552
00:46:46,780 --> 00:46:48,780
The Great Emperor

553
00:46:49,780 --> 00:46:51,780
The Great Emperor

554
00:46:53,780 --> 00:46:55,780
The Great Emperor

555
00:46:56,780 --> 00:46:57,780
The Great Emperor

556
00:46:58,780 --> 00:47:00,780
The Great Emperor

557
00:47:01,780 --> 00:47:03,780
The Great Emperor

558
00:47:07,780 --> 00:47:09,780
I too become the wind and have a song to play

559
00:47:10,780 --> 00:47:12,780
When I turn and look into the rain,

560
00:47:13,780 --> 00:47:15,780
I will walk by magn sinners,

561
00:47:16,780 --> 00:47:18,780
I will act first,

562
00:47:19,780 --> 00:47:21,780
during many fruits of the world,

563
00:47:22,780 --> 00:47:24,780
I won't give up my life

564
00:47:24,780 --> 00:47:30,780
I will change the future with the sky

565
00:47:30,780 --> 00:47:34,780
The summer and the winter are not with the wind

566
00:47:34,780 --> 00:47:36,780
The clouds and the moon are with the wind

567
00:47:36,780 --> 00:47:42,780
The small and small poems are a big legend

568
00:47:42,780 --> 00:47:46,780
You said that the world is full of millions

569
00:47:46,780 --> 00:47:48,780
I won't give up my life

570
00:47:48,780 --> 00:47:50,780
I said that the sky is full of millions

571
00:47:50,780 --> 00:47:54,780
The sky is the only one

572
00:47:54,780 --> 00:47:58,780
I will go on a journey with the wind

573
00:47:58,780 --> 00:48:00,780
Love is not a question

574
00:48:00,780 --> 00:48:06,780
Why not make a wish and dream is back
