[Episode 11]

3
00:02:11,650 --> 00:02:12,710
Sister Pei.

4
00:02:14,630 --> 00:02:16,070
Zhao Yuanzhou asked me

5
00:02:17,350 --> 00:02:18,360
to give you

6
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:20,390
Pei Siheng's puppet.

7
00:02:26,430 --> 00:02:28,160
I don't know what he wants to do.

8
00:02:36,070 --> 00:02:36,990
Sister Pei.

9
00:02:38,910 --> 00:02:41,150
You must want to be alone.

10
00:02:43,220 --> 00:02:44,150
Then I'll

11
00:02:44,170 --> 00:02:45,300
be off.

12
00:03:10,290 --> 00:03:11,080
Sister.

13
00:03:11,010 --> 00:03:13,710
♫If you were a spring night♫

14
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:16,400
♫I'm the silent mountain♫

15
00:03:16,730 --> 00:03:19,460
♫You're a sad firefly♫

16
00:03:19,540 --> 00:03:22,110
♫Guarding the last moment of the night♫

17
00:03:22,380 --> 00:03:25,090
♫Why don't you remember♫

18
00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:27,840
♫I'm always by your side?♫

19
00:03:27,870 --> 00:03:29,700
♫Like wind surrounding flowers♫

20
00:03:29,780 --> 00:03:32,370
♫Guarding the memories♫

21
00:03:31,510 --> 00:03:32,710
You're still alive.

22
00:03:32,579 --> 00:03:36,230
♫Never fading away♫

23
00:03:38,590 --> 00:03:39,390
Of course not.

24
00:03:40,829 --> 00:03:42,200
I died a long time ago.

25
00:03:43,910 --> 00:03:45,110
You know that.

26
00:03:48,150 --> 00:03:50,520
♫I guard the eaves♫

27
00:03:51,060 --> 00:03:52,990
♫And watch the times fade♫

28
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:59,200
♫You hold the flame and watch the night♫

29
00:03:56,190 --> 00:03:57,230
Then why are you…

30
00:03:59,150 --> 00:04:01,300
Zhao Yuanzhou used the Chaos Spell

31
00:03:59,490 --> 00:04:01,930
♫I count the winters♫

32
00:04:01,870 --> 00:04:03,550
to keep my soul.

33
00:04:02,329 --> 00:04:04,710
♫And waited for one more year♫

34
00:04:04,550 --> 00:04:06,020
I know a spell

35
00:04:05,010 --> 00:04:10,000
♫My heart is full of passion♫

36
00:04:06,070 --> 00:04:07,800
called Chaotic Impermanence.

37
00:04:08,750 --> 00:04:10,310
It can make your soul

38
00:04:10,310 --> 00:04:12,430
re-form in the puppet.

39
00:04:10,660 --> 00:04:14,410
♫The stars dazzle and the crescent moon curves♫

40
00:04:13,550 --> 00:04:14,940
But since it's chaotic,

41
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:15,650
♫The guilty greed♫

42
00:04:15,590 --> 00:04:17,080
it's orderless and ever-changing.

43
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:19,190
♫Thousands of dark hairs, long and short♫

44
00:04:18,790 --> 00:04:20,270
Maybe you won't be able to

45
00:04:19,260 --> 00:04:21,550
♫The cruel entanglement♫

46
00:04:21,080 --> 00:04:23,070
show up in this world ever again.

47
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:27,279
♫Lend me the cold lamp for one night♫

48
00:04:24,519 --> 00:04:25,660
Or maybe

49
00:04:26,370 --> 00:04:29,350
you can accompany and protect your sister every day and night.

50
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:32,600
♫Let regret stay before dawn♫

51
00:04:31,390 --> 00:04:32,460
What do you say?

52
00:04:32,670 --> 00:04:35,100
♫Turns out I'm a wanderer♫

53
00:04:35,190 --> 00:04:38,100
♫And you're a song of reluctant parting♫

54
00:04:38,140 --> 00:04:41,120
♫In the sky of floating snowflakes♫

55
00:04:41,230 --> 00:04:43,860
♫You are the only warm bloom♫

56
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:46,560
♫But why don't I remember♫

57
00:04:45,950 --> 00:04:47,310
I can occasionally…

58
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:49,280
♫How much the plot has twisted?♫

59
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:49,720
I can occasionally keep you company now.

60
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:51,490
♫I forgot the bitter karma♫

61
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:54,159
♫I missed it again and again♫

62
00:04:54,220 --> 00:04:57,780
♫Helpless♫

63
00:04:57,980 --> 00:05:00,470
♫Turns out I'm a wanderer♫

64
00:04:58,710 --> 00:04:59,670
Heng.

65
00:05:00,550 --> 00:05:03,360
♫And you're a song of reluctant parting♫

66
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:06,640
♫I'm a black-and-white wound♫

67
00:05:03,970 --> 00:05:05,680
Why are you so silly?

68
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:09,260
♫You're the vibrant red color♫

69
00:05:07,909 --> 00:05:09,550
I often got sick when I was young.

70
00:05:09,290 --> 00:05:12,080
♫How can I not remember♫

71
00:05:11,150 --> 00:05:12,470
I'd always been a burden for our family…

72
00:05:12,150 --> 00:05:14,780
♫You're always by my side?♫

73
00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:16,690
♫Like wind surrounding flowers♫

74
00:05:15,350 --> 00:05:16,510
and for you.

75
00:05:16,510 --> 00:05:18,840
I never saw you as a burden.

76
00:05:16,770 --> 00:05:24,980
♫Guarding the memories, never fading away♫

77
00:05:21,870 --> 00:05:23,530
It was for myself that I wanted

78
00:05:25,310 --> 00:05:26,870
to be a demon hunter.

79
00:05:28,630 --> 00:05:30,100
It wasn't because of you.

80
00:05:31,990 --> 00:05:34,120
You often got sick when you were young.

81
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:37,110
The medicine in the mortal world didn't work at all.

82
00:05:37,110 --> 00:05:40,310
But there might be miracles in the Wilderness.

83
00:05:42,340 --> 00:05:44,270
So I worked hard to hunt demons

84
00:05:46,030 --> 00:05:47,790
so that one day

85
00:05:49,310 --> 00:05:51,240
I could find some miraculous medicine

86
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:52,540
to cure you.

87
00:05:56,790 --> 00:05:58,190
I didn't feel tired.

88
00:06:04,070 --> 00:06:06,260
Because that was my biggest wish.

89
00:06:08,510 --> 00:06:09,310
Sister,

90
00:06:10,310 --> 00:06:11,830
your wish has come true.

91
00:06:13,790 --> 00:06:15,510
I'm very healthy

92
00:06:16,470 --> 00:06:17,510
and strong now.

93
00:06:18,430 --> 00:06:20,240
I won't make you worry anymore.

94
00:06:23,430 --> 00:06:24,840
I can even protect you.

95
00:06:32,310 --> 00:06:33,110
Sister.

96
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:38,850
Back then…

97
00:06:39,870 --> 00:06:42,200
Back then, I didn't want to become a demon.

98
00:06:43,940 --> 00:06:45,300
I was very scared.

99
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:47,909
Because

100
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:50,110
as a demon…

101
00:06:53,510 --> 00:06:55,520
I couldn't be your brother anymore.

102
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:06,540
Don't be afraid.

103
00:07:08,870 --> 00:07:10,750
If you became a demon again,

104
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:14,150
I'd become a demon with you.

105
00:07:17,330 --> 00:07:19,560
You finally learned to joke.

106
00:07:21,030 --> 00:07:22,230
Smile more.

107
00:07:25,270 --> 00:07:26,150
That's good.

108
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:34,020
So, Sister,

109
00:07:35,100 --> 00:07:35,900
look,

110
00:07:37,430 --> 00:07:38,630
no matter what…

111
00:07:41,750 --> 00:07:43,810
this is somewhat of a good ending.

112
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:47,480
Isn't it?

113
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:51,790
Sister.

114
00:07:52,850 --> 00:07:53,860
Remember

115
00:07:55,320 --> 00:07:56,230
to smile more.

116
00:07:58,500 --> 00:07:59,920
In the days to come…

117
00:08:03,460 --> 00:08:04,590
don't cry again.

118
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:15,700
You can't sleep?

119
00:09:29,410 --> 00:09:30,680
Are you guys

120
00:09:30,990 --> 00:09:32,450
going to Kunlun tomorrow?

121
00:09:32,860 --> 00:09:33,430
Yeah.

122
00:09:34,950 --> 00:09:35,750
That's great.

123
00:09:37,150 --> 00:09:37,990
How about you?

124
00:09:38,670 --> 00:09:39,930
Are you coming with us?

125
00:09:42,190 --> 00:09:43,000
Me?

126
00:09:44,100 --> 00:09:45,900
I'll pass.

127
00:09:46,690 --> 00:09:49,650
Those at the Demon Hunting Bureau need me to cook for them.

128
00:09:49,650 --> 00:09:50,980
They all like me so much.

129
00:09:55,710 --> 00:09:58,260
You'd rather stay in the mortal world as a cook

130
00:09:58,490 --> 00:10:00,030
than return to the Wilderness

131
00:10:00,030 --> 00:10:01,290
to be the Mountain God?

132
00:10:03,090 --> 00:10:03,890
Yes.

133
00:10:06,040 --> 00:10:07,200
I don't understand.

134
00:10:07,750 --> 00:10:09,280
The mortal world is so good.

135
00:10:10,410 --> 00:10:11,410
There are all kinds of

136
00:10:11,410 --> 00:10:12,610
amazing things here.

137
00:10:13,730 --> 00:10:14,990
But Grandpa and the others

138
00:10:14,990 --> 00:10:17,120
are willing to stay in the Wilderness,

139
00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:19,560
a desolate and lonely place,

140
00:10:20,380 --> 00:10:21,910
till the end of their lives.

141
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:25,330
I see no point

142
00:10:26,390 --> 00:10:28,050
in spending my life like that.

143
00:10:28,460 --> 00:10:31,010
There are many ways to live your life.

144
00:10:32,630 --> 00:10:34,540
Responsibility is a choice,

145
00:10:35,450 --> 00:10:36,690
not a constraint.

146
00:10:38,350 --> 00:10:40,480
Neither shouldering responsibility

147
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:42,600
nor pursuing dreams is wrong.

148
00:10:43,330 --> 00:10:44,290
Some people

149
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:47,180
only wish to be a quiet lake in the forest,

150
00:10:48,270 --> 00:10:49,410
while other people

151
00:10:50,190 --> 00:10:52,470
want to become a running river.

152
00:10:54,270 --> 00:10:55,280
Lady Goddess,

153
00:10:55,390 --> 00:10:56,250
what about you?

154
00:10:58,190 --> 00:10:59,350
What's your choice?

155
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:03,950
Master said

156
00:11:04,740 --> 00:11:07,470
it's not the Baize Token that made us the Goddess

157
00:11:08,710 --> 00:11:11,510
but the determination to protect the Wilderness.

158
00:11:12,020 --> 00:11:14,020
I want peace between the two worlds.

159
00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:17,010
Because in the Wilderness

160
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:20,960
and the mortal world, there are people and demons…

161
00:11:23,100 --> 00:11:24,030
that I care for.

162
00:11:27,900 --> 00:11:29,560
Come with us to Kunlun.

163
00:11:31,640 --> 00:11:34,390
Jiu is waiting for you to cook for him.

164
00:11:43,470 --> 00:11:46,070
The plan is going more smoothly than I thought.

165
00:11:46,220 --> 00:11:47,490
How about a toast?

166
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:56,030
The way you look at me

167
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,880
makes me very uncomfortable.

168
00:12:20,750 --> 00:12:22,660
The plan is going smoothly,

169
00:12:23,970 --> 00:12:26,290
but you'd better stay committed.

170
00:12:27,090 --> 00:12:29,700
Look at who I am.

171
00:12:30,830 --> 00:12:32,520
Don't get smart.

172
00:12:33,570 --> 00:12:35,150
Relax.

173
00:12:35,460 --> 00:12:37,620
We have the same goal.

174
00:12:38,140 --> 00:12:40,910
I believe we can get the Baize Token very soon.

175
00:12:41,640 --> 00:12:43,340
Aren't you happy?

176
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:46,710
Getting it

177
00:12:47,370 --> 00:12:48,780
can't make me happy.

178
00:12:51,900 --> 00:12:53,460
But destroying it

179
00:12:55,430 --> 00:12:57,400
brings me joy.

180
00:13:00,630 --> 00:13:02,150
Five days later,

181
00:13:02,840 --> 00:13:04,590
there will be a blood moon.

182
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:08,850
That's the best time to destroy the Baize Token.

183
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:12,630
So those from the Demon Hunting Bureau

184
00:13:12,630 --> 00:13:14,230
can't get to Kunlun too soon.

185
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:18,040
Do something about it.

186
00:13:18,710 --> 00:13:19,640
Don't worry.

187
00:13:21,950 --> 00:13:25,080
Qing Geng is already waiting at the foot of Mount Kunlun.

188
00:13:28,080 --> 00:13:29,650
But don't forget

189
00:13:29,860 --> 00:13:31,740
what you promised me.

190
00:13:33,140 --> 00:13:35,190
Zhao Yuanzhou's inner core,

191
00:13:35,830 --> 00:13:37,560
I'll definitely get it for you.

192
00:13:40,030 --> 00:13:42,380
What about your promise to me?

193
00:13:45,880 --> 00:13:47,510
Can you fulfill it?

194
00:13:51,280 --> 00:13:53,140
I don't need to fulfill it myself.

195
00:13:53,380 --> 00:13:55,380
Someone else will fulfill it for me.

196
00:13:55,710 --> 00:13:57,990
And she can do better than me.

197
00:14:24,330 --> 00:14:26,350
Stall them at Sinan Water Town.

198
00:14:27,580 --> 00:14:28,680
Can you do it?

199
00:14:30,930 --> 00:14:31,890
I'll try my best.

200
00:14:36,510 --> 00:14:40,770
[Lingxi Villa]

201
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:48,890
To be obsessed

202
00:14:49,710 --> 00:14:51,320
is to be trapped.

203
00:14:52,950 --> 00:14:54,930
Life is full of ups and downs.

204
00:14:55,490 --> 00:14:57,400
It's just all about obsession

205
00:14:57,880 --> 00:14:59,280
and karma.

206
00:15:07,350 --> 00:15:08,150
Wen Xiao.

207
00:15:08,590 --> 00:15:09,900
What are you writing?

208
00:15:10,410 --> 00:15:11,940
Cheng Huang was obsessed

209
00:15:12,280 --> 00:15:14,610
with keeping the Goddess alive.

210
00:15:15,590 --> 00:15:17,060
He was so obsessed

211
00:15:17,080 --> 00:15:18,910
that he swam against the tide

212
00:15:19,610 --> 00:15:21,420
and eventually hurt himself.

213
00:15:23,210 --> 00:15:24,620
Obsessions

214
00:15:25,770 --> 00:15:27,330
trap not only mortals

215
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:30,420
but also immortals.

216
00:15:33,780 --> 00:15:34,830
I'm so happy!

217
00:15:34,830 --> 00:15:36,130
We're going to Mount Kunlun.

218
00:15:36,130 --> 00:15:36,880
Let me tell you.

219
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:38,290
I've packed a lot of things in my box.

220
00:15:38,290 --> 00:15:39,290
It's very heavy.

221
00:15:43,210 --> 00:15:44,060
Brother Zhuo.

222
00:15:44,080 --> 00:15:45,720
My box is so heavy.

223
00:15:46,620 --> 00:15:47,600
Give it to me if you're tired.

224
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:48,800
I can carry it for you.

225
00:15:49,130 --> 00:15:50,990
I told you I could carry it for you.

226
00:15:53,490 --> 00:15:55,060
Thank you, Brother Zhuo.

227
00:15:55,400 --> 00:15:57,220
I'm stronger than Zhuo.

228
00:16:01,520 --> 00:16:04,780
Someone stronger is coming, in terms of malicious energy.

229
00:16:06,640 --> 00:16:07,330
Morning.

230
00:16:08,340 --> 00:16:09,180
Friends.

231
00:16:11,260 --> 00:16:12,840
Everyone is here, Ying Lei.

232
00:16:13,020 --> 00:16:14,620
Lend us your incense burner.

233
00:16:15,620 --> 00:16:17,050
Just Mount Kunlun.

234
00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:17,880
No problem.

235
00:16:18,500 --> 00:16:19,310
My turf.

236
00:16:30,350 --> 00:16:31,260
This...

237
00:16:32,680 --> 00:16:34,230
This is Mount Kunlun?

238
00:16:38,860 --> 00:16:41,040
Well… sorry.

239
00:16:41,090 --> 00:16:43,330
When I was thinking about Mount Kunlun just now,

240
00:16:43,330 --> 00:16:44,150
I suddenly thought that

241
00:16:44,150 --> 00:16:45,090
Ms. Pei once mentioned

242
00:16:45,090 --> 00:16:47,400
Sinan Water Town at the foot of Mount Kunlun

243
00:16:47,400 --> 00:16:49,090
which had an interesting Lantern Festival.

244
00:16:49,090 --> 00:16:50,530
And I got distracted.

245
00:16:52,470 --> 00:16:55,130
Sinan Water Town is at the foot of Mount Kunlun.

246
00:16:55,150 --> 00:16:57,210
I came here for investigation once.

247
00:16:57,400 --> 00:16:59,150
It happened to be during the Lantern Festival,

248
00:16:59,150 --> 00:17:01,280
so I casually mentioned it to Jiu.

249
00:17:01,670 --> 00:17:03,050
Why did you eavesdrop?

250
00:17:04,840 --> 00:17:05,790
It's fine.

251
00:17:06,310 --> 00:17:06,970
Mount Kunlun is not far away.

252
00:17:06,970 --> 00:17:08,120
We just need to hike a bit.

253
00:17:08,120 --> 00:17:08,920
Hike?

254
00:17:09,030 --> 00:17:10,760
Hiking is good for your health.

255
00:17:15,099 --> 00:17:16,170
Sinan Water Town

256
00:17:16,190 --> 00:17:17,390
is a beautiful place.

257
00:17:17,410 --> 00:17:19,079
People here live in peace.

258
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:21,900
It's a wealthy paradise.

259
00:17:23,849 --> 00:17:25,099
But this place

260
00:17:26,069 --> 00:17:27,670
doesn't look like it.

261
00:17:27,910 --> 00:17:28,790
Looks like

262
00:17:30,430 --> 00:17:32,180
many people have died.

263
00:17:44,440 --> 00:17:46,680
They've arrived at Sinan Water Town.

264
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:53,860
Then we can kill him soon.

265
00:17:59,070 --> 00:18:01,290
The plague has spread across the town.

266
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:04,540
This red string can make you immune to it.

267
00:18:05,030 --> 00:18:05,970
Otherwise,

268
00:18:05,990 --> 00:18:07,320
you'll be infected too.

269
00:18:29,240 --> 00:18:31,090
When I came here for a case,

270
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:33,500
things were completely different.

271
00:18:33,810 --> 00:18:35,340
It's been just a few months.

272
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:37,080
What on earth has happened?

273
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:41,770
This place is so scary.

274
00:18:41,930 --> 00:18:43,350
It's like a haunted town.

275
00:18:44,780 --> 00:18:45,670
Don't be afraid.

276
00:18:45,670 --> 00:18:46,880
With me by your side,

277
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:47,550
you…

278
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:52,870
Jiu.

279
00:18:52,950 --> 00:18:54,210
With you holding me like this,

280
00:18:54,210 --> 00:18:55,560
how can I use my sword?

281
00:18:55,580 --> 00:18:57,420
But I'm really scared.

282
00:18:57,640 --> 00:18:58,980
I'll hold this instead.

283
00:19:00,540 --> 00:19:02,290
Don't pull my hair.

284
00:19:03,680 --> 00:19:04,280
Here.

285
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,050
Hold this.

286
00:19:11,850 --> 00:19:14,420
What has ruined this wealthy town

287
00:19:14,700 --> 00:19:15,900
is either war

288
00:19:16,110 --> 00:19:17,080
or plague.

289
00:19:24,100 --> 00:19:26,700
I made these detoxification pills myself.

290
00:19:27,750 --> 00:19:29,210
You each take one.

291
00:19:29,490 --> 00:19:31,950
Try not to come in contact with the residents

292
00:19:32,040 --> 00:19:32,940
or animals here.

293
00:19:32,940 --> 00:19:34,680
Stay away from dead bodies.

294
00:19:47,670 --> 00:19:49,330
How did it happen so suddenly?

295
00:19:49,470 --> 00:19:51,690
The news never reached Tiandu.

296
00:19:52,280 --> 00:19:55,080
No one knows this town is in such a grave situation.

297
00:19:56,840 --> 00:19:58,870
Let's split up to make inquiries.

298
00:20:01,650 --> 00:20:02,810
Be careful.

299
00:20:08,780 --> 00:20:09,680
Come back!

300
00:20:09,750 --> 00:20:10,920
Brother Zhuo!

301
00:20:10,920 --> 00:20:12,710
Brother Zhuo!

302
00:20:19,970 --> 00:20:22,370
Before we find out the source of the plague,

303
00:20:22,680 --> 00:20:24,320
we have to isolate this place

304
00:20:24,930 --> 00:20:27,660
to prevent the plague and miasma from spreading.

305
00:20:27,920 --> 00:20:30,180
Zhao Yuanzhou, lend me your Baize Token.

306
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:32,290
You want to hold my hand?

307
00:20:34,150 --> 00:20:35,400
No problem.

308
00:21:02,230 --> 00:21:04,000
Now, to you, is he

309
00:21:04,520 --> 00:21:07,320
the cruel demon who killed your father and brother

310
00:21:07,880 --> 00:21:09,940
or a friend who fights alongside you?

311
00:21:12,590 --> 00:21:13,550
Both.

312
00:21:16,270 --> 00:21:17,610
But it doesn't matter.

313
00:21:19,130 --> 00:21:20,240
No matter what,

314
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:21,520
I'll kill him myself.

315
00:21:23,070 --> 00:21:25,500
But he has half of the Baize Token now.

316
00:21:25,910 --> 00:21:27,130
I can't kill him.

317
00:21:29,750 --> 00:21:31,110
Is that the real reason?

318
00:21:36,090 --> 00:21:37,620
After we reach Mount Kunlun

319
00:21:38,230 --> 00:21:40,690
and find a way to merge the two halves of the Baize Token,

320
00:21:40,690 --> 00:21:41,780
Wen Xiao can get back

321
00:21:41,780 --> 00:21:43,630
the power of Baize Goddess.

322
00:21:44,630 --> 00:21:45,510
By then,

323
00:21:46,700 --> 00:21:48,950
I'll settle all my grudges with him.

324
00:21:52,670 --> 00:21:53,680
I didn't expect

325
00:21:53,680 --> 00:21:56,340
to find the other half of the Baize Token so soon.

326
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,260
And it happened to be with Zhao Yuanzhou.

327
00:22:00,430 --> 00:22:02,700
It seems that the universe

328
00:22:02,730 --> 00:22:04,390
is protecting the Wilderness

329
00:22:04,590 --> 00:22:05,870
and the mortal world.

330
00:22:08,530 --> 00:22:09,540
I don't think so.

331
00:22:12,270 --> 00:22:13,200
What do you mean?

332
00:22:15,790 --> 00:22:17,520
I don't think it's accidental.

333
00:22:18,330 --> 00:22:19,730
It's more like by design.

334
00:22:22,120 --> 00:22:24,430
Pei Siheng's puppet suddenly appeared,

335
00:22:24,790 --> 00:22:27,550
leading us to investigate the case of Cheng Huang

336
00:22:28,070 --> 00:22:30,520
and learn the truth about the Baize Token.

337
00:22:30,660 --> 00:22:32,200
Your brother's appearance

338
00:22:32,220 --> 00:22:34,250
is too much of a coincidence.

339
00:22:37,810 --> 00:22:39,260
You suspect my brother?

340
00:22:40,410 --> 00:22:42,470
I just suspect Cheng Huang's motive.

341
00:22:43,260 --> 00:22:46,030
Pei Siheng has always been under Cheng Huang's control,

342
00:22:46,030 --> 00:22:48,280
but Cheng Huang is leading us to catch him.

343
00:22:48,280 --> 00:22:49,940
Don't you think it's strange?

344

I have the feeling

345
00:22:53,070 --> 00:22:54,740
that we're like puppets

346

347
00:22:56,820 --> 00:22:59,130
by a pair of invisible hands.

348

Well…

353
00:23:19,960 --> 00:23:21,890
I'll go check the perimeter again.

354

I was told that

368
00:24:55,600 --> 00:24:57,730
a plague broke out in Sinan Water Town,

369
00:24:57,840 --> 00:24:59,100
so I came to have a look.

370
00:24:59,540 --> 00:25:00,750
But I didn't expect it

371
00:25:01,730 --> 00:25:03,110
to be so serious.

372
00:25:04,570 --> 00:25:06,220
It started five days ago.

373
00:25:07,380 --> 00:25:10,110
Local physicians couldn't do anything about it.

374
00:25:10,410 --> 00:25:12,670
Some people were too scared and ran away.

375
00:25:13,260 --> 00:25:14,220
Ran away?

376
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:17,000
Wouldn't they bring the plague to other towns?

377

Life here was always peaceful.

With the protection of the spiritual energy of Mount Kunlun,

379

this town never saw any plague or natural disaster.

380
00:25:23,810 --> 00:25:24,950
The only plague I know

381
00:25:24,950 --> 00:25:26,870
happened hundreds of years ago.

382
00:25:26,890 --> 00:25:28,940
It's said to have been horrible,

383
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:31,910
and almost everyone in the town died.

To end this plague,

389
00:25:40,500 --> 00:25:42,300
we need to find the source.

390
00:25:42,650 --> 00:25:44,700
There are four causes for plague: unnatural energy,

391
00:25:44,700 --> 00:25:45,800
imbalance in the seasons,

392
00:25:45,800 --> 00:25:47,060
lingering fog and dew,

393
00:25:47,060 --> 00:25:49,060
and the build-up of harmful miasma.

394
00:25:49,300 --> 00:25:51,630
I've checked them one by one.

395
00:25:52,340 --> 00:25:54,600
None of them are the cause of this plague.

396
00:25:55,710 --> 00:25:57,000
None of them are?

397
00:25:57,320 --> 00:25:58,920
Then what could be the cause?

398
00:25:59,110 --> 00:26:00,070
Could it be that

399
00:26:00,110 --> 00:26:01,640
there's a demon in the town?

Zhao Yuanzhou and Wen Xiao have found the source of the plague.

00:36:13,290 --> 00:36:14,440
but Mr. Zhuo.

518
00:36:14,460 --> 00:36:16,660
People don't disappear out of thin air.

519
00:36:32,450 --> 00:36:34,310
It's the blood of the Bingyi Clan.

520
00:36:35,250 --> 00:36:37,020
Mr. Zhuo must have been hurt.

521
00:36:43,450 --> 00:36:44,380
Open the coffin.

522
00:37:10,410 --> 00:37:11,970
The Cloud Light Sword

523
00:37:12,560 --> 00:37:14,570
is indeed worthy of its reputation.

524
00:37:15,730 --> 00:37:18,530
In ancient times, the Bingyi Clan killed Ying Long

525
00:37:19,060 --> 00:37:20,980
and used its horns

526
00:37:22,020 --> 00:37:23,190
and soul

527
00:37:23,190 --> 00:37:24,960
to make two Cloud Light Swords.

528
00:37:25,710 --> 00:37:28,370
They can kill all demons in the world.

529
00:37:28,570 --> 00:37:30,170
Of course they're powerful.

530
00:37:30,720 --> 00:37:34,580
Only the descendants of the Bingyi Clan can use the Cloud Light Sword.

531
00:37:34,600 --> 00:37:36,460
If you want to kill Zhao Yuanzhou…

532
00:37:39,690 --> 00:37:41,160
you have to rely on him.

533
00:37:52,010 --> 00:37:56,040
[Carry on the Legacy]

534
00:38:06,010 --> 00:38:07,080
Red string?

535
00:38:08,610 --> 00:38:10,270
This body has a red string too.

536
00:38:15,990 --> 00:38:17,250
This body also has one.

537
00:38:28,880 --> 00:38:29,990
What can you smell?

538
00:38:32,480 --> 00:38:33,380
Nothing.

539
00:38:33,400 --> 00:38:34,160
Just weird.

540
00:38:34,830 --> 00:38:35,700
Tsk,

541
00:38:35,720 --> 00:38:37,650
we should've brought a dog with us.

542
00:38:41,450 --> 00:38:42,390
You're being

543
00:38:42,410 --> 00:38:44,090
very rude to the Mountain God!

544
00:38:44,120 --> 00:38:45,300
Pointing your finger at me

545
00:38:45,300 --> 00:38:46,100
is even ruder.

546
00:38:46,130 --> 00:38:46,750
You're rude.

547
00:38:46,750 --> 00:38:48,010
You're rude.

548
00:38:51,450 --> 00:38:52,440
Great Demon.

549
00:38:54,120 --> 00:38:55,750
What are you doing?

550
00:38:55,780 --> 00:38:58,380
I want to experience the feeling of lying dead.

551
00:38:58,620 --> 00:38:59,370
Wen Xiao.

552
00:38:59,400 --> 00:39:00,730
Do you want to have a try?

553
00:39:01,170 --> 00:39:03,240
Bring Jiu with you.

554
00:39:03,870 --> 00:39:05,150
Zhuo bled.

555
00:39:05,150 --> 00:39:06,870
You'll definitely get hurt too.

556
00:39:06,870 --> 00:39:08,670
It's safer to bring

557
00:39:08,670 --> 00:39:09,870
a physician with you.

558
00:39:09,870 --> 00:39:11,070
Xiao.

559
00:39:11,480 --> 00:39:12,470
He

560
00:39:12,810 --> 00:39:13,810
is a bad influence

561
00:39:15,190 --> 00:39:16,120
on you.

562
00:39:17,120 --> 00:39:18,060
No.

563
00:39:18,090 --> 00:39:18,970
I refuse.

564
00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:20,630
I feel insecure when I'm with him.

565
00:39:20,630 --> 00:39:21,430
You can't refuse.

566
00:39:21,430 --> 00:39:22,430
I'll protect you.

567
00:39:53,430 --> 00:39:55,330
Zhao Yuanzhou is really smart.

568
00:39:55,770 --> 00:39:57,770
Something is wrong with the coffin.

569
00:39:57,940 --> 00:39:58,600
Wait.

570
00:39:59,090 --> 00:40:00,230
Why is it wet here?

571
00:40:53,560 --> 00:40:55,170
You're actually awake?

572
00:41:51,470 --> 00:41:52,570
Who on earth

573
00:41:52,800 --> 00:41:53,840
are you?

574
00:41:55,320 --> 00:41:56,290
Qing Geng.

575
00:41:58,320 --> 00:41:59,110
A demon?

576
00:42:01,220 --> 00:42:02,020
A demon.

577
00:42:04,480 --> 00:42:05,720
However,

578
00:42:06,310 --> 00:42:08,040
without the Cloud Light Sword,

579
00:42:08,510 --> 00:42:10,510
the famous Zhuo Yichen

580
00:42:10,530 --> 00:42:12,590
can only be under the thumb of a demon.

581
00:42:14,720 --> 00:42:16,970
I didn't expect you to be so bold

582
00:42:17,280 --> 00:42:18,740
as to pretend to be in a coma

583
00:42:18,760 --> 00:42:20,890
and throw yourself into danger alone.

584
00:42:21,490 --> 00:42:23,990
You're indeed a descendant of the Bingyi Clan.

585
00:42:23,990 --> 00:42:26,250
If I hadn't pretended to be unconscious,

586
00:42:26,510 --> 00:42:28,130
how could I have found out

587
00:42:28,260 --> 00:42:29,950
your secret plot?

588
00:42:30,350 --> 00:42:32,300
Once Zhao Yuanzhou is dead,

589
00:42:32,490 --> 00:42:34,070
I can get his inner core

590
00:42:34,710 --> 00:42:36,700
and finish my unfinished business.

591
00:42:36,700 --> 00:42:38,700
Then I'll give his inner core to you.

592
00:42:40,770 --> 00:42:43,260
You want Zhao Yuanzhou's inner core

593
00:42:43,940 --> 00:42:45,880
but can't kill him.

594
00:42:46,940 --> 00:42:47,820
So,

595
00:42:48,160 --> 00:42:50,010
you need me to do it.

596
00:42:51,400 --> 00:42:52,850
To be precise,

597
00:42:53,380 --> 00:42:55,030
I need your sword.

598
00:42:55,770 --> 00:42:57,410
Only the Cloud Light Sword

599
00:42:57,440 --> 00:42:59,460
can kill Zhao Yuanzhou

600
00:43:00,250 --> 00:43:01,910
and help me get his inner core.

601
00:43:03,920 --> 00:43:06,340
Who brought me here?

602
00:43:06,840 --> 00:43:08,370
You don't need to know that.

603
00:43:08,720 --> 00:43:09,640
If you don't

604
00:43:09,980 --> 00:43:12,380
tell me who is behind this

605
00:43:13,360 --> 00:43:14,800
and what they want,

606
00:43:16,200 --> 00:43:19,490
I'll never help you kill Zhao Yuanzhou.

607
00:43:23,360 --> 00:43:24,230
Interesting.

608
00:43:25,210 --> 00:43:27,350
He killed your father and brother,

609
00:43:27,470 --> 00:43:28,730
yet you really see him as a friend

610
00:43:28,730 --> 00:43:30,240
who fights alongside you?

611
00:43:31,850 --> 00:43:33,130
I'll kill him,

612
00:43:34,950 --> 00:43:37,010
but it has nothing to do with you guys.

613
00:43:40,250 --> 00:43:43,000
Mortals are really hard to understand.

614
00:43:43,950 --> 00:43:46,150
I'm kindly helping you to take revenge,

615
00:43:46,200 --> 00:43:47,800
but you don't appreciate it.

616
00:43:58,320 --> 00:44:01,330
This was originally a spine from the fierce beast Qin Yuan in the Wilderness.

617
00:44:01,330 --> 00:44:03,050
Surprisingly, it's been made

618
00:44:03,110 --> 00:44:04,970
into a needle in the mortal world.

619
00:44:06,380 --> 00:44:08,980
They all say demons are cold-blooded and evil.

620
00:44:09,730 --> 00:44:12,120
But humans are worse.

621
00:44:13,540 --> 00:44:15,910
It's said that if one is jabbed by it,

622
00:44:16,220 --> 00:44:18,210
they'll suffer greatly

623
00:44:19,360 --> 00:44:21,040
and wish they were dead.

624
00:44:30,690 --> 00:44:33,520
The Cloud Light Sword can actually feel your pain.

625
00:44:34,290 --> 00:44:35,360
Are you afraid?

626
00:44:56,680 --> 00:44:57,400
Are you

627
00:44:57,670 --> 00:44:58,820
afraid?

628
00:45:03,020 --> 00:45:04,400
I only

629
00:45:04,630 --> 00:45:06,880
follow my heart.

630
00:45:07,160 --> 00:45:09,420
I don't take orders from anyone.

631
00:45:11,880 --> 00:45:14,030
People say humans are greedy,

632
00:45:14,070 --> 00:45:15,030
cowardly,

633
00:45:15,100 --> 00:45:16,070
and selfish.

634
00:45:17,180 --> 00:45:19,510
They stop at nothing to get what they want.

635
00:45:20,100 --> 00:45:20,900
Are you

636
00:45:21,140 --> 00:45:22,440
any different?

637
00:45:25,650 --> 00:45:27,750
Try me.

638
00:45:29,140 --> 00:45:30,220
Sure.

639
00:45:30,920 --> 00:45:33,260
Mr. Zhuo, since you're so stubborn…

640
00:45:37,320 --> 00:45:38,790
how about now?

641
00:45:46,540 --> 00:45:48,690
Kill Zhao Yuanzhou for me.

642
00:45:49,460 --> 00:45:50,750
Let's do it together.

643
00:45:53,910 --> 00:45:55,850
You'll help me,

644
00:45:56,210 --> 00:45:57,190
won't you?

645
00:46:01,560 --> 00:46:02,550
Say

646
00:46:03,050 --> 00:46:04,420
you will.

647
00:46:05,120 --> 00:46:06,360
I

648
00:46:07,140 --> 00:46:08,170
will.
