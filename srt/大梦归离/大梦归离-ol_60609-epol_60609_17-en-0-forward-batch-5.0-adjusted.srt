[Episode 17]

3
00:01:53,430 --> 00:01:54,360
Dream.

4
00:02:08,070 --> 00:02:08,870
Zhuo.

5
00:02:12,390 --> 00:02:13,190
Mr. Zhuo!

6
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:37,630
Sister Pei!

7
00:02:37,630 --> 00:02:38,770
Sister Pei.

8
00:02:54,050 --> 00:02:55,850
But you have the One-Word Spell.

9
00:02:55,870 --> 00:02:57,630
You can control me at any time.

10
00:02:57,820 --> 00:02:58,940
I know.

11
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:01,550
That's why I'll give you the ability

12
00:03:01,550 --> 00:03:03,560
to be immune to my One-Word Spell.

13
00:03:05,070 --> 00:03:05,930
Dream.

14
00:04:13,580 --> 00:04:14,770
Ying Zhao.

15
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:17,730
Do it now.

16
00:04:20,390 --> 00:04:21,769
Kill me!

17
00:04:46,650 --> 00:04:47,990
I killed her.

18
00:04:49,210 --> 00:04:50,920
I killed so many people.

19
00:04:53,330 --> 00:04:55,050
I don't deserve to live.

20
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:01,030
The blood moon

21
00:05:01,540 --> 00:05:03,400
is filled with malicious energy.

22
00:05:03,860 --> 00:05:05,060
What killed them

23
00:05:05,870 --> 00:05:07,630
was the persistent malicious energy

24
00:05:07,630 --> 00:05:09,900
in this world.

25
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:11,380
You

26
00:05:11,630 --> 00:05:13,220
are merely a vessel

27
00:05:13,270 --> 00:05:16,190
carrying the world's anger and murderous intent.

28
00:05:17,870 --> 00:05:20,020
If this world gave me life

29
00:05:20,430 --> 00:05:22,630
to be manipulated by malicious energy,

30
00:05:23,630 --> 00:05:25,450
then I'd rather die.

31
00:05:25,590 --> 00:05:26,880
If you died,

32
00:05:27,270 --> 00:05:29,600
there would naturally be another vessel.

33
00:05:37,030 --> 00:05:38,659
This liquid

34
00:05:38,990 --> 00:05:41,650
is made from Jade Ointment and Heartless Grass.

35
00:05:45,390 --> 00:05:47,720
It can suppress malicious energy.

36
00:05:50,570 --> 00:05:51,600
If…

37
00:05:53,980 --> 00:05:55,510
If one day

38
00:05:56,590 --> 00:05:58,630
I lose control again…

39
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:02,680
you must kill me.

40
00:06:08,030 --> 00:06:09,120
Quick!

41
00:06:10,730 --> 00:06:11,980
Kill me!

42
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:19,660
Boy.

43
00:06:22,270 --> 00:06:24,050
I have to go.

44
00:06:25,670 --> 00:06:26,490
Grandpa,

45
00:06:27,110 --> 00:06:28,470
what are you going to do?

46
00:06:32,770 --> 00:06:34,150
Mr. Ying Zhao.

47
00:06:34,470 --> 00:06:35,750
Dharma.

48
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:40,250
Return.

49
00:06:46,300 --> 00:06:47,500
Grandpa!

50
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:48,380
Grandpa!

51
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:49,340
Grandpa!

52
00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:12,660
♫Someday I'll return to my old hometown♫

53

54

Grandpa.

74
00:07:54,470 --> 00:07:54,990

♫Running towards you♫

I won't go play in the mortal world again.

I won't go to the mortal world ever again.

♫Looking for you♫

79

♫I finally heard the wind say♫

If one day

95
00:10:34,750 --> 00:10:42,430
♫Addressing love and hate♫

96
00:10:36,180 --> 00:10:38,410
I lose control again,

97
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:40,660
you must kill me.

98
00:10:41,310 --> 00:10:43,870
I'm not able to do that.

99
00:10:46,860 --> 00:10:47,890
But

100
00:10:48,810 --> 00:10:50,330
I'll think of a way.

101
00:11:31,590 --> 00:11:32,750
Do you hate him?

102
00:11:35,420 --> 00:11:36,450
I know

103
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:38,680
he was controlled by malicious energy.

104
00:11:39,740 --> 00:11:41,220
He didn't mean it.

105
00:11:43,430 --> 00:11:44,460
But he

106
00:11:46,220 --> 00:11:48,070
indeed killed my master.

107
00:11:52,010 --> 00:11:54,270
I killed my brother with my own hands too.

108
00:11:57,950 --> 00:12:00,070
Heng was controlled by Cheng Huang.

109
00:12:00,300 --> 00:12:02,430
There was nothing he could do about it.

110
00:12:02,860 --> 00:12:04,190
I worked in the Chongwu Camp

111
00:12:04,190 --> 00:12:05,470
and had to kill him.

112
00:12:06,140 --> 00:12:07,860
I had no choice either.

113
00:12:09,130 --> 00:12:10,720
After knowing the truth,

114
00:12:10,870 --> 00:12:13,070
I've been searching for a solution.

115
00:12:13,110 --> 00:12:15,490
I don't want the tragedy that befell my brother and me

116
00:12:15,490 --> 00:12:17,320
to happen to anyone else.

117
00:12:20,250 --> 00:12:21,950
But I've long forgiven you.

118
00:12:35,110 --> 00:12:36,630
Zhao Yuanzhou saved the last trace of my soul

119
00:12:36,630 --> 00:12:38,650
before it completely vanished

120
00:12:38,680 --> 00:12:40,310
and attached it to a puppet.

121
00:12:41,350 --> 00:12:43,190
It's no simple magic.

122
00:12:44,190 --> 00:12:47,720
It must have cost him at least a thousand years of magical power.

123
00:12:48,750 --> 00:12:50,940
Do you have any unfulfilled wishes?

124
00:12:51,870 --> 00:12:53,260
I wish I could

125
00:12:53,500 --> 00:12:54,960
always protect my sister.

126
00:13:15,640 --> 00:13:16,870
Wen Xiao,

127
00:13:17,630 --> 00:13:19,290
cry if you want to.

128
00:13:25,510 --> 00:13:27,490
When I was a puppet…

129
00:13:29,190 --> 00:13:30,360
I couldn't cry

130
00:13:31,410 --> 00:13:33,210
because wood didn't have tears.

131
00:14:38,450 --> 00:14:39,310
Zhu Yan!

132
00:14:39,750 --> 00:14:41,070
You brat!

133
00:14:41,230 --> 00:14:42,830
You haven't learned to control malicious energy yet,

134
00:14:42,830 --> 00:14:44,760
but you left the mountain secretly.

135
00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:47,080
You're so bold!

136
00:14:50,670 --> 00:14:51,750
I've already learned it.

137
00:14:51,750 --> 00:14:53,080
The hell you have!

138
00:14:54,870 --> 00:14:55,710
You…

139
00:14:57,230 --> 00:14:58,490
You bought them for me?

140
00:14:59,730 --> 00:15:01,190
I picked them up on the way.

141
00:16:07,910 --> 00:16:09,710
But you have the One-Word Spell.

142
00:16:09,910 --> 00:16:11,570
You can control me at any time.

143
00:16:12,510 --> 00:16:13,420
I know.

144
00:16:13,990 --> 00:16:15,490
So I'll give you the ability

145
00:16:15,490 --> 00:16:17,350
to be immune to my One-Word Spell.

146
00:16:19,710 --> 00:16:20,910
How long will it last?

147
00:16:25,480 --> 00:16:26,280
Forever.

148
00:16:29,530 --> 00:16:31,060
I'm dead set on killing you,

149
00:16:32,030 --> 00:16:34,330
yet you're giving your weapon to me.

150
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:36,490
I don't understand.

151
00:16:39,470 --> 00:16:41,130
He didn't give you a weapon.

152
00:16:41,930 --> 00:16:43,490
Instead, he gave you armor

153
00:16:44,170 --> 00:16:45,890
to fight against him.

154
00:17:01,350 --> 00:17:02,440
Mountain God.

155
00:17:06,270 --> 00:17:07,550
Do you hate him?

156
00:17:10,310 --> 00:17:10,910
Of course.

157
00:17:16,020 --> 00:17:17,210
Zhao Yuanzhou

158
00:17:17,250 --> 00:17:18,310
once

159
00:17:18,310 --> 00:17:20,190
gave me a bag of roasted walnuts.

160
00:17:20,940 --> 00:17:22,109
When I went down the mountain one day,

161
00:17:22,109 --> 00:17:23,650
I saw a stall selling them

162
00:17:24,230 --> 00:17:25,280
and tried one,

163
00:17:25,670 --> 00:17:27,460
but it nearly broke my teeth.

164
00:17:28,750 --> 00:17:29,839
Only then

165
00:17:29,869 --> 00:17:31,109
did I realize that

166
00:17:32,030 --> 00:17:35,160
not every walnut's shell was as thin and crispy as paper.

167
00:17:36,790 --> 00:17:37,630
In the past,

168
00:17:37,630 --> 00:17:39,490
every single walnut he bought for me

169
00:17:39,490 --> 00:17:42,060
had been carefully selected by him.

170
00:17:44,610 --> 00:17:45,660
Tell me,

171
00:17:45,790 --> 00:17:47,190
could someone

172
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:49,200
so attentive and kind-hearted

173
00:17:49,680 --> 00:17:51,590
be an extremely evil demon?

174
00:17:59,830 --> 00:18:00,710
As for me,

175
00:18:00,740 --> 00:18:02,420
I'm indeed old now.

176
00:18:03,230 --> 00:18:05,300
My divine power is nearly depleted.

177
00:18:07,040 --> 00:18:08,030
I hope

178
00:18:08,110 --> 00:18:10,010
that the last bit of my power

179
00:18:10,030 --> 00:18:11,710
can be of help to you guys.

180
00:18:12,630 --> 00:18:15,030
I've mastered the Bingyi Sword Technique.

181
00:18:16,070 --> 00:18:17,600
I'll kill him myself.

182
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:21,760
Mr. Zhuo.

183
00:18:22,450 --> 00:18:24,230
I'm older than you,

184
00:18:24,770 --> 00:18:26,520
so allow me to call you Zhuo.

185
00:18:28,020 --> 00:18:28,860
I know

186
00:18:28,890 --> 00:18:30,490
your hatred is hard to quell.

187
00:18:31,940 --> 00:18:33,010
But Zhao Yuanzhou

188
00:18:33,800 --> 00:18:35,800
is a pitiful person who doesn't have

189
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:37,090
many options.

190
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:38,970
All these years,

191
00:18:38,990 --> 00:18:40,510
he's been in a lot of pain

192
00:18:40,800 --> 00:18:42,650
and suffered greatly inside.

193
00:18:42,670 --> 00:18:44,330
If you don't believe me,

194
00:18:45,260 --> 00:18:46,440
find an opportunity

195
00:18:46,460 --> 00:18:48,240
to look at his back.

196
00:18:51,910 --> 00:18:53,620
Then you'll understand.

197
00:18:54,460 --> 00:18:56,630
I can use all my divine power

198
00:18:56,660 --> 00:18:57,730
to suppress

199
00:18:57,760 --> 00:18:59,760
Zhao Yuanzhou's malicious energy,

200
00:18:59,790 --> 00:19:01,250
but it won't last for long.

201
00:19:01,250 --> 00:19:02,890
One month at most.

202
00:19:19,630 --> 00:19:21,310
Are you here to kill me?

203
00:19:26,380 --> 00:19:27,480
Go ahead.

204
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:32,780
It's time to complete our deal.

205
00:19:39,630 --> 00:19:41,430
If you don't believe me,

206
00:19:41,950 --> 00:19:43,120
find an opportunity

207
00:19:43,150 --> 00:19:44,690
to look at his back.

208
00:19:46,930 --> 00:19:48,410
Then you'll understand.

209
00:19:57,960 --> 00:19:59,730
What are those scars?

210
00:20:02,580 --> 00:20:05,050
My self-inflicted punishment.

211
00:20:09,420 --> 00:20:11,250
With remorse in my heart,

212
00:20:12,580 --> 00:20:14,650
even being struck by lightning

213
00:20:17,630 --> 00:20:19,670
is not enough to appease

214
00:20:19,690 --> 00:20:21,450
the torment within.

215
00:20:24,990 --> 00:20:26,690
Eight scars.

216
00:20:27,710 --> 00:20:28,520
Eight years.

217
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:31,790
Eight years.

218
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:36,100
You had to do it to yourself

219
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:40,140
every year after the blood moon?

220
00:20:43,730 --> 00:20:45,300
After every blood moon,

221
00:20:47,110 --> 00:20:50,690
I'd imprison myself in a secluded dwelling outside Tiandu.

222
00:20:53,020 --> 00:20:54,280
Not seeing anyone,

223
00:20:55,710 --> 00:20:57,570
not returning to the Wilderness,

224
00:20:58,350 --> 00:21:00,680
until I received a message from Ying Zhao.

225
00:21:03,240 --> 00:21:04,940
Only then did I come out.

226
00:21:11,710 --> 00:21:13,240
You're not going to kill me?

227
00:21:15,950 --> 00:21:18,010
You think I'm moved by you, don't you?

228
00:21:19,790 --> 00:21:20,890
Zhao Yuanzhou.

229
00:21:21,960 --> 00:21:24,170
Life is unfair to you.

230
00:21:25,720 --> 00:21:27,520
You did things you didn't mean to

231
00:21:28,210 --> 00:21:30,090
and have regrets about them.

232
00:21:31,790 --> 00:21:34,550
You think I'll forgive you just because

233
00:21:35,790 --> 00:21:37,230
you look pitiful?

234
00:21:38,810 --> 00:21:40,070
Is that what you think?

235
00:21:41,920 --> 00:21:42,930
No.

236
00:21:44,070 --> 00:21:45,310
I ended up like this

237
00:21:45,470 --> 00:21:47,870
because I did things I shouldn't have done.

238
00:21:49,610 --> 00:21:51,450
You should hate me.

239
00:21:51,480 --> 00:21:52,640
I do hate you.

240
00:21:55,730 --> 00:21:57,870
You think dying by my sword

241
00:21:59,410 --> 00:22:01,180
can wipe the slate clean?

242
00:22:05,240 --> 00:22:06,900
Can Ying Zhao, who died for you,

243
00:22:06,900 --> 00:22:08,140
come back to life?

244
00:22:11,980 --> 00:22:14,600
Can Ying Lei's tears not be shed?

245
00:22:18,620 --> 00:22:21,310
Can Wen Xiao hug her master again?

246
00:22:27,450 --> 00:22:28,560
Can my father

247
00:22:28,590 --> 00:22:29,430
and brother

248
00:22:31,110 --> 00:22:33,640
come back to me?

249
00:22:54,020 --> 00:22:54,780
No!

250
00:22:57,670 --> 00:22:58,570
No.

251
00:23:03,170 --> 00:23:04,260
No.

252
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:10,290
No!

253
00:23:20,650 --> 00:23:21,410
No.

254
00:23:29,770 --> 00:23:31,910
If you want to die

255
00:23:32,610 --> 00:23:34,460
to settle all grudges

256
00:23:35,240 --> 00:23:37,170
and atone for your sins,

257
00:23:38,300 --> 00:23:40,560
then you don't deserve Wen Xiao's tears,

258
00:23:40,870 --> 00:23:42,870
you don't deserve Ying Lei's blood,

259
00:23:43,150 --> 00:23:47,010
and you certainly don't deserve Mountain God Ying Zhao dying for you.

260
00:23:49,310 --> 00:23:50,210
Zhao Yuanzhou,

261
00:23:52,190 --> 00:23:54,260
if you really feel remorse…

262
00:23:57,980 --> 00:23:59,710
you should do something that can truly

263
00:23:59,710 --> 00:24:01,150
make amends to everyone.

264
00:24:03,590 --> 00:24:05,150
When your debt is paid,

265
00:24:05,550 --> 00:24:06,780
I'll then come

266
00:24:07,350 --> 00:24:08,310
to kill you.

267
00:24:14,570 --> 00:24:16,770
But the Baize Token has been destroyed.

268
00:24:19,410 --> 00:24:21,320
I'm no match for Li Lun.

269
00:24:24,150 --> 00:24:25,950
The Baize Token can be repaired.

270
00:24:27,790 --> 00:24:30,190
Ying Zhao had long prepared for sacrifice,

271
00:24:30,440 --> 00:24:33,170
so he told Ying Lei in advance

272
00:24:34,190 --> 00:24:36,250
the method to repair the Baize Token.

273
00:24:36,980 --> 00:24:38,180
Go to the Wilderness.

274
00:24:39,730 --> 00:24:41,490
Find Yao Water and Divine Wood.

275
00:24:42,670 --> 00:24:44,670
Then you can repair the Baize Token.

276
00:24:47,170 --> 00:24:48,190
Zhao Yuanzhou.

277
00:24:50,900 --> 00:24:52,650
Li Lun is your sworn enemy.

278
00:24:54,250 --> 00:24:55,470
His target

279
00:24:57,250 --> 00:24:59,250
has always been you.

280
00:25:02,840 --> 00:25:04,210
You must face him.

Don't talk about death so casually.

Dying for a worthy cause

00:28:53,060 --> 00:28:55,890
♫The snowflakes are falling♫

348
00:28:55,520 --> 00:28:57,280
I feel guilty about that.

349
00:28:56,500 --> 00:29:01,480
♫A heartbeat of cold and heat♫

350
00:29:02,330 --> 00:29:05,330
♫The world is beautiful♫

351
00:29:03,410 --> 00:29:04,690
Take care of yourself.

352
00:29:05,890 --> 00:29:08,400
♫But troubled♫

353
00:29:06,470 --> 00:29:07,590
When you have time,

354
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:09,520
come back to Mount Kunlun

355
00:29:09,280 --> 00:29:13,670
♫It's going home♫

356
00:29:10,280 --> 00:29:11,440
to see me.

357
00:29:15,430 --> 00:29:19,770
♫I'm going home♫

358
00:29:18,910 --> 00:29:20,640
You've grown up.

359
00:29:23,480 --> 00:29:24,800
Choose your own way

360
00:29:24,090 --> 00:29:29,660
♫Has anyone seen a bird with a broken tail?♫

361
00:29:25,710 --> 00:29:27,300
into the future.

362
00:29:29,890 --> 00:29:35,710
♫The rain wet its feathers♫

363
00:29:32,510 --> 00:29:33,590
Grandpa.

364
00:29:38,060 --> 00:29:43,730
♫Its cry has never been heard♫

365
00:29:43,790 --> 00:29:50,400
♫Only I know its story♫

366
00:29:58,220 --> 00:29:59,040
Ying Lei.

367
00:30:03,730 --> 00:30:05,270
I'm not good at cooking,

368
00:30:06,820 --> 00:30:08,480
so I picked some plums for you.

369
00:30:10,160 --> 00:30:10,880
I just

370
00:30:10,980 --> 00:30:11,820
tried one.

371
00:30:11,890 --> 00:30:12,750
Very sweet.

372
00:30:39,340 --> 00:30:40,230
Thank you,

373
00:30:40,440 --> 00:30:41,360
Jiu.

374
00:30:42,890 --> 00:30:44,000
Young Mountain God,

375
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:44,930
you're welcome.

376
00:31:46,390 --> 00:31:47,910
Jiu picked these plums.

377
00:31:49,750 --> 00:31:51,680
Mr. Zhuo, would you like to try one?

378
00:31:54,800 --> 00:31:56,800
Jiu picked them especially for you.

379
00:31:57,320 --> 00:31:58,230
You eat them.

380
00:32:03,780 --> 00:32:05,640
These plums were high on the tree.

381
00:32:09,110 --> 00:32:11,370
It must have been hard for him to get them.

382
00:32:17,270 --> 00:32:18,440
When I was little,

383
00:32:19,960 --> 00:32:21,600
if the plums were too high

384
00:32:22,970 --> 00:32:24,430
and I couldn't reach them,

385
00:32:25,140 --> 00:32:27,030
Grandpa would pick them for me.

386
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:33,370
He's gone forever.

387
00:32:36,690 --> 00:32:37,650
Mr. Zhuo.

388
00:32:40,030 --> 00:32:41,740
Grandpa is gone.

389
00:32:48,760 --> 00:32:50,590
I no longer have a grandpa.

390
00:32:51,930 --> 00:32:54,070
I have no family left.

391
00:32:59,180 --> 00:33:00,980
When my father and brother died,

392
00:33:03,490 --> 00:33:05,560
I also lost all my family.

393
00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:19,240
Mr. Zhuo.

394
00:33:21,520 --> 00:33:22,700
Your heart

395
00:33:23,900 --> 00:33:25,770
must be covered with scars too.

396
00:33:34,110 --> 00:33:35,790
My brother once told me

397
00:33:37,680 --> 00:33:39,480
that the sufferings in the world

398
00:33:39,950 --> 00:33:41,950
always left people scarred.

399
00:33:43,820 --> 00:33:45,450
But if a part of you

400
00:33:45,480 --> 00:33:46,720
gets hurt

401
00:33:46,910 --> 00:33:48,510
and damaged again and again,

402
00:33:49,280 --> 00:33:51,030
it'll become hard and strong.

403
00:33:53,480 --> 00:33:55,060
At that time,

404
00:33:56,080 --> 00:33:57,530
I held my brother's hand,

405
00:33:57,560 --> 00:33:59,360
which he used to wield his sword,

406
00:34:00,100 --> 00:34:00,900
and said,

407
00:34:02,250 --> 00:34:03,530
"I know,

408
00:34:04,400 --> 00:34:05,800
that's called a callus."

409
00:34:07,570 --> 00:34:09,190
But my brother said

410
00:34:09,290 --> 00:34:10,670
what he was talking about

411
00:34:10,670 --> 00:34:11,810
wasn't a callus.

412
00:34:15,250 --> 00:34:16,830
What I'm talking about

413
00:34:17,130 --> 00:34:18,330
isn't a callus

414
00:34:19,960 --> 00:34:21,320
but the heart.

415
00:34:44,940 --> 00:34:46,530
What he was talking about

416
00:34:48,580 --> 00:34:49,600
wasn't a callus

417
00:34:50,520 --> 00:34:51,500
but the heart.

418
00:35:26,560 --> 00:35:28,410
You've been here all night?

419
00:35:31,610 --> 00:35:32,580
What's the matter,

420
00:35:32,580 --> 00:35:33,420
Sister Pei?

421
00:35:38,050 --> 00:35:40,140
I forgot to tell you this last night.

422
00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:42,000
Thank you.

423
00:35:48,590 --> 00:35:50,410
Look at the canyon before us.

424
00:35:51,800 --> 00:35:53,350
It's bottomless.

425
00:35:54,850 --> 00:35:56,840
If one fell off the cliff,

426
00:35:58,470 --> 00:36:00,530
even if they struggled desperately,

427
00:36:01,170 --> 00:36:03,000
they could only keep falling.

428
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:06,030
At that moment,

429
00:36:08,230 --> 00:36:10,490
we'd wish for a tree,

430
00:36:11,790 --> 00:36:13,050
a rock,

431
00:36:14,600 --> 00:36:17,040
or even a cloud to catch us.

432
00:36:21,390 --> 00:36:23,360
You helped me uncover the real reason

433
00:36:23,360 --> 00:36:24,690
why Heng killed people.

434
00:36:26,910 --> 00:36:28,230
For me,

435
00:36:29,740 --> 00:36:33,320
it was like giving me a rock wall

436
00:36:33,560 --> 00:36:35,690
that I could lean on to catch my breath.

437
00:36:42,130 --> 00:36:43,040
And you

438
00:36:44,570 --> 00:36:46,290
are Zhao Yuanzhou's tree

439
00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:47,050
and cloud.

440
00:37:02,390 --> 00:37:03,790
Neither a tree nor a cloud

441
00:37:05,080 --> 00:37:06,940
can catch someone

442
00:37:07,520 --> 00:37:09,340
who's destined to fall.

443
00:37:10,720 --> 00:37:12,500
I can't forgive him,

444
00:37:15,300 --> 00:37:17,370
but I can't hate him either.

445
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:24,130
So I can only hate myself.

446
00:37:29,860 --> 00:37:31,230
If one day

447
00:37:33,890 --> 00:37:34,950
you find out I have a secret

448
00:37:34,950 --> 00:37:36,840
as shocking as Zhao Yuanzhou's…

449
00:37:40,230 --> 00:37:41,630
would you hate me?

450
00:37:47,330 --> 00:37:48,610
That won't happen.

451
00:38:01,540 --> 00:38:02,870
Congratulations, Sir,

452
00:38:03,220 --> 00:38:05,820
for successfully destroying the Baize Token.

453
00:38:08,190 --> 00:38:09,170
The next step

454
00:38:09,720 --> 00:38:11,960
is to get Zhao Yuanzhou's inner core.

455
00:38:13,950 --> 00:38:16,750
He should've almost completed his mission by now.

456
00:38:18,080 --> 00:38:19,610
Then, Sir, your great cause

457
00:38:20,990 --> 00:38:22,190
will surely succeed.

458
00:38:42,630 --> 00:38:43,740
I'm so hungry.

459
00:38:44,680 --> 00:38:46,880
I wish I had saved more plums yesterday.

460
00:38:52,070 --> 00:38:52,870
Brother Zhuo.

461
00:38:53,130 --> 00:38:54,730
I brought you some food.

462
00:38:55,240 --> 00:38:56,290
Ying Lei said

463
00:38:56,620 --> 00:38:58,550
this is a delicacy from the Wilderness.

464
00:38:58,550 --> 00:38:59,610
It's called Zhuyu.

465
00:39:06,830 --> 00:39:07,970
Are you still angry?

466
00:39:09,360 --> 00:39:10,340
Yeah.

467
00:39:10,370 --> 00:39:12,900
Being suspected by someone you respect

468
00:39:13,020 --> 00:39:14,490
is indeed no small matter.

469
00:39:14,550 --> 00:39:16,340
You should be angry.

470
00:39:16,850 --> 00:39:17,980
Brother Zhuo,

471
00:39:18,320 --> 00:39:20,260
you think I respect you?

472
00:39:24,280 --> 00:39:25,410
Forget what I said.

473
00:39:25,430 --> 00:39:27,270
I admire you!

474
00:39:35,620 --> 00:39:36,660
Eat. Eat up.

475
00:39:38,640 --> 00:39:39,600
Ying Lei said

476
00:39:40,180 --> 00:39:43,040
Zhuyu is a divine herb that grows in the Western Sea.

477
00:39:43,040 --> 00:39:44,390
Eating just one blade of it

478
00:39:44,390 --> 00:39:46,320
can keep you full for an entire day.

479
00:40:07,510 --> 00:40:09,240
I brought you something to eat!

480
00:40:09,390 --> 00:40:10,970
I was worried Little Bunny might be hungry,

481
00:40:10,970 --> 00:40:12,620
so I roasted some taro.

482
00:40:12,710 --> 00:40:13,510
Try it.

483
00:40:17,420 --> 00:40:18,080
Didn't you…

484
00:40:19,270 --> 00:40:21,670
Didn't you tell us to eat Zhuyu?

485
00:40:25,080 --> 00:40:27,080
You just need to hold it in your hand.

486
00:40:27,160 --> 00:40:28,440
You don't eat it.

487
00:40:32,150 --> 00:40:33,180
It's alright.

488
00:40:33,440 --> 00:40:34,200
Brother Zhuo,

489
00:40:34,200 --> 00:40:35,520
I still admire you.

490
00:40:36,300 --> 00:40:37,310
Shut up.

491
00:40:38,070 --> 00:40:38,870
Okay.

492
00:41:17,510 --> 00:41:18,510
Lady Goddess.

493
00:41:21,830 --> 00:41:23,900
Looks like you've made your choice.

494
00:41:24,110 --> 00:41:24,590
Well,

495
00:41:24,630 --> 00:41:25,720
Young Mountain God,

496
00:41:25,720 --> 00:41:28,200
you didn't look like much usually,

497
00:41:28,220 --> 00:41:30,210
but you look quite presentable today in that outfit,

498
00:41:30,210 --> 00:41:31,980
giving off a bit of the vibe of the Mountain God.

499
00:41:31,980 --> 00:41:33,020
Do I?

500
00:41:34,240 --> 00:41:36,840
This is the first time you've complimented me.

501
00:41:39,150 --> 00:41:40,400
I've made my decision.

502
00:41:40,400 --> 00:41:41,260
I'll stay here,

503
00:41:41,390 --> 00:41:42,550
protecting Kunlun,

504
00:41:43,060 --> 00:41:45,460
continuing my grandpa's unfinished work.

505
00:41:45,760 --> 00:41:48,090
With my limited power as the Mountain God,

506
00:41:48,560 --> 00:41:50,620
I'll try to delay Kunlun's collapse.

507
00:41:54,040 --> 00:41:55,570
You're staying here?

508
00:42:01,540 --> 00:42:02,310
Yes.

509
00:42:05,820 --> 00:42:08,080
I'm not going to the Wilderness with you.

510
00:42:11,810 --> 00:42:12,960
Take care, guys.

511
00:42:15,050 --> 00:42:16,590
We'll meet again.

512
00:42:19,740 --> 00:42:21,940
I'll do my best to be a good Mountain God…

513
00:42:25,010 --> 00:42:26,510
to make my grandpa proud.

514
00:42:27,950 --> 00:42:29,070
Your grandpa

515
00:42:30,300 --> 00:42:32,310
was always proud of you.

516
00:42:35,080 --> 00:42:35,880
Ying Lei.

517
00:42:37,130 --> 00:42:38,320
Take care.

518
00:42:41,990 --> 00:42:43,000
Okay.

519
00:42:53,090 --> 00:42:54,150
This…

520
00:43:01,100 --> 00:43:01,980
It's for you.

521
00:43:05,360 --> 00:43:06,820
The journey ahead is long.

522
00:43:07,160 --> 00:43:08,080
I hope

523
00:43:08,110 --> 00:43:09,180
it'll be of help.

524
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:13,590
Yeah.

525
00:43:15,310 --> 00:43:17,710
We'll inevitably have to run for our lives.

526
00:43:21,670 --> 00:43:22,470
Take care.

527
00:43:23,040 --> 00:43:24,190
Next time we come back,

528
00:43:24,190 --> 00:43:26,650
make the most delicious dishes for me, okay?

529
00:43:28,480 --> 00:43:29,890
I'm not used to it.

530
00:43:31,600 --> 00:43:32,540
Indeed.

531
00:43:33,320 --> 00:43:34,690
This outfit

532
00:43:35,410 --> 00:43:37,210
is new to me too.

533
00:43:38,820 --> 00:43:39,820
Maybe

534
00:43:39,850 --> 00:43:41,480
I should grow my beard back.

535
00:43:42,010 --> 00:43:45,080
Otherwise, I really just look like a child in adults' clothing.

536
00:43:45,080 --> 00:43:46,320
I mean,

537
00:43:46,640 --> 00:43:48,300
you'll not be around anymore,

538
00:43:48,870 --> 00:43:50,310
and I'm not used to that.

539
00:43:52,670 --> 00:43:54,400
Even though you're quite noisy

540
00:43:54,650 --> 00:43:56,050
and annoying sometimes.

541
00:43:56,920 --> 00:43:57,410
Ah,

542
00:43:57,440 --> 00:43:58,180
never mind.

543
00:43:59,030 --> 00:44:00,000
At least

544
00:44:00,840 --> 00:44:02,840
when Brother Zhuo wasn't around

545
00:44:03,430 --> 00:44:04,600
and I was scared,

546
00:44:05,400 --> 00:44:06,660
I could hold your arm,

547
00:44:07,670 --> 00:44:08,650
grab your hand,

548
00:44:10,150 --> 00:44:11,410
and seize your sleeve.

549
00:44:13,760 --> 00:44:15,810
Then I'll cut off a piece of my sleeve for you.

550
00:44:15,810 --> 00:44:17,250
When you're afraid,

551
00:44:17,720 --> 00:44:18,850
you can hold it tight

552
00:44:19,110 --> 00:44:20,990
as if I were by your side.

553
00:44:21,430 --> 00:44:22,670
I don't need that.

554
00:44:23,190 --> 00:44:26,540
In the mortal world, cutting off the sleeve means cutting ties.

555
00:44:26,540 --> 00:44:28,600
I don't want to be an ingrate.

556
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:31,750
Jiu.

557
00:44:33,630 --> 00:44:34,950
You'll surely become

558
00:44:35,600 --> 00:44:37,400
the best physician in the world.

559
00:44:38,830 --> 00:44:39,630
Good luck.

560
00:44:40,330 --> 00:44:41,530
I'll miss you.

561
00:45:04,310 --> 00:45:05,040
We will.

562
00:45:11,290 --> 00:45:12,910
We'll meet again.

563
00:45:13,740 --> 00:45:14,580
Yeah.
