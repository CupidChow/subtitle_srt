[Episode 5]

3
00:01:59,990 --> 00:02:00,790
Sister,

4
00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:05,240
why do you want to kill me?

5
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:14,620
Sister,

6
00:02:16,670 --> 00:02:18,170
you misunderstood me.

7
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:21,700
Brother,

8
00:02:22,750 --> 00:02:24,810
you're unforgivable.

9
00:02:26,130 --> 00:02:27,620
Don't blame me.

10
00:03:08,790 --> 00:03:10,720
You actually have the guts to come.

11
00:03:11,310 --> 00:03:12,400
If I didn't come,

12
00:03:12,670 --> 00:03:14,160
they would be in danger.

13
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:15,830
You colluded with Ran Yi.

14
00:03:15,870 --> 00:03:17,990
That's what put them in danger.

15
00:03:19,710 --> 00:03:20,510
Colluded?

16
00:03:21,270 --> 00:03:23,420
Mr. Zhuo, your words are so harsh.

17
00:03:23,730 --> 00:03:25,630
Ran Yi and I just collaborated

18
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:27,460
to get what we need.

19
00:03:27,650 --> 00:03:29,710
When you came to the Demon Hunting Bureau,

20
00:03:29,710 --> 00:03:31,950
you also said you wanted to collaborate with us.

21
00:03:31,950 --> 00:03:34,260
Which part of what you said

22
00:03:34,350 --> 00:03:35,690
is true?

23
00:03:36,230 --> 00:03:38,030
Mr. Zhuo, every word I said to you

24
00:03:38,030 --> 00:03:39,930
is true.

25
00:03:40,140 --> 00:03:41,850
I only lie to little girls.

26
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:42,910
Nonsense.

27
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:47,310
You...

28
00:03:49,430 --> 00:03:51,910
I can tell you the details.

29
00:03:52,070 --> 00:03:53,579
But if we don't save them now,

30
00:03:53,579 --> 00:03:55,030
it'll be too late.

31
00:04:23,870 --> 00:04:26,680
Then... how can we deal with Ran Yi?

32
00:04:27,030 --> 00:04:30,030
Actually, there's another way, which is the easiest.

33
00:04:31,070 --> 00:04:32,500
Make the dreamers

34
00:04:32,990 --> 00:04:34,570
die in their dreams.

35
00:04:34,750 --> 00:04:35,850
So easy?

36
00:04:35,990 --> 00:04:37,650
They can just commit suicide.

37
00:04:37,830 --> 00:04:39,750
Committing suicide is indeed easy,

38
00:04:39,750 --> 00:04:41,250
but not everyone

39
00:04:41,470 --> 00:04:43,200
has the guts to commit suicide.

40
00:04:44,110 --> 00:04:45,550
Will you commit suicide now?

41
00:04:45,550 --> 00:04:47,140
Why would I commit suicide?

42
00:04:47,310 --> 00:04:49,470
I'm not in a dream created by Ran Yi.

43
00:04:49,830 --> 00:04:51,030
Are you sure?

44
00:04:51,570 --> 00:04:53,090
How can you be sure?

45
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:21,450
Looks like you've started to understand.

46
00:05:22,110 --> 00:05:23,500
If there's something

47
00:05:23,670 --> 00:05:25,990
that can penetrate the dreams created by Ran Yi,

48
00:05:25,990 --> 00:05:26,790
maybe...

49
00:05:26,790 --> 00:05:28,030
As far as I know,

50
00:05:28,830 --> 00:05:29,960
nothing can do that.

51
00:05:44,070 --> 00:05:45,370
The Cloud Light Sword

52
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:46,830
can kill demons and evil spirits.

53
00:05:46,830 --> 00:05:48,760
It won't be tainted by evil spirits

54
00:05:48,870 --> 00:05:51,820
and can break all the illusions in the world.

55
00:07:38,550 --> 00:07:41,080
Why can't Wen Xiao hear the sound of the sword?

56
00:07:46,390 --> 00:07:47,190
Forget it.

57
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:50,360
I'll go look for her in the dream.

58
00:08:43,070 --> 00:08:44,280
Don't be afraid.

59
00:08:46,370 --> 00:08:47,700
Demons and evil spirits

60
00:08:48,040 --> 00:08:49,670
are just illusions.

61
00:08:49,870 --> 00:08:52,020
Everything is not real.

62
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:53,800
You just need to wake up.

63
00:08:57,230 --> 00:08:59,120
What should I do to wake up?

64
00:09:01,430 --> 00:09:02,510
To wake up...

65
00:09:54,730 --> 00:09:55,850
That was...

66
00:10:06,170 --> 00:10:07,570
A dream created by Ran Yi.

67
00:10:21,390 --> 00:10:23,020
You didn't fall into a dream?

68
00:10:26,750 --> 00:10:28,490
I don't know why either.

69
00:10:31,900 --> 00:10:32,740
Ms. Pei.

70
00:10:35,510 --> 00:10:36,610
What's going on?

71
00:10:38,490 --> 00:10:41,550
This is the backfire from Ran Yi's dream control magic.

72
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:43,090
Dreamers

73
00:10:43,540 --> 00:10:45,760
having a stronger obsession with the illusions in their dreams

74
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:47,240
would suffer

75
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:48,780
greater physical damage.

76
00:10:51,470 --> 00:10:53,390
How come I haven't been affected?

77
00:10:55,750 --> 00:10:56,760
My obsession...

78
00:11:00,030 --> 00:11:01,400
It's indeed very strange.

79
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:03,260
Even Ms. Pei, who has practiced martial arts for years,

80
00:11:03,260 --> 00:11:04,590
failed to withstand it.

81
00:11:05,230 --> 00:11:07,290
You've always been physically weak,

82
00:11:07,380 --> 00:11:08,870
but you're fine this time.

83
00:11:15,530 --> 00:11:16,710
Zhao Yuanzhou,

84
00:11:16,990 --> 00:11:19,220
now we should have a good talk.

85
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:21,770
The one you should talk to is not me,

86
00:11:24,730 --> 00:11:25,970
but Ran Yi.

87
00:11:28,840 --> 00:11:30,220
He really is here.

88
00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:33,710
Don't waste time.

89
00:11:33,970 --> 00:11:35,870
Let's go find him.

90
00:11:39,210 --> 00:11:40,160
Ms. Pei!

91
00:11:41,790 --> 00:11:42,960
What's wrong?

92
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:49,960
I'll take you to Ran Yi.

93
00:11:49,980 --> 00:11:51,700
But Ms. Pei, stop acting tough.

94
00:11:51,700 --> 00:11:53,240
Just stay here.

95
00:11:53,260 --> 00:11:54,920
Save us some trouble.

96
00:11:55,790 --> 00:11:56,590
I can't just let them

97
00:11:56,590 --> 00:11:57,850
go with you.

98
00:11:58,680 --> 00:11:59,310
Who knows

99
00:11:59,310 --> 00:12:01,690
if you'll lure them into another trap?

100
00:12:18,490 --> 00:12:20,260
When I had nightmares,

101
00:12:21,300 --> 00:12:23,710
my father would always write different Chinese characters

102
00:12:23,710 --> 00:12:25,290
in my palm.

103
00:12:25,870 --> 00:12:28,070
He said as long as I held onto it tightly,

104
00:12:28,490 --> 00:12:30,370
it would dispel the bad dreams.

105
00:12:36,100 --> 00:12:36,950
Don't worry.

106
00:12:37,560 --> 00:12:39,670
I have a way to deal with the great demon.

107
00:12:39,670 --> 00:12:41,070
Everything will be fine.

108
00:12:44,780 --> 00:12:46,910
You always had nightmares in the past?

109
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:57,510
Jiu asked me

110
00:12:57,670 --> 00:12:59,870
to take this bottle of medicine with me.

111
00:13:00,190 --> 00:13:01,250
Take it.

112
00:13:01,390 --> 00:13:03,720
It should help with your internal injury.

113
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:16,410
Thank you.

114
00:13:22,460 --> 00:13:23,740
Well, well, well.

115
00:13:23,990 --> 00:13:25,470
You're helping each other.

116
00:13:25,470 --> 00:13:27,530
You guys share a deep bond.

117
00:13:27,870 --> 00:13:29,770
You're doing this in front of me, huh?

118
00:13:29,770 --> 00:13:31,230
You think I'll lose to you?

119
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:41,960
Protect.

120
00:13:46,310 --> 00:13:48,510
This barrier can protect her.

121
00:13:48,540 --> 00:13:50,210
It's much more practical than

122
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:51,890
your Chinese character

123
00:13:52,290 --> 00:13:53,370
and your medicine.

124
00:13:54,270 --> 00:13:54,830
You...

125
00:13:55,310 --> 00:13:56,390
Let's go.

126
00:15:16,870 --> 00:15:18,130
The Cloud Light Sword.

127
00:15:21,330 --> 00:15:23,290
It's been over ten years.

128
00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:26,290
I didn't expect to see it again.

129
00:15:27,190 --> 00:15:28,460
Over ten years?

130
00:15:29,930 --> 00:15:31,250
You know my brother?

131
00:15:33,540 --> 00:15:34,880
More than ten years ago,

132
00:15:35,280 --> 00:15:36,790
I came to the mortal world.

133
00:15:37,020 --> 00:15:39,940
I met a man holding the Cloud Light Sword.

134
00:15:40,190 --> 00:15:41,350
He saved me.

135
00:15:43,550 --> 00:15:45,310
It turns out he is your brother.

136
00:15:46,020 --> 00:15:48,370
But the Cloud Light Sword he was holding

137
00:15:48,790 --> 00:15:51,120
was not as powerful as the one in your hand.

138
00:15:51,830 --> 00:15:53,400
He told me

139
00:15:53,450 --> 00:15:55,370
he had a beloved younger brother

140
00:15:56,200 --> 00:15:58,200
haunted by nightmares every night.

141
00:15:59,190 --> 00:16:00,850
He asked me if I could help him.

142
00:16:02,270 --> 00:16:04,180
I gave him a scale of mine,

143
00:16:04,590 --> 00:16:08,120
telling him to grind it into powder and mix it with water to take.

144
00:16:08,150 --> 00:16:08,990
After that,

145
00:16:09,190 --> 00:16:10,070
his younger brother

146
00:16:10,070 --> 00:16:12,220
was no longer troubled by nightmares

147
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:14,580
and was no longer afraid anymore.

148
00:16:16,230 --> 00:16:17,030
Brother,

149
00:16:18,470 --> 00:16:19,730
I dare not fall asleep.

150
00:16:21,590 --> 00:16:22,520
If I fall asleep,

151
00:16:22,590 --> 00:16:25,050
I would dream of myself turning into a demon.

152
00:16:26,130 --> 00:16:28,150
No one would play with me.

153
00:16:30,360 --> 00:16:31,430
It's okay.

154
00:16:32,640 --> 00:16:34,900
Dreams reflect the opposite of reality.

155
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:39,890
I'm here.

156
00:16:40,980 --> 00:16:41,910
Don't be afraid.

157
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:47,170
♫Footsteps echo, one by one♫

158

I see.

168
00:17:22,530 --> 00:17:23,349
So, Zhuo,

169
00:17:23,349 --> 00:17:25,670
that's why you haven't dreamed

170
00:17:26,390 --> 00:17:27,430
all these years.

171
00:17:37,450 --> 00:17:39,090
You had a good brother.

172
00:17:41,550 --> 00:17:42,650
Unfortunately...

173
00:17:45,230 --> 00:17:46,440
I killed him.

174
00:17:52,630 --> 00:17:54,560
My brother didn't want me to dream.

175
00:17:56,390 --> 00:17:57,640
But Zhao Yuanzhou,

176
00:17:58,450 --> 00:17:59,940
you killed them.

177
00:18:00,650 --> 00:18:01,930
You have imprisoned me

178
00:18:02,470 --> 00:18:04,270
in a nightmare for so many years.

179
00:18:05,210 --> 00:18:07,010
When you kill me one day,

180
00:18:07,870 --> 00:18:10,130
you can wake up from the nightmare.

181
00:18:19,310 --> 00:18:21,130
But you know it's not today

182
00:18:22,010 --> 00:18:23,350
or now.

183
00:18:26,750 --> 00:18:28,060
Then tell me,

184
00:18:29,110 --> 00:18:30,770
why did you help Ran Yi?

185
00:18:33,090 --> 00:18:34,550
Interesting.

186
00:18:37,780 --> 00:18:39,700
You humans call it a virtue

187
00:18:41,070 --> 00:18:42,580
when you help one another.

188
00:18:43,110 --> 00:18:45,060
But for us demons,

189
00:18:45,090 --> 00:18:47,220
helping each other requires a reason.

190
00:18:47,740 --> 00:18:49,670
You always inflict harm on demons,

191
00:18:49,870 --> 00:18:52,670
but you can always come up with excuses.

192
00:18:54,310 --> 00:18:55,170
Zhao Yuanzhou,

193
00:18:56,070 --> 00:18:57,640
I told you this long ago.

194
00:18:57,870 --> 00:18:59,080
Humans and demons

195
00:18:59,190 --> 00:19:01,030
can never get along well.

196
00:19:03,470 --> 00:19:04,340
Really?

197
00:19:06,300 --> 00:19:07,030
Then why do you

198
00:19:07,030 --> 00:19:09,230
insist on being with Miss Qi?

199
00:19:14,510 --> 00:19:17,150
I told you Wen Xiao and Mr. Zhuo are smart.

200
00:19:17,870 --> 00:19:19,400
You can't hide it from them.

201
00:19:20,190 --> 00:19:21,230
Where's Miss Qi?

202
00:19:22,990 --> 00:19:24,830
My daughter was so frightened

203
00:19:24,830 --> 00:19:26,030
that she caught a cold.

204
00:19:26,030 --> 00:19:28,230
It's not convenient for her to meet you.

205
00:20:19,740 --> 00:20:21,180
Who are you guys?

206
00:20:23,110 --> 00:20:24,710
Why did you save me?

207
00:20:26,670 --> 00:20:28,620
Why didn't you let me die?

208
00:20:31,260 --> 00:20:32,560
It's easy to die,

209
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:35,570
but it can't solve any problem.

210
00:20:37,030 --> 00:20:40,230
It will only hurt the feelings of those who care about you.

211
00:20:49,820 --> 00:20:51,470
In the boundless azure sea,

212
00:20:52,660 --> 00:20:54,110
there is no path.

213
00:20:55,590 --> 00:20:57,470
Yet in the mortal world,

214
00:21:00,610 --> 00:21:02,610
in the vastness of the starry river,

215
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,580
I hold your hand,

216
00:21:06,440 --> 00:21:08,570
traveling around the world together.

217
00:21:22,030 --> 00:21:25,030
The only person caring about me also died.

218
00:21:25,050 --> 00:21:27,050
Why should I live?

219
00:21:28,100 --> 00:21:29,350
Ran Yi Fish?

220
00:21:31,330 --> 00:21:32,860
Is the person you mentioned

221
00:21:33,160 --> 00:21:34,680
Ran Yi?

222
00:21:36,540 --> 00:21:38,160
You know him?

223
00:21:43,110 --> 00:21:44,230
He's not dead.

224
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:49,700
We can take you to him.

225
00:21:52,190 --> 00:21:53,720
You actually put her in a sack?

226
00:21:53,720 --> 00:21:54,910
This is not Miss Qi.

227
00:21:55,790 --> 00:21:56,790
This is Master Qi.

228
00:22:01,030 --> 00:22:02,430
We just caught him

229
00:22:02,430 --> 00:22:04,690
and didn't have time to interrogate him.

230
00:22:05,110 --> 00:22:07,370
He's still in the dream created by Ran Yi.

231
00:22:08,750 --> 00:22:09,910
He deserves it.

232
00:22:11,550 --> 00:22:13,220
He can never wake up.

233
00:22:14,950 --> 00:22:16,310
Master Qi is guilty,

234
00:22:17,740 --> 00:22:20,680
but he should be convicted by the Demon Hunting Bureau.

235
00:22:20,680 --> 00:22:23,940
You demons can't abuse your power out of personal grudges.

236
00:22:24,900 --> 00:22:25,700
What?

237
00:22:26,710 --> 00:22:28,350
When he asked the demon hunter

238
00:22:28,350 --> 00:22:29,150
to perform the cruel

239
00:22:29,150 --> 00:22:31,820
corpse-dissolving and demon-subduing technique on me,

240
00:22:31,820 --> 00:22:33,720
wasn't he abusing his power?

241
00:22:33,910 --> 00:22:35,510
Why didn't you mention that?

242
00:22:37,740 --> 00:22:39,740
Why is the incense burner so smelly?

243
00:22:44,570 --> 00:22:45,470
This is...

244
00:22:46,370 --> 00:22:48,570
the smell of the Demon Slaying Spell.

245
00:22:59,860 --> 00:23:02,990
The corpse-dissolving and demon-subduing technique.

246
00:23:03,630 --> 00:23:06,120
Crush a dragon's rib bones into powder,

247
00:23:06,460 --> 00:23:08,120
soak it in lime water,

248
00:23:08,440 --> 00:23:10,050
and dry it into incense.

249
00:23:11,080 --> 00:23:12,150
After it's burnt,

250
00:23:12,950 --> 00:23:14,550
it can kill aquatic animals.

251
00:23:23,590 --> 00:23:25,250
I promised Miss Qi

252
00:23:25,550 --> 00:23:27,150
to take her to the Wilderness

253
00:23:27,470 --> 00:23:28,970
to see the Tree of Heaven

254
00:23:29,630 --> 00:23:31,030
and the shores of the sea.

255
00:23:33,990 --> 00:23:35,590
In the boundless azure sea,

256
00:23:37,170 --> 00:23:38,510
there is no path.

257
00:23:41,790 --> 00:23:42,950
Yet

258
00:23:45,070 --> 00:23:46,330
in the mortal world...

259
00:24:04,290 --> 00:24:05,850

[In the boundless azure sea, there is no path. Yet in the mortal world, in the vastness of the starry river, I hold your hand, traveling around the world together.]

I'll take you away.

Where to?

290
00:25:27,770 --> 00:25:29,550
I'll take you to the Wilderness,

291
00:25:29,550 --> 00:25:31,350
although it's a desolate place.

292
00:25:31,410 --> 00:25:32,840
No place

293
00:25:32,950 --> 00:25:34,550
is more desolate than this world.

294
00:25:34,550 --> 00:25:35,270
Master,

295
00:25:35,290 --> 00:25:35,930
bad news!

296
00:25:35,960 --> 00:25:37,220
Miss Qi ran away with the doctor!

297
00:25:37,220 --> 00:25:37,750
This way.

298
00:25:45,140 --> 00:25:46,440
I'm a demon hunter!

299
00:25:46,470 --> 00:25:47,190
Demon!

300
00:25:47,210 --> 00:25:48,640
Show your true form!

301
00:26:33,870 --> 00:26:35,010
My Lady!

302
00:26:36,060 --> 00:26:36,790
I'll marry that man.

303
00:26:36,790 --> 00:26:37,920
I'll marry that man!

304
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:38,470
Father!

305
00:26:38,470 --> 00:26:39,120
Father!

306
00:26:39,310 --> 00:26:40,350
Let him go!

307
00:26:40,350 --> 00:26:41,590
I'll marry that man!

308
00:26:42,230 --> 00:26:43,390
No!

309
00:27:07,490 --> 00:27:09,850
To prevent me from going back to Miss Qi,

310
00:27:10,230 --> 00:27:14,710
he kept the corpse-dissolving and demon-subduing incense burnt in the mansion.

311
00:27:14,710 --> 00:27:16,320
I couldn't save her.

312
00:27:17,790 --> 00:27:19,690
So you ran away, seriously injured

313
00:27:19,690 --> 00:27:21,550
and with little time left to live.

314
00:27:21,630 --> 00:27:22,990
In order to restore your demon power,

315
00:27:22,990 --> 00:27:26,250
you could only absorb malicious energy by killing people.

316
00:27:26,750 --> 00:27:27,980
Also,

317
00:27:28,110 --> 00:27:29,680
you deliberately preyed on brides

318
00:27:29,680 --> 00:27:30,970
and created panic,

319
00:27:31,210 --> 00:27:32,920
making people dare not get married.

320
00:27:32,920 --> 00:27:36,780
You did everything in an attempt to stop Miss Qi from getting married.

321
00:27:37,500 --> 00:27:39,220
I could stop anyone,

322
00:27:39,590 --> 00:27:40,670
but I couldn't stop

323
00:27:40,670 --> 00:27:42,350
her despicable father.

324
00:27:43,430 --> 00:27:45,350
It's God's will that he

325
00:27:46,260 --> 00:27:47,700
ended up like this.

326
00:27:51,060 --> 00:27:51,830
I don't know how

327
00:27:51,830 --> 00:27:53,630
to undo the dream control magic.

328
00:27:54,750 --> 00:27:56,010
And it can't be undone.

329
00:27:59,610 --> 00:28:01,010
It's very easy to undo it.

330
00:28:02,160 --> 00:28:03,200
Cut a piece

331
00:28:03,240 --> 00:28:03,910
of your flesh

332
00:28:03,910 --> 00:28:05,400
and make him eat it.

333
00:28:12,710 --> 00:28:14,260
Don't bother.

334
00:28:14,710 --> 00:28:16,060
I'll wake him up.

335
00:28:25,270 --> 00:28:27,990
Give my life back to me.

336
00:28:29,530 --> 00:28:31,410
It's so cold down here.

337
00:28:31,990 --> 00:28:33,950
Come and accompany me.

338
00:28:35,410 --> 00:28:36,820
Leave me alone.

339
00:28:36,850 --> 00:28:38,860
You should go to that demon.

340
00:28:39,150 --> 00:28:41,360
You helped my daughter elope with him.

341
00:28:41,730 --> 00:28:43,260
You deserved to die!

342
00:28:51,070 --> 00:28:53,880
You do deserve to die!

343
00:28:55,640 --> 00:28:56,560
Wake up.

344
00:29:04,120 --> 00:29:05,660
Don't... Don't kill me!

345
00:29:05,920 --> 00:29:07,650
Don't... Don't come near me!

346
00:29:07,790 --> 00:29:08,820
Neither do you!

347
00:29:09,720 --> 00:29:11,920
Don't... Don't come near me. All of you.

348
00:29:13,180 --> 00:29:14,290
I didn't kill you.

349
00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:15,160
Don't come near me!

350
00:29:15,160 --> 00:29:16,280
Don't come near me!

351
00:29:16,300 --> 00:29:17,290
He's gone crazy.

352
00:29:17,330 --> 00:29:18,040
Go away!

353
00:29:18,060 --> 00:29:19,540
It has nothing to do with me.

354
00:29:19,540 --> 00:29:20,770
I didn't kill you.

355
00:29:20,990 --> 00:29:21,310
I didn't...

356
00:29:21,310 --> 00:29:22,030
Quiet.

357
00:29:26,830 --> 00:29:28,640
It was really him who killed them and buried the bodies.

358
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:29,870
When my Cloud Light Sword

359
00:29:29,870 --> 00:29:31,450
was glimmering in Qi's Mansion,

360
00:29:31,450 --> 00:29:33,850
I felt something was wrong with that place.

361
00:30:09,630 --> 00:30:11,410
It was once a well.

362
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:12,970
He moved a tree there

363
00:30:12,990 --> 00:30:14,450
to cover the well's mouth.

364
00:30:14,900 --> 00:30:16,180
But beneath the tree

365
00:30:16,200 --> 00:30:17,870
lies a hollow, deep well.

366
00:30:18,080 --> 00:30:20,210
The roots couldn't get any nutrients.

367
00:30:20,220 --> 00:30:21,170
As a result,

368
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:22,260
the tree withered.

369
00:30:28,390 --> 00:30:29,310
One.

370
00:30:30,350 --> 00:30:31,280
Two.

371
00:30:32,040 --> 00:30:32,690
Three.

372
00:30:33,390 --> 00:30:34,110
Four.

373
00:30:35,090 --> 00:30:35,960
Five.

374
00:30:37,230 --> 00:30:38,900
All the five bodies in the well

375
00:30:39,320 --> 00:30:40,780
have been pulled out of it.

376
00:30:43,940 --> 00:30:45,390
The people in the well

377
00:30:45,430 --> 00:30:46,230
were the servants

378
00:30:46,230 --> 00:30:48,750
who wanted to help me elope with Miss Qi.

379
00:30:49,620 --> 00:30:50,830
To him, killing them

380
00:30:52,380 --> 00:30:54,430
was like killing a few ants.

381
00:30:57,500 --> 00:30:59,900
They must have died with great resentment.

382
00:31:00,670 --> 00:31:02,640
The greater resentment they died with,

383
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:05,090
the more malicious energy there should be in the courtyard.

384
00:31:05,090 --> 00:31:05,800
But

385
00:31:06,010 --> 00:31:07,140
my Cloud Light Sword

386
00:31:07,170 --> 00:31:09,200
only sensed a faint trace of it.

387
00:31:10,130 --> 00:31:12,320
This has aroused my suspicion.

388
00:31:15,210 --> 00:31:16,060
Someone

389
00:31:16,270 --> 00:31:18,070
absorbed the malicious energy.

390
00:31:24,130 --> 00:31:25,990
Are you suspecting me?

391
00:31:27,120 --> 00:31:28,710
I'm not suspecting you.

392
00:31:29,070 --> 00:31:30,830
I'm sure it was you.

393
00:31:33,370 --> 00:31:34,850
Before you went to the Demon Hunting Bureau

394
00:31:34,850 --> 00:31:36,840
to tell us you would help us catch Ran Yi,

395
00:31:36,840 --> 00:31:38,980
you had already been to Qi's Mansion

396
00:31:39,010 --> 00:31:41,270
and found out Ran Yi committed the crime.

397
00:31:41,520 --> 00:31:42,740
A servant of Qi's Mansion

398
00:31:42,740 --> 00:31:43,510
said that a few days ago,

399
00:31:43,510 --> 00:31:44,740
he saw a ghost

400
00:31:44,740 --> 00:31:46,450
on the tree in the courtyard.

401
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:49,520
Who is it?

402
00:31:50,750 --> 00:31:52,020
Who's there?

403
00:32:02,810 --> 00:32:04,010
Ghost!

404
00:32:05,190 --> 00:32:07,630
That ghost had a pair of red eyes.

405
00:32:07,790 --> 00:32:08,620
I think it was you,

406
00:32:08,620 --> 00:32:09,420
right?

407
00:32:09,960 --> 00:32:11,060
Zhao Yuanzhou.

408
00:32:14,410 --> 00:32:15,400
At that time,

409
00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:17,480
you absorbed the malicious energy in the well

410
00:32:17,480 --> 00:32:19,130
and discovered everything.

411
00:32:19,450 --> 00:32:21,650
Then you started to carry out your plan.

412
00:32:48,280 --> 00:32:49,340
Zhu Yan,

413
00:32:50,030 --> 00:32:52,360
I won't go back to the Wilderness with you.

414
00:32:52,770 --> 00:32:54,640
The Baize Token has been lost.

415
00:32:55,760 --> 00:32:58,150
Why are you being nosy here?

416
00:33:00,260 --> 00:33:03,120
Who said I'm here to take you back to the Wilderness?

417
00:33:04,410 --> 00:33:06,060
I'm here to help you.

418
00:33:07,110 --> 00:33:08,370
You offered

419
00:33:08,400 --> 00:33:11,010
to help him put the Water Ghost's wedding letter

420
00:33:11,010 --> 00:33:12,220
in Qi's Mansion.

421
00:33:13,170 --> 00:33:14,590
You don't need to deny it.

422
00:33:15,660 --> 00:33:16,920
On the wedding letter,

423
00:33:16,930 --> 00:33:18,930
there was familiar demonic energy,

424
00:33:19,180 --> 00:33:21,110
which is annoying.

425
00:33:24,010 --> 00:33:26,610
Mr. Zhuo, I didn't expect you to be so familiar

426
00:33:26,630 --> 00:33:27,990
with my demonic energy.

427
00:33:29,770 --> 00:33:31,830
Indeed, I placed the wedding letter.

428
00:33:57,440 --> 00:33:58,160
[Wedding Letter]

429
00:34:12,449 --> 00:34:14,040
Unexpectedly,

430
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:16,770
Master Qi disregarded familial bonds.

431
00:34:18,719 --> 00:34:20,340
But I'm curious.

432
00:34:20,630 --> 00:34:23,199
Why didn't you take Miss Qi to him directly?

433
00:34:23,219 --> 00:34:25,210
Why did you make such a long detour?

434
00:34:27,370 --> 00:34:29,179
I was too ashamed to see her.

435
00:34:31,870 --> 00:34:33,530
I killed so many people.

436
00:34:34,909 --> 00:34:36,360
I'm guilty.

437
00:34:38,070 --> 00:34:39,739
But she is kind-hearted.

438
00:34:40,440 --> 00:34:42,000
She must care a lot

439
00:34:42,949 --> 00:34:44,630
about what I did.

440
00:34:45,530 --> 00:34:46,230
I just hope

441
00:34:46,230 --> 00:34:47,110
she won't be forced

442
00:34:47,110 --> 00:34:49,219
to marry someone she doesn't like.

443
00:34:53,900 --> 00:34:56,780
I hope she can live the life she wants.

444
00:34:58,320 --> 00:35:00,380
I'll take her here

445
00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:03,220
so that you can elope together.

446
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:05,650
Isn't it good?

447
00:35:09,020 --> 00:35:10,620
I'm a sinful man.

448
00:35:12,120 --> 00:35:14,720
I don't know how to face all the promises I made.

449
00:35:16,330 --> 00:35:17,400
I just hope she

450
00:35:17,730 --> 00:35:19,270
can consider it a dream.

451
00:35:20,930 --> 00:35:22,590
The road is muddy in the dream.

452
00:35:22,890 --> 00:35:24,890
She'll see light after she wakes up.

453
00:35:25,180 --> 00:35:26,790
The world is desolate.

454
00:35:28,330 --> 00:35:29,870
Take care.

455
00:35:40,630 --> 00:35:42,580
You are so affectionate.

456
00:35:45,110 --> 00:35:47,370
You've become more and more like a human.

457
00:35:51,800 --> 00:35:53,420
What about you?

458
00:35:55,680 --> 00:35:57,830
You won't help me for no reason.

459
00:35:59,030 --> 00:36:00,390
What do you want?

460
00:36:05,150 --> 00:36:06,640
Why exactly

461
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:08,720
did you help him?

462
00:36:10,500 --> 00:36:12,330
I told you long ago.

463
00:36:13,320 --> 00:36:14,850
I did it for the Baize Token.

464
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:17,880
The Baize Token?

465
00:36:18,670 --> 00:36:19,710
Some dreams

466
00:36:20,020 --> 00:36:22,500
can remind you of the past that has been forgotten.

467
00:36:22,500 --> 00:36:24,310
Zhao Yuanzhou asked me

468
00:36:24,340 --> 00:36:26,270
to create a dream like that for you.

469
00:36:35,300 --> 00:36:38,260
Is everything I saw in my dream

470
00:36:45,700 --> 00:36:46,820
real?

471
00:36:52,440 --> 00:36:53,580
Yes.

472
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:57,990
So you wanted Ran Yi

473
00:36:58,070 --> 00:36:59,380
to help me remember

474
00:36:59,410 --> 00:37:02,410
the whereabouts of the Baize Token through the dream?

475
00:37:04,560 --> 00:37:06,080
That was not a dream.

476
00:37:07,540 --> 00:37:08,970
It was your memory.

477
00:37:11,330 --> 00:37:13,730
But why was the memory missing from my mind?

478
00:37:26,850 --> 00:37:29,070
What did you see in the dream?

479
00:37:32,470 --> 00:37:33,770
I saw

480
00:37:34,670 --> 00:37:37,460
Master did give the Baize Token to me.

481
00:37:39,030 --> 00:37:42,030
There was indeed a Baize Mark on my forehead.

482
00:37:48,020 --> 00:37:49,110
Then how come

483
00:37:49,130 --> 00:37:51,670
you don't have Baize Divine Power at all?

484
00:37:59,550 --> 00:38:02,610
Maybe there's still something she hasn't remembered.

485
00:38:09,870 --> 00:38:11,040
Zhao Yuanzhou,

486
00:38:11,140 --> 00:38:12,720
I've fulfilled

487
00:38:12,760 --> 00:38:14,080
my promise to you.

488
00:38:14,340 --> 00:38:16,120
What about your promise to me?

489
00:38:19,990 --> 00:38:22,160
Master Qi has been punished.

490
00:38:23,630 --> 00:38:25,160
What about her freedom?

491
00:38:32,640 --> 00:38:33,740
Conjure.

492
00:38:48,910 --> 00:38:50,360
After tomorrow,

493
00:38:50,990 --> 00:38:52,030
everyone will think

494
00:38:52,030 --> 00:38:54,360
Miss Qi has been killed by the Water Ghost.

495
00:38:56,070 --> 00:38:57,110
She's free.

496
00:38:57,940 --> 00:39:00,250
She can go anywhere she wants.

497
00:39:03,040 --> 00:39:04,570
According to the book,

498
00:39:05,190 --> 00:39:06,850
the East Sea in the Wilderness

499
00:39:07,110 --> 00:39:08,840
has azure water and white sand.

500
00:39:12,630 --> 00:39:15,270
I really want to see it myself.

501
00:39:24,310 --> 00:39:25,270
Thank you.

502
00:39:28,520 --> 00:39:29,980
Since you've pled guilty,

503
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:31,790
you should surrender

504
00:39:31,920 --> 00:39:34,520
and go back to the Demon Hunting Bureau with me.

505
00:39:35,640 --> 00:39:36,710
Someone is here.

506
00:40:04,270 --> 00:40:06,270
Didn't we hide her in the Archives?

507
00:40:06,870 --> 00:40:08,270
How did she come here?

508
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:10,090
I didn't expect that

509
00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:11,370
you still came here.

510
00:40:26,140 --> 00:40:27,190
Where's Ran Yi?

511
00:40:34,010 --> 00:40:35,030
Zhuo, you...

512
00:40:36,870 --> 00:40:38,930
It can make sure she won't run around.

513
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:43,120
Let's go.

514
00:41:08,040 --> 00:41:09,680
I know everything.

515
00:41:11,080 --> 00:41:13,010
Whether you're a human or a demon,

516
00:41:13,960 --> 00:41:15,550
no matter what you do,

517
00:41:17,550 --> 00:41:19,150
we'll live and die together,

518
00:41:20,010 --> 00:41:21,390
till death do us part.

519
00:41:45,210 --> 00:41:46,580
Let's leave together

520
00:41:46,830 --> 00:41:48,020
and go back to the Wilderness.

521
00:41:48,020 --> 00:41:48,810
Okay.

522
00:41:50,110 --> 00:41:52,450
You tried so hard to escape.

523
00:41:53,390 --> 00:41:54,840
Why do you want to go back?

524
00:41:57,070 --> 00:41:58,390
People say

525
00:41:59,430 --> 00:42:01,290
animals spend their entire lives

526
00:42:01,560 --> 00:42:04,890
seeking a roof to shelter them in order to eat and sleep well.

527
00:42:05,130 --> 00:42:06,570
But only humans

528
00:42:08,100 --> 00:42:10,370
yearn to return to their hometowns.

529
00:42:15,340 --> 00:42:17,570
I read a lot of books and wrote

530
00:42:18,690 --> 00:42:21,020
many Chinese characters with her before.

531
00:42:21,390 --> 00:42:24,320
But I still didn't understand what homesickness is.

532
00:42:25,610 --> 00:42:26,920
If it's sorrow,

533
00:42:28,360 --> 00:42:30,420
why do so many people pursue it?

534
00:42:32,550 --> 00:42:33,960
Now I understand.

535
00:42:35,160 --> 00:42:36,840
I don't want to be an animal.

536
00:42:37,030 --> 00:42:38,380
I want to be a human.

537
00:42:38,960 --> 00:42:40,870
What about those people you hurt?

538
00:42:42,020 --> 00:42:43,550
They wanted to be humans too.

539
00:42:43,550 --> 00:42:45,720
They also wanted to return to their hometowns.

540
00:42:45,720 --> 00:42:47,320
You committed heinous crimes,

541
00:42:47,320 --> 00:42:49,450
yet you still want to leave unscathed?

542
00:43:01,920 --> 00:43:03,780
Your brother saved me back then.

543
00:43:04,020 --> 00:43:05,820
But today, you want to arrest me.

544
00:43:06,700 --> 00:43:09,350
I've protected you from nightmares for many years.

545
00:43:09,350 --> 00:43:10,670
I did you a favor.

546
00:43:10,700 --> 00:43:12,350
Can't you just let us go?

547
00:43:12,790 --> 00:43:13,990
The one my brother

548
00:43:14,170 --> 00:43:16,520
saved back then was surely a kind demon,

549
00:43:16,540 --> 00:43:18,580
not you who killed innocent people.

550
00:43:18,950 --> 00:43:21,010
I will arrest you.

551
00:43:22,860 --> 00:43:24,700
The only thing I can do

552
00:43:25,250 --> 00:43:27,050
is to plead

553
00:43:28,170 --> 00:43:29,570
for your life.

554
00:43:30,270 --> 00:43:31,040
Yes.

555
00:43:34,710 --> 00:43:36,470
I killed innocent people.

556
00:43:37,860 --> 00:43:40,590
But I created the most beautiful dreams for them.

557
00:43:41,620 --> 00:43:43,280
Their lives

558
00:43:43,360 --> 00:43:45,470
were full of pain and restraints.

559
00:43:46,900 --> 00:43:49,370
I gave them the happiness they longed for.

560
00:43:51,720 --> 00:43:53,110
Longed for.

561
00:43:56,900 --> 00:43:58,780
Words invented by humans

562
00:43:58,980 --> 00:44:01,070
are perfectly apt sometimes.

563
00:44:02,800 --> 00:44:04,260
What is elusive in reality

564
00:44:06,040 --> 00:44:07,520
can be found in dreams.

565
00:44:10,740 --> 00:44:12,230
Life is

566
00:44:12,300 --> 00:44:14,500
like Zhuangzi and his butterfly dream.

567
00:44:14,750 --> 00:44:15,750
In the dreams,

568
00:44:16,070 --> 00:44:17,910
all their wishes came true.

569
00:44:18,630 --> 00:44:20,760
They lived their happy lives in the way

570
00:44:21,010 --> 00:44:22,830
they wanted the most.

571
00:44:24,270 --> 00:44:25,470
Isn't that good?

572
00:44:27,280 --> 00:44:29,080
Whether it's a dream or reality,

573
00:44:29,310 --> 00:44:31,640
it's not for you to decide on their behalf.

574
00:44:33,430 --> 00:44:34,630
I don't want to be a demon.

575
00:44:34,630 --> 00:44:35,710
I want to be a human.

576
00:44:36,100 --> 00:44:37,930
Who should decide it?

577
00:44:38,630 --> 00:44:39,620
You?

578
00:44:40,590 --> 00:44:42,150
Baize Goddess.

579
00:44:45,780 --> 00:44:47,840
Mayflies can see the sun and the moon,

580
00:44:48,210 --> 00:44:50,270
but she can only stay in her room,

581
00:44:50,450 --> 00:44:51,950
bound by the whims of fate.

582
00:44:52,040 --> 00:44:53,750
Who gave her a choice?

583
00:44:54,840 --> 00:44:56,300
Nature is not benevolent.

584
00:44:56,580 --> 00:44:58,630
It treats all things as sacrificial straw dogs.

585
00:44:58,630 --> 00:45:00,760
Just because nature is not benevolent,

586
00:45:00,760 --> 00:45:02,950
justice prevails

587
00:45:03,300 --> 00:45:04,840
beneath the weight of fate.

588
00:45:11,150 --> 00:45:13,610
How will the Demon Hunting Bureau punish me?

589
00:45:14,010 --> 00:45:16,350
Although Master Qi hurt you first,

590
00:45:17,300 --> 00:45:19,670
you killed dozens of people after all.

591
00:45:19,870 --> 00:45:21,130
You are unforgivable.

592
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:24,600
You'll be imprisoned for at least 1,000 years.

593
00:45:24,710 --> 00:45:25,790
1,000 years?

594
00:45:31,070 --> 00:45:33,100
You humans are so arrogant.

595
00:45:33,610 --> 00:45:34,790
For demons,

596
00:45:35,190 --> 00:45:36,400
it's bearable.

597
00:45:37,660 --> 00:45:39,150
But for humans,

598
00:45:41,020 --> 00:45:42,820
life is just a few short decades.

599
00:45:43,230 --> 00:45:44,390
In other words,

600
00:45:44,750 --> 00:45:45,910
I can't see you again

601
00:45:46,990 --> 00:45:48,950
even in the next life.

602
00:46:01,690 --> 00:46:03,270
I refuse to accept that.

603
00:46:04,260 --> 00:46:06,310
It's not up to you.
