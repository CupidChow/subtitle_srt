1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,500
Alright.

2
00:00:02,500 --> 00:00:05,640
Let's get this painting done.

3
00:00:05,640 --> 00:00:09,700
It's starting to look like the gun kurz, wait.

4
00:00:09,700 --> 00:00:11,900
****

5
00:00:13,940 --> 00:00:19,240
ちゃ..

6
00:00:19,240 --> 00:00:21,740
Something коSo...

7
00:00:21,740 --> 00:00:24,500
The new bed is filled with details that aren't coming to mind.

8
00:00:24,500 --> 00:00:27,600
Again...

9
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:02,600
I'm sorry, but I'm not sure if I can get the money back.

10
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:07,600
I'm sorry, but I'm not sure if I can get the money back.

11
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:12,600
I'm sorry, but I'm not sure if I can get the money back.

12
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:17,600
I'm sorry, but I'm not sure if I can get the money back.

13
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:22,600
I'm sorry, but I'm not sure if I can get the money back.

14
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:27,600
I'm sorry, but I'm not sure if I can get the money back.

15
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:32,600
I'm sorry, but I'm not sure if I can get the money back.

16
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:37,600
I'm sorry, but I'm not sure if I can get the money back.

17
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:27,600
I'm sorry, but I'm not sure if I can get the money back.

18
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:29,600
I'm sorry.

19
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:34,600
He just said I saw him and sent him over.

20
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:51,600
I'm sorry, but I'm not sure if I can get the money back.

21
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:53,400
And the Wind came to leave.

22
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:02,580
They must have died already.

23
00:03:05,220 --> 00:03:06,840
This wave has emerged

24
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:09,400
right after the jerk die.

25
00:03:11,180 --> 00:03:13,160
Qie요 Cherishmedi obstacle.

26
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:14,420
Arrest the Luimbests with arson.

27
00:03:15,220 --> 00:03:18,400
He instantly died from the vat.

28
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:19,840
Persevering theận into the nobody...

29
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:21,440
being poisonous,

30
00:03:22,220 --> 00:03:26,860
and the rest is what makes you angry!

31
00:03:33,220 --> 00:03:35,580
If I still can't get through this

32
00:03:35,580 --> 00:03:39,580
it could be your brain..

33
00:03:39,580 --> 00:03:42,360
Uh uh

34
00:03:43,860 --> 00:03:47,960
Oh no

35
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:54,800
Follow me

36
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:56,800
I signed it too.

37
00:03:58,600 --> 00:04:00,600
I signed another one.

38
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:10,280
You've been staring at me.

39
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:12,280
Are you nervous?

40
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:13,780
Did I?

41
00:04:13,780 --> 00:04:15,280
I'm not.

42
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:17,280
Don't talk nonsense.

43
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:20,160
You signed it, right?

44
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:22,160
The contract under the demon blood

45
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:24,160
is weak and weak.

46
00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:26,520
It's not broken.

47
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:41,800
1. Zhao Yuanzhou

48
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:43,800
can't use the white-legged order

49
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:45,800
to do evil things.

50
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:47,800
Can't be a devil.

51
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:49,800
Hide your heart.

52
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:51,800
To harm the living beings.

53
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:54,560
Did you write it all

54
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:56,560
on the top of your head?

55
00:04:57,560 --> 00:04:59,560
How? It's hard to do.

56
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:06,160
2. Zhao Yuanzhou

57
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:08,160
needs to be taught by the sect.

58
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:10,160
Protect the safety of the sect.

59
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:12,160
And I'm willing to

60
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:14,160
keep the relationship

61
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:16,160
of the same kind

62
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:18,160
with him.

63
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:20,160
Remember this.

64
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:22,160
It's the most important one.

65
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:28,160
Which one is the most important?

66
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:30,160
Don't be too short of me.

67
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:32,160
Or keep the relationship of the same kind.

68
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:35,160
No.

69
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:37,160
I'm not forcing you.

70
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:39,160
How can you be in the same condition with me?

71
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:41,160
Forget it.

72
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:44,160
Let's just keep it.

73
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:52,160
2. Zhao Yuanzhou

74
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:54,160
can't use the white-legged order

75
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:56,160
to do evil things.

76
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:58,160
Protect the living beings.

77
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:00,160
Protect the living beings.

78
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:02,160
Protect the living beings.

79
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:04,160
Protect the living beings.

80
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:06,160
Protect the living beings.

81
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:08,160
Protect the living beings.

82
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:10,160
Protect the living beings.

83
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:12,160
Protect the living beings.

84
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:14,160
Protect the living beings.

85
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:16,160
Protect the living beings.

86
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:18,160
Protect the living beings.

87
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:20,160
Protect the living beings.

88
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:22,160
Protect the living beings.

89
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:24,160
Protect the living beings.

90
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:26,160
Protect the living beings.

91
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:28,160
Protect the living beings.

92
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:38,160
Zhao Yuanzhou.

93
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:44,160
No.

94
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:46,160
If you break it,

95
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:50,560
And tampoco km pou yambuchiae kadar,

96
00:06:53,840 --> 00:07:01,760
Why is Sister Zou fixing the expense now?

97
00:07:05,060 --> 00:07:08,600
Planning is also important,

98
00:07:10,760 --> 00:07:14,360
So what should I do?

99
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:21,920
I don't want to hear from you this time.

100
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:25,320
Please, let me swing a motion.

101
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:25,900
Because it's late.

102
00:07:25,900 --> 00:07:29,080
Let'sよろ with your responsibility.

103
00:07:29,080 --> 00:07:31,280
What?

104
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:34,640
Do you want to be a heroine on behalf of your dad?

105
00:07:34,640 --> 00:07:38,280
Please, we'll be right.

106
00:07:42,280 --> 00:07:43,860
I'm joining, too.

107
00:07:43,860 --> 00:07:45,720
I'll be with another woman.

108
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:53,160
I have to die too.

109
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:14,160
Who is it?

110
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:41,920
The

111
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:48,160
You're so heavy, Yu Xin.

112
00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:03,160
No. I'm not good at it.

113
00:09:03,160 --> 00:09:06,160
Smell it. It'll be better.

114
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:18,160
I'm not good at it.

115
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:48,160
What's wrong? Why did it stop?

116
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:19,160
I'm not good at it.

117
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:48,160
It's the water tribe.

118
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:52,160
There are many water tribes.

119
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:56,160
Dragon, fish, turtle, and turtle.

120
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:58,160
Can you search the area a little?

121
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:02,160
It looks ugly.

122
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:04,160
I'll go and look for it.

123
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:06,160
I'll go and look for it.

124
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:08,160
I'll go and look for it.

125
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:10,160
I'll go and look for it.

126
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:12,160
I'll go and look for it.

127
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:14,160
I'll go and look for it.

128
00:11:15,160 --> 00:11:17,160
It looks ugly.

129
00:11:19,160 --> 00:11:21,160
It's really useful.

130
00:11:21,160 --> 00:11:23,160
I feel like I'm helping the big忙.

131
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:28,160
How can the demon be ugly?

132
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:31,160
The demon is ugly.

133
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:34,160
Nonsense.

134
00:11:35,160 --> 00:11:37,160
The demon is magical.

135
00:11:37,160 --> 00:11:39,160
It can draw thousands of faces.

136
00:11:39,160 --> 00:11:42,160
But our gods are different from you.

137
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:44,160
You think it's ugly.

138
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:46,160
You think it's ugly.

139
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:48,160
But in our eyes,

140
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:50,160
it's ugly.

141
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:52,160
It's a big demon.

142
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:54,160
It's ugly.

143
00:12:03,160 --> 00:12:05,160
Keep talking.

144
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:10,160
I'm done.

145
00:12:11,160 --> 00:12:13,160
Master Xiao Zhu.

146
00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:15,160
I'm done.

147
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:18,160
Where did you find the corpse?

148
00:12:19,160 --> 00:12:22,160
The one in the scroll is in the room nearby.

149
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:24,160
Go and have a look.

150
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:30,160
Teacher.

151
00:12:31,160 --> 00:12:33,160
Wu Yan has already taken the corpse

152
00:12:33,160 --> 00:12:35,160
of all the water and ghost cases.

153
00:12:35,160 --> 00:12:37,160
It's all gone.

154
00:12:37,160 --> 00:12:39,160
What?

155
00:12:39,160 --> 00:12:42,160
He didn't leave any clues to the ghost case.

156
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:44,160
After five days,

157
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:47,160
the ghost case was returned to the palace.

158
00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:49,160
The person was killed.

159
00:12:49,160 --> 00:12:52,160
He did this, right?

160
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:55,160
Other people's minds are not important.

161
00:12:55,160 --> 00:12:58,160
I only want Zhao Ren Zhou's head.

162
00:13:09,160 --> 00:13:12,160
The murderer has taken seven lives.

163
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:15,160
The bodies of the seven gods are all found in this lake.

164
00:13:39,160 --> 00:13:41,160
Wu Jiang.

165
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:08,160
This valley must have got rich hunting supplies.

166
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:11,440
But now it seems that the strength is so little

167
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:13,440
that I can't even press the wind.

168
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:17,540
The strength should be absorbed by the killer.

169
00:14:17,540 --> 00:14:21,600
So this demon is specifically to kill people

170
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:25,400
to absorb the strength and increase the strength.

171
00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:28,080
If you just want to kill people and absorb the strength,

172
00:14:29,080 --> 00:14:32,640
why do you have to bring the bride here to run in a hurry?

173
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:35,360
Isn't it weird?

174
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:37,240
It's weird.

175
00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:40,360
The one who ran in the mud is the bride.

176
00:14:40,360 --> 00:14:41,360
As soon as she woke up,

177
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:44,360
the body was lost in the dark.

178
00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:48,760
So I think the bride is her purpose.

179
00:14:48,760 --> 00:14:52,160
Not to kill people, but to kill the bride.

180
00:14:54,680 --> 00:14:56,160
It's so ridiculous.

181
00:14:57,160 --> 00:14:59,160
So what kind of demon is she?

182
00:15:00,760 --> 00:15:02,160
I don't know either.

183
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:04,960
The big demon.

184
00:15:04,960 --> 00:15:05,960
It's so strange.

185
00:15:05,960 --> 00:15:06,960
It's so strange.

186
00:15:06,960 --> 00:15:07,960
It's so strange.

187
00:15:09,960 --> 00:15:10,960
Good.

188
00:15:11,560 --> 00:15:12,560
It's so funny, right?

189
00:15:13,160 --> 00:15:14,960
The big demon is a ten thousand-year-old.

190
00:15:14,960 --> 00:15:17,960
I can do anything for this kind of famous and prudent demon.

191
00:15:17,960 --> 00:15:20,360
I want to know what kind of demon is to kill people.

192
00:15:20,360 --> 00:15:22,960
I just need to find the body of the person who is in the clothes.

193
00:15:24,760 --> 00:15:25,960
I'll know it in a blink of an eye.

194
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:29,360
Let's go.

195
00:15:34,960 --> 00:15:35,960
Let's go.

196
00:15:36,360 --> 00:15:37,960
There's something else to do.

197
00:15:37,960 --> 00:15:39,960
I have to go and handle it.

198
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:43,560
Mr. Zhou,

199
00:15:43,560 --> 00:15:45,560
go and wait for me in the clothes.

200
00:15:45,560 --> 00:15:46,560
Don't be in a hurry.

201
00:15:47,560 --> 00:15:48,960
Are you crazy?

202
00:15:52,960 --> 00:15:53,960
She's in a hurry.

203
00:16:05,960 --> 00:16:06,960
It's raining.

204
00:16:08,960 --> 00:16:09,960
It's snowing.

205
00:16:14,960 --> 00:16:15,960
I'm a doctor.

206
00:16:15,960 --> 00:16:16,960
I'm not a doctor.

207
00:16:17,960 --> 00:16:19,960
I can't do anything about the autopsy.

208
00:16:21,960 --> 00:16:22,960
It's almost there.

209
00:16:22,960 --> 00:16:23,960
Almost?

210
00:16:23,960 --> 00:16:25,960
What's almost there?

211
00:16:25,960 --> 00:16:26,960
Who are you?

212
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:27,960
I can do anything.

213
00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:29,960
I'm a doctor.

214
00:16:29,960 --> 00:16:30,960
I'm a doctor.

215
00:16:30,960 --> 00:16:31,960
I'm a doctor.

216
00:16:31,960 --> 00:16:32,960
I'm a doctor.

217
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:33,960
I'm a doctor.

218
00:16:33,960 --> 00:16:34,960
I'm a doctor.

219
00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:35,960
I'm a doctor.

220
00:16:35,960 --> 00:16:37,960
Can I say that you're like that flower of the peony?

221
00:16:37,960 --> 00:16:38,960
No way.

222
00:16:38,960 --> 00:16:40,960
One and five are divided into two.

223
00:16:40,960 --> 00:16:42,960
The bank is like a mountain.

224
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:44,960
I wish you success.

225
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:45,960
Let's go.

226
00:17:05,960 --> 00:17:07,960
I'm going to find Mr. Zhou's invitation.

227
00:17:09,960 --> 00:17:10,960
Sure.

228
00:17:10,960 --> 00:17:12,960
Wait for the autopsy in five days.

229
00:17:14,960 --> 00:17:15,960
In five days,

230
00:17:15,960 --> 00:17:17,960
I'm going to find Mr. Zhou's invitation.

231
00:17:29,960 --> 00:17:31,960
Why is there no body here?

232
00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:36,960
It's Chong Wuyin's men.

233
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:43,960
It was done by Chong Wuyin.

234
00:17:43,960 --> 00:17:45,960
They removed all the bodies in advance.

235
00:17:45,960 --> 00:17:47,960
They destroyed the face of the body

236
00:17:47,960 --> 00:17:49,960
to prevent us from investigating.

237
00:17:49,960 --> 00:17:51,960
Then Chong Wuyin is so good.

238
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:56,960
Chong Wuyin is not a good thing.

239
00:17:57,960 --> 00:17:58,960
Where is Xiao Chu?

240
00:17:59,960 --> 00:18:01,960
He's looking for the next dangerous bride.

241
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:04,960
The bride who's about to get married.

242
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:08,960
I said, this old man is too cruel.

243
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:10,960
Yes, but I've already done that.

244
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:13,960
Let's make sure that the lady is ready to be married in five days.

245
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:14,960
Yes.

246
00:18:17,960 --> 00:18:18,960
Move the things in.

247
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:20,960
Don't talk about it.

248
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:22,960
Are you guys the same as Mr. Ye?

249
00:18:23,960 --> 00:18:24,960
Mr. Fang,

250
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:26,960
do we have to give Mr. Dan some advice?

251
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:28,960
Let them go down safely.

252
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:29,960
Don't bother us.

253
00:18:29,960 --> 00:18:31,960
Tong said that you're just a fool.

254
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:34,960
But I really can't go down.

255
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:35,960
Yes.

256
00:18:35,960 --> 00:18:36,960
Move in.

257
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:37,960
This is the knife.

258
00:19:07,960 --> 00:19:08,960
Let's go.

259
00:19:13,960 --> 00:19:14,960
Why are you looking at me?

260
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:16,960
What are you guys thinking about?

261
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:19,960
I'm telling you.

262
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:21,960
I'm leaving.

263
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:37,960
Wu An.

264
00:19:57,960 --> 00:19:59,960
Are you okay?

265
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:01,960
I'm fine.

266
00:20:03,960 --> 00:20:05,960
But they didn't tell me anything.

267
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:07,960
Are you okay?

268
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:26,960
Why do you still have a wound?

269
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:28,960
Can't you heal yourself?

270
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:32,960
It's the main antidote for the insect.

271
00:20:33,960 --> 00:20:36,960
It's the poison that's really poison to the demon.

272
00:20:43,960 --> 00:20:45,960
It will make the wound unable to heal.

273
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:47,960
It will make it weak.

274
00:20:49,960 --> 00:20:50,960
I can't heal.

275
00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:52,960
I can!

276
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:57,960
The Spring Martial Art has destroyed all the bodies.

277
00:20:57,960 --> 00:20:59,960
Fortunately, I'm a great god.

278
00:20:59,960 --> 00:21:02,960
They took a precious body from them.

279
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:07,960
Lord Bingo.

280
00:21:07,960 --> 00:21:11,960
The first team of the G14 has gone to the underground and the Yizhou.

281
00:21:11,960 --> 00:21:15,960
They took a body of the victim from the Spring Martial Art.

282
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:17,960
A bunch of scum.

283
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:19,960
Push it.

284
00:21:19,960 --> 00:21:20,960
Yes.

285
00:21:23,960 --> 00:21:26,960
I heard that a month ago,

286
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:29,960
you had a serious problem with the monster.

287
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:31,960
Is there anything wrong?

288
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:37,960
I can't see it.

289
00:21:43,960 --> 00:21:45,960
Look at the face of the bride.

290
00:21:45,960 --> 00:21:47,960
It looks like she was scared to death.

291
00:21:47,960 --> 00:21:49,960
How can she scare the monster to death?

292
00:21:49,960 --> 00:21:51,960
She's so scary.

293
00:21:57,960 --> 00:21:58,960
What's this?

294
00:21:59,960 --> 00:22:00,960
The dead body is holding it.

295
00:22:01,960 --> 00:22:04,960
It looks like a demon's body.

296
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:19,960
So this is the one that the dead body ran out.

297
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:21,960
It's a broken case.

298
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:23,960
I'm a little hungry.

299
00:22:23,960 --> 00:22:24,960
I'll eat it and talk.

300
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:41,960
Here comes the soup.

301
00:22:45,960 --> 00:22:46,960
I'm hungry.

302
00:22:47,960 --> 00:22:48,960
You're too much.

303
00:22:49,960 --> 00:22:51,960
Take me as a master of the Tian Du Binyin.

304
00:22:51,960 --> 00:22:52,960
Take me to the laboratory.

305
00:22:53,960 --> 00:22:54,960
It's so disgusting.

306
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:56,960
After watching it, I can't finish it in three days.

307
00:22:56,960 --> 00:22:57,960
Boss,

308
00:22:57,960 --> 00:22:58,960
I'll have a bowl of pot and soup.

309
00:22:58,960 --> 00:22:59,960
Six pancakes and a little meat.

310
00:22:59,960 --> 00:23:01,960
I'll have a spicy and vinegar.

311
00:23:01,960 --> 00:23:02,960
Okay.

312
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:07,960
Here, wine.

313
00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:10,960
Thank you.

314
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:17,960
Sister Pei,

315
00:23:17,960 --> 00:23:18,960
you treat me so well.

316
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:21,960
Are you going to teach me something terrible again?

317
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:26,960
Xiao Bai is brainless.

318
00:23:31,960 --> 00:23:32,960
Anyway, you don't eat it.

319
00:23:33,960 --> 00:23:35,960
Tell me about the demon first.

320
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:38,960
The dead body has no wounds,

321
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:39,960
but the face is still clear.

322
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:41,960
They were scared to death.

323
00:23:41,960 --> 00:23:42,960
In our world,

324
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:45,960
it's not a small number of medicines that can scare people to death.

325
00:23:45,960 --> 00:23:46,960
We don't know what it is.

326
00:23:47,960 --> 00:23:48,960
It's called the dye.

327
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:52,960
I can't believe I'm so direct.

328
00:23:53,960 --> 00:23:55,960
Ha ha ha ha ha.

329
00:23:56,960 --> 00:23:57,960
Dye.

330
00:23:59,960 --> 00:24:00,960
Dye.

331
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:03,960
Dye.

332
00:24:03,960 --> 00:24:06,960
It's a legendary medicine that has been eaten by K-dye.

333
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:07,960
Dye.

334
00:24:07,960 --> 00:24:09,960
It's a medicine that has a dream.

335
00:24:09,960 --> 00:24:11,960
It has a dream of having a dream.

336
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:14,960
It can really make people fall asleep.

337
00:24:15,960 --> 00:24:16,960
Can dream?

338
00:24:17,960 --> 00:24:19,960
But can I

339
00:24:19,960 --> 00:24:20,960
be a doctor's dream every day?

340
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:21,960
Don't wake up.

341
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:24,960
Every dream is a guide to our wish.

342
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:26,960
Although it's good,

343
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:27,960
it's a month in the lake.

344
00:24:27,960 --> 00:24:29,960
It's a success.

345
00:24:29,960 --> 00:24:31,960
A dust can't be done.

346
00:24:33,960 --> 00:24:34,960
Okay.

347
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:36,960
But in this world,

348
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:38,960
most people are loyal to each other.

349
00:24:39,960 --> 00:24:41,960
They can't catch up to the moon.

350
00:24:41,960 --> 00:24:43,960
For them,

351
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:47,960
the moon in the water is very important.

352
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:51,960
It's enough to have a lie.

353
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:54,960
But some people

354
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:56,960
can never dream.

355
00:24:57,960 --> 00:24:59,960
They are real brothers.

356
00:24:59,960 --> 00:25:00,960
They are real.

357
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:01,960
For example,

358
00:25:01,960 --> 00:25:02,960
Mr. Xiao Zhuo.

359
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:05,960
He never speaks nonsense.

360
00:25:05,960 --> 00:25:06,960
He speaks out of nowhere.

361
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:07,960
Okay.

362
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:10,960
Other than your eyes,

363
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:11,960
no one else is here.

364
00:25:15,960 --> 00:25:16,960
But Xiao Zhuo

365
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:18,960
never dreams.

366
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:21,960
That's good.

367
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:24,960
I've never heard of

368
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:25,960
someone who doesn't dream.

369
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:28,960
Everyone wants to avoid it.

370
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:30,960
Every night,

371
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:32,960
secretly hide in the dream.

372
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:35,960
Travelling is the most common thing.

373
00:25:37,960 --> 00:25:39,960
I don't dare to sleep.

374
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:42,960
I don't dare to dream.

375
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:44,960
When I sleep,

376
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:46,960
I dream of myself

377
00:25:47,960 --> 00:25:49,960
becoming a monster.

378
00:25:51,960 --> 00:25:53,960
So the most common thing

379
00:25:53,960 --> 00:25:55,960
is to make people

380
00:25:55,960 --> 00:25:57,960
in their dreams

381
00:25:57,960 --> 00:25:58,960
scared to death.

382
00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:00,960
So the dream

383
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:02,960
makes people

384
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:03,960
dream.

385
00:26:03,960 --> 00:26:05,960
But not dream.

386
00:26:07,960 --> 00:26:09,960
Then I remember it wrongly.

387
00:26:13,960 --> 00:26:15,960
How can I deal with the doubt?

388
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:19,960
Either you have someone who can change the world,

389
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:23,960
or you can cut

390
00:26:23,960 --> 00:26:25,960
a piece of meat from it.

391
00:26:29,960 --> 00:26:32,960
It's better to live than to live.

392
00:26:33,960 --> 00:26:36,960
You're so annoying, Zhao Yanzhou.

393
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:41,960
By the way,

394
00:26:41,960 --> 00:26:43,960
what did you say about the broken needle?

395
00:26:43,960 --> 00:26:45,960
I've never read it in the book.

396
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:48,960
It's something that the Great Empress

397
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:51,960
has to use.

398
00:26:51,960 --> 00:26:52,960
Don't care about it.

399
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:53,960
Take the case.

400
00:26:53,960 --> 00:26:54,960
Master.

401
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:57,960
Miss's wedding dress is ready.

402
00:27:01,960 --> 00:27:03,960
Let's hurry up.

403
00:27:03,960 --> 00:27:05,960
Don't delay the wedding.

404
00:27:05,960 --> 00:27:07,960
But Master,

405
00:27:07,960 --> 00:27:09,960
if the ghost comes to rob the bride,

406
00:27:09,960 --> 00:27:10,960
Miss...

407
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:12,960
I've spent so much money on her.

408
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:14,960
She's a good girl.

409
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:16,960
She's a good girl.

410
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:18,960
I'm sorry.

411
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:19,960
I'm sorry.

412
00:27:19,960 --> 00:27:20,960
I'm sorry.

413
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:21,960
I'm sorry.

414
00:27:21,960 --> 00:27:22,960
She's unique.

415
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:24,960
She's been hostility without any hesitation.

416
00:27:25,960 --> 00:27:26,960
Even if she dies,

417
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:29,960
she needs to die on the way for a lower price.

418
00:27:29,960 --> 00:27:30,960
As long as the足不到我的钱

419
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:33,960
takes sixty thousand of my family's wealth from the food market,

420
00:27:33,960 --> 00:27:35,960
we need it as an extra.

421
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:38,960
We need to remain loyal

422
00:27:39,960 --> 00:27:41,960
to get all those times

423
00:27:41,960 --> 00:27:44,960
that Lord theoretically likes.

424
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:46,960
I agree, Master.

425
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:47,960
This is enough to the...

426
00:27:51,960 --> 00:27:56,960
I'm sorry, but I'm not sure if I can get the key.

427
00:27:56,960 --> 00:28:01,960
I'm sorry, but I'm not sure if I can get the key.

428
00:28:01,960 --> 00:28:06,960
I'm sorry, but I'm not sure if I can get the key.

429
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:11,960
I'm sorry, but I'm not sure if I can get the key.

430
00:28:11,960 --> 00:28:16,960
I'm sorry, but I'm not sure if I can get the key.

431
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:20,960
Coming soon.

432
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:26,960
Coming soon.

433
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:35,320
Since you knew about the personalities...

434
00:28:35,320 --> 00:28:37,480
then let's drag her out quicker.

435
00:28:37,480 --> 00:28:39,480
We've found a personal昨 PDF for her.

436
00:28:39,480 --> 00:28:42,060
And we're still trying to fool her.

437
00:28:42,060 --> 00:28:43,960
I have no idea where she's at?

438
00:28:43,960 --> 00:28:45,000
How do you catch it?

439
00:28:45,520 --> 00:28:46,560
For a year?

440
00:28:47,720 --> 00:28:49,040
You all bite.

441
00:28:49,280 --> 00:28:50,760
Can't you catch the bad breath?

442
00:28:51,040 --> 00:28:52,800
Catching bad breath is like a dog.

443
00:28:52,800 --> 00:28:53,760
You're so impulsive.

444
00:28:54,320 --> 00:28:55,600
Even a dog is not as good as a dog.

445
00:28:57,640 --> 00:29:00,000
You said you were looking for my brother.

446
00:29:00,560 --> 00:29:02,600
You must be a fool.

447
00:29:05,960 --> 00:29:06,920
Master Xiao Chu.

448
00:29:10,360 --> 00:29:12,000
I know how to find the cause.

449
00:29:12,440 --> 00:29:13,960
Someone from the dog is coming.

450
00:29:18,160 --> 00:29:20,160
Miss Qi will leave the house in five days.

451
00:29:20,760 --> 00:29:22,120
The wedding is not yet over.

452
00:29:22,120 --> 00:29:24,920
We'll have to wait for her.

453
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:29,800
What's the matter with Master Qi?

454
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:31,600
He's not getting married yet.

455
00:29:31,800 --> 00:29:33,600
Is he going to keep it for the money?

456
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:36,440
Master Zhuo.

457
00:29:36,800 --> 00:29:38,560
Did you find something else?

458
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:46,000
Qi Fu is eating a strange smell.

459
00:29:49,400 --> 00:29:50,400
Strange?

460
00:29:52,600 --> 00:29:56,000
There's a magic spell in the yard.

461
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:02,600
Eight years.

462
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:06,400
Zhao Yanzhou.

463
00:30:07,400 --> 00:30:11,400
Do you still remember the day you left home?

464
00:30:12,400 --> 00:30:16,000
You've given so many new friends.

465
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:20,400
Which one should I kill?

466
00:30:29,400 --> 00:30:31,400
According to the old rules,

467
00:30:31,400 --> 00:30:36,400
let's start with the white one first.

468
00:31:31,800 --> 00:31:32,800
This year…

469
00:31:35,800 --> 00:31:38,400
hope you find the ours.

470
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:40,480
vamos ver.

471
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:42,200
k Lagfirman

472
00:31:45,300 --> 00:31:47,200
Community or underground

473
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:48,600
Energy

474
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:54,400
How many years does this healthcare skin have?

475
00:31:57,800 --> 00:31:59,000
way more than ten years

476
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:01,200
one's damaged

477
00:32:01,400 --> 00:32:09,320
The

478
00:32:11,100 --> 00:32:17,140
Conf advances

479
00:32:21,780 --> 00:32:22,960
The God rules

480
00:32:24,380 --> 00:32:25,100
Without you

481
00:32:26,540 --> 00:32:26,900
Old man

482
00:32:26,900 --> 00:32:27,520
Even a

483
00:32:27,520 --> 00:32:28,740
Finally

484
00:32:29,580 --> 00:32:31,300
I'll achieve the

485
00:32:31,400 --> 00:32:36,400
The first time I saw a giant giant, I was surprised.

486
00:32:36,400 --> 00:32:41,400
I was surprised that it was a giant.

487
00:32:41,400 --> 00:32:46,400
I was surprised that it was a giant.

488
00:32:46,400 --> 00:32:51,400
I was surprised that it was a giant.

489
00:32:51,400 --> 00:32:56,400
I was surprised that it was a giant.

490
00:32:57,400 --> 00:33:00,400
You're right.

491
00:33:00,400 --> 00:33:06,400
Purple and red are handsome lovers on the other hand.

492
00:33:06,400 --> 00:33:12,400
It is true that I succeeded in autofiguring the belt to the presente family

493
00:33:12,400 --> 00:33:17,400
and offered a reason not to say so.

494
00:33:17,400 --> 00:33:22,400
I'd rather not have change my gender recruiting needs.

495
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:24,400
I can't keep you.

496
00:33:27,400 --> 00:33:30,400
But other monsters are like the evil monster.

497
00:33:31,400 --> 00:33:33,400
It's not easy.

498
00:33:52,400 --> 00:34:04,400
Even if it's a fish, it needs medicine.

499
00:34:04,400 --> 00:34:24,400
To get this medicine for you, I have to pretend to be hurt by the evil monster.

500
00:34:26,400 --> 00:34:28,400
Why do you still have a wound?

501
00:34:28,400 --> 00:34:31,400
It's really the face of the evil monster.

502
00:34:34,400 --> 00:34:38,400
When will you do what you promised me?

503
00:34:42,400 --> 00:34:44,400
Don't worry.

504
00:34:47,400 --> 00:34:49,400
Soon.

505
00:34:50,400 --> 00:34:53,400
Master, there are some evil monsters asking for an audience.

506
00:34:55,400 --> 00:34:57,400
They are coming soon.

507
00:34:57,400 --> 00:34:59,400
I don't know what to do.

508
00:34:59,400 --> 00:35:00,400
I understand.

509
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:02,400
I'll go to the bank.

510
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:05,400
Send General Da for me to go from the back door.

511
00:35:05,400 --> 00:35:08,400
Dai Lu, please.

512
00:35:17,400 --> 00:35:19,400
Listen.

513
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:34,400
Dai Lu.

514
00:35:35,400 --> 00:35:37,400
I'm coming.

515
00:36:03,400 --> 00:36:08,400
Master, this is the wedding invitation of the evil monster.

516
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:11,400
I don't know what to see.

517
00:36:11,400 --> 00:36:13,400
Wedding invitation?

518
00:36:25,400 --> 00:36:27,400
Where is Miss Ji?

519
00:36:27,400 --> 00:36:29,400
Miss Ji, she...

520
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:33,400
My daughter is too ill-tempered and has a cold.

521
00:36:33,400 --> 00:36:35,400
She has been sick for a few days.

522
00:36:35,400 --> 00:36:37,400
It's not convenient to see her.

523
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:50,400
There is a demon.

524
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:52,400
It's the evil monster.

525
00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:55,400
The wedding invitation is very important.

526
00:36:55,400 --> 00:37:01,400
Do you dare ask Charles if master is evil and should stop?

527
00:37:01,400 --> 00:37:03,400
Yes.

528
00:37:03,400 --> 00:37:06,400
Now I'm un Say it.

529
00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:07,400
I can only turn on the fire.

530
00:37:07,400 --> 00:37:09,400
I'm used to that.

531
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:12,400
Before the wedding invitation was announced,

532
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:14,400
the 110th bottle is idle.

533
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:16,400
It's not special.

534
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:18,400
I want a photo.

535
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:21,400
Charles.

536
00:37:21,400 --> 00:37:24,400
If you really like my daughter,

537
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:27,760
Then you must be carefree and not hide anything from us.

538
00:37:27,760 --> 00:37:29,760
Of course.

539
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:33,520
Please save my daughter, Master.

540
00:37:43,120 --> 00:37:46,160
Master Qi, there is a problem.

541
00:37:46,160 --> 00:37:50,520
The case report has never been mentioned before.

542
00:37:50,520 --> 00:37:54,120
Yes. Only Miss Qi has received it.

543
00:37:54,160 --> 00:37:59,280
It seems that Miss Qi is the key to this case.

544
00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:01,880
But we can't see her.

545
00:38:06,160 --> 00:38:08,480
You guys are so unlucky.

546
00:38:08,480 --> 00:38:10,840
Miss Qi was married and had a happy time.

547
00:38:10,840 --> 00:38:12,800
She was so hopeless.

548
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:13,640
Isn't that so?

549
00:38:13,640 --> 00:38:15,760
In a month, she was so lucky.

550
00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:17,880
I don't know what happened.

551
00:38:17,880 --> 00:38:20,200
A month?

552
00:38:20,200 --> 00:38:22,320
What happened before?

553
00:38:22,880 --> 00:38:26,000
Nothing. I don't know anything.

554
00:38:28,560 --> 00:38:31,400
I really don't know.

555
00:38:31,400 --> 00:38:33,800
You have a bad temper.

556
00:38:33,800 --> 00:38:35,960
You shouldn't be upset.

557
00:38:36,760 --> 00:38:39,720
I really don't know.

558
00:38:39,720 --> 00:38:41,600
Say it.

559
00:38:41,600 --> 00:38:46,880
I just know that Master was looking for a reason to find the worm.

560
00:38:46,880 --> 00:38:48,760
We didn't tell him.

561
00:38:48,760 --> 00:38:52,000
It's because I really don't know.

562
00:38:52,040 --> 00:38:52,840
Anything else?

563
00:38:52,840 --> 00:38:56,200
No. I just know so much.

564
00:38:56,200 --> 00:39:01,440
Master Qi was looking for the worm a month ago.

565
00:39:01,440 --> 00:39:04,600
But the wedding invitation was just sent.

566
00:39:07,040 --> 00:39:10,680
Do you know where the worm is?

567
00:39:10,680 --> 00:39:13,320
I know.

568
00:39:22,080 --> 00:39:28,540
algum

569
00:39:30,880 --> 00:39:32,120
Angryisted Master.

570
00:39:32,120 --> 00:39:33,960
According to your destinations,

571
00:39:33,960 --> 00:39:35,620
he listened to all the information about the drug Woofers

572
00:39:35,620 --> 00:39:38,800
one month ago.

573
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:40,720
Did you聲 Upper Biomeестно Detikut?

574
00:39:40,720 --> 00:39:41,920
Where is the illegal substance effective?

575
00:39:41,920 --> 00:39:44,200
Just in case,

576
00:39:44,200 --> 00:39:45,600
they have already started.

577
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:54,000
I have to dont integration with anyone

578
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:55,580
there is no other way

579
00:39:55,580 --> 00:39:57,580
Why didn't you give me the task?

580
00:39:57,580 --> 00:39:59,580
Of course I did.

581
00:39:59,580 --> 00:40:03,580
Your task is to stay away from the battlefield and not to be confused.

582
00:40:03,580 --> 00:40:05,580
Why didn't you go to catch people?

583
00:40:05,580 --> 00:40:08,580
You only know how to tell the truth about Xiao Zhu's brother and sister Pei.

584
00:40:08,580 --> 00:40:10,580
You're so kind.

585
00:40:10,580 --> 00:40:13,580
Why are you so mean to your sister Wen Xiao?

586
00:40:14,580 --> 00:40:16,580
This...

587
00:40:18,580 --> 00:40:21,580
Sister Wen, she's picking on you.

588
00:40:21,580 --> 00:40:23,580
What's she doing?

589
00:40:23,580 --> 00:40:26,580
She's picking on you. What are you doing?

590
00:40:27,580 --> 00:40:30,580
We're not waiting here for the suspect.

591
00:40:30,580 --> 00:40:34,580
If the other party wants to escape, this is their way of escape.

592
00:40:34,580 --> 00:40:37,580
We'll just wait here for the thief.

593
00:40:38,580 --> 00:40:40,580
Huh.

594
00:40:51,580 --> 00:40:56,580
Your big yellow demon only drinks water, doesn't eat anything?

595
00:40:56,580 --> 00:40:59,580
Even water can be used.

596
00:40:59,580 --> 00:41:02,580
I'll go get some water.

597
00:41:06,580 --> 00:41:08,580
It's so good to have a good life.

598
00:41:08,580 --> 00:41:11,580
Then you want to have one?

599
00:41:11,580 --> 00:41:14,580
I've been a little boy. I want to die.

600
00:41:14,580 --> 00:41:17,580
Then I can't bear to live.

601
00:41:22,580 --> 00:41:27,580
Since you don't drink water, why do you always carry this water?

602
00:41:29,580 --> 00:41:32,580
It's also a special way of using it.

603
00:41:34,580 --> 00:41:38,580
Zhan Ren Zhou, I've been suspecting you of drinking water for a long time.

604
00:41:38,580 --> 00:41:41,580
But I have no evidence.

605
00:41:41,580 --> 00:41:43,580
It's true that it's water.

606
00:41:43,580 --> 00:41:45,580
It's just a hobby.

607
00:41:45,580 --> 00:41:48,580
It's just like some plants like to sunbathe.

608
00:41:48,580 --> 00:41:50,580
What kind of water is that?

609
00:41:50,580 --> 00:41:52,580
It's...

610
00:41:52,580 --> 00:41:54,580
You want to talk to me?

611
00:41:54,580 --> 00:41:58,580
As a colleague, I just want to add to your understanding.

612
00:41:58,580 --> 00:42:00,580
I suggest you not to know me.

613
00:42:00,580 --> 00:42:02,580
Why?

614
00:42:02,580 --> 00:42:07,580
Because the more you know me, the more...

615
00:42:07,580 --> 00:42:09,580
Don't...

616
00:42:09,580 --> 00:42:11,580
Hurry up!

617
00:42:11,580 --> 00:42:13,580
Hurry up!

618
00:42:22,580 --> 00:42:25,580
If you want to save me,

619
00:42:26,580 --> 00:42:28,580
you can come with me.

620
00:42:30,580 --> 00:42:32,580
Wen Xing Zi Xian!

621
00:42:32,580 --> 00:42:34,580
How nice!

622
00:42:55,580 --> 00:42:57,580
What are you doing here?

623
00:43:01,580 --> 00:43:03,580
I'm not coming. He's going to run away.

624
00:43:03,580 --> 00:43:05,580
Do you think I'll let him run away?

625
00:43:05,580 --> 00:43:07,580
Look at him.

626
00:43:07,580 --> 00:43:09,580
Liu Huo Kou!

627
00:43:09,580 --> 00:43:11,580
What are you doing here?

628
00:43:11,580 --> 00:43:13,580
I'm not coming. He's going to run away.

629
00:43:13,580 --> 00:43:15,580
Do you think I'll let him run away?

630
00:43:15,580 --> 00:43:17,580
Look at him.

631
00:43:17,580 --> 00:43:19,580
Liu Huo Kou!

632
00:43:19,580 --> 00:43:21,580
Liu Huo Kou!

633
00:43:50,580 --> 00:43:53,580
Li Lun.

634
00:43:53,580 --> 00:43:56,580
You're playing the game again?

635
00:43:56,580 --> 00:43:59,580
I'm not used to playing the game.

636
00:43:59,580 --> 00:44:01,580
Li Lun.

637
00:44:05,580 --> 00:44:08,580
He's the one who killed master.

638
00:44:20,580 --> 00:44:22,580
Li Lun, do you know what you're doing?

639
00:44:22,580 --> 00:44:24,580
Zhao Wen Er.

640
00:44:24,580 --> 00:44:27,580
You're just a mortal.

641
00:44:27,580 --> 00:44:30,580
Why are you doing this to me?

642
00:44:30,580 --> 00:44:33,580
I'm a white-haired bloodline.

643
00:44:33,580 --> 00:44:35,580
I'm a white-haired bloodline.

644
00:44:35,580 --> 00:44:37,580
Of course I have to do this.

645
00:44:37,580 --> 00:44:39,580
Then I'll kill you.

646
00:44:39,580 --> 00:44:42,580
I'll see how you do it.

647
00:44:42,580 --> 00:44:44,580
Master!

648
00:44:50,580 --> 00:44:52,580
Master!

649
00:44:56,580 --> 00:44:58,580
Master!

650
00:44:59,580 --> 00:45:01,580
Master!

651
00:45:20,580 --> 00:45:23,580
He seems to be thinking.

652
00:45:23,580 --> 00:45:25,580
Why don't we...

653
00:45:25,580 --> 00:45:28,580
help him?

654
00:45:49,580 --> 00:45:51,580
Master!

655
00:46:14,580 --> 00:46:16,580
Wen Xiao!

656
00:46:19,580 --> 00:46:21,580
How was it?

657
00:46:21,580 --> 00:46:24,580
Did you remember it?

658
00:46:49,580 --> 00:46:51,580
I'm sorry.

659
00:46:51,580 --> 00:46:53,580
