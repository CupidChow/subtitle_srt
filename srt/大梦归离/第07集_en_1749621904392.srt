1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:14,780
You would get back at her if the

2
00:00:14,780 --> 00:00:19,780
I'm sorry, but I'm not sure if I can get the key to the room.

3
00:00:19,780 --> 00:00:24,780
I'm sorry, but I'm not sure if I can get the key to the room.

4
00:00:24,780 --> 00:00:29,780
I'm sorry, but I'm not sure if I can get the key to the room.

5
00:00:29,780 --> 00:00:34,780
I'm sorry, but I'm not sure if I can get the key to the room.

6
00:00:34,780 --> 00:00:39,780
I'm sorry, but I'm not sure if I can get the key to the room.

7
00:00:39,780 --> 00:00:44,780
I'm sorry, but I'm not sure if I can get the key to the room.

8
00:00:44,780 --> 00:00:49,780
I'm sorry, but I'm not sure if I can get the key to the room.

9
00:00:49,780 --> 00:00:54,780
I'm sorry, but I'm not sure if I can get the key to the room.

10
00:00:54,780 --> 00:00:59,780
I'm sorry, but I'm not sure if I can get the key to the room.

11
00:00:59,780 --> 00:01:04,780
I'm sorry, but I'm not sure if I can get the key to the room.

12
00:01:04,780 --> 00:01:09,780
I'm sorry, but I'm not sure if I can get the key to the room.

13
00:01:09,780 --> 00:01:14,780
I'm sorry, but I'm not sure if I can get the key to the room.

14
00:01:14,780 --> 00:01:19,780
I'm sorry, but I'm not sure if I can get the key to the room.

15
00:01:19,780 --> 00:01:24,780
I'm sorry, but I'm not sure if I can get the key to the room.

16
00:01:24,780 --> 00:01:29,780
I'm sorry, but I'm not sure if I can get the key to the room.

17
00:01:29,780 --> 00:01:34,780
I'm sorry, but I'm not sure if I can get the key to the room.

18
00:01:34,780 --> 00:01:39,780
I'm sorry, but I'm not sure if I can get the key to the room.

19
00:01:59,780 --> 00:02:02,780
The dream of 1999 is very soft and sweet.

20
00:02:02,780 --> 00:02:05,780
Please take a look at the dream.

21
00:02:12,780 --> 00:02:14,780
I have a question for you.

22
00:02:14,780 --> 00:02:18,780
I don't know if you can answer it.

23
00:02:20,780 --> 00:02:22,780
I won't ask.

24
00:02:24,780 --> 00:02:26,780
Go ahead.

25
00:02:30,780 --> 00:02:33,780
I'm begging you.

26
00:02:39,780 --> 00:02:42,780
The smell of the smell is so strong.

27
00:02:42,780 --> 00:02:45,780
Maybe it's because you still don't know the answer.

28
00:02:46,780 --> 00:02:49,780
You're so slow to go back to your father's life before we were 50.

29
00:02:49,780 --> 00:02:50,780
You two are so slow.

30
00:02:50,780 --> 00:02:51,780
You don't want to think about it.

31
00:02:52,780 --> 00:02:54,780
What's important is...

32
00:02:59,780 --> 00:03:01,780
Xiaoqiu.

33
00:03:05,780 --> 00:03:07,780
You two are so scary.

34
00:03:07,780 --> 00:03:09,780
You scared me. I've been waiting for you in the Jiao Temple.

35
00:03:09,780 --> 00:03:11,780
They said you didn't come back to your father's life before noon.

36
00:03:11,780 --> 00:03:12,780
Everyone has a head-on.

37
00:03:12,780 --> 00:03:14,780
I'm worried that you two will run away if you leave me.

38
00:03:14,780 --> 00:03:16,780
I'm the only one in the Jiao Temple who will die.

39
00:03:16,780 --> 00:03:18,780
So I'm going to go out and win you.

40
00:03:18,780 --> 00:03:20,780
I'll go to the temple and the temple after the break.

41
00:03:20,780 --> 00:03:22,780
There's a...

42
00:03:30,780 --> 00:03:32,780
Go in and have a look.

43
00:03:33,780 --> 00:03:35,780
Let's go.

44
00:03:38,780 --> 00:03:40,780
This...

45
00:03:41,780 --> 00:03:43,780
This...

46
00:03:57,780 --> 00:03:59,780
Where is the monster?

47
00:04:10,780 --> 00:04:12,780
Where is it?

48
00:04:30,780 --> 00:04:32,780
Xiaoqiu.

49
00:04:41,780 --> 00:04:42,780
There's no monster.

50
00:04:42,780 --> 00:04:44,780
There is definitely one.

51
00:04:44,780 --> 00:04:46,780
There's definitely one here.

52
00:04:46,780 --> 00:04:48,780
There's no monster.

53
00:04:48,780 --> 00:04:50,780
There is.

54
00:04:51,780 --> 00:04:53,780
Such a big one.

55
00:04:54,780 --> 00:04:56,780
It's not funny.

56
00:05:11,780 --> 00:05:13,780
Why hasn't he come back yet?

57
00:05:13,780 --> 00:05:15,780
Did something happen?

58
00:05:18,780 --> 00:05:20,780
If he doesn't come back,

59
00:05:20,780 --> 00:05:22,780
something really is going to happen.

60
00:05:41,780 --> 00:05:44,780
There's still one quarter of the time left.

61
00:05:44,780 --> 00:05:46,780
The Jiao Temple...

62
00:05:46,780 --> 00:05:49,780
either gives out the secret door...

63
00:05:50,780 --> 00:05:54,780
or gives out the way to kill someone.

64
00:06:06,780 --> 00:06:08,780
This mountain is...

65
00:06:09,780 --> 00:06:12,780
I'm the one who's leading this mountain.

66
00:06:12,780 --> 00:06:14,780
I want to go through this.

67
00:06:14,780 --> 00:06:16,780
Little kids,

68
00:06:16,780 --> 00:06:18,780
don't read books.

69
00:06:18,780 --> 00:06:20,780
You're a mountain thief.

70
00:06:20,780 --> 00:06:22,780
You're too small.

71
00:06:38,780 --> 00:06:40,780
I'm the one who's leading this mountain.

72
00:06:40,780 --> 00:06:42,780
I'm the one who's leading this mountain.

73
00:06:42,780 --> 00:06:44,780
I'm the one who's leading this mountain.

74
00:06:44,780 --> 00:06:46,780
I'm the one who's leading this mountain.

75
00:06:46,780 --> 00:06:48,780
I'm the one who's leading this mountain.

76
00:06:48,780 --> 00:06:50,780
I'm the one who's leading this mountain.

77
00:06:50,780 --> 00:06:52,780
I'm the one who's leading this mountain.

78
00:06:52,780 --> 00:06:54,780
I'm the one who's leading this mountain.

79
00:06:54,780 --> 00:06:56,780
I'm the one who's leading this mountain.

80
00:06:56,780 --> 00:06:58,780
I'm the one who's leading this mountain.

81
00:06:58,780 --> 00:07:00,780
I'm the one who's leading this mountain.

82
00:07:00,780 --> 00:07:02,780
I'm the one who's leading this mountain.

83
00:07:02,780 --> 00:07:04,780
I'm the one who's leading this mountain.

84
00:07:04,780 --> 00:07:06,780
I'm the one who's leading this mountain.

85
00:07:06,780 --> 00:07:08,780
Little kids,

86
00:07:08,780 --> 00:07:10,780
the place where the world is clean

87
00:07:10,780 --> 00:07:12,780
and the world is smooth.

88
00:07:12,780 --> 00:07:14,780
Who's that girl?

89
00:07:14,780 --> 00:07:16,780
No, little girl.

90
00:07:16,780 --> 00:07:18,780
What's wrong with you?

91
00:07:20,780 --> 00:07:22,780
I'm a little girl.

92
00:07:22,780 --> 00:07:24,780
What are you laughing at?

93
00:07:24,780 --> 00:07:26,780
I'm the little brother who's killing the heart of the people.

94
00:07:26,780 --> 00:07:28,780
Little brother?

95
00:07:28,780 --> 00:07:30,780
If you say it,

96
00:07:30,780 --> 00:07:32,780
I'll scare you to death.

97
00:07:36,780 --> 00:07:38,780
This person is 34,000 years old.

98
00:07:42,780 --> 00:07:44,780
He's the monster.

99
00:07:44,780 --> 00:07:46,780
He's a thousand years old monster.

100
00:07:46,780 --> 00:07:48,780
Who are you talking about?

101
00:07:48,780 --> 00:07:50,780
He's been living for a long time.

102
00:07:50,780 --> 00:07:52,780
He's a monster and a god.

103
00:08:07,260 --> 00:08:09,260
I'm the 자 medicines.

104
00:08:09,260 --> 00:08:11,260
They're real medicine.

105
00:08:13,260 --> 00:08:17,260
You're talking about the adaeng medicine that deformed the entire disease of the world?

106
00:08:17,260 --> 00:08:19,100
No.

107
00:08:19,100 --> 00:08:22,700
It's a set medicine.

108
00:08:22,700 --> 00:08:24,700
I knew it.

109
00:08:26,940 --> 00:08:30,940
You're saying that you evaluated and identified them differently.

110
00:08:30,940 --> 00:08:32,940
That's also true.

111
00:08:32,940 --> 00:08:35,340
You're so relieved that you came out alone?

112
00:08:37,100 --> 00:08:39,300
The god of the Great Wilderness has already been dead.

113
00:08:39,300 --> 00:08:40,500
How could there be a control of me?

114
00:08:41,300 --> 00:08:42,100
Great Wilderness...

115
00:08:43,420 --> 00:08:44,420
What's wrong with Great Wilderness?

116
00:08:49,340 --> 00:08:50,780
After the death of Ling Xiao Shui,

117
00:08:50,780 --> 00:08:52,340
Great Wilderness began to collapse.

118
00:08:53,180 --> 00:08:55,380
Grandpa had to close the door of Kunlun.

119
00:08:56,140 --> 00:08:58,220
He cut off the history of Great Wilderness and the world.

120
00:08:58,820 --> 00:09:00,540
This is the end of the collapse.

121
00:09:00,780 --> 00:09:03,380
But then, there was another monster.

122
00:09:03,940 --> 00:09:06,100
He opened the door of Kunlun in his own way.

123
00:09:06,380 --> 00:09:08,340
Then there were many monsters running towards the world.

124
00:09:08,660 --> 00:09:09,660
The two worlds were in chaos.

125
00:09:09,860 --> 00:09:12,740
This led to the problem of Ling Ji's progress.

126
00:09:13,540 --> 00:09:14,460
It's hard to maintain.

127
00:09:15,900 --> 00:09:17,460
My grandpa and other gods

128
00:09:17,620 --> 00:09:20,540
can only use their own power to force the world to collapse.

129
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:24,140
I just don't know how long it will take.

130
00:09:29,100 --> 00:09:29,900
The more I talk, the more annoying it is.

131
00:09:30,660 --> 00:09:31,980
The god of the White-Eyes monster.

132
00:09:32,260 --> 00:09:33,260
Great Wilderness is dead.

133
00:09:33,420 --> 00:09:34,420
I don't know where he is.

134
00:09:51,780 --> 00:09:53,300
You're so ridiculous.

135
00:09:53,660 --> 00:09:55,100
Your grandpa was also in Great Wilderness's life.

136
00:09:55,220 --> 00:09:57,060
But you went to the human world to take the medicine.

137
00:09:57,300 --> 00:09:58,780
I'm not here to play the human world.

138
00:09:59,220 --> 00:10:00,300
I'm here to fulfill my dream.

139
00:10:00,380 --> 00:10:01,620
And my grandpa is really mine.

140
00:10:04,980 --> 00:10:05,860
I'm not going to play the grandpa.

141
00:10:06,580 --> 00:10:07,980
I just know that I'm almost done.

142
00:10:08,900 --> 00:10:09,940
I just agreed.

143
00:10:15,500 --> 00:10:18,300
It seems that you're no longer human.

144
00:10:20,220 --> 00:10:21,020
You're so talkative.

145
00:10:21,220 --> 00:10:21,860
Who are you?

146
00:10:22,060 --> 00:10:23,540
He's a real monster.

147
00:10:23,780 --> 00:10:24,540
Are you afraid?

148
00:10:24,780 --> 00:10:26,620
You're the one who's so stupid.

149
00:10:27,340 --> 00:10:28,340
No matter how much you talk,

150
00:10:28,660 --> 00:10:30,100
I'll beat you up on this mountain.

151
00:10:30,180 --> 00:10:30,580
I'll beat you up.

152
00:10:30,740 --> 00:10:31,340
Okay, okay.

153
00:10:31,820 --> 00:10:32,700
Why do we have to stop

154
00:10:32,860 --> 00:10:34,180
and listen to two little quarrels?

155
00:10:34,900 --> 00:10:36,060
Okay, stop it.

156
00:10:36,820 --> 00:10:38,980
You respect the people there, right?

157
00:10:39,300 --> 00:10:41,580
They're here to kill us.

158
00:10:43,060 --> 00:10:43,580
Let's go.

159
00:10:43,940 --> 00:10:44,380
Let's go.

160
00:10:44,660 --> 00:10:45,180
Let's go.

161
00:10:45,780 --> 00:10:46,620
Hurry up.

162
00:10:46,740 --> 00:10:47,340
Hurry up.

163
00:10:47,500 --> 00:10:48,740
Let's go get you some beer.

164
00:10:50,780 --> 00:10:51,780
It's late.

165
00:10:52,580 --> 00:10:53,540
Let's get in the way.

166
00:10:54,140 --> 00:10:56,420
How do we deal with this little monster?

167
00:10:57,540 --> 00:10:58,900
We have to deal with him.

168
00:10:59,580 --> 00:11:00,300
There's really no way

169
00:11:00,460 --> 00:11:01,500
his scythe can vain him.

170
00:11:01,660 --> 00:11:03,100
And it's the same for my head.

171
00:11:03,460 --> 00:11:05,620
And this is our host,

172
00:11:05,700 --> 00:11:07,740
the little monster who looks exactly like you.

173
00:11:09,420 --> 00:11:11,380
Thejeans in the stockings are awesome.

174
00:11:11,820 --> 00:11:13,020
It's even better than your

175
00:11:13,340 --> 00:11:16,140
loz Hot slaves.

176
00:11:17,780 --> 00:11:18,540
Bravo.

177
00:11:18,740 --> 00:11:19,500
Get out of my way.

178
00:11:20,380 --> 00:11:21,220
NDGala.

179
00:11:28,900 --> 00:11:30,900
I'm going to kill you.

180
00:11:30,900 --> 00:11:31,900
Don't move.

181
00:11:38,900 --> 00:11:40,900
Okay, I'm going to hit you.

182
00:11:41,900 --> 00:11:42,900
What is this?

183
00:11:42,900 --> 00:11:43,900
It's so powerful.

184
00:11:43,900 --> 00:11:44,900
It's so soft and soft.

185
00:11:44,900 --> 00:11:45,900
I'm out of energy.

186
00:11:45,900 --> 00:11:48,900
I know you have a lot of magic.

187
00:11:49,900 --> 00:11:51,900
If you don't want to be brought back to the G14,

188
00:11:52,900 --> 00:11:56,900
just give your treasure out.

189
00:11:58,900 --> 00:12:00,900
I'll kill you.

190
00:12:08,900 --> 00:12:09,900
Call me.

191
00:12:11,900 --> 00:12:12,900
Little Red.

192
00:12:28,900 --> 00:12:30,900
What is this treasure?

193
00:12:30,900 --> 00:12:32,900
Do you want to fool us?

194
00:12:32,900 --> 00:12:33,900
This is my treasure.

195
00:12:33,900 --> 00:12:35,900
A treasure that leads to dreams.

196
00:12:35,900 --> 00:12:36,900
I finally collected it.

197
00:12:37,900 --> 00:12:38,900
You don't understand.

198
00:12:44,900 --> 00:12:47,900
I'm always carrying my dream.

199
00:12:49,900 --> 00:12:52,900
Your dream is to carry a pot?

200
00:12:52,900 --> 00:12:53,900
It's a kitchen.

201
00:12:54,900 --> 00:12:56,900
It's to make delicious food.

202
00:12:56,900 --> 00:12:58,900
It's to make delicious food.

203
00:13:02,900 --> 00:13:03,900
It's all here.

204
00:13:08,900 --> 00:13:09,900
It's not these.

205
00:13:21,900 --> 00:13:22,900
Is this what you said?

206
00:13:27,900 --> 00:13:28,900
Ta-da.

207
00:13:30,900 --> 00:13:31,900
What is this?

208
00:13:32,900 --> 00:13:33,900
A box.

209
00:13:33,900 --> 00:13:36,900
This is a magic that Shanshan used to transport

210
00:13:36,900 --> 00:13:39,900
thousands of miles of energy to the mountains and seas.

211
00:13:39,900 --> 00:13:42,900
With it, we can immediately go back to the G14.

212
00:13:44,900 --> 00:13:45,900
How do I use it?

213
00:13:45,900 --> 00:13:47,900
This is a magic of Shanshan.

214
00:13:47,900 --> 00:13:50,900
Of course, Shanshan needs magic.

215
00:13:53,900 --> 00:13:54,900
I just called for a small request.

216
00:13:54,900 --> 00:13:56,900
Now I'm calling for Shanshan.

217
00:13:57,900 --> 00:13:58,900
A mortal.

218
00:13:59,900 --> 00:14:00,900
And this is my thing.

219
00:14:00,900 --> 00:14:01,900
Why do I need it?

220
00:14:02,900 --> 00:14:03,900
You help us.

221
00:14:03,900 --> 00:14:05,900
We will naturally help you.

222
00:14:06,900 --> 00:14:07,900
What help?

223
00:14:08,900 --> 00:14:10,900
I have no desire, no heart, no value.

224
00:14:13,900 --> 00:14:14,900
I'll help you realize your dream.

225
00:14:17,900 --> 00:14:18,900
You want to be a chef, right?

226
00:14:19,900 --> 00:14:21,900
We just need a chef in G14.

227
00:14:21,900 --> 00:14:22,900
We also need a chef.

228
00:14:27,900 --> 00:14:28,900
You don't mind if I'm a demon?

229
00:14:29,900 --> 00:14:31,900
You just said you're a little Shanshan.

230
00:14:31,900 --> 00:14:33,900
Of course I don't mind.

231
00:14:33,900 --> 00:14:34,900
We G14

232
00:14:34,900 --> 00:14:36,900
are taught every day by the demons.

233
00:14:40,900 --> 00:14:41,900
And there are many people in G14

234
00:14:41,900 --> 00:14:43,900
who need various food every day.

235
00:14:43,900 --> 00:14:44,900
And the servants who are special

236
00:14:44,900 --> 00:14:47,900
are responsible for buying various fresh ingredients every day.

237
00:14:47,900 --> 00:14:48,900
The whole kitchen

238
00:14:48,900 --> 00:14:50,900
has a huge temple of Shanshan.

239
00:14:50,900 --> 00:14:52,900
There are many kinds of food.

240
00:15:16,900 --> 00:15:17,900
The mountains and seas are quiet.

241
00:15:17,900 --> 00:15:18,900
You can only use it to go to a place

242
00:15:18,900 --> 00:15:19,900
that you know.

243
00:15:20,900 --> 00:15:21,900
Have you been to G14?

244
00:15:22,900 --> 00:15:23,900
Of course.

245
00:15:23,900 --> 00:15:24,900
I've been to it several times.

246
00:15:32,900 --> 00:15:33,900
Let's start.

247
00:15:50,900 --> 00:15:51,900
The mountain and the river are quiet.

248
00:15:51,900 --> 00:15:52,900
You can only use it to go to a place that you know.

249
00:15:52,900 --> 00:15:53,900
Have you been to G14?

250
00:15:53,900 --> 00:15:54,900
Of course.

251
00:15:54,900 --> 00:15:55,900
I've been to G14.

252
00:15:55,900 --> 00:15:56,900
I've been to G14.

253
00:15:56,900 --> 00:15:57,900
I've been to G14.

254
00:15:57,900 --> 00:15:58,900
I've been to G14.

255
00:15:58,900 --> 00:15:59,900
I've been to G14.

256
00:15:59,900 --> 00:16:00,900
I've been to G14.

257
00:16:00,900 --> 00:16:01,900
I've been to G14.

258
00:16:01,900 --> 00:16:02,900
I've been to G14.

259
00:16:02,900 --> 00:16:03,900
I've been to G14.

260
00:16:03,900 --> 00:16:04,900
I've been to G14.

261
00:16:04,900 --> 00:16:05,900
I've been to G14.

262
00:16:05,900 --> 00:16:06,900
I've been to G14.

263
00:16:06,900 --> 00:16:07,900
I've been to G14.

264
00:16:07,900 --> 00:16:08,900
I've been to G14.

265
00:16:08,900 --> 00:16:09,900
I've been to G14.

266
00:16:09,900 --> 00:16:10,900
I've been to G14.

267
00:16:10,900 --> 00:16:11,900
I've been to G14.

268
00:16:11,900 --> 00:16:12,900
I've been to G14.

269
00:16:12,900 --> 00:16:13,900
I've been to G14.

270
00:16:13,900 --> 00:16:14,900
I've been to G14.

271
00:16:15,900 --> 00:16:18,900
A dream is willing to be Kubernetes on 4 O'clock

272
00:16:18,900 --> 00:16:20,900
Haters go on to G14

273
00:16:20,900 --> 00:16:22,900
You're watching the wind and rain

274
00:16:22,900 --> 00:16:26,900
billowing with the harrowing

275
00:16:29,900 --> 00:16:30,900
It appears that G14

276
00:16:31,900 --> 00:16:32,900
has no message any more.

277
00:16:34,900 --> 00:16:36,900
Since that is the case

278
00:16:37,900 --> 00:16:39,900
I'll go first and see the 2 masters up there.

279
00:16:44,900 --> 00:16:50,600
Mister Zhen只会给你一杯同汤

280
00:16:50,900 --> 00:17:02,580
Your Lordship, please give us another

281
00:17:03,640 --> 00:17:07,620
That's not your goodness

282
00:17:07,620 --> 00:17:13,700
This is truly unbearable

283
00:17:20,960 --> 00:17:26,020
Even if we are suffering, it is still so

284
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:33,040
These become artists

285
00:17:33,060 --> 00:17:36,980
The only hope is what I get

286
00:17:36,980 --> 00:17:38,060
Already broke up

287
00:17:38,300 --> 00:17:39,420
Five people wrote the list first

288
00:17:39,740 --> 00:17:40,660
Have too

289
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:59,280
Toot

290
00:18:06,980 --> 00:18:12,200
It was good news, but people still sleep Audicare.

291
00:18:17,820 --> 00:18:19,200
Is that?

292
00:18:19,240 --> 00:18:20,400
Hello, big guys.

293
00:18:20,440 --> 00:18:21,460
It's me,comper.

294
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:24,200
It's Victor from Google Play Store.

295
00:18:26,120 --> 00:18:30,860
I'm here to have a bottle of theesten and enumbil.

296
00:18:32,380 --> 00:18:33,560
I'ts my responsibility.

297
00:18:33,560 --> 00:18:36,040
.

298
00:18:46,840 --> 00:18:54,240
...

299
00:18:54,460 --> 00:19:00,980
...

300
00:19:03,560 --> 00:19:06,560
I'm afraid that I'll have to leave you.

301
00:19:07,560 --> 00:19:12,560
Even if I have to leave, I'll have to say goodbye.

302
00:19:18,560 --> 00:19:21,560
I decided to stay in the Jiao Temple.

303
00:19:25,560 --> 00:19:26,560
What's wrong?

304
00:19:27,560 --> 00:19:28,560
You don't want to?

305
00:19:28,560 --> 00:19:30,560
I... I'm too willing.

306
00:19:33,560 --> 00:19:35,560
I want to be with you.

307
00:19:50,560 --> 00:19:54,560
I didn't want to do anything else.

308
00:19:57,560 --> 00:19:59,560
Maybe I always run away.

309
00:20:00,560 --> 00:20:04,560
But when I was born, I used my eyes,

310
00:20:04,560 --> 00:20:07,560
ears, and heart.

311
00:20:09,560 --> 00:20:14,560
I wanted to understand the small things in order to live a clear life.

312
00:20:17,560 --> 00:20:19,560
So I decided to stay out of it.

313
00:20:19,560 --> 00:20:21,560
I was born.

314
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:32,560
A little boy woke me up.

315
00:20:37,560 --> 00:20:38,560
It's dawn.

316
00:20:40,560 --> 00:20:41,560
Thank you.

317
00:20:42,560 --> 00:20:44,560
The darkness I gave me

318
00:20:44,560 --> 00:20:48,560
brought me a broken heart.

319
00:21:14,560 --> 00:21:17,560
I'm a black and white wound.

320
00:21:17,560 --> 00:21:20,560
You are the red color of the red.

321
00:21:20,560 --> 00:21:22,560
How could I not remember?

322
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:25,560
You are always in my mind.

323
00:21:25,560 --> 00:21:32,560
The breeze makes this flower not fall.

324
00:21:44,560 --> 00:21:47,560
It made meench burning transporting the becomes of the war.

325
00:21:55,560 --> 00:21:56,560
Brilliant.

326
00:21:56,560 --> 00:21:59,560
Or he can easily make a pill to reduce rape.

327
00:22:00,560 --> 00:22:03,560
Well, isn't there really a safe place?

328
00:22:03,560 --> 00:22:07,560
The creating shadows, setting out of the 싶은 to the sky,

329
00:22:07,560 --> 00:22:08,560
are indeed quite good.

330
00:22:08,560 --> 00:22:12,560
But they didn't look exactly like the place you should live by

331
00:22:12,560 --> 00:22:16,560
I opened the barrier to welcome you to the world.

332
00:22:16,560 --> 00:22:18,560
You really have a bad temper.

333
00:22:19,560 --> 00:22:22,560
Where should I live, Mr. Xiao Zhuo?

334
00:22:23,560 --> 00:22:26,560
The place you live should be at least the place where the bones are.

335
00:22:27,560 --> 00:22:28,560
It's full of blood.

336
00:22:30,560 --> 00:22:31,560
That's why I'm worthy of you.

337
00:22:34,560 --> 00:22:36,560
The person who holds the blood first

338
00:22:37,560 --> 00:22:39,560
is the one who loves wood and powder.

339
00:22:39,560 --> 00:22:40,560
I'm a good person.

340
00:22:41,560 --> 00:22:42,560
I've come to the world

341
00:22:42,560 --> 00:22:43,560
and I've learned the most important thing

342
00:22:44,560 --> 00:22:45,560
in my life.

343
00:22:46,560 --> 00:22:50,560
I want to learn to show the true me.

344
00:22:53,560 --> 00:22:54,560
You're not human.

345
00:22:57,560 --> 00:22:59,560
You're so rude.

346
00:22:59,560 --> 00:23:01,560
You're really making me jealous.

347
00:23:02,560 --> 00:23:04,560
I'm a good person.

348
00:23:06,560 --> 00:23:07,560
I'm a good person.

349
00:23:07,560 --> 00:23:08,560
I'm a good person.

350
00:23:08,560 --> 00:23:09,560
I'm a good person.

351
00:23:09,560 --> 00:23:10,560
I'm a good person.

352
00:23:10,560 --> 00:23:11,560
I'm a good person.

353
00:23:11,560 --> 00:23:12,560
I'm a good person.

354
00:23:14,560 --> 00:23:15,560
I'm a good person.

355
00:23:20,560 --> 00:23:22,560
We've cleared the water barrier

356
00:23:22,560 --> 00:23:23,560
with our bare hands.

357
00:23:24,560 --> 00:23:26,560
The crisis of the Jiao Si has finally been solved.

358
00:23:27,560 --> 00:23:28,560
Jiao Si is still here.

359
00:23:28,560 --> 00:23:29,560
His head is still here.

360
00:23:29,560 --> 00:23:30,560
That's great.

361
00:23:30,560 --> 00:23:31,560
Don't be too happy.

362
00:23:31,560 --> 00:23:32,560
Jiao Si is in there.

363
00:23:32,560 --> 00:23:34,560
He might fall down.

364
00:23:36,560 --> 00:23:38,560
If you want to push out Jiao Si now,

365
00:23:38,560 --> 00:23:39,560
you can do it.

366
00:23:41,560 --> 00:23:42,560
I was a little scared.

367
00:23:43,560 --> 00:23:44,560
But in the team,

368
00:23:44,560 --> 00:23:46,560
there's the most powerful Lord Xiao Zhuo in the East.

369
00:23:46,560 --> 00:23:47,560
I'm not afraid.

370
00:23:49,560 --> 00:23:51,560
When I met him in danger,

371
00:23:51,560 --> 00:23:52,560
Lord Xiao Zhuo

372
00:23:52,560 --> 00:23:54,560
has been protecting me silently.

373
00:23:56,560 --> 00:23:57,560
I can protect you, too.

374
00:23:57,560 --> 00:23:59,560
I'm a god of mountains.

375
00:24:01,560 --> 00:24:03,560
I hope Sister Wen can find Bai Ze Ling soon,

376
00:24:03,560 --> 00:24:04,560
so that the monster

377
00:24:04,560 --> 00:24:06,560
can't be a fly in the crowd

378
00:24:06,560 --> 00:24:08,560
and hurt people in the field.

379
00:24:08,560 --> 00:24:10,560
It won't be a disaster

380
00:24:10,560 --> 00:24:12,560
that I'll prepare for Miss Qi.

381
00:24:14,560 --> 00:24:15,560
With Bai Ze Ling,

382
00:24:15,560 --> 00:24:17,560
you can control the monster at any cost.

383
00:24:19,560 --> 00:24:20,560
That's great.

384
00:24:20,560 --> 00:24:21,560
I must help Sister Wen

385
00:24:21,560 --> 00:24:22,560
to find Bai Ze Ling.

386
00:24:24,560 --> 00:24:25,560
That's how I can do it.

387
00:24:30,560 --> 00:24:32,560
What did you say?

388
00:24:32,560 --> 00:24:34,560
Buy some wine?

389
00:24:36,560 --> 00:24:38,560
I didn't say anything.

390
00:24:38,560 --> 00:24:40,560
Cheers.

391
00:24:40,560 --> 00:24:42,560
Okay.

392
00:24:50,560 --> 00:24:52,560
How can I have tea?

393
00:24:52,560 --> 00:24:54,560
What wine do kids drink?

394
00:24:56,560 --> 00:24:58,560
You said I'm a kid.

395
00:24:58,560 --> 00:25:00,560
How old are you?

396
00:25:02,560 --> 00:25:06,560
I think I'm 18 years old.

397
00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:08,560
18?

398
00:25:08,560 --> 00:25:10,560
No one is 18 years old.

399
00:25:10,560 --> 00:25:12,560
You look like a tiger.

400
00:25:14,560 --> 00:25:16,560
I think I should be a good boy.

401
00:25:16,560 --> 00:25:20,560
I'll go to Zhao Yunzhu's room and see.

402
00:25:20,560 --> 00:25:22,560
He's so old.

403
00:25:22,560 --> 00:25:24,560
He's always talking.

404
00:25:28,560 --> 00:25:32,560
You're going to get ugly.

405
00:25:32,560 --> 00:25:34,560
Mirror, mirror.

406
00:25:34,560 --> 00:25:36,560
Promise me.

407
00:25:36,560 --> 00:25:38,560
Please remember me.

408
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:40,560
The most handsome 200 years old.

409
00:25:50,560 --> 00:25:52,560
This...

410
00:25:52,560 --> 00:25:54,560
Why do I need tea?

411
00:25:54,560 --> 00:25:56,560
I want some too.

412
00:25:56,560 --> 00:25:58,560
I'll go.

413
00:26:20,560 --> 00:26:22,560
Look.

414
00:26:22,560 --> 00:26:26,560
What is this?

415
00:26:32,560 --> 00:26:34,560
A small child's meal.

416
00:26:34,560 --> 00:26:36,560
Here.

417
00:26:38,560 --> 00:26:40,560
How is it?

418
00:26:40,560 --> 00:26:42,560
Is it good?

419
00:26:42,560 --> 00:26:44,560
It's very good.

420
00:26:46,560 --> 00:26:50,560
Yinglei, I helped you to become a chef in Jiao Si.

421
00:26:50,560 --> 00:26:52,560
You're my dream.

422
00:26:52,560 --> 00:26:54,560
Are you going to give me a love?

423
00:26:54,560 --> 00:26:56,560
No problem.

424
00:26:58,560 --> 00:27:00,560
Help me steal Zhao Yunzhu's water pot.

425
00:27:04,560 --> 00:27:06,560
This...

426
00:27:06,560 --> 00:27:08,560
It's a big problem.

427
00:27:10,560 --> 00:27:14,560
I'm curious about what's in his water pot.

428
00:27:14,560 --> 00:27:16,560
He's been on the road.

429
00:27:16,560 --> 00:27:18,560
He didn't move anything except drinking water.

430
00:27:18,560 --> 00:27:20,560
It's a small problem.

431
00:27:22,560 --> 00:27:26,560
I've already smelled what's in his water pot.

432
00:27:26,560 --> 00:27:28,560
The jade bracelet.

433
00:27:30,560 --> 00:27:32,560
Mr. Zhou, what kind of jade do you like?

434
00:27:32,560 --> 00:27:34,560
I don't want to say.

435
00:27:34,560 --> 00:27:36,560
I'll just eat jade.

436
00:27:40,560 --> 00:27:42,560
Do you know what jade is?

437
00:27:42,560 --> 00:27:44,560
Jade.

438
00:27:48,560 --> 00:27:50,560
I have a feeling that

439
00:27:50,560 --> 00:27:52,560
the jade bracelet is very big.

440
00:27:52,560 --> 00:27:54,560
It's a little bigger than my head.

441
00:27:54,560 --> 00:27:56,560
I can't say it.

442
00:27:56,560 --> 00:27:58,560
I see.

443
00:27:58,560 --> 00:28:00,560
It's a little bigger than my head.

444
00:28:00,560 --> 00:28:02,560
Do you have a feeling that

445
00:28:02,560 --> 00:28:04,560
it's a little bigger than your head?

446
00:28:04,560 --> 00:28:06,560
It's a little bigger than my head.

447
00:28:06,560 --> 00:28:08,560
I don't know what's in your water pot.

448
00:28:08,560 --> 00:28:10,560
I'll go.

449
00:28:10,560 --> 00:28:12,560
I'll go.

450
00:28:12,560 --> 00:28:14,560
Here.

451
00:28:14,560 --> 00:28:16,560
Take it.

452
00:28:16,560 --> 00:28:17,560
It's really beautiful.

453
00:28:17,560 --> 00:28:18,560
Yes.

454
00:28:20,560 --> 00:28:21,560
Da You,

455
00:28:21,560 --> 00:28:23,560
just now, you were talking to Mr. Zhu.

456
00:28:23,560 --> 00:28:25,560
Where did you go to the hospital?

457
00:28:30,560 --> 00:28:32,560
Let's do another poison.

458
00:28:34,560 --> 00:28:35,560
What poison?

459
00:28:35,560 --> 00:28:38,560
Let's see who can break the water rule first.

460
00:28:38,560 --> 00:28:40,560
If we lose,

461
00:28:40,560 --> 00:28:42,560
we have to do something for the other party.

462
00:28:42,560 --> 00:28:44,560
We can.

463
00:28:45,560 --> 00:28:47,560
But this matter

464
00:28:47,560 --> 00:28:49,560
must be taken care of.

465
00:28:50,560 --> 00:28:52,560
It won't hurt the heaven.

466
00:28:53,560 --> 00:28:55,560
I hope you agree, Mr. Zhu.

467
00:28:56,560 --> 00:28:57,560
You are a good girl.

468
00:28:57,560 --> 00:28:59,560
You won't even have this kind of energy.

469
00:29:01,560 --> 00:29:03,560
You are looking at me behind your back, right?

470
00:29:03,560 --> 00:29:05,560
My face is red.

471
00:29:08,560 --> 00:29:10,560
It's because I broke the water rule with Wen Xiao.

472
00:29:11,560 --> 00:29:13,560
Mr. Zhu, you really want to investigate.

473
00:29:13,560 --> 00:29:15,560
You said it yourself.

474
00:29:15,560 --> 00:29:17,560
Before I entered the Jiao Temple,

475
00:29:17,560 --> 00:29:20,560
I already knew the murderer was Ran Yi.

476
00:29:20,560 --> 00:29:22,560
That was my first case.

477
00:29:24,560 --> 00:29:26,560
I'm willing to take revenge.

478
00:29:26,560 --> 00:29:28,560
But you won't be tired.

479
00:29:29,560 --> 00:29:31,560
You know Ran Yi is a criminal.

480
00:29:31,560 --> 00:29:33,560
You should be more careful with him.

481
00:29:33,560 --> 00:29:35,560
You are just a accomplice.

482
00:29:37,560 --> 00:29:39,560
It's a good idea.

483
00:29:39,560 --> 00:29:41,560
It's easy to break.

484
00:29:43,560 --> 00:29:45,560
What's wrong?

485
00:29:45,560 --> 00:29:48,560
Someone gave me a good hat.

486
00:29:58,560 --> 00:30:00,560
I did this

487
00:30:00,560 --> 00:30:02,560
because I know you well.

488
00:30:03,560 --> 00:30:05,560
I'm not bad.

489
00:30:05,560 --> 00:30:07,560
I only met you a few days ago.

490
00:30:07,560 --> 00:30:09,560
You know me well.

491
00:30:10,560 --> 00:30:12,560
You are a dreamer.

492
00:30:12,560 --> 00:30:14,560
The whole Tian Du City knows

493
00:30:15,560 --> 00:30:17,560
that you are a good person.

494
00:30:17,560 --> 00:30:19,560
You are a good person.

495
00:30:19,560 --> 00:30:21,560
You are good at fighting evil.

496
00:30:21,560 --> 00:30:23,560
You are good at fighting evil.

497
00:30:23,560 --> 00:30:25,560
You are a good person.

498
00:30:25,560 --> 00:30:27,560
You are a good person.

499
00:30:27,560 --> 00:30:29,560
You are a good person.

500
00:30:29,560 --> 00:30:31,560
Isn't that right?

501
00:30:33,560 --> 00:30:35,560
That's right.

502
00:30:36,560 --> 00:30:38,560
So,

503
00:30:38,560 --> 00:30:41,560
if I tell you the whereabouts of the murderer,

504
00:30:41,560 --> 00:30:43,560
that evil Mr. Zhu will

505
00:30:43,560 --> 00:30:46,560
immediately go to the table to get Ran Yi.

506
00:30:47,560 --> 00:30:50,560
Then how can I find the clue of Bai Ze Ling?

507
00:30:51,560 --> 00:30:53,560
It's just a matter of time.

508
00:30:53,560 --> 00:30:56,560
You can't be a criminal.

509
00:30:56,560 --> 00:30:58,560
If you want to achieve your goal,

510
00:30:58,560 --> 00:31:01,560
you have to use some very important methods.

511
00:31:01,560 --> 00:31:03,560
Mr. Zhu,

512
00:31:03,560 --> 00:31:05,560
you are right.

513
00:31:05,560 --> 00:31:07,560
You can agree.

514
00:31:07,560 --> 00:31:10,560
But you can't be too stubborn.

515
00:31:16,560 --> 00:31:18,560
Take me away.

516
00:31:18,560 --> 00:31:20,560
No.

517
00:31:20,560 --> 00:31:22,560
You...

518
00:31:28,560 --> 00:31:30,560
You have already hidden Ran Yi's whereabouts.

519
00:31:30,560 --> 00:31:33,560
You even want to take us all in.

520
00:31:33,560 --> 00:31:35,560
It's a lie.

521
00:31:35,560 --> 00:31:37,560
But you are all too smart.

522
00:31:37,560 --> 00:31:39,560
You didn't lie.

523
00:31:39,560 --> 00:31:42,560
If you didn't lie, it doesn't mean you didn't do it.

524
00:31:42,560 --> 00:31:44,560
Zhao Yanzhou,

525
00:31:44,560 --> 00:31:46,560
your cunningness is like a yellow.

526
00:31:46,560 --> 00:31:48,560
You can protect Xiao Zhuang.

527
00:31:48,560 --> 00:31:50,560
But you can't protect me.

528
00:31:50,560 --> 00:31:52,560
He is scolding you.

529
00:31:52,560 --> 00:31:54,560
I...

530
00:31:56,560 --> 00:31:59,560
Although we are different personalities,

531
00:31:59,560 --> 00:32:01,560
we have different hands.

532
00:32:01,560 --> 00:32:03,560
But our goal is the same.

533
00:32:03,560 --> 00:32:05,560
We should be able to open up to each other

534
00:32:05,560 --> 00:32:07,560
and talk to each other.

535
00:32:07,560 --> 00:32:09,560
Just like Qiu Qian,

536
00:32:09,560 --> 00:32:11,560
you have to trust the person behind you

537
00:32:11,560 --> 00:32:13,560
to be more brave.

538
00:32:14,560 --> 00:32:16,560
You know how to push Qiu Qian.

539
00:32:16,560 --> 00:32:18,560
Don't you understand?

540
00:32:26,560 --> 00:32:31,560
Ran Yi is not a threat to Xiao Yao.

541
00:32:31,560 --> 00:32:33,560
What about Lillun?

542
00:32:33,560 --> 00:32:35,560
You have hidden Lillun's existence.

543
00:32:35,560 --> 00:32:37,560
You almost made Wen Xiao go to hell.

544
00:32:37,560 --> 00:32:39,560
Lillun won't really kill her.

545
00:32:39,560 --> 00:32:42,560
If Lillun really wants to kill Wen Xiao,

546
00:32:42,560 --> 00:32:45,560
you can't stop him.

547
00:32:48,560 --> 00:32:50,560
Then what does he want?

548
00:32:54,560 --> 00:32:56,560
I don't know.

549
00:32:56,560 --> 00:32:59,560
He is...

550
00:32:59,560 --> 00:33:01,560
always silent.

551
00:33:05,560 --> 00:33:07,560
Wait.

552
00:33:11,560 --> 00:33:13,560
Xiao Zhuang is not playing anymore?

553
00:33:13,560 --> 00:33:16,560
Is it because I said you were not aware of the change?

554
00:33:16,560 --> 00:33:18,560
Are you angry?

555
00:33:18,560 --> 00:33:20,560
You just said

556
00:33:20,560 --> 00:33:23,560
you only like to play with Qiu Qian and not to push Qiu Qian.

557
00:33:23,560 --> 00:33:26,560
You are not happy now.

558
00:33:26,560 --> 00:33:29,560
You are still so young.

559
00:33:29,560 --> 00:33:31,560
You are angry?

560
00:33:31,560 --> 00:33:33,560
Then come here.

561
00:33:33,560 --> 00:33:35,560
I will push you.

562
00:33:38,560 --> 00:33:40,560
You are crazy.

563
00:33:40,560 --> 00:33:42,560
How old are you?

564
00:33:42,560 --> 00:33:44,560
Who likes to play with Qiu Qian?

565
00:33:47,560 --> 00:33:49,560
He is scolding you.

566
00:33:50,560 --> 00:33:52,560
Keep pushing.

567
00:33:53,560 --> 00:33:56,560
They should be playing with Qiu Qian.

568
00:33:56,560 --> 00:33:59,560
Xiao Zhu is playing with Qiu Qian.

569
00:34:11,560 --> 00:34:13,560
I just told you.

570
00:34:13,560 --> 00:34:15,560
Is it good?

571
00:34:16,560 --> 00:34:18,560
It's good.

572
00:34:18,560 --> 00:34:22,560
Tianxiang Pavilion's 16 flowers and wine is really famous.

573
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:25,560
It's so good.

574
00:34:25,560 --> 00:34:28,560
You are so good at it.

575
00:34:28,560 --> 00:34:30,560
You are a mountain god.

576
00:34:30,560 --> 00:34:33,560
You just came down the mountain and you have heard so much about it.

577
00:34:33,560 --> 00:34:35,560
You know Tianxiang Pavilion?

578
00:34:35,560 --> 00:34:37,560
Yes.

579
00:34:38,560 --> 00:34:40,560
When I just came down the mountain,

580
00:34:40,560 --> 00:34:43,560
I heard that the Tianxiang Pavilion is really a beautiful place.

581
00:34:43,560 --> 00:34:46,560
It must be more beautiful.

582
00:34:48,560 --> 00:34:51,560
I thought that when I have a chance to go to the hot spring.

583
00:34:51,560 --> 00:34:54,560
If you want to go, I will tell Wenjie.

584
00:34:58,560 --> 00:35:02,560
Unless you take me with you, I will not tell Wenjie.

585
00:35:06,560 --> 00:35:08,560
Drink more.

586
00:35:08,560 --> 00:35:09,560
No.

587
00:35:09,560 --> 00:35:11,560
Why are you so sad?

588
00:35:12,560 --> 00:35:14,560
It's okay. I will go and take a look.

589
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:17,560
You are eating so little. What's so good about it?

590
00:35:25,560 --> 00:35:27,560
Sister Pei.

591
00:35:28,560 --> 00:35:32,560
Your face is not so good.

592
00:35:38,560 --> 00:35:40,560
Tian Du is out of his mind again.

593
00:35:41,560 --> 00:35:43,560
He is not in his mind again.

594
00:35:43,560 --> 00:35:45,560
He is not in his mind again.

595
00:35:45,560 --> 00:35:47,560
He is not in his mind again.

596
00:35:47,560 --> 00:35:49,560
He is not in his mind again.

597
00:35:49,560 --> 00:35:51,560
He is not in his mind again.

598
00:35:51,560 --> 00:35:53,560
He is not in his mind again.

599
00:35:53,560 --> 00:35:55,560
He is not in his mind again.

600
00:35:55,560 --> 00:35:57,560
He is not in his mind again.

601
00:35:57,560 --> 00:35:59,560
He is not in his mind again.

602
00:35:59,560 --> 00:36:01,560
He is not in his mind again.

603
00:36:01,560 --> 00:36:03,560
He is not in his mind again.

604
00:36:03,560 --> 00:36:05,560
He is not in his mind again.

605
00:36:05,560 --> 00:36:07,560
He is not in his mind again.

606
00:36:07,560 --> 00:36:09,560
He is not in his mind again.

607
00:36:10,560 --> 00:36:12,560
He is not in his mind again.

608
00:36:24,560 --> 00:36:26,560
Where is Wenxiao?

609
00:36:27,560 --> 00:36:38,400
He is in

610
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:40,400
What do you want to say?

611
00:36:43,400 --> 00:36:48,400
You never let Wen Xiao and her alone be together before.

612
00:36:56,400 --> 00:36:59,400
Lord Zhuo, you are kind.

613
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:02,400
Don't let her down easily.

614
00:37:09,400 --> 00:37:12,400
Never let her down.

615
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:34,400
Have you done everything?

616
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:38,400
Have you already taught Feisijing the power of the scroll?

617
00:37:41,400 --> 00:37:43,400
It's your fault.

618
00:37:43,400 --> 00:37:45,400
You can't be so proud.

619
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:52,400
Feisijing will be in his position when he sees his face.

620
00:37:54,400 --> 00:38:00,400
It's time for them to know where Bai Ze Ling is.

621
00:38:01,400 --> 00:38:04,400
You don't think that monster will let them down?

622
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:07,400
That monster is really powerful.

623
00:38:07,400 --> 00:38:09,400
I'm also very bad.

624
00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:15,400
But I just want Zhao Yuanzhou to eat the scroll.

625
00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:21,400
Zhao Yuanzhou is really capable of Bai Ze Ling.

626
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:32,400
Bai Ze Ling is ....

627
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:34,400
Bai Eighteen

628
00:38:53,900 --> 00:38:55,400
The case arrived.

629
00:38:55,400 --> 00:38:57,300
It started two years ago,

630
00:38:57,300 --> 00:39:24,380
The two cardiac arrest

631
00:39:24,680 --> 00:39:25,960
I Holstein

632
00:39:25,960 --> 00:39:27,960
I have a reason.

633
00:39:27,960 --> 00:39:29,960
What?

634
00:39:43,960 --> 00:39:45,960
This is the first famous person to be born.

635
00:39:47,960 --> 00:39:49,960
No demon.

636
00:39:50,960 --> 00:39:52,960
I'm not good looking.

637
00:39:52,960 --> 00:39:53,960
You don't need to say.

638
00:39:53,960 --> 00:39:55,960
Yes, yes, yes.

639
00:39:55,960 --> 00:39:57,960
I'm afraid you're good looking.

640
00:40:00,960 --> 00:40:02,960
No blood.

641
00:40:03,960 --> 00:40:05,960
No fighting.

642
00:40:06,960 --> 00:40:08,960
It looks normal.

643
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:10,960
It's just not human.

644
00:40:11,960 --> 00:40:13,960
Too normal.

645
00:40:13,960 --> 00:40:15,960
It's not normal.

646
00:40:15,960 --> 00:40:19,960
Your demon of the Ice Tribe is very difficult to understand.

647
00:40:23,960 --> 00:40:25,960
Get out.

648
00:40:29,960 --> 00:40:31,960
No need.

649
00:40:33,960 --> 00:40:35,960
So afraid.

650
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:42,960
You don't want to go?

651
00:40:43,960 --> 00:40:45,960
I have a reason to see you.

652
00:40:45,960 --> 00:40:47,960
Last time in the Mirror Lake,

653
00:40:47,960 --> 00:40:50,960
I found that after the Cloud Sword sticks to your blood,

654
00:40:50,960 --> 00:40:52,960
it's very powerful.

655
00:40:54,960 --> 00:40:56,960
You don't want to go?

656
00:40:56,960 --> 00:40:58,960
No.

657
00:40:58,960 --> 00:41:00,960
I'm afraid you're not good looking.

658
00:41:00,960 --> 00:41:02,960
You don't want to go?

659
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:04,960
No.

660
00:41:04,960 --> 00:41:06,960
You don't want to go?

661
00:41:06,960 --> 00:41:08,960
No.

662
00:41:08,960 --> 00:41:10,960
You don't want to go?

663
00:41:10,960 --> 00:41:12,960
No.

664
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:14,960
You don't want to go?

665
00:41:14,960 --> 00:41:16,960
No.

666
00:41:16,960 --> 00:41:18,960
No.

667
00:41:18,960 --> 00:41:20,960
No.

668
00:41:20,960 --> 00:41:22,960
No.

669
00:41:23,960 --> 00:41:25,960
Wait, wait, wait.

670
00:41:27,960 --> 00:41:30,960
Why did you split up with me?

671
00:41:30,960 --> 00:41:32,960
You're making fun of me.

672
00:41:33,960 --> 00:41:35,960
What are you afraid of?

673
00:41:35,960 --> 00:41:37,960
I'm here.

674
00:41:37,960 --> 00:41:39,960
They don't want to play the game, do they?

675
00:41:39,960 --> 00:41:41,960
We're in their eyes.

676
00:41:41,960 --> 00:41:44,960
They're afraid of the evil.

677
00:41:47,960 --> 00:41:49,960
Aren't you half-dead?

678
00:41:49,960 --> 00:41:51,960
You're afraid of the devil, aren't you?

679
00:41:52,960 --> 00:41:54,960
What do you mean?

680
00:41:54,960 --> 00:41:56,960
I'm scolding you for being a pig.

681
00:41:59,960 --> 00:42:02,960
Xiaojue, you're getting more and more angry.

682
00:42:22,960 --> 00:42:24,960
There's no plum tree in the yard.

683
00:42:26,960 --> 00:42:28,960
Where did they get these flowers?

684
00:42:31,960 --> 00:42:33,960
They were still warm.

685
00:42:36,960 --> 00:42:38,960
That means...

686
00:42:52,960 --> 00:42:54,960
The murderer hasn't left.

687
00:43:22,960 --> 00:43:24,960
The murderer has left.

688
00:43:24,960 --> 00:43:26,960
The murderer has left.

689
00:43:26,960 --> 00:43:28,960
The murderer has left.

690
00:43:28,960 --> 00:43:30,960
The murderer has left.

691
00:43:30,960 --> 00:43:32,960
The murderer has left.

692
00:43:32,960 --> 00:43:34,960
The murderer has left.

693
00:43:34,960 --> 00:43:36,960
The murderer has left.

694
00:43:36,960 --> 00:43:38,960
The murderer has left.

695
00:43:38,960 --> 00:43:40,960
The murderer has left.

696
00:43:40,960 --> 00:43:42,960
The murderer has left.

697
00:43:42,960 --> 00:43:44,960
The murderer has left.

698
00:43:44,960 --> 00:43:46,960
The murderer has left.

699
00:43:46,960 --> 00:43:48,960
The murderer has left.

700
00:43:48,960 --> 00:43:50,960
The murderer has left.

701
00:43:51,760 --> 00:43:52,960
The murderer has left.

702
00:43:52,960 --> 00:43:54,960
The murderer has left.

703
00:43:54,960 --> 00:43:56,960
The murderer has left.

704
00:43:56,960 --> 00:43:58,960
The murderer has left.

705
00:43:58,960 --> 00:44:00,960
The murderer has left.

706
00:44:00,960 --> 00:44:02,960
The murderer has left .

707
00:44:02,960 --> 00:44:04,960
The murderer has left.

708
00:44:04,960 --> 00:44:06,960
The murderer has left.

709
00:44:06,960 --> 00:44:08,960
The murderer has left.

710
00:44:08,960 --> 00:44:10,960
The murderer has left.

711
00:44:10,960 --> 00:44:12,960
The murderer has left.

712
00:44:12,960 --> 00:44:14,960
The murderer has left.

713
00:44:14,960 --> 00:44:16,960
The murderer has left.

714
00:44:16,960 --> 00:44:18,960
I'm not sure if I can do it.

715
00:44:18,960 --> 00:44:20,960
I'm not sure if I can do it.

716
00:44:20,960 --> 00:44:22,960
I'm not sure if I can do it.

717
00:44:22,960 --> 00:44:24,960
I'm not sure if I can do it.

718
00:44:24,960 --> 00:44:26,960
I'm not sure if I can do it.

719
00:44:26,960 --> 00:44:28,960
I'm not sure if I can do it.

720
00:44:28,960 --> 00:44:30,960
I'm not sure if I can do it.

721
00:44:30,960 --> 00:44:32,960
I'm not sure if I can do it.

722
00:44:32,960 --> 00:44:34,960
I'm not sure if I can do it.

723
00:44:34,960 --> 00:44:36,960
I'm not sure if I can do it.

724
00:44:36,960 --> 00:44:38,960
I'm not sure if I can do it.

725

I'm not sure if I can do it.

726
00:44:40,960 --> 00:44:42,960
I'm not sure if I can do it.

727
00:44:42,960 --> 00:44:44,960
I'm not sure if I can do it.

728
00:44:44,960 --> 00:44:46,960
I'm not sure if I can do it.

729
