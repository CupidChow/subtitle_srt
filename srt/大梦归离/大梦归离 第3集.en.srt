It should have strong malicious energy.

The murderer must have absorbed the malicious energy.

154

So that demon's goal

155
00:13:52,300 --> 00:13:53,770
is to kill people

156
00:13:54,370 --> 00:13:56,130
and absorb malicious energy

157
00:13:56,500 --> 00:13:57,900
to increase its demonic power?

158
00:13:57,900 --> 00:14:00,830
If he just wanted malicious energy from dead people,

159
00:14:01,450 --> 00:14:02,850
why did he have to bring

160

all the brides' bodies here?

161

what he wants is brides.

168
00:14:20,910 --> 00:14:21,950

00:14:39,300 --> 00:14:40,360
and can do nothing.

177
00:14:42,140 --> 00:14:43,380
Well, well, well,

178
00:14:43,780 --> 00:14:45,380
you want to play it like this?

179
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:47,250
There are thousands of demons in the Wilderness.

180
00:14:47,250 --> 00:14:48,680
Why should I bother to remember

181
00:14:48,680 --> 00:14:50,310
an insignificant demon like this?

182
00:14:50,310 --> 00:14:52,610
To know what demon killed those people,

183
00:14:52,710 --> 00:14:55,440
we just need to find their bodies in the mortuary.

184
00:14:56,840 --> 00:14:58,570
I'll know after checking them.

185
00:15:00,410 --> 00:15:01,210
Let's go.

186
00:15:07,100 --> 00:15:07,880
Keep up.

187
00:15:08,420 --> 00:15:10,050
There's some more trouble

188
00:15:10,350 --> 00:15:11,960
I need to deal with.

189
00:15:14,680 --> 00:15:15,820
Mr. Zhuo.

190
00:15:16,020 --> 00:15:17,680
Go wait for me in the mortuary.

191
00:15:17,830 --> 00:15:19,020
Don't worry.

192
00:15:19,880 --> 00:15:21,240
Are you crazy?

193
00:15:25,260 --> 00:15:26,380

It's raining.

This is snow.

197

I'm a physician,

not a coroner.

00:15:58,830 --> 00:16:00,000
I can't do

200
00:16:00,030 --> 00:16:01,070
the autopsy.

201
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:03,740
The same thing.

202
00:16:03,760 --> 00:16:04,860
The same thing?

203
00:16:05,160 --> 00:16:06,630
Not at all!

204
00:16:06,710 --> 00:16:07,830
You're good at shooting.

205
00:16:07,830 --> 00:16:09,310
Can I say shooting is the same thing

206
00:16:09,310 --> 00:16:10,110
as cotton fluffing?

207
00:16:10,110 --> 00:16:10,970
I can't.

208
00:16:10,990 --> 00:16:13,610
Physicians and coroners are two different jobs.

209
00:16:13,610 --> 00:16:15,190
They're worlds apart.

I'll go to Mr. Zhuo to resign.

218

Why are there no corpses here?

The Chongwu Camp…

220
00:17:14,390 --> 00:17:16,270
The Chongwu Camp did it.

221
00:17:16,290 --> 00:17:18,589
They got rid of all the bodies in advance,

222
00:17:18,630 --> 00:17:20,030
destroying the evidence

223
00:17:20,040 --> 00:17:22,240
to stop us from investigating the case.

224
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:24,980
Those at the Chongwu Camp are so nice.

225

No one at the Chongwu Camp is good.

Where is Brother Zhuo?

He went to keep an eye on

228
00:17:33,180 --> 00:17:35,220
the next bride in danger.

229

burn some joss paper for them

rest in peace?

I don't want to be haunted.

But is he okay?

261

Why is there another wound?

262
00:19:59,330 --> 00:20:01,190
Isn't it supposed to heal itself?

263
00:20:03,030 --> 00:20:05,760
It's the Demon Slaying Arrow of the Chongwu Camp.

264
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:09,980
It's laced with a poison specifically designed to target demons.

265
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:18,380
It keeps the wound from healing

266
00:20:19,160 --> 00:20:20,420
and worsens the ulcer.

267
00:20:21,890 --> 00:20:22,910
It can't be cured.

268
00:20:24,560 --> 00:20:25,580

Fortunately, I was resourceful

272
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:34,860
and took a precious body from them.

Sir,

the vanguard squad of the Demon Hunting Bureau

has gone to the crime scene and the mortuary.

276

They also took a victim's body

277
00:20:46,160 --> 00:20:48,050
from the Chongwu Camp.

Yes.

281
00:20:55,860 --> 00:20:57,330
I heard that

282
00:20:57,360 --> 00:20:58,760
over a month ago,

283
00:20:59,150 --> 00:21:02,380
you paid a lot to hire a demon hunter from the Chongwu Camp.

284

Is that true?

285
00:21:09,510 --> 00:21:10,970
I can't find out anything.

286
00:21:16,570 --> 00:21:18,510
Judging from the bride's expression,

287
00:21:18,510 --> 00:21:20,310
it seems she was scared to death.

288
00:21:20,670 --> 00:21:22,810

What is this?

291
00:21:36,730 --> 00:21:38,730
The victim is holding it in her hand.

292
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:40,290
It looks like

293
00:21:40,390 --> 00:21:42,140
a demon's scale.

294
00:21:54,520 --> 00:21:57,290

You've gone too far.

to do an autopsy like a coroner.

302

you're being so nice to me.

00:22:52,460 --> 00:22:53,510
Are you going to ask me

318
00:22:53,510 --> 00:22:55,450
to do something scary again?

319
00:22:57,350 --> 00:22:58,280
Well,

320
00:22:58,620 --> 00:23:00,500
Little Bunny has a brain now?

321
00:23:05,130 --> 00:23:06,750
You don't eat anyway.

322
00:23:06,770 --> 00:23:08,950
Tell me about that demon.

323
00:23:10,510 --> 00:23:12,130
The victim has no wounds on her body

324
00:23:12,130 --> 00:23:13,620
but looks terrified.

325
00:23:13,710 --> 00:23:15,840
They were scared to death.

326
00:23:16,530 --> 00:23:17,830
In the Wilderness,

327
00:23:18,070 --> 00:23:19,910
a lot of demons

328
00:23:19,940 --> 00:23:21,060
can scare people to death.

329
00:23:21,060 --> 00:23:22,570
Say something we don't know.

330
00:23:22,570 --> 00:23:23,690
His name is Ran Yi.

331
00:23:25,820 --> 00:23:28,680
You didn't expect me to cut to the point so suddenly?

332
00:23:35,310 --> 00:23:36,230
Ran Yi?

333
00:23:38,150 --> 00:23:40,520
The demon whose flesh is said to be able to

334
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:41,810
help with sleep?

335
00:23:42,210 --> 00:23:44,810
He was born with the ability to control dreams.

336
00:23:45,300 --> 00:23:47,430
He can indeed make people fall asleep.

337
00:23:48,620 --> 00:23:49,880
He can control dreams?

338
00:23:50,570 --> 00:23:52,070
Can he make me have the dream

339
00:23:52,070 --> 00:23:53,770
of being the best physician every day

340
00:23:53,770 --> 00:23:54,930
and never wake up?

341
00:23:55,520 --> 00:23:58,040
Good dreams are the reflection of our wishes.

342
00:23:58,040 --> 00:23:59,280
They're good,

343
00:23:59,430 --> 00:24:01,110
but they're like the moon in the lake

344
00:24:01,110 --> 00:24:02,690
that disappears when you touch it.

345
00:24:02,690 --> 00:24:04,490
So don't get obsessed with them.

346
00:24:06,270 --> 00:24:07,070
Fine.

347
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:08,870
But most people

348
00:24:09,640 --> 00:24:11,770
in the world

349
00:24:11,920 --> 00:24:14,510
can never reach the real moon in their whole lives.

350
00:24:14,510 --> 00:24:16,140
For them,

351
00:24:17,190 --> 00:24:18,770
although the moon in the water

352
00:24:18,770 --> 00:24:20,040
is just an illusion,

353
00:24:21,070 --> 00:24:22,530
having it for just a moment

354
00:24:22,620 --> 00:24:24,280
can make them content enough.

355
00:24:24,750 --> 00:24:25,790
However,

356
00:24:26,160 --> 00:24:27,530
some people

357
00:24:27,640 --> 00:24:29,150
never rely on dreams.

358
00:24:30,010 --> 00:24:31,570
They're down-to-earth

359
00:24:31,870 --> 00:24:33,070
and work hard.

360
00:24:33,400 --> 00:24:34,240
For example…

361
00:24:34,270 --> 00:24:35,760
Mr. Zhuo.

362
00:24:36,530 --> 00:24:38,170
He never talks big

363
00:24:38,190 --> 00:24:39,540
and is a man of his word.

364
00:24:40,920 --> 00:24:42,790
Can't you see anyone else

365
00:24:42,790 --> 00:24:44,320
except for your role model?

366
00:24:48,010 --> 00:24:49,270
But it's true that Zhuo

367
00:24:49,630 --> 00:24:51,090
never has dreams.

368
00:24:51,220 --> 00:24:52,050
Really?

369
00:24:53,380 --> 00:24:54,570
That's strange.

370
00:24:55,420 --> 00:24:58,160
I've never heard of anyone who doesn't dream.

371
00:24:58,710 --> 00:25:01,310
Everyone wants to escape from certain things.

372
00:25:01,630 --> 00:25:02,830
At night,

373
00:25:02,850 --> 00:25:04,520
they hide in their dreams

374
00:25:05,170 --> 00:25:06,570
to catch their breath.

375
00:25:06,850 --> 00:25:08,580
That's human nature.

376
00:25:12,350 --> 00:25:13,570
I don't dare to sleep

377
00:25:14,920 --> 00:25:16,100
or dream.

378
00:25:17,060 --> 00:25:18,390
Whenever I fall asleep,

379
00:25:18,830 --> 00:25:20,570
I dream about

380
00:25:21,310 --> 00:25:22,780
becoming a demon.

381
00:25:25,790 --> 00:25:28,100
So Ran Yi is good at

382
00:25:28,550 --> 00:25:30,070
trapping people in dreams

383
00:25:30,510 --> 00:25:31,970
and scaring them to death.

384
00:25:32,760 --> 00:25:34,500
So Ran Yi

385
00:25:34,790 --> 00:25:36,390
gives people bad dreams

386
00:25:36,590 --> 00:25:37,790
instead of good ones?

387
00:25:40,070 --> 00:25:41,910
The record is wrong again.

388
00:25:46,700 --> 00:25:48,800
Then how can we deal with Ran Yi?

389
00:25:49,430 --> 00:25:51,940
You need to either have the Truth Eye

390
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:54,740
or

391
00:25:55,500 --> 00:25:58,200
cut off a piece of his flesh to eat.

392
00:26:02,830 --> 00:26:05,440
It's better to do it when he's alive.

393
00:26:05,980 --> 00:26:07,640
The flesh can have the best effect that way.

394
00:26:07,640 --> 00:26:09,500
You're the worst, Zhao Yuanzhou.

395
00:26:13,150 --> 00:26:13,940
By the way,

396
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:16,320
what is the Truth Eye you just mentioned?

397
00:26:16,350 --> 00:26:18,520
Why have I never read about it in books?

398
00:26:19,080 --> 00:26:19,870
It's something

399
00:26:19,870 --> 00:26:22,600
only the greatest demons in the Wilderness have.

400
00:26:23,240 --> 00:26:24,300
Forget about that.

401
00:26:24,550 --> 00:26:25,550
Focus on the case.

402
00:26:35,670 --> 00:26:36,660
Master,

403
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:39,860
Young Lady's wedding dress and dowry are ready.

404
00:26:44,100 --> 00:26:45,860
Then hurry up and get it done.

405
00:26:45,920 --> 00:26:47,710
Don't miss the auspicious day.

406
00:26:48,230 --> 00:26:49,430
But Master,

407
00:26:50,100 --> 00:26:52,620
what if the Water Ghost comes to take her away?

408
00:26:52,620 --> 00:26:54,910
I spent so much money raising her.

409
00:26:55,330 --> 00:26:57,140
She should be grateful.

410
00:26:57,960 --> 00:26:59,220
Even if she were to die,

411
00:26:59,410 --> 00:27:01,610
she should die on her way to get married.

412
00:27:01,650 --> 00:27:03,540
Once the wedding procession from Duke Zhen's Mansion

413
00:27:03,540 --> 00:27:05,350
takes her away from here,

414
00:27:06,280 --> 00:27:08,570
she has nothing to do with us.

415
00:27:09,580 --> 00:27:11,710
I just want to keep the betrothal gifts

416
00:27:11,950 --> 00:27:14,080
and let my son

417
00:27:14,120 --> 00:27:16,700
marry the daughter of the deputy prefect in style.

418
00:27:16,700 --> 00:27:17,780
But Master,

419
00:27:17,830 --> 00:27:18,820
after all, Young Lady...

420
00:27:18,820 --> 00:27:19,820
Enough!

421
00:28:05,640 --> 00:28:07,540
Now that we know the murderer is Ran Yi,

422
00:28:07,540 --> 00:28:08,980
let's go catch him.

423
00:28:09,630 --> 00:28:11,610
We signed the Military Order.

424
00:28:11,640 --> 00:28:13,840
Our heads are still hanging by a thread.

425
00:28:14,190 --> 00:28:15,930
I don't know where he is.

426
00:28:16,090 --> 00:28:17,220
How can we catch him?

427
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:18,750
With our minds?

428
00:28:19,850 --> 00:28:21,410
Both of you are demons.

429
00:28:21,470 --> 00:28:23,020
Can't you track his scent?

430
00:28:23,180 --> 00:28:24,980
Dogs track scents.

431
00:28:25,010 --> 00:28:26,050
Even dogs…

432
00:28:26,430 --> 00:28:27,890
are more capable than you.

433
00:28:29,690 --> 00:28:32,390
You said you'd help me find my brother.

434
00:28:32,570 --> 00:28:34,610
Were you just bragging too?

435
00:28:38,100 --> 00:28:39,120
Mr. Zhuo?

436
00:28:42,370 --> 00:28:44,180
I know how to find Ran Yi.

437
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:46,610
The one who's better than a dog is here.

438
00:28:50,270 --> 00:28:52,470
Miss Qi will get married in five days.

439
00:28:52,820 --> 00:28:54,370
Her wedding date hasn't been delayed.

440
00:28:54,370 --> 00:28:55,700
If we watch over Miss Qi,

441
00:28:55,720 --> 00:28:57,020
we can find Ran Yi.

442
00:29:00,060 --> 00:29:02,060
What's wrong with Master Qi?

443
00:29:02,100 --> 00:29:03,860
Marrying off her daughter now

444
00:29:03,880 --> 00:29:06,410
is sending her to be killed by the Water Ghost.

445
00:29:07,610 --> 00:29:08,530
Mr. Zhuo,

446
00:29:08,690 --> 00:29:10,820
you found something else, didn't you?

447
00:29:14,050 --> 00:29:15,190
Qi's Mansion

448
00:29:15,690 --> 00:29:17,880
is full of a strange smell.

449
00:29:21,470 --> 00:29:22,420
Strange smell?

450
00:29:24,660 --> 00:29:25,680
In the yard,

451
00:29:25,930 --> 00:29:28,460
there's the energy of demon-slaying spells.

452
00:29:32,940 --> 00:29:34,560
It's been eight years.

453
00:29:36,890 --> 00:29:38,530
Zhao Yuanzhou.

454
00:29:41,680 --> 00:29:45,660
Do you still remember your old friend?

455
00:29:46,710 --> 00:29:50,110
You've made so many new friends.

456
00:29:51,470 --> 00:29:54,630
Which one of them should I kill first?

457
00:30:03,270 --> 00:30:05,750
As usual,

458
00:30:06,910 --> 00:30:11,640
I'll start with Baize Goddess.

459
00:31:31,270 --> 00:31:32,070
Appear.

460
00:31:42,990 --> 00:31:43,790
Come out.

461
00:31:53,640 --> 00:31:55,410
Stop playing mysterious.

462
00:31:56,220 --> 00:31:57,380
Come to me now,

463
00:31:58,440 --> 00:32:01,150
or I'll set the lake ablaze

464
00:32:01,750 --> 00:32:03,270
and make you a fish soup.

465
00:32:36,820 --> 00:32:37,660
Kneel.

466
00:32:42,770 --> 00:32:45,030
Don't use your little tricks against me.

467
00:32:46,050 --> 00:32:48,330
The illusions you created

468
00:32:48,440 --> 00:32:50,530
can only deceive mortals.

469
00:32:51,430 --> 00:32:53,640
I know you have the Truth Eye.

470
00:32:53,660 --> 00:32:55,490
Of course I can't fool you.

471
00:32:59,150 --> 00:33:02,080
But it's not easy for other demons

472
00:33:03,590 --> 00:33:05,250
to see through the illusions.

473
00:33:32,600 --> 00:33:34,060
Even if you're just a fish,

474
00:33:34,840 --> 00:33:36,770
you still need to treat your wound.

475
00:33:50,140 --> 00:33:51,820
To get you this medicine,

476
00:33:52,800 --> 00:33:56,200
I had to pretend that I was hurt by the Demon Slaying Arrow too.

477
00:33:58,490 --> 00:34:00,270
Why is there another wound?

478
00:34:00,680 --> 00:34:02,830
That was so disgraceful for me.

479
00:34:06,680 --> 00:34:08,420
When will you

480
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:10,810
fulfill your promise to me?

481
00:34:15,230 --> 00:34:16,250
Don't worry.

482
00:34:19,969 --> 00:34:20,810
Soon.

483
00:34:22,790 --> 00:34:23,610
Master.

484
00:34:23,639 --> 00:34:27,040
Some officers from the Demon Hunting Bureau asked to see you.

485
00:34:27,850 --> 00:34:29,449
They're quick.

486
00:34:29,780 --> 00:34:31,550
You know what to do, don't you?

487
00:34:31,790 --> 00:34:32,590
Yes.

488
00:34:33,350 --> 00:34:34,469
I'll go meet them.

489
00:34:34,820 --> 00:34:36,260
Walk the general out

490
00:34:36,310 --> 00:34:37,570
through the back door.

491
00:34:37,800 --> 00:34:38,590
Lead the way.

492
00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:40,070
Please.

493
00:34:50,110 --> 00:34:50,909
Please.

494
00:35:18,080 --> 00:35:18,950
Lead the way.

495
00:35:21,110 --> 00:35:22,030
Coming.

496
00:35:33,390 --> 00:35:35,080
[Wedding Letter]

497
00:35:36,950 --> 00:35:38,070
Officers,

498
00:35:38,520 --> 00:35:41,050
this is the wedding letter left by the Water Ghost.

499
00:35:41,050 --> 00:35:42,070
See if you can

500
00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:44,040
find anything special about it.

501
00:35:44,900 --> 00:35:45,830
Wedding letter?

502
00:35:58,150 --> 00:35:59,230
Where is Miss Qi?

503
00:36:00,650 --> 00:36:02,320
She…

504
00:36:02,860 --> 00:36:03,710
My daughter

505
00:36:03,710 --> 00:36:04,950
was too frightened

506
00:36:04,950 --> 00:36:05,990
and caught a cold.

507
00:36:06,130 --> 00:36:08,080
She has been bedridden for days

508
00:36:08,110 --> 00:36:09,690
and can't see any visitors.

509
00:36:20,830 --> 00:36:22,230
There's demonic energy.

510
00:36:22,760 --> 00:36:24,420
Some demon is lurking around.

511
00:36:24,870 --> 00:36:26,000
The wedding letter

512
00:36:26,020 --> 00:36:27,970
has strong demonic energy left on it.

513
00:36:27,970 --> 00:36:29,270
Mr. Qi,

514
00:36:29,750 --> 00:36:30,990
have you set up a formation

515
00:36:30,990 --> 00:36:33,160
in your mansion to kill demons?

516
00:36:33,810 --> 00:36:35,280
To be honest, officers,

517
00:36:35,750 --> 00:36:37,630
the whole household is in a panic.

518
00:36:37,660 --> 00:36:38,270
So

519
00:36:38,330 --> 00:36:40,240
I asked someone to set up a formation

520
00:36:40,240 --> 00:36:41,630
to calm them down.

521
00:36:42,720 --> 00:36:44,760
Before the Water Ghost case,

522
00:36:45,280 --> 00:36:47,330
was there anything unusual in the mansion?

523
00:36:47,330 --> 00:36:48,730
We lived a peaceful life.

524
00:36:49,230 --> 00:36:50,640
Nothing unusual.

525
00:36:52,370 --> 00:36:53,670
Mr. Qi.

526
00:36:54,310 --> 00:36:56,360
If you really want to save your daughter,

527
00:36:56,360 --> 00:36:58,620
you need to be honest with us

528
00:36:58,650 --> 00:36:59,780
and hide no secrets.

529
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:00,600
Of course.

530
00:37:01,720 --> 00:37:03,020
Please

531
00:37:03,250 --> 00:37:04,860
save my daughter.

532
00:37:08,500 --> 00:37:09,450
[God of Happiness]

533
00:37:15,230 --> 00:37:17,160
Something's wrong with Master Qi.

534
00:37:18,390 --> 00:37:19,610
The case file doesn't mention

535
00:37:19,610 --> 00:37:22,580
anything about the wedding letter from the Water Ghost.

536
00:37:22,580 --> 00:37:23,380
No.

537
00:37:23,930 --> 00:37:25,620
Only Miss Qi received it.

538
00:37:26,220 --> 00:37:27,780
It seems that Miss Qi

539
00:37:27,810 --> 00:37:30,140
is the key to solving the Water Ghost case.

540
00:37:31,340 --> 00:37:33,350
But we can't see her.

541
00:37:36,920 --> 00:37:37,520
Hey.

542
00:37:38,230 --> 00:37:40,520
The Qi family is really unlucky.

543
00:37:40,550 --> 00:37:42,930
It was supposed to be great that Miss Qi was getting married,

544
00:37:42,930 --> 00:37:44,850
but such a misfortune befell her.

545
00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:45,690
Exactly.

546
00:37:45,710 --> 00:37:46,790
Over the past month,

547
00:37:46,790 --> 00:37:47,910
a lot of things happened in the mansion.

548
00:37:47,910 --> 00:37:49,350
No one knows why.

549
00:37:49,970 --> 00:37:51,100
Over the past month?

550
00:37:52,240 --> 00:37:53,980
What happened before?

551
00:37:54,780 --> 00:37:55,950
Nothing.

552
00:37:55,980 --> 00:37:57,340
I know nothing.

553
00:38:00,660 --> 00:38:03,430
I-I really don't know.

554
00:38:03,470 --> 00:38:05,910
He has a bad temper,

555
00:38:05,940 --> 00:38:07,390
not easy to deal with.

556
00:38:08,830 --> 00:38:10,990
I-I really don't know.

557
00:38:11,860 --> 00:38:12,610
Tell us.

558
00:38:14,760 --> 00:38:15,470
I only know

559
00:38:15,470 --> 00:38:17,070
a month ago, Master secretly

560
00:38:17,070 --> 00:38:19,090
hired a demon hunter from the Chongwu Camp

561
00:38:19,090 --> 00:38:20,940
and forbade us from telling anyone about it.

562
00:38:20,940 --> 00:38:21,500
As for

563
00:38:21,520 --> 00:38:22,410
the reason,

564
00:38:22,440 --> 00:38:23,880
I-I really don't know.

565
00:38:24,080 --> 00:38:24,940
Anything else?

566
00:38:24,940 --> 00:38:25,890
No.

567
00:38:25,920 --> 00:38:27,630
That's all I know.

568
00:38:28,220 --> 00:38:29,750
As early as over a month ago,

569
00:38:29,750 --> 00:38:31,880
Master Qi hired a demon hunter.

570
00:38:33,470 --> 00:38:34,590
But Ran Yi's wedding letter

571
00:38:34,590 --> 00:38:35,620
has just arrived.

572
00:38:39,030 --> 00:38:39,980
Do you know

573
00:38:40,090 --> 00:38:41,550
where the demon hunter is?

574
00:38:43,640 --> 00:38:44,520
I know.

575
00:39:02,870 --> 00:39:03,840
Master.

576
00:39:04,230 --> 00:39:05,760
As you ordered,

577
00:39:05,960 --> 00:39:07,260
I've told them

578
00:39:07,290 --> 00:39:08,960
that you hired a demon hunter

579
00:39:08,990 --> 00:39:10,350
over a month ago.

580
00:39:10,780 --> 00:39:12,030
Did you tell them

581
00:39:12,270 --> 00:39:13,830
where the demon hunter is?

582
00:39:14,110 --> 00:39:14,790
I did.

583
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:16,060
If nothing happens,

584
00:39:16,120 --> 00:39:17,610
they should have set off.

585
00:39:29,550 --> 00:39:29,990
Hey.

586
00:39:30,030 --> 00:39:30,720
Great Demon.

587
00:39:30,720 --> 00:39:32,920
Why isn't there any task assigned to me?

588
00:39:33,480 --> 00:39:34,540
Of course there is.

589
00:39:35,090 --> 00:39:37,010
Your task is to stay away from the battlefield.

590
00:39:37,010 --> 00:39:38,540
Don't cause us any trouble.

591
00:39:39,540 --> 00:39:41,210
Why aren't you catching the demon?

592
00:39:41,210 --> 00:39:43,580
You let Brother Zhuo and Sister Pei do all the work

593
00:39:43,580 --> 00:39:45,110
while you idle around here.

594
00:39:46,560 --> 00:39:48,820
Why are you scolding Wen Xiao so harshly?

595
00:39:50,510 --> 00:39:51,240
I…

596
00:39:54,310 --> 00:39:55,280
Wen.

597
00:39:55,310 --> 00:39:56,630
He's trying to sow discord between us.

598
00:39:56,630 --> 00:39:57,810
Don't fall for it.

599
00:39:59,610 --> 00:40:01,020
We're waiting,

600
00:40:01,050 --> 00:40:02,340
not idling around.

601
00:40:02,540 --> 00:40:04,610
If the demon tries to escape,

602
00:40:04,630 --> 00:40:06,350
this is his only way out.

603
00:40:06,580 --> 00:40:08,740
We just need to wait for him to show up.

604
00:40:09,100 --> 00:40:09,580
Okay.

605
00:40:10,740 --> 00:40:11,450
Humph!

606
00:40:24,030 --> 00:40:25,510
Do the demons in the Wilderness

607
00:40:25,510 --> 00:40:26,710
only drink water

608
00:40:26,710 --> 00:40:27,990
and not eat?

609
00:40:29,250 --> 00:40:31,110
We don't even have to drink water.

610
00:40:39,060 --> 00:40:40,390
Low-maintenance pets.

611
00:40:41,080 --> 00:40:42,840
Then do you want to have one?

612
00:40:43,560 --> 00:40:45,030
Since I was young,

613
00:40:45,070 --> 00:40:46,470
every pet I kept has died.

614
00:40:47,460 --> 00:40:48,950
That's very tempting.

615
00:40:55,110 --> 00:40:57,060
Since you don't need water,

616
00:40:57,080 --> 00:40:59,180
why are you always holding a bottle?

617
00:41:02,260 --> 00:41:03,860
It serves a special purpose?

618
00:41:06,520 --> 00:41:07,520
Zhao Yuanzhou.

619
00:41:07,640 --> 00:41:08,710
I've always suspected

620
00:41:08,710 --> 00:41:10,370
what's in your bottle is wine,

621
00:41:10,530 --> 00:41:12,190
but I have no evidence.

622
00:41:13,410 --> 00:41:14,660
It's indeed water.

623
00:41:14,840 --> 00:41:16,400
I simply like drinking water.

624
00:41:16,400 --> 00:41:17,510
Just like some tree demons

625
00:41:17,510 --> 00:41:19,280
like sunbathing.

626
00:41:19,670 --> 00:41:21,180
What kind of water is it?

627
00:41:23,560 --> 00:41:25,490
You want to get something out of me?

628
00:41:26,410 --> 00:41:27,430
As your colleague,

629
00:41:27,430 --> 00:41:29,750
I just want to know more about you.

630
00:41:30,200 --> 00:41:32,460
I advise you not to.

631
00:41:34,240 --> 00:41:34,990
Why?

632
00:41:36,420 --> 00:41:38,340
Because the more you know about me,

633
00:41:38,340 --> 00:41:39,100
the more…

634
00:41:39,550 --> 00:41:40,720
Dangerous!

635
00:41:42,220 --> 00:41:44,320
Run, run!

636
00:41:54,820 --> 00:41:56,880
If you want to catch up,

637
00:41:58,760 --> 00:42:00,070
come with me.

638
00:42:03,260 --> 00:42:04,230
Wen Xiao!

639
00:42:04,620 --> 00:42:05,420
Stay hidden!

640
00:42:42,020 --> 00:42:43,350
What are you doing here?

641
00:42:47,560 --> 00:42:49,210
He'd have run away if I hadn't come.

642
00:42:49,210 --> 00:42:50,970
Do you think I'll let him run away?

643
00:42:50,970 --> 00:42:52,490
Open your eyes.

644
00:42:53,410 --> 00:42:54,270
Don't kill him!

645
00:43:27,360 --> 00:43:28,410
Li Lun.

646
00:43:29,840 --> 00:43:32,240
You're playing that parasitic game again.

647
00:43:32,460 --> 00:43:34,150
You're not used to not having

648
00:43:35,280 --> 00:43:37,110
your Truth Eye, are you?

649
00:43:39,550 --> 00:43:40,800
Li Lun?

650
00:43:45,200 --> 00:43:47,680
Li Lun, who killed my master.

651
00:43:52,870 --> 00:43:53,530
Li Lun,

652
00:43:53,700 --> 00:43:54,770
do you admit your crimes?

653
00:43:54,770 --> 00:43:56,120
Zhao Wan'er,

654
00:43:56,660 --> 00:43:59,080
you're just a mortal.

655
00:43:59,750 --> 00:44:02,600
Who are you to interfere in the affairs of the Wilderness?

656
00:44:02,600 --> 00:44:04,500
I'm from the Baize bloodline,

657
00:44:05,410 --> 00:44:07,740
so it's my duty to protect the Wilderness.

658
00:44:07,790 --> 00:44:09,010
Of course I have to intervene.

659
00:44:09,010 --> 00:44:10,950
Then I'll kill you.

660
00:44:11,510 --> 00:44:13,570
Let's see how you can intervene then.

661
00:44:14,940 --> 00:44:15,850
Master!

662
00:44:23,390 --> 00:44:24,460
Master!

663
00:44:29,350 --> 00:44:30,370
Master.

664
00:44:32,400 --> 00:44:33,520
Master!

665
00:44:52,380 --> 00:44:54,310
She's close to remembering it.

666
00:44:56,010 --> 00:44:57,100
How about

667
00:44:58,770 --> 00:44:59,860
I help her?

668
00:45:47,230 --> 00:45:48,300
Wen Xiao!

669
00:45:52,270 --> 00:45:53,190
How about now?

670
00:45:54,630 --> 00:45:56,680
Do you remember everything?
