3
00:01:51,030 --> 00:01:52,190
Sister Pei!

4
00:01:54,270 --> 00:01:55,240
Sister Pei!

5
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:57,370
Sister Pei!

6
00:01:58,190 --> 00:01:59,130
Sister Pei?

7
00:02:02,710 --> 00:02:03,760
Sister Pei?

8
00:02:04,270 --> 00:02:05,290
Sister Pei?

9
00:02:15,910 --> 00:02:16,880
Jiu.

10
00:02:29,090 --> 00:02:29,650
Where's Heng?

11
00:04:26,350 --> 00:04:27,270
Sister.

12
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:31,760
You finally succeeded.

13
00:04:39,230 --> 00:04:40,390
Unfortunately,

14
00:04:42,270 --> 00:04:44,670
I can't be with you anymore.

15
00:04:48,950 --> 00:04:50,110
This time,

16
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:53,720
I'm really leaving.

17
00:04:58,650 --> 00:04:59,850
I'm happy

18
00:05:00,930 --> 00:05:02,910
that I'm no longer your burden.

19
00:05:05,070 --> 00:05:07,270
I've become your armor.

20
00:05:10,790 --> 00:05:11,720
But...

21
00:05:13,340 --> 00:05:14,580
But what?

22
00:05:16,900 --> 00:05:17,910
Nothing.

23
00:05:22,610 --> 00:05:24,360
But the fate of the armor

24
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:26,310
is destined to break.

25
00:05:27,230 --> 00:05:28,960
Just like how the fate of snow

26
00:05:29,830 --> 00:05:31,240
is destined to melt.

27
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:36,860
♫An arrow in the hand♫

28
00:05:37,330 --> 00:05:39,620
♫A string in the heart♫

29
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:45,490
♫A backside standing, turning into forever♫

30
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:41,710
This is

31
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:46,090
my last time

32
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:48,100
♫The moon shines on the south♫

33
00:05:47,250 --> 00:05:48,930
protecting you.

34
00:05:48,670 --> 00:05:51,050
♫But I look north♫

35
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:56,560
♫I only hope the snow comes a bit later♫

36
00:05:56,920 --> 00:05:57,510
You

37
00:05:56,990 --> 00:05:59,370
♫Intimately bound together in the cold world♫

38
00:05:58,550 --> 00:05:59,930
must...

39
00:05:59,430 --> 00:06:02,170
♫Even death can't break our ties♫

40
00:06:02,220 --> 00:06:05,470
♫Like intertwined fates, debt, love, and hatred♫

41
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:07,610
live on well.

42
00:06:05,530 --> 00:06:08,050
♫Reluctant but with no resentment♫

43
00:06:08,350 --> 00:06:13,690
♫Only half of the bows and arrows remain♫

44
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:11,000
Don't leave me.

45
00:06:13,190 --> 00:06:16,050
Don't leave me alone.

46
00:06:13,990 --> 00:06:19,200
♫Night and dawn are forever kept apart♫

47
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:20,100
Heng.

48
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:21,770
♫If you were a spring night♫

49
00:06:21,830 --> 00:06:24,500
♫I'm the silent mountain♫

50
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:27,520
♫You're a sad firefly♫

51
00:06:27,590 --> 00:06:30,280
♫Guarding the last moment of the night♫

52
00:06:30,470 --> 00:06:33,140
♫Why don't you remember♫

53
00:06:33,230 --> 00:06:35,920
♫I'm always by your side?♫

54
00:06:35,980 --> 00:06:37,840
♫Like wind surrounding flowers♫

55
00:06:37,860 --> 00:06:40,460
♫Guarding the memories♫

56
00:06:40,659 --> 00:06:44,700
♫Never fading away♫

57

Heng.

58

Pei Siheng!

59

♫Lend me the cold lamp for one night♫

60
00:06:52,150 --> 00:06:53,480
Heng!

61
00:06:54,640 --> 00:06:59,690
♫Let regret stay before dawn♫

62
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:02,190
♫Turns out I'm a wanderer♫

63
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:05,040
♫And you're a song of reluctant parting♫

64
00:07:05,090 --> 00:07:08,210
♫In the sky of floating snowflakes♫

65
00:07:08,290 --> 00:07:10,830
♫You are the only warm bloom♫

66
00:07:10,900 --> 00:07:13,620
♫But why don't I remember♫

67
00:07:13,670 --> 00:07:16,400
♫How much the plot has twisted?♫

68
00:07:16,780 --> 00:07:18,500
♫I forgot the bitter karma♫

69
00:07:18,550 --> 00:07:21,200
♫I missed it again and again♫

70
00:07:21,250 --> 00:07:24,820
♫Helpless♫

71
00:07:25,020 --> 00:07:27,500
♫Turns out I'm a wanderer♫

72
00:07:27,540 --> 00:07:30,340
♫And you're a song of reluctant parting♫

73
00:07:30,750 --> 00:07:33,430
♫I'm a black-and-white wound♫

74
00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:36,140
♫You're the vibrant red color♫

75
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:39,090
♫How can I not remember♫

76
00:07:39,130 --> 00:07:41,830
♫You're always by my side?♫

77
00:07:41,900 --> 00:07:43,680
♫Like wind surrounding flowers♫

♫Never fading away♫

80
00:08:56,560 --> 00:08:58,280
I have a way to deal with him.

81
00:08:58,520 --> 00:08:59,820
What is it?

82
00:09:00,860 --> 00:09:02,900
My true form is the pagoda tree.

83
00:09:04,390 --> 00:09:06,560
I'm restricted by the Ever-Burning Wood,

84
00:09:08,010 --> 00:09:09,660
but at the same time,

85
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:12,090
I can attract the fire.

86
00:09:17,010 --> 00:09:19,050
I'll attract the fire of Wen Zongyu's

87
00:09:19,110 --> 00:09:20,580
Ever-Burning Wood

88
00:09:20,910 --> 00:09:22,760
to weaken his demonic power.

89
00:09:22,780 --> 00:09:25,050
You take the chance to destroy his inner core.

90
00:09:26,630 --> 00:09:28,400
He will definitely die.

91
00:09:29,110 --> 00:09:30,190
But...

92
00:09:30,910 --> 00:09:32,750
But this way, you will die too.

93
00:09:38,650 --> 00:09:39,650
Li Lun.

94
00:09:39,740 --> 00:09:40,880
What are you doing?

95
00:09:40,900 --> 00:09:43,080
I'll give you half of my demonic power.

96
00:09:48,170 --> 00:09:51,070
With the demonic powers of the pagoda ghost and Bingyi together,

97
00:09:53,590 --> 00:09:56,010
Wen Zongyu can't put up a fight.

98
00:10:00,920 --> 00:10:02,290
Zhuo Yichen.

99
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:06,640
I'll leave it to you.

100
00:10:07,010 --> 00:10:08,510
Don't let me down.

101
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:13,650
Since we were born,

102
00:10:15,640 --> 00:10:17,160
he and I

103
00:10:18,050 --> 00:10:20,340
were equal

104
00:10:21,160 --> 00:10:22,720
and always tied in a fight.

105
00:10:28,680 --> 00:10:31,210
I can't stand seeing him so useless.

106
00:10:51,350 --> 00:10:52,420
Zhu Yan.

107
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:55,560
I'll give you

108
00:10:58,990 --> 00:11:00,190
the remaining half.

109
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:28,980
This is...

110
00:12:31,630 --> 00:12:32,990
The Truth Eye.

111
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:46,620
♫The world is vast; life is like the sea♫

112
00:12:47,290 --> 00:12:49,750
♫I exist♫

113
00:12:48,030 --> 00:12:49,340
These eyes

114
00:12:49,850 --> 00:12:53,730
♫In the black and white between day and night♫

115
00:12:50,960 --> 00:12:52,470
were not mine anyway.

116
00:12:53,820 --> 00:12:56,180
♫Time never stops♫

117
00:12:56,250 --> 00:12:57,740
♫Mountains and waters come♫

118
00:12:57,830 --> 00:12:59,090
♫It's hard for thousands of boats to carry♫

119
00:12:59,190 --> 00:13:00,670
♫The lineage of Lingxi♫

120
00:13:00,700 --> 00:13:02,760
♫Outside the world♫

121
00:13:02,830 --> 00:13:06,740
♫Waiting in a grand dream♫

122
00:13:06,820 --> 00:13:13,710
♫Laugh at the chaotic world's illusion, like flowers in the mirror and moonlight on water♫

123
00:13:10,710 --> 00:13:12,040
Now, they're yours.

124
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:20,090
♫Can't let go and turn back, the sea of ​​suffering is endless♫

125
00:13:15,190 --> 00:13:18,030
I hope you can see the world clearly.

126
00:13:20,130 --> 00:13:27,090
♫Without worries, the dark night brings me home♫

127
00:13:23,770 --> 00:13:25,640
Don't be like me.

128
00:13:27,140 --> 00:13:33,400
♫Don't fear; will the starlight remember me?♫

129
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:38,850
Li Lun!

130
00:13:40,110 --> 00:13:41,390
I once vowed...

131
00:13:41,410 --> 00:13:42,060
Li Lun!

132
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:44,640
To protect the Wilderness

133
00:13:44,760 --> 00:13:46,450
until my death.

134
00:13:48,060 --> 00:13:49,720
I, Li Lun,

135
00:13:49,870 --> 00:13:51,440
live up to my vow

136
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:53,680
and keep my promise.

137
00:13:56,350 --> 00:13:57,710
Zhuo Yichen!

138
00:14:00,510 --> 00:14:02,430
Look carefully.

139
00:14:02,790 --> 00:14:04,740
Don't miss!

140
00:15:24,690 --> 00:15:26,320
Wen Zongyu,

141
00:15:26,340 --> 00:15:28,430
we've done too many wrong things.

142
00:15:28,920 --> 00:15:30,160
So...

143
00:15:31,180 --> 00:15:33,080
let's die together!

144
00:15:42,490 --> 00:15:43,510
Zhuo!

145
00:16:13,430 --> 00:16:14,220
Wing.

146
00:18:46,630 --> 00:18:48,150
Dharma.

147
00:18:48,440 --> 00:18:49,620
Return!

148
00:19:08,630 --> 00:19:10,360
See through

149
00:19:10,510 --> 00:19:12,540
all illusions!

150
00:22:01,680 --> 00:22:02,690
Jiu.

151
00:22:03,350 --> 00:22:04,890
You can't go there

152
00:22:05,150 --> 00:22:06,280
when Sir isn't here.

153
00:22:06,800 --> 00:22:08,810
There's a strong barrier here.

154
00:22:08,830 --> 00:22:10,010
You'll get hurt.

155
00:22:10,650 --> 00:22:12,800
Why is a barrier set here?

156
00:22:12,830 --> 00:22:14,240
To protect something?

157
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:16,190
He didn't say it.

158
00:22:17,190 --> 00:22:19,150
But it must be very important.

159
00:22:32,140 --> 00:22:33,410
Zhao Yuanzhou.

160
00:22:33,580 --> 00:22:36,390
Do you really think you defeated me?

161
00:22:41,860 --> 00:22:43,610
Like a phoenix rising from the ashes,

162
00:22:43,710 --> 00:22:46,130
I can be reborn countless times

163
00:22:46,160 --> 00:22:48,060
from the Ever-Burning Wood's ashes.

164
00:23:09,290 --> 00:23:11,090
I was right.

165
00:23:11,730 --> 00:23:15,410
The phoenix will be reborn

166
00:23:15,750 --> 00:23:17,450
from the Ever-Burning Wood's ashes.

167
00:23:18,920 --> 00:23:20,090
Jiu,

168
00:23:21,050 --> 00:23:22,240
go!

169
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:24,290
Sir

170
00:23:24,450 --> 00:23:25,620
is now

171
00:23:25,650 --> 00:23:27,200
immortal.

172
00:23:29,920 --> 00:23:30,950
He can

173
00:23:30,980 --> 00:23:33,450
eternally be reborn

174
00:23:33,480 --> 00:23:36,070
from the Ever-Burning Wood's ashes.

175
00:23:36,200 --> 00:23:38,350
You can't defeat him.

176
00:23:38,460 --> 00:23:40,190
Go.

177
00:23:40,630 --> 00:23:42,450
Zhao Yuanzhou.

178
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:43,800
Zhuo!

179
00:23:47,950 --> 00:23:48,760
Zhuo!

180
00:23:52,810 --> 00:23:54,440
Such a powerful barrier.

181
00:23:55,610 --> 00:23:58,460
It must be used to protect the ashes for rebirth.

182
00:24:09,310 --> 00:24:10,030
Jiu,

183
00:24:10,180 --> 00:24:11,300
go!

184
00:24:11,850 --> 00:24:12,970
This time...

185
00:24:17,030 --> 00:24:18,590
I must accomplish it.

186
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:17,200
Zhao Yuanzhou.

187
00:26:17,860 --> 00:26:21,330
This barrier can block my body,

188
00:26:22,360 --> 00:26:24,450
but it can't block demonic power.

189
00:26:24,590 --> 00:26:26,880
I'll give you all my and Li Lun's power.

190
00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:30,180
Before he regains his power completely,

191
00:26:30,700 --> 00:26:32,820
destroy

192
00:26:33,280 --> 00:26:34,050
this barrier!

193
00:27:33,740 --> 00:27:34,880
Zhao Yuanzhou,

194
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:37,000
if you destroy this barrier,

195
00:27:37,320 --> 00:27:39,070
he and I will both die.

196
00:27:53,870 --> 00:27:54,950
Zhao Yuanzhou,

197
00:27:56,120 --> 00:27:57,640
do it!

198
00:28:00,010 --> 00:28:01,740
But you're still inside.

199
00:28:03,340 --> 00:28:04,810
Ignore me.

200
00:28:06,040 --> 00:28:08,000
Your One-Word Spell

201
00:28:08,040 --> 00:28:09,350
has no effect on me.

202
00:28:14,490 --> 00:28:15,050
Hurry.

203
00:28:23,410 --> 00:28:24,130
Wing.

204
00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:32,990
No.

205
00:28:34,190 --> 00:28:35,230
No.

206
00:28:37,080 --> 00:28:38,400
Why is it like this?

207
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:43,940
Zhao Yuanzhou!

208
00:28:45,430 --> 00:28:46,360
Hurry.

209
00:28:46,610 --> 00:28:48,520
The One-Word Spell is effective on you.

210
00:28:50,140 --> 00:28:51,440
You will die too.

211
00:29:56,550 --> 00:29:57,510
If I can't

212
00:30:00,110 --> 00:30:02,190
protect you anymore,

213
00:30:04,490 --> 00:30:06,840
you have to learn to protect yourself.

214
00:30:08,400 --> 00:30:09,360
Understand?

215
00:30:11,630 --> 00:30:12,950
I know.

216
00:30:25,750 --> 00:30:27,140
Brother Zhuo,

217
00:30:27,560 --> 00:30:28,960
this time,

218
00:30:29,370 --> 00:30:31,200
let me protect you!

219
00:31:06,910 --> 00:31:08,540
Brother Zhuo!

220
00:31:12,510 --> 00:31:13,860
Brother Zhuo!

221
00:31:22,280 --> 00:31:23,830
Brother Zhuo!

222
00:31:30,140 --> 00:31:36,190
♫Someday I'll return to my old hometown♫

223
00:31:37,010 --> 00:31:43,080
♫Wearing old clothes but with eyes shining bright♫

224
00:31:43,970 --> 00:31:45,960
♫Holding brilliance in the right hand♫

225
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:47,790
♫Biting down on all panic♫

226
00:31:47,880 --> 00:31:49,360
♫Wiping away frost with the left hand♫

227
00:31:49,400 --> 00:31:51,200
♫I finally look up♫

228
00:31:51,240 --> 00:31:54,090
♫You're in front of me♫

229
00:31:55,040 --> 00:31:57,230
♫Blocking the pain♫

230
00:31:57,920 --> 00:32:01,240
♫Who cries with swollen eyes?♫

231
00:32:01,860 --> 00:32:04,710
♫With a broken heart♫

232
00:32:04,900 --> 00:32:07,740
♫Walking, stopping♫

233
00:32:06,310 --> 00:32:09,140
Brother Zhuo!

234
00:32:07,790 --> 00:32:10,700
♫Chasing your voice♫

235
00:32:11,240 --> 00:32:14,890
♫I'll turn into raindrops♫

236
00:32:15,170 --> 00:32:17,840
♫An ancient song♫

237
00:32:18,160 --> 00:32:21,030
♫Running towards you♫

238
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:24,360
♫Looking for you♫

239
00:32:25,470 --> 00:32:28,340
♫The summer cicadas also hear♫

240
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:32,000
♫The winter snow also hears♫

241
00:32:32,330 --> 00:32:34,970
♫In a sea of people♫

242
00:32:35,290 --> 00:32:38,320
♫I'm holding a small wind chime♫

243
00:32:38,750 --> 00:32:42,210
♫I finally heard the wind say♫

244
00:32:42,550 --> 00:32:45,490
♫Knowing where you are♫

245
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:48,550
♫It'll lead me♫

246
00:32:48,980 --> 00:32:51,890
♫To find you♫

247
00:32:52,440 --> 00:32:55,090
♫Find you♫

248
00:32:57,250 --> 00:32:58,600
Do it!

249
00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:01,970
♫Find you♫

250
00:33:01,910 --> 00:33:03,680
Zhao Yuanzhou!

251
00:33:17,070 --> 00:33:19,170
Brother Zhuo!

252
00:33:41,590 --> 00:33:43,960
Brother Zhuo!

253
00:33:55,230 --> 00:33:56,190
Break!

254
00:36:07,240 --> 00:36:08,360
Zhuo.

255
00:36:30,280 --> 00:36:31,270
Why?

256
00:36:32,760 --> 00:36:34,630
Why does my One-Word Spell

257
00:36:35,190 --> 00:36:36,870
not work on you anymore?

258
00:36:44,770 --> 00:36:45,990
I don't understand.

259
00:36:49,520 --> 00:36:51,040
Maybe the heavens think

260
00:36:51,640 --> 00:36:53,330
I didn't do

261
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:57,470
what I promised you.

262
00:37:24,350 --> 00:37:25,230
If

263
00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:29,510
the phoenix rebirth Wen Zongyu said is true,

264
00:37:32,240 --> 00:37:34,090
will he be reborn again?

265
00:37:36,270 --> 00:37:37,470
Someone must have

266
00:37:39,280 --> 00:37:41,240
destroyed the Ever-Burning Wood ashes

267
00:37:41,270 --> 00:37:42,870
that he needs

268
00:37:43,580 --> 00:37:44,710
to be reborn.

269
00:37:49,280 --> 00:37:50,640
Who could it be?

270
00:37:57,200 --> 00:37:59,490
Maybe someone who knows him well enough

271
00:38:01,840 --> 00:38:03,210
to think of this.

272
00:38:03,510 --> 00:38:04,600
It's Jiu.

273
00:38:36,470 --> 00:38:37,590
Mr. Zhuo,

274
00:38:39,310 --> 00:38:40,530
goodbye.

275
00:38:48,830 --> 00:38:50,100
This feather

276
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:52,960
can bring you to Jiu's side.

277
00:38:53,710 --> 00:38:54,590
Go!

278
00:38:55,290 --> 00:38:57,050
I'll wait for you at the Demon Hunting Bureau.
