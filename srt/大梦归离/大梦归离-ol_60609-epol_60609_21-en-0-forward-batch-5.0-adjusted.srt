00:01:48,130 --> 00:01:50,900
[Episode 21]

3
00:02:00,860 --> 00:02:02,050
Situ Ming,

4
00:02:02,670 --> 00:02:04,250
you hid a criminal.

5
00:02:04,780 --> 00:02:06,130
Do you admit your crime?

6
00:02:21,430 --> 00:02:23,230
I wanted to catch Zhao Yuanzhou,

7
00:02:23,290 --> 00:02:25,220
but I found something unexpected.

8
00:02:30,550 --> 00:02:31,800
Zhao Yuanzhou,

9
00:02:31,870 --> 00:02:32,870
no matter where you hide,

10
00:02:32,870 --> 00:02:34,310
it's all in vain.

11
00:02:35,579 --> 00:02:37,550
You underestimate the demon energy tracking spell

12
00:02:37,550 --> 00:02:39,150
of the Chongwu Camp.

13
00:02:42,110 --> 00:02:43,120
Indeed.

14
00:02:43,460 --> 00:02:44,800
You are truly dogs.

15
00:02:48,950 --> 00:02:50,310
Still throwing insults

16
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:52,220
when you're facing death?

17
00:02:57,950 --> 00:02:59,400
Useless.

18
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:02,710
Stop, Master!

19
00:03:02,710 --> 00:03:03,390
Jiu!

20
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:06,550
I won't allow you to hurt my friends.

21
00:03:20,970 --> 00:03:21,920
Bai Jiu,

22
00:03:22,550 --> 00:03:24,550
since you still call me Master,

23
00:03:25,970 --> 00:03:27,990
shouldn't you repay me

24
00:03:27,990 --> 00:03:30,470
and take Zhao Yuanzhou's inner core now?

25
00:03:31,850 --> 00:03:33,180
Repay you?

26
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:35,480
Why don't we repay you with a beating?

27
00:03:37,820 --> 00:03:39,970
Who helped you when you were the most

28
00:03:39,990 --> 00:03:41,320
confused and helpless?

29
00:03:42,030 --> 00:03:43,430
Who took you in

30
00:03:43,450 --> 00:03:44,850
and taught you medicine?

31
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:47,900
Will you repay my kindness with hatred?

32
00:03:49,630 --> 00:03:50,270
Jiu,

33
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:51,530
don't trust him.

34
00:03:51,829 --> 00:03:53,290
He taught you those skills

35
00:03:53,790 --> 00:03:55,750
just to use you to harm people.

36
00:03:56,750 --> 00:03:57,550
That's right.

37
00:03:58,980 --> 00:04:00,170
I must

38
00:04:00,510 --> 00:04:03,840
take responsibility for and fix some mistakes personally.

39
00:04:04,930 --> 00:04:06,610
I won't respect you anymore.

40
00:04:08,180 --> 00:04:09,130
Previously,

41
00:04:09,270 --> 00:04:10,070
I hurt

42
00:04:10,150 --> 00:04:11,830
and lied to my friends.

43
00:04:12,190 --> 00:04:14,400
I will do my best to make up for it.

44
00:04:19,020 --> 00:04:19,980
Sister Pei.

45
00:04:20,430 --> 00:04:21,490
Give me the arrow.

46
00:04:23,269 --> 00:04:24,440
What are you doing?

47
00:04:47,550 --> 00:04:48,110
Jiu.

48
00:04:48,140 --> 00:04:48,920
Jiu.

49
00:04:49,270 --> 00:04:51,000
Don't hurt yourself like this.

50
00:04:55,790 --> 00:04:58,720
Isn't Little Bunny the most timid and afraid of pain?

51
00:05:00,230 --> 00:05:01,470
I am timid

52
00:05:03,030 --> 00:05:04,090
and afraid of pain,

53
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:08,340
but I'm more afraid of losing you all.

54
00:05:18,630 --> 00:05:19,710
From now on,

55
00:05:20,350 --> 00:05:22,480
I'm no longer a member of Chongwu Camp.

56
00:05:22,550 --> 00:05:24,310
I won't let you manipulate me

57
00:05:24,310 --> 00:05:25,190
as your puppet anymore.

58
00:05:25,190 --> 00:05:25,990
Enough!

59
00:05:28,230 --> 00:05:29,880
Since this is your decision,

60
00:05:32,210 --> 00:05:34,060
don't blame me for being cruel.

61
00:05:56,630 --> 00:05:57,580
Shoot!

62
00:06:42,060 --> 00:06:42,920
They can't be killed.

63
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:44,320
Demonized humans again?

64
00:06:44,630 --> 00:06:45,830
Zhao Yuanzhou.

65
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:47,240
Do something.

66
00:06:58,320 --> 00:06:59,740
Stop.

67
00:07:06,280 --> 00:07:07,480
Your magic

68
00:07:07,770 --> 00:07:10,830
is useless against these demonized humans and arrows.

69
00:07:12,110 --> 00:07:15,170
My Demon Slaying Arrow specializes in killing demons.

70
00:07:15,700 --> 00:07:17,640
How can you control it?

71
00:07:20,430 --> 00:07:21,490
Zhao Yuanzhou,

72
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:24,640
don't waste your energy in resisting.

73
00:07:24,640 --> 00:07:26,090
Surrender.

74
00:08:16,820 --> 00:08:17,500
Oh no.

75
00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:19,280
There's a silver needle on the arrow.

76
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:21,210
He sealed the Great Demon's touch.

77
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:23,870
Zhao Yuanzhou.

78
00:08:24,110 --> 00:08:26,150
Now, there's only one last step left

79
00:08:26,150 --> 00:08:27,550
to seal your five senses.

80
00:08:28,170 --> 00:08:29,750
I just need to use the silver needle

81
00:08:29,750 --> 00:08:31,300
to seal your sense of touch

82
00:08:31,750 --> 00:08:33,750
and everything will be set.

83
00:08:34,040 --> 00:08:35,010
Master,

84
00:08:35,510 --> 00:08:37,270
why will sealing a demon's five senses

85
00:08:37,270 --> 00:08:39,270
make them spit out their inner core?

86
00:08:39,470 --> 00:08:41,070
With the five senses sealed,

87
00:08:41,110 --> 00:08:42,309
the physical body will become

88
00:08:42,309 --> 00:08:43,830
a tight jar.

89
00:08:44,190 --> 00:08:46,120
The inner core has a conscious mind

90
00:08:46,710 --> 00:08:48,270
and will struggle

91
00:08:48,270 --> 00:08:49,600
like a drowning person.

92
00:08:52,430 --> 00:08:53,230
Besides,

93
00:08:54,310 --> 00:08:57,110
the Ever-Burning Wood is in Zhao Yuanzhou's body.

94
00:08:58,300 --> 00:09:00,160
After the five senses are sealed,

95
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:02,980
the fire will burn his entire body.

96
00:09:04,450 --> 00:09:06,060
It'll be torturous.

97
00:09:08,350 --> 00:09:09,390
Zhao Yuanzhou.

98
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:12,400
The last needle has been completed.

99
00:09:12,420 --> 00:09:14,070
Spit out your inner core.

100
00:09:19,270 --> 00:09:20,670
Zhao Yuanzhou.

101
00:09:22,310 --> 00:09:23,420
Zhao Yuanzhou!

102
00:10:39,390 --> 00:10:40,590
Zhao Yuanzhou.

103
00:10:42,470 --> 00:10:43,690
Zhao Yuanzhou!

104
00:11:03,430 --> 00:11:04,320
Sir.

105
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:06,080
What's going on?

106
00:11:08,450 --> 00:11:09,980
Should we just capture him

107
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:12,160
and take the inner core by force?

108
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:29,910
Wen Xiao killed the Prime Minister.

109
00:12:29,910 --> 00:12:31,750
Pei Sijing released Zhao Yuanzhou privately.

110
00:12:31,750 --> 00:12:33,070
Arrest them immediately

111
00:12:33,070 --> 00:12:34,730
to wait for their punishment.

112
00:12:54,510 --> 00:12:55,310
Time to eat.

113
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:06,390
So bland.

114
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,890
I'm a demoness who eats humans.

115
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:10,900
Fresh human flesh

116
00:13:11,380 --> 00:13:13,600
is much better than fish and meat.

117
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:15,140
Cut the crap.

118
00:13:15,270 --> 00:13:17,800
The Chongwu Army has seen all kinds of demons.

119
00:13:17,870 --> 00:13:18,710
Look up

120
00:13:18,710 --> 00:13:19,750
at the beast blood talismans.

121
00:13:19,750 --> 00:13:22,680
They're used to suppress you, evil and sneaky demon.

122
00:13:47,580 --> 00:13:48,610
At this time,

123
00:13:48,840 --> 00:13:51,040
you're still in the mood to joke around.

124
00:13:53,950 --> 00:13:55,910
Aren't you worried at all?

125
00:14:01,470 --> 00:14:04,100
It's my first time being a caged animal.

126
00:14:04,950 --> 00:14:06,590
How can I not worry?

127
00:14:09,870 --> 00:14:11,730
I'm talking about Zhao Yuanzhou.

128
00:14:19,970 --> 00:14:21,740
If he goes out of control again,

129
00:14:22,470 --> 00:14:24,320
the world will be over.

130
00:14:26,010 --> 00:14:27,290
Aren't you worried?

131
00:14:34,710 --> 00:14:36,950
I picked up the flagon he left behind.

132
00:14:37,400 --> 00:14:38,850
He drank a lot.

133
00:14:39,330 --> 00:14:42,190
He also has the help Mountain God Ying Zhao's power.

134
00:14:42,300 --> 00:14:45,900
He should be able to suppress the malicious energy temporarily.

135
00:14:47,820 --> 00:14:49,410
Since he chose to run away,

136
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,580
he must still be clear-headed.

137
00:14:52,780 --> 00:14:54,440
He knew he couldn't stay long.

138
00:14:57,280 --> 00:14:58,650
Where would he go?

139
00:15:01,650 --> 00:15:04,180
He'd probably escape to Peach Blossom House.

140
00:15:04,520 --> 00:15:06,690
He set a barrier there.

141
00:15:06,990 --> 00:15:09,050
Outsiders are unable to go in and out.

142
00:15:09,980 --> 00:15:11,770
He once told me

143
00:15:12,910 --> 00:15:14,490
that if one day,

144
00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:17,740
he felt like he was going to lose control,

145
00:15:17,890 --> 00:15:19,780
he would lock himself up.

146
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:23,280
So even if he went out of control,

147
00:15:24,020 --> 00:15:25,540
he wouldn't hurt anyone.

148
00:15:30,830 --> 00:15:33,220
But this is just a temporary measure.

149
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:34,560
So,

150
00:15:35,210 --> 00:15:37,360
we should find the Divine Wood as soon as possible

151
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:38,890
and repair the Baize Token.

152
00:15:41,650 --> 00:15:43,750
Zhuo will find a way.

153
00:15:46,550 --> 00:15:47,020
Yes.

154
00:16:39,020 --> 00:16:41,990
Why are you still struggling?

155
00:16:44,990 --> 00:16:48,430
This is the strongest power in the world.

156
00:16:49,770 --> 00:16:52,200
You can destroy the world

157
00:16:52,280 --> 00:16:54,040
and do anything.

158
00:16:55,300 --> 00:16:57,390
Why do you refuse?

159
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:05,260
Because I don't want to destroy the world.

160
00:17:08,950 --> 00:17:10,890
No matter what you want,

161
00:17:12,750 --> 00:17:15,160
the invincible power

162
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:17,290
can do it for you.

163
00:17:27,670 --> 00:17:30,390
I just want the people I cherish

164
00:17:32,990 --> 00:17:34,840
to be safe,

165
00:17:36,370 --> 00:17:37,690
happy,

166
00:17:38,350 --> 00:17:39,120
and content.

167
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:07,640
How long can you hold on for?

168
00:18:09,550 --> 00:18:12,050
Why don't you just

169
00:18:12,900 --> 00:18:15,790
give yourself to me obediently like before?

170
00:18:20,950 --> 00:18:24,410
Fighting against yourself is like going against the current.

171
00:18:24,980 --> 00:18:27,330
It's futile.

172
00:18:27,630 --> 00:18:29,310
Why endure the pain

173
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:35,010
of fire burning your heart?

174
00:18:40,900 --> 00:18:43,330
So you don't understand.

175
00:18:52,990 --> 00:18:54,670
What?

176
00:19:01,560 --> 00:19:04,080
♫A lone boat drifts through the world♫

177
00:19:04,100 --> 00:19:06,670
♫The heart feels bitter, then sweet♫

178
00:19:07,030 --> 00:19:12,070
♫Can't distinguish night from day♫

179
00:19:13,340 --> 00:19:15,130
♫At the edge of the dreamscape♫

180
00:19:15,300 --> 00:19:17,790
♫Someone is longing for♫

181
00:19:18,120 --> 00:19:19,030
♫Softly calling for♫

182
00:19:19,110 --> 00:19:23,270
♫A past that can't be brought back♫

183
00:19:23,680 --> 00:19:26,210
♫The world echoes with a single sigh♫

184
00:19:26,270 --> 00:19:28,870
♫Love and hate each fills half the heart♫

185
00:19:29,060 --> 00:19:34,160
♫The years are filled with grudges and grace♫

186
00:19:35,340 --> 00:19:37,390
♫The cry of summer cicadas♫

187
00:19:37,480 --> 00:19:40,040
♫The slumber of winter snow♫

188
00:19:40,280 --> 00:19:45,550
♫No idle wishes and no hopeless longing for eternity♫

189
00:19:45,800 --> 00:19:51,110
♫Who saw the young man in beautiful clothes♫

190
00:19:51,330 --> 00:19:56,650
♫One step at a time, chasing every yesterday♫

191
00:19:57,290 --> 00:19:59,850
♫The sun beams down on the world♫

192
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,520
♫Put everything behind♫

193
00:20:02,760 --> 00:20:08,040
♫You appear in my dream♫

194
00:20:16,020 --> 00:20:20,860
♫The flower in my palm♫

195
00:20:21,160 --> 00:20:26,350
♫Is everchanging♫

196
00:20:26,980 --> 00:20:31,870
♫Sand slips through fingertips♫

197
00:20:32,560 --> 00:20:37,280
♫Struggling again and again♫

198
00:20:38,300 --> 00:20:43,070
♫The sea of suffering has no end♫

199
00:20:43,980 --> 00:20:47,010
♫The spring breeze asks him♫

200
00:20:47,160 --> 00:20:54,440
♫What troubles turned his hair white♫

201
00:21:18,050 --> 00:21:20,570
♫One light, one fire, one crescent moon♫

202
00:21:20,860 --> 00:21:23,410
♫The vow of life and death♫

203
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:28,760
♫Yet tears leave without a goodbye♫

204
00:21:29,270 --> 00:21:31,840
♫No need to borrow strong wine; it's in my heart♫

205
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:34,590
♫The dark hair doesn't turn white like snow♫

206
00:21:34,690 --> 00:21:36,120
♫Some other time♫

207
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:39,870
♫Let's watch the setting sun again♫

208
00:21:40,430 --> 00:21:42,950
♫A lone boat drifts through the world♫

209
00:21:43,030 --> 00:21:45,690
♫The heart feels bitter, then sweet♫

210
00:21:46,130 --> 00:21:50,960
♫Can't distinguish night from day♫

211
00:21:51,740 --> 00:21:54,380
♫The world echoes with a single sigh♫

212
00:21:54,530 --> 00:21:56,930
♫Love and hate each fills half the heart♫

213
00:21:57,300 --> 00:21:58,310
♫Don't forget♫

214
00:21:58,650 --> 00:22:02,400
♫The unforgotten past♫

215
00:22:02,450 --> 00:22:07,610
♫Who saw the young man in beautiful clothes♫

216
00:22:08,030 --> 00:22:13,120
With staggering steps but not asking about tomorrow

217
00:22:13,670 --> 00:22:16,420
If I can live a peaceful

218
00:22:14,110 --> 00:22:16,630
♫The sun beams down on the world♫

219
00:22:16,760 --> 00:22:19,250
♫Put everything behind♫

220
00:22:17,500 --> 00:22:19,420
and carefree life,

221
00:22:19,530 --> 00:22:20,840
♫I see♫

222
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:24,090
♫You're in front of me♫

223
00:22:22,950 --> 00:22:24,380
I can bear

224
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:29,810
♫Who misses the youth gazing at the bitter sea♫

225
00:22:27,100 --> 00:22:28,620
ny pain

226
00:22:30,370 --> 00:22:35,160
♫He shouted and wanted to be heard by the world♫

227
00:22:31,190 --> 00:22:33,110
and it'd be worth enduring.

228
00:22:36,370 --> 00:22:38,890
♫The cruel debts of fate♫

229
00:22:39,100 --> 00:22:41,530
♫Are exchanged for the phrase "I'm willing"♫

230
00:22:41,890 --> 00:22:43,130
♫Wind blows in the distance♫

231
00:22:43,250 --> 00:22:47,000
♫The distant boat approaches the shore♫

232
00:23:00,170 --> 00:23:02,700
This must be where the woodcutter was killed.

233
00:23:03,500 --> 00:23:04,930
The smell of sulfur is so strong.

234
00:23:04,930 --> 00:23:06,190
It's definitely here.

235
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:09,190
Who is it?

236
00:23:14,350 --> 00:23:15,530
Mr. Zhuo?

237
00:23:15,570 --> 00:23:16,790
Why are you here?

238
00:23:18,670 --> 00:23:20,000
I had to relieve myself.

239
00:23:21,380 --> 00:23:22,290
I understand.

240
00:23:25,170 --> 00:23:26,320
Nonsense.

241
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:27,760
This smell is not right.

242
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:29,380
It smells like sulfur.

243
00:23:29,470 --> 00:23:30,750
You are Ao Yin.

244
00:23:31,110 --> 00:23:32,710
Why did you pretend to be the Goddess

245
00:23:32,710 --> 00:23:33,950
and kill the Prime Minister?

246
00:23:33,950 --> 00:23:35,740
And now, you want to pretend to be Mr. Zhuo.

247
00:23:35,740 --> 00:23:37,400
Fortunately, I'm very smart,

248
00:23:37,410 --> 00:23:38,490
quick-sighted,

249
00:23:38,680 --> 00:23:39,920
insightful,

250
00:23:39,920 --> 00:23:41,230
and handsome.

251
00:23:42,450 --> 00:23:43,250
Tell me.

252
00:23:43,900 --> 00:23:45,740
What do you want?

253
00:23:51,350 --> 00:23:52,710
Mountain God Ying Lei,

254
00:23:53,270 --> 00:23:54,310
you're amazing.

255
00:23:57,230 --> 00:23:58,570
No.

256
00:23:58,990 --> 00:24:00,680
Mr. Zhuo would only call me

257
00:24:01,230 --> 00:24:02,670
"Little Mountain God."

258
00:24:08,360 --> 00:24:09,570
Stand there.

259
00:24:14,670 --> 00:24:15,820
Mr. Zhuo.

260
00:24:17,010 --> 00:24:18,820
I was the one who hurt everyone.

261
00:24:19,480 --> 00:24:22,010
Thank you for giving me a chance to follow you.

262
00:24:26,520 --> 00:24:27,520
Are you scared?

263
00:24:36,330 --> 00:24:37,500
Scared?

264
00:24:41,300 --> 00:24:43,000
As long as I can save Wen,

265
00:24:43,740 --> 00:24:45,000
I'm not scared.

266
00:24:54,990 --> 00:24:56,320
Then follow me closely.

267
00:25:18,440 --> 00:25:19,350
Hold it.

268
00:25:29,330 --> 00:25:30,860
I'm afraid you'll get lost.

269
00:25:47,070 --> 00:25:47,750
Who is it?

270
00:25:51,220 --> 00:25:52,180
Ying Lei!

271
00:25:52,470 --> 00:25:53,190
Are you crazy?

272
00:25:53,190 --> 00:25:54,520
Why are you fighting us?

273
00:25:55,120 --> 00:25:56,300
He's not Ying Lei.

274
00:25:57,240 --> 00:25:58,720
She's Ao Yin.

275
00:26:02,330 --> 00:26:03,130
Stop!

276
00:26:03,910 --> 00:26:04,750
Mr. Zhuo!

277
00:26:08,230 --> 00:26:09,710
Brother Zhuo, slow down!

278
00:26:09,750 --> 00:26:10,830
Wait for me.

279
00:26:11,040 --> 00:26:11,520
Hey!

280
00:26:11,640 --> 00:26:12,910
Wait for me!

281
00:26:16,840 --> 00:26:18,030
Watch out, Mr. Zhuo!

282
00:26:18,060 --> 00:26:19,080
She is Ao Yin.

283
00:26:19,370 --> 00:26:20,970
You are Ao Yin.

284
00:26:21,430 --> 00:26:22,730
I have the Cloud Light Sword.

285
00:26:22,730 --> 00:26:24,060
How can I be Ao Yin?

286
00:26:24,090 --> 00:26:25,180
I'm holding my kitchen knife!

287
00:26:25,180 --> 00:26:26,230
I can’t be Ao Yin!

288
00:26:26,250 --> 00:26:28,380
You can get a kitchen knife from any stall,

289
00:26:28,380 --> 00:26:30,780
but the Cloud Light Sword cannot be forged.

290
00:26:32,630 --> 00:26:34,380
That makes sense...

291
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:36,280
What is the first constellation closest to Mount Kunlun's main door

292
00:26:36,280 --> 00:26:38,550
on the Constellation Formation Map?

293
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:41,590
I knew it, you're Ao Yin!

294
00:26:41,590 --> 00:26:42,350
Wait.

295
00:26:42,370 --> 00:26:43,280
Wait, wait, wait.

296
00:26:43,280 --> 00:26:44,270
This question is too difficult!

297
00:26:44,270 --> 00:26:46,130
I've never been studious since I was young.

298
00:26:46,130 --> 00:26:46,730
Hmm.

299
00:26:46,760 --> 00:26:47,760
That makes sense.

300
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:52,870
What's your dream?

301
00:26:53,040 --> 00:26:53,880
To be a cook!

302
00:26:53,980 --> 00:26:55,060
Who was

303
00:26:55,080 --> 00:26:57,540
the last witness of your beauty in your 200s?

304
00:26:57,920 --> 00:27:00,550
T-T-The mirror in Zhao Yuanzhou's house.

305
00:27:00,730 --> 00:27:01,610
That's right.

306
00:27:01,950 --> 00:27:03,360
He is Ying Lei.

307
00:27:03,510 --> 00:27:04,350
That's right.

308
00:27:05,190 --> 00:27:05,950
Wait, no.

309
00:27:05,970 --> 00:27:07,430
The first thing you shouted

310
00:27:07,430 --> 00:27:08,970
was for Mr. Zhuo to be careful.

311
00:27:08,970 --> 00:27:10,970
Why didn't you tell me to be careful?

312
00:27:10,990 --> 00:27:12,790
Do I look that despicable?

313
00:27:12,820 --> 00:27:13,370
Yep.

314
00:27:13,630 --> 00:27:14,730
It's confirmed.

315
00:27:14,760 --> 00:27:16,080
He is definitely Ying Lei.

316
00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:16,760
Yes.

317
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:20,630
Why don't you suspect me?

318
00:27:20,760 --> 00:27:22,120
You're Jiu.

319
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:24,290
You smell of herbs.

320
00:27:25,630 --> 00:27:26,590
Mr. Zhuo,

321
00:27:26,630 --> 00:27:27,760
you can smell it too?

322
00:27:27,780 --> 00:27:28,670
Since I was young,

323
00:27:28,670 --> 00:27:30,480
I've loved the smell of herbs

324
00:27:31,380 --> 00:27:32,720
because it made me feel

325
00:27:32,870 --> 00:27:33,850
calm

326
00:27:33,910 --> 00:27:34,770
and reassured.

327
00:27:36,470 --> 00:27:38,140
I also like the smell of herbs

328
00:27:38,390 --> 00:27:40,900
and garlic,

329
00:27:41,410 --> 00:27:42,950
onion, green pepper,

330
00:27:43,030 --> 00:27:44,110
vegetables, carrots,

331
00:27:44,110 --> 00:27:44,870
turnips,

332
00:27:44,870 --> 00:27:46,530
and...

333
00:27:46,630 --> 00:27:47,550
Coriander smells good too.

334
00:27:47,550 --> 00:27:48,450
What's wrong with him?

335
00:27:48,450 --> 00:27:50,650
Actually, potatoes are not bad either.

336
00:27:55,170 --> 00:27:56,090
Jiu!

337
00:28:40,420 --> 00:28:41,540
You said

338
00:28:41,970 --> 00:28:45,630
you suspect someone instructed the murderer to commit the crime.

339
00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:46,940
Yes.

340
00:28:48,430 --> 00:28:50,940
They framed me at this time,

341
00:28:51,390 --> 00:28:52,670
probably to stop me

342
00:28:52,690 --> 00:28:54,490
from repairing the Baize Token.

343
00:28:56,310 --> 00:28:58,080
This case is full of loopholes.

344
00:28:58,310 --> 00:29:01,070
The investigation procedure was a mess.

345
00:29:01,560 --> 00:29:03,130
Do you have any idea

346
00:29:03,540 --> 00:29:04,650
who ordered this?

347
00:29:07,350 --> 00:29:08,400
Wen Zongyu.

348
00:29:13,140 --> 00:29:14,280
But

349
00:29:14,430 --> 00:29:17,110
the Prime Minister was obviously killed by a demon.

350
00:29:17,110 --> 00:29:18,980
Wen Zongyu is a mortal.

351
00:29:19,040 --> 00:29:21,370
How could he make a demon obey him?

352
00:29:23,990 --> 00:29:24,930
You're right.

353
00:29:43,380 --> 00:29:44,370
Previously,

354
00:29:44,750 --> 00:29:46,550
in the illusion of Li Lun,

355
00:29:47,040 --> 00:29:48,110
I saw a female demon

356
00:29:48,110 --> 00:29:49,870
who looked exactly like you.

357
00:29:51,750 --> 00:29:53,950
She seemed to be a subordinate of Li Lun.

358
00:29:55,030 --> 00:29:55,910
Li Lun?

359
00:29:57,200 --> 00:29:57,840
Yes.

360
00:30:00,220 --> 00:30:02,090
But Li Lun is dead.

361
00:30:03,400 --> 00:30:05,000
He burned to ashes

362
00:30:05,350 --> 00:30:06,650
in front of you.

363
00:30:09,390 --> 00:30:10,970
But at that time,

364
00:30:12,170 --> 00:30:14,870
we couldn't find Li Lun's inner core.

365
00:30:16,090 --> 00:30:17,810
Is Li Lun really dead?

366
00:30:21,370 --> 00:30:23,500
Why don't we see his inner core?

367
00:30:24,330 --> 00:30:25,750
The Ever-Burning Wood

368
00:30:26,650 --> 00:30:28,370
is the king of fire.

369
00:30:29,340 --> 00:30:31,070
It can burn everything.

370
00:30:31,640 --> 00:30:33,360
I'm afraid even the inner core

371
00:30:33,390 --> 00:30:34,920
was unable to be preserved.

372
00:30:41,930 --> 00:30:43,370
You mean

373
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:46,060
Li Lun is not dead?

374
00:30:55,310 --> 00:30:57,190
Pei Sijing, someone wants to see you.

375
00:30:57,190 --> 00:30:57,870
Who?

376
00:30:58,110 --> 00:30:59,310
Why do you ask so much?

377
00:31:05,630 --> 00:31:06,900
Sister Pei.

378
00:31:06,930 --> 00:31:07,930
It's okay.

379
00:31:08,030 --> 00:31:09,230
You be careful.

380
00:31:29,230 --> 00:31:30,490
Ao Yin

381
00:31:33,620 --> 00:31:35,830
can transform at will?

382
00:31:36,200 --> 00:31:37,900
That's difficult to deal with.

383
00:31:37,900 --> 00:31:39,060
If she

384
00:31:39,080 --> 00:31:40,420
finds out our secrets

385
00:31:40,450 --> 00:31:41,470
and habits,

386
00:31:41,770 --> 00:31:43,900
won't it be harder to distinguish her?

387
00:31:44,040 --> 00:31:44,900
Yes.

388
00:31:45,140 --> 00:31:46,830
She's extremely fast.

389
00:31:46,860 --> 00:31:48,120
It's hard to catch her.

390
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:50,730
The forest is spacious

391
00:31:50,760 --> 00:31:52,020
and humid.

392
00:31:52,210 --> 00:31:53,390
The smell of sulfur

393
00:31:53,410 --> 00:31:55,070
has become too faint to trace.

394
00:31:56,270 --> 00:31:58,140
Based on her lifestyle,

395
00:31:58,390 --> 00:32:00,190
where would she typically hide?

396
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:03,590
Now is the time

397
00:32:04,070 --> 00:32:05,830
for me, the little Mountain God,

398
00:32:05,830 --> 00:32:07,990
to turn the tide.

399
00:32:09,690 --> 00:32:11,330
When Ao Yin ran away,

400
00:32:11,590 --> 00:32:12,890
I sprinkled

401
00:32:12,920 --> 00:32:15,160
my special spice on her.

402
00:32:15,700 --> 00:32:16,680
The smell is unique.

403
00:32:16,680 --> 00:32:17,740
It's easy to track.

404
00:32:19,660 --> 00:32:20,440
But

405
00:32:20,470 --> 00:32:22,670
Mr. Zhuo said she's extremely fast.

406
00:32:22,690 --> 00:32:24,110
Even if we track her down,

407
00:32:24,140 --> 00:32:25,740
it'll be hard to capture her.

408
00:32:25,830 --> 00:32:27,600
Then just continue to sprinkle spices.

409
00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:29,220
Don't you have another type of spice?

410
00:32:29,220 --> 00:32:29,790
Spice?

411
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:32,000
Huanling Powder?

412
00:32:32,910 --> 00:32:33,550
Yes.

413
00:32:33,710 --> 00:32:34,230
I have plenty

414
00:32:34,230 --> 00:32:35,460
of Huanling Powder.

415
00:32:35,570 --> 00:32:37,620
But to deal with Ao Yin,

416
00:32:38,010 --> 00:32:39,340
it doesn't seem enough.

417
00:32:40,450 --> 00:32:41,380
What do you need?

418
00:32:44,620 --> 00:32:45,410
That thing?

419
00:32:46,560 --> 00:32:47,540
I got it.

420
00:32:47,750 --> 00:32:50,080
We're missing Kusnezoff Monkshood Root.

421
00:32:50,380 --> 00:32:51,570
Kusnezoff Monkshood Root?

422
00:32:51,570 --> 00:32:53,030
Kusnezoff Monkshood Root

423
00:32:53,050 --> 00:32:54,250
can paralyze people.

424
00:32:54,260 --> 00:32:55,690
It also works on demons.

425
00:32:55,710 --> 00:32:57,700
It can greatly slow Ao Yin down.

426
00:33:00,790 --> 00:33:01,590
Mr. Zhuo,

427
00:33:01,830 --> 00:33:03,180
aren't I amazing?

428
00:33:04,620 --> 00:33:05,850
You're amazing.

429
00:33:05,990 --> 00:33:08,250
You're indeed the best doctor in Tiandu.

430
00:33:12,290 --> 00:33:14,100
One-Word Spell.

431
00:33:14,560 --> 00:33:16,040
Endure.

432
00:33:25,620 --> 00:33:28,350
Zhen Mei was seriously injured by Zhao Yuanzhou.

433
00:33:28,350 --> 00:33:30,410
It's unknown whether he'll survive.

434
00:33:31,490 --> 00:33:33,770
Once his position becomes vacant,

435
00:33:35,820 --> 00:33:38,920
I hope you, Ms. Pei, can replace him.

436
00:33:40,450 --> 00:33:43,250
Replace him and continue to be your shield?

437
00:33:44,410 --> 00:33:45,900
Why do you think

438
00:33:45,920 --> 00:33:47,750
everyone in the world

439
00:33:48,210 --> 00:33:50,040
is willing to die for you?

440
00:33:52,680 --> 00:33:54,740
Chaos in the Wilderness is imminent.

441
00:33:55,960 --> 00:33:57,950
Demons will swarm here

442
00:33:58,030 --> 00:34:00,000
and take over the mortal world.

443
00:34:00,710 --> 00:34:03,490
Your brother was killed by a demon.

444
00:34:03,910 --> 00:34:06,610
I can relate to this painful experience.

445
00:34:07,090 --> 00:34:09,260
Logically, both of us should

446
00:34:09,510 --> 00:34:12,020
hate demons viciously.

447
00:34:13,560 --> 00:34:15,780
You said you can relate to me

448
00:34:15,810 --> 00:34:17,570
and hate demons to the bone.

449
00:34:19,370 --> 00:34:20,480
Could it be

450
00:34:21,389 --> 00:34:23,120
that an important person to you

451
00:34:23,630 --> 00:34:25,370
was also killed by a demon?

452
00:34:28,630 --> 00:34:30,130
You don't need to ask.

453
00:34:31,870 --> 00:34:34,040
I heard about your rumors before.

454
00:34:34,420 --> 00:34:36,679
You joined Chongwu Camp ten years ago

455
00:34:37,340 --> 00:34:39,409
and were just an ordinary soldier.

456
00:34:41,150 --> 00:34:42,830
But in a short decade,

457
00:34:43,500 --> 00:34:45,130
you rose through the ranks

458
00:34:45,389 --> 00:34:47,219
and became the advisor.

459
00:34:47,550 --> 00:34:49,230
Everyone was puzzled.

460
00:34:51,540 --> 00:34:53,449
That's due to my abilities.

461
00:34:53,590 --> 00:34:55,239
I contributed too much.

462
00:34:55,750 --> 00:34:57,790
I just kept a low profile

463
00:34:57,929 --> 00:35:00,190
and didn't want to show off to the others.

464
00:35:00,710 --> 00:35:03,510
That's because you've done too many dirty things

465
00:35:03,530 --> 00:35:05,260
and you can't see the light.

466
00:35:06,030 --> 00:35:07,630
Zhen Mei is just your puppet.

467
00:35:07,630 --> 00:35:08,590
Zhen Mei

468
00:35:09,420 --> 00:35:10,770
is an orphan.

469
00:35:10,790 --> 00:35:13,240
I adopted him.

470
00:35:13,470 --> 00:35:15,480
Of course he's obedient to me.

471
00:35:17,430 --> 00:35:19,430
But you are so heartless.

472
00:35:20,830 --> 00:35:22,370
In order to save you,

473
00:35:22,500 --> 00:35:23,710
Zhen Mei was heavily injured

474
00:35:23,710 --> 00:35:25,290
and it's uncertain if he'll survive.

475
00:35:25,290 --> 00:35:26,520
And now,

476
00:35:26,630 --> 00:35:28,580
you are using his official position

477
00:35:28,580 --> 00:35:30,170
to negotiate with me.

478
00:35:31,430 --> 00:35:33,030
It seems that

479
00:35:35,320 --> 00:35:36,600
you don't agree.

480
00:35:53,430 --> 00:35:54,730
If you agree,

481
00:35:54,990 --> 00:35:56,270
you can live

482
00:35:56,270 --> 00:35:58,400
and be the commander of Chongwu Camp.

483
00:35:59,340 --> 00:36:00,720
If you refuse,

484
00:36:01,380 --> 00:36:03,150
you have to die

485
00:36:03,470 --> 00:36:05,590
and become food for demons.

486
00:36:06,060 --> 00:36:07,070
It's your choice.

487
00:36:30,070 --> 00:36:30,950
Are you okay?

488
00:36:33,670 --> 00:36:34,710
I’m fine.

489
00:36:39,900 --> 00:36:41,480
Is it the advisor?

490
00:36:42,270 --> 00:36:43,070
Yes.

491
00:36:44,030 --> 00:36:45,390
He is scheming

492
00:36:45,420 --> 00:36:46,740
and vicious.

493
00:36:46,830 --> 00:36:47,790
I'm worried that...

494
00:36:47,790 --> 00:36:49,390
You have no confidence in me?

495
00:36:52,010 --> 00:36:54,470
It's not that I don't have confidence in you.

496
00:36:54,930 --> 00:36:56,990
I just can't make up my mind.

497
00:36:57,950 --> 00:36:59,890
The food will be delivered soon.

498
00:37:00,470 --> 00:37:01,970
I wondered if I should wait for you

499
00:37:01,970 --> 00:37:03,400
to eat it or not?

500
00:37:06,190 --> 00:37:07,280
What?

501
00:37:07,950 --> 00:37:10,030
You need someone for company

502
00:37:10,440 --> 00:37:12,300
to eat a bun and a bowl of rice soup?

503
00:37:13,920 --> 00:37:15,190
Just going with the flow

504
00:37:15,190 --> 00:37:16,720
and finding joy in the pain.

505
00:37:19,190 --> 00:37:20,850
With a best friend's company,

506
00:37:21,190 --> 00:37:22,670
even bland soup is a feast.

507
00:37:24,010 --> 00:37:25,800
Being alone,

508
00:37:26,300 --> 00:37:27,560
even golden goblets

509
00:37:27,660 --> 00:37:28,950
are superficial.

510
00:37:36,740 --> 00:37:38,040
So pretentious.

511
00:37:38,070 --> 00:37:40,070
Did you learn it from Zhao Yuanzhou?

512
00:37:40,960 --> 00:37:42,170
Thank you, Sister.

513
00:38:02,430 --> 00:38:05,310
You even changed your clothes.

514
00:38:05,530 --> 00:38:06,790
What do you know?

515
00:38:13,490 --> 00:38:14,490
The smell of spices

516
00:38:14,490 --> 00:38:15,830
ends here.

517
00:38:16,350 --> 00:38:17,510
She must be inside.

518
00:38:23,790 --> 00:38:24,650
How old are you?

519
00:38:24,660 --> 00:38:25,740
Shameless!

520
00:38:37,510 --> 00:38:38,310
Ying Lei,

521
00:38:39,100 --> 00:38:40,440
are you sure?

522
00:38:41,030 --> 00:38:42,740
Do you know what this place is?

523
00:38:42,760 --> 00:38:44,820
It looks fun.

524
00:38:46,990 --> 00:38:49,710
It's a place you kids shouldn't come.

525
00:38:51,150 --> 00:38:52,490
Goodness.

526
00:38:53,530 --> 00:38:55,790
I'm 237 years and 3 months old.

527
00:38:55,790 --> 00:38:56,830
Mr. Zhuo,

528
00:38:56,830 --> 00:38:58,760
may I ask what age you are this year?

529
00:38:59,280 --> 00:39:00,200
Twenty-four.

530
00:39:01,600 --> 00:39:02,660
Nominal age.

531
00:39:05,870 --> 00:39:07,530
The smell of rouge here is heavy.

532
00:39:07,530 --> 00:39:09,660
In order to cover up her scent,

533
00:39:09,750 --> 00:39:12,280
Ao Yin might choose to hide here.

534
00:39:12,320 --> 00:39:13,950
Then why didn’t she choose

535
00:39:13,950 --> 00:39:15,890
the garbage pile of the underground sewer?

536
00:39:15,890 --> 00:39:17,940
It could've been a better cover.

537
00:39:18,820 --> 00:39:19,700
Right.

538
00:39:19,930 --> 00:39:22,000
Ao Yin is a girl after all.

539
00:39:22,990 --> 00:39:23,550
My grandpa said…

540
00:39:23,550 --> 00:39:24,150
All right.

541
00:39:24,790 --> 00:39:25,980
If you want to continue chatting,

542
00:39:25,980 --> 00:39:27,140
stay here.

543
00:39:27,670 --> 00:39:28,430
If you want to investigate,

544
00:39:28,430 --> 00:39:29,980
shut up and come in with me.

545
00:39:30,440 --> 00:39:31,490
Mr. Zhuo.

546
00:39:33,190 --> 00:39:35,120
I have one more thing to remind you.

547
00:39:35,230 --> 00:39:35,790
Ao Yin

548
00:39:36,050 --> 00:39:38,220
is not only fast and agile.

549
00:39:38,310 --> 00:39:39,000
Her voice

550
00:39:39,350 --> 00:39:41,170
can also be hypnotic.

551
00:39:41,260 --> 00:39:42,020
Remember.

552
00:39:42,040 --> 00:39:44,030
Don't be brainwashed

553
00:39:44,060 --> 00:39:45,470
by her sweet words.

554
00:39:46,600 --> 00:39:47,600
Hey!

555
00:39:49,020 --> 00:39:51,080
Don't you listen to Mr. Zhuo the most?

556
00:39:51,660 --> 00:39:52,400
He said

557
00:39:52,820 --> 00:39:55,130
this is not a place for kids.

558
00:39:55,350 --> 00:39:56,910
What if Ao Yin is really in there?

559
00:39:56,910 --> 00:39:58,780
It might be dangerous there.

560
00:39:59,180 --> 00:40:00,260
Wait here.

561
00:40:01,190 --> 00:40:01,840
Okay.

562
00:40:08,320 --> 00:40:09,580
You're this obedient?

563
00:40:22,960 --> 00:40:30,570
[Tianxiang Pavilion]

564
00:40:31,380 --> 00:40:33,060
Sir, come and play.

565
00:40:33,150 --> 00:40:36,280
Isn't this the dream man of thousands of girls of Tiandu?

566
00:40:36,290 --> 00:40:37,870
It's really Mr. Zhuo Yichen.

567
00:40:37,870 --> 00:40:39,380
What brings him here?

568
00:40:39,420 --> 00:40:40,220
I...

569
00:40:40,540 --> 00:40:41,670
Am I drunk?

570
00:40:45,870 --> 00:40:47,200
Zhuo Yichen.

571
00:40:47,440 --> 00:40:49,100
Girls, come here.

572
00:40:49,190 --> 00:40:51,830
Zhuo Yichen has come to Tianxiang Pavilion!

573
00:40:52,260 --> 00:40:53,670
Don't... Don't shout.

574
00:40:53,670 --> 00:40:54,710
I'm not here for fun.

575
00:40:54,710 --> 00:40:56,110
I'm looking for someone.

576
00:40:56,150 --> 00:40:57,140
I understand.

577
00:40:57,230 --> 00:40:58,980
Keep a low profile.

578
00:40:59,230 --> 00:41:01,950
Girls, our chance to get rich is right before our eyes!

579
00:41:01,950 --> 00:41:02,840
Come here.

580
00:41:02,840 --> 00:41:03,790
Come here!

581
00:41:03,910 --> 00:41:06,150
Mr. Zhuo is looking for someone.

582
00:41:07,550 --> 00:41:10,340
You're good at everything.

583
00:41:10,360 --> 00:41:13,170
You're as handsome as the legends say,

584
00:41:13,200 --> 00:41:15,060
with your fair skin and red lips.

585
00:41:17,230 --> 00:41:18,070
Mr. Zhuo.

586
00:41:18,090 --> 00:41:19,200
Brother!

587
00:41:20,590 --> 00:41:21,740
Jiu.

588
00:41:25,070 --> 00:41:25,910
Jiu.

589
00:41:25,930 --> 00:41:27,310
Thank goodness you're here.

590
00:41:27,310 --> 00:41:27,910
No biggie.

591
00:41:27,930 --> 00:41:28,970
Why are you here?

592
00:41:30,110 --> 00:41:30,890
If it weren't for me,

593
00:41:30,890 --> 00:41:32,440
I'm telling you…

594
00:41:34,480 --> 00:41:35,610
If it weren't for me,

595
00:41:35,620 --> 00:41:36,610
you...

596
00:41:37,830 --> 00:41:38,630
What's wrong?

597
00:41:40,810 --> 00:41:42,280
It smells like my spices.

598
00:41:44,670 --> 00:41:46,580
Is that the dancer?

599
00:41:53,940 --> 00:41:55,100
I'm not sure.

600
00:41:56,320 --> 00:41:57,760
The smell is gone.

601
00:41:59,500 --> 00:42:00,550
Keep looking.

602
00:42:20,450 --> 00:42:21,250
It's her.

603
00:42:26,270 --> 00:42:27,450
Let's split up.

604
00:42:27,480 --> 00:42:28,570
Surround her.

605
00:42:28,830 --> 00:42:29,500
Okay.

606
00:42:29,920 --> 00:42:30,220
Let's go.

607
00:42:30,220 --> 00:42:30,760
Let's go.

608
00:42:38,870 --> 00:42:40,050
Miss.

609
00:42:45,120 --> 00:42:46,290
Miss, please wait.

610
00:42:48,840 --> 00:42:49,640
Miss!

611
00:42:55,930 --> 00:42:56,730
Miss.

612
00:42:57,020 --> 00:42:58,220
I'm sorry.

613
00:43:19,760 --> 00:43:20,390
She's getting away!

614
00:43:20,390 --> 00:43:21,310
Brat,

615
00:43:21,340 --> 00:43:23,210
what did you sprinkle on me?

616
00:43:23,960 --> 00:43:25,770
Why am I running so slow?

617
00:43:25,790 --> 00:43:27,010
Stop!

618
00:43:27,390 --> 00:43:28,200
Don't move!

619
00:43:28,230 --> 00:43:28,860
Stop!

620
00:43:28,890 --> 00:43:30,080
Stop!

621
00:43:30,330 --> 00:43:31,050
Come back!

622
00:43:31,940 --> 00:43:32,930
Oh my.

623
00:43:32,950 --> 00:43:33,880
Sister Pei.

624
00:43:33,990 --> 00:43:34,650
Why is it you?

625
00:43:34,650 --> 00:43:36,000
How dare you ask me?

626
00:43:36,030 --> 00:43:38,400
We ended up like this because you were

627
00:43:38,510 --> 00:43:39,710
a spy from Chongwu Camp.

628
00:43:39,710 --> 00:43:40,270
I'm sorry.

629
00:43:40,270 --> 00:43:40,930
Sister Pei,

630
00:43:40,930 --> 00:43:41,840
I was wrong.

631
00:43:41,950 --> 00:43:43,150
Sister Pei, you're injured.

632
00:43:43,150 --> 00:43:44,370
Liar!

633
00:43:44,990 --> 00:43:46,170
Traitor!

634
00:43:48,310 --> 00:43:48,870
You...

635
00:43:48,950 --> 00:43:50,470
You are not Pei Sijing!

636
00:43:50,550 --> 00:43:51,810
You are Ao Yin!

637
00:43:51,870 --> 00:43:52,390
You...

638
00:43:52,390 --> 00:43:53,170
Stop!

639
00:43:56,550 --> 00:43:57,820
How dare a minor demon

640
00:43:57,860 --> 00:44:00,270
get in my way?

641
00:44:02,060 --> 00:44:03,510
I'll leave immediately.

642
00:44:03,630 --> 00:44:05,070
I'm going back to the Wilderness.

643
00:44:05,070 --> 00:44:06,630
I'll take him away too.

644
00:44:18,090 --> 00:44:18,730
Wen Xiao?

645
00:44:18,760 --> 00:44:19,520
Zhuo,

646
00:44:19,540 --> 00:44:20,900
it's me.

647
00:44:30,810 --> 00:44:31,530
No.

648
00:44:33,010 --> 00:44:33,610
Zhuo,

649
00:44:33,640 --> 00:44:34,630
look at me.

650
00:44:35,030 --> 00:44:35,910
Look at me.

651
00:44:36,800 --> 00:44:37,560
Shameless!

652
00:44:45,070 --> 00:44:46,380
Zhuo.

653
00:44:48,480 --> 00:44:50,690
Why are you pointing a sword at me?

654
00:44:54,960 --> 00:44:56,000
Zhuo,

655
00:44:57,110 --> 00:44:58,720
I'm Wen Xiao.

656
00:44:59,830 --> 00:45:01,130
Wen Xiao.

657
00:45:01,770 --> 00:45:03,480
Don't you love me?

658
00:45:10,160 --> 00:45:11,290
Zhuo?

659
00:45:13,750 --> 00:45:14,750
Zhuo!

660
00:45:20,610 --> 00:45:22,120
Zhuo.
