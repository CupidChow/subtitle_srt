[Episode 23]

3
00:01:52,430 --> 00:01:53,060
Hey.

4
00:01:54,690 --> 00:01:56,000
Why are you all speaking in riddles?

5
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,080
What's going on?

6
00:01:57,310 --> 00:01:58,370
It's very possible

7
00:01:58,390 --> 00:01:59,650
that Li Lun is not dead.

8
00:02:00,300 --> 00:02:00,930
What?

9
00:02:04,229 --> 00:02:05,290
When Li Lun died,

10
00:02:05,310 --> 00:02:07,060
did you see his inner core?

11
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:07,690
No.

12
00:02:07,870 --> 00:02:08,990
We thought at the time that his inner core

13
00:02:08,990 --> 00:02:11,430
had been burned to ashes by the Ever-Burning Wood.

14
00:02:11,430 --> 00:02:12,230
There!

15
00:02:12,260 --> 00:02:14,919
Li Lun has the ability to possess living beings.

16
00:02:14,949 --> 00:02:16,450
He must have placed his inner core

17
00:02:16,450 --> 00:02:17,880
inside someone at the scene

18
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:20,260
before he died.

19
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:21,780
Thus, as his soul was scattering

20
00:02:21,780 --> 00:02:23,550
when he was burned by the Ever-Burning Wood,

21
00:02:23,550 --> 00:02:25,680
he had already possessed that person.

22
00:02:28,270 --> 00:02:30,070
A life without death.

23
00:02:34,470 --> 00:02:36,940
You will kill him one day.

24
00:02:38,500 --> 00:02:40,600
Kill Zhao Yuanzhou.

25
00:02:45,420 --> 00:02:46,579
It's Zhuo.

26
00:02:48,850 --> 00:02:50,310
Li Lun must have possessed Zhuo

27
00:02:50,310 --> 00:02:51,550
at that moment.

28
00:03:45,540 --> 00:03:47,340
So now, Mr. Zhuo...

29
00:03:48,460 --> 00:03:49,670
is Li Lun.

30
00:03:50,410 --> 00:03:51,250
Let's go.

31
00:03:51,620 --> 00:03:52,230
Otherwise,

32
00:03:52,230 --> 00:03:53,690
Li Lun will kill Zhao Yuanzhou.

33
00:03:53,690 --> 00:03:54,240
Let's go.

34
00:04:40,550 --> 00:04:42,050
I brought wine.

35
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:44,250
But it seems like

36
00:04:46,840 --> 00:04:48,440
you won't be able to drink it.

37
00:04:51,190 --> 00:04:52,430
I once swore

38
00:04:52,630 --> 00:04:53,840
that I would

39
00:04:56,810 --> 00:04:59,750
personally settle the debt between us.

40
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:02,320
The journey we walked together,

41
00:05:05,060 --> 00:05:06,650
with all its past events,

42
00:05:09,510 --> 00:05:10,950
made me feel

43
00:05:11,990 --> 00:05:12,910
that maybe

44
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:14,730
oaths can be broken

45
00:05:16,310 --> 00:05:18,280
and fate can be changed.

46
00:05:21,630 --> 00:05:22,430
But...

47
00:05:25,660 --> 00:05:26,870
this day...

48
00:05:28,650 --> 00:05:30,080
has ultimately come.

49
00:05:33,820 --> 00:05:35,170
Like a book

50
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:38,980
with its ending already written,

51
00:05:44,030 --> 00:05:46,170
no matter how many times I read it,

52
00:05:52,370 --> 00:05:53,370
the ending

53
00:05:58,430 --> 00:05:59,670
is always the same.

54
00:07:30,270 --> 00:07:31,990
Great Demon, are you alright?

55
00:07:35,780 --> 00:07:37,580
Li Lun has already made his move.

56
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:39,150
Then let's go quickly.

57
00:07:39,150 --> 00:07:39,700
Wait!

58
00:07:41,050 --> 00:07:43,050
Let's repair the Baize Token first.

59
00:07:44,070 --> 00:07:45,780
Otherwise, even if we arrive in time,

60
00:07:45,780 --> 00:07:47,630
we won't be able to wake Zhao Yuanzhou.

61
00:07:47,630 --> 00:07:48,270
Yes.

62
00:07:48,700 --> 00:07:49,610
The Yao Water.

♫Heartlessness births a dream♫

71
00:10:48,710 --> 00:10:49,550
Jiu!

72
00:10:49,830 --> 00:10:50,550
Jiu!

73
00:11:07,630 --> 00:11:08,880
Let's fight together.

74
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:10,350
Take them on one-on-one,

75
00:11:10,370 --> 00:11:11,970
and we'll find its weakness.

76
00:11:23,090 --> 00:11:24,690
The one with Ying Lei is fake.

77
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:38,160
The one with the kitchen knife is the real Ying Lei.

78
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:38,930
What?

79
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:39,980
Don't mess around!

80
00:11:39,980 --> 00:11:41,170
He took my kitchen knife!

81
00:11:41,170 --> 00:11:41,950
Don't do anything reckless!

82
00:11:41,950 --> 00:11:42,520
Huh?

83
00:11:42,630 --> 00:11:43,700
Don't believe him!

84
00:11:44,670 --> 00:11:46,010
Ao Yin is full of tricks

85
00:11:46,040 --> 00:11:47,170
and can continuously change its shape,

86
00:11:47,170 --> 00:11:48,000
making it hard to distinguish.

87
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:48,590
Don't worry about me.

88
00:11:48,590 --> 00:11:49,250
I'll handle it myself!

89
00:11:49,250 --> 00:11:50,780
We'll handle it ourselves!

90
00:13:00,970 --> 00:13:01,660
Jiu?

91
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:10,510
Jiu, be careful.

92
00:13:38,430 --> 00:13:39,810
Open the door!

93
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:42,090
Open the door...

94
00:13:43,730 --> 00:13:45,040
Brother Zhuo!

95
00:13:45,370 --> 00:13:46,750
Brother Zhuo, save me!

96
00:13:46,830 --> 00:13:47,820
Brother Zhuo!

97
00:13:48,080 --> 00:13:49,200
Brother Zhuo!

98
00:13:54,470 --> 00:13:55,270
You...

99
00:13:57,430 --> 00:13:58,910
You're not Bai Jiu.

100
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:01,330
You are the one who's Li Lun.

101
00:14:02,740 --> 00:14:04,420
I'm so disappointed.

102
00:14:05,640 --> 00:14:07,010
It's only now

103
00:14:08,190 --> 00:14:09,730
that you've figured it out.

104
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:11,880
Darn it.

105
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:15,350
We were tricked by you.

106
00:14:15,370 --> 00:14:16,770
When did you do it?

107
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:19,360
I had already placed my inner core

108
00:14:20,590 --> 00:14:22,650
inside Bai Jiu's body in the illusion

109
00:14:23,070 --> 00:14:25,060
of the Demon Hunting Bureau,

110
00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:27,820
preparing to possess him at any time.

111
00:14:36,020 --> 00:14:38,830
So, I've underestimated you.

112
00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:41,350
But...

113
00:14:42,540 --> 00:14:45,590
this is indeed a great gift.

114
00:14:48,540 --> 00:14:50,020
I just possessed him,

115
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:51,700
so my power is weak,

116
00:14:52,030 --> 00:14:54,760
and I haven't fully controlled this body.

117
00:14:55,830 --> 00:14:56,870
Therefore,

118
00:14:57,840 --> 00:14:59,030
during this time,

119
00:14:59,470 --> 00:15:02,330
I can only come out and act

120
00:15:03,410 --> 00:15:05,220
when he's asleep at night.

121
00:15:10,750 --> 00:15:12,170
Even so,

122
00:15:13,590 --> 00:15:15,290
it was enough.

123
00:15:15,410 --> 00:15:17,530
Take on Wen Xiao's appearance

124
00:15:17,660 --> 00:15:19,640
and kill the Prime Minister.

125
00:15:20,180 --> 00:15:21,620
I'd like to see,

126
00:15:22,100 --> 00:15:24,630
with her being wanted throughout the city,

127
00:15:25,340 --> 00:15:27,800
if she still has time to find the Divine Wood.

128
00:15:29,350 --> 00:15:30,140
Yes.

129
00:15:31,070 --> 00:15:32,240
So,

130
00:15:33,260 --> 00:15:35,620
just now, Ao Yin deliberately knocked out Jiu

131
00:15:35,620 --> 00:15:38,020
to let you out and control the situation?

132
00:15:38,050 --> 00:15:38,860
That's right.

133
00:15:39,950 --> 00:15:40,870
Otherwise,

134
00:15:41,670 --> 00:15:43,160
how could I stop you?

135
00:15:43,620 --> 00:15:45,280
You deceived Mr. Zhuo,

136
00:15:45,430 --> 00:15:47,090
using him to kill.

137
00:15:47,310 --> 00:15:49,280
What exactly do you plan to do to Great Demon?

138
00:15:49,280 --> 00:15:50,270
Mr. Zhuo,

139
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:52,280
this is the Soul Trapping Needle

140
00:15:52,430 --> 00:15:53,500
that I've been developing

141
00:15:53,500 --> 00:15:54,400
for a long time.

142
00:15:54,470 --> 00:15:55,470
It's a medicine to fake death

143
00:15:55,470 --> 00:15:56,430
made from Death Ginseng

144
00:15:56,430 --> 00:15:58,380
and Kusnezoff Monkshood Root.

145
00:16:02,430 --> 00:16:03,410
Why did you

146
00:16:03,430 --> 00:16:05,290
suddenly start developing this?

147
00:16:08,740 --> 00:16:10,510
I just wanted to

148
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:13,400
make up for the harm I caused everyone.

149
00:16:14,700 --> 00:16:16,510
You don't need to feel guilty.

150
00:16:17,140 --> 00:16:18,450
It was not your fault,

151
00:16:19,530 --> 00:16:20,700
but Li Lun's.

152
00:16:25,110 --> 00:16:27,440
What exactly is the Soul Trapping Needle?

153
00:16:27,580 --> 00:16:30,230
I used half of my soul's power

154
00:16:31,100 --> 00:16:32,700
to condense it into a needle.

155
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:34,830
It can trap spirits

156
00:16:35,620 --> 00:16:37,010
and control souls.

157
00:16:38,590 --> 00:16:39,460
Don't worry.

158
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:42,020
This time,

159
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:45,580
Zhao Yuanzhou is entirely under my control.

160
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:51,020
As long as we succeed in driving it into the center of his forehead,

161
00:16:51,020 --> 00:16:53,350
he will be mine to command.

162
00:16:54,100 --> 00:16:56,500
He will no longer remember who he is,

163
00:16:58,670 --> 00:16:59,530
and naturally,

164
00:17:00,710 --> 00:17:02,140
he will forget all of you.

165
00:17:02,870 --> 00:17:04,320
From now on,

166
00:17:05,070 --> 00:17:07,400
he will only obediently follow my orders.

167
00:17:08,550 --> 00:17:10,550
And the malicious energy he carries

168
00:17:11,069 --> 00:17:13,010
will no longer be his curse

169
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:17,160
but rather the sharp blade with which he dominates the world.

170
00:17:51,750 --> 00:17:53,460
Are you reluctant to do it?

171
00:17:55,910 --> 00:17:56,850
That's right.

172
00:17:57,810 --> 00:17:58,670
If you strike a few more times,

173
00:17:58,670 --> 00:18:00,000
I may not die,

174
00:18:00,750 --> 00:18:01,860
but Bai Jiu...

175
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:03,630
definitely will.

176
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:46,820
I raised this piece of Divine Wood myself.

177
00:18:47,010 --> 00:18:49,470
During the 300 years trapped in the sundial,

178
00:18:49,820 --> 00:18:52,300
I played this melody every day.

179
00:18:53,250 --> 00:18:55,050
It naturally resonates with me.

180
00:18:59,810 --> 00:19:01,020
Goddess,

181
00:19:01,310 --> 00:19:02,460
go and find Zhao Yuanzhou.

182
00:19:02,460 --> 00:19:03,880
Leave this to us!

183
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:19,330
Zhao Yuanzhou!

184
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:22,650
I don't want to kill you with the Cloud Light Sword.

185
00:20:22,650 --> 00:20:23,580
So,

186
00:20:24,030 --> 00:20:25,500
I must do this.

187
00:20:39,340 --> 00:20:40,530
This time,

188
00:20:42,190 --> 00:20:43,920
I bled myself for you.

189
00:22:11,510 --> 00:22:12,510
Zhuo, stop!

190
00:22:12,510 --> 00:22:14,240
That silver needle is fake!

191
00:22:19,830 --> 00:22:20,630
Zhuo!

192
00:22:25,340 --> 00:22:26,110
Zhuo.

193
00:22:26,150 --> 00:22:27,610
Why are you here?

194
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:30,100
Bai Jiu has been controlled by Li Lun.

195
00:22:30,100 --> 00:22:31,460
Go out and help them first.

196
00:22:31,460 --> 00:22:32,790
Leave Great Demon to me.

197
00:22:33,650 --> 00:22:34,680
No.

198
00:22:35,670 --> 00:22:37,070
It's too dangerous here.

199
00:22:47,470 --> 00:22:48,460
Don't worry.

200
00:22:51,860 --> 00:22:52,960
Be careful.

201
00:23:35,840 --> 00:23:37,840
Where is Jing's Shadow Hunting Bow?

202
00:24:08,460 --> 00:24:09,810
Where is Zhao Yuanzhou?

203
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:12,580
A calamity can last for a thousand years.

204
00:24:12,770 --> 00:24:14,030
Don't worry.

205
00:24:14,170 --> 00:24:15,310
He's fine.

206
00:25:30,900 --> 00:25:33,460
♫A lone boat drifts through the world♫

207
00:25:33,480 --> 00:25:36,050
♫The heart feels bitter, then sweet♫

208
00:25:36,410 --> 00:25:41,450
♫Can't distinguish night from day♫

209
00:25:42,790 --> 00:25:44,590
♫At the edge of the dreamscape♫

210
00:25:44,810 --> 00:25:47,350
♫Someone is longing for♫

00:25:47,610 --> 00:25:48,700
♫Softly calling for♫

212
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:52,840
♫A past that can't be brought back♫

213
00:25:53,190 --> 00:25:55,800
♫The world echoes with a single sigh♫

214
00:25:55,860 --> 00:25:58,360
♫Love and hate each fills half the heart♫

215
00:25:58,630 --> 00:26:03,710
♫The years are filled with grudges and grace♫

216
00:26:04,830 --> 00:26:06,930
♫The cry of summer cicadas♫

217
00:26:06,980 --> 00:26:09,590
♫The slumber of winter snow♫

218
00:26:09,810 --> 00:26:15,120
♫No idle wishes and no hopeless longing for eternity♫

219
00:26:15,310 --> 00:26:20,780
♫Who saw the young man in beautiful clothes♫

220
00:26:20,830 --> 00:26:26,130
♫One step at a time, chasing every yesterday♫

221
00:26:26,670 --> 00:26:29,330
♫The sun beams down on the world♫

222
00:26:29,480 --> 00:26:32,070
♫Put everything behind♫

223
00:26:32,210 --> 00:26:37,510
♫You appear in my dream♫

224
00:26:45,400 --> 00:26:50,240
♫The flower in my palm♫

225
00:26:50,580 --> 00:26:55,790
♫Is everchanging♫

226
00:26:56,470 --> 00:27:01,330
♫Sand slips through fingertips♫

00:27:01,960 --> 00:27:06,710
♫Struggling again and again♫

228
00:27:07,670 --> 00:27:12,510
♫The sea of suffering has no end♫

229
00:27:13,400 --> 00:27:17,110
♫The spring breeze asks him♫

230
00:27:17,210 --> 00:27:23,820
♫What troubles turned his hair white♫

231
00:27:21,930 --> 00:27:23,640
If only...

232
00:27:26,260 --> 00:27:27,780
you were real.

233
00:27:35,380 --> 00:27:36,310
Unfortunately,

234
00:27:42,210 --> 00:27:44,380
this is just my imagination.

235
00:27:57,880 --> 00:27:59,330
In your imagination,

236
00:28:00,410 --> 00:28:02,270
would I hit you this way?

237
00:28:03,670 --> 00:28:04,350
Yes,

238
00:28:04,370 --> 00:28:06,110
but it wouldn't hurt this much.

239
00:28:09,970 --> 00:28:12,370
♫One light, one fire, one crescent moon♫

240
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:15,020
♫The vow of life and death♫

♫Yet tears leave without a goodbye♫

242
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:23,540
♫No need to borrow strong wine; it's in my heart♫

243
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:26,310
♫The dark hair doesn't turn white like snow♫

244
00:28:26,410 --> 00:28:31,630
♫Some other time, let's watch the setting sun again♫

245
00:28:29,240 --> 00:28:30,040
So...

246

♫The cruel debts of fate♫

247
00:28:34,560 --> 00:28:36,130

♫The distant boat approaches the shore♫

00:28:54,530 --> 00:28:55,820
is fixed?

254
00:28:57,480 --> 00:28:58,110
Yes.

255
00:29:02,310 --> 00:29:03,880
Why do you seem

256
00:29:05,680 --> 00:29:07,530
different from before?

257
00:29:13,510 --> 00:29:15,110
We've been apart for so long.

258
00:29:17,230 --> 00:29:19,260
Of course, things have changed.

259
00:29:23,210 --> 00:29:24,210

One day apart

295
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:44,100
felt like three years, right?

296
00:31:48,950 --> 00:31:50,610
If you say so.

297
00:31:55,930 --> 00:31:57,240
One day apart

298
00:31:59,370 --> 00:32:00,950

307
00:32:48,010 --> 00:32:48,930
Look closely.

308
00:32:50,390 --> 00:32:52,210
I'm not your Jiu.

309
00:32:52,880 --> 00:32:54,490
I'm Li Lun.

310
00:32:55,680 --> 00:32:58,740
I will make sure you die knowing exactly who killed you.

311
00:32:58,910 --> 00:33:01,230
See with your last look

312
00:33:01,290 --> 00:33:03,100
who killed you.

313
00:34:09,800 --> 00:34:11,660
I hated this bow so much back then.

314
00:34:13,560 --> 00:34:14,489
I never imagined

315
00:34:14,870 --> 00:34:15,790
that one day

316
00:34:15,880 --> 00:34:17,330
I would risk my life

317
00:34:17,469 --> 00:34:19,199
fighting a demon to reclaim it.

Don't waste your effort.

329
00:37:04,720 --> 00:37:07,940
My inner core has been inside Bai Jiu's body for many days.

330
00:37:07,970 --> 00:37:10,070
My soul has already solidified,

331
00:37:10,110 --> 00:37:12,310
making it much stronger than Bai Jiu's.

332
00:37:12,750 --> 00:37:15,250
His soul is nothing but a weak ant

333
00:37:15,430 --> 00:37:17,500
compared to mine,

334
00:37:17,530 --> 00:37:19,390
which can be easily crushed by me.

335
00:37:21,370 --> 00:37:24,690
After staying for the last few hours,

336
00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:27,330
his soul

337
00:37:27,910 --> 00:37:30,570
will never come out again.

338
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:33,810
I'm too timid.

339
00:38:34,210 --> 00:38:35,040
But

340
00:38:35,070 --> 00:38:37,800
whenever I hear the bells on your braids ringing,

341
00:38:39,060 --> 00:38:40,370
I know

342
00:38:40,510 --> 00:38:42,450
you're by my side.

343
00:38:43,750 --> 00:38:45,360
And I'll feel safe.

344
00:38:53,030 --> 00:38:54,310
Are you scared?

345
00:38:54,940 --> 00:38:56,410
With you

346
00:38:56,790 --> 00:38:58,910
and your powerful Cloud Light Sword here,

347
00:38:58,910 --> 00:39:00,390
I'm not that scared.

348
00:39:17,880 --> 00:39:19,230
I'm sure it will be fine.

349
00:40:05,820 --> 00:40:07,270
Mr. Zhuo!

350
00:40:10,360 --> 00:40:12,300
Your body can't take any more!

351
00:40:12,340 --> 00:40:14,800
Don't consume any more of your Bingyi blood!

352
00:40:34,620 --> 00:40:37,160
Give Jiu back to me!

353
00:42:14,940 --> 00:42:15,740
Zhuo!

354
00:42:19,170 --> 00:42:19,970
Li Lun!

355
00:42:30,580 --> 00:42:31,650
Mr. Zhuo.

356
00:42:36,450 --> 00:42:37,980
You're really hard to kill.

357
00:42:39,040 --> 00:42:41,300
You ultimately managed to escape death.

358
00:42:41,560 --> 00:42:43,740
How could I possibly die before you?

359
00:42:43,760 --> 00:42:45,370
Mr. Zhuo, wake up.

360
00:42:45,980 --> 00:42:48,040
I promise I won't argue with you anymore,

361
00:42:48,040 --> 00:42:48,760
okay?

362
00:42:49,130 --> 00:42:49,940
Mr. Zhuo.

363
00:42:50,230 --> 00:42:51,490
Zhao Yuanzhou,

364
00:42:52,020 --> 00:42:53,950
I'm actually very grateful to you.

365
00:42:56,070 --> 00:42:58,790
If it weren't for you bringing this kid to me,

366
00:42:59,190 --> 00:43:01,720
how could I have obtained such a perfect body,

367
00:43:01,810 --> 00:43:04,720
so well-matched to my pagoda ghost form?

368
00:43:06,760 --> 00:43:09,620
You've finally done something that makes me happy.

369
00:43:10,870 --> 00:43:13,070
You cooperated with Wen Zongyu

370
00:43:13,490 --> 00:43:15,670
just for this body, didn't you?

371
00:43:16,200 --> 00:43:17,580
You know very well

372
00:43:18,180 --> 00:43:21,040
that once you break free from Baize Goddess's seal,

373
00:43:21,270 --> 00:43:24,020
your true form will quickly wither and die.

374
00:43:25,430 --> 00:43:27,150
You do know me well.

375
00:43:28,850 --> 00:43:30,250
But if anyone's to blame,

376
00:43:31,860 --> 00:43:33,860
it's Wen Zongyu for being ruthless.

377
00:43:34,850 --> 00:43:37,370
He even sacrificed his disciple.

378
00:43:37,960 --> 00:43:39,790
I've always told you

379
00:43:39,870 --> 00:43:41,330
that humans, though weak,

380
00:43:41,370 --> 00:43:43,190
are far more vicious

381
00:43:43,490 --> 00:43:44,890
than powerful demons.

382
00:43:46,270 --> 00:43:47,630
You never believed me.

383
00:43:49,240 --> 00:43:51,840
Wen Zongyu could even sacrifice his disciple.

384
00:43:51,980 --> 00:43:53,780
You're not his family or friend.

385
00:43:53,790 --> 00:43:55,530
How could you not see this?

386
00:43:57,020 --> 00:43:58,640
Of course, I can see this.

387
00:44:00,480 --> 00:44:01,830
We are just

388
00:44:03,270 --> 00:44:05,530
using each other to get what we each want.

389
00:44:06,910 --> 00:44:07,810
Li Lun,

390
00:44:09,660 --> 00:44:11,660
do you know his true purpose?

391
00:44:14,890 --> 00:44:16,530
The people of the world,

392
00:44:17,620 --> 00:44:19,270
bustling with activity,

393
00:44:20,080 --> 00:44:21,810
are driven by greed and desire.

394
00:44:23,290 --> 00:44:25,300
Wen Zongyu covets power

395
00:44:25,640 --> 00:44:27,700
and wants to destroy the Baize Token,

396
00:44:27,850 --> 00:44:29,550
allowing the demons of the Wilderness

397
00:44:29,550 --> 00:44:31,470
to enter the mortal world and create chaos.

398
00:44:31,470 --> 00:44:32,950
By doing so, he hopes to

399
00:44:32,970 --> 00:44:36,500
recreate the glory of Chongwu Camp's dominance over the world.

400
00:44:37,390 --> 00:44:38,550
However,

401
00:44:38,790 --> 00:44:40,610
Wen Zongyu is too naive.

402
00:44:41,630 --> 00:44:43,270
The naive one is you,

403
00:44:44,100 --> 00:44:44,910
Li Lun.

404
00:44:45,510 --> 00:44:47,970
You've lived for tens of thousands of years,

405
00:44:48,750 --> 00:44:52,000
but you're not even as wise as a ten-year-old child in the mortal world.

406
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:54,220
Wen Zongyu has been hunting monsters

407
00:44:54,460 --> 00:44:56,260
and secretly researching them,

408
00:44:56,580 --> 00:44:59,780
hoping to create demonized humans stronger than demons,

409
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:03,750
to eliminate all the demons in the world

410
00:45:04,690 --> 00:45:07,420
and turn the Wilderness into a barren wasteland.

411
00:45:07,440 --> 00:45:09,730
This is his true purpose.

412
00:45:11,550 --> 00:45:12,950
What did you say?

413
00:45:13,120 --> 00:45:14,200
Eight years ago,

414
00:45:15,740 --> 00:45:18,620
in the mortal world, the little demons

415
00:45:19,950 --> 00:45:23,210
we saw being tortured in the dungeon

416
00:45:23,510 --> 00:45:26,750
were captured and imprisoned by Wen Zongyu's men.

417
00:45:27,330 --> 00:45:30,860
That was the very reason we turned against each other back then.

418
00:45:31,770 --> 00:45:33,010
But now,

419
00:45:34,480 --> 00:45:36,850
you are helping the very culprit.

420
00:45:38,790 --> 00:45:39,590
Li Lun,

421
00:45:40,370 --> 00:45:42,400
you once swore an oath with blood

422
00:45:43,520 --> 00:45:45,280
to protect the Wilderness.

423
00:45:49,270 --> 00:45:50,630
Have you forgotten?

424
00:45:52,360 --> 00:45:53,400
No, I haven't.

425
00:45:54,840 --> 00:45:56,200
You're lying to me.

426
00:45:58,080 --> 00:45:59,480
You're lying to me again.

427
00:46:00,160 --> 00:46:01,480
He's not lying.

428
00:46:03,200 --> 00:46:04,860
The one who's been lying to you

429
00:46:04,990 --> 00:46:06,710
is Wen Zongyu.

430
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:08,330
If you don't believe it,

431
00:46:09,930 --> 00:46:12,660
go to the secret chamber in Chongwu Camp to check.

432
00:46:13,110 --> 00:46:15,060
There are the answers you want.
