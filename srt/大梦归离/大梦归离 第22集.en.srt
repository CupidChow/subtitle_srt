[Episode 22]

3
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:17,890
She is the murderer.

4
00:02:24,890 --> 00:02:26,720
So Ms. Wen Xiao is not a demon.

5
00:02:41,070 --> 00:02:41,790
He's here.

6
00:02:41,829 --> 00:02:42,700
Brother Zhuo!

7
00:02:43,660 --> 00:02:44,570
Mr. Zhuo!

8
00:02:44,630 --> 00:02:45,670
Wake up!

9
00:02:45,690 --> 00:02:46,850
Where is Ao Yin?

10
00:02:47,390 --> 00:02:48,050
She ran away.

11
00:02:48,050 --> 00:02:48,740
She ran away!

12
00:02:48,740 --> 00:02:49,340
After her!

13
00:02:49,350 --> 00:02:49,750
After her!

14
00:02:49,750 --> 00:02:50,350
After her!

15
00:03:00,110 --> 00:03:01,640
Jiu, slow down.

16
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:03,030
Ying Lei, stop yelling.

17
00:03:03,050 --> 00:03:04,940
Whose stairs are so...

18
00:03:09,830 --> 00:03:10,690
Where is Ao Yin?

19
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:13,960
She escaped.

20
00:03:14,830 --> 00:03:15,310
I didn't expect that

21
00:03:15,310 --> 00:03:17,190
the Huanling Powder mixed with the Kusnezoff Monkshood Root

22
00:03:17,190 --> 00:03:18,579
still doesn't work.

23
00:03:18,700 --> 00:03:19,850
What should we do?

24
00:03:20,079 --> 00:03:21,890
Although we didn't catch Ao Yin,

25
00:03:21,950 --> 00:03:23,160
we have successfully

26
00:03:23,350 --> 00:03:23,860
forced her to transform

27
00:03:23,860 --> 00:03:25,710
in public many times.

28
00:03:25,950 --> 00:03:27,270
So many people in Tianxiang Pavilion

29
00:03:27,270 --> 00:03:28,660
saw it with their own eyes

30
00:03:28,660 --> 00:03:30,910
that Ao Yin is a demon who can transform

31
00:03:31,030 --> 00:03:32,950
into a human and bewitch people.

32
00:03:32,980 --> 00:03:33,470
Yes.

33
00:03:33,829 --> 00:03:35,160
Her biggest mistake was

34
00:03:35,190 --> 00:03:36,890
she transformed into Wen.

35
00:03:36,980 --> 00:03:38,860
Everyone there can prove it.

36
00:03:38,890 --> 00:03:40,390
The Prime Minister's death

37
00:03:40,390 --> 00:03:41,950
is clearly beyond human capability.

38
00:03:41,950 --> 00:03:43,070
The evidence should be enough

39
00:03:43,070 --> 00:03:44,710
to clear Wen of suspicion.

40
00:03:57,079 --> 00:03:57,880
Brother Zhuo?

41
00:04:13,230 --> 00:04:14,190
Wen Xiao.

42
00:04:14,910 --> 00:04:15,870
Father.

43
00:04:16,670 --> 00:04:17,649
Wen Xiao.

44
00:04:17,790 --> 00:04:18,820
Are you alright?

45
00:04:19,310 --> 00:04:21,170
Wen Zongyu finally released you.

46
00:04:21,190 --> 00:04:21,920
Father,

47
00:04:22,310 --> 00:04:23,070
I'm fine.

48
00:04:23,630 --> 00:04:24,700
We have witnesses.

49
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:26,320
They had to release me.

50
00:04:27,030 --> 00:04:28,130
But Sister Pei

51
00:04:28,390 --> 00:04:30,120
is still in Wen Zongyu's hands.

52
00:04:30,630 --> 00:04:31,960
You go take a rest first.

53
00:04:32,110 --> 00:04:33,670
I'll figure out a way to save her.

54
00:04:33,670 --> 00:04:34,620
There is a way.

55
00:04:34,830 --> 00:04:36,630
Sister Pei has figured out a way.

56
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:37,730
Zhuo,

57
00:04:37,990 --> 00:04:39,250
go to the Chongwu Camp.

58
00:05:01,530 --> 00:05:03,470
Have you brought what I want?

59
00:05:06,420 --> 00:05:07,620
If I die,

60
00:05:09,740 --> 00:05:11,960
your research on demonized humans

61
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:14,720
can no longer stay hidden.

62
00:05:17,380 --> 00:05:20,340
You should know Cheng Huang's magical instrument

63
00:05:20,550 --> 00:05:22,480
can store memories.

64
00:05:23,770 --> 00:05:25,360
Zhao Yuanzhou and I

65
00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:28,800
have already stored everything that happened in the dungeon

66
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:30,850
in the sundial

67
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:32,560
and given it to Mr. Situ.

68
00:05:35,990 --> 00:05:36,990
You go first.

69
00:05:41,540 --> 00:05:42,650
Be careful.

70
00:06:37,610 --> 00:06:38,670
What do we eat?

71
00:06:39,909 --> 00:06:40,750
Mr. Zhuo,

72
00:06:40,909 --> 00:06:42,840
do you want to go somewhere to play?

73
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:46,700
Jiu.

74
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:47,540
Jiu.

75
00:06:47,830 --> 00:06:48,630
Come here.

76
00:07:16,590 --> 00:07:18,990
Are you still worried about Zhao Yuanzhou?

77
00:07:20,150 --> 00:07:21,550
It's been a day.

78
00:07:22,590 --> 00:07:24,600
I wonder if he's okay

79
00:07:25,510 --> 00:07:26,590
or conscious.

80
00:07:34,190 --> 00:07:35,330
No news

81
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:36,710
is good news.

82
00:07:41,620 --> 00:07:43,590
What should we do next?

83
00:07:50,760 --> 00:07:52,500
We already have the Yao Water.

84
00:07:53,030 --> 00:07:54,170
Next,

85
00:07:54,500 --> 00:07:57,080
we should get a piece of the Divine Wood as soon as possible.

86
00:07:57,080 --> 00:07:59,090
But where can we find it?

87
00:07:59,670 --> 00:08:00,390
I guess

88
00:08:00,470 --> 00:08:01,510
the key to finding it

89
00:08:01,510 --> 00:08:02,730
is your mother,

90
00:08:02,830 --> 00:08:03,790
Lord Bai Yan.

91
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:04,800
My mother?

92
00:08:06,470 --> 00:08:08,260
Great Demon once said

93
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:10,700
your mother is the descendant of the Divine Tree of Jianmu.

94
00:08:10,700 --> 00:08:12,980
Her true form is also a piece of the Divine Wood.

95
00:08:12,980 --> 00:08:14,080
So I think

96
00:08:14,390 --> 00:08:17,480
since the Baize Token is made of a piece of the Divine Wood,

97
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:19,330
maybe your mother's true form

98
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:21,280
can repair the Baize Token.

99
00:08:21,670 --> 00:08:22,510
Butâ€¦

100
00:08:23,630 --> 00:08:24,430
What's wrong?

101
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:33,210
The Divine Tree of Jianmu and the White Emperor Tower

102
00:08:33,210 --> 00:08:34,270
were destroyed

103
00:08:34,270 --> 00:08:35,990
by the Nine-legged Golden Crow 500 years ago.

104
00:08:35,990 --> 00:08:36,610
After that,

105
00:08:36,610 --> 00:08:39,350
two unknown great demons appeared in the Wilderness.

106
00:08:39,350 --> 00:08:41,570
They used their demonic power and blood oaths

107
00:08:41,570 --> 00:08:44,310
to repair the Divine Tree of Jianmu and the White Emperor Tower.

108
00:08:44,310 --> 00:08:45,880
But after the Baize Token disappeared,

109
00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:48,220
the Divine Tree of Jianmu withered.

110
00:08:48,330 --> 00:08:49,930
The Divine Tree of Jianmu now

111
00:08:52,010 --> 00:08:54,070
is just something immortal but dead.

112
00:09:00,110 --> 00:09:01,590
Immortal but dead?

113
00:09:02,510 --> 00:09:03,310
Yes.

114
00:09:05,190 --> 00:09:07,720
The Divine Tree of Jianmu has been destroyed.

115
00:09:07,950 --> 00:09:09,770
Your mother's true form

116
00:09:09,980 --> 00:09:11,510
is naturally lifeless too.

117
00:09:16,670 --> 00:09:17,480
So,

118
00:09:18,150 --> 00:09:20,110
Lord Bai Yan

119
00:09:20,310 --> 00:09:22,670
needs the Baize Token's power

120
00:09:22,830 --> 00:09:25,310
to transform from her true form into Jiu's mother.

121
00:09:25,310 --> 00:09:26,790
Repairing the Baize Token

122
00:09:26,790 --> 00:09:29,990
needs Lord Bai Yan's true form, a piece of the Divine Wood.

123
00:09:31,090 --> 00:09:32,510
Isn't this a dead end?

124
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:36,940
Is the Wilderness

125
00:09:38,170 --> 00:09:39,630
destined to be destroyed?

126
00:09:44,920 --> 00:09:46,130
Is Great Demon...

127
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:51,840
really going to be...

128
00:10:23,750 --> 00:10:24,440
I have an idea!

129
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:25,240
I have an idea!

130
00:10:27,050 --> 00:10:27,720
I have an idea!

131
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:29,120
I've come up with an idea!

132
00:10:29,380 --> 00:10:30,190
I have a way!

133
00:10:30,230 --> 00:10:30,810
What is it?

134
00:10:30,810 --> 00:10:31,370
No.

135
00:10:31,590 --> 00:10:32,510
It's not that I have a way.

136
00:10:32,510 --> 00:10:33,710
It's Jiu who has a way.

137
00:10:34,390 --> 00:10:35,330
What on earth is going on?

138
00:10:35,330 --> 00:10:36,110
Leave it.

139
00:10:36,110 --> 00:10:36,710
Let's go!

140
00:10:36,730 --> 00:10:37,190
Hurry!

141
00:10:38,050 --> 00:10:39,030
This way.

142
00:10:39,060 --> 00:10:39,710
Be careful.

143
00:10:39,710 --> 00:10:40,670
The floor is wet.

144
00:10:40,770 --> 00:10:41,680
Let's go.

145
00:10:41,750 --> 00:10:42,360
Jiu!

146
00:10:43,310 --> 00:10:43,830
What?

147
00:10:43,950 --> 00:10:44,550
Me?

148
00:10:44,710 --> 00:10:45,510
That's right.

149
00:10:45,590 --> 00:10:46,470
You.

150
00:10:46,910 --> 00:10:48,630
Back in Lingxi Villa,

151
00:10:48,660 --> 00:10:49,920
we needed the cypress that can ward off the plague

152
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:51,350
as the enhancing ingredient.

153
00:10:51,350 --> 00:10:52,550
But the cypress

154
00:10:52,550 --> 00:10:53,610
withered long ago.

155
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:55,080
Jiu, your blood

156
00:10:55,110 --> 00:10:56,710
accidentally dripped on it.

157
00:10:57,290 --> 00:10:59,170
A new bud emerged

158
00:10:59,190 --> 00:11:01,310
from where your blood dripped.

159
00:11:12,310 --> 00:11:13,490
I see.

160
00:11:13,630 --> 00:11:15,730
Jiu has the blood

161
00:11:15,870 --> 00:11:17,350
of the human, god, and demon clans.

162
00:11:17,350 --> 00:11:18,830
It is the unique lineage

163
00:11:18,850 --> 00:11:20,260
that grants Jiu's blood

164
00:11:20,470 --> 00:11:21,590
the power

165
00:11:21,590 --> 00:11:23,030
to revive all things.

166
00:11:25,850 --> 00:11:26,850
What do you think?

167
00:11:26,940 --> 00:11:28,580
My idea is awesome, right?

168
00:11:54,270 --> 00:11:55,370
I, Zhuo Yichen,

169
00:11:55,400 --> 00:11:56,740
swear to Heaven

170
00:11:57,270 --> 00:11:58,450
that as long as Zhu Yan

171
00:11:58,450 --> 00:12:01,290
teaches me the true way to use the Cloud Light Sword,

172
00:12:01,290 --> 00:12:04,120
I will surely slay him with my sword.

173
00:12:05,860 --> 00:12:07,150
If I break this oath,

174
00:12:07,380 --> 00:12:09,210
may Heaven and Earth destroy me,

175
00:12:09,710 --> 00:12:11,110
and my soul be scattered.

176
00:12:25,670 --> 00:12:26,630
Here, Jiu.

177
00:13:07,550 --> 00:13:08,550
I did it.

178
00:13:09,970 --> 00:13:11,040
Great Demon can be saved!

179
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:11,840
Great!

180
00:13:14,700 --> 00:13:16,020
Jiu, you're amazing.

181
00:13:18,110 --> 00:13:18,950
What about me?

182
00:13:19,630 --> 00:13:21,200
Shouldn't you praise me?

183
00:13:23,710 --> 00:13:25,120
Mountain God Ying Lei,

184
00:13:25,150 --> 00:13:26,390
you're amazing too.

185
00:13:29,710 --> 00:13:30,510
Mountain God?

186
00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:33,460
He omitted the word "Little"?

187
00:13:49,870 --> 00:13:50,830
Wen Xiao,

188
00:13:51,070 --> 00:13:51,870
what's wrong?

189
00:13:54,870 --> 00:13:56,530
The Divine Wood is like water.

190
00:13:56,830 --> 00:13:58,690
It takes 100 years to grow leaves,

191
00:13:59,910 --> 00:14:01,350
100 years to bloom,

192
00:14:02,710 --> 00:14:04,110
and 100 years to fruit.

193
00:14:07,310 --> 00:14:08,970
Only the trunk of a Divine Tree

194
00:14:10,780 --> 00:14:13,370
over 300 years old can repair the Baize Token.

195
00:14:17,350 --> 00:14:19,310
I don't think this new bud

196
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:22,400
can...

197
00:14:23,160 --> 00:14:24,250
save him.

198
00:14:26,990 --> 00:14:28,070
300 years?

199
00:14:29,350 --> 00:14:31,310
How can we wait 300 years?

200
00:14:42,770 --> 00:14:43,770
Maybe...

201
00:14:44,950 --> 00:14:47,210
he can't even make it through three days.

202
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:26,500
Protect the Wilderness

203
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:29,140
till the end

204
00:15:30,220 --> 00:15:31,470
of your life.

205
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:52,390
You still want to

206
00:15:52,420 --> 00:15:54,190
go to Archives at this hour?

207
00:15:55,190 --> 00:15:57,140
Zhao Yuanzhou is suffering

208
00:15:57,170 --> 00:15:58,700
every second now.

209
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:02,620
I must find another way.

233
00:17:20,569 --> 00:17:22,950
â™«This karmaâ™«

234
00:17:58,110 --> 00:18:00,550
Mr. Zhuo, you delivered supper yourself.

235
00:18:02,430 --> 00:18:04,380
If the servants find out,

236
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:06,550
I guess they'll faint from fear.

237
00:18:10,820 --> 00:18:12,490
Pei Sijing told me

238
00:18:12,780 --> 00:18:14,380
you didn't even have dinner.

239
00:18:16,270 --> 00:18:18,070
I made stewed snow pears for you.

240
00:18:19,870 --> 00:18:21,070
Eat it while it's hot.

241
00:18:32,770 --> 00:18:34,240
Where are you going?

242
00:18:56,050 --> 00:18:58,250
I'm going to turn up the oil lamp for you,

243
00:18:59,750 --> 00:19:01,550
so that you can see more clearly.

244
00:19:13,700 --> 00:19:15,230
What are you worried about?

245
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:18,930
Are you worried that I'll kill him?

246
00:19:21,190 --> 00:19:22,720
It's useless to be worried.

247
00:19:28,350 --> 00:19:29,750
I know in the end,

248
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:33,500
you will.

249
00:19:38,020 --> 00:19:38,590
Yes.

250
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:46,250
If in the end,

251
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:49,480
his malicious energy is out of control,

252
00:19:49,830 --> 00:19:51,030
and he loses his mind,

253
00:19:55,940 --> 00:19:56,910
I will.

254
00:20:24,510 --> 00:20:25,550
I once was

255
00:20:27,210 --> 00:20:28,820
as determined as you.

256
00:20:32,990 --> 00:20:34,710
But now,

257
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:38,370
I've realized I can't do that.

258
00:20:43,450 --> 00:20:45,010
I still want to save him.

259
00:20:47,910 --> 00:20:49,300
I don't want him to die.

260
00:21:14,230 --> 00:21:15,390
I've already

261
00:21:15,690 --> 00:21:17,330
cleaned it.

262
00:21:19,190 --> 00:21:20,190
It's okay.

263
00:21:28,590 --> 00:21:30,050
You should wipe your face.

264
00:21:47,320 --> 00:21:48,470
The Demon Hunting Bureau

265
00:21:48,470 --> 00:21:50,890
has stopped looking for Zhao Yuanzhou.

266
00:21:51,070 --> 00:21:54,000
Looks like they already know where Zhao Yuanzhou is.

267
00:21:55,800 --> 00:21:58,310
It's time to put some pressure on them,

268
00:21:58,790 --> 00:22:01,070
so that Zhao Yuanzhou can have nowhere to hide.

269
00:22:01,070 --> 00:22:01,970
Don't worry.

270
00:22:02,260 --> 00:22:03,590
This time,

271
00:22:03,610 --> 00:22:06,140
Zhao Yuanzhou is within our grasp.

272
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:35,850
Is it painful?

273
00:22:39,540 --> 00:22:41,030
I don't mind.

274
00:22:46,040 --> 00:22:48,250
Demons want to become humans.

275
00:22:49,110 --> 00:22:51,720
Humans want to become immortals.

276
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:55,450
But immortals are unmoved

277
00:22:57,350 --> 00:22:58,600
by love.

278
00:23:23,350 --> 00:23:24,470
The Chongwu Camp has reported

279
00:23:24,470 --> 00:23:26,150
Zhao Yuanzhou's loss of control and escape

280
00:23:26,150 --> 00:23:27,410
to King Xiang.

281
00:23:27,670 --> 00:23:29,000
King Xiang was furious.

282
00:23:29,060 --> 00:23:30,200
This morning, he ordered us

283
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:32,330
to arrest Zhao Yuanzhou immediately.

284
00:23:33,500 --> 00:23:37,040
Otherwise, everyone in the Demon Hunting Bureau will be beheaded.

285
00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:38,110
Mr. Zhuo,

286
00:23:39,030 --> 00:23:40,770
we can't delay any longer.

287
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:43,560
Okay.

288
00:23:44,590 --> 00:23:45,630
Got it.

289
00:23:46,550 --> 00:23:47,370
Father.

290
00:23:49,070 --> 00:23:50,190
Zhuo.

291
00:24:13,470 --> 00:24:14,480
Zhuo!

292
00:24:15,180 --> 00:24:16,160
Zhuo!

293
00:24:32,470 --> 00:24:33,600
Zhuo!

294
00:25:16,650 --> 00:25:19,220
Stop thinking about her.

295
00:25:20,590 --> 00:25:22,950
You are not qualified.

296
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:30,150
You killed her master with your own hands.

297
00:25:32,350 --> 00:25:35,910
Do you still think you can be with her?

298
00:25:38,090 --> 00:25:42,570
You killed Zhuo Yichen's father and brother with your own hands.

299
00:25:43,990 --> 00:25:45,270
Do you still expect him

300
00:25:45,270 --> 00:25:48,350
to show you mercy?

301
00:25:49,230 --> 00:25:51,590
What are you still hoping for?

302
00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:53,470
Give up.

303
00:25:54,250 --> 00:25:56,250
Look at yourself.

304
00:25:57,110 --> 00:25:59,150
And look at me.

305
00:26:01,150 --> 00:26:02,700
Embrace me.

306
00:26:03,150 --> 00:26:04,650
Embrace me!

307
00:26:04,790 --> 00:26:05,550
Shut up!

308
00:26:58,200 --> 00:26:59,260
Mr. Zhuo.

309
00:27:01,950 --> 00:27:03,210
I'm here to see you off.

310
00:27:11,870 --> 00:27:13,800
Little Mountain God, you've been in the mortal world for a long time.

311
00:27:13,800 --> 00:27:15,670
I didn't expect you to be so familiar

312
00:27:15,670 --> 00:27:17,190
with our customs and etiquette.

313
00:27:17,190 --> 00:27:18,600
Your customs?

314
00:27:18,710 --> 00:27:19,510
Yes.

315
00:27:20,260 --> 00:27:22,260
Soldiers would drink wine

316
00:27:22,310 --> 00:27:23,840
before they go into battle.

317
00:27:24,070 --> 00:27:26,570
First, it's to inspire the heroes

318
00:27:27,110 --> 00:27:29,220
and wish for their early triumphant return.

319
00:27:29,220 --> 00:27:30,320
Second?

320
00:27:32,750 --> 00:27:34,260
Second...

321
00:27:35,650 --> 00:27:37,460
if the heroes can never return,

322
00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:41,850
This will be the last farewell drink.

323
00:27:45,500 --> 00:27:47,030
On the annual memorial day,

324
00:27:48,280 --> 00:27:49,640
you can spill wine to commemorate us.

325
00:27:49,640 --> 00:27:50,650
God forbid.

326
00:27:50,870 --> 00:27:53,200
Just pretend I never asked this question.

327
00:27:53,550 --> 00:27:54,350
Mr. Zhuo.

328
00:27:54,350 --> 00:27:55,030
Here's the pomegranate flower wine

329
00:27:55,030 --> 00:27:56,620
I brewed myself.

330
00:27:57,040 --> 00:27:58,630
I put the Mountain God's blessings in it.

331
00:27:58,630 --> 00:27:59,850
It can strengthen your body

332
00:27:59,850 --> 00:28:01,160
and replenish your spiritual energy.

333
00:28:01,160 --> 00:28:03,160
I want you and Great Demon to have it.

334
00:28:07,830 --> 00:28:09,760
So you also miss Great Demon.

335
00:28:12,600 --> 00:28:14,200
I just wonder

336
00:28:14,220 --> 00:28:15,630
how he's doing now,

337
00:28:16,990 --> 00:28:18,520
and if he's feeling unwell.

338
00:28:19,950 --> 00:28:21,820
I hope he can remain sensible.

339
00:28:22,180 --> 00:28:23,690
I hope that when we meet again,

340
00:28:23,690 --> 00:28:25,420
we can sit down and have a drink.

341
00:28:26,220 --> 00:28:29,420
Then it'll be worth it, having met each other in this life.

342
00:28:32,090 --> 00:28:33,910
Let's have a drink first.

343
00:28:37,050 --> 00:28:37,790
Let me.

344
00:28:42,310 --> 00:28:44,970
I've never had a drink with you before, Mr. Zhuo.

345
00:28:45,550 --> 00:28:46,820
I never thought

346
00:28:46,850 --> 00:28:48,710
the first time would be like this.

347
00:29:06,310 --> 00:29:07,560
It seems

348
00:29:08,830 --> 00:29:10,630
he and I never had a chance

349
00:29:10,650 --> 00:29:12,450
to have a drink properly either.

350
00:29:33,210 --> 00:29:35,050
If I don't make it back,

351
00:29:36,780 --> 00:29:38,660
please give this

352
00:29:38,690 --> 00:29:39,890
to Wen Xiao.

353
00:29:39,920 --> 00:29:41,000
No, no.

354
00:29:41,290 --> 00:29:42,340
Mr. Zhuo.

355
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:43,950
You must come back safely,

356
00:29:43,770 --> 00:29:47,620
â™«Footsteps echo, one by oneâ™«

357
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:46,000
and give this

358
00:29:46,060 --> 00:29:47,850
to the Goddess personally.

359
00:29:48,230 --> 00:29:51,080
â™«Sorrows scattered, lost to the windâ™«

360
00:29:48,250 --> 00:29:48,910
I can't do you

361
00:29:48,910 --> 00:29:49,670
this favor.

362
00:29:52,510 --> 00:29:56,330
â™«Not forgetting, nor dwelling onâ™«

363
00:29:56,710 --> 00:29:59,560
â™«The way back homeâ™«

364
00:30:00,270 --> 00:30:01,940
â™«With strong willâ™«

365
00:30:00,460 --> 00:30:01,520
Are you leaving?

366
00:30:02,300 --> 00:30:05,870
â™«I slowly carve outâ™«

367
00:30:03,820 --> 00:30:04,830
Take the wine.

368
00:30:06,320 --> 00:30:07,240
Come on.

369
00:30:06,420 --> 00:30:08,220
â™«Growthâ™«

370
00:30:08,770 --> 00:30:10,360
â™«Turning backâ™«

371
00:30:10,980 --> 00:30:14,240
â™«I find you still in that familiar placeâ™«

372
00:30:15,030 --> 00:30:16,710
â™«Waiting thereâ™«

373
00:30:29,150 --> 00:30:30,900
Don't be sad for me.

374
00:30:32,050 --> 00:30:33,640
The dead demons

375
00:30:34,180 --> 00:30:36,340
will become the sun, moon, and stars.

376
00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:39,320
I can also turn into rain.

377
00:30:41,020 --> 00:30:42,790
From now on, whenever it rains,

378
00:30:46,580 --> 00:30:48,710
it'll be me coming to keep you company.

379
00:30:56,730 --> 00:30:59,480
You kept talking about dying.

380
00:31:00,710 --> 00:31:01,860
See?

381
00:31:03,590 --> 00:31:06,650
Good wishes never come true, while bad omens always do.

382
00:31:06,850 --> 00:31:08,590
God is also unhappy about it.

383
00:31:19,980 --> 00:31:21,040
Sister Wen.

384
00:31:28,490 --> 00:31:29,750
Where is Brother Zhuo?

385
00:31:29,750 --> 00:31:31,140
I thought he was here.

386
00:31:32,380 --> 00:31:33,830
He has set off.

387
00:31:39,870 --> 00:31:41,470
Although Great Demon...

388
00:31:41,890 --> 00:31:43,190
Wow!

389
00:31:43,800 --> 00:31:44,350
Wow!

390
00:31:44,380 --> 00:31:46,230
Although he used to scare me a lot,

391
00:31:46,230 --> 00:31:48,940
after being together every day these days,

392
00:31:50,830 --> 00:31:51,750
it seems

393
00:31:53,280 --> 00:31:55,540
I've become used to having him by my side.

394
00:31:56,230 --> 00:31:58,130
So in this world,

395
00:31:58,590 --> 00:31:59,750
the scariest thing

396
00:32:00,920 --> 00:32:02,510
is to get used to something.

397
00:32:04,570 --> 00:32:06,290
If only I could put

398
00:32:06,860 --> 00:32:09,410
what happened between me and Great Demon

399
00:32:09,780 --> 00:32:12,060
into Cheng Huang's sundial.

400
00:32:13,570 --> 00:32:14,660
This way,

401
00:32:15,830 --> 00:32:17,430
when I miss him,

402
00:32:18,840 --> 00:32:20,500
I'll have memories to look at.

403
00:32:32,110 --> 00:32:32,950
The sundial.

404
00:32:38,490 --> 00:32:39,450
The sundial?

405
00:32:40,160 --> 00:32:40,830
Yes.

406
00:32:45,330 --> 00:32:46,470
In that case,

407
00:32:46,710 --> 00:32:48,970
the sundial can not only store memories,

408
00:32:49,470 --> 00:32:50,950
but also stop time.

409
00:32:51,780 --> 00:32:52,830
That's right.

410
00:32:54,340 --> 00:32:55,680
So if someone

411
00:32:55,950 --> 00:32:57,190
brings the branches of the Divine Wood

412
00:32:57,190 --> 00:32:58,710
into the Time Valley,

413
00:32:58,870 --> 00:33:01,050
waits for the Divine Wood to bloom,

414
00:33:01,150 --> 00:33:02,630
takes its branches down

415
00:33:03,030 --> 00:33:04,700
300 years later

416
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:06,710
and takes them out of the Time Valley,

417
00:33:06,710 --> 00:33:08,910
the Baize Token can be repaired, right?

418
00:33:10,920 --> 00:33:12,190
Mr. Lu Wu.

419
00:33:12,350 --> 00:33:13,790
Is this method feasible?

420
00:33:14,750 --> 00:33:15,550
Yes.

421
00:33:17,070 --> 00:33:20,170
But I must remind you, Goddess.

422
00:33:20,510 --> 00:33:21,790
When time stops,

423
00:33:21,810 --> 00:33:23,270
days will wear on like years.

424
00:33:23,270 --> 00:33:24,990
It'll be like an infinite torment.

425
00:33:24,990 --> 00:33:26,420
As for the hardship it brings,

426
00:33:26,420 --> 00:33:28,440
you must think it through.

427
00:33:39,810 --> 00:33:40,910
But

428
00:33:40,940 --> 00:33:43,400
hasn't the sundial already been destroyed?

429
00:33:47,450 --> 00:33:48,680
The one that was destroyed

430
00:33:48,680 --> 00:33:49,870
was just a paperweight

431
00:33:49,870 --> 00:33:51,760
I accidentally took from your room.

432
00:33:51,760 --> 00:33:54,060
I still have the real sundial.

433
00:34:13,489 --> 00:34:14,210
Wow.

434
00:34:16,940 --> 00:34:18,219
Impressive.

435
00:34:19,060 --> 00:34:20,610
Don't worry, Goddess.

436
00:34:21,100 --> 00:34:22,090
I will

437
00:34:22,120 --> 00:34:23,070
always be here.

438
00:34:25,210 --> 00:34:26,270
Sister Wen.

439
00:34:26,690 --> 00:34:27,400
Take care.

440
00:34:37,909 --> 00:34:39,170
I'll wait for you here.

441
00:35:47,430 --> 00:35:47,990
Hey.

442
00:35:48,280 --> 00:35:49,240
How much longer

443
00:35:49,310 --> 00:35:50,640
do you think it'll take?

444
00:35:51,500 --> 00:35:51,990
Well.

445
00:35:52,520 --> 00:35:53,540
It should be soon.

446
00:36:13,610 --> 00:36:14,030
Hey.

447
00:36:14,030 --> 00:36:14,670
She's out.

448
00:36:19,510 --> 00:36:20,580
Sister Wen.

449
00:36:21,620 --> 00:36:22,760
How are you?

450
00:36:22,810 --> 00:36:23,880
Was it tough?

451
00:36:28,330 --> 00:36:29,760
300 years.

452
00:36:30,830 --> 00:36:32,250
It was indeed tough.

453
00:36:34,480 --> 00:36:37,580
I finally understood

454
00:36:38,030 --> 00:36:40,830
what Mountain God Lu Wu meant by infinite torment.

455
00:36:45,370 --> 00:36:46,540
But fortunately,

456
00:36:46,630 --> 00:36:47,950
I got it.

457
00:36:48,390 --> 00:36:49,380
Great.

458
00:36:49,470 --> 00:36:51,330
We can repair the Baize Token now.

459
00:36:51,470 --> 00:36:52,250
Letâ€™s go.

460
00:36:52,320 --> 00:36:53,550
Let's go save Great Demon right away.

461
00:36:53,550 --> 00:36:55,490
Mr. Zhuo has been on the road for most of the day.

462
00:36:55,490 --> 00:36:57,210
Can we still make it?

463
00:36:57,240 --> 00:36:58,600
Yes.

464
00:36:59,100 --> 00:37:00,430
Actually, Zhuo and I

465
00:37:00,990 --> 00:37:02,280
have made a plan.

466
00:37:09,740 --> 00:37:11,130
What is this?

467
00:37:11,430 --> 00:37:13,460
This is the Soul Trapping Needle

468
00:37:13,990 --> 00:37:15,250
Jiu gave me last night.

469
00:37:16,590 --> 00:37:17,550
Jiu said

470
00:37:17,980 --> 00:37:19,080
this silver needle

471
00:37:19,140 --> 00:37:20,880
was soaked

472
00:37:20,980 --> 00:37:21,950
in the suspended animation decoction

473
00:37:21,950 --> 00:37:23,480
made from Death Ginseng and Kusnezoff Monkshood Root.

474
00:37:23,480 --> 00:37:24,450
It can make people

475
00:37:24,450 --> 00:37:25,760
lose all vital signs

476
00:37:25,970 --> 00:37:28,650
and make them enter a state of suspended animation.

477
00:37:28,650 --> 00:37:30,180
Soul Trapping Needle?

478
00:37:31,110 --> 00:37:32,770
As long as we put this needle in

479
00:37:32,910 --> 00:37:34,910
between Zhao Yuanzhou's eyebrows,

480
00:37:37,200 --> 00:37:39,000
he will paralyze and faint

481
00:37:39,300 --> 00:37:41,470
and enter the state of suspended animation.

482
00:37:41,470 --> 00:37:42,270
Meanwhile,

483
00:37:42,870 --> 00:37:44,190
the malicious energy in him

484
00:37:44,190 --> 00:37:45,430
can be controlled.

485
00:37:47,110 --> 00:37:48,170
This way, we can also

486
00:37:48,170 --> 00:37:49,970
give King Xiang an explanation.

487
00:37:54,180 --> 00:37:56,110
After the Baize Token is repaired,

488
00:37:56,440 --> 00:37:58,080
we can take this needle out

489
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:00,620
and awaken Zhao Yuanzhou.

490
00:38:08,210 --> 00:38:09,670
Jiu is really thoughtful.

491
00:38:11,470 --> 00:38:12,490
Zhuo.

492
00:38:15,710 --> 00:38:16,800
You too.

493
00:38:27,680 --> 00:38:29,220
That's great.

494
00:38:29,750 --> 00:38:31,940
It's lucky that you and Mr. Zhuo had a discussion.

495
00:38:31,940 --> 00:38:34,280
When I bid farewell to Mr. Zhuo,

496
00:38:34,550 --> 00:38:35,670
I was so sad.

497
00:38:37,980 --> 00:38:39,190
Sister Wen.

498
00:38:39,390 --> 00:38:40,920
What are you talking about?

499
00:38:41,380 --> 00:38:42,730
Soul Trapping Needle?

500
00:38:43,350 --> 00:38:44,490
What Soul Trapping Needle?

501
00:38:44,490 --> 00:38:46,920
I've been sleeping at home last night.

502
00:38:47,030 --> 00:38:48,690
I never went to see Mr. Zhuo,

503
00:38:48,710 --> 00:38:49,630
nor did I ever develop

504
00:38:49,630 --> 00:38:50,910
that thing you said.

505
00:38:58,560 --> 00:39:00,160
There's no smell of sulphur.

506
00:39:00,490 --> 00:39:01,990
So you are the real Jiu.

507
00:39:02,590 --> 00:39:03,450
There must be something wrong

508
00:39:03,450 --> 00:39:04,810
with Mr. Zhuo.

509
00:39:04,990 --> 00:39:07,350
How could there be something wrong with Mr. Zhuo?

510
00:39:07,350 --> 00:39:08,970
You must be out of your mind.

511
00:39:08,990 --> 00:39:10,190
Wake up.

512
00:39:10,190 --> 00:39:11,510
Wake up. Think about it.

513
00:39:11,510 --> 00:39:12,960
When we were chasing Ao Yin,

514
00:39:12,960 --> 00:39:13,950
she had already been poisoned

515
00:39:13,950 --> 00:39:15,020
by the Huanling Powder mixed with Kusnezoff Monkshood Root.

516
00:39:15,020 --> 00:39:15,990
Her speed had already been reduced.

517
00:39:15,990 --> 00:39:18,390
What did that brat spray on me?

518
00:39:18,390 --> 00:39:20,060
Why am I so slow?

519
00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:21,910
Given how agile Mr. Zhuo is,

520
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:24,110
he shouldn't have failed to catch her.

521
00:39:24,110 --> 00:39:24,970
Where is Ao Yin?

522
00:39:26,760 --> 00:39:28,160
She got away.

523
00:39:30,450 --> 00:39:32,840
It does seem a bit strange.

524
00:39:35,330 --> 00:39:37,820
Ao Yin pretended to be me and killed the Prime Minister.

525
00:39:37,820 --> 00:39:40,420
I always felt that she must have taken orders from someone.

526
00:39:40,420 --> 00:39:41,850
Our guess is

527
00:39:42,040 --> 00:39:44,100
Ao Yin answers to Li Lun.

528
00:39:45,130 --> 00:39:46,050
Could it be...

529
00:39:47,620 --> 00:39:48,280
Yes.

530
00:39:52,570 --> 00:39:54,060
You mean

531
00:39:55,320 --> 00:39:56,890
Li Lun is not dead?

532
00:39:59,120 --> 00:40:00,770
Where would he be?

533
00:40:02,830 --> 00:40:04,020
He might be

534
00:40:04,590 --> 00:40:06,680
possessing someone right now.
