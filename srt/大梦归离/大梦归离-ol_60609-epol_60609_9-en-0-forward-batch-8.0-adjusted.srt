00:01:51,229 --> 00:01:53,979
[Episode 9]

3
00:01:55,979 --> 00:01:57,150
Are you a god?

4
00:01:59,310 --> 00:02:00,240
I am a demon.

5
00:02:03,170 --> 00:02:04,390
Gods aren't the only ones

6
00:02:04,390 --> 00:02:06,140
who can grant your wish.

7
00:02:07,590 --> 00:02:08,740
Demons can do it too.

8
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:13,680
There must be a price, right?

9
00:02:15,630 --> 00:02:16,419
Of course.

10
00:02:23,750 --> 00:02:24,750
I'm willing.

11
00:02:25,490 --> 00:02:26,980
Aren't you going to ask

12
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:29,940
what the price is?

13
00:02:30,950 --> 00:02:32,350
I'm willing

14
00:02:34,300 --> 00:02:35,829
no matter what the price is.

15
00:03:09,990 --> 00:03:11,080
God,

16
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:11,880
Bodhisattva,

17
00:03:12,230 --> 00:03:13,760
I wish for my illness to disappear,

18
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:15,220
for me to become stronger.

19
00:03:21,550 --> 00:03:23,280
Let me help my sister

20
00:03:25,630 --> 00:03:28,290
so that she won't have to carry the burden alone.

21
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,050
May my sister

22
00:03:31,420 --> 00:03:33,360
be a happy, free,

23
00:03:34,910 --> 00:03:36,450
and unrestrained woman.

24
00:03:39,250 --> 00:03:40,860
May I no longer be a bystander

25
00:03:42,870 --> 00:03:44,530
and instead share the burden.

26
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:47,550
Look.

27
00:03:47,790 --> 00:03:50,140
His wish was so strong.

28
00:03:50,829 --> 00:03:53,020
He was sick,

29
00:03:54,540 --> 00:03:56,220
but he was determined.

30
00:03:56,850 --> 00:03:58,660
Everything he did

31
00:03:59,470 --> 00:04:02,110
was just to live on

32
00:04:02,590 --> 00:04:03,970
to share your burden

33
00:04:05,750 --> 00:04:07,400
and give you freedom.

34
00:04:08,700 --> 00:04:10,030
But you...

35
00:04:12,620 --> 00:04:14,180
You suspected him

36
00:04:14,910 --> 00:04:16,040
and humiliated him.

37
00:04:16,510 --> 00:04:19,520
He wanted to take the bow and arrow to share your burden.

38
00:04:19,520 --> 00:04:20,720
But in the end,

39
00:04:21,180 --> 00:04:23,720
he died under your bow.

40
00:04:25,089 --> 00:04:26,570
Do you deserve

41
00:04:28,019 --> 00:04:30,160
to be called his sister?

42
00:04:32,790 --> 00:04:34,230
Shut up!

43
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:44,640
You want to kill me?

44
00:04:46,650 --> 00:04:47,770
Just like

45
00:04:48,030 --> 00:04:49,909
how you killed your brother?

46
00:04:56,050 --> 00:04:57,470
Just let go.

47
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:05,790
But what's the use of killing me?

48
00:05:07,030 --> 00:05:08,760
You're just venting your anger

49
00:05:09,090 --> 00:05:10,810
and deceiving yourself.

50
00:05:12,470 --> 00:05:13,670
It was I

51
00:05:14,110 --> 00:05:16,350
who helped him realize his wish,

52
00:05:17,470 --> 00:05:18,510
while you

53
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:22,050
kept saying you were acting for his own good,

54
00:05:23,210 --> 00:05:25,690
yet you made him suffer so much

55
00:05:28,310 --> 00:05:29,970
that he would rather be a demon

56
00:05:30,850 --> 00:05:32,160
than be a human.

57
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:34,890
Pei Sijing,

58
00:05:37,070 --> 00:05:38,610
your arrow

59
00:05:40,280 --> 00:05:42,030
shouldn't point at me.

60
00:05:44,310 --> 00:05:46,409
It should point at yourself.

61
00:05:54,530 --> 00:05:56,650
A heartless person

62
00:05:57,350 --> 00:05:58,840
also has tears?

63
00:06:01,370 --> 00:06:03,909
Does Pei Siheng know you cried for him?

64
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:06,840
Have you ever felt guilty

65
00:06:08,570 --> 00:06:10,700
in the days and nights after his death?

66
00:06:13,350 --> 00:06:15,690
Have you ever,

67
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:17,150
for even a moment,

68
00:06:18,280 --> 00:06:20,380
truly understood him?

69
00:06:24,710 --> 00:06:26,240
Until his death,

70
00:06:27,390 --> 00:06:29,950
the last words you left for him were...

71
00:06:31,790 --> 00:06:34,110
"You've committed countless sins."

72
00:06:34,700 --> 00:06:36,010
You are unforgivable.

73
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:49,690
I was wrong.

74
00:06:50,990 --> 00:06:52,440
Actually,

75
00:06:52,909 --> 00:06:54,830
you feel guilty too.

76
00:06:55,920 --> 00:06:57,360
You want to

77
00:06:58,210 --> 00:07:00,620
personally apologize to Heng,

78
00:07:01,380 --> 00:07:02,300
right?

79
00:07:03,930 --> 00:07:04,770
Yes.

80
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:09,020
I owe him this.

81
00:07:14,270 --> 00:07:16,270
I can take you to Heng

82
00:07:17,790 --> 00:07:19,590
and let you apologize

83
00:07:20,100 --> 00:07:21,440
in person.

84
00:07:24,310 --> 00:07:25,500
Pei Sijing,

85
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:28,000
are you willing?

86
00:07:29,020 --> 00:07:30,020
Sister Pei!

87
00:07:30,310 --> 00:07:32,100
Sister Pei, don't trust him!

88
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:33,920
Sister Pei, let me in!

89
00:07:33,940 --> 00:07:35,170
Sister Pei!

90
00:07:48,950 --> 00:07:50,090
Are you willing?

91
00:07:51,780 --> 00:07:53,120
Sister Pei!

92
00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:54,540
Sister Pei!

93
00:07:55,500 --> 00:07:56,820
How?

94
00:07:57,030 --> 00:07:58,460
How do I open this?

95
00:07:58,490 --> 00:07:59,490
How do I open this?

96
00:08:01,590 --> 00:08:02,390
I...

97
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:05,340
am willing.

98
00:09:30,140 --> 00:09:36,150
♫Someday I'll return to my old hometown♫

99
00:09:36,990 --> 00:09:43,040
♫Wearing old clothes but with eyes shining bright♫

100
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:45,770
♫Holding brilliance in the right hand♫

101
00:09:45,860 --> 00:09:47,740
♫Biting down on all panic♫

102
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:49,230
♫Wiping away frost with the left hand♫

103
00:09:49,290 --> 00:09:51,120
♫I finally look up♫

104
00:09:51,170 --> 00:09:54,020
♫You're in front of me♫

105
00:09:51,470 --> 00:09:52,510
Sister Pei!

106
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:30,700
I fulfilled your wish,

107
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:33,040
but you repaid me with betrayal.

108
00:10:33,070 --> 00:10:33,950
Sister Pei.

109
00:10:33,980 --> 00:10:35,610
Don't listen to his nonsense.

110
00:10:35,610 --> 00:10:37,790
Your brother's nature is pure and kind.

111
00:10:37,790 --> 00:10:39,690
He must have been tricked by this weasel

112
00:10:39,690 --> 00:10:41,070
and that's why he became a demon.

113
00:10:41,070 --> 00:10:42,700
He is the culprit.

114
00:11:33,910 --> 00:11:34,710
Sister.

115
00:11:36,540 --> 00:11:38,310
Why didn't you come to see me?

116
00:11:39,100 --> 00:11:41,230
You turned me into this.

117
00:11:46,330 --> 00:11:47,250
Sister.

118
00:11:49,940 --> 00:11:51,100
I missed you.

119
00:11:59,830 --> 00:12:01,150
Nonsense.

120
00:12:01,170 --> 00:12:02,910
If you really hate your sister,

121
00:12:02,930 --> 00:12:05,080
you wouldn't want her forgiveness.

122
00:12:08,130 --> 00:12:09,970
I'm indeed sinful

123
00:12:10,120 --> 00:12:11,320
and unforgivable.

124
00:12:11,870 --> 00:12:13,100
But Sister,

125
00:12:13,390 --> 00:12:14,780
I know I was wrong.

126
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:17,650
♫Turns out I'm a wanderer♫

127
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:20,750
♫And you're a song of reluctant parting♫

128
00:12:20,760 --> 00:12:23,770
♫I'm a black-and-white wound♫

129
00:12:22,290 --> 00:12:23,580
But she still...

130
00:12:23,830 --> 00:12:26,380
♫You're the vibrant red color♫

131
00:12:24,680 --> 00:12:26,950
personally killed her own brother.

132
00:12:26,450 --> 00:12:29,320
♫How can I not remember♫

133
00:12:29,390 --> 00:12:31,960
♫You're always by my side♫

134
00:12:30,150 --> 00:12:31,750
She never asked him why

135
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,790
♫Like wind surrounding flowers♫

136
00:12:33,670 --> 00:12:35,600
or showed any pity.

137
00:12:33,910 --> 00:12:42,010
♫Guarding the memories, never fading away♫

138
00:12:37,660 --> 00:12:39,290
Her actions were swift

139
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:43,110
and her heart was firm.

140
00:12:45,830 --> 00:12:47,240
You said she has no heart.

141
00:12:47,790 --> 00:12:49,980
But do you think Sister Pei is happy?

142
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,950
She lives in pain and self-blame every day.

143
00:12:53,730 --> 00:12:54,880
It's fake.

144
00:12:55,470 --> 00:12:57,270
It's merely to ease

145
00:12:57,270 --> 00:12:58,080
her conscience.

146
00:12:58,080 --> 00:13:00,030
I don't know what's fake.

147
00:13:00,110 --> 00:13:02,510
I only know you both don't say what you mean.

148
00:13:02,770 --> 00:13:04,940
You always call me a child,

149
00:13:04,970 --> 00:13:07,210
but even I am more honest than you.

150
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:08,030
You adults

151
00:13:08,030 --> 00:13:09,950
say hurtful words easily,

152
00:13:09,950 --> 00:13:12,020
but you hide your love in your heart.

153
00:13:12,130 --> 00:13:13,530
Instead of being insincere,

154
00:13:13,530 --> 00:13:15,910
the truth is what you should say,

155
00:13:15,950 --> 00:13:16,750
right?

156
00:13:20,270 --> 00:13:22,620
Mother, I don't understand.

157
00:13:22,710 --> 00:13:24,310
Bai Jiu, you're still young.

158
00:13:24,550 --> 00:13:26,350
Of course you don't understand.

159
00:13:26,830 --> 00:13:28,700
But in this world,

160
00:13:28,830 --> 00:13:30,190
love and hate coexist.

161
00:13:31,230 --> 00:13:33,310
Often, just a slight difference in thought

162
00:13:33,310 --> 00:13:34,970
can produce hatred from love,

163
00:13:35,310 --> 00:13:36,710
and become an obsession.

164
00:13:37,830 --> 00:13:39,580
This obsession

165
00:13:39,820 --> 00:13:41,270
then becomes hatred.

166
00:13:42,750 --> 00:13:44,290
This hatred

167
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:46,070
contains

168
00:13:47,520 --> 00:13:49,100
deep love.

169
00:13:51,050 --> 00:13:52,080
Heng.

170
00:13:57,410 --> 00:13:58,910
Do you hate me?

171
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:06,750
I hate myself more.

172
00:14:08,860 --> 00:14:09,870
Ridiculous.

173
00:14:17,390 --> 00:14:18,790
In this world,

174
00:14:19,020 --> 00:14:21,610
it is hard to distinguish between gratitude and resentment.

175
00:14:21,610 --> 00:14:23,410
It is hard to erase love and hate.

176
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:26,390
All sincerity

177
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:28,340
will be betrayed.

178
00:14:29,190 --> 00:14:30,410
Pei Siheng.

179
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:35,010
The person who killed you is right in front of you.

180
00:14:39,400 --> 00:14:40,600
Take

181
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:43,170
your revenge.

182
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:19,510
You are indeed from a family of demon hunters.

183
00:15:19,510 --> 00:15:21,240
Your brother can't defeat you.

184
00:15:22,510 --> 00:15:23,940
Let me try.

185
00:15:38,230 --> 00:15:39,110
Zhi Mei.

186
00:15:41,030 --> 00:15:43,090
Zhi Mei is the most popular candidate

187
00:15:43,370 --> 00:15:45,900
for the top courtesan of Tianxiang Pavilion.

188
00:15:47,270 --> 00:15:49,880
You're well-informed, Mr. Zhuo.

189
00:15:50,290 --> 00:15:51,820
I just didn't expect it.

190
00:15:51,960 --> 00:15:54,280
You're so strict and orderly usually,

191
00:15:54,300 --> 00:15:56,900
but you actually have such refined interests.

192
00:15:59,550 --> 00:16:00,890
My refined interest

193
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:04,060
is killing demons that yap.

194
00:16:08,900 --> 00:16:11,410
The annual courtesan selection of Tianxiang Pavilion

195
00:16:11,410 --> 00:16:12,540
has caused a stir in Tiandu.

196
00:16:12,540 --> 00:16:13,780
It's hard not to know.

197
00:16:20,150 --> 00:16:22,410
Zhi Mei was unpopular before.

198
00:16:22,970 --> 00:16:24,170
Now,

199
00:16:24,430 --> 00:16:26,890
she's overwhelming the other competitors.

200
00:16:27,790 --> 00:16:30,750
It means Cheng Huang has indeed fulfilled her wish.

201
00:16:31,280 --> 00:16:34,010
Cheng Huang controlled Zhi Mei's puppet to kill,

202
00:16:34,500 --> 00:16:36,290
setting up Cheng Huang's formation,

203
00:16:36,290 --> 00:16:37,940
and absorbing the power of life.

204
00:16:37,940 --> 00:16:40,360
Zhi Mei and the puppet are one.

205
00:16:40,850 --> 00:16:43,510
The puppet absorbed the vitality of the living.

206
00:16:43,930 --> 00:16:44,880
Zhi Mei

207
00:16:45,300 --> 00:16:47,830
naturally regained her youthful beauty too.

208
00:16:49,070 --> 00:16:51,360
If the murderer was Zhi Mei's puppet,

209
00:16:51,990 --> 00:16:55,000
why was it Pei Siheng at the crime scene?

210
00:16:55,630 --> 00:16:56,930
Or

211
00:16:58,010 --> 00:16:59,840
was the Pei Siheng here

212
00:17:00,270 --> 00:17:01,630
also a puppet?

213
00:17:07,630 --> 00:17:09,580
I saw plum blossom petals

214
00:17:09,790 --> 00:17:11,350
at the crime scene.

215
00:17:12,750 --> 00:17:14,480
Look at the plum blossom petals

216
00:17:14,560 --> 00:17:16,069
all over the stage.

217
00:17:17,569 --> 00:17:19,970
It means the killer was indeed

218
00:17:20,790 --> 00:17:22,790
Zhi Mei's puppet.

219
00:17:24,579 --> 00:17:26,069
Maybe Pei Siheng

220
00:17:27,390 --> 00:17:30,369
was only sent by Cheng Huang to save Zhi Mei's puppet.

221
00:18:03,900 --> 00:18:05,890
There are no plum trees in the yard.

222
00:18:07,910 --> 00:18:09,770
Where did these petals come from?

223
00:18:10,230 --> 00:18:11,830
The plates are still warm.

224
00:18:12,730 --> 00:18:13,940
That means

225
00:18:15,500 --> 00:18:17,290
the murderer is still here.

226
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:46,940
Before, we didn't understand

227
00:18:47,470 --> 00:18:50,140
why Pei Siheng became a demon

228
00:18:50,620 --> 00:18:52,450
and why he came back to life.

229
00:18:52,760 --> 00:18:54,460
Now we understand.

230
00:18:54,680 --> 00:18:55,900
Pei Siheng

231
00:18:56,050 --> 00:18:58,460
must have made a wish to Cheng Huang too.

232
00:19:11,930 --> 00:19:13,360
You're indeed made of wood.

233
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:14,600
Sister is in danger.

234
00:19:14,910 --> 00:19:16,260
Go save her!

235
00:19:30,150 --> 00:19:31,270
Sister Pei!

236
00:20:37,160 --> 00:20:38,500
Zhu Yan.

237
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:41,230
Surprised?

238
00:20:42,100 --> 00:20:43,890
Old geezer.

239
00:20:44,390 --> 00:20:45,860
I'm quite surprised.

240
00:20:46,680 --> 00:20:47,940
I didn't expect

241
00:20:48,180 --> 00:20:50,440
you're still as impolite as before.

242
00:20:51,630 --> 00:20:53,260
I didn't expect

243
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:55,650
you would have hooked up with Li Lun.

244
00:20:56,590 --> 00:20:58,790
I don't know what you're talking about.

245
00:20:58,910 --> 00:21:00,250
Is that sundial

246
00:21:00,790 --> 00:21:03,180
Li Lun's precious treasure?

247
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:06,000
Yes.

248
00:21:07,460 --> 00:21:08,660
So what?

249
00:21:09,290 --> 00:21:11,290
Based on my understanding of Li Lun,

250
00:21:11,750 --> 00:21:14,070
he won't give it to you for no reason.

251
00:21:14,650 --> 00:21:15,720
Tell me.

252
00:21:16,600 --> 00:21:19,120
What shameful deal did you two make?

253
00:21:39,150 --> 00:21:41,800
Isn't the malicious energy on Zhao Yuanzhou

254
00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:43,350
enough?

255
00:21:46,270 --> 00:21:47,440
No.

256
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:06,010
How do you know so much?

257
00:22:15,710 --> 00:22:16,960
Here.

258
00:22:18,160 --> 00:22:20,190
I keep my word.

259
00:22:43,870 --> 00:22:45,780
Since you know him so well,

260
00:22:46,830 --> 00:22:48,290
why don't you take a guess?

261
00:22:51,330 --> 00:22:53,350
To make you open the Kunlun Gate,

262
00:22:54,620 --> 00:22:55,660
right?

263
00:22:57,120 --> 00:22:58,600
Good guess.

264
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:00,860
Only demons like me

265
00:23:00,890 --> 00:23:03,350
who have lived for tens of thousands of years

266
00:23:03,870 --> 00:23:05,290
can do it.

267
00:23:22,770 --> 00:23:23,520
Who is it?

268
00:23:30,710 --> 00:23:32,940
A friend from the Demon Hunting Bureau?

269
00:23:49,870 --> 00:23:52,390
I'll lend you the Truth Eye

270
00:23:54,630 --> 00:23:56,680
and let you remember

271
00:23:57,370 --> 00:23:59,330
what I look like.

272
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:05,270
Who are you?

273
00:24:06,710 --> 00:24:08,980
Are you Ying Zhao's grandson?

274
00:24:09,610 --> 00:24:10,730
You know me?

275
00:24:11,390 --> 00:24:12,730
Of course.

276
00:24:14,030 --> 00:24:16,260
I was taken care of by Ying Zhao before,

277
00:24:16,990 --> 00:24:18,850
so I don't want to hurt you.

278
00:24:19,800 --> 00:24:21,310
Get out of my way.

279
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:23,690
Since I was asked to guard here,

280
00:24:24,380 --> 00:24:25,390
I won't let anyone

281
00:24:25,410 --> 00:24:26,650
inside.

282
00:24:32,420 --> 00:24:33,960
With just you?

283
00:25:24,540 --> 00:25:25,650
Cheng Huang.

284
00:25:26,500 --> 00:25:29,420
You're an old demon who's lived for tens of thousands of years.

285
00:25:29,420 --> 00:25:30,920
Instead of retiring,

286
00:25:30,940 --> 00:25:33,350
you came to the mortal world without permission

287
00:25:33,350 --> 00:25:34,750
and killed the innocent.

288
00:25:35,350 --> 00:25:36,680
Do you admit your crime?

289
00:25:38,600 --> 00:25:40,530
You have the power of the universe.

290
00:25:40,890 --> 00:25:42,490
yet you killed the innocent.

291
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:44,810
Do you admit your crime?

292
00:25:59,210 --> 00:26:00,490
You are…

293
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:04,060
Baize Goddess?

294
00:26:06,920 --> 00:26:07,720
Yes.

295
00:26:08,990 --> 00:26:11,050
I'm here to capture you today.

296
00:26:11,310 --> 00:26:14,110
Return to the Demon Hunting Bureau to be punished.

297
00:26:17,210 --> 00:26:18,430
Evil?

298
00:26:19,590 --> 00:26:22,190
I'm helping them realize their wishes.

299
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:25,600
You look for those who are desperate

300
00:26:26,160 --> 00:26:27,910
and bewitch them,

301
00:26:28,120 --> 00:26:29,470
turning them into puppets.

302
00:26:29,470 --> 00:26:31,670
Then you manipulate the puppets to kill

303
00:26:31,790 --> 00:26:33,070
and absorb other people's lives

304
00:26:33,070 --> 00:26:34,320
to fulfill their wishes.

305
00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:36,250
If this isn't evil, then what is it?

306
00:26:37,490 --> 00:26:39,610
I can grant your wish.

307
00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:41,040
Are you willing?

308
00:26:40,750 --> 00:26:45,380
[Tavern]

309
00:28:51,300 --> 00:28:52,270
That's right.

310
00:28:54,560 --> 00:28:56,590
Actually, the one who was killing

311
00:28:57,500 --> 00:28:59,120
was not your brother,

312
00:29:00,120 --> 00:29:02,710
but the puppet I made.

313
00:29:15,280 --> 00:29:17,970
Kill this puppet and take revenge!

314
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:20,810
You've always been cold-hearted.

315
00:29:21,030 --> 00:29:23,330
Let me see

316
00:29:23,680 --> 00:29:25,550
if you can

317
00:29:26,220 --> 00:29:27,850
do it now too.

318
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:49,530
Sister Pei.

319
00:29:54,520 --> 00:29:56,230
I'm going to kill you

320
00:29:57,940 --> 00:29:59,650
to avenge my brother!

321
00:30:14,790 --> 00:30:17,250
Heng is my masterpiece.

322
00:30:17,710 --> 00:30:19,450
I was very satisfied,

323
00:30:20,230 --> 00:30:22,310
so I took him as my disciple.

324
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:24,480
Unfortunately,

325
00:30:25,060 --> 00:30:27,370
Heng doesn't listen to me anymore.

326
00:30:28,900 --> 00:30:30,450
It's useless to keep him.

327
00:30:33,040 --> 00:30:35,040
But now it seems

328
00:30:36,310 --> 00:30:38,500
you still can't bear to kill him.

329
00:30:40,110 --> 00:30:41,160
How about

330
00:30:42,400 --> 00:30:43,550
I help you?

331
00:30:48,220 --> 00:30:49,300
Brother!

332
00:31:22,140 --> 00:31:25,140
Even the Original Goddess couldn't do anything to me.

333
00:31:25,350 --> 00:31:26,430
You,

334
00:31:27,010 --> 00:31:29,780
with only half of the Baize Token,

335
00:31:30,630 --> 00:31:32,760
think you can order me to stop?

336
00:31:34,500 --> 00:31:35,890
I'm old now.

337
00:31:36,490 --> 00:31:39,060
I feel tired when I move.

338
00:31:40,710 --> 00:31:41,900
I'm not in the mood

339
00:31:41,930 --> 00:31:44,560
to play with you kids anymore.

340
00:31:45,880 --> 00:31:48,550
Since you like staying in the sundial so much,

341
00:31:49,480 --> 00:31:51,250
you can stay

342
00:31:51,530 --> 00:31:53,520
until the end of the world.

343
00:32:08,470 --> 00:32:09,510
Heng.

344
00:32:17,280 --> 00:32:18,410
Before,

345
00:32:19,750 --> 00:32:21,350
I wondered countless times

346
00:32:23,910 --> 00:32:25,230
if you would cry

347
00:32:26,570 --> 00:32:28,600
for me when I died.

348
00:32:31,750 --> 00:32:33,130
Why wouldn't I?

349
00:32:35,940 --> 00:32:37,370
Of course I would.

350
00:32:43,280 --> 00:32:45,390
Because you are my brother.

351
00:32:46,120 --> 00:32:47,800
You've always been

352
00:32:49,590 --> 00:32:51,520
cold and distant since childhood.

353
00:32:52,950 --> 00:32:55,630
I never understood your emotions.

354
00:32:57,430 --> 00:32:58,590
When I was young,

355
00:33:00,150 --> 00:33:01,790
I got angry and said

356
00:33:04,200 --> 00:33:05,830
that even if I died,

357
00:33:08,150 --> 00:33:10,510
you wouldn't shed a single tear for me.

358
00:33:15,150 --> 00:33:16,270
But now,

359
00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:20,690
I realized

360
00:33:25,330 --> 00:33:27,320
I don't want you to cry at all.

361
00:33:32,790 --> 00:33:33,590
Sister.

362
00:33:36,040 --> 00:33:37,570
Don't cry.

363
00:33:39,950 --> 00:33:41,910
I don't deserve you to cry for me.

364
00:33:46,020 --> 00:33:47,010
Heng.

365
00:33:51,240 --> 00:33:53,330
I'm sorry.

366
00:33:54,590 --> 00:33:55,710
If...

367
00:33:58,200 --> 00:34:00,670
If I could let you finish back then...

368
00:34:00,690 --> 00:34:01,930
Back then,

369
00:34:02,040 --> 00:34:03,640
I only...

370
00:34:11,970 --> 00:34:13,230
Don't blame yourself.

371
00:34:14,720 --> 00:34:16,880
I didn't kill them,

372
00:34:17,750 --> 00:34:20,030
but I caused the disaster.

373
00:34:23,870 --> 00:34:24,790
It was me.

374
00:34:26,170 --> 00:34:29,030
I killed so many innocent people.

375
00:34:32,630 --> 00:34:34,909
You didn't do anything wrong.

376
00:34:40,960 --> 00:34:42,840
I just want you

377
00:34:46,790 --> 00:34:48,520
to forgive me.

378
00:34:50,900 --> 00:34:52,440
Don't blame me.

379
00:35:06,250 --> 00:35:07,050
Sister.

380
00:35:07,910 --> 00:35:09,150
After I die,

381
00:35:10,430 --> 00:35:12,630
♫I guard the eaves♫

382
00:35:10,550 --> 00:35:13,040
I won't be able to do anything for you anymore.

383
00:35:13,040 --> 00:35:15,090
♫And watch the times fade♫

384
00:35:16,010 --> 00:35:21,310
♫You hold the flame and watch the night♫

385
00:35:20,060 --> 00:35:21,100
Heng.

386
00:35:21,600 --> 00:35:24,130
♫I count the winters♫

387
00:35:23,190 --> 00:35:25,550
What else can I do for you?

388
00:35:24,390 --> 00:35:26,760
♫And waited for one more year♫

389
00:35:27,080 --> 00:35:32,070

Please.

391

Live.

392
00:35:32,110 --> 00:35:33,140
On.

393
00:35:32,720 --> 00:35:36,460
♫The stars dazzle and the crescent moon curves♫

394
00:35:33,830 --> 00:35:34,870

♫The guilty greed♫

♫Thousands of dark hairs, long and short♫

♫The cruel entanglement♫

399
00:35:42,430 --> 00:35:44,430
Don't leave me.

♫Lend me the cold lamp for one night♫

401

402
00:35:51,750 --> 00:35:52,670
Heng.

♫Turns out I'm a wanderer♫

404
00:35:57,300 --> 00:36:00,100

405
00:36:00,150 --> 00:36:03,250

♫How much the plot has twisted?♫

409

♫How can I not remember♫

417
00:36:34,120 --> 00:36:36,740
♫You're always by my side♫

418
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:38,630
♫Like wind surrounding flowers♫

419
00:36:38,680 --> 00:36:46,310
♫Guarding the memories, never fading away♫

420
00:37:13,090 --> 00:37:14,990
Cheng Huang said we're going to stay here

421
00:37:14,990 --> 00:37:16,400
until the end of the world.

422
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:17,260
Zhao Yuanzhou,

423
00:37:17,270 --> 00:37:18,270
what should we do?

424
00:37:18,780 --> 00:37:20,910
He's the one who controls the sundial.

425
00:37:21,200 --> 00:37:22,880
If he won't show up,

426
00:37:22,990 --> 00:37:24,450
it's indeed troublesome.

427
00:37:45,350 --> 00:37:46,890
Appear.

428
00:37:56,490 --> 00:37:57,930
I hope I can

429
00:37:57,960 --> 00:37:59,430
pass the imperial examination

430
00:37:59,430 --> 00:38:02,160
and become an official who pleads for the people.

431
00:38:03,880 --> 00:38:05,240
I hope I can find my true love

432
00:38:05,240 --> 00:38:06,810
and be together forever.

433
00:38:10,220 --> 00:38:11,810
If I can give birth to my child,

434
00:38:11,810 --> 00:38:13,590
I will repay you for my wish.

435
00:38:31,070 --> 00:38:33,540
It's a normal puppet without memories.

436
00:38:34,660 --> 00:38:35,870
This puppet...

437
00:38:37,140 --> 00:38:37,940
What?

438
00:38:42,980 --> 00:38:44,260
I've seen her

439
00:38:44,290 --> 00:38:47,220
in the album of past goddesses that my master gave me.

440
00:38:48,070 --> 00:38:49,730
She was the Original Goddess.

441
00:38:51,360 --> 00:38:52,850
The Original Goddess?

442
00:38:56,170 --> 00:38:57,200
You didn't know?

443
00:38:57,470 --> 00:38:58,480
Just now,

444
00:38:58,500 --> 00:38:59,980
Cheng Huang mentioned it.

445
00:39:00,830 --> 00:39:02,000
I'm so young.

446
00:39:02,020 --> 00:39:03,340
How would I know?

447
00:39:05,230 --> 00:39:07,030
I didn't exist

448
00:39:07,030 --> 00:39:09,090
when the Original Goddess appeared.

449
00:39:09,110 --> 00:39:11,140
Only an old monster like Cheng Huang

450
00:39:11,190 --> 00:39:13,250
would have met the Original Goddess.

451
00:39:15,070 --> 00:39:18,600
Then why does Cheng Huang have a puppet of the Original Goddess?

452
00:39:18,670 --> 00:39:19,670
Could it be

453
00:39:19,910 --> 00:39:22,110
she also had a wish that she couldn't tell

454
00:39:22,110 --> 00:39:23,840
and was cheated by Cheng Huang?

455
00:39:25,790 --> 00:39:27,350
The goddess's wish

456
00:39:27,840 --> 00:39:29,400
was peace between the two realms,

457
00:39:29,400 --> 00:39:31,070
for kindness and evil to have consequences,

458
00:39:31,070 --> 00:39:33,500
and for bad demons like Cheng Huang to be punished.

459
00:39:33,500 --> 00:39:35,230
How could she be cheated by him?

460
00:39:37,760 --> 00:39:38,810
But

461
00:39:39,780 --> 00:39:41,230
it's evident

462
00:39:41,660 --> 00:39:43,430
that Cheng Huang treated this puppet

463
00:39:43,430 --> 00:39:44,490
very differently.

464
00:39:44,770 --> 00:39:46,890
The paint on it was retouched

465
00:39:46,910 --> 00:39:48,110
after it faded.

466
00:39:48,360 --> 00:39:49,730
It's exquisite.

467
00:39:52,840 --> 00:39:53,680
Hmm...

468
00:39:54,660 --> 00:39:56,040
I got it.

469
00:39:57,130 --> 00:39:59,410
Let's use this puppet as a hostage.

470
00:40:04,320 --> 00:40:05,790
Old thing,

471
00:40:05,820 --> 00:40:07,350
I'll count down from three.

472
00:40:07,390 --> 00:40:08,830
If you don't come out,

473
00:40:08,860 --> 00:40:10,730
I'll destroy this puppet

474
00:40:10,750 --> 00:40:12,640
and twist off her head.

475
00:40:14,290 --> 00:40:15,080
Three.

476
00:40:16,670 --> 00:40:17,500
Two.

477
00:40:20,380 --> 00:40:21,170
One.

478
00:40:38,190 --> 00:40:39,390
If you don't come out,

479
00:40:41,510 --> 00:40:43,150
I'll kiss her.

480
00:40:43,900 --> 00:40:44,810
Ridiculous.

481
00:40:45,510 --> 00:40:46,540
This is an emergency.

482
00:40:46,540 --> 00:40:47,920
It calls for desperate tactics.

483
00:40:47,920 --> 00:40:49,350
This tactic is too desperate.

484
00:40:49,350 --> 00:40:51,150
The desperateness is too tacky.

485
00:40:52,950 --> 00:40:54,610
Are you really not coming out?

486
00:41:17,080 --> 00:41:18,520
You bastard!

487
00:41:27,320 --> 00:41:28,500
Give it back!

488
00:41:29,770 --> 00:41:32,210
Otherwise, none of you can get out.

489
00:41:34,070 --> 00:41:35,150
Well,

490
00:41:35,590 --> 00:41:37,520
I'm not in a hurry to go out.

491
00:41:37,960 --> 00:41:40,030
I just want to hear some legendary gossip.

492
00:41:40,030 --> 00:41:41,640
What's your relationship

493
00:41:41,750 --> 00:41:43,650
with the Original Goddess?

494
00:41:44,790 --> 00:41:47,000
How could a heartless demon

495
00:41:47,150 --> 00:41:49,190
have anything to do with the goddess?

496
00:41:49,190 --> 00:41:50,310
Why not?

497
00:41:50,480 --> 00:41:52,890
Didn't the cruelest demon in the world

498
00:41:53,330 --> 00:41:55,950
also call Zhao Wan'er his sister?

499
00:41:56,320 --> 00:41:58,540
How can you compare with me?

500
00:41:58,910 --> 00:42:01,540
Wan'er and I were really like siblings.

501
00:42:01,570 --> 00:42:02,440
But you...

502
00:42:06,800 --> 00:42:09,200
You secretly painted the goddess's puppet

503
00:42:10,550 --> 00:42:12,860
but cut back on the fabric,

504
00:42:13,250 --> 00:42:14,480
making her seem a bit frivolous.

505
00:42:14,480 --> 00:42:15,290
Shut up!

506
00:42:16,200 --> 00:42:17,340
I'll kill you!

507
00:42:19,120 --> 00:42:19,920
Stop!

508
00:42:22,020 --> 00:42:23,720
Shut up or stop?

509
00:42:24,660 --> 00:42:25,950
Zhu Yan.

510
00:42:39,790 --> 00:42:40,850
Brother Zhuo!

511
00:42:42,500 --> 00:42:43,420
Brother Zhuo.

512
00:42:44,990 --> 00:42:47,020
We came out of the illusion.

513
00:42:53,130 --> 00:42:54,210
I don't think so.

514
00:42:55,650 --> 00:42:56,510
Zhao Yuanzhou,

515
00:42:56,880 --> 00:42:57,870
where are we?

516
00:42:58,590 --> 00:43:00,320
This mountain and stone

517
00:43:00,510 --> 00:43:03,230
is the way from the Wilderness to the Kunlun Gate.

518
00:43:03,230 --> 00:43:05,030
But this is not the Wilderness.

519
00:43:05,440 --> 00:43:07,630
It's just a replica of the Wilderness.

520
00:43:08,920 --> 00:43:11,140
We're still in Cheng Huang's illusion.

521
00:43:14,600 --> 00:43:16,120
Why did you

522
00:43:16,880 --> 00:43:18,010
invite us here?

523
00:43:18,040 --> 00:43:19,770
Didn't you want to know

524
00:43:19,790 --> 00:43:21,580
about the Original Goddess?

525
00:43:21,820 --> 00:43:22,670
No one wants to know

526
00:43:22,670 --> 00:43:24,910
about your stupid love life.

527
00:43:25,350 --> 00:43:26,230
Hurry up and—

528
00:43:26,250 --> 00:43:27,170
I want to know.

529
00:43:38,390 --> 00:43:40,110
The original Baize Token

530
00:43:40,260 --> 00:43:41,920
was divided into two.

531
00:43:41,940 --> 00:43:43,540
The Original Goddess

532
00:43:43,560 --> 00:43:46,200
and the strongest Great Demon of the Wilderness

533
00:43:46,200 --> 00:43:47,750
managed it together.

534
00:43:56,440 --> 00:43:58,370
After the ancient flood,

535
00:43:58,410 --> 00:44:00,220
the gods fell.

536
00:44:00,240 --> 00:44:01,600
The human and demon worlds

537
00:44:01,600 --> 00:44:02,950
fell into chaos.

538
00:44:02,980 --> 00:44:05,260
I was ordered by White Emperor Shaohao

539
00:44:05,390 --> 00:44:07,430
to rule the demons in the Wilderness

540
00:44:07,550 --> 00:44:09,330
and protect all beings.

541
00:44:13,020 --> 00:44:15,030
But as destined by fate,

542
00:44:15,490 --> 00:44:17,590
I, Baize, am a celestial beast

543
00:44:17,760 --> 00:44:20,100
and am immortal,

544
00:44:20,360 --> 00:44:22,170
but I’m willing to sacrifice myself

545
00:44:22,170 --> 00:44:24,090
and transform into the power of Baize

546
00:44:24,090 --> 00:44:26,160
to be passed on in the world.

547
00:44:32,720 --> 00:44:34,110
Each generation, I will choose

548
00:44:34,110 --> 00:44:36,340
the purest human

549
00:44:36,480 --> 00:44:38,550
to control all demons.

550
00:45:18,710 --> 00:45:20,230
Bless everything.

551
00:45:20,250 --> 00:45:21,830
Invulnerable to all evil.

552
00:45:22,110 --> 00:45:23,800
We promise to work together

553
00:45:25,050 --> 00:45:26,840
and guard the Wilderness.

554
00:45:26,880 --> 00:45:28,650
And guard the Wilderness.
