1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,900
departed

2
00:00:05,900 --> 00:00:15,440
Ariadne

3
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:05,000
I'm sorry, but I'm not sure if I can get the best of you.

4
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:10,000
I'm sorry, but I'm not sure if I can get the best of you.

5
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:15,000
I'm sorry, but I'm not sure if I can get the best of you.

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:20,000
I'm sorry, but I'm not sure if I can get the best of you.

7
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:25,000
I'm sorry, but I'm not sure if I can get the best of you.

8
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:30,000
I'm sorry, but I'm not sure if I can get the best of you.

9
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:35,000
I'm sorry, but I'm not sure if I can get the best of you.

10
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:40,000
I'm sorry, but I'm not sure if I can get the best of you.

11
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,560
Queen

12
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:22,000
It's okay.

13
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Why did you ask me to take the 14th version?

14
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
You'll know when you open it.

15
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,000
It should be too suspicious.

16
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
So it must be a man.

17
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
No, no, no.

18
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
No, no, no, no.

19
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,280
No, no, no.

20
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:24,320
No, no, no.

21
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:24,840
See?

22
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:27,280
The real fear is never a big deal.

23
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:28,480
No, no, no.

24
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:30,080
No, no, no.

25
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:31,280
No, no, no.

26
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:32,000
No, no, no.

27
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,360
If you're really afraid,

28
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:34,240
wait for me outside.

29
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:36,120
No.

30
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:37,880
I'm a dancer.

31
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:40,880
No, I'm a doctor.

32
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:42,680
I've done dancing before.

33
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:43,800
I can perform.

34
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:46,800
Are you sure?

35
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:49,960
But I can only perform on the floor.

36
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:50,480
Sky board.

37
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:52,560
No.

38
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:55,240
I'll take my leave.

39
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:56,200
I'll be right back.

40
00:03:56,200 --> 00:03:56,680
Go!

41
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:20,880
I'm done.

42
00:04:22,080 --> 00:04:23,440
The situation in Shijiang

43
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:24,440
is a bit different.

44
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:28,160
Really?

45
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:33,040
They've all been drawn away.

46
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:36,960
Are you listening to me?

47
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:38,640
Your heart has also been drawn away, right?

48
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:53,000
Firecrackers.

49
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,240
One day.

50
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:11,360
sighs.

51
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:15,320
Have you heard of « Rich Times »?

52
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:19,280
I heard it.

53
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:21,280
The sea is golden on the sea.

54
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:24,280
The yellow is a kind of bird that looks like a fox.

55
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:27,280
There are also horns and horns behind it.

56
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:29,280
It means it's long and close to life.

57
00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:34,280
But the yellow in the legend is the bird of the jade.

58
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:36,280
The jade?

59
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:39,280
I'm about the same age as you.

60
00:05:40,280 --> 00:05:45,280
It turns out that this is almost ten thousand years old.

61
00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:48,280
Then it's just like you.

62
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:51,280
I'm much younger than him.

63
00:05:52,280 --> 00:05:55,280
I mean, the sea is a thousand years old.

64
00:05:56,280 --> 00:05:57,280
Just like you.

65
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:05,280
So this is the jade behind the yellow.

66
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:07,280
That's right.

67
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:09,280
This is the jade of the yellow.

68
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:11,280
The jade?

69
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:20,280
The legend says that the jade of the yellow is a kind of bird that looks like a fox.

70
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:22,280
It can help people to achieve their goals.

71
00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:27,280
No matter if it's beauty, wealth, or life,

72
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:29,280
the jade can be achieved.

73
00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:33,280
But they don't know that beauty is sincere.

74
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:36,280
It's to take someone's life as a price.

75
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:42,280
To sacrifice someone's life to achieve their dreams.

76
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:44,280
It's so cruel.

77
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:47,280
It seems that I was right about the previous speculation.

78
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:54,280
These two places are the places where the secret case happened.

79
00:06:56,280 --> 00:06:58,280
If I'm not wrong,

80
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:03,280
there might be the third case here.

81
00:07:04,280 --> 00:07:07,280
And the time is tomorrow.

82
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:10,280
How do you know?

83
00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:14,280
I hope I'm wrong.

84
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:19,280
If it's true...

85
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:23,280
I... I have a pen on my head.

86
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:27,280
Thank you.

87
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:29,280
I'll tell you next time.

88
00:07:42,280 --> 00:07:44,280
If it's true,

89
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:48,280
then this medicine is not good for you.

90
00:07:54,280 --> 00:07:55,280
Wei Xiao.

91
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:02,280
Wei Xiao.

92
00:08:12,280 --> 00:08:13,280
Wei Xiao.

93
00:08:30,280 --> 00:08:31,280
Thank you.

94
00:08:42,280 --> 00:08:43,280
Brother.

95
00:08:44,280 --> 00:08:45,280
Brother.

96
00:08:47,280 --> 00:08:49,280
Isn't your brother dead?

97
00:08:55,280 --> 00:08:56,280
Sister.

98
00:08:57,280 --> 00:08:58,280
Long time no see.

99
00:09:01,280 --> 00:09:02,280
I'm sorry.

100
00:09:03,280 --> 00:09:04,280
I'm sorry.

101
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:06,280
I'm sorry.

102
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:08,280
I'm sorry.

103
00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:10,280
I'm sorry.

104
00:09:11,280 --> 00:09:12,280
Do you miss me?

105
00:09:18,280 --> 00:09:20,280
Has Ah Heng died long ago?

106
00:09:28,280 --> 00:09:29,280
Yes.

107
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:33,280
You killed him personally.

108
00:09:34,280 --> 00:09:37,280
Because you said that you wanted to kill him.

109
00:09:37,280 --> 00:09:40,280
You killed him because you said that I was full of bad habits.

110
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:43,280
You have no way to forgive me.

111
00:09:44,280 --> 00:09:46,280
Isn't that so?

112
00:09:48,280 --> 00:09:49,280
Now,

113
00:09:51,280 --> 00:09:53,280
you're still killing me.

114
00:09:55,280 --> 00:09:58,280
These things are always good memories.

115
00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:03,280
I'll remember them well.

116
00:10:08,280 --> 00:10:10,280
I'll remember them well.

117
00:10:16,280 --> 00:10:18,280
These are still the same old things.

118
00:10:19,280 --> 00:10:21,280
They are always good people for those who are not good.

119
00:10:22,280 --> 00:10:24,280
They are good people for their own good.

120
00:10:24,280 --> 00:10:26,280
What do you want?

121
00:10:26,280 --> 00:10:31,280
I want to draw your heart out.

122
00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:39,280
I'll draw your heart out.

123
00:10:40,280 --> 00:10:42,280
I'll draw your heart out.

124
00:10:43,280 --> 00:10:45,280
I'll draw your heart out.

125
00:10:46,280 --> 00:10:48,280
I'll draw your heart out.

126
00:10:49,280 --> 00:10:51,280
I'll draw your heart out.

127
00:10:52,280 --> 00:10:54,280
I'll draw your heart out.

128
00:10:55,280 --> 00:10:57,280
I'll draw your heart out.

129
00:10:58,280 --> 00:11:00,280
I'll draw your heart out.

130
00:11:01,280 --> 00:11:03,280
I'll draw your heart out.

131
00:11:04,280 --> 00:11:06,280
I'll draw your heart out.

132
00:11:07,280 --> 00:11:09,280
I'll draw your heart out.

133
00:11:10,280 --> 00:11:12,280
I'll draw your heart out.

134
00:11:13,280 --> 00:11:15,280
I'll draw your heart out.

135
00:11:16,280 --> 00:11:18,280
I'll draw your heart out.

136
00:11:19,280 --> 00:11:21,280
I'll draw your heart out.

137
00:11:22,280 --> 00:11:24,280
I'll draw your heart out.

138
00:11:25,280 --> 00:11:27,280
I'll draw your heart out.

139
00:11:28,280 --> 00:11:30,280
I'll draw your heart out.

140
00:11:31,280 --> 00:11:33,280
I'll draw your heart out.

141
00:11:34,280 --> 00:11:36,280
I'll draw your heart out.

142
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:39,280
I'll draw your heart out.

143
00:11:39,280 --> 00:11:41,280
I'll draw your heart out.

144
00:12:04,280 --> 00:12:07,280
I'll draw your heart out.

145
00:12:09,280 --> 00:12:11,280
I'll draw your heart out.

146
00:12:14,280 --> 00:12:15,280
Lord Xiao Du.

147
00:12:16,280 --> 00:12:18,280
You'll be a good doctor.

148
00:12:18,280 --> 00:12:32,560
Do you want to try the

149
00:13:03,560 --> 00:13:05,560
Dream чуть for me?

150
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:12,160
It's cool down

151
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:13,560
and cool down.

152
00:13:13,560 --> 00:13:15,040
I don't care

153
00:13:15,640 --> 00:13:18,840
if theậ I start using

154
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:21,800
is because of vitamin видео.

155
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:24,920
I don' t care

156
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:34,000
I월ai!

157
00:13:44,820 --> 00:13:45,940
Iён compile

158
00:13:45,960 --> 00:13:46,760
Man Li tell the room

159
00:13:48,760 --> 00:13:51,440
What is wrong with you!

160
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:53,520
Not so good

161
00:13:53,960 --> 00:13:54,480
Forget it

162
00:13:54,980 --> 00:13:55,560
It depends on bodies

163
00:13:56,300 --> 00:13:57,660
and mixtures

164
00:13:57,660 --> 00:14:01,660
I have a personality and I have a personality.

165
00:14:01,660 --> 00:14:05,660
Everything is divided into good and bad.

166
00:14:05,660 --> 00:14:09,660
People always say that people have a good personality.

167
00:14:09,660 --> 00:14:13,660
But what they lose is just an external disaster. It's not their own heart.

168
00:14:14,660 --> 00:14:18,660
People always treat the difference as a sin.

169
00:14:18,660 --> 00:14:21,660
That's the prejudice.

170
00:14:22,660 --> 00:14:25,660
Is that so?

171
00:14:26,660 --> 00:14:29,660
But I've never known about demons.

172
00:14:34,660 --> 00:14:36,660
Look at the little mountain god.

173
00:14:36,660 --> 00:14:42,660
Although he is a demon, he also has a heart of compassion.

174
00:14:42,660 --> 00:14:45,660
He is the one who sends the scriptures and the capital.

175
00:14:45,660 --> 00:14:49,660
There is no difference between demons and humans.

176
00:14:49,660 --> 00:14:53,660
There are evil and evil together.

177
00:14:55,660 --> 00:14:58,660
But I have a personality.

178
00:14:58,660 --> 00:15:01,660
I have a personality.

179
00:15:01,660 --> 00:15:04,660
I have a personality.

180
00:15:04,660 --> 00:15:07,660
I have a personality.

181
00:15:07,660 --> 00:15:10,660
I have a personality.

182
00:15:10,660 --> 00:15:13,660
I have a personality.

183
00:15:13,660 --> 00:15:16,660
I have a personality.

184
00:15:16,660 --> 00:15:19,660
I have a personality.

185
00:15:19,660 --> 00:15:22,660
I have a personality.

186
00:15:23,660 --> 00:15:27,660
It's not the world where you are.

187
00:15:35,660 --> 00:15:39,660
Pigmen and lively dogs are everywhere.

188
00:15:39,660 --> 00:15:42,660
It's not like children are young.

189
00:15:42,660 --> 00:15:46,660
I like you.

190
00:15:48,660 --> 00:15:50,660
Yes.

191
00:15:50,660 --> 00:15:59,300
With the wind, our刻画像成长

192
00:15:59,300 --> 00:16:08,100
Why are you still wandering around the old place

193
00:16:20,780 --> 00:16:22,660
Oh會

194
00:16:40,660 --> 00:16:43,780
O형小卓大人竟然送我东西了

195
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:46,420
太阳打西边出来了

196
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:49,040
而且还是个这么好看的鱼配

197
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:51,040
I don't like the man of the thousand.

198
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:55,040
Which one are you?

199
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:58,040
Did I tell you about the formation of the city?

200
00:16:58,040 --> 00:17:01,040
Or did I teach you the magic of the name of the city?

201
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:02,040
What else?

202
00:17:02,040 --> 00:17:05,040
I told you about the magic of the sword.

203
00:17:06,040 --> 00:17:08,040
You guys have a saying.

204
00:17:08,040 --> 00:17:11,040
My brother is a good man.

205
00:17:11,040 --> 00:17:13,040
Don't be so late.

206
00:17:16,040 --> 00:17:18,040
I will kill you.

207
00:17:18,040 --> 00:17:20,040
I can't help it.

208
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:24,040
Please let me know.

209
00:17:48,040 --> 00:17:53,040
Left, right, left, right, left, right, left, right.

210
00:17:53,040 --> 00:17:55,040
Sister.

211
00:17:55,040 --> 00:17:58,040
Don't say that word.

212
00:17:58,040 --> 00:18:00,040
That word?

213
00:18:00,040 --> 00:18:02,040
I only said that word.

214
00:18:02,040 --> 00:18:04,040
Sister.

215
00:18:04,040 --> 00:18:16,040
The police report said that three months ago,

216
00:18:16,040 --> 00:18:18,040
three months ago,

217
00:18:18,040 --> 00:18:22,040
the same method and the same road and foot number

218
00:18:22,040 --> 00:18:25,040
of the same person's life were the same.

219
00:18:25,040 --> 00:18:27,040
My brother Pei Sihe.

220
00:18:27,040 --> 00:18:29,040
When you were on the mission,

221
00:18:29,040 --> 00:18:31,040
you were with Pei Sihe.

222
00:18:31,040 --> 00:18:35,040
Then you resigned from the Chongwu Camp and joined the army.

223
00:18:35,040 --> 00:18:37,040
Why did you kill my brother?

224
00:18:37,040 --> 00:18:40,040
It's not a matter of whether you're guilty or not.

225
00:18:43,040 --> 00:18:45,040
Because he became a demon.

226
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:47,040
How can a person become a demon?

227
00:18:47,040 --> 00:18:49,040
Even if he becomes a demon,

228
00:18:49,040 --> 00:18:51,040
it's not all the demons.

229
00:18:51,040 --> 00:18:53,040
What's the point?

230
00:18:53,040 --> 00:18:55,040
It's not all the demons.

231
00:18:55,040 --> 00:18:57,040
What's the point?

232
00:19:12,040 --> 00:19:14,040
Sister.

233
00:19:14,040 --> 00:19:17,900
Do you want to kill me?

234
00:19:18,300 --> 00:19:19,940
You already know the warning is out of it.

235
00:19:20,140 --> 00:19:29,100
You will loseu From

236
00:19:29,780 --> 00:19:31,580
sin and treason.

237
00:19:32,020 --> 00:19:36,180
I amtaal what's greater than fate

238
00:19:36,700 --> 00:19:37,860
Butahahah

239
00:19:39,420 --> 00:19:41,280
Will you forgive me?

240
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:46,280
If you can't kill Mr. Pei, we'll be the ones to kill him.

241
00:19:48,280 --> 00:19:51,280
Qianqian, I'll just eat it.

242
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:13,280
I'll just eat it.

243
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:29,280
Brother.

244
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:35,280
Qianqian, you just passed away.

245
00:20:36,280 --> 00:20:44,280
You didn't even hear what I said to you.

246
00:20:44,280 --> 00:20:59,280
Sister, I'm dead.

247
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:05,280
I can't do anything for you anymore.

248
00:21:06,280 --> 00:21:10,280
You've never doubted this case?

249
00:21:10,280 --> 00:21:15,280
Of course I have.

250
00:21:22,280 --> 00:21:26,280
I've tried it three times, but it's still the same.

251
00:21:26,280 --> 00:21:29,280
I've checked the result.

252
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:32,280
How did the body handle it?

253
00:21:32,280 --> 00:21:35,280
It's me.

254
00:21:42,280 --> 00:21:45,280
Then your brother we met today,

255
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:48,280
he suddenly recovered.

256
00:21:48,280 --> 00:21:51,280
Recovered?

257
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:55,280
I can't believe there's such a miracle.

258
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:58,280
He didn't recover today.

259
00:21:58,280 --> 00:22:04,280
The one who sent this brother to the prison before was my brother.

260
00:22:18,280 --> 00:22:21,280
Why did he give you this prison?

261
00:22:22,280 --> 00:22:26,280
He must have a grudge.

262
00:22:26,280 --> 00:22:29,280
He wanted you to help him to clear the grudge?

263
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:32,280
No.

264
00:22:32,280 --> 00:22:36,280
He wanted me to know his wildness.

265
00:22:36,280 --> 00:22:39,280
He hated me.

266
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:41,280
He wanted me to be killed.

267
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:44,280
He wanted me to suffer.

268
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:47,280
It's not that.

269
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:52,280
I can smell the smell of the silver.

270
00:22:52,280 --> 00:22:55,280
He has a great connection with the Emperor of the City.

271
00:22:55,280 --> 00:22:59,280
There's a clue to find the Emperor of the City.

272
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:01,280
Why do you look at me?

273
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:03,280
How could I know where the Emperor of the City is?

274
00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:09,280
You said that when you were looking for the suspect.

275
00:23:10,280 --> 00:23:13,280
Now you want to deceive me?

276
00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:22,280
The Emperor of the City is a living being.

277
00:23:22,280 --> 00:23:24,280
He's the one who's sacrificed his life.

278
00:23:24,280 --> 00:23:28,280
The most powerful part of him is the eye.

279
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:34,280
The Emperor is here.

280
00:23:34,280 --> 00:23:37,280
Guan Xiang Tai?

281
00:23:40,280 --> 00:23:43,280
The Emperor of the City is here.

282
00:23:43,280 --> 00:23:46,280
I'll take care of you.

283
00:23:46,280 --> 00:23:49,280
What's wrong?

284
00:23:49,280 --> 00:23:52,280
He's here.

285
00:23:52,280 --> 00:23:55,280
The Emperor of the City is here.

286
00:23:55,280 --> 00:23:57,280
He's here.

287
00:23:57,280 --> 00:24:00,280
He's here.

288
00:24:00,280 --> 00:24:02,280
He's here.

289
00:24:02,280 --> 00:24:04,280
He's here.

290
00:24:04,280 --> 00:24:07,280
He's here.

291
00:24:07,280 --> 00:24:13,280
The Emperor of the City committed a big crime of killing countless people.

292
00:24:16,280 --> 00:24:20,280
But he didn't know why he escaped the punishment of the White-Haired Man.

293
00:24:20,280 --> 00:24:23,280
He escaped the human world.

294
00:24:23,280 --> 00:24:28,280
I don't know what he's plotting behind him.

295
00:24:37,280 --> 00:24:40,280
The Emperor of the City is here.

296
00:24:58,280 --> 00:25:00,280
What?

297
00:25:03,280 --> 00:25:05,280
What?

298
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:08,280
So high?

299
00:25:11,280 --> 00:25:14,280
This Japanese ghost is a bit familiar.

300
00:25:14,280 --> 00:25:16,280
Here.

301
00:25:16,280 --> 00:25:18,280
This Japanese ghost is wrong.

302
00:25:18,280 --> 00:25:21,280
It's not used to mark the time.

303
00:25:21,280 --> 00:25:24,280
Japanese ghosts can be used for a few days.

304
00:25:24,280 --> 00:25:27,280
But they can only be used during the day.

305
00:25:27,280 --> 00:25:31,280
They can be used to mark the night time.

306
00:25:31,280 --> 00:25:33,280
But there are only Japanese ghosts here.

307
00:25:33,280 --> 00:25:36,280
They can't be used during the day.

308
00:25:36,280 --> 00:25:38,280
Then this Japanese ghost is...

309
00:25:38,280 --> 00:25:40,280
It's a entrance.

310
00:25:40,280 --> 00:25:42,280
The Emperor of the City is a witness.

311
00:25:42,280 --> 00:25:46,280
This Japanese ghost is used to mark the night time.

312
00:25:48,280 --> 00:25:50,280
Don't touch it.

313
00:25:55,280 --> 00:25:58,280
The Emperor of the City has been alive for too long.

314
00:25:58,280 --> 00:26:00,280
He's very strong.

315
00:26:00,280 --> 00:26:03,280
We can easily defend ourselves in his territory.

316
00:26:03,280 --> 00:26:05,280
Don't be so obvious.

317
00:26:05,280 --> 00:26:07,280
Tell me what to do.

318
00:26:07,280 --> 00:26:10,280
Didn't Miss Wen Xiao love to sign the red line?

319
00:26:11,280 --> 00:26:13,280
Please sign one for us.

320
00:26:13,280 --> 00:26:15,280
You and me?

321
00:26:17,280 --> 00:26:18,280
I'm so confused.

322
00:26:18,280 --> 00:26:22,280
I mean, use the Fuyao lock to divide us into two teams.

323
00:26:22,280 --> 00:26:24,280
To prevent the separation and the loss.

324
00:26:24,280 --> 00:26:27,280
Especially those young friends.

325
00:26:27,280 --> 00:26:29,280
You're talking about you?

326
00:26:48,280 --> 00:26:50,280
I'm so tired of your neck.

327
00:26:50,280 --> 00:26:53,280
I'm sorry. I'm not a dog.

328
00:26:53,280 --> 00:26:55,280
I like the Sixth Lord.

329
00:26:58,280 --> 00:27:00,280
There are only two teams.

330
00:27:00,280 --> 00:27:02,280
You should have come today.

331
00:27:02,280 --> 00:27:04,280
You should have come today.

332
00:27:04,280 --> 00:27:06,280
You should have come today.

333
00:27:06,280 --> 00:27:08,280
I'm so tired of your neck.

334
00:27:08,280 --> 00:27:10,280
I'm the Sixth Lord.

335
00:27:10,280 --> 00:27:12,280
I'm not a dog.

336
00:27:12,280 --> 00:27:14,280
I'm not a dog.

337
00:27:14,280 --> 00:27:16,280
I'm just a dog.

338
00:27:16,280 --> 00:27:18,280
I'm just a dog.

339
00:27:18,280 --> 00:27:20,280
I'm just a dog.

340
00:27:20,280 --> 00:27:22,280
I'm just a dog.

341
00:27:22,280 --> 00:27:24,280
All right, you stay here.

342
00:27:24,280 --> 00:27:26,280
Don't let anyone come.

343
00:27:27,280 --> 00:27:28,460
Cyclone

344
00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:31,420
We can go now

345
00:27:32,560 --> 00:27:33,560
Bai Jing

346
00:27:33,620 --> 00:27:34,620
Then...

347
00:27:41,540 --> 00:27:42,720
I...

348
00:27:43,460 --> 00:27:44,880
We can do anything

349
00:28:27,280 --> 00:28:29,280
Little Friday

350
00:28:29,320 --> 00:28:30,840
What's the matter

351
00:28:31,920 --> 00:28:32,440
Miss Pei

352
00:28:32,680 --> 00:28:34,600
Where is she

353
00:28:37,360 --> 00:28:39,360
It's Miss Pei

354
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:45,280
Miss Pei

355
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:46,240
What's wrong?

356
00:28:47,680 --> 00:28:47,720
Miss Pei

357
00:28:57,280 --> 00:29:00,840
...

358
00:29:00,940 --> 00:29:06,420
Don't cry, just calm yourself.

359
00:29:06,620 --> 00:29:10,920
Why are you scared?

360
00:29:11,060 --> 00:29:13,620
Ah...

361
00:29:15,260 --> 00:29:20,360
Dad, this is magic.

362
00:29:20,440 --> 00:29:24,380
I want to witnesses, be okay,

363
00:29:24,460 --> 00:29:26,000
Oh...

364
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:28,000
The water is very clean.

365
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:30,000
The water is very clean.

366
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:32,000
The water is very clean.

367
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:34,000
The water is very clean.

368
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:36,000
The water is very clean.

369
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:38,000
The water is very clean.

370
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:40,000
The water is very clean.

371
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:42,000
The water is very clean.

372
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:44,000
The water is very clean.

373
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:46,000
The water is very clean.

374
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:48,000
The water is very clean.

375
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:50,000
The water is very clean.

376
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:52,000
The water is very clean.

377
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,000
The water is very clean.

378
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:56,000
The water is very clean.

379
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,000
The water is very clean.

380
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,000
The water is very clean.

381
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:05,840
Looks very clean.

382
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:08,000
The water is very clean.

383
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,000
The water is very clean.

384
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:16,000
Why would we suddenly come to Tianxiang River?

385
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:19,120
菲冼让

386
00:30:19,120 --> 00:30:21,120
Once upon a time, a proper managed lord of the Zhou Dynasty came back from here?

387
00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:22,320
You..

388
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:26,000
I can tell.

389
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:28,000
Just once.

390
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:30,000
You...

391
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:32,000
This is not the real Tianxiang Pavilion.

392
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:36,000
It's a place where the Emperor of the Emperor has the magic.

393
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,000
I understand.

394
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:40,000
It's like a dream of Auntie Ran.

395
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:44,000
Auntie Ran's dream is much more dangerous.

396
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:50,000
This is a memory of someone.

397
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:52,000
I'm sorry.

398
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:54,000
This is a memory of someone.

399
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:58,000
Yes.

400
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:04,000
I am him.

401
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:24,000
The Heart of the Star

402
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:31,000
The Heart of the Star

403
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:44,000
Whose idea is this?

404
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:46,000
Him.

405
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:48,000
The Heart of the Star

406
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:52,000
Why are you so upset?

407
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:54,000
Two handsome men.

408
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:56,000
Two handsome men.

409
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:58,000
Are you happy?

410
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:00,000
It's obviously because we are the same.

411
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:02,000
Don't be upset.

412
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:12,000
Let's play.

413
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:14,000
Hey.

414
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:16,000
We just got married.

415
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:18,000
We fell in love at the same time.

416
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:22,000
It's better that you do it.

417
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:24,000
It's almost 6 p.m.

418
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:26,000
Let's go.

419
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:28,000
Let's go.

420
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:36,000
Sister.

421
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:40,000
Why are you here?

422
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:42,000
Why are you here?

423
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:48,000
You hid it from me.

424
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:50,000
You secretly joined the Chongwu Camp.

425
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:54,000
Why can't I join the Chongwu Camp?

426
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:56,000
Pei family is a generation of demons.

427
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:58,000
I am the only one in the family.

428
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:00,000
I should inherit the family.

429
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:04,000
But father and grandfather only care about you.

430
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:06,000
They don't care about me at all.

431
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:10,000
They even gave you the hunting palace of the Chuan family.

432
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:26,000
Ah Hong.

433
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:30,000
Nonsense.

434
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:32,000
Look at your body.

435
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:34,000
It's weak and weak.

436
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:36,000
Ah Hong.

437
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:38,000
How can you be so stubborn?

438
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:40,000
Don't be so stubborn.

439
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:44,000
Yes.

440
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:46,000
You can't see me.

441
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:48,000
I feel that I am in a difficult situation.

442
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:52,000
I need to prove to you that

443
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:54,000
I can also hunt demons.

444
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:56,000
Don't be so stubborn.

445
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:02,000
I promised father

446
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:04,000
to take good care of you.

447
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:10,000
I did all this for you.

448
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:12,000
Can you...

449
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:18,000
It's all for you.

450
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:26,000
Since I was a kid,

451
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:30,000
you asked me

452
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:33,000
what I wanted the most.

453
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:38,000
And

454
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:40,000
from the moment I started,

455
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:43,000
people around me

456
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:45,000
repeatedly said this to me.

457
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:49,000
For you.

458
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:52,000
For you.

459
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:55,000
For you.

460
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:02,000
This is

461
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:07,000
just like a family I have been with since I was a kid.

462
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:32,000
Sister.

463
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:34,000
This family

464
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:37,000
is not yours.

465
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:55,000
Sister.

466
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:57,000
One day,

467
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:59,000
I will definitely find out.

468
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:03,000
Better than you.

469
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:06,000
Stronger than you.

470
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:10,000
I will take back everything that belongs to me.

471
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:12,000
I am not a coward.

472
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:14,000
You are not a coward.

473
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:17,000
But you are the only one

474
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:20,000
who can make me feel warm.

475
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:23,000
But how can I not remember

476
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:26,000
how many times the story has been told?

477
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:30,000
I should be the one who took the lead.

478
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:32,000
I will definitely be the one

479
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:34,000
who will organize the future.

480
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:38,000
A'Hong.

481
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:40,000
A'Hong.

482
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:02,000
Sister Pei.

483
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:05,000
Sister Pei.

484
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:07,000
Why did you take so long?

485
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:10,000
Sister Pei.

486
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:21,000
Why did you throw me away?

487
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:24,000
Go and have a look.

488
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:41,000
Sister.

489
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:46,000
Do you want to know

490
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:48,000
why I became a demon?

491
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:51,000
I don't know.

492
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:54,000
You never told me.

493
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:57,000
Sister Pei.

494
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:59,000
You are talking to me.

495
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:05,000
This life is so scary.

496
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:07,000
This life is so scary.

497
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:11,000
This life is so scary.

498
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:14,000
He knows why I became a demon.

499
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:16,000
Is he talking?

500
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:18,000
Why didn't I hear it?

501
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:38,000
Sister Pei.

502
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:40,000
Sister Pei.

503
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:42,000
Where are you, Sister Pei?

504
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:46,000
Didn't you just throw me away?

505
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:51,000
Xiaozhu, please.

506
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:53,000
Xiaozhu.

507
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:55,000
Xiaozhu, save me.

508
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:57,000
Xiaozhu.

509
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:59,000
Xiaozhu.

510
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:01,000
Xiaozhu, save me.

511
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:30,000
Xiaozhu.

512
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:36,000
What a coincidence.

513
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:59,000
The girl who just danced is gone.

514
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:04,000
Where is she?

515
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:30,000
Why are you so old?

516
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:35,000
What?

517
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:41,000
You men don't understand.

518
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:44,000
It's just that she is in a bad mood.

519
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:46,000
She is in a new dance on the stage.

520
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:48,000
She can't find a good time to marry.

521
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:49,000
She is fine now.

522
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:50,000
She is fine now.

523
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:53,000
Now, she is so young and beautiful.

524
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:55,000
The flowers are so blue.

525
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:57,000
The hot weather is not known to the summer.

526
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:59,000
The flowers are so beautiful.

527
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:01,000
The mountains are so beautiful.

528
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:03,000
How hard is it?

529
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:08,000
Beautiful.

530
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:13,000
She should be the one who only misses the snow and frost of the plum blossoms.

531
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:16,000
She is so self-sufficient.

532
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:20,000
She is not the flower that is due to others' decision.

533
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:22,000
Buy some for her.

534
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:27,000
I hope that God-fe declared one.

535
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:29,000
May my from Canada,

536
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:37,000
papal and virgin begetful in our life,

537
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:39,500
and at the end,

538
00:41:39,500 --> 00:41:41,000
be the pain of the world

539
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:43,000
if be the letter of flowers.

540
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:50,000
She is the Emperor.

541
00:41:58,000 --> 00:41:59,000
I understand.

542
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:03,000
The Emperor is looking for someone who has a obsession in the world.

543
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:06,000
He promises to fulfill his wish for the other person.

544
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:08,000
As long as the other person says he is willing,

545
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:11,000
there will be a person.

546
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:12,000
He is a person.

547
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:45,000
Do you like her?

548
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:54,000
These humans...

549
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:57,000
These humans are not human beings.

550
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:00,000
They are like humans.

551
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:03,000
They won't get hurt or die.

552
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:06,000
They can be healed if they are sick.

553
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:10,000
But they are not like humans.

554
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:15,000
They will be happy and hurt if they have memories.

555
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:21,000
So they are not human beings.

556
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:30,000
I know who you are.

557
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:32,000
I am...

558
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:35,000
You are the Emperor.

559
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:43,000
Why do you want to make Ah Heng a good person?

560
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:47,000
It's not me.

561
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:50,000
It's him.

562
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:53,000
I just heard his voice.

563
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:56,000
I just want to fulfill it for him.

564
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:58,000
Voice?

565
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:02,000
It's because you are too drunk.

566
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:08,000
You are too high.

567
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:12,000
So you never heard my voice.

568
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:16,000
You probably never heard it.

569
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:21,000
Every time I go to a place,

570
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:26,000
I hear the voice of the people.

571
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:33,000
Then I choose the strongest person.

572
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:36,000
For him,

573
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:42,000
your brother's obsession is far more important.

574
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:46,000
Do you want to know what it is?

575
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:52,000
I know.

576
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:57,000
He wants to be stronger.

577
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:01,000
He wants to surpass me.

578
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:03,000
He wants to be with me.

579
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:10,000
He wants to take back what he should have.

580
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:15,000
It's a pity.

581
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:18,000
People are blind.

582
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:21,000
They can see the mountains and rivers.

583
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:24,000
But they can't see the people around them.

584
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:28,000
They are so secretive.

585
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:36,000
They can't see the people around them.

586
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:31,000
They don't like me.

587
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:44,000
But you have to become stronger.

588
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:47,000
So you can protect yourself.

589
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:00,000
Bye.

590
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:14,000
Look.

591
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:25,000
Luo Jun is beautiful, but he doesn't change his heart.

592
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:30,000
It's not suitable for me.

593
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:00,000
What's wrong?

594
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:03,000
Are you disappointed?

595
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:08,000
I can fulfill your wish.

596
00:48:58,000 --> 00:48:59,000
I'm sorry.

597
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:01,000
I'm sorry.

598
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:03,000
I'm sorry.

599
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:05,000
I'm sorry.

600
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:07,000
I'm sorry.

601
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:09,000
I'm sorry.

602
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:11,000
I'm sorry.

603
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:13,000
I'm sorry.

604
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:15,000
I'm sorry.

605
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:17,000
I'm sorry.

606
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:19,000
I'm sorry.

607
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:21,000
I'm sorry.

608
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:23,000
I'm sorry.

609
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:25,000
I'm sorry.

610
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:27,000
I'm sorry.

611
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:29,000
I'm sorry.

612
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:31,000
I'm sorry.

613
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:33,000
I'm sorry.

614
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:35,000
I'm sorry.

615
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:37,000
I'm sorry.

616
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:39,000
I'm sorry.

617
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:41,000
I'm sorry.

618
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:43,000
I'm sorry.

619
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:45,000
I'm sorry.

620
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:47,000
I'm sorry.

621
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:49,000
I'm sorry.

622
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:51,000
I'm sorry.

623
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:53,000
I'm sorry.

624
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:55,000
I'm sorry.

625
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:57,000
I'm sorry.
