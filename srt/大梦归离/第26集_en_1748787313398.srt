1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,120
"'Between us, there's a pain in the dark'

2
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:24,640
What do you want to know?

3
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:28,020
I want something special

4
00:00:28,020 --> 00:00:30,020
I'm sorry, but I'm sorry.

5
00:00:30,020 --> 00:00:32,020
I'm sorry.

6
00:00:32,020 --> 00:00:34,020
I'm sorry.

7
00:00:34,020 --> 00:00:36,020
I'm sorry.

8
00:00:36,020 --> 00:00:38,020
I'm sorry.

9
00:00:38,020 --> 00:00:40,020
I'm sorry.

10
00:00:40,020 --> 00:00:42,020
I'm sorry.

11
00:00:42,020 --> 00:00:44,020
I'm sorry.

12
00:00:44,020 --> 00:00:46,020
I'm sorry.

13
00:00:46,020 --> 00:00:48,020
I'm sorry.

14
00:00:48,020 --> 00:00:50,020
I'm sorry.

15
00:00:50,020 --> 00:00:52,020
I'm sorry.

16
00:00:52,020 --> 00:00:54,020
I'm sorry.

17
00:00:54,020 --> 00:00:56,020
I'm sorry.

18
00:00:56,020 --> 00:00:58,020
I'm sorry.

19
00:00:58,020 --> 00:01:00,020
I'm sorry.

20
00:01:00,020 --> 00:01:02,020
I'm sorry.

21
00:01:02,020 --> 00:01:04,020
I'm sorry.

22
00:01:04,020 --> 00:01:06,020
I'm sorry.

23
00:01:06,020 --> 00:01:08,020
I'm sorry.

24
00:01:08,020 --> 00:01:10,020
I'm sorry.

25
00:01:10,020 --> 00:01:12,020
I'm sorry.

26
00:01:12,020 --> 00:01:14,020
I'm sorry.

27
00:01:14,020 --> 00:01:16,020
I'm sorry.

28
00:01:16,020 --> 00:01:18,020
I'm sorry.

29
00:01:18,020 --> 00:01:20,020
I'm sorry.

30
00:01:20,020 --> 00:01:22,020
I'm sorry.

31
00:01:22,020 --> 00:01:24,020
I'm sorry.

32
00:01:24,020 --> 00:01:26,020
I'm sorry.

33
00:01:26,020 --> 00:01:28,020
I'm sorry.

34
00:01:28,020 --> 00:01:30,020
I'm sorry.

35
00:01:30,020 --> 00:01:32,020
I'm sorry.

36
00:01:32,020 --> 00:01:34,020
Can you believe me?

37
00:01:34,020 --> 00:01:36,020
No.

38
00:01:36,020 --> 00:01:38,020
No.

39
00:01:38,020 --> 00:01:40,020
I'm sorry.

40
00:01:40,020 --> 00:01:42,020
I'm sorry.

41
00:01:42,020 --> 00:01:44,020
I'm sorry.

42
00:01:44,020 --> 00:01:46,020
I'm sorry.

43
00:01:46,020 --> 00:01:48,020
She's going to be here.

44
00:01:48,020 --> 00:01:50,020
Don't tell me you're here.

45
00:01:50,020 --> 00:01:52,020
We have to catch her.

46
00:01:52,020 --> 00:01:54,020
Where's Xiao Zhuo?

47
00:01:56,020 --> 00:01:58,020
He's dead.

48
00:01:59,020 --> 00:02:00,020
He's dead.

49
00:02:06,020 --> 00:02:07,020
Everyone.

50
00:02:08,020 --> 00:02:10,020
Chong Wuying has caught the last-minute murderer.

51
00:02:10,020 --> 00:02:12,020
He's the murderer.

52
00:02:21,020 --> 00:02:24,020
He's the monster Chong Wuying caught.

53
00:02:24,020 --> 00:02:26,020
Aoying.

54
00:02:26,020 --> 00:02:28,020
Chong Wuying.

55
00:02:37,020 --> 00:02:39,020
Aoying is the best.

56
00:02:40,020 --> 00:02:42,020
He can be anyone.

57
00:02:42,020 --> 00:02:44,020
The one who killed Prime Minister was him.

58
00:02:45,020 --> 00:02:47,020
He finally caught Chong Wuying.

59
00:02:48,020 --> 00:02:50,020
Chong Wuying is still the best.

60
00:02:51,020 --> 00:02:52,020
Yes.

61
00:02:52,020 --> 00:02:54,020
He's so good at catching.

62
00:02:54,020 --> 00:02:56,020
Chong Wuying is protected.

63
00:02:56,020 --> 00:02:57,020
The monster is dead.

64
00:02:57,020 --> 00:02:58,020
No.

65
00:02:59,020 --> 00:03:00,020
He's not Aoying.

66
00:03:05,020 --> 00:03:09,020
He should be the Aoying monster that was killed by Prime Minister.

67
00:03:11,020 --> 00:03:13,020
But why did Prime Minister want to help us?

68
00:03:13,020 --> 00:03:16,020
He must be thinking about the Yun Guang Sword of Prime Minister.

69
00:03:17,020 --> 00:03:19,020
Otherwise, he can't kill me.

70
00:03:19,020 --> 00:03:20,020
He's guilty of my guilt.

71
00:03:20,020 --> 00:03:21,020
So,

72
00:03:21,020 --> 00:03:23,020
he can't let Xiao Zhuo get in trouble.

73
00:04:51,020 --> 00:04:52,020
I'm sorry.

74
00:04:52,020 --> 00:04:53,020
I'm sorry.

75
00:04:53,020 --> 00:04:54,020
I'm sorry.

76
00:04:54,020 --> 00:04:55,020
I'm sorry.

77
00:04:55,020 --> 00:04:56,020
I'm sorry.

78
00:04:56,020 --> 00:04:57,020
I'm sorry.

79
00:04:57,020 --> 00:04:58,020
I'm sorry.

80
00:04:58,020 --> 00:04:59,020
I'm sorry.

81
00:04:59,020 --> 00:05:00,020
I'm sorry.

82
00:05:00,020 --> 00:05:01,020
I'm sorry.

83
00:05:01,020 --> 00:05:02,020
I'm sorry.

84
00:05:02,020 --> 00:05:03,020
I'm sorry.

85
00:05:03,020 --> 00:05:04,020
I'm sorry.

86
00:05:04,020 --> 00:05:05,020
I'm sorry.

87
00:05:05,020 --> 00:05:06,020
I'm sorry.

88
00:05:06,020 --> 00:05:07,020
I'm sorry.

89
00:05:07,020 --> 00:05:08,020
I'm sorry.

90
00:05:08,020 --> 00:05:09,020
I'm sorry.

91
00:05:09,020 --> 00:05:10,020
I'm sorry.

92
00:05:10,020 --> 00:05:11,020
I'm sorry.

93
00:05:11,020 --> 00:05:12,020
I'm sorry.

94
00:05:12,020 --> 00:05:13,020
I'm sorry.

95
00:05:13,020 --> 00:05:14,020
I'm sorry.

96
00:05:14,020 --> 00:05:15,020
I'm sorry.

97
00:05:15,020 --> 00:05:16,020
I'm sorry.

98
00:05:16,020 --> 00:05:17,020
I'm sorry.

99
00:05:17,020 --> 00:05:18,020
I'm sorry.

100
00:05:18,020 --> 00:05:19,020
I'm sorry.

101
00:05:19,020 --> 00:05:20,020
I'm sorry.

102
00:05:20,020 --> 00:05:21,020
I'm sorry.

103
00:05:50,020 --> 00:05:51,020
I'm sorry.

104
00:06:21,020 --> 00:06:22,020
It's hard to accept.

105
00:06:23,020 --> 00:06:24,020
Right?

106
00:06:30,020 --> 00:06:31,020
It's hard to accept, too.

107
00:06:34,020 --> 00:06:35,020
Right?

108
00:06:45,020 --> 00:06:46,020
So, you said that

109
00:06:46,020 --> 00:06:47,020
you would kill me.

110
00:06:47,020 --> 00:06:48,020
I'm sorry.

111
00:06:48,020 --> 00:06:49,020
I'm sorry.

112
00:06:49,020 --> 00:06:51,020
It turns out that when you were out of control,

113
00:06:53,020 --> 00:06:54,020
it was like

114
00:06:55,020 --> 00:06:58,020
a deep dream.

115
00:06:59,020 --> 00:07:01,020
A fear of being heartless.

116
00:07:03,020 --> 00:07:04,020
It's okay.

117
00:07:06,020 --> 00:07:07,020
It's all over.

118
00:07:10,020 --> 00:07:11,020
Zhang Yunchou,

119
00:07:15,020 --> 00:07:16,020
I understand you now.

120
00:07:20,020 --> 00:07:21,020
Say goodbye.

121
00:07:21,020 --> 00:07:22,020
Goodbye.

122
00:07:27,020 --> 00:07:28,020
Long wait?

123
00:07:28,020 --> 00:07:30,020
I have something else to tell you.

124
00:07:32,020 --> 00:07:33,020
Why do you want to die,

125
00:07:35,020 --> 00:07:38,020
afterלq you?

126
00:07:40,020 --> 00:07:42,020
There are a lot of

127
00:07:43,020 --> 00:07:44,020
cries,

128
00:07:46,020 --> 00:07:48,020
most of them when it's a secret.

129
00:07:49,020 --> 00:07:54,020
I know I've changed you.

130
00:07:57,020 --> 00:07:58,020
I'm making it up.

131
00:08:05,020 --> 00:08:09,020
I never thought that one day,

132
00:08:11,020 --> 00:08:13,020
you would become a demon.

133
00:08:20,020 --> 00:08:22,020
You killed your own loved one

134
00:08:23,020 --> 00:08:25,020
because of your own time.

135
00:08:26,020 --> 00:08:28,020
This shadow has been holding you.

136
00:08:29,020 --> 00:08:30,020
You can't escape.

137
00:08:31,020 --> 00:08:34,020
If I could feel these earlier,

138
00:08:35,020 --> 00:08:38,020
maybe I could put down the cloud gun.

139
00:08:45,020 --> 00:08:46,020
But now,

140
00:08:46,020 --> 00:08:48,020
the sword is broken.

141
00:08:49,020 --> 00:08:50,640
Maybe it's God's carelessness and

142
00:08:51,020 --> 00:08:53,020
the wishful thinking.

143
00:08:55,020 --> 00:08:57,020
Have you made your decision?

144
00:08:58,020 --> 00:08:59,020
Or else,

145
00:09:01,020 --> 00:09:02,020
if I really kill you,

146
00:09:04,020 --> 00:09:05,020
I will regret it.

147
00:09:07,020 --> 00:09:08,020
I can't kill him.

148
00:09:11,020 --> 00:09:12,020
Yinglong's words

149
00:09:13,020 --> 00:09:14,020
seem to be wrong.

150
00:09:14,020 --> 00:09:15,020
No.

151
00:09:18,020 --> 00:09:20,020
Yinglong's words are never wrong.

152
00:09:21,020 --> 00:09:22,020
Because those words

153
00:09:24,020 --> 00:09:25,020
are not words.

154
00:09:32,020 --> 00:09:34,020
I seem to have said too much.

155
00:09:35,020 --> 00:09:37,020
I don't usually draw so much.

156
00:09:38,020 --> 00:09:40,020
It should be the blood of the monster.

157
00:09:41,020 --> 00:09:43,020
He must be a person who draws a lot of blood.

158
00:09:44,020 --> 00:09:45,020
It's not a monster.

159
00:09:47,020 --> 00:09:49,020
Have you ever heard of a saying?

160
00:09:50,020 --> 00:09:51,020
A person is born to be human.

161
00:09:52,020 --> 00:09:53,020
A person is born to be human.

162
00:09:54,020 --> 00:09:55,020
A person is born to be a demon.

163
00:09:57,020 --> 00:09:58,020
A person is born to be human.

164
00:10:01,020 --> 00:10:02,020
It's not only pure,

165
00:10:03,020 --> 00:10:05,020
but it's also blood.

166
00:10:06,020 --> 00:10:08,020
We are more like animals.

167
00:10:09,020 --> 00:10:10,020
We want to eat when we are hungry.

168
00:10:10,020 --> 00:10:11,020
But when we are hungry,

169
00:10:12,020 --> 00:10:13,020
when we are in danger,

170
00:10:14,020 --> 00:10:15,020
we will be out of the prison.

171
00:10:17,020 --> 00:10:18,020
And humans are animals.

172
00:10:19,020 --> 00:10:20,020
But in the long run,

173
00:10:22,020 --> 00:10:23,020
we have become civilization.

174
00:10:24,020 --> 00:10:25,020
We have become good and evil.

175
00:10:26,020 --> 00:10:27,020
We have become law and order.

176
00:10:31,020 --> 00:10:32,020
So,

177
00:10:33,020 --> 00:10:34,020
humans

178
00:10:35,020 --> 00:10:36,020
are made by

179
00:10:37,020 --> 00:10:38,020
what many people do.

180
00:10:38,020 --> 00:10:39,020
They are made by humans.

181
00:10:41,020 --> 00:10:42,020
They are like soldiers.

182
00:10:43,020 --> 00:10:44,020
So,

183
00:10:45,020 --> 00:10:46,020
what do you want to be?

184
00:10:47,020 --> 00:10:48,020
What do you want to do?

185
00:10:51,020 --> 00:10:52,020
What do you want to be?

186
00:10:53,020 --> 00:10:54,020
What do you want to do?

187
00:10:59,020 --> 00:11:00,020
Why do you suddenly have such a good taste?

188
00:11:03,020 --> 00:11:04,020
You know me better.

189
00:11:05,020 --> 00:11:06,020
These words

190
00:11:06,020 --> 00:11:08,020
are actually what Wen Xiao told me.

191
00:11:09,020 --> 00:11:10,020
It's not good.

192
00:11:13,020 --> 00:11:14,020
So,

193
00:11:15,020 --> 00:11:16,020
even if you become a demon,

194
00:11:16,020 --> 00:11:17,020
it's nothing.

195
00:11:19,020 --> 00:11:20,020
The same is true.

196
00:11:22,020 --> 00:11:23,020
The truth is the world.

197
00:11:24,020 --> 00:11:25,020
The truth is the world.

198
00:11:27,020 --> 00:11:28,020
What about you?

199
00:11:29,020 --> 00:11:30,020
What about me?

200
00:11:31,020 --> 00:11:32,020
You want to be a demon,

201
00:11:33,020 --> 00:11:34,020
or a human?

202
00:11:34,020 --> 00:11:35,020
I

203
00:11:37,020 --> 00:11:38,020
have never

204
00:11:40,020 --> 00:11:42,020
changed from the beginning to the end.

205
00:11:45,020 --> 00:11:46,020
I have always been

206
00:11:49,020 --> 00:11:51,020
a demon who begs for death.

207
00:11:56,020 --> 00:11:58,020
The demon that I know is trying to be a demon.

208
00:11:59,020 --> 00:12:00,020
I hope that it will be old.

209
00:12:01,020 --> 00:12:03,020
You are really a demon.

210
00:12:06,020 --> 00:12:07,020
Brother,

211
00:12:08,020 --> 00:12:09,020
am I

212
00:12:09,020 --> 00:12:10,020
a demon who has

213
00:12:10,020 --> 00:12:11,020
made myself a demon?

214
00:12:17,020 --> 00:12:19,020
It doesn't matter if you become a demon.

215
00:12:20,020 --> 00:12:21,020
Your eyes will deceive people,

216
00:12:22,020 --> 00:12:23,020
but your heart

217
00:12:24,020 --> 00:12:25,020
will tell you the answer.

218
00:12:27,020 --> 00:12:29,020
We will always be with you.

219
00:12:31,020 --> 00:12:32,020
In English,

220
00:12:33,020 --> 00:12:34,020
it means

221
00:12:34,020 --> 00:12:35,020
a human,

222
00:12:36,020 --> 00:12:37,020
a god,

223
00:12:38,020 --> 00:12:39,020
a demon.

224
00:12:40,020 --> 00:12:41,020
A demon who is a demon.

225
00:12:42,020 --> 00:12:43,020
A family.

226
00:12:45,020 --> 00:12:46,020
We are all family.

227
00:12:49,020 --> 00:12:50,020
Xiao Chen,

228
00:12:52,020 --> 00:12:53,020
do you know that

229
00:12:53,020 --> 00:12:55,020
most people are very good at using the word

230
00:12:55,020 --> 00:12:56,020
Chenzi?

231
00:12:56,020 --> 00:12:57,020
I know.

232
00:12:58,020 --> 00:13:00,020
Because Chenzi is too big,

233
00:13:00,020 --> 00:13:02,020
he is fighting against the king's power.

234
00:13:02,020 --> 00:13:04,020
The general's life is under pressure.

235
00:13:06,020 --> 00:13:07,020
But father

236
00:13:08,020 --> 00:13:10,020
insisted on using Chenzi to make you famous.

237
00:13:11,020 --> 00:13:12,020
Father said

238
00:13:13,020 --> 00:13:14,020
Chenzi's meaning

239
00:13:15,020 --> 00:13:17,020
is actually the word of the important person.

240
00:13:18,020 --> 00:13:19,020
There is no word

241
00:13:20,020 --> 00:13:21,020
that can be used to block the rain.

242
00:13:22,020 --> 00:13:23,020
There is no word

243
00:13:24,020 --> 00:13:25,020
that is false.

244
00:13:28,020 --> 00:13:29,020
But,

245
00:13:30,020 --> 00:13:31,020
you are the one

246
00:13:32,020 --> 00:13:33,020
who can make me famous.

247
00:13:35,020 --> 00:13:36,020
Please.

248
00:13:42,020 --> 00:13:44,020
I may lose you.

249
00:13:45,020 --> 00:13:47,020
The demon is getting stronger.

250
00:13:49,020 --> 00:13:50,020
I may not be able to

251
00:13:51,020 --> 00:13:52,020
make you famous.

252
00:13:53,020 --> 00:13:54,020
I will make you famous.

253
00:13:55,020 --> 00:13:56,020
I may not be able to

254
00:13:58,020 --> 00:13:59,020
complete your wish.

255
00:14:02,020 --> 00:14:03,020
I am not afraid of death.

256
00:14:05,020 --> 00:14:07,020
I just hope that before I die,

257
00:14:08,020 --> 00:14:09,020
I can rebuild the Cloud Sword.

258
00:14:11,020 --> 00:14:12,020
At least,

259
00:14:13,020 --> 00:14:14,020
I can save Xiao Qiu.

260
00:14:16,020 --> 00:14:17,020
After I die,

261
00:14:18,020 --> 00:14:20,020
remember to take good care of me.

262
00:14:21,020 --> 00:14:22,020
My Lord,

263
00:14:23,020 --> 00:14:26,020
what is the most annoying thing in the forest?

264
00:14:27,020 --> 00:14:28,020
Your journey is not to the end.

265
00:14:29,020 --> 00:14:30,020
You have to keep going forward.

266
00:14:32,020 --> 00:14:33,020
Let's go together.

267
00:14:52,020 --> 00:14:53,020
I will not let you go.

268
00:14:54,020 --> 00:14:55,020
I will not let you go.

269
00:14:56,020 --> 00:14:57,020
I will not let you go.

270
00:14:58,020 --> 00:14:59,020
I will not let you go.

271
00:15:00,020 --> 00:15:01,020
I will not let you go.

272
00:15:02,020 --> 00:15:03,020
I will not let you go.

273
00:15:04,020 --> 00:15:05,020
I will not let you go.

274
00:15:06,020 --> 00:15:07,020
I will not let you go.

275
00:15:08,020 --> 00:15:09,020
I will not let you go.

276
00:15:10,020 --> 00:15:11,020
I will not let you go.

277
00:15:12,020 --> 00:15:13,020
I will not let you go.

278
00:15:14,020 --> 00:15:15,020
I will not let you go.

279
00:15:16,020 --> 00:15:17,020
I will not let you go.

280
00:15:18,020 --> 00:15:19,020
I will not let you go.

281
00:15:20,020 --> 00:15:21,020
I will not let you go.

282
00:15:23,020 --> 00:15:24,020
I will not let you go.

283
00:15:25,020 --> 00:15:26,020
I will not let you go.

284
00:15:30,020 --> 00:15:31,020
Why are you so old?

285
00:15:32,020 --> 00:15:33,020
Do you still want to eat so much?

286
00:15:35,020 --> 00:15:37,020
He said he entrusted you to me.

287
00:15:38,020 --> 00:15:39,020
I don't know if he wants me to marry you.

288
00:15:42,020 --> 00:15:43,020
Nonsense.

289
00:15:46,020 --> 00:15:47,020
He lied to you.

290
00:15:48,020 --> 00:15:49,020
He didn't say that.

291
00:15:50,020 --> 00:15:52,020
I know he must think so.

292
00:15:53,020 --> 00:15:54,020
He wants me to take care of you.

293
00:15:56,020 --> 00:15:57,020
Protect you.

294
00:15:58,020 --> 00:15:59,020
Maybe for him,

295
00:16:01,020 --> 00:16:02,020
the most caring,

296
00:16:03,020 --> 00:16:04,020
the most worried one,

297
00:16:06,020 --> 00:16:07,020
only you.

298
00:16:16,020 --> 00:16:17,020
Can you two have a good talk?

299
00:16:20,020 --> 00:16:21,020
You.

300
00:16:22,020 --> 00:16:23,020
You should be happy

301
00:16:24,020 --> 00:16:25,020
for your own injury.

302
00:16:32,020 --> 00:16:33,020
Let me see.

303
00:16:49,020 --> 00:16:50,020
Is there

304
00:16:51,020 --> 00:16:52,020
no one

305
00:16:53,020 --> 00:16:54,020
who can help you?

306
00:17:20,020 --> 00:17:21,020
I am a medicine.

307
00:17:22,020 --> 00:17:24,020
I can heal immediately.

308
00:17:25,020 --> 00:17:26,020
No need to take medicine.

309
00:17:35,020 --> 00:17:36,020
Some injuries are not good.

310
00:17:41,020 --> 00:17:43,020
Are you talking about the ones on my back?

311
00:17:45,020 --> 00:17:46,020
No.

312
00:17:49,020 --> 00:17:52,020
It's the one on your back.

313
00:18:19,020 --> 00:18:20,020
By the way,

314
00:18:22,020 --> 00:18:26,020
the enemy is in danger.

315
00:18:27,020 --> 00:18:28,020
So before that,

316
00:18:30,020 --> 00:18:32,020
we need to finish one thing.

317
00:18:34,020 --> 00:18:35,020
I know.

318
00:18:36,020 --> 00:18:37,020
We will also go to Kunlun Mountain

319
00:18:38,020 --> 00:18:39,020
to start the Star Formation.

320
00:18:40,020 --> 00:18:41,020
To repair the Great Reckless.

321
00:18:42,020 --> 00:18:43,020
All the people are back.

322
00:18:44,020 --> 00:18:45,020
We will take care of them.

323
00:18:46,020 --> 00:18:48,020
We will do everything we can.

324
00:18:49,020 --> 00:18:51,020
Let's go.

325
00:19:19,020 --> 00:19:20,020
The Great Reckless

326
00:19:21,020 --> 00:19:22,020
The Great Reckless

327
00:19:23,020 --> 00:19:24,020
The Great Reckless

328
00:19:25,020 --> 00:19:26,020
The Great Reckless

329
00:19:27,020 --> 00:19:28,020
The Great Reckless

330
00:19:29,020 --> 00:19:30,020
The Great Reckless

331
00:19:31,020 --> 00:19:32,020
The Great Reckless

332
00:19:33,020 --> 00:19:34,020
The Great Reckless

333
00:19:35,020 --> 00:19:36,020
The Great Reckless

334
00:19:37,020 --> 00:19:38,020
The Great Reckless

335
00:19:39,020 --> 00:19:40,020
The Great Reckless

336
00:19:41,020 --> 00:19:42,020
The Great Reckless

337
00:19:43,020 --> 00:19:44,020
The Great Reckless

338
00:19:45,020 --> 00:19:46,020
The Great Reckless

339
00:19:47,020 --> 00:19:48,020
The Great Reckless

340
00:19:50,020 --> 00:19:51,020
The Great Reckless

341
00:19:59,020 --> 00:20:00,020
The Great Reckless

342
00:20:11,020 --> 00:20:12,020
My lady...

343
00:20:19,020 --> 00:20:21,020
The Great Moon

344
00:20:29,020 --> 00:20:32,020
Great, Kunlun Gate has finally been restored

345
00:20:39,020 --> 00:20:40,020
What's wrong with you?

346
00:20:41,020 --> 00:20:44,020
Nothing, let's go to the border together

347
00:20:45,020 --> 00:20:47,020
Don't you want us to go to the border together?

348
00:20:49,020 --> 00:20:51,020
The Great Moon

349
00:20:59,020 --> 00:21:01,020
You go first, I'll take them out

350
00:21:02,020 --> 00:21:03,020
Because...

351
00:21:03,020 --> 00:21:07,020
Lord Xiaozhou, the border of the mountain is not so easy to break

352
00:21:07,020 --> 00:21:08,020
But you...

353
00:21:08,020 --> 00:21:10,020
I'll kill the Great Moon, you go first

354
00:21:10,020 --> 00:21:12,020
Okay, go

355
00:21:50,020 --> 00:21:51,020
Go

356
00:22:03,020 --> 00:22:05,020
Pass through this cave

357
00:22:05,020 --> 00:22:07,020
It's the forbidden place of the Ice Tribe

358
00:22:07,020 --> 00:22:09,020
The Seven-Temperature Cave

359
00:22:13,020 --> 00:22:14,020
Xiaozhou

360
00:22:19,020 --> 00:22:22,020
These are all the time of the beast

361
00:22:40,020 --> 00:22:43,020
Why do so many beast want to break into the ice tribe?

362
00:22:43,020 --> 00:22:45,020
What's inside?

363
00:22:45,020 --> 00:22:48,020
What can make the beast to be dangerous?

364
00:22:48,020 --> 00:22:50,020
It must be something very valuable

365
00:22:51,020 --> 00:22:53,020
The Great Moon has a legend

366
00:22:53,020 --> 00:22:55,020
It says that the ice tribe's forbidden place

367
00:22:56,020 --> 00:22:58,020
is hidden in a treasure

368
00:22:59,020 --> 00:23:01,020
A treasure?

369
00:23:02,020 --> 00:23:03,020
Someone said

370
00:23:04,020 --> 00:23:07,020
it can be used to kill the beast

371
00:23:07,020 --> 00:23:08,020
Someone also said

372
00:23:09,020 --> 00:23:12,020
it can improve the mysterious fairy tale of the previous year

373
00:23:12,020 --> 00:23:14,020
and also have the most advanced way

374
00:23:16,020 --> 00:23:18,020
There is a treasure inside

375
00:23:19,020 --> 00:23:21,020
It can satisfy any wish of yours

376
00:23:46,020 --> 00:23:48,020
They still ran away

377
00:23:49,020 --> 00:23:51,020
Do you want to continue chasing the forbidden place of the Ice Tribe?

378
00:23:52,020 --> 00:23:53,020
No

379
00:23:55,020 --> 00:23:57,020
The forbidden place of the Ice Tribe

380
00:23:57,020 --> 00:23:59,020
is limitless

381
00:23:59,020 --> 00:24:01,020
We don't have to risk it

382
00:24:02,020 --> 00:24:05,020
What if they really find a way to repair the Cloud Sword?

383
00:24:07,020 --> 00:24:08,020
Do you know

384
00:24:09,020 --> 00:24:11,020
why the Ice Tribe is so dangerous?

385
00:24:11,020 --> 00:24:12,020
Because

386
00:24:12,020 --> 00:24:15,020
there is a monster that has been alive

387
00:24:18,020 --> 00:24:20,020
from the ancient times

388
00:24:24,020 --> 00:24:26,020
Wait

389
00:24:28,020 --> 00:24:29,020
What's wrong?

390
00:24:30,020 --> 00:24:32,020
The Cloud Sword is my treasure

391
00:24:33,020 --> 00:24:34,020
I'm sorry

392
00:24:35,020 --> 00:24:36,020
I'm sorry

393
00:24:37,020 --> 00:24:38,020
I'm sorry

394
00:24:39,020 --> 00:24:40,020
I'm sorry

395
00:24:40,020 --> 00:24:42,020
The Cloud Sword is my life

396
00:24:43,020 --> 00:24:44,020
The rest of the way

397
00:24:46,020 --> 00:24:47,020
I want to go by myself

398
00:24:49,020 --> 00:24:50,020
You go back

399
00:24:50,020 --> 00:24:51,020
Nonsense

400
00:24:53,020 --> 00:24:54,020
How can the Cloud Sword

401
00:24:55,020 --> 00:24:57,020
become a person's thing?

402
00:24:58,020 --> 00:24:59,020
I'm a dead man

403
00:25:01,020 --> 00:25:04,020
I'm not afraid of the water

404
00:25:06,020 --> 00:25:07,020
But you are different

405
00:25:10,020 --> 00:25:12,020
There are so many things in life

406
00:25:14,020 --> 00:25:15,020
I'll take care of them

407
00:25:16,020 --> 00:25:18,020
Mr. Zhuo said so

408
00:25:18,020 --> 00:25:20,020
It's hard to see people outside

409
00:25:22,020 --> 00:25:23,020
Mr. Zhuo

410
00:25:24,020 --> 00:25:26,020
has gone through a lot

411
00:25:27,020 --> 00:25:28,020
Right?

412
00:25:34,020 --> 00:25:35,020
The Cloud Sword

413
00:25:40,020 --> 00:25:41,020
is gone

414
00:25:50,020 --> 00:25:51,020
It's not good to repair it

415
00:25:52,020 --> 00:25:53,020
You are dead

416
00:25:54,020 --> 00:25:55,020
But I'm alive

417
00:25:56,020 --> 00:25:58,020
The whole world is like this

418
00:26:00,020 --> 00:26:01,020
I'm done repair it

419
00:26:02,020 --> 00:26:03,020
I'm dead

420
00:26:04,020 --> 00:26:05,020
You are alive

421
00:26:06,020 --> 00:26:07,020
The whole world is alive

422
00:26:08,020 --> 00:26:09,020
How can I think

423
00:26:10,020 --> 00:26:12,020
that it's better to repair it?

424
00:26:19,020 --> 00:26:20,020
Repair it

425
00:26:22,020 --> 00:26:23,020
You are dead too

426
00:26:29,020 --> 00:26:30,020
Zhao Yuncheng

427
00:26:34,020 --> 00:26:35,020
You promised me this condition

428
00:26:38,020 --> 00:26:39,020
I'll go with you

429
00:26:40,020 --> 00:26:41,020
I'll go with you

430
00:26:53,020 --> 00:26:54,020
I can't promise you this

431
00:26:58,020 --> 00:26:59,020
Because I'm not dead

432
00:27:03,020 --> 00:27:04,020
I actually reject you

433
00:27:08,020 --> 00:27:09,020
I can only promise you

434
00:27:11,020 --> 00:27:13,020
I'm not looking for death by myself

435
00:27:14,020 --> 00:27:15,020
Is that okay?

436
00:27:21,020 --> 00:27:22,020
Yes

437
00:27:27,020 --> 00:27:28,020
Wei Xiao

438
00:27:29,020 --> 00:27:30,020
Pei Siqi

439
00:27:32,020 --> 00:27:33,020
You wait for us here

440
00:27:34,020 --> 00:27:35,020
If you don't wait

441
00:27:36,020 --> 00:27:37,020
You will die

442
00:27:38,020 --> 00:27:39,020
Zhu Yichen

443
00:27:39,020 --> 00:27:40,020
Wei Xiao

444
00:27:40,020 --> 00:27:41,020
Call me aunt

445
00:27:44,020 --> 00:27:45,020
This matter

446
00:27:46,020 --> 00:27:47,020
Can't be discussed

447
00:27:47,020 --> 00:27:49,020
Don't make a comeback

448
00:27:50,020 --> 00:27:51,020
But I...

449
00:27:51,020 --> 00:27:52,020
What do I do?

450
00:27:54,020 --> 00:27:56,020
The blood of the human body is suppressed

451
00:27:57,020 --> 00:27:59,020
It's more scary than the red demon's teeth

452
00:27:59,020 --> 00:28:00,020
Shut up

453
00:28:09,020 --> 00:28:10,020
You are not the first day

454
00:28:10,020 --> 00:28:11,020
to know them

455
00:28:12,020 --> 00:28:14,020
How can you throw them away?

456
00:28:17,020 --> 00:28:18,020
Let's go

457
00:28:18,020 --> 00:28:19,020
Remember to promise me

458
00:28:35,020 --> 00:28:36,020
I promised you

459
00:28:36,020 --> 00:28:37,020
that I will never let you go

460
00:28:38,020 --> 00:28:42,020
I promised you too many things

461
00:28:45,020 --> 00:28:46,020
I'll do it one by one

462
00:28:48,020 --> 00:28:49,020
If I can't finish it

463
00:28:53,020 --> 00:28:54,020
Don't blame me, Mr. Zhu

464
00:29:07,020 --> 00:29:08,020
Who is coming to die?

465
00:29:10,020 --> 00:29:11,020
Who is asking?

466
00:29:12,020 --> 00:29:13,020
Zhu Zui

467
00:29:14,020 --> 00:29:15,020
You can't be like this

468
00:29:15,020 --> 00:29:16,020
Why?

469
00:29:19,020 --> 00:29:20,020
I'm also the ancestor

470
00:29:21,020 --> 00:29:22,020
You are afraid of death

471
00:29:22,020 --> 00:29:23,020
I'm a big demon

472
00:29:23,020 --> 00:29:24,020
What's the point of being like this?

473
00:29:24,020 --> 00:29:25,020
Shut up

474
00:29:26,020 --> 00:29:28,020
Who doesn't care about me?

475
00:29:30,020 --> 00:29:32,020
I'm the one who is the most important

476
00:29:33,020 --> 00:29:35,020
I'm the one who is the most important

477
00:29:36,020 --> 00:29:38,020
But you

478
00:29:39,020 --> 00:29:40,020
Your eyes

479
00:29:41,020 --> 00:29:43,020
look like he really does

480
00:29:44,020 --> 00:29:48,020
Why are you here?

481
00:29:51,020 --> 00:29:52,020
My Cloud Sword is destroyed

482
00:29:53,020 --> 00:29:54,020
I want to come here

483
00:29:54,020 --> 00:29:55,020
to see if there is any repair method

484
00:29:56,020 --> 00:29:57,020
Okay

485
00:29:59,020 --> 00:30:00,020
I didn't expect

486
00:30:01,020 --> 00:30:02,020
that the Cloud Sword

487
00:30:02,020 --> 00:30:04,020
would be destroyed one day

488
00:30:06,020 --> 00:30:08,020
The Cloud Sword is destroyed

489
00:30:09,020 --> 00:30:10,020
by me

490
00:30:11,020 --> 00:30:13,020
and the ancestor is behind it

491
00:30:15,020 --> 00:30:17,020
I'm here to

492
00:30:19,020 --> 00:30:20,020
ask for help

493
00:30:22,020 --> 00:30:23,020
Excuse me

494
00:30:24,020 --> 00:30:25,020
Do you know the method of repair?

495
00:30:26,020 --> 00:30:28,020
Originally, the five colors

496
00:30:28,020 --> 00:30:29,020
can be repaired

497
00:30:30,020 --> 00:30:31,020
But

498
00:30:31,020 --> 00:30:34,020
you destroyed the five colors

499
00:30:36,020 --> 00:30:37,020
Why do you know?

500
00:30:38,020 --> 00:30:39,020
The demon's body

501
00:30:40,020 --> 00:30:41,020
is clear enough

502
00:30:42,020 --> 00:30:43,020
He has absorbed

503
00:30:44,020 --> 00:30:45,020
the blood of the soldier

504
00:30:45,020 --> 00:30:47,020
in the five colors

505
00:30:49,020 --> 00:30:50,020
This kid

506
00:30:51,020 --> 00:30:53,020
will soon become a demon

507
00:30:54,020 --> 00:30:55,020
Do you have any other method?

508
00:30:58,020 --> 00:30:59,020
Yes

509
00:31:02,020 --> 00:31:04,020
Please give me the command

510
00:31:05,020 --> 00:31:07,020
I can give you the command

511
00:31:08,020 --> 00:31:09,020
But I have a condition

512
00:31:13,020 --> 00:31:14,020
Tell me

513
00:31:15,020 --> 00:31:16,020
After the soldier leaves

514
00:31:17,020 --> 00:31:18,020
no one can do it

515
00:31:19,020 --> 00:31:21,020
It's cold here

516
00:31:22,020 --> 00:31:24,020
It's hard to get old

517
00:31:26,020 --> 00:31:28,020
soldier, listen to me

518
00:31:28,020 --> 00:31:29,020
Listen to me

519
00:31:30,020 --> 00:31:31,020
My condition is

520
00:31:32,020 --> 00:31:33,020
you choose to stay alone

521
00:31:33,020 --> 00:31:34,020
and accompany me

522
00:31:35,020 --> 00:31:36,020
I'll tell you

523
00:31:37,020 --> 00:31:39,020
the method of repair the Cloud Sword

524
00:31:41,020 --> 00:31:42,020
Stay and accompany you

525
00:31:43,020 --> 00:31:44,020
What do you mean?

526
00:31:46,020 --> 00:31:47,020
You will use

527
00:31:47,020 --> 00:31:48,020
the frozen water

528
00:31:49,020 --> 00:31:51,020
to use the ice

529
00:31:52,020 --> 00:31:53,020
You will stay here

530
00:31:53,020 --> 00:31:54,020
with the ice

531
00:31:55,020 --> 00:31:56,020
as a soldier

532
00:31:56,020 --> 00:31:58,020
and accompany you forever

533
00:32:00,020 --> 00:32:01,020
I'll tell you

534
00:32:01,020 --> 00:32:03,020
the method of repair

535
00:32:03,020 --> 00:32:04,020
How?

536
00:32:05,020 --> 00:32:06,020
Not exactly

537
00:32:08,020 --> 00:32:09,020
I won't repair

538
00:32:13,020 --> 00:32:14,020
the Cloud Sword

539
00:32:27,020 --> 00:32:29,020
I'll stay here

540
00:32:38,020 --> 00:32:39,020
Stay alone

541
00:32:40,020 --> 00:32:41,020
or stay alone

542
00:32:42,020 --> 00:32:43,020
and accompany me

543
00:32:56,020 --> 00:32:57,020
I'll stay here

544
00:33:17,020 --> 00:33:18,020
Mr. Pei

545
00:33:22,020 --> 00:33:23,020
I haven't found a chance

546
00:33:24,020 --> 00:33:26,020
to say thank you to you

547
00:33:28,020 --> 00:33:29,020
Zhu Yichen

548
00:33:29,020 --> 00:33:30,020
What are you doing?

549
00:33:31,020 --> 00:33:32,020
Thank you

550
00:33:33,020 --> 00:33:34,020
for protecting Wenxiang

551
00:33:36,020 --> 00:33:37,020
and protecting everyone

552
00:33:38,020 --> 00:33:39,020
You don't have to thank me

553
00:33:43,020 --> 00:33:44,020
I protect Wenxiang

554
00:33:46,020 --> 00:33:47,020
not for you

555
00:33:53,020 --> 00:33:54,020
I'll tell you

556
00:33:55,020 --> 00:33:56,020
the method of repair

557
00:33:57,020 --> 00:33:58,020
I'll tell you

558
00:33:59,020 --> 00:34:00,020
the method of repair

559
00:34:01,020 --> 00:34:02,020
How?

560
00:34:03,020 --> 00:34:04,020
I'll tell you

561
00:34:05,020 --> 00:34:06,020
the method of repair

562
00:34:07,020 --> 00:34:08,020
How?

563
00:34:09,020 --> 00:34:10,020
I'll tell you

564
00:34:11,020 --> 00:34:12,020
the method of repair

565
00:34:13,020 --> 00:34:14,020
How?

566
00:34:15,020 --> 00:34:16,020
I'll tell you

567
00:34:17,020 --> 00:34:18,020
the method of repair

568
00:34:19,020 --> 00:34:20,020
How?

569
00:34:21,020 --> 00:34:22,020
How?

570
00:34:36,020 --> 00:34:37,020
I want to tell you

571
00:34:41,020 --> 00:34:42,020
everything is inside

572
00:34:46,020 --> 00:34:47,020
You'll understand when you see it

573
00:34:51,020 --> 00:34:52,020
I'll tell you

574
00:35:08,020 --> 00:35:10,020
Do you remember

575
00:35:11,020 --> 00:35:12,020
what I told you?

576
00:35:12,020 --> 00:35:13,020
Do you remember?

577
00:35:19,020 --> 00:35:20,020
Did you lie to me?

578
00:35:22,020 --> 00:35:23,020
I don't remember

579
00:35:26,020 --> 00:35:27,020
I'm a demon

580
00:35:27,020 --> 00:35:28,020
I'm a man of my heart

581

00:35:40,020 --> 00:35:41,020
Every time you make a fool of yourself

584
00:35:43,020 --> 00:35:44,020
I'll wait for you

585
00:35:47,020 --> 00:35:49,020
You're always a scared person

586
00:35:51,020 --> 00:35:52,020
But I know

587
00:35:55,020 --> 00:35:56,020
you never fear me

588
00:35:59,020 --> 00:36:00,020
You're not afraid of death

589
00:36:05,020 --> 00:36:07,020
You take good care of Wenxiang for me

590
00:36:07,020 --> 00:36:08,020
Wenxiang

591
00:36:12,020 --> 00:36:13,020
He likes to take risks

592
00:36:15,020 --> 00:36:16,020
and break through

593
00:36:17,020 --> 00:36:18,020
He's always in the way

594
00:36:24,020 --> 00:36:26,020
But he won't listen to me

595
00:36:32,020 --> 00:36:33,020
He'll

596
00:36:37,020 --> 00:36:38,020
never

597
00:36:49,020 --> 00:36:50,020

Zhu

608
00:38:30,020 --> 00:38:32,020

609
00:38:33,020 --> 00:38:35,020
he found a new master in the world

610

He found him

611
00:38:41,020 --> 00:38:43,020
Then he asked him to return to Xiao Qiao

612
00:38:46,020 --> 00:38:47,020
Then

613
00:38:49,020 --> 00:38:51,020
