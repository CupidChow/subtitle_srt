[Episode 2]

3
00:01:50,630 --> 00:01:51,490
Archivist Wen,

4
00:01:51,630 --> 00:01:53,430
how come you're bleeding again?

5
00:02:05,990 --> 00:02:07,100
I need to go out.

6
00:02:24,270 --> 00:02:27,000
I waited for you so long that I almost fell asleep.

7
00:02:27,110 --> 00:02:28,310
You knew I would come?

8
00:02:29,990 --> 00:02:31,980
I know you can't let it go.

9
00:02:32,430 --> 00:02:34,000
I can't let go of your life.

10
00:02:35,030 --> 00:02:37,890
You have the blood of countless lives on your hands.

11
00:02:38,150 --> 00:02:39,710
Even your death is not enough.

12
00:02:39,710 --> 00:02:41,579
So you were bound to come.

13
00:02:42,670 --> 00:02:46,270
Because you want to know the true way to use the Cloud Light Sword.

14
00:02:47,850 --> 00:02:49,250
I can tell you.

15
00:02:50,190 --> 00:02:51,590
But you have conditions.

16
00:02:52,950 --> 00:02:53,750
Yes.

17
00:02:55,870 --> 00:02:57,140
What do you want?

18
00:02:57,829 --> 00:02:59,829
I want a vow from you.

19
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:02,430
Make a solemn vow.

20
00:03:03,270 --> 00:03:04,870
Never to go back on your word.

21
00:03:06,430 --> 00:03:07,440
What do you want me

22
00:03:07,910 --> 00:03:08,910
to do?

23
00:03:15,270 --> 00:03:17,030
I want you to kill me.

24
00:03:17,810 --> 00:03:20,870
I'll teach you the true way to use the Cloud Light Sword.

25
00:03:21,180 --> 00:03:22,280
Then...

26
00:03:24,390 --> 00:03:25,710
Kill me.

27
00:03:32,630 --> 00:03:33,890
You really want to die?

28
00:03:35,230 --> 00:03:36,070
Yes.

29
00:03:37,470 --> 00:03:39,740
And I must die by your hand.

30
00:03:41,990 --> 00:03:43,350
I don't understand.

31
00:03:43,990 --> 00:03:45,190
If you want to die,

32
00:03:46,070 --> 00:03:47,670
there are thousands of ways.

33
00:03:48,820 --> 00:03:50,780
Why must I be the one to kill you?

34
00:03:52,950 --> 00:03:55,260
People call me an extremely evil demon.

35
00:03:55,390 --> 00:03:56,940
Why do you think that is?

36
00:03:57,370 --> 00:03:59,190
It's obviously because you've committed numerous evil deeds.

37
00:03:59,190 --> 00:04:00,650
You're extremely brutal.

38
00:04:01,710 --> 00:04:04,440
Mr. Zhuo, don't believe those rumors.

39
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:05,760
What?

40
00:04:06,510 --> 00:04:08,910
Don't tell me you're actually a good demon?

41
00:04:10,830 --> 00:04:11,630
No.

42
00:04:13,430 --> 00:04:15,270
I'm more vicious and eviler

43
00:04:15,940 --> 00:04:16,870
than rumors say.

44
00:04:17,750 --> 00:04:20,350
Not only do I absorb the world's malicious energy,

45
00:04:20,350 --> 00:04:22,910
but I'm also a vessel that contains it.

46
00:04:25,870 --> 00:04:27,410
Do you know what malicious energy is?

47
00:04:27,410 --> 00:04:28,600
Of course I do.

48
00:04:30,230 --> 00:04:32,030
It can destroy heaven and earth.

49
00:04:32,510 --> 00:04:33,770
It can make the world

50
00:04:33,790 --> 00:04:34,790
dark and sunless,

51
00:04:36,030 --> 00:04:37,690
and be littered with corpses.

52
00:04:38,030 --> 00:04:38,870
So,

53
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:40,510
when I die,

54
00:04:41,350 --> 00:04:42,430
a new vessel

55
00:04:42,430 --> 00:04:45,300
will immediately be born in the world

56
00:04:45,909 --> 00:04:47,030
to replace me

57
00:04:47,030 --> 00:04:50,030
and contain and absorb the endless malicious energy.

58
00:04:52,390 --> 00:04:54,070
And whether the new vessel

59
00:04:54,510 --> 00:04:56,320
is good or evil

60
00:04:56,620 --> 00:04:58,260
righteous or wicked,

61
00:04:58,830 --> 00:05:00,270
can't be predicted.

62
00:05:04,150 --> 00:05:05,520
Your Cloud Light Sword

63
00:05:05,950 --> 00:05:08,860
can dispel all evil spirits and demons.

64
00:05:09,730 --> 00:05:11,670
Dying by your sword

65
00:05:12,660 --> 00:05:15,750
can end the vessels' reincarnation cycle.

66
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:25,320
I, Zhuo Yichen,

67
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:27,960
swear to the heavens

68
00:05:30,170 --> 00:05:31,600
that as long as Zhu Yan

69
00:05:31,630 --> 00:05:34,780
teaches me the true way to use the Cloud Light Sword,

70
00:05:35,610 --> 00:05:38,340
I will surely slay him with my sword.

71
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:41,280
If I break this vow,

72
00:05:42,700 --> 00:05:44,500
may heaven and earth destroy me,

73
00:05:45,230 --> 00:05:46,630
and my soul be scattered.

74
00:05:50,630 --> 00:05:51,790
Very good.

75
00:06:05,170 --> 00:06:06,420
What's going on?

76
00:06:06,980 --> 00:06:08,240
What happened?

77
00:06:09,870 --> 00:06:10,460
Well...

78
00:06:10,490 --> 00:06:12,310
I don't know what happened either.

79
00:06:12,310 --> 00:06:13,670
When Commander Zhuo came just now,

80
00:06:13,670 --> 00:06:14,870
he was fine.

81
00:06:15,110 --> 00:06:16,350
Commander Zhuo was here?

82
00:06:16,350 --> 00:06:17,160
He just left.

83
00:06:20,870 --> 00:06:21,690
Open the door.

84
00:06:21,810 --> 00:06:22,470
Yes.

85
00:06:23,910 --> 00:06:25,010

87
00:06:25,110 --> 00:06:26,310
we need to select

88
00:06:26,310 --> 00:06:28,110
an elite force to lead the charge

89
00:06:28,110 --> 00:06:31,100
to quickly solve the Water Ghost's wedding murder case.

90
00:06:31,100 --> 00:06:33,710
This is the list of candidates drafted by the Prime Minister.

91
00:06:33,710 --> 00:06:35,270
Each of them possesses extraordinary skills

92
00:06:35,270 --> 00:06:36,350
and they are unwaveringly loyal.

93
00:06:36,350 --> 00:06:37,620
There are twenty-eight people in total.

94
00:06:37,620 --> 00:06:39,130
Five will suffice.

95
00:06:39,190 --> 00:06:39,990
Quantity over quality

96
00:06:39,990 --> 00:06:41,050
is useless.

97
00:06:41,670 --> 00:06:43,510
I have prepared five tokens.

98
00:06:44,110 --> 00:06:46,430
Two of them have already been handed to them.

99

[Demon Hunting Bureau]

100
00:06:50,710 --> 00:06:51,700
These two

101
00:06:51,700 --> 00:06:54,240
are not on the Prime Minister's list.

102
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:46,210
Get up.

103
00:07:46,710 --> 00:07:47,720
Stop pretending.

104
00:07:55,070 --> 00:07:57,930
I didn't expect Ms. Wen Xiao to care so much about me.

105
00:07:58,230 --> 00:08:00,080
I can't help but feel touched.

106
00:08:03,180 --> 00:08:05,640
I'm already up and you're still stabbing me?

107
00:08:07,190 --> 00:08:08,340
Just in case.

108
00:08:08,420 --> 00:08:10,150
I'll give you a small cut first.

109
00:08:10,470 --> 00:08:12,100
There's Huanling Powder on the blade.

110
00:08:12,100 --> 00:08:14,160
It can suppress your demonic powers.

111
00:08:14,630 --> 00:08:15,580
Otherwise,

112
00:08:15,710 --> 00:08:17,310
I'm afraid you might hurt me.

113
00:08:17,710 --> 00:08:20,050
You're the one who's been hurting me.

114
00:08:21,390 --> 00:08:22,950
Humans and demons should keep their distance.

115
00:08:22,950 --> 00:08:24,350
Why are you here to see me?

116
00:08:24,630 --> 00:08:25,560
I'm here

117
00:08:25,630 --> 00:08:26,790
to give you a gift.

118
00:08:30,390 --> 00:08:32,990
It seems Mr. Fan Ying has accepted my proposal.

119
00:08:34,190 --> 00:08:35,880
It'll be impolite not to reciprocate.

120
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:37,700
I'm a very polite person.

121
00:08:37,990 --> 00:08:38,809
Tell me,

122
00:08:39,190 --> 00:08:40,350
what do you want?

123
00:08:41,030 --> 00:08:42,190
I want an answer.

124
00:08:43,429 --> 00:08:44,600
What did

125
00:08:44,950 --> 00:08:46,550
Zhuo come to see you for?

126
00:08:55,390 --> 00:08:57,200
Why do you care so much about him?

127
00:08:58,030 --> 00:09:00,870
He's just an ordinary mortal man.

128
00:09:03,630 --> 00:09:04,470
Zhuo

129
00:09:04,470 --> 00:09:06,280
is no ordinary man.

130
00:09:06,590 --> 00:09:07,810
Zhuo?

131
00:09:08,190 --> 00:09:09,350
Zhuo.

132
00:09:18,870 --> 00:09:19,830
What's going on?

133
00:09:20,190 --> 00:09:21,850
Are you going to tell me or not?

134
00:09:22,910 --> 00:09:25,470
This is an agreement between Commander Zhuo and me.

135
00:09:25,470 --> 00:09:26,620
It's a secret.

136
00:09:27,110 --> 00:09:29,000
How can I easily tell others?

137
00:09:29,590 --> 00:09:30,550
Others?

138
00:09:31,190 --> 00:09:32,600
Mr. Zhao Yuanzhou,

139
00:09:32,670 --> 00:09:34,110
you specifically named me

140
00:09:34,110 --> 00:09:35,600
to hunt demons together.

141
00:09:35,940 --> 00:09:37,700
Now you call me

142
00:09:37,830 --> 00:09:38,780
"others"?

143
00:09:40,070 --> 00:09:40,870
That's right.

144
00:09:41,370 --> 00:09:43,100
You're not happy about

145
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:45,170
hunting demons with me?

146
00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:46,470
Nope.

147
00:09:47,710 --> 00:09:48,990
Mortal women

148
00:09:48,990 --> 00:09:50,790
all say one thing and mean another.

149
00:09:50,790 --> 00:09:53,260
You seem to know a lot about mortal women.

150
00:09:53,310 --> 00:09:55,040
I know a thing or two, I suppose.

151
00:09:55,270 --> 00:09:57,670
Don't you also carry a pen and notebook every day

152
00:09:57,670 --> 00:09:59,550
to study us demons of the Wilderness?

153
00:09:59,550 --> 00:10:00,350
You and I,

154
00:10:00,610 --> 00:10:02,210
we're not so different.

155
00:10:02,920 --> 00:10:05,580
How much have you been snooping around about me?

156
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:10,320
If I hadn't specifically requested it,

157
00:10:10,790 --> 00:10:12,990
I'm afraid with your weak and frail body

158
00:10:13,030 --> 00:10:15,030
that could be blown over by the wind,

159
00:10:15,110 --> 00:10:18,110
you'd never make it into the Demon Hunting Squad in your lifetime.

160
00:10:18,110 --> 00:10:20,150
When did I ever say I wanted to join?

161
00:10:20,150 --> 00:10:20,910
See?

162
00:10:21,350 --> 00:10:22,110
See?

163
00:10:22,550 --> 00:10:24,720
The storybooks were right after all.

164
00:10:24,870 --> 00:10:25,770
Women

165
00:10:25,910 --> 00:10:28,040
always say one thing and mean another.

166
00:10:28,550 --> 00:10:29,550
Before I came here,

167
00:10:29,550 --> 00:10:31,410
I had already inquired about you.

168
00:10:31,670 --> 00:10:34,400
Ms. Wen Xiao is dedicated to helping demons,

169
00:10:34,660 --> 00:10:36,770
secretly releasing demons many times

170
00:10:36,770 --> 00:10:38,980
from under the nose of Chongwu Camp.

171
00:10:39,390 --> 00:10:40,460
You always say

172
00:10:40,460 --> 00:10:42,090
people can be good or bad,

173
00:10:42,310 --> 00:10:44,230

Because the Baize Token is missing.

You don't need to tell me.

208

that if you can't find it back,

It seems your master didn't tell you that.

What do you want the Baize Token for?

228
00:14:01,380 --> 00:14:03,510
Because the goddess hasn't returned.

00:20:41,780 --> 00:20:43,040
to take care of me.

347
00:21:13,030 --> 00:21:14,300
If it's him,

348
00:21:14,980 --> 00:21:17,130
he might really know the whereabouts of the Baize Token.

349
00:21:17,130 --> 00:21:18,170
Impossible.

350
00:21:18,430 --> 00:21:21,750
Zhu Yan killed so many people from the Demon Hunting Bureau back then.

351
00:21:21,750 --> 00:21:23,610
Your master is the Baize Goddess.

352
00:21:24,780 --> 00:21:27,580
How could she possibly be old friends with Zhu Yan?

353
00:21:29,670 --> 00:21:30,830
You're so young.

354
00:21:31,190 --> 00:21:33,920
Don't always have such a precocious expression.

355
00:21:33,950 --> 00:21:35,670
I'll be 24 next month.

356
00:21:35,670 --> 00:21:37,810
Even if you were 42, I'd still be your aunt.

357
00:21:37,810 --> 00:21:38,470
I...

358
00:21:53,880 --> 00:21:55,130
I know.

359
00:21:56,440 --> 00:21:58,900
You can't get over that hurdle in your heart.

360
00:21:59,670 --> 00:22:02,260
He's the one who killed your father and brother,

361
00:22:02,260 --> 00:22:04,490
yet you have to fight alongside him

362
00:22:04,830 --> 00:22:06,630
and interact with him every day.

363
00:22:06,990 --> 00:22:09,580
I'm letting down the spirits of my father and brother.

364
00:22:09,580 --> 00:22:11,840
But to protect the Demon Hunting Bureau,

365
00:22:12,520 --> 00:22:14,600
you still agreed, didn't you?

366
00:22:15,850 --> 00:22:17,730
This is your ancestral home,

367
00:22:18,380 --> 00:22:20,320
the home you grew up in.

368
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:22,670
You were willing to donate it

369
00:22:22,670 --> 00:22:24,490
to rebuild the Demon Hunting Bureau.

370
00:22:24,490 --> 00:22:25,470
Can't you just...

371
00:22:25,470 --> 00:22:27,330
After my father and brother died,

372
00:22:27,790 --> 00:22:30,520
this place became just an empty, desolate house.

373
00:22:33,710 --> 00:22:34,800
Not a home.

374
00:22:35,910 --> 00:22:38,380
I lived here alone in a daze,

375
00:22:39,150 --> 00:22:40,370
wasting my time.

376
00:22:43,780 --> 00:22:44,900
Eight years ago,

377
00:22:46,100 --> 00:22:47,640
I already lost my home.

378
00:22:51,900 --> 00:22:54,480
Now that the people from the Demon Hunting Bureau are here,

379
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:55,890
there's more life here.

380
00:22:56,430 --> 00:22:58,360
It's actually better than before.

381
00:23:00,070 --> 00:23:01,310
For generations, the Zhuo family

382
00:23:01,310 --> 00:23:04,070
has been full of people with a sense of righteousness.

383
00:23:04,070 --> 00:23:05,230
Temporarily working with your enemy

384
00:23:05,230 --> 00:23:06,630
for the sake of investigating the case,

385
00:23:06,630 --> 00:23:08,480
for the Baize Token,

386
00:23:08,790 --> 00:23:10,650
they will surely understand you.

387
00:23:11,390 --> 00:23:12,590
They won't blame you.

388
00:23:14,950 --> 00:23:16,270
Actually, I agreed to him

389
00:23:16,270 --> 00:23:18,730
joining the Demon Hunting Squad because...

390
00:23:21,030 --> 00:23:21,750
What?

391
00:23:27,270 --> 00:23:28,110
Mr. Fan.

392
00:23:28,590 --> 00:23:29,430
Zhuo,

393
00:23:30,020 --> 00:23:32,090
do you know that your ancestor, Bingyi,

394
00:23:32,090 --> 00:23:34,370
once destroyed the evil demon Yinglong?

395
00:23:34,630 --> 00:23:35,420
Yes, I know.

396
00:23:35,560 --> 00:23:38,190
Yinglong had the divine power to glimpse the future.

397
00:23:38,190 --> 00:23:39,390
He once predicted

398
00:23:39,480 --> 00:23:42,270
that every successor of Bingyi who inherited the Cloud Light Sword

399
00:23:42,270 --> 00:23:44,940
would slay the evilest demon of their time.

400
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:46,720
Yinglong's prophecy

401
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:48,070
seems to be wrong.

402
00:23:49,510 --> 00:23:50,590
I can't kill him.

403
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:51,690
No.

404
00:23:51,870 --> 00:23:54,470
Yinglong's prophecies have never been wrong.

405
00:23:54,830 --> 00:23:56,430
Because it's not a prophecy.

406
00:23:56,990 --> 00:23:58,190
It's a curse.

407
00:24:01,810 --> 00:24:02,910
Slaying Zhu Yan

408
00:24:02,910 --> 00:24:04,420
is my mission.

409
00:24:05,470 --> 00:24:07,400
If this is also considered a curse,

410
00:24:09,310 --> 00:24:10,910
then I couldn't ask for more.

411
00:24:16,810 --> 00:24:17,890
It's nothing.

412
00:24:19,750 --> 00:24:20,550
Oh, right.

413
00:24:20,950 --> 00:24:24,010
Why did you go to the dungeon alone to see Zhao Yuanzhou?

414
00:24:28,850 --> 00:24:30,710
You and Zhao Yuanzhou...

415
00:24:32,510 --> 00:24:33,970
There's something wrong.

416
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:37,070
We have a secret.

417
00:24:37,190 --> 00:24:37,950
You

418
00:24:38,210 --> 00:24:40,070
are the one with something wrong.

419
00:25:02,300 --> 00:25:03,070
Hey.

420
00:25:03,990 --> 00:25:05,120
What a coincidence.

421
00:25:08,990 --> 00:25:10,320
You're indeed a monkey.

422
00:25:17,190 --> 00:25:20,040
Although your Demon Hunting Bureau looks poor,

423
00:25:21,470 --> 00:25:22,940
it's quite spacious.

424
00:25:23,050 --> 00:25:24,350
You can work in the front

425
00:25:24,350 --> 00:25:25,550
and live in the back.

How did he get released?

429
00:25:32,680 --> 00:25:34,740
Wasn't a Demon Hunting Squad formed?

430
00:25:36,330 --> 00:25:38,260
I was afraid you'd leave me behind,

431
00:25:38,600 --> 00:25:39,930
so I followed you.

432
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:41,940
You actually followed me?

433
00:25:42,630 --> 00:25:43,810
Shameless.

434
00:25:44,190 --> 00:25:46,320
Isn't Mr. Zhuo eager to solve the case?

435
00:25:46,670 --> 00:25:48,330
I'm helping everyone save time.

436

We're still missing two.

As it happens, they are

440
00:25:56,830 --> 00:25:59,560
the two types of people I'm worst at dealing with.

441
00:26:00,410 --> 00:26:01,340
Which two types?

442
00:26:03,020 --> 00:26:03,990
One is a woman.

443
00:26:04,890 --> 00:26:06,130
The other is a child.

He probably can't even reach my knee, right?

Is he capable?

You were ordered to eliminate the demon.

That's right.

518
00:31:01,420 --> 00:31:04,150
That's why I resigned from my official position.

519
00:31:04,710 --> 00:31:07,970
It was to avoid getting involved in demonic affairs again.

520
00:31:10,100 --> 00:31:12,680
Don't you want to clear up your confusion?

521
00:31:14,500 --> 00:31:15,950
I've investigated

522
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:18,440
but found nothing.

523
00:31:20,290 --> 00:31:21,320
We all

524
00:31:22,830 --> 00:31:24,170
can help you.

525
00:31:28,030 --> 00:31:29,240
You all?

526
00:31:39,140 --> 00:31:39,930
Break.

527
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:15,350
Us.

528
00:32:16,710 --> 00:32:17,870
But mainly me.

529
00:32:20,230 --> 00:32:20,830
She

530
00:32:21,970 --> 00:32:23,190
can't be relied upon.

531
00:32:25,580 --> 00:32:27,180
If I couldn't find anything,

532
00:32:27,980 --> 00:32:29,580
what makes you think you can?

533
00:32:38,110 --> 00:32:39,670
Isn't it obvious enough?

534
00:32:40,690 --> 00:32:42,110
I'm a demon.

535
00:32:42,710 --> 00:32:44,440
Things that humans don't know,

536
00:32:45,910 --> 00:32:47,100
I know.

537
00:32:48,390 --> 00:32:50,050
About your brother's matter,

538
00:32:50,830 --> 00:32:52,140
I know that too.

539

[Demon Hunting Bureau]

540
00:33:03,550 --> 00:33:04,750
Since we're here...

541
00:33:05,410 --> 00:33:07,490
[Demon Hunting Bureau]

542
00:33:08,830 --> 00:33:10,390
It's the Spring Festival.

543
00:33:25,570 --> 00:33:30,330
[Demon Hunting Bureau]

544
00:33:40,680 --> 00:33:41,670
Open.

545
00:33:54,170 --> 00:33:56,170
So this is the Demon Hunting Bureau?

546
00:34:05,060 --> 00:34:06,710
I wonder if I'll see him

547
00:34:07,310 --> 00:34:08,800
after I go in.

548
00:34:09,070 --> 00:34:09,920
Kid,

549
00:34:10,030 --> 00:34:11,639
who do you want to see?

550
00:34:13,060 --> 00:34:14,300
Why is it you again?

551
00:34:14,790 --> 00:34:15,630
How come

552
00:34:15,630 --> 00:34:17,560
you walk without making any sound?

553
00:34:18,070 --> 00:34:19,520
Stop dawdling.

554
00:34:19,710 --> 00:34:20,770
Just go in already.

555
00:34:21,500 --> 00:34:22,760
You don't understand.

556
00:34:24,710 --> 00:34:25,980
Haven't you heard?

557
00:34:26,400 --> 00:34:27,989
Inside the Demon Hunting Bureau, there's

558
00:34:27,989 --> 00:34:29,520
a thousand-year-old demon

559
00:34:29,590 --> 00:34:30,710
with a green face and fangs.

560
00:34:30,710 --> 00:34:31,860
It's ugly,

561
00:34:31,860 --> 00:34:32,980
and it even eats people.

562
00:34:32,980 --> 00:34:33,889
Nonsense!

563
00:34:35,750 --> 00:34:37,409
How could it possibly be ugly?

564
00:34:37,429 --> 00:34:38,520
It's true!

565
00:34:38,750 --> 00:34:40,550
I saw it with my own eyes.

566
00:34:40,980 --> 00:34:41,500
At that time,

567
00:34:41,500 --> 00:34:44,270
many experts from the Demon Hunting Bureau fell to the ground,

568
00:34:44,270 --> 00:34:45,639
leaving only me.

569
00:34:45,820 --> 00:34:47,170
I was terrified then,

570
00:34:47,199 --> 00:34:48,679
but I still bravely went up

571
00:34:48,710 --> 00:34:50,840
and fought fiercely with that Zhu Yan.

572
00:34:51,070 --> 00:34:52,400
In the end, I can only say

573
00:34:52,750 --> 00:34:54,080
it was a narrow victory.

574
00:34:55,030 --> 00:34:56,909
Otherwise, why do you think the Demon Hunting Bureau would choose me

575
00:34:56,909 --> 00:34:59,110
to join the first elite squad?

576
00:34:59,750 --> 00:35:00,710
Bai Jiu.

577
00:35:01,870 --> 00:35:02,780
Hello.

578
00:35:09,550 --> 00:35:10,740
Don't look down on me because of my short stature.

579
00:35:10,740 --> 00:35:12,670
That's because I'm only 13 years old.

580
00:35:12,670 --> 00:35:14,790
Don't underestimate me because of my young age.

581
00:35:14,790 --> 00:35:15,790
I'm very capable.

582
00:35:17,590 --> 00:35:19,420
Since Commander Zhuo chose you,

583
00:35:19,670 --> 00:35:20,750
it means

584
00:35:20,840 --> 00:35:22,790
you must have some exceptional qualities.

585
00:35:22,790 --> 00:35:24,400
Mr. Zhuo chose me?

586
00:35:26,190 --> 00:35:28,030
The hero I admire chose me.

587
00:35:28,390 --> 00:35:28,990
Let's go.

588
00:35:29,220 --> 00:35:31,080
I'll take you to meet Mr. Zhuo.

589
00:35:32,990 --> 00:35:34,590
Thank you.

590
00:35:34,830 --> 00:35:36,390
You're so kind.

591
00:35:38,070 --> 00:35:39,630
What's wrong with you, Great Demon?

592
00:35:39,630 --> 00:35:40,690
Why are you so late?

593
00:35:41,430 --> 00:35:42,230
Great Demon?

594
00:35:43,070 --> 00:35:43,910
Where?

595
00:35:45,310 --> 00:35:45,870
Him.

596
00:35:46,390 --> 00:35:47,120
Great Demon.

597
00:35:47,470 --> 00:35:48,310
Zhu Yan.

598
00:35:49,030 --> 00:35:50,890
So you're the Great Demon Zhu Yan?

599
00:36:19,400 --> 00:36:20,470
Let me go.

600
00:36:22,560 --> 00:36:24,100
Put me down!

601
00:36:33,390 --> 00:36:35,080
You don't need to be so afraid.

602
00:36:35,150 --> 00:36:36,270
Zhao Yuanzhou

603
00:36:36,270 --> 00:36:37,470
is just unserious.

604
00:36:37,470 --> 00:36:38,870
He likes to scare people.

605
00:36:39,390 --> 00:36:40,930
He doesn't eat children.

606
00:36:41,870 --> 00:36:43,030
Isn't he that

607
00:36:43,050 --> 00:36:44,690
extremely hungry demon?

608
00:36:44,790 --> 00:36:45,630
If he's so hungry,

609
00:36:45,630 --> 00:36:47,430
how can he resist eating people?

610
00:36:56,620 --> 00:36:58,570
He must be Mr. Zhuo Yichen.

611
00:36:58,770 --> 00:37:00,000
The thing in his hand

612
00:37:00,030 --> 00:37:01,190
is the legendary

613
00:37:01,190 --> 00:37:03,250
Cloud Light Sword of the Bingyi Clan.

614
00:37:07,620 --> 00:37:09,910
Aren't all demons afraid of this sword?

615
00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:12,610
Even Great Demons must fear it, right?

616
00:37:19,730 --> 00:37:20,530
Hello.

617
00:37:23,350 --> 00:37:24,070
Hello.

618
00:37:33,710 --> 00:37:34,310
Ms. Pei,

you're here.

620
00:37:35,830 --> 00:37:37,020
Let me introduce you.

621
00:37:37,020 --> 00:37:38,350
This is the new doctor,

622
00:37:38,370 --> 00:37:38,970
Bai Jiu.

623
00:37:42,030 --> 00:37:42,980
Hello, Sister.

624
00:37:43,050 --> 00:37:45,250
From now on, please take good care of me.

625

I don't believe the words of an

extremely evil demon.

641
00:38:31,530 --> 00:38:33,270
It's right not to believe him.

642
00:38:34,020 --> 00:38:36,140
People from the Demon Hunting Bureau,

00:38:36,140 --> 00:38:36,910

♫Heartlessness births a dream♫

649
00:39:06,470 --> 00:39:08,740
Mr. Zhuo, you're so imposing and powerful now.

650
00:39:08,740 --> 00:39:11,570
You must've forgotten the pain of the wood that has healed.

651
00:39:11,570 --> 00:39:14,790
Back then, the Demon Hunting Bureau was destroyed by Zhu Yan.

652
00:39:14,790 --> 00:39:16,660
It was the Chongwu Camp that took on the dangerous mission

653
00:39:16,660 --> 00:39:18,120
and protected the people.

654
00:39:19,290 --> 00:39:19,980
What?

655
00:39:20,930 --> 00:39:22,010
You forgot?

656
00:39:23,060 --> 00:39:25,660
The Chongwu Camp is ruthless and vicious

657
00:39:25,710 --> 00:39:26,950
in demon hunting.

658
00:39:26,970 --> 00:39:28,680
You even harm innocent lives.

659
00:39:28,710 --> 00:39:29,990
It goes against the law.

660
00:39:29,990 --> 00:39:33,170
The Chongwu Camp should have been stopped from acting arbitrarily long ago.

661
00:39:33,170 --> 00:39:34,960
Demons are inherently violent.

662
00:39:34,960 --> 00:39:36,310
To eliminate future troubles,

663
00:39:36,310 --> 00:39:38,870
it's better to kill a wrong one than to let one go.

664
00:39:38,870 --> 00:39:41,480
The Chongwu Camp privately built an underground black market,

665
00:39:41,480 --> 00:39:43,320
trading demon beast furs and bones,

666
00:39:43,320 --> 00:39:44,920
making exorbitant profits.

667
00:39:45,400 --> 00:39:47,200
And in the name of demon hunting,

668
00:39:47,750 --> 00:39:48,870
you forcibly recruit able-bodied men

669
00:39:48,870 --> 00:39:50,400
and occupy civilian homes.

670
00:39:50,570 --> 00:39:52,890
Does King Xiang know about all of this?

671
00:40:05,090 --> 00:40:06,470
Mr. Zhen Mei,

672
00:40:06,910 --> 00:40:08,150
we're in broad daylight

673
00:40:08,150 --> 00:40:09,560
and in full view of everyone.

674
00:40:09,560 --> 00:40:11,680
You're not planning to commit murder and arson, are you?

675
00:40:11,680 --> 00:40:14,430
The Demon Hunting Bureau has fallen into disrepair.

676
00:40:14,430 --> 00:40:15,870
The weather is hot and dry,

677
00:40:15,870 --> 00:40:17,360
which caused a wildfire.

678
00:40:18,150 --> 00:40:19,950
What does that have to do with me?

679
00:40:36,430 --> 00:40:38,060
Have you asked my permission

680
00:40:38,190 --> 00:40:40,790
before burning down the Demon Hunting Bureau?

681
00:40:41,450 --> 00:40:42,970
What do you think you are?

682
00:40:44,060 --> 00:40:44,900
A demon.

683
00:40:45,110 --> 00:40:45,860
A demon?

684
00:40:47,390 --> 00:40:49,250
Then you deserve to die even more.

685
00:40:52,720 --> 00:40:53,480
Reverse.

686
00:40:56,490 --> 00:40:57,730
I forgot to tell you,

687
00:40:58,550 --> 00:40:59,910
I'm the type of demon

688
00:40:59,910 --> 00:41:02,510
that likes to kill people to vent my anger.

689
00:41:04,780 --> 00:41:05,980
Zhao Yuanzhou,

690
00:41:06,100 --> 00:41:07,550
calm down.

691
00:41:08,940 --> 00:41:10,100
Mr. Fan.

692
00:41:12,420 --> 00:41:13,920
Spare them.

693
00:41:14,250 --> 00:41:15,230
General Wu,

694
00:41:15,830 --> 00:41:17,030
what brings you here?

695
00:41:17,800 --> 00:41:20,330
Mr. Fan said he prepared a gift for King Xiang.

696
00:41:20,450 --> 00:41:22,450
I came personally to receive it

697
00:41:22,520 --> 00:41:24,210
on behalf of King Xiang.

698
00:41:28,670 --> 00:41:30,050
Over the past eight years,

699
00:41:30,050 --> 00:41:32,320
close to 700 innocent people have been killed by the Chongwu Camp

700
00:41:32,320 --> 00:41:33,580
while hunting demons.

701
00:41:33,720 --> 00:41:36,430
The list and related evidence are all here.

702
00:41:37,010 --> 00:41:38,730
Please review them, General.

703
00:41:53,680 --> 00:41:55,320
I accept this

704
00:41:56,590 --> 00:41:58,520
grand gift on behalf of King Xiang.

705
00:41:58,960 --> 00:42:00,110
He now understands

706
00:42:00,110 --> 00:42:02,830
the Demon Hunting Bureau's determination to revitalize itself.

707
00:42:02,830 --> 00:42:04,880
He agrees for you to take over from the Chongwu Camp

708
00:42:04,880 --> 00:42:08,080
and thoroughly investigate the Water Ghost murder case.

709
00:42:08,430 --> 00:42:10,770
The Demon Hunting Bureau hereby requests permission from King Xiang

710
00:42:10,770 --> 00:42:12,370
to thoroughly investigate the Water Ghost murder case.

711
00:42:12,370 --> 00:42:13,980
Do not harm civilians.

712
00:42:14,010 --> 00:42:15,500
Do not be negligent or lazy.

713
00:42:15,500 --> 00:42:17,670
The Demon Hunting Bureau should spare no effort

714
00:42:17,670 --> 00:42:19,310
to solve this case.

715
00:42:19,470 --> 00:42:20,790
I'll trouble you all

716
00:42:20,790 --> 00:42:22,050
to sign and stamp this,

717
00:42:22,300 --> 00:42:23,730
so I can take it back

718
00:42:23,750 --> 00:42:25,410
and report back to King Xiang.

719
00:42:31,500 --> 00:42:34,850

720
00:42:41,650 --> 00:42:42,460
Sir,

721
00:42:42,810 --> 00:42:45,140
you can press down at the end of the scroll.

722
00:43:02,350 --> 00:43:03,630
Mr. Zhuo,

723
00:43:03,650 --> 00:43:05,650
there are people behind you, right?

724
00:43:13,860 --> 00:43:15,260
There's one more person.

725
00:43:17,940 --> 00:43:19,210
She won't need to.

726
00:43:19,420 --> 00:43:21,200
I just heard her say

727
00:43:21,330 --> 00:43:23,860
she refuses to join the Demon Hunting Bureau.

728
00:43:24,170 --> 00:43:26,570
The Demon Hunting Bureau is truly useless.

729
00:43:26,770 --> 00:43:29,050
Even the dogs that our Chongwu Camp doesn't want

730
00:43:29,050 --> 00:43:31,180
look down on the Demon Hunting Bureau.

731
00:43:51,020 --> 00:43:52,200
[Military Order]

732
00:43:53,680 --> 00:43:55,880
Did you hear any dogs barking?

733
00:43:56,790 --> 00:43:57,870
It's a bit noisy.

734
00:44:08,140 --> 00:44:09,400
They're finally gone.

735
00:44:09,950 --> 00:44:11,140
Indeed.

736
00:44:12,770 --> 00:44:15,540
It's a pity the evidence of Chongwu Camp's crimes was burned.

737
00:44:15,540 --> 00:44:16,810
The real evidence

738
00:44:17,070 --> 00:44:18,410
was secretly sent

739
00:44:18,580 --> 00:44:20,640
to the Prime Minister the day before.

740
00:44:20,800 --> 00:44:22,790
If one day they really need to be held accountable,

741
00:44:22,790 --> 00:44:25,190
the Prime Minister will make the decision.

742
00:44:25,500 --> 00:44:26,680
The chance to investigate

743
00:44:26,680 --> 00:44:28,810
the Water Ghost case didn't come easy.

744
00:44:29,400 --> 00:44:31,160
Whether the Demon Hunting Bureau can be revitalized

745
00:44:31,160 --> 00:44:32,960
depends on this crucial battle.

746
00:44:34,720 --> 00:44:35,610
Zhao Yuanzhou,

747
00:44:35,640 --> 00:44:37,500
you'd better not play any tricks.

748
00:44:37,710 --> 00:44:38,700
Mr. Zhuo,

749
00:44:39,680 --> 00:44:40,760
trust me.

750
00:44:41,350 --> 00:44:42,550
Dream on.

751
00:45:15,110 --> 00:45:17,710
These are all the files on the Water Ghost case.

752
00:45:18,230 --> 00:45:20,230
Everyone, please take a look first.

761
00:46:05,630 --> 00:46:06,670
This is blood.

762
00:46:07,890 --> 00:46:09,220
The blood of the demon Meng Ji.
