1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,280
We are both confused

2
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:06,440
We can't only argue

3
00:00:06,940 --> 00:00:09,780
We do understand what is going on

4
00:00:10,680 --> 00:00:15,780
Let's look at that

5
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:21,640
So first we need to defeat her

6
00:00:22,120 --> 00:00:23,580
Why?

7
00:00:23,960 --> 00:00:27,160
Theoons are true

8
00:00:57,160 --> 00:01:02,160
I'm sorry, but I'm not sure if I can do it.

9
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:07,160
I'm sorry, but I'm not sure if I can do it.

10
00:01:07,160 --> 00:01:12,160
I'm sorry, but I'm not sure if I can do it.

11
00:01:12,160 --> 00:01:17,160
I'm sorry, but I'm not sure if I can do it.

12
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:22,160
I'm sorry, but I'm not sure if I can do it.

13
00:01:22,160 --> 00:01:27,160
I'm sorry, but I'm not sure if I can do it.

14
00:01:27,160 --> 00:01:32,160
I'm sorry, but I'm not sure if I can do it.

15
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:37,160
I'm sorry, but I'm not sure if I can do it.

16
00:01:37,160 --> 00:01:42,160
I'm sorry, but I'm not sure if I can do it.

17
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:57,160
Thank you.

18
00:01:57,160 --> 00:02:01,160
Thank you.

19
00:02:01,160 --> 00:02:05,160
Let's go.

20
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:08,160
Okay.

21
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:13,160
Take care.

22
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:16,160
Thank you, Mr. Bai.

23
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:19,160
Thank you.

24
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:25,160
Thank you.

25
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:46,160
I'm so tired.

26
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:48,160
Thank you.

27
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:51,160
Thank you.

28
00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:53,160
Everyone is free now, right?

29
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:55,160
Yes, we are free!

30
00:02:55,160 --> 00:02:57,160
Thank you, everyone!

31
00:02:57,160 --> 00:02:59,160
No need!

32
00:02:59,160 --> 00:03:01,160
No need!

33
00:03:01,160 --> 00:03:03,160
No need!

34
00:03:51,160 --> 00:04:01,160
I will have River King rules the whole world.

35
00:04:01,160 --> 00:04:04,600
What a frical job!

36
00:04:05,900 --> 00:04:09,280
What kind of job could a celebrity like this be?

37
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:12,840
You're deaf, but you have to handle the house.

38
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:14,480
What job?

39
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:15,740
Hard to handle?

40
00:04:15,740 --> 00:04:17,560
Can I even handle this?

41
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:23,060
Noporoo from reason

42
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:26,680
Imperingly...

43
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:30,880
Separated from their dawn

44
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:32,960
I'm going to make a little bit of a

45
00:05:03,300 --> 00:05:05,040
one

46
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:07,560
burger

47
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:13,100
chicken

48
00:05:16,140 --> 00:05:17,000
Yunshen

49
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,260
Though short

50
00:05:18,260 --> 00:05:19,620
You have like fire

51
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:23,220
With plenty of power

52
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:27,060
In next life

53
00:05:28,580 --> 00:05:30,220
I'll do nothing

54
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:34,960
I want to be an ordinary person.

55
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:37,400
Fei,

56
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:40,680
I wish you to be a human.

57
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:44,160
To live in a normal world,

58
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:47,360
and to be loved by the world.

59
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:50,520
To get

60
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:54,680
the peace and prosperity of the world.

61
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:05,960
The dream is so hard to forget.

62
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:08,960
Who will stop me?

63
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:10,960
Time is so short.

64
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:14,960
It's hard to get used to it.

65
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:17,960
Every time I pass by, I'm so confused.

66
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:21,960
I'm so confused.

67
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:26,960
I've seen the world before.

68
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:30,960
I don't know what to do with me.

69
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:32,960
I'll stay here.

70
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:36,960
As long as I'm here,

71
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:39,960
this world

72
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:42,960
won't forget you.

73
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:15,460
Rice

74
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:32,480
trophies made of rice

75
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:33,700
just like the years.

76
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:34,920
I chose

77
00:07:36,840 --> 00:07:39,000
Nihuang ...

78
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:49,000
A heart like a fairytale

79
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,440
leaps into him.

80
00:07:55,100 --> 00:07:57,560
She tried and truly got executed

81
00:07:57,560 --> 00:07:59,180
but at the opposite time she'd suffer great grief.

82
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:04,960
Even if I have a wish, I can always draw the land as old as I can.

83
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:22,960
Bai Jiu likes Ying Hong.

84
00:08:23,960 --> 00:08:25,960
He should be happy now.

85
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:28,960
You like it too?

86
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:38,960
You are more powerful than the little girls in the world in the Golden Age.

87
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:44,960
The Golden Age is also the world's treasure.

88
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:46,960
But we don't care much about it.

89
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:54,960
As a demon, you can use magic to make a bigger fire than the one in the world.

90
00:08:55,960 --> 00:08:57,960
Turn around.

91
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:29,960
Do you know that this kind of fire is cold?

92
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:31,960
Cold?

93
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:38,960
It looks dangerous, but it's not a problem.

94
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:51,960
The fire is so beautiful.

95
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:53,960
It's a pity that Xiao Zhu didn't see it.

96
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:55,960
He didn't eat the food for the whole day.

97
00:09:55,960 --> 00:09:56,960
I'm starving.

98
00:09:56,960 --> 00:09:57,960
Xiao Zhu.

99
00:09:57,960 --> 00:09:58,960
Go to the hotel tomorrow.

100
00:09:58,960 --> 00:09:59,960
I'll catch some rabbits for you.

101
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:00,960
Come on.

102
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:01,960
Don't be too greedy.

103
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:02,960
The three of us will be able to get through the competition.

104
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:03,960
We have to.

105
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:05,960
There is food and drink.

106
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:06,960
You don't have to be too polite.

107
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:10,960
Wenqiang.

108
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:22,960
Mingyue.

109
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:23,960
Taken several months cycle.

110
00:10:25,960 --> 00:10:26,960
Have you taught me to overlap?

111
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:27,960
Have you Childe Liu?

112
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:31,960
Are you sure?

113
00:10:31,960 --> 00:10:32,960
Yes.

114
00:10:44,860 --> 00:10:46,960
This is your имityyl phase.

115
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:47,960
Wen'yi has finallyworld.

116
00:10:47,960 --> 00:10:49,960
You should celebrate it tonight.

117
00:10:49,960 --> 00:10:51,160
I'm not going to sing.

118
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:52,920
You sing?

119
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:55,360
Do you want to listen?

120
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:03,560
What are you looking at?

121
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:05,560
I heard that Master Zhuo

122
00:11:05,560 --> 00:11:06,960
is a good dancer.

123
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:08,200
I'm so happy.

124
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:09,480
Come on.

125
00:11:11,160 --> 00:11:11,800
Come on.

126
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:13,880
This...

127
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:16,640
Brother Zhuo.

128
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:17,560
Come on.

129
00:11:17,560 --> 00:11:18,360
Master Zhuo.

130
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:19,080
Come on.

131
00:11:19,080 --> 00:11:19,800
Come on.

132
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:21,200
Brother Zhuo is good at dancing.

133
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:22,880
Good.

134
00:11:24,520 --> 00:11:25,800
I think it's okay.

135
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:28,480
Master Zhuo is not good at dancing.

136
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:30,200
It's too hard for him

137
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:32,120
to dance.

138
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:44,000
You're here.

139
00:11:44,280 --> 00:11:45,200
I can dance.

141
00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:48,600
You're a good dancer.

142
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:49,720
You should get up

143
00:11:49,720 --> 00:11:50,920

144
00:11:51,640 --> 00:11:52,480

00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,000
I'm sorry.

194
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,000
I'm sorry.

195
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,000
I'm sorry.

196
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,000
I'm sorry.

197
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,000
I'm sorry.

198
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,000
I'm sorry.

199
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
I'm sorry.

200
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,000
I'm sorry.

201
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,000
Sister.

202
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,000
I'm not in danger.

203
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,000
Why are you here?

204
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,000
I'm here to sit with you.

205
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,000
Sister, you're not eating.

206
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:43,000
If you don't eat, I'll eat.

207
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,000
I'll eat.

208
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,000
I'll eat.

209
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,000
I'll eat.

210
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,000
I'll eat.

211
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,000
I'll eat.

212
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,000
I'll eat.

213
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,000
I'll eat.

214
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,000
I'll eat.

215
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,000
I'll eat.

216
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,000
I'll eat.

217
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,000
I'll eat.

218
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,000
I'll eat.

219
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,000
I'll eat.

220
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,000
I'll eat.

221
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,000
I'll eat.

222
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,000
I'll eat.

223
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,000
I'll eat.

224
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,000
I'll eat.

225
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,000
Zhao Yunzhu, Zhao Yunzhu.

226
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,000
Zhao Yunzhu.

227
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,000
Jinx Barang.

228
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,000
Xiaojiu.

229
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,000
Wake up early tomorrow morning.

230
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,000
And you, Zhao Yunzhu.

231
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,000
Old!

232
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,000
Don't call themIDs.

233
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,820
Well, let's play the game now

234
00:16:46,300 --> 00:16:47,100
OK

235
00:16:52,120 --> 00:16:54,000
You have grass with a square삳

236
00:16:54,380 --> 00:16:56,020
And there is the cuckoo

237
00:16:56,660 --> 00:16:57,560
Why would I keep it?

238
00:16:58,840 --> 00:17:06,820
Called Honestlyc

239
00:17:06,820 --> 00:17:09,760
I can't let others be fooled up like us.

240
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:12,040
If someone lied to me,

241
00:17:12,040 --> 00:17:15,940
I might be overjoyed and nauseous with all this.

242
00:17:16,980 --> 00:17:20,480
I will know who Mazhu Blue LOL Cares was late.

243
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:22,620
Then, you start.

244
00:17:23,560 --> 00:17:25,440
Let's start!

245
00:17:25,440 --> 00:17:27,100
Okay.

246
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:39,740
thermal persuaded

247
00:17:42,860 --> 00:17:43,660
ordinary

248
00:17:46,820 --> 00:17:47,860
Sister Pei

249
00:17:49,020 --> 00:17:49,740
You

250
00:17:50,380 --> 00:17:52,460
Do you change your play composition?

251
00:17:52,460 --> 00:17:55,740
Are you Chongying's spy?

252
00:18:07,500 --> 00:18:08,700
What's going on?

253
00:18:10,340 --> 00:18:11,420
What do you mean?

254
00:18:12,860 --> 00:18:14,820
We received a letter from Mr. Situ.

255
00:18:15,860 --> 00:18:19,540
Someone told Chongying about it.

256
00:18:20,020 --> 00:18:24,860
That means we have a spy in Chongying.

257
00:18:30,180 --> 00:18:33,540
Chongying knows very well about our actions.

258
00:18:34,420 --> 00:18:36,100
That's why we're so busy.

259
00:18:37,060 --> 00:18:40,340
The less we know about Kunlun,

260
00:18:41,700 --> 00:18:43,500
the less Chongying can know about it.

261
00:18:43,860 --> 00:18:46,220
So we have to keep it secret.

262
00:18:46,540 --> 00:18:50,700
The law of Kunlun is to kill the villagers.

263
00:18:51,260 --> 00:18:53,420
We should go to Kunlun Mountain.

264
00:18:54,820 --> 00:18:56,420
Who affected the Eagle Teeth?

265
00:18:56,620 --> 00:19:00,340
It caused us to come to Sinali Water Town.

266
00:19:03,380 --> 00:19:04,060
Well...

267
00:19:04,060 --> 00:19:04,820
Sorry.

268
00:19:05,260 --> 00:19:07,180
When I was thinking about Kunlun Mountain,

269
00:19:07,180 --> 00:19:08,900
I suddenly thought of Mr. Pei.

270
00:19:09,060 --> 00:19:10,900
The Sinali Water Town in Kunlun Mountain.

271
00:19:11,340 --> 00:19:12,540
It's so hot.

272
00:19:12,700 --> 00:19:14,260
Who sent us here?

273
00:19:14,980 --> 00:19:16,700
Who sent us here?

274
00:19:17,420 --> 00:19:19,580
Let's find out.

275
00:19:20,020 --> 00:19:20,700
Wait.

276
00:19:21,300 --> 00:19:22,100
What?

277
00:19:22,260 --> 00:19:23,380
We're not guilty?

278
00:19:23,380 --> 00:19:24,700
Don't you think it's strange?

279
00:19:24,980 --> 00:19:26,220
They took away Xiaojiu.

280
00:19:26,380 --> 00:19:28,060
They want to take us there.

281
00:19:29,220 --> 00:19:31,060
Mr. Zhuo and Zhao Yanzhou are gone.

282
00:19:31,740 --> 00:19:34,380
They must be able to save Xiaojiu.

283
00:19:35,660 --> 00:19:37,020
They went to the commandment.

284
00:19:37,620 --> 00:19:39,860
They should wait here.

285
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:44,100
Wanhua,

286
00:19:46,260 --> 00:19:47,900
why do you look down on us?

287
00:19:51,900 --> 00:19:54,940
Are you hiding it at the ps cloudy?

288
00:19:57,780 --> 00:19:58,420
Well...

289
00:20:00,180 --> 00:20:00,980
No.

290
00:20:01,580 --> 00:20:03,380
Many waiters come all the way to you.

291
00:20:03,780 --> 00:20:06,220
I came here to Sachya.

292
00:20:06,220 --> 00:20:08,220
I'm scared

293
00:20:14,220 --> 00:20:15,220
Mr. Pei

294
00:20:16,220 --> 00:20:17,220
Are you okay?

295
00:20:32,220 --> 00:20:34,220
I'm scared, Pei Zui Xing

296
00:20:34,220 --> 00:20:35,220
You

297
00:20:36,220 --> 00:20:37,220
You are a little bit...

298
00:20:58,220 --> 00:21:01,220
This is what you call a positive

299
00:21:07,220 --> 00:21:08,220
I told you

300
00:21:09,220 --> 00:21:12,220
There's no way that time can change the mind

301
00:21:12,220 --> 00:21:16,220
The reason he went back to the Wanchu is because the grass didn't have a pig

302
00:21:16,220 --> 00:21:20,220
It was Mr. Pei Zui who used the water-based ice tree I called him

303
00:21:20,220 --> 00:21:22,220
to control the Wanchu of grass

304
00:21:31,220 --> 00:21:33,220
Mr. Pei Zui is not a good man

305
00:21:33,220 --> 00:21:37,220
I taught you the ability to get together with Wen Xiao to fool people

306
00:21:45,220 --> 00:21:47,220
You want to try me?

307
00:21:49,220 --> 00:21:50,220
Yes

308
00:21:51,220 --> 00:21:54,220
After all, you are the most capable of us six

309
00:22:04,220 --> 00:22:10,220
People in Wanchu will have a special English character

310
00:22:10,220 --> 00:22:12,220
representing their identity

311
00:22:12,220 --> 00:22:15,220
I have never recognized the commander of Wanchu

312
00:22:15,220 --> 00:22:17,220
This is not a secret

313
00:22:19,220 --> 00:22:21,220
But I have already been assigned to the command

314
00:22:22,220 --> 00:22:24,220
and Wanchu is not a bad guy

315
00:22:25,220 --> 00:22:29,220
Besides, I joined you because I was trying to sleep

316
00:22:30,220 --> 00:22:32,220
It's not you, is it?

317
00:22:35,220 --> 00:22:37,220
Besides, I was also hit by a plague in Lin Xi's wound

318
00:22:37,220 --> 00:22:39,220
I might die

319
00:22:39,220 --> 00:22:42,220
If I really did not play the role of a bad guy

320
00:22:43,220 --> 00:22:45,220
I would be so happy

321
00:22:49,220 --> 00:22:51,220
I think he makes sense

322
00:22:52,220 --> 00:22:55,220
Since we have a role in it

323
00:22:55,220 --> 00:22:57,220
then why can't this person be you?

324
00:23:00,220 --> 00:23:02,220
Sister Pei, you are so noisy

325
00:23:04,220 --> 00:23:07,220
I want to join the Chongying

326
00:23:07,220 --> 00:23:11,220
I heard that they have a lot of precious intelligence

327
00:23:11,220 --> 00:23:12,220
to deal with the plague

328
00:23:12,220 --> 00:23:14,220
But my father did not let me go

329
00:23:15,220 --> 00:23:17,220
I have never seen a person like you

330
00:23:17,220 --> 00:23:20,220
Every time a white girl is very nice to a demon

331
00:23:20,220 --> 00:23:21,220
I absolutely do not know

332
00:23:24,220 --> 00:23:29,220
A good demon is a half of the demon

333
00:23:29,220 --> 00:23:30,220
A demon

334
00:23:48,220 --> 00:23:50,220
Why do you look at me?

335
00:23:50,220 --> 00:23:52,220
How could I be a spy?

336
00:23:53,220 --> 00:23:54,220
Not necessarily

337
00:23:55,220 --> 00:23:57,220
If I were a spy

338
00:23:57,220 --> 00:24:00,220
why would I have to help you fulfill your mission

339
00:24:00,220 --> 00:24:03,220
I would be so tired to be a cow

340
00:24:03,220 --> 00:24:05,220
You are so bitter

341
00:24:05,220 --> 00:24:07,220
Anyway, you are so mean

342
00:24:09,220 --> 00:24:10,220
I am a demon

343
00:24:10,220 --> 00:24:12,220
I am a special killer

344
00:24:12,220 --> 00:24:15,220
Moreover, they also want to steal my internal order

345
00:24:15,220 --> 00:24:18,220
Chuo Xiaochen, please understand

346
00:24:20,220 --> 00:24:22,220
Please take a good look

347
00:24:23,220 --> 00:24:24,220
I remember someone said

348
00:24:24,220 --> 00:24:27,220
in the J14, there was a threat to the capital

349
00:24:27,220 --> 00:24:29,220
If we do not cooperate with you

350
00:24:29,220 --> 00:24:30,220
you will go to the Chongying

351
00:24:31,220 --> 00:24:34,220
The plan is all a plan

352
00:24:34,220 --> 00:24:36,220
Do you all believe in the plan?

353
00:24:38,220 --> 00:24:39,220
What's so interesting?

354
00:24:40,220 --> 00:24:42,220
A woman who can be a great woman

355
00:24:46,220 --> 00:24:48,220
The pain of the world

356
00:24:49,220 --> 00:24:51,220
is so painful

357
00:24:59,220 --> 00:25:00,220
Who is next?

358
00:25:01,220 --> 00:25:02,220
Him

359
00:25:13,220 --> 00:25:14,220
Me?

360
00:25:15,220 --> 00:25:17,220
I am a chef

361
00:25:17,220 --> 00:25:19,220
A chef is also suitable for the secret

362
00:25:19,220 --> 00:25:21,220
Before I met you

363
00:25:21,220 --> 00:25:24,220
I didn't know what I was doing in the J14

364
00:25:24,220 --> 00:25:27,220
Moreover, without my mountain and countryside

365
00:25:27,220 --> 00:25:28,220
we can't go back

366
00:25:28,220 --> 00:25:30,220
our heads are on the ground

367
00:25:30,220 --> 00:25:31,220
Yes

368
00:25:31,220 --> 00:25:32,220
Yes

369
00:25:32,220 --> 00:25:34,220
The little mountain god's plan

370
00:25:34,220 --> 00:25:35,220
is not yet complete

371
00:25:35,220 --> 00:25:37,220
Chongying can't see it

372
00:25:39,220 --> 00:25:43,220
The pain of the world is so painful

373
00:25:46,220 --> 00:25:48,220
Speaking of the mountain god's plan

374
00:25:48,220 --> 00:25:50,220
we rushed back to J14

375
00:25:50,220 --> 00:25:52,220
Who was it?

376
00:25:52,220 --> 00:25:54,220
We went to the mountain god's plan

377
00:25:54,220 --> 00:25:57,220
and almost got the ambush of Chongying

378
00:25:59,220 --> 00:26:01,220
I am just a doctor

379
00:26:01,220 --> 00:26:03,220
And I am going to the bank

380
00:26:03,220 --> 00:26:04,220
Ask me

381
00:26:04,220 --> 00:26:06,220
Chongying also has a doctor

382
00:26:06,220 --> 00:26:07,220
I don't know kung fu

383
00:26:07,220 --> 00:26:09,220
But you know how to take medicine

384
00:26:09,220 --> 00:26:10,220
and how to take pills

385
00:26:10,220 --> 00:26:11,220
and how to take needles

386
00:26:11,220 --> 00:26:13,220
You are not a normal doctor

387
00:26:15,220 --> 00:26:18,220
I am afraid of death, blood, and fever

388
00:26:18,220 --> 00:26:19,220
I am just a doctor

389
00:26:19,220 --> 00:26:21,220
because my mother is sick

390
00:26:21,220 --> 00:26:23,220
I want to cure my mother's illness

391
00:26:27,220 --> 00:26:29,220
Your mother's illness?

392
00:26:31,220 --> 00:26:34,220
If your wish is to cure your mother's illness

393
00:26:34,220 --> 00:26:37,220
Chongying has been in the hospital for more than a year

394
00:26:37,220 --> 00:26:41,220
and collected many herbs and talents

395
00:26:41,220 --> 00:26:44,220
Maybe one of them can help you realize your wish

396
00:26:44,220 --> 00:26:46,220
Maybe

397
00:26:48,220 --> 00:26:50,220
No need to say more

398
00:26:50,220 --> 00:26:52,220
Chongying's people

399
00:26:52,220 --> 00:26:54,220
have a female assassin every night

400
00:26:54,220 --> 00:26:56,220
and have a smoke

401
00:27:00,220 --> 00:27:01,220
Drink more

402
00:27:01,220 --> 00:27:02,220
I am thirsty

403
00:27:03,220 --> 00:27:04,220
I will have a drink

404
00:27:06,220 --> 00:27:07,220
It's just a little bit

405
00:27:07,220 --> 00:27:08,220
What's so good about it?

406
00:27:09,220 --> 00:27:11,220
I will have a drink

407
00:27:12,220 --> 00:27:13,220
Come on, Xiaojiu

408
00:27:25,220 --> 00:27:26,220
Little boy

409
00:27:29,220 --> 00:27:30,220
Baijiu

410
00:27:31,220 --> 00:27:33,220
We have to see your hand

411
00:27:42,220 --> 00:27:45,220
Actually, the person who is trying to kill you

412
00:27:45,220 --> 00:27:46,220
has a hint

413
00:27:48,220 --> 00:27:49,220
He hinted to us

414
00:27:50,220 --> 00:27:52,220
that the person who is most likely to be a spy

415
00:27:53,220 --> 00:27:54,220
is Baijiu

416
00:27:56,220 --> 00:27:57,220
I am not a spy

417
00:27:58,220 --> 00:27:59,220
Xiaozhu, believe me

418
00:28:00,220 --> 00:28:01,220
It's not true

419
00:28:06,220 --> 00:28:07,220
Then show your hand

420
00:28:07,220 --> 00:28:08,220
I will show my hand

421
00:28:09,220 --> 00:28:10,220
Then show your hand

422
00:28:11,220 --> 00:28:12,220
and see if you know

423
00:28:16,220 --> 00:28:18,220
Even if there is a cloud

424
00:28:18,220 --> 00:28:21,220
it can't be said that he is a spy

425
00:28:21,220 --> 00:28:22,220
Is there another possibility?

426
00:28:22,220 --> 00:28:23,220
So

427
00:28:25,220 --> 00:28:27,220
you have seen Baijiu's hand

428
00:28:28,220 --> 00:28:29,220
No

429
00:28:31,220 --> 00:28:33,220
I just asked

430
00:28:33,220 --> 00:28:34,220
Yinglei

431
00:28:35,220 --> 00:28:37,220
You are so stupid

432
00:28:38,220 --> 00:28:40,220
No, Xiaojiu is not a spy

433
00:28:40,220 --> 00:28:41,220
Think about it

434
00:28:41,220 --> 00:28:43,220
He is always in our treatment

435
00:28:43,220 --> 00:28:44,220
If he is not there

436
00:28:44,220 --> 00:28:45,220
he will die long ago

437
00:28:45,220 --> 00:28:46,220
And

438
00:28:47,220 --> 00:28:48,220
Don't say that

439
00:28:49,220 --> 00:28:50,220
You are not a spy

440
00:28:54,220 --> 00:28:55,220
You are a spy

441
00:28:56,220 --> 00:28:57,220
You are not a spy

442
00:29:01,220 --> 00:29:02,220
So is there a spy or not?

443
00:29:08,220 --> 00:29:09,220
I will show you

444
00:29:38,220 --> 00:29:39,220
Xiaozhu

445
00:29:43,220 --> 00:29:44,220
Xiaozhu

446
00:29:47,220 --> 00:29:48,220
Xiaozhu

447
00:29:49,220 --> 00:29:50,220
Xiaozhu

448
00:29:52,220 --> 00:29:53,220
Xiaozhu

449
00:29:57,220 --> 00:29:58,220
You are married

450
00:29:58,220 --> 00:29:59,220
You are married

451
00:30:07,220 --> 00:30:08,220
Baijiu

452
00:30:28,220 --> 00:30:29,220
Xiaojiu

453
00:30:29,220 --> 00:30:30,220
You are asleep

454
00:30:39,220 --> 00:30:40,220
Xiao Bai Tu

455
00:30:41,220 --> 00:30:42,220
We are too violent

456
00:30:43,220 --> 00:30:44,220
I will compensate you

457
00:30:44,220 --> 00:30:45,220
No

458
00:30:54,220 --> 00:30:55,220
Xiao Bai Tu

459
00:30:55,220 --> 00:30:56,220
We are too violent

460
00:30:56,220 --> 00:30:57,220
I will compensate you

461
00:31:07,220 --> 00:31:08,220
Xiaojiu

462
00:31:09,220 --> 00:31:11,220
I will give you all the time to die

463
00:31:11,220 --> 00:31:12,220
Don't be angry

464
00:31:25,220 --> 00:31:26,220
Xiaojiu

465
00:31:55,220 --> 00:31:56,220
Xiaojiu

466
00:32:25,220 --> 00:32:29,220
Why did you tell them

467
00:32:29,220 --> 00:32:31,220
about the spy and the spy?

468
00:32:33,220 --> 00:32:35,220
You know my relationship with Baijiu

469
00:32:35,220 --> 00:32:38,220
I really don't want her to risk it

470
00:32:38,220 --> 00:32:40,220
But if I stop her

471
00:32:40,220 --> 00:32:41,220
she will fight me

472
00:32:41,220 --> 00:32:43,220
That's why I will do this

473
00:32:45,220 --> 00:32:46,220
You

474
00:32:46,220 --> 00:32:47,220
My lord

475
00:32:47,220 --> 00:32:48,220
The spy found out

476
00:32:48,220 --> 00:32:51,220
He will secretly show the secret of the spy

477
00:32:51,220 --> 00:32:52,220
with a secret agent

478
00:32:52,220 --> 00:32:54,220
in the dark

479
00:32:54,220 --> 00:32:55,220
in the dark

480
00:32:55,220 --> 00:32:57,220
in the direction of Kunlun Mountain

481
00:33:24,220 --> 00:33:25,220
Xiaojiu

482
00:33:34,220 --> 00:33:35,220
Xiaojiu

483
00:33:45,220 --> 00:33:46,220
Xiao Bai Tu

484
00:33:47,220 --> 00:33:48,220
Xiaojiu

485
00:33:49,220 --> 00:33:50,220
Xiao Bai Tu

486
00:33:50,220 --> 00:33:51,220
Xiaojiu

487
00:33:51,220 --> 00:33:52,220
Xiaojiu

488
00:33:54,220 --> 00:33:56,220
The chief sent the chicken to us

489
00:34:02,220 --> 00:34:03,220
Xiaojiu

490
00:34:03,220 --> 00:34:04,220
Come and eat

491
00:34:04,220 --> 00:34:05,220
We will leave after eating

492
00:34:24,220 --> 00:34:27,220
It seems that Xiao Bai Tu cares the most

493
00:34:27,220 --> 00:34:28,220
is the hero in his heart

494
00:34:28,220 --> 00:34:29,220
Lord Xiao Zhuo

495
00:34:29,220 --> 00:34:31,220
You are too soft

496
00:34:31,220 --> 00:34:33,220
Are you sure you don't have to mess with him?

497
00:34:33,220 --> 00:34:35,220
Everyone is too soft

498
00:34:35,220 --> 00:34:37,220
How can you let me be alone?

499
00:34:38,220 --> 00:34:39,220
But he obviously

500
00:34:39,220 --> 00:34:41,220
hates you the most

501
00:34:43,220 --> 00:34:44,220
Zhao Yanzhou

502
00:34:44,220 --> 00:34:46,220
Are you happy now?

503
00:34:46,220 --> 00:34:47,220
I am happy

504
00:34:47,220 --> 00:34:48,220
I am happy

505
00:34:48,220 --> 00:34:49,220
I am happy

506
00:34:49,220 --> 00:34:50,220
I am happy

507
00:34:50,220 --> 00:34:51,220
I am happy

508
00:34:51,220 --> 00:34:52,220
I am happy

509
00:34:52,220 --> 00:34:53,220
I am happy

510
00:34:53,220 --> 00:34:54,220
I am happy

511
00:34:54,220 --> 00:34:55,220
Finally someone surpassed you

512
00:34:55,220 --> 00:34:57,220
and got the test

513
00:34:59,220 --> 00:35:01,220
Everyone is fine

514
00:35:01,220 --> 00:35:02,220
But Hong Xiao Hai

515
00:35:02,220 --> 00:35:03,220
is too difficult

516
00:35:03,220 --> 00:35:05,220
for our Lord Xiao Zhou

517
00:35:05,220 --> 00:35:07,220
Hong Xiao Hai

518
00:35:07,220 --> 00:35:08,220
It's easy

519
00:35:10,220 --> 00:35:11,220
It's easy to make him

520
00:35:11,220 --> 00:35:12,220
Give him candy

521
00:35:12,220 --> 00:35:14,220
Just touch his head

522
00:35:23,220 --> 00:35:24,220
Candy

523
00:35:53,220 --> 00:35:56,220
Everyone is very brave

524
00:35:56,220 --> 00:35:58,220
Please give a good look

525
00:35:58,220 --> 00:36:00,220
The first is Kunlun Mountain

526
00:36:00,220 --> 00:36:02,220
Shen Miao

527
00:36:06,220 --> 00:36:07,220
Let's go

528
00:36:23,220 --> 00:36:25,220
Come

529
00:36:54,220 --> 00:36:55,220
Come

530
00:36:58,220 --> 00:36:59,220
Come

531
00:37:05,220 --> 00:37:06,220
Come

532
00:37:06,220 --> 00:37:07,220
Come

533
00:37:07,220 --> 00:37:08,220
Let go

534
00:37:08,220 --> 00:37:09,220
Old man

535
00:37:09,220 --> 00:37:11,220
It's time for the feast

536
00:37:12,220 --> 00:37:14,220
Little Ying Lei is back

537
00:37:14,220 --> 00:37:15,220
What?

538
00:37:15,220 --> 00:37:16,220
Don't you have to

539
00:37:16,220 --> 00:37:18,220
pursue your great ideal?

540
00:37:18,220 --> 00:37:20,220
I still need to pursue

541
00:37:20,220 --> 00:37:22,220
not because I found the Baizi order

542
00:37:22,220 --> 00:37:24,220
I will come

543
00:37:24,220 --> 00:37:26,220
to the feast

544
00:37:29,220 --> 00:37:30,220
Lord Shen

545
00:37:31,220 --> 00:37:33,220
This is my grandfather Ying Zhao

546
00:37:33,220 --> 00:37:35,220
and the other is God of the Mountain

547
00:37:36,220 --> 00:37:38,220
Greetings, Lord Shen

548
00:37:40,220 --> 00:37:42,220
Thank you for taking back

549
00:37:42,220 --> 00:37:43,220
the Baizi order

550
00:37:43,220 --> 00:37:44,220
The God of the Mountain

551
00:37:44,220 --> 00:37:46,220
will obey your order

552
00:37:48,220 --> 00:37:49,220
Lord Zhuyin

553
00:37:49,220 --> 00:37:51,220
I just got back to the Baizi order

554
00:37:52,220 --> 00:37:54,220
Can you call me Lord?

555
00:37:54,220 --> 00:37:56,220
I dare not say anything

556
00:37:56,220 --> 00:37:58,220
I still need your advice

557
00:37:59,220 --> 00:38:01,220
You brat

558
00:38:02,220 --> 00:38:04,220
You really got back

559
00:38:04,220 --> 00:38:06,220
You brat

560
00:38:08,220 --> 00:38:09,220
I will hit you

561
00:38:09,220 --> 00:38:10,220
You are lying

562
00:38:10,220 --> 00:38:12,220
I will hit you

563
00:38:12,220 --> 00:38:14,220
You are a coward

564
00:38:14,220 --> 00:38:15,220
I said don't hit me

565
00:38:15,220 --> 00:38:16,220
I will hit you

566
00:38:17,220 --> 00:38:18,220
You are a coward

567
00:38:18,220 --> 00:38:19,220
Come here

568
00:38:19,220 --> 00:38:20,220
I will hit you

569
00:38:20,220 --> 00:38:21,220
I will hit you

570
00:38:21,220 --> 00:38:23,220
You are a coward

571
00:38:23,220 --> 00:38:24,220
I will hit you

572
00:38:24,220 --> 00:38:25,220
I will hit you

573
00:38:25,220 --> 00:38:26,220
I will hit you

574
00:38:26,220 --> 00:38:27,220
I will hit you

575
00:38:27,220 --> 00:38:28,220
I will tell you

576
00:38:28,220 --> 00:38:29,220
that you are a coward

577
00:38:29,220 --> 00:38:31,220
You can't even get back to the Baizi order

578
00:38:32,220 --> 00:38:33,220
You are a coward

579
00:38:33,220 --> 00:38:34,220
I will hit you

580
00:38:40,220 --> 00:38:42,220
You are the master of the legend

581
00:38:42,220 --> 00:38:44,220
Lord Shen knows me

582
00:38:44,220 --> 00:38:45,220
Legend says

583
00:38:45,220 --> 00:38:47,220
you are the most mysterious dragon god

584
00:38:48,220 --> 00:38:50,220
You can shine the darkest night

585
00:38:51,220 --> 00:38:53,220
like a demon

586
00:39:15,220 --> 00:39:17,220
I have served Zhuyin

587
00:39:17,220 --> 00:39:18,720
for years

588
00:39:21,220 --> 00:39:25,220
Now, Kunlun Mountain is about to be destroyed.

589
00:39:25,220 --> 00:39:28,220
The Great Emperor has chosen a new route.

590
00:39:31,220 --> 00:39:36,220
The 28 Star Cult has been destroyed.

591
00:39:36,220 --> 00:39:39,220
We have no power to go back to the Heavens.

592
00:39:39,220 --> 00:39:41,220
But now, the Goddess is back.

593
00:39:41,220 --> 00:39:43,220
She only needs to start the Star Formation.

594
00:39:43,220 --> 00:39:47,220
She can save the Great Emperor if she uses her power to save Bai Ze.

595
00:39:47,220 --> 00:39:49,220
There is something very strange.

596
00:39:50,220 --> 00:39:52,220
Grandpa Ying Zhao, you live well.

597
00:39:52,220 --> 00:39:54,220
You should help me analyze it.

598
00:39:55,220 --> 00:39:59,220
You are still so annoying.

599
00:39:59,220 --> 00:40:00,220
You are so annoying.

600
00:40:00,220 --> 00:40:02,220
What is it? Ask me.

601
00:40:03,220 --> 00:40:05,220
Bai Ze Ling has been dead for so long.

602
00:40:05,220 --> 00:40:07,220
I didn't expect that he is a child.

603
00:40:07,220 --> 00:40:10,220
He has been left in Lu Wo and Wen Xiao.

604
00:40:10,220 --> 00:40:15,220
But why can't he feel Bai Ze Ling's existence?

605
00:40:15,220 --> 00:40:18,220
From the first generation,

606
00:40:18,220 --> 00:40:20,220
to make peace,

607
00:40:20,220 --> 00:40:23,220
Bai Ze Ling has to be divided into two groups.

608
00:40:23,220 --> 00:40:26,220
One person, one demon, and one leader.

609
00:40:26,220 --> 00:40:31,220
These two leaders are both kind and mutual.

610
00:40:31,220 --> 00:40:34,220
They can start and develop power.

611
00:40:34,220 --> 00:40:35,220
No.

612
00:40:45,220 --> 00:40:47,220
It's too sudden.

613
00:40:52,220 --> 00:40:55,220
Since the Goddess has regained her power,

614
00:40:55,220 --> 00:40:58,220
I think you two have both trust each other.

615
00:40:58,220 --> 00:41:00,220
We have both faith in each other.

616
00:41:04,220 --> 00:41:06,220
You are so despicable.

617
00:41:06,220 --> 00:41:09,220
Xiao Zhuo and Sister Wen have been together since childhood.

618
00:41:09,220 --> 00:41:11,220
You are so ridiculous.

619
00:41:11,220 --> 00:41:13,220
What's wrong with mutual love?

620
00:41:13,220 --> 00:41:15,220
Friendship is love.

621
00:41:15,220 --> 00:41:17,220
We are close friends.

622
00:41:17,220 --> 00:41:19,220
We are together all the time.

623
00:41:19,220 --> 00:41:21,220
We are close friends.

624
00:41:21,220 --> 00:41:23,220
Don't be so anxious.

625
00:41:23,220 --> 00:41:26,220
You are so strict.

626
00:41:27,220 --> 00:41:29,220
Don't talk about this.

627
00:41:29,220 --> 00:41:32,220
Let's hurry up and open the magic.

628
00:41:32,220 --> 00:41:36,220
But Kunlun Mountain's spiritual power has already failed.

629
00:41:36,220 --> 00:41:39,220
The Star Formation needs a lot of spiritual power.

630
00:41:39,220 --> 00:41:41,220
It's best to bring it to the 50th.

631
00:41:41,220 --> 00:41:45,220
The heavenly power will be activated at the right time.

632
00:41:47,220 --> 00:41:49,220
Let's wait until tomorrow.

633
00:41:54,220 --> 00:41:57,220
Take them to the water town in Sinan.

634
00:41:57,220 --> 00:41:58,220
Can you do it?

635
00:41:58,220 --> 00:42:00,220
When do you want to take them?

636
00:42:00,220 --> 00:42:03,220
You can't go and you can't be late.

637
00:42:30,220 --> 00:42:32,220
I'm sorry.

638
00:42:32,220 --> 00:42:34,220
I'm sorry.

639
00:42:34,220 --> 00:42:36,220
I'm sorry.

640
00:42:36,220 --> 00:42:38,220
I'm sorry.

641
00:42:38,220 --> 00:42:40,220
I'm sorry.

642
00:42:40,220 --> 00:42:42,220
I'm sorry.

643
00:42:42,220 --> 00:42:44,220
I'm sorry.

644
00:42:44,220 --> 00:42:46,220
I'm sorry.

645
00:42:46,220 --> 00:42:48,220
I'm sorry.

646
00:42:48,220 --> 00:42:50,220
I'm sorry.

647
00:42:50,220 --> 00:42:52,220
I'm sorry.

648
00:42:52,220 --> 00:42:54,220
I'm sorry.

649
00:42:54,220 --> 00:42:56,220
I'm sorry.

650
00:42:56,220 --> 00:42:58,220
I'm sorry.

651
00:42:58,220 --> 00:43:00,220
I'm sorry.

652
00:43:00,220 --> 00:43:02,220
I'm sorry.

653
00:43:02,220 --> 00:43:04,220
I'm sorry.

654
00:43:04,220 --> 00:43:06,220
I'm sorry.

655
00:43:06,220 --> 00:43:08,220
I'm sorry.

656
00:43:08,220 --> 00:43:10,220
I'm sorry.

657
00:43:10,220 --> 00:43:12,220
I'm sorry.

658
00:43:12,220 --> 00:43:14,220
I'm sorry.

659
00:43:14,220 --> 00:43:16,220
I'm sorry.

660
00:43:16,220 --> 00:43:18,220
I'm sorry.

661
00:43:18,220 --> 00:43:20,220
I'm sorry.

662
00:43:20,220 --> 00:43:22,220
I'm sorry.

663
00:43:22,220 --> 00:43:24,220
I'm sorry.

664
00:43:24,220 --> 00:43:26,220
I'm sorry.

665
00:43:26,220 --> 00:43:28,220
I'm sorry.

666
00:43:28,220 --> 00:43:30,220
I'm sorry.

667
00:43:30,220 --> 00:43:32,220
I'm sorry.

668
00:43:32,220 --> 00:43:34,220
I'm sorry.

669
00:43:34,220 --> 00:43:36,220
I'm sorry.

670
00:43:36,220 --> 00:43:38,220
I'm sorry.

671
00:43:38,220 --> 00:43:40,220
I'm sorry.

672
00:43:40,220 --> 00:43:42,220
I'm sorry.

673
00:43:42,220 --> 00:43:44,220
I'm sorry.

674
00:43:44,220 --> 00:43:46,220
I'm sorry.

675
00:43:46,220 --> 00:43:48,220
I'm sorry.

676
00:43:48,220 --> 00:43:50,220
I'm sorry.

677
00:43:50,220 --> 00:43:52,220
I'm sorry.

678
00:43:52,220 --> 00:43:54,220
I'm sorry.
