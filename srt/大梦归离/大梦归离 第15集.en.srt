[Episode 15]

3
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:48,710
If the two halves of the Baize Token are merged outside our bodies,

4
00:01:48,710 --> 00:01:50,470
can it be returned

5
00:01:50,630 --> 00:01:52,500
to Baize Goddess?

6
00:01:53,030 --> 00:01:54,229
Brat,

7
00:01:54,229 --> 00:01:56,150
you finally said that.

8
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:57,880
So you know your place.

9
00:01:58,070 --> 00:02:00,430
I thought you were going to keep it for yourself.

10
00:01:58,130 --> 00:02:00,790
♫A lone boat drifts through the world♫

11
00:02:00,550 --> 00:02:01,990
I don't want it.

12
00:02:00,820 --> 00:02:03,330
♫The heart feels bitter, then sweet♫

13
00:02:02,510 --> 00:02:03,670
The responsibility is too heavy.

14
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:08,590
♫Can't distinguish night from day♫

15
00:02:04,630 --> 00:02:07,030
I just want to be a free great demon.

16
00:02:08,020 --> 00:02:09,270
Go wherever I want

17
00:02:09,669 --> 00:02:11,020
and do whatever I want

18
00:02:09,910 --> 00:02:11,760
♫At the edge of the dreamscape♫

19
00:02:11,430 --> 00:02:12,690
without a care in the world.

20
00:02:11,910 --> 00:02:14,630
♫Someone is longing for♫

♫A past that can't be brought back♫

23
00:02:17,550 --> 00:02:19,190
Activating the Constellation Formation

24
00:02:19,190 --> 00:02:21,760
requires two Mountain Gods.

25
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:22,750
By then,

26
00:02:22,750 --> 00:02:23,590
Zhu Yin and I

27
00:02:23,670 --> 00:02:24,950
will assist them

28
00:02:25,230 --> 00:02:26,030
from the side.

29
00:02:27,070 --> 00:02:28,070
You two

30
00:02:28,110 --> 00:02:29,390
just need to

31
00:02:29,750 --> 00:02:32,310
activate the Baize Token in the formation.

32
00:02:33,990 --> 00:02:34,820
Great.

33
00:02:35,310 --> 00:02:36,910
The Wilderness can be saved.

34
00:02:49,410 --> 00:02:50,400
Sister Pei.

35
00:02:57,530 --> 00:02:59,990
Zhuo is still up there trying to cheer Jiu up.

36
00:03:00,530 --> 00:03:01,930
Jiu is too young.

37
00:03:02,790 --> 00:03:05,450
He doesn't understand that it wasn't personal.

38
00:03:05,710 --> 00:03:07,750
It's just that the situation was perilous

39
00:03:07,750 --> 00:03:09,080
and we had to be careful.

40
00:03:09,270 --> 00:03:10,390
You're right.

41
00:03:12,870 --> 00:03:14,350
But the plan of the Demon Hunting Bureau

42
00:03:14,350 --> 00:03:16,480
was indeed leaked to the Chongwu Camp.

43
00:03:17,100 --> 00:03:18,800
So I don't think

44
00:03:19,150 --> 00:03:21,050
Mr. Situ is mistaken

45
00:03:21,110 --> 00:03:22,340
about the mole.

46
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:27,260
By the way, Sister Pei,

47
00:03:27,750 --> 00:03:28,880
where are you going?

48
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:35,420
The Chongwu Camp is great at tracking,

49
00:03:35,860 --> 00:03:37,520
especially tracking demons.

50
00:03:37,790 --> 00:03:39,320
They've never failed at it.

51
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:40,610
Maybe

52
00:03:41,020 --> 00:03:42,970
they tracked Zhao Yuanzhou here.

53
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:45,600
For safety's sake,

54
00:03:45,780 --> 00:03:47,450
I'll go check the perimeter.

55
00:04:11,430 --> 00:04:12,560
I'm just a kid.

56
00:04:12,830 --> 00:04:14,120
It's easy to cheer me up.

57
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:15,400
Just some candy

58
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:16,860
or a pat on the head will do.

59
00:04:21,589 --> 00:04:23,050
Did you just throw it at me?

60
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:39,220
Don't you like fruit?

61
00:05:19,350 --> 00:05:20,150
Grandpa.

62
00:05:21,100 --> 00:05:22,290
All these years,

63
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:23,750
you've been protecting Mount Kunlun,

64
00:05:23,750 --> 00:05:25,530
which is on the brink of destruction.

65
00:05:25,530 --> 00:05:26,810
Don't you feel tired?

66
00:05:27,950 --> 00:05:29,070
I do,

67
00:05:30,790 --> 00:05:32,150
but it's my duty.

68
00:05:36,990 --> 00:05:37,790
Boy,

69
00:05:38,830 --> 00:05:41,070
do you know what it takes

70
00:05:41,070 --> 00:05:42,600
to become the Mountain God?

71
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:46,140
One needs to have divine blood

72
00:05:46,730 --> 00:05:48,530
and be very powerful.

73
00:05:51,700 --> 00:05:53,140
Wrong.

74
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:56,350
What makes you the Mountain God

75
00:05:57,230 --> 00:05:58,510
is your determination

76
00:05:58,510 --> 00:06:01,720
to protect the Wilderness.

77
00:06:10,060 --> 00:06:10,990
Boy.

78
00:06:13,210 --> 00:06:15,040
Whether to stay in the Wilderness

79
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:16,610
or go to the mortal world

80
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:18,380
is your decision

81
00:06:18,410 --> 00:06:19,880
to make.

82
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:22,730
No matter what your choice is,

83
00:06:23,460 --> 00:06:25,120
I'll support you.

84
00:06:26,310 --> 00:06:27,150
In this world,

85
00:06:27,630 --> 00:06:29,410
there are thousands of paths

86
00:06:29,590 --> 00:06:31,440
leading to your destination.

87
00:06:32,440 --> 00:06:34,990
As for which one is right for you,

88
00:06:36,430 --> 00:06:38,090
you have to find out yourself.

89
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:02,150
Sure enough.

90
00:07:02,150 --> 00:07:02,830
You wouldn't waste

91
00:07:02,830 --> 00:07:04,590
the fruit Mr. Zhuo gave you.

92
00:07:05,150 --> 00:07:06,410
None of your business.

93
00:07:07,950 --> 00:07:10,530
Looks like Zhuo messed up his apology.

94
00:07:10,990 --> 00:07:12,640
He's really stupid.

95
00:07:16,110 --> 00:07:17,320
I called him stupid.

96
00:07:17,430 --> 00:07:18,690
Why are you angry?

97
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:20,380
If they had suspected you,

98
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:21,960
would you be angry?

99
00:07:22,670 --> 00:07:24,670
As long as I have a clear conscience,

100
00:07:24,910 --> 00:07:26,510
I don't care

101
00:07:26,630 --> 00:07:27,960
what others think of me.

102
00:07:32,950 --> 00:07:34,409
But rumors are scary.

103
00:07:34,830 --> 00:07:36,220
Born in the Wilderness,

104
00:07:37,030 --> 00:07:39,490
you naturally don't know what rumors can do.

105
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:41,970
So it's better to be a demon.

106
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:44,240
I don't need to guess what others think.

107
00:07:45,870 --> 00:07:46,790
Where are you going?

108
00:07:46,790 --> 00:07:48,320
I'm going to do something bad.

109
00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:50,120
To find some demons and have fun.

110
00:07:51,380 --> 00:07:52,990
When did Little Bunny learn

111
00:07:52,990 --> 00:07:54,390
to speak sarcastically?

112
00:07:54,710 --> 00:07:56,110
You've rubbed off on him.

113
00:08:04,310 --> 00:08:05,670
It's just the two of us now.

114
00:08:05,670 --> 00:08:06,300
Tell me.

115
00:08:14,190 --> 00:08:14,990
Tell you what?

116
00:08:16,350 --> 00:08:17,700
What day is it tomorrow?

117
00:08:17,910 --> 00:08:19,270
What will happen?

118
00:08:20,450 --> 00:08:22,160
You looked worried just now.

119
00:08:22,270 --> 00:08:24,730
There's definitely something on your mind.

120
00:08:25,790 --> 00:08:27,430
Lady Goddess, I didn't expect you

121
00:08:27,430 --> 00:08:29,030
to pay so much attention to me.

122
00:08:29,030 --> 00:08:30,110
I'm so touched.

123
00:08:31,910 --> 00:08:33,140
I have no choice.

124
00:08:33,549 --> 00:08:35,270
To make the Baize Token complete,

125
00:08:35,270 --> 00:08:36,950
we must be of one mind.

126
00:08:42,630 --> 00:08:44,070
You once asked me

127
00:08:45,150 --> 00:08:47,480
why I was controlled by malicious energy.

128
00:08:51,030 --> 00:08:52,670
You didn't answer me then.

129
00:08:57,030 --> 00:08:58,670
The night I lost control,

130
00:09:00,390 --> 00:09:01,780
it was a blood moon.

131
00:09:05,790 --> 00:09:06,590
Blood moon?

132
00:09:08,030 --> 00:09:09,390
On a blood moon,

133
00:09:10,380 --> 00:09:12,380
malicious energy is the strongest.

134
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:16,120
With so much malicious energy in me,

135
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:18,830
if I can't control it,

136
00:09:19,890 --> 00:09:21,440
I'll be consumed by it.

137
00:09:27,150 --> 00:09:28,370
You mean…

138
00:09:31,070 --> 00:09:32,150
Tomorrow night…

139
00:09:38,310 --> 00:09:39,430
Are you worried

140
00:09:40,150 --> 00:09:41,810
you may lose control again?

141
00:09:43,790 --> 00:09:45,350
On that blood moon,

142
00:09:47,460 --> 00:09:49,520
malicious energy took control of me,

143
00:09:50,340 --> 00:09:51,940
and I lost consciousness.

144
00:09:53,610 --> 00:09:55,140
In a trance,

145
00:09:58,440 --> 00:10:01,300
I killed many people from the Demon Hunting Bureau.

146
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:09,130
Logically speaking,

147
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:11,770
the blood moon would last the whole night.

148
00:10:12,380 --> 00:10:13,550
But somehow,

149
00:10:14,580 --> 00:10:15,630
that night,

150
00:10:16,470 --> 00:10:18,560
I regained my sanity very soon.

151
00:10:19,430 --> 00:10:20,360
When I woke up,

152
00:10:21,110 --> 00:10:22,860
I was already inside the White Emperor Tower.

153
00:10:22,860 --> 00:10:26,090
[The Wilderness]

154
00:10:30,180 --> 00:10:31,980
I never understood the reason.

155
00:10:34,750 --> 00:10:36,150
Now that I think about it,

156
00:10:36,630 --> 00:10:38,220
your master, Zhao Wan'er,

157
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:40,360
must have sent half of the Baize Token

158
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:41,910
into my body

159
00:10:42,740 --> 00:10:45,600
to suppress the uncontrollable malicious energy.

160
00:10:46,870 --> 00:10:48,150
Otherwise,

161
00:10:50,060 --> 00:10:52,720
the consequences would've been unimaginable.

162
00:10:53,610 --> 00:10:55,410
You went through so much trouble

163
00:10:55,550 --> 00:10:57,810
to help me find the Baize Token

164
00:10:58,590 --> 00:10:59,630
just to...

165
00:10:59,830 --> 00:11:00,850
To end my life.

166
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:08,390
My wish can be fulfilled,

167
00:11:09,640 --> 00:11:11,900
and you can rid the world of a great demon.

168
00:11:18,750 --> 00:11:21,010
Do you know why your master, Zhao Wan'er,

169
00:11:21,700 --> 00:11:23,780
gave her brother's name

170
00:11:24,270 --> 00:11:25,230
to me?

171
00:11:27,630 --> 00:11:28,590
No.

172
00:11:33,020 --> 00:11:34,860
I asked her that question.

173
00:11:35,940 --> 00:11:37,470
She told me…

174
00:11:41,110 --> 00:11:42,970
it's because I was like a prisoner

175
00:11:44,030 --> 00:11:45,290
in a sea of bitterness.

176
00:11:47,190 --> 00:11:47,990
Death

177
00:11:50,100 --> 00:11:52,680
is my only escape.

178
00:11:58,430 --> 00:12:00,290
If I lose control again tomorrow,

179
00:12:03,670 --> 00:12:05,900
you must kill me with the Baize Token.

180
00:12:45,830 --> 00:12:46,750
Boys,

181
00:12:47,510 --> 00:12:48,710
wait a little longer.

182
00:12:50,100 --> 00:12:52,790
It's about time to hunt.

183
00:12:57,550 --> 00:12:58,910
If…

184
00:13:00,030 --> 00:13:01,960
the Baize Token stays in your body,

185
00:13:03,790 --> 00:13:06,310
you won't be consumed by malicious energy

186
00:13:08,110 --> 00:13:09,640
and lose control, will you?

187
00:13:10,950 --> 00:13:11,750
No.

188
00:13:13,860 --> 00:13:16,460
But to activate the Constellation Formation,

189
00:13:17,870 --> 00:13:20,470
the Baize Token must be merged outside my body.

190
00:13:22,430 --> 00:13:24,630
The formation will be finished by noon.

191
00:13:26,300 --> 00:13:27,310
After that,

192
00:13:27,430 --> 00:13:29,630
can't we divide the Baize Token into two

193
00:13:29,670 --> 00:13:32,150
and send a half back into your body?

194
00:13:39,390 --> 00:13:41,720
It's better than letting you lose control

195
00:13:41,830 --> 00:13:43,290
and start a killing spree.

196
00:13:48,430 --> 00:13:49,480
You can actually…

197
00:13:51,930 --> 00:13:53,410
sympathize with a demon?

198
00:13:54,370 --> 00:13:56,110
Demons are born aggressive.

199
00:13:56,440 --> 00:13:58,640
That's why they need to be disciplined.

200
00:13:59,740 --> 00:14:01,800
Demons wish to be accepted by humans.

201
00:14:02,590 --> 00:14:04,250
We also wish

202
00:14:04,350 --> 00:14:05,750
demons wouldn't hurt us.

203
00:14:06,630 --> 00:14:09,190
But there are always demons disguised as humans

204
00:14:09,190 --> 00:14:11,050
causing chaos in the mortal world

205
00:14:11,830 --> 00:14:13,150
and spreading fear.

206
00:14:22,840 --> 00:14:25,640
You always say you can't hate the Wilderness more,

207
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:27,260
but actually,

208
00:14:28,270 --> 00:14:30,130
you love it more than anyone else,

209
00:14:31,550 --> 00:14:32,510
don't you?

210
00:14:38,730 --> 00:14:39,410
I…

211
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:47,170
What's wrong?

212
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:51,980
It's happened a lot recently.

213
00:14:52,630 --> 00:14:53,960
It's not the first time.

214
00:14:55,270 --> 00:14:56,530
What's wrong with you?

215
00:14:57,180 --> 00:14:59,910
It's all because of the contract you made me sign.

216
00:15:01,590 --> 00:15:03,120
Which term did you violate?

217
00:15:05,870 --> 00:15:07,220
The one that says

218
00:15:07,550 --> 00:15:09,280
I shall stay with you willingly

219
00:15:10,230 --> 00:15:11,630
as your colleague.

220
00:15:19,050 --> 00:15:20,860
You broke the contract.

221
00:15:21,660 --> 00:15:22,990
You deserve the pain.

222
00:15:25,830 --> 00:15:27,270
You're so cruel.

223
00:15:32,950 --> 00:15:33,830
No way.

224
00:15:33,830 --> 00:15:34,670
I'm pretty and kind,

225
00:15:34,670 --> 00:15:35,190
okay?

226
00:15:36,190 --> 00:15:37,590
Since you're so pitiful,

227
00:15:37,590 --> 00:15:39,330
I'll teach you a spell

228
00:15:39,370 --> 00:15:41,050
to relieve your pain.

229
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:43,920
There's such a spell?

230
00:15:44,350 --> 00:15:44,870
Yes.

231
00:15:45,210 --> 00:15:46,940
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

232
00:15:49,300 --> 00:15:50,760
Form is indeed emptiness,

233
00:15:51,320 --> 00:15:52,650
emptiness indeed form.

234
00:15:57,110 --> 00:15:58,570
It's from the Heart Sutra.

235
00:15:58,630 --> 00:16:00,010
Recite it now and then.

236
00:16:00,670 --> 00:16:01,270
Clear the bad ideas

237
00:16:01,270 --> 00:16:02,550
from your mind.

238
00:16:08,310 --> 00:16:09,470
Look at Zhuo

239
00:16:09,470 --> 00:16:10,310
and then you.

240
00:16:10,990 --> 00:16:12,390
You're not in his league.

241
00:16:13,860 --> 00:16:15,690
Zhuo is like your brother.

242
00:16:15,760 --> 00:16:17,290
Of course we're different.

243
00:16:18,230 --> 00:16:20,990
You assume that Zhuo is like a brother to me.

244
00:16:20,990 --> 00:16:22,450
I don't think he'll agree.

245
00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:24,920
What else could he be?

246
00:16:25,790 --> 00:16:26,790
Who knows?

247
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:29,190
After all, Zhuo is so handsome

248
00:16:29,390 --> 00:16:32,390
that he's the dreamboat of countless girls in Tiandu.

249
00:16:32,670 --> 00:16:34,620
And he and I grew up together.

250
00:16:36,840 --> 00:16:37,640
Listen.

251
00:16:43,550 --> 00:16:44,510
What?

252
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:49,150
The sound of jealousy.

253
00:17:12,589 --> 00:17:14,190
I know I can't persuade you,

254
00:17:15,150 --> 00:17:16,430
but I believe

255
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:17,960
that one day

256
00:17:17,990 --> 00:17:20,720
you'll meet the person who makes you want to live.

267
00:18:39,630 --> 00:18:41,560
Ms. Pei, you're really something.

268
00:18:42,370 --> 00:18:44,230
You actually found me here.

269
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:50,660
Jiu.

270
00:18:55,580 --> 00:18:57,620
Mr. Zhuo, you're so diligent.

271
00:18:58,270 --> 00:18:59,860
At this hour, instead of sleeping,

272
00:18:59,860 --> 00:19:01,910
you're secretly practicing swordsmanship.

273
00:19:01,910 --> 00:19:03,110
The sooner I learn it,

274
00:19:04,190 --> 00:19:05,520
the sooner I can kill you

275
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:08,070
to fulfill your wish.

276
00:19:08,680 --> 00:19:10,200
It's a win-win.

277
00:19:10,830 --> 00:19:12,690
Of course I need to practice hard.

278
00:19:13,610 --> 00:19:15,140
Practice makes perfect,

279
00:19:15,550 --> 00:19:17,090
but if you do it wrongly

280
00:19:17,290 --> 00:19:18,750
and get ahead of yourself,

281
00:19:18,840 --> 00:19:20,600
you'll hurt yourself.

282
00:19:23,610 --> 00:19:24,870
None of your business.

283
00:19:25,430 --> 00:19:26,550
I taught you this.

284
00:19:27,180 --> 00:19:28,710
Of course it's my business.

285
00:20:41,740 --> 00:20:42,580
Who is he?

286
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:44,330
Your ancestor,

287
00:20:44,710 --> 00:20:45,430
Bingyi,

288
00:20:46,010 --> 00:20:48,340
the first master of the Cloud Light Sword.

289
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:53,560
The sword technique just now...

290
00:20:53,560 --> 00:20:55,670
Was the very one Bingyi used

291
00:20:55,700 --> 00:20:56,980
to slay Ying Long.

292
00:20:58,680 --> 00:20:59,800
Can it kill you?

293
00:21:01,270 --> 00:21:03,330
Ying Long was much stronger than I am.

294
00:21:03,530 --> 00:21:05,190
He was an ancient great demon.

295
00:21:05,340 --> 00:21:06,800
If it could kill Ying Long,

296
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:08,560
so of course, it could kill me too.

297
00:21:08,560 --> 00:21:10,360
Take your time to understand it.

298
00:21:12,820 --> 00:21:14,150
Why are you teaching me?

299
00:21:15,050 --> 00:21:16,510
Didn't I already tell you?

300
00:21:16,750 --> 00:21:18,030
I want you to kill me.

301
00:21:19,190 --> 00:21:20,350
You're lying.

302
00:21:21,720 --> 00:21:22,560
I'm not.

303
00:21:22,590 --> 00:21:23,950
When you made the oath with me

304
00:21:23,950 --> 00:21:25,430
in the dungeon back then,

305
00:21:25,530 --> 00:21:26,930
you truly weren't lying.

306
00:21:29,790 --> 00:21:32,660
I'll teach you the true way to use the Cloud Light Sword.

307
00:21:32,660 --> 00:21:33,670
Then...

308
00:21:33,770 --> 00:21:35,320
Kill me.

309
00:21:36,500 --> 00:21:37,940
Back then, you were consumed

310
00:21:37,940 --> 00:21:39,070
by a desire for death,

311
00:21:39,070 --> 00:21:40,870
and your eyes were void of light.

312
00:21:41,670 --> 00:21:42,760
But now,

313
00:21:43,450 --> 00:21:44,570
I can see that

314
00:21:44,780 --> 00:21:46,180
you no longer wish to die.

315
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:53,090
Is it because of Wen Xiao?

316
00:21:57,970 --> 00:21:59,830
I've always found the Wilderness

317
00:21:59,830 --> 00:22:01,340
to be cold and lifeless.

318
00:22:01,680 --> 00:22:04,010
Living for a thousand years has been dull.

319
00:22:04,630 --> 00:22:07,320
But after wandering the mortal world a few times,

320
00:22:07,320 --> 00:22:09,300
I found that mortal hearts

321
00:22:09,510 --> 00:22:10,710
have their own charm.

322
00:22:11,110 --> 00:22:12,840
So, for now, I don't want to die.

323
00:22:13,470 --> 00:22:14,330
Zhao Yuanzhou,

324
00:22:14,870 --> 00:22:15,970
trust me.

325
00:22:16,300 --> 00:22:17,380
The further you go,

326
00:22:17,540 --> 00:22:19,070
the less you'll want to die.

327
00:22:19,680 --> 00:22:21,740
No matter how well you treat Wen Xiao,

328
00:22:21,870 --> 00:22:23,670
I've already sworn a deadly oath

329
00:22:24,350 --> 00:22:25,510
that one day,

330
00:22:26,590 --> 00:22:28,510
I will kill you with my sword.

331
00:22:30,350 --> 00:22:33,210
If I truly grasp the essence of the Cloud Light Sword

332
00:22:33,950 --> 00:22:36,280
and master the technique in the illusion,

333
00:22:37,560 --> 00:22:38,760
won't you regret it?

334
00:22:44,310 --> 00:22:45,270
No, I won't.

335
00:22:48,710 --> 00:22:49,840
I don't understand.

336
00:22:50,230 --> 00:22:51,200
Why?

337
00:22:52,300 --> 00:22:54,030
Since you no longer want to die,

338
00:22:54,620 --> 00:22:56,280
why are you still teaching me?

339

so Wen Xiao and the others can focus on their spellcasting.

390

No problem.

It's noon now.

392
00:25:10,060 --> 00:25:12,230
Once the formation begins,

393
00:25:12,250 --> 00:25:13,710
it cannot be interrupted.

394
00:25:14,030 --> 00:25:15,060
Are you

395
00:25:15,310 --> 00:25:16,990
all prepared?

396
00:25:22,840 --> 00:25:23,860
Yes.

397
00:26:15,710 --> 00:26:17,910
Finally.

398
00:26:29,270 --> 00:26:30,260
Zhu Yin,

399
00:26:31,260 --> 00:26:32,460
start the formation!

400
00:26:33,870 --> 00:26:35,730
The stars align

401
00:26:35,990 --> 00:26:37,820
to stabilize the universe.

402
00:26:38,110 --> 00:26:38,830

403

All sources converge.

404
00:26:55,100 --> 00:26:57,200
Yin and Yang reflect each other,

405
00:26:57,390 --> 00:26:59,450
and heaven and earth work in harmony.

406
00:27:00,150 --> 00:27:00,950

407
00:27:01,750 --> 00:27:02,670

409
00:28:45,560 --> 00:28:46,300
Zhu Yin,

410
00:28:46,330 --> 00:28:46,930
you...

411
00:28:48,100 --> 00:28:49,020
Zhu Yin,

412
00:28:50,030 --> 00:28:52,360
I knew there was something wrong with you.

413
00:28:58,370 --> 00:29:01,830
The Star Formation requires two Mountain Gods to complete it.

414
00:29:02,150 --> 00:29:03,080
Ying Zhao,

415
00:29:03,490 --> 00:29:05,320
it's useless for you to hold on alone.

416
00:29:05,320 --> 00:29:07,580
Stop dreaming of saving the Wilderness.

417
00:29:46,390 --> 00:29:47,520
It's you?

418
00:29:47,750 --> 00:29:48,830
Mr. Zhuo,

419
00:29:49,070 --> 00:29:50,320
we meet again.

420
00:30:05,460 --> 00:30:06,790
No, something's wrong.

421
00:30:07,210 --> 00:30:08,310
They are not humans

422
00:30:10,860 --> 00:30:12,060
nor demons.

423
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:14,040
They are...

424
00:30:15,750 --> 00:30:16,550
They are...

425
00:30:21,950 --> 00:30:22,670
Ying Lei.

426
00:30:23,750 --> 00:30:24,880
Fall back behind me.

427
00:31:21,220 --> 00:31:22,340
Fish scales?

428
00:31:23,150 --> 00:31:24,490
That's Henggong fish from the Wilderness!

429
00:31:24,490 --> 00:31:25,860
Henggong fish?

430
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:35,260
The scales of Ran Yi are incredibly rare.

431
00:31:35,630 --> 00:31:36,790
Here, take these.

432
00:31:37,270 --> 00:31:38,350
Maybe later,

433
00:31:38,700 --> 00:31:40,900
when you develop a new divine medicine,

434
00:31:41,670 --> 00:31:42,730
they'll be useful.

435
00:31:50,210 --> 00:31:51,390
These scales

436
00:31:51,990 --> 00:31:53,270
are so hard and sharp.

437
00:31:55,920 --> 00:31:58,250
They could even be used as hidden weapons.

438
00:31:58,360 --> 00:31:59,980
There's something more powerful.

439
00:31:59,980 --> 00:32:00,670
Good stuff.

440
00:32:00,700 --> 00:32:02,970
I once saw a monster in the Wilderness

441
00:32:03,030 --> 00:32:04,670
called Henggong fish.

442
00:32:04,950 --> 00:32:06,830
Its scales are as hard as steel,

443
00:32:06,890 --> 00:32:08,350
impervious to blades and spears.

444
00:32:08,350 --> 00:32:09,270
Sounds like

445
00:32:09,430 --> 00:32:11,160
it would make excellent armor.

446
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:45,230
Its whole body is red,

447
00:32:45,340 --> 00:32:47,330
and its roar can shatter mountains and stone.

448
00:32:47,330 --> 00:32:48,400
Could it be...

449
00:32:48,620 --> 00:32:49,390
Zheng?

450
00:32:52,610 --> 00:32:54,030
What you're describing

451
00:32:54,320 --> 00:32:56,450
are all monsters from the Wilderness.

452
00:32:56,750 --> 00:32:58,160
But they are human.

453
00:32:58,180 --> 00:32:58,950
Are you insane?

454
00:32:58,950 --> 00:33:00,350
How could these be human?

455
00:33:08,790 --> 00:33:09,770
Zhu Yin,

456
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:12,030
why are you doing this?

457
00:33:13,800 --> 00:33:15,170
Because he and I

458
00:33:15,190 --> 00:33:16,850
share the same goal.

459
00:33:22,420 --> 00:33:23,490
Ying Zhao,

460
00:33:23,820 --> 00:33:25,440

461

These despicable tricks again.

462
00:33:53,690 --> 00:33:56,310
The number of times you can possess others is limited.

463
00:33:56,310 --> 00:33:57,330
Li Lun,

464
00:33:57,630 --> 00:34:00,710
you use forbidden arts so recklessly.

465
00:34:00,990 --> 00:34:02,670

466
00:34:02,870 --> 00:34:04,450

467
00:34:18,469 --> 00:34:19,270
Zhu Yin,

468
00:34:20,310 --> 00:34:22,040
you, a dignified Mountain God,

469
00:34:22,760 --> 00:34:26,420
have fallen so low as to conspire with Li Lun, like a pack of wolves.

470
00:34:27,389 --> 00:34:29,260
A pack of wolves?

471
00:34:31,510 --> 00:34:33,469
Now, you even use us demons

472
00:34:33,780 --> 00:34:35,659
as comparisons in insults.

473
00:34:36,070 --> 00:34:37,150
Good for you,

478
00:34:44,230 --> 00:34:45,830
you're the notorious great demon Zhu Yan,

479
00:34:45,830 --> 00:34:46,630
haven't you?

480
00:34:48,239 --> 00:34:49,989
Your goal is to

bring ruin to the Wilderness

482
00:34:52,980 --> 00:34:55,510
and lead all demons to their deaths, isn't it?

483
00:34:56,449 --> 00:34:57,820
You're wrong.

484
00:34:58,270 --> 00:35:00,740
It's to allow all living beings in the Wilderness

485

to freely travel between the two worlds,

00:36:29,130 --> 00:36:32,950
♫Rock and moss♫

519
00:36:29,670 --> 00:36:30,940
People say

520
00:36:31,070 --> 00:36:32,340
the Torch Dragon has great powers.

521
00:36:32,340 --> 00:36:33,350
It controls celestial phenomena

522
00:36:33,350 --> 00:36:34,620
and can move mountains and rivers with its breath.

523
00:36:33,720 --> 00:36:34,840
♫Are watching♫

524
00:36:34,900 --> 00:36:37,920
♫A lone boat drifts through the vast world, vanishing into mist♫

525
00:36:35,020 --> 00:36:36,210
Little scholar,

526
00:36:37,080 --> 00:36:38,330
while he may be powerful,

527
00:36:37,970 --> 00:36:40,960
♫Its sound fading away♫

528
00:36:38,360 --> 00:36:39,290
he can't control

529
00:36:39,300 --> 00:36:40,870
whether or not

530
00:36:40,920 --> 00:36:43,310
you achieve top honors in the imperial examination.

531
00:36:42,200 --> 00:36:43,050
♫I wish♫

532
00:36:43,130 --> 00:36:46,250
♫The sorrow of parting stayed beyond the river, and that we did not share the same mountain and moon♫

533
00:36:43,390 --> 00:36:45,150
I didn't ask Lord Torch Dragon

534
00:36:45,150 --> 00:36:46,650
to make me a Number One Scholar.

535
00:36:46,300 --> 00:36:50,120
♫Deep love, yet fate runs shallow♫

536
00:36:46,870 --> 00:36:48,070
Reading the classics

537
00:36:48,070 --> 00:36:50,170
is to broaden my horizons

538
00:36:50,200 --> 00:36:52,070
and avoid being narrow-minded or self-restrained.

539
00:36:52,070 --> 00:36:53,750
You're here as the temple keeper,

540
00:36:53,750 --> 00:36:54,880
trapped in one place

541
00:36:54,910 --> 00:36:56,110
day after day.

542
00:36:56,190 --> 00:36:57,850
You may not quite understand.

543
00:36:57,910 --> 00:36:58,750
You should

544
00:36:58,780 --> 00:37:00,430
go down the mountain more often.

545
00:37:00,430 --> 00:37:01,630
If you don't understand,

546
00:37:01,630 --> 00:37:03,040
you're welcome to visit me anytime.

547
00:37:03,040 --> 00:37:04,870
I live right at the foot of the mountain,

548
00:37:04,870 --> 00:37:07,470
in the house under the big tree on the west side.

549
00:37:19,470 --> 00:37:21,670
What did Li Lun offer you?

550
00:37:22,590 --> 00:37:24,190
There's no need for an offer.

551
00:37:25,760 --> 00:37:27,760
He and I share the same goal.

552
00:37:29,140 --> 00:37:30,800
Demons are demons.

553
00:37:32,150 --> 00:37:34,960
We will never be accepted by mortals.

554
00:37:36,600 --> 00:37:38,530
What did you add in the tea?

555
00:37:38,990 --> 00:37:40,710
Why did you harm me?

556
00:37:52,910 --> 00:37:54,120
Didn't you say

557
00:37:54,230 --> 00:37:55,290
that studying

558
00:37:55,350 --> 00:37:57,940
is to understand human affairs,

559
00:37:58,040 --> 00:37:59,320
broaden horizons,

560
00:37:59,400 --> 00:38:01,660
and recognize the vastness of the world,

561
00:38:01,680 --> 00:38:03,940
avoiding narrow-mindedness and self-restriction?

562
00:38:03,940 --> 00:38:05,550
But you're a demon.

563
00:38:14,590 --> 00:38:16,900
Why do you want recognition from them?

564
00:38:19,490 --> 00:38:21,210
Baize Goddess

565
00:38:21,730 --> 00:38:23,390
is just a mortal.

566
00:38:24,200 --> 00:38:27,110
On what basis can she set the rules for demons?

567
00:38:29,170 --> 00:38:30,330
Li Lun,

568
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:33,310
many demons yearn for the mortal world,

569
00:38:34,070 --> 00:38:36,060
but there are also many

570
00:38:36,200 --> 00:38:39,030
who prefer the eternal tranquility of the Wilderness,

571
00:38:39,030 --> 00:38:40,890
living in harmony with the world.

572
00:38:41,630 --> 00:38:43,970
So on what basis can you decide for them

573
00:38:44,960 --> 00:38:46,870
and destroy their homeland?

574
00:38:46,950 --> 00:38:49,560
That's because they are timid and cowardly,

575
00:38:50,080 --> 00:38:52,140
afraid to step into the mortal world.

576
00:38:53,840 --> 00:38:54,900
Zhu Yan,

577
00:38:56,570 --> 00:38:57,750
don't forget.

578
00:38:59,320 --> 00:39:02,660
It was you who led me out of the Wilderness,

579
00:39:05,430 --> 00:39:08,910
allowing me to see the vast world.
