00:15:16,360 --> 00:15:19,350
♫Sorrows scattered, lost to the wind♫

177
00:15:20,520 --> 00:15:24,440
♫Not forgetting, nor dwelling on♫

178
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:27,630
♫The way back home♫

179
00:15:28,330 --> 00:15:29,950

180
00:15:30,340 --> 00:15:33,850

♫Turning back♫

183

♫I find you still in that familiar place♫

184
00:15:43,090 --> 00:15:44,740
♫Waiting there♫

185
00:16:17,750 --> 00:16:18,310
Oh my.

186
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:20,720
A gift from Mr. Zhuo?

187
00:16:21,630 --> 00:16:23,360
The sun has risen from the west.

188
00:16:23,870 --> 00:16:26,110
And it's such a beautiful jade pendant.

189
00:16:27,190 --> 00:16:28,650
I don't like to owe favors.

190
00:16:28,890 --> 00:16:29,560
Oh?

191
00:16:31,020 --> 00:16:32,880
Which favor are you referring to?

192
00:16:33,030 --> 00:16:35,580
When I told you about Cheng Huang's formation,

193
00:16:35,580 --> 00:16:38,320
or when I taught you how to freeze water into ice?

194
00:16:38,340 --> 00:16:39,580
Perhaps,

195
00:16:39,630 --> 00:16:42,830
for when I taught you how to materialize your sword forms?

196
00:16:43,520 --> 00:16:45,680
You mortals have a saying.

197
00:16:46,150 --> 00:16:47,350
The closer you are,

198
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:48,870
the more you must settle the score.

199
00:16:48,870 --> 00:16:50,530
Don't push your luck.

200
00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:54,860
I will still kill you.

201
00:16:55,550 --> 00:16:56,590
I can't wait.

202
00:16:58,690 --> 00:17:00,880
Please keep your promise, Mr. Zhuo.

203
00:17:25,349 --> 00:17:26,390
Left, right.

204
00:17:26,410 --> 00:17:27,450
Left, right.

205
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:28,359
Left, right.

206
00:17:28,430 --> 00:17:29,510
Left, right.

207
00:17:30,580 --> 00:17:31,500
Sister.

208
00:17:31,750 --> 00:17:32,710
Hush.

209
00:17:33,080 --> 00:17:34,570
Don't say that word.

210
00:17:35,700 --> 00:17:36,500
Which word?

211
00:17:37,220 --> 00:17:38,790
I only said one word.

212
00:17:38,900 --> 00:17:39,590
Oh.

213
00:17:39,610 --> 00:17:40,420
Sister.

214
00:17:49,930 --> 00:17:51,980
According to the report,

215
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:53,540
three months ago...

216
00:17:53,560 --> 00:17:54,970
Three months ago,

217
00:17:56,170 --> 00:17:58,320
an identical case happened.

218
00:17:58,790 --> 00:18:00,410
The same method,

219
00:18:01,030 --> 00:18:02,970
and the same deer antler symbol.

220
00:18:03,350 --> 00:18:04,500
And the murderer

221
00:18:06,430 --> 00:18:08,330
was my brother, Pei Siheng.

222
00:18:08,420 --> 00:18:10,420
When you were on your demon-hunting mission,

223
00:18:10,420 --> 00:18:12,750
you shot and killed Pei Siheng on the spot.

224
00:18:13,750 --> 00:18:14,770
After that,

225
00:18:15,230 --> 00:18:17,630
you resigned as commander of Chongwu Camp.

226
00:18:17,650 --> 00:18:19,160
Why did you kill your brother?

227
00:18:19,160 --> 00:18:20,500
You could have just arrested him

228
00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:22,830
and sentenced him according to his crime.

229
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:26,470
Because he became a demon.

230
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:28,810
How could a human have become a demon?

231
00:18:28,810 --> 00:18:30,630
So what if he became a demon?

232
00:18:30,790 --> 00:18:32,590
Not all demons should be killed.

233
00:18:33,080 --> 00:18:34,480
How does that make sense?

234
00:18:49,870 --> 00:18:50,760
Sister.

235
00:18:59,540 --> 00:19:01,260
Are you here to kill me?

236
00:19:02,220 --> 00:19:03,650
You're evil.

237
00:19:04,750 --> 00:19:06,150
You are unforgivable.

238
00:19:07,180 --> 00:19:09,160
I'm indeed guilty.

239
00:19:09,310 --> 00:19:10,440
It's unforgivable.

240
00:19:11,270 --> 00:19:12,340
But Sister,

241
00:19:13,720 --> 00:19:15,270
can you forgive me?

242
00:19:16,710 --> 00:19:18,570
You must be able to understand me.

243
00:19:21,230 --> 00:19:23,070
Ms. Pei, if you can't do it,

244
00:19:23,230 --> 00:19:25,100
we'll kill him instead.

245
00:19:26,840 --> 00:19:27,630
Sister.

246
00:19:28,110 --> 00:19:29,300
Back then,

247
00:19:29,320 --> 00:19:30,380
I just wanted to...

248
00:20:04,740 --> 00:20:05,230
Bro...

249
00:20:05,670 --> 00:20:06,340
Brother.

250
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:07,680
Sister.

251
00:20:10,150 --> 00:20:12,680
Back then, you turned and left just like that.

252
00:20:16,100 --> 00:20:17,620
You didn't hear

253
00:20:19,780 --> 00:20:21,510
my last words for you.

254
00:20:34,590 --> 00:20:35,390
Sister.

255
00:20:36,890 --> 00:20:38,360
Now that I'm dead,

256
00:20:39,540 --> 00:20:42,100
I can't do anything for you anymore.

257
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:50,780
This case is so strange.

258
00:20:50,810 --> 00:20:52,600
Have you ever suspected it?

259
00:20:53,030 --> 00:20:54,150
Of course.

260
00:21:01,160 --> 00:21:03,020
We examined the body three times.

261
00:21:03,870 --> 00:21:05,530
He was confirmed to be a demon.

262
00:21:06,760 --> 00:21:08,220
No other result was found.

263
00:21:08,840 --> 00:21:10,750
What did you do with the body?

264
00:21:12,580 --> 00:21:13,710
I followed the rules

265
00:21:14,750 --> 00:21:15,550
and burned it.

266
00:21:21,160 --> 00:21:23,990
What about your brother we saw today?

267
00:21:24,850 --> 00:21:26,360
Did he come back alive?

268
00:21:28,540 --> 00:21:29,740
He came back to life?

269
00:21:31,880 --> 00:21:34,540
I don't believe there is such magic in the world.

270
00:21:35,580 --> 00:21:37,830
He wasn't suddenly resurrected today.

271
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:41,750
The one who sent this case file

272
00:21:43,290 --> 00:21:45,090
was my brother.

273
00:21:56,360 --> 00:21:58,320
Why did he give you this file?

274
00:22:01,150 --> 00:22:02,950
He must have been wronged.

275
00:22:03,790 --> 00:22:06,140
He wants you to clear his name.

276
00:22:07,480 --> 00:22:08,290
No.

277
00:22:10,230 --> 00:22:12,370
His gaze wanted me to know that

278
00:22:13,940 --> 00:22:14,850
he hates me

279
00:22:16,590 --> 00:22:17,840
and wants to kill me.

280
00:22:18,850 --> 00:22:20,400
He wants me to suffer.

281
00:22:22,410 --> 00:22:23,400
That's wrong.

282
00:22:24,620 --> 00:22:25,750
I smell

283
00:22:26,360 --> 00:22:27,710
a conspiracy.

284
00:22:30,100 --> 00:22:32,600
He has a huge connection with Cheng Huang.

285
00:22:33,020 --> 00:22:34,280
If we find Cheng Huang,

286
00:22:34,760 --> 00:22:35,890
there will be clues.

287
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:38,200
Why are you looking at me?

288
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:40,540
How would I know where Cheng Huang is?

289
00:22:40,840 --> 00:22:42,570
When we were looking for Ran Yi,

290
00:22:42,910 --> 00:22:44,240
you said the same thing.

291
00:22:48,360 --> 00:22:51,060
It's so hard to fool you now, Mr. Zhuo.

292
00:22:56,830 --> 00:22:58,420
Cheng Huang's formation

293
00:22:56,940 --> 00:23:01,750
[Pear Garden] [Ming Palace]

294
00:22:58,440 --> 00:23:00,020
uses living people as a medium

295
00:23:00,020 --> 00:23:01,650
to absorb the power of life.

296
00:23:01,950 --> 00:23:04,510
And the place where the power ultimately gathers

297
00:23:04,510 --> 00:23:05,840
is the eye of formation.

298
00:23:08,620 --> 00:23:09,750
Cheng Huang is here.

299
00:23:10,270 --> 00:23:12,280
[Map of Tiandu]

300
00:23:12,670 --> 00:23:13,950
The observatory?

301
00:23:22,220 --> 00:23:24,080
When the Baize Token went missing

302
00:23:24,270 --> 00:23:26,070
and the goddess' seat was empty,

303
00:23:26,190 --> 00:23:28,720
the one who forcefully opened the Kunlun Gate

304
00:23:28,940 --> 00:23:32,100
and caused the demons to escape to the mortal world

305
00:23:34,790 --> 00:23:36,230
was Cheng Huang.

306
00:23:45,130 --> 00:23:47,770
Cheng Huang committed a grave crime back then

307
00:23:48,270 --> 00:23:50,930
and killed countless demons of the Wilderness.

308
00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:57,280
But somehow, he escaped the punishment of the Baize Token

309
00:23:57,350 --> 00:23:58,950
and fled to the mortal world.

310
00:24:00,150 --> 00:24:02,010
I don't know what he is

311
00:24:02,620 --> 00:24:04,810
plotting in secret.

312
00:24:43,270 --> 00:24:44,000
It's so high.

313
00:24:49,040 --> 00:24:50,840
This sundial looks familiar.

314
00:24:53,270 --> 00:24:55,400
Something's wrong with this sundial.

315
00:24:55,640 --> 00:24:57,240
It's not for measuring time.

316
00:24:57,900 --> 00:24:58,660
What?

317
00:24:59,630 --> 00:25:01,760
The sundial can be used to measure time,

318
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:04,430
but it can only do so when there is sunlight.

319
00:25:04,540 --> 00:25:06,270
If it's used for measuring time at night,

320
00:25:06,270 --> 00:25:08,200
it'll need the help of a water bell.

321
00:25:08,770 --> 00:25:10,500
But there's only a sundial here

322
00:25:10,730 --> 00:25:12,260
and no water bell.

323
00:25:13,920 --> 00:25:15,310
Then this sundial is...

324
00:25:15,310 --> 00:25:16,350
It's an entrance.

325
00:25:16,810 --> 00:25:18,780
Cheng Huang is guarding the eye of the formation.

326
00:25:18,780 --> 00:25:19,810
This sundial

327
00:25:19,850 --> 00:25:22,380
is used to connect to the eye of the formation.

328
00:25:25,430 --> 00:25:26,760
We can't barge in.

329
00:25:32,900 --> 00:25:35,300
Cheng Huang has lived for too long.

330
00:25:35,380 --> 00:25:36,270
He has a weird temper

331
00:25:36,270 --> 00:25:37,640
and a lot of malicious energy.

332
00:25:37,640 --> 00:25:39,590
It's hard for us to defend ourselves

333
00:25:39,590 --> 00:25:40,950
in his territory.

334
00:25:40,970 --> 00:25:42,350
Stop showing off your knowledge.

335
00:25:42,350 --> 00:25:43,430
Tell us what to do.

336
00:25:45,220 --> 00:25:48,350
Don't you love helping others tie the knot, Ms. Wen Xiao?

337
00:25:49,070 --> 00:25:51,030
Please tie a knot for us.

338
00:25:51,060 --> 00:25:52,480
For the two of us?

339
00:25:54,590 --> 00:25:55,380
Ridiculous.

340
00:25:55,920 --> 00:25:56,910
I mean,

341
00:25:56,940 --> 00:25:58,910
use the Demon Binding Rope to divide us into two teams

342
00:25:58,910 --> 00:25:59,840
and tie us together

343
00:25:59,840 --> 00:26:01,830
to prevent us from being separated and lost.

344
00:26:01,830 --> 00:26:03,450
Especially those

345
00:26:03,750 --> 00:26:05,220
young friends.

346
00:26:05,430 --> 00:26:08,230
-He's talking about you.
-He's talking about you.

347
00:26:26,160 --> 00:26:28,550
I really want to tie it around your neck instead.

348
00:26:28,550 --> 00:26:29,760
I'm sorry.

349
00:26:29,790 --> 00:26:31,100
I'm not a dog demon.

350
00:26:31,560 --> 00:26:33,310
I like walking monkeys anyway.

351
00:26:38,840 --> 00:26:39,810
Yinglei.

352
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:40,920
You stay here

353
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:42,260
and don't let anyone come close.

354
00:26:42,260 --> 00:26:43,130
Huh?

355
00:27:00,800 --> 00:27:01,840
Wow.

356
00:27:06,780 --> 00:27:07,350
Eh?

357
00:27:07,370 --> 00:27:08,770
They left just like that?

358
00:27:09,860 --> 00:27:10,660
Bai Jiu.

359
00:27:10,780 --> 00:27:11,580
Then...

360
00:27:18,740 --> 00:27:19,690
Then I...

361
00:27:20,790 --> 00:27:22,450
How should I guard this place?

362
00:28:06,330 --> 00:28:07,760
Jiu.

363
00:28:09,930 --> 00:28:10,740
Sister Pei.

364
00:28:11,230 --> 00:28:12,270
Where is this place, Sister Pei?

365
00:28:12,270 --> 00:28:12,930
Sister Pei.

366
00:28:15,790 --> 00:28:16,580
Sister Pei?

367
00:28:17,300 --> 00:28:18,030
Sister Pei?

368
00:28:18,900 --> 00:28:20,160
Where is this?

369
00:28:21,320 --> 00:28:22,690
Sister Pei.

370
00:28:22,930 --> 00:28:24,390
What's wrong, Sister Pei?

371
00:28:24,560 --> 00:28:25,560
Sister Pei.

372
00:28:46,390 --> 00:28:47,500
Heng.

373
00:29:51,180 --> 00:29:53,840
Why did we suddenly come to Tianxiang Pavilion?

374
00:29:55,060 --> 00:29:57,070
Turns out the ever-so-serious Mr. Zhuo

375
00:29:57,070 --> 00:29:58,820
would come to such a place too.

376
00:29:58,850 --> 00:29:59,510
You...

377
00:30:03,410 --> 00:30:05,810
I came here when I was investigating a case.

378
00:30:06,830 --> 00:30:07,900
Just once.

379
00:30:08,470 --> 00:30:09,080
Oh.

380
00:30:09,160 --> 00:30:09,770
You...

381
00:30:11,900 --> 00:30:14,270
This is not the real Tianxiang Pavilion.

382
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:17,690
It's an illusion Cheng Huang created with magic.

383
00:30:19,480 --> 00:30:20,610
I see.

384
00:30:20,950 --> 00:30:22,350
It's like Ran Yi's dream.

385
00:30:24,630 --> 00:30:26,560
It's way more dangerous than that.

386
00:30:29,670 --> 00:30:31,740
This is someone's memory.

387
00:30:33,040 --> 00:30:33,910
Whose?

388
00:30:40,210 --> 00:30:41,410
I guess it's hers.

389
00:31:06,330 --> 00:31:07,790
Let's split up.

390
00:31:19,330 --> 00:31:20,560
Whose idea was this?

391
00:31:21,460 --> 00:31:22,250
-His.
-Hers.

392
00:31:27,040 --> 00:31:28,810
Why are you complaining?

393
00:31:28,970 --> 00:31:30,460
You got two of us.

394
00:31:30,750 --> 00:31:33,650
Standing between two handsome men.

395
00:31:33,680 --> 00:31:35,410
Aren't you happy?

396
00:31:36,140 --> 00:31:38,560
You're the one standing between both of us.

397
00:31:38,930 --> 00:31:40,020
You shameless guy.

398
00:31:47,400 --> 00:31:48,430
You two have fun.

399
00:31:49,300 --> 00:31:49,750
Hey...

400
00:31:51,860 --> 00:31:53,870
One moment ago we were companions.

401
00:31:53,890 --> 00:31:56,020
The next, he's as cold as a stranger.

402
00:31:57,430 --> 00:31:59,030
You're much better than him.

403
00:31:59,960 --> 00:32:01,380
Time for a walk.

404
00:32:01,630 --> 00:32:02,160
Let's go.

405
00:32:10,760 --> 00:32:11,560
Sister.

406
00:32:14,930 --> 00:32:16,160
Why are you here?

407
00:32:16,770 --> 00:32:18,250
What are you doing here?

408
00:32:22,620 --> 00:32:24,150
You joined the Chongwu Camp

409
00:32:24,520 --> 00:32:26,070
without telling me?

410
00:32:28,590 --> 00:32:30,550
Why can't I join Chongwu Camp?

411
00:32:31,400 --> 00:32:33,760
The Pei family has been hunting demons for generations.

412
00:32:33,760 --> 00:32:35,420
I am the only son of our family.

413
00:32:35,910 --> 00:32:38,040
I should inherit the family business.

414
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:40,310
But Father and Grandpa only value you.

415
00:32:40,310 --> 00:32:42,040
They don't care about me at all.

416
00:32:44,110 --> 00:32:46,190
They even gave you the family's treasured bow

417
00:32:46,190 --> 00:32:47,030
to you.

418
00:33:00,830 --> 00:33:01,640
Heng.

419
00:33:01,740 --> 00:33:02,790
Heng!

420
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:06,130
Don't be so willful.

421
00:33:06,990 --> 00:33:08,390
Look at your health.

422
00:33:08,970 --> 00:33:10,180
You are weak

423
00:33:10,500 --> 00:33:11,760
and feeble.

424
00:33:12,030 --> 00:33:13,220
How can you join the army?

425
00:33:13,220 --> 00:33:14,630
How can you catch demons?

426
00:33:14,860 --> 00:33:16,330
Do you want to die?

427
00:33:18,710 --> 00:33:19,350
Yes.

428
00:33:19,950 --> 00:33:21,230
You all look down on me.

429
00:33:22,870 --> 00:33:25,670
You think I can't achieve my goal because I'm sick.

430
00:33:27,060 --> 00:33:29,160
I want to prove to all of you that

431
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:31,510
I can also join the army to hunt demons!

432
00:33:31,510 --> 00:33:32,670
Don't be willful.

433
00:33:37,400 --> 00:33:38,960
I promised Father

434
00:33:39,890 --> 00:33:41,520
to take good care of you.

435
00:33:43,160 --> 00:33:44,870
I did all this

436
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:47,490
for you.

437
00:33:47,520 --> 00:33:48,030
Can you...

438
00:33:48,030 --> 00:33:48,730
For me?

439
00:33:53,700 --> 00:33:55,480
You did it for yourself.

440
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:02,430
Since young,

441
00:34:04,950 --> 00:34:06,150
have you ever asked me

442
00:34:08,560 --> 00:34:10,110
what I want the most?

443
00:34:13,239 --> 00:34:14,040
Sister.

444
00:34:15,830 --> 00:34:17,830
Since I started to remember things,

445
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:22,280
people around me kept saying that to me.

446
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:25,510
"For you."

447
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:28,120
"For you."

448
00:34:30,150 --> 00:34:30,989
"For you."

449
00:34:37,310 --> 00:34:38,500
This sentence

450
00:34:40,520 --> 00:34:41,620
is like a shackle

451
00:34:41,620 --> 00:34:44,230
I've been wearing since I was a kid.

Sister Pei.

494

Why did you space out for so long?

495
00:36:56,230 --> 00:36:57,890
Why is there a doll over there?

496
00:36:59,670 --> 00:37:00,730
Let's check it out.

497
00:37:19,250 --> 00:37:20,330
Sister.

498
00:37:23,520 --> 00:37:25,060
Do you want to know

499
00:37:25,960 --> 00:37:27,840
why I became a demon?

500
00:37:28,210 --> 00:37:29,200
I don't know.

501
00:37:31,030 --> 00:37:33,250
You never told me.

502
00:37:34,900 --> 00:37:36,130
Sister Pei,

503
00:37:36,190 --> 00:37:37,670
are you talking to me?

504
00:37:42,080 --> 00:37:44,800
This doll looks scary.

505
00:37:45,980 --> 00:37:47,730
This doll said

506
00:37:48,810 --> 00:37:51,730
he knew why my brother became a demon.

507
00:37:51,950 --> 00:37:52,990
Was it talking?

508
00:37:53,580 --> 00:37:54,860
Why didn't I hear it?

509
00:38:21,110 --> 00:38:22,270
Sister Pei?

510
00:38:22,480 --> 00:38:23,710
Sister Pei!

511
00:38:23,950 --> 00:38:25,150
Sister Pei, where are you?

512
00:38:25,150 --> 00:38:25,930
Sister Pei.

513
00:38:27,570 --> 00:38:30,060

00:39:11,550 --> 00:39:12,510
Mr. Zhuo.

520
00:39:12,740 --> 00:39:13,870
What a coincidence.

521
00:39:44,310 --> 00:39:45,980
The dancing girl

522
00:39:46,010 --> 00:39:46,940
is missing.

523
00:39:49,470 --> 00:39:50,470
She's over there.

524
00:40:05,040 --> 00:40:07,610
She aged so much so quickly.

525
00:40:11,430 --> 00:40:12,550
Did she?

526
00:40:15,440 --> 00:40:18,120
You men don't understand at all.

527
00:40:18,480 --> 00:40:19,630
Zhi Mei missed

528
00:40:19,660 --> 00:40:21,030
her blooming window.

529
00:40:21,250 --> 00:40:23,080
She was obsessed with the stage and dance

530
00:40:23,080 --> 00:40:24,870
and couldn't find a good time to get married.

531
00:40:24,870 --> 00:40:25,790
Great.

532
00:40:25,810 --> 00:40:27,760
No one is interested in her anymore.

533
00:40:27,760 --> 00:40:28,630
Now,

534
00:40:28,650 --> 00:40:30,830
the peony is blooming beautifully.

535
00:40:30,830 --> 00:40:33,080
Spring flowers don't know how cold snow is.

536
00:40:33,080 --> 00:40:35,510
The plum blossoms don't know the heat of summer.

537
00:40:35,510 --> 00:40:37,040
Each flower has its admirer

538
00:40:37,390 --> 00:40:38,590
and its own beauty.

539
00:40:39,470 --> 00:40:41,070
Why compare with each other?

540
00:40:43,910 --> 00:40:45,430
Zhi Mei, Zhi Mei.

541
00:40:47,420 --> 00:40:51,150
She must be obsessed with the plum blossoms's pride and aloofness.

542
00:40:51,530 --> 00:40:52,930
She enjoys her own beauty

543
00:40:54,240 --> 00:40:55,480
and isn't confined by

544
00:40:55,510 --> 00:40:57,720
the blooming window others speak of.

545
00:41:01,400 --> 00:41:03,160
Please show mercy

546
00:41:03,610 --> 00:41:05,490
and let me be beautiful forever,

547
00:41:05,910 --> 00:41:07,440
even prettier than before.

548
00:41:07,670 --> 00:41:09,800
Let me become the top courtesan again.

549
00:41:26,110 --> 00:41:27,860
Is he Cheng Huang?

550
00:41:36,130 --> 00:41:37,360
I get it now.

551
00:41:38,010 --> 00:41:39,620
Cheng Huang looks for

552
00:41:39,860 --> 00:41:41,920
people with obsessions in this world

553
00:41:42,040 --> 00:41:44,360
and grants their wishes.

554
00:41:44,390 --> 00:41:46,480
As long as they say yes...

555
00:41:47,010 --> 00:41:49,060
He'll make them a doll.

556
00:42:21,080 --> 00:42:22,240
See anything you like,

557
00:42:22,240 --> 00:42:22,920
Miss?

558
00:42:30,570 --> 00:42:31,590
These dolls...

559
00:42:31,590 --> 00:42:32,630
These dolls

560
00:42:33,080 --> 00:42:34,670
are not entirely dolls.

561
00:42:36,470 --> 00:42:38,070
Just like dolls,

562
00:42:38,310 --> 00:42:39,570
they are neither alive

563
00:42:39,940 --> 00:42:41,140
nor dead.

564
00:42:42,060 --> 00:42:43,140
When their bodies are broken,

565
00:42:43,140 --> 00:42:44,310
they can be fixed.

566
00:42:45,510 --> 00:42:47,410
But just like humans,

567
00:42:48,440 --> 00:42:49,570
they have memories.

568
00:42:50,020 --> 00:42:51,380
They can feel joy

569
00:42:51,550 --> 00:42:52,670
and sadness.

570
00:42:53,730 --> 00:42:55,040
So,

571
00:42:55,070 --> 00:42:56,780
they are dolls,

572
00:42:58,000 --> 00:42:59,600
but also not entirely dolls.

573
00:43:06,510 --> 00:43:08,240
I know who you are.

574
00:43:08,720 --> 00:43:09,350
Oh?

575
00:43:11,050 --> 00:43:12,470
You're Cheng Huang.

576
00:43:17,940 --> 00:43:20,610
Why did you turn Heng into a demon?

577
00:43:23,250 --> 00:43:24,420
It wasn't me.

578
00:43:25,790 --> 00:43:27,120
He did it himself.

579
00:43:28,160 --> 00:43:30,720
I just heard his wish

580
00:43:31,300 --> 00:43:33,130
and realized it for him.

581
00:43:34,110 --> 00:43:35,070
Wish?

582
00:43:35,550 --> 00:43:37,100
That's because

583
00:43:37,470 --> 00:43:39,190
you're too outstanding.

584
00:43:43,950 --> 00:43:45,480
You're superior,

585
00:43:47,160 --> 00:43:49,590
so you've never heard my wish.

586
00:43:50,520 --> 00:43:51,760
You have probably

587
00:43:51,940 --> 00:43:53,380
never heard of it.

588
00:43:57,190 --> 00:43:58,920
Wherever I go,

589
00:43:59,800 --> 00:44:01,240
I listen to

590
00:44:01,590 --> 00:44:03,570
the people's wishes.

591
00:44:05,780 --> 00:44:07,760
Then, I choose one

592
00:44:08,080 --> 00:44:10,060
with the strongest obsession

593
00:44:11,790 --> 00:44:13,330
to realize his wish.

594
00:44:15,390 --> 00:44:17,480
Your brother's obsession

595
00:44:17,550 --> 00:44:19,150
is far beyond everyone else.

596
00:44:21,320 --> 00:44:23,000
Do you want to know what it is?

597
00:44:27,920 --> 00:44:29,340
I know.

598
00:44:32,050 --> 00:44:33,600
He wants to be stronger.

599
00:44:36,200 --> 00:44:37,740
He wants to surpass me

600
00:44:39,040 --> 00:44:40,490
and replace me.

601
00:44:42,270 --> 00:44:43,710
He wants to take from me

602
00:44:45,110 --> 00:44:47,760
what originally belonged to him.

603
00:44:51,160 --> 00:44:52,260
How unfortunate.

604
00:44:53,630 --> 00:44:55,660
The mortal eyes

605
00:44:56,010 --> 00:44:58,480
can see mountains and rivers,

606
00:44:59,300 --> 00:45:01,900
but cannot see clearly the people around them.

607
00:45:02,460 --> 00:45:03,580
Although

608
00:45:04,110 --> 00:45:05,860
you're close siblings,

609
00:45:07,210 --> 00:45:09,240
you failed to see clearly

610
00:45:10,960 --> 00:45:13,290
what he really wanted.

611
00:46:03,710 --> 00:46:05,970
Do you dislike practicing martial arts?

612
00:46:07,190 --> 00:46:08,300
Yes.

613
00:46:19,140 --> 00:46:21,050
But I have to become stronger

614
00:46:21,830 --> 00:46:23,430
to protect you.

615
00:46:37,140 --> 00:46:37,870
Sister.

616
00:46:50,690 --> 00:46:51,640
Look.

617
00:46:59,100 --> 00:47:00,910
Although the dress is beautiful,

618
00:47:00,910 --> 00:47:02,570
it's inconvenient to move in.

619
00:47:05,970 --> 00:47:07,470
It doesn't suit me.

620
00:47:37,150 --> 00:47:38,270
What's wrong?

621
00:47:39,510 --> 00:47:40,860
Are you disappointed?

622
00:47:43,260 --> 00:47:45,420
I can grant your wish.
