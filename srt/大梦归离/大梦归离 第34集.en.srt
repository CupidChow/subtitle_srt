♫Snowflakes on the corners of its eyes♫

♫The rain wet its feathers♫

♫Only I know its story♫

34
00:06:14,070 --> 00:06:15,030
Brother Zhuo.

35
00:06:17,070 --> 00:06:19,000
Do you think Ying Lei will blame me?

36
00:06:19,230 --> 00:06:20,150
Of course not.

37
00:06:21,510 --> 00:06:22,920
He did it to protect you.

38
00:06:24,870 --> 00:06:26,070
One day,

39
00:06:27,190 --> 00:06:29,720
there will be someone you want to protect too.

40
00:06:34,060 --> 00:06:36,260
Why do you always hold my bell?

41
00:06:36,670 --> 00:06:38,270
Because when I hold the bell,

42
00:06:39,130 --> 00:06:42,380
I feel like you're right beside me.

43
00:06:42,550 --> 00:06:45,150
That way, no matter how scary the road ahead is,

44
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:47,360
I'm brave enough to move forward.

Dad.

79
00:09:42,630 --> 00:09:43,510
Dad?

80
00:09:44,150 --> 00:09:44,950
Dad!

81
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:46,280
Wake up!

82
00:09:46,520 --> 00:09:47,310

Dad.

91
00:10:46,540 --> 00:10:48,190
It's good that you woke up.

92
00:10:50,830 --> 00:10:52,520
How did I wake up?

93
00:11:00,510 --> 00:11:02,130
It's Baize Divine Power.

94
00:11:03,380 --> 00:11:04,820
The power of Baize,

95
00:11:05,430 --> 00:11:07,010
with water as its essence,

96
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:09,150
can purify all things in the world.

97
00:11:14,910 --> 00:11:15,510
Dad?

98
00:11:15,990 --> 00:11:16,810
Dad?

99
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:19,240
What's wrong?

100
00:11:20,700 --> 00:11:22,820
Once the inner core enters the body,

101
00:11:23,350 --> 00:11:25,030
it can't be reversed.

102
00:11:25,260 --> 00:11:25,750
Dad,

103
00:11:25,750 --> 00:11:26,810
that won't happen.

104
00:11:28,030 --> 00:11:29,150
Xiao.

105
00:11:29,150 --> 00:11:30,680
I will definitely save you.

106
00:11:32,550 --> 00:11:34,170
I can't turn back.

107
00:11:36,270 --> 00:11:37,900
Go and save those people.

108
00:11:39,260 --> 00:11:40,660
Before...

109
00:11:41,910 --> 00:11:43,110
the demon core in their bodies

110
00:11:43,110 --> 00:11:44,660
takes root completely.

111
00:11:47,670 --> 00:11:48,930

112
00:11:48,950 --> 00:11:49,440

Dad!

115
00:11:52,350 --> 00:11:53,910
I promised you...

116
00:11:54,020 --> 00:11:55,350
It seems that in this life,

117
00:11:55,350 --> 00:11:56,750
you'll have to keep watching over

118
00:11:56,750 --> 00:11:58,880
your troublesome daughter every day.

119
00:11:59,230 --> 00:12:00,310
Yes.

120
00:12:01,150 --> 00:12:02,310
In this life,

121
00:12:02,840 --> 00:12:04,290
I can never leave you.

122
00:12:05,180 --> 00:12:06,590
I promised...

123
00:12:08,550 --> 00:12:09,270
Dad.

124
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:12,900
I would never leave you.

125
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:20,310
But now, I can't do that.

126

127

From now on,

128
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:37,750
someone will...

129
00:12:37,850 --> 00:12:38,900
continue...

130
00:12:39,060 --> 00:12:40,970

131
00:12:42,990 --> 00:12:44,120

The entire city's people

152

are turning into demonized humans.

153

Yes.

154
00:15:00,520 --> 00:15:01,760
My tears

155
00:15:03,670 --> 00:15:04,870
can turn the demonized humans

156
00:15:04,870 --> 00:15:06,160
back to normal.

157
00:15:07,450 --> 00:15:08,070
As long as

158
00:15:08,070 --> 00:15:10,510
I release Baize Divine Power within me

159
00:15:11,490 --> 00:15:13,060
and transform it into rain,

160
00:15:14,350 --> 00:15:16,730
everyone will be saved.

161
00:15:18,340 --> 00:15:19,870
My master taught me this.

162
00:15:20,670 --> 00:15:22,840
This is the final sacrificial spell

163
00:15:24,420 --> 00:15:26,500
of Baize Goddesses:

164
00:15:29,340 --> 00:15:30,660
Guili.

165
00:15:35,540 --> 00:15:37,250
Without Baize Divine Power,

166
00:15:37,830 --> 00:15:39,130
you will die.

167
00:15:42,350 --> 00:15:44,110
I'm already poisoned

168
00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:46,980
and don't have much time left.

169
00:15:51,030 --> 00:15:52,910
Isn't this a better way to die?

170
00:15:56,030 --> 00:15:57,790
I have a better way.

171
00:16:13,270 --> 00:16:15,100
The love token I promised you.

172
00:16:15,510 --> 00:16:17,210
You must keep it safe.

173
00:16:37,490 --> 00:16:39,550
I carved it myself.

174
00:16:41,260 --> 00:16:42,770
It's the only one

175
00:16:43,470 --> 00:16:44,740
in this vast world.

176
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:47,680
If you lose it,

177
00:16:50,630 --> 00:16:52,470
there won't be another.

178
00:17:00,990 --> 00:17:02,060
Wear it,

179
00:17:03,750 --> 00:17:05,829
and think of it as me being with you.

180
00:17:08,750 --> 00:17:09,609
Zhao Yuanzhou,

181
00:17:10,930 --> 00:17:12,310
what are you doing?

182
00:17:24,780 --> 00:17:27,910
Do you know what the source of the Baize Order's power is?

183
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,690
I heard from my master

184
00:17:31,430 --> 00:17:33,000
that Baize Divine Power

185
00:17:33,310 --> 00:17:34,510
has no source;

186
00:17:35,470 --> 00:17:36,830
it is a cycle.

187
00:17:40,030 --> 00:17:42,760
The reason Baize Divine Power is a cyclical force

188
00:17:43,790 --> 00:17:46,070
is because it actually comes from malicious energy.

189
00:17:46,070 --> 00:17:48,390
Baize Divine Power is the force of heaven and earth's cycles,

190
00:17:48,390 --> 00:17:49,910
protecting the Wilderness

191
00:17:49,910 --> 00:17:51,950
and counteracting the malicious energy.

192
00:17:51,950 --> 00:17:53,710
Without you,

193
00:17:53,910 --> 00:17:56,440
how could this malicious energy be gathered?

194
00:17:56,590 --> 00:17:58,070
And how could the power of Baize

195
00:17:58,070 --> 00:17:59,470
continue to cycle?

196
00:18:00,910 --> 00:18:01,910
Am I...

197
00:18:04,510 --> 00:18:06,970
also a part of the cycles of heaven and earth?

198
00:18:10,070 --> 00:18:12,200
The stronger the malicious energy is,

199
00:18:12,330 --> 00:18:14,590
the stronger the power of Baize becomes.

200
00:18:16,790 --> 00:18:17,790
No.

201
00:18:19,350 --> 00:18:20,310
No!

202
00:18:24,680 --> 00:18:28,140
In the realm of illusions of the Bingyi Clan's forbidden area,

203
00:18:28,350 --> 00:18:30,600
the future Ying Long foresaw

204
00:18:31,070 --> 00:18:34,000
is that I ultimately die under the Cloud Light Sword,

205
00:18:36,500 --> 00:18:41,090
♫The flower in my palm♫

206
00:18:37,230 --> 00:18:38,550
using my body

207
00:18:38,630 --> 00:18:41,560
to trigger the power of the Baize Order to cycle once again.

208
00:18:41,410 --> 00:18:46,620
♫Is everchanging♫

209
00:18:43,020 --> 00:18:45,590
This is the most powerful force in this world.

210
00:18:45,590 --> 00:18:46,450
No.

211
00:18:46,910 --> 00:18:51,720
♫Sand slips through fingertips♫

212
00:18:49,190 --> 00:18:51,530
This is what Baize Goddess should do,

213
00:18:52,470 --> 00:18:57,280
♫Struggling again and again♫

214
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:54,120
not you.

215
00:18:58,270 --> 00:19:03,050
♫The sea of suffering has no end♫

216
00:19:03,990 --> 00:19:08,060
♫The spring breeze asks him♫

217
00:19:05,180 --> 00:19:06,600
I told you

218
00:19:07,900 --> 00:19:09,840
I would make sure you live.

219
00:19:08,100 --> 00:19:13,830
♫What troubles turned his hair white♫

220
00:19:22,850 --> 00:19:23,930
Tie.

221
00:19:35,310 --> 00:19:36,420
Zhao Yuanzhou,

222
00:19:36,450 --> 00:19:38,020
I forbid you to do this!

223
00:19:38,040 --> 00:19:39,150
Zhao Yuanzhou!

224
00:19:43,390 --> 00:19:44,220
Zhao Yuanzhou.

225
00:19:44,220 --> 00:19:45,080
Zhao Yuanzhou!

226
00:19:45,100 --> 00:19:45,960
Zhao Yuanzhou!

227
00:19:50,650 --> 00:19:51,840
Let go of me.

228
00:19:52,120 --> 00:19:53,220
Zhao Yuanzhou,

229
00:19:53,370 --> 00:19:54,560
what are you doing?

230
00:19:54,670 --> 00:19:56,060
Let go of me!

231
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:57,880
Let go of me!

232
00:19:58,200 --> 00:19:59,130
Let go of me!

233
00:20:00,270 --> 00:20:03,020
♫One light, one fire, one crescent moon♫

234
00:20:03,290 --> 00:20:05,660
♫The vow of life and death♫

235
00:20:05,980 --> 00:20:11,140
♫Yet tears leave without a goodbye♫

236
00:20:10,280 --> 00:20:11,670
Zhao Yuanzhou!

237
00:20:11,490 --> 00:20:14,150
♫No need to borrow strong wine; it's in my heart♫

238
00:20:14,420 --> 00:20:16,810
♫The dark hair doesn't turn white like snow♫

239
00:20:15,420 --> 00:20:16,960
Zhao Yuanzhou!

240
00:20:16,910 --> 00:20:22,090
♫Some other time, let's watch the setting sun again♫

241
00:20:22,740 --> 00:20:25,300
♫A lone boat drifts through the world♫

242
00:20:23,970 --> 00:20:24,950
Zhao Yuanzhou,

243
00:20:24,950 --> 00:20:26,110
let go of me!

244
00:20:25,370 --> 00:20:27,970
♫The heart feels bitter, then sweet♫

245
00:20:28,280 --> 00:20:33,330
♫Can't distinguish night from day♫

246
00:20:30,130 --> 00:20:31,410
Zhao Yuanzhou!

247
00:20:33,960 --> 00:20:36,710
♫The world echoes with a single sigh♫

248
00:20:36,750 --> 00:20:39,290
♫Love and hate each fills half the heart♫

249
00:20:39,530 --> 00:20:40,580
♫Don't forget♫

250
00:20:40,890 --> 00:20:44,760
♫The unforgotten past♫

251
00:20:44,840 --> 00:20:49,880
♫Who misses the youth gazing at the bitter sea♫

252
00:20:50,300 --> 00:20:55,510
♫He shouted and wanted to be heard by the world♫

253
00:20:56,300 --> 00:20:58,810
♫The cruel debts of fate♫

254
00:20:59,020 --> 00:21:01,460
♫Are exchanged for the phrase "I'm willing"♫

255
00:21:01,820 --> 00:21:03,060
♫Wind blows in the distance♫

256
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:06,910
♫The distant boat approaches the shore♫

257
00:22:13,470 --> 00:22:14,350
Don't cry.

258
00:22:16,070 --> 00:22:17,500
Pull yourself together.

259
00:22:18,440 --> 00:22:20,790
You have more important things to do.

260
00:22:25,790 --> 00:22:27,230
Do you know why

261
00:22:28,220 --> 00:22:30,710
my One-Word Spell "Yi" worked on you

262
00:22:31,510 --> 00:22:34,050
but didn't work when breaking

263
00:22:34,970 --> 00:22:36,570
Wen Zongyu's barrier later?

264
00:22:37,070 --> 00:22:37,880
Why?

265
00:22:40,510 --> 00:22:42,760
Because I only gave you the ability

266
00:22:43,550 --> 00:22:45,700
to be immune to my One-Word Spell.

267
00:22:46,520 --> 00:22:49,580
At that time, you had Li Lun's demonic power inside you.

268
00:22:50,280 --> 00:22:52,740
The One-Word Spell recognized you as Li Lun,

269
00:22:53,790 --> 00:22:55,160
so it took effect.

270
00:22:57,310 --> 00:22:58,910
When you gave me both Li Lun's

271
00:23:00,210 --> 00:23:02,880
and your demonic power,

272
00:23:04,510 --> 00:23:07,110
my spell recognized that you were Zhuo Yichen.

273
00:23:08,360 --> 00:23:09,150
See?

274
00:23:11,270 --> 00:23:13,180
Li Lun always wanted to kill you,

275
00:23:15,130 --> 00:23:17,690
but in the end, by accident, he saved you.

276
00:23:19,110 --> 00:23:20,800
The world

277
00:23:22,280 --> 00:23:23,930
is full of tangled karma,

278
00:23:26,110 --> 00:23:28,770
always leaving people unsure of how to respond.

279
00:23:29,250 --> 00:23:31,020
Jiu's life

280
00:23:31,750 --> 00:23:34,110
was bought with Ying Lei's death.

281
00:23:34,910 --> 00:23:36,060
And your life

282
00:23:37,990 --> 00:23:40,790
was bought with Li Lun's and Jiu's deaths.

283
00:23:41,590 --> 00:23:42,510
Now,

284
00:23:44,070 --> 00:23:45,930
the lives of everyone in the world

285
00:23:46,150 --> 00:23:48,250
must be bought with my death.

286
00:23:51,590 --> 00:23:53,070
And my death

287
00:23:55,790 --> 00:23:58,330
must be bought with you bearing

288
00:23:59,340 --> 00:24:02,850
the same guilt and pain as Bingyi in the rest of your life.

289
00:24:14,910 --> 00:24:16,780
It's time to fulfill

290
00:24:18,430 --> 00:24:21,570
the vow you made when we first met.

291
00:24:23,430 --> 00:24:24,860
I, Zhuo Yichen,

292
00:24:25,710 --> 00:24:27,450
swear to the heavens.

293
00:24:27,750 --> 00:24:29,100
As long as Zhu Yan

294
00:24:29,170 --> 00:24:32,040
teaches me the true way to use the Cloud Light Sword,

295
00:24:33,090 --> 00:24:35,850
I will surely slay him with my sword.

296
00:24:43,070 --> 00:24:47,550
♫In this bustling world♫

297
00:24:49,100 --> 00:24:53,080

303
00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:42,970
Zhao Yuanzhou,

304
00:25:45,830 --> 00:25:47,620
do we have any other choice?

305
00:25:50,540 --> 00:25:51,910
Did Bingyi and Ying Long

306
00:25:54,830 --> 00:25:56,830
have any other choice?

307
00:26:03,110 --> 00:26:03,950
Ying Long,

308
00:26:04,110 --> 00:26:05,610
to save all living beings,

309
00:26:06,990 --> 00:26:08,430
turned into a star.

310
00:26:10,350 --> 00:26:11,630
But some people in later generations

311
00:26:11,630 --> 00:26:13,550
call him a demon.

312
00:26:15,160 --> 00:26:17,340
Bingyi, as a dragon slayer,

313
00:26:18,460 --> 00:26:20,130
was worshipped as a god

314
00:26:21,890 --> 00:26:24,020
but chose to live as a mortal

315
00:26:24,840 --> 00:26:26,290
in seclusion.

316
00:26:28,860 --> 00:26:30,120
How absurd

317
00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:34,870
is this world?

318
00:26:38,070 --> 00:26:40,200
Do you remember our agreement?

319
00:26:46,580 --> 00:26:47,390
Yes, I do.

320
00:26:50,390 --> 00:26:51,550
Mr. Zhuo,

321
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:53,830
this time,

322
00:26:55,290 --> 00:26:57,480
please make sure not to miss the mark.

323
00:27:11,060 --> 00:27:12,510
Mr. Zhuo,

324
00:27:14,570 --> 00:27:16,970
I knew you couldn't bring yourself to do it.

325
00:27:18,670 --> 00:27:20,220
So I decided long ago...

326
00:27:25,750 --> 00:27:28,280
that you wouldn't have to make a choice for me.

327
00:27:30,550 --> 00:27:32,720
This is my decision.

328
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:36,860
I am willing to bear the guilt

329
00:27:36,950 --> 00:27:40,210
of killing my dearest friend for all the lifetimes to come.

330
00:27:43,370 --> 00:27:45,400
You don't need to bear it for me.

331
00:27:49,690 --> 00:27:50,800
Zhuo,

332
00:27:53,870 --> 00:27:55,200
you're still so...

333
00:28:07,160 --> 00:28:08,420
Zhao Yuanzhou.

334
00:28:11,100 --> 00:28:12,210
Zhao Yuanzhou.

335
00:28:30,950 --> 00:28:32,190
Zhao Yuanzhou!

336
00:30:21,170 --> 00:30:23,100
The poison in my body...

337
00:30:24,230 --> 00:30:25,950
I've absorbed it all.

338
00:30:29,110 --> 00:30:30,100
Don't worry.

339
00:30:32,350 --> 00:30:33,440
It's fine now.

340
00:30:41,380 --> 00:30:43,720
Aren't I amazing?

341
00:31:06,890 --> 00:31:08,800
I know you are sad.

342
00:31:09,040 --> 00:31:10,780
But life is short.

343
00:31:12,620 --> 00:31:14,620
Don't be sad for too long.

344
00:31:16,110 --> 00:31:18,770
I can't bear to see you spend the rest of your life

345
00:31:19,400 --> 00:31:21,680
grieving for me.

346
00:31:22,870 --> 00:31:23,960
Your tears

347
00:31:24,070 --> 00:31:26,330
should be used to save all living beings.

348
00:31:27,880 --> 00:31:29,900
Don't let them fall for me.

349
00:32:02,470 --> 00:32:04,830
You won't die so easily.

350
00:32:05,720 --> 00:32:07,900
You said you would always be with me.

351
00:32:10,910 --> 00:32:12,270
You lied to me.

352
00:32:16,090 --> 00:32:17,750
You liar.

353
00:32:58,550 --> 00:32:59,930
Meeting you all

354
00:33:01,480 --> 00:33:05,780
was like having a long, beautiful dream.

355
00:33:07,780 --> 00:33:09,840
But dreams always end,

356
00:33:11,770 --> 00:33:13,170
and it's time for me

357
00:33:13,740 --> 00:33:15,420
to leave now.

358
00:33:28,790 --> 00:33:31,310
♫A lone boat drifts through the world♫

359
00:33:31,330 --> 00:33:33,970
♫The heart feels bitter, then sweet♫

360
00:33:34,260 --> 00:33:39,370
♫Can't distinguish night from day♫

361
00:33:40,710 --> 00:33:42,560
♫At the edge of the dreamscape♫

362
00:33:42,660 --> 00:33:45,260
♫Someone is longing for♫

363
00:33:45,480 --> 00:33:46,730
♫Softly calling for♫

364
00:33:46,830 --> 00:33:50,650
♫A past that can't be brought back♫

365
00:33:51,040 --> 00:33:53,570
♫The world echoes with a single sigh♫

366
00:33:53,670 --> 00:33:56,240
♫Love and hate each fills half the heart♫

367
00:33:56,470 --> 00:34:01,500
♫The years are filled with grudges and grace♫

368
00:34:02,820 --> 00:34:04,830
♫The cry of summer cicadas♫

369
00:34:04,870 --> 00:34:07,470
♫The slumber of winter snow♫

370
00:34:07,680 --> 00:34:12,929
♫No idle wishes and no hopeless longing for eternity♫

371
00:34:13,170 --> 00:34:18,489
♫Who saw the young man in beautiful clothes♫

372
00:34:18,989 --> 00:34:24,159
♫One step at a time, chasing every yesterday♫

373
00:34:20,330 --> 00:34:21,540
Zhao Yuanzhou,

374
00:34:22,199 --> 00:34:23,889
I fulfilled my vow,

375
00:34:24,659 --> 00:34:27,190
♫The sun beams down on the world♫

376
00:34:24,730 --> 00:34:26,010
but you didn't.

377
00:34:27,449 --> 00:34:29,929
♫Put everything behind♫

378
00:34:27,639 --> 00:34:28,980
You liar.

379
00:34:30,230 --> 00:34:35,510
♫You appear in my dream♫

380
00:34:32,179 --> 00:34:33,920
The road ahead is long,

381
00:34:34,330 --> 00:34:36,330
filled with hardships and dangers.

382
00:34:38,030 --> 00:34:39,340
Mr. Zhuo,

383
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:41,889
from now on,

384
00:34:42,389 --> 00:34:44,620
you will have to protect everyone on your own.

385
00:34:43,630 --> 00:34:48,199
♫The flower in my palm♫

386
00:34:48,520 --> 00:34:53,650
♫Is everchanging♫

387
00:34:54,469 --> 00:34:55,870
Use my body

388
00:34:54,489 --> 00:34:59,210
♫Sand slips through fingertips♫

389
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:59,930
to drive the powerful malicious energy in the world,

390
00:34:59,960 --> 00:35:04,720
♫Struggling again and again♫

391
00:35:00,460 --> 00:35:03,010
turning the tears of Baize Goddess into rain,

392
00:35:04,990 --> 00:35:06,350
falling on all things.

393
00:35:05,610 --> 00:35:10,270
♫The sea of suffering has no end♫

394
00:35:11,230 --> 00:35:12,030
This way,

395
00:35:11,260 --> 00:35:15,470
♫The spring breeze asks him♫

396
00:35:13,510 --> 00:35:15,530
everyone will be saved.

397
00:35:15,640 --> 00:35:20,960
♫What troubles turned his hair white♫

398
00:35:16,750 --> 00:35:18,980
But your soul will dissipate

399
00:35:19,510 --> 00:35:20,930
and cease to exist.

400
00:35:24,940 --> 00:35:26,170
Your tears

401
00:35:27,030 --> 00:35:29,290
should be used to save all living beings.

402
00:35:30,350 --> 00:35:32,190
Don't let them fall for me.

403
00:35:40,390 --> 00:35:42,050
Dead demons

404
00:35:42,660 --> 00:35:44,880
will turn into stars in the sky.

405
00:35:47,110 --> 00:35:48,380
And what about you?

406
00:35:50,880 --> 00:35:52,440
I will turn into rain.

407
00:35:54,660 --> 00:35:55,830
From now on,

408
00:35:56,370 --> 00:35:58,430
whenever it rains,

409
00:36:01,190 --> 00:36:03,050
it will be me coming to be with you.

410
00:36:04,540 --> 00:36:10,600
♫Someday I'll return to my old hometown♫

411
00:36:11,410 --> 00:36:17,570
♫Wearing old clothes but with eyes shining bright♫

412
00:36:18,260 --> 00:36:20,270
♫Holding brilliance in the right hand♫

413
00:36:20,340 --> 00:36:22,300
♫Biting down on all panic♫

414
00:36:22,320 --> 00:36:23,800
♫Wiping away frost with the left hand♫

415
00:36:23,820 --> 00:36:25,570
♫I finally look up♫

416
00:36:25,670 --> 00:36:28,480
♫You're in front of me♫

417
00:36:29,400 --> 00:36:31,630
♫Blocking the pain♫

418
00:36:32,610 --> 00:36:34,840
♫Who cries with swollen eyes?♫
