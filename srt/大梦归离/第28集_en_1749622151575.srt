1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,640
2nd

2
00:00:03,720 --> 00:00:06,040
R easier than ever

3
00:00:16,460 --> 00:00:26,700
B де vong

4
00:00:26,700 --> 00:00:30,700
I'm sorry, but I'm not sure if I can do it.

5
00:00:30,700 --> 00:00:34,700
I'm sorry, but I'm not sure if I can do it.

6
00:00:34,700 --> 00:00:38,700
I'm sorry, but I'm not sure if I can do it.

7
00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:42,700
I'm sorry, but I'm not sure if I can do it.

8
00:00:42,700 --> 00:00:46,700
I'm sorry, but I'm not sure if I can do it.

9
00:00:46,700 --> 00:00:50,700
I'm sorry, but I'm not sure if I can do it.

10
00:00:50,700 --> 00:00:54,700
I'm sorry, but I'm not sure if I can do it.

11
00:00:54,700 --> 00:00:58,700
I'm sorry, but I'm not sure if I can do it.

12
00:00:58,700 --> 00:01:02,700
I'm sorry, but I'm not sure if I can do it.

13
00:01:02,700 --> 00:01:06,700
I'm sorry, but I'm not sure if I can do it.

14
00:01:06,700 --> 00:01:10,700
I'm sorry, but I'm not sure if I can do it.

15
00:01:10,700 --> 00:01:14,700
I'm sorry, but I'm not sure if I can do it.

16
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:18,700
I'm sorry, but I'm not sure if I can do it.

17
00:01:18,700 --> 00:01:22,700
I'm sorry, but I'm not sure if I can do it.

18
00:01:22,700 --> 00:01:26,700
...

19
00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:30,700
...

20
00:01:30,700 --> 00:01:34,700
...

21
00:01:34,700 --> 00:01:38,700
...

22
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:42,700
...

23
00:01:42,700 --> 00:01:46,700
...

24
00:01:46,700 --> 00:01:50,700
This princess is very kind.

25
00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:52,700
Especially men.

26
00:01:52,700 --> 00:01:54,580
So I can only let Xiao Zhuo and the others

27
00:01:54,580 --> 00:01:56,580
escape in the White Land.

28
00:01:56,580 --> 00:01:58,580
Am I not a man?

29
00:01:58,580 --> 00:02:00,580
You are a man of fate.

30
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:05,980
If you need me, I can help you at any time.

31
00:02:06,980 --> 00:02:07,980
He He.

32
00:02:11,980 --> 00:02:13,980
I thought of Princess Long Yu.

33
00:02:13,980 --> 00:02:17,700
That's why I wanted to have a magical spell on them.

34
00:02:17,700 --> 00:02:19,700
A pure and pure son.

35
00:02:19,980 --> 00:02:20,980
Now,

36
00:02:20,980 --> 00:02:23,980
our plan is clear.

37
00:02:23,980 --> 00:02:25,980
I'm sorry.

38
00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:28,980
Do you want to be together with Zhao Yuanzhou?

39
00:02:28,980 --> 00:02:30,980
You're a dog.

40
00:02:30,980 --> 00:02:32,980
You're talking nonsense.

41
00:02:32,980 --> 00:02:34,980
He He.

42
00:02:34,980 --> 00:02:35,980
Mr. Xiao Zhuo,

43
00:02:35,980 --> 00:02:36,980
after the long-term,

44
00:02:36,980 --> 00:02:39,980
you've become more and more aggressive.

45
00:02:42,980 --> 00:02:44,980
But I'm more convinced that

46
00:02:44,980 --> 00:02:47,980
you're going to be a good man.

47
00:02:49,980 --> 00:02:53,980
If I were here,

48
00:02:53,980 --> 00:02:55,980
I would be happy to see Mr. Xiao Zhuo

49
00:02:55,980 --> 00:02:57,980
become a good man.

50
00:02:57,980 --> 00:02:59,980
I'm afraid of being a man.

51
00:03:00,980 --> 00:03:02,980
You're the most afraid of being a man.

52
00:03:02,980 --> 00:03:05,980
You're probably afraid of being a man.

53
00:03:09,980 --> 00:03:11,980
What do you eat at night?

54
00:03:11,980 --> 00:03:13,980
Do you eat ribs?

55
00:03:13,980 --> 00:03:15,980
What do you mean?

56
00:03:15,980 --> 00:03:18,980
Why don't you buy sugar and ribs?

57
00:03:19,980 --> 00:03:21,980
I'll buy some.

58
00:03:27,980 --> 00:03:29,980
It's not good to buy big yellows.

59
00:03:29,980 --> 00:03:31,980
I'll buy some for the people.

60
00:03:32,980 --> 00:03:34,980
Here it is.

61
00:03:49,980 --> 00:03:53,980
You're the god of Bai Ze?

62
00:03:53,980 --> 00:03:56,980
You're Zhu Yan?

63
00:03:56,980 --> 00:03:59,980
Look, I told you.

64
00:03:59,980 --> 00:04:01,980
The people of the big yellows know me.

65
00:04:01,980 --> 00:04:04,980
Zhu Yan is a very famous person.

66
00:04:04,980 --> 00:04:09,980
Please tell me the truth next time.

67
00:04:09,980 --> 00:04:13,980
The god of Bai Ze has solved my ban.

68
00:04:13,980 --> 00:04:15,980
He asked me to come here to do something.

69
00:04:15,980 --> 00:04:17,980
I want to.

70
00:04:18,260 --> 00:04:22,260
I want to marry a dragonfly.

71
00:04:22,260 --> 00:04:25,260
That's interesting.

72
00:04:25,260 --> 00:04:28,260
Why are there so many people who want my dragonfly?

73
00:04:28,260 --> 00:04:31,260
If anyone asks you to marry a dragonfly,

74
00:04:31,260 --> 00:04:33,260
if you don't want to die,

75
00:04:33,260 --> 00:04:35,260
then give me the dragonfly.

76
00:04:37,260 --> 00:04:41,260
Dragonflies can't touch or bite.

77
00:04:41,260 --> 00:04:46,260
They can't take poison or break the spirit.

78
00:04:46,540 --> 00:04:49,540
I have the will to die.

79
00:04:49,540 --> 00:04:52,540
I can't give up everything.

80
00:04:52,540 --> 00:04:55,540
You don't even know that.

81
00:05:04,540 --> 00:05:06,540
There's someone else.

82
00:05:11,540 --> 00:05:13,540
Princess Long Yu,

83
00:05:14,220 --> 00:05:18,220
your old friend sent you a letter.

84
00:05:34,420 --> 00:05:36,420
Mo Xuan.

85
00:05:44,220 --> 00:05:47,220
I'm a man.

86
00:05:47,220 --> 00:05:50,220
I'm the last one.

87
00:05:50,220 --> 00:05:53,220
Mo Xuan.

88
00:05:56,220 --> 00:05:58,220
Where did you get this?

89
00:05:58,220 --> 00:06:01,220
Do you want to know?

90
00:06:01,220 --> 00:06:05,220
The one who wants to die?

91
00:06:14,220 --> 00:06:17,220
What do you want?

92
00:06:17,220 --> 00:06:20,220
I'm poisoned.

93
00:06:20,220 --> 00:06:22,220
Who wants to detoxify?

94
00:06:22,220 --> 00:06:25,220
Poison?

95
00:06:25,220 --> 00:06:28,220
You're such a coward.

96
00:06:28,220 --> 00:06:33,220
There are many signs in the Imperial Department.

97
00:06:33,220 --> 00:06:36,220
They've opened many.

98
00:06:36,220 --> 00:06:38,220
Sign?

99
00:06:38,220 --> 00:06:40,220
No.

100
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:42,900
He's seen many.

101
00:06:42,900 --> 00:06:44,900
Sign?

102
00:06:44,900 --> 00:06:47,900
My grandfather didn't allow me to see this since I was a kid.

103
00:06:47,900 --> 00:06:50,900
He said it was a reward.

104
00:06:50,900 --> 00:06:52,900
I'm not that good.

105
00:06:52,900 --> 00:06:55,900
The one who saw it and said it to your grandfather,

106
00:06:55,900 --> 00:06:57,900
I'm not the same person.

107
00:06:57,900 --> 00:07:00,900
I want to marry a dragonfly and die for it.

108
00:07:00,900 --> 00:07:04,900
I can live with it forever.

109
00:07:05,580 --> 00:07:08,580
Isn't it?

110
00:07:08,580 --> 00:07:11,580
Of course.

111
00:07:11,580 --> 00:07:15,580
People say that love is shallow,

112
00:07:15,580 --> 00:07:18,580
and it's hard to get a good marriage.

113
00:07:18,580 --> 00:07:22,580
But I don't know if I can still get everything

114
00:07:22,580 --> 00:07:25,580
that I want.

115
00:07:29,580 --> 00:07:31,580
It's us.

116
00:07:32,260 --> 00:07:35,260
It's not a good marriage.

117
00:07:35,260 --> 00:07:40,260
We're destined to be together.

118
00:07:40,260 --> 00:07:44,260
You owed me the dragonfly.

119
00:07:44,260 --> 00:07:46,260
You owe me a life.

120
00:07:46,260 --> 00:07:49,260
Have you forgotten?

121
00:07:49,260 --> 00:07:51,260
I can't forget.

122
00:07:51,260 --> 00:07:54,260
I don't want to be with the Qing Palace.

123
00:07:54,260 --> 00:07:58,260
I want to live with them forever.

124
00:07:58,300 --> 00:08:00,300
Meng Xuan.

125
00:08:07,300 --> 00:08:10,300
These are the phoenix and the yellow-leaf.

126
00:08:10,300 --> 00:08:13,300
They're the secret treasure of the dragonfly clan.

127
00:08:13,300 --> 00:08:18,300
Now, I'll give you one of them.

128
00:08:18,300 --> 00:08:22,300
Phoenix has entered the team.

129
00:08:22,300 --> 00:08:27,300
If you don't marry me, I'll die for you.

130
00:08:29,260 --> 00:08:32,260
Xiang Guang.

131
00:08:32,260 --> 00:08:35,260
Don't be too worried.

132
00:08:35,260 --> 00:08:39,260
I was bitten by the phoenix.

133
00:08:39,260 --> 00:08:44,260
The grass is bad.

134
00:08:44,260 --> 00:08:48,260
You're good.

135
00:08:48,260 --> 00:08:52,260
I've found a princess.

136
00:08:52,260 --> 00:08:57,260
She can keep the secret treasure for the rest of her life.

137
00:08:58,260 --> 00:09:01,260
But she doesn't know that

138
00:09:01,260 --> 00:09:05,260
she wants to marry me.

139
00:09:05,260 --> 00:09:09,260
I'll let you and her baby live.

140
00:09:09,260 --> 00:09:13,260
I'll let you and her baby live.

141
00:09:13,260 --> 00:09:17,260
I'll let you and her baby live.

142
00:09:17,260 --> 00:09:21,260
You and your baby will live a good life.

143
00:09:21,260 --> 00:09:25,260
You and your baby will live a good life.

144
00:09:25,260 --> 00:09:27,260
But she doesn't know that

145
00:09:27,260 --> 00:09:31,260
she can talk to me in the middle of nowhere.

146
00:09:31,260 --> 00:09:33,260
She lied to me.

147
00:09:33,260 --> 00:09:37,260
She just wanted to save her baby.

148
00:09:37,260 --> 00:09:41,260
I hate her.

149
00:09:41,260 --> 00:09:46,260
I'm jealous of the one she's been protecting.

150
00:09:46,260 --> 00:09:50,260
So I've been killing you.

151
00:09:51,260 --> 00:09:54,260
Senior.

152
00:09:56,260 --> 00:09:59,260
Meng Xuan.

153
00:10:00,260 --> 00:10:03,260
Well...

154
00:10:03,260 --> 00:10:06,260
Help me take this medicine

155
00:10:06,260 --> 00:10:08,260
and leave it to my wife.

156
00:10:08,260 --> 00:10:11,260
I'll be there soon.

157
00:10:11,260 --> 00:10:14,260
I'll send it now.

158
00:10:14,260 --> 00:10:18,260
But I can't bear to kill Meng Xuan.

159
00:10:18,260 --> 00:10:22,260
So I asked her to meet me outside the city.

160
00:10:22,260 --> 00:10:25,260
I just wanted to take her away.

161
00:10:25,260 --> 00:10:28,260
I didn't expect her to be so unmarried.

162
00:10:28,260 --> 00:10:30,260
Brother Wen He.

163
00:10:30,260 --> 00:10:32,260
Where's Wen Xiao? It's been a long time.

164
00:10:32,260 --> 00:10:34,260
She's grown up a lot.

165
00:10:34,260 --> 00:10:36,260
I heard that she's been unwell recently.

166
00:10:36,260 --> 00:10:38,260
I'll send her a rose.

167
00:10:38,260 --> 00:10:40,260
It smells good.

168
00:10:40,260 --> 00:10:42,260
What's the smell?

169
00:10:42,260 --> 00:10:44,260
Sister-in-law.

170
00:10:44,260 --> 00:10:47,260
Brother Wen. We have to...

171
00:10:47,260 --> 00:10:49,260
Wen Xiao.

172
00:10:49,260 --> 00:10:51,260
Okay.

173
00:10:51,260 --> 00:10:53,260
Come on.

174
00:11:02,260 --> 00:11:06,260
I secretly put the special poison in Meng Xuan's house.

175
00:11:06,260 --> 00:11:08,260
The scent of bones.

176
00:11:08,260 --> 00:11:10,260
The scent of bones?

177
00:11:10,260 --> 00:11:14,260
The poison that was used to spread the special poison.

178
00:11:14,260 --> 00:11:18,260
Wen Xiao died because of me.

179
00:11:18,260 --> 00:11:23,260
It's a poison that's definitely a poison that's a part of the world.

180
00:11:23,260 --> 00:11:27,260
I wanted to kill her only.

181
00:11:28,260 --> 00:11:32,260
I didn't expect Meng Xuan to be unmarried.

182
00:11:32,260 --> 00:11:35,260
He went home early.

183
00:11:35,260 --> 00:11:38,260
Maybe God also feels that he's cruel.

184
00:11:38,260 --> 00:11:41,260
He's so cruel.

185
00:11:41,260 --> 00:11:44,260
Do you have a saying that

186
00:11:44,260 --> 00:11:47,260
skin is innocent and arms are guilty?

187
00:11:48,260 --> 00:11:53,260
Princess Long Yu may never be able to change.

188
00:11:53,260 --> 00:11:55,260
Those love-hate people

189
00:11:55,260 --> 00:12:01,260
are they coming for her or for her?

190
00:12:02,260 --> 00:12:04,260
The body is full of treasure.

191
00:12:04,260 --> 00:12:08,260
There will always be evil and cunning people around.

192
00:12:09,260 --> 00:12:12,260
Many times, to protect the treasure,

193
00:12:12,260 --> 00:12:16,260
you have become the leader of the world.

194
00:12:19,260 --> 00:12:22,260
It's just a choice.

195
00:12:22,260 --> 00:12:25,260
He can also choose not to.

196
00:12:26,260 --> 00:12:28,260
No matter what,

197
00:12:28,260 --> 00:12:33,260
the sword and teeth can't be left untouched.

198
00:12:34,260 --> 00:12:37,260
Meng Xuan is cruel,

199
00:12:37,260 --> 00:12:40,260
but you should die too.

200
00:12:41,260 --> 00:12:45,260
Meng Xuan's wife is pregnant and has a child.

201
00:12:45,260 --> 00:12:50,260
And you still killed my father.

202
00:13:04,260 --> 00:13:08,260
Meng Xuan's wife is pregnant and has a child.

203
00:13:08,260 --> 00:13:11,260
She's not pregnant anymore.

204
00:13:11,260 --> 00:13:14,260
She's not pregnant anymore.

205
00:13:14,260 --> 00:13:17,260
She's not pregnant anymore.

206
00:13:17,260 --> 00:13:20,260
She's not pregnant anymore.

207
00:13:20,260 --> 00:13:23,260
She's not pregnant anymore.

208
00:13:23,260 --> 00:13:26,260
She's not pregnant anymore.

209
00:13:26,260 --> 00:13:29,260
She's not pregnant anymore.

210
00:13:30,260 --> 00:13:32,260
I'm happy to see you

211
00:13:32,260 --> 00:13:35,260
when I'm being filial.

212
00:13:41,260 --> 00:13:45,260
I'll pay back what I owe you.

213
00:13:46,260 --> 00:13:49,260
But I have a request.

214
00:13:49,260 --> 00:13:50,260
What?

215
00:13:50,260 --> 00:13:53,260
I want to have a dragon-leaf.

216
00:13:53,260 --> 00:13:56,260
I want to have a dragon-leaf.

217
00:13:56,260 --> 00:13:57,260
What?

218
00:13:57,260 --> 00:14:00,260
I want to have a dragon-leaf.

219
00:14:00,260 --> 00:14:03,260
I'll pay back what I owe you.

220
00:14:27,260 --> 00:14:30,260
I'll pay back what I owe you.

221
00:14:48,260 --> 00:14:50,260
Wei Xiao.

222
00:14:51,260 --> 00:14:55,260
I thought you'd use the princess's guilt

223
00:14:55,260 --> 00:14:58,260
to make her pay back the dragon-leaf.

224
00:14:58,260 --> 00:15:00,260
But I didn't.

225
00:15:00,260 --> 00:15:01,260
Wei Xiao.

226
00:15:01,260 --> 00:15:03,260
Don't blame yourself.

227
00:15:03,260 --> 00:15:06,260
Not everyone is as kind as you are.

228
00:15:06,260 --> 00:15:08,260
Don't let others' evil

229
00:15:08,260 --> 00:15:11,260
make you do your own thing.

230
00:15:12,260 --> 00:15:15,260
Your expression is too heavy.

231
00:15:15,260 --> 00:15:18,260
People think that the emperor wants to talk about you.

232
00:15:18,260 --> 00:15:20,260
The emperor didn't.

233
00:15:20,260 --> 00:15:22,260
You did it.

234
00:15:22,260 --> 00:15:24,260
But you can't figure it out.

235
00:15:25,260 --> 00:15:27,260
This Lu Zi Xing doesn't understand.

236
00:15:27,260 --> 00:15:29,260
You should try it.

237
00:15:41,260 --> 00:15:43,260
Zhao Yuzhao.

238
00:15:43,260 --> 00:15:45,260
Why don't you give me the list

239
00:15:45,260 --> 00:15:47,260
to exchange for the dragon-leaf.

240
00:15:47,260 --> 00:15:49,260
To repair your silver sword.

241
00:15:54,260 --> 00:15:55,260
Zhao Yuzhao.

242
00:15:56,260 --> 00:15:59,260
You're talking about the dragon-leaf.

243
00:15:59,260 --> 00:16:01,260
Zhao Yuzhao.

244
00:16:01,260 --> 00:16:03,260
Zhao Yuzhao.

245
00:16:03,260 --> 00:16:05,260
Zhao Yuzhao.

246
00:16:05,260 --> 00:16:07,260
Zhao Yuzhao.

247
00:16:07,260 --> 00:16:09,260
Zhao Yuzhao.

248
00:16:09,260 --> 00:16:11,260
Zhao Yuzhao.

249
00:16:11,260 --> 00:16:14,260
You should take the list.

250
00:16:14,260 --> 00:16:18,260
I won't exchange anything with your list.

251
00:16:18,260 --> 00:16:21,260
I can't use the silver sword.

252
00:16:34,260 --> 00:16:36,260
It's useless to look at them.

253
00:16:36,260 --> 00:16:38,260
I'll take the sword.

254
00:16:38,260 --> 00:16:40,260
But I'll take the list.

255
00:16:40,260 --> 00:16:42,260
I'll take the list.

256
00:16:42,260 --> 00:16:43,260
Zhao Yuzhao.

257
00:16:43,260 --> 00:16:44,260
Don't force me.

258
00:16:44,260 --> 00:16:46,260
I didn't force you.

259
00:16:47,260 --> 00:16:49,260
I just don't want to push you

260
00:16:49,260 --> 00:16:51,260
into this tough role.

261
00:16:51,260 --> 00:16:54,260
So I'll choose for you.

262
00:16:54,260 --> 00:16:56,260
And it looks like

263
00:16:56,260 --> 00:16:58,260
Pei Si Jing and Ying Lei

264
00:16:58,260 --> 00:17:01,260
seem to be more familiar with me.

265
00:17:04,260 --> 00:17:06,260
I know you want to save Xiaojiao.

266
00:17:06,260 --> 00:17:08,260
But Zhao Yuzhao is our friend.

267
00:17:08,260 --> 00:17:10,260
Friend?

268
00:17:10,260 --> 00:17:12,260
Is he clear-headed?

269
00:17:12,260 --> 00:17:13,260
Why can't he be?

270
00:17:13,260 --> 00:17:14,260
You can do it yourself.

271
00:17:14,260 --> 00:17:16,260
You want to save yourself.

272
00:17:16,260 --> 00:17:18,260
You don't have to do this to everyone.

273
00:17:18,260 --> 00:17:19,260
You don't have to choose.

274
00:17:19,260 --> 00:17:21,260
I dare you.

275
00:17:21,260 --> 00:17:23,260
Xiaojiao is more important to us.

276
00:17:26,260 --> 00:17:28,260
If everything goes well today,

277
00:17:28,260 --> 00:17:30,260
I won't force Zhao Yuzhao.

278
00:17:30,260 --> 00:17:32,260
If what you said is my order,

279
00:17:32,260 --> 00:17:34,260
I'll send all of you out.

280
00:17:35,260 --> 00:17:37,260
But Xiaojiao and Zhao Yuzhou

281
00:17:37,260 --> 00:17:39,260
must die.

282
00:17:39,260 --> 00:17:41,260
I'll never let him die.

283
00:17:41,260 --> 00:17:43,260
Zhao Yuzhou.

284
00:17:46,260 --> 00:17:48,260
Ying Lei.

285
00:17:48,260 --> 00:17:50,260
I can't stand it

286
00:17:50,260 --> 00:17:52,260
when everyone is talking.

287
00:17:52,260 --> 00:17:54,260
I don't want to be cheated

288
00:17:54,260 --> 00:17:55,260
by myself.

289
00:17:55,260 --> 00:17:57,260
I don't want to be chosen by the police.

290
00:17:57,260 --> 00:17:59,260
Then Zhao Yuzhou doesn't want to be cheated.

291
00:17:59,260 --> 00:18:02,260
He doesn't want to be chosen by the police.

292
00:18:03,260 --> 00:18:05,260
He has never been

293
00:18:05,260 --> 00:18:08,260
chosen by anyone in his life.

294
00:18:11,260 --> 00:18:13,260
I'm wrong.

295
00:18:13,260 --> 00:18:15,260
I have.

296
00:18:15,260 --> 00:18:18,260
I chose him.

297
00:18:18,260 --> 00:18:21,260
So everyone gave up.

298
00:18:26,260 --> 00:18:28,260
Master Zhao.

299
00:18:28,260 --> 00:18:30,260
Don't you want to save Xiaojiao?

300
00:18:30,260 --> 00:18:32,260
She doesn't care about the place.

301
00:18:34,260 --> 00:18:36,260
She must be very scared.

302
00:18:38,260 --> 00:18:40,260
Every time she's scared,

303
00:18:42,260 --> 00:18:44,260
the one who wants to save her

304
00:18:44,260 --> 00:18:46,260
is you.

305
00:18:51,260 --> 00:18:53,260
Master Zhuo.

306
00:18:54,260 --> 00:18:56,260
I need you.

307
00:19:00,260 --> 00:19:02,260
No matter what,

308
00:19:03,260 --> 00:19:05,260
I'm standing here.

309
00:19:07,260 --> 00:19:09,260
We don't agree to sacrifice Zhao Yuzhou

310
00:19:09,260 --> 00:19:11,260
to replace Long Li.

311
00:19:12,260 --> 00:19:14,260
Without us,

312
00:19:14,260 --> 00:19:16,260
only you and Zhuo Yuzhou would be left.

313
00:19:27,260 --> 00:19:29,260
I thought

314
00:19:31,260 --> 00:19:34,260
we were just friends.

315
00:19:36,260 --> 00:19:38,260
I was wrong.

316
00:19:39,260 --> 00:19:41,260
Today,

317
00:19:43,260 --> 00:19:45,260
who will take away

318
00:19:45,260 --> 00:19:47,260
Zhao Yuzhou's burden?

319
00:19:48,260 --> 00:19:51,260
Let me go first.

320
00:19:52,260 --> 00:19:54,260
Don't bother.

321
00:19:54,260 --> 00:19:56,260
Don't move.

322
00:19:56,260 --> 00:19:58,260
I'll take my burden.

323
00:20:03,260 --> 00:20:05,260
I'll go by myself.

324
00:20:13,260 --> 00:20:15,260
Don't.

325
00:20:16,260 --> 00:20:18,260
Zhang Lanzhou.

326
00:20:18,260 --> 00:20:20,260
Zhang Lanzhou.

327
00:20:48,260 --> 00:20:50,260
Zhaoyuan.

328
00:21:14,260 --> 00:21:16,260
I took Zhao Yuzhou's burden.

329
00:21:16,260 --> 00:21:17,260
I brought it.

330
00:21:18,260 --> 00:21:19,260
Where's the letter?

331
00:21:47,260 --> 00:21:48,260
The letter is gone.

332
00:21:56,260 --> 00:21:59,260
This letter has no meaning to my son.

333
00:22:17,260 --> 00:22:18,260
You're not dead.

334
00:22:24,260 --> 00:22:26,260
If I had followed your promise that day,

335
00:22:27,260 --> 00:22:28,260
I would have gone to the woods.

336
00:22:30,260 --> 00:22:31,260
The day you were a little boy,

337
00:22:33,260 --> 00:22:34,260
that whole-hearted,

338
00:22:34,260 --> 00:22:35,260
and innocent man,

339
00:22:35,260 --> 00:22:36,260
not me,

340
00:22:36,260 --> 00:22:37,260
was my junior brother.

341
00:22:39,260 --> 00:22:40,260
He was the real dream.

342
00:22:40,260 --> 00:22:41,260
Come on!

343
00:22:41,260 --> 00:22:42,260
Come on!

344
00:22:42,260 --> 00:22:43,260
Come on!

345
00:22:43,260 --> 00:22:44,260
Come on!

346
00:22:44,260 --> 00:22:45,260
Come on!

347
00:22:45,260 --> 00:22:46,260
Come on!

348
00:22:47,260 --> 00:22:48,260
Now think about it.

349
00:22:48,260 --> 00:22:50,260
I still have feelings for you.

350
00:22:52,260 --> 00:22:54,260
It's because of this love.

351
00:22:56,260 --> 00:22:58,260
But it killed my beloved.

352
00:23:15,260 --> 00:23:16,260
You cheated me.

353
00:23:16,260 --> 00:23:17,260
You cheated me.

354
00:23:17,260 --> 00:23:18,260
You cheated me when I was in the forest.

355
00:23:18,260 --> 00:23:19,260
You never thought about it.

356
00:23:19,260 --> 00:23:20,260
You have a retribution?

357
00:23:22,260 --> 00:23:23,260
A retribution?

358
00:23:25,260 --> 00:23:27,260
God has still turned me down.

359
00:23:28,260 --> 00:23:29,260
You have been sending your own letter

360
00:23:29,260 --> 00:23:31,260
to the door for so many years.

361
00:23:33,260 --> 00:23:34,260
You're not going to die?

362
00:23:34,260 --> 00:23:35,260
No.

363
00:23:35,260 --> 00:23:36,260
I'm not going to die.

364
00:23:38,260 --> 00:23:39,260
I'm not going to die.

365
00:23:40,260 --> 00:23:41,260
I'm not going to die.

366
00:23:41,260 --> 00:23:43,260
You have been sending your own letter to the door for so many years.

367
00:23:45,260 --> 00:23:46,260
If you come here,

368
00:23:46,260 --> 00:23:47,260
I'll want you to die.

369
00:23:49,260 --> 00:23:50,260
I've been crying for so many years

370
00:23:50,260 --> 00:23:52,260
just to light up this day.

371
00:23:55,260 --> 00:23:56,260
For my wife

372
00:23:57,260 --> 00:23:59,260
and the child who was in the past.

373
00:24:12,260 --> 00:24:14,260
The sword of the Black Mirror.

374
00:24:24,260 --> 00:24:26,260
Looks like you're working with the people

375
00:24:26,260 --> 00:24:28,260
who killed Ji Yaosi.

376
00:24:42,260 --> 00:24:44,260
Ji Yaosi

377
00:24:59,260 --> 00:25:00,260
Chao Yuzhou.

378
00:25:01,260 --> 00:25:02,260
Why didn't you agree?

379
00:25:03,260 --> 00:25:04,260
You can exchange my burden

380
00:25:05,260 --> 00:25:06,260
for the dragon forest.

381
00:25:12,260 --> 00:25:14,260
Are you sure Master Dragon Forest will come?

382
00:25:15,260 --> 00:25:17,260
I've kept some eye-catching insects.

383
00:25:17,260 --> 00:25:19,260
I think the news is right.

384
00:25:21,260 --> 00:25:22,260
What about you?

385
00:25:22,260 --> 00:25:24,260
Are you sure you can match

386
00:25:24,260 --> 00:25:25,260
the fake one you gave him

387
00:25:25,260 --> 00:25:26,260
with Wuzong Yu?

388
00:25:27,260 --> 00:25:29,260
Wuzong Yu is a fake one.

389
00:25:30,260 --> 00:25:32,260
I hope he can clear his mind

390
00:25:32,260 --> 00:25:34,260
about the desire to take the burden.

391
00:25:37,260 --> 00:25:39,260
I think it's okay.

392
00:25:40,260 --> 00:25:41,260
But I don't think

393
00:25:41,260 --> 00:25:42,260
he's worried about it.

394
00:25:51,260 --> 00:25:52,260
Give it to me.

395
00:25:53,260 --> 00:25:54,260
Chaozhuo.

396
00:25:54,260 --> 00:25:55,260
Go.

397
00:26:05,260 --> 00:26:06,260
If I were you,

398
00:26:07,260 --> 00:26:08,260
I would be in trouble.

399
00:26:08,260 --> 00:26:09,260
The key is that

400
00:26:09,260 --> 00:26:11,260
Master Chaozhuo is very serious.

401
00:26:11,260 --> 00:26:13,260
He's a good actor

402
00:26:13,260 --> 00:26:15,260
and he's really good at acting.

403
00:26:16,260 --> 00:26:17,260
It's so embarrassing.

404
00:26:17,260 --> 00:26:18,260
Today,

405
00:26:19,260 --> 00:26:21,260
who wants to take the burden

406
00:26:23,260 --> 00:26:25,260
of Zhao Yanzhou?

407
00:26:30,260 --> 00:26:31,260
It seems that

408
00:26:31,260 --> 00:26:32,260
Chaozhuo has a problem with the position.

409
00:26:33,260 --> 00:26:34,260
If he sees it,

410
00:26:34,260 --> 00:26:35,260
the fish in the water will see it.

411
00:26:36,260 --> 00:26:37,260
It's okay with the position.

412
00:26:38,260 --> 00:26:39,260
Master Chaozhuo is just right.

413
00:26:39,260 --> 00:26:40,260
He's a good actor.

414
00:26:41,260 --> 00:26:42,260
He's usually lying.

415
00:26:42,260 --> 00:26:43,260
His ears are red.

416
00:26:43,260 --> 00:26:44,260
It's like blood.

417
00:26:45,260 --> 00:26:46,260
If he's lying,

418
00:26:46,260 --> 00:26:47,260
the fish in the water

419
00:26:47,260 --> 00:26:48,260
will see it.

420
00:26:48,260 --> 00:26:49,260
He can even turn his head.

421
00:26:49,260 --> 00:26:50,260
He's so funny.

422
00:27:03,260 --> 00:27:04,260
Here it is.

423
00:27:09,260 --> 00:27:11,260
The one who was poisoned by the dragon and fish group

424
00:27:11,260 --> 00:27:12,260
was dead.

425
00:27:14,260 --> 00:27:16,260
You'll die soon.

426
00:27:18,260 --> 00:27:20,260
I miss your wife.

427
00:27:22,260 --> 00:27:24,260
Just stay with them.

428
00:27:25,260 --> 00:27:27,260
I'll be with you.

429
00:27:39,260 --> 00:27:41,260
So you know now

430
00:27:42,260 --> 00:27:45,260
why you're here with me.

431
00:27:54,260 --> 00:27:56,260
You've given your secret to me?

432
00:27:57,260 --> 00:27:58,260
Yes.

433
00:28:00,260 --> 00:28:02,260
But I don't know

434
00:28:02,260 --> 00:28:04,260
if the dragon and fish group

435
00:28:04,260 --> 00:28:06,260
give it to you, you'll die.

436
00:28:07,260 --> 00:28:09,260
But you know

437
00:28:09,260 --> 00:28:11,260
I love you because I believe you.

438
00:28:12,260 --> 00:28:14,260
I'll tell you all my secrets.

439
00:28:15,260 --> 00:28:16,260
And you?

440
00:28:17,260 --> 00:28:19,260
The one who should die is you.

441
00:28:20,260 --> 00:28:21,260
Muxue.

442
00:28:24,260 --> 00:28:26,260
You're still calling your name

443
00:28:26,260 --> 00:28:27,260
now.

444
00:28:27,260 --> 00:28:28,260
Don't you think it's appropriate?

445
00:28:36,260 --> 00:28:37,260
I'm sorry.

446
00:28:38,260 --> 00:28:39,260
I'm sorry.

447
00:28:40,260 --> 00:28:41,260
I'm sorry.

448
00:28:42,260 --> 00:28:43,260
I'm sorry.

449
00:28:44,260 --> 00:28:45,260
I'm sorry.

450
00:28:46,260 --> 00:28:47,260
I'm sorry.

451
00:28:48,260 --> 00:28:49,260
I'm sorry.

452
00:28:50,260 --> 00:28:51,260
I'm sorry.

453
00:28:52,260 --> 00:28:53,260
I'm sorry.

454
00:28:54,260 --> 00:28:55,260
I'm sorry.

455
00:28:56,260 --> 00:28:57,260
I'm sorry.

456
00:28:58,260 --> 00:28:59,260
I'm sorry.

457
00:29:00,260 --> 00:29:01,260
I'm sorry.

458
00:29:02,260 --> 00:29:03,260
I'm sorry.

459
00:29:04,260 --> 00:29:05,260
I'm sorry.

460
00:29:07,260 --> 00:29:08,260
I'm sorry.

461
00:29:09,260 --> 00:29:10,260
I'm sorry.

462
00:29:12,260 --> 00:29:13,260
I'm sorry.

463
00:29:14,260 --> 00:29:15,260
I'm sorry.

464
00:29:16,260 --> 00:29:17,260
I'm sorry.

465
00:29:19,260 --> 00:29:21,260
I know you'll be fine.

466
00:29:22,260 --> 00:29:23,260
So I let you down in advance.

467
00:29:24,260 --> 00:29:26,260
I let you down.

468
00:29:28,260 --> 00:29:29,260
Muxue.

469
00:29:29,260 --> 00:29:30,260
I'm not Muxue.

470
00:29:33,260 --> 00:29:34,260
It's you.

471
00:29:34,260 --> 00:29:36,260
The child who killed me for the accident

472
00:29:37,260 --> 00:29:38,260
is all your fault.

473
00:29:39,260 --> 00:29:40,260
But don't worry.

474
00:29:42,260 --> 00:29:44,260
I'll send the whole mess

475
00:29:44,260 --> 00:29:45,260
to bury you.

476
00:30:02,260 --> 00:30:03,260
Let him go.

477
00:30:04,260 --> 00:30:06,260
There are a dozen of demons in the courtyard.

478
00:30:06,260 --> 00:30:08,260
I'll definitely make them pay for it.

479
00:30:09,260 --> 00:30:11,260
You haven't recovered your sword.

480
00:30:11,260 --> 00:30:13,260
Now we're in trouble.

481
00:30:14,260 --> 00:30:16,260
Don't clean the spirit first.

482
00:30:16,260 --> 00:30:18,260
Let's see what the Manzu people want to do.

483
00:30:30,260 --> 00:30:31,260
Miss.

484
00:30:31,260 --> 00:30:33,260
I'm going to see the patient.

485
00:30:33,260 --> 00:30:34,260
I'm sorry.

486
00:30:35,260 --> 00:30:36,260
My name is Long.

487
00:30:37,260 --> 00:30:38,260
Long Yu.

488
00:30:38,260 --> 00:30:40,260
How do you call me?

489
00:30:41,260 --> 00:30:42,260
Meng Xuan.

490
00:31:03,260 --> 00:31:04,260
Miss.

491
00:31:33,260 --> 00:31:34,260
Master Shen Yu.

492
00:31:35,260 --> 00:31:36,260
What are you thinking?

493
00:31:37,260 --> 00:31:39,260
I want to repair the Cloud Sword.

494
00:31:40,260 --> 00:31:42,260
Let Xiao Chou die.

495
00:31:42,260 --> 00:31:44,260
Let Xiao Da Bai leave.

496
00:31:45,260 --> 00:31:46,260
Let me make it clear.

497
00:31:47,260 --> 00:31:48,260
I'll make it clear.

498
00:31:49,260 --> 00:31:50,260
I'll make the world clear.

499
00:31:51,260 --> 00:31:52,260
I'll make it clear.

500
00:31:53,260 --> 00:31:54,260
I'll make it clear.

501
00:31:55,260 --> 00:31:56,260
I'll make it clear.

502
00:31:57,260 --> 00:31:58,260
I'll make it clear.

503
00:31:59,260 --> 00:32:00,260
I'll make it clear.

504
00:32:01,260 --> 00:32:02,260
I'll make it clear.

505
00:32:03,260 --> 00:32:04,260
I'll make it clear.

506
00:32:05,260 --> 00:32:06,260
What about me?

507
00:32:08,260 --> 00:32:09,260
Don't you miss me?

508
00:32:11,260 --> 00:32:12,260
Who said I didn't miss you?

509
00:32:13,260 --> 00:32:15,260
After knowing you,

510
00:32:16,260 --> 00:32:17,260
I realized more.

511
00:32:18,260 --> 00:32:20,260
What can you learn from me?

512
00:32:21,260 --> 00:32:22,260
Is that so?

513
00:32:27,260 --> 00:32:29,260
People can't choose their own origin.

514
00:32:30,260 --> 00:32:33,260
But they can choose their own life.

515
00:32:36,260 --> 00:32:37,260
You and Lileu

516
00:32:38,260 --> 00:32:40,260
have a lot of personal feelings.

517
00:32:43,260 --> 00:32:45,260
Lileu chose to be my tribe.

518
00:32:46,260 --> 00:32:47,260
To be close to the killing.

519
00:32:48,260 --> 00:32:49,260
And you

520
00:32:50,260 --> 00:32:53,260
are willing to believe in the nature.

521
00:32:54,260 --> 00:32:55,260
All the life

522
00:32:55,260 --> 00:32:58,260
is worth protecting and cherishing.

523
00:33:01,260 --> 00:33:03,260
Although we are destined to be together,

524
00:33:04,260 --> 00:33:06,260
we are still together.

525
00:33:10,260 --> 00:33:11,260
It's good.

526
00:33:15,260 --> 00:33:17,260
Actually, all of us

527
00:33:18,260 --> 00:33:19,260
are on the same page.

528
00:33:20,260 --> 00:33:22,260
You are on the earth of destiny.

529
00:33:22,260 --> 00:33:24,260
You are on the earth of destiny.

530
00:33:25,260 --> 00:33:27,260
Life is like a falling leaf.

531
00:33:29,260 --> 00:33:31,260
It's blown by the wind.

532
00:33:33,260 --> 00:33:37,260
The相 is separated.

533
00:33:39,260 --> 00:33:40,260
I'm scared.

534
00:33:42,260 --> 00:33:43,260
One day,

535
00:33:46,260 --> 00:33:49,260
we will be shattered.

536
00:33:53,260 --> 00:33:54,260
Don't be afraid.

537
00:33:55,260 --> 00:33:56,260
How can I not be afraid?

538
00:33:58,260 --> 00:33:59,260
I'm afraid of separation.

539
00:34:02,260 --> 00:34:03,260
I'm afraid that when I wake up,

540
00:34:06,260 --> 00:34:09,260
the sky and earth will be empty.

541
00:34:15,260 --> 00:34:16,260
The longer the dream,

542
00:34:17,260 --> 00:34:18,260
the more I will wake up.

543
00:34:19,260 --> 00:34:21,260
The dream will come true.

544
00:34:22,260 --> 00:34:23,260
I'm brave.

545
00:34:27,260 --> 00:34:28,260
So,

546
00:34:30,260 --> 00:34:31,260
don't be afraid.

547
00:34:35,260 --> 00:34:36,260
Yes.

548
00:34:39,260 --> 00:34:40,260
With your two-year-old ambition,

549
00:34:40,260 --> 00:34:41,260
you must protect me.

550
00:34:45,260 --> 00:34:46,260
There's nothing to be afraid of.

551
00:34:52,260 --> 00:34:53,260
No wonder you had to

552
00:34:54,260 --> 00:34:55,260
pull me out of the world.

553
00:34:59,260 --> 00:35:01,260
I had a great idea last night.

554
00:35:08,260 --> 00:35:09,260
You are

555
00:35:10,260 --> 00:35:12,260
the White Goddess now.

556
00:35:13,260 --> 00:35:15,260
You have seen many big and small things.

557
00:35:16,260 --> 00:35:17,260
You have to live well.

558
00:35:18,260 --> 00:35:19,260
They all hope

559
00:35:19,260 --> 00:35:21,260
to be protected by the White Goddess.

560
00:35:24,260 --> 00:35:26,260
Why do I feel like a baby

561
00:35:27,260 --> 00:35:29,260
after blowing the wood every time?

562
00:35:43,260 --> 00:35:44,260
Let's live together.

563
00:35:50,260 --> 00:35:51,260
Let's live together.

564
00:35:57,260 --> 00:35:58,260
What's wrong?

565
00:36:01,260 --> 00:36:03,260
Since we have agreed to live,

566
00:36:05,260 --> 00:36:06,260
let's change the name.

567
00:36:19,260 --> 00:36:20,260
I'll go to find him.

568
00:36:21,260 --> 00:36:22,260
No need.

569
00:36:24,260 --> 00:36:26,260
The mountain is full of flowers.

570
00:36:27,260 --> 00:36:28,260
I'll be in a hurry.

571
00:36:31,260 --> 00:36:32,260
No need to bother.

572
00:36:50,260 --> 00:36:51,260
Don't worry.

573
00:36:53,260 --> 00:36:55,260
I'll help you get to the Dragon-Demon Realm.

574
00:37:20,260 --> 00:37:21,260
I'll go to find him.

575
00:37:35,260 --> 00:37:36,260
You still are angry.

576
00:37:42,260 --> 00:37:43,260
Xiao Zhu, don't be angry.

577
00:37:44,260 --> 00:37:46,260
Next time, I'll play the game with you.

578
00:37:46,260 --> 00:37:47,260
It's not like you're going to win.

579
00:37:47,260 --> 00:37:49,260
Don't do it again.

580
00:37:50,260 --> 00:37:54,260
It's not suitable for me to fight with this thing.

581
00:38:00,260 --> 00:38:01,260
Zhao Yanzhou,

582
00:38:02,260 --> 00:38:03,260
how come you can't do it?

583
00:38:09,260 --> 00:38:12,260
I can use it to repair the cloud sword for you.

584
00:38:14,260 --> 00:38:15,260
Don't worry.

585
00:38:18,260 --> 00:38:19,260
Long Lin only has one sword.

586
00:38:20,260 --> 00:38:21,260
And we won't repair it.

587
00:38:24,260 --> 00:38:26,260
It's better to wait for Lord Bai Yan to come back.

588
00:38:27,260 --> 00:38:30,260
You are a good person.

589
00:38:31,260 --> 00:38:32,260
You can't be too hasty.

590
00:38:34,260 --> 00:38:35,260
Then,

591
00:38:36,260 --> 00:38:37,260
Long Lin will...

592
00:38:37,260 --> 00:38:38,260
You can keep it for me.

593
00:38:46,260 --> 00:38:47,260
You?

594
00:38:48,260 --> 00:38:49,260
What's wrong with me?

595
00:38:51,260 --> 00:38:54,260
You look so strong.

596
00:38:56,260 --> 00:38:57,260
Don't worry.

597
00:38:57,260 --> 00:38:58,260
I will keep my word.

598
00:38:58,260 --> 00:38:59,260
I will keep my word.

599
00:39:00,260 --> 00:39:01,260
Even if the Mount Tai is broken,

600
00:39:02,260 --> 00:39:03,260
I won't open my eyes.

601
00:39:04,260 --> 00:39:05,260
You are a god of sand.

602
00:39:05,260 --> 00:39:06,260
You said the Mount Tai is broken.

603
00:39:07,260 --> 00:39:08,260
Is that really good?

604
00:39:11,260 --> 00:39:12,260
I will leave it to Ying Lei.

605
00:39:12,260 --> 00:39:13,260
I don't worry.

606
00:39:13,260 --> 00:39:14,260
It's about Xiaoqiu.

607
00:39:15,260 --> 00:39:16,260
He will definitely see it better than himself.

608
00:39:21,260 --> 00:39:22,260
Fine.

609
00:39:24,260 --> 00:39:25,260
But,

610
00:39:27,260 --> 00:39:29,260
he will come back to rob Long Lin

611
00:39:29,260 --> 00:39:31,260
if he wants to help our Xiaojian.

612
00:39:33,260 --> 00:39:35,260
I will keep my word.

613
00:39:50,260 --> 00:39:51,260
I have the safety of the treasure.

614
00:39:51,260 --> 00:39:53,260
I used the magic power to limit it.

615
00:39:53,260 --> 00:39:55,260
No one can open it.

616
00:39:55,260 --> 00:39:56,260
Then,

617
00:39:56,260 --> 00:39:57,260
everything will be lost.

618
00:40:04,260 --> 00:40:05,260
Old man.

619
00:40:05,260 --> 00:40:06,260
What are you doing?

620
00:40:08,260 --> 00:40:09,260
I am worried

621
00:40:10,260 --> 00:40:12,260
that Lilan will rob Long Lin.

622
00:40:17,260 --> 00:40:18,260
Old man.

623
00:40:19,260 --> 00:40:20,260
Old man,

624
00:40:21,260 --> 00:40:22,260
what are you doing?

625
00:40:24,260 --> 00:40:25,260
I'm worried

626
00:40:26,260 --> 00:40:28,260
that Lilan will rob Long Lin.

627
00:40:29,260 --> 00:40:30,260
Long Lin?

628
00:40:30,260 --> 00:40:32,500
Harlequin took Longli away.

629
00:40:37,260 --> 00:40:38,060
Longli, are you okay?

630
00:40:39,420 --> 00:40:40,180
I saw it.

631
00:40:45,220 --> 00:40:46,140
Show me.

632
00:40:48,700 --> 00:40:49,260
Okay.

633
00:41:01,140 --> 00:41:03,060
You are laughing.

634
00:41:07,140 --> 00:41:09,140
Fools.

635
00:41:11,660 --> 00:41:13,020
If you fool me around,

636
00:41:15,020 --> 00:41:16,500
I am not Fahad accomplished.

637
00:41:18,700 --> 00:41:19,900
Don't talk to me like this.

638
00:41:20,540 --> 00:41:22,140
How can you call myself aWorker?

639
00:41:23,260 --> 00:41:27,220
I can be the one who bully.

640
00:41:27,220 --> 00:41:27,720
Hurry!

641
00:41:32,260 --> 00:41:32,760
Stop!

642
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:37,260
Lord Baiyan is back.

643
00:41:37,680 --> 00:41:38,960
We should take Long Lin

644
00:41:38,960 --> 00:41:40,260
to find Lord Baiyan's address.

645
00:41:40,560 --> 00:41:41,880
How to repair the Cloud Light Sword?

646
00:41:45,420 --> 00:41:46,180
Where is Ying Lei?

647
00:41:52,960 --> 00:41:54,020
It's Aoying again.

648
00:41:55,420 --> 00:41:56,300
Long Lin was robbed.

649
00:41:57,380 --> 00:41:58,780
It seems that Ying Lei is after Aoying.

650
00:41:59,180 --> 00:42:00,100
We should save him.

651
00:42:00,300 --> 00:42:01,180
We should take Long Lin back.

652
00:42:07,300 --> 00:42:07,980
Lord Zhuo.

653
00:42:08,820 --> 00:42:09,820
What are you doing?

654
00:42:17,780 --> 00:42:18,700
Is he

655
00:42:19,540 --> 00:42:20,500
Aoying?

656
00:42:25,060 --> 00:42:26,100
He is not Aoying.

657
00:42:27,260 --> 00:42:28,380
He is Shang Yun Zhou.

658
00:42:29,780 --> 00:42:31,300
But he is hiding something from us.

659
00:42:33,100 --> 00:42:34,060
Lord Zhuo.

660
00:42:34,620 --> 00:42:35,700
Why do you say that?

661
00:42:36,500 --> 00:42:38,420
Long Lin was really taken away by Aoying?

662
00:42:42,420 --> 00:42:43,540
The gold and silver of Baiqiang

663
00:42:44,100 --> 00:42:45,300
are on the mountain.

664
00:42:48,540 --> 00:42:49,100
Lord.

665
00:42:50,380 --> 00:42:51,540
I have robbed Long Lin.

666
00:42:58,220 --> 00:42:58,980
I can't take it.

667
00:43:00,940 --> 00:43:01,460
Give it to me.

668
00:43:04,940 --> 00:43:05,940
I don't want to drink.

669
00:43:07,340 --> 00:43:08,180
Give me your hand.

670
00:43:27,340 --> 00:43:28,540
Your head hurts a lot.

671
00:43:28,540 --> 00:43:30,500
Itẫy you normally!

672
00:43:31,020 --> 00:43:31,780
Sh Word!

673
00:43:45,540 --> 00:43:46,720
Your lokandum

674
00:43:47,820 --> 00:43:48,380
is nothing.

675
00:43:51,020 --> 00:43:52,740
YourHa transforms no matter a true一.

676
00:43:53,840 --> 00:43:55,260
Don't waste your energy on me!

677
00:43:57,220 --> 00:44:01,220
Stay with me, Jiang Si Zhi,

678
00:44:01,220 --> 00:44:03,220
before I'm old.

679
00:44:05,220 --> 00:44:08,220
If I die,

680
00:44:09,220 --> 00:44:12,220
I'll give you all the power.

681
00:44:27,220 --> 00:44:29,220
I'm sorry.

682
00:44:38,220 --> 00:44:40,220
I'm sorry.

683
00:44:41,220 --> 00:44:43,220
It seems that Zhao Yanzhou

684
00:44:45,220 --> 00:44:47,220
has completely forgotten

685
00:44:48,220 --> 00:44:52,220
all the things he had taught me.

686
00:44:54,220 --> 00:44:56,220
His old and young tricks.

687
00:44:58,220 --> 00:45:00,220
Your grace.

688
00:45:04,220 --> 00:45:06,220
You've become a animal.

689
00:45:07,220 --> 00:45:09,220
I'll let you go.

690
00:45:22,220 --> 00:45:23,220
Where's Long Ling?

691
00:45:57,220 --> 00:45:59,220
I'll go with you.

692
00:46:00,220 --> 00:46:02,220
I'll go with you.

693
00:46:02,220 --> 00:46:04,220
I'll go with you.

694
00:46:04,220 --> 00:46:06,220
I'll go with you.

695
00:46:06,220 --> 00:46:08,220
I'll go with you.

696
00:46:08,220 --> 00:46:10,220
I'll go with you.

697
00:46:10,220 --> 00:46:12,220
I'll go with you.

698
00:46:12,220 --> 00:46:14,220
I'll go with you.

699
00:46:14,220 --> 00:46:16,220
I'll go with you.

700
00:46:16,220 --> 00:46:18,220
I'll go with you.

701
00:46:18,220 --> 00:46:20,220
I'll go with you.

702
00:46:20,220 --> 00:46:22,220
I'll go with you.

703
00:46:22,220 --> 00:46:24,220
I'll go with you.

704
00:46:24,220 --> 00:46:26,220
I'll go with you.

705
00:46:26,220 --> 00:46:28,220
I'll go with you.

706
00:46:56,220 --> 00:46:58,220
I'll go with you.
