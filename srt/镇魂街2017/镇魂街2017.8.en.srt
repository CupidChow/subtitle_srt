2
00:00:17,830 --> 00:00:21,270
Your guardian spirit can move in a flash and has the ability to evolve?

3
00:00:21,270 --> 00:00:23,910
Please don't get emotional.

4
00:00:23,910 --> 00:00:25,540
Your whole body is full of words, right?

5
00:00:25,540 --> 00:00:27,960
Fire general, don't get emotional.

6
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:30,080
You're a God!

7
00:00:31,910 --> 00:00:35,860
Fire General, please, don't get emotional.

8
00:00:37,190 --> 00:00:40,680
The call out and call in of guardian spirit are very important during battle.

9
00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:45,070
Just now I used call in to make guardian spirit escape from Xu Chu's attack.

10
00:00:45,070 --> 00:00:47,060
And then used call out

11
00:00:47,060 --> 00:00:51,750
to make guardian spirit appear at the back of Fire General and attack directly the vital part.

12
00:00:51,750 --> 00:00:53,920
This is just cheating.

13
00:00:55,530 --> 00:00:58,930
This is called, breath.

14
00:00:58,930 --> 00:01:00,580
Breath?

15
00:01:00,580 --> 00:01:04,290
The call out of guardian spirit needs to consume a lot of physical strength at once.

16
00:01:04,290 --> 00:01:08,760
Normally, after one time of call out and call in of guardian spirit,

17
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:11,640
it's hard for most people to call out the second time within a short time.

18
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:14,990
So, the skill of able to call in guardian spirit

19
00:01:14,990 --> 00:01:18,150
and quickly release during one breathing,

20
00:01:18,150 --> 00:01:20,770
is breath.

21
00:01:21,390 --> 00:01:25,770
This is a top skill of call out guardian spirit.

22
00:01:25,770 --> 00:01:30,640
Then are there a lot of spirit hosts who master the breath skill?

23
00:01:32,450 --> 00:01:34,400
One in ten thousand.

24
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:35,720
One in ten thousand...

25
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:38,610
The number one combat force organization of Ghostdom, Heroes Hall,

26
00:01:38,610 --> 00:01:41,320
the eligibility of joining is very strict.

27
00:01:41,320 --> 00:01:45,100
Only spirit host with at least Tapana level is eligible to take the assessment.

28
00:01:45,100 --> 00:01:50,550
But if you master the breath once, you may join Heroes Hall directly.

29
00:01:51,710 --> 00:01:56,870
Over two thousand years ago, the first chief of Heroes Hall wanted to measure his own limit of continuance,

30
00:01:56,870 --> 00:02:00,490
repeatedly using breath for 32 times continuously.

31
00:02:00,490 --> 00:02:03,400
In the end died of physical exhaustion.

32
00:02:03,870 --> 00:02:09,030
And 32 times breath became the strength limit of spirit host.

33
00:02:09,030 --> 00:02:12,260
It hasn't been surpassed yet over two thousand years.

34
00:02:14,610 --> 00:02:18,390
This is the limit of spirit host.

35
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:28,160
 Rakshasa Street 

36
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:30,220
  Episode 8  

37
00:03:35,010 --> 00:03:38,710
  Master, please adjust your breathing pace. 

38
00:03:42,850 --> 00:03:44,540
Start.

39
00:03:53,370 --> 00:03:55,770
The skill of using guardian spirit is—

40
00:03:55,770 --> 00:03:57,540
Wait a moment.

41
00:03:57,540 --> 00:04:01,130
Do you hear a burst of sound?

42
00:04:30,330 --> 00:04:32,640
Why does she look like she collapsed?

43
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:37,160
Miss Xia looks like she had just experienced a very fierce battle

44
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:40,660
Isn't she training with her guardian spirit?

45
00:04:40,660 --> 00:04:44,180
Why does it look like...

46
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:47,710
she had field operation?

47
00:04:47,710 --> 00:04:49,030
Field operation?

48
00:04:49,030 --> 00:04:53,240
Which is the short form of having an operation in the field.

49
00:04:57,480 --> 00:05:01,790
Then it's me who is not pure. I thought...

50
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:05,650
Miss Xia.

51
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:25,590
You need a reason in order to hit a person.

52
00:05:25,590 --> 00:05:27,240
It hurts.

53
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:47,650
Why did I bring a love-struck fool on the journey?

54
00:05:47,650 --> 00:05:50,300
 Because you are an idiot! 

55
00:05:50,300 --> 00:05:53,440
Right. It seems like I am.

56
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:56,360
Why was I frontin' that time, saying only let her block one move?

57
00:05:56,360 --> 00:05:58,860
I should have said two moves.

58
00:05:59,990 --> 00:06:03,610
Fire General, I didn't do it on purpose.

59
00:06:03,610 --> 00:06:06,480
It's alright, I was just lost.

60
00:06:09,370 --> 00:06:11,320
Lunch is here.

61
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:35,930
Ba Wang...

62
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:41,070
Lunch is here.

63

  Timing and Subtitles brought to you by The Spiritual Guardians @ Viki 

64
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:56,650
Hey.

65
00:06:57,660 --> 00:07:02,320
It's very rude to look at a girl like that the first time.

66
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:04,410
Are you her boyfriend?

67
00:07:04,410 --> 00:07:06,270
Of course not1

68
00:07:06,270 --> 00:07:08,890
Then it doesn't concern you.

69
00:07:08,890 --> 00:07:11,670
Right. It doesn't concern me.

70
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:14,870
You are Cao Yan Bing?

71
00:07:14,870 --> 00:07:16,590
You know me?

72
00:07:17,300 --> 00:07:19,170
Look at it yourself.

73
00:07:22,790 --> 00:07:25,490
It's really you. Very ugly.

74
00:07:26,490 --> 00:07:28,650
I'm wanted.

75
00:07:30,130 --> 00:07:32,250
So you came to catch me?

76
00:07:32,250 --> 00:07:37,380
Depending on the situation, I might kill you.

77
00:07:39,220 --> 00:07:42,720
Let me tell you. The last person who said this to me,

78
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:46,470
the grass has grown this high now.

79
00:07:46,470 --> 00:07:51,230
Do you know? Previously, everyone who laughed at me like this,

80
00:07:51,230 --> 00:07:53,290
it's better they died than live.

81
00:07:53,290 --> 00:07:54,920
Little kid.

82
00:07:54,920 --> 00:07:56,060
Bastard

83
00:07:56,060 --> 00:07:59,870
A mere nobody like you, couldn't understand this broad world.

84
00:07:59,870 --> 00:08:04,610
You this 2D organism, better don't spend your effort to understand the 3D world.

85
00:08:04,610 --> 00:08:06,180
Stop.

86
00:08:06,850 --> 00:08:10,460
Haven't both of you chat enough? Are you fighting or not?

87
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:15,090
Fight.

88
00:08:21,550 --> 00:08:25,200
Talked so much nonsense, but you're just a living dart board.

89
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:27,550
I was just thinking,

90
00:08:28,420 --> 00:08:32,450
I think it's better to kill you to make things easy.

91
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:34,340
What do you think?

92
00:08:34,340 --> 00:08:35,950
Acting.

93
00:08:40,330 --> 00:08:43,500
Cao Yan Bing. Cao Yan Bing. How are you?

94
00:08:51,090 --> 00:08:56,000
According to your level, you're not fit to die under my spear.

95
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:00,740
But today I saw some beautiful stuff, so I'm in a good mood.

96
00:09:06,740 --> 00:09:08,400
Stop!

97
00:09:13,260 --> 00:09:15,430
I've been waiting for you.

98
00:09:25,450 --> 00:09:26,940
Lord.

99
00:09:29,250 --> 00:09:30,570
What happened?

100
00:09:30,570 --> 00:09:34,000
Lord, Xiang Kun Lun found Cao Yan Bing.

101
00:09:35,300 --> 00:09:37,550
It's unexpected.

102
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:41,330
Xiang Kun Lun? The head of Heroes Hall?

103
00:09:41,330 --> 00:09:44,660
The person who people address as the strongest man?

104
00:09:44,660 --> 00:09:49,050
If so, Cao Yan Bing might be dead already.

105
00:09:49,050 --> 00:09:51,030
Isn't that helping us quickly?

106
00:09:51,030 --> 00:09:56,120
If Xiang Kun Lun didn't kill Cao Yan Bing,

107
00:09:56,120 --> 00:09:59,360
If Xiang Kun Lun bring Cao Yan Bing

108
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:02,010
to Heroes Hall to interrogate him?

109
00:10:02,010 --> 00:10:07,400
If Cao Yan Bing, this weak bone says something,

110
00:10:08,980 --> 00:10:11,520
The issues keep arising.

111
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:18,490
Hattori, inform bounty hunters that

112
00:10:18,490 --> 00:10:20,740
if Cao Yan Bing hasn't died,

113
00:10:20,740 --> 00:10:24,640
don't hesitate to kill Cao Yan Bing from Xiang Kun Lun's hand at all costs.

114
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:26,160
I abide by your orders.

115
00:10:29,380 --> 00:10:32,350
They're not Xiang Kun Lun's level.

116
00:10:32,350 --> 00:10:37,670
I know. That's why it's better to let them kill Cao Yan Bing.

117
00:10:37,670 --> 00:10:42,180
And then let Xiang Kun Lun wipe them out.

118
00:10:43,130 --> 00:10:45,250
I win.

119
00:10:55,190 --> 00:10:59,570
I have cut off your sense of pain. Just leave the rest to me.

120
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:03,000
Old Ghost,

121
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:05,570
be careful.

122
00:11:20,590 --> 00:11:22,980
Beating my student to become like this,

123
00:11:22,980 --> 00:11:26,240
it makes me lose respect.

124
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:28,320
Are you Guifu Santong?

125
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:30,670
That's me.

126
00:11:30,670 --> 00:11:32,820
I came to find you.

127
00:11:32,820 --> 00:11:34,260
You didn't come to capture him?

128
00:11:34,260 --> 00:11:35,860
No.

129
00:11:35,860 --> 00:11:37,560
You beat him to become like this?

130
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:43,150
Miss, just then when he hit me, do you think he didn't use enough strength?

131
00:11:44,060 --> 00:11:46,490
If not because I'm very powerful,

132
00:11:46,490 --> 00:11:49,720
the person who is on the ground, would be me.

133
00:11:49,720 --> 00:11:51,250
Who are you?

134
00:11:51,250 --> 00:11:53,360
Xiang Kun Lun

135
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:54,610
You are Xiang Kun Lun?

136
00:11:54,610 --> 00:11:55,970
Xiang Kun Lun. Who's that?

137
00:11:55,970 --> 00:11:59,300
Why does the head of Heroes Hall want to find me?

138
00:11:59,300 --> 00:12:04,420
Because someone told me that Guifu Santong isn't your real name.

139
00:12:04,420 --> 00:12:06,900
Your real name is...

140
00:12:09,050 --> 00:12:12,800
Huangfu Longdou

141
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:14,220
You are Huangfu Longdou?!

142
00:12:14,220 --> 00:12:17,400
Huangfu Longdou. Who is that?

143
00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:20,090
It's not me.

144
00:12:20,090 --> 00:12:23,680
Even if you are, you won't admit it.

145
00:12:24,250 --> 00:12:28,140
It doesn't matter. We'll know after testing.

148
00:13:01,870 --> 00:13:04,510
 [ Xing Tian ] 

149
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:33,350
Their guardian spirits move so fast.

150
00:14:33,350 --> 00:14:35,730
I can't see the process completely.

151
00:14:35,730 --> 00:14:37,420
It's not the moves.

152
00:14:38,840 --> 00:14:40,760
It's breath.

153
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:29,200
You're very strong, but you're not Huangfu Longdou.

154
00:15:29,820 --> 00:15:34,570
The real Huangfu Longdou must be more than this.

155
00:15:40,300 --> 00:15:42,180
And you,

156
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:46,810
letting the master save you first, then letting a girl save you.

157
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:52,470
Such a trash like you, better go surrender yourself to seek for lenient punishment.

158
00:15:52,470 --> 00:15:56,990
If Heroes Hall sends people to catch you, the person in the least prominent seat is good enough to do it.

159
00:16:00,430 --> 00:16:02,970
Cao Yan Bing! Cao Yan Bing!

160
00:16:07,860 --> 00:16:10,920
Mr Gui. Are you ok?

161
00:16:11,890 --> 00:16:15,900
The head of Heroes Hall is indeed lived up to his reputation.

162
00:16:15,900 --> 00:16:20,420
He used breath 17 times, yet he didn't even sweat one drop.

163
00:16:22,090 --> 00:16:24,420
Are you Huangfu Longdou?

164
00:16:26,700 --> 00:16:31,100
If I'm Huangfu Longdou, at this moment here,

165
00:16:31,100 --> 00:16:33,480
I would be Xiang Kun Lun.

166
00:16:34,140 --> 00:16:35,790
Who is Huangfu Longdou?

167
00:16:35,790 --> 00:16:38,590
Also, why must Huangfu Longdou be found?

168
00:16:38,590 --> 00:16:41,860
He was known as the strongest spirit host of the previous generation.

169
00:16:41,860 --> 00:16:44,910
He is also the most wanted man in requiem streets.

170
00:16:44,910 --> 00:16:50,400
He is currently the strongest of all the spirit hosts.

171
00:16:52,020 --> 00:16:58,870
Breath is just like the martial artists had competition with their internal forces in the past, it's extremely dangerous.

172
00:16:58,870 --> 00:17:03,900
Often, if it isn't that I win and you die, then it would be that both sides are gravely injured.

173
00:17:07,650 --> 00:17:09,260
I finally understand

174
00:17:09,260 --> 00:17:16,440
Breath... is the way to directly combat between spirit hosts.

175
00:17:16,440 --> 00:17:19,180
To the guardian spirit, it'll collapse of itself.

176
00:17:19,180 --> 00:17:25,340
The young man is indeed worthy to be taught, worth my teaching by using my life.

177
00:17:38,570 --> 00:17:42,870
Fire General, Miss Xia. I want to say something to both of you.

178
00:17:42,870 --> 00:17:46,820
With both of your strengths, you're not a match with those 7 people.

179
00:17:46,820 --> 00:17:51,090
- I'll block them. Both of you leave quickly!  - I'm not leaving.

180
00:17:51,090 --> 00:17:56,960
Fire General, you are wanted now. The known doors are not easy to enter now.

181
00:17:56,960 --> 00:18:01,240
I know some secret doors.

182
00:18:01,240 --> 00:18:04,190
It's all on this sheet of paper that I'm slipping to you.

183
00:18:04,190 --> 00:18:07,700
Remember, the next spirit tree that's going to undergo Qi Ming,

184
00:18:07,700 --> 00:18:11,550
will be the Bodhi tree in Yulin Street.

185
00:18:11,550 --> 00:18:13,800
We're only killing Cao Yan Bing.

186
00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:16,810
Go quickly. Otherwise, you won't have a chance!

187
00:18:22,910 --> 00:18:24,630
I'm not leaving!

188
00:18:30,560 --> 00:18:33,500
Old Ghost! I'm helping you!

189
00:18:36,530 --> 00:18:39,240
Cao Yan Bing. Ghost...

190
00:18:42,760 --> 00:18:45,950
Take both of them away. Don't return.

191
00:19:10,010 --> 00:19:16,890
 Timing and Subtitles brought by The Spiritual Guardians @ Viki  

192
00:19:19,680 --> 00:19:22,820
Finally, I don't need to pretend anymore.

193
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:28,830
Before dying, do you have any last words?

194
00:19:28,830 --> 00:19:31,600
You..who are you?

195
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:37,960
A headless guardian spirit, Giant Axe, God of War, Xing Tian?

196
00:19:37,960 --> 00:19:41,370
You..you're Huangfu Longdou

197
00:19:43,260 --> 00:19:46,100
Huangfu Longdou

198
00:19:47,470 --> 00:19:50,660
Sounds like a good last word.

199
00:19:50,660 --> 00:19:56,280
This is your graveyard.

200
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:01,950
 Cao Yan Bing has already mastered the skill of breath. 

201
00:20:01,950 --> 00:20:07,310
 The sleeping tiger has finally awaken. 

202
00:20:08,900 --> 00:20:12,810
 You are arrogant, cocky, your whole body is covered with the smell of terminal straight men cancer, male dominance. 

203
00:20:12,810 --> 00:20:16,230
  You never considered other's opinions. You never trusted your own partner! 

204
00:20:16,230 --> 00:20:20,330
 If I continue to stay in the mortal realm, will this heart chain still have a chance to break? 

205
00:20:20,330 --> 00:20:23,990
 He is known as Silver Spear Master, Zhao Xin. 

206
00:20:23,990 --> 00:20:25,350
 We should just kill you as a precaution! 

207
00:20:25,350 --> 00:20:26,990
  Be careful! 

208
00:20:29,170 --> 00:20:32,050
Start.

209
00:20:32,050 --> 00:20:34,300
Expose your arm a bit.

210
00:20:36,110 --> 00:20:38,000
3, 2, 1, start.    Anthomaniac girl 

211
00:20:39,610 --> 00:20:44,910
 Selfie-addict 

212
00:20:46,790 --> 00:20:48,080
 So tiring 

213
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:49,820
Alright, cut.

214
00:20:49,820 --> 00:20:52,570
- Thanks for the hard work.   - Thanks for the hard work.

215
00:20:52,570 --> 00:20:53,950
 Finally done 

216
00:20:55,940 --> 00:20:58,760
Through the corner of my eyes, I saw the expressions of you all like this...

217
00:21:00,860 --> 00:21:03,910
Two of us here...

218
00:21:03,910 --> 00:21:05,280
It's not recorded.

219
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:07,530
No, he is recording.

220
00:21:10,440 --> 00:21:12,200
It's so heavy.

221
00:21:13,350 --> 00:21:18,420
This is my guardian spirit, Xu Chu's Huge Chru Mace.

222
00:21:19,770 --> 00:21:22,080
I hit myself.

223
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:24,820
Xu Chu, what are you doing? Rude!

224
00:21:26,230 --> 00:21:27,300
 Need medicine 

225
00:21:31,020 --> 00:21:37,750
♬  When earth and heaven become blurred, the beautiful becomes demonic,  ♬

226
00:21:37,750 --> 00:21:44,500
♬  swallowing the maelstrom of the soul's desires  ♬

227
00:21:44,500 --> 00:21:50,080
♬  You ask me why I still persist,  ♬

228
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:59,930
♬  why I don't surrender to the shining, golden shackles  ♬

229
00:21:59,930 --> 00:22:06,420
♬  Even when everyone has been reduced to a powerless puppet,  ♬

230
00:22:06,420 --> 00:22:12,410
♬  we cannot give up our world to those flashy, hypocritical scum  ♬

231
00:22:12,410 --> 00:22:15,460
♬  Throw away your fears and prepare your strength  ♬

232
00:22:15,460 --> 00:22:19,160
♬  Even if the heavens don't distinguish right from wrong,  ♬

233
00:22:19,160 --> 00:22:25,280
♬  I vow to forever protect the fortress of our freedom,   ♬

234
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:28,440
♬   without giving in  ♬

235
00:22:28,440 --> 00:22:31,640
♬   I will become a monument of a hero.  ♬

236
00:22:31,640 --> 00:22:39,150
♬  Take all of our sins and burn them to ashes  ♬

237
00:22:39,150 --> 00:22:45,800
♬  Too many people have already become puppets under their control  ♬

238
00:22:45,800 --> 00:22:52,270
♬  Even when everyone has been reduced to a powerless puppet,  ♬

239
00:22:52,270 --> 00:22:58,230
♬  we cannot give up our world to those flashy, hypocritical scum  ♬

240
00:22:58,230 --> 00:23:01,280
