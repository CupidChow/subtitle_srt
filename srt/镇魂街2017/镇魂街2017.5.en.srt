Timing and Subtitles brought to you by The Spiritual Guardians @ Viki

2
00:00:09,730 --> 00:00:11,800
Who exactly are you?

3
00:00:12,810 --> 00:00:17,640
Who I am is not important. The most important thing is

4
00:00:18,490 --> 00:00:23,650
the things I said about the spirit pagoda tree are true.

5
00:00:25,250 --> 00:00:29,980
I'm not deceiving Fire general.

6
00:00:31,400 --> 00:00:36,300
Forget it. I don't need to talk so much with someone who only dares to show up with a mask like you.

7
00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:41,290
but I have a way to make you confess.

8
00:00:41,290 --> 00:00:45,910
I'm really not deceiving Fire general.

9
00:00:51,750 --> 00:00:56,810
I'm really not deceiving Fire general.

10
00:02:06,670 --> 00:02:10,230
Rakshasa Street

11
00:02:10,230 --> 00:02:12,130
Episode 5

12
00:02:20,010 --> 00:02:22,550
Doesn't even have one that catch your eyes?

13
00:02:25,700 --> 00:02:30,710
Mama, you started to be busy in arranging blind dates for me when I haven't graduated yet. Are you a bit too exaggerated?

14
00:02:30,710 --> 00:02:31,980
I'm not exaggerated.

15
00:02:31,980 --> 00:02:35,630
Did you not hear before? We can't let children lose at the starting line.

16
00:02:35,630 --> 00:02:39,340
Your marriage can't lose at the starting line too.

17
00:02:39,340 --> 00:02:43,520
Papa, shouldn't you stop Mama's mischief?

18
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:47,510
Your Ma said that I'm the first man that makes you lose at the starting line.

19
00:02:47,510 --> 00:02:51,250
Second,... I have no more right to say anything much.

20
00:02:51,250 --> 00:02:54,360
Ling Ling, I and your Pa were walking around the streets.

21
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:56,230
This big city is too costly.

22
00:02:56,230 --> 00:02:57,790
Better go back to our hometown.

23
00:02:57,790 --> 00:03:00,520
Go back to hometown and pass the civil service exam. It's stable.

24
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:05,870
Either you go to work at a public institution like bank, it's easy.

25
00:03:05,870 --> 00:03:08,460
Now it's the golden stage of your life,

26
00:03:08,460 --> 00:03:10,300
you can't waste your time.

27
00:03:10,300 --> 00:03:12,320
Aiya.

28
00:03:20,460 --> 00:03:24,170
Brother, your appetite is good today.

29
00:03:26,010 --> 00:03:29,970
I lost my sense of taste from being beaten. So I'll take this chance to eat more.

30
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:35,020
Uncle Ghost, you are so awesome.

31
00:03:35,020 --> 00:03:39,610
Besides sister Xia Ling, you're the first person I've seen to beat my brother tragically.

32
00:03:39,610 --> 00:03:43,120
But my brother never hit a girl

33
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:45,720
so sister Xia Ling can't be considered awesome.

34
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:50,980
But you're different. I sense my brother wants to knock you down very badly.

35
00:03:50,980 --> 00:03:55,970
I deeply admire Fire General's fighting spirit.

36
00:03:55,970 --> 00:04:01,080
But he couldn’t knock you down.

37
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:07,900
That’s why I said I deeply admire Fire General’s fighting spirit.

38
00:04:07,900 --> 00:04:11,040
Yesterday, I just experienced a war

39
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:13,650
and didn’t eat breakfast. That’s called being seriously hurt before healing.

40
00:04:13,650 --> 00:04:16,680
But don’t worry. There will be a fight between us.

41
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:18,640
I’m not done with you.

42
00:04:18,640 --> 00:04:20,240
Oh?

43
00:04:21,430 --> 00:04:29,530
Like I said, Fire General’s fighting spirit really makes others admire deeply.

44
00:04:30,610 --> 00:04:34,880
Brother,I don’t think Uncle Ghost is a bad person.

45
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:36,440
Don’t compete with him anymore.

46
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:38,230
You said

47
00:04:38,930 --> 00:04:41,610
everything you’ve said is true.

48
00:04:41,610 --> 00:04:43,370
Right.

49
00:04:43,370 --> 00:04:48,230
I think Fire General also realize that I’m not deceiving you.

50
00:04:48,230 --> 00:04:53,570
I won't say the things I don't want to say.

51
00:04:54,950 --> 00:04:56,810
Solo duel!

52
00:05:09,670 --> 00:05:12,140
Didn’t you say you will help me regain the spirit pagoda tree?

53
00:05:12,140 --> 00:05:16,540
How? Do you know where?

54
00:05:22,990 --> 00:05:27,940
Of course. But I can’t tell you now.

55
00:05:27,940 --> 00:05:28,980
Why not?

56
00:05:28,980 --> 00:05:30,920
I know your personality.

57
00:05:30,920 --> 00:05:35,280
You’ll revenge if there’s hatred. I won’t temporarily speak of the spirit pagoda tree situation.

58
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:41,350
Just consider about the beam ten years ago, you would also take your weapon and run towards the point straight.

59
00:05:41,350 --> 00:05:44,100
What, it shouldn't be like that?

60
00:05:44,100 --> 00:05:48,700
I'm reminding Fire General. Don't forget the hard battle last night.

61
00:05:48,700 --> 00:05:52,050
Although you defeated Dao Jin Yi Hong,

62
00:05:52,050 --> 00:05:56,680
but his spirit host hasn’t participated in the fight.

63
00:05:57,360 --> 00:06:02,510
Just imagine when you confront 3 spirit hosts like Dao Jin Yi Hong,

64
00:06:02,510 --> 00:06:06,700
do you think you can win for sure?

65
00:06:07,690 --> 00:06:11,050
So if you begin your journey now,

66
00:06:11,050 --> 00:06:16,050
not only can you not regain the spirit pagoda tree, you’ll also lose your life.

67
00:06:16,050 --> 00:06:19,440
Since I said I would help Fire General regain the spirit pagoda tree,

68
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:24,180
of course I can’t tell you the location of the spirit pagoda tree now.

69
00:06:24,980 --> 00:06:29,120
Didn’t you always say you’re an awesome person?

70
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:32,980
Then how come you’re not going? Why bother staying here and being so annoying?

71
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:38,210
Naturally, I have my own purpose.

72
00:06:38,210 --> 00:06:42,980
It’s just not convenient to tell Fire General now.

73
00:06:43,550 --> 00:06:45,290
Solo duel!

74
00:06:53,950 --> 00:06:58,530
Mom. Don’t tell me that having stability and relaxation are the most important things in life.

75
00:06:58,530 --> 00:07:00,260
Could it be being unsettled and bitterly tired?

76
00:07:00,260 --> 00:07:03,110
Then not going home, I must be unsettled and bitterly tired?

77
00:07:03,110 --> 00:07:04,630
Maybe

78
00:07:04,630 --> 00:07:08,720
But going home, you’ll surely be stable and relaxed.

79
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:11,520
One side is uncertain, the other is certain. Who do you choose?

80
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:13,980
It’s absolutely not the same.

81
00:07:13,980 --> 00:07:15,580
Houses are so expensive.

82
00:07:15,580 --> 00:07:18,410
In downtown, the average price also needs at least fifty thousand per square meter.

83
00:07:18,410 --> 00:07:20,890
In countryside also needs at least thirty thousand per square meter.

84
00:07:20,890 --> 00:07:22,980
Look at you. You can't rent an apartment.

85
00:07:22,980 --> 00:07:26,240
Let say your monthly salary is 4500. It's not low for a fresh graduate, right?

86
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:28,180
But by then it reaches your hand, it's not even 4000.

87
00:07:28,180 --> 00:07:30,520
Rent a house for 1000, you have 3000 left.

88
00:07:30,520 --> 00:07:32,680
Every month you have to eat and pay bills.

89
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:35,930
Phone bill, internet fee, cosmetics, clothing, socializing...

90
00:07:35,930 --> 00:07:37,520
It's not even enough for your monthly expenses.

91
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:39,540
This will force you to become parasite single.

92
00:07:39,540 --> 00:07:41,960
Forcing you to become parasite single means forcing you to depend on us.

93
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:43,750
Are you complaining that we're not old enough?

94
00:07:43,750 --> 00:07:46,050
You depend on us until we are old, you need to raise us by then.

95
00:07:46,050 --> 00:07:49,650
You can't even raise yourself, how are you going to raise us?

96
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:11,260
Fine.

97
00:08:11,890 --> 00:08:17,550
Tell me. What is your plan to regain the spirit pagoda tree?

98
00:08:17,550 --> 00:08:23,750
2 points. First, Fire General must enhance your strength,

99
00:08:23,750 --> 00:08:27,310
especially this piece of the guardian spirit.

100
00:08:27,310 --> 00:08:30,150
You've never summoned the guardian spirit,

101
00:08:30,150 --> 00:08:34,280
only using your own energy to dominate Rakshasa street, acting as a spirit host.

102
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:37,550
Your combat power is naturally first class,

103
00:08:37,550 --> 00:08:40,130
but everyone knows

104
00:08:40,130 --> 00:08:45,270
the battle between the spirit hosts is actually a battle between the guardian spirits.

105
00:08:45,270 --> 00:08:51,190
This point. I can help you.

106
00:08:51,190 --> 00:08:52,970
The second point?

107
00:08:54,180 --> 00:08:59,540
You must bring Miss Xia Ling along with us on the journey.

108
00:08:59,540 --> 00:09:02,930
You must bring her.

109
00:09:02,930 --> 00:09:06,270
- Solo duel?   - That's right. Solo duel!

110
00:09:09,050 --> 00:09:10,660
This one.

111
00:09:12,490 --> 00:09:14,090
This one.

112
00:09:14,090 --> 00:09:16,680
And take look at this one.

113
00:09:19,020 --> 00:09:20,240
How is it?

114
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:25,150
Are you thinking that you are too young, so not that thoughtful in many things?

115
00:09:25,150 --> 00:09:27,470
The person you liked the most, Jay Chou ( Taiwanese singer)  already said,

116
00:09:27,470 --> 00:09:29,520
You have to listen to me.

117
00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:33,140
This is too much like living for the sake of surving...

118
00:09:33,140 --> 00:09:35,820
Wolfberry? What wolfberry?  (Wolfberry - Gou Qi in Chinese)

119
00:09:35,820 --> 00:09:38,180
Look at these men closely.

120
00:09:38,180 --> 00:09:40,860
I said whatever you said are all for the sake of remaining alive, are all trifles, too much careful planning,

121
00:09:40,860 --> 00:09:44,260
mediocrity without any technical content, are all for the sake of surviving, not living.

122
00:09:44,260 --> 00:09:47,130
Mama, life is not all about surviving, there are still poem and distance. (There's more to the picture than meets the eye.)

123
00:09:47,130 --> 00:09:50,570
I'm telling the reality, you're telling me the ideal.

124
00:09:50,570 --> 00:09:53,280
I'm telling you principles, you're telling me chicken soup.

125
00:09:53,280 --> 00:09:56,840
Ok, what is poem? What again is distance?

126
00:09:56,840 --> 00:09:58,640
My forty years of experience,

127
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:02,600
I tell you there's no poem, and no even distance.

128
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:04,170
I'm poem!

129
00:10:04,170 --> 00:10:06,260
I'm distance!

130
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:18,800
Poem, and even Distance? Two mad people, messed up with me for what?

131
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:23,000
Also, you don't even go back to our hometown but you're staying here.

132
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:27,800
Is this poem and distance? This at most is just surviving at the distance.

133
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:30,400
Ma, I'm not surviving at the distance.

134
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:33,600
I'm stepping up against injustice!

135
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:38,100
Also, your dad doesn't even listen to me talk; he only knows how to eat.

136
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:41,180
Old Xia.

137
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,300
Old Xia!

138
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,400
Old Xia!

139
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:51,500
Mom, I know where dad is.

140
00:10:57,800 --> 00:10:59,600
Where is this place?

141
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:01,800
Where is this?

142
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:05,000
Dad.

143
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,700
- Old Xia!   - Let go of me!

144
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:23,700
Ling Ling. Quickly take your mother and run!

145
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:26,000
Dad.

146
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,200
Hey!

147
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:43,400
You must come out. I'm handing it over to you this time.

148
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:03,300
Guardian spirit!

149
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:39,200
I'm beaten like this.

150
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:41,900
Why hasn't the guardian spirit appeared?

151
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:08,400
[ Li Xuan Yuan ]

152
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:11,400
So handsome

153
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:14,600
I'm sorry Master. I was locked by the lock heart chain

154
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:18,000
so I can't be the same as other guardian spirits and come out easily.

155
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:43,600
Why did he disappeared?

156
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:48,300
Dad! Mom!

157
00:13:49,350 --> 00:13:51,220
Mom! Mom!

158
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:56,800
Dad! Dad!

159
00:14:01,700 --> 00:14:03,300
Guardian spirit

160
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:09,400
Guardian spirit!

161
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:12,600
Guardian spirit, how come you didn't come out this time?!

162
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:14,400
Dad! Dad!

163
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:22,200
Stupid girl. The guardian spirit isn't working. Try calling a substitute.

164
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:24,500
- How about it?  - Cao Yan Bing!

165
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:33,200
Cao Yan Bing! Save my mom and dad!

166
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:41,000
Xu Chu

167
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:16,500
Where is he?

168
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:21,800
Your brother's general chain rung so he left.

169
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:25,670
12345

170
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:27,900
6

171
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:42,000
Brother, what kind of strange person did you meet?

172
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,400
I didn't meet a strange person.

173
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:48,410
She is absolutely not a person.

174
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:55,800
Remembering too many things will become a burden in life.

175
00:15:55,800 --> 00:15:58,500
It's better to delete a memory that isn't needed.

176
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,800
What are you doing?

177
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:04,400
Open the brain to erase the memory.

178
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:08,200
Do you want them to remember those scary evil faces after they wake up?

179
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,300
What are you doing?

180
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:19,600
What are you doing?

181
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:21,350
It's your turn.

182
00:16:21,350 --> 00:16:23,500
You also want to open my brain?

183
00:16:23,500 --> 00:16:25,000
Of course.

184
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:28,600
I'm also a spirit host. What's your reason for erasing my memory?

185
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:31,400
Remembering too many things will be a burden in life.

186
00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:35,100
It's better to delete a memory that isn't needed.

187
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:45,500
This place is...

188
00:16:45,500 --> 00:16:48,200
This is Xia Ling's spirit host space.

189
00:16:49,370 --> 00:16:51,200
You are Xia Ling's spirit host?

190
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:54,600
Right. I'm Li Xuanyuan

191
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:58,200
You probably won't stop me from opening Xia Ling's brain, right?

192
00:16:58,200 --> 00:17:00,400
I can't let you erase Master's memory.

193
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:03,000
She can have an ordinary human life.

194
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,400
Once she's involved with the disputes of the spirit world, the gains don't make up for the losses.

195
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:08,600
You're Xia Ling's guardian spirit. You don't understand this principle?

196
00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:13,800
The human world is good. The spirit world is also good.

197
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:17,200
The spirit host exists between these two worlds.

198
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:19,600
I respect my master.

199
00:17:20,800 --> 00:17:24,000
If she wants to return to live in the human world one day,

200
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:27,800
even if there’s a requiem hand who wants to drag her back,

201
00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:31,200
I'll cut it off.

202
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:34,200
Then why was it when I opened her mind the first time,

203
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:36,000
you didn't stop me?

204
00:17:36,930 --> 00:17:39,410
That was when I first woke up.

205
00:17:40,190 --> 00:17:42,380
Then the tunnel that time,

206
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:45,400
became the junction of the requiem streets and the human world.

207
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:49,900
When Xia Ling was in danger then, you inhaled the guardian spirit air

208
00:17:50,980 --> 00:17:53,060
So she revived you.

209
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,000
Your body at that time,

210
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,000
Lock heart chain

211
00:18:01,800 --> 00:18:04,400
Cao Yan Bing!

212
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:05,400
Stop while you can

213
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:07,400
What's wrong? You want to hit a woman?

214
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:10,200
I told you before that I don't hit woman.

215
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:30,800
So Xia Ling's spirit guardian was locked by a chain.

216
00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:32,800
So he can't casually appear right?

217
00:18:32,800 --> 00:18:36,600
Kill the enemy, not the spirit. Beating the teammate is professional.

218
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:39,300
A captured, weak girl asked me to save her.

219
00:18:39,300 --> 00:18:42,600
I was beaten by a girl who asked for my protection. Are you sure you want to bring her along?

220
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:44,400
- I'm certain.   - Reason?

221
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:48,400
Because Miss Xia's spirit guardian is really strong.

222
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:50,600
I think Fire General--

223
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:52,400
I think Fire General should be aware.

224
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:56,000
What's the point of being strong? He can't even come out.

225
00:18:57,100 --> 00:18:59,800
I will be in charge of training.

226
00:18:59,800 --> 00:19:02,000
This, Fire General--

227
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,800
No need to worry.

228
00:19:03,800 --> 00:19:07,500
That's right, Brother. Just agree and let Sister Xia Ling go with us.

229
00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:10,000
You see even Tang monk's pilgrimage for buddhist scriptures also has four people.

230
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:13,100
-I don't agree. -Why?

231
00:19:16,600 --> 00:19:19,800
- All over your body is... - the lock heart chain

232
00:19:44,030 --> 00:19:47,000
Owner, I'm here.

233
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:55,400
Am I... in my dreams?

234
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,100
Yes.

235
00:19:58,100 --> 00:20:03,000
This is the spirit host space inside your body. It's the area of the guardian spirit.

236
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:06,800
You can come close to talk to me.

237
00:20:06,800 --> 00:20:10,200
I'm chained by the lock heart chain so I can't move freely.

238
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:12,100
Oh, okay.

239
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:16,200
Why am I so nervous?

240
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:21,000
That's right, he's my spirit guardian. Why am I nervous for?

241
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,500
Similar.

242
00:20:43,020 --> 00:20:44,850
Very similar.

243
00:20:45,800 --> 00:20:49,790
I didn't expect I've been separated for a century. I can still see you.

244
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:53,400
Is this fate?

245
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:57,600
I... look like someone?

246
00:20:57,600 --> 00:20:58,900
Yes.

247
00:21:00,150 --> 00:21:01,740
You are similar.

248
00:21:02,800 --> 00:21:05,400
Is she your ex?

249
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:08,900
In some ways, she's considered that.

250
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:16,000
This can't be it. Those old ways of getting a girl.

251
00:21:17,590 --> 00:21:20,840
Seeing that he's a good person, I'll forgive him.

252
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:23,800
Then who is she?

253
00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:26,400
She is the daughter of an aristocratic family, Mu Wen.

254
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:29,200
A beauty who can cause the downfall of a city

255
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:33,600
She is your ancestor, Mu Wen Yuan Xiang.

256
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:36,400
Mu Wen Yuan Xiang

257
00:21:40,870 --> 00:21:44,410
The aristocratic Mu Wen family is an ancient clan

258
00:21:45,770 --> 00:21:48,800
who created the world-famous bells.

259
00:21:51,100 --> 00:21:53,990
That year, I followed Master’s orders to go down the mountain.

260
00:21:53,990 --> 00:21:57,200
to pray to the spirits of the aristocratic Mu Wen family.

261
00:21:57,200 --> 00:22:01,260
I unintentionally met her in the courtyard.

262
00:22:03,670 --> 00:22:07,410
Even though the distance was very far, I can smell

263
00:22:07,410 --> 00:22:10,560
a special kind of jasmine fragrance on her.

264
00:22:13,560 --> 00:22:16,730
Afterwards, we were attracted to each other

265
00:22:16,730 --> 00:22:19,260
and fell in love.

266
00:22:19,260 --> 00:22:22,910
Currently, your body also has this jasmine fragrance.

267
00:22:26,450 --> 00:22:28,930
Are both of you my parents?

268
00:22:28,930 --> 00:22:33,580
No, master. We only held hands,

269
00:22:33,580 --> 00:22:37,000
walked around, didn't...

270
00:22:41,630 --> 00:22:45,700
Could my ancestor be so reserved?

271
00:22:45,700 --> 00:22:48,240
Did he see wrong?

272
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:52,600
It's a pity. A good thing doesn't last forever.

273
00:22:52,600 --> 00:22:54,950
Yuan Xiang suddenly caught a bad disease.

274
00:22:54,950 --> 00:22:58,540
No doctor could save her.

275
00:22:59,160 --> 00:23:04,320
The great experts couldn't find a solution. But I knew of a way to save Yuan Xiang,

276
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:08,130
which was the instrument of Master, the Exorcism Breeze.

277
00:23:38,450 --> 00:23:40,220
Xuan Yuan.

278
00:23:46,860 --> 00:23:48,480
Master.

279
00:23:50,710 --> 00:23:53,710
I have told you before,

280
00:23:58,680 --> 00:24:02,060
It's not because I don't want to save Yuan Xiang.

281
00:24:10,350 --> 00:24:12,360
Disciple knows.

282
00:24:13,670 --> 00:24:18,640
But I've already made up my mind. If Yuan Xiang can't be saved,

283
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:21,310
I'll die of illness with her

284
00:24:22,700 --> 00:24:25,450
- and accompany her.   - You--

285
00:24:26,600 --> 00:24:28,700
Master,

286
00:24:28,700 --> 00:24:32,700
disciple is unfaithful but

287
00:24:35,290 --> 00:24:39,140
letting me see her being ill day by day,

288
00:24:39,140 --> 00:24:42,470
I... can't do it!

289
00:24:49,040 --> 00:24:50,810
Stop!

290
00:24:54,520 --> 00:25:00,140
Forget it, since... since you're willing

291
00:25:00,140 --> 00:25:02,640
Since everything is decided by the heavens,

292
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:07,470
I can help you save her.

293
00:25:07,470 --> 00:25:12,160
But first bring out the seniors.

294
00:26:04,980 --> 00:26:06,610
You woke up?

295
00:26:06,610 --> 00:26:10,170
I didn't tell her I don't have much time left to live.

296
00:26:10,890 --> 00:26:15,340
Those days, were the happiest days in my life.

297
00:26:56,460 --> 00:27:00,520
On the 9th night, I decided to secretly leave.

298
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:35,310
Yue Xiang.

299
00:27:35,940 --> 00:27:37,580
Yue Xiang.

300
00:27:45,530 --> 00:27:48,900
We've underestimated her contagious disease.

301
00:27:57,840 --> 00:28:02,720
That will only temporary control her illness.

302
00:28:06,430 --> 00:28:10,570
You don't have much time left to live.

303
00:28:15,850 --> 00:28:20,010
Now, there is only one way

304
00:28:20,010 --> 00:28:22,820
that can save you both.

305
00:28:22,820 --> 00:28:24,570
What method?

306
00:28:30,990 --> 00:28:35,520
Afterwards, become the guardian spirit of Mu Wen Yuan Xiang.

307
00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:38,290
Spirit Guardian.

310

Li Xuan Yan,

311
00:28:52,730 --> 00:28:55,730
This street, you're the one in charge.

312
00:28:58,210 --> 00:28:59,910
Master.

313
00:29:12,900 --> 00:29:14,710
Do you think he can handle it?

314
00:29:23,270 --> 00:29:24,750
Start.

315
00:29:29,270 --> 00:29:32,010
Okay, that's good.

316
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:41,930
3, 2, 1, start.

317
00:30:04,680 --> 00:30:07,760

318
00:30:07,760 --> 00:30:10,100
You're Xia Ling's spirit guardian?
