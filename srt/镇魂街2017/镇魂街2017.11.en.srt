00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:13,700
What is this place?

3
00:00:13,700 --> 00:00:15,790
Paradise.

4
00:00:41,230 --> 00:00:44,740
[ Ming Jing Village ]

5
00:00:44,740 --> 00:00:46,490
Ming Jing Village.

6
00:00:46,490 --> 00:00:48,450
Can you read it?

7
00:00:48,450 --> 00:00:50,490
It's just Qin Zhuan.   (Qin Zhuan - an ancient style of calligraphy adopted in the Qin dynasty)

8
00:00:53,620 --> 00:00:56,620
Seems like very well-educated.

9
00:02:33,630 --> 00:02:37,250
Rakshasa Street

00:02:37,250 --> 00:02:39,240
Episode 11

11
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:48,490
Cao Yan Bing, is that a Bodhi Tree?

12
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:51,930
It seems to be taller than your house's Sacred Pagoda Tree.

13
00:02:51,930 --> 00:02:55,080
In an unfamilar place, we must be more vigilant.

14
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:57,340
Ask your man be awake all the time.

15
00:03:02,010 --> 00:03:05,280
-Li Xuan Yuan.  -Master, I'm here.

16
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:13,000
Let me out. Let me out.

17
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,300
-Let me out. -Outside is very dangerous.

18
00:03:15,300 --> 00:03:16,730
If you go out, you will be beaten to death.

19
00:03:16,730 --> 00:03:19,390
- Let me out!   - Master Nan and Master Men has exhorted us repeatedly.

20
00:03:19,390 --> 00:03:21,430
He doesn't let us go out. Did you forget it all?

21
00:03:21,430 --> 00:03:23,100
I don't care whoever Master Nan or Master Men.

22
00:03:23,100 --> 00:03:25,850
Master Nan is coming soon, you just wait for him for a little while more.

23
00:03:25,850 --> 00:03:28,440
Let me go out, let me go out!

24
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:29,760
There's outsiders!

25
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:32,210
-Hi. -Hello.

26
00:03:32,210 --> 00:03:36,620
We are here for the first time. Excuse me...

27
00:03:36,620 --> 00:03:38,800
Outsiders?

28
00:03:39,690 --> 00:03:40,870
Demons.

29
00:03:40,870 --> 00:03:42,690
Demons!

30
00:03:43,300 --> 00:03:46,270
- Demons! Hurry and run!    - Hey, hey, hey

31
00:03:49,900 --> 00:03:51,290
Hurry, hurry.

32
00:03:53,630 --> 00:03:55,150
Uh...

33
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:01,100
Little girl, everyone ran away. Why haven't you run away yet?

34
00:04:01,100 --> 00:04:04,220
Are you guys demons?

35
00:04:06,590 --> 00:04:11,870
That's right, we are really scary demons who eat people. Rawr!

36
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:15,920
It's hurts...

37
00:04:19,820 --> 00:04:21,660
Little girl, you see,

38
00:04:21,660 --> 00:04:25,550
Sister looks so cute. How can I be a demon?

39
00:04:27,620 --> 00:04:30,270
Big brother, big sister, did you come from the outside village?

40
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:34,550
When you guys came, did you see another girl like me?

41
00:04:34,550 --> 00:04:36,930
Her skin is white, her eyes are big,

42
00:04:36,930 --> 00:04:39,860
She's wearing a big clothing that's red.

43
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:44,620
Does she have a mole on her side?

44
00:04:44,620 --> 00:04:47,180
That's right, it's her. Her name is Shui'er and she's sick.

45
00:04:47,180 --> 00:04:49,590
She went outside of the village. I have to find her and bring her back.

46
00:04:49,590 --> 00:04:53,600
Her body is originally weak. If she goes outside and get's caught by a demon, she'll get eaten.

47
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:55,670
Why is it a demon again?

48
00:04:56,770 --> 00:05:01,380
Little girl, this big brother will take you out to see her but are you willing to leave the village?

49
00:05:01,380 --> 00:05:03,380
I dare to. Shui'er is my best friend,

50
00:05:03,380 --> 00:05:06,980
even thought if I get eaten by a demon, I'll still find her and bring her back.

51
00:05:09,110 --> 00:05:11,150
Gou'er! Gou'er! Hurry up come over here!

52
00:05:11,150 --> 00:05:13,890
They're people from the outside village. They're probably demons!

53
00:05:13,890 --> 00:05:17,780
Demons?! I'm so pretty, how can you call me a demon?

54
00:05:17,780 --> 00:05:20,490
But that lady doesn't look like a demon.

55
00:05:20,490 --> 00:05:22,760
Maybe she is a fox-spirit.

56
00:05:22,760 --> 00:05:23,720
You look at that guy.

57
00:05:23,730 --> 00:05:26,580
Maybe he is a racoon-spirit.

58
00:05:26,580 --> 00:05:29,100
Why must be a racoon-spirit?

59
00:05:29,100 --> 00:05:32,150
Big brother, big sister, I beg you; bring me to find Xue'er.

60
00:05:32,150 --> 00:05:35,580
Her body is originally weak, if she faints at outside the village...

61
00:05:35,580 --> 00:05:39,260
Cao Yan Bing, why don't you take his little girl so go find her friend.

62
00:05:39,260 --> 00:05:40,870
- I'll take care of this.   - You?!

63
00:05:40,870 --> 00:05:43,700
Don't worry, my man is awake.

64
00:05:43,700 --> 00:05:46,860
- Li Xuan Yuan.   -  Master, I'm here.

65
00:05:46,860 --> 00:05:49,440
Did you hear that? He said that he is here.

66
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:51,280
Obviously only you can hear him.

67
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:53,130
Don't talk nonsense anymore, hurry and bring her away.

68
00:05:53,130 --> 00:05:54,730
Here.

69
00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:57,510
Be careful.

70
00:06:01,250 --> 00:06:04,740
Dear fellow folks, please listen to me.

71
00:06:05,630 --> 00:06:11,410
Why do I feel this is like some scene in the Anti-Japanese TV series?

72
00:06:12,210 --> 00:06:15,030
That... Dear fellow folks,

73
00:06:15,030 --> 00:06:16,630
please trust me.

74
00:06:16,630 --> 00:06:19,800
We two are just like all of you,

75
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:21,650
are both living human.

76
00:06:21,650 --> 00:06:24,960
You see?

77
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:27,300
So please don't worry,

78
00:06:27,300 --> 00:06:31,630
My friend will bring both little girls back peacefully.

79
00:06:31,630 --> 00:06:35,330
I'll stay here to be hostage, ok?

00:06:45,730 --> 00:06:47,090
Bai...

82
00:06:47,090 --> 00:06:49,680
Shi Men...

83
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:51,920
Is she sick?

84
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:55,160
Bai Shi Men...

85
00:06:56,610 --> 00:06:58,640
Bai Shi Men...

86
00:06:58,640 --> 00:06:59,730
Something white.   (White in chinese is Bai)

87
00:06:59,730 --> 00:07:02,090
Something white...

88
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:09,000
Sorry, let me pass.

89
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,150
Let me pass.

90
00:07:10,150 --> 00:07:11,490
Shui'er. Shui'er.

91
00:07:11,490 --> 00:07:13,220
Who is he? What does this person do?

92
00:07:13,220 --> 00:07:15,660
How did he just...?

93
00:07:15,660 --> 00:07:17,590
He carried her away.

94
00:07:30,640 --> 00:07:32,000
Cao Yan Bing, you came back?

95
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,740
Your man is at work?

96
00:07:33,740 --> 00:07:35,630
Of course.

97
00:07:51,110 --> 00:07:55,260
Bai Shi Men...

98
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:02,960
What is she calling? Something Shi Men.

99
00:08:03,590 --> 00:08:05,780
I only know about Bei Luo Shi Men.

100
00:08:05,780 --> 00:08:07,660
What is it?

101
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:13,180
There's a star in the sky and a monkey on the ground.

102
00:08:13,180 --> 00:08:15,450
What the heck is that?

103
00:08:15,450 --> 00:08:17,540
Monkey?

104
00:08:48,410 --> 00:08:54,130
The appearance of Sacred Pagoda Branch, proved that the time of Qi Ming of spirit trees computed in the Book of Heaven is correct.

105
00:08:54,130 --> 00:08:57,030
The Book of Heaven that was being stolen 10 years ago?

106
00:08:57,030 --> 00:09:02,700
This is it. But that few guys who were anxious to render a deed of merit didn't understand.

107
00:09:02,700 --> 00:09:08,320
They attacked at the wrong timing, and died together with Cao Yan Bing's guardian spirit, Yu Jin.

108
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:14,020
Because the time of appearance of Sacred Pagoda Branch does not rely on one book only.

109
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:57,360
When the southest bright star, Bei Luo Shi Men is dimming,

110
00:09:57,360 --> 00:10:01,260
the Bodhi Tree will produce the Supreme Fruit.

111
00:10:15,950 --> 00:10:17,700
How is it?

112
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:22,930
The evil spirits team under Plough Dragoon General has all been killed by Bei Luo Shi Men.

113
00:10:22,930 --> 00:10:28,070
Master Man indeed deserved to be the Guardian God of Yulin Street.

114
00:10:28,070 --> 00:10:32,930
There's also another issue. Cao Yan Bing, already reached Mingjing Village.

115
00:10:36,490 --> 00:10:39,400
This is beyond my imagination.

116
00:10:46,690 --> 00:10:51,030
I want water.

117
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:03,290
They are...

118
00:11:03,290 --> 00:11:05,000
You went outside the village.

119
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:08,960
I couldn't stop you. It's this big brother who saved you.

120
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:11,200
Run to the outside village?

121
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:15,130
Why did I go outside the village? It's so dangerous outside.

122
00:11:15,130 --> 00:11:20,060
How would I know? Once you fall ill, you are like possessed by demon.

123
00:11:20,060 --> 00:11:22,800
Then, thank you, big brother, for saving me.

124
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:28,160
But if I I went outside the village and met a demon, I probably would've already been eaten.

125
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:30,900
Do you not remember anything?

126
00:11:32,300 --> 00:11:35,040
Why do the people from outside say the people inside or demons?

127
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:37,000
And why are the people on the inside saying the outside people are demons?

128
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,100
What?

129
00:11:38,100 --> 00:11:39,580
I asked why the outside--

130
00:11:39,580 --> 00:11:41,360
Is outside really scary?

131
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:44,990
It's super scary. Master Nan and Master Men have said

132
00:11:44,990 --> 00:11:48,150
The world outside, demons run rampant, they eat people.

133
00:11:48,150 --> 00:11:51,970
They especially like to eat children. He told us to never go outside.

134
00:11:51,970 --> 00:11:56,120
Our illness was infected by someone who went outside the village and got caught by a demon.

135
00:11:56,120 --> 00:11:59,090
After they came back, it infected others.

136
00:11:59,090 --> 00:12:00,350
Master Men?

137
00:12:00,350 --> 00:12:02,980
Yes, he is a big good man just like Master Nan.

138
00:12:02,980 --> 00:12:07,200
His name is Bei Luo Shi Men. The demons outside know that Master Men is protecting us.

139
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:10,920
So they wouldn't care to come inside the village to eat people.

140
00:12:10,920 --> 00:12:13,980
Just now didn't you say that you know about Bei Luo Shi Men?

141
00:12:13,980 --> 00:12:15,870
That monkey?

142
00:12:17,910 --> 00:12:21,710
So, do you know where those two are right now?

143
00:12:21,710 --> 00:12:23,960
Master Man has gone out to beat monsters.

144
00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:26,700
Now that I think about it, he went outside for a couple days already.

145
00:12:26,700 --> 00:12:31,630
Master Nan is cultivating himself under the Bodhi Tree. Seems like tomorrow morning he will come out.

146
00:12:55,540 --> 00:12:57,330
Thank you, you two.

147
00:12:57,330 --> 00:12:58,920
Your welcome.

148
00:12:58,920 --> 00:13:01,550
Just then, they said we were some demon.

149
00:13:01,550 --> 00:13:04,130
No, it's a misunderstanding.

150
00:13:04,130 --> 00:13:08,260
Sorry everyone, my friend here is new so his words are harsh,

151
00:13:08,260 --> 00:13:11,410
But he's not a bad person so please don't put it to heart.

152
00:13:11,410 --> 00:13:13,200
We won't.

153
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:15,030
We prepared a guest room for you two.

154
00:13:15,030 --> 00:13:17,370
Oh! Then thank you.

155
00:13:17,370 --> 00:13:19,960
- This way.   - Thank you.

156
00:13:19,960 --> 00:13:21,490
This way.

157
00:13:21,490 --> 00:13:25,050
Look! Do you think this one looks pretty?

158
00:13:25,050 --> 00:13:27,410
Look, it's this fluffy kind.

159
00:13:27,930 --> 00:13:30,110
- Let's go.   - Is it this one?

160
00:13:30,110 --> 00:13:34,260
Yes. It's this one. Let's go. I'll open the door for you.

161
00:13:37,450 --> 00:13:40,580
Big brother, big sister, you can live here for a while.

162
00:13:40,580 --> 00:13:42,800
When it is dinner time, I will come get you.

163
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:45,790
We will eat in Shui'er's house. I'll go back to take care of Shui'er first.

164
00:13:45,790 --> 00:13:48,740
Okay, thanks Gou'er. If you need help with anything, come find Sister.

165
00:13:48,740 --> 00:13:49,770
Okay. I'm leaving.

166
00:13:49,770 --> 00:13:51,130
Bye.

167
00:13:53,740 --> 00:13:56,700
Cao Yan Bing, the bodhi tree is in front of us,

168
00:13:56,700 --> 00:13:58,620
What should we do next?

169
00:13:58,620 --> 00:14:02,140
What can we do? Just wait.

170
00:14:02,140 --> 00:14:06,120
Guigu Santong has said before, in these few days the Bodhi tree will undergo Qi Ming.

171
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:08,780
I think it shouldn't be too long to wait.

172
00:14:08,780 --> 00:14:13,400
But, the people at this village seems really strange.

173
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:17,760
The people from the inside say that the people from the outside are demons then the people from the outside say the people in the inside for demons.

174
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:20,600
Which side do you think is lying?

175
00:14:21,950 --> 00:14:25,830
Maybe, both sides are not lying.

176
00:14:29,610 --> 00:14:33,350
Recently, I feel like I remember some things.

177
00:14:33,350 --> 00:14:37,400
But after I woke up, I forgot it all.

178
00:14:38,010 --> 00:14:40,850
Do you have the same situation?

179
00:14:40,850 --> 00:14:45,090
But it's actually nothing much. Everyday I just do some housework.

180
00:14:45,090 --> 00:14:48,440
Or mend some fabrics, just like we are doing now.

181
00:14:48,440 --> 00:14:52,310
Maybe we just forgot about those repeated days.

182
00:14:52,310 --> 00:14:54,530
But I keep feeling like...

183
00:14:55,040 --> 00:15:00,160
Gou'er, can it be that our illness can never be cured?

184
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:03,410
Don't think this way. You have to trust Master Nan and Master Men.

185
00:15:03,410 --> 00:15:07,480
One is the requiem general of Yulin Street, the other one is a learned Doctor Nan.

186
00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:10,600
Two such powerful people are tirelessly helping us.

187
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:12,880
How can we give up ourselves?

188
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:14,480
Yes.

189
00:15:17,800 --> 00:15:22,100
But, that big brother and big sister who came from the outside village,

190
00:15:22,100 --> 00:15:26,780
I feel they are nice, so not everyone outside village is looking down on us.

191
00:15:26,780 --> 00:15:29,220
Also, I don't know why but,

192
00:15:29,220 --> 00:15:31,970
I feel like that sister seems really close.

193
00:15:31,970 --> 00:15:35,380
It's like I've seen her before.

194
00:15:36,460 --> 00:15:40,010
Your this weapon... seems like there are a lot of mechanisms.

195
00:15:40,010 --> 00:15:42,340
Did you do it yourself?

196
00:15:42,340 --> 00:15:44,940
No, it's passed on.

197
00:15:44,940 --> 00:15:47,920
Your ancestor is Cao Cao...

198
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:50,330
It should be a knife instead.

199
00:15:58,430 --> 00:16:01,990
You said that Ghostdom is formed from a big bang?

200
00:16:01,990 --> 00:16:03,590
That's right.

201
00:16:04,310 --> 00:16:06,470
Then, where did that big explosion come from?

202
00:16:06,470 --> 00:16:07,860
It was man-made.

203
00:16:07,860 --> 00:16:09,500
Man-made?

204
00:16:10,940 --> 00:16:13,970
Man-made explosion formed the Ghostdom.

205
00:16:13,970 --> 00:16:15,440
Before humans,

206
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:19,450
There's an even more advanced civilisation ruling the earth.

207
00:16:20,420 --> 00:16:24,740
They are called, the ancients.

208
00:16:25,230 --> 00:16:29,430
Ancients? Why did I never hear before?

209
00:16:30,310 --> 00:16:32,770
Why did they want to build the Ghostdom?

210
00:16:34,350 --> 00:16:36,750
Why did Shi Emperor want to find paradise?

211
00:16:36,750 --> 00:16:39,050
For immortality.

212
00:16:41,840 --> 00:16:45,110
The people who lived over thousand years in the Ghostdom,

213
00:16:45,780 --> 00:16:47,730
are they still too little?

214
00:16:48,650 --> 00:16:51,530
Are they still alive?

215
00:16:51,530 --> 00:16:53,270
They died.

216
00:16:54,730 --> 00:16:57,070
Burned by the fire they stirred up themselves.

217
00:16:58,080 --> 00:17:02,820
Could it be the weapon left by the ancients?

218
00:17:02,820 --> 00:17:07,200
Ancients? What the hell...

219
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:10,470
But Cao Yan Bing, I heard those two little girls say

220
00:17:10,470 --> 00:17:13,150
That Bei Luo Shi Men is obviously a man,

221
00:17:13,150 --> 00:17:15,470
but why did you say before

222
00:17:15,470 --> 00:17:18,570
he's a star in the sky and a monkey on the ground.

223
00:17:18,570 --> 00:17:21,300
What does that mean? Do you know each other?

224
00:17:21,830 --> 00:17:22,690
Don't know him.

225
00:17:22,690 --> 00:17:23,750
What?

226
00:17:23,750 --> 00:17:27,520
From what I know, he is famous.

227
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:30,600
He is the requiem general of Yulin Street.

228
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:34,910
It's said that he is a man who makes people fear him, has an astonishing skill.

229
00:17:34,910 --> 00:17:38,600
He won't have compassion towards the evil spirits.

230
00:17:41,390 --> 00:17:45,170
It's said that the evil spirits in Yulin Street called him General Men,

231
00:17:45,640 --> 00:17:48,220
gave him a title as the Fighting God of Yulin Street.

232
00:17:48,790 --> 00:17:52,420
General Men... Fighting God...

233
00:17:52,420 --> 00:17:54,600
So he is the God of the door.   (Men in English is door)

234
00:17:57,090 --> 00:18:04,090
Timing and Subtitles brought by The Spiritual Guardians @ Viki

235
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:10,140
Speaking of Cao Cao, and Cao Cao comes.   (Speak of the devil, and the devil comes. )

236
00:18:10,140 --> 00:18:12,090
Your ancestor is here?

237
00:18:12,820 --> 00:18:15,280
I'm talking about him.

238
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:31,190
[Preview]

239
00:18:31,190 --> 00:18:35,970
Cao Yan Bing, the original requiem general in Rakshasa Street,

240
00:18:35,970 --> 00:18:40,200
because of destroying Sacred Pagoda Tree, so is now being wanted by Ghostdom.

241
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:44,170
Sacred Pagoda Tree... was indeed blown up by me!

242
00:18:44,170 --> 00:18:47,530
Li Xuan Yuan. Li Xuan Yuan! Come out, Li Xuan Yuan!

243

Kill all of them.

244
00:18:52,700 --> 00:18:56,890
They were still alright yesterday, You and I don't even know what's happening.

245
00:18:56,890 --> 00:19:00,470
And your are not requiem general anymore, you can't kill!

246
00:19:04,030 --> 00:19:05,990

You can read it?

248
00:19:08,120 --> 00:19:09,780
It's just Qin Zhuan.   (The ancient calligraphy adopted during Qin dynasty.)

249
00:19:13,250 --> 00:19:14,490

Why do you keep following me? Why are you following me?

253
00:19:25,660 --> 00:19:27,020
EH?

254
00:19:27,020 --> 00:19:29,280
Can it be that your an expert stalker?!

255
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:33,280
- Do you remember it?   - Everyday I wake up, I forget it.

256
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:37,050
You remember it, right? Oh, you don't have to remember, it's Shui'er's lines.

257
00:19:37,050 --> 00:19:38,610
That's right. I say that...

258
00:19:38,610 --> 00:19:40,840
It's alright, alright. Where's Shui'er?

259
00:19:40,840 --> 00:19:42,120
She ran into the house.

260
00:19:42,120 --> 00:19:44,640
- Call Shui'er to come.   - Shui'er!

261
