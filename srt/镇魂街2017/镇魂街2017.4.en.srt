2
00:00:08,770 --> 00:00:13,190
Don't bother, child surnamed Cao.

3
00:00:14,620 --> 00:00:17,960
You want to die first? That's fine too.

4
00:00:17,960 --> 00:00:19,800
Guardian spirit!

5
00:00:21,980 --> 00:00:23,730
How dare you try and bluff me!

6
00:00:23,730 --> 00:00:26,030
Brother, you came back?

7
00:00:29,510 --> 00:00:33,910
Enough! Let Cao Yan Bing return to burn some paper offerings for you both!

8
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:38,890
- Cao Yan Bing!   - Brother!

9
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:08,370
Rakshasa Street

10
00:02:08,370 --> 00:02:10,700
Episode 4

11
00:02:12,940 --> 00:02:18,700
Demolishing my wall. Entering my territory. Beating my younger brother. Scaring my girl.

12
00:02:18,700 --> 00:02:19,680
Hey!

13
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:23,220
I must figure this debt properly with you.

14
00:02:23,870 --> 00:02:28,220
I wondered who finally appeared. Cao Yan Bing.

15
00:02:28,220 --> 00:02:32,340
Brother. He and the people 10 years ago are the same group.

16
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:39,320
I have a lot to ask you, but I know you won't talk.

17
00:02:39,320 --> 00:02:41,330
You are really funny.

18
00:02:41,330 --> 00:02:44,270
If you don't talk, I'll beat you until you're half dead!

19
00:02:44,270 --> 00:02:48,130
You begging for forgiveness will be your answer.

20
00:02:49,820 --> 00:02:50,920
Do you understand?

21
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:54,470
Cao Yan Bing. Do you know who I am?

22
00:02:55,320 --> 00:02:57,910
Do you understand?

23
00:02:57,910 --> 00:03:01,340
Understood. Understood.

24
00:03:02,100 --> 00:03:03,280
Your surname

25
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:05,720
Hei Er Kan Pu

26
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:08,240
- Occupation.  - Special knight of the kingdom.

27
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:10,050
Purpose

28
00:03:14,430 --> 00:03:17,540
Capture Cao Xuan Liang's guardian spirit.

29
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:21,950
Brother. His target is also the spirit pagoda tree.

30
00:03:21,950 --> 00:03:23,820
Also the spirit pagoda tree

31
00:03:23,820 --> 00:03:28,030
10 years ago, did all of you come because of the spirit pagoda tree?!

32
00:03:28,030 --> 00:03:29,590
Yes

33
00:03:30,730 --> 00:03:35,180
But it wasn't me at that time. That task was executed by another person.

34
00:03:35,180 --> 00:03:37,640
Who made you?

35
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:38,760
I do not know.

36
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:40,420
Speak!

37
00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:47,620
The kingdom is a very large organization. I'm just a small bandit among them.

38
00:03:47,620 --> 00:03:51,480
Higher up. I really do not know.

39
00:03:53,980 --> 00:03:56,880
You're so weak, like a small bandit.

40
00:03:56,880 --> 00:04:00,770
Brother. Don't be deceived by him. His guardian spirit is Dao Jin Yi Hong.

41
00:04:00,770 --> 00:04:02,750
Dao Jin Yi Hong?

42
00:04:33,990 --> 00:04:38,760
Kid, don't you know what delay tactics is?

43
00:04:50,760 --> 00:04:53,300
If you come closer, I'll kill him!

44
00:04:54,670 --> 00:04:57,960
If the spirit host dies, the guardian spirit also dies.

45
00:05:01,670 --> 00:05:05,450
What? Turns out you're not his guardian spirit.

46
00:05:22,570 --> 00:05:32,240
Timing and Subtitles brought to you by The Spiritual Guardians @ Viki

47
00:05:58,920 --> 00:06:02,950
Lord. Let me out.

48
00:06:02,950 --> 00:06:09,360
Lord. You have proven yourself as a powerful spirit host.

49
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:11,800
Let me out.

50
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:13,850
I really proved it?

51
00:06:13,850 --> 00:06:17,570
I believe Wen Ze did not blame you.

52
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:24,550
Xiao Liang

53
00:06:25,690 --> 00:06:27,840
Cao Yan Bing

54
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:32,670
Although Wen Ze left, Hu Chi will be determined and courageous to advance.

55
00:06:32,670 --> 00:06:34,520
Wake up quickly!

56
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:40,690
You and I have been waiting for this day for 10 years.

57
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:50,660
Hu Chi requests to fight.

58
00:06:50,660 --> 00:06:54,200
Xu Chu!

59
00:07:39,940 --> 00:07:41,730
What's wrong?

60
00:07:41,730 --> 00:07:43,590
Thanks

61
00:07:47,980 --> 00:07:49,550
Xiao Liang

62
00:08:03,670 --> 00:08:05,500
We won.

63
00:08:19,490 --> 00:08:22,630
God of Ninja, Hattori Hanzo?

64
00:09:37,090 --> 00:09:38,630
Ling Ling likes to eat these.

65
00:09:38,630 --> 00:09:40,290
Right.

66
00:09:42,540 --> 00:09:44,700
What's wrong? There are so many people.

67
00:09:44,700 --> 00:09:46,570
Here. I'll go out and see. You pay.

68
00:09:46,570 --> 00:09:50,160
Ok. Don't run far.

69
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:53,750
Hurry. Take a picture.

70
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:06,040
The fire of Sacred Pagoda connected two worlds.

71
00:10:06,040 --> 00:10:10,510
Apparently, Hattori Hanzo has accomplished the mission of destroying Sacred Pagoda tree.

72
00:10:10,510 --> 00:10:14,820
Sacred Pagoda branch must be already in his hand too.

73
00:10:16,250 --> 00:10:19,960
I never worried about the mission assigned to Hattori.

74
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:23,370
He is the first generation descendant of Hattori Hanzo.

75
00:10:23,370 --> 00:10:28,730
His body is flowing the blood of God of Ninja.

76
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:40,820
That is...

77
00:10:40,820 --> 00:10:43,290
The light's boundary.

78
00:10:45,050 --> 00:10:48,150
Captain, it seems the place of occurrence of the light is at Rakshasa street.

79
00:10:48,150 --> 00:10:50,180
Rakshasa street?

80
00:10:51,740 --> 00:10:53,320
Where is that?

81
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:04,600
Mom.

82
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:08,600
Ling Ling. Are you at school? Did you take a look at the sky?

83
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:11,200
I am looking at it right now.

84
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:12,800
What is that in the sky?

85
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:17,400
It's huge! It looks like a city! And the inside is all fiery!

86
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:19,100
Uhh...

87
00:11:41,540 --> 00:11:43,780
Mom, the signal is bad. I will call you later.

88
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:46,300
Hello?

89
00:12:05,570 --> 00:12:06,790
It's you.

90
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:10,800
You're that guy from the video, called something like Gui Shu San Tong!

91
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:12,800
He's called Gui Fu San Tong

92
00:12:17,790 --> 00:12:23,570
I am named Gui Fu San Tong. I am honored to meet you, Fire General.

93
00:12:24,510 --> 00:12:27,770
Is that axe yours?

94
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:31,000
It's mine.

95
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,800
Pay for it! Hurry and pay for cutting the tree!

96
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:37,700
Brother, it looks he did it to put out the fire.

97
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:55,200
What's wrong? What's wrong? What's with all these people?

98
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:57,800
Just then there was... there was a big flame!

99
00:12:57,800 --> 00:12:59,800
It was all fiery, super huge!

100
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:03,200
- Go, go. They're waiting for us.  - It was really scary!

101
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:11,800
Pay me back! Pay for burning the tree! Pay for cutting the tree! Hurry and pay up!

102
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:16,700
- Pay up! - Ok, ok! Please don't get so emotional, Fire General. I'll pay you.

103
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:31,700
I was in a rush to leave, so I only bought this much.

104
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:39,800
I was just joking with him. He actually thought I was being serious.

105
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:45,600
Okay. Let's forget about the tree.

106
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:51,600
- I am here - Speak.

107
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:53,900
What are you doing here?

108
00:14:58,600 --> 00:15:01,200
Master, the mission is complete.

109
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:06,400
Now the light of worlds' opening has disappeared. The Sacred Pagoda should be burnt up already.

110
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:08,700
Who injured you?

111
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,400
By Cao Yan Bing's spirit guardian.

112
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:14,000
Cao Yan Bing's spirit guardian?

113
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:18,400
No way. Cao Yan Bing's spirit guardian died ten years ago in a battle.

114
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:21,000
It wasn't Yu Jin, but Xu Chu.

115
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:24,400
Xu Chu? Hu Chi?

116
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:27,500
What a surprising kid.

117
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:31,600
Why don't you let me go personally and

118
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:35,400
get rid of him instantly.

119
00:15:35,400 --> 00:15:38,900
There will be someone else taking care of Fire General.

120
00:15:38,900 --> 00:15:40,800
You don't need to bother it.

121
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:44,600
Hattori, bring Hale to treat his wounds.

122
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:47,500
Also, pay attention to Cao Yan Bing.

123
00:15:47,500 --> 00:15:48,800
Yes.

124
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:02,400
Calling out your guardian spirit will create a burden on the spirit host,

125
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:06,100
especially for someone who suddenly awakened his guardian spirit, like you.

126
00:16:06,100 --> 00:16:10,700
In the next moment, your eyes will fill with blood.

127
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:16,600
And then, you will have a nosebleed.

128
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:27,800
Finally, you will see darkness,

129
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:32,400
grow weak, and faint.

130
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:36,800
Brother.

131
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:39,500
- Cao Yan Bing.   - Brother.

132
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:07,700
Who is it?!

133
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,200
Yay! I won. Yay!

134
00:17:22,600 --> 00:17:24,400
Give me five.

135
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:30,800
Bro, what are you doing with your weapon?

136
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:32,000
Where's that lady?

137
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,400
Are you talking about Xia Ling?

138
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:37,000
She said that her parents are coming over so she went to go eat with them.

139
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:51,000
Come with me for a bit

140
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:08,100
As far as I could remember,

141
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:13,600
this tree has always been in my backyard.

142
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:16,000
I've long gotten used to playing chess beneath this tree, have tea,

143
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:19,400
play on my phone, snatch red envelopes.

144
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:24,200
I would wash my clothes and hang them on the tree to dry.

145
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:30,800
But now, it has actually become a bunch used coals.

146
00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:34,800
Seems like Fire General actually

147
00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:37,600
cares so much about this Sacred Pagoda tree.

148
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:43,800
Sacred Pagoda tree was planted during Dong Jing dynasty.

149
00:18:43,800 --> 00:18:46,200
Today, it has been almost 1,600 years.

150
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:49,600
About 1,600 years?

151
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:55,600
Fire General, do you know the relationship between Ghostdom and the human realm?

152
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:59,600
Ghostdom is one world. The human realm is another.

153
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:04,400
Yes, this is correct. However, how did the Ghostdom come about?

154
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:07,200
God created the universe in seven days.

155
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:11,000
Could it be, that Ghostdom was also created?

156
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:16,300
Bingo. You are right.

157
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:20,500
You this psychic!

158
00:19:22,700 --> 00:19:24,000
You...

159
00:19:37,300 --> 00:19:40,200
-This way. -Okay. Thank you.

160
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:52,600
-Hello. Here's the menu. -Thank you.

161
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:15,200
Sister Xia Ling and Uncle Ghost, I can't handle this anymore. I'm going to go sleep first.

162
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:19,800
There's plenty of rooms, you two better go to sleep soon. I won't bother with you two anymore.

163
00:20:19,800 --> 00:20:21,800
- Goodnight.   - Goodnight.

164
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:40,600
I know that you have one hundred thousand, "whys" in your heart.

165
00:20:41,350 --> 00:20:44,930
Number one. Who exactly are you?

166
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:50,000
This one here has already dressed up in this way,

167
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:54,600
clearly to avoid being recognized in my original appearance.

168
00:20:56,000 --> 00:21:00,800
Second, you said someone wants to hurt me. How did you know?

169
00:21:00,800 --> 00:21:04,800
Also you said I didn't die in the bus accident because it was just an accident.

170
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:09,000
You also said that I was originally a dead person.

171
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,500
Because Miss Xia is a spirit host.

172
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:15,800
At the bus accident, your guardian appeared,

173
00:21:15,800 --> 00:21:18,200
and protected you, Miss Xia.

174
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:23,500
Or else it would've been hard for Miss Xia to live.

175
00:21:24,500 --> 00:21:28,700
That bus accident... is it all related to this?

176
00:21:28,700 --> 00:21:31,600
Then how come after the bus accident, I didn't remember anything?

177
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:33,100
The bus accident...

178
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:36,800
It's just an accident.

179
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:41,500
And why Miss Xia doesn't remember it, then I don't know how to explain.

180
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:46,300
Perhaps, a doctor's explanation will be more accurate.

181
00:21:46,300 --> 00:21:47,600
Number three.

182
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:52,800
The one who wants to harm me, who can go invisible, is called what...

183
00:21:52,800 --> 00:21:57,800
evil spirit, why do they want to harm me?

184
00:21:57,800 --> 00:22:00,600
Because you are...

185
00:22:01,800 --> 00:22:05,100
a spirit host.

186
00:22:05,100 --> 00:22:10,400
I'm not sure if the Fire General has mentioned it to Miss Xia. I have sent out a warning message,

187
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:14,400
informing all spirit guardians to beware of an organization called the Kingdom organization.

188
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:17,000
They capture other spirit guardians,

189
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:19,600
and force them to join the organization.

190
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:25,200
It is similar to an evil cult.

191
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:29,000
So that evil spirit actually came to capture me?

192
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:30,500
That's right.

193
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:35,600
- Ling Ling!   - Dad, mom.

194
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:38,600
- Dad, mom! Take a seat..  - Ling Ling.

195
00:22:38,600 --> 00:22:42,000
We bought so many things today that my legs were about to break.

196
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:45,500
Hurry and sit. Wah, so many things!

197
00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:51,010
This is too fatty!

198
00:22:51,010 --> 00:22:53,830
Hey! This is high in sugars!

199
00:22:59,080 --> 00:23:02,310
I can't eat this. I can't eat that. Why did you order it?

200
00:23:02,310 --> 00:23:03,800
It's for your father to eat.

201
00:23:03,800 --> 00:23:06,180
Here. Eat.

202
00:23:06,180 --> 00:23:08,240
Here. Eat more vegetables.

203
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:11,600
Women have to keep a nice body or they won't be able to get married.

204
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:17,420
How old am I? My life is just beginning! This beautiful flower is about to

205
00:23:18,560 --> 00:23:20,250
blossom...

206
00:23:22,830 --> 00:23:25,770
Newton devoted the later years of his life to God,

207
00:23:25,770 --> 00:23:29,140
working diligently to prove the existence of God.

208
00:23:29,140 --> 00:23:32,180
Do you think he's silly?

209
00:23:32,180 --> 00:23:35,100
Theology is a science awaiting to be explained.

210
00:23:35,100 --> 00:23:38,640
Ghostdom is indeed a place that was created.

211
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:43,870
But it wasn't by... God.

212
00:23:44,680 --> 00:23:48,180
Fire General, do you know how the universe came about?

213
00:23:48,180 --> 00:23:49,230
The Big Bang.

214
00:23:49,230 --> 00:23:53,130
The Big Bang Theory of the universe states that

215
00:23:53,130 --> 00:23:56,720
the universe came about from a big explosion.

216
00:23:56,720 --> 00:24:01,270
And this universe that came out of the Big Bang is constantly expanding.

217
00:24:01,270 --> 00:24:04,450
The ones who created the Ghostdom made use of this theory.

218
00:24:04,450 --> 00:24:09,260
They also used a large explosion to create a new and small space.

219
00:24:09,310 --> 00:24:13,320
Started out as a small space? So Ghostdom is included in it?

220
00:24:13,320 --> 00:24:17,020
This space that started out small, was continually growing.

221
00:24:17,020 --> 00:24:21,020
It kept growing until it became the huge Ghostdom that you know of now.

222
00:24:21,020 --> 00:24:25,980
Furthermore, this ever expanding Ghostdom is constantly pushing on its borders.

223
00:24:25,980 --> 00:24:29,180
Until one day... boom!

224
00:24:30,550 --> 00:24:34,220
It collided with the human realm.

225
00:24:34,220 --> 00:24:35,710
Collided with the human realm?

226
00:24:35,710 --> 00:24:40,090
This is just like an increasingly expanding bubble meets another bubble.

227
00:24:40,160 --> 00:24:43,850
If two bubbles crash into each other, what will happen?

228
00:24:43,850 --> 00:24:45,740
If two bubbles collide they will just pressure each other.

229
00:24:45,740 --> 00:24:50,520
But I would prefer to use the simile of connected spaces to describe this situation.

230
00:24:50,520 --> 00:24:57,070
This situation has a name that is very familiar to you both, Men (door).

231
00:24:58,770 --> 00:25:02,840
So it turns out the door connecting the two worlds is because of this!

232
00:25:02,840 --> 00:25:07,050
The universe is constantly expanding. Ghostdom is also constantly expanding.

233
00:25:07,050 --> 00:25:12,350
If these two bubbles continuously push against each other, then what will happen?

234
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:16,930
The smaller bubble will be pushed into the larger bubble, and then become a part of the larger bubble.

235
00:25:16,930 --> 00:25:19,770
Bingo. You are right again.

236
00:25:19,770 --> 00:25:22,480
This small bubble contains one world. The large bubble

237
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:28,010
contains an earth. When the section connecting the two places dissolves,

238
00:25:28,010 --> 00:25:31,930
what will happen to these two worlds?

239
00:25:31,930 --> 00:25:36,640
The air will flow freely between the two, the environments will combine, and will become a new world.

240
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:39,550
You are in me, I am in you

241
00:25:39,550 --> 00:25:46,100
It will be a huge, splendid whirlpool.

242
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:48,480
It would be a word destroying vortex?

243
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:51,430
Yes, it is the a vortex that destroys worlds.

244
00:25:51,430 --> 00:25:55,100
Bloody mixer...

245
00:25:55,100 --> 00:25:59,050
Then... why is the world not destroyed yet?

246
00:25:59,050 --> 00:26:03,320
Since, the universe is constantly expanding.

247
00:26:05,480 --> 00:26:10,980
Alright, go back to the beginning of the topic.

248
00:26:10,980 --> 00:26:18,010
Because of the existence of the Spirit pagoda tree, we are all still alive.

249
00:26:20,560 --> 00:26:23,600
Here, let's make an example.

250
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:28,590
Ghostdom can be likened to a piece of plastic wrap that is constantly being stretched out.

251
00:26:28,590 --> 00:26:33,700
If, on the border of this plastic wrap we hammer in a nail

252
00:26:33,700 --> 00:26:39,970
and fix it to ground with this nail, this plastic wrap will not continue to get larger.

253
00:26:39,970 --> 00:26:43,630
The Spirit pagoda tree is just like this nail.

254
00:26:43,630 --> 00:26:46,530
But, just this one nail is not enough.

255
00:26:46,530 --> 00:26:51,500
That's right. So, 632 years ago

256
00:26:51,500 --> 00:26:54,460
the constables, in order to limit the expansion of Ghostdom,

257
00:26:54,460 --> 00:27:00,100
planted 12 hundred thousand Spirit Pagoda trees.

258
00:27:00,120 --> 00:27:03,980
- Twelve hundred thousand? - - Yes, twelve hundred thousand.

259
00:27:03,980 --> 00:27:07,330
They are scattered across all the hundreds and thousands of requiem streets.

260
00:27:07,330 --> 00:27:10,720
However, most of them don't have the ability to stabilize the space.

261
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:17,840
They are actually just a smokescreen. Only every one in every hundred thousand is a truly space stabilizing "nail".

262
00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:21,160
These 12 trees are called the Spirit trees.

263
00:27:21,160 --> 00:27:24,830
This Spirit pagoda tree is one of those.

264
00:27:24,830 --> 00:27:29,030
So, as long as these 12 spirit trees are destroyed,

265
00:27:29,030 --> 00:27:33,470
Ghostdom and the human realm will be doomed?

266
00:27:33,470 --> 00:27:38,300
They don't all have to be destroyed.

267
00:27:38,300 --> 00:27:41,130
Think about it. This plastic wrap is constantly being pulled apart.

268
00:27:41,130 --> 00:27:46,770
If one of the nails stabilizing it is pulled out, then the remaining nails...

269
00:27:46,770 --> 00:27:50,000
The remaining nails will automatically be weakened.

270
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:53,030
In other words, as long as one of the Spirit trees are destroyed,

271
00:27:53,030 --> 00:27:57,060
The rest of the Spirit trees will be unable to hold on.

272
00:27:57,060 --> 00:28:00,900
If you think back to the strange light that showed up yesterday,

273
00:28:00,900 --> 00:28:04,880
you will know that I am telling you the true situation.

274
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:09,310
I'd like to know, who exactly destroyed my tree.

275
00:28:09,310 --> 00:28:12,840
And you, how come you appeared at the critical moment to put out the fire?

276
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:18,040
Not sure if Fire General noticed,

277
00:28:18,040 --> 00:28:24,620
yesterday, right before the Spirit pagoda tree was destroyed, a new sprout grew out.

278
00:28:26,800 --> 00:28:31,050
This kind of appearance on the tree is known as a new start.

279
00:28:31,050 --> 00:28:34,590
Each of the twelve trees harbor an immense amount of strength.

280
00:28:34,590 --> 00:28:39,510
Only after a new start occurs can one of these trees be destroyed.

281
00:28:39,510 --> 00:28:44,260
Sacred Pagoda was planted in 1632 years ago.

282
00:28:44,260 --> 00:28:49,960
Yesterday was the first time this would happen. This is a secret that only a handful of people would know.

283
00:28:49,960 --> 00:28:54,130
It is very normal for Fire General to not know about this.

284
00:28:54,130 --> 00:29:00,490
So, you're saying for me to not know that this Spirit pagoda tree has been growing in my backyard for 1632 years is perfectly normal, and that for you to know this is normal?

285
00:29:02,250 --> 00:29:10,090
Come on, Fire General. Look at how I am dressed, clearly I am in disguise.

286
00:29:10,090 --> 00:29:15,480
Gui Fu San Tong, such a strange name, is also clearly an alias.

287
00:29:15,480 --> 00:29:24,210
Without question, I am obviously an extremeeeemley awesome person.

288
00:29:24,920 --> 00:29:29,340
Therefore, for me to know this information, is obviously very normal.

289
00:29:29,340 --> 00:29:33,390
Fire General, are you starting to have a sense of powerlessness?

290
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:39,210
No matter. However, the next things I say to you, please remember well.

291
00:29:39,210 --> 00:29:49,460
After Qi Ming, the new branch grown out from Sacred Pagoda tree is called Sacred Pagoda branch. As long as we get back the Sacred Pagoda branch, we may restore Sacred Pagoda tree.

292
00:29:49,460 --> 00:29:54,840
I'm willing to help Fire General to get back the Sacred Pagoda branch.

293
00:29:58,300 --> 00:30:00,720
I refuse.

294
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:07,810
I only care about ruling this street, it's not in my job description to save the world. If you please, Mr. Gui, pick up your drawing and take your leave.

295
00:30:09,330 --> 00:30:13,840
Even if you don't care to pursue the ones who invaded your territory yesterday,

296
00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:19,280
Do you not wish to pursue the ones who killed your friend and your guardian spirit ten years ago?

297
00:30:19,280 --> 00:30:22,720
Does Fire General not wish to know the truth?

298
00:30:36,330 --> 00:30:38,260
What exactly are you?

299
00:30:38,260 --> 00:30:41,380
Timing and Subtitles brought by The Spiritual Guardians @ Viki

300
00:30:41,380 --> 00:30:44,750
Bring Miss Xia Lin along with us on our trip.

301
00:30:44,750 --> 00:30:48,340
I haven't even graduated college, and you already want me to meet with suitors, isn't that a bit crazy?

302
00:30:49,970 --> 00:30:52,920
Why hasn't my guardian spirit shown up yet?

303
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:55,630
He was formerly in the service of the Muwen family

304
00:30:55,630 --> 00:30:58,300
She's a beauty that can overthrow countries and cities.

305
00:30:59,140 --> 00:31:04,180
Afterwards, we were attacted to each other, and fell in love.

306
00:31:04,220 --> 00:31:08,140
Unfortunately, she contracted an incurable disease.

307
00:31:08,190 --> 00:31:12,840
If I cannot save her, then I will join her in death!

308
00:31:12,840 --> 00:31:13,730
Xuan Yuan!
