00:01:15,460 --> 00:01:17,590
- Episode 16 -

4
00:01:24,950 --> 00:01:26,340
Who are all of them?

5
00:01:26,340 --> 00:01:31,770
They are the genuine villagers of Mingjing Village.

6
00:01:31,770 --> 00:01:34,030
The genuine villagers?

7
00:01:36,860 --> 00:01:41,280
Those villagers you saw before in Mingjing Village

8
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:44,300
didn't live in Mingjing village before.

9
00:01:44,300 --> 00:01:47,350
Do you know where they came from?

10
00:01:47,350 --> 00:01:49,240
They came from the human world.

11
00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:51,440
You knew?

12
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:55,520
I saw a trace of BCG vaccine on a young girl's arm in the village.

13
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:59,950
Only humans can have that BCG vaccine. The vaccine is injected in childhood.

14
00:01:59,950 --> 00:02:04,850
That type of vaccine is to prevent a type of disease called tuberculosis in humans,

15
00:02:04,850 --> 00:02:09,580
but I'm not sure whether every villager...

16
00:02:09,580 --> 00:02:12,760
They are all humans.

17
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:16,390
I know this is a bit unimaginable.

18
00:02:16,390 --> 00:02:23,010
Because other than the spirit host, only a few can survive in Ghostdom.

19
00:02:23,010 --> 00:02:28,540
To adapt to the environment, either they're slow

20
00:02:29,370 --> 00:02:34,270
to evolve into a spirit or they're extremely fast

21
00:02:34,270 --> 00:02:39,090
and become an unusual person. But the humans in Mingjing village

22
00:02:39,090 --> 00:02:43,750
clearly don't belong to these two types.

23
00:02:49,780 --> 00:02:51,890
What is the truth behind this matter?

24
00:02:51,890 --> 00:02:59,100
They were fooled by others and escorted from the human world to requiem streets to be experimented on.

25
00:02:59,100 --> 00:03:04,580
The experiment was about getting humans to survive in Ghostdom.

26
00:03:08,430 --> 00:03:13,670
Because the spirit world's environment is too much of a burden for humans,

27
00:03:13,670 --> 00:03:20,030
the humans who survived in Ghostdom will continue to be injured.

28
00:03:20,030 --> 00:03:26,170
But if there's a way to let this injury completely recover in a flash,

29
00:03:26,170 --> 00:03:31,990
the humans can continue to live in Ghostdom.

30
00:03:33,890 --> 00:03:36,800
This isn't the ability to strengthen the cell structure,

31
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:39,630
but the ability to add back the cells lost in cell division.

32
00:03:39,630 --> 00:03:42,000
The number of cells surviving cell division is limited.

33
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:47,900
By adding back the cells lost in cell division, it's practically preparing to support the life expectancy of the future.

34
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:55,430
The villagers of Mingjing Village will be dying soon

35
00:03:56,340 --> 00:03:59,850
because all of them are experimental products.

36
00:03:59,850 --> 00:04:04,780
So the villagers think the outsiders are demons. They don't dare go out of the village.

37
00:04:04,780 --> 00:04:08,960
The outsiders think the villagers are demons. They don't dare to enter the village.

38
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:13,910
This way, the secret wouldn't be exposed.

39
00:04:13,910 --> 00:04:19,160
Right. That's their strategy.

40
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:20,890
What about the demons who left the village 5 years ago?

41
00:04:20,890 --> 00:04:23,930
Most of them are dead already.

42
00:04:23,930 --> 00:04:26,500
The lucky survivors

43
00:04:27,540 --> 00:04:31,550
are these people you see in front of you.

44
00:04:31,550 --> 00:04:34,530
They are the first to be experimented on.

45
00:04:34,530 --> 00:04:40,280
Nan Yu Fu tested their bodies

46
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:44,740
to let the drug regenerate the human cells

47
00:04:44,740 --> 00:04:50,240
so they can live in Ghostdom.

48
00:04:51,740 --> 00:04:54,170
So he brainwashed them

49
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:58,380
to make them think they have lived here for generations

50
00:04:58,380 --> 00:05:02,100
and they lost their memories because they got sick.

51
00:05:07,810 --> 00:05:10,580
These original villagers,

52
00:05:10,580 --> 00:05:12,960
have they lived in Mingjing Village for generations?

53
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:14,460
Are they also humans?

54
00:05:14,460 --> 00:05:16,750
Right.

55
00:05:16,750 --> 00:05:19,490
They are all humans.

56
00:05:19,490 --> 00:05:21,780
But humans,

57
00:05:21,780 --> 00:05:25,600
how can they live in Ghostdom for generations?

58
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:27,910
You also know

59
00:05:27,910 --> 00:05:36,770
there's a kind of people that can. They are all spirit hosts.

60
00:05:44,140 --> 00:05:50,710
Bei Luo, I received news that Cao Yan Bing raided the Spirit Armor Army barracks

61
00:05:50,710 --> 00:05:53,450
and killed Bao Dating.

62
00:05:53,450 --> 00:05:56,550
What?! He dares...

63
00:05:59,770 --> 00:06:01,670
Let's talk outside.

64
00:06:11,620 --> 00:06:16,070
The damage to the Spirit Armor Army barracks main hall is disastrous. The spirit heavenly book was stolen.

65
00:06:16,070 --> 00:06:20,820
Maybe Cao Yan Bing is waiting for the Bodhi tree to start brightening.

66
00:06:22,620 --> 00:06:25,870
Send that girl back to the human world. Kill Cao Yan Bing.

67
00:06:25,870 --> 00:06:28,090
That will certainly protect the health of the Bodhi tree.

68
00:06:28,090 --> 00:06:31,240
Originally, we shouldn't have let him leave Mingjing Village.

69
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:35,580
We can still not let him enter Mingjing Village now.

70
00:06:37,110 --> 00:06:40,890
In order to prevent us from having a solution, Master Men will risk his life to fight.

71
00:06:54,640 --> 00:06:58,840
This person is the elder of our Mingjing Village.

72
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,190
They aren't speaking.

73
00:07:05,550 --> 00:07:08,060
Is it because they can't open their mouths?

74
00:07:08,060 --> 00:07:15,230
Kill to silence a person. If they let you live,

75
00:07:16,790 --> 00:07:21,850
they won't give you a chance to open your mouth anymore.

76
00:07:21,850 --> 00:07:23,630
Why do you help them?

77
00:07:23,630 --> 00:07:30,260
Because I'm also a Mingjing Villager.

78
00:07:35,130 --> 00:07:38,380
I don't have any more time.

79
00:07:38,380 --> 00:07:42,230
Then you can tell me everything now.

80
00:07:43,260 --> 00:07:48,540
This story happened 5 years ago.

81
00:07:48,540 --> 00:07:58,000
At that time, Mingjing Village wasn't a demonic place as rumored by the Yulin residents.

82
00:07:58,610 --> 00:08:03,930
Rather, it was a precious place to purify demons.

83
00:08:08,190 --> 00:08:11,530
I saved a viper; yet, the viper bit me.

84
00:08:11,530 --> 00:08:13,070
Did I do it wrong?

85
00:08:13,070 --> 00:08:18,190
I don't wish to evaluate whether your actions are right or wrong.

86
00:08:18,190 --> 00:08:20,740
Please follow me.

87
00:08:49,310 --> 00:08:51,190
Thank you, Elder, for saving me.

88
00:08:51,190 --> 00:08:55,360
The ancestor's teachings here previously warned us.

89
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:58,810
Sir, please don't blame us.

90
00:08:58,810 --> 00:09:03,220
I promise. I regret I'm unable to return the favor.

91
00:09:03,220 --> 00:09:05,420
Thank you.

92
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:21,040
Send him out of the village.

93
00:09:22,730 --> 00:09:26,880
The Bodhi tree can cure many diseases.

94
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:31,120
It's a godly object on earth. The ancestor's teachings said,

95
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:36,290
"Don't let outsiders know about the village's matters."

96
00:09:36,290 --> 00:09:43,260
After a person enters the village, you must first ask if it's true or false on the Mingjing platform.

97
00:09:43,260 --> 00:09:48,800
After you've been saved and treated, you must let go of your memories.

98
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:54,490
To this day, the ancestor's teachings have been around for 1600 years.

99
00:09:55,290 --> 00:09:57,380
Brother, let's go.

100
00:09:57,380 --> 00:09:59,310
What are you looking at?

101
00:10:00,190 --> 00:10:05,080
I want to know what the outside world is like.

102
00:10:08,950 --> 00:10:10,730
Don't let your imagination run wild.

103
00:10:10,730 --> 00:10:13,980
The ancestor's teachings warned that we can't go out of the village.

104
00:10:13,980 --> 00:10:15,650
Let's go quickly

105
00:10:22,430 --> 00:10:24,270
Save me...

106
00:10:26,490 --> 00:10:28,230
Save me!

107
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:33,770
Let's go.

108
00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:07,490
Elder, how is he?

109
00:11:09,110 --> 00:11:12,750
The internal organs are damaged.

110
00:11:12,750 --> 00:11:16,190
His Qi and blood are insufficient. The poison has entered the heart and brain

111
00:11:16,190 --> 00:11:20,550
and there's a fatal weakness in the stomach.

112
00:11:22,420 --> 00:11:25,400
Elder, what kind of person is he?

113
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:27,900
How can he receive so many sins?

114
00:11:27,900 --> 00:11:30,140
Can you save him?

115
00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:37,860
Before saving him, he must stand on the Minjing platform for us to investigate the cause of his injuries

116
00:11:37,860 --> 00:11:42,450
and whether he's evil or not. Then remove his memory.

117
00:11:42,450 --> 00:11:45,390
But he is weak.

118
00:11:45,390 --> 00:11:48,750
He's half dead.

119
00:11:48,750 --> 00:11:52,300
If the brain is forced to open now...

120
00:11:58,020 --> 00:12:02,720
Elder, we can't see someone dying and not save him, right?

121
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:06,240
Elder, saving a person is important.

122
00:12:18,390 --> 00:12:24,680
He's so seriously injured. It's better to deliver him to the Bodhi tree.

123
00:13:41,560 --> 00:13:43,360
You're awake?

124
00:13:48,180 --> 00:13:50,220
Did you all save me?

125
00:13:50,220 --> 00:13:51,930
Jingxuan!

126
00:13:53,490 --> 00:13:55,330
Come.

127
00:13:55,330 --> 00:13:56,890
Elder.

128
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:01,710
This person is the Elder of our Mingjing Village.

129
00:14:01,710 --> 00:14:04,380
He saved your life.

130
00:14:12,510 --> 00:14:15,250
I don't know how to thank your kindness for saving my life.

131
00:14:15,250 --> 00:14:21,710
You don't need to thank me. I just hope you can answer me truthfully.

132
00:14:21,710 --> 00:14:23,400
Definitely.

133
00:14:23,400 --> 00:14:29,150
Who are you? Why were you injured? Is there an enemy who wants to kill you?

134
00:14:29,150 --> 00:14:33,630
I'm Nan Yu Fu, main general of Spirit Armor Army.

135
00:14:33,630 --> 00:14:38,700
I heard outsiders say it's the army of the governmental mansion?

136
00:14:38,700 --> 00:14:44,280
Under the jurisdiction of Ghostdom, I led an army to attack the bandits.

137
00:14:44,280 --> 00:14:48,510
Because I recklessly entered the enemy camp alone, I nearly lost my life.

138
00:14:48,510 --> 00:14:52,890
After I was seriously injured, the Yulin people

139
00:14:52,890 --> 00:14:57,190
told me as long as I enter Mingjing Village, I'll have some hope.

140
00:14:57,190 --> 00:15:01,680
No outsiders can know what Mingjing Village is like.

141
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:05,420
I heard after a seriously injured person enters Mingjing Village

142
00:15:05,420 --> 00:15:10,700
and is healed, he will not remember anything that has happened.

143
00:15:11,500 --> 00:15:16,220
That's because before he is treated, his memory must be removed first.

144
00:15:16,220 --> 00:15:21,560
Your life was in danger, so you were an exception.

145
00:15:21,560 --> 00:15:25,060
I hope to repay your kindness later for saving my life.

146
00:15:25,060 --> 00:15:29,250
We don't need repayment. It's just the ancestor's teachings here,

147
00:15:29,250 --> 00:15:33,610
outsiders can't talk about the matters of Mingjing Village.

148
00:15:33,610 --> 00:15:37,870
Although your injury is healed, the energy in your lungs and organs are still injured.

149
00:15:37,870 --> 00:15:40,990
You need to meditate under the Bodhi tree for 10 days,

150
00:15:40,990 --> 00:15:45,660
2 hours daily to heal.

151
00:15:45,660 --> 00:15:47,730
Thank you Elder

152
00:15:48,760 --> 00:15:53,090
The fragrance distributed from the Bodhi tree

153
00:15:53,090 --> 00:15:59,030
has the peaceful will of the spirits to break a person's unlucky effects.

154
00:15:59,030 --> 00:16:05,740
After that day, Nan Yu Fu sat here meditating every day

155
00:16:05,740 --> 00:16:10,250
to heal the injuries in the lungs and organs.

156
00:16:15,330 --> 00:16:17,010
Chase after me!

157
00:16:17,010 --> 00:16:19,020
Wait for me!

158
00:16:19,020 --> 00:16:20,630
Come here quickly!

159
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:33,830
Lofty like Mount Tai. Vast like Yangtze river

160
00:16:34,420 --> 00:16:37,090
You.. You've heard of it?

161
00:16:44,820 --> 00:16:51,370
The water flows from the alpine. Your Guqin playing skills, even if Bo Ya were still alive, you would not be inferior to him.

162
00:16:54,590 --> 00:17:00,070
Mr. Nan is overpraising. I wonder, how do you feel after you meditated under the Bodhi tree?

163
00:17:03,140 --> 00:17:07,490
Relaxed and happy. It's as if the bad luck in my heart has been cleared.

164
00:17:07,490 --> 00:17:11,080
his Bodhi tree can be described as a godly tree.

165
00:17:11,780 --> 00:17:15,250
It's Mengyin ancestor who chose this precious land.

166
00:17:16,830 --> 00:17:19,440
I still don't know your name.

167
00:17:20,090 --> 00:17:24,190
I'm Bai Jingxuan. The younger brother who was with me previously was Bai Jingyin.

168
00:17:24,190 --> 00:17:27,170
All the people in Mingjing Village have the surname Bai.

169
00:17:27,830 --> 00:17:30,530
Before I came to seek treatment, I heard you say

170
00:17:30,530 --> 00:17:35,030
immortals live on the secret borders of Mingjing village.

171
00:17:35,690 --> 00:17:39,260
Actually, outsiders don't know anything about this place.

172
00:17:39,260 --> 00:17:42,580
It's just seriously ill people often come to seek treatment

173
00:17:42,580 --> 00:17:46,500
just like what Mr. Nan sees, how can there be immortals here?

174
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:50,000
We are just fishermen, carpenters, living self-sufficiently.

175
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:55,880
Elder's medical expertise is superior. If he helps the public, he'd sure to be a medical god.

176
00:17:55,880 --> 00:18:01,190
Mingjing Village has a crisscross of paths in fields, sounds of crowing cocks and barking dogs are heard around, the villagers look peaceful.

177
00:18:01,190 --> 00:18:05,530
It's truly very different from the outside scene.

178
00:18:07,930 --> 00:18:09,870
Outside?

179
00:18:09,870 --> 00:18:12,900
Brother Bai, you...

180
00:18:12,900 --> 00:18:18,210
I've lived here since I was born. I've never seen the outside world.

181
00:18:18,840 --> 00:18:21,770
Why hasn't Brother Bai gone outside to look?

182
00:18:26,260 --> 00:18:29,940
The ancestor's teachings warned we can't leave the village.

183
00:18:32,780 --> 00:18:35,090
Then it's truly a pity.

184
00:18:35,890 --> 00:18:40,990
Because the outside world is very beautiful.

185
00:18:43,470 --> 00:18:51,170
Since then, Nan Yu Fu explained about the outside world to me every day.

186
00:18:51,170 --> 00:18:56,910
He told stories that happened since 1600 years ago.

187
00:18:56,910 --> 00:19:01,010
I heard many wonderful stories

188
00:19:01,010 --> 00:19:06,000
and I heard about the lives of many helpless people.

189
00:19:13,590 --> 00:19:20,220
Ten days have been completed. The energy injuries in your lungs and organs are dissolved.

190
00:19:20,220 --> 00:19:23,960
It's time to leave the village.

191
00:19:23,960 --> 00:19:28,600
I understand. Thank you for your kindness in saving my life.

192
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:32,380
You don't need to thank me.

193
00:19:32,380 --> 00:19:36,100
It's the will of the Bodhi tree.

194
00:19:38,170 --> 00:19:40,170
Jingxuan...

195
00:19:50,780 --> 00:19:54,530
Jingxuan, I really don't want to forget you.

196
00:19:57,110 --> 00:20:01,560
Jingxuan, goodbye.

197
00:20:01,560 --> 00:20:03,690
Don't forget me.

198
00:20:48,690 --> 00:20:52,390
Mr. Nan, we will only send you here.

199
00:20:53,510 --> 00:20:55,150
Goodbye.

200
00:21:10,530 --> 00:21:13,190
Brother, let's go.

201
00:21:14,110 --> 00:21:16,040
You go back first.

202
00:21:16,040 --> 00:21:18,570
I want to play a song for him.

203
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:58,350
Jingxuan, follow me.

204
00:21:58,350 --> 00:22:00,860
I'll take you to the outside world.

205
00:22:04,410 --> 00:22:08,830
I didn't really remove his memories.

206
00:22:08,830 --> 00:22:11,810
We agreed.

207
00:22:11,810 --> 00:22:14,650
He said he didn't want to forget me.

208
00:22:15,920 --> 00:22:22,370
But I didn't think he wanted to bring me.

209
00:22:23,850 --> 00:22:29,450
A disaster was forged from then on.

212
00:22:38,260 --> 00:22:40,910
Later, I realized

213
00:22:40,910 --> 00:22:47,020
Nan Yu Fu hoped the spirit host's body

214
00:22:47,020 --> 00:22:50,070
could produce a drug

215
00:22:50,070 --> 00:22:53,370
to let humans survive in Ghostdom,

216
00:22:53,370 --> 00:23:01,220
achieving his big plot. I hope you can defeat Nan Yu Fu

217
00:23:01,220 --> 00:23:05,810
to rebuild Mingjing Village.
