00:00:06,890 --> 00:00:09,630
Actually, the Ghostdom has records in Human world.

3
00:00:09,630 --> 00:00:13,320
Emperor Ru Shi had sent his servant to Penglai Island to seek for blessings.

4
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:16,790
There is the door that connected Human world and Ghostdom.

5
00:00:16,790 --> 00:00:21,460
The air in Ghostdom is poison to human. But there were also a very few people accidentally entered Ghostdom,

6
00:00:21,460 --> 00:00:25,070
got adapted to the environment in Ghostdom and evolved.

7
00:00:25,070 --> 00:00:30,610
And in the end, settled down here and reproduced.

8
00:00:30,610 --> 00:00:35,030
After that, these people continued to live generations by generations in Ghostdom.

9
00:00:35,030 --> 00:00:38,860
They are called spirits. There are many races in spirits.

10
00:00:38,860 --> 00:00:41,790
And compared to human beings, their phenotypes differ even more.

11
00:00:41,790 --> 00:00:45,050
So, everyone looks odd.

12
00:00:45,930 --> 00:00:50,360
Of course, there are also spirits that look no different from human beings.

13
00:00:50,360 --> 00:00:53,550
Since they are all human beings in the beginning.

14
00:00:53,550 --> 00:00:59,100
But, because of the special water and soil in Ghostdom, spirits are easy to mutate,

15
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:03,110
mutate into those strong but wicked evil spirits.

16
00:01:07,330 --> 00:01:10,550
To you, Ghostdom is a new world.

17
00:01:10,550 --> 00:01:14,520
World view this kind of thing also couldn't be explained in a few words.

18
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:16,220
Wait a second.

19
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:22,050
If you meet this, then you'll know everything.

20
00:01:23,170 --> 00:01:27,160

23
00:01:41,460 --> 00:01:43,700
That thick?

24
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:54,000
Rakshasa Street

25
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,380
Episode 3

26
00:03:19,470 --> 00:03:21,080
Stop!

27
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:24,610
Who are you?

28
00:03:24,610 --> 00:03:26,930
Stop being nosy.

29
00:03:26,930 --> 00:03:30,530
I'm the requiem general of this street. What do you say?

30
00:03:30,530 --> 00:03:34,550
Ok, we heard that as long as we kill you,

31
00:03:34,550 --> 00:03:38,820
this street is ours. Go.

32
00:03:42,020 --> 00:03:44,990
There's also fire weapons? Go.

33
00:03:55,890 --> 00:04:00,280
You can enter Chilian street, so

34
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:02,680
you must also be a spirit host.

35
00:04:13,590 --> 00:04:17,550
Correct. I'm also a spirit host.

36
00:04:18,410 --> 00:04:22,010
Who said punches can't be fire?

37
00:04:22,010 --> 00:04:26,030
Sorry, my target was Rakshasa street.

38
00:04:26,030 --> 00:04:28,640
But Chilian street is just beside Rakshasa street,

39
00:04:28,640 --> 00:04:33,180
what if you report about what happens in Rakshasa street by then?

40
00:04:33,180 --> 00:04:37,750
Then, that won't be suitable. You'll have to suffer,

41
00:04:37,750 --> 00:04:40,520
and die.

42
00:04:49,980 --> 00:04:53,030
This general pendant is quite pretty.

43
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:56,950
I'll leave it on me for now.

44
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:19,310
Sister, have some food.

45
00:05:20,550 --> 00:05:22,290
No need to wait for you brother?

46
00:05:22,290 --> 00:05:25,050
No need, he won't come back that quickly.

47
00:05:25,050 --> 00:05:28,170
It's not good to go on Rakshasa street now.

48
00:05:28,170 --> 00:05:33,400
He will definitely choose to travel in the human world, and then find an entrance to get to Rakshasa street.

49
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:36,700
The city has so much food. How can he not be full?

50
00:05:36,700 --> 00:05:39,230
I really envy you.

51
00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:46,390
I will make use of my Heaven-defying imagination!

52
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:16,390
- I'm full.   - Huh?

53
00:06:17,790 --> 00:06:21,720
- Hurry and eat yours. Children don't know a woman's appetite.   - Oh.

54
00:06:24,290 --> 00:06:29,120
Xiao Liang, you're so young. Do you cook by yourself?

55
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:31,780
My brother never does house work.

56
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:35,310
I have to cook and do the laundry.

57
00:06:35,310 --> 00:06:37,130
Narcissist.

58
00:06:37,130 --> 00:06:39,420
Sister, what did you say?

59
00:06:39,420 --> 00:06:40,910
Nothing.

60
00:06:41,420 --> 00:06:46,520
But is there only you and your brother at home? Where's your dad and mom?

61
00:06:56,690 --> 00:07:01,440
After taking this photo, dad and mom got in a car accident, then passed away.

62
00:07:04,790 --> 00:07:08,660
That day, older brother wanted to buy One Piece (manga anime).

63
00:07:08,660 --> 00:07:13,440
But dad said it was expensive so he kept having this face.

64
00:07:18,010 --> 00:07:21,620
What's wrong with you? We're taking a picture and you look miserable. Is your dad dead?

65
00:07:21,620 --> 00:07:25,050
How can you curse yourself to die?

66
00:07:25,050 --> 00:07:28,450
It's just a toy. Just give it to him.

67
00:07:31,640 --> 00:07:33,490
It's expensive.

68
00:07:33,490 --> 00:07:36,670
I look down you. Let's go.

69
00:07:37,640 --> 00:07:38,980
Come.

70
00:07:41,650 --> 00:07:45,710
Alright, don't be mad. Dad will bring you to buy your toy, okay?

71
00:07:45,710 --> 00:07:49,120
Bing Bing, dad said he'll bring you to buy toys.

72
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:51,090
Give a smile to dad.

73
00:07:51,750 --> 00:07:55,320
Silly smile. Let's go.

74
00:07:56,010 --> 00:07:59,400
But they got into an accident.

75
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:02,410
Brother, was lucky enough to live.

76
00:08:02,410 --> 00:08:05,240
But dad and mom's matter...

77
00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:14,850
We constables are deeply sorry about

78
00:08:14,850 --> 00:08:18,860
the accident happened to General Cao.

79
00:08:18,860 --> 00:08:25,070
From this day forward, you will be the requiem general of Rakshasa street.

80
00:08:25,070 --> 00:08:29,050

Still escape...

83
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:07,730
Let go of that girl.

84
00:09:21,300 --> 00:09:25,650
This street, I'm in charge. Let's see who else will mess around.

85
00:09:25,650 --> 00:09:28,970
I'll promise them that they'll regret. Get lost!

86
00:09:36,740 --> 00:09:38,240
What's your name?

87
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:41,890
-My name is Xia Ling.  -My name is Cao Yan Bing.

88
00:09:41,890 --> 00:09:44,140
I'm the Requiem General here.

89
00:09:44,140 --> 00:09:45,330
Requiem General?

90
00:09:45,330 --> 00:09:48,990
As long as I'm here, you won't get bullied anymore.

91
00:09:55,340 --> 00:09:57,260
He woke up!

92
00:09:57,260 --> 00:10:01,300
Hurry and leave!

93
00:10:17,140 --> 00:10:19,770
I'm Yu Jin, my Lord.

94
00:10:19,770 --> 00:10:22,560
I'll go through fire and water for Cao's generations.

95
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:24,940
I have a spirit host.

96
00:10:24,940 --> 00:10:27,870
Older Brother has the first spirit host, Yu Jin.

97
00:10:27,870 --> 00:10:31,330
He became known as the Requiem General of Rakshasa street.

98
00:10:31,330 --> 00:10:36,260
But a year later, a group of violent strange people came

99
00:10:36,260 --> 00:10:38,360
Xiao Long died.

100
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:43,070
Yu Jin risked his life to kill the enemy. He also died in the battle.

101
00:10:46,350 --> 00:10:49,760
Sorry, I didn't know.

102
00:10:51,970 --> 00:10:53,620
What?

103
00:10:55,310 --> 00:10:57,010
Sister, say here and don't move.

104
00:10:57,010 --> 00:10:58,600
What's wrong?

105
00:10:58,600 --> 00:11:01,000
There are demons.

106
00:11:02,150 --> 00:11:07,600
Wherever you came from, there you will return.

107
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:12,800
If you take one more step, I won't go easy

Tang Liu Yu

109
00:11:43,820 --> 00:11:45,390
He did not evaporate.

He is a spirit host.

- Uncle Zhong?   - Xiao Liang,

112
00:11:59,750 --> 00:12:01,410
hurry and leave.

113
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:14,880
Even though I'm not familiar with your face, but based on your personally,

114
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:18,930
you should be the younger brother, Cao Xuan Liang.

115
00:12:18,930 --> 00:12:21,970
Murdering a requiem general is a felony. Don't you know that?

116
00:12:21,970 --> 00:12:26,410
It was clearly you who hit him a bit, don't blame it on me.

117
00:12:26,410 --> 00:12:28,750

121
00:12:37,930 --> 00:12:41,160
It seems our organization has quite a reputation outside.

122
00:12:41,910 --> 00:12:45,330
Little kid, do you have any last words?

123
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:09,130
Eight-legged Mantis Tang Liu Yu, blind in both eyes, yet able to discern people's position with his hearing.

124
00:13:09,130 --> 00:13:13,150
He is famous for using the sect's strange, hidden weapon. In order to seize the strongest weapon,

125
00:13:13,150 --> 00:13:17,390
he betrayed the Tang sect, and massacred the 400 plus disciples of the sect in one night.

126
00:13:17,390 --> 00:13:20,940
He used such a ruthless method. Later he grew a conscience,

127
00:13:20,940 --> 00:13:23,710
he retreated from society.

128
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:27,270
What a vicious and violent guardian spirit.

129
00:13:27,270 --> 00:13:30,800
Such a little kid like you, if I don't get rid of you earlier,

130

If I come kill you, Tang Liu Yu will die.

157
00:16:45,540 --> 00:16:50,910
While we waste time here, Tang Liu Yu will die. If you try to run,

158
00:16:50,910 --> 00:16:55,980
when the distance between the spirit host and guardian spirit is too far, the guardian spirit will weaken.

159

Tang Liu Yu will die even sooner.

they still belong in the realm of mortals.

00:18:16,090 --> 00:18:19,750
Any last words, child?

178
00:18:19,750 --> 00:18:23,090
Dao Jing, start.

179
00:18:53,780 --> 00:18:56,680
Fury can increase one's strength.

180
00:18:56,680 --> 00:19:00,720
Unfortunately, even a rabbit at it's greatest limit, will still be unable to harm a wolf.

181
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:04,550
How was my acting?

182
00:19:04,550 --> 00:19:07,310
Tang Liu Yu truly is an amazing spirit.

183
00:19:07,310 --> 00:19:10,520
Spirit Tree and Tang Liu Yu!

184
00:19:11,310 --> 00:19:14,280
This time's harvest is quite fruitful.

185
00:19:14,280 --> 00:19:17,080
Dream on! I'll die before giving up my home.

186
00:19:17,080 --> 00:19:21,660
What a stupid boy. Of course you will be dying.

187
00:19:21,660 --> 00:19:25,300
Because, what we want, is only Tang Liu Yu.

188
00:19:25,300 --> 00:19:28,180
If the spirit host dies, the guardian spirit will also die!

189
00:19:28,180 --> 00:19:32,380
That's in the past, because we already found

190
00:19:32,380 --> 00:19:35,390
a way to separate away a guardian spirit.

191
00:19:39,070 --> 00:19:43,070
No need, young child with the surname Cao.

192
00:19:43,870 --> 00:19:47,090
You want to die first? That's fine too.

193
00:19:47,090 --> 00:19:48,860
Guardian spirit!

194
00:19:52,020 --> 00:19:55,940
-You broke down my wall, you beat up my brother, you terrified my woman. -Hey!

195
00:19:55,940 --> 00:19:58,280
What are you trying to do here?

196
00:20:03,080 --> 00:20:06,320
If the spirit host dies, the guardian spirit also dies!

197
00:20:11,870 --> 00:20:13,830
That is,

198
00:20:14,460 --> 00:20:16,840
the light that connects the worlds

199
00:20:18,190 --> 00:20:21,440
Master, the mission is complete.

200
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:38,960
Here's the replay

201
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:42,470
Little dancing prince

202
00:20:46,460 --> 00:20:49,400
Three, two, one, go!

203
00:21:02,520 --> 00:21:05,110
Again, one, two, three.

204
00:21:27,080 --> 00:21:33,830
♬  When earth and heaven become blurred, the beautiful becomes demonic,  ♬

205
00:21:33,830 --> 00:21:40,590
♬  swallowing the maelstrom of the soul's desires  ♬

206
00:21:40,590 --> 00:21:46,180
♬  You ask me why I still persist,  ♬

207
00:21:46,180 --> 00:21:49,240
♬  why I don't surrender  ♬

208
00:21:49,240 --> 00:21:56,070
♬   to the shining, golden shackles  ♬

209
00:21:56,070 --> 00:22:02,530
♬  Even when everyone has been reduced to a powerless puppet,  ♬

210
00:22:02,530 --> 00:22:08,530
♬  we cannot give up our world to those flashy, hypocritical scum  ♬

211
00:22:08,530 --> 00:22:11,680
♬  Throw away your fears and prepare your strength  ♬

212
00:22:11,680 --> 00:22:15,300
♬  Even if the heavens don't distinguish right from wrong,  ♬

213
00:22:15,300 --> 00:22:18,520
♬  I vow to forever protect the fortress   ♬

214
00:22:18,520 --> 00:22:24,500
♬  of our freedom, without giving in  ♬

215
00:22:24,500 --> 00:22:27,860
♬   I will become a monument of a hero.   ♬

216
00:22:27,860 --> 00:22:35,160
♬  Take all of our sins and burn them to ashes  ♬

217
00:22:35,160 --> 00:22:41,890
♬  Too many people have already become puppets under their control  ♬

218
00:22:41,890 --> 00:22:48,330
♬  Even when everyone has been reduced to a powerless puppet,  ♬

219
00:22:48,330 --> 00:22:54,280
♬  we cannot give up our world to those flashy, hypocritical scum  ♬

220
00:22:54,280 --> 00:22:57,500
♬  Take all of our sins   ♬

221
00:22:57,500 --> 00:23:01,930
♬   and burn them to ashes  ♬

222
00:23:01,930 --> 00:23:07,290
