1
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:10,000
What? The hunters were all killed?

2
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:11,600
Right.

3
00:00:11,600 --> 00:00:13,610
These hunters

4
00:00:13,610 --> 00:00:16,400
all have Tapana level capability.

5
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:21,400
I thought they would get Cao Yan Bing from Xiang Kunlun.

6
00:00:21,400 --> 00:00:24,800
Master, based on the scene,

7
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:28,200
these hunters were not killed by Xiang Kun Lun.

8
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:30,400
Xian Kun Lun has already returned to Heroes Hall.

9
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:33,200
He doesn't have Cao Yan Bing by his side.

10
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:36,800
Also, there's one corpse missing from the group.

11
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:38,800
It seems that he was able to get away.

12
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:43,800
- Who is it?   - He is called as Silver Spear Master, Zhao Xin.

13
00:01:40,010 --> 00:01:47,980
 Timing and Subtitles brought by The Spiritual Guardians @ Viki  

14
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:55,000
  [Rakshasa Street]  

15
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
 - Episode 9 - 

16
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:13,700
Say something.

17
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:17,100
I have nothing to say to deserters like you.

18
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:21,300
It's Mr. Gui who made you unconscious, not me.

19
00:02:21,300 --> 00:02:23,200
I said the team is dismissed!

20
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:24,400
Hey.

21
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:30,000
Go back to school to do your defense dissertation.

22
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,600
You're free now.

23
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:33,200
Cao Yan Bing!

24
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:36,700
Excuse me, the total is $120. You still owe $20.

25
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:41,430
We can take mobile payment, too.

26
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:49,700
 Cao Yan Bing! Stop! 

27
00:02:52,750 --> 00:02:54,380
 Cao Yan Bing! 

28
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:07,000
If I'm an ordinary person, I don't know how many times you would've killed me already!

29
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
I know you're not an ordinary person.

30
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,800
Are you crazy?!

31
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:14,400
- What do you mean? At the time it was you who said...  - I really regret it!

32
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:17,600
I should have said two moves! You should get a sense of your current condition.

33
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:19,800
You can go with us is because of Guifu Santong.

34
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:22,400
I can't win against Guifu Santong and you can't win against me. Do you understand?!

35
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:26,000
Mr. Gui has just died and you react like this. Aren't you a bit too much?

36
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,800
Tang Sheng is gone.

37
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:30,800
I'm returning to Mount Huaguo, you should return from where you came from. Okay?

38
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:34,100
If it wasn't for me, you would've been beaten to death by Xiang Kun Lun!

39
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:39,400
Are you proud of selling your charms?

40
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:42,700
I didn't sell my charms. On top of that,

41
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:46,800
being beautiful is also a skill.

42
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:50,000
Then it must have the premise of everyone's aesthetic standard and be as problematic as Xiang Kun Lun.

43
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:53,200
- You're crazy!   - Then don't follow someone who's crazy!

44
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:54,600
Cao Yan Bing!

45
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Seems like I really should wipe your memory.

46
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,400
Cao Yan Bing!

47
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:06,000
Why is it you again?

48
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,400
If you attack the dog, you also have to look at the owner.

49
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:08,800
Li Xuan Yuan.

50
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:11,200
Also, hitting Master,

51
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:14,000
why don't you look at who her guardian spirit is?

52
00:04:15,300 --> 00:04:17,200
You think you can beat Xu Chu?

53
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:21,200
At Rakshasa Street, probably not, but this is the human world now.

54
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:25,800
Based on Xu Chu's size, your Xu Chu only appears for one second here...

55
00:04:32,070 --> 00:04:35,890
He has so much trouble coming out himself, yet he dares talk down on others?

56
00:04:38,900 --> 00:04:42,800
Memories are such precious things, how can you just take them away as you please?

57
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:44,600
- It's because... - Because what?

58
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:47,600
Is it because you're the requiem general? Is it because you can fight?

59
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:50,600
Is it because there is a big hunk general living in your body?

60
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:52,400
I hit you a bit and you can restore yourself really quickly.

61
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:55,300
But if you're going to hit my head, what happens if I become a vegetable?

62
00:04:56,200 --> 00:04:57,200
You have to trust my experience.

63
00:04:57,200 --> 00:05:00,200
Cao Yan Bing, have you ever respected others?

64
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:03,600
You are arrogant, cocky, your whole body is covered with the smell of terminal straight men cancer.

65
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:05,800
You are male dominance; you've never considered others.

66
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:07,800
You never trusted your own partner!

67
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:10,200
Ha-ha, you can even start talking about character now?

68
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:14,600
How about you? What can you do? Aren't you just calling out your guardian spirit just for selfies?

69
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:17,400
If a requiem street has internet, I think you'd have already posted in your moments!

70
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:21,000
Fighting whatever; you can do nothing at all!

71
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,800
I'm telling you. I won't open your brain

72
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:27,900
and I won't erase your memory. Remembering too many things will be a burden in life.

73
00:05:27,900 --> 00:05:31,200
A memory that doesn't need to be kept, you can keep whatever you like!

74
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,300
Lunatic.

75
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:49,200
 It's you? 

76
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:52,600
  What are you doing? 

77
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:55,100
 Posession! 

78
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,600
  Pervert! 

79
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:59,800
  She's not a person.  

80
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:01,600
 Is there not anyone who keeps order here?   

81
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:03,300
-  Who?   - Me. 

82
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:13,600
  Thank you 

83
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:15,600
  - Stupid girl!  - Cao Yan Bing!  

84
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:17,300
  Partner? 

85
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:20,400
  Cao Yan Bing!  

86
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:38,400
I'm always the landlord; it's already getting annoying.

87
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:41,400
I miss the days where we played Mahjong.

88
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:43,400
We have no choice, Xia Ling isn't here.

89
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:47,400
There's only three of us here. Say, why is Xia Ling so busy all the time?

90
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:49,400
Going out to travel everyday.

91
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,300
The Mahjong is home.   ( Xia Ling is home) 

92
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:15,000
- Master! - Hello. I' meeting you again in my dreams.

93
00:07:16,100 --> 00:07:18,400
You're laughing at me, Master.

94
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:22,200
But thank you just then. If it wasn't because of you,

95
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:25,200
this head of mine would've been opened again.

96
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:29,200
What words are those? I'm your guardian spirit.

97
00:07:30,100 --> 00:07:32,300
Protecting you is my honor.

98
00:07:32,300 --> 00:07:34,800
Cao Yan Bing, that crazy person.

99
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:37,200
He's talking like I'm willing to follow him.

100
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:40,000
I'm clearly saving the world.

101
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:43,600
Actually, this matter I always questioned about.

102
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:45,900
Why would you question it?

103
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:49,000
If our world and Rakshasa Street connected,

104
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,200
then everyone will be poisoned.

105
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:55,000
My father, mother, grandparents, my aunts, my friends, and my classmates,

106
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:59,000
In this whole world only I can save them! Of course, I'd care so much!

107
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,900
This is precisely my question.

108
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:03,800
Rakashasa Street and the human world.

109
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:05,800
Of the twelve spirit trees,

110
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:08,000
at least 6 of them need to be destroyed.

111
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,800
This is only the first one.

112
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:14,400
Also, why doesn't Master believe that Cao Yan Bing can get back the sprout of the Spirit Pagoda tree?

113
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:17,200
He is a requiem general of Rashasa Street.

114
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:21,400
The Spirit Pagoda tree was originally something that belonged at his place.

115
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:23,800
You are questioning my instincts?

116
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:27,900
Master, you misunderstand me. I just feel

117
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:31,800
that there are some unknown factors.

118
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:37,380
Right now, I am actually questioning your instincts.

119
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:41,799
I just want to more accurately figure out what is in your heart.

120
00:08:41,799 --> 00:08:44,199
What Master wants me to do.

121
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:50,300
Even if I die, I'll help Master achieve your goal.

122
00:08:57,800 --> 00:09:01,380
Then, I'll ask you a question. You must answer honestly.

123
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:03,100
Please say it, Master.

124
00:09:03,100 --> 00:09:04,980
If I keep staying in the human world,

125
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,700
will this Heart Chain have a chance to be broken?

126
00:09:08,700 --> 00:09:11,700
Do I still have a chance to see you often?

127
00:09:13,980 --> 00:09:15,440
No, you can't.

128
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:18,400
No matter what, I am still a spirit.

129
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:22,600
The air in the human world is also harmful to me.

130
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:27,600
Coming out once in a while is fine but if I keep staying in the human world, I'm afraid

131
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:29,800
I will enter a hibernating state.

132
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:33,900
If you were to stay continuously in the human world, how long can you sustain yourself?

133
00:09:33,900 --> 00:09:35,800
About ten days or so.

134
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:38,900
This is also related to Master's situation.

135
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:44,700
If it is like that, then our world will be dangerous,

136
00:09:44,700 --> 00:09:46,800
and Li Xuan Yuan will also be in danger.

137
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:51,000
Based on what he said, the world won't be destroyed in a short time.

138
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:54,200
But after ten days, he will go into hibernation!

139
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:56,000
We can't do this.

140
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,800
Li Xuan Yuan, listen carefully.

141
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:03,500
From now on, don't question anymore my sense of justice.

142
00:10:03,500 --> 00:10:06,400
Because to the matter of retaking a Sacred Pagoda sprout,

143
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:08,200
I'm determined.

144
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:10,000
Okay, Master.

145
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,200
Just now when I materialized to block Cao Yan Bing,

146
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:17,000
I grabbed the chance and stole his map. It's in your pocket right now.

147
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,800
Really?

148
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:23,400
- So, Cao Yan Bing needs to bring you to travel.   - Yes!

149
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:42,300
This Li Xuan Yuan, though he looks so honest, can actually pick pockets!

150
00:10:43,940 --> 00:10:45,890
Cao Yan Bing.

151
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:54,000
It's you.

152
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:02,200
Let's switch locations, and properly settle this.

153
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:17,100
I would eventually look for you. Why are you so impatient?

154
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:22,600
The setting moon waits for no one, and I don't wait for you.

155
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:27,400
The moon today is really far away. It's the most suitable day to kill people.

156
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:30,200
I won't deny it.

157
00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:34,400
Master, what's wrong?

158
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:38,700
Nothing, I feel like two people are trying to pretend to be sick.

159
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:44,400
While you still live, let me ask you. Where is Guifu Santong?

160
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:46,300
Who's Guifu Santong?

161
00:11:46,300 --> 00:11:50,000
Don't joke with me. He's the guy you all ganged up on.

162
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,400
The one who is joking is you.

163
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:55,800
Old Gui, I will slowly avenge you.

164
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:59,200
I'll first just avenge the first 1/7th portion.

165
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:07,200
There's movements. I feel like nearby

166
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:09,700
there are two powerful spirit hosts.

167
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:11,900
What?

168
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:17,200
If there's spirit hosts, how is it related to me?

169
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:06,800
 Master, it's right in front. 

170
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:32,100
Be careful.

171
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:40,000
I never thought there'd be the day I'd be fighting along side with you.

172
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,600
Master's partner is my partner.

173
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:44,800
Thanks for taking care.

174

Let it be spirit host and spirit host; guardian spirit and guardian spirit.

175

I look forward to your teaching me.

176
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:57,200
Hey! Can't you let your guy hold on a bit longer?

177
00:13:57,200 --> 00:14:00,200
I'm sorry. I am already trying my best.

178
00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:04,600
 This is called, "Breath!"

181

182
00:14:21,130 --> 00:14:25,320
Talk! Who ordered you to come here?

183
00:14:27,180 --> 00:14:29,810
I have a limit to my patience.

184
00:14:42,020 --> 00:14:45,540
Just now, weren't you being really arrogant?

185
00:14:45,540 --> 00:14:50,130
Look at how you are being scared, but

186
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:53,510
this time it's real.

187
00:15:01,810 --> 00:15:05,550
I'll give another chance and answer me honestly.

188
00:15:05,550 --> 00:15:08,350
Who sent you here? Where is the Spirit Pagoda sprout?

189
00:15:08,350 --> 00:15:10,920
Otherwise, I'll make you drink a toast with this sulphuric acid!

190
00:15:10,920 --> 00:15:14,460
We know that you did it based on someone's order.

191
00:15:14,460 --> 00:15:19,330
As long as you tell us information about where the Spirit Pagoda sprout is, we will immediately let you go.

192
00:15:19,330 --> 00:15:21,220
Spirit Pagoda sprout?

193
00:15:22,250 --> 00:15:24,500
What is that?

194
00:15:26,690 --> 00:15:29,190
Are you talking about a tree?

195
00:15:30,690 --> 00:15:32,940
Weren't you the one who destroyed it in the first place?

196
00:15:32,940 --> 00:15:35,000
Why are you asking me for information?

197
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,260
Aren't you the Kingdom organization's person?

198
00:15:37,260 --> 00:15:40,770
You're talking about the organization made up of spirit hosts?

199
00:15:40,770 --> 00:15:43,740
Answer my first question! Who ordered you to come here?

200
00:15:44,680 --> 00:15:48,830
It's in my pocket. Get it yourself.

201
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:52,180
Because of this?

202
00:15:52,180 --> 00:15:55,960
Quit spouting nonsense! If not for the bounty, then what?

203
00:15:55,960 --> 00:15:58,110
I'm a bounty hunter!

204
00:16:00,270 --> 00:16:03,980
If it's the Kingdom organization, then they wouldn't need the bounty.

205
00:16:04,920 --> 00:16:08,420
If it's a bounty hunter, then he shouldn't kill Old Gui.

206
00:16:08,420 --> 00:16:09,760
That's right.

207
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:12,500
The person yesterday who was blocking you, how is he? Is he still alive?

208
00:16:12,500 --> 00:16:14,760
He's not on the bounty.

209
00:16:15,870 --> 00:16:19,840
We bounty hunters never randomly kill people.

210
00:16:24,350 --> 00:16:28,680
 If I don't kill you, will you still go catch Cao Yan Bing? 

211
00:16:28,680 --> 00:16:32,620
 I will. So you better kill me. 

212
00:16:32,620 --> 00:16:34,370
 Interesting. 

213
00:16:35,050 --> 00:16:39,400
 How about let's do a trade? After you find Cao Yan Bing, 

214
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:43,910
 if you win, tell him I died. 

215
00:16:43,910 --> 00:16:46,180
 If you lose, 

216
00:16:47,100 --> 00:16:49,870
 then tell him I'm still alive. 

217
00:16:50,860 --> 00:16:55,040
 But you better not mention the name Huangfu Longdou. 

218
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:58,920
 Interesting. But why? 

219
00:17:00,230 --> 00:17:03,620
 So that you don't become a corpse. 

220
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:20,670
- He is still alive.  - Yes!

221
00:17:20,670 --> 00:17:23,579
I knew that Mr. Gui wouldn't die that easily.

222
00:17:23,579 --> 00:17:26,029
You knew? When did you know?

223
00:17:26,030 --> 00:17:27,600
It's not important.

224
00:17:28,109 --> 00:17:30,520
It's just a misunderstanding. Help him untie this.

225
00:17:30,520 --> 00:17:33,490
This person, it's better to kill him so we can be safe.

226
00:17:33,490 --> 00:17:37,900
He didn't even kill Mr. Gui, and you want to kill him? Aren't requiem generals forbidden from random slaughter?

227
00:17:37,900 --> 00:17:39,510
I'm just joking. Why are you so nervous for?

228
00:17:39,510 --> 00:17:42,800
But you better kill me.

229
00:17:43,620 --> 00:17:46,420
Because I will still catch you.

230
00:17:48,010 --> 00:17:49,710
Saying it that way,

231
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:53,530
it's quite reasonable.

232
00:18:03,990 --> 00:18:06,600
You will regret it.

233
00:18:08,740 --> 00:18:12,350
Inside his eyes, he didn't even blink a bit.

234
00:18:12,350 --> 00:18:15,460
He is indeed a tough guy.

235
00:18:15,460 --> 00:18:17,930
Maybe he has really slow reactions?

236
00:18:31,780 --> 00:18:34,950

your son didn't let me down.

240
00:18:48,840 --> 00:18:55,130
It's just that, what if that fellow doesn't want to assist, Sir?

241
00:18:55,130 --> 00:18:59,440
Then isn't it feeding a tiger to your own detriment?

242
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:03,290
I've only thrown a stone into the sea.

243
00:19:04,010 --> 00:19:08,540
It doesn't matter who this stone belongs to.

244
00:19:08,540 --> 00:19:13,010
What's important is the ripple in the beginning,
