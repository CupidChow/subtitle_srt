Timing and Subtitles brought by The Spiritual Guardians @ Viki

2
00:00:24,380 --> 00:00:30,530
You submitted obediently for so long, but, in the end, you still chose the path of death.

3
00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:35,530
It's played out like this, there's nothing much more to say.

4
00:00:35,530 --> 00:00:38,210
Why did you choose Cao Yan Bing?

5
00:00:38,210 --> 00:00:44,870
Because he is the only one who is willing to step into that place since five years ago.

6
00:00:44,870 --> 00:00:47,380
Is it just that?

7
00:00:47,380 --> 00:00:52,060
He's not afraid of you guys. He's not afraid of anything.

8
00:00:52,060 --> 00:00:59,940
Only someone like him is possible to expel the darkness that shrouds this street.

9
00:00:59,940 --> 00:01:04,090
Master Zi Wei wants to see you personally.

10
00:01:05,750 --> 00:01:10,130
Sorry, you probably have no method to escape out of this darkness.

11
00:01:10,130 --> 00:01:13,610
And the savior you are counting on, Cao Yan Bing,

12
00:01:13,610 --> 00:01:18,720
is already heading down the death trap prepared for him.

13
00:01:20,010 --> 00:01:22,780
Is this place the death trap?

14
00:01:22,780 --> 00:01:27,330
As a ninja, you were even unaware that someone was approaching; really such an idiot  (Japanese) .

15
00:01:27,330 --> 00:01:30,640
This time you wear your clothes. Come on!

16
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:56,100
[Rakashasa Street]

17
00:02:56,100 --> 00:02:58,240
- Episode 15 -

18
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:05,830
Cao Yan Bing. Murderer, Sly Fox, Straight Men Carcinoma.

19
00:03:05,830 --> 00:03:08,110
Why do I have to listen to you?

20
00:03:11,090 --> 00:03:14,510
You are that... Master Nan, right? The main general of Spirit Armor Army.

21
00:03:14,510 --> 00:03:16,110
I am.

22
00:03:16,110 --> 00:03:20,120
I heard from the villagers about your magnificent feat of staying back to be hostage.

23
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:21,930
You are not inferior to men.

24
00:03:21,930 --> 00:03:23,510
No, no.

25
00:03:23,510 --> 00:03:25,290
Where's Cao Yan Bing?

26
00:03:25,290 --> 00:03:28,190
He... that...

27
00:03:46,180 --> 00:03:48,800
He just fainted. Nothing much.

28
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:50,810
Cao Yan Bing!

29
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:53,820
This mad violent man.

30
00:03:57,220 --> 00:03:58,950
Master Nan, Master Men.

31
00:03:58,950 --> 00:04:01,410
We heard a sound while we were nearby.

32
00:04:01,410 --> 00:04:04,860
Bring him back to the barracks, let the military doctor treat him.

33
00:04:04,860 --> 00:04:06,310
Yes.

34
00:05:33,010 --> 00:05:35,930
These villagers were like zombies yesterday.

35
00:05:35,930 --> 00:05:38,190
- How come now they're--   - Shh!

36
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:49,160
- Xia Ling, come with me. I have something to ask you.   - Oh.

37
00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:56,920
This is what happened. Cao Yan Bing was accused wrongly.

38
00:06:00,210 --> 00:06:05,070
I sincerely, without reservation, explain by swearing to the heavens,

39
00:06:05,070 --> 00:06:11,250
the Sacred Pagoda tree was fried by me!   How's that?

40
00:06:11,250 --> 00:06:13,310
This idiot.

41
00:06:13,310 --> 00:06:18,140
Cao Yan Bing is a descendant of Cao Cao. You should know this, right?

42
00:06:18,140 --> 00:06:21,830
"I prefer doing injustice to others than them doing injustice to me."

43
00:06:21,830 --> 00:06:26,220
Descendant of a wicked king, is his word reliable?

44
00:06:28,180 --> 00:06:33,420
You can't trust his words so you can't trust this either.

45
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:38,900
Has Cao Yan Bing erased your memories?

46
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:45,850
Being with him, your memories may not be complete.

47
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:51,600
It looks like I was right.

48
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:55,840
Although you are a spirit host, you were not called by Ghostdom to be a requiem general.

49
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:59,700
You should go back to the human world and live your life.

50
00:06:59,700 --> 00:07:05,610
And not stay with this convict to live a chased life.

51
00:07:08,100 --> 00:07:13,700
Old cadre... Why ask me to go back to the human world while I'm okay here?

52
00:07:13,700 --> 00:07:16,480
But it's almost the time for dissertation defense.

53
00:07:18,410 --> 00:07:20,490
Someone, someone! Hurry and look at Shui'er!

54
00:07:20,490 --> 00:07:21,570
What's wrong with Shui'er?

55
00:07:21,570 --> 00:07:23,380
Hurry, come over and see.

56
00:07:33,250 --> 00:07:35,020
What's wrong with Shui'er?

57
00:07:35,020 --> 00:07:37,740
I don't know. She suddenly fainted.

58
00:07:39,590 --> 00:07:41,480
How is she?

59
00:07:42,280 --> 00:07:45,930
You know, she's more serious than others.

60
00:07:46,980 --> 00:07:49,190
We can only wait for the Supreme Fruit.

61
00:08:05,790 --> 00:08:08,150
Where's the Sacred Pagoda sprout?

62
00:08:10,310 --> 00:08:14,650
I asked you one more time. Where's the Sacred sprout?

63
00:08:16,450 --> 00:08:20,900
I'm a ninja. What I'm best in is to be patient.

64
00:08:20,900 --> 00:08:24,450
Oh, be patient?

65
00:08:29,930 --> 00:08:31,810
Just do it.

66
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:49,000
Your mouth is really stubborn. It's a pity that you aren't a ninja.

67
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,900
Fat woman!

68
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:55,600
Ninja keeps silent.

69
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:58,200
You have a mouthful of lies,

70
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:02,200
but could also be used for keeping secrets.

71
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:08,400
Let me ask you. Am I pretty?

72
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:15,000
Your ugliness has surpassed my vocabulary knowledge!

73
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:30,600
Do you know,

74
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:35,400
because of you, we are able to test out

75
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:38,800
the method of making a human survive

76
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:41,400
under the environment of Ghostdom?

77
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:44,200
You have to know that,so much effort was spent

78
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:47,200
to bring them from the human world over here,

79
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:51,500
And even before the experiment was started, they have already died.

80
00:09:54,450 --> 00:09:56,410
It's something

81
00:09:56,410 --> 00:09:59,610
to make someone have a headache.

82
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:12,000
Here, tell me where the rest of the people are.

83
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:15,100
I know some of the people didn't die.

84
00:10:15,100 --> 00:10:19,800
They're just hiding like mice,

85
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:23,300
hiding in requiem streets' dirtiest place,

86
00:10:23,300 --> 00:10:26,000
and waiting to see the light of day again,

87
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:29,900
waiting for the injustice to be redressed.

88
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:37,600
But...

89
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:42,400
they can't speak, can't write.

90
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:45,800
Although their hearts have so much bitterness,

91
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:48,600
they can't tell a stranger anything.

92
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:51,300
Even if they said it,

93
00:10:51,300 --> 00:10:53,800
no one would trust them.

94
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,800
For such a sad and cruel life,

95
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:01,900
why should they continue?

96
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:06,000
Because they are all innocent!

97
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:10,300
The villagers in Ming Jing Village are not whatever demons at all!

98
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:14,600
The real demon is you guys!

99
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:16,400
They're innocent?!

100
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:18,600
Then, what about you? Are you innocent?!

101
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:21,600
Are you not guilty?! If not because of you,

102
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:25,500
would they turn out like this?

103
00:11:26,700 --> 00:11:28,600
Look, look.

104
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:32,200
If you didn't help us experiment this medicine,

105
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:37,000
you would already be stabbed to death.

106
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:42,800
But now, blood is dripping as easy as sweat.

107
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:55,700
There's still people using such an old technique.

108
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:05,800
Apparently, the Spirit Armor Army is together with you all.

109
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:07,400
You shouldn't have come.

110
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:10,600
Of course, I found out such a big secret.

111
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:14,400
Nan Yu Fu was blinded by you guys or he was totally together with you guys?

112
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:18,600
Curiosity can kill a cat. Did you ever hear about that?

113
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:20,400
There's also a lot of types of cats.

114
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:23,000
Oh, then what type are you?

115
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,800
The type that will eat you.

116
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:28,000
I'm so pretty. Can you bare to eat me?

117
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,800
I won't eat the ugly one.

118
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:32,200
You really can talk.

119
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:34,000
How about a trade?

120
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,070
You say it.

121
00:12:35,100 --> 00:12:38,200
I'll trade one from this side and you trade one from that side.

122
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:41,000
Based on what do you think I'll trade?

123
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,000
Such a strong ninja.

124
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:46,200
With such a powerful guardian spirit, exchange for a information seller,

125
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:48,500
I can't think of a reason why you wouldn't trade.

126
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:55,500
Also the way you look at him, then he must be important to you.

127
00:12:55,500 --> 00:12:59,200
It seems like I have no reason to reject you.

128
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:03,400
You!

129
00:13:07,300 --> 00:13:12,700
The injury that almost drives you to death, you can only sacrifice your life to pay back.

130
00:13:12,700 --> 00:13:15,700
You know that when you do that, you're killing two people!

131
00:13:15,700 --> 00:13:17,300
Oh?

132
00:13:17,300 --> 00:13:20,200
You killed your hostage, aren't you scared that I will kill mine?

133
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:22,700
Are you talking about Hattori?

134
00:13:22,700 --> 00:13:24,500
Please.

135
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:27,600
Isn't he your partner?

136
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:29,000
She's a ninja.

137
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,000
She went through fire and water for you.

138
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,600
She's a ninja.

139
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:34,000
She trusts you so much.

140
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,600
She's a ninja.

141
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:36,800
A ninja is also human!

142
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:39,800
I know, but she's a ninja.

143
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:44,400
Dying for this kind of matter, just bear with it for a bit and then it will pass.

144
00:13:45,500 --> 00:13:49,400
I know you never hit women.

145
00:13:49,400 --> 00:13:53,700
What? Do you want to hit me now?

146
00:13:53,700 --> 00:13:58,400
I don't hit woman but towards these kinds like you...

147
00:13:58,400 --> 00:13:59,700
Oh.

148
00:13:59,700 --> 00:14:01,000
...I will kill!

149
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,800
Is that so?

150
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:07,000
Let me see, how you'll kill me.

151
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,500
Xu Chu!

152
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:54,200
Under the Bodhi tree, people find peace.

153
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:55,600
Master Nan.

154
00:14:56,370 --> 00:14:59,370
Miss Xia, follow me.

155
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:08,930
I heard from Bei Luo that Miss Xia is going to return to the human world.

156
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:14,400
Because tomorrow is the day of the defense dissertation, I have to go back.

157
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:17,500
Does Master Nan know what a defense dissertation is?

158
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:20,400
I know. I'm also a spirit host.

159
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:23,000
I used to live in the human world.

160
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,700
Then, what about now? Do you not want to return to the human world anymore?

161
00:15:27,100 --> 00:15:30,800
I have duty here, it's hard to have time to go back.

162
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:34,400
After time, my status in the human world was fated,

163
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:38,000
and then disappeared. What's left

164
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,400
is my life in Ghostdom.

165
00:15:44,970 --> 00:15:48,390
Miss Xia, you're also a spirit host. Right?

166
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:51,600
I never saw Miss Xia's guardian spirit.

167
00:15:53,500 --> 00:15:59,000
My guardian spirit... sometimes works, sometimes doesn't.

168
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,200
Call out often, you will be skilled gradually.

169
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:02,400
It's not like that.

170
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:07,000
It's because my guardian spirit is locked by a Lock Heart Chain.

171
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,800
Even if he came out, the time is short.

172
00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:12,200
He's get pulled back by the Lock Heart Chain.

173
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:14,000
Lock Heart Chain?

174
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,600
Do you know what that is?

175
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:20,600
It's a suppressor. Used to bind the guardian spirit's strength.

176
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:24,900
Looks like Miss Xia's guardian spirit is not typical.

177
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:29,200
I also don't know.

178
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:34,000
It's just that when he appears, he seems quite reliable.

179
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:37,000
The problem is that he doesn't appear often.

180
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:41,600
If you don't mind, can I see Miss Xia's guardian spirit?

181
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:45,000
You can. Then, I'll try calling him out.

182
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,600
No need.

183
00:17:11,020 --> 00:17:13,090
Master Nan, what happened?

184
00:17:14,190 --> 00:17:15,080
Nothing.

185
00:17:15,080 --> 00:17:16,320
Master Nan... Master Nan!

186
00:17:16,320 --> 00:17:20,750
Master Nan, Shui'er doesn't look good. You need to quickly go look at her.

187
00:17:20,750 --> 00:17:22,170
Let's go.

188
00:17:28,260 --> 00:17:29,870
Be careful.

189
00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:41,250
Why are you like this?

190
00:17:41,250 --> 00:17:44,120
I don't have much time left.

191
00:17:47,480 --> 00:17:53,960
This restoration ability is done by sacrificing lifespans.

192
00:17:53,960 --> 00:17:56,580
I'm about to die soon.

193
00:17:59,160 --> 00:18:02,910
I'll bring you to a place.

194
00:18:02,910 --> 00:18:04,300
Here.

196
00:18:25,480 --> 00:18:26,850
What happened?

197
00:18:26,850 --> 00:18:28,740
Where did you go?

198
00:18:29,570 --> 00:18:30,890
I had some personal matters to take care of.

199
00:18:30,890 --> 00:18:32,670
What personal matters?

200
00:18:32,670 --> 00:18:36,010
I already said that it was personal matters.

201
00:18:38,290 --> 00:18:40,070
Cao Yan Bing came.

202
00:18:40,070 --> 00:18:42,360
How did he know this place?

203
00:18:42,360 --> 00:18:47,610
Little Bao bet on everything on Cao Yan Bing.

204
00:18:49,130 --> 00:18:54,370
I know after Cao Yan Bing saw those abandoned people  (villagers) , he would come back and find Little Bao again.

205
00:18:54,370 --> 00:19:00,630
So I let Hattori disguise into the shopkeeper to lead Cao Yan Bing to the preset trap.

206
00:19:00,630 --> 00:19:02,590
Right here?

207
00:19:02,590 --> 00:19:05,090
Of course not.

208
00:19:05,090 --> 00:19:10,750
Cao Yan Bing saw through Hattori, and he used her tricks and found Little Bao.

209
00:19:10,750 --> 00:19:15,910
After that, on Xiao Baozi's body he put in a bug device.

210
00:19:15,910 --> 00:19:18,600
So he found this place?

211
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:22,740
His Huchi is indeed not easy. We let him escape by accident.

212
00:19:22,740 --> 00:19:26,450
Anyway, no one will believe him.

213
00:19:26,450 --> 00:19:31,180
Tonight is the appearance of the Supreme Fruit, he wn't be able to cause any trouble.

214
00:19:31,180 --> 00:19:34,140
It's just... this brat is quite smart.

215
00:19:34,140 --> 00:19:40,820
It's probably hereditary. Since his ancestor was the top wicked king in the world.

216
00:19:42,910 --> 00:19:47,310
That gang of abandoned people, although they are insignificant,

217
00:19:47,310 --> 00:19:53,570
that legend... does cause some annoyance.

218
00:19:53,570 --> 00:19:59,920
Anyway, Cao Yan Bing is the descendant of Emperor Wu of Wei kingdom, not a descendant of Wu An  (Bai Qi) .

219
00:19:59,920 --> 00:20:02,770
Speaking of descendant of Wu An...

220
00:20:08,210 --> 00:20:11,060
Bai Shi Men...

221
00:20:13,230 --> 00:20:16,150
Bai Shi Men...

222
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:21,840
You can't open her head anymore.

223
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:23,720
Too many times.

224
00:20:25,180 --> 00:20:30,370
She must rely on herself. We can only wait until tonight, the appearance of the Supreme Fruit.

225
00:20:44,630 --> 00:20:46,540
Come. It's here.

226
00:21:01,590 --> 00:21:06,930
That partner of yours already came here before.

227
00:21:07,480 --> 00:21:13,500
The poison of hers was cured here.

228
00:21:36,510 --> 00:21:38,200
Who are they?

This story happened 5 years ago.

231
00:21:47,410 --> 00:21:49,270
Save me.

232
00:21:51,470 --> 00:21:57,500
He's so seriously injured. It's better to deliver him to the Bodhi tree.

233
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:03,620
Lofty like Mount Tai. Vast like the Yangtze river.

234
00:22:03,620 --> 00:22:08,010
My name is Bai Jing Xuan. Everyone's surnames in Mingjing Village are all Bai. ( White)

235
00:22:08,010 --> 00:22:13,520
Since I've been born, I've lived here. I've never seen the outside world.

236
00:22:16,050 --> 00:22:19,840
Jing Xuan, come with me.

237
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:22,320
I'll bring you to see the outer world.
