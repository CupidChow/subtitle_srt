00:00:06,060 --> 00:00:07,170
What is the spirit armor army?

3
00:00:07,170 --> 00:00:09,600
It's the mobile army affiliated with Ghostdom.

4
00:00:09,600 --> 00:00:11,950
How is it different compared to a requiem general?

5
00:00:11,950 --> 00:00:16,030
There are thousands of requiem generals. Some streets have a requiem general. Some don't.

6
00:00:16,030 --> 00:00:18,160
They only care about their street.

7
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:20,700
The requiem generals and Ghostdom have a trusting relationship.

8
00:00:20,700 --> 00:00:22,900
So Ghostdom doesn't have a way to mobilize the requiem generals.

9
00:00:22,900 --> 00:00:25,740
The spirit armor army is a division under Ghostdom.

10
00:00:25,740 --> 00:00:30,240
Most of the senior officers are spirit hosts. The soldiers are made up of spirits.

11
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:34,440
The requiem street without a requiem general, how come there isn't anyone to manage it?

12
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:36,480
If no one cares about it then it's alright.

13
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:39,070
If someone cares then that means you have to care.

14
00:00:39,070 --> 00:00:42,430
Some streets have been peaceful and auspicious for hundreds of years without any unusual people rebelling.

15
00:00:42,430 --> 00:00:44,930
Why would it need a requiem general?

16
00:00:44,930 --> 00:00:49,010
The places that need a requiem general the most are usually troublesome.

17
00:00:49,010 --> 00:00:52,140
I think your Rakshasa street has very scary people,

18
00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:55,020
a bit like a ghost town in a movie.

19
00:00:55,020 --> 00:00:58,320
Look at other people's Yulin street. It's completely auspicious and peaceful.

20
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:01,360
It's because Master Bei Luo Men is scarier than a ghost.

21
00:01:01,360 --> 00:01:04,260
I don't believe it. There's a requiem general more brutal than you?

22
00:01:04,260 --> 00:01:07,030
That's because you never saw how I look when I fight.

23
00:02:17,650 --> 00:02:21,490
Rakshasa Street

24
00:02:21,490 --> 00:02:23,560
Episode 14

25
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:32,360
[ The Most Wanted Man: Cao Yan Bing ]

26
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:34,870
Do you know where this person is?

27
00:02:36,530 --> 00:02:39,570
I don't know. Never saw him before.

28
00:02:44,420 --> 00:02:46,660
I already said I don't know.

29
00:02:47,190 --> 00:02:50,020
[ Map ]

30
00:02:50,020 --> 00:02:53,090
Look. It's right there.

31
00:03:02,650 --> 00:03:05,690
What about this lady?

32
00:03:05,690 --> 00:03:07,530
I never saw her.

33
00:03:07,530 --> 00:03:11,200
I definitely hear that they came here.

34
00:03:12,380 --> 00:03:14,500
I know.

35
00:03:18,310 --> 00:03:23,740
The former requiem general of Rakshasa street, a wanted criminal of Ghostdom - Cao Yan Bing

36
00:03:23,740 --> 00:03:24,990
Where is he?

37
00:03:24,990 --> 00:03:29,150
Follow me. I'll give you the directions.

38
00:03:30,860 --> 00:03:40,530
Timing and Subtitles brought to you by The Spiritual Guardians @ Viki

39
00:03:47,330 --> 00:03:50,830
There doesn't look like anyone lives here. Are you sure you have the right place?

40
00:03:50,830 --> 00:03:53,440
It's right. This is the place.

41
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:55,580
But it doesn't even look like a medicine shop.

42
00:03:55,580 --> 00:03:58,440
It's right that it doesn't look like a medicine shop

43
00:03:58,440 --> 00:04:00,870
What do you mean? What are you up to?

44
00:04:00,870 --> 00:04:04,100
I'm not playing tricks. It's the demons asking around.

45
00:04:04,100 --> 00:04:06,730
And for what's in his heart,

46
00:04:06,730 --> 00:04:08,620
I'm not really sure.

47
00:04:08,620 --> 00:04:10,120
Let's go.

48
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:35,570
May I ask, are you the doctor here?

49
00:04:37,780 --> 00:04:39,860
Even though I don't know what's happening right now,

50
00:04:39,860 --> 00:04:44,010
but I knock you out, I'll question you later.

51
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,830
It's you.

52
00:05:03,830 --> 00:05:08,140
I said that you will regret it for not killing me.

53
00:05:08,140 --> 00:05:09,520
Stupid girl.

54
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:11,930
Aiya, we aren't--

55
00:05:12,550 --> 00:05:14,650
Hurry and chase her. I'll take care of him.

56
00:05:14,650 --> 00:05:17,340
Me, chase her? Her teeth is so long.

57
00:05:17,340 --> 00:05:19,640
- Don't you have a man?   - That's right.

58
00:05:19,640 --> 00:05:22,000
- Hurry and go.   - I'm going.

59
00:05:23,150 --> 00:05:25,160
Stop right there!

60
00:05:26,830 --> 00:05:29,010
Wait a minute.

61
00:05:38,550 --> 00:05:40,870
Wait a minute.

62
00:05:53,750 --> 00:05:55,670
Li Xuan Yan.

63
00:06:05,860 --> 00:06:09,600
I didn't think that you were this despicable.

64
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:14,170
All's fair in war. What's the use in talking?

65
00:06:19,830 --> 00:06:21,790
I forgot to tell you that

66
00:06:21,790 --> 00:06:25,760
the spear you threw away has poison.

67
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:30,110
- Despicable.  - All's fair in war. What's the use in talking?

68
00:06:48,270 --> 00:06:52,090
Li Xuan Yan. Li Xuan Yan. Li Xuan Yan!

69
00:06:52,090 --> 00:06:54,420
Master. It's alright.

70
00:06:54,420 --> 00:06:56,800
I don't feel a deadly intent.

71
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:27,770
Why are you so obsessed with me? Is it only for the reward money?

72
00:07:30,170 --> 00:07:36,340
It turns out that issues about guardian spirits aren't fair either.

73
00:07:36,340 --> 00:07:37,720
What did you say?

74
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:41,950
Some guardian spirits' nature is to backup a tiger general.

75
00:07:41,950 --> 00:07:48,350
Some people spend a great deal of troubles, but can only get Zhangxiu.

76
00:07:48,350 --> 00:07:51,570
Is it Xuanwu Hou Zhangxiu?

77
00:07:52,950 --> 00:07:56,730
The spirit isn't like people. He has nothing to say.

78
00:07:56,730 --> 00:07:58,520
I think what you said is right.

79
00:07:58,520 --> 00:08:04,100
Last time I should've killed you but this time it isn't late either.

80
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:15,690
Houye...   (Zhao Xin's guardian spirit, Zhang Xiu's title)

81
00:08:20,150 --> 00:08:21,850
Houye...

82
00:08:27,460 --> 00:08:30,900
The spirit host and guardian spirit share life and death.

83
00:08:30,900 --> 00:08:36,020
If a spirit host doesn't have a guardian spirit, he'll be in an extremely difficult situation in Ghostdom, which is filled with unusual people.

84
00:08:36,020 --> 00:08:41,630
But a guardian spirit without a spirit host will lose rationality.

85
00:08:41,630 --> 00:08:44,210
Spirit hosts is a guardian spirit's other half

86
00:08:44,210 --> 00:08:46,910
and a guardian spirit is a spirit host's body.

87
00:08:46,910 --> 00:08:49,830
Spirit host and their own guardian spirit,

88
00:08:49,830 --> 00:08:54,390
the spirits have been linked to each other long ago.

89
00:08:54,390 --> 00:08:58,240
Someone's birth isn't important. What important is their effort for tomorrow.

90
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:01,160
You don't treat your guardian spirit as a partner but a weapon,

91
00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:04,280
it's useless even if the guardian spirit is stronger.

92
00:09:04,280 --> 00:09:07,660
Also, what about your guardian spirit?

93
00:09:07,660 --> 00:09:12,880
General Po Qiang, Xuanwu Hou Zhangxiu is my Wei general.

94
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:16,720
If you don't want it then return it to me.

95
00:09:29,210 --> 00:09:32,240
Houye, come back to recuperate.

96
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:42,590
Wait a minute.

97
00:09:45,580 --> 00:09:47,530
This is the antidote.

98
00:09:57,880 --> 00:10:03,160
Can you... help me find back my gun?

99
00:10:03,160 --> 00:10:04,590
It was thrown away by you.

100
00:10:04,590 --> 00:10:07,730
Okay. I promise you.

101
00:10:07,730 --> 00:10:09,510
I'll be back soon.

102
00:10:35,710 --> 00:10:39,680
A man must keep his promise. Why should I promise him?

103
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:45,000
Master, I didn't expect his guardian spirit is Xuanwu Hou Zhangxiu.

104
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,190
When you duel with him last time, did you not notice?

105
00:10:47,190 --> 00:10:49,320
It already passed about two thousand years.

106
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:53,110
Xuanwu Hou Zhangxiu is called the Spear god. He's Zhao Zi Long's older brother.

107
00:10:53,110 --> 00:10:56,340
Younger brother Dian Wei died in his hands.

108
00:10:56,340 --> 00:10:58,640
This old ancestor slept with my aunt,

109
00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:00,780
causing harm to his life.

110
00:11:19,890 --> 00:11:21,500
Xia Ling.

111
00:11:45,900 --> 00:11:47,750
Cao Yan Bing.

112
00:11:54,450 --> 00:11:56,370
Miss.

113
00:11:56,370 --> 00:11:59,010
Was is him that hurt you like this?

114
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:05,370
Help me.

115
00:12:12,420 --> 00:12:14,530
It's not me. It's not me who hurt you.

116
00:12:14,530 --> 00:12:16,790
I ask you was it him?

117
00:12:31,250 --> 00:12:33,100
What is this?

118
00:12:33,770 --> 00:12:37,120
Miss. Miss. Miss!

119
00:12:40,630 --> 00:12:43,770
The second I take my eyes off you, you kill innocents. You abuser!

120
00:12:43,770 --> 00:12:46,300
Women's benevolence make them stuck in hesitation!

121
00:12:46,300 --> 00:12:48,660
Overly sentimental.

122
00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:06,170
A perfect person turned out like this.

123
00:13:06,170 --> 00:13:10,790
You really are something. Can kill. Can bury.

124
00:13:10,790 --> 00:13:13,960
I explained already. The requiem general can weaken the unusual transformation of a spirit.

125
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:16,810
I also said that you're no longer a requiem general.

126
00:13:16,810 --> 00:13:18,450
I didn't want to kill her.

127
00:13:18,450 --> 00:13:20,240
I don't believe you.

128
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:23,280
Demonized spirits are disqualified to be a person.

129
00:13:23,280 --> 00:13:26,220
It's not limited to requiem general. Everyone can kill.

130
00:13:26,220 --> 00:13:29,930
The unusual people are strong. That's why you need a stronger requiem general to suppress them.

131
00:13:29,930 --> 00:13:34,900
She suddenly had an unusual transformation and attacked me. I was forced to defend myself.

132
00:13:34,900 --> 00:13:36,640
Then based on what you said,

133
00:13:36,640 --> 00:13:40,790
the person who just died is a pale-face, fanged monster.

134
00:13:40,790 --> 00:13:45,000
It's really strange. She briefly had an unusual transformation. Then her appearance was restored.

135
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:48,740
The reversibility of the gene mutation recovery is very low.

136
00:13:48,740 --> 00:13:52,560
What happened to you just then? When you chased her, you fainted here.

137
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:55,540
Don't change the topic.

138
00:13:56,580 --> 00:13:59,050
Then how is your wound better?

139
00:14:04,230 --> 00:14:06,470
Do you know what happened?

140
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:13,190
Bai Shi Men...

141
00:14:15,770 --> 00:14:18,440
Bai Shi Men...

142
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:28,240
Timing and Subtitles brought to you by The Spiritual Guardians @ Viki

143
00:14:33,930 --> 00:14:36,740
So you only remember scattered fragments.

144
00:14:36,740 --> 00:14:37,950
You don't remember anything else?

145
00:14:37,950 --> 00:14:42,520
Well... I was chasing and then suddenly a spear...

146
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:48,960
It's that. It's that!

147
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:51,490
But that's really weird.

148
00:14:51,490 --> 00:14:54,840
Why would that gun be there and suddenly fly back?

149
00:14:54,840 --> 00:14:58,100
The details aren't important. Give me the letter.

150
00:15:21,290 --> 00:15:23,850
Surprisingly, this paper doesn't burn.

151
00:15:35,020 --> 00:15:37,370
This paper's ability to absorb water is very good.

152
00:15:37,370 --> 00:15:39,010
There isn't changes in its weight.

153
00:15:39,010 --> 00:15:41,620
Not sure if it prevents leaking.

154
00:15:53,580 --> 00:15:57,360
Could it be that it doesn't work with the normal blood, but need special blood?

155
00:16:08,270 --> 00:16:10,800
Can't work with any kind of blood.

156
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:12,870
I have no more ideas.

157
00:16:13,590 --> 00:16:17,470
But I think, that person might know.

158
00:16:17,470 --> 00:16:18,880
Who?

159
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:21,020
The person who told us to come here.

160
00:16:31,890 --> 00:16:37,380
Owner, that customer who often sits right there, did he not come today?

161
00:16:37,380 --> 00:16:41,170
Oh, Xiao Bao? What a coincidence, he went home.

162
00:16:41,170 --> 00:16:44,310
Can you tell me where he lives? I have something important to ask him.

163
00:16:44,310 --> 00:16:47,030
At the alley of Qingyu Street.

164
00:16:49,050 --> 00:16:51,050
Thanks, Owner.

165
00:17:11,900 --> 00:17:13,800
That is definitely problematic.

166
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:16,800
Wait here for me.

167
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:20,400
I will watch you, so you can't indiscriminately kill the innocent.

168
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,600
- Hey!   - The clothes is too thick.

169
00:17:24,600 --> 00:17:27,200
I told you to wait here.

170
00:17:30,330 --> 00:17:33,950
Told you to wait here, so you won't block my way.

171
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:42,400
The partner we talked about...

172
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:55,600
[ Qi Ming is happening soon. ]

173
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:57,800
How do you say it?

174
00:17:57,800 --> 00:18:01,600
Supreme fruit is appearing soon, we need to be prepared.

175
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:05,600
I heard that child finally still failed to hold back anymore. How is he now?

176
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:07,600
He still doesn't talk.

177
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:11,800
That time when I saw his glance,

178
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:15,200
I knew that he wasn't sincerely submissive,

179
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:18,000
and have said that should get rid of the root as well.

180
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:21,800
Whether he is alive or not, it has nothing to do with the general situation anymore.

181
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:26,800
It's just considering that he did a great merit, so we spared his life.

182
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:31,000
I will take care of him personally and make him say it all out.

183
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,400
I have heard your means.

184
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:37,600
In front of you, there won't be lies.

185
00:18:38,750 --> 00:18:41,150
and there won't be survivors.

186
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:43,000
Where's Tai Wei?

187
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,800
Did we say to tell him to wait here for the good news?

188
00:18:45,800 --> 00:18:48,000
Let me go find him.

189
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:54,400
Here is the entrance to the Human world from Yulin Streer.

190
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:58,000
After you go out, you'll go back to the human world.

191
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:01,300
The things I told you, do you remember them?

192
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:19,600
Longdou, the youngsters you chose,

193
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:23,400
how exactly are the changes they will cause to the world?

194
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:27,200
I became really curious.

195
00:19:29,700 --> 00:19:32,620
The Supreme fruit is appearing soon.

196
00:19:33,500 --> 00:19:37,000
Right, when the Supreme fruit appears, the illness of Shui'er them is saved.

197
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:40,600
For this day, I already waited for five years.

198
00:19:40,600 --> 00:19:44,400
I won't allow anyone to take away the Supreme fruit.

199
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:48,100
The night when the Supreme fruit is produced, I will send Spirit Armor Army over here,

200
00:19:48,100 --> 00:19:49,800
to ensure it's perfectly saved.

201
00:19:49,800 --> 00:19:52,800
Are you worrying about The Plough Dragoon General?

202
00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:56,400
The Qi Ming of Bodhi Tree is originally a very secret matter.

203
00:19:56,400 --> 00:20:01,400
But previously the Sacred Pagoda is destroyed, the twelve spirit trees has entered a new cycle of Qi Ming.

204
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:03,800
Every force will sure inquire more information.

205
00:20:03,800 --> 00:20:06,600
But Ghostdom doesn't seem they care about this.

206
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:11,400
Spirits demonization is indeed a headache matter.

207
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:15,000
Ghostdom established requiem streets to gather all the spirits,

208
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:16,800
ease their life and death.

209
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:21,600
The twelve spirit trees stabilize the space, one or two are destroyed wouldn't cause serious problem.

210
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:24,400
If more are destroyed, causing turbulence in the space,

211
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:27,800
both requiem street and human world will plunge the people into misery and suffering.

212
00:20:27,800 --> 00:20:29,800
I only care about the Supreme fruit.

213
00:20:29,800 --> 00:20:33,400
To get the Supreme fruit, we have to guard the Bodhi Tree.

214
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:37,000
If the Plough Dragoon General comes to get the Supreme fruit,

215
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,400
they won't hurt the Bodhi Tree.

216
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:43,100
But there's a person who will harm the Bodhi Tree.

217
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,700
Are you talking about Cao Yan Bing?

218
00:20:45,700 --> 00:20:49,000
Initially I thought that Cao's househould guarded the Sacred Pagoda,

219
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,300
there's no reason for them to destroy Sacred Pagoda.

220
00:20:51,300 --> 00:20:54,800
But you had a fight with him,

221
00:20:54,800 --> 00:20:57,400
and said that he is a lawless and presumptuous person.

222
00:20:57,400 --> 00:21:00,800
So, we shouldn't ignore this person.

223
00:21:00,800 --> 00:21:05,300
I fought with him; I have confidence that I can surpass him.

224
00:21:05,300 --> 00:21:07,600
I heard before,

225
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:11,200
Cao Yan Bing's guardian spirit died when he was young.

226
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:14,800
He depended on his own strength and was able to suppress Rakshasa Street.

227
00:21:15,800 --> 00:21:17,600
But right now,

228
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:21,300
I heard that he has a new guardian spirit.

229
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:24,800
It's Huchi of Emperor Wu of Wei kingdom.

230
00:21:24,800 --> 00:21:26,500
Xu Chu?

231
00:21:27,900 --> 00:21:31,800
Such a kind of powerful general, if it becomes guardian spirit,

232
00:21:31,800 --> 00:21:34,400
it should be Tapana level.

233
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:38,400
My guardian spirit Shi Ling Ming was also Tapana level.

234
00:21:45,800 --> 00:21:48,500
[ The man under wanted warrant appears in Yulin Street ]

235
00:21:49,170 --> 00:21:51,890
Someone saw Cao Yan Bing's location.

236
00:21:52,600 --> 00:21:56,900
In this case, we don't need to prevent hm. We go find him.

237
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:19,600
[Preview]

238
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:24,600
Although you are a spirit host, you were not called by Ghostdom to be requiem general.

239
00:22:24,600 --> 00:22:28,300
You should go back to the human world and life your live.

240
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:35,600
The villagers in Ming Jing Village are not whatever demon at all!

241
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:37,800
Cao Yan Bing has seen through Hattori,

242
00:22:37,800 --> 00:22:41,400
used her trick and found Little Bao.

243
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:42,600
How about a trade?

244
00:22:42,600 --> 00:22:46,200
And the savior you counted on, Cao Yan Bing

245
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:51,000
is already starting his path to death.

246
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:52,500
Take 2.

247
00:22:53,800 --> 00:22:57,400
3,2,1, start.

248
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:05,600
Why are you so persistent in me? Just for the reward? [ Because you are handsome ]

249
00:23:06,700 --> 00:23:08,600
-AH!  -Good.

250
00:23:08,600 --> 00:23:12,200
Stab it hardly! I stab like this.

251
00:23:19,400 --> 00:23:20,600
Okay, cut.

252
00:23:22,800 --> 00:23:26,400
[ Pretend like nothing happen ]     [ Hahahaha ]

253
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:30,100
[Haha]   Did I scare you guys?

254
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:36,800
Who told us to be so experienced?

255
00:23:36,800 --> 00:23:39,000
That's good, we have no choice.

256
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,000
That's right. Who told us to be so experienced?

257
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:42,600
Okay, prepare.

258
00:23:42,600 --> 00:23:43,800
Like this, okay?

259
00:23:43,800 --> 00:23:47,400
Okay, prepare. This is good.

260
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:50,400
Actually, I'm very gentle. You all forced me to do this.

261
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:51,400
Take two.

262
00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:54,200
3,2,1, start.

263
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:55,700
Xia Ling.

264
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:04,000
Sorry...I'm pretty shy.

265
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,300
Once more.

266
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:16,600
♬  When earth and heaven become blurred, the beautiful becomes demonic,  ♬

267
00:24:16,600 --> 00:24:23,400
♬  swallowing the maelstrom of the soul's desires  ♬

268
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:28,800
♬  You ask me why I still persist,  ♬

269
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:39,000
♬  why I don't surrender to the shining, golden shackles  ♬

270

♬  Even when everyone has been reduced to a powerless puppet,  ♬

271
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:51,200
♬  we cannot give up our world to those flashy, hypocritical scum  ♬

272
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:54,300
♬  Throw away your fears and prepare your strength  ♬

273
00:24:54,300 --> 00:24:58,000
♬  Even if the heavens don't distinguish right from wrong,  ♬

274
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:04,000
♬  I vow to forever protect the fortress of our freedom.  ♬

275
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:10,600
♬  Without giving in, I will become a monument of a hero,  ♬

276
00:25:10,600 --> 00:25:18,300
♬  Take all of our sins and burn them to ashes  ♬

277
00:25:18,300 --> 00:25:24,800

♬  Even when everyone has been reduced to a powerless puppet,  ♬

279

♬  Take all of our sins and burn them to ashes  ♬

281
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:49,600
Rakshasa Street
