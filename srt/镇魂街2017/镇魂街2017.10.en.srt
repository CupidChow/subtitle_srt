00:00:01,020 --> 00:00:07,380
 Timing and Subtitles brought by The Spiritual Guardians @ Viki  

2
00:00:09,290 --> 00:00:12,580
Now that we've settled the external conflict,

3
00:00:12,580 --> 00:00:15,410
it's time to discuss our internal conflicts.

4
00:00:15,410 --> 00:00:17,960
So you and I have an internal conflict?

5
00:00:17,960 --> 00:00:21,090
I know your map is with you. Hand it out!

6
00:00:21,090 --> 00:00:23,350
Sure. Then what?

7
00:00:23,350 --> 00:00:26,800
I will go Yulin Street to find Budhi tree. After the Qi Ming of Budhi tree, that Ninja will go blow the tree up.

8
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:29,040
When that person comes to destroy the tree I will capture him.

9
00:00:29,040 --> 00:00:31,650
Through him, I'll get back the spirit tree sprout.

10
00:00:31,650 --> 00:00:34,040
-Then what about me? -Aren't you about to graduate?

11
00:00:34,040 --> 00:00:38,910
It's up to you. You may go overseas to take tests and get certification, like civil servants test, English test band 6, French test band 8.

12
00:00:38,910 --> 00:00:41,790
Or you may find someone to marry, find a godfather. It's up to you.

13
00:00:41,790 --> 00:00:43,970
How about this?

14
00:00:45,410 --> 00:00:49,640
I go Yulin Street and find the Budhi Tree. After the Qi Ming of Budhi Tree, I will find the Ninja who blows the tree up,

15
00:00:49,640 --> 00:00:52,340
and retake Sacred Pagoda branch. How is it?

16
00:00:52,340 --> 00:00:55,730
You can...

17
00:00:55,730 --> 00:01:00,220
Now Little Liang is the requiem general of Rakshasa Street, and you are wanted.

18
00:01:00,220 --> 00:01:03,280
Or continue to deliver your takeouts, how about that?

19
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:05,190
Haha.

20
00:01:11,410 --> 00:01:14,210
Let go. Let go!

21
00:01:14,210 --> 00:01:16,590
Let's eat hotpot at night.

22
00:01:16,590 --> 00:01:19,280
- Let go of your hand!   - Let go!

23
00:01:20,810 --> 00:01:22,720
- These are you roommates?  - Take me with you!

24
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:24,510
- They're all staring.   - Let's go traveling together.

25
00:01:24,510 --> 00:01:26,680
- They'll misunderstand!   - I'll shout that you're raping me!

26
00:01:26,680 --> 00:01:28,080
- Raping you?!   - Someone is raping me!

27
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:30,460
Let's go together...

28
00:01:30,460 --> 00:01:33,000
This person is...?

29
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,080
Old Cao from next door.

30
00:01:40,290 --> 00:01:42,450
Did you go to university?

31
00:01:42,450 --> 00:01:44,750
Nope. But I came here often.

32
00:01:44,750 --> 00:01:46,460
Trying to get a girl?

33
00:01:46,460 --> 00:01:48,890
Delivering take out.

34
00:01:49,670 --> 00:01:53,880
Do you think we can still see Mr. Ghost?

35
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:55,820
We definitely will.

36
00:01:55,820 --> 00:02:01,110
Those lost have lost and those have met will naturally meet each other again.

37
00:02:01,110 --> 00:02:03,700
So when do we go to Yulin street?

38
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:08,380
When the training ends.

39
00:02:08,380 --> 00:02:12,130
I do admit that my current condition is very lacking.

40
00:02:12,130 --> 00:02:13,620
It's here!

41
00:02:13,620 --> 00:02:15,170
What's wrong?

42
00:02:15,810 --> 00:02:18,290
All my stuff and luggage are still in Ghostdom!

43
00:02:18,290 --> 00:02:21,100
That's considered luggage?

44
00:02:24,100 --> 00:02:26,150
Let me tell you, of course that counts!

45
00:02:26,150 --> 00:02:28,680
There's also three underwears!

46
00:03:34,230 --> 00:03:37,800
 Rakshasa Street 

47
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:40,040
 Episode 10 

48
00:03:47,420 --> 00:03:49,850
Things remain, yet people have changed. The past events have faded like a puff of smoke.

49
00:03:49,850 --> 00:03:53,760
Right. It was just yesterday.

50
00:03:54,910 --> 00:03:58,060
Okay, let's start the second stage of training.

51
00:03:58,060 --> 00:04:00,530
I can't wait for it!

52
00:04:04,380 --> 00:04:08,010
Let's go! Training!

53
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:20,000
You came back.

54
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,260
What about Cao Yan Bing?

55
00:04:24,930 --> 00:04:27,060
Did you kill him yet?

56
00:04:29,770 --> 00:04:32,010
Then where is he?

57
00:04:32,010 --> 00:04:36,250
I don't know. I didn't go find Cao Yan Bing.

58
00:04:36,250 --> 00:04:39,080
I went to go find someone that was close to him.

59
00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:40,900
Who is it?

60
00:04:40,900 --> 00:04:47,160
Someone wrote to me, and told me that he might be Huang Fu Long Dou

61
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:49,630
But, he is not, right?

62
00:04:52,100 --> 00:04:54,700
Indeed, he isn't.

63
00:04:54,700 --> 00:04:58,840
You went to look for it, just because you wanted to figure out

64
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:03,360
between you and him, who's the most strongest?

65
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:05,640
I just wanted to see

66
00:05:05,640 --> 00:05:10,420
the distance between me and him that seems very close, how far exactly it is.

67
00:05:11,590 --> 00:05:14,920
Let's cheers because we succeeded in training! Cheers!

68
00:05:19,930 --> 00:05:22,490
When you drink you look like...

69
00:05:22,490 --> 00:05:24,010
Charming.

70
00:05:24,010 --> 00:05:26,160
Like a man.

71
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:34,230
-What is this? -It's for you.

72
00:05:34,230 --> 00:05:37,280
Wow. Fire General. What's up?

73
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:39,470
I noticed that you don't have your general tag anymore.

74
00:05:39,470 --> 00:05:42,190
I didn't want you to feel weird not having anything hanging around your neck anymore.

75
00:05:42,190 --> 00:05:45,040
Hey, but don't reject my good deeds.

76
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:49,250
Because I don't often treat you with good deeds.

77
00:05:53,810 --> 00:05:55,770
Open it and take a look.

78
00:06:02,300 --> 00:06:03,480
What is it?

79
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:06,890
Spirit clothes. General tags can help sense abnormalities

80
00:06:06,890 --> 00:06:11,860
such as human and evil spirits. And spirit clothes can hide

81
00:06:11,860 --> 00:06:15,010
the smell of guardian spirits to keep the general tag from sensing them.

82
00:06:15,010 --> 00:06:16,650
Is it yours?

83
00:06:16,650 --> 00:06:18,580
It's my mom's.

84
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:24,740
Alright, tomorrow night at 12, we'll meet up at entrance

85
00:06:24,740 --> 00:06:25,610
Cheers.

86
00:06:25,610 --> 00:06:27,480
Here.

87
00:06:29,930 --> 00:06:32,340
-This place is not bad, right? -Not bad.

88
00:06:32,340 --> 00:06:34,870
I'll bring you to try some out.

89
00:06:36,620 --> 00:06:38,430
Let's go.

90
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:46,020
Let's go.

91
00:06:50,860 --> 00:06:53,220
This girl is not bad.

92
00:06:57,370 --> 00:06:59,110
Little girl.

93
00:07:05,900 --> 00:07:09,670
Do you just look pretty, or did you have plastic surgery to be pretty?

94
00:07:09,670 --> 00:07:13,700
You sober yet? If so, walk back 10 steps and you'll find the exit.

95
00:07:17,310 --> 00:07:22,070
If I want to be naughty, I don't need to be drunk.

96
00:07:38,210 --> 00:07:40,740
Li Xuan Yuan.

97
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:06,180
Why is it you?

98
00:08:06,180 --> 00:08:08,370
If it's not me, then who else can it be?

99
00:08:08,370 --> 00:08:09,750
Li Xuan Yuan. Li Xuan Yuan!

100
00:08:09,750 --> 00:08:11,290
 Master. 

101
00:08:11,290 --> 00:08:13,460
Hurry up and save me.

102
00:08:13,460 --> 00:08:15,430
 I just fell asleep. 

103
00:08:15,430 --> 00:08:18,910
Your calling out your spirit method is so special.

104
00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:30,210
This is the entrance to Yulin street?

105
00:08:30,210 --> 00:08:32,640
Yes. The map said it so it's right.

106
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:35,470
Why do I feel it's so like Super Mario?

107
00:08:35,470 --> 00:08:38,080
I think it's like Ninja Turtles.

108
00:08:39,090 --> 00:08:40,660
 [ Yulin Street ] 

109
00:09:48,700 --> 00:09:52,500
There's a fish in the north, namely Kun; It became bird, namely Roc.

110
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:54,800
The back of Roc, it's unknowingly as long as thousand miles.

111
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:58,400
It flies with anger, its wings are like clouds all over the sky.

112
00:09:58,400 --> 00:10:02,100
Correct, this is Yulin Street.

113
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:34,400
Why do the people here have such white faces?

114
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:36,600
It's their customs.

115
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:41,900
You're a wanted man, shouldn't you disguise a little bit? It's not good to walk swaggeringly like this, right?

116
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:44,200
That's right.

117
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,900
You're more suspicious like that.

118
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:57,400
This lady, do you know news about the Bodhi Tree?

119
00:10:58,400 --> 00:11:02,800
De.. demon... demon!

120
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:14,200
Miss, I'm sorry but

121
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:16,200
May I ask, do you know news about the Bodhi Tree?

122
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:18,400
Stinky demon!

123
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:28,100
My new bought sunglasses.

124
00:11:28,100 --> 00:11:30,300
What's the situation?

125
00:11:30,300 --> 00:11:31,800
What's wrong?

126
00:11:41,940 --> 00:11:43,520
This, old man.

127
00:11:44,500 --> 00:11:48,200
May I ask, do you know news about the Bodhi Tree?

128
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:50,000
Demon!

129
00:12:05,300 --> 00:12:08,700
This morning, there was someone asking news about the Bodhi Tree.

130
00:12:09,900 --> 00:12:14,700
Are there a man with black sunglasses and a woman who is hundred times uglier than me?

131
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:19,600
They ask for the demon land, perhaps they are no good.

132
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:23,600
- We quickly figure out how to inform General Men.   - Ok.

133
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:28,200
  - Here.       - Demon land... Is something big going to happen in Yulin Street?  

134
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:30,000
It's hard to say.

135
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,800
Let's eat.

136
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:35,400
- Customer, your dishes are here. Please enjoy.   - Oh.

137
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:38,000
If you need anything, you can just call me.

138
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:43,400
Is the Bodhi tree poisonous? Why are they reacting like that?

139
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:45,200
Do you think it's a pronunciation problem?

140
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:49,000
As in the pronunciation of Budhi tree in Yulin street actually is Demon.

141
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:53,200
Since, there all are afraid of the Bodhi Tree then they must know news about the Bodhi Tree.

142
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,600
-Don't even think about it. -What?

143
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:03,600
You are a wanted man already.

144
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:07,200
So you can't go further and further on the road of crime.

145
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:09,000
Stupid girl.

146
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:26,100
Bodhi Tree, Bodhi Tree! Does anyone know news about the Bodhi Tree?!

147
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:29,900
Hurry and go!

148
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:33,000
Really?

149
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:36,000
You idiot, they've all ran. Who are you going to get information from now?

150
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,700
There is still one.

151
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:45,400
After the Ebb Tide, the one who stayed is the real gold.

152
00:13:47,290 --> 00:13:48,960
Why didn't you run?

153
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,600
Why do I need to run?

154
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:53,800
Then why did they run?

155
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:58,280
It's because you scared them.

156
00:13:59,300 --> 00:14:02,600
Who are you? What's different about you and them?

157
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:04,280
Let me introduce myself.

158
00:14:04,280 --> 00:14:08,600
Normally you may find people like me in every tavern in requiem streets.

159
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:11,400
We are called big nose, rich in information.

160
00:14:11,400 --> 00:14:14,900
Ask me one question, one Daoqi.

161
00:14:17,300 --> 00:14:19,000
Where did that come from?

162
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,800
Something I save from last night.

163
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:26,400
If you're asking me about the Bodhi Tree, then forget about it.

164
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:29,100
This question, I'm not selling it.

165
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:33,600
Xiao Baozi! Xiao Baozi!

166
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:36,400
Who scared all my customers away?

167
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:41,000
Leave.

168
00:14:56,200 --> 00:14:57,700
Where is the Bodhi Tree?

169
00:14:57,700 --> 00:15:01,400
Bodhi tree is inside the Ming Jing village. Ming Jing village is a forbidden place in Yulin Street.

170
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:03,800
There's a stonehenge at the entrance.

171
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:07,400
Ming Jing village is called as demon land, it's full of demons inside.

172
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:10,000
Five years ago, the demon came out to hurt people.

173
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,200
Yulin Street was in a huge lost.

174
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:18,600
So, everything about Ming Jing village is forbidden.

175
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:33,200
Let me ask a question.

176
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:34,600
Go ahead.

177
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:37,000
Is there a ghost in requiem streets?

178
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:40,600
Of course, there is none. How would ghost be an organism?

179
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:44,500
But there is Big Roc, isn't Big Roc the bird that only appears in the mythical story?

180
00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:48,500
Maybe there was human accidentally entered Ghostdom in the past and saw the Big Roc,

181
00:15:48,500 --> 00:15:51,600
and was rumored outside, then remembered by someone.

182
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:55,000
Aren't there many spirit beasts being written into mythical stories by human?

183
00:15:55,800 --> 00:16:00,000
So they are organisms. Organisms are not ghosts.

184
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:05,800
Then why the people in Yulin Street keep saying demon?

185
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:08,400
The civilization degree here is like our Qin Han dynasty.

186
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:12,200
To use demons to describe things they don't understand is normal.

187
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:15,200
- Hit!   - Hit!

188
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:18,000
Little children, what are you guys doing?

189
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,200
Stop it.

190
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:20,600
What are you guys doing?

191
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:22,400
Why does it matter?

192
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:24,700
What are you looking at?!

193
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:38,200
Do you know who my father is? My father is—

194
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:42,600
- Help!   - Haha!

195
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:48,000
Cao Yan Bing, they are only children.

196
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,600
But they are mean little children.

197
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:52,800
They are still children.

198
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:54,800
Is your lady heart deluging?

199
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:57,000
No compassion.

200
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:03,100
What about the little girl? Where did she run off to?

201
00:17:03,100 --> 00:17:05,000
How would I know.

202
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:07,900
Look over there.

203
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:10,400
What?

204
00:17:24,200 --> 00:17:25,800
What is this place?

205
00:17:25,800 --> 00:17:27,900
Paradise.

206
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:49,600
Bai Shi Men...

207
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,200
Bai Shi Men...

208
00:18:01,800 --> 00:18:03,100
Bai...

209
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,000
 He is the requiem general of Yulin Street. 

210
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:18,300
 It's said that he is a man who makes people fear him. 

211
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:24,400
 Hey, hey, hey, hey. 

212
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:27,800
 Cao Yan Bing has already arrived Ming Jing village. 

213
00:18:27,800 --> 00:18:29,600
 Sorry, let me pass. 

214
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:31,000
 Cao Yan Bing, you came back! 

215
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,000
 Your man works now? 

216
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:37,200
 When the southest bright star during the autumn night, 

217
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:40,300
 the dimming of Bei Luo Shi Men, 

218
00:18:40,300 --> 00:18:43,000
 the Bodhi tree will produce the Supreme Fruit. 

219
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:46,300
  We are really scary demons who eat humans! Rawr! 

220
00:18:47,500 --> 00:18:50,000
-My father is... -Stop. Ok, change.

221
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:53,400
 [ The quick and neat staff ] 

222
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:56,100
Fun or not? You can't move.

223
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,400
Ok, don't move, don't move.

224
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:01,800
3, 2, 1.

225
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:04,000
You say, that "My father is..."

226
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:07,700
3, 2, 1. Start.

227
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:09,600
Cao Yan Bing.

228
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:10,800
Haha.    [ Magical laughter ] 

229
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:14,000
Good?

230
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:17,000
Again.

231
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:18,820
Haha.    [ The familiar laughter ] 

232
00:19:18,820 --> 00:19:21,390
Record until here. Let's watch the replay.

233
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,400
Haha.    [ Already in his later stage ] 

234
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:24,200
Return back.

235
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:26,600
Cao Yan Bing, they are little children.

236
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:28,800
But they are mean little children.

237
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:30,400
They are still children.

238
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:32,900
Okay, cut!

239
00:19:32,900 --> 00:19:36,600
