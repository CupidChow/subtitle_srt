2
00:00:07,080 --> 00:00:08,450
- Elder is here.   - Jing Yin

3
00:00:08,450 --> 00:00:10,460
What, Jing Xuan is missing?

4
00:00:10,460 --> 00:00:12,630
That's right, we already looked around the village.

5
00:00:12,630 --> 00:00:14,030
But I didn't see my brother.

6
00:00:14,030 --> 00:00:15,210
- That's right.   - That's right.

7
00:00:15,210 --> 00:00:17,810
We already looked around. Where did Jing Xuan go?

8
00:00:17,810 --> 00:00:21,000
You said the last time you saw your brother was at the village entrance?

9
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:26,710
Yes, my brother said that he wanted to play one last song for Mr. Nan as his farewell.

10
00:00:26,710 --> 00:00:28,580
Can it be...

11
00:01:34,630 --> 00:01:38,270
[Rakshasa Street]

12
00:01:38,270 --> 00:01:40,380
- Episode 17 -

13
00:01:44,900 --> 00:01:51,290
It's here. Can it be that he ran out with Mr. Nan?

14
00:01:52,350 --> 00:01:56,780
But Mr. Nan has no memory, he won't remember him.

15
00:02:05,250 --> 00:02:07,950
This...

16
00:02:12,670 --> 00:02:14,470
This...

17
00:02:18,630 --> 00:02:20,480
Jing Xuan?

18
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:32,380
Brother!

19
00:03:00,690 --> 00:03:10,300
Timing and Subtitles brought to you by The Spiritual Guardians @ Viki

20
00:03:35,220 --> 00:03:40,310
I want mom! I want mom!

21
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:18,690
This thing is really sacred.

22
00:04:18,690 --> 00:04:20,450
You...

23
00:04:24,030 --> 00:04:26,290
You liar!

24
00:04:34,990 --> 00:04:39,700
Who knew, you were this kind of person.

25
00:04:40,890 --> 00:04:44,770
No Mingjing platform (mirror stand), would Elder see wrongly, too?

26
00:04:44,770 --> 00:04:48,010
Why would the Bodhi tree choose

27
00:04:48,010 --> 00:04:51,830
a person like you to live?

28
00:04:54,680 --> 00:05:00,760
Bodhi is fundamentally without any tree, the bright mirror is also not a stand.

29
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:08,260
Fundamentally there is not a single thing, where could any dust be attracted?

30
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:13,430
Haven't you heard of it?

31
00:05:15,790 --> 00:05:19,610
This is 300 years after your ancestor's instruction,

32
00:05:19,610 --> 00:05:25,710
the four verses of Sixth Patriarch Huineng. What's the world now?

33
00:05:25,710 --> 00:05:31,340
It's beyond the imagination of the extremely conservative people like you guys.

34
00:05:34,580 --> 00:05:40,870
You all didn't even know that the peach blossom land (Mingjing Village) had already been swallowed by Ghostdom.

35
00:05:40,870 --> 00:05:44,970
I don't know what you're talking about. All your motives are the same.

36
00:05:44,970 --> 00:05:48,660
They're all because of the Bodhi tree!

37
00:05:52,610 --> 00:05:56,370
A man's wealth is his own ruin by causing other's greed.

38
00:05:56,370 --> 00:05:59,890
Too bad, this time, you're wrong.

39
00:06:00,610 --> 00:06:04,650
I want the Bodhi tree.

40
00:06:04,650 --> 00:06:10,100
But what I want more are you guys!

41
00:06:11,310 --> 00:06:16,870
The key to connecting Ghostdom and the human world,  I hope to get it from you guys.

42
00:06:16,870 --> 00:06:21,910
After all, getting all these spirit hosts at once isn't easy to do.

43
00:06:27,100 --> 00:06:30,120
For this highest and noblest job,

44
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:34,840
I'm sorry to have troubled you to suffer a little bit.

45
00:06:34,840 --> 00:06:39,450
It turns out that everything was fake.

46
00:06:40,970 --> 00:06:44,190
Water flows from alpine is fake.

47
00:06:45,150 --> 00:06:49,140
Not wanting to forget me is also fake.

48
00:06:49,140 --> 00:06:52,340
He can read people's minds.

49
00:06:52,340 --> 00:06:57,590
So, he used me.

50
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:20,630
There are thousands of spirit shapes, but the genes are the same.

51
00:07:20,630 --> 00:07:24,360
Once you have an unusual transformation, you can't change back.

52
00:07:25,050 --> 00:07:32,160
But a spirit host is different. A spirit host can control the transformation, and can also be partially transformed.

53
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:36,410
This time, I picked up something valuable.

54
00:07:42,700 --> 00:07:45,290
I can give you the ability to be invisible

55
00:07:45,290 --> 00:07:49,910
so you can wander freely in this world.

56
00:07:53,190 --> 00:07:57,220
Don't give me that desperate look.

57
00:07:57,220 --> 00:08:01,300
The good scenes just started.

58
00:08:12,780 --> 00:08:16,310
He didn't just torture everyone,

59
00:08:16,310 --> 00:08:20,020
He injected various poisons

60
00:08:20,020 --> 00:08:25,560
to cause unusual transformation in everyone.

61
00:08:27,730 --> 00:08:34,960
Then he took advantage of the Bodhi tree's effectiveness to restore everyone's former condition.

62
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:42,830
The cycle continued until he got what he wanted.

63
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:54,440
But Nan Yu Fu never laid his hands on me.

64
00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:09,700
Why are you so depressed like this?

65
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:18,600
There's a ninjutsu in Dongying which is generated from the eyes.

66
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:21,600
It's called the pupil method.

67
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:26,200
To start the pupil method, the eyes must go through the unusual transformation to have a result.

68
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:30,900
Then I'll dig out the eye and transfer it to my face.

69
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:34,000
What do you think about it?

70
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,100
You are a crazy person!

71
00:09:35,100 --> 00:09:39,100
What ever you say. A crazy person changing the world,

72
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,800
and you bugs,

73
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:46,100
deserve to be reduced to raw materials.

74
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:51,500
There will be consequences for this!

75
00:09:57,200 --> 00:10:00,800
For however much sunlight there is, there is just as much darkness.

76
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:04,400
How much brightness there is, there is also as much haze.

77
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:07,400
I told you so many good things in the outside world,

78
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:11,000
there are just as many unbearable things I haven't told you.

79
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:16,200
You're the most horrifying person I've ever seen.

80
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:20,200
That's because the people you met are too little.

81
00:10:22,140 --> 00:10:24,880
From the sounds of your zither,

82
00:10:24,900 --> 00:10:28,200
I can easily hear the running water coming out of the high mountains.

83
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:30,400
But even if you spend your whole life,

84
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:34,400
you will never understand even a little portion of my mind.

85
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:43,200
I'll be lenient towards you.

86
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:45,800
Because if not for you,

87
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:51,500
- I can't get "Ming-Jing-Village."   - You--

88
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:54,900
Later, I knew,

89
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,400
Nan Yu Fu...

90
00:10:58,400 --> 00:11:03,200
hoped the spirit host's body could...

91
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:06,200
produce a drug to let...

92
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:09,800
the humans survive in Ghostdom.

93
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:13,200
He captured humans from the human world.

94
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:15,210
With this medicine,

95
00:11:15,210 --> 00:11:19,000
humans could survive in Ghostdom.

96
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:22,400
And from the bodies of the humans,

97
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:25,200
he searched for a way

98
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:29,000
to let the spirits move freely in the human world.

99
00:11:29,900 --> 00:11:33,300
The Bodhi tree is truly fascinating.

100
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:37,800
The Bodhi tree's roots absorb the poison.

101
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:40,000
Then it transfers the poison to the treetop.

102
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,800
The treetop distributes and dissolves the poison.

103
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:46,600
Afterwards, it becomes a useful substance for the tree.

104
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:52,600
Just like the saprovores in nature.

105
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:55,900
In this way, he could connect

106
00:11:55,900 --> 00:11:59,600
the two worlds of humans and spirits,

107
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:02,800
to achieve his bigger evil scheme.

108
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:05,600
And then the spirits of Yulin Street still

109
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:10,000
had someone enter Mingjing Village to look for treatment.

110
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,000
All these people,

111
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:16,800
were all caught by Nan Yu Fu.

112
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:20,100
You... what are you going to do with us?

113
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:25,800
Unusual transformation is the cancer of spirits.

114
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:27,000
What?!

115
00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:31,000
Unusual transformation is to open up your body

116
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:34,600
and give you stronger power!

117
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:38,000
After that, combine with Ghostdom.

118
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:42,000
When the time comes, the pain,

119
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,800
anger and sorrow

120
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:48,600
will be all factors that can trigger unusual transformation of spirits.

121
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:52,600
The Bodhi tree absorbs 1600 years of resentment;

122
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:55,500
undoubtedly, it's the strongest unusual transformation agent.

123
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:03,270
I'll give its name as "Mad Blood."

124
00:13:03,270 --> 00:13:05,800
Let the madness

125
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:09,400
flow crazily in your blood!

126
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,400
Send him back to Yulin Street.

127
00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:49,400
Why?

128
00:13:49,400 --> 00:13:52,000
I want to let all the people in Yulin Street to know that

129
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,700
whoever enters Minjing Village,

130
00:13:55,550 --> 00:13:57,990
will turn into an unusual being.

131
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:03,600
This place is no longer the mysterious place of celestial beings.

132
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:07,600
But a demon world!

133
00:14:13,700 --> 00:14:19,500
Smart. Like this, no one will bother us.

134
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:23,400
What if this leads a requiem general here?

135
00:14:23,400 --> 00:14:25,700
Requiem general... ?

136
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:29,600
What is he considered?

137
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:36,800
This is the truth about the situation.

138
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:42,200
This... is Mingjing Village's

139
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:45,000
tragedy...

140
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:49,000
Then, how did you guys escape?

141
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,100
Later,

142
00:15:37,070 --> 00:15:38,530
Be good.

143
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:46,400
The Mad Blood agent, I've gotten it.

144
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:50,500
Now, it's the second thing.

145
00:15:51,420 --> 00:15:57,030
I want The-Supreme-Fruit.

146
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,100
You look very surprised.

147
00:16:01,100 --> 00:16:03,800
How would I know about the Supreme Fruit?

148
00:16:03,800 --> 00:16:07,000
I not only know about the Supreme Fruit,

149
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:12,200
I also know that the ancestor's instruction that all of you always talked about.

150
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:15,600
It was established in year 386 AD.

151
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:18,800
That was also 1630 years ago,

152
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:20,400
when your ancestors Bai's household

153
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:24,400
was avoiding the war during the Qin dynasty and ran into this mysterious place.

154
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:27,600
Thinking about it, it's very ironic.

155
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:29,800
The descendants of Killing God Bai Qi,

156
00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:33,400
are actually healing people here.

157
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:38,000
Perhaps it was because it was too much sin of killing, so doing this is to clear up the sin.

158
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:42,200
1630 years ago, there was a fisherman

159
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:45,400
who accidentally entered Mingjing Village.

160
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:50,000
Your ancestors treated him with good hospitality and also warned him,

161
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:55,100
"Don't tell anything inside to anyone outside."

162
00:16:59,800 --> 00:17:04,000
This fisherman lingered here for a few days

163
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:09,000
but he did a very flaky thing.

164
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:13,900
It was that he took the Bai's family's eldest daughter,

165
00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:20,000
It was said that the two people were also in love.

166
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,600
But Bai's family's eldest daughter towards to world...

167
00:17:22,600 --> 00:17:25,200
was curious.

168
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:28,400
And this fisherman couldn't stay here for long.

169
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:32,800
So Bai's family's eldest daughter left Mingjing Village.

170
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:35,200
And then they got married and had children.

171
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:39,200
The bloodline of Bai's household was continued outside.

172
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:43,600
That time your ancestors established ancestor's instructions,

173
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:49,000
hoping to avoid this kind of thing to happen again.

174
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:53,800
And that fisherman had a friend who was a poet,

175
00:17:53,800 --> 00:17:58,400
the people in the world called him Mr. Jing Jie.

176
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:02,900
He wrote the fisherman's experience into an essay,

177
00:18:02,900 --> 00:18:04,790
and it was remembered throughout the ages.

178
00:18:04,790 --> 00:18:08,900
It was named as "A Tale of Peach Blossom Land."

179
00:18:10,700 --> 00:18:15,800
I want to thank this Mr. Jing Jie. If not because of him,

180
00:18:15,800 --> 00:18:19,600
I also didn't know where you guys were.

181
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:25,500
Counting the days, the young fruit of Supreme Fruit

182
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:28,800
will be produced today!

183
00:18:52,800 --> 00:18:55,800
Hurry. Hurry. Follow me.

184
00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:03,400
Elder, what's that?

185
00:19:13,800 --> 00:19:15,200
Hurry and go.

186
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:40,800
Mingjing Village encountered this great change.

187
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:45,400
We... we have failed our ancestors.

188
00:19:49,650 --> 00:19:52,740
It's all my fault.

189
00:19:56,200 --> 00:19:58,800
I saved a viper,

190
00:19:58,800 --> 00:20:01,600
but the viper bit me.

191
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:04,000
Is it me who's at fault?

192
00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:41,200
- Use our blood...   - Use our blood...

193
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:46,400
-...to tell today's injustice.   -...to tell today's injustice.

194
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:49,800
- Use the name of our tribe...   - Use the name of our tribe...

195
00:20:49,800 --> 00:20:56,000
-...to wait for the return of the lord of Bai's tribe.   -...to wait for the return of the lord of Bai's tribe.

196
00:20:57,800 --> 00:20:59,600
Elder!

197
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:03,800
Elder, too bad. They are coming after us.

198
00:21:03,800 --> 00:21:07,400
The Bodhi tree is now in their hands.

199
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:11,200
This is our last hiding place.

200
00:21:13,800 --> 00:21:15,600
Everyone come with me and charge!

201
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:18,300
But they are Spirit Armor Army!

202
00:21:19,800 --> 00:21:21,000
We...

203
00:21:23,100 --> 00:21:28,200
Take... those things... over here.

204
00:21:38,130 --> 00:21:40,980
Pass it out to everyone.

205
00:21:42,580 --> 00:21:44,470
No matter what,

206
00:21:44,500 --> 00:21:49,000
you are the last person in Mingjing's Village who's normal.

207
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,500
Protect well the ancestor's instruction.

208
00:21:52,800 --> 00:21:56,200
Find the owner of the Bai family...

209
00:21:56,200 --> 00:22:00,000
to inherit the ancestor's instruction.

210
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:25,000
Go!

211
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:41,800
Like this,

212
00:22:42,800 --> 00:22:45,400
we raided the Spirit Armor Army,

213
00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:48,200
and stayed there.

214
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:51,200
But because of the Mad Blood,

215
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:53,600
everyone couldn't talk.

216
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:56,200
We don't dare to act rashly.

217
00:22:56,200 --> 00:22:59,000
We are scared of being discovered by Nan Yu Fu.

218
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:02,900
And that time the requiem general of Yulin Street

219
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:08,000
wanted to investigate about the unusual transformation of spirits, so he

220
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,500
entered Mingjing Village.

221
00:23:12,800 --> 00:23:15,200
Was he killed by Nan Yu Fu?

222
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:19,600
Yes. The accusation of Demon Land

223
00:23:20,620 --> 00:23:24,000
was made even more real by them.

224
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:27,200
And the succeeding requiem general

225
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:31,300
is Bei Luo Shi Men.

226
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:35,280
Bei Luo Shi Men...

227
00:23:39,350 --> 00:23:43,620
So you led me and Xia Ling to go look for Elder,

228
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:47,200
was to use that chance to give me the ancestor's instruction.

229
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:49,500
The so-called ancestor's instruction,

230
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:55,200
is actually a special psychic letter.

231
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:59,600
It contains the power of Bai's household.

232
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:02,300
Only the descendant of Bai's household

233
00:24:02,300 --> 00:24:04,600
can see it.

234
00:24:07,800 --> 00:24:13,000
Nan Yu Fu thought us as an insignificant people,

235
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:15,800
he didn't kill us all ruthlessly.

236
00:24:15,800 --> 00:24:18,600
But as long as we appear,

237
00:24:18,600 --> 00:24:20,200
it will definitely lead us

238
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:23,500
to the fate of extermination of our entire family.

239
00:24:24,300 --> 00:24:28,200
We entrust our ancestor's instruction to you.

240
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:31,400
We hope you can defeat Nan Yu Fu

241
00:24:31,400 --> 00:24:33,800
and find the descendant of Bai's household

242
00:24:33,800 --> 00:24:36,800
to rebuild Mingjing

243
00:24:36,800 --> 00:24:38,000
Village...

244
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:47,100
Why is it me?

245
00:24:47,800 --> 00:24:51,400
After we only went outside from the village,

246
00:24:51,400 --> 00:24:55,400
then we knew on this world,

247
00:24:55,400 --> 00:25:00,200
there was a Ghostdom, human world. Mingjing Village

248
00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:03,600
was originally the intersection of

249
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:07,400
Ghostdom and the human world. After that,

250
00:25:07,400 --> 00:25:10,000
Ghostdom expanded

251
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:13,000
and swallowed Mingjing Village.

252
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:15,600
The bloodline of Bai's household

253
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:17,800
is actually flowing

254
00:25:17,800 --> 00:25:20,600
in the human world.

255
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:26,800
Because I'm a spirit host, I can go to and fro between two worlds.

256
00:25:26,800 --> 00:25:29,100
What is more important is,

257
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:32,800
over these 5 years, you are

258
00:25:32,800 --> 00:25:36,800
the only person that is looking for the Bodhi tree.

259
00:25:36,800 --> 00:25:40,900
Only you are not afraid of Nan Yu Fu.

260
00:25:42,140 --> 00:25:45,800
They already destroyed Ling Huai.

261
00:25:47,400 --> 00:25:51,600
Promise me, don't let them

262
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:56,600
destory our Bodhi yree, too.

263
00:26:02,630 --> 00:26:06,490
Promise... me...

264
00:26:32,910 --> 00:26:36,810
The descendant of Bai's household, I will slowly find him.

265
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:40,600
As for Nan Yu Fu...

266
00:26:43,400 --> 00:26:45,500
Let's not wait anymore.

267
00:27:20,500 --> 00:27:23,900
