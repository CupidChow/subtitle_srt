By the way, can the person outside not eat?

138
00:20:53,480 --> 00:20:56,980
Your skin can actually scatter the reflected light until it becomes invisible.

00:21:01,230 --> 00:21:04,530
Have you watched X-Men? He is like a mutant.

142
00:21:04,530 --> 00:21:08,960
The series of killing action you encountered in human world, are done by them.

143
00:21:14,790 --> 00:21:16,740
Why is he harming me?

144
00:21:16,740 --> 00:21:18,580
Ask him.

145
00:21:20,330 --> 00:21:22,320
Why are you harming me?

146
00:21:27,370 --> 00:21:28,600
Why isn't he talking?

147
00:21:28,600 --> 00:21:32,930
Because he can't talk. Probably, when he was young, his tongue got cut off.

148
00:21:32,930 --> 00:21:37,050
Since childhood, he's been stealing and assassinating. He's afraid of leaking secrets when he's captured.

149
00:21:37,050 --> 00:21:38,900
What are you doing?! Are you going to kill him?

150
00:21:38,900 --> 00:21:40,490
What are you doing? Are you going to let him go?

151
00:21:40,490 --> 00:21:43,360
How can you hurt an unarmed man?

152
00:21:44,190 --> 00:21:45,620
That's right.

153
00:21:47,310 --> 00:21:48,620

00:21:48,620 --> 00:21:50,470
What? He has a weapon in his hand now.

155
00:21:50,470 --> 00:21:52,760
Are you crazy?

156
00:21:52,760 --> 00:21:54,840
No one on Rakshasa street cares?

157
00:21:54,840 --> 00:21:56,090
- Who is it?   Me.

158
00:21:56,090 --> 00:21:57,930
You?

159
00:21:57,930 --> 00:22:02,450
Sister Xia Ling. What brother said is true. He's the requiem general of Rakshasa street.

160
00:22:02,450 --> 00:22:06,460
Isn't he some kind of spirit host? How can he be a requiem general?

161
00:22:06,460 --> 00:22:08,990
It's a bit similar to the relationship between equation and equality.

162
00:22:08,990 --> 00:22:13,720
It means the equation must have equality, but the equality may not be an equation.

163
00:22:13,720 --> 00:22:17,690
So you mean, spirit host must be requiem general, but requiem general may not be spirit host.

164
00:22:17,690 --> 00:22:19,090
Is your math taught by physical education teacher?

165
00:22:19,090 --> 00:22:20,880
What does this have to do with physical education teacher?

166
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:25,340
Forget it, this is not important. I need to perform official duties, back to business.

167
00:22:26,210 --> 00:22:28,100
I... what are you doing?

168
00:22:28,100 --> 00:22:29,670
You can't casually hurt other people.

169
00:22:29,670 --> 00:22:31,670
I'm performing official duties!

170
00:22:31,670 --> 00:22:36,150
I tell you, this Rakshasa street is my turf!

00:22:55,030 --> 00:22:58,120
Let me tell you, the person he wanted to hurt was you, not me.

175
00:22:58,120 --> 00:23:02,190
So do you want to release like this and let him go to kill you again? By then, there is no more person like you who stands before him like this.

176
00:23:02,190 --> 00:23:03,530
Then, that's my issue.

177
00:23:03,530 --> 00:23:07,670
Also, I already found a way to protect myself.

178
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:44,730
Let me tell you, you'll regret letting him go.

179
00:23:44,730 --> 00:23:46,600
Then, that's my issue.

180
00:23:46,600 --> 00:23:50,340
But can you guys tell me, what's going on?

181
00:23:50,340 --> 00:23:52,360
Then, you have to tell me first, how you found this place.

182
00:23:52,360 --> 00:23:57,080
Previously, I received a video mail. A person who called Gui... Gui something Tong.

183
00:23:57,080 --> 00:24:00,740
That email told me to come to this address. It said you you can save me.

184
00:24:00,740 --> 00:24:04,140
- Guifu Santong?   - Yes. Do you know him?

185
00:24:07,380 --> 00:24:09,340
I don't know him.

186
00:24:09,340 --> 00:24:12,920
But I heard he spread words to our spirit host

187
00:24:12,920 --> 00:24:16,390
asking us to be aware of an extremist group called kingdom. Some says he is a very strong spirit host,

188
00:24:16,390 --> 00:24:19,650
but also some says he is just a clown who spreads rumors.

189
00:24:19,650 --> 00:24:23,810
But again, how did you see that letter?

190
00:24:25,100 --> 00:24:27,430
With my eyes.

191
00:24:31,180 --> 00:24:35,420
Can both of you brothers stop exchanging glances?

192
00:24:35,420 --> 00:24:39,330
She can see the words on the spirit letter. The minimum rank is black rope level or higher.

193
00:24:39,330 --> 00:24:41,980
Able to live in Rakshasa street until now.

194
00:24:41,980 --> 00:24:45,670
It seems the spirit host isn't strange.

195
00:24:45,670 --> 00:24:47,210
Say it.

196
00:24:47,980 --> 00:24:50,820
Afterall, what is a spirit host?

197
00:24:50,820 --> 00:24:53,220
What is a requiem general?

198
00:24:57,080 --> 00:24:58,560
Say it.

199
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:01,130
What place is this?

200
00:25:01,130 --> 00:25:03,780
This is another world.

201
00:25:05,710 --> 00:25:07,430
Can it be,

202
00:25:11,590 --> 00:25:13,530
that I died?

203
00:25:26,380 --> 00:25:28,960
General, I came.

204
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:30,890
Say it.

205
00:25:30,890 --> 00:25:34,060
That Cao Yan Bing is too valiant.

206
00:25:34,060 --> 00:25:38,790
General Fu Cai and General Fu Guan are both killed by him.

207
00:25:39,980 --> 00:25:45,800
What? How can that be?

208
00:25:45,800 --> 00:25:49,060
Cao Yan Bing.

209
00:25:49,060 --> 00:25:52,770
Cao Yan Bing.

210
00:25:52,770 --> 00:25:57,590
It's unmistakable. He must be the later generation of Wei Wu.

211
00:25:57,590 --> 00:26:01,620
General. If Cao Yan Bing is truly the later generation of Wu Wei,

212
00:26:01,620 --> 00:26:05,510
Even if we are pulling back now, perhaps he won't let us off.

213
00:26:05,510 --> 00:26:10,340
We lost 2 times in a row today. If we let that person knows,

214
00:26:10,340 --> 00:26:15,470
no matter what, we can't let that person knows.

215
00:26:15,470 --> 00:26:19,680
The person you guys were talking about, is that me?

216
00:26:55,290 --> 00:26:59,440
Mankind has no way of entering this world.

217
00:27:00,710 --> 00:27:05,800
You can enter. That means you are a spirit host.

218
00:27:07,700 --> 00:27:11,240
As for what is a spirit host. To explain the literal meaning,

219
00:27:11,240 --> 00:27:14,730
a spirit resides in your body.

220
00:27:16,840 --> 00:27:18,570
A spirit?

221
00:27:18,570 --> 00:27:21,960
In common language,

222
00:27:21,960 --> 00:27:25,090
A ghost entered your body.

223
00:27:26,670 --> 00:27:27,850
Ghost entered my body?

224
00:27:27,850 --> 00:27:32,380
That's right. Your body has a ghost living there.

225
00:27:32,380 --> 00:27:35,480
Letting your parts be parts of another world.

226
00:27:35,480 --> 00:27:38,140
That ghost will be like a passport.

227
00:27:38,140 --> 00:27:41,600
can let you come to this world. Think about it yourself.

228
00:27:43,930 --> 00:27:46,430
Have you seen that ghost?

229
00:27:46,430 --> 00:27:50,450
For example, when you're in danger,

230
00:27:54,320 --> 00:27:57,720
you've seen a ghost! You've seen a ghost! You've seen that kind of ghost.

231
00:27:57,720 --> 00:28:01,450
That kind of ghost likes to make a contract with a person. They're like a parasite in your body.

232
00:28:01,450 --> 00:28:04,650
- Wait until the timing is ripe, he will... - What?

233
00:28:04,650 --> 00:28:07,530
- He will... - What?!

234
00:28:07,530 --> 00:28:12,340
He will slowly devour your internal organs and eat very neatly and slowly.

235
00:28:12,340 --> 00:28:15,840
And make you a part of this world.

236
00:28:17,460 --> 00:28:20,320
Amitabha.

237
00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:22,660
I'm still young.

238
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:27,090
Alright, alright. Brother, don't scare sister.

239
00:28:27,090 --> 00:28:30,290
Sister, you're living well. The other world, brother mentioned,

240
00:28:30,290 --> 00:28:33,980
you just understand it as the other space or a mysterious place.

241
00:28:33,980 --> 00:28:36,310
What is the other space?

242
00:28:36,310 --> 00:28:39,690
It's like those in the movies, whatever alien planet, parallel world,

243
00:28:39,690 --> 00:28:42,650
underground world that kind of other space. It's not hell.

244
00:28:42,650 --> 00:28:46,080
And guardian spirit is also not a ghost that lives inside your body.

245
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:48,430
Guardian spirit is also a living being.

246
00:28:48,430 --> 00:28:52,260
It's just their life forms are a bit different from us.

247
00:28:52,260 --> 00:28:55,760
I can't understand. Does it me that I'm still alive?

248
00:28:55,760 --> 00:28:58,660
Playing lute to a cow.

249
00:28:58,660 --> 00:29:01,920
Brother, don't talk that much.

250
00:29:05,860 --> 00:29:09,190
The world we are at is called Ghostdom.

251
00:29:09,190 --> 00:29:13,780
You look at this, the circle in the center is the central of Ghostdom.

252
00:29:13,780 --> 00:29:16,180
There live constables who rule the Ghostdom.

253
00:29:16,180 --> 00:29:19,820
And those countless streets around it are collectively called requiem streets.

254
00:29:19,820 --> 00:29:23,060
The street we are at is called Rakshasa street.

255
00:29:23,060 --> 00:29:28,320
Constables will appoint spirit hosts to safeguard requiem streets, they are called requiem general.

256
00:29:28,320 --> 00:29:31,940
My older brother is the requiem general of Rakshasa street.

257
00:29:41,260 --> 00:29:45,430
Rakshasa street is right here. Yesterday you came in from here.

258
00:29:45,430 --> 00:29:50,040
This entrance is the intersection of Ghostdom and Human world, it's called door.

259
00:29:50,040 --> 00:29:53,560
The air, water, soil in the Ghostdom are totally different from Human world.

260
00:29:53,560 --> 00:29:57,730
So, if a normal living creature accidentally enters, it will die of poison.

261
00:29:57,730 --> 00:30:02,200
Die of poison? Then, am I poisoned right now?

262
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:05,060
You won't, because you are a spirit host.

263
00:30:05,060 --> 00:30:08,150
In your body lives a guardian spirit who is protecting you.

264
00:30:08,150 --> 00:30:10,880
So, you can go back and forth in both spirit and human worlds.

265
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:14,450
In certain words, you belong to Human world and also belong to Ghostdom.

266
00:30:14,450 --> 00:30:16,570
I still don't understand.

267
00:30:16,570 --> 00:30:21,540
Anyway little Liang, you just tell me if I'm still alive now, and I won't die in short term.

268
00:30:21,540 --> 00:30:24,220
You won't. And you have a guardian spirit,

269
00:30:24,220 --> 00:30:27,230
so you will be even healthier than normal human beings.

270
00:30:28,040 --> 00:30:30,560
But she's stupider than normal people.

271
00:30:36,850 --> 00:30:40,160
Hello? Yes, I'll come immediately.

272
00:30:40,160 --> 00:30:43,920
Ok, I don't talk anymore. Xuan Liang, take care of her well.

273
00:30:44,470 --> 00:30:46,700
Alright, brother.

274
00:30:46,700 --> 00:30:49,850
Where are you going? Hey, Cao Yan Bing, where are you going?

275
00:30:49,850 --> 00:30:52,870
Sister, don't shout anymore. He's doing all that because of you.

276
00:30:52,870 --> 00:30:56,600
Because of me? Isn't he delivering take out?

277
00:30:56,600 --> 00:31:00,340
Pork strips stir fried plus Kung Pao chicken. It's a total of 25.8 mao

278
00:31:00,340 --> 00:31:04,780
He's not only delivering take out. After delivering, he will go destroy the nest of General Fu Shi.

279
00:31:04,780 --> 00:31:07,430
In this way, there's no more evil spirit threatening your life anymore.

280
00:31:07,430 --> 00:31:10,760
Wait a second. You keep saying a word.

281
00:31:10,760 --> 00:31:13,340
What does evil spirit mean?

282
00:31:19,380 --> 00:31:23,760
Ji Ling, you were a brave warrior before.

283
00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:26,380
You stayed in Ghostdom for over 2000 years,

284
00:31:26,380 --> 00:31:29,850
but you evolved into such a weak evil spirit.

285
00:31:29,850 --> 00:31:32,280
Why?

286
00:31:32,280 --> 00:31:36,100
We had an agreement before.

287
00:31:37,110 --> 00:31:42,450
Although we don't know why Cao Yan Bing's general pendant would ring,

288
00:31:42,450 --> 00:31:45,570
since the thing has happened.

289
00:31:45,570 --> 00:31:50,300
There must be someone for a back up, killing them.

290
00:31:50,300 --> 00:31:55,450
Such a simple reason and you need me to explain?

291
00:31:56,350 --> 00:31:58,530
Who knew

292
00:31:58,530 --> 00:32:02,790
that you would be such scared of Cao Yan Bing?

293
00:32:04,490 --> 00:32:06,730
Your brain,

294
00:32:06,730 --> 00:32:11,830
no wonder your IQ setting in the game of Three Kingdoms is only less than 20.

295
00:32:11,830 --> 00:32:15,190
The people who are afraid of Cao Yan Bing, is you.

296
00:32:17,030 --> 00:32:19,650
Not me.

297
00:32:19,650 --> 00:32:23,720
You are afraid of him because he has the blood of Wei Wu,

298
00:32:23,720 --> 00:32:27,690
bearing the fighting spirit of Cao Wei. I know that

299
00:32:27,690 --> 00:32:31,220
the stamp of betrayal on your subordinates' faces,

300
00:32:31,220 --> 00:32:35,810
is the evidence of General Cao Wei suppressed all of you.

301
00:32:35,810 --> 00:32:40,350
But in this requiem street,

302
00:32:40,350 --> 00:32:44,720
there were numerous famous generals with great fighting spirit over thousand years.

303
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:48,050
What is Cao Yan Bing considered?

304
00:32:48,050 --> 00:32:50,400
Then why are you—

305
00:32:52,160 --> 00:32:54,820
I'm afraid of you.

306
00:32:54,820 --> 00:32:59,590
What if you this weak bone fell into his hand and

307
00:32:59,590 --> 00:33:02,650
say some words you aren't suppose to say?

308
00:33:02,650 --> 00:33:05,550
For example, traces that you aren't suppose to leave.

309
00:33:05,550 --> 00:33:08,870
No matter how weak he is, he is also a requiem general.

310
00:33:08,870 --> 00:33:12,040
By then, just one report from him,

311
00:33:12,040 --> 00:33:16,420
the people who have a headache is us.

312
00:33:23,150 --> 00:33:26,850
Just die under your own knife.

313
00:33:31,760 --> 00:33:34,520
Goodbye, General Fu Shi.

314
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:42,090
  Timing and Subtitles brought to you by The Spiritual Guardians @ Viki 

315
00:33:59,260 --> 00:34:04,960
 Starting from today, you will be the requiem general of Rakshasa street. 

316
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:09,120
  This street, you have the words. ( In charge)  

317
00:34:10,670 --> 00:34:14,000
  Brother, hurry and come back. 

318
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:16,870
 Tang Liuyu 

319
00:34:18,040 --> 00:34:20,400
 Xuan Liang, hurry up go! 

320
00:34:25,250 --> 00:34:29,260
  No need, with the guy who's surname is Cao. 

321

 Rakashasa Street
