When I asked them, they wouldn't tell me anything.

00:21:47,560 --> 00:21:52,530
Because everyone on the bus, except you, died already.

157
00:21:54,370 --> 00:21:56,430
You are the sole survivor.

158
00:21:56,430 --> 00:22:02,440
But when the accident happened, you were 100 feet away from the bus. You better think hard.

Live chat?

176
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:38,610
Don't turn it off. Don't turn it off. Back to the point.

177
00:23:38,610 --> 00:23:43,980
Xia Ling, you surviving in the bus is by pure accident.

178
00:23:43,980 --> 00:23:48,410
You should've already been a dead person.

179
00:23:48,410 --> 00:23:52,170
But your spirit didn't let go like that.

180
00:23:52,170 --> 00:23:56,190
Next, there will be waves of death threats coming at you.

181
00:23:56,190 --> 00:24:01,760
Remember: When you leave every building, you must stop for a while before going out.

182
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:06,450
Don't walk near high buildings and water.

183
00:24:06,450 --> 00:24:09,500
Don't unexpectedly cross busy streets.

184
00:24:09,500 --> 00:24:12,220
Don't eat food or water that strangers give you.

185
00:24:12,220 --> 00:24:15,090
Furthermore, don't use wet hands to touch electrical appliances.

186
00:24:15,090 --> 00:24:20,300
If you want to continue to live on and you're not willing to let your life end when it hasn't even begun.

187
00:24:20,300 --> 00:24:23,050
Your youth hasn't blossomed; yet, it has withered.

188
00:24:23,050 --> 00:24:29,170
You only have to go to this address to save yourself.

189
00:24:30,730 --> 00:24:32,960
Did you call Machine 48?

190
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:37,160
Kung Pao chicken plus a bowl of seaweed soup. The total is 18.5

191
00:24:37,160 --> 00:24:39,830
Sorry, let me pay.

192
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:43,920
I owe you 5 mao.

193
00:24:43,920 --> 00:24:45,570
All right.

194
00:24:47,980 --> 00:24:51,140
- Back to the point.   - Boring

195
00:24:54,970 --> 00:24:57,330
Xia Ling.

196
00:24:57,330 --> 00:24:58,560
Boss.

197
00:24:58,560 --> 00:24:59,920
I already heard about it.

198
00:24:59,920 --> 00:25:03,410
Since you just escaped from a calamity, I hope you'll treasure life more in the future,

199
00:25:03,410 --> 00:25:07,020
treasure living, treasure the beautiful moments of working.

200
00:25:07,020 --> 00:25:08,660
Thanks, Boss.

201
00:25:08,660 --> 00:25:12,410
It's right to be concerned about my employees. Then help pay the property fees.

202
00:25:12,410 --> 00:25:14,030
Huh? Property fees?

203
00:25:14,030 --> 00:25:16,980
Go quickly. After you pay the property fees, you can have a vacation.

204
00:25:39,230 --> 00:25:42,610
Remember: When you leave every building, you must stop for a while before going out.

205
00:25:57,300 --> 00:26:00,050
Do not walk near water.

206
00:26:00,050 --> 00:26:03,890
I don't believe it. I can't be cursed in broad daylight.

207
00:26:26,540 --> 00:26:28,830
Xia Ling, what's wrong? Are you all right?

208
00:26:28,830 --> 00:26:32,270
I was watching you stand by the river for half of the day. Why did you go towards the river?

209
00:26:32,270 --> 00:26:33,800
Good thing, I pulled you.

210
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:36,420
I'm fine. Thank you, Chun Tian.

211
00:26:36,420 --> 00:26:38,910
I'll go back to the company first.

212
00:27:13,100 --> 00:27:16,760
Informing Lord. We have investigated

213
00:27:16,760 --> 00:27:21,550
that Shi Pu entered the gateway to Rakshasa Street.

214
00:27:21,550 --> 00:27:25,060
Cao Yan Bing is the suppressing spirit general of Rakshasa Street.

215
00:27:25,060 --> 00:27:30,110
If there are any unusual movements, his general chain will naturally react.

216
00:27:31,680 --> 00:27:35,900
Why would Shi Pu die by a human's hand without a guardian spirit?

217
00:27:35,900 --> 00:27:40,870
A human without a guardian spirit will be difficult to make a move on in the spirit domain.

218
00:27:40,870 --> 00:27:49,580
He doesn't have a guardian spirit; yet, he can still be a suppressing spirit general all these years. There must be an outstanding point.

219
00:27:49,580 --> 00:27:55,400
Even so, we have already greeted that person.

220
00:27:55,400 --> 00:27:59,630
His general chain should not have been alarmed.

221
00:27:59,630 --> 00:28:06,330
- Could it be that person...?   - Don't need to make any more guesses.

222
00:28:14,060 --> 00:28:18,070
Regardless of any mishaps that person has,

223
00:28:18,070 --> 00:28:22,000
or perhaps she intentionally did it,

224
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:26,810
Cao Yan Bing is the main culprit who murdered Shi Pu.

225
00:28:26,810 --> 00:28:33,500
We can't afford to offend that person, but he is just a suppressing spirit general of Rakshasa Street.

226
00:28:33,500 --> 00:28:38,800
- I don't care.  - What Lord means is...

227
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:45,190
you and Fu Cai will take people to bring the leader of Cao Yan Bing here.

228
00:28:48,140 --> 00:28:51,580
Lord, murdering the requiem general

229
00:28:51,580 --> 00:28:54,410
is a felony.

230
00:28:54,410 --> 00:28:58,420
We were originally felons.

231
00:28:58,420 --> 00:29:04,180
Why should we be afraid of more sins?

232
00:29:04,180 --> 00:29:07,610
Cao Yan Bing.

233
00:29:09,300 --> 00:29:15,230
I do not know why he is called the Fire General.

234
00:29:15,230 --> 00:29:21,140
But when we previously followed Zhong Jia emperor,

235
00:29:21,140 --> 00:29:25,770
they were all generals who ran all over the battlefield.

236
00:29:27,280 --> 00:29:32,710
The blazing flame in front of us

237
00:29:32,710 --> 00:29:36,290
will inevitably stop burning.

238
00:31:03,830 --> 00:31:06,340
Do not unexpectedly cross a busy street.

239
00:31:08,590 --> 00:31:10,040
-...Policeman--  -...died already--

240
00:31:10,040 --> 00:31:12,260
You would've been dead person.

241
00:31:14,800 --> 00:31:17,100
The Grim Reaper did not let you off like this.

242
00:31:17,100 --> 00:31:19,030
- Miss, eat.  - You survived.

243
00:31:19,030 --> 00:31:21,700
Xia Ling, I won't hurt you.

244
00:31:33,620 --> 00:31:38,600
Remember this address. Find a courtyard with a pagoda tree.

245
00:31:38,600 --> 00:31:41,980
The master of the courtyard is Cao Yan Bing.

246
00:31:41,980 --> 00:31:48,030
He can save you. Only he can save you.

251
00:32:46,320 --> 00:32:51,030
I would like to ask. Whose house dooryard here has a big locust tree?

252
00:32:51,720 --> 00:32:52,710
It's you!

253
00:32:52,710 --> 00:32:54,880
I guess you all are General Fu Shi's subordinates.

254
00:32:54,880 --> 00:32:58,450
If anyone intrudes, kill them all!

255
00:33:02,190 --> 00:33:04,000
What place is here?

00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:06,330
This is a different world.

257
00:33:06,330 --> 00:33:08,680
- What are you doing?   - You can't casually hurt others.

258
