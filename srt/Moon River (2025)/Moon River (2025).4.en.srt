and swallows never abandon Heungbu.

6
00:00:22,733 --> 00:00:24,600
Not me.

7
00:00:26,600 --> 00:00:29,000
You caught me.

8
00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:34,167
You ran to me.

9
00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:38,367
So, save me.

10
00:00:40,967 --> 00:00:43,600
Protect me with your all.

11
00:00:48,667 --> 00:00:50,300
That's an order.

12
00:00:56,600 --> 00:00:58,233
Oh, dear.

13
00:01:13,767 --> 00:01:15,533
Correct.

14
00:01:16,167 --> 00:01:18,667
This darn jade hair ornament

15
00:01:18,667 --> 00:01:21,567
belongs to His Highness.

16
00:01:24,376 --> 00:01:25,533
Well,

17
00:01:25,533 --> 00:01:27,767
we don't have time for this.

18
00:01:27,767 --> 00:01:30,867
We must inform His Majesty immediately.

19
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:52,824
[Shot and unconscious for half a month,
he's left Yeongdeok and will reach Hanyang soon.]

20
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:03,433
The Crown Prince is alive?

21
00:02:03,433 --> 00:02:05,333
How troublesome.

22
00:02:09,500 --> 00:02:10,833
Yeo Ri.

23
00:02:10,833 --> 00:02:14,233
Where is Chief Secretary now?

24
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Yum, delicious.

25
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Come here.

26
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:23,133
- Enough eating. Come here now.
- Why are you acting this way?

27
00:02:25,528 --> 00:02:27,492
Jeez!

28
00:02:28,633 --> 00:02:30,167
What are you doing now?

29
00:02:30,167 --> 00:02:31,367
Do you know who I am? How dare...

30
00:02:31,367 --> 00:02:36,400
Neither of us is without blemish,
so just send that court lady away.

31
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:38,033
How...

32
00:02:54,067 --> 00:02:56,900
You're saying you killed the Crown Prince?

33
00:02:56,900 --> 00:02:58,667
Would you believe me if I were you?

34
00:02:58,667 --> 00:03:00,967
You must believe me.

35
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:04,933
My father is searching for the ransom
to offer in my stead.

36
00:03:04,933 --> 00:03:06,933
Why would you strike me when I've done nothing...

37
00:03:06,933 --> 00:03:09,267
As Prince Je Woon's fifth cousin
and maternal uncle,

38
00:03:09,267 --> 00:03:13,067
didn't you try to enthrone Prince Je Woon
instead of the Crown Prince?

39
00:03:17,233 --> 00:03:19,367
What do you want?

40
00:03:19,367 --> 00:03:21,600
Place Prince Je Woon on the throne.

41
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:23,768
And I will

42
00:03:23,768 --> 00:03:25,833
sit beside him.

43
00:03:25,833 --> 00:03:27,967
What must I do?

44
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:32,333
The Left Minister's daughter
tried to make Prince Je Woon?

45
00:03:32,333 --> 00:03:33,333
Yes.

46
00:03:33,333 --> 00:03:36,633
Since the Crown Prince still lives,
I've been ordered to clean up the mess.

47
00:03:36,633 --> 00:03:39,933
Your Majesty, what shall we do?

48
00:03:40,733 --> 00:03:43,367
Now I understand.

49
00:03:43,367 --> 00:03:45,800
- Then it makes sense.
- Pardon?

50
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:50,633
Only grasp half the hand
offered by Left Minister's daughter.

51
00:03:50,633 --> 00:03:55,100
Prince Je Woon seems
destined to die by another's hand.

52
00:04:07,433 --> 00:04:09,500
Jeez.

53
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:13,800
From what I see,

54
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:17,100
he must have saved my leg

55
00:04:17,100 --> 00:04:18,667
to use me like this.

56
00:04:18,667 --> 00:04:21,300
There's no other explanation.

57
00:04:22,167 --> 00:04:24,100
Oh, my.

58
00:04:24,900 --> 00:04:26,500
Alright, again.

59
00:04:34,567 --> 00:04:35,933
Almost there, almost there.

60
00:04:35,933 --> 00:04:37,567
Good.

61
00:04:37,567 --> 00:04:40,216
Oh my.

62
00:04:40,216 --> 00:04:42,432
Jeez.

63
00:04:46,133 --> 00:04:49,600
Is he really asleep right now?

64
00:04:51,768 --> 00:04:54,744
Good grief.

65
00:06:21,700 --> 00:06:23,333
I'm sorry.

66
00:06:24,767 --> 00:06:29,467
Why did you foolishly grab that hot thing?

67
00:06:29,467 --> 00:06:31,267
How silly.

68
00:06:49,467 --> 00:06:51,033
Hey, you're not asleep, right?

69
00:06:51,033 --> 00:06:53,000
Wake up, hey.

70
00:06:57,267 --> 00:06:59,064
Aren't you Nolbu's wife?

71
00:06:59,064 --> 00:07:01,200
Swallow my foot.

72
00:07:04,433 --> 00:07:07,640
[Episode 4 The Swallow
Doesn't Just Repay Kindness]

73
00:08:05,833 --> 00:08:08,400
Did you sleep well?

74
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:10,100
Yes.

75
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:15,400
Are you feeling better?

76
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:17,800
I guess I should stop by the doctor's.

77
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:18,800
Are you feeling very unwell?

78
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:19,833
Let me take a look.

79
00:08:19,833 --> 00:08:21,867
I tried to handle the treatment myself.

80
00:08:21,867 --> 00:08:23,500
Jeez.

81
00:08:29,100 --> 00:08:30,467
Thank you.

82
00:08:30,467 --> 00:08:32,067
Yes.

83
00:08:34,967 --> 00:08:37,267
Now, please take care of her hand.

84
00:08:37,267 --> 00:08:39,033
Yes, understood.

85
00:08:39,033 --> 00:08:40,233
Me?

86
00:08:40,233 --> 00:08:41,600
No, I'm fine.

87
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:45,833
Fine? Your palm is all blistered like that.

88
00:08:46,900 --> 00:08:49,633
I'm fine.

89
00:08:49,633 --> 00:08:51,733
If you don't get treated, I won't either.

90
00:08:51,733 --> 00:08:54,267
Excuse me, undo this for me.

91
00:08:54,267 --> 00:08:55,567
Oh, alright.

92
00:08:55,567 --> 00:08:58,567
- Hurry up.
- Alright.

93
00:08:58,567 --> 00:09:00,267
Here.

94
00:09:00,267 --> 00:09:02,667
That stubbornness of yours...

95
00:09:06,033 --> 00:09:08,233
You should've done this sooner.

96
00:09:21,500 --> 00:09:23,833
Wake up soon.

97
00:09:23,833 --> 00:09:24,900
My lord.

98
00:09:24,900 --> 00:09:27,633
Courier Cha from the Hanyang
Merchant Group has arrived.

99
00:09:27,633 --> 00:09:29,567
Courier Cha?

100
00:09:29,567 --> 00:09:33,900
His Highness sent a letter?

101
00:09:33,900 --> 00:09:36,133
So he's alive.

102
00:09:36,133 --> 00:09:39,433
I clearly delivered it to Eunuch Yoon,
but since that day

103
00:09:39,433 --> 00:09:41,667
I haven't been able to contact Eunuch Yoon.

104
00:09:41,667 --> 00:09:43,533
The palace guards have no intention of moving,

105
00:09:43,533 --> 00:09:47,400
and my access to the palace
has even been restricted.

106
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:51,000
Someone's trying to stop His Highness.

107
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,167
Understood. I'll go myself.

108
00:09:53,167 --> 00:09:55,667
Shouldn't we first inform His Majesty?

109
00:09:55,667 --> 00:09:59,000
No one in the palace can be trusted now.

110
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:02,667
I'll go quietly and bring His Majesty back myself.

111
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:09,600
Young lady.

112
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:11,333
Young lady!

113
00:10:11,333 --> 00:10:12,600
It's an emergency.

114
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:14,633
Prince Je Woon has...

115
00:10:14,633 --> 00:10:16,300
What about him?

116
00:10:34,833 --> 00:10:39,633
A letter from His Highness
has been found at your residence.

117
00:10:39,633 --> 00:10:42,267
What reason did you have to hide the letter?

118
00:10:42,267 --> 00:10:44,400
That's what I want to ask.

119
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:47,400
Why would a letter I've never seen

120
00:10:48,233 --> 00:10:50,200
appear in my residence?

121
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:54,633
Are you saying you didn't know
His Highness was alive?

122
00:10:54,633 --> 00:10:57,033
I knew, and that's why

123
00:10:57,033 --> 00:10:59,700
I sent someone to rescue His Highness.

124
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:01,533
How am I supposed to tell

125
00:11:01,533 --> 00:11:04,967
whether you sent someone to save His Highness

126
00:11:04,967 --> 00:11:06,767
or to harm him?

127
00:11:06,767 --> 00:11:11,200
Why would I ever want to harm His Highness?

128
00:11:14,733 --> 00:11:16,792
You are

129
00:11:16,792 --> 00:11:19,533
the late king's legitimate first son.

130
00:11:19,533 --> 00:11:23,733
If Queen Jangjeong had not been
falsely accused of adultery,

131
00:11:23,733 --> 00:11:27,700
and if the late king had not ordered that

132
00:11:27,700 --> 00:11:31,600
the throne never be passed to you,

133
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:36,400
then you would rightfully
have ascended the throne.

134
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:38,424
I've never

135
00:11:38,424 --> 00:11:40,167
entertained such thoughts.

136
00:11:40,167 --> 00:11:43,600
Would the Grand Queen Dowager think so?

137
00:11:44,533 --> 00:11:46,733
Absolutely not!

138
00:11:46,733 --> 00:11:49,700
If he had intended to assassinate His Highness,

139
00:11:49,700 --> 00:11:54,433
would he have sent the Left Guard Officer
who had served His Highness all his life?

140
00:11:55,367 --> 00:11:58,584
I'll go quietly and bring
His Highness back myself.

141
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:02,233
Are you alright?

142
00:12:02,233 --> 00:12:05,800
Have you come to your senses?

143
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:08,000
I'll go.

144
00:12:08,700 --> 00:12:13,033
If you go, the entire palace will know.

145
00:12:15,433 --> 00:12:20,000
That person is creating unfavorable
circumstances for you.

146
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,667
What have I done?

147
00:12:21,667 --> 00:12:24,300
You know that the Royal Guards face

148
00:12:24,300 --> 00:12:28,400
severe punishment if they fail to properly protect

149
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:30,200
the Crown Prince, don't you?

150
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:33,500
Sometimes, even death must be borne.

151
00:12:33,500 --> 00:12:35,224
Yet

152
00:12:35,224 --> 00:12:37,333
you've let

153
00:12:37,333 --> 00:12:40,800
such a traitor escape.

154
00:12:53,133 --> 00:12:55,733
If it's for Prince Je Woon's sake, turn back.

155
00:12:55,733 --> 00:12:57,800
Nothing will change.

156
00:12:57,800 --> 00:13:00,267
I've lost.

157
00:13:00,267 --> 00:13:02,233
But do you know this?

158
00:13:02,233 --> 00:13:04,696
Amateurs always

159
00:13:04,696 --> 00:13:07,256
choose self-sacrifice.

160
00:13:07,256 --> 00:13:09,200
If even a single hair of Prince Je Woon is harmed,

161
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:11,133
I'll rush to the Investigation Bureau.

162
00:13:11,133 --> 00:13:13,767
Do you think I'll leave you legs to run with?

163
00:13:13,767 --> 00:13:17,200
Even if you break them, I'll crawl there.

164
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:19,567
So if you want to stop me,

165
00:13:19,567 --> 00:13:21,433
you'll have to break my neck first.

166
00:13:21,433 --> 00:13:23,867
Do you think I can't?

167
00:13:23,867 --> 00:13:25,433
Someone!

168
00:13:25,433 --> 00:13:27,067
Yes.

169
00:13:30,400 --> 00:13:31,467
Did you call for me?

170
00:13:31,467 --> 00:13:32,700
Confine Woo Hee to her room,

171
00:13:32,700 --> 00:13:36,033
and don't let her take a single step out
until the royal wedding.

172
00:13:36,033 --> 00:13:38,067
Father.

173
00:13:38,067 --> 00:13:40,233
My apologies, young lady.

174
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,867
If anyone lays a hand on my body,

175
00:13:47,867 --> 00:13:50,300
I'll bite off my tongue and die.

176
00:14:12,900 --> 00:14:14,900
What now?

177
00:14:23,133 --> 00:14:24,733
Oh, dear.

178
00:14:25,867 --> 00:14:28,100
Let's see.

179
00:14:29,433 --> 00:14:31,067
It's him.

180
00:14:31,867 --> 00:14:34,733
My lord, please get down.

181
00:14:34,733 --> 00:14:36,367
Who are you?

182
00:14:36,367 --> 00:14:38,400
Who sent you?

183
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:41,760
Since I've taken the money,

184
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:44,000
shouldn't I honor my loyalty?

185
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,567
What should we do, my lord?

186
00:14:45,567 --> 00:14:46,733
Get down.

187
00:14:46,733 --> 00:14:47,933
Pardon?

188
00:14:47,933 --> 00:14:49,833
It's dangerous to stay on the horse.

189
00:14:49,833 --> 00:14:50,933
Get down and look straight ahead.

190
00:14:50,933 --> 00:14:53,033
Don't look back under any circumstances.

191
00:14:54,067 --> 00:14:55,700
Yes.

192
00:15:06,167 --> 00:15:07,767
I'm down.

193
00:15:07,767 --> 00:15:09,700
What now, my lord?

194
00:15:15,133 --> 00:15:16,733
My lord.

195
00:15:19,967 --> 00:15:21,600
Jeez.

196
00:15:26,167 --> 00:15:28,024
How pathetic to see a man

197
00:15:28,024 --> 00:15:32,500
- cowardly backpedaling to save himself.
- Darn.

198
00:15:32,500 --> 00:15:33,600
Come here!

199
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:36,500
Filth like you don't deserve to live.

200
00:15:36,500 --> 00:15:37,800
Exactly my point.

201
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:39,400
Hand me that axe.

202
00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:43,433
The more you trust someone who betrays you,
the harder they'll strike, huh?

203
00:15:43,433 --> 00:15:45,733
I shouldn't have spared him. Never should've.

204
00:15:45,733 --> 00:15:48,200
Sun Tzu's Art of War states

205
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:52,000
'Appear weak when you are strong.'

206
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:56,233
But since I lack such skills,

207
00:15:56,233 --> 00:15:58,333
my strategy is this.

208
00:15:58,333 --> 00:16:00,533
What nonsense are you spouting now?

209
00:16:01,467 --> 00:16:03,467
Full frontal assault!

210
00:16:22,744 --> 00:16:24,800
Oh my!

211
00:17:15,500 --> 00:17:16,767
Are you alright?

212
00:17:16,767 --> 00:17:18,667
Yes.

213
00:17:18,667 --> 00:17:20,300
Here they are.

214
00:17:21,633 --> 00:17:23,367
What now?

215
00:17:38,767 --> 00:17:41,733
I'll distract them. Run.

216
00:17:51,167 --> 00:17:53,267
Stay alive this time.

217
00:17:55,267 --> 00:17:56,867
Please.

218
00:18:01,867 --> 00:18:03,500
My lord.

219
00:18:07,367 --> 00:18:10,200
I'm a woman who goes all in when I act!

220
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:11,933
What? What?

221
00:18:31,133 --> 00:18:32,733
Oh, my.

222
00:18:44,300 --> 00:18:45,967
Oh, dear.

223
00:18:46,867 --> 00:18:48,467
Darn it.

224
00:18:49,933 --> 00:18:53,144
Hey! Come on!

225
00:18:53,780 --> 00:18:55,631
I kill you!

226
00:18:56,242 --> 00:18:57,368
Go die!

227
00:19:04,733 --> 00:19:06,333
Hey.

228
00:19:20,467 --> 00:19:22,100
Goodness.

229
00:19:24,467 --> 00:19:26,300
My lord.

230
00:19:26,300 --> 00:19:27,900
My lord.

231
00:19:28,533 --> 00:19:30,867
Jeez.

232
00:19:30,867 --> 00:19:32,533
God help us.

233
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,600
Shin Won.

234
00:19:58,267 --> 00:20:00,133
My lord.

235
00:20:00,133 --> 00:20:02,133
I was wrong.

236
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:13,100
You're alive.

237
00:20:13,100 --> 00:20:14,967
You survived.

238
00:20:18,700 --> 00:20:20,300
Thank you.

239
00:20:20,967 --> 00:20:23,900
Thank you for staying alive, Shin Won.

240
00:20:25,333 --> 00:20:26,333
Your Highness.

241
00:20:26,333 --> 00:20:28,833
More urgently, Prince Je Woon is in danger.

242
00:20:30,967 --> 00:20:32,867
Why Prince Je Woon?

243
00:20:34,133 --> 00:20:36,300
The Crown Prince is alive?

244
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:41,368
The matter of Prince Je Woon can wait

245
00:20:41,368 --> 00:20:42,733
until after the Crown Prince returns...

246
00:20:42,733 --> 00:20:46,100
Are you certain His Highness will return?

247
00:20:46,100 --> 00:20:49,200
They tried to assassinate His Highness.

248
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:54,733
What would people driven to the edge be afraid of?

249
00:20:55,467 --> 00:21:00,667
Do you truly believe Prince Je Woon
tried to murder the Crown Prince?

250
00:21:00,667 --> 00:21:04,967
The truth doesn't matter.

251
00:21:04,967 --> 00:21:08,600
What matters is that His Highness is alive,

252
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:13,938
and that he must return safely.

253
00:21:13,938 --> 00:21:15,600
I mean His Highness the Crown Prince,

254
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:18,680
whom Your Majesty protected

255
00:21:18,680 --> 00:21:21,167
by sacrificing all those he loves.

256
00:21:24,833 --> 00:21:27,167
Do as you wish.

257
00:21:28,867 --> 00:21:32,067
I obey your command, Your Majesty.

258
00:21:32,067 --> 00:21:34,133
The Left Minister's action means

259
00:21:34,133 --> 00:21:36,667
he has no intention of sparing Prince Je Woon.

260
00:21:36,667 --> 00:21:38,567
But the problem is that

261
00:21:38,567 --> 00:21:41,533
the Left Minister isn't the only one
who wants Je Woon dead.

262
00:21:41,533 --> 00:21:44,033
What do you mean by that?

263
00:21:47,067 --> 00:21:49,167
This actually works in our favor.

264
00:21:49,167 --> 00:21:50,904
There is neither

265
00:21:50,904 --> 00:21:54,167
the Crown Prince
nor Prince Je Woon with legitimate claim.

266
00:21:54,167 --> 00:21:59,200
If the king dies without an heir...

267
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:02,133
The right to designate a successor
would fall to the Grand Queen Dowager.

268
00:22:02,133 --> 00:22:05,633
While Je Woon's exiled
and the Left Minister's distracted,

269
00:22:05,633 --> 00:22:07,700
they'll poison His Majesty.

270
00:22:07,700 --> 00:22:11,800
Her Majesty has never forgotten
the Gyesa Year incident.

271
00:22:11,800 --> 00:22:14,700
With the public watching,
even the Left Minister won't be able to

272
00:22:14,700 --> 00:22:16,300
exile Prince Je Woon outright.

273
00:22:16,300 --> 00:22:18,967
They'll eliminate Je Woon before I arrive.

274
00:22:18,967 --> 00:22:23,067
Within six or seven days of
reaching Hanyang from Yeongdeok.

275
00:22:23,067 --> 00:22:25,000
When did you send the letter?

276
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:26,800
Today is the fifth day.

277
00:22:29,633 --> 00:22:31,467
Soon it will be the sixth.

278
00:22:31,467 --> 00:22:34,100
Even at full speed from now, two days remain.

279
00:22:34,100 --> 00:22:36,167
Your current condition
makes that impossible. Moreover...

280
00:22:36,167 --> 00:22:39,500
My men are lying in ambush along every land route

281
00:22:39,500 --> 00:22:42,133
from Yeongdeok to Hanyang.

282
00:22:42,133 --> 00:22:46,833
You'll never reach Hanyang.

283
00:22:46,833 --> 00:22:49,167
You still haven't come to your senses.

284
00:22:49,167 --> 00:22:52,300
Hey, the land routes are cut off,
are the waterways too?

285
00:22:52,300 --> 00:22:53,933
The sea route isn't blocked, is it?

286
00:22:53,933 --> 00:22:55,200
What do you mean?

287
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:57,833
Is there any way to go by boat?

288
00:22:59,933 --> 00:23:02,067
Follow me.

289
00:23:03,067 --> 00:23:06,700
I've got an ace hidden nearby.

290
00:23:06,700 --> 00:23:09,500
[Segokseon]
I hate owing favors.

291
00:23:09,500 --> 00:23:11,633
Ah, no need.

292
00:23:11,633 --> 00:23:13,433
When did you...

293
00:23:13,433 --> 00:23:17,167
That porter once saved the ship officer's life.

294
00:23:17,167 --> 00:23:20,433
As a token of gratitude,
they'll set the ship afloat for us.

295
00:23:20,433 --> 00:23:23,600
We'll reach Mapo Port by morning.

296
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:30,367
I've incurred a huge debt to that girl, Dal I.

297
00:23:30,367 --> 00:23:33,833
Will you be going to Hanyang with her?

298
00:23:34,450 --> 00:23:37,067
She's saved me countless times,

299
00:23:37,067 --> 00:23:38,467
so of course I should repay her.

300
00:23:38,467 --> 00:23:42,400
Can't the reward be sent separately to Boryeong?

301
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:43,767
Hey.

302
00:23:43,767 --> 00:23:47,667
Would this ship sail without that girl?

303
00:23:50,900 --> 00:23:52,933
And gratitude

304
00:23:52,933 --> 00:23:55,400
isn't just about money, you understand?

305
00:23:58,067 --> 00:24:01,767
Why are you so heartless, Shin Won?

306
00:24:10,033 --> 00:24:11,867
Thank you.

307
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:21,467
Do as Your Highness wishes.

308
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:28,667
Did you laugh? You laughed at me?

309
00:24:28,667 --> 00:24:29,967
Need another beating, do you?

310
00:24:29,967 --> 00:24:31,067
No, it's not that

311
00:24:31,067 --> 00:24:32,800
I laughed, but now

312
00:24:32,800 --> 00:24:36,833
the night air is so cold I coughed,

313
00:24:36,833 --> 00:24:38,008
so that's all it was.

314
00:24:38,008 --> 00:24:40,567
You're misunderstanding.

315
00:24:40,567 --> 00:24:42,167
Hold on.

316
00:24:51,133 --> 00:24:53,048
Your coat

317
00:24:53,048 --> 00:24:55,733
looks good, huh?

318
00:24:55,733 --> 00:24:57,333
Pardon?

319
00:25:13,767 --> 00:25:17,667
If you glare at the river like that,
do you think the boat will go faster?

320
00:25:20,267 --> 00:25:21,800
Come sit.

321
00:25:21,800 --> 00:25:23,800
Let me change the dressings.

322
00:25:40,033 --> 00:25:42,233
Prince Je Woon faces treason charges.

323
00:25:42,233 --> 00:25:43,667
The Prince?

324
00:25:43,667 --> 00:25:45,967
Wait, hold on.

325
00:25:45,967 --> 00:25:47,667
If it's treason,

326
00:25:48,333 --> 00:25:49,800
doesn't that mean his life's in danger?

327
00:25:49,800 --> 00:25:52,000
I have to go.

328
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:54,633
Because I'm the only one
who can save Prince Je Woon.

329
00:25:55,633 --> 00:25:57,233
But...

330
00:25:58,567 --> 00:26:01,700
I'm scared I'll be too late.

331
00:26:06,167 --> 00:26:08,367
You know that saying,

332
00:26:08,367 --> 00:26:10,167
- 'The more urgent it is...'
- 'Go back?'

333
00:26:10,167 --> 00:26:11,900
If it's urgent, why turn back?

334
00:26:11,900 --> 00:26:15,700
When things are urgent, double down on strategy!

335
00:26:55,033 --> 00:26:57,667
As soon as we reach Mapo Port,

336
00:26:57,667 --> 00:26:59,333
tie the bandages tight,

337
00:27:01,233 --> 00:27:03,000
brace yourselves,

338
00:27:04,933 --> 00:27:09,133
and go straight ahead, okay?

339
00:27:11,133 --> 00:27:12,667
Alright.

340
00:27:12,667 --> 00:27:15,167
If I go straight and have to turn back again,

341
00:27:15,167 --> 00:27:17,167
wait at the Hanyang Merchant Group.

342
00:27:17,167 --> 00:27:18,833
Don't fly off to Gangnam.

343
00:27:18,833 --> 00:27:20,200
Why suddenly mention Gangnam?

344
00:27:20,200 --> 00:27:21,833
You called yourself a swallow,

345
00:27:21,833 --> 00:27:23,833
but a swallow that leaves
Heungbu behind doesn't fly away.

346
00:27:23,833 --> 00:27:25,467
Ah.

347
00:27:26,800 --> 00:27:28,367
Just wait and see.

348
00:27:28,367 --> 00:27:30,500
The gourd is yours to take.

349
00:27:30,500 --> 00:27:32,700
That will be an enormous one.

350
00:27:32,700 --> 00:27:36,133
Don't get too startled when you see it.

351
00:27:36,133 --> 00:27:37,333
Don't worry.

352
00:27:37,333 --> 00:27:40,600
Me? I'm a woman with a liking
for material comforts.

353
00:27:52,367 --> 00:27:54,700
The moon's so beautiful tonight.

354
00:27:59,267 --> 00:28:01,100
It really is.

355
00:28:01,100 --> 00:28:05,000
Even though it's not full, it's pretty.

356
00:28:06,500 --> 00:28:11,600
<i>♫ May there never be ♫</i>

357
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:17,100
<i>♫ Not even once ♫</i>

358
00:28:17,100 --> 00:28:25,767
<i>♫ A season of sorrow or pain for you ♫</i>

359
00:28:27,033 --> 00:28:32,200
<i>♫ On sleepless nights ♫</i>

360
00:28:32,200 --> 00:28:37,667
<i>♫ May you never feel alone ♫</i>

361
00:28:37,667 --> 00:28:45,016
<i>♫ May you live carrying only good memories ♫</i>

362
00:28:54,900 --> 00:28:56,733
My lord.

363
00:28:56,733 --> 00:28:58,967
I'll accompany you.

364
00:29:00,533 --> 00:29:02,167
My lord.

365
00:29:18,467 --> 00:29:21,700
My lord, who are you looking for?

366
00:29:21,700 --> 00:29:23,333
No one.

367
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:33,367
Step aside.

368
00:29:33,367 --> 00:29:35,167
Before I slit my throat and die.

369
00:29:35,167 --> 00:29:36,567
What are you all doing?

370
00:29:36,567 --> 00:29:39,600
Don't you know our young lady
is someone who does what she says?

371
00:30:10,400 --> 00:30:12,933
[Mapo Fortress]

372
00:30:29,033 --> 00:30:31,000
Wow.

373
00:30:31,667 --> 00:30:34,700
It certainly wasn't
the kind of clothing like that.

374
00:30:43,700 --> 00:30:45,900
Wait at the Hanyang Merchant Group.

375
00:30:45,900 --> 00:30:47,500
Understood.

376
00:30:49,733 --> 00:30:52,367
Take care of yourself.

377
00:30:52,367 --> 00:30:54,100
Yes, I will.

378
00:30:59,467 --> 00:31:01,067
Let's go now.

379
00:31:05,133 --> 00:31:08,733
Did you see Prince Je Woon
being exiled in the marketplace earlier?

380
00:31:08,733 --> 00:31:11,467
They say he's being taken
to some island off Yeongdeok?

381
00:31:11,467 --> 00:31:15,633
I saw. Ugh, what a cruel fate.

382
00:31:15,633 --> 00:31:17,300
[Sa Hour: 9 AM to 11 AM]
I must enter the palace before Sa hour.

383
00:31:17,300 --> 00:31:18,367
Sa hour?

384
00:31:18,367 --> 00:31:22,100
His Majesty skips morning court
and takes breakfast at Sa hour.

385
00:31:22,100 --> 00:31:24,000
[Leegak: 30 mins]
He takes tonic broth half an hour after eating.

386
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:25,467
We should head to the palace immediately.

387
00:31:25,467 --> 00:31:27,200
But Prince Je Woon is also in danger.

388
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:29,300
If the exile destination's an island,
the Left Minister

389
00:31:29,300 --> 00:31:32,500
will eliminate Je Woon aboard that ship.

390
00:31:32,500 --> 00:31:34,333
That would be the cleanest.

391
00:31:34,333 --> 00:31:37,600
To take even the ruffians with us,
we cannot afford to split our manpower.

392
00:31:37,600 --> 00:31:40,800
Your Highness, you must choose.

393
00:32:06,500 --> 00:32:08,267
Is everything prepared?

394
00:32:08,267 --> 00:32:09,533
Yes.

395
00:32:09,533 --> 00:32:13,433
The ship carrying Prince Je Woon
will meet a storm and sink.

396
00:32:20,767 --> 00:32:23,400
<i>This works better.</i>

397
00:32:24,100 --> 00:32:25,688
<i>There is neither</i>

398
00:32:25,688 --> 00:32:29,300
<i>the Crown Prince
nor Prince Je Woon with legitimate claim.</i>

399
00:32:30,500 --> 00:32:34,100
<i>If the king dies</i>

400
00:32:34,100 --> 00:32:37,000
<i>without an heir...</i>

401
00:32:58,567 --> 00:33:00,400
Your Majesty!

402
00:33:07,967 --> 00:33:09,067
Your Majesty!

403
00:33:09,067 --> 00:33:12,700
The Crown Prince has returned.

404
00:33:12,700 --> 00:33:14,733
Bring him in immediately.

405
00:33:15,433 --> 00:33:17,967
<i>Anyone could prevent Father's poisoning,</i>

406
00:33:17,967 --> 00:33:21,500
[Jeongyo: Royal Edict]
<i>but only His Majesty can revoke the exile.</i>

407
00:33:22,600 --> 00:33:24,533
<i>Only I can do this.</i>

408
00:33:24,533 --> 00:33:26,867
<i>This is headpiece I sent with the letter,</i>

409
00:33:26,867 --> 00:33:29,400
<i>proof that I'm still alive.</i>

410
00:33:30,067 --> 00:33:31,933
<i>You go to the palace.</i>

411
00:33:46,533 --> 00:33:49,133
<i>I'm going to Je Woon.</i>

412
00:33:49,133 --> 00:33:50,733
Brother.

413
00:33:56,600 --> 00:33:59,480
Brother!

414
00:34:19,067 --> 00:34:22,800
Your Majesty, I have returned too late.

415
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:25,500
For disturbing royal peace
and confusing the people,

416
00:34:25,500 --> 00:34:28,400
please punish my filial impiety and disloyalty.

417
00:34:28,400 --> 00:34:30,333
No.

418
00:34:30,333 --> 00:34:32,833
You've lived, and that is enough.

419
00:34:32,833 --> 00:34:35,133
That's all that matters.

420
00:34:35,133 --> 00:34:39,667
Though I faced mortal dangers returning,

421
00:34:39,667 --> 00:34:42,967
Prince Je Woon's help brought me safely to court.

422
00:34:42,967 --> 00:34:46,600
Please grant Prince Je Woon due honors.

423
00:34:46,600 --> 00:34:48,700
I shall do so.

424
00:34:51,633 --> 00:34:53,933
This wasn't coincidence.

425
00:34:53,933 --> 00:34:58,767
The Crown Prince perfectly
understood my desperation.

426
00:34:58,767 --> 00:35:04,167
He seemed oblivious, but he had
fully grasped the situation inside the palace.

427
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:07,800
Right after Prince Je Woon left for exile,

428
00:35:07,800 --> 00:35:09,933
he had already predicted that
I would poison His Majesty,

429
00:35:09,933 --> 00:35:12,900
and he even remembered the exact time

430
00:35:12,900 --> 00:35:16,333
His Majesty takes his tonic broth.

431
00:35:17,800 --> 00:35:19,928
The Crown Prince

432
00:35:19,928 --> 00:35:22,167
is a tiger.

433
00:35:26,633 --> 00:35:28,567
The moment the Left Guard Officer entered,

434
00:35:28,567 --> 00:35:32,667
he immediately noticed
the arsenic on the tonic bowl.

435
00:35:33,900 --> 00:35:36,633
You must've told him, didn't you?

436
00:35:36,633 --> 00:35:38,767
Yes.

437
00:35:38,767 --> 00:35:43,733
It seems the Grand Queen Dowager's
luck is shining today.

438
00:35:43,733 --> 00:35:46,433
What will you do now?

439
00:35:46,433 --> 00:35:49,033
To stand against the Left Minister,

440
00:35:49,033 --> 00:35:51,567
we must have the Grand Royal Dowager's support.

441
00:35:51,567 --> 00:35:53,367
But Your Majesty,

442
00:35:53,367 --> 00:35:55,333
they tried to assassinate you.

443
00:35:55,333 --> 00:35:58,600
If you let this slide,
what's to stop them next time?

444
00:35:58,600 --> 00:36:01,333
Save this for your future use.

445
00:36:01,333 --> 00:36:03,167
When the Left Minister falls,

446
00:36:03,167 --> 00:36:07,800
you'll need your own weapon to keep
the Grand Queen Dowager from seizing power.

447
00:36:14,833 --> 00:36:16,667
Forgive me, brother.

448
00:36:16,667 --> 00:36:17,800
Why?

449
00:36:17,800 --> 00:36:20,967
This is the Chief Secretary's fault, not yours.

450
00:36:35,533 --> 00:36:39,000
Do you trust me, brother?

451
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:42,400
What if I truly intended to kill you?

452
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:44,967
Yes, I do.

453
00:36:44,967 --> 00:36:47,000
Because you're family.

454
00:36:50,733 --> 00:36:53,133
And I know the real culprit.

455
00:36:53,133 --> 00:36:55,800
I saw who shot at me on the cliff.

456
00:36:55,800 --> 00:36:57,667
What do you mean?

457
00:36:57,667 --> 00:36:59,667
The Left Minister's daughter.

458
00:37:01,433 --> 00:37:05,733
I'd be dead if not for Dal I.

459
00:37:06,933 --> 00:37:08,467
Dal I?

460
00:37:08,467 --> 00:37:11,300
Did you meet Dal I at Sinjusa Temple?

461
00:37:11,300 --> 00:37:12,933
Huh?

462
00:37:13,800 --> 00:37:15,867
How do you know that?

463
00:37:15,867 --> 00:37:17,933
That she went to Sinjusa Temple?

464
00:37:18,900 --> 00:37:19,900
I heard.

465
00:37:19,900 --> 00:37:22,167
She said she'd stop by before leaving.

466
00:37:24,433 --> 00:37:26,933
Ah, about Dal I.

467
00:37:26,933 --> 00:37:30,067
I told her to stay in Hanyang for a while,

468
00:37:30,067 --> 00:37:32,300
but she doesn't have anywhere to stay.

469
00:37:32,300 --> 00:37:34,300
Could she stay at your place temporarily?

470
00:37:34,300 --> 00:37:35,967
Is Dal I in Hanyang now?

471
00:37:35,967 --> 00:37:38,400
Yes, she's at the Hanyang Merchant Group.

472
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:40,533
Why would you send her there?

473
00:37:40,533 --> 00:37:43,233
What if the Master Leader notices her?

474
00:37:43,233 --> 00:37:44,833
Why would that matter?

475
00:37:47,667 --> 00:37:49,267
Brother.

476
00:37:49,267 --> 00:37:52,333
The court ladies Her Majesty keeps
sending to Donggung Palace

477
00:37:52,333 --> 00:37:55,033
all came through the head of
Hanyang Merchant Group.

478
00:37:55,033 --> 00:37:56,800
And they say Dal I resembles
Her Highness, the Crown Princess.

479
00:37:56,800 --> 00:38:01,267
If the Queen Dowager learns Dal I saved our lives,

480
00:38:01,267 --> 00:38:03,800
do you think she'll let Dal I live?

481
00:38:07,933 --> 00:38:10,000
Hey, hey, hey.

482
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:11,700
Go quickly!

483
00:38:11,700 --> 00:38:15,233
Bring Dal I back right now!

484
00:38:15,233 --> 00:38:18,300
Run, run faster!

485
00:38:24,967 --> 00:38:26,904
I heard you almost got exiled.

486
00:38:26,904 --> 00:38:29,467
Are you alright?

487
00:38:29,467 --> 00:38:30,800
As you can see, I'm fine.

488
00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:32,500
What a relief.

489
00:38:33,700 --> 00:38:37,167
And... is the secret inspector doing well?

490
00:38:37,167 --> 00:38:39,433
- Uh, he's...
- He was shot.

491
00:38:39,433 --> 00:38:41,733
The journey was rough, and he got into fights,

492
00:38:41,733 --> 00:38:43,833
so his wounds worsened.

493
00:38:43,833 --> 00:38:45,867
He lost a lot of blood.

494
00:38:45,867 --> 00:38:48,200
I doubt he received proper treatment.

495
00:38:48,200 --> 00:38:50,167
What about meals?

496
00:38:50,167 --> 00:38:51,600
Is he eating well?

497
00:38:51,600 --> 00:38:52,600
- Ugh.
- Ugh.

498
00:38:52,600 --> 00:38:55,700
His strength has really faded,
so he needs to eat well.

499
00:38:55,700 --> 00:38:58,900
To regain his strength, he needs to eat
everything without picking and choosing,

500
00:38:58,900 --> 00:39:01,800
but he looks like the kind who is a picky eater.

501
00:39:03,567 --> 00:39:06,867
Why haven't you answered yet?

502
00:39:07,767 --> 00:39:09,833
You've been bombarding me with questions,

503
00:39:09,833 --> 00:39:11,967
leaving me no time to respond.

504
00:39:11,967 --> 00:39:12,967
Did I do that?

505
00:39:12,967 --> 00:39:15,033
Goodness.

506
00:39:15,033 --> 00:39:17,667
Seems you've grown closer to him.

507
00:39:17,667 --> 00:39:21,133
The depth of your concern
for him surpasses that for me.

508
00:39:21,133 --> 00:39:22,167
It stings a bit.

509
00:39:22,167 --> 00:39:25,700
Oh, come on.

510
00:39:25,700 --> 00:39:27,700
It's because of the compensation money.

511
00:39:27,700 --> 00:39:30,667
He promised a hefty sum.

512
00:39:30,667 --> 00:39:35,567
I need to get that money, so I can pay off
your debt and all that, right?

513
00:39:35,567 --> 00:39:39,200
If that's your worry, don't fret.

514
00:39:40,567 --> 00:39:43,600
All of that is yours.

515
00:39:54,567 --> 00:39:56,167
Everything...

516
00:40:07,300 --> 00:40:10,133
What will happen to me now?

517
00:40:11,667 --> 00:40:14,067
The Crown Prince has returned.

518
00:40:14,933 --> 00:40:17,733
Nothing will change.

519
00:40:17,733 --> 00:40:21,467
Even if the Crown Prince
or His Majesty dies again,

520
00:40:21,467 --> 00:40:24,300
nothing will change.

521
00:40:25,967 --> 00:40:29,333
You will take the seat I've prepared.

522
00:40:30,667 --> 00:40:34,933
As you said, I have no other choice but you.

523
00:40:34,933 --> 00:40:37,700
But the throne is different.

524
00:40:37,700 --> 00:40:39,000
If His Majesty dies,

525
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:43,000
another royal relative will take his place.

526
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:47,433
Then why can't it be Prince Je Woon?

527
00:40:48,267 --> 00:40:50,700
Because he's the late king's son.

528
00:40:51,767 --> 00:40:54,733
And the son of Queen Jangjeong.

529
00:41:04,667 --> 00:41:07,433
If you fear he'll seek revenge,
that worry is groundless.

530
00:41:07,433 --> 00:41:10,467
Prince Je Woon even tried to
take my crime upon himself.

531
00:41:10,467 --> 00:41:13,100
And now the biggest reason is

532
00:41:13,733 --> 00:41:15,667
you.

533
00:41:15,667 --> 00:41:20,667
What evidence do you have that
Prince Je Woon won't seek revenge on me?

534
00:41:20,667 --> 00:41:23,700
Your affection for him, is it not?

535
00:41:23,700 --> 00:41:26,967
You killed the Crown Prince for Prince Je Woon,

536
00:41:26,967 --> 00:41:30,600
and Prince Je Woon sacrificed his life for you.

537
00:41:30,600 --> 00:41:34,633
Such affection makes us vulnerable.

538
00:41:34,633 --> 00:41:37,767
There's no guarantee you won't be
swayed by Prince Je Woon

539
00:41:37,767 --> 00:41:40,967
and turn against me.

540
00:41:41,967 --> 00:41:45,633
So now, wake up

541
00:41:47,200 --> 00:41:48,833
from this empty dream.

542
00:42:01,433 --> 00:42:03,267
Wait, she sent all these back?

543
00:42:03,267 --> 00:42:04,633
Why?

544
00:42:04,633 --> 00:42:06,233
Well,

545
00:42:07,533 --> 00:42:12,200
they say she returned everything
except her travel expenses to Hanyang.

546
00:42:12,200 --> 00:42:14,933
What kind of merchant is that? Huh?

547
00:42:14,933 --> 00:42:16,933
She seems like proper merchants to me.

548
00:42:16,933 --> 00:42:18,967
She only took the silver pieces here.

549
00:42:18,967 --> 00:42:21,200
Her accounting is perfectly precise.

550
00:42:21,200 --> 00:42:23,900
What shall we do with all these?

551
00:42:24,833 --> 00:42:26,488
Then

552
00:42:26,488 --> 00:42:29,833
prepare a box with as many small
and expensive items as possible, understood?

553
00:42:29,833 --> 00:42:31,567
Make sure it doesn't look burdensome, okay?

554
00:42:31,567 --> 00:42:33,167
Yes.

555
00:42:40,800 --> 00:42:42,400
Wait.

556
00:42:43,033 --> 00:42:44,633
Yes?

557
00:42:45,367 --> 00:42:50,400
Inspector said he'd really like you
to wear this outfit when you come out.

558
00:43:12,467 --> 00:43:15,600
'You thought you could buy
my favor with something like this?'

559
00:43:17,233 --> 00:43:19,167
I knew you'd act like this.

560
00:43:19,167 --> 00:43:22,233
I never imagined you'd be moved
so much by a single dress.

561
00:43:22,233 --> 00:43:26,300
Something so beautiful isn't 'just a dress.'

562
00:43:30,633 --> 00:43:33,333
A nobody like me would be punished for

563
00:43:33,333 --> 00:43:34,800
wearing something like this.

564
00:43:34,800 --> 00:43:37,500
If you don't wear that garment,
you'll be punished.

565
00:43:37,500 --> 00:43:39,567
You may not realize it, but you

566
00:43:39,567 --> 00:43:42,033
have accomplished something extraordinary.

567
00:43:42,667 --> 00:43:48,100
When you find out later, you'll regret
having settled it all with just one dress.

568
00:43:50,333 --> 00:43:51,567
Put them on and come out.

569
00:43:51,567 --> 00:43:53,667
I'll see if they suit you well.

570
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:05,536
What now?

571
00:44:06,136 --> 00:44:07,567
Huh?

572
00:44:09,700 --> 00:44:12,133
No wonder I feel so glad.

573
00:44:12,933 --> 00:44:15,800
You even recognize me
by the sound of my footsteps.

574
00:44:16,567 --> 00:44:20,633
Too much has been broken
between us for such words.

575
00:44:20,633 --> 00:44:23,433
This is to restore things to their rightful place.

576
00:44:32,533 --> 00:44:36,100
Why do you always climb high places?

577
00:44:36,100 --> 00:44:40,167
Because Queen Mother is in heaven.

578
00:44:40,167 --> 00:44:42,040
Do you

579
00:44:42,040 --> 00:44:43,833
miss your mother?

580
00:44:45,100 --> 00:44:48,632
Is that your...

581
00:44:48,632 --> 00:44:50,700
dream?

582
00:44:50,700 --> 00:44:52,633
My dream is

583
00:44:54,600 --> 00:44:57,336
to return

584
00:44:57,336 --> 00:44:58,767
to the past.

585
00:44:58,767 --> 00:45:00,400
You surely didn't

586
00:45:01,133 --> 00:45:03,567
do all this because of something I said?

587
00:45:03,567 --> 00:45:06,500
Not once have I forgotten your dream.

588
00:45:06,500 --> 00:45:08,408
Thus

589
00:45:08,408 --> 00:45:09,667
it became my dream.

590
00:45:09,667 --> 00:45:11,533
Since it can't be achieved, it remains a dream.

591
00:45:11,533 --> 00:45:13,344
You should

592
00:45:14,136 --> 00:45:16,233
wake up from that dream too.

593
00:45:20,133 --> 00:45:22,667
I'm not sure if this is right.

594
00:45:22,667 --> 00:45:24,467
I mean, wearing something like this.

595
00:45:32,067 --> 00:45:33,816
It seems

596
00:45:33,816 --> 00:45:35,900
you have a visitor.

597
00:45:45,033 --> 00:45:47,000
Not a visitor,

598
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:49,067
but my woman.

599
00:45:49,067 --> 00:45:52,033
The woman who will build a family with me.

600
00:45:52,033 --> 00:45:54,433
So, could you please leave now?

601
00:45:54,433 --> 00:45:57,867
As you see, I have plans.

602
00:46:01,967 --> 00:46:04,567
I haven't torn up the contract yet.

603
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:17,800
Stop.

604
00:46:30,667 --> 00:46:33,767
You seem to be under some misunderstanding.

605
00:46:33,767 --> 00:46:37,000
You're not in a position to command me.

606
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:38,900
A mere gentry woman

607
00:46:38,900 --> 00:46:41,267
cannot command a royal relative.

608
00:46:41,267 --> 00:46:43,576
The only reason

609
00:46:43,576 --> 00:46:46,552
I followed your words until now was love,

610
00:46:46,552 --> 00:46:48,300
and

611
00:46:52,067 --> 00:46:54,533
the one who loved you

612
00:46:57,733 --> 00:46:59,400
is dead now.

613
00:47:20,633 --> 00:47:22,233
I'm sorry.

614
00:47:22,967 --> 00:47:24,867
Are you alright?

615
00:47:25,667 --> 00:47:27,533
Well enough.

616
00:47:27,533 --> 00:47:29,900
You come first, right?

617
00:47:29,900 --> 00:47:34,600
Before Inspector
and the Left Minister's daughter, right?

618
00:47:36,267 --> 00:47:37,848
Now,

619
00:47:37,848 --> 00:47:40,767
what does order matter anymore?

620
00:47:41,433 --> 00:47:43,533
Why don't you go to her?

621
00:47:45,233 --> 00:47:47,100
To save lives.

622
00:47:48,200 --> 00:47:50,767
For her and me,

623
00:47:50,767 --> 00:47:54,567
this is the only way to survive.

624
00:47:54,567 --> 00:47:56,120
So

625
00:47:56,856 --> 00:47:59,300
will you help me?

626
00:48:00,767 --> 00:48:04,433
I still have your contract, you know?

627
00:48:06,133 --> 00:48:07,967
Yes.

628
00:48:07,967 --> 00:48:10,667
A debtor like me has no power.

629
00:48:10,667 --> 00:48:12,300
I must follow.

630
00:48:39,067 --> 00:48:42,400
Your Highness, you look cheerful.

631
00:48:44,600 --> 00:48:46,833
Cheerful, you say?

632
00:48:47,633 --> 00:48:49,200
A true gentleman finds

633
00:48:49,200 --> 00:48:53,367
great joy in repaying kindness
and practicing virtue.

634
00:48:53,367 --> 00:48:56,500
Or something like that.

635
00:48:56,500 --> 00:48:58,867
I hope your heart is truly that of a gentleman.

636
00:48:58,867 --> 00:49:00,833
You'll soon have a royal marriage.

637
00:49:00,833 --> 00:49:02,300
If people see a woman around Your Highness...

638
00:49:02,300 --> 00:49:04,867
Especially one who resembles
the deposed Crown Princess,

639
00:49:04,867 --> 00:49:08,467
not only would the porter be in danger,

640
00:49:08,467 --> 00:49:12,433
but the Left Minister's surveillance
of Your Highness would intensify.

641
00:49:12,433 --> 00:49:16,067
It's simply a repayment to the one
who saved my life, nothing more.

642
00:49:16,067 --> 00:49:18,167
So this is the last time.

643
00:49:21,767 --> 00:49:23,367
Today...

644
00:49:25,633 --> 00:49:28,133
Today is the very last.

645
00:49:28,133 --> 00:49:30,700
Oh, my. So beautiful.

646
00:49:53,567 --> 00:49:55,267
My lord!

647
00:49:59,400 --> 00:50:01,100
Again, again, again.

648
00:50:01,100 --> 00:50:03,900
That radiant smile again.

649
00:50:19,800 --> 00:50:20,833
Wow.

650
00:50:20,833 --> 00:50:23,267
This is it!

651
00:50:24,400 --> 00:50:27,967
Why does this simple rice soup move you more

652
00:50:27,967 --> 00:50:30,033
than all the treasures I sent you?

653
00:50:30,033 --> 00:50:32,200
This isn't just ordinary rice soup.

654
00:50:32,200 --> 00:50:35,867
This rice soup saved my leg and your life too.

655
00:50:41,333 --> 00:50:43,233
Truly,

656
00:50:43,233 --> 00:50:45,240
it is

657
00:50:45,240 --> 00:50:47,633
a remarkable bowl of rice soup.

658
00:50:50,467 --> 00:50:52,900
Now that we've had the rice soup,

659
00:50:53,767 --> 00:50:56,367
it's truly goodbye to you.

660
00:50:56,367 --> 00:50:58,000
Already?

661
00:51:01,267 --> 00:51:03,967
I hear there's a firework show later.

662
00:51:03,967 --> 00:51:08,533
Why not watch it before leaving?

663
00:51:08,533 --> 00:51:10,333
- A firework show?
- Yes.

664
00:51:10,333 --> 00:51:14,867
They say the fireworks are in honor
of His Highness, the Crown Prince,

665
00:51:14,867 --> 00:51:16,536
who recently went missing

666
00:51:16,536 --> 00:51:18,367
but returned safely.

667
00:51:21,733 --> 00:51:22,967
I'm fine.

668
00:51:22,967 --> 00:51:25,067
I've seen firework show all over the provinces.

669
00:51:25,067 --> 00:51:26,700
Even so,

670
00:51:26,700 --> 00:51:28,664
it'll be

671
00:51:28,664 --> 00:51:30,744
your first time seeing firework show

672
00:51:30,744 --> 00:51:32,600
in Hanyang, right?

673
00:51:41,367 --> 00:51:42,867
Alright.

674
00:51:42,867 --> 00:51:45,700
Let's watch the firework show together.

675
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:56,833
Ah, this is it.

676
00:52:14,667 --> 00:52:16,400
Wait a moment.

677
00:52:17,800 --> 00:52:20,833
Oh, no. My heel's blistered.

678
00:52:20,833 --> 00:52:23,100
I'm not used to wearing these.

679
00:52:23,100 --> 00:52:25,800
You wait over there.

680
00:52:25,800 --> 00:52:26,800
Where are you going?

681
00:52:26,800 --> 00:52:28,633
It won't take long.

682
00:52:28,633 --> 00:52:32,800
Shin Won and I will go together.
Se Dol, you stay here and keep watch, got it?

683
00:52:32,800 --> 00:52:34,400
My lord.

684
00:52:37,133 --> 00:52:39,233
What's this about?

685
00:52:41,833 --> 00:52:46,367
Where can I get shoes that
suit the autumn leaf type?

686
00:52:46,367 --> 00:52:51,000
She probably won't wear them
more than once, so just pick something simple.

687
00:52:54,167 --> 00:52:57,667
It's my last pair of shoes for her,
so I need to pick carefully.

688
00:52:57,667 --> 00:53:00,667
A really pretty pair.

689
00:53:01,800 --> 00:53:04,300
Why are you so heartless?

690
00:53:07,567 --> 00:53:10,400
Ugh, it's driving me crazy.

691
00:53:12,300 --> 00:53:14,967
What's wrong? You're twitching
like a dog that needs to poop.

692
00:53:14,967 --> 00:53:16,100
No!

693
00:53:16,100 --> 00:53:21,200
Don't mention poop or dogs in front of me.

694
00:53:21,200 --> 00:53:22,733
Fine, fine.

695
00:53:22,733 --> 00:53:24,567
You startled me.

696
00:53:24,567 --> 00:53:25,633
Excuse me for a moment.

697
00:53:25,633 --> 00:53:27,433
Huh? What?

698
00:53:28,900 --> 00:53:31,467
Why are they all acting like that?

699
00:53:51,067 --> 00:53:52,833
Wait, wait.

700
00:53:55,233 --> 00:53:59,500
That woman... looks familiar.

701
00:54:00,467 --> 00:54:04,867
Ah, a true beauty is unforgettable
at first sight, right?

702
00:54:04,867 --> 00:54:07,867
How elegant... huh?

703
00:54:07,867 --> 00:54:09,833
Is that the porter?

704
00:54:09,833 --> 00:54:11,167
Porter?

705
00:54:11,167 --> 00:54:13,867
Yes, our lady master...

706
00:54:13,867 --> 00:54:16,100
No, actually...

707
00:54:16,100 --> 00:54:18,833
She's the wench who ruined
Minister Ji Pyeong's household.

708
00:54:18,833 --> 00:54:19,933
I'm certain.

709
00:54:19,933 --> 00:54:21,533
Is that so?

710
00:54:31,200 --> 00:54:32,500
It's been a while.

711
00:54:32,500 --> 00:54:33,533
You are...

712
00:54:33,533 --> 00:54:36,933
Minister Lee requests your presence.

713
00:54:36,933 --> 00:54:38,533
You!

714
00:54:40,533 --> 00:54:43,900
How dare a lowly merchant

715
00:54:43,900 --> 00:54:48,333
wear red silk reserved for nobles.

716
00:54:48,333 --> 00:54:51,100
Do you think you can remain unpunished

717
00:54:51,100 --> 00:54:52,567
after disturbing the moral order?

718
00:54:52,567 --> 00:54:54,067
My deepest apologies.

719
00:54:54,067 --> 00:54:58,067
Give me a moment. I'll change clothes immediately.

720
00:54:58,067 --> 00:55:00,533
Do you think changing clothes

721
00:55:00,533 --> 00:55:04,833
will solve your crime?

722
00:55:04,833 --> 00:55:09,367
I could execute you now

723
00:55:09,367 --> 00:55:11,900
for violating social order.

724
00:55:11,900 --> 00:55:13,333
I've committed a grave sin.

725
00:55:13,333 --> 00:55:16,600
Spare me once, and I'll do anything.

726
00:55:16,600 --> 00:55:18,667
Just spare my life.

727
00:55:21,900 --> 00:55:24,900
Exactly.

728
00:55:25,633 --> 00:55:30,000
'Anything' indeed.

729
00:55:34,933 --> 00:55:38,167
Ah, Minister Lee, what a troublemaker.

730
00:55:39,533 --> 00:55:42,600
Your Highness, Your Highness.

731
00:55:43,600 --> 00:55:44,900
Your Highness, Your Highness.

732
00:55:44,900 --> 00:55:48,033
I told you to guard her. Why are you here?

733
00:55:48,033 --> 00:55:49,733
What? Why? Why? Why?

734
00:55:49,733 --> 00:55:51,200
Just tell me!

735
00:55:51,200 --> 00:55:53,200
Your Highness, urgh!

736
00:56:08,633 --> 00:56:10,967
Ah, poor merchant.

737
00:56:10,967 --> 00:56:12,800
How did she end up caught by the Minister?

738
00:56:12,800 --> 00:56:16,633
I mean, why did she wear red silk
that doesn't match her station?

739
00:56:18,700 --> 00:56:20,333
Merchant in red silk.

740
00:56:20,333 --> 00:56:22,200
Isn't that the porter earlier?

741
00:56:22,200 --> 00:56:23,767
How long have you been following me?

742
00:56:23,767 --> 00:56:26,633
From earlier all along.

743
00:56:26,633 --> 00:56:28,833
Now that you've been spotted, go back.

744
00:56:28,833 --> 00:56:30,667
I have somewhere to be.

745
00:56:34,767 --> 00:56:37,267
Minister Lee is my father's closest ally.

746
00:56:37,267 --> 00:56:40,067
Stop being a thorn in my father's eye.

747
00:56:40,800 --> 00:56:42,400
Let go.

748
00:56:44,333 --> 00:56:48,200
Are you truly planning to form a family
with some lowly porter?

749
00:56:53,700 --> 00:56:55,567
Why not?

750
00:56:55,567 --> 00:56:57,912
I wanted to build a family

751
00:56:57,912 --> 00:56:59,833
with you too.

752
00:57:08,600 --> 00:57:10,233
Huh?

753
00:57:11,767 --> 00:57:14,233
Now come with me.

754
00:57:25,267 --> 00:57:27,667
No, wait. Why here?

755
00:57:27,667 --> 00:57:30,033
Let's go home, okay?

756
00:57:32,133 --> 00:57:34,933
Ah, what madness...

757
00:57:34,933 --> 00:57:38,967
I've torn off the noble's fine clothes.

758
00:57:38,967 --> 00:57:43,300
Do you intend to pick up the sins
I've dropped to the ground and punish me?

759
00:57:43,300 --> 00:57:45,800
How could a Minister of Personnel threaten

760
00:57:45,800 --> 00:57:50,033
and molest a woman against the laws of rank?

761
00:57:50,033 --> 00:57:51,867
Is it right that a man like you

762
00:57:51,867 --> 00:57:55,333
sits high in the court and speaks of governance?

763
00:57:55,333 --> 00:57:57,667
You crazy...

764
00:57:57,667 --> 00:58:01,600
You clearly value your life little!

765
00:58:02,300 --> 00:58:04,500
I'll kill you instantly!

766
00:58:09,467 --> 00:58:11,300
How dare you...

767
00:58:12,167 --> 00:58:14,467
How dare someone like you...

768
00:58:15,433 --> 00:58:16,767
My lord. This is going to get you into trouble.

769
00:58:16,767 --> 00:58:19,467
Sheathe your sword.

770
00:58:27,133 --> 00:58:29,967
Your Highness the Crown Prince.

771
00:58:32,500 --> 00:58:35,333
'Your Highness,' you say?

772
00:58:44,033 --> 00:58:47,033
Step aside. Move.

773
00:58:47,033 --> 00:58:49,867
I don't know where to begin.

774
00:58:49,867 --> 00:58:53,967
How long are you going to keep
running around like a madman?

775
00:58:53,967 --> 00:58:55,933
No, I was just...

776
00:58:55,933 --> 00:58:57,567
Why won't you wait?

777
00:58:57,567 --> 00:59:01,300
When in danger, hurt, or fallen,
you should pause and wait.

778
00:59:01,300 --> 00:59:02,900
You should've cried for help.

779
00:59:02,900 --> 00:59:06,233
You should've waited until I resolved it.

780
00:59:06,233 --> 00:59:08,267
Why should I wait for you...

781
00:59:08,267 --> 00:59:10,167
No...

782
00:59:10,167 --> 00:59:12,120
Why should I

783
00:59:12,120 --> 00:59:14,900
wait for Your Highness?

784
00:59:14,900 --> 00:59:16,728
Why

785
00:59:16,728 --> 00:59:18,367
should Your Highness solve my problem?

786
00:59:18,367 --> 00:59:20,500
This isn't just your problem!

787
00:59:22,067 --> 00:59:24,533
Do you think it's only your problem?

788
00:59:24,533 --> 00:59:28,600
I clearly stated your face resembles my wife's.

789
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:36,200
Is that why you wanted me

790
00:59:37,200 --> 00:59:39,933
to wear that dress?

791
00:59:39,933 --> 00:59:44,133
Did you use that as an excuse
to toy with me and take me for your wife...

792
00:59:44,133 --> 00:59:46,200
no,

793
00:59:46,200 --> 00:59:50,900
Her Highness the Crown Princess?

794
00:59:50,900 --> 00:59:52,533
What?

795
00:59:54,900 --> 00:59:57,100
Will you keep speaking so recklessly?

796
00:59:57,100 --> 00:59:59,667
Isn't that why Your Highness is angry?

797
00:59:59,667 --> 01:00:01,867
This lowborn wretch

798
01:00:03,533 --> 01:00:06,267
should resemble Her Highness the Crown Princess.

799
01:00:06,267 --> 01:00:10,467
Isn't it because I, who resemble your wife,
was being humiliated?

800
01:00:15,067 --> 01:00:16,792
True,

801
01:00:16,792 --> 01:00:18,033
you're correct.

802
01:00:18,033 --> 01:00:21,533
If you get it, don't rush
into danger with that face.

803
01:00:21,533 --> 01:00:24,133
Don't step up, and don't let anyone humiliate you!

804
01:00:29,233 --> 01:00:31,967
I know well you're not my wife.

805
01:00:31,967 --> 01:00:34,200
I'll neither confuse nor waver again.

806
01:00:34,200 --> 01:00:37,467
So take this and never appear before me again.

807
01:00:54,333 --> 01:00:56,400
What are you doing now?

808
01:00:56,400 --> 01:00:58,833
This is mine now, right?

809
01:00:59,533 --> 01:01:01,016
So

810
01:01:01,016 --> 01:01:03,333
I will do as I please.

811
01:01:09,400 --> 01:01:11,100
Stop.

812
01:01:11,100 --> 01:01:12,733
It's an order.

813
01:01:17,567 --> 01:01:20,733
What are you doing now?

814
01:01:20,733 --> 01:01:24,300
How dare you throw away a gift
from His Highness on the ground?

815
01:01:24,300 --> 01:01:27,200
This is treason and impiety.

816
01:01:27,200 --> 01:01:31,467
Will Your Highness leave this traitor unpunished?

817
01:01:31,467 --> 01:01:33,000
Lower your sword.

818
01:01:33,000 --> 01:01:36,567
If you intervene, things will
get worse, Prince Je Woon.

819
01:01:42,933 --> 01:01:44,567
I beg you.

820
01:01:45,900 --> 01:01:47,967
Please stop this.

821
01:01:47,967 --> 01:01:49,877
The bloodshed

822
01:01:49,877 --> 01:01:52,333
is because of you.

823
01:02:36,167 --> 01:02:39,200
Your Highness, Your Highness.

824
01:02:39,200 --> 01:02:40,568
I am wronged.

825
01:02:40,568 --> 01:02:42,904
All this is the Left Minister's fabrication.

826
01:02:42,904 --> 01:02:47,933
The Left Minister sent his daughter
to bring me down. This was his plan.

827
01:02:47,933 --> 01:02:50,533
The Left Minister's daughter...

828
01:02:50,533 --> 01:02:52,280
So

829
01:02:52,280 --> 01:02:54,900
what did that woman say?

830
01:02:54,900 --> 01:02:59,600
She demanded to be Crown Princess
if Prince Je Woon ascends.

831
01:02:59,600 --> 01:03:02,867
She claimed she had attempted
to assassinate Your Highness...

832
01:03:02,867 --> 01:03:06,200
that you would never return.

833
01:03:06,200 --> 01:03:07,800
Did you

834
01:03:07,800 --> 01:03:09,233
tell anyone that?

835
01:03:09,233 --> 01:03:11,467
Never spoke of it in detail.

836
01:03:11,467 --> 01:03:14,000
Then, silence those mouths.

837
01:03:14,000 --> 01:03:17,033
Neither Prince Je Woon
nor the Left Minister's daughter

838
01:03:17,033 --> 01:03:19,167
shall be mentioned again.

839
01:03:24,533 --> 01:03:27,267
If you value your life.

840
01:03:58,767 --> 01:04:00,400
Oh.

841
01:04:01,433 --> 01:04:03,033
My lord.

842
01:04:05,767 --> 01:04:10,600
The neck wound appears shallow,

843
01:04:10,600 --> 01:04:14,567
but the heart's wound runs deep.

844
01:04:18,033 --> 01:04:19,933
I'm fine.

845
01:04:21,300 --> 01:04:25,100
My greed broke the carrier.

846
01:04:25,100 --> 01:04:27,900
I tried carrying more salt than frame could bear.

847
01:04:27,900 --> 01:04:31,333
What frame wouldn't break under such load?

848
01:04:33,267 --> 01:04:37,867
Just some silk robes and embroidered shoes.

849
01:04:37,867 --> 01:04:40,667
What frame couldn't carry that?

850
01:04:44,667 --> 01:04:47,367
Someone must've broken it.

851
01:04:48,167 --> 01:04:49,900
No, it's not.

852
01:04:49,900 --> 01:04:53,000
No wonder my happiness seemed misplaced.

853
01:04:53,000 --> 01:04:56,300
Things like this just weren't meant for me.

854
01:04:56,300 --> 01:04:58,733
Flower shoes? Darn it.

855
01:04:58,733 --> 01:05:01,067
They even hurt my feet.

856
01:05:01,067 --> 01:05:02,656
Then

857
01:05:03,480 --> 01:05:05,633
these should be fine, right?

858
01:05:08,533 --> 01:05:10,767
Oh, I could do it myself.

859
01:05:12,167 --> 01:05:16,033
These straw shoes were hastily
bought on my way here.

860
01:05:16,033 --> 01:05:19,033
It's not that flower shoes don't suit you.

861
01:05:22,600 --> 01:05:26,067
Why did you threaten only the Chief Secretary?

862
01:05:26,067 --> 01:05:28,000
You know the real culprit, right?

863
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:30,300
Because I've figured out the reason.

864
01:05:38,500 --> 01:05:41,167
Just go, all of you.

865
01:05:41,833 --> 01:05:44,667
You're all disloyal subjects.

866
01:05:51,767 --> 01:05:54,267
I shall take my leave now.

867
01:05:54,267 --> 01:05:56,767
My beloved seems injured.

868
01:05:58,700 --> 01:06:01,500
Now there are only those holding blades

869
01:06:01,500 --> 01:06:05,133
at the tips of their fingers or tongues.

870
01:06:32,733 --> 01:06:36,867
<i>Sometimes, a touch</i>

871
01:06:36,867 --> 01:06:40,633
<i>or a glance carries
the truest intention and answer.</i>

872
01:06:43,200 --> 01:06:46,133
My own vengeance also began from affection.

873
01:06:46,133 --> 01:06:50,500
If I crush Prince Je Woon's feelings
for my revenge,

874
01:06:50,500 --> 01:06:53,033
I'll only leave another wound in the heart.

875
01:06:53,033 --> 01:06:54,633
However...

876
01:06:57,733 --> 01:06:59,633
Rather than searching for the Zhen bird,

877
01:06:59,633 --> 01:07:04,300
wouldn't finding evidence that the Left Minister's
daughter tried to assassinate you be faster?

878
01:07:04,300 --> 01:07:07,033
Vengeance is never too late,
no matter how delayed.

879
01:07:07,033 --> 01:07:11,400
Choosing the righteous path
matters more than speed.

880
01:07:15,633 --> 01:07:17,900
But that's a bit too much, isn't it?

881
01:07:23,667 --> 01:07:24,833
Your Highness.

882
01:07:24,833 --> 01:07:28,133
Please calm yourself and return to the palace...

883
01:07:28,133 --> 01:07:32,167
How could such emotions calm so quickly?

884
01:07:32,167 --> 01:07:33,167
Those emotions?

885
01:07:33,167 --> 01:07:34,433
You must feel uneasy.

886
01:07:34,433 --> 01:07:36,167
You were confronted in front of many people...

887
01:07:36,167 --> 01:07:37,367
That's not the feeling.

888
01:07:37,367 --> 01:07:39,200
Yes, it is.

889
01:07:39,200 --> 01:07:41,433
Se Dol, you finally said something
correct after a long time.

890
01:07:41,433 --> 01:07:44,000
Oh, really?

891
01:07:44,000 --> 01:07:46,667
I'm utterly furious now.

892
01:07:46,667 --> 01:07:50,767
If I'm never to see that girl again,

893
01:07:50,767 --> 01:07:54,367
I'll have no way to release
this bitterness, if not now...

894
01:07:54,367 --> 01:07:56,367
That's why I'm going.

895
01:07:56,367 --> 01:07:58,867
To resolve this anger.

896
01:08:03,367 --> 01:08:04,833
Let's go.

897
01:08:04,833 --> 01:08:08,133
First aid is done, so now
we must go for proper treatment.

898
01:08:15,033 --> 01:08:16,833
Change into these clothes.

899
01:08:18,000 --> 01:08:21,467
What? You haven't left yet?

900
01:08:21,467 --> 01:08:24,133
That outfit you're wearing,

901
01:08:24,133 --> 01:08:26,200
that harsh blue clashes with you.

902
01:08:26,200 --> 01:08:28,800
Because you're an autumn leaf type.

903
01:08:28,800 --> 01:08:32,000
Anyway, this color suits
you better. Change quickly.

904
01:08:32,000 --> 01:08:33,867
Did you follow me because of the clothes?

905
01:08:33,867 --> 01:08:35,833
Following you?

906
01:08:35,833 --> 01:08:39,700
I passed by, saw you, stopped,
and then realized...

907
01:08:43,400 --> 01:08:45,067
My feelings.

908
01:08:53,233 --> 01:08:54,833
Alright.

909
01:08:56,900 --> 01:08:58,600
Thank you.

910
01:08:59,400 --> 01:09:01,333
Let's hear what you have to say.

911
01:09:11,433 --> 01:09:12,888
Now,

912
01:09:12,888 --> 01:09:14,267
tell me.

913
01:09:14,267 --> 01:09:16,633
What exactly is that 'feeling'?

914
01:09:21,767 --> 01:09:23,433
Infuriating.

915
01:09:24,600 --> 01:09:27,100
They say the one who caused it
is the one getting mad.

916
01:09:27,100 --> 01:09:29,200
Alright.

917
01:09:29,200 --> 01:09:31,633
Why exactly is Your Highness angry?

918
01:09:31,633 --> 01:09:34,667
I never used you as a puppet
replacing the Crown Princess.

919
01:09:34,667 --> 01:09:36,433
It enrages me to be seen as shameless,

920
01:09:36,433 --> 01:09:39,867
when I'm being misunderstood
for feelings I never had.

921
01:09:40,600 --> 01:09:42,900
That's not it.

922
01:09:42,900 --> 01:09:44,600
In this case,

923
01:09:46,033 --> 01:09:49,067
you should apologize.

924
01:09:49,067 --> 01:09:52,233
Admit your wrongdoing.

925
01:09:52,233 --> 01:09:54,733
You want me, the Crown Prince, to apologize?

926
01:09:54,733 --> 01:09:57,000
Admit fault and beg for forgiveness?

927
01:09:57,000 --> 01:09:59,800
To a mere porter?

928
01:09:59,800 --> 01:10:03,667
If you've done wrong,
apologizing is the right thing to do.

929
01:10:03,667 --> 01:10:08,200
Don't you know stubborn pride
brings more shame than bowed heads?

930
01:10:08,200 --> 01:10:10,808
No people will love

931
01:10:10,808 --> 01:10:13,633
a royal family that does not love the people.

932
01:10:15,167 --> 01:10:18,767
Hence, fear your people.

933
01:10:18,767 --> 01:10:21,067
Love them first.

934
01:10:21,067 --> 01:10:22,712
You rule

935
01:10:22,712 --> 01:10:25,433
not through dominance, but reason.

936
01:10:32,767 --> 01:10:35,033
Since you've nothing more to say,

937
01:10:35,033 --> 01:10:37,267
I'll take my leave.

938
01:10:54,967 --> 01:11:01,167
<i>♫ You flew in like a cloud ♫</i>

939
01:11:03,733 --> 01:11:09,900
<i>♫ Departing like starlight, my beloved ♫</i>

940
01:11:12,533 --> 01:11:17,200
<i>♫ Oh, will my love return to me ♫</i>

941
01:11:17,200 --> 01:11:20,167
Your marriage proposal has been submitted.

942
01:11:20,167 --> 01:11:23,800
In three months, you'll be Crown Princess.

943
01:11:23,800 --> 01:11:31,267
<i>♫ Oh, how futile all becomes ♫</i>

944
01:11:31,267 --> 01:11:33,967
<i>♫ All but a dream ♫</i>

945
01:11:43,500 --> 01:11:44,767
What are you doing now?

946
01:11:44,767 --> 01:11:46,867
What are you...

947
01:11:47,933 --> 01:11:50,333
What on earth are you...

948
01:11:51,633 --> 01:11:56,633
Why do you keep me here
when this is supposed to be our last time?

949
01:11:58,333 --> 01:12:01,400
Why do you root yourself in my heart again!

950
01:12:01,400 --> 01:12:07,033
<i>♫ Oh, will my love return to me ♫</i>

951
01:12:07,033 --> 01:12:15,800
<i>♫ Oh, how futile all becomes ♫</i>

952
01:12:15,800 --> 01:12:20,233
<i>♫ Born of dreams, living and dying in dreams ♫</i>

953
01:12:20,233 --> 01:12:23,433
<i>♫ It's all for naught ♫</i>

954
01:12:24,600 --> 01:12:33,933
<i>♫ What use is dreaming such dreams ♫</i>

955
01:12:33,933 --> 01:12:42,500
<i>♫ Oh dear, oh dear, what a mess ♫</i>

956
01:12:42,500 --> 01:12:51,300
<i>♫ Oh dear, oh dear, what a mess ♫</i>

957
01:12:51,300 --> 01:13:00,133
<i>♫ Oh dear, oh dear, what a mess ♫</i>

958
01:13:00,133 --> 01:13:08,900
<i>♫ Oh dear, oh dear, what a mess ♫</i>

959
01:13:08,900 --> 01:13:17,333
<i>♫ Oh, will my love return to me ♫</i>

960
01:13:17,333 --> 01:13:26,667
<i>♫ Oh, how futile all becomes ♫</i>

961
01:13:27,567 --> 01:13:30,567
<i>♫ All but a dream ♫</i>

962
01:15:21,167 --> 01:15:24,900
<i>When you think about it,
swallows don't only repay kindness.</i>

963
01:15:27,267 --> 01:15:29,533
<i>They give blessings to Heungbu,</i>

964
01:15:29,533 --> 01:15:32,133
<i>and punishment to Nolbu.</i>

965
01:15:32,133 --> 01:15:34,600
<i>They're just shrewd merchants balancing accounts.</i>

966
01:15:34,600 --> 01:15:37,900
<i>That darn swallow must've made a mistake.</i>

967
01:15:37,900 --> 01:15:41,500
<i>No, someone as kind as me
couldn't possibly be Nolbu, right?</i>

968
01:15:41,500 --> 01:15:44,200
<i>- I, the precious Crown Prince...</i>
- Why is this missing?

969
01:15:44,200 --> 01:15:47,600
<i>Switched bodies with this lowly porter...</i>

970
01:15:52,400 --> 01:15:55,000
<i>It's divine punishment!</i>

971
01:16:14,933 --> 01:16:16,800
His Highness has been
acting strange lately, right?

972
01:16:16,800 --> 01:16:22,267
I am Lee Gang Dol, Your Highness.

973
01:16:22,267 --> 01:16:24,333
What exactly is happening?

974
01:16:24,333 --> 01:16:26,833
Why don't we try it like we did that day?

975
01:16:26,833 --> 01:16:28,900
You mean kissing?

976
01:16:28,900 --> 01:16:31,367
If the Left Minister sees that face
resembling the Crown Princess...

977
01:16:31,367 --> 01:16:33,167
Then what would happen?

978
01:16:33,167 --> 01:16:34,967
He'll kill her, of course.
