1
00:00:09,100 --> 00:00:10,370
(All people, incidents, and backgrounds...)

2
00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:11,700
(in this drama are fictitious and unrelated to reality.)

3
00:00:11,770 --> 00:00:13,040
(Also, children and animals were filmed under production guidelines.)

4
00:00:13,240 --> 00:00:14,970
- How can we find her in this crowd?
- What is happening?

5
00:00:15,270 --> 00:00:17,340
- What is everyone gawking at?
- What is that?

6
00:00:17,710 --> 00:00:18,710
What is this?

7
00:00:19,580 --> 00:00:22,380
- Is that not Dal over there?
- That is Dal.

8
00:00:22,410 --> 00:00:24,520
- Why are they dragging her away?
- Oh, my goodness.

9
00:00:24,580 --> 00:00:27,789
- Honey, you stay right here.
- Where are you going?

10
00:00:27,790 --> 00:00:29,050
You are crazy!

11
00:00:30,820 --> 00:00:31,860
Oh, no.

12
00:00:32,760 --> 00:00:34,030
- The mat-rolling punishment?
- Go on.

13
00:00:34,090 --> 00:00:35,159
- Gosh, there is...
- Let us go.

14
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:36,590
Going to be a lot of crying.

15
00:00:36,890 --> 00:00:39,560
The mat-rolling punishment? Oh, dear.

16
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,500
What do we do about our daughter, Dal?

17
00:00:41,870 --> 00:00:42,900
Follow me.

18
00:00:43,270 --> 00:00:46,300
How can you be so cold? If this keeps up,

19
00:00:46,370 --> 00:00:47,870
Dal will be maimed for life.

20
00:00:47,940 --> 00:00:50,910
Even a noble cannot stop a flogging. Only the king himself could.

21
00:00:50,980 --> 00:00:53,010
Yes, I suppose only the king could.

22
00:00:55,110 --> 00:00:56,210
Honey, you are not thinking...

23
00:00:56,980 --> 00:01:00,650
- You cannot be serious.
- The king's son is just as good.

24
00:01:01,020 --> 00:01:02,150
Are you out of your mind?

25
00:01:04,960 --> 00:01:07,790
Who pushed me? Hey, stop pushing.

26
00:01:10,730 --> 00:01:13,630
You think two palace runaways can just approach the Crown Prince?

27
00:01:13,700 --> 00:01:16,500
He entered the palace after we left. How can he recognise us?

28
00:01:17,030 --> 00:01:19,000
Stop worrying and follow me.

29
00:01:19,370 --> 00:01:20,740
Your Royal Highness.

30
00:01:20,970 --> 00:01:23,810
I beg you to save my daughter.

31
00:01:24,510 --> 00:01:25,710
But tell me,

32
00:01:27,010 --> 00:01:28,750
how did you know I am the Crown Prince?

33
00:01:29,650 --> 00:01:32,550
You have an eunuch and a military official.

34
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:33,890
And next to him is...

35
00:01:34,390 --> 00:01:35,450
you, my lord.

36
00:01:35,750 --> 00:01:39,860
Forgive my boldness, Your Highness, but my daughter's life is in danger.

37
00:01:40,460 --> 00:01:42,690
I beg you to show your boundless compassion...

38
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:46,130
and save my daughter, Your Royal Highness.

39
00:01:47,470 --> 00:01:48,730
I am sorry,

40
00:01:49,070 --> 00:01:51,900
but I cannot meddle in the affairs of someone I do not know.

41
00:01:52,070 --> 00:01:53,540
With all due respect,

42
00:01:53,970 --> 00:01:56,910
you do know my daughter, Your Royal Highness.

43
00:01:57,680 --> 00:01:59,810
- I do?
- Yes.

44
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:02,850
The one you were with last night.

45
00:02:03,310 --> 00:02:06,220
The peddler, Park Dal.

46
00:02:08,950 --> 00:02:12,059
- Where is she? Where is the girl?
- You cannot, Your Highness.

47
00:02:12,060 --> 00:02:13,090
If the Left State Councillor finds out...

48
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:14,190
I said, where is she?

49
00:02:17,130 --> 00:02:18,160
Let us go.

50
00:02:18,700 --> 00:02:19,760
Let us go get some rice soup.

51
00:02:51,630 --> 00:02:52,630
Come on.

52
00:02:56,230 --> 00:02:59,170
- What are you doing? Seize them!
- Yes, sir!

53
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:01,710
- Are you ready?
- Goodness!

54
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:04,010
What is the meaning of this outrage?

55
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:06,010
- He interfered with justice.
- Get back!

56
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:09,249
That lord will be responsible for this.

57
00:03:09,250 --> 00:03:10,410
I assure you, he will not be.

58
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:14,020
- My lord.
- My lord.

59
00:03:19,390 --> 00:03:21,730
Goodness, you people.

60
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:23,660
You are mistaken.

61
00:03:24,330 --> 00:03:25,400
I said you are mistaken.

62
00:03:30,170 --> 00:03:31,200
The responsibility...

63
00:03:32,100 --> 00:03:33,800
falls to this lady here.

64
00:03:37,210 --> 00:03:39,679
I misunderstood.

65
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:41,350
That girl is not a thief.

66
00:03:46,950 --> 00:03:48,450
Case closed.

67
00:03:56,760 --> 00:03:58,460
Wait. Please let my hand go and stop.

68
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:05,940
I am sorry.

69
00:04:06,670 --> 00:04:07,770
Did it hurt?

70
00:04:09,210 --> 00:04:10,470
I have to go back.

71
00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:13,810
What do you mean, you have to go back?

72
00:04:13,910 --> 00:04:16,880
This is my problem. I cannot get you involved, my lord.

73
00:04:16,980 --> 00:04:18,980
Do you really think this is just about you?

74
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:23,920
I told you, you look just like my wife.

75
00:04:24,790 --> 00:04:26,259
Was he mat-rolling punishment not enough?

76
00:04:26,260 --> 00:04:28,090
Should I watch you be mutilated too?

77
00:04:28,190 --> 00:04:29,660
Was that degrading spectacle not enough for you?

78
00:04:32,860 --> 00:04:34,200
Degrading spectacle?

79
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,670
Leave Hanyang this instant.

80
00:04:41,170 --> 00:04:44,510
Never set foot in Hanyang again, and stay out of my sight.

81
00:04:44,610 --> 00:04:46,810
This is the price someone as lowly as you...

82
00:04:48,350 --> 00:04:50,010
has to pay for having a face like yours.

83
00:04:54,690 --> 00:04:56,320
And why should I listen to you, my lord?

84
00:04:58,390 --> 00:04:59,390
What?

85
00:05:00,060 --> 00:05:01,930
I am only saying this because I am concerned.

86
00:05:03,730 --> 00:05:04,900
No, you know what?

87
00:05:05,860 --> 00:05:08,000
I am saying this because you have made me feel like dirt.

88
00:05:08,970 --> 00:05:11,300
Please just wake up from your dream already.

89
00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:13,969
I am not your wife from a dream.

90
00:05:13,970 --> 00:05:16,010
I am Park Dal, and I live in reality.

91
00:05:16,270 --> 00:05:19,880
So please stop meddling in my affairs,

92
00:05:20,710 --> 00:05:22,180
and stay out of my sight.

93
00:05:23,350 --> 00:05:27,220
How disgusted do you think your late wife would be...

94
00:05:27,380 --> 00:05:30,390
if she saw you trail me like a pup just for a slight resemblance?

95
00:05:30,690 --> 00:05:34,460
- Watch your mouth.
- Right. Whether I watch it or not,

96
00:05:34,530 --> 00:05:36,290
there will be no more words between us.

97
00:05:36,630 --> 00:05:37,730
Because from now on,

98
00:05:38,330 --> 00:05:39,830
I have no reason to ever see you again.

99
00:05:40,770 --> 00:05:41,900
You do not have to go.

100
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:44,500
- It has been taken care of.
- What are you talking about?

101
00:05:44,570 --> 00:05:45,899
The wife of Inspector Kim,

102
00:05:45,900 --> 00:05:46,969
who lied about the Gate of the Virtuous Woman,

103
00:05:46,970 --> 00:05:49,270
orchestrated this from a grudge.

104
00:05:49,670 --> 00:05:52,480
She will be punished for false accusation, so do not worry.

105
00:05:54,550 --> 00:05:56,050
Now that this is resolved,

106
00:05:57,110 --> 00:05:58,520
leave Hanyang at once.

107
00:06:18,870 --> 00:06:20,270
I am not hurt.

108
00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:22,110
I am just embarrassed.

109
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:24,110
So I do not need your sympathy.

110
00:06:33,380 --> 00:06:34,650
What is there to be embarrassed about?

111
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:41,060
I am embarrassed I got the wrong idea.

112
00:06:43,860 --> 00:06:45,729
Everyone else scorns me and pretends I do not exist...

113
00:06:45,730 --> 00:06:47,360
because of my lowly status.

114
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:51,470
But he walked right up to me,

115
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:54,870
and he even held my hand.

116
00:06:58,240 --> 00:06:59,480
I got my hopes up for nothing.

117
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:02,380
How stupid of me.

118
00:07:10,350 --> 00:07:11,460
Let us just go.

119
00:07:12,090 --> 00:07:15,290
If we stay here, you will just dwell on it.

120
00:07:17,860 --> 00:07:18,860
Where are we going?

121
00:07:19,830 --> 00:07:22,270
"I, Park Dal, Party B," shall repay the debt..."

122
00:07:22,470 --> 00:07:24,500
"to Grand Prince Je Un, Party A,"

123
00:07:24,670 --> 00:07:26,569
"I made for breaking the Western Clock..."

124
00:07:26,570 --> 00:07:28,970
"until my bones turn to dust."

125
00:07:31,810 --> 00:07:35,780
"Party B shall come when summoned and go when Party A dismisses."

126
00:07:35,910 --> 00:07:37,850
"Party A has sole discretion to terminate this contract."

127
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:39,350
What is this?

128
00:07:39,950 --> 00:07:42,920
- This is a slave contract!
- Let us see here.

129
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:45,690
The price of the clock you broke is...

130
00:07:47,060 --> 00:07:48,230
Right.

131
00:07:48,830 --> 00:07:51,930
Park's Inn. If you sell this inn,

132
00:07:52,330 --> 00:07:53,600
I wonder if that would cover the debt.

133
00:07:56,370 --> 00:07:57,740
There, I stamped it.

134
00:08:01,210 --> 00:08:02,410
But there is just one thing.

135
00:08:03,140 --> 00:08:05,810
I cannot stay in Hanyang for very long.

136
00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:10,110
I have an unavoidable and truly tear-jerking sob story.

137
00:08:10,150 --> 00:08:11,850
Why? Because you are a runaway slave?

138
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:14,690
You knew too, Your Highness?

139
00:08:15,850 --> 00:08:17,250
How does everyone know?

140
00:08:18,490 --> 00:08:23,430
Dal lost her parents fleeing slave hunters

141
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:27,260
Were you not the one who sang a song about it for all to hear?

142
00:08:28,070 --> 00:08:30,429
- My big mouth...
- So,

143
00:08:30,430 --> 00:08:32,700
do not think about running away,

144
00:08:32,770 --> 00:08:35,170
and wait in Hanyang until I get back.

145
00:08:35,610 --> 00:08:36,770
You know what will happen if you run, right?

146
00:08:37,140 --> 00:08:38,140
The...

147
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:41,110
Police Bureau.

148
00:08:45,180 --> 00:08:46,780
He is so mean.

149
00:08:48,090 --> 00:08:49,250
Where are you going?

150
00:08:50,890 --> 00:08:52,160
To propose.

151
00:08:55,090 --> 00:08:56,130
Oh, dear.

152
00:08:57,730 --> 00:08:59,000
- My goodness.
- Can you see anything?

153
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:00,860
What am I going to do?

154
00:09:01,100 --> 00:09:02,770
- What am I going to do?
- Come on!

155
00:09:02,900 --> 00:09:05,970
Please just stay still! You are driving me crazy.

156
00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:10,010
Our daughter might be bedridden for the rest of her life,

157
00:09:10,140 --> 00:09:12,310
and you expect me to be still?

158
00:09:12,380 --> 00:09:16,710
Your frantic pacing will not make Dal come home any faster...

159
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:18,920
She is here.

160
00:09:20,680 --> 00:09:21,690
Dal.

161
00:09:22,550 --> 00:09:26,420
My sweet Dal. Are you okay? Are you hurt?

162
00:09:26,520 --> 00:09:28,630
- Oh, my.
- What is wrong?

163
00:09:29,060 --> 00:09:30,790
What? What has gotten into Dad now?

164
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:32,600
What...

165
00:09:33,430 --> 00:09:34,430
Dal...

166
00:09:35,130 --> 00:09:39,600
- Dal!
- What is the matter?

167
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:44,780
We just thought they were going to cut off your legs.

168
00:09:46,380 --> 00:09:48,450
How did you all find out?

169
00:09:49,580 --> 00:09:52,450
I am sorry. Stop crying, everyone. Let us go inside.

170
00:09:52,650 --> 00:09:54,550
- There, there.
- Okay.

171
00:09:55,090 --> 00:09:59,320
- Come on inside.
- Careful.

172
00:09:59,390 --> 00:10:01,490
- Your legs! What happened?
- Sit down.

173
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:02,790
- Right.
- Sit down.

174
00:10:02,930 --> 00:10:05,200
Thank goodness.

175
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:08,630
But hold on a minute.

176
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:12,000
As my parents, you knew everything that was happening,

177
00:10:12,340 --> 00:10:17,010
and you just sat here waiting comfortably?

178
00:10:17,340 --> 00:10:19,009
You should have waited outside if you knew...

179
00:10:19,010 --> 00:10:20,640
and helped me come home.

180
00:10:20,980 --> 00:10:23,080
Unbelievable.

181
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:26,450
I guess I should have come back with my legs chopped off, right?

182
00:10:26,580 --> 00:10:29,750
I should have come back cut down to your size, right?

183
00:10:29,820 --> 00:10:32,360
My bad.

184
00:10:33,190 --> 00:10:34,630
That is because the Crown Prince...

185
00:10:36,730 --> 00:10:38,330
You see...

186
00:10:38,900 --> 00:10:41,730
That nobleman you met yesterday.

187
00:10:42,100 --> 00:10:43,470
He is the one who...

188
00:10:43,730 --> 00:10:47,700
And please do not tell Dal that I am the Crown Prince.

189
00:10:48,210 --> 00:10:49,440
If she finds out who I am,

190
00:10:49,710 --> 00:10:52,140
she will just worry about her rude behaviour toward me...

191
00:10:53,140 --> 00:10:54,550
until she makes herself sick.

192
00:10:55,410 --> 00:10:57,449
He must have thought we were runaway slaves too.

193
00:10:57,450 --> 00:10:59,780
He said to wait somewhere safe.

194
00:10:59,850 --> 00:11:00,979
He said he would be fully responsible...

195
00:11:00,980 --> 00:11:02,590
and bring you back safely.

196
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:04,290
Mom, how do you know that nobleman?

197
00:11:04,890 --> 00:11:07,789
Your mother pleaded with him to save you...

198
00:11:07,790 --> 00:11:09,660
at the risk of her life.

199
00:11:09,830 --> 00:11:10,830
Mom,

200
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:12,800
you pleaded with him?

201
00:11:14,030 --> 00:11:15,200
Gosh.

202
00:11:17,130 --> 00:11:18,570
And I had no idea.

203
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:37,290
That is odd. I was so sure that peddler's father was a eunuch.

204
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:39,660
I just had a gut feeling.

205
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:42,030
I believe this is the 38th time I have had to answer that.

206
00:11:42,430 --> 00:11:44,390
How can a eunuch have a child?

207
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:48,170
Enough. His Royal Highness is already in a foul mood.

208
00:11:48,430 --> 00:11:53,070
Why is His Highness in a foul mood? He is the one who was cruel to her.

209
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:55,740
I can hear every word.

210
00:11:56,010 --> 00:11:59,280
Good. I meant for you to hear me.

211
00:12:01,450 --> 00:12:03,980
- I said, "Stay away." - "Stay away."

212
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:09,190
If Your Highness refuses to see her, the peddler...

213
00:12:09,450 --> 00:12:11,560
would never dare approach you first.

214
00:12:12,620 --> 00:12:13,960
I am afraid I will go to her.

215
00:12:15,160 --> 00:12:16,490
Again and again.

216
00:12:19,160 --> 00:12:21,430
I am afraid I will run to her like a madman.

217
00:12:24,840 --> 00:12:26,900
But now that I have hurt her so badly,

218
00:12:28,540 --> 00:12:30,340
I suppose I cannot go to her now, can I?

219
00:12:55,030 --> 00:12:58,140
Leave Hanyang this instant. This is the price...

220
00:12:58,770 --> 00:13:00,070
someone as lowly as you...

221
00:13:01,370 --> 00:13:02,970
has to pay for having a face like yours.

222
00:13:06,680 --> 00:13:08,050
That vile nobleman.

223
00:13:09,950 --> 00:13:11,110
What was I, some swallow?

224
00:13:11,980 --> 00:13:13,350
Why did he even fix my knee?

225
00:13:18,020 --> 00:13:19,520
Why did he save my legs?

226
00:13:22,930 --> 00:13:25,000
I cannot tell whether he is Nolbu or Heungbu.

227
00:13:30,370 --> 00:13:33,700
(Chapter 3: Heungbu, Nolbu, and Swallow)

228
00:13:33,740 --> 00:13:35,810
(Sinjusa Temple, Yeongdeok)

229
00:13:49,890 --> 00:13:53,690
Even the Left State Councillor is helpless against his own daughter.

230
00:13:54,220 --> 00:13:56,230
Our young lady has quite a temper.

231
00:13:56,460 --> 00:13:58,230
Like father, like daughter.

232
00:13:59,900 --> 00:14:01,100
What did you just say?

233
00:14:03,570 --> 00:14:05,470
Is U Hui the daughter of the Left State Councillor?

234
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:07,900
That cannot be...

235
00:16:11,560 --> 00:16:13,230
Why are you not asking me about it?

236
00:16:14,770 --> 00:16:16,070
Because I think I know.

237
00:16:16,870 --> 00:16:19,670
You knew how much I wanted revenge on the Left State Councillor,

238
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:23,110
so it must have been difficult to reveal you are his daughter.

239
00:16:24,610 --> 00:16:26,710
What a cruel twist of fate.

240
00:16:27,840 --> 00:16:29,580
To play such a wicked game on us.

241
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:35,320
So?

242
00:16:37,520 --> 00:16:39,460
Are you just going to blame the fate?

243
00:16:40,390 --> 00:16:43,129
Will you just blame fate and watch me become...

244
00:16:43,130 --> 00:16:44,260
the Crown Princess?

245
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:46,600
Then...

246
00:16:48,230 --> 00:16:49,500
what do you want me to do?

247
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:54,500
Did you not promise me?

248
00:16:55,770 --> 00:16:57,470
That you would never let go of my hand.

249
00:17:02,080 --> 00:17:03,750
Let us run away. Together.

250
00:17:06,520 --> 00:17:07,849
Do you really think there is anywhere...

251
00:17:07,850 --> 00:17:09,090
my father could not find us?

252
00:17:14,690 --> 00:17:16,430
But more importantly, I refuse.

253
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:20,660
Throwing away everything I have only to fall into ruin...

254
00:17:22,070 --> 00:17:23,330
is not part of my plan.

255
00:17:27,040 --> 00:17:29,540
My father would abandon me if he cannot be the king's in-law.

256
00:17:29,870 --> 00:17:31,480
He is the kind of man who would harm you.

257
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:33,540
So,

258
00:17:34,110 --> 00:17:35,510
you must make a decision.

259
00:17:37,480 --> 00:17:38,480
Are you...

260
00:17:39,550 --> 00:17:41,120
suggesting a coup?

261
00:17:41,180 --> 00:17:43,850
His Majesty's own rise to power was no different from a coup.

262
00:17:44,350 --> 00:17:45,820
Take back your rightful place.

263
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:48,460
My prince.

264
00:17:52,900 --> 00:17:54,260
Do not call me that.

265
00:17:54,300 --> 00:17:55,830
I am the deposed Crown Prince.

266
00:17:55,900 --> 00:17:58,400
If Queen Jangjeong had not been so wrongly accused,

267
00:17:58,600 --> 00:18:00,970
you would never have been deposed.

268
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:03,910
The throne would have been yours.

269
00:18:03,970 --> 00:18:06,080
I have never once wanted the throne.

270
00:18:06,540 --> 00:18:08,040
The only thing I ever wanted...

271
00:18:24,260 --> 00:18:26,330
If not the throne, then choose me.

272
00:18:28,630 --> 00:18:29,800
Have me.

273
00:18:35,670 --> 00:18:36,840
I am so sorry.

274
00:18:45,020 --> 00:18:46,050
After everything,

275
00:18:47,850 --> 00:18:49,350
you are choosing to abandon me?

276
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:09,710
I am sorry.

277
00:19:12,440 --> 00:19:13,740
I am a coward.

278
00:19:50,280 --> 00:19:52,480
- Yeo Ri.
- Yes, my lady.

279
00:19:53,050 --> 00:19:54,650
Summon the palanquin carriers.

280
00:19:55,920 --> 00:19:57,150
Are you going to Hanyang?

281
00:20:02,690 --> 00:20:03,690
Yes, my lady.

282
00:20:35,530 --> 00:20:40,000
Forgive me, sir, but she demands the Crown Prince escort her himself.

283
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:41,870
Okay.

284
00:20:42,700 --> 00:20:43,700
Yes, my lord.

285
00:20:48,540 --> 00:20:49,610
In that case...

286
00:20:51,070 --> 00:20:52,840
Send word to U Hui.

287
00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:55,810
Tell her I will pass on her message to the Crown Prince.

288
00:21:08,760 --> 00:21:10,690
You want me to fetch...

289
00:21:12,660 --> 00:21:13,800
your daughter myself?

290
00:21:14,100 --> 00:21:15,100
Yes, Your Highness.

291
00:21:15,570 --> 00:21:18,000
She is staying at Sinjusa in Yeongdeok.

292
00:21:20,170 --> 00:21:21,840
The journey is not a problem,

293
00:21:22,810 --> 00:21:24,940
but was I not told your daughter was ill...

294
00:21:25,910 --> 00:21:27,680
and is recuperating?

295
00:21:27,880 --> 00:21:30,310
She is not recuperating. She is cultivating her character.

296
00:21:30,710 --> 00:21:33,679
She is staying at a temple, claiming she does not yet have...

297
00:21:33,680 --> 00:21:35,320
wisdom and virtue to be the Crown Princess.

298
00:21:35,420 --> 00:21:38,150
Perhaps Your Royal Highness could tell her she has done enough...

299
00:21:39,620 --> 00:21:41,260
and persuade her to come yourself.

300
00:21:43,430 --> 00:21:47,360
I heard you recently intervened in a flogging.

301
00:21:48,300 --> 00:21:50,799
I think it was the peddler who solved...

302
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:52,970
the fraudulent case of a Gate of the Virtuous Woman.

303
00:21:53,570 --> 00:21:57,070
But that peddler is a woman, correct?

304
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:02,280
Yes. I was on an outing, and she happened to catch my eye.

305
00:22:03,210 --> 00:22:06,020
She looked like she was in trouble, so I helped her.

306
00:22:07,680 --> 00:22:08,790
And why...

307
00:22:10,490 --> 00:22:12,790
did that particular woman catch your eye?

308
00:22:14,620 --> 00:22:19,130
You have not forgotten my advice, have you?

309
00:22:22,370 --> 00:22:25,700
(4 years ago)

310
00:22:26,570 --> 00:22:27,940
This is a sinner's grave.

311
00:22:29,310 --> 00:22:31,570
You must not come here.

312
00:22:32,210 --> 00:22:34,540
I have already lost my mother and my wife.

313
00:22:35,780 --> 00:22:37,450
What more do I have to fear?

314
00:22:38,050 --> 00:22:41,450
Then you must take my advice to heart.

315
00:22:42,150 --> 00:22:43,820
With the exception of my daughter,

316
00:22:43,890 --> 00:22:47,920
any woman you love will die.

317
00:22:50,730 --> 00:22:52,160
Just like this.

318
00:22:54,530 --> 00:22:56,100
How could I possibly forget?

319
00:22:56,800 --> 00:22:59,940
It is always on my mind.

320
00:23:14,180 --> 00:23:15,890
I love this greenhouse.

321
00:23:16,590 --> 00:23:18,820
The name itself, the warmth,

322
00:23:19,560 --> 00:23:21,320
and the memories made here.

323
00:23:22,290 --> 00:23:23,790
They are all so warm.

324
00:24:02,530 --> 00:24:06,400
When my Royal Mother died under false accusations,

325
00:24:06,940 --> 00:24:08,200
Father!

326
00:24:08,470 --> 00:24:12,440
Please clear my mother's name!

327
00:24:13,210 --> 00:24:16,080
Father, I beg of you...

328
00:24:16,710 --> 00:24:19,620
- Please clear my mother's name!
- I prayed...

329
00:24:21,180 --> 00:24:23,520
to everything, seen and unseen.

330
00:24:37,300 --> 00:24:38,500
Mother.

331
00:24:39,070 --> 00:24:40,700
Mother!

332
00:24:47,240 --> 00:24:48,880
The Crown Prince is hereby deposed...

333
00:24:49,910 --> 00:24:51,580
and confined to Sinjusa.

334
00:24:59,790 --> 00:25:00,860
Are you all right, Your Highness?

335
00:25:02,190 --> 00:25:04,660
When no one else was on my side,

336
00:25:04,730 --> 00:25:07,530
when even my family and the skies had abandoned me...

337
00:25:13,540 --> 00:25:15,840
It had to be you, of all people

338
00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:19,640
You, with your ice-cold hands.

339
00:25:20,110 --> 00:25:21,280
Are you okay?

340
00:25:33,590 --> 00:25:34,790
So cold.

341
00:25:36,930 --> 00:25:38,030
Sorry.

342
00:25:38,660 --> 00:25:39,700
Are you all right?

343
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:42,830
Does it hurt?

344
00:25:44,370 --> 00:25:47,140
- I am fine.
- The cold felt good.

345
00:25:47,940 --> 00:25:50,670
Because my heart was burning with anguish.

346
00:25:51,170 --> 00:25:52,640
I am so glad you are okay.

347
00:25:53,110 --> 00:25:54,610
It was then when I realised...

348
00:25:56,250 --> 00:25:57,450
my saviour...

349
00:25:59,050 --> 00:26:00,320
has such cold hands.

350
00:26:03,290 --> 00:26:06,259
But now, you must be his saviour.

351
00:26:06,260 --> 00:26:07,890
Be his whole world.

352
00:26:09,890 --> 00:26:11,190
As you go on with your life,

353
00:26:12,560 --> 00:26:14,000
may you never be cold again.

354
00:26:14,900 --> 00:26:17,400
Neither your hands nor your heart.

355
00:26:19,400 --> 00:26:22,640
But if there is ever a day you cannot help but feel that chill,

356
00:26:22,910 --> 00:26:24,740
come to this greenhouse and rest for a while.

357
00:26:27,140 --> 00:26:30,280
It is entirely yours now.

358
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:41,790
My early congratulations on your Royal Wedding,

359
00:26:44,760 --> 00:26:45,900
Your Highness, the Crown Princess.

360
00:26:48,100 --> 00:26:51,130
(Park Dal)

361
00:26:55,740 --> 00:26:57,310
You can go back to Boryeong now.

362
00:26:57,910 --> 00:27:00,280
You are letting me go, just like that?

363
00:27:00,610 --> 00:27:03,910
Because I have no more use for you.

364
00:27:05,820 --> 00:27:07,380
In fact, if you were to stay here,

365
00:27:08,990 --> 00:27:10,190
you would only complicate things.

366
00:27:11,750 --> 00:27:12,790
You are serious, right?

367
00:27:13,490 --> 00:27:15,530
You promise you will not change your mind later?

368
00:27:15,660 --> 00:27:18,760
In return, you will do one thing for me.

369
00:27:18,900 --> 00:27:20,759
You see, this "favour"...

370
00:27:20,760 --> 00:27:22,470
If it crosses a line, it is a demand,

371
00:27:22,530 --> 00:27:24,269
and then it is basically blackmail.

372
00:27:24,270 --> 00:27:26,240
It all depends on what you ask...

373
00:27:26,300 --> 00:27:27,800
I have not torn up the contract yet.

374
00:27:28,440 --> 00:27:31,239
I just mean my enthusiasm will vary!

375
00:27:31,240 --> 00:27:32,240
I will do my very best, of course.

376
00:27:32,710 --> 00:27:33,710
So, what is it?

377
00:27:37,010 --> 00:27:38,250
Hello, everyone.

378
00:27:39,320 --> 00:27:41,850
- And who might you be?
- You must be new here.

379
00:27:42,150 --> 00:27:46,460
I am Aide Cha of Hanyang Guild, an aide to the Head Merchant.

380
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:48,089
I hear His Majesty granted a guild aide...

381
00:27:48,090 --> 00:27:49,730
an access to the Royal Office of Attire.

382
00:27:49,890 --> 00:27:52,460
Could you be that Cha Eun Woo?

383
00:27:54,260 --> 00:27:55,400
I am.

384
00:27:58,400 --> 00:27:59,470
I am Cha Eun Woo.

385
00:28:02,770 --> 00:28:04,710
- You may enter.
- Thank you.

386
00:28:07,810 --> 00:28:09,350
All right!

387
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:12,320
- Let us go in.
- Yes, sir.

388
00:28:15,220 --> 00:28:18,350
This bracelet is crimson ruby, the very finest of its kind.

389
00:28:18,420 --> 00:28:20,519
It is said to bring its wearer health, wealth, and wisdom.

390
00:28:20,520 --> 00:28:22,990
And it is an object that banishes all fear from one's heart.

391
00:28:23,030 --> 00:28:25,430
It also symbolizes overcoming all danger and adversity.

392
00:28:25,500 --> 00:28:29,170
- It holds such a profound meaning.
- All right, that is enough.

393
00:28:30,100 --> 00:28:33,300
Just prepare the most meaningless and expensive item you have.

394
00:28:33,400 --> 00:28:36,740
Yes, it shall be done. By when should I have it ready?

395
00:28:36,810 --> 00:28:39,440
Have it ready within two hours. We are departing today.

396
00:28:39,510 --> 00:28:41,440
What? You mean right away?

397
00:28:42,780 --> 00:28:44,380
But there is so much we need to prepare.

398
00:28:45,110 --> 00:28:48,020
I will travel light with only 15 of my guards.

399
00:28:48,650 --> 00:28:50,650
- Prepare to depart.
- Yes, Your Royal Highness.

400
00:28:54,890 --> 00:28:55,960
Is it a raspberry?

401
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:07,570
The guards are exhausted.

402
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:09,310
Perhaps we should rest for a moment.

403
00:29:11,840 --> 00:29:13,510
All right, let us do that.

404
00:29:14,180 --> 00:29:17,910
- Find a suitable place to rest.
- Yes, Your Royal Highness.

405
00:29:38,900 --> 00:29:40,100
You are going to Sinjusa?

406
00:29:41,040 --> 00:29:42,040
Why?

407
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:45,779
This errand is a secret.

408
00:29:45,780 --> 00:29:47,440
You must not tell anyone.

409
00:29:47,610 --> 00:29:51,480
Why? Is it a love letter to your sweetheart or something?

410
00:29:57,450 --> 00:29:58,550
All right, I get it.

411
00:30:02,730 --> 00:30:03,790
It is a secret.

412
00:30:04,330 --> 00:30:06,830
So where are you off to, my lord?

413
00:30:08,060 --> 00:30:09,200
Mine is a secret as well.

414
00:30:11,930 --> 00:30:15,970
How disgusted do you think your late wife would be...

415
00:30:16,140 --> 00:30:19,240
if she saw you trail me like a pup just for a slight resemblance?

416
00:30:21,810 --> 00:30:22,850
Well...

417
00:30:23,950 --> 00:30:25,750
You see...

418
00:30:26,620 --> 00:30:27,950
The other day...

419
00:30:29,850 --> 00:30:30,990
When I was given the mat-rolling punishment...

420
00:30:32,690 --> 00:30:34,489
If you are going to Sinjusa,

421
00:30:34,490 --> 00:30:36,660
- shall we go together?
- What?

422
00:30:37,260 --> 00:30:40,160
You are going to Sinjusa too? What for?

423
00:30:40,330 --> 00:30:42,270
He is going to escort his betrothed.

424
00:30:47,140 --> 00:30:48,140
I see...

425
00:30:49,140 --> 00:30:51,540
So you have a fiancee.

426
00:30:52,780 --> 00:30:54,440
Well, no...

427
00:30:55,340 --> 00:30:58,780
- I mean, it is...
- I just have to go get my pack.

428
00:31:06,490 --> 00:31:10,260
Why not just post a notice that the Crown Prince is a pushover?

429
00:31:11,260 --> 00:31:12,300
What for?

430
00:31:12,660 --> 00:31:15,360
- Everyone in the capital knows.
- Why, you little...

431
00:31:18,100 --> 00:31:19,240
Darn it!

432
00:31:20,370 --> 00:31:22,610
Will you be travelling with that peddler?

433
00:31:22,810 --> 00:31:24,170
Well, there is only one path,

434
00:31:24,270 --> 00:31:26,110
so we will have no choice but to travel together.

435
00:31:33,050 --> 00:31:35,520
Speaking of which...

436
00:31:35,580 --> 00:31:39,260
I have told the guards not to reveal your identity, Your Royal Highness.

437
00:31:39,320 --> 00:31:41,659
How did you know I would say that?

438
00:31:41,660 --> 00:31:42,690
Previously,

439
00:31:43,190 --> 00:31:47,130
you were concerned about that peddler learning your true identity.

440
00:31:49,730 --> 00:31:52,970
Thank you. That punk could learn from your example.

441
00:31:54,900 --> 00:31:55,910
Your Royal Highness.

442
00:31:56,670 --> 00:32:00,210
Please do not forget the purpose of this journey.

443
00:32:10,590 --> 00:32:11,590
My lady.

444
00:32:22,430 --> 00:32:23,500
A little nod?

445
00:32:24,430 --> 00:32:26,270
She will not even come out and give me just a little nod?

446
00:32:28,400 --> 00:32:31,239
Such a beauty does not need to move.

447
00:32:31,240 --> 00:32:32,780
The men go to her.

448
00:32:34,510 --> 00:32:36,110
You really hit the jackpot, Secret Royal Inspector.

449
00:32:36,450 --> 00:32:38,009
Lucky that stunning beauty is your fiance.

450
00:32:38,010 --> 00:32:39,320
A stunning beauty?

451
00:32:39,750 --> 00:32:41,150
You are much prettier.

452
00:32:54,200 --> 00:32:57,500
Goodness, fancy seeing a Buddha statue here.

453
00:32:59,170 --> 00:33:00,900
Where else would a Buddha statue be, if not in a temple?

454
00:33:01,700 --> 00:33:02,710
Where else?

455
00:33:03,340 --> 00:33:04,710
Why did he suddenly say that?

456
00:33:05,470 --> 00:33:06,480
That really startled me.

457
00:33:09,040 --> 00:33:11,410
I guess a lot of noble young ladies come here.

458
00:33:11,750 --> 00:33:13,620
I hear the Left State Councillor's daughter is here too.

459
00:33:13,720 --> 00:33:15,050
She is the Left State Councillor's daughter.

460
00:33:16,620 --> 00:33:19,920
I see. I guess all the daughters of the Left State Councillor are here.

461
00:33:20,390 --> 00:33:21,420
Daughters?

462
00:33:21,760 --> 00:33:24,089
He has no other children. She is an only child.

463
00:33:24,090 --> 00:33:25,190
That is her over there.

464
00:33:45,280 --> 00:33:47,750
Your prayer must be quite fervent,

465
00:33:48,080 --> 00:33:50,120
seeing as you will not even rise to greet me.

466
00:33:50,420 --> 00:33:53,620
Yes, because this prayer must be answered.

467
00:33:54,460 --> 00:33:55,960
If you have something to say to me,

468
00:33:56,460 --> 00:33:58,590
let us meet at the edge of the cliff in two hours.

469
00:33:59,760 --> 00:34:00,900
Goodness.

470
00:34:01,360 --> 00:34:03,530
The edge of the cliff, of all places.

471
00:34:05,100 --> 00:34:06,100
And why is that?

472
00:34:07,140 --> 00:34:08,800
Are you planning to push me off?

473
00:34:09,540 --> 00:34:11,510
I would not do something so foolish.

474
00:34:11,910 --> 00:34:14,240
The view up there is magnificent.

475
00:34:14,440 --> 00:34:15,980
Since you have come all this way,

476
00:34:16,510 --> 00:34:18,510
you might as well enjoy the view.

477
00:34:24,590 --> 00:34:26,360
Are you a good person?

478
00:34:32,430 --> 00:34:33,729
How do I seem to you?

479
00:34:33,730 --> 00:34:35,000
Does it sound like a simple question?

480
00:34:36,270 --> 00:34:37,830
I am a bad person.

481
00:34:44,010 --> 00:34:45,040
That is a relief.

482
00:34:45,670 --> 00:34:49,080
I would have felt uneasy if you were a good person.

483
00:34:57,290 --> 00:34:58,650
I am also relieved...

484
00:34:59,990 --> 00:35:01,260
that I am a bad person.

485
00:35:05,860 --> 00:35:07,200
Carry on.

486
00:35:13,300 --> 00:35:14,300
Oh, right.

487
00:35:16,840 --> 00:35:18,510
But do not pray too hard.

488
00:35:19,070 --> 00:35:22,810
Buddha usually ignores the prayers of bad people.

489
00:35:36,790 --> 00:35:37,790
What is it now...

490
00:35:39,430 --> 00:35:40,460
Who are you?

491
00:35:41,100 --> 00:35:43,400
Grand Prince Je Un sent me.

492
00:35:46,540 --> 00:35:48,300
You are the daughter of the Left State Councillor, right?

493
00:35:50,510 --> 00:35:52,980
Grand Prince Je Un asked me to give you this.

494
00:36:24,970 --> 00:36:26,180
Well...

495
00:36:26,510 --> 00:36:29,710
The wind is fierce because we are in the mountains.

496
00:36:32,210 --> 00:36:33,680
It is making my eyes water too.

497
00:36:38,790 --> 00:36:40,160
I will be on my way now.

498
00:36:41,590 --> 00:36:42,660
Stop.

499
00:36:47,860 --> 00:36:49,730
Go straight down the mountain right away.

500
00:36:50,030 --> 00:36:52,130
What? But the sun has already set.

501
00:36:53,040 --> 00:36:54,040
Go.

502
00:36:54,570 --> 00:36:55,600
This is for your trouble.

503
00:36:56,010 --> 00:36:57,970
- But...
- Go.

504
00:36:59,980 --> 00:37:00,980
Okay.

505
00:37:14,220 --> 00:37:16,530
You are back, Your Royal Highness. Come, have something to eat.

506
00:37:17,030 --> 00:37:18,030
Goodness.

507
00:37:18,590 --> 00:37:22,130
- Goodness.
- Good grief. Honestly.

508
00:37:22,460 --> 00:37:26,170
What did I tell you, you idiot? Did you have to eat every raspberry?

509
00:37:26,540 --> 00:37:31,140
And you just swallowed them whole. Of course your stomach is a mess.

510
00:37:34,210 --> 00:37:37,610
Why is a eunuch so obsessed with things that are meant for men?

511
00:37:37,780 --> 00:37:39,150
I am asking because I genuinely do not get it.

512
00:37:40,880 --> 00:37:42,320
Eunuchs are men too!

513
00:37:43,990 --> 00:37:45,050
Look at him.

514
00:37:46,360 --> 00:37:47,890
That was an insensitive remark.

515
00:37:49,290 --> 00:37:52,560
What? Why? It is not like I was wrong.

516
00:37:53,260 --> 00:37:55,300
Just because something is true does not make it right to say.

517
00:37:55,430 --> 00:37:57,270
Your father was my master.

518
00:37:57,570 --> 00:38:00,300
- Not you.
- It is what my father taught me.

519
00:38:03,570 --> 00:38:05,970
Oh, my, has it been two hours already?

520
00:38:06,740 --> 00:38:08,240
I think I will go for a walk.

521
00:38:09,280 --> 00:38:11,149
All of you, eat and get some rest.

522
00:38:11,150 --> 00:38:12,310
- Yes, Your Highness.
- Yes, Your Highness.

523
00:38:22,620 --> 00:38:25,290
Where on earth is that man? I cannot find him anywhere.

524
00:38:27,530 --> 00:38:28,560
My lord!

525
00:38:30,070 --> 00:38:31,930
Excuse me, have you seen the Secret Royal Inspector?

526
00:38:32,770 --> 00:38:33,770
Over there.

527
00:38:42,380 --> 00:38:43,750
What did you just say?

528
00:38:44,010 --> 00:38:45,250
I said I will not do it.

529
00:38:45,810 --> 00:38:49,650
- This Royal Wedding.
- You do not grasp its importance.

530
00:38:50,290 --> 00:38:52,049
The Royal Wedding is not about us.

531
00:38:52,050 --> 00:38:53,820
The Left State Council wants to be the king's in-law,

532
00:38:54,020 --> 00:38:56,960
and I want his power. That...

533
00:38:57,760 --> 00:38:59,260
is the reason for this Royal Wedding.

534
00:39:01,930 --> 00:39:03,770
And because my heart has no place in it,

535
00:39:04,300 --> 00:39:06,300
I am refusing this marriage.

536
00:39:06,370 --> 00:39:08,439
Do you think my heart has a place in it?

537
00:39:08,440 --> 00:39:09,640
Then, you should...

538
00:39:10,070 --> 00:39:11,740
call this Royal Wedding off, Your Royal Highness.

539
00:39:16,180 --> 00:39:18,310
Then how about this?

540
00:39:24,020 --> 00:39:26,660
What if I were to truly fall in love with you?

541
00:39:27,260 --> 00:39:28,720
Because every woman I have ever loved...

542
00:39:29,760 --> 00:39:30,790
has ended up dead.

543
00:39:34,200 --> 00:39:35,200
And who was it...

544
00:39:36,700 --> 00:39:38,100
that killed them?

545
00:39:47,780 --> 00:39:51,050
Gosh. How cringey.

546
00:39:54,120 --> 00:39:56,690
I will be on my way now.

547
00:39:57,290 --> 00:39:58,689
Tell the inspector not to worry.

548
00:39:58,690 --> 00:40:01,220
I will never be returning to Hanyang.

549
00:40:02,460 --> 00:40:03,690
You take care as well, my lord.

550
00:40:08,730 --> 00:40:11,000
He already has a bride to carry in a fancy palanquin,

551
00:40:11,230 --> 00:40:12,870
so why did he have to be so sweet to me?

552
00:40:14,140 --> 00:40:15,140
Why did he confuse me?

553
00:40:17,010 --> 00:40:18,240
Do you have any idea...

554
00:40:20,680 --> 00:40:22,640
what you are implying?

555
00:40:23,210 --> 00:40:25,250
We both know exactly what I mean, do we not, Your Royal Highness?

556
00:40:26,350 --> 00:40:29,950
Is that not why you want to make me your royal consort?

557
00:40:30,590 --> 00:40:32,690
To get your revenge on my father.

558
00:40:33,560 --> 00:40:35,960
I am sorry, but I have no intention of playing along.

559
00:40:36,190 --> 00:40:39,290
I am sick of being used as a pawn in someone else's game.

560
00:40:39,960 --> 00:40:40,960
In fact,

561
00:40:42,360 --> 00:40:43,670
I am not sorry at all.

562
00:40:47,100 --> 00:40:50,070
I have made my intentions clear. Now, if you will excuse me.

563
00:40:50,470 --> 00:40:52,310
You must be weary from your journey.

564
00:40:55,080 --> 00:40:56,810
May you sleep for a very long time.

565
00:41:44,060 --> 00:41:47,030
I hope the tiger at least leaves one of my arms.

566
00:41:48,130 --> 00:41:50,930
A tiger has to eat me and leave a part of me behind.

567
00:41:51,330 --> 00:41:52,669
Then she will realise and think,

568
00:41:52,670 --> 00:41:54,740
"Gosh, an innocent peddler's death is on me."

569
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:57,240
And she will shed tears of repentance.

570
00:41:58,110 --> 00:41:59,170
Anyway,

571
00:41:59,910 --> 00:42:03,280
Does the inspector know about this whole sordid affair or not?

572
00:42:08,580 --> 00:42:09,580
Still,

573
00:42:10,090 --> 00:42:11,550
maybe I should have said goodbye before I left.

574
00:42:13,220 --> 00:42:15,720
I never thanked him for saving me.

575
00:42:17,390 --> 00:42:18,660
She is gone?

576
00:42:18,760 --> 00:42:21,230
Yes. She said she will not be going to Hanyang...

577
00:42:21,460 --> 00:42:23,130
and asked me to tell you not to worry.

578
00:42:23,300 --> 00:42:25,430
How can I not worry?

579
00:42:25,530 --> 00:42:28,300
She may be a peddler who knows every river and mountain trail,

580
00:42:28,340 --> 00:42:29,910
but the terrain here is treacherous.

581
00:42:30,540 --> 00:42:31,740
So reckless, going off on her own.

582
00:42:32,210 --> 00:42:34,480
Wait a minute. Where did she go?

583
00:42:52,560 --> 00:42:53,860
Who sent you?

584
00:42:54,400 --> 00:42:58,000
I will hold them off somehow. You must escape with the lady.

585
00:42:58,170 --> 00:43:01,540
Do not act tough. How can you take them all on alone?

586
00:43:03,270 --> 00:43:04,370
Save me.

587
00:43:04,740 --> 00:43:06,680
Did you not just say you wanted me dead?

588
00:43:07,280 --> 00:43:09,540
For you to kill me, I have to be alive.

589
00:43:13,820 --> 00:43:15,120
Your Royal Highness, hurry!

590
00:43:21,960 --> 00:43:24,360
Just hold on. I will be back for you.

591
00:43:49,120 --> 00:43:51,050
Do not come out of here, no matter what.

592
00:43:51,490 --> 00:43:52,620
And do not make a single sound.

593
00:44:03,330 --> 00:44:05,270
You think this is a laughing matter?

594
00:44:05,470 --> 00:44:06,940
Is it not ironic?

595
00:44:07,270 --> 00:44:09,570
The man who just threatened to kill me...

596
00:44:10,010 --> 00:44:11,410
is now trying to save my life.

597
00:44:13,710 --> 00:44:16,550
Like you said, you need to be alive, so I can be the one to kill you...

598
00:44:16,980 --> 00:44:18,350
whether it is for tomorrow or a year.

599
00:44:19,380 --> 00:44:20,520
So for today, you should live.

600
00:44:58,390 --> 00:44:59,390
Oh Shin Won!

601
00:45:04,090 --> 00:45:05,330
Yes, Your Royal Highness!

602
00:45:57,550 --> 00:45:58,580
Left Flank Guard Oh Shin Won!

603
00:45:59,550 --> 00:46:02,550
- Yes, Your Royal Highness.
- From now on,

604
00:46:03,690 --> 00:46:04,720
we run for our lives.

605
00:46:04,990 --> 00:46:05,990
Run?

606
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:18,530
The beacon mound is just a little further.

607
00:46:18,700 --> 00:46:19,899
- Hang in there.
- Yes.

608
00:46:19,900 --> 00:46:21,770
- That way!
- Yes, sir!

609
00:46:23,210 --> 00:46:24,210
Come on.

610
00:46:43,760 --> 00:46:46,130
Did they anticipate we would come to the beacon mound?

611
00:46:46,490 --> 00:46:47,830
We have to light the beacon.

612
00:46:48,160 --> 00:46:49,200
This is exactly why...

613
00:46:50,370 --> 00:46:52,430
a proper education is so important.

614
00:47:04,750 --> 00:47:06,980
The people's hard-earned taxes finally paid off.

615
00:47:07,180 --> 00:47:08,680
You have been spending too much time with Yoon Se Dol.

616
00:47:22,500 --> 00:47:25,930
A cold dread. A dagger pierces my heart.

617
00:47:26,430 --> 00:47:28,170
It is my back that is going to get it, not your heart.

618
00:48:31,470 --> 00:48:32,500
Your Royal Highness!

619
00:49:08,570 --> 00:49:11,469
Please stop travelling light with minimum guards.

620
00:49:11,470 --> 00:49:12,670
I cannot take this.

621
00:49:12,740 --> 00:49:14,440
Hardship builds character.

622
00:49:14,780 --> 00:49:16,780
Any more growth, and it will just be old age.

623
00:49:55,050 --> 00:49:56,050
Shin Won.

624
00:50:04,560 --> 00:50:05,890
Shin Won...

625
00:50:06,860 --> 00:50:08,900
- Your Royal Highness.
- No.

626
00:50:09,160 --> 00:50:10,470
No, Shin Won.

627
00:50:10,930 --> 00:50:13,970
You cannot die like this. You cannot die, Shin Won.

628
00:50:18,140 --> 00:50:19,140
All right.

629
00:50:21,340 --> 00:50:22,410
You must be tired.

630
00:50:24,680 --> 00:50:26,280
Just close your eyes for a bit.

631
00:50:27,750 --> 00:50:31,190
I will carry you out of here.

632
00:51:51,770 --> 00:51:54,100
Your Royal Highness!

633
00:51:55,600 --> 00:51:56,800
Left Flank Guard.

634
00:51:57,470 --> 00:51:59,810
Left Flank Guard!

635
00:52:00,540 --> 00:52:03,480
Left Flank Guard, please open your eyes.

636
00:52:05,350 --> 00:52:06,810
Gosh, you scared me half to death!

637
00:52:08,680 --> 00:52:10,450
Left Flank Guard...

638
00:52:11,020 --> 00:52:14,520
- Your Royal Highness...
- Thank goodness, Left Flank Guard.

639
00:52:14,590 --> 00:52:15,620
Your Royal Highness.

640
00:52:16,290 --> 00:52:17,390
Your Royal Highness.

641
00:52:18,230 --> 00:52:20,600
His Highness? Why are you looking for him over there?

642
00:52:21,200 --> 00:52:23,100
His Royal Highness was shot.

643
00:52:25,130 --> 00:52:26,200
Your Royal Highness.

644
00:52:35,610 --> 00:52:36,610
Left Flank Guard.

645
00:52:37,150 --> 00:52:38,150
This...

646
00:52:39,410 --> 00:52:41,520
Wait... It cannot be, right?

647
00:52:42,720 --> 00:52:43,720
Left Flank Guard.

648
00:52:44,690 --> 00:52:45,790
Tell me I am wrong.

649
00:52:58,500 --> 00:53:00,100
Your Royal Highness!

650
00:53:03,470 --> 00:53:05,470
Your Royal Highness!

651
00:53:08,680 --> 00:53:09,710
Your Majesty.

652
00:53:10,110 --> 00:53:13,280
The Left State Councillor's daughter has testified...

653
00:53:13,410 --> 00:53:15,580
that she saw His Highness fall from the cliff herself.

654
00:53:16,150 --> 00:53:19,120
Therefore, I am afraid waiting for His Royal Highness any longer is...

655
00:53:19,190 --> 00:53:20,619
Do not tell me...

656
00:53:20,620 --> 00:53:22,089
you are going to say you want to make...

657
00:53:22,090 --> 00:53:23,490
Grand Prince Je Un as Crown Prince.

658
00:53:24,830 --> 00:53:25,890
Will you?

659
00:53:25,990 --> 00:53:27,399
Do not insult my loyalty...

660
00:53:27,400 --> 00:53:29,100
to the Royal Ancestral Shrine and the State Altars.

661
00:53:29,800 --> 00:53:34,040
And given the situation, do we have any choice but Grand Prince Je Un?

662
00:53:34,270 --> 00:53:36,870
His Majesty is barely over 40 years of age.

663
00:53:37,470 --> 00:53:39,670
He only needs to hold a Royal Wedding.

664
00:53:42,540 --> 00:53:46,210
Unbelievable. Before His Majesty, who has just lost his son,

665
00:53:46,410 --> 00:53:49,650
you dare bring up a Royal Wedding? How utterly shameless.

666
00:53:49,780 --> 00:53:51,919
Hey! Show some respect!

667
00:53:51,920 --> 00:53:54,690
What? Shameless? The nerve!

668
00:53:54,920 --> 00:53:57,630
What? How dare you say that!

669
00:53:58,430 --> 00:53:59,430
Enough!

670
00:54:01,860 --> 00:54:04,230
How can you, the ministers of this nation,

671
00:54:04,870 --> 00:54:06,870
be so blind to the king's suffering?

672
00:54:07,540 --> 00:54:09,470
My apologies, Left State Councillor.

673
00:54:40,570 --> 00:54:41,870
Gosh, a boat!

674
00:54:42,400 --> 00:54:44,570
Heave-ho.

675
00:55:35,260 --> 00:55:36,960
What in the world? It looks like a dead body.

676
00:55:37,830 --> 00:55:40,390
Oh, my goodness! It is a dead body, is it not?

677
00:55:41,200 --> 00:55:43,659
So a tiger really did make it out this far!

678
00:55:43,660 --> 00:55:44,670
Gosh!

679
00:55:45,770 --> 00:55:49,870
But a tiger would leave only bones. Why is he in one piece?

680
00:55:50,240 --> 00:55:52,440
Oh, dear.

681
00:56:09,760 --> 00:56:10,760
My lord?

682
00:56:11,590 --> 00:56:14,230
My lord! Wake up!

683
00:56:16,260 --> 00:56:17,270
What is this?

684
00:56:18,200 --> 00:56:19,400
Goodness.

685
00:56:20,370 --> 00:56:22,470
He came to marry the Left State Councillor's daughter,

686
00:56:22,900 --> 00:56:24,870
so why on earth would he get shot?

687
00:56:25,810 --> 00:56:27,140
Oh, my gosh!

688
00:56:29,280 --> 00:56:32,180
Have you seen this man? He must have been shot in the chest.

689
00:56:33,380 --> 00:56:34,380
Oh, no.

690
00:56:39,090 --> 00:56:40,290
I cannot say that I have.

691
00:56:40,490 --> 00:56:44,090
If you see him, you must report it to the authorities. Be sure to.

692
00:56:44,160 --> 00:56:46,789
- All right. You two take care now.
- Let us check over there.

693
00:56:46,790 --> 00:56:49,800
- Over there.
- He is not there? Search properly!

694
00:56:49,960 --> 00:56:52,070
- Yes, sir!
- Did he commit a crime?

695
00:56:54,940 --> 00:56:56,540
If the authorities know he has been shot,

696
00:56:56,770 --> 00:56:58,210
they will search all the clinics first.

697
00:57:00,340 --> 00:57:02,680
But if I do not take him, he will die right here.

698
00:57:04,680 --> 00:57:07,619
Still, this is better than being caught...

699
00:57:07,620 --> 00:57:09,050
and dying without treatment.

700
00:57:10,220 --> 00:57:11,550
Okay. That is settled.

701
00:57:18,260 --> 00:57:19,260
Goodness.

702
00:57:34,810 --> 00:57:36,010
Oh, my!

703
00:57:36,610 --> 00:57:40,680
Oh, no! Why will it not stop?

704
00:57:42,520 --> 00:57:45,350
Goodness! What do I do?

705
00:57:45,850 --> 00:57:46,990
Wait.

706
00:57:48,820 --> 00:57:51,290
Why does the bleeding not stop?

707
00:57:51,790 --> 00:57:52,930
Oh, dear.

708
00:57:54,300 --> 00:57:55,400
Hang on.

709
00:57:57,330 --> 00:57:58,530
Just hang in there.

710
00:57:59,100 --> 00:58:00,200
There.

711
00:58:10,140 --> 00:58:12,480
Goodness. Wait.

712
00:58:15,280 --> 00:58:16,380
I am sorry, my lord.

713
00:58:32,630 --> 00:58:33,670
I am so sorry!

714
00:59:21,180 --> 00:59:24,249
If Grand Prince Je Un actually becomes the Crown Prince,

715
00:59:24,250 --> 00:59:25,550
will that not be a disaster for us?

716
00:59:25,720 --> 00:59:30,220
If we force the Royal Wedding now, His Majesty would take his own life.

717
00:59:30,360 --> 00:59:31,390
Left State Councillor.

718
00:59:31,730 --> 00:59:33,530
Relying on Grand Prince Je Un as a second choice...

719
00:59:33,830 --> 00:59:35,130
is far too risky.

720
00:59:35,300 --> 00:59:37,630
The reason we could manipulate His Majesty so far...

721
00:59:38,170 --> 00:59:40,770
was because of his weakness, the Crown Prince.

722
00:59:41,340 --> 00:59:43,700
Now, His Majesty no longer has that weakness.

723
00:59:44,010 --> 00:59:46,409
Are you saying we should do nothing?

724
00:59:46,410 --> 00:59:47,840
If the Crown Prince is dead,

725
00:59:48,010 --> 00:59:51,210
it is natural that Grand Prince Je Un will ascend the throne.

726
00:59:51,850 --> 00:59:53,110
And did His Majesty...

727
00:59:53,780 --> 00:59:56,480
ascend the throne simply because it was his turn?

728
00:59:56,750 --> 00:59:57,920
You mean to say...

729
00:59:58,250 --> 01:00:00,120
Are you saying...

730
01:00:00,720 --> 01:00:02,890
that you are going to kill Grand Prince Je Un?

731
01:00:16,040 --> 01:00:18,640
Father. It is I, U Hui.

732
01:00:21,510 --> 01:00:23,040
What did you just say?

733
01:00:23,340 --> 01:00:25,180
I killed the Crown Prince.

734
01:00:26,180 --> 01:00:28,080
I did it to make Grand Prince Je Un the Crown Prince...

735
01:00:28,680 --> 01:00:30,220
and to take my place by his side.

736
01:00:32,190 --> 01:00:33,350
Do not tell me...

737
01:00:33,620 --> 01:00:36,960
- Yes. He is the man I love.
- How dare you...

738
01:00:37,320 --> 01:00:38,860
defy my will...

739
01:00:39,960 --> 01:00:41,430
and shatter my ambition?

740
01:00:42,160 --> 01:00:46,000
Do you know how hard I have worked to become the king's in-law?

741
01:00:47,600 --> 01:00:50,000
How could you do this to me knowing that?

742
01:00:50,240 --> 01:00:52,410
I am not defying your will, Father.

743
01:00:53,810 --> 01:00:55,610
I will make Grand Prince Je Un the Crown Prince,

744
01:00:55,880 --> 01:00:57,340
and I will become his Crown Princess.

745
01:00:57,880 --> 01:01:00,150
And in time, I will become this nation's queen.

746
01:01:00,710 --> 01:01:01,750
Then naturally,

747
01:01:02,350 --> 01:01:03,680
you will become the king's in-law.

748
01:01:04,190 --> 01:01:07,020
Who gave you permission to think?

749
01:01:07,660 --> 01:01:09,560
I decided it for myself.

750
01:01:10,290 --> 01:01:12,230
You need to understand something from now on.

751
01:01:12,560 --> 01:01:14,630
I am not your tool.

752
01:01:15,600 --> 01:01:17,670
You are mine.

753
01:01:19,470 --> 01:01:22,140
You may have put His Majesty on the throne,

754
01:01:22,670 --> 01:01:23,770
but the next king...

755
01:01:24,670 --> 01:01:25,910
and the king after that...

756
01:01:27,510 --> 01:01:28,710
I will be the one to choose them.

757
01:01:32,050 --> 01:01:34,780
Whether this is an act of treason or a triumph...

758
01:01:36,780 --> 01:01:38,120
is in my hands.

759
01:02:03,740 --> 01:02:04,780
You are awake?

760
01:02:28,600 --> 01:02:30,470
You, before my very eyes...

761
01:02:31,910 --> 01:02:33,710
Are you a dream? Or a spirit?

762
01:02:53,690 --> 01:02:55,260
Dream or spirit.

763
01:02:57,970 --> 01:03:01,500
I do not care if I am dead and this is the fiery pit.

764
01:03:03,170 --> 01:03:05,240
I wanted to see you, even if it is just like this.

765
01:03:07,940 --> 01:03:09,180
My dear Yeon Wol.

766
01:03:25,490 --> 01:03:26,560
You still seem...

767
01:03:28,330 --> 01:03:31,670
a little delirious.

768
01:03:33,130 --> 01:03:35,470
You did take a bullet.

769
01:03:35,940 --> 01:03:37,100
So it is understandable.

770
01:03:58,260 --> 01:03:59,790
Did you save my life?

771
01:04:02,200 --> 01:04:03,200
Well done.

772
01:04:05,030 --> 01:04:06,600
"Well done?" Is that all you can say?

773
01:04:07,900 --> 01:04:10,239
I nursed you constantly for 15 days.

774
01:04:10,240 --> 01:04:12,070
Good grief, I nearly died myself.

775
01:04:12,140 --> 01:04:13,140
What?

776
01:04:13,910 --> 01:04:14,980
Fifteen days?

777
01:04:16,180 --> 01:04:17,240
Pretty impressive, right?

778
01:04:17,710 --> 01:04:19,110
I must get to Hanyang at once.

779
01:04:20,080 --> 01:04:21,350
Bring me a horse.

780
01:04:21,920 --> 01:04:25,420
- I will reward you handsomely.
- We are in Yeongdeok. Hello?

781
01:04:25,790 --> 01:04:27,760
All the way to Hanyang from here on horseback?

782
01:04:28,090 --> 01:04:29,090
In your condition?

783
01:04:29,590 --> 01:04:32,890
You might as well be asking for a death sentence.

784
01:04:33,190 --> 01:04:34,530
Let me worry about that.

785
01:04:35,130 --> 01:04:36,560
Just bring me a horse.

786
01:04:39,800 --> 01:04:43,470
If it is that urgent, why do you not send a letter?

787
01:04:45,610 --> 01:04:46,610
Honestly.

788
01:04:52,780 --> 01:04:54,980
(Maeshinjeo Courier, Always Swift, Always Reliable)

789
01:04:55,250 --> 01:04:56,450
"Maeshinjeo"?

790
01:05:00,050 --> 01:05:01,220
The Maeshinjeo service to Hanyang!

791
01:05:01,490 --> 01:05:03,520
We wake up instantly, even from sleep.

792
01:05:05,090 --> 01:05:07,959
- Maeshinjeo service!
- Even with food in our mouths,

793
01:05:07,960 --> 01:05:08,960
we rise!

794
01:05:09,560 --> 01:05:10,900
Maeshinjeo service!

795
01:05:11,000 --> 01:05:14,229
Undressing for bed, we rise and run!

796
01:05:14,230 --> 01:05:15,940
Joseon's fastest courier network!

797
01:05:17,070 --> 01:05:18,070
Maeshinjeo service!

798
01:05:20,040 --> 01:05:21,680
(I will reach Hanyang soon.)

799
01:05:35,960 --> 01:05:37,960
Was the Left State Councillor's daughter acting alone?

800
01:05:39,890 --> 01:05:41,430
Or was it at her father's behest?

801
01:05:43,360 --> 01:05:45,000
May you sleep for a very long time.

802
01:05:51,270 --> 01:05:52,540
So it was a death threat.

803
01:05:53,510 --> 01:05:54,710
Hey, come on out!

804
01:06:03,280 --> 01:06:05,720
Come on. Gosh, why is this thing so high?

805
01:06:09,720 --> 01:06:11,660
Goodness.

806
01:06:12,390 --> 01:06:13,460
Let us try this again.

807
01:06:14,160 --> 01:06:16,600
What are you doing up there? Get down from there.

808
01:06:17,400 --> 01:06:18,470
You, debtor guy...

809
01:06:19,000 --> 01:06:22,540
How can I trust my debtor lord to just run off alone?

810
01:06:25,540 --> 01:06:27,980
I promised you a reward, did I not?

811
01:06:29,780 --> 01:06:31,040
In the folktale, it is the swallow's job...

812
01:06:31,380 --> 01:06:32,850
to deliver a gourd seed.

813
01:06:33,910 --> 01:06:36,720
I have not decided if you are Heungbu or Nolbu,

814
01:06:37,220 --> 01:06:39,320
so I have not decided which gourd seed to give you.

815
01:06:41,390 --> 01:06:43,060
I have no idea what she is talking about.

816
01:06:44,830 --> 01:06:45,960
For crying out loud!

817
01:06:46,590 --> 01:06:48,600
How do you even get on this thing? Goodness!

818
01:06:49,430 --> 01:06:50,460
Grab my hand.

819
01:06:59,410 --> 01:07:00,470
Tough it out even if your heart is fluttering.

820
01:07:00,970 --> 01:07:02,940
I do not have the luxury of worrying about your feelings.

821
01:07:04,750 --> 01:07:06,910
Heart fluttering? What nonsense...

822
01:08:11,510 --> 01:08:12,750
Goodness.

823
01:08:24,490 --> 01:08:26,130
What do you think you are doing?

824
01:08:26,430 --> 01:08:29,300
Get off. We have ridden the horse nonstop for two days.

825
01:08:29,430 --> 01:08:31,499
At this rate, you will die out here.

826
01:08:31,500 --> 01:08:32,800
Whether I die or not...

827
01:08:33,500 --> 01:08:35,670
- is my business.
- No.

828
01:08:36,040 --> 01:08:38,870
I saved your life, so your life is my business now.

829
01:08:39,370 --> 01:08:41,640
There is no way I am going to stand by and watch you die.

830
01:08:42,640 --> 01:08:44,750
Fine. Then I will get out of your sight.

831
01:08:47,980 --> 01:08:49,120
Wait.

832
01:08:49,880 --> 01:08:50,880
My gosh.

833
01:08:55,060 --> 01:08:56,060
What? Gosh.

834
01:08:59,030 --> 01:09:00,060
Fine!

835
01:09:00,560 --> 01:09:03,230
Go die alone for all I care!

836
01:09:04,970 --> 01:09:09,040
Bleed out and get eaten by animals. See if I care.

837
01:09:11,670 --> 01:09:12,670
My lord...

838
01:09:13,940 --> 01:09:15,110
How did you...

839
01:09:15,810 --> 01:09:17,210
You made a promise, did you not?

840
01:09:17,680 --> 01:09:18,680
Let us go.

841
01:09:18,880 --> 01:09:20,110
Let us go get some rice soup.

842
01:09:22,350 --> 01:09:25,120
Am I a baby chick? Am I Mongolian? Why can I see so well?

843
01:09:27,820 --> 01:09:29,820
With the cold sweat beading on his forehead,

844
01:09:32,030 --> 01:09:33,030
he is burning up.

845
01:09:33,760 --> 01:09:36,130
I can see how red his eyes and lips are.

846
01:09:39,730 --> 01:09:41,440
How am I supposed to just leave him?

847
01:09:52,210 --> 01:09:53,580
Stop!

848
01:09:55,980 --> 01:09:57,480
Please stop!

849
01:10:00,450 --> 01:10:02,790
I said, stop! You stubborn fool!

850
01:10:04,960 --> 01:10:05,960
Goodness.

851
01:10:06,590 --> 01:10:07,590
Gosh.

852
01:10:19,470 --> 01:10:20,710
Stop...

853
01:10:22,610 --> 01:10:23,640
You are the idiot!

854
01:10:25,180 --> 01:10:26,250
If you fall down,

855
01:10:26,980 --> 01:10:28,380
just stay put and wait!

856
01:10:29,150 --> 01:10:30,520
You could have cried that you were hurt.

857
01:10:31,220 --> 01:10:32,820
Or yelled at me to come back!

858
01:10:33,850 --> 01:10:36,260
Why would you run after me?

859
01:10:39,330 --> 01:10:40,990
I have been thinking about it.

860
01:10:42,430 --> 01:10:45,970
You protected my legs without asking for anything in return.

861
01:10:47,430 --> 01:10:48,900
So that makes you Heungbu, the good guy,

862
01:10:50,840 --> 01:10:53,610
and a swallow never abandons Heungbu.

863
01:11:23,100 --> 01:11:24,100
I did not catch you.

864
01:11:27,010 --> 01:11:28,480
You caught me.

865
01:11:31,910 --> 01:11:33,680
You are the one who came running to my side.

866
01:11:36,880 --> 01:11:38,090
So you have to save me.

867
01:11:41,460 --> 01:11:43,360
Protect me with everything you have.

868
01:11:49,200 --> 01:11:50,200
That is an order.

869
01:12:14,350 --> 01:12:19,330
(Moon River)

870
01:12:34,740 --> 01:12:37,540
The Crown Prince is alive. This complicates things.

871
01:12:37,610 --> 01:12:40,280
Can you guarantee His Royal Highness will return?

872
01:12:40,380 --> 01:12:42,850
The truth does not matter.

873
01:12:42,920 --> 01:12:44,790
I saw you as I was passing by, so I stopped.

874
01:12:44,850 --> 01:12:47,120
And when I did, I finally understood my own heart.

875
01:12:47,820 --> 01:12:49,190
This time, you must live.

876
01:12:50,760 --> 01:12:51,760
Please.

877
01:12:52,460 --> 01:12:53,460
My lord!

878
01:12:54,630 --> 01:12:55,660
Get over here!

879
01:13:03,500 --> 01:13:05,340
Put Grand Prince Je Un on the throne.

880
01:13:06,010 --> 01:13:07,070
And by his side...

881
01:13:08,240 --> 01:13:09,610
is where I will be.

882
01:13:10,280 --> 01:13:11,580
What do you need me to do?

883
01:13:12,150 --> 01:13:15,450
Ambush every road with ruffians from Yeongdeok to Hanyang.

884
01:13:16,120 --> 01:13:17,120
So the Crown Prince...

885
01:13:18,120 --> 01:13:19,820
can never make it back.

886
01:13:36,000 --> 01:13:40,940
(Moon River)
