Crown Princess.

Your Highness.

17
00:03:12,567 --> 00:03:16,100
This is the mark left by a sealed Red Thread.

18
00:03:16,100 --> 00:03:17,567
The Red Thread?

19
00:03:17,567 --> 00:03:22,133
Everyone is born with a Red Thread
tied to their destiny.

20
00:03:22,133 --> 00:03:25,300
Each person's fate is tied by the thread
that connects them.

21
00:03:25,300 --> 00:03:27,833
Since her Red Thread has been sealed,

22
00:03:27,833 --> 00:03:31,816
all past connections and memories
must have vanished.

23
00:03:32,433 --> 00:03:33,800
Are you saying...

24
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:38,833
The first person she sees
upon waking will shape her memories,

25
00:03:38,833 --> 00:03:41,467
so cover it up carefully.

26
00:03:41,467 --> 00:03:46,200
People instinctively seek what they've lost.

27
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:50,200
So be careful she doesn't recover the memories

28
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:54,120
she struggled to erase and doesn't reunite

29
00:03:56,667 --> 00:03:58,833
with that lost connection.

30
00:03:58,833 --> 00:04:00,933
Since the thread was severed once,

31
00:04:00,933 --> 00:04:04,520
they'll be drawn together with even greater force.

32
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:19,100
Your Highness. Your Highness.

33
00:04:54,533 --> 00:04:56,648
Who are you?

34
00:04:58,633 --> 00:05:02,933
You lost your memories after nearly drowning.

35
00:05:02,933 --> 00:05:06,333
Your name is Park Dal I, and I'm your aunt.

36
00:05:06,333 --> 00:05:08,233
Well, not by blood,

37
00:05:08,233 --> 00:05:11,720

You must

43
00:05:33,736 --> 00:05:35,944
never return to Hanyang.

47
00:05:49,867 --> 00:05:53,480
Wait here. Don't move.

48
00:06:30,733 --> 00:06:34,667
The corpse is badly decomposed,
so it's hard to identify the face.

49
00:06:34,667 --> 00:06:37,800
May Your Highness confirm it personally.

50
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:39,720
I refuse.

51
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:42,000
I won't do it.

52
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,767
How can I verify a corpse

53
00:06:44,767 --> 00:06:47,833
that's not my crown princess?

54
00:06:58,600 --> 00:07:01,033
Look properly.

55
00:07:01,033 --> 00:07:04,968
Is this the deposed Crown Princess Kang?

56
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:48,700
If I perform the sword dance,

57
00:07:48,700 --> 00:07:51,464
it will be for Left Minister alone.

58
00:07:54,533 --> 00:07:57,567
I'll sever his head,

59
00:07:57,567 --> 00:08:00,733
and avenge Her Majesty the Queen
and Crown Princess.

60
00:08:00,733 --> 00:08:03,200
I've been curious from the start.

61
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:05,367
Why focus specifically on the Gyesa Year incident?

62
00:08:05,367 --> 00:08:08,233
If it's about avenging
Crown Princess and the Queen,

63
00:08:08,233 --> 00:08:11,567
shouldn't we be digging into
the Queen's poisoning?

64
00:08:11,567 --> 00:08:13,800
We tried all of that

65
00:08:15,267 --> 00:08:17,633
and failed.

66
00:08:18,833 --> 00:08:21,843
Anyone even slightly involved

67
00:08:21,843 --> 00:08:23,667
is already dead.

68
00:08:23,667 --> 00:08:27,167

69
00:08:27,167 --> 00:08:29,704

Why are you calling the physicians here again?

True beauty stems from health.

102

A sound inner self
naturally enhances outer radiance.

103
00:10:25,533 --> 00:10:31,100
The Master Royal Tailor who handles
such beauty should know better than that.

104
00:10:36,967 --> 00:10:42,067
But are you sure the physicians are competent?

105
00:10:42,067 --> 00:10:46,300
I heard real, first-rate physicians
know how to handle poisons well.

106
00:10:46,300 --> 00:10:48,167
Of course.

107
00:10:48,167 --> 00:10:50,000
That would be the case, right?

108
00:10:50,633 --> 00:10:53,800
Ask me about any poison.

109
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:58,300

00:10:58,300 --> 00:10:59,633

or even a sip of alcohol,

114
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:09,300

to turn black and decay.

115
00:11:09,300 --> 00:11:14,568

- Out.
- A single acupuncture needle.

- A sip

122
00:11:29,567 --> 00:11:32,100

- Out.

Out!

129

What could this poison be?

130
00:11:50,667 --> 00:11:52,967
Such poison in this world...

131
00:11:52,967 --> 00:11:55,767
- Your Highness.
- Out!

134
00:11:58,568 --> 00:12:00,500
Everyone said they didn't know,

135
00:12:00,500 --> 00:12:03,600
but those who occasionally
added something all said the same thing.

136
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:06,633
Where in the world is there such a poison?

137
00:12:06,633 --> 00:12:08,867
Well, unless you mean a Zhen poison...

138
00:12:08,867 --> 00:12:11,528

[Zhen bird]
The Poison of the Zhen bird.

140
00:12:13,960 --> 00:12:15,160
It's the Zhen poison.

141
00:12:15,160 --> 00:12:18,560
However, isn't the Zhen bird a mythical creature
conceived in ancient China?

142
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:20,994
Left Minister exploited that very point.

143
00:12:20,994 --> 00:12:24,060
Ghosts and legends are just fanciful tales.

144
00:12:24,060 --> 00:12:26,960
It's as if they've created a story that
the people will find even more fascinating.

145
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:30,594
If it were real, we'd need to investigate in Qing.

146
00:12:30,594 --> 00:12:33,427
It would be dangerous for Your Highness
to conduct the investigation personally.

147
00:12:33,427 --> 00:12:35,127
We need allies outside the palace.

148
00:12:35,127 --> 00:12:36,994
I agree.

149
00:12:36,994 --> 00:12:38,794
It would be better if they were someone

150
00:12:38,794 --> 00:12:41,427
who saw it as their own revenge rather than mine.

151
00:12:41,427 --> 00:12:44,360
Are you Prince Je Woon from Sinjusa?

152
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:47,360
That's correct, but who are you?

153
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:49,427
I'm the Crown Prince.

154
00:12:51,160 --> 00:12:54,960
Despite being reinstated by His Majesty's grace,

155
00:12:54,960 --> 00:12:57,360
I've shamefully neglected to pay respects.

156
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:59,460
Please kill me.

157
00:13:01,260 --> 00:13:04,060
You despise me, right?

158
00:13:04,060 --> 00:13:07,027
You despise His Majesty and Left Minister, right?

159
00:13:09,627 --> 00:13:11,794
Raise your head.

160
00:13:14,027 --> 00:13:16,760
I've come to borrow that heart of yours.

161
00:13:16,760 --> 00:13:19,494
Will you join me in my revenge?

162
00:13:23,227 --> 00:13:27,560
So, what did you gain from this trip to Qing?

163
00:13:27,560 --> 00:13:32,327
After searching, I found an old neighbor
of the man who raised the Zhen bird.

164
00:13:32,327 --> 00:13:33,994
According to the elderly man from Qing,

165
00:13:33,994 --> 00:13:39,294
the person boasted that he sold the Zhen bird
for a large sum during the Imjin Year.

166
00:13:39,294 --> 00:13:41,560
Your Highness.

167
00:13:41,560 --> 00:13:45,694
Left Minister led a delegation to Qing that year.

168
00:13:45,694 --> 00:13:47,027
Indeed.

169
00:13:47,027 --> 00:13:50,594
As Minister of War back then,
his cargo wouldn't be inspected.

170
00:13:50,594 --> 00:13:54,460
And he could have brought in bizarre creatures
like the Zhen bird without anyone noticing.

171
00:13:54,460 --> 00:13:56,860
That old man may also be involved.

172
00:13:56,860 --> 00:13:59,752
Inform me as soon as you receive word from Qing.

173
00:14:02,427 --> 00:14:05,327
I'll send someone tomorrow to fetch the clock.

174
00:14:05,327 --> 00:14:07,060
I've already told you.

175
00:14:07,060 --> 00:14:08,627
The clock is broken.

176
00:14:08,627 --> 00:14:10,094
Bring even the pieces.

177
00:14:10,094 --> 00:14:11,860
I'll claim I broke it.

178
00:14:11,860 --> 00:14:13,660
Why go that far?

179
00:14:13,660 --> 00:14:17,394
Left Minister knows
we fought over the clock, right?

359
00:25:16,327 --> 00:25:19,694
I'll handle things here, run away!

360
00:25:19,694 --> 00:25:21,827
That won't do.

361
00:25:21,827 --> 00:25:25,194
Our young lady has a place she must go...

362
00:25:27,060 --> 00:25:28,680
My lord.

363
00:25:37,094 --> 00:25:39,527
What brings you here, my lord?

364
00:25:39,527 --> 00:25:41,127
Go.

365
00:25:41,127 --> 00:25:43,627
How will you handle them all alone?

366
00:25:43,627 --> 00:25:45,394
Worry about me when you have time to spare.

367
00:25:45,394 --> 00:25:48,194
For now, you should listen to me.

368
00:25:49,160 --> 00:25:52,194
Oh, this is a secret,

369
00:25:52,194 --> 00:25:54,027
but truth is

370
00:25:56,394 --> 00:25:57,994
I'm a master of fighting.

371
00:25:57,994 --> 00:26:00,027
You can trust me and go.

372
00:26:06,894 --> 00:26:09,927
Then I'll leave it to you, my lord.

373
00:26:11,660 --> 00:26:13,894
My lord, though I don't know who you are...

374
00:26:13,894 --> 00:26:17,527
I tolerate this rudeness only
because I don't know your status.

375
00:26:17,527 --> 00:26:19,060
I'm late to introduce myself.

376
00:26:19,060 --> 00:26:21,260
I am Je Woon...

377
00:26:29,527 --> 00:26:33,094
His Highness orders you to no longer
involve yourself in this matter.

378
00:26:33,094 --> 00:26:34,760
If you intervene in the Kim family's affairs,

379
00:26:34,760 --> 00:26:38,024
it may be perceived as a political maneuvering.

380
00:26:43,594 --> 00:26:45,394
Stop.

381
00:26:47,594 --> 00:26:49,460
Why are you doing this? Let us go.

382
00:26:49,460 --> 00:26:51,327
If I let you go,

383
00:26:52,194 --> 00:26:53,427
where would you go?

384
00:26:53,427 --> 00:26:55,027
How far do you think you'll get?

385
00:26:55,027 --> 00:26:58,894
Even if that girl survives,
do you think you'll be safe?

386
00:26:58,894 --> 00:27:01,427
It doesn't matter, so step aside and leave us be.

387
00:27:01,427 --> 00:27:02,760
It's already too late.

388
00:27:02,760 --> 00:27:06,227
- Miss.
- Miss.

389
00:27:20,494 --> 00:27:22,394
It's all

390
00:27:24,394 --> 00:27:26,294
over now.

391
00:27:29,460 --> 00:27:32,727
No, you can't take her.

392
00:27:34,094 --> 00:27:37,727
You're accomplices in this too.

393
00:27:38,394 --> 00:27:43,060
If anything happens to the young lady,
half the blame falls on you, understand?

394
00:27:45,394 --> 00:27:47,860
- Escort the young lady.
- Yes.

395
00:27:47,860 --> 00:27:49,860
Come this way, young lady.

396
00:27:49,860 --> 00:27:51,027
Young lady, wait a moment.

397
00:27:51,027 --> 00:27:52,760
Young lady.

398
00:27:52,760 --> 00:27:54,527
Let me go, please.

399
00:27:54,527 --> 00:27:56,360
No.

400
00:28:08,560 --> 00:28:12,494
You're worse than them, my lord.

401
00:28:12,494 --> 00:28:17,094
They serve masters who hold their lives,

402
00:28:17,094 --> 00:28:19,560
but you are only siding with the highborn

403
00:28:19,560 --> 00:28:22,894
because of some ridiculous law.

404
00:28:25,560 --> 00:28:28,159
I heard you're a runaway slave from Hanyang.

405
00:28:29,260 --> 00:28:30,960
Who said such a...

406
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:35,999
If you want to hide your status,
fix that thick Hanyang accent first.

407
00:28:36,827 --> 00:28:39,127
So,

408
00:28:39,127 --> 00:28:41,494
are you threatening me with my identity now?

409
00:28:41,494 --> 00:28:42,927
I'm not blaming you.

410
00:28:42,927 --> 00:28:45,567
Nor am I here to punish you.

411
00:28:47,094 --> 00:28:49,343
You're very lucky.

412
00:28:50,527 --> 00:28:53,055
Having met me with that face.

413
00:28:53,927 --> 00:28:56,127
I'll give you the money you wanted.

414
00:28:56,127 --> 00:28:59,027
So step away from this matter
and leave Hanyang immediately.

415
00:28:59,027 --> 00:29:00,927
Why would you give me money?

416
00:29:00,927 --> 00:29:03,394
Isn't that why you're acting like this,
for the money?

417
00:29:03,394 --> 00:29:04,827
- What is this...
- A silver dagger.

418
00:29:04,827 --> 00:29:07,627
The Records of Virtuous Women,
Anthology of Suicides, The Tale of Chun Hyang.

419
00:29:07,627 --> 00:29:09,894
- That's...
- Telling others to become chaste women.

420
00:29:09,894 --> 00:29:13,627
You sell all these items encouraging suicide.

421
00:29:13,627 --> 00:29:16,027
Don't you hate seeing women you know die?

422
00:29:16,027 --> 00:29:18,294
Do merchants have no scruples at all?

423
00:29:18,294 --> 00:29:20,460
It's for disguise.

424
00:29:20,460 --> 00:29:22,260
Why would I sell such things?

425
00:29:22,260 --> 00:29:23,360
'Such things'?

426
00:29:23,360 --> 00:29:25,660
If someone wants to die, you should stop them.

427
00:29:25,660 --> 00:29:28,394
Not praise them by publishing
some 'The Records of Virtuous Women.'

428
00:29:28,394 --> 00:29:31,743
If you hold a blade, stab the villain.
Why cut your own throat?

429
00:29:39,060 --> 00:29:40,360
What a novel interpretation.

430
00:29:40,360 --> 00:29:43,494
What would Chun Hyang,
the model of chastity, say to that?

431
00:29:43,494 --> 00:29:47,894
Oh look, another noble
who only knows Chun Hyang by name.

432
00:29:47,894 --> 00:29:49,560
Listen carefully.

433
00:29:49,560 --> 00:29:55,260
What Chun Hyang protected
wasn't chastity, but herself.

434
00:30:00,025 --> 00:30:02,978
[The Tale of Chun Hyang]

435
00:30:05,094 --> 00:30:06,994
- You enjoy that book?
- Yes.

436
00:30:06,994 --> 00:30:11,167
I never knew you cared
so much about chastity, my lady.

437
00:30:13,294 --> 00:30:16,094
Or is this some kind of signal?

438
00:30:16,094 --> 00:30:18,472
The content was quite indecent.

439
00:30:22,394 --> 00:30:26,027
Is that all you saw in The Tale of Chun Hyang?

440
00:30:26,027 --> 00:30:28,894
I feel like you scold me every day.

441
00:30:28,894 --> 00:30:31,427
What Chun Hyang tried to protect

442
00:30:31,427 --> 00:30:34,427
wasn't chastity, but dignity.

443
00:30:35,694 --> 00:30:39,460
Chastity was merely a tool.

444
00:30:40,427 --> 00:30:43,427
A tool to protect her own worth.

445
00:30:45,394 --> 00:30:47,294
A tool?

446
00:30:49,960 --> 00:30:52,194
It was a tool to protect herself
from Magistrate Byeon,

447
00:30:52,194 --> 00:30:55,427
who insisted she was a courtesan for his own lust,

448
00:30:55,427 --> 00:30:58,560
even though he knew she wasn't.

449
00:30:58,560 --> 00:31:02,783
A kind of armor against a cruel world.

450
00:31:03,427 --> 00:31:06,960
Where did you hear that story?

451
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:10,560
I didn't hear it anywhere. It's my own thought.

452
00:31:10,560 --> 00:31:12,927
That can't be.

453
00:31:13,760 --> 00:31:16,960
Do you think we lowborn people
have no thoughts of our own?

454
00:31:20,060 --> 00:31:22,127
Then,

455
00:31:22,127 --> 00:31:24,994
do you know what happens

456
00:31:28,027 --> 00:31:30,394
if you catch a falling petal?

457
00:31:31,460 --> 00:31:34,207
If I catch a falling petal...

458
00:31:41,694 --> 00:31:43,944
If I catch a falling petal...

459
00:31:51,160 --> 00:31:54,360
Why should I tell that to you?

460
00:31:54,360 --> 00:31:55,794
I'll take my leave now.

461
00:31:55,794 --> 00:31:59,976
I don't wish to exchange words
with rude petty men like you.

462
00:32:04,627 --> 00:32:07,194
If I resolve this matter,

463
00:32:07,194 --> 00:32:08,927
will you answer me?

464
00:32:08,927 --> 00:32:09,927
What?

465
00:32:09,927 --> 00:32:12,360
If I resolve this matter,

466
00:32:13,127 --> 00:32:15,594
will you give me an answer?

467
00:32:17,327 --> 00:32:20,427
I'll take your silence as a yes.

468
00:32:20,427 --> 00:32:22,360
First, get treated.

469
00:32:22,360 --> 00:32:25,471
That wound bothers me.

470
00:32:32,927 --> 00:32:34,060
What are you doing?

471
00:32:34,060 --> 00:32:35,827
Let go. What is this?

472
00:32:35,827 --> 00:32:38,360
Let go of me. Why are you doing this?

473
00:32:38,360 --> 00:32:40,727
Why treat me like luggage?

474
00:32:40,727 --> 00:32:42,927
Where are you taking me?

475
00:32:42,927 --> 00:32:44,760
Why this? Oh, my.

476
00:32:44,760 --> 00:32:48,060
The treatment's all finished,
but why are you stopping me?

477
00:32:48,060 --> 00:32:51,227
The lord who brought you said to keep you here

478
00:32:51,227 --> 00:32:53,127
until he returns.

479
00:32:53,127 --> 00:32:55,460
I said I'm leaving.

480
00:32:55,460 --> 00:32:58,327
Why should I be bound by
a complete stranger's words?

481
00:32:58,327 --> 00:33:00,694
That's not my concern.

482
00:33:00,694 --> 00:33:04,160
He left without paying.

483
00:33:06,460 --> 00:33:09,727
Ah, money.

484
00:33:09,727 --> 00:33:11,760
Well, money does matter.

485
00:33:11,760 --> 00:33:12,827
But what should I do?

486
00:33:12,827 --> 00:33:16,127
Looks like you're gonna lose quite a bit of money.

487
00:33:16,127 --> 00:33:19,827
You look like you're gonna lose
way more money than the others.

488
00:33:19,827 --> 00:33:22,127
What, what does that...

489
00:33:22,127 --> 00:33:24,560
Why me?

490
00:33:26,527 --> 00:33:29,527
Want me to tell you why?

491
00:33:41,394 --> 00:33:43,394
Hey, you. Take it easy.

492
00:33:43,394 --> 00:33:45,594
Thief. There's a thief!

493
00:33:45,594 --> 00:33:47,460
Where?

494
00:33:48,863 --> 00:33:50,394
Darn it.

495
00:33:50,394 --> 00:33:53,194
- Where's the thief?
- Over there.

496
00:34:13,227 --> 00:34:17,660
Go put on a show and come back in one piece.

497
00:34:21,660 --> 00:34:23,460
Catch him.

498
00:34:35,460 --> 00:34:36,894
Hup! Hah!

499
00:34:36,894 --> 00:34:40,127
That's right.

500
00:34:47,460 --> 00:34:49,427
Serves him right.

501
00:34:51,294 --> 00:34:53,260
More coming from behind.

502
00:34:57,627 --> 00:35:01,060
A plum blossom in a place like this...

503
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:12,994
Oh, you startled me.

504
00:35:12,994 --> 00:35:17,227
You rat! You knew I was here
and did that on purpose, right?

505
00:35:24,060 --> 00:35:26,060
They say you shouldn't hurt
a person even with a flower.

506
00:35:26,060 --> 00:35:28,727
But you've shattered everything I believed in.

507
00:35:28,727 --> 00:35:32,060
Had you just revealed your status,

508
00:35:32,060 --> 00:35:34,794
you could've kept those principles.

509
00:35:34,794 --> 00:35:37,394
That wouldn't have looked very cool, would it?

510
00:35:38,927 --> 00:35:40,394
Open the door, Shin Won.

511
00:35:40,394 --> 00:35:43,427
- Hey, go open it.
- Shin Won.

512
00:35:51,257 --> 00:35:53,327
This is serious.

513
00:35:53,327 --> 00:35:56,127
Everyone, gather up.

514
00:35:56,127 --> 00:35:59,294
Kim Ji Pyeong is trying to get a chastity monument

515
00:35:59,294 --> 00:36:04,060
by forcing his 15-year-old
daughter-in-law to commit suicide.

516
00:36:05,394 --> 00:36:07,927
That's not the issue here.

517
00:36:07,927 --> 00:36:11,560
If this gets exposed, the entire village
will suffer consequences.

518
00:36:11,560 --> 00:36:13,427
What consequences?

519
00:36:14,094 --> 00:36:16,827
Taxes and labor demands will skyrocket.

520
00:36:16,827 --> 00:36:17,827
By severalfold.

521
00:36:17,827 --> 00:36:20,294
That's the punishment for falsifying
the Virtuous Widow monument.

522
00:36:20,294 --> 00:36:22,794
The village's status will be downgraded.

523
00:36:22,794 --> 00:36:24,560
- Taxes?
- Labor?

524
00:36:24,560 --> 00:36:27,060
They'll increase them? This darn country.

525
00:36:27,060 --> 00:36:28,260
Exactly.

526
00:36:28,260 --> 00:36:30,794
So what do we do?

527
00:36:30,794 --> 00:36:32,660
We need to storm in right now and say,

528
00:36:32,660 --> 00:36:33,960
'We knew nothing!'

529
00:36:33,960 --> 00:36:38,894
Show them we're innocent citizens
who came to save his daughter-in-law.

530
00:36:38,894 --> 00:36:42,894
Are we going to take the blame
all because of that man?

531
00:36:42,894 --> 00:36:44,827
Then there's no time to stand here.

532
00:36:44,827 --> 00:36:48,060
Let's go finish off that punk immediately.

533
00:36:48,060 --> 00:36:53,060
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

534
00:36:53,894 --> 00:36:57,631
Go honorably as the daughter-in-law
of the Kim family.

535
00:36:58,494 --> 00:37:00,660
I made a promise to my husband.

536
00:37:00,660 --> 00:37:03,794
I vowed never to follow him in death.

537
00:37:03,794 --> 00:37:06,660
We promised to meet again long from now

538
00:37:06,660 --> 00:37:09,094
and live together for a hundred years.

539
00:37:09,094 --> 00:37:12,660
Who would benefit from a death
that neither my husband

540
00:37:12,660 --> 00:37:14,294
nor I wished for?

541
00:37:14,294 --> 00:37:17,727
How dare you beg for your life
by selling my late son's honor?

542
00:37:17,727 --> 00:37:20,527
A will can always be forged, and as for a life,

543
00:37:20,527 --> 00:37:22,127
well, I could always end it myself...

544
00:37:22,127 --> 00:37:23,227
No, that won't do.

545
00:37:23,227 --> 00:37:25,427
Right, that won't do.

546
00:37:27,094 --> 00:37:29,527
Who are you?

547
00:37:29,527 --> 00:37:32,160
You, sir...

548
00:37:32,160 --> 00:37:34,027
Let me see.

549
00:37:34,027 --> 00:37:36,327
A silver dagger for slitting throats,

550
00:37:36,327 --> 00:37:37,927
a rope for hanging,

551
00:37:37,927 --> 00:37:41,360
and the water used for poisoning...

552
00:37:41,360 --> 00:37:42,894
It's obvious, isn't it?

553
00:37:42,894 --> 00:37:44,260
Who are you?

554
00:37:44,260 --> 00:37:45,927
How did you get in here?

555
00:37:45,927 --> 00:37:49,027
Is there no one outside?

556
00:37:52,594 --> 00:37:55,527
Now, abandon any thought of killing that woman.

557
00:37:55,527 --> 00:37:58,460
If I hear even a whisper that she's dead,

558
00:37:58,460 --> 00:38:03,060
not even three generations of your family
could take the civil service exam.

559
00:38:03,060 --> 00:38:05,527
If that woman dies,

560
00:38:05,527 --> 00:38:07,560
so will you.

561
00:38:10,560 --> 00:38:12,194
- Open the door.
- Who's there?

562
00:38:12,194 --> 00:38:15,094
- Who is it?
- You miserable punk!

563
00:38:15,094 --> 00:38:17,855
- Open up!
- Who's there?

564
00:38:17,855 --> 00:38:19,060
Wait, wait...

565
00:38:19,060 --> 00:38:20,671
Hey, you!

566
00:38:20,671 --> 00:38:23,829
- You...
- Why is he tied up?

567
00:38:24,827 --> 00:38:28,260
That wretch Kim Ji Pyeong got what he deserved.

568
00:38:35,927 --> 00:38:37,760
Young lady.

569
00:38:40,760 --> 00:38:41,927
What a relief.

570
00:38:41,927 --> 00:38:44,194
Are you unharmed?

571
00:38:45,027 --> 00:38:46,460
What's going on here?

572
00:38:46,460 --> 00:38:47,494
It's unusual.

573
00:38:47,494 --> 00:38:49,127
It's a misunderstanding, right?

574
00:38:49,127 --> 00:38:51,060
It really does seem so.

575
00:38:51,060 --> 00:38:54,460
If you return to the palace
without arresting him, they'll kill us.

576
00:38:54,460 --> 00:38:57,294
Then let's just smile for now.

577
00:38:57,294 --> 00:39:00,094
Over there, over there!

578
00:39:00,827 --> 00:39:03,460
That's him!

579
00:39:03,460 --> 00:39:06,127
My lord!

580
00:39:10,294 --> 00:39:11,894
What's the matter?

581
00:39:11,894 --> 00:39:14,060
We received a report of a thief
and came to investigate.

582
00:39:14,060 --> 00:39:15,160
No.

583
00:39:15,160 --> 00:39:17,760
They tried to force this lady
to kill herself for the monument,

584
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:21,194
but this gentleman here saved her.

585
00:39:21,194 --> 00:39:23,560
Is that true?

586
00:39:23,560 --> 00:39:26,271
Oh, well...

587
00:39:26,271 --> 00:39:29,060
The woman speaks the truth.

588
00:39:29,060 --> 00:39:31,994
I witnessed the scene myself.

589
00:39:32,994 --> 00:39:34,360
Arrest that criminal

590
00:39:34,360 --> 00:39:38,094
who defied the law and insulted His Majesty!

591
00:39:38,094 --> 00:39:40,294
Arrest him!

592
00:39:40,294 --> 00:39:41,660
Quickly, take him away.

593
00:39:41,660 --> 00:39:43,894
By the way, who are you?

594
00:39:43,894 --> 00:39:47,627
Ah, this person is the Crown Prince...

595
00:39:49,427 --> 00:39:55,394
Crown Prince specially appointed
him as a secret inspector.

596
00:39:56,927 --> 00:39:59,227
Show us your royal token.

597
00:40:05,194 --> 00:40:08,660
Are you Shin Won?

598
00:40:08,660 --> 00:40:10,460
Then, he's...

599
00:40:11,960 --> 00:40:14,494
- Your Highness.
- His Highness personally

600
00:40:14,494 --> 00:40:18,560
appointed him as the secret inspector.

601
00:40:18,560 --> 00:40:19,927
He's the secret inspector.

602
00:40:19,927 --> 00:40:22,294
His... Highness.

603
00:40:24,394 --> 00:40:27,294
Yes, my lord, I shall obey your orders.

604
00:40:27,294 --> 00:40:30,060
Good.

605
00:40:30,060 --> 00:40:31,394
Arrest the criminals.

606
00:40:31,394 --> 00:40:33,194
- Yes.
- Yes.

607
00:40:35,227 --> 00:40:36,827
It's over now.

608
00:40:36,827 --> 00:40:38,827
Don't worry.

609
00:40:43,627 --> 00:40:45,827
You vile wretch.

610
00:40:59,594 --> 00:41:02,427
Will you answer me now?

611
00:41:02,427 --> 00:41:06,627
Do you know what happens
if you catch a falling petal?

612
00:41:14,027 --> 00:41:15,660
<i>Did you know that?</i>

613
00:41:15,660 --> 00:41:18,527
<i>If you catch a falling petal,</i>

614
00:41:18,527 --> 00:41:21,027
<i>your first love will come true.</i>

615
00:41:45,494 --> 00:41:47,060
Why? Why?

616
00:41:47,060 --> 00:41:49,294
You said you didn't know,
but why keep following me?

617
00:41:49,294 --> 00:41:51,167
When did I ever say I didn't know?

618
00:41:51,167 --> 00:41:52,894
I just said you'd become the person
who caught the petal.

619
00:41:52,894 --> 00:41:55,427
So that means you don't understand.

620
00:41:55,427 --> 00:41:57,427
Since my business with you is concluded,

621
00:41:57,427 --> 00:41:59,527
you should leave now.

622
00:42:01,094 --> 00:42:04,959
But I still have unfinished business.

623
00:42:11,527 --> 00:42:13,894
Thank you

624
00:42:13,894 --> 00:42:16,227
for saving the young lady.

625
00:42:21,560 --> 00:42:23,960
No need for gratitude.

626
00:42:23,960 --> 00:42:26,079
I did it for my own sake anyway.

627
00:42:27,060 --> 00:42:29,027
To be precise, what I saved

628
00:42:29,027 --> 00:42:31,427
was that woman's late husband.

629
00:42:31,427 --> 00:42:34,160
If he knew she died like that,

630
00:42:34,160 --> 00:42:36,511
he'd wander the afterlife endlessly.

631
00:42:37,527 --> 00:42:39,688
This was done

632
00:42:39,688 --> 00:42:41,727
for a weak man

633
00:42:44,760 --> 00:42:47,423
who would regret it for a long time.

634
00:44:07,960 --> 00:44:13,094
My apologies. You looked so distressed, my lord...

635
00:44:14,094 --> 00:44:15,794
Was that supposed to comfort me?

636
00:44:15,794 --> 00:44:17,427
What right do I have to do that?

637
00:44:17,427 --> 00:44:20,094
What connection could there be
between your sorrow and me?

638
00:44:20,094 --> 00:44:22,160
There is a connection.

639
00:44:26,060 --> 00:44:28,794
Because of you, I've been

640
00:44:29,594 --> 00:44:31,594
trapped in a dream.

641
00:44:34,894 --> 00:44:37,827
A long-awaited

642
00:44:37,827 --> 00:44:39,727
nightmare.

643
00:44:44,460 --> 00:44:47,927
You look sorrowful even now.

644
00:44:47,927 --> 00:44:50,094
Then this time,

645
00:44:50,760 --> 00:44:53,360
how will you comfort me?

646
00:45:00,127 --> 00:45:02,794
Shall I buy you some soup rice?

647
00:45:02,794 --> 00:45:04,894
- So random?
- A full stomach

648
00:45:04,894 --> 00:45:07,194
warms the heart.

649
00:45:07,194 --> 00:45:09,327
It's not a bad idea.

650
00:45:13,027 --> 00:45:14,227
My lord.

651
00:45:14,227 --> 00:45:16,327
It's getting late, so you should return now...

652
00:45:16,327 --> 00:45:17,460
Very well.

653
00:45:17,460 --> 00:45:20,607
Buy me the soup rice.

654
00:45:23,394 --> 00:45:27,060
His Highness resolved the false chaste widow case?

655
00:45:27,060 --> 00:45:29,494
Did he want to imitate a sage king or something?

656
00:45:29,494 --> 00:45:31,860
Oh, hardly.

657
00:45:31,860 --> 00:45:33,327
He just stumbled into it.

658
00:45:33,327 --> 00:45:37,760
Even if indulgent, the Crown Prince
who cares nothing for politics,

659
00:45:37,760 --> 00:45:40,060
what kind of sage king...

660
00:45:41,960 --> 00:45:44,994
Whether stumbled upon or hunted down,

661
00:45:44,994 --> 00:45:48,760
a rampaging tiger needs a collar.

662
00:45:48,760 --> 00:45:50,794
Is Tak here?

663
00:45:50,794 --> 00:45:53,260
Yes, what can I do?

664
00:45:53,260 --> 00:45:56,994
It's been ages since you sent a letter
to Woo Hee, and she still hasn't come?

665
00:45:56,994 --> 00:46:00,727
The young lady remains stubbornly resistant.

666
00:46:01,560 --> 00:46:04,127
Send a palanquin immediately.

667
00:46:04,127 --> 00:46:06,627
Drag her here if necessary.

668
00:46:35,960 --> 00:46:40,194
<i>You must enter royal marriage
with the Crown Prince. Come to the capital.</i>

669
00:46:40,194 --> 00:46:42,127
If you refuse again this time,

670
00:46:42,127 --> 00:46:47,127
your father will burn down Sinjusa.

671
00:46:47,127 --> 00:46:50,894
We just need to buy up all the poison
in Yeongdeok and fetch water for it.

672
00:46:50,894 --> 00:46:52,094
What's the problem?

673
00:46:52,094 --> 00:46:56,160
Ah, this father-daughter feud
will boost the local economy.

674
00:46:58,594 --> 00:47:03,194
So you have no intention of marrying into royalty?

675
00:47:03,194 --> 00:47:05,527
My lady.

676
00:47:05,527 --> 00:47:08,827
You're already past marriageable age.

677
00:47:08,827 --> 00:47:13,527
Do you intend to grow old and die alone
as a solitary maiden ghost?

678
00:47:13,527 --> 00:47:16,394
- Not at all.
- But how long can you hold out?

679
00:47:16,394 --> 00:47:19,760
Do you think you can marry your true love?

680
00:47:31,827 --> 00:47:35,106
[One Year Ago]

681
00:47:56,327 --> 00:47:58,794
Would you like to try?

682
00:48:00,960 --> 00:48:02,627
I don't feel inclined to.

683
00:48:02,627 --> 00:48:04,694
Isn't it a tool to harm people?

684
00:48:04,694 --> 00:48:06,427
No, it's a tool to protect.

685
00:48:06,427 --> 00:48:10,127
If I fire this at someone,

686
00:48:10,127 --> 00:48:12,927
it's to protect something.

687
00:48:24,560 --> 00:48:26,794
Don't use this gun.

688
00:48:28,360 --> 00:48:31,094
I'll always

689
00:48:31,094 --> 00:48:33,894
hold your hand whenever you need me.

690
00:48:48,527 --> 00:48:50,664
Then I must

691
00:48:50,664 --> 00:48:53,294
protect him now.

692
00:49:20,260 --> 00:49:21,694
Hey!

693
00:49:21,694 --> 00:49:24,194
Park Dal I!

694
00:49:24,194 --> 00:49:25,494
You, you...

695
00:49:25,494 --> 00:49:26,960
What are you doing?

696
00:49:26,960 --> 00:49:29,460
Mother, Father, why are you here?

697
00:49:31,727 --> 00:49:33,694
Royal Inspector.

698
00:49:33,694 --> 00:49:36,060
About that soup rice...

699
00:49:36,060 --> 00:49:38,160
- What? Hey!
- Let's take a rain check.

700
00:49:38,160 --> 00:49:39,760
I must go now.

701
00:49:39,760 --> 00:49:40,960
- What is she saying?
- Hide, hide.

702
00:49:40,960 --> 00:49:41,994
You want me to hide?

703
00:49:41,994 --> 00:49:43,960
Wait, we came all this way. Where are you going?

704
00:49:43,960 --> 00:49:46,794
And if we're taking a rain check,

705
00:49:46,794 --> 00:49:49,160
you should specify the new time clearly.

706
00:49:49,160 --> 00:49:50,594
Well then,

707
00:49:50,594 --> 00:49:53,794
[Oh Hour: 11 AM to 1 PM]
meet here tomorrow at noon.

708
00:49:53,794 --> 00:49:54,960
Oh hour?

709
00:49:54,960 --> 00:49:57,060
If I come at noon tomorrow, we'll meet here?

710
00:49:57,060 --> 00:49:58,394
- Yes.
- What?

711
00:49:58,394 --> 00:50:00,394
- What?
- I'll take my leave now.

712
00:50:00,394 --> 00:50:02,312
Why are you acting like this?

713
00:50:05,594 --> 00:50:07,660
She really has parents?

714
00:50:07,660 --> 00:50:10,560
Is there more you need to verify?

715
00:50:10,560 --> 00:50:11,660
No.

716
00:50:11,660 --> 00:50:15,127
If there's nothing else, don't meet her tomorrow.

717
00:50:15,127 --> 00:50:17,194
But Shin Won.

718
00:50:17,960 --> 00:50:20,760
It doesn't disappear when touched.

719
00:50:23,060 --> 00:50:26,127
That's why I keep wanting it.

720
00:50:26,927 --> 00:50:28,994
Can't I just be

721
00:50:29,660 --> 00:50:33,060
a little shameless, even for a moment?

722
00:50:40,827 --> 00:50:42,194
Where do you think you've come?

723
00:50:42,194 --> 00:50:43,527
This is Hanyang! Hanyang.

724
00:50:43,527 --> 00:50:44,827
The capital where the palace stands.

725
00:50:44,827 --> 00:50:46,360
Do you have any sense of that, or not?

726
00:50:46,360 --> 00:50:48,960
Mother, Father, if something
happens to you, what will I do alone?

727
00:50:48,960 --> 00:50:50,660
Good grief.

728
00:50:50,660 --> 00:50:52,327
Why is she stealing my lines?

729
00:50:52,327 --> 00:50:54,127
The one who made the mess is angry.

730
00:50:54,127 --> 00:50:56,494
And furious, at that.

731
00:50:56,494 --> 00:50:58,327
Like I wouldn't be mad right now?

732
00:50:58,327 --> 00:51:00,660
The eunuch and the head court lady
who had an affair and escaped as sinners

733
00:51:00,660 --> 00:51:03,494
boldly came all the way to Hanyang?

734
00:51:03,494 --> 00:51:04,627
How did you find that out?

735
00:51:04,627 --> 00:51:07,394
That we were head court lady
and eunuch? Did your aunt tell you?

736
00:51:07,394 --> 00:51:09,594
What are you saying?

737
00:51:09,594 --> 00:51:11,260
I'd be so dumb

738
00:51:11,260 --> 00:51:13,994
if I didn't notice what Father's like every day.

739
00:51:13,994 --> 00:51:18,427
Father's constantly trimming
and attaching his mustache day after day.

740
00:51:18,427 --> 00:51:19,494
And Mother?

741
00:51:19,494 --> 00:51:21,727
You are fluent in palace terms.

742
00:51:21,727 --> 00:51:23,094
It's obvious at first glance.

743
00:51:23,094 --> 00:51:25,427
The eunuch and head court lady

744
00:51:25,427 --> 00:51:28,060
had an affair and fled at night.

745
00:51:30,460 --> 00:51:32,760
Clever, see?

746
00:51:32,760 --> 00:51:36,260
My son, no, my daughter is so smart.

747
00:51:36,260 --> 00:51:39,127
Is this really something to applaud?

748
00:51:39,794 --> 00:51:41,594
It's something to be punished for.

749
00:51:41,594 --> 00:51:45,227
Right. Before real trouble comes,
you two pack and leave first.

750
00:51:45,227 --> 00:51:47,094
I have something to take care of before I go.

751
00:51:47,094 --> 00:51:48,260
Good grief.

752
00:51:48,260 --> 00:51:49,727
Where are you running off to?

753
00:51:49,727 --> 00:51:52,294
You think only we're criminals?
You're a criminal too.

754
00:51:52,294 --> 00:51:55,360
Want to get caught wandering around
and live as a slave forever?

755
00:51:55,360 --> 00:51:58,894
I've spent years erasing even the mole
on my nose to avoid being caught.

756
00:51:58,894 --> 00:52:00,494
There's always a way.

757
00:52:00,494 --> 00:52:02,094
Carefully hide just like this.

758
00:52:02,094 --> 00:52:04,460
Yeah, leave her be.

759
00:52:04,460 --> 00:52:08,094
Thinking her plain face
needs a pretty slave tattoo.

760
00:52:08,094 --> 00:52:10,360
Wow, how glamorous.

761
00:52:10,360 --> 00:52:11,994
What a character.

762
00:52:11,994 --> 00:52:13,560
Enough. Enough.

763
00:52:13,560 --> 00:52:16,594
When I leave, I'm no longer a person.

764
00:52:18,227 --> 00:52:19,260
What are you doing?

765
00:52:19,260 --> 00:52:21,094
- I'll just sleep.
- Yeah, right.

766
00:52:21,094 --> 00:52:23,727
- Sleep. Sleep.
- Go to sleep now.

767
00:52:43,627 --> 00:52:44,827
You wench!

768
00:52:44,827 --> 00:52:46,394
Going to the restroom, huh? Why?

769
00:52:46,394 --> 00:52:49,360
Court ladies have eyes but cannot see,

770
00:52:49,360 --> 00:52:52,394
mouths but cannot speak.

771
00:52:57,427 --> 00:52:59,260
Jeez.

772
00:53:07,727 --> 00:53:12,094
With the way you're acting,
how could I not know your backgrounds?

773
00:53:22,894 --> 00:53:25,327
Truly, thank you.

774
00:53:26,594 --> 00:53:27,627
Oh, my.

775
00:53:27,627 --> 00:53:29,394
I won't forget

776
00:53:29,394 --> 00:53:32,627
this favor even in death.

777
00:53:32,627 --> 00:53:34,794
Forget it.

778
00:53:35,494 --> 00:53:38,694
Leave all the bad memories behind

779
00:53:39,827 --> 00:53:42,727
and only build good ones.

780
00:54:04,960 --> 00:54:07,960
I'll just eat one bowl of soup
and come right back.

781
00:54:07,960 --> 00:54:11,960
Look at our daughter's audacity!

782
00:54:11,960 --> 00:54:15,427
Staking her life on a bowl of soup?

783
00:54:15,427 --> 00:54:17,260
Jeez.

784
00:54:21,727 --> 00:54:22,794
What is it?

785
00:54:22,794 --> 00:54:24,627
Here.

786
00:54:25,794 --> 00:54:27,627
My lord.

787
00:54:28,660 --> 00:54:33,094
If you're the merchant, the guild
and traders would know for sure.

788
00:54:33,094 --> 00:54:34,594
Do you even know Qing interpreters?

789
00:54:34,594 --> 00:54:36,960
I even did

790
00:54:36,960 --> 00:54:41,594
some business in Uiju,
Joseon's third city connecting

791
00:54:41,594 --> 00:54:43,060
Hanyang and Pyongyang.

792
00:54:43,060 --> 00:54:46,194
That's the hub for trade with Qing, isn't it?

793
00:54:47,260 --> 00:54:48,527
Can you find people too?

794
00:54:48,527 --> 00:54:49,827
Ugh,

795
00:54:49,827 --> 00:54:51,127
it's tiring to explain.

796
00:54:51,127 --> 00:54:53,627
Roaming around everywhere is my job.

797
00:54:53,627 --> 00:54:56,594
You can just imagine all the merchants I know

798
00:54:56,594 --> 00:54:59,194
being spread all over the country.

799
00:54:59,194 --> 00:55:00,894
I've found your use.

800
00:55:00,894 --> 00:55:02,894
We need to draw up a contract, so follow me.

801
00:55:02,894 --> 00:55:05,194
Can't. I have plans.

802
00:55:05,194 --> 00:55:08,194
I'm having rice soup with the secret inspector.

803
00:55:08,194 --> 00:55:12,427
- The inspector?
- Your cousin I met yesterday.

804
00:55:12,427 --> 00:55:14,360
He became a secret royal inspector already?

805
00:55:14,360 --> 00:55:18,094
Ah, so you're not very close.

806
00:55:19,127 --> 00:55:20,360
But

807
00:55:20,360 --> 00:55:25,227
how can a prince's cousin take an official post?

808
00:55:26,560 --> 00:55:28,394
That's...

809
00:55:29,527 --> 00:55:31,427
He's my maternal cousin.

810
00:55:32,994 --> 00:55:34,527
Ah, right.

811
00:55:34,527 --> 00:55:36,827
Makes sense.

812
00:55:36,827 --> 00:55:37,827
Alright.

813
00:55:37,827 --> 00:55:41,094
Anyway, come to my place after eating.

814
00:55:42,327 --> 00:55:45,027
Why would I go to a bachelor's house alone?

815
00:55:45,894 --> 00:55:47,727
Alone?

816
00:55:49,494 --> 00:55:51,594
Don't worry, I have many household members.

817
00:55:51,594 --> 00:55:54,194
Let's meet later then.

818
00:55:54,194 --> 00:55:56,194
Ask my cousin where my house is.

819
00:55:56,194 --> 00:55:58,360
And if you run away again,

820
00:55:58,360 --> 00:56:01,060
I'll report you to the Podocheong.

821
00:56:14,960 --> 00:56:17,594
Keep your eyes straight ahead when you walk.

822
00:56:18,727 --> 00:56:20,960
You should focus on your own path instead.

823
00:56:20,960 --> 00:56:22,360
- What?
- What?

824
00:56:22,360 --> 00:56:24,895
Hey you!

825
00:56:29,727 --> 00:56:33,160
Why is he losing his temper at me
after bumping into me?

826
00:56:37,060 --> 00:56:40,160
But, she said she'd come.
Why hasn't she arrived yet?

827
00:56:40,160 --> 00:56:42,094
Did something happen?

828
00:56:42,094 --> 00:56:45,060
I'm starving to death.

829
00:56:45,060 --> 00:56:48,494
Can I just eat first?

830
00:56:48,494 --> 00:56:50,360
Do you really think that's okay?

831
00:56:50,994 --> 00:56:53,194
Wait, you rented this entire tavern
for that backpack-carrying porter,

832
00:56:53,194 --> 00:56:54,994
yet you can't spare a single bowl of soup for me,

833
00:56:54,994 --> 00:56:58,594
who's served Your Highness all these years?

834
00:56:58,594 --> 00:56:59,594
Do you really think she's the same as you?

835
00:56:59,594 --> 00:57:00,727
What's the difference?

836
00:57:00,727 --> 00:57:02,260
The years I spent with Your Highness,

837
00:57:02,260 --> 00:57:04,160
my loyalty dedicated to you,

838
00:57:04,160 --> 00:57:06,794
how am I any less than that porter?

839
00:57:06,794 --> 00:57:09,794
My heart is different, you fool.

840
00:57:09,794 --> 00:57:11,794
Hmph.

841
00:57:13,894 --> 00:57:15,860
'Hmph'?

842
00:57:15,860 --> 00:57:17,860
You.

843
00:57:17,860 --> 00:57:19,727
Put some fire in your eyes

844
00:57:19,727 --> 00:57:21,527
and smile.

845
00:57:21,527 --> 00:57:24,127
Ugh, seriously.

846
00:57:26,427 --> 00:57:29,694
That guy's hopeless.

847
00:57:30,527 --> 00:57:33,894
The broth is rich.

848
00:57:54,060 --> 00:57:57,560
<i>There's something familiar</i>

849
00:57:57,560 --> 00:58:00,460
<i>about this stranger.</i>

850
00:58:01,194 --> 00:58:06,294
<i>A scruffy little mustache on a smooth,</i>

851
00:58:07,627 --> 00:58:11,927
<i>unshaven chin, giving off</i>

852
00:58:14,460 --> 00:58:17,860
<i>a strangely timid vibe.</i>

853
00:58:17,860 --> 00:58:19,460
<i>A man,</i>

854
00:58:19,460 --> 00:58:21,527
<i>yet somehow</i>

855
00:58:21,527 --> 00:58:24,936
<i>not quite a man.</i>

856
00:58:41,145 --> 00:58:43,170
[The First Place]

857
00:58:44,827 --> 00:58:46,060
No, no!

858
00:58:46,060 --> 00:58:48,860
Why are you dragging me around

859
00:58:48,860 --> 00:58:50,227
like some dog?

860
00:58:50,227 --> 00:58:52,794
You're insane! Insane.

861
00:58:52,794 --> 00:58:54,894
Isn't that the eunuch from earlier?

862
00:58:54,894 --> 00:58:57,627
Even you can tell, right? Huh?

863
00:58:57,627 --> 00:59:01,127
Wow, it's been a while since I came to Hanyang,

864
00:59:01,127 --> 00:59:02,594
and I've seen my juniors.

865
00:59:02,594 --> 00:59:06,060
Ah, so you like that?

866
00:59:06,060 --> 00:59:07,760
If a civil official is beside the eunuch,

867
00:59:07,760 --> 00:59:10,694
and a military official
beside the civil one, what could that be?

868
00:59:10,694 --> 00:59:13,860
Well, usually a king, a prince...

869
00:59:18,094 --> 00:59:22,027
- Or the Crown Prince.
- Shh.

870
00:59:22,027 --> 00:59:26,560
Come to think of it, wasn't the noble
with Dal I yesterday the Crown Prince?

871
00:59:26,560 --> 00:59:27,827
Wow.

872
00:59:27,827 --> 00:59:31,194
Your perception is just remarkable, really.

873
00:59:31,194 --> 00:59:32,994
So good!

874
00:59:33,994 --> 00:59:35,260
Jeez.

875
00:59:35,260 --> 00:59:37,094
With your utter lack of awareness,

876
00:59:37,094 --> 00:59:41,227
I'll have to watch out for you too.

877
00:59:41,227 --> 00:59:44,527
Anyway, where do we even find her?

878
00:59:44,527 --> 00:59:47,627
Though my body goes to Minister's house,

879
00:59:47,627 --> 00:59:50,495
my heart will always remain here.

880
00:59:52,794 --> 00:59:55,327
Did you handle the last task I gave you?

881
00:59:55,327 --> 00:59:56,694
Of course!

882
00:59:56,694 --> 00:59:58,984
That girl who ran off with the young lady

883
00:59:58,984 --> 01:00:01,194
won't remain safe.

884
01:00:11,294 --> 01:00:14,160
Walk straight and keep your eyes forward.

885
01:00:18,694 --> 01:00:20,494
Brother.

886
01:00:24,994 --> 01:00:29,727
People always leave a mess till the end.

887
01:00:29,727 --> 01:00:31,760
Hey, you thief!

888
01:00:31,760 --> 01:00:33,427
Catch her, catch her.

889
01:00:33,427 --> 01:00:35,494
Hey, you thief!

890
01:00:35,494 --> 01:00:36,727
Hey, you thief!

891
01:00:36,727 --> 01:00:38,860
You thief.

892
01:00:39,494 --> 01:00:42,927
Why are you doing this? Let go!

893
01:00:46,827 --> 01:00:48,360
How can a girl be so strong?

894
01:00:48,360 --> 01:00:51,127
Never underestimate a porter again.

895
01:00:51,894 --> 01:00:52,960
This is the girl.

896
01:00:52,960 --> 01:00:54,727
This rat stole my stuff.

897
01:00:54,727 --> 01:00:56,360
What nonsense is this now?

898
01:00:56,360 --> 01:00:57,960
Did you eat dog food for breakfast?

899
01:00:57,960 --> 01:00:59,760
You're putting real effort into barking lies.

900
01:00:59,760 --> 01:01:02,494
Let's see your belongings.

901
01:01:02,494 --> 01:01:04,894
What are you doing?

902
01:01:04,894 --> 01:01:06,394
I said it's nonsense!

903
01:01:06,394 --> 01:01:08,194
Look here.

904
01:01:13,527 --> 01:01:15,660
See? You're the thief.

905
01:01:15,660 --> 01:01:18,294
This trinket is the stolen item.

906
01:01:18,294 --> 01:01:19,760
Why would this suddenly...

907
01:01:19,760 --> 01:01:21,994
There's nothing more to see, take her away.

908
01:01:21,994 --> 01:01:23,227
- Yes.
- Yes.

909
01:01:23,227 --> 01:01:25,827
The slave hunters are still looking for you,

910
01:01:25,827 --> 01:01:29,027
so you must never go to Hanyang.

911
01:01:29,027 --> 01:01:30,994
Absolutely not.

912
01:01:30,994 --> 01:01:33,127
I must not go to Podocheong.

913
01:01:34,927 --> 01:01:36,460
Since I'm a merchant,

914
01:01:36,460 --> 01:01:40,494
[Dobang: Headquarters of the traveling merchants]
this must be handled according to dobang rules.

915
01:01:40,494 --> 01:01:41,794
Jangmunhyeong punishment?

916
01:01:41,794 --> 01:01:44,227
[Jangmunhyeong: Harsh punishment for the guilty]
Ugh, it'll be filled with screams.

917
01:01:44,227 --> 01:01:46,527
Indeed, cries will echo today.

918
01:01:46,527 --> 01:01:48,895
[Ethics Code: No lies, lust, misconduct, or theft]
We swore to avoid lies, lust,

919
01:01:48,895 --> 01:01:50,460
misconduct, and theft.

920
01:01:50,460 --> 01:01:52,994
Master Leader, that's not true.

921
01:01:52,994 --> 01:01:55,227
If I were guilty, I'd accept punishment,

922
01:01:55,227 --> 01:01:57,194
but I've never stolen anything.

923
01:01:57,194 --> 01:01:59,627
So, after getting a bit more clarity
on the details of the incident...

924
01:01:59,627 --> 01:02:00,660
Silence.

925
01:02:00,660 --> 01:02:02,994
Evidence was found blatantly in your belongings.

926
01:02:02,994 --> 01:02:04,494
How dare you try to deny it?

927
01:02:04,494 --> 01:02:06,027
- That wasn't...
- You there.

928
01:02:06,027 --> 01:02:07,560
Yes.

929
01:02:07,560 --> 01:02:12,394
After rolling up Park Dal I, who violated
the Ethics Code, beat her thirty times,

930
01:02:12,394 --> 01:02:14,827
then sever the lower leg.

931
01:02:15,760 --> 01:02:17,627
Leg amputation is ordered.

932
01:02:17,627 --> 01:02:19,727
- Yes.
- Yes.

933
01:02:19,727 --> 01:02:20,927
Leg amputation?

934
01:02:20,927 --> 01:02:24,294
[Leg Amputation: Cripple limbs with roof tiles]
Master Leader, I'm truly wronged.

935
01:02:24,294 --> 01:02:25,327
Enough.

936
01:02:25,327 --> 01:02:27,694
Oh, my goodness.

937
01:02:27,694 --> 01:02:30,160
No leg amputation. I beg you.

938
01:02:30,160 --> 01:02:31,294
Beat her harshly.

939
01:02:31,294 --> 01:02:33,094
- Yes.
- Yes.

940
01:02:55,294 --> 01:02:57,194
Stop.

It's Jangmunhyeong punishment in progress.

948
01:03:50,127 --> 01:03:54,494

Take this road and leave Hanyang immediately.

965

You, a lowly person,
must pay for that face you have.

966
01:06:04,694 --> 01:06:06,527
Why should I obey you?

967

Where are you going?

968
01:06:08,294 --> 01:06:09,460
To propose.

969
01:06:09,460 --> 01:06:10,860
Didn't you promise?

Are you speaking of rebellion now?

I do.
