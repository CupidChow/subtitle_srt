1
00:00:09,071 --> 00:00:11,041
(All people, incidents, and backgrounds...)

2
00:00:11,101 --> 00:00:12,101
(in this drama are fictitious and unrelated to reality.)

3
00:00:12,101 --> 00:00:13,101
(Also, children and animals were filmed under production guidelines.)

4
00:00:13,371 --> 00:00:17,041
(Final Episode: A Fleeting Memory)

5
00:00:27,821 --> 00:00:28,821
Bring it on.

6
00:00:37,261 --> 00:00:38,531
You cowardly jerk.

7
00:00:42,171 --> 00:00:43,941
You are all very lucky.

8
00:00:45,371 --> 00:00:47,001
You ran into me while I am like this.

9
00:00:52,881 --> 00:00:54,811
Otherwise, you would all be dead...

10
00:00:55,451 --> 00:00:56,711
Or not.

11
00:00:57,221 --> 00:01:00,151
I surrender. There. We good?

12
00:01:22,211 --> 00:01:26,181
Since no one has been caught yet, I guess everyone is safe.

13
00:01:26,381 --> 00:01:29,551
Our fortress has been discovered. Should we not inform everyone?

14
00:01:30,181 --> 00:01:31,921
First, move our base into the village.

15
00:01:32,481 --> 00:01:34,890
I will handle it after the Royal Wedding.

16
00:01:34,891 --> 00:01:35,921
Yes, sir.

17
00:01:56,211 --> 00:01:57,211
Sir.

18
00:02:06,021 --> 00:02:07,351
The mountain fortress is surrounded.

19
00:02:07,651 --> 00:02:09,751
- Find the leader!
- Yes, sir!

20
00:02:32,741 --> 00:02:34,411
You are all dead now...

21
00:02:55,871 --> 00:02:57,270
- Your Highness.
- Your Highness.

22
00:02:57,271 --> 00:02:58,541
- Oh, my. Are you all right?
- Your Highness.

23
00:02:58,601 --> 00:02:59,900
- What is going on?
- Your Highness.

24
00:02:59,901 --> 00:03:01,211
- What happened?
- Your Highness.

25
00:03:02,341 --> 00:03:04,511
- Your Highness.
- I must put an end to this charade.

26
00:03:04,811 --> 00:03:07,111
- Your Highness.
- Summon the Royal Physician!

27
00:03:07,681 --> 00:03:10,621
- Your Majesty!
- Your Majesty!

28
00:03:10,951 --> 00:03:13,991
Gang! Summon the Royal Physician!

29
00:03:14,721 --> 00:03:15,951
Get the Royal Physician!

30
00:03:25,561 --> 00:03:26,561
Gang.

31
00:03:29,871 --> 00:03:33,041
- Your Highness, are you all right?
- Are you okay?

32
00:03:37,041 --> 00:03:38,211
Your Majesty.

33
00:03:40,711 --> 00:03:42,581
The killer of the former King, the Crown Prince,

34
00:03:43,381 --> 00:03:44,981
as well as the Queen Dowager in the Gyesa Year,

35
00:03:46,621 --> 00:03:48,891
is the traitor Kim Han Chul. Please order his arrest!

36
00:03:49,491 --> 00:03:50,491
What?

37
00:03:52,561 --> 00:03:54,991
- That is impossible.
- Kim Han Chul, a traitor?

38
00:03:55,061 --> 00:03:57,091
- That is absurd.
- How dare you call him a traitor?

39
00:03:57,401 --> 00:03:58,731
What in the world is he talking about?

40
00:03:59,001 --> 00:04:00,031
What...

41
00:04:01,031 --> 00:04:02,731
do you think you are doing?

42
00:04:03,231 --> 00:04:04,241
Revenge.

43
00:04:09,611 --> 00:04:10,911
Un will be here.

44
00:04:11,511 --> 00:04:12,541
He has to be.

45
00:04:13,441 --> 00:04:14,451
Your Majesty.

46
00:04:15,711 --> 00:04:17,751
Kim Han Chul's home is connected to a collapsed, abandoned mine...

47
00:04:18,221 --> 00:04:19,981
and a brewery.

48
00:04:22,151 --> 00:04:24,091
It is the brewery with the Jimjo cave.

49
00:04:24,891 --> 00:04:29,791
For over a decade, he abducted and held the former Queen Jangjeong.

50
00:04:29,991 --> 00:04:31,360
He also raised a private army all over the country,

51
00:04:31,361 --> 00:04:32,731
dealt in counterfeiting coins,

52
00:04:32,831 --> 00:04:34,070
illegal weapon manufacturing,

53
00:04:34,071 --> 00:04:35,371
loan sharking, human trafficking, and more.

54
00:04:35,431 --> 00:04:37,571
I have also discovered evidence of all his illegal acts.

55
00:04:40,601 --> 00:04:41,671
Do you...

56
00:04:42,941 --> 00:04:44,381
intend to go down

57
00:04:45,411 --> 00:04:47,241
with me?

58
00:04:51,251 --> 00:04:53,581
Your Highness!

59
00:04:55,151 --> 00:04:56,951
You will be walking that path alone, Left State Councillor.

60
00:04:58,321 --> 00:04:59,421
All alone.

61
00:05:00,361 --> 00:05:01,391
What is going on?

62
00:05:01,731 --> 00:05:02,731
What was that?

63
00:05:07,131 --> 00:05:09,631
Your Highness!

64
00:05:30,961 --> 00:05:31,961
Now,

65
00:05:33,621 --> 00:05:35,691
your era is over, Left State Councillor!

66
00:05:40,871 --> 00:05:41,871
Your Majesty.

67
00:05:44,001 --> 00:05:45,641
I have fulfilled our great cause.

68
00:06:40,021 --> 00:06:41,091
This is a royal order.

69
00:06:41,891 --> 00:06:43,031
Arrest...

70
00:06:44,131 --> 00:06:46,931
- the traitor this instant!
- Yes, Your Majesty!

71
00:06:47,931 --> 00:06:49,001
What is going on?

72
00:07:02,651 --> 00:07:04,781
- What is happening?
- What is going on?

73
00:07:06,051 --> 00:07:08,521
- Protect His Excellency!
- What is going on?

74
00:07:13,261 --> 00:07:14,531
Protect him!

75
00:07:21,371 --> 00:07:22,671
Protect him!

76
00:07:28,471 --> 00:07:29,841
Protect him!

77
00:07:40,991 --> 00:07:42,091
Protect him!

78
00:07:52,461 --> 00:07:55,230
Call physicians and guards for the hurt.

79
00:07:55,231 --> 00:07:56,301
Yes, Your Highness.

80
00:08:16,051 --> 00:08:17,551
What are we supposed to do now?

81
00:08:17,861 --> 00:08:20,021
The Royal Wedding and everything else is all over, is it not?

82
00:08:20,321 --> 00:08:21,561
We are ruined.

83
00:08:22,591 --> 00:08:24,531
- Clear the way!
- Clear the way!

84
00:08:50,221 --> 00:08:52,721
I hereby revoke the title of consort bestowed upon her.

85
00:08:53,761 --> 00:08:56,861
- Arrest the traitor's daughter.
- Yes, Your Majesty.

86
00:08:59,431 --> 00:09:00,431
Your Majesty.

87
00:09:08,641 --> 00:09:09,641
U Hui.

88
00:09:10,411 --> 00:09:11,511
Please do not.

89
00:09:12,511 --> 00:09:14,781
I am now the daughter of a traitor.

90
00:09:16,481 --> 00:09:18,181
If you rush in to save me,

91
00:09:19,721 --> 00:09:21,791
you will be implicated as well, Your Highness.

92
00:09:23,021 --> 00:09:24,891
I would gladly take on all of your crimes.

93
00:09:25,891 --> 00:09:27,291
For now, please stand down.

94
00:09:29,861 --> 00:09:32,361
Your downfall is not part of my plan, Your Highness.

95
00:09:38,641 --> 00:09:39,671
Wait for me.

96
00:09:40,801 --> 00:09:42,171
I will come for you soon.

97
00:09:57,491 --> 00:09:58,491
Your Majesty.

98
00:10:00,121 --> 00:10:01,531
I will go of my own accord.

99
00:10:02,631 --> 00:10:03,831
Please grant me your permission.

100
00:10:06,501 --> 00:10:07,501
So be it.

101
00:11:12,431 --> 00:11:14,131
How did you come to have the secret pact?

102
00:11:14,871 --> 00:11:16,431
But more importantly, how is this possible?

103
00:11:17,171 --> 00:11:19,341
How can you still be alive, Your Majesty?

104
00:11:20,541 --> 00:11:22,241
The Left State Councillor saved my life.

105
00:11:23,711 --> 00:11:25,211
But why would he?

106
00:11:26,141 --> 00:11:27,281
A long time ago,

107
00:11:29,811 --> 00:11:31,121
we were lovers.

108
00:11:35,351 --> 00:11:36,451
As for the secret pact...

109
00:11:46,431 --> 00:11:49,831
For the past 15 years, I was not in my right mind.

110
00:11:50,631 --> 00:11:52,971
My moments of lucidity were few and far between,

111
00:11:53,641 --> 00:11:55,441
starting six years ago.

112
00:11:56,741 --> 00:11:58,411
And it was because of that secret pact.

113
00:11:59,841 --> 00:12:01,551
What do you mean by that?

114
00:12:04,721 --> 00:12:06,651
When the throne passed to His Majesty,

115
00:12:07,821 --> 00:12:09,891
I feared something terrible had happened to you.

116
00:12:13,491 --> 00:12:15,161
Please take me to the palace.

117
00:12:17,161 --> 00:12:18,361
This letter...

118
00:12:19,631 --> 00:12:22,831
- I apologise for her. We must go.
- Let go of me!

119
00:12:24,701 --> 00:12:25,771
Let go!

120
00:12:27,971 --> 00:12:29,471
So I took the secret pact...

121
00:12:30,111 --> 00:12:31,581
and tried to get to you.

122
00:12:32,911 --> 00:12:36,011
I heard she had regained her senses.

123
00:12:36,511 --> 00:12:37,651
It was only for a moment.

124
00:12:41,051 --> 00:12:42,751
She took this and tried to run away.

125
00:12:47,661 --> 00:12:49,361
I will find a new hiding place for it.

126
00:13:12,321 --> 00:13:13,521
We will keep it here.

127
00:13:13,781 --> 00:13:17,651
But you told me to reveal this if you were ever harmed, my lord.

128
00:13:18,191 --> 00:13:20,161
We cannot leave something so vital in this place.

129
00:13:24,961 --> 00:13:26,801
It is to protect her...

130
00:13:27,301 --> 00:13:29,131
that you and your men even exist.

131
00:13:30,471 --> 00:13:31,541
In all of Joseon,

132
00:13:32,341 --> 00:13:35,411
this should be the safest place, should it not?

133
00:13:36,011 --> 00:13:37,071
Even so, my lord,

134
00:13:37,341 --> 00:13:39,581
to leave it in the room of an unstable woman...

135
00:13:41,651 --> 00:13:44,251
Are you confessing your own incompetence?

136
00:13:45,321 --> 00:13:46,451
Forgive me, my lord.

137
00:13:47,621 --> 00:13:49,321
I will obey your command, my lord.

138
00:13:50,491 --> 00:13:51,761
You are dismissed.

139
00:14:01,501 --> 00:14:04,501
I leave my very life in your hands,

140
00:14:06,101 --> 00:14:07,271
so that one day...

141
00:14:09,041 --> 00:14:10,541
you will return to us.

142
00:14:35,071 --> 00:14:36,071
Your Majesty.

143
00:14:36,601 --> 00:14:40,871
Forgive my impertinence, but I have something I must say.

144
00:14:41,071 --> 00:14:42,771
Very well. Speak your mind.

145
00:14:43,741 --> 00:14:45,711
If it had not been for the Left State Councillor's daughter,

146
00:14:46,041 --> 00:14:49,951
we would neither have found the pact nor exposed the councillor's crimes.

147
00:14:50,411 --> 00:14:51,421
So please...

148
00:14:53,421 --> 00:14:56,791
spare U Hui's life. We will flee and live like we are dead.

149
00:14:56,851 --> 00:14:58,291
As if we never existed.

150
00:14:59,421 --> 00:15:02,961
I beg of you, do not turn away from my plea.

151
00:15:05,561 --> 00:15:07,931
If you flee, you can never return.

152
00:15:09,331 --> 00:15:10,331
Je Un.

153
00:15:11,371 --> 00:15:13,701
You are throwing away everything you have.

154
00:15:14,771 --> 00:15:16,611
The only place for me to return to,

155
00:15:17,211 --> 00:15:18,811
and the person I must protect above all else...

156
00:15:21,711 --> 00:15:23,151
is her only.

157
00:15:33,421 --> 00:15:35,361
Where are you taking me?

158
00:15:35,561 --> 00:15:38,461
Do you really think you will get away with this?

159
00:15:42,731 --> 00:15:45,101
Shut your mouth.

160
00:15:52,081 --> 00:15:54,751
The mountain fortress is surrounded. Find the leader!

161
00:15:55,581 --> 00:15:56,581
What is going on?

162
00:15:57,651 --> 00:15:58,951
We are escaping through the back.

163
00:15:59,321 --> 00:16:00,621
What?

164
00:16:08,861 --> 00:16:10,390
No sign of the Left State Councillor?

165
00:16:10,391 --> 00:16:11,531
Forgive me, Your Royal Highness.

166
00:16:13,031 --> 00:16:16,571
- Search beyond the capital.
- Yes, Your Highness. Let us move!

167
00:16:18,471 --> 00:16:19,471
Your Royal Highness.

168
00:16:21,371 --> 00:16:23,141
You are here.

169
00:16:23,771 --> 00:16:27,281
- We have cleared out The Nameless.
- Good work.

170
00:16:29,151 --> 00:16:31,011
But what about Dal?

171
00:16:31,281 --> 00:16:33,381
She left with Queen Jangjeong.

172
00:16:35,021 --> 00:16:37,891
- Has she not arrived in Hanyang?
- You did not see her at the fort?

173
00:16:38,561 --> 00:16:40,361
Did you not surround the Queen's quarters?

174
00:16:40,761 --> 00:16:42,391
There was no one inside her quarters.

175
00:16:56,271 --> 00:16:58,541
Forgive me. The secret pact...

176
00:16:59,211 --> 00:17:00,411
has been stolen.

177
00:17:01,281 --> 00:17:03,451
Let us go to Dongnae and plan for the future.

178
00:17:04,151 --> 00:17:05,821
The one thing you were supposed to protect...

179
00:17:07,021 --> 00:17:08,721
was not the secret pact.

180
00:17:10,051 --> 00:17:11,461
Please kill me, my lord.

181
00:17:12,761 --> 00:17:14,161
Her Majesty the Queen...

182
00:17:15,691 --> 00:17:17,031
went to the palace?

183
00:17:17,431 --> 00:17:20,301
Yes. I heard she went with Grand Prince Lee Un.

184
00:17:30,871 --> 00:17:31,881
Dal!

185
00:17:32,641 --> 00:17:34,640
- Dal!
- Where are you?

186
00:17:34,641 --> 00:17:36,711
- Dal!
- Where are you?

187
00:17:36,781 --> 00:17:37,951
- Where are you?
- Dal!

188
00:17:38,011 --> 00:17:40,921
- Please come out!
- Where are you? Can you hear us?

189
00:17:40,981 --> 00:17:41,991
Wait...

190
00:17:42,251 --> 00:17:43,751
To get to Hanyang from Mount Gamak,

191
00:17:44,151 --> 00:17:45,691
you said they must pass by here, did you not?

192
00:17:45,961 --> 00:17:47,060
Yes.

193
00:17:47,061 --> 00:17:48,261
Then why have we not found her yet?

194
00:17:48,391 --> 00:17:51,331
The Royal Guards are searching. If you could wait a bit longer...

195
00:17:51,391 --> 00:17:52,801
And what if something happens to Dal while we wait?

196
00:17:53,601 --> 00:17:55,501
Your Royal Highness, forgive me.

197
00:17:57,271 --> 00:17:58,401
There is no time.

198
00:17:59,071 --> 00:18:00,101
We are running out of time.

199
00:18:01,101 --> 00:18:02,271
I have to find Dal.

200
00:18:18,391 --> 00:18:19,391
Your Royal Highness.

201
00:18:22,831 --> 00:18:24,161
Please stop, Your Royal Highness.

202
00:18:24,761 --> 00:18:26,131
How can I just stop?

203
00:18:26,931 --> 00:18:28,471
Dal must be so scared all by herself.

204
00:18:29,271 --> 00:18:30,771
She must be terrified, all alone.

205
00:18:31,271 --> 00:18:32,271
Your Royal Highness!

206
00:18:32,272 --> 00:18:35,141
Please take my life.

207
00:18:36,441 --> 00:18:38,381
I failed to guard the Crown Princess.

208
00:18:45,181 --> 00:18:46,481
This is all my fault.

209
00:18:48,021 --> 00:18:49,891
I failed to protect Dal again.

210
00:18:50,851 --> 00:18:51,921
Once again, I have...

211
00:18:53,091 --> 00:18:54,891
sent her to her death.

212
00:19:00,801 --> 00:19:01,801
Your Royal Highness.

213
00:19:03,131 --> 00:19:06,301
The Left Councillor has broken through the Souimun Gate. And...

214
00:19:07,701 --> 00:19:08,711
Say it.

215
00:19:09,911 --> 00:19:10,941
He is holding...

216
00:19:12,441 --> 00:19:14,141
the Crown Princess hostage.

217
00:19:18,881 --> 00:19:19,881
Put this on.

218
00:19:29,791 --> 00:19:31,631
What is with this? It is not like it is for a funeral,

219
00:19:32,501 --> 00:19:34,731
so why make such a scene about changing?

220
00:19:37,201 --> 00:19:38,231
Hurry up!

221
00:19:42,211 --> 00:19:43,311
So they are funeral clothes after all.

222
00:19:44,041 --> 00:19:45,041
They really are.

223
00:21:12,901 --> 00:21:13,901
Let us go.

224
00:21:39,721 --> 00:21:41,691
- The gate has been breached.
- Let us go!

225
00:21:41,761 --> 00:21:42,761
- Let us go!
- Let us go!

226
00:22:04,581 --> 00:22:07,981
Hold the line! Protect the palace! Hold the line!

227
00:22:09,151 --> 00:22:12,391
- Follow His Lordship's orders!
- Yes, sir!

228
00:22:12,691 --> 00:22:13,961
Set it on fire!

229
00:23:04,471 --> 00:23:05,511
Dal!

230
00:23:05,841 --> 00:23:06,841
Your Royal Highness!

231
00:23:14,751 --> 00:23:16,620
No!

232
00:23:16,621 --> 00:23:17,691
No!

233
00:23:42,881 --> 00:23:46,351
She will die in 15 minutes, even without removing the blade.

234
00:23:47,421 --> 00:23:51,861
You have 15 minutes to bring me Queen Jangjeong.

235
00:24:06,871 --> 00:24:09,411
What? The Left Councillor is holding the Crown Princess at knifepoint?

236
00:24:09,771 --> 00:24:11,981
If Her Majesty the Queen is not brought to him within 15 minutes,

237
00:24:12,441 --> 00:24:14,611
he says the Crown Princess's life will be in grave danger.

238
00:24:15,811 --> 00:24:17,281
How can this be happening to the Crown Princess?

239
00:24:17,681 --> 00:24:20,151
- I will go.
- No, Mother, you cannot!

240
00:24:23,051 --> 00:24:24,491
He will not harm me.

241
00:24:28,731 --> 00:24:29,731
Mother!

242
00:24:43,811 --> 00:24:45,481
Do not worry about me.

243
00:24:47,541 --> 00:24:50,211
Do not listen to what he says.

244
00:25:21,881 --> 00:25:23,311
It is starting to rain.

245
00:25:25,011 --> 00:25:26,121
Thank goodness.

246
00:25:44,771 --> 00:25:45,871
No.

247
00:25:51,841 --> 00:25:53,541
As long as you remember me,

248
00:25:55,581 --> 00:25:57,481
and you run in my veins,

249
00:25:58,611 --> 00:26:01,081
No, please do not do that.

250
00:26:05,521 --> 00:26:08,691
- Then we will always be together.
- No...

251
00:26:09,261 --> 00:26:10,791
No! Do not do it!

252
00:26:12,131 --> 00:26:13,361
No!

253
00:26:13,661 --> 00:26:15,631
Your Royal Highness!

254
00:26:16,271 --> 00:26:17,501
No, please!

255
00:26:32,921 --> 00:26:34,551
The traitor, Kim Han Chul...

256
00:26:36,351 --> 00:26:37,451
Arrest him!

257
00:26:38,391 --> 00:26:40,161
No!

258
00:26:43,891 --> 00:26:44,891
Your Royal Highness!

259
00:26:46,861 --> 00:26:47,901
Arrest him!

260
00:27:43,251 --> 00:27:45,151
Your Royal Highness...

261
00:27:53,301 --> 00:27:57,831
Your Highness... Someone get a physician!

262
00:27:58,431 --> 00:28:00,941
Please, someone get a physician!

263
00:28:02,171 --> 00:28:04,441
What do I do?

264
00:28:04,771 --> 00:28:06,881
Your Highness, please do not die.

265
00:28:07,481 --> 00:28:10,281
Do you not dare die on me.

266
00:28:11,751 --> 00:28:15,621
- I am sorry.
- Do not give me that lame apology.

267
00:28:15,851 --> 00:28:19,291
Apologise to me properly later.

268
00:28:20,161 --> 00:28:21,161
I am sorry...

269
00:28:22,761 --> 00:28:24,331
My love for you...

270
00:28:26,601 --> 00:28:28,161
was selfish in the end.

271
00:28:42,151 --> 00:28:44,651
No.

272
00:28:44,781 --> 00:28:47,781
No.

273
00:28:49,121 --> 00:28:52,891
Somebody save her, please. Somebody help me!

274
00:28:59,901 --> 00:29:00,901
Your Royal Highness!

275
00:29:04,301 --> 00:29:07,171
Please save him.

276
00:29:07,971 --> 00:29:09,111
Your Royal Highness...

277
00:29:09,971 --> 00:29:12,311
Just hang on a little longer...

278
00:29:12,641 --> 00:29:14,241
Your Royal Highness...

279
00:29:44,471 --> 00:29:45,471
Mother!

280
00:30:11,701 --> 00:30:12,941
You must not, Mother!

281
00:30:46,901 --> 00:30:47,901
Mother!

282
00:33:22,461 --> 00:33:23,761
How is it?

283
00:33:24,961 --> 00:33:28,801
She has already passed away, Your Royal Highness.

284
00:33:34,541 --> 00:33:35,871
- Your Royal Highness!
- Your Royal Highness!

285
00:33:40,381 --> 00:33:41,411
No...

286
00:33:42,881 --> 00:33:45,611
No!

287
00:33:47,551 --> 00:33:49,621
Where did you go? No!

288
00:33:50,251 --> 00:33:52,491
Who said you could leave?

289
00:33:53,421 --> 00:33:57,331
No, you cannot! You cannot!

290
00:34:20,321 --> 00:34:21,321
Your Royal Highness.

291
00:34:25,521 --> 00:34:26,961
- Your Royal Highness.
- Your Royal Highness.

292
00:34:27,021 --> 00:34:28,061
Your Royal Highness!

293
00:34:48,911 --> 00:34:50,581
Why will we not switch?

294
00:34:51,711 --> 00:34:53,121
Why will we not switch?

295
00:34:56,051 --> 00:34:58,551
Why will we not switch?

296
00:35:00,821 --> 00:35:02,091
Your Royal Highness.

297
00:35:02,861 --> 00:35:04,061
Please, that is enough.

298
00:35:04,261 --> 00:35:06,031
How am I supposed to stop?

299
00:35:07,661 --> 00:35:09,801
He died trying to save me,

300
00:35:10,801 --> 00:35:15,571
and once again, I did nothing. All I have ever done is take,

301
00:35:16,771 --> 00:35:21,041
and now I have even stolen his body, so how can I stop?

302
00:35:21,411 --> 00:35:24,611
I cannot!

303
00:36:26,341 --> 00:36:28,441
- Your Highness!
- Your Highness!

304
00:36:28,781 --> 00:36:30,111
Your Highness, are you all right?

305
00:36:30,551 --> 00:36:33,381
- Your Highness!
- Your Highness, please wake up!

306
00:36:34,451 --> 00:36:35,451
Your Highness.

307
00:36:37,691 --> 00:36:38,691
Your Highness.

308
00:36:41,521 --> 00:36:43,361
- Your Highness.
- Your Highness.

309
00:37:12,551 --> 00:37:14,121
Your Highness!

310
00:37:22,631 --> 00:37:25,931
Your Highness, are you back?

311
00:37:28,871 --> 00:37:31,411
Yes, I am back.

312
00:37:34,141 --> 00:37:35,381
What happened?

313
00:37:36,481 --> 00:37:37,481
A miracle.

314
00:38:56,161 --> 00:38:57,161
Who are you?

315
00:38:58,031 --> 00:38:59,031
Is this...

316
00:38:59,931 --> 00:39:01,001
the afterlife?

317
00:39:01,531 --> 00:39:03,671
If you are worried you have died, do not be.

318
00:39:04,171 --> 00:39:06,031
You will be going back.

319
00:39:06,741 --> 00:39:07,741
But how?

320
00:39:08,771 --> 00:39:12,241
Have you ever heard of a human's final seven minutes?

321
00:39:13,141 --> 00:39:15,481
For about seven minutes, after one's last breath,

322
00:39:15,981 --> 00:39:17,811
the soul remains in the body...

323
00:39:18,211 --> 00:39:20,751
and relives the happiest moment of that life.

324
00:39:21,381 --> 00:39:23,221
During those final seven minutes,

325
00:39:24,651 --> 00:39:26,521
you prayed for only one thing.

326
00:39:30,291 --> 00:39:32,531
He died trying to save me,

327
00:39:33,301 --> 00:39:38,201
and once again, I did nothing. All I have ever done is take.

328
00:39:45,011 --> 00:39:46,281
My dear.

329
00:39:57,521 --> 00:39:58,691
I love you,

330
00:39:59,591 --> 00:40:00,591
Park Dal.

331
00:40:22,511 --> 00:40:23,611
I want to stay longer.

332
00:40:25,681 --> 00:40:27,481
By your radiant side,

333
00:40:29,421 --> 00:40:30,721
I want to stay for a long time.

334
00:40:37,761 --> 00:40:40,401
The desperation in your heart during your final moments...

335
00:40:41,201 --> 00:40:43,201
and that woman's desperate heart...

336
00:40:44,001 --> 00:40:46,171
revived the dying flower of your shared fate.

337
00:40:47,671 --> 00:40:50,671
There is a finite amount of everything in the world.

338
00:40:51,071 --> 00:40:52,771
Why would a bond between two people be any different?

339
00:40:53,241 --> 00:40:55,411
Your bond, severed for the past five years...

340
00:40:57,211 --> 00:40:58,851
It is time you reclaimed it.

341
00:41:01,351 --> 00:41:02,421
Why are you...

342
00:41:05,291 --> 00:41:07,161
granting me this miracle?

343
00:41:07,621 --> 00:41:08,721
All I did...

344
00:41:09,731 --> 00:41:12,431
was seal that woman's red thread of fate.

345
00:41:13,131 --> 00:41:14,831
And the one who swapped our bodies...

346
00:41:16,531 --> 00:41:17,771
was you, sir?

347
00:41:18,231 --> 00:41:20,101
That, too, was your own doing.

348
00:41:21,341 --> 00:41:23,871
The red thread of fate, desperately longing for its half,

349
00:41:24,741 --> 00:41:27,081
was a desperate cry for you to recognise each other,

350
00:41:27,641 --> 00:41:28,781
and a cry of resentment.

351
00:41:30,611 --> 00:41:32,751
Resentment?

352
00:41:37,191 --> 00:41:39,621
That woman tried to drown herself,

353
00:41:40,391 --> 00:41:42,621
and you tried to kill yourself with poison.

354
00:41:44,231 --> 00:41:45,831
The body switch,

355
00:41:46,301 --> 00:41:48,161
the breaking of the seal on the red thread of fate,

356
00:41:48,461 --> 00:41:51,501
and destroying the thread that had tangled your destiny.

357
00:41:52,941 --> 00:41:54,571
It was all your doing.

358
00:41:55,301 --> 00:41:57,511
Your love for each other conquered all.

359
00:41:58,371 --> 00:42:00,741
So, what all these miracles have built up to create...

360
00:42:03,711 --> 00:42:04,811
is destiny.

361
00:42:06,481 --> 00:42:07,851
So, go back now.

362
00:42:08,421 --> 00:42:10,451
To your fated one. No.

363
00:42:11,621 --> 00:42:13,021
To your miracle.

364
00:42:40,981 --> 00:42:41,981
Yes.

365
00:42:42,581 --> 00:42:43,591
I am back.

366
00:42:46,151 --> 00:42:47,561
What happened?

367
00:42:48,661 --> 00:42:49,661
A miracle.

368
00:42:51,231 --> 00:42:52,261
A seven-minute miracle.

369
00:42:55,601 --> 00:42:57,101
Once the seal on the thread of fate was broken,

370
00:42:57,871 --> 00:42:59,271
everything returned to its rightful place.

371
00:43:02,441 --> 00:43:05,411
My body, the rest of Dal's memories,

372
00:43:05,871 --> 00:43:06,881
and my title.

373
00:43:07,281 --> 00:43:09,141
Everything fell back into its rightful place.

374
00:43:09,481 --> 00:43:10,981
Here.

375
00:43:14,451 --> 00:43:17,151
There you go. Look at you, eating so well.

376
00:43:17,591 --> 00:43:18,591
Is it good?

377
00:43:21,891 --> 00:43:26,161
But am I really allowed to stay here in the Eastern Palace?

378
00:43:26,431 --> 00:43:30,171
Well, with Kim Deok Chun's confession, your name is cleared,

379
00:43:30,401 --> 00:43:33,201
and you are now the Crown Princess. What is the problem?

380
00:43:34,201 --> 00:43:37,711
Stay here until your room is ready. Got it?

381
00:43:47,881 --> 00:43:49,481
You are eating so well.

382
00:43:49,851 --> 00:43:51,621
Is it good? Oh, dear.

383
00:44:08,041 --> 00:44:09,201
Why are you here?

384
00:44:14,011 --> 00:44:15,481
I confessed.

385
00:44:16,141 --> 00:44:17,211
My crimes,

386
00:44:18,351 --> 00:44:20,921
the Left State Councillor's crimes, and everything.

387
00:44:21,781 --> 00:44:24,151
For years, while my mother was held hostage,

388
00:44:24,851 --> 00:44:26,921
I lived like a dog for the Left State Councillor.

389
00:44:28,761 --> 00:44:29,761
But now,

390
00:44:30,861 --> 00:44:32,561
I intend to live the rest of my days as a person.

391
00:44:33,831 --> 00:44:36,261
That is the only way, even in death,

392
00:44:36,331 --> 00:44:38,931
I will be able to face my mother with my head held high.

393
00:44:42,201 --> 00:44:43,211
I am sorry...

394
00:44:43,771 --> 00:44:44,771
for dragging you into this.

395
00:44:53,081 --> 00:44:54,621
For ruining your life.

396
00:44:56,021 --> 00:44:57,521
Saying "I am sorry" feels so inadequate.

397
00:44:59,491 --> 00:45:00,491
But I am so sorry.

398
00:45:01,161 --> 00:45:02,161
Thanks to you, my lady,

399
00:45:02,761 --> 00:45:05,131
I was at least able to get my mother some medicine.

400
00:45:06,601 --> 00:45:09,701
For me, that is more than enough.

401
00:45:22,881 --> 00:45:24,351
Those criminals!

402
00:45:24,381 --> 00:45:25,611
- Those godforsaken scoundrels!
- You jerks!

403
00:45:25,881 --> 00:45:28,521
- They are not even human!
- Those jerks!

404
00:45:30,191 --> 00:45:31,821
The wicked were punished.

405
00:45:40,131 --> 00:45:41,201
I apologise.

406
00:45:45,731 --> 00:45:46,741
Truly...

407
00:45:50,571 --> 00:45:51,741
I am so sorry.

408
00:45:53,381 --> 00:45:55,981
Had you only been cruel to me, I might have forgiven you.

409
00:45:58,351 --> 00:46:00,381
But for the pain you caused my son,

410
00:46:02,621 --> 00:46:04,321
I can never forgive you.

411
00:46:06,721 --> 00:46:07,721
I...

412
00:46:10,891 --> 00:46:11,961
will spend the rest of my life...

413
00:46:20,471 --> 00:46:21,901
in repentance.

414
00:46:26,781 --> 00:46:28,711
The guilty repented,

415
00:46:31,651 --> 00:46:32,981
and the end for the wicked...

416
00:46:34,481 --> 00:46:36,221
was pathetic beyond measure.

417
00:46:38,551 --> 00:46:41,121
By Royal Command, the traitor Kim Han Chul's assets will be taken.

418
00:46:41,661 --> 00:46:43,731
- Begin!
- Yes, Your Highness!

419
00:46:44,261 --> 00:46:46,531
- Search everywhere!
- Leave no stone unturned!

420
00:46:51,901 --> 00:46:52,901
Your Royal Highness.

421
00:47:01,241 --> 00:47:02,611
What is with all these medical books?

422
00:47:05,051 --> 00:47:07,051
They are about madness and Jimjo poison.

423
00:47:09,221 --> 00:47:10,791
It seems the Left State Councillor wrote them himself.

424
00:47:11,721 --> 00:47:13,821
Your Royal Highness, I found more over here.

425
00:47:16,961 --> 00:47:17,961
I imagine...

426
00:47:19,361 --> 00:47:21,431
he wrote all of this for only one woman.

427
00:48:01,741 --> 00:48:04,011
I told you to get some more rest.

428
00:48:04,441 --> 00:48:05,911
What if your wound gets worse?

429
00:48:06,741 --> 00:48:09,611
I am going stir-crazy just lying around.

430
00:48:10,481 --> 00:48:12,051
What have you been up to, Your Royal Highness?

431
00:48:14,951 --> 00:48:16,381
I went to the Left State Councillor's house.

432
00:48:16,921 --> 00:48:18,221
To seize his property.

433
00:48:18,721 --> 00:48:21,591
Why? Did something happen?

434
00:48:24,831 --> 00:48:25,861
The Left State Councillor...

435
00:48:26,431 --> 00:48:28,231
was an enigma to the very end.

436
00:48:29,331 --> 00:48:32,131
There were dozens of medical texts on madness and Jimjo Poison.

437
00:48:33,671 --> 00:48:36,541
After searching high and low for every possible cure,

438
00:48:37,341 --> 00:48:39,041
he ended up turning to poison.

439
00:48:39,471 --> 00:48:40,481
How ironic.

440
00:48:42,081 --> 00:48:43,681
The secret pact was in the mirror,

441
00:48:44,151 --> 00:48:45,981
and the reason he kept a mirror by his bedside...

442
00:48:46,381 --> 00:48:48,551
was a superstition about calling back a spirit.

443
00:48:49,481 --> 00:48:51,091
The talisman inside the mirror...

444
00:48:51,591 --> 00:48:53,361
must have been his desperate wish also.

445
00:48:54,161 --> 00:48:56,291
He must have been desperate to try anything.

446
00:48:58,061 --> 00:49:00,201
Desperate enough to grab onto...

447
00:49:01,031 --> 00:49:02,261
the coattails of skies and beg.

448
00:49:03,001 --> 00:49:04,401
That is how he must have felt.

449
00:49:05,371 --> 00:49:07,641
Just as my last five years were consumed by revenge,

450
00:49:08,301 --> 00:49:10,241
the Left State Councillor's time must have been just as intense.

451
00:49:13,271 --> 00:49:16,111
If you had not been by my side,

452
00:49:16,711 --> 00:49:18,111
I might have become a monster.

453
00:49:20,681 --> 00:49:22,151
That will never happen to you now.

454
00:49:23,991 --> 00:49:24,991
Gosh.

455
00:49:25,951 --> 00:49:28,461
Because I will be by your side forever.

456
00:49:32,591 --> 00:49:34,331
Speaking of the Left State Councillor...

457
00:49:34,701 --> 00:49:37,001
What happened with Grand Prince Je Un and U Hui?

458
00:49:37,271 --> 00:49:38,271
Well...

459
00:50:02,191 --> 00:50:03,661
I am sorry I am so late.

460
00:50:04,261 --> 00:50:05,261
I am sorry.

461
00:50:06,161 --> 00:50:07,161
Let us go now.

462
00:50:13,001 --> 00:50:14,371
I am not going.

463
00:50:16,001 --> 00:50:17,011
I will...

464
00:50:18,141 --> 00:50:19,771
atone for my sins alone.

465
00:50:21,841 --> 00:50:25,311
If it is because you feel guilty, His Royal Highness has forgiven you.

466
00:50:25,381 --> 00:50:28,381
Even His Majesty has allowed us to run away together.

467
00:50:30,251 --> 00:50:32,751
You were finally reunited with the mother you missed dearly.

468
00:50:36,561 --> 00:50:37,991
Please stay by your mother's side.

469
00:50:41,761 --> 00:50:42,761
Are you telling me...

470
00:50:44,501 --> 00:50:46,071
to abandon you all over again?

471
00:50:47,571 --> 00:50:49,401
I am not asking you to abandon me.

472
00:50:51,341 --> 00:50:53,581
I am asking you to honour my love.

473
00:50:54,741 --> 00:50:55,741
Let me be the one...

474
00:50:56,581 --> 00:50:58,881
to protect myself.

475
00:51:00,681 --> 00:51:01,951
If we leave like this,

476
00:51:02,821 --> 00:51:05,451
if I see even a hint of sadness on your face one day,

477
00:51:09,691 --> 00:51:11,931
I will end up hating myself.

478
00:51:13,231 --> 00:51:15,361
If you so much as sigh,

479
00:51:16,231 --> 00:51:17,831
I will fall apart.

480
00:51:19,431 --> 00:51:20,801
When you smile,

481
00:51:21,801 --> 00:51:23,541
I will wonder if you are hiding your sorrow,

482
00:51:27,811 --> 00:51:29,681
and my own heart will grow dark.

483
00:51:30,981 --> 00:51:32,880
I will always be walking on eggshells around you...

484
00:51:32,881 --> 00:51:33,921
until, in the end,

485
00:51:35,051 --> 00:51:37,351
I will not be able to stand the sight of myself.

486
00:51:40,051 --> 00:51:41,891
I do not want that kind of future.

487
00:51:44,161 --> 00:51:45,161
U Hui.

488
00:51:59,011 --> 00:52:01,781
Just as your desire to protect me is love,

489
00:52:03,341 --> 00:52:05,951
my desire to protect you...

490
00:52:10,421 --> 00:52:11,651
is also love.

491
00:52:31,571 --> 00:52:32,811
Will you be all right?

492
00:52:33,071 --> 00:52:34,541
Letting the Left State Councillor's daughter go like that?

493
00:52:35,041 --> 00:52:38,181
I have not let her go. I am taking my mother and following her.

494
00:52:38,311 --> 00:52:39,351
Not just to Yeongdeok,

495
00:52:39,611 --> 00:52:41,851
but to the fiery pits, if I have to.

496
00:52:45,151 --> 00:52:46,451
That sounds hot.

497
00:52:46,891 --> 00:52:48,691
Could it be any hotter than the fire in my heart?

498
00:52:49,921 --> 00:52:50,931
Even so,

499
00:52:52,161 --> 00:52:54,331
could you be more passionate than the Crown Princess and I?

500
00:53:07,481 --> 00:53:08,481
It is in!

501
00:53:31,271 --> 00:53:34,441
I am holding my bow. Got it? So do not try anything funny.

502
00:53:34,771 --> 00:53:36,641
Anything funny? Like what?

503
00:53:37,211 --> 00:53:38,241
Like this?

504
00:53:38,741 --> 00:53:39,771
For goodness' sake.

505
00:53:40,411 --> 00:53:42,141
- Gosh.
- Hey!

506
00:53:43,141 --> 00:53:45,281
What are you doing? There are people watching.

507
00:53:46,851 --> 00:53:48,821
Are you asking me to take you somewhere more private?

508
00:53:49,121 --> 00:53:51,351
- That is what you meant, right?
- No!

509
00:53:53,051 --> 00:53:54,061
No.

510
00:53:54,591 --> 00:53:56,491
- Come on.
- No.

511
00:53:57,061 --> 00:53:59,231
When did I ever say that?

512
00:54:26,521 --> 00:54:29,421
You have not even been at your desk for 15 minutes.

513
00:54:31,991 --> 00:54:35,161
- I cannot even hold your hand?
- If you hold my hand,

514
00:54:38,171 --> 00:54:40,571
you will just use it as an excuse to run off again.

515
00:54:42,141 --> 00:54:44,911
- I do not care. Let us go.
- If you keep this up,

516
00:54:45,541 --> 00:54:46,871
I am going to start cooking.

517
00:54:58,421 --> 00:54:59,851
Why is that a threat?

518
00:55:04,361 --> 00:55:06,261
This hits the spot!

519
00:55:11,101 --> 00:55:12,101
Wait.

520
00:55:12,571 --> 00:55:14,601
Why have you not been eating much lately?

521
00:55:15,801 --> 00:55:18,511
I think I have an upset stomach. It just does not feel right...

522
00:55:20,211 --> 00:55:22,241
Wait, are you sick?

523
00:55:22,581 --> 00:55:23,711
Are you all right?

524
00:55:26,511 --> 00:55:28,681
- If she is sick...
- It cannot be.

525
00:55:30,021 --> 00:55:31,321
She is pregnant!

526
00:55:43,661 --> 00:55:46,771
What is taking so long? Has something gone wrong?

527
00:55:47,501 --> 00:55:50,201
A first labour is always the most difficult.

528
00:55:57,251 --> 00:55:59,981
- Your Highness.
- I see the head! Push harder!

529
00:56:00,281 --> 00:56:02,981
Your Highness, you have to breathe.

530
00:56:06,251 --> 00:56:09,721
Why are we not switching bodies now?

531
00:56:10,121 --> 00:56:11,561
Just a little more!

532
00:56:11,631 --> 00:56:13,731
Just one more time. Your Highness, just one more push.

533
00:56:16,861 --> 00:56:18,501
Crown Princess!

534
00:56:21,071 --> 00:56:23,441
It is the firstborn prince, Your Royal Highness.

535
00:56:29,081 --> 00:56:30,081
I am so sorry.

536
00:56:31,411 --> 00:56:32,411
I am so sorry.

537
00:56:33,081 --> 00:56:35,721
You were in so much pain. I am so sorry.

538
00:56:43,291 --> 00:56:44,761
My seven minutes...

539
00:56:45,791 --> 00:56:47,701
has been renewed.

540
00:56:55,501 --> 00:56:57,101
I do not think seven minutes...

541
00:56:59,811 --> 00:57:01,181
will be enough.

542
00:57:09,521 --> 00:57:11,121
(5 years later)

543
00:57:11,191 --> 00:57:14,191
This king will abolish the practice of guilt by association.

544
00:57:14,521 --> 00:57:18,561
- Your Majesty, you must not!
- Please retract the royal order!

545
00:57:18,861 --> 00:57:21,861
- Please retract the royal order!
- Please retract the royal order!

546
00:57:24,071 --> 00:57:25,071
Of course.

547
00:57:25,571 --> 00:57:28,871
It would not be a proper assembly without some opposition, would it?

548
00:57:31,611 --> 00:57:32,611
However,

549
00:57:34,441 --> 00:57:35,681
this king will proceed.

550
00:57:36,341 --> 00:57:38,751
Losing your life for a crime you did not commit...

551
00:57:39,111 --> 00:57:41,681
or becoming a government slave is simply too unjust.

552
00:57:42,221 --> 00:57:44,221
- But Your Majesty...
- From this day forward, Joseon...

553
00:57:44,651 --> 00:57:46,451
will be a nation where people are not defined by their birth,

554
00:57:46,891 --> 00:57:50,491
but by how they choose to live their lives.

555
00:57:51,761 --> 00:57:54,701
Abolishing guilt by association is the first step toward that future.

556
00:57:55,901 --> 00:57:58,201
- Yes, Your Majesty!
- Yes, Your Majesty!

557
00:58:33,631 --> 00:58:34,871
I can do that, you know.

558
00:58:35,441 --> 00:58:37,141
This is a secret,

559
00:58:37,911 --> 00:58:40,441
but I am actually an expert at hanging laundry.

560
00:58:42,911 --> 00:58:45,611
It feels like I have been seeing you more often lately.

561
00:58:46,011 --> 00:58:47,421
I want to see you every day.

562
00:58:58,361 --> 00:58:59,631
Six years have passed.

563
00:59:00,261 --> 00:59:03,461
Can I now offer you a wedding gift?

564
00:59:07,501 --> 00:59:10,241
- My mind has not changed.
- But our circumstances have.

565
00:59:12,371 --> 00:59:13,671
My brother No.

566
00:59:14,311 --> 00:59:17,511
His Majesty has promised to grant you your freedom soon.

567
00:59:19,111 --> 00:59:22,581
He said you will be adopted by one of your relatives.

568
00:59:23,821 --> 00:59:24,851
So,

569
00:59:30,191 --> 00:59:32,391
will you accept my proposal now?

570
00:59:56,721 --> 01:00:00,121
Hey, now! Be careful, you lot!

571
01:00:00,521 --> 01:00:02,220
These goods are for the palace.

572
01:00:02,221 --> 01:00:03,591
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

573
01:00:03,661 --> 01:00:05,660
The Crown Prince is very particular.

574
01:00:05,661 --> 01:00:07,661
He is as demanding as His Majesty.

575
01:00:07,731 --> 01:00:12,001
Be careful, and careful. My goodness!

576
01:00:12,071 --> 01:00:13,831
My goodness. My lord.

577
01:00:14,201 --> 01:00:17,001
Have you been well? So you are the head merchant now.

578
01:00:17,341 --> 01:00:18,441
Of course!

579
01:00:18,911 --> 01:00:21,341
It has been six years already.

580
01:00:21,441 --> 01:00:23,741
So what brings you to Hanyang?

581
01:00:23,841 --> 01:00:25,481
I had heard you went down to Yeongdeok.

582
01:00:25,881 --> 01:00:28,581
Oh, I am back now.

583
01:00:28,681 --> 01:00:31,391
And I am here to buy a few goods.

584
01:00:31,451 --> 01:00:34,391
Goods? Are you looking for anything in particular?

585
01:00:36,421 --> 01:00:37,531
Well...

586
01:00:39,791 --> 01:00:43,231
Come on, at your age, what is there to be shy about?

587
01:00:45,131 --> 01:00:47,571
Our master is getting married.

588
01:00:48,701 --> 01:00:49,871
Wonderful!

589
01:00:50,371 --> 01:00:52,111
He is here to shop for the wedding.

590
01:00:52,271 --> 01:00:55,140
What wonderful news!

591
01:00:55,141 --> 01:00:56,141
Everyone!

592
01:00:56,241 --> 01:00:59,381
Bring out every single one of our finest new arrivals!

593
01:00:59,411 --> 01:01:00,451
- Yes, sir!
- Yes, sir!

594
01:01:02,521 --> 01:01:04,751
- Thank you.
- Congratulations, my lord.

595
01:01:37,651 --> 01:01:39,191
You have not changed a bit, my dear.

596
01:01:53,431 --> 01:01:56,201
I mean, you could have just said that from over there.

597
01:01:56,801 --> 01:01:59,471
Well, you should not have called me that, then.

598
01:01:59,711 --> 01:02:02,541
It just slipped out.

599
01:02:09,051 --> 01:02:10,051
This...

600
01:02:10,381 --> 01:02:12,991
is because you called me "my dear."

601
01:02:15,491 --> 01:02:17,091
That came out of nowhere.

602
01:02:18,531 --> 01:02:19,531
Then...

603
01:02:20,091 --> 01:02:23,531
how about we make a little context, my lady?

604
01:03:09,181 --> 01:03:10,681
As if being alone was not sad enough,

605
01:03:11,611 --> 01:03:12,881
it has to rain too.

606
01:03:13,751 --> 01:03:15,051
I am so lonely.

607
01:03:16,381 --> 01:03:17,421
Hang in there.

608
01:03:18,521 --> 01:03:19,521
I am alone too.

609
01:03:26,391 --> 01:03:27,561
Hey, what are you doing?

610
01:03:27,631 --> 01:03:30,031
What is wrong? Do not be so serious.

611
01:03:30,501 --> 01:03:32,801
- Come on, what is the big deal?
- Court Lady Hong.

612
01:03:33,601 --> 01:03:35,701
- What are they...
- Please stop!

613
01:03:36,201 --> 01:03:38,541
Those thugs are harassing Court Lady Hong!

614
01:03:41,911 --> 01:03:44,310
Hey, you! Knock it off!

615
01:03:44,311 --> 01:03:46,811
How dare you! Stop right there!

616
01:03:50,451 --> 01:03:52,551
How dare they! Do they not know I am Se Dol?

617
01:03:56,791 --> 01:03:58,761
Court Lady Hong, are you all right?

618
01:04:14,841 --> 01:04:15,941
Are you all right?

619
01:04:17,951 --> 01:04:20,481
Thank you for saving me.

620
01:04:29,391 --> 01:04:30,761
But I am the one who saved her.

621
01:04:34,701 --> 01:04:36,531
I guess I will have to be reborn.

622
01:04:42,041 --> 01:04:45,341
You look much better since your abdication, Your Majesty.

623
01:04:46,011 --> 01:04:49,211
Even silk robes and leather shoes are useless if they do not fit.

624
01:04:49,841 --> 01:04:51,311
And that is even more true for one's position.

625
01:04:53,981 --> 01:04:55,551
Here, this is for you.

626
01:04:57,451 --> 01:04:59,791
Thank you, Royal Grandfather.

627
01:05:01,861 --> 01:05:03,491
What is wrong? Do you not like it?

628
01:05:04,061 --> 01:05:05,761
No, it is not that.

629
01:05:06,591 --> 01:05:09,261
Actually, my Royal Father scolded me.

630
01:05:09,701 --> 01:05:10,701
Why?

631
01:05:11,331 --> 01:05:13,700
He was mad I split personal colours into eight...

632
01:05:13,701 --> 01:05:15,901
instead of studying.

633
01:05:18,771 --> 01:05:21,111
H has forgotten he was once a tadpole himself.

634
01:05:21,441 --> 01:05:23,381
Your father is that very frog.

635
01:05:23,741 --> 01:05:25,551
How about I make you a frog?

636
01:05:26,011 --> 01:05:27,581
- Yes, please!
- Okay.

637
01:05:27,781 --> 01:05:29,121
I will make you one right now.

638
01:05:36,091 --> 01:05:37,291
Goodness.

639
01:05:42,001 --> 01:05:43,261
There we go.

640
01:05:44,061 --> 01:05:45,171
Gosh.

641
01:05:46,531 --> 01:05:49,271
My goodness, you really love that thing.

642
01:05:49,441 --> 01:05:50,901
You seem to smile more...

643
01:05:50,971 --> 01:05:53,041
at those jars than at your husband.

644
01:05:53,171 --> 01:05:56,311
This kimchi is six years old.

645
01:05:56,981 --> 01:05:58,081
And?

646
01:05:59,011 --> 01:06:01,321
It means for six years, we have not had to run away.

647
01:06:01,381 --> 01:06:04,751
This jar is living proof that we have lived in peace.

648
01:06:04,821 --> 01:06:07,620
Oh, do not make such a fuss over six years.

649
01:06:07,621 --> 01:06:08,691
Just you wait.

650
01:06:08,791 --> 01:06:11,191
We will be eating kimchi aged for a thousand years to come.

651
01:06:11,461 --> 01:06:13,391
Oh, please. We would be dead by then.

652
01:06:13,631 --> 01:06:16,901
Goodness, you really know how to kill the mood.

653
01:06:16,961 --> 01:06:18,900
Maybe it is from all our past crises.

654
01:06:18,901 --> 01:06:21,201
I do not have time for mood.

655
01:06:27,041 --> 01:06:29,511
There will not be any more crises from now on,

656
01:06:30,081 --> 01:06:31,281
so you just trust me.

657
01:06:32,251 --> 01:06:34,351
I have been Unjeong Palace's steward for six years now.

658
01:06:35,551 --> 01:06:37,051
You think I cannot protect my own wife?

659
01:06:40,051 --> 01:06:41,991
Oh, honestly. Goodness.

660
01:06:42,821 --> 01:06:45,591
Anyway, where is Hong Nan? She went there again?

661
01:06:56,841 --> 01:06:57,841
My lord.

662
01:06:59,341 --> 01:07:01,211
I have kept my promise.

663
01:07:02,711 --> 01:07:04,381
Are you at peace now?

664
01:07:05,951 --> 01:07:06,951
And just like that,

665
01:07:07,551 --> 01:07:09,121
we have been apart longer...

666
01:07:09,781 --> 01:07:12,051
than we were ever together.

667
01:07:14,321 --> 01:07:15,321
So,

668
01:07:16,321 --> 01:07:17,861
if there is a next life,

669
01:07:20,261 --> 01:07:22,731
let us be together...

670
01:07:23,961 --> 01:07:25,331
for a long time.

671
01:07:29,441 --> 01:07:30,441
Goodness.

672
01:07:47,621 --> 01:07:48,821
Royal Mother.

673
01:07:52,761 --> 01:07:53,761
Yul.

674
01:07:54,331 --> 01:07:57,431
You know what? If you catch a falling petal,

675
01:07:57,801 --> 01:07:59,271
they say your first love will come true.

676
01:07:59,901 --> 01:08:02,771
Then I am going to marry you, Royal Mother.

677
01:08:03,301 --> 01:08:04,371
Marry me?

678
01:08:06,941 --> 01:08:09,441
Well, well. Freeze.

679
01:08:09,781 --> 01:08:12,051
- Royal Father!
- Come over here.

680
01:08:12,511 --> 01:08:16,081
Give me that. This petal is hereby confiscated.

681
01:08:16,451 --> 01:08:18,551
- Got it?
- But why?

682
01:08:19,851 --> 01:08:21,891
Now, listen closely.

683
01:08:22,291 --> 01:08:25,431
Your mother is already married to me.

684
01:08:25,891 --> 01:08:26,891
Therefore,

685
01:08:29,631 --> 01:08:31,031
she is mine.

686
01:08:32,431 --> 01:08:33,431
All right?

687
01:08:36,441 --> 01:08:38,711
No! I do not care!

688
01:08:38,971 --> 01:08:40,441
- What?
- I do not care!

689
01:08:40,511 --> 01:08:42,011
- I do not care!
- You do not care? Too bad.

690
01:08:42,211 --> 01:08:44,311
You do not care? Too bad.

691
01:08:45,411 --> 01:08:48,081
I do not care!

692
01:08:48,351 --> 01:08:51,421
- Goodness, you. You do not care?
- I do not care!

693
01:08:53,551 --> 01:08:55,861
Your Majesty, why are you making him cry again?

694
01:08:55,921 --> 01:08:57,191
But this is all...

695
01:08:57,491 --> 01:09:00,361
- your fault, my Queen.
- Oh, so it is my fault again?

696
01:09:00,531 --> 01:09:03,331
Whose fault is it then? Who told you to be so beautiful...

697
01:09:03,801 --> 01:09:06,671
- to divide a father and son?
- Oh, honestly.

698
01:09:07,131 --> 01:09:10,041
Shall we go? Let us go. Come on.

699
01:09:51,111 --> 01:09:52,581
What a beautiful day.

700
01:09:52,951 --> 01:09:53,951
It really is.

701
01:09:58,121 --> 01:09:59,121
Look over there.

702
01:10:03,361 --> 01:10:05,291
I was really startled.

703
01:10:07,631 --> 01:10:10,201
You are not afraid of water anymore, are you?

704
01:10:11,931 --> 01:10:12,931
Water?

705
01:10:14,301 --> 01:10:15,501
Afraid of it?

706
01:10:16,141 --> 01:10:17,171
I am grateful for it.

707
01:10:18,071 --> 01:10:19,611
It is what brought you back to me.

708
01:10:27,811 --> 01:10:29,721
What are you looking at over there?

709
01:10:30,251 --> 01:10:32,221
You should only be looking at me. Like this.

710
01:10:32,891 --> 01:10:33,891
Okay?

711
01:10:34,961 --> 01:10:35,991
The water.

712
01:10:39,061 --> 01:10:42,461
And our reflection, flowing with it.

713
01:11:02,121 --> 01:11:03,121
I cannot.

714
01:11:16,261 --> 01:11:17,361
Arrest him!

715
01:11:17,831 --> 01:11:19,271
No!

716
01:12:02,181 --> 01:12:03,211
That water...

717
01:12:03,911 --> 01:12:07,251
must remember all our time together, do you not think?

718
01:12:10,151 --> 01:12:13,651
Then I suppose that water had better have a good memory.

719
01:12:15,391 --> 01:12:16,521
Because our story...

720
01:12:17,391 --> 01:12:20,561
is going to be a very long one.

721
01:12:24,401 --> 01:12:25,601
Even if you...

722
01:12:26,271 --> 01:12:27,931
lose your memory all over again,

723
01:12:29,771 --> 01:12:31,441
even if I were to die again,

724
01:12:32,411 --> 01:12:35,511
or whatever else stands in our way,

725
01:12:36,211 --> 01:12:37,481
I will conquer it all.

726
01:12:42,051 --> 01:12:45,591
And we will live happily for a long time.

727
01:12:47,291 --> 01:12:48,291
Me too.

728
01:12:49,961 --> 01:12:53,461
Come what may, I will not make any excuses.

729
01:12:54,291 --> 01:12:56,901
I will spend my life by your side, Your Majesty.

730
01:12:57,701 --> 01:13:00,401
And I will hold on to you forever and ever.

731
01:13:05,841 --> 01:13:07,511
- Again?
