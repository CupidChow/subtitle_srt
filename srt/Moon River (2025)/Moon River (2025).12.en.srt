1
00:00:09,050 --> 00:00:10,380
(All people, incidents, and backgrounds...)

2
00:00:10,450 --> 00:00:11,680
(in this drama are fictitious and unrelated to reality.)

3
00:00:11,750 --> 00:00:13,790
(Also, children and animals were filmed under production guidelines.)

4
00:00:16,590 --> 00:00:17,590
I...

5
00:00:20,090 --> 00:00:21,590
must have caught two.

6
00:00:25,460 --> 00:00:26,530
After all, my first love and I...

7
00:00:30,570 --> 00:00:33,140
ended up married twice.

8
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:44,720
I...

9
00:00:45,650 --> 00:00:47,080
I am so sorry.

10
00:00:54,260 --> 00:00:55,390
At a time like this,

11
00:00:56,660 --> 00:00:57,730
you should not be on your knees.

12
00:00:58,300 --> 00:00:59,800
You should be holding me.

13
00:01:11,210 --> 00:01:12,740
Like you will never let go.

14
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:46,110
The river water must have been freezing.

15
00:01:48,110 --> 00:01:50,780
Your life must have been equally cold after that.

16
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:53,020
I am truly sorry.

17
00:01:55,620 --> 00:01:58,860
I lived better than you think, Your Royal Highness.

18
00:02:01,190 --> 00:02:02,490
I laughed often.

19
00:02:03,530 --> 00:02:05,800
And there were times I was so happy I could barely breathe.

20
00:02:07,270 --> 00:02:09,770
I, Park Dal, lived a pretty wonderful life.

21
00:02:10,070 --> 00:02:11,470
So when you pity me like this,

22
00:02:11,940 --> 00:02:13,400
what does that make my last five years?

23
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:15,040
A life is a life, however short.

24
00:02:15,540 --> 00:02:16,540
No.

25
00:02:17,810 --> 00:02:18,980
It is not pity.

26
00:02:20,750 --> 00:02:22,050
I am just so very sorry.

27
00:02:23,510 --> 00:02:25,820
And please stop speaking to me so formally.

28
00:02:26,150 --> 00:02:27,150
It is awkward.

29
00:02:27,750 --> 00:02:30,250
How can I go back to speaking to you so casually?

30
00:02:30,820 --> 00:02:32,890
Do not treat me like Crown Princess Gang Yeon Wol.

31
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:35,060
Treat me like Park Dal.

32
00:02:35,660 --> 00:02:36,760
Just like you always have.

33
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:40,330
It is not as if all my memories have returned.

34
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:42,100
And compared to that hazy past,

35
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,870
the five years I lived as Park Dal feel so much more real.

36
00:02:46,970 --> 00:02:48,810
- But... - Besides,

37
00:02:49,610 --> 00:02:51,910
what if someone were to hear you?

38
00:02:51,910 --> 00:02:54,210
We must be careful, for both of us.

39
00:02:59,020 --> 00:03:00,050
Okay?

40
00:03:05,890 --> 00:03:07,190
You were right beside me,

41
00:03:07,790 --> 00:03:09,490
and I was too foolish not to recognise you.

42
00:03:10,290 --> 00:03:13,230
What right do I have to argue? From now on,

43
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:16,130
everything will be as you wish, Dal.

44
00:03:19,100 --> 00:03:20,100
But...

45
00:03:21,540 --> 00:03:23,810
I am suddenly curious about something.

46
00:03:25,540 --> 00:03:27,110
Is it Gang Yeon Wol?

47
00:03:27,610 --> 00:03:28,610
Or Park Dal?

48
00:03:29,480 --> 00:03:30,480
Well...

49
00:03:30,850 --> 00:03:33,880
- What are you... - Come on.

50
00:03:34,190 --> 00:03:35,820
I am just asking.

51
00:03:35,850 --> 00:03:37,090
Which one of us do you like more?

52
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:40,590
And for the record, you cannot say both.

53
00:03:41,930 --> 00:03:43,930
I mean, what kind of...

54
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:52,170
Is it that hard of a question?

55
00:03:55,070 --> 00:03:58,310
What right does a fool like me have to say anything?

56
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:00,610
I will do as you wish, Dal.

57
00:04:00,980 --> 00:04:02,180
Trying to weasel your way out of it?

58
00:04:04,620 --> 00:04:07,390
I am a fool. What right do I have?

59
00:04:07,750 --> 00:04:09,090
I will do as you wish, Dal.

60
00:04:11,420 --> 00:04:12,420
Are you okay?

61
00:04:14,730 --> 00:04:16,960
Oh, no. Are you hurt?

62
00:04:17,030 --> 00:04:19,700
Does a fool like me even have the right to be okay?

63
00:04:20,330 --> 00:04:21,630
I will do as you wish, Dal.

64
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:27,910
You scared me. Gosh.

65
00:04:33,140 --> 00:04:34,380
This fool...

66
00:04:35,650 --> 00:04:37,010
is going to do as he pleases just this once.

67
00:05:24,060 --> 00:05:25,100
Elder!

68
00:05:26,100 --> 00:05:27,200
Elder!

69
00:05:30,470 --> 00:05:31,840
What is this?

70
00:05:32,370 --> 00:05:34,040
When one red string of fate goes awry,

71
00:05:34,870 --> 00:05:37,310
the others are bound to follow.

72
00:05:38,180 --> 00:05:41,580
It seems that fool still has not given up.

73
00:05:42,550 --> 00:05:45,450
He does not even realise he is turning into a monster.

74
00:05:47,890 --> 00:05:49,250
Hong Nan of Eunwol Pavilion...

75
00:05:49,890 --> 00:05:54,160
asked me to tell the Head Eunuch she is with Yeon Wol of Gang family.

76
00:05:57,330 --> 00:05:59,300
Yeon Wol of the Gang family, you say?

77
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:04,700
I heard Hong Nan has an older brother.

78
00:06:05,470 --> 00:06:08,410
Is he that runaway eunuch?

79
00:06:09,310 --> 00:06:10,340
How could you know that?

80
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:18,520
(Life)

81
00:06:20,450 --> 00:06:24,520
I heard The Nameless tattoo themselves with "life."

82
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:33,130
Please save me.

83
00:06:33,730 --> 00:06:35,000
So, Your Highness,

84
00:06:35,670 --> 00:06:40,340
you must not be swayed by pity or curiosity.

85
00:06:42,140 --> 00:06:43,740
If his goal was to become the King's in-law,

86
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:46,740
he should have just killed me back in the Gyesa Year.

87
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:49,710
Rather than the Crown Princess,

88
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:53,750
it would have been far easier to kill the wife of a grand prince.

89
00:06:56,950 --> 00:06:58,190
The timing is strange too.

90
00:06:58,690 --> 00:07:00,790
- You must come with us. - Let go of me!

91
00:07:00,990 --> 00:07:03,430
Considering I was deposed not long after that,

92
00:07:03,930 --> 00:07:05,830
at my mother's grave that day,

93
00:07:06,730 --> 00:07:08,670
I must have seen something I should not have.

94
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:16,170
What in the world is on Mount Gamak?

95
00:07:18,810 --> 00:07:20,980
Your Highness, it is Yeon Sim.

96
00:07:21,580 --> 00:07:22,580
Come in.

97
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:29,920
I found a letter outside your chambers.

98
00:07:37,630 --> 00:07:41,300
(Chapter 12: The Woman in White)

99
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:43,200
Hey! What do you think you are doing, you brutes?

100
00:07:43,270 --> 00:07:47,500
Arrest the traitors who abandoned their posts and fled the palace!

101
00:07:47,610 --> 00:07:49,710
- Let me go, you scoundrel! - Open the door!

102
00:07:54,880 --> 00:07:56,480
- Arrest them! - Yes, sir!

103
00:07:56,550 --> 00:07:59,350
- Well, I knew this day would come. - My goodness.

104
00:07:59,420 --> 00:08:01,620
- Goodness! - That girl...

105
00:08:03,390 --> 00:08:04,390
Hong Nan!

106
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:06,060
Goodness! Hong Nan!

107
00:08:09,890 --> 00:08:14,400
You can try to cover the moon, but do you think you can hide?

108
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,600
Protect them.

109
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:54,840
For getting you both involved in this,

110
00:08:55,370 --> 00:08:56,540
I am deeply sorry.

111
00:08:57,240 --> 00:08:58,340
What are you talking about?

112
00:08:58,940 --> 00:09:00,240
We are the ones at fault.

113
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:02,810
- Why are you the one apologising? - That is right.

114
00:09:03,210 --> 00:09:07,120
Do not be silly. I may have been prickly,

115
00:09:09,890 --> 00:09:10,920
but I was sorry,

116
00:09:11,660 --> 00:09:13,190
and I was always grateful for you, Hong Nan.

117
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:19,430
My dear.

118
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,070
If by some chance...

119
00:09:21,870 --> 00:09:23,270
there is a next life,

120
00:09:25,370 --> 00:09:26,400
I hope you will...

121
00:09:27,100 --> 00:09:28,710
still find me one more time.

122
00:09:29,640 --> 00:09:34,240
I will be reborn a rich nobleman,

123
00:09:35,910 --> 00:09:39,180
and I will give you so much wealth, enough to build a mountain with it.

124
00:09:40,150 --> 00:09:41,150
Promise me...

125
00:09:42,590 --> 00:09:45,390
to find me one more time.

126
00:09:45,820 --> 00:09:46,820
Gosh.

127
00:09:48,730 --> 00:09:50,530
Meet again?

128
00:09:51,060 --> 00:09:52,730
But if we do happen to meet again,

129
00:09:54,870 --> 00:09:55,930
then I...

130
00:09:57,130 --> 00:10:00,470
will not raise my voice or lose my temper.

131
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:02,410
I will treat you right.

132
00:10:17,150 --> 00:10:18,160
Stop!

133
00:10:21,860 --> 00:10:22,860
Stop.

134
00:10:23,730 --> 00:10:24,830
Stop the execution!

135
00:10:28,100 --> 00:10:30,300
- What? - Dal. It is Dal.

136
00:10:34,670 --> 00:10:35,670
Out of my way.

137
00:10:53,490 --> 00:10:56,930
- Dal. - Father. Mother.

138
00:10:57,160 --> 00:10:59,200
- Auntie. - Dal.

139
00:10:59,230 --> 00:11:00,330
Is it you?

140
00:11:07,870 --> 00:11:10,810
By what authority did you sentence these people to death?

141
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:12,880
They are the fugitive Senior Court Lady and Eunuch.

142
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:14,680
And her crime is hiding the fugitives.

143
00:11:15,250 --> 00:11:16,250
Well,

144
00:11:18,050 --> 00:11:19,250
they are my family.

145
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:21,420
I will explain it all to His Majesty,

146
00:11:21,420 --> 00:11:22,450
so please stop the execution.

147
00:11:22,590 --> 00:11:23,990
That is not the answer.

148
00:11:26,190 --> 00:11:28,390
Reveal your true identity.

149
00:11:38,340 --> 00:11:39,740
If I answer that question,

150
00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:43,470
Dal!

151
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:47,140
will you let them go?

152
00:11:54,020 --> 00:11:55,450
What do you mean her true identity?

153
00:11:56,150 --> 00:11:57,290
She is Park Dal!

154
00:11:58,020 --> 00:11:59,820
You are and always will be...

155
00:12:00,220 --> 00:12:04,560
- Park Dal! - Right! We were on borrowed time.

156
00:12:04,930 --> 00:12:07,560
Five years felt like a dream, and that was enough for us.

157
00:12:08,430 --> 00:12:09,430
Dal.

158
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:12,800
Dal.

159
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:23,010
Having you with me...

160
00:12:24,250 --> 00:12:26,020
was the greatest gift, my daughter.

161
00:12:28,690 --> 00:12:29,820
I feel the same way.

162
00:12:31,160 --> 00:12:32,220
Our daughter.

163
00:12:33,860 --> 00:12:34,860
Do not cry.

164
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:36,790
Okay?

165
00:12:46,540 --> 00:12:47,840
Carry out the execution!

166
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:08,460
Stop!

167
00:13:14,700 --> 00:13:15,700
I am...

168
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,570
I am the Deposed Crown Princess Gang.

169
00:13:26,580 --> 00:13:27,580
The Deposed Crown Princess?

170
00:13:28,080 --> 00:13:29,250
The Deposed...

171
00:13:29,910 --> 00:13:31,010
The Deposed Crown Princess. Yes, it is her.

172
00:13:31,280 --> 00:13:32,920
Dal!

173
00:13:38,460 --> 00:13:41,560
What did you just say?

174
00:13:53,300 --> 00:13:55,310
- No! It is not true! - No!

175
00:13:55,370 --> 00:13:59,180
- Dal, no! - Dal, why are you doing this?

176
00:13:59,710 --> 00:14:01,040
Dal!

177
00:14:01,580 --> 00:14:03,680
- Dal! - Dal!

178
00:14:06,220 --> 00:14:07,420
Did you not hear me?

179
00:14:08,250 --> 00:14:09,690
I am the Deposed Crown Princess Gang.

180
00:14:23,430 --> 00:14:24,530
Gang Yeon Wol.

181
00:14:29,870 --> 00:14:31,140
Now that you have the answer you wanted,

182
00:14:32,680 --> 00:14:33,880
arrest me.

183
00:14:35,580 --> 00:14:36,810
Stop the execution.

184
00:14:37,510 --> 00:14:40,820
Arrest the criminal, the Deposed Crown Princess Gang.

185
00:14:41,450 --> 00:14:43,820
- Yes, sir! Arrest her! - Yes, sir!

186
00:14:43,820 --> 00:14:45,990
No!

187
00:14:46,460 --> 00:14:49,060
- Dal. - No...

188
00:14:49,530 --> 00:14:53,330
- Dal! - No! What are you doing?

189
00:14:54,730 --> 00:14:58,400
- No. Dal. - No!

190
00:14:58,470 --> 00:15:01,440
- No! Dal! - Dal!

191
00:15:01,540 --> 00:15:04,270
- Your Royal Highness! - Your Royal Highness!

192
00:15:04,340 --> 00:15:08,950
- Your Royal Highness! - Your Royal Highness!

193
00:15:55,730 --> 00:15:59,600
Your Majesty! The Deposed Crown Princess was to die.

194
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:01,630
For her to be alive is an act of high treason.

195
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,170
The Deposed Crown Princess disrespected the Royal Family.

196
00:16:04,670 --> 00:16:06,670
I implore you to order her execution!

197
00:16:07,070 --> 00:16:10,040
- Order her execution! - Order her execution!

198
00:16:10,870 --> 00:16:13,480
She dared to hide her identity and enter the palace,

199
00:16:13,710 --> 00:16:16,410
bringing contempt upon the Royal Family.

200
00:16:16,750 --> 00:16:19,880
I implore you to order her execution!

201
00:16:20,220 --> 00:16:22,790
- Order her execution! - Order her execution!

202
00:16:22,850 --> 00:16:25,590
You, of all people, know that Dal is innocent.

203
00:16:26,790 --> 00:16:27,890
Please help her.

204
00:16:28,690 --> 00:16:31,060
There is no way to prove the Crown Princess's innocence.

205
00:16:31,530 --> 00:16:34,330
Not unless the person who truly killed the Queen confesses.

206
00:16:35,030 --> 00:16:37,470
In the end, nothing has changed from five years ago.

207
00:16:38,440 --> 00:16:41,840
Then and now, you are what is most important to me.

208
00:16:46,110 --> 00:16:49,010
- Your Majesty! - Your Majesty!

209
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:54,990
The Royal Concubine, who defied my edict and escaped...

210
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:59,360
No, the Deposed Crown Princess Gang...

211
00:17:00,660 --> 00:17:01,930
is hereby sentenced to death by strangulation.

212
00:17:02,260 --> 00:17:06,700
- As you command, Your Majesty! - As you command, Your Majesty!

213
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:09,770
No, you cannot do this. You cannot do this, Your Majesty.

214
00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:12,940
Left Flank Guard and Eunuch Yoon,

215
00:17:12,940 --> 00:17:15,270
take the Crown Prince to his palace.

216
00:17:15,910 --> 00:17:18,980
- Yes, Your Majesty. - You cannot do this, Your Majesty!

217
00:17:19,510 --> 00:17:22,850
Let me go! Please do not do this!

218
00:17:23,110 --> 00:17:25,150
Please spare the Crown Princess's life!

219
00:17:25,480 --> 00:17:28,620
Please do not do this! You cannot do this, Your Majesty!

220
00:17:29,020 --> 00:17:32,920
Spare the Crown Princess' life! Let me go!

221
00:17:33,290 --> 00:17:34,360
Are you satisfied now?

222
00:17:34,890 --> 00:17:35,890
Your grace is...

223
00:17:36,630 --> 00:17:38,900
immeasurable, Your Majesty.

224
00:17:40,130 --> 00:17:43,000
- Your grace is immeasurable, - Your grace is immeasurable,

225
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,240
- Your Majesty! - Your Majesty!

226
00:17:47,370 --> 00:17:48,640
What are you talking about?

227
00:17:51,270 --> 00:17:52,980
The Royal Concubine is the Crown Princess?

228
00:17:53,510 --> 00:17:55,680
I know. I did not believe it either.

229
00:17:55,750 --> 00:17:58,680
But tons of people saw it. At that crowded execution ground,

230
00:17:58,820 --> 00:18:00,280
the Royal Concubine herself...

231
00:18:00,280 --> 00:18:02,120
claimed to be the Deposed Crown Princess Gang.

232
00:18:05,220 --> 00:18:06,460
Prepare my official robes.

233
00:18:07,060 --> 00:18:08,060
Yes, sir.

234
00:18:13,900 --> 00:18:15,430
If the Royal Concubine is really the Deposed Crown Princess,

235
00:18:16,100 --> 00:18:17,870
what is going to happen to her now?

236
00:18:18,100 --> 00:18:21,070
I heard His Majesty ordered her executed by strangulation.

237
00:18:22,140 --> 00:18:23,210
The Royal Concubine...

238
00:18:24,610 --> 00:18:26,340
No, if the Deposed Crown Princess dies again,

239
00:18:26,740 --> 00:18:28,280
the Crown Prince will be completely broken.

240
00:18:28,650 --> 00:18:30,780
Are you worried about His Highness?

241
00:18:30,780 --> 00:18:32,080
I am worried about myself.

242
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:36,250
If the Crown Prince falls, then no one can stop my father,

243
00:18:36,820 --> 00:18:38,520
and no one will find Deok Chun for me.

244
00:18:48,870 --> 00:18:50,500
Tell them to bring my ceremonial wedding attire.

245
00:18:54,470 --> 00:18:55,570
Your Highness.

246
00:18:57,570 --> 00:18:59,980
The Crown Princess's family returned to Unjeong Palace.

247
00:19:00,210 --> 00:19:01,850
They are all safe.

248
00:19:02,210 --> 00:19:03,510
Good. That is a relief.

249
00:19:04,180 --> 00:19:07,050
But what about the Crown Princess? What do we do now?

250
00:19:10,650 --> 00:19:14,620
Give the order, Your Highness, and I will break her out of prison.

251
00:19:14,690 --> 00:19:15,730
No!

252
00:19:16,330 --> 00:19:18,160
One reckless move, and we will lose Dal all over again.

253
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:26,770
You must not get worked up.

254
00:19:28,840 --> 00:19:30,770
You must not do anything reckless, Your Highness.

255
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:41,180
Please take care of my family for me.

256
00:19:49,990 --> 00:19:51,700
This is just like what happened five years ago.

257
00:19:54,970 --> 00:19:57,000
We must be extremely cautious.

258
00:19:58,340 --> 00:19:59,400
Your Highness.

259
00:19:59,740 --> 00:20:01,440
Grand Prince Je Un is here to see you.

260
00:20:04,870 --> 00:20:06,640
Did you come because you heard the news about Dal?

261
00:20:07,180 --> 00:20:09,950
Yes, but there is something strange going on.

262
00:20:10,650 --> 00:20:11,650
Strange? How so?

263
00:20:11,720 --> 00:20:16,050
I was at the Royal Office of Attire. U Hui asked for the wedding attire.

264
00:20:21,290 --> 00:20:23,590
- Is it ready? - Yes, Your Highness.

265
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:25,600
Yeo Ri will help me. The rest of you may leave.

266
00:20:31,940 --> 00:20:34,900
My lady. Please step outside for a moment.

267
00:20:36,370 --> 00:20:38,040
We will call you if we need any help.

268
00:20:38,410 --> 00:20:40,880
- But... - Please just go.

269
00:21:02,530 --> 00:21:04,130
It was always going to end this way.

270
00:21:04,530 --> 00:21:06,800
You took quite the detour to get here.

271
00:21:07,270 --> 00:21:09,170
What are you going to do with me now?

272
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:12,440
You will be sentenced to death by strangulation shortly.

273
00:21:12,810 --> 00:21:14,110
If you kill me,

274
00:21:14,680 --> 00:21:16,880
do you think the Crown Prince will simply do nothing?

275
00:21:17,350 --> 00:21:18,580
His Highness?

276
00:21:19,580 --> 00:21:21,850
What could he possibly do?

277
00:21:24,790 --> 00:21:26,690
At my mother's grave that day,

278
00:21:27,590 --> 00:21:29,360
I must have seen something I should not have.

279
00:21:30,160 --> 00:21:32,600
What in the world is on Mount Gamak?

280
00:21:33,900 --> 00:21:34,960
Mount Gamak.

281
00:21:40,140 --> 00:21:43,810
I know exactly what you are hiding on Mount Gamak.

282
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:45,980
If I die here today,

283
00:21:46,380 --> 00:21:48,410
the Crown Prince will reveal your secret.

284
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:50,810
After all, His Majesty and His Highness...

285
00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:53,520
were already considering giving up the throne.

286
00:21:53,980 --> 00:21:56,250
With nothing left to lose, they will not hesitate to expose you.

287
00:21:58,520 --> 00:22:00,290
Who do you think stands to lose more?

288
00:22:06,360 --> 00:22:07,560
Your Highness.

289
00:22:08,430 --> 00:22:11,500
You seem intent on digging your own grave over this.

290
00:22:28,920 --> 00:22:30,450
So there really is something there.

291
00:22:36,560 --> 00:22:38,600
I have to get this information to His Royal Highness.

292
00:22:43,030 --> 00:22:45,940
Do you not think you are reading too much into a simple fitting?

293
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:47,870
This is a woman who shot me in the heart...

294
00:22:47,870 --> 00:22:49,010
to avoid the Royal Wedding,

295
00:22:49,110 --> 00:22:52,340
Now she is volunteering to be fit. You do not find that odd?

296
00:23:05,190 --> 00:23:06,620
There really is a note.

297
00:23:07,490 --> 00:23:08,660
Impressive deduction.

298
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:26,680
What does it say?

299
00:23:36,220 --> 00:23:39,160
I will escape the Detached Palace. Please send help.

300
00:23:40,090 --> 00:23:42,190
I will create a diversion to distract my father.

301
00:23:42,660 --> 00:23:44,760
So use that chance to help the Royal Concubine escape.

302
00:23:45,830 --> 00:23:49,030
When you are ready, signal with a cuckoo call.

303
00:23:55,510 --> 00:23:56,810
I will do it.

304
00:23:56,810 --> 00:23:58,470
The Crown Princess Consort could be in danger.

305
00:23:58,540 --> 00:23:59,910
She is my woman.

306
00:24:01,850 --> 00:24:03,250
I will not let her get hurt.

307
00:24:05,980 --> 00:24:07,150
All right.

308
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:12,320
- Your Royal Highness. - Your Royal Highness.

309
00:24:27,300 --> 00:24:30,410
Is this the silk from the Hanyang Merchant Guild?

310
00:24:30,910 --> 00:24:32,010
Yes, Your Royal Highness.

311
00:24:32,910 --> 00:24:35,110
May I ask why you ask, Your Highness?

312
00:24:35,480 --> 00:24:37,910
Do you believe this crude pattern is fit for the Royal Family?

313
00:24:38,980 --> 00:24:40,820
Tell the Hanyang Merchant Guild to take this back immediately...

314
00:24:40,820 --> 00:24:42,090
and send a replacement.

315
00:24:42,820 --> 00:24:43,950
Yes, Your Highness.

316
00:25:37,340 --> 00:25:38,810
Your Highness.

317
00:25:39,480 --> 00:25:41,840
- Your Highness. - Your Highness.

318
00:25:44,310 --> 00:25:45,780
Your Highness.

319
00:25:47,050 --> 00:25:48,050
What happened?

320
00:25:48,120 --> 00:25:49,590
She has had no food or drink for days.

321
00:25:49,590 --> 00:25:51,050
It seems she has finally collapsed.

322
00:25:51,220 --> 00:25:52,560
Send for the Royal Physician now!

323
00:25:53,490 --> 00:25:55,890
Stay back. I will stab anyone who comes near me.

324
00:25:59,300 --> 00:26:01,130
- Yeo Ri. - Yes.

325
00:26:05,470 --> 00:26:07,100
You. Take off your clothes.

326
00:26:48,210 --> 00:26:49,550
Pardon the intrusion, my lord.

327
00:26:53,550 --> 00:26:54,820
The Crown Princess Consort...

328
00:26:55,790 --> 00:26:56,850
has escaped...

329
00:26:58,450 --> 00:26:59,760
from the Detached Palace.

330
00:27:02,430 --> 00:27:03,760
Was this Prince Je Un's doing?

331
00:27:03,960 --> 00:27:07,600
I already sent someone to check. Our spy at Eunwol Pavilion says...

332
00:27:07,800 --> 00:27:09,930
he has been there all day.

333
00:27:11,270 --> 00:27:12,840
What about the Deposed Crown Princess in the prison?

334
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:15,770
- I will go and check. - No.

335
00:27:17,010 --> 00:27:18,610
I will check on her myself.

336
00:27:26,620 --> 00:27:28,320
Left State Councillor. What brings you here?

337
00:27:28,620 --> 00:27:30,520
You just sent over a senior court lady from the Detached Palace.

338
00:27:43,730 --> 00:27:44,930
Open the door.

339
00:27:45,300 --> 00:27:46,440
Yes, my lord.

340
00:27:47,340 --> 00:27:48,370
Stop right there!

341
00:27:51,410 --> 00:27:52,480
Halt!

342
00:27:53,010 --> 00:27:55,210
- Seize him! - Surround him!

343
00:27:55,310 --> 00:27:56,350
Get him!

344
00:27:57,410 --> 00:27:58,820
Rescue Her Highness!

345
00:28:17,670 --> 00:28:19,970
- Get that man! - Seize him!

346
00:28:21,540 --> 00:28:23,110
Her Highness is the priority!

347
00:28:24,040 --> 00:28:26,080
Your Highness, are you all right?

348
00:28:26,310 --> 00:28:27,380
Your Highness!

349
00:28:28,110 --> 00:28:30,510
- Your Highness, please dismount. - Your Highness!

350
00:28:31,480 --> 00:28:32,480
Your Highness.

351
00:28:57,510 --> 00:28:58,880
How dare you...

352
00:29:03,280 --> 00:29:05,450
I will take the Royal Concubine's place in prison.

353
00:29:05,650 --> 00:29:07,420
You take her and get away from here.

354
00:29:07,450 --> 00:29:09,020
(Get away from here.)

355
00:29:11,320 --> 00:29:13,660
I am Senior Court Lady Jin Mi Ryeong of the Detached Palace.

356
00:29:14,390 --> 00:29:16,930
The Left State Councillor sent me to see the Deposed Crown Princess.

357
00:29:18,430 --> 00:29:20,030
Of all the times, right during the shift change?

358
00:29:20,800 --> 00:29:21,900
Go on in.

359
00:29:34,180 --> 00:29:37,150
What? Crown Princess Consort? What are you doing here?

360
00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:41,620
You need to get out of here and find Deok Chun.

361
00:29:41,950 --> 00:29:43,190
Give her this letter.

362
00:29:45,760 --> 00:29:46,890
To Choraengi Mask?

363
00:29:49,430 --> 00:29:50,430
It is unlocked.

364
00:29:54,230 --> 00:29:55,330
We are out of time.

365
00:29:55,670 --> 00:29:58,300
Hold on. What is the plan?

366
00:29:59,170 --> 00:30:00,270
A little switcheroo.

367
00:30:03,240 --> 00:30:05,140
The Deposed Crown Princess has escaped! Find her!

368
00:30:05,140 --> 00:30:06,240
- Yes, sir! - Yes, sir!

369
00:30:18,090 --> 00:30:19,090
All right.

370
00:30:20,820 --> 00:30:21,890
Let us move out.

371
00:30:22,660 --> 00:30:23,660
- Yes, sir. - Yes, sir.

372
00:30:29,870 --> 00:30:30,900
Halt!

373
00:30:32,370 --> 00:30:33,470
Keep moving.

374
00:30:36,110 --> 00:30:39,880
- What is all this? - Yes, sir. This is...

375
00:30:40,340 --> 00:30:44,310
silk for the Royal Office of Attire. But we were ordered to redeliver it.

376
00:30:44,410 --> 00:30:46,880
I have no record of that order, so I will have to inspect it.

377
00:30:46,950 --> 00:30:49,550
But this is the Royal Office of Attire seal.

378
00:30:49,590 --> 00:30:50,720
Step aside.

379
00:30:56,830 --> 00:30:57,990
This is bad.

380
00:31:15,510 --> 00:31:17,680
Be careful!

381
00:31:18,310 --> 00:31:22,050
Each roll is 100 nyang. If you tear even a single thread,

382
00:31:22,150 --> 00:31:25,250
you will be buying this entire box.

383
00:31:25,250 --> 00:31:26,990
One, two, three, four, five.

384
00:31:27,060 --> 00:31:29,730
Gosh, that is enough to buy a fine house.

385
00:31:29,930 --> 00:31:33,900
How many years' pay for a guard? Twenty?

386
00:31:34,330 --> 00:31:36,700
Two hundred years? Good grief.

387
00:31:36,930 --> 00:31:38,970
So be very careful with your inspection.

388
00:31:44,240 --> 00:31:46,510
- Get out of here. - Right away, sir.

389
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:48,380
Thank you, sir.

390
00:31:57,450 --> 00:31:58,450
Hurry.

391
00:31:59,790 --> 00:32:00,990
Let us go. Hurry.

392
00:32:04,760 --> 00:32:06,600
Tell the Hanyang Merchant Guild to take this back immediately...

393
00:32:06,600 --> 00:32:07,930
and send a replacement.

394
00:32:08,730 --> 00:32:09,730
Yes, Your Highness.

395
00:32:14,440 --> 00:32:16,440
How can you be thinking about silk at a time like this?

396
00:32:16,940 --> 00:32:20,680
Always be aware of your surroundings no matter the circumstances.

397
00:32:32,890 --> 00:32:36,390
The Crown Prince and Crown Princess have safely escaped the palace.

398
00:32:38,590 --> 00:32:39,660
Thank goodness.

399
00:32:42,800 --> 00:32:43,800
In the end,

400
00:32:44,930 --> 00:32:46,900
nothing has changed from five years ago.

401
00:32:47,940 --> 00:32:51,340
Then and now, you are what is most important to me.

402
00:32:53,880 --> 00:32:55,010
I have found evidence...

403
00:32:56,310 --> 00:32:59,620
that the Left State Councillor has a private army called The Nameless.

404
00:33:00,620 --> 00:33:03,120
- A private army? - This is treason.

405
00:33:03,890 --> 00:33:04,920
However,

406
00:33:05,790 --> 00:33:07,620
I do not have any definitive proof yet.

407
00:33:08,590 --> 00:33:10,230
According to this letter from Dal,

408
00:33:10,490 --> 00:33:11,660
the Choraengi Mask is in Yangju,

409
00:33:11,660 --> 00:33:13,500
and The Nameless are in a mountain fortress.

410
00:33:14,200 --> 00:33:15,660
Let us search the nearby mountains.

411
00:33:16,030 --> 00:33:18,930
All I know is that their base of operations is in Yangju.

412
00:33:19,370 --> 00:33:21,200
Speaking of which,

413
00:33:22,140 --> 00:33:23,470
if I were to die,

414
00:33:23,940 --> 00:33:26,210
someone else will release the secret pact.

415
00:33:27,610 --> 00:33:29,280
The secret pact must be there.

416
00:33:30,080 --> 00:33:31,380
The Left State Councillor said...

417
00:33:31,580 --> 00:33:33,880
the secret pact would be released if he died.

418
00:33:33,880 --> 00:33:34,980
He must have...

419
00:33:35,320 --> 00:33:38,250
hidden it with the one he trusts most, the leader of The Nameless.

420
00:33:39,120 --> 00:33:40,420
Do you have a plan?

421
00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:43,660
I plan to go to Yangju with Je Un to find the base of The Nameless.

422
00:33:45,530 --> 00:33:47,460
You will be risking your life.

423
00:33:48,760 --> 00:33:50,100
Are you prepared for that?

424
00:33:50,200 --> 00:33:53,100
No. I have no intention of just rolling over and dying.

425
00:33:53,670 --> 00:33:56,840
I am not the same Yeon Wol who quietly vanished five years ago.

426
00:33:57,240 --> 00:33:58,340
I am not leaving...

427
00:33:59,940 --> 00:34:01,240
His Highness' side, ever.

428
00:34:02,080 --> 00:34:05,110
I will survive and live the rest of my days in happiness.

429
00:34:05,820 --> 00:34:07,180
As if to spite them for the past,

430
00:34:07,680 --> 00:34:08,950
I will live a life they can only envy.

431
00:34:09,750 --> 00:34:11,220
Things are different from five years ago.

432
00:34:19,460 --> 00:34:20,530
You are right.

433
00:34:21,900 --> 00:34:23,930
Both the Crown Princess and you, the Crown Prince, have changed,

434
00:34:25,530 --> 00:34:27,740
so there is no reason why I should stay the same.

435
00:34:28,400 --> 00:34:29,870
As they demand, I will sentence the Crown Princess...

436
00:34:29,870 --> 00:34:31,070
to death by strangulation.

437
00:34:31,810 --> 00:34:33,440
When the Left State Councillor lets his guard down,

438
00:34:33,880 --> 00:34:35,880
take the Crown Princess and escape the palace.

439
00:34:37,850 --> 00:34:38,850
Royal Father.

440
00:34:39,110 --> 00:34:40,220
Bring me the Royal Tally.

441
00:34:40,420 --> 00:34:41,580
Yes, Your Majesty.

442
00:35:03,640 --> 00:35:04,740
Take this.

443
00:35:04,870 --> 00:35:05,880
(Royal Tally: This wooden tablet mobilizes troops...)

444
00:35:05,940 --> 00:35:08,380
(when its two halves are joined.)

445
00:35:10,280 --> 00:35:11,350
I am so sorry.

446
00:35:14,150 --> 00:35:16,950
For being a cowardly father who was not always there for you.

447
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:22,160
I will be right back,

448
00:35:23,260 --> 00:35:24,290
Father.

449
00:35:35,300 --> 00:35:38,340
My lord, you must hurry. Goodness.

450
00:36:12,410 --> 00:36:13,940
So,

451
00:36:14,840 --> 00:36:17,110
is that snoring supposed to be convincing?

452
00:36:21,080 --> 00:36:24,220
My lord, what took you so long? I was just...

453
00:36:25,990 --> 00:36:27,820
No, wait. Why are you even here?

454
00:36:28,820 --> 00:36:30,430
You should have grabbed the Crown Princess Consort's hand...

455
00:36:30,430 --> 00:36:31,460
and just run for it.

456
00:36:34,360 --> 00:36:35,460
To survive.

457
00:36:37,300 --> 00:36:38,430
So I can live...

458
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:41,570
and wait.

459
00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:48,340
U Hui.

460
00:37:03,930 --> 00:37:06,130
They will find out I have escaped any second now.

461
00:37:07,030 --> 00:37:08,130
You have to hurry.

462
00:37:08,900 --> 00:37:09,900
Okay.

463
00:37:17,810 --> 00:37:19,710
Buy me as much time as you can.

464
00:37:21,840 --> 00:37:23,210
I have to go now.

465
00:37:30,350 --> 00:37:31,390
U Hui.

466
00:37:36,430 --> 00:37:37,730
Will you not be in danger?

467
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:43,230
If the bait is trying to save its own skin,

468
00:37:45,630 --> 00:37:47,300
the fish will never bite.

469
00:38:10,660 --> 00:38:11,690
I do not know.

470
00:38:12,460 --> 00:38:14,160
I do not know about any of that.

471
00:38:15,630 --> 00:38:16,630
How...

472
00:38:17,970 --> 00:38:19,400
can I possibly leave you behind?

473
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:23,940
Can we not just run away together, right now?

474
00:39:14,220 --> 00:39:15,220
You must live.

475
00:39:16,360 --> 00:39:20,000
If you get caught this time, my father will kill you.

476
00:39:21,360 --> 00:39:22,360
So...

477
00:39:25,870 --> 00:39:27,040
live for me, Un.

478
00:39:33,110 --> 00:39:34,440
I will come back to you.

479
00:40:12,650 --> 00:40:13,650
Let us go.

480
00:40:13,980 --> 00:40:14,980
Yes, Your Highness.

481
00:40:23,360 --> 00:40:24,790
Where is the Deposed Crown Princess?

482
00:40:25,790 --> 00:40:26,830
I do not know.

483
00:40:27,730 --> 00:40:29,900
Even if I did,

484
00:40:31,330 --> 00:40:32,900
would I have taken all this trouble to tell you?

485
00:40:59,630 --> 00:41:00,660
Yeo Ri.

486
00:41:04,400 --> 00:41:05,400
Yeo...

487
00:41:06,500 --> 00:41:07,540
Yeo Ri!

488
00:41:15,380 --> 00:41:16,380
Yeo Ri.

489
00:41:19,680 --> 00:41:20,680
Yeo Ri.

490
00:41:32,790 --> 00:41:34,460
Even if I were to kill 100 more like her,

491
00:41:35,100 --> 00:41:36,970
you would not even bat an eye.

492
00:42:04,160 --> 00:42:06,230
Find the Deposed Crown Princess, no matter what it takes.

493
00:42:06,600 --> 00:42:07,600
Yes, my lord.

494
00:42:08,330 --> 00:42:10,070
(Bounty: 100 nyang)

495
00:42:10,130 --> 00:42:11,800
- Get her! - Yes, sir!

496
00:42:14,900 --> 00:42:17,810
(Bounty: 100 nyang)

497
00:42:33,890 --> 00:42:35,690
Looks like the horse is tired too.

498
00:42:36,590 --> 00:42:38,990
We cannot blame him. We have been riding nonstop.

499
00:42:40,300 --> 00:42:42,300
Should we find an inn in a nearby town?

500
00:42:43,600 --> 00:42:44,630
Let us do that.

501
00:42:49,040 --> 00:42:50,140
Hey, you! Get over here!

502
00:42:52,210 --> 00:42:53,810
You know this woman or not?

503
00:42:55,440 --> 00:42:58,010
- What are you doing? - How dare you?

504
00:42:59,680 --> 00:43:01,180
(Bounty: 100 nyang)

505
00:43:01,250 --> 00:43:03,550
Look closely. Do you know her or not?

506
00:43:04,190 --> 00:43:05,250
I said, take a good look.

507
00:43:05,850 --> 00:43:07,420
I said look, you jerk!

508
00:43:08,060 --> 00:43:09,060
Take a good look!

509
00:43:10,590 --> 00:43:11,590
Let us go.

510
00:43:12,690 --> 00:43:13,700
Okay.

511
00:43:18,500 --> 00:43:22,140
- The sun will be setting soon. - What? Let me see.

512
00:43:22,800 --> 00:43:24,640
Okay, this is Mount Bulgok.

513
00:43:26,880 --> 00:43:31,480
Right, follow me. I have an amazing swallow stashed away nearby.

514
00:43:31,880 --> 00:43:35,950
What? Wait, just how many swallows do you have?

515
00:43:36,690 --> 00:43:37,720
Hurry on now.

516
00:43:39,190 --> 00:43:40,820
This is the place.

517
00:43:43,490 --> 00:43:44,490
I see.

518
00:43:45,260 --> 00:43:46,460
It looks like no one is home.

519
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:49,870
- Here, come on in. - Hey, wait a minute.

520
00:43:52,170 --> 00:43:53,170
Are you sure this is the right house?

521
00:43:54,240 --> 00:43:55,540
See this stone clock?

522
00:43:55,900 --> 00:43:58,940
It means they have gone far off to gather medicinal herbs.

523
00:43:59,270 --> 00:44:00,280
Come on in.

524
00:44:03,380 --> 00:44:04,550
That is what that means?

525
00:44:07,280 --> 00:44:10,120
A grateful man I saved once told me...

526
00:44:10,120 --> 00:44:12,250
to stop by if I was in the area.

527
00:44:12,620 --> 00:44:15,060
He said if no one was home, I could make myself comfortable.

528
00:44:16,220 --> 00:44:17,230
Okay?

529
00:44:17,830 --> 00:44:21,930
I told you, Your Royal Highness. Just trust me and follow.

530
00:44:22,230 --> 00:44:23,230
This way.

531
00:44:25,470 --> 00:44:26,600
What do you mean by that?

532
00:44:27,140 --> 00:44:28,600
What do you mean, we have to go to Mount Gamak?

533
00:44:28,900 --> 00:44:31,570
Actually, on the day I was arrested,

534
00:44:32,110 --> 00:44:33,780
I exchanged a few words with the Left State Councillor.

535
00:44:34,540 --> 00:44:36,680
Something felt off, so I prodded him a bit.

536
00:44:36,950 --> 00:44:39,850
The way he got flustered was unusual and has been bothering me.

537
00:44:42,880 --> 00:44:46,820
(6 years ago, Mount Gamak, Yeon Wol's Mother's Grave)

538
00:44:50,060 --> 00:44:51,060
We should go.

539
00:44:53,330 --> 00:44:54,730
Please take me to the palace.

540
00:44:56,630 --> 00:44:58,870
- Who are you? - This letter...

541
00:45:02,840 --> 00:45:05,170
My apologies. This is my lady.

542
00:45:05,340 --> 00:45:07,380
She lost her son and has not been in her right mind since.

543
00:45:08,140 --> 00:45:11,010
My lady, you should at least put on your shoes.

544
00:45:11,280 --> 00:45:12,310
The ground is frozen.

545
00:45:23,730 --> 00:45:24,930
Please excuse our intrusion.

546
00:45:25,290 --> 00:45:27,300
- Let us go. - Let me go!

547
00:45:27,360 --> 00:45:30,900
Your Highness. Based on her clothes, she seems to be from a noble family.

548
00:45:32,430 --> 00:45:33,640
There are no signs of abuse either.

549
00:45:35,400 --> 00:45:36,640
I did not realise it at the time,

550
00:45:37,340 --> 00:45:40,310
but her socks were not worn out, and her clothes were clean.

551
00:45:40,910 --> 00:45:43,010
She did not look like someone who had crossed mountains and rivers.

552
00:45:44,580 --> 00:45:47,020
Are you saying The Nameless have a base on Mount Gamak?

553
00:45:47,680 --> 00:45:49,420
Yes, most likely.

554
00:45:50,020 --> 00:45:52,490
And above all, my brother.

555
00:45:53,360 --> 00:45:56,060
Have you learned of the woman in white on Mount Gamak?

556
00:45:59,560 --> 00:46:00,900
I am still looking into it.

557
00:46:01,500 --> 00:46:04,500
I will report back once I have investigated more thoroughly.

558
00:46:04,930 --> 00:46:08,240
Then you did not come to tell me about that woman?

559
00:46:09,600 --> 00:46:11,610
If something should happen to me,

560
00:46:13,240 --> 00:46:15,240
please give this book to His Royal Highness.

561
00:46:17,150 --> 00:46:19,850
What do you mean by that? If something should happen?

562
00:46:20,420 --> 00:46:24,090
Soon after that, I was deposed, and my family was wiped out.

563
00:46:24,920 --> 00:46:26,290
The woman in white on Mount Gamak.

564
00:46:27,660 --> 00:46:29,390
The Nameless, who are protecting her.

565
00:46:30,530 --> 00:46:32,490
And the book my brother left behind while tracking her.

566
00:46:33,700 --> 00:46:35,760
I am sure there is a clue in it.

567
00:46:36,100 --> 00:46:37,130
Wait a minute.

568
00:46:38,170 --> 00:46:39,170
A book, you say?

569
00:46:40,100 --> 00:46:41,240
By any chance,

570
00:46:42,470 --> 00:46:43,470
was that book a military treatise?

571
00:46:44,810 --> 00:46:45,810
How did you know?

572
00:46:46,410 --> 00:46:48,240
Five years ago, I had your things gathered and stored...

573
00:46:48,240 --> 00:46:49,910
in the Royal Office of Attire.

574
00:46:50,580 --> 00:46:52,080
Oddly, there was a military treatise among them,

575
00:46:52,610 --> 00:46:54,020
and I remember thinking it was strange.

576
00:47:00,020 --> 00:47:02,020
There has to be a major clue inside.

577
00:47:04,390 --> 00:47:05,630
But we cannot get into the palace,

578
00:47:07,200 --> 00:47:09,060
and the whole place is crawling with their shadowy thugs.

579
00:47:10,630 --> 00:47:12,130
Whether it is Mount Gamak or the palace,

580
00:47:12,600 --> 00:47:14,300
it is too dangerous to make a move right now.

581
00:47:14,870 --> 00:47:16,740
Let us lie low for a few days first.

582
00:47:18,670 --> 00:47:19,670
Okay.

583
00:47:33,720 --> 00:47:35,360
Oh, gosh.

584
00:47:35,390 --> 00:47:36,560
Where are you off to?

585
00:47:37,090 --> 00:47:38,130
You are awake?

586
00:47:38,830 --> 00:47:40,460
I was just about to make some breakfast.

587
00:47:41,430 --> 00:47:42,430
No, do not!

588
00:47:44,930 --> 00:47:46,000
What do you mean?

589
00:47:46,770 --> 00:47:48,800
I will do it.

590
00:47:50,740 --> 00:47:53,410
Do not worry about it. I will do it.

591
00:47:58,450 --> 00:48:00,450
You just do not want to eat my cooking?

592
00:48:00,650 --> 00:48:03,150
No, that is not it.

593
00:48:03,850 --> 00:48:05,820
I think I can handle it.

594
00:48:06,620 --> 00:48:07,720
I think I can handle it.

595
00:48:08,320 --> 00:48:10,360
No.

596
00:48:10,360 --> 00:48:12,230
I can do this.

597
00:48:12,430 --> 00:48:13,430
No!

598
00:48:14,900 --> 00:48:17,030
Darn. Gosh!

599
00:48:17,400 --> 00:48:19,300
You, the Crown Prince, and me...

600
00:48:19,670 --> 00:48:21,340
We are both useless when it comes to cooking.

601
00:48:21,840 --> 00:48:22,840
Let me see.

602
00:48:32,210 --> 00:48:33,720
What are you doing with that knife?

603
00:48:36,050 --> 00:48:37,520
Move aside. Let me do it.

604
00:48:37,790 --> 00:48:38,850
Oh, gosh!

605
00:49:09,820 --> 00:49:10,890
How come he is good?

606
00:49:12,250 --> 00:49:13,490
I have learned that knife work...

607
00:49:14,860 --> 00:49:16,460
is all pretty much the same.

608
00:49:17,160 --> 00:49:18,430
It is only how you slice that is different.

609
00:49:20,060 --> 00:49:21,460
And what have you sliced before?

610
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:26,130
I am telling you, it is not as easy as it looks.

611
00:49:26,630 --> 00:49:28,540
A beginner cannot just do it.

612
00:49:29,500 --> 00:49:33,410
Watch closely. This is not about brute force.

613
00:49:34,110 --> 00:49:35,140
It is all about the technique.

614
00:49:46,120 --> 00:49:47,390
I knew this would happen.

615
00:49:48,190 --> 00:49:49,890
- Gosh, hold on. - Your skills...

616
00:49:49,890 --> 00:49:52,030
will not give you rice from your lady.

617
00:49:52,730 --> 00:49:53,730
Give it here.

618
00:49:54,300 --> 00:49:55,300
Goodness.

619
00:49:55,630 --> 00:49:56,930
If you were that lady,

620
00:49:57,730 --> 00:49:59,300
I would not eat that rice anyway.

621
00:50:01,700 --> 00:50:04,240
I am good at chopping more than just firewood.

622
00:50:15,750 --> 00:50:17,890
- Is it good? - Yes.

623
00:50:24,230 --> 00:50:26,360
- Is it good? - It is delicious.

624
00:50:30,270 --> 00:50:31,930
These walnuts...

625
00:50:32,670 --> 00:50:35,270
These would be great with persimmons, do you not think?

626
00:50:36,470 --> 00:50:39,810
A true prince, focused on persimmons at a time like this.

627
00:50:40,480 --> 00:50:42,910
Who said it was for me? I wanted...

628
00:50:42,980 --> 00:50:45,250
to give you something delicious to eat, that is all.

629
00:50:46,010 --> 00:50:47,450
Come on.

630
00:50:50,450 --> 00:50:53,220
Any other time, maybe. But not now. I do not want any persimmons.

631
00:50:54,090 --> 00:50:55,090
Why?

632
00:50:55,420 --> 00:50:57,560
Because if we go outside to find persimmons,

633
00:50:57,560 --> 00:50:58,790
we might die right away.

634
00:51:13,780 --> 00:51:14,780
I mean,

635
00:51:15,540 --> 00:51:17,980
it is so sweltering, even at night.

636
00:51:18,610 --> 00:51:21,480
So I made a chilling joke to cool us down.

637
00:51:21,850 --> 00:51:23,350
No need to look so serious.

638
00:51:30,360 --> 00:51:31,360
What if we...

639
00:51:34,360 --> 00:51:35,830
just ran away from all this?

640
00:51:38,470 --> 00:51:40,440
What are you talking about?

641
00:51:41,470 --> 00:51:42,940
The military treatise my brother left behind...

642
00:51:43,240 --> 00:51:45,640
might have clues about The Nameless.

643
00:51:51,650 --> 00:51:52,850
And what if it is another dead end?

644
00:51:55,650 --> 00:51:57,290
What if that is not enough to beat the Left State Councillor?

645
00:52:00,190 --> 00:52:01,190
And what if, in the end,

646
00:52:05,560 --> 00:52:06,760
I cannot protect you?

647
00:52:12,030 --> 00:52:13,430
You are here, alive and well.

648
00:52:17,070 --> 00:52:18,140
And we are right here,

649
00:52:20,170 --> 00:52:21,740
smiling at each other.

650
00:52:23,550 --> 00:52:24,910
All this talk of revenge and justice...

651
00:52:27,520 --> 00:52:28,780
What does any of it matter?

652
00:52:33,660 --> 00:52:35,390
I just want to be your Lee Gang.

653
00:52:38,130 --> 00:52:39,130
Can we not just...

654
00:52:41,360 --> 00:52:42,560
live like that?

655
00:53:18,700 --> 00:53:20,100
If the Crown Prince is gone,

656
00:53:20,840 --> 00:53:22,770
the next in line is Grand Prince Je Un.

657
00:53:24,370 --> 00:53:26,770
We must stop Grand Prince Je Un...

658
00:53:27,810 --> 00:53:29,680
from taking the throne at all costs.

659
00:53:29,940 --> 00:53:32,650
But he is your only blood relative, Your Majesty.

660
00:53:33,110 --> 00:53:36,280
Better for him to take the throne than a stranger...

661
00:53:36,350 --> 00:53:37,350
I...

662
00:53:37,650 --> 00:53:40,460
framed Grand Prince Je Un's mother for adultery and had her killed.

663
00:53:40,760 --> 00:53:42,790
And I banished him to Sinjusa.

664
00:53:43,520 --> 00:53:48,460
Who knows what vengeance he harbours in his dark heart?

665
00:53:49,460 --> 00:53:50,470
He must never,

666
00:53:51,030 --> 00:53:53,640
ever sit on the throne.

667
00:53:55,900 --> 00:53:56,900
Your Majesty.

668
00:53:57,270 --> 00:54:00,810
There is a rumour spreading secretly among the court ladies.

669
00:54:19,530 --> 00:54:21,200
Where is the Left State Councillor?

670
00:54:23,600 --> 00:54:26,570
I am aware that the Crown Princess Consort...

671
00:54:27,470 --> 00:54:29,740
eloped with Grand Prince Je Un...

672
00:54:30,640 --> 00:54:31,970
not too long ago.

673
00:54:33,170 --> 00:54:35,080
Did you summon me just to threaten me?

674
00:54:37,850 --> 00:54:39,810
I summoned you to make a deal.

675
00:54:42,480 --> 00:54:44,820
Even if you cannot find the Crown Prince,

676
00:54:46,590 --> 00:54:48,820
you must stop Grand Prince Je Un...

677
00:54:50,530 --> 00:54:51,530
from taking the throne.

678
00:54:52,160 --> 00:54:53,230
But Grand Prince Je Un...

679
00:54:54,130 --> 00:54:56,560
is your only blood relative, is he not?

680
00:54:56,930 --> 00:54:58,700
I have never once...

681
00:54:59,670 --> 00:55:01,900
considered that boy my grandson.

682
00:55:03,240 --> 00:55:05,270
A prophecy foretold that if Queen Jangjeong had a son...

683
00:55:06,070 --> 00:55:08,010
and that son became the Crown Prince,

684
00:55:08,280 --> 00:55:09,280
the late King...

685
00:55:10,280 --> 00:55:13,310
would not live out his natural life.

686
00:55:14,180 --> 00:55:15,480
And that prophecy came true.

687
00:55:16,880 --> 00:55:19,420
Grand Prince Je Un should never have been born.

688
00:55:20,590 --> 00:55:22,690
No, from the very beginning,

689
00:55:23,830 --> 00:55:24,830
Queen Jangjeong,

690
00:55:25,830 --> 00:55:27,430
a woman so wretched,

691
00:55:28,130 --> 00:55:30,430
should never have been made Queen.

692
00:55:31,900 --> 00:55:33,430
The curse upon the Royal Family...

693
00:55:33,970 --> 00:55:35,770
and the tragedy of today.

694
00:55:36,340 --> 00:55:37,770
It is all because of that mother and son.

695
00:55:38,770 --> 00:55:42,680
So for the throne to now go to Grand Prince Je Un...

696
00:55:43,280 --> 00:55:44,580
is utterly unthinkable.

697
00:55:50,850 --> 00:55:51,950
Your Majesty,

698
00:55:54,060 --> 00:55:56,290
you have not changed one bit.

699
00:55:58,830 --> 00:56:01,530
I thought I had taken everything.

700
00:56:03,330 --> 00:56:05,300
What are you still protecting?

701
00:56:06,370 --> 00:56:09,370
Why are you still clinging to your avarice?

702
00:56:10,670 --> 00:56:11,910
Taken everything?

703
00:56:14,680 --> 00:56:15,780
What do you mean?

704
00:56:18,480 --> 00:56:21,950
Do you really believe what happened in the Gyesa Year...

705
00:56:22,450 --> 00:56:24,420
was because of some prophecy?

706
00:56:25,750 --> 00:56:27,760
You are still blaming...

707
00:56:27,760 --> 00:56:29,890
Queen Jangjeong and Grand Prince Je Un?

708
00:56:31,190 --> 00:56:32,660
What happened in the Gyesa Year...

709
00:56:35,100 --> 00:56:37,060
was because of you, Your Majesty.

710
00:56:43,240 --> 00:56:46,410
Why did you do that to Queen Jangjeong?

711
00:58:09,490 --> 00:58:10,630
Royal Mother!

712
00:58:11,730 --> 00:58:12,930
Royal Mother!

713
00:58:18,530 --> 00:58:19,630
Crown Prince,

714
00:58:20,530 --> 00:58:25,410
you must never resent your Royal Father.

715
00:58:26,270 --> 00:58:29,880
Your eyes, your nose, your lips...

716
00:58:30,980 --> 00:58:33,450
From the tips of your fingers to your toes,

717
00:58:34,820 --> 00:58:38,650
everything you are was a gift from your Royal Father.

718
00:58:46,290 --> 00:58:47,360
Royal Mother!

719
00:58:48,030 --> 00:58:49,130
Royal Mother!

720
00:58:50,200 --> 00:58:51,600
Royal Mother!

721
00:58:52,730 --> 00:58:54,370
Royal Mother!

722
00:58:59,140 --> 00:59:00,470
It cannot be...

723
00:59:08,080 --> 00:59:09,780
Why on earth...

724
00:59:10,650 --> 00:59:12,590
did you kill that precious woman...

725
00:59:15,290 --> 00:59:19,630
by framing her with such a filthy accusation of adultery?

726
00:59:31,070 --> 00:59:32,840
So it was my fault.

727
00:59:34,640 --> 00:59:35,640
So,

728
00:59:38,380 --> 00:59:40,450
do you not ever

729
00:59:42,920 --> 00:59:44,890
let the name of Queen Jangjeong...

730
00:59:46,390 --> 00:59:48,090
pass your lips again.

731
01:00:06,370 --> 01:00:07,810
We are going to Qing.

732
01:00:08,210 --> 01:00:09,940
My wife and I. Just the two of us.

733
01:00:11,710 --> 01:00:15,180
Have a boat ready for us at Jemulpo by tomorrow afternoon.

734
01:00:15,650 --> 01:00:17,250
Yes, of course, my lord.

735
01:00:19,620 --> 01:00:20,620
Wait...

736
01:00:22,660 --> 01:00:25,460
What? A hundred nyang?

737
01:01:02,930 --> 01:01:04,530
His Majesty sent me.

738
01:01:04,900 --> 01:01:07,800
He sent me to help Your Highness in fulfilling your great cause.

739
01:01:08,170 --> 01:01:10,970
Wait, how did you know to find me here?

740
01:01:11,370 --> 01:01:13,070
I have searched the entire area.

741
01:01:30,660 --> 01:01:32,430
Wait...

742
01:01:33,260 --> 01:01:34,560
They are here!

743
01:01:45,710 --> 01:01:47,110
Hand over the Deposed Crown Princess...

744
01:01:47,110 --> 01:01:48,480
and return to the palace, Your Highness.

745
01:01:49,010 --> 01:01:50,040
I refuse.

746
01:01:50,210 --> 01:01:52,980
We have orders to bring you back, by force if necessary.

747
01:01:53,110 --> 01:01:54,220
Is that right?

748
01:01:55,780 --> 01:01:58,920
- Take Dal and go. That is an order. - Your Highness.

749
01:01:58,920 --> 01:02:02,660
- How can I leave you behind? - Go now! From this moment,

750
01:02:03,690 --> 01:02:04,830
I am doing things my way.

751
01:02:11,530 --> 01:02:13,130
- Your Highness! - Your Highness!

752
01:02:15,340 --> 01:02:17,240
Fine. Come and get me.

753
01:02:17,970 --> 01:02:18,970
Whatever dream he has,

754
01:02:18,970 --> 01:02:20,770
come at me if you want to ruin the Left State Councillor's dream.

755
01:02:24,710 --> 01:02:25,710
Go!

756
01:02:30,020 --> 01:02:32,290
What are you waiting for? Clear a path.

757
01:02:40,330 --> 01:02:41,330
Clear the way!

758
01:02:56,010 --> 01:02:57,010
You should go now.

759
01:02:58,680 --> 01:02:59,680
Right.

760
01:03:11,530 --> 01:03:12,760
But Your Highness...

761
01:03:14,460 --> 01:03:18,130
Is it enough for just the two of us to be happy?

762
01:03:20,940 --> 01:03:24,210
What about the Crown Princess Consort and Prince Je Un?

763
01:03:25,510 --> 01:03:27,980
And even His Majesty, who is waiting anxiously for us?

764
01:03:29,980 --> 01:03:34,420
If we turn our backs on everyone who is counting on us,

765
01:03:36,980 --> 01:03:38,190
can we truly be happy?

766
01:03:40,320 --> 01:03:41,560
The Left State Councillor will continue...

767
01:03:41,560 --> 01:03:42,820
to get away with his evil deeds.

768
01:03:43,320 --> 01:03:46,230
And if we live on the run when we have done nothing wrong,

769
01:03:47,630 --> 01:03:49,030
would that not be a raw deal?

770
01:03:49,760 --> 01:03:52,030
As a peddler, I cannot stand taking a loss.

771
01:03:53,100 --> 01:03:55,900
We do not know if The Nameless's base is on Mount Gamak,

772
01:03:57,470 --> 01:04:00,810
or if the secret pact is even there. Nothing is certain.

773
01:04:05,910 --> 01:04:07,720
We have to try, even if it is a long shot.

774
01:04:09,450 --> 01:04:12,120
If there is even a small chance, we have to go look.

775
01:04:15,490 --> 01:04:18,490
Right now, this is our last stand. It is an all-or-nothing gamble.

776
01:04:19,890 --> 01:04:23,200
If there is anything we can do, we have to go all in.

777
01:04:24,400 --> 01:04:27,800
Even if we are flying blind, we have to charge straight ahead.

778
01:04:43,380 --> 01:04:44,450
You are right.

779
01:04:45,290 --> 01:04:46,450
We will do it your way.

780
01:04:50,790 --> 01:04:54,830
There is a temple called Jeungyeongsa on Mount Gamak.

781
01:04:54,900 --> 01:04:56,030
- I will wait for you there. - No, I will be the one to go.

782
01:04:57,870 --> 01:05:00,630
But you have to go to the palace and find that military treatise.

783
01:05:02,470 --> 01:05:04,610
I thought this body-swapping was a curse,

784
01:05:05,070 --> 01:05:08,640
but this could actually be a golden opportunity.

785
01:05:11,250 --> 01:05:13,010
I know how to fight, so I will go to the mountain fort.

786
01:05:13,080 --> 01:05:15,380
You are quick on your feet, so you find the treatise at the palace.

787
01:05:16,650 --> 01:05:18,620
You will be confined on arrival, so it will not be easy.

788
01:05:18,620 --> 01:05:20,590
But find it and send it with Je Un.

789
01:05:22,920 --> 01:05:25,730
Please just do as I say this time.

790
01:05:27,660 --> 01:05:28,660
Okay.

791
01:05:50,820 --> 01:05:52,620
Your Royal Highness!

792
01:05:53,390 --> 01:05:55,290
His Majesty ordered you to be confined.

793
01:05:55,460 --> 01:05:57,860
But it was not his decision, was it?

794
01:05:58,060 --> 01:06:00,560
An order to be confined? I will be trapped with no way out.

795
01:06:01,200 --> 01:06:04,130
Oh, right. I have to return "The Art of War"...

796
01:06:04,130 --> 01:06:05,170
I borrowed from Je Un.

797
01:06:05,930 --> 01:06:08,700
- It is in the wardrobe. - Seriously? Is that important now?

798
01:06:10,870 --> 01:06:11,940
Do you remember...

799
01:06:13,040 --> 01:06:17,980
the moon we saw at Jeungyeongsa on Mount Gamak?

800
01:06:19,050 --> 01:06:20,780
Why are you suddenly going on about temples and moons?

801
01:06:21,080 --> 01:06:22,320
There, the moon...

802
01:06:23,020 --> 01:06:25,320
still lingers.

803
01:06:26,690 --> 01:06:29,460
Return the book to Je Un. The military treatise.

804
01:07:16,100 --> 01:07:17,370
"The Art of War".

805
01:07:20,770 --> 01:07:21,780
Right.

806
01:07:23,040 --> 01:07:25,080
("The Art of War")

807
01:07:31,650 --> 01:07:35,320
The Crown Prince told you to deliver this book to me?

808
01:07:35,560 --> 01:07:36,620
Yes.

809
01:07:43,530 --> 01:07:46,270
He also mentioned the Royal Tally and the moon we saw...

810
01:07:46,270 --> 01:07:48,170
at Jeungyeongsa on Mount Gamak.

811
01:07:48,800 --> 01:07:53,370
But I do not recall ever going to Mount Gamak with His Highness.

812
01:07:57,510 --> 01:07:58,850
The moon?

813
01:08:00,050 --> 01:08:04,120
He said, "The moon still lingers there."

814
01:08:05,450 --> 01:08:09,290
Maybe he is saying the Crown Princess is at Jeungyeongsa?

815
01:08:21,700 --> 01:08:23,770
But this is just a military treatise.

816
01:08:24,400 --> 01:08:25,610
What is different about it?

817
01:08:40,050 --> 01:08:41,090
It is different.

818
01:08:46,760 --> 01:08:49,960
I found The Nameless's hideout in the military treatise.

819
01:08:50,100 --> 01:08:52,600
I will be back within three days at the latest.

820
01:08:53,130 --> 01:08:56,070
The Nameless's hideout?

821
01:08:56,770 --> 01:09:00,040
Six years ago, at Mount Gamak...

822
01:09:00,570 --> 01:09:03,180
I saw a woman in white mourning with The Nameless.

823
01:09:03,580 --> 01:09:04,850
Let me go!

824
01:09:08,980 --> 01:09:09,980
Wait a minute.

825
01:09:12,020 --> 01:09:13,250
The woman in white.

826
01:09:14,450 --> 01:09:15,460
The letter.

827
01:10:39,470 --> 01:10:41,580
I hear they are about to issue a Marriage Ban.

828
01:10:44,850 --> 01:10:47,610
- A ribbon? - If I become strong enough...

829
01:10:48,180 --> 01:10:49,750
to protect you after passing the exam,

830
01:10:50,580 --> 01:10:53,120
can I be your husband then?

831
01:11:00,530 --> 01:11:02,060
Can you not please just live?

832
01:11:03,130 --> 01:11:04,600
Please just live.

833
01:11:06,130 --> 01:11:07,500
I beg of you, please live.

834
01:11:59,350 --> 01:12:00,550
He is my son.

835
01:12:08,360 --> 01:12:09,500
Now I...

836
01:12:10,700 --> 01:12:13,100
have become more powerful than I could have ever imagined,

837
01:12:15,770 --> 01:12:17,700
and yet, you can never return to me.

838
01:12:22,080 --> 01:12:23,110
So what am I...

839
01:12:25,350 --> 01:12:27,010
supposed to do now?

840
01:12:46,030 --> 01:12:48,170
The security is very tight there. It is suspicious,

841
01:12:49,200 --> 01:12:50,200
sir.

842
01:12:51,510 --> 01:12:53,440
We should get a closer look.

843
01:13:00,710 --> 01:13:01,820
It is the Left State Councillor.

844
01:13:39,050 --> 01:13:40,050
Mother.

845
01:13:54,030 --> 01:13:58,810
(Moon River)

846
01:14:13,950 --> 01:14:16,360
The secret pact is certain to be wherever Her Highness is.

847
01:14:16,420 --> 01:14:18,730
Can you take the secret pact and go straight to the capital...

848
01:14:18,730 --> 01:14:20,130
once we find it?

849
01:14:20,190 --> 01:14:22,330
I appoint the daughter of the Left State Councillor Kim Han Chul...

850
01:14:22,330 --> 01:14:24,330
as the Crown Princess.

851
01:14:24,460 --> 01:14:26,530
You shattered me, Father.

852
01:14:26,530 --> 01:14:29,440
Now all my pieces can do is cut my husband.

853
01:14:29,740 --> 01:14:33,570
He will come. He said he would, so I know he will.

854
01:14:34,340 --> 01:14:38,310
Because this is revenge for the two of us, me and Dal.

855
01:14:53,190 --> 01:14:58,030
(Moon River)
