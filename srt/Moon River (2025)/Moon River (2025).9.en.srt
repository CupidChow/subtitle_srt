1
00:00:08,993 --> 00:00:10,323
(All people, incidents, and backgrounds...)

2
00:00:10,393 --> 00:00:11,623
(in this drama are fictitious and unrelated to reality.)

3
00:00:11,693 --> 00:00:12,963
(Also, children and animals were filmed under production guidelines.)

4
00:00:16,393 --> 00:00:18,133
How could I ever be angry with you?

5
00:00:19,403 --> 00:00:21,673
You are the sole exception to all my anger.

6
00:00:23,873 --> 00:00:26,343
I meant to tell you after my revenge was complete.

7
00:00:29,413 --> 00:00:31,043
But you are having such foolish thoughts,

8
00:00:33,753 --> 00:00:35,283
so I have no choice but to tell you now.

9
00:00:39,653 --> 00:00:40,653
That I...

10
00:00:52,133 --> 00:00:53,663
I am very deeply...

11
00:00:56,673 --> 00:00:57,673
in love...

12
00:01:00,073 --> 00:01:01,073
with you, Park Dal.

13
00:01:11,283 --> 00:01:12,283
Me too.

14
00:02:52,423 --> 00:02:55,453
Wait. You found the Jimjo in Mount Inwang Cave?

15
00:02:56,123 --> 00:02:58,323
It was right under our noses. Goodness.

16
00:02:58,523 --> 00:02:59,523
Tell me about it.

17
00:03:00,593 --> 00:03:03,433
So, since you have found its habitat,

18
00:03:03,833 --> 00:03:05,363
does that mean you can get the Left State Councillor?

19
00:03:05,703 --> 00:03:08,673
The Choraengi Mask set off a bomb,

20
00:03:09,233 --> 00:03:10,673
and it wiped out all traces of the Jimjo.

21
00:03:10,943 --> 00:03:13,803
Did you not say the Chief Court Lady was the one in the Choraengi Mask?

22
00:03:14,273 --> 00:03:16,113
It turns out there was another one.

23
00:03:16,373 --> 00:03:19,313
What? Then why did you not catch him?

24
00:03:19,483 --> 00:03:23,213
He knew the cave's layout well, shook off 12 of our men,

25
00:03:23,813 --> 00:03:25,153
then he blew himself up inside.

26
00:03:28,293 --> 00:03:29,653
So, what do we do now?

27
00:03:30,593 --> 00:03:32,023
The Choraengi Mask is dead,

28
00:03:32,593 --> 00:03:33,793
and the cave collapsed.

29
00:03:34,393 --> 00:03:35,393
And because of me,

30
00:03:36,233 --> 00:03:38,163
the Jimjo is gone forever.

31
00:03:38,403 --> 00:03:39,403
Gosh.

32
00:03:39,763 --> 00:03:42,033
You have to make me seem pathetic, do you not?

33
00:03:42,873 --> 00:03:44,443
Every time I save you,

34
00:03:44,743 --> 00:03:47,173
just say I was amazing or that you have fallen for me.

35
00:03:47,713 --> 00:03:48,973
That would be enough.

36
00:03:51,013 --> 00:03:52,843
You are not wrong, but...

37
00:03:57,013 --> 00:03:59,253
You just stop there.

38
00:04:00,153 --> 00:04:01,153
For my part,

39
00:04:02,593 --> 00:04:06,063
I will just be grateful you are alive, and we will leave it at that.

40
00:04:06,663 --> 00:04:07,663
Okay?

41
00:04:12,363 --> 00:04:14,603
- How is your back?
- It is all better now.

42
00:04:15,203 --> 00:04:16,903
Good. That is all that matters.

43
00:04:17,573 --> 00:04:18,573
Let us get some sleep.

44
00:04:26,013 --> 00:04:27,013
Gosh...

45
00:04:28,253 --> 00:04:29,253
Gosh...

46
00:04:30,153 --> 00:04:31,523
Are you trying to squeeze the life out of me?

47
00:04:32,083 --> 00:04:34,323
Why are you hugging me so tight?

48
00:04:34,623 --> 00:04:35,623
You have no idea...

49
00:04:36,093 --> 00:04:37,363
what my lonely nights have been like.

50
00:04:39,563 --> 00:04:44,133
Say what you will, I will not let go. So hug me back tight.

51
00:05:02,013 --> 00:05:04,723
The Crown Prince's Concubine used the chick to lure its mother,

52
00:05:05,123 --> 00:05:08,023
and His Royal Highness killed the Jimjo himself?

53
00:05:10,923 --> 00:05:12,323
Because of one woman,

54
00:05:13,423 --> 00:05:15,793
five years of hard work went down the drain.

55
00:05:16,233 --> 00:05:18,502
- Sir?
- Take the carcass,

56
00:05:18,503 --> 00:05:20,033
and clean up the scene well.

57
00:05:20,303 --> 00:05:21,303
Yes, sir.

58
00:05:24,843 --> 00:05:29,473
A young Jimjo's venom is too weak to serve as evidence.

59
00:05:30,273 --> 00:05:33,913
Now that the Jimjo and all traces of it are gone,

60
00:05:34,413 --> 00:05:35,782
the truth of what happened in the Gyesa Year...

61
00:05:35,783 --> 00:05:38,353
will remain a secret forever.

62
00:05:38,483 --> 00:05:42,023
(Chapter Nine: Curiosity, There Are No Secrets)

63
00:06:59,263 --> 00:07:00,303
Gosh.

64
00:07:02,773 --> 00:07:04,473
It is disturbing Dal's sleep.

65
00:07:12,443 --> 00:07:13,613
Hey, you punk!

66
00:07:23,193 --> 00:07:26,763
- Go get that thing.
- "That thing"?

67
00:07:32,033 --> 00:07:33,063
No...

68
00:07:41,813 --> 00:07:45,283
Royal Mother! Why are you...

69
00:07:45,683 --> 00:07:49,683
Royal Mother! What is happening?

70
00:07:50,613 --> 00:07:51,623
Royal Mother

71
00:07:52,653 --> 00:07:53,653
Royal Mother.

72
00:08:13,503 --> 00:08:14,943
I am back in my own body now.

73
00:08:16,943 --> 00:08:19,583
So why do I keep dreaming about the Crown Princess?

74
00:08:29,593 --> 00:08:30,593
What?

75
00:09:04,463 --> 00:09:05,863
Now that the Jimjo is dead...

76
00:09:06,293 --> 00:09:08,363
and the Mount Inwang Cave lies in ruins,

77
00:09:09,233 --> 00:09:10,793
what do you plan to do?

78
00:09:12,303 --> 00:09:15,833
The Jimjo will be dismissed as a tragic omen.

79
00:09:17,603 --> 00:09:19,903
The people are in an uproar over this monstrous bird,

80
00:09:20,343 --> 00:09:23,443
so you should hold an exorcism rite to appease them.

81
00:09:23,743 --> 00:09:24,783
An exorcism rite?

82
00:09:26,083 --> 00:09:28,883
So the Jimjo is a curse sent from the skies?

83
00:09:29,253 --> 00:09:30,413
Otherwise,

84
00:09:30,883 --> 00:09:35,653
someone dared send a Jimjo into Your Majesty's palace.

85
00:09:36,023 --> 00:09:38,863
Are you suggesting this is an act of treason?

86
00:09:39,123 --> 00:09:42,633
So whoever sent the Jimjo is a traitor?

87
00:09:44,033 --> 00:09:45,103
So that is it.

88
00:09:45,603 --> 00:09:48,803
The reason he made me release the Jimjo myself.

89
00:09:55,443 --> 00:09:58,183
The Book of Rites is clear.

90
00:09:58,813 --> 00:09:59,943
According to it,

91
00:10:00,283 --> 00:10:02,682
A monarch in mourning should not rejoice,

92
00:10:02,683 --> 00:10:05,023
and one should not hold celebrations during a time of mourning.

93
00:10:06,283 --> 00:10:07,723
The Left State Councillor's point is a valid one.

94
00:10:08,023 --> 00:10:09,153
We will hold an exorcism rite,

95
00:10:10,193 --> 00:10:11,723
and I will suspend the Royal Wedding.

96
00:10:16,193 --> 00:10:19,833
What? What are you talking about? The Royal Wedding is in five days.

97
00:10:20,233 --> 00:10:21,702
How can you suspend the wedding?

98
00:10:21,703 --> 00:10:24,803
He is right, Your Highness. Comparing the Jimjo...

99
00:10:25,173 --> 00:10:26,903
to a monarch in mourning is not appropriate.

100
00:10:27,073 --> 00:10:31,713
Even past kings postponed feasts for hail, drought, or poor harvests.

101
00:10:31,783 --> 00:10:32,783
So holding the Royal Wedding...

102
00:10:33,283 --> 00:10:35,783
in the face of an omen like this...

103
00:10:36,153 --> 00:10:37,823
would be utterly absurd, would it not?

104
00:10:44,623 --> 00:10:46,893
Now that I have stopped the wedding using the omen as an excuse,

105
00:10:47,293 --> 00:10:48,462
the Left State Councillor will soon claim...

106
00:10:48,463 --> 00:10:49,662
the Jimjo was a man-made disaster...

107
00:10:49,663 --> 00:10:51,833
and try to find someone to take the fall.

108
00:10:52,303 --> 00:10:54,773
Yes, he will likely pin it on the former Chief Court Lady Jo.

109
00:10:54,903 --> 00:10:56,203
The Jimjo's cave on Mount Inwang...

110
00:10:56,573 --> 00:10:58,143
is connected to Jo's brewery.

111
00:10:58,543 --> 00:11:01,373
That brewery once belonged to the Left State Councillor.

112
00:11:02,773 --> 00:11:06,783
But this deed lists someone else as the seller.

113
00:11:07,113 --> 00:11:08,583
So, I should find this person?

114
00:11:09,353 --> 00:11:12,523
Find proof the Left State Councillor sold the brewery to this man.

115
00:11:13,223 --> 00:11:15,653
And after I find him, what is next?

116
00:11:16,153 --> 00:11:17,153
After that,

117
00:11:20,823 --> 00:11:21,833
be happy.

118
00:11:24,733 --> 00:11:25,962
Once the Left State Councillor is arrested,

119
00:11:25,963 --> 00:11:27,733
the Royal Wedding will be cancelled.

120
00:11:28,073 --> 00:11:30,573
That is when you must run away with the Crown Princess Consort.

121
00:11:31,073 --> 00:11:33,303
- Gang.
- Live well, wherever you go.

122
00:11:34,373 --> 00:11:35,613
Do not be in pain anymore,

123
00:11:36,843 --> 00:11:37,943
and do not be lonely.

124
00:11:46,653 --> 00:11:48,853
What will you do now?

125
00:11:49,023 --> 00:11:51,163
We fell for the Crown Prince's trap.

126
00:11:51,223 --> 00:11:53,562
The Crown Prince and his concubine are so obviously in love,

127
00:11:53,563 --> 00:11:54,993
the whole palace can tell.

128
00:11:55,193 --> 00:11:58,963
And now with the wedding postponed, what if the concubine gets pregnant?

129
00:11:59,603 --> 00:12:01,673
Would that not be a total disaster?

130
00:12:02,103 --> 00:12:03,103
Our Crown Prince...

131
00:12:03,833 --> 00:12:06,643
has matured a great deal in the meantime.

132
00:12:06,743 --> 00:12:10,213
This is hardly the time to stand around admiring him!

133
00:12:10,613 --> 00:12:11,613
However,

134
00:12:13,013 --> 00:12:15,413
a tree that grows higher than the ceiling...

135
00:12:17,153 --> 00:12:18,783
must be chopped down.

136
00:12:26,123 --> 00:12:28,693
I should be going now.

137
00:12:34,633 --> 00:12:35,773
Come on.

138
00:12:36,303 --> 00:12:38,443
Gang, how can you be so careless with my wedding gift?

139
00:12:41,513 --> 00:12:43,043
- Wedding gift?
- Yes.

140
00:12:43,243 --> 00:12:45,313
U Hui trusts me with her life.

141
00:12:45,483 --> 00:12:47,883
I cannot give her a grand affair, but we should have a ceremony.

142
00:12:48,853 --> 00:12:52,023
A ceremony? Is that really what matters?

143
00:12:53,183 --> 00:12:54,183
Gang.

144
00:12:54,423 --> 00:12:56,923
When you buy a house, do you sign a deed or not?

145
00:12:57,493 --> 00:12:59,223
When you buy land, do you register the title or not?

146
00:12:59,463 --> 00:13:02,393
We were talking weddings. Why bring up houses and land now?

147
00:13:02,593 --> 00:13:04,703
That is what a wedding is all about.

148
00:13:06,133 --> 00:13:07,733
It is declaring ourselves husband and wife...

149
00:13:08,173 --> 00:13:09,403
before all the deities of the skies and earth.

150
00:13:09,703 --> 00:13:13,603
It means no one can tear us apart. It is a thumbprint on a contract.

151
00:13:16,213 --> 00:13:19,413
- That is what it is all about?
- Yes.

152
00:13:19,483 --> 00:13:21,353
- Really?
- Yes.

153
00:13:23,383 --> 00:13:24,853
Really?

154
00:13:38,863 --> 00:13:39,903
Have you been waiting long?

155
00:13:40,563 --> 00:13:42,173
I just got here myself.

156
00:13:43,103 --> 00:13:45,243
What is that you have there?

157
00:13:45,873 --> 00:13:48,913
Oh, Gang gave me his word.

158
00:13:49,613 --> 00:13:52,313
When this is all finished, we will leave together.

159
00:13:52,583 --> 00:13:53,943
I got this for you.

160
00:13:55,883 --> 00:13:57,083
I hope you like it.

161
00:14:01,153 --> 00:14:02,153
You do not like it?

162
00:14:02,353 --> 00:14:05,023
If I cared for riches and jewels, I would have stayed where I was.

163
00:14:06,063 --> 00:14:08,493
If I only wanted you for your title, I would have left a long time ago.

164
00:14:11,063 --> 00:14:12,633
Next time, instead of a wedding gift,

165
00:14:13,233 --> 00:14:15,033
bring me my father's downfall.

166
00:14:19,903 --> 00:14:21,873
I cannot leave right away either.

167
00:14:22,943 --> 00:14:25,283
Because the one who most wants the Left State Councillor's downfall...

168
00:14:26,843 --> 00:14:29,383
- is me.
- Do you have a plan?

169
00:14:29,783 --> 00:14:31,352
I am looking for the man who sold the brewery...

170
00:14:31,353 --> 00:14:32,983
to the former Chief Court Lady.

171
00:14:33,653 --> 00:14:36,753
Was it not my father who sold the brewery?

172
00:14:38,093 --> 00:14:39,622
Before selling it to her,

173
00:14:39,623 --> 00:14:42,633
he sold it to someone named Yun Gye Sim.

174
00:14:43,433 --> 00:14:45,563
Does that name sound familiar?

175
00:14:46,633 --> 00:14:48,603
No, I do not know.

176
00:14:49,473 --> 00:14:52,943
I see. I did not expect it to be that easy.

177
00:14:53,143 --> 00:14:56,543
Either way, I will prove that the Left State Councillor...

178
00:14:56,743 --> 00:14:58,383
is the master of the Jimjo.

179
00:15:00,113 --> 00:15:01,113
But...

180
00:15:01,953 --> 00:15:03,313
are you sure you will be all right with this?

181
00:15:04,623 --> 00:15:07,523
He is still your father, after all. Are you sure you are okay?

182
00:15:08,523 --> 00:15:10,793
He has never once considered me his daughter,

183
00:15:11,663 --> 00:15:13,663
so it is nothing for me to abandon him as my father.

184
00:15:15,063 --> 00:15:16,063
That is a heartbreaking thing to say.

185
00:15:29,913 --> 00:15:32,643
Just wait a little longer. I will come for you soon.

186
00:15:33,543 --> 00:15:36,613
Brother, friend, father, and husband...

187
00:15:37,453 --> 00:15:38,953
I will be all of those things for you.

188
00:15:58,443 --> 00:16:00,943
What? A hundred pairs of flower shoes?

189
00:16:01,343 --> 00:16:04,543
Are these shoes for a centipede or something?

190
00:16:11,013 --> 00:16:12,283
What are you talking about, you punk?

191
00:16:15,223 --> 00:16:16,623
Enough with the smart remarks,

192
00:16:17,453 --> 00:16:18,823
and bring me some paper and a brush.

193
00:16:19,663 --> 00:16:21,433
I have a special order for you.

194
00:16:24,833 --> 00:16:26,903
There we go.

195
00:16:29,373 --> 00:16:30,373
Take a look.

196
00:16:34,073 --> 00:16:36,973
- Wait, is this...
- Yes, as you can see...

197
00:16:37,043 --> 00:16:38,683
Is this not the number eight from the West?

198
00:16:39,513 --> 00:16:42,652
How would you know Western numbers, Your Highness?

199
00:16:42,653 --> 00:16:44,353
What? A number?

200
00:16:44,383 --> 00:16:47,453
What is this fly in the middle?

201
00:16:49,523 --> 00:16:50,953
It is a flower.

202
00:16:52,893 --> 00:16:54,093
A skewer?

203
00:16:54,393 --> 00:16:56,433
Oh, a silkworm cocoon!

204
00:16:57,533 --> 00:17:00,503
Not a silkworm cocoon, a flower!

205
00:17:00,863 --> 00:17:04,773
Look! A flower in the middle. These two rings.

206
00:17:05,103 --> 00:17:06,873
A double ring with a flower design, you idiot.

207
00:17:07,543 --> 00:17:11,813
- Is it not?
- It is!

208
00:17:13,843 --> 00:17:15,853
I just do not get...

209
00:17:15,953 --> 00:17:19,153
why he keeps drawing such things and acting so proud.

210
00:17:19,623 --> 00:17:20,723
Maybe because he was spoiled rotten?

211
00:17:28,133 --> 00:17:29,963
This will be a gift for my Royal Concubine,

212
00:17:30,493 --> 00:17:33,763
so tell the finest artisan to do their absolute best work.

213
00:17:36,733 --> 00:17:37,733
So dazzling.

214
00:17:40,173 --> 00:17:41,173
So dazzling.

215
00:17:43,043 --> 00:17:44,043
So dazzling.

216
00:17:47,113 --> 00:17:48,153
You are that happy?

217
00:17:48,783 --> 00:17:50,083
No.

218
00:17:50,513 --> 00:17:52,323
It is the umbrella that is beautiful.

219
00:17:52,783 --> 00:17:55,693
The umbrella is just like a flower.

220
00:17:56,253 --> 00:17:58,693
I feel like I have seen this flower somewhere.

221
00:17:58,993 --> 00:18:00,023
What was it called again?

222
00:18:00,423 --> 00:18:03,693
Then, should you not do something to thank His Royal Highness?

223
00:18:04,833 --> 00:18:05,833
Thank him?

224
00:18:08,233 --> 00:18:10,903
He is the Crown Prince. What could he possibly need?

225
00:18:11,743 --> 00:18:13,643
Besides, he is no ordinary Crown Prince.

226
00:18:14,143 --> 00:18:16,443
He even has his own wardrobe room at the Royal Office of Attire.

227
00:18:18,543 --> 00:18:20,383
For someone like that, it is the thought that counts.

228
00:18:21,983 --> 00:18:23,083
The thought?

229
00:18:25,153 --> 00:18:26,753
- Your Highness.
- Your Highness.

230
00:18:27,423 --> 00:18:30,593
Royal Concubine. What brings you here, Your Highness?

231
00:18:30,653 --> 00:18:31,663
It is just that...

232
00:18:32,123 --> 00:18:33,963
I am trying to make something.

233
00:18:34,593 --> 00:18:37,463
Do you know what food His Royal Highness enjoys?

234
00:18:57,153 --> 00:18:58,153
Hey, wait a second.

235
00:18:59,923 --> 00:19:01,053
What happened to your hands?

236
00:19:01,323 --> 00:19:04,053
It is nothing. I just scraped it a little.

237
00:19:06,423 --> 00:19:07,423
Goodness!

238
00:19:12,203 --> 00:19:14,433
- It is hot.
- You said it was just a scrape.

239
00:19:14,703 --> 00:19:17,173
Five of your ten fingers are all wrapped up in bandages?

240
00:19:18,073 --> 00:19:20,173
This is unacceptable. I am calling the Royal Physician.

241
00:19:20,473 --> 00:19:22,412
- Is there anyone?
- It is fine!

242
00:19:22,413 --> 00:19:23,873
Do not make such a fuss.

243
00:19:24,413 --> 00:19:26,943
- Hurry up and try it.
- What do you mean it is nothing?

244
00:19:27,883 --> 00:19:29,853
To think you went to so much trouble making this...

245
00:19:30,583 --> 00:19:32,752
- It is just heartbreaking.
- Come on.

246
00:19:32,753 --> 00:19:34,623
But you have done so much for me,

247
00:19:34,853 --> 00:19:35,853
and you have saved me so many times,

248
00:19:35,923 --> 00:19:38,023
so I wanted to do something for you, and I worked hard.

249
00:19:38,093 --> 00:19:39,522
But you keep scolding me. Forget it.

250
00:19:39,523 --> 00:19:40,863
- Do not eat it.
- No.

251
00:19:43,133 --> 00:19:44,193
Is that what this was about?

252
00:19:45,763 --> 00:19:47,163
And I had no idea.

253
00:19:48,733 --> 00:19:49,733
All right.

254
00:19:50,003 --> 00:19:52,643
Let me taste the pumpkin porridge you sacrificed five fingers for.

255
00:20:02,813 --> 00:20:05,223
How is it? Is it any good?

256
00:20:05,623 --> 00:20:07,753
I did not get to taste-test it while I was making it.

257
00:20:10,523 --> 00:20:11,523
It is delicious.

258
00:20:12,223 --> 00:20:13,293
Really?

259
00:20:13,623 --> 00:20:16,193
That is a relief. It is my first time making it.

260
00:20:16,463 --> 00:20:17,463
Hold on a second.

261
00:20:18,193 --> 00:20:20,663
It is a shame to eat this porridge all by myself.

262
00:20:21,363 --> 00:20:25,503
What do you think about sharing some with Shin Won and Se Dol?

263
00:20:25,643 --> 00:20:29,143
As if I would not think of that. I already gave them each a bowl.

264
00:21:08,243 --> 00:21:09,283
That was delicious.

265
00:21:10,213 --> 00:21:13,653
It is so delicious that I am sad to be on the last bite.

266
00:21:14,353 --> 00:21:15,453
You wish there was more?

267
00:21:16,093 --> 00:21:19,593
Good thing I saved a portion for myself.

268
00:21:20,723 --> 00:21:24,393
For me, just watching you enjoy it is enough to make me full.

269
00:21:28,233 --> 00:21:31,903
But just because the wedding is off, does not mean it is completely over.

270
00:21:32,303 --> 00:21:34,673
What happens to Grand Prince Je Un and the Crown Prince Consort?

271
00:21:37,343 --> 00:21:38,343
Your Royal Highness.

272
00:21:38,983 --> 00:21:39,983
Your Royal Highness?

273
00:21:40,343 --> 00:21:41,343
Yes?

274
00:21:42,153 --> 00:21:43,953
Why are you in a cold sweat like that?

275
00:21:45,853 --> 00:21:47,423
It is just hot in here.

276
00:21:54,293 --> 00:21:55,863
But your hands and earlobes are ice-cold.

277
00:21:56,893 --> 00:21:58,503
Then it is because I am cold.

278
00:21:59,403 --> 00:22:02,003
Make up your mind. Are you hot or are you cold?

279
00:22:02,433 --> 00:22:03,533
Well, it is...

280
00:22:03,603 --> 00:22:06,643
You ate two bowls of that vile stuff?

281
00:22:06,673 --> 00:22:08,273
How could you finish that thing?

282
00:22:08,303 --> 00:22:09,973
Even Mangdeok would not touch it.

283
00:22:10,843 --> 00:22:12,843
That "vile stuff" you are referring to...

284
00:22:13,143 --> 00:22:15,383
Is it the pumpkin porridge I gave you?

285
00:22:16,383 --> 00:22:18,383
And to think I went out of my way to prepare bowls for both of you.

286
00:22:18,823 --> 00:22:20,453
What were you thinking?

287
00:22:21,353 --> 00:22:24,223
Why does Dal have to be a good cook on top of everything else?

288
00:22:24,823 --> 00:22:26,793
It is not like she entered the palace to be our cook.

289
00:22:27,963 --> 00:22:28,963
It was delicious.

290
00:22:29,863 --> 00:22:33,302
Then you should have said something. Why force it down like an idiot?

291
00:22:33,303 --> 00:22:35,133
So what if I am a bit of an idiot?

292
00:22:35,703 --> 00:22:37,103
As long as it made you happy, that is all that matters.

293
00:22:37,903 --> 00:22:38,903
It was delicious.

294
00:22:39,873 --> 00:22:41,173
You are not quite better yet, are you?

295
00:22:43,043 --> 00:22:46,383
- Follow me.
- What? Where are you taking me?

296
00:22:46,783 --> 00:22:47,843
In the middle of the day?

297
00:22:48,813 --> 00:22:49,913
Do not follow us.

298
00:22:50,383 --> 00:22:53,353
- Go on.
- It is completely blocked up.

299
00:22:53,783 --> 00:22:56,493
You did not have to get sick over that. Gosh.

300
00:22:58,123 --> 00:23:00,423
Doing pointless things is what romance is.

301
00:23:00,693 --> 00:23:03,033
Romance? Give me a break.

302
00:23:07,363 --> 00:23:09,333
It is the middle of the day,

303
00:23:09,703 --> 00:23:12,373
and a couple is sitting side by side in a private room.

304
00:23:13,303 --> 00:23:16,813
Plus, they are holding hands and caressing their fingers.

305
00:23:17,043 --> 00:23:18,843
This is what you call romance, is it not?

306
00:23:18,913 --> 00:23:21,143
This is not for some impure reason.

307
00:23:21,583 --> 00:23:23,583
It is purely for therapeutic purposes.

308
00:23:24,513 --> 00:23:27,623
They say you will not get sick if your body stays warm.

309
00:23:27,683 --> 00:23:29,453
If being warm is so good for you,

310
00:23:30,323 --> 00:23:31,893
we should not just be holding hands.

311
00:23:35,333 --> 00:23:37,533
Maybe we should try something else.

312
00:23:40,133 --> 00:23:42,333
I was already planning on it.

313
00:23:43,003 --> 00:23:45,573
Close your eyes. You might be surprised.

314
00:23:47,603 --> 00:23:49,973
What? I have to close my eyes?

315
00:23:52,783 --> 00:23:55,413
Fine. Do whatever you want.

316
00:23:55,683 --> 00:23:56,683
All right.

317
00:24:04,253 --> 00:24:06,163
Just trust the best healer from Boryeong.

318
00:24:06,563 --> 00:24:07,563
What?

319
00:24:20,743 --> 00:24:21,743
No, do not.

320
00:24:44,733 --> 00:24:46,563
There we go.

321
00:24:47,063 --> 00:24:49,403
- You are doing great.
- No!

322
00:24:50,333 --> 00:24:51,433
Did you call for me?

323
00:24:55,073 --> 00:24:56,143
I did not.

324
00:24:56,913 --> 00:25:01,883
But just now, I heard "Se Dol."

325
00:25:05,483 --> 00:25:07,023
Were you not the one who called me?

326
00:25:07,083 --> 00:25:09,553
I said I did not. Now go get me a wet towel.

327
00:25:11,223 --> 00:25:13,993
Why am I always the one to see this? This is so frustrating.

328
00:25:35,883 --> 00:25:38,983
Your Royal Highness. Are you still pouting?

329
00:25:39,723 --> 00:25:40,783
I am not pouting.

330
00:25:41,323 --> 00:25:43,193
You certainly sound like you are.

331
00:25:43,723 --> 00:25:45,053
I said I am not.

332
00:25:46,463 --> 00:25:49,033
Okay. I am sorry for teasing you.

333
00:25:49,593 --> 00:25:52,503
I have apologised. Come here so we can clean your hand.

334
00:25:55,003 --> 00:25:56,702
Hey, what are you doing?

335
00:25:56,703 --> 00:25:58,073
Why are you dunking your hands when they are hurt?

336
00:25:58,133 --> 00:26:00,003
It will get infected. Gosh.

337
00:26:23,933 --> 00:26:27,963
Goodness.

338
00:26:30,033 --> 00:26:34,243
I have been eating well and on time, so I cannot be collapsing already.

339
00:26:38,573 --> 00:26:39,583
What?

340
00:26:47,683 --> 00:26:49,522
- Oh, no. What is going on?
- Calm down.

341
00:26:49,523 --> 00:26:51,352
- Did we switch bodies again?
- My body... Why is it over there?

342
00:26:51,353 --> 00:26:52,393
What do we do?

343
00:26:52,723 --> 00:26:54,323
- Your Royal Highness.
- Your Royal Highness.

344
00:27:00,033 --> 00:27:04,533
- Who do I look like to you?
- Tell me who you see right now.

345
00:27:07,043 --> 00:27:08,073
Well...

346
00:27:08,673 --> 00:27:10,472
Your Highness and the Royal Concubine...

347
00:27:10,473 --> 00:27:11,573
Darn! So...

348
00:27:11,873 --> 00:27:16,313
So you are saying you see me as Dal, and you see her as me?

349
00:27:19,583 --> 00:27:20,723
What in the...

350
00:27:20,783 --> 00:27:25,463
Oh, come on. Not this "I am you, you are me" stuff.

351
00:27:25,523 --> 00:27:26,793
There you go, playing your games again.

352
00:27:27,223 --> 00:27:29,633
Is this your first time dating or something?

353
00:27:29,963 --> 00:27:31,693
Why are you making such a fuss?

354
00:27:33,003 --> 00:27:34,403
Are you trying to make fun of this lonely old eunuch?

355
00:27:34,463 --> 00:27:35,903
Lonely eunuch? What nonsense.

356
00:27:35,973 --> 00:27:38,203
Well, then, we will let you two enjoy yourselves.

357
00:27:41,473 --> 00:27:43,843
My lady, the Left State Councillor has come for you.

358
00:27:54,753 --> 00:27:56,953
Left State Councillor, what brings you all the way here?

359
00:27:57,193 --> 00:27:59,823
Last night, you took...

360
00:28:00,723 --> 00:28:04,793
the Jimjo chick from the prison to lure its mother.

361
00:28:04,863 --> 00:28:06,363
We have received this testimony.

362
00:28:07,133 --> 00:28:09,433
You will have to come with us for questioning.

363
00:28:09,603 --> 00:28:11,572
As I recall, the Royal Concubine is under...

364
00:28:11,573 --> 00:28:12,803
the Crown Prince's Palace's authority.

365
00:28:13,143 --> 00:28:14,803
By what authority do you presume to take her?

366
00:28:15,343 --> 00:28:17,343
The fate of the nation is at stake.

367
00:28:18,043 --> 00:28:19,843
Please grant us your permission, Your Royal Highness.

368
00:28:20,383 --> 00:28:23,313
I have nothing to be ashamed of, so of course I will go.

369
00:28:24,353 --> 00:28:25,353
Let us go.

370
00:28:29,093 --> 00:28:31,823
I will be back soon, so please do not worry.

371
00:28:40,463 --> 00:28:44,503
How did you know of the Secret Prison and the Jimjo chick?

372
00:28:44,973 --> 00:28:47,873
The former Chief Court Lady tried to force an infertility drug on me.

373
00:28:47,943 --> 00:28:49,913
She had me abducted and taken to the Secret Prison.

374
00:28:50,213 --> 00:28:51,443
That is when I found out.

375
00:28:52,083 --> 00:28:54,983
About both the Secret Prison and the Jimjo chick.

376
00:28:56,153 --> 00:28:59,753
If you do not believe me, ask the Queen Dowager yourself.

377
00:29:01,753 --> 00:29:04,953
By the way, I wonder if the Queen Dowager...

378
00:29:05,423 --> 00:29:08,693
has heard the rumours circulating about the Jimjo Poison.

379
00:29:09,393 --> 00:29:11,693
She is using the Queen Dowager's backing...

380
00:29:12,333 --> 00:29:14,933
to dig into the Gyesa Year Incident?

381
00:29:15,873 --> 00:29:16,873
Then,

382
00:29:17,633 --> 00:29:21,643
why did you lure the mother with its young?

383
00:29:21,943 --> 00:29:25,343
As rumours of the Jimjo are causing unrest among the people,

384
00:29:25,483 --> 00:29:30,283
is it not wise to catch the creature and expose who is behind this?

385
00:29:30,753 --> 00:29:34,223
Is that not why you are investigating me now?

386
00:29:35,283 --> 00:29:37,253
To find the master of the Jimjo...

387
00:29:38,123 --> 00:29:40,093
who might just be a traitor.

388
00:29:49,633 --> 00:29:52,143
Thank you for indulging my discourtesy.

389
00:29:52,803 --> 00:29:53,803
Thanks to you,

390
00:29:54,203 --> 00:29:56,973
I now have a new lead, the former Chief Court Lady.

391
00:29:57,973 --> 00:30:00,183
I will now begin my investigation.

392
00:30:02,083 --> 00:30:05,153
How do you intend to investigate someone who is already dead?

393
00:30:05,483 --> 00:30:07,623
She must have had an accomplice.

394
00:30:08,323 --> 00:30:11,193
The mastermind behind it all,

395
00:30:12,193 --> 00:30:13,323
who could very well be a traitor.

396
00:30:19,063 --> 00:30:20,103
Good grief.

397
00:30:26,203 --> 00:30:28,643
How did it go? Are you all right?

398
00:30:29,113 --> 00:30:31,143
The Left State Councillor is doing just what I wanted.

399
00:30:31,713 --> 00:30:33,243
He said he is going to investigate the Chief Court Lady.

400
00:30:35,713 --> 00:30:38,953
Am I supposed to be glad that our bodies switched?

401
00:30:39,183 --> 00:30:40,253
Glad?

402
00:30:40,523 --> 00:30:42,053
How could swapping bodies possibly be a good thing?

403
00:30:42,723 --> 00:30:43,893
Why did we have to swap again?

404
00:30:51,033 --> 00:30:52,503
And I am stuck in these uncomfortable clothes again.

405
00:30:53,133 --> 00:30:55,673
- What good are these legs...
- River.

406
00:30:55,733 --> 00:30:56,733
If I cannot even use them properly?

407
00:30:56,734 --> 00:30:57,773
Rain.

408
00:31:01,943 --> 00:31:02,943
A basin?

409
00:31:10,513 --> 00:31:11,583
Our bodies...

410
00:31:13,583 --> 00:31:14,983
I am back in my own body.

411
00:31:17,323 --> 00:31:18,693
I think water has something to do with it.

412
00:31:22,123 --> 00:31:23,992
Why did we swap bodies again?

413
00:31:23,993 --> 00:31:26,233
You are too loud, so please be quiet. I am trying to think.

414
00:31:26,933 --> 00:31:29,403
Dal. If you were in my shoes, could you possibly be quiet?

415
00:31:30,273 --> 00:31:33,873
We kissed once, and we switched. We slept embraced for one night,

416
00:31:33,943 --> 00:31:35,243
and the next day, we swapped.

417
00:31:35,843 --> 00:31:37,043
I am a healthy man, you know!

418
00:31:39,683 --> 00:31:40,813
What was with you?

419
00:31:41,543 --> 00:31:44,183
This really stings. You were not fine at all.

420
00:31:46,623 --> 00:31:47,623
Blood?

421
00:32:09,213 --> 00:32:10,843
What is wrong?

422
00:32:16,783 --> 00:32:17,913
What are you doing now?

423
00:32:18,813 --> 00:32:20,223
Hold on.

424
00:32:31,693 --> 00:32:32,733
Dal.

425
00:32:33,163 --> 00:32:34,163
It is okay.

426
00:33:15,443 --> 00:33:17,843
What? Am I back?

427
00:33:25,613 --> 00:33:26,883
You are so adorable!

428
00:33:28,483 --> 00:33:31,053
See? It was blood and water.

429
00:33:31,723 --> 00:33:33,963
You and I both get a cut,

430
00:33:34,223 --> 00:33:36,192
and it gets washed with water.

431
00:33:36,193 --> 00:33:38,333
Ta-da! That is how we switch bodies.

432
00:33:39,733 --> 00:33:42,473
You silly girl. Why clap with your cut hand?

433
00:33:42,533 --> 00:33:45,333
I am just so happy! We finally know how to switch bodies.

434
00:33:45,403 --> 00:33:46,673
Are you not happy too?

435
00:33:47,743 --> 00:33:48,843
Hey.

436
00:33:50,413 --> 00:33:52,583
Your hand. That must hurt.

437
00:33:58,213 --> 00:34:01,253
Really, it is nothing.

438
00:34:01,923 --> 00:34:03,223
It is not a big deal.

439
00:34:03,623 --> 00:34:05,923
How is it not a big deal? Of course it is.

440
00:34:07,963 --> 00:34:10,063
Think about it.

441
00:34:10,893 --> 00:34:12,463
If you get hurt like this,

442
00:34:13,033 --> 00:34:14,933
I will spend all day worrying about you,

443
00:34:15,403 --> 00:34:16,403
and if I am worrying about you,

444
00:34:16,473 --> 00:34:18,203
I will not be able to focus on my royal duties,

445
00:34:18,473 --> 00:34:21,273
and if that happens, the nation will fall into ruin.

446
00:34:21,873 --> 00:34:23,573
Is that what you want? To see the nation fall?

447
00:34:23,873 --> 00:34:28,313
Do you want to rewrite history or something?

448
00:34:29,083 --> 00:34:31,153
Gosh, these lovely fingers...

449
00:34:41,223 --> 00:34:44,733
I hear you were neighbours who were close to Park Dal.

450
00:34:45,493 --> 00:34:48,133
Go to Hanyang and say exactly what I tell you.

451
00:34:48,463 --> 00:34:49,873
Do that, and no harm will come to you.

452
00:35:07,683 --> 00:35:09,122
I...

453
00:35:09,123 --> 00:35:11,193
I really do not know anything.

454
00:35:13,263 --> 00:35:14,363
I swear.

455
00:35:16,693 --> 00:35:18,233
You will have to know.

456
00:35:18,733 --> 00:35:19,803
Also,

457
00:35:20,203 --> 00:35:22,503
you will have to do exactly as I say.

458
00:35:24,233 --> 00:35:26,203
That is the only way the Chief Royal Secretary will live.

459
00:35:30,873 --> 00:35:34,443
Last night, the niece of the former Chief Court Lady Jo...

460
00:35:34,513 --> 00:35:36,753
confessed to releasing the Jimjo.

461
00:35:37,353 --> 00:35:40,723
In the Mount Inwang Cave, connected to Jo's brewery,

462
00:35:40,783 --> 00:35:42,623
they supposedly raised the Jimjo.

463
00:35:43,153 --> 00:35:45,493
Have you inspected the cave?

464
00:35:45,753 --> 00:35:47,523
It was blown up and is now blocked,

465
00:35:48,063 --> 00:35:50,733
but we discovered a tunnel that runs from the brewery...

466
00:35:50,793 --> 00:35:53,763
to the foot of Mount Inwang.

467
00:35:54,333 --> 00:35:55,333
So you are saying...

468
00:35:55,334 --> 00:35:58,073
the Chief Court Lady was the one behind the Jimjo?

469
00:35:58,933 --> 00:36:00,173
It would appear so.

470
00:36:02,513 --> 00:36:03,513
Then...

471
00:36:03,813 --> 00:36:06,043
let us conclude the Jimjo case...

472
00:36:06,113 --> 00:36:08,313
and resume the Royal Wedding, Your Highness.

473
00:36:08,383 --> 00:36:09,553
Not yet.

474
00:36:12,413 --> 00:36:15,153
She may have been plotting treason.

475
00:36:15,623 --> 00:36:17,423
A thorough investigation is required,

476
00:36:18,223 --> 00:36:19,293
so please grant me...

477
00:36:19,993 --> 00:36:21,893
a little more time.

478
00:36:22,693 --> 00:36:23,793
Left State Councillor.

479
00:36:24,333 --> 00:36:25,363
Left State Councillor.

480
00:36:29,473 --> 00:36:30,973
Do as you see fit, Left State Councillor.

481
00:36:35,303 --> 00:36:37,443
The Left State Councillor is stalling for time.

482
00:36:37,573 --> 00:36:38,973
I wonder what he is up to.

483
00:36:39,383 --> 00:36:41,113
Have you found the body of the man in the Choraengi Mask?

484
00:36:41,313 --> 00:36:43,753
They still have not cleared the cave entrance.

485
00:36:44,153 --> 00:36:45,983
It seems it will take more time.

486
00:36:46,883 --> 00:36:49,793
That might be for the best. We need more time anyway.

487
00:36:49,823 --> 00:36:52,293
Do not worry, Your Royal Highness. Just as you intended,

488
00:36:52,353 --> 00:36:53,723
everything is going according to plan.

489
00:36:54,123 --> 00:36:56,433
Right. I am just worrying for nothing.

490
00:36:56,663 --> 00:36:57,833
Your Royal Highness.

491
00:36:58,893 --> 00:37:00,363
It is I, Cha Eun Woo.

492
00:37:02,533 --> 00:37:04,502
As you commanded, Your Highness,

493
00:37:04,503 --> 00:37:06,803
I have tasked Joseon's finest artisan.

494
00:37:06,873 --> 00:37:09,143
I am certain you will be pleased with the result.

495
00:37:11,243 --> 00:37:12,443
Excellent.

496
00:37:13,443 --> 00:37:17,183
It is made exactly like the drawing I did that day. Right?

497
00:37:26,763 --> 00:37:29,933
Why the simple white robe, all of a sudden?

498
00:37:30,293 --> 00:37:34,303
For the same reason you are wearing a green top and a red skirt.

499
00:37:35,063 --> 00:37:36,803
I was just about to ask about that.

500
00:37:37,103 --> 00:37:40,903
Why this outfit all of a sudden? Is this a "personal colour analysis"?

501
00:37:41,543 --> 00:37:43,013
- No.
- Then what?

502
00:37:43,373 --> 00:37:45,142
Why did you insist I had to wear this...

503
00:37:45,143 --> 00:37:46,243
and make such a big deal about it?

504
00:37:48,443 --> 00:37:49,613
It is a bribe.

505
00:37:51,553 --> 00:37:52,823
I need to...

506
00:37:54,523 --> 00:37:55,993
ask your permission for something.

507
00:37:56,153 --> 00:37:57,893
What are you trying to say?

508
00:37:58,223 --> 00:37:59,723
A bribe, and now you need my permission?

509
00:38:05,063 --> 00:38:06,103
My lord.

510
00:38:12,303 --> 00:38:13,503
What?

511
00:38:16,373 --> 00:38:17,673
What is all this?

512
00:38:32,693 --> 00:38:34,293
What is all of this?

513
00:38:49,443 --> 00:38:52,613
Other than straw shoes, I want one in flower shoes.

514
00:38:53,313 --> 00:38:54,583
But a life where I wear flower shoes...

515
00:38:55,213 --> 00:38:56,613
and walk at a leisurely pace.

516
00:38:57,583 --> 00:38:58,613
That is the life I want.

517
00:38:59,983 --> 00:39:02,753
Flower shoes? I will buy you over a hundred pairs of them.

518
00:39:02,923 --> 00:39:05,853
I will buy you enough to fill an entire room.

519
00:40:25,933 --> 00:40:28,743
Why is this one all by itself in the middle?

520
00:40:32,313 --> 00:40:33,513
Inside your dream,

521
00:40:34,513 --> 00:40:35,913
I have placed my own.

522
00:41:02,673 --> 00:41:03,943
Is this a bribe too?

523
00:41:06,043 --> 00:41:07,043
Well,

524
00:41:07,883 --> 00:41:09,143
this is not a bribe.

525
00:41:12,653 --> 00:41:13,723
It is a wedding gift.

526
00:41:36,873 --> 00:41:39,243
Right now, I am...

527
00:41:44,583 --> 00:41:46,983
proposing to you.

528
00:41:55,863 --> 00:41:57,133
Not as the Crown Prince,

529
00:42:00,003 --> 00:42:01,133
but as a man,

530
00:42:02,633 --> 00:42:04,533
I am asking the woman I love...

531
00:42:06,033 --> 00:42:07,103
to be my one...

532
00:42:08,303 --> 00:42:09,643
and only partner.

533
00:42:12,713 --> 00:42:14,213
I am asking for your hand.

534
00:42:17,253 --> 00:42:18,253
Will you...

535
00:42:23,293 --> 00:42:25,093
be my wife?

536
00:42:58,353 --> 00:43:00,863
As Lee Gang and Park Dal wish to become husband and wife,

537
00:43:01,793 --> 00:43:03,663
we declare it before all the deities of the skies and earth.

538
00:43:05,033 --> 00:43:07,803
Please watch over this precious bond...

539
00:43:08,603 --> 00:43:10,133
and help us to protect it.

540
00:47:59,753 --> 00:48:03,023
Indeed. If she fails to find herself,

541
00:48:03,333 --> 00:48:05,733
then both this flower of fate and red thread of fate...

542
00:48:06,093 --> 00:48:08,503
will remain forever incomplete.

543
00:48:30,093 --> 00:48:31,293
Are you that happy?

544
00:48:31,693 --> 00:48:34,063
Gosh, you are awake?

545
00:48:40,103 --> 00:48:41,703
With you touching my face like this,

546
00:48:42,403 --> 00:48:45,633
- how could I possibly stay asleep?
- It is just that...

547
00:48:47,643 --> 00:48:48,843
I understand, though.

548
00:48:49,373 --> 00:48:50,673
It must be hard to believe.

549
00:48:51,843 --> 00:48:55,713
That the Crown Prince of this nation is completely and utterly yours.

550
00:48:56,613 --> 00:48:57,883
Your heart must be bursting.

551
00:48:59,453 --> 00:49:00,483
I get it.

552
00:49:01,623 --> 00:49:02,723
It is all right.

553
00:49:14,233 --> 00:49:15,333
What is wrong?

554
00:49:18,773 --> 00:49:22,303
Can I just step outside the palace for a bit?

555
00:49:22,803 --> 00:49:23,813
Where to?

556
00:49:25,073 --> 00:49:26,073
So, let me get this straight.

557
00:49:26,443 --> 00:49:28,583
First you were a eunuch, then a court lady,

558
00:49:28,843 --> 00:49:32,913
then the Crown Prince, and now you are his concubine?

559
00:49:36,083 --> 00:49:37,593
I do not even know anymore.

560
00:49:38,023 --> 00:49:39,953
Every time I blink, something changes.

561
00:49:40,293 --> 00:49:41,793
My head is about to explode.

562
00:49:42,623 --> 00:49:43,633
Your Highness.

563
00:49:43,963 --> 00:49:46,633
From now on, you must mind your words and deeds.

564
00:49:46,763 --> 00:49:49,263
Mom, why are you talking so formally all of a sudden?

565
00:49:49,433 --> 00:49:52,203
What is this? Are you already trying to suck up to her?

566
00:49:53,603 --> 00:49:57,343
Are you trying to win her over alone now that she is a royal concubine?

567
00:49:58,843 --> 00:49:59,843
My gosh.

568
00:50:01,283 --> 00:50:02,283
Your Highness.

569
00:50:02,743 --> 00:50:06,053
The sun is quite harsh. Please, do come inside.

570
00:50:06,113 --> 00:50:08,053
Dad! Not you too!

571
00:50:08,553 --> 00:50:10,653
Auntie, can you please do something about Mom and Dad?

572
00:50:12,823 --> 00:50:13,923
Let us just go inside for now.

573
00:50:16,833 --> 00:50:17,833
Unbelievable.

574
00:50:19,333 --> 00:50:20,333
Dal.

575
00:50:21,063 --> 00:50:22,063
No.

576
00:50:22,763 --> 00:50:26,333
I need to speak with the Royal Concubine alone.

577
00:50:26,943 --> 00:50:28,343
- All right, my lady.
- All right, my lady.

578
00:50:39,983 --> 00:50:42,352
Did you do something wrong? Why the bowed head?

579
00:50:42,353 --> 00:50:44,453
Because I did not listen to you,

580
00:50:46,053 --> 00:50:47,363
I have ended up here.

581
00:50:50,363 --> 00:50:52,693
If you have taken the wrong path, you can always just get off it.

582
00:50:57,703 --> 00:51:00,803
I will create an opportunity soon. Let us leave for Qing.

583
00:51:01,973 --> 00:51:02,973
I am sorry.

584
00:51:04,573 --> 00:51:05,573
Last night,

585
00:51:06,413 --> 00:51:08,413
I spent my wedding night with His Royal Highness.

586
00:51:09,543 --> 00:51:11,653
Now, I am going to stay by His Royal Highness's side,

587
00:51:12,453 --> 00:51:14,223
by my husband's side.

588
00:51:16,153 --> 00:51:19,093
You mean you formed a marital bond with the Crown Prince?

589
00:51:21,093 --> 00:51:22,093
Yes.

590
00:51:23,663 --> 00:51:24,663
So,

591
00:51:25,063 --> 00:51:27,463
you should take my parents and leave Hanyang now.

592
00:51:27,963 --> 00:51:30,873
You could be in danger if the Left State Councillor sees you.

593
00:51:32,003 --> 00:51:33,973
That is what I came here to tell you today.

594
00:51:39,213 --> 00:51:40,243
What?

595
00:51:40,613 --> 00:51:43,683
Being the Crown Prince's concubine is a good thing, is it not?

596
00:51:44,313 --> 00:51:45,713
Why the long face?

597
00:51:45,983 --> 00:51:47,052
He is right.

598
00:51:47,053 --> 00:51:49,883
A slave who fled Hanyang is now a Royal Concubine.

599
00:51:50,123 --> 00:51:52,153
What could be better than this?

600
00:51:52,453 --> 00:51:54,023
We do not have to be on the run anymore.

601
00:51:54,323 --> 00:51:57,033
Goodness, I can finally sleep well at night.

602
00:51:57,233 --> 00:51:58,233
Dal...

603
00:51:59,463 --> 00:52:01,433
should not be in the palace.

604
00:52:03,473 --> 00:52:06,703
So, what is that supposed to mean?

605
00:52:09,343 --> 00:52:10,643
Excuse me for a moment.

606
00:52:10,713 --> 00:52:12,743
Hey, where are you going? We are in the middle of talking.

607
00:52:13,913 --> 00:52:17,213
(Eunwol Pavilion)

608
00:52:21,353 --> 00:52:23,552
I asked to meet the Head Eunuch ages ago.

609
00:52:23,553 --> 00:52:25,253
Why have I not heard back?

610
00:52:25,693 --> 00:52:27,123
Did you even send the message?

611
00:52:27,623 --> 00:52:30,163
I did. Several times.

612
00:52:30,593 --> 00:52:32,463
But what can I do if there is no reply?

613
00:52:33,163 --> 00:52:34,163
That is why...

614
00:52:34,403 --> 00:52:36,363
I told you to just give me the message.

615
00:52:39,773 --> 00:52:40,803
Gang.

616
00:52:43,543 --> 00:52:44,613
Yeon Wol.

617
00:52:47,543 --> 00:52:49,183
Tell him Hong Nan of Eunwol Pavilion...

618
00:52:50,453 --> 00:52:52,413
is in Hanyang with Gang Yeon Wol.

619
00:52:53,623 --> 00:52:54,623
Pass on that message.

620
00:52:59,893 --> 00:53:03,163
The Jimjo's cave on Mount Inwang is connected to Jo's brewery.

621
00:53:03,463 --> 00:53:06,663
Find proof the Left State Councillor sold the brewery to this man.

622
00:53:09,433 --> 00:53:13,403
This house looks abandoned. Are you sure this is the place?

623
00:53:14,403 --> 00:53:16,443
According to this deed,

624
00:53:16,503 --> 00:53:19,413
the one who sold the brewery to the former Chief Court Lady lived here.

625
00:53:20,213 --> 00:53:21,213
What is this?

626
00:53:21,513 --> 00:53:23,713
What are you doing at an abandoned house?

627
00:53:25,213 --> 00:53:27,823
How long has this house been empty?

628
00:53:28,623 --> 00:53:30,793
About 5 or 6 years, I think?

629
00:53:31,153 --> 00:53:32,992
Where did they go?

630
00:53:32,993 --> 00:53:35,363
No idea. They skipped town at night.

631
00:53:37,433 --> 00:53:38,563
Skipped town at night?

632
00:53:40,763 --> 00:53:44,573
Of course. The Left State Councillor would not just let a key person go.

633
00:53:46,403 --> 00:53:48,903
Here is the requested autopsy report on the snake hunter murder case.

634
00:53:50,713 --> 00:53:53,512
What is the point of collecting more evidence on Jimjo poison?

635
00:53:53,513 --> 00:53:54,913
We do not have a smoking gun.

636
00:53:56,783 --> 00:53:58,613
But we must do something in the meantime.

637
00:54:18,533 --> 00:54:19,573
What is it?

638
00:54:25,943 --> 00:54:29,183
The location of the swollen red dot on each body...

639
00:54:31,183 --> 00:54:33,353
The Fengfu point. The Philtrum point.

640
00:54:33,823 --> 00:54:34,823
The Tiantu point.

641
00:54:36,023 --> 00:54:37,123
They are all vital points.

642
00:54:38,253 --> 00:54:39,523
If they are red dots,

643
00:54:40,093 --> 00:54:41,993
does that mean acupuncture was performed?

644
00:54:42,423 --> 00:54:43,763
Not by the Chief Court Lady...

645
00:54:44,493 --> 00:54:46,233
but another person in the palace could have.

646
00:54:47,763 --> 00:54:50,403
Someone who can perform acupuncture on vital points.

647
00:54:51,033 --> 00:54:52,033
A female Royal Physician.

648
00:54:52,733 --> 00:54:55,103
Choraengi Mask, who set off the bomb in the Jimjo cave that day,

649
00:54:56,143 --> 00:54:58,373
seemed to know their way around that cave.

650
00:54:59,473 --> 00:55:01,213
That means it was not their first or second time there.

651
00:55:04,713 --> 00:55:07,453
Let us go. I must see for myself.

652
00:55:12,393 --> 00:55:15,863
None of our female Royal Physicians have died recently. Why do you ask?

653
00:55:16,363 --> 00:55:19,133
Have any of the female physicians suddenly disappeared?

654
00:55:22,963 --> 00:55:26,633
Well, one left due to illness a few days ago, but...

655
00:55:27,503 --> 00:55:30,743
You know how the Jimjo appeared in the palace a while ago?

656
00:55:31,043 --> 00:55:32,913
She left the very next day.

657
00:55:33,273 --> 00:55:34,613
Did you see her in person?

658
00:55:35,043 --> 00:55:39,253
She said it was contagious, so she sent someone instead.

659
00:55:45,123 --> 00:55:46,423
Bring me her records.

660
00:55:50,093 --> 00:55:51,193
Drink up.

661
00:55:51,863 --> 00:55:54,263
- Here, drink up.
- So, why are you...

662
00:55:54,503 --> 00:55:58,202
so curious about the owner of that empty house?

663
00:55:58,203 --> 00:55:59,373
You see,

664
00:55:59,773 --> 00:56:02,802
she ran off with my money.

665
00:56:02,803 --> 00:56:04,743
That rotten scoundrel.

666
00:56:06,043 --> 00:56:08,213
Looks like my lord just wasted his money on drinks.

667
00:56:08,813 --> 00:56:11,783
How do you expect to catch a slave who was determined to run away?

668
00:56:12,853 --> 00:56:13,853
A slave?

669
00:56:13,923 --> 00:56:17,523
What? You lent her the money without even knowing that?

670
00:56:17,853 --> 00:56:21,663
If an out-resident slave means to deceive you, you stand no chance.

671
00:56:22,123 --> 00:56:23,123
Just give up.

672
00:56:23,563 --> 00:56:26,533
He is a slave who escaped from the great Left State Councillor himself.

673
00:56:26,833 --> 00:56:28,063
How could you possibly hope to catch them?

674
00:56:28,363 --> 00:56:29,833
Wait, the Left State Councillor?

675
00:56:31,903 --> 00:56:33,273
The owner of that empty house...

676
00:56:33,743 --> 00:56:35,973
is an out-resident slave from the Left State Councillor's household?

677
00:56:37,673 --> 00:56:40,213
Summon the royal guards at once, and send word to Je Un.

678
00:56:40,273 --> 00:56:42,083
We must find the body in the Mount Inwang Cave.

679
00:56:42,143 --> 00:56:44,283
- Yes, Your Highness.
- That might not be necessary.

680
00:56:44,353 --> 00:56:45,353
Gang.

681
00:56:45,783 --> 00:56:47,952
Good. I was about to send for you.

682
00:56:47,953 --> 00:56:49,623
I have identified the Choraengi Mask.

683
00:56:50,453 --> 00:56:52,023
We have to find the body in the cave.

684
00:56:52,353 --> 00:56:53,862
The Choraengi Mask's identity?

685
00:56:53,863 --> 00:56:55,363
But did you not say it was the Chief Court Lady?

686
00:56:55,463 --> 00:56:57,393
She was a Royal Physician named Kim Deok Chun.

687
00:56:58,093 --> 00:57:00,863
Before the Left State Councillor frames the Chief Court Lady's niece,

688
00:57:01,063 --> 00:57:02,333
we have to find her body.

689
00:57:02,403 --> 00:57:05,133
But what is her connection to the Left State Councillor?

690
00:57:05,233 --> 00:57:06,633
I found out the physician's mother...

691
00:57:08,043 --> 00:57:10,103
was an out-resident slave for the Left State Councillor.

692
00:57:11,513 --> 00:57:14,743
Could her name be Yun Gye Sim?

693
00:57:15,643 --> 00:57:16,883
How would you know about that?

694
00:57:17,413 --> 00:57:20,983
She is the one who sold the brewery to the former Chief Court Lady.

695
00:57:43,443 --> 00:57:45,113
- Let us go.
- Yes, Your Highness.

696
00:57:52,953 --> 00:57:55,123
All right. Thank you for your hard work.

697
00:58:03,793 --> 00:58:06,593
The body of the Choraengi Mask must be somewhere here.

698
00:58:07,133 --> 00:58:09,303
- Find the body.
- Yes, Your Highness.

699
00:58:17,243 --> 00:58:18,913
They are the Royal Concubine's neighbours from Boryeong.

700
00:58:22,543 --> 00:58:23,913
Prepare my official robes.

701
00:58:24,813 --> 00:58:26,053
I must go to the palace.

702
00:58:27,423 --> 00:58:30,693
It seems His Royal Highness has, for quite some time,

703
00:58:30,823 --> 00:58:32,923
been consumed by revenge.

704
00:58:34,663 --> 00:58:37,093
He was digging into the Gyesa Year Incident.

705
00:58:37,963 --> 00:58:40,463
I intend to ensure this ends with the Chief Court Lady,

706
00:58:40,833 --> 00:58:43,163
but thanks to His Royal Highness escalating the matter,

707
00:58:44,773 --> 00:58:48,973
it seems we will need another offering.

708
00:58:50,043 --> 00:58:51,173
An offering?

709
00:58:52,543 --> 00:58:53,743
The Royal Concubine...

710
00:58:54,343 --> 00:58:55,413
The Royal Concubine?

711
00:58:55,583 --> 00:59:00,653
Many people witnessed her using the Jimjo chick to lure its mother.

712
00:59:15,703 --> 00:59:17,233
How could you try to take everything...

713
00:59:18,573 --> 00:59:20,373
from the Crown Prince?

714
00:59:24,013 --> 00:59:25,073
Your Majesty.

715
00:59:25,243 --> 00:59:28,243
Is it not a stretch to say the Royal Concubine masterminded the omen?

716
00:59:29,343 --> 00:59:31,283
She would have no motive to do such a thing.

717
00:59:36,353 --> 00:59:39,693
The Royal Concubine has no motive,

718
00:59:42,693 --> 00:59:46,893
but the deposed Crown Princess certainly does.

719
00:59:54,443 --> 00:59:56,802
Do you know how the Royal Concubine...

720
00:59:56,803 --> 00:59:58,673
won the Queen Dowager's favour?

721
01:00:01,743 --> 01:00:04,013
I have heard rumours she resembles the deposed Crown Princess,

722
01:00:04,813 --> 01:00:07,453
but who would believe such a tale?

723
01:00:09,283 --> 01:00:10,523
Do not worry.

724
01:00:11,293 --> 01:00:15,763
I have paid witnesses who will claim she is the deposed Crown Princess.

725
01:00:34,613 --> 01:00:36,843
What have you been so lost in thought about?

726
01:00:43,523 --> 01:00:44,523
Yeon Sim.

727
01:00:45,693 --> 01:00:49,763
About the late Queen. The Crown Prince's mother.

728
01:00:50,993 --> 01:00:55,263
Did she die from drinking poisoned tea?

729
01:00:56,363 --> 01:00:57,373
Yes.

730
01:00:59,033 --> 01:01:01,573
They say that is why the Crown Princess was deposed.

731
01:01:01,943 --> 01:01:03,503
For poisoning the Queen.

732
01:01:04,173 --> 01:01:05,343
The Crown Princess?

733
01:01:06,273 --> 01:01:07,313
Royal Mother.

734
01:01:08,843 --> 01:01:10,113
Royal Mother.

735
01:01:11,883 --> 01:01:12,983
What was the evidence?

736
01:01:13,113 --> 01:01:17,223
They said poison was found somewhere in her quarters.

737
01:01:18,093 --> 01:01:21,323
Was it her drawer? Or her bedding?

738
01:01:22,023 --> 01:01:23,023
A pillow?

739
01:01:23,593 --> 01:01:26,233
Yes. That is right. It was inside her pillow.

740
01:01:27,863 --> 01:01:29,763
Why ask if you already know everything?

741
01:01:34,243 --> 01:01:36,602
- You are right.
- Royal Concubine,

742
01:01:36,603 --> 01:01:38,173
come forth and receive the Royal Order!

743
01:01:38,943 --> 01:01:41,113
Why on earth are you taking her to the Royal Investigation Office?

744
01:01:41,343 --> 01:01:44,813
Testimony says she is the mastermind of the Jimjo incident.

745
01:01:45,013 --> 01:01:47,553
- That is completely absurd!
- It is a Royal Order.

746
01:01:47,923 --> 01:01:49,583
You must come with us.

747
01:01:51,253 --> 01:01:52,253
Your Highness.

748
01:01:54,963 --> 01:01:56,063
Go tell the Crown Prince.

749
01:01:57,663 --> 01:01:58,663
Hurry.

750
01:02:11,373 --> 01:02:12,373
Your Royal Highness.

751
01:02:13,113 --> 01:02:15,843
Well, did you find anything?

752
01:02:16,183 --> 01:02:18,183
We have searched everywhere, but there is no body.

753
01:02:18,253 --> 01:02:21,883
Could she have been fast enough to escape through the entrance?

754
01:02:21,953 --> 01:02:24,723
The bomb went off while she was still inside the cave.

755
01:02:24,993 --> 01:02:28,193
No matter how fast they are, at most they have gone is around 3m.

756
01:02:29,393 --> 01:02:33,293
Then what? Did she grow wings? Or disappear into the earth?

757
01:02:33,893 --> 01:02:34,903
Gosh.

758
01:02:35,603 --> 01:02:37,103
Around 3m?

759
01:02:44,043 --> 01:02:46,273
There! Get them!

760
01:02:57,453 --> 01:02:58,593
What is it?

761
01:03:01,063 --> 01:03:03,893
If she did not fly up to the sky or disappear into the ground,

762
01:03:04,993 --> 01:03:06,133
she must have escaped.

763
01:03:07,033 --> 01:03:08,703
There must be a hidden passage.

764
01:03:09,233 --> 01:03:10,633
Find that passage.

765
01:03:15,703 --> 01:03:16,773
My lady!

766
01:03:17,813 --> 01:03:20,543
- Where is His Royal Highness now?
- I do not know either.

767
01:03:20,883 --> 01:03:22,613
For this to happen to the Royal Concubine, of all times...

768
01:05:02,513 --> 01:05:06,183
I knew it. The Choraengi Mask is alive.

769
01:05:15,863 --> 01:05:18,693
It is harder than you would think, choosing where you belong.

770
01:05:20,693 --> 01:05:22,633
The Crown Prince is looking for your mother.

771
01:05:23,363 --> 01:05:25,673
It is only a matter of time before they find out who you are.

772
01:05:28,173 --> 01:05:29,203
You must leave.

773
01:05:30,603 --> 01:05:32,173
Do not worry about your mother.

774
01:05:46,623 --> 01:05:50,163
It seems this is the first time you are seeing her, Your Majesty.

775
01:05:50,593 --> 01:05:52,932
She resembles the deposed Crown Princess,

776
01:05:52,933 --> 01:05:55,263
but this is the Royal Concubine, Park Dal.

777
01:05:57,773 --> 01:06:00,333
The niece of the former Chief Court Lady Jo...

778
01:06:02,243 --> 01:06:04,843
has identified you as the mastermind behind the Jimjo incident.

779
01:06:06,843 --> 01:06:09,183
- Will you confess?
- Your Majesty.

780
01:06:10,013 --> 01:06:13,283
How could I be the mastermind of the Jimjo incident?

781
01:06:14,213 --> 01:06:16,383
I have no reason to do such a thing.

782
01:06:17,353 --> 01:06:21,223
She said she had to avenge what happened five years ago...

783
01:06:23,393 --> 01:06:26,863
- and to free the Jimjo Birds.
- What in the world?

784
01:06:27,903 --> 01:06:30,303
I truly do not understand why you are doing this to me.

785
01:06:31,433 --> 01:06:34,943
Your Majesty, I was not in the palace five years ago.

786
01:06:35,043 --> 01:06:37,913
So what could I be avenging?

787
01:06:38,343 --> 01:06:39,573
That is because the Royal Concubine...

788
01:06:41,283 --> 01:06:42,643
is the supposedly deceased...

789
01:06:50,083 --> 01:06:51,593
Crown Princess Gang.

790
01:06:53,593 --> 01:06:56,223
I am... Who?

791
01:07:12,443 --> 01:07:13,473
Search every inch of this place.

792
01:07:28,093 --> 01:07:29,093
Your Majesty.

793
01:07:29,723 --> 01:07:31,533
There is another witness.

794
01:07:35,733 --> 01:07:37,873
You two? How are you here?

795
01:07:38,133 --> 01:07:42,343
Your Majesty, Park Dal is not Lord Hong's wife's niece.

796
01:07:43,073 --> 01:07:45,172
Five years ago in winter,

797
01:07:45,173 --> 01:07:48,113
a family from Hanyang arrived suddenly.

798
01:07:48,913 --> 01:07:50,513
Five years ago? What are you talking about?

799
01:07:50,983 --> 01:07:53,252
Why are you lying too?

800
01:07:53,253 --> 01:07:55,523
I have lived in Boryeong since age five!

801
01:07:55,723 --> 01:07:58,723
If you want to know about the lies, go ask your parents.

802
01:07:59,123 --> 01:08:00,993
I am seriously going to lose my mind.

803
01:08:02,363 --> 01:08:04,123
She has the same face as the deposed Crown Princess.

804
01:08:04,463 --> 01:08:06,163
The winter the deposed Crown Princess vanished...

805
01:08:06,633 --> 01:08:08,803
is when she suddenly appeared in Boryeong.

806
01:08:10,903 --> 01:08:13,703
Do you truly believe that is a coincidence?

807
01:08:15,803 --> 01:08:16,803
Your Majesty.

808
01:08:17,443 --> 01:08:19,643
Please deliver your verdict.

809
01:08:27,153 --> 01:08:28,283
Your Majesty.

810
01:08:33,153 --> 01:08:35,463
If the Royal Concubine is the Deposed Crown Princess Gang,

811
01:08:37,263 --> 01:08:39,933
then she is a traitor who fled, defying a Royal Order.

812
01:08:41,663 --> 01:08:43,233
The rightful punishment is beheading.

813
01:08:46,503 --> 01:08:47,733
Proceed with the interrogation.

814
01:08:48,503 --> 01:08:49,703
- Yes, Your Majesty.
- Yes, Your Majesty.

815
01:09:08,293 --> 01:09:11,633
So, where are we? It looks like some kind of house.

816
01:09:52,203 --> 01:09:55,043
If I prove the Jimjo's habitat is linked to the Left State Councillor,

817
01:09:55,573 --> 01:09:57,103
he will be finished for treason.

818
01:10:15,623 --> 01:10:18,393
- Gang, this place is...
- Yes.

819
01:10:19,533 --> 01:10:22,163
Yes. We have finally found it.

820
01:10:26,803 --> 01:10:27,803
Your Majesty.

821
01:10:32,873 --> 01:10:34,583
Her feet are smooth, without a single callus.

822
01:10:35,243 --> 01:10:37,113
Those are not the feet of someone who has walked mountain trails.

823
01:10:38,183 --> 01:10:39,983
There was another Choraengi Mask.

824
01:10:40,383 --> 01:10:42,623
He must have known the layout of the Mount Inwang Cave...

825
01:10:42,723 --> 01:10:46,193
because he evaded a dozen men and blew himself up inside.

826
01:10:47,123 --> 01:10:48,793
Not only was he not wearing a Choraengi Mask,

827
01:10:49,393 --> 01:10:51,463
but she has never even been to the Mount Inwang Cave.

828
01:10:51,733 --> 01:10:52,733
Let go of me.

829
01:10:53,433 --> 01:10:54,463
Let go!

830
01:10:55,563 --> 01:10:56,563
Hey, you.

831
01:10:56,933 --> 01:11:00,273
I am asking what you have against me to treat me like this.

832
01:11:01,033 --> 01:11:02,473
Are you accusing me of ordering you...

833
01:11:03,103 --> 01:11:05,773
to raise Jimjo Birds in the cave beside the smithy...

834
01:11:05,913 --> 01:11:08,043
in the village at the foot of Mount Bukak?

835
01:11:09,013 --> 01:11:10,013
Yes.

836
01:11:10,313 --> 01:11:12,013
You explicitly told me to raise the Jimjo Birds...

837
01:11:12,383 --> 01:11:14,213
in the cave beside the smithy...

838
01:11:14,823 --> 01:11:17,283
in the village at the foot of Mount Bukak.

839
01:11:18,023 --> 01:11:19,093
You clearly said...

840
01:11:19,423 --> 01:11:20,753
it was in the cave beside the smithy...

841
01:11:20,893 --> 01:11:22,363
in the village at the foot of Mount Bukak.

842
01:11:23,023 --> 01:11:24,463
Is that what you said?

843
01:11:26,833 --> 01:11:31,973
I thought I heard it was a cave by the brewery below Mount Inwang.

844
01:11:32,673 --> 01:11:35,573
- That is what I heard as well.
- Really?

845
01:11:37,803 --> 01:11:41,813
Did everyone see that? This woman is lying.

846
01:11:42,283 --> 01:11:44,653
The story about raising Jimjo Birds is a complete lie,

847
01:11:44,713 --> 01:11:47,183
so how can you believe her? Am I wrong?

848
01:11:58,493 --> 01:12:00,563
It is too late. We will stop for today.

849
01:12:02,063 --> 01:12:04,673
The interrogation will resume at first light.

850
01:12:05,003 --> 01:12:06,033
- Yes, Your Majesty!
- Yes, Your Majesty!

851
01:12:06,333 --> 01:12:08,843
His Royal Highness, the Crown Prince, has arrived!

852
01:12:42,773 --> 01:12:43,773
Your Majesty.

853
01:12:44,243 --> 01:12:46,513
If you are here for the Royal Concubine, you have come in vain.

854
01:12:47,573 --> 01:12:49,143
The interrogation is over for today.

855
01:12:49,443 --> 01:12:53,253
I am not here for her. I am here for the Left State Councillor.

856
01:12:54,083 --> 01:12:55,223
What are you...

857
01:12:55,983 --> 01:13:00,153
Left State Councillor Kim Han Chul is behind the Jimjo incident.

858
01:13:07,163 --> 01:13:08,363
Do you have proof?

859
01:13:09,163 --> 01:13:10,462
I found a secret passage that connects...

860
01:13:10,463 --> 01:13:11,733
the Mount Inwang Cave...

861
01:13:12,133 --> 01:13:13,703
to the Left State Councillor's home.

862
01:13:22,743 --> 01:13:24,043
Well, now.

863
01:13:24,753 --> 01:13:28,453
Are you all as shocked as I am? Because I am utterly shocked.

864
01:13:28,783 --> 01:13:30,753
You see, I simply...

865
01:13:31,623 --> 01:13:35,323
followed a tunnel leading from the Jimjo cave,

866
01:13:36,063 --> 01:13:38,663
and what do you know? It led to the Left State Councillor's!

867
01:13:39,533 --> 01:13:40,563
Goodness.

868
01:13:44,603 --> 01:13:45,973
What are you staring at?

869
01:13:46,433 --> 01:13:49,943
Hey, you punk! Lower your eyes!

870
01:13:50,003 --> 01:13:51,873
You do not seem to get what is happening.

871
01:13:51,943 --> 01:13:54,342
Your master is no longer the Left State Councillor.

872
01:13:54,343 --> 01:13:55,412
He is now a traitor.

873
01:13:55,413 --> 01:13:56,483
And I should gouge your eyes out.

874
01:13:57,383 --> 01:13:59,353
- Prince Lee Un, where are you?
- You had better...

875
01:14:22,703 --> 01:14:23,743
You pulled it off.

876
01:14:24,103 --> 01:14:25,143
Of course I did.

877
01:14:26,773 --> 01:14:27,943
I am just that good.

878
01:15:11,553 --> 01:15:12,553
The Crown Prince's Concubine.

879
01:15:14,823 --> 01:15:15,823
No.

880
01:15:17,593 --> 01:15:19,063
Kill the Crown Princess.

881
01:15:20,333 --> 01:15:24,033
(Moon River)

882
01:15:39,083 --> 01:15:41,082
The day your father is arrested,

883
01:15:41,083 --> 01:15:43,053
pack light and meet me at the greenhouse.

884
01:15:43,253 --> 01:15:44,783
We are going to run away together.

885
01:15:44,853 --> 01:15:48,093
Why do I keep having this dream? What is this memory?

886
01:15:48,153 --> 01:15:49,993
How nice.

887
01:15:50,163 --> 01:15:53,393
I will expose the Left State Councillor's crimes one by one.

888
01:15:53,463 --> 01:15:55,603
Arrest the family of the Crown Prince's Concubine.

889
01:15:55,733 --> 01:15:57,763
Going after their family is a low blow, is it not?
