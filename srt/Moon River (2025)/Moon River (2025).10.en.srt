1
00:00:09,111 --> 00:00:10,441
(All people, incidents, and backgrounds...)

2
00:00:10,511 --> 00:00:11,741
(in this drama are fictitious and unrelated to reality.)

3
00:00:11,811 --> 00:00:13,081
(Also, children and animals were filmed under production guidelines.)

4
00:00:31,331 --> 00:00:32,331
You have done well.

5
00:00:34,501 --> 00:00:37,341
At dawn, I will interrogate the Left State Councillor myself.

6
00:00:38,801 --> 00:00:40,101
So you should return to the palace as well.

7
00:00:40,611 --> 00:00:41,941
As you command, Your Majesty.

8
00:00:42,411 --> 00:00:44,111
The Royal Concubine must have been very frightened.

9
00:00:44,781 --> 00:00:46,081
No, I am all right.

10
00:00:55,191 --> 00:00:57,991
Your Royal Highness, why the long face?

11
00:00:58,721 --> 00:00:59,861
It is all over now,

12
00:01:00,121 --> 00:01:02,961
but I am worried that you still seem so upset.

13
00:01:04,961 --> 00:01:07,161
His Majesty must have mixed feelings as well.

14
00:01:07,801 --> 00:01:10,641
After all, he lost my mother because of the Left State Councillor.

15
00:01:13,701 --> 00:01:14,711
Royal Mother

16
00:01:15,671 --> 00:01:16,671
Royal Mother

17
00:01:22,651 --> 00:01:23,651
Your Highness.

18
00:01:24,881 --> 00:01:28,851
- I have been having these dreams.
- Your Highness.

19
00:01:29,621 --> 00:01:30,691
What are your orders regarding this woman?

20
00:01:37,261 --> 00:01:40,031
You must leave before my father has you killed.

21
00:01:42,231 --> 00:01:43,701
Do not worry about your mother.

22
00:01:44,601 --> 00:01:45,601
Just save yourself.

23
00:01:45,941 --> 00:01:48,771
My mother's life is in the Left State Councillor's hands,

24
00:01:49,311 --> 00:01:50,441
so I am not going anywhere.

25
00:01:56,951 --> 00:01:57,951
I am sorry.

26
00:01:59,421 --> 00:02:01,091
I apologise on my father's behalf.

27
00:02:01,891 --> 00:02:03,191
There is no need for that.

28
00:02:11,331 --> 00:02:13,431
- Not that pot. The other one.
- Right.

29
00:02:18,271 --> 00:02:19,441
The Left State Councillor is jailed,

30
00:02:19,471 --> 00:02:20,871
and the Royal Investigation Office will investigate him.

31
00:02:23,211 --> 00:02:25,611
What has you so deep in thought?

32
00:02:26,181 --> 00:02:28,451
I wonder what started this tragedy.

33
00:02:29,051 --> 00:02:33,151
What drove the Left State Councillor to be so relentlessly evil?

34
00:02:34,451 --> 00:02:35,451
I am just curious.

35
00:02:36,221 --> 00:02:37,621
You know the saying.

36
00:02:37,991 --> 00:02:40,561
Good people cannot fathom true evil,

37
00:02:40,661 --> 00:02:43,261
and evil people cannot fathom true goodness.

38
00:02:43,591 --> 00:02:46,531
There is a four-character idiom for it. "Good, evil..."

39
00:02:47,631 --> 00:02:51,341
My lord, you will never understand a man like him, not ever.

40
00:02:52,001 --> 00:02:53,471
We should get going. We are running out of time.

41
00:02:58,981 --> 00:02:59,981
Let us go.

42
00:03:01,211 --> 00:03:02,211
Get this out of the way.

43
00:03:28,371 --> 00:03:29,371
The Crown Prince's Concubine.

44
00:03:31,641 --> 00:03:32,641
No.

45
00:03:34,381 --> 00:03:35,851
Kill the Crown Princess.

46
00:03:37,721 --> 00:03:41,521
(Chapter 10: The Calm Before the Storm)

47
00:04:11,651 --> 00:04:13,451
The Left State Councillor has been arrested.

48
00:04:13,781 --> 00:04:16,021
I will take our men to the Royal Investigation Office.

49
00:04:16,421 --> 00:04:18,921
- We have no orders from him.
- But...

50
00:04:21,491 --> 00:04:24,331
We have no orders from him.

51
00:04:26,001 --> 00:04:28,871
Have you forgotten that we only act on his orders?

52
00:04:29,571 --> 00:04:30,571
My apologies.

53
00:04:31,801 --> 00:04:34,211
Leave me. I am busy.

54
00:04:44,481 --> 00:04:46,381
Do you think you can just borrow money and not pay it back?

55
00:04:47,181 --> 00:04:50,251
Even Buddha has no mercy for wicked men like you.

56
00:04:50,491 --> 00:04:53,191
But I already paid back the principal!

57
00:04:53,661 --> 00:04:55,031
You only paid back the principal.

58
00:04:55,461 --> 00:04:58,461
- Who is going to pay the interest?
- Darn it!

59
00:04:58,801 --> 00:05:01,601
Just kill me, you thief!

60
00:05:04,701 --> 00:05:06,301
People have this misconception.

61
00:05:06,841 --> 00:05:10,411
They think since life is precious, it must be valuable.

62
00:05:11,141 --> 00:05:14,711
- You lot will never earn a dime.
- You...

63
00:05:15,851 --> 00:05:18,321
Sell the older one as a slave and the younger one as a eunuch.

64
00:05:18,381 --> 00:05:21,291
No! You cannot, you jerk! No!

65
00:05:24,491 --> 00:05:27,061
Your Highness, there is terrible news.

66
00:05:27,261 --> 00:05:28,690
The Left State Councillor...

67
00:05:28,691 --> 00:05:30,800
has been jailed at the Royal Investigation Office.

68
00:05:30,801 --> 00:05:31,801
My father?

69
00:05:32,031 --> 00:05:35,331
Evidence was found at his residence, proving he is the Jimjo's master.

70
00:05:35,871 --> 00:05:37,841
Since the Jimjo attacked the palace, this is...

71
00:05:38,441 --> 00:05:39,441
considered an act of treason.

72
00:05:41,771 --> 00:05:42,771
What should we do, Your Highness?

73
00:05:43,111 --> 00:05:45,381
- If it is treason...
- Then Your Highness could also...

74
00:05:45,881 --> 00:05:48,811
be placed in confinement or even arrested.

75
00:05:58,861 --> 00:06:00,221
I have to go to the Royal Investigation Office.

76
00:06:00,861 --> 00:06:05,401
- I need to see my father in person.
- Yes. I will handle it discreetly.

77
00:06:19,081 --> 00:06:22,011
Your Highness. This is not the way to the Royal Investigation Office.

78
00:06:24,851 --> 00:06:27,891
I think there is a pebble in my shoe. With my position,

79
00:06:28,221 --> 00:06:30,521
I cannot very well take it out in the middle of the road.

80
00:06:30,991 --> 00:06:31,991
Of course, Your Highness.

81
00:06:49,341 --> 00:06:50,341
Yeo Ri.

82
00:06:50,911 --> 00:06:51,911
Yes, Your Highness?

83
00:06:52,811 --> 00:06:53,811
What are you doing?

84
00:06:54,081 --> 00:06:57,181
- Let go of me! Goodness.
- Please hold still.

85
00:06:57,251 --> 00:06:58,251
Your Highness!

86
00:07:11,231 --> 00:07:13,461
The patrol will be here soon, so just stay put for a moment.

87
00:07:14,601 --> 00:07:15,931
I am so sorry, my lady.

88
00:07:17,601 --> 00:07:18,601
I am sorry as well.

89
00:07:28,081 --> 00:07:29,611
The day your father is arrested,

90
00:07:29,951 --> 00:07:32,251
pack light and meet me at the greenhouse.

91
00:07:32,751 --> 00:07:35,591
That day, we are going to run away together.

92
00:08:13,261 --> 00:08:14,261
U Hui.

93
00:08:17,131 --> 00:08:18,131
You have been through so much.

94
00:08:22,701 --> 00:08:24,171
- Here...
- Go ahead.

95
00:08:24,801 --> 00:08:25,801
Hurry.

96
00:08:26,371 --> 00:08:28,971
You two can catch up later,

97
00:08:29,341 --> 00:08:30,341
but change into your disguises first.

98
00:08:30,741 --> 00:08:31,741
Right.

99
00:08:43,091 --> 00:08:44,091
Well...

100
00:08:44,521 --> 00:08:46,421
Yeo Ri, are you finished changing yet?

101
00:08:46,761 --> 00:08:49,161
We are. He is certainly in a hurry.

102
00:09:51,091 --> 00:09:54,431
You seem upset you will not be able to visit the greenhouse anymore.

103
00:09:55,191 --> 00:09:59,501
After all, you always did love this greenhouse.

104
00:10:00,331 --> 00:10:01,671
It was you I loved.

105
00:10:13,411 --> 00:10:14,411
Gosh.

106
00:10:14,781 --> 00:10:18,221
You can do that later. Let us go. We have a long journey ahead.

107
00:10:19,551 --> 00:10:20,551
Let us go.

108
00:10:30,331 --> 00:10:32,161
Who forced you to a false confession?

109
00:10:32,531 --> 00:10:34,701
Grant my request, and I will tell you.

110
00:10:35,431 --> 00:10:36,801
I will even testify.

111
00:10:37,841 --> 00:10:40,100
Your lie almost killed the Royal Concubine,

112
00:10:40,101 --> 00:10:41,111
and you dare to make demands?

113
00:10:41,341 --> 00:10:42,371
How dare you?

114
00:10:47,381 --> 00:10:49,381
First off, what is your request?

115
00:10:49,751 --> 00:10:52,551
If you promise to spare the life of the former Chief Royal Secretary,

116
00:10:52,981 --> 00:10:56,391
I will tell you everything. Please save the Chief Royal Secretary.

117
00:10:56,591 --> 00:10:57,791
The former Chief Royal Secretary?

118
00:10:58,091 --> 00:11:00,021
You mean Han Seok Won, who was sent into exile?

119
00:11:01,231 --> 00:11:02,231
Do not tell me...

120
00:11:02,731 --> 00:11:03,831
You and that official...

121
00:11:05,631 --> 00:11:06,861
are lovers?

122
00:11:10,731 --> 00:11:12,201
If that is your concern, do not worry.

123
00:11:12,571 --> 00:11:14,571
The Left State Councillor is arrested at the Royal Investigation Office.

124
00:11:14,641 --> 00:11:16,071
You think the Left State Councillor would do it himself?

125
00:11:16,671 --> 00:11:18,040
His underlings have their orders.

126
00:11:18,041 --> 00:11:19,411
They will be the ones to kill the Chief Royal Secretary.

127
00:11:32,521 --> 00:11:33,561
What are you going to do?

128
00:11:34,061 --> 00:11:35,531
She is a criminal who endangered you.

129
00:11:35,991 --> 00:11:37,461
Why should I grant her wish?

130
00:11:38,661 --> 00:11:40,601
But she only did it to save her lover.

131
00:11:40,701 --> 00:11:43,671
If her own lover is so precious, she should know others' are too.

132
00:11:46,371 --> 00:11:48,671
I am so furious at the Left State Councillor's actions.

133
00:11:49,511 --> 00:11:52,181
The Left State Councillor acts as if he is the Almighty...

134
00:11:52,541 --> 00:11:53,781
or the Buddha,

135
00:11:54,411 --> 00:11:56,411
preying on people's weaknesses and toying with their feelings this way.

136
00:11:57,411 --> 00:11:59,681
How can anyone think straight when they are in his palm?

137
00:12:08,731 --> 00:12:11,201
Are you really just going to let this happen?

138
00:12:17,371 --> 00:12:19,441
You always find a way to make me feel ashamed of myself.

139
00:12:23,411 --> 00:12:26,041
Send former Secretary Han Seok Won to the Royal Investigation Office...

140
00:12:26,081 --> 00:12:27,281
and guard him closely.

141
00:12:27,641 --> 00:12:30,380
Announce the reopening of the Sinjusa case as well.

142
00:12:30,381 --> 00:12:31,481
Yes, Your Highness.

143
00:12:36,291 --> 00:12:37,291
Oh, my.

144
00:12:37,821 --> 00:12:38,821
Right now?

145
00:12:44,191 --> 00:12:45,361
I guess I am just hungry.

146
00:12:46,631 --> 00:12:48,271
You are hungry?

147
00:12:49,131 --> 00:12:50,501
You should go get something to eat...

148
00:12:51,571 --> 00:12:52,571
Wait a minute.

149
00:12:53,541 --> 00:12:54,841
They have not fed you yet?

150
00:12:55,811 --> 00:12:58,411
- Why those jerks...
- I did eat, but...

151
00:12:58,481 --> 00:13:00,181
Your Highness, you did not feed us either.

152
00:13:00,741 --> 00:13:02,811
We were in no condition to eat, were we?

153
00:13:03,111 --> 00:13:05,051
The situation was extremely unusual and urgent.

154
00:13:05,481 --> 00:13:07,550
- Is that not right?
- I am fine, Your Highness.

155
00:13:07,551 --> 00:13:10,051
I am used to such harsh treatment.

156
00:13:12,161 --> 00:13:14,931
Honestly. Why would you do that?

157
00:13:15,661 --> 00:13:19,801
Generosity comes from great wealth, loyalty from a full stomach. Right?

158
00:13:20,501 --> 00:13:24,331
This will not do. I will treat you to great rice soup,

159
00:13:24,641 --> 00:13:26,201
so my two loyal subjects, follow me.

160
00:13:28,541 --> 00:13:30,041
Rice soup sounds delicious.

161
00:13:35,511 --> 00:13:37,151
Hey, buy me some too!

162
00:13:39,151 --> 00:13:40,151
I am hungry too.

163
00:13:41,691 --> 00:13:42,691
What?

164
00:13:44,691 --> 00:13:46,790
Grand Prince Je Un and the Crown Princess Consort left?

165
00:13:46,791 --> 00:13:47,861
All of a sudden?

166
00:13:49,131 --> 00:13:50,991
It all happened so suddenly.

167
00:13:51,561 --> 00:13:53,431
They did not even get to say goodbye to me.

168
00:13:54,201 --> 00:13:55,201
Gang.

169
00:13:57,501 --> 00:14:00,201
I will leave right after the Left State Councillor's arrest.

170
00:14:00,401 --> 00:14:02,141
What? Why so suddenly?

171
00:14:02,471 --> 00:14:03,771
Surely, you understand.

172
00:14:04,141 --> 00:14:05,741
If the Left State Councillor is arrested for treason,

173
00:14:06,141 --> 00:14:08,981
U Hui will be arrested as well. There is no time.

174
00:14:12,051 --> 00:14:15,491
Where will you go? Do you even have a plan?

175
00:14:16,221 --> 00:14:18,361
Yes, I plan to go to Qing.

176
00:14:18,921 --> 00:14:21,991
I heard a merchant ship is leaving for Qing from Jemulpo tomorrow.

177
00:14:23,361 --> 00:14:26,701
But still, how could he leave without a word?

178
00:14:27,831 --> 00:14:28,831
Gosh.

179
00:14:29,731 --> 00:14:30,731
What is this?

180
00:14:31,601 --> 00:14:32,641
Are you seriously putting down your spoon...

181
00:14:33,001 --> 00:14:35,141
in front of me because another man left?

182
00:14:35,511 --> 00:14:37,441
After all the time we spent together,

183
00:14:37,741 --> 00:14:39,341
he left without a word.

184
00:14:40,081 --> 00:14:42,751
I just feel so empty inside. I have lost my appetite.

185
00:14:42,851 --> 00:14:46,181
Please. Just how close did you two get?

186
00:14:47,021 --> 00:14:48,851
Hey, pick up your spoon now.

187
00:14:50,421 --> 00:14:51,491
She finished the whole bowl.

188
00:14:51,791 --> 00:14:53,221
Yes, she scraped the bowl clean.

189
00:14:56,691 --> 00:14:57,691
I thought you lost your appetite.

190
00:14:59,201 --> 00:15:00,201
Oh, gosh.

191
00:15:42,271 --> 00:15:46,241
(Royal Investigation Office)

192
00:15:58,591 --> 00:15:59,661
Left State Councillor!

193
00:16:02,391 --> 00:16:05,561
What brings you here at this hour?

194
00:16:05,901 --> 00:16:08,501
I deserve to die. The Crown Princess Consort...

195
00:16:10,101 --> 00:16:11,571
has fled.

196
00:16:15,911 --> 00:16:17,871
Send out my men and find U Hui.

197
00:16:18,481 --> 00:16:20,941
Distribute her sketch to all the taverns and inns.

198
00:16:21,681 --> 00:16:24,821
Block all roads leading to the ports and the border.

199
00:16:25,981 --> 00:16:26,981
Under no circumstances...

200
00:16:27,521 --> 00:16:29,351
is anyone else to find out.

201
00:16:29,791 --> 00:16:30,791
Yes, my lord.

202
00:16:57,381 --> 00:16:58,381
Gosh!

203
00:16:59,751 --> 00:17:01,181
I am so exhausted. I cannot go on.

204
00:17:01,281 --> 00:17:03,451
Yeo Ri, one might think you are the young lady.

205
00:17:03,821 --> 00:17:06,491
How are you more exhausted than the Left State Councillor's daughter?

206
00:17:06,561 --> 00:17:08,831
What, were you raised like a princess?

207
00:17:09,331 --> 00:17:10,531
Actually,

208
00:17:10,891 --> 00:17:15,131
it is better to serve a rich family. I have never really had it rough.

209
00:17:15,571 --> 00:17:18,341
I served the Left State Councillor, and then I became a court lady.

210
00:17:18,371 --> 00:17:19,971
So what kind of hardship could I have possibly known?

211
00:17:20,041 --> 00:17:22,741
For crying out loud. You would think my lord was...

212
00:17:23,011 --> 00:17:26,711
just some low-ranking official. My lord is royalty!

213
00:17:26,781 --> 00:17:28,141
He is a Grand Prince!

214
00:17:28,411 --> 00:17:29,451
Exactly.

215
00:17:29,851 --> 00:17:31,211
Grand Prince Je Un and his precious lady...

216
00:17:31,621 --> 00:17:34,951
hit it off, and now we are the ones suffering for it, are we not?

217
00:17:35,221 --> 00:17:38,461
For someone so tired, you sure have a loud mouth, Yeo Ri.

218
00:17:38,561 --> 00:17:39,561
Am I wrong?

219
00:17:40,191 --> 00:17:43,191
Well, it is getting too late,

220
00:17:44,091 --> 00:17:46,631
so let us stay at that inn.

221
00:17:46,701 --> 00:17:47,860
- Yes, my lord.
- Yes.

222
00:17:47,861 --> 00:17:49,201
Please be careful.

223
00:17:49,731 --> 00:17:50,871
Watch your step.

224
00:17:51,641 --> 00:17:53,201
- Let me carry your...
- No!

225
00:17:53,771 --> 00:17:55,711
Just come on! Darn it.

226
00:17:55,771 --> 00:17:58,711
Unbelievable. Such a young thing, talking back so defiantly.

227
00:18:31,611 --> 00:18:32,611
U Hui.

228
00:18:37,251 --> 00:18:38,921
U Hui, are you asleep?

229
00:18:41,551 --> 00:18:42,591
U Hui.

230
00:18:47,921 --> 00:18:48,991
Are you all right?

231
00:18:51,431 --> 00:18:52,461
Wait a minute.

232
00:18:53,501 --> 00:18:54,831
Are you laughing right now?

233
00:18:56,771 --> 00:18:57,771
What a relief.

234
00:18:58,231 --> 00:19:00,741
The pain tells me this is not a dream.

235
00:19:05,611 --> 00:19:08,381
- What is this?
- What?

236
00:19:09,781 --> 00:19:10,911
There is nothing there.

237
00:19:23,661 --> 00:19:25,901
Why do you have soot all over your face?

238
00:19:26,701 --> 00:19:27,701
Oh, right.

239
00:19:28,101 --> 00:19:30,831
I must have gotten it on my face while boiling water earlier.

240
00:19:33,571 --> 00:19:37,270
You boiled the water yourself?

241
00:19:37,271 --> 00:19:38,271
Yes.

242
00:19:39,011 --> 00:19:40,311
The innkeeper seemed to be asleep.

243
00:19:40,611 --> 00:19:42,711
Please. I will do that.

244
00:19:43,911 --> 00:19:44,911
I do not want you to.

245
00:19:51,691 --> 00:19:55,391
But why the sudden hot compress?

246
00:20:02,971 --> 00:20:04,131
Because you were limping.

247
00:20:07,701 --> 00:20:08,771
You noticed?

248
00:20:10,241 --> 00:20:11,941
I tried so hard to hide it.

249
00:20:12,881 --> 00:20:14,081
Do not hide things from me.

250
00:20:14,941 --> 00:20:16,481
When you suffer in silence,

251
00:20:18,181 --> 00:20:19,181
that is what hurts me the most.

252
00:20:20,281 --> 00:20:23,721
I told you, did I not? I would be your brother, your friend,

253
00:20:24,251 --> 00:20:26,861
your father, and your man.

254
00:20:29,291 --> 00:20:30,661
That is why I am here.

255
00:20:32,331 --> 00:20:33,661
So with me,

256
00:20:34,801 --> 00:20:36,771
if you are angry, you can show it.

257
00:20:37,301 --> 00:20:38,441
If you feel like crying,

258
00:20:40,371 --> 00:20:41,541
you can cry in my arms.

259
00:20:43,771 --> 00:20:44,771
So please,

260
00:20:47,081 --> 00:20:49,211
do not ever hold back again.

261
00:20:55,691 --> 00:20:58,921
I will even heat up the cauldron water for you tomorrow morning.

262
00:21:04,261 --> 00:21:05,261
But...

263
00:21:06,401 --> 00:21:09,431
- you lit a fire in the furnace?
- I did.

264
00:21:09,471 --> 00:21:11,671
- In the middle of summer?
- Yes.

265
00:21:12,601 --> 00:21:13,601
Why?

266
00:21:16,771 --> 00:21:20,841
King Yeomra, it is so hot!

267
00:21:21,711 --> 00:21:23,251
It is so hot.

268
00:21:23,281 --> 00:21:24,411
Goodness.

269
00:21:27,981 --> 00:21:31,491
Gosh! It is way too hot.

270
00:21:32,521 --> 00:21:35,191
I cannot stand the fires of the fiery pit.

271
00:21:41,101 --> 00:21:42,101
Sleep warm.

272
00:21:57,451 --> 00:21:59,121
Please take me to the palace.

273
00:22:00,051 --> 00:22:01,051
Please save me.

274
00:22:23,611 --> 00:22:25,481
Why do I keep having such dreams?

275
00:22:29,451 --> 00:22:31,380
Five years ago in winter,

276
00:22:31,381 --> 00:22:34,451
a family from Hanyang arrived suddenly.

277
00:22:34,751 --> 00:22:36,021
Who are you?

278
00:22:36,651 --> 00:22:37,651
You fell into the water,

279
00:22:38,491 --> 00:22:40,361
and it seems you have lost your memory.

280
00:22:41,391 --> 00:22:43,891
The moment I woke up after losing my memory...

281
00:22:44,961 --> 00:22:46,431
was five winters ago.

282
00:22:52,241 --> 00:22:53,241
Then...

283
00:22:53,971 --> 00:22:55,241
what is this memory?

284
00:23:20,061 --> 00:23:21,061
Well done.

285
00:23:24,201 --> 00:23:26,141
Did you sleep well, my lady?

286
00:23:26,901 --> 00:23:29,171
I dreamed I was a pig sizzling on a cauldron lid.

287
00:23:29,241 --> 00:23:32,141
I am telling you, I thought my back was completely cooked.

288
00:23:32,681 --> 00:23:35,381
I met King Yeomra in the fires of the fiery pit.

289
00:23:35,811 --> 00:23:37,581
My back was killing me, I am serious.

290
00:23:38,311 --> 00:23:40,421
Where is the innkeeper? Innkeeper!

291
00:23:40,751 --> 00:23:44,151
Why are the floors burning hot in the middle of summer?

292
00:23:46,061 --> 00:23:50,291
You will miss Joseon's heated floors once we leave,

293
00:23:50,591 --> 00:23:52,931
so think of this as one last fond memory.

294
00:23:56,671 --> 00:23:57,931
Come on, U Hui. Let us go.

295
00:23:59,671 --> 00:24:01,911
- We should get going.
- But my back is killing me.

296
00:24:01,971 --> 00:24:03,071
Just come on, hurry up.

297
00:24:04,441 --> 00:24:06,210
Now that it has been revealed...

298
00:24:06,211 --> 00:24:07,541
that the Left State Councillor is the master of the Jimjo,

299
00:24:07,781 --> 00:24:09,510
soon he will be exposed as the culprit...

300
00:24:09,511 --> 00:24:10,681
of the Gyesa Year Incident, right?

301
00:24:12,221 --> 00:24:14,181
The bodies of those killed with Jimjo poison...

302
00:24:14,551 --> 00:24:16,851
show the same symptoms as those who died in the Gyesa Year.

303
00:24:17,491 --> 00:24:19,661
It will be easier to get to the bottom of the incident now.

304
00:24:21,191 --> 00:24:22,191
You did well.

305
00:24:22,831 --> 00:24:24,431
You have really been through so much.

306
00:24:25,031 --> 00:24:26,201
This is just the beginning.

307
00:24:27,061 --> 00:24:28,231
Now, I have to expose...

308
00:24:28,931 --> 00:24:30,971
every single evil thing the Left State Councillor has done.

309
00:24:35,341 --> 00:24:36,341
Lift your arms for me.

310
00:24:39,211 --> 00:24:41,281
On a day as important as this,

311
00:24:42,111 --> 00:24:45,081
you must look dignified, Your Royal Highness. All right?

312
00:24:45,481 --> 00:24:48,081
Your attire must be impeccable.

313
00:24:53,321 --> 00:24:54,321
Goodness.

314
00:24:56,331 --> 00:24:59,131
I need strength more than I need dignity.

315
00:24:59,401 --> 00:25:02,431
What is the matter? It is not even time for the Morning Assembly yet.

316
00:25:02,901 --> 00:25:04,401
Let us just stay like this for a moment.

317
00:25:04,671 --> 00:25:05,671
Let me draw some strength from you.

318
00:25:06,071 --> 00:25:07,541
Gosh.

319
00:25:09,211 --> 00:25:11,371
That is nice.

320
00:25:15,381 --> 00:25:18,351
Your Royal Highness, may I enter for a moment?

321
00:25:18,611 --> 00:25:20,421
No, you cannot. Do not come in.

322
00:25:20,681 --> 00:25:23,351
- His Majesty is looking for you.
- What?

323
00:25:24,621 --> 00:25:26,121
What do you mean? It is time for the Morning Assembly.

324
00:25:26,561 --> 00:25:27,561
Right now?

325
00:25:45,011 --> 00:25:46,011
Your Royal Highness.

326
00:25:47,681 --> 00:25:49,751
I trust you had a peaceful night.

327
00:25:52,181 --> 00:25:53,181
No.

328
00:25:55,591 --> 00:25:56,921
Left State Councillor. What are you doing here?

329
00:25:57,491 --> 00:25:58,721
After a misunderstanding was cleared,

330
00:25:59,321 --> 00:26:02,491
His Majesty the King personally granted my release.

331
00:26:02,831 --> 00:26:03,831
That is impossible.

332
00:26:04,861 --> 00:26:06,901
Why would he do such a thing?

333
00:26:07,301 --> 00:26:10,601
You should hear it from His Majesty yourself.

334
00:26:23,511 --> 00:26:25,051
What is the meaning of this?

335
00:26:25,581 --> 00:26:28,281
We have proof that the Left State Councillor is the Jimjo's master.

336
00:26:28,551 --> 00:26:30,651
So how could you possibly set him free?

337
00:26:31,251 --> 00:26:32,321
The Left State Councillor...

338
00:26:34,191 --> 00:26:36,661
possesses a secret pact that I wrote with my own hand.

339
00:26:37,031 --> 00:26:40,061
A secret pact? What kind of pact is it?

340
00:26:40,961 --> 00:26:42,031
In the Gyesa Year,

341
00:26:43,131 --> 00:26:45,101
the Left State Councillor came to see me.

342
00:26:46,401 --> 00:26:48,271
(Gyesa Year)

343
00:26:48,341 --> 00:26:51,271
(After the former king's death)

344
00:26:54,511 --> 00:26:58,651
This poison is colourless, odourless, and tasteless.

345
00:26:59,321 --> 00:27:01,281
It also does not react to silver.

346
00:27:01,781 --> 00:27:02,791
What is more,

347
00:27:03,621 --> 00:27:07,521
the bodies of those killed by it do not decay or turn black,

348
00:27:07,691 --> 00:27:09,191
nor do they bloat.

349
00:27:12,631 --> 00:27:13,731
At most,

350
00:27:15,701 --> 00:27:17,271
they might vomit a little blood.

351
00:27:31,481 --> 00:27:32,481
Then...

352
00:27:33,481 --> 00:27:35,921
is that the poison that assassinated the King and the Firstborn Prince?

353
00:27:37,091 --> 00:27:38,091
Yes.

354
00:27:38,521 --> 00:27:39,621
Have you found the killer?

355
00:27:40,791 --> 00:27:41,791
Who is it?

356
00:27:42,191 --> 00:27:44,831
Who would dare commit such a monstrous crime?

357
00:27:46,061 --> 00:27:47,061
It was me.

358
00:27:49,701 --> 00:27:51,901
What are you saying?

359
00:27:53,641 --> 00:27:55,441
Not just the Late King and the Firstborn Prince,

360
00:27:56,441 --> 00:27:59,911
but the Queen Dowager's two brothers who recently died as well.

361
00:28:01,641 --> 00:28:03,051
I killed them all.

362
00:28:04,311 --> 00:28:06,251
I have already done the dirty work.

363
00:28:06,821 --> 00:28:08,051
So you, Prince Geumseong,

364
00:28:08,781 --> 00:28:11,151
all you have to do is prepare to take the throne.

365
00:28:12,821 --> 00:28:13,821
Are you telling me...

366
00:28:15,121 --> 00:28:17,091
you poisoned my own brother?

367
00:28:21,561 --> 00:28:23,171
I will go to the Royal Investigation Office right now,

368
00:28:23,431 --> 00:28:25,541
and I will expose every one of your wicked crimes.

369
00:28:25,901 --> 00:28:27,441
There is no need for that.

370
00:28:29,171 --> 00:28:32,181
The Royal Investigation Office is already on their way here.

371
00:28:33,611 --> 00:28:35,951
I hid this very poison...

372
00:28:36,751 --> 00:28:38,811
right here in your home.

373
00:28:39,281 --> 00:28:40,351
That pathetic poison...

374
00:28:41,021 --> 00:28:44,251
All I have to do is find it first and tell the Office the truth!

375
00:28:44,451 --> 00:28:46,421
How will you find a poison...

376
00:28:47,261 --> 00:28:48,621
when you do not even know...

377
00:28:49,661 --> 00:28:51,791
what you are looking for?

378
00:29:01,601 --> 00:29:02,841
The choice is yours.

379
00:29:03,541 --> 00:29:06,481
Be escorted by the Royal Investigation Office's men...

380
00:29:07,081 --> 00:29:08,781
to the throne,

381
00:29:09,651 --> 00:29:12,481
or be surrounded by them...

382
00:29:12,981 --> 00:29:14,451
and be branded a traitor.

383
00:29:15,021 --> 00:29:16,021
How dare you!

384
00:29:16,621 --> 00:29:19,661
- Have you no fear of the skies?
- I have no fear of the skies!

385
00:29:20,221 --> 00:29:23,261
I have already resigned myself to the fiery pit anyway.

386
00:29:47,551 --> 00:29:49,121
You must protect what is yours.

387
00:30:09,641 --> 00:30:11,271
I, Lee Hui, Prince Geumseong,

388
00:30:12,811 --> 00:30:14,641
shall appoint Kim Han Chul, the Minister of War,

389
00:30:15,751 --> 00:30:17,451
as the Left State Councillor...

390
00:30:19,381 --> 00:30:21,321
and a meritorious subject of the Gyesa Year coup.

391
00:30:24,051 --> 00:30:25,721
This I do solemnly promise.

392
00:31:16,941 --> 00:31:18,411
To protect my family,

393
00:31:19,311 --> 00:31:23,351
I became a monstrous king who killed his brother and nephew.

394
00:31:24,051 --> 00:31:28,121
He said one pact would solve it all, making him a coup contributor.

395
00:31:29,251 --> 00:31:30,751
Since I was going to take the throne anyway,

396
00:31:31,621 --> 00:31:33,991
I thought it would all end with just one signature.

397
00:31:35,991 --> 00:31:37,261
But that was just the beginning.

398
00:31:38,031 --> 00:31:40,061
I must become the King's in-law.

399
00:31:40,661 --> 00:31:42,431
Give me the Crown Prince.

400
00:31:43,631 --> 00:31:45,201
You want me to depose the Crown Princess?

401
00:31:46,541 --> 00:31:48,571
- How could you...
- Your Majesty has already...

402
00:31:50,171 --> 00:31:52,111
acknowledged the Gyesa Year incident...

403
00:31:53,041 --> 00:31:54,941
as a coup, have you not?

404
00:31:56,281 --> 00:31:57,681
Your Majesty and I...

405
00:31:58,551 --> 00:32:00,751
are already in the same boat.

406
00:32:06,861 --> 00:32:08,791
One by one, I gave things away.

407
00:32:11,091 --> 00:32:13,531
- Royal Father!
- Your Majesty.

408
00:32:16,171 --> 00:32:17,701
Your Majesty.

409
00:32:20,171 --> 00:32:22,371
Your Majesty.

410
00:32:24,441 --> 00:32:26,441
Your Majesty.

411
00:32:27,511 --> 00:32:28,811
Until I lost everything.

412
00:32:42,491 --> 00:32:45,391
You said I just had to make your daughter the Crown Princess.

413
00:32:45,801 --> 00:32:48,261
So why? Why?

414
00:32:48,661 --> 00:32:49,671
Why...

415
00:32:50,031 --> 00:32:51,871
did you have to kill the Queen as well?

416
00:32:52,501 --> 00:32:54,171
I could not come up with a proper way...

417
00:32:55,241 --> 00:32:58,511
to depose the Crown Princess.

418
00:33:00,611 --> 00:33:02,281
This was your plan all along, was it not?

419
00:33:02,951 --> 00:33:05,651
To kill everyone who could help me and the Crown Prince,

420
00:33:06,181 --> 00:33:09,191
and turn us into puppets that you alone could control.

421
00:33:12,351 --> 00:33:13,361
Power...

422
00:33:14,921 --> 00:33:16,761
is not something one shares.

423
00:33:19,031 --> 00:33:20,731
So, what are you going to do about it?

424
00:33:22,001 --> 00:33:23,731
With those feeble fists of yours,

425
00:33:24,331 --> 00:33:27,041
are you going to behead me?

426
00:33:27,971 --> 00:33:28,971
Or...

427
00:33:30,811 --> 00:33:32,511
will you reveal the secret pact...

428
00:33:33,081 --> 00:33:34,981
and prove that the coup was illegitimate...

429
00:33:35,851 --> 00:33:37,811
all by yourself?

430
00:33:49,291 --> 00:33:50,931
That is right, Your Majesty.

431
00:33:51,431 --> 00:33:53,631
There is nothing...

432
00:33:54,561 --> 00:33:56,331
you can do.

433
00:33:57,401 --> 00:33:59,471
So just stay right where you are.

434
00:34:00,341 --> 00:34:04,771
Do that, and you might just keep your life.

435
00:34:21,921 --> 00:34:23,691
I was a prisoner of that secret pact.

436
00:34:24,931 --> 00:34:26,961
For years, my life was a living nightmare.

437
00:34:28,501 --> 00:34:29,671
They took everything from me.

438
00:34:30,431 --> 00:34:31,731
But you are the one thing I managed to protect.

439
00:34:32,841 --> 00:34:33,841
So, Gang...

440
00:34:35,301 --> 00:34:36,311
You must survive.

441
00:34:37,411 --> 00:34:38,971
Live, even if you have to be disgraced and cowardly.

442
00:34:44,781 --> 00:34:46,281
It was not enough that Mother and the Crown Princess...

443
00:34:48,021 --> 00:34:49,891
were driven to their deaths.

444
00:34:51,421 --> 00:34:54,121
Now, I will never be able to clear their names.

445
00:34:56,161 --> 00:34:59,061
I have to let them remain unjustly accused forever.

446
00:35:00,301 --> 00:35:01,731
And you are telling me to live?

447
00:35:04,301 --> 00:35:05,731
Can you even call that living?

448
00:35:07,501 --> 00:35:09,141
I wanted to take down the Left State Councillor...

449
00:35:10,571 --> 00:35:12,141
and go back to the way things were...

450
00:35:14,281 --> 00:35:16,311
with you, Father.

451
00:35:19,521 --> 00:35:20,721
But now,

452
00:35:25,121 --> 00:35:28,291
I do not think we can ever go back to how things were.

453
00:37:29,041 --> 00:37:30,711
The Crown Princess Consort fled?

454
00:37:31,011 --> 00:37:33,321
Yes. I heard the court maids gossiping...

455
00:37:33,381 --> 00:37:35,781
with my own two ears.

456
00:37:38,551 --> 00:37:40,721
- Let us go to the Detached Palace.
- Yes, Your Majesty.

457
00:37:41,361 --> 00:37:44,631
Your Majesty, what brings you here?

458
00:37:44,731 --> 00:37:46,301
Am I not allowed here?

459
00:37:47,301 --> 00:37:48,361
Open the door.

460
00:37:49,301 --> 00:37:51,830
It is just that the Crown Princess Consort...

461
00:37:51,831 --> 00:37:54,201
is in no condition to receive Your Grace.

462
00:37:54,301 --> 00:37:55,301
Why not?

463
00:37:56,241 --> 00:37:58,311
Did she escape in the night?

464
00:37:58,771 --> 00:38:02,851
Your Majesty, how can you even suggest such a thing?

465
00:38:03,081 --> 00:38:04,111
Open this door!

466
00:38:04,751 --> 00:38:05,811
Your Majesty.

467
00:38:07,751 --> 00:38:09,721
- Get out of my way!
- Your Majesty!

468
00:38:22,801 --> 00:38:24,401
Despite his power, the Left State Councillor...

469
00:38:24,601 --> 00:38:27,171
failed when it came to his own daughter.

470
00:38:29,371 --> 00:38:31,371
Call off the Royal Wedding at once,

471
00:38:31,871 --> 00:38:33,381
and punish the Left State Councillor.

472
00:38:35,881 --> 00:38:37,711
Why do you hesitate?

473
00:38:37,951 --> 00:38:39,550
The Crown Princess Consort...

474
00:38:39,551 --> 00:38:40,981
was not to go outside the Detached Palace,

475
00:38:41,821 --> 00:38:43,151
and yet, she has escaped.

476
00:38:43,551 --> 00:38:47,321
Rumours are spreading among the staff that she eloped in the night.

477
00:38:47,661 --> 00:38:50,431
Are you really just going to let this slide?

478
00:38:52,291 --> 00:38:54,061
Nothing is certain yet.

479
00:38:54,501 --> 00:38:56,531
I will act after we investigate further...

480
00:38:56,601 --> 00:38:58,331
I will not beat around the bush.

481
00:38:59,271 --> 00:39:03,141
The Late King, the Firstborn Prince, and all who died in the Gyesa Year.

482
00:39:05,241 --> 00:39:07,281
Did you kill them all, Your Majesty?

483
00:39:07,441 --> 00:39:10,480
Your Majesty! How can you say such a treasonous thing?

484
00:39:10,481 --> 00:39:14,051
The Late King was in perfect health, and he had the Firstborn Prince.

485
00:39:14,381 --> 00:39:18,721
There was no way you could have taken the throne.

486
00:39:19,151 --> 00:39:20,161
And yet,

487
00:39:20,561 --> 00:39:22,761
how is it that an opportunity that should never have arisen...

488
00:39:23,831 --> 00:39:25,691
went to you?

489
00:39:26,701 --> 00:39:31,701
And why is the Left State Councillor now holding all the power?

490
00:39:34,471 --> 00:39:35,801
How come the Left State Councillor...

491
00:39:36,641 --> 00:39:38,741
is already a free man...

492
00:39:39,611 --> 00:39:40,881
when he was arrested only a few hours ago?

493
00:39:50,621 --> 00:39:52,021
If that secret pact is revealed,

494
00:39:52,721 --> 00:39:54,821
His Majesty will be killed.

495
00:39:56,891 --> 00:39:58,031
And it is all my fault.

496
00:39:59,461 --> 00:40:03,201
My father signed that pact to protect me.

497
00:40:04,901 --> 00:40:08,371
The Crown Princess and Royal Mother died because of me.

498
00:40:19,251 --> 00:40:20,481
But you did not know.

499
00:40:21,081 --> 00:40:22,991
You did not know a single thing.

500
00:40:23,951 --> 00:40:25,491
So why are you blaming yourself?

501
00:40:27,321 --> 00:40:29,091
How can I ever atone for this?

502
00:40:33,261 --> 00:40:35,101
How can I possibly repay this crime?

503
00:40:36,131 --> 00:40:37,131
You are right.

504
00:40:37,971 --> 00:40:39,031
You have to repay them.

505
00:40:40,201 --> 00:40:41,341
Not with penance,

506
00:40:42,271 --> 00:40:44,071
but with revenge.

507
00:40:44,511 --> 00:40:45,511
Revenge?

508
00:40:47,481 --> 00:40:49,111
Because the coup was a success,

509
00:40:49,851 --> 00:40:51,911
the Gyesa Year incident is no longer a treason,

510
00:40:52,651 --> 00:40:54,251
nor is it the Left State Councillor's weakness.

511
00:40:54,581 --> 00:40:56,791
Unless my Royal Father abdicates in favour of Grand Prince Je Un...

512
00:40:57,391 --> 00:40:59,721
and reveals the pact himself.

513
00:41:00,721 --> 00:41:03,761
There is no other way to bring down the Left State Councillor.

514
00:41:05,891 --> 00:41:07,961
Besides, Grand Prince Je Un has already left.

515
00:41:09,001 --> 00:41:10,931
We cannot just drag him back and force him onto the throne.

516
00:41:11,101 --> 00:41:14,541
Even if we could, Je Un is the type to just walk away.

517
00:41:21,241 --> 00:41:22,241
But...

518
00:41:23,081 --> 00:41:24,580
the Crown Princess Consort ran away,

519
00:41:24,581 --> 00:41:26,051
so is that not a crime in its own right?

520
00:41:27,881 --> 00:41:29,551
Normally, that would be considered treason.

521
00:41:32,721 --> 00:41:33,761
Wait a minute.

522
00:41:36,331 --> 00:41:37,761
Why is the Left State Councillor so calm?

523
00:41:37,961 --> 00:41:39,031
Exactly.

524
00:41:39,861 --> 00:41:43,131
He was released last night. He must know she has fled by now.

525
00:41:43,631 --> 00:41:44,631
The Left State Councillor will never give up...

526
00:41:44,632 --> 00:41:46,001
being the King's in-law.

527
00:41:46,671 --> 00:41:48,471
He will bring her back no matter what,

528
00:41:48,941 --> 00:41:50,471
and there is no way he will leave Grand Prince Je Un alone.

529
00:41:52,171 --> 00:41:53,411
If the Left State Councillor catches him...

530
00:41:53,741 --> 00:41:55,211
or if the Queen Dowager finds out,

531
00:41:56,381 --> 00:41:58,551
Grand Prince Je Un will be in deep trouble when he is caught.

532
00:42:01,481 --> 00:42:05,090
- Come take a look over here.
- Hello, there.

533
00:42:05,091 --> 00:42:06,491
Do you have any fish?

534
00:42:08,721 --> 00:42:11,261
- We have fresh ones in the back.
- Are you okay?

535
00:42:11,331 --> 00:42:12,331
I am fine.

536
00:42:15,101 --> 00:42:17,071
This one is really nice and plump.

537
00:42:17,131 --> 00:42:18,931
They are delicious! Come and take a look.

538
00:42:48,531 --> 00:42:49,531
Your Highness!

539
00:42:52,631 --> 00:42:53,801
We are here to escort you.

540
00:42:54,941 --> 00:42:56,041
What are you doing here?

541
00:42:56,711 --> 00:42:59,011
You never move without an order from my father.

542
00:43:00,341 --> 00:43:01,511
I gave the order.

543
00:43:09,521 --> 00:43:11,221
I have come to retrieve what is mine.

544
00:43:11,821 --> 00:43:14,061
It is time you handed her over.

545
00:43:14,761 --> 00:43:18,991
- U Hui does not belong to you.
- Yes. She is mine.

546
00:43:20,201 --> 00:43:24,471
My most useful possession.

547
00:43:29,701 --> 00:43:33,011
I will not allow anyone to use her as a pawn.

548
00:43:39,881 --> 00:43:42,151
- Seize him!
- Household Man.

549
00:43:58,601 --> 00:43:59,601
No!

550
00:44:14,751 --> 00:44:16,251
- No!
- Darn it.

551
00:44:40,911 --> 00:44:43,611
- Grand Prince!
- My lady!

552
00:44:44,681 --> 00:44:45,851
My lord...

553
00:44:58,561 --> 00:45:03,301
You are nothing like the Late King, Grand Prince Je Un.

554
00:45:04,071 --> 00:45:07,901
The Late King was never this recklessly brave.

555
00:45:08,641 --> 00:45:10,311
He had many things he held more dear...

556
00:45:11,511 --> 00:45:13,981
than your mother.

557
00:45:15,441 --> 00:45:16,751
He was quite the coward too.

558
00:45:17,551 --> 00:45:20,021
As if assassinating my Royal Father was not enough,

559
00:45:20,651 --> 00:45:24,821
now you dare insult his honour as well!

560
00:45:24,891 --> 00:45:28,921
Honour? Did the Late King ever have any to begin with?

561
00:45:29,161 --> 00:45:30,861
Left State Councillor!

562
00:45:32,761 --> 00:45:34,061
Left State Councillor!

563
00:45:35,701 --> 00:45:37,731
Going after family is a low blow, is it not?

564
00:45:47,811 --> 00:45:49,711
And going after a royal is high treason.

565
00:45:51,181 --> 00:45:53,781
Back off. Unless you want to lose your heads.

566
00:46:11,331 --> 00:46:15,341
You are too bold for a cornered man, Left State Councillor.

567
00:46:15,741 --> 00:46:19,041
Do I seem cornered to you?

568
00:46:19,241 --> 00:46:21,080
The Crown Princess Consort eloped at night with a man.

569
00:46:21,081 --> 00:46:22,841
I would say that is a big problem.

570
00:46:23,551 --> 00:46:25,251
It is all over for you.

571
00:46:25,381 --> 00:46:26,681
The palace must have realised by now...

572
00:46:26,881 --> 00:46:29,451
the Crown Princess Consort has run away.

573
00:46:30,221 --> 00:46:33,421
Even if you drag her back, can she still become the Crown Princess?

574
00:46:34,021 --> 00:46:36,791
Even if you go back, both you and your daughter...

575
00:46:37,291 --> 00:46:39,091
will just be throwing your lives away.

576
00:46:40,101 --> 00:46:41,531
Throwing our lives away?

577
00:46:42,101 --> 00:46:46,171
So can you not just let them be happy together?

578
00:46:46,671 --> 00:46:49,871
She is your daughter, after all.

579
00:46:53,341 --> 00:46:54,341
That is precisely why...

580
00:46:56,911 --> 00:46:59,511
I cannot tolerate this.

581
00:47:01,381 --> 00:47:03,321
The fact that something of mine...

582
00:47:04,051 --> 00:47:06,791
dared to turn its blade on me.

583
00:47:10,861 --> 00:47:11,861
U Hui.

584
00:47:13,961 --> 00:47:15,931
If my daughter were to die here,

585
00:47:16,561 --> 00:47:18,471
no one would know...

586
00:47:20,041 --> 00:47:22,341
whether she eloped...

587
00:47:23,071 --> 00:47:25,441
- or if Prince Je Un kidnapped her.
- Left State Councillor!

588
00:47:25,511 --> 00:47:26,811
You know very well...

589
00:47:28,081 --> 00:47:31,451
that I still wield that much power, do you not?

590
00:47:33,381 --> 00:47:34,651
The Left State Councillor...

591
00:47:35,251 --> 00:47:37,651
possesses a secret pact that I wrote with my own hand.

592
00:48:00,881 --> 00:48:01,881
I...

593
00:48:04,151 --> 00:48:05,711
will be the one to accept punishment.

594
00:48:08,881 --> 00:48:09,881
Gang.

595
00:48:11,091 --> 00:48:13,191
I will take the punishment.

596
00:48:15,791 --> 00:48:17,661
U Hui must not die.

597
00:48:18,861 --> 00:48:20,901
She cannot die because of me.

598
00:48:22,301 --> 00:48:23,371
Please...

599
00:48:24,771 --> 00:48:26,501
just put down the sword.

600
00:48:40,551 --> 00:48:41,751
Do you really wish...

601
00:48:43,551 --> 00:48:45,691
for blood to be spilled here?

602
00:48:46,861 --> 00:48:48,691
Whether I live or die,

603
00:48:50,091 --> 00:48:52,531
both sides stand to lose something precious.

604
00:48:54,931 --> 00:48:58,401
Let us put this behind us and call a truce for now.

605
00:48:58,931 --> 00:48:59,931
U Hui.

606
00:49:02,271 --> 00:49:03,441
What do you say?

607
00:49:12,781 --> 00:49:14,221
We will do as she says.

608
00:49:22,661 --> 00:49:23,861
Escort the Crown Princess Consort.

609
00:49:28,101 --> 00:49:29,101
U Hui.

610
00:49:30,061 --> 00:49:31,831
I suppose what you held in your hands...

611
00:49:33,441 --> 00:49:35,201
was not the key to my father's downfall...

612
00:49:38,311 --> 00:49:40,011
but simply a foolish dream.

613
00:49:40,641 --> 00:49:41,641
U Hui...

614
00:49:54,061 --> 00:49:55,061
U Hui.

615
00:50:07,241 --> 00:50:08,341
The Left State Councillor...

616
00:50:09,941 --> 00:50:11,771
How was he released?

617
00:50:13,581 --> 00:50:16,511
Why on earth was he let go?

618
00:50:17,811 --> 00:50:19,081
I will explain everything.

619
00:50:29,661 --> 00:50:30,991
So, you are saying...

620
00:50:31,561 --> 00:50:34,031
the Gyesa Year incident was a coup,

621
00:50:34,261 --> 00:50:35,831
and since it succeeded,

622
00:50:37,071 --> 00:50:40,301
the Left State Councillor is free of any crime or weakness.

623
00:50:40,471 --> 00:50:41,601
Is that what you are telling me?

624
00:50:43,971 --> 00:50:45,071
I am so sorry.

625
00:50:45,711 --> 00:50:47,141
He may have been coerced,

626
00:50:48,111 --> 00:50:50,351
but it was cowardice for our Royal Father to ignore...

627
00:50:51,151 --> 00:50:52,711
the Left State Councillor's crimes...

628
00:50:53,881 --> 00:50:55,081
and a great sin against you.

629
00:50:57,821 --> 00:50:59,951
How could that be your fault?

630
00:51:01,361 --> 00:51:02,361
It is just that...

631
00:51:03,321 --> 00:51:06,831
I cannot bring myself to say that it is all okay today.

632
00:51:07,961 --> 00:51:10,701
I told her not to hold back anymore,

633
00:51:11,801 --> 00:51:14,271
but U Hui could not show any anger in the end.

634
00:51:14,971 --> 00:51:16,671
She could not even cry in my arms.

635
00:51:19,711 --> 00:51:21,781
She just held it all in as she left.

636
00:51:43,771 --> 00:51:46,431
Why are you so obsessed with becoming the King's in-law?

637
00:51:47,341 --> 00:51:48,941
You already have everything.

638
00:51:49,401 --> 00:51:51,711
So why do you covet that position so desperately?

639
00:51:53,311 --> 00:51:54,381
I am just curious.

640
00:51:54,911 --> 00:51:56,381
Because I want to be powerful.

641
00:51:56,741 --> 00:51:57,881
How much more powerful?

642
00:51:58,181 --> 00:52:00,321
To allow anyone to be more powerful than me...

643
00:52:01,121 --> 00:52:04,121
is to be prepared to give up everything I have.

644
00:52:06,191 --> 00:52:07,521
I wanted power,

645
00:52:08,421 --> 00:52:10,431
so I placed first in the military service examination.

646
00:52:12,561 --> 00:52:14,931
Even when I thought I had become powerful enough,

647
00:52:15,701 --> 00:52:17,901
I was still weak in the presence of the King.

648
00:52:18,431 --> 00:52:19,801
And even that powerful King...

649
00:52:21,141 --> 00:52:23,401
was rendered powerless by the Queen's Family.

650
00:52:24,641 --> 00:52:26,911
So you decided to become one of the Queen's Family?

651
00:52:28,311 --> 00:52:29,611
To become the most powerful of all?

652
00:52:29,911 --> 00:52:30,981
Power...

653
00:52:32,951 --> 00:52:35,851
is harder to keep than it is to seize.

654
00:52:40,221 --> 00:52:43,361
So, it is time to wake up from this foolish dream...

655
00:52:44,891 --> 00:52:46,261
and live like a flower.

656
00:52:47,401 --> 00:52:48,961
You will take root in this palace.

657
00:52:49,561 --> 00:52:53,271
You will bloom when I tell you to, and you will wither on my command.

658
00:52:54,701 --> 00:52:55,801
If you do just that,

659
00:52:57,811 --> 00:52:59,641
that will be a life well-lived.

660
00:53:12,991 --> 00:53:14,360
Bar the gates to the Detached Palace...

661
00:53:14,361 --> 00:53:16,561
and confine the Crown Princess Consort until the Royal Wedding.

662
00:53:17,031 --> 00:53:18,290
If Crown Princess Consort ever steps foot outside...

663
00:53:18,291 --> 00:53:19,631
the Detached Palace,

664
00:53:20,661 --> 00:53:22,701
for every step she takes,

665
00:53:23,671 --> 00:53:27,001
one of the palace's court attendants will be beheaded.

666
00:53:28,341 --> 00:53:29,771
Yes, Left State Councillor.

667
00:53:39,951 --> 00:53:43,691
Grand Prince Je Un must be heartbroken.

668
00:53:46,191 --> 00:53:50,061
I did not even know my Royal Father made such a secret pact,

669
00:53:51,831 --> 00:53:54,101
and I was running my mouth about us getting revenge together.

670
00:53:55,361 --> 00:53:57,001
I must look like a complete fool.

671
00:53:57,431 --> 00:54:00,741
But you did not know. Why are you blaming yourself again?

672
00:54:01,101 --> 00:54:03,041
I want to take down the Left State Councillor,

673
00:54:06,411 --> 00:54:08,111
but I just do not know how.

674
00:54:25,861 --> 00:54:27,801
You need to get a grip.

675
00:54:29,161 --> 00:54:32,071
Open your eyes and see who your real enemy is.

676
00:54:32,501 --> 00:54:36,771
See exactly where you need to aim your bow.

677
00:54:38,371 --> 00:54:40,371
Do not get bogged down by all this useless guilt...

678
00:54:41,611 --> 00:54:43,911
and let it eat you up inside.

679
00:54:44,811 --> 00:54:46,411
You must be strong.

680
00:54:47,251 --> 00:54:50,321
If the path is blocked, you force your way through.

681
00:54:51,321 --> 00:54:54,921
And if there is no path, who cares? Just build a new one.

682
00:54:55,821 --> 00:54:58,061
And most importantly, do not ever forget...

683
00:54:58,531 --> 00:55:01,861
that I, your swallow, will always be by your side.

684
00:55:02,701 --> 00:55:03,701
Right?

685
00:55:10,671 --> 00:55:11,671
Do you understand?

686
00:55:14,681 --> 00:55:17,111
And who said you could just grab the Crown Prince's face like that?

687
00:55:18,981 --> 00:55:20,051
My apologies.

688
00:55:23,221 --> 00:55:26,621
But did you not say I was the exception?

689
00:55:27,861 --> 00:55:30,021
What, are you a mind reader now?

690
00:55:30,861 --> 00:55:34,731
You know exactly what I am thinking without me saying a word.

691
00:55:36,301 --> 00:55:37,431
Mind reading?

692
00:55:38,301 --> 00:55:39,301
That is right.

693
00:55:39,631 --> 00:55:44,011
Go on then. Keep reading my mind.

694
00:55:48,881 --> 00:55:50,241
Mind reading.

695
00:56:05,461 --> 00:56:09,101
Your Royal Highness. I heard you were feeling unwell.

696
00:56:09,831 --> 00:56:11,971
Are you fully recovered now?

697
00:56:12,631 --> 00:56:14,771
Yes, more or less.

698
00:56:15,301 --> 00:56:16,570
Your Highness, as the misunderstanding...

699
00:56:16,571 --> 00:56:18,871
with the Left State Councillor has been cleared,

700
00:56:19,011 --> 00:56:22,941
it is time to close the case on the Jimjo incident.

701
00:56:23,681 --> 00:56:24,711
The Jimjo...

702
00:56:25,251 --> 00:56:28,921
was raised by the former Chief Court Lady Jo alone.

703
00:56:29,621 --> 00:56:31,591
As for her niece who framed the Royal Concubine,

704
00:56:32,121 --> 00:56:33,791
she will be exiled and made a government slave.

705
00:56:34,061 --> 00:56:35,261
And with that, the Jimjo incident...

706
00:56:38,731 --> 00:56:40,031
is hereby closed.

707
00:56:40,761 --> 00:56:42,701
- Yes, Your Royal Highness!
- Yes, Your Royal Highness!

708
00:56:44,701 --> 00:56:47,641
Your Royal Highness, this prolonged drought...

709
00:56:47,741 --> 00:56:50,241
is causing our people immense suffering.

710
00:56:50,571 --> 00:56:54,181
This drought persists because yin and yang are unbalanced.

711
00:56:54,441 --> 00:56:56,641
Proceeding with the Royal Wedding without delay...

712
00:56:57,851 --> 00:56:59,781
is the correct course of action.

713
00:57:00,181 --> 00:57:01,421
Yes, Your Highness.

714
00:57:01,451 --> 00:57:04,691
The Royal Wedding must go on to stabilize ancestors and state.

715
00:57:05,051 --> 00:57:08,291
And appease the skies.

716
00:57:23,101 --> 00:57:26,140
They say a puppy will not fear a tiger.

717
00:57:26,141 --> 00:57:27,310
And that fits him perfectly.

718
00:57:27,311 --> 00:57:28,641
I knew he would tuck his tail and run.

719
00:57:29,241 --> 00:57:33,551
How dare he arrest the Left State Councillor?

720
00:57:35,681 --> 00:57:37,451
You can rest easy now.

721
00:57:38,291 --> 00:57:40,621
The Royal Wedding is right around the corner.

722
00:57:41,161 --> 00:57:45,231
This is a day to celebrate your win. Why are you so quiet?

723
00:57:46,591 --> 00:57:48,201
We should at least go to Eunwol Pavilion.

724
00:57:49,401 --> 00:57:51,530
Goodness. Why is it always...

725
00:57:51,531 --> 00:57:53,571
the courtesan house with you, Minister Ja Gyeong?

726
00:57:55,071 --> 00:57:57,071
Do you think I am suggesting it for no reason?

727
00:57:57,841 --> 00:57:59,411
The other day, at Eunwol Pavilion,

728
00:58:00,141 --> 00:58:01,681
I saw Hong Nan.

729
00:58:03,111 --> 00:58:05,951
- The gisaeng from Eunwol Pavilion?
- Yes.

730
00:58:06,111 --> 00:58:08,121
Did she not suddenly disappear a few years ago?

731
00:58:08,251 --> 00:58:11,151
See? I knew you would be interested.

732
00:58:11,491 --> 00:58:13,551
Maybe she got kicked out of her concubine's position.

733
00:58:13,991 --> 00:58:17,291
- She was back at Eunwol Pavilion.
- A concubine?

734
00:58:18,131 --> 00:58:20,091
Were she and the late deposed Crown Princess's brother...

735
00:58:20,391 --> 00:58:22,061
not madly in love with each other?

736
00:58:22,431 --> 00:58:26,371
After he died, she sold everything, left the registry, and vanished.

737
00:58:26,501 --> 00:58:30,041
What? She turned down my offer for some worthless guy?

738
00:58:30,601 --> 00:58:31,611
Unbelievable.

739
00:58:32,111 --> 00:58:33,111
Wait.

740
00:58:34,381 --> 00:58:36,241
Did you just say the deposed Crown Princess's brother?

741
00:58:37,111 --> 00:58:38,281
Yes.

742
00:58:38,551 --> 00:58:39,811
What is it?

743
00:58:41,251 --> 00:58:42,321
This could be...

744
00:58:43,051 --> 00:58:45,851
something much bigger.

745
00:58:46,791 --> 00:58:48,661
Something that gives us leverage over the Crown Prince.

746
00:58:50,391 --> 00:58:51,391
Something huge.

747
00:58:56,961 --> 00:58:59,871
Find out all you can about a gisaeng from Eunwol Pavilion named Hong Nan,

748
00:59:00,201 --> 00:59:01,341
and find out where she's staying.

749
00:59:01,871 --> 00:59:02,871
Yes, sir.

750
00:59:06,141 --> 00:59:07,541
Do you have something to report?

751
00:59:08,211 --> 00:59:10,681
It is about the Royal Concubine's neighbours from Boryeong.

752
00:59:13,611 --> 00:59:15,981
- I have taken care of them.
- Good.

753
00:59:16,381 --> 00:59:17,391
You may go.

754
00:59:23,861 --> 00:59:24,931
If...

755
00:59:25,361 --> 00:59:27,431
the Royal Concubine is actually the deposed Crown Princess,

756
00:59:28,461 --> 00:59:31,401
then there is only one person who could have gotten her out.

757
00:59:34,901 --> 00:59:36,441
This is absurd.

758
00:59:36,741 --> 00:59:38,271
The Crown Princess Consort ran away.

759
00:59:38,441 --> 00:59:40,311
Her whole family should face annihilation for this.

760
00:59:40,411 --> 00:59:41,681
And you are telling me there will be a Royal Wedding?

761
00:59:42,981 --> 00:59:44,710
The King has confined the Crown Princess Consort...

762
00:59:44,711 --> 00:59:46,211
to the Detached Palace until the Royal Wedding.

763
00:59:46,511 --> 00:59:49,351
He also ordered her to be cut off from all outside contact.

764
00:59:51,291 --> 00:59:53,190
By law, the Crown Princess Consort is not allowed to leave...

765
00:59:53,191 --> 00:59:56,221
the Detached Palace to begin with.

766
00:59:56,391 --> 00:59:59,831
Are you trying to deceive me? What is the meaning of this?

767
01:00:00,191 --> 01:00:02,131
Your Majesty, you seem to have misunderstood.

768
01:00:02,501 --> 01:00:05,101
The Crown Princess Consort did not run away.

769
01:00:05,701 --> 01:00:06,871
She collapsed.

770
01:00:08,201 --> 01:00:11,541
And she just had to collapse outside of the Detached Palace?

771
01:00:12,071 --> 01:00:15,011
- For that long?
- When her father was arrested,

772
01:00:15,381 --> 01:00:19,281
I let her go, fearing she would be sick with worry over her father.

773
01:00:19,511 --> 01:00:22,681
She collapsed in shock on the way, recovering at a private house.

774
01:00:22,851 --> 01:00:24,190
The story must have been distorted.

775
01:00:24,191 --> 01:00:25,551
You create a problem to fix it?

776
01:00:26,591 --> 01:00:28,491
It was you who ordered the Left State Councillor's arrest,

777
01:00:28,861 --> 01:00:30,391
was it not?

778
01:00:33,331 --> 01:00:34,661
Forgive me, Your Majesty.

779
01:00:38,971 --> 01:00:40,631
What in the world is going on?

780
01:00:40,801 --> 01:00:42,471
Why are His Majesty and you...

781
01:00:42,801 --> 01:00:44,911
so helpless against the Left State Councillor?

782
01:00:45,271 --> 01:00:47,071
What kind of leverage does he have on you...

783
01:00:47,681 --> 01:00:51,051
that makes you continue with this absurd charade?

784
01:00:53,851 --> 01:00:55,251
Forgive me, Your Majesty.

785
01:00:56,281 --> 01:00:59,191
If you will just keep repeating "forgive me" like a parrot,

786
01:01:00,051 --> 01:01:01,091
then get out.

787
01:01:04,591 --> 01:01:05,631
Then,

788
01:01:06,191 --> 01:01:07,601
I shall take my leave.

789
01:01:15,701 --> 01:01:16,771
Crown Prince.

790
01:01:19,811 --> 01:01:22,341
We have both lost people, have we not?

791
01:01:23,141 --> 01:01:24,551
People we held dear.

792
01:01:29,681 --> 01:01:31,751
Are you going to let fear paralyse you...

793
01:01:32,821 --> 01:01:33,921
and walk right back into...

794
01:01:34,491 --> 01:01:36,561
that fiery pit again?

795
01:02:00,881 --> 01:02:02,021
The Left State Councillor...

796
01:02:02,521 --> 01:02:05,521
Why on earth was he let go?

797
01:02:08,261 --> 01:02:09,961
I was a prisoner of that secret pact.

798
01:02:11,161 --> 01:02:12,991
For years, my life was a living nightmare.

799
01:02:14,231 --> 01:02:17,101
Royal Mother! What is happening?

800
01:02:18,071 --> 01:02:19,071
Royal Mother.

801
01:02:26,171 --> 01:02:28,611
We have both lost people, have we not?

802
01:02:29,541 --> 01:02:31,011
People we held dear.

803
01:02:32,251 --> 01:02:34,351
Are you going to let fear paralyse you...

804
01:02:35,151 --> 01:02:36,221
and walk right back into...

805
01:02:36,421 --> 01:02:38,591
that fiery pit again?

806
01:02:44,861 --> 01:02:46,331
You must be strong.

807
01:02:47,231 --> 01:02:48,501
If your path is blocked,

808
01:02:49,031 --> 01:02:50,301
you force your way through.

809
01:02:51,271 --> 01:02:54,801
And if there is no path, who cares? Just build a new one.

810
01:03:05,551 --> 01:03:07,351
Abdicate the throne to Grand Prince Je Un.

811
01:03:07,681 --> 01:03:11,191
Then, Your Majesty, you must reveal the secret pact yourself.

812
01:03:11,591 --> 01:03:13,891
Do you have any idea what will happen if I do?

813
01:03:14,261 --> 01:03:15,991
It would not be an abdication. You would be dethroned.

814
01:03:16,321 --> 01:03:17,961
And not just Your Majesty, but I, too,

815
01:03:18,761 --> 01:03:20,231
will be dragged down into the abyss.

816
01:03:20,391 --> 01:03:22,201
You know that, and you still dare say such a thing?

817
01:03:23,631 --> 01:03:25,930
You think I like having the Left State Councillor around?

818
01:03:25,931 --> 01:03:27,271
If he falls,

819
01:03:27,601 --> 01:03:29,871
then I, who led a coup without just cause,

820
01:03:30,401 --> 01:03:32,641
and you will have no one left to protect us.

821
01:03:32,941 --> 01:03:34,911
They will all be scrambling to tear us down.

822
01:03:35,311 --> 01:03:39,481
If Je Un takes the throne, he will claim to avenge the Late King.

823
01:03:39,711 --> 01:03:41,481
Which means he will have to kill both you and me.

824
01:03:41,681 --> 01:03:45,651
So you will just sit there, weighing the consequences,

825
01:03:45,721 --> 01:03:47,121
and do absolutely nothing?

826
01:03:48,721 --> 01:03:50,591
Did you not say it yourself, Your Majesty?

827
01:03:51,331 --> 01:03:52,961
That you have been living in a nightmare since that day.

828
01:03:53,991 --> 01:03:56,031
Anything has to be better than nightmare, right?

829
01:03:57,101 --> 01:03:59,031
We should return what we took unjustly...

830
01:03:59,331 --> 01:04:01,641
and take back what was stolen from us.

831
01:04:02,271 --> 01:04:05,541
I will prove you signed the pact under duress,

832
01:04:06,411 --> 01:04:08,081
and I will destroy the Left State Councillor!

833
01:04:10,281 --> 01:04:12,481
This reckless path you are on.

834
01:04:14,481 --> 01:04:15,951
Is it because of the Royal Concubine?

835
01:04:16,581 --> 01:04:17,851
I am doing this for myself.

836
01:04:19,591 --> 01:04:21,761
I failed to protect my mother, and the Crown Princess.

837
01:04:23,091 --> 01:04:24,121
If I...

838
01:04:25,261 --> 01:04:26,961
lose the woman I love again,

839
01:04:28,701 --> 01:04:29,861
I will die.

840
01:04:33,171 --> 01:04:35,971
My mind is made up. So,

841
01:04:37,471 --> 01:04:39,541
I ask that you make yours, Your Majesty.

842
01:04:46,511 --> 01:04:49,251
If the Crown Prince confronts the Left State Councillor,

843
01:04:51,521 --> 01:04:53,750
the Left State Councillor will target the Royal Concubine first,

844
01:04:53,751 --> 01:04:54,821
seeing her as his weakness.

845
01:04:57,621 --> 01:04:58,991
That is the kind of man he is.

846
01:05:02,801 --> 01:05:04,261
I must see Hong Nan.

847
01:05:14,641 --> 01:05:16,811
The Crown Princess, whom I thought dead,

848
01:05:18,681 --> 01:05:20,351
has returned as the Royal Concubine.

849
01:05:23,821 --> 01:05:25,221
Was this your doing?

850
01:05:25,651 --> 01:05:26,751
Her Highness...

851
01:05:27,251 --> 01:05:29,621
threw herself into the icy water five years ago.

852
01:05:31,331 --> 01:05:33,391
She lost all of her memories then.

853
01:05:34,561 --> 01:05:35,561
So I...

854
01:05:36,501 --> 01:05:38,531
made everyone believe she was dead.

855
01:05:39,271 --> 01:05:40,671
She lost her memories?

856
01:05:41,671 --> 01:05:43,471
Why would the Crown Princess make such a choice?

857
01:05:43,871 --> 01:05:46,011
- I distinctly...
- You gave her a letter.

858
01:05:46,841 --> 01:05:48,710
A letter to fake her death and flee...

859
01:05:48,711 --> 01:05:50,581
the day before she would be poisoned.

860
01:05:51,711 --> 01:05:53,450
You knew exactly how the Crown Prince...

861
01:05:53,451 --> 01:05:55,081
and the Crown Princess felt for one another,

862
01:05:55,651 --> 01:05:58,691
yet what you gave her that day was not a letter.

863
01:05:58,751 --> 01:06:02,191
It was to ease your pathetic guilt. And that...

864
01:06:03,721 --> 01:06:05,131
was a death sentence,

865
01:06:06,291 --> 01:06:09,561
- not a chance to live!
- You insolent wench! How dare you?

866
01:06:09,661 --> 01:06:13,301
Fine. Since I am already insolent, I will say what I have to say.

867
01:06:13,901 --> 01:06:16,641
Did you truly wish for Her Highness to escape...

868
01:06:17,241 --> 01:06:19,241
and live on safely?

869
01:06:20,171 --> 01:06:23,341
Or were you just hoping she would take her own life for you?

870
01:06:29,421 --> 01:06:30,421
Your Majesty.

871
01:06:34,021 --> 01:06:35,021
This time,

872
01:06:38,291 --> 01:06:39,991
you must save Her Highness.

873
01:06:42,001 --> 01:06:43,461
It has been ages since we had meat!

874
01:06:43,501 --> 01:06:44,671
Eat up.

875
01:06:48,441 --> 01:06:49,501
Hong Nan.

876
01:06:50,071 --> 01:06:51,341
Come have a bite.

877
01:06:52,011 --> 01:06:53,171
I am fine, thank you.

878
01:06:53,841 --> 01:06:57,141
More importantly, after you eat, you need to pack your things.

879
01:06:57,441 --> 01:06:58,881
We are leaving for Qing.

880
01:07:05,651 --> 01:07:08,221
Technically speaking, to the Crown Prince,

881
01:07:08,291 --> 01:07:10,321
we are his parents-in-law.

882
01:07:11,261 --> 01:07:12,731
Sorry to bring this up while we are eating.

883
01:07:13,231 --> 01:07:15,630
When you buy a house, you get the outhouse too.

884
01:07:15,631 --> 01:07:17,031
They just took our Dal,

885
01:07:17,101 --> 01:07:21,001
and now they are exiling us to Qing. That is not right.

886
01:07:21,471 --> 01:07:23,441
- Just eat.
- All right.

887
01:07:24,371 --> 01:07:25,571
Well...

888
01:07:26,841 --> 01:07:27,841
But why?

889
01:07:28,641 --> 01:07:31,211
Is it because we are a runaway court lady and eunuch?

890
01:07:31,651 --> 01:07:34,251
Are we a burden to Dal?

891
01:07:34,851 --> 01:07:36,781
Dal is coming with us.

892
01:07:37,381 --> 01:07:38,391
What?

893
01:07:39,291 --> 01:07:41,091
Are you still half asleep?

894
01:07:41,721 --> 01:07:44,691
She is the Royal Concubine. Why would she go to Qing?

895
01:07:53,471 --> 01:07:54,571
The truth is, Dal...

896
01:07:55,941 --> 01:07:57,571
is the supposedly...

897
01:07:58,341 --> 01:07:59,811
the deceased Crown Princess.

898
01:08:04,041 --> 01:08:05,051
My goodness.

899
01:08:17,061 --> 01:08:18,291
I heard that your family...

900
01:08:19,661 --> 01:08:21,801
is staying at Unjeong Palace.

901
01:08:22,461 --> 01:08:23,631
My apologies, Your Majesty.

902
01:08:25,171 --> 01:08:26,671
I did not summon you here to reprimand you.

903
01:08:27,831 --> 01:08:29,341
However, it is against palace protocol,

904
01:08:30,301 --> 01:08:31,971
so I will arrange a separate residence for them.

905
01:08:32,641 --> 01:08:34,211
Go and discuss it with your family.

906
01:08:34,641 --> 01:08:35,711
Thank you, Your Majesty.

907
01:08:37,081 --> 01:08:38,711
However, we must be mindful of prying eyes,

908
01:08:40,111 --> 01:08:41,481
so be discreet.

909
01:08:41,751 --> 01:08:42,851
Yes, Your Majesty.

910
01:08:45,091 --> 01:08:47,351
Then I shall take my leave.

911
01:08:52,331 --> 01:08:53,391
My dear.

912
01:09:00,471 --> 01:09:01,571
In a commoner's home,

913
01:09:03,541 --> 01:09:05,241
is that not what they call a daughter-in-law?

914
01:09:06,741 --> 01:09:09,041
I just wanted to call you that once.

915
01:09:12,681 --> 01:09:13,811
You may go.

916
01:09:22,291 --> 01:09:23,721
For your thoughtfulness,

917
01:09:24,491 --> 01:09:25,891
I am sincerely grateful.

918
01:09:54,421 --> 01:09:55,421
The Crown Prince's Concubine.

919
01:09:56,161 --> 01:09:57,191
No.

920
01:09:58,991 --> 01:10:00,291
Kill the Crown Princess.

921
01:10:03,161 --> 01:10:04,931
Set fire to the Royal Concubine's quarters...

922
01:10:05,801 --> 01:10:07,731
and place a body of a similar build inside.

923
01:10:08,601 --> 01:10:11,271
I must make the Crown Princess dead to the world once more.

924
01:10:38,701 --> 01:10:39,971
Welcome, Your Highness, the Crown Princess.

925
01:10:40,631 --> 01:10:44,001
Goodness. My apologies. Welcome, Royal Concubine.

926
01:10:46,311 --> 01:10:47,511
It is all right.

927
01:10:48,281 --> 01:10:50,411
But do I really look that much like her?

928
01:10:50,781 --> 01:10:52,981
Why is everyone so shocked when they see me?

929
01:10:54,981 --> 01:10:58,451
With a mole on your nose, you would be her spitting image.

930
01:10:59,091 --> 01:11:00,291
A mole?

931
01:11:05,561 --> 01:11:07,161
Once every 3 months, for 15 minutes,

932
01:11:07,531 --> 01:11:09,031
you must cover the mole on your nose.

933
01:11:09,431 --> 01:11:12,371
No one should ever recognise you.

934
01:11:14,231 --> 01:11:17,041
Hong Nan has stepped out for a moment,

935
01:11:17,101 --> 01:11:18,611
so please come inside for now.

936
01:11:19,041 --> 01:11:22,041
- The sun is scorching. Come.
- Sure.

937
01:11:40,361 --> 01:11:41,861
Are you upset about...

938
01:11:42,461 --> 01:11:44,031
what the servant said earlier?

939
01:11:45,431 --> 01:11:46,431
No.

940
01:11:47,301 --> 01:11:49,901
What do you mean, "no"? It is written all over your face.

941
01:11:50,741 --> 01:11:51,911
I told you, I am not.

942
01:12:01,081 --> 01:12:03,721
Yeon Sim, I bet your first love is going to come true.

943
01:12:04,951 --> 01:12:06,921
Are you praying for my execution?

944
01:12:07,191 --> 01:12:09,791
If a court lady's first love comes true, she loses her head.

945
01:12:10,091 --> 01:12:12,661
Gosh. That is not what I meant.

946
01:12:13,691 --> 01:12:15,931
In that case, may you live a long and single life.

947
01:12:17,331 --> 01:12:19,671
- Is that meant to be a blessing?
- Of course it is.

948
01:12:21,101 --> 01:12:23,771
But what do flower petals have to do with first love, anyway?

949
01:12:24,641 --> 01:12:25,741
You do not know?

950
01:12:26,111 --> 01:12:29,781
- Catch a petal, your first love...
- Do you know the saying?

951
01:12:32,151 --> 01:12:34,151
If you happen to catch a falling flower petal,

952
01:12:34,651 --> 01:12:35,880
do you know what happens?

953
01:12:35,881 --> 01:12:37,621
If you catch a falling petal,

954
01:12:39,951 --> 01:12:41,321
your first love will come true.

955
01:13:01,711 --> 01:13:02,911
This one thing...

956
01:13:03,611 --> 01:13:04,811
is mine.

957
01:13:21,531 --> 01:13:22,531
Mangdeok.

958
01:13:28,971 --> 01:13:29,971
Your Highness.

959
01:13:40,951 --> 01:13:41,951
Come here.

960
01:13:43,181 --> 01:13:44,581
Gently piling up.

961
01:13:44,891 --> 01:13:47,351
It is as if little blessings are piling up like snow.

962
01:13:48,661 --> 01:13:50,861
Does it not feel like a promise of happiness?

963
01:14:00,431 --> 01:14:01,431
My lord!

964
01:14:04,401 --> 01:14:06,011
Your small blessing for today.

965
01:14:09,881 --> 01:14:11,311
It is so beautiful.

966
01:14:13,581 --> 01:14:14,751
It truly is.

967
01:14:25,961 --> 01:14:28,231
Your Highness. Are you all right?

968
01:14:28,431 --> 01:14:29,861
You are the sole exception.

969
01:14:32,331 --> 01:14:33,501
This one thing...

970
01:14:35,071 --> 01:14:36,241
is mine.

971
01:14:43,981 --> 01:14:44,981
Your Highness.

972
01:14:45,511 --> 01:14:46,511
Your Highness.

973
01:14:49,781 --> 01:14:53,791
The King will order you poison. You must flee now, Your Highness!

974
01:15:00,091 --> 01:15:01,631
Hong Nan...

975
01:15:06,371 --> 01:15:08,171
Why did you deceive me?

976
01:15:16,611 --> 01:15:17,681
Why?

977
01:15:28,821 --> 01:15:33,591
(Moon River)

978
01:15:48,911 --> 01:15:51,311
Have your memories returned?

979
01:15:51,641 --> 01:15:55,081
The memories are back, but I am completely lost.

980
01:15:55,181 --> 01:15:57,050
You want me to overthrow you and His Majesty...

981
01:15:57,051 --> 01:15:58,821
and take the throne for myself?

982
01:15:58,951 --> 01:16:01,621
Look at this mess the Left State Councillor has caused.

983
01:16:01,761 --> 01:16:03,960
The Left State Councillor is a scary man.

984
01:16:03,961 --> 01:16:05,891
He will harm the Crown Princess, no matter what.

985
01:16:05,961 --> 01:16:07,791
What are you talking about?

986
01:16:08,091 --> 01:16:10,801
There is no time. You have to escape.

987
01:16:10,861 --> 01:16:12,630
I despise the royals who killed my family.

988
01:16:12,631 --> 01:16:14,001
And I despise you too, Your Highness.

989
01:16:14,231 --> 01:16:17,301
I never want to see you again, Your Highness.
