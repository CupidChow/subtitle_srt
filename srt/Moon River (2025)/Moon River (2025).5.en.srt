1
00:00:08,980 --> 00:00:10,250
(All people, incidents, and backgrounds...)

2
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:11,620
(in this drama are fictitious and unrelated to reality.)

3
00:00:11,680 --> 00:00:12,950
(Also, children and animals were filmed under production guidelines.)

4
00:00:34,010 --> 00:00:36,210
The red string of fate, once forcibly severed,

5
00:00:36,270 --> 00:00:39,380
has found its match and begun to thrash wildly.

6
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:41,910
It is out of my hands now.

7
00:00:42,580 --> 00:00:43,580
You two...

8
00:00:43,720 --> 00:00:47,750
will just have to navigate this cruel fate yourselves.

9
00:01:25,090 --> 00:01:28,890
(Chapter Five: Walk a Mile in My Shoes)

10
00:01:41,110 --> 00:01:44,410
Are you awake? You fainted when you fell into the water.

11
00:01:44,540 --> 00:01:47,750
The Royal Physician stopped by. He said you are going to be fine.

12
00:01:50,380 --> 00:01:52,180
The Royal Physician is the Left State Councilor's man,

13
00:01:53,720 --> 00:01:55,690
so he might report things he should not.

14
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:59,860
Good. Go get Shin Won and Se Dol for me.

15
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:01,590
I have to go to the palace.

16
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,360
Why would you go to the palace?

17
00:02:07,700 --> 00:02:10,070
Wait. Why are you suddenly so informal?

18
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:12,700
Give you an inch, and you take a mile, right?

19
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:18,880
What did you dress me in?

20
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:20,450
Wait.

21
00:02:30,420 --> 00:02:31,420
It is gone.

22
00:02:33,260 --> 00:02:36,390
It cannot be. How can it be gone? What...

23
00:02:36,730 --> 00:02:39,900
This... It is gone. Where did it go?

24
00:02:40,130 --> 00:02:44,100
Why? Where... Where did it go?

25
00:02:45,770 --> 00:02:47,940
Where did it go? No, that is impossible.

26
00:02:47,970 --> 00:02:49,410
No, hold on.

27
00:02:50,010 --> 00:02:51,010
This...

28
00:02:51,340 --> 00:02:53,609
What is it? Did you lose something? Is it important?

29
00:02:53,610 --> 00:02:54,779
More than important.

30
00:02:54,780 --> 00:02:56,480
The fate of the 500-year-old royals depends on it.

31
00:02:56,910 --> 00:02:58,950
No, this has to be a dream. Right?

32
00:02:59,020 --> 00:03:00,149
- Lee Gang, snap out of it. - You cannot possibly have that.

33
00:03:00,150 --> 00:03:01,189
I will get you a new one... No.

34
00:03:01,190 --> 00:03:02,949
- No, why? - I will get you a better one,

35
00:03:02,950 --> 00:03:04,989
- so calm down. - Calm down?

36
00:03:04,990 --> 00:03:06,320
You think you would be calm in my shoes?

37
00:03:06,390 --> 00:03:09,730
It is gone. Not just anything. My manhood is gone.

38
00:03:10,330 --> 00:03:11,460
And what is this?

39
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:14,569
- I have no idea what you mean. - Why? What is this?

40
00:03:14,570 --> 00:03:16,300
- Why are these... - Dal, are you all right?

41
00:03:16,730 --> 00:03:19,200
I am the one who fell in the water, so why are you the one acting crazy?

42
00:03:19,270 --> 00:03:20,300
Who are you calling Dal?

43
00:03:25,780 --> 00:03:27,140
Why is her face...

44
00:03:27,850 --> 00:03:28,950
here?

45
00:03:34,190 --> 00:03:35,190
My face.

46
00:03:37,460 --> 00:03:38,620
Where did my face go?

47
00:03:46,330 --> 00:03:48,500
What in the world?

48
00:03:59,180 --> 00:04:02,450
Why is this here?

49
00:04:04,580 --> 00:04:06,820
A rash, Your Highness? Shall I call the Royal Physician?

50
00:04:07,590 --> 00:04:08,950
Let me take a look first.

51
00:04:09,820 --> 00:04:11,520
Hey, where do you think you are looking?

52
00:04:26,140 --> 00:04:27,240
That...

53
00:04:28,510 --> 00:04:30,010
That...

54
00:04:34,410 --> 00:04:36,480
- Your Highness. - Your Highness.

55
00:04:36,550 --> 00:04:38,420
- Your Highness. - What is it?

56
00:04:39,220 --> 00:04:40,220
Your Highness.

57
00:04:40,590 --> 00:04:42,620
- Your Highness. - Your Highness.

58
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:46,290
- Your Highness. - Your Highness.

59
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:02,010
How could he try to cut it with his own hands?

60
00:05:06,310 --> 00:05:10,780
- Please kill me, Your Highness. - Kill you? For what?

61
00:05:12,780 --> 00:05:14,120
Forgive my impertinence, Your Highness.

62
00:05:22,430 --> 00:05:23,460
What?

63
00:05:24,730 --> 00:05:27,160
What is this? Why are you holding me bridal-style?

64
00:05:27,260 --> 00:05:29,200
Because if I am not careful, you might actually turn into one.

65
00:05:30,970 --> 00:05:31,970
Put...

66
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:34,470
Put me down!

67
00:05:46,820 --> 00:05:47,890
What?

68
00:05:54,130 --> 00:05:55,130
What?

69
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:00,730
Wait, what is this?

70
00:06:01,670 --> 00:06:03,370
Why do I have that guy's face?

71
00:06:25,860 --> 00:06:28,430
You mean you are Gang?

72
00:06:29,230 --> 00:06:30,290
The Crown Prince?

73
00:06:31,130 --> 00:06:32,160
Yes.

74
00:06:32,430 --> 00:06:34,130
I know it is hard to believe, but it is true.

75
00:06:34,770 --> 00:06:36,830
So, you must take me to the palace at once.

76
00:06:37,300 --> 00:06:40,039
Of course, the Crown Prince must be in a palace.

77
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:41,040
In that case,

78
00:06:41,070 --> 00:06:42,940
shall I take you to the Crown Prince's quarters?

79
00:06:43,010 --> 00:06:44,080
Yes.

80
00:06:44,580 --> 00:06:48,380
I knew you would believe me. We must hurry to the palace.

81
00:06:51,350 --> 00:06:54,590
Dal. How badly are you hurt?

82
00:06:56,250 --> 00:06:59,460
- You do not have a fever. - How dare you, you insolent fool.

83
00:06:59,860 --> 00:07:01,960
Is this how you abuse your royal status?

84
00:07:02,130 --> 00:07:04,260
Harassing women in broad daylight by touching their foreheads?

85
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,030
Darn it.

86
00:07:09,230 --> 00:07:10,970
That, I almost said.

87
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:14,610
It feels like I have already heard every insult,

88
00:07:15,270 --> 00:07:16,640
but I must be imagining things.

89
00:07:17,510 --> 00:07:18,580
Whatever.

90
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:21,980
Where are you going?

91
00:07:25,950 --> 00:07:27,220
Dal.

92
00:07:40,700 --> 00:07:42,800
Instead of poking me with all these needles,

93
00:07:43,370 --> 00:07:45,500
I need to get out of the palace.

94
00:07:45,670 --> 00:07:47,740
His Majesty has ordered you to be confined.

95
00:07:48,110 --> 00:07:49,410
Confined?

96
00:07:50,070 --> 00:07:53,180
- What does that mean? - Your Highness, are you in pain?

97
00:07:54,010 --> 00:07:57,350
How did you fall in the water? You hate it.

98
00:07:57,410 --> 00:07:58,720
You should have been more careful.

99
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:01,650
Something also seems a bit off with you.

100
00:08:03,290 --> 00:08:07,090
His Majesty has ordered you not to take a single step...

101
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:08,560
outside of your quarters.

102
00:08:10,660 --> 00:08:12,260
Then, my body...

103
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:14,700
No, I mean Dal.

104
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,830
Bring me that girl, Dal.

105
00:08:19,670 --> 00:08:22,270
See the moon? Your Highness, when you recover,

106
00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:25,339
I will arrange for a magnificent moon-viewing for you.

107
00:08:25,340 --> 00:08:26,380
Goodness.

108
00:08:26,780 --> 00:08:29,550
No, not the moon!

109
00:08:29,810 --> 00:08:31,719
Dal, the person, with four limbs.

110
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:33,849
Bring me my body!

111
00:08:33,850 --> 00:08:34,950
Goodness.

112
00:08:36,450 --> 00:08:40,360
This is the last needle. You must remain calm, Your Highness.

113
00:08:40,690 --> 00:08:42,060
Why is everything forbidden?

114
00:08:43,330 --> 00:08:45,200
Oh, my.

115
00:08:45,730 --> 00:08:46,760
Wait.

116
00:08:47,130 --> 00:08:49,199
Where are you putting that?

117
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:51,370
On the affected area.

118
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:52,570
The affected area?

119
00:08:53,540 --> 00:08:54,710
On my head?

120
00:08:55,310 --> 00:08:57,339
What do you think I am?

121
00:08:57,340 --> 00:08:59,910
Am I a human pincushion to you?

122
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:01,810
Gosh.

123
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:06,850
As soon as the Crown Prince awoke,

124
00:09:07,490 --> 00:09:09,690
he kept asking for someone named Dal?

125
00:09:10,490 --> 00:09:11,490
Yes.

126
00:09:11,890 --> 00:09:14,330
The Royal Physician heard it himself.

127
00:09:15,260 --> 00:09:16,260
Could it be...

128
00:09:16,860 --> 00:09:19,660
the peddler His Highness saved that one time?

129
00:09:19,860 --> 00:09:21,029
I will look into it.

130
00:09:21,030 --> 00:09:22,030
(Chief Court Lady Jo Myung Im)

131
00:09:22,070 --> 00:09:23,070
And if...

132
00:09:23,330 --> 00:09:26,270
she is the same peddler, what should be done?

133
00:09:32,010 --> 00:09:33,110
Let go of me!

134
00:09:34,650 --> 00:09:36,609
You were asking for that peddler so desperately...

135
00:09:36,610 --> 00:09:38,050
in front of the Royal Physician.

136
00:09:38,180 --> 00:09:40,219
What are you going to do now?

137
00:09:40,220 --> 00:09:41,550
If the Left State Councilor sees the girl...

138
00:09:41,620 --> 00:09:42,950
who looks just like the late Crown Princess...

139
00:09:43,790 --> 00:09:45,560
Gosh! What are we going to do?

140
00:09:46,860 --> 00:09:48,160
So what if he sees her?

141
00:09:48,460 --> 00:09:49,630
He will kill her.

142
00:09:50,060 --> 00:09:52,399
Kill her? What are you saying?

143
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:53,960
The first selection is in two days.

144
00:09:54,230 --> 00:09:55,629
He would never allow a woman near you,

145
00:09:55,630 --> 00:09:56,669
especially one...

146
00:09:56,670 --> 00:09:59,640
who resembles the late Crown Princess.

147
00:10:01,510 --> 00:10:03,840
Perhaps since you fell in the water...

148
00:10:04,740 --> 00:10:06,639
Have you become so foolish you cannot recall...

149
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:08,250
something so clear?

150
00:10:08,280 --> 00:10:10,750
No, it is not that...

151
00:10:11,450 --> 00:10:14,350
Your Highness, if this were you,

152
00:10:14,690 --> 00:10:16,790
you would have already struck me.

153
00:10:16,990 --> 00:10:18,090
"I am going to kill you."

154
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:20,990
You should be flying into a rage!

155
00:10:21,590 --> 00:10:23,360
Please, just hit me.

156
00:10:23,530 --> 00:10:25,530
- Just hit me! - Goodness!

157
00:10:26,260 --> 00:10:27,500
I do not want to!

158
00:10:29,700 --> 00:10:33,040
- Your Highness! - What is wrong?

159
00:10:36,740 --> 00:10:37,740
Your Highness.

160
00:10:53,290 --> 00:10:54,290
Grand Prince Je Un?

161
00:11:15,350 --> 00:11:17,480
Father, what brings you here?

162
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:21,750
So this greenhouse went to you.

163
00:11:22,290 --> 00:11:23,749
Did Grand Prince Je Un give it to you?

164
00:11:23,750 --> 00:11:25,690
I asked what brought you here.

165
00:11:28,660 --> 00:11:30,530
The first selection is in two days.

166
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:32,929
The late king gave this greenhouse to Queen Jangjeong...

167
00:11:32,930 --> 00:11:34,700
for her Royal Wedding.

168
00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:37,469
What will people say if a Crown Princess candidate...

169
00:11:37,470 --> 00:11:39,240
is seen coming and going to this greenhouse?

170
00:11:40,670 --> 00:11:42,610
Are you here to warn me to go along with the selection...

171
00:11:43,210 --> 00:11:44,910
without putting up a fight?

172
00:11:45,410 --> 00:11:47,310
And what if I refuse?

173
00:11:49,010 --> 00:11:50,680
The gun that shot the Crown Prince...

174
00:11:51,780 --> 00:11:54,790
- is still in my possession. - You already used that gun...

175
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:57,550
to ensure Grand Prince Je Un's safety.

176
00:11:58,060 --> 00:12:00,820
So if you use that gun to avoid entering the palace,

177
00:12:02,230 --> 00:12:05,000
are you saying you will abandon Grand Prince Je Un?

178
00:12:09,270 --> 00:12:10,630
With that one gun,

179
00:12:11,340 --> 00:12:14,640
did you think you could wrap me around your finger?

180
00:12:15,270 --> 00:12:16,340
No.

181
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:18,310
Do you really think, for even a moment,

182
00:12:18,940 --> 00:12:21,480
that you have ever had me under your thumb?

183
00:12:23,450 --> 00:12:26,050
I am tolerating you because I still have a use for you.

184
00:12:26,450 --> 00:12:28,790
I will put up with you.

185
00:12:29,420 --> 00:12:30,420
So you...

186
00:12:31,390 --> 00:12:33,290
will live your life in gratitude.

187
00:14:15,460 --> 00:14:17,260
My lord, where are you returning from?

188
00:14:17,730 --> 00:14:20,660
- Why? Is something wrong? - A letter arrived from Qing.

189
00:14:37,880 --> 00:14:39,020
Eun Woo.

190
00:14:40,050 --> 00:14:41,080
Yes?

191
00:14:42,090 --> 00:14:44,020
Yes, I am Cha Eun Woo.

192
00:14:44,690 --> 00:14:47,120
And you are? You seem much younger than me,

193
00:14:47,190 --> 00:14:50,760
- Why do you speak so casually? - You want me to speak formally?

194
00:14:53,900 --> 00:14:55,230
My apologies.

195
00:14:55,930 --> 00:14:59,340
His Highness spoke of you so often, I felt like we were already friends.

196
00:15:00,970 --> 00:15:01,970
The Crown Prince?

197
00:15:02,640 --> 00:15:04,070
You know His Highness?

198
00:15:04,340 --> 00:15:05,340
I do.

199
00:15:06,080 --> 00:15:07,210
Very well.

200
00:15:10,310 --> 00:15:11,550
Which brings me to my point.

201
00:15:12,250 --> 00:15:13,849
Take me with you to the Royal Office of Attire...

202
00:15:13,850 --> 00:15:15,890
- when you go there. - The Royal Office of Attire?

203
00:15:16,190 --> 00:15:18,090
Honestly, this woman...

204
00:15:18,520 --> 00:15:20,320
You think you can just waltz into the palace?

205
00:15:20,820 --> 00:15:23,290
You startled me! There is no need to shout.

206
00:15:23,460 --> 00:15:26,900
These are the ears that listen to the counsel of loyal subjects...

207
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:28,730
and the plight of the people.

208
00:15:28,870 --> 00:15:32,300
I stand corrected. In that case, you listen up.

209
00:15:34,040 --> 00:15:35,910
The way for you to enter the palace...

210
00:15:36,410 --> 00:15:38,010
- is nonexistent! - Hey!

211
00:15:38,040 --> 00:15:39,080
Get lost!

212
00:15:40,340 --> 00:15:44,150
"Get lost?" Did you just tell me to get lost?

213
00:15:46,550 --> 00:15:49,850
Do not do anything you will regret. I am warning you.

214
00:15:50,350 --> 00:15:52,060
I said, do not do anything you will regret.

215
00:15:53,490 --> 00:15:54,630
Darn it.

216
00:15:54,660 --> 00:15:55,929
Bother me again,

217
00:15:55,930 --> 00:15:57,460
and I will have you dragged to the Police Bureau!

218
00:15:57,530 --> 00:16:00,130
You got a death wish? You will regret this.

219
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:01,500
Mark my words!

220
00:16:02,430 --> 00:16:04,470
Hey! You louts!

221
00:16:04,870 --> 00:16:08,040
Be careful with that silk. It is for the palace!

222
00:16:08,170 --> 00:16:09,170
- Yes, sir. - Yes, sir.

223
00:16:15,150 --> 00:16:16,150
Right here.

224
00:16:32,930 --> 00:16:34,230
All right, let us see.

225
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:42,470
- What are you doing? Get down! - I am leaving.

226
00:16:43,710 --> 00:16:47,480
- Get down from there! Leave that! - I am not taking it.

227
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:53,820
You fools! What are you waiting for? Get her out of here!

228
00:16:54,220 --> 00:16:57,020
- I am leaving on my own. - What is all this commotion?

229
00:16:57,120 --> 00:16:58,920
Goodness, Head Merchant.

230
00:17:00,060 --> 00:17:01,060
Gang.

231
00:17:01,190 --> 00:17:04,090
The court ladies Queen Dowager keeps sending to your chambers.

232
00:17:04,130 --> 00:17:06,900
They all come from the Head Merchant.

233
00:17:10,770 --> 00:17:14,470
My goodness. How can the resemblance be so exact?

234
00:17:22,310 --> 00:17:23,380
Your Majesty.

235
00:17:23,550 --> 00:17:27,720
Perhaps now is the time to say what you must.

236
00:17:27,950 --> 00:17:28,990
You are right.

237
00:17:30,820 --> 00:17:31,860
You wretched girl.

238
00:17:32,220 --> 00:17:34,360
You tried to sneak into the palace, did you not?

239
00:17:34,490 --> 00:17:36,260
For that crime, I could...

240
00:17:36,630 --> 00:17:38,360
have you put to death right now!

241
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:42,030
And what crime would that be?

242
00:17:42,700 --> 00:17:43,700
What did you say?

243
00:17:43,730 --> 00:17:45,070
The attempt failed.

244
00:17:45,540 --> 00:17:48,270
As for proof that I tried to enter the palace,

245
00:17:48,670 --> 00:17:50,710
I only hid in a palace-bound cart.

246
00:17:50,740 --> 00:17:52,740
I can just say I did not know, right?

247
00:17:55,310 --> 00:17:57,050
You are not afraid of me, are you?

248
00:17:57,950 --> 00:17:59,180
I suppose I am used to it.

249
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:01,820
The nerve of this girl...

250
00:18:03,090 --> 00:18:04,120
You insolent girl!

251
00:18:04,650 --> 00:18:07,060
How dare you disrespect Her Majesty the Queen Dowager?

252
00:18:07,690 --> 00:18:09,689
Respectful or not,

253
00:18:09,690 --> 00:18:12,230
you will send me to the Crown Prince's quarters, right?

254
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:14,360
Because this face...

255
00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:18,740
is identical to that of the late Crown Princess.

256
00:18:20,370 --> 00:18:21,440
Did you tell her?

257
00:18:23,210 --> 00:18:24,510
I said no such thing.

258
00:18:24,670 --> 00:18:25,910
It is all so obvious.

259
00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:30,050
The Royal Secretary is exiled, and the bridal selection has begun.

260
00:18:30,280 --> 00:18:32,579
The Left State Councilor's daughter will be the next Crown Princess.

261
00:18:32,580 --> 00:18:34,850
And now that you have no allies in the palace,

262
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:39,120
you must see me as your last card to play, do you not?

263
00:18:39,160 --> 00:18:40,719
You think that with this face, I can catch the Crown Prince's eye,

264
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:42,290
become his concubine, and bear a royal grandson.

265
00:18:42,360 --> 00:18:44,190
A gamble you are willing to take.

266
00:18:45,130 --> 00:18:46,160
That is what you think, is it not?

267
00:18:49,670 --> 00:18:50,700
My goodness.

268
00:18:55,870 --> 00:18:58,310
Yes. You are correct.

269
00:18:59,610 --> 00:19:01,280
That is precisely how I intend to use you.

270
00:19:01,950 --> 00:19:03,450
You will steal the Crown Prince's heart...

271
00:19:03,980 --> 00:19:06,520
and conceive a royal heir. If you succeed,

272
00:19:07,050 --> 00:19:09,120
I will spare your life.

273
00:19:11,150 --> 00:19:13,120
As I have already told you,

274
00:19:14,490 --> 00:19:15,789
even if you turn me in to the police,

275
00:19:15,790 --> 00:19:17,290
my crime is not punishable by death.

276
00:19:18,430 --> 00:19:19,600
Do you really think that until now,

277
00:19:20,500 --> 00:19:22,900
I have only ever killed according to the law?

278
00:19:27,070 --> 00:19:30,540
Dal, once she was grown

279
00:19:31,040 --> 00:19:34,710
Lost her body

280
00:19:35,250 --> 00:19:38,820
From that wretched Crown Prince

281
00:19:39,380 --> 00:19:42,190
She received the divine punishment

282
00:19:43,490 --> 00:19:46,060
Shaba shaba

283
00:19:46,990 --> 00:19:49,090
Darn, shaba...

284
00:19:51,160 --> 00:19:54,660
Your Highness, why are you acting like this?

285
00:19:54,800 --> 00:19:56,669
You must eat.

286
00:19:56,670 --> 00:19:58,070
You will collapse again if you keep this up.

287
00:19:58,500 --> 00:20:00,740
Water flows from top to bottom, right?

288
00:20:02,070 --> 00:20:03,970
So food must be the same way, right?

289
00:20:10,410 --> 00:20:11,580
I cannot.

290
00:20:13,850 --> 00:20:14,950
Your Highness.

291
00:20:15,350 --> 00:20:17,490
The Left State Councilor is here.

292
00:20:20,420 --> 00:20:21,930
Who is it?

293
00:20:39,640 --> 00:20:42,850
Your Highness, I, Kim Han Chul, have come to pay my respects.

294
00:20:57,930 --> 00:20:59,660
This is just...

295
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:04,430
I have been lying down for so long, I feel a bit stiff.

296
00:21:08,070 --> 00:21:10,310
Here we go.

297
00:21:22,120 --> 00:21:23,120
Your Highness.

298
00:21:23,390 --> 00:21:26,690
- May I ask something of you? - What?

299
00:21:27,890 --> 00:21:29,830
Yes. Of course.

300
00:21:30,060 --> 00:21:33,000
It is about the girl you were searching for, Dal.

301
00:21:34,430 --> 00:21:35,430
Is it possible...

302
00:21:35,770 --> 00:21:40,500
that she is the peddler you saved the other day?

303
00:21:40,840 --> 00:21:41,840
What?

304
00:21:43,170 --> 00:21:45,240
No. That is not her.

305
00:21:46,040 --> 00:21:49,550
I was looking for her, but it is not what you think.

306
00:21:49,650 --> 00:21:53,320
There is absolutely nothing between me and that peddler.

307
00:21:53,680 --> 00:21:56,220
The only woman for me is your daughter.

308
00:21:57,990 --> 00:22:01,190
I certainly hope you mean that.

309
00:22:01,990 --> 00:22:04,430
Goodness. You do not have to worry.

310
00:22:05,100 --> 00:22:09,100
I will never be involved with her again. Absolutely never.

311
00:22:10,470 --> 00:22:13,400
This is the new eunuch who will serve you starting today.

312
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:25,780
My name is Lee Gang Dol.

313
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:27,080
Your Royal Highness.

314
00:22:30,090 --> 00:22:31,090
No way.

315
00:22:40,930 --> 00:22:43,670
Did the world turn upside down while I was not looking?

316
00:22:43,930 --> 00:22:46,040
Is there some new law that lets women be eunuchs now?

317
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:47,940
That is what makes me so special.

318
00:22:48,540 --> 00:22:51,270
I made the impossible possible, did I not?

319
00:22:51,510 --> 00:22:52,810
Do you think I am complimenting you?

320
00:22:53,740 --> 00:22:55,980
I am asking you what on earth is going on!

321
00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:02,090
Then, please let me enter the palace as a eunuch.

322
00:23:02,250 --> 00:23:05,720
A eunuch? If a woman is caught impersonating a eunuch,

323
00:23:05,890 --> 00:23:07,860
you could die. Do you not know that?

324
00:23:09,190 --> 00:23:11,230
If you get caught, I will be in trouble too.

325
00:23:11,460 --> 00:23:13,000
Even if I were to enter as a court lady,

326
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:14,800
the Chief Court Lady would fire me,

327
00:23:14,830 --> 00:23:17,100
and I would never even get close to the Crown Prince.

328
00:23:19,140 --> 00:23:21,600
If you are going to use me, then use me properly.

329
00:23:22,270 --> 00:23:25,740
I will be the ace up your sleeve.

330
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:38,090
There is no law in the whole world that allows this.

331
00:23:39,090 --> 00:23:41,120
There is absolutely no way this is allowed.

332
00:23:41,730 --> 00:23:43,490
If there is no law, you just make one.

333
00:23:44,160 --> 00:23:47,760
If that fails, you just break rules just to keep them on their toes.

334
00:23:47,960 --> 00:23:51,170
I am looking at the very picture of shameless audacity.

335
00:23:51,700 --> 00:23:54,500
If shameless audacity were a person, it would be you!

336
00:23:54,600 --> 00:23:56,740
What are you on about?

337
00:23:56,940 --> 00:23:59,210
Why steal my body and cause this mess?

338
00:23:59,240 --> 00:24:01,710
- This is all your fault! - What are you even talking about?

339
00:24:01,950 --> 00:24:03,279
If I had that kind of power,

340
00:24:03,280 --> 00:24:04,850
do you think I would still be a peddler?

341
00:24:05,920 --> 00:24:08,790
Hey, did you not have a red scar right here?

342
00:24:13,860 --> 00:24:14,890
What?

343
00:24:16,190 --> 00:24:18,700
Gosh, where did it go?

344
00:24:19,230 --> 00:24:20,500
The way I remember it, that day,

345
00:24:21,030 --> 00:24:22,830
a red light glowed from your wrist.

346
00:24:27,370 --> 00:24:28,370
Are you really...

347
00:24:29,510 --> 00:24:32,380
some kind of monster or an evil spirit?

348
00:24:33,810 --> 00:24:36,110
No, I am definitely not anything like that.

349
00:24:36,810 --> 00:24:38,480
But if this is the work of some strange spirit,

350
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:41,920
should we not perform an exorcism or go to a temple or something?

351
00:24:41,990 --> 00:24:43,390
Are you out of your mind?

352
00:24:43,750 --> 00:24:47,660
"The Crown Prince prays to shamans" or "The Crown Prince has gone mad."

353
00:24:47,720 --> 00:24:49,260
Trying to spread that rumor in the capital?

354
00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:51,590
We are already at the point of praying to rocks and the moon.

355
00:24:51,660 --> 00:24:53,360
So why can we not pray to a shaman or to Buddha?

356
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:56,000
Listen to me.

357
00:24:56,800 --> 00:24:59,040
The Crown Prince does not beg.

358
00:25:03,140 --> 00:25:04,209
- Then what? - Gosh, you scared me.

359
00:25:04,210 --> 00:25:06,640
What do you want us to do? What are you even saying?

360
00:25:08,010 --> 00:25:09,910
First, we need to get out of the palace.

361
00:25:12,380 --> 00:25:13,920
I have to get your confinement order lifted.

362
00:25:16,750 --> 00:25:17,790
Do you have a way to do that?

363
00:25:18,150 --> 00:25:19,220
The palace is, by nature,

364
00:25:20,560 --> 00:25:21,620
a world ruled by women.

365
00:25:23,990 --> 00:25:27,500
Lift the Crown Prince's confinement at once,

366
00:25:27,560 --> 00:25:29,330
Your Majesty!

367
00:25:39,180 --> 00:25:41,980
I asked you to get me out of the palace,

368
00:25:42,510 --> 00:25:44,150
not get me soaked in a bath.

369
00:25:44,910 --> 00:25:47,020
It was the Queen Dowager's condition.

370
00:25:47,580 --> 00:25:50,520
To lift the confinement, I had to attend your bath.

371
00:25:50,850 --> 00:25:54,160
She uses the same tricks every time. As if that would ever stir my heart.

372
00:25:54,220 --> 00:25:55,230
Goodness.

373
00:25:55,960 --> 00:26:00,830
So with a more "creative" method, could any woman sway your heart?

374
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:03,400
Go on then, tell me.

375
00:26:03,700 --> 00:26:06,600
What "creative" method does it take to make a man's heart waver?

376
00:26:06,870 --> 00:26:08,940
Why are you asking me? You are the one who swayed my heart.

377
00:26:18,920 --> 00:26:21,379
You did not just make my heart waver.

378
00:26:21,380 --> 00:26:23,290
You stole my body too, did you not?

379
00:26:23,490 --> 00:26:27,090
Oh, great. So now this is my fault too?

380
00:26:27,190 --> 00:26:28,220
Yes! It is your fault!

381
00:26:29,160 --> 00:26:31,830
So, have you thought of a way to switch us back?

382
00:26:31,900 --> 00:26:34,100
Why do you always ask me?

383
00:26:34,300 --> 00:26:37,829
Is your head just a hat rack? Why do you not use it?

384
00:26:37,830 --> 00:26:39,100
This brain of mine is pretty good.

385
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:43,170
Right. You have got a point.

386
00:26:43,740 --> 00:26:47,380
Remember, this was your idea, so do not get the wrong idea.

387
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:49,210
Beggars cannot be choosers.

388
00:26:49,850 --> 00:26:51,480
What is it? Just tell me.

389
00:26:53,050 --> 00:26:54,050
It is...

390
00:26:57,420 --> 00:26:59,790
How about we recreate what happened that day?

391
00:27:00,190 --> 00:27:01,190
That day?

392
00:27:01,990 --> 00:27:03,490
The day we fell into the water.

393
00:27:04,390 --> 00:27:07,530
My last memory from that moment was...

394
00:27:09,130 --> 00:27:10,200
My last memory?

395
00:27:24,980 --> 00:27:27,080
The kiss?

396
00:27:28,920 --> 00:27:31,890
Yes. That is it.

397
00:27:34,090 --> 00:27:38,260
I have no ulterior motives. Our bodies just switched that day,

398
00:27:38,290 --> 00:27:41,630
so it makes sense to redo that day. That is all I am saying.

399
00:27:41,660 --> 00:27:42,700
Do it.

400
00:27:43,500 --> 00:27:45,840
- Do it? - Yes, do it.

401
00:27:49,340 --> 00:27:50,340
Okay. Let us do it!

402
00:27:55,350 --> 00:27:58,410
Let me repeat, I have no other intentions, okay?

403
00:27:58,510 --> 00:28:00,720
Technically, this was your idea anyway.

404
00:28:00,780 --> 00:28:01,880
I get it, just hurry up.

405
00:28:10,490 --> 00:28:12,000
One, two.

406
00:28:26,610 --> 00:28:27,940
Why did it not work?

407
00:28:29,010 --> 00:28:30,380
I was so sure that would work.

408
00:28:38,250 --> 00:28:41,120
Just do it properly this time. No holding back.

409
00:28:42,130 --> 00:28:43,990
- Properly? - Yes.

410
00:28:45,860 --> 00:28:46,860
Fine.

411
00:30:52,590 --> 00:30:56,290
We will never get it to work if you come up for air so fast.

412
00:31:01,630 --> 00:31:02,630
Your Highness.

413
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:05,570
What gives you the right to kiss me underwater?

414
00:31:06,740 --> 00:31:07,740
I...

415
00:31:08,400 --> 00:31:12,380
You said to do it properly, so I was recreating that exact day.

416
00:31:18,110 --> 00:31:21,080
What is with him all of a sudden?

417
00:31:35,900 --> 00:31:36,900
Here.

418
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:40,670
I know you are mad I kissed you three times without asking,

419
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:43,140
but here, cover yourself with this.

420
00:31:43,610 --> 00:31:44,640
You will catch a cold.

421
00:31:59,060 --> 00:32:00,360
I am not angry.

422
00:32:02,430 --> 00:32:03,760
I was just a bit surprised, that is all.

423
00:32:12,130 --> 00:32:13,940
Who said you could be so reckless with my body?

424
00:32:17,470 --> 00:32:20,540
Let us go to my chambers. We still have things to discuss.

425
00:32:33,220 --> 00:32:34,390
Oh, my.

426
00:32:37,630 --> 00:32:40,900
Nothing sparks a fire between a man and a woman...

427
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:43,800
like a hot, confined space.

428
00:32:44,730 --> 00:32:48,440
Truly, when it comes to romance, the classics never fail.

429
00:32:48,740 --> 00:32:53,040
Where did this little godsend come from?

430
00:32:53,140 --> 00:32:56,850
Your reign will begin again, Your Majesty.

431
00:33:07,660 --> 00:33:09,990
Gosh. Oh, for crying out loud.

432
00:33:10,460 --> 00:33:12,800
Now what are we supposed to do?

433
00:33:13,060 --> 00:33:16,100
Gosh. A peck did not work, and a real kiss did not work.

434
00:33:17,100 --> 00:33:18,500
Doing it underwater did not work either.

435
00:33:19,670 --> 00:33:21,570
Why are you taking that out on me?

436
00:33:23,970 --> 00:33:27,610
I came up with one solution. Is it not your turn to find one?

437
00:33:29,650 --> 00:33:32,010
After all, this is all your fault.

438
00:33:32,680 --> 00:33:35,050
If you had not nearly drowned that day,

439
00:33:35,280 --> 00:33:37,620
or if you did not have that odd scar to begin with,

440
00:33:37,690 --> 00:33:39,320
something this bizarre and outrageous...

441
00:33:39,390 --> 00:33:40,460
would never have happened!

442
00:33:41,460 --> 00:33:42,460
That is right.

443
00:33:43,030 --> 00:33:44,030
The scar.

444
00:33:45,860 --> 00:33:46,960
The scar!

445
00:33:47,800 --> 00:33:48,800
What?

446
00:33:52,700 --> 00:33:54,940
That day, the scar on my wrist was glowing.

447
00:33:55,170 --> 00:33:56,470
We both fell in the water,

448
00:33:56,810 --> 00:33:58,270
then we kissed. That was the order, right?

449
00:33:59,640 --> 00:34:01,940
You have to end things the way they began.

450
00:34:02,580 --> 00:34:05,550
We have to do exactly what we did that day.

451
00:34:06,380 --> 00:34:07,380
Again?

452
00:34:08,120 --> 00:34:10,320
You want us to fall in the water?

453
00:34:10,390 --> 00:34:14,290
Hey. Do you have another solution? You want to keep living like this?

454
00:34:15,460 --> 00:34:16,590
We cannot live like this.

455
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:21,130
But...

456
00:34:21,430 --> 00:34:23,470
can we even get out to the bridge pier?

457
00:34:23,970 --> 00:34:27,740
The Left Flank Guard and Eunuch Yoon would not let me go.

458
00:34:29,540 --> 00:34:31,110
Then we need to find someone to help us.

459
00:34:37,980 --> 00:34:39,580
- Eun Woo. - Goodness.

460
00:34:39,780 --> 00:34:43,120
Oh, my. Your Highness.

461
00:34:43,450 --> 00:34:46,090
- Goodness, Your Highness. - Hey!

462
00:34:46,620 --> 00:34:47,620
Your Highness.

463
00:34:48,360 --> 00:34:50,930
Have you been well?

464
00:34:54,730 --> 00:34:58,500
- Get off me! What are you doing? - Where have I seen her before?

465
00:34:59,300 --> 00:35:02,440
- Why are you here? - See? Did I not tell you?

466
00:35:03,070 --> 00:35:05,670
I told you not to do anything you would regret. Right?

467
00:35:05,980 --> 00:35:09,350
He is the one! He threw me out and told me to get lost.

468
00:35:09,480 --> 00:35:12,050
- Eun Woo. - Yes? Yes? Oh, my.

469
00:35:13,980 --> 00:35:18,020
Eun Woo! You are the hope of Joseon!

470
00:35:18,250 --> 00:35:20,620
I am sorry? What?

471
00:35:25,330 --> 00:35:29,570
- Gosh! - Your Royal Highness!

472
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:31,900
What are you doing? Hurry, go after him.

473
00:35:33,740 --> 00:35:37,670
Hurry and follow him! You are going to lose him!

474
00:35:39,380 --> 00:35:41,710
Come out, quick. Hurry up. We do not have time.

475
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:44,280
Hurry, we have no time.

476
00:35:44,710 --> 00:35:45,950
Which way do we go? Where?

477
00:35:55,420 --> 00:35:56,430
Your Highness.

478
00:35:57,960 --> 00:36:00,660
- I am the only hope of Joseon... - Honestly.

479
00:36:05,800 --> 00:36:08,339
I am the only hope of Joseon.

480
00:36:08,340 --> 00:36:10,270
Hope, my butt. We are done for!

481
00:36:14,040 --> 00:36:15,040
All right.

482
00:36:16,050 --> 00:36:17,350
All right.

483
00:36:19,350 --> 00:36:21,750
Hurry up and stretch, you hear? We will be done if you get a cramp.

484
00:36:22,350 --> 00:36:23,690
Wait.

485
00:36:24,390 --> 00:36:26,320
If we pass out like we did last time,

486
00:36:26,660 --> 00:36:28,490
we will need someone there to pull us out.

487
00:36:29,090 --> 00:36:31,430
Shin Won and Se Dol should be here soon.

488
00:36:32,760 --> 00:36:35,529
Then why did we bother sneaking out?

489
00:36:35,530 --> 00:36:37,200
We should have just come with them.

490
00:36:38,300 --> 00:36:40,300
The Crown Prince nearly drowned.

491
00:36:40,600 --> 00:36:42,940
He wants to go back to the bridge pier to jump in again.

492
00:36:43,040 --> 00:36:46,940
If I had told them, would anyone have said, "Yes, Your Highness"?

493
00:36:47,040 --> 00:36:49,250
Or, "Allow me to clear the way for you"?

494
00:36:54,450 --> 00:36:57,020
I guess we will just have to wait then.

495
00:36:57,820 --> 00:37:01,460
- For goodness' sake. - What are you doing?

496
00:37:01,560 --> 00:37:02,760
Do not just sit anywhere. It is filthy.

497
00:37:02,830 --> 00:37:06,530
Gosh. This is how things get an unfair reputation. See?

498
00:37:06,760 --> 00:37:10,630
A king decides a fish is delicious and calls it a delicacy.

499
00:37:10,770 --> 00:37:14,670
Then it is just a common fish again. It is a sad life for the fish.

500
00:37:15,100 --> 00:37:16,570
Why are you suddenly talking about a fish?

501
00:37:17,040 --> 00:37:21,810
You are the one who slept outdoors while on the run for your life,

502
00:37:21,940 --> 00:37:24,310
but you are calling this very smooth bridge filthy?

503
00:37:24,380 --> 00:37:26,750
Now this bridge has been wronged, too. See?

504
00:37:28,050 --> 00:37:31,290
From now on, I will call you the Bridge of the Wronged. Okay?

505
00:37:31,350 --> 00:37:34,220
"Sniffle. So wronged."

506
00:37:35,320 --> 00:37:36,330
So wronged.

507
00:37:40,500 --> 00:37:42,360
All right, you are right.

508
00:37:47,240 --> 00:37:49,310
I am sorry, Bridge of the Wronged.

509
00:37:51,210 --> 00:37:52,240
Do not feel wronged anymore.

510
00:37:57,280 --> 00:37:58,280
Goodness.

511
00:38:01,580 --> 00:38:02,690
And as for you...

512
00:38:04,190 --> 00:38:06,190
- I am sorry. - What?

513
00:38:06,820 --> 00:38:07,860
So suddenly?

514
00:38:20,970 --> 00:38:22,470
You told me to say I was sorry.

515
00:38:23,770 --> 00:38:25,240
You told me to admit it was my fault.

516
00:38:27,780 --> 00:38:30,710
At a time like this, you should apologize.

517
00:38:31,980 --> 00:38:33,950
You should admit you were wrong.

518
00:38:35,420 --> 00:38:36,420
I am sorry.

519
00:38:37,720 --> 00:38:38,950
For saying you were low-born,

520
00:38:39,360 --> 00:38:42,220
and for being so cruel and careless about the hard life you have lived.

521
00:38:42,930 --> 00:38:43,930
For all of it.

522
00:38:49,500 --> 00:38:50,500
It is okay.

523
00:38:51,670 --> 00:38:52,870
You were not wrong, though.

524
00:38:56,140 --> 00:38:58,610
I just wanted to give you pretty clothes.

525
00:39:03,180 --> 00:39:05,480
I wanted to give you all sorts of beautiful things.

526
00:39:07,120 --> 00:39:10,990
I never saw you as a replacement for the Crown Princess,

527
00:39:11,620 --> 00:39:15,260
or as some kind of doll. Never.

528
00:39:17,690 --> 00:39:19,030
In fact, because of you...

529
00:39:25,100 --> 00:39:26,200
Because of you,

530
00:39:33,280 --> 00:39:35,540
there were days I did not even think about the Crown Princess.

531
00:39:36,980 --> 00:39:39,050
What? What are you blaming me for now?

532
00:39:41,380 --> 00:39:42,720
It is because of you.

533
00:39:44,420 --> 00:39:45,620
I knew it.

534
00:39:48,790 --> 00:39:50,330
If it were not for you...

535
00:39:51,530 --> 00:39:53,399
I would not have stopped the mat-rolling punishment...

536
00:39:53,400 --> 00:39:54,430
like a madman...

537
00:39:54,860 --> 00:39:57,430
or held a knife to the Minister of Personnel's throat.

538
00:39:58,730 --> 00:40:01,940
But because it is you, I am finding...

539
00:40:02,670 --> 00:40:04,270
that I do not mind this divine punishment.

540
00:40:20,290 --> 00:40:23,160
- Your Highness! - Your Highness!

541
00:40:23,890 --> 00:40:25,930
- Your... - Your Highness!

542
00:40:27,630 --> 00:40:30,030
Looks like they are here. Get ready quickly, okay?

543
00:40:30,470 --> 00:40:31,470
Okay?

544
00:40:32,600 --> 00:40:36,170
Okay, on the count of three, we jump.

545
00:40:40,940 --> 00:40:41,940
One,

546
00:40:42,540 --> 00:40:43,550
two,

547
00:40:44,410 --> 00:40:45,410
three!

548
00:40:47,450 --> 00:40:51,050
- I cannot. - What? What are you talking about?

549
00:41:13,080 --> 00:41:15,240
He must be scared.

550
00:41:23,050 --> 00:41:26,160
- Why? - Just close your eyes tight.

551
00:41:26,790 --> 00:41:28,120
Do not worry, I am a great swimmer.

552
00:41:28,990 --> 00:41:31,730
I will protect you this time too.

553
00:41:34,930 --> 00:41:35,930
- Your Highness! - Your Highness!

554
00:41:35,930 --> 00:41:36,930
What do we do?

555
00:41:39,170 --> 00:41:40,170
Your Highness!

556
00:42:20,410 --> 00:42:22,910
What are we going to do now?

557
00:42:25,110 --> 00:42:26,780
Do not cry with my face.

558
00:42:27,450 --> 00:42:30,850
Would I not look like a lunatic if I started laughing right now?

559
00:42:32,790 --> 00:42:34,660
And watch your language.

560
00:42:44,600 --> 00:42:47,670
Your attire must also be proper.

561
00:42:48,770 --> 00:42:52,980
Hey, why are you getting so formal all of a sudden?

562
00:42:53,980 --> 00:42:57,750
From now on, you have to truly become...

563
00:42:59,380 --> 00:43:00,680
Lee Gang, the Crown Prince of Joseon.

564
00:43:02,320 --> 00:43:06,050
Your Highness, I have prepared your new royal robes.

565
00:43:06,560 --> 00:43:08,020
Do not shy away from luxury.

566
00:43:08,720 --> 00:43:10,560
The red lining matches Your Highness's personal color,

567
00:43:10,630 --> 00:43:14,530
which we have determined is the "Summer Ice" color type.

568
00:43:14,600 --> 00:43:16,230
Personal color, my butt!

569
00:43:16,430 --> 00:43:20,100
My people are poor and have to wear hemp clothes in the dead of winter.

570
00:43:20,300 --> 00:43:22,969
They cannot wash or eat, so sunburnt they cannot tell...

571
00:43:22,970 --> 00:43:24,340
their own skin tone,

572
00:43:24,410 --> 00:43:26,340
so why are we wasting money on the darn lining?

573
00:43:27,010 --> 00:43:30,850
Coastal villages cannot catch fish because of the rough seas,

574
00:43:31,110 --> 00:43:34,550
and the rice paddies have dried up and turned yellow from the drought.

575
00:43:34,980 --> 00:43:39,120
This meal does not reflect reality of the country at all, does it?

576
00:43:39,520 --> 00:43:44,160
- Your Highness, what do you mean? - Ignoring your people's suffering.

577
00:43:44,230 --> 00:43:48,460
The reason we serve local specialties on the royal table...

578
00:43:48,530 --> 00:43:51,370
is to stay informed of conditions in those regions.

579
00:43:51,430 --> 00:43:56,040
But from this table, you would think the country is a field of flowers.

580
00:43:56,540 --> 00:43:58,540
This is basically propaganda.

581
00:44:03,550 --> 00:44:05,950
Hey! Can you not do something about that accent?

582
00:44:06,080 --> 00:44:07,220
You speak the capital dialect well.

583
00:44:07,420 --> 00:44:11,820
Is the Crown Prince dissing people with regional accents right now?

584
00:44:11,890 --> 00:44:13,160
It is not that I am dissing them.

585
00:44:13,790 --> 00:44:16,630
But if I, a capital native, suddenly speak with an accent,

586
00:44:16,690 --> 00:44:17,960
would people not get suspicious?

587
00:44:20,130 --> 00:44:22,630
But there is something I have been wondering.

588
00:44:23,370 --> 00:44:25,730
Why are we hiding the fact that we have switched bodies?

589
00:44:26,340 --> 00:44:30,210
Should we not tell everyone we have switched bodies so that...

590
00:44:30,270 --> 00:44:32,309
it would be much easier to find a way...

591
00:44:32,310 --> 00:44:33,440
to switch back with everyone's help.

592
00:44:33,780 --> 00:44:35,810
What you want to go around telling everyone...

593
00:44:35,880 --> 00:44:39,850
is that the Crown Prince has gone mad? Is that it?

594
00:44:41,120 --> 00:44:45,120
"Everyone, I have switched bodies overnight with a peddler woman."

595
00:44:45,190 --> 00:44:49,390
"What should I do?" Do you think any minister will go, "Is that so?"

596
00:44:49,560 --> 00:44:54,030
Then say, "We will form a plan." You really think they would do that?

597
00:44:55,060 --> 00:44:58,170
Why keep using that brilliant mind of mine like this?

598
00:44:58,970 --> 00:44:59,970
Okay, I get it.

599
00:45:03,370 --> 00:45:06,270
- I get it. - That is better.

600
00:45:07,010 --> 00:45:08,480
To recap,

601
00:45:09,080 --> 00:45:11,750
be extravagant, ignore the people's welfare,

602
00:45:11,810 --> 00:45:14,780
use the capital's accent, and keep it a secret.

603
00:45:15,250 --> 00:45:16,420
That is everything, right?

604
00:45:17,020 --> 00:45:19,390
- Is that it? - We are not done yet.

605
00:45:21,190 --> 00:45:22,519
Pretend you do not know anything.

606
00:45:22,520 --> 00:45:24,659
"Things have root and branch."

607
00:45:24,660 --> 00:45:25,860
"Affairs have an end and a beginning."

608
00:45:26,160 --> 00:45:28,760
"To know what comes first and last is to be near the way."

609
00:45:28,930 --> 00:45:32,470
Gosh, since these men feast on dust instead of rice,

610
00:45:32,700 --> 00:45:34,270
it is no wonder all they talk is stale nonsense.

611
00:45:36,070 --> 00:45:37,240
Enough of this.

612
00:45:37,540 --> 00:45:40,480
Does anyone here know the price of rice or salt?

613
00:45:42,580 --> 00:45:45,880
Your Highness, why concern yourself with such trivial matters?

614
00:45:46,780 --> 00:45:49,020
Ancient sages spoke of governing to bring peace to the world.

615
00:45:49,250 --> 00:45:53,060
Your Highness should look forward and cultivate a ruler's virtues.

616
00:45:53,820 --> 00:45:55,460
Gosh, Judas Priest.

617
00:45:57,560 --> 00:46:01,130
- Did he just... - Pardon?

618
00:46:01,200 --> 00:46:04,170
I said, "Justice and Duty."

619
00:46:04,230 --> 00:46:06,740
"Principle and Esteem."

620
00:46:07,940 --> 00:46:10,870
Those are the virtues I will realize through the Great Learning.

621
00:46:12,010 --> 00:46:14,540
Compared to books for the nobility, the people's plight...

622
00:46:14,610 --> 00:46:17,550
is always met with a "Who cares?"

623
00:46:17,610 --> 00:46:21,480
And the people are the only ones who get ruined.

624
00:46:21,550 --> 00:46:23,790
However, I will simply "suck it up"...

625
00:46:23,850 --> 00:46:26,590
and, as my teachers taught me, get back to my studies.

626
00:46:26,660 --> 00:46:28,620
(To absorb knowledge through diligent study)

627
00:46:29,190 --> 00:46:31,630
And be cold to everyone.

628
00:46:45,740 --> 00:46:47,240
This morning greeting is unexpected.

629
00:46:48,210 --> 00:46:51,680
Is it not a son's duty to ensure his father is well?

630
00:46:53,120 --> 00:46:55,350
But why are you playing Go by yourself?

631
00:46:57,120 --> 00:46:58,220
Would you like a partner?

632
00:47:02,890 --> 00:47:05,130
The Crown Prince seems odd lately, do you not think?

633
00:47:05,430 --> 00:47:08,930
It started with the eunuch who looks just like the late Crown Princess.

634
00:47:09,060 --> 00:47:12,269
Be quiet. He even bathes with the eunuch...

635
00:47:12,270 --> 00:47:13,900
because he cannot get over her.

636
00:47:14,040 --> 00:47:17,840
- With a look-alike eunuch? - That is it. That is totally it.

637
00:47:17,910 --> 00:47:19,010
You are right.

638
00:47:20,480 --> 00:47:23,350
What has gotten into you, being so affectionate so suddenly?

639
00:47:23,510 --> 00:47:26,720
A son must naturally show respect to his father.

640
00:47:29,750 --> 00:47:31,690
Here, should I place my stone here?

641
00:47:32,890 --> 00:47:34,490
Consider your move carefully.

642
00:47:35,260 --> 00:47:38,090
- It is a picnic ko. - What is a picnic ko?

643
00:47:39,290 --> 00:47:41,830
One side has nothing to lose,

644
00:47:42,030 --> 00:47:44,300
but the other side must win...

645
00:47:44,970 --> 00:47:47,440
to avoid a major loss. That is the situation.

646
00:47:53,180 --> 00:47:56,040
I almost lost the game with that one move.

647
00:47:59,680 --> 00:48:01,580
It is said the world is but a single Go board.

648
00:48:03,320 --> 00:48:06,050
Human affairs are just one long game of Go.

649
00:48:08,490 --> 00:48:11,060
The Left State Councilor's daughter was chosen today, was she not?

650
00:48:11,790 --> 00:48:15,400
From now on, you cannot make a single mistake in any move.

651
00:48:42,320 --> 00:48:44,560
You are finally the Crown Princess.

652
00:48:45,230 --> 00:48:47,499
You are the master of this quarters.

653
00:48:47,500 --> 00:48:49,760
Do not pay any mind to the rumors around the palace.

654
00:48:50,330 --> 00:48:54,140
You did not think saying that would make me think of them more,

655
00:48:54,300 --> 00:48:55,340
did you?

656
00:48:55,570 --> 00:48:58,910
In any case, Your Highness.

657
00:49:02,710 --> 00:49:04,680
From now on, do not worry about anything else,

658
00:49:05,280 --> 00:49:08,550
and please live a long and happy life with the Crown Prince.

659
00:49:08,850 --> 00:49:10,950
- All right? - Yeo Ri.

660
00:49:11,890 --> 00:49:12,890
Did you know?

661
00:49:13,790 --> 00:49:15,490
Until the royal wedding is held,

662
00:49:15,560 --> 00:49:17,030
a woman is not the Crown Prince's yet,

663
00:49:17,830 --> 00:49:19,460
even if she has been chosen.

664
00:49:19,930 --> 00:49:22,700
What do you mean?

665
00:49:30,940 --> 00:49:32,570
Have you been well?

666
00:49:35,710 --> 00:49:37,650
I have not been doing so well myself.

667
00:49:38,880 --> 00:49:40,380
But you, my lord,

668
00:49:41,750 --> 00:49:43,690
will remain handsome forever, will you not?

669
00:49:47,360 --> 00:49:52,059
(Memorial tablet of the beloved Kang Han Seong)

670
00:49:52,060 --> 00:49:55,230
My lord!

671
00:49:56,330 --> 00:49:58,069
What is going on?

672
00:49:58,070 --> 00:50:00,970
Assassinating the Queen? Treason?

673
00:50:01,070 --> 00:50:02,239
Do not cry.

674
00:50:02,240 --> 00:50:03,369
(Kang Han Seong, Yeon Wol's brother)

675
00:50:03,370 --> 00:50:05,710
- You will ruin your beautiful face. - My lord...

676
00:50:07,840 --> 00:50:09,640
Can I ask you for a favor?

677
00:50:10,580 --> 00:50:12,680
- A favor? - I know it is a lot to ask,

678
00:50:14,520 --> 00:50:16,350
but please take care of the Crown Princess.

679
00:50:17,190 --> 00:50:18,920
When my father and I are gone...

680
00:50:19,390 --> 00:50:23,930
I cannot bear the thought of my dear sister all alone.

681
00:50:25,290 --> 00:50:26,630
No matter what happens,

682
00:50:27,660 --> 00:50:30,100
I will protect the Crown Princess, my lord.

683
00:50:35,340 --> 00:50:38,010
I am sorry it has taken me so long to say this.

684
00:50:40,210 --> 00:50:41,240
That I...

685
00:50:43,410 --> 00:50:45,450
hoped you would be my one and only.

686
00:50:47,850 --> 00:50:48,880
My...

687
00:50:50,620 --> 00:50:51,650
Hong Nan.

688
00:50:54,420 --> 00:50:55,420
My lord...

689
00:50:59,330 --> 00:51:00,330
My lord...

690
00:51:05,700 --> 00:51:07,370
Do not worry, my lord.

691
00:51:09,140 --> 00:51:10,370
The Crown Princess.

692
00:51:11,670 --> 00:51:14,110
I will protect her with my life.

693
00:51:16,280 --> 00:51:17,280
That...

694
00:51:17,980 --> 00:51:20,920
is the only reason I chose to live...

695
00:51:22,620 --> 00:51:24,320
instead of following you.

696
00:51:32,660 --> 00:51:34,560
We eunuchs, who protect the royals, must, in an emergency,

697
00:51:34,630 --> 00:51:36,600
carry His Majesty and our superiors on our backs and run.

698
00:51:37,070 --> 00:51:39,669
That is why maintaining our physical strength is essential.

699
00:51:39,670 --> 00:51:42,770
All of you, carry a sack of flour and run ten laps.

700
00:51:43,100 --> 00:51:45,770
If your sack bursts and spills, you get three extra laps.

701
00:51:45,970 --> 00:51:47,240
- Yes, sir. - Yes, sir.

702
00:51:47,780 --> 00:51:50,480
(Eunuch Physical Fitness Test)

703
00:52:00,990 --> 00:52:02,820
Even rice sacks tear easily.

704
00:52:03,360 --> 00:52:05,160
But flour sacks? Darn it.

705
00:52:06,590 --> 00:52:07,900
Then complain to His Royal Highness.

706
00:52:09,130 --> 00:52:10,600
What does His Highness have to do with this?

707
00:52:12,800 --> 00:52:13,800
Hello?

708
00:52:14,900 --> 00:52:17,239
Well, now, look at that.

709
00:52:17,240 --> 00:52:18,770
I do not know which palace he serves,

710
00:52:18,840 --> 00:52:20,310
but that eunuch's master's head just burst.

711
00:52:20,380 --> 00:52:23,650
What? What an outrageous thing to say.

712
00:52:23,810 --> 00:52:27,750
Just because it is hard, they would drop the King or master?

713
00:52:28,120 --> 00:52:30,419
Hey! Change those to flour sacks.

714
00:52:30,420 --> 00:52:32,820
And add three laps every time a sack leaks.

715
00:52:32,950 --> 00:52:36,290
Darn it. I should have become a court lady.

716
00:52:42,060 --> 00:52:44,570
First place.

717
00:52:46,530 --> 00:52:47,540
So hot.

718
00:52:47,900 --> 00:52:50,940
- First place! - Gosh, what is his problem?

719
00:53:00,550 --> 00:53:03,920
I should have just become a court lady.

720
00:53:16,930 --> 00:53:17,970
Hey, you.

721
00:53:26,510 --> 00:53:29,740
You there. Which department are you with?

722
00:53:32,080 --> 00:53:33,150
Let me see your face.

723
00:54:06,650 --> 00:54:08,220
Hey, newbie!

724
00:54:08,550 --> 00:54:12,220
You little punk! I told you to clean up that flour.

725
00:54:12,290 --> 00:54:13,320
How dare you try to run off?

726
00:54:13,760 --> 00:54:17,490
Did you think I would not find you just because you were hiding?

727
00:54:19,730 --> 00:54:21,460
My lord, my apologies.

728
00:54:22,230 --> 00:54:25,570
But did you have business with our rookie?

729
00:54:26,370 --> 00:54:27,970
- Not at all. - I see.

730
00:54:28,340 --> 00:54:31,510
He can be a bit of a slacker,

731
00:54:31,610 --> 00:54:33,410
but he is definitely not a suspicious person.

732
00:54:34,980 --> 00:54:35,980
Why are you standing there?

733
00:54:36,480 --> 00:54:39,380
Go and clean up that flour! Hurry!

734
00:54:41,780 --> 00:54:43,050
- Yes, sir. - Right.

735
00:54:47,360 --> 00:54:49,960
My lord, you have some flour on your beard...

736
00:54:50,020 --> 00:54:51,730
What do you think you are doing?

737
00:55:01,340 --> 00:55:02,840
Take care, my lord.

738
00:55:09,540 --> 00:55:10,650
Goodness.

739
00:55:11,550 --> 00:55:15,180
That was the greatest achievement of my 19 years.

740
00:55:25,790 --> 00:55:27,500
You there. Are you not Dal?

741
00:55:27,860 --> 00:55:30,030
- Who is it now? - It is me, Master Heo.

742
00:55:30,570 --> 00:55:32,300
What, you do not recognize me in my official robes?

743
00:55:32,800 --> 00:55:35,500
Fancy meeting my daughter's savior here.

744
00:55:36,300 --> 00:55:39,070
So this is why I could not find you. I waited for days in Boryeong.

745
00:55:39,940 --> 00:55:41,880
Your daughter's savior...

746
00:55:43,510 --> 00:55:44,950
Are you Inspector Kim's father-in-law?

747
00:55:45,350 --> 00:55:47,580
Gosh, do not even mention that scum.

748
00:55:47,850 --> 00:55:50,590
Seriously, what were you thinking?

749
00:55:50,850 --> 00:55:53,660
She is a fragile kid who is not even supposed to be in Hanyang,

750
00:55:53,920 --> 00:55:55,690
and you ordered her to kidnap your widowed daughter?

751
00:55:57,090 --> 00:56:00,230
Says the one who should not be in Hanyang.

752
00:56:00,360 --> 00:56:02,560
You are not even a court lady.

753
00:56:02,900 --> 00:56:04,330
So, have you become a eunuch?

754
00:56:04,770 --> 00:56:07,100
That is just how it worked out.

755
00:56:09,170 --> 00:56:13,940
Did that lowly inspector really try to kill a high official's daughter?

756
00:56:15,440 --> 00:56:17,250
I cannot believe the Kim clan is that powerful.

757
00:56:17,980 --> 00:56:20,010
You even know the officials' ranks too?

758
00:56:24,690 --> 00:56:27,390
If he is Lord Heo, a high-ranking military official in Boryeong,

759
00:56:27,960 --> 00:56:30,120
then he must be Lord Heo Ok, the former Naval Commander.

760
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:44,710
Your Highness!

761
00:56:45,370 --> 00:56:47,740
- You are hurting my ears. - You must listen to me now!

762
00:56:48,440 --> 00:56:49,940
That peddler.

763
00:56:50,950 --> 00:56:52,750
The woman who came to Sinjusa.

764
00:56:53,680 --> 00:56:55,350
She is a eunuch now.

765
00:56:56,720 --> 00:56:57,820
Where is she?

766
00:57:02,420 --> 00:57:03,760
It is not poisoned. You can drink it.

767
00:57:05,830 --> 00:57:08,630
Why did you bring me here instead of reporting me to the Eunuch Office?

768
00:57:11,270 --> 00:57:12,630
You must be scared.

769
00:57:13,130 --> 00:57:17,340
I suppose if it were discovered that a woman posed as a eunuch,

770
00:57:18,240 --> 00:57:20,240
you could be put to death.

771
00:57:21,010 --> 00:57:22,010
Do not worry.

772
00:57:22,540 --> 00:57:24,610
I will not report you.

773
00:57:25,150 --> 00:57:26,180
For now.

774
00:57:30,220 --> 00:57:31,450
What do you want?

775
00:57:32,650 --> 00:57:35,090
I plan to fight against my father.

776
00:57:35,760 --> 00:57:38,590
My father is using the Crown Prince to control the King,

777
00:57:39,160 --> 00:57:41,660
and I will use you to control the Crown Prince.

778
00:57:42,400 --> 00:57:43,460
And like that, I...

779
00:57:44,700 --> 00:57:46,800
will take Joseon for myself.

780
00:57:48,400 --> 00:57:50,670
She is going to use Dal as my weakness.

781
00:57:52,410 --> 00:57:53,980
Spoken like the Left State Councilor's daughter.

782
00:57:54,980 --> 00:57:59,150
Gosh, how many people are holding my life for ransom now?

783
00:57:59,510 --> 00:58:01,220
My goodness!

784
00:58:01,720 --> 00:58:04,450
I help out one person, and this is what I get?

785
00:58:05,350 --> 00:58:07,050
There is a limit to repaying a favor with betrayal.

786
00:58:07,620 --> 00:58:10,830
I saved his life, and now my own is being held for ransom,

787
00:58:10,890 --> 00:58:13,330
while he gets to sleep soundly and orders me to make his bed.

788
00:58:13,390 --> 00:58:16,060
- Goodness. - "He"? Did you say "he"?

789
00:58:16,460 --> 00:58:17,900
Did you just refer to me disrespectfully?

790
00:58:18,170 --> 00:58:20,130
When we are all about to die, what can I not say?

791
00:58:20,670 --> 00:58:22,100
Do not worry.

792
00:58:23,300 --> 00:58:25,270
You will be staying in my quarters for the time being.

793
00:58:25,670 --> 00:58:27,740
As long as you are here, the Crown Princess cannot touch you.

794
00:58:27,940 --> 00:58:28,940
What?

795
00:58:29,240 --> 00:58:31,780
- You do not care what others say? - Have you forgotten?

796
00:58:32,080 --> 00:58:33,550
To everyone else, you are a man.

797
00:58:34,320 --> 00:58:37,750
A Crown Prince studying all night, with his eunuch grinding the ink.

798
00:58:37,820 --> 00:58:39,120
Is there anything strange about that?

799
00:58:39,220 --> 00:58:41,760
Just because other people see a man, does that make me one?

800
00:58:42,020 --> 00:58:43,960
How are we supposed to share a room?

801
00:59:04,710 --> 00:59:06,310
I think I know...

802
00:59:06,850 --> 00:59:08,250
what you were expecting,

803
00:59:08,920 --> 00:59:10,220
but I am sorry, all right?

804
00:59:10,920 --> 00:59:14,560
I have too much royal work to do to be sharing a bed with you.

805
00:59:15,360 --> 00:59:17,660
What? I was not expecting anything.

806
00:59:18,230 --> 00:59:22,700
I was just thinking what a relief that is.

807
01:00:22,720 --> 01:00:25,390
That is why I killed Her Majesty, the Queen,

808
01:00:25,690 --> 01:00:28,100
and framed the former Crown Princess for the crime.

809
01:00:29,160 --> 01:00:30,199
That is why...

810
01:00:30,200 --> 01:00:33,870
you chose death instead of getting revenge.

811
01:00:34,500 --> 01:00:35,870
How pathetic.

812
01:01:21,250 --> 01:01:22,620
Were you having a nightmare?

813
01:01:24,790 --> 01:01:26,620
My heart...

814
01:01:27,490 --> 01:01:29,660
My heart aches.

815
01:01:30,420 --> 01:01:31,830
It is like I am underwater.

816
01:01:32,490 --> 01:01:34,130
I feel like I am suffocating.

817
01:01:57,120 --> 01:01:58,120
It is okay.

818
01:02:04,490 --> 01:02:06,460
Why are we out for a walk this late?

819
01:02:07,060 --> 01:02:09,700
If you lie down now, you will have that nightmare again.

820
01:02:10,400 --> 01:02:12,500
Walking for a bit should help.

821
01:02:13,070 --> 01:02:14,600
Do you have nightmares often?

822
01:02:15,540 --> 01:02:16,540
Pretty often.

823
01:02:18,110 --> 01:02:19,670
It must be your nightmares, Your Highness.

824
01:02:21,180 --> 01:02:22,810
Actually, ever since we switched bodies,

825
01:02:23,540 --> 01:02:25,180
I have been having dreams almost every night.

826
01:02:27,180 --> 01:02:28,950
Dreams about the Crown Princess.

827
01:02:30,080 --> 01:02:33,250
But they do not feel like just dreams.

828
01:02:33,790 --> 01:02:36,120
I think they are your memories.

829
01:02:39,560 --> 01:02:40,900
As if taking my body was not enough,

830
01:02:42,400 --> 01:02:44,530
now you have taken my nightmares too.

831
01:02:44,930 --> 01:02:47,070
Are you blaming me for taking your nightmares?

832
01:02:49,400 --> 01:02:50,640
Those nightmares...

833
01:02:54,340 --> 01:02:56,640
were the only way I could still see her.

834
01:02:57,780 --> 01:03:00,010
But ever since we switched bodies,

835
01:03:00,350 --> 01:03:02,480
I have not been able to have even those nightmares.

836
01:03:04,590 --> 01:03:05,650
I just realized that now.

837
01:03:14,260 --> 01:03:15,800
It is probably because you are in my body.

838
01:03:16,630 --> 01:03:18,800
I fall asleep the second my head hits the pillow.

839
01:03:20,430 --> 01:03:21,840
There is nothing for me to remember, anyway.

840
01:03:22,340 --> 01:03:23,700
Nothing to remember?

841
01:03:25,040 --> 01:03:26,570
The thing is...

842
01:03:27,940 --> 01:03:30,510
My parents... They are not my birth parents.

843
01:03:32,480 --> 01:03:36,720
When I was five, I lost my parents while running from slave hunters.

844
01:03:36,780 --> 01:03:40,190
I was left an orphan, all alone. My aunt was the one who took me in.

845
01:03:41,120 --> 01:03:43,290
Oh, my. What?

846
01:03:45,590 --> 01:03:49,760
- You never told me any of this. - At the time,

847
01:03:50,030 --> 01:03:54,570
I never thought we would be so tangled up like this.

848
01:03:57,540 --> 01:03:59,440
Besides, this palace...

849
01:03:59,510 --> 01:04:02,580
is a vicious place, you know?

850
01:04:02,880 --> 01:04:07,720
My parents and my aunt's only crime was raising a poor orphan.

851
01:04:08,080 --> 01:04:12,290
What if the Left State Councilor or the Queen Grand Dowager...

852
01:04:12,320 --> 01:04:14,260
end up hurting my parents because of me?

853
01:04:24,430 --> 01:04:26,070
You must have been so cold.

854
01:04:29,100 --> 01:04:30,970
It was like a winter night.

855
01:04:31,840 --> 01:04:32,840
A winter's night?

856
01:04:34,710 --> 01:04:38,480
They say I was chased by slavers when I lost my memories.

857
01:04:40,850 --> 01:04:42,350
When I opened my eyes,

858
01:04:43,320 --> 01:04:45,050
my mind was completely blank,

859
01:04:46,050 --> 01:04:47,720
but my memory was just a black void.

860
01:04:48,460 --> 01:04:50,360
When I came to and went outside,

861
01:04:50,960 --> 01:04:53,990
the sky was also pitch-black,

862
01:04:55,300 --> 01:04:58,630
and the deep snow I was sinking into was stark white.

863
01:04:59,800 --> 01:05:02,000
As I walked aimlessly,

864
01:05:02,500 --> 01:05:03,540
I thought to myself, "Perhaps..."

865
01:05:04,870 --> 01:05:07,170
"this can be my first memory."

866
01:05:11,310 --> 01:05:12,310
"Then..."

867
01:05:12,880 --> 01:05:14,720
"are these my first steps?"

868
01:05:17,420 --> 01:05:20,850
"In that case, today will be my birthday."

869
01:05:21,620 --> 01:05:24,060
"From now on, my season will be the winter night."

870
01:05:24,690 --> 01:05:25,690
That is what I decided.

871
01:05:27,230 --> 01:05:28,230
How can you be so calm?

872
01:05:29,400 --> 01:05:30,530
After everything you went through.

873
01:05:30,700 --> 01:05:32,130
What other choice do I have?

874
01:05:32,300 --> 01:05:33,470
I do not have any good memories.

875
01:05:33,530 --> 01:05:35,340
It only hurts me to dwell on the bad ones.

876
01:05:36,070 --> 01:05:39,310
And it is my loss if I just cower and blame my awful fate.

877
01:05:40,540 --> 01:05:42,040
What is awful about your fate?

878
01:05:42,610 --> 01:05:46,450
- You are incredibly lucky. - I would not say I am that lucky.

879
01:05:48,950 --> 01:05:50,650
No, you are very lucky.

880
01:05:50,990 --> 01:05:54,890
To be so fatefully entangled with the Crown Prince.

881
01:05:55,690 --> 01:05:56,820
So tell me.

882
01:05:57,490 --> 01:06:00,790
Your dreams, your wishes, anything.

883
01:06:02,500 --> 01:06:04,470
"Dream" is too grand a word for it.

884
01:06:09,470 --> 01:06:10,770
Other than straw shoes,

885
01:06:12,470 --> 01:06:13,810
I want one in silk shoes.

886
01:06:17,280 --> 01:06:20,110
Silk shoes? I will buy you over a hundred pairs of them.

887
01:06:20,280 --> 01:06:23,180
I will buy you enough to fill an entire room.

888
01:06:24,250 --> 01:06:26,950
No, the "silk shoes"...

889
01:06:27,620 --> 01:06:29,460
It is a metaphor.

890
01:06:32,230 --> 01:06:33,230
Forget it.

891
01:06:36,930 --> 01:06:40,330
There are two things that really annoy people.

892
01:06:40,530 --> 01:06:43,240
One is when someone stops talking mid-sentence,

893
01:06:43,740 --> 01:06:44,910
and the other is...

894
01:06:50,280 --> 01:06:51,380
And the other is?

895
01:06:53,810 --> 01:06:56,020
- What is it? - See?

896
01:06:56,450 --> 01:06:59,650
Now you know how curious I am to hear what you were saying.

897
01:07:00,720 --> 01:07:01,820
Gosh.

898
01:07:04,090 --> 01:07:07,830
Not a life of constant wandering,

899
01:07:09,130 --> 01:07:10,960
wearing out your straw shoes.

900
01:07:12,930 --> 01:07:14,130
But a life where I wear silk shoes...

901
01:07:15,300 --> 01:07:16,700
and walk at a leisurely pace.

902
01:07:18,240 --> 01:07:19,240
That is the life I want.

903
01:07:21,440 --> 01:07:23,180
Where I do not have to run anymore,

904
01:07:24,780 --> 01:07:26,450
and I do not have to live in hiding.

905
01:07:27,180 --> 01:07:28,420
A life where I can settle down...

906
01:07:29,820 --> 01:07:31,450
and make a real family of my own.

907
01:07:37,560 --> 01:07:38,560
What is it?

908
01:07:40,260 --> 01:07:43,300
It may sound as foolish as a fish trying to swallow the moon,

909
01:07:43,600 --> 01:07:45,070
but I am still allowed to dream, are I not?

910
01:08:03,220 --> 01:08:04,850
Your heels are not scraped up today, are they?

911
01:08:05,720 --> 01:08:06,720
What?

912
01:08:08,060 --> 01:08:09,060
No.

913
01:08:10,320 --> 01:08:11,330
Good.

914
01:08:20,970 --> 01:08:22,540
- Your Highness! - Your Highness.

915
01:08:33,150 --> 01:08:34,980
Wait...

916
01:08:36,320 --> 01:08:37,820
Just wait here for a moment.

917
01:08:38,390 --> 01:08:39,390
But I...

918
01:08:40,020 --> 01:08:41,020
Do not come in.

919
01:08:48,930 --> 01:08:51,670
What was that about? What is with this elaborate ditching?

920
01:09:02,210 --> 01:09:04,080
I waited all night.

921
01:09:09,550 --> 01:09:13,920
You cannot just mess with someone in the middle of the night.

922
01:10:15,050 --> 01:10:16,050
No.

923
01:10:16,780 --> 01:10:18,220
You were not supposed to come in yet.

924
01:11:00,930 --> 01:11:02,230
Black and white...

925
01:11:02,800 --> 01:11:04,900
do not just belong to the cold winter nights.

926
01:11:07,870 --> 01:11:09,100
So from now on, your season...

927
01:11:10,140 --> 01:11:11,340
will be a spring night.

928
01:11:12,870 --> 01:11:14,410
And from now on, the path you walk...

929
01:11:16,110 --> 01:11:17,240
will be a path of flowers.

930
01:11:37,300 --> 01:11:38,300
Should I make it snow?

931
01:12:38,560 --> 01:12:39,890
Do not stray too far.

932
01:14:01,940 --> 01:14:03,480
Am I still dreaming?

933
01:14:06,050 --> 01:14:08,850
Or was last night the dream?

934
01:14:10,980 --> 01:14:12,150
Why is my face...

935
01:14:18,160 --> 01:14:20,660
Goodness, what was that?

936
01:14:27,300 --> 01:14:28,500
Why? What?

937
01:14:45,250 --> 01:14:49,490
No. That is... It is not that. It is just...

938
01:14:55,630 --> 01:15:00,570
(Moon River)

939
01:15:15,750 --> 01:15:18,419
Young people these days play tug-of-war in love.

940
01:15:18,420 --> 01:15:19,820
They pretend to push you away,

941
01:15:19,850 --> 01:15:22,289
but the moment you drift apart, they pull you right back in.

942
01:15:22,290 --> 01:15:24,060
The tug-of-war in love.

943
01:15:24,190 --> 01:15:27,290
I am saying that if His Highness has other intentions,

944
01:15:27,530 --> 01:15:28,960
what guarantee is there...

945
01:15:29,300 --> 01:15:32,470
that the Gyesa Year Incident will not happen all over again?

946
01:15:32,530 --> 01:15:36,800
I heard Dal went to the capital. I will take her and leave Joseon.

947
01:15:36,900 --> 01:15:37,900
That he is in love.

948
01:15:38,840 --> 01:15:40,040
The Crown Prince loves Park Dal.

949
01:15:53,820 --> 01:15:57,920
(Moon River)
