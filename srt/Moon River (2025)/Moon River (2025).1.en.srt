00:14:37,515 --> 00:14:39,440
[of eligible women before royal selection]
and follow proper procedures

182
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:41,407
to proceed with the royal marriage.

183
00:14:41,407 --> 00:14:44,207
What's important about edicts or procedures?

184
00:14:44,207 --> 00:14:45,907
The crown princess is already chosen.

185
00:14:45,907 --> 00:14:47,507
'CP is LM's daughter,' no?

186
00:14:47,507 --> 00:14:49,807
Who's LM's daughter?

187
00:14:50,907 --> 00:14:54,340
That's someone I never would've expected to hear.

188
00:14:54,340 --> 00:14:57,174
Who could possibly have a name like that?

189
00:14:57,174 --> 00:14:59,407
Master Royal Tailor?

190
00:15:00,540 --> 00:15:02,040
With due respect,

191
00:15:02,040 --> 00:15:06,174
may I ask who LM's daughter is?

192
00:15:06,174 --> 00:15:07,974
You don't know LM's daughter?

193
00:15:07,974 --> 00:15:09,374
Goodness.

194
00:15:09,374 --> 00:15:11,940
How ignorant you all are.

195
00:15:11,940 --> 00:15:13,440
CP is LM's daughter.

196
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:17,574
After all, Crown Princess
is Left Minister's daughter.

197
00:15:17,574 --> 00:15:20,574
I've already made up my mind about it.

198
00:15:26,207 --> 00:15:28,519
Crown Prince has issued the Marriage Ban Edict.

199
00:15:29,640 --> 00:15:33,340
If Crown Prince marries your daughter

200
00:15:33,340 --> 00:15:34,443
and they have a son, the royal heir,

201
00:15:34,443 --> 00:15:35,840
[First Grandson: Eldest son of Crown Prince
not yet designated as heir]

202
00:15:35,840 --> 00:15:38,274
[King Lee Hui]
do you intend to kill Crown Prince then?

203
00:15:38,274 --> 00:15:42,471
Or make him a madman like me
to be locked away in the palace?

204
00:15:44,107 --> 00:15:47,399
Your jest goes too far, Your Majesty.

205
00:15:49,974 --> 00:15:51,440
A jest...

206
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:54,407
Do I look like I'm jesting to you right now?

207
00:15:58,174 --> 00:16:00,007
Yes.

208
00:16:00,007 --> 00:16:03,751
I called it a jest, so a jest it is.

209
00:16:04,507 --> 00:16:09,274
And I said Your Majesty's health is frail,

210
00:16:09,274 --> 00:16:12,040
therefore, Your Majesty's health is frail.

211
00:16:12,040 --> 00:16:17,207
I also said Your Majesty's madness has worsened,

212
00:16:17,207 --> 00:16:21,574
therefore, Your Majesty is unfit to rule.

213
00:16:21,574 --> 00:16:22,674
Left Minister!

214
00:16:22,674 --> 00:16:27,911
Then why did you aspire to become the true king?

215
00:16:37,374 --> 00:16:40,874
Goodness, why did they grow so large?

216
00:16:46,840 --> 00:16:51,507
Goldfish are creatures that grow
endlessly based on their environment.

217
00:16:51,507 --> 00:16:52,707
Is that so?

218
00:16:52,707 --> 00:16:55,140
'Is that so?'

219
00:16:55,140 --> 00:16:56,140
Incredible.

220
00:16:56,140 --> 00:17:00,040
I explicitly ordered all aquatic creatures
to be exterminated.

221
00:17:00,040 --> 00:17:02,474
Yet you seem familiar with
that insignificant creature?

222
00:17:02,474 --> 00:17:03,574
Do you know this goldfish?

223
00:17:03,574 --> 00:17:07,874
This fish was originally raised
in Grand Queen Dowager's hall,

224
00:17:07,874 --> 00:17:10,407
but Her Majesty ordered it discarded.

225
00:17:10,407 --> 00:17:14,207
Even a lowly creature deserves life.

226
00:17:14,207 --> 00:17:17,274
I couldn't let it perish.

227
00:17:20,807 --> 00:17:23,174
Please end me, Your Highness.

228
00:17:23,174 --> 00:17:26,407
- Please end me, Your Highness.
- Please end me, Your Highness.

229
00:17:30,874 --> 00:17:34,240
Do not speak of death so lightly.

230
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:36,743
Especially when I'm near the water.

231
00:17:38,274 --> 00:17:42,107
That goldfish breathes
and darts about freely in the water,

232
00:17:42,107 --> 00:17:44,307
but when a person enters it,

233
00:17:44,307 --> 00:17:47,783
their breath stops and they die.

234
00:17:49,007 --> 00:17:53,107
Left too long, they bloat and decay.

235
00:17:53,107 --> 00:17:58,540
A mere touch could reduce them to nothing.

236
00:17:58,540 --> 00:17:59,840
Kill m...

237
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:03,807
No, please show mercy!

238
00:18:03,807 --> 00:18:06,607
Please show mercy

239
00:18:06,607 --> 00:18:09,223
and spare me.

240
00:18:12,974 --> 00:18:14,440
The Classic of Governance states,

241
00:18:14,440 --> 00:18:16,440
'Spread benevolence widely.'

242
00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:19,740
'No matter where people live,
are they not bound to meet someday?'

243
00:18:19,740 --> 00:18:21,640
Therefore,

244
00:18:21,640 --> 00:18:23,407
I shall show you mercy.

245
00:18:23,407 --> 00:18:25,174
Your grace overwhelms me.

246
00:18:25,174 --> 00:18:30,375
But you must transcribe
'Admonitions for the Heart' to atone.

247
00:18:31,507 --> 00:18:33,240
Pardon?

248
00:18:36,907 --> 00:18:38,707
After the deposed consort's passing,

249
00:18:38,707 --> 00:18:42,440
His Highness developed
hatred for all aquatic life.

250
00:18:42,440 --> 00:18:45,240
I gave strict warnings.

251
00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:47,174
You should be grateful copying
is your only punishment.

252
00:18:47,174 --> 00:18:49,774
If you mean that consort,

253
00:18:49,774 --> 00:18:52,840
wasn't she executed with poison

254
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:55,007
over the queen's assassination incident?

255
00:18:55,007 --> 00:18:59,111
What connection does that have with water?

256
00:19:01,807 --> 00:19:07,740
She received the poison,
but protested innocence by drowning herself.

257
00:19:07,740 --> 00:19:11,507
His Highness personally
identified the corpse, left so long that

258
00:19:11,507 --> 00:19:14,840
it had decomposed beyond recognition.

259
00:19:14,840 --> 00:19:18,040
How could one not feel resentment
toward the water?

260
00:19:18,707 --> 00:19:22,607
One cannot help but hate
the creatures swimming within it.

261
00:19:46,074 --> 00:19:48,840
[Five years ago]
She would never kill herself.

262
00:19:48,840 --> 00:19:51,874
Someone murdered her and staged it as suicide.

263
00:19:51,874 --> 00:19:55,207
Please prove her innocence.

264
00:19:55,207 --> 00:19:57,440
She did take her own life.

265
00:19:57,440 --> 00:19:59,174
Why would she do such a thing?

266
00:19:59,174 --> 00:20:03,140
What possible reason could she have?

267
00:20:03,140 --> 00:20:04,874
I...

268
00:20:06,207 --> 00:20:07,880
ordered it.

269
00:20:14,907 --> 00:20:16,107
What do you...

270
00:20:16,107 --> 00:20:20,640
Had she lived, you'd have fled holding her hand.

271
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:22,907
If I gave her poison,

272
00:20:22,907 --> 00:20:25,307
you'd have drunk it in her place.

273
00:20:25,307 --> 00:20:27,640
I commanded her

274
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:31,207
to die in your stead.

275
00:20:32,840 --> 00:20:35,307
You were protected by your mother, your consort,

276
00:20:35,307 --> 00:20:38,207
and your father-in-law's blood.

277
00:20:38,207 --> 00:20:40,487
Never forget the weight of your life.

278
00:20:41,474 --> 00:20:44,140
I never wished for this.

279
00:20:45,507 --> 00:20:48,307
For whom did they die?

280
00:20:50,440 --> 00:20:53,319
I'm already shattered,

281
00:20:54,807 --> 00:20:57,383
yet for whom did they perish?

282
00:21:05,707 --> 00:21:08,474
I died long ago.

283
00:21:08,474 --> 00:21:11,440
It was Your Majesty who killed me.

284
00:21:42,474 --> 00:21:44,807
You must've been so cold.

285
00:21:45,540 --> 00:21:47,907
You were scared, weren't you?

286
00:21:53,474 --> 00:21:55,527
But don't worry anymore.

287
00:21:57,240 --> 00:21:59,239
I'll be there soon.

288
00:22:25,640 --> 00:22:27,407
Why...

289
00:22:28,574 --> 00:22:31,974
Why?

290
00:22:33,540 --> 00:22:36,456
We still need you, Your Highness.

291
00:22:36,456 --> 00:22:40,040
For now, please live.

292
00:22:40,707 --> 00:22:45,174
When I say it is done,
you may then give up your life.

293
00:22:45,174 --> 00:22:49,774
This is the new law of the palace.

294
00:22:49,774 --> 00:22:53,274
Do you think I'll comply?

295
00:22:53,274 --> 00:22:56,107
Do you think I will meekly step aside

296
00:22:56,107 --> 00:22:58,840
so your daughter may sit in the consort's chambers

297
00:22:58,840 --> 00:23:02,040
and her bloodline may take the throne?

298
00:23:02,040 --> 00:23:04,740
You must.

299
00:23:04,740 --> 00:23:08,040
That's exactly why I killed the queen

300
00:23:08,040 --> 00:23:10,983
and framed the deposed consort.

301
00:23:13,640 --> 00:23:16,207
Now that all's done,

302
00:23:16,207 --> 00:23:19,274
why reveal the truth?

303
00:23:19,274 --> 00:23:24,907
Because knowing changes nothing, Your Highness.

304
00:23:24,907 --> 00:23:28,474
None dare punish me.

305
00:23:28,474 --> 00:23:31,474
No, none will punish me.

306
00:23:31,474 --> 00:23:34,607
There would be countless people

307
00:23:34,607 --> 00:23:37,840
in this court who'd die in my place.

308
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:39,574
So that's why

309
00:23:40,374 --> 00:23:44,774
you chose to kill yourself
instead of taking revenge.

310
00:23:47,674 --> 00:23:49,907
How weak.

311
00:23:52,174 --> 00:23:54,240
You rat.

312
00:23:56,040 --> 00:23:59,574
You rat!

313
00:24:05,107 --> 00:24:10,607
No one fears anger driven by cowardice.

314
00:24:10,607 --> 00:24:13,671
Weakness is cowardice, and helplessness is sin.

315
00:24:15,240 --> 00:24:17,474
Become stronger.

316
00:24:22,674 --> 00:24:26,807
Only strength embodies justice in this world.

317
00:24:54,540 --> 00:24:57,374
Your Highness.

318
00:24:57,374 --> 00:24:59,040
Are you alright?

319
00:24:59,040 --> 00:25:01,140
I'll summon the royal physician.

320
00:25:03,774 --> 00:25:05,607
I'm fine.

321
00:25:46,540 --> 00:25:48,607
I miss you.

322
00:26:08,807 --> 00:26:10,466
[Uljin]

323
00:26:14,407 --> 00:26:16,507
Buy some fish.

324
00:26:16,507 --> 00:26:18,307
Get your pollock.

325
00:26:18,307 --> 00:26:22,274
- Take a look.
- We have pollock.

326
00:26:23,273 --> 00:26:26,083
Hey, watch where you going.

327
00:26:29,574 --> 00:26:32,207
Excuse me.

328
00:26:32,207 --> 00:26:33,640
Hello.

329
00:26:33,640 --> 00:26:35,074
Yes.

330
00:26:35,074 --> 00:26:37,340
Just passing through.

331
00:26:39,407 --> 00:26:41,907
It's been a while.

332
00:26:41,907 --> 00:26:44,740
Oh, have you eaten?

333
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:50,907
I'm scared of fish eyes.

334
00:26:52,940 --> 00:26:55,440
Aren't you running a business?

335
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:58,974
What've you been looking for so leisurely?

336
00:26:58,974 --> 00:27:02,107
Where's the biggest house here?

337
00:27:02,107 --> 00:27:03,940
That house there.

338
00:27:08,840 --> 00:27:11,174
Is anyone home?

339
00:27:11,174 --> 00:27:13,140
What's going on?

340
00:27:16,307 --> 00:27:20,607
A cup of water shouldn't be too much
to ask in such a grand house, right?

341
00:27:26,707 --> 00:27:28,707
I really enjoyed the water.

342
00:27:28,707 --> 00:27:32,140
Not a mountain hare or anything,
are you really just drinking water and leaving?

343
00:27:32,140 --> 00:27:33,807
Not selling anything?

344
00:27:33,807 --> 00:27:36,340
Buyers know what they want.
How should the seller know?

345
00:27:36,340 --> 00:27:40,507
I need to know what you're selling
to decide whether to buy.

346
00:27:40,507 --> 00:27:43,840
Forget it. You'd have mentioned earlier
if you needed something.

347
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:46,440
I really enjoyed the water.

348
00:27:47,274 --> 00:27:49,374
Wait.

349
00:27:50,307 --> 00:27:52,640
Then...

350
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:54,707
shall I unpack?

351
00:27:57,040 --> 00:27:59,740
I'm not even saying a word.

352
00:27:59,740 --> 00:28:03,307
This salt is speaking. Listen carefully.

353
00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:06,540
Huh?

354
00:28:06,540 --> 00:28:08,407
Hey.

355
00:28:09,274 --> 00:28:11,374
The salt speaks.

356
00:28:14,740 --> 00:28:18,240
'I'm premium-grade salt.'

357
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:22,440
'You're a fool if you don't buy me.'

358
00:28:22,440 --> 00:28:24,507
Oh, my.

359
00:28:41,340 --> 00:28:44,207
Oh, thank you.

360
00:28:51,207 --> 00:28:53,674
It's salt.

361
00:28:53,674 --> 00:28:55,540
Oh, my.

362
00:29:07,307 --> 00:29:11,340

and was trying to inform you.

You know the saying,

'A stone thrown in jest
killed the load-carrying porter.'

Frog, merchant, or noble,

- Apologize.
- Nonsense.

381

How can a noble apologize to a lowly porter?

382
00:30:15,674 --> 00:30:20,140
Yes, I may be ignorant
and know nothing of the laws of rank,

383

but I understand basic human decency.

384

Whether noble or commoner,
wrongdoers must apologize.

And if they still can't grasp that,
there's only one solution.

I step aside because it's filth,
not because I'm scared.

Yeah, that's the right way to think.

415

You can't solve everything

In Joseon, the fate of nobles

But here's the thing.

420
00:32:00,907 --> 00:32:03,974
If I was born lowly from the start

421
00:32:03,974 --> 00:32:07,707
and got used to being treated poorly,
maybe I could accept it.

422

As you both know, Mother and Father,

423
00:32:09,407 --> 00:32:14,074
when I almost drowned years ago,
my entire memory was washed away.

My mind is clouded, my memories dark,

425
00:32:16,674 --> 00:32:19,507
and yet I woke up to discover I'm a lowborn.

426
00:32:19,507 --> 00:32:22,940
I can't even tell whether I'm noble or commoner,
and yet they call me a commoner.

427
00:32:22,940 --> 00:32:25,240
How am I supposed to adjust to this?

428
00:32:25,240 --> 00:32:26,474
How can I not be resentful?

Fine. Go make your money quick, buy yourself
a certificate of rank, and become a noble.

But in Utopia, isn't Hong Gildong playing king?

so young. She weeps so bitterly.

she'll follow her dead husband to the grave.

00:52:11,407 --> 00:52:13,223
How can you just leave like that?

721
00:52:14,074 --> 00:52:16,040
What about that?

722
00:52:17,774 --> 00:52:21,007
Oh, no, it's broken. What a waste.

723
00:52:22,540 --> 00:52:24,974
What's with that reaction?

724
00:52:24,974 --> 00:52:28,274
You break my things and stay this calm.

725
00:52:31,207 --> 00:52:32,607
What am I supposed to do with you?

726
00:52:32,607 --> 00:52:34,940
Strictly speaking, I'm not the one who broke it.

727
00:52:34,940 --> 00:52:36,707
But you threw it at my head.

728
00:52:36,707 --> 00:52:38,640
I didn't throw it.
I dropped it because I was startled.

729
00:52:38,640 --> 00:52:39,774
Well, I'm a woman.

730
00:52:39,774 --> 00:52:42,207
So when some dark-looking man stood there
watching me while I was changing,

731
00:52:42,207 --> 00:52:44,007
of course I got startled and screamed.

732
00:52:44,007 --> 00:52:45,407
That's just common sense, isn't it?

733
00:52:45,407 --> 00:52:49,474
Who carries something valuable
up to high places anyway?

734
00:53:05,307 --> 00:53:09,507
Your shamelessness reminds me
so much of someone I know.

735
00:53:10,507 --> 00:53:12,007
Even if

736
00:53:12,007 --> 00:53:15,015
my life depended on it,
I don't have that kind of money.

737
00:53:17,240 --> 00:53:20,640
If you want, you can peel off my skin
and turn it into winter fabric.

738
00:53:20,640 --> 00:53:22,440
At least that'll contribute to the household.

739
00:53:22,440 --> 00:53:24,507
How can you say such vulgar things...

740
00:53:24,507 --> 00:53:27,840
Life's a winding minefield, so I don't exactly
have a knack for saying gentle things.

741
00:53:27,840 --> 00:53:29,540
So?

742
00:53:29,540 --> 00:53:32,907
What do you plan to do with me now?

743
00:53:32,907 --> 00:53:35,140
What's there to do?

744
00:53:35,140 --> 00:53:38,674
You think I'd kill you over an object?

745
00:53:38,674 --> 00:53:42,340
Then, you're forgiving me now?

746
00:53:42,340 --> 00:53:44,040
Of course.

747
00:53:45,007 --> 00:53:47,374
Compensation.

748
00:53:47,374 --> 00:53:49,340
That's all there is to it.

749
00:53:56,507 --> 00:53:59,527
Father, Mother.

750
00:54:00,140 --> 00:54:01,740
I'm leaving.

751
00:54:01,740 --> 00:54:03,507
Where are you going?

752
00:54:03,507 --> 00:54:07,340
Wait here until I finish my business.

753
00:54:08,507 --> 00:54:10,759
- Servant!
- Yes.

754
00:54:16,607 --> 00:54:17,774
That's strange.

755
00:54:17,774 --> 00:54:19,540
Where did the silver dagger go?

756
00:54:19,540 --> 00:54:21,639
Dal I took them all.

757
00:54:22,407 --> 00:54:25,474
Why would a salt seller
take the silver dagger? And all of them?

758
00:54:25,474 --> 00:54:28,040
Maybe her dream is to be like Chun Hyang.

759
00:54:28,040 --> 00:54:31,607
'Mong Ryong, want me to peel a pear for you?'

760
00:54:34,907 --> 00:54:36,507
Come to think of it,

761
00:54:36,507 --> 00:54:39,783
she took the salt jar,

762
00:54:42,474 --> 00:54:46,074
but didn't take the salt.

763
00:54:46,074 --> 00:54:47,774
What?

764
00:54:56,374 --> 00:55:00,007
Oh, my, oh, my.

765
00:55:00,007 --> 00:55:03,174
Oh, my stomach.

766
00:55:03,174 --> 00:55:05,674
Oh, no, it's coming out.

767
00:55:11,574 --> 00:55:14,207
Even so, I'm a woman.

768
00:55:14,207 --> 00:55:17,040
How could I possibly do my business
in front of a man?

769
00:55:17,974 --> 00:55:21,707
I won't look, so don't you worry, okay?

770
00:55:21,707 --> 00:55:23,540
There.

771
00:55:35,740 --> 00:55:38,340
Wait, what's that noise?

772
00:55:38,340 --> 00:55:41,740
Pooping into the chamber pot... really?

773
00:55:41,740 --> 00:55:43,574
What lies could my backside possibly tell?

774
00:55:43,574 --> 00:55:45,874
When nature calls, it answers.

775
00:55:45,874 --> 00:55:49,240
By the way, this is ten-day aged stuff.
Plug your nose tight.

776
00:55:49,240 --> 00:55:50,640
You won't be able to hold it.

777
00:55:50,640 --> 00:55:53,574
Oh, wait!

778
00:55:53,574 --> 00:55:55,807
Oh, for goodness.

779
00:55:55,807 --> 00:55:57,040
What now?

780
00:55:57,040 --> 00:56:00,507
Should I sit? Stand?

781
00:56:01,307 --> 00:56:03,140
Stand up.

782
00:56:31,374 --> 00:56:33,607
What a lively rhythm.

783
00:56:33,607 --> 00:56:35,740
Ours truly is the best.

784
00:56:35,740 --> 00:56:37,607
Don't you agree?

785
00:56:51,907 --> 00:56:54,707
You just praised the local pride,

786
00:56:54,707 --> 00:56:57,040
but why go stealing foreign goods?

787
00:56:57,040 --> 00:56:59,640
Did you miss your little brother this much?

788
00:56:59,640 --> 00:57:01,540
You came all the way here after me?

789
00:57:01,540 --> 00:57:04,840
You dare steal my clock and flee to Qing?

790
00:57:04,840 --> 00:57:09,240
Did you think I'd forgive you
after a month of hiding?

791
00:57:09,240 --> 00:57:10,840
This isn't yours, brother. It's mine.

792
00:57:10,840 --> 00:57:12,707
I bought it with my own money.
My money, my purchase.

793
00:57:12,707 --> 00:57:14,540
But I ordered it first!

794
00:57:14,540 --> 00:57:16,840
Ah, don't you remember?

795
00:57:16,840 --> 00:57:18,474
Our long-standing rule between you and me.

796
00:57:18,474 --> 00:57:19,807
First to claim keeps it.

797
00:57:19,807 --> 00:57:24,474
Didn't you snatch my telescope last time?

798
00:57:25,140 --> 00:57:28,574
Cut the smug talk and hand it over, now.

799
00:57:31,307 --> 00:57:33,007
It's...

800
00:57:36,940 --> 00:57:38,440
Broken.

801
00:57:38,440 --> 00:57:41,474
How could something
that expensive break so easily?

802
00:57:41,474 --> 00:57:43,040
When it broke,

803
00:57:43,040 --> 00:57:45,407
I thought my heart was breaking with it.

804
00:57:45,407 --> 00:57:46,474
Oh, no, what now?

805
00:57:46,474 --> 00:57:50,240
Everyone out! Get out now!

806
00:57:52,807 --> 00:57:55,374
- You want to die?
- Well...

807
00:57:55,374 --> 00:57:59,440
Why take it if you can't protect it properly?

808
00:58:07,240 --> 00:58:09,986
Get over here! Let go!

809
00:58:09,986 --> 00:58:11,881
You!

810
00:58:24,107 --> 00:58:25,831
They left.

811
00:58:26,740 --> 00:58:29,440
Five years passed, and you still can't act?

812
00:58:29,440 --> 00:58:32,474
Is playing a thug so hard
you can't fool one minister?

813
00:58:32,474 --> 00:58:34,574
My natural grace...

814
00:58:34,574 --> 00:58:35,640
That's not it.

815
00:58:35,640 --> 00:58:40,140
Your Highness is none other than
the greatest madman of all time.

816
00:58:40,140 --> 00:58:42,174
You are the very embodiment

817
00:58:42,174 --> 00:58:44,940
of a reckless, thuggish scoundrel.

818
00:58:44,940 --> 00:58:47,407
Left Minister just suspects too much.

819
00:58:47,407 --> 00:58:48,974
Hey, give me the sword. Now.

820
00:58:48,974 --> 00:58:51,740
You punk.

821
00:58:51,740 --> 00:58:54,707
You want a taste of my blade?

822
00:59:08,407 --> 00:59:10,439
Don't fret too much.

823
00:59:11,040 --> 00:59:14,374
If I perform the sword dance,

824
00:59:14,374 --> 00:59:17,031
it will be for Left Minister alone.

825
00:59:20,174 --> 00:59:23,174
I'll sever his head,

826
00:59:23,174 --> 00:59:26,503
and avenge Her Majesty the Queen
and Crown Princess.

827
00:59:27,674 --> 00:59:28,674
It appears Prince Je Woon

828
00:59:28,674 --> 00:59:31,140
intercepted the treasure Crown Prince

829
00:59:31,140 --> 00:59:33,374
ordered from Qing a month ago.

830
00:59:33,374 --> 00:59:36,935
He seems to have spent a month in Qing
avoiding Crown Prince's wrath.

831
00:59:40,607 --> 00:59:44,374
They're just callow kids
squabbling over toys at best.

832
00:59:44,374 --> 00:59:46,740
Why be so on guard?

833
00:59:48,307 --> 00:59:51,943
Genghis Khan's driving force
was paternal vengeance.

834
00:59:53,274 --> 00:59:57,707
Are you saying Crown Prince
aspires to be Genghis Khan?

835
00:59:57,707 --> 01:00:00,607
Crown Prince lost his consort,

836
01:00:00,607 --> 01:00:05,040
and I turned Prince Je Woon's mother
into a vengeful ghost.

837
01:00:05,040 --> 01:00:07,943
Both surely bear grudges against me.

838
01:00:09,274 --> 01:00:13,007
Doubt builds sturdier walls than stone,

839
01:00:13,007 --> 01:00:17,415
and vengeance forges the sharpest blade.

840
01:00:20,174 --> 01:00:23,540
[Woman]

841
01:00:23,540 --> 01:00:26,007
Stop fooling around.

842
01:00:26,640 --> 01:00:29,140
I'm working here.

843
01:00:30,474 --> 01:00:32,340
Working here.

844
01:00:40,440 --> 01:00:42,807
Wait, why are you...

845
01:00:49,507 --> 01:00:51,774
That... catch that gisaeng.

846
01:00:51,774 --> 01:00:53,840
The one in straw sandals.

847
01:00:53,840 --> 01:00:55,607
By order of Prince Je Woon.

848
01:00:55,607 --> 01:00:58,174
- Move aside.
- Catch her.

849
01:00:59,774 --> 01:01:02,074
Catch that gisaeng.

850
01:01:04,357 --> 01:01:06,340
Oh, darn it.

851
01:01:06,340 --> 01:01:08,607
Sorry! I'm sorry!

852
01:01:08,607 --> 01:01:10,340
Someone catch her!

853
01:01:10,340 --> 01:01:13,140
This is Prince Je Woon's command!

854
01:01:15,207 --> 01:01:17,227
Someone catch her!

855
01:01:17,227 --> 01:01:19,147
Get her!

856
01:01:22,607 --> 01:01:24,974
Someone catch her!

857
01:01:27,723 --> 01:01:29,995
Hey, wait!

858
01:01:29,995 --> 01:01:32,840
- She's on the roof!
- What's happening?

859
01:01:32,840 --> 01:01:36,807
Underestimate a porter's stamina
and you'll regret it.

860
01:01:36,807 --> 01:01:38,440
Wait, that's...

861
01:01:38,440 --> 01:01:39,440
Hold on.

862
01:01:39,440 --> 01:01:42,040
- What's wrong?
- Just leave me alone.

863
01:01:45,643 --> 01:01:47,429
Geez.

864
01:01:52,740 --> 01:01:56,707
Underestimate a servant's persistence,

865
01:01:56,707 --> 01:01:59,335
- and you'll end up badly hurt.
- Geez.

866
01:02:00,207 --> 01:02:02,840
Don't go any further.

867
01:02:06,540 --> 01:02:08,907
It's nothing serious.

868
01:02:08,907 --> 01:02:10,340
About Dal I.

869
01:02:10,340 --> 01:02:13,674
Why must she avoid Hanyang?

870
01:02:13,674 --> 01:02:16,007
It's just my sudden curiosity.

871
01:02:16,007 --> 01:02:17,940
Didn't I tell you?

872
01:02:17,940 --> 01:02:20,071
She's a fugitive slave from Hanyang.

873
01:02:20,840 --> 01:02:23,559
Slave hunters still hunt her.

874
01:02:25,607 --> 01:02:27,674
Tell me straight.

875
01:02:27,674 --> 01:02:30,855
Dal I isn't just a slave, right?

876
01:02:32,107 --> 01:02:33,840
What's her true identity?

877
01:02:33,840 --> 01:02:35,707
Dal I is...

878
01:02:39,374 --> 01:02:41,640
Could Dal I have gone to Hanyang?

879
01:02:41,640 --> 01:02:43,874
No.

880
01:02:44,707 --> 01:02:47,774
Hanyang? Why would...

881
01:02:47,774 --> 01:02:49,907
She went to Pyongyang. Pyongyang.

882
01:02:49,907 --> 01:02:52,040
Mark my words.

883
01:02:52,040 --> 01:02:54,574
Dal I must never

884
01:02:54,574 --> 01:02:57,107
set foot in Hanyang.

885
01:03:00,374 --> 01:03:02,274
Stop following me.

886
01:03:02,274 --> 01:03:03,340
Wait.

887
01:03:03,340 --> 01:03:06,207
If you fall again here, you could die.

888
01:03:06,207 --> 01:03:09,274
Don't move, seriously.

889
01:03:09,274 --> 01:03:11,340
Come with me now,

890
01:03:11,340 --> 01:03:14,774
and I'll keep this from Prince Je Woon.

891
01:03:14,774 --> 01:03:16,507
Prince Je Woon?

892
01:03:16,507 --> 01:03:18,274
If he's a prince...

893
01:03:18,907 --> 01:03:20,607
The one who brought me here was a royal relative?

894
01:03:20,607 --> 01:03:22,640
[Royal Relative: A member of the king's family]
If he were just a royal relative, you'd be lucky.

895
01:03:22,640 --> 01:03:26,140
He's the late king's only legitimate son.

896
01:03:26,974 --> 01:03:30,407
Still, it's a gibang alright,
but why is it so noisy here?

897
01:03:30,407 --> 01:03:33,074
Jeez.

898
01:03:33,074 --> 01:03:38,140
If you resist, I'll report everything
to Prince Je Woon.

899
01:03:41,007 --> 01:03:42,907
Better to die

900
01:03:43,974 --> 01:03:45,707
than suffer.

901
01:04:12,640 --> 01:04:14,374
Huh?

902
01:04:19,507 --> 01:04:22,674
So, what will happen?

903
01:04:24,540 --> 01:04:27,107
She will die.

904
01:04:27,107 --> 01:04:29,107
His Majesty will send you poison.

905
01:04:29,107 --> 01:04:31,774
You must flee, Your Highness.

906
01:04:35,640 --> 01:04:44,074
<i>♫ Oh, will my love return to me ♫</i>

907
01:04:44,074 --> 01:04:53,407
<i>♫ Oh, how futile all becomes ♫</i>

908
01:04:54,274 --> 01:04:57,340
<i>♫ All but a dream ♫</i>

909
01:05:04,407 --> 01:05:06,407
<i>No one</i>

910
01:05:06,407 --> 01:05:09,107
<i>must recognize</i>

911
01:05:12,840 --> 01:05:14,107
<i>her.</i>

912
01:05:14,107 --> 01:05:21,407
<i>♫ Oh, how futile all becomes ♫</i>

913
01:05:21,407 --> 01:05:25,807
<i>♫ Born of dreams, living and dying in dreams ♫</i>

914
01:05:25,807 --> 01:05:29,474
<i>♫ It's all for naught ♫</i>

915
01:05:30,140 --> 01:05:39,707
<i>♫ What use is dreaming such dreams ♫</i>

916
01:06:03,174 --> 01:06:05,540
- I missed you, my lady.
- Oh, my.

917
01:06:05,540 --> 01:06:07,540
You have parents? Since when?

918
01:06:07,540 --> 01:06:09,307
Since I was born, of course.

919
01:06:09,307 --> 01:06:13,040
Or do you know what happens

920
01:06:13,040 --> 01:06:15,107
if you catch a falling petal?

921
01:06:15,107 --> 01:06:18,540
If you catch a falling petal...

922
01:06:18,540 --> 01:06:21,040
She seems entangled in grave matters.

923
01:06:21,040 --> 01:06:23,340
Let go. Let go of me!

924
01:06:23,340 --> 01:06:25,274
If I sort this out...

925
01:06:25,274 --> 01:06:26,774
Where is she, that girl?

926
01:06:26,774 --> 01:06:28,940
Will you answer me?

927
01:06:28,940 --> 01:06:31,340
Where is that girl!
