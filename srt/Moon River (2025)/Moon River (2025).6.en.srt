1
00:00:09,115 --> 00:00:10,355
(All people, incidents, and backgrounds...)

2
00:00:10,425 --> 00:00:11,655
(in this drama are fictitious and unrelated to reality.)

3
00:00:11,725 --> 00:00:13,025
(Also, children and animals were filmed under production guidelines.)

4
00:00:26,465 --> 00:00:30,175
- What? It is just a kid?
- Let go! Let go, you murderer!

5
00:00:36,745 --> 00:00:38,245
So you are the Jimjo merchant's son.

6
00:00:39,915 --> 00:00:41,555
You were nowhere to be found when I was looking.

7
00:00:41,955 --> 00:00:42,955
Why now, of all times?

8
00:00:45,425 --> 00:00:46,955
If only you had shown up two months later.

9
00:00:52,465 --> 00:00:54,194
- Household man.
- Yes, my lord.

10
00:00:54,195 --> 00:00:56,095
Goodness, hold still!

11
00:00:57,735 --> 00:01:00,035
Open up! Open the door! Let me out!

12
00:01:00,605 --> 00:01:02,035
Prepare my official robes at once.

13
00:01:02,075 --> 00:01:05,304
Pardon? It is long before the morning drum rings.

14
00:01:05,305 --> 00:01:06,405
What?

15
00:01:08,745 --> 00:01:10,114
That is it for sleep tonight.

16
00:01:10,115 --> 00:01:11,845
I will go to the palace as soon as the drum rings.

17
00:01:11,985 --> 00:01:14,455
If I may ask, sir, what happened?

18
00:01:14,615 --> 00:01:17,015
It seems Jimjo is still with the Left State Councillor.

19
00:01:51,255 --> 00:01:52,255
Do not stray too far.

20
00:02:06,205 --> 00:02:07,905
Shoo.

21
00:02:12,605 --> 00:02:13,645
It is gone. The honeybee.

22
00:02:16,915 --> 00:02:17,915
I said, it is gone.

23
00:02:30,895 --> 00:02:31,965
I must be losing my mind.

24
00:02:32,865 --> 00:02:33,935
I have completely lost it.

25
00:03:35,295 --> 00:03:38,565
(Chapter Six: One Body and Soul, Gang Is Dal)

26
00:03:40,635 --> 00:03:42,065
My lady... No.

27
00:03:42,435 --> 00:03:44,535
I mean, Your Highness. Do you ever sleep?

28
00:03:45,535 --> 00:03:48,075
Why are you out walking at dawn every day?

29
00:04:10,865 --> 00:04:13,225
My congratulations on becoming the Crown Princess Consort...

30
00:04:21,435 --> 00:04:23,205
You say that while you are still trembling.

31
00:04:32,945 --> 00:04:35,215
Your Royal Wedding is imminent.

32
00:04:35,915 --> 00:04:38,925
You must put the past behind you and live happily with His Highness.

33
00:04:39,155 --> 00:04:42,355
Unless we have the wedding, I could remain his consort for years...

34
00:04:43,595 --> 00:04:45,025
and still not truly be his wife.

35
00:04:45,495 --> 00:04:46,525
What are you talking about?

36
00:04:47,935 --> 00:04:50,335
Then why did you come to the palace at all?

37
00:04:51,665 --> 00:04:54,275
So if you use that gun to avoid entering the palace,

38
00:04:54,575 --> 00:04:57,445
are you saying you will abandon Grand Prince Je Un?

39
00:04:58,975 --> 00:05:00,505
Because I had no other choice.

40
00:05:02,875 --> 00:05:04,785
Are you going to use me as an excuse again?

41
00:05:05,745 --> 00:05:07,685
You seem to be mistaken, so allow me to set you straight.

42
00:05:10,315 --> 00:05:11,825
You were never in love with me.

43
00:05:15,595 --> 00:05:17,055
Then what was it that I felt?

44
00:05:18,465 --> 00:05:20,225
What we had all those years...

45
00:05:21,295 --> 00:05:22,395
What was it?

46
00:05:23,195 --> 00:05:24,865
Pity. Admiration.

47
00:05:25,305 --> 00:05:28,075
Just pathetic foolishness, mistaking it for love.

48
00:05:28,875 --> 00:05:30,605
If you call that love,

49
00:05:33,045 --> 00:05:34,645
is that not an insult to love itself?

50
00:05:38,545 --> 00:05:41,515
If you are no longer swayed by me, then how about this?

51
00:05:42,555 --> 00:05:45,425
The Crown Prince took that peddler on as a eunuch.

52
00:05:48,425 --> 00:05:50,295
How can a woman become a eunuch?

53
00:05:50,795 --> 00:05:53,165
Where is she? Where is Dal right now?

54
00:05:53,895 --> 00:05:55,835
You are so worried with that look on your face.

55
00:05:57,065 --> 00:05:58,335
That is why I made up my mind.

56
00:06:00,775 --> 00:06:03,935
Whether the Crown Prince gets hurt, she gets hurt, or they both do,

57
00:06:04,675 --> 00:06:05,845
it will all be...

58
00:06:07,945 --> 00:06:09,215
your fault, Grand Prince.

59
00:06:18,255 --> 00:06:20,584
Your Highness, any further delay,

60
00:06:20,585 --> 00:06:22,095
and you will be late for the assembly.

61
00:06:22,625 --> 00:06:24,165
I am coming in, Your Highness.

62
00:06:25,365 --> 00:06:26,595
What? Her Highness, the Crown Princess!

63
00:06:27,965 --> 00:06:29,665
- Announce me.
- Do not.

64
00:06:30,635 --> 00:06:31,835
Grand Prince Je Un.

65
00:06:33,135 --> 00:06:35,305
- Announce me.
- I said, do not announce her!

66
00:06:36,805 --> 00:06:38,575
You have not even had the Royal Wedding yet.

67
00:06:39,245 --> 00:06:41,645
How dare you enter his quarters unannounced?

68
00:06:41,745 --> 00:06:43,315
Since I have already broken protocol,

69
00:06:44,515 --> 00:06:47,115
- why do I not break a few more?
- What?

70
00:07:08,705 --> 00:07:11,005
Gosh, it is so loud.

71
00:07:19,085 --> 00:07:20,645
Why? What?

72
00:07:28,995 --> 00:07:32,665
No. That is... It is not that. It is just...

73
00:07:32,765 --> 00:07:34,165
Escort Her Highness out.

74
00:07:35,365 --> 00:07:37,835
- But...
- We should go, Your Highness.

75
00:07:38,065 --> 00:07:40,935
Oh, my gosh. What in the world is happening?

76
00:07:44,345 --> 00:07:45,605
Everyone, leave us.

77
00:07:46,445 --> 00:07:50,045
Say a word and you will be punished. Do you understand?

78
00:07:50,115 --> 00:07:51,285
Yes, sir. We understand.

79
00:07:53,115 --> 00:07:54,115
Hurry along.

80
00:07:57,685 --> 00:08:00,325
- Hey! What are you doing here?
- What did you do to my body?

81
00:08:00,385 --> 00:08:01,924
Done something? Please!

82
00:08:01,925 --> 00:08:03,324
If I had, I would not feel so wronged.

83
00:08:03,325 --> 00:08:04,365
Hey, and another thing,

84
00:08:04,595 --> 00:08:06,165
- Oh, my.
- This is my body you are in!

85
00:08:10,735 --> 00:08:15,775
Do you think this is the time for an "I am you, you are me" chat?

86
00:08:16,335 --> 00:08:19,045
The Chief Court Lady's niece and the Crown Princess saw it all.

87
00:08:19,645 --> 00:08:21,245
To anyone watching,

88
00:08:22,075 --> 00:08:25,515
it was like an affair between men, Your Highness.

89
00:08:29,715 --> 00:08:31,085
Darn it.

90
00:08:41,995 --> 00:08:42,995
Please...

91
00:08:43,735 --> 00:08:45,235
just do not do anything.

92
00:08:55,045 --> 00:08:57,645
Things were already going well.

93
00:08:58,685 --> 00:09:02,555
- Why did the Crown Princess see it?
- What should we do?

94
00:09:03,115 --> 00:09:05,885
Will this not put that girl, Dal, in danger?

95
00:09:06,325 --> 00:09:10,295
In my 50 years at the palace, I have learned one thing.

96
00:09:13,995 --> 00:09:15,765
It is more important to avoid risk...

97
00:09:16,495 --> 00:09:18,835
than to seize an opportunity.

98
00:09:21,005 --> 00:09:22,604
It would be a different story if the Crown Prince...

99
00:09:22,605 --> 00:09:23,935
made her his concubine.

100
00:09:24,875 --> 00:09:28,375
For now, the best thing to do is stay out of it.

101
00:09:28,515 --> 00:09:31,145
You are wise, as always, Your Majesty.

102
00:09:32,785 --> 00:09:35,215
Learn from me while massaging.

103
00:09:35,385 --> 00:09:36,385
Oh, right.

104
00:09:40,255 --> 00:09:43,155
But at least the Crown Princess...

105
00:09:43,225 --> 00:09:45,395
knows I am a woman.

106
00:09:45,895 --> 00:09:47,295
That is what makes it even scarier.

107
00:09:47,935 --> 00:09:50,835
A woman who shot the Crown Prince is capable of anything.

108
00:09:53,565 --> 00:09:55,875
What are you talking about? A gun?

109
00:09:56,575 --> 00:09:58,805
The Crown Princess is the one who shot you in the chest?

110
00:09:59,405 --> 00:10:00,605
Did I forget to mention that?

111
00:10:04,015 --> 00:10:08,355
But still, the two of you have made up, right?

112
00:10:08,655 --> 00:10:13,255
She is not going to try and shoot me, is she?

113
00:10:13,885 --> 00:10:14,895
She might.

114
00:10:15,495 --> 00:10:17,655
Be careful. It is your body on the line now.

115
00:10:23,095 --> 00:10:24,465
Mom, Dad...

116
00:10:25,105 --> 00:10:26,205
I am a goner.

117
00:10:26,865 --> 00:10:27,975
Your unfilial daughter...

118
00:10:28,575 --> 00:10:29,735
is going on ahead.

119
00:10:34,305 --> 00:10:38,385
Your Highness, what has you thinking so deeply?

120
00:10:38,815 --> 00:10:40,344
The Royal Wedding is in under 50 days.

121
00:10:40,345 --> 00:10:42,685
You are not having doubts, are you?

122
00:10:43,485 --> 00:10:45,285
You are not planning something, are you?

123
00:10:46,425 --> 00:10:47,425
Do not worry.

124
00:10:48,195 --> 00:10:50,795
It will not be me making a move. The Chief Court Lady's niece will.

125
00:10:51,365 --> 00:10:53,365
The Chief Court Lady's niece?

126
00:10:54,435 --> 00:10:57,735
Is she not one of the Left State Councillor's people?

127
00:10:58,705 --> 00:11:02,635
Then why would she start a rumour that would harm His Highness?

128
00:11:03,305 --> 00:11:04,645
Because she, much like me,

129
00:11:06,075 --> 00:11:09,145
- is a fool.
- That is right. I had three!

130
00:11:11,685 --> 00:11:14,885
- Did you hear the rumour?
- What? What rumour?

131
00:11:17,285 --> 00:11:20,155
- Swear you will not tell anyone.
- Okay.

132
00:11:21,355 --> 00:11:22,355
Last night...

133
00:11:23,855 --> 00:11:26,825
The Crown Prince and his new eunuch...

134
00:11:28,465 --> 00:11:30,394
- I heard they slept together.
- Really?

135
00:11:30,395 --> 00:11:31,635
- Yes!
- That is insane!

136
00:11:31,905 --> 00:11:35,175
Why bother with these romance novels when real life is so much juicier?

137
00:11:35,235 --> 00:11:36,235
I know, right?

138
00:11:36,375 --> 00:11:37,575
My goodness.

139
00:11:38,105 --> 00:11:41,875
- Gosh, this is boring now.
- Because reality is much juicier.

140
00:11:42,115 --> 00:11:43,145
Unbelievable.

141
00:11:44,815 --> 00:11:45,815
Your Highness.

142
00:11:46,185 --> 00:11:47,685
A message arrived from your family's estate.

143
00:11:48,055 --> 00:11:49,255
It is about Grand Prince Je Un...

144
00:11:50,455 --> 00:11:51,585
What about Grand Prince Je Un?

145
00:12:17,145 --> 00:12:18,845
What do you think you are doing?

146
00:12:21,415 --> 00:12:22,755
I am taking it all back.

147
00:12:23,815 --> 00:12:28,195
The warmth I gave you, the peace, the devotion. All of it.

148
00:12:28,555 --> 00:12:30,055
Why are you doing this all of a sudden?

149
00:12:30,355 --> 00:12:34,165
I told you not to do anything. And yet...

150
00:12:36,095 --> 00:12:38,635
You had to start a rumour about His Highness and Dal.

151
00:12:43,575 --> 00:12:44,605
What is so funny?

152
00:12:45,245 --> 00:12:47,475
- Is there something on my face?
- No.

153
00:12:47,805 --> 00:12:48,875
There is nothing on it.

154
00:12:52,315 --> 00:12:55,085
Actually, you have some rice by your mouth.

155
00:12:58,955 --> 00:13:00,285
Did you know?

156
00:13:00,655 --> 00:13:03,195
U Hui, you said my face was clean.

157
00:13:03,855 --> 00:13:05,895
If you say nothing is there, then nothing is there.

158
00:13:05,925 --> 00:13:06,995
But if you say there is,

159
00:13:07,625 --> 00:13:09,695
then that is when it appeared.

160
00:13:18,275 --> 00:13:19,675
You still do not know me?

161
00:13:19,975 --> 00:13:21,374
Did you think I would take the throne...

162
00:13:21,375 --> 00:13:22,815
if you dethroned my brother?

163
00:13:24,885 --> 00:13:25,945
I suppose you are right.

164
00:13:26,585 --> 00:13:28,514
I do not know anything anymore.

165
00:13:28,515 --> 00:13:30,115
No, you do.

166
00:13:30,615 --> 00:13:33,055
You know what I want. What I desperately long for.

167
00:13:34,325 --> 00:13:35,725
The one who was not in love...

168
00:13:36,855 --> 00:13:38,425
was you, Grand Prince, not me.

169
00:13:40,395 --> 00:13:41,495
What kind of man...

170
00:13:41,835 --> 00:13:44,495
would want the woman he loves to become another's,

171
00:13:45,565 --> 00:13:46,835
and desire it so desperately?

172
00:13:49,975 --> 00:13:50,975
Fine.

173
00:13:51,775 --> 00:13:53,245
It was just youthful foolishness.

174
00:13:54,345 --> 00:13:55,675
Let us go our separate ways now.

175
00:13:57,275 --> 00:13:58,285
Very well.

176
00:13:59,485 --> 00:14:01,355
I will give you exactly what you want, Grand Prince.

177
00:14:02,285 --> 00:14:03,655
I will become the Crown Princess.

178
00:14:04,115 --> 00:14:07,185
I will become the Queen. And I will be Queen Dowager someday.

179
00:14:08,325 --> 00:14:11,225
I intend to rightfully take every single one of those steps.

180
00:14:12,965 --> 00:14:16,095
However, I might just speed up the timeline a bit.

181
00:14:17,335 --> 00:14:19,205
If the King and the Crown Prince both die,

182
00:14:19,765 --> 00:14:22,605
- the throne is yours, Grand Prince.
- You...

183
00:14:22,675 --> 00:14:23,774
Then, as King and Queen Dowager,

184
00:14:23,775 --> 00:14:25,045
we will greet each other each morning,

185
00:14:26,005 --> 00:14:27,445
we will have to see each other's faces.

186
00:14:29,515 --> 00:14:30,945
Just as we once promised,

187
00:14:32,145 --> 00:14:34,115
with gray hair and wrinkled faces,

188
00:14:34,955 --> 00:14:36,285
we will grow old together.

189
00:14:40,355 --> 00:14:41,755
And for me, that will be enough.

190
00:14:50,895 --> 00:14:51,965
From now on,

191
00:14:52,465 --> 00:14:53,935
let us never see each other again.

192
00:14:55,005 --> 00:14:56,005
Please.

193
00:14:57,205 --> 00:14:58,205
Now,

194
00:15:00,245 --> 00:15:01,515
I find you repulsive.

195
00:15:29,935 --> 00:15:31,605
If even this place grows cold,

196
00:15:34,105 --> 00:15:35,675
where do I go now?

197
00:15:42,485 --> 00:15:44,155
His Majesty and the Left State Councillor...

198
00:15:44,515 --> 00:15:46,885
will try to resolve this by finding you, Dal.

199
00:15:48,355 --> 00:15:49,555
Get me out of the palace.

200
00:15:50,025 --> 00:15:52,525
I will hide at Grand Prince Je Un's for the time being.

201
00:15:53,395 --> 00:15:54,625
Not even the Left State Councillor...

202
00:15:55,035 --> 00:15:57,865
can search a Grand Prince's home without just cause.

203
00:15:58,335 --> 00:16:00,805
But you think the Queen Dowager...

204
00:16:01,505 --> 00:16:02,775
will just sit by and do nothing?

205
00:16:04,745 --> 00:16:08,475
If it gets out she brought you here, she will be in trouble too.

206
00:16:08,775 --> 00:16:10,375
So she will not make a move for now.

207
00:16:11,585 --> 00:16:14,385
I will go to Boryeong and get your family to safety.

208
00:16:14,785 --> 00:16:15,785
While I am gone,

209
00:16:20,625 --> 00:16:21,625
hang in there.

210
00:16:39,975 --> 00:16:41,615
Your Majesty!

211
00:16:41,975 --> 00:16:44,345
Depose the Crown Prince for his affairs with men,

212
00:16:44,675 --> 00:16:47,645
and restore the moral foundation of this nation!

213
00:16:47,845 --> 00:16:50,685
- Restore it!
- Restore it!

214
00:16:51,685 --> 00:16:53,185
Your Majesty!

215
00:16:53,655 --> 00:16:55,095
To say the Crown Prince had affairs with men...

216
00:16:57,195 --> 00:16:59,925
Who dares utter such a horrendous accusation?

217
00:17:00,525 --> 00:17:02,935
The eunuch who involved His Highness in this scandal...

218
00:17:03,335 --> 00:17:05,635
entered the palace under a false identity.

219
00:17:06,335 --> 00:17:07,835
The guards are already searching for him.

220
00:17:07,935 --> 00:17:12,005
Once he is captured, His Highness should execute him...

221
00:17:12,575 --> 00:17:14,045
to put this scandal to rest.

222
00:17:15,375 --> 00:17:16,375
Go ahead and do that.

223
00:17:17,045 --> 00:17:19,445
Find every person who spread this rumour immediately...

224
00:17:20,045 --> 00:17:23,055
and bring me the eunuch who dragged the Crown Prince into this!

225
00:17:23,585 --> 00:17:25,855
- Yes, Your Majesty.
- Yes, Your Majesty.

226
00:17:36,335 --> 00:17:38,305
- Innkeeper!
- Yes, sir.

227
00:17:38,505 --> 00:17:39,565
Have you seen this person?

228
00:17:40,805 --> 00:17:42,875
- I do not think so.
- Take a good look.

229
00:18:31,085 --> 00:18:32,855
Have you seen this man?

230
00:18:33,085 --> 00:18:34,155
No, I have not.

231
00:18:50,505 --> 00:18:54,045
He was the one who always said, "The Crown Prince does not beg."

232
00:18:54,305 --> 00:18:56,115
So why is he really acting this way now?

233
00:19:09,155 --> 00:19:10,355
This is pathetic.

234
00:19:11,455 --> 00:19:12,725
To think I am reduced to begging.

235
00:19:19,835 --> 00:19:22,775
Whoever is in charge up there ought to have a conscience.

236
00:19:24,075 --> 00:19:26,275
If they had any conscience at all, they would not do this to me.

237
00:19:26,605 --> 00:19:27,775
You have already taken everything from me.

238
00:19:28,375 --> 00:19:30,775
My mother, my wife, and even my own body.

239
00:19:31,585 --> 00:19:32,915
So please, just this once...

240
00:19:36,315 --> 00:19:37,385
grant my prayer.

241
00:19:41,125 --> 00:19:42,625
If you do, I will stop cursing you,

242
00:19:43,795 --> 00:19:44,995
and I will not resent you anymore.

243
00:19:47,765 --> 00:19:49,395
At least protect...

244
00:19:53,405 --> 00:19:54,405
Dal's body.

245
00:19:56,375 --> 00:19:57,375
Please.

246
00:20:12,985 --> 00:20:14,485
Please save me, my lord.

247
00:20:14,955 --> 00:20:17,195
I know this puts you in danger too, but...

248
00:20:17,725 --> 00:20:18,725
Dal...

249
00:20:22,395 --> 00:20:23,395
Please just...

250
00:20:23,965 --> 00:20:24,965
save me.

251
00:20:25,435 --> 00:20:27,435
You are the one who saved my daughter's life.

252
00:20:27,735 --> 00:20:29,435
How could I possibly turn my back on you?

253
00:20:30,205 --> 00:20:32,845
Tell me. How can I help you?

254
00:20:35,515 --> 00:20:37,745
Please use this to help my family find refuge,

255
00:20:38,345 --> 00:20:39,615
and please take me in.

256
00:20:49,825 --> 00:20:52,195
I will be counting on you, my lord.

257
00:20:52,495 --> 00:20:55,795
You are not even stopping to eat, or to see your family.

258
00:20:56,065 --> 00:20:57,935
Now that they know I have left the palace,

259
00:20:58,405 --> 00:21:00,305
the Left State Councillor will be investigating me.

260
00:21:01,205 --> 00:21:04,005
If someone were to see me with the innkeeper's family,

261
00:21:04,205 --> 00:21:05,545
they could all be in grave danger.

262
00:21:06,175 --> 00:21:08,445
I must hurry before I stay too long and get caught.

263
00:21:08,815 --> 00:21:11,275
From what I saw, your feet are in bad shape.

264
00:21:16,885 --> 00:21:18,015
Dal...

265
00:21:19,455 --> 00:21:20,825
How did she ever endure this?

266
00:21:25,665 --> 00:21:27,295
That a life on the run...

267
00:21:27,865 --> 00:21:29,335
could be this arduous...

268
00:21:30,265 --> 00:21:31,635
and lonely.

269
00:21:32,505 --> 00:21:34,005
I had no idea.

270
00:21:38,375 --> 00:21:39,975
What do you mean by that, sir?

271
00:21:40,445 --> 00:21:42,175
Did you say Dal is your wife's niece?

272
00:21:42,415 --> 00:21:43,545
It is what Dal asked of me.

273
00:21:44,215 --> 00:21:45,985
I fear that Dal is in danger,

274
00:21:46,345 --> 00:21:47,815
so I must take her under my protection.

275
00:21:48,615 --> 00:21:52,625
So you must all close up the inn and go into hiding for a while.

276
00:21:53,185 --> 00:21:55,925
What do you mean Dal is in danger? Where is she right now?

277
00:21:56,095 --> 00:21:57,195
I cannot explain.

278
00:21:57,625 --> 00:22:01,065
I will not move a single step until you explain everything.

279
00:22:01,495 --> 00:22:02,865
You will have to kill me to make me move.

280
00:22:03,235 --> 00:22:05,805
So please, tell me!

281
00:22:11,875 --> 00:22:14,845
Hey, what is all this? You cannot just say that suddenly.

282
00:22:14,905 --> 00:22:16,645
That Dal is not our daughter anymore?

283
00:22:16,715 --> 00:22:18,414
She may not be my birth daughter,

284
00:22:18,415 --> 00:22:20,445
but we have raised her for five years.

285
00:22:20,545 --> 00:22:22,285
And now, without any proper explanation,

286
00:22:22,355 --> 00:22:24,315
how can you just take someone's daughter away like that?

287
00:22:24,385 --> 00:22:27,285
There is no time to explain. It is better if you do not know.

288
00:22:27,485 --> 00:22:28,495
From now on,

289
00:22:29,455 --> 00:22:32,365
you two must go your own way.

290
00:22:34,495 --> 00:22:36,135
Did we ever ask you for money?

291
00:22:38,195 --> 00:22:40,005
Who do you think you are? The Almighty?

292
00:22:40,265 --> 00:22:43,535
You may have been the one who brought Dal into our family,

293
00:22:44,075 --> 00:22:46,275
- but we say when this family ends.
- That is right!

294
00:22:46,305 --> 00:22:48,045
Dal went to the capital!

295
00:22:49,645 --> 00:22:52,815
I intend to take her and leave Joseon.

296
00:22:53,345 --> 00:22:55,155
That could put both of you in danger.

297
00:22:55,715 --> 00:22:57,215
I cannot explain everything,

298
00:22:57,955 --> 00:22:59,954
but Dal's secret is far bigger and more dangerous...

299
00:22:59,955 --> 00:23:01,355
than being a runaway slave!

300
00:23:02,555 --> 00:23:03,555
So what if it is?

301
00:23:06,925 --> 00:23:09,635
Remember what you said when you first gave Dal to us?

302
00:23:10,135 --> 00:23:13,705
You told us to live as a family of three so we would look normal.

303
00:23:14,965 --> 00:23:18,005
My husband felt sorry for me, as if he were adding to my burdens,

304
00:23:19,145 --> 00:23:20,205
but I was happy.

305
00:23:21,145 --> 00:23:25,645
It felt like I finally had permission to live a normal life.

306
00:23:27,745 --> 00:23:30,155
That is why I am going to continue being Dal's mother.

307
00:23:31,485 --> 00:23:32,725
Even if it gets dangerous,

308
00:23:33,825 --> 00:23:35,895
that is the life I have chosen!

309
00:23:38,795 --> 00:23:39,925
She is right.

310
00:23:40,195 --> 00:23:42,595
We are experts at making our own lives difficult.

311
00:23:42,865 --> 00:23:43,995
We bring it all on ourselves.

312
00:23:44,595 --> 00:23:46,705
So whether we go to weave sandals or weave more trouble,

313
00:23:46,765 --> 00:23:49,275
we will be so ridiculously happy that it makes other people jealous.

314
00:23:49,775 --> 00:23:50,775
So take us with you!

315
00:23:52,105 --> 00:23:55,415
Come on, lead the way! You said our daughter's in danger!

316
00:24:00,545 --> 00:24:01,615
Your Excellency.

317
00:24:01,885 --> 00:24:03,385
We have the court lady who spread the rumour.

318
00:24:03,985 --> 00:24:04,985
Kill her.

319
00:24:05,055 --> 00:24:07,155
The thing is,

320
00:24:07,825 --> 00:24:09,355
she is the Chief Court Lady's niece.

321
00:24:09,725 --> 00:24:13,395
- Who is behind this?
- No one. It is just a silly rumour.

322
00:24:13,995 --> 00:24:16,195
And it is not as if she was telling a complete lie.

323
00:24:18,495 --> 00:24:19,505
What are your orders?

324
00:24:22,005 --> 00:24:25,805
The Chief Court Lady has outlived her usefulness.

325
00:24:31,775 --> 00:24:32,785
Auntie.

326
00:24:37,015 --> 00:24:38,115
Why on earth?

327
00:24:39,085 --> 00:24:40,555
What possessed you to do something like that?

328
00:24:40,855 --> 00:24:42,425
What did you possibly think you were doing?

329
00:24:43,825 --> 00:24:44,895
Because it is unfair!

330
00:24:46,895 --> 00:24:48,695
The Crown Princess Consort tried to kill the Crown Prince,

331
00:24:49,265 --> 00:24:50,895
and she sent those ruffians after him.

332
00:24:51,465 --> 00:24:53,635
Even the Queen Dowager knew and gave the order,

333
00:24:53,965 --> 00:24:55,875
so why is the Chief Royal Secretary only one exiled?

334
00:24:56,305 --> 00:24:59,175
Why is he the only one who was exiled?

335
00:25:03,045 --> 00:25:04,115
You...

336
00:25:05,745 --> 00:25:07,745
- Do not tell me...
- It is true.

337
00:25:09,555 --> 00:25:10,655
He is the man I love.

338
00:25:11,925 --> 00:25:13,285
He is my lover.

339
00:25:15,725 --> 00:25:16,795
My lord!

340
00:25:17,255 --> 00:25:19,965
Please, I am begging you. Spare my niece's life.

341
00:25:20,325 --> 00:25:22,535
I thought you would be useful to me for a long time to come.

342
00:25:22,965 --> 00:25:23,995
What a shame.

343
00:25:25,805 --> 00:25:26,805
Dal of the Park Clan...

344
00:25:27,665 --> 00:25:29,635
I have brought information about that peddler.

345
00:25:29,775 --> 00:25:31,635
Now that the Crown Prince has lost interest in her,

346
00:25:32,205 --> 00:25:33,875
what good is that girl to me?

347
00:25:33,945 --> 00:25:36,315
Why do you suppose His Highness suddenly lost interest?

348
00:25:36,775 --> 00:25:37,815
Overnight,

349
00:25:38,985 --> 00:25:40,585
a eunuch who looks like the deposed Crown Princess...

350
00:25:41,215 --> 00:25:42,855
suddenly appears out of nowhere?

351
00:25:48,925 --> 00:25:51,025
Have you still not caught that eunuch?

352
00:25:51,425 --> 00:25:52,965
We are searching for him, Your Majesty.

353
00:25:53,525 --> 00:25:57,195
But when he is caught, what do you plan to do?

354
00:25:57,665 --> 00:25:59,105
Will you have him executed?

355
00:25:59,765 --> 00:26:00,865
He must be executed, of course.

356
00:26:01,835 --> 00:26:03,505
Take the Royal Command,

357
00:26:04,575 --> 00:26:05,575
Your Royal Highness.

358
00:26:07,975 --> 00:26:08,975
Sorry?

359
00:26:09,445 --> 00:26:13,285
Hand over the eunuch, Your Royal Highness.

360
00:26:15,115 --> 00:26:16,155
What is the meaning of this?

361
00:26:16,985 --> 00:26:19,525
Are you saying the Crown Prince is hiding the eunuch?

362
00:26:29,035 --> 00:26:30,035
Forgive me.

363
00:26:30,395 --> 00:26:33,505
- Please kill me, Your Highness.
- Please kill me, Your Highness.

364
00:26:33,565 --> 00:26:34,705
It is all right.

365
00:26:35,005 --> 00:26:36,835
Left Flank Guard, bring me a sword.

366
00:26:37,505 --> 00:26:38,874
What?

367
00:26:38,875 --> 00:26:40,905
A sword? Why?

368
00:26:41,245 --> 00:26:44,215
For daring to spill tea on your royal robe,

369
00:26:44,515 --> 00:26:46,485
you must punish this act of disloyalty.

370
00:26:47,785 --> 00:26:49,915
But she only spilled a cup of tea.

371
00:26:50,415 --> 00:26:52,725
- How is that disloyal?
- Bring me...

372
00:26:54,825 --> 00:26:55,825
the sword.

373
00:26:58,125 --> 00:26:59,125
Bring it.

374
00:26:59,765 --> 00:27:00,765
Your Majesty!

375
00:27:19,515 --> 00:27:21,284
Do you think she will be safe forever...

376
00:27:21,285 --> 00:27:23,055
just because you protect her now?

377
00:27:24,285 --> 00:27:25,425
I have to protect her for now.

378
00:27:25,955 --> 00:27:27,725
Is that not the only way to ensure her future?

379
00:27:29,395 --> 00:27:30,395
So then,

380
00:27:31,725 --> 00:27:32,925
Park Dal...

381
00:27:33,995 --> 00:27:36,765
Are you hiding that girl as well, Your Highness?

382
00:27:38,135 --> 00:27:40,065
Did you think I would not find out?

383
00:27:40,565 --> 00:27:42,875
That the eunuch... No.

384
00:27:43,775 --> 00:27:47,375
That the woman is Park Dal.

385
00:27:53,145 --> 00:27:54,315
What is the meaning of all this?

386
00:27:55,385 --> 00:27:56,385
A woman?

387
00:27:58,355 --> 00:27:59,785
Did the Left State Councillor tell the truth?

388
00:28:12,235 --> 00:28:13,235
Is anyone there?

389
00:28:16,375 --> 00:28:17,375
Why is no one around?

390
00:28:18,845 --> 00:28:20,245
Hey!

391
00:28:24,145 --> 00:28:25,275
I will be in touch.

392
00:28:33,855 --> 00:28:34,855
Gosh.

393
00:28:35,795 --> 00:28:37,655
Hey, watch it. Gosh.

394
00:28:38,155 --> 00:28:39,625
Hey, come on!

395
00:28:40,765 --> 00:28:42,365
How dare you just grab a lady's wrist like that?

396
00:28:42,495 --> 00:28:44,334
You are on the run. You cannot be out there.

397
00:28:44,335 --> 00:28:46,005
What if you get caught?

398
00:28:46,535 --> 00:28:47,665
What are you, a master of disguise?

399
00:28:47,865 --> 00:28:50,905
One minute you are a woman, then a man, a peddler, and a eunuch.

400
00:28:51,205 --> 00:28:53,745
Because the Queen Dowager caught me, I did not have a choice...

401
00:28:55,515 --> 00:28:56,515
Never mind.

402
00:28:58,515 --> 00:29:01,215
Anyway, why were you at the Crown Prince's quarters that early?

403
00:29:02,085 --> 00:29:03,515
Do not tell me that man from Qing just now...

404
00:29:04,385 --> 00:29:07,155
was he a messenger with news about the Jimjo Poison?

405
00:29:09,825 --> 00:29:11,095
How do you know about that?

406
00:29:13,595 --> 00:29:15,935
Did my brother really tell you all of that?

407
00:29:16,565 --> 00:29:18,535
Oh, right. Well...

408
00:29:22,675 --> 00:29:26,075
Yes. The Gyesa Year Incident, the Jimjo Poison, and all the rest.

409
00:29:26,145 --> 00:29:28,505
I know more about it than anyone, so you can just tell me.

410
00:29:29,975 --> 00:29:33,115
So, was there any news from Qing?

411
00:29:35,345 --> 00:29:38,055
Why would I trust you with something so important?

412
00:29:38,755 --> 00:29:40,825
I will speak to my brother directly, so stop prying.

413
00:29:40,885 --> 00:29:42,925
No, it is no use telling him. Why will you not...

414
00:29:46,595 --> 00:29:47,595
Then again...

415
00:29:47,925 --> 00:29:50,665
What good would it do for me to hear it now? I am a fugitive.

416
00:29:55,635 --> 00:29:56,975
What are you still doing here? Get out.

417
00:29:57,575 --> 00:30:01,245
- Hey, this is my house.
- You know my situation full well.

418
00:30:02,045 --> 00:30:04,545
Let me just hide out here with you for a while, all right?

419
00:30:10,485 --> 00:30:13,285
Dal. Do you want to hide behind me forever?

420
00:30:15,125 --> 00:30:17,095
Are you cursing me to be a fugitive for the rest of my life?

421
00:30:17,495 --> 00:30:20,895
You might as well go hire a shaman and put a proper curse on me.

422
00:30:20,925 --> 00:30:22,695
No. Stay by my side.

423
00:30:23,595 --> 00:30:24,635
Marry me.

424
00:30:27,405 --> 00:30:28,765
What nonsense are you spewing?

425
00:30:29,335 --> 00:30:30,575
If you marry me,

426
00:30:30,905 --> 00:30:33,175
the Left State Councillor will stop seeing you as a threat.

427
00:30:34,505 --> 00:30:35,505
Fine.

428
00:30:35,775 --> 00:30:38,375
You know my situation, so I will be blunt.

429
00:30:39,915 --> 00:30:41,415
As long as you are in the picture,

430
00:30:42,185 --> 00:30:44,655
I am worried he will either abandon his revenge,

431
00:30:45,515 --> 00:30:48,995
or break off the Royal Wedding out of resentment for U Hui.

432
00:30:50,325 --> 00:30:52,024
It is a win-win. You will be safe,

433
00:30:52,025 --> 00:30:54,265
and I will ensure the Royal Wedding succeeds.

434
00:30:55,195 --> 00:30:56,195
Think about it.

435
00:30:59,265 --> 00:31:00,435
Listen here, Grand Prince.

436
00:31:03,905 --> 00:31:04,975
Snap out of it.

437
00:31:06,945 --> 00:31:08,445
I can protect myself.

438
00:31:25,865 --> 00:31:28,865
The Crown Prince must still suffer from his accident's aftereffects.

439
00:31:30,635 --> 00:31:32,095
I trust you will understand, Left State Councillor.

440
00:31:32,535 --> 00:31:34,805
If this is indeed about His Highness's poor health,

441
00:31:35,305 --> 00:31:39,545
I would support him a thousand times over,

442
00:31:40,505 --> 00:31:41,505
but if, on the off chance,

443
00:31:41,875 --> 00:31:44,815
His Highness has other intentions...

444
00:31:47,815 --> 00:31:49,215
What guarantee is there...

445
00:31:49,985 --> 00:31:52,185
something like the Gyesa Incident from years ago...

446
00:31:53,985 --> 00:31:55,355
will not happen again?

447
00:31:55,825 --> 00:31:56,825
Left State Councillor.

448
00:33:33,655 --> 00:33:34,685
Looking for this?

449
00:33:35,625 --> 00:33:37,595
My father is still using you, I see.

450
00:33:39,295 --> 00:33:40,664
Even though he must know you helped me...

451
00:33:40,665 --> 00:33:41,995
try to kill the Crown Prince.

452
00:33:42,565 --> 00:33:45,695
And that you gave me his letter.

453
00:33:46,365 --> 00:33:47,905
He is really something, is he not?

454
00:33:48,235 --> 00:33:51,505
He never discards anyone useful, no matter the risk.

455
00:33:52,305 --> 00:33:54,745
Not you. Not me.

456
00:33:55,005 --> 00:33:56,075
Not even the Jimjo.

457
00:34:09,655 --> 00:34:11,255
Hand her over.

458
00:34:13,095 --> 00:34:14,095
If I do,

459
00:34:15,195 --> 00:34:16,565
she will be killed.

460
00:34:16,765 --> 00:34:19,095
If you are that concerned, I will make her a government slave...

461
00:34:19,865 --> 00:34:21,435
and spare her life.

462
00:34:22,705 --> 00:34:23,735
I cannot let that happen.

463
00:34:27,105 --> 00:34:28,175
Gang.

464
00:34:28,805 --> 00:34:30,445
Do not defy the Left State Councillor.

465
00:34:32,015 --> 00:34:34,045
The Gyesa Year Incident is not over yet.

466
00:34:35,115 --> 00:34:37,285
Think of the Queen and my father-in-law who died for you,

467
00:34:37,815 --> 00:34:39,425
and your wife, the Crown Princess.

468
00:34:40,855 --> 00:34:44,025
You would give up revenge and your future over a mere eunuch?

469
00:34:47,465 --> 00:34:48,495
Revenge?

470
00:34:49,935 --> 00:34:52,505
That is why I killed Her Majesty, the Queen,

471
00:34:54,365 --> 00:34:56,775
and framed the former Crown Princess for the crime.

472
00:34:57,205 --> 00:34:58,274
That is why...

473
00:34:58,275 --> 00:35:01,775
you chose death instead of getting revenge.

474
00:35:02,545 --> 00:35:03,715
How pathetic.

475
00:35:19,525 --> 00:35:21,165
Keep it as an ace up your sleeve.

476
00:35:21,865 --> 00:35:23,365
When the Left State Councillor falls,

477
00:35:23,835 --> 00:35:26,204
To keep power from the Queen Dowager when the Left State Councillor falls,

478
00:35:26,205 --> 00:35:27,505
you need some leverage of your own.

479
00:35:28,735 --> 00:35:29,775
Forgive me...

480
00:35:30,475 --> 00:35:32,035
for using this now, Father.

481
00:35:33,275 --> 00:35:34,275
Come out for a second.

482
00:35:36,415 --> 00:35:37,915
What are you talking about?

483
00:35:38,715 --> 00:35:39,715
No.

484
00:35:40,515 --> 00:35:43,215
You have to go to the interrogation chamber.

485
00:35:45,085 --> 00:35:47,455
If they punish you in front of all the ministers,

486
00:35:48,025 --> 00:35:49,695
our scandal will die down.

487
00:35:50,195 --> 00:35:51,725
His Majesty has already shown leniency,

488
00:35:52,295 --> 00:35:53,824
so if you go now, he will just enslave you,

489
00:35:53,825 --> 00:35:54,865
and that will be the end of it.

490
00:35:57,895 --> 00:36:00,835
I know you will suffer for now, Your Highness,

491
00:36:01,565 --> 00:36:04,105
but there is no other way.

492
00:36:04,805 --> 00:36:07,975
But I swear I will switch you back. Okay?

493
00:36:09,645 --> 00:36:13,715
I was a slave to begin with, so if I become one again,

494
00:36:14,015 --> 00:36:15,145
it is no big deal to me.

495
00:36:19,455 --> 00:36:22,285
I rode day and night between Boryeong and Hanyang,

496
00:36:23,095 --> 00:36:25,595
afraid I would be caught if I stopped. But even so,

497
00:36:26,665 --> 00:36:28,225
my heart ached more than my body did.

498
00:36:28,725 --> 00:36:31,235
This is how you have had to live. But...

499
00:36:32,365 --> 00:36:34,105
how can you say you were not wronged?

500
00:36:34,565 --> 00:36:35,865
Why are you being such a fool?

501
00:36:38,875 --> 00:36:39,945
Then what am I supposed to do?

502
00:36:41,305 --> 00:36:42,505
They said if you did not bring me back,

503
00:36:43,145 --> 00:36:44,475
if you defied the Left State Councillor,

504
00:36:45,315 --> 00:36:47,085
your revenge for the Crown Princess...

505
00:36:47,685 --> 00:36:49,585
and your entire future would be ruined.

506
00:36:51,785 --> 00:36:55,655
I know how you must feel every single day when you wake.

507
00:36:56,255 --> 00:36:58,095
I know because I have lived that dream of yours.

508
00:36:59,195 --> 00:37:01,765
So how could I stand in the way of your future?

509
00:37:13,875 --> 00:37:14,875
Do not cry...

510
00:37:15,475 --> 00:37:16,475
with that face.

511
00:37:36,635 --> 00:37:37,865
I said, do not cry.

512
00:37:38,335 --> 00:37:39,465
I will handle this.

513
00:37:43,775 --> 00:37:44,835
So stop.

514
00:37:45,535 --> 00:37:47,475
- Okay?
- What do you mean?

515
00:37:48,475 --> 00:37:50,615
How are you going to handle it?

516
00:37:56,815 --> 00:37:57,955
A dogfight.

517
00:38:13,265 --> 00:38:14,405
Why are you here?

518
00:38:15,965 --> 00:38:17,035
What are you doing?

519
00:38:18,105 --> 00:38:19,945
I am here to take you to the Left State Councillor.

520
00:38:21,145 --> 00:38:22,145
What did you say?

521
00:38:30,355 --> 00:38:32,725
The resemblance is uncanny.

522
00:38:33,855 --> 00:38:37,395
What did I do that was so wrong?

523
00:38:38,495 --> 00:38:41,325
You are a woman that entered the palace posing as a eunuch.

524
00:38:41,495 --> 00:38:44,265
By the National Code, it is a crime of deceiving the Royal Court,

525
00:38:44,935 --> 00:38:48,205
punishable by over 100 floggings, exile, and hard labour.

526
00:38:48,605 --> 00:38:50,035
The law is certainly thorough, is it not?

527
00:38:52,205 --> 00:38:55,345
Fine. The law must be obeyed.

528
00:38:55,805 --> 00:38:57,575
Within these hallowed palace walls,

529
00:38:58,945 --> 00:39:00,585
I have committed a great deception.

530
00:39:02,115 --> 00:39:04,284
Since I will likely be beaten to death anyway,

531
00:39:04,285 --> 00:39:05,885
may I ask one question?

532
00:39:07,025 --> 00:39:10,755
What of a nobleman who forces himself on a woman he harassed?

533
00:39:11,555 --> 00:39:13,125
What punishment does he receive?

534
00:39:13,795 --> 00:39:17,035
What does the Great Ming Code of the National Code say about that?

535
00:39:18,095 --> 00:39:20,735
What does it say about that in there?

536
00:39:26,145 --> 00:39:28,375
According to the Great Ming Code, that is the crime of lewdness.

537
00:39:28,445 --> 00:39:31,975
If one forcibly harasses a woman or causes her sexual humiliation,

538
00:39:32,245 --> 00:39:36,315
he is punishable by 50 to 80 lashes or 80 to 100 floggings.

539
00:39:36,415 --> 00:39:39,485
Furthermore, a noble can be exiled or stripped of his position.

540
00:39:39,555 --> 00:39:42,925
If he is royalty or a high official, he could even be put to death.

541
00:39:44,155 --> 00:39:47,165
The Minister of Justice cannot even recall a simple law.

542
00:39:48,325 --> 00:39:50,695
Oh, my. Is that right?

543
00:39:51,395 --> 00:39:53,165
Then allow me to make an accusation.

544
00:39:54,305 --> 00:39:58,535
The Minister of Personnel over there harassed me before Donhwamun Gate,

545
00:39:58,675 --> 00:40:02,675
and he untied the sash of my blouse. I trust that poses no problem?

546
00:40:04,415 --> 00:40:07,185
What? That is absolute nonsense!

547
00:40:08,715 --> 00:40:11,285
Wait. You are that peddler!

548
00:40:15,555 --> 00:40:17,695
How are you going to handle it?

549
00:40:20,465 --> 00:40:21,465
A dogfight.

550
00:40:25,095 --> 00:40:26,135
I saw it.

551
00:40:26,835 --> 00:40:29,875
I saw it! With my own two eyes!

552
00:40:30,135 --> 00:40:32,605
Left State Councillor, that is not it. I mean...

553
00:40:32,675 --> 00:40:35,905
So the Minister of Personnel is quite the lecher.

554
00:40:36,375 --> 00:40:38,775
- So shameless.
- Says who, Minister of War?

555
00:40:39,345 --> 00:40:42,445
So the man in charge of provisions can just embezzle them?

556
00:40:42,785 --> 00:40:44,114
You call that honourable?

557
00:40:44,115 --> 00:40:47,125
Your potbelly is from the rations.

558
00:40:47,185 --> 00:40:49,284
What are you talking about?

559
00:40:49,285 --> 00:40:50,925
Minister of Finance is the one who stole them.

560
00:40:50,995 --> 00:40:52,865
I merely sold exemptions for military service...

561
00:40:54,025 --> 00:40:58,695
Why are you singling me out? Am I the only scoundrel here?

562
00:40:58,895 --> 00:41:03,475
I hear the Mayor of the Capital gambles away all his bribe money.

563
00:41:03,535 --> 00:41:05,004
You think gambling is a problem?

564
00:41:05,005 --> 00:41:07,775
It is better than taking bribes and handing them out to shamans.

565
00:41:08,005 --> 00:41:11,615
When Chief Scholar acts like this, it is a disgrace to our principles!

566
00:41:11,815 --> 00:41:13,515
Hey, that is...

567
00:41:23,295 --> 00:41:25,925
Are you all quite finished?

568
00:41:30,735 --> 00:41:34,135
Let he who is without sin among you cast the first stone.

569
00:41:34,535 --> 00:41:38,035
I guess she has a point.

570
00:41:38,635 --> 00:41:42,375
Indeed. This nation's vermin must be caught.

571
00:41:43,375 --> 00:41:46,885
I will expose every corrupt minister and see them punished.

572
00:41:47,445 --> 00:41:49,885
- Left State Councillor!
- Left State Councillor!

573
00:41:51,085 --> 00:41:52,155
However, Your Highness.

574
00:41:52,655 --> 00:41:56,085
For today, let us first punish Park Dal.

575
00:42:01,395 --> 00:42:03,765
If you are that concerned, I will make her a government slave...

576
00:42:04,335 --> 00:42:05,935
and spare her life.

577
00:42:07,135 --> 00:42:09,805
But 100 floggings is a death sentence.

578
00:42:10,075 --> 00:42:12,135
Instead, I will have her sent far away.

579
00:42:12,605 --> 00:42:15,045
Let us settle this by exiling her to Jeju as a government slave.

580
00:42:15,105 --> 00:42:17,475
Jeju? A government slave?

581
00:42:17,815 --> 00:42:19,344
This is better for you too.

582
00:42:19,345 --> 00:42:21,145
You are soon to become the King's in-law.

583
00:42:21,845 --> 00:42:23,454
If that girl is flogged to death,

584
00:42:23,455 --> 00:42:25,615
people will gossip about the Crown Princess Consort.

585
00:42:25,985 --> 00:42:28,085
Spare your daughter the humiliation.

586
00:42:28,925 --> 00:42:32,525
Your Highness, what do you mean? Jeju? A government slave?

587
00:42:32,755 --> 00:42:34,395
Give the order, Your Highness.

588
00:42:34,595 --> 00:42:37,565
You need to punish her yourself for the rumour to die down.

589
00:42:37,965 --> 00:42:38,965
Your Highness.

590
00:42:41,105 --> 00:42:42,665
Do not defy the Left State Councillor.

591
00:42:43,075 --> 00:42:45,305
Think of the Queen and my father-in-law who died for you,

592
00:42:45,775 --> 00:42:47,405
and your wife, the Crown Princess.

593
00:42:53,485 --> 00:42:54,485
Park...

594
00:42:56,455 --> 00:42:58,285
Park Dal...

595
00:42:59,285 --> 00:43:00,325
is to be exiled to Jeju...

596
00:43:01,625 --> 00:43:05,855
- as a government slave...
- Announcing the Queen Dowager.

597
00:43:25,145 --> 00:43:26,785
Release this girl.

598
00:43:27,115 --> 00:43:30,915
With respect, Your Majesty, this matter does not concern you.

599
00:43:31,115 --> 00:43:34,255
On the contrary. This is very much my concern.

600
00:43:34,625 --> 00:43:37,055
This girl is under my protection.

601
00:43:40,165 --> 00:43:41,225
Give that to me!

602
00:43:45,835 --> 00:43:46,835
What do you think you are doing?

603
00:43:49,265 --> 00:43:51,235
I have watched over His Highness since the day he was born.

604
00:43:51,605 --> 00:43:55,045
If someone died because of him, he could never live with himself.

605
00:43:55,505 --> 00:43:57,115
He does not have it in him to be that cruel.

606
00:43:57,445 --> 00:43:58,445
Let go of it!

607
00:43:59,815 --> 00:44:04,155
Go to the Queen Dowager with this, and make sure you survive.

608
00:44:04,785 --> 00:44:06,555
So His Highness does not have to carry that burden.

609
00:44:26,905 --> 00:44:28,445
Please save me, Your Majesty.

610
00:44:28,905 --> 00:44:32,115
I was the one who brought Park Dal into the palace as a eunuch.

611
00:44:32,615 --> 00:44:35,945
As a reward for saving His Highness at Sinjusa,

612
00:44:36,285 --> 00:44:37,955
I intended to make her a court lady,

613
00:44:38,755 --> 00:44:41,385
but I recalled the court ladies...

614
00:44:41,625 --> 00:44:43,155
wrongly cast out by the Chief Court Lady.

615
00:44:44,395 --> 00:44:46,565
This girl, who so resembles the deposed Crown Princess...

616
00:44:47,025 --> 00:44:51,935
It was clear she would be cast out, so I made a small arrangement.

617
00:44:52,495 --> 00:44:53,565
How...

618
00:44:54,235 --> 00:44:58,535
could a royal elder so brazenly break palace laws?

619
00:44:59,005 --> 00:45:00,005
The laws?

620
00:45:01,145 --> 00:45:02,175
Very well.

621
00:45:02,805 --> 00:45:05,945
That day, your daughter, before she was even wed,

622
00:45:06,245 --> 00:45:10,285
entered the Crown Prince's chambers without being announced.

623
00:45:10,685 --> 00:45:14,655
Then by those laws, your daughter, as well as the corrupt officials...

624
00:45:15,125 --> 00:45:17,055
should all be punished, should they not?

625
00:45:19,295 --> 00:45:23,195
Perhaps we should examine each offence...

626
00:45:24,395 --> 00:45:26,095
and make an issue of every single one?

627
00:45:41,385 --> 00:45:45,455
Your Majesty, I can never repay you for saving my life.

628
00:45:48,725 --> 00:45:49,855
As you should be.

629
00:45:50,395 --> 00:45:52,395
I have brought you in as a court lady for now,

630
00:45:52,755 --> 00:45:54,865
but you are to make her your royal concubine soon.

631
00:45:55,765 --> 00:45:56,765
Pardon?

632
00:46:00,165 --> 00:46:01,235
A royal concubine?

633
00:46:01,805 --> 00:46:03,005
That is preposterous.

634
00:46:03,065 --> 00:46:05,905
Preposterous? What on earth are you saying?

635
00:46:06,475 --> 00:46:08,645
I have not even married the Crown Princess yet.

636
00:46:08,945 --> 00:46:10,945
How can I possibly take a concubine before the wedding?

637
00:46:11,975 --> 00:46:14,185
Besides, this girl is merely a court lady.

638
00:46:14,785 --> 00:46:16,655
I fear I will incur His Majesty's wrath.

639
00:46:17,955 --> 00:46:20,685
For a man to be so full of fear...

640
00:46:21,925 --> 00:46:24,055
Was losing one Crown Princess not enough for you?

641
00:46:24,655 --> 00:46:27,395
Do you plan to let this girl die by the Left State Councillor too?

642
00:46:29,265 --> 00:46:31,395
I pity the late Crown Princess.

643
00:46:32,065 --> 00:46:35,405
To think she loved such a coward, only to die.

644
00:46:40,875 --> 00:46:43,575
Your Majesty, you have said more than enough.

645
00:46:44,775 --> 00:46:47,215
I may be an old woman pushed aside, but I am still...

646
00:46:47,985 --> 00:46:50,585
the head of the Inner Court of this nation.

647
00:46:51,815 --> 00:46:53,455
You will do as I say!

648
00:47:24,055 --> 00:47:25,215
Do you want to give it a try?

649
00:47:25,655 --> 00:47:29,685
It makes you feel all bubbly inside.

650
00:48:39,695 --> 00:48:40,965
What are you talking about?

651
00:48:41,365 --> 00:48:42,464
Are you saying it was not U Hui who started the rumours...

652
00:48:42,465 --> 00:48:43,535
about His Majesty?

653
00:48:43,635 --> 00:48:45,995
No, why are you suddenly bringing up the Crown Princess Consort?

654
00:48:46,435 --> 00:48:48,334
It was the Chief Court Lady's niece.

655
00:48:48,335 --> 00:48:50,475
Lady U Hui's maid, Yeo Ri, told me.

656
00:48:51,035 --> 00:48:52,035
Please give me that.

657
00:48:57,115 --> 00:49:00,345
From now on, let us never see each other again.

658
00:49:01,685 --> 00:49:04,815
Now, I find you repulsive.

659
00:49:07,355 --> 00:49:08,625
What have I done?

660
00:49:23,305 --> 00:49:26,375
The Queen Dowager is just too much.

661
00:49:27,205 --> 00:49:30,975
She demands the concubine position as if you were saving it for her.

662
00:49:32,515 --> 00:49:34,285
Because that is why she saved my life.

663
00:49:39,255 --> 00:49:40,884
The Left Flank Guard said...

664
00:49:40,885 --> 00:49:43,285
you threatened her with evidence of treason.

665
00:49:44,595 --> 00:49:47,595
Is there more to it? Come on. What did you say?

666
00:49:48,695 --> 00:49:52,465
Did you really think your threats would scare me?

667
00:49:52,765 --> 00:49:53,965
I had nothing to do with it.

668
00:49:54,435 --> 00:49:56,165
All I have to do is deny it, and that is that.

669
00:49:56,735 --> 00:49:59,975
If Your Majesty denies it, the world may be fooled.

670
00:50:00,175 --> 00:50:04,245
But you cannot fool yourself, can you, Your Majesty?

671
00:50:05,245 --> 00:50:07,345
I am not threatening you, Your Majesty.

672
00:50:07,945 --> 00:50:09,845
I am proving my usefulness to you.

673
00:50:11,455 --> 00:50:12,715
Do not just see this medicine bowl.

674
00:50:12,955 --> 00:50:15,085
See me, the one who brought it.

675
00:50:17,395 --> 00:50:20,195
For you to be in possession of something this important...

676
00:50:21,325 --> 00:50:25,865
means you have grown much closer to the Crown Prince. Is that it?

677
00:50:26,395 --> 00:50:27,405
Yes.

678
00:50:29,465 --> 00:50:31,075
Did the Crown Prince say so?

679
00:50:32,435 --> 00:50:36,105
Did he say he has feelings for you?

680
00:50:36,505 --> 00:50:38,615
He has not said it in so many words,

681
00:50:41,085 --> 00:50:42,485
but His Highness the Crown Prince...

682
00:50:43,785 --> 00:50:44,885
definitely loves Park Dal.

683
00:50:45,815 --> 00:50:46,925
That he loves her.

684
00:50:48,085 --> 00:50:50,855
That the Crown Prince loves Park Dal.

685
00:50:57,765 --> 00:51:02,065
She said he likes her enough to trust her with my secrets.

686
00:51:02,965 --> 00:51:04,435
And that they have even slept together?

687
00:51:05,205 --> 00:51:08,705
So why will he not make her his concubine?

688
00:51:09,705 --> 00:51:11,775
Perhaps it is because of that.

689
00:51:12,515 --> 00:51:16,245
- That?
- Young people play "push and pull."

690
00:51:16,785 --> 00:51:18,455
Why on earth would they be pulling a rope?

691
00:51:18,885 --> 00:51:22,255
Not a real rope. It is an emotional push and pull.

692
00:51:22,755 --> 00:51:25,395
They pretend to push the other away, but when they feel them slipping,

693
00:51:25,455 --> 00:51:28,665
they subtly pull them back in. A lover's game of push and pull.

694
00:51:29,425 --> 00:51:32,435
I did it to survive, okay? Just to survive.

695
00:51:32,995 --> 00:51:34,965
When your life is on the line, you will do anything.

696
00:51:35,135 --> 00:51:37,335
Hey, I am not judging.

697
00:51:38,075 --> 00:51:40,135
You either like them or you do not.

698
00:51:40,245 --> 00:51:42,305
Why all this wishy-washy nonsense?

699
00:51:43,675 --> 00:51:47,244
Kids these days, honestly.

700
00:51:47,245 --> 00:51:49,885
It is because they have never had to struggle.

701
00:51:52,555 --> 00:51:55,155
Wait, so if I do not become a concubine,

702
00:51:55,485 --> 00:51:57,555
the Queen Dowager will...

703
00:51:58,425 --> 00:51:59,655
She might kill you.

704
00:52:01,895 --> 00:52:02,895
I see.

705
00:52:07,535 --> 00:52:10,105
And here I thought I was the one who needed consoling.

706
00:52:10,235 --> 00:52:11,804
Between the Crown Princess Consort, the Left State Councillor,

707
00:52:11,805 --> 00:52:13,375
and the Queen Dowager.

708
00:52:13,705 --> 00:52:15,105
Talk about a minefield.

709
00:52:15,675 --> 00:52:18,045
And right now, I am the one who has to dodge them.

710
00:52:22,245 --> 00:52:23,285
Your Highness.

711
00:52:23,785 --> 00:52:26,054
Do not go ahead with this Royal Wedding.

712
00:52:26,055 --> 00:52:27,285
Do not worry.

713
00:52:28,455 --> 00:52:30,595
We will probably be back in our bodies before the wedding.

714
00:52:32,595 --> 00:52:34,765
We have to be back before then.

715
00:52:36,895 --> 00:52:38,935
Even if we switch back, do not go through with this marriage!

716
00:52:42,205 --> 00:52:43,465
What are you saying?

717
00:52:43,535 --> 00:52:46,335
Marrying the woman who shot you makes no sense,

718
00:52:46,405 --> 00:52:48,545
and it is absurd that I am in danger because of it.

719
00:52:48,745 --> 00:52:52,045
The whole thing is absurd, so call off the Royal Wedding.

720
00:52:58,155 --> 00:52:59,585
If I call off this marriage,

721
00:53:00,885 --> 00:53:02,555
the Left State Councillor will have me killed.

722
00:53:02,855 --> 00:53:03,895
You know what they say.

723
00:53:05,095 --> 00:53:07,665
They say the best defence is a good offence.

724
00:53:10,435 --> 00:53:12,035
You must take him out before he takes you out.

725
00:53:12,765 --> 00:53:15,735
Why are you suddenly staring like that?

726
00:53:15,905 --> 00:53:18,675
The Gyesa Year Incident, Your Highness's revenge.

727
00:53:19,835 --> 00:53:21,105
I want in on it.

728
00:53:22,805 --> 00:53:24,675
Since your body is mine right now,

729
00:53:25,015 --> 00:53:28,245
that means half of this revenge is mine as well.

730
00:53:34,855 --> 00:53:37,895
As you ordered, I looked into the girl, Park Dal.

731
00:53:38,325 --> 00:53:40,295
The Park family's inn in Boryeong has closed down,

732
00:53:40,825 --> 00:53:43,465
and the innkeeper and the family have vanished without a trace.

733
00:53:43,895 --> 00:53:45,135
Is this the Crown Prince's doing?

734
00:53:45,495 --> 00:53:46,495
Well,

735
00:53:47,235 --> 00:53:49,335
it seems Lord Heo Ok was behind it.

736
00:53:50,775 --> 00:53:51,905
Ok was? Why?

737
00:53:51,975 --> 00:53:55,775
Apparently, Park Dal is Lord Heo's niece by marriage.

738
00:53:57,215 --> 00:53:59,145
After losing her parents, she was struggling to get by,

739
00:53:59,775 --> 00:54:03,315
so Lord Heo set her up as a peddler at the Boryeong inn.

740
00:54:18,865 --> 00:54:20,505
What is the meaning of this?

741
00:54:22,005 --> 00:54:23,305
Thank you, my lord.

742
00:54:24,075 --> 00:54:26,875
We must keep him in a gilded cage until he is old enough.

743
00:54:28,305 --> 00:54:29,305
I will take my leave.

744
00:54:40,555 --> 00:54:42,425
There is something I need to confirm,

745
00:54:42,885 --> 00:54:44,595
so I will need you to take care of something for me.

746
00:54:55,665 --> 00:54:58,505
I really wish you would not go. It is too dangerous.

747
00:55:01,045 --> 00:55:04,045
Come on, we have no idea when we will get our bodies back.

748
00:55:04,345 --> 00:55:06,475
And I cannot just sit on my hands and wait.

749
00:55:06,975 --> 00:55:08,015
But still.

750
00:55:08,185 --> 00:55:11,555
By the way, why take revenge at a courtesan house?

751
00:55:11,955 --> 00:55:14,755
The Crown Prince, a fool who frequents courtesan houses.

752
00:55:15,685 --> 00:55:18,595
What better cover is there to fool the Left State Councillor?

753
00:55:18,655 --> 00:55:20,495
Gosh, my hands just will not listen to me.

754
00:55:20,665 --> 00:55:21,695
Oh, there you go.

755
00:55:28,635 --> 00:55:30,005
There are no holes...

756
00:55:30,935 --> 00:55:33,745
in the cover I created. Got it?

757
00:55:38,015 --> 00:55:39,275
Honestly, you are so clumsy.

758
00:56:12,645 --> 00:56:13,645
There. All done.

759
00:56:22,425 --> 00:56:23,425
What is it?

760
00:56:24,025 --> 00:56:25,025
What?

761
00:56:28,395 --> 00:56:29,725
Watch the corner behind you.

762
00:56:34,965 --> 00:56:36,065
Your Highness.

763
00:56:37,175 --> 00:56:38,305
Your Highness.

764
00:56:38,605 --> 00:56:40,645
Your Highness... You gave me such a fright.

765
00:56:41,305 --> 00:56:44,915
Why am I always the one to see this? Why me?

766
00:56:44,975 --> 00:56:46,775
It is so annoying!

767
00:56:47,045 --> 00:56:49,985
- So frustrating!
- Se Dol.

768
00:56:50,045 --> 00:56:51,754
It is not what it looks like.

769
00:56:51,755 --> 00:56:53,615
Se Dol.

770
00:56:53,955 --> 00:56:55,725
Of all the times for that jerk to walk in...

771
00:56:58,625 --> 00:56:59,625
Your Highness.

772
00:56:59,995 --> 00:57:01,425
I do not think we can go out today.

773
00:57:01,595 --> 00:57:02,765
What are you talking about?

774
00:57:02,795 --> 00:57:04,435
Grand Prince Je Un is apparently sick.

775
00:57:08,905 --> 00:57:12,535
My lord, you cannot avoid this forever.

776
00:57:14,075 --> 00:57:16,375
The Royal Wedding is less than 50 days away,

777
00:57:17,345 --> 00:57:19,375
so do you not think it will be fine if I just wait until then?

778
00:57:26,085 --> 00:57:29,825
But why is Grand Prince Je Un seeking revenge?

779
00:57:29,855 --> 00:57:31,395
Especially when he is in love with the Crown Princess Consort?

780
00:57:31,695 --> 00:57:34,224
The Left State Councillor spread a rumour that Je Un's mother,

781
00:57:34,225 --> 00:57:35,695
who died after being falsely accused of adultery,

782
00:57:36,025 --> 00:57:39,935
that her vengeful spirit caused the Gyesa Year Incident.

783
00:57:40,095 --> 00:57:41,835
All to cover up the death by Jimjo Poison.

784
00:57:42,205 --> 00:57:44,335
That scumbag went after his family?

785
00:57:45,505 --> 00:57:46,705
Goodness.

786
00:57:46,735 --> 00:57:49,675
Poor Grand Prince Je Un. How devastated he must be.

787
00:57:50,775 --> 00:57:52,444
Hey, have you ever felt that bad for me...

788
00:57:52,445 --> 00:57:53,615
and what I have been through?

789
00:57:54,015 --> 00:57:56,945
Is his pain all that matters? What about mine?

790
00:57:58,455 --> 00:58:01,355
I do. Every single night. In my dreams.

791
00:58:10,865 --> 00:58:12,165
But a life where I wear silk shoes...

792
00:58:12,535 --> 00:58:14,065
and walk at a leisurely pace.

793
00:58:14,335 --> 00:58:15,365
That is the life I want.

794
00:58:24,415 --> 00:58:25,675
Welcome.

795
00:58:26,015 --> 00:58:27,015
This one...

796
00:58:28,415 --> 00:58:30,955
This one is pretty too. I will take this one and this one.

797
00:58:45,595 --> 00:58:49,835
- You look so beautiful dressed up.
- Totally.

798
00:58:51,875 --> 00:58:54,505
Goodness. What is this?

799
00:58:55,375 --> 00:58:58,315
When I am all dressed up like this,

800
00:58:58,345 --> 00:59:00,415
I look like a young lady from a noble family.

801
00:59:01,485 --> 00:59:02,685
How beautiful.

802
00:59:05,555 --> 00:59:06,615
Take a good look.

803
00:59:14,625 --> 00:59:16,365
See just how lovely you are.

804
00:59:16,925 --> 00:59:18,535
And how precious you are.

805
00:59:28,575 --> 00:59:29,875
So from now on,

806
00:59:30,175 --> 00:59:33,945
all that talk of being a slave and putting others first.

807
00:59:34,385 --> 00:59:36,715
Do not think like that. Got it?

808
00:59:39,355 --> 00:59:41,725
Oh, my goodness.

809
00:59:42,155 --> 00:59:46,055
You look so beautiful today. You should have a portrait painted.

810
00:59:46,225 --> 00:59:48,694
My brother is painting out front.

811
00:59:48,695 --> 00:59:50,795
You have no idea how good he is.

812
00:59:50,835 --> 00:59:52,465
And since you bought so many clothes today,

813
00:59:52,535 --> 00:59:55,865
just for you, I will give you 30 percent off.

814
01:00:00,105 --> 01:00:02,405
It is not like it is free or anything.

815
01:00:02,945 --> 01:00:05,775
- It is fine. Let us just go.
- No, let us do it.

816
01:00:06,175 --> 01:00:07,915
I do look pretty today, you know.

817
01:00:09,015 --> 01:00:10,915
Great! Right this way.

818
01:00:10,985 --> 01:00:12,985
(Four Frames of Life)

819
01:00:17,155 --> 01:00:18,425
What are you two doing?

820
01:00:18,625 --> 01:00:20,525
- What?
- Scooch in a little closer now.

821
01:00:24,235 --> 01:00:25,435
Can we not just...

822
01:00:26,235 --> 01:00:27,335
Just draw us like this.

823
01:00:27,965 --> 01:00:31,175
Come on, now. The paper is too small for that.

824
01:00:31,235 --> 01:00:33,535
What does the size of the paper have to do with anything?

825
01:00:34,605 --> 01:00:37,045
He said the paper is too small.

826
01:00:38,475 --> 01:00:39,675
What can you do?

827
01:00:40,175 --> 01:00:42,584
Right? If the paper is small...

828
01:00:42,585 --> 01:00:44,615
Since the paper is small...

829
01:00:48,585 --> 01:00:51,095
All right, I am starting now. This will be quick.

830
01:01:02,105 --> 01:01:03,535
Okay, second pose.

831
01:01:09,275 --> 01:01:10,475
My goodness, you two...

832
01:01:10,975 --> 01:01:12,675
are quite awkward.

833
01:01:13,345 --> 01:01:14,415
Here I go.

834
01:01:14,945 --> 01:01:16,385
Hold still.

835
01:01:21,025 --> 01:01:23,755
How about a big smile for pose three from you, my lady?

836
01:01:23,955 --> 01:01:26,595
Me? I am not usually one to get nervous.

837
01:01:26,655 --> 01:01:29,165
- Okay.
- He meant me.

838
01:01:30,165 --> 01:01:32,665
What are you on about? Come on, big smile!

839
01:01:33,595 --> 01:01:35,635
Oh, my, so pretty.

840
01:01:36,735 --> 01:01:38,935
You are even prettier when you smile.

841
01:01:40,475 --> 01:01:43,145
All right, for the last one, big smiles from both of you!

842
01:01:54,385 --> 01:01:55,425
How pretty.

843
01:01:56,225 --> 01:01:58,825
It is a spitting image of you.

844
01:02:01,195 --> 01:02:02,665
Gosh, excuse me.

845
01:02:07,395 --> 01:02:09,205
Such a nice scent. It is a delight to the nose.

846
01:02:10,535 --> 01:02:13,505
- You are being so dramatic.
- Smell it and tell me I am wrong.

847
01:02:27,955 --> 01:02:29,425
You were not being dramatic.

848
01:02:29,655 --> 01:02:32,425
I... I know, right?

849
01:02:35,565 --> 01:02:38,465
Gosh. What kind of incense smells this good?

850
01:02:39,595 --> 01:02:40,905
Gosh.

851
01:02:40,935 --> 01:02:43,565
That scent is a killer.

852
01:02:44,135 --> 01:02:45,975
You are not selling anything harmful, are you?

853
01:02:46,635 --> 01:02:48,475
No, of course not.

854
01:02:48,675 --> 01:02:50,975
It is just an occupational hazard for an incense maker.

855
01:02:51,315 --> 01:02:54,345
From smelling strong incense and inhaling smoke every day,

856
01:02:54,385 --> 01:02:56,515
it is bound to ruin one's lungs.

857
01:02:57,985 --> 01:03:02,055
But why would you keep doing this, even if it is ruining your health?

858
01:03:02,355 --> 01:03:04,085
Are you struggling that much financially?

859
01:03:04,125 --> 01:03:08,425
No. Who would risk their last breath just to put food on the table?

860
01:03:08,595 --> 01:03:10,365
We do it simply because we love it.

861
01:03:10,725 --> 01:03:13,795
My wife stays because she loves the incense,

862
01:03:14,305 --> 01:03:17,805
and I stay by her side because I love her.

863
01:03:19,335 --> 01:03:22,505
We have lived this way for 40 years now.

864
01:03:22,845 --> 01:03:26,245
A husband protects his wife's dream. What else is he to do?

865
01:03:26,675 --> 01:03:28,045
He protects them because he loves her.

866
01:03:28,785 --> 01:03:30,785
What other choice is there?

867
01:03:45,995 --> 01:03:47,495
What is this?

868
01:03:48,935 --> 01:03:50,035
It is so pretty.

869
01:03:50,535 --> 01:03:52,105
Hey, look at this.

870
01:04:12,655 --> 01:04:15,525
Come on. That is from the ground. It is filthy.

871
01:04:15,925 --> 01:04:19,535
- Filthy? It is beautiful.
- Beautiful, my foot.

872
01:04:20,495 --> 01:04:23,335
Spring may melt the snow away, but flower petals...

873
01:04:26,235 --> 01:04:27,575
have to be cleaned up by people.

874
01:04:28,175 --> 01:04:30,075
It all costs money and manpower.

875
01:04:31,845 --> 01:04:33,115
What has gotten into you?

876
01:04:33,375 --> 01:04:36,115
But seeing the petals piled up makes me happy.

877
01:04:37,615 --> 01:04:40,055
The petals are piling up, not you. Why are you happy?

878
01:04:40,115 --> 01:04:43,585
Like mighty oaks from little acorns, happiness grows from little piles.

879
01:04:44,495 --> 01:04:48,195
"Gently piling up" sounds like small blessings piling up...

880
01:04:48,365 --> 01:04:50,264
like a promise of happiness.

881
01:04:50,265 --> 01:04:51,695
Does it not feel that way to you?

882
01:05:15,225 --> 01:05:16,225
My dear.

883
01:05:44,815 --> 01:05:48,125
They say this scent is supposed to help you sleep.

884
01:05:48,425 --> 01:05:49,685
I wanted to thank you for everything.

885
01:06:08,675 --> 01:06:10,175
You head back to the palace first.

886
01:06:54,485 --> 01:06:55,755
What were you doing?

887
01:06:55,985 --> 01:06:58,455
I was listening to the sound of the snow falling.

888
01:06:59,195 --> 01:07:00,495
Gently piling up.

889
01:07:00,895 --> 01:07:03,525
It is as if little blessings are piling up like snow.

890
01:07:04,225 --> 01:07:06,495
Does it not feel like a promise of happiness?

891
01:07:12,605 --> 01:07:13,775
Here, give me your hand.

892
01:07:26,685 --> 01:07:27,685
Here.

893
01:07:28,355 --> 01:07:30,125
Your small blessing for today.

894
01:07:40,165 --> 01:07:41,765
It is so beautiful.

895
01:07:44,365 --> 01:07:45,575
Truly.

896
01:07:52,575 --> 01:07:54,845
I smiled at another woman.

897
01:07:56,515 --> 01:07:58,085
I even dared to feel happy.

898
01:07:59,815 --> 01:08:01,015
How shameless of me.

899
01:08:06,955 --> 01:08:09,365
Please just blame it on how much she looks like you...

900
01:08:13,065 --> 01:08:14,765
and find it in your heart to forgive me.

901
01:08:39,925 --> 01:08:41,225
What is this?

902
01:08:42,925 --> 01:08:44,125
Why are you doing this?

903
01:08:44,465 --> 01:08:46,395
Untie me!

904
01:08:47,535 --> 01:08:48,805
Do not waste your strength.

905
01:08:49,305 --> 01:08:51,105
The drug has not worn off yet.

906
01:08:51,935 --> 01:08:53,175
Was it the Left State Councillor?

907
01:08:55,445 --> 01:08:57,445
The Left State Councillor ordered you to kill me?

908
01:08:57,605 --> 01:08:59,415
I wish that were the case,

909
01:08:59,675 --> 01:09:01,145
but he needs something confirmed.

910
01:09:01,245 --> 01:09:03,985
Today, I will only leave a subtle mark.

911
01:09:06,915 --> 01:09:08,055
This medicine will make you barren.

912
01:09:08,355 --> 01:09:11,085
Your only use is to conceive the Grand Heir.

913
01:09:11,555 --> 01:09:15,595
Once you are of no use, the Queen Dowager will kill you.

914
01:09:18,965 --> 01:09:20,665
No! Let me go!

915
01:09:21,195 --> 01:09:24,265
Let me go! No! Let go of me!

916
01:09:24,675 --> 01:09:27,205
Let me go! Let go!

917
01:09:33,315 --> 01:09:34,915
Flower shoes on the likes of you?

918
01:09:35,685 --> 01:09:36,745
Burn them.

919
01:09:44,355 --> 01:09:45,795
"Dream" is...

920
01:09:46,555 --> 01:09:47,825
too grand a word for it.

921
01:09:49,495 --> 01:09:50,965
Other than straw shoes,

922
01:09:51,865 --> 01:09:53,295
I want one in silk shoes.

923
01:09:53,835 --> 01:09:57,165
Where I do not have to run anymore. A life where I can settle down...

924
01:09:58,505 --> 01:10:00,305
and make a real family of my own.

925
01:10:06,415 --> 01:10:07,415
How dare you...

926
01:10:12,085 --> 01:10:13,085
How dare you!

927
01:10:23,225 --> 01:10:25,735
What are you standing around for? Seize her!

928
01:10:37,345 --> 01:10:38,445
You wretched girl!

929
01:10:47,455 --> 01:10:48,555
That wench...

930
01:11:02,565 --> 01:11:04,265
That vicious wench.

931
01:11:04,935 --> 01:11:06,375
She put her bare hands into the brazier...

932
01:11:06,705 --> 01:11:08,045
for a pair of flower shoes.

933
01:11:36,065 --> 01:11:37,205
Not here.

934
01:11:39,505 --> 01:11:40,575
If I am going to collapse,

935
01:11:43,175 --> 01:11:44,945
I have to do it somewhere safe.

936
01:11:56,485 --> 01:12:00,095
Even a street hustler's shell game is not this confusing.

937
01:12:00,295 --> 01:12:01,895
One moment, he is a warm spring breeze,

938
01:12:01,965 --> 01:12:03,995
and the next, an icy gust of wind.

939
01:12:04,565 --> 01:12:05,965
It is just not fair for me. Am I wrong?

940
01:12:07,165 --> 01:12:08,664
Are you tired of me too?

941
01:12:08,665 --> 01:12:10,335
Are you giving me the cold shoulder now?

942
01:12:10,435 --> 01:12:12,805
Where are you going? I am not finished!

943
01:12:13,175 --> 01:12:15,105
Mangdeok.

944
01:12:16,175 --> 01:12:17,375
Mangdeok!

945
01:12:18,215 --> 01:12:19,345
Mangdeok!

946
01:12:22,585 --> 01:12:23,585
Mangdeok!

947
01:12:24,645 --> 01:12:25,685
Mangdeok.

948
01:12:27,615 --> 01:12:29,025
Where are you going?

949
01:12:37,565 --> 01:12:38,764
Mangdeok.

950
01:12:38,765 --> 01:12:39,835
You startled me.

951
01:12:43,935 --> 01:12:45,005
Your Highness?

952
01:12:48,805 --> 01:12:49,845
Your Highness!

953
01:12:51,175 --> 01:12:54,215
What on earth happened to you?

954
01:12:54,315 --> 01:12:55,985
Why are you not wearing your flower shoes...

955
01:12:56,315 --> 01:12:57,785
but clutching them like a treasure?

956
01:12:59,615 --> 01:13:00,915
Goodness.

957
01:13:00,955 --> 01:13:03,025
And you are barefoot.

958
01:13:03,455 --> 01:13:04,525
For goodness' sake.

959
01:13:05,625 --> 01:13:07,695
And what happened to your hands?

960
01:13:14,835 --> 01:13:16,765
Was not wearing flower shoes your dream?

961
01:13:17,465 --> 01:13:19,805
Why are you suddenly going on about the flower shoes?

962
01:13:22,075 --> 01:13:25,515
A husband protects his wife's dream. What else is he to do?

963
01:13:25,915 --> 01:13:27,375
He protects them because he loves her.

964
01:13:27,715 --> 01:13:29,645
What other choice is there?

965
01:13:31,115 --> 01:13:32,155
You...

966
01:13:33,555 --> 01:13:34,755
wear your flower shoes.

967
01:13:36,825 --> 01:13:38,355
I will be the one...

968
01:13:39,355 --> 01:13:40,595
running barefoot.

969
01:13:43,125 --> 01:13:44,395
What are you...

970
01:13:49,035 --> 01:13:50,035
From now on,

971
01:13:53,205 --> 01:13:54,945
I cannot look the other way anymore.

972
01:14:09,755 --> 01:14:10,885
Your Highness.

973
01:14:11,655 --> 01:14:14,095
Your Highness.

974
01:14:18,965 --> 01:14:20,295
Your Highness.

975
01:14:23,005 --> 01:14:25,535
This girl now inhabits my body,

976
01:14:28,575 --> 01:14:29,805
and in my heart,

977
01:14:32,875 --> 01:14:34,075
the moon flows.

978
01:14:41,215 --> 01:14:46,295
(Moon River)

979
01:15:01,845 --> 01:15:04,475
What am I going to do? Please wake up!

980
01:15:05,075 --> 01:15:08,245
This must be why we switched bodies. So I would be hurt instead of you.

981
01:15:08,315 --> 01:15:11,084
Her uncanny resemblance of the deceased Crown Princess.

982
01:15:11,085 --> 01:15:12,185
It is unsettling.

983
01:15:12,485 --> 01:15:16,455
- Get rid of her.
- His Highness cannot protect Dal.

984
01:15:16,585 --> 01:15:20,725
From now on, I am your shield. And you will hide behind me.

985
01:15:20,955 --> 01:15:24,825
When you keep acting like this, you make me hope for the impossible.

986
01:15:25,165 --> 01:15:26,565
Your Highness, do you have feelings for me?

987
01:15:42,915 --> 01:15:47,485
(Moon River)
