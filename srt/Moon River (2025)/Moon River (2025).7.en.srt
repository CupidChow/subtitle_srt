1
00:00:09,110 --> 00:00:10,350
(All people, incidents, and backgrounds...)

2
00:00:10,420 --> 00:00:11,650
(in this drama are fictitious and unrelated to reality.)

3
00:00:11,720 --> 00:00:13,020
(Also, children and animals were filmed under production guidelines.)

4
00:00:14,250 --> 00:00:15,250
You...

5
00:00:16,650 --> 00:00:18,020
wear your flower shoes.

6
00:00:19,960 --> 00:00:21,490
I will be the one...

7
00:00:22,490 --> 00:00:23,660
running barefoot.

8
00:00:26,260 --> 00:00:27,430
What are you...

9
00:00:31,640 --> 00:00:32,640
From now on,

10
00:00:35,910 --> 00:00:37,680
I cannot look the other way anymore.

11
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:52,760
Your Royal Highness.

12
00:00:55,460 --> 00:00:56,960
Your Royal Highness.

13
00:00:58,730 --> 00:00:59,800
Your Royal Highness.

14
00:01:01,530 --> 00:01:04,270
Oh, no. Please wake up.

15
00:01:05,340 --> 00:01:07,310
- Your Royal Highness.
- Your Royal Highness.

16
00:01:08,570 --> 00:01:09,570
Hurry.

17
00:01:15,480 --> 00:01:17,110
Please examine her closely.

18
00:01:18,550 --> 00:01:21,450
His pulse is normal, so you need not worry.

19
00:01:22,620 --> 00:01:23,690
But over here...

20
00:01:23,990 --> 00:01:25,560
What? What is it?

21
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:30,700
- It seems there is drug on it.
- What? Drug?

22
00:01:33,030 --> 00:01:34,730
If it is drug, could it be...

23
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,130
Poison?

24
00:01:38,300 --> 00:01:40,170
She has simply fainted from exhaustion.

25
00:01:40,540 --> 00:01:43,110
I understand. You may go now.

26
00:01:59,990 --> 00:02:01,190
Are you awake now?

27
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:13,970
- How did I end up here?
- What?

28
00:02:14,810 --> 00:02:16,570
I was going to ask you the same thing when you got up.

29
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:18,740
What am I supposed to do if you cannot remember?

30
00:02:19,480 --> 00:02:23,210
Explain. We were having fun, and then you suddenly stormed off.

31
00:02:23,310 --> 00:02:26,520
Why were you out running at night just to collapse?

32
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:32,359
Let me go! No! Let go of me!

33
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:34,560
Let me go! Let go!

34
00:02:35,460 --> 00:02:37,860
The Left State Councillor will surely harm Dal.

35
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:41,100
I can protect her somehow while our bodies are swapped,

36
00:02:41,830 --> 00:02:43,130
but once we switch back...

37
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:45,700
Darn it.

38
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,000
What?

39
00:02:49,710 --> 00:02:52,680
If you will not talk, then do not. Why suddenly curse?

40
00:02:53,810 --> 00:02:55,580
Where are you going? You have not even recovered yet.

41
00:02:58,250 --> 00:02:59,380
There is only one way.

42
00:02:59,820 --> 00:03:01,220
Between protecting her and just standing by,

43
00:03:01,550 --> 00:03:02,890
I must stand in between.

44
00:03:03,350 --> 00:03:04,820
I have no choice but to stand there and be a coward.

45
00:03:07,530 --> 00:03:09,330
This must be why our bodies switched.

46
00:03:10,630 --> 00:03:11,960
So I would get hurt instead of you.

47
00:03:14,130 --> 00:03:16,170
So I would experience all this humiliation myself.

48
00:03:16,830 --> 00:03:19,000
I am never to escape the guilt I feel toward the Crown Princess.

49
00:03:20,710 --> 00:03:23,110
You will never know how this feels, will you?

50
00:03:25,110 --> 00:03:26,140
So...

51
00:03:27,110 --> 00:03:28,950
when we switch back, leave without a moment's hesitation.

52
00:03:29,310 --> 00:03:31,020
And never set foot in Hanyang again.

53
00:03:41,060 --> 00:03:42,829
(Mangdeok)

54
00:03:42,830 --> 00:03:43,930
Are you kidding me?

55
00:03:44,230 --> 00:03:46,900
He thinks only he is feeling awful, while I am on top of the world?

56
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,300
So only his pride gets hurt? You think mine is still perfect?

57
00:03:53,170 --> 00:03:54,170
Unbelievable.

58
00:03:56,140 --> 00:03:57,210
This is lousy.

59
00:04:15,860 --> 00:04:17,630
How utterly cowardly of me.

60
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:22,730
Even though I know I am the reason for all this danger,

61
00:04:24,900 --> 00:04:26,770
and yet, all I have done is hurt her.

62
00:04:27,870 --> 00:04:31,040
Can a girl get some sleep? What is your problem every night?

63
00:04:31,110 --> 00:04:33,080
How insolent! How dare you...

64
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:45,420
I have to dodge the wooden pillow.

65
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:47,120
Dodging is the best option.

66
00:04:54,530 --> 00:04:56,030
Why does it have to be the moon again?

67
00:05:03,170 --> 00:05:04,180
Right.

68
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:06,280
Avoidance is the best strategy.

69
00:05:07,550 --> 00:05:08,980
Hiding is the best strategy.

70
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:22,860
Good thing the Left State Councillor is out of the capital.

71
00:05:23,390 --> 00:05:25,060
If he finds out we failed today,

72
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:27,000
I am a dead woman.

73
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:31,870
About that girl, Park Dal,

74
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:33,700
bring me whatever you can find on her.

75
00:05:45,150 --> 00:05:49,190
Your Royal Highness. Queen Dowager is looking for you.

76
00:05:51,390 --> 00:05:52,660
Tell her I am busy.

77
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:55,830
All she will do is lecture me about choosing a Royal Concubine.

78
00:05:56,260 --> 00:05:58,529
She will slam the desk in the end.

79
00:05:58,530 --> 00:06:00,260
What is it with these nobles...

80
00:06:00,330 --> 00:06:02,000
and their obsession with slamming desks?

81
00:06:02,270 --> 00:06:05,300
What did the desk ever do to them? Honestly.

82
00:06:07,170 --> 00:06:08,470
An infertility potion?

83
00:06:11,640 --> 00:06:14,080
So the Left State Councillor has finally crossed the line.

84
00:06:14,980 --> 00:06:17,050
According to my spy with the Chief Court Lady,

85
00:06:17,310 --> 00:06:20,250
Park Dal refused to drink the infertility potion to the end...

86
00:06:20,350 --> 00:06:23,790
- and fought off ten court ladies.
- She fought back?

87
00:06:27,190 --> 00:06:29,390
The more I hear about her, the more I like her.

88
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:34,700
Yes. To be one of my people, one must have that kind of spirit.

89
00:06:36,130 --> 00:06:38,370
It seems the Chief Court Lady is about to make another move.

90
00:06:38,740 --> 00:06:39,870
What are your orders?

91
00:06:42,270 --> 00:06:44,069
If the Crown Prince is not a fool,

92
00:06:44,070 --> 00:06:45,640
he will know that appointing a Royal Concubine...

93
00:06:45,780 --> 00:06:48,010
is his only shield.

94
00:06:48,550 --> 00:06:51,320
If he gives me even the slightest excuse,

95
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:53,150
I am issuing the appointment on the spot.

96
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:06,660
This must be why our bodies switched.

97
00:07:07,330 --> 00:07:08,730
So I would get hurt instead of you.

98
00:07:11,100 --> 00:07:13,200
So I would experience all this humiliation myself.

99
00:07:16,840 --> 00:07:19,480
I am never to escape the guilt I feel toward the Crown Princess.

100
00:07:22,710 --> 00:07:25,850
I cannot eat with so many eyes on me.

101
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:29,190
One court lady may stay. The rest of you are dismissed.

102
00:07:40,260 --> 00:07:41,330
Wait.

103
00:07:41,930 --> 00:07:44,170
Where is Dal? Why is she...

104
00:07:47,610 --> 00:07:49,509
Dal was sent to help prepare for your wedding...

105
00:07:49,510 --> 00:07:50,980
at the Office of Royal Wedding Rites.

106
00:07:58,850 --> 00:07:59,880
I am not eating.

107
00:08:00,990 --> 00:08:02,020
Take it away.

108
00:08:14,730 --> 00:08:15,730
Crown Prince.

109
00:08:20,300 --> 00:08:24,780
Hide well or I will see your hair

110
00:08:24,910 --> 00:08:29,150
Hide well or I will see your rear

111
00:08:29,210 --> 00:08:33,420
Where are you hiding? Behind a tree there?

112
00:08:33,620 --> 00:08:37,590
Hold in your laughter, if you dare

113
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:41,930
Hide well or I will see your hair

114
00:08:42,230 --> 00:08:43,660
- Your Royal Highness!
- Your Royal Highness!

115
00:08:59,940 --> 00:09:01,080
Crown Prince.

116
00:09:06,920 --> 00:09:08,920
What? His Majesty the King?

117
00:09:10,190 --> 00:09:12,290
Then I must go at once.

118
00:09:13,160 --> 00:09:15,060
Crown Prince.

119
00:09:15,630 --> 00:09:17,160
Darn it. That little brat.

120
00:09:23,670 --> 00:09:26,300
Announcing His Royal Highness, the Crown Prince.

121
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:50,460
(Chapter Seven: Hide-and-Seek)

122
00:09:50,690 --> 00:09:52,199
It is not like I am going to eat him up.

123
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:53,500
Why is he avoiding me? Why?

124
00:09:54,300 --> 00:09:55,429
- Well...
- Why is Prince Je Un...

125
00:09:55,430 --> 00:09:56,600
not getting better?

126
00:09:57,670 --> 00:10:01,170
He is a nobleman with every comfort. Why is he not recovering?

127
00:10:01,310 --> 00:10:02,340
Darn it.

128
00:10:02,710 --> 00:10:04,940
What about the talks for the Gyesa Year Incident?

129
00:10:05,210 --> 00:10:08,280
If you are that concerned, why not send the Royal Physician?

130
00:10:10,910 --> 00:10:12,880
- I can do that?
- Yes.

131
00:10:14,950 --> 00:10:17,120
Why would he suddenly send the Royal Physician?

132
00:10:17,590 --> 00:10:19,890
You do not think he has realised you are faking it, do you?

133
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:21,860
No, I do not think that is it.

134
00:10:22,290 --> 00:10:25,200
But it is clear he wants to resolve the Gyesa Year Incident quickly.

135
00:10:28,070 --> 00:10:31,240
In this situation, if he finds out about the boy from Qing...

136
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:35,040
He will charge full steam ahead. What else can we do but run for it?

137
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:38,540
That boy from Qing is running wild, demanding immediate revenge.

138
00:10:39,810 --> 00:10:43,150
Do not follow me today. I need you to watch him closely.

139
00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:44,480
Yes, sir.

140
00:10:54,190 --> 00:10:57,060
Please. If I can just hold out until the Royal Wedding,

141
00:10:57,360 --> 00:10:59,800
I can stop U Hui from being enslaved.

142
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:04,230
Even if it makes me a coward, there is no other way.

143
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:46,510
I will be off then.

144
00:11:47,780 --> 00:11:49,109
You cannot get out of it this time.

145
00:11:49,110 --> 00:11:51,350
They say Prince Je Un is fully recovered.

146
00:11:52,950 --> 00:11:55,950
Right. Who knows when our bodies will switch back?

147
00:11:56,190 --> 00:11:58,090
I cannot just keep putting off my revenge.

148
00:11:58,990 --> 00:12:00,020
All right.

149
00:12:00,620 --> 00:12:01,630
Let us go.

150
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:19,180
There are no holes in the cover I created. Got it?

151
00:12:29,250 --> 00:12:30,290
Tie this for me.

152
00:12:36,260 --> 00:12:37,590
Hey, Eunuch Yoon.

153
00:12:38,760 --> 00:12:40,200
Go tie His Royal Highness's hat string.

154
00:13:02,020 --> 00:13:03,950
- Se Dol.
- Yes?

155
00:13:04,050 --> 00:13:07,020
Do you know what you call gold floating on water?

156
00:13:07,090 --> 00:13:08,860
Why are you asking something so out of the blue?

157
00:13:09,730 --> 00:13:11,059
- Exactly!
- What is?

158
00:13:11,060 --> 00:13:12,560
Gold floating on water. It is "out of the blue."

159
00:13:13,230 --> 00:13:16,070
Gold floating... "Out of the blue." That is so lame.

160
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,440
You laughed, right You just laughed, right?

161
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:30,880
Something went down the wrong pipe.

162
00:13:42,230 --> 00:13:44,700
It was not me. It was His Royal Highness.

163
00:13:48,970 --> 00:13:51,940
Fine, it was me. So what?

164
00:13:54,570 --> 00:13:55,940
What do you mean, "so what"?

165
00:13:58,410 --> 00:14:00,010
We are running late. We need to go.

166
00:14:16,330 --> 00:14:18,330
Why is Dal here?

167
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:24,399
From now on, Dal will be helping with the Gyesa Year Incident.

168
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:26,940
By any chance, is the reason Dal is here...

169
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:29,170
related to your feelings for her?

170
00:14:31,140 --> 00:14:33,440
Feelings? Do not be ridiculous.

171
00:14:35,110 --> 00:14:36,410
Me neither, you know.

172
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:40,120
Who said it did?

173
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:44,620
Why do you not stop prying and tell us your news from Qing?

174
00:14:53,830 --> 00:14:57,330
I believe the Jimjo Birdy owner's son is alive.

175
00:15:00,100 --> 00:15:03,070
This will be the one and only time I lie.

176
00:15:09,750 --> 00:15:12,320
Based on his age, the burn scars, and how the old man from Qing...

177
00:15:12,380 --> 00:15:15,420
suddenly moved after the fire in the Year of Imjin,

178
00:15:15,820 --> 00:15:19,260
I suspect the old man's son is the son of the Jimjo's owner.

179
00:15:24,130 --> 00:15:25,200
That makes sense.

180
00:15:25,460 --> 00:15:28,170
Then why do we not bring him here right now?

181
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:31,569
This letter says he is missing.

182
00:15:31,570 --> 00:15:33,600
It is going to take time to find him.

183
00:15:36,740 --> 00:15:38,310
If we can just find this son,

184
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:41,010
this could all be resolved quite easily.

185
00:15:42,180 --> 00:15:43,180
Perhaps...

186
00:15:43,850 --> 00:15:46,280
we could even take down the Left State Councillor before the wedding.

187
00:15:46,820 --> 00:15:49,190
Even though you clearly cannot stand me,

188
00:15:49,590 --> 00:15:51,220
I guess you plan on cancelling the Royal Wedding.

189
00:15:52,290 --> 00:15:54,990
Is she the one in the Royal Wedding?

190
00:15:55,130 --> 00:15:56,330
What?

191
00:15:58,630 --> 00:16:00,900
No, I mean... Me.

192
00:16:01,570 --> 00:16:02,770
I am talking about me.

193
00:16:03,030 --> 00:16:04,800
I am the one who plans on calling off the Royal Wedding.

194
00:16:04,870 --> 00:16:07,740
What do you mean you are not going through with the Royal Wedding?

195
00:16:12,610 --> 00:16:14,810
It is just that, no matter how I look at it...

196
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:17,249
- it just does not make...
- Gang.

197
00:16:17,250 --> 00:16:18,280
Come on.

198
00:16:18,650 --> 00:16:21,490
Are you not counting your chickens before they hatch?

199
00:16:21,820 --> 00:16:24,220
You have to find the son of the Jimjo's owner...

200
00:16:24,520 --> 00:16:27,019
and use his proof to catch the Left State Councillor.

201
00:16:27,020 --> 00:16:28,490
That is the only way.

202
00:16:29,090 --> 00:16:32,660
The Royal Wedding is in a month. Can you really do all that by then?

203
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:34,600
Why do you have to rain on our parade...

204
00:16:37,330 --> 00:16:40,600
You lied to me? Why did you hide the fact that I am here?

205
00:16:42,310 --> 00:16:45,310
- Let us go outside. We can talk...
- What is he talking about?

206
00:16:46,080 --> 00:16:47,310
What does he mean, you hid his existence?

207
00:16:48,450 --> 00:16:51,480
Gang. You understand the Qing language?

208
00:16:52,120 --> 00:16:53,150
Well...

209
00:16:53,820 --> 00:16:54,890
I picked some up here and there.

210
00:16:55,690 --> 00:16:58,050
Where is the man who raised the Jimjo?

211
00:16:58,220 --> 00:17:01,590
Soon after selling the bird, a fire killed his entire family.

212
00:17:01,760 --> 00:17:04,030
Apparently, all his Jimjo Birds were also destroyed in the blaze.

213
00:17:16,970 --> 00:17:18,710
So he is the son of the bird's owner?

214
00:17:21,110 --> 00:17:23,610
- That is...
- Let me go.

215
00:17:28,350 --> 00:17:29,720
You have some explaining to do.

216
00:17:33,220 --> 00:17:36,030
I will explain. I can explain everything.

217
00:17:50,870 --> 00:17:51,940
I am sure.

218
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:55,050
After all, what right does a man who betrayed us for a woman...

219
00:17:55,450 --> 00:17:57,880
- have to say anything?
- Dal!

220
00:17:57,910 --> 00:17:59,580
Is it true? Did you betray us for the Crown Princess Consort?

221
00:17:59,820 --> 00:18:01,890
Or is there another reason?

222
00:18:06,290 --> 00:18:07,820
You knew?

223
00:18:08,260 --> 00:18:10,629
His Royal Highness has known...

224
00:18:10,630 --> 00:18:12,460
about you and the Crown Princess Consort for a long time.

225
00:18:12,660 --> 00:18:13,960
Say something.

226
00:18:14,900 --> 00:18:16,400
Just give me any excuse.

227
00:18:23,940 --> 00:18:25,040
I have no excuse.

228
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:31,310
As of today,

229
00:18:31,850 --> 00:18:34,450
you are now off the Gyesa Year Incident case.

230
00:18:35,490 --> 00:18:38,820
Take this boy from Qing. Take him in for questioning.

231
00:18:39,020 --> 00:18:40,690
Why would you order that, Lady Park?

232
00:18:43,960 --> 00:18:45,230
Take the boy away.

233
00:18:45,930 --> 00:18:46,930
Yes, Your Highness.

234
00:19:10,590 --> 00:19:12,890
Wait a minute. I am going with you.

235
00:19:13,020 --> 00:19:15,760
If the Left State Councillor learns of the Qing boy, he will kill him.

236
00:19:15,990 --> 00:19:17,060
Send him to Unjeong Palace.

237
00:19:17,330 --> 00:19:19,860
It was my private residence, so it should be a safe place.

238
00:19:20,760 --> 00:19:23,970
Have them record the boy's statement and bring it to me.

239
00:19:24,130 --> 00:19:25,140
And one more thing...

240
00:19:33,380 --> 00:19:36,010
It is okay to cry. Why do you always hide everything?

241
00:19:37,510 --> 00:19:39,680
You think I cannot tell how upset you are?

242
00:19:41,350 --> 00:19:42,490
I do not have time to be sentimental.

243
00:19:43,090 --> 00:19:44,790
The son of the Jimjo's owner is right in front of me.

244
00:19:45,190 --> 00:19:46,190
My revenge is finally within reach.

245
00:19:47,260 --> 00:19:49,060
Letting myself get swayed by some pathetic emotion...

246
00:19:49,930 --> 00:19:50,930
That is just pathetic.

247
00:19:56,100 --> 00:19:57,100
Such a tough act.

248
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,000
You are obviously hurt.

249
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:01,270
Your eyes and the tip of your nose are bright red.

250
00:20:04,370 --> 00:20:05,410
So what if they are?

251
00:20:06,180 --> 00:20:07,910
So what if I am upset? What do you want me to do about it?

252
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:09,750
I am not asking you to do anything.

253
00:20:17,190 --> 00:20:18,460
What do you think you are doing?

254
00:20:22,060 --> 00:20:23,160
Whenever I felt like this,

255
00:20:24,190 --> 00:20:26,000
I wished someone would just hold me.

256
00:20:26,930 --> 00:20:28,260
And since this is my body,

257
00:20:29,030 --> 00:20:30,870
I thought you might be feeling the same way.

258
00:20:35,710 --> 00:20:37,370
It is okay to lean on me.

259
00:20:38,170 --> 00:20:39,440
We are already sharing a body.

260
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:42,650
It would be nice to share our hearts, do you not think?

261
00:21:04,570 --> 00:21:05,600
If you hold me this tightly,

262
00:21:11,640 --> 00:21:13,110
it feels like you are going to crush me.

263
00:21:51,510 --> 00:21:52,580
Do not forget.

264
00:21:53,680 --> 00:21:55,850
There is a line between you and me, even if it is invisible.

265
00:21:58,990 --> 00:21:59,990
Do not cross it.

266
00:22:07,860 --> 00:22:08,930
And if I do?

267
00:22:10,330 --> 00:22:11,840
What will you do then?

268
00:22:16,440 --> 00:22:17,510
You will live to regret it.

269
00:22:20,110 --> 00:22:21,310
And there will be no turning back.

270
00:22:27,750 --> 00:22:29,650
The boy from Qing will not talk.

271
00:22:30,050 --> 00:22:31,990
He seems to think we are all in on it together.

272
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:37,590
Why is nothing ever easy?

273
00:22:38,600 --> 00:22:39,600
Let me get this straight.

274
00:22:40,130 --> 00:22:43,000
You let them brand you a traitor and just kept your mouth shut?

275
00:22:46,140 --> 00:22:48,370
Why did you go and make such a mess of it all?

276
00:22:48,770 --> 00:22:50,010
You have ended up with nothing to show for it.

277
00:22:50,410 --> 00:22:52,380
You should have either protected U Hui,

278
00:22:52,680 --> 00:22:54,239
or gone all out and taken down the Left State Councillor...

279
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:55,680
to prove your loyalty!

280
00:22:56,280 --> 00:22:59,050
There cannot be two good guys.

281
00:23:01,020 --> 00:23:02,120
The good guy...

282
00:23:06,620 --> 00:23:08,590
Even if I am not the good guy,

283
00:23:10,690 --> 00:23:12,200
I do not have to be a complete jerk.

284
00:23:17,970 --> 00:23:19,600
Get my official robes ready now.

285
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:21,440
Yes.

286
00:24:01,740 --> 00:24:03,010
What are you doing?

287
00:24:03,580 --> 00:24:04,780
You have to hide it.

288
00:24:05,480 --> 00:24:06,980
Bury it deep down.

289
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:09,350
Why would you reveal your lingering feelings?

290
00:24:30,010 --> 00:24:31,310
Please send Dal out.

291
00:24:35,380 --> 00:24:36,480
Just speak.

292
00:24:38,280 --> 00:24:41,650
I have proof that the Left State Councillor still has the Jimjo.

293
00:24:42,390 --> 00:24:43,950
You do? What is it?

294
00:24:44,490 --> 00:24:46,060
Did you find out where the Jimjo is?

295
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:59,670
I was the one pressuring him, but you seem more worked up, Dal.

296
00:25:04,270 --> 00:25:08,340
All right, go on. What is this proof?

297
00:25:10,050 --> 00:25:14,120
The boy from Qing believes I lied, so he will not speak easily.

298
00:25:14,320 --> 00:25:15,620
And even if he does,

299
00:25:16,220 --> 00:25:18,120
we cannot be sure he is telling the truth.

300
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:29,570
In this book...

301
00:25:30,170 --> 00:25:33,470
is everything the boy told me about the Jimjo.

302
00:25:37,070 --> 00:25:38,070
But before I give it to you,

303
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:40,140
you must make me a promise.

304
00:25:42,280 --> 00:25:44,050
Even if you take down the Left State Councillor,

305
00:25:47,020 --> 00:25:48,520
you must spare U Hui's life.

306
00:26:04,870 --> 00:26:05,900
Leave the book.

307
00:26:06,840 --> 00:26:08,869
I will consider it and let you know.

308
00:26:08,870 --> 00:26:10,870
I will only give it to you if you promise.

309
00:26:14,040 --> 00:26:15,580
Between me, who has already lost someone precious,

310
00:26:16,150 --> 00:26:19,050
and you, trying to protect someone, who do you think is more desperate?

311
00:26:21,180 --> 00:26:22,589
I will give you my answer about the Crown Princess Consort...

312
00:26:22,590 --> 00:26:23,990
after careful consideration.

313
00:26:24,820 --> 00:26:26,890
So leave the book and go.

314
00:26:32,460 --> 00:26:33,830
Hey, Prince Je Un.

315
00:26:36,770 --> 00:26:39,040
Why did you even write that book?

316
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:41,340
What was the point if you were just going to betray us?

317
00:26:45,340 --> 00:26:46,540
I just wanted to...

318
00:26:49,010 --> 00:26:50,110
put it off.

319
00:26:51,180 --> 00:26:53,980
If I defeat the Left State Councillor, U Hui becomes a slave.

320
00:26:54,380 --> 00:26:56,750
But if I do nothing, Gang will be in danger.

321
00:26:59,790 --> 00:27:01,060
I did not know what to do.

322
00:27:03,890 --> 00:27:05,830
Then you should have just picked a side.

323
00:27:07,100 --> 00:27:08,700
Either you should have begged His Highness for forgiveness,

324
00:27:09,370 --> 00:27:11,930
or burned that book to stop this whole revenge plot.

325
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:13,000
What is this pathetic indecisiveness?

326
00:27:14,570 --> 00:27:15,570
If I begged,

327
00:27:16,040 --> 00:27:18,240
would that erase the fact that I betrayed my brother?

328
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:24,780
And if I burned the book,

329
00:27:25,280 --> 00:27:27,880
could I take back the horrible things I said to U Hui?

330
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:32,320
I am always a coward.

331
00:27:33,890 --> 00:27:35,860
And a coward cannot make a choice.

332
00:27:40,260 --> 00:27:42,100
How utterly cowardly of me.

333
00:27:42,770 --> 00:27:45,130
Even though I know I am the reason for all this danger,

334
00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:49,010
and yet, all I have done is hurt her.

335
00:27:56,010 --> 00:27:57,210
I wonder if cowardice runs in the family.

336
00:28:03,550 --> 00:28:05,420
Why do I keep acting so pathetic?

337
00:28:23,470 --> 00:28:26,140
Gosh, this writing is minuscule.

338
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:30,580
You can only write like this if you pour your heart into it.

339
00:28:31,450 --> 00:28:35,320
A betrayer would not be this careful. Absolutely not.

340
00:28:39,320 --> 00:28:40,760
Hey, now.

341
00:28:41,590 --> 00:28:42,590
The line.

342
00:28:44,990 --> 00:28:47,960
Fine. I get it. Okay.

343
00:28:48,360 --> 00:28:51,030
There. See? A line.

344
00:28:51,270 --> 00:28:53,240
I made a line. Happy now?

345
00:28:55,440 --> 00:28:58,310
- Do you not dare cross that line.
- Unbelievable.

346
00:29:01,240 --> 00:29:04,280
So, did you find any new information in there?

347
00:29:07,820 --> 00:29:10,920
The Jimjo Poison becomes harmless within three days of extraction.

348
00:29:12,290 --> 00:29:13,290
The Left State Councillor gained power over Joseon...

349
00:29:13,291 --> 00:29:14,320
with the Jimjo Bird.

350
00:29:14,860 --> 00:29:16,760
He is not the kind of man who would throw away such a prize.

351
00:29:17,230 --> 00:29:19,930
He definitely still has the Jimjo.

352
00:29:23,100 --> 00:29:24,100
Actually,

353
00:29:24,800 --> 00:29:27,240
back when I was almost enslaved over the incident in your chambers,

354
00:29:28,070 --> 00:29:30,110
His Majesty said something to me.

355
00:29:30,540 --> 00:29:32,340
Do not defy the Left State Councillor.

356
00:29:34,210 --> 00:29:36,580
The Gyesa Year Incident is not over yet.

357
00:29:37,250 --> 00:29:38,850
Come to think of it,

358
00:29:41,320 --> 00:29:42,950
does that not mean the Jimjo is still alive?

359
00:29:45,120 --> 00:29:48,120
Then our objective has become clear.

360
00:29:49,860 --> 00:29:52,760
We have to find the Jimjo and expose its owner.

361
00:29:54,160 --> 00:29:55,160
Then what?

362
00:29:56,170 --> 00:29:57,769
We will prove the Gyesa Year Incident...

363
00:29:57,770 --> 00:29:59,140
was a murder by Jimjo Poison,

364
00:29:59,640 --> 00:30:03,840
and the owner is the real culprit behind it and a traitor.

365
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:05,840
Even if he is the Left State Councillor,

366
00:30:06,740 --> 00:30:08,710
he will not be able to escape the charge of treason.

367
00:30:10,310 --> 00:30:11,310
Then,

368
00:30:12,010 --> 00:30:14,250
with the Gyesa Incident autopsies His Highness has gathered...

369
00:30:14,450 --> 00:30:17,750
and all those other documents,

370
00:30:18,420 --> 00:30:20,320
we just have to catch the Jimjo, right?

371
00:30:23,090 --> 00:30:24,890
We need more conclusive evidence.

372
00:30:29,970 --> 00:30:32,500
We must catch the Jimjo alive on the Left State Councillor's estate.

373
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:36,010
We should search his private estate then.

374
00:30:53,790 --> 00:30:55,520
I did not think you would come, Ok.

375
00:30:55,960 --> 00:30:57,860
It has been a long time, Left State Councillor.

376
00:31:01,060 --> 00:31:03,830
Can you not speak casually to me like you used to?

377
00:31:17,180 --> 00:31:18,180
I suppose...

378
00:31:18,850 --> 00:31:21,250
I will never see the old you I once knew again.

379
00:31:21,650 --> 00:31:23,820
It is I who has lost the younger brother I once cherished.

380
00:31:28,120 --> 00:31:30,590
Why did you wish to see me today?

381
00:31:32,800 --> 00:31:33,860
Dal of the Park family.

382
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:37,430
The girl from Boryeong who was a peddler.

383
00:31:37,700 --> 00:31:38,930
She is my wife's niece.

384
00:31:39,770 --> 00:31:41,400
How do you know of her, Your Excellency?

385
00:31:41,840 --> 00:31:42,840
Strange, is it not?

386
00:31:44,210 --> 00:31:47,040
As your wife's niece, you would think she is from a noble family.

387
00:31:47,610 --> 00:31:50,280
And yet, she was a peddler, then an eunuch,

388
00:31:50,580 --> 00:31:52,580
and now a court lady.

389
00:31:53,520 --> 00:31:55,720
A court lady in the Crown Prince's chambers, no less.

390
00:31:57,190 --> 00:31:58,520
In times like these,

391
00:31:59,060 --> 00:32:01,090
what could be more frightening than wagging tongues?

392
00:32:02,260 --> 00:32:05,900
I heard she lost her parents and took odd jobs to make ends meet.

393
00:32:06,730 --> 00:32:08,860
You are not that close, I take it?

394
00:32:11,170 --> 00:32:12,200
That used to be the case.

395
00:32:12,970 --> 00:32:15,470
But I do not know if you are aware, Your Excellency,

396
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:19,180
but that girl, Dal, saved my daughter's life.

397
00:32:19,540 --> 00:32:22,680
I have come to treat her like my own daughter,

398
00:32:23,250 --> 00:32:26,380
and I have promised to protect her with my life.

399
00:32:26,680 --> 00:32:29,290
And here I thought she was so fearless and impertinent.

400
00:32:31,220 --> 00:32:33,160
Turns out she had someone in her corner.

401
00:32:36,460 --> 00:32:37,460
If I...

402
00:32:38,530 --> 00:32:40,330
were to harm that girl...

403
00:32:41,330 --> 00:32:42,330
Then I...

404
00:32:43,570 --> 00:32:45,230
will not stand idly by.

405
00:32:52,310 --> 00:32:53,310
No wonder.

406
00:32:54,510 --> 00:32:57,910
I was wondering why you agreed to meet me so easily.

407
00:32:59,280 --> 00:33:01,350
You came here today to warn me, did you not?

408
00:33:03,490 --> 00:33:04,490
In that case,

409
00:33:06,860 --> 00:33:08,160
since I have said my piece,

410
00:33:09,290 --> 00:33:10,490
I will take my leave now.

411
00:33:18,830 --> 00:33:19,870
Listen, Han Chul.

412
00:33:21,470 --> 00:33:22,610
Are you satisfied now?

413
00:33:23,670 --> 00:33:26,510
Be satisfied with what you have, and stop here.

414
00:33:28,610 --> 00:33:29,610
If you go any further,

415
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:32,380
even the deepest revenge becomes meaningless.

416
00:34:20,060 --> 00:34:21,200
What revenge...

417
00:34:22,930 --> 00:34:24,230
ever brings satisfaction?

418
00:34:26,770 --> 00:34:28,900
(Dal's Quarters)

419
00:35:00,740 --> 00:35:01,800
Look, it is not like...

420
00:35:03,710 --> 00:35:07,080
- I am not taking his side, but...
- Gosh.

421
00:35:07,640 --> 00:35:08,980
Sounds like you are already not on my side.

422
00:35:10,580 --> 00:35:13,320
If I am being honest,

423
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:16,290
you are not even guaranteeing the Crown Princess Consort's safety,

424
00:35:16,790 --> 00:35:19,220
but you just keep taking all the information.

425
00:35:19,490 --> 00:35:21,360
That is kind of a betrayal, is it not?

426
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:30,830
I have stopped at nothing to get this far.

427
00:35:32,270 --> 00:35:34,140
You think a guilty conscience will hold me back?

428
00:35:35,140 --> 00:35:36,470
I do not care if they call me a coward.

429
00:35:38,410 --> 00:35:39,710
And I do not care if they call me dirty.

430
00:35:50,890 --> 00:35:53,120
So what if you are a coward?

431
00:35:53,890 --> 00:35:55,860
Who cares if you have to play a little dirty?

432
00:35:58,230 --> 00:36:00,030
The bad guys do terrible things like it is nothing,

433
00:36:00,360 --> 00:36:02,400
and all fate ever does is dump on us,

434
00:36:02,730 --> 00:36:04,030
so how can anyone not stoop to their level?

435
00:36:04,470 --> 00:36:06,040
How can you not feel beaten down?

436
00:36:09,070 --> 00:36:10,210
So, it is okay.

437
00:36:10,610 --> 00:36:12,340
Even if you have to be a coward or stoop low,

438
00:36:12,680 --> 00:36:14,040
just lie low for a little while.

439
00:36:14,380 --> 00:36:16,650
Even if the whole world turns on you,

440
00:36:17,110 --> 00:36:18,250
the one taking all the heat right now...

441
00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:20,920
is me.

442
00:36:33,330 --> 00:36:35,600
There she goes again, mercilessly breaking down my walls.

443
00:36:37,500 --> 00:36:40,070
What? What was that?

444
00:36:40,370 --> 00:36:41,370
The line.

445
00:36:43,270 --> 00:36:45,510
Gosh. Sure.

446
00:36:46,110 --> 00:36:50,110
What is next? You want me to just wait outside?

447
00:36:50,350 --> 00:36:51,410
Get away.

448
00:36:52,980 --> 00:36:54,050
As far as you can.

449
00:37:05,460 --> 00:37:07,030
Come on, Mangdeok. Time for dinner.

450
00:37:08,660 --> 00:37:12,370
Are you not the cutest?

451
00:37:14,600 --> 00:37:17,940
Gosh. A dog's life is the best life.

452
00:37:18,010 --> 00:37:21,040
You eat meat that most commoners can only dream of. Right?

453
00:37:21,110 --> 00:37:23,310
You seem to have a lot of complaints about the country.

454
00:37:23,450 --> 00:37:27,150
No, I am just jealous, that is all.

455
00:37:27,350 --> 00:37:31,250
He just hangs out in this big palace and have someone feed him.

456
00:37:31,750 --> 00:37:33,790
Is that not a better life than what most people have?

457
00:37:35,420 --> 00:37:36,590
Gosh.

458
00:37:36,660 --> 00:37:40,130
If only someone would bring me my meals regularly...

459
00:37:47,540 --> 00:37:48,540
"A dog's life"?

460
00:37:48,970 --> 00:37:50,769
Are you saying I have a dog's life?

461
00:37:50,770 --> 00:37:51,840
No.

462
00:37:53,510 --> 00:37:55,940
Not you. I was talking about the Jimjo. The Jimjo Bird.

463
00:37:56,280 --> 00:37:57,509
The Left State Councillor owns it, right?

464
00:37:57,510 --> 00:38:00,250
He would not just let it roam free.

465
00:38:00,680 --> 00:38:02,950
So if it is caged up, how does it get fed?

466
00:38:03,050 --> 00:38:05,950
Nice try changing the subject. Why ask something so obvious?

467
00:38:10,630 --> 00:38:11,630
(The Left State Councillor's man bought a Jimjo...)

468
00:38:11,690 --> 00:38:12,700
(and started a fire at the owner's house.)

469
00:38:12,760 --> 00:38:13,800
(He was wearing a mask.)

470
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:18,700
The Jimjo's keeper?

471
00:38:23,770 --> 00:38:24,770
(Cheonghye Merchant Guild)

472
00:38:25,970 --> 00:38:28,510
These from the Cheonghye Guild are precious and restorative,

473
00:38:29,480 --> 00:38:30,650
so I will store them separately myself.

474
00:38:38,750 --> 00:38:42,290
(Honey supplied by Cheonghye Merchant Guild)

475
00:39:00,340 --> 00:39:01,380
Your Royal Highness.

476
00:39:02,240 --> 00:39:05,350
It is a great honour to have you grace my humble home.

477
00:39:06,150 --> 00:39:07,680
Where does one obtain poisonous insects?

478
00:39:08,220 --> 00:39:10,720
Common folks cannot catch them. Only specialised hunters can.

479
00:39:13,890 --> 00:39:15,560
Then we must first meet the hunters in the capital city.

480
00:39:15,720 --> 00:39:17,989
What? Are you just going to walk up and ask them,

481
00:39:17,990 --> 00:39:19,530
"Hey, do you feed the Jimjo?"

482
00:39:19,760 --> 00:39:21,000
Or ask if they know the man in the mask?

483
00:39:21,300 --> 00:39:22,300
Then...

484
00:39:23,030 --> 00:39:24,030
what do we do?

485
00:39:25,070 --> 00:39:26,070
I just so happen...

486
00:39:27,340 --> 00:39:30,170
to have an expert catcher, a swallow, up my sleeve.

487
00:39:31,210 --> 00:39:32,840
Right. Yes.

488
00:39:33,380 --> 00:39:34,810
But how do you know who I am?

489
00:39:35,040 --> 00:39:36,279
He looks familiar.

490
00:39:36,280 --> 00:39:38,580
You saw him at the Royal Office of Attire, Your Highness.

491
00:39:38,850 --> 00:39:39,850
He can identify Jimjo Poison.

492
00:39:41,120 --> 00:39:43,750
Where on earth would you find a poison like that?

493
00:39:44,050 --> 00:39:45,720
Unless you are talking about Jimjo Poison.

494
00:39:47,360 --> 00:39:50,660
Right. The acupuncture physician? I remember now.

495
00:39:51,560 --> 00:39:55,460
Lady, you claimed to have found him. How can you only remember now?

496
00:39:57,630 --> 00:39:59,030
Right, so...

497
00:39:59,230 --> 00:40:03,070
His Royal Highness just remembered, not me.

498
00:40:03,240 --> 00:40:05,340
Oh, it is all coming back to me now.

499
00:40:08,910 --> 00:40:11,010
But I thought we came to see the snake catchers.

500
00:40:11,180 --> 00:40:14,950
Physicians and snake catchers have always been close.

501
00:40:15,150 --> 00:40:17,350
Now, this gentleman... No,

502
00:40:17,720 --> 00:40:22,120
This person will be a big help. You will get valuable information.

503
00:40:29,360 --> 00:40:31,230
- What?
- Lady.

504
00:40:31,830 --> 00:40:32,840
Come on, let us do this!

505
00:40:34,570 --> 00:40:35,570
Why me?

506
00:40:37,710 --> 00:40:38,910
No way!

507
00:40:41,640 --> 00:40:45,410
If we are seen with snake catchers, the Left State Councillor will know.

508
00:40:45,610 --> 00:40:48,680
You are under less scrutiny, so you are perfect for the job.

509
00:40:52,190 --> 00:40:54,320
Come on, wait for me!

510
00:40:55,560 --> 00:40:57,589
- Do you know him?
- Do you?

511
00:40:57,590 --> 00:40:59,230
I do not know. I have no idea!

512
00:40:59,360 --> 00:41:00,530
We do not know him.

513
00:41:03,670 --> 00:41:04,670
Again?

514
00:41:06,570 --> 00:41:07,570
Go on.

515
00:41:16,750 --> 00:41:18,280
Look here. Do you know what this is?

516
00:41:19,850 --> 00:41:21,120
This is another dead end...

517
00:41:21,180 --> 00:41:23,050
Take a closer look. A really good look.

518
00:41:23,520 --> 00:41:24,820
Here. You do not recognise him?

519
00:41:25,720 --> 00:41:27,290
I do not know. I really do not.

520
00:41:56,290 --> 00:41:57,920
Fine, just go.

521
00:41:58,320 --> 00:41:59,660
Go on, fly away.

522
00:42:01,190 --> 00:42:02,790
Nobody recognises him anyway.

523
00:42:04,690 --> 00:42:05,690
Go away!

524
00:42:06,700 --> 00:42:07,700
Go!

525
00:42:57,980 --> 00:42:59,610
Please give me one more chance.

526
00:43:01,750 --> 00:43:03,450
I found it in Park Dal's quarters.

527
00:43:04,290 --> 00:43:06,090
I thought it might be a love letter...

528
00:43:14,400 --> 00:43:16,130
So, it is a love letter to Grand Prince Un.

529
00:43:18,830 --> 00:43:21,100
But there is no mention of Grand Prince Un.

530
00:43:21,340 --> 00:43:22,940
The apple does not fall far from the tree.

531
00:43:23,470 --> 00:43:26,010
Both you and your niece.

532
00:43:26,410 --> 00:43:28,380
Court ladies in love.

533
00:43:31,150 --> 00:43:32,150
I will do it.

534
00:43:33,250 --> 00:43:34,650
I will do anything.

535
00:43:36,250 --> 00:43:38,150
Please just spare Mi Geum.

536
00:43:39,720 --> 00:43:41,820
I will make sure that girl take the infertility drug this time.

537
00:43:42,090 --> 00:43:43,130
Get rid of her.

538
00:43:45,260 --> 00:43:46,730
You said you just had something to confirm...

539
00:43:47,630 --> 00:43:49,500
and that I only had to give her the infertility drug.

540
00:43:49,700 --> 00:43:52,330
A past memory made me soft for a moment,

541
00:43:53,870 --> 00:43:55,500
but if you let the past hold you back,

542
00:43:56,410 --> 00:43:58,240
you can never move forward.

543
00:43:59,310 --> 00:44:02,110
That face that looks too much like the Deposed Crown Princess.

544
00:44:04,750 --> 00:44:05,750
It unnerves me.

545
00:44:09,120 --> 00:44:12,050
How can two families be wiped out on the same day?

546
00:44:12,250 --> 00:44:16,220
Their old mother who cannot speak. How will she survive on her own?

547
00:44:16,290 --> 00:44:17,360
Tell me about it.

548
00:44:26,470 --> 00:44:29,270
Judging by the lack of reaction from the silver needle,

549
00:44:29,700 --> 00:44:30,970
I do not believe it is poison.

550
00:44:31,170 --> 00:44:34,040
If it was not poison, then how could two families die at the same time?

551
00:44:34,310 --> 00:44:38,780
With poison, the body is usually bloated or black from decay...

552
00:44:38,810 --> 00:44:39,850
No reaction to silver.

553
00:44:40,680 --> 00:44:42,480
And the body is not turning black or decaying.

554
00:44:42,780 --> 00:44:43,790
It is Jimjo Poison.

555
00:44:44,550 --> 00:44:45,720
In this case, the investigation should...

556
00:44:45,950 --> 00:44:48,159
No break-in or poison was found.

557
00:44:48,160 --> 00:44:49,960
Should we not rule it as death by unknown causes?

558
00:44:50,460 --> 00:44:51,460
Death by unknown causes?

559
00:44:51,530 --> 00:44:53,100
I need to write the report. Move the bodies to the Bureau.

560
00:44:53,160 --> 00:44:54,160
Darn it.

561
00:44:54,430 --> 00:44:55,430
Yes, sir.

562
00:45:10,180 --> 00:45:11,180
Excuse me.

563
00:45:14,650 --> 00:45:15,650
By any chance,

564
00:45:16,850 --> 00:45:18,120
have you seen this man?

565
00:45:25,990 --> 00:45:27,700
I am not here to harm you.

566
00:45:28,400 --> 00:45:29,530
I am here to help you.

567
00:45:33,570 --> 00:45:34,570
This man...

568
00:45:36,440 --> 00:45:38,010
is the one who killed your family, is he not?

569
00:45:43,210 --> 00:45:45,750
I am looking for him too. His leader...

570
00:45:47,950 --> 00:45:49,380
killed my family too.

571
00:45:51,020 --> 00:45:52,220
So, please, will you tell me...

572
00:45:52,820 --> 00:45:54,520
everything you know about him,

573
00:45:55,960 --> 00:45:58,460
so I can catch him and get my revenge...

574
00:46:00,200 --> 00:46:01,730
and get justice for you?

575
00:46:32,090 --> 00:46:33,160
This scent pouch...

576
00:46:34,500 --> 00:46:35,560
is his?

577
00:46:53,980 --> 00:46:56,520
What was that? His Majesty is looking for me?

578
00:46:58,820 --> 00:47:00,420
There is no getting out of it today.

579
00:47:07,530 --> 00:47:10,500
- What did the desk ever do to you?
- What was that?

580
00:47:10,900 --> 00:47:11,900
Pardon?

581
00:47:12,900 --> 00:47:15,270
It is nothing.

582
00:47:15,970 --> 00:47:19,010
So, why did you summon me?

583
00:47:19,910 --> 00:47:22,980
The Chief Court Lady kidnapped Park Dal,

584
00:47:23,310 --> 00:47:25,450
and you still have not learned your lesson?

585
00:47:26,620 --> 00:47:27,620
I am sorry?

586
00:47:28,780 --> 00:47:33,190
- Kidnapped?
- That girl was prepared to die...

587
00:47:33,420 --> 00:47:37,660
fighting the infertility drug. Have you no shame, Crown Prince?

588
00:47:39,390 --> 00:47:42,700
But over here, it seems there is drug on it.

589
00:47:43,230 --> 00:47:44,230
No, wait.

590
00:47:44,870 --> 00:47:45,870
Then that time...

591
00:47:47,740 --> 00:47:50,670
Do not tell me you did not know.

592
00:47:51,640 --> 00:47:52,640
No.

593
00:47:53,880 --> 00:47:54,980
I had no idea.

594
00:47:58,750 --> 00:47:59,750
I...

595
00:48:01,980 --> 00:48:03,420
I knew absolutely nothing.

596
00:48:16,970 --> 00:48:19,600
- Spare some change for an offering.
- Not interested.

597
00:48:19,670 --> 00:48:23,440
You seem to have bad karma. If no offering, how about a beating?

598
00:48:23,970 --> 00:48:24,970
What are you talking about?

599
00:48:27,880 --> 00:48:28,880
What?

600
00:48:29,910 --> 00:48:31,910
Hey! What are you two doing here?

601
00:48:32,510 --> 00:48:34,720
You little brat! What are you doing here?

602
00:48:35,620 --> 00:48:37,890
- Stay still, will you?
- What's this?

603
00:48:38,850 --> 00:48:42,020
- Why is this coming off?
- Duck your head. This is flimsy.

604
00:48:42,090 --> 00:48:44,790
Let us talk somewhere private. All three of us are fugitives here.

605
00:48:44,860 --> 00:48:45,860
Right. This way.

606
00:48:45,930 --> 00:48:48,960
Wait. Hey, hold on. Where are you taking me?

607
00:48:49,230 --> 00:48:52,300
- What is going on?
- Dal! You are not hurt, are you?

608
00:48:52,570 --> 00:48:53,570
Are you hurt anywhere?

609
00:48:53,940 --> 00:48:56,910
Physically, I am fine, but...

610
00:48:57,440 --> 00:48:58,440
Give it back.

611
00:49:00,040 --> 00:49:04,180
You did not happen to meet anyone or remember anything, did you?

612
00:49:04,610 --> 00:49:07,180
I met a bunch of people,

613
00:49:07,680 --> 00:49:09,780
but nothing in particular comes to mind.

614
00:49:10,690 --> 00:49:11,690
Why?

615
00:49:13,150 --> 00:49:14,160
Good enough.

616
00:49:17,160 --> 00:49:18,160
Tie her up.

617
00:49:18,530 --> 00:49:19,930
- Right.
- Tie me up? What for?

618
00:49:20,700 --> 00:49:23,630
Why? Why are you tying me up? What is this? Let go!

619
00:49:23,770 --> 00:49:25,230
Untie me this instant!

620
00:49:26,030 --> 00:49:27,500
I have to go to the Palace!

621
00:49:27,540 --> 00:49:30,270
You are not going to the palace but to the skies.

622
00:49:30,570 --> 00:49:33,210
The skies? That is ridiculous! What are you talking about?

623
00:49:34,140 --> 00:49:35,780
I am asking you nicely. Now, untie me!

624
00:49:35,910 --> 00:49:38,750
- Dal, want to take a little nap?
- Sleep? Are you kidding me?

625
00:49:39,250 --> 00:49:42,120
How much of this should I give her?

626
00:49:46,920 --> 00:49:50,960
Should I give her the whole thing?

627
00:49:51,590 --> 00:49:54,930
- No. A corpse cannot get on a boat.
- I see.

628
00:49:55,630 --> 00:49:57,130
A corpse?

629
00:49:59,530 --> 00:50:01,700
Send word to the palace!

630
00:50:02,440 --> 00:50:03,970
Summon His Royal Highness, the Crown Prince!

631
00:50:05,840 --> 00:50:07,580
Dal, how do you know His Royal Highness?

632
00:50:08,680 --> 00:50:13,420
- You really met His Royal Highness?
- I did. I mean, yes.

633
00:50:14,680 --> 00:50:16,280
His Royal Highness the Crown Prince is my backer,

634
00:50:16,750 --> 00:50:18,320
so there is no need for me to escape to the skies.

635
00:50:21,560 --> 00:50:22,560
The scar.

636
00:50:24,590 --> 00:50:26,030
When did it disappear?

637
00:50:27,600 --> 00:50:28,600
What was that?

638
00:50:35,370 --> 00:50:39,040
- Hey, do not touch it.
- I did not. Gosh.

639
00:50:39,710 --> 00:50:41,280
- What?
- What?

640
00:50:41,910 --> 00:50:45,480
And who might this be? I missed you all so much.

641
00:50:46,380 --> 00:50:47,620
- Your Royal Highness!
- Your Royal Highness!

642
00:50:47,880 --> 00:50:50,790
My goodness, what are you doing?

643
00:50:51,090 --> 00:50:52,950
Get up. Come on.

644
00:50:53,520 --> 00:50:56,790
It is me. Mom, Dad, it is your daughter, Dal.

645
00:50:56,960 --> 00:50:59,960
What? No, you are not Dal,

646
00:51:00,300 --> 00:51:02,600
and you are not our daughter.

647
00:51:02,960 --> 00:51:04,900
- He is a man.
- Right.

648
00:51:06,400 --> 00:51:07,970
So here is what happened.

649
00:51:14,580 --> 00:51:15,680
You!

650
00:51:16,740 --> 00:51:17,750
Wait a minute.

651
00:51:19,350 --> 00:51:20,350
You?

652
00:51:20,920 --> 00:51:21,920
So, let me get this straight.

653
00:51:22,820 --> 00:51:26,220
The Crown Prince grabbed the scar on Dal's wrist,

654
00:51:26,290 --> 00:51:28,520
there was a flash of light, you fell into the water,

655
00:51:28,890 --> 00:51:29,890
and you two swapped bodies?

656
00:51:30,330 --> 00:51:32,160
What is this, some kind of folktale?

657
00:51:32,490 --> 00:51:34,830
What is next? You will say you hatched from an egg?

658
00:51:35,160 --> 00:51:36,900
Of course.

659
00:51:37,230 --> 00:51:39,629
I am surprised a dragon did not appear,

660
00:51:39,630 --> 00:51:40,870
and I did not sprout wings.

661
00:51:40,970 --> 00:51:41,970
Goodness.

662
00:51:42,700 --> 00:51:44,410
That smart mouth definitely belongs to our daughter.

663
00:51:44,640 --> 00:51:47,440
No, a person can pick up someone else's way of talking.

664
00:51:47,540 --> 00:51:49,080
Pick it up? What is it, the plague?

665
00:51:51,650 --> 00:51:52,650
But now that I look closely,

666
00:51:53,350 --> 00:51:55,850
that subtle glimmer in his eyes...

667
00:51:56,320 --> 00:51:58,650
is our daughter's eyes.

668
00:52:00,120 --> 00:52:04,460
Have you lost your mind? Your Royal Highness, please kill me!

669
00:52:04,860 --> 00:52:06,060
We are deeply sorry, Your Royal Highness.

670
00:52:07,500 --> 00:52:09,660
That is the mark of a sealed red thread of fate.

671
00:52:10,100 --> 00:52:11,900
If the read thread of fate, which was forcibly severed,

672
00:52:12,370 --> 00:52:15,540
should stir upon finding its true partner again,

673
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:18,270
then even I will be powerless to stop it.

674
00:52:20,280 --> 00:52:22,080
I have committed a grave offence.

675
00:52:26,780 --> 00:52:27,880
Everyone, leave us.

676
00:52:28,820 --> 00:52:31,890
Your Royal Highness, please stay and speak with me.

677
00:52:37,990 --> 00:52:38,990
Close it.

678
00:52:40,090 --> 00:52:43,060
- Your Highness!
- Your Highness! No, we just...

679
00:52:45,100 --> 00:52:46,940
Come now, this way.

680
00:52:47,740 --> 00:52:48,740
Your Royal Highness.

681
00:52:51,910 --> 00:52:52,940
Now, speak.

682
00:52:53,240 --> 00:52:55,240
There is more to Dal's scar, is there not?

683
00:52:55,710 --> 00:52:56,710
A long time ago,

684
00:52:57,980 --> 00:52:59,910
Dal once fell into the water.

685
00:53:00,720 --> 00:53:03,320
A red scar suddenly appeared on her wrist then.

686
00:53:04,050 --> 00:53:05,390
After that, she lost her memory,

687
00:53:06,350 --> 00:53:08,290
and I have thought it peculiar ever since.

688
00:53:09,290 --> 00:53:10,290
The water?

689
00:53:10,960 --> 00:53:12,690
There is definitely something about the water, then.

690
00:53:14,230 --> 00:53:15,230
What else?

691
00:53:15,760 --> 00:53:19,230
Was there anything else unusual? Tell me everything you know.

692
00:53:19,730 --> 00:53:21,770
You want us to switch back, do you not?

693
00:53:26,070 --> 00:53:27,110
All I know...

694
00:53:28,010 --> 00:53:29,180
is everything I have told you.

695
00:53:44,190 --> 00:53:46,890
My mom and dad may have run away,

696
00:53:47,760 --> 00:53:49,700
but they are by no means bad people.

697
00:53:50,200 --> 00:53:51,530
You know that old saying, right?

698
00:53:51,870 --> 00:53:53,800
"Falling in love is not a crime."

699
00:53:54,500 --> 00:53:57,040
There is that load of nonsense, anyway.

700
00:53:59,440 --> 00:54:01,110
Some love can be a crime.

701
00:54:01,540 --> 00:54:02,940
It is a sin, but still...

702
00:54:03,510 --> 00:54:05,110
I saved your life, and...

703
00:54:05,350 --> 00:54:06,979
The fact that our bodies even switched...

704
00:54:06,980 --> 00:54:08,550
This cannot be some ordinary fate.

705
00:54:10,120 --> 00:54:11,790
So for my sake, could you...

706
00:54:11,990 --> 00:54:14,160
Are you worried I will harm your family?

707
00:54:15,060 --> 00:54:19,630
- You locked them in Unjeong Palace.
- Locked them?

708
00:54:20,760 --> 00:54:21,760
I am protecting them.

709
00:54:23,030 --> 00:54:25,030
The Left State Councillor knows about your family's inn,

710
00:54:25,500 --> 00:54:28,400
I worried he might take them hostage to threaten you.

711
00:54:29,670 --> 00:54:33,270
I had no idea. Gosh, I was worried for nothing.

712
00:54:34,640 --> 00:54:37,480
But why the long face?

713
00:54:39,010 --> 00:54:40,680
The snake hunters and their families...

714
00:54:41,150 --> 00:54:42,420
were killed with the Jimjo Poison.

715
00:54:43,180 --> 00:54:44,450
It is so cruel.

716
00:54:44,990 --> 00:54:46,420
How are those left behind supposed to go on?

717
00:54:50,060 --> 00:54:51,060
It is all my fault.

718
00:54:51,860 --> 00:54:55,330
If I had not gone poking around, they would still be alive.

719
00:54:55,660 --> 00:54:57,300
How is that your fault, Your Royal Highness?

720
00:54:57,970 --> 00:54:59,400
Someone else did the killing.

721
00:55:00,970 --> 00:55:04,010
I hate how I always let things slip through my fingers.

722
00:55:06,770 --> 00:55:08,310
Even those I am sworn to protect,

723
00:55:09,710 --> 00:55:12,710
I could not protect a single one of them.

724
00:55:14,950 --> 00:55:16,280
You protected me.

725
00:55:28,130 --> 00:55:29,459
The Chief Court Lady almost forced me...

726
00:55:29,460 --> 00:55:30,670
to drink that infertility potion,

727
00:55:31,200 --> 00:55:32,570
but you protected me, Your Royal Highness.

728
00:55:33,570 --> 00:55:35,139
I could have been dragged and killed,

729
00:55:35,140 --> 00:55:36,570
but you fought to the very end...

730
00:55:37,640 --> 00:55:39,070
and protected me.

731
00:55:41,210 --> 00:55:42,610
How did you find out about that?

732
00:55:44,280 --> 00:55:45,480
I had hoped you would never find out.

733
00:55:46,750 --> 00:55:48,750
The Queen Dowager told me everything.

734
00:55:49,750 --> 00:55:54,420
You should have let me drink it. Why did you fight them over it?

735
00:55:54,690 --> 00:55:57,060
What if something happened to you? How could I possibly go on?

736
00:55:59,090 --> 00:56:00,560
What do you think that was? Some sweet drink?

737
00:56:01,500 --> 00:56:03,530
If you drank that, what about your dreams?

738
00:56:04,270 --> 00:56:05,530
Wearing flower shoes and settling down...

739
00:56:05,830 --> 00:56:06,870
with your own family...

740
00:56:07,440 --> 00:56:08,570
What would happen to all of that?

741
00:56:12,310 --> 00:56:13,310
You fought...

742
00:56:15,740 --> 00:56:19,080
- just for that?
- How can that be just anything?

743
00:56:20,110 --> 00:56:21,120
They are your dreams.

744
00:56:24,620 --> 00:56:26,120
Why are you doing this to me?

745
00:56:28,190 --> 00:56:29,390
I was just going to live my life...

746
00:56:30,490 --> 00:56:33,190
with my hair turning white, and my memories fading to black,

747
00:56:33,760 --> 00:56:35,630
living like a cold winter's night.

748
00:56:38,730 --> 00:56:41,270
You just had to shower me with flower petals.

749
00:56:44,970 --> 00:56:46,510
Why did you shower me with flower petals?

750
00:56:48,180 --> 00:56:49,880
Because you keep doing this, Your Highness...

751
00:56:50,110 --> 00:56:51,380
Because you keep doing this...

752
00:56:55,280 --> 00:56:58,050
You make my heart weak.

753
00:56:59,250 --> 00:57:03,320
The feelings I tried hard to swallow now feel so painful and unfair.

754
00:57:03,560 --> 00:57:04,890
And so I want to be comforted.

755
00:57:05,990 --> 00:57:07,830
And I want it to be you, Your Royal Highness.

756
00:57:12,770 --> 00:57:15,040
You are making me hope for the impossible!

757
00:57:18,010 --> 00:57:19,040
Hope for what?

758
00:57:21,140 --> 00:57:22,640
Do you like me, Your Royal Highness?

759
00:57:54,580 --> 00:57:55,610
Your Royal Highness.

760
00:58:04,920 --> 00:58:07,990
Forgive my impertinence, but I am here to arrest Park Dal.

761
00:58:10,560 --> 00:58:11,560
Wait a minute.

762
00:58:13,230 --> 00:58:16,200
Wait, on what charge are you arresting her?

763
00:58:17,730 --> 00:58:18,970
Regardless of the grounds,

764
00:58:19,230 --> 00:58:22,170
you dare arrest a court lady before the Crown Prince?

765
00:58:22,840 --> 00:58:24,970
Is that how you show contempt for your superior?

766
00:58:25,310 --> 00:58:28,610
How could I dare commit such an act of disloyalty?

767
00:58:29,110 --> 00:58:32,010
I am merely carrying out His Majesty's order.

768
00:58:32,750 --> 00:58:33,780
An order from His Majesty?

769
00:58:36,420 --> 00:58:38,049
Grand Prince Je Un had an affair...

770
00:58:38,050 --> 00:58:39,420
with the court lady from the Crown Prince's chambers?

771
00:58:39,790 --> 00:58:43,060
We found evidence in her quarters, Your Majesty.

772
00:58:43,520 --> 00:58:47,430
- What evidence?
- Does the evidence matter?

773
00:58:48,100 --> 00:58:50,870
What matters is not what the evidence is,

774
00:58:51,170 --> 00:58:53,700
but how we are to punish them.

775
00:58:55,740 --> 00:58:57,770
You have already made up your mind, have you not?

776
00:58:58,470 --> 00:59:04,180
My only wish is for the safety of Your Majesty and the Crown Prince

777
00:59:05,810 --> 00:59:06,980
An illicit affair?

778
00:59:07,750 --> 00:59:10,220
What is this absurd frame-up?

779
00:59:11,020 --> 00:59:12,649
Is it not true you stayed at the Grand Prince Je Un's home...

780
00:59:12,650 --> 00:59:14,090
before entering the palace?

781
00:59:14,320 --> 00:59:18,760
A witness also saw you at his home late at night recently.

782
00:59:18,890 --> 00:59:19,989
That was because I was running an errand...

783
00:59:19,990 --> 00:59:21,100
- for the Crown Prince.
- You wench!

784
00:59:21,500 --> 00:59:23,600
How dare you bring the Crown Prince into this?

785
00:59:26,130 --> 00:59:27,230
Then I suppose this...

786
00:59:28,440 --> 00:59:30,770
was also written by His Royal Highness?

787
00:59:35,010 --> 00:59:38,180
You recognise it. Your love letter to Grand Prince Je Un.

788
00:59:39,510 --> 00:59:40,680
Grand Prince Je Un...

789
00:59:42,120 --> 00:59:43,380
Are you kidding me?

790
00:59:44,490 --> 00:59:47,190
Does this look like a love letter to Grand Prince Je Un?

791
00:59:49,390 --> 00:59:53,560
- You think this only affects me?
- Do not worry.

792
00:59:54,400 --> 00:59:56,360
The Grand Prince is under interrogation as we speak.

793
01:00:03,970 --> 01:00:05,110
Goodness.

794
01:00:05,770 --> 01:00:08,610
Left State Councillor, do you have a crush on me?

795
01:00:09,280 --> 01:00:10,850
Why are you so obsessed with me?

796
01:00:11,810 --> 01:00:15,880
Indeed. I cannot look away from you. Grand Prince Je Un.

797
01:00:19,190 --> 01:00:23,890
People become so predictable the moment they get power.

798
01:00:24,630 --> 01:00:27,930
Toward the Royal Mother and toward me as well.

799
01:00:39,370 --> 01:00:40,370
Come on.

800
01:00:41,040 --> 01:00:42,740
There is a limit to how far you can push this.

801
01:00:43,210 --> 01:00:44,810
You call this a love letter?

802
01:00:45,280 --> 01:00:48,080
And on top of that, you claim it is for the Grand Prince?

803
01:00:48,480 --> 01:00:50,250
This is completely absurd.

804
01:00:50,790 --> 01:00:53,819
In the letter, they name themselves.

805
01:00:53,820 --> 01:00:55,760
Grand Prince Je Un and Dal of the Park family.

806
01:00:56,560 --> 01:00:57,960
What? What are they?

807
01:00:58,790 --> 01:01:02,500
"The night is dark, the moon bright. Why is my heart as hazy as a cloud?"

808
01:01:02,560 --> 01:01:04,370
You are telling me this one line is proof of an affair?

809
01:01:05,630 --> 01:01:07,870
So if you cannot find any real dirt on them,

810
01:01:07,940 --> 01:01:09,400
you will just invent some to tear them down?

811
01:01:11,270 --> 01:01:12,640
A report was filed,

812
01:01:13,210 --> 01:01:16,010
and a love letter was discovered in Park Dal's quarters.

813
01:01:16,740 --> 01:01:18,180
This is a matter concerning the court ladies,

814
01:01:19,050 --> 01:01:23,220
so it is only right to handle it according to their code of conduct.

815
01:01:25,620 --> 01:01:27,920
Fine. Leave the letter and go.

816
01:01:30,060 --> 01:01:32,360
- But, Your Highness...
- Why the hesitation?

817
01:01:33,330 --> 01:01:35,600
Are you afraid I might dispose of the letter?

818
01:01:43,440 --> 01:01:46,110
I will just say that I wrote the letter.

819
01:01:46,510 --> 01:01:47,840
It is in your handwriting, after all.

820
01:01:48,140 --> 01:01:49,940
If you claim you wrote that letter,

821
01:01:50,110 --> 01:01:53,410
the Queen Dowager's faction will use it to make you a concubine.

822
01:01:53,580 --> 01:01:54,880
And if you were to refuse,

823
01:01:55,420 --> 01:01:56,420
she would charge you with the crime...

824
01:01:56,421 --> 01:01:57,819
of refusing the Crown Prince's favour...

825
01:01:57,820 --> 01:02:00,150
and threaten to have you beheaded.

826
01:02:01,520 --> 01:02:04,390
Seriously? Beheaded over a scrap of paper?

827
01:02:06,030 --> 01:02:07,390
That is the way of the palace.

828
01:02:09,560 --> 01:02:11,330
A place where life and death hang on a single piece of paper.

829
01:02:13,230 --> 01:02:14,370
A ruthless place.

830
01:02:18,070 --> 01:02:19,170
So,

831
01:02:20,370 --> 01:02:21,640
do not do anything.

832
01:02:22,010 --> 01:02:24,810
Neither I nor Grand Prince Je Un will ever admit to it.

833
01:02:25,710 --> 01:02:29,580
If we both deny it to the very end, what can they possibly do?

834
01:02:30,420 --> 01:02:34,820
They tried to take and sterilize me. You expect me to let that go?

835
01:02:34,990 --> 01:02:37,460
I have to do something.

836
01:02:37,530 --> 01:02:40,960
If I am forced to marry and take a concubine I do not love,

837
01:02:41,430 --> 01:02:42,430
what about how I feel?

838
01:02:59,610 --> 01:03:01,920
I will be on my way.

839
01:03:03,150 --> 01:03:04,750
Please promise me something.

840
01:03:05,850 --> 01:03:09,090
Your Royal Highness, you cannot protect Dal.

841
01:03:10,590 --> 01:03:13,230
When you return to your own body, without any hesitation,

842
01:03:14,500 --> 01:03:17,330
and without any lingering regrets, let Dal go.

843
01:03:28,610 --> 01:03:31,210
My feelings for you cannot be allowed to hold you down.

844
01:03:34,680 --> 01:03:36,220
I must hide them deep inside.

845
01:03:38,750 --> 01:03:40,650
Without leaving a single trace.

846
01:03:43,060 --> 01:03:44,590
So that not even my shadow gives me away.

847
01:03:52,600 --> 01:03:54,440
This must be why our bodies switched.

848
01:03:55,700 --> 01:03:57,140
So I would get hurt instead of you.

849
01:03:59,170 --> 01:04:01,240
So I would experience all this humiliation myself.

850
01:04:01,880 --> 01:04:04,180
I am never to escape the guilt I feel toward the Crown Princess.

851
01:04:16,120 --> 01:04:17,259
You think this was just a reminder...

852
01:04:17,260 --> 01:04:18,390
of your guilt about the late Crown Princess?

853
01:04:23,200 --> 01:04:27,270
I know you are the Crown Prince and think the world is all about you.

854
01:04:27,740 --> 01:04:30,570
But I am the main character of my own life, you know.

855
01:04:30,900 --> 01:04:34,480
Do not use someone's life as a prop for your drama, Your Highness!

856
01:04:35,310 --> 01:04:36,840
What is with this sudden outburst?

857
01:04:36,910 --> 01:04:38,810
You want to know why I protect you, Your Highness?

858
01:04:39,210 --> 01:04:41,620
It is because protecting you is how I protect my own body.

859
01:04:42,120 --> 01:04:43,620
I could not take care of my own body,

860
01:04:43,650 --> 01:04:45,120
and you could not care for others.

861
01:04:45,220 --> 01:04:48,390
So the skies gave us this punishment to learn from each other. Got it?

862
01:05:06,170 --> 01:05:07,439
- Se Dol.
- Yes?

863
01:05:07,440 --> 01:05:09,509
Do you know where the diaries or love letters I wrote...

864
01:05:09,510 --> 01:05:10,780
to the late Crown Princess are?

865
01:05:10,940 --> 01:05:14,210
If that is what you are looking for, they should be over here.

866
01:05:14,480 --> 01:05:15,720
- What?
- This way.

867
01:05:21,590 --> 01:05:22,920
Right under my nose.

868
01:05:24,120 --> 01:05:26,260
Is this some kind of safe?

869
01:05:26,390 --> 01:05:29,860
Why are you asking me? You put it there, Your Highness.

870
01:05:41,810 --> 01:05:44,180
What? What is that?

871
01:05:52,420 --> 01:05:53,420
What?

872
01:05:56,160 --> 01:05:58,630
- No...
- Is this not mine now?

873
01:05:59,060 --> 01:06:01,030
So I will do whatever I want with it.

874
01:06:05,000 --> 01:06:06,630
Wait, why is this here?

875
01:06:06,830 --> 01:06:10,900
You are the one who picked it up. Why ask me, Your Royal Highness?

876
01:06:17,810 --> 01:06:20,880
Here is the diary you wrote to the late Crown Princess.

877
01:06:21,250 --> 01:06:23,420
But why are you suddenly looking for this?

878
01:06:23,980 --> 01:06:25,820
That love letter they claim is proof of Dal's affair,

879
01:06:26,350 --> 01:06:27,450
I wrote it.

880
01:06:30,020 --> 01:06:32,660
Why so surprised? I probably wrote it to the Crown Princess,

881
01:06:35,000 --> 01:06:36,400
not Dal.

882
01:06:39,270 --> 01:06:40,430
If I show them this,

883
01:06:41,340 --> 01:06:43,170
I should be able to clear Dal's name.

884
01:06:43,470 --> 01:06:45,770
If you say you wrote that love letter, Your Royal Highness,

885
01:06:46,510 --> 01:06:48,940
do you think the Queen Dowager will buy it?

886
01:06:49,240 --> 01:06:53,580
She will find a way to twist this and make Dal a royal concubine.

887
01:06:54,380 --> 01:06:56,250
We have to put out the most urgent fire first.

888
01:08:01,520 --> 01:08:02,780
Sleep eludes me.

889
01:08:04,150 --> 01:08:06,620
I thought it was my bedding that was uncomfortable,

890
01:08:07,550 --> 01:08:08,720
but it must be my heart.

891
01:08:09,920 --> 01:08:12,030
The night is dark, and the moon is bright,

892
01:08:12,860 --> 01:08:17,760
so why, as if shrouded in clouds, is my heart so bleak?

893
01:08:21,600 --> 01:08:23,000
I am not myself,

894
01:08:24,000 --> 01:08:25,370
and you are not yourself.

895
01:08:27,610 --> 01:08:30,940
And in the empty space, a dull longing stretches, settles.

896
01:08:32,750 --> 01:08:34,550
Will finding what I have lost be enough?

897
01:08:35,680 --> 01:08:37,380
Will returning to my rightful place be enough?

898
01:08:39,690 --> 01:08:40,890
Only then...

899
01:08:42,860 --> 01:08:43,920
will I finally find peace?

900
01:08:50,460 --> 01:08:51,870
Maybe this feeling...

901
01:08:54,770 --> 01:08:56,170
is not for the Crown Princess...

902
01:08:57,940 --> 01:08:59,040
but for me.

903
01:09:05,810 --> 01:09:07,350
What is the meaning of this?

904
01:09:08,050 --> 01:09:11,920
How could Prince Un's love letter be found in Park Dal's quarters?

905
01:09:12,750 --> 01:09:15,490
Do you think I spared her life for this?

906
01:09:16,720 --> 01:09:19,630
For the sin of daring to insult and betray me,

907
01:09:20,730 --> 01:09:24,400
- I will make her pay dearly for it!
- I wrote that letter.

908
01:09:26,670 --> 01:09:31,970
You are saying you wrote a love letter to that girl?

909
01:09:32,570 --> 01:09:33,610
Pardon me?

910
01:09:35,640 --> 01:09:39,380
It was not a love letter. It was just a poem.

911
01:09:40,480 --> 01:09:44,890
So, though you fancied her enough to write her a poem,

912
01:09:45,050 --> 01:09:47,320
she rejected your royal favour?

913
01:09:48,390 --> 01:09:49,459
She would charge you with the crime...

914
01:09:49,460 --> 01:09:50,490
of refusing the Crown Prince's favour...

915
01:09:50,690 --> 01:09:52,930
and threaten to have you beheaded.

916
01:09:54,490 --> 01:09:56,460
Answer me, Crown Prince!

917
01:09:56,830 --> 01:09:58,670
Dal never refused.

918
01:10:00,630 --> 01:10:01,640
In that case,

919
01:10:01,940 --> 01:10:06,470
are you planning to take Park Dal as your Royal Concubine?

920
01:10:10,940 --> 01:10:11,950
Yes.

921
01:10:12,610 --> 01:10:16,280
I will take Dal as my Royal Concubine.

922
01:10:18,220 --> 01:10:19,720
Court Lady Yoon!

923
01:10:20,750 --> 01:10:21,790
Yes, Your Highness!

924
01:10:23,290 --> 01:10:25,790
Have Park Dal released at once.

925
01:10:26,230 --> 01:10:28,500
I am issuing a decree to make her a Royal Concubine.

926
01:10:30,060 --> 01:10:31,100
About that...

927
01:10:33,130 --> 01:10:37,000
The Chief Court Lady ordered Park Dal to be flogged.

928
01:10:37,900 --> 01:10:39,070
Flogged, you say?

929
01:10:39,570 --> 01:10:40,840
Right now...

930
01:11:21,920 --> 01:11:24,280
- Your Highness!
- Stop this at once!

931
01:12:05,330 --> 01:12:07,030
Your Royal Highness!

932
01:12:08,060 --> 01:12:10,330
Your Royal Highness.

933
01:12:11,000 --> 01:12:12,000
Your Royal Highness.

934
01:12:12,800 --> 01:12:14,200
Please pull yourself together.

935
01:12:15,140 --> 01:12:16,140
Your Royal Highness...

936
01:12:31,280 --> 01:12:32,290
My body...

937
01:12:34,390 --> 01:12:35,860
I am back in my own body.

938
01:12:36,360 --> 01:12:37,360
Yes.

939
01:12:39,190 --> 01:12:40,330
We are back.

940
01:12:42,300 --> 01:12:43,300
We are back.

941
01:12:47,630 --> 01:12:48,640
Dal!

942
01:12:49,440 --> 01:12:51,400
Dal!

943
01:12:53,170 --> 01:12:54,170
Dal!

944
01:13:15,630 --> 01:13:16,900
Please kill me.

945
01:13:20,700 --> 01:13:21,740
Gladly.

946
01:13:25,670 --> 01:13:27,670
I will kill every last one of you!

947
01:13:30,480 --> 01:13:35,620
(Moon River)

948
01:13:50,660 --> 01:13:54,230
From now on, I will be your shield. You just hide behind me.

949
01:13:54,300 --> 01:13:56,199
Do not give your heart to the Crown Prince.

950
01:13:56,200 --> 01:13:59,010
To survive and be loved, win his.

951
01:13:59,070 --> 01:14:01,740
Are you telling me to kill the Crown Prince?

952
01:14:01,780 --> 01:14:03,810
There is a distillery at the foot of Mount Inwang.

953
01:14:03,910 --> 01:14:08,180
Why would you burden your soft heart with yet another weakness?

954
01:14:08,250 --> 01:14:09,980
- Goodness!
- Dal!

955
01:14:19,690 --> 01:14:21,730
Since you came rushing here so frantically,

956
01:14:22,000 --> 01:14:24,360
it left me no choice but to banish Grand Prince Je Un.

957
01:14:36,780 --> 01:14:40,750
They say the art of bonsai is in the pruning.

958
01:14:42,850 --> 01:14:46,490
To keep it from growing twisted or wild,

959
01:14:47,120 --> 01:14:50,120
it must allow its branches to be cut to conform and survive.

960
01:14:53,590 --> 01:14:55,660
You always told me, Father,

961
01:14:56,430 --> 01:14:59,600
that I should be the flower blooming at the highest peak in Joseon.

962
01:15:07,070 --> 01:15:08,440
I am here to yield.

963
01:15:08,810 --> 01:15:12,610
As you have always wished, Father, I will live like that flower.

964
01:15:17,220 --> 01:15:18,890
So, please spare Grand Prince Je Un's life.

965
01:15:54,120 --> 01:15:58,260
(Moon River)
