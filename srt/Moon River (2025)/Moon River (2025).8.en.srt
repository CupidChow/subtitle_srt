1
00:00:08,140 --> 00:00:13,050
(Moon River)

2
00:00:13,510 --> 00:00:15,020
Please kill me!

3
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:17,020
Gladly.

4
00:00:20,850 --> 00:00:22,720
I will kill every last one of you!

5
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:26,630
The Queen Dowager has arrived!

6
00:00:29,330 --> 00:00:32,030
You dared to conspire against the Royal Relatives...

7
00:00:32,370 --> 00:00:34,570
and bring harm to the Crown Prince.

8
00:00:34,970 --> 00:00:38,910
- Arrest this traitor. - Harming His Royal Highness was...

9
00:00:39,270 --> 00:00:40,840
the fault of my subordinate.

10
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:43,880
And I had proof of the affair.

11
00:00:43,940 --> 00:00:47,880
That love letter... The Crown Prince wrote it to Park Dal.

12
00:00:48,550 --> 00:00:52,550
- What are you doing? Seize her now. - Arrest her immediately!

13
00:00:52,690 --> 00:00:53,690
- Yes, Your Majesty. - Yes, Your Majesty.

14
00:00:56,860 --> 00:00:58,090
I have been wronged.

15
00:00:59,060 --> 00:01:01,560
Your Majesty, I have been wronged!

16
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,200
Your Majesty, I have been wronged.

17
00:01:28,620 --> 00:01:31,460
The letter you brought as proof of an affair...

18
00:01:31,790 --> 00:01:34,390
was confirmed that it was written by His Highness, the Crown Prince.

19
00:01:35,730 --> 00:01:36,860
So what brings you here now?

20
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:40,370
There is no place in this place for you, Grand Prince Je Un.

21
00:01:41,540 --> 00:01:42,900
Therefore, you must leave.

22
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:47,010
Did you not know? I already live outside the palace.

23
00:01:47,510 --> 00:01:49,980
Then, I shall return to my home.

24
00:02:01,150 --> 00:02:03,559
Left State Councillor. Please give me one more chance.

25
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:05,960
I will not fail you this time!

26
00:02:06,060 --> 00:02:08,299
- My lord! - Careless words...

27
00:02:08,300 --> 00:02:10,530
can bring great harm.

28
00:02:12,030 --> 00:02:15,600
(Chapter Eight: Silence is Golden)

29
00:02:20,370 --> 00:02:23,080
Your Royal Highness, let a court lady do that.

30
00:02:23,740 --> 00:02:24,880
I will do it myself.

31
00:02:26,150 --> 00:02:27,350
I will do it.

32
00:02:27,380 --> 00:02:30,280
And what should I do with Court Lady Park's things?

33
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:31,920
Get rid of them.

34
00:02:33,390 --> 00:02:36,860
- She will not need them anymore. - What do you mean?

35
00:02:45,230 --> 00:02:47,600
Then should I get rid of this scent pouch too?

36
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:49,370
Leave that.

37
00:02:50,370 --> 00:02:51,840
It is evidence that the man behind the Choraengi Mask dropped.

38
00:02:52,110 --> 00:02:53,840
But this scent pouch...

39
00:02:54,110 --> 00:02:55,210
Last year,

40
00:02:55,740 --> 00:02:57,879
His Majesty gave these to palace staff...

41
00:02:57,880 --> 00:03:00,180
to celebrate Queen Dowager's birthday.

42
00:03:00,580 --> 00:03:02,780
How could the man behind the Choraengi Mask have one?

43
00:03:03,250 --> 00:03:05,720
What? Palace staff?

44
00:03:06,150 --> 00:03:07,920
This is the entry and exit log...

45
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:09,720
of the palace staff's from the last six months.

46
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:14,230
But why did you have me bring this?

47
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:16,230
We could have just inspected all of the staff's scent pouches.

48
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,130
This scent pouch is his?

49
00:03:20,530 --> 00:03:22,740
Scent pouches are typically used by women.

50
00:03:32,650 --> 00:03:33,710
The Choraengi Mask?

51
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:35,720
A sack?

52
00:03:38,220 --> 00:03:39,220
Five.

53
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:44,160
One.

54
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:51,060
Once every five days.

55
00:03:51,430 --> 00:03:53,830
You traded poisonous insects with the Choraengi Mask.

56
00:03:54,230 --> 00:03:55,240
Is that correct?

57
00:03:57,070 --> 00:03:58,310
Find a court lady...

58
00:03:58,610 --> 00:04:00,510
who left between 9pm and 1am every 5 days.

59
00:04:01,710 --> 00:04:02,740
This...

60
00:04:03,110 --> 00:04:04,210
You want me to search through all of this?

61
00:04:04,580 --> 00:04:07,650
This is tyranny and an abuse of power.

62
00:04:08,220 --> 00:04:10,950
It is not an abuse of power when the Crown Prince does it.

63
00:04:11,390 --> 00:04:12,390
Besides,

64
00:04:13,290 --> 00:04:16,120
you would rather be looking through this log...

65
00:04:16,190 --> 00:04:18,690
than at your name in the death book, would you not?

66
00:04:24,060 --> 00:04:25,700
(Jo Myeong Im)

67
00:04:27,230 --> 00:04:28,770
(Jo Myeong Im)

68
00:04:35,740 --> 00:04:38,610
Over the past 3 months, once every 5 days,

69
00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:42,120
only one person left regularly at 9pm or 1am.

70
00:04:47,850 --> 00:04:49,560
Where is the Chief Court Lady now?

71
00:05:07,470 --> 00:05:09,440
This was found in the Chief Court Lady's quarters.

72
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:13,080
So the Chief Court Lady really was the Choraengi Mask.

73
00:05:19,890 --> 00:05:21,520
The Left State Councillor's blade...

74
00:05:22,260 --> 00:05:23,620
knows no hesitation.

75
00:05:24,890 --> 00:05:26,960
Tell the Police Bureau to watch the snake catchers.

76
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:29,630
He will need to procure food for the Jimjo,

77
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:32,830
so he will be looking for new catchers.

78
00:05:33,230 --> 00:05:35,070
If we move on them without reason,

79
00:05:35,100 --> 00:05:36,870
the Left State Councillor will not approve.

80
00:05:36,970 --> 00:05:40,410
Yes, that is too rash. If you could please reconsider...

81
00:05:40,470 --> 00:05:41,480
There is...

82
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:44,710
There is no time.

83
00:05:45,910 --> 00:05:48,620
I must end this before the Left State Councillor harms Dal.

84
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:51,920
I have to do something!

85
00:06:07,230 --> 00:06:08,500
It is mine.

86
00:06:11,870 --> 00:06:13,140
It is mine.

87
00:06:36,030 --> 00:06:37,030
This...

88
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:41,300
I received this before I entered the palace.

89
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:44,300
This one thing...

90
00:06:47,140 --> 00:06:48,340
is mine.

91
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:51,880
Dal.

92
00:06:52,380 --> 00:06:54,710
Dal, are you all right? Dal.

93
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:57,380
Dal, are you all right?

94
00:07:03,860 --> 00:07:06,390
This will not do. I will go get the Royal Physician.

95
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,070
Why am I here?

96
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:15,200
Have we not switched back?

97
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:21,640
Here, calm down and look. It is my face.

98
00:07:33,750 --> 00:07:34,820
But...

99
00:07:36,490 --> 00:07:38,260
how did we switch back then?

100
00:07:39,730 --> 00:07:40,960
I am not sure either.

101
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:45,030
When I came to after being whipped, we had already switched back.

102
00:07:48,900 --> 00:07:52,270
When we switched bodies before, we were not whipped.

103
00:07:56,780 --> 00:07:58,410
Still, it is a relief...

104
00:07:59,050 --> 00:08:00,250
that we have switched back.

105
00:08:02,450 --> 00:08:03,680
How can you be smiling right now?

106
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:05,350
What do you want me to do?

107
00:08:05,790 --> 00:08:08,420
- I had to save you. - Who asked you to save me?

108
00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:13,890
Since I got tangled up with you, I have not had a moment's peace.

109
00:08:14,330 --> 00:08:16,230
And do you have any idea how many times I nearly died?

110
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,500
I cannot stand to see you like this by my side.

111
00:08:25,910 --> 00:08:27,010
In any case,

112
00:08:27,540 --> 00:08:29,540
we agreed I would leave once we switched back.

113
00:08:30,410 --> 00:08:31,610
Who said you could leave?

114
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:37,980
I am going to make you my concubine.

115
00:08:41,190 --> 00:08:42,820
I have to keep you in my sight.

116
00:08:43,820 --> 00:08:46,630
I need to keep you close so I know you are safe.

117
00:08:47,460 --> 00:08:48,660
From now on,

118
00:08:49,430 --> 00:08:50,560
I will be your shield,

119
00:08:51,830 --> 00:08:53,070
and you will hide behind me.

120
00:08:55,970 --> 00:08:57,640
Until that shield is broken.

121
00:09:04,540 --> 00:09:08,150
I told you to stay at my chambers. Why did you insist on coming here?

122
00:09:09,620 --> 00:09:13,050
You were just dying for your silk bed, were you not?

123
00:09:13,850 --> 00:09:17,160
Now that you have switched back, you can enjoy it all you want.

124
00:09:19,060 --> 00:09:22,360
As if there is only one silk bed in this whole palace.

125
00:09:51,620 --> 00:09:55,730
Here. I hope this eases your pain, even just a little.

126
00:10:01,130 --> 00:10:04,640
You are in no condition to be up. Lie down. I will leave you to rest.

127
00:10:16,950 --> 00:10:17,950
Actually...

128
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:19,320
Yes? What is it?

129
00:10:19,590 --> 00:10:22,260
- Is there something you need? - No, that is not it.

130
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:24,390
It is just something I was wondering.

131
00:10:27,260 --> 00:10:28,260
It is about...

132
00:10:29,130 --> 00:10:30,930
that Four Frames of Life painting.

133
00:10:31,900 --> 00:10:32,900
What?

134
00:10:32,901 --> 00:10:34,630
Why did you put it in that love letter?

135
00:10:38,670 --> 00:10:39,870
You know,

136
00:10:40,340 --> 00:10:42,540
the one that goes, "The night is dark, and the moon is bright."

137
00:10:42,710 --> 00:10:45,980
Or whatever. That one.

138
00:10:46,550 --> 00:10:48,820
In a letter so cheesy,

139
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:53,350
why did you tuck in a drawing...

140
00:10:55,090 --> 00:10:56,290
of the two of us?

141
00:11:04,460 --> 00:11:05,630
That is...

142
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:07,830
The thing is...

143
00:11:19,310 --> 00:11:22,820
The Left State Councillor will make bolder attempts to harm Dal.

144
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:25,390
Instead of a hasty confession,

145
00:11:26,190 --> 00:11:27,920
taking down the Left State Councillor must come first.

146
00:11:33,490 --> 00:11:35,330
There was nowhere else to put it.

147
00:11:40,630 --> 00:11:42,100
Then I guess...

148
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:43,739
you are making me a Royal Concubine...

149
00:11:43,740 --> 00:11:44,840
because there is nowhere else for me.

150
00:11:45,210 --> 00:11:47,609
You must stay by my side until I find evidence...

151
00:11:47,610 --> 00:11:49,180
and take down the Left State Councillor.

152
00:11:49,980 --> 00:11:51,580
You were hurt because of me,

153
00:11:52,450 --> 00:11:53,750
so I have to take responsibility.

154
00:12:11,060 --> 00:12:12,530
What am I, bruised fruit?

155
00:12:14,370 --> 00:12:15,670
Or a cracked pot?

156
00:12:16,700 --> 00:12:18,870
And what is all this about making me a concubine because I got hurt?

157
00:12:20,770 --> 00:12:23,780
And what about "until I take down the Left State Councillor" part?

158
00:12:24,340 --> 00:12:27,180
Once you are done with him, will you just toss me aside too?

159
00:12:29,380 --> 00:12:30,750
And I thought maybe his heart...

160
00:12:31,750 --> 00:12:34,590
was for me, not the Crown Princess.

161
00:12:35,890 --> 00:12:38,160
Talk about counting my chickens before they hatched.

162
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:45,330
It really stings.

163
00:12:49,070 --> 00:12:50,070
Goodness.

164
00:12:52,810 --> 00:12:54,940
Why on earth am I hurting inside and out?

165
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:57,480
This is just miserable.

166
00:12:58,180 --> 00:12:59,280
A Royal Concubine?

167
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:01,919
Do you think the Left State Councillor will just sit by...

168
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:03,520
if you bring in a concubine before the Royal Wedding?

169
00:13:03,780 --> 00:13:06,190
I am no longer afraid of the Left State Councillor.

170
00:13:07,020 --> 00:13:09,590
He would kill his own people without a second thought.

171
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:12,430
I must protect Dal.

172
00:13:13,790 --> 00:13:15,030
This time, I swear...

173
00:13:17,260 --> 00:13:18,770
I will protect her at all costs.

174
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:30,640
Please help me.

175
00:13:33,250 --> 00:13:34,350
Father.

176
00:13:43,490 --> 00:13:44,520
Your Majesty.

177
00:13:48,530 --> 00:13:50,830
What parent can ever win against their child?

178
00:14:02,840 --> 00:14:04,180
I hereby appoint Park Dal...

179
00:14:05,550 --> 00:14:07,950
as Crown Prince's Concubine of the Junior Fifth Rank.

180
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:26,730
From this day forward, this girl will be attending to you.

181
00:14:28,130 --> 00:14:31,040
I am Yeon Sim of the Hong clan. I will serve you devotedly.

182
00:14:32,870 --> 00:14:34,410
Thank you. I'm counting on you too.

183
00:14:34,770 --> 00:14:39,110
You must address her informally. To do otherwise is against protocol.

184
00:14:39,450 --> 00:14:40,880
But we have only just met.

185
00:14:40,950 --> 00:14:44,280
How can you say that when I brought your former roommate?

186
00:14:47,650 --> 00:14:48,990
I see.

187
00:14:49,220 --> 00:14:52,130
Right, right.

188
00:14:52,490 --> 00:14:53,660
But...

189
00:14:54,090 --> 00:14:57,330
why are you suddenly speaking with an accent?

190
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:00,230
It is just...

191
00:15:02,670 --> 00:15:03,900
Your Royal Highness.

192
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:10,080
Well,

193
00:15:10,740 --> 00:15:12,110
did you sleep well?

194
00:15:12,410 --> 00:15:13,410
Yes.

195
00:15:14,350 --> 00:15:15,980
I did.

196
00:15:22,590 --> 00:15:23,820
You have...

197
00:15:25,390 --> 00:15:26,430
put your hair up.

198
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:28,390
Oh, my hair...

199
00:15:29,700 --> 00:15:30,700
Yes.

200
00:15:35,900 --> 00:15:37,000
Does it look strange?

201
00:15:37,570 --> 00:15:38,940
No, it is just...

202
00:15:43,610 --> 00:15:44,780
It looks good on you.

203
00:15:55,090 --> 00:15:58,790
Your Royal Highness.

204
00:16:00,990 --> 00:16:02,330
- What is it? - Hurry.

205
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:03,930
What is all the fuss about? What is it?

206
00:16:16,740 --> 00:16:18,880
- Your Royal Highness. - What has happened here?

207
00:16:18,980 --> 00:16:21,710
Poisonous insects were found in the jar, Your Highness.

208
00:16:21,980 --> 00:16:23,819
They are from the medicinal food merchants,

209
00:16:23,820 --> 00:16:25,650
so perhaps there was a mix-up.

210
00:16:25,820 --> 00:16:27,550
I will launch an investigation at once.

211
00:16:27,850 --> 00:16:29,190
Cheonghye Merchant Guild?

212
00:16:29,590 --> 00:16:31,060
Who manages the deliveries from the merchant guilds?

213
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:32,930
The previous Chief Court Lady was in charge of it.

214
00:16:39,230 --> 00:16:40,530
Where are you going?

215
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:43,700
If its food has appeared, then the creature must be here too.

216
00:16:43,900 --> 00:16:45,610
Do you have any idea where it could be?

217
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:52,650
A place known only to the Chief Court Lady.

218
00:16:55,250 --> 00:16:56,750
Somewhere dark and damp within the palace.

219
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:05,320
No way. This tiny little thing is the Jimjo?

220
00:17:07,060 --> 00:17:08,160
It is a fledgling.

221
00:17:08,760 --> 00:17:11,700
- We have to find the mother. - Now we have found its young,

222
00:17:12,100 --> 00:17:14,400
will this not be enough to implicate the Left State Councillor?

223
00:17:14,470 --> 00:17:18,340
The log, the feather from her room, and now this secret cell.

224
00:17:18,940 --> 00:17:22,340
It all fits a little too perfectly that she is the owner of the Jimjo.

225
00:17:22,440 --> 00:17:23,580
That is true.

226
00:17:24,110 --> 00:17:26,150
There is no evidence linking her to the Left State Councillor.

227
00:17:26,280 --> 00:17:27,480
This Jimjo chick...

228
00:17:28,180 --> 00:17:29,950
is a taunt and a warning from the Left State Councillor.

229
00:17:31,550 --> 00:17:34,450
So he planned to use her as a scapegoat from the beginning.

230
00:17:34,550 --> 00:17:35,560
What is more,

231
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:39,990
it is a warning to stop digging into the Gyesa Year Incident.

232
00:17:51,070 --> 00:17:54,570
As you commanded, I have made sure all the evidence...

233
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:55,980
points to the Chief Court Lady as the owner.

234
00:17:58,510 --> 00:18:01,110
The entry log, the feather in her quarters,

235
00:18:01,580 --> 00:18:04,080
and the Jimjo's food have all been planted.

236
00:18:06,050 --> 00:18:07,090
By now,

237
00:18:08,350 --> 00:18:10,990
our dear Crown Prince must be quite confused.

238
00:18:11,660 --> 00:18:16,200
But is it really okay for the Crown Prince to have found the Jimjo?

239
00:18:17,260 --> 00:18:19,270
Since the Jimjo was found inside the palace,

240
00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:22,600
he will not be so quick to reveal its existence.

241
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:25,200
More importantly,

242
00:18:27,070 --> 00:18:30,640
I ordered you to kill everyone involved with my Jimjo.

243
00:18:31,310 --> 00:18:33,210
How does the Crown Prince know about you?

244
00:18:33,680 --> 00:18:35,650
Why is he checking snake catchers?

245
00:18:42,660 --> 00:18:45,020
Did a dead man start talking? Is that it?

246
00:18:46,060 --> 00:18:49,400
Is someone I had killed still alive? Is that what happened?

247
00:18:50,630 --> 00:18:51,760
Please kill me.

248
00:18:54,830 --> 00:18:57,100
Do not disappoint me again.

249
00:18:57,870 --> 00:19:01,510
Your mother deserves to be free, does she not?

250
00:19:02,040 --> 00:19:04,240
Yes, Your Excellency.

251
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:08,810
A Jimjo chick was found inside the palace.

252
00:19:09,080 --> 00:19:12,390
Do you know a way to use the chick to find its mother?

253
00:19:12,690 --> 00:19:14,750
How could a Jimjo chick have come from the palace?

254
00:19:19,030 --> 00:19:22,330
- Why are you looking at me? - Only you speak Qing, Highness.

255
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:23,900
What makes you think I can speak their language?

256
00:19:23,960 --> 00:19:26,570
Gang. You understand the Qing language?

257
00:19:27,670 --> 00:19:28,700
Well...

258
00:19:29,270 --> 00:19:30,570
I picked some up here and there.

259
00:19:36,710 --> 00:19:39,810
Hey, last time we met, I noticed you can speak Joseon,

260
00:19:40,210 --> 00:19:41,450
so just speak in Joseon.

261
00:19:41,710 --> 00:19:45,420
Why must I yield to you as the Crown Prince? I have my pride.

262
00:19:47,150 --> 00:19:50,820
Your Royal Highness, he might change his mind anytime.

263
00:19:51,060 --> 00:19:52,690
You should set aside your pride for now...

264
00:19:53,030 --> 00:19:55,490
and get the information we need first.

265
00:19:56,500 --> 00:19:59,300
- No, I mean... - The chick...

266
00:19:59,770 --> 00:20:01,800
- The chick? - It cannot kill people.

267
00:20:02,130 --> 00:20:03,799
That is why its mother protects it.

268
00:20:03,800 --> 00:20:04,900
I see.

269
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:07,440
Its venom is weak, so the mother protects it.

270
00:20:08,610 --> 00:20:10,580
Is he talking about maternal instinct?

271
00:20:10,910 --> 00:20:12,610
A long time ago, a chick was sold far away.

272
00:20:13,210 --> 00:20:15,820
Its mother found it and brought it back home.

273
00:20:16,780 --> 00:20:17,850
Home? You mean...

274
00:20:19,220 --> 00:20:20,990
It would return to the place it was confined?

275
00:20:40,970 --> 00:20:42,340
A homing instinct?

276
00:20:44,180 --> 00:20:48,880
You said it was sold far away. How far exactly?

277
00:20:51,480 --> 00:20:52,490
The next village over.

278
00:20:53,590 --> 00:20:54,690
About 8km.

279
00:20:57,220 --> 00:20:58,560
About 8km?

280
00:20:59,930 --> 00:21:01,060
What is it, Your Highness?

281
00:21:01,460 --> 00:21:03,730
For the mother to fetch its chick from 8km away,

282
00:21:04,630 --> 00:21:07,400
it must have heard the chick's cries and come for it.

283
00:21:07,930 --> 00:21:09,000
Which means...

284
00:21:10,770 --> 00:21:13,010
the chick should be able to hear its mother's cries too.

285
00:21:19,350 --> 00:21:22,850
For now, our best bet is to use the chick to find its mother.

286
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:27,020
Since adult Jimjo birds are large and usually kept in mountain caves,

287
00:21:27,350 --> 00:21:28,650
we will search the nearby mountains...

288
00:21:34,660 --> 00:21:35,930
Wait a moment.

289
00:21:37,030 --> 00:21:38,600
I need to speak with her.

290
00:21:42,800 --> 00:21:45,600
You promised to send Dal away when your bodies switched.

291
00:21:45,710 --> 00:21:47,170
But now she is a Royal Concubine?

292
00:21:47,770 --> 00:21:51,740
Did I not tell you? I told you you could not protect Dal!

293
00:21:54,050 --> 00:21:55,550
Something has felt off all along.

294
00:21:56,150 --> 00:21:57,949
The fact that you planned to flee to Qing when I, the Crown Prince,

295
00:21:57,950 --> 00:21:59,720
promised I would protect Dal.

296
00:22:00,350 --> 00:22:03,659
You believed that absurd tale about our bodies switching.

297
00:22:03,660 --> 00:22:04,720
And now,

298
00:22:05,830 --> 00:22:09,030
your desperate attempts to keep me and Dal apart.

299
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:20,140
Just like with the Crown Princess five years ago,

300
00:22:21,570 --> 00:22:23,780
do you want to lose Dal to the Left State Councillor as well?

301
00:22:27,350 --> 00:22:29,080
I am begging you, let Dal go.

302
00:22:33,420 --> 00:22:34,450
Dal...

303
00:22:36,890 --> 00:22:39,160
said she is tired of living on the run.

304
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:43,460
And I will protect her this time, no matter what.

305
00:22:44,500 --> 00:22:47,070
Both Dal and her dreams.

306
00:22:57,010 --> 00:22:58,140
A Crown Prince's concubine?

307
00:22:58,840 --> 00:23:00,680
With the Royal Wedding just days away,

308
00:23:00,850 --> 00:23:01,980
he is taking a concubine?

309
00:23:03,080 --> 00:23:07,450
He defies you, Left State Councillor!

310
00:23:07,590 --> 00:23:11,590
How can you be so calm? What if she bears him a son?

311
00:23:12,090 --> 00:23:13,760
Is there anyone more troublesome...

312
00:23:14,030 --> 00:23:16,760
than the firstborn son of a Royal Concubine?

313
00:23:18,130 --> 00:23:19,300
Just wait and see.

314
00:23:20,370 --> 00:23:24,640
After all, there is no stronger leash than a weakness.

315
00:23:27,010 --> 00:23:29,880
- Your Highness! Left State... - Unbelievable.

316
00:23:30,140 --> 00:23:32,879
He has tossed propriety to the dogs, has he not?

317
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:35,180
Your Royal Highness, this is not about propriety now.

318
00:23:35,410 --> 00:23:37,049
It is the Left State Councillor.

319
00:23:37,050 --> 00:23:40,390
With Concubine Park... He is...

320
00:23:43,160 --> 00:23:46,860
We meet again, Lady Park.

321
00:23:47,690 --> 00:23:50,100
Left State Councillor. What brings you all the way here?

322
00:23:50,230 --> 00:23:53,570
I came to apologise for my rudeness during the recent interrogation...

323
00:23:54,030 --> 00:23:56,440
and to congratulate you on becoming a Royal Concubine.

324
00:23:56,700 --> 00:23:58,900
And for a few other reasons.

325
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:02,710
- I also had something to confirm. - Confirm what?

326
00:24:09,050 --> 00:24:10,380
That is all right.

327
00:24:11,250 --> 00:24:13,020
I have already confirmed what I needed to.

328
00:24:16,790 --> 00:24:17,860
Your Royal Highness.

329
00:24:28,430 --> 00:24:30,470
What brings you here all of a sudden?

330
00:24:32,370 --> 00:24:35,410
To what do we owe the honour, Your Royal Highness?

331
00:24:38,940 --> 00:24:41,449
A state councillor meeting the Royal Concubine alone...

332
00:24:41,450 --> 00:24:42,619
in broad daylight...

333
00:24:42,620 --> 00:24:44,850
I was worried it might cause talk, so I came.

334
00:24:45,680 --> 00:24:48,850
I am moved by Your Royal Highness's concern for me,

335
00:24:49,150 --> 00:24:50,960
I could weep.

336
00:24:55,290 --> 00:24:56,760
Lady Park, you may leave us.

337
00:24:57,860 --> 00:24:58,860
Pardon?

338
00:25:09,540 --> 00:25:10,540
Yes, Your Highness.

339
00:25:23,620 --> 00:25:25,930
Then I, too, shall take my leave.

340
00:25:28,030 --> 00:25:29,300
But, Your Royal Highness.

341
00:25:30,130 --> 00:25:34,830
Why take on another weakness with that soft heart of yours?

342
00:25:36,800 --> 00:25:37,970
What do you...

343
00:25:38,170 --> 00:25:42,010
A person's greatest weakness is love.

344
00:25:42,570 --> 00:25:44,640
Did I not tell you so?

345
00:25:45,680 --> 00:25:49,080
I shall take my leave.

346
00:25:49,550 --> 00:25:53,920
I lost the Crown Princess, and with her, my laughter and love.

347
00:25:54,820 --> 00:25:56,520
This concubine appointment is a matter of responsibility.

348
00:25:57,720 --> 00:26:01,430
As you know, Lady Park saved my life at Sinjusa.

349
00:26:01,960 --> 00:26:04,000
She is the one who saved my life and was harmed because of me.

350
00:26:04,500 --> 00:26:06,100
How could I possibly turn my back on her?

351
00:26:13,670 --> 00:26:16,780
It seems you thought you found a way to protect her from me,

352
00:26:17,680 --> 00:26:19,410
but instead, you have only been exposed.

353
00:26:20,250 --> 00:26:24,820
I am talking about your affection, which you concealed with this lie.

354
00:26:43,370 --> 00:26:45,470
What were you thinking, going to him because he summoned you?

355
00:26:45,900 --> 00:26:47,910
Have you already forgotten why you became a concubine?

356
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:53,250
How could I forget? You remind me every chance you get.

357
00:26:56,450 --> 00:26:57,850
Fine.

358
00:26:58,120 --> 00:27:01,590
I will just hole up in this pavilion so I do not get in your way.

359
00:27:06,590 --> 00:27:07,930
Just bear with it for a little longer.

360
00:27:08,830 --> 00:27:10,300
I am slowly making progress.

361
00:27:11,900 --> 00:27:14,300
You just met with the boy from Qing, did you not?

362
00:27:14,370 --> 00:27:17,140
What did he say? Is he still refusing to talk?

363
00:27:18,740 --> 00:27:21,110
It seems the chick and its mother communicate over long distances.

364
00:27:21,570 --> 00:27:23,580
Since the birds are originally from the high mountains,

365
00:27:23,840 --> 00:27:27,880
it is a plausible theory. The hunters died within three days.

366
00:27:28,410 --> 00:27:31,120
The bird must be within a three-day round trip from the capital.

367
00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:34,390
Then it is highly likely it is inside the capital.

368
00:27:34,750 --> 00:27:36,719
He hid it for five years,

369
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:38,690
so it is somewhere tied to the Left State Councillor.

370
00:27:39,630 --> 00:27:42,760
I will narrow down the locations and use the chick to find its mother.

371
00:27:43,030 --> 00:27:44,460
Once I capture the Jimjo alive...

372
00:27:44,900 --> 00:27:47,800
and prove its habitat is linked to the Left State Councillor,

373
00:27:48,300 --> 00:27:49,900
he will be finished for treason.

374
00:27:50,340 --> 00:27:53,110
- Great. What should I do? - Nothing!

375
00:27:54,340 --> 00:27:56,640
Now that I have my body back, this revenge is mine and mine alone.

376
00:27:57,180 --> 00:27:58,910
Forget half. You are not even getting a sliver.

377
00:27:59,480 --> 00:28:02,350
So, from now on, stay out of the Gyesa Year Incident.

378
00:28:03,280 --> 00:28:04,520
If you were not going to let me in on it,

379
00:28:04,980 --> 00:28:07,290
then why did you explain the plan in such detail?

380
00:28:07,390 --> 00:28:08,850
It was not a plan. It was an explanation.

381
00:28:09,220 --> 00:28:11,190
That I will finish my revenge myself without your help...

382
00:28:11,320 --> 00:28:12,830
and take down the Left State Councillor.

383
00:28:15,630 --> 00:28:16,660
Because I...

384
00:28:17,460 --> 00:28:19,200
have staked my life on this revenge.

385
00:28:30,410 --> 00:28:33,710
If you give your life for someone who is already dead,

386
00:28:35,150 --> 00:28:36,950
you will just end up with two dead people.

387
00:28:38,020 --> 00:28:39,650
The living are meant to live.

388
00:28:42,390 --> 00:28:43,420
Idiot.

389
00:28:46,630 --> 00:28:49,860
The Crown Prince's Concubine will be the Deposed Crown Princess.

390
00:28:50,330 --> 00:28:54,230
But many have already seen her body. How can we...

391
00:28:54,500 --> 00:28:57,400
What they saw was a corpse, decayed beyond recognition.

392
00:28:58,370 --> 00:29:02,510
Public opinion is more powerful than evidence.

393
00:29:03,980 --> 00:29:06,750
People lose their lives over false accusations of adultery,

394
00:29:08,380 --> 00:29:10,620
and a poisoning can be twisted into a curse.

395
00:29:11,420 --> 00:29:16,260
So why would they not believe someone dead is now alive?

396
00:29:18,420 --> 00:29:21,730
I will reach the concubine's neighbours in Boryeong.

397
00:29:25,530 --> 00:29:29,130
Here are the mountains within three days of the capital.

398
00:29:31,940 --> 00:29:34,210
They must have hidden it somewhere difficult to find.

399
00:29:34,840 --> 00:29:37,740
- The chick can lead us to its mom. - Yes.

400
00:29:38,110 --> 00:29:40,410
Still, we have come a long way.

401
00:29:40,680 --> 00:29:44,020
When you think about it, it is thanks to Prince Je Un's book.

402
00:29:45,920 --> 00:29:46,950
My apologies, Your Highness.

403
00:29:48,950 --> 00:29:49,990
Do not be.

404
00:29:51,460 --> 00:29:52,990
It is not like you are wrong.

405
00:29:55,130 --> 00:29:58,400
I am glad you know Choraengi Mask is the Chief Court Lady.

406
00:29:58,860 --> 00:30:02,030
I have felt awful this whole time that I could not be of any help.

407
00:30:02,400 --> 00:30:03,800
Why are you not calling me out?

408
00:30:06,710 --> 00:30:10,540
You should ask why I took everything and then ignored our promise.

409
00:30:10,810 --> 00:30:13,210
You should be yelling at me, calling me a coward and a jerk.

410
00:30:13,750 --> 00:30:16,620
Your silence makes me want to fight with you for no reason.

411
00:30:17,880 --> 00:30:18,950
What are you talking about?

412
00:30:20,620 --> 00:30:23,520
The Choraengi Mask's identity and that the Jimjo is alive...

413
00:30:23,790 --> 00:30:25,890
I discovered all of that thanks to the book you wrote.

414
00:30:26,560 --> 00:30:29,730
I got something out of it too, so we are even for you deceiving me.

415
00:30:30,900 --> 00:30:32,200
And since we made a promise,

416
00:30:33,300 --> 00:30:34,900
I will guarantee the Crown Princess Consort's safety.

417
00:30:40,010 --> 00:30:43,040
- Thank you, Gang! - Get off me. That is disgusting.

418
00:30:44,180 --> 00:30:46,010
This is what brothers do.

419
00:30:48,110 --> 00:30:50,280
By the way, what is going on?

420
00:30:50,620 --> 00:30:52,180
What is this about Dal becoming the Crown Prince's Concubine?

421
00:30:54,490 --> 00:30:56,020
I am doing it to protect her.

422
00:30:58,120 --> 00:30:59,659
I will prove that the Left State Councillor...

423
00:30:59,660 --> 00:31:01,930
is the master of the Jimjo.

424
00:31:02,660 --> 00:31:04,730
When I do, you take the Crown Princess Consort... No.

425
00:31:06,400 --> 00:31:08,230
Take your woman's hand and run away.

426
00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:17,580
Protect your love.

427
00:33:16,430 --> 00:33:19,000
When I said you were horrible, I lied.

428
00:33:19,160 --> 00:33:21,100
And when I said I was over you,

429
00:33:24,340 --> 00:33:25,540
that was a lie.

430
00:33:28,610 --> 00:33:32,710
- Why all of a sudden? - Left State Councillor will fall.

431
00:33:33,380 --> 00:33:35,310
And you will be dragged down with him.

432
00:33:36,550 --> 00:33:40,950
- My father will not fall. - He will.

433
00:33:41,520 --> 00:33:45,360
When he does, I will take your hand and we will run away together.

434
00:33:46,430 --> 00:33:48,030
That day will never come.

435
00:33:48,430 --> 00:33:50,260
It will. It most certainly will.

436
00:33:51,660 --> 00:33:55,370
We will be happy. We must be. So please,

437
00:33:56,270 --> 00:33:58,270
trust me and just wait a little longer.

438
00:34:20,230 --> 00:34:22,390
Consummate our marriage?

439
00:34:25,960 --> 00:34:28,070
Why are they suddenly washing me?

440
00:34:29,800 --> 00:34:31,140
Do I smell or something?

441
00:34:34,910 --> 00:34:35,970
Do I?

442
00:34:38,340 --> 00:34:41,410
You are to spend the night with the Crown Prince.

443
00:34:44,250 --> 00:34:46,550
What? You mean sleep with him?

444
00:34:48,790 --> 00:34:49,860
Yes.

445
00:34:51,460 --> 00:34:53,830
Wait, hold on. I am not physically ready...

446
00:34:53,890 --> 00:34:56,129
I mean, I am not mentally prepared,

447
00:34:56,130 --> 00:34:58,230
and I just... Oh, I cannot.

448
00:34:58,300 --> 00:34:59,300
This is so mortifying.

449
00:35:12,310 --> 00:35:13,450
How are you feeling?

450
00:35:15,650 --> 00:35:18,320
- Are you feeling okay? - Yes, well...

451
00:35:20,150 --> 00:35:21,350
Yes, well...

452
00:35:21,950 --> 00:35:23,220
Well, yes.

453
00:35:24,320 --> 00:35:25,320
Good.

454
00:35:26,830 --> 00:35:27,890
That is a relief.

455
00:35:35,700 --> 00:35:37,800
Hey, what are you doing with the tie?

456
00:35:42,810 --> 00:35:45,340
It is time for bed. It is late.

457
00:36:34,260 --> 00:36:36,130
What are you waiting for? Put out the light.

458
00:36:44,500 --> 00:36:45,500
Yes.

459
00:36:46,170 --> 00:36:47,170
I will turn it off.

460
00:37:15,430 --> 00:37:17,140
Gosh, this is not going to work.

461
00:37:21,440 --> 00:37:22,440
Are you in pain?

462
00:37:25,810 --> 00:37:26,810
Your back?

463
00:37:27,510 --> 00:37:29,410
No, I am fine. It is nothing.

464
00:37:31,120 --> 00:37:32,120
You are clearly not fine.

465
00:37:33,220 --> 00:37:34,220
Goodness.

466
00:37:41,460 --> 00:37:42,460
Here is some medicine.

467
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:44,530
I will not look, so go on and apply it.

468
00:37:52,840 --> 00:37:53,940
Gosh.

469
00:37:56,140 --> 00:37:57,210
Thank you.

470
00:37:59,580 --> 00:38:01,610
- Do not look. - I am not looking.

471
00:38:24,340 --> 00:38:25,340
Gosh.

472
00:38:34,110 --> 00:38:35,450
Goodness.

473
00:38:37,420 --> 00:38:38,420
My gosh.

474
00:38:44,790 --> 00:38:45,890
Are you done?

475
00:38:46,960 --> 00:38:48,930
Hold on. It is on my back.

476
00:38:50,230 --> 00:38:53,670
You see, applying something to one's own back,

477
00:38:53,730 --> 00:38:56,800
it is not easy, anatomically. One, two...

478
00:38:59,100 --> 00:39:00,770
This is so distracting.

479
00:39:02,340 --> 00:39:03,780
Gosh, that hurts.

480
00:39:06,680 --> 00:39:08,180
You said you would not look!

481
00:39:08,810 --> 00:39:10,220
Calm down and hold still.

482
00:39:11,980 --> 00:39:12,980
Give me the ointment.

483
00:39:26,230 --> 00:39:29,130
I am just treating your wound, so do not get any funny ideas.

484
00:39:30,540 --> 00:39:32,570
What? Who said I was?

485
00:39:50,860 --> 00:39:52,390
The Queen Dowager.

486
00:39:53,490 --> 00:39:54,830
With a girl in this much pain,

487
00:39:55,360 --> 00:39:56,960
what does she expect me to do?

488
00:39:58,330 --> 00:40:00,100
It is not like I am an animal.

489
00:40:00,870 --> 00:40:03,570
Turns out I am the animal here. It was me.

490
00:40:05,270 --> 00:40:06,270
What was that?

491
00:40:06,740 --> 00:40:07,740
Nothing!

492
00:40:33,870 --> 00:40:36,200
I hate this. I really do.

493
00:40:45,010 --> 00:40:48,050
Did you hear the snake catcher family was recently wiped out?

494
00:40:48,380 --> 00:40:51,950
- They say it was the Jimjo Poison. - So I heard.

495
00:40:52,650 --> 00:40:53,990
It is terrifying. How is anyone supposed to live?

496
00:40:54,050 --> 00:40:55,450
I am telling you, a new Crown Princess is coming.

497
00:40:55,790 --> 00:40:57,890
Queen Jangjeong's vengeful spirit is running rampant.

498
00:40:58,390 --> 00:41:00,020
A woman determined to end the Royal Family's line...

499
00:41:00,090 --> 00:41:01,860
- We were just getting some soup... - No.

500
00:41:03,860 --> 00:41:05,859
It is not a curse. It is the Jimjo Poison.

501
00:41:05,860 --> 00:41:07,170
Good grief, were you not listening?

502
00:41:07,270 --> 00:41:09,599
Curse or poison, it is a bad omen.

503
00:41:09,600 --> 00:41:11,940
Something so horrid to happen right before the Royal Wedding.

504
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:15,440
Whose fault do you think it is? The new Crown Princess's, of course.

505
00:41:16,070 --> 00:41:17,740
For goodness' sake.

506
00:41:20,350 --> 00:41:24,180
Your Highness. Please do not mind such petty rumours.

507
00:41:24,380 --> 00:41:28,490
Let them gossip all they want. You will be the Crown Princess soon.

508
00:41:30,790 --> 00:41:32,820
The Chief Court Lady died recently, did she not?

509
00:41:33,630 --> 00:41:34,630
Pardon?

510
00:41:36,030 --> 00:41:37,030
Yes.

511
00:41:37,430 --> 00:41:40,830
But why bring up the Chief Court Lady all of a sudden?

512
00:41:43,800 --> 00:41:44,800
No reason.

513
00:41:46,970 --> 00:41:49,770
I just thought maybe I would not become the Crown Princess...

514
00:41:50,540 --> 00:41:51,540
after all.

515
00:41:56,280 --> 00:41:57,280
Are we...

516
00:41:58,350 --> 00:42:00,590
close enough to be holding hands?

517
00:42:01,050 --> 00:42:02,920
This is a hand held in farewell.

518
00:42:04,190 --> 00:42:06,420
Please, call off this Royal Wedding.

519
00:42:08,030 --> 00:42:10,960
This whole scenario feels awfully familiar.

520
00:42:11,860 --> 00:42:12,860
If I say no,

521
00:42:13,670 --> 00:42:14,670
are you going to shoot me again?

522
00:42:17,100 --> 00:42:18,240
It really hurt, by the way.

523
00:42:19,140 --> 00:42:20,140
Getting shot.

524
00:42:24,080 --> 00:42:26,310
If you knew everything, why did you not punish me?

525
00:42:26,640 --> 00:42:29,580
Because if you got hurt, Je Un would not be able to go on.

526
00:42:31,320 --> 00:42:32,780
I am glad you are alive.

527
00:42:35,490 --> 00:42:37,520
What is this? A sudden change of heart?

528
00:42:38,490 --> 00:42:40,960
Because Prince Je Un needs at least one family member...

529
00:42:42,460 --> 00:42:43,590
like you, Your Royal Highness.

530
00:42:45,430 --> 00:42:47,930
I followed my ambitions, so I have no regrets.

531
00:42:49,200 --> 00:42:50,800
And I intend to keep doing so.

532
00:42:53,500 --> 00:42:56,410
I will give you the crucial evidence you need to bring down my father.

533
00:42:57,810 --> 00:42:59,010
Give me your word.

534
00:42:59,580 --> 00:43:01,210
If I tell you where the Jimjo is,

535
00:43:01,780 --> 00:43:04,350
you must guarantee that Prince Je Un and I...

536
00:43:05,550 --> 00:43:06,920
will be able to escape and live in safety.

537
00:43:09,190 --> 00:43:10,190
Where is it?

538
00:43:10,760 --> 00:43:11,760
The Jimjo.

539
00:44:12,580 --> 00:44:16,020
This Jimjo is how I seized control of Joseon.

540
00:44:18,520 --> 00:44:20,960
But you know what?

541
00:44:22,190 --> 00:44:23,960
The Jimjo's true value...

542
00:44:25,400 --> 00:44:28,970
is not in its poison, but in its secrecy.

543
00:44:31,100 --> 00:44:34,170
Once its existence is known, it is no better than any poison.

544
00:44:34,840 --> 00:44:38,340
But now, rumours of the Jimjo Poison are spreading among the people.

545
00:44:39,080 --> 00:44:41,210
Did you use the Jimjo Poison on the snake catchers?

546
00:44:42,080 --> 00:44:43,780
Now that I have been exposed,

547
00:44:44,050 --> 00:44:47,390
I feared a Police Bureau inquiry would lead to the guild,

548
00:44:47,450 --> 00:44:48,490
so I made their deaths mysterious...

549
00:44:51,820 --> 00:44:52,890
The Jimjo Poison...

550
00:44:53,990 --> 00:44:56,090
should have only been used for the Gyesa Year Incident.

551
00:44:57,160 --> 00:45:00,400
The Gyesa Year Incident was meant to remain a rumour forever.

552
00:45:01,270 --> 00:45:05,640
But you have ruined everything.

553
00:45:06,270 --> 00:45:07,710
Please kill me.

554
00:45:17,920 --> 00:45:19,550
I will be the one to decide when you die.

555
00:45:21,090 --> 00:45:24,590
Seal off every secret passage connected to this place.

556
00:45:25,560 --> 00:45:27,590
And if the Crown Prince manages to find his way here,

557
00:45:29,430 --> 00:45:30,430
eliminate him.

558
00:45:33,460 --> 00:45:34,470
The Crown Prince...

559
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:36,770
You are ordering me to kill him?

560
00:45:55,420 --> 00:45:56,850
It is a beautiful day, is it not?

561
00:45:57,120 --> 00:45:59,690
- Yes. - Heard of the new royal concubine?

562
00:45:59,890 --> 00:46:01,830
So what if she got the title?

563
00:46:02,260 --> 00:46:04,500
I heard His Royal Highness has only visited her once.

564
00:46:05,260 --> 00:46:06,930
Still, I am jealous she gets to be a royal concubine.

565
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:09,669
Jealous? She is just a replacement.

566
00:46:09,670 --> 00:46:11,540
Exactly. To replace the last one.

567
00:46:13,040 --> 00:46:14,340
The nerve of those girls.

568
00:46:15,940 --> 00:46:16,940
Just ignore them.

569
00:46:18,910 --> 00:46:21,050
You see a chicken a lot more often than a pheasant, right?

570
00:46:40,030 --> 00:46:42,970
My lady, why are you out here? You should be inside.

571
00:46:56,980 --> 00:46:58,980
There is a distillery at the foot of Mount Inwang.

572
00:47:00,180 --> 00:47:01,890
It belonged to my father for a long time,

573
00:47:02,790 --> 00:47:05,220
but one day, he gave ownership to the former Chief Court Lady.

574
00:47:06,290 --> 00:47:07,360
And shortly after that,

575
00:47:08,090 --> 00:47:09,930
the Gyesa Year Incident took place.

576
00:47:12,300 --> 00:47:15,570
(The distillery)

577
00:47:15,630 --> 00:47:16,730
The distillery.

578
00:47:25,680 --> 00:47:26,680
This way.

579
00:48:43,590 --> 00:48:46,160
This is a regular cave, is it not? If it is not here,

580
00:48:46,220 --> 00:48:48,290
how could a Jimjo possibly live in that tiny house?

581
00:48:48,690 --> 00:48:51,800
There is something to this distillery. Otherwise,

582
00:48:52,100 --> 00:48:53,329
the Chief Court Lady's deed and this secret passage...

583
00:48:53,330 --> 00:48:54,570
would not make any sense.

584
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:57,570
And how do you explain the fledgling's frantic cries?

585
00:49:35,610 --> 00:49:37,940
- A rat! - Will you keep it down?

586
00:49:52,190 --> 00:49:53,190
Do you hear that?

587
00:49:54,060 --> 00:49:55,060
The sound of chains.

588
00:49:56,890 --> 00:49:58,300
There is definitely something in here.

589
00:49:58,860 --> 00:50:01,530
- The sound is getting louder. - I know.

590
00:50:15,580 --> 00:50:16,580
Darn it.

591
00:50:17,150 --> 00:50:18,550
Why did you bring that?

592
00:50:18,680 --> 00:50:21,590
We are facing the monster Jimjo. Was I supposed to come empty-handed?

593
00:50:23,150 --> 00:50:24,160
Darn.

594
00:50:26,190 --> 00:50:27,190
Gosh.

595
00:50:58,790 --> 00:51:02,530
(Yeon Wol, I will avenge you)

596
00:51:04,600 --> 00:51:05,700
This one thing...

597
00:51:06,930 --> 00:51:08,030
is mine.

598
00:51:53,040 --> 00:51:54,040
What about Dal?

599
00:51:55,550 --> 00:51:56,550
Where is Dal?

600
00:51:57,480 --> 00:51:59,920
I thought she said she would wait. Did she leave already?

601
00:52:01,390 --> 00:52:04,150
- Did she go to the Jimjo chick? - What?

602
00:52:05,160 --> 00:52:06,190
Why would Dal go there?

603
00:52:06,520 --> 00:52:08,890
- Right. It was a secret. - Spit it out!

604
00:52:10,660 --> 00:52:11,930
The thing is...

605
00:52:12,400 --> 00:52:16,700
Lady Park wanted to help with the Gyesa Year Incident.

606
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:19,600
So she guards the chick every day from the Left State Councillor.

607
00:52:19,640 --> 00:52:20,670
Your Highness!

608
00:52:30,580 --> 00:52:32,149
- Hey. - Yes?

609
00:52:32,150 --> 00:52:33,950
What were you thinking?

610
00:52:34,420 --> 00:52:36,290
How could you let Dal come here all by herself?

611
00:52:36,890 --> 00:52:39,890
What if the Left State Councillor had actually sent his men after her?

612
00:52:39,960 --> 00:52:42,430
No, of course I tried to stop her.

613
00:52:44,830 --> 00:52:45,860
Wait, but...

614
00:52:46,730 --> 00:52:47,870
If she did not come here,

615
00:52:48,970 --> 00:52:50,170
then why did she just leave?

616
00:52:56,870 --> 00:52:58,440
Why did you put ointment on my wounds?

617
00:52:59,510 --> 00:53:00,950
I hope it would hurt a little less.

618
00:53:03,080 --> 00:53:04,520
Why did you shield me?

619
00:53:04,850 --> 00:53:05,850
From now on,

620
00:53:06,820 --> 00:53:07,920
I will be your shield,

621
00:53:09,220 --> 00:53:10,390
and you will hide behind me.

622
00:53:11,420 --> 00:53:13,760
And yet, all you have left for me is a sense of duty.

623
00:53:14,060 --> 00:53:15,690
This concubine appointment is a matter of responsibility.

624
00:53:16,560 --> 00:53:18,530
She is the one who saved my life and was harmed because of me.

625
00:53:19,130 --> 00:53:20,660
How could I possibly turn my back on her?

626
00:53:35,810 --> 00:53:37,250
Is this feeling a sickness too?

627
00:53:39,080 --> 00:53:40,550
The more I fall for him,

628
00:53:42,020 --> 00:53:43,220
the more of a coward I become.

629
00:53:45,120 --> 00:53:46,120
How pathetic.

630
00:53:55,070 --> 00:53:57,640
What? You might as well just faint.

631
00:53:59,340 --> 00:54:02,170
If I passed out, you would just leave me behind.

632
00:54:02,540 --> 00:54:04,810
I am tempted to leave you behind even if you do not.

633
00:54:05,780 --> 00:54:09,550
You will guard this place every day so Dal is never left alone here.

634
00:54:09,650 --> 00:54:11,980
- Got it? - You want me to...

635
00:54:12,280 --> 00:54:15,320
guard this place? This place that is crawling with rats? Me?

636
00:54:16,390 --> 00:54:18,220
To the rats, you are the scary one, you idiot.

637
00:54:18,490 --> 00:54:20,260
That is why they are all scurrying away from you.

638
00:54:23,030 --> 00:54:24,030
Rats?

639
00:54:25,630 --> 00:54:26,900
Rats!

640
00:54:28,500 --> 00:54:29,500
Rats.

641
00:55:14,550 --> 00:55:15,550
It was not a wall.

642
00:55:16,210 --> 00:55:17,510
It was a door all along.

643
00:55:36,770 --> 00:55:37,770
Come out.

644
00:56:44,600 --> 00:56:45,600
Who is there?

645
00:56:49,840 --> 00:56:50,840
It is the Choraengi Mask.

646
00:56:53,780 --> 00:56:55,110
Destroy this place,

647
00:56:56,110 --> 00:56:59,320
and make the Crown Prince himself release the Jimjo.

648
00:57:01,550 --> 00:57:02,620
Seize him!

649
00:57:08,860 --> 00:57:09,930
Your Royal Highness.

650
00:57:19,970 --> 00:57:21,000
It is explosive!

651
00:57:22,240 --> 00:57:23,240
Yoon Se Dol!

652
00:57:29,610 --> 00:57:30,610
Get out!

653
00:57:57,110 --> 00:57:58,580
It's the Jimjo! Go after it!

654
00:57:58,880 --> 00:57:59,880
Yes, Your Highness!

655
00:58:02,410 --> 00:58:04,450
- Go after it! - Yes, Your Highness!

656
00:58:15,390 --> 00:58:16,990
That is toward the palace.

657
00:58:17,360 --> 00:58:19,800
Its maternal instinct is strong. It must be going to its chick.

658
00:58:20,460 --> 00:58:21,570
We have to get to the palace immediately.

659
00:58:21,800 --> 00:58:24,739
Lady Park wanted to help with the Gyesa Year Incident.

660
00:58:24,740 --> 00:58:26,670
So she guards the chick every day from the Left State Councillor.

661
00:58:27,540 --> 00:58:28,540
Dal.

662
00:58:29,440 --> 00:58:30,440
Dal.

663
00:58:51,400 --> 00:58:52,630
The Jimjo's tracks...

664
00:58:53,760 --> 00:58:55,870
are all gone.

665
00:58:58,700 --> 00:59:00,070
There is no other way now.

666
00:59:01,240 --> 00:59:02,910
We must capture the Jimjo alive.

667
00:59:23,530 --> 00:59:24,530
What is that?

668
00:59:25,900 --> 00:59:26,900
What's that?

669
00:59:52,290 --> 00:59:53,860
Look! Over there! What is that?

670
00:59:54,120 --> 00:59:55,130
What is that?

671
00:59:56,130 --> 00:59:59,600
- What is all this commotion? - Your Majesty, look over there...

672
01:00:01,330 --> 01:00:04,300
My goodness, what in the world is that?

673
01:00:05,170 --> 01:00:06,200
I am not sure, Your Majesty.

674
01:00:12,040 --> 01:00:13,080
A Jimjo?

675
01:00:14,680 --> 01:00:16,780
Your Majesty, it is dangerous! Please get to safety.

676
01:00:19,680 --> 01:00:23,390
- Your Majesty. Hurry! - Yes. Get Her Majesty to safety.

677
01:00:23,650 --> 01:00:25,660
- Yes! - This way.

678
01:00:31,430 --> 01:00:32,560
Why is the Jimjo here?

679
01:00:43,070 --> 01:00:44,070
The chick?

680
01:01:16,670 --> 01:01:18,640
- Get the flaming arrows ready! - Yes, sir!

681
01:01:19,410 --> 01:01:20,580
Once I capture the Jimjo alive...

682
01:01:21,380 --> 01:01:24,110
and prove its habitat is linked to the Left State Councillor,

683
01:01:24,710 --> 01:01:26,520
he will be finished for treason.

684
01:01:26,620 --> 01:01:29,350
I have staked my life on this revenge.

685
01:01:30,990 --> 01:01:32,020
If it dies here,

686
01:01:32,320 --> 01:01:34,090
we cannot prove the Left State Councillor is behind this.

687
01:01:34,720 --> 01:01:37,190
We have to capture it alive. I cannot let that happen.

688
01:01:38,130 --> 01:01:39,130
We must capture it alive.

689
01:01:39,330 --> 01:01:42,600
Lady Park, you should not get involved. Please get to safety.

690
01:01:42,700 --> 01:01:43,870
I will take full responsibility.

691
01:01:45,140 --> 01:01:48,440
I will lure the bird. Evacuate the court ladies first.

692
01:01:48,710 --> 01:01:51,810
Then, have the Royal Guard go to the square and prepare the ropes.

693
01:01:52,010 --> 01:01:54,410
It must be captured alive.

694
01:01:54,850 --> 01:01:56,680
- Go. - Yes, my lady.

695
01:02:02,220 --> 01:02:03,950
What are you waiting for? Hurry!

696
01:02:04,050 --> 01:02:06,420
Yes, we will move to Injeongjeon Hall.

697
01:02:06,520 --> 01:02:08,590
- To the Injeongjeon Hall! - Yes, sir!

698
01:02:19,040 --> 01:02:20,970
Your Royal Highness, Lady Park...

699
01:02:25,440 --> 01:02:28,080
Dal, do not do anything.

700
01:02:28,710 --> 01:02:30,210
Please, do not do anything reckless.

701
01:02:53,770 --> 01:02:55,270
I am sorry.

702
01:02:56,710 --> 01:02:57,710
It is here!

703
01:02:58,410 --> 01:02:59,440
Your chick is right here!

704
01:03:12,190 --> 01:03:13,720
Gosh!

705
01:03:44,590 --> 01:03:46,260
Lady Park, get back!

706
01:05:05,000 --> 01:05:07,339
Take it! Do not let it escape!

707
01:05:07,340 --> 01:05:09,470
- Do not let it escape! - Yes, sir!

708
01:05:13,380 --> 01:05:14,380
Your Royal Highness.

709
01:05:20,650 --> 01:05:21,990
I am alive.

710
01:05:22,950 --> 01:05:26,460
What, you think you have nine lives? That death will just spare you?

711
01:05:27,020 --> 01:05:28,560
What in the world were you thinking?

712
01:05:32,400 --> 01:05:33,400
But I...

713
01:05:34,730 --> 01:05:35,730
I was just...

714
01:05:36,800 --> 01:05:38,540
trying to help you.

715
01:05:38,600 --> 01:05:41,040
I told you not to help! I told you repeatedly to stay out.

716
01:05:41,100 --> 01:05:42,970
Why do you keep interfering with my revenge?

717
01:05:45,810 --> 01:05:47,180
You nearly ruined everything!

718
01:05:51,210 --> 01:05:54,280
It is because I know how much this revenge means to you.

719
01:05:56,290 --> 01:05:58,690
How could I just stand by and do nothing?

720
01:06:24,350 --> 01:06:25,620
Your Royal Highness.

721
01:06:56,710 --> 01:06:57,910
Jimjo poison.

722
01:06:58,310 --> 01:07:00,180
It has a clear, odourless, tasteless oil.

723
01:07:01,080 --> 01:07:02,620
From the oil gland in its wattle.

724
01:07:37,620 --> 01:07:38,960
If it dies...

725
01:07:53,200 --> 01:07:54,340
It is all over.

726
01:07:56,710 --> 01:07:57,710
It is all over.

727
01:08:00,780 --> 01:08:01,780
Everything...

728
01:08:02,950 --> 01:08:04,350
is over.

729
01:08:07,620 --> 01:08:08,750
Because of me.

730
01:08:11,990 --> 01:08:14,160
It is all ruined because of me.

731
01:09:04,370 --> 01:09:05,380
Gang Yeon Wol.

732
01:09:06,880 --> 01:09:08,280
You are like the heavens,

733
01:09:09,350 --> 01:09:10,350
and your heart...

734
01:09:11,110 --> 01:09:12,650
I will hold it forever, with no regrets.

735
01:09:17,190 --> 01:09:18,190
You must...

736
01:09:19,520 --> 01:09:20,520
fly free...

737
01:09:23,460 --> 01:09:24,490
and rest in peace.

738
01:10:27,720 --> 01:10:28,730
Gosh.

739
01:10:29,990 --> 01:10:31,290
Why are you sleeping out here?

740
01:10:36,400 --> 01:10:37,400
No reason.

741
01:10:39,340 --> 01:10:40,370
I just could not bring myself...

742
01:10:41,200 --> 01:10:42,510
to sleep soundly.

743
01:10:44,040 --> 01:10:45,040
I am so sorry.

744
01:10:46,210 --> 01:10:47,810
I have ruined everything.

745
01:10:51,480 --> 01:10:52,850
The most important thing to you, Your Highness,

746
01:10:54,980 --> 01:10:56,490
was avenging the Crown Princess.

747
01:10:57,650 --> 01:10:59,320
And now, because of me, it is all ruined.

748
01:11:01,990 --> 01:11:02,990
What are you talking about?

749
01:11:03,830 --> 01:11:05,130
I protected what was most important.

750
01:11:05,500 --> 01:11:09,100
But the Jimjo is dead, so your revenge is ruined, is it not?

751
01:11:09,870 --> 01:11:10,870
For that revenge...

752
01:11:14,340 --> 01:11:16,140
I heard you were even willing to risk your life.

753
01:11:18,780 --> 01:11:19,980
Revenge was the only way...

754
01:11:20,980 --> 01:11:23,450
I could atone to the Crown Princess.

755
01:11:24,280 --> 01:11:26,180
Filled with so much hatred and guilt,

756
01:11:29,250 --> 01:11:30,550
I could not come to you.

757
01:11:34,390 --> 01:11:35,390
But if you had died,

758
01:11:36,890 --> 01:11:38,390
I would have had nowhere left to go.

759
01:11:44,000 --> 01:11:45,000
I just...

760
01:11:46,270 --> 01:11:47,270
I thought...

761
01:11:48,570 --> 01:11:50,610
you must be furious with me.

762
01:11:51,340 --> 01:11:54,110
So furious you would never want to see me again.

763
01:11:54,340 --> 01:11:58,580
I thought that all day, so I just...

764
01:12:00,420 --> 01:12:02,020
The fault is not yours. It is mine.

765
01:12:04,250 --> 01:12:06,090
I was angry at myself for always...

766
01:12:08,090 --> 01:12:09,560
putting you in harm's way.

767
01:12:20,940 --> 01:12:22,840
How could I ever be angry with you?

768
01:12:23,940 --> 01:12:26,380
You are the sole exception to all my anger.

769
01:12:28,510 --> 01:12:30,950
I meant to tell you after my revenge was complete.

770
01:12:33,950 --> 01:12:35,520
But you are having such foolish thoughts,

771
01:12:38,290 --> 01:12:39,890
so I have no choice but to tell you now.

772
01:12:44,290 --> 01:12:45,290
That I...

773
01:12:56,710 --> 01:12:58,170
I am very deeply...

774
01:13:01,480 --> 01:13:02,480
in love...

775
01:13:04,810 --> 01:13:05,820
with you, Park Dal.

776
01:13:16,030 --> 01:13:17,030
Me too.

777
01:15:03,830 --> 01:15:08,700
(Moon River)

778
01:15:23,890 --> 01:15:26,560
I am not going to let you go, even if you talk my ear off.

779
01:15:26,920 --> 01:15:28,560
So you hold on to me tight too.

780
01:15:29,030 --> 01:15:31,090
The Crown Prince and his Concubine are so lovey-dovey.

781
01:15:31,360 --> 01:15:35,200
The entire palace is buzzing. And if she were to conceive...

782
01:15:36,670 --> 01:15:38,230
Who do I look like to you now?

783
01:15:38,300 --> 01:15:40,170
And I... who do you see before you now?

784
01:15:40,240 --> 01:15:41,570
Because of one woman,

785
01:15:41,900 --> 01:15:44,410
five years of hard work have crumbled to dust.

786
01:15:44,540 --> 01:15:47,040
A fledgling Jimjo's toxin is weak.

787
01:15:47,310 --> 01:15:49,410
It cannot become a true Jimjo.

788
01:15:50,180 --> 01:15:53,680
It seems another sacrifice will be required.

789
01:16:11,930 --> 01:16:16,040
(Moon River)
