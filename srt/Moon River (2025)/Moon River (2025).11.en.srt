1
00:00:04,140 --> 00:00:09,049
(Moon River)

2
00:00:09,050 --> 00:00:10,380
(All people, incidents, and backgrounds...)

3
00:00:10,450 --> 00:00:11,680
(in this drama are fictitious and unrelated to reality.)

4
00:00:11,750 --> 00:00:13,790
(Also, children and animals were filmed under production guidelines.)

5
00:00:16,020 --> 00:00:18,760
This is a rare tea, a gift from my father.

6
00:00:23,690 --> 00:00:25,300
Royal Mother!

7
00:00:27,570 --> 00:00:28,670
Royal Mother!

8
00:00:28,730 --> 00:00:31,300
Is anyone out there? Summon the Royal Physician now!

9
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:32,800
Royal Mother!

10
00:00:37,010 --> 00:00:39,510
The traitor, Crown Princess Gang...

11
00:00:40,110 --> 00:00:42,710
who assassinated the Queen, is to be deposed...

12
00:00:43,550 --> 00:00:45,450
and demoted to the status of a commoner.

13
00:00:50,050 --> 00:00:51,260
So, Your Highness,

14
00:00:52,690 --> 00:00:57,500
you must not be swayed by pity or curiosity.

15
00:01:00,430 --> 00:01:02,070
What do you mean by that?

16
00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:06,270
You have a long and an arduous road ahead.

17
00:01:07,310 --> 00:01:08,710
Take care on your journey.

18
00:01:28,990 --> 00:01:30,130
Why are you here?

19
00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:31,930
Because I missed you.

20
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:35,430
I no longer wish to see you, Your Royal Highness.

21
00:01:36,130 --> 00:01:39,340
I despise the royals that killed mine, the palace,

22
00:01:39,770 --> 00:01:42,270
and you, Your Royal Highness, who will become its master.

23
00:01:43,470 --> 00:01:44,510
So,

24
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:46,680
never come here again.

25
00:01:57,460 --> 00:01:58,620
Do you really mean that?

26
00:02:04,930 --> 00:02:06,000
I do.

27
00:02:08,230 --> 00:02:09,500
Then I will give it all up.

28
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:14,510
Yes.

29
00:02:15,910 --> 00:02:17,440
That is a wise decision.

30
00:02:19,810 --> 00:02:21,480
This worthless title of Crown Prince...

31
00:02:22,310 --> 00:02:25,220
I have no desire or ambition for it whatsoever.

32
00:02:27,550 --> 00:02:29,590
If there is one thing I have ever truly desired,

33
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:33,760
it is you and you alone.

34
00:02:35,830 --> 00:02:36,930
So please,

35
00:02:38,530 --> 00:02:40,500
you must remain my heart's one desire.

36
00:02:43,100 --> 00:02:44,100
Please...

37
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:49,010
do not abandon me.

38
00:02:50,510 --> 00:02:51,510
Yeon Wol.

39
00:02:56,980 --> 00:02:58,050
Please leave.

40
00:02:59,950 --> 00:03:00,950
No!

41
00:03:01,750 --> 00:03:05,190
I will come back, and I will follow you anywhere.

42
00:03:06,460 --> 00:03:07,590
We will, no matter what,

43
00:03:08,730 --> 00:03:10,530
be together!

44
00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:21,870
I am told you are looking after the Crown Princess.

45
00:03:22,270 --> 00:03:23,309
Yes, Your Majesty.

46
00:03:23,310 --> 00:03:25,980
She is a traitor who killed the Queen.

47
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:28,350
By taking care of a criminal like her,

48
00:03:29,050 --> 00:03:31,480
you could lose your life as well. Do you know that?

49
00:03:31,980 --> 00:03:33,220
I do not care.

50
00:03:34,190 --> 00:03:35,690
I made a promise to protect Her Highness...

51
00:03:36,250 --> 00:03:38,420
to her older brother.

52
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,030
In two days,

53
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:48,570
the Crown Princess will be...

54
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:53,140
sentenced to death by poison in the late afternoon by my command.

55
00:03:55,070 --> 00:03:57,140
Why are you telling me this?

56
00:04:02,580 --> 00:04:04,580
Deliver this letter to the Crown Princess.

57
00:04:25,700 --> 00:04:26,870
Yes, Your Majesty.

58
00:04:27,910 --> 00:04:30,680
This is a letter from His Majesty.

59
00:04:40,380 --> 00:04:42,450
A Crown Prince has but two paths in life.

60
00:04:43,390 --> 00:04:46,060
To ascend the throne, or to die.

61
00:04:47,020 --> 00:04:50,130
The Crown Prince plans to abandon everything to run away with you.

62
00:04:50,760 --> 00:04:52,930
So, for the Prince's sake, you must let the world believe you are dead.

63
00:04:54,100 --> 00:04:57,740
Go far away, and live the rest of your life as if you were dead.

64
00:05:01,270 --> 00:05:03,110
His Majesty will sentence you to death by poison.

65
00:05:03,770 --> 00:05:05,580
You must flee at once, Your Highness.

66
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:07,980
Why would I run away?

67
00:05:09,010 --> 00:05:10,350
I am innocent.

68
00:05:11,950 --> 00:05:15,720
If I run, it will be an admission that I killed the Royal Mother.

69
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:17,120
But...

70
00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:19,020
I did not.

71
00:05:20,390 --> 00:05:21,390
I know.

72
00:05:21,890 --> 00:05:25,600
But who is going to believe you now?

73
00:05:30,230 --> 00:05:31,670
If I run away,

74
00:05:34,910 --> 00:05:38,180
His Royal Highness will stop at nothing to find me.

75
00:05:41,850 --> 00:05:44,750
A Crown Prince looking for the wife who assassinated his own mother.

76
00:05:47,990 --> 00:05:49,720
How could he possibly survive?

77
00:05:53,220 --> 00:05:54,230
Your Highness.

78
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:58,460
For now, just think about yourself.

79
00:06:08,970 --> 00:06:10,010
Fine.

80
00:06:11,110 --> 00:06:12,340
I will think only of myself.

81
00:06:13,980 --> 00:06:16,550
Can you arrange where I will go...

82
00:06:17,780 --> 00:06:19,080
and how I will get there?

83
00:06:19,820 --> 00:06:20,820
Yes, Your Highness.

84
00:06:50,750 --> 00:06:54,820
As long as His Royal Highness is safe, I can be at peace.

85
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,430
Who are you?

86
00:07:09,700 --> 00:07:10,899
You fell into the water,

87
00:07:10,900 --> 00:07:12,670
and it seems you have lost your memory.

88
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:14,910
Your name is Park Dal,

89
00:07:15,970 --> 00:07:17,210
and I am your aunt.

90
00:07:19,110 --> 00:07:20,110
Park...

91
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:22,480
Dal...

92
00:07:24,250 --> 00:07:25,250
That is me.

93
00:07:29,350 --> 00:07:30,890
Hong Nan...

94
00:07:35,490 --> 00:07:37,060
Why did you deceive me?

95
00:07:38,830 --> 00:07:40,130
Why would you do that?

96
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:44,500
Wait.

97
00:07:46,170 --> 00:07:47,870
Go get my brother and his wife.

98
00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:49,970
Hurry! Go get them!

99
00:07:50,770 --> 00:07:51,780
Okay.

100
00:08:15,930 --> 00:08:17,000
Have your memories...

101
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:20,670
returned?

102
00:08:23,510 --> 00:08:24,780
In bits and pieces...

103
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:27,980
Just fragments.

104
00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:31,720
So does that mean...

105
00:08:32,820 --> 00:08:36,020
I am really Gang Yeon Wol?

106
00:08:36,650 --> 00:08:37,660
Yes.

107
00:08:40,790 --> 00:08:42,130
I know you are confused,

108
00:08:42,230 --> 00:08:44,160
but you must accept it, Your Highness.

109
00:08:45,130 --> 00:08:47,200
It is not about whether I accept it or not.

110
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:51,940
In the memories of Park Dal that you told me about five years ago,

111
00:08:53,070 --> 00:08:55,470
I do not recognise a single face,

112
00:08:56,870 --> 00:09:01,580
But the faces in the memories flooding back to me are so vivid.

113
00:09:02,510 --> 00:09:04,750
I know that these are my real memories,

114
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:07,120
and that I...

115
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:09,690
am Gang Yeon Wol.

116
00:09:10,790 --> 00:09:12,590
My head gets that,

117
00:09:14,090 --> 00:09:16,359
but those are just memories.

118
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:18,600
I have been Park Dal my whole life.

119
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:21,800
I am so confused. I cannot tell what is real anymore.

120
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:28,310
Your Highness, of course you are confused.

121
00:09:29,010 --> 00:09:30,470
But we are out of time.

122
00:09:31,640 --> 00:09:33,110
You have to run.

123
00:09:35,410 --> 00:09:36,510
Run? What do you mean?

124
00:09:36,750 --> 00:09:40,950
His Majesty plans to have you declared dead again.

125
00:09:43,650 --> 00:09:45,190
Declared dead?

126
00:09:45,820 --> 00:09:47,260
He is going to set fire to the royal quarters...

127
00:09:48,090 --> 00:09:51,600
and prepare a similar body to be found inside.

128
00:09:52,260 --> 00:09:55,170
You will be officially recorded...

129
00:09:55,530 --> 00:09:56,830
as having died in the blaze.

130
00:09:58,970 --> 00:10:00,300
As if drowning was not enough,

131
00:10:01,170 --> 00:10:03,640
now you expect me to live my life afraid of fire too?

132
00:10:04,340 --> 00:10:05,879
And I am supposed to live like that...

133
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:07,480
after shattering His Highness' heart again?

134
00:10:08,010 --> 00:10:10,580
No, I cannot do that! I have to go to the palace!

135
00:10:10,650 --> 00:10:12,920
You cannot! Brother, stop her!

136
00:10:15,950 --> 00:10:19,220
Why are you all doing this?

137
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:22,990
Your Highness, please. Just give up.

138
00:10:23,530 --> 00:10:24,600
You have to leave.

139
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:28,000
I know it is hard now, but this will all pass.

140
00:10:28,430 --> 00:10:31,440
Time will keep moving, and it heals all wounds.

141
00:10:33,270 --> 00:10:35,940
Brother, take Her Highness.

142
00:10:48,420 --> 00:10:49,420
Stop crying.

143
00:10:49,750 --> 00:10:52,490
They said you will die if you go back now.

144
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:57,430
If I just leave like this,

145
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:01,370
what about His Royal Highness?

146
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:04,900
For the last five years,

147
00:11:05,640 --> 00:11:07,670
I have made him live in a nightmare.

148
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:13,740
And you want me to put him back in that nightmare again?

149
00:11:14,210 --> 00:11:16,110
I cannot do that.

150
00:11:16,280 --> 00:11:18,250
I just cannot.

151
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:22,490
- I just cannot do it. - Goodness.

152
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:27,290
Does it pain you that much?

153
00:11:30,030 --> 00:11:31,060
Goodness.

154
00:11:31,830 --> 00:11:35,630
You cannot just turn off feelings for someone.

155
00:11:36,670 --> 00:11:37,770
Time heals all wounds.

156
00:11:38,540 --> 00:11:40,100
But that is only if you let time pass.

157
00:11:42,940 --> 00:11:47,280
How can you heal if you keep reliving that day?

158
00:11:52,580 --> 00:11:53,580
Your Highness.

159
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:10,030
- What do you think you are doing? - I am sorry, Hong Nan.

160
00:12:10,670 --> 00:12:12,070
Go on, Dal!

161
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,569
Today is the day for lovers.

162
00:12:14,570 --> 00:12:17,340
We will be your bridge to him.

163
00:12:17,410 --> 00:12:20,010
What are you waiting for? The bridge will be gone!

164
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:21,980
- Go on, hurry! - Go!

165
00:12:22,050 --> 00:12:23,180
No!

166
00:12:24,310 --> 00:12:25,850
- Your Highness! - Go on!

167
00:12:25,950 --> 00:12:27,250
- Let me go! - Go.

168
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:29,750
I am a crow! Go!

169
00:12:30,590 --> 00:12:31,660
- Your Highness! - Go on!

170
00:12:32,090 --> 00:12:35,490
- Go! - Your Highness!

171
00:12:36,090 --> 00:12:38,700
- Dal! - Go on!

172
00:12:45,270 --> 00:12:46,270
Your Highness!

173
00:12:53,480 --> 00:12:54,480
Your Highness!

174
00:13:21,770 --> 00:13:24,240
Do you two have any idea what you have just done?

175
00:13:24,940 --> 00:13:28,480
Your emotions got the better of you and sent Dal to her death!

176
00:13:28,580 --> 00:13:30,349
She would rather die. We had no choice.

177
00:13:30,350 --> 00:13:32,120
If she feels that way, she must go.

178
00:13:32,580 --> 00:13:34,380
How can you act so detached?

179
00:13:34,920 --> 00:13:36,350
I know you are not her birth parents,

180
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:40,260
- but you raised her for five years! - But, Hong Nan!

181
00:13:40,860 --> 00:13:42,260
It is her life, is it not?

182
00:13:43,330 --> 00:13:46,230
A parent can die for their child,

183
00:13:46,430 --> 00:13:48,730
but they cannot live their child's life for them.

184
00:13:49,100 --> 00:13:50,100
That is right.

185
00:13:50,770 --> 00:13:53,670
You are still hung up on a promise you made to your lost love.

186
00:13:54,100 --> 00:13:57,110
Imagine Dal leaving a living love.

187
00:13:57,270 --> 00:13:59,480
- Brother. - We know from experience.

188
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:03,310
- Some loves are worth dying for. - Exactly.

189
00:14:03,450 --> 00:14:04,620
What can we do? They are so in love.

190
00:14:05,020 --> 00:14:06,350
It makes them blind to everything else.

191
00:14:13,390 --> 00:14:14,390
What a fool.

192
00:14:15,160 --> 00:14:16,160
Me?

193
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:18,100
Not you.

194
00:14:19,830 --> 00:14:21,130
That foolish girl.

195
00:14:22,470 --> 00:14:23,830
Why did she have to leave?

196
00:14:24,470 --> 00:14:25,670
Why did she have to die?

197
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:28,240
She must have been so lost...

198
00:14:29,470 --> 00:14:31,210
and then some.

199
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:33,780
Who are you talking about?

200
00:14:39,580 --> 00:14:40,650
Gang Yeon Wol.

201
00:14:45,460 --> 00:14:46,460
Right.

202
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:49,360
I am done overthinking it.

203
00:14:49,860 --> 00:14:52,460
His Royal Highness is fighting a war every single day.

204
00:14:53,630 --> 00:14:57,300
He must be torn apart over that secret pact.

205
00:14:58,300 --> 00:15:01,240
I cannot just sit here in a daze because some memories are back.

206
00:15:01,740 --> 00:15:06,010
Your Highness. I do not understand a single word you are saying.

207
00:15:06,210 --> 00:15:08,350
You do not have to. It is all nonsense anyway.

208
00:15:10,610 --> 00:15:13,619
First, I must go to the throne hall.

209
00:15:13,620 --> 00:15:15,020
Wait. Your Highness.

210
00:15:15,290 --> 00:15:20,020
You cannot just go see His Majesty whenever you please.

211
00:15:20,260 --> 00:15:23,290
- You must be summoned first... - He is going to summon me anyway.

212
00:15:23,860 --> 00:15:28,100
This just saves us some time. From now on, it is an emergency.

213
00:15:28,970 --> 00:15:29,970
Wait...

214
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:31,640
All right.

215
00:15:32,970 --> 00:15:35,110
As a matter of fact, I was about to send for you.

216
00:15:36,040 --> 00:15:37,840
What were you thinking coming back here?

217
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:40,940
Did they not tell you who you are?

218
00:15:41,450 --> 00:15:42,450
They told me.

219
00:15:44,080 --> 00:15:47,280
- Most of my memory has returned. - Then you should have run away.

220
00:15:48,290 --> 00:15:51,590
- Why would you come back? - Why would I run away?

221
00:15:51,960 --> 00:15:54,260
The Left State Councillor will stop at nothing to kill you.

222
00:15:54,390 --> 00:15:56,230
Yes, you are right, Your Majesty.

223
00:15:56,560 --> 00:15:59,760
The Left State Councillor wants me dead regardless of my title.

224
00:16:00,630 --> 00:16:03,370
He is desperate enough to bring a false witness before the King,

225
00:16:03,770 --> 00:16:06,140
and his men are all over the country.

226
00:16:06,940 --> 00:16:08,640
If he is already set on killing me,

227
00:16:09,170 --> 00:16:11,610
would it not be easier for him to do it outside the palace?

228
00:16:14,140 --> 00:16:15,150
But...

229
00:16:16,080 --> 00:16:18,580
it is only a matter of time before he learns who you really are.

230
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:21,119
Exactly. Running away now...

231
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:22,720
is admitting I am the Crown Princess.

232
00:16:22,950 --> 00:16:24,490
Why would I give him that kind of leverage?

233
00:16:24,820 --> 00:16:26,620
After that humiliation at the interrogation ground,

234
00:16:26,860 --> 00:16:28,830
he cannot use a witness to prove who I am anymore.

235
00:16:29,690 --> 00:16:31,830
He needs hard evidence to prove that I am the Crown Princess,

236
00:16:32,230 --> 00:16:33,400
and where would he ever find that?

237
00:16:35,830 --> 00:16:36,900
The Left State Councillor...

238
00:16:39,100 --> 00:16:40,270
is a terrifying man.

239
00:16:41,510 --> 00:16:43,370
He will stop at nothing to kill you.

240
00:16:44,070 --> 00:16:45,310
Then the Crown Prince...

241
00:16:45,840 --> 00:16:48,610
will risk his life to protect you,

242
00:16:49,650 --> 00:16:51,920
and I still remain incompetent and powerless as ever,

243
00:16:53,020 --> 00:16:55,250
unable to protect either of you.

244
00:16:57,290 --> 00:16:59,390
Nothing has changed since five years ago.

245
00:17:02,330 --> 00:17:03,590
Nothing has changed at all.

246
00:17:04,860 --> 00:17:05,860
No.

247
00:17:12,900 --> 00:17:14,000
I have changed.

248
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:18,880
I am not the same Yeon Wol who quietly vanished five years ago.

249
00:17:20,340 --> 00:17:21,850
Whether I have my memories back or not,

250
00:17:22,750 --> 00:17:25,820
I am going to stay right by His Royal Highness's side...

251
00:17:27,420 --> 00:17:29,450
and spend the rest of my life with him.

252
00:17:30,750 --> 00:17:31,790
I am Park Dal now.

253
00:17:37,290 --> 00:17:40,100
I am not leaving...

254
00:17:41,630 --> 00:17:42,930
His Highness' side, ever.

255
00:17:46,740 --> 00:17:48,740
As much as I care for His Royal Highness...

256
00:17:49,640 --> 00:17:51,880
No, even more than that.

257
00:17:53,480 --> 00:17:56,880
I know you want to protect him too, Your Majesty.

258
00:17:58,320 --> 00:18:02,650
Do not let fear make you think only of His Highness' physical safety.

259
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:06,890
For once...

260
00:18:09,090 --> 00:18:10,290
Just this once,

261
00:18:11,190 --> 00:18:13,200
please think about how His Highness feels.

262
00:18:16,670 --> 00:18:17,670
Please?

263
00:18:23,610 --> 00:18:25,110
For the past five years,

264
00:18:26,110 --> 00:18:27,939
His Highness has been tormented by guilt,

265
00:18:27,940 --> 00:18:29,350
living every single day in his own personal nightmare.

266
00:18:30,980 --> 00:18:33,120
His Highness has only just started to breathe again.

267
00:18:35,090 --> 00:18:37,450
Will you send him back to despair to drown all over again,

268
00:18:38,760 --> 00:18:39,860
Royal Father?

269
00:18:47,300 --> 00:18:50,730
(Chapter 11: There Is No Paradise in Running Away)

270
00:19:00,280 --> 00:19:02,280
Ever since he was captured at Jemulpo,

271
00:19:02,850 --> 00:19:04,410
he has done nothing but drink.

272
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:06,620
Are you just going to keep this up?

273
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:09,090
I do not know...

274
00:19:10,150 --> 00:19:11,290
how else to be.

275
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:13,920
Snap out of it!

276
00:19:14,390 --> 00:19:15,390
Give it here.

277
00:19:17,290 --> 00:19:19,330
No. You are already drunk.

278
00:19:20,630 --> 00:19:23,930
What good would sobering up do me?

279
00:19:28,870 --> 00:19:31,880
U Hui is confined to the Detached Palace, is she not?

280
00:19:34,340 --> 00:19:36,950
By rule, a royal consort is to remain in the Detached Palace.

281
00:19:37,310 --> 00:19:38,320
That is right.

282
00:19:38,750 --> 00:19:42,450
The palace has always been one giant prison, after all.

283
00:19:44,090 --> 00:19:45,820
I told our Royal Father to abdicate the throne.

284
00:19:47,620 --> 00:19:48,630
Abdicate?

285
00:19:48,860 --> 00:19:50,789
The Left State Councillor's only hold on Father...

286
00:19:50,790 --> 00:19:52,130
is because of the secret pact.

287
00:19:52,860 --> 00:19:54,600
If he admits the coup had no just cause...

288
00:19:54,830 --> 00:19:56,130
and abdicates the throne to you,

289
00:19:56,670 --> 00:19:58,299
you, as the Late King's true heir,

290
00:19:58,300 --> 00:19:59,940
will have the authority to punish the Left State Councillor.

291
00:20:02,210 --> 00:20:03,210
You want me...

292
00:20:04,310 --> 00:20:05,710
to sit on the throne?

293
00:20:07,340 --> 00:20:09,679
The bloody throne that killed my mother...

294
00:20:09,680 --> 00:20:11,620
and got me exiled?

295
00:20:12,780 --> 00:20:13,780
And then what?

296
00:20:16,590 --> 00:20:18,220
Who would I have left by my side?

297
00:20:20,260 --> 00:20:22,430
After casting you and His Majesty out,

298
00:20:22,790 --> 00:20:26,130
and stand by and watch U Hui, branded a traitor's daughter,

299
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:30,330
why should I have to live on, sitting on that agonizing throne?

300
00:20:31,230 --> 00:20:32,240
If that is the price,

301
00:20:33,300 --> 00:20:34,970
I would rather not have revenge at all.

302
00:20:36,140 --> 00:20:37,140
Un.

303
00:20:38,710 --> 00:20:41,510
Look at this mess the Left State Councillor has caused.

304
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:45,480
If it were not for him, everyone would be happy.

305
00:20:46,520 --> 00:20:47,520
The Left State Councillor...

306
00:20:48,890 --> 00:20:50,620
Can we not just kill him?

307
00:20:50,950 --> 00:20:52,960
If it were that easy, I would have done it long ago.

308
00:20:54,390 --> 00:20:56,260
The Left State Councillor is surrounded by his personal guards,

309
00:20:56,660 --> 00:20:59,860
and in the palace, the Royal Guard protects him, not my Royal Father.

310
00:21:00,230 --> 00:21:02,170
And his own martial arts skill is formidable.

311
00:21:02,600 --> 00:21:06,100
Honestly, he is a legend among the military cadets.

312
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,010
Exactly.

313
00:21:09,510 --> 00:21:11,410
Things would be so simple if he were just gone.

314
00:21:12,740 --> 00:21:13,780
Just wait.

315
00:21:14,810 --> 00:21:16,710
If you despise the thought of taking the throne that much,

316
00:21:17,910 --> 00:21:20,950
- I will find another way. - Is there another way?

317
00:21:22,650 --> 00:21:23,650
Gang,

318
00:21:24,690 --> 00:21:27,690
do not do anything. Just...

319
00:21:28,930 --> 00:21:30,130
stay out of it.

320
00:21:43,470 --> 00:21:44,610
Your Highness.

321
00:21:46,580 --> 00:21:47,580
I am fine.

322
00:21:48,140 --> 00:21:51,080
You are not fine. You have been acting odd all day.

323
00:21:51,850 --> 00:21:53,050
Maybe you have heatstroke?

324
00:21:57,250 --> 00:21:58,250
I guess so.

325
00:21:59,490 --> 00:22:00,860
It has not rained,

326
00:22:01,890 --> 00:22:03,190
and the sun is so strong.

327
00:22:04,090 --> 00:22:05,160
I must have heatstroke.

328
00:22:06,160 --> 00:22:07,160
This will not do.

329
00:22:08,830 --> 00:22:09,970
Please sit and rest for a bit.

330
00:22:11,870 --> 00:22:15,109
Your Highness, I will get you some cool water.

331
00:22:15,110 --> 00:22:16,410
Please just sit here for a moment.

332
00:23:31,710 --> 00:23:33,180
I have missed you, my love.

333
00:23:36,850 --> 00:23:38,390
Your Highness, here is your water.

334
00:23:41,660 --> 00:23:42,660
Yeon Sim.

335
00:23:43,130 --> 00:23:44,130
Yes?

336
00:23:45,130 --> 00:23:46,160
Today,

337
00:23:47,330 --> 00:23:51,330
my mind has been a total mess,

338
00:23:52,770 --> 00:23:54,340
and I could not make sense of anything.

339
00:23:54,900 --> 00:23:57,270
I know. That is why you should drink this.

340
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:01,880
But...

341
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:05,350
there is one thing I know for sure now.

342
00:24:07,320 --> 00:24:09,120
I have to see His Royal Highness right now.

343
00:24:09,990 --> 00:24:11,390
Oh, gosh! Wait!

344
00:24:33,410 --> 00:24:36,110
Dal. What are you doing here?

345
00:24:41,150 --> 00:24:42,150
No!

346
00:24:42,950 --> 00:24:46,060
I will come back, and I will follow you anywhere.

347
00:24:47,260 --> 00:24:48,320
We will, no matter what,

348
00:24:49,660 --> 00:24:51,330
be together!

349
00:25:15,950 --> 00:25:17,190
I am here so we can be together.

350
00:25:38,610 --> 00:25:42,510
Please do not tell His Highness that my memory has returned.

351
00:25:44,150 --> 00:25:45,750
He is already going through so much as it is.

352
00:25:46,580 --> 00:25:48,580
I do not want to give him more reason to worry.

353
00:25:50,150 --> 00:25:51,490
And I know I have no right to ask,

354
00:25:52,760 --> 00:25:54,660
but please look after my family.

355
00:26:04,830 --> 00:26:05,900
Head Eunuch Park.

356
00:26:11,370 --> 00:26:14,740
Disguise reliable Royal Guards as servants at Unjeong Palace...

357
00:26:15,580 --> 00:26:17,450
and have them protect the Crown Princess's family.

358
00:26:19,180 --> 00:26:22,850
The Left State Councillor must not get his hands on her family.

359
00:26:23,250 --> 00:26:26,160
Then will you keep the Crown Princess in the palace?

360
00:26:26,790 --> 00:26:28,990
If I fail to protect her again,

361
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:32,830
my son, Gang, will be broken.

362
00:26:38,200 --> 00:26:40,800
The kids have changed in the past five years,

363
00:26:42,810 --> 00:26:44,410
so I must change as well as the adult.

364
00:26:55,850 --> 00:26:56,890
His Majesty...

365
00:26:57,950 --> 00:27:00,490
sent the Royal Guards to Unjeong Palace?

366
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:04,160
Yes. The Royal Concubine's family is staying at Unjeong Palace,

367
00:27:04,460 --> 00:27:05,900
and Hong Nan, a gisaeng from Eunwol Pavilion,

368
00:27:06,900 --> 00:27:08,200
is said to be the Royal Concubine's aunt.

369
00:27:09,170 --> 00:27:10,800
I did not report it as I was unsure,

370
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:14,170
but her neighbours said something odd before they died.

371
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:16,169
They said the Royal Concubine suddenly appeared in Boryeong...

372
00:27:16,170 --> 00:27:17,640
in winter five years ago,

373
00:27:17,870 --> 00:27:19,740
and that she is not, in fact, Lord Heo's wife's niece.

374
00:27:20,940 --> 00:27:21,940
They claim it is all true.

375
00:27:22,580 --> 00:27:24,450
Why are you only telling me this now?

376
00:27:24,650 --> 00:27:26,780
At the time, I thought they lied to save their own skin.

377
00:27:27,450 --> 00:27:28,480
I deserve death.

378
00:27:29,750 --> 00:27:31,950
Round up the Royal Concubine's family and bring them to me.

379
00:27:32,320 --> 00:27:34,019
Forgive me, sir, but Unjeong Palace...

380
00:27:34,020 --> 00:27:35,060
was His Majesty's private residence.

381
00:27:35,190 --> 00:27:36,760
We cannot enter without authorization.

382
00:27:42,570 --> 00:27:43,600
I will find a way.

383
00:27:49,670 --> 00:27:51,140
It seems His Majesty...

384
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:56,610
still lets his personal feelings get in the way.

385
00:28:00,980 --> 00:28:03,320
All right, time for bed.

386
00:28:17,470 --> 00:28:19,740
What are you doing?

387
00:28:20,370 --> 00:28:23,340
What is it? Can I not look at my own husband?

388
00:28:23,410 --> 00:28:24,410
Is there a problem with that?

389
00:28:25,110 --> 00:28:27,440
No, I mean, I like it,

390
00:28:29,150 --> 00:28:30,980
but you are making me shy.

391
00:28:31,510 --> 00:28:32,920
It is just a little embarrassing, that is all.

392
00:28:33,320 --> 00:28:34,320
It is making me blush.

393
00:28:49,870 --> 00:28:52,340
Even if you are shy, bear with me. I am making up for lost time.

394
00:28:52,840 --> 00:28:53,840
Making up for what?

395
00:28:56,040 --> 00:28:57,040
Wait...

396
00:28:58,980 --> 00:29:00,040
From now on,

397
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:01,640
I am...

398
00:29:02,180 --> 00:29:03,580
going to stick to you like glue, Your Highness.

399
00:29:04,650 --> 00:29:06,350
I am never letting you go.

400
00:29:13,660 --> 00:29:17,030
Is this a signal for tonight?

401
00:29:18,560 --> 00:29:19,560
Maybe tonight...

402
00:29:21,930 --> 00:29:23,870
Stuck like glue...

403
00:29:30,470 --> 00:29:31,540
You little fox.

404
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:33,540
You can just fall asleep after all that?

405
00:29:35,480 --> 00:29:37,050
I am not a fox...

406
00:29:38,310 --> 00:29:39,350
Then who are you?

407
00:29:40,150 --> 00:29:41,180
What does it matter...

408
00:29:42,920 --> 00:29:43,920
what I am?

409
00:29:44,790 --> 00:29:47,320
I am just stuck on you.

410
00:29:49,760 --> 00:29:51,760
Stuck on you...

411
00:30:57,990 --> 00:30:59,200
Household Man.

412
00:31:02,160 --> 00:31:03,370
Household Man!

413
00:31:13,740 --> 00:31:15,950
Oh, my, has it gotten so late?

414
00:31:33,500 --> 00:31:34,660
Household Man!

415
00:33:01,980 --> 00:33:03,620
The wind is blowing.

416
00:33:05,590 --> 00:33:07,490
I suppose it has been for a while.

417
00:33:08,990 --> 00:33:10,660
The wind always blows.

418
00:33:12,760 --> 00:33:13,800
That is nothing new.

419
00:33:17,100 --> 00:33:18,130
I suppose you are right.

420
00:33:19,070 --> 00:33:21,140
And yet, even the wind that always blows,

421
00:33:22,140 --> 00:33:23,610
the very air I breathe...

422
00:33:24,440 --> 00:33:26,540
It all feels different to me now.

423
00:33:27,410 --> 00:33:30,610
I cannot remember the last time I could breathe so easily.

424
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:23,929
Your Highness, what shall I do about the former Chief Royal Secretary...

425
00:34:23,930 --> 00:34:26,170
and the former Chief Court Lady's niece?

426
00:34:26,970 --> 00:34:29,910
Oh, right. With everything going on, I had completely forgotten.

427
00:34:30,410 --> 00:34:32,879
First, exile the former Chief Royal Secretary, and...

428
00:34:32,880 --> 00:34:33,910
Your Royal Highness!

429
00:34:36,210 --> 00:34:37,980
- Goodness. - Gosh.

430
00:34:38,610 --> 00:34:39,650
Dal.

431
00:34:40,250 --> 00:34:41,420
What are you doing here?

432
00:34:41,820 --> 00:34:44,550
I was waiting for you to catch you on your way, Your Highness.

433
00:34:45,350 --> 00:34:47,590
You did not have to. I would have come to you.

434
00:34:48,420 --> 00:34:49,690
You startled me.

435
00:34:51,060 --> 00:34:52,830
I know you are busy with your official duties.

436
00:34:53,260 --> 00:34:57,000
Rather than sit in my room, I wanted to steal a moment with you.

437
00:34:57,200 --> 00:34:58,630
What has gotten into you since yesterday?

438
00:34:59,270 --> 00:35:02,440
Not that I am complaining, of course. Have you eaten?

439
00:35:02,840 --> 00:35:05,410
- Not yet. - Should we go get a bite to eat?

440
00:35:06,210 --> 00:35:07,210
Your Highness.

441
00:35:07,740 --> 00:35:09,649
You were giving your orders on the former Chief Royal Secretary...

442
00:35:09,650 --> 00:35:11,080
and the former Chief Court Lady's niece.

443
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:13,650
- Please continue. - Right.

444
00:35:13,980 --> 00:35:15,889
Exile the former Chief Royal Secretary,

445
00:35:15,890 --> 00:35:17,890
and make Jo Mi Geum, the sinner, a slave on the island.

446
00:35:18,350 --> 00:35:21,760
- Have the Guards tighten security. - Yes, Your Highness.

447
00:35:22,060 --> 00:35:23,060
Your Royal Highness.

448
00:35:24,160 --> 00:35:27,100
If they are sent to separate places of exile,

449
00:35:27,930 --> 00:35:29,370
does that mean they will never see each other again?

450
00:35:29,930 --> 00:35:32,400
I would assume so, yes.

451
00:35:37,840 --> 00:35:40,980
Your Royal Highness, could you do just one thing for me?

452
00:35:41,580 --> 00:35:42,580
One thing?

453
00:35:50,120 --> 00:35:51,390
Mi Geum.

454
00:35:51,750 --> 00:35:52,820
Mi Geum.

455
00:35:55,320 --> 00:35:56,490
Why did you do that?

456
00:35:57,160 --> 00:35:58,730
You should have just turned me in.

457
00:35:59,900 --> 00:36:02,530
I would rather die than let you die.

458
00:36:03,630 --> 00:36:06,400
Then how am I supposed to live? Mi Geum.

459
00:36:09,340 --> 00:36:10,710
Mi Geum...

460
00:36:11,940 --> 00:36:14,710
- Goodness. Now that is true love. - Mi Geum...

461
00:36:17,410 --> 00:36:18,450
Hey, are you crying?

462
00:36:20,920 --> 00:36:22,350
That is not true love.

463
00:36:25,390 --> 00:36:29,930
What love traps the one left behind in a living nightmare forever?

464
00:36:34,300 --> 00:36:35,300
That is why...

465
00:36:36,870 --> 00:36:38,430
I will never, ever die.

466
00:36:40,900 --> 00:36:42,370
I will not go down without a fight.

467
00:36:44,470 --> 00:36:45,470
Never.

468
00:37:01,060 --> 00:37:03,260
You are right. Let us live.

469
00:37:06,300 --> 00:37:07,560
Let us both live a long life.

470
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:16,510
My lord, it is your household man.

471
00:37:17,140 --> 00:37:18,510
Come in.

472
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:23,480
My goodness, what is all this?

473
00:37:24,810 --> 00:37:26,280
Can you not tell just by looking?

474
00:37:27,250 --> 00:37:28,350
They are pinwheels.

475
00:37:31,490 --> 00:37:33,889
No, I mean, why use this expensive coloured paper...

476
00:37:33,890 --> 00:37:36,790
to make so many useless pinwheels?

477
00:37:36,930 --> 00:37:39,430
"Useless," you say?

478
00:37:41,360 --> 00:37:42,360
Do you know...

479
00:37:43,070 --> 00:37:46,040
what I heard more than anything when I was at the palace?

480
00:37:48,770 --> 00:37:50,410
"The child who will be the death of his father."

481
00:37:50,810 --> 00:37:51,940
"The child of the prophecy."

482
00:37:53,980 --> 00:37:56,180
If the Royal Mother were to give birth to a son,

483
00:37:56,480 --> 00:37:58,350
the Royal Father would die.

484
00:37:58,850 --> 00:38:00,880
The Royal Family would fall.

485
00:38:01,920 --> 00:38:03,620
Well, that was the prophecy.

486
00:38:05,590 --> 00:38:06,590
In the end,

487
00:38:06,920 --> 00:38:08,290
it came true, just as it was foretold.

488
00:38:10,760 --> 00:38:12,130
So that means...

489
00:38:12,700 --> 00:38:15,300
I was someone who should have never been born in the first place.

490
00:38:16,330 --> 00:38:17,430
Just like these pinwheels,

491
00:38:18,700 --> 00:38:20,440
I was useless.

492
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:22,670
Do not say such ridiculous things.

493
00:38:23,270 --> 00:38:24,910
And just have this to sober up and get some sleep.

494
00:38:25,240 --> 00:38:28,040
You are still drunk. That is why you are having ridiculous thoughts.

495
00:38:30,750 --> 00:38:32,610
That is what I like about you.

496
00:38:33,620 --> 00:38:34,620
Yes, my lord.

497
00:38:34,920 --> 00:38:36,849
I like you too, my lord, so drink up.

498
00:38:36,850 --> 00:38:38,650
Drink this, and live a long life.

499
00:38:47,730 --> 00:38:51,130
Your Highness. Please just have one bite.

500
00:38:51,870 --> 00:38:53,840
Are you really trying to starve yourself to death?

501
00:38:54,100 --> 00:38:55,140
Do not worry.

502
00:38:55,670 --> 00:38:57,570
I have no intention of pathetically starving myself to death.

503
00:38:57,710 --> 00:38:59,580
Then why did you stop eating?

504
00:38:59,880 --> 00:39:01,580
Because dying from indigestion is absurd.

505
00:39:03,350 --> 00:39:05,580
How can you be joking right now?

506
00:39:06,120 --> 00:39:07,680
If I were to speak seriously,

507
00:39:08,980 --> 00:39:12,190
- you would probably end up crying. - Why do you say such scary things?

508
00:39:16,530 --> 00:39:18,290
There has been no word from Deok Chun, has there?

509
00:39:18,790 --> 00:39:19,800
No, Your Highness.

510
00:39:20,560 --> 00:39:23,030
He said he was leaving the capital, remember?

511
00:39:25,800 --> 00:39:27,440
But I need to see Deok Chun.

512
00:39:29,370 --> 00:39:30,370
What?

513
00:39:31,910 --> 00:39:33,110
What is going on outside?

514
00:39:35,910 --> 00:39:37,050
Oh, my.

515
00:39:37,410 --> 00:39:39,720
What? What is all that?

516
00:39:54,630 --> 00:39:58,970
I mean, what kind of madman would put these pinwheels at the palace?

517
00:40:00,900 --> 00:40:02,400
- Oh, my. - What is all this?

518
00:40:09,910 --> 00:40:10,910
Your Highness.

519
00:40:34,940 --> 00:40:38,170
I will orchestrate your father's downfall,

520
00:40:38,770 --> 00:40:40,640
and all you have to do is hold this ring.

521
00:40:41,710 --> 00:40:46,620
The wind will always blow, so just breathe easy...

522
00:40:47,050 --> 00:40:48,080
and smile often.

523
00:40:49,080 --> 00:40:50,720
You deserve to be happy,

524
00:40:51,220 --> 00:40:52,220
my precious,

525
00:40:52,960 --> 00:40:54,120
my dear U Hui.

526
00:41:02,830 --> 00:41:03,830
U Hui!

527
00:41:04,900 --> 00:41:05,900
Kim U Hui!

528
00:41:09,340 --> 00:41:10,710
Is that not Grand Prince Je Un?

529
00:41:12,070 --> 00:41:13,080
I love you!

530
00:41:14,140 --> 00:41:15,740
I love you, Kim U Hui!

531
00:41:18,910 --> 00:41:21,680
- Seize him! He is over there! - Get him!

532
00:41:30,630 --> 00:41:31,930
What are we going to do?

533
00:41:32,590 --> 00:41:34,300
I think he has really lost his mind.

534
00:41:39,470 --> 00:41:40,470
What was that?

535
00:41:40,970 --> 00:41:42,070
Grand Prince Je Un?

536
00:41:42,500 --> 00:41:45,410
Yes, it was unmistakably him.

537
00:41:45,540 --> 00:41:47,140
I came at once,

538
00:41:47,210 --> 00:41:48,680
fearing what he might do next.

539
00:41:49,580 --> 00:41:52,780
I fear he may have lost his mind.

540
00:41:53,150 --> 00:41:55,350
If he has not lost his mind,

541
00:41:56,690 --> 00:41:58,690
then he must have a death wish.

542
00:42:07,430 --> 00:42:09,870
- Something feels off. - I know, right?

543
00:42:10,130 --> 00:42:12,269
If he were sane, he would not dare say that...

544
00:42:12,270 --> 00:42:13,870
in front of the Detached Palace.

545
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:15,970
Of course not.

546
00:42:17,940 --> 00:42:19,210
It is not like him at all.

547
00:42:23,810 --> 00:42:25,550
What on earth could he be thinking?

548
00:42:27,550 --> 00:42:28,820
Are you finished, Your Royal Highness?

549
00:42:29,050 --> 00:42:32,050
Yes. Take this royal edict to the Royal Investigation Office,

550
00:42:32,290 --> 00:42:34,219
and have the former Chief Royal Secretary and that court lady...

551
00:42:34,220 --> 00:42:36,560
Your Royal Highness!

552
00:42:36,760 --> 00:42:38,590
What is it now? What?

553
00:42:39,330 --> 00:42:42,660
Grand Prince Je Un made a scene in front of the Detached Palace.

554
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:44,600
A scene? What kind?

555
00:42:45,170 --> 00:42:47,740
He was shouting the Crown Princess Consort's name over and over,

556
00:42:48,370 --> 00:42:52,740
screamed, "I love you," and made a huge scene.

557
00:42:53,340 --> 00:42:55,380
Seriously, what on earth is wrong with him?

558
00:42:56,210 --> 00:42:58,110
Does he have a death wish or something?

559
00:42:58,710 --> 00:43:01,550
Look at this mess the Left State Councillor has caused.

560
00:43:02,250 --> 00:43:05,650
If it were not for him, everyone would be happy.

561
00:43:06,620 --> 00:43:07,620
The Left State Councillor...

562
00:43:08,960 --> 00:43:10,760
Can we not just kill him?

563
00:43:12,530 --> 00:43:14,960
Gang, do not do anything. Just...

564
00:43:16,100 --> 00:43:17,130
stay out of it.

565
00:44:04,510 --> 00:44:05,610
Left State Councillor!

566
00:44:23,830 --> 00:44:24,830
Who goes there?

567
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:30,010
Stand back.

568
00:44:32,570 --> 00:44:34,410
If any of you interfere in this fight,

569
00:44:34,910 --> 00:44:36,850
I will cut you down myself.

570
00:44:37,610 --> 00:44:39,610
- Yes, my lord. - Yes, my lord.

571
00:44:41,980 --> 00:44:44,120
I thought you had lost your mind,

572
00:44:44,750 --> 00:44:47,090
but it seems you have simply lost your will to live.

573
00:44:47,820 --> 00:44:48,920
That is because...

574
00:44:51,860 --> 00:44:54,530
you took away my reason for living.

575
00:45:40,440 --> 00:45:43,010
You have quite the romantic streak.

576
00:45:43,850 --> 00:45:44,880
Your escape,

577
00:45:45,480 --> 00:45:46,920
the scene at the Detached Palace,

578
00:45:48,250 --> 00:45:50,450
and your last wish just now.

579
00:45:51,650 --> 00:45:53,260
I am not finished.

580
00:46:09,440 --> 00:46:10,870
The more I think about it,

581
00:46:11,240 --> 00:46:13,580
the more I am convinced I must kill you.

582
00:46:43,370 --> 00:46:45,270
- My lord! - Stay back.

583
00:46:47,380 --> 00:46:48,440
Die.

584
00:46:48,710 --> 00:46:49,780
Die!

585
00:46:51,210 --> 00:46:53,080
Die!

586
00:46:57,620 --> 00:46:59,520
- Je Un! - Grand Prince!

587
00:47:06,830 --> 00:47:09,860
- Let go! Let me go! - Get Je Un out of here!

588
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:11,500
- Yes, Your Royal Highness! - I said, let go!

589
00:47:14,400 --> 00:47:16,840
Let me go. Let go!

590
00:47:17,840 --> 00:47:19,010
Left State Councillor!

591
00:47:19,470 --> 00:47:20,540
Left State Councillor!

592
00:47:21,180 --> 00:47:22,640
Left State Councillor!

593
00:47:23,040 --> 00:47:24,580
Let go! Let go of me!

594
00:47:25,010 --> 00:47:27,250
- My lord. - Left State Councillor...

595
00:47:27,520 --> 00:47:29,150
Left State Councillor!

596
00:47:31,420 --> 00:47:33,090
Left State Councillor!

597
00:47:45,800 --> 00:47:46,840
Though it was not my intention,

598
00:47:47,940 --> 00:47:49,500
I now owe you my life.

599
00:47:59,010 --> 00:48:00,420
Why did you go easy on him?

600
00:48:05,220 --> 00:48:06,220
I guess...

601
00:48:07,160 --> 00:48:09,590
my blade hesitated.

602
00:48:14,060 --> 00:48:16,970
So, shall we pretend today never happened either?

603
00:48:17,600 --> 00:48:18,870
I would appreciate that.

604
00:48:20,400 --> 00:48:22,440
The more secrets we share,

605
00:48:22,800 --> 00:48:26,780
the closer we become, Your Royal Highness.

606
00:48:27,380 --> 00:48:28,380
Just like...

607
00:48:29,240 --> 00:48:31,450
His Majesty and I.

608
00:48:36,420 --> 00:48:38,250
Speaking of which,

609
00:48:39,250 --> 00:48:40,520
if I were to die,

610
00:48:40,990 --> 00:48:43,290
someone else will release the secret pact.

611
00:48:44,060 --> 00:48:45,930
I just thought you should know.

612
00:48:47,530 --> 00:48:48,560
I appreciate the information.

613
00:49:03,450 --> 00:49:05,950
- Let go of me! - Please calm down, my lord.

614
00:49:06,010 --> 00:49:07,820
- Please! - No, you cannot.

615
00:49:07,880 --> 00:49:09,780
- Just let me... - You cannot, my lord.

616
00:49:11,090 --> 00:49:13,760
Did you not know killing the Left State Councillor meant execution?

617
00:49:14,390 --> 00:49:16,730
Do you think I came here without knowing that?

618
00:49:17,360 --> 00:49:19,930
Why did you stop me? Why?

619
00:49:26,370 --> 00:49:29,570
So this is the brilliant plan you made after drinking for days?

620
00:49:30,240 --> 00:49:32,640
To kill the Left State Councillor and die along with him?

621
00:49:34,710 --> 00:49:35,710
Yes.

622
00:49:36,140 --> 00:49:39,910
Everyone knows this fight is over when the Left State Councillor dies.

623
00:49:39,980 --> 00:49:41,180
If only he dies!

624
00:49:43,250 --> 00:49:47,260
The abdication stops, and U Hui will not be a traitor's daughter!

625
00:49:48,020 --> 00:49:49,060
Then what about me?

626
00:49:50,660 --> 00:49:51,730
And the woman you love?

627
00:49:52,730 --> 00:49:54,200
How is Kim U Hui supposed to live?

628
00:50:01,470 --> 00:50:02,470
I...

629
00:50:06,110 --> 00:50:08,210
I want to live too.

630
00:50:08,780 --> 00:50:11,610
I want to live a happy life with U Hui. But...

631
00:50:12,810 --> 00:50:14,620
there is no other way, is there?

632
00:50:24,730 --> 00:50:25,730
Je Un.

633
00:50:26,460 --> 00:50:28,460
If a path is blocked, we will force it open.

634
00:50:29,660 --> 00:50:31,400
If there is no path, we will make one.

635
00:50:33,300 --> 00:50:35,540
You would rather die than ascend the throne,

636
00:50:36,340 --> 00:50:38,370
and I would rather die than let you die,

637
00:50:39,170 --> 00:50:40,180
So, let us...

638
00:50:41,380 --> 00:50:42,740
find another way.

639
00:50:45,880 --> 00:50:46,950
Let us survive this.

640
00:50:48,820 --> 00:50:50,490
Let us live, Je Un.

641
00:51:07,070 --> 00:51:10,640
If you give the order, we will go and capture Grand Prince Je Un.

642
00:51:11,370 --> 00:51:12,770
I let him go.

643
00:51:14,780 --> 00:51:18,410
Why do you always show such mercy to Grand Prince Je Un?

644
00:51:21,950 --> 00:51:23,180
Bring me a drink.

645
00:51:26,990 --> 00:51:28,020
Here you are.

646
00:51:32,430 --> 00:51:36,260
But I thought you never touched alcohol?

647
00:51:36,530 --> 00:51:37,600
You may leave now.

648
00:51:39,400 --> 00:51:40,400
Yes, my lord.

649
00:52:24,680 --> 00:52:25,680
Am I not...

650
00:52:27,780 --> 00:52:30,290
fighting a losing battle?

651
00:52:38,290 --> 00:52:42,760
What? Even if he was blinded by rage,

652
00:52:42,830 --> 00:52:45,100
what was he thinking, going to the Left State Councillor's house alone?

653
00:52:45,270 --> 00:52:46,530
He went there to die.

654
00:52:48,070 --> 00:52:51,110
That Grand Prince Je Un really needs a good scolding.

655
00:52:52,010 --> 00:52:53,910
He has no regard for his own life.

656
00:52:55,140 --> 00:52:56,380
I am the one who should be scolded.

657
00:52:57,010 --> 00:52:58,010
Me and my Royal Father.

658
00:52:58,580 --> 00:52:59,879
You are blaming yourself again.

659
00:52:59,880 --> 00:53:01,520
No, I am not. It is damage control.

660
00:53:02,550 --> 00:53:03,790
It seems our path is blocked,

661
00:53:04,290 --> 00:53:05,320
so I am going to force it open.

662
00:53:06,890 --> 00:53:08,420
Do you have a plan?

663
00:53:09,360 --> 00:53:12,730
The Left State Councillor said his death releases the secret pact.

664
00:53:12,790 --> 00:53:15,760
So he gave it to someone else for safekeeping.

665
00:53:16,300 --> 00:53:17,930
You have anyone in mind?

666
00:53:18,330 --> 00:53:19,330
Choraengi Mask.

667
00:53:20,840 --> 00:53:22,040
Kim Deok Chun.

668
00:53:22,770 --> 00:53:24,140
She is the most likely suspect.

669
00:53:24,410 --> 00:53:25,840
Who is Kim Deok Chun?

670
00:53:26,610 --> 00:53:28,480
She was the daughter of a slave in the Left State Councillor's home.

671
00:53:29,110 --> 00:53:30,480
She was a female Royal Physician.

672
00:53:31,510 --> 00:53:33,650
So she was right under our noses this whole time.

673
00:53:34,380 --> 00:53:37,850
So the Left State Councillor must have given Kim Deok Chun something.

674
00:53:39,120 --> 00:53:41,860
But is Choraengi Mask not in hiding?

675
00:53:42,660 --> 00:53:43,660
Then we will find her.

676
00:53:44,030 --> 00:53:46,460
We got through a collapsed cave. We are capable of anything.

677
00:53:47,930 --> 00:53:50,570
I will start by digging into the Cheonghye Merchant Guild.

678
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:52,300
The Cheonghye Merchant Guild?

679
00:53:52,970 --> 00:53:57,110
Did Choraengi Mask use that guild to import the Jimjo feed?

680
00:53:59,670 --> 00:54:01,410
Since it is a merchant guild,

681
00:54:01,810 --> 00:54:03,510
we can just find them through the Hanyang Merchant Guild.

682
00:54:04,050 --> 00:54:07,480
As Head Merchant, he knows all guilds inside and out.

683
00:54:17,290 --> 00:54:19,130
Come to the Royal Office of Attire by tomorrow afternoon.

684
00:54:19,560 --> 00:54:21,530
I am looking for a way to defeat the Left State Councillor.

685
00:54:30,370 --> 00:54:33,570
Is that what you call a disguise?

686
00:54:36,110 --> 00:54:37,110
Gosh, you!

687
00:54:37,650 --> 00:54:41,150
Have you lost your mind? I know you want the tiger, but this?

688
00:54:41,450 --> 00:54:44,520
If you go into the tiger's den alone on a suicide mission,

689
00:54:45,120 --> 00:54:46,590
what are the rest of us going to do?

690
00:54:46,920 --> 00:54:47,920
What?

691
00:54:48,520 --> 00:54:50,190
When His Highness told me about it yesterday,

692
00:54:50,490 --> 00:54:52,330
my heart just dropped. Did you know that?

693
00:54:57,070 --> 00:54:59,570
I am sorry to have worried you, Your Highness.

694
00:55:00,170 --> 00:55:01,670
Do not dare die.

695
00:55:03,240 --> 00:55:05,510
No matter how cruel and twisted this world gets,

696
00:55:06,810 --> 00:55:08,510
do not just give in and die.

697
00:55:10,680 --> 00:55:12,880
When you are dead, you cannot remember those you love,

698
00:55:14,120 --> 00:55:16,250
and those who remember you can no longer hold you.

699
00:55:17,350 --> 00:55:18,650
What a terrible waste that would be.

700
00:55:19,420 --> 00:55:20,560
And so unfair.

701
00:55:28,400 --> 00:55:29,400
So...

702
00:55:31,600 --> 00:55:32,770
do not throw it all away.

703
00:55:37,770 --> 00:55:38,810
Let us stay alive.

704
00:55:39,410 --> 00:55:40,410
Okay?

705
00:55:45,210 --> 00:55:46,380
Hold it right there.

706
00:55:48,650 --> 00:55:51,520
- Gang. - Your Royal Highness.

707
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:05,430
Are you just going to keep staring?

708
00:56:06,870 --> 00:56:09,470
Do not mind me. I am just...

709
00:56:10,570 --> 00:56:13,670
a sitting sticky rice cake. Just think of me that way.

710
00:56:14,840 --> 00:56:15,840
I see.

711
00:56:16,340 --> 00:56:19,010
Would not a sitting sticky rice cake be even more distracting?

712
00:56:27,290 --> 00:56:28,290
So,

713
00:56:28,590 --> 00:56:29,660
what about the thing I asked you to check?

714
00:56:30,020 --> 00:56:31,030
Yes, Your Royal Highness.

715
00:56:32,530 --> 00:56:33,960
According to the Head Merchant,

716
00:56:34,030 --> 00:56:36,700
the Cheonghye Guild was made by the men from The Nameless...

717
00:56:36,760 --> 00:56:38,900
as a front for smuggling.

718
00:56:39,100 --> 00:56:40,100
The Nameless?

719
00:56:40,170 --> 00:56:42,240
Yes. They are called The Nameless because they have no name...

720
00:56:42,300 --> 00:56:44,410
and also because they shun the light.

721
00:56:44,540 --> 00:56:48,109
Your Highness, they use loan-sharking for human trafficking,

722
00:56:48,110 --> 00:56:50,579
do all kinds of smuggling, and counterfeit coins.

723
00:56:50,580 --> 00:56:52,410
They will do anything for money.

724
00:56:52,480 --> 00:56:55,780
- They are just vile scoundrels. - They are lower than animals.

725
00:56:56,020 --> 00:56:57,990
Then how are scoundrels like that still at large?

726
00:56:58,790 --> 00:57:00,860
According to the Head Merchant,

727
00:57:01,120 --> 00:57:03,220
the Left State Councillor is apparently their backer.

728
00:57:04,760 --> 00:57:05,830
The Left State Councillor?

729
00:57:05,960 --> 00:57:08,600
In fact, they have already ruined the market economy,

730
00:57:08,660 --> 00:57:10,530
so the Head Merchant wanted to teach them a lesson,

731
00:57:10,600 --> 00:57:12,900
but even for a man as powerful as the Head Merchant,

732
00:57:13,330 --> 00:57:16,400
the Police Bureau will not listen to him. This clearly...

733
00:57:16,700 --> 00:57:19,940
means their backer must be someone equal to the Left State Councillor.

734
00:57:20,510 --> 00:57:22,540
Back off. Unless you want to lose your heads.

735
00:57:24,550 --> 00:57:27,280
They either have a death wish,

736
00:57:28,380 --> 00:57:30,080
or they follow orders without question.

737
00:57:32,420 --> 00:57:33,990
Do you suspect something?

738
00:57:45,430 --> 00:57:48,300
Shin Won, do you remember what the Sinjusa assassins were wearing?

739
00:57:49,440 --> 00:57:50,440
Yes.

740
00:57:50,910 --> 00:57:53,370
Now that you mention it, the Left State Councillor's men at Jemulpo...

741
00:57:53,440 --> 00:57:55,910
and Sinjusa assassins wore the same clothes, did they not?

742
00:57:56,580 --> 00:57:57,880
My thoughts exactly.

743
00:57:58,380 --> 00:58:00,050
The Choraengi Mask wore the same outfits too.

744
00:58:00,850 --> 00:58:02,920
It means the Crown Princess Consort must know something.

745
00:58:03,220 --> 00:58:05,549
The Detached Palace is too guarded.

746
00:58:05,550 --> 00:58:07,890
We cannot reach the Crown Princess Consort, can we?

747
00:58:09,390 --> 00:58:10,630
That is the problem.

748
00:58:16,400 --> 00:58:17,570
I will do it.

749
00:58:18,700 --> 00:58:19,900
Getting to the Crown Princess Consort,

750
00:58:20,570 --> 00:58:21,640
I will do it.

751
00:58:23,640 --> 00:58:24,970
Do you have a plan?

752
00:58:25,340 --> 00:58:28,880
If one road is blocked, there is always another way around.

753
00:58:37,450 --> 00:58:40,860
Your Majesty. Did you rest well last night?

754
00:58:41,420 --> 00:58:42,590
What is it now?

755
00:58:43,090 --> 00:58:44,860
It is a surprise that you came to pay your respects.

756
00:58:50,030 --> 00:58:51,070
Since I...

757
00:58:51,470 --> 00:58:53,270
started living in the palace,

758
00:58:53,730 --> 00:58:56,970
I have found the life of a royal woman to be terribly dull.

759
00:58:57,270 --> 00:58:59,970
So naturally, you came to mind, Your Majesty.

760
00:59:00,340 --> 00:59:02,210
You must want something from me.

761
00:59:02,740 --> 00:59:04,580
Your Majesty, that is hurtful.

762
00:59:04,850 --> 00:59:07,110
How can you twist my pure intentions like that?

763
00:59:08,350 --> 00:59:10,450
Search your heart.

764
00:59:10,720 --> 00:59:12,090
Have you ever once...

765
00:59:12,290 --> 00:59:15,160
come to me out of the goodness of your heart?

766
00:59:21,360 --> 00:59:24,570
Gosh. They do not just let anyone be the Queen Dowager, right?

767
00:59:24,770 --> 00:59:27,600
Your insight is incredible, as always.

768
00:59:29,040 --> 00:59:31,310
Gosh, you and your flattery.

769
00:59:32,870 --> 00:59:33,870
All right, then.

770
00:59:34,540 --> 00:59:36,880
Since you are here, let us hear it.

771
00:59:37,510 --> 00:59:39,910
How will you amuse me today?

772
00:59:41,180 --> 00:59:43,920
You know I used to be a peddler, right?

773
00:59:44,790 --> 00:59:46,990
From my travels all over the eight provinces,

774
00:59:47,120 --> 00:59:50,620
I have collected a lot of juicy stories.

775
00:59:51,260 --> 00:59:52,529
Do not dare.

776
00:59:52,530 --> 00:59:55,830
How dare you bring vulgar stories into the palace?

777
00:59:57,370 --> 01:00:01,740
So, the physician, her husband, and that homewrecker... I mean,

778
01:00:02,200 --> 01:00:03,840
they went to the mistress's family home?

779
01:00:04,140 --> 01:00:07,110
Yes. The physician, bold as brass, said,

780
01:00:08,010 --> 01:00:10,910
"Your daughter has been sleeping with my husband."

781
01:00:11,510 --> 01:00:12,550
And then,

782
01:00:12,910 --> 01:00:15,820
the mistress slapped the physician across the face.

783
01:00:16,620 --> 01:00:17,620
My goodness.

784
01:00:18,020 --> 01:00:21,690
The shameless hussy! And the husband?

785
01:00:22,560 --> 01:00:24,330
What did the husband do?

786
01:00:26,630 --> 01:00:28,860
He grabbed the physician by the hand,

787
01:00:29,500 --> 01:00:32,030
and as he was dragging her out, he yelled,

788
01:00:35,070 --> 01:00:37,270
"Is it a crime to be in love?"

789
01:00:38,270 --> 01:00:39,440
Can you believe the nerve?

790
01:00:39,870 --> 01:00:41,840
That worthless scoundrel!

791
01:00:43,710 --> 01:00:46,850
So there was this good-for-nothing freeloader,

792
01:00:46,910 --> 01:00:51,289
who fell for his wife's best friend, whom she had taken in!

793
01:00:51,290 --> 01:00:52,290
Her friend?

794
01:00:52,291 --> 01:00:53,749
After he kicked out his devoted wife,

795
01:00:53,750 --> 01:00:55,259
her sister saw them getting groceries at the market,

796
01:00:55,260 --> 01:00:56,760
being all lovey-dovey.

797
01:00:56,960 --> 01:01:00,290
When the wife's sister saw that, she would just see red, would she not?

798
01:01:00,390 --> 01:01:01,800
She certainly would.

799
01:01:01,860 --> 01:01:05,600
So she went to confront them, and the mistress dared to say,

800
01:01:06,200 --> 01:01:10,640
"Have some class." So the sister totally snapped.

801
01:01:10,970 --> 01:01:12,240
"Class?"

802
01:01:12,640 --> 01:01:16,680
"This is my class!" Then she grabbed her hair...

803
01:01:16,740 --> 01:01:20,780
and started yanking her head left and right.

804
01:01:20,950 --> 01:01:23,250
- Left, right. - That is the way!

805
01:01:26,790 --> 01:01:28,090
Left.

806
01:01:30,020 --> 01:01:31,460
Right.

807
01:01:40,630 --> 01:01:42,400
Becoming a supportive wife...

808
01:01:44,210 --> 01:01:45,910
is so darn hard.

809
01:01:50,540 --> 01:01:51,550
What?

810
01:01:52,210 --> 01:01:53,910
Ye Na is Seon Jeong's daughter?

811
01:01:54,450 --> 01:01:55,450
Yes.

812
01:01:57,250 --> 01:02:01,460
Now that it is out that Ye Na is Seon Jeong's daughter,

813
01:02:02,890 --> 01:02:06,460
maybe it is time you did me that favour.

814
01:02:11,030 --> 01:02:14,300
My patience has run out. That is why you are here.

815
01:02:14,940 --> 01:02:17,440
You are to be the Crown Princess of this nation.

816
01:02:17,870 --> 01:02:20,070
And yet, you act so thoughtlessly?

817
01:02:20,570 --> 01:02:22,410
Is this how your father raised you?

818
01:02:22,740 --> 01:02:26,180
Crown Princess Consort, you need to reflect on your conduct.

819
01:02:49,140 --> 01:02:52,140
- I need to ask you something first. - Do not worry.

820
01:02:52,440 --> 01:02:54,180
Grand Prince Je Un is safe.

821
01:02:55,280 --> 01:02:58,210
But how did you know I was going to ask about him?

822
01:02:58,310 --> 01:03:02,020
They say only one who has been in love can recognise it.

823
01:03:02,850 --> 01:03:05,090
The feeling of being madly in love but forced to be apart...

824
01:03:05,390 --> 01:03:06,650
You think I would not understand that?

825
01:03:09,290 --> 01:03:11,190
All right, let us get down to business.

826
01:03:14,160 --> 01:03:15,900
The assassins operating at Sinjusa.

827
01:03:16,560 --> 01:03:18,100
Are they part of The Nameless?

828
01:03:20,570 --> 01:03:22,870
And the Choraengi Mask, Kim Deok Chun.

829
01:03:23,570 --> 01:03:26,570
- Is she one of them too? - How do you know that?

830
01:03:26,640 --> 01:03:28,909
We are short on time. Let us get to the point.

831
01:03:28,910 --> 01:03:30,480
Where is their base?

832
01:03:30,710 --> 01:03:32,810
I only know what Deok Chun told me, so I am not sure,

833
01:03:32,880 --> 01:03:34,950
but I heard they have branches in all four corners of the country.

834
01:03:35,480 --> 01:03:38,650
I think I might have heard something about a mountain fortress.

835
01:03:39,350 --> 01:03:40,350
A mountain fortress.

836
01:03:42,120 --> 01:03:43,560
Anything else unusual about them?

837
01:03:44,530 --> 01:03:48,600
Like when Choraengi Mask went there, maybe it took a few days,

838
01:03:48,660 --> 01:03:50,970
or maybe she often bought something. Anything like that.

839
01:03:52,730 --> 01:03:54,699
She would often bring her sick mother...

840
01:03:54,700 --> 01:03:56,500
chestnut honey and some liquor.

841
01:03:57,470 --> 01:03:58,470
Chestnut honey?

842
01:04:00,610 --> 01:04:01,710
What kind of liquor?

843
01:04:03,080 --> 01:04:05,710
I think it might have been pine needle wine.

844
01:04:11,450 --> 01:04:12,450
Is it songyeopju?

845
01:04:13,050 --> 01:04:14,050
Could it be Yangju?

846
01:04:14,960 --> 01:04:16,459
- What? - Yangju chestnuts...

847
01:04:16,460 --> 01:04:19,360
are famous enough to be offered as royal tribute.

848
01:04:19,560 --> 01:04:23,960
Songyeopju is the signature liquor of the Yeosan Song clan in Yangju.

849
01:04:25,030 --> 01:04:27,700
I guess I should tell them to search Yangju first.

850
01:04:30,540 --> 01:04:33,310
If you find Deok Chun, please tell her to come see me.

851
01:04:34,480 --> 01:04:36,510
Tell her I have something urgent to discuss about her mother.

852
01:04:40,880 --> 01:04:43,450
Forgive me. We still have not gotten the Royal Concubine's family...

853
01:04:43,520 --> 01:04:45,550
out of Unjeong Palace.

854
01:04:45,990 --> 01:04:47,320
What about the head of Eunwol Pavilion?

855
01:04:47,720 --> 01:04:50,459
We have not made contact with them.

856
01:04:50,460 --> 01:04:52,390
Hong Nan was in hiding.

857
01:04:53,290 --> 01:04:56,300
So why would she suddenly appear at Eunwol Pavilion?

858
01:04:56,800 --> 01:04:58,630
I will capture Eunwol Pavilion's head at once.

859
01:05:07,370 --> 01:05:10,010
There were dozens of assassins at Sinjusa alone.

860
01:05:10,910 --> 01:05:12,610
This organisation must be massive.

861
01:05:12,880 --> 01:05:15,220
If they have branches across all eight provinces,

862
01:05:15,650 --> 01:05:17,080
this is no small-scale operation.

863
01:05:18,320 --> 01:05:19,790
There must be hundreds of them, at least.

864
01:05:20,890 --> 01:05:24,430
The Nameless. A group so large is basically a private army.

865
01:05:25,330 --> 01:05:26,430
This is treason.

866
01:05:27,090 --> 01:05:28,600
According to this letter from Dal,

867
01:05:29,460 --> 01:05:30,830
the Choraengi Mask is in Yangju,

868
01:05:31,130 --> 01:05:32,800
and The Nameless are in a mountain fortress.

869
01:05:33,470 --> 01:05:36,270
Let us search the nearby mountains. We are bound to find something.

870
01:05:37,640 --> 01:05:39,940
Should I grab a map on the way, then?

871
01:05:40,740 --> 01:05:42,240
I saw a stall selling them on our way here.

872
01:05:48,920 --> 01:05:50,919
- What can I help you find? - We are headed to the mountains.

873
01:05:50,920 --> 01:05:53,650
- The mountains? Which ones? - Hey.

874
01:05:54,150 --> 01:05:56,519
- It is right here. - Those mountains.

875
01:05:56,520 --> 01:05:57,890
- Let us see. - It is marked plain as day.

876
01:05:59,230 --> 01:06:01,700
- Here we go. This should do. - How much for this?

877
01:06:03,730 --> 01:06:04,730
His Majesty?

878
01:06:12,140 --> 01:06:13,909
If she rashly escapes, it could give...

879
01:06:13,910 --> 01:06:16,340
the Left State Councillor the pretext he needs,

880
01:06:16,840 --> 01:06:19,180
so for now, I intend to keep the Royal Concubine here.

881
01:06:19,680 --> 01:06:21,920
From the moment you brought the royal guards to Unjeong Palace,

882
01:06:23,250 --> 01:06:24,690
it shows...

883
01:06:25,690 --> 01:06:27,250
that you are worried, Your Majesty.

884
01:06:28,990 --> 01:06:32,630
You have only ever cared about His Highness.

885
01:06:34,160 --> 01:06:36,960
You never thought of Her Highness, the Crown Princess.

886
01:06:38,300 --> 01:06:40,300
And now, because you are worried His Royal Highness might get hurt,

887
01:06:40,800 --> 01:06:43,370
are you going to send Her Highness to her death all over again?

888
01:06:45,540 --> 01:06:46,570
Yes.

889
01:06:47,070 --> 01:06:49,840
Just as you said, my son is my only concern.

890
01:06:52,080 --> 01:06:55,050
However, the Crown Princess is his only concern.

891
01:06:57,020 --> 01:06:58,150
Therefore, the Crown Princess...

892
01:06:59,720 --> 01:07:00,720
No.

893
01:07:01,860 --> 01:07:03,590
Protecting the Royal Concubine...

894
01:07:05,190 --> 01:07:06,290
is how I protect...

895
01:07:06,860 --> 01:07:08,700
the Crown Prince, my son.

896
01:07:16,070 --> 01:07:17,070
Gang.

897
01:07:18,110 --> 01:07:19,210
What...

898
01:07:21,510 --> 01:07:23,610
What in the world are you talking about?

899
01:07:26,280 --> 01:07:27,350
What do you mean the Royal Concubine...

900
01:07:29,650 --> 01:07:31,190
is the Crown Princess?

901
01:07:34,020 --> 01:07:36,560
- It is just... - Tell me what happened!

902
01:07:41,760 --> 01:07:42,860
I am so sorry.

903
01:07:56,010 --> 01:07:57,080
Five years ago,

904
01:07:58,110 --> 01:07:59,550
afraid she might bring you harm, Your Highness,

905
01:08:00,280 --> 01:08:02,480
she threw herself into the river.

906
01:08:03,950 --> 01:08:06,190
She lost all her memories then.

907
01:08:08,190 --> 01:08:10,720
Right now, Her Highness herself...

908
01:08:12,160 --> 01:08:14,160
knows who she is.

909
01:08:15,060 --> 01:08:17,560
I am going to stick to you like glue, Your Highness.

910
01:08:18,530 --> 01:08:20,330
I am never letting you go.

911
01:08:39,720 --> 01:08:41,290
Your Highness!

912
01:08:51,370 --> 01:08:53,569
- Your Highness! - Where is the Royal Concubine?

913
01:08:53,570 --> 01:08:54,940
She should be in the Royal Kitchen.

914
01:08:58,340 --> 01:08:59,540
Your Highness.

915
01:09:06,250 --> 01:09:09,280
She went to the Eastern Palace, saying she had something for you.

916
01:09:13,650 --> 01:09:14,660
Your Highness.

917
01:09:16,660 --> 01:09:18,389
- Where is the Royal Concubine? - She left...

918
01:09:18,390 --> 01:09:19,930
to her quarters after waiting, Your Highness.

919
01:10:14,820 --> 01:10:16,350
When I opened my eyes,

920
01:10:17,180 --> 01:10:18,790
my mind was completely blank,

921
01:10:19,620 --> 01:10:21,220
but my memory was just a black void.

922
01:10:22,020 --> 01:10:23,760
A life where I do not have to run anymore.

923
01:10:24,360 --> 01:10:25,590
A life where I can settle down...

924
01:10:26,960 --> 01:10:28,700
and make a real family of my own.

925
01:10:30,160 --> 01:10:31,829
Leave Hanyang this instant.

926
01:10:31,830 --> 01:10:33,330
This is the price someone as lowly as you...

927
01:10:34,640 --> 01:10:36,240
has to pay for having a face like yours.

928
01:10:36,540 --> 01:10:37,970
That is why you are so angry, is it not?

929
01:10:38,170 --> 01:10:39,710
Because someone as lowly as myself...

930
01:10:42,080 --> 01:10:44,280
looks like the Crown Princess.

931
01:10:46,350 --> 01:10:48,380
Because of me, that precious woman...

932
01:10:53,350 --> 01:10:54,550
On those small feet,

933
01:11:00,260 --> 01:11:01,930
she walked such a long and difficult road back to me.

934
01:11:04,930 --> 01:11:06,070
All because of me.

935
01:11:08,900 --> 01:11:10,040
All because of me.

936
01:11:14,640 --> 01:11:15,640
Your Highness.

937
01:11:48,180 --> 01:11:49,940
Your Highness, is something the matter?

938
01:11:59,890 --> 01:12:01,690
They say if you catch a falling flower petal...

939
01:12:06,960 --> 01:12:10,030
Do you know what happens if you catch a falling flower petal?

940
01:12:32,420 --> 01:12:33,420
I...

941
01:12:35,920 --> 01:12:37,420
must have caught two.

942
01:12:44,030 --> 01:12:45,230
After all, my first love and I...

943
01:12:49,140 --> 01:12:51,770
ended up married twice.

944
01:13:07,090 --> 01:13:08,220
I...

945
01:13:09,060 --> 01:13:10,490
I am so sorry.

946
01:13:11,930 --> 01:13:13,490
I am so sorry.

947
01:13:15,230 --> 01:13:16,360
For far too long,

948
01:13:17,900 --> 01:13:20,600
I left you all alone.

949
01:13:23,140 --> 01:13:24,810
I am so sorry.

950
01:13:33,010 --> 01:13:34,010
At a time like this,

951
01:13:36,250 --> 01:13:39,290
you should not be on your knees. You should be holding me.

952
01:13:52,930 --> 01:13:54,370
Like you will never let go.

953
01:14:17,790 --> 01:14:18,790
I am sorry.

954
01:14:36,640 --> 01:14:41,620
(Moon River)

955
01:15:02,640 --> 01:15:05,040
What if we just ran away?

956
01:15:05,310 --> 01:15:09,710
- A letter was outside your room. - Identify yourself, Your Highness.

957
01:15:10,280 --> 01:15:13,750
What can His Royal Highness possibly do?

958
01:15:13,810 --> 01:15:16,350
Harbouring a traitor is a grave offence.

959
01:15:16,420 --> 01:15:17,550
Stop the execution!

960
01:15:19,190 --> 01:15:22,560
The Royal Concubine... No, Deposed Crown Princess Gang...

961
01:15:23,190 --> 01:15:24,520
is hereby sentenced to death by hanging.

962
01:15:40,540 --> 01:15:45,050
(Moon River)
