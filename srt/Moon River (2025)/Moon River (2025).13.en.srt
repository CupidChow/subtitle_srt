1
00:00:09,031 --> 00:00:10,370
(All people, incidents, and backgrounds...)

2
00:00:10,371 --> 00:00:11,870
(in this drama are fictitious and unrelated to reality.)

3
00:00:11,871 --> 00:00:13,101
(Also, children and animals were filmed under production guidelines.)

4
00:00:26,481 --> 00:00:27,491
Please stop.

5
00:00:28,151 --> 00:00:29,151
Please stop.

6
00:00:30,351 --> 00:00:32,691
- Oh, my. Your sash is crooked.
- What is your problem?

7
00:00:40,871 --> 00:00:43,941
What are you waiting for? Beat them to a pulp!

8
00:00:58,451 --> 00:00:59,451
What on earth?

9
00:01:45,161 --> 00:01:48,401
How dare you glare at me, you jerk?

10
00:01:49,301 --> 00:01:50,301
No!

11
00:01:55,811 --> 00:01:57,911
It seems you truly have a death wish.

12
00:01:58,811 --> 00:01:59,811
Very well.

13
00:02:00,411 --> 00:02:02,881
- Die!
- What do you think you are doing?

14
00:02:22,031 --> 00:02:25,501
It is hard for a ruined noblewoman to be a brewer.

15
00:02:25,941 --> 00:02:27,641
I imagine you have to deal with plenty of scoundrels.

16
00:02:29,311 --> 00:02:31,741
Your father must be weeping in the skies.

17
00:02:32,341 --> 00:02:34,251
So, stay firm.

18
00:02:37,081 --> 00:02:38,221
And you, get stronger.

19
00:02:38,621 --> 00:02:41,921
I would have won if that geezer had not fought dirty.

20
00:02:43,021 --> 00:02:44,521
All talk from a sore loser.

21
00:02:44,821 --> 00:02:45,861
Come on.

22
00:02:48,191 --> 00:02:49,391
Thank you, my lord.

23
00:02:50,191 --> 00:02:53,301
Of course. If you get in trouble, come straight to me.

24
00:02:55,031 --> 00:02:57,901
I will protect this fledgling until he is ready to leave the nest.

25
00:02:58,501 --> 00:02:59,501
I am leaving.

26
00:03:08,151 --> 00:03:09,151
Let me see.

27
00:03:09,951 --> 00:03:12,851
Oh, no. This is going to leave a scar.

28
00:03:28,371 --> 00:03:30,171
Are you even training properly for the military service exam?

29
00:03:31,101 --> 00:03:32,741
Do you want to spend your life as a good-for-nothing?

30
00:03:34,671 --> 00:03:36,471
You have to pass this time!

31
00:03:41,251 --> 00:03:42,851
Once I pass the military service examination,

32
00:03:43,381 --> 00:03:44,881
and I am strong enough to protect you,

33
00:03:45,781 --> 00:03:48,251
then can I be your husband?

34
00:03:53,021 --> 00:03:54,191
Pass the exam first, then we will talk.

35
00:04:05,401 --> 00:04:06,941
- What do we do?
- Oh, dear.

36
00:04:07,511 --> 00:04:08,611
First in the military service exam.

37
00:04:09,341 --> 00:04:10,341
Kim Han Chul.

38
00:04:14,551 --> 00:04:16,451
How much is this hairpin?

39
00:04:16,781 --> 00:04:17,781
It is 100 nyang.

40
00:04:18,451 --> 00:04:19,451
It is 100 nyang?

41
00:04:20,751 --> 00:04:24,291
- Then what about this one?
- Yes. That one is 50 nyang.

42
00:04:25,191 --> 00:04:28,191
The cheapest one I have is 15 nyang.

43
00:04:35,831 --> 00:04:36,831
A gift for you.

44
00:04:48,211 --> 00:04:49,211
It is a hair ribbon.

45
00:04:49,481 --> 00:04:51,551
I hear the Marriage Ban is about to be issued.

46
00:05:19,881 --> 00:05:22,581
For the military exam's top scorer to be the last one to stay...

47
00:05:23,251 --> 00:05:26,581
and train each day. Is that not a bit unfair?

48
00:05:26,981 --> 00:05:27,991
Your Majesty.

49
00:05:29,091 --> 00:05:30,321
How did you know I was here?

50
00:05:30,721 --> 00:05:32,361
Were you not hoping I would notice?

51
00:05:33,991 --> 00:05:34,991
Have a seat.

52
00:05:35,731 --> 00:05:36,731
Yes, Your Majesty.

53
00:05:40,161 --> 00:05:42,831
Tell me, what is your dream?

54
00:05:46,601 --> 00:05:49,311
My dream is to become stronger.

55
00:05:50,441 --> 00:05:51,881
There is someone I wish to protect.

56
00:05:52,241 --> 00:05:55,781
I see. We are kindred spirits, then. Our dreams are the same.

57
00:05:57,821 --> 00:06:00,651
How could I be a kindred spirit, Your Majesty?

58
00:06:00,721 --> 00:06:02,251
Those who share the same aspirations are kindred spirits.

59
00:06:04,691 --> 00:06:06,191
And those who share a meal are friends.

60
00:06:08,891 --> 00:06:10,861
I am grateful for your grace, Your Majesty.

61
00:06:19,441 --> 00:06:21,741
A gift from your new friend.

62
00:06:29,851 --> 00:06:31,921
Finally, I can breathe a little easier.

63
00:06:32,321 --> 00:06:33,951
The palace is suffocating enough as it is.

64
00:06:34,921 --> 00:06:37,791
And if I must have this wedding to a woman my Royal Mother chose,

65
00:06:38,091 --> 00:06:39,121
I might just suffocate to death.

66
00:06:41,491 --> 00:06:42,531
Who are you men?

67
00:06:43,391 --> 00:06:45,761
How about you hand over any money you have?

68
00:06:46,801 --> 00:06:47,831
Please stay back.

69
00:06:49,671 --> 00:06:52,241
I have three bites left. Finish them off before I am done.

70
00:07:17,531 --> 00:07:18,531
Your Majesty!

71
00:07:21,771 --> 00:07:24,401
I was the one fighting. Why are you the one who got hurt?

72
00:07:24,601 --> 00:07:27,641
That is what friends are for. Sharing the pain.

73
00:07:29,011 --> 00:07:31,411
We cannot go back to the palace like this.

74
00:07:31,841 --> 00:07:33,581
Is there somewhere we can get this treated?

75
00:07:37,081 --> 00:07:38,651
Please come to my house.

76
00:07:42,091 --> 00:07:43,191
I am coming in.

77
00:07:53,101 --> 00:07:54,371
She is my neighbour.

78
00:07:54,831 --> 00:07:55,831
I see.

79
00:07:56,371 --> 00:07:58,641
Please do me a favour and help me.

80
00:08:16,391 --> 00:08:19,791
Why would you give this greenhouse to me?

81
00:08:20,791 --> 00:08:23,231
- This is too much.
- A thank you for the other day.

82
00:08:23,931 --> 00:08:25,101
And a bribe of sorts.

83
00:08:26,601 --> 00:08:28,101
To get on your good side.

84
00:08:33,171 --> 00:08:34,171
What do you think?

85
00:08:34,441 --> 00:08:36,411
We look pretty good together, do we not?

86
00:08:45,351 --> 00:08:46,351
My apologies.

87
00:08:46,721 --> 00:08:48,951
Please forgive my rudeness for leaving first.

88
00:09:01,571 --> 00:09:04,131
You said you wanted to be strong to protect someone, did you not?

89
00:09:04,941 --> 00:09:07,271
That must be Lady Ji Hye.

90
00:09:08,611 --> 00:09:10,741
But compared to a mere military man like you,

91
00:09:11,641 --> 00:09:13,941
do you not think I can protect her better as the King?

92
00:09:14,381 --> 00:09:16,881
And it is not like you would ever defy me.

93
00:09:17,651 --> 00:09:18,651
We are friends, after all.

94
00:09:30,391 --> 00:09:33,561
Are you not even angry? How can you just stand by and watch?

95
00:09:34,331 --> 00:09:35,371
His Majesty...

96
00:09:36,371 --> 00:09:38,771
will protect you better than anyone else.

97
00:09:40,301 --> 00:09:41,371
Because he is the King.

98
00:09:42,541 --> 00:09:44,941
I am no match for him.

99
00:09:45,941 --> 00:09:47,881
He is the most powerful man in the world.

100
00:10:04,291 --> 00:10:05,631
I am going to blow out the candle.

101
00:10:28,321 --> 00:10:31,061
- A firstborn prince, Your Majesty.
- A son.

102
00:10:34,321 --> 00:10:35,331
And the Queen?

103
00:10:37,361 --> 00:10:40,661
- Is she all right?
- Yes, Her Highness is safe as well.

104
00:11:08,231 --> 00:11:11,861
I simply cannot ignore that prophecy.

105
00:11:12,061 --> 00:11:14,031
Are you speaking of the Queen again?

106
00:11:14,571 --> 00:11:17,571
- She has not committed any crime.
- A crime? We can just invent one.

107
00:11:19,441 --> 00:11:20,871
Your Majesty!

108
00:11:21,311 --> 00:11:24,941
You must punish the Queen severely for her adultery!

109
00:11:25,011 --> 00:11:26,911
How could Her Highness commit adultery?

110
00:11:27,611 --> 00:11:31,381
Your Majesty, I beg of you, please clear Her Highness's name!

111
00:11:33,121 --> 00:11:35,751
The man in the affair with the Queen has confessed.

112
00:11:36,921 --> 00:11:38,761
I lost to my Royal Mother.

113
00:11:39,291 --> 00:11:42,831
You should see the Queen off on her final journey.

114
00:12:10,521 --> 00:12:12,091
How did you get in here?

115
00:12:12,921 --> 00:12:15,461
His Majesty will serve you the royal poison tomorrow.

116
00:12:16,031 --> 00:12:17,791
You have to escape now.

117
00:12:18,601 --> 00:12:19,601
Where do you...

118
00:12:20,501 --> 00:12:21,631
expect me to go?

119
00:12:21,931 --> 00:12:23,801
I will take you.

120
00:12:24,671 --> 00:12:28,641
I will protect you, Your Highness. So please come away with me.

121
00:12:38,921 --> 00:12:40,121
If I run away,

122
00:12:41,551 --> 00:12:43,721
the Crown Prince will be known as the son of an adulteress...

123
00:12:44,691 --> 00:12:46,521
and be scorned for the rest of his life.

124
00:12:47,821 --> 00:12:49,931
He might even lose his life.

125
00:12:57,301 --> 00:12:58,801
Can you please just live?

126
00:12:59,871 --> 00:13:01,341
Please, I beg you, live.

127
00:13:02,941 --> 00:13:04,211
Please live.

128
00:13:07,041 --> 00:13:09,681
Please live.

129
00:13:14,451 --> 00:13:15,451
I am sorry.

130
00:14:02,001 --> 00:14:03,931
Put this medicine in the royal poison.

131
00:14:04,641 --> 00:14:06,201
She will vomit some blood,

132
00:14:06,501 --> 00:14:08,271
but it will stop the poison from spreading.

133
00:14:14,911 --> 00:14:18,021
Then give her this antidote as quickly as possible.

134
00:15:13,171 --> 00:15:14,171
Your Highness.

135
00:15:17,941 --> 00:15:20,281
Your Highness. Are you all right?

136
00:15:23,781 --> 00:15:24,781
Your Highness?

137
00:15:27,221 --> 00:15:28,221
Un.

138
00:15:29,221 --> 00:15:30,221
My Un.

139
00:15:34,491 --> 00:15:35,491
Un.

140
00:15:39,461 --> 00:15:40,501
Un.

141
00:15:44,971 --> 00:15:46,941
- My Un.
- Your Highness.

142
00:15:47,541 --> 00:15:48,641
What is wrong?

143
00:15:52,411 --> 00:15:53,411
Who are you?

144
00:15:55,351 --> 00:15:56,551
Your Highness.

145
00:16:21,871 --> 00:16:25,311
I gave up a queen and protected much in return,

146
00:16:25,941 --> 00:16:28,411
so I suppose it was a fair trade.

147
00:16:30,351 --> 00:16:31,781
Did you not...

148
00:16:32,781 --> 00:16:35,291
love the Queen?

149
00:16:37,221 --> 00:16:38,221
You promised...

150
00:16:39,461 --> 00:16:41,061
you would protect her.

151
00:16:41,931 --> 00:16:43,591
Did you not?

152
00:16:46,561 --> 00:16:47,961
What I wanted to protect...

153
00:16:48,731 --> 00:16:51,071
was not some foolish emotion like love,

154
00:16:52,771 --> 00:16:53,941
but the throne.

155
00:16:55,311 --> 00:16:56,411
Strong royal authority.

156
00:17:25,071 --> 00:17:28,001
A sword, too, was once merely iron.

157
00:17:29,271 --> 00:17:30,771
The iron became a sword,

158
00:17:32,081 --> 00:17:34,081
and that blade is made to sin...

159
00:17:34,981 --> 00:17:36,711
all because of love.

160
00:17:43,021 --> 00:17:46,721
(Chapter 13: A Sword's Purpose)

161
00:17:47,261 --> 00:17:48,261
The Crown Prince...

162
00:17:51,091 --> 00:17:52,101
The Crown Prince...

163
00:17:52,531 --> 00:17:54,501
sent Je Un to Mount Gamak?

164
00:17:55,001 --> 00:17:56,930
He returned by himself without the Left Flank Guard.

165
00:17:56,931 --> 00:17:59,171
The Crown Princess must be at Mount Gamak.

166
00:17:59,501 --> 00:18:01,271
Should you not send the Royal Guards?

167
00:18:02,341 --> 00:18:04,271
The Left State Councillor is on high alert right now.

168
00:18:05,041 --> 00:18:07,111
I will wait for the opportune moment to make a move.

169
00:18:08,751 --> 00:18:11,050
But is it safe to leave the Crown Princess's family...

170
00:18:11,051 --> 00:18:13,251
at Unjeong Palace?

171
00:18:14,021 --> 00:18:16,421
Right. I trust you to protect them.

172
00:18:16,921 --> 00:18:18,021
Yes, Your Majesty.

173
00:18:18,691 --> 00:18:22,291
It is not safe at Unjeong Palace, so you all must move.

174
00:18:22,461 --> 00:18:24,661
But what about our Dal? What happened to our daughter?

175
00:18:24,861 --> 00:18:28,171
I heard from the servants that the Crown Prince was captured.

176
00:18:28,231 --> 00:18:29,871
Please do not worry.

177
00:18:30,431 --> 00:18:33,941
His Highness sent Grand Prince Un to the Crown Princess.

178
00:18:34,871 --> 00:18:38,071
Where is Her Highness?

179
00:18:41,651 --> 00:18:42,751
Well...

180
00:18:45,021 --> 00:18:46,151
Gamak...

181
00:18:46,681 --> 00:18:48,220
No, you must not.

182
00:18:48,221 --> 00:18:50,921
It is too risky to go to Her Highness.

183
00:18:52,361 --> 00:18:55,691
Hey, how long have you been a palace eunuch?

184
00:18:57,531 --> 00:19:01,331
- I started here in the Gyesa Year.
- Gyesa?

185
00:19:02,601 --> 00:19:03,871
Darn it, Gyesa Year?

186
00:19:06,741 --> 00:19:09,370
How dare a round-faced pipsqueak who became a eunuch in Gyesa Year...

187
00:19:09,371 --> 00:19:11,411
talk back to me?

188
00:19:11,741 --> 00:19:12,741
Let me tell you.

189
00:19:13,581 --> 00:19:14,951
I started back in the Gyeongo Year.

190
00:19:16,781 --> 00:19:21,151
- I see.
- Oh, "you see," is it?

191
00:19:24,451 --> 00:19:27,261
I ought to knock some corners into that round head of yours.

192
00:19:28,091 --> 00:19:30,461
Just tell us. Where is our daughter?

193
00:19:30,531 --> 00:19:33,001
We owe our lives to Her Highness.

194
00:19:34,331 --> 00:19:35,701
Please tell us.

195
00:19:41,671 --> 00:19:42,711
My apologies.

196
00:19:43,571 --> 00:19:45,810
I heard the Crown Princess would leave to Qing.

197
00:19:45,811 --> 00:19:47,911
The Nameless men are lying in ambush...

198
00:19:48,181 --> 00:19:49,881
on all roads, even Jemulpo, to Qing.

199
00:19:53,221 --> 00:19:54,221
Mount Gamak.

200
00:19:54,581 --> 00:19:58,051
I know exactly what you are hiding on Mount Gamak.

201
00:19:58,661 --> 00:19:59,661
If I die here today,

202
00:20:00,261 --> 00:20:02,291
the Crown Prince will reveal your secret.

203
00:20:26,921 --> 00:20:27,921
It is different.

204
00:20:45,871 --> 00:20:46,871
Candle wax.

205
00:21:06,221 --> 00:21:08,691
(Cross Mount Gamak's Ungye bridge, and you will find a forbidden rope.)

206
00:21:11,931 --> 00:21:12,931
Found it.

207
00:21:19,841 --> 00:21:22,211
My lord. Are you sure you will be safe alone?

208
00:21:22,971 --> 00:21:24,211
Let me go with you.

209
00:21:24,271 --> 00:21:27,581
No. Deliver this letter to Eunuch Yoon.

210
00:21:28,611 --> 00:21:29,681
Yes, my lord.

211
00:21:30,451 --> 00:21:32,521
Please be careful.

212
00:21:33,181 --> 00:21:36,091
Do not worry. I can handle myself in a fight.

213
00:22:42,851 --> 00:22:46,021
I found The Nameless' fortress from the military treatise.

214
00:22:46,221 --> 00:22:48,561
I will be back in three days, at the latest.

215
00:22:49,891 --> 00:22:52,231
(Cross Mount Gamak's Ungye bridge, and you will find a forbidden rope.)

216
00:22:56,771 --> 00:22:57,771
Three days.

217
00:23:15,521 --> 00:23:17,791
The Office of Astronomy has chosen an auspicious day.

218
00:23:24,861 --> 00:23:26,431
(Auspicious Day: The Ninth of the Seventh Month)

219
00:23:29,271 --> 00:23:31,031
The auspicious day is two days from now.

220
00:23:32,141 --> 00:23:33,871
So much for not fearing the skies.

221
00:23:35,471 --> 00:23:37,911
Have you finally decided to play the Almighty?

222
00:23:39,181 --> 00:23:40,610
Do you think I do not know it was you...

223
00:23:40,611 --> 00:23:41,881
who chose this "auspicious day"?

224
00:23:42,311 --> 00:23:43,611
Your Majesty.

225
00:23:44,911 --> 00:23:48,221
Do you still believe in the skies?

226
00:23:55,761 --> 00:23:57,291
Time is of the essence.

227
00:23:58,461 --> 00:24:01,831
Please issue the royal edict today and proceed with the Royal Wedding.

228
00:24:04,971 --> 00:24:06,501
By order of the King,

229
00:24:07,171 --> 00:24:09,371
in the matter of the Crown Prince taking a spouse,

230
00:24:09,971 --> 00:24:12,711
we have consulted the skies and chosen an auspicious day.

231
00:24:13,211 --> 00:24:15,710
The ninth day of the seventh month, which is in two days,

232
00:24:15,711 --> 00:24:17,311
is designated for the Royal Wedding,

233
00:24:17,711 --> 00:24:19,781
so it is decreed.

234
00:24:31,761 --> 00:24:32,831
Yeo Ri...

235
00:24:34,401 --> 00:24:36,031
Was she laid to rest properly?

236
00:24:38,201 --> 00:24:39,201
Yes, Your Highness.

237
00:24:40,501 --> 00:24:42,971
Your Highness, about the Royal Wedding in two days...

238
00:24:43,041 --> 00:24:45,241
Send Yeo Ri's mother money for the funeral,

239
00:24:46,181 --> 00:24:47,541
and send her some medicine.

240
00:24:50,251 --> 00:24:53,151
It is the last thing I can do for them.

241
00:24:56,191 --> 00:24:57,591
Pass along that I am sorry.

242
00:24:59,691 --> 00:25:00,691
Yes, Your Highness.

243
00:25:02,991 --> 00:25:06,861
I suppose you wrote the National Code too?

244
00:25:08,131 --> 00:25:11,401
Despite the Royal Order to admit no one,

245
00:25:11,671 --> 00:25:13,171
I see you are an exception.

246
00:25:15,241 --> 00:25:16,871
You look well.

247
00:25:17,811 --> 00:25:20,110
For someone who just sent his wife away to Qing.

248
00:25:20,111 --> 00:25:22,081
I suppose I should be sick with grief.

249
00:25:22,881 --> 00:25:24,051
My apologies.

250
00:25:24,281 --> 00:25:28,181
If I had known Your Highness was the same kind of man as I,

251
00:25:28,951 --> 00:25:31,051
I would have cast you aside long ago.

252
00:25:32,661 --> 00:25:34,191
But it is too late for that.

253
00:25:36,191 --> 00:25:40,001
Why did you return to the palace?

254
00:25:44,001 --> 00:25:46,671
Where have you hidden the Deposed Crown Princess?

255
00:25:48,911 --> 00:25:51,571
What kind of nonsense is this?

256
00:25:51,641 --> 00:25:55,211
I know that you will not give up on your revenge.

257
00:25:56,111 --> 00:25:59,481
And that is why I have come to tell you this.

258
00:26:00,521 --> 00:26:01,621
In two days,

259
00:26:03,691 --> 00:26:04,851
the Royal Wedding will be held.

260
00:26:09,591 --> 00:26:12,731
With that, I will take my leave.

261
00:26:22,611 --> 00:26:24,011
But one thing.

262
00:26:30,611 --> 00:26:32,221
The Deposed Crown Princess is alive,

263
00:26:33,381 --> 00:26:35,791
so why are you still bent on revenge?

264
00:26:38,551 --> 00:26:40,161
She remembers you,

265
00:26:41,421 --> 00:26:43,831
and she is alive and well, is she not?

266
00:26:46,501 --> 00:26:47,961
You tore us apart,

267
00:26:48,901 --> 00:26:50,471
and you ask me why I am dreaming of revenge?

268
00:26:53,371 --> 00:26:54,601
Parting...

269
00:26:58,711 --> 00:27:02,851
The Royal Family is always so greedy.

270
00:27:19,601 --> 00:27:21,001
Sir, the Royal Wedding is in two days.

271
00:27:21,361 --> 00:27:22,871
Are you not pushing yourself too hard?

272
00:27:23,631 --> 00:27:24,871
Let me go alone.

273
00:27:27,801 --> 00:27:28,841
Let us go.

274
00:27:34,381 --> 00:27:36,751
The Left State Councillor has left the capital.

275
00:27:38,251 --> 00:27:39,281
Yes, Your Majesty.

276
00:27:39,851 --> 00:27:42,791
We confirmed he left through Donuimun Gate.

277
00:27:45,521 --> 00:27:46,691
To the Eastern Palace.

278
00:28:01,501 --> 00:28:02,911
- Your Highness.
- Your Highness.

279
00:28:04,641 --> 00:28:05,641
Wait, that is..

280
00:28:07,711 --> 00:28:09,881
- Your Highness!
- Where are you going?

281
00:28:10,111 --> 00:28:11,351
- Your Highness!
- Your Highness!

282
00:28:15,521 --> 00:28:17,520
- Your Highness!
- You are confined.

283
00:28:17,521 --> 00:28:19,121
You cannot leave!

284
00:28:19,961 --> 00:28:21,661
- Come on!
- Your Highness!

285
00:28:22,291 --> 00:28:24,361
- Move! Get out of my way!
- Please go back inside.

286
00:28:24,761 --> 00:28:26,161
- Let go of me!
- Your Highness!

287
00:28:26,561 --> 00:28:30,071
- His Majesty, the King, is here!
- Goodness!

288
00:28:34,571 --> 00:28:35,911
What is the meaning of this?

289
00:28:38,241 --> 00:28:39,781
I refuse to go through with the Royal Wedding.

290
00:28:40,311 --> 00:28:43,051
If I cannot help, the least I can do is not be a burden.

291
00:28:43,951 --> 00:28:45,951
If you run away now, it will all have been for nothing.

292
00:28:46,021 --> 00:28:47,321
I am not trying to run away.

293
00:28:48,151 --> 00:28:51,621
Prince Je Un said he would be back by the day after tomorrow.

294
00:28:52,221 --> 00:28:53,591
He said he would, so he will.

295
00:28:54,921 --> 00:28:55,991
But on the off chance...

296
00:28:57,191 --> 00:28:59,331
that he does not make it back by then,

297
00:29:00,461 --> 00:29:02,771
then I will go. Please lend me the Royal Guards.

298
00:29:03,201 --> 00:29:05,131
I have already sent my most trusted Royal Guards.

299
00:29:05,201 --> 00:29:06,341
I have to go too.

300
00:29:06,641 --> 00:29:08,071
I cannot just send someone into danger...

301
00:29:08,301 --> 00:29:10,711
and then sit back and do nothing myself.

302
00:29:10,811 --> 00:29:11,841
Gang.

303
00:29:13,841 --> 00:29:15,081
Let us have faith in Je Un.

304
00:29:15,811 --> 00:29:18,581
In case Je Un does not return before the wedding procession,

305
00:29:20,181 --> 00:29:21,621
then you go to the Crown Princess.

306
00:29:23,051 --> 00:29:24,651
I will take care of the rest.

307
00:29:26,891 --> 00:29:29,431
Thank you. Thank you, Your Majesty.

308
00:29:51,911 --> 00:29:52,921
Please...

309
00:29:53,651 --> 00:29:55,381
keep His Highness safe.

310
00:29:56,051 --> 00:29:57,091
Please.

311
00:30:01,461 --> 00:30:02,991
Please help me.

312
00:30:03,991 --> 00:30:05,491
Please see me through this.

313
00:30:06,861 --> 00:30:08,131
Let me end all of this...

314
00:30:11,871 --> 00:30:13,441
so I can protect Dal.

315
00:30:17,471 --> 00:30:20,311
I am sorry I am late. I had to be sure I was not followed.

316
00:30:21,241 --> 00:30:22,251
So, you are here.

317
00:30:27,151 --> 00:30:29,551
We were wondering if you would show up or not.

318
00:30:30,151 --> 00:30:32,460
We were worried you would not show.

319
00:30:32,461 --> 00:30:33,891
That is what I meant.

320
00:30:36,561 --> 00:30:38,561
Yes, I was very worried as well.

321
00:30:38,961 --> 00:30:41,761
Do you know how worried I was when I heard what happened?

322
00:30:42,101 --> 00:30:44,201
You could have been killed.

323
00:30:44,731 --> 00:30:46,201
Here we go again.

324
00:30:46,871 --> 00:30:48,841
Why look at another man's woman with such tenderness?

325
00:30:49,941 --> 00:30:51,111
Cut it out.

326
00:30:51,311 --> 00:30:52,340
Please.

327
00:30:52,341 --> 00:30:53,511
Okay?

328
00:30:56,181 --> 00:30:59,351
Back when she was the Crown Princess,

329
00:30:59,851 --> 00:31:01,751
was she always this prickly?

330
00:31:02,051 --> 00:31:06,061
She was not. It must be His Highness's influence.

331
00:31:06,221 --> 00:31:09,231
Like husband, like wife.

332
00:31:09,791 --> 00:31:12,501
It feels like I am with my brother. You feel it too?

333
00:31:12,701 --> 00:31:13,761
I suppose.

334
00:31:14,201 --> 00:31:15,431
I can hear everything you are saying.

335
00:31:15,771 --> 00:31:17,570
You heard that?

336
00:31:17,571 --> 00:31:19,741
I meant for you to, so I am glad.

337
00:31:19,801 --> 00:31:21,941
- Why you...
- Your Highness!

338
00:31:22,271 --> 00:31:23,811
A little decorum, please.

339
00:31:26,311 --> 00:31:29,381
- You brought the military treatise?
- Oh, right.

340
00:31:29,781 --> 00:31:33,451
Of course. Who do you think I am? Let us talk inside.

341
00:31:41,591 --> 00:31:43,361
(Mount Songak)

342
00:31:44,591 --> 00:31:45,931
(Cross Mount Gamak's Ungye bridge, and you will find a forbidden rope.)

343
00:31:49,101 --> 00:31:50,201
Finally.

344
00:31:50,731 --> 00:31:52,701
I have finally found their mountain fortress.

345
00:31:53,141 --> 00:31:56,411
I will go at once. Your Highness, please wait here.

346
00:31:56,471 --> 00:31:57,471
I am going with you.

347
00:31:58,841 --> 00:32:00,181
I will not get in the way.

348
00:32:01,181 --> 00:32:03,011
(Search: Gyeonggi)

349
00:32:07,421 --> 00:32:10,151
(Mount Gamak)

350
00:32:10,791 --> 00:32:14,661
Cross Mount Gamak's Ungye bridge, and you will find a forbidden rope.

351
00:32:16,531 --> 00:32:17,531
Over there.

352
00:32:18,031 --> 00:32:20,131
That is the forbidden rope. Let us go.

353
00:32:24,801 --> 00:32:26,171
Once you pass the forbidden rope,

354
00:32:27,641 --> 00:32:30,571
you will find a fallen birch tree with their symbol on it.

355
00:32:31,011 --> 00:32:32,011
My lord!

356
00:32:37,981 --> 00:32:41,681
Follow the symbols, and they will lead you to the fortress.

357
00:32:41,751 --> 00:32:42,951
(The Nameless's Mountain Fortress)

358
00:32:43,021 --> 00:32:44,721
This is the stronghold of The Nameless.

359
00:32:45,121 --> 00:32:48,691
They deal in counterfeiting coins, illegal weapon manufacturing,

360
00:32:49,291 --> 00:32:50,731
loan sharking, human trafficking, and more.

361
00:32:51,291 --> 00:32:53,561
They are a vicious band of criminals.

362
00:32:59,371 --> 00:33:02,611
I proved the Left State Councillor is the Jimjo's master,

363
00:33:02,771 --> 00:33:06,341
but then this secret pact appeared and made this whole mess.

364
00:33:07,511 --> 00:33:10,581
If the Left State Councillor dies, the secret pact gets released.

365
00:33:10,681 --> 00:33:13,451
That clearly means he entrusted it to someone.

366
00:33:14,881 --> 00:33:17,221
And the most likely suspect is this guy.

367
00:33:17,751 --> 00:33:19,161
The one in the Choraengi Mask.

368
00:33:20,091 --> 00:33:24,891
He used the Cheonghye Merchant Guild to get the Jimjo's feed inside.

369
00:33:25,261 --> 00:33:28,231
And their backer is The Nameless.

370
00:33:29,501 --> 00:33:30,731
The mountain fortress.

371
00:33:32,301 --> 00:33:34,101
Six years ago,

372
00:33:34,901 --> 00:33:36,271
on Mount Gamak,

373
00:33:36,741 --> 00:33:39,581
I swear I saw the woman in white and The Nameless there.

374
00:33:40,111 --> 00:33:41,611
Please take me to the palace.

375
00:33:43,711 --> 00:33:44,781
This letter...

376
00:33:45,151 --> 00:33:46,321
(Letter)

377
00:33:49,491 --> 00:33:51,121
(Secret pact)

378
00:33:53,191 --> 00:33:54,961
(Mount Gamak)

379
00:33:56,731 --> 00:33:58,661
(Mountain fortress, Mount Gamak, Woman in white, letter)

380
00:34:00,861 --> 00:34:01,861
Wait.

381
00:34:03,931 --> 00:34:05,171
The woman in white.

382
00:34:06,341 --> 00:34:07,371
The letter.

383
00:34:09,101 --> 00:34:10,141
The secret pact?

384
00:34:11,071 --> 00:34:13,711
The woman in white, the letter, the secret pact?

385
00:34:14,841 --> 00:34:15,881
This letter...

386
00:34:21,381 --> 00:34:24,591
(Coup, meritorious contributor)

387
00:34:26,591 --> 00:34:28,621
- The secret pact.
- I said move!

388
00:34:28,691 --> 00:34:29,731
You must not, Your Majesty.

389
00:34:30,731 --> 00:34:31,861
Out of my way!

390
00:34:34,261 --> 00:34:35,261
Your Majesty.

391
00:34:57,691 --> 00:35:00,461
- One! Two!
- One!

392
00:35:00,791 --> 00:35:02,221
- Two!
- Three!

393
00:35:03,031 --> 00:35:05,431
At ease! One!

394
00:35:06,101 --> 00:35:07,101
Two!

395
00:35:07,701 --> 00:35:08,701
Three!

396
00:35:15,201 --> 00:35:17,411
The security is very tight there. It is suspicious,

397
00:35:18,341 --> 00:35:19,341
sir.

398
00:35:20,611 --> 00:35:22,611
We should get a closer look.

399
00:35:31,221 --> 00:35:33,661
What on earth are you doing here?

400
00:35:34,161 --> 00:35:36,831
If you stay here, you will be in the crossfire too.

401
00:35:36,931 --> 00:35:39,761
I am already prepared to be incarcerated anyway.

402
00:35:40,161 --> 00:35:43,401
And what is with this tone of yours?

403
00:35:44,971 --> 00:35:46,101
That is...

404
00:35:48,671 --> 00:35:49,811
Well...

405
00:35:50,141 --> 00:35:54,141
I have been around Dal a lot. I guess her speech rubbed off on me.

406
00:35:55,641 --> 00:35:58,211
The Royal Concubine... No, the Crown Princess.

407
00:35:58,551 --> 00:36:00,321
How is she?

408
00:36:04,651 --> 00:36:06,721
I can only pray that she is safe.

409
00:36:07,561 --> 00:36:09,091
There is nothing more I can do.

410
00:36:11,461 --> 00:36:13,401
Then make use of me.

411
00:36:18,771 --> 00:36:21,041
The tragedy of the Crown Prince and Crown Princess...

412
00:36:23,041 --> 00:36:25,441
was all my fault.

413
00:36:27,141 --> 00:36:28,141
Pardon?

414
00:36:29,011 --> 00:36:31,351
What do you mean?

415
00:36:32,351 --> 00:36:35,821
What do you mean by incarceration? And how could it be your fault?

416
00:36:38,251 --> 00:36:39,891
The Gyesa Year Incident...

417
00:36:41,361 --> 00:36:43,631
was the Left State Councillor's revenge.

418
00:36:44,861 --> 00:36:49,261
Revenge for the woman he loved being stolen by the Royal Family.

419
00:36:53,471 --> 00:36:57,271
Revenge for her miserable death.

420
00:36:58,141 --> 00:37:02,611
You are saying that the bloodbath was all for the sake of revenge?

421
00:37:04,281 --> 00:37:05,881
Come to think of it,

422
00:37:07,721 --> 00:37:10,151
for a simple grab for power,

423
00:37:11,591 --> 00:37:14,121
his methods were too elaborate.

424
00:37:15,261 --> 00:37:18,891
He even spread rumours of Queen Jangjeong's ghost.

425
00:37:19,161 --> 00:37:21,031
He used those rumours as a pretext...

426
00:37:21,361 --> 00:37:24,501
to reopen the false adultery case.

427
00:37:25,431 --> 00:37:28,501
The people he killed in the Gyesa Year...

428
00:37:30,641 --> 00:37:31,941
Every last one of them...

429
00:37:32,441 --> 00:37:34,941
was connected to Queen Jangjeong.

430
00:37:37,251 --> 00:37:39,181
The more the Left State Councillor's crimes pile up,

431
00:37:40,281 --> 00:37:42,481
the more my own guilt grows.

432
00:37:44,691 --> 00:37:45,891
I must put a stop to it.

433
00:37:47,191 --> 00:37:50,631
So, if you need anything at all,

434
00:37:51,531 --> 00:37:52,861
just say the word.

435
00:38:00,301 --> 00:38:01,441
I need to see...

436
00:38:02,101 --> 00:38:03,411
Queen Jangjeong for myself.

437
00:38:14,851 --> 00:38:16,191
Wait, so the woman in white...

438
00:38:17,251 --> 00:38:19,461
was really Prince Je Un's mother?

439
00:38:30,801 --> 00:38:31,971
Royal Mother!

440
00:38:32,941 --> 00:38:34,041
Royal Mother!

441
00:38:34,801 --> 00:38:36,001
Mother!

442
00:38:40,211 --> 00:38:41,211
Mother.

443
00:38:50,951 --> 00:38:53,221
- You cannot go now.
- Let go of me.

444
00:38:53,921 --> 00:38:55,961
If you go out there now, you will ruin everything.

445
00:38:57,331 --> 00:38:58,361
I know this is hard for you,

446
00:38:59,031 --> 00:39:00,031
but please...

447
00:39:01,531 --> 00:39:04,901
This should be enough to prove this fortress is an illegal den.

448
00:39:05,371 --> 00:39:07,501
Go to the Capital Garrison Command and request reinforcements.

449
00:39:19,721 --> 00:39:21,651
The Crown Princess Consort asked me to give this to Choraengi Mask.

450
00:39:22,021 --> 00:39:25,691
She said Choraengi Mask has a scar by her mouth, like a fingernail.

451
00:39:32,031 --> 00:39:33,831
You are Choraengi Mask, are you not?

452
00:39:34,301 --> 00:39:36,631
Daughter of Kim Deok Chun and Yun Gye Sim.

453
00:39:45,771 --> 00:39:47,041
This is a letter from the Crown Princess Consort.

454
00:40:06,561 --> 00:40:07,601
My lord.

455
00:40:19,141 --> 00:40:21,311
Your mother died three years ago.

456
00:40:22,211 --> 00:40:23,551
I promise you,

457
00:40:25,111 --> 00:40:26,721
I am going to ruin my father.

458
00:40:28,081 --> 00:40:29,891
So, you need to get away from him.

459
00:40:31,921 --> 00:40:34,121
Do not be tied down to anything anymore.

460
00:40:35,261 --> 00:40:36,491
Go and be free.

461
00:40:39,361 --> 00:40:40,361
Leave.

462
00:40:41,531 --> 00:40:44,631
My mother's life is in the Left State Councillor's hands,

463
00:40:45,031 --> 00:40:46,301
so I am not going anywhere.

464
00:40:47,901 --> 00:40:50,141
Do not disappoint me again.

465
00:40:50,641 --> 00:40:53,781
Your mother deserves to be free, does she not?

466
00:40:56,351 --> 00:40:57,351
Is it true?

467
00:40:59,781 --> 00:41:02,321
I do not know what your relationship with the Crown Princess Consort is,

468
00:41:02,651 --> 00:41:06,321
but to get that letter to you, she took a great many risks.

469
00:41:07,261 --> 00:41:08,561
If you cannot bring yourself to trust us,

470
00:41:09,021 --> 00:41:10,061
then trust Crown Princess Consort.

471
00:41:33,281 --> 00:41:34,281
Tonight,

472
00:41:34,751 --> 00:41:36,921
the forces of The Nameless will march on the capital.

473
00:41:37,821 --> 00:41:40,321
I will help you. You can escape after they have left.

474
00:41:40,621 --> 00:41:41,791
Why are The Nameless going to the capital?

475
00:41:42,261 --> 00:41:44,431
The Royal Wedding is tomorrow.

476
00:41:47,261 --> 00:41:50,331
The Left State Councillor knows you are all on Mount Gamak.

477
00:41:51,001 --> 00:41:52,071
You need to be careful.

478
00:41:52,801 --> 00:41:53,801
Wait.

479
00:41:55,471 --> 00:41:58,641
Do you happen to know anything about a secret pact?

480
00:42:00,741 --> 00:42:02,581
I am not sure it is the secret pact,

481
00:42:04,711 --> 00:42:08,121
but it seems there is something important in those quarters.

482
00:42:08,551 --> 00:42:09,551
And what is that?

483
00:42:10,191 --> 00:42:12,091
Whenever the head of our order gets drunk,

484
00:42:12,851 --> 00:42:14,821
he mentions entrusting a key item to a woman who is not of sound mind,

485
00:42:15,461 --> 00:42:18,691
and says he can never understand the Left State Councillor.

486
00:42:19,161 --> 00:42:20,531
Not of sound mind?

487
00:42:22,901 --> 00:42:24,671
For about 15 years now, I hear.

488
00:42:25,171 --> 00:42:27,101
When she has a rare lucid moment and tries to escape,

489
00:42:27,371 --> 00:42:29,471
I heard she takes that object with her.

490
00:42:34,141 --> 00:42:35,381
My Royal Mother...

491
00:42:36,281 --> 00:42:37,311
But how?

492
00:42:43,251 --> 00:42:45,650
If she is the Left State Councillor's weakness,

493
00:42:45,651 --> 00:42:47,661
he will bring his full force to bear.

494
00:42:48,661 --> 00:42:51,631
Gosh, no. No way.

495
00:42:51,861 --> 00:42:54,531
What if the secret pact is not even there?

496
00:42:58,101 --> 00:42:59,101
No, hold on.

497
00:42:59,741 --> 00:43:00,771
No, that is not it.

498
00:43:01,441 --> 00:43:02,441
Park Dal.

499
00:43:02,801 --> 00:43:04,970
Since when were you so cautious?

500
00:43:04,971 --> 00:43:06,641
A merchant without guts is dead.

501
00:43:07,181 --> 00:43:09,181
Trust me. Trust His Highness.

502
00:43:10,211 --> 00:43:11,281
We charge head-on!

503
00:43:13,651 --> 00:43:15,120
If what Deok Chun said is true,

504
00:43:15,121 --> 00:43:17,821
the secret pact must be with Queen Jangjeong.

505
00:43:18,621 --> 00:43:20,620
I will request reinforcements...

506
00:43:20,621 --> 00:43:22,561
- from the Capital Garrison Command.
- No, you cannot.

507
00:43:22,961 --> 00:43:24,290
If soldiers swarm the place,

508
00:43:24,291 --> 00:43:26,661
we cannot ensure Queen Jangjeong's safety.

509
00:43:27,201 --> 00:43:29,161
Rescuing Her Highness must be our first priority.

510
00:43:30,731 --> 00:43:31,731
Your Highness, the Crown Princess.

511
00:43:33,071 --> 00:43:34,071
Thank you.

512
00:43:35,441 --> 00:43:37,871
I am the one who should thank you for your restraint.

513
00:43:39,541 --> 00:43:40,541
And...

514
00:43:41,481 --> 00:43:43,611
I am afraid I have another difficult favour to ask.

515
00:43:44,981 --> 00:43:46,281
Once we find the secret pact,

516
00:43:46,451 --> 00:43:49,451
can you take it straight to Hanyang?

517
00:43:50,021 --> 00:43:51,891
I cannot leave my mother behind.

518
00:43:52,021 --> 00:43:54,861
Someone has to get the secret pact to His Royal Highness.

519
00:43:55,921 --> 00:43:58,491
Trust me and leave Her Majesty to me.

520
00:44:02,561 --> 00:44:03,571
Okay.

521
00:44:05,071 --> 00:44:07,240
Lord Shin Won, after rescuing Her Majesty,

522
00:44:07,241 --> 00:44:09,271
get reinforcements from the Capital Garrison Command.

523
00:44:09,541 --> 00:44:10,971
I will escort the Grand Prince's mother...

524
00:44:11,011 --> 00:44:13,711
to the Mount Bulgok cabin where we hid before.

525
00:44:14,481 --> 00:44:16,141
After you and your soldiers raid the fortress,

526
00:44:16,481 --> 00:44:18,211
we will meet back at Mount Bulgok.

527
00:44:18,381 --> 00:44:21,281
It is too risky for you to go alone. Let me escort you.

528
00:44:21,481 --> 00:44:23,520
I am a wanted traitor. It is more risky for me...

529
00:44:23,521 --> 00:44:24,651
to go to the Capital Garrison Command with you.

530
00:44:25,151 --> 00:44:27,361
We will use the ferry dock, so do not worry.

531
00:44:27,721 --> 00:44:28,991
Are you sure you will be all right?

532
00:44:29,361 --> 00:44:32,231
You will need more people to leave the ferry dock quickly.

533
00:44:37,701 --> 00:44:40,171
- What are you guys doing here?
- You impossible girl!

534
00:44:41,171 --> 00:44:44,111
Who told you to get involved? Who asked you to rescue us?

535
00:44:44,441 --> 00:44:47,511
You are going to be the death of me! I swear!

536
00:44:49,241 --> 00:44:50,251
Wait...

537
00:44:51,081 --> 00:44:52,811
- How did you even find this place?
- How else?

538
00:44:53,151 --> 00:44:55,021
We forced it out of my round-faced junior eunuch.

539
00:44:55,681 --> 00:44:58,821
And honey, you should speak straight.

540
00:44:59,091 --> 00:45:01,791
Dal is the reason we got to live extra five years and seven days.

541
00:45:01,861 --> 00:45:02,861
For goodness' sake.

542
00:45:03,591 --> 00:45:05,661
Talk about a textbook case of ingratitude.

543
00:45:05,991 --> 00:45:09,731
It is like saving a drowning person and then they ask why you bothered.

544
00:45:10,571 --> 00:45:11,571
What has gotten into her?

545
00:45:12,301 --> 00:45:13,301
One moment.

546
00:45:14,241 --> 00:45:15,801
Let us speak privately.

547
00:45:16,671 --> 00:45:17,671
Alone.

548
00:45:25,251 --> 00:45:26,281
What happened?

549
00:45:28,551 --> 00:45:32,321
- It is just as it looks.
- Do not tell me you switched again.

550
00:45:32,591 --> 00:45:35,191
I did it on purpose. I wanted her safe in the palace.

551
00:45:35,291 --> 00:45:38,031
You mean you can switch bodies at will?

552
00:45:38,631 --> 00:45:39,631
It would seem so.

553
00:45:40,301 --> 00:45:41,301
Then...

554
00:45:42,161 --> 00:45:43,831
you must switch back with Her Highness now.

555
00:45:44,771 --> 00:45:46,571
We will take care of Her Highness.

556
00:45:47,501 --> 00:45:49,301
That is not something I can do on my own.

557
00:45:50,071 --> 00:45:53,481
Besides, even if I could, I would not.

558
00:45:54,011 --> 00:45:56,081
This revenge is for both me...

559
00:45:56,951 --> 00:45:58,081
and for Dal.

560
00:46:01,451 --> 00:46:02,881
And Her Highness? Does she feel the same way?

561
00:46:07,561 --> 00:46:08,561
In that case,

562
00:46:11,231 --> 00:46:12,531
I will help you.

563
00:46:15,331 --> 00:46:16,701
I will do whatever it takes.

564
00:46:49,631 --> 00:46:52,131
I am finished. You may clear the table.

565
00:46:52,531 --> 00:46:54,371
- Yes, Your Royal Highness.
- Yes, Your Royal Highness.

566
00:46:56,271 --> 00:46:59,211
Here, allow me. I will take care of this.

567
00:47:00,081 --> 00:47:01,081
All right.

568
00:47:44,791 --> 00:47:46,121
I need to see the Crown Princess Consort.

569
00:47:46,691 --> 00:47:48,161
Prepare a eunuch's uniform for me.

570
00:48:11,781 --> 00:48:15,121
Thank you for your hard work. His Highness is already asleep.

571
00:48:15,551 --> 00:48:17,021
So why do you not have some of this while you work?

572
00:48:17,391 --> 00:48:21,091
- Go on, have a taste.
- Much appreciated.

573
00:48:26,331 --> 00:48:28,331
Try this too.

574
00:48:35,771 --> 00:48:36,771
Halt!

575
00:48:38,571 --> 00:48:39,571
What is this?

576
00:48:41,781 --> 00:48:45,411
Oh, right. It is just some liquor.

577
00:48:45,951 --> 00:48:46,951
I will have to check it.

578
00:48:54,961 --> 00:48:58,231
Put wet straw and chilli powder in jars and have it ready.

579
00:48:58,291 --> 00:49:00,631
Oh my. It is really spicy, right?

580
00:49:00,701 --> 00:49:02,231
- Here. Wipe it with this.
- Get me anaesthetic powder too.

581
00:49:02,301 --> 00:49:04,631
That is it. There you go.

582
00:49:34,801 --> 00:49:35,801
Gosh!

583
00:49:40,941 --> 00:49:41,941
That hurts.

584
00:51:13,461 --> 00:51:14,601
Who are you?

585
00:51:25,811 --> 00:51:26,881
It is okay, little one.

586
00:51:27,941 --> 00:51:28,941
Do not cry.

587
00:51:33,751 --> 00:51:34,751
Mother.

588
00:51:48,161 --> 00:51:49,201
Royal Mother.

589
00:51:51,701 --> 00:51:53,131
Your son is here.

590
00:51:54,501 --> 00:51:56,001
It is me, Un. I am here.

591
00:52:04,181 --> 00:52:05,211
It is okay, little one.

592
00:52:05,911 --> 00:52:07,051
It is okay. Do not cry.

593
00:52:07,921 --> 00:52:08,951
Mommy is here.

594
00:52:09,921 --> 00:52:10,921
Please!

595
00:52:11,851 --> 00:52:14,691
- My baby!
- Mother! Please!

596
00:52:16,931 --> 00:52:20,191
Please look at me. Not at that pillow!

597
00:52:25,071 --> 00:52:26,971
I am your son.

598
00:52:34,381 --> 00:52:35,381
These eyes,

599
00:52:37,081 --> 00:52:38,081
this nose,

600
00:52:38,851 --> 00:52:39,851
these lips.

601
00:52:41,181 --> 00:52:43,751
From head to toe,

602
00:52:45,251 --> 00:52:47,291
everything was a gift from you, Royal Mother.

603
00:52:48,721 --> 00:52:50,461
I am your son.

604
00:53:14,681 --> 00:53:15,821
Royal Mother.

605
00:53:17,251 --> 00:53:18,251
Crown Prince!

606
00:53:28,661 --> 00:53:29,701
Is that you, Un?

607
00:53:34,171 --> 00:53:35,341
Is it really you, Un?

608
00:53:36,141 --> 00:53:38,511
Yes. It is me, Mother.

609
00:53:41,211 --> 00:53:42,211
My dear Un.

610
00:53:44,781 --> 00:53:45,781
Mother.

611
00:54:13,841 --> 00:54:15,441
How have you been all this time?

612
00:54:17,511 --> 00:54:19,111
Are you feeling all right?

613
00:54:20,851 --> 00:54:23,151
Your Majesty, I apologise,

614
00:54:23,481 --> 00:54:26,751
but did the Left State Councillor leave anything with you?

615
00:54:27,591 --> 00:54:28,591
Like a letter, perhaps.

616
00:54:29,561 --> 00:54:30,561
A letter?

617
00:54:36,001 --> 00:54:37,271
Forgive my intrusion.

618
00:54:37,931 --> 00:54:39,531
I must briefly search the room.

619
00:54:56,321 --> 00:54:57,951
What brings you here?

620
00:54:58,221 --> 00:54:59,851
I have come to discuss a difficult matter.

621
00:55:00,591 --> 00:55:03,491
Grand Prince Je Un has now gone to The Nameless' mountain fortress.

622
00:55:03,791 --> 00:55:06,491
He will probably return with his mother.

623
00:55:08,461 --> 00:55:09,761
When you say his mother,

624
00:55:10,261 --> 00:55:11,971
who are you referring to?

625
00:55:13,741 --> 00:55:15,071
Queen Jangjeong.

626
00:55:16,001 --> 00:55:17,211
Grand Prince Je Un's mother.

627
00:56:13,191 --> 00:56:14,201
So the Gyesa Year Incident...

628
00:56:14,261 --> 00:56:16,331
was revenge for the Grand Prince Un's mother?

629
00:56:19,031 --> 00:56:20,701
To think she was in love with my father...

630
00:56:23,241 --> 00:56:25,371
What a truly ridiculous pairing.

631
00:56:25,871 --> 00:56:27,011
It would seem...

632
00:56:27,241 --> 00:56:28,741
that Queen Jangjeong is...

633
00:56:28,811 --> 00:56:30,381
his weakness.

634
00:56:31,451 --> 00:56:32,551
Which is why...

635
00:56:32,811 --> 00:56:35,551
I think I can call off the Royal Wedding tomorrow.

636
00:56:37,391 --> 00:56:38,491
He will return,

637
00:56:39,621 --> 00:56:44,291
but if Grand Prince Je Un is not back for the Royal Wedding,

638
00:56:44,931 --> 00:56:47,030
I will strike the Left State Councillor...

639
00:56:47,031 --> 00:56:48,131
where he is most vulnerable.

640
00:57:08,121 --> 00:57:10,751
(The Meritorious Subjects)

641
00:57:14,021 --> 00:57:15,091
At last.

642
00:57:23,231 --> 00:57:25,231
- Please take good care of her.
- Yes.

643
00:57:28,101 --> 00:57:29,301
Open it! Break it down!

644
00:57:30,201 --> 00:57:31,411
Open it!

645
00:57:33,941 --> 00:57:35,841
Hurry, people are coming!

646
00:58:48,321 --> 00:58:50,051
- Go!
- Yes, sir!

647
00:59:01,901 --> 00:59:03,331
Mother, are you all right?

648
00:59:07,501 --> 00:59:09,901
- It is the traitors!
- They went that way!

649
00:59:10,811 --> 00:59:13,571
Your Highness, please escort her to the ferry dock.

650
00:59:15,081 --> 00:59:17,181
Mother, I will be right behind you.

651
00:59:18,351 --> 00:59:19,451
This is a secret,

652
00:59:19,711 --> 00:59:21,521
but your son is quite the master fighter.

653
00:59:22,151 --> 00:59:23,221
- No, you cannot.
- Over there!

654
00:59:23,281 --> 00:59:24,651
How can I possibly go alone?

655
00:59:24,991 --> 00:59:27,151
I entrust the Royal Mother to you, Your Highness,

656
00:59:27,251 --> 00:59:28,461
You must go, Your Majesty.

657
00:59:29,021 --> 00:59:30,021
Your Majesty.

658
00:59:38,271 --> 00:59:40,401
Get them! Do not let them get away!

659
00:59:46,111 --> 00:59:47,511
Just so you know, I am furious.

660
00:59:48,441 --> 00:59:49,911
You should be worried about saving your own neck.

661
01:00:48,371 --> 01:00:49,471
This way, please.

662
01:00:56,081 --> 01:00:57,811
- Find them!
- Yes, sir.

663
01:00:57,881 --> 01:00:59,681
I will draw them away. You go on ahead.

664
01:01:00,251 --> 01:01:01,751
It is too dangerous for a woman to deal with them alone.

665
01:01:02,551 --> 01:01:04,751
Technically speaking, I am not really a woman.

666
01:01:06,791 --> 01:01:08,220
If you go a bit further,

667
01:01:08,221 --> 01:01:09,991
you will find a man and two women at the ferry dock.

668
01:01:10,961 --> 01:01:12,661
They will help you, Your Majesty.

669
01:01:13,691 --> 01:01:16,301
- But how can I leave you?
- Think only of your son.

670
01:01:17,401 --> 01:01:19,071
You must not get caught,

671
01:01:19,571 --> 01:01:21,771
and you cannot lose your mind. Do you understand?

672
01:01:42,421 --> 01:01:43,461
There she is!

673
01:01:44,731 --> 01:01:45,731
Get her!

674
01:01:53,101 --> 01:01:54,871
My dear Un...

675
01:02:04,481 --> 01:02:06,710
- That way!
- That way! Get them!

676
01:02:06,711 --> 01:02:07,851
- Yes, sir!
- Yes, sir!

677
01:02:09,151 --> 01:02:10,151
Another unit's soldiers?

678
01:02:12,751 --> 01:02:14,261
There he is! Get him!

679
01:02:15,861 --> 01:02:18,661
They are the Royal Guards. His Majesty must have sent them.

680
01:02:24,331 --> 01:02:25,371
Attack!

681
01:02:32,311 --> 01:02:34,340
We apologise. We got lost on a mountain path...

682
01:02:34,341 --> 01:02:36,381
- and got held up.
- It is all right.

683
01:02:37,411 --> 01:02:40,181
Go to the Capital Garrison Command and bring back reinforcements.

684
01:02:40,381 --> 01:02:41,881
Are we not going to the mountain fortress?

685
01:02:42,081 --> 01:02:45,021
We are outnumbered by The Nameless at the mountain fortress.

686
01:02:45,251 --> 01:02:48,021
And you, go to the Royal Mother at Bulguksa.

687
01:02:48,191 --> 01:02:50,821
I will go to Hanyang and give my brother the secret pact.

688
01:02:52,091 --> 01:02:53,431
I will go with you.

689
01:02:54,161 --> 01:02:55,161
You?

690
01:02:55,301 --> 01:02:56,930
We do not know how many men from The Nameless are...

691
01:02:56,931 --> 01:02:58,601
in Hanyang or on the road.

692
01:02:58,831 --> 01:03:01,271
If I go with you, we can avoid being spotted by The Nameless.

693
01:03:03,401 --> 01:03:04,411
Let us go.

694
01:03:09,111 --> 01:03:10,111
Let us get going.

695
01:03:22,521 --> 01:03:25,661
Tomorrow, in front of the ministers and all your subjects,

696
01:03:26,091 --> 01:03:28,061
if you reveal the truth about the secret pact,

697
01:03:28,901 --> 01:03:29,961
Your Majesty..

698
01:03:30,361 --> 01:03:32,031
Will be seen as staging a coup without just cause,

699
01:03:32,431 --> 01:03:33,901
and you will suffer the consequences.

700
01:03:34,441 --> 01:03:36,371
Furthermore, His Highness...

701
01:03:36,501 --> 01:03:39,741
will not be able to escape guilt by association.

702
01:03:40,271 --> 01:03:42,911
If all we do is worry, we will never change anything.

703
01:03:45,151 --> 01:03:46,581
The best option is already off the table.

704
01:03:47,881 --> 01:03:49,151
All that is left is the lesser of two evils.

705
01:04:14,211 --> 01:04:15,381
When you said strike...

706
01:04:15,881 --> 01:04:17,211
During the Royal Wedding procession,

707
01:04:17,681 --> 01:04:19,051
I will claim I sent troops...

708
01:04:19,581 --> 01:04:21,921
to Mount Gamak to save Queen Jangjeong.

709
01:04:22,021 --> 01:04:23,921
My father will not stand for that.

710
01:04:24,891 --> 01:04:26,520
We do not even know if Grand Prince Je Un is alive.

711
01:04:26,521 --> 01:04:27,691
Exactly.

712
01:04:29,391 --> 01:04:32,131
The Left State Councillor will rush to Queen Jangjeong's side,

713
01:04:32,261 --> 01:04:34,801
and that is when we can go after him with the Royal Guards.

714
01:04:35,101 --> 01:04:36,201
Come with me then.

715
01:04:40,001 --> 01:04:42,401
Are you worried about me?

716
01:04:43,041 --> 01:04:44,471
We are a team now, are we not?

717
01:04:45,441 --> 01:04:47,111
That is what teammates do. They help each other.

718
01:04:47,711 --> 01:04:49,811
If the Left State Councillor falls, you will be arrested too,

719
01:04:50,241 --> 01:04:51,381
and I cannot let that happen.

720
01:04:53,251 --> 01:04:54,821
If, by some slim chance, this goes wrong,

721
01:04:56,421 --> 01:04:57,951
you must go to Grand Prince Je Un anyway.

722
01:05:00,821 --> 01:05:02,220
I will confess to the Sinjusa incident...

723
01:05:02,221 --> 01:05:03,961
to tie my father's hands,

724
01:05:05,861 --> 01:05:07,431
so go and save Grand Prince Je Un.

725
01:05:09,161 --> 01:05:11,201
My father was the one who shattered me.

726
01:05:11,971 --> 01:05:13,231
I have no choice but to pierce him...

727
01:05:14,171 --> 01:05:15,901
with these shattered pieces of me.

728
01:05:19,971 --> 01:05:21,011
He will come.

729
01:05:21,711 --> 01:05:24,611
He said he would, so he will.

730
01:05:25,511 --> 01:05:26,651
And if he does not,

731
01:05:27,451 --> 01:05:28,551
I will just go to him.

732
01:06:39,351 --> 01:06:41,691
The daughter of Left State Councillor Kim Han Chul...

733
01:06:42,491 --> 01:06:44,431
is hereby appointed Crown Princess.

734
01:08:25,691 --> 01:08:28,431
Your Highness, you may alight now.

735
01:08:29,731 --> 01:08:32,231
Oh, okay.

736
01:10:23,481 --> 01:10:24,981
- Your Highness.
- Your Highness.

737
01:10:25,051 --> 01:10:26,481
- Oh, my. Are you all right?
- Your Highness.

738
01:10:26,551 --> 01:10:27,551
- Your Highness.
- Your Highness.

739
01:10:28,121 --> 01:10:29,581
- Your Highness.
- Your Highness.

740
01:10:29,781 --> 01:10:31,350
- What is going on?
- Your Highness.

741
01:10:31,351 --> 01:10:33,221
- Call the Royal Physician!
- Okay!

742
01:10:33,651 --> 01:10:36,361
- Your Highness.
- Your Highness, not again.

743
01:10:36,421 --> 01:10:38,461
- Fetch the Royal Physician!
- Yes, sir.

744
01:10:38,961 --> 01:10:40,031
Open the door.

745
01:10:49,441 --> 01:10:50,741
Remove this headdress.

746
01:10:51,141 --> 01:10:52,941
- Your Highness?
- Now.

747
01:10:54,011 --> 01:10:55,011
Yes, Your Highness.

748
01:10:57,341 --> 01:10:59,151
If, by some slim chance, this goes wrong,

749
01:11:00,151 --> 01:11:01,480
I will confess to the Sinjusa incident...

750
01:11:01,481 --> 01:11:03,351
to tie my father's hands,

751
01:11:04,381 --> 01:11:05,851
so go and save Grand Prince Je Un.

752
01:11:07,791 --> 01:11:09,721
I must put an end to this charade.

753
01:11:11,731 --> 01:11:13,291
Summon the Royal Physician!

754
01:11:14,231 --> 01:11:16,901
- Your Majesty!
- Your Majesty!

755
01:11:17,061 --> 01:11:19,371
Gang!

756
01:11:20,201 --> 01:11:21,271
Summon the Royal Physician!

757
01:11:22,141 --> 01:11:23,341
Get the Royal Physician!

758
01:11:36,451 --> 01:11:37,451
Gang.

759
01:11:40,691 --> 01:11:42,621
Your Highness, are you all right?

760
01:11:43,161 --> 01:11:44,291
Are you all right?

761
01:12:34,571 --> 01:12:35,741
You must go now.

762
01:12:57,461 --> 01:12:58,731
The mountain fortress is surrounded.

763
01:12:59,071 --> 01:13:01,131
- Find their leader!
- Yes, sir!

764
01:13:12,911 --> 01:13:14,011
Your Majesty!

765
01:13:16,581 --> 01:13:18,421
The killer of the former King, the Crown Prince,

766
01:13:19,191 --> 01:13:20,791
as well as the Queen Dowager in the Gyesa Year,

767
01:13:22,721 --> 01:13:24,891
is the traitor Kim Han Chul. Please order his arrest!

768
01:13:39,671 --> 01:13:41,041
What in the world?

769
01:13:59,231 --> 01:14:04,161
(Moon River)

770
01:14:19,281 --> 01:14:20,980
Arrest the traitor!

771
01:14:20,981 --> 01:14:22,881
Left State Councillor, your era is over!

772
01:14:23,751 --> 01:14:25,551
Did you see Dal at the mountain fortress?

773
01:14:25,751 --> 01:14:27,321
There was no one inside her quarters.

774
01:14:27,651 --> 01:14:31,421
Withdraw for now. My plan will not be your undoing.

775
01:14:31,631 --> 01:14:32,730
Let us go.

776
01:14:32,731 --> 01:14:34,591
The Left Councillor has broken through the Souimun Gate.

777
01:14:34,791 --> 01:14:36,901
There is no time. I have to find Dal.

778
01:14:37,261 --> 01:14:40,471
Do you intend to go down with me?

779
01:14:52,311 --> 01:14:53,311
What was that?

780
01:14:56,151 --> 01:14:57,481
We are leaving through the back gate.

781
01:14:58,021 --> 01:14:59,251
What?
