1
00:00:34,667 --> 00:00:35,667
Let's go.

2
00:01:33,667 --> 00:01:35,542
Hey.

3
00:01:35,875 --> 00:01:37,000
What happened?

4
00:01:37,458 --> 00:01:41,333
Found this morning at home.

5
00:01:43,167 --> 00:01:44,958
Go and bow first.

6
00:03:03,542 --> 00:03:05,083
Would you like something to eat?

7
00:03:06,792 --> 00:03:08,500
No, I'm fine.

8
00:03:15,708 --> 00:03:17,125
Is there no chief mourner?

9
00:03:17,208 --> 00:03:18,333
I don't know.

10
00:03:18,333 --> 00:03:20,500
He doesn't have a father
and he's the only son.

11
00:03:21,125 --> 00:03:22,250
What about his mother?

12
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:33,417
What on earth is this every year?

13
00:03:33,750 --> 00:03:35,375
I feel fucking upset...

14
00:03:36,583 --> 00:03:37,833
Why did he do that?

15
00:03:38,333 --> 00:03:40,292
How do I know?

16
00:03:40,292 --> 00:03:42,042
Maybe he had a depression or something.

17
00:03:42,917 --> 00:03:44,417
He didn't seem to
have that kind of thing.

18
00:03:45,292 --> 00:03:47,125
We didn't know him that much.

19
00:03:47,583 --> 00:03:48,500
Right,

20
00:03:51,208 --> 00:03:54,833
some seniors said he was kind of weird.

21
00:03:58,583 --> 00:03:59,875
Hey guys, it's been quite a long time.

22
00:04:00,792 --> 00:04:01,917
How are you guys?

23
00:04:01,917 --> 00:04:03,708
Well, you know...

24
00:04:03,708 --> 00:04:06,083
What are you guys doing these days?
Lectures begin soon, right?

25
00:04:10,292 --> 00:04:11,167
I am tutoring a high school senior girl,

26
00:04:11,167 --> 00:04:12,500
and she is saying
she wants to attend my university.

27
00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:14,125
Quite pretty.

28
00:04:15,125 --> 00:04:17,625
Would you like me
to introduce her to you?

29
00:04:19,750 --> 00:04:20,833
Hey!

30
00:04:22,333 --> 00:04:23,542
Hey!

31
00:04:41,167 --> 00:04:42,500
What the hell...

32
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,417
What on the earth...?

33
00:04:47,333 --> 00:04:49,833
I should have been good to him...

34
00:04:50,792 --> 00:04:53,208
I should have cared more about him...

35
00:04:54,667 --> 00:04:55,500
Hey!

36
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:59,208
What is this mood?
Ok, let me refresh here.

37
00:05:00,917 --> 00:05:03,167
I am learning hypnotism recently.

38
00:05:03,292 --> 00:05:04,583
Guys, look at me.

39
00:05:05,917 --> 00:05:07,667
Look at me, everyone.

40
00:05:09,792 --> 00:05:11,333
Look at my eyes carefully.

41
00:05:11,333 --> 00:05:14,000
And, draw a screen before your eyes.

42
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,042
A screen?

43
00:05:15,042 --> 00:05:18,792
Yes.
And then, draw a figure in that screen.

44
00:05:18,792 --> 00:05:22,208
Any figure is fine. But, no square.

45
00:05:23,917 --> 00:05:27,000
Give it a try, except a square.

46
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:30,292
Are you kidding me?

47
00:05:30,792 --> 00:05:34,000
Just give it a try,
it will make you feel better.

48
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,792
Make me feel better?

49
00:05:36,792 --> 00:05:41,708
Do you feel better even
when your senior ended up like that?

50
00:05:41,708 --> 00:05:43,917
Hey, stop it.

51
00:05:45,917 --> 00:05:47,000
Do it to me.

52
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:49,542
So?

53
00:05:50,583 --> 00:05:52,542
I drew a figure, And then?

54
00:06:13,750 --> 00:06:16,708
Hey, why did you break
that incense at that moment?

55
00:06:17,250 --> 00:06:22,042
No idea, that thing just broke.

56
00:06:23,375 --> 00:06:25,250
Oh my goodness, Yun-il.

57
00:06:41,958 --> 00:06:43,542
Feel really weird.

58
00:06:45,667 --> 00:06:48,958
I know, he's gone now.

59
00:06:53,083 --> 00:06:55,375
Feel like he's there at school.

60
00:06:56,625 --> 00:06:58,750
Let's go get some food.

61
00:07:06,750 --> 00:07:08,250
What did he say a while ago?

62
00:07:10,375 --> 00:07:11,458
Kim Hyun-jin.

63
00:07:12,292 --> 00:07:13,375
Ah,

64
00:07:15,542 --> 00:07:18,417
he guessed right on
what I thought in mind.

65
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,208
Guessed what?

66
00:07:20,208 --> 00:07:21,375
You know,

67
00:07:22,708 --> 00:07:24,625
I thought a round and a triangle in mind

68
00:07:26,042 --> 00:07:28,917
and he guessed correctly what I thought.

69
00:07:31,042 --> 00:07:33,458
I thought he was putting a spell on you.

70
00:07:34,333 --> 00:07:35,750
What do you mean?

71
00:07:38,750 --> 00:07:41,458
He was staring at you
and it was really freaky.

72
00:07:46,833 --> 00:07:50,875
Why did you take his shit?

73
00:07:52,125 --> 00:07:53,542
Just because.

74
00:07:55,792 --> 00:07:58,750
He does that once in a while,
not getting the point.

75
00:07:58,750 --> 00:08:01,750
He didn't seem not to get the point.

76
00:08:01,750 --> 00:08:05,250
Then what the hell is all the lesson,
a girl,

77
00:08:06,375 --> 00:08:07,792
and the hypnotism thing?

78
00:08:10,833 --> 00:08:12,458
He didn't do it out of spite though.

79
00:08:18,667 --> 00:08:20,417
People get confused.

80
00:08:20,833 --> 00:08:23,125
People like In-chul do.

81
00:08:25,125 --> 00:08:28,625
I get confused sometimes
when he is around.

82
00:08:31,542 --> 00:08:33,083
What do you think?

83
00:08:46,917 --> 00:08:48,083
Let's go.

84
00:10:07,458 --> 00:10:08,625
He's here.

85
00:10:14,083 --> 00:10:15,292
He's been there until now?

86
00:10:15,292 --> 00:10:17,208
Yes, the professors came.

87
00:10:17,208 --> 00:10:18,667
Guess we got out too soon.

88
00:10:18,667 --> 00:10:19,667
No, no.

89
00:10:19,667 --> 00:10:20,958
Hey, that's not the point.

90
00:10:20,958 --> 00:10:21,917
Listen to me here.

91
00:10:23,375 --> 00:10:27,625
Did you guys know that
Lim sung-gyu and Kim Hyun-jin,

92
00:10:28,333 --> 00:10:29,417
Fuck,

93
00:10:31,875 --> 00:10:35,333
did you see that he had two rings
on his hand?

94
00:10:35,333 --> 00:10:38,708
One is his and the other
one belonged to the senior.

95
00:10:38,708 --> 00:10:40,167
Isn't that a jackpot?

96
00:10:40,750 --> 00:10:42,583
Are you serious?　-Hey, I am serious.

97
00:10:42,583 --> 00:10:48,083
You know,
I googled it and these kinds of tribes

98
00:10:48,083 --> 00:10:50,125
make the intercourse through anus.

99
00:10:50,125 --> 00:10:51,208
What the fuck?

100
00:10:51,208 --> 00:10:53,125
Look at this chopstick stabbing
this meat.

101
00:10:55,750 --> 00:11:01,250
Then this chopstick is top,
the meat is bottom.

102
00:11:01,833 --> 00:11:04,208
Just eat, you moron.

103
00:11:04,208 --> 00:11:09,875
Listen,
they call it splitting a gourd in half.

104
00:11:09,875 --> 00:11:12,125
So, If I say, hey friend,

105
00:11:12,125 --> 00:11:14,292
shall we go split a gourd in half?

106
00:11:14,292 --> 00:11:15,917
Fuck off, you idiot.

107
00:11:15,917 --> 00:11:18,250
You know, then you are the top
and I am the bottom?

108
00:11:18,250 --> 00:11:19,458
No no, I am the top.

109
00:11:19,458 --> 00:11:21,458
Which do you want? Neither, you freak.

110
00:11:21,458 --> 00:11:25,292
In the world, only you and I left.

111
00:11:25,292 --> 00:11:28,042
Then do you want the top or bottom?

112
00:11:30,875 --> 00:11:32,167
Fuck you!

113
00:11:32,583 --> 00:11:34,667
Fuck you! Asshole!

114
00:12:51,708 --> 00:12:53,250
What happened with your face?

115
00:12:56,917 --> 00:12:58,167
I have salve.

116
00:12:59,250 --> 00:13:00,542
Did you eat something?

117
00:13:06,667 --> 00:13:08,208
You should.

118
00:13:11,167 --> 00:13:12,417
Let's eat some,

119
00:13:13,708 --> 00:13:15,583
I will be with you.

120
00:14:03,625 --> 00:14:10,167
I WILL BE WITH YOU
