00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
The King of Blaze

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Episode 16

3
00:00:15,400 --> 00:00:16,240
Sister Zha,

4
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:19,840
you know about the medical resources on our island.

5
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:22,360
Xiaoxiao is badly injured.

6
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:25,360
I want to send her to the east gang for treatment.

7
00:00:27,160 --> 00:00:29,200
It's useless to beg me for this.

8
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Go down.

9
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:46,160
If you want to get out,

10
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:48,960
you have to use this to talk.

11
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:55,040
If the 20 million didn't happen,

12
00:00:55,720 --> 00:00:57,360
you might still have a chance.

13
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:03,160
But Wang Jincheng is awake now.

14
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:09,240
Go down a little.

15
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:26,160
Sister Zha,

16
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:29,480
you don't have to worry about Wang Jincheng.

17
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:31,960
Even if he wakes up,

18
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:35,080
I can still make him buy more.

19
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:38,920
But it's troublesome for the police.

20
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:41,120
It's easy to get caught

21
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:42,880
if you use a bank card.

22
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:52,480
You know the news quite well.

23
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:01,560
Go.

24
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:12,880
Use gold to replace cash.

25
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:15,880
Use the cash from the domestic water supply

26
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:17,920
to avoid the police's stop.

27
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:21,840
I've tried this method for three months.

28
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:23,680
I can't fail.

29
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:27,040
I don't know how much

30
00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:29,560
I can do compared to my brother.

31
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:33,160
Can you count as a big thing?

32
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:39,040
I helped you and your sister.

33
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:41,520
How should you repay me?

34
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:46,320
I know what you mean.

35
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:50,040
But can you

36
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:52,120
let me finish this first

37
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:55,120
and send my sister out?

38
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:58,280
Otherwise, I'll always miss you.

39
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,080
Sister Zha, you said it.

40
00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:18,160
Dongge,

41
00:03:18,920 --> 00:03:21,440
do you know that Sister Zha is testing gold fraud?

42
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:23,000
What's up?

43
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:24,920
When we were eating,

44
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:27,440
I heard that Shisan got gold fraud

45
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:29,160
from Sister Zha.

46
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:31,520
She's about to cheat her 20 million yuan again.

47
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:35,200
Uncle Buddha has always been kind to her.

48
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,560
If she really succeeds,

49
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:40,840
she'll be so angry that we'll run away.

50
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:41,880
Dongge,

51
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:43,960
how about we kill Shisan first?

52
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:45,080
Kill him.

53
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:30,200
One year ago

54
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:57,000
Excuse me.

55
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:57,840
Okay.

56
00:04:58,480 --> 00:04:59,240
What's the matter?

57
00:04:59,640 --> 00:05:00,640
Don't rush.

58
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:01,240
Take your time.

59
00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:03,360
Officer An.

60
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:04,160
Mr. Wang.

61
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:06,160
Didn't you say

62
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:07,360
the person last time

63
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:08,680
might contact me again?

64
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:11,160
You're right.

65
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:12,280
He called me.

66
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:20,040
This video software

67
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:21,160
can't be recorded.

68
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:23,680
I'm so smart.

69
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:24,760
I used another phone

70
00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:25,800
to record it.

71
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:27,760
Mr. Wang.

72
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:29,600
I'm from Jianghai Police Department.

73
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
My colleague

74
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,080
contacted you before.

75
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:33,880
I think he's in trouble.

76
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:34,400
Yes.

77
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:35,600
Who is he?

78
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:38,440
You ask me.

79
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:39,960
I...

80
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:42,080
Isn't he

81
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:43,720
your colleague?

82
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:47,560
I mean,

83
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:48,600
he's so stupid

84
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:49,600
that he knows what he's doing.

85
00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:51,160
He wants me to pay for it.

86
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:52,480
But he didn't.

87
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:54,240
I just found an excuse

88
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:56,040
to tell him to talk to me tomorrow.

89
00:05:57,680 --> 00:05:58,200
Hello?

90
00:05:58,960 --> 00:05:59,480
Look.

91
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:01,040
The video is here.

92
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:01,600
Look.

93
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:02,320
It's him.

94
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:03,360
Mr. Wang, don't answer it.

95
00:06:05,320 --> 00:06:05,920
You two

96
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:06,800
clean up the meeting room.

97
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:07,880
Don't let them see this police.

98
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:08,400
Go.

99
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:08,960
Okay.

100
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:15,760
Mr. Wang.

101
00:06:15,760 --> 00:06:16,640
Take a rest here.

102
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:17,400
We'll get ready.

103
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:27,640
Hello?

104
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:30,320
Hello?

105
00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:33,560
I'm a police colleague.

106
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:35,000
Why

107
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:36,920
did they change their staff?

108
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:38,720
I've been thinking about it all night.

109
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:39,600
I don't understand.

110
00:06:40,320 --> 00:06:41,600
I'm not thinking about it.

111
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:43,200
Tell me.

112
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:44,960
Is your colleague

113
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:45,880
gone?

114
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:46,960
How can you talk?

115
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:48,440
I'm just...

116
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:49,120
Look.

117
00:06:49,760 --> 00:06:51,080
What should we do?

118
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:53,280
Captain Han must be fine.

119
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:54,160
Don't talk nonsense.

120
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:55,520
Let's get busy.

121
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:57,520
All right.

122
00:06:58,880 --> 00:06:59,960
Tell him to tellamp.

123
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:01,600
I'm going to introduce him to details.

124
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:02,240
I'm sorry.

125
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:21,360
Hello.

126
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:22,640
Hello, Mr. Wang.

127
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:24,560
I contacted you last night.

128
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:26,640
Last time, because the illegal members

129
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:27,680
have damaged the accounts,

130
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:29,920
your account has not been paid in time.

131
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:30,840
So you've been

132
00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:32,640
on our list of people who are in danger.

133
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:33,680
There's a meeting here.

134
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:35,080
In order to prevent illegal members from

135
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:35,880
continuing to drill holes,

136
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:38,240
you can use the way of gold directly.

137
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:41,800
Next, you will receive a message.

138
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:47,800
Captain Han.

139
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:50,920
Why isn't it Captain Han this time?

140
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:53,200
I was told by the real Wang Jincheng.

141
00:07:55,720 --> 00:07:56,520
This guy

142
00:07:56,640 --> 00:07:58,520
can find Wang Jincheng so quickly and accurately.

143
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:00,360
And he mentioned the gold fraud.

144
00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:01,840
It must be Han Chuan

145
00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:03,520
who got the news about our ship.

146
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:09,480
You can report to Wu Ju.

147
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:10,280
Prepare for the next operation.

148
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:10,920
Understood.

149
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:18,280
Mr. Wang, I'm really sorry.

150
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:19,680
I was a little too aggressive just now.

151
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:20,800
Don't take it to heart.

152
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:22,600
It's okay.

153
00:08:22,840 --> 00:08:24,920
I understand.

154
00:08:25,320 --> 00:08:27,320
You're worried about your comrades.

155
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:28,200
It's my fault.

156
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:29,360
I didn't tell you.

157
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:31,760
Don't take it to heart.

158
00:08:34,520 --> 00:08:36,240
I'll leave now.

159
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:38,600
Contact me if you need anything.

160
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:39,720
Okay, Mr. Wang.

161
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:54,160
My hand is broken.

162
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:55,040
I'm really sorry.

163
00:08:55,740 --> 00:08:56,500
Sorry.

164
00:08:57,240 --> 00:08:57,840
That...

165
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:03,280
Look at this.

166
00:09:03,280 --> 00:09:04,320
Just a little more.

167
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:17,600
Good morning.

168
00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:21,960
I feel pretty fine.

169
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:22,800
I'm sorry.

170
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:32,240
Director Wu,

171
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:33,720
we've sent the gold props

172
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:34,840
to the Wangjin family.

173
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:36,160
We're waiting for them to hook up.

174
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:36,960
Okay.

175
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:38,000
Keep an eye on them.

176
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:39,440
If there's anything, just let me know.

177
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:53,520
Hello.

178
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:54,680
This way, please.

179
00:09:54,840 --> 00:09:55,360
Hello.

180
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:01,000
Mr. Wang,

181
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:02,160
we've checked the gold.

182
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:02,920
It's fine.

183
00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:04,560
You need to sign a document.

184
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:05,960
Both documents.

185
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:06,960
Okay.

186
00:10:20,520 --> 00:10:21,760
Mr. Wang, don't worry.

187
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:23,800
We've checked your company.

188
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:25,480
There's no leak.

189
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:27,480
We'll return the gold to you immediately.

190
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:28,880
Thank you.

191
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:34,200
Okay.

192
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:35,120
Goodbye.

193
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:35,880
Oh.

194
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:51,200
Do you think Wang Jincheng

195
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:52,160

196
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:54,800
Last time, he was obvious please her.

197
00:10:55,880 --> 00:10:58,080
And then she trusted him again.

198
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,600
He can be a rich man.

199
00:11:01,280 --> 00:11:02,360
But he didn't tell nonsense.

200
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:03,880

00:11:05,640 --> 00:11:06,840
Even dogs can't fool her

00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:08,360
in the capital.

204
00:11:10,280 --> 00:11:11,320

00:12:49,520 --> 00:12:52,480
Mr. Fang's been shot before he went into the room.

238
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:54,240
He was already dead ages ago.

239

00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:01,120

250
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:11,240
Uncle He

251
00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:13,240
Uncle He

252
00:13:13,240 --> 00:13:14,240
Uncle He

253
00:13:15,840 --> 00:13:17,840
Uncle He, Sister Zha

254
00:13:18,940 --> 00:13:21,840
Sister Zha's method of gold laundering is so powerful

255
00:13:21,840 --> 00:13:23,340
I tried it

256
00:13:23,340 --> 00:13:26,340
and earned 20 million gold in one day

257
00:13:26,340 --> 00:13:30,540
I think we can use it officially

258
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:33,240
Sister Zha

259
00:13:34,640 --> 00:13:35,840
What do you mean?

260
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:38,240
Do you know how much trouble you have made?

261
00:13:38,640 --> 00:13:41,440
Uncle He, I'm doing business for the company

262
00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:47,340
There are three water houses in the country

263
00:13:47,340 --> 00:13:50,940
The police took all the work you did

264
00:13:51,840 --> 00:13:52,840
Are you satisfied?

265
00:13:59,540 --> 00:14:02,840
Uncle He, there's a spy among us

266
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:15,040
In the mist, the unidentified boat

267
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:21,040
knows where to go and where to go

268
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:27,840
The light fades, the night color is flickering

269
00:15:27,840 --> 00:15:35,040
Lighting up the whole journey

270
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:42,040
The clouds are interlocking in the wind and waves

271
00:15:42,040 --> 00:15:49,040
Floating in the dust

272
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:56,040
The balance of the waves, the whirling of the waves

273
00:15:56,040 --> 00:16:05,040
The light never fades
