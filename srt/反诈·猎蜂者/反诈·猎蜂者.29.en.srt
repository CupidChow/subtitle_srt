00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,400
Mmm that was all fun and I'm glad you loved it!

2
00:00:15,400 --> 00:00:17,400
I'm gonna be a good boy.

3
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:19,400
I'm gonna be a good boy.

00:00:19,400 --> 00:00:21,400
I'm gonna be a good boy.

00:00:21,400 --> 00:00:23,400
I'm gonna be a good boy.

6
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:25,400
I'm gonna be a good boy.

7
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:27,400
I'm gonna be a good boy.

8
00:00:27,400 --> 00:00:29,400
I'm gonna be a good boy.

9
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:31,400
I'm gonna be a good boy.

10
00:00:31,400 --> 00:00:33,400
I'm gonna be a good boy.

11
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:35,400
I'm gonna be a good boy.

12
00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:37,400
I'm gonna be a good boy.

13
00:00:37,400 --> 00:00:39,400
I'm gonna be a good boy.

00:00:39,400 --> 00:00:41,400
I'm gonna be a good boy.

15
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:43,400
I'm gonna be a good boy.

16
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:46,400
Episode 07

17
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:53,400
You keep bullying me.

18
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:55,400
Fine. I can't live.

19
00:00:55,400 --> 00:00:57,400
Let's die together.

20
00:00:57,400 --> 00:00:58,400
Let's die together.

21
00:00:58,400 --> 00:00:59,400
Ah-Zi!

22
00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:02,400
Wait.

23
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:11,400
Don't move.

24
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:14,400
Don't move.

25
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:20,400
Zhang Jiahe.

26
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:23,400
Do you know him?

27
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:27,400
Isn't this Xiao Sang?

28
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:29,400
You know him.

29
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:31,400
Why are you asking me?

30
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:33,400
Of course I know him.

31
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:35,400
His name is Sang Tuo.

32
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:38,400
He is the mastermind behind this fraud case.

33
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:40,400
Impossible.

34
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:42,400
He told me.

35
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:44,400
He was framed.

36
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:45,400
Did he look for you before you came here?

37
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:46,400
You know it.

38
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:53,400
I know you must have had a hard time finding a child all these years.

39
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:56,400
I understand your feelings now.

40
00:01:57,400 --> 00:01:59,400
Everything you do now is not what you want, right?

41
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:01,400
You were used by him.

42
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:04,400
Stop pretending.

43
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:07,400
You called us to threaten us.

44
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:09,400
That's not what we said.

45
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:10,400
What video?

46
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:11,400
Yes, it's you.

47
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:12,400
That's all Sang Tuo's lie.

48
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:14,400
He used an AI software to change my face into a fake video.

49
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:16,400
I was in the police every day.

50
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:18,400
I didn't show you any video.

51
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:20,400
If you don't believe me, I can show you the video.

52
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:23,400
You said Sang Tuo was framed.

53
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:25,400
Let me tell you.

54
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:29,400
We have solid evidence to prove that he was wanted.

55
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:31,400
We won't frame a good person.

56
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:32,400
We won't let a bad person go.

57
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:35,400
If you don't believe me, I can show you the video.

58
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:39,400
No.

59
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:41,400
No.

60
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:44,400
If you were a good person, why would he use your face?

61
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:46,400
Okay.

62
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:49,400
I'll tell you why he used your face.

63
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:07,400
Sang Tuo is the owner of a fraud group.

64
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:10,400
I'm his spy.

65
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:13,400
He left me with the wounds.

66
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:18,400
A month ago, the police took away his fraud spot.

67
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:20,400
He was badly hurt.

68
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:22,400
He wanted to kill me.

69
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:24,400
But he didn't dare.

70
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:26,400
So he lied to you.

71
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:29,400
Zheng Jiahao.

72
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:33,400
I believe one day Chenchen will come back to you.

73
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:37,400
We will help you.

74
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:40,400
What if you kill him today?

75
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:42,400
What will Chenchen do?

76
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:45,400
He's back.

77
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:47,400
His father is a murderer.

78
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:49,400
Will he be isolated and discriminated against in school?

79
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:53,400
Will he be disturbed by the life of a murderer's father?

80
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:56,400
Have you ever thought about these things for him?

81
00:03:57,400 --> 00:04:00,400
Don't be a murderer for your own stupidity.

82
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:02,400
Think about your child and Chenchen.

83
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:04,400
He's back.

84
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:05,400
He's back.

85
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:07,400
His mother is gone.

86
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:08,400
His father is in prison.

87
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:09,400
Where should he go?

88
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:10,400
Where is his home?

89
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:14,400
You waited for him for so many years.

90
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:16,400
You just wanted him to go home.

91
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:20,400
Look at your children.

92
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:23,400
Their parents are just like you.

93
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:26,400
They are just waiting for their child to go home safely.

94
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:27,400
Dad.

95
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:34,400
I don't know who told you the truth.

96
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:37,400
Who told you the lie?

97
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:41,400
You are all lying.

98
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:46,400
You are all lying.

99
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:51,400
You are all lying.

100
00:04:57,400 --> 00:04:58,400
Take the hostage out first.

101
00:04:58,400 --> 00:04:59,400
Hurry up.

102
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:00,400
Children, follow me.

103
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:08,400
It must be him.

104
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:10,400
Chief Han.

105
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:11,400
Chief Han.

106
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:12,400
Don't move.

107
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:17,400
Chief Han.

108
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:18,400
He's here.

109
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:20,400

110
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:27,400

121
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:21,400
You are alive.

122
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:23,400
Hold me up.

123
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:27,400

124
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:57,400

Let go if you want to die!

196
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:25,480
I've had enough of this.

197
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:27,480
I'll pay you back.

198
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:29,480
I'll pay you back this time.

199
00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:28,480
Song Tou, if you want to kill me, come at me.

200
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:31,480
I don't dare to hurt so many innocent people.

201
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:33,480
Brother,

202
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:37,480
Ji Zha is just as good as he is.

203
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:42,480
I'm not afraid of you.

204
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:44,480
I'm not afraid of you.

205
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:46,480
I'm not afraid of you.

206
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:48,480
I'm not afraid of you.

207
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:50,480
I'm not afraid of you.

208
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:52,480
I'm not afraid of you.

209
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:56,480
You ruined everything that I truly loved.

210
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:00,480
I want to ruin you too.

211
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:14,480
I was thinking,

212
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:19,480
if I had taken another car that day,

213
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:23,480
would we not have known each other?

214
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:31,480
Master! Brother!

215
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:32,480
Yao Yong! Yao Bo!

216
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:34,480
Song Tou, I don't take you as my biological brother.

217
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:36,480
I said I would save you.

218
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:38,480
But I don't want you to be a leader

219
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:41,480
and you have to be a few years older than others.

220
00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:43,480
Ji Zha,

221
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:48,480
you have no chance.

222
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:13,480
Brother,

223
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:15,480
I'm sorry.

224
00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:19,480
I don't want to be a leader either.

225
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:44,480
Song Tou, don't!

226
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:46,480
