Music

00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
I'm not sure if I'm gonna make it.

00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
I'm not sure if I'm gonna make it.

I'm not sure if I'm gonna make it.

6
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
I'm not sure if I'm gonna make it.

7
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
I'm not sure if I'm gonna make it.

8
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
I'm not sure if I'm gonna make it.

9
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
I'm not sure if I'm gonna make it.

10
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
I'm not sure if I'm gonna make it.

11
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
I'm not sure if I'm gonna make it.

12
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
I'm not sure if I'm gonna make it.

13
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
I'm not sure if I'm gonna make it.

I'm not sure if I'm gonna make it.

I'm not sure if I'm gonna make it.

17
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
I'm not sure if I'm gonna make it.

18
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
I'm not sure if I'm gonna make it.

19
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Hey

20
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Hey, boss Wang

21
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Hey, boss Wang

22
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,820
Love us...

23
00:01:44,420 --> 00:01:46,960
...

24
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Yeah.

25
00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:00,400
I told you, if you get the 20 million,

26
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:01,800
you'll get a million.

27
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:04,800
Brother, I'm begging you.

28
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:06,000
Don't be embarrassed.

29
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Call your parents and borrow some more.

30
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,400
They will take care of you.

31
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:10,400
The money is taken.

32
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:11,600
You can take it.

33
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:12,600
Come here!

34
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:13,600
Help!

35
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:15,000
Come here!

36
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,600
I told you to come here!

37
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:19,600
You're a coward. Come here!

38
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:21,400
You're a coward!

39
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
You're a coward.

40
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,000
You're a coward!

41
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,800
You're a coward!

42
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:27,800
You're a coward!

43
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:28,800
You're a coward!

44
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:30,800
You're a coward!

45
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:32,800
Xiao Xiao!

46
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:34,800
Xiao Xiao!

47
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:36,800
Stop hitting me!

48
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:38,800
I told you to come here!

49
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:40,800
You're a coward!

50
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:41,800
Stop hitting me!

51
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:43,800
You're a coward!

52
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:45,800
Stop hitting me!

53
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:47,800
You're a coward!

54
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:54,800
Xiao Xiao, I'm at the East Bank Airport.

55
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:57,800
What's going on these days?

56
00:02:57,800 --> 00:02:59,600
You asked me to attend the graduation ceremony.

57
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:01,800
You didn't answer my calls and you didn't reply to my messages.

58
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:03,800
I'm coming to the school to find you.

59
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:09,800
This is it, right?

60
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:15,000
Sir, go, go, go!

61
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,800
What go? I'm the one who goes first.

62
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:18,800
Get out of the way!

63
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:20,800
Get out of the way!

64
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:22,800
Stop running!

65
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:24,800
Get out of the way!

66
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:28,800
Sir, faster!

67
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:30,800
Stop running!

68
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:32,800
Hurry up!

69
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:38,800
Stop running!

70
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:42,800
Hurry up!

71
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:44,800
Stop running!

72
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:57,800
Stop running!

73
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:02,800
My bag!

74
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:04,800
Don't worry about the bag. Hurry up and go!

75
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:06,800
This way, this way!

76
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:08,800
Hurry up! You go that way!

77
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:10,800
The rest of you follow me!

78
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:14,800
Stop!

79
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:27,800
Hurry up!

80
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:42,800
You go this way.

81
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:54,800
Boss, your muscles are really strong!

82
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:58,800
Do you want to see the clothes? Our clothes are even brighter!

83
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:03,800
Look at this one. It suits you.

84
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:16,800
There are two men. One is wearing a special color jacket.

85
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:20,800
Do you know how to make a horse's trotter? Have you seen it before?

86
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:22,800
I haven't seen it.

87
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:24,800
Do you like it?

88
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:26,800
I like it. I'll give it to you.

89
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:28,800
Go and see it.

90
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:36,800
It's really strong.

91
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:41,800
Don't do this again. You almost got me killed.

92
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:44,800
Wasn't it urgent earlier?

93
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:47,800
Brother, where are you going? I'll give you a ride. Let's make friends.

94
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:49,800
Introduce yourself. My name is Sang Tuo.

95
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:52,800
I have something to do. I'll go now. See you later.

96
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:53,800
Hey!

97
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:56,800
It's really tough to make friends.

98
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:58,800
He's missing!

99
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:00,800
He's not missing. He's just not in touch for now.

100
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:04,800
Mr. Han, don't worry. We'll try our best to contact him.

101
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:06,800
This is the safest city in the East.

102
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:09,800
If you don't contact him, he'll be missing.

103
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:11,800
When did you last see Xiao Xiao?

104
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:14,800
About two days ago.

105
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:16,800
Two days ago?

106
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:20,800
Why didn't you contact our family when you were missing? Did you call the police?

107
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:24,800
Mr. Han, our school has warned every student

108
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:26,800
to take care of their health when they're out.

109
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:30,800
Everything that happens outside the school has nothing to do with this school.

110
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:33,800
Mr. Han, the school graduation ceremony is about to start. Let's talk next time.

111
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:35,800
Hey, teacher!

112
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:37,800
How many days have you been missing?

113
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:39,800
Two days. Two days ago.

114
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:41,800
It's only two days. What time is it?

115
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:43,800
You can only get a divorce if you can't contact him for five days.

116
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:45,800
Five days? You can only get a divorce after five days?

117
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:46,800
Are you Chinese?

118
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:47,800
Yes.

119
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:50,800
Give me your ID. I'll help you register.

120
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:54,800
I lost my ID. Can you help me?

121
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:56,800
You lost it?

122
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:00,800
Yes.

123
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:02,800
Then wait a moment.

124
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:04,800
Okay.

125
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:08,800
Hey!

126
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:10,800
What are you doing?

127
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:12,800
Why are you helping me?

128
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:14,800
Why are you so rude?

129
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:17,800
I'm sorry.

130
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:24,800
Stop!

131
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:48,800
I'm sorry.

132
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:17,800
I'm sorry.

133
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:47,800
Are you going to the airport?

134
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:49,800
Get on board.

135
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:17,800
I'm sorry.

136
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:32,800
Room four.

137
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:47,800
Room four.

138
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:17,800
Come in!

139
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:30,800
Who are you?

140
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:32,800
May I ask who Hai is?

141
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:37,800
I'm Jesse.

142
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:40,800
Hai, I called you last night.

143
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:42,800
I wanted to do some business with you.

144
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:44,800
I was waiting for you.

145
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:46,800
Come in.

146
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:48,800
The boat is about to leave.

147
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:50,800
Come in, Hai.

148
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:52,800
I'm more rough than you.

149
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:56,800
I'm talking about this.

150
00:10:57,800 --> 00:10:59,800
Come in.

151
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:09,800
Hai, are we going to work here?

152
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:11,800
Of course not.

153
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:13,800
Don't ask so much.

154
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:15,800
You'll know when you get there.

155
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:20,800
Are these two pretty ladies here to work?

156
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:21,800
Yes.

157
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:24,800
Aren't you tired of working?

158
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:26,800
Yes.

159
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:28,800
Come on, everyone.

160
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:30,800
Listen to me.

161
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:32,800
Take out your phones.

162
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:34,800
Tell your family that you're safe.

163
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:36,800
Then call me.

164
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:38,800
What for?

165
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:40,800
There's no other way.

166
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:42,800
It's the company's rule.

167
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:44,800
We need to make a lot of money.

168
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:46,800
What do you mean?

169
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:48,800
You're not even paying for your phone.

170
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:50,800
This isn't a company.

171
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:52,800
I'm done.

172
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:54,800
Take me home.

173
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:00,800
I told you.

174
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:02,800
You can't go anywhere

175
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:04,800
without your family.

176
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:06,800
You're threatening me?

177
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:08,800
You're a coward.

178
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:10,800
I'm not going to give you a face.

179
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:12,800
Call the police.

180
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:14,800
Come on.

181
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:16,800
What are you doing?

182
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:18,800
Let's go.

183
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:20,800
What are you doing?

184
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:22,800
What are you doing?

185
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:24,800
Let him go.

186
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:26,800
It's okay.

187
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:28,800
It's okay.

188
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:30,800
It's okay.

189
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:32,800
Sit there.

190
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:35,800
Sit down.

191
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:42,800
Come on.

192
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:44,800
You're not going anywhere.

193
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:46,800
I'll let you go.

194
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:50,800
Are you happy now?

195
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:56,800
Come on.

196
00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:58,800
Let's go.

197
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:00,800
Is it fun?

198
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:02,800
Anyone else?

199
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:04,800
Come here.

200
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:10,800
You're so annoying.

201
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:12,800
Let's go.

202
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:32,800
Who is it?

203
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:34,800
It's me.

204
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:36,800
Come in.

205
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:38,800
Come in.

206
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:42,800
You're so generous.

207
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:44,800
It's been days.

208
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:46,800
You didn't even tell me you were safe.

209
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:48,800
I have good news.

210
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:50,800
I'm busy making money.

211
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:52,800
What are you busy with?

212
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:54,800
I'm busy with my work.

213
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:56,800
I'm busy with my work.

214
00:13:56,800 --> 00:13:58,800
I'm busy with my work.

215
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:00,800
What are you busy with?

216
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:02,800
I'm telling you.

217
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:04,800
You're promoted to vice captain.

218
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:06,800
I'm going to take a leave.

219
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:12,800
What vice captain?

220
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:14,800
Tell the manager I'm not doing it.

221
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:16,800
I don't have a salary.

222
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:18,800
You just got out.

223
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:20,800
What do you mean?

224
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:22,800
A security captain is still a vice captain.

225
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:24,800
You do it.

226
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:26,800
I'll tell the manager when I get back.

227
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:28,800
Bye.

228
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:38,800
Who is it?

229
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:52,800
What are you doing?

230
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:54,800
What are you doing?

231
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:56,800
I'm a cop.

232
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:58,800
I didn't hear you.

233
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:00,800
What kind of cop are you?

234
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:02,800
You're a security guard.

235
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:04,800
Why are you pushing me?

236
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:10,800
Give me my phone back.

237
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:12,800
What are you doing?

238
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:20,800
What's the matter?

239
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:24,800
What's the matter?

240
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:28,800
You don't even dare to show your face.

241
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:30,800
Get ready to go.

242
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:54,800
Hurry, hurry.

243
00:15:56,800 --> 00:15:58,800
Hurry.

244
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:02,800
Hurry.

245
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:08,800
Hurry!

246
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:10,800
Hurry!

247
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:20,800
Hurry!

248
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:23,800
Follow up

249
00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:28,500
Hurry up, hurry up, the

250
00:16:28,500 --> 00:16:29,500
motorcycle is stopping

251
00:16:31,020 --> 00:16:32,020
Hurry up, hurry up, follow up

252
00:16:33,520 --> 00:16:34,520
Hurry up, hurry up, hurry up

253
00:16:35,560 --> 00:16:36,560
Hurry up, hurry up

254
00:16:39,160 --> 00:16:40,160
Hurry up

255
00:16:43,960 --> 00:16:44,960
Hurry up

256
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:53,880
What are you doing?

257
00:16:55,180 --> 00:16:56,180
What are you doing?

258
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:14,280
You'll get used to it in the future

259
00:17:14,280 --> 00:17:17,640
I'm telling you, this is our company's grave

260
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:20,540
In the future, whoever runs away and doesn't listen

261
00:17:20,540 --> 00:17:22,540
will be brought here by the company

262
00:17:23,140 --> 00:17:24,140
Hurry up

263
00:17:33,740 --> 00:17:36,740
Let me go, let me go

264
00:17:50,540 --> 00:17:51,540
Hurry up, hurry up, hurry up, hurry up

265
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:15,300
Silver stars

266
00:18:15,700 --> 00:18:18,700
Flowing like a dream

267
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:22,140
And gently

268
00:18:22,140 --> 00:18:24,220
quotes

269
00:18:24,220 --> 00:18:25,540
embrace

270
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:29,040
our fingertips

271
00:18:29,500 --> 00:18:32,020
inspired

272
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:35,240
feet in predictions

273
00:18:35,240 --> 00:18:37,720
once I'm a fire

274
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:41,720
65

275
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:46,280
flappant

276
00:18:46,280 --> 00:18:52,280
I know where to go and where to go

277
00:18:52,280 --> 00:18:58,280
The lights are gone, the night is gone, the fireflies are back

278
00:18:58,280 --> 00:19:06,280
Shining, lighting up the way to the faraway place

279
00:19:06,280 --> 00:19:13,280
I'm with you in the storm

280
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:20,280
Floating in the dust

281
00:19:20,280 --> 00:19:27,280
In the cold and the whirling

282
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:37,280
The dawn never falls
