00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Uncle Feng!

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Uncle Feng, I've been with you for so many years!

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,000
How could I do this to you?

7
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Uncle Feng, I wronged you!

8
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Uncle Feng!

9
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Uncle Feng, the man was cheated by the Black Ghost.

10
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
The gold was lost by the Black Ghost.

11
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
You took the water room back.

12
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
I never talked to Wang Jincheng.

13
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
How could I be the mole?

14
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Uncle Feng, the 13th Office is always cautious.

15
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,000
He knew I was going to do it.

16
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,000
He deliberately put such important documents

17
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
in the office.

18
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
He's fishing! He's fishing!

19
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,000
He's fishing me!

20
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Bullshit!

21
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Uncle Feng, I came for the antidote.

22
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
I wanted to save my sister.

23
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
But you stole it.

24
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
You framed me again!

25
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
You cheated me again!

26
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,000
I'm telling you.

27
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
If anything happens to my sister,

28
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
I'll kill you!

29
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Uncle Feng, the 13th Office did ask me

30
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
for help because he wanted to save my sister.

31
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,000
I think he's very emotional.

32
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
So I agreed to let him try.

33
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,000
I didn't expect Brother Dong...

34
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Uncle Feng! Uncle Feng, listen to me!

35
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:26,000
I want evidence! I want evidence, Uncle Feng!

36
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Xiong, let him go.

37
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Uncle Feng, I have evidence.

38
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Last time, on the 13th,

39
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,000
my subordinate was found.

40
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Uncle Feng, let me make a call.

41
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
I beg you. Let me make a call.

42
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
You'll know immediately what kind of person he is!

43
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Give him a call.

44
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Thank you, Uncle Feng.

45
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Thank you, Sister Zha.

46
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,000
He's my subordinate.

47
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
He's not investigating at all.

48
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
I don't want to be caught easily.

49
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
I don't want it to be a misunderstanding.

50
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Do you understand?

51
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:10,000
If he doesn't want this,

52
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,000
the dog has a good hammer in its back.

53
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
He knows it's dangerous.

54
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:18,000
This is exactly why he decided to use lower power.

55
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
There simply can't be Hello.

56
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,000
All right?

57
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Fine.

58
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,000
People who mention the number,

59
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,200
Han Che, you're a crazy man

60
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:29,560
Just a phone call

61
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:31,600
I know the enemy is a man and a ghost

62
00:02:31,880 --> 00:02:32,720
I can tell him

63
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:34,880
I can also say you are a cop

64
00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:37,680
Dongge Dongge

65
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,040
I have a group of photos

66
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:39,960
I'll send it to you

67
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:41,960
Send it to me quickly

68
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:43,360
Send it to me quickly

69
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:49,760
Han Che

70
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:51,560
This is your father

71
00:02:52,040 --> 00:02:53,040
This is you

72
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:54,360
This is Jingfu

73
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:56,520
Why don't you admit it and still want to hurt me?

74
00:02:56,760 --> 00:02:57,920
Feng Zhong, look

75
00:02:58,200 --> 00:02:59,800
Zhang Xin, look

76
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:00,760
Look

77
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:02,160
Look at him

78
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:03,360
He is a cop

79
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:06,600
Officer Han

80
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:09,800
You're hiding it really deep

81
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:11,600
Lock him in

82
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:13,600
Uncle Feng, you framed me

83
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:15,400
Uncle Feng, this photo is a fart

84
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:18,040
Heiguedong, I can't forgive you

85
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:19,760
You can't forgive me

86
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:22,120
Boy, you're crazy

87
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:26,880
Brother Dongge, is it convenient for you to talk now?

88
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:28,160
Say it, say it quickly

89
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:30,520
Captain Dong, Shisan is just a small role

90
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:31,800
Those photos just now

91
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:33,280
Can only solve the problem of the original beauty

92
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:35,240
The police have ordered to kill

93
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:36,920
The whole station will be bombed

94
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:38,640
You must not be careless

95
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:39,480
Hun Cheng

96
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,720
What did you say?

97
00:03:42,920 --> 00:03:43,760
He is a cop

98
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:50,800
Old man, my brother is on a business trip

99
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:51,800
When will you come back?

100
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:52,960
what

101
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,800
My ears are not working

102
00:03:58,240 --> 00:04:01,480
I said my brother is on a business trip

103
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:03,080
When will you come back?

104
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:04,080
Yes, yes, yes

105
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:07,440
My ears can't hear clearly

106
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:10,360
Young man, sit down first

107
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:12,080
I'll get you a glass of water

108
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:25,120
Brother Dongge

109
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:47,920
This Shisan is a cop

110
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:50,000
Come, come, come, drink water

111
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:54,320
Old man, when did this photo come out?

112
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:55,640
Yes, yes, yes

113
00:04:56,320 --> 00:05:00,720
My ears have been sick for a long time

114
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:02,800
It's heavy and light at the same time

115
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:08,120
Uncle, my brother's job is too hard

116
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:10,880
I have been persuading him not to be a cop

117
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:13,160
Do business with me and make some money

118
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:14,240
How good is that?

119
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:16,280
He just doesn't listen and has ideals

120
00:05:16,280 --> 00:05:18,640
What? You want to eat pears?

121
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:22,440
No, uncle, I don't want to eat pears

122
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:24,400
You eat it yourself, I'll go

123
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:25,400
What are you doing?

124
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:26,240
No, no, no

125
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:29,080
How can I eat it myself?

126
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:31,200
Young man, you are a guest

127
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:32,280
Sit down first

128
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:33,440
I'll wash your nose

129
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:35,800
No, uncle, you can hear me

130
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:38,520
What? My ears are not good

131
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:41,160
You speak louder

132
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:43,320
Coming

133
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:45,360
Young man, sit down first

134
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:46,040
Open the door

135
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:48,800
No, uncle, you can hear me

136
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:49,480
Uncle

137
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:50,440
What?

138
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:53,800
Sit down first, young man, don't rush

139
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:01,280
He is still here

140
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:03,120
He has been asking about Han Chuan

141
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:04,440
I will stabilize him

142
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:07,000
Although our Lan Ye succeeded this time

143
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:09,480
But the fraud group may suspect Han Chuan

144
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:12,800
Master, you mean

145
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:14,720
They will definitely investigate him in China

146
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:18,320
You should keep an eye on Han Chuan's family

147
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:21,720
Captain Dong

148
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:25,320
We cooperate well with the water room

149
00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:25,920
Sister Zhan

150
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:27,120
The comrades of the imperial court

151
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:29,080
have found many useful clues

152
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:31,400
The provincial court has given new orders

153
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:33,680
Under the premise of your guarantee of safety

154
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:36,080
Collect evidence of Yan Xu's brain and iron Buddha

155
00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:37,880
Try to lure him back to the country

156
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:39,200
and be punished by law

157
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:40,400
Captain Dong

158
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:44,160
You should be careful in the fraud group

159
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:46,400
We will cooperate with you

160
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:48,600
When you retreat

161
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:50,480
You...

162
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:51,280
Uncle

163
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:54,040
I will actively cooperate with you

164
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:55,800
It's a good thing for you

165
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:56,600
It's a good thing

166
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:01,040
Uncle

167
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:03,240
I wronged them

168
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:05,840
Uncle

169
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:07,360
I wronged them, uncle

170
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:08,240
Uncle

171
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:09,880
Han Chuan

172
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:11,840
You are so cruel

173
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
You are so cruel, Han Chuan

174
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:15,080
Uncle

175
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:17,160
Uncle, please believe me

176
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:17,880
I...

177
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:19,960
They all did harm to me, uncle

178
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:21,520
I said you finally told me

179
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:23,320
Uncle, please believe me

180
00:07:23,320 --> 00:07:24,920
I still can make money with you

181
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:25,640
Uncle

182
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:27,520
Uncle

183
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:30,480
God, you bastard

184
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:34,360
My brother is just a low-born

185
00:07:34,640 --> 00:07:35,800
He has no family

186
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:37,680
He has no family

187
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:38,400
Uncle

188
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:48,120
Uncle

189
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:02,960
Uncle

190
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:04,800
Look at Shisan

191
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:07,520
He is not greedy for money and not interested in color

192
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:09,960
Now that the position of Black Ghost Cave is out

193
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:11,320
You see

194
00:08:13,320 --> 00:08:14,160
Shisan

195
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:19,880
Do you think he is greedy or not?

196
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:34,080
Which one is good?

197
00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:39,440
The person who was cheated is greedy for money

198
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:44,400
Black Ghost Cave is out of the way to seize power

199
00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:49,120
Si Hai has been unable to be promoted

200
00:08:50,520 --> 00:08:51,880
That's for color

201
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,440
You are different from them

202
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:56,120
After you came in

203
00:08:57,320 --> 00:08:58,800
I have observed you for a long time

204
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:02,000
You don't talk about anything

205
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:05,440
What else is good?

206
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:09,200
Money, money, woman

207
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:11,960
I have enjoyed all these in China

208
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:15,040
In the end, the police did everything

209
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:17,200
I appreciate your ability

210
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:20,280
You can start over here

211
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:23,040
and get back everything you lost

212
00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:27,200
Uncle He, I came here

213
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:29,320
One is to find my sister

214
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:31,760
The other is to hide from the police

215
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:37,000
So I don't ask for much to do under Uncle He

216
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,320
I only ask for uncle He

217
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:47,320
Your sister will take good care of her

218
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:51,800
You can stay here and do your work

219
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:53,920
The rest

220
00:09:55,480 --> 00:09:56,720
You don't have to think about anything

221
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:00,160
Drink the soup

222
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:08,580
Okay

223
00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:23,160
Shisan, thank Uncle Buddha

224
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,200
Thank you, Uncle Buddha.

225
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,400
You're kind and thoughtful.

226
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:41,800
Not bad.

227
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:44,600
Uncle Buddha,

228
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:46,000
don't worry.

229
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,400
I'll let Shisan sit in the black hole.

230
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
Thank you, Uncle Buddha, for saving me.

231
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:05,600
I'll be grateful.

232
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,800
But I just arrived here, I'm still a newcomer.

233
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:11,400
I shouldn't be so hasty.

234
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:14,400
Don't be so anxious.

235
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,000
I'll give you time.

236
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:18,000
Think about it.

237
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:21,200
Yeah.

238
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:23,600
Think about it.

239
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:26,800
Thank you, Uncle Buddha.

240
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:28,600
Thank you, Miss.

241
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:37,960
With one stone,

242
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:41,000
with two stones,

243
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:43,000
we'll send all skills for you,

244
00:11:43,880 --> 00:11:45,200
and your drinking ability.

245
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:54,000
Hey.

246
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:57,000
Zhai Shi went into the black hole.

247
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:59,000
Who would he be

248
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:00,600
if he misses the spot?

249
00:12:00,840 --> 00:12:03,040
Of course it must be our Hai.

250
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:05,000
But I heard that

251
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,280
I'm so embarrassed.

252
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:07,800
Go.

253
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:08,680
Eat.

254
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:13,480
Brother.

255
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:17,160
Tie Fuzhen wants you to replace

256
00:12:17,160 --> 00:12:18,280
Pei Guidong's position.

257
00:12:21,640 --> 00:12:22,520
So you agreed?

258
00:12:25,280 --> 00:12:26,120
No.

259
00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:29,280
That's good.

260
00:12:29,640 --> 00:12:30,800
You don't know

261
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:31,840
Ba Sihai is now

262
00:12:31,840 --> 00:12:33,240
the top position.

263
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:34,160
If you agree,

264
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:35,600
you'll offend him.

265
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:36,880
Then we'll never

266
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:38,760
cross the line again.

267
00:12:38,760 --> 00:12:40,120
Sister won't be able to send him out.

268
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:44,520
Yes.

269
00:12:46,040 --> 00:12:46,960
Think about it.

270
00:12:49,080 --> 00:12:49,640
Brother.

271
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:50,840
Give me a bowl of mung bean soup.

272
00:12:50,840 --> 00:12:51,600
It's hot.

273
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:05,960
Uncle.

274
00:13:09,880 --> 00:13:10,600
Uncle.

275
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:12,600
My name is Sang Tuo.

276
00:13:12,920 --> 00:13:14,200
I'm Brother 13's brother.

277
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:20,200
Say it.

278
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:22,640
Uncle.

279
00:13:23,520 --> 00:13:24,800
You can't let Brother 13

280
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:26,720
replace Pei Guidong's position.

281
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:28,640
Why?

282
00:13:35,160 --> 00:13:36,760
We have 400 or 500 people.

283
00:13:37,280 --> 00:13:38,400
The most important thing

284
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:40,520
is balance.

285
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:43,000
13 is Ba Sihai's man.

286
00:13:43,640 --> 00:13:44,480
If he really

287
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:46,040
replaced Pei Guidong's position,

288
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:47,640
it's like Ba Sihai

289
00:13:47,640 --> 00:13:49,280
has the whole second floor.

290
00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:51,800
When he gets more powerful,

291
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:53,400
it'll be hard

292
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:55,200
to balance.

293
00:13:57,360 --> 00:13:58,160
Go on.

294
00:13:58,160 --> 00:13:59,920
We have a lot of people.

295
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:01,440
I just want to make money.

296
00:14:02,360 --> 00:14:03,680
More and more money.

297
00:14:05,160 --> 00:14:06,760
Uncle Buddha gave me the most money.

298
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:08,680
I only listen to him.

299
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:11,880
I, Sang Tuo,

300
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:14,600
beg Uncle Buddha

301
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:16,000
to give me another chance.

302
00:14:16,840 --> 00:14:17,760
Three months.

303
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:20,600
In three months,

304
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:22,560
I'll make Lu Liao Clan

305
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:24,200
a rich family.

306
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:26,440
If I can't do it,

307
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:29,040
Sang Tuo will come to see you

308
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:30,480
with his head.

309
00:14:34,680 --> 00:14:35,880
You're brave.

310
00:14:37,520 --> 00:14:39,080
Your personality and appearance

311
00:14:39,080 --> 00:14:40,720
remind me of

312
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:43,400
an old friend.

313
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:05,800
After me too,

314
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:07,840
I almost died.

315
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:22,080
Why?

316
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:24,120
My heart Stew bag.

317
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:26,200
I have never had aouchi since I was born.

318
00:15:28,840 --> 00:15:32,360
Life is like a movie.

319
00:16:32,360 --> 00:16:39,360
The balance of the waves, the whirlpool above

320
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:49,360
The dawn has never fainted
