1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
The Taoism Grandmaster

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Episode 16

3
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:21,600
Judging from Wang Jincheng's reaction,

4
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:24,040
An Fei should be by his side.

5
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:28,000
But why is he so decisive?

6
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Was he scared by the 20 million?

7
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,600
But I've already passed on this clue.

8
00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:37,000
What should I do now?

9
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:38,800
Jiang Hai

10
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:41,200
has no other suitable target.

11
00:00:42,400 --> 00:00:43,400
Calm down.

12
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:45,200
Calm down.

13
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:46,600
Calm down.

14
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:49,400
There must be a way.

15
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:51,600
There must be a way.

16
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:52,800
Brother.

17
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:54,200
Brother.

18
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,000
I just heard that

19
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
An Fei is about to be pushed into the spirit beast room.

20
00:00:58,800 --> 00:00:59,800
What?

21
00:00:59,800 --> 00:01:00,400
Brother.

22
00:01:00,400 --> 00:01:01,000
Don't be angry.

23
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:01,600
Don't be angry.

24
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:03,200
It's no use for you to go down now.

25
00:01:03,400 --> 00:01:04,600
Hurry up and get 20 million

26
00:01:04,600 --> 00:01:06,000
before you can really save your life.

27
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:11,800
It's too late.

28
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:12,600
You...

29
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,200
It's too late.

30
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Brother.

31
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:17,400
You just arrived.

32
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,600
You don't know much.

33
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:22,000
People who are sent to the spirit beast room

34
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:24,400
must enter the room two hours in advance.

35
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:27,000
The procedure is to

36
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:28,400
complete the task.

37
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:30,400
Do you think

38
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:32,600
Uncle Buddha will call you at six o'clock?

39
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:33,800
No.

40
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:35,400
It's at six o'clock.

41
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:41,400
The first strike.

42
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:45,800
No.

43
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:46,400
Gui Dong.

44
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:47,600
What are you doing?

45
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:48,400
What are you doing?

46
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:51,000
Get out.

47
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Get up.

48
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:53,400
Who are you to stand there?

49
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:55,600
Get away.

50
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Let's finish this.

51
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:21,600
You can be sure now

52
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:22,600
Hanshuang and Xiaoxiao

53
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:24,200
do stand already.

54
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:25,440
Why didn't you prepare

55
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:26,920
such a large amount of money earlier?

56
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:27,720
Director Wu,

57
00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:29,200
we don't have any clues.

58
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:30,760
There should be a victim

59
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:31,720
who didn't report the case.

60
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:35,680
It seems that it's only an hour and a half

61
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:37,080
from six o'clock.

62
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:38,520
Time is so short.

63
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:39,760
The amount of money is so large.

64
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:41,320
There is no other way.

65
00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:43,720
We can only continue to do Wang Jincheng's work.

66
00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:45,400
But he doesn't cooperate with us at all.

67
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:46,640
The amount of money is too big.

68
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:48,000
If he doesn't cooperate,

69
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:49,480
it's also a matter of human nature.

70
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:51,640
What he is most worried about

71
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:53,480
is the removal of his funds.

72
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:54,120
Well,

73
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:55,160
Yang Yang,

74
00:02:55,320 --> 00:02:56,320
go to the banks immediately

75
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:57,560
and ask them to remove the funds

76
00:02:57,720 --> 00:02:58,680
and cooperate with us to stop ourselves.

77
00:02:58,800 --> 00:02:59,280
Yes.

78
00:02:59,400 --> 00:02:59,800
Jiaqi,

79
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:01,040
go and check the video

80
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:02,320
to see if there is any missing.

81
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:03,080
Yes.

82
00:04:23,900 --> 00:04:24,480
Hui,

83
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:26,600
get us the picture of the increasing prices

84
00:04:26,860 --> 00:04:34,600
from Familyhan

85
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:37,240
to the Editor-in-Chief for me to talk.

86
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:42,040
I'm the director's deputy.

87
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:46,320
disadvantageous paper

88
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:48,760
bro

89
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:51,120
Don't put it on this tree.

90
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:52,520
I found a few customers.

91
00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:31,060
No response

92
00:05:39,020 --> 00:05:40,460
Time is up

93
00:05:40,460 --> 00:05:41,540
we are about to die

94
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:45,600
The time is almost up

95
00:05:45,980 --> 00:05:47,000
do it

96
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:50,600
Big brother, there are five minutes left.

97
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:52,400
How about we wait a little longer?

98
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:54,800
Brother Zha has a lot of talent.

99
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:57,240
Two years ago, the Hong Kong government's government's

100
00:05:57,240 --> 00:05:59,200
deposit was cheated 1.2 billion.

101
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:01,000
It was his fault.

102
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
I wanted to see him face to face.

103
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
I didn't have the chance.

104
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:14,000
Brother Zha.

105
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Today's market price is 150,000 for heart.

106
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:23,000
90,000 for liver.

107
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:26,200
650,000 for kidney.

108
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:28,200
10,000.

109
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:32,400
If you calculate it like this, your sister is worth a lot of money.

110
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:34,000
Black-headed!

111
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,200
What are you saying? Get up!

112
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:39,000
Get up. Get up.

113
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:41,200
What's wrong?

114
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:42,800
13 is my person.

115
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:44,600
Why would I need you to be here?

116
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:46,400
Brother Si Hai,

117
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:49,000
if you talk about me again,

118
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
I'll keep my eyes on you.

119
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
Don't let them say a few words and you'll be fooled.

120
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:56,400
What do you care? It's none of your business!

121
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:12,800
Sorry, comrade.

122
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:14,800
I just went out to withdraw money.

123
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:16,800
Now, I have enough money.

124
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:18,600
Send me the card number.

125
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:20,800
I'll transfer a few to you.

126
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:22,400
Okay.

127
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,600
I'll transfer a few to you.

128
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:15,800
Okay.

129
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:38,600
Where's the

130
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:41,000
Master,

131
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,600
I did it willingly.

132
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:44,400
I know An Chuan very well.

133
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:46,000
If it was just him,

134
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:50,200
no matter how dangerous he was, he wouldn't take such a big risk.

135
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:53,800
It must be Xiao Xiao who was in danger of death.

136
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:55,600
Master,

137
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:59,000
I can lose my house and money,

138
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,600
but I can't lose my brother.

139
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:04,200
Captain An, it's not enough to have only you.

140
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:05,600
Count me in.

141
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:08,200
Director Wu, I'll take a day off today.

142
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:10,000
Yaoyao.

143
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,800
Director Wu.

144
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:13,800
I'll take a day off, too.

145
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:26,000
Director Wu, I'll take a day off, too.

146
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:41,200
Fei, go to my office.

147
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:46,680
Master, this is the only way we can save Han Chuan.

148
00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:50,680
Fei, as the captain, you're making a mess.

149
00:09:50,680 --> 00:09:52,880
The company's fishing account is being transferred.

150
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:54,560
This is a abuse of power, you know?

151
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:57,280
If we can't stop it, can you and I bear it?

152
00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:03,560
Report, Wang Jincheng called.

153
00:10:03,560 --> 00:10:04,760
He said he wants us to cooperate.

154
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:11,200
I think I understand.

155
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:15,200
I'm sure Wang Jincheng will do it today.

156
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:18,200
Officer Han was cheated by the people

157
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:20,200
and even risked his own life for the people.

158
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:23,200
Can I be a bad person?

159
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:25,200
20 million. I can afford it.

160
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:28,200
I'm still fighting with this fraud group.

161
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:32,200
Manager Wang, thank you.

162
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:34,200
This...

163
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:36,200
You...

164
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:38,200
You...

165
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:43,200
Wait.

166
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:47,200
What we're going to do this time is not only to protect Han Chuan,

167
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:49,200
but also to use this video to

168
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:53,200
pass on the clues of the recent gold fraud case in our city.

169
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:57,200
We should cooperate and fight for a beautiful cooperation.

170
00:11:06,460 --> 00:11:21,120
Subscribers Thank you for watching

171
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,820
Sorry.

172
00:11:28,820 --> 00:11:30,500
I should have left to take a little training.

173
00:11:30,500 --> 00:11:32,900
Now that I've made enough money,

174
00:11:32,900 --> 00:11:34,620
Now, we have enough money.

175
00:11:35,140 --> 00:11:36,540
Send me the card number.

176
00:11:37,180 --> 00:11:38,220
I'll transfer it to you.

177
00:11:48,260 --> 00:11:49,060
You sent it?

178
00:11:50,140 --> 00:11:51,740
What are you doing?

179
00:11:52,420 --> 00:11:53,140
Mr. Wang.

180
00:11:53,380 --> 00:11:54,700
You asked me to hang it.

181
00:11:54,820 --> 00:11:56,500
You didn't see me busy, right?

182
00:11:56,820 --> 00:11:58,180
You're so shameless.

183
00:11:58,380 --> 00:11:59,660
Get out of here.

184
00:12:03,420 --> 00:12:04,540
Sorry, comrade.

185
00:12:05,540 --> 00:12:06,540
I'm sorry.

186
00:12:06,900 --> 00:12:08,260
I didn't get the money.

187
00:12:08,780 --> 00:12:10,060
I'll transfer it to you.

188
00:12:32,900 --> 00:12:33,900
I'll transfer it to you.

189
00:13:03,340 --> 00:13:04,540
Welcome execute.

190
00:13:04,940 --> 00:13:05,740
Please go.

191
00:13:14,980 --> 00:13:15,820
chant-mantra.

192
00:13:16,860 --> 00:13:18,900
I can't do it but he can.

193
00:13:18,900 --> 00:13:19,940
Awesome.

194
00:13:21,340 --> 00:13:22,060
it's it's.

195
00:13:22,660 --> 00:13:23,300
Yilan.

196
00:13:24,340 --> 00:13:25,380
You and sister don't have to die.

197
00:13:32,900 --> 00:13:33,700
uncle Kuo

198
00:13:33,980 --> 00:13:35,580
Ten or two thousand yuan has been paid

199
00:13:35,980 --> 00:13:36,700
Money is here

200
00:13:38,540 --> 00:13:39,780
Tell the defence to get to work

201
00:13:41,780 --> 00:13:42,500
What about his sister?

202
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:46,820
Solo

203
00:13:52,700 --> 00:13:53,940
Time's up

204
00:13:54,580 --> 00:13:56,740
It's not the ability you speak

205
00:14:01,460 --> 00:14:02,860
And,

206
00:14:02,900 --> 00:14:04,900
Let's do it.

207
00:14:13,220 --> 00:14:15,220
What did you do?

208
00:14:15,220 --> 00:14:17,580
He got the 20 million.

209
00:14:17,580 --> 00:14:20,780
Uncle Fu said he would release his sister first.

210
00:14:20,780 --> 00:14:23,620
I think it's not my fault.

211
00:14:23,620 --> 00:14:27,220
There's nothing wrong with the three of you.

212
00:14:28,100 --> 00:14:29,780
How did you see him?

213
00:14:29,780 --> 00:14:31,980
He was punished.

214
00:14:32,260 --> 00:14:34,860
Uncle Fu said

215
00:14:34,860 --> 00:14:39,300
that you should send your sister back first.

216
00:14:39,300 --> 00:14:41,700
Okay.

217
00:14:43,780 --> 00:14:47,780
Xiang Xiang! Xiang Xiang!

218
00:14:50,540 --> 00:14:52,580
Say three.

219
00:14:54,500 --> 00:14:58,700
Xiang Xiang! Xiang Xiang!

220
00:15:01,980 --> 00:15:03,980
Xiang Xiang!

221
00:15:06,140 --> 00:15:08,900
Thirteen, right?

222
00:15:08,900 --> 00:15:11,900
After your sister...

223
00:15:11,900 --> 00:15:14,100
It's my turn.

224
00:15:15,260 --> 00:15:17,900
Xiao Jian can come to me.

225
00:15:17,900 --> 00:15:20,380
I will take good care of her.

226
00:16:02,140 --> 00:16:05,460
Silver starry sky

227
00:16:05,460 --> 00:16:09,180
Sparks like dreams

228
00:16:09,180 --> 00:16:15,860
Flowing through the window

229
00:16:15,860 --> 00:16:19,180
Fingers are like light

230
00:16:19,180 --> 00:16:22,180
Melted winter

231
00:16:22,180 --> 00:16:29,340
In my palm, you are holding me tight

232
00:16:29,340 --> 00:16:36,140
In the mist, the nameless bell

233
00:16:36,140 --> 00:16:42,140
I know where to go and where to go

234
00:16:42,140 --> 00:16:45,580
The light fades, the night color

235
00:16:45,580 --> 00:16:48,940
The fireflies are shining

236
00:16:48,940 --> 00:16:56,140
Lighting up the way, the caravan

237
00:16:56,140 --> 00:17:03,260
You and I are locked in the storm

238
00:17:03,260 --> 00:17:10,020
Floating in the dust

239
00:17:10,020 --> 00:17:13,540
In the cold river

240
00:17:13,540 --> 00:17:16,860
In the whirlpool
