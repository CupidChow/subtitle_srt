00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,200
Once we meet,

5
00:00:32,140 --> 00:00:33,280
I'll dive into the sea

6
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:38,160
to realise my wish

7
00:00:39,240 --> 00:00:40,120
Wait a moment

Hello

14
00:00:57,560 --> 00:00:58,160
Brother

15
00:00:58,280 --> 00:00:58,760
Brother

16
00:00:58,920 --> 00:00:59,920
Where are you going?

17
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,240
That's my professional habit.

18
00:01:01,720 --> 00:01:02,840
You can say that

19
00:01:03,320 --> 00:01:15,760
this is a cookie to a

20
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:20,280
He's really here.

21
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:22,160
You can imagine

22
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:24,280
if he's here

23
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:26,360
in a second,

24
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:29,000
I'd get Strategists

25
00:01:29,480 --> 00:01:29,800
to take me

26
00:01:29,800 --> 00:01:31,800
You can cheat 9999 times

27
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:32,800
What's wrong?

28
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:34,800
Is this your rule?

29
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:35,800
Brother Hai

30
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:38,800
Four nine is my lucky number

31
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:40,800
Every first day of the month

32
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:41,800
is this number

33
00:01:41,800 --> 00:01:43,800
It can bring good luck

34
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:47,800
You can say you are not capable

35
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:49,800
Lucky number

36
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:52,800
You know what?

37
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:53,800
My brother's lucky number

38
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:55,800
can bring us good luck

39
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:57,800
Our team is full of good luck

40
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:00,800
This meat is not enough

41
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:03,800
Lucky number

42
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:05,800
What's wrong?

43
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:07,800
Our team is better than yours

44
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:10,800
We have opened three or four orders today

45
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:11,800
Unlike some teams

46
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:13,800
who didn't make any money

47
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:17,800
Look, take a good look

48
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:20,800
Do you know what is a store?

49
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:21,800
Do you understand?

50
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:23,800
No matter how many you have

51
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:24,800
you are just a small family

52
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:26,800
You are wasting the money

53
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:27,800
we bought

54
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:29,800
I will tell you

55
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:30,800
about this order

56
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:32,800
It's a daughter

57
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:34,800
who bought her mother's life

58
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:37,800
She has 300,000 yuan in her hand

59
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:39,800
She has made it

60
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:41,800
She will close the store tomorrow

61
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:45,800
Hei Guidong

62
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:47,800
You can make money by saving her life

63
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:51,800
I didn't know

64
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:53,800
you are so noble

65
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:54,800
We all know

66
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:56,800
money is money

67
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:58,800
You can kill or save people

68
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:02,800
You really take yourself as a policeman

69
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:07,800
It's a pity that you are wearing this

70
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:09,800
You don't want to do it, do you?

71
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:10,800
Don't do it

72
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:11,800
Wait for tomorrow

73
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:14,800
to prepare for the birthday party

74
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:20,800
Go

75
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:24,800
Go

76
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:37,800
You must win her tomorrow

77
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:40,800
Otherwise

00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:42,800

Brother, have you seen deja vu?

126
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:41,800
I have checked it

127
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:43,800
I think Black Ghost does'nt believe universal

128
00:05:43,800 --> 00:06:08,200
I think that at least we must fight on as long as we have dzisiaj!

129
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:14,480
Okay

130
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:25,960
Yang YaQi

00:06:25,960 --> 00:06:43,160
Stop

132
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:44,160
I'm busy

133
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:55,720
No matter how many of you are, you are still a little kid

134
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:56,720
Look

135
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
Look carefully

136
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:01,280
It's the money that the filial daughter paid her mother

137
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:03,920
Mom, don't worry

138
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:05,680
I have already raised enough money in the emperor

139
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:06,880
I can get it tomorrow

140
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:10,320
Lv'er, I'm sorry

141
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:14,160
Hello

Hello, Miss Hu Pei

Your ID number is

00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:24,760
You are studying in the literature department of Donghu University

146
00:07:24,760 --> 00:07:26,360
Your mother is living in the country

147
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:28,360
You are studying in Donghu University, right?

148
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:30,360
You are

149
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:32,960

00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:35,960
I called you this time

00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:37,360
Mainly to inform you

153
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:38,960
Because our website is behind the scenes

154
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:39,960
Repair and upgrade

155
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:41,160
The number is not available

156
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:42,360

Your money

00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:47,360
It will be paid after three to five days

160
00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:48,960
But I

161
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:49,960
What's wrong?

162
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:55,160
It's okay, mom

163
00:07:55,160 --> 00:07:56,160
School matter

164
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:57,560
You rest here first

165
00:07:57,560 --> 00:07:58,560
I'll call you later

166
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:07,160
Hello

167
00:08:07,960 --> 00:08:09,360
My mother is going to have surgery the day after tomorrow

168
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:10,760
I really need this money very much

169
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:12,760
I'm sorry, Miss Hu

170
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:15,960
What can I do

171
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:17,560
Can I make it tomorrow?

172
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:19,760
Without this money, my mother can't do the surgery

173
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:21,360
I really need it very much

174
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:23,160

The virus has entered her phone

195
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:06,560
As long as I still have to pay her tomorrow

196
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:08,960
We can end the network

197
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:11,960
brother

198
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:12,760
brother

199
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:13,760
Today we do one thing

200
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:15,560
Take a step and forget it

201
00:09:15,560 --> 00:09:16,760
You hit the iron while you are here

202
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:18,760
brother

203
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:21,360
What are you doing?

204
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:22,360
What do you mean

205
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:25,760
This is the rule of my work

206
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:27,560
You can also understand

207
00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:28,760
Is a good product for the good

208
00:09:41,560 --> 00:09:43,360
Captain An, have breakfast

209
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:53,360
And then

210
00:09:53,560 --> 00:09:54,760
He finally said

211
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:55,760
He told me to remember

212
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:56,960
He said he was going to do it with his heart

213
00:09:56,960 --> 00:09:57,760
With his heart

214
00:09:57,760 --> 00:09:58,560
With his heart

215
00:09:58,560 --> 00:09:59,360
With his heart

216
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:02,160
Han Chuan

217
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:06,560
What does it mean

218
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:09,160
An Fei

219
00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:12,760
The time to test our tacit understanding has come

220
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:16,160
With heart

221
00:10:31,960 --> 00:10:32,960
With heart

222
00:10:35,560 --> 00:10:36,760
With heart

223
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:40,560
With heart

224
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:42,560
With heart

225
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:49,560
With heart

226
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:13,760
Powerful and noble

227
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:17,560
Heart-wrenching

228
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:19,960
The evil is a crime

229
00:11:20,960 --> 00:11:22,760
The heart is higher than the sky

230
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:24,960
The evil name of the red horse

231
00:11:25,960 --> 00:11:27,760
Return to the empty turtle

232
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:42,560
The world is against the east

233
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:43,960
The evil is trying to take the enemy

234
00:11:43,960 --> 00:11:45,160
The thunder rages in the dream of the Jin family

235
00:11:45,160 --> 00:11:46,760
The eyes and eyes are blinded by the new alliance

236
00:11:46,760 --> 00:11:48,160
The eyes and eyes are blinded by the old and the new

237
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:49,560
The world is not as good as the chaos

238
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:57,160
The lie is very pure

239
00:11:57,560 --> 00:11:58,760
Hu Daxue

240
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:00,960
Hu Pei

241
00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:03,560
Mom, I just finished class

242
00:12:03,560 --> 00:12:04,560
I'll be right over

243
00:12:04,760 --> 00:12:05,560
Hu Pei

244
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:06,960
Teacher Zhou

245
00:12:07,160 --> 00:12:08,360
How is your mother recently

246
00:12:08,760 --> 00:12:10,560
The doctor said she can arrange the operation tomorrow

247
00:12:10,760 --> 00:12:11,960
You just went to college

248
00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:13,160
Take care of mom

249
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:14,160
This is our college

250
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:15,360
Teachers have to be considerate

251
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:16,760
I hope you don't work too hard

252
00:12:16,760 --> 00:12:17,760
No need, Teacher Zhou

253
00:12:17,960 --> 00:12:18,960
I don't donate money online

254
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:20,360
The money can be paid today

255
00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:21,760
You can be heavily favored online

256
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:22,960
We can't donate

257
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:24,760
This is your loan

258
00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:26,160
Return it to us in the future

259
00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:28,960
it is good

260
00:12:29,160 --> 00:12:30,360
I will definitely return it

261
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:31,560
Thank you, Teacher Zhou

262
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:39,760
Dongge

263
00:12:39,960 --> 00:12:42,160
Hu Pei's new money has arrived

264
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:47,160
Great

265
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:50,960
I can't get through

266
00:12:50,960 --> 00:12:51,760
You try

267
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:56,160
Hello

268
00:12:56,960 --> 00:12:57,960
I can't get through either

269
00:12:58,560 --> 00:12:59,360
Hu Pei's phone

270
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:00,160
It is likely to be cheated

271
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:01,760
The signal of the user's means of payment

272
00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:02,960
Can't get in

273
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:11,360
You are not clean

274
00:13:19,960 --> 00:13:21,160
What are you looking at

275
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:22,360
Get out

276
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:25,960
I think Dongge's bill is about to be done

277
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:27,960
I'll come and learn

278
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:28,960
Brother, don't look

279
00:13:28,960 --> 00:13:30,760
Let's go back and work

280
00:13:30,760 --> 00:13:31,560
it is good

281
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:32,960
Kid

282
00:13:33,960 --> 00:13:35,160
Let me show you

283
00:13:35,860 --> 00:13:36,960
How you died

284
00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:38,760
All right

285
00:13:38,760 --> 00:13:39,400
Which hospital?

286
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:40,320
Donghu Hospital.

287
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:41,120
Okay, thank you.

288
00:13:50,520 --> 00:13:51,640
Hello?

289
00:13:51,640 --> 00:13:53,160
Hello, Ms. Hu Lian.

290
00:13:53,160 --> 00:13:54,960
I'm the customer service of Aisin Chou.

291
00:13:54,960 --> 00:13:56,760
The number is 13102.

292
00:13:56,760 --> 00:13:58,000
I'll contact you tomorrow.

293
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,440
Hello.

294
00:13:59,960 --> 00:14:02,360
Can I make a reservation now?

295
00:14:02,760 --> 00:14:03,880
The materials you submitted

296
00:14:03,880 --> 00:14:05,080
have been reviewed.

297
00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:06,320
The Aisin credit

298
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:07,880
has been transferred to your account.

299
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:09,840
You can use it anytime.

300
00:14:09,840 --> 00:14:11,400
Great, thank you.

301
00:14:11,400 --> 00:14:13,320
You can check the bank card

302
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:14,520
to make sure it's in the account.

303
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:15,520
Okay.

304
00:14:19,640 --> 00:14:20,200
I see it.

305
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:21,480
The money is in the account.

306
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:22,440
Ms. Hu,

307
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:24,000
you're a special client.

308
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,560
You'll receive a verification code later.

309
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:28,200
You need to tell me the verification code.

310
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:30,320
I'll make a memorandum for you.

311
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:31,600
Okay.

312
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:34,360
Ms. Hu,

313
00:14:34,360 --> 00:14:35,560
have you received the verification code?

314
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:37,120
I have.

315
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:38,320
Let me check.

316
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:42,240
It's...

317
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:43,240
Six...

318
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:45,480
Three...

319
00:14:46,840 --> 00:14:47,840
Nine...

320
00:14:48,440 --> 00:14:49,440
Two...

321
00:15:05,940 --> 00:15:07,460
Fine, you're until now.

322
00:15:07,460 --> 00:15:09,400
Maybe next time I won't be around.

323
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:10,720
Well, what do you mean?

324
00:15:12,260 --> 00:15:14,260
Let's keep the world safe for now.

325
00:15:16,260 --> 00:15:17,660
The first thing in my mind

326
00:15:19,580 --> 00:15:20,560
is I want to

327
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:22,160
leave the world with you.

328
00:15:24,780 --> 00:15:25,940
Then,

329
00:15:25,940 --> 00:15:27,140
why don't we

330
00:16:35,560 --> 00:16:48,760
The whirlpool of love never fades away
