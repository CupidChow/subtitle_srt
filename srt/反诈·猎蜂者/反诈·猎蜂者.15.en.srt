00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
The King of Blaze

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Episode 16

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Yaoyao.

4
00:00:15,800 --> 00:00:17,160
Have you sorted out the documents?

5
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:18,040
I'll go to the WeChat.

6
00:00:18,040 --> 00:00:18,920
I'll be right there.

7
00:00:18,920 --> 00:00:19,440
Okay.

8
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:21,440
Hello, this is Jianghai City Public Security Bureau.

9
00:00:21,440 --> 00:00:22,440
So many?

10
00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:24,600
What's wrong?

11
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:27,840
These three people

12
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:28,800
haven't been able to take a shower yet.

13
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:29,920
They're all here.

14
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:32,440
One hundred and eight hundred million.

15
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:36,320
One hundred and eight hundred million?

16
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:38,560
How long has it been, Liu Shui?

17
00:00:38,560 --> 00:00:39,560
About ten thousand.

18
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:41,640
In a month,

19
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:44,000
they'll cheat five to six hundred million people.

20
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,360
That's only a small area.

21
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:48,760
Luckily, Captain Han saw our secret.

22
00:00:48,760 --> 00:00:49,760
Otherwise,

23
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:50,880
we don't know how many victims

24
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:51,800
will be cheated.

25
00:00:51,800 --> 00:00:52,600
Bai Qi,

26
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:54,280
follow the self-sustaining flow to get back to the plain.

27
00:00:54,280 --> 00:00:54,800
At the same time,

28
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:56,120
send out a notice to the society

29
00:00:56,120 --> 00:00:58,400
to collect clues for the victims of the emergency case.

30
00:00:58,400 --> 00:00:59,840
Return the money to them as soon as possible.

31
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:01,720
The money-washing road is cut off.

32
00:01:01,720 --> 00:01:02,800
I guess

33
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:04,640
before they build the water tank,

34
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:06,800
there won't be any big fraudulent actions.

35
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:07,600
In that case,

36
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:09,640
will Captain Han's pressure be reduced?

37
00:01:09,640 --> 00:01:11,040
Not necessarily.

38
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:12,880
Black Ghost is the team leader of the original area.

39
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:14,240
His position is not low.

40
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:15,840
If he doesn't do well,

41
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:17,280
it will cause a lot of people to fight.

42
00:01:19,440 --> 00:01:20,640
I hope Han Chun

43
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:21,760
can be involved.

44
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:28,480
Brother Hai,

45
00:01:28,520 --> 00:01:29,960
Shisan is sensible.

46
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:32,720
If he dares to steal the position of the new team leader,

47
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:35,880
he will be killed tomorrow.

48
00:01:38,160 --> 00:01:39,480
The second floor

49
00:01:39,480 --> 00:01:40,880
is missing my brother.

50
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:43,520
It's so quiet.

51
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:49,560
What are you doing?

52
00:01:58,480 --> 00:01:59,760
Congratulations, Brother Hai.

53
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:00,680
From now on,

54
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:03,160
everyone in the second floor will be called Dad.

55
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:09,240
It's not because Black Ghost likes you.

56
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:10,240
You are sensible.

57
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:12,080
But it's too early to say that.

58
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:13,840
Uncle Buddha hasn't announced it yet.

59
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:16,080
Uncle Buddha just came to go through a process.

60
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:16,760
Only you, Brother Hai, can

61
00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:18,280
take the position of Black Ghost

62
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:20,280
in the Eastern Region.

63
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:21,880
You are the only one who can do it.

64
00:02:21,880 --> 00:02:23,280
I'm not afraid of you.

65
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:24,280
I'm not afraid of you.

66
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:25,280
I'm not afraid of you.

67
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:26,280
I'm not afraid of you.

68
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:27,280
I'm not afraid of you.

69
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:29,680
Only you, Brother Hai, can do it.

70
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:31,480
Whoever doesn't accept it,

71
00:02:31,480 --> 00:02:33,280
I will be the first one to disagree.

72
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:34,680
Brothers,

73
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:36,080
don't you agree?

74
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:37,280
Yes.

75
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:38,280
Brother Hai.

76
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:39,280
Brother Hai.

77
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:40,280
Brother Hai.

78
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:41,280
Brother Hai.

79
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:42,280
Brother Hai.

80
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:43,280
Brother Hai.

81
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:44,280
Brother Hai.

82
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:45,280
Brother Hai.

83
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:47,280
Okay, okay, okay.

84
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:58,280
Shisan.

85
00:02:58,880 --> 00:03:00,880
I know that Buddha is angry with us.

86
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:02,880
But it's useless.

87
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:28,880
No matter what,

88
00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:30,880
you are new here.

89
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:33,280
Just follow me,

90
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:35,280
Ba Sihai.

91
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:37,280
Don't think of lying.

92
00:03:37,880 --> 00:03:38,880
Understand?

93
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:43,680
Everyone, do your best.

94
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:45,280
Follow me,

95
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:46,280
Ba Sihai.

96
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:48,280
Make money and share it with me.

97
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:49,280
Okay?

98
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:50,280
Okay.

99
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:51,280
Okay.

100
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:52,280
Okay.

101
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:53,280
Okay.

102
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:54,280
Okay.

103
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:55,280
Okay.

104
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:56,280
Okay.

105
00:03:56,280 --> 00:03:58,280
Let's share it together.

106
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:14,280
Of course.

107
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:17,080
It's for Uncle Buddha.

108
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:20,480
Uncle Buddha is here.

109
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:22,880
Uncle Buddha.

110
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:25,080
Congratulations.

111
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:26,080
Boss Lou.

112
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:27,880
Uncle Buddha.

113
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:28,880
You are messing around.

114
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:29,880
You can't make a move

115
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:31,080
without Uncle Buddha's words.

116
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:32,880
So you know

117
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:34,880
that Uncle Buddha is here.

118
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:37,680
Uncle Buddha.

119
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:39,480
The new team leader's choice

120
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:41,080
means...

121
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:47,080
Let's welcome the new team leader.

122
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:57,080
The new team leader's choice means...

123
00:04:57,080 --> 00:04:59,080
The new team leader's choice means...

124
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:17,880
Uncle Buddha.

125
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:18,880
Sister Zhang.

126
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:21,880
Brother.

127
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:27,080
From today on,

128
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:30,280
Sang Tuo is your new team leader.

129
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:31,880
Call Brother Sang.

130
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:43,080
Brother Sang.

131
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:44,080
Brother Sang.

132
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:57,080
They all

133
00:05:57,080 --> 00:05:58,080
were sent out?

134
00:05:58,080 --> 00:05:59,080
Yes.

135
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:01,480
Ba Sihai, He Guidong,

136
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:03,080
Nezha and Tie Fuo

137
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:05,080
are the core members of the fraud organization.

138
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:06,880
Especially Tie Fuo.

139
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:08,080
His original name is Cai Huaping.

140
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:09,080
He is from Guangdong.

141
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:10,680
His family all emigrated to Dongbang.

142
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:12,480
He was the manager of the original district.

143
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:14,080
He killed the owner of the original district

144
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:15,480
and took the position two years ago.

145
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:20,480
The one who was killed was Suo Bangquan.

146
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:23,080
He controlled the largest fraud zone in Dongbang.

147
00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:24,280
He was the leader of the gang.

148
00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:25,680
He was very cruel.

149
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:27,480
Tie Fuo killed him.

150
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:29,480
I heard he ran away with a son.

151
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:31,880
Tie Fuo also chased after him in Dongbang.

152
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:33,080
But he didn't find anyone.

153
00:06:33,080 --> 00:06:34,280
I don't know where he went.

154
00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:40,480
Uncle.

155
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:42,680
He is a big bastard.

156
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:45,080
He is also a big bastard when he came to the second floor.

157
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:46,080
Why?

158
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:47,480
Why did he come to the second floor?

159
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:48,480
Brother.

160
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:50,280
The truth is,

161
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:52,280
he is the one who killed the owner of the first floor.

162
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:54,080
A real hero is born.

163
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:57,280
Since Uncle Fuo is willing to give me this chance,

164
00:06:59,080 --> 00:07:00,480
why can't I?

165
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:04,480
How many cases can you open in Erlang?

166
00:07:05,080 --> 00:07:07,080
How many basic fraudulent methods are there?

167
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:08,280
You can't even figure it out.

168
00:07:08,280 --> 00:07:10,280
There are many fraudulent methods.

169
00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:11,480
If you are a man,

170
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:13,280
we can use the way of asking your sister to invite you in

171
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:14,680
and let you pay the insurance.

172
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:15,880
If you are a woman,

173
00:07:15,880 --> 00:07:19,280
we can say that you bought a fake product after online shopping.

174
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:20,680
If you want to make money,

175
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:23,480
we can use the investment to open a store to invite you in.

176
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:24,680
If you are a child,

177
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:26,280
it will be easier.

178
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:29,680
We will sell the game accounts on the related platforms

179
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:31,080
and let you enter the online market.

180
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:32,480
Brother.

181
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:35,480
Those methods are too outdated.

182
00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:36,880
Too stupid.

183
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:42,280
I am stupid?

184
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:44,480
Okay.

185
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:46,280
You are a man of faith.

186
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:47,680
Come on.

187
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:51,280
If we want to make money like you,

188
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:56,080
we only need to grasp the bottom line of human nature.

189
00:07:57,480 --> 00:07:59,280
But if we want to make big money,

190
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:02,880
we need to know the big picture of the economy.

191
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:06,080
For the past one or two years,

192
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:08,280
the economy in China has been not good.

193
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:10,680
Everyone can't make money even if they invest.

194
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:13,680
Everyone is keeping their wallet tightly.

195
00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:15,880
If we want to cheat now,

196
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:18,480
we need to rely on the foreign money.

197
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:20,880
Foreign monks are so smart.

198
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:24,080
The situation in the Middle East and America is good these years.

199
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:27,680
The people in China will only think that the future abroad is bright.

200
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:29,680
They can't see the fatigue.

201
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:35,080
He is good at talking.

202
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:37,880
Can you say something specific?

203
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:40,080
Okay.

204
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:42,480
If you want to immigrate,

205
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:45,080
we will pretend to be the middlemen.

206
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:47,680
We will cheat their whole family first.

207
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:49,080
With this money,

208
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:51,280
we can earn 8 to 120 thousand dollars.

209
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:55,280
When they are innocent,

210
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:00,680
we will pretend to be local governments

211
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:02,480
and local gangs

212
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:05,080
to blow up the remaining value.

213
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:06,880
Those who want to study abroad

214
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:08,880
will be the middlemen.

215
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:11,480
It's easier to study abroad.

216
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:13,880
We can open a fake school.

217
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:18,480
All the students will be my hostage.

218
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:20,880
When will I let them make money?

219
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:23,480
When will their parents give me money?

220
00:09:26,280 --> 00:09:27,480
In addition,

221
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:29,440
there are also the loan sharks,

222
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:30,520
monkeys,

223
00:09:30,520 --> 00:09:32,080
love, gambling,

224
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:33,680
and so on.

225
00:09:34,280 --> 00:09:36,880
Those who are rich and rich

226
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:39,080
and those who want to transfer assets

227
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:40,680
will be the middlemen.

228
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:43,880
This is the big deal.

229
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:50,280
Okay.

230
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:52,880
Black is black.

231
00:09:54,280 --> 00:09:56,080
I'm afraid of eating my stomach.

232
00:09:57,080 --> 00:09:58,280
Brother Hai.

233
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:01,480
How can this be considered black?

234
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:03,080
You don't know, do you?

235
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:05,280
Most people don't take bribes

236
00:10:05,280 --> 00:10:08,080
for real money.

237
00:10:09,280 --> 00:10:11,280
They only do it for a dream,

238
00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:13,280
a beautiful dream.

239
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:15,280
Those who buy diamonds

240
00:10:15,280 --> 00:10:17,280
are for a hundred years.

241
00:10:17,280 --> 00:10:19,280
Those who love to calculate the eight characters

242
00:10:19,280 --> 00:10:21,680
are just for the hope of escaping the bad luck.

243
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:24,280
We are also making a dream.

244
00:10:24,280 --> 00:10:25,480
We are making a dream

245
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:27,080
that will make those people

246
00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:28,280
think they can change their destiny

247
00:10:28,280 --> 00:10:30,680
after they go abroad.

248
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:33,080
Everyone,

249
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:35,680
we have been through enough.

250
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:39,280
We just made some sugar

251
00:10:39,280 --> 00:10:41,480
and then sold it.

252
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:46,080
It's okay to earn some more money.

253
00:10:53,880 --> 00:10:55,280
Brother Hai.

254
00:10:55,280 --> 00:10:56,480
My method of doing business

255
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:58,880
is too difficult for you.

256
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:01,960
Your Majesty, you are too over-exaggerated.

257
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:03,280
If you can't learn it,

258
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:05,240
my suggestion is

259
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:07,520
you can use 13th Brother.

260
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:10,080
You should use

261
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:11,600
a talented man like him.

262
00:11:17,160 --> 00:11:17,920
Uncle Bo,

263
00:11:19,160 --> 00:11:21,040
I can help Sister Zha

264
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:23,360
to rebuild the water room as soon as possible.

265
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:28,440
Good.

266
00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:31,560
Thank you, Uncle Bo.

267
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:42,240
Brother,

268
00:11:42,760 --> 00:11:44,320
I did well just now, right?

269
00:11:44,680 --> 00:11:46,720
I've been memorizing the lines for a whole night.

270
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:47,600
When I was speaking,

271
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:48,880
my legs were straight.

272
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:51,000
Look, my hands are sweating.

273
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:51,960
I don't even know why...

274
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:52,920
Why are you the leader?

275
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:54,400
Why are you the leader?

276
00:11:54,640 --> 00:11:55,160
Brother,

277
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:56,400
you can't turn back

278
00:11:56,400 --> 00:11:57,440
if you know you are the leader.

279
00:11:57,480 --> 00:11:58,160
You can't turn back

280
00:11:58,160 --> 00:11:59,160
if you know you are the leader.

281
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:01,720
None of the tricks you just said

282
00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:03,440
will work.

283
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:05,640
Go to Tie Fu

284
00:12:05,880 --> 00:12:07,040
and give up the position of the leader.

285
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:07,680
Why?

286
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:09,000
Go!

287
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:10,480
Go now!

288
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:11,120
Why?

289
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:13,840
What did you say?

290
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:15,800
Why?

291
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:17,000
Why should I ask you?

292
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:22,120
I just want to be the leader.

293
00:12:22,760 --> 00:12:24,520
You don't want to be the leader. I want to be the leader.

294
00:12:25,520 --> 00:12:27,480
Why should others think I can't be the leader?

295
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:28,680
Just because you don't like it?

296
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:31,000
Yes.

297
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:32,960
You saved me before.

298
00:12:33,280 --> 00:12:34,280
I'm grateful.

299
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:36,360
But can you save me once?

300
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:37,240
Can you save me twice?

301
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:38,160
Three times?

302
00:12:38,920 --> 00:12:41,160
The reason we are bullied here

303
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:43,240
is because we don't have a position or a backer.

304
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:45,240
Now you don't like it

305
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:46,120
and you want me to step down.

306
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:47,840
Do you know how much I've paid

307
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:48,680
to be the leader?

308
00:12:48,680 --> 00:12:49,880
Have you forgotten?

309
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:53,840
Your family was killed by those frauds.

310
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:56,240
Do you want to be like them?

311
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:56,880
Brother.

312
00:12:59,040 --> 00:12:59,960
Ask yourself.

313
00:12:59,960 --> 00:13:01,200
In this environment,

314
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,400
can you be a good person?

315
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:06,520
My parents and my brother

316
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:09,400
were killed by them.

317
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:11,760
I was not capable before

318
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:13,560
and I couldn't protect them.

319
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:15,760
But now it's different.

320
00:13:16,040 --> 00:13:17,080
I have a chance.

321
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:19,120
If I become the leader,

322
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:20,800
I can avenge my parents.

323
00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:22,680
I can protect Rui.

324
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:25,200
I can protect you.

325
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:29,800
Even if it becomes the same as them,

326
00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:32,360
I'm willing to do it.

327
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:41,000
Sang Dong.

328
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:43,440
I know you want to avenge them.

329
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:46,480
But you can't put yourself in a dead end.

330
00:13:50,040 --> 00:13:51,320
I said I would save you.

331
00:13:52,920 --> 00:13:54,120
Trust me.

332
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:57,680
Brother.

333
00:13:59,080 --> 00:14:00,120
I believe you.

334
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:03,680
But I must be

335
00:14:05,640 --> 00:14:06,680
the leader.

336
00:14:07,280 --> 00:14:08,840
Are you listening to me?

337
00:14:08,840 --> 00:14:09,920
I'm listening.

338
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,000
Listen.

339
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:14,480
If I don't become the leader today,

340
00:14:14,840 --> 00:14:17,160
Tie Fu will choose between you and Ba Si Hai.

341
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:20,040
He was suspicious.

342
00:14:20,440 --> 00:14:21,800
If you take the throne,

343
00:14:21,840 --> 00:14:24,440
he will pick a fight between you and Ba Si Hai.

344
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:25,920
If it's Ba Si Hai,

345
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:28,040
it will also cause Tie Fu's suspicion.

346
00:14:28,840 --> 00:14:31,840
What if Tie Fu doesn't allow him to continue to run the pig farm?

347
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:33,920
Our efforts will be in vain.

348
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:35,360
I'd rather work hard than waste.

349
00:14:35,560 --> 00:14:37,120
I'd rather do it again.

350
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:39,360
I don't want to see you

351
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:41,600
become a complete liar.

352
00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:48,400
Complete liar?

353
00:14:52,760 --> 00:14:54,320
I've done so much for you.

354
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:56,240
In your eyes,

355
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:58,680
I'm a complete liar.

356
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:01,680
Fine.

357
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:03,280
You're so capable.

358
00:15:03,280 --> 00:15:04,880
How dare you say that about Tie Fu?

359
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:05,400
Come on.

360
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:06,600
Hit me.

361
00:15:07,280 --> 00:15:08,040
Hit me to death.

362
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:09,120
I can't be the leader.

363
00:15:10,080 --> 00:15:11,320
Brother Dong.

364
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:11,920
Brother.

365
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:13,520
What are you going to do?

366
00:15:20,680 --> 00:15:21,640
Fine.

367
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:24,320
You're both good people.

368
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:26,720
You're bad people.

369
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:30,040
Han Shang, let me tell you.

370
00:15:31,160 --> 00:15:32,360
From now on,

371
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:37,280
you're the saint.

372
00:15:38,120 --> 00:15:39,720
I'm the liar.

373
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:43,120
We'll be in heaven.

374
00:16:43,260 --> 00:16:45,860
The Next Day

375
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:06,440
redundancy made holes

376
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:09,780
The whole trackHeard

377
00:17:09,780 --> 00:17:12,780
I'm afraid that I can't be with you.

378
00:17:12,780 --> 00:17:15,780
I'm afraid that I can't be with you.

379
00:17:15,780 --> 00:17:18,780
I'm afraid that I can't be with you.

380
00:17:18,780 --> 00:17:21,780
