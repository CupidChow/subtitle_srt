This is the remains of An Ning.

00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Please accept my condolences.

00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
You're here.

17
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Brother Lu, we've heard about your family.

18
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,000
I'm sorry to bother you.

19
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
It's okay.

20
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,000
He just can't get over it.

21
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
You have to hold on, Lao Zheng.

22
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
If you need any help,

23
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
please let me know.

24
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Don't worry.

25
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Look, it's empty.

26
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
I'll move it in a few days.

27
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Smell the smoke.

28
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Where's the fire?

29
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Lao Zheng, don't worry.

30
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Stop looking.

31
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
It's okay.

32
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
I just used it.

33
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Don't worry.

34
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Don't worry.

35
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
You used it.

36
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Lao Zheng, it's okay.

37
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Stop looking.

38
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,000
It's empty.

39
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Lao Zheng, don't worry.

40
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
I'll move it in a few days.

41
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Lao Zheng, are you okay?

42
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
I'm fine.

43
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Are you okay?

44
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Take me back.

45
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Lao Zheng.

46
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,000
I can't take care of myself.

47
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
I'm fine.

48
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Take me back.

49
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Take care of me.

50
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,000
The color of the sky is red.

51
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
The fire is burning.

52
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
I'm fine.

53
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
I'm fine.

54
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
I'm fine.

55
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:44,000
I'm locked in the storm with you.

56
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:51,000
I'm floating in the dust.

57
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:54,000
The balance of the waves.

58
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:57,000
The whirlpool above.

59
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:07,000
It's never been clouded.

60
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Okay.

61
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:54,000
The light is always on

62
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:00,400
How dare you come here?

63
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:01,200
It's all your fault

64
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:02,000
Since you came here

65
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,000
my family has been in trouble

66
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:03,800
It's all because of you

67
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:05,000
Don't be so crazy

68
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,200
I was cheated

69
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:08,600
I have no money to make these years

70
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:10,200
You blame me

71
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:11,600
I really have a problem with you

72
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:12,400
Bullshit

73
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:15,000
The police said you are a liar

74
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:17,600
The police are taking revenge on me

75
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:18,800
If you go to the police station

76
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:20,200
like yesterday

77
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:22,000
you will be like me

78
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,200
I came here today to remind you

79
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,200
Don't be so crazy

80
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:41,600
These years

81
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:44,200
you have fought with the police

82
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:48,400
I was cheated last year

83
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:51,600
They said my sister found her

84
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:54,600
She cheated me 100,000

85
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:56,800
I called the police

86
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:01,400
It was the police officer of Han

87
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:05,200
The liar was caught

88
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,000
but told me that

89
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,200
he couldn't get the 100,000 back

90
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,400
I am straightforward

91
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,400
I said I would sue her

92
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:17,400
I would sue her and sue her

93
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:19,600
I went to her

94
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:22,000
and she was offended

95
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:24,400
This time

96
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:28,200
I wanted to submit the material

97
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:30,000
and say I wanted to investigate her

98
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:32,600
But I didn't expect

99
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,800
she would arrest me directly

100
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,400
I was afraid

101
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:38,400
so I ran away

102
00:08:39,800 --> 00:08:42,000
She gave me

103
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,600
many unnecessary charges

104
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:47,600
She said I used my sister to get sympathy

105
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:49,000
She said I was cheating

106
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:55,200
To be honest

107
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
we are all strangers

108
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:00,800
Do you think

109
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:04,800
I would use my sister

110
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:07,400
to do such a despicable thing?

111
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:12,200
She can give me any charges

112
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:13,800
I don't care

113
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:16,800
But if I go in

114
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:20,000
what about my sister?

115
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:43,000
You don't want to live here?

116
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:46,200
You were too impulsive just now

117
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:47,200
I am sorry

118
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:52,800
It doesn't matter

119
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:56,800
These people

120
00:09:58,200 --> 00:10:00,200
we small people can't offend them

121
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:16,200
You really dare to answer the phone?

122
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:18,000
You are so cold

123
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:19,000
I am telling you

124
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:20,400
I am not afraid of you

125
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:21,400
You do this

126
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:23,000
to seek retribution

127
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:24,600
You are not capable of doing this to me

128
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:26,600
so you expect retribution

129
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,200
I am calling you today

130
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:29,400
to give you a step

131
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:30,600
to make you surrender

132
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,800
If you make trouble with them again

133
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:35,200
you will be the same as Zheng Jiahe's wife

134
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:38,200
I am not afraid of you

135
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:39,200
I am not afraid of you

136
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:40,200
I am not afraid of you

137
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:41,200
I am not afraid of you

138
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:42,200
I am not afraid of you

139
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:43,200
I am not afraid of you

140
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:45,000
Han Chuan

141
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,000
What do you mean?

142
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,400
What is the same as my wife?

143
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:49,600
Did you kill my wife?

144
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:50,600
Tell me, is it true?

145
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,000
Listen

146
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,000
Don't be so stubborn

147
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:54,600
When you were making trouble yesterday

148
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:55,600
I was watching you

149
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:57,800
Do you think you can beat me?

150
00:10:58,200 --> 00:10:59,400
I am telling you

151
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:01,200
your wife jumped into the river

152
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:02,600
to teach you a lesson

153
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,000
Han Chuan

154
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:05,600
you pay my wife's life

155
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:07,000
you pay my wife's life

156
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:08,200
I will kill you

157
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:09,400
Kill me?

158
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:11,600
I will let you never find your child

159
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:12,600
Say it again

160
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:13,800
Say it again

161
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,000
You killed my wife

162
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,000
Don't be so impulsive

163
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,000
I like you

164
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,000
I will kill you

165
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,000
Han Chuan

166
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
I will kill you, Han Chuan

167
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:43,600
Master

168
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:45,600
We have checked all the surveillance cameras

169
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,000
We found some places

170
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,600
where Sang Tuo may be hiding

171
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:50,200
We are sending people to search for him

172
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:51,200
Okay

173
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:51,600
Wu Ju

174
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:52,600
Captain An

175
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:53,800
Zheng Xia is still in the center of the operation

176
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:54,800
to intercept the hostage

177
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:55,800
and invite Han Chuan

178
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,000
And

179
00:11:57,400 --> 00:11:58,600
He has a bomb on him

180
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:08,400
Calm down

181
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:09,400
Don't panic

182
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:10,400
Don't panic

183
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:11,400
Calm down

184
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:12,400
Don't panic

185
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:13,400
Back off

186
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:14,400
Back off

187
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:15,400
Calm down

188
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:16,400
Back off

189
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:17,400
Back off

190
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:19,400
Back off

191
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:20,400
Thank you

192
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:21,400
Back off

193
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:22,400
Calm down

194
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:23,400
Back off

195
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:24,400
Back off

196
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:27,400
Don't move

197
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:28,400
Master

198
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:31,400
Where is Han Chuan?

199
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:33,400
I want to find Han Chuan

200
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:34,400
Bring Han Chuan here

201
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:35,400
I want to see him

202
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:42,400
Come on

203
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:43,400
Move away

204
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:44,400
Move away

205
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:47,400
Don't move

206
00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:50,400
Zheng Xia He

207
00:12:50,400 --> 00:12:51,400
Calm down

208
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:52,400
Tell us what you need

209
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:53,400
We can figure it out

210
00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:54,400
Don't be so agitated

211
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:55,400
He

212
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:56,400
killed my wife

213
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:57,400
and cheated me

214
00:12:57,400 --> 00:12:58,400
I want him to pay for it

215
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:05,400
Okay

216
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:08,400
Let go of the hostage

217
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:09,400
I will pay you

218
00:13:09,400 --> 00:13:10,400
Han Chuan

219
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:11,400
Don't move

220
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:16,400
Han Chuan

221
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:17,400
Don't move

222
00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:18,400
I said, don't come over

223
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:20,400
Don't move

224
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:22,400
I have nothing

225
00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:24,400
Look

226
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:32,400
I said, don't move

227
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:33,400
I will press it

228
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:34,400
Okay

229
00:13:34,400 --> 00:13:35,400
I won't move

230
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:37,400
I won't move

231
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:41,400
Why did you kill my wife?

232
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:43,400
I killed your wife

233
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:44,400
Yes

234
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:45,400
You said it yourself

235
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:48,400
Last time I went to the police station

236
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:49,400
You hated me

237
00:13:49,400 --> 00:13:50,400
You punished me

238
00:13:51,400 --> 00:13:52,400
You killed my wife and me

239
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:55,400
You went to the police station

240
00:13:55,400 --> 00:13:56,400
So many people

241
00:13:56,400 --> 00:13:57,400
Why did you target me?

242
00:13:57,400 --> 00:13:58,400
Why? Why?

243
00:13:58,400 --> 00:13:59,400
Zheng Xia He

244
00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:02,400
I never said that

245
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:05,400
I saw it with my own eyes

246
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:07,400
I will kill you

247
00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:08,400
Don't be so agitated

248
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:09,400
I am very agitated

249
00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:10,400
I may shoot him at any time

250
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:11,400
I can't die

251
00:14:11,400 --> 00:14:12,400
You die

252
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:13,400
Calm down

253
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:14,400
Don't destroy yourself

254
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:15,400
because of your own will

255
00:14:15,400 --> 00:14:16,400
I can't calm down

256
00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:19,400
You bully me again and again

257
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:21,400
I can't live

258
00:14:21,400 --> 00:14:22,400
We die together

259
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:24,400
We all die together

260
00:14:39,400 --> 00:14:41,400
You simply let me go

261
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:44,400
There is nothing I can do

262
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:46,400
You want to finish your work

263
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:47,400
Can you check the records?

264
00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:48,400
Forget it

265
00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:50,400
What's the difference?

266
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:53,400
Are you afraid of being so scary?

267
00:14:53,400 --> 00:14:54,060
Go get the movie

268
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:01,400
The pillow

269
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:03,400
Many strips

270
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:04,400
Two of these

271
00:15:04,900 --> 00:15:06,900
is my best friend

272
00:15:06,900 --> 00:15:07,900
It's yours

273
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:09,400
