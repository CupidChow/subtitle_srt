1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,840
They're gonna kill me.

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,000
What?

3
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,000
It's all right.

4
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,000
You can go back now.

5
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,000
All right.

6
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,000
We'll meet again.

7
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,000
I'll go out first.

8
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,000
All right.

9
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:38,000
I'll wait for you there.

10
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Thank you.

11
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Bye.

12
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Bye.

13
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Bye.

14
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Bye.

15
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Bye.

16
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Bye.

17
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Bye.

18
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Bye.

19
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Bye.

20
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Bye.

21
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Bye.

22
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Bye.

23
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Bye.

24
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Bye.

25
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Bye.

26
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Bye.

27
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Bye.

28
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Bye.

29
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Bye.

30
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Bye.

31
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,400
After you go out,

32
00:01:00,400 --> 00:01:02,400
contact this number.

33
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,200
Who is this?

34
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:10,400
His name is Da'an.

35
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:12,400
He's my hair stylist and a police officer.

36
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:13,400
After you go out,

37
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:15,400
he'll arrange a hospital and a place to stay.

38
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:17,000
Okay.

39
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,200
Remember,

40
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:20,600
all the phones on the ship have a monitor.

41
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:22,000
You can only send short messages,

42
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,200
not phone calls.

43
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:24,200
By then,

44
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:26,200
just send the codes on it.

45
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:28,000
What do these codes mean?

46
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:30,800
Da'an has a code for police communication.

47
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:32,200
I learned it before.

48
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:34,200
The codes on it probably mean

49
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:35,800
you're Sang Tuo's friend,

50
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:38,400
and you need a hospital and a place to stay.

51
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:40,000
Once you get the code,

52
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,000
you'll think it's a system error and won't be saved.

53
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:47,200
Thank you.

54
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:53,000
Brother.

55
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:02,000
I don't know how long I can hide this from you.

56
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,400
When Tie Fu finds out that I helped you escape,

57
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:07,400
he'll kill me.

58
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Brother.

59
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,000
You must come back with the police as soon as possible.

60
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
I'll be waiting for you.

61
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:31,040
But I don't know when.

62
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:47,040
Where is our stunжmode?

63
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Hey, Uncle Fu is here. What are you doing?

64
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Uncle Fu,

65
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:12,000
locate the ship. Hurry.

66
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Uncle Fu,

67
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:18,000
all the mobile phone locations have been lost.

68
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:24,000
The ship, killing people, taking people away,

69
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
in such a short time,

70
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,000
he can't do so many things alone.

71
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:32,000
He's not a good person.

72
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,000
He's a good person.

73
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:38,000
He's a good person.

74
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:42,000
In such a short time, he can't do so many things alone.

75
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Someone must be helping him.

76
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Hurry and check all the surveillance cameras in the building.

77
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Yes.

78
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Xiaoxiao, we're here.

79
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Xiaoxiao.

80
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Han Cheon, Xiaoxiao fainted.

81
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Xiaoxiao, wake up.

82
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Don't scare me.

83
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Han Cheon.

84
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Han Cheon.

85
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Shi Shan.

86
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Officer An, my sister is now...

87
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
The hospital has contacted them. Let's go.

88
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
The rest is on the way.

89
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Uncle Fu,

90
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
the surveillance cameras in the building have been lost.

91
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Shi Shan and Tao Hua's video of that time

92
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
has been leaked by the guards.

93
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:36,000
The Han brothers have informed us.

94
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,000
Shi Shan is now in the Bangli Hospital.

95
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:42,000
They've already sent someone to look for him.

96
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Han Cheon.

97
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Come here.

98
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Come here.

99
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:50,000
I didn't think that the Iron Talisman would be so powerful.

100
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
It's a relief that you found them earlier.

101
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Otherwise, it would be a problem.

102
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:57,000
But don't worry. I've already contacted the police.

103
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
None of them can escape.

104
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Thank you.

105
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Doctor, is my sister's surgery successful?

106
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:06,000
Her surgery was successful. She's fine now.

107
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
She'll be fine in a few days.

108
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
Thank you.

109
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Since your sister is out of danger,

110
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
we should talk about you.

111
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
I heard that you were with the Chinese driver

112
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
and he's going to the police station with us.

113
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
Okay.

114
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
Officer Han, I'm sorry.

115
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:44,000
We just contacted the Chinese police

116
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
and verified your identity.

117
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
I'm sorry for being a nuisance.

118
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
It's okay.

119
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
I didn't hide the identity of the police.

120
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:56,000
We're all police. I understand.

121
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:59,000
Officer Dan, can I use your phone to make a call?

122
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
Of course.

123
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
Please come in.

124
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
Thank you.

125
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
Hello?

126
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
Hello?

127
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
It's me.

128
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
Han Che.

129
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
I'm sorry.

130
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
I'm sorry.

131
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
I'm sorry.

132
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
I'm sorry.

133
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
I'm sorry.

134
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
I'm sorry.

135
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Han Che.

136
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
It's really you.

137
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
What's wrong?

138
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
You sound worried about me.

139
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
It's okay.

140
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
It's okay.

141
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000
Hello?

142
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
The Chinese police are here.

143
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
It's okay.

144
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
The Chinese police are here.

145
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
They found the driver.

146
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
You go inside.

147
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
Yes.

148
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
According to Han Che's lead

149
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
from a life-threatening source

150
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
we basically know

151
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
the location

152
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,600
the location of the bomb and the personnel.

153
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:47,520
The Ministry of Security has decided to implement

154
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:50,400
the highest-ranking court, the highest-ranking procuratorate,

155
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:54,320
and the Ministry of Security's opinion on the use of legal evidence

156
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:56,680
for the use of telecommunication fraud cases.

157
00:09:56,680 --> 00:09:58,120
The document requirements

158
00:09:58,120 --> 00:10:01,560
will be used to combat the bombings in the telecommunication fraud groups

159
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:02,360
in the eastern region.

160
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:05,120
The 118th Special Major Trans-Taiwan Electric Fragment Project

161
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:08,600
will formally send a request to the eastern police.

162
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:10,040
Our mission this time is,

163
00:10:10,040 --> 00:10:13,800
first, to safely bring Han Chuan and Han Xiaoxiao back to the country.

164
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:16,720
Second, we will actively cooperate with the local police

165
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:18,280
to destroy this fraud group

166
00:10:18,280 --> 00:10:20,200
and bring all the telecommunication fraud personnel

167
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:21,760
from China back.

168
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:23,640
I order Comrade An Fei as the leader

169
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:25,640
to lead Yang Yang and Wang Yaqi,

170
00:10:25,640 --> 00:10:28,120
and go abroad officially three days later.

171
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:29,120
Yes!

172
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:34,840
Hello, Chief of the Security Department. Han Chuan.

173
00:10:34,840 --> 00:10:36,880
Han Jin Kong, thank you for your hard work.

174
00:10:36,920 --> 00:10:40,120
We've been trying to destroy this fraud group for a long time.

175
00:10:40,120 --> 00:10:42,360
But we never got a breakthrough.

176
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:44,560
Thank goodness we have you.

177
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:46,160
This is what I should do.

178
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:47,880
I just got the documents.

179
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:49,920
The joint operation of the eastern and China

180
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:52,400
against the fraud group

181
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:54,120
has been approved.

182
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:55,120
That's great.

183
00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:00,520
I order Chief of the Security Department

184
00:11:00,520 --> 00:11:02,160
to lead this operation

185
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:03,960
and cooperate with the Chinese police

186
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:05,800
to completely destroy the fraud group.

187
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:06,800
Yes!

188
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:09,080
I order Chief of the Security Department

189
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:11,080
to lead this operation

190
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:13,080
and cooperate with the Chinese police

191
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:15,080
to completely destroy the fraud group.

192
00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:16,080
Yes!

193
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:18,080
I order Chief of the Security Department

194
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:20,080
to lead this operation

195
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:22,080
and cooperate with the Chinese police

196
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:24,080
to completely destroy the fraud group.

197
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:25,080
Yes!

198
00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:27,080
I order Chief of the Security Department

199
00:11:27,080 --> 00:11:29,080
to lead this operation

200
00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:31,080
and cooperate with the Chinese police

201
00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:33,080
to completely destroy the fraud group.

202
00:11:33,080 --> 00:11:34,080
Yes!

203
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:36,080
I order Chief of the Security Department

204
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,080
to lead this operation

205
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:40,080
and cooperate with the Chinese police

206
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:42,080
to completely destroy the fraud group.

207
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:43,080
Yes!

208
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:45,200
I order Chief of the Security Department

209
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:47,200
to lead this operation

210
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:49,200
and cooperate with the Chinese police

211
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:50,080
to completely destroy the fraud group.

212
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:51,080
Yes!

213
00:11:51,080 --> 00:11:53,080
I order Chief of the Security Department

214
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:54,080
to lead this operation

215
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:56,720
and cooperate with the Chinese police

216
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:58,680
to completely destroy the fraud group.

217
00:11:58,680 --> 00:11:59,680
Yes!

218
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:02,680
I order Chief of the Security Department

219
00:12:32,680 --> 00:12:33,960
The suspect in the water house

220
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:35,480
has a key clue.

221
00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:37,600
There's a middle-end server in the park.

222
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:39,200
There are six black boxes.

223
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:41,000
Every coin they fraudulently stole

224
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,120
and all the transactions

225
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:43,880
will be stored in this black box.

226
00:12:43,880 --> 00:12:45,280
The police told us

227
00:12:45,280 --> 00:12:46,280
to protect this important evidence

228
00:12:46,280 --> 00:12:48,240
during this operation.

229
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:49,360
Without evidence,

230
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:50,880
we can't catch them

231
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:53,160
or get them back.

232
00:12:53,160 --> 00:12:54,480
Okay, I understand.

233
00:12:57,320 --> 00:12:58,320
Officer Han.

234
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:00,240
There are emergency situations.

235
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:02,000
Let me pick you up.

236
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:04,840
Don't worry.

237
00:13:09,520 --> 00:13:10,440
If I hadn't recoveredимость

238
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:11,960
as we speak,

239
00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:19,680
you would have got

240
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:21,720
dug pleasant for Sang Tuo

241
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:23,840
and drawn him out to get revenge.

242
00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:25,000
Why?

243
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,280
You are beyond doubt.

244
00:13:26,280 --> 00:13:27,000
Brother.

245
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:30,000
I'm not going to let you get away with this.

246
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,000
I'm not going to let you get away with this.

247
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,000
You're not going to get away with this.

248
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,000
I'm not going to let you get away with this.

249
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,000
I'm not going to let you get away with this.

250
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,000
Officer An, what's going on?

251
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,000
Aren't we supposed to be on the day after tomorrow?

252
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,000
There's an emergency on the island.

253
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,000
We have to act early.

254
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,000
Get to work!

255
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,000
Since we knew where the island is,

256
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:03,000
we've been keeping an eye on the eastern border.

257
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,000
This morning, a message came from the tongue.

258
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,000
Tie Fu is running away.

259
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,000
I think he knows you've escaped.

260
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:12,000
And he knows your identity as a cop.

261
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
I don't know how long I can hide it from him.

262
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:21,000
Tie Fu will kill me if he finds out I helped you escape.

263
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,000
Officer An,

264
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,000
the situation is sudden.

265
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,000
We've prepared well.

266
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,000
Let's go.

267
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,000
Get on the boat.

268
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,000
It's this Sang Tuo.

269
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
He helped Shi San escape.

270
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:00,000
His loyalty was fake.

271
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:03,000
He fooled us all.

272
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
Today, let's see

273
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:11,000
how he will end up betraying the Buddhist books and Yuan Qu.

274
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,000
I'm sorry.

275
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
When I saw you last time,

276
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:35,000
I thought you looked like an old friend.

277
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:42,000
I didn't expect you to be his slave.

278
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:45,000
Even the back bone of your head

279
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:50,000
is as high as your father's.

280
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:57,000
I'll kill you if I have a chance.

281
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,000
Good.

282
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:07,000
Let's see how long your army can last.

283
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:59,000
The clouds are entangled in the wind and waves.

284
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:06,000
They float in the dust.

285
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:09,000
The waves are in the balance.

286
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:13,000
The whirlpool is in the sky.

287
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:23,000
The dawn never falls.
