1
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:13,760
What are you doing?

2
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:14,760
Are you asleep again?

3
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:15,760
No, I'm not.

4
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:16,760
Wake up!

5
00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:17,760
Okay.

6
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:21,580
Put me down!

7
00:04:27,580 --> 00:04:29,580
Where are we going?

8
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:42,160
Turå‘¢?

9
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:47,440
Scribble.

10
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:48,760
I'm here.

11
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:54,760
You must be Xiaoxiao's roommate.

12
00:05:55,760 --> 00:05:56,760
Where is Xiaoxiao?

13
00:06:02,760 --> 00:06:03,760
You are Xiaoxiao's brother.

14
00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:05,760
I saw the picture. How did you...

15
00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:06,760
Shut up!

16
00:06:15,760 --> 00:06:16,760
The police are here.

17
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:19,760
If you insist, I will call the police.

18
00:06:20,760 --> 00:06:21,760
Wait.

19
00:06:23,760 --> 00:06:24,760
Now...

20
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:27,760
If you can't get out, it's useless to untie me.

21
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:30,760
If they find out, they will beat me to death.

22
00:06:38,760 --> 00:06:39,760
Where is Xiaoxiao?

23
00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:40,760
Xiaoxiao.

24
00:06:45,760 --> 00:06:47,760
Then take her to the grave.

25
00:06:49,760 --> 00:06:51,760
I don't know where Xiaoxiao is.

26
00:06:52,760 --> 00:06:54,760
We were separated when we were caught.

27
00:06:58,760 --> 00:07:00,760
What did they do to you after you came in?

28
00:07:01,760 --> 00:07:02,760
They used the software we researched.

29
00:07:03,760 --> 00:07:04,760
They were disobedient and they blamed us.

30
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:06,760
You must protect yourself.

31
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:08,760
I will call you out when I find Xiaoxiao.

32
00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:10,760
It's so dark here.

33
00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:13,760
How can you take us away alone?

34
00:07:22,760 --> 00:07:23,760
Hide yourself.

35
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:40,760
I will kill you.

36
00:07:58,760 --> 00:08:00,760
I don't even lock the door.

37
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:05,760
Brother, why are you here?

38
00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:08,760
I told them to take care of me.

39
00:08:08,760 --> 00:08:10,760
What kind of care?

40
00:08:12,760 --> 00:08:14,760
Nezha is a woman.

41
00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:16,760
She doesn't know how to practice Western medicine.

42
00:08:18,760 --> 00:08:19,760
Does it hurt?

43
00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:25,760
Brother, can you help me talk to Sister Zha?

44
00:08:25,760 --> 00:08:26,760
Please help me.

45
00:08:27,760 --> 00:08:28,760
Don't mention that woman.

46
00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:30,760
I brought her here.

47
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:33,760
She didn't even give me a chance to talk to her.

48
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:35,760
But don't worry.

49
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:39,760
After you become my wife, I will take you out.

50
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:45,760
Brother.

51
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:47,760
What's wrong?

52
00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:49,760
You didn't bring enough?

53
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:54,760
Brother, I'm afraid you will be seen by the security guards.

54
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:56,760
It's hard to explain.

55
00:08:57,760 --> 00:08:58,760
Don't be afraid.

56
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:01,760
They are all out there.

57
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:04,760
Today, you made me feel comfortable.

58
00:09:04,760 --> 00:09:06,760
I will make you feel comfortable every day.

59
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:14,760
Brother.

60
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:18,760
Who is it?

61
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:21,760
Brother, the security guards ran out.

62
00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:26,760
That woman is a bitch.

63
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:27,760
She was watching me.

64
00:09:28,760 --> 00:09:30,760
That bitch was watching me.

65
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:32,760
She wants to catch me.

66
00:09:34,760 --> 00:09:35,760
Don't be afraid.

67
00:09:36,760 --> 00:09:37,760
I will take you out one day.

68
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:48,760
Wait for me.

69
00:09:57,760 --> 00:09:58,760
Wait for me.

70
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:08,760
Daqiu.

71
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:10,760
Daqiu.

72
00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:11,760
Watch carefully.

73
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:12,760
We are just one cup.

74
00:10:12,760 --> 00:10:13,760
I will fill it up for you.

75
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:15,760
I really can't drink anymore, Brother Rui.

76
00:10:16,760 --> 00:10:19,760
I...I still have to go to work.

77
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:22,760
Slow down.

78
00:10:22,760 --> 00:10:23,760
I have to go to work.

79
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:24,760
You don't want to drink anymore?

80
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:26,760
Slow down.

81
00:10:30,760 --> 00:10:31,760
Where is my clothes?

82
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:35,760
Your clothes...

83
00:10:36,760 --> 00:10:37,760
She probably...

84
00:10:40,760 --> 00:10:41,760
Did you see my clothes?

85
00:10:46,760 --> 00:10:47,760
I asked you where my clothes were.

86
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:57,760
I asked you if you saw my clothes.

87
00:10:58,760 --> 00:11:00,760
Daqiu, I remember you left your clothes outside.

88
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:01,760
Let's go find them.

89
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:03,760
Yes, I also remember that.

90
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:04,760
Right?

91
00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:05,760
I also remember that.

92
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:10,760
Isn't it here?

93
00:11:10,760 --> 00:11:11,760
Look.

94
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:17,760
I haven't forgiven you for half a day.

95
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:18,760
You are drunk.

96
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:20,760
Let's go.

97
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:22,760
Wait.

98
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:24,760
Wait.

99
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:26,760
Thank you, brother.

100
00:11:28,760 --> 00:11:29,760
Let's go.

101
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:30,760
Slow down.

102
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:42,760
Rui.

103
00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:45,760
Who called me?

104
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:47,760
I'm drunk.

105
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:48,760
Go to sleep.

106
00:11:48,760 --> 00:11:49,760
Go to sleep.

107
00:11:50,760 --> 00:11:51,760
You still have to go to work.

108
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:52,760
Go to sleep.

109
00:11:54,760 --> 00:11:57,760
Why did Rui help me?
