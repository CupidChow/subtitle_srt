00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,680
程健

2
00:00:07,480 --> 00:00:13,480
The Desperate Master

3
00:00:18,140 --> 00:00:20,060
Hello, this is遠出室

4
00:00:20,060 --> 00:00:22,220
The company is going to be closed.

5
00:00:22,220 --> 00:00:23,660
The company is closed.

6
00:00:24,340 --> 00:00:25,940
The company is closed.

7
00:00:28,300 --> 00:00:29,340
Why did Han Chong

8
00:00:29,340 --> 00:00:30,540
keep an eye on Wang Jincheng?

9
00:00:31,340 --> 00:00:32,780
The target is Jinhe.

10
00:00:33,220 --> 00:00:34,700
How big is the trap?

11
00:00:36,340 --> 00:00:36,980
Captain An.

12
00:00:37,300 --> 00:00:38,060
There's still no answer

13
00:00:38,060 --> 00:00:38,980
to Wang Jincheng's phone.

14
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:41,380
He's the general manager.

15
00:00:41,380 --> 00:00:42,380
He has a hundred billion left.

16
00:00:42,380 --> 00:00:43,580
Will he answer the phone?

17
00:00:43,740 --> 00:00:44,420
Captain An, here you go.

18
00:00:44,780 --> 00:00:45,740
I've got the money.

19
00:00:46,740 --> 00:00:48,540
Give the money back to the police.

20
00:00:48,820 --> 00:00:49,460
Tell them

21
00:00:49,460 --> 00:00:50,420
to get more

22
00:00:50,420 --> 00:00:52,180
9999 fraudulent calls like this.

23
00:00:52,180 --> 00:00:53,140
No matter if they're being cheated,

24
00:00:53,140 --> 00:00:54,340
contact us as soon as possible.

25
00:00:54,340 --> 00:00:54,980
Yes.

26
00:01:00,940 --> 00:01:01,740
By the way, Sister.

27
00:01:02,820 --> 00:01:04,380
Someone else should be calling the police.

28
00:01:04,380 --> 00:01:05,900
I don't know how much the fraudulent fund is.

29
00:01:05,900 --> 00:01:07,180
You guys keep an eye on it.

30
00:01:07,180 --> 00:01:08,180
See if anyone else is coming.

31
00:01:08,620 --> 00:01:09,140
Okay.

32
00:01:15,740 --> 00:01:16,500
Captain An.

33
00:01:18,140 --> 00:01:19,540
Well, do you

34
00:01:20,180 --> 00:01:21,260
have enough money?

35
00:01:24,340 --> 00:01:25,540
What can we do

36
00:01:25,860 --> 00:01:26,660
if we meet your Captain Han?

37
00:01:28,140 --> 00:01:28,820
Yang Yang,

38
00:01:29,220 --> 00:01:30,260
go to Wang Jincheng's house with me.

39
00:01:30,260 --> 00:01:30,780
Okay.

40
00:01:34,380 --> 00:01:35,140
Captain An,

41
00:01:35,140 --> 00:01:36,620
we have to hold on to 9999

42
00:01:37,020 --> 00:01:37,980
in case Captain Han

43
00:01:37,980 --> 00:01:38,980
gets more than a million.

44
00:01:39,980 --> 00:01:41,460
I'm not going to let him get away with it.

45
00:01:41,460 --> 00:01:42,460
I'm not going to let him get away with it.

46
00:01:42,460 --> 00:01:43,460
I'm not going to let him get away with it.

47
00:01:43,460 --> 00:01:44,460
I'm not going to let him get away with it.

48
00:01:44,460 --> 00:01:45,460
I'm not going to let him get away with it.

49
00:01:45,860 --> 00:01:47,060
Is there a house in there?

50
00:01:47,660 --> 00:01:49,180
Han Chuan has made such a big effort

51
00:01:49,180 --> 00:01:50,980
to spread the news that he is going to cheat the?

52
00:01:50,980 --> 00:01:51,940
He must have met something

53
00:01:51,940 --> 00:01:53,140
over there.

54
00:01:53,900 --> 00:01:54,740
Let's go.

55
00:01:54,740 --> 00:01:55,340
Okay.

56
00:01:57,140 --> 00:01:58,100
Officer,

57
00:01:58,100 --> 00:01:59,860
it's not that I don't want you to go in.

58
00:01:59,860 --> 00:02:01,220
We have a rule here.

59
00:02:01,220 --> 00:02:02,220
Without the permission of the industry,

60
00:02:02,220 --> 00:02:03,540
I can't let you in.

61
00:02:04,300 --> 00:02:05,020
Look,

62
00:02:05,020 --> 00:02:06,420
we're not in a normal neighborhood.

63
00:02:07,540 --> 00:02:08,260
Besides,

64
00:02:08,260 --> 00:02:09,340
Mr. Wang hasn't come back yet.

65
00:02:09,340 --> 00:02:10,620
When will he come back?

66
00:02:10,620 --> 00:02:11,740
Look at you asking.

67
00:02:11,740 --> 00:02:12,900
How would I know?

68
00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:15,300
That's the car of Mr. Wang.

69
00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:16,620
Don't tell him I told you.

70
00:02:21,940 --> 00:02:22,500
Stop!

71
00:02:22,700 --> 00:02:23,420
Stop!

72
00:02:29,300 --> 00:02:30,300
Where is he going?

73
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:31,500
Wait!

74
00:02:31,940 --> 00:02:32,940
Don't run!

75
00:02:43,540 --> 00:02:44,540
Mr. Wang!

76
00:03:03,620 --> 00:03:04,780
Mr. Wang,

77
00:03:04,780 --> 00:03:05,780
why are you running?

78
00:03:06,380 --> 00:03:07,380
Because...

79
00:03:08,620 --> 00:03:09,620
Because...

80
00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:11,220
I'm not good at drawing.

81
00:03:11,620 --> 00:03:12,820
I'm not good at drawing.

82
00:03:13,220 --> 00:03:14,460
Why are you chasing me?

83
00:03:14,460 --> 00:03:15,540
If you're not good, can you chase me?

84
00:03:15,540 --> 00:03:16,500
If you don't chase me, I can't...

85
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:17,500
Enough, enough.

86
00:03:18,540 --> 00:03:19,540
Mr. Wang,

87
00:03:19,740 --> 00:03:20,380
we're looking for you

88
00:03:20,380 --> 00:03:21,780
because we want you to cooperate with our work.

89
00:03:25,980 --> 00:03:27,220
This Wang Jincheng

90
00:03:27,220 --> 00:03:28,420
is so stubborn.

91
00:03:28,420 --> 00:03:30,100
I can't even speak.

92
00:03:30,460 --> 00:03:32,500
I told him he was pretending to be cheated.

93
00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:33,900
But he didn't cooperate at all.

94
00:03:34,260 --> 00:03:35,780
I have an impression on this person.

95
00:03:35,780 --> 00:03:37,060
I've talked to him before.

96
00:03:37,060 --> 00:03:38,380
He's a real man.

97
00:03:38,380 --> 00:03:39,580
He's not good at drawing.

98
00:03:39,580 --> 00:03:41,100
He likes to take other people's things.

99
00:03:41,140 --> 00:03:41,940
He's so rich.

100
00:03:41,940 --> 00:03:43,140
He even steals other people's things.

101
00:03:43,780 --> 00:03:45,540
There should be some psychological problems.

102
00:03:45,780 --> 00:03:47,060
He's not comfortable

103
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:48,420
if he doesn't take other people's things.

104
00:03:49,260 --> 00:03:51,340
But the things he stole are not expensive.

105
00:03:51,620 --> 00:03:53,340
He's been in our house for several times.

106
00:03:53,540 --> 00:03:54,740
He said he changed it.

107
00:03:55,060 --> 00:03:57,180
No wonder he ran away when he saw us.

108
00:03:58,820 --> 00:04:00,820
But he's not easy to change.

109
00:04:01,460 --> 00:04:02,780
I'll give you an idea.

110
00:04:06,460 --> 00:04:08,980
Okay, okay, baby.

111
00:04:09,940 --> 00:04:10,580
Buy it.

112
00:04:10,900 --> 00:04:12,020
We'll buy it all.

113
00:04:12,420 --> 00:04:14,180
It's just a few hundred thousand yuan.

114
00:04:14,180 --> 00:04:16,500
I'm willing to give it to you.

115
00:04:16,780 --> 00:04:17,740
Don't be angry.

116
00:04:19,140 --> 00:04:21,540
Baby, I'll send a call first.

117
00:04:21,860 --> 00:04:22,540
Buy it.

118
00:04:22,820 --> 00:04:23,620
I'll buy it.

119
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:28,100
Hello.

120
00:04:29,580 --> 00:04:30,300
Buddy.

121
00:04:30,900 --> 00:04:32,420
I recognize your voice.

122
00:04:32,900 --> 00:04:34,940
Don't call me in a panic.

123
00:04:35,540 --> 00:04:36,980
You're just a liar.

124
00:04:37,020 --> 00:04:38,940
You can't fool me.

125
00:04:39,140 --> 00:04:40,980
I'm better than you in every aspect.

126
00:04:41,660 --> 00:04:43,140
I suggest you change your job.

127
00:04:44,020 --> 00:04:45,580
You're not suitable for this job.

128
00:04:46,860 --> 00:04:47,500
You...

129
00:05:07,980 --> 00:05:09,060
You're fired again?

130
00:05:10,700 --> 00:05:13,140
I thought you're more capable than me.

131
00:05:14,220 --> 00:05:15,580
You just want to find a chance

132
00:05:16,100 --> 00:05:17,740
to learn from Xu Xin.

133
00:05:21,180 --> 00:05:22,940
It's almost six hours.

134
00:05:23,860 --> 00:05:24,860
If you go down like this,

135
00:05:25,460 --> 00:05:27,460
you'll have to say goodbye to your uncle.

136
00:05:29,700 --> 00:05:30,540
No, no, no.

137
00:05:37,980 --> 00:05:39,180
You're so angry.

138
00:05:40,620 --> 00:05:41,140
Brother.

139
00:05:41,940 --> 00:05:42,500
Brother.

140
00:05:43,140 --> 00:05:44,380
I heard that my sister had a fever.

141
00:05:44,380 --> 00:05:45,580
But they won't let me eat.

142
00:06:07,900 --> 00:06:08,700
Is it a reasonable amount?

143
00:06:10,300 --> 00:06:10,940
Sir.

144
00:06:11,260 --> 00:06:12,100
I'm sorry.

145
00:06:12,300 --> 00:06:13,700
This is our latest model.

146
00:06:14,060 --> 00:06:14,540
It's not range.

147
00:06:17,140 --> 00:06:18,140
Are you fl largely?

148
00:06:19,660 --> 00:06:20,940
I'm really sorry.

149
00:06:20,940 --> 00:06:21,660
Sir.

150
00:06:22,340 --> 00:06:23,140
I know.

151
00:06:23,900 --> 00:06:24,460
It's this one.

152
00:06:35,300 --> 00:06:36,500
Is it so delicious?

153
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:38,260
Mr. Han, it will be after midnight.

154
00:06:42,620 --> 00:06:42,860
Hey,

155
00:06:43,620 --> 00:06:45,100
why were there only crayfish

156
00:06:45,100 --> 00:06:46,660
which are sold by several billion dollars?

157
00:06:47,100 --> 00:06:47,660
Captain Han,

158
00:06:48,020 --> 00:06:49,300
do we need any吃著的 Flying Fish Condiment?

159
00:06:50,540 --> 00:06:51,260
Just wait.

160
00:07:05,020 --> 00:07:06,140
Sir, it's your bag.

161
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:07,500
Please keep your card.

162
00:07:08,260 --> 00:07:08,860
See you.

163
00:07:09,620 --> 00:07:11,140
Sir, wait a minute.

164
00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:13,580
We just lost a belt.

165
00:07:13,900 --> 00:07:15,980
We may need to check your bag.

166
00:07:17,220 --> 00:07:19,580
You think I stole something from you?

167
00:07:19,860 --> 00:07:21,580
Not only your belt,

168
00:07:21,620 --> 00:07:22,380
but also your business card.

169
00:07:22,380 --> 00:07:23,860
You bought the whole building.

170
00:07:23,900 --> 00:07:25,020
Sir, sir.

171
00:07:25,060 --> 00:07:25,980
Sir, you can't leave.

172
00:07:26,020 --> 00:07:26,860
Let me go.

173
00:07:26,900 --> 00:07:27,540
Hello.

174
00:07:28,420 --> 00:07:29,060
We are police.

175
00:07:29,140 --> 00:07:29,940
Officer An.

176
00:07:30,100 --> 00:07:30,980
You are here.

177
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:33,300
They framed me for stealing his belt.

178
00:07:34,260 --> 00:07:36,740
I stole his belt.

179
00:07:36,780 --> 00:07:37,980
Isn't it ridiculous?

180
00:07:38,060 --> 00:07:39,860
We heard what you said.

181
00:07:40,020 --> 00:07:42,100
He didn't steal the belt.

182
00:07:43,260 --> 00:07:44,100
He did.

183
00:07:47,740 --> 00:07:48,500
See?

184
00:07:48,860 --> 00:07:50,140
He stole it.

185
00:07:56,460 --> 00:07:57,660
If it wasn't an accident,

186
00:07:58,140 --> 00:07:59,220
An Fei should have got the clue

187
00:07:59,260 --> 00:08:00,740
that I sent him back.

188
00:08:01,700 --> 00:08:03,700
Did he find out the truth

189
00:08:04,380 --> 00:08:06,140
or didn't find Wang Jincheng?

190
00:08:07,740 --> 00:08:09,540
How is Xiaoxiao now?

191
00:08:27,260 --> 00:08:28,220
13th Bro.

192
00:08:29,100 --> 00:08:31,340
It's not the time to be idle.

193
00:08:32,820 --> 00:08:35,260
We only have five hours left.

194
00:08:38,060 --> 00:08:39,700
I'm just giving you some information.

195
00:08:39,740 --> 00:08:41,740
Why don't you try it?

196
00:08:42,020 --> 00:08:44,980
You can do it alone.

197
00:08:46,460 --> 00:08:47,060
You...

198
00:08:55,140 --> 00:08:55,780
No.

199
00:08:56,780 --> 00:08:57,740
I'll try again.

200
00:08:59,420 --> 00:09:00,340
Good.

201
00:09:02,140 --> 00:09:02,980
Brother Si Hai.

202
00:09:06,140 --> 00:09:07,660
I'm here to learn

203
00:09:08,180 --> 00:09:10,620
from Brother 13.

204
00:09:11,380 --> 00:09:12,300
Do you mind?

205
00:09:19,180 --> 00:09:20,380
I'm afraid you can't see it

206
00:09:20,540 --> 00:09:21,740
if you don't come.

207
00:09:21,860 --> 00:09:23,260
Why are you so angry?

208
00:09:23,300 --> 00:09:25,020
Can you say something nice?

209
00:09:25,020 --> 00:09:26,060
What's nice?

210
00:09:26,540 --> 00:09:27,460
Learn something.

211
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:29,220
Come on.

212
00:09:29,860 --> 00:09:30,620
Learn.

213
00:09:32,820 --> 00:09:33,620
Mr. Wang.

214
00:09:34,180 --> 00:09:35,420
Let's talk in the video.

215
00:09:35,780 --> 00:09:36,780
You'll know if I'm a liar

216
00:09:36,820 --> 00:09:37,780
when you see me.

217
00:09:47,260 --> 00:09:48,300
It's true.

218
00:09:49,060 --> 00:09:50,740
I'm sorry.

219
00:09:50,860 --> 00:09:52,660
I didn't mean to do it.

220
00:09:52,700 --> 00:09:53,380
Recently,

221
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:54,900
there are too many calls from Zha Ping.

222
00:09:55,060 --> 00:09:56,340
I'm sorry.

223
00:09:58,740 --> 00:10:00,340
Let me confirm again.

224
00:10:01,020 --> 00:10:01,940
Wang Jincheng.

225
00:10:02,700 --> 00:10:04,500
He's the chairman of the new energy company

226
00:10:04,580 --> 00:10:05,860
in Jianghai City, right?

227
00:10:06,180 --> 00:10:06,780
Yes.

228
00:10:07,140 --> 00:10:09,300
According to the backstage of the Golden Shui Four Seasons,

229
00:10:09,420 --> 00:10:10,580
your company is now involved in

230
00:10:10,660 --> 00:10:11,940
tax evasion.

231
00:10:12,100 --> 00:10:14,060
You need to suppress your assets

232
00:10:14,540 --> 00:10:15,540
and let the personnel of the Ministry of Finance

233
00:10:15,580 --> 00:10:16,460
investigate the tax evasion.

234
00:10:17,020 --> 00:10:17,780
Okay.

235
00:10:23,100 --> 00:10:24,340
It seems

236
00:10:26,220 --> 00:10:27,420
it's not that serious.

237
00:10:27,940 --> 00:10:30,180
I'm strictly paying taxes

238
00:10:30,260 --> 00:10:31,340
according to the national rules.

239
00:10:33,020 --> 00:10:33,700
Have you ever

240
00:10:33,780 --> 00:10:34,980
done tax evasion?

241
00:10:35,780 --> 00:10:37,060
Well...

242
00:10:38,100 --> 00:10:39,820
But it's illegal.

243
00:10:39,940 --> 00:10:40,740
It was illegal before,

244
00:10:40,860 --> 00:10:42,260
but it doesn't mean it's legal now.

245
00:10:42,820 --> 00:10:43,780
Wang Jincheng.

246
00:10:45,140 --> 00:10:46,540
You have a sister, right?

247
00:10:47,580 --> 00:10:48,860
Sister?

248
00:10:53,660 --> 00:10:54,620
Sister?

249
00:10:54,740 --> 00:10:55,740
Sister?

250
00:10:58,860 --> 00:11:00,420
Which sister are you talking about?

251
00:11:00,540 --> 00:11:01,780
You know

252
00:11:01,860 --> 00:11:03,220
which sister I'm talking about.

253
00:11:04,220 --> 00:11:06,140
You used her company as a cover

254
00:11:06,260 --> 00:11:07,500
to tax evasion.

255
00:11:07,940 --> 00:11:09,380
Don't think we can't find it out.

256
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:13,260
Comrade.

257
00:11:13,820 --> 00:11:14,900
I was wrong.

258
00:11:15,460 --> 00:11:16,580
I was lucky.

259
00:11:16,700 --> 00:11:17,540
Wang Jincheng.

260
00:11:17,700 --> 00:11:18,780
Listen carefully.

261
00:11:19,660 --> 00:11:21,980
What I'm going to say is very important.

262
00:11:22,900 --> 00:11:25,500
The state is now investigating tax evasion

263
00:11:25,820 --> 00:11:27,740
and punishing it very severely.

264
00:11:28,940 --> 00:11:30,900
Han Chuan is in danger in the park.

265
00:11:31,340 --> 00:11:34,260
You have to pay the tax before six o'clock.

266
00:11:34,740 --> 00:11:35,620
Otherwise,

267
00:11:35,940 --> 00:11:36,860
not only you,

268
00:11:37,140 --> 00:11:39,180
we'll also punish your sister.

269
00:11:39,540 --> 00:11:41,260
She can't get the money before six o'clock.

270
00:11:41,460 --> 00:11:43,420
She and Xiaoxiao are in danger.

271
00:11:44,380 --> 00:11:45,260
But

272
00:11:45,740 --> 00:11:46,980
as long as you make sure

273
00:11:47,060 --> 00:11:48,420
you don't tax evasion again,

274
00:11:48,860 --> 00:11:50,380
the government won't make it difficult for you.

275
00:11:50,620 --> 00:11:51,860
After this,

276
00:11:52,140 --> 00:11:54,500
Han Chuan and Xiaoxiao will be safe for the time being.

277
00:11:55,500 --> 00:11:57,380
Our leader also specially ordered

278
00:11:57,900 --> 00:11:59,460
that as long as the tax is paid,

279
00:11:59,780 --> 00:12:01,620
nothing else will be involved.

280
00:12:02,300 --> 00:12:03,620
We will help you

281
00:12:03,700 --> 00:12:05,340
with the rest of the process.

282
00:12:05,740 --> 00:12:06,900
You'll be safe.

283
00:12:08,620 --> 00:12:10,380
Han Chuan wants the money.

284
00:12:10,580 --> 00:12:13,060
You can pay the tax when the other party pays the money.

285
00:12:13,300 --> 00:12:14,380
Do you understand?

286
00:12:20,420 --> 00:12:21,220
I understand.

287
00:12:21,540 --> 00:12:22,380
I understand.

288
00:12:24,100 --> 00:12:24,900
Sir,

289
00:12:26,180 --> 00:12:28,380
how much tax do I have to pay?

290
00:12:29,340 --> 00:12:30,220
20 million.

291
00:12:35,700 --> 00:12:37,060
20 million?

292
00:12:46,740 --> 00:12:48,020
20 million?

293
00:12:51,860 --> 00:12:53,460
It's한 There's not yet money.

294
00:13:14,100 --> 00:13:14,860
Finish?

295
00:13:15,300 --> 00:13:16,180
미 �, right?

296
00:13:16,180 --> 00:13:17,080
You are welcome

297
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:20,260
Not everyone can travel to the Garden Area

298
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:21,880
You?

299
00:13:22,080 --> 00:13:23,140
You are fool this time

300
00:13:23,140 --> 00:13:24,140
You'll be free

301
00:13:24,300 --> 00:13:25,160
esh

302
00:13:25,660 --> 00:13:26,500
If it's you,

303
00:13:26,780 --> 00:13:27,980
it doesn't mean it's my brother

304
00:13:28,300 --> 00:13:29,300
I can't

305
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:30,440
It doesn't matter

306
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:34,360
Brother 13

307
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:36,920
If you can't make it,

308
00:13:37,640 --> 00:13:38,800
just ask him

309
00:13:39,740 --> 00:13:40,480
Two

310
00:13:43,160 --> 00:13:43,780
Two

311
00:13:46,820 --> 00:13:47,460
Let's go.

312
00:13:48,420 --> 00:13:49,860
You guys...

313
00:13:53,020 --> 00:13:54,700
You're so stubborn.

314
00:13:56,980 --> 00:13:57,660
13th.

315
00:13:58,660 --> 00:13:59,700
Don't let Wei Wei down.

316
00:14:01,820 --> 00:14:02,580
She's got time.

317
00:14:03,860 --> 00:14:04,540
Wait for her.

318
00:14:16,180 --> 00:14:16,940
Let's go.

319
00:14:19,460 --> 00:14:20,260
Mr. Wang, listen to me.

320
00:14:20,260 --> 00:14:21,180
I really can't cooperate.

321
00:14:21,540 --> 00:14:22,980
Pack up and leave.

322
00:14:23,740 --> 00:14:24,340
Listen.

323
00:14:24,900 --> 00:14:25,700
Officer.

324
00:14:25,900 --> 00:14:27,340
I'm sorry.

325
00:14:27,340 --> 00:14:28,580
Please understand.

326
00:14:28,580 --> 00:14:29,820
Mr. Wang, listen to me.

327
00:14:29,820 --> 00:14:30,740
We'll do our best

328
00:14:30,740 --> 00:14:31,820
to ensure your safety.

329
00:14:31,820 --> 00:14:33,180
It's my colleague's business.

330
00:14:33,180 --> 00:14:35,420
But you didn't say it's 20 million.

331
00:14:35,980 --> 00:14:36,820
Officer An.

332
00:14:37,220 --> 00:14:38,420
I'm not not helping you.

333
00:14:38,620 --> 00:14:40,700
If Officer Han says it's 200,000,

334
00:14:40,940 --> 00:14:41,700
300,000,

335
00:14:41,780 --> 00:14:43,100
even if it's 2 million,

336
00:14:43,420 --> 00:14:45,220
I'll agree to it.

337
00:14:45,260 --> 00:14:46,420
It's saving people, right?

338
00:14:46,700 --> 00:14:49,100
But it's 20 million.

339
00:14:49,300 --> 00:14:50,100
It's rich.

340
00:14:50,500 --> 00:14:52,020
But it's not a big deal.

341
00:14:52,220 --> 00:14:53,700
I can't make much money.

342
00:14:53,940 --> 00:14:54,700
Mr. Wang.

343
00:14:54,900 --> 00:14:55,500
Officer An.

344
00:14:55,700 --> 00:14:57,460
You don't like to hear it.

345
00:14:57,660 --> 00:14:59,220
Officer Han is your brother.

346
00:14:59,340 --> 00:14:59,820
But...

347
00:15:01,300 --> 00:15:02,900
It has nothing to do with me.

348
00:15:02,900 --> 00:15:04,260
It's not related to me.

349
00:15:04,380 --> 00:15:05,220
I can't do it.

350
00:15:05,300 --> 00:15:06,420
I really can't.

351
00:15:06,420 --> 00:15:07,100
You guys...

352
00:15:07,940 --> 00:15:08,940
are so smart.

353
00:15:09,460 --> 00:15:10,340
Let's go, everyone.

354
00:15:10,340 --> 00:15:10,940
I'm sorry.

355
00:15:10,940 --> 00:15:11,460
Mr. Qin.

356
00:15:11,460 --> 00:15:12,180
Pack up.

357
00:15:12,180 --> 00:15:13,500
Let's go.

358
00:15:13,820 --> 00:15:14,420
Mr. Luo.

359
00:15:14,420 --> 00:15:15,180
It's okay.

360
00:15:15,180 --> 00:15:16,140
Let's go.
