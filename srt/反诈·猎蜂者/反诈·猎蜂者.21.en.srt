00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Episode 16

3
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Search!

4
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:26,000
Search every room!

5
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Search every room!

6
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,000
You scared me!

7
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Search every room!

8
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Brother, come here!

9
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
Search every room!

10
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Search every room!

11
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Search every table and every cabinet!

12
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Hurry up!

13
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Don't be slow!

14
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Brother!

15
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Let Li find the mountain!

16
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Li find the garbage!

17
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,000
The garbage is full!

18
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
I'll go, don't bother me!

19
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Don't move!

20
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,000
I'll go to the school!

21
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Your phone is big!

22
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Brother Yang, I'm sorry.

23
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,000
I thought it was our black police.

24
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,000
It's okay.

25
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
My classmate Li Bailing is still in the police station.

26
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,000
You go and save him!

27
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Your classmate?

28
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Yes.

29
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:05,000
The Taoism Grandmaster

30
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Xiao Xiao!

31
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,000
They are here to detain me!

32
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
He died to save me.

33
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
He died to save me!

34
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,000
He died to save me!

35
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Xiao Xiao, don't move!

36
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Xiao Xiao, listen to me!

37
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Listen to me!

38
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
He died to save me!

39
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Listen to me, Xiao Xiao!

40
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Don't worry.

41
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:34,000
We will detain these criminals.

42
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
But now,

43
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
I need you to tell me everything

44
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,000
that happened in the east.

45
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Brother,

46
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
I said I had to go to the garbage.

47
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
I've been searching for a month.

48
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Please give me a break.

49
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Brother Siyao, we've searched everywhere.

50
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
No one is here.

51
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Let's go.

52
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Hurry up and take this thing away.

53
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Okay.

54
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Take care.

55
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Brother.

56
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Brother.

57
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,000
It's safe now.

58
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Brother, are you okay?

59
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Sang Tuo locked you in the gold house.

60
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Did he take you to the police?

61
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
No.

62
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:48,000
I need you to help me get back to work.

63
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Don't worry, brother.

64
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
You've been hiding here for the past few days.

65
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
I've been asking about your news.

66
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
After the storm,

67
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
I secretly brought you to the dock.

68
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Since Sang Tuo

69
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
took the power of the Iron Buddha,

70
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
half of the people in the area

71
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:04,000
use the boat to send in new pigs

72
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
to replenish their blood.

73
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
As long as their boat doesn't stop,

74
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000
you'll have a chance to leave.

75
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
You should be able to

76
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
enter Sang Tuo's office now.

77
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
I need you to help me.

78
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
I'm responsible for sending them food.

79
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
I can take this opportunity to get back to work.

80
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:20,000
But brother, you're a police officer.

81
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
You finally got out.

82
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Hurry up and leave.

83
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
If they catch you again,

84
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,000
they'll kill you.

85
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Sang Tuo won't be patient with you.

86
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
I have to go up there

87
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
and get the evidence.

88
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
My colleagues have arrived at the dock.

89
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
I'll be back in a few days.

90
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
As long as I get the evidence,

91
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Sang Tuo and the others can't escape.

92
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Really?

93
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
The Chinese police are really coming?

94
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Did you see it?

95
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
From the criminal's office to Lin's office,

96
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
all the floors have been turned upside down.

97
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
I still haven't seen the dock.

98
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
I told you to help the security guard in the security office.

99
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
You told me that you had made the dock

100
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
into a place where even flies can't get in.

101
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
It's been so long now.

102
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Can't you find anyone?

103
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Brother, I've planted

104
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
more than 200 cameras in the entire building.

105
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Even if Lin's office is not equipped,

106
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
all the cameras are still in place.

107
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
I'm going to find the camera.

108
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
I'll go and find it.

109
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
I'll go and find it.

110
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
I'll go and find it.

111
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
I'll go and find it.

112
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
I can't find it.

113
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
It's definitely not in the building.

114
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Just keep looking for it.

115
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
If you can't find it by noon tomorrow,

116
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
you'll go to Lin's office.

117
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Okay.

118
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Sang,

119
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
have some more later.

120
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Brother,

121
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
you're so close to Brother 13.

122
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
You must know where he is, right?

123
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Right?

124
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
I don't know.

125
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
I've never seen him.

126
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Be good.

127
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
You tell me.

128
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
I'm so good to him.

129
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
He said he didn't want to do fraud.

130
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
I helped him.

131
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
I let him be a police officer in the East.

132
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Why is he still not good?

133
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
He's a Chinese police officer.

134
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
He has his own country.

135
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Right.

136
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
He's a Chinese police officer.

137
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
Right.

138
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
You're right.

139
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
He's a police officer.

140
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
We're not on the same side.

141
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
I treat him as a brother.

142
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
But he only wants to catch me.

143
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
He's just a rock.

144
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
I shouldn't be so kind to him.

145
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
Right?

146
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
He and we can never be on the same side.

147
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
We just need to use him.

148
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
Right.

149
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
You're right.

150
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
I just need to use him.

151
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
I shouldn't have so many feelings for him.

152
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
He's just a tool.

153
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
I used him to use his anti-cops identity

154
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
to open the Chinese market.

155
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Right?

156
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
That's right.

157
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
Right.

158
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
If he's not obedient,

159
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
I'll torture him.

160
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Since he's not soft,

161
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
I'll take him down.

162
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
Give me a few more steps.

163
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:00,000
Knock every stone on the ground.

164
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
Here.

165
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
Where?

166
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
Give me a few more steps.

167
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
Sister, it's time.

168
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
Don't be idle.

169
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
Help Xi Yan find her.

170
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Sister,

171
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
you still want to protect Xi Shan?

172
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
Protect him?

173
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
I just want to sleep with him.

174
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
He wants to kill me.

175
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Then you're here...

176
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
There's a footprint on the wall.

177
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
He's probably going to the canteen.

178
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:52,000
Where can I run if I take him down?

179
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:09,000
Brother, you're running away like this?

180
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
Where's my sister?

181
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
Han Xiaoxiao.

182
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
She's at the police station.

183
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000
I want to see her.

184
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
If you don't let me see her,

185
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
I'll find a way to escape.

186
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
Brother,

187
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
I gave you a chance

188
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
to see your sister.

189
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
But you didn't cherish it.

190
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
Now you don't have the right

191
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
to see anyone.

192
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
Sang Duo,

193
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
I came to Dongbang to find her.

194
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
I know she's in your hands now.

195
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
If you let her go,

196
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
I can listen to you.

197
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
Really?

198
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
But, brother,

199
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
after what happened today,

200
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:53,000
how can I trust you?

201
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
What do you want?

202
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
What do I want?

203
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
I heard you have a colleague coming tomorrow.

204
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:05,000
You should go see her with me.

205
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
What are you doing?

206
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
Yaoqi,

207
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
give her the medicine after an hour.

208
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
Xiaoxiao.

209
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
Xiaoxiao.

210
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
Xiaoxiao.

211
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
You're safe now.

212
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
Just rest here.

213
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
Don't be afraid.

214
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
I'm fine.

215
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
I'm fine.

216
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
I'm fine.

217
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
I'll go.

218
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
I'll go.

219
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
Hello?

220
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
It's me.

221
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,000
Don't worry.

222
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
We'll be there on time tomorrow.

223
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
Okay.

224
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
Who is it, Captain An?

225
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,000
The chief of Dongbang Police

226
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
will see us tomorrow.

227
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
He called us so late.

228
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
Well,

229
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
Yaoqi, you'll go with me tomorrow.

230
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
Yaoqi, you stay here with Xiaoxiao.

231
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
No need.

232
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
I'm not afraid.

233
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
Someone must accompany you

234
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
to ensure your safety.

235
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
Your brother finally saved you.

236
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
If anything happens to you,

237
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
how can I explain it to him?

238
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
Be good.

239
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,000
I don't know

240
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
how my brother is doing.

241
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
Don't worry.

242
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,000
I'll bring you and your brother

243
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,000
back safely.

244
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,000
Have a rest.

245
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,000
An Fei,

246
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,000
you're An Fei, right?

247
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,000
Yes.

248
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,000
Hello.

249
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,000
An.

250
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,000
Yes.

251
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,000
Hello.

252
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
Come in, please.

253
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,000
An Fei,

254
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,000
you're An Fei, right?

255
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,000
Yes.

256
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
Come in.

257
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
Officer An, please.

258
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
Let me introduce.

259
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
This is our new chief of staff.

260
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
This is Officer An Fei.

261
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,000
He's the representative of

262
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,000
the Chinese side of the joint criminal law.

263
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,000
Hello, chief.

264
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,000
I'm the representative of the Chinese side

265
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
of this operation, An Fei.

266
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
This is my colleague, Yang Yang.

267
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,000
It's been a long time, Officer An.

268
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,000
You finally meet me.

269
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:15,000
Have you heard of me?

270
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,000
We know each other.

271
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,000
I always know

272
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
my colleagues and enemies

273
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
the same way.

274
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,000
Let me introduce myself.

275
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000
I'm the chief of staff of this police station.

276
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,000
My name is Sang Tuo.

277
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
Where's the chief of staff

278
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
who worked with us before?

279
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,000
It's a shame to say this.

280
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,000
The evil forces of the East Gang

281
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,000
are much stronger than you think.

282
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,000
The former chief of staff

283
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
was fired because of corruption.

284
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,000
So I'm in charge of

285
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,000
the chief's position.

286
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:47,000
We'll communicate later.

287
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,000
Okay.

288
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,000
By the way, where's Officer Han?

289
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,000
He's outside.

290
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,000
I'll go and get him.

291
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,000
Please.

292
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
Officer Han, please.

293
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,000
Han Chuan.

294
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,000
An Fei.

295
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,000
Yang Yang.

296
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,000
Officer An.

297
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,000
Why are you here so late?

298
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,000
You're still so strong.

299
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,000
You've lost a lot of weight.

300
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
You're still so white.

301
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
Okay, stop sighing.

302
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,000
It's time to talk about business.

303
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,000
Please have a seat.

304
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,000
Sit.

305
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,000
Officer An.

306
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,000
Congratulations, Officer Han.

307
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,000
You've met your comrades.

308
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
You're going to return to the team soon.

309
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,000
Not yet.

310
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,000
I still have a lot of

311
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,000
tasks to complete

312
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,000
at the Eastern Gang Police Station.

313
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,000
I still have to stay

314
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,000
and help Chief Sang.

315
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,000
Right.

316
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,000
So in order to help Officer Han

317
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,000
return to the team as soon as possible,

318
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,000
we have to get rid of

319
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,000
this scourge area as soon as possible.

320
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,000
What's Officer An's plan

321
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,000
for this?

322
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,000
Our plan is to

323
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,000
make justice in advance

324
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,000
and start tomorrow.

325
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,000
Tomorrow?

326
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,000
Based on our experience,

327
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,000
the most important thing

328
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,000
about the operation

329
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,000
of the scourge area

330
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,000
is the suddenness.

331
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,000
As long as we can

332
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:50,360
strike them with a

333
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,000
good plan,

334
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,000
we'll be able to

335
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,000
get rid of them.

336
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,000
But, Officer An,

337
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,000
after you arrive at the island,

338
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,000
do you have any plans?

339
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,000
Based on the information

340
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,000
Han Chuan gave us,

341
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,000
the Red Medicine Stone Island

342
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,000
is surrounded by mountains.

343
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,000
The South East River is the dock.

344
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,000
The main road

345
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,000
is directly connected to the main building.

346
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,000
Don't forget that

347
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,000
the armed forces of the criminals

348
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,000
are concentrated on the main road.

349
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,000
Of course we won't go to the main road.

350
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,000
But on the left side of the main road

351
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,000
is a forest.

352
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,000
We can send a team

353
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,000
of people to the Yanggong.

354
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,000
Then, on the right side...

355
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,000
is the Song Si.

356
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,000
There are several small roads

357
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,000
on the southeast side of the island.

358
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,000
We can also go to the main road.

359
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,000
The small road on the south side

360
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,000
is complicated.

361
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,000
The narrow road is dense.

362
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,000
We can only go to the death.

363
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,000
And it's very easy

364
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,000
to be surrounded by enemies.

365
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,000
Your plan is not working.

366
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,000
It seems that Chief Sang

367
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,000
knows more about

368
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,000
the Red Medicine Stone Island than we do.

369
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,000
It's raining heavily.

370
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,000
Officer Yang, have some sleep.

371
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,000
Officer Han.

372
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,000
Thank you.

373
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,000
Officer Han.

374
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,000
Thank you.

375
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,000
Chief.

376
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,000
I don't need it.

377
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,000
Where is the medicine?

378
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,000
Please come with me.

379
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,000
Okay.

380
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,000
I'm from the East.

381
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,000
It's more convenient

382
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,000
to know more about this information.

383
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,000
Officer An.

384
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,000
Don't underestimate

385
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,000
this area.

386
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,000
The criminals here

387
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:34,000
are all dead.

388
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,000
The guns used by the police

389
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,000
are much better

390
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,000
than the guns

391
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,000
used by my agent.

392
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,000
I didn't expect that

393
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,000
a small area

394
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,000
could have more than

395
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,000
the police's armed forces.

396
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,000
Of course.

397
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,000
Here,

398
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,000
money can make people

399
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:48,000
buy the medicine

400
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,000
and the disease

401
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,000
can make people sell the disease.

402
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,000
The silver starry sky

403
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,000
is like a dream

404
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,000
It's like a dream

405
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,000
The dark clouds

406
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,000
are like a dream

407
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,000
The light in my fingertips

408
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,000
is like a winter

409
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,000
The light in my fingertips

410
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,000
is like a winter

411
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,000
The light in my fingertips

412
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:52,000
is while holding on to the fire

413
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,000
The unnamed easing

414
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:04,000
약간 böyle

415
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:09,000
Ignites in theouve

416
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,000
Fist drawn to the fire

417
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,000
Shimmer

418
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,000
To light the way

419
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,000
The wind blows the wind

420
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,000
