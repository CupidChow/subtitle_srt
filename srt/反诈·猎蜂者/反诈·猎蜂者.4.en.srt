1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,620
Going Back to the

2
00:00:03,640 --> 00:00:06,580
Previous Episode

3
00:00:23,860 --> 00:00:26,440
People

4
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,520
I've been waiting for you all day.

5
00:00:31,520 --> 00:00:32,760
You...

6
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:34,880
I know what you want to say.

7
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:36,320
I only have one word.

8
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:39,000
You have to be careful here.

9
00:00:39,560 --> 00:00:40,720
I drank too much last night.

10
00:00:40,720 --> 00:00:41,920
I heard nothing.

11
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:42,880
I didn't see anything either.

12
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:47,960
How about this, Brother?

13
00:00:48,720 --> 00:00:49,880
Go with me to serve the dishes.

14
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:52,480
I'll show you around the park.

15
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:54,040
Don't make trouble in the future.

16
00:00:54,040 --> 00:00:54,800
I won't.

17
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:55,800
I'll go with you.

18
00:00:55,800 --> 00:00:57,360
I'll go with you.

19
00:00:57,360 --> 00:00:58,360
I'll go with you.

20
00:00:58,360 --> 00:00:59,320
I'll go with you.

21
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,000
I'll go with you.

22
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:14,640
Why is he here?

23
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:16,840
Brother, look at him.

24
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:18,480
He's the eldest son of the sister.

25
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:19,480
He's a big guy.

26
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:21,560
He's like a grandson to her.

27
00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:22,840
He's so careless.

28
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:24,520
But he's not close to them.

29
00:01:24,520 --> 00:01:25,520
He's far away.

30
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:27,320
Brother, you just got out of the pot.

31
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:28,320
What?

32
00:01:29,240 --> 00:01:30,240
Enjoy your meal.

33
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:36,800
Brother, look at that guy with a beard.

34
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:39,200
He's the leader of the Black Ghost East Luo Liao Clan.

35
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:40,480
He's so far away.

36
00:01:40,480 --> 00:01:42,080
He's not close to them.

37
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:44,480
They're at the bottom of their performance this month.

38
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:46,960
He and Ba Si Hai fight every day.

39
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:48,160
They're very angry.

40
00:01:48,160 --> 00:01:49,480
We're far away from them.

41
00:01:52,160 --> 00:01:53,160
Brother Dong.

42
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:54,160
I'm here to see you.

43
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:56,120
Brother Dong.

44
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,400
Your favorite, the horse blood bun.

45
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:03,560
Put it here.

46
00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:07,440
Who is he?

47
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:09,440
He just came to see me.

48
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,000
The second eldest son.

49
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Hello.

50
00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:17,760
Enjoy your meal.

51
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:19,560
Ba Si Hai.

52
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:20,920
He's fine.

53
00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:22,480
He's a cruel man.

54
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:23,800
But he's not smart.

55
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:25,440
I'm not saying that.

56
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:27,080
Our restaurant is good.

57
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:29,520
But we only have more goods and less money.

58
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:31,560
Once we go upstairs and do the check-in,

59
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:32,560
we'll be done.

60
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:34,680
If we can't do business, we'll be sold.

61
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:35,680
Or we'll be sold out.

62
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:38,400
Sold out?

63
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:40,920
Isn't that the case?

64
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:42,320
Those who are covered by the eye mask,

65
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:44,080
those who are removed from the kidney,

66
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:45,560
and those who have no arms or legs.

67
00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:47,760
Poor them.

68
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:51,080
Here you are.

69
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:55,800
Here.

70
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:00,120
Here.

71
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:01,120
Here.

72
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:13,320
Hai.

73
00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:14,040
Have you eaten?

74
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:14,640
Are you busy today?

75
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:16,080
I'll cook for you.

76
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:17,080
Pork.

77
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:20,080
Hai.

78
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:21,280
You're here for dinner?

79
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:22,640
Let's go and cook for Mr. Hai.

80
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:23,320
No need.

81
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:24,360
What are you doing?

82
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:25,360
Get lost!

83
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:26,360
None of your business.

84
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:28,640
Hai.

85
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:30,240
Hai.

86
00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:32,840
He's the police I mentioned.

87
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:37,760
Is there some misunderstanding?

88
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:40,320
You heard me on the phone.

89
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:41,320
I'm a security guard.

90
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:43,400
How can I be a police?

91
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Misunderstanding?

92
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:47,880
You think I'm a thief?

93
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:50,160
Didn't you say you were a police?

94
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:52,320
Hai, I think...

95
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:53,320
Bring Uncle Fu.

96
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:55,720
Who dares to touch him?

97
00:03:55,720 --> 00:03:57,160
Hai!

98
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:00,040
I was a security guard.

99
00:04:00,920 --> 00:04:01,920
But we're colleagues.

100
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:13,360
Colleagues?

101
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:15,240
Tell me.

102
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:16,240
What's going on with the Han River?

103
00:04:16,840 --> 00:04:18,440
Since it's like this, I'll be honest.

104
00:04:19,080 --> 00:04:20,640
I followed Ying Ge's

105
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:21,920
No. 13.

106
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:24,560
I'm sorry to let you see me like this.

107
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:25,960
My name is 13.

108
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:28,160
Ying Ge.

109
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:29,760
My real name is Xie Yingwang.

110
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:31,360
My nickname is Ying.

111
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:33,920
Ten years ago,

112
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:35,360
I was in the bank with someone.

113
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:39,400
Tell me.

114
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:40,600
What did you do?

115
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:44,520
In 2017,

116
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:46,400
I was cheated 40 million

117
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:47,720
from the boss of Caivang Group.

118
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:49,480
In 2020,

119
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:51,640
the board was scammed with 100 million drugs.

120
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:53,040
In 2022,

121
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:55,040
the star couple was cheated 7 million.

122
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:56,040
You've heard of this, right?

123
00:04:56,680 --> 00:04:57,680
I did all of this.

124
00:04:57,960 --> 00:04:59,760
It's probably a case of your learning.

125
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:02,760
Hai.

126
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:04,400
It seems like he's telling the truth.

127
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:06,240
Turn around.

128
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:07,680
You're mixed with Ying, right?

129
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:09,720
You must know him.

130
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:12,720
Who is he?

131
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:14,640
We all call him Second Brother.

132
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:16,560
He's the one who invests in stocks.

133
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:19,280
I'm the one who pretends to be a young man.

134
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:22,600
Little girl.

135
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:24,080
I'm sorry.

136
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:25,080
I'm sorry.

137
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:26,080
I'm sorry.

138
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:27,080
I'm sorry.

139
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:28,080
I'm sorry.

140
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:29,080
I'm sorry.

141
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:30,080
I'm sorry.

142
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:31,080
I'm sorry.

143
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:32,080
I'm sorry.

144
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:33,080
I'm sorry.

145
00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:34,080
I'm sorry.

146
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:35,080
I'm sorry.

147
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:36,080
I'm sorry.

148
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:39,080
Did I pretend to be a cop and cheat you?

149
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:40,920
You misunderstood me.

150
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:42,240
I...

151
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:43,960
Hai.

152
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:46,960
No.

153
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:49,040
What about the security?

154
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:51,040
Hai.

155
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:53,440
You're hiding from the police.

156
00:05:54,840 --> 00:05:55,840
In April last year,

157
00:05:56,760 --> 00:05:57,760
Ying went to Fujian

158
00:05:57,760 --> 00:05:59,760
to talk about the business of the water king with Ren Qing Hua.

159
00:06:00,280 --> 00:06:02,560
But he was already under the police's watch.

160
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:04,080
I was in a hurry

161
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:05,800
and ran away as a fake.

162
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:08,320
I wanted to hide in the east.

163
00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:09,920
But you got me here.

164
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:17,600
Hai.

165
00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:19,400
People and stones are alike.

166
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:21,520
Ying is a fierce man.

167
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:23,560
If he's really Shi Shan,

168
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:24,800
why didn't he...

169
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:37,080
Shi Shan, right?

170
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:39,240
I heard it on the street.

171
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:43,200
But I haven't seen him for a long time.

172
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:45,200
You're smart.

173
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:47,880
You're using this kind of person as an identity.

174
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:50,280
Indeed, I haven't seen him.

175
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:52,400
But what I said is true.

176
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:53,880
You can verify it.

177
00:06:55,080 --> 00:06:56,080
Hai.

178
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:57,560
I heard that

179
00:06:57,800 --> 00:06:59,600
when the show was in China,

180
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:01,400
you followed Ying and Shi Shan.

181
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:04,400
I didn't know that.

182
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:05,800
Oh?

183
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:07,520
Call Santa.

184
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:09,240
Let him recognize you.

185
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:11,240
Yes.

186
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:17,920
Messi.

187
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:20,520
You have to ask me to come down.

188
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:22,520
Hurry up.

189
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:24,720
I'm busy.

190
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:26,960
What's wrong, Santa?

191
00:07:27,640 --> 00:07:29,320
I'm already mixed with you.

192
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:31,040
I can't call you anymore, right?

193
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:34,200
Wu Xie Na, Yi Xi, Hai.

194
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:35,840
I'm just afraid that

195
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:36,960
if you're caught by Sister Sha,

196
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:38,560
it won't be easy to explain.

197
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:39,560
Don't talk nonsense.

198
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:41,440
Let me ask you.

199
00:07:42,280 --> 00:07:45,040
Did you fight with Ying in China?

200
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:47,400
Of course.

201
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:50,400
He Xin, Gu Gan, Zhong Liu, and Di Zhu.

202
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:51,560
If not for Sister Sha,

203
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:54,560
you wouldn't have come here.

204
00:07:55,320 --> 00:07:56,640
That is to say,

205
00:07:57,600 --> 00:07:58,600
Ying,

206
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:00,560
Sui Jian,

207
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:01,680
and Shi Shan,

208
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:03,120
you've seen them all, right?

209
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:06,360
We're all friends.

210
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:09,480
We often drink together.

211
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:10,800
Let me show you.

212
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:13,360
This one.

213
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:15,120
Do you know him?

214
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:17,640
He asked me about Ying's show

215
00:08:17,640 --> 00:08:19,360
and asked me to recognize him.

216
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:22,360
I heard that Ying and Sui Jian have been in.

217
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:24,360
This person's show is...

218
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:28,160
C3 Gou.

219
00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:30,040
C3 Gou?

220
00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:34,640
Long time no see, C3 Gou!

221
00:08:36,040 --> 00:08:37,440
In Shi Shan's testimony,

222
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:39,440
he didn't mention this Sui Jian.

223
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:41,440
But after he saw me,

224
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:46,440
he got excited and recognized me as Shi Shan.

225
00:08:47,640 --> 00:08:50,040
It seems that this guy was bragging.

226
00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:52,040
He definitely doesn't know Shi Shan.

227
00:08:52,760 --> 00:08:53,760
Who are you?

228
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:56,640
C3 Gou is me.

229
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:57,640
Si Yan Zai?

230
00:08:58,240 --> 00:08:59,640
My boss plays Fat Cat.

231
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:01,640
Cat follows Gou.

232
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:03,240
Do you know Gou?

233
00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:05,640
Gou has been following me.

234
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:09,240
He has a man called Fat Cat.

235
00:09:09,640 --> 00:09:11,640
I don't know the person below him.

236
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:13,640
Gou?

237
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:15,640
I don't know the person below him.

238
00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:16,640
Sorry.

239
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:19,040
It's okay, C3 Gou.

240
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:21,040
You finally meet me today.

241
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:23,040
You're here to see me?

242
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:24,320
I'm new here.

243
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:25,320
I'm not allowed to be here.

244
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:26,320
You can't.

245
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:29,320
Just tell me if you need any help.

246
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:32,320
You're not loyal.

247
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:33,320
You're not loyal.

248
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:34,320
You're not loyal.

249
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:36,320
You've seen me before.

250
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:37,320
You don't know me.

251
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:38,320
He doesn't know you.

252
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:40,320
I'm with Cat.

253
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:42,320
Of course I need help.

254
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:44,320
Besides,

255
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:46,320
C3 Gou is a big character.

256
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:47,320
I know him.

257
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:48,320
He doesn't know me.

258
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:50,320
Isn't this a normal show?

259
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:51,600
And

260
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:53,600
Cat always mentions C3 Gou.

261
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:56,600
He'll be familiar with me.

262
00:09:58,600 --> 00:09:59,600
Aiguo.

263
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:02,600
Please.

264
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:04,600
Don't let Sister Zha know.

265
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:06,600
It's okay.

266
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:07,600
I'll talk to him.

267
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:09,600
C3 Gou, I'm going up first.

268
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:12,600
Just tell me if you need any help.

269
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:14,600
Aiguo.

270
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:17,600
Help me take good care of C3 Gou.

271
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:19,600
Let's go.

272
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:21,600
Let's go.

273
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:24,600
Brother Hai.

274
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:26,600
I've seen him in a police uniform.

275
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:27,600
Enough!

276
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:35,600
13.

277
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:41,600
I'm going to talk to my 13th brother alone.

278
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:51,600
I'm sorry.

279
00:10:58,600 --> 00:11:00,600
Brother Hai, please take me out.

280
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:01,600
Is there any way?

281
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:02,600
Please.

282
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:04,600
I can't take it anymore.

283
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:05,600
I really can't.

284
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:08,600
According to my observation,

285
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:10,600
the fastest way to get out of here

286
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:14,600
is to use the ship of Ba Sihai's business.

287
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:18,600
But I need you to help me find Xiaoxiao.

288
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:19,600
Is that okay?

289
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:21,600
Okay.

290
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:22,600
No problem.

291
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:24,600
Do you have a plan?

292
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:26,600
I want to meet the team of Ba Sihai

293
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:28,600
and get his trust.

294
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:30,600
Only then can I take you away.

295
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:32,600
Then who are you on your left?

296
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:34,600
The two of us in the canteen.

297
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:36,600
The two of us?

298
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:38,600
You...

299
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:39,600
You're in the canteen.

300
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:42,600
Is it so hard to be the second son of the canteen?

301
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:44,600
That's why I need your protection.

302
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:47,600
How can I protect you?

303
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:49,600
Calm down.

304
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:51,600
Calm down.

305
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:57,600
Tell Ba Sihai that I'm a police officer.

306
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:03,600
Shi San.

307
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:08,600
When I first met you,

308
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:10,600
I thought you were different from Ben.

309
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:23,600
You're so bold, bro.

310
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:24,600
Not bad.

311
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:26,600
No.

312
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:28,600
Let me tell you.

313
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:30,600
This is the first time I've heard

314
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:32,600
someone say that they're police officers.

315
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:36,600
Shi San,

316
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:38,600
with your boldness

317
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:40,600
and your past skills,

318
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:42,600
you've been in the kitchen

319
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:44,600
and been in the kitchen.

320
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:46,600
You've been in the kitchen

321
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:47,600
and been in the kitchen.

322
00:12:47,880 --> 00:12:48,880
You're so miserable.

323
00:12:49,880 --> 00:12:50,880
Bro,

324
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:52,880
I'm good in the kitchen.

325
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:54,880
I can cook every day.

326
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:55,880
It's comfortable.

327
00:12:55,880 --> 00:12:56,880
I don't have to work all night.

328
00:12:58,880 --> 00:12:59,880
You can't make money.

329
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:01,880
I don't care about money.

330
00:13:01,880 --> 00:13:02,880
As long as I can hide from the police,

331
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:03,880
I'll be the same wherever I go.

332
00:13:05,880 --> 00:13:07,880
Since you said you're the same wherever you go,

333
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:09,880
come to my place.

334
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:13,880
I'll give you 30% of the commission

335
00:13:13,880 --> 00:13:15,880
for your performance.

336
00:13:15,880 --> 00:13:16,880
How's that?

337
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:18,880
Thank you, bro.

338
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:19,880
You're so kind.

339
00:13:29,880 --> 00:13:30,880
Bro Shi San,

340
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:34,880
I believe you can go back to the past.

341
00:13:35,880 --> 00:13:36,880
You're here

342
00:13:37,880 --> 00:13:38,880
to serve others.

343
00:13:41,880 --> 00:13:43,880
You don't want to move forward?

344
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:46,160
You don't want to move forward?

345
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:53,160
Meat.

346
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:55,160
I've put it in your mouth.

347
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:57,160
If you don't eat it,

348
00:13:58,160 --> 00:13:59,160
you can think about it.

349
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:02,160
There's one more thing I want to warn you.

350
00:14:03,160 --> 00:14:04,160
The one standing next to me

351
00:14:05,160 --> 00:14:06,160
is my friend.

352
00:14:07,160 --> 00:14:08,160
The others

353
00:14:09,160 --> 00:14:10,160
are all opponents.

354
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:11,440
I'm the most determined one.

355
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:17,440
I have a request.

356
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:22,440
Say it.

357
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:26,440
I want to go to the sixth floor.

358
00:14:32,440 --> 00:14:33,440
You're all men.

359
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:36,440
You can understand that

360
00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:37,440
if you like women,

361
00:14:38,440 --> 00:14:39,440
you can be a man.

362
00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:41,440
Right?

363
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:42,440
But when you want to enjoy it,

364
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:44,440
you have to make a profit.

365
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:47,440
This is the company's rule.

366
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:50,440
Tomorrow, go to the second floor

367
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:52,440
and report to me.

368
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:12,420
Why is everyone so taking it seriously?

369
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:14,720
Just

370
00:15:15,820 --> 00:15:16,720
put on this makeup 좋아요

371
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:18,560
then you will feel stuck.

372
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:22,360
Are you okay by yourself today?

373
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:32,560
Are you satisfied now?

374
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:36,320
I think you did a good job today.

375
00:15:37,840 --> 00:15:39,480
I think like the correct way.

376
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:41,160
I'm sorry.

377
00:15:41,160 --> 00:15:42,160
I'm sorry.

378
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:43,160
I'm sorry.

379
00:15:43,160 --> 00:15:44,160
I'm sorry.

380
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:45,160
