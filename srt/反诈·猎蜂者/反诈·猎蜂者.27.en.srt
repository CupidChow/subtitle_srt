The Long Ballad

00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Episode 2

3
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Come out, Zhang Hanyun!

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Give me back my drink!

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Give me back my drink!

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Give me back my drink!

7
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Give me back my drink!

8
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Calm down!

9
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Calm down! Listen to me!

10
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Listen to me!

11
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Listen to me!

12
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Calm down, okay?

13
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Listen to me!

14
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Calm down first!

15
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
You're not Han Chuan!

16
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,000
You're a liar!

17
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,000
You're using a fake trick to fool us!

18
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,000
I told you that I'm a police officer!

19
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000
How can we be so convenient to see a fake?

20
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:38,000
I don't care!

21
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
We just recognize Han Chuan's face!

22
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,000
He lied to us!

23
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:42,000
He called Han Chuan out!

24
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Yes!

25
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Call him out!

26
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Call him out!

27
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Call him out!

28
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Call him out!

29
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Call him out!

30
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Call him out!

31
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Call him out!

32
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Call him out!

33
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Calm down!

34
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Calm down!

35
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Calm down!

36
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Calm down!

37
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,000
We know it!

38
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,000
We know it!

39
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Call him out!

40
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Calm down!

41
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Hello, everyone!

42
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
I'm the director of our police station!

43
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
If you have any requests,

44
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
you can talk to me, okay?

45
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,000
Talk about what?

46
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Han Chuan came out!

47
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
We just recognize his face!

48
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
He lied to us!

49
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Call him out!

50
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Call him out!

51
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,000
Call him out!

52
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Call him out!

53
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Don't let Yan Yan out!

54
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Calm down!

55
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Calm down!

56
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
I understand your feelings!

57
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:26,000
But you can't solve the problem even if you look for him now!

58
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,000
I promise you!

59
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,000
We will do our best to catch the real murderer!

60
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
We will help you get the money back!

61
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:37,000
And we will do our best to help you find the kids!

62
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:40,000
We have a population data database of the entire country!

63
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
If you are willing,

64
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
let's go to collect DNA now!

65
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Let's compare!

66
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Okay?

67
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,000
I don't care!

68
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Call him out!

69
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Give us back our money!

70
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Give us back our money!

71
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Give us back our money!

72
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Give us back our money!

73
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Give us back our money!

74
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Give us back our money!

75
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Give us back our money!

76
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Give us back our money!

77
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Give us back our money!

78
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Give us back our money!

79
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Give us back our money!

80
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Give us back our money!

81
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Give us back our money!

82
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Give us back our money!

83
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
I will explain it to them in person!

84
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,000
They are so angry now!

85
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,000
You want to go out?

86
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
I can do anything!

87
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
But I can't let them throw dirty water on this police uniform!

88
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,000
The purpose of the funeral is to take your uniform!

89
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Aren't you going out with the doctor now?

90
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,000
How many people are there in the area?

91
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Why can't we bear it now?

92
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Look at them!

93
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
They lost the kid

94
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:26,080
The evidence is gone.

95
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:27,780
meter by meter.

96
00:02:34,140 --> 00:02:48,760
Sche love

97
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Cheers!

98
00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:11,960
You're not farsighted.

99
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:14,080
I don't believe her.

100
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:15,560
You don't see Chengcheng anymore?

101
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:21,880
You've grown taller.

102
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:26,600
You're fatter.

103
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:28,200
You have more meat on your face.

104
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:34,480
Your lips

105
00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:36,680
are a little thin.

106
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:38,520
You're a little skinny.

107
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:40,040
Stop talking.

108
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:47,120
Your nose

109
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:49,000
is still so high.

110
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:49,960
Your eyes...

111
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:50,760
Stop talking.

112
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:53,720
You look

113
00:03:53,720 --> 00:03:55,160
like a child

114
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:56,720
with a little bit of a temper.

115
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:58,480
I told you to stop talking.

116
00:04:01,640 --> 00:04:02,920
That's not our Chengcheng.

117
00:04:02,920 --> 00:04:03,640
That's a fake Chengcheng

118
00:04:03,640 --> 00:04:04,320
in the computer.

119
00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:05,120
It's fake.

120
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:06,040
Don't you know?

121
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:19,960
Impossible.

122
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:25,520
It's impossible.

123
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:32,640
Impossible.

124
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:39,520
I can't.

125
00:04:53,720 --> 00:05:18,840
실망

126
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:54,920
Hurry, eat first.

127
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:11,560
I've made a deal with them.

128
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:14,720
Direct them to sign.

129
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:18,240
They'll sign the contract tomorrow.

130
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:20,080
Okay.

131
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:23,400
Tomorrow...

132
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:25,280
Let's not wait.

133
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:28,280
After we finish the shop,

134
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:31,480
we'll go to find the baby.

135
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:33,720
Okay.

136
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:50,280
We'll go around the country

137
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:52,600
to find the baby.

138
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:24,280
Okay.

139
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:30,480
Coming.

140
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:55,520
Chenchen.

141
00:07:56,440 --> 00:07:57,840
It's you, Chenchen.

142
00:07:58,480 --> 00:07:59,960
I finally found you.

143
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:09,640
Chenchen.

144
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:13,960
It's you, Chenchen.

145
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:16,160
I finally found you.

146
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:25,600
Thank you, Mr. Minghao.

147
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:26,800
Thank you.

148
00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:28,040
Hello, Ms. An.

149
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:50,800
I'm Han Chun, a police officer at the Anti-?

150
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:55,280
Wake up!

151
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:56,960
Anpan.

152
00:08:58,040 --> 00:08:58,840
Chenchen.

153
00:08:59,200 --> 00:08:59,840
Anpan.

154
00:09:01,280 --> 00:09:02,640
Anpan, wake up.

155
00:09:06,280 --> 00:09:08,120
Anpan, what's wrong?

156
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:15,520
What's wrong?

157
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:19,520
Are you okay?

158
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:20,400
Anpan.

159
00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:24,280
Yes.

160
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:29,840
Anpan.

161
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:39,760
Anpan.

162
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:40,560
Anpan.

163
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:41,080
Anpan.

164
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:41,880
Anpan.

165
00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:46,320
Don't talk to your mom like that.

166
00:09:49,520 --> 00:09:50,800
Anpan.

167
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:19,120
Anpan.

168
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:20,720
Anpan.

169
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:22,720
Anpan.

170
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:39,920
meva diga.

171
00:10:40,520 --> 00:10:42,160
Why did you make so many dishes?

172
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:47,280
My dear.

173
00:10:49,520 --> 00:10:50,520
An Ning

174
00:10:51,520 --> 00:10:52,520
An Ning

175
00:10:54,520 --> 00:10:55,520
An Ning

176
00:10:56,520 --> 00:10:57,520
An Ning

177
00:10:57,520 --> 00:10:59,520
Where have you been?

178
00:10:59,520 --> 00:11:01,520
I went to buy some oranges on the way

179
00:11:01,520 --> 00:11:02,520
What's wrong?

180
00:11:04,520 --> 00:11:05,520
Nothing

181
00:11:06,520 --> 00:11:07,520
I was so scared

182
00:11:08,520 --> 00:11:09,520
Let's eat

183
00:11:09,520 --> 00:11:10,520
Okay

184
00:11:10,520 --> 00:11:11,520
Okay

185
00:11:18,520 --> 00:11:20,520
Why did you cook so many dishes today?

186
00:11:25,520 --> 00:11:26,520
Honey

187
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:28,520
I've figured it out

188
00:11:28,520 --> 00:11:30,520
No matter if the child can be found

189
00:11:30,520 --> 00:11:32,520
The adult's life must go on

190
00:11:33,520 --> 00:11:35,520
You can't be proud of our family

191
00:11:35,520 --> 00:11:36,520
We can't be proud of anyone

192
00:11:39,520 --> 00:11:41,520
We can't be proud of anyone

193
00:11:46,520 --> 00:11:47,520
You clean up after eating

194
00:11:47,520 --> 00:11:49,520
I'll go to the fish house

195
00:11:49,520 --> 00:11:50,520
No need

196
00:11:50,520 --> 00:11:51,520
I'll go

197
00:11:51,520 --> 00:11:53,520
Don't you have to return all these goods?

198
00:11:53,520 --> 00:11:55,520
I'll go, it's okay

199
00:11:58,520 --> 00:11:59,520
Okay

200
00:12:00,520 --> 00:12:01,520
Eat

201
00:12:05,520 --> 00:12:06,520
Okay

202
00:12:35,520 --> 00:12:36,520
Okay

203
00:14:05,520 --> 00:14:07,520
Goodbye

204
00:15:05,520 --> 00:15:08,520
The light scatters in the night

205
00:15:08,520 --> 00:15:12,520
The fireflies will shine

206
00:15:12,520 --> 00:15:19,520
Light up the road and take the caravan

207
00:15:19,520 --> 00:15:26,520
I'm drifting with you in the wind

208
00:15:26,520 --> 00:15:33,520
I'm floating in the dust

209
00:15:33,520 --> 00:15:34,320
The

210
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:37,520
balance of the waves

211
00:15:37,520 --> 00:15:40,520
The whirlpool above

212
00:15:40,520 --> 00:15:50,520
It's clear that it's never been clouded
