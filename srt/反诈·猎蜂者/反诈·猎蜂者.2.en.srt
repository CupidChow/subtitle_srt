00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
The King of Blaze

00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Episode 16

3
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Sister Zhang.

4
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Sister Zhang, don't hit me.

5
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Sister Zhang, don't hit me.

6
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Please, sister Zhang.

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Sister Zhang, don't hit me.

8
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Sister Zhang, don't hit me.

9
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,000
I'll give you a beating.

10
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Help me.

11
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
I'll kill you.

12
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,000
I'll kill you.

13
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000
I'll kill you.

14
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Su Yan.

15
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Time is wasted.

16
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:48,000
When you were engaged,

17
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,000
didn't you say

18
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
you had won a gold medal?

19
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
At this level?

20
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Sister Zhang.

21
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,000
I don't know if you want

22
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,000
something or not.

23
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,000
If you give me something,

24
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,000
I'll try my best to give it to you.

25
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,000
What are you doing?

26
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,000
You're so noisy.

27
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Help me.

28
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Help me.

29
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Help me.

30
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Sister Zhang.

31
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Help me.

32
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
It's all her fault that we survived.

33
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,000
She's the strongest person

34
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
in our school.

35
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,000
Think about it.

36
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,000
She must be able to

37
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,000
make the A2C you want

38
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,000
come true.

39
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Sister Zhang, don't hit me.

40
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:28,000
I'll help you.

41
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
I'll help you.

42
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Brother, you can't be late

43
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
for my graduation ceremony.

44
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,000
I've prepared a big surprise for you.

45
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Bailing.

46
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Where have you been these days?

47
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,000
I called you but you didn't answer.

48
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
You know I'm worried about you.

49
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
I lost my phone

50
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
when I was on duty two days ago.

51
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,000
I just found it.

52
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Wait.

53
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,000
What's wrong with your injury?

54
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Did someone bully you?

55
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Who can bully me?

56
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,000
I fell down

57
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
when I was riding the electric car

58
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,000
two days ago.

59
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,000
It's okay.

60
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,000
I'll call the teacher

61
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,000
and tell him I'm safe.

62
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,000
No.

63
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
I'll call the teacher

64
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,000
and tell him I'm safe tomorrow.

65
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Don't worry.

66
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000
I brought you a medicine box.

67
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
I'll wipe it for you when you're asleep.

68
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
It's okay.

69
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,000
It's just a small wound.

70
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
I'll clean it up myself.

71
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Thank you, Xiaoxiao.

72
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,000
It's okay.

73
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
I'll clean it up myself.

74
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,000
It's okay.

75
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
I'll clean it up myself.

76
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
It's okay.

77
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,000
I'll clean it up myself.

78
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,000
It's okay.

79
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,000
I'll clean it up myself.

80
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,000
It's okay.

81
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,000
I'll clean it up myself.

82
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,000
It's okay.

83
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,000
I'll clean it up myself.

84
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,000
It's okay.

85
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,000
I'll clean it up myself.

86
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,000
It's okay.

87
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,000
I'll clean it up myself.

88
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,000
It's okay.

89
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
I'll clean it up myself.

90
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
It's okay.

91
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
I'll clean it up myself.

92
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,000
It's okay.

93
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
I'll clean it up myself.

94
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000
It's okay.

95
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,000
I'll clean it up myself.

96
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
It's okay.

97
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
I'll clean it up myself.

98
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
It's okay.

99
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
I'll clean it up myself.

100
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
It's okay.

101
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
I'll clean it up myself.

102
00:03:53,720 --> 00:03:54,880
You are extremely cold.

103
00:03:54,880 --> 00:03:56,000
You are extremely cold.

104
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
It's so expensive.

105
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,400
There's still so much to go

106
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:25,280
He Xiaoxiao

107
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:27,280
He Xiaoxiao, please

108
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:29,400
You can't escape

109
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:32,120
I'll send someone to keep an eye on you

110
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:34,240
and your family

111
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:47,840
You're awake?

112
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:51,360
Come down and have dinner

113
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,440
Okay

114
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:27,620
Sister, younger sister, I think you should give her more training alone.

115
00:05:29,420 --> 00:05:32,120
Okay, I'll do my best.

116
00:05:34,300 --> 00:05:37,000
Okay, I'll send her off sometime.

117
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:41,120
I'm going to focus on smash her, everyone.

118
00:05:41,420 --> 00:05:42,500
Okay.

119
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:46,420
I'm going to put some decoction in her mouth while making her bars melt.

120
00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:47,100
Okay.

121
00:05:47,100 --> 00:05:48,740
If you keep doing this,

122
00:05:49,100 --> 00:05:50,260
I'll be upset.

123
00:05:57,580 --> 00:06:01,300
You said you're here for the fraud.

124
00:06:02,140 --> 00:06:03,660
I trusted you so much.

125
00:06:05,020 --> 00:06:05,740
Sister,

126
00:06:06,460 --> 00:06:08,100
I've told you many times.

127
00:06:08,540 --> 00:06:11,500
We invited you here to develop AI software.

128
00:06:12,180 --> 00:06:13,460
We're not here for the fraud.

129
00:06:14,460 --> 00:06:15,420
You're dreaming.

130
00:06:15,860 --> 00:06:17,900
I've given you two days.

131
00:06:18,420 --> 00:06:19,620
If you're still so stubborn,

132
00:06:20,900 --> 00:06:23,420
then go to the grave and bury me.

133
00:06:26,980 --> 00:06:28,100
As for this,

134
00:06:28,340 --> 00:06:30,140
take it with you to continue making movies.

135
00:06:31,060 --> 00:06:32,100
Sister, sister.

136
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:32,980
He's still angry.

137
00:06:32,980 --> 00:06:33,940
He doesn't understand the rules.

138
00:06:33,940 --> 00:06:35,420
I'll talk to him when I get back.

139
00:06:35,780 --> 00:06:36,580
And sister,

140
00:06:36,580 --> 00:06:38,380
you promised me that you wouldn't do anything.

141
00:06:38,380 --> 00:06:39,020
Sister.

142
00:06:39,700 --> 00:06:41,780
How dare you talk like that?

143
00:07:13,540 --> 00:07:15,100
Will I hurt you?

144
00:07:20,020 --> 00:07:20,900
Take her away.

145
00:07:30,060 --> 00:07:31,060
I'm in your serve!

146
00:07:32,700 --> 00:07:33,620
Another one?

147
00:07:34,220 --> 00:07:34,860
Yes.

148
00:07:35,100 --> 00:07:36,300
I already slipped.

149
00:07:37,820 --> 00:07:39,780
Okay, I'm everytime Arms Up.

150
00:07:41,540 --> 00:07:43,420
This is the only way for me to pass spicy civil • ♥

151
00:07:43,460 --> 00:07:45,460
Demon Chicken.

152
00:07:45,460 --> 00:07:47,860
There are a lot of Demon Chicken in this area.

153
00:07:47,860 --> 00:07:51,060
I heard that two years ago, the Buddha tree killed the whole family.

154
00:07:51,060 --> 00:07:52,660
He even became the boss.

155
00:07:52,660 --> 00:07:54,060
Let me tell you.

156
00:07:54,060 --> 00:07:57,660
Actually, he didn't destroy the whole family.

157
00:07:57,660 --> 00:08:00,660
The boss even had a illegitimate child.

158
00:08:00,660 --> 00:08:02,060
You're still not familiar with the name.

159
00:08:02,060 --> 00:08:03,860
You even have a very loud mouth.

160
00:08:03,860 --> 00:08:05,460
A Buddha tree.

161
00:08:05,460 --> 00:08:07,860
You two are like college girls.

162
00:08:07,860 --> 00:08:10,660
I'll find a pit in the back mountain to buy you a grave.

163
00:08:10,660 --> 00:08:12,860
I'll personally dig you a hole.

164
00:08:13,260 --> 00:08:14,660
Brother Rui, you're wrong.

165
00:08:14,660 --> 00:08:16,860
You're wrong.

166
00:08:17,460 --> 00:08:20,460
Brother, is that college girl really buried?

167
00:08:20,460 --> 00:08:23,460
She was buried. But she didn't die.

168
00:08:24,860 --> 00:08:25,660
Where is the girl?

169
00:08:25,660 --> 00:08:27,060
You're everywhere, aren't you?

170
00:08:27,060 --> 00:08:28,860
Don't move!

171
00:08:33,260 --> 00:08:35,860
What do you want?

172
00:08:35,860 --> 00:08:36,860
Let me tell you.

173
00:08:36,860 --> 00:08:39,460
You should know who's in charge here.

174
00:08:39,460 --> 00:08:41,660
Tomorrow, you should go to the canteen with me.

175
00:08:41,660 --> 00:08:44,260
If you cause trouble, I'll chop you up.

176
00:08:44,260 --> 00:08:46,460
Do you hear me?

177
00:08:46,460 --> 00:08:48,460
What's your name?

178
00:08:53,260 --> 00:08:55,860
What's your name? Are you still thinking?

179
00:08:57,060 --> 00:08:59,260
Shisan.

180
00:08:59,260 --> 00:09:01,860
Of course, my brother is proud of me.

181
00:09:01,860 --> 00:09:04,460
He called me Brother Shisan.

182
00:09:06,460 --> 00:09:09,060
I think you look like Brother Bi.

183
00:09:09,060 --> 00:09:10,860
Brother Bi.

184
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:14,660
Am I the Amit Bitter Gabriel?

185
00:09:18,740 --> 00:09:20,340
No one knows.

186
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:25,760
I don't.

187
00:09:28,460 --> 00:09:30,660
I certainly don't.

188
00:09:32,660 --> 00:09:41,240
Even if you do, it's probably

189
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:43,240
Hit him! Don't stop me!

190
00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:44,680
Let's go out and take a look.

191
00:09:44,680 --> 00:09:45,680
You're not listening!

192
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:47,880
Don't hit him!

193
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:48,880
Wait!

194
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:49,880
Don't hit him!

195
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:50,880
Hit him!

196
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:51,880
Hit him!

197
00:09:51,880 --> 00:09:52,880
Don't hit him!

198
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:53,880
Hit him!

199
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:54,880
You're not listening!

200
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:55,880
I'll kill you!

201
00:09:55,880 --> 00:09:57,880
Hit him!

202
00:09:57,880 --> 00:09:59,880
Hit him!

203
00:09:59,880 --> 00:10:00,880
Don't hit him!

204
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:02,880
Hit him!

205
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:03,880
Hit him!

206
00:10:03,880 --> 00:10:04,880
Hit him!

207
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:05,880
Hit him!

208
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:06,880
Harder!

209
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:08,880
I still have a good chance!

210
00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:13,880
Hit him!

211
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:15,880
Hit him!

212
00:10:15,880 --> 00:10:17,880
Hit him!

213
00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:19,880
Brother, it's you!

214
00:10:19,880 --> 00:10:20,880
Why are you here?

215
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:22,880
The next day after we broke up,

216
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:24,880
I wanted to buy a ticket back to China.

217
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:26,880
But they sold it to me.

218
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:28,880
Brother, why are you here?

219
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:34,880
I was trying to get money, but I ran out of it.

220
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:36,880
I wanted to do a part-time job, but I was dragged into this.

221
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:37,880
Okay.

222
00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:39,880
Brother, I'm sorry.

223
00:10:40,520 --> 00:10:42,520
I got you into trouble.

224
00:10:48,520 --> 00:10:50,520
Brother, Brother 13, I'm done.

225
00:10:50,520 --> 00:10:52,520
I'm done for.

226
00:10:57,520 --> 00:10:59,520
Brother 13,

227
00:10:59,520 --> 00:11:01,520
thanks to you,

228
00:11:01,520 --> 00:11:03,520
I'm Sang Tuo.

229
00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:05,520
If you need anything, just let me know.

230
00:11:05,520 --> 00:11:07,520
What do you want?

231
00:11:07,520 --> 00:11:09,520
Brother,

232
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:12,160
I'm not blind.

233
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:14,160
I can't let Brother 13 burn potatoes.

234
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:16,160
Hurry up!

235
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:18,160
Get up!

236
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:20,160
Brother, hurry up!

237
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:22,160
These people are not sensible.

238
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:24,160
If you need anything, just let me know.

239
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:26,160
I'm good at it.

240
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:28,160
Let me do it.

241
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:30,160
Thanks, Brother.

242
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:34,160
The girls here

243
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:36,160
are only those who come to the canteen to eat.

244
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:38,160
Brother, I can't tell.

245
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:40,800
Brother,

246
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:42,800
we're all men.

247
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:44,800
Tell me.

248
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:46,800
We have cameras everywhere in our district.

249
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:48,800
The girls are on the sixth floor.

250
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:50,800
It's not easy to get to the sixth floor.

251
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:52,800
Sixth floor?

252
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:54,800
Why not?

253
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:56,800
You need to get good grades.

254
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:58,800
If you get more than 5 million,

255
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:00,800
you can get an A-card and allow six-level freedom.

256
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:02,800
You can get massage, singing, whatever.

257
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:04,800
If your grades reach 20 million,

258
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:06,800
you can get an S-card.

259
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:09,440
Sixth floor is the only place you can get free.

260
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:11,440
You can even get a lift to the top floor.

261
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:13,440
It's more exciting.

262
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:15,440
It's just a pity.

263
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:17,440
Our canteen is full of dirty work.

264
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:19,440
There's no performance to do.

265
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:21,440
So you want to go up,

266
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:23,440
but only the road to performance.

267
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:25,440
The company doesn't open a restaurant.

268
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:27,440
What about the lift?

269
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:29,440
There's a security guard in the lift.

270
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:31,440
It takes 24 hours to get there.

271
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:33,440
If you go to the floor that doesn't belong to you,

272
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:35,440
they'll shoot you.

273
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:38,080
When can you stop?

274
00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:40,080
When can you stop looking for girls?

275
00:12:40,080 --> 00:12:42,080
You can't kill yourself.

276
00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:44,080
Why are the girls who come down to eat so stupid?

277
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:46,080
The situation is different.

278
00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:48,080
Some are locked up.

279
00:12:48,080 --> 00:12:50,080
Some are being tortured.

280
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:52,080
Here, cheers.

281
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:54,080
Xiaoxiao must be in the sixth floor.

282
00:12:54,080 --> 00:12:56,080
I need to find a way to get up there.

283
00:12:56,080 --> 00:12:58,080
Go.

284
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:02,080
Hurry up.

285
00:13:02,080 --> 00:13:04,080
We have to go. We have to work.

286
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:06,720
Bye.

287
00:13:19,720 --> 00:13:21,720
Erping.

288
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:23,720
Beifei.

289
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:29,720
Here.

290
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:31,720
The sign.

291
00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:33,720
Xiaoxiao.

292
00:13:34,360 --> 00:13:36,360
Look, Erui.

293
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:38,360
Do you think I'm going to be a good guy?

294
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:40,360
You are.

295
00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:42,360
I'm really going to be a good guy.

296
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:44,360
Xiong, I'm sorry.

297
00:13:44,360 --> 00:13:46,360
Come on.

298
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:48,360
Give me the money.

299
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:50,360
I don't believe you.

300
00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:52,360
Come on.

301
00:13:52,360 --> 00:13:54,360
Give me the card.

302
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:56,360
Xiong is not good today.

303
00:13:56,360 --> 00:13:58,360
Very good.

304
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,000
Come on.

305
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,000
Xiong, you have to pay for this card.

306
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,000
As if Yin Hongsheng already left you.

307
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,000
For the drug.

308
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,800
When did he knew that you came to the entertainment industry?

309
00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:37,800
Today at 19.

310
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:39,800
Right.

311
00:14:39,800 --> 00:14:41,800
dominated in the night party.

312
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:45,660
Ra enjoys it so much that he

313
00:14:45,660 --> 00:14:48,980
might as well give it up to you.

314
00:14:49,180 --> 00:14:50,820
Now...

315
00:14:50,820 --> 00:14:54,300
You might as well play with me.

316
00:14:54,300 --> 00:14:56,200
Get on her engine.

317
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:29,200
The lights are scattered in the night

318
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:33,200
The fireflies are flickering

319
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:40,200
The light is all over the place

320
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:46,200
The clouds are in the wind

321
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:54,200
The waves are drifting in the city

322
00:15:55,200 --> 00:16:02,200
The waves are drifting in the city

323
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:12,200
The clouds are in the wind
