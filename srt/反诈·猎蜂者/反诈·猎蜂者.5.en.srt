00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
The Taoism Grandmaster

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Episode 16

3
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:31,460
Jin Mi,

4
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:33,000
go.

5
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:33,920
No.

6
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:35,480
I DevOps,

7
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:39,040
I can take care of myself.

8
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:39,840
Come on.

9
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:41,000
Jin Mi,

10
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:42,760
do you think I cannot take care of you

11
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:44,520
for ten years?

12
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:54,000
Change?

13
00:00:55,720 --> 00:00:56,280
Yes.

14
00:00:58,080 --> 00:00:59,080
Come on.

15
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,200
When the medicine is ready, send it to Sister Zha.

16
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:05,880
If you send it to the sixth floor, you won't make money.

17
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:07,680
You can still sell it to Sister Zha.

18
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:08,600
Understand?

19
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:09,680
I understand, Brother Hai.

20
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:11,400
Okay.

21
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:14,080
Yang Mei Zi.

22
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:32,280
Hey.

23
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:34,320
You're reading an English book?

24
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:36,440
Can you read it?

25
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:43,120
What's wrong?

26
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:45,680
Who's bothering you again?

27
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:48,400
Do we have to go to the second floor?

28
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:53,720
You don't want to leave?

29
00:01:55,760 --> 00:01:58,720
To be honest, I've always thought you're not bad.

30
00:01:58,760 --> 00:02:01,080
The people on the second floor are all bad people.

31
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:04,240
They're all bad people.

32
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:06,120
They run a gambling club every month.

33
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:08,680
They're using deceit as a means to win.

34
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:10,320
They don't take people as people.

35
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:12,360
Brother, don't worry.

36
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:14,360
I know what I'm doing.

37
00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:17,560
By the way, how did you get in?

38
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:19,880
They tricked me too.

39
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:21,840
Don't talk about me, Brother.

40
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:25,640
I heard that a client of Black Ghost Cave

41
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:29,400
is a little girl who gave her mother money to treat her illness.

42
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:31,680
She's not a talent. She's a dreamer.

43
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:34,120
She's going to get retribution sooner or later.

44
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:36,600
I'm really afraid that you'll be on the second floor

45
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:39,080
like the people on the second floor.

46
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:42,120
How many girls are you aware of who are being watched by Black Ghost Cave?

47
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:46,600
I heard that it's a college student from Jiang Hai.

48
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:47,440
Poor him.

49
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:48,520
Jiang Hai?

50
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:50,880
Brother, can we not change the topic?

51
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:52,440
I'm sincerely advising you.

52
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:54,320
If you have any problems, just tell me.

53
00:02:54,320 --> 00:02:55,960
I'll solve them for you.

54
00:02:55,960 --> 00:02:58,920
Brother, don't persuade me.

55
00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:01,320
I must go up to the second floor.

56
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:05,440
But I promise you that I won't harm anyone.

57
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:08,800
Is this what you said, Brother?

58
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:22,200
What is it? Open it.

59
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:24,640
Didn't you change your clothes?

60
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:26,160
I wore these before.

61
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:27,640
Take them.

62
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:32,400
Can I wear your clothes?

63
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:34,120
Brother, you don't know that.

64
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:37,640
I was as handsome as you were.

65
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:39,920
Really, Brother.

66
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:41,520
Thank you, Brother.

67
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:51,640
Brother, I heard that you're going to the second floor.

68
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:53,520
Take me with you.

69
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:55,440
I'm very capable.

70
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:59,240
I'm telling you, you don't know that there are many bad guys on the second floor.

71
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:00,880
Every one of us is being watched by them.

72
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:02,840
It's easy to be bullied.

73
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:04,400
How about it?

74
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:07,680
No need. I can go by myself.

75
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:17,280
Brother Wei, help me persuade him.

76
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:19,840
Let's go up there and help Brother 13.

77
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:20,600
I'm not going.

78
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:21,840
Are you my brother?

79
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:23,000
You can go if you want.

80
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,480
I'm in the canteen. I won't go anywhere.

81
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:25,880
You!

82
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:33,000
Brother, I'll go if he doesn't go.

83
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,520
I don't care. I've decided.

84
00:04:34,520 --> 00:04:36,760
You have to take me with you no matter what.

85
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:54,240
Po nazi

86
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:55,760
It sounds like they were playing,

87
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:56,520
the place thatCheng Jian Majesty

88
00:04:56,520 --> 00:04:58,240
into every alleyways immediately.

89
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:10,960
My變成

90
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:12,920
is that

91
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:14,680
humanity

92
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:19,440
became

93
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:20,480
very succeed.

94
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,280
I am so excited.

95
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:23,200
to this place.

96
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,760
This is your work.

97
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:28,000
Dong,

98
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:29,720
we'll only play this poor student

99
00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:31,880
in this game.

100
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:34,160
He doesn't have the money he wants.

101
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:35,800
But

102
00:05:36,520 --> 00:05:38,520
he gave his mother the money to save her life.

103
00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:40,320
He never lost.

104
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:42,840
This time,

105
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:44,640
we'll win.

106
00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:46,560
Is this the Black Ghost Dong

107
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:47,840
who is in the same team with Hai?

108
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:48,600
Yes.

109
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:49,800
You're so stupid.

110
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:53,640
Who are you talking about?

111
00:05:57,200 --> 00:05:58,000
It's you.

112
00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:07,640
Dong,

113
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:09,720
my name is 13.

114
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:14,760
I'm busy.

115
00:06:14,760 --> 00:06:15,800
What are you doing?

116
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:16,720
Don't touch me.

117
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:17,520
I'm not.

118
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:18,560
What are you doing?

119
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:19,560
Don't touch me.

120
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:30,400
Dong,

121
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:32,000
you're such a stupid client.

122
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,360
You're still taking it as a treasure.

123
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:35,040
Are you trying to kill me?

124
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:36,560
I told you not to touch me.

125
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:37,240
What's wrong?

126
00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:39,080
Uncle Fu is here.

127
00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:39,960
What are you doing?

128
00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:41,760
It's so lively here.

129
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:43,800
Come here.

130
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:45,440
Who is this?

131
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:47,360
Uncle Fu.

132
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:48,680
Uncle Fu.

133
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:52,640
Uncle Fu.

134
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:58,040
Do you have any good news

135
00:06:58,360 --> 00:06:59,400
to clear up?

136
00:06:59,400 --> 00:06:59,920
Uncle Fu.

137
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:00,560
No.

138
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:01,160
No, Uncle Fu.

139
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:01,520
We are...

140
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:02,120
Uncle Fu.

141
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:03,000
They did it first.

142
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:03,640
They want to fight.

143
00:07:03,640 --> 00:07:04,640
They bullied us.

144
00:07:04,640 --> 00:07:05,360
Don't touch me.

145
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:09,840
Don't always fight and kill.

146
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:12,920
Everyone is here

147
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:15,600
to make money.

148
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:17,960
Only by making peace

149
00:07:18,760 --> 00:07:20,800
can we make money.

150
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:22,400
Uncle Fu,

151
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:24,960
they are new to the school.

152
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:26,880
We were just kidding.

153
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:27,840
We didn't want to fight.

154
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:29,720
We were in a hurry.

155
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:32,800
Uncle Fu,

156
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:37,720
I've been looking up to Dong for a long time.

157
00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:40,000
I want to learn from him.

158
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:41,280
I'm sorry, Uncle Fu.

159
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:42,880
They are new here.

160
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:43,800
They don't know the rules.

161
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:45,640
I'll teach them later.

162
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:47,320
I'm sorry.

163
00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:50,360
It's normal for young people

164
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:52,400
to be strong.

165
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:55,680
Well,

166
00:07:56,920 --> 00:08:00,360
the bet of your two teams

167
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:02,640
is one point.

168
00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:05,320
The whole team's

169
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:07,200
monthly promotion

170
00:08:07,880 --> 00:08:10,080
is three points.

171
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:13,040
Thank you, Uncle Fu.

172
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:14,680
Good.

173
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:15,680
Thank you, Uncle Fu.

174
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:16,880
Of course.

175
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:18,960
The losing team

176
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:22,480
will be punished a little.

177
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:25,320
Then,

178
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:27,560
you'll be punished.

179
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:35,080
Hai,

180
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:38,160
since these two kids

181
00:08:38,160 --> 00:08:39,160
want to perform,

182
00:08:39,480 --> 00:08:42,160
give them a chance.

183
00:08:44,280 --> 00:08:45,520
I don't care.

184
00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:46,800
I don't care.

185
00:08:47,280 --> 00:08:47,840
I have no problem.

186
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:48,480
Alright.

187
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:49,280
You can continue.

188
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:51,600
Uncle Fu, take care.

189
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:53,840
You've been messing with me since you were young.

190
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:55,080
You've been messing with me since you were young.

191
00:08:55,560 --> 00:08:56,440
I've got it this time.

192
00:08:56,840 --> 00:08:57,840
It seems that someone is going to die.

193
00:08:59,240 --> 00:08:59,920
Get to work.

194
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:03,040
Sister Li.

195
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:04,960
You're right.

196
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:05,960
It's a good thing.

197
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:06,720
Yes.

198
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:07,680
It's a good thing.

199
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:08,440
It's a good thing.

200
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:09,440
It's a good thing.

201
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:10,320
It's a good thing.

202
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:11,280
It's a good thing.

203
00:09:11,280 --> 00:09:12,160
It's a good thing.

204
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:13,640
It's a good thing.

205
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:15,080
Who's going to die here?

206
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:16,560
Don't be so fierce.

207
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:17,200
Zhe Cai.

208
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:18,600
You'll get your information from here.

209
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:19,280
Right?

210
00:09:19,280 --> 00:09:19,880
Right?

211
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:22,040
This is the best

212
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:23,560
of our team.

213
00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:26,080
You're the one who made trouble.

214
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:27,800
Tomorrow at 12 o'clock,

215
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:30,040
you'll decide the winner and the loser.

216
00:09:31,160 --> 00:09:32,480
Don't say I didn't help you.

217
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:33,640
Hurry up.

218
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:35,280
If you lose,

219
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:36,400
you'll lose your face.

220
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:42,280
Alright.

221
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:46,280
Don't push each other.

222
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:49,200
I'll go down the river myself.

223
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:50,800
If we win,

224
00:09:51,280 --> 00:09:52,560
we'll make money together.

225
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:54,240
If we lose,

226
00:09:55,480 --> 00:09:56,480
I'll take care of myself.

227
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:57,480
Besides,

228
00:09:58,360 --> 00:10:00,600
when did we lose to Ba Sihai?

229
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:04,280
Come on.

230
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:05,440
Get to work.

231
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:07,600
Get to work.

232
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:15,200
Brother.

233
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:17,000
If you need anything,

234
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:18,680
just tell me. I'll do it.

235
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:19,760
It's okay.

236
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:21,520
I'll take care of some things.

237
00:11:14,220 --> 00:11:37,400
Brother Xin ¡© underestimates Ma questo

238
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:41,160
Brother!

239
00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:41,960
Brother,

240
00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:43,160
stop jumping

241
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:44,360
Pick one to start with.

242
00:11:44,680 --> 00:11:45,720
We're running out of time.

243
00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:47,120
Brother Hai said

244
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:48,240
these are all high-end materials.

245
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:49,920
Stop picking and picking, okay?

246
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:52,080
Why are you panicking?

247
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:55,400
Find me a police uniform.

248
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:57,200
A police uniform?

249
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:06,320
Brother,

250
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:08,320
you really look like a police officer.

251
00:12:13,540 --> 00:12:14,680
You should be eating some snacks.

252
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:35,080
Once you wear these clothes

253
00:12:35,520 --> 00:12:37,040
you become so much more authentic than real police officers.

254
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:38,720
This is interesting.

255
00:12:39,640 --> 00:12:40,760
He really likes

256
00:12:40,920 --> 00:12:42,480
to mimic cause and effect.

257
00:12:42,760 --> 00:12:43,920
what gives

258
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:45,880
Just cover it

259
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:13,320
I like her a lot.

260
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:34,000
Hello.

261
00:13:34,360 --> 00:13:35,400
Are you Chen Lian?

262
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:37,680
This is the Kleptuder Company in Jianghai City.

263
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:38,880
Sixteen, 고양이,

264
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,760
No.761785.

265
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:41,880
Centre Twelfth,

266
00:13:41,880 --> 00:13:43,200
You forgot about the money?

267
00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:45,240
Let me remind you.

268
00:13:45,880 --> 00:13:47,120
You bought a can of milk powder.

269
00:13:48,440 --> 00:13:49,880
I really didn't buy it.

270
00:13:50,520 --> 00:13:51,040
By the way,

271
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:52,640
my husband probably bought it.

272
00:13:52,920 --> 00:13:53,920
What's wrong, officer?

273
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:55,920
We found out that

274
00:13:56,080 --> 00:13:56,960
there's a haploid in this can of milk powder.

275
00:13:57,160 --> 00:13:58,560
It's suspected of being a drug deal.

276
00:13:58,880 --> 00:13:59,840
Impossible.

277
00:14:00,280 --> 00:14:01,920
Officer, you must be mistaken.

278
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:03,560
I can't be.

279
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:05,000
It's either you or your husband.

280
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:07,160
My husband?

281
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:08,280
Because the drug deal

282
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:09,240
is your account,

283
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:10,840
you're the first suspect.

284
00:14:11,880 --> 00:14:12,720
I'm sorry.

285
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:14,360
Ms. Shen,

286
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:15,800
I'm sending you

287
00:14:15,960 --> 00:14:16,760
the criminal record

288
00:14:16,920 --> 00:14:17,880
of the case against you

289
00:14:18,040 --> 00:14:19,000
in our city.

290
00:14:19,160 --> 00:14:20,640
If you have any other questions,

291
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:22,080
you can click the link

292
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:23,920
and check it on the official website

293
00:14:24,080 --> 00:14:24,920
of Jianghai Public Security Bureau.

294
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:25,800
Next,

295
00:14:25,960 --> 00:14:27,480
I'll interview you.

296
00:14:27,960 --> 00:14:29,480
You need to find a quiet place

297
00:14:29,640 --> 00:14:30,840
and open the official website

298
00:14:31,080 --> 00:14:31,800
and download the official website

299
00:14:31,960 --> 00:14:33,320
of the public security bureau.

300
00:14:39,080 --> 00:14:40,200
Officer,

301
00:14:40,520 --> 00:14:41,240
my husband and I

302
00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:42,880
are always so

303
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:45,040
ungrateful.

304
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:46,440
What else did he say?

305
00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:48,560
He asked me to download a video

306
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:49,640
and call software.

307
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:51,600
He said he wanted to interrogate me with a video.

308
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:53,520
I don't know

309
00:14:53,880 --> 00:14:55,640
how I could believe him.

310
00:14:56,440 --> 00:14:58,720
He was also deceived by 9999 yuan.

311
00:14:59,840 --> 00:15:01,320
9999 yuan?

312
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:03,880
He didn't just cheat me with money.

313
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:05,960
He even wrote a post to scold me.

314
00:15:08,920 --> 00:15:09,960
What post?

315
00:15:10,520 --> 00:15:11,160
You don't know

316
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:12,960
how bad he scolded me.

317
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:16,040
He said I was like a snake

318
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:17,520
that crawls to the far east

319
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:20,440
and swims into the lake

320
00:15:20,760 --> 00:15:22,080
with a greedy heart.

321
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:23,360
To be honest,

322
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:24,680
this money is not much

323
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:26,040
to me.

324
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:27,120
But he...

325
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:28,480
He didn't just cheat me with money.

326
00:15:28,640 --> 00:15:29,800
He even scolded me.

327
00:15:29,960 --> 00:15:30,520
Ms. Chen,

328
00:15:30,680 --> 00:15:31,240
you can go back

329
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:32,040
and wait for our news.

330
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:33,120
Okay, thank you.

331
00:15:34,640 --> 00:15:35,280
Captain An,

332
00:15:35,840 --> 00:15:36,520
another two people

333
00:15:36,680 --> 00:15:37,920
were all deceived by the police.

334
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:40,160
The amount of money was also 9999 yuan.

335
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:40,960
What?

336
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:42,680
It was all 9999 yuan?

337
00:15:42,840 --> 00:15:43,520
Who said it wasn't?

338
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:44,640
It's really strange today.

339
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:45,520
Wait a minute.

340
00:15:45,960 --> 00:15:46,560
What's wrong?

341
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:49,480
Something is wrong.

342
00:15:50,520 --> 00:15:52,120
Three consecutive cases

343
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:54,160
were all deceived by the police

344
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:55,520
and the same amount of money.

345
00:15:56,240 --> 00:15:57,640
They were all in our country.

346
00:15:57,800 --> 00:15:58,360
Captain An,

347
00:15:58,600 --> 00:15:59,920
you mean...

348
00:16:00,840 --> 00:16:02,400
The amount of money

349
00:16:03,280 --> 00:16:06,000
was all 9999 yuan.

350
00:16:08,840 --> 00:16:09,440
Captain An,

351
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:11,000
I'm the one who's going to be charged with this case.

352
00:16:11,160 --> 00:16:11,920
What do you mean?

353
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:12,960
I didn't do anything that time.

354
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:13,600
Really?

355
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:15,040
You're just a supporter.

356
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:15,920
I'm a supporter.

357
00:16:16,080 --> 00:16:17,000
You're not going to admit it.

358
00:16:17,160 --> 00:16:17,840
He's a loser.

359
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:18,840
You're still going to be a supporter.

360
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:20,240
Sir.

361
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:21,080
What are you looking for?

362
00:16:21,760 --> 00:16:24,520
We just solved a small case of 9999 yuan.

363
00:16:25,080 --> 00:16:26,440
We have to jump to the sky.

364
00:16:26,640 --> 00:16:27,400
Sir,

365
00:16:27,800 --> 00:16:28,840
this is the first case

366
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:29,960
we've solved in such a long time.

367
00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:30,880
It's worth knowing.

368
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:31,520
Yes.

369
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:32,760
It's meaningful.

370
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:35,200
Call Chen Lian back.

371
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:36,160
I'm going to ask him again.

372
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:36,920
Yes.

373
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:38,000
You two come with me.

374
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:42,600
I didn't believe it at first.

375
00:16:42,760 --> 00:16:44,240
But he sent me a link.

376
00:16:44,400 --> 00:16:45,280
I opened it and saw

377
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:47,160
that this is the website of the Bureau of Public Security.

378
00:16:47,320 --> 00:16:47,920
Who...

379
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:49,120
Who isn't afraid of this?

380
00:16:49,280 --> 00:16:50,280
He asked me to download a video call software

381
00:16:50,440 --> 00:16:52,240
on the official website.

382
00:16:52,960 --> 00:16:53,800
I think

383
00:16:53,960 --> 00:16:55,720
there's a fake one on the official website.

384
00:16:55,880 --> 00:16:57,080
What did the other party do to you?

385
00:16:57,240 --> 00:16:58,400
He said that the video interrogation

386
00:16:58,560 --> 00:16:59,440
is also confidential.

387
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:00,680
You have to listen to every word

388
00:17:00,840 --> 00:17:01,480
I say now

389
00:17:01,640 --> 00:17:02,680
and answer it clearly.

390
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:04,760
He interrogated me like a criminal.

391
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,160
He interrogated me for a long time.

392
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:08,240
He said he would detain me

393
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:09,720
and let me investigate further.

394
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:11,920
And then?

395
00:17:12,080 --> 00:17:13,160
He said

396
00:17:13,640 --> 00:17:14,760
he would consider the actual situation.

397
00:17:14,920 --> 00:17:16,360
You can be allowed to take the case.

398
00:17:16,520 --> 00:17:18,440
But you have to ensure that during the investigation,

399
00:17:18,600 --> 00:17:19,440
you won't leave Jianghai

400
00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:20,560
and don't leak the video.

401
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:21,280
Will the video be stored

402
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:22,560
in the phone directly?

403
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:23,480
Of course not.

404
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:24,800
This is a special software.

405
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:26,280
When you are receiving the interrogation,

406
00:17:26,440 --> 00:17:28,120
the phone can't record the voice.

407
00:17:28,280 --> 00:17:29,280
But in the actual operation,

408
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:30,480
someone will use other methods

409
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:31,240
to leak the video.

410
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:32,040
In order to effectively

411
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:32,960
reveal the situation,

412
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:34,480
you need to pay the guarantee.

413
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:35,760
How much do you want to pay?

414
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:37,360
9999 yuan.

415
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:38,360
Why is the guarantee amount

416
00:17:38,520 --> 00:17:39,160
this number?

417
00:17:39,320 --> 00:17:40,640
I guess you have figured it out.

418
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:43,160
Han Chuan, it's really you.

419
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:44,440
Where are you now?

420
00:17:45,080 --> 00:17:46,000
I can't tell you.

421
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:46,960
But I left you

422
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:48,000
another message.

423
00:17:48,280 --> 00:17:49,440
The big oil poem?

424
00:17:49,800 --> 00:17:50,480
Yes.

425
00:17:55,560 --> 00:17:57,360
The power of power is like a snake

426
00:17:58,040 --> 00:17:59,760
who is greedy for the world.

427
00:17:59,960 --> 00:18:01,520
The evil is a crime.

428
00:18:01,720 --> 00:18:03,360
The heart is as high as the sky.

429
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:04,840
The evil name of the five horses is stinky.

430
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:06,480
The soul that is chained is czar's spirit.

431
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:07,920
Really as encourage thisLNeo Is the Viper.

432
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:26,180
The

433
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:32,760
Predecessor

434
00:19:04,840 --> 00:19:07,840
I'm afraid that I can't be with you.

435
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:10,840
I'm afraid that I can't be with you.

436
00:19:10,840 --> 00:19:13,840
I'm afraid that I can't be with you.

437
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:16,840
I'm afraid that I can't be with you.

438
00:19:16,840 --> 00:19:19,840
I'm afraid that I can't be with you.

439
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:22,840
I'm afraid that I can't be with you.

440
00:19:22,840 --> 00:19:25,840
I'm afraid that I can't be with you.

441
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:28,840
I'm afraid that I can't be with you.

442
00:19:28,840 --> 00:19:31,840
I'm afraid that I can't be with you.

443
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:34,840
I'm afraid that I can't be with you.

444
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:37,840
I'm afraid that I can't be with you.

445
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:40,840
I'm afraid that I can't be with you.

446
00:19:40,840 --> 00:19:43,840
I'm afraid that I can't be with you.

447
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:46,840
I'm afraid that I can't be with you.

448
00:19:46,840 --> 00:19:49,840
I'm afraid that I can't be with you.

449
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:52,840
I'm afraid that I can't be with you.

450
00:19:52,840 --> 00:19:55,840
I'm afraid that I can't be with you.

451
00:19:55,840 --> 00:19:58,840
I'm afraid that I can't be with you.
