1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
The King of Blaze

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Episode 16

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:13,000
The King of Blaze

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:15,500
A small area

5
00:00:15,500 --> 00:00:18,000
is stronger than the police station's armed forces.

6
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:20,500
Of course.

7
00:00:20,500 --> 00:00:21,500
Here,

8
00:00:21,500 --> 00:00:24,000
money can make people buy lives,

9
00:00:24,500 --> 00:00:26,000
and even more so, people can sell them.

10
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,000
So,

11
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
we need to work harder

12
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
on this plan.

13
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Don't worry.

14
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:38,000
I'm here,

15
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
and none of them can escape.

16
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Han Chuan,

17
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
you've been on the island.

18
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Did Chief Sang say that?

19
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Chief Sang grew up in the East China Sea.

20
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
He knows better than me.

21
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,000
Wei,

22
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
don't worry.

23
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
I'll study the new justice plan

24
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,000
with Chief Sang again.

25
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,000
It seems that

26
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Chief Sang and my colleague are familiar.

27
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Of course.

28
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
We're like old friends.

29
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,000
I want to keep him as a policeman in the East.

30
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,000
It's unlikely that he'll stay.

31
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
After this operation,

32
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
if we have a chance,

33
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,000
can Chief Sang

34
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
come back to China with us?

35
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,000
Sure.

36
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
I haven't been back to China for a long time.

37
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
I'll be there if I have a chance.

38
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,000
How about

39
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,000
we do it today?

40
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,000
I have a meeting later.

41
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Okay.

42
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,000
By the way,

43
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
where do you live now?

44
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,000
I heard that

45
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
you don't live

46
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
in the hotel arranged by our police station.

47
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
We've settled down.

48
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
I won't bother you.

49
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Okay.

50
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Let's do it today.

51
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
I hope our plan goes well.

52
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,000
I believe

53
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
with Chief Sang's help,

54
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,000
we can completely

55
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:12,080
get rid of the

56
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:16,000
We've bought one on the way.

57
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Do you like it?

58
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Where did you buy it?

59
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Near the police station.

60
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
I bought it from a girl.

61
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,000
She said

62
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
this jade could keep me safe.

63
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Xiao Xiao

64
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
asked me to buy this jade

65
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
in the dark.

66
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
That means she's safe now.

67
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,000
How is it?

68
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Thanks.

69
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,000
You're welcome.

70
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
I'm not a thief.

71
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
I'm just a policeman.

72
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
I'm just a policeman.

73
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
I'm just a policeman.

74
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
I'm just a policeman.

75
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
I'm just a policeman.

76
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
You're welcome.

77
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Chief Sang,

78
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
we're leaving.

79
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Brother,

80
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
I'll show you a good show.

81
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Chief Sang,

82
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
are you satisfied?

83
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
I won't leave with An Fei.

84
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Brother,

85
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
you did a good job.

86
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
But you want me to believe you.

87
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
That's not enough.

88
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
What do you want?

89
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Look at An Fei's car.

90
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
I prepared a surprise for him.

91
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
As long as you press this button,

92
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
it will start.

93
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:06,140
This is the

94
00:04:06,140 --> 00:04:07,000
you want to teach Tong Mingzhu.

95
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Chief Sang,

96
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
you've gone too far.

97
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
How did I go too far?

98
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
It's just a choice.

99
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Either choose my trust,

100
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
or choose your good brother's life.

101
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
It's up to you.

102
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
You have a dozen seconds to think.

103
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
An Fei!

104
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
An Fei!

105
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Xiao Jian.

106
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,000
Now.

107
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Press it.

108
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Press it!

109
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
This is my good brother.

110
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Brother,

111
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Xu Budi said

112
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:17,000
I was so lucky this year.

113
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
I couldn't stop him.

114
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Brother,

115
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
as long as you say

116
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
I'm the best in the world,

117
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
I'll listen to you.

118
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
This is my sincere words.

119
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Brother,

120
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
do you know?

121
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
My father is a talkative person.

122
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
He only makes money,

123
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
but he can't save money.

124
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,000
In the end,

125
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
we're both talented.

126
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
But I'm different.

127
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:08,000
I'm a free-spirited person.

128
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
I have the right

129
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
to use my wealth

130
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:19,000
to protect my rights.

131
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
So I have the right

132
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
to expand my wealth.

133
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Brother, listen to me.

134
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
We'll be the kings of the East.

135
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
The whole East will be ours.

136
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,000
I'm sorry.

137
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
I'm sorry.

138
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
I'm sorry.

139
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
I'm sorry.

140
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
He's a thief.

141
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
They all bullied me.

142
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,000
Brother,

143
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
let me introduce you.

144
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,000
He?

145
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:26,000
He was the one who bullied me.

146
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,000
Later,

147
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
I learned to use my wealth

148
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
to protect my rights.

149
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,000
With money,

150
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
I won't be bullied.

151
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,000
With money,

152
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:02,000
I can protect the people I care about.

153
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,000
Brother,

154
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
with wisdom,

155
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,000
with ability,

156
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,000
with destiny,

157
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,000
we can conquer

158
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
the wider world.

159
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,000
Isn't that good?

160
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
The East, the South,

161
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
China, Asia,

162
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
the whole world.

163
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
I'm not interested in that.

164
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
Why are you talking nonsense?

165
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
How many men are there?

166
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,000
How many men

167
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
have dreams for the rest of their lives?

168
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
Song Duo, let me tell you.

169
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
I only want to see Xiao Xiao now.

170
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,000
It's simple.

171
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
Answer.

172
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
My brother said he wanted to see his sister.

173
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,000
Are you a dragon?

174
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,000
Or are you like Uncle Biao?

175
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
Your tongue is cut off.

176
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
Go and bring Han Xiao Xiao here.

177
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,000
Last night,

178
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
something happened.

179
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,000
Li Bai Ling died.

180
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,000
Han Xiao Xiao

181
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,000
ran away.

182
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
I know.

183
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,000
Go and do your own thing.

184
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,000
I'll go.

185
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,000
What does it mean?

186
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
What's wrong with Xiao Xiao?

187
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,000
Brother,

188
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
Xiao Xiao is in a safe room now.

189
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
She can't get a single leaf on her.

190
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,000
Where is she?

191
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
I want to see her.

192
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,000
I'll let you see her.

193
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,000
But not now.

194
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
Why?

195
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,000
Brother,

196
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,000
think about it.

197
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,000
Tie Fu's forces

198
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,000
are still not clear.

199
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
There are many eyes

200
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,000
watching us.

201
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,000
You go and see her now.

202
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,000
You can't

203
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
put her in a dangerous situation.

204
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,000
Brother,

205
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
see her

206
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,000
or not,

207
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
you choose.

208
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,000
Zi Sang Tong,

209
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
I'll trust you one last time.

210
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,000
I'm tired.

211
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,000
How long do you think you can last?

212
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,000
Let's go.

213
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,000
No matter what,

214
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,000
we will take her away.

215
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,000
I have money too.

216
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
I have money, I have power.

217
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,720
I won't die if I try these.

218
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:08,320
Hurry.

219
00:12:10,680 --> 00:12:13,080
Don't follow me!

220
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:37,340
Except for you, let's kill that bastard once and for all

221
00:12:45,540 --> 00:12:47,640
He's然后他

222
00:12:48,340 --> 00:12:50,840
We're talking about break-in

223
00:12:50,840 --> 00:12:53,580
Don't get me wrong

224
00:12:53,580 --> 00:12:55,040
in terms oflegal

225
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:57,040
Big brother

226
00:12:57,040 --> 00:13:02,100
ask the prefect

227
00:13:02,100 --> 00:13:05,100
An Fei would never give me a stone for no reason.

228
00:13:06,100 --> 00:13:08,100
There must be a clue.

229
00:13:09,100 --> 00:13:11,100
Okay. You wait here.

230
00:13:22,100 --> 00:13:23,100
Where is Captain An?

231
00:13:23,100 --> 00:13:24,100
I'll go in and check.

232
00:13:24,100 --> 00:13:25,100
Xiao Xiao, you can't go in.

233
00:13:25,100 --> 00:13:26,100
Captain An is at work.

234
00:13:26,100 --> 00:13:27,100
Don't lie to me.

235
00:13:27,100 --> 00:13:28,100
I know something happened to him.

236
00:13:28,100 --> 00:13:29,100
I'll go in and check.

237
00:13:29,100 --> 00:13:30,100
Go in.

238
00:13:33,100 --> 00:13:36,100
Captain An has been arrested.

239
00:13:36,100 --> 00:13:37,100
He's accused of corruption.

240
00:13:38,100 --> 00:13:40,100
His wife has been looking for him several times.

241
00:13:40,100 --> 00:13:41,100
But since the day before yesterday,

242
00:13:41,100 --> 00:13:43,100
his wife hasn't left the house again.

243
00:13:43,100 --> 00:13:45,100
I suspect that he's in danger.

244
00:13:46,100 --> 00:13:47,100
Yes, Master.

245
00:13:47,100 --> 00:13:48,100
I'm going to look for him this afternoon.

246
00:13:49,100 --> 00:13:51,100
He's the only one who can help us now.

247
00:13:51,100 --> 00:13:52,100
I understand, Master.

248
00:13:52,100 --> 00:13:53,100
Don't worry.

249
00:13:54,100 --> 00:13:56,100
I'll bring Han Chuan and Xiao Xiao back safely.

250
00:13:57,100 --> 00:13:58,100
Yes.

251
00:14:03,100 --> 00:14:04,100
Captain An,

252
00:14:05,100 --> 00:14:07,100
didn't you get hit by a car bomb?

253
00:14:07,100 --> 00:14:08,100
He's in danger.

254
00:14:08,100 --> 00:14:09,100
He was badly injured.

255
00:14:21,100 --> 00:14:22,100
An Fei!

256
00:14:22,100 --> 00:14:23,100
An Fei!

257
00:14:30,100 --> 00:14:31,100
An Fei,

258
00:14:31,100 --> 00:14:34,100
you must see the remote control device in my hand.

259
00:14:35,100 --> 00:14:37,100
I'll kill the enemy three times later.

260
00:14:37,100 --> 00:14:39,100
After the third time,

261
00:14:39,100 --> 00:14:40,100
you'll be the one to report.

262
00:14:48,100 --> 00:14:49,100
Come here.

263
00:14:50,100 --> 00:14:51,100
We've been hit by a bomb.

264
00:14:51,100 --> 00:14:52,100
Okay.

265
00:14:52,100 --> 00:14:53,100
Don't be nervous.

266
00:14:53,100 --> 00:14:54,100
It's about Han Chuan's life.

267
00:14:54,100 --> 00:15:07,540
Don't let Sang Tuo see the

268
00:15:19,100 --> 00:15:21,100
bomb.

269
00:15:50,100 --> 00:15:51,100
I'm sorry.

270
00:15:51,100 --> 00:15:52,100
