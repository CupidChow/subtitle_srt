1
00:00:00,820 --> 00:00:05,940
Log Cabinet

2
00:00:10,680 --> 00:00:13,440
Episode 6

3
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:14,820
Of course you two should have settled the case

4
00:00:15,160 --> 00:00:15,660
Have some more time

5
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:23,860
The money is transferred

6
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:25,100
Continue the 2011 joint business

7
00:00:26,300 --> 00:00:27,500
I'll surrender

8
00:00:27,500 --> 00:00:28,140
Oh no

9
00:00:33,560 --> 00:00:34,560
Then three years have passed

10
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:35,080
доп me

11
00:00:35,560 --> 00:00:36,060
What?

12
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:37,240
Slowly

13
00:00:39,640 --> 00:00:40,360
Don't worry

14
00:00:40,360 --> 00:00:43,360
The money has been transferred. Continue to clear.

15
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:55,760
They have transferred the money from the first-level card.

16
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:57,560
Check to 61 cards and 2-level cards.

17
00:00:57,560 --> 00:00:58,560
I have already transferred the card number to you.

18
00:00:58,560 --> 00:00:59,960
There are 192 cards in the 3-level card.

19
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:02,160
I have checked 80 cards.

20
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:03,960
Master, you're still not stopping them?

21
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:05,160
Wait a bit longer.

22
00:01:05,160 --> 00:01:09,160
I will get all the cards that they have previously transferred.

23
00:01:10,360 --> 00:01:11,560
Okay.

24
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:21,960
Okay.

25
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:22,960
Let the car driver start.

26
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:24,360
Yes.

27
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:33,560
Wu Xun, there are no new cards.

28
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:42,960
Wu Xun, there are no new cards.

29
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:45,560
I will get all the cards that they have previously transferred.

30
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:47,360
Okay.

31
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:48,960
Okay.

32
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:51,160
Okay.

33
00:01:51,160 --> 00:01:53,360
Okay.

34
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:55,160
Okay.

35
00:01:55,160 --> 00:01:57,360
Okay.

36
00:01:57,360 --> 00:01:59,160
Okay.

37
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:00,960
Okay.

38
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:02,960
Okay.

39
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:05,160
Okay.

40
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:07,160
Okay.

41
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:09,360
Okay.

42
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:11,960
Okay.

43
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:19,760
Wu Xun, the blocking is successful.

44
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:22,160
Did you get the information?

45
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:31,760
Wu Xun, you are scaring me.

46
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:34,560
Director Wang, thank you for your cooperation.

47
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:36,560
You're welcome.

48
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:38,560
Please be kind to us.

49
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:40,160
Master.

50
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:45,560
There are a total of 333 cards.

51
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:49,160
The other ones were used to block the money from being used for the virtual currency.

52
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:52,960
They only transferred the 3-level card.

53
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:54,960
It means that they are still using the car driver.

54
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:58,360
Since there is a car driver who is taking the money, he will leave a video.

55
00:02:58,360 --> 00:03:00,760
Wei Yang Yang, you two

56
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:02,760
continue digging along the bank card line.

57
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:06,760
Try your best to find out all the information about the car driver and the car owner.

58
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:08,960
See if there are any clues. Check the water source behind them.

59
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:10,560
Yes.

60
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:15,360
Director Wang, do you think Director Wang can understand what we are trying to say?

61
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:22,960
Let Han Chuan cooperate with the gold fraud case?

62
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:24,960
The gold fraud case has been too rampant lately.

63
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:26,360
It has had a huge impact.

64
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:28,760
We have been investigating for a few months and there is no clue.

65
00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:30,760
Now Han Chuan is in the fraud group.

66
00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:33,160
Maybe this is a new breakthrough.

67
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:34,560
What are you doing?

68
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:36,760
I will try to send him a message.

69
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:39,160
I believe he can understand.

70
00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:40,760
He will definitely understand.

71
00:03:40,760 --> 00:03:43,760
I will not be innocent and keep my eyes on the video.

72
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:55,560
Gold followed the water source.

73
00:03:57,960 --> 00:04:01,160
From the various banks to the fraud center to cooperate with the law enforcement,

74
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:04,560
we have increased the barrier rate of fraud.

75
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:08,960
But the frauds have come up with a new type of gold fraud.

76
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:11,560
They can let the victim buy the gold and then cheat the owner.

77
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:15,360
This can avoid network supervision and increase the privacy.

78
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:17,960
But it also increases our difficulty in finding the gold.

79
00:04:17,960 --> 00:04:21,560
The problem we are facing now is that only the frauds

80
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:24,760
can let the victim use a taxi or a flash drive

81
00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:26,960
to send the gold to the location they have set.

82
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:29,560
The people who took the gold are also their temporary customers.

83
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:30,960
So it's hard to find the gold.

84
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:33,760
The most important thing to fight gold fraud

85
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:36,560
is the pure presence of their transaction volume.

86
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:40,360
And the most beneficial thing to us is also this.

87
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:48,560
Who is in charge of the gold fraud in this circle?

88
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:52,160
Uncle Fu, I know the speed of the water room.

89
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:53,960
From the first level to the third level,

90
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:55,360
there is also virtual currency.

91
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:58,360
At most five minutes, it's all gone.

92
00:04:58,360 --> 00:05:01,560
In such a short time, unless the police know it first,

93
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:04,160
otherwise, it's impossible to stop it all.

94
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:06,560
This kind of situation never happened before.

95
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:07,960
How can it be so coincidental?

96
00:05:07,960 --> 00:05:11,760
Something happened at the third level.

97
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:14,760
No, what do you mean?

98
00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:18,760
Uncle Fu, I suspect something is wrong with the third level.

99
00:05:18,760 --> 00:05:21,160
It's connected to the police.

100
00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:26,360
Uncle Fu, Sister Zha, it's nothing.

101
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:27,760
What are you doing?

102
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:29,560
If you have the chance, you have to

103
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:32,760
put the money on my people.

104
00:05:32,760 --> 00:05:35,360
Your people are already in the third level.

105
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:38,360
Do you really think he's willing to be your little brother?

106
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:39,360
What's wrong with you?

107
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:44,360
No matter who's little brother, it's all Uncle Fu's people.

108
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:46,360
What's wrong with you two?

109
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:48,160
Do you want to be the boss yourself?

110
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:49,760
Sister Zha, I didn't mean that.

111
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:51,160
It's nothing.

112
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:52,960
Enough.

113
00:05:53,960 --> 00:05:57,560
This time, it's not about the water room.

114
00:05:57,560 --> 00:05:59,160
It's not about the thirteenth level.

115
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:01,560
If you want to blame it, blame it on the actions of the Chinese police.

116
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:03,160
It's getting faster and faster.

117
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:05,560
It's getting harder to deal with.

118
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:08,960
The water room will also have to be more careful from now on.

119
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:10,560
Uncle Fu, don't worry.

120
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:12,960
I've already tried my new method for three months.

121
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:14,160
I've never failed.

122
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:16,360
It's about 20 million.

123
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:18,560
You can't just let it go like this.

124
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:21,160
No matter what method you use,

125
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:24,360
you must get back at me.

126
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:49,160
How's the investigation going?

127
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:52,760
Brother Dong, I should have found his father.

128
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:02,160
Brother, are we really going to do this?

129
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:06,160
We've never touched the gold business before.

130
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:09,160
We won't just learn.

131
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:11,760
Learn? Who are we learning from?

132
00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:14,160
The area is so big. No one will mess with us.

133
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:16,160
Who?

134
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:17,560
Anyway, as far as I know,

135
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:20,960
Basi, HaiKan, and HeiRuiDong don't have this business.

136
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:22,360
They won't sneak up on us?

137
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:24,560
That's impossible. We can't stop them.

138
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:27,760
Besides, they have their own business. Where's the time?

139
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:31,360
Gao Hong Jin, find Nezha.

140
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:33,160
Nezha is doing this business?

141
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:35,560
I don't know if what I told you is true.

142
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:38,560
The area usually has new business. They will give it to Nezha first.

143
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:41,360
When he's done, they'll give it to Er Lou.

144
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:45,960
And I heard Si YanZai bragging about the gold business.

145
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:47,560
But I didn't take it seriously.

146
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:50,960
You're good, Brother Rui. I didn't see it coming. You know a lot.

147
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:55,160
Think about it. 90% of people in the whole area eat here.

148
00:07:55,160 --> 00:07:58,360
You think he's a market, but he's actually a small intelligence station.

149
00:07:58,360 --> 00:08:01,760
No matter what people say, do, or want to do,

150
00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:04,360
as long as you're attentive, you can find out.

151
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:07,760
Okay, okay. Brother, look at him. He's so capable.

152
00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:10,360
I'm just kidding. I'm a high-class student.

153
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:11,360
I'm in that...

154
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:13,160
I know, I know.

155
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:15,560
DongBang WuYanZuMa.

156
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:16,960
You just need to know.

157
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:18,760
Let's eat.

158
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:26,360
Brother, how about we really ask around?

159
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:33,360
I'll take a bite.

160
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:38,360
Brother, I heard that Black Ghost is investigating your real identity in China.

161
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:40,160
You need to be careful.

162
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:43,560
I know, brother. Thank you.

163
00:08:43,560 --> 00:08:46,960
Actually, I have one more question to ask you.

164
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:48,560
Go ahead.

165
00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:51,960
This time, 20 million people were intercepted by the police.

166
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:53,960
You're really unlucky.

167
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:56,560
You're lucky to have a good life.

168
00:08:56,560 --> 00:08:58,960
You're lucky to have a good life.

169
00:08:58,960 --> 00:09:01,360
You're lucky to have a good life.

170
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:05,960
Are you really unlucky or did you deliberately call me a liar?

171
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:14,560
It's okay, brother. I didn't ask.

172
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:16,360
I didn't ask.

173
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:20,360
AnRui, you're smart.

174
00:09:22,760 --> 00:09:27,160
Brother, even though I still don't understand what you're trying to do,

175
00:09:27,160 --> 00:09:29,560
I think you're different from them.

176
00:09:29,560 --> 00:09:33,560
If you need anything in the future, just tell me.

177
00:09:35,560 --> 00:09:37,160
Let's eat.

178
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:38,760
Let's eat.

179
00:09:59,560 --> 00:10:01,360
Let's eat.

180
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:26,160
Xiaoxiao, stop taking medicine.

181
00:10:29,560 --> 00:10:31,760
Your foot is too infected.

182
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:33,960
If you don't take the medicine, you won't be able to...

183
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:38,160
Stop pretending to be a star, okay?

184
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:53,960
The doctor said that if I don't take the medicine,

185
00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:58,960
I'll become a disabled person.

186
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:02,760
You're the one who caused me to be like this.

187
00:11:03,560 --> 00:11:06,160
What are you doing now?

188
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:08,760
Are you pretending to be a good person?

189
00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:10,960
No, no, Xiaoxiao.

190
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:14,360
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to. They forced me to scold me. If I don't take the medicine...

191
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:16,760
Then you deserve it.

192
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:24,960
I deserve it?

193
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:27,760
Yes, you deserve it.

194
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:31,960
Yes.

195
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:34,160
I deserve it.

196
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:39,160
I deserve to be here. I deserve to be beaten. I deserve to be treated like a bastard!

197
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:42,560
You think I'm doing well, right?

198
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:46,760
Ever since I came here, I've never been beaten.

199
00:11:46,760 --> 00:11:50,560
These wounds are all because I was forced to take the medicine on the sixth floor.

200
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:52,960
I made money and begged for money. What did they do?

201
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:55,360
They beat me, beat me, and abused me.

202
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:58,160
They didn't even treat me well.

203
00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:01,960
They didn't even treat me as a human being.

204
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:04,160
I...

205
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:07,960
I am the tool they used to bully me.

206
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:09,360
Do you think I want to be like this?

207
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:11,960
I want to live. I don't have a good brother who's trying to kill me.

208
00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:15,360
I want to live. Tell me, am I wrong?

209
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:18,960
Tell me.

210
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:22,560
Do I want to live? Am I wrong?

211
00:12:29,160 --> 00:12:30,760
I...

212
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:35,160
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

213
00:12:35,160 --> 00:12:37,760
I shouldn't have said that.

214
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:40,160
I...

215
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:43,160
I... I...

216
00:12:43,160 --> 00:12:48,760
I actually regret coming here. I regret bringing you into this hell.

217
00:12:48,760 --> 00:12:50,760
Xiao Qiao, beat me.

218
00:12:50,760 --> 00:12:53,160
Beat me!

219
00:12:59,160 --> 00:13:03,160
I don't know why I'm like this.

220
00:13:03,160 --> 00:13:05,360
I'm sorry.

221
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:07,360
I'm sorry.

222
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:10,360
I'm sorry.

223
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:17,760
I'm sorry.

224
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:32,160
What's wrong?

225
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:35,560
The light fades in the night

226
00:13:35,560 --> 00:13:38,960
The fireflies are shining

227
00:13:38,960 --> 00:13:46,160
The light is all over the city

228
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:50,760
I'm with you in the storm

229
00:13:50,760 --> 00:13:53,160
Think about it.

230
00:13:53,160 --> 00:13:55,360
I owe you this.

231
00:13:56,360 --> 00:13:58,960
Believe me one more time.

232
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:05,160
Even if I have to risk my life, I will be with you.

233
00:14:05,160 --> 00:14:07,360
I'll take you with me.

234
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:12,560
The light is all over the city

235
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:16,760
The fireflies are shining

236
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:28,560
I'm with you in the storm

237
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:31,360
Think about it.

238
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:33,760
I owe you this.

239
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:36,160
I owe you this.

240
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:39,360
I owe you this.

241
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:42,360
I'm with you in the storm

242
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:44,960
The fireflies are shining

243
00:14:44,960 --> 00:14:47,760
I owe you this.

244
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:50,360
Gotta make a decision.

245
00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:53,160
I'm with you in the storm

246
00:14:53,160 --> 00:14:54,360
Let him in.

247
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:55,360
Okay.

248
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:10,760
Sister Zha.

249
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:19,160
Brother Hao, you're here.

250
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:20,760
Sister Zha.

251
00:15:23,560 --> 00:15:25,560
I asked Li Bailing to take care of your sister.

252
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:27,760
They're classmates.

253
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:29,560
Don't worry.

254
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:31,560
Thank you, Sister Zha.

255
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:33,960
But besides seeing Xiaoxiao,

256
00:15:34,360 --> 00:15:36,360
I have one more thing to ask of you.

257
00:15:37,560 --> 00:15:38,560
Ask me?

258
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:48,960
Brother C3.

259
00:15:49,560 --> 00:15:50,360
Thank you.

260
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:55,560
I'll go out after I finish.

261
00:15:56,560 --> 00:15:57,560
Okay.

262
00:16:03,560 --> 00:16:06,560
My back hurts lately.

263
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:14,360
Sister Zha.

264
00:16:14,760 --> 00:16:16,560
I just learned how to massage.

265
00:16:17,160 --> 00:16:18,560
If you don't mind...

266
00:16:23,760 --> 00:16:24,760
Come on.

267
00:16:43,960 --> 00:16:44,960
Sister Zha.

268
00:16:45,760 --> 00:16:47,160
Is this massage okay?

269
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:49,560
Use more strength.

270
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:55,160
Okay.

271
00:17:00,760 --> 00:17:01,760
Sister Zha.

272
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:04,560
What we know about the medical conditions on the island

273
00:17:05,360 --> 00:17:07,160
is that Xiaoxiao is badly injured.

274
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:10,360
I want to send her to the east gang.

275
00:17:23,660 --> 00:17:26,060
It really hurts.

276
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:27,560
Don't cry.

277
00:17:27,560 --> 00:17:31,920
rein into the heart

278
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,960
term fired

279
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:52,840
Silver starry sky

280
00:17:52,840 --> 00:17:56,000
Sp campoloud

281
00:17:56,000 --> 00:18:03,000
The dark clouds rise in the window

282
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:09,000
The light in my fingertips melts the cold winter

283
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:16,000
In my palm, my heart holds the fire

284
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:23,000
In the fog, the unidentified boat

285
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:29,000
I know where to go and where to go

286
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:36,000
The light scatters, the night color glows

287
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:43,000
The light travels around the world

288
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:50,000
The clouds are in the wind, the waves are in the wind

289
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:57,000
The waves are floating in the dust

290
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:04,000
The waves are in the ice, the waves are in the whirlpool

291
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:14,000
The dawn has never fallen
