00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
The Taoism Grandmaster

00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Episode 16

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Taoism Grandmaster

4
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Uncle Feng, isn't it too easy to kill him?

5
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,000
I think we should sell him to Lin Shou.

6
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Shoot him as soon as you get down.

7
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Hurry up and lock him up.

8
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Take down the Taoist Temple first.

9
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Shoot him.

10
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Hurry up.

11
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Hurry up.

12
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,000
Don't be late.

13
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Taoist.

14
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Taoist.

15
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Brother,

16
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,000
I was right.

17
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
I knew you would come to save me.

18
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
You little bastard.

19
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,000
You bastard.

20
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,000
You bastard.

21
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,000
You bastard.

22
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Watch him.

23
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
You bastard.

24
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,000
You bastard.

25
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Come on.

26
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Come on.

27
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Brother.

28
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Brother.

29
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Brother.

30
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Brother.

31
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Let go of me.

32
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Brother,

33
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
take a rest first.

34
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
We'll catch up later.

35
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Brother, what do you mean?

36
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Let me introduce myself.

37
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
My name is Sang Tu.

38
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
My father is a monk.

39
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,000
How did Boss Suo die?

40
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000
He was alive.

41
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Two years ago, Uncle Feng killed his whole family.

42
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
He still didn't become a boss.

43
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Let me tell you.

44
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Actually,

45
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
he didn't even close the door.

46
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
The boss even ran away with a illegitimate child.

47
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Sang Tu,

48
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
I did everything for the sake of the Yuan family.

49
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Second Master,

50
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
I didn't know you before.

51
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
I know that I can still live until now.

52
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Lan Bei Fen,

53
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
you are my nephew.

54
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
I am your uncle.

55
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:38,000
We can work together to destroy this Yuan family.

56
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
When you destroyed my family,

57
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
when you chased after me,

58
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:48,000
why didn't you treat me as your nephew?

59
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
You...

60
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
You burned me.

61
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
I don't want anything.

62
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
I'll give you everything, okay?

63
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Why don't you have a bone?

64
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:14,000
How could you kill my whole family?

65
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Is there a bad person in your bone?

66
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
First Master,

67
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
I was wrong.

68
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,000
I was wrong.

69
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:28,000
If you choose to kill me today,

70
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:31,000
instead of choosing to go to the tomb,

71
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:34,000
you might not have the same result.

72
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,000
By the way,

73
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
next time you meet with any trouble,

74
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
I'll teach you how to do it.

75
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Wait for me.

76
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
I'll teach you how to do it.

77
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
What should I do?

78
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Wait for me.

79
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Okay.

80
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Third Brother!

81
00:05:55,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Third Brother!

82
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Third Brother!

83
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Third Brother,

84
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,000
to you.

85
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
You're still in charge of the technical team.

86
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,000
Thank you, Third Brother.

87
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Thank you, Brother Xiao.

88
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Thanks, Brother Xiao.

89
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
Give me a hand.

90
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Give it to me.

91
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Brother.

92
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,000
Do you know

93
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,000
I'm so happy

94
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,240
So you wanted to get back to the original place

95
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:19,480
You were using me before

96
00:07:19,880 --> 00:07:22,160
How can I call it using, brother?

97
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:26,000
You promised me to revenge for me

98
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:28,920
Actually I don't like to kill people at all

99
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:32,280
The people who died today

100
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:36,360
are the killers who killed my parents

101
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:38,560
Let me tell you

102
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:42,960
This place belongs to me

103
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:47,080
Tie Fu is just a dog who sold his life for our family

104
00:07:48,280 --> 00:07:51,800
We fed him and fed him

105
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:54,160
But I didn't expect

106
00:07:54,840 --> 00:07:59,520
this dog would kill its master

107
00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:03,040
Just for that money

108
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:05,520
I lost my family

109
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:09,200
So I want to revenge

110
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:12,640
I want to get back everything that belongs to me

111
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,080
My uncle

112
00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:23,520
For the trust of Tie Fu

113
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:29,680
he cut his tongue off

114
00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:32,280
for this day

115
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:34,720
You say

116
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:38,120
I deserve to die

117
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:41,760
You deserve to die

118
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:49,320
Non integrating

119
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:51,880
Die

120
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:58,400
I want to revenge

121
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:01,680
I am a illegitimate child.

122
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:06,680
My birth mother died.

123
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:10,680
My stepmother kicked me out of the house.

124
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:15,680
She kicked me into that orphanage where my father was raised.

125
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:19,680
She didn't allow me to take over the business of Yuan Qu.

126
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:22,680
That's why Tie Fu didn't recognize me.

127
00:09:22,680 --> 00:09:27,680
That's why I had the chance to disguise myself as a pig and get into Yuan Qu.

128
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:31,680
That's why I had the chance to meet my brothers.

129
00:09:32,680 --> 00:09:33,680
Big Brother!

130
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:34,680
Big Brother!

131
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:44,680
Brother, all this way,

132
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:48,680
you are the one I want to be grateful to the most.

133
00:09:48,680 --> 00:09:50,680
If it wasn't for you,

134
00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:55,680
I would have been killed by someone.

135
00:09:58,680 --> 00:10:03,680
Or I wouldn't have come to this day alone on this island.

136
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:08,680
Everyone,

137
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:10,680
bow to my brother!

138
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:12,680
Bow to Brother!

139
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:15,680
Brother,

140
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:16,680
since you are back,

141
00:10:16,680 --> 00:10:19,680
stop holding the police pole.

142
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:20,680
What's going on?

143
00:10:20,680 --> 00:10:21,680
What's going on?

144
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:23,680
Why is he in the orphanage?

145
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:41,680
You knew my identity long ago.

146
00:10:44,680 --> 00:10:46,680
You knew my identity long ago.

147
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:47,680
What's going on?

148
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:53,680
The next day we left the city,

149
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:55,680
we found your bag.

150
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:57,680
Everything inside is good.

151
00:10:57,680 --> 00:10:59,680
Do you want to see it?

152
00:11:00,680 --> 00:11:02,680
Then why didn't you tell me?

153
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:05,680
Why should I tell you, Brother?

154
00:11:06,680 --> 00:11:08,680
You were helping me.

155
00:11:08,680 --> 00:11:12,680
I wanted to see how you could get rid of those bastards.

156
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:16,680
From the lucky numbers of four nines,

157
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:20,680
to the hiding places of the angry customers,

158
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:23,680
to the ranking of the heaven and the earth,

159
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:26,680
I was curious.

160
00:11:26,680 --> 00:11:29,680
They never questioned your identity,

161
00:11:30,680 --> 00:11:34,680
nor did they question why your customers

162
00:11:34,680 --> 00:11:36,680
were all from Jianghai.

163
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:40,680
Brother,

164
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:46,680
I know you want to destroy them step by step.

165
00:11:46,680 --> 00:11:48,680
You are helping me.

166
00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:53,680
Everyone,

167
00:11:54,680 --> 00:11:56,680
give a round of applause to Brother 13,

168
00:11:56,680 --> 00:12:01,680
or to the Chinese police Han Chuan.

169
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:02,680
Applause!

170
00:12:10,680 --> 00:12:13,680
Brother, since you are back,

171
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:15,680
let me tell you something.

172
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:18,680
Do you want to continue working with me?

173
00:12:20,680 --> 00:12:23,680
Do you want to take photos with me?

174
00:12:26,680 --> 00:12:27,680
What do you think?

175
00:12:30,680 --> 00:12:33,680
But you don't have the right to choose.

176
00:12:34,680 --> 00:12:36,680
This is my home.

177
00:12:36,680 --> 00:12:38,680
Do you think you can

178
00:12:38,680 --> 00:12:42,680
accommodate a policeman in your home?

179
00:12:42,680 --> 00:12:47,680
We can't!

180
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:49,680
If you can't,

181
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:52,680
what should you do?

182
00:12:52,680 --> 00:12:57,680
Kill them!

183
00:13:00,680 --> 00:13:01,680
Brother,

184
00:13:02,680 --> 00:13:04,680
I'll give you one last chance.

185
00:13:06,680 --> 00:13:07,680
Will you?

186
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:10,680
Please.

187
00:13:12,680 --> 00:13:14,680
Think about it before you answer.

188
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:17,680
I'll really shoot.

189
00:13:24,680 --> 00:13:25,680
I don't want to.

190
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:33,680
Kill them!

191
00:13:38,680 --> 00:13:39,680
Brother!

192
00:13:57,680 --> 00:13:58,680
Brother,

193
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:01,680
they shouted.

194
00:14:02,680 --> 00:14:05,680
How could I kill you?

195
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:07,680
You saved my life.

196
00:14:08,680 --> 00:14:11,680
From the first day I called you brother,

197
00:14:12,680 --> 00:14:14,680
you've always been my brother.

198
00:14:18,680 --> 00:14:20,680
In my home,

199
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:24,680
no matter what you used to do,

200
00:14:26,680 --> 00:14:29,680
be a policeman or a leather-cutter,

201
00:14:30,680 --> 00:14:34,680
it's all the same here.

202
00:14:34,680 --> 00:14:37,680
I only have one goal.

203
00:14:38,680 --> 00:14:41,680
It's to make more money for everyone.

204
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:42,680
Tell brother!

205
00:14:42,680 --> 00:14:44,680
Brother!

206
00:14:44,680 --> 00:14:46,680
Brother!

207
00:14:48,680 --> 00:14:49,680
Brother is here.

208
00:14:50,680 --> 00:14:51,680
Call brother!

209
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:56,680
Brother!

210
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:00,680
I believe

211
00:15:00,680 --> 00:15:03,680
our Chinese police, Han Chuan,

212
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:06,680
will soon be part of our family.

213
00:15:06,680 --> 00:15:07,680
Everyone,

214
00:15:08,680 --> 00:15:09,680
call brother!

215
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:12,680
Call brother!

216
00:15:36,680 --> 00:15:40,680
The Starry Sky

217
00:15:52,680 --> 00:15:55,680
The silver starry sky

218
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:58,680
is like a dream

219
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:03,680
It's divided into two windows

220
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:05,680
It's dark and dark

221
00:16:06,680 --> 00:16:09,680
The fingertips are light

222
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:12,680
The melting of flowers

223
00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:14,680
In my palm,

224
00:16:14,680 --> 00:16:18,680
I hold the candle

225
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:22,680
In the mist,

226
00:16:22,680 --> 00:16:26,680
the nameless bell

227
00:16:26,680 --> 00:16:32,680
I understand where to go and where to go

228
00:16:32,680 --> 00:16:35,680
The light scatters in the night

229
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:38,680
The fireflies are shining

230
00:16:38,680 --> 00:16:45,680
The light is all around

231
00:16:46,680 --> 00:16:52,680
I'm locked in the storm with you

232
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:59,680
I'm floating in the dust

233
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:02,680
In the wave,

234
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:06,680
in the whirlpool

235
00:17:06,680 --> 00:17:16,680
The dawn never falls
