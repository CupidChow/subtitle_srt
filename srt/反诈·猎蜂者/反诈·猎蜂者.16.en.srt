The Taoism Grandmaster

00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Episode 18

3
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:27,800
What's wrong, Shisan?

4
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:28,800
What?

5
00:00:29,200 --> 00:00:30,800
You're dressed like this?

6
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,400
I'm telling you, the place is

7
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,800
where the tree speaks.

8
00:00:37,400 --> 00:00:39,200
If you don't go out,

9
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:43,000
I'll send you and your sister to the forest.

10
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Listen.

11
00:00:45,400 --> 00:00:46,600
Do you hear me?

12
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,400
Brother Hai is talking to you.

13
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:51,600
You're deaf.

14
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:57,200
Where's your brother?

15
00:00:58,400 --> 00:00:59,800
You're talking to each other.

16
00:00:59,800 --> 00:01:00,800
What's wrong?

17
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:02,800
You're not in charge now?

18
00:01:04,600 --> 00:01:06,200
Why should I find you a job?

19
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:09,200
Get up.

20
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:10,400
See how many bottles of water there are?

21
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:11,400
Move them away.

22
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:33,800
The Taoism Grandmaster

23
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:38,800
Taoism Grandmaster

24
00:01:57,600 --> 00:01:58,600
Shisan.

25
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:00,600
Shisan.

26
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:05,400
Sister Zha asked you to go to her tonight.

27
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:16,400
I've done what I promised you.

28
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:19,600
When will you keep your promise?

29
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:23,800
Sister Zha.

30
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:26,200
I'll keep my promise.

31
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:28,200
But now is not the time.

32
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,800
I'm worried about my sister.

33
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,200
I don't want to talk about your sister today.

34
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:38,600
I just want

35
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:41,200
your promise to me.

36
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Sister Zha.

37
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:47,400
I'll go.

38
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:50,400
What?

39
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:52,400
I'll go to sister Zha

40
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:54,800
to find someone to take care of my sister.

41
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:00,600
I'll go.

42
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,000
I'll go.

43
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:13,600
Do you know

44
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:15,600
how much it costs

45
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:19,600
to be the Grandmaster?

46
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:23,600
I don't like that man at all.

47
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:26,600
I like you being so lazy.

48
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:31,600
I like you a lot.

49
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:44,400
Taoism Grandmaster

50
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:49,200
For you,

51
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:51,600
for nothing is hard for me.

52
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:53,200
But why

53
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,200
are you frame-bearing

54
00:03:56,200 --> 00:03:57,200
Only Yin Yin can come.

55
00:03:57,840 --> 00:03:59,080
Only Yin Yin can come.

56
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:03,720
Chen can come!

57
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:08,720
What does Chenguin mean?

58
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:10,800
Are you really stupid

59
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:12,720
or are you a moron?

60
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:17,040
You were supposed to be the team leader.

61
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:22,760
I was just giving you a chance

62
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:25,240
to make yourself admit your mistake.

63
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:27,740
Let's hide first.

64
00:04:42,260 --> 00:04:43,340
It is late.

65
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:44,580
What's up?

66
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:48,400
It is late.

67
00:04:48,420 --> 00:04:50,000
I can't come want you, right?

68
00:04:50,820 --> 00:04:51,360
Is there something wrong?

69
00:04:51,460 --> 00:04:52,840
Let me go in and talk,Sp anda benchmark.

70
00:04:52,860 --> 00:04:53,040
Let's go.

71
00:04:56,200 --> 00:04:57,820
Where is so?

72
00:04:57,820 --> 00:04:59,520
Did someone throw the tea in there?

73
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:00,800
Throw it away.

74
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:02,480
Good.

75
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:04,280
Move.

76
00:05:04,380 --> 00:05:06,800
Move.

77
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:08,280
Move.

78
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:10,160
Move.

79
00:05:10,780 --> 00:05:12,440
Move.

80
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:17,940
Go.

81
00:05:17,940 --> 00:05:20,480
Pass the water to me quickly.

82
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:23,920
Go in.

83
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:25,720
Are you Marshmello or Superman?

84
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:27,760
You can talk to me if you need me

85
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:29,240
I'm busy

86
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:34,120
What did Tie Fu think?

87
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:35,760
He asked Sang Tuo to be the leader

88
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:38,720
If he chooses Shisan, I'll admit it

89
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,760
What is Sang Tuo?

90
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:42,920
Who?

91
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:45,600
But I heard that

92
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:47,360
you can't deal with Sang Tuo

93
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:49,240
so you just used Shisan to vent your anger

94
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,320
I'm not scolding Sang Tuo

95
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:54,360
I'm doing this for Tie Fu's sake

96
00:05:54,840 --> 00:05:56,240
He doesn't care about Shisan

97
00:05:56,760 --> 00:05:58,000
I'm just bullying his brother

98
00:05:58,080 --> 00:05:58,840
venting my anger

99
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:00,640
I'm just hitting him

100
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:04,160
I don't know what Uncle Buddha thinks

101
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:06,360
But since he did that

102
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:07,760
he has his own reason

103
00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:11,960
Why don't you ask him yourself?

104
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:15,560
You

105
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:17,280
You're really not in a hurry

106
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:21,240
Now Tie Fu uses a new person

107
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:22,920
to give us a chance

108
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:24,600
And

109
00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:26,520
if Uncle Suo dies

110
00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:28,200
Tie Fu will die

111
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:31,320
Only you, me and Lao Ren will die

112
00:06:31,480 --> 00:06:32,840
The rest will die

113
00:06:33,320 --> 00:06:35,200
Now Tie Fu wants to kill us

114
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:36,920
just like Nian's scolding him

115
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:39,440
The next generation won't be convinced

116
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:40,440
At this time

117
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:42,520
we should

118
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,240
unite

119
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:49,280
Now it's not the time to scold me for being a bad son

120
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:52,760
There are many people and many scenes

121
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:55,120
Don't be too serious

122
00:06:56,520 --> 00:06:57,400
Brother Ai

123
00:06:59,640 --> 00:07:00,800
You should go

124
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,360
What's the hurry?

125
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:06,400
Aren't you waiting for so long?

126
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:07,760
Uncle Buddha and Sang Tuo

127
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:09,160
will come to talk about the water house

128
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:12,400
What? You want to participate?

129
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:14,640
I tell you

130
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:16,320
Don't always use Tie Fu to pressure me

131
00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:17,960
I'm not afraid of him when I'm in the street

132
00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:20,520
Then you say it in front of him

133
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:22,120
Can you tell me?

134
00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:23,640
And you

135
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:27,160
Bye

136
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:28,240
Bye

137
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:29,800
Be good

138
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:33,520
Think about it

139
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:37,000
I'm leaving

140
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:54,520
What do you want?

141
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,200
Like annihilation.

142
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:01,040
You areculo charming.

143
00:08:12,640 --> 00:08:13,520
Sister.

144
00:08:13,880 --> 00:08:15,020
Brother Hai

145
00:08:15,420 --> 00:08:16,680
makes fun of me recently.

146
00:08:17,640 --> 00:08:19,440
If he sees me absence of Room,

147
00:08:20,140 --> 00:08:21,880
he will make trouble for me.

148
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:25,320
Okay, I know.

149
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:28,720
I'll ask C&I to come to you next time.

150
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:56,920
How was this short-term thing that you watershed in?

151
00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:10,020
Oh no.

152
00:09:10,520 --> 00:09:12,720
See?

153
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:16,600
This is all done

154
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:21,420
by the casting team.

155
00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:23,520
Dont worry

156
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:25,600
I'll be relaxed

157
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:26,160
Aly notion

158
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:35,680
Taige

159
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:36,600
I'll do

160
00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:40,480
Play the gentleman player r gegen usual

161
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,520

162
00:09:46,840 --> 00:09:47,120
Stop

00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:51,040
San

164
00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:24,220
We never meet

165
00:10:42,300 --> 00:10:42,580
Kaige

166
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:44,820
Are you satisfied?

167
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:53,920
I'm fine.

168
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:57,320
Since you're satisfied,

169
00:10:57,920 --> 00:10:59,720
can you do me a favor?

170
00:11:02,920 --> 00:11:04,320
13th is my brother.

171
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:07,920
Please don't make things difficult for him.

172
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:11,720
I hope he can give me this honor.

173
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:25,320
Chief Sang,

174
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:27,320
for this,

175
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:30,120
I must give you honor.

176
00:11:30,520 --> 00:11:31,520
Right?

177
00:11:34,120 --> 00:11:35,120
Come on.

178
00:11:38,920 --> 00:11:40,720
Chief Sang's good brother.

179
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:43,120
Sit.

180
00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:46,720
Thank you, brother.

181
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:49,320
Sang Tuo.

182
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:51,320
Sang Tuo.

183
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:53,920
I don't need your help.

184
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:08,520
What's wrong with Xiao Xiao?

185
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:11,120
Xiao Xiao has had a high fever for three days.

186
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:12,320
Her feet are very itchy.

187
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:13,520
The doctor on the island said

188
00:12:13,520 --> 00:12:15,320
if we don't send her to the hospital,

189
00:12:15,520 --> 00:12:16,920
she'll only be able to relieve her body.

190
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:19,120
Relieve her body?

191
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:20,320
Yes.

192
00:12:49,520 --> 00:12:50,520
Brother Hai.

193
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:51,720
Brother Hai.

194
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:52,720
I'm coming.

195
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:57,320
Brother Hai.

196
00:12:58,720 --> 00:12:59,720
Brother Hai.

197
00:13:00,920 --> 00:13:02,520
You can't sleep well every day.

198
00:13:03,520 --> 00:13:05,320
Did they go to the first floor yesterday?

199
00:13:05,720 --> 00:13:07,120
Brother Hai, we've been following them for a long time.

200
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:08,720
Let's have a rest.

201
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:09,720
You...

202
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:10,720
Brother Hai.

203
00:13:12,520 --> 00:13:13,520
Let me tell you.

204
00:13:13,520 --> 00:13:14,520
I'm not going to sleep.

205
00:13:14,520 --> 00:13:15,520
I'm going to sleep.

206
00:13:15,520 --> 00:13:16,520
I'm going to sleep.

207
00:13:16,520 --> 00:13:17,520
I'm going to sleep.

208
00:13:17,520 --> 00:13:18,520
I'm going to sleep.

209
00:13:18,920 --> 00:13:19,920
Let me tell you.

210
00:13:20,520 --> 00:13:22,320
Don't wait for me for the day after tomorrow.

211
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:23,720
Yes.

212
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:25,520
I promise I won't delay Brother Hai's important work.

213
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:28,120
Did you check the boat?

214
00:13:28,520 --> 00:13:29,520
Brother Hai.

215
00:13:29,520 --> 00:13:30,520
I've checked it.

216
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:33,120
Brother Hai.

217
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:34,120
Next time,

218
00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:35,320
you can ask your brother to come.

219
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:36,520
He'll come personally.

220
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:37,720
Do you want to call me?

221
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:41,320
Who told me to be so respectful?

222
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:42,520
Yes. Brother Hai is respectful.

223
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:43,720
Brother Hai is respectful.

224
00:13:43,720 --> 00:13:44,720
Brother Hai.

225
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:46,520
I've checked the boat this time.

226
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:50,120
It's not safe.

227
00:14:09,320 --> 00:14:10,320
It's still 40 degrees.

228
00:14:10,920 --> 00:14:12,120
He can't push the fever down.

229
00:14:12,520 --> 00:14:13,520
Since this morning,

230
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:15,120
he's been alerted.

231
00:14:15,520 --> 00:14:17,320
The doctor said if he can't push the fever down,

232
00:14:17,320 --> 00:14:18,520
his life will be in danger.

233
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:20,520
We can't delay it any longer.

234
00:14:32,920 --> 00:14:34,120
I thought

235
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:36,920
I'd take the chance of Basi Sea's debut

236
00:14:36,920 --> 00:14:38,320
and bring you two out secretly.

237
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:40,120
But now it seems

238
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:42,120
I can only take the boat and leave.

239
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:44,120
Take the boat?

240
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:46,920
The day after tomorrow is the day of Basi Sea's debut.

241
00:14:46,920 --> 00:14:48,120
The boat will stop at the dock

242
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:49,120
and the boat will be full.

243
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:51,120
We can leave directly.

244
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:52,520
How can I take it?

245
00:14:52,920 --> 00:14:53,920
Can I help?

246
00:14:54,520 --> 00:14:55,720
I'll think of a way.

247
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:58,320
But now the more urgent thing is

248
00:14:59,320 --> 00:15:00,920
there are guards everywhere in the building.

249
00:15:01,520 --> 00:15:03,120
How can I take you two to the dock?

250
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:13,520
Can you ask Nezha for help?

251
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:15,520
He trusts you very much now.

252
00:15:15,520 --> 00:15:16,720
If you want to see Xiaoxiao,

253
00:15:16,920 --> 00:15:18,120
he'll ask you to come up immediately.

254
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:20,720
Nezha can ask me to come up,

255
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:22,320
but he can't ask you to go out.

256
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:25,920
But it'll be easier if we can get the elevator card.

257
00:15:26,920 --> 00:15:28,320
But there are only a few team leaders

258
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:29,720
who have the elevator card.

259
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:32,720
Sang Tuo.

260
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:34,720
Isn't Sang Tuo your good brother?

261
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:36,520
Can you ask Sang Tuo for help?

262
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:21,520
You are locked in the wind and waves

263
00:17:22,120 --> 00:17:28,520
You float in the dust

264
00:17:28,920 --> 00:17:35,520
In the waves, in the whirlpool

265
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:44,520
The dawn never falls
