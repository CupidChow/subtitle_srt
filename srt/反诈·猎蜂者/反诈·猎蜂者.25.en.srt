1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
The Taoism Grandmaster

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Episode 16

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Let's go.

4
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Brother,

5
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
your friend is here.

6
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,000
You won.

7
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,000
But,

8
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
you're going to die.

9
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Uncle.

10
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Brother.

11
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,000
What do you want to do with the sound?

12
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,000
I want...

13
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
I want to be a good person.

14
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
I want to be a good person.

15
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
I want to be a good person.

16
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
I want to be a good person.

17
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
When I was a kid,

18
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:06,000
I would give a speech on my birthday.

19
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:10,000
My brother bought it for me.

20
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
At that time,

21
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:16,000
my family didn't like me.

22
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Only my brother treated me as his closest person.

23
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Then I went to the orphanage.

24
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:32,000
My stepmother was the reason

25
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:35,000
for my brother's property.

26
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
After I went to the orphanage,

27
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:50,000
I heard gunshots on my birthday.

28
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Brother,

29
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
do you know

30
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
the smell of the smoke from the bullets

31
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,000
is totally different from the smoke from the firecrackers.

32
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
The smell of bullets is more difficult.

33
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
I've been thinking,

34
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
if you're not my enemy,

35
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
you're really my brother.

36
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Brother,

37
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
it's great

38
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:33,000
that you can buy me a piece of firecrackers.

39
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Do you know it's my birthday today?

40
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
I'm just kidding.

41
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
I know I can't beat you.

42
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
But I'm already content

43
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:06,000
to sit here with you.

44
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Okay.

45
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
I should go.

46
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Before I leave,

47
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
before you die,

48
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
do you still have anything to say?

49
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Just admit it.

50
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
The silver starry sky

51
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
is like a dream.

52
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
The moon is shining

53
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
in the window.

54
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
The moon is shining

55
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
in the window.

56
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
The flowers are in full bloom

57
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
and the flowers are in full bloom.

58
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
The palm tree is in my hand.

59
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
The moon is shining in the window.

60
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
The flower is in my hand.

61
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Brother,

62
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
you're too good at this.

63
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
There are also flowers.

64
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
You can't catch me.

65
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
I'd rather die

66
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
than go to jail.

67
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
I'm sorry.

68
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,000
I'm sorry.

69
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
I'm sorry.

70
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
I'm sorry.

71
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
The moon is shining in the window.

72
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:12,800
The sky is dark

73
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:29,000
In this cross-border joint operation

74
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,400
we successfully destroyed

75
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:32,640
the fraud group that resided on Hongyao Island

76
00:06:33,320 --> 00:06:36,160
427 suspects have been caught

77
00:06:36,520 --> 00:06:38,880
But the main criminals, Sang Tuo, Nezha

78
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:40,280
and Si Yanzai are still in the group

79
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:42,960
and they have been caught for 19 billion yuan

80
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:46,800
Han Chuan

81
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:48,280
Yes

82
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:51,120
From today on, stop the investigation

83
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:52,200
Yes

84
00:06:57,600 --> 00:06:58,960
We succeeded this time

85
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:01,040
Han Chuan is the first

86
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:02,560
I don't understand

87
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:04,320
A public official went back to the country

88
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:06,360
He was suspended and had to be investigated

89
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:08,000
Don't worry

90
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:08,680
Yes

91
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:11,120
He did something illegal

92
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:13,000
But that was to spread the news

93
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,880
He had paid back the money

94
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:16,920
He had reduced the loss to the lowest

95
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:18,320
I'll tell you again

96
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:20,240
Han Chuan was suspended

97
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:21,320
He didn't commit a crime

98
00:07:21,320 --> 00:07:22,000
He is innocent

99
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,400
Why should he be investigated?

100
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:25,440
If he didn't investigate, why did he pay back the money?

101
00:07:29,080 --> 00:07:30,520
Do you think I will harm him

102
00:07:30,520 --> 00:07:31,920
or the organization will harm him?

103
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:34,680
How dare you make a fool of me?

104
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:37,960
You are the only one in the world who cares about him

105
00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:38,760
Right?

106
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:40,040
Get out

107
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:47,240
Master

108
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:49,720
Can you not listen to him?

109
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:50,760
Get out

110
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:04,360
Such a good job

111
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:16,800
OK

112
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:17,880
Stopped

113
00:08:17,880 --> 00:08:19,320
Not even picking up the phone

114
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:35,540
getting rid of aespère emphasizing on

115
00:08:35,780 --> 00:08:55,060
us being anhehe's

116
00:08:55,140 --> 00:08:58,800
mean

117
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:00,080
I'll pay you back.

118
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:01,240
I owe you tens of thousands of yuan.

119
00:09:02,520 --> 00:09:03,880
What money?

120
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:06,760
I mean, you...

121
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:08,280
I'm already on leave.

122
00:09:08,280 --> 00:09:09,440
You want money when you come back?

123
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:11,040
Do you have any sympathy?

124
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:12,960
Go away.

125
00:09:15,880 --> 00:09:16,920
You can't drink it.

126
00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:17,920
You haven't paid your debt.

127
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:21,720
Are you crazy?

128
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:22,880
It's Saturday today.

129
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:24,800
Besides, I've paid my debt to Master.

130
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:30,240
I don't have any sympathy.

131
00:09:33,520 --> 00:09:35,560
It's normal to stop investigating.

132
00:09:35,560 --> 00:09:36,880
There's nothing wrong with it.

133
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:38,120
Believe the organization.

134
00:09:38,840 --> 00:09:40,040
Don't be so angry.

135
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:43,080
Why should I be angry?

136
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:44,840
It's none of my business.

137
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:48,240
Let's have a drink.

138
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:48,960
Let's go.

139
00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:53,880
My god.

140
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:54,760
My god.

141
00:09:56,600 --> 00:09:58,440
There are still ribs in my mouth.

142
00:10:06,520 --> 00:10:07,600
Try my craftsmanship.

143
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:16,840
I think your cramp is pretty impressive too.

144
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:18,080
I'm full.

145
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:20,520
You like cooking, don't you?

146
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:21,440
How about this?

147
00:10:21,640 --> 00:10:23,360
You can wait for me to finish my work

148
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:24,760
and cook the meal.

149
00:10:24,920 --> 00:10:26,160
I'll take Yang Yang and Ya Qi

150
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:26,920
to eat with me every day.

151
00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:28,960
It'll be great if you serve us well.

152
00:10:31,520 --> 00:10:32,120
Alright.

153
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:33,560
Don't be angry.

154
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:34,880
Eat something.

155
00:10:35,160 --> 00:10:35,920
You've been working for a long time.

156
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:37,280
Who's angry?

157
00:10:39,560 --> 00:10:41,080
But looking at you,

158
00:10:42,040 --> 00:10:43,040
I've figured it out.

159
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:44,680
Listen to the organization.

160
00:10:45,160 --> 00:10:46,040
Besides,

161
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:48,080
it's not my business.

162
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:06,320
I know the reason.

163
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:09,480
I understand the process.

164
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:12,280
But I feel

165
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:15,760
that the make-up 나

166
00:11:17,280 --> 00:11:18,800
was unfair to you.

167
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:23,440
But地方

168
00:11:25,520 --> 00:11:26,680
was the worst thing.

169
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:32,720
When I was a small boy,

170
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:39,040
I always was at the edge

171
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:42,200
of my voice.

172
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:45,760
They are all suspects.

173
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:48,000
Don't take it to heart.

174
00:11:52,520 --> 00:11:54,320
If they went too far,

175
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:56,560
just tell me.

176
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:58,200
I'll call my master.

177
00:11:58,560 --> 00:11:59,240
If it doesn't work,

178
00:11:59,240 --> 00:12:01,320
I'll call the chief brother of the provincial court.

179
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:02,680
Yes.

180
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:06,520
The police are doing things in the normal way.

181
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:08,280
They won't make things difficult for me.

182
00:12:10,640 --> 00:12:11,400
Don't worry.

183
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:13,360
I'll call my master now.

184
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:14,360
Lan Fei.

185
00:12:14,760 --> 00:12:15,560
Lan Fei.

186
00:12:16,280 --> 00:12:16,880
Come here.

187
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:26,840
Lan Fei.

188
00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:30,240
Did we take the original place?

189
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:31,320
Yes.

190
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:35,640
Did we take the responsibility of the police?

191
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:36,680
Yes.

192
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:40,280
Did we do something good for the people?

193
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:41,240
Yes.

194
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:42,800
Then it's not wronged.

195
00:12:42,920 --> 00:12:43,600
Yes.

196
00:12:44,120 --> 00:12:45,720
Then it's not wronged.

197
00:12:45,960 --> 00:12:47,200
Then it's not wronged.

198
00:12:47,320 --> 00:12:49,120
Then it's not wronged.

199
00:12:52,640 --> 00:12:53,360
No.

200
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:00,000
The injustice was broken.

201
00:13:00,640 --> 00:13:02,160
But some of them escaped.

202
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:05,360
Especially that Sang Duo.

203
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:07,480
We must catch him.

204
00:13:08,840 --> 00:13:09,960
We must catch him.

205
00:13:12,080 --> 00:13:15,200
Take the village door and go to Ilan City together.

206
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:17,040
Let's go.

207
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:18,240
Okay.

208
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:19,680
Let's go.

209
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:21,360
Okay.

210
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:24,680
Take the village door and go to Ilan City together.

211
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:38,360
Welcome to the Weight要 McKinna.

212
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:40,320
The following broadcast is a notification.

213
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:42,280
in the cross-border joint law enforcement operation

214
00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:45,480
successfully eliminated an international large fraud organization

215
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:48,240
and arrested 427 criminals

216
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:50,960
and 39 women who were kidnapped.

217
00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:53,080
This operation achieved great success

218
00:13:53,080 --> 00:13:56,440
and effectively defeated the criminal behavior of cross-border telecom network fraud

219
00:13:56,440 --> 00:13:59,560
and fully demonstrated the professional upbringing of the law enforcement force in my city

220
00:13:59,560 --> 00:14:01,320
and the effectiveness of cooperation with the international community.

221
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:03,480
It is a vivid practice of the concept of

222
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:04,880
the wisdom of the people and the wisdom of life.

223
00:14:10,840 --> 00:14:11,660
Can the criminal victim be

224
00:14:11,660 --> 00:14:18,020
found and driven from Luotang as well as from Pamin hope

225
00:14:18,020 --> 00:14:24,000
to be the first policeman to be corrected and arrested?

226
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:29,080
Tan Chuan!

227
00:14:29,520 --> 00:14:32,380
You like to be a cop.

228
00:14:32,380 --> 00:14:33,880
Let's see

229
00:14:34,760 --> 00:14:37,920
if I can pull off your mounting uniform

230
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:43,920
I'll let you taste the taste of losing everything.

231
00:14:49,520 --> 00:14:50,520
Sister Zha,

232
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:53,320
are you ready to work?

233
00:14:58,120 --> 00:15:00,320
The whole street is going to be demolished.

234
00:15:00,520 --> 00:15:01,920
The demolition money is in place.

235
00:15:02,120 --> 00:15:03,720
Look, you don't sign the contract.

236
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:05,320
Everyone can't get the money.

237
00:15:05,520 --> 00:15:06,520
Everyone has complaints.

238
00:15:06,520 --> 00:15:08,120
It's hard to do anything.

239
00:15:09,320 --> 00:15:10,920
We really can't move out.

240
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:12,720
My son was lost here.

241
00:15:12,920 --> 00:15:31,980
He must have been a

242
00:15:36,520 --> 00:15:37,520
kid.

243
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:38,920
He was only this big when he was lost.

244
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:40,120
It's been three years.

245
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:41,520
He hasn't even had a chance to write.

246
00:15:41,720 --> 00:15:43,320
Do you think Huo'er is...

247
00:15:44,520 --> 00:15:45,520
What?

248
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:47,920
What do you want to say?

249
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:49,720
Why did you curse my son's death?

250
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:50,920
Did you lose your son?

251
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:53,520
Do you know how we've been living these two years?

252
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:55,520
I'm telling you, the child is my life.

253
00:15:55,720 --> 00:15:56,520
If I can't find the child for a day,

254
00:15:56,720 --> 00:15:57,520
I won't move out for a day.

255
00:15:57,720 --> 00:15:58,920
What should I do if I don't move out?

256
00:15:59,120 --> 00:15:59,720
Understand.

257
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:00,720
What do you understand?

258
00:16:00,920 --> 00:16:01,520
You don't understand.

259
00:16:01,720 --> 00:16:02,720
You all don't understand.

260
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:03,720
I know.

261
00:16:06,520 --> 00:16:07,520
I know.

262
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:12,920
Tell me.

263
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:16,920
What is my son doing now?

264
00:16:19,720 --> 00:16:22,320
He must be in his thirties now.

265
00:16:24,520 --> 00:16:26,520
Don't you have too much homework?

266
00:16:29,320 --> 00:16:31,520
At least, he hasn't been bullied.

267
00:16:32,520 --> 00:16:33,720
I'm sorry.

268
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:37,720
I'm sorry.

269
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:41,720
In a few days,

270
00:16:44,520 --> 00:16:45,920
it's his birthday.

271
00:16:50,120 --> 00:16:53,520
I wonder if anyone will buy him a cake.

272
00:17:02,520 --> 00:17:03,520
Hello.

273
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:04,720
Hello.

274
00:17:05,120 --> 00:17:06,120
Mr. Zheng.

275
00:17:06,320 --> 00:17:29,160
I've checked your

276
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:32,720
birthday card.

277
00:17:32,920 --> 00:17:33,920
I'm sorry.

278
00:17:34,120 --> 00:17:35,120
I'm sorry.

279
00:17:35,320 --> 00:17:36,320
I'm sorry.

280
00:17:36,520 --> 00:17:37,520
I'm sorry.

281
00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:38,720
I'm sorry.

282
00:17:38,920 --> 00:17:39,920
I'm sorry.

283
00:17:40,120 --> 00:17:41,120
I'm sorry.

284
00:17:41,320 --> 00:17:42,320
I'm sorry.

285
00:17:42,520 --> 00:17:43,520
I'm sorry.

286
00:17:43,720 --> 00:17:44,720
I'm sorry.

287
00:17:44,920 --> 00:17:45,920
I'm sorry.

288
00:17:46,120 --> 00:17:47,120
I'm sorry.

289
00:17:47,320 --> 00:17:48,320
I'm sorry.

290
00:17:48,520 --> 00:17:49,520
I'm sorry.

291
00:17:49,720 --> 00:17:50,720
I'm sorry.

292
00:17:50,920 --> 00:17:51,920
I'm sorry.

293
00:17:52,120 --> 00:17:53,120
I'm sorry.

294
00:17:53,320 --> 00:17:54,320
I'm sorry.

295
00:17:54,520 --> 00:17:55,520
I'm sorry.

296
00:17:55,720 --> 00:17:56,720
I'm sorry.

297
00:17:56,920 --> 00:17:57,920
I'm sorry.

298
00:17:58,120 --> 00:17:59,120
I'm sorry.

299
00:17:59,320 --> 00:18:00,320
I'm sorry.

300
00:18:01,320 --> 00:18:04,320
Silver starry sky,

301
00:18:04,520 --> 00:18:07,520
twinkling like a dream.

302
00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:14,520
The dark clouds rise and fall from the windows.

303
00:18:15,320 --> 00:18:18,120
The finger-picking light,

304
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:21,320
melting and freezing.

305
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:23,120
In my palm,

306
00:18:23,320 --> 00:18:27,320
holding tightly the candle.

307
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:31,320
In the mist,

308
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:34,320
the nameless bell

309
00:18:34,520 --> 00:18:40,320
knows where to go and where to go.

310
00:18:40,520 --> 00:18:43,320
The light fades,

311
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:44,320
the night color,

312
00:18:44,520 --> 00:18:46,320
the fireflies,

313
00:18:46,520 --> 00:18:47,520
flickering.

314
00:18:47,720 --> 00:18:48,320
The light,

315
00:18:48,520 --> 00:18:50,320
along the way,

316
00:18:50,520 --> 00:18:54,320
is the one that keeps the snake alive.

317
00:18:55,320 --> 00:19:02,320
The clouds are entangled in the wind and waves.

318
00:19:02,520 --> 00:19:05,320
In the dust,

319
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:09,320
the wind is floating.

320
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:12,320
In the cold ice,

321
00:19:12,520 --> 00:19:16,320
in the whirlpool above,

322
00:19:16,520 --> 00:19:21,320
the dawn never fades.

323
00:19:21,320 --> 00:19:26,320
The clouds fall.
