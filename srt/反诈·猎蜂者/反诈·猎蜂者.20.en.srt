The King of Blaze

4
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Brother, you've been here for so long.

5
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Aren't you curious about what the seventh floor is?

6
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
I'll show you today.

7
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:04,000
The King of Blaze

8
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Brother, these gold, the money,

9
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:13,000
and everything here are ours.

10
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
You can take these money as you like.

11
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
You don't have to agree with me.

12
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,000
You can spend it however you want.

13
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Just spend it however you want.

14
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
You can use it to light a candle.

15
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
How about it?

16
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:34,000
The King of Blaze

17
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
We need it.

18
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
What do you need?

19
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Don't answer yet.

20
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Let me think.

21
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
I know.

22
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
You need to be a police.

23
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Right?

24
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
You need to uphold justice.

25
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:59,000
You need to kill all criminals.

26
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Brother, take this money.

27
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
What are you doing?

28
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
From tomorrow,

29
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:17,000
I'll let Da'an be a new identity for you.

30
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
From tomorrow,

31
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:22,000
you'll be a great,

32
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:26,000
glorious member of the Eastern Police.

33
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:31,000
You can arrest all criminals in the Eastern State.

34
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:34,000
You can uphold justice.

35
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Here.

36
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
All the money here

37
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:42,000
is your money.

38
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Of course, brother.

39
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:50,000
If you don't like the law of the Eastern State,

40
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
I can change it for you.

41
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
You don't know,

42
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
the local officials here

43
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,000
like gold very much.

44
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:06,000
I can use this gold to bribe them.

45
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,000
I can change all the laws

46
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
you don't like

47
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
into the way you like.

48
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
How about it?

49
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Are you really crazy?

50
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:22,000
How can I be crazy?

51
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:26,000
We need to be confident, brother.

52
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
These laws

53
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
are all made by people.

54
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Those who have power and power can make decisions.

55
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Why can't we make decisions?

56
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:40,000
You can give up.

57
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:43,000
I can't be like you.

58
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
I...

59
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:48,000
I believe you'll really become my brother.

60
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Just like I believe you'll really come to save me.

61
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Right?

62
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Why don't you take me to the second floor?

63
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:08,000
I'll let you live here.

64
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
I love you.

65
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Okay.

66
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Go.

67
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Go.

68
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Go.

69
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Clean up the gold house for me.

70
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
My brother lives here in the future.

71
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
No problem.

72
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Brother.

73
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,600
You must think for your sister

74
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:38,320
I tell you

75
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:42,560
Da'an is on the way back

76
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:45,920
Don't forget your sister and Li Bailing

77
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:48,160
Are still in the east

78
00:04:48,520 --> 00:04:49,360
What are you doing?

79
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:02,280
I don't call Da'an

80
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:07,500
D punct means aMich

81
00:05:07,820 --> 00:05:08,560
Annoying

82
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:11,180

83
00:05:11,740 --> 00:05:13,580
We respect what you do

84
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:16,440
D

85
00:05:18,700 --> 00:05:20,580
Please see my progress

86
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:30,440
O

87
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:38,160
You two are here to disturb our work

88
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:39,880
Go

89
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:41,520
Go inside first

90
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:42,720
Stay here

91
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:43,600
Brother

92
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:46,760
We were hungry just now

93
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:48,480
We want to go to the toilet

94
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:51,880
Okay

95
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:53,200
I'll take you there

96
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:54,320
Follow me

97
00:05:58,520 --> 00:05:59,280
What's wrong?

98
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:01,360
The police have a problem

99
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:02,360
They want to catch us

100
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:03,840
There is a back door

101
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:05,120
Let's get out of here

102
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:06,560
Go

103
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:09,040
Stop!

104
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:09,960
Don't move

105
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:10,920
Don't move

106
00:06:12,760 --> 00:06:14,160
Stop!

107
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:24,480
Don't move

108
00:06:34,840 --> 00:06:36,280
Li Bailiang, what are you doing?

109
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:38,360
Go

110
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:43,880
Li Bailiang

111
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:45,040
Li Bailiang, get out of here

112
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:46,160
I didn't hear you

113
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:46,720

114
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:48,000

115
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:48,920

116
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:50,560

117
00:06:50,840 --> 00:06:52,000
We didn't hear you

118
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:53,240

119
00:06:58,120 --> 00:06:58,960
Get out of here

120
00:06:59,040 --> 00:06:59,960
We didn't hear you

121
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:01,400
We didn't hear you

122
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:05,080
Li Bailiang

123
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:11,680
Li Bailiang

124

Stop

128
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:25,920
Li Bailiang

129
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:26,880
Li Bailiang

130
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:28,520
Li Bailiang

131
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:29,520
Li Bailiang

132
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:33,120
I want to get out

133
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:37,120
I don't want to hide in the darkness

134
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:39,120
I just know that I'm lost

135
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:41,120
and forget my old dreams

136
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:45,120
I'm looking for the light at the end of the world

137
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:49,120
I've been in the dream for many times

138
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:51,120
They all want me to give up

139
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:52,120
and be stubborn

140
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:54,120
This is my faith

141
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:55,120
There is still a song

142
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:58,120
I won't surrender if I have to

143
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:00,120
The suspect in the water room

144
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:02,120
gave us an important clue

145
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:05,120
There is a black box in the middle server in the water room

146
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:07,120
Every thousand yuan they fraud

147
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:08,120
and all the transaction records

148
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:10,120
will be in this black box

149
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:13,120
This time, we must protect this important evidence

150
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:14,120
Without evidence

151
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:16,120
Even if they are brought back

152
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:18,120
we can't catch them or betray them

153
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:23,120
Black box

154
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:33,120
Where did you come from?

155
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:52,120
They won't be caught

156
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:03,680
Don't make fun of me

157
00:09:03,900 --> 00:09:04,880
Did you do this for shit?

158
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:05,800
No

159
00:09:06,100 --> 00:09:07,000
I came up with it

160
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:07,740
Couldn't go with someone else

161
00:09:07,740 --> 00:09:09,380
Then stay with your dad

162
00:09:12,700 --> 00:09:13,700
You are h차 drowned

163
00:09:13,820 --> 00:09:14,740
I liked you

164
00:09:16,260 --> 00:09:17,620
Have you been alone for long?

165
00:09:19,180 --> 00:09:20,980
I'd been searching for you

166
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:23,160
These times

167
00:09:24,180 --> 00:09:26,920
I've left this Self-Gather and bad vibes

168
00:09:27,540 --> 00:09:28,580

00:09:28,580 --> 00:09:31,580
The only thing I have is my money

170
00:09:32,980 --> 00:09:34,380
What about the rest?

171
00:09:34,980 --> 00:09:36,780
Uncle, don't worry

172
00:09:37,180 --> 00:09:38,980
I can fight here

173
00:09:39,380 --> 00:09:40,780
I can hold on

174
00:09:41,780 --> 00:09:43,380
If he insists on going back to China?

175
00:09:47,180 --> 00:09:47,780
No

176
00:09:49,580 --> 00:09:51,380
I believe I can change him

177
00:09:53,380 --> 00:09:55,780
People must have their own purpose in this world

178
00:09:56,380 --> 00:09:57,780
As long as he has his own purpose

179
00:09:58,580 --> 00:10:01,180
I can open his shoes

180
00:10:28,580 --> 00:10:29,380

00:11:32,620 --> 00:11:32,740
I

198
00:11:32,740 --> 00:11:33,040
I

199
00:11:34,580 --> 00:11:34,940
We kill them

200
00:11:35,220 --> 00:11:35,980
I

201
00:11:39,900 --> 00:11:41,200
We win

202
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,120
It's been 23 years

203
00:11:46,460 --> 00:11:47,440
impression

204
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:48,380
Don't worry

205
00:11:48,740 --> 00:11:49,340
It's too hard

206
00:11:50,180 --> 00:11:51,500
You'd better fight

207
00:11:51,740 --> 00:11:52,080
Yes

208
00:11:52,700 --> 00:11:54,180
I have about four people

209
00:11:54,500 --> 00:11:54,800
seven

210
00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:55,520
and one

211
00:11:55,660 --> 00:11:56,180
five

212
00:11:56,340 --> 00:11:56,840
six

213
00:11:57,140 --> 00:11:57,440
seven

214
00:11:57,440 --> 00:11:59,920
No, the prison is gone

215
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:05,720
Go

216
00:12:06,040 --> 00:12:07,360
Go to call the security guard

217
00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:08,360
Call someone

218
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:09,480
Third brother

219
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:10,760
This ventilation tunnel

220
00:12:10,760 --> 00:12:12,240
is not only in the entire building

221
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:13,440
but in every room

222
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:15,800
Our security guards are not enough now

223
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:18,800
Then go and call everyone

224
00:12:19,080 --> 00:12:19,520
Go

225
00:12:19,520 --> 00:12:20,160
Okay, okay

226
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:21,440
Okay, okay, okay

227
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:24,000
You go too

228
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:26,840
I have to protect you

229
00:12:27,160 --> 00:12:27,720
It's okay

230
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,080
He won't hurt me

231
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:29,880
Go

232
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:39,640
Anshun

233
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:42,920
What on earth do you want?

234
00:14:26,840 --> 00:14:27,880
Anshun

235
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:30,800
We want to look

236
00:14:32,640 --> 00:14:34,160
everyone

237
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:35,160
pack up

238
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:36,320
его

239
00:15:26,840 --> 00:15:30,840
Don't worry. I believe we can find the Chinese police soon.

240
00:15:56,840 --> 00:15:57,840
Han Chuan.
