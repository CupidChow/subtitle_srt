1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,760
Don't you ê²ªYa

2
00:00:04,760 --> 00:00:06,760
The Taoism Grandmaster

3
00:00:06,760 --> 00:00:08,760
Episode 16

4
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:30,760
A'Rui.

5
00:00:32,360 --> 00:00:33,360
Uncle He.

6
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:34,960
Uncle He.

7
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:39,160
I'll kill him.

8
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:42,360
Wait.

9
00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:46,160
Give me an explanation.

10
00:00:46,760 --> 00:00:47,760
Uncle He.

11
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:50,360
Ever since the Black Ghost Cave lost to me,

12
00:00:50,360 --> 00:00:51,960
he has been staring at me.

13
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:53,360
He wants to kill me.

14
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:55,160
I know his true nature.

15
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:57,360
Instead of being a thief,

16
00:00:57,360 --> 00:00:58,960
I'd rather kill him.

17
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:01,360
I know the rules of the abode.

18
00:01:01,560 --> 00:01:02,760
I'll accept the punishment.

19
00:01:03,160 --> 00:01:04,760
But I can't stand

20
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:06,960
a man like Black Ghost Cave.

21
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:08,360
Fine.

22
00:01:09,160 --> 00:01:11,160
Since you took the initiative,

23
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:12,960
this matter

24
00:01:14,360 --> 00:01:15,760
ends here.

25
00:01:24,760 --> 00:01:25,960
Some time ago,

26
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:28,960
you made a movie for a long time

27
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:30,960
without any subculture.

28
00:01:31,960 --> 00:01:33,160
I admire you.

29
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:34,560
You're tough.

30
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:36,360
You have guts.

31
00:01:36,760 --> 00:01:37,760
But

32
00:01:38,360 --> 00:01:39,960
I want to see you

33
00:01:40,160 --> 00:01:41,560
earn money.

34
00:01:42,760 --> 00:01:43,760
Thank you, Uncle He.

35
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:54,360
Du.

36
00:01:54,760 --> 00:01:55,560
Didn't you say you'd give me a medicine?

37
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:56,760
How could you kill me?

38
00:01:57,560 --> 00:01:58,960
I'm telling you it's poison.

39
00:01:58,960 --> 00:01:59,760
How dare you!

40
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:00,760
You're killing me.

41
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:01,760
What's wrong with killing?

42
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:03,160
I did it for Brother 13.

43
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:04,960
You know

44
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:05,960
what kind of person Black Ghost Cave is.

45
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:08,360
It's either him or us.

46
00:02:08,760 --> 00:02:09,360
Du.

47
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:10,560
What... What's wrong with me?

48
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:12,560
This abode,

49
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:13,360
this place,

50
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:14,560
what can I do?

51
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:15,760
Stop acting.

52
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:18,160
Since you started working with Brother 13,

53
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:19,760
I know you have a problem.

54
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:29,560
I have a problem.

55
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:32,760
I'll ask you again.

56
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:34,360
What do I have?

57
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:38,360
Brother.

58
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:41,560
Brother.

59
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:44,560
Brother.

60
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:48,360
What's wrong with you?

61
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:49,760
What's wrong with you?

62
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:52,360
I don't know.

63
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:54,160
I can't stop thinking about you.

64
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:56,760
I can't stop thinking about you.

65
00:02:57,760 --> 00:02:58,760
Are you okay?

66
00:02:58,760 --> 00:02:59,960
I'm fine.

67
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:01,680
What's going on?

68
00:03:01,880 --> 00:03:03,720
Brother, it's none of your business

69
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:05,520
It's all my fault

70
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:09,280
I was the one who scared Brother Rui

71
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:12,200
I feel bad when I see you

72
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,000
coming down from the movie

73
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:16,480
I'm determined to kill Hei Guidong

74
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:17,760
I can't kill him this time

75
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:18,440
I'll kill him

76
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:19,160
Sang Luo

77
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:22,000
I want to kill Hei Guidong

78
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:24,880
but I want to be fair

79
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:27,760
You're so secretive

80
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:29,560
You know there's no difference between them?

81
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:31,800
And

82
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:34,880
you can't kill anyone

83
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:37,160
Mom

84
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:43,200
I know, Brother

85
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:45,800
I'll listen to you

86
00:03:55,080 --> 00:03:56,040
The two team leaders on the second floor

87
00:03:56,040 --> 00:03:57,560
one is cruel and the other is good

88
00:03:58,560 --> 00:03:59,960
I have one more thing to warn you

89
00:03:59,960 --> 00:04:02,080
The one standing on my side is my friend

90
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:04,080
The rest are opponents

91
00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:07,160
Don't do it

92
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:07,640
Brother

93
00:04:07,640 --> 00:04:09,120
We have to go to the second floor

94
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:11,000
I'm determined to kill Hei Guidong

95
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,960
I'll kill him today

96
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:16,000
I'll be punished here

97
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:16,640
He's not staying

98
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:17,400
He's not staying

99
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:18,960
They're all on the seventh floor

100
00:04:21,520 --> 00:04:23,360
Now I can stand on the second floor

101
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:25,480
and successfully contact Anfei

102
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:28,520
Next, not only do I have to save Xiaoxiao

103
00:04:29,080 --> 00:04:31,200
but also find a way to get rid of the whole injustice

104
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:34,680
What I have to do now is to kill Hei Guidong first

105
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:36,760
and then use Basi Sea and Nezha

106
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:38,800
to go up step by step

107
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:40,960
to get their core evidence

108
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:42,400
and send it back to China

109
00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:52,320
Brother

110
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:54,800
Shisan came here to kill us

111
00:04:55,160 --> 00:04:55,880
He's a liar

112
00:04:55,880 --> 00:04:56,800
He's not punished

113
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:57,400
Brother

114
00:04:57,440 --> 00:04:58,800
Kill him

115
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:01,520
You want to kill him?

116
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:03,840
How can we be so angry?

117
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:04,840
You

118
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:06,320
think twice

119
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:08,040
Think twice

120
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:10,440
You know you're a liar

121
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:13,360
but you have a simple and rough way

122
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:14,840
to kill him

123
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:16,640
Put him down

124
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:19,120
Put him down

125
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:19,720
Put him down

126
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:28,320
Eat

127
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:32,840
Brother

128
00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:34,080
Xiaoxiao

129
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:35,520
Nothing

130
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:36,440
You think the fate is really over

131
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:37,200
Xiaoxiao

132
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:39,520
since you killed Hei Gui

133
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:43,000
what should we do?

134
00:05:56,360 --> 00:05:57,280
There's a girl on the sixth floor

135
00:05:57,400 --> 00:05:58,160
Let's go.

136
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:00,040
You two, I'll go to the toilet.

137
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:00,840
Dongge.

138
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:01,360
Dongge.

139
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:02,760
I'll help you.

140
00:06:03,760 --> 00:06:05,640
Zifan, I'm going to the police station.

141
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:08,080
Wait.

142
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:11,760
Xiong,

143
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:13,360
it's so late.

144
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:14,760
Why are you looking for my brother?

145
00:06:14,760 --> 00:06:16,000
Shut up. Go to sleep.

146
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:28,000
Go.

147
00:06:32,440 --> 00:06:33,120
What are you doing?

148
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:35,040
Sphhh.

149
00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:38,520
They won't clean up my car.

150
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:40,600
Bro.

151
00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:43,040
Are you out of mind?

152
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:44,720
Bro.

153
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:47,240
Tuck in.

154
00:06:47,320 --> 00:06:47,720
Tuck in!

155
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:50,840
occupying us.

156
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:54,600
OK.

157
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:55,640
Look.

158
00:06:55,920 --> 00:06:57,040
They won't clean our cars.

159
00:06:58,040 --> 00:07:00,200
You are really a brother and sister.

160
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:01,800
Shisan.

161
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:05,120
It seems that I don't know you

162
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:06,520
well enough.

163
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:08,480
But luckily,

164
00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:10,120
she has said

165
00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:11,440
everything she should.

166
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:13,560
Now it's your turn.

167
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:16,800
If you two are different,

168
00:07:17,760 --> 00:07:18,680
I'm sorry.

169
00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:20,640
You will all die.

170
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:25,160
Just tell me.

171
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:26,280
What are you thinking about?

172
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:28,680
Don't touch her!

173
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:35,200
Uncle Fang.

174
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:36,520
She is my sister.

175
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:38,320
She is in the Eastern Gang.

176
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:40,600
I don't know how she got in.

177
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:42,760
But I came to the original area

178
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:44,880
partly for the police.

179
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:47,000
And partly for the show.

180
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:48,120
Uncle Fang.

181
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:49,720
You are not on the same side.

182
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:51,600
She didn't say that Brother Shisan

183
00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:53,160
was hiding from the police in the country.

184
00:07:53,320 --> 00:07:54,600
Of course she doesn't know.

185
00:07:55,320 --> 00:07:56,240
Who would do that with a family

186
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:57,800
if she knew it?

187
00:07:58,520 --> 00:07:59,680
But you

188
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:02,120
have no common sense.

189
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:03,880
No wonder you can't get the performance.

190
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:05,160
You are dying.

191
00:08:05,320 --> 00:08:06,320
And you are still talking back.

192
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:07,640
Looking for my sister?

193
00:08:07,960 --> 00:08:10,040
Why didn't you say it at the beginning?

194
00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:11,520
Don't mind

195
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:13,080
why my sister and I came in.

196
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:14,560
But we both

197
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:16,680
are doing something valuable in the original area.

198
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,520
But this Black Ghost Cave

199
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:19,840
is jealous of me.

200
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:21,960
It targets me again and again.

201
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:22,920
If I let it know

202
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:24,000
that I have a sister,

203
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:25,920
who knows what it will do?

204
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:26,960
Uncle Fang.

205
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:29,080
I don't like to hear that.

206
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:30,880
A team

207
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:32,800
only looks at the position and not at the performance.

208
00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:34,760
It can't go far.

209
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:37,520
So you mean

210
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,600
to let me kill the Black Ghost Cave?

211
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:43,160
You are so ridiculous.

212
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:44,240
No.

213
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:46,320
Uncle Fang.

214
00:08:48,040 --> 00:08:49,200
Let it go.

215
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:52,240
I don't want it to be in this business.

216
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:53,840
Let it go.

217
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,440
Let me do whatever I want.

218
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:57,400
I'll do the performance.

219
00:08:57,840 --> 00:08:58,680
Okay?

220
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:01,360
Okay.

221
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:02,240
Uncle Fang.

222
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:04,400
You can trust him.

223
00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:09,800
You have been here for so long.

224
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:11,880
You haven't given me a single big order.

225
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:12,800
How about this?

226
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,080
I'll give you two days to give me a big order.

227
00:09:15,280 --> 00:09:16,120
If you do it,

228
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:18,680
I'll send your sister back.

229
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:19,520
What?

230
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:21,520
20 million.

231
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:23,240
Take it.

232
00:09:24,520 --> 00:09:26,040
It's worth it.

233
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:32,400
No.

234
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:35,040
20 million in two days.

235
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:37,160
Aren't youaws Dansy?

236
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:46,280
Let me chop that thing off.

237
00:09:46,280 --> 00:09:49,800
No!

238
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:14,880
You can say that again.

239
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:15,760
Would you like to?

240
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:19,380
a sudden ceremony ofATG

241
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:24,240
Let go

242
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:26,980
oa

243
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:32,680
Give you two

244
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:34,620
Please let them go

245
00:10:36,100 --> 00:10:37,700
This treatment

246
00:10:38,340 --> 00:10:39,540
Sana?

247
00:10:44,940 --> 00:10:47,060
It is true brother and sister's love.

248
00:10:48,140 --> 00:10:50,820
If two million can't be opened,

249
00:10:52,420 --> 00:10:54,100
then I will go with you

250
00:10:54,100 --> 00:10:56,020
to the prepared one.

251
00:11:07,700 --> 00:11:08,780
Very well.

252
00:11:09,060 --> 00:11:09,740
Go.

253
00:11:35,740 --> 00:11:36,500
Mr. Shan.

254
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:08,260
I thought this place was more cool

255
00:12:09,420 --> 00:12:11,340
To be honest

256
00:12:12,260 --> 00:12:14,740
no one can get this money

257
00:12:15,660 --> 00:12:16,060
Give me

258
00:12:20,700 --> 00:12:33,280
Your Ð¾Ð´Ð½Ð¾

259
00:12:36,500 --> 00:12:38,180
Secretary leads the way

260
00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:43,220
You have evidence

261
00:12:43,300 --> 00:12:43,700
Brother Yin He

262
00:12:43,780 --> 00:12:44,280
Oh

263
00:12:44,300 --> 00:12:44,500
go

264
00:12:48,580 --> 00:12:49,060
Xiagle

265
00:12:51,340 --> 00:12:52,700
do me a favor

266
00:13:06,500 --> 00:13:08,100
You have to be a rich man

267
00:13:08,580 --> 00:13:10,620
You have to show your true skills this time

268
00:13:10,780 --> 00:13:12,380
I see. Go back to your work

269
00:13:22,940 --> 00:13:24,860
Brother, look at him

270
00:13:25,820 --> 00:13:28,300
He can still calm down under such pressure

271
00:13:28,460 --> 00:13:29,740
He's quite something

272
00:13:33,660 --> 00:13:35,580
If he can pass this test

273
00:13:36,500 --> 00:13:37,940
you have to keep an eye on him

274
00:13:39,420 --> 00:13:41,140
Don't bite me

275
00:13:42,620 --> 00:13:44,020
when he gets up

276
00:14:06,500 --> 00:14:33,420
I'll send a reply to the paper

277
00:14:33,460 --> 00:14:35,300
Go and bring me the fitted documents

278
00:14:35,300 --> 00:14:37,820
Next time when we have the new Ð

279
00:14:37,820 --> 00:14:39,020
You better leave

280
00:15:35,300 --> 00:15:36,300
I'm sorry.

281
00:15:36,300 --> 00:15:37,300
I'm sorry.

282
00:15:37,300 --> 00:15:38,300
I'm sorry.

283
00:15:38,300 --> 00:15:39,300

I'm sorry.

288
00:15:43,300 --> 00:15:44,300
I'm sorry.

289
00:15:44,300 --> 00:15:45,300
I'm sorry.

290
00:15:45,300 --> 00:15:46,300

I'm sorry.

293
00:15:48,300 --> 00:15:49,300
I'm sorry.

294
00:15:49,300 --> 00:15:50,300
I'm sorry.

295
00:15:50,300 --> 00:15:51,300
I'm sorry.

I'm sorry.

297
00:15:52,300 --> 00:15:53,300
I'm sorry.

298
00:15:53,300 --> 00:15:54,300
I'm sorry.

299
00:15:54,300 --> 00:15:55,300
I'm sorry.

300
00:15:55,300 --> 00:15:56,300
I'm sorry.

301
00:15:56,300 --> 00:15:57,300
I'm sorry.

302
00:15:57,300 --> 00:15:58,300
I'm sorry.

303
00:15:58,300 --> 00:15:59,300
I'm sorry.

304
00:15:59,300 --> 00:16:00,300
I'm sorry.

305
00:16:00,300 --> 00:16:01,300
I'm sorry.

306
00:16:01,300 --> 00:16:02,300
