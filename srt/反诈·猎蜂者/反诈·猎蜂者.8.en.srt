1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,800
lipbuds

2
00:00:06,680 --> 00:00:07,720
surrounding

3
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:26,920
thirteen

4
00:00:26,920 --> 00:00:28,320
Brother Hai.

5
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:28,920
Brother Hai.

6
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:30,920
Brother Xie San.

7
00:00:30,920 --> 00:00:33,920
How was your night?

8
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:35,920
Brother Hai.

9
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:37,920
You don't misunderstand. I was just about to explain.

10
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:39,920
No need to explain. I understand.

11
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:41,920
What are you doing? Why are you so serious?

12
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:43,920
Black Ghost, you lost.

13
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:45,920
You lost the game.

14
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:47,920
You're making trouble.

15
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:51,920
How are you, brothers?

16
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:53,920
So good.

17
00:00:54,920 --> 00:00:56,920
Look at him.

18
00:00:56,920 --> 00:00:58,920
Look.

19
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:00,920
He's not a bad guy.

20
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:05,920
Look at him.

21
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:07,920
Look.

22
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:11,920
Look at him.

23
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:13,920
Look at him.

24
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:17,920
You're so good.

25
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:25,920
Are you curious?

26
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:27,920
Look.

27
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:29,920
Brother 13.

28
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:31,920
I think you're not

29
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:33,920
feeling bad for him today, are you?

30
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:35,920
Black Ghost.

31
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:39,920
Our game is over.

32
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:41,920
What else do you want?

33
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:43,920
I didn't win.

34
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:45,920
The game will never end.

35
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:47,920
This bad guy

36
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:49,920
didn't let me make money yesterday.

37
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:51,920
Today,

38
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:53,920
I'll let him pay for it.

39
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:55,920
Pay for it.

40
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:57,920
Look.

41
00:01:57,920 --> 00:01:59,920
Is it him?

42
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:01,920
Look. Does he look like him?

43
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:03,920
It's him. Xiao Yang just sent it this morning.

44
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:05,920
It's him.

45
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:07,920
Look. It's him.

46
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:13,920
Why do you look so serious?

47
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:15,920
So shameless.

48
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:17,920
It's him.

49
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:19,920
So shameless.

50
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:21,920
Look.

51
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:23,920
He's so bad.

52
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:25,920
He's so bad.

53
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:27,920
Look at his ID.

54
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:29,920
Look.

55
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:31,920
It's him.

56
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:33,920
Look.

57
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:35,920
It's him.

58
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:37,920
Look.

59
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:39,920
Look.

60
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:41,920
It's him.

61
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:43,920
Look.

62
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:45,920
Is it him?

63
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:47,920
He's behind it.

64
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:03,920
He's so bad.

65
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:05,920
So stupid.

66
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:07,920
No wonder you were cheated.

67
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:09,920
You can't blame your mom.

68
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:11,920
She's not stupid.

69
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:12,920
You're so mean.

70
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:14,120
You're so mean.

71
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:15,120
Stop it.

72
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:17,360
I didn't know you were awake.

73
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:18,600
Why?

74
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:19,400
Why?

75
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:20,400
Why did you wake up?

76
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:22,040
Go away.

77
00:03:22,040 --> 00:03:22,680
Go away.

78
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:23,280
Go away.

79
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:24,160
Go away.

80
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:25,360
What's going on?

81
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:26,280
Let's go back.

82
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:27,440
Hurry up.

83
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:29,720
It's a building.

84
00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:30,880
Hurry up.

85
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:43,680
I didn't expect her to die.

86
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,640
Who knew she was so stubborn?

87
00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:47,240
At first,

88
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:49,440
I pretended to be her mother's doctor.

89
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:50,760
I called her

90
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:52,920
and said her mother was seriously ill.

91
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:54,040
Then?

92
00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:56,000
I pretended to be a member of the hospital's staff.

93
00:03:56,280 --> 00:03:57,240
I asked her to pay the bill.

94
00:03:57,240 --> 00:03:58,600
15,000 yuan.

95
00:03:58,600 --> 00:03:59,280
She came in.

96
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:02,680
I was so worried.

97
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:03,880
I thought she was sick.

98
00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:04,760
I thought she was sick.

99
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:05,760
I was so worried.

100
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:06,760
I was so worried.

101
00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:07,760
I was so worried.

102
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:08,760
I was so worried.

103
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:09,760
I was so worried.

104
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:10,760
I was so worried.

105
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:11,760
I was so worried.

106
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:13,320
I was so worried.

107
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:14,640
I was so worried.

108
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:15,520
I was so worried.

109
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:16,840
I was so worried.

110
00:04:16,840 --> 00:04:17,840
But I realized

111
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:19,280
I patted someone and she made it up.

112
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:21,520
So

113
00:04:21,520 --> 00:04:22,520
I passed on

114
00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:24,160
all the money.

115
00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:25,680
Not only that,

116
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:27,480
everyone gave her the money,

117
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:29,920
but I must help her.

118
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:31,520
Cool!

119
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:34,800
She paid

120
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:36,400
her debt

121
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:39,400
with her index finger on my shoulder.

122
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:40,960
But at that time,

123
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:43,440
At first, you were like your 13th brother

124
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,440
and you pretended to be my brother

125
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:47,560
I said one thing

126
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:49,960
Guys, what did I say?

127
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:51,720
What did you say?

128
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:52,880
I said

129
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:55,520
if your mom died

130
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:56,880
she would be dead

131
00:04:57,160 --> 00:04:58,240
She would be dead

132
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:01,720
Look at Hu Pei

133
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:04,200
She's really a big girl

134
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:06,200
I didn't waste her video

135
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:08,600
I sold it to a loan company for more than ten thousand

136
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,120
It doesn't matter if she died

137
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:11,280
If her mom didn't die

138
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:13,040
she would be lying on the bed

139
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:14,640
and paying for it

140
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:16,000
Right, guys?

141
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,120
Yes

142
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:18,120
Brother Si Hai

143
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:21,720
This is what I'll get

144
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:24,120
I'll beat you

145
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:25,520
Beat him

146
00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:39,320
Uncle He

147
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:41,800
We do business as we do business, right?

148
00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:43,480
Haigui Dong lost

149
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:44,600
and lost his life

150
00:05:44,760 --> 00:05:45,920
He's dead

151
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:46,280
You said...

152
00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:47,320
It's none of your business

153
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:48,800
if he's dead

154
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:50,840
Shi San beat the chief

155
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:53,400
and had to do as the rules said

156
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:54,640
You're lying

157
00:05:55,320 --> 00:05:56,760
Why did Shi San beat you?

158
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:59,120
Isn't it because you did too much

159
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:00,840
and you were afraid of being watched by the Chinese police?

160
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:02,600
Our business would be affected, right?

161
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:03,840
You're lying

162
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:05,400
It's your tribe

163
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:06,480
You're lying

164
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:07,400
You hit me

165
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:08,280
I'll beat you

166
00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:09,880
Don't beat me

167
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:11,400
Are you done?

168
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:24,440
You two chiefs

169
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:26,400
are so noisy

170
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:30,400
It's a shame to disturb the peace of the Buddha

171
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:35,320
Haigui Dong

172
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,400
We do business

173
00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:39,520
and make money

174
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:41,760
as much as possible

175
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:42,800
Yes, Uncle Fu

176
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:43,840
I know

177
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:02,720
Uncle Fu

178
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:06,960
I just don't want to talk to you

179
00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:15,160
cleansed

180
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:18,640
I need to see Dr. Gu

181
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:19,400
Tell me

182
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:21,680
Who are you?

183
00:07:24,520 --> 00:07:25,360
I'm here

184
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:29,200
have I just come for tea?

185
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:32,520
I'm milk-leaf tea

186
00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:34,520
I'm the one who's in charge.

187
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:39,520
You have to do the same.

188
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:51,520
The words you said just now

189
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:56,520
were taught by the police, right?

190
00:07:56,520 --> 00:07:58,520
Uncle Pan,

191
00:07:58,520 --> 00:08:00,520
that boy, Shisan,

192
00:08:00,520 --> 00:08:02,520
was indeed quite impulsive.

193
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:04,520
But this kid

194
00:08:04,520 --> 00:08:06,520
is a bit capable.

195
00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:08,520
He's a person.

196
00:08:08,520 --> 00:08:11,520
Since he's being reasonable,

197
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:13,520
then let's not fight.

198
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:16,520
But he's already hit the chief.

199
00:08:16,520 --> 00:08:18,520
He still has to be punished.

200
00:08:18,520 --> 00:08:20,520
From today onwards,

201
00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:22,520
all those who disobey the rules

202
00:08:22,520 --> 00:08:24,520
will be punished.

203
00:08:24,520 --> 00:08:26,520
Those who disobey the rules

204
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:28,520
will be punished.

205
00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:30,520
I will punish them severely.

206
00:08:30,520 --> 00:08:32,520
Here,

207
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:34,520
I am

208
00:08:34,520 --> 00:08:36,520
the one who's being punished.

209
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:41,520
Han Chuan.

210
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:43,520
Han Chuan!

211
00:08:48,520 --> 00:08:50,520
You're going out?

212
00:08:50,520 --> 00:08:52,520
You're going out to find Han Chuan?

213
00:08:52,520 --> 00:08:53,520
Master,

214
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:55,520
Hu Pei's death

215
00:08:55,520 --> 00:08:56,520
is the revenge and provocation

216
00:08:56,520 --> 00:08:58,520
of those criminals.

217
00:08:58,520 --> 00:09:00,520
So, you're going out to find Han Chuan?

218
00:09:00,520 --> 00:09:01,520
Yes.

219
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:02,520
Where are you going to find him?

220
00:09:02,520 --> 00:09:03,520
Dongbang.

221
00:09:03,520 --> 00:09:05,520
Dongbang has two provinces.

222
00:09:05,520 --> 00:09:07,520
Okay, even if you go out,

223
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:09,520
tell me how you're going to investigate.

224
00:09:09,520 --> 00:09:11,520
We don't have the right to enforce law.

225
00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:14,520
We don't have the location of the fraud group

226
00:09:14,520 --> 00:09:16,520
nor their personnel information.

227
00:09:16,520 --> 00:09:17,520
We don't know if we can investigate.

228
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:19,520
It's better than just waiting here.

229
00:09:19,520 --> 00:09:21,520
You think I'm willing to wait?

230
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:23,520
What we can do now

231
00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:24,520
is to wait for Han Chuan

232
00:09:24,520 --> 00:09:26,520
to give us further clues.

233
00:09:26,520 --> 00:09:29,520
We can find a way to contact him directly.

234
00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:30,520
You'll make trouble

235
00:09:30,520 --> 00:09:32,520
by doing such a blind action.

236
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:34,520
Hu Pei,

237
00:09:34,520 --> 00:09:36,520
you're a policeman.

238
00:09:36,520 --> 00:09:39,520
You have your responsibilities and discipline.

239
00:09:40,520 --> 00:09:41,520
Master, I...

240
00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:42,520
What do you mean by I?

241
00:09:42,520 --> 00:09:43,520
What you can do now

242
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:46,520
is to do your work well.

243
00:09:46,520 --> 00:09:47,520
You must pay close attention to the clues

244
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:48,520
Han Chuan gave you.

245
00:09:48,520 --> 00:09:49,520
Find a way to find out

246
00:09:49,520 --> 00:09:51,520
the organization's whereabouts.

247
00:09:51,520 --> 00:09:53,520
Do you understand?

248
00:09:53,520 --> 00:09:54,520
Yes.

249
00:09:54,520 --> 00:09:56,520
Sir.

250
00:09:56,520 --> 00:09:57,520
Captain An,

251
00:09:57,520 --> 00:09:58,520
there's something.

252
00:09:58,520 --> 00:10:00,520
Just tell me.

253
00:10:00,520 --> 00:10:02,520
Hu Pei's mother committed suicide.

254
00:10:02,520 --> 00:10:04,520
What?

255
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:05,520
Go and check

256
00:10:05,520 --> 00:10:06,520
what's going on at the scene.

257
00:10:06,520 --> 00:10:07,520
Report to me at any time.

258
00:10:07,520 --> 00:10:08,520
Yes.

259
00:10:16,520 --> 00:10:17,520
What's going on?

260
00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:18,520
I don't know who

261
00:10:18,520 --> 00:10:20,520
sent him the video of his daughter.

262
00:10:20,520 --> 00:10:21,520
It's a sin.

263
00:10:48,520 --> 00:10:49,520
Brother.

264
00:10:49,520 --> 00:10:50,520
Brother.

265
00:11:18,520 --> 00:11:19,520
Go.

266
00:11:45,520 --> 00:11:46,520
Go and report to me.

267
00:11:49,520 --> 00:11:50,520
Brother.

268
00:11:50,520 --> 00:11:51,520
If it doesn't work,

269
00:11:51,520 --> 00:11:52,520
let's go back to the canteen.

270
00:11:52,520 --> 00:11:55,520
What's wrong with the food?

271
00:11:55,520 --> 00:11:56,520
If we keep going like this,

272
00:11:56,520 --> 00:11:58,520
we'll kill ourselves sooner or later.

273
00:11:58,520 --> 00:11:59,520
We can't afford to cause trouble

274
00:11:59,520 --> 00:12:02,520
by doing such a blind action.

275
00:12:03,520 --> 00:12:05,520
Xing Lei,

276
00:12:05,520 --> 00:12:07,520
I want to rest for a while.

277
00:12:19,520 --> 00:12:20,520
I found Xiaoxiao.

278
00:12:20,520 --> 00:12:21,520
She's not in the building.

279
00:12:21,520 --> 00:12:23,520
She's not in the building.

280
00:12:23,520 --> 00:12:24,520
The Iron Buddha

281
00:12:24,520 --> 00:12:26,520
is very focused on the technical department.

282
00:12:26,520 --> 00:12:29,520
They're all arranged to the seventh floor.

283
00:12:29,520 --> 00:12:31,520
Xiaoxiao, wait for me.

284
00:12:31,520 --> 00:12:33,520
I'll take you there.

285
00:12:38,520 --> 00:12:39,520
Brother.

286
00:12:48,520 --> 00:12:49,520
Brother.

287
00:12:49,520 --> 00:12:51,520
Why is the watch here?

288
00:12:52,520 --> 00:12:53,520
I don't know.

289
00:12:53,520 --> 00:12:55,520
No, don't write it.

290
00:12:55,520 --> 00:12:57,520
Come on, I'll find something.

291
00:12:57,520 --> 00:12:58,520
What's this?

292
00:12:58,520 --> 00:13:00,520
I analyzed it.

293
00:13:00,520 --> 00:13:01,520
This time, Black Ghost

294
00:13:01,520 --> 00:13:04,520
is probably staring at Brother 13.

295
00:13:04,520 --> 00:13:05,520
Judging from his posture,

296
00:13:05,520 --> 00:13:07,520
he's probably going to kill Brother 13.

297
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:09,520
Rather than being beaten up,

298
00:13:09,520 --> 00:13:11,520
we'd better start over.

299
00:13:11,520 --> 00:13:13,520
You want to poison Black Ghost?

300
00:13:13,520 --> 00:13:15,520
This is a blood drug.

301
00:13:15,520 --> 00:13:16,520
It's not going to kill anyone.

302
00:13:16,520 --> 00:13:18,520
It can also let him know

303
00:13:18,520 --> 00:13:19,520
that there are many people

304
00:13:19,520 --> 00:13:20,520
watching him in our area.

305
00:13:20,520 --> 00:13:22,520
At least he will be careful

306
00:13:22,520 --> 00:13:24,520
and dare not make any more rash moves.

307
00:13:26,520 --> 00:13:28,520
Are you sure it won't go wrong?

308
00:13:28,520 --> 00:13:31,520
Can I hurt Brother 13?

309
00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:33,520
It's really the Black Ghost

310
00:13:33,520 --> 00:13:35,520
that's causing him trouble.

311
00:13:40,520 --> 00:13:41,520
Brother 13.

312
00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:43,520
I'm sorry.

313
00:13:43,520 --> 00:13:44,520
I'm sorry.

314
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:15,520
Brother, eat some.

315
00:14:19,520 --> 00:14:20,520
Brother Dong,

316
00:14:20,520 --> 00:14:22,520
your favorite spicy beef.

317
00:14:23,520 --> 00:14:25,520
You like it?

318
00:14:25,520 --> 00:14:27,520
Look.

319
00:14:27,520 --> 00:14:29,520
Look at this.

320
00:14:29,520 --> 00:14:31,520
You can't eat it.

321
00:14:33,520 --> 00:14:34,520
This...

322
00:14:34,520 --> 00:14:36,520
What is this?

323
00:14:36,520 --> 00:14:38,520
This is a piece of meat.

324
00:14:38,520 --> 00:14:40,520
This is a piece of meat.

325
00:14:40,520 --> 00:14:41,520
This...

326
00:14:41,520 --> 00:14:43,520
What is this?

327
00:14:43,520 --> 00:14:45,520
You want to make a light dish?

328
00:14:45,520 --> 00:14:47,520
Okay.

329
00:14:53,520 --> 00:14:55,520
Brothers, eat.

330
00:14:56,520 --> 00:14:58,520
You eat.

331
00:15:10,520 --> 00:15:12,520
You eat.

332
00:15:40,520 --> 00:15:42,520
Brother Dong.

333
00:15:44,520 --> 00:15:46,520
Where are the dishes?

334
00:15:46,520 --> 00:15:48,520
I've thought of a dish for you.

335
00:15:48,520 --> 00:15:49,520
It's especially suitable for you.

336
00:15:49,520 --> 00:15:50,520
But I don't have beef in the kitchen.

337
00:15:50,520 --> 00:15:52,520
I'll just use this dish.

338
00:15:52,520 --> 00:15:54,520
I promise it won't be spicy.

339
00:15:54,520 --> 00:15:55,520
Brother Dong,

340
00:15:55,520 --> 00:15:57,520
I'm sorry.

341
00:15:57,520 --> 00:15:59,520
I'm sorry.

342
00:15:59,520 --> 00:16:01,520
I'm sorry.

343
00:16:01,520 --> 00:16:03,520
I'm sorry.

344
00:16:03,520 --> 00:16:05,520
I'm sorry.

345
00:16:05,520 --> 00:16:07,520
I'm sorry.

346
00:16:07,520 --> 00:16:09,520
I'm sorry.

347
00:16:09,520 --> 00:16:11,520
It's not spicy.

348
00:16:17,520 --> 00:16:19,520
Go.

349
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:21,520
Thank you, Brother Dong.

350
00:16:39,520 --> 00:16:41,520
Hurry.

351
00:16:41,520 --> 00:16:43,520
What's going on?

352
00:16:43,520 --> 00:16:45,520
It's okay.

353
00:16:45,520 --> 00:16:47,520
Let me see.

354
00:16:47,520 --> 00:16:49,520
It's okay.

355
00:16:49,520 --> 00:16:51,520
Don't worry.

356
00:16:51,520 --> 00:16:53,520
Let me see.

357
00:16:53,520 --> 00:16:55,520
Doctor, he's dying.

358
00:16:55,520 --> 00:16:57,520
Hurry.

359
00:16:57,520 --> 00:16:59,520
Doctor, he's dying.

360
00:16:59,520 --> 00:17:01,520
He's dying.

361
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:03,520
He's dying.

362
00:17:03,520 --> 00:17:05,520
I'm sorry.

363
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:07,520
I'm sorry.

364
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:09,520
I'm sorry.

365
00:17:10,520 --> 00:17:12,520
It does not matter

366
00:17:12,520 --> 00:17:16,520
how the conflict between you is arranged.

367
00:17:16,520 --> 00:17:19,520
But if someone dies,

368
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:22,520
it will be different.

369
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:25,520
Whoever

370
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:27,520
stands up,

371
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:31,520
I can take action to save the life.

372
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:33,520
But if I find out,

373
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:35,520
he must die.

374
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:37,800
Keep our ties as friends.

375
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:12,520
Light up the road and set off

376
00:19:12,520 --> 00:19:19,520
I'm locked in the storm with you

377
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:26,520
Floating in the dust

378
00:19:26,520 --> 00:19:29,520
In the cold ice river

379
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:33,520
In the whirlpool

380
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:42,520
The dawn never falls
