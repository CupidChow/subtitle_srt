The King Of Blaze

00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Episode 16

3
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Six, three, nine, two...

4
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,000
What are you doing?

5
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
I'm just testing the horse.

6
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:29,000
I'm not sure what it is.

7
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
What are you doing?

8
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,000
What are you doing?

9
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,000
What?

10
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,000
What's wrong?

11
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,000
You're so low-key.

12
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,000
You won't let me talk?

13
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
What are you talking about?

14
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,000
I don't care what I say.

15
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,000
I'm just testing the horse.

16
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:48,000
I'm not sure what it is.

17
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,000
What are you doing?

18
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,000
What are you doing?

19
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,000
What are you doing?

20
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,000
What?

21
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Guys, let's do it!

22
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Let's do it!

23
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,000
What are you doing?

24
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,000
What are you doing?

25
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,000
What are you doing?

26
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Uncle Fu!

27
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Uncle Fu, come here.

28
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,000
It's so crowded again.

29
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,000
How's the race?

30
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Uncle Fu, he's ruining my plan.

31
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Uncle Fu, Dong and I are not good at this.

32
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,000
We're screwed.

33
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,000
He's making me lose.

34
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,000
You...

35
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Enough.

36
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,000
It's almost time.

37
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,000
An Fei,

38
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,000
I've got only this much time

39
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,000
to fight for you.

40
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Hello?

41
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,000
An Fei, I'm sorry, Ms. Hu.

42
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,000
I've got some problems.

43
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,000
My phone is out of power.

44
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Besides, the test horse just now

45
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,000
is out of power.

46
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
I'll send you another one.

47
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Okay.

48
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,000
It's...

49
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Six...

50
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Five...

51
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Hu Bei!

52
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
An Fei!

53
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Thank you.

54
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Remember,

55
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,000
if you want to test the horse,

56
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,000
I'll send you a short link

57
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,000
to make you wait.

58
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,000
I promise to give you a counter-attack

59
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
and make you join an investment group.

60
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
It's all fraud.

61
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,000
You can't trust me.

62
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Okay, I'll remember.

63
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
If you ever meet this kind of situation again,

64
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
you must call the police immediately.

65
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,000
I'll be there.

66
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
I'll be there.

67
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Got it?

68
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Okay, go back now.

69
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Officer!

70
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Anything else?

71
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Didn't you go to the school

72
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,000
to find me today?

73
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,000
I almost got cheated.

74
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Can you not let my classmates know?

75
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
This is not a good thing after all.

76
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
I don't want them to know.

77
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Okay, don't worry.

78
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Thank you.

79
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Oh, I almost forgot.

80
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,000
What is it?

81
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
You two go back first.

82
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,000
I'll go to the bank

83
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
and get Chen Lian and the others back.

84
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,000
What's wrong again?

85
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,000
What's wrong again?

86
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Pay the money for the delivery

87
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
to the people in the team.

88
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Captain An,

89
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,000
if you need our help,

90
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,000
just tell me.

91
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,000
I wonder how the team is doing now.

92
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Good job!

93
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Good job!

94
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Bro, good job!

95
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,000
You killed the black guy

96
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000
when I just got back.

97
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
You're so proud in front of the director.

98
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Good job!

99
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Although you don't make much money,

100
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
but you did it.

101
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Good job!

102
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Bro,

103
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
if you have any new wishes,

104
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
just tell me.

105
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Cheers!

106
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Okay, okay.

107
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Twoos!

108
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Touchdown tonight!

109
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:46,000
I was wrong, poisoned bastard!

110
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Hurt me!

111
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Bro!

112
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
This is my fault.

113
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
No need to title the blame.

114
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:56,060
I say, I'm Sailorна

115
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:57,560
They will be reborn next life

116
00:04:58,080 --> 00:04:59,920
but keep it a secret

117
00:04:59,940 --> 00:05:01,180
Pick up your hands

118
00:05:01,300 --> 00:05:05,220
You got it

119
00:05:05,300 --> 00:05:06,860
Dutiful

120
00:05:06,860 --> 00:05:12,440
Dutiful

121
00:05:15,220 --> 00:05:16,400
Not enough

122
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:18,460
Here comes the mentors

123
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:20,880
Big money willing

124
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:26,320
It's good enough that you can get the gift out of the prison

125
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,200
You can keep the gift

126
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:35,680
This is your dormitory

127
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:36,800
Go in

128
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:51,620
Hello

129
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:02,480
Hello

130
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:05,500
Is this yours?

131
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:21,720
I'm sorry.

132
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:24,800
I understand.

133
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:29,640
You understand?

134
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:34,360
You wouldn't dare to kill me.

135
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:37,840
You spent so much effort to trick me.

136
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:39,800
Isn't it because

137
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:41,720
your AI fraud software

138
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:43,840
was exposed to the police?

139
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:46,680
If you really kill me,

140
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:49,840
you can't explain it to your boss.

141
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:51,440
You're the one who got the award.

142
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:54,160
Although I won't kill you,

143
00:06:55,320 --> 00:06:56,600
I have a way

144
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:58,200
to make you die.

145
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:02,400
I can help you.

146
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:04,120
But you have to

147
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:05,960
send me and Li Bailing out safely.

148
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:07,800
If you don't agree,

149
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:09,520
it's up to you.

150
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:10,280
But you have to

151
00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:12,200
finish it within two months.

152
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:13,440
Otherwise,

153
00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:15,920
you and your classmate

154
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:17,840
will all die.

155
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:20,920
I'm sorry.

156
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:21,920
I didn't mean to.

157
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:22,520
They forced me.

158
00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:23,160
If I didn't listen,

159
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:24,080
they would have buried me.

160
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:24,880
Xiaoxiao!

161
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:26,520
Xiaoxiao!

162
00:07:30,280 --> 00:07:31,160
Xiaoxiao!

163
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:33,080
Xiaoxiao!

164
00:07:33,080 --> 00:07:34,320
Xiaoxiao, are you okay?

165
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:35,800
Stop pretending to be a good person here.

166
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:40,920
You tricked me into coming here.

167
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:43,280
And you didn't get anything.

168
00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:45,880
Xiaoxiao, I'm sorry.

169
00:07:45,880 --> 00:07:46,560
I didn't mean to.

170
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:47,080
They forced me.

171
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:47,720
If I didn't listen,

172
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:48,800
they would have buried me.

173
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:49,640
Xiaoxiao!

174
00:07:50,840 --> 00:07:51,680
Xiaoxiao!

175
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:15,400
Among billing with family «Y thing»

176
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:18,400
Among ah Tian

177
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:20,420
Try mine,

178
00:08:20,420 --> 00:08:21,660
take some,

179
00:08:21,660 --> 00:08:25,820
take

180
00:08:25,820 --> 00:08:28,220
No more friends?

181
00:08:28,220 --> 00:08:29,920
Your eyes are pretty good.

182
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:35,660
Show me your trick.

183
00:08:35,660 --> 00:08:39,980
Ok, continue.

184
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:41,700
Hello,יתnext 2019

185
00:08:41,860 --> 00:08:44,000
Hello this time.

186
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:48,200
See them, so pretty.

187
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:49,200
Hey

188
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:51,840
This is so good

189
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:53,120
You don't like it?

190
00:08:54,280 --> 00:08:56,560
You don't like it?

191
00:08:56,560 --> 00:08:58,720
I'll keep it if you don't want it

192
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:00,040
Okay, okay

193
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:01,280
Go to sleep

194
00:09:09,560 --> 00:09:10,560
Bro

195
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:12,480
What do you like?

196
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:15,560
What... what do you feel?

197
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:20,200
I'll go ahead

198
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:21,240
thanks

199
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:24,440
Only need you to come

200
00:09:24,680 --> 00:09:25,800
I'm a president

201
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:28,600
I just feel like being a president

202
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:30,960
That's why you keep cleaning

203
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:32,880
What gibberish

204
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:34,120
For people like you

205
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:35,520
who want to be a president

206
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:38,600
You should view après- phrasing

207
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:41,800
People who want to do something

208
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,560
Keep the foul

209
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:45,240
What is the problem?

210
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:46,240
Its shame

211
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:47,040
Good

212
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:50,080
The docs and medical technicians

213
00:09:50,900 --> 00:09:54,200
are in charge of technical matters.

214
00:09:55,820 --> 00:09:57,480
You'll be their guide in time.

215
00:09:57,480 --> 00:09:58,320
OK.

216
00:09:58,980 --> 00:10:01,160
You can ask me to work at the dock later.

217
00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:02,580
I have respect for you.

218
00:10:15,140 --> 00:10:15,640
OK.

219
00:10:15,640 --> 00:10:16,760
Come on.

220
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:17,720
Come on.

221
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:29,360
Hello, Brother 13.

222
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:30,840
Brother 13.

223
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,360
Hello, Brother 13.

224
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:32,920
No, Brother 13.

225
00:10:32,920 --> 00:10:33,840
This is the technical problem.

226
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:35,440
The technical problem is good.

227
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:37,640
No, I heard about it.

228
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:39,640
I didn't play it.

229
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:40,520
No, Brother 13.

230
00:10:40,520 --> 00:10:41,240
No, Brother 13.

231
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:41,880
No, Brother 13.

232
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:43,520
Xuan, listen to me.

233
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:44,760
Tell me the truth.

234
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:46,000
You made a contribution.

235
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,040
I have to sacrifice my life.

236
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:48,000
You...

237
00:10:48,920 --> 00:10:49,920
I can't.

238
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:50,920
Brother Hai, no.

239
00:10:50,920 --> 00:10:52,920
Brother Hai, listen to me.

240
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:54,640
I'm going to the park today.

241
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:55,960
You can play on the field.

242
00:10:55,960 --> 00:10:57,000
Well...

243
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:57,600
Come on.

244
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:58,800
What am I doing, Brother Hai?

245
00:10:59,000 --> 00:10:59,480
Brother Hai.

246
00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:00,520
Brother Hai.

247
00:11:00,520 --> 00:11:01,240
Brother Hai.

248
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:02,000
Brother Hai.

249
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:02,760
Brother Hai.

250
00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:03,680
Brother Hai.

251
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:04,680
Brother Hai.

252
00:11:04,680 --> 00:11:05,680
Brother Hai.

253
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:12,240
I don't know what my brother is thinking upstairs.

254
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:14,120
I didn't expect that

255
00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:15,920
Brother 13 is so good.

256
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:17,040
He won the Black Ghost Cave

257
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:18,040
when he first came upstairs.

258
00:11:18,040 --> 00:11:19,880
This time, he even showed his face to Buddha.

259
00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:20,880
Look at him.

260
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:23,520
Do you think it's a good thing?

261
00:11:23,520 --> 00:11:24,280
He's a newbie.

262
00:11:24,280 --> 00:11:25,320
He's so popular.

263
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:27,080
Now he offended the Black Ghost Cave.

264
00:11:27,080 --> 00:11:28,080
What's wrong with that?

265
00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:30,120
There's not only the Black Ghost Cave on the second floor.

266
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:31,120
Who's afraid of him?

267
00:11:31,280 --> 00:11:32,040
Wait.

268
00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:33,880
Zhang, what do you know?

269
00:11:33,880 --> 00:11:35,480
You just arrived.

270
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:36,240
Listen,

271
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:37,240
don't watch Ba Sihai

272
00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:38,040
always talking about it.

273
00:11:38,040 --> 00:11:39,240
He can't beat the Black Ghost Cave.

274
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:40,840
The Black Ghost Cave is very quiet.

275
00:11:40,840 --> 00:11:42,440
The Black Ghost Cave is very quiet.

276
00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:43,320
If he gets angry,

277
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:44,640
he'll use all the tricks

278
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:45,560
to beat you.

279
00:11:45,560 --> 00:11:48,440
That means we need to help Brother 13 more.

280
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:50,520
He didn't go upstairs when I called you.

281
00:11:50,520 --> 00:11:52,080
What's the use of going upstairs?

282
00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:53,800
Ba Sihai is still the 13th.

283
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:55,320
Can you stop him?

284
00:11:55,320 --> 00:11:56,480
I remind you.

285
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:58,080
The two team leaders on the second floor

286
00:11:58,080 --> 00:12:00,360
are both cruel and quiet.

287
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:01,880
If he gets angry,

288
00:12:01,880 --> 00:12:03,040
he'll have to help Brother 13

289
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:05,040
to keep an eye on him.

290
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:07,560
And I think

291
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:09,160
the Black Ghost Cave

292
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:11,200
will never be abandoned.

293
00:12:26,840 --> 00:12:27,480
I'm sorry.

294
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:28,720
Sorry.

295
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:29,600
I'll go win here.

296
00:12:39,160 --> 00:12:40,840
Do you still want to leave?

297
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:42,720
Not for five days.

298
00:12:43,520 --> 00:12:45,120
What's the matter?

299
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:59,960
He wants to kill

300
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:02,560
Das Volunteer G improve the power

301
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:05,400
to boost you especially.

302
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,240
Just right.

303
00:13:07,240 --> 00:13:08,000
No.

304
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:10,600
No thought you're here.

305
00:13:10,980 --> 00:13:11,660
Just a misses тутu.

306
00:13:12,020 --> 00:13:14,820
Yes, I'm not here to see him.

307
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:17,640
I've made up my mind.

308
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:21,180
Three of us are together.

309
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:23,060
Don't push us.

310
00:13:24,520 --> 00:13:25,700
At the vastness of beauty

311
00:13:25,740 --> 00:13:27,120
theё

312
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:28,880
So you've also decided to take this chance

313
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:30,300
to rely on me.

314
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:32,500
Look at it all now,

315
00:13:34,840 --> 00:13:37,000
you've been love-struck by his tattletale.

316
00:13:37,240 --> 00:13:38,160
I'll talk to you later.

317
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:42,000
I've found Xiao Xiao.

318
00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:56,440
Brother,

319
00:13:57,120 --> 00:13:59,360
be careful when you're on a mission.

320
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:00,560
Don't be so impulsive.

321
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,080
Be safe.

322
00:14:02,840 --> 00:14:03,440
And,

323
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:05,400
change your bad temper.

324
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:06,960
You always make people complain.

325
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:08,680
I know.

326
00:14:08,920 --> 00:14:10,360
You're getting more mature.

327
00:14:16,920 --> 00:14:17,480
What?

328
00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:26,200
Do you like it?

329
00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:28,160
It's okay.

330
00:14:29,480 --> 00:14:30,360
Listen,

331
00:14:30,680 --> 00:14:32,800
be careful when you're in Dongbang.

332
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:34,600
The security is better than the country.

333
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:36,040
Don't go out at night.

334
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:37,000
Got it?

335
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:38,960
Yes, sir.

336
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:43,280
I know.

337
00:14:43,280 --> 00:14:44,160
Where is she?

338
00:14:44,680 --> 00:14:45,480
How is she?

339
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:47,360
Don't worry.

340
00:14:47,880 --> 00:14:50,440
She's developing AI software in the technical department.

341
00:14:50,840 --> 00:14:51,960
It's heavily controlled.

342
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:54,040
I spent a long time

343
00:14:54,640 --> 00:14:55,680
to find her.

344
00:14:56,440 --> 00:14:57,400
But don't worry.

345
00:14:57,600 --> 00:14:58,800
She's safe now.

346
00:14:59,160 --> 00:15:00,200
Technical department?

347
00:15:00,920 --> 00:15:01,640
She's not in Liu Lou?

348
00:15:01,640 --> 00:15:02,480
She's not in Liu Lou.

349
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:06,480
Diefu values technical department.

350
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:09,040
They're on the seventh floor.

351
00:15:10,080 --> 00:15:13,000
The office and the accommodation are all up there.

352
00:15:14,120 --> 00:15:15,160
How's it going?

353
00:15:15,640 --> 00:15:17,800
I heard you defeated the Black Ghost.

354
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,960
I basically got the trust of the Wasei.

355
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:24,520
But I need some time to wait for her at the dock.

356
00:15:26,680 --> 00:15:27,720
It's going to be fast.

357
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:29,760
I don't know

358
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:31,400
how long

359
00:15:32,040 --> 00:15:33,280
I can hold on.

360
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:39,200
I'll take her away.

361
00:15:39,560 --> 00:15:41,400
She'll be found out if she comes out too late.

362
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:43,040
If there's any news,

363
00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:44,280
I'll go to you.

364
00:15:49,080 --> 00:15:50,280
You're in Liu Lou now?

365
00:16:01,720 --> 00:16:02,840
Don't go any further.

366
00:16:03,800 --> 00:16:05,480
The lady's room is up ahead.

367
00:16:05,480 --> 00:16:06,920
There's a security guard watching.

368
00:16:08,280 --> 00:16:09,200
What's your name?

369
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:14,200
Li Bailing.

370
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:38,600
Village Security Office

371
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:50,480
The Reformer

372
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:23,480
I'm afraid that you'll be too tired to sleep.

373
00:17:23,480 --> 00:17:24,480
I'll go to sleep.

374
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:25,480
I'll go to sleep.

375
00:17:25,480 --> 00:17:26,480
I'll go to sleep.

376
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:27,480
I'll go to sleep.

377
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:28,480
I'll go to sleep.

378
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:29,480
I'll go to sleep.

379
00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:30,480
I'll go to sleep.

380
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:31,480
I'll go to sleep.

381
00:17:31,480 --> 00:17:32,480
I'll go to sleep.

382
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:33,480
I'll go to sleep.

383
00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:34,480
I'll go to sleep.

384
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:35,480
I'll go to sleep.
