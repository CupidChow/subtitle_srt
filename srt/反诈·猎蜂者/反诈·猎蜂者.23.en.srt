00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
The Taoism Grandmaster

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Episode 16

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Taoism Grandmaster

4
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Captain An, Captain An, how are you?

5
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,000
Don't move.

6
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,000
The pulse is watching us.

7
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Cooperate with me.

8
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Send me to the hospital immediately.

9
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Then send out the news.

10
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Tell them that I'm badly injured.

11
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,000
I'm in danger.

12
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Understood.

13
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Captain An, you're really resourceful.

14
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
If we do this,

15
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Sang Tuo will definitely think that Captain An is seriously injured.

16
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
He won't bother us for the time being.

17
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
But I think this is still a dangerous matter.

18
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
If the cooperation is not good...

19
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,000
It won't.

20
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
My brother has been a partner of Captain An for seven or eight years.

21
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,000
I'm flattered.

22
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,000
The time I spent with my brother

23
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
is longer than the time he spent with him.

24
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Your brother will definitely understand my hint.

25
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Otherwise, with his character,

26
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
even if he dies, he won't be able to be a trigger.

27
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,000
But Sang Tuo is so ruthless.

28
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Did he really kill my brother?

29
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Don't worry.

30
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Your brother is smart.

31
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Nothing will happen.

32
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Oh, right.

33
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,000
I've already given your jade pendant to your brother.

34
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Sang Tuo probably won't be suspicious.

35
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
That's great.

36
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,000
I hope he can find out the secret of the jade pendant soon.

37
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Brother, look who I brought you.

38
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Brother.

39
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Da Xiong, sit.

40
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Before Da Xiong's family went bankrupt,

41
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,000
he was in charge of jade business.

42
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Let him show you.

43
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Really?

44
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,000
I was tricked this time.

45
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,000
They gave me a jade pendant.

46
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,000
I don't want to.

47
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Help me look at it.

48
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Sure.

49
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Let me see.

50
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Brother, who gave you this jade?

51
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Don't worry about who gave it to you.

52
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Just tell me the truth.

53
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Brother, this jade is fake.

54
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Look.

55
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:52,000
This is a jade pendant.

56
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
These two jades are put together.

57
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
But the craftsmanship is very high.

58
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Unless the old master

59
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:02,000
used a strong hand to see it from a certain angle,

60
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
it wouldn't be able to see it.

61
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
That's weird.

62
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Such a bad material and such a good craftsmanship.

63
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
It's not enough.

64
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Da An gave me a fake jade.

65
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Who?

66
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Da An gave you a fake jade?

67
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Don't tell me it's me.

68
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
I've never been here.

69
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
I've never seen any jade.

70
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
I have to go in now.

71
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Brother, it's so high.

72
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
These even raise the share price.

73
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Two jades are put together.

74
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
There's such a small world in here.

75
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
We have to find a way to get it.

76
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Such a small chip

77
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:58,000
needs a special interface and a computer.

78
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,000
But we have nothing.

79
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
What should we do?

80
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Brother, I'll figure it out.

81
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000
You?

82
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
You're the one who gave me the jade.

83
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
You?

84
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Sang Tuo was framed by the chief.

85
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
That's why the chief was investigated.

86
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
What's the point of saying this now?

87
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
I hope you can help us

88
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
to report Sang Tuo to the chief

89
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
about the secret of the boss in the back yard.

90
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Mr. An Fei, you're a Chinese police officer.

91
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
The one who was carried by Sang Tuo

92
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
even broke the house and the bridge.

93
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
And I, the chief's wife,

94
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
was also carried by them.

95
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
I even dared not go to the front yard.

96
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,000
That's why we can't let him

97
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,000
do this.

98
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
He's the chief.

99
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
He's given all the evidence.

100
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
I just hope

101
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:53,000
my children can grow up safely.

102
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
I don't want to offend

103
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
those people.

104
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
You're all scum.

105
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
You're all scum.

106
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,000
Clean it up.

107
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:15,000
You're so mean to your brothers.

108
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
Why are you all making instant noodles?

109
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
I'm not good at it.

110
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,000
I'm just doing it.

111
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
I know you're greedy.

112
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Look at this.

113
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
It's good.

114
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Brothers and sisters,

115
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
come on, take it.

116
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Come on.

117
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Eat it.

118
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,000
I brought you food.

119
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
It's good.

120
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,000
It's hot.

121
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Eat it.

122
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,000
You need to eat to have the energy to work.

123
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Come on.

124
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,000
Let's share it.

125
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Okay.

126
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
It's very good.

127
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Rui,

128
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,000
you're serious.

129
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
I'm also bragging to you.

130
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Of course, brother.

131
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,000
I told you

132
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,000
I'm a high-tech student.

133
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
I'm a top-notch talent.

134
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Don't underestimate me.

135
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Brother.

136
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
Your sister...

137
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000
What's wrong with my sister?

138
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
It's not easy to write a code

139
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
of this level.

140
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Your sister is a master.

141
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,000
She is very good at it.

142
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,000
She is a master.

143
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,000
I just want to say

144
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,000
that I'm very grateful to you.

145
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
But I'm also very grateful to you.

146
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
I'm a professional.

147
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,000
I can't do it.

148
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
I just want to say

149
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,000
that I'm a professional.

150
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,000
I'm a professional.

151
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,000
I'm a professional.

152
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
I just want to say

153
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,000
that I'm a master.

154
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,000
The chip in this jade pendant

155
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,000
is the key

156
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,000
to start the code program.

157
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,000
When she was forced

158
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,000
to develop the fraud program

159
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,000
in the salt field,

160
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,000
she secretly

161
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,000
inserted a code program

162
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,000
into the black box.

163
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,000
But she was rescued

164
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,000
before she could finish it.

165
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,000
Now what we have to do

166
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,000
is to connect this chip

167
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
to the black box

168
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
and start the code program.

169
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,000
Then we can

170
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
transfer all the data

171
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,000
in the black box

172
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,000
to the black box.

173
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Then we have to

174
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000
find a way

175
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,000
to connect the black box.

176
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,000
Brother,

177
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,000
how about this?

178
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,000
You can find a way to make a grave.

179
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,000
I'll go and start the code program.

180
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
No, it's too dangerous.

181
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,000
I'll go.

182
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,000
Brother,

183
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,000
this is not something

184
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,000
that can be done

185
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,000
by plugging in electricity.

186
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,000
You really can't do it.

187
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,000
Is there any news

188
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,000
from the wife

189
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,000
of Mr. Amy?

190
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
Except for a repair worker yesterday,

191
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,000
everything is normal.

192
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
She was at home all the time

193
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,000
and didn't go to the market.

194
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,000
She was scared by us.

195
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,000
Repair worker?

196
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,000
What repair worker?

197
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
An ordinary worker.

198
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,000
Her refrigerator is broken.

199
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,000
Did she call

200
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
outside yesterday?

201
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
According to our phone

202
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,000
identification,

203
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,000
no.

204
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,000
She didn't call.

205
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,000
She didn't call.

206
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,000
She didn't call.

207
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,000
She didn't call.

208
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,000
No.

209
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,000
Then how did she

210
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,000
call the repair worker?

211
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,000
Go and check it.

212
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,000
Come in.

213
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,000
Brother.

214
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,000
I know

215
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,000
my sister is not in your hands.

216
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,000
Go over there and have a drink.

217
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,000
Let's talk.

218
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
Go.

219
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,000
Brother.

220
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,000
How did you know

221
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
Xiaoxiao is not in my hand?

222
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
You are not in my hands.

223
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,000
I didn't know.

224
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,000
I know.

225
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,000
I know.

226
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,000
I know.

227
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,000
I don't know.

228
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,000
I don't know.

229
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,000
I don't know.

230
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:31,720
I know.

231
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:36,120
Cheers.

232
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:56,800
Here.

233
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:03,280
He and you won't get along

234
00:11:03,560 --> 00:11:05,160
and we will stay together.

235
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:19,560
Tell us what you want to say experience method.

236
00:11:22,280 --> 00:11:23,040
Apologize?

237
00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:28,280
We don't have

238
00:11:28,280 --> 00:11:29,840
to talk about anything else.

239
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,000
I'm sorry

240
00:11:43,560 --> 00:11:44,560
Shi

241
00:11:48,680 --> 00:11:49,840
I was 23 years old

242
00:11:51,160 --> 00:11:52,560
I was in the police force for half a year

243
00:11:53,520 --> 00:11:56,200
I was caught by a thief once

244
00:11:57,120 --> 00:11:58,440
The thief was 17 years old

245
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:00,440
He was thin and short

246
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,920
His eyes were bright and scary

247
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:04,280
He was a regular

248
00:12:05,280 --> 00:12:07,240
He stole a supermarket for a month

249
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:08,520
and was caught

250
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:11,320
He was so stupid

251
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:14,120
He could steal for a month in the same place

252
00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:18,000
When I arrived, he was already at the top of the building

253
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:19,080
He couldn't escape

254
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:21,200
He was standing on the side of the building

255
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,040
He had the money he stole

256
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:26,280
He said he didn't want to be caught

257
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:29,360
He'd rather die than go to jail

258
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:33,660
When he made that promise

259
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:34,960
He died

260
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:43,520
He was sentenced to ten years jail

261
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:49,360
I advised him

262
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:51,960
Then He took all the paper money

263
00:12:52,840 --> 00:12:53,920
in his hands

264
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:55,760
for a detail

265
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,680
He ran to catch the demon

266
00:12:58,680 --> 00:13:00,680
Only when a person is really dying

267
00:13:00,680 --> 00:13:03,680
will they be afraid and regretful.

268
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:07,680
So, in the end,

269
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:11,680
you dragged him back?

270
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:15,680
When I was pushing him over,

271
00:13:16,680 --> 00:13:18,680
his arm was broken.

272
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:21,680
I couldn't hold him,

273
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:23,680
and he couldn't climb up.

274
00:13:24,680 --> 00:13:26,680
When the snow fell,

275
00:13:26,680 --> 00:13:28,680
I couldn't hold him.

276
00:13:30,680 --> 00:13:32,680
After a few years, I often dreamed of him.

277
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:36,680
I dreamed of him asking me to save him.

278
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:39,680
I said he didn't want to die.

279
00:13:42,680 --> 00:13:44,680
He wasn't begging you.

280
00:13:46,680 --> 00:13:48,680
You were blaming yourself.

281
00:13:56,680 --> 00:13:57,680
I'm sorry.

282
00:13:57,680 --> 00:13:59,680
I'm sorry.

283
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:13,680
My brother has activated the program.

284
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:15,680
Slow down. Your foot.

285
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:21,680
My brother has broken the jade pendant's secret

286
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:22,680
and connected it to the black box.

287
00:14:22,680 --> 00:14:24,680
As long as my command is confirmed,

288
00:14:24,680 --> 00:14:25,680
the black box will automatically

289
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:27,680
transmit all the information in the black box.

290
00:14:34,680 --> 00:14:35,680
Qi,

291
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:36,680
help me pull the curtain up.

292
00:14:36,680 --> 00:14:37,680
I don't want any light.

293
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:38,680
Okay.

294
00:14:54,680 --> 00:14:55,680
Why did it take so long?

295
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:56,680
I have no choice.

296
00:14:56,680 --> 00:14:58,680
The file is too big.

297
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:00,680
In such a long time,

298
00:15:00,680 --> 00:15:02,680
Sang Tuo and Jian Biao will be back anytime.

299
00:15:02,680 --> 00:15:03,680
They are all ready.

300
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:05,680
How can we speed up?

301
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:06,680
We have it.

302
00:15:08,680 --> 00:15:09,680
No.

303
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:10,680
We need to accept the program

304
00:15:10,680 --> 00:15:12,680
and the room's colleagues.

305
00:15:12,680 --> 00:15:14,680
Can Han Xiao'ai understand?

306
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:18,680
Okay.

307
00:15:18,680 --> 00:15:19,680
I'll go.

308
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:20,680
I'll go.

309
00:15:20,680 --> 00:15:21,680
I'll go.

310
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:22,680
I'll go.

311
00:15:22,680 --> 00:15:23,680
I'll go.

312
00:15:24,680 --> 00:15:25,680
It's too late.

313
00:15:26,680 --> 00:15:27,680
Sima is satisfied.

314
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:34,680
Xiao Xiao,

315
00:15:34,680 --> 00:15:35,680
what's going on?

316
00:15:36,680 --> 00:15:37,680
What is he doing?

317
00:15:42,680 --> 00:15:43,680
Xiao Xiao,

318
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:44,680
you have to understand.

319
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:46,680
You have to understand everything.

320
00:15:46,680 --> 00:15:47,680
What's wrong?

321
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:49,680
This person has a new technology.

322
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:50,680
ZP high pressure lock.

323
00:15:50,680 --> 00:15:51,680
The original one-hour file

324
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:53,680
can only be transmitted in fifteen minutes.

325
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:55,680
But it needs my cooperation to accept it.

326
00:16:16,680 --> 00:16:17,680
Sorry, Sir.

327
00:16:20,680 --> 00:16:20,720
Luckily,

328
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:21,680
the agent manual is available to you.

329
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:31,460
Your

330
00:16:31,560 --> 00:16:32,680
departure is about fifty pennies to your summary.

331
00:16:32,680 --> 00:16:44,760
Sorry, Regarding the

332
00:16:44,760 --> 00:16:45,660
packed free recap!

333
00:16:45,660 --> 00:16:46,660
Thank you.

334
00:16:46,680 --> 00:16:47,920
He's a top-class master

335
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:49,440
Such a powerful man

336
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:50,720
was trapped in the court

337
00:16:51,160 --> 00:16:52,040
What a pity

338
00:16:52,280 --> 00:16:53,760
As long as the fate can be turned off

339
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:55,280
he will be free from trouble

340
00:16:57,960 --> 00:16:58,720
Sangde

341
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:01,400
I want to catch you

342
00:17:01,400 --> 00:17:02,800
not to let you go to jail

343
00:17:04,280 --> 00:17:05,240
You are still young

344
00:17:06,040 --> 00:17:07,000
and have a chance

345
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:08,160
Brother

346
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:11,360
If you are here today

347
00:17:11,360 --> 00:17:12,680
to persuade me to stop

348
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:15,360
then this wine

349
00:17:16,680 --> 00:17:18,560
I'd better stop
