The Taoism Grandmaster

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Episode 16

3
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Four minutes.

4
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:18,000
No.

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
If we don't finish the data in nine minutes,

6
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
the computer will start to do the protection.

7
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,000
The data will be stored.

8
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
It's not enough.

9
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
But how can we end it?

10
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,000
How about this?

11
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Let's just do it.

12
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Let's overclock the CPU.

13
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,000
But it will be easier to overheat.

14
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Whatever.

15
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Let's just try it.

16
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:55,000
The Taoism Grandmaster

17
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
The time is short again.

18
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,000
No.

19
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,000
There's something wrong.

20
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,000
What's wrong?

21
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,000
The CPU high-pressure speed is already the limit.

22
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
If we want to overclock it again,

23
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,000
unless the CPU is overclocked,

24
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,000
it's very dangerous.

25
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Once the CPU is overheated,

26
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
all the servers will be broken.

27
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Then the power will be out.

28
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:25,000
The Taoism Grandmaster

29
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:30,000
The Taoism Grandmaster

30
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
He must have used up too much time.

31
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,000
That's why I came up with this.

32
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,000
What should we do?

33
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,000
CPU overheating.

34
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
CPU overheating.

35
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Please, CPU overheating.

36
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Got it.

37
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,000
In that case,

38
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
let's do a fire and camp.

39
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:28,000
The Taoism Grandmaster

40
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Yes.

41
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Beautiful.

42
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
You know me too well.

43
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Double copy.

44
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,000
That's it.

45
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Okay.

46
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Next, give me some time.

47
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Just a little.

48
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:58,000
The Taoism Grandmaster

49
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:29,000
The Taoism Grandmaster

50
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:59,000
The Taoism Grandmaster

51
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:29,000
The Taoism Grandmaster

52
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:58,000
The Taoism Grandmaster

53
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Luo,

54
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
what do you want?

55
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
What did you say?

56
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Luo,

57
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
who told you to do this?

58
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
I told him to do it.

59
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Let him go.

60
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,000
You know what?

61
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
I've been waiting for this day for a long time.

62
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
I could have done nothing.

63
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
I'm not sure

64
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
because I'm not short of money.

65
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
I'm not short of your black money.

66
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
But

67
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
I saw every step you have taken

68
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
to get the gold and iron.

69
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
How many families have you lost?

70
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Seven miles of loss.

71
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
I can't even remember.

72
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,000
I only ask you,

73
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:06,000
who told you to do this?

74
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,000
I'm not asking.

75
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Why did I do this?

76
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,000
I'm telling you,

77
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
it's conscience.

78
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
It's the most innocent conscience.

79
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,000
Sang Zuo,

80
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,000
I'm not that useless

81
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
piece of shit you think I am.

82
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,000
Today,

83
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
I've lost my life

84
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
and this innocent life.

85
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
It's too late.

86
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Luo,

87
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,000
I'm sorry.

88
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Sang Zuo, Sang Zuo.

89
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Sang Zuo.

90
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,000
Sang Zuo.

91
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,000
Sang Zuo.

92
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:44,160
You are the unidentified seed in the fog

93
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:50,120
You know where to go and where to go

94
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:53,560
The light fades, the night is bright

95
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:56,920
The fireflies will shine

96
00:07:56,920 --> 00:08:01,160
Light up the road and drive away the snake

97
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:02,240
Brother

98
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:03,920
We've found out the identity of the repair worker

99
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:06,240
It's that Chinese police officer, An Fei

100
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:07,920
What?

101
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:10,320
He wants to get Amy out and deal with us

102
00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:12,080
But Amy's wife doesn't agree

103
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:17,400
Good

104
00:08:19,320 --> 00:08:22,280
What a sick man

105
00:08:22,280 --> 00:08:25,200
What a man

106
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:27,600
Don't worry, I'm in the hospital now

107
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:29,680
Everyone who arranged our people

108
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:32,080
An Fei will never escape

109
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:35,040
Arrange a final punishment for them

110
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:40,480
I want them to be punished

111
00:08:40,480 --> 00:08:41,360
Got it

112
00:08:56,920 --> 00:08:59,360
Ke'ai, Ke'ai, don't you dare

113
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:00,320
Yes

114
00:09:01,880 --> 00:09:03,880
Here are all the evidence of the fraud

115
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:05,360
I've prepared the score

116
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:06,520
OK

117
00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:09,280
Give all the data to the creative team

118
00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:09,960
Got it

119
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:11,720
Let's go and see Mrs. Amy

120
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:12,320
OK

121
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:28,600
We meet again, Officer Han

122
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:31,880
Come on

123
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:35,800
Be careful

124
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:37,120
Don't run

125
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:49,960
Madam, we got all the evidence of the funeral

126
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:51,480
It can prove that

127
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:54,000
he's the boss of the fraud in Hongyao City

128
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:02,480
Mrs. Amy

129
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:03,960
Mrs. Amy

130
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:05,720
On behalf of the team of the 118 Special Investigation Team

131
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:12,280
I ask you to give the evidence of the funeral to the mayor

132
00:10:12,280 --> 00:10:14,160
to save Mr. Amy

133
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:16,480
and our comrade Han Chuan

134
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:18,560
In that case

135
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:20,880
I'll go to see the chief and the killer

136
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:23,240
Thank you, madam

137
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:33,480
Brother

138
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:36,280
I'm so happy for you

139
00:10:39,080 --> 00:10:41,240
You actually set me up

140
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:46,520
The person I hate the most to betray me is

141
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:49,760
Han Chuan

142
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:53,480
I won't let you die like this

143
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:56,160
I won't let you die like this

144
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:58,200
I won't let you die like this

145
00:10:58,200 --> 00:11:00,560
I won't let you die like this

146
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:03,920
I won't let you die so happily

147
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:07,440
Sang Duo

148
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:11,240
You can't run away

149
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:12,600
I can't run away

150
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:17,280
Run, I can't run away

151
00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:32,440
Mr. host

152
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:33,680
I'm sorry

153
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:34,640
What's this?

154
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:35,560
Sm tok

155
00:11:35,560 --> 00:11:37,560
I prepared another marmalade

156
00:11:37,640 --> 00:11:39,240
bem

157
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:42,320
Wait

158
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:43,760
Wait

159
00:11:43,960 --> 00:11:44,960
What's wrong?

160
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:45,640
This

161
00:11:45,640 --> 00:11:46,800
I want anotherwen

162
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:48,320
I want two more

163
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:48,920
I'll get me another right

164
00:11:48,920 --> 00:11:51,040
Ok, I'll get you

165
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:56,560
Aman

166
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:01,560
Zha Li!

167
00:12:01,560 --> 00:12:02,560
Yes, sir!

168
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:04,560
What are you doing?

169
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:05,560
What are you doing?

170
00:12:05,560 --> 00:12:07,560
I'm going to kill you!

171
00:12:09,560 --> 00:12:10,560
Chief Amy,

172
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:11,560
that guy tried to escape from the window.

173
00:12:11,560 --> 00:12:12,560
I caught him.

174
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:15,560
This is a very tight situation.

175
00:12:15,560 --> 00:12:16,560
We can't let anyone get away with it.

176
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:18,560
You don't know, do you?

177
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:19,560
We have obtained all the evidence

178
00:12:19,560 --> 00:12:20,560
of Sang Tuo's fraud.

179
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:21,560
And the evidence of his?

180
00:12:21,560 --> 00:12:23,560
frame Chief Amy.

181
00:12:23,560 --> 00:12:24,560
Zha Li,

182
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:26,560
you killed the girl.

183
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:27,560
You can't let her go.

184
00:12:27,560 --> 00:12:28,560
Chief Amy,

185
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:29,560
we will attack three groups

186
00:12:29,560 --> 00:12:31,560
at the same time.

187
00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:32,560
The second group

188
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:34,560
will land at the dock,

189
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:35,560
attack the target,

190
00:12:35,560 --> 00:12:36,560
and take the target.

191
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:38,560
The key is to attract

192
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:40,560
all the firepower of the enemy.

193
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:41,560
Yes, sir!

194
00:12:41,560 --> 00:12:42,560
The B group,
