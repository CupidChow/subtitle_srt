00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Episode 16

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:13,000
The Taoism Grandmaster

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Come on, spread it out.

5
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Come on.

6
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,000
You guys, too.

7
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Come on.

8
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Come on.

9
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Let me introduce myself.

10
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,000
My name is Sang.

11
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,000
The person in the photo is my sister.

12
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Her name is Xiao Chuan.

13
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
I'm actually the same age as her.

14
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Her mother died early.

15
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,000
My parents didn't like her either.

16
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
We've been living together since we were little.

17
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Later, when my parents went out to work,

18
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
I stayed home alone.

19
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
I was in charge of taking care of her.

20
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Five years ago,

21
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,000
on her birthday,

22
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,000
she told me,

23
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,000
she said, brother, I want to eat a piece of cake.

24
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
She was very, very sensible.

25
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,000
She said,

26
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,000
brother,

27
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,000
I only want to eat one piece of cake.

28
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
I'll leave the rest to you.

29
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
The weather was really nice that day.

30
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
I was just using the cake's skills.

31
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
And then she died.

32
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Five years.

33
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
How did I find her?

34
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
You've taken care of so many children.

35
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Has anyone seen my sister?

36
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Everyone, think about it.

37
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Do you remember?

38
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Sang,

39
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,000
don't blame yourself too much.

40
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Let's work together.

41
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Don't worry.

42
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Your sister will definitely find her.

43
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Our children will also find her.

44
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
How about this?

45
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Let's cheer ourselves up.

46
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,000
I'll lead the way, okay?

47
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Come on.

48
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Come on.

49
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Work hard.

50
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Don't give up.

51
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Come on.

52
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Work hard.

53
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Don't give up.

54
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Come on.

55
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Work hard.

56
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Don't give up.

57
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Come on.

58
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Work hard.

59
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Don't give up.

60
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Come on.

61
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Work hard.

62
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Don't give up.

63
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Thank you, everyone.

64
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Well,

65
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
I know there's a website for children.

66
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
I don't know if you've heard of it.

67
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Han Chuan.

68
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
This is comrade Han Chuan.

69
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Hello, comrade.

70
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
My mom is coming with us.

71
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Master.

72
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Captain An.

73
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
There's a new clue of Sang Tuo in the East Branch.

74
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,000
What clue?

75
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
They caught a snake head.

76
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000
The man said

77
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
he sent a guest to China a while ago.

78
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
He only recognized the photo.

79
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
That guest is Sang Tuo.

80
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Did Nezha come back with him?

81
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
No clue so far.

82
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Sang Tuo

83
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
used all means to get the source.

84
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
If we get rid of him,

85
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
he won't give up easily.

86
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
We must find him as soon as possible.

87
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Yes.

88
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Hello, everyone.

89
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
My name is Zheng Jiahe.

90
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Look.

91
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
This is my son.

92
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,000
His name is Zheng Chenchen.

93
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
He's nine years old.

94
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
He passed away three years ago.

95
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
He has a square face,

96
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
a single eyelid and thick lips.

97
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Especially,

98
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:29,000
there's a tear in his right foot.

99
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
See?

100
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,000
See?

101
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
I hope that

102
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
the kind man

103
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,000
can contact me in time

104
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,000
if there's any clue.

105
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Thank you all for your help.

106
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Thank you.

107
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Look.

108
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Is it okay?

109
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
No problem.

110
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Sang.

111
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
We've recorded everything.

112
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Do you think

113
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
it's possible

114
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
to find the child

115
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
in this way?

116
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
As long as there's a chance,

117
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
we can't give up.

118
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Yes.

119
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,000
We won't give up.

120
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,000
We won't give up.

121
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,000
This software

122
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
is very slow to be tested online.

123
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
But it will definitely work.

124
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Please wait patiently.

125
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,000
I'll wait for you.

126
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
I'll wait for you.

127
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
I'll wait for you.

128
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,000
I'll wait for you.

129
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
I'll wait for you.

130
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Please wait patiently.

131
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Okay?

132
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Okay.

133
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Sang.

134
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Sang.

135
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000
You're here.

136
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
I'll let you come

137
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,000
when you're done.

138
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Can you come again?

139
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Sorry.

140
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,000
I'm sorry.

141
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
I'm sorry.

142
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,200
Hello, is this Ms. An Ning?

143
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:25,120
Yes, who are you?

144
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:27,160
I'm Han Chuan, the police officer of the Anti-Trap Center.

145
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:29,120
I need your cooperation in the investigation.

146
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:31,280
Cooperation in the investigation?

147
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:32,880
Are you on the phone?

148
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:34,480
The situation is quite special now.

149
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:35,720
Your husband Zheng Jiahe

150
00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:36,920
just brought a group of people

151
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:38,640
and the villagers of Anliu Village to the scene.

152
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:39,920
A fight?

153
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:41,160
What happened?

154
00:06:41,320 --> 00:06:42,400
He said he received a clue

155
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:43,360
that the man's child

156
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:44,800
had a conflict with the owner.

157
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:46,720
I happened to be doing anti-trap promotion nearby.

158
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:47,600
I met him.

159
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:49,320
I'm helping Ming Tian to find the culprit.

160
00:06:49,320 --> 00:06:50,480
You know the child,

161
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:51,280
right?

162
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:53,120
Did your husband Zheng Jiahe make a mistake?

163
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:54,000
Yes.

164
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:54,960
Come on.

165
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:06,960
Chenchen.

166
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:09,360
It's me, Chenchen.

167
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:12,400
Where are you?

168
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:14,160
I'm looking for you.

169
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:15,920
Han Chuan,

170
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:17,280
what's the situation?

171
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:18,680
I'm here to help you.

172
00:07:18,760 --> 00:07:20,560
Your situation is very complicated.

173
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:23,160
I can't make a precise judgment now.

174
00:07:23,320 --> 00:07:24,680
How to deal with the details?

175
00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:26,240
Wait for our message, okay?

176
00:07:31,320 --> 00:07:32,160
Captain An.

177
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:34,440
There's a phone call that I can't get through.

178
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:35,840
Send me the address.

179
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:37,600
Yao Yao, come with me to the top group.

180
00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:38,480
Yes.

181
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:39,520
Captain An.

182
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:40,720
I have a victim's phone here too.

183
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:41,760
I can't get through.

184
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:43,160
Captain An, I have one here too.

185
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:44,320
I have one here too.

186
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:46,800
Me too.

187
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:48,440
What's wrong with this place today?

188
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:50,960
So many bombings suddenly broke out.

189
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:53,040
It's very likely that it's a group bomb.

190
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:53,840
Yaqi.

191
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,920
Get the victim's social relations as soon as possible.

192
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:57,760
Contact the police in all districts.

193
00:07:57,920 --> 00:07:58,560
Go to the group.

194
00:07:58,720 --> 00:07:59,200
Yes.

195
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:00,320
All the police officers

196
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:01,920
keep calling the victim.

197
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:02,960
Yes.

198
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:07,320
My child.

199
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:08,280
My child.

200
00:08:08,440 --> 00:08:09,880
An Nishi, don't be agitated.

201
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:12,880
Are you sure this child is your child?

202
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:13,760
Is it?

203
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:15,320
It's my child.

204
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:17,360
How can I not know my own son?

205
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:18,840
Which village are you in?

206
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:19,680
I just said...

207
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:20,640
An Nishi.

208
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:22,200
It's no use for you to come now.

209
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:23,880
Calm down and listen to me.

210
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:25,040
According to the rules,

211
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:26,440
you can't file a case online.

212
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:27,840
But now the two sides are facing

213
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,480
a very serious problem.

214
00:08:29,640 --> 00:08:30,640
It can only be dealt with in a special way.

215
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:32,160
I need you to provide

216
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:34,160
ID and birth certificate as soon as possible.

217
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:36,280
I'll arrange for the personal identification.

218
00:08:36,920 --> 00:08:38,080
Okay, no problem.

219
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:38,760
Okay.

220
00:08:38,920 --> 00:08:40,000
I'll send you the small information

221
00:08:40,160 --> 00:08:41,200
of the internal sky newspaper now.

222
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:44,080
Captain An, the child is still in the front line.

223
00:08:47,640 --> 00:08:48,520
Get ready.

224
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:51,320
All hands ouf.

225
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:52,120
Exit the line!!

226
00:08:54,280 --> 00:08:55,120
blossoming

227
00:08:57,960 --> 00:08:58,960
remarks

228
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:04,880
Brother An.

229
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:07,400
這邊

230
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:10,180
Where is

231
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:11,880
brother An?

232
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:15,040
Now we are here.

233
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:16,280
Director,

234
00:09:16,280 --> 00:09:17,600
Don't believe it. It's a fraud call.

235
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:18,400
What are you doing?

236
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:19,760
Ms. An, listen to me.

237
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:20,640
It's a fraud call.

238
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:21,840
What fraud call?

239
00:09:23,280 --> 00:09:24,280
My child...

240
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:26,760
My child found me.

241
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:27,520
No.

242
00:09:27,520 --> 00:09:28,520
Ms. An, listen to me.

243
00:09:28,520 --> 00:09:30,120
You can't call this fraud.

244
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:30,920
Ms. An, listen to me.

245
00:09:30,920 --> 00:09:31,880
Don't stop me.

246
00:09:31,880 --> 00:09:32,600
Ms. An.

247
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:34,840
But this call...

248
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:39,240
I think it's really a fraud call.

249
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:43,560
You...

250
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,000
You...

251
00:09:46,280 --> 00:09:47,280
You...

252
00:09:51,160 --> 00:09:53,160
Listen to me.

253
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:56,360
Ms. An, that's a fraud call.

254
00:09:56,360 --> 00:09:57,200
That's not your son.

255
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:58,520
It's a fraud call.

256
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:11,440
Call Ye Qi.

257
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:12,600
Call him. Hurry.

258
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:14,760
I got it.

259
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:15,480
Good.

260
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:16,600
Good, my friend.

261
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:18,360
Good.

262
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:19,000
Mr. Wu.

263
00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:20,480
I've checked it.

264
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:21,400
The frauds today

265
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:23,800
are all the family members of the same Xunzi protection group.

266
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:25,280
They just had a gathering today.

267
00:10:25,280 --> 00:10:26,960
It's in the new yard, Nongjiale.

268
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:28,640
But all the people who attended the gathering today

269
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:29,640
couldn't contact them.

270
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:34,320
One team.

271
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:35,680
Yes.

272
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:37,680
Go to the new yard, Nongjiale.

273
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:38,120
Go.

274
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:39,120
Yes.

275
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:44,320
Master.

276
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:46,400
I'll go check it out.

277
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:49,600
Just check it out.

278
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:50,880
Don't interfere.

279
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:51,640
Yes.

280
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,040
We'll drink with tea.

281
00:10:54,040 --> 00:10:55,040
Thank you, Sang.

282
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:56,240
We have another chance

283
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:57,280
to find the child.

284
00:10:57,280 --> 00:10:57,800
Thank you.

285
00:10:57,800 --> 00:10:58,960
I'm so embarrassed.

286
00:10:58,960 --> 00:10:59,520
It's okay.

287
00:10:59,520 --> 00:11:00,360
Come on, thank you.

288
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:06,760
I'll answer the phone.

289
00:11:06,760 --> 00:11:07,600
You guys continue.

290
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:10,440
Don't worry.

291
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:11,400
Wait a little longer.

292
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:16,760
Hello.

293
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:18,080
Sang.

294
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:19,600
We've got it.

295
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:21,000
What?

296
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,200
My sister has found it.

297
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:25,480
Her sister has found it.

298
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:27,240
It's a good thing for us.

299
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:28,440
Maybe our child

300
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:29,240
can find it, too.

301
00:11:29,240 --> 00:11:29,800
Right?

302
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:31,720
At least we have a hope.

303
00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:32,360
Right?

304
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:33,960
Okay.

305
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:35,280
Don't move.

306
00:11:35,280 --> 00:11:35,880
Send me the address.

307
00:11:35,880 --> 00:11:36,960
I'll go there next week.

308
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:38,000
Thank you.

309
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:38,760
Thank you very much.

310
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:41,440
I found it.

311
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:42,360
You found it?

312
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:43,880
My sister found it.

313
00:11:43,880 --> 00:11:44,600
Congratulations.

314
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:45,920
Thank you.

315
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:47,000
Congratulations.

316
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,160
I don't know what to say.

317
00:11:49,160 --> 00:11:50,040
Don't say anything.

318
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:51,720
Go.

319
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:53,320
Okay.

320
00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:54,360
I'll go now.

321
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:55,360
Okay.

322
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:56,160
Take care.

323
00:11:58,920 --> 00:12:01,120
You'll find it.

324
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:02,000
I'll go now.

325
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:03,280
Okay.

326
00:12:03,280 --> 00:12:04,600
Go.

327
00:12:09,280 --> 00:12:10,680
Hello, wife.

328
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,120
Impossible.

329
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:14,240
The money is missing.

330
00:12:15,160 --> 00:12:16,480
What?

331
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:17,960
I found the money for the child.

332
00:12:17,960 --> 00:12:19,240
What's going on?

333
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:20,760
What's going on?

334
00:12:20,760 --> 00:12:21,760
What's going on?

335
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:22,600
What's going on?

336
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:23,240
What's going on?

337
00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:24,480
What's going on?

338
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:45,840
Who are you?

339
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:16,240
The case of Xun Zi Xun's fraud case

340
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:18,240
only paid three families.

341
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:19,440
The other 12 families

342
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:21,440
suffered different economic losses.

343
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:23,240
The total is 2.1 million yuan.

344
00:13:23,240 --> 00:13:24,600
We've checked it.

345
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:34,800
The main

346
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:36,240
and secondary families

347
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:37,840
suffered the same amount of loss.

348
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:39,560
The total is 2.1 million yuan.

349
00:13:39,560 --> 00:13:41,040
The main and secondary families

350
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:42,440
suffered the same amount of loss.

351
00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:43,640
The main and secondary families

352
00:13:43,640 --> 00:13:45,040
suffered the same amount of loss.

353
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:45,840
This time,

354
00:13:45,840 --> 00:13:47,240
he pretended to be Han Chuan

355
00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:48,240
and made a fraud.

356
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:50,240
It's obviously a revenge.

357
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:53,840
How are the people in the case?

358
00:13:53,840 --> 00:13:55,240
They're all very emotional.

359
00:13:55,240 --> 00:13:56,840
They don't listen to any explanation.

360
00:13:57,440 --> 00:13:58,440
And...

361
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:02,040
And what?

362
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:05,240
They also let us severely punish Han Chuan.

363
00:14:09,840 --> 00:14:12,240
We should try to calm down everyone's emotions

364
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:13,840
and avoid causing a mass incident.

365
00:14:13,840 --> 00:14:14,640
Yes.

366
00:14:14,640 --> 00:14:17,240
Did Sang Tuo find any new clues?

367
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:19,440
When we rushed to the restaurant,

368
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:21,240
we happened to bump into him.

369
00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:22,840
I chased him for a while.

370
00:14:22,840 --> 00:14:25,240
I chased him off at a crossroads.

371
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:27,240
He has a strong sense of anti-scan.

372
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:29,840
We compared the fingerprints of all the members of the参与集会

373
00:14:29,840 --> 00:14:31,640
and found that there was no him.

374
00:14:31,640 --> 00:14:33,240
All the victims of the参与集会

375
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:34,640
were also only Zheng Jiahe

376
00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:35,440
and Sang Tuo.

377
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:37,040
It wasn't the first time they met.

378
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:38,840
Zheng Jiahe's information about Sang Tuo

379
00:14:38,840 --> 00:14:40,640
was also fake.

380
00:14:41,240 --> 00:14:43,040
The surveillance around him is being investigated.

381
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:44,240
The wanted list has also been sent down.

382
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:46,040
There are no other new information yet.

383
00:14:46,840 --> 00:14:48,840
Then Sang Tuo is very cunning.

384
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:51,840
Han Chuan,

385
00:14:51,840 --> 00:14:54,640
this time, you will enter the case as a normal person
