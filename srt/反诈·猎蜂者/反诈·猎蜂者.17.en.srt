00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
The King of Blaze

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Episode 16

3
00:00:21,400 --> 00:00:25,800
Brother, how long are you going to keep quiet like this?

4
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:27,320
You've been acquitted?

5
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:28,340
Okay, let's get out of here.

6
00:00:28,360 --> 00:00:28,780
Yes.

7
00:00:33,160 --> 00:00:33,520
rait Chief Sang.

8
00:00:33,560 --> 00:00:35,320
Sister, are you on the sixth floor?

9
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:48,300
I guess you want to find this elevator card.

10
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:50,520
But the day after tomorrow, you'll take your sister

11
00:00:50,540 --> 00:00:52,400
and go out with Li Bailing, right?

12
00:00:54,680 --> 00:00:55,600
You know it all.

13
00:00:55,800 --> 00:00:58,240
to see if you can get out of here successfully.

14
00:00:59,360 --> 00:01:00,200
What do you mean?

15
00:01:01,240 --> 00:01:03,560
You can leave by using the elevator.

16
00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:07,840
But this building has 127 people inside and outside.

17
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:11,720
You have to be the leader of Luo Liao Group.

18
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:13,920
Brother,

19
00:01:14,440 --> 00:01:15,520
let me ask you.

20
00:01:16,160 --> 00:01:18,720
Am I wrong to be the leader?

21
00:01:21,320 --> 00:01:23,240
I knew about your sister's matter this afternoon.

22
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:25,920
I arranged the best medicine for her.

23
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:28,080
The fever has gone down.

24
00:01:28,360 --> 00:01:29,320
She survived.

25
00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:30,480
Brother,

26
00:01:31,160 --> 00:01:32,040
let me ask you again.

27
00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:35,240
Am I wrong to be the leader?

28
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:41,720
I knew you wanted to steal the boat.

29
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:43,240
You came to me

30
00:01:43,480 --> 00:01:45,960
because you wanted me to help you take your sister out.

31
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:48,920
You have no other choice.

32
00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:51,160
Among the three leaders,

33
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:54,320
I'm the only one who can help you.

34
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:55,600
Brother,

35
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:57,720
let me ask you again.

36
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:00,760
Am I wrong to be the leader?

37
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:01,600
You're wrong.

38
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:13,400
Song Duo,

39
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:16,600
I don't take you as my brother.

40
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,400
I said I would save you.

41
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:23,240
But I don't want you to be more than a dozen years old

42
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:25,480
because you're the leader.

43
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:28,560
So I think it has nothing to do with you

44
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:31,120
helping me or not.

45
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:36,800
Brother,

46
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:38,840
I'm still the first person

47
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:41,200
who cares about me being in jail

48
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:42,320
after I've grown up.

49
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:47,000
Actually, I'll help you

50
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:48,720
if you don't come to me today.

51
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:50,920
But I want to tell you

52
00:02:51,320 --> 00:02:52,880
that your plan to steal the boat is different.

53
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:54,640
Why?

54
00:02:55,160 --> 00:02:57,400
I found out after I became the leader

55
00:02:58,040 --> 00:02:59,160
that the boat that transports the pigs

56
00:02:59,160 --> 00:03:01,240
won't stop at the dock every now and then.

57
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:02,760
Once the boat is checked,

58
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:04,440
it will leave after there is no problem.

59
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:07,360
It will come back to the dock the next night.

60
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:09,040
But it stops for a very short time.

61
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:10,640
It will leave as soon as it reaches the sea.

62
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:11,880
And the neighbors on the shore

63
00:03:11,880 --> 00:03:12,880
are also watching it.

64
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:16,280
You have to take two daughters with you.

65
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:17,640
You can't steal the boat at all.

66
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:19,280
The boat

67
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:21,360
is waiting for Basi Sea alone?

68
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:22,800
Yes.

69
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:25,480
You have to lure Basi Sea away

70
00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:27,880
to make the boat stop for a long time.

71
00:03:27,880 --> 00:03:28,720
By then,

72
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:29,840
I'll help you find a way

73
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:31,320
to solve the internal trouble of the dock.

74
00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:32,800
Then you'll have a chance to get on the boat.

75
00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:37,960
Lure Basi Sea away?

76
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:46,000
The ship is in a hurry now.

77
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:48,280
The ship is in a hurry now.

78
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:50,000
It's like a scolding.

79
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:50,920
At this time,

80
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:52,440
we have to

81
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:54,040
unite.

82
00:03:55,640 --> 00:03:57,840
Now is not the time to scold me for stealing the boat.

83
00:03:59,200 --> 00:03:59,960
There are many people.

84
00:03:59,960 --> 00:04:01,200
There are many people.

85
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:03,880
Don't be too serious.

86
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:07,880
I have an idea.

87
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:09,880
Basi Sea and Nezha

88
00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:11,440
look different on the surface.

89
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:12,880
But Basi Sea

90
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:14,440
has been based on Nezha's beauty.

91
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:16,400
My plan is

92
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:18,440
to use Nezha

93
00:04:18,640 --> 00:04:20,400
to delay the production of Basi Sea.

94
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:22,920
Zha Jie.

95
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:25,880
You've worked hard to build the water mill these days.

96
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:28,680
I made you a delicious meal at noon.

97
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:30,120
The day after tomorrow night,

98
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:31,840
Basi Sea will definitely go to the floating area.

99
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:33,560
I'll go to the dock to get the boat.

100
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:35,080
Zang Duo.

101
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:37,600
Help me take Xiaoxiao and Li Bailing

102
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:38,440
to the dock.

103
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:41,040
Okay.

104
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:44,920
Okay.

105
00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:03,620
Agree.

106
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:05,400
For having offended me,

107
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:06,840
came to say sorry?

108
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:11,800
Your apology doesn't feel sincere,

109
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:13,160
what for the deck?

110
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:14,120
Take it.

111
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:15,440
Hello?

112
00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:39,720
What're you doing?

113
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:41,600
Someone asked me to send you a gift.

114
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:43,680
Haven't you shared your pork belly earlier?

115
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:46,120
It's finally here.

116
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:48,680
Let me get this message for you.

117
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:50,560
What happened?

118
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:52,640
Why are you so forthright?

119
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:55,080
I don't know why I didn't show up.

120
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:56,560
I was 오늘은

121
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:57,600
What?

122
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:01,160
I'm saying that I'm happy that I came.

123
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:01,960
Dad, don't be like that.

124
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:04,360
But I was thinking,

125
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:06,280
I'm gonna complain

126
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:07,560
If I could,

127
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:09,920
It would be very desperate.

128
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:11,920
I like it.

129
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:16,920
Like it.

130
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:18,920
Like it.

131
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:42,920
I like it.

132
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:08,920
It seems quite shocking.

133
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:10,920
It's quite funny.

134
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:31,920
This thing was sent by the person who stole the noodles last time.

135
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:33,920
It's still not convenient to steal.

136
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:10,920
I'm not sure if it's a good idea to steal.

137
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:12,920
I'm not sure if it's a good idea to steal.

138
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:14,920
I'm not sure if it's a good idea to steal.

139
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:16,920
I'm not sure if it's a good idea to steal.

140
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:18,920
I'm not sure if it's a good idea to steal.

141
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:20,920
I'm not sure if it's a good idea to steal.

142
00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:22,920
I'm not sure if it's a good idea to steal.

143
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:24,920
I'm not sure if it's a good idea to steal.

144
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:26,920
I'm not sure if it's a good idea to steal.

145
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:28,920
I'm not sure if it's a good idea to steal.

146
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:30,920
I'm not sure if it's a good idea to steal.

147
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:32,920
I'm not sure if it's a good idea to steal.

148
00:08:32,920 --> 00:08:34,920
I'm not sure if it's a good idea to steal.

149
00:08:34,920 --> 00:08:36,920
I'm not sure if it's a good idea to steal.

150
00:08:36,920 --> 00:08:38,920
I'm not sure if it's a good idea to steal.

151
00:08:40,920 --> 00:08:42,920
I'm not sure if it's a good idea to steal.

152
00:08:44,920 --> 00:08:46,920
It's also saving girls,

153
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:48,920
it's also saving girls,

154
00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:50,920
it's also saving girls.

155
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:57,920
That's why I'm

156
00:08:57,920 --> 00:08:59,920
that's why I'm balancing the filming time at zero.

157
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:01,920
that's why I'm balancing the filming time at zero.

158
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:02,140
So I do all

159
00:09:02,140 --> 00:09:03,140
So I do all those work for��s

160
00:09:03,140 --> 00:09:05,140
all those work for сторcings.

161
00:09:35,140 --> 00:09:37,660
I can see you are a great agent

162
00:09:37,660 --> 00:10:01,440
to

163
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:33,500
To push soar.

164
00:10:54,340 --> 00:10:55,580
Brother Hai.

165
00:10:59,460 --> 00:11:00,640
Brother Hai?

166
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:26,260
The

167
00:11:26,260 --> 00:11:27,100
I'm sorry.

168
00:11:35,100 --> 00:11:35,980
We're here, Xiaoxiao.

169
00:11:36,340 --> 00:11:37,100
Hang in there.

170
00:11:40,980 --> 00:11:41,620
Xiaoxiao.

171
00:11:42,220 --> 00:11:42,940
Brother.

172
00:11:44,940 --> 00:11:45,580
Xiaoxiao.

173
00:11:53,700 --> 00:11:54,500
Get on the boat first.

174
00:11:56,260 --> 00:11:56,900
Let's go.

175
00:11:58,740 --> 00:11:59,460
Where's Sang Nong?

176
00:11:59,780 --> 00:12:00,660
He sent us back

177
00:12:00,660 --> 00:12:01,540
after he sent us down.

178
00:12:01,700 --> 00:12:02,860
He said it's important.

179
00:12:04,140 --> 00:12:05,180
What's the matter?

180
00:12:26,260 --> 00:12:26,940
So nice.

181
00:12:26,940 --> 00:12:29,780
Your whole life...

182
00:12:29,780 --> 00:12:31,420
is not important.

183
00:12:45,420 --> 00:12:46,140
All right.

184
00:12:46,140 --> 00:12:52,140
I'll make sure you get a good beating tonight.

185
00:12:57,140 --> 00:12:59,140
Why are you so late?

186
00:13:00,140 --> 00:13:02,140
Say something!

187
00:13:06,140 --> 00:13:08,140
You look quite serious.

188
00:13:08,140 --> 00:13:10,140
You're quite bad at this.

189
00:13:11,140 --> 00:13:18,140
I'll make sure you get a good beating tonight.

190
00:13:18,140 --> 00:13:20,140
What are you doing?

191
00:13:22,140 --> 00:13:24,140
Did you hear that?

192
00:13:24,140 --> 00:13:26,140
It's Basi and Zhajue.

193
00:13:26,140 --> 00:13:28,140
I heard it.

194
00:13:29,140 --> 00:13:31,140
It's them.

195
00:13:32,140 --> 00:13:35,140
Louder! Louder!

196
00:13:35,140 --> 00:13:37,140
The more you shout, the more I like it.

197
00:13:38,140 --> 00:13:40,140
You scared me to death!

198
00:13:40,140 --> 00:13:42,140
You're so mean!

199
00:13:47,140 --> 00:13:48,140
Why did you stop?

200
00:13:48,140 --> 00:13:49,140
Continue.

201
00:13:49,140 --> 00:13:52,140
Uncle Bo, I don't know.

202
00:13:53,140 --> 00:13:55,140
Uncle Bo, listen to me.

203
00:13:55,140 --> 00:13:56,140
Shut up.

204
00:13:57,140 --> 00:14:00,140
Uncle Bo, he seduced me.

205
00:14:01,140 --> 00:14:03,140
I didn't let him in.

206
00:14:03,140 --> 00:14:05,140
I was afraid he would try to seduce me.

207
00:14:05,140 --> 00:14:06,140
I...

208
00:14:06,140 --> 00:14:10,140
Hai, you've been with me for so many years.

209
00:14:10,140 --> 00:14:13,140
If you like him, tell me.

210
00:14:13,140 --> 00:14:15,140
It's okay.

211
00:14:15,140 --> 00:14:16,140
It's okay.

212
00:14:17,140 --> 00:14:19,140
I'm wrong.

213
00:14:19,140 --> 00:14:21,140
I'm begging you.

214
00:14:21,140 --> 00:14:23,140
We're brothers.

215
00:14:23,140 --> 00:14:26,140
If you want him, I'll give him to you.

216
00:14:26,140 --> 00:14:28,140
You don't have to be so secretive.

217
00:14:28,140 --> 00:14:29,140
No.

218
00:14:31,140 --> 00:14:34,140
What? You don't want him anymore?

219
00:14:36,140 --> 00:14:37,140
No.

220
00:14:38,140 --> 00:14:39,140
No.

221
00:14:39,140 --> 00:14:40,140
Get up.

222
00:14:41,140 --> 00:14:42,140
That's it.

223
00:14:42,140 --> 00:14:44,140
Go home and rest.

224
00:14:44,140 --> 00:14:46,140
You have to work tomorrow.

225
00:14:49,140 --> 00:14:50,140
What?

226
00:14:51,140 --> 00:14:53,140
You're not satisfied with my result?

227
00:14:53,140 --> 00:14:54,140
No, no, no.

228
00:14:54,140 --> 00:14:56,140
I'm satisfied.

229
00:14:56,140 --> 00:14:58,140
Uncle Bo, uncle Bo.

230
00:15:05,140 --> 00:15:06,140
Uncle Bo.

231
00:15:27,140 --> 00:15:28,140
Uncle Bo, bad news.

232
00:15:28,140 --> 00:15:29,140
