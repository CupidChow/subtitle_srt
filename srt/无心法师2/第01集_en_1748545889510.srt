1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
The snow floating in the clouds

2
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,400
The sky you love

3
00:00:36,400 --> 00:00:40,000
Like a pigeon flying

4
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:46,000
The white hair is engraved on those two names

5
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,560
They are like hair

6
00:00:48,560 --> 00:00:52,000
Love is forever

7
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,240
The sky is still shadowy

8
00:00:54,240 --> 00:00:58,000
The sky is still full of pigeons flying

9
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Who is to prove that

10
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,000
The unspoken love and life

11
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,400
The snow is still falling

12
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:10,000
The village is still safe

13
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,640
Young people

14
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:16,000
Disappeared in the white flower field

15
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:20,000
When they died

16
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
They said

17
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,800
I came waiting for me

18
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:28,800
In the white flower field

19
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:42,800
Episode 1

20
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:56,800
Episode 2

21
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:26,800
Episode 3

22
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:56,800
Episode 4

23
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:28,560
Drowning

24
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:33,120
Wu Xin, get up.

25
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:35,440
See that I made your favorite pork stew.

26
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:37,200
Get up slowly, okay?

27
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Wu Xin, what time is it?

28
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,360
You are still sleeping?

29
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:45,120
Get up.

30
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:48,000
It's getting cold. Get up.

31
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,080
Get up.

32
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:57,000
Let them see my face!

33
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,460
about what happened behindöllie.

34
00:04:02,580 --> 00:04:05,380
You have the purest tickets and it caught my attention.

35
00:04:05,380 --> 00:04:08,500
It' s time to get back to the red Europe for Ye langue.

36
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:13,400
Do you韻yi know Kitty yet?

37
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:15,760
Remember the business representative Pavilion Li Li?

38
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:17,800
What's more important is Shi Qing?

39
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:19,160
You also need to think too much.

40
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:19,960
We need to think responsibly.

41
00:04:19,960 --> 00:04:21,200
Ex awakened a lot of people.

42
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:22,680
EvenACiD said you had established the Product M steamer

43
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:23,900
to the port of An ename.

44
00:04:23,900 --> 00:04:25,480
I couldn´t convince that murky.

45
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:26,520
Get up quickly.

46
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:27,240
I'm not afraid of her.

47
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:28,720
Someone in my dream

48
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:29,400
made me a meal

49
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:30,680
and called me to get up.

50
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:31,920
I have to take care of you.

51
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:34,480
The counterattack is too big.

52
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:35,640
If the gap is not big,

53
00:04:35,640 --> 00:04:36,800
then don't call it a dream.

54
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:38,840
Get up quickly.

55
00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:44,000
You're going to the far door today, right?

56
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:46,920
Go report to the police.

57
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:47,960
You go.

58
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:49,240
Go.

59
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:51,400
It's boring anyway.

60
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:58,780
When I was any younger

61
00:04:58,780 --> 00:05:22,700
I mapped out

62
00:05:22,700 --> 00:05:24,060
such a good story.

63
00:05:24,060 --> 00:05:26,060
I'm not afraid of the wind.

64
00:05:26,060 --> 00:05:28,060
I'm afraid of the wind.

65
00:05:28,060 --> 00:05:30,060
I'm afraid of the wind.

66
00:05:30,060 --> 00:05:32,060
I'm afraid of the wind.

67
00:05:32,060 --> 00:05:34,060
I'm afraid of the wind.

68
00:05:34,060 --> 00:05:36,060
I'm afraid of the wind.

69
00:05:36,060 --> 00:05:38,060
I'm afraid of the wind.

70
00:05:38,060 --> 00:05:40,060
I'm afraid of the wind.

71
00:05:40,060 --> 00:05:42,060
I'm afraid of the wind.

72
00:05:42,060 --> 00:05:44,060
I'm afraid of the wind.

73
00:05:44,060 --> 00:05:46,060
I'm afraid of the wind.

74
00:05:46,060 --> 00:05:48,060
I'm afraid of the wind.

75
00:05:48,060 --> 00:05:50,060
I'm afraid of the wind.

76
00:05:50,060 --> 00:05:52,060
I'm afraid of the wind.

77
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:54,500
The vale of fame.

78
00:05:56,060 --> 00:05:59,400
파견

79
00:06:06,060 --> 00:06:08,060
A qualified,

80
00:06:08,060 --> 00:06:09,060
who is as little as the first,

81
00:06:09,060 --> 00:06:10,560
ليνone who shows its worth to do it!

82
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:12,560
You laugh.

83
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:16,780
We're good at saving time.

84
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:18,840
What does it say,

85
00:06:18,940 --> 00:06:19,940
about the alliance?

86
00:06:19,940 --> 00:06:20,900
Excuse me.

87
00:06:20,900 --> 00:06:23,900
I have no self-discipline.

88
00:06:23,900 --> 00:06:24,900
You!

89
00:06:27,900 --> 00:06:28,900
Fine.

90
00:06:29,900 --> 00:06:31,900
Since you don't read the old love,

91
00:06:31,900 --> 00:06:32,900
then you should do it.

92
00:06:33,900 --> 00:06:35,900
How much money do you want to pay for this memorial?

93
00:06:38,900 --> 00:06:40,900
This is the treasure of the family.

94
00:06:43,900 --> 00:06:44,900
No.

95
00:06:44,900 --> 00:06:47,900
You don't have the money to go with the money.

96
00:06:48,900 --> 00:06:50,900
I want it all.

97
00:06:50,900 --> 00:06:51,900
I don't need the money.

98
00:06:51,900 --> 00:06:52,900
I don't need it either.

99
00:06:57,900 --> 00:06:58,900
Let me tell you.

100
00:06:58,900 --> 00:07:01,900
We are in charge of this memorial.

101
00:07:01,900 --> 00:07:02,900
I can't afford it.

102
00:07:03,900 --> 00:07:04,900
Of course, there will be others.

103
00:07:05,900 --> 00:07:06,900
Don't you eat the rice wine?

104
00:07:07,900 --> 00:07:08,900
What about the others?

105
00:07:08,900 --> 00:07:09,900
It's not as easy as me.

106
00:07:18,900 --> 00:07:19,900
Go.

107
00:07:42,900 --> 00:07:43,900
It's okay.

108
00:07:45,900 --> 00:07:46,900
Who is coming now?

109
00:07:48,900 --> 00:07:49,900
Don't buy it.

110
00:07:53,900 --> 00:07:54,900
Fine.

111
00:07:55,900 --> 00:07:56,900
Fine.

112
00:07:56,900 --> 00:07:58,900
It's good.

113
00:07:59,900 --> 00:08:00,900
Su Jingrong.

114
00:08:01,900 --> 00:08:02,900
You have the money.

115
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:04,900
Go.

116
00:08:04,900 --> 00:08:05,900
I won't give it to you.

117
00:08:05,900 --> 00:08:06,900
You don't need to give it to me.

118
00:08:07,900 --> 00:08:08,900
I will remember you.

119
00:08:12,900 --> 00:08:13,900
Dad.

120
00:08:13,900 --> 00:08:14,900
Dad.

121
00:08:14,900 --> 00:08:16,900
Didn't the doctor let you take the medicine?

122
00:08:16,900 --> 00:08:17,900
Do you remember, dad?

123
00:08:22,900 --> 00:08:23,900
Drink some water.

124
00:08:34,900 --> 00:08:35,900
Who was that person?

125
00:08:36,900 --> 00:08:37,900
He is not a thief.

126
00:08:39,900 --> 00:08:40,900
Master.

127
00:08:40,900 --> 00:08:41,900
Take it away.

128
00:08:44,900 --> 00:08:45,900
Wait a minute.

129
00:08:46,900 --> 00:08:47,900
I'll go get it.

130
00:08:56,900 --> 00:08:57,900
It's hot.

131
00:08:58,900 --> 00:08:59,900
What's wrong?

132
00:08:59,900 --> 00:09:00,900
I got burned.

133
00:09:00,900 --> 00:09:01,900
Burned?

134
00:09:01,900 --> 00:09:02,900
Where is it?

135
00:09:05,900 --> 00:09:06,900
It's okay.

136
00:09:06,900 --> 00:09:07,900
But it was red just now.

137
00:09:09,900 --> 00:09:10,900
What did it get burned?

138
00:09:11,900 --> 00:09:12,900
Mirror.

139
00:09:12,900 --> 00:09:14,900
Where did the mirror come from?

140
00:09:14,900 --> 00:09:15,900
I don't know.

141
00:09:16,900 --> 00:09:17,900
I don't know.

142
00:09:47,900 --> 00:09:48,900
isen

143
00:09:48,900 --> 00:09:52,300
Continuous

144
00:10:05,100 --> 00:10:06,100
Damn it.

145
00:10:08,100 --> 00:10:09,100
It will come back.

146
00:10:10,900 --> 00:10:11,900
Into the dark room.

147
00:10:13,900 --> 00:10:14,900
I'm stilloiset here quietly.

148
00:10:46,900 --> 00:10:47,980
Not listening to you,

149
00:10:48,420 --> 00:10:49,460
I don't know why

150
00:10:51,420 --> 00:10:52,820
not even know who went there!

151
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:02,020
Why don't many people eat?

152
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:14,540
Did I create trouble

153
00:11:16,900 --> 00:11:20,500
Old mother-in-law, Sister Wen.

154
00:11:36,300 --> 00:11:38,300
What's going on?

155
00:11:47,700 --> 00:11:51,700
An annoying girl Oh, my god.

156
00:12:12,180 --> 00:12:14,940
Father British

157
00:12:14,940 --> 00:12:15,940
Dad!

158
00:12:16,940 --> 00:12:18,940
Dad! I'm here!

159
00:12:20,940 --> 00:12:21,940
Dad!

160
00:12:22,940 --> 00:12:23,940
Master!

161
00:12:24,940 --> 00:12:25,940
Master, how are you?

162
00:12:25,940 --> 00:12:26,940
It's really me.

163
00:12:26,940 --> 00:12:28,940
You've been in the heart of the palace.

164
00:12:28,940 --> 00:12:30,940
Everyone said that you didn't see the lady.

165
00:12:31,940 --> 00:12:33,940
Dad, come here! I'm behind you!

166
00:12:34,940 --> 00:12:35,940
How can you do that?

167
00:12:35,940 --> 00:12:36,940
Master!

168
00:12:36,940 --> 00:12:38,940
Zhang Fu! Wu Xuanxian!

169
00:12:38,940 --> 00:12:39,940
Xiao Wenjian!

170
00:12:39,940 --> 00:12:40,940
Where have you been?

171
00:12:40,940 --> 00:12:41,940
Impossible!

172
00:12:41,940 --> 00:12:43,940
You've been gone for so long!

173
00:12:43,940 --> 00:12:45,940
You're really here! I'm behind you!

174
00:12:45,940 --> 00:12:46,940
Don't touch her!

175
00:12:46,940 --> 00:12:47,940
Dad! I'm right behind you!

176
00:12:47,940 --> 00:12:48,940
Dad!

177
00:13:13,940 --> 00:13:14,940
Baby!

178

Baby!

179
00:13:19,940 --> 00:13:20,940
Baby!

180
00:13:20,940 --> 00:13:21,940
Taozi?

181
00:13:23,940 --> 00:13:24,940
Taozi?

182
00:13:26,940 --> 00:13:28,940
Where are you?

183
00:13:30,940 --> 00:13:31,940
Taozi?

184
00:13:40,940 --> 00:13:41,940
Taozi?

185
00:13:41,940 --> 00:13:43,940
Tao Tao!

186
00:13:43,940 --> 00:13:45,940
Tao Tao!

187
00:13:45,940 --> 00:13:47,940
Where are you?

188
00:13:47,940 --> 00:13:49,940
Dad!

189
00:13:49,940 --> 00:13:51,940
Dad!

190
00:13:51,940 --> 00:13:53,940

193
00:14:00,940 --> 00:14:02,940
Tao Tao, you are...

194
00:14:02,940 --> 00:14:04,940
Dad, I'm at home!

195
00:14:04,940 --> 00:14:05,940
Home?

196
00:14:05,940 --> 00:14:06,940
Impossible!

197
00:14:06,940 --> 00:14:08,940
We've searched the whole house.

198
00:14:08,940 --> 00:14:10,940
We couldn't find you.

199
00:14:10,940 --> 00:14:12,940
I didn't know what's going on.

200
00:14:12,940 --> 00:14:14,940
What's your problem?

201
00:14:14,940 --> 00:14:15,940
Are you okay?

202
00:14:15,940 --> 00:14:16,940
Is there any danger?

203
00:14:16,940 --> 00:14:19,940
Dad, I'm so hungry!

204
00:14:22,940 --> 00:14:23,940
Tao Tao!

205
00:14:23,940 --> 00:14:24,940
Master!

206
00:14:24,940 --> 00:14:25,940
Don't be anxious.

207
00:14:25,940 --> 00:14:26,940
Please give me a kiss.

208
00:14:26,940 --> 00:14:28,940
Master, you're here.

209
00:14:28,940 --> 00:14:30,940
Master, Tao Tao!

210
00:14:30,940 --> 00:14:32,940
You have to come out!

211
00:14:32,940 --> 00:14:34,940
If you don't come out, how can you eat?

212
00:14:34,940 --> 00:14:36,940
Master, calm down.

213
00:14:36,940 --> 00:14:37,940
I really saw him!

214
00:14:37,940 --> 00:14:39,940
I even talked to him.

215
00:14:39,940 --> 00:14:41,940
He said he was hungry.

216
00:14:41,940 --> 00:14:45,940
I'll go find a doctor to see if you can do it.

217
00:14:48,940 --> 00:14:49,940
Dad!

218
00:14:49,940 --> 00:14:51,940
I'm so hungry!

219
00:14:51,940 --> 00:14:53,940
Tao Tao!

220
00:14:55,940 --> 00:14:57,940
I have to go find a doctor.

221
00:14:57,940 --> 00:14:58,940
Tao Tao!

222
00:14:58,940 --> 00:14:59,940
You're so sick!

223
00:15:00,940 --> 00:15:02,940
Master, wake up!

224
00:15:02,940 --> 00:15:03,940
Master!

225
00:15:03,940 --> 00:15:05,940
Master, I think our house is...

226
00:15:05,940 --> 00:15:07,940
something dirty.

227
00:15:07,940 --> 00:15:10,940
By the way, when I was on the street yesterday,

228
00:15:10,940 --> 00:15:11,940
I heard that someone from Shanghai

229
00:15:11,940 --> 00:15:13,940
asked for a seal.

230
00:15:13,940 --> 00:15:15,940
I heard that it's very useful.

231
00:15:15,940 --> 00:15:17,940
Then hurry up and ask for it!

232
00:15:17,940 --> 00:15:19,940
Master, it's here.

233
00:15:19,940 --> 00:15:21,940
Please come this way.

234
00:15:21,940 --> 00:15:22,940
Master, please.

235
00:15:23,940 --> 00:15:25,940
Master is here!

236
00:15:37,940 --> 00:15:39,940
Master, please.

237
00:15:58,940 --> 00:16:00,940
Are you sure he's always at home?

238
00:16:00,940 --> 00:16:01,940
Yes.

239
00:16:01,940 --> 00:16:03,940
He has always been at home?

240
00:16:03,940 --> 00:16:04,940
Yes.

241
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,160
You are the one I didn't know that year.

242
00:16:08,360 --> 00:16:11,340
I usually worked on my own one year in the KYAPPLAUSE.

243
00:16:12,140 --> 00:16:12,760
Go.

244
00:16:14,280 --> 00:16:15,880
What a coincidence.

245
00:16:17,560 --> 00:16:21,340
Did the girl

246
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:23,360
have a good friends

247
00:16:23,520 --> 00:16:24,180
after finishing work?

248
00:16:25,140 --> 00:16:26,180
Pat.

249
00:16:27,820 --> 00:16:29,020
Right after work.

250
00:16:30,100 --> 00:16:31,820
Was she looking out for you at the last scene?

251
00:16:33,280 --> 00:16:34,180
Yup.

252
00:16:34,180 --> 00:16:35,300
All right.

253
00:16:36,080 --> 00:16:37,140
I see.

254
00:16:38,420 --> 00:16:39,460
Slowly...

255
00:17:04,180 --> 00:17:05,260
Don't...

256
00:17:09,220 --> 00:17:10,220
Wait at this place.

257
00:17:10,420 --> 00:17:19,420
The

258
00:17:34,180 --> 00:17:37,060
and coming back to our house again?

259
00:17:38,020 --> 00:17:39,560
Remember all my father's present

260
00:17:40,180 --> 00:17:42,020
was just a memory memory.

261
00:17:43,780 --> 00:17:44,380
Do you remember

262
00:17:44,380 --> 00:17:45,700
theää fellowship

263
00:17:45,700 --> 00:17:46,580
and your royal family

264
00:17:46,580 --> 00:17:47,040
as well as

265
00:17:47,040 --> 00:17:48,080
my personal family?

266
00:17:49,180 --> 00:17:55,640
Once because we're

267
00:17:56,860 --> 00:17:59,180
just so discordant

268
00:17:59,800 --> 00:18:01,080
we're just grant mama a

269
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:02,040
chance to

270
00:18:02,040 --> 00:18:03,080
be our纸 Farmer.

271
00:18:03,800 --> 00:18:04,160
She?

272
00:18:04,180 --> 00:18:06,180
I'm afraid that the mirror can't be removed.

273
00:18:06,180 --> 00:18:08,180
I'm afraid that the mirror can't be removed.

274
00:18:08,180 --> 00:18:10,180
This mirror...

275
00:18:10,180 --> 00:18:12,180
Is it a shoe?

276
00:18:14,180 --> 00:18:16,180
It's not a shoe,

277
00:18:16,180 --> 00:18:18,180
but it must be a bone.

278
00:18:34,180 --> 00:18:36,180
Help!

279
00:18:36,180 --> 00:18:38,180
Run away!

280
00:18:38,180 --> 00:18:40,180
Run away!

281
00:18:40,180 --> 00:18:42,180
What's wrong?

282
00:18:42,180 --> 00:18:44,180
I'm here.

283
00:18:44,180 --> 00:18:46,180
I'm here.

284
00:18:46,180 --> 00:18:48,180
What's wrong?

285
00:18:48,180 --> 00:18:50,180
What's wrong?

286
00:18:50,180 --> 00:18:52,180
I'm here.

287
00:18:52,180 --> 00:18:54,180
What's wrong?

288
00:18:54,180 --> 00:18:56,180
What's wrong?

289
00:18:56,180 --> 00:18:58,180
Help!

290
00:19:05,180 --> 00:19:07,180
Where are you now?

291
00:19:08,180 --> 00:19:10,180
It's okay.

292
00:19:10,180 --> 00:19:12,180
The water is out.

293
00:19:12,180 --> 00:19:14,180
It's the same as before.

294
00:19:14,180 --> 00:19:16,180
What's wrong?

295
00:19:16,180 --> 00:19:18,180
What's wrong?

296
00:19:18,180 --> 00:19:20,180
Is she okay?

297
00:19:20,180 --> 00:19:22,180
What's your name?

298
00:19:22,180 --> 00:19:24,180
I'm...

299
00:19:24,180 --> 00:19:25,180
Who are you?

300
00:19:25,180 --> 00:19:26,180
My name is Wu Xin.

301
00:19:26,180 --> 00:19:28,180
Your father invited me here to help you.

302
00:19:28,180 --> 00:19:30,180
Really?

303
00:19:30,180 --> 00:19:31,180
Yes.

304
00:19:31,180 --> 00:19:33,180
I'll do my best to help you.

305
00:19:33,180 --> 00:19:35,180
First, tell me where you are now.

306
00:19:35,180 --> 00:19:37,180
I don't know.

307
00:19:37,180 --> 00:19:39,180
It's like my home.

308
00:19:39,180 --> 00:19:41,180
It's not...

309
00:19:41,180 --> 00:19:43,180
What do you mean?

310
00:19:43,180 --> 00:19:46,180
The buildings here are the same as my home.

311
00:19:46,180 --> 00:19:48,180
But everything is messed up.

312
00:19:48,180 --> 00:19:49,180
The space is messed up.

313
00:19:49,180 --> 00:19:51,180
The location is different from before.

314
00:19:51,180 --> 00:19:53,180
I'm standing in the corner of our house.

315
00:19:53,180 --> 00:19:54,180
I'm going to see the emergency room.

316
00:19:54,180 --> 00:19:56,180
And the living room is also turned over.

317
00:19:56,180 --> 00:19:58,180
Everything is turned over.

318
00:19:58,180 --> 00:20:00,180
I was walking on the roof before.

319
00:20:01,180 --> 00:20:03,180
Tao Tao.

320
00:20:03,180 --> 00:20:05,180
Do you hear what father said?

321
00:20:05,180 --> 00:20:07,180
Can you see me?

322
00:20:07,180 --> 00:20:08,180
I can see you.

323
00:20:08,180 --> 00:20:10,180
But I can't see you.

324
00:20:15,180 --> 00:20:17,180
Well...

325
00:20:17,180 --> 00:20:19,180
I think I know where she is.

326
00:20:19,180 --> 00:20:21,180
She's in the mirror.

327
00:20:21,180 --> 00:20:23,180
To be precise,

328
00:20:23,180 --> 00:20:25,180
she's actually in the mirror.

329
00:20:25,180 --> 00:20:27,180
The mirror made in the illusion.

330
00:20:27,180 --> 00:20:29,180
Why did she come out?

331
00:20:29,180 --> 00:20:31,180
She had to find a way out.

332
00:20:31,180 --> 00:20:32,180
A way out?

333
00:20:32,180 --> 00:20:34,180
What do you mean?

334
00:20:38,180 --> 00:20:40,180
Mr. Su.

335
00:20:40,180 --> 00:20:43,180
Can you please go back to your room?

336
00:20:44,180 --> 00:20:46,180
Why?

337
00:20:46,180 --> 00:20:50,180
To avoid trouble,

338
00:20:50,180 --> 00:20:56,180
I want to show some of my unique and mysterious magic.

339
00:20:57,180 --> 00:21:00,180
It's not convenient for outsiders to be here.

340
00:21:00,180 --> 00:21:02,180
I see.

341
00:21:02,180 --> 00:21:04,180
I'll wait for you outside.

342
00:21:04,180 --> 00:21:06,180
You can call me if you need anything.

343
00:21:06,180 --> 00:21:08,180
Okay.

344
00:21:12,180 --> 00:21:14,180
The secret method?

345
00:21:14,180 --> 00:21:17,180
When did you start to be so good at it?

346
00:21:17,180 --> 00:21:18,180
Don't talk nonsense.

347
00:21:18,180 --> 00:21:20,180
Tell me what's going on in the mirror.

348
00:21:20,180 --> 00:21:23,180
The mirror is a magic device.

349
00:21:23,180 --> 00:21:24,180
It's a medicine.

350
00:21:24,180 --> 00:21:28,180
But it sometimes takes people in.

351
00:21:28,180 --> 00:21:30,180
It tests the level of water.

352
00:21:30,180 --> 00:21:34,180
It's enough to recognize the person as the master.

353
00:21:34,180 --> 00:21:35,180
If it's not enough,

354
00:21:35,180 --> 00:21:37,180
don't want to come out alive.

355
00:21:37,180 --> 00:21:38,180
What nonsense are you talking about?

356
00:21:38,180 --> 00:21:40,180
What do you mean by that?

357
00:21:41,180 --> 00:21:44,180
Mr. Su, are you talking to me?

358
00:21:45,180 --> 00:21:47,180
I'm not talking to you.

359
00:21:48,180 --> 00:21:50,180
Only through the test,

360
00:21:50,180 --> 00:21:52,180
the mirror's exit will appear.

361
00:21:52,180 --> 00:21:53,180
What's going on?

362
00:21:54,180 --> 00:21:56,180
You're going to take people in without reason?

363
00:21:56,180 --> 00:21:57,180
It's a life for a person.

364
00:21:57,180 --> 00:22:00,180
I don't think it's a lie.

365
00:22:00,180 --> 00:22:06,180
I guess she's been in some kind of trouble.

366
00:22:06,180 --> 00:22:10,180
She's been in some kind of trouble.

367
00:22:10,180 --> 00:22:12,180
So she's been in some kind of trouble.

368
00:22:14,180 --> 00:22:15,180
What should we do now?

369
00:22:15,180 --> 00:22:16,180
I can't use it.

370
00:22:16,180 --> 00:22:18,180
If there's no exit,

371
00:22:18,180 --> 00:22:21,180
I'll let her sit in the air.

372
00:22:22,180 --> 00:22:23,180
What should we do?

373
00:22:23,180 --> 00:22:24,180
I'm telling you.

374
00:22:24,180 --> 00:22:26,180
You don't understand.

375
00:22:26,180 --> 00:22:28,180
Put the mirror on the ground.

376
00:22:46,180 --> 00:22:47,180
Okay.

377
00:22:48,180 --> 00:22:49,180
I just opened an exit

378
00:22:49,180 --> 00:22:51,180
at the connection point of the real world

379
00:22:51,180 --> 00:22:53,180
and the illusion.

380
00:22:53,180 --> 00:22:55,180
But we need to hurry up.

381
00:22:55,180 --> 00:22:56,180
I'm not sure how long

382
00:22:56,180 --> 00:22:57,180
the exit will last.

383
00:22:57,180 --> 00:22:59,180
Where's the exit?

384
00:23:00,180 --> 00:23:01,180
I'm not sure.

385
00:23:02,180 --> 00:23:03,180
Let's find it.

386
00:23:03,180 --> 00:23:04,180
What about the exit?

387
00:23:05,180 --> 00:23:06,180
Anyway,

388
00:23:06,180 --> 00:23:08,180
it won't say the exit.

389
00:23:18,180 --> 00:23:19,180
Mr. Feng, how is it?

390
00:23:19,180 --> 00:23:20,180
Find the exit.

391
00:23:20,180 --> 00:23:21,180
The exit?

392
00:23:23,180 --> 00:23:24,180
The exit?

393
00:23:24,180 --> 00:23:25,180
Is it the exit?

394
00:23:25,180 --> 00:23:26,180
You asked me.

395
00:23:26,180 --> 00:23:27,180
I didn't know.

396
00:23:28,180 --> 00:23:29,180
Master.

397
00:23:29,180 --> 00:23:30,180
Master.

398
00:23:30,180 --> 00:23:32,180
Hurry up and get the key.

399
00:23:38,180 --> 00:23:39,180
Bailoli,

400
00:23:39,180 --> 00:23:40,180
I think it's a good idea

401
00:23:40,180 --> 00:23:41,180
to go to the exit.

402
00:23:41,180 --> 00:23:42,180
I'm sure.

403
00:23:42,180 --> 00:23:43,180
I'm sure.

404
00:23:43,180 --> 00:23:44,180
I'm sure.

405
00:23:44,180 --> 00:23:45,180
I'm sure.

406
00:23:45,180 --> 00:23:46,180
I'm sure.

407
00:23:46,180 --> 00:23:47,180
I think it's here.

408
00:23:48,180 --> 00:23:49,180
I think it's here, too.

409
00:23:51,180 --> 00:23:52,180
Bailoli.

410
00:23:52,180 --> 00:23:53,180
Can you hear me?

411
00:23:54,180 --> 00:23:55,180
Yes.

412
00:23:55,180 --> 00:23:56,180
You're now in the backyard.

413
00:23:56,180 --> 00:23:58,180
Can you see the exit?

414
00:23:59,180 --> 00:24:00,180
I might not find it.

415
00:24:00,180 --> 00:24:01,180
I open the door every time.

416
00:24:01,180 --> 00:24:03,180
The exit is the same.

417
00:24:04,180 --> 00:24:05,180
Well, you can find it.

418
00:24:06,180 --> 00:24:07,180
I'll think of a way.

419
00:24:07,180 --> 00:24:08,180
Okay.

420
00:24:14,180 --> 00:24:15,180
Master, look.

421
00:24:15,180 --> 00:24:16,180
The hairpin is over there.

422
00:24:38,180 --> 00:24:39,180
Wu Xin.

423
00:24:39,180 --> 00:24:40,180
Wu Xin.

424
00:24:40,180 --> 00:24:41,180
Wu Xin.

425
00:24:46,180 --> 00:24:47,180
Master.

426
00:24:47,180 --> 00:24:48,180
Master.

427
00:25:15,180 --> 00:25:17,180
The number of people here is the same as my house.

428
00:25:18,180 --> 00:25:19,180
But everything is messed up.

429
00:25:19,180 --> 00:25:20,180
The space is messed up.

430
00:25:20,180 --> 00:25:22,180
The location is different from before.

431
00:25:22,180 --> 00:25:24,180
I'm in the corridor of our house.

432
00:25:24,180 --> 00:25:25,180
I open the door to find the exit.

433
00:25:26,180 --> 00:25:27,180
And the living room is turned over, too.

434
00:25:27,180 --> 00:25:29,180
Everything is turned over.

435
00:25:32,180 --> 00:25:33,180
I'm here.

436
00:25:34,180 --> 00:25:35,180
I'm here.

437
00:25:36,180 --> 00:25:37,180
I'm here.

438
00:25:37,180 --> 00:25:38,180
I'm here.

439
00:25:38,180 --> 00:25:39,180
I'm here.

440
00:25:39,180 --> 00:25:40,180
I'm here.

441
00:25:40,180 --> 00:25:41,180
I'm here.

442
00:25:41,180 --> 00:25:42,180
I'm here.

443
00:25:42,180 --> 00:25:43,180
I'm here.

444
00:25:43,180 --> 00:25:44,180
I'm here.

445
00:25:44,180 --> 00:25:45,180
I'm here.

446
00:25:45,180 --> 00:25:46,180
I'm here.

447
00:25:46,180 --> 00:25:47,180
I'm here.

448
00:25:49,180 --> 00:25:50,180
Wu Xin.

449
00:25:51,180 --> 00:25:52,180
Where's your man?

450
00:25:52,180 --> 00:25:53,180
Hey.

451
00:25:53,180 --> 00:25:54,180
I think I'm in the changing room.

452
00:25:56,180 --> 00:25:57,180
Why are you going in?

453
00:25:57,180 --> 00:25:58,180
Is it messy?

454
00:26:00,180 --> 00:26:01,180
It's good that I'm here.

455
00:26:01,180 --> 00:26:03,180
Maybe I can find Su Tao.

456
00:26:03,180 --> 00:26:04,180
I'll take him out later.

457
00:26:05,180 --> 00:26:06,180
Su Tao.

458
00:26:06,180 --> 00:26:07,180
Su Tao.

459
00:26:14,180 --> 00:26:15,180
Su Tao.

460
00:26:27,180 --> 00:26:28,180
Su Tao.

461
00:26:34,180 --> 00:26:35,180
Su Tao.

462
00:26:38,180 --> 00:26:39,180
Su Tao.

463
00:26:40,180 --> 00:26:41,180
Su Tao.

464
00:26:44,180 --> 00:26:45,220
Wu Tong.

465
00:26:46,860 --> 00:26:47,700
Wu Tong.

466
00:26:47,700 --> 00:26:49,580
Okay, okay. Stop looking.

467
00:26:49,580 --> 00:26:51,140
He shouldn't be here.

468
00:26:51,140 --> 00:26:52,220
Why?

469
00:26:52,220 --> 00:26:54,820
Because there's only one person in the illusion.

470
00:26:55,780 --> 00:26:58,260
I opened that exit by force.

471
00:26:58,260 --> 00:26:59,700
You went in there.

472
00:26:59,700 --> 00:27:02,860
Maybe Jin Zong didn't think you'd accept the test.

473
00:27:02,860 --> 00:27:05,660
So I built a new illusion for you.

474
00:27:07,260 --> 00:27:09,380
So you mean I'm in my illusion.

475
00:27:09,380 --> 00:27:10,820
He's in his illusion?

476
00:27:11,820 --> 00:27:13,220
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

477
00:27:13,220 --> 00:27:14,340
I've been here for a long time.

478
00:27:14,340 --> 00:27:15,260
I'm tired.

479
00:27:15,260 --> 00:27:16,780
Is it possible?

480
00:27:16,780 --> 00:27:18,820
Nothing can happen.

481
00:27:21,060 --> 00:27:22,260
So,

482
00:27:22,260 --> 00:27:24,660
although we're not in the same illusion,

483
00:27:24,660 --> 00:27:26,940
the exit is the same, right?

484
00:27:26,940 --> 00:27:27,820
Yes.

485
00:27:27,820 --> 00:27:29,940
No matter how many illusions there are,

486
00:27:29,940 --> 00:27:32,100
they're all based on this house.

487
00:27:32,100 --> 00:27:33,300
It's created.

488
00:27:33,300 --> 00:27:36,540
The exit is the connection between illusion and reality.

489
00:27:36,540 --> 00:27:37,700
There's only one.

490
00:27:41,100 --> 00:27:42,660
So,

491
00:27:42,660 --> 00:27:44,660
I just need to find the connection point,

492
00:27:44,660 --> 00:27:46,180
which is the exit.

493
00:27:46,180 --> 00:27:47,700
I can go out.

494
00:27:47,700 --> 00:27:48,900
I think so.

495
00:28:11,100 --> 00:28:12,260
Li Li,

496
00:28:12,260 --> 00:28:14,580
the scene is the same as the scene just now.

497
00:28:14,580 --> 00:28:16,140
The yard is the same.

498
00:28:16,900 --> 00:28:18,460
It's strange to see less.

499
00:28:18,460 --> 00:28:21,660
Since it's the connection point between illusion and reality,

500
00:28:21,660 --> 00:28:24,380
it's still a good thing to see.

501
00:28:24,380 --> 00:28:25,660
But,

502
00:28:25,660 --> 00:28:28,420
it's useless to just find the exit.

503
00:28:28,420 --> 00:28:30,020
I can call him out.

504
00:28:30,020 --> 00:28:31,860
Su Tao!

505
00:28:31,860 --> 00:28:33,620
Are you stupid?

506
00:28:33,620 --> 00:28:35,780
He didn't respond after calling out for a long time.

507
00:28:35,780 --> 00:28:39,540
That means he didn't hear you.

508
00:28:39,540 --> 00:28:40,700
What do you think?

509
00:28:40,740 --> 00:28:42,020
Don't ask me.

510
00:28:42,020 --> 00:28:43,380
I won't ask you.

511
00:28:43,380 --> 00:28:44,940
I want you to cooperate.

512
00:28:44,940 --> 00:28:46,220
If it wasn't for me,

513
00:28:46,220 --> 00:28:48,260
you'd still be holding your own blood

514
00:28:48,260 --> 00:28:50,180
and being a fool.

515
00:28:50,180 --> 00:28:51,660
You'd still feel it

516
00:28:51,660 --> 00:28:53,580
if you had your own blood.

517
00:28:56,420 --> 00:28:58,380
Can you see it?

518
00:29:00,500 --> 00:29:02,620
Can you see the secret room?

519
00:29:06,020 --> 00:29:06,700
Come on.

520
00:29:06,700 --> 00:29:08,580
Come with me to find Master Su.

521
00:29:11,540 --> 00:29:13,700
So long as you He is here,

522
00:29:13,700 --> 00:29:16,100
I'll remember you.

523
00:29:19,100 --> 00:29:20,220
Lord Su Tao!

524
00:29:20,220 --> 00:29:21,620
Lord Su Tao!

525
00:29:21,620 --> 00:29:22,860
Master Su!

526
00:29:24,180 --> 00:29:26,260
The person is still inside.

527
00:29:26,260 --> 00:29:27,660
Han Shuo!

528
00:29:28,660 --> 00:29:29,940
That is Master Su.

529
00:29:29,980 --> 00:29:31,300
Don't,

530
00:29:31,300 --> 00:29:33,180
it's not出來 yet.

531
00:29:33,180 --> 00:29:35,620
The instructions welled up in Qi焊's hands.

532
00:29:35,620 --> 00:29:37,300
He is waiting.

533
00:29:37,340 --> 00:29:38,340
Thank you.

534
00:29:38,340 --> 00:29:42,640
Beautiful

535
00:29:58,000 --> 00:29:59,600
немo

536
00:31:38,340 --> 00:31:39,340
Thank you.

537
00:31:39,340 --> 00:31:41,340
That girl doesn't know what you're doing.

538
00:31:41,340 --> 00:31:42,340
She's a ghost.

539
00:32:09,340 --> 00:32:14,340
In the mortal world, everything is not real.

540
00:32:14,340 --> 00:32:18,340
The one who is in the heart is the one who is in the world.

541
00:32:19,340 --> 00:32:24,340
I will wait for you at the exit.

542
00:33:09,340 --> 00:33:12,340
Darling

543
00:33:24,520 --> 00:33:26,620
on my official account

544
00:33:26,620 --> 00:33:29,340
Drake Ich appetite

545
00:33:29,340 --> 00:33:33,060
It's sunny

546
00:33:33,060 --> 00:33:35,200
Yes,

547
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:37,200
I'm Wu Xin. I'll take you away from here.

548
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:38,200
You finally came out.

549
00:33:38,200 --> 00:33:39,200
If you don't come out,

550
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:41,200
my blood will be drained.

551
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:43,200
You wrote that again?

552
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:45,200
You wrote it again?

553
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:46,200
I'm Wu Xin.

554
00:33:46,200 --> 00:33:47,200
I'll take you away from here.

555
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:48,200
You finally came out.

556
00:33:48,200 --> 00:33:49,200
You finally came out.

557
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:50,200
You finally came out.

558
00:33:50,200 --> 00:33:51,200
You finally came out.

559
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:52,200
You finally came out.

560
00:33:52,200 --> 00:33:53,200
You finally came out.

561
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:54,200
You finally came out.

562
00:33:54,200 --> 00:33:55,200
You finally came out.

563
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:56,200
You finally came out.

564
00:33:56,200 --> 00:33:57,200
You finally came out.

565
00:33:57,200 --> 00:33:58,200
You finally came out.

566
00:33:58,200 --> 00:33:59,200
You finally came out.

567
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:00,200
You finally came out.

568
00:34:00,200 --> 00:34:01,200
You finally came out.

569
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:02,200
You finally came out.

570
00:34:02,200 --> 00:34:03,200
You finally came out.

571
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:04,200
You finally came out.

572
00:34:04,200 --> 00:34:05,200
You finally came out.

573
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:09,200
There's nothing else around here.

574
00:34:09,200 --> 00:34:11,200
How painful is it?

575
00:34:11,200 --> 00:34:12,200
It's okay.

576
00:34:12,200 --> 00:34:13,200
Let's leave here quickly.

577
00:34:13,200 --> 00:34:14,200
Your father is in a hurry.

578
00:34:15,200 --> 00:34:16,200
Okay.

579
00:34:16,200 --> 00:34:18,200
But how do we get out?

580
00:34:18,200 --> 00:34:19,200
That way.

581
00:34:19,200 --> 00:34:20,200
Just jump in.

582
00:34:22,200 --> 00:34:23,200
Don't be afraid.

583
00:34:23,200 --> 00:34:24,200
I just came in like this.

584
00:34:26,200 --> 00:34:27,200
Don't be afraid.

585
00:34:35,200 --> 00:34:36,200
But it's dark.

586
00:34:36,200 --> 00:34:38,200
I can't see anything.

587
00:34:39,200 --> 00:34:40,200
You're still scared, right?

588
00:34:44,200 --> 00:34:45,200
How about this?

589
00:34:45,200 --> 00:34:46,200
I'll jump first.

590
00:34:47,200 --> 00:34:48,200
But this...

591
00:34:48,200 --> 00:34:49,200
It's okay.

592
00:34:56,200 --> 00:34:57,200
Wu Xin.

593
00:34:57,200 --> 00:34:58,200
Wu Xin.

594
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:00,200
Can you hear me?

595
00:35:05,200 --> 00:35:06,200
Wu Xin.

596
00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:14,200
Who are you?

597
00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:16,200
You and I

598
00:35:16,200 --> 00:35:17,200
haven't had enough.

599
00:35:34,200 --> 00:35:35,200
What are you doing?

600
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:36,200
Are you crazy?

601
00:35:38,200 --> 00:35:39,200
No.

602
00:35:39,200 --> 00:35:40,200
What?

603
00:35:42,200 --> 00:35:43,200
You said that the mirror

604
00:35:43,200 --> 00:35:44,200
can make you see the demon?

605
00:35:45,200 --> 00:35:46,200
That's not a good idea.

606
00:35:48,200 --> 00:35:49,200
Well,

607
00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:50,200
I don't know if I can make you happy.

608
00:35:51,200 --> 00:35:52,200
But I'm not going to do that.

609
00:35:52,200 --> 00:35:53,200
I'm going to die.

610
00:35:54,200 --> 00:35:55,200
Why?

611
00:35:56,200 --> 00:35:57,200
You're not going to die?

612
00:35:57,200 --> 00:35:58,200
You're not going to die?

613
00:35:58,200 --> 00:35:59,200
I know.

614
00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:00,200
You're not going to die?

615
00:36:02,200 --> 00:36:03,200
What are you thinking?

616
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:04,200
Uh...

617
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:06,000
Will you die?

618
00:36:07,880 --> 00:36:08,680
Su Tao! Su Tao!

619
00:36:09,120 --> 00:36:09,760
Su Tao!

620
00:36:10,240 --> 00:36:11,280
Don't jump into the water!

621
00:36:13,400 --> 00:36:14,600
Can you hear me?

622
00:36:22,680 --> 00:36:23,760
Why is the window gone?

623
00:36:25,560 --> 00:36:26,600
It's gone.

624
00:36:27,200 --> 00:36:28,480
Let's open it again.

625
00:36:33,440 --> 00:36:35,800
You have hurtitateOSS.

626
00:36:35,960 --> 00:36:37,040
Why are you still there?

627
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:40,360
The Fire Mirror missed.

628
00:36:40,560 --> 00:36:43,040
Let's hide in thebased wall for a while.

629
00:36:45,240 --> 00:36:46,520
A-Are you still here?

630
00:36:47,040 --> 00:36:47,800
I'm here.

631
00:36:47,800 --> 00:36:48,920
Su Tao.

632
00:36:49,480 --> 00:36:50,600
Where am I?

633
00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:51,720
Where are you?

634
00:36:51,960 --> 00:36:52,560
Why are you here?

635
00:36:52,920 --> 00:36:53,640
Eh...

636
00:36:53,960 --> 00:36:54,880
No.

637
00:36:55,040 --> 00:36:56,080
He's pretty.

638
00:37:00,320 --> 00:37:01,520
What?

639
00:37:01,520 --> 00:37:05,520
What can a little girl like her do?

640
00:37:07,520 --> 00:37:08,520
But...

641
00:37:08,520 --> 00:37:11,520
What did I just see?

642
00:37:32,520 --> 00:37:35,520
You're Su Teng?

643
00:37:39,520 --> 00:37:42,520
I'm Wu Xin. Welcome back.

644
00:37:45,520 --> 00:37:47,520
Hashi.

645
00:37:47,520 --> 00:37:51,520
You've never let such a small girl go.

646
00:37:52,520 --> 00:37:54,520
I'm sorry.

647
00:37:58,520 --> 00:38:01,520
Just call me Tao Tao.

648
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:04,520
Okay.

649
00:38:21,520 --> 00:38:28,520
The wind carries her on the longest journey.

650
00:38:28,520 --> 00:38:36,520
I've been following the sunset, but it hasn't stopped.

651
00:38:36,520 --> 00:38:43,520
I've asked the flowers in the night with warm stars.

652
00:38:43,520 --> 00:38:50,520
I've been wandering around, but I still remember the hometown.

653
00:38:50,520 --> 00:38:57,520
Life is a legend, but the time is a corner.

654
00:38:57,520 --> 00:39:04,520
She's watching people's love and hate.

655
00:39:04,520 --> 00:39:12,520
Although time has passed, she's forgotten her memories.

656
00:39:12,520 --> 00:39:19,520
She's leaving her memories and repeating herself.

657
00:39:19,520 --> 00:39:27,520
Life is a legend, but the time is a corner.

658
00:39:27,520 --> 00:39:34,520
She's watching people's love and hate.

659
00:39:34,520 --> 00:39:41,520
Although time has passed, she's forgotten her memories.

660
00:39:41,520 --> 00:39:48,520
She's leaving her memories and repeating herself.

661
00:39:48,520 --> 00:39:59,520
She's leaving her memories and repeating herself.
