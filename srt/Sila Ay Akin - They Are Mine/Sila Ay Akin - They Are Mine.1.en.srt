1
00:01:14,616 --> 00:01:21,125
Years before the pandemic

2
00:01:31,086 --> 00:01:33,130
When we escaped to Baguio

3
00:01:33,155 --> 00:01:36,116
I thought it was going
to be a fresh start for him.

4
00:01:36,202 --> 00:01:39,414
But now he’s in trouble again.

5
00:01:40,913 --> 00:01:42,122
Rest.

6
00:01:42,147 --> 00:01:46,485
He can't help but protect
a friend in trouble.

7
00:01:48,193 --> 00:01:52,448
Nothing pleases him more
than planning our future together.

8
00:01:53,357 --> 00:01:55,609
I have no doubt he loves me.

9
00:01:55,634 --> 00:01:57,511
He can't lie.

10
00:02:00,189 --> 00:02:05,633
But once he witnesses any kind
of injustice, he loses it.

11
00:02:12,486 --> 00:02:13,779
It’s such a pity.

12
00:02:13,779 --> 00:02:16,574
I’ve grown fond
of thrift shopping.

13
00:02:18,152 --> 00:02:21,370
I'd gotten used to my rosy cheeks
in the cold climate.

14
00:02:21,861 --> 00:02:27,944
I'm sure he'll miss his job,
and his horse at Wright Park.

15
00:02:29,217 --> 00:02:31,052
That’s the way it goes.

16
00:02:31,435 --> 00:02:35,485
After all, I love him and choose
to be wherever he is.

17
00:02:35,962 --> 00:02:37,871
This is now our third move.

18
00:02:39,424 --> 00:02:43,684
It’s good that he agreed to stay
with his mother and his brother.

19
00:02:52,953 --> 00:02:54,730
- Hello, Ma.
- JC?

20
00:02:54,755 --> 00:02:56,053
Yes, we’re in Manila.

21
00:02:56,078 --> 00:02:57,336
Thank goodness.

22
00:02:57,380 --> 00:03:00,914
We’re fine. I just called to
let you know we’ve arrived.

23
00:03:00,939 --> 00:03:02,997
- Okay. Take care.
- Yes.

24
00:03:03,513 --> 00:03:05,607
- See you, Ma.
- Yes.

25
00:03:07,099 --> 00:03:08,601
Ma will be happy to meet you.

26
00:03:08,626 --> 00:03:10,789
She will be happy to see you.

27
00:03:14,298 --> 00:03:17,535
Let's go. One ride
and we’re home.

28
00:03:34,829 --> 00:03:38,119
You'll get to try Ma's cooking.
It's the best.

29
00:03:38,144 --> 00:03:39,144
Really?

30
00:04:07,768 --> 00:04:11,289
The family reunites

31
00:04:11,367 --> 00:04:12,911
JC!

32
00:04:13,044 --> 00:04:15,219
- JC, my child.
- Ma.

33
00:04:16,414 --> 00:04:21,252
- I missed my youngest.
- I miss you too Ma.

34
00:04:23,036 --> 00:04:25,866
You look like a cowboy
with this hat.

35
00:04:26,231 --> 00:04:29,944
- I missed my youngest.
- Ma, is breakfast available?

36
00:04:29,974 --> 00:04:34,395
Of course. And it’s not
leftovers from what I sell.

37
00:04:34,420 --> 00:04:38,610
I cooked your favorites, smoked fish,
and fried eggs.

38
00:04:39,242 --> 00:04:42,860
- This is Maritess.
- Hello.

39
00:04:43,243 --> 00:04:44,243
Your wife?

40
00:04:44,343 --> 00:04:45,761
We’re not married yet.

41
00:04:45,786 --> 00:04:53,460
If you love each other and live together,
you’re husband and wife.

42
00:04:53,485 --> 00:04:56,016
- Blessings, Ma.
- Bless you.

43
00:04:56,233 --> 00:05:00,993
You’re so pretty.

44
00:05:01,018 --> 00:05:03,032
You and my son make a beautiful couple.

45
00:05:03,057 --> 00:05:07,063
Come, I’m sure you’re hungry.

46
00:05:07,344 --> 00:05:09,221
How long have you been together?

47
00:05:09,246 --> 00:05:11,124
Almost three years.

48
00:05:11,149 --> 00:05:15,350
I like that. It means you know
and truly love my son

49
00:05:15,375 --> 00:05:17,741
because I know how difficult it is
to live with him.

50
00:05:17,766 --> 00:05:20,944
Ma, I thought we were a team.

51
00:05:20,969 --> 00:05:23,852
- He’s not hard to live with.
- I really like you.

52
00:05:27,281 --> 00:05:30,993
Come, Maritess. Josie!
My son JC is home!

53
00:05:31,018 --> 00:05:34,975
How are you, Josie?
Does my big brother have a Junior now?

54
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:40,125
We’re all process
and no fruit.

55
00:05:40,358 --> 00:05:43,130
It’s not time yet,
as your brother would say.

56
00:05:43,155 --> 00:05:45,765
I admire his discipline.

57
00:05:46,567 --> 00:05:49,445
Maritess, meet Josie,
my brother Pau’s wife.

58
00:05:49,671 --> 00:05:53,062
Josie, Maritess.
My girlfr… wife.

59
00:05:53,223 --> 00:05:54,349
We’re also not married.

60
00:05:54,374 --> 00:05:55,992
It’s not so popular these days.

61
00:05:56,017 --> 00:05:59,438
Josie, text Pau that
his brother is home.

62
00:05:59,463 --> 00:06:01,590
So we can all eat together.

63
00:06:01,590 --> 00:06:02,466
- Yes, Ma.
- Sweetie…

64
00:06:02,466 --> 00:06:03,884
- Are you okay?
- Yes, ma’am.

65
00:06:03,884 --> 00:06:05,242
Feel at home.

66
00:06:05,652 --> 00:06:09,782
Come here, Queenie.
JC, there’s someone I want you to meet.

67
00:06:09,807 --> 00:06:11,664
Queenie, he’s the one
I keep telling you about.

68
00:06:11,929 --> 00:06:16,121
My youngest, your Big Brother JC.

69
00:06:16,146 --> 00:06:19,124
Handsome, isn’t he?
He looks just like his father.

70
00:06:19,149 --> 00:06:21,398
- And she is Maritess.
- Hello.

71
00:06:22,169 --> 00:06:24,545
This is Queenie, my ward.

72
00:06:24,570 --> 00:06:27,800
Go set the table.

73
00:06:27,825 --> 00:06:34,584
You and Maritess
will stay in my bed.

74
00:06:34,609 --> 00:06:36,750
Queenie and I will sleep on the floor.

75
00:06:36,809 --> 00:06:40,854
Let’s put up a curtain,
so you have privacy.

76
00:06:40,908 --> 00:06:43,661
We’ll take the floor.

77
00:06:43,686 --> 00:06:47,773
No way! You’re our guests.
Come, let’s eat.

78
00:07:01,484 --> 00:07:03,850
- Excuse me!
- Yes?

79
00:07:03,875 --> 00:07:07,164
Gin and ten pesos
worth of ice.

80
00:07:07,305 --> 00:07:08,305
Here.

81
00:07:08,351 --> 00:07:09,421
Get the last piece.

82
00:07:09,446 --> 00:07:11,312
- Go for it!
- I’m full.

83
00:07:11,706 --> 00:07:16,377
- You sure you’re done, Josie?
- Yes, Ma.

84
00:07:16,513 --> 00:07:18,390
Queenie, help Josie clean up.

85
00:07:19,050 --> 00:07:21,367
How do you make
smoked fish taste so good?

86
00:07:21,392 --> 00:07:24,203
I buy only the freshest ones.

87
00:07:26,523 --> 00:07:32,700
- Bro!
- Bro, I missed you. How are you?

88
00:07:32,725 --> 00:07:33,768
I’m good. You?

89
00:07:33,793 --> 00:07:35,378
I’m bigger than you now.

90
00:07:35,492 --> 00:07:38,829
I bought us a drink.
Shots after we eat.

91
00:07:38,854 --> 00:07:40,390
As always.

92
00:07:40,538 --> 00:07:44,292
Bro, this is my wife Maritess,
though we’re not married yet.

93
00:07:44,317 --> 00:07:47,070
Maritess, meet my favorite brother.

94
00:07:47,922 --> 00:07:50,133
I’m your only brother, stupid.

95
00:07:50,158 --> 00:07:51,765
That’s why I don’t have a choice.

96
00:07:53,124 --> 00:07:54,367
Pau, eat.

97
00:07:56,783 --> 00:08:00,062
Drinking comes first
with these two.

98
00:08:00,087 --> 00:08:01,146
Better booze than babes.

99
00:08:01,171 --> 00:08:02,839
One, two.

100
00:08:03,061 --> 00:08:04,479
- This is for you.
- Thank you.

101
00:08:04,504 --> 00:08:06,006
Eat up.

102
00:08:06,676 --> 00:08:09,554
Queenie, I have something for you.

103
00:08:09,950 --> 00:08:12,040
Your favorite chocolate.

104
00:08:16,308 --> 00:08:20,875
Son, take my place.

105
00:08:22,133 --> 00:08:24,844
- What’s that?
- I have something to give you.

106
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,711
Why don’t you add this
to your savings instead?

107
00:08:27,736 --> 00:08:30,113
Stop it, Ma. That’s yours.

108
00:08:30,208 --> 00:08:31,960
Thank you, son.

109
00:08:32,169 --> 00:08:34,771
What’s the last piece
still doing there?

110
00:08:34,796 --> 00:08:36,871
That is so Filipino.

111
00:08:36,924 --> 00:08:39,348
Josie, take care of Maritess, okay?

112
00:08:39,373 --> 00:08:40,859
The devil’s shot.

113
00:08:40,982 --> 00:08:47,405
Queenie and I are going to the market.
Get some sleep after those shots, okay?

114
00:08:48,023 --> 00:08:49,091
Yes, Ma. Take care.

115
00:08:49,091 --> 00:08:50,211
Take care, Ma.

116
00:08:51,109 --> 00:08:54,721
Being together like this
makes me happy.

117
00:08:54,746 --> 00:08:56,791
I missed you, my youngest.

118
00:08:58,952 --> 00:09:02,964
Ma, no drama allowed
in our family, remember?

119
00:09:03,820 --> 00:09:06,230
Hey, Ma can control
her tears now.

120
00:09:06,545 --> 00:09:09,044
Except on Christmas
and her birthday.

121
00:09:09,153 --> 00:09:11,864
She misses you too much.

122
00:09:11,889 --> 00:09:17,179
She hides it, though, because she knows
I won’t give her gifts if there’s crying.

123
00:09:17,228 --> 00:09:21,031
Enough drinking, go to sleep.

124
00:09:21,056 --> 00:09:22,070
Let's go.

125
00:09:22,118 --> 00:09:25,250
- Ma, bring me back some cassava cake.
- Okay.

126
00:09:28,797 --> 00:09:30,590
- Your turn.
- There's still some left!

127
00:09:30,906 --> 00:09:36,096
Ma found Queenie on the pavement
around four years ago.

128
00:09:37,505 --> 00:09:40,991
She was on her way home
when she heard someone groaning.

129
00:09:41,224 --> 00:09:44,258
She saw Queenie bleeding.

130
00:09:45,267 --> 00:09:46,882
I’m not sure
but I think her stepfather raped her.

131
00:09:48,353 --> 00:09:50,720
She fought back, got beaten up.

132
00:09:52,904 --> 00:09:55,782
She ran away
and ended up here.

133
00:09:55,816 --> 00:09:58,402
You’re not sure
if she was raped?

134
00:09:58,808 --> 00:10:02,200
She’s mute, but she can hear.

135
00:10:02,952 --> 00:10:05,588
Maybe she stopped talking
due to the trauma.

136
00:10:07,178 --> 00:10:10,531
Her mind… it’s not all there.

137
00:10:10,902 --> 00:10:13,405
Sometimes she acts like a child.

138
00:10:13,599 --> 00:10:15,689
We couldn’t get the full story out of her.

139
00:10:17,679 --> 00:10:20,708
We reported it to the police.
Nothing came of it.

140
00:10:21,596 --> 00:10:25,879
Social Welfare took her
but she escaped to come back here.

141
00:10:26,534 --> 00:10:28,577
So, Ma took her in.

142
00:10:29,031 --> 00:10:31,539
She’s a good girl.
Helps Ma.

143
00:10:31,564 --> 00:10:34,265
I’m a has-been at the bar.

144
00:10:34,850 --> 00:10:40,234
The customers like them young.

145
00:10:41,375 --> 00:10:46,429
I’d be left with the older gays and aunties
who prefer veterans like me

146
00:10:46,917 --> 00:10:52,114
who do everything in bed
while their lazy asses do nothing.

147
00:10:54,930 --> 00:10:59,560
Why not find another job?

148
00:11:00,341 --> 00:11:04,640
I still make good money.
Especially when I dance.

149
00:11:04,894 --> 00:11:07,771
And even if I’m a lot less popular now,
I still get customers.

150
00:11:07,796 --> 00:11:09,578
There’s too much horniness out there.

151
00:11:09,863 --> 00:11:15,888
Once in a while I hit the jackpot
and get someone with lots to spend.

152
00:11:16,889 --> 00:11:22,603
I never doubted you.
You always have a plan.

153
00:11:24,538 --> 00:11:29,860
I’ve saved almost enough
to redeem the land that Ma pawned.

154
00:11:30,687 --> 00:11:33,611
Josie and I plan to go back
to the province and live there.

155
00:11:34,575 --> 00:11:38,869
I hope Ma comes with us.

156
00:11:41,394 --> 00:11:42,832
Shot!

157
00:11:44,435 --> 00:11:47,629
Pau asked me to quit my job at the bar
when we moved in together.

158
00:11:48,898 --> 00:11:51,692
I was fine with it.
I never really liked it there.

159
00:11:52,065 --> 00:11:55,678
But here I’m happy.
I grew up not knowing my family.

160
00:11:56,515 --> 00:11:59,476
And with Pau, I feel safe.

161
00:12:00,088 --> 00:12:02,716
He knows how to keep his word.

162
00:12:03,441 --> 00:12:05,938
You’re okay with
his job as a stripper?

163
00:12:07,351 --> 00:12:09,817
Why not?
I used to be a go-go dancer myself.

164
00:12:10,044 --> 00:12:11,360
I choose not to be choosy.

165
00:12:12,144 --> 00:12:14,448
When are you settling down?

166
00:12:15,948 --> 00:12:18,601
Maybe it’s time to get serious
about your life.

167
00:12:20,995 --> 00:12:22,955
I am serious.

168
00:12:23,847 --> 00:12:27,001
In fact, I was already focused on the life
Maritess and I were building in Baguio.

169
00:12:28,850 --> 00:12:32,863
I thought we'd stay there for good.
We're fine having a simple life.

170
00:12:33,069 --> 00:12:35,384
Even if I smelled like a horse
because of my job.

171
00:12:36,911 --> 00:12:40,332
That job suits you,
you’re hung like a horse!

172
00:12:42,782 --> 00:12:43,812
But then…

173
00:12:43,837 --> 00:12:45,536
You got into trouble again.

174
00:12:48,669 --> 00:12:49,857
I can’t help it.

175
00:12:51,695 --> 00:12:54,153
When someone takes advantage
of someone, I see red

176
00:12:54,538 --> 00:12:56,248
and I can’t think clearly.

177
00:12:56,273 --> 00:13:00,993
You have a knack for making
other people’s problems your own.

178
00:13:03,933 --> 00:13:08,851
I helped a friend who got beaten up
and was unable to defend himself.

179
00:13:08,973 --> 00:13:11,100
You could’ve just brought him
to the hospital.

180
00:13:12,117 --> 00:13:13,436
But no, you had to avenge him.

181
00:13:13,649 --> 00:13:15,383
And you stabbed a gang member
in the process.

182
00:13:15,679 --> 00:13:17,535
Good thing he survived.

183
00:13:18,290 --> 00:13:20,667
A gang member, man!

184
00:13:21,015 --> 00:13:23,085
If they went after you,
you wouldn’t stand a chance.

185
00:13:23,666 --> 00:13:25,642
Maritess said the same thing.

186
00:13:25,703 --> 00:13:27,205
JC is a good man.

187
00:13:27,614 --> 00:13:31,159
I love that he has principles,
and he's honest.

188
00:13:31,331 --> 00:13:34,429
He just can’t lie,
not even if you put a gun to his head.

189
00:13:35,105 --> 00:13:38,551
But he needs taking care of.
He has mood swings.

190
00:13:39,043 --> 00:13:40,887
And he lacks ambition.

191
00:13:41,091 --> 00:13:43,134
Do you have a dream for yourself?

192
00:13:43,412 --> 00:13:44,788
It used to be clear and simple.

193
00:13:44,813 --> 00:13:46,205
To become a security guard.

194
00:13:47,015 --> 00:13:48,181
SG?

195
00:13:48,212 --> 00:13:51,335
But my father got killed
when I was in sixth grade.

196
00:13:53,089 --> 00:13:54,148
Killed?

197
00:13:54,406 --> 00:13:57,841
He was a security guard for a warehouse.
Someone robbed it.

198
00:13:58,083 --> 00:14:01,711
His colleagues told him it’s safer
to knock yourself out

199
00:14:01,798 --> 00:14:03,788
or pretend to be unconscious
than confront burglars head on.

200
00:14:03,912 --> 00:14:05,849
My father decided to be a hero.

201
00:14:06,209 --> 00:14:10,396
He always said his job
was to protect his territory.

202
00:14:10,812 --> 00:14:12,467
So he went looking for the thief

203
00:14:13,198 --> 00:14:14,783
and got himself shot.

204
00:14:17,126 --> 00:14:20,452
My father was decent. And loving.

205
00:14:22,319 --> 00:14:23,648
What about your mother?

206
00:14:24,378 --> 00:14:26,436
She died giving birth to me.

207
00:14:26,605 --> 00:14:29,063
My father never remarried.

208
00:14:29,621 --> 00:14:31,710
His life revolved around me.

209
00:14:32,064 --> 00:14:33,891
We shared the same dreams.

210
00:14:35,271 --> 00:14:37,381
But those vanished with his passing.

211
00:14:39,399 --> 00:14:43,778
It wasn’t until I met JC
that I started to dream again.

212
00:14:54,174 --> 00:14:57,359
Come with me to the bar
while you’re still looking for a job.

213
00:14:59,724 --> 00:15:01,489
I don’t think I can do it, Bro.

214
00:15:03,617 --> 00:15:06,514
You don’t have to do anything.
Just observe.

215
00:15:06,539 --> 00:15:07,786
Drinks on me.

216
00:15:08,165 --> 00:15:11,500
You know my weakness.

217
00:15:12,801 --> 00:15:13,897
Cheers!

218
00:15:19,898 --> 00:15:22,578
Ma is getting old.

219
00:15:23,119 --> 00:15:25,137
Help me give her
a better life than this.

220
00:15:29,642 --> 00:15:31,269
I want that for her too.

221
00:15:35,439 --> 00:15:37,879
But before I can help anyone,
I must help myself first.

222
00:15:54,109 --> 00:15:56,252
I haven’t cried in a long time.

223
00:15:57,884 --> 00:16:02,508
After I buried my father,
I vowed to never shed a tear again.

224
00:16:04,111 --> 00:16:05,776
I succeeded in doing that.

225
00:16:07,677 --> 00:16:09,890
My next goal was to become fearless.

226
00:16:11,759 --> 00:16:14,484
But every time I think
of my life with JC,

227
00:16:14,509 --> 00:16:16,479
I am frightened.

228
00:16:18,874 --> 00:16:21,277
I know how to fight
just to survive.

229
00:16:22,152 --> 00:16:25,046
I want to learn
how to fight to be happy.

230
00:17:42,519 --> 00:17:46,367
- Go help them.
- Check her out, man.

231
00:17:46,392 --> 00:17:47,406
I got this.

232
00:17:48,014 --> 00:17:49,814
Ma’am Celing, let me
carry that for you.

233
00:17:49,839 --> 00:17:52,050
- Thank you.
- Her daughter is so hot.

234
00:17:55,680 --> 00:17:56,960
Get in, Queenie.

235
00:17:58,077 --> 00:17:59,530
Wait a second.

236
00:18:00,438 --> 00:18:02,085
- No need, ma’am.
- Take it.

237
00:18:02,742 --> 00:18:04,140
Thanks!

238
00:18:04,165 --> 00:18:05,542
Boss, take care of these two!

239
00:18:05,836 --> 00:18:07,921
Our fare.

240
00:18:09,163 --> 00:18:10,915
Two, sir.

241
00:18:26,726 --> 00:18:31,940
What’s wrong, young lady?

242
00:18:31,965 --> 00:18:35,599
I will help you.

243
00:18:36,845 --> 00:18:40,598
Who did this to you?
Come with me.

244
00:19:06,099 --> 00:19:07,851
Please! Stop it!

245
00:19:07,876 --> 00:19:09,461
Enough! I beg you, stop!

246
00:19:09,486 --> 00:19:12,364
I beg you, stop.

247
00:19:15,967 --> 00:19:17,493
Berto!

248
00:19:17,917 --> 00:19:19,418
Berto!

249
00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:21,139
My God!

250
00:19:24,134 --> 00:19:26,345
Help us!

251
00:19:27,033 --> 00:19:29,077
Help my husband!

252
00:19:39,308 --> 00:19:41,852
I can go with you and help.

253
00:19:41,916 --> 00:19:45,162
It’s okay.
Queenie and I manage quite well.

254
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:47,723
You can help me with the laundry
if you like.

255
00:19:47,810 --> 00:19:48,936
Tonight?

256
00:19:48,961 --> 00:19:50,004
Yes.

257
00:19:50,652 --> 00:19:52,302
Why do you do it at night?

258
00:19:52,478 --> 00:19:54,522
The water pressure is stronger.

259
00:19:55,166 --> 00:20:01,404
Have you and JC made plans?
I wish you’d stay for good.

260
00:20:01,708 --> 00:20:05,881
I’ll start looking for a job.
I used to work at a thrift shop in Baguio.

261
00:20:06,597 --> 00:20:09,308
Do you know someone
who might need a salesgirl?

262
00:20:11,034 --> 00:20:13,245
I’ll ask around.

263
00:20:13,900 --> 00:20:16,111
But you know what?

264
00:20:16,635 --> 00:20:22,818
I’ve been saving up
for a small space.

265
00:20:22,967 --> 00:20:26,114
We can turn it into a cafeteria.
You can help me run it.

266
00:20:26,139 --> 00:20:28,505
I also want to look for a job.
Anywhere.

267
00:20:28,530 --> 00:20:29,723
We can look together.

268
00:20:29,748 --> 00:20:33,756
Forget it, Josie.

269
00:20:33,785 --> 00:20:38,081
Do as your husband says
so there’s no trouble.

270
00:20:38,579 --> 00:20:39,705
Trouble?

271
00:20:40,120 --> 00:20:42,279
Pau doesn’t want me to work.

272
00:20:42,451 --> 00:20:45,584
He wants me at home.
He takes care of everything.

273
00:20:45,721 --> 00:20:47,490
He’s so old-fashioned.

274
00:20:50,029 --> 00:20:51,310
My man’s up.

275
00:20:58,011 --> 00:21:02,099
Rise and shine, bro.
Moon’s up.

276
00:21:02,564 --> 00:21:04,274
Come on.

277
00:21:10,384 --> 00:21:12,173
Good morning, everyone.

278
00:21:12,198 --> 00:21:13,996
It’s almost nighttime, stupid.

279
00:21:16,561 --> 00:21:17,729
Ma.

280
00:21:18,163 --> 00:21:20,246
JC, your breath stinks.

281
00:21:25,174 --> 00:21:26,581
There’s my cassava cake.

282
00:21:26,642 --> 00:21:28,060
Want coffee with that?

283
00:21:28,085 --> 00:21:32,605
Take a nap, Queenie.
I’ll wake you up when it’s time to go.

284
00:21:40,101 --> 00:21:43,722
Queenie, sleep on the bed.
Don't sleep on the floor.

285
00:21:44,303 --> 00:21:47,668
She can't lie down
where a man has just slept.

286
00:21:47,999 --> 00:21:50,574
It’s only Ma’s scent
that she’s used to.

287
00:21:52,272 --> 00:21:55,332
Eat something before your nap.

288
00:21:55,543 --> 00:21:56,543
Come on.

289
00:22:00,577 --> 00:22:01,683
Thank you.

290
00:22:02,729 --> 00:22:03,916
Thank you, love.

291
00:22:04,025 --> 00:22:05,205
Are we out of spoons?

292
00:22:10,913 --> 00:22:13,708
Bro, come with me
to the bar, okay?

293
00:22:15,222 --> 00:22:16,390
Is it okay if I go with him?

294
00:22:16,648 --> 00:22:18,817
I’m fine with everything as long
as you steer clear of trouble.

295
00:22:19,283 --> 00:22:20,409
I will.

296
00:22:20,434 --> 00:22:22,337
But tell trouble
to steer clear of me too.

297
00:22:22,362 --> 00:22:23,845
- Good morning Ma.
- Brush your teeth first.

298
00:22:23,870 --> 00:22:25,025
Do you need money?

299
00:22:25,050 --> 00:22:28,783
No. Pau's got me.

300
00:22:29,392 --> 00:22:31,282
- Pau!
- What?

301
00:22:31,307 --> 00:22:32,478
I'm coming with you!

302
00:22:39,188 --> 00:22:40,249
Jun!

303
00:22:41,913 --> 00:22:42,998
Bro!

304
00:22:44,562 --> 00:22:48,023
This is my brother JC.
JC, Jun.

305
00:22:48,770 --> 00:22:50,689
He’s quite a looker, Pau.

306
00:22:50,714 --> 00:22:52,090
Are you going to be a rent boy too?

307
00:22:52,115 --> 00:22:55,016
Easy, man. He’s new to this.

308
00:22:55,041 --> 00:22:58,148
Newbies are always a hit
with gays.

309
00:22:58,551 --> 00:23:00,345
Ever done it with a gay?

310
00:23:00,603 --> 00:23:02,021
No, I haven’t.

311
00:23:04,362 --> 00:23:05,697
They pay a premium for that.

312
00:23:05,939 --> 00:23:08,316
They have a nose for freshness.

313
00:23:09,858 --> 00:23:11,317
Teach him the ropes.

314
00:23:11,725 --> 00:23:15,643
I want him to work with us
so I can keep an eye on him.

315
00:23:16,020 --> 00:23:19,827
I'm an adult,
but he treats me like a child!

316
00:23:20,328 --> 00:23:25,041
Sorry, bro, my bad.
I meant, so we can be together.

317
00:23:26,167 --> 00:23:27,335
Whatever.

318
00:23:27,753 --> 00:23:30,381
Pineapple juice for me.

319
00:23:30,881 --> 00:23:34,301
Fresh milk for me. JC?

320
00:23:34,326 --> 00:23:35,522
Soda.

321
00:23:54,562 --> 00:23:55,772
Here you go, sir.

322
00:23:56,542 --> 00:23:57,835
Thank you.

323
00:23:58,923 --> 00:24:02,218
You have a client.
The pineapple juice gave you away.

324
00:24:02,243 --> 00:24:04,624
You know me so well.
You're right.

325
00:24:06,476 --> 00:24:08,562
What does pineapple juice
have to do with that?

326
00:24:10,190 --> 00:24:11,615
It increases the volume
of sperm upon orgasm.

327
00:24:11,640 --> 00:24:12,640
What?

328
00:24:13,890 --> 00:24:19,702
Those who swallow
love to choke on it.

329
00:24:19,898 --> 00:24:23,401
They can’t get enough.
It’s a good and cheap investment.

330
00:24:23,433 --> 00:24:26,227
That’s my first tip for you.

331
00:24:28,249 --> 00:24:30,865
Come with me.

332
00:24:31,702 --> 00:24:34,570
My clients are a rich couple.

333
00:24:34,595 --> 00:24:37,789
For three hours, we get
eight thousand each.

334
00:24:37,929 --> 00:24:40,395
Easy money, short time.

335
00:24:41,008 --> 00:24:42,093
Game.

336
00:24:42,288 --> 00:24:45,114
But before we go,
let’s get up onstage and get some tips.

337
00:24:45,708 --> 00:24:51,138
Hello bitches, bitchboys,
and bitchballs!

338
00:24:51,459 --> 00:24:54,504
Sorry to say bitchballs
account for majority!

339
00:24:55,213 --> 00:24:56,919
- George!
- Bro!

340
00:24:57,046 --> 00:24:58,631
Buddy! Bro!

341
00:24:58,656 --> 00:25:03,005
This is JC, my brother.

342
00:25:04,209 --> 00:25:07,001
Again, trans women are women,

343
00:25:07,026 --> 00:25:11,122
trans men are men.
So my sis here is a woman.

344
00:25:11,388 --> 00:25:20,628
[chattering]

345
00:25:20,700 --> 00:25:23,582
- Go ahead and entertain your client.
- Seriously?

346
00:25:23,607 --> 00:25:25,045
Smile!

347
00:25:25,178 --> 00:25:26,785
Mama Chester!

348
00:25:26,810 --> 00:25:29,671
Hello, son, hello!

349
00:25:29,696 --> 00:25:31,546
This is my brother JC.

350
00:25:33,787 --> 00:25:37,944
I sniff arrogance.
That’s easy to solve.

351
00:25:37,969 --> 00:25:40,096
Wanna work here?

352
00:25:42,068 --> 00:25:43,342
I don’t know.

353
00:25:43,398 --> 00:25:47,303
When you’re broke, you’ll know.

354
00:25:50,538 --> 00:25:52,078
Do you carry a big stick?

355
00:25:52,103 --> 00:25:56,967
Oh no, don’t act the virgin.

356
00:25:57,025 --> 00:26:00,036
Some customers actually like it
when you play hard to get.

357
00:26:00,061 --> 00:26:04,466
But most find it a turn-off.

358
00:26:04,491 --> 00:26:07,135
You, go backstage and get ready.
The show’s about to start.

359
00:26:07,160 --> 00:26:08,453
Stay here.

360
00:26:08,478 --> 00:26:11,796
Don’t let Mama Chester fool you,
she’s actually a sweetheart.

361
00:26:12,582 --> 00:26:14,542
Did you have to scare him?

362
00:26:15,171 --> 00:26:16,628
Are you okay?

363
00:26:16,653 --> 00:26:19,047
Your brother is a nice guy.

364
00:26:19,303 --> 00:26:24,444
But in this line of work,
freshness trumps niceness.

365
00:26:24,469 --> 00:26:28,053
You’re as fresh as a sunrise.

366
00:26:28,078 --> 00:26:33,292
Pau is closer to sunset.

367
00:26:34,482 --> 00:26:40,989
Can I start by sitting with
customers and nothing more?

368
00:26:41,014 --> 00:26:44,100
Just sit with customers?
You mean like a welcome committee?

369
00:26:44,270 --> 00:26:46,731
Oh no, in here, you have
to be ready for anything.

370
00:26:46,756 --> 00:26:52,366
I’m a connoisseur
when it comes to men.

371
00:26:52,889 --> 00:26:58,853
I sense that you’re a good guy at heart,
but you have a temper.

372
00:26:58,878 --> 00:27:01,592
Listen, this is important.

373
00:27:01,996 --> 00:27:06,764
Not everyone here wants sex.

374
00:27:06,943 --> 00:27:11,448
Some are here for more than that.
Don’t forget this.

375
00:27:11,474 --> 00:27:13,342
Okay, enjoy!

376
00:27:13,772 --> 00:27:14,825
See you around.

377
00:27:14,850 --> 00:27:17,438
How are you, sis?

378
00:27:17,463 --> 00:27:21,276
That crown looks too heavy
for your pretty little head.

379
00:27:21,301 --> 00:27:25,221
It looks expensive, take good care of it.
Okay, enjoy!

380
00:27:41,796 --> 00:27:44,731
- Thank you for eating!
- Two orders of rice and pork stew.

381
00:27:44,756 --> 00:27:46,634
- Dine-in?
- Yes, ma’am.

382
00:27:46,659 --> 00:27:47,756
Here, ma’am.

383
00:27:48,428 --> 00:27:49,522
Thank you.

384
00:27:50,431 --> 00:27:52,413
Ma'am Celing.

385
00:27:52,438 --> 00:27:55,159
Two macaroni soup
with egg, take out.

386
00:27:55,184 --> 00:27:56,352
Okay.

387
00:27:56,377 --> 00:27:58,880
- Okay, got it. Yours is pork stew?
- Yes, ma’am.

388
00:28:01,307 --> 00:28:04,843
I once caught JC
with a woman.

389
00:28:05,905 --> 00:28:08,149
Must’ve been a big fight.

390
00:28:08,518 --> 00:28:10,485
No, we’re not into that.

391
00:28:11,114 --> 00:28:12,612
We talked.

392
00:28:14,594 --> 00:28:15,959
He said it was lust, nothing more.

393
00:28:16,042 --> 00:28:19,953
I said that if they were doing it regularly
then it's a relationship.

394
00:28:20,746 --> 00:28:22,039
He’s a man, he said.

395
00:28:22,064 --> 00:28:23,883
Rub it a little and it gets hard.

396
00:28:24,063 --> 00:28:27,919
And a real man,
he said, doesn’t back down.

397
00:28:28,337 --> 00:28:30,964
I wanted to hit him
for giving me that bullshit reason.

398
00:28:31,865 --> 00:28:33,543
What did you do?

399
00:28:34,384 --> 00:28:37,804
JC listens as long as you’re calm.

400
00:28:38,678 --> 00:28:41,391
I asked him if he liked it
when I get hurt by his actions.

401
00:28:41,717 --> 00:28:43,260
He said no.

402
00:28:43,651 --> 00:28:47,397
I told him it would hurt me
if he did it again.

403
00:28:48,004 --> 00:28:52,193
He thought about it
and looked at me.

404
00:28:52,647 --> 00:28:54,976
I could see the sadness in his eyes.

405
00:28:56,118 --> 00:28:58,617
He embraced me
and then he said sorry.

406
00:28:58,946 --> 00:29:00,493
He promised he’d never do it again.

407
00:29:01,093 --> 00:29:02,579
Like a scene from a movie.

408
00:29:05,004 --> 00:29:08,616
He’s both a man and a child.
It’s not hard to read him.

409
00:29:09,045 --> 00:29:10,517
Except for the mood swings.

410
00:29:11,812 --> 00:29:13,606
How many boyfriends
did you have before Pau?

411
00:29:15,031 --> 00:29:16,908
He’s the only man I’ve loved.

412
00:29:16,949 --> 00:29:18,075
Wow, really?

413
00:29:18,100 --> 00:29:19,350
Yes, really.

414
00:29:19,577 --> 00:29:21,204
And you’re the only one he’s loved?

415
00:29:21,229 --> 00:29:22,682
The only woman?

416
00:29:24,131 --> 00:29:26,769
- Yes.
- Huh? What do you mean?

417
00:29:52,510 --> 00:29:54,595
Hello, Mommy.

418
00:29:54,595 --> 00:29:56,139
- You’re here early!
- Of course!

419
00:29:56,139 --> 00:30:00,897
- Nice to meet you.
- I’ll leave you two here, okay?

420
00:30:00,922 --> 00:30:01,942
Okay.

421
00:30:01,967 --> 00:30:05,053
Enjoy, thank you.

422
00:30:05,078 --> 00:30:06,830
Beer or hard?

423
00:30:07,128 --> 00:30:08,338
Beer.

424
00:30:08,460 --> 00:30:09,616
Waiter!

425
00:30:26,621 --> 00:30:28,827
JC, you’re new here?

426
00:30:29,105 --> 00:30:30,106
Yes, sir.

427
00:30:30,769 --> 00:30:32,181
You’re Pau’s brother?

428
00:30:32,612 --> 00:30:33,947
Yes, sir.

429
00:30:35,795 --> 00:30:37,922
Are you as good as him?

430
00:30:40,877 --> 00:30:42,636
I have no experience.

431
00:30:43,076 --> 00:30:45,348
Are you saying that
to jack up your price?

432
00:30:47,540 --> 00:30:50,293
I’m reasonable.
How much do you want?

433
00:30:50,388 --> 00:30:52,069
One time, big time.

434
00:30:53,624 --> 00:30:55,907
Sorry too. I’m also quite frank.

435
00:30:56,055 --> 00:31:00,684
I’m not ready for what you want.

436
00:31:01,234 --> 00:31:03,194
Thanks for the beer.

437
00:31:06,459 --> 00:31:08,544
Excuse me, I’ll be back.

438
00:31:27,315 --> 00:31:28,399
New?

439
00:31:31,605 --> 00:31:32,606
What?

440
00:31:33,543 --> 00:31:35,248
You’re a stripper?

441
00:31:38,186 --> 00:31:39,283
No.

442
00:31:40,284 --> 00:31:41,654
Not yet.

443
00:31:43,067 --> 00:31:46,696
I’m Liza. I dance next door.

444
00:31:49,128 --> 00:31:51,741
Did you know that you men are
more expensive than us women?

445
00:31:52,293 --> 00:31:53,544
Really?

446
00:31:54,785 --> 00:31:58,623
Your star performer earns much more
than our star performer.

447
00:31:58,716 --> 00:32:01,927
Even a has-been male stripper
makes more than we do.

448
00:32:02,137 --> 00:32:06,710
Our has-beens get zero, zilch, nada.

449
00:32:07,031 --> 00:32:08,449
I have a theory.

450
00:32:08,474 --> 00:32:10,225
Gay men are richer.

451
00:32:11,576 --> 00:32:13,585
Or they’re alone in life.

452
00:32:13,795 --> 00:32:15,935
They have more disposable income

453
00:32:15,960 --> 00:32:18,065
than straight men who are just
as horny but have families to feed.

454
00:32:18,963 --> 00:32:21,968
Also, gay men tend
to be drama queens

455
00:32:21,993 --> 00:32:24,823
and they’re willing to pay good money
to keep up their fantasies.

456
00:32:26,101 --> 00:32:27,519
Maybe that’s it.

457
00:32:27,628 --> 00:32:29,785
We women are just itch removers basically.

458
00:32:30,247 --> 00:32:32,079
We don’t exist outside of bed.

459
00:32:35,952 --> 00:32:37,620
Do I talk too much?

460
00:32:37,721 --> 00:32:39,406
I’m usually not talkative,
actually the opposite.

461
00:32:39,431 --> 00:32:41,678
Maybe I’m nervous
because I like you.

462
00:32:43,271 --> 00:32:44,564
That wasn’t a joke.

463
00:32:44,589 --> 00:32:47,386
I’m the star performer next door.
They pay me well.

464
00:32:48,389 --> 00:32:52,648
Once in a while,
I like to do the paying.

465
00:32:53,844 --> 00:32:55,846
Game?

466
00:32:56,140 --> 00:32:57,897
I’m not a rent boy.

467
00:33:00,230 --> 00:33:03,235
Fine, let’s get you drunk first.
What do you want to drink?

468
00:33:04,964 --> 00:33:07,133
Aren’t they looking for you onstage?

469
00:33:07,490 --> 00:33:09,043
I can have a beer.

470
00:33:10,902 --> 00:33:13,321
Boss! Two beers.

471
00:33:28,873 --> 00:33:31,476
Hey! Go home!

472
00:33:31,788 --> 00:33:33,207
Don’t be afraid.

473
00:33:38,462 --> 00:33:39,499
Ma'am.

474
00:33:39,827 --> 00:33:40,933
Sir?

475
00:33:40,958 --> 00:33:42,418
Pork stew, rice, soup.

476
00:33:42,525 --> 00:33:44,202
Okay, sir.

477
00:33:49,952 --> 00:33:52,724
He never pays.
What did you expect, he’s a cop.

478
00:33:52,749 --> 00:33:55,030
Let’s have some cassava cake
before we sleep.

479
00:33:55,055 --> 00:33:57,171
Should we wait for Ma and Queenie?

480
00:33:57,241 --> 00:33:58,367
No.

481
00:33:58,817 --> 00:34:00,960
They won’t be home
'til the crack of dawn.

482
00:34:02,165 --> 00:34:03,588
What about Pau and JC?

483
00:34:03,941 --> 00:34:09,321
That depends on how busy the bar is.
If it’s slow they’ll be here by 4 or 5 AM.

484
00:34:10,131 --> 00:34:14,932
Sometimes Pau would
pick up Ma and Queenie.

485
00:34:15,924 --> 00:34:20,085
If a customer takes him out,

486
00:34:20,110 --> 00:34:22,866
he’ll be back much later.

487
00:34:22,891 --> 00:34:24,610
Sometimes at lunchtime.

488
00:34:25,717 --> 00:34:28,404
I hope you won’t mind me
asking you this.

489
00:34:29,689 --> 00:34:32,658
It's fine. We’re family.

490
00:34:33,491 --> 00:34:35,201
What do you want to know?

491
00:34:35,474 --> 00:34:40,583
How do you feel when he comes home at noon
knowing he’s had sex with someone?

492
00:34:42,827 --> 00:34:44,427
I don’t feel anything anymore.

493
00:34:45,249 --> 00:34:46,922
It’s just a job.

494
00:34:47,653 --> 00:34:52,345
Nothing that a shower
and good soap can’t wash away.

495
00:34:52,756 --> 00:34:54,228
It’s like it never happened.

496
00:35:27,534 --> 00:35:29,119
Her name’s Maritess.

497
00:35:29,943 --> 00:35:31,311
Pretty name.

498
00:35:32,075 --> 00:35:34,745
Maria Teresa.

499
00:35:35,485 --> 00:35:37,056
Sounds like a saint.

500
00:35:38,167 --> 00:35:40,545
Maria Teresita.

501
00:35:41,019 --> 00:35:42,895
Little saint.

502
00:35:44,402 --> 00:35:45,983
She’s no saint,

503
00:35:46,258 --> 00:35:48,552
but she’s kind.

504
00:35:48,714 --> 00:35:50,216
Beautiful.

505
00:35:50,786 --> 00:35:52,246
And she loves me.

506
00:35:53,796 --> 00:35:55,825
She’s lucky to have you.

507
00:35:59,626 --> 00:36:01,872
Liza’s not my real name.

508
00:36:02,868 --> 00:36:06,622
It’s Rebecca.

509
00:36:07,118 --> 00:36:08,879
Pretty nice too, right?

510
00:36:09,811 --> 00:36:15,400
I was named after my grandmother,
that’s why I don’t use it for work.

511
00:36:15,697 --> 00:36:16,948
Why “Liza?"

512
00:36:16,973 --> 00:36:18,722
When I was a little girl,

513
00:36:19,284 --> 00:36:21,483
they shaved my head completely bald.

514
00:36:21,578 --> 00:36:26,546
It was full of lice.
Get it?

515
00:36:35,538 --> 00:36:36,664
Don't test me.

516
00:37:10,781 --> 00:37:12,366
Stop.

517
00:37:14,232 --> 00:37:15,942
What’s wrong?

518
00:37:16,996 --> 00:37:18,581
Sorry.

519
00:37:19,085 --> 00:37:21,004
I made a promise to Maritess.

520
00:39:04,567 --> 00:39:07,361
Did you get bored?

521
00:39:07,386 --> 00:39:08,601
I’m okay.

522
00:39:15,045 --> 00:39:17,882
A little spending money
for you.

523
00:39:18,054 --> 00:39:19,472
Thanks, bro.

524
00:39:20,111 --> 00:39:22,613
I’ll pay you back
when I find a job.

525
00:39:22,814 --> 00:39:23,940
Jackass!

526
00:39:23,965 --> 00:39:26,926
From the time we were kids,
I’ve never collected

527
00:39:27,049 --> 00:39:29,051
and you’ve never offered.

528
00:39:29,357 --> 00:39:32,193
I know. Just had to say it.
To lessen the guilt.

529
00:39:32,218 --> 00:39:33,725
Let’s eat.

530
00:39:33,750 --> 00:39:34,827
Ah!

531
00:39:57,099 --> 00:40:01,194
Have pity on me, Pa. Stop.

532
00:40:01,219 --> 00:40:04,663
Pa. Stop.

533
00:40:05,178 --> 00:40:08,667
Have pity on me. Please stop…

534
00:40:08,692 --> 00:40:12,739
Pa. Stop, please stop…

535
00:40:12,764 --> 00:40:16,460
Please stop…

536
00:40:16,485 --> 00:40:17,632
Queenie…

537
00:40:18,661 --> 00:40:19,954
Queenie.

538
00:40:20,149 --> 00:40:21,526
Queenie.

539
00:40:22,473 --> 00:40:24,391
Queenie.

540
00:40:28,130 --> 00:40:34,860
There, there.

541
00:40:49,042 --> 00:40:52,121
It will be okay.

542
00:40:53,211 --> 00:40:55,874
I haven’t had anything this good
in a long time.

543
00:40:56,811 --> 00:40:59,480
Maritess and I are on a tight budget.

544
00:41:00,663 --> 00:41:02,511
She’s good at handling money.

545
00:41:03,931 --> 00:41:05,253
That’s a good thing.

546
00:41:05,314 --> 00:41:07,066
We need to save up.

547
00:41:07,376 --> 00:41:09,462
Josie’s the same.

548
00:41:09,930 --> 00:41:15,269
I want to grow our savings
before I leave.

549
00:41:16,130 --> 00:41:17,266
Where are you going?

550
00:41:18,452 --> 00:41:21,734
You’re the first one I’m telling
so keep it between us.

551
00:41:22,524 --> 00:41:24,359
Remember Allan?

552
00:41:25,256 --> 00:41:27,323
Your client who became your lover?

553
00:41:27,721 --> 00:41:29,194
He’s in America, right?

554
00:41:29,247 --> 00:41:30,957
We stayed in touch.

555
00:41:30,982 --> 00:41:33,317
Josie doesn’t know.

556
00:41:33,673 --> 00:41:38,334
He’s bringing me to the US to marry me
so I can have a green card.

557
00:42:22,134 --> 00:42:23,671
Hungry?

558
00:42:42,237 --> 00:42:43,322
Have you eaten?

559
00:42:43,322 --> 00:42:44,615
Yes.

560
00:42:55,851 --> 00:42:57,538
Keep it, it's yours.

561
00:42:57,825 --> 00:43:00,994
Give this to Ma.

562
00:43:01,535 --> 00:43:04,558
I have some chocolate for Queenie.

563
00:43:07,162 --> 00:43:08,423
Give it to her.

564
00:43:33,593 --> 00:43:34,909
How was your day?

565
00:43:35,907 --> 00:43:37,737
Your family is good to me.

566
00:43:38,045 --> 00:43:39,788
Don’t you want us to stay?

567
00:43:41,380 --> 00:43:42,708
You know me.

568
00:43:43,599 --> 00:43:47,436
I won’t stop until I get even with those
who’ve done me wrong.

569
00:43:48,629 --> 00:43:50,464
And you know I’ll stop you.

570
00:43:51,218 --> 00:43:52,260
Yes.

571
00:43:52,994 --> 00:43:55,554
But you know that I’m just waiting
for the right time to strike.

572
00:44:00,651 --> 00:44:03,395
What do you think
of Pau’s workplace?

573
00:44:04,111 --> 00:44:05,147
It’s okay.

574
00:44:05,901 --> 00:44:07,774
A different breed of people, for a change.

575
00:44:09,525 --> 00:44:11,902
Do you want to work there?

576
00:44:13,443 --> 00:44:14,861
Maybe.

577
00:44:16,422 --> 00:44:17,617
Maybe.

578
00:44:18,229 --> 00:44:22,066
I can do the chitchat
and maybe a little dancing.

579
00:44:24,756 --> 00:44:26,508
Get some sleep.

580
00:44:28,314 --> 00:44:29,755
I’ll just take a bath.

581
00:44:50,449 --> 00:44:54,244
Twilight

582
00:44:55,620 --> 00:45:00,150
Happy birthday, Ma. Love you.

583
00:45:00,175 --> 00:45:01,418
You need mouthwash.

584
00:45:01,418 --> 00:45:03,128
I’ll give Ma her gift later.

585
00:45:03,153 --> 00:45:04,863
For you, Queenie.

586
00:45:05,353 --> 00:45:08,168
Buy a new dress,
even if it's not your birthday.

587
00:45:08,506 --> 00:45:09,590
Oh, also for you—

588
00:45:09,615 --> 00:45:11,714
Bought it from someone at work.

589
00:45:12,237 --> 00:45:13,447
It’s real silver.

590
00:45:13,472 --> 00:45:15,782
So beautiful.

591
00:45:15,807 --> 00:45:16,825
Come, Queenie.

592
00:45:16,850 --> 00:45:18,847
Let me put it on you.

593
00:45:18,894 --> 00:45:21,288
Hey! Haven’t you taken a bath yet?

594
00:45:21,313 --> 00:45:25,870
- Get dressed JC, we’ll be late already.
- Where’s Pau?

595
00:45:26,276 --> 00:45:28,753
Five months of peace and quiet.

596
00:45:29,237 --> 00:45:30,659
JC’s mother is right.

597
00:45:30,797 --> 00:45:35,510
Don’t mind the noise, stay in your lane,
focus on your own life and dreams

598
00:45:35,535 --> 00:45:37,214
and you will get somewhere.

599
00:45:37,268 --> 00:45:38,394
I’m happy here.

600
00:45:38,497 --> 00:45:40,082
They’re my family now.

601
00:45:40,657 --> 00:45:43,952
Ma's this close
to getting her own space for the eatery.

602
00:45:43,977 --> 00:45:47,198
Pau is about to redeem
the family property in the province.

603
00:45:47,544 --> 00:45:49,713
He and Josie
have managed to save up quite a lot.

604
00:45:49,759 --> 00:45:52,386
No wonder they don’t buy new things.

605
00:45:53,464 --> 00:45:57,275
I’ve started saving too,
ever since JC went to to work with Pau.

606
00:45:57,300 --> 00:46:00,322
Not much though,
because JC doesn’t go out with customers.

607
00:46:00,347 --> 00:46:03,488
But JC brags he's the star dancer.

608
00:46:03,513 --> 00:46:05,599
This is our gift to you!

609
00:46:05,791 --> 00:46:06,792
Really?

610
00:46:06,851 --> 00:46:09,686
We've paid half already!

611
00:46:09,711 --> 00:46:12,556
Just one more year
and it’s fully paid.

612
00:46:12,581 --> 00:46:14,172
You've made so happy.

613
00:46:14,197 --> 00:46:17,534
What about your plans?

614
00:46:17,761 --> 00:46:20,680
Don’t worry.
There’s enough left in our savings.

615
00:46:20,705 --> 00:46:24,267
If you knew how much,
you’d borrow money from us.

616
00:46:24,292 --> 00:46:26,436
No way! Stop joking around.

617
00:46:26,461 --> 00:46:29,272
Are Josie and Maritess okay with this?

618
00:46:29,297 --> 00:46:32,839
Ma, this has been our plan all along.

619
00:46:32,864 --> 00:46:33,944
Really?

620
00:46:33,969 --> 00:46:36,822
JC and I contributed a little.
Josie and Pau’s share is much bigger.

621
00:46:36,847 --> 00:46:40,600
- My sons are the best!
- We’re so happy for you.

622
00:46:40,625 --> 00:46:43,316
Happy birthday, Ma.

623
00:47:17,137 --> 00:47:19,723
Are you okay, bro?
Did you have fun?

624
00:47:21,482 --> 00:47:23,216
Bro, cheers.

625
00:47:23,730 --> 00:47:25,668
I thought you’d avoid me.

626
00:47:27,789 --> 00:47:29,624
Sorry about last time.

627
00:47:30,600 --> 00:47:32,270
You left me hanging.

628
00:47:33,494 --> 00:47:36,288
We can be friends.

629
00:47:37,073 --> 00:47:39,117
We can be that, outside.

630
00:47:39,281 --> 00:47:42,951
Here I want to be your customer.
In case you change your mind.

631
00:47:45,375 --> 00:47:49,504
There’s so many here.
Want me to help you choose?

632
00:47:51,796 --> 00:47:54,591
The chase thrills me.

633
00:47:54,979 --> 00:47:57,458
I know you don’t go out
with your customers.

634
00:47:59,442 --> 00:48:01,224
Why can’t I be the exception?

635
00:48:01,480 --> 00:48:05,234
Even though it's been used,
mine still smells good, you know!

636
00:48:15,028 --> 00:48:17,447
Hey, I’m still here.

637
00:48:17,567 --> 00:48:20,195
I said, I’m a good customer.

638
00:48:20,220 --> 00:48:23,034
I know you’re tired
so I’ll do all the work.

639
00:48:24,854 --> 00:48:26,356
I’m a man.

640
00:48:26,719 --> 00:48:28,737
You make me horny.

641
00:48:30,096 --> 00:48:32,963
But that’s all there is…

642
00:48:32,988 --> 00:48:34,349
I’ll take that.

643
00:48:36,161 --> 00:48:38,002
No feelings.

644
00:48:38,144 --> 00:48:40,105
I just want to taste you.

645
00:48:41,523 --> 00:48:44,067
We all taste the same.

646
00:48:44,138 --> 00:48:45,473
Wrong.

647
00:48:46,072 --> 00:48:49,862
I’m sure yours is sweeter.

648
00:49:56,212 --> 00:49:57,949
Hey.

649
00:49:59,400 --> 00:50:01,127
No need for that.

650
00:50:01,903 --> 00:50:04,465
Take it. I still earn
more than you do.

651
00:50:06,007 --> 00:50:09,212
I’ll stop paying
when you fall in love with me.

652
00:50:11,767 --> 00:50:12,848
Thanks.

653
00:50:13,055 --> 00:50:14,206
Thank you.

654
00:50:21,284 --> 00:50:24,065
Hey asshole!
What's your problem, huh?

655
00:50:25,460 --> 00:50:26,878
Maritess!

656
00:50:27,177 --> 00:50:29,298
JC is fighting with someone!

657
00:50:29,323 --> 00:50:30,330
What?

658
00:50:30,392 --> 00:50:32,135
Pau! Wake up!

659
00:50:32,277 --> 00:50:36,478
Your brother’s in a fight.

660
00:50:36,503 --> 00:50:37,545
Hold on.

661
00:50:48,104 --> 00:50:50,448
Bro, stop it!
Enough! Bro!

662
00:50:50,473 --> 00:50:51,849
JC!

663
00:50:51,874 --> 00:50:56,796
Screw you!
Stop tripping on Queenie!

664
00:50:56,821 --> 00:50:58,906
She’s a child! You pervert!

665
00:50:58,931 --> 00:51:03,034
Let go of me!
I’m defending our sister’s honor!

666
00:51:03,059 --> 00:51:07,676
They have no respect.
I’m defending Queenie.

667
00:51:07,701 --> 00:51:09,828
I'm tired of all of this.

668
00:51:09,853 --> 00:51:11,979
You always have an excuse.

669
00:51:15,112 --> 00:51:16,726
Stop it!

670
00:51:16,751 --> 00:51:20,042
- We were just talking.
- Asshole!

671
00:51:20,067 --> 00:51:23,957
So what if we find your sister sexy?

672
00:51:23,982 --> 00:51:28,479
So what if we jack off
thinking of her naked?

673
00:51:28,504 --> 00:51:31,334
Let’s settle this at the town hall.

674
00:51:31,359 --> 00:51:33,073
We’ll follow.

675
00:52:04,507 --> 00:52:05,842
Is Pau home?

676
00:52:05,905 --> 00:52:07,725
What’s this about, sir?

677
00:52:11,899 --> 00:52:13,041
Josie?

678
00:52:14,175 --> 00:52:15,468
I’m Allan.

679
00:52:24,500 --> 00:52:27,231
Pau never mentioned it.

680
00:52:32,214 --> 00:52:36,950
Sorry if I had to be the one
to break it to you.

681
00:52:38,836 --> 00:52:43,123
Don’t worry.
You’re in our plans.

682
00:52:45,036 --> 00:52:47,111
But first we have
to get married in the US.

683
00:52:49,694 --> 00:52:50,942
That’s allowed?

684
00:52:53,219 --> 00:52:54,342
It’s legal there.

685
00:52:56,363 --> 00:52:59,556
It’s the fastest way
of getting Pau his papers.

686
00:53:00,823 --> 00:53:02,517
Once that’s out of the way...

687
00:53:05,438 --> 00:53:07,773
we’ll send for you and Ma.

688
00:53:13,524 --> 00:53:15,280
Pau is leaving me?

689
00:53:21,392 --> 00:53:22,463
Josie.

690
00:53:24,687 --> 00:53:26,083
Only in the beginning.

691
00:53:26,486 --> 00:53:27,834
How many months?

692
00:53:30,102 --> 00:53:32,797
Two or three years.

693
00:53:34,982 --> 00:53:36,759
Then we’ll get a divorce.

694
00:53:37,653 --> 00:53:42,051
He’ll come back here
and marry you.

695
00:53:42,763 --> 00:53:44,499
Then he can bring you there.

696
00:53:47,005 --> 00:53:49,189
Why are you taking Pau from us?

697
00:53:53,550 --> 00:53:57,190
You’re using America to lure him.

698
00:54:00,580 --> 00:54:02,326
Pau wants a new life.

699
00:54:03,826 --> 00:54:05,942
So you get to marry him
before I do.

700
00:54:08,936 --> 00:54:10,103
Josie.

701
00:54:14,345 --> 00:54:18,176
I hope you won’t deny him
this chance at a better life.

702
00:54:22,370 --> 00:54:24,057
Without your consent...

703
00:54:25,195 --> 00:54:27,455
we’re not going through with it.

704
00:54:29,912 --> 00:54:32,982
Have we been sharing Pau
all this time?

705
00:54:35,827 --> 00:54:37,737
Does he love you
more than he loves me?

706
00:54:42,501 --> 00:54:45,203
I can make sacrifices for Pau.

707
00:54:48,157 --> 00:54:53,503
But if after all this
I still end up losing him…

708
00:54:54,872 --> 00:54:57,799
That’s something I can’t take.

709
00:55:05,612 --> 00:55:07,205
[clamoring]

710
00:55:07,231 --> 00:55:11,899
I apologize on behalf of my son.
Please don’t file charges against him.

711
00:55:11,924 --> 00:55:14,822
What the heck!
Don’t plead with these assholes.

712
00:55:14,847 --> 00:55:18,667
JC, shut up!

713
00:55:19,110 --> 00:55:22,639
You’re just like your father.

714
00:55:22,664 --> 00:55:25,018
I thought I was done with all of this.

715
00:55:25,846 --> 00:55:33,401
I’m too old to be begging like this.

716
00:55:33,426 --> 00:55:36,129
Bro, for her sake, calm down.

717
00:55:38,348 --> 00:55:41,309
Listen for once!

718
00:55:44,495 --> 00:55:50,750
For your medicines.
I beg your forgiveness.

719
00:55:50,775 --> 00:55:55,924
You’re a saint, Ma’am Celing,
but your son is the devil.

720
00:55:57,282 --> 00:55:58,992
I’m your mother.

721
00:56:00,758 --> 00:56:06,495
No matter what you do,
I will never get tired of helping you.

722
00:56:11,534 --> 00:56:13,165
I’m really sorry.

723
00:56:16,313 --> 00:56:20,840
I can’t control my temper.

724
00:56:25,356 --> 00:56:26,888
Your father was the same.

725
00:56:29,253 --> 00:56:31,143
No amount of pleading from me
could tame him.

726
00:56:33,708 --> 00:56:35,855
I couldn't keep an eye
on him all the time.

727
00:56:38,004 --> 00:56:40,083
Many times we had to move...

728
00:56:41,784 --> 00:56:48,118
and each time
he’d find someone to fight with.

729
00:56:53,307 --> 00:56:59,421
Aren’t you tired of
my son yet, Maritess?

730
00:57:00,691 --> 00:57:02,609
I love him.

731
00:57:08,513 --> 00:57:10,265
I’m old.

732
00:57:14,241 --> 00:57:16,451
I pray for only one thing:

733
00:57:18,124 --> 00:57:26,734
a quiet life for all of us, together.

734
00:57:29,662 --> 00:57:32,704
This family is what keeps me going.

735
00:57:34,784 --> 00:57:37,630
I’m sorry, Ma,
but Pau has other plans.

736
00:57:43,322 --> 00:57:44,525
What plans, Pau?

737
00:58:14,233 --> 00:58:18,124
Allan is taking me to America.

738
00:58:19,384 --> 00:58:26,049
Once my papers are fixed,
I’ll file a petition for you and Josie.

739
00:58:31,962 --> 00:58:36,591
Are you okay with this, Josie?

740
00:58:52,328 --> 00:58:54,194
I’m trying my best to accept it.

741
00:59:10,635 --> 00:59:16,140
Queenie, finish what I’m doing.

742
00:59:16,765 --> 00:59:19,436
I left something at the store.

743
00:59:51,399 --> 00:59:52,997
I didn’t know you drank.

744
00:59:55,474 --> 00:59:59,253
My last drink was
when we buried JC’s father.

745
01:00:06,285 --> 01:00:08,787
Out of grief?

746
01:00:10,432 --> 01:00:11,530
Maybe.

747
01:00:13,172 --> 01:00:18,546
But also out of relief.
I didn’t have to worry about him anymore.

748
01:00:20,880 --> 01:00:24,333
I felt scared too.

749
01:00:25,129 --> 01:00:29,297
Suddenly I was left alone
to raise my sons.

750
01:00:31,350 --> 01:00:35,929
I guess I’m not sure
why anyone drinks.

751
01:00:45,130 --> 01:00:48,649
My last drink was the first night
JC and I became a couple.

752
01:00:48,832 --> 01:00:50,151
We were at a bar.

753
01:00:50,529 --> 01:00:55,907
I got so drunk that when JC got in a fight
I couldn’t stop him.

754
01:00:56,639 --> 01:00:58,653
Since then I swore off drinking.

755
01:01:01,581 --> 01:01:05,750
You suddenly realized
your calling as JC’s bodyguard.

756
01:01:08,634 --> 01:01:14,181
His own body-guardian angel.

757
01:02:22,236 --> 01:02:24,287
What’s your dream?

758
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:28,332
I love you, believe me.

759
01:02:30,470 --> 01:02:32,045
I believe you.

760
01:02:33,471 --> 01:02:36,048
But I also know you love him too.

761
01:02:39,360 --> 01:02:40,803
That’s different.

762
01:02:44,271 --> 01:02:47,352
Your other customers I don’t mind.

763
01:02:48,755 --> 01:02:51,772
It’s only your body
that we lend to them.

764
01:02:53,832 --> 01:02:56,861
That’s all they want,
that’s all they get.

765
01:02:57,676 --> 01:03:00,581
With Allan I have
to share your heart.

766
01:03:00,606 --> 01:03:02,700
Don’t think of it that way.

767
01:03:04,596 --> 01:03:07,015
How then?

768
01:03:07,550 --> 01:03:12,627
We need him
to improve our life.

769
01:03:18,247 --> 01:03:22,244
I know you. You play fair.

770
01:03:23,815 --> 01:03:28,017
Allan is only doing this because he can get
what he wants from you.

771
01:03:32,538 --> 01:03:34,404
What do you want me to do?

772
01:03:41,977 --> 01:03:43,896
I won’t stop you.

773
01:03:47,858 --> 01:03:52,115
Promise me we’ll grow old together.

774
01:03:53,828 --> 01:03:57,456
I promise, we'll grow old together.

775
01:03:58,451 --> 01:04:04,220
I want our children
to have a better life than this.

776
01:04:22,701 --> 01:04:26,584
- She was having a nightmare.
- Queenie.

777
01:04:27,365 --> 01:04:29,913
Queenie!

778
01:04:29,938 --> 01:04:30,938
Ouch!

779
01:04:32,225 --> 01:04:34,602
Damn that father of hers.

780
01:04:34,627 --> 01:04:37,459
Does he even know the pain
he’s caused Queenie?

781
01:04:37,484 --> 01:04:39,654
If I ever see that son of a bitch…

782
01:04:39,679 --> 01:04:42,069
Bro, calm down.

783
01:04:42,123 --> 01:04:45,694
Queenie! Queenie! Calm down!

784
01:04:48,319 --> 01:04:51,092
Calm down, Queenie.

785
01:05:17,775 --> 01:05:22,530
What if you open early
so you can come home before it gets late?

786
01:05:22,555 --> 01:05:28,240
No, we’re sticking
with dinner to early morning.

787
01:05:28,265 --> 01:05:30,640
My regulars will miss me.

788
01:05:30,925 --> 01:05:33,845
Pau has a point.
Why not start with breakfast?

789
01:05:33,916 --> 01:05:36,794
Breakfast time is slow!

790
01:05:36,819 --> 01:05:39,311
These days people get by
with only bread and coffee.

791
01:05:39,336 --> 01:05:40,965
Ma, we’re here!

792
01:05:40,990 --> 01:05:43,865
- Ma, we got you food warmers.
- Really?

793
01:05:44,208 --> 01:05:46,617
You did a great job with the place.

794
01:05:46,740 --> 01:05:49,848
Food warmers?
That’s so posh, Ma.

795
01:05:49,873 --> 01:05:50,666
You’re all set!

796
01:05:50,666 --> 01:05:53,686
JC insisted.
I told him I don’t need those.

797
01:05:53,711 --> 01:05:58,132
My customers are used to seeing my food
in old pots and pans.

798
01:05:58,157 --> 01:05:59,335
Looks yummy.

799
01:06:00,384 --> 01:06:02,694
Move, move, we’re about to open!

800
01:06:02,720 --> 01:06:09,368
Sir, the drugs must have been planted.

801
01:06:09,393 --> 01:06:11,608
Jun is no addict. I’ve known him
for a long time.

802
01:06:11,633 --> 01:06:12,938
Maybe you’re a dealer too.

803
01:06:12,963 --> 01:06:16,602
- No, sir. He’s a good kid!
- Let’s go.

804
01:06:18,876 --> 01:06:20,037
Jun?

805
01:06:21,322 --> 01:06:22,406
Sir?

806
01:06:30,385 --> 01:06:35,210
I know Jun is a user
but I didn't know he's selling too.

807
01:06:35,235 --> 01:06:37,104
They found half a kilo.

808
01:06:37,129 --> 01:06:41,340
That’s enough to put him away
until he rots.

809
01:06:41,451 --> 01:06:44,637
One of his patrons is well connected.
He’ll get out.

810
01:06:48,557 --> 01:06:50,434
Thanks again. You’re the best.

811
01:06:50,459 --> 01:06:53,566
Thank you Sir.

812
01:06:55,438 --> 01:06:59,557
Freeloader.
Just because he’s a cop.

813
01:06:59,847 --> 01:07:02,308
That’s life. Let it go.

814
01:07:02,333 --> 01:07:04,394
Have you ever tried
giving him the bill?

815
01:07:05,769 --> 01:07:08,504
The first time he ate my food,

816
01:07:08,707 --> 01:07:13,246
he smiled at me and nodded.
Then he left.

817
01:07:13,271 --> 01:07:16,027
Shameless.

818
01:07:18,885 --> 01:07:20,397
What if there’s a raid?

819
01:07:20,422 --> 01:07:23,949
Raid what?
Our thoroughly wholesome show?

820
01:07:23,974 --> 01:07:26,070
Putting on a beauty pageant?

821
01:07:26,095 --> 01:07:28,988
Staging a musical with skimpy costumes?
We’re all PG here.

822
01:07:29,105 --> 01:07:30,149
Poor guys?

823
01:07:30,174 --> 01:07:32,718
Parental guidance, stupid.

824
01:07:32,743 --> 01:07:35,329
What are you doing here?
Go inside and put on a show!

825
01:07:35,557 --> 01:07:39,230
I know you’re wondering
why I agreed to Pau’s plan.

826
01:07:39,255 --> 01:07:41,729
We each have our point of view.

827
01:07:43,806 --> 01:07:46,567
You wouldn’t allow it
if you were in my place.

828
01:07:47,845 --> 01:07:51,030
How can one heart be shared equally?

829
01:07:53,337 --> 01:07:56,834
I guess this life has taught me
not to expect my fair share.

830
01:07:58,303 --> 01:08:01,890
How can you be sure
that he’ll go back to you?

831
01:08:03,860 --> 01:08:06,154
Are you a hundred percent sure
with JC?

832
01:08:06,179 --> 01:08:09,548
No, but I’ve learned
to fight for him.

833
01:08:13,730 --> 01:08:16,233
Are you disappointed with me?

834
01:08:16,822 --> 01:08:19,866
No, Josie. I get it.

835
01:08:19,891 --> 01:08:24,188
You’re doing what you think you have to.
We’re the same.

836
01:08:26,376 --> 01:08:29,087
Sometimes I get tired.

837
01:08:30,372 --> 01:08:34,949
I've been holding on to the illusion
that Pau and I can have a normal life.

838
01:08:38,292 --> 01:08:40,965
JC, wait.

839
01:08:41,770 --> 01:08:47,735
I have customers asking about you.

840
01:08:47,760 --> 01:08:52,723
They’ll double the bar fine and you can
name your price, if you’ll do it with them.

841
01:08:53,747 --> 01:08:56,667
Sorry, Mama Chester,
I really don’t want to.

842
01:08:56,692 --> 01:08:58,762
What if it’s a woman?

843
01:08:59,898 --> 01:09:01,323
Still no.

844
01:09:01,348 --> 01:09:05,777
Then why did you do it
with that Liza next door?

845
01:09:05,941 --> 01:09:08,923
She’s just a friend.

846
01:09:08,948 --> 01:09:12,957
Friends with benefits?

847
01:09:13,302 --> 01:09:15,179
- You going onstage tonight?
- Yes, Mama Chester.

848
01:09:15,204 --> 01:09:18,056
You dance so well.

849
01:09:18,081 --> 01:09:21,877
They can’t get enough of you.

850
01:09:21,902 --> 01:09:27,324
Too bad they can only watch,
not taste. Except for Liza.

851
01:09:27,445 --> 01:09:31,848
Mama Chester, how can we help Jun?

852
01:09:35,162 --> 01:09:38,363
Don’t worry about him.
He has connections.

853
01:09:40,486 --> 01:09:42,058
How are you?

854
01:09:42,184 --> 01:09:45,535
- I'm fine.
- That's great. Okay, I'll go ahead.

855
01:09:59,915 --> 01:10:01,171
Liza, wait.

856
01:10:01,812 --> 01:10:02,851
Why?

857
01:10:02,876 --> 01:10:04,978
I’m Maritess, JC’s partner.

858
01:10:05,003 --> 01:10:06,953
So you’re the wife.

859
01:10:06,978 --> 01:10:08,304
We’re not married.

860
01:10:09,076 --> 01:10:11,245
To him, you’re his wife.

861
01:10:12,402 --> 01:10:13,757
You’re not alone.

862
01:10:13,971 --> 01:10:15,138
This is Josie.

863
01:10:15,475 --> 01:10:17,820
Ah, Pau’s wife.

864
01:10:18,891 --> 01:10:20,768
You’re both pretty.

865
01:10:20,991 --> 01:10:22,951
And lucky.
Both your husbands are yummy.

866
01:10:22,976 --> 01:10:26,023
- You bitch!
- Wait! Calm down!

867
01:10:36,044 --> 01:10:37,421
Are you good now?

868
01:10:38,745 --> 01:10:43,375
You got it out of your system.
Now are we good?

869
01:10:44,585 --> 01:10:47,796
JC is mine. Don’t you forget it.

870
01:10:48,797 --> 01:10:53,538
Enough, let’s just go.
Don’t get in a fight.

871
01:10:53,564 --> 01:10:56,303
Don’t worry, Josie.
We won’t make a scene.

872
01:10:57,447 --> 01:11:01,220
Right, Maritess?
Let’s not fight over JC.

873
01:11:01,855 --> 01:11:05,484
I see men as playthings,
just like me.

874
01:11:05,509 --> 01:11:07,867
- We’re not the same.
- Exactly.

875
01:11:08,002 --> 01:11:11,980
You have no reason to fear.
JC and I are done.

876
01:11:12,708 --> 01:11:16,295
I doubt that you and I will be friends.
But let’s not be enemies.

877
01:11:20,364 --> 01:11:25,269
You’re lucky I’m not a drama queen
like other women I know.

878
01:11:27,336 --> 01:11:31,048
I’ll say this for your peace of mind:
JC loves you.

879
01:11:31,593 --> 01:11:34,920
But I won’t be the last woman
who’ll find him attractive.

880
01:11:35,332 --> 01:11:38,669
Let’s hope that next time
he’ll be able to say no.

881
01:11:41,680 --> 01:11:43,030
I have to go.

882
01:11:43,055 --> 01:11:45,632
I have a regular customer waiting.
He’s very generous.

883
01:11:50,817 --> 01:11:52,486
She has a point.

884
01:11:52,801 --> 01:11:54,094
She’s smooth.

885
01:11:54,119 --> 01:11:55,412
Yes.

886
01:11:55,437 --> 01:11:56,730
You wanna be friends
with her, don’t you?

887
01:11:56,755 --> 01:11:58,359
No way.

888
01:11:58,384 --> 01:11:59,744
You're too tough!

889
01:12:02,279 --> 01:12:05,015
So this is what it's like.

890
01:12:05,040 --> 01:12:06,166
There they are.

891
01:12:06,166 --> 01:12:07,624
Hi.

892
01:12:07,794 --> 01:12:10,714
Have a seat.

893
01:12:10,963 --> 01:12:12,631
- Hello.
- Hi.

894
01:12:13,273 --> 01:12:16,929
Mommy, it's been a while.

895
01:12:17,187 --> 01:12:20,656
- This is JC's wife, Maritess.
- Hi.

896
01:12:29,231 --> 01:12:30,816
Wow.

897
01:12:39,186 --> 01:12:40,811
Okay. Thank you.

898
01:12:47,620 --> 01:12:49,750
Wow!

899
01:13:10,383 --> 01:13:14,570
You’re doing well.
This new spot is great.

900
01:13:14,626 --> 01:13:17,998
Thanks to regulars like you.

901
01:13:18,023 --> 01:13:19,304
Is there fried noodles
and blood stew?

902
01:13:19,329 --> 01:13:20,624
Of course!

903
01:13:20,657 --> 01:13:23,148
- Four orders, please.
- Okay.

904
01:13:23,173 --> 01:13:25,859
It’s her first time in a gay bar.

905
01:13:25,884 --> 01:13:28,345
She never had to reason to go to one.
Until now.

906
01:13:29,819 --> 01:13:31,132
Am I a good dancer?

907
01:13:31,196 --> 01:13:34,453
The best.
Seems like you’re the star here.

908
01:13:35,124 --> 01:13:36,382
Of course!

909
01:13:37,595 --> 01:13:40,264
Why does it look like
you all have an erection?

910
01:13:42,306 --> 01:13:46,417
They rub it before going onstage

911
01:13:46,442 --> 01:13:53,359
so they’re always hard
in front of the audience.

912
01:13:53,384 --> 01:13:55,476
That bulge is distracting.

913
01:13:56,646 --> 01:13:59,570
Is there a minimum size requirement?

914
01:14:00,589 --> 01:14:04,546
What’s important is the illusion.
Some use padding.

915
01:14:04,930 --> 01:14:06,739
To excite the audience.

916
01:14:07,804 --> 01:14:09,265
You know a lot about this.

917
01:14:09,290 --> 01:14:15,929
I had the same questions
on my first visit.

918
01:14:15,954 --> 01:14:20,734
But you know more than anyone
that my dick is not an illusion.

919
01:14:20,759 --> 01:14:22,677
It’s the hardest reality.

920
01:14:23,023 --> 01:14:28,266
I only know as much as Allan does.

921
01:14:29,989 --> 01:14:33,101
I don’t know about you,

922
01:14:33,164 --> 01:14:35,725
but I only come here
for the entertainment.

923
01:15:00,647 --> 01:15:02,336
Sleep well?

924
01:15:03,473 --> 01:15:04,838
Are you hungry?

925
01:15:06,504 --> 01:15:10,507
Let’s have a snack.

926
01:15:14,664 --> 01:15:17,083
You are my baby girl.

927
01:15:17,566 --> 01:15:19,543
I confronted Liza.

928
01:15:19,568 --> 01:15:23,822
You just had to, didn’t you?
Good thing there was no hair pulling.

929
01:15:24,112 --> 01:15:25,613
It was a good talk.

930
01:15:25,638 --> 01:15:27,937
I made it clear
that you’re mine alone.

931
01:15:28,097 --> 01:15:33,852
You know I am, completely.
Are you still doubting it?

932
01:15:34,666 --> 01:15:35,792
Prove it.

933
01:15:41,382 --> 01:15:44,050
Bro, Josie, Allan!

934
01:15:44,050 --> 01:15:46,636
Come on, let’s dance!

935
01:15:46,636 --> 01:15:48,346
Come on Allan, let’s dance.

936
01:15:48,371 --> 01:15:51,583
Josie, Allan. Join us!

937
01:15:51,608 --> 01:15:53,952
Okay, wait here, I’ll join them.

938
01:15:53,977 --> 01:15:56,179
Give it your best, hon!

939
01:16:02,027 --> 01:16:05,976
Let’s hear it for Pau!

940
01:16:06,001 --> 01:16:10,163
Show us what you can do!

941
01:16:34,313 --> 01:16:35,523
Josie?

942
01:16:37,179 --> 01:16:38,405
Are you okay?

943
01:16:40,146 --> 01:16:42,686
When are you going back
to America?

944
01:16:45,278 --> 01:16:46,738
Two days from now.

945
01:16:50,171 --> 01:16:52,882
When is Pau going?

946
01:16:55,174 --> 01:17:00,805
His interview with the embassy
is next month.

947
01:17:01,670 --> 01:17:08,128
Once his visa gets approved,
he can fly anytime.

948
01:17:12,591 --> 01:17:13,759
Josie...

949
01:17:15,362 --> 01:17:19,681
Is there something I can do
to ease your worries?

950
01:17:21,387 --> 01:17:24,395
Nothing. I’ll get used it.

951
01:17:29,978 --> 01:17:31,693
Thank you for saying yes.

952
01:17:34,035 --> 01:17:38,033
I don’t know
if I should be jealous or grateful.

953
01:17:48,425 --> 01:17:49,884
Thank you.

954
01:17:53,982 --> 01:17:56,401
I know you will take care of him.

955
01:17:59,854 --> 01:18:02,356
Let’s dance.

956
01:18:03,773 --> 01:18:05,066
Let's go.

957
01:18:09,738 --> 01:18:11,364
Let's go.

958
01:18:11,389 --> 01:18:13,141
Join in!

959
01:18:26,730 --> 01:18:30,192
I texted your brothers,
they’re on their way.

960
01:18:37,335 --> 01:18:40,606
I’ll get going. Take care.

961
01:18:40,791 --> 01:18:43,169
Pau, go with Allan.

962
01:18:43,222 --> 01:18:47,247
I can manage.
Pau needs to rest.

963
01:18:47,819 --> 01:18:49,450
Josie is right.

964
01:18:49,475 --> 01:18:51,018
I’ll bring you home.

965
01:18:51,043 --> 01:18:52,586
- Take care on your way home.
- You too.

966
01:18:52,611 --> 01:18:54,424
- Take care, bro.
- Bye!

967
01:18:54,449 --> 01:18:56,951
Take care, Allan.
Bro, take care of that one.

968
01:18:56,976 --> 01:18:59,479
- Bro, take care of Josie.
- Take care!

969
01:19:24,479 --> 01:19:28,191
We’re closed, there’s no more food—

970
01:19:28,216 --> 01:19:35,771
Hey! What are you doing
to my daughter? Stop that!

971
01:19:55,053 --> 01:19:57,889
Sorry, I ran out of gas.

972
01:20:00,140 --> 01:20:02,952
Bro, that’s stupid.
Gasoline is so basic!

973
01:20:02,977 --> 01:20:04,247
Here's the fare.

974
01:20:04,278 --> 01:20:05,607
Sorry, sir.

975
01:20:05,632 --> 01:20:07,810
- Drop it. We’re only three blocks away.
- Let’s go.

976
01:20:07,835 --> 01:20:09,712
Yeah, let’s walk.

977
01:20:15,848 --> 01:20:19,744
- Balut! Duck egg!
- Boss!

978
01:20:19,815 --> 01:20:21,130
Balut!

979
01:20:21,494 --> 01:20:23,896
- Want some, Boss?
- Let’s buy some for Ma and Queenie.

980
01:21:50,933 --> 01:21:54,021
- Hey!
- Let's go! Hurry!

981
01:21:54,169 --> 01:21:55,421
Hey!

982
01:21:56,785 --> 01:21:58,483
- Ma?
- Queenie?

983
01:21:58,508 --> 01:21:59,683
Ma.

984
01:21:59,708 --> 01:22:04,114
Ma? Ma!

985
01:22:04,139 --> 01:22:05,425
Queenie?

986
01:22:05,450 --> 01:22:06,677
Queenie!

987
01:22:06,742 --> 01:22:11,080
Queenie?

988
01:22:12,532 --> 01:22:17,388
Queenie!
What happened to you?

989
01:22:17,931 --> 01:22:19,558
Ma…

990
01:22:20,215 --> 01:22:22,260
Ma…

991
01:22:23,058 --> 01:22:24,601
Shit!

992
01:22:25,110 --> 01:22:26,271
JC?

993
01:22:26,296 --> 01:22:28,707
Where are you going, JC?

994
01:22:35,732 --> 01:22:41,655
Queenie, my child.

995
01:23:14,005 --> 01:23:15,101
JC!

996
01:23:15,126 --> 01:23:16,568
JC, stop!

997
01:23:16,593 --> 01:23:20,028
- Come out, you sons of bitches!
- Enough, JC…

998
01:23:20,053 --> 01:23:21,804
Damn you monsters!

999
01:23:21,829 --> 01:23:22,830
Stop!

1000
01:23:22,855 --> 01:23:25,833
- Damn you!
- Enough.

1001
01:23:26,387 --> 01:23:29,390
JC, get a hold of yourself.

1002
01:23:31,553 --> 01:23:35,693
- Come out and face me! Now!
- JC, please.

1003
01:23:45,406 --> 01:23:48,614
It will take a few weeks
for her wounds to heal.

1004
01:23:48,864 --> 01:23:53,023
The trauma, however,
is more serious.

1005
01:23:53,367 --> 01:23:57,278
Another doctor will guide you through it.

1006
01:23:59,659 --> 01:24:01,165
Thank you, Doc.

1007
01:24:02,989 --> 01:24:07,881
I’ll stay. Why don’t you go home
and get some rest?

1008
01:24:18,538 --> 01:24:20,435
Where are JC and Pau?

1009
01:24:21,167 --> 01:24:23,044
They’re outside, talking to the police.

1010
01:24:23,069 --> 01:24:25,941
We caught Andrei.

1011
01:24:26,090 --> 01:24:28,050
Natan is still on the loose.

1012
01:24:28,653 --> 01:24:31,092
Do you have a lead?

1013
01:24:31,389 --> 01:24:32,849
We’re working on it.

1014
01:24:33,526 --> 01:24:36,130
Sorry about your sister.
I hope she recovers soon.

1015
01:24:36,915 --> 01:24:38,333
Thank you, sir.

1016
01:24:43,868 --> 01:24:45,210
What are we going to do?

1017
01:24:46,303 --> 01:24:48,305
Both of them will pay for this.

1018
01:24:49,603 --> 01:24:51,479
They’ll catch Natan sooner or later.

1019
01:24:53,606 --> 01:24:56,476
I can’t get it out of my head,
how they hurt Ma.

1020
01:24:58,731 --> 01:25:02,143
And what they did to Queenie.

1021
01:25:05,008 --> 01:25:06,833
They might get away with this.

1022
01:25:08,179 --> 01:25:09,347
Relax.

1023
01:25:09,516 --> 01:25:11,378
Don’t do anything
to make things worse.

1024
01:25:18,325 --> 01:25:19,375
Pau...

1025
01:25:29,575 --> 01:25:30,706
Take this.

1026
01:25:32,474 --> 01:25:34,852
A little help.

1027
01:25:35,714 --> 01:25:36,757
Be strong.

1028
01:25:37,852 --> 01:25:39,312
I’m sorry about what happened.

1029
01:25:41,773 --> 01:25:46,194
Heart of darkness

1030
01:26:50,216 --> 01:26:51,843
- How’s it going?
- I’m okay.

1031
01:26:51,843 --> 01:26:54,262
About time you got here.
I’m so hungry.

1032
01:26:54,846 --> 01:26:57,348
- Are they still on the hunt for me?
- You bet.

1033
01:26:57,640 --> 01:26:59,100
So be careful.

1034
01:26:59,286 --> 01:27:02,090
I think you should move
to another hideout.

1035
01:27:05,039 --> 01:27:07,552
We re-open tomorrow.

1036
01:27:07,577 --> 01:27:10,688
I’ll stay here and take care
of Queenie.

1037
01:27:10,973 --> 01:27:12,225
Ma is right.

1038
01:27:12,250 --> 01:27:16,879
It might cheer Queenie up
if she’s at the eatery.

1039
01:27:16,909 --> 01:27:18,060
Love you, Ma.

1040
01:27:18,270 --> 01:27:20,700
Maritess, hand me your sister’s towel.

1041
01:27:20,746 --> 01:27:22,794
My son is extra sweet today.

1042
01:27:22,819 --> 01:27:24,375
I’m always sweet.

1043
01:27:24,450 --> 01:27:31,442
That’s because you were still breastfeeding
when you already had teeth.

1044
01:27:32,638 --> 01:27:38,927
He only stopped
after I rubbed my breasts with chili.

1045
01:27:38,952 --> 01:27:40,078
You’re exaggerating!

1046
01:27:40,160 --> 01:27:45,403
Congrats on the visa, bro.
When’s your flight?

1047
01:27:46,539 --> 01:27:49,685
Allan still has to book it.
He’s looking for the cheapest fare.

1048
01:27:51,122 --> 01:27:52,278
Thanks.

1049
01:27:52,671 --> 01:27:54,575
Exactly bro!

1050
01:27:54,600 --> 01:27:56,535
By some miracle,
I was released from jail.

1051
01:27:56,560 --> 01:27:58,259
Welcome back, bro.

1052
01:27:58,284 --> 01:28:00,846
JC...

1053
01:28:00,871 --> 01:28:02,623
I bet you missed me.

1054
01:28:02,720 --> 01:28:04,036
How are you?

1055
01:28:04,061 --> 01:28:05,479
How long were you in jail?

1056
01:28:05,558 --> 01:28:07,393
A few days.

1057
01:28:07,418 --> 01:28:10,380
And then I went to paradise to rest.

1058
01:28:10,782 --> 01:28:11,992
Wait a second.

1059
01:28:12,715 --> 01:28:13,966
Who bailed you out?

1060
01:28:14,258 --> 01:28:16,218
I have the right connections.

1061
01:28:16,243 --> 01:28:18,345
Let’s drink!

1062
01:28:18,387 --> 01:28:20,448
Drinks on me later.
It’ll be your sendoff.

1063
01:28:20,473 --> 01:28:22,683
My treat.
Anyway you’re leaving soon.

1064
01:28:22,708 --> 01:28:24,877
- You’re the man!
- Right? Drinks!

1065
01:28:31,692 --> 01:28:32,818
Where’s JC?

1066
01:28:32,843 --> 01:28:34,935
Backstage, maybe.

1067
01:28:57,580 --> 01:28:59,540
Ma, this is for you.

1068
01:28:59,965 --> 01:29:05,846
Pau wants you to have this so you can pay
for the rest of your shop space.

1069
01:29:06,894 --> 01:29:08,052
Keep it…

1070
01:29:08,077 --> 01:29:12,591
He might need this for his trip.

1071
01:29:12,616 --> 01:29:15,578
Allan will take care of the trip.

1072
01:29:16,731 --> 01:29:21,027
What about our property back home?

1073
01:29:22,088 --> 01:29:27,511
Pau will save up for the property
once he starts working in America.

1074
01:29:33,655 --> 01:29:35,115
A little extra.

1075
01:29:38,420 --> 01:29:40,214
Love you, Ma.

1076
01:29:44,682 --> 01:29:46,761
Thank you.

1077
01:29:51,641 --> 01:29:56,479
I want to be happy for Pau.

1078
01:29:59,673 --> 01:30:05,739
I want to think that
this is the start of a better life for him.

1079
01:30:11,205 --> 01:30:13,704
But I might never see him again.

1080
01:30:19,476 --> 01:30:22,730
JC was away for years.

1081
01:30:28,042 --> 01:30:32,087
And now it’s his brother
that’s leaving.

1082
01:30:50,675 --> 01:30:52,426
You asshole!

1083
01:30:52,451 --> 01:30:55,538
That was my sister,
you piece of shit!

1084
01:31:43,881 --> 01:31:45,104
Hello JC?

1085
01:32:00,860 --> 01:32:01,902
Josie!

1086
01:32:01,950 --> 01:32:03,028
Is JC here?

1087
01:32:03,484 --> 01:32:04,575
What’s going on?

1088
01:32:05,131 --> 01:32:06,167
Why, Pau?

1089
01:32:06,468 --> 01:32:08,216
What happened?

1090
01:32:08,241 --> 01:32:09,284
Ma.

1091
01:32:09,385 --> 01:32:11,428
He’s not at the bar.

1092
01:32:11,453 --> 01:32:12,955
I don’t know where JC is.

1093
01:32:13,573 --> 01:32:14,909
Where’s Maritess?

1094
01:32:15,474 --> 01:32:16,809
- Get Maritess.
- Ma.

1095
01:32:16,834 --> 01:32:18,349
Ma, it’s about JC…

1096
01:32:18,374 --> 01:32:19,411
Tell me.

1097
01:32:19,930 --> 01:32:22,291
- JC, he…
- I said tell me!

1098
01:32:32,817 --> 01:32:33,960
JC.

1099
01:32:35,311 --> 01:32:36,353
JC.

1100
01:32:44,499 --> 01:32:48,359
- I’m sorry. I couldn’t help it.
- I understand.

1101
01:32:49,989 --> 01:32:53,677
- We need to leave.
- No. You stay.

1102
01:32:59,548 --> 01:33:02,164
You need me.

1103
01:33:02,903 --> 01:33:05,293
I’m going with you.

1104
01:33:59,690 --> 01:34:02,922
Are you having second thoughts about
leaving because of what happened?

1105
01:34:03,727 --> 01:34:08,022
Shouldn’t it be the other way around?
We need to get out of here.

1106
01:34:11,661 --> 01:34:16,499
As long as we’re poor,
the problems will not end.

1107
01:34:17,266 --> 01:34:22,202
If we were better off, that wouldn’t
have happened to Ma and Queenie.

1108
01:34:24,696 --> 01:34:26,906
JC would be here, safe.

1109
01:34:28,150 --> 01:34:31,361
America’s our last chance.

1110
01:34:34,578 --> 01:34:36,788
If that’s what you believe...

1111
01:34:38,255 --> 01:34:39,924
I’m with you.

1112
01:34:41,258 --> 01:34:42,598
I know you will.

1113
01:34:43,253 --> 01:34:45,672
Don’t worry.

1114
01:34:46,734 --> 01:34:48,569
I’ll take care of them.

1115
01:34:49,789 --> 01:34:53,876
It breaks my heart to know
that JC needs me...

1116
01:34:54,609 --> 01:34:57,697
- I can’t do anything to help him.
- I know.

1117
01:34:59,790 --> 01:35:01,000
Money.

1118
01:35:02,243 --> 01:35:04,745
I will save lots of money for him.

1119
01:35:06,003 --> 01:35:08,922
We can’t do anything for him right now.

1120
01:35:10,311 --> 01:35:11,521
Thank you.

1121
01:35:16,387 --> 01:35:17,680
I love you.

1122
01:35:18,692 --> 01:35:21,637
In a few years,
our lives will be better.

1123
01:35:23,441 --> 01:35:24,950
What now?

1124
01:35:25,856 --> 01:35:27,483
I’m not turning myself in.

1125
01:35:27,779 --> 01:35:30,699
That’s why we should leave.

1126
01:35:33,092 --> 01:35:34,719
Listen to me. I’m begging you.

1127
01:35:36,830 --> 01:35:39,582
Please stay so you can help Ma.

1128
01:35:40,936 --> 01:35:42,521
Pau is leaving.

1129
01:35:43,245 --> 01:35:44,621
You’re strong.

1130
01:35:45,208 --> 01:35:46,867
They need you.

1131
01:35:46,892 --> 01:35:48,747
You need me.

1132
01:35:51,765 --> 01:35:53,481
I can manage by myself.

1133
01:35:53,506 --> 01:35:55,967
I’m scared for you.

1134
01:35:59,515 --> 01:36:01,016
Me too.

1135
01:36:06,814 --> 01:36:09,650
For the first time,
I will live on my own.

1136
01:36:11,218 --> 01:36:13,428
I need to do this.

1137
01:36:15,465 --> 01:36:17,425
So I can change.

1138
01:36:18,262 --> 01:36:19,946
So I can be a better man.

1139
01:36:22,284 --> 01:36:24,244
I hope you’ll understand.

1140
01:36:29,552 --> 01:36:31,296
Don’t cry.

1141
01:36:31,914 --> 01:36:33,403
Don’t cry.

1142
01:36:35,190 --> 01:36:37,692
I might not have the strength I need.

1143
01:36:40,806 --> 01:36:43,600
I can hold it in.

1144
01:36:45,436 --> 01:36:47,575
I love you very much.

1145
01:36:50,717 --> 01:36:54,420
- I love you very much too.
- Take care of yourself.

1146
01:36:54,445 --> 01:36:55,536
You too.

1147
01:36:57,197 --> 01:36:59,074
I’ll be in touch.

1148
01:36:59,860 --> 01:37:02,071
I’ll be the one to contact you.

1149
01:37:57,149 --> 01:37:59,333
It isn't easy to say goodbye
to your loved one,

1150
01:37:59,358 --> 01:38:02,107
especially if you might
never see them again.

1151
01:38:04,555 --> 01:38:06,927
My heart is in a lot of pain.

1152
01:38:07,953 --> 01:38:09,788
But JC is right.

1153
01:38:10,491 --> 01:38:12,451
I mustn’t cry.

1154
01:38:13,914 --> 01:38:18,272
There is no place for tears if I am
to survive this war called life.

1155
01:38:23,704 --> 01:38:25,497
I will be strong.

1156
01:38:26,919 --> 01:38:28,921
I will get up when I fall.

1157
01:38:29,123 --> 01:38:31,292
I will heal when I am injured.

1158
01:38:31,613 --> 01:38:36,919
When I feel weak, I will find strength
in the love of those around me.

1159
01:38:37,266 --> 01:38:38,834
I love JC.

1160
01:38:39,184 --> 01:38:41,687
His family is my family.

1161
01:38:42,091 --> 01:38:47,138
Like my father before me, I will
protect my territory to the very end.

1162
01:38:51,671 --> 01:38:52,755
Ma.

1163
01:38:53,690 --> 01:38:54,880
I love you.

1164
01:38:54,905 --> 01:38:56,239
I’ll miss you.

1165
01:39:17,008 --> 01:39:18,968
Take care of yourself, son!

1166
01:39:58,685 --> 01:40:00,521
Hello, Allan?

1167
01:40:00,951 --> 01:40:02,121
Hello Pau?

1168
01:40:03,271 --> 01:40:05,217
Are you on your way
to the airport?

1169
01:40:24,569 --> 01:40:25,689
Ma!

1170
01:40:28,249 --> 01:40:29,250
Pau?

1171
01:40:41,373 --> 01:40:43,608
What happened?

1172
01:40:45,338 --> 01:40:48,967
I’m sorry, Allan.
I’m not going.

1173
01:40:50,073 --> 01:40:52,325
My family needs me.

1174
01:40:56,228 --> 01:40:58,021
I owe you.

1175
01:40:59,170 --> 01:41:01,131
You’ve spent a lot of money on this.

1176
01:41:02,479 --> 01:41:06,006
And I might have given you more problems
because of my decision.

1177
01:41:08,278 --> 01:41:11,239
I’m already too much of a burden—

1178
01:41:12,214 --> 01:41:13,799
Drop me, I’ll understand.

1179
01:41:16,959 --> 01:41:18,103
Allan.

1180
01:41:19,311 --> 01:41:20,460
Are you crying?

1181
01:41:21,350 --> 01:41:22,570
Pau.

1182
01:41:25,387 --> 01:41:27,586
This is not the end, okay?

1183
01:41:28,470 --> 01:41:33,883
We will keep finding a way
to help your family.

1184
01:41:36,630 --> 01:41:37,798
Thank you.

1185
01:41:40,732 --> 01:41:42,192
I love you.

1186
01:41:45,409 --> 01:41:47,453
Take care of yourself.

1187
01:41:54,161 --> 01:41:56,847
Change of plans.

1188
01:41:56,872 --> 01:42:00,625
America’s not going anywhere.
It can wait.
