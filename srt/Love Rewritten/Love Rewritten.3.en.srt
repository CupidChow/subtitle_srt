1
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:46,830
Qiang'er

2
00:01:47,950 --> 00:01:50,160
Today, I marry you with the rites of a principal wife.

3
00:01:50,450 --> 00:01:51,950
This is truly an injustice to you.

4
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:53,000
Don't worry.

5
00:01:53,620 --> 00:01:55,910
From now on, I will favor you alone.

6
00:01:57,750 --> 00:01:59,000
Rest assured, Young Lord.

7
00:01:59,750 --> 00:02:01,500
I will absolutely not interfere with

8
00:02:01,580 --> 00:02:03,950
the relationship between you and the Young Lady.

9
00:02:06,370 --> 00:02:07,370
That's not right.

10
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,750
In the previous life, Xiao Jingyang said

11
00:02:10,250 --> 00:02:12,540
that he and Wang Yiqiang were mutually in love.

12
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
But in this life, this Miss Wang

13
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,700
doesn't seem to care about Xiao Jingyang.

14
00:02:17,790 --> 00:02:19,500
Could it be that in this life

15
00:02:19,620 --> 00:02:21,500
it's because we got married at the same time?

16
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:23,950
Young Lord

17
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:25,580
The City Lord is still waiting.

18
00:02:26,410 --> 00:02:27,870
Don't miss the auspicious hour.

19
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:31,040
Bestow the rites.

20
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:35,410
Rejoice, for the grand ceremony is complete today.

21
00:02:35,540 --> 00:02:36,950
A good match is thus made.

22
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:38,000
Recite the "Guan Ju" poem.

23
00:02:38,750 --> 00:02:40,200
Sing the elegant "Lin Zhi" song.

24
00:02:40,790 --> 00:02:41,580
Bow.

25
00:02:44,580 --> 00:02:46,750
May your descendants prosper for five generations.

26
00:02:46,790 --> 00:02:48,870
May good fortune spread like the harmony of the two Nans.

27
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:50,450
Be of one heart and mind.

28
00:02:50,660 --> 00:02:52,250
May your home be harmonious and prosperous.

29
00:02:52,700 --> 00:02:53,750
Bow again.

30
00:02:57,540 --> 00:02:59,000
Respect each other as honored guests.

31
00:02:59,370 --> 00:03:01,750
May you always share the joy of perfect harmony.

32
00:03:02,330 --> 00:03:03,660
Support each other with sincerity.

33
00:03:03,790 --> 00:03:06,160
Pledge the vow of mandarin ducks together.

34
00:03:06,790 --> 00:03:07,750
Bow a third time.

35
00:03:11,910 --> 00:03:14,200
With this certificate, the ceremony is complete.

36
00:03:15,370 --> 00:03:16,160
In the end,

37
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:18,580
we still married the daughter of General Wang together.

38
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:20,080
Xiao Jingyang,

39
00:03:20,370 --> 00:03:21,750
you must be quite pleased with yourself.

40
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:23,910
Young Lord,

41
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:26,120
will you be going to Lady Lin's room tonight,

42
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:27,580
or Lady Wang's room?

43
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,370
Of course, I want to go

44
00:03:33,540 --> 00:03:36,620
to Lady Wang's place.

45
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:40,750
It wasn't easy for me to marry her.

46
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:42,290
I want to see

47
00:03:44,540 --> 00:03:46,540
just how beautiful she is,

48
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:50,830
to have captivated the Young City Lord like this.

49
00:04:11,790 --> 00:04:13,830
Why do you look exactly like me?

50
00:04:15,330 --> 00:04:15,950
Young Lord,

51
00:04:15,950 --> 00:04:17,040
you may leave for now.

52
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:18,120
Leave this to me.

53
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:21,080
Let me take you to find Wang Yiqiang, okay?

54
00:04:23,330 --> 00:04:23,950
Young Madam,

55
00:04:23,950 --> 00:04:26,160
let's go find Wang Yiqiang, shall we?

56
00:04:26,700 --> 00:04:28,000
The Young Lord has had too much to drink.

57
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:28,370
Perhaps you should...

58
00:04:28,370 --> 00:04:28,870
Step back.

59
00:04:28,870 --> 00:04:29,870
I... I...

60
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:45,910
Who is it?

61
00:04:47,290 --> 00:04:48,160
You're awake now.

62
00:04:50,450 --> 00:04:51,450
Xiao Jingyang, are you crazy?

63
00:04:51,450 --> 00:04:52,410
Why did you splash me?

64
00:04:52,450 --> 00:04:53,620
If I didn't, you wouldn't wake up.

65
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:55,120
Are you waiting for them to find out

66
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:56,830
about us swapping bodies?

67
00:04:57,080 --> 00:04:57,870
Or

68
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,290
was last time not enough for you?

69
00:05:00,410 --> 00:05:01,950
Do you want to use the wedding night

70
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:04,200
to ruin my reputation?

71
00:05:06,750 --> 00:05:09,580
You worked so hard to win this woman,

72
00:05:09,660 --> 00:05:11,120
how could I let her spend her wedding night

73
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:12,290
alone in an empty room?

74
00:05:12,540 --> 00:05:13,750
I'm helping you.

75
00:05:20,620 --> 00:05:22,290
Don't go anywhere tonight.

76
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:24,290
You—

77
00:05:25,250 --> 00:05:27,040
You don't even have an explanation.

78
00:05:27,410 --> 00:05:28,290
Xiao Jingyang.

79
00:05:28,330 --> 00:05:30,330
As soon as I get my body back, I'll leave right away.

80
00:06:13,330 --> 00:06:14,160
Who

81
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:16,290
It's me

82
00:06:16,870 --> 00:06:18,790
Oh, it's Zhulan, the guard

83
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:21,950
I thought I'd run into an assassin on my wedding night

84
00:06:21,950 --> 00:06:23,870
Xiao Jingyang went to Lin Mingxuan's room

85
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:25,830
You still have the mood to eat here

86
00:06:26,410 --> 00:06:27,200
And read storybooks

87
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:29,500
He's a grown man, he can go wherever he wants

88
00:06:29,580 --> 00:06:30,450
Could I stop him?

89
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:32,330
You'd better not forget

90
00:06:32,330 --> 00:06:33,830
The reason you came here

91
00:06:33,910 --> 00:06:34,750
Don't worry

92
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:37,750
I'll do what I promised you

93
00:06:38,290 --> 00:06:39,080
But

94
00:06:39,580 --> 00:06:42,700
Don't think you can control me because of it

95
00:06:43,450 --> 00:06:44,450
Otherwise

96
00:06:47,540 --> 00:06:49,580
Sorry, my hand slipped

97
00:06:52,700 --> 00:06:54,250
My master won't spare you

98
00:06:55,870 --> 00:06:56,540
You

99
00:06:56,540 --> 00:06:57,290
Young Lord

100
00:06:57,950 --> 00:06:59,700
Young Lord, I've come to pay my respects

101
00:06:59,700 --> 00:07:00,500
Madam Wang

102
00:07:00,540 --> 00:07:01,870
I just wanted to pay my respects to the Young Lord

103
00:07:01,870 --> 00:07:03,040
What right do you have to stop me?

104
00:07:03,250 --> 00:07:05,160
Madam Wang, please lower your voice

105
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:07,450
Our lady and the Young Lord are still sleeping

106
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:13,870
Attending to the Young Lord's dressing.

107
00:07:13,870 --> 00:07:14,620
Yes.

108
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,040
Madam Wang came here early this morning.

109
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:20,870
Is there something you need?

110
00:07:20,950 --> 00:07:22,580
Why are you being so distant, sister?

111
00:07:22,580 --> 00:07:24,580
After all, we'll be family from now on.

112
00:07:24,580 --> 00:07:25,910
Who are you calling sister?

113
00:07:26,660 --> 00:07:27,750
Don't worry, sister.

114
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:29,450
The Young Lord is yours.

115
00:07:29,580 --> 00:07:30,830
I won't compete with you for him.

116
00:07:31,870 --> 00:07:32,700
Young Lord.

117
00:07:32,700 --> 00:07:33,500
Who's outside?

118
00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:34,410
It's Madam Wang.

119
00:07:34,410 --> 00:07:35,830
The Young Madam has already gone to handle it.

120
00:07:35,830 --> 00:07:37,290
Let this servant help you get dressed.

121
00:07:37,830 --> 00:07:39,370
Well done, Xiao Jingyang.

122
00:07:39,700 --> 00:07:41,950
Getting cozy right under my nose early in the morning.

123
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,200
Do you think I'm dead?

124
00:07:48,410 --> 00:07:50,080
Since Madam Wang is already here,

125
00:07:50,870 --> 00:07:52,120
why are you just standing at the door?

126
00:07:57,290 --> 00:07:58,120
Xiao Jingyang

127
00:08:02,660 --> 00:08:03,450
It's you.

128
00:08:05,250 --> 00:08:06,120
You are Wang Yiqiang.

129
00:08:06,660 --> 00:08:08,660
Xiao—no.

130
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,290
My newlywed wife.

131
00:08:10,620 --> 00:08:12,700
It's me, Young Lord.

132
00:08:12,700 --> 00:08:14,410
Me, did you forget?

133
00:08:14,830 --> 00:08:16,330
A few days ago, we were attacked while traveling.

134
00:08:16,370 --> 00:08:17,450
You saved us.

135
00:08:18,950 --> 00:08:20,080
You all...

136
00:08:20,450 --> 00:08:22,330
No wonder you looked so familiar.

137
00:08:22,330 --> 00:08:23,700
How are your injuries?

138
00:08:24,290 --> 00:08:25,660
Last time, we left in such a hurry.

139
00:08:25,870 --> 00:08:27,330
I didn't even get to ask your name.

140
00:08:27,450 --> 00:08:29,120
I didn't expect you to be General Wang's daughter.

141
00:08:29,330 --> 00:08:30,540
What a coincidence.

142
00:08:30,790 --> 00:08:31,580
Young Lord.

143
00:08:31,790 --> 00:08:32,660
The weather's getting cold.

144
00:08:32,660 --> 00:08:33,950
Put on more clothes before coming out.

145
00:08:36,750 --> 00:08:37,540
Bye-bye.

146
00:08:38,330 --> 00:08:39,410
I'll come find you in a bit.

147
00:08:39,580 --> 00:08:40,540
Last time, it was clearly...

148
00:08:40,540 --> 00:08:42,330
I approached them with bad intentions.

149
00:08:42,450 --> 00:08:44,250
Yet the Young Lord trusts me just like that.

150
00:08:45,370 --> 00:08:46,200
But...

151
00:08:47,370 --> 00:08:51,040
The sickly Young Lord and his domineering little wife

152
00:08:51,950 --> 00:08:53,790
really are a perfect match.

153
00:09:06,790 --> 00:09:07,580
Young Lord

154
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:09,000
The wine is finished, isn't it?

155
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:09,870
Let me pour you some.

156
00:09:09,870 --> 00:09:10,540
Wait.

157
00:09:14,830 --> 00:09:15,620
I...

158
00:09:17,750 --> 00:09:18,750
I'll pour it for you.

159
00:09:21,250 --> 00:09:24,660
Consider it my thanks for saving my life that day.

160
00:09:25,370 --> 00:09:26,580
If it weren't for you that day,

161
00:09:27,290 --> 00:09:28,700
I would have died long ago.

162
00:09:31,160 --> 00:09:32,750
Do you really believe

163
00:09:33,870 --> 00:09:35,700
that I came to save you all?

164
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:37,830
Xiao...

165
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:40,000
No, that's not right.

166
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:41,750
Mingxuan said the same thing.

167
00:09:42,950 --> 00:09:44,410
But you still acted.

168
00:09:45,290 --> 00:09:46,410
You saved me.

169
00:09:46,950 --> 00:09:48,500
You even got hurt for me.

170
00:09:49,450 --> 00:09:51,660
It's the first time someone got hurt to save me.

171
00:09:53,830 --> 00:09:55,450
It must have hurt a lot at the time.

172
00:09:58,870 --> 00:09:59,660
Don't worry.

173
00:10:00,410 --> 00:10:01,500
From now on, I'll protect you.

174
00:10:02,870 --> 00:10:03,790
Wang Yiqiang

175
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:06,660
How could you bear to harm such a Young Lord?

176
00:10:07,250 --> 00:10:08,040
Cheers.

177
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:13,870
Don't drink it.

178
00:10:15,950 --> 00:10:16,750
What's wrong?

179
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:19,080
The wine is a bit cold.

180
00:10:20,250 --> 00:10:21,410
I'll go warm up another pot.

181
00:10:25,410 --> 00:10:26,540
My head hurts so much.

182
00:10:28,660 --> 00:10:29,500
What's wrong with you?

183
00:10:30,540 --> 00:10:31,750
You didn't drink the wine.

184
00:10:33,870 --> 00:10:35,410
They poisoned the food.

185
00:10:48,870 --> 00:10:49,700
Take action!

186
00:10:49,830 --> 00:10:50,500
Yes!

187
00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:51,790
Forgive me, Young Lord.

188
00:10:51,790 --> 00:10:52,410
Hurry!

189
00:11:00,040 --> 00:11:01,370
Hurry and tie him up, take him back to his room.

190
00:11:01,450 --> 00:11:02,580
Young Madam, you mustn’t.

191
00:11:02,580 --> 00:11:04,450
Are we just going to let him go mad and hurt people?

192
00:11:05,580 --> 00:11:06,620
When the Young Master wakes up,

193
00:11:06,620 --> 00:11:07,750
I will explain everything myself.

194
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:08,790
Tie him up.

195
00:11:21,160 --> 00:11:22,500
I’ll go check on the Young Master.

196
00:11:25,830 --> 00:11:26,910
Keep a close eye on Wang Yiqiang.

197
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:30,000
Young Madam.

198
00:11:30,450 --> 00:11:31,250
You and I both know

199
00:11:31,250 --> 00:11:32,750
she’s the one who poisoned the Young Master.

200
00:11:33,080 --> 00:11:34,580
Why not just expose her directly?

201
00:11:37,620 --> 00:11:41,370
Let’s wait and catch a bigger fish.

202
00:12:10,580 --> 00:12:11,790
What are you doing?

203
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:12,790
Wiping off sweat.

204
00:12:12,910 --> 00:12:14,120
I know you're wiping off sweat.

205
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:16,910
But...

206
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:19,330
What does this mean?

207
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:20,830
You lost control last night.

208
00:12:20,830 --> 00:12:21,950
You tossed and turned all night.

209
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:23,290
You were drenched in sweat.

210
00:12:23,500 --> 00:12:24,870
If you don't dry off, you'll catch a cold.

211
00:12:25,870 --> 00:12:26,660
Untie me.

212
00:12:26,660 --> 00:12:27,500
I'll do it myself.

213
00:12:28,330 --> 00:12:29,160
What?

214
00:12:29,410 --> 00:12:31,160
You just want to touch my body that much?

215
00:12:31,660 --> 00:12:34,080
Who—who wants to touch your body?

216
00:12:34,700 --> 00:12:36,250
Young Lord, Young Lord!

217
00:12:37,410 --> 00:12:38,870
You're finally awake!

218
00:12:38,870 --> 00:12:41,250
I thought you wouldn't wake up.

219
00:12:41,870 --> 00:12:42,790
Stand back.

220
00:12:42,830 --> 00:12:44,450
Don't dirty the Young Lord.

221
00:12:44,450 --> 00:12:45,370
Young Lord.

222
00:12:45,700 --> 00:12:47,290
Did you fall into the stove or something?

223
00:12:49,700 --> 00:12:50,500
I'm fine.

224
00:12:50,540 --> 00:12:52,700
It's good that you're awake, really good.

225
00:12:52,750 --> 00:12:54,160
Although the Young Lord is awake,

226
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:55,540
it's only temporary.

227
00:12:56,620 --> 00:12:57,410
What?

228
00:12:58,370 --> 00:13:00,450
The poison in the Young Lord is quite potent.

229
00:13:00,790 --> 00:13:02,080
If there's no antidote,

230
00:13:02,410 --> 00:13:04,040
I'm afraid he won't survive more than three days.

231
00:13:04,080 --> 00:13:04,870
Poisoned?

232
00:13:06,620 --> 00:13:08,410
Young Lord, wait for me.

233
00:13:08,750 --> 00:13:10,160
I'll definitely find a way to save you.

234
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:11,870
Qiangqiang.

235
00:13:23,870 --> 00:13:24,830
I've been poisoned.

236
00:13:25,290 --> 00:13:26,080
No.

237
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:27,330
You're the one who's been poisoned.

238
00:13:28,080 --> 00:13:30,330
But I remember several times in my past life

239
00:13:30,330 --> 00:13:31,910
when you also lost control like you did last night.

240
00:13:32,370 --> 00:13:33,330
Didn't you tell me

241
00:13:33,330 --> 00:13:34,870
that you've had headaches since you were a child?

242
00:13:34,950 --> 00:13:35,870
Do you know

243
00:13:36,330 --> 00:13:38,830
that Wang Yiqiang poisoned your wine last night?

244
00:13:38,870 --> 00:13:40,000
Why would she poison me?

245
00:13:40,660 --> 00:13:41,450
No, that's not right.

246
00:13:41,620 --> 00:13:43,250
Why would she poison you, the young lord?

247
00:13:43,660 --> 00:13:44,750
And do you know

248
00:13:44,910 --> 00:13:46,950
why I must marry Wang Yiqiang?

249
00:13:48,580 --> 00:13:50,330
Isn't it because you like her?

250
00:13:51,290 --> 00:13:53,500
But you really are quite cold to her.

251
00:13:54,620 --> 00:13:55,750
So what's the real reason?

252
00:13:55,870 --> 00:13:56,950
Marrying Wang Yiqiang

253
00:13:57,500 --> 00:13:58,870
is a fate I can't escape.

254
00:13:59,950 --> 00:14:01,450
You'll understand in the future.

255
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:04,200
What about your headaches?

256
00:14:06,370 --> 00:14:07,580
Every time you had an episode before,

257
00:14:07,580 --> 00:14:08,620
you always avoided me.

258
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:11,040
It was only during last night's episode that I realized

259
00:14:11,830 --> 00:14:12,910
just how much pain you were in.

260
00:14:14,700 --> 00:14:16,250
I've gotten used to the headaches.

261
00:14:18,290 --> 00:14:20,080
Next time the headaches come,

262
00:14:20,330 --> 00:14:22,080
I'll find a way to switch our bodies back.

263
00:14:23,290 --> 00:14:24,080
Xiao Jingyang.

264
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:29,000
I'm not afraid of pain.
