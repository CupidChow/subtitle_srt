1
00:01:21,660 --> 00:01:22,700
Something's not right.

2
00:01:23,830 --> 00:01:24,540
Be careful.

3
00:01:35,120 --> 00:01:36,580
As expected of the young lord.

4
00:01:36,910 --> 00:01:37,750
What a pity.

5
00:01:38,660 --> 00:01:40,080
You realized it too late.

6
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:41,290
Zhu Lan.

7
00:01:41,870 --> 00:01:43,290
Today, I'll kill you.

8
00:01:43,290 --> 00:01:44,410
To avenge Qiangqiang.

9
00:01:44,870 --> 00:01:45,660
Don't worry.

10
00:01:46,410 --> 00:01:48,830
Today, I'll send you both to the afterlife together.

11
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:49,950
What are you going to do?

12
00:01:50,830 --> 00:01:52,290
What do you think I want to do?

13
00:01:52,950 --> 00:01:54,080
Don't you know?

14
00:01:54,870 --> 00:01:55,700
Rest assured.

15
00:01:56,450 --> 00:01:58,200
Any obstacles in your way

16
00:01:58,200 --> 00:01:59,580
I'll remove them for you.

17
00:01:59,870 --> 00:02:01,040
Your hands won't get dirty.

18
00:02:02,580 --> 00:02:03,830
You're going to harm Third Brother?

19
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:05,540
If you hadn't come today,

20
00:02:05,750 --> 00:02:07,120
I wouldn't have had this chance.

21
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,160
I just leaked a bit of

22
00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:10,870
news that you were injured at the Lin residence.

23
00:02:10,870 --> 00:02:12,450
He rushed over without a second thought.

24
00:02:13,540 --> 00:02:15,120
Just try to hurt him.

25
00:02:15,750 --> 00:02:16,540
Today,

26
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:18,450
between me and Xiao Jingyang,

27
00:02:18,450 --> 00:02:19,660
you must choose one.

28
00:02:19,660 --> 00:02:21,290
So you really are colluding with Lin Minghua.

29
00:02:21,790 --> 00:02:23,450
A wise bird chooses a good tree to nest in.

30
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:25,330
Since our young lord

31
00:02:25,330 --> 00:02:27,500
has no intention of fighting you for the city lord's position,

32
00:02:27,830 --> 00:02:29,450
someone else will take it for him.

33
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:32,870
If you know what's good for you, end it yourself.

34
00:02:33,450 --> 00:02:36,000
Then I can persuade our young lord and second miss

35
00:02:36,790 --> 00:02:38,450
to leave your bodies intact.

36
00:02:39,790 --> 00:02:41,910
Let's see if you have what it takes.

37
00:02:42,290 --> 00:02:43,080
Fine.

38
00:02:44,330 --> 00:02:46,870
Let me see for myself today

39
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:49,450
how much strength the usually frail young lord

40
00:02:49,870 --> 00:02:52,000
has been hiding all along.

41
00:02:52,700 --> 00:02:53,500
Stop!

42
00:02:59,080 --> 00:02:59,870
Zhulan

43
00:03:00,870 --> 00:03:03,200
Who allowed you to be so disrespectful to the young city lord?

44
00:03:03,250 --> 00:03:04,040
Young master

45
00:03:04,660 --> 00:03:06,700
Second Miss has carefully planned everything for you.

46
00:03:06,950 --> 00:03:08,750
As long as Xiao Jingyang dies today,

47
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:11,000
the position of city lord will be within your grasp.

48
00:03:13,450 --> 00:03:14,580
If you can't bear to do it,

49
00:03:16,580 --> 00:03:18,080
Zhulan will be your executioner.

50
00:03:18,620 --> 00:03:20,290
If you dare to touch him today,

51
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:23,000
you'll have to step over my dead body first.

52
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:23,950
Second young master

53
00:03:25,450 --> 00:03:26,790
No need for my elder brother to do it himself.

54
00:03:29,950 --> 00:03:30,790
Zhulan

55
00:03:31,910 --> 00:03:33,500
You and Lin Minghua lured the enemy in deep.

56
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:34,580
You led us here.

57
00:03:35,370 --> 00:03:38,370
Did you really think we wouldn't have a backup plan?

58
00:03:38,370 --> 00:03:39,290
What do you mean?

59
00:03:39,870 --> 00:03:40,790
The news of Zilin's death

60
00:03:40,790 --> 00:03:42,120
has already reached me,

61
00:03:42,450 --> 00:03:44,120
so it surely hasn't escaped Lin Minghua's notice either.

62
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:45,370
Zilin was a personal maid.

63
00:03:45,370 --> 00:03:46,540
Naturally, Lin Minghua

64
00:03:47,370 --> 00:03:49,160
is under heavy suspicion.

65
00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:49,910
So, would she

66
00:03:50,580 --> 00:03:52,950
really just wait here for us to catch her?

67
00:03:58,870 --> 00:03:59,950
Bring him to me alive.

68
00:04:01,290 --> 00:04:02,450
I want to see for myself

69
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:06,040
who your real master is behind all this.

70
00:04:06,660 --> 00:04:08,040
Who exactly is it?

71
00:04:11,870 --> 00:04:12,910
Why?

72
00:04:13,790 --> 00:04:15,450
Why didn't he choose me?

73
00:04:17,700 --> 00:04:19,750
Xiao Jingyu, who did you actually choose?

74
00:04:23,540 --> 00:04:24,330
Minghua.

75
00:04:25,620 --> 00:04:27,040
He's my younger brother.

76
00:04:27,250 --> 00:04:29,200
But he's also your biggest obstacle.

77
00:04:29,870 --> 00:04:30,660
Minghua.

78
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:35,660
If I weren't the second young master,

79
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:38,000
would you not be so stubborn about this?

80
00:04:40,950 --> 00:04:41,750
How about this,

81
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:44,040
let's leave together.

82
00:04:45,330 --> 00:04:46,790
Let's get out of here, okay?

83
00:04:47,790 --> 00:04:49,250
I will definitely protect you.

84
00:04:49,790 --> 00:04:51,080
No matter where you want to go,

85
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:53,580
even to the ends of the earth,

86
00:04:56,540 --> 00:04:58,910
I'll be with you, alright?

87
00:05:00,330 --> 00:05:01,660
So you chose him.

88
00:05:02,830 --> 00:05:05,290
You're going to give up the city lord's position that was within your grasp?

89
00:05:05,750 --> 00:05:07,160
What makes you think

90
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:08,540
that if you have nothing left,

91
00:05:08,540 --> 00:05:09,790
I would still love you?

92
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:15,950
So,

93
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,950
all those years of vows and promises

94
00:05:22,250 --> 00:05:23,700
were all fake, weren't they?

95
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:27,660
Did you ever truly love me?

96
00:05:30,450 --> 00:05:31,290
Was it all just because

97
00:05:31,290 --> 00:05:33,370
I was the second young master?

98
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:36,700
Yes, that's right.

99
00:05:37,910 --> 00:05:39,160
If you were the city lord,

100
00:05:39,790 --> 00:05:41,540
however you wanted Minghua to be,

101
00:05:41,540 --> 00:05:43,250
that's how Minghua would be.

102
00:05:44,290 --> 00:05:45,870
But if you were just an ordinary person,

103
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:49,290
why would I waste my feelings on you?

104
00:05:54,370 --> 00:05:55,160
Yes.

105
00:05:56,910 --> 00:05:58,660
I was just being foolishly sentimental.

106
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:07,870
Xiao Jingyu

107
00:06:09,660 --> 00:06:12,950
If you take even half a step out of this room today,

108
00:06:13,540 --> 00:06:17,330
there will be nothing between us from now on.

109
00:06:22,330 --> 00:06:23,160
Xiao Jingyu

110
00:07:09,870 --> 00:07:11,120
The dignified young lord of the city,

111
00:07:12,790 --> 00:07:14,200
still has to steal his brother's wine.

112
00:07:15,330 --> 00:07:16,200
I'm afraid you'll drink too much.

113
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:18,160
And end up drunk to death in my residence.

114
00:07:18,950 --> 00:07:20,540
I wouldn't know how to explain that to Father.

115
00:07:22,290 --> 00:07:23,750
Father has doted on you since you were young.

116
00:07:24,330 --> 00:07:25,950
How could he blame you for such a small matter?

117
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:27,660
He wouldn't hold it against you.

118
00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:31,500
I'm sorry.

119
00:07:38,250 --> 00:07:39,950
For all the misunderstandings I had about you before,

120
00:07:41,250 --> 00:07:42,120
I apologize.

121
00:07:49,790 --> 00:07:51,620
Actually, the one who should apologize is me.

122
00:07:54,370 --> 00:07:55,750
I relied on being older than you,

123
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,410
and always claimed it was for your own good,

124
00:07:59,410 --> 00:08:01,450
interfering in your marriage and your decisions.

125
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:03,910
Little did I know,

126
00:08:05,290 --> 00:08:06,830
it was my very presence

127
00:08:07,870 --> 00:08:10,000
that caused you the greatest harm.

128
00:08:11,750 --> 00:08:12,540
Second Brother,

129
00:08:34,870 --> 00:08:37,080
for the harm Minghua caused you and Lin Mingxuan,

130
00:08:38,330 --> 00:08:39,910
I apologize to you on her behalf.

131
00:08:40,910 --> 00:08:42,450
Let me atone for her mistakes.

132
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,080
But as your elder brother,

133
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:46,580
I want to be selfish one more time.

134
00:08:47,250 --> 00:08:48,040
I beg you,

135
00:08:51,790 --> 00:08:53,000
spare Minghua's life.

136
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:05,370
Lin Minghua bears several charges.

137
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:06,910
If she doesn't die,

138
00:09:08,410 --> 00:09:09,580
the people won't be satisfied.

139
00:09:17,660 --> 00:09:18,500
Then, if

140
00:09:20,450 --> 00:09:21,830
I take her place instead?

141
00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:29,040
What are you planning to do?
