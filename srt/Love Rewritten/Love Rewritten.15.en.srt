1
00:01:13,370 --> 00:01:14,160
Who is it?

2
00:01:14,750 --> 00:01:15,620
Second Miss.

3
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:17,870
It's me.

4
00:01:17,910 --> 00:01:18,750
Zhulan.

5
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:20,290
Why are you here?

6
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:24,000
Second Miss, you probably don't know.

7
00:01:24,410 --> 00:01:26,700
Zilin's attempt to assassinate Lin Mingxuan

8
00:01:26,830 --> 00:01:28,040
has already been exposed.

9
00:01:28,660 --> 00:01:31,500
Then has she fallen into Lin Mingxuan's hands?

10
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:32,250
No.

11
00:01:35,370 --> 00:01:36,540
She's already dead.

12
00:01:37,620 --> 00:01:38,410
You...

13
00:01:39,450 --> 00:01:40,290
If you didn't kill her,

14
00:01:40,290 --> 00:01:41,700
would you have kept her to testify against you?

15
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:48,540
She's just a maid.

16
00:01:50,750 --> 00:01:51,950
If she's dead, so be it.

17
00:01:55,620 --> 00:01:58,000
Second Miss, don't think that with Zilin dead

18
00:01:58,250 --> 00:01:59,750
there's no one left to testify.

19
00:02:01,700 --> 00:02:03,290
She was your person in the end.

20
00:02:03,750 --> 00:02:04,660
What do you mean?

21
00:02:04,950 --> 00:02:06,450
My master sent a message.

22
00:02:06,910 --> 00:02:07,700
Tomorrow is

23
00:02:07,700 --> 00:02:09,830
the day of your wedding with the Second Young Master.

24
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:12,660
It's also your best chance

25
00:02:12,660 --> 00:02:14,790
to help the Second Young Master clear away obstacles.

26
00:02:15,700 --> 00:02:17,290
You should seize this opportunity.

27
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:19,950
So you are the one...

28
00:02:19,950 --> 00:02:21,830
Something Second Miss shouldn't know.

29
00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:23,580
Second Miss, don't speculate.

30
00:02:24,750 --> 00:02:25,700
I've delivered the message.

31
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:26,910
Farewell.

32
00:02:42,750 --> 00:02:44,580
Second Young Master, something's wrong!

33
00:02:44,620 --> 00:02:46,250
What happened? Why are you in such a hurry?

34
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:52,580
Tell Zhu Lan to get out here right now.

35
00:02:52,790 --> 00:02:53,580
Lin Mingxuan.

36
00:02:53,750 --> 00:02:54,750
What do you mean by this?

37
00:02:54,750 --> 00:02:56,080
Zhu Lan killed Qiangqiang.

38
00:02:56,370 --> 00:02:57,660
I want him to pay with his life.

39
00:02:57,870 --> 00:02:58,700
What did you say?

40
00:02:58,830 --> 00:02:59,830
Don't pretend to be clueless.

41
00:03:00,660 --> 00:03:02,160
Last night, you pretended to save me.

42
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:03,870
But in reality, it was to lower my guard.

43
00:03:04,830 --> 00:03:06,410
Then you sent Zhu Lan to find me.

44
00:03:06,540 --> 00:03:07,200
All for the purpose of

45
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:08,790
killing me without anyone knowing.

46
00:03:08,790 --> 00:03:09,580
Isn't that right?

47
00:03:09,870 --> 00:03:10,870
Nonsense.

48
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:11,830
Second Brother.

49
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,540
Everything Mingxuan said is true.

50
00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:17,200
Second Brother, hand over Zhu Lan and we'll know the truth after questioning.

51
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:19,620
Zhu Lan disappeared last night.

52
00:03:20,870 --> 00:03:22,370
If you can't produce Zhu Lan today,

53
00:03:22,700 --> 00:03:24,120
then this marriage is off.

54
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:24,750
You...

55
00:03:26,410 --> 00:03:28,450
Fine, I agree.

56
00:03:29,250 --> 00:03:30,580
Search the entire city for Zhu Lan.

57
00:03:30,580 --> 00:03:32,410
Once he's caught, you can deal with him as you wish.

58
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:34,660
But Minghua is still waiting for me.

59
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,330
I can't let her become a laughingstock to the world.

60
00:03:38,410 --> 00:03:39,200
A laughingstock?

61
00:03:40,250 --> 00:03:42,620
Lin Minghua doesn't even care about killing someone.

62
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:44,910
Why would she care about being a laughingstock?

63
00:03:44,910 --> 00:03:45,580
Enough!

64
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,580
How dare you slander Minghua like this?

65
00:03:47,580 --> 00:03:49,160
Lin Minghua's personal maid

66
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:51,830
Zilin participated in the assassination with Zhu Lan last night.

67
00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:53,250
The evidence is conclusive.

68
00:03:53,290 --> 00:03:54,950
As for whether Lin Minghua was involved,

69
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:56,910
Second Brother, you can judge for yourself.

70
00:03:58,700 --> 00:04:00,500
The ones who died were from my Young Lord's residence.

71
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:01,620
I will investigate this myself.

72
00:04:01,620 --> 00:04:02,540
When the time comes,

73
00:04:03,450 --> 00:04:05,660
Brother, don't blame me for disregarding our bond.

74
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:07,000
Impossible.

75
00:04:07,540 --> 00:04:08,500
Minghua could never do

76
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:09,370
something so cruel.

77
00:04:09,370 --> 00:04:10,660
Brother, have you ever considered

78
00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:12,540
that during the epidemic in Liucheng,

79
00:04:13,410 --> 00:04:15,660
when my life was in danger and I desperately needed your help,

80
00:04:15,750 --> 00:04:17,830
why did Lin Minghua also happen to fall ill?

81
00:04:19,450 --> 00:04:21,000
And insisted on taking you away with her?

82
00:04:21,790 --> 00:04:22,910
Have you also thought about

83
00:04:23,330 --> 00:04:24,620
why Lin Minghua was able to command

84
00:04:24,620 --> 00:04:26,160
your personal guard, Zhulan,

85
00:04:26,660 --> 00:04:28,290
to set fire to the people in the quarantine zone?

86
00:04:30,750 --> 00:04:31,790
That's because

87
00:04:33,830 --> 00:04:35,450
they had already joined forces.

88
00:04:35,450 --> 00:04:36,450
Say no more.

89
00:04:38,580 --> 00:04:39,410
Fine.

90
00:04:40,660 --> 00:04:42,830
I'll go ask Minghua for the truth right now.

91
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:45,040
If this matter

92
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:46,540
really is connected to her,

93
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,830
I will definitely give you all an explanation.

94
00:04:55,950 --> 00:04:56,830
Let him go.

95
00:04:57,290 --> 00:04:59,160
But what if he chooses to believe Lin Minghua

96
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:00,370
and insists on protecting her?

97
00:05:00,370 --> 00:05:01,370
What should we do then?

98
00:05:05,910 --> 00:05:07,120
If it really comes to that,

99
00:05:08,790 --> 00:05:10,040
I will take matters into my own hands.

100
00:05:24,330 --> 00:05:27,120
Qiangqiang, don't worry.

101
00:05:28,450 --> 00:05:30,450
I will definitely avenge you.

102
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:38,540
Lin Minghua is nothing to be afraid of.

103
00:05:39,830 --> 00:05:42,120
The one truly controlling Zhulan from behind the scenes

104
00:05:43,750 --> 00:05:45,540
is the one we really need to guard against.

105
00:05:45,870 --> 00:05:48,250
Isn't Zhulan one of Lin Minghua's people?

106
00:05:48,910 --> 00:05:50,290
She's just the young lady of the Lin family.

107
00:05:50,580 --> 00:05:51,450
Even if she carries

108
00:05:51,450 --> 00:05:53,330
the title of the future wife of the Second Young Master,

109
00:05:54,250 --> 00:05:57,500
Zhulan would never betray his elder brother.

110
00:05:59,330 --> 00:06:00,080
Young Lord,

111
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:01,000
we've received news.

112
00:06:01,370 --> 00:06:02,410
Someone found

113
00:06:02,410 --> 00:06:04,450
the bodies of a doctor and a woman at the inn.

114
00:06:04,830 --> 00:06:06,200
The woman's identity has been confirmed.

115
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:07,040
It's Zilin.

116
00:06:07,830 --> 00:06:09,330
Second Young Master, you can't go in.

117
00:06:10,870 --> 00:06:12,080
My Second Young Master,

118
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:13,580
you've finally arrived.

119
00:06:14,370 --> 00:06:15,410
But Second Young Master,

120
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:18,200
it doesn't seem proper for you to barge into the boudoir.

121
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:19,000
Perhaps you could wait—

122
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:19,790
Master Lin,

123
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:22,750
I have important matters to discuss with Minghua.

124
00:06:23,540 --> 00:06:24,950
Could you please step out for a moment?

125
00:06:37,330 --> 00:06:38,120
Jingyu

126
00:06:40,950 --> 00:06:43,160
Where did you go last night?

127
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:44,450
Today is our wedding day.

128
00:06:45,370 --> 00:06:47,540
I stayed in my room last night.

129
00:06:47,660 --> 00:06:49,040
Preparing for the wedding.

130
00:06:49,410 --> 00:06:50,750
Did something happen?

131
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:53,870
Minghua

132
00:06:54,950 --> 00:06:56,120
I want to hear the truth.

133
00:06:56,500 --> 00:06:58,120
I am telling the truth.

134
00:06:58,120 --> 00:06:59,580
Jingyu, what's wrong with you today?

135
00:06:59,830 --> 00:07:01,580
Why don't you believe anything I say?

136
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:08,080
Why aren't you wearing the earrings I gave you today?

137
00:07:10,700 --> 00:07:12,660
The earrings you gave me are beautiful,

138
00:07:12,910 --> 00:07:15,540
but they don't match today's wedding dress.

139
00:07:16,580 --> 00:07:17,410
They don't match?

140
00:07:19,250 --> 00:07:20,580
Or are they not a pair?

141
00:07:24,410 --> 00:07:26,250
It's all Zilin's fault.

142
00:07:26,370 --> 00:07:28,450
She stole my earrings yesterday.

143
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:30,790
The earrings are in there.

144
00:07:31,450 --> 00:07:33,290
I was afraid you'd blame me for being careless,

145
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,410
so I hid it from you.

146
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:44,830
Minghua

147
00:07:47,830 --> 00:07:50,000
Do you know how much I love you?

148
00:07:51,160 --> 00:07:52,330
It's because I love you

149
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:55,200
that every expression of yours is engraved in my heart.

150
00:07:56,500 --> 00:07:57,660
It's because I love you

151
00:07:58,250 --> 00:07:59,790
that I recognize every look in your eyes

152
00:08:00,790 --> 00:08:02,540
right away.

153
00:08:08,580 --> 00:08:09,410
I'm asking you.

154
00:08:11,700 --> 00:08:14,540
Were you the one who tried to assassinate Lin Mingxuan last night?

155
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:16,950
Isn't that right?

156
00:08:18,870 --> 00:08:20,290
The one who plotted in Liucheng

157
00:08:20,870 --> 00:08:22,580
and tried to infect Third Brother with the plague,

158
00:08:22,580 --> 00:08:24,450
that was you too, wasn't it?

159
00:08:26,620 --> 00:08:27,950
You pretended to send me away,

160
00:08:28,750 --> 00:08:30,950
and ordered Zhulan to burn Third Brother,

161
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:33,750
that was your plan too, wasn't it?

162
00:08:33,870 --> 00:08:35,000
So what if it was me?

163
00:08:36,290 --> 00:08:38,120
He was the old city lord's

164
00:08:38,660 --> 00:08:40,160
ideal successor.

165
00:08:40,660 --> 00:08:42,080
He was the one you devotedly

166
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:43,750
supported and admired as a good brother.

167
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:45,870
Jing Yu,

168
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:48,250
all of this was supposed to be yours.

169
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:51,500
I've never wanted the position of city lord.

170
00:08:51,700 --> 00:08:53,950
Right, you don't want it.

171
00:08:54,290 --> 00:08:55,290
But what about me?

172
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:57,200
Do you want me to spend my whole life

173
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:59,290
living under that wretch Lin Mingxuan?

174
00:08:59,580 --> 00:09:01,330
Just hand over the city lord's position that we've already secured

175
00:09:01,330 --> 00:09:02,580
without a fight?

176
00:09:06,040 --> 00:09:07,250
No, Minghua.

177
00:09:07,950 --> 00:09:09,250
Is power really that important to you?

178
00:09:09,830 --> 00:09:11,200
Is it truly that important?

179
00:09:11,250 --> 00:09:12,040
It is.

180
00:09:12,790 --> 00:09:15,250
The position of young city lord must be yours.

181
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:21,120
All these years,

182
00:09:22,290 --> 00:09:25,370
I've realized that I never really

183
00:09:25,540 --> 00:09:26,950
knew you at all.

184
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:29,790
No.

185
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,540
If you become the young city lord,

186
00:09:32,410 --> 00:09:33,700
