1
00:01:12,250 --> 00:01:14,450
Eating hotpot on a snowy day is pure happiness.

2
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:21,830
Xiao Jingyang.

3
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:37,290
I like you.

4
00:01:43,370 --> 00:01:44,790
How can you be so forward?

5
00:01:46,750 --> 00:01:47,790
This so-called reserve—

6
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:51,500
Can it feed me, or make you like me?

7
00:01:58,200 --> 00:01:59,040
Let's get to the point.

8
00:02:00,700 --> 00:02:02,160
The person who tried to assassinate you yesterday—

9
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:03,620
Did you get a good look at them?

10
00:02:07,330 --> 00:02:09,120
That woman kept her face covered with a veil.

11
00:02:09,700 --> 00:02:12,080
But I threw my special poison powder at her.

12
00:02:13,410 --> 00:02:16,830
This powder becomes poisonous when it meets blood on a wound.

13
00:02:19,330 --> 00:02:20,370
If we count the time—

14
00:02:21,290 --> 00:02:22,830
It should be taking effect about now.

15
00:02:25,330 --> 00:02:27,410
Since they're risking their lives for Xiao Jingyu,

16
00:02:28,700 --> 00:02:30,410
we might as well start with them.

17
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,500
Miss Lin is truly thoughtful.

18
00:03:06,700 --> 00:03:08,660
She even specially sewed a wedding robe for the Second Young Master.

19
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:10,580
The matters I asked you to prepare

20
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:12,080
are all ready, I presume?

21
00:03:13,330 --> 00:03:14,410
Please rest assured, Second Young Master.

22
00:03:14,660 --> 00:03:15,870
Everything has been properly arranged.

23
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,660
When Miss Lin sees the fireworks that day,

24
00:03:18,660 --> 00:03:19,870
she will surely be pleasantly surprised.

25
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:22,950
Second Young Master,

26
00:03:23,660 --> 00:03:25,250
this is the latest information on the Young Master's whereabouts.

27
00:03:34,580 --> 00:03:36,290
Lin Mingxuan will really go tonight?

28
00:03:36,290 --> 00:03:37,330
Absolutely certain.

29
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:39,500
She escaped last time.

30
00:03:39,790 --> 00:03:41,370
This time is a good opportunity.

31
00:03:43,370 --> 00:03:44,910
Don't let me down again.

32
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:46,830
I will not fail.

33
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:06,330
The lantern festival is as lively as ever this year.

34
00:04:06,790 --> 00:04:07,580
Why is it

35
00:04:07,910 --> 00:04:09,330
that you, Third Brother, are not with your beloved

36
00:04:09,660 --> 00:04:10,950
and instead came to see me?

37
00:04:13,750 --> 00:04:15,370
About the misunderstanding with you before,

38
00:04:15,580 --> 00:04:16,540
please don't blame me, Second Brother.

39
00:04:18,950 --> 00:04:20,080
We are brothers.

40
00:04:20,080 --> 00:04:21,910
There's no need to talk about misunderstandings between brothers.

41
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,160
You came today,

42
00:04:27,250 --> 00:04:28,700
not just to apologize, right?

43
00:04:29,450 --> 00:04:30,660
I do have a favor to ask.

44
00:04:31,620 --> 00:04:33,700
You oversee all the information in the city.

45
00:04:33,700 --> 00:04:35,120
I want you to help me investigate someone.

46
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:41,160
It's the mastermind behind the attack on Lin Mingxuan that day.

47
00:04:42,790 --> 00:04:44,870
This person tried to sow discord between us

48
00:04:45,250 --> 00:04:47,290
and even killed Sun San right under your nose.

49
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:50,080
I don't think you'll let him get away, will you?

50
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:56,790
So, you have a lead?

51
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:07,910
That day, Mingxuan

52
00:05:07,910 --> 00:05:09,910
sprinkled poison powder on that person's wound.

53
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:11,080
Second Brother, you can investigate

54
00:05:11,450 --> 00:05:12,290
who recently

55
00:05:12,290 --> 00:05:13,830
went to get these medicinal herbs.

56
00:05:18,750 --> 00:05:19,580
Find out clearly.

57
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:21,660
You must find this person for me.

58
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:22,870
Yes.

59
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:27,950
Sorry to trouble you, Second Brother.

60
00:05:29,790 --> 00:05:30,580
Third Brother.

61
00:05:30,700 --> 00:05:31,750
Leaving so early?

62
00:05:31,910 --> 00:05:32,830
Not staying a bit longer?

63
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:34,410
My wife is waiting for me outside.

64
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:35,870
I'll head out first.

65
00:05:53,580 --> 00:05:55,120
If you're really worried,

66
00:05:55,540 --> 00:05:56,870
why not go with him?

67
00:05:58,080 --> 00:05:59,080
You don't know

68
00:05:59,250 --> 00:06:01,660
every time I run into Xiao Jingyu, nothing good happens.

69
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,870
Besides, he's about to marry Lin Minghua.

70
00:06:05,750 --> 00:06:07,580
If I say something unpleasant,

71
00:06:07,910 --> 00:06:09,250
it'll put Shaojun in a difficult position.

72
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:11,660
You care about him so much.

73
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:15,660
When you have someone you like in the future,

74
00:06:15,660 --> 00:06:16,750
you'll understand.

75
00:06:17,950 --> 00:06:19,410
What's so good about getting married?

76
00:06:19,950 --> 00:06:21,330
Once I get the divorce papers,

77
00:06:21,700 --> 00:06:25,080
I'll either go to the battlefield with my father to fight the enemy,

78
00:06:25,370 --> 00:06:27,620
or I'll roam the world with my sword.

79
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:30,080
I don't want to be trapped in this house,

80
00:06:30,250 --> 00:06:31,830
being a wife and raising children.

81
00:06:32,250 --> 00:06:33,120
Alright, alright.

82
00:06:33,660 --> 00:06:34,750
When I get back today,

83
00:06:34,750 --> 00:06:35,700
I'll tell Xiao Jingyang

84
00:06:35,700 --> 00:06:37,000
to give you a divorce paper

85
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:38,120
and set you free.

86
00:06:38,290 --> 00:06:39,910
That's what a good sister does.

87
00:06:46,750 --> 00:06:47,870
So, what do you think about this one?

88
00:06:47,870 --> 00:06:49,040
Isn't it just getting married?

89
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:49,330
Let's go with this one, then.

90
00:06:49,330 --> 00:06:50,330
This one is pretty good.

91
00:06:50,660 --> 00:06:52,200
In a few days, Minghua will marry into the family.

92
00:06:52,870 --> 00:06:54,000
I'll have a wife too.

93
00:07:09,620 --> 00:07:10,410
Mingxuan.

94
00:07:15,250 --> 00:07:16,080
Um...

95
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:20,160
It seems Mingxiang Restaurant has two fine wines tonight.

96
00:07:20,790 --> 00:07:23,200
It would be a shame if I didn't go grab a couple of bottles.

97
00:07:23,660 --> 00:07:24,540
I'll head out first.

98
00:07:33,080 --> 00:07:33,950
Since we're already here,

99
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:35,910
let's take a look around.

100
00:07:36,660 --> 00:07:37,450
Sure!

101
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:40,370
I've never been to the Lantern Festival before, either.

102
00:07:59,370 --> 00:08:00,160
Boss.

103
00:08:00,540 --> 00:08:03,080
How much for two skewers?

104
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:04,000
Four wen.

105
00:08:05,290 --> 00:08:06,200
We'll take two, please.

106
00:08:07,830 --> 00:08:09,160
Why is he coming so close?

107
00:08:16,790 --> 00:08:17,500
Third Brother.

108
00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:18,450
Candied hawthorn.

109
00:08:18,950 --> 00:08:20,790
Do you remember when you used to pester me as a kid

110
00:08:20,790 --> 00:08:22,410
to buy you candied hawthorn?

111
00:08:29,080 --> 00:08:29,910
Second Young Master

112
00:08:30,410 --> 00:08:31,950
On such a wonderful night like this,

113
00:08:32,160 --> 00:08:34,040
aren't you going to keep my dear sister company?

114
00:08:34,040 --> 00:08:35,330
Aren't you afraid she'll be upset?

115
00:08:36,040 --> 00:08:38,580
Minghua isn't as jealous as you.

116
00:08:38,580 --> 00:08:39,790
You're calling me jealous?

117
00:08:39,830 --> 00:08:41,580
You're the one who insisted on coming along.

118
00:08:42,160 --> 00:08:43,540
There are so many people here tonight.

119
00:08:43,620 --> 00:08:44,950
I'm here to protect Third Brother.

120
00:08:44,950 --> 00:08:46,080
What does that have to do with you?

121
00:08:46,540 --> 00:08:47,790
If you really can't stand it,

122
00:08:48,370 --> 00:08:49,750
you're free to go back home.

123
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:50,500
You—

124
00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:51,200
Enough.

125
00:08:52,950 --> 00:08:54,500
If Second Brother wants to stay, let him.

126
00:08:55,450 --> 00:08:56,790
That's what good brothers do.

127
00:08:58,250 --> 00:08:59,080
Thank you, Second Brother.

128
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:08,540
Why are you stopping me?

129
00:09:11,580 --> 00:09:13,040
Second Brother is acting a bit strange today.

130
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:17,250
Could it be that the person who wants to kill me will act tonight?

131
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:18,910
I don't know.

132
00:09:19,790 --> 00:09:21,500
But Second Brother definitely knows something.

133
00:09:23,450 --> 00:09:24,250
Come with me.

134
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:35,830
Third Brother

135
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:37,830
Do you think Minghua would like this hairpin—

136
00:09:43,450 --> 00:09:44,250
Zhulan

137
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:50,950
Wang Yiqiang

138
00:09:51,580 --> 00:09:54,160
The Young Lord just went to the lantern festival with Mingxuan.

139
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:55,540
So don't disturb them.

140
00:09:55,870 --> 00:09:57,290
What do you know? Move aside.

141
00:09:59,250 --> 00:10:00,080
No, I won't.

142
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:04,080
Tonight, I'll protect Xuanyang's love.

143
00:10:04,620 --> 00:10:05,830
No one should even think about disturbing them.

144
00:10:06,620 --> 00:10:07,750
Fine, Wang Yiqiang.

145
00:10:08,410 --> 00:10:10,080
I really underestimated you.

146
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:11,250
I told you to break them up.

147
00:10:11,250 --> 00:10:13,000
Get rid of that poisonous woman Lin Mingxuan for me.

148
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:13,950
But look at you.

149
00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:15,330
You actually brought them together.

150
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:17,120
If I had known this would happen,

151
00:10:17,290 --> 00:10:18,700
I wouldn't have let you marry over there.

152
00:10:18,700 --> 00:10:20,080
Just to make my third brother upset for no reason.

153
00:10:20,290 --> 00:10:21,160
Break them up?

154
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:25,410
Weren't you the one who told me to poison the Young Lord?

155
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:28,160
What nonsense are you talking about?

156
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:31,000
Weren't you the one who gave Zhulan the poison

157
00:10:31,330 --> 00:10:32,370
and told him to give it to me?

158
00:10:32,830 --> 00:10:34,620
You even threatened me with my father's life.

159
00:10:34,620 --> 00:10:35,950
You forced me to poison the Young Lord, didn't you?

160
00:10:37,540 --> 00:10:38,330
Poisoning...
