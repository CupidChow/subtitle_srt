1
00:01:11,160 --> 00:01:12,790
How come I've never seen it before?

2
00:01:13,120 --> 00:01:15,080
It's in the secret room of Young Lord's study.

3
00:01:15,250 --> 00:01:16,830
I saw it by accident before.

4
00:01:17,660 --> 00:01:18,540
Secret room.

5
00:01:29,080 --> 00:01:31,290
There's no clue about the secret room's switch anywhere.

6
00:01:33,410 --> 00:01:34,250
That's strange.

7
00:01:34,660 --> 00:01:35,750
Where is it hidden?

8
00:01:42,700 --> 00:01:44,870
You can tell at a glance that it's been rubbed often.

9
00:01:46,790 --> 00:01:47,750
Could it be...

10
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:50,290
These

11
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:53,370
are all me

12
00:03:07,870 --> 00:03:08,660
Strange

13
00:03:10,250 --> 00:03:13,290
These paintings all seem to be of me

14
00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:16,620
but they don't quite look like me

15
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:21,370
No matter how I look at them

16
00:03:23,580 --> 00:03:24,790
this person is always you

17
00:03:25,870 --> 00:03:27,790
but something still feels off

18
00:03:27,830 --> 00:03:28,660
How about

19
00:03:29,660 --> 00:03:31,120
we just go ask Shaojun directly

20
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:32,040
That won't do

21
00:03:32,540 --> 00:03:35,000
If he finds out I sneaked into the secret room

22
00:03:35,410 --> 00:03:37,000
he might get angry and

23
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:39,870
Then what should we do

24
00:03:40,830 --> 00:03:41,910
So what do you want to do

25
00:03:44,660 --> 00:03:45,370
Oh right

26
00:03:45,370 --> 00:03:46,290
Do you remember last time

27
00:03:46,290 --> 00:03:48,080
when I asked you for a favor at the Liucheng Inn

28
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:49,120
Of course I remember

29
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:49,830
Don't worry

30
00:03:49,830 --> 00:03:51,500
I've already taken care of everything

31
00:03:52,830 --> 00:03:53,950
I still don't believe

32
00:03:54,410 --> 00:03:56,660
that we can't deal with Xiao Jingyang this way

33
00:04:00,540 --> 00:04:01,330
Shaojun

34
00:04:02,750 --> 00:04:03,540
Something's wrong

35
00:04:03,620 --> 00:04:05,410
The young madam was taken away by the second young master’s men

36
00:04:05,410 --> 00:04:06,250
What did you say

37
00:04:06,250 --> 00:04:08,290
I saw them heading toward the city tower

38
00:04:32,950 --> 00:04:33,750
Mingxuan

39
00:04:50,290 --> 00:04:51,120
Xiao Jingyang

40
00:04:53,870 --> 00:04:55,620
You once promised me

41
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,910
that we would stay together in this life, never leaving or abandoning each other

42
00:05:02,870 --> 00:05:04,620
but in the end, you didn't keep your word

43
00:05:06,540 --> 00:05:07,950
I also once told you

44
00:05:09,700 --> 00:05:13,080
that in the next life, I would never love you again

45
00:05:14,910 --> 00:05:16,580
But no matter how determined I am

46
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:19,410
when I see you again

47
00:05:20,870 --> 00:05:24,580
all my resolve disappears

48
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:31,910
In this lifetime,

49
00:05:33,250 --> 00:05:35,080
you haven't given me any promises.

50
00:05:36,700 --> 00:05:37,910
But I want to ask you,

51
00:05:39,250 --> 00:05:40,750
are you willing to hold my hand

52
00:05:41,660 --> 00:05:42,950
and stay with me until we grow old?

53
00:05:44,660 --> 00:05:46,790
I, Xiao Jingyang, swear to the heavens today

54
00:05:47,700 --> 00:05:49,830
that in this life, I will only love Lin Mingxuan.

55
00:05:50,700 --> 00:05:54,290
We will rely on each other in this life, never leaving or abandoning one another.

56
00:05:57,790 --> 00:05:58,620
Mingxuan.

57
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:03,870
Mingxuan.

58
00:06:08,700 --> 00:06:11,160
Mingxuan, Mingxuan!

59
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:27,700
Xiao Jingyang, what's wrong?

60
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:29,580
Is the poison acting up again?

61
00:06:29,700 --> 00:06:31,080
How did you know it was poisoning?

62
00:06:31,330 --> 00:06:32,790
My master told me.

63
00:06:36,290 --> 00:06:37,700
Since you know it's poisoning,

64
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,330
then you should also know

65
00:06:40,830 --> 00:06:42,040
that I don't have many years left.

66
00:06:43,450 --> 00:06:44,250
What,

67
00:06:45,250 --> 00:06:46,660
do you want to be a widow while I'm still alive?

68
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:47,660
Jingyang.

69
00:06:47,660 --> 00:06:48,500
What a pity.

70
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:53,830
I didn't like you in the previous life.

71
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:55,950
And in this life,

72
00:06:57,290 --> 00:06:58,700
I will never fall in love with you even more.

73
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:01,950
Did you think that before,

74
00:07:01,950 --> 00:07:03,450
my tolerance for you was because I liked you?

75
00:07:06,950 --> 00:07:08,950
It was only because you took over my body.

76
00:07:10,750 --> 00:07:12,080
I had no other choice.

77
00:07:22,620 --> 00:07:24,040
Since you don't like me,

78
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:27,200
then what is this?

79
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:33,950
You don't like me.

80
00:07:33,950 --> 00:07:35,330
Then why did you paint my portrait?

81
00:07:35,830 --> 00:07:37,790
Why did you hide it in a secret room?

82
00:07:39,250 --> 00:07:41,330
How do you know the woman in the painting is you?

83
00:07:45,660 --> 00:07:46,700
What did you say?

84
00:07:48,910 --> 00:07:50,200
Since you've been to the secret room,

85
00:07:51,290 --> 00:07:52,500
and seen those paintings,

86
00:07:53,910 --> 00:07:54,910
you should know

87
00:07:54,910 --> 00:07:57,580
that except for the face,

88
00:07:57,580 --> 00:07:59,540
what else about her is similar to you?

89
00:08:00,950 --> 00:08:02,080
Take a good look.

90
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:04,620
The actions they're doing—

91
00:08:04,790 --> 00:08:06,500
have you ever done any of them?

92
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:10,910
So,

93
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:14,040
I'm just her substitute.

94
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:21,000
Yes.

95
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:29,750
Who is this woman?

96
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:33,620
You're not worthy to know.

97
00:08:36,620 --> 00:08:37,410
Fine.

98
00:08:39,790 --> 00:08:42,160
Xiao Jingyang, you're really something.

99
00:08:43,250 --> 00:08:45,910
No matter if it's this life or the last,

100
00:08:47,330 --> 00:08:48,620
you always manage to hurt me.

101
00:08:51,370 --> 00:08:52,160
That's true.

102
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:54,790
Who am I, Lin Mingxuan, anyway?

103
00:08:55,660 --> 00:08:57,910
How could I ever deserve the young lord's affection?

104
00:09:50,620 --> 00:09:51,410
Mingxuan

105
00:09:51,700 --> 00:09:54,040
You've locked yourself in for a whole day and night.

106
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:55,750
Why don't you eat something first?

107
00:09:57,250 --> 00:09:58,040
Mingxuan

108
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
Should I go and get Shaojun?

109
00:10:01,830 --> 00:10:03,040
Invite that ungrateful person?

110
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:04,410
Why bother with that heartless man?

111
00:10:07,660 --> 00:10:08,450
Shaojun

112
00:10:09,660 --> 00:10:10,790
Take it down and heat it up.

113
00:10:10,790 --> 00:10:11,620
Yes.

114
00:10:12,910 --> 00:10:13,750
Mingxuan

115
00:10:13,750 --> 00:10:15,040
You finally came out.

116
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:19,910
You're leaving?

117
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,700
Thank you, Shaojun, for taking care of me during this time.

118
00:10:30,660 --> 00:10:32,040
I'm returning to the Lin residence today.

119
00:10:33,370 --> 00:10:34,500
This divorce agreement—

120
00:10:35,250 --> 00:10:38,410
Once Shaojun has stamped it, I'll come back to collect it.

121
00:10:56,910 --> 00:10:57,700
Wait.

122
00:11:01,620 --> 00:11:03,200
I'll have someone deliver the divorce agreement.

123
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:07,790
Mingxuan

124
00:11:08,910 --> 00:11:10,660
Shaojun, what's going on with you?

125
00:11:10,700 --> 00:11:12,120
Weren't things fine just a few days ago?

126
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:13,750
How can you just decide to divorce like this?

127
00:11:14,830 --> 00:11:15,620
Mingxuan
