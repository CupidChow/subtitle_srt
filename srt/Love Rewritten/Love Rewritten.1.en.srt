1
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:18,870
Xiao Jingyang

2
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:22,540
Even if I have to die kneeling here today,

3
00:01:22,790 --> 00:01:24,080
I will never agree to a divorce.

4
00:01:55,700 --> 00:01:56,500
Lin Mingxuan

5
00:01:58,040 --> 00:01:59,870
Just to become the young lord's wife,

6
00:02:00,750 --> 00:02:02,580
you willingly endure such humiliation.

7
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:05,120
You were the one who said it.

8
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:07,450
To rely on each other for life,

9
00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:10,540
never to leave or abandon one another.

10
00:02:13,370 --> 00:02:14,200
A little higher.

11
00:02:14,750 --> 00:02:15,830
Brother Jingyang,

12
00:02:15,910 --> 00:02:17,040
a bit higher.

13
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:17,620
Be careful.

14
00:02:17,620 --> 00:02:18,830
Don't fall down.

15
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:22,700
Mingxuan,

16
00:02:23,580 --> 00:02:24,790
when you come of age,

17
00:02:24,790 --> 00:02:25,950
will you marry me?

18
00:02:26,620 --> 00:02:28,540
I, Xiao Jingyang, swear to the heavens today

19
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:31,250
that I will love only Lin Mingxuan in this lifetime.

20
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:34,750
We will rely on each other for life, never leaving or abandoning one another.

21
00:02:40,540 --> 00:02:42,540
It was just a childish promise.

22
00:02:43,910 --> 00:02:45,080
You actually took it seriously.

23
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:50,910
Tomorrow, I will marry General Wang's daughter as my official wife.

24
00:02:50,910 --> 00:02:52,450
I will welcome General Wang's daughter in marriage.

25
00:02:54,370 --> 00:02:55,540
If you stay here,

26
00:02:57,450 --> 00:02:58,660
she will misunderstand.

27
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:11,910
Xiao Jingyang!

28
00:03:14,540 --> 00:03:16,450
If I step out of the lord's residence today,

29
00:03:17,540 --> 00:03:19,200
don't expect me to ever return.

30
00:03:31,910 --> 00:03:32,700
Protect the young madam.

31
00:03:32,700 --> 00:03:33,370
Yes.

32
00:03:33,910 --> 00:03:34,700
Let's go.

33
00:03:34,700 --> 00:03:35,500
Xiao Jingyang!

34
00:04:07,660 --> 00:04:08,450
Mingxuan

35
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:17,040
Mingxuan

36
00:04:18,700 --> 00:04:20,040
Why did you come back?

37
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,330
Why did you save me?

38
00:04:22,660 --> 00:04:23,700
Xiao Jingyang

39
00:04:25,750 --> 00:04:26,830
In the next life,

40
00:04:27,750 --> 00:04:30,200
I will never love you again.

41
00:04:35,370 --> 00:04:36,160
Mingxuan

42
00:04:58,200 --> 00:04:59,000
Young City Lord

43
00:04:59,450 --> 00:05:01,040
Are you sure you want to do this all over again?

44
00:05:04,870 --> 00:05:05,660
Princess

45
00:05:06,330 --> 00:05:07,620
This is simply outrageous.

46
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,330
Even if you don't want to marry Miss Lin,

47
00:05:11,410 --> 00:05:13,450
you can't joke around with your own health.

48
00:05:14,580 --> 00:05:16,330
The Young Lord's health was never good to begin with.

49
00:05:16,450 --> 00:05:17,700
And yet he still acts so recklessly.

50
00:05:17,750 --> 00:05:19,540
As the person closest to him,

51
00:05:19,540 --> 00:05:20,870
how could you not stop him?

52
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:22,000
I know my mistake.

53
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:23,450
Please punish me, Princess.

54
00:05:24,580 --> 00:05:25,500
Go outside and kneel.

55
00:05:25,750 --> 00:05:27,000
As long as the Young Lord does not wake up,

56
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:28,330
you will not get up.

57
00:05:28,370 --> 00:05:29,160
Yes.

58
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:47,250
Princess Pingning

59
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:51,330
Jingyang, you're awake!

60
00:05:54,950 --> 00:05:56,700
Mingxuan greets Princess Pingning.

61
00:05:57,870 --> 00:05:58,700
Jingyang

62
00:05:58,830 --> 00:06:00,500
Look at me, I'm your sister.

63
00:06:00,870 --> 00:06:01,700
What's wrong with you?

64
00:06:02,950 --> 00:06:05,250
Why is the Princess calling me Jingyang?

65
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:10,750
Look at me.

66
00:06:10,750 --> 00:06:11,540
What's going on?

67
00:06:11,540 --> 00:06:12,250
Jingyang

68
00:06:20,830 --> 00:06:21,700
My face

69
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:26,410
How did it become Xiao Jingyang?

70
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:30,080
Xiao Jingyang

71
00:06:31,870 --> 00:06:33,870
Qiaoshan, Qiaoshan

72
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:35,040
Go get the doctor

73
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:35,700
Yes

74
00:06:36,700 --> 00:06:37,910
This must be a dream

75
00:06:38,750 --> 00:06:40,080
This must be a dream

76
00:06:41,370 --> 00:06:42,620
I must be dreaming

77
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:44,870
Jingyang, Jingyang

78
00:06:44,950 --> 00:06:45,660
What are you doing?

79
00:06:45,660 --> 00:06:46,540
You're not dreaming

80
00:06:46,540 --> 00:06:47,250
I'm your sister

81
00:06:47,250 --> 00:06:48,040
Where is Lin Mingxuan?

82
00:06:49,330 --> 00:06:50,450
Lin Mingxuan hasn't married in yet

83
00:06:50,450 --> 00:06:52,000
Of course she's at the Lin residence

84
00:06:52,370 --> 00:06:53,290
What's wrong with you?

85
00:06:56,540 --> 00:06:57,370
It seems that not only have I

86
00:06:57,370 --> 00:06:59,080
taken over Xiao Jingyang's body

87
00:06:59,080 --> 00:06:59,660
Jingyang

88
00:06:59,830 --> 00:07:01,830
but time has also gone back to before we got married

89
00:07:01,830 --> 00:07:03,040
Say something to me

90
00:07:05,250 --> 00:07:06,120
Sister

91
00:07:06,410 --> 00:07:08,330
While I was managing the household

92
00:07:08,330 --> 00:07:10,790
you actually tried to elope with someone else

93
00:07:11,620 --> 00:07:13,750
Fortunately, I found out in time

94
00:07:13,830 --> 00:07:14,750
Otherwise

95
00:07:14,950 --> 00:07:17,080
the whole Lin family would have been implicated

96
00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:21,870
Insolent.

97
00:07:23,500 --> 00:07:24,290
Jingyang.

98
00:07:24,700 --> 00:07:25,410
In your earlier years,

99
00:07:25,410 --> 00:07:27,330
you clearly liked that Lin family girl.

100
00:07:27,790 --> 00:07:29,580
So why, when it came time to marry her,

101
00:07:29,910 --> 00:07:30,910
did you actually do something like

102
00:07:30,910 --> 00:07:32,950
kneeling outside your father's hall all night?

103
00:07:32,950 --> 00:07:33,750
What?

104
00:07:33,910 --> 00:07:34,910
Do you know

105
00:07:34,910 --> 00:07:37,250
why your father insists you marry the Lin family girl?

106
00:07:37,910 --> 00:07:39,750
The court's power is deeply intertwined.

107
00:07:40,540 --> 00:07:43,250
The Lin family's support is very important.

108
00:07:43,660 --> 00:07:45,370
So he was being forced into marriage.

109
00:07:45,750 --> 00:07:46,830
Never leaving, never abandoning.

110
00:07:47,620 --> 00:07:48,500
Was that really just his empty promise?

111
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:49,000
Alright.

112
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:50,830
I'm fine.

113
00:07:51,580 --> 00:07:53,660
If I tell them I'm Lin Mingxuan,

114
00:07:53,950 --> 00:07:55,580
will they think I'm crazy?

115
00:07:56,700 --> 00:07:57,500
No, that won't do.

116
00:07:57,580 --> 00:07:59,250
I need to hurry and figure out what's going on.

117
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:00,660
Jingyang.

118
00:08:00,660 --> 00:08:01,500
What's really wrong with you?

119
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:01,700
Tell me.

120
00:08:01,700 --> 00:08:02,370
Wu Liuqi.

121
00:08:02,750 --> 00:08:03,910
Come with me to the Lin family.

122
00:08:04,250 --> 00:08:05,040
Wait.

123
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:07,200
You're still not fully recovered.

124
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:08,410
Why are you going to the Lin family?

125
00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:09,910
Sister.

126
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:12,540
Before, I was blind and foolish.

127
00:08:12,950 --> 00:08:14,750
Someone like the Lin family's eldest daughter,

128
00:08:14,750 --> 00:08:16,580
so clever, gentle, and gracious,

129
00:08:16,580 --> 00:08:17,910
a beauty like a fairy,

130
00:08:17,910 --> 00:08:18,790
I still looked down on her.

131
00:08:20,580 --> 00:08:21,790
I'll go and apologize right away.

132
00:08:26,950 --> 00:08:29,290
You really think you're the eldest Miss of the Lin family now.

133
00:08:29,290 --> 00:08:30,950
You even dare to snatch the whip from me.

134
00:08:31,290 --> 00:08:32,580
Just a mere servant,

135
00:08:32,580 --> 00:08:33,830
and you dare to defy your superiors.

136
00:08:33,950 --> 00:08:35,000
You're asking for death.

137
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:44,080
This body...

138
00:08:44,870 --> 00:08:46,000
is truly weak and frail.

139
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,830
Lin Mingxuan, you’ve really gone too far.

140
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:55,120
As the dignified second Miss of the Lin family,

141
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:57,160
you let an unruly servant punish your master.

142
00:08:57,160 --> 00:08:58,580
You’re really bold.

143
00:08:58,750 --> 00:09:00,750
You’re not even the Young City Lord’s wife yet,

144
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,120
and you’re already putting on airs like one.

145
00:09:03,330 --> 00:09:04,750
If the Young City Lord finds out

146
00:09:04,750 --> 00:09:06,620
that you eloped with someone else before the wedding,

147
00:09:06,700 --> 00:09:08,080
would he still marry you?

148
00:09:08,750 --> 00:09:09,540
Eloped?

149
00:09:10,290 --> 00:09:11,080
Bring her up.

150
00:09:16,250 --> 00:09:17,040
Second Miss

151
00:09:17,450 --> 00:09:18,540
Second Miss, it was her.

152
00:09:18,910 --> 00:09:20,250
She seduced me first.

153
00:09:20,660 --> 00:09:21,410
She said she didn't want to

154
00:09:21,410 --> 00:09:23,000
marry the young city lord, that sickly man.

155
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:24,370
She begged me to take her away.

156
00:09:24,870 --> 00:09:26,040
Second Miss, please spare me!

157
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:28,120
Sister, did you hear that?

158
00:09:28,330 --> 00:09:29,330
Lin Mingxuan

159
00:09:29,910 --> 00:09:31,450
Are you blind?

160
00:09:32,910 --> 00:09:34,580
Someone like him is worthy of me?

161
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:38,410
Is he even worthy to be compared to our young city lord?

162
00:09:38,450 --> 00:09:40,080
It's fine if you don't admit it.

163
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:41,750
When Father returns,

164
00:09:41,750 --> 00:09:43,200
I'll go with him

165
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:45,120
to escort you to the young city lord's residence to confess your crime.

166
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:48,000
Lin Mingxuan

167
00:09:48,290 --> 00:09:49,540
For your whole life,

168
00:09:49,700 --> 00:09:51,830
you'll have to live in my shadow.

169
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:55,250
And you still dream of becoming the young city lord's wife?

170
00:09:56,700 --> 00:09:58,410
Even if he's a sickly man,

171
00:09:59,700 --> 00:10:00,750
you're not worthy.

172
00:10:01,450 --> 00:10:02,910
Zilin, keep hitting her for me.

173
00:10:05,290 --> 00:10:05,950
Stop!

174
00:10:05,950 --> 00:10:06,620
Who is it?

175
00:10:13,950 --> 00:10:15,040
Greetings, Young Lord.

176
00:10:15,580 --> 00:10:16,370
Young Lord.

177
00:10:16,580 --> 00:10:17,660
Why are you here?

178
00:10:17,910 --> 00:10:19,080
If I hadn't come,

179
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:19,910
my fiancée

180
00:10:19,910 --> 00:10:21,250
would have been beaten to death by you.

181
00:10:22,290 --> 00:10:23,370
Minghua wouldn't dare.

182
00:10:27,750 --> 00:10:28,540
You hit her.

183
00:10:28,750 --> 00:10:29,870
Young City Lord, please forgive me.

184
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:30,950
It was this wretch—

185
00:10:30,950 --> 00:10:31,540
No.

186
00:10:31,540 --> 00:10:33,080
It was the young lady who went behind your back.

187
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:34,290
She secretly eloped with someone else.

188
00:10:34,290 --> 00:10:35,540
We discovered it.

189
00:10:35,580 --> 00:10:36,410
That's why—

190
00:10:36,540 --> 00:10:37,330
Eloped.

191
00:10:40,450 --> 00:10:41,790
Lin Mingxuan admitted it herself.

192
00:10:42,540 --> 00:10:43,330
It was me, the servant.

193
00:10:43,410 --> 00:10:44,910
I personally saw this person

194
00:10:44,910 --> 00:10:46,580
waiting for the young lady at the back courtyard gate.

195
00:10:46,580 --> 00:10:48,200
After being caught, he even admitted it himself.

196
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:49,580
He arranged to meet the young lady

197
00:10:49,580 --> 00:10:51,160
and run away together tonight.

198
00:10:51,870 --> 00:10:52,660
Is that so?

199
00:10:53,410 --> 00:10:54,080
Then this person

200
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:55,910
Since he has pledged his life to the young lady,

201
00:10:56,370 --> 00:10:57,160
he should also know

202
00:10:57,160 --> 00:10:59,080
the young lady's given name,

203
00:10:59,290 --> 00:11:00,330
her birth date and time,

204
00:11:00,580 --> 00:11:02,370
what she likes and dislikes.

205
00:11:02,870 --> 00:11:03,660
Tell us.

206
00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:07,410
I... I...

207
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:10,040
You just found someone and relied on one person's word

208
00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:11,580
to slander the master's reputation?

209
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:13,080
Your Lin family

210
00:11:13,370 --> 00:11:14,750
is this how you indulge your servants,

211
00:11:14,750 --> 00:11:16,000
letting them defy their superiors?

212
00:11:17,870 --> 00:11:19,000
Zilin, you wretched maid,

213
00:11:19,290 --> 00:11:20,580
how dare you defy your superiors

214
00:11:20,580 --> 00:11:21,660
and slander your master?

215
00:11:23,950 --> 00:11:24,910
It's all Minghua's fault.

216
00:11:24,910 --> 00:11:26,250
She believed slander for a moment.

217
00:11:27,410 --> 00:11:28,790
She made you suffer injustice, sister.

218
00:11:28,870 --> 00:11:30,200
Even if it was a misunderstanding,

219
00:11:30,450 --> 00:11:31,830
my fiancée

220
00:11:31,950 --> 00:11:34,000
should not have to suffer such injustice for no reason.

221
00:11:34,870 --> 00:11:35,660
Someone, come!

222
00:11:35,750 --> 00:11:36,910
Zilin has overstepped her rank

223
00:11:36,910 --> 00:11:37,500
and slandered her master.

224
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:38,080
Miss, spare me!

225
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:39,330
Drag her out and give her twenty strokes.

226
00:11:39,330 --> 00:11:40,000
Miss!

227
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,080
Minghua will carry out the punishment herself.

228
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:42,830
Miss!

229
00:11:43,290 --> 00:11:44,250
Second Miss!

230
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:45,580
Wu Liuqi.

231
00:11:45,700 --> 00:11:46,080
Here.

232
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:46,540
Second Miss, please save me!

233
00:11:46,700 --> 00:11:47,660
Go and keep an eye on it for me.

234
00:11:47,950 --> 00:11:48,950
Make sure it's twenty strokes,

235
00:11:48,950 --> 00:11:49,910
not one less.

236
00:11:49,910 --> 00:11:50,750
Yes.

237
00:11:58,870 --> 00:11:59,750
Xiao Jingyang.

238
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:01,080
Lin Mingxuan.

239
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:03,080
It really is you.

240
00:12:04,250 --> 00:12:05,580
Just now, my act as the young city lord

241
00:12:05,580 --> 00:12:06,540
was pretty convincing, right?

242
00:12:07,250 --> 00:12:08,080
Let me see quickly.

243
00:12:09,250 --> 00:12:10,330
Are you looking for trouble?
