1
00:01:11,750 --> 00:01:13,330
Xiao Jingyang, what are you doing?

2
00:01:13,330 --> 00:01:14,910
Didn't we agree on this before?

3
00:01:16,160 --> 00:01:17,580
You... you can't use

4
00:01:17,580 --> 00:01:19,120
the body swap as an excuse to take advantage of me.

5
00:01:19,160 --> 00:01:20,290
Xiao Jingyang, I'm warning you.

6
00:01:20,290 --> 00:01:20,500
Don't move.

7
00:01:20,500 --> 00:01:21,790
Don't do anything reckless.

8
00:01:32,910 --> 00:01:33,750
Don't mess with me.

9
00:01:47,080 --> 00:01:48,580
You jerk, Xiao Jingyang!

10
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:50,540
How dare you try to seduce me!

11
00:01:56,250 --> 00:01:57,040
Wait, that's not right.

12
00:01:57,950 --> 00:01:59,370
How did we switch back?

13
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:05,200
The girl is awake.

14
00:02:05,830 --> 00:02:07,580
The divine doctor's skills truly live up to the reputation.

15
00:02:08,950 --> 00:02:10,450
Jingyang has one more request.

16
00:02:11,370 --> 00:02:12,750
Considering your deep feelings for my girl,

17
00:02:12,750 --> 00:02:14,370
out of respect for your devotion,

18
00:02:15,540 --> 00:02:16,450
Go ahead, speak.

19
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:20,040
Please, divine doctor, save the people of Liucheng.

20
00:02:21,660 --> 00:02:24,450
I thought you would ask me to save yourself.

21
00:02:24,450 --> 00:02:26,370
I know my own condition best.

22
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:28,790
Please don't tell Mingxuan.

23
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:31,910
Fine.

24
00:02:32,790 --> 00:02:33,950
Rest for another day.

25
00:02:34,830 --> 00:02:37,580
Wait until the girl's body has recovered before leaving.

26
00:02:37,700 --> 00:02:38,580
Thank you, divine doctor.

27
00:02:52,830 --> 00:02:54,660
When did you become Doctor Luo's apprentice?

28
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:56,250
You never mentioned it before.

29
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,370
It was when I was eight years old.

30
00:02:58,580 --> 00:03:00,250
Lin Minghua tricked me into going up the mountain.

31
00:03:00,410 --> 00:03:01,790
Then pushed me down.

32
00:03:02,330 --> 00:03:03,910
Then my master saved me.

33
00:03:07,870 --> 00:03:09,580
That must have hurt a lot.

34
00:03:10,250 --> 00:03:11,040
It was okay.

35
00:03:11,830 --> 00:03:13,040
After I got home,

36
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:14,290
I gave her some medicine.

37
00:03:14,540 --> 00:03:16,450
It made her have diarrhea for three days and nights.

38
00:03:20,450 --> 00:03:21,750
That’s definitely Lin Mingxuan.

39
00:03:32,540 --> 00:03:33,580
There's something on your head.

40
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:43,080
Lin Mingxuan, oh Lin Mingxuan

41
00:03:43,830 --> 00:03:45,540
Why are you so useless?

42
00:03:46,580 --> 00:03:48,870
You got flustered so easily.

43
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,700
But I never expected

44
00:03:54,250 --> 00:03:55,410
that the way to switch our bodies back

45
00:03:55,410 --> 00:03:56,500
would be a life for a life.

46
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,080
Thinking about it, it makes sense.

47
00:04:00,700 --> 00:04:03,290
In our previous life, I took an arrow for you.

48
00:04:04,290 --> 00:04:06,500
And in this life, you did the same for me.

49
00:04:09,620 --> 00:04:10,410
That's fine.

50
00:04:11,830 --> 00:04:13,580
Our bodies have to be switched back eventually.

51
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:15,120
A life for a life.

52
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:17,950
After this, we won't owe each other anything.

53
00:04:19,410 --> 00:04:20,200
Mingxuan

54
00:04:20,250 --> 00:04:21,120
Don't worry.

55
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:23,660
Once the epidemic in Liucheng is over,

56
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:25,450
we'll go back and get a divorce.

57
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:34,040
I won't bother you anymore.

58
00:04:36,250 --> 00:04:38,330
Let's wait until we consult the High Priest back at the manor.

59
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:41,000
The High Priest

60
00:04:42,290 --> 00:04:44,910
is the one who knows all the Miao sorcery

61
00:04:45,700 --> 00:04:47,870
and can also glimpse fate.

62
00:04:49,750 --> 00:04:50,910
What are you going to ask him?

63
00:04:54,410 --> 00:04:55,790
You'll find out in the future.

64
00:04:56,750 --> 00:04:58,580
Xiao Jingyang, wait for me!

65
00:05:09,620 --> 00:05:10,410
Young Lord

66
00:05:10,620 --> 00:05:11,660
I received your message,

67
00:05:11,660 --> 00:05:12,700
so I waited here right away.

68
00:05:12,700 --> 00:05:13,830
How are things in Liucheng?

69
00:05:13,870 --> 00:05:15,160
As you instructed,

70
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:16,500
I went to Liucheng to provide aid yesterday,

71
00:05:16,910 --> 00:05:18,330
but I was stopped outside the city gates.

72
00:05:18,450 --> 00:05:19,870
I never saw the Second Young Lord at all.

73
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:21,660
Instead, over at the mass grave,

74
00:05:21,660 --> 00:05:22,870
news spread from inside the city

75
00:05:22,950 --> 00:05:24,410
that they plan to set the mass grave on fire.

76
00:05:24,620 --> 00:05:25,410
What?

77
00:05:25,620 --> 00:05:26,950
Qiangqiang is still over there!

78
00:05:27,370 --> 00:05:28,620
There are so many people there, too.

79
00:05:28,620 --> 00:05:29,330
Don't worry.

80
00:05:29,830 --> 00:05:31,660
I will save Wang Yiqiang and the people of Liucheng.

81
00:05:32,700 --> 00:05:33,500
Wu Liuqi

82
00:05:33,540 --> 00:05:34,580
Prepare a fast horse.

83
00:05:34,580 --> 00:05:35,250
Yes.

84
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:37,500
You have no regard for your life.

85
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:39,950
Since you want to die with them,

86
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:41,370
I'll grant your wish.

87
00:05:41,660 --> 00:05:42,580
Get ready to set the fire.

88
00:05:42,750 --> 00:05:43,290
Yes.

89
00:05:43,290 --> 00:05:44,580
Let me see who dares to set the fire!

90
00:05:48,450 --> 00:05:50,410
Young Lord, you finally returned!

91
00:05:53,750 --> 00:05:54,290
Young Lord!

92
00:05:54,290 --> 00:05:55,160
The Young Lord's head illness has flared up again.

93
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:56,080
What's wrong, Young Lord?

94
00:05:56,370 --> 00:05:57,160
Young Lord!

95
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:01,660
Master

96
00:06:01,660 --> 00:06:02,950
How is Xiao Jingyang?

97
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,330
It's been suppressed for now.

98
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:10,870
Master

99
00:06:11,540 --> 00:06:13,160
Lately, his headaches have been occurring frequently.

100
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:15,000
Is there any way to cure it?

101
00:06:15,330 --> 00:06:16,200
Headache

102
00:06:16,540 --> 00:06:18,000
He makes it sound simple.

103
00:06:19,580 --> 00:06:20,660
Isn't it?

104
00:06:21,660 --> 00:06:23,540
It's not a headache at all.

105
00:06:23,830 --> 00:06:25,540
He was poisoned by someone.

106
00:06:26,290 --> 00:06:27,080
What?

107
00:06:28,950 --> 00:06:31,700
The one who poisoned him doesn't want him to survive.

108
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:33,450
To cure this kind of poison,

109
00:06:33,620 --> 00:06:35,000
you must know

110
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:38,580
how many and which poisons were used,

111
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:41,410
and in what order they were combined.

112
00:06:42,750 --> 00:06:45,870
Only then can you create the antidote.

113
00:06:46,330 --> 00:06:48,700
Even you, Master,

114
00:06:48,700 --> 00:06:50,370
can't solve this?

115
00:06:52,580 --> 00:06:53,410
Based on the current situation,

116
00:06:53,410 --> 00:06:56,080
the rate at which his organs are being corroded,

117
00:06:56,540 --> 00:06:57,330
I'm afraid

118
00:06:58,750 --> 00:07:00,040
he won't live more than two years.

119
00:07:05,790 --> 00:07:06,700
Xiao Jingyang

120
00:07:08,250 --> 00:07:09,500
How could this happen?

121
00:07:10,580 --> 00:07:12,700
I've already sealed some of his acupoints.

122
00:07:12,950 --> 00:07:15,620
This can slow the onset of the poison.

123
00:07:17,080 --> 00:07:18,450
As for how long he can last,

124
00:07:19,580 --> 00:07:21,620
that depends on his fate.

125
00:07:50,700 --> 00:07:51,700
In the previous life,

126
00:07:53,290 --> 00:07:55,410
you must have known your own condition.

127
00:07:56,870 --> 00:07:58,790
That's why you divorced me, right?

128
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:01,830
But

129
00:08:03,700 --> 00:08:04,660
in this life,

130
00:08:06,950 --> 00:08:09,500
why did you make me fall in love with you again?

131
00:08:14,250 --> 00:08:15,040
Ming Xuan

132
00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:19,580
Jingyang, I'm here.

133
00:09:27,580 --> 00:09:28,750
What's wrong? Why are you so flustered?

134
00:09:29,410 --> 00:09:30,500
What happened?

135
00:09:31,330 --> 00:09:32,830
N-nothing.

136
00:09:33,870 --> 00:09:35,700
Why is your face so red?

137
00:09:36,750 --> 00:09:37,700
Is it really that red?

138
00:09:38,950 --> 00:09:40,120
Don't make things up.

139
00:09:48,250 --> 00:09:49,120
I get it.

140
00:09:49,410 --> 00:09:50,450
I won't bother you two anymore.

141
00:09:51,950 --> 00:09:52,790
Qiangqiang.

142
00:09:54,870 --> 00:09:55,750
What did you just call me?

143
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:57,120
Qiangqiang.

144
00:09:58,290 --> 00:09:59,830
You're acting really strange.

145
00:10:00,910 --> 00:10:03,500
You used to ignore me.

146
00:10:03,620 --> 00:10:05,500
But today you're suddenly so friendly.

147
00:10:06,790 --> 00:10:07,580
Tell me.

148
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:10,040
Did you do something you feel guilty about?

149
00:10:10,620 --> 00:10:11,790
I almost forgot.

150
00:10:11,790 --> 00:10:14,500
The only one who used to call her "Qiangqiang" so affectionately

151
00:10:14,500 --> 00:10:16,330
was me, when I was in Xiao Jingyang's body.

152
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:18,540
I do have something to ask you.

153
00:10:19,330 --> 00:10:20,410
Just tell me if you'll help or not.

154
00:10:20,410 --> 00:10:21,080
I'll help.

155
00:10:21,370 --> 00:10:24,700
You're much cuter today than before.

156
00:10:33,830 --> 00:10:34,750
No problem.

157
00:10:35,540 --> 00:10:37,120
Leave it to me.

158
00:10:41,370 --> 00:10:42,160
You look ridiculous.

159
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:51,870
Why aren't you wearing any clothes?

160
00:10:56,660 --> 00:10:58,750
Is there any part of me you haven't seen?

161
00:10:59,540 --> 00:11:00,870
Now you know how to be shy?

162
00:11:02,330 --> 00:11:03,250
That's different.

163
00:11:03,620 --> 00:11:05,950
I always thought of myself as a guy.

164
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:11,790
But when I was in your body,

165
00:11:12,620 --> 00:11:14,500
I never thought of myself as a woman.

166
00:11:15,830 --> 00:11:17,790
What do you mean, "when you were in my body"?

167
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:18,910
Xiao Jingyang.

168
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:20,330
Can you be more careful with your words?

169
00:11:23,950 --> 00:11:24,790
What's wrong with what I said?

170
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:45,910
You have no shame.
