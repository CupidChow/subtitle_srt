1
00:01:11,830 --> 00:01:13,120
Mingxuan went to the inn.

2
00:01:14,790 --> 00:01:17,660
Where she goes has nothing to do with me.

3
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:19,450
But I heard

4
00:01:19,950 --> 00:01:22,790
the inn is hosting a singles' mixer today.

5
00:01:28,750 --> 00:01:29,540
Let her do as she pleases.

6
00:01:29,540 --> 00:01:32,080
But I heard

7
00:01:32,370 --> 00:01:34,250
the one meeting the young madam today

8
00:01:34,250 --> 00:01:36,660
is a certain Young Master Li, who is quite a playboy.

9
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:38,330
He isn't even married yet,

10
00:01:38,410 --> 00:01:40,910
but already has five or six concubines.

11
00:01:42,580 --> 00:01:44,790
They say that Young Master Li

12
00:01:44,870 --> 00:01:46,870
is very humorous and charming.

13
00:01:46,910 --> 00:01:49,750
What if Mingxuan really takes a liking to him?

14
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,000
If she wants to remarry,

15
00:01:51,830 --> 00:01:53,540
I will naturally send her a wedding gift.

16
00:01:56,790 --> 00:01:57,660
And congratulate her.

17
00:02:01,790 --> 00:02:02,370
Young Lord,

18
00:02:02,370 --> 00:02:03,450
from now on, her matters

19
00:02:04,540 --> 00:02:05,750
need not be reported to me.

20
00:02:08,450 --> 00:02:10,910
Why is this so different from how it goes in the storybooks?

21
00:02:11,830 --> 00:02:13,620
Shouldn't he be getting jealous,

22
00:02:13,700 --> 00:02:15,410
cornering her against the wall,

23
00:02:15,830 --> 00:02:17,910
and saying, "Woman,

24
00:02:18,870 --> 00:02:20,790
you belong to me"?

25
00:02:22,290 --> 00:02:23,080
You...

26
00:02:23,700 --> 00:02:24,910
Do you really think the Young Lord

27
00:02:24,910 --> 00:02:26,660
is the same as those vulgar men in the storybooks?

28
00:02:26,660 --> 00:02:27,660
Just the same?

29
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:29,950
Ridiculous.

30
00:02:33,410 --> 00:02:34,540
Isn't he?

31
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,750
You must be Young Master Li.

32
00:03:11,870 --> 00:03:12,620
Young Lord,

33
00:03:12,620 --> 00:03:13,200
go and find out

34
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:13,950
who is meeting with the young madam

35
00:03:13,950 --> 00:03:15,370
today, this Young Master Li.

36
00:03:15,870 --> 00:03:18,410
Be sure to investigate his family background and character.

37
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:19,950
Right now?

38
00:03:19,950 --> 00:03:20,870
Is there a problem?

39
00:03:21,450 --> 00:03:22,330
No, no.

40
00:03:23,290 --> 00:03:25,120
You just said it had nothing to do with you.

41
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:26,120
What are you mumbling about?

42
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:26,830
Nothing.

43
00:03:26,830 --> 00:03:28,750
Young Lord, don't worry.

44
00:03:28,950 --> 00:03:31,000
I will make sure to investigate everything thoroughly.

45
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:33,660
Even how many eggs their chickens lay in a day

46
00:03:33,660 --> 00:03:35,080
will be investigated clearly.

47
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:21,410
You found out so quickly.

48
00:04:21,450 --> 00:04:22,910
Young Lord, something has happened.

49
00:04:26,660 --> 00:04:27,450
Young Lord.

50
00:04:28,290 --> 00:04:29,370
He is the one who today

51
00:04:29,370 --> 00:04:31,200
was supposed to have a matchmaking meeting with Mingxuan, Young Master Li.

52
00:04:31,790 --> 00:04:33,410
I don't know why he showed up here.

53
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:35,370
If something happens to him,

54
00:04:36,290 --> 00:04:37,160
then Mingxuan...

55
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:38,290
Go to the inn.

56
00:04:47,870 --> 00:04:49,000
Who exactly are you?

57
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:06,950
Third Brother.

58
00:05:08,580 --> 00:05:09,750
What do you mean by this?

59
00:05:19,660 --> 00:05:20,910
Where is Lin Mingxuan?

60
00:05:21,410 --> 00:05:23,330
Isn't Lin Mingxuan supposed to be at the Lin residence?

61
00:05:23,330 --> 00:05:24,330
Stop pretending to be confused.

62
00:05:25,620 --> 00:05:27,200
Xiao Jingyu, look carefully.

63
00:05:27,910 --> 00:05:30,120
Is this your personal seal on it?

64
00:05:35,330 --> 00:05:36,830
This is indeed my personal seal.

65
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:39,450
But I really don't know anything about this.

66
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:42,330
No matter what, Lin Mingxuan is the Young City Lord's wife.

67
00:05:42,330 --> 00:05:43,370
She is my sister-in-law.

68
00:05:43,870 --> 00:05:45,750
I would never do something like kidnapping her.

69
00:05:53,450 --> 00:05:54,290
Young Lord.

70
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:56,160
Young Master Li has woken up.

71
00:05:56,450 --> 00:05:58,950
He said that before he lost consciousness, he heard the attacker say

72
00:06:00,790 --> 00:06:02,500
"Second Young Master, the matter is settled."

73
00:06:02,580 --> 00:06:03,830
This is clearly a setup.

74
00:06:06,660 --> 00:06:08,790
If you dare hurt her even a little,

75
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:10,790
I will make you pay with your life.

76
00:06:23,410 --> 00:06:24,290
Second Miss

77
00:06:26,370 --> 00:06:27,250
Zilin, look.

78
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:30,750
Does my wedding dress look nice?

79
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:32,750
Of course, it's extremely beautiful.

80
00:06:33,330 --> 00:06:34,450
What a pity, though.

81
00:06:35,410 --> 00:06:38,120
It's still not as dazzling as the City Lord's wife's wedding dress.

82
00:06:38,410 --> 00:06:39,870
That one was so brilliant and eye-catching.

83
00:06:40,660 --> 00:06:41,870
Is there any news from over there?

84
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,660
Just as you predicted, Second Miss.

85
00:06:43,790 --> 00:06:46,120
Xiao Jingyang really did go to the Second Young Master's residence.

86
00:06:46,330 --> 00:06:47,160
By the way,

87
00:06:48,580 --> 00:06:51,160
Remember to stir things up with Lin Mingxuan.

88
00:06:51,250 --> 00:06:54,200
There's no need to keep useless things around.

89
00:06:54,330 --> 00:06:55,160
Yes.

90
00:07:14,580 --> 00:07:15,750
If it really was you,

91
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,910
I would have been prepared for this sword attack.

92
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:23,330
So, you believe me now?

93
00:07:23,330 --> 00:07:24,450
Even if it wasn't you,

94
00:07:25,450 --> 00:07:27,870
it's still connected to someone close to you.

95
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:28,790
Don't worry.

96
00:07:29,700 --> 00:07:31,040
I'll investigate right away.

97
00:07:31,870 --> 00:07:34,750
I really want to see who has the guts to do this.

98
00:07:34,790 --> 00:07:35,580
Yes.

99
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:40,000
Third Brother, don't worry.

100
00:07:40,540 --> 00:07:43,080
I'll definitely give you an explanation for this matter.

101
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:43,540
Young Lord

102
00:07:43,540 --> 00:07:44,700
The Second Young Master's residence has already

103
00:07:44,700 --> 00:07:46,200
been completely surrounded.

104
00:07:46,250 --> 00:07:47,540
There are people watching every corner inside the residence.

105
00:07:47,540 --> 00:07:49,080
Not even a fly could get out.

106
00:07:55,910 --> 00:07:57,040
Go and follow Zhulan.

107
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:11,410
Since you're so worried about her,

108
00:08:11,870 --> 00:08:13,160
why did you still want a divorce?

109
00:08:15,660 --> 00:08:17,160
Fine, I won't ask.

110
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:40,790
You're awake.

111
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:45,250
You went to so much trouble to kidnap me.

112
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:46,950
Was it for money?

113
00:08:56,950 --> 00:08:58,200
You're not doing this for money.

114
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:01,120
Who are you, really?

115
00:09:01,910 --> 00:09:05,040
As expected of the young lord's wife.

116
00:09:05,410 --> 00:09:06,290
So clever.

117
00:09:06,750 --> 00:09:08,370
Since you know who I am,

118
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,450
then you should also know

119
00:09:11,870 --> 00:09:13,750
that Xiao Jingyang and I are already divorced.

120
00:09:13,750 --> 00:09:15,040
Don't try to fool me.

121
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:16,540
During the epidemic in Liucheng,

122
00:09:16,540 --> 00:09:18,160
you risked your life to save him.

123
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:19,870
How could he bear to divorce you?

124
00:09:20,790 --> 00:09:21,950
It's because of you all

125
00:09:21,950 --> 00:09:23,540
that I lost my official position.

126
00:09:23,540 --> 00:09:24,910
I almost died in prison, too.

127
00:09:24,910 --> 00:09:26,750
I was just following orders.

128
00:09:26,750 --> 00:09:28,700
But you destroyed everything I had.

129
00:09:28,700 --> 00:09:29,250
Why?

130
00:09:29,250 --> 00:09:30,790
You are the magistrate of Liucheng.

131
00:09:32,750 --> 00:09:33,540
Clever.

132
00:09:34,250 --> 00:09:37,200
But clever people never live long.

133
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:39,910
You brought all this upon yourself.

134
00:09:40,250 --> 00:09:41,500
As the magistrate,

135
00:09:41,500 --> 00:09:42,620
you aided the wicked.

136
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:44,410
You let the epidemic spread unchecked.

137
00:09:44,410 --> 00:09:45,540
You treated people's lives as worthless.

138
00:09:45,580 --> 00:09:47,200
You are not fit to be an official at all.

139
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:47,950
Shut up!

140
00:09:48,910 --> 00:09:49,750
I was just

141
00:09:49,750 --> 00:09:52,120
a pawn in your power games.

142
00:09:52,290 --> 00:09:53,830
Even if I die today,

143
00:09:53,830 --> 00:09:55,830
I'll take you down with me.

144
00:09:56,500 --> 00:09:57,950
What are you trying to do?

145
00:10:00,910 --> 00:10:03,500
I want to see the lofty Young Lord.

146
00:10:03,540 --> 00:10:07,620
And his own brother turn against each other.

147
00:10:10,540 --> 00:10:11,450
Who do you think you are?

148
00:10:12,870 --> 00:10:14,830
Your schemes will never succeed.

149
00:10:16,290 --> 00:10:17,120
Yes.

150
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:19,910
Right now, I'm just a commoner.

151
00:10:20,450 --> 00:10:22,120
Of course, I'm nothing.

152
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:25,040
But if news of the Young Lord's wife's disappearance

153
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:26,750
spreads to the city,

154
00:10:27,540 --> 00:10:30,830
I'm afraid it will cause chaos.

155
00:10:35,660 --> 00:10:36,620
Look,

156
00:10:37,250 --> 00:10:39,290
everyone is already on stage now.

157
00:10:39,580 --> 00:10:41,080
I really want to see with my own eyes

158
00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:43,200
how they turn on each other.

159
00:10:43,540 --> 00:10:45,910
See how, because of you,

160
00:10:47,250 --> 00:10:49,250
they'll kill each other until rivers of blood flow.

161
00:10:51,910 --> 00:10:53,620
You lunatic!

162
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:55,000
Madman!

163
00:10:59,620 --> 00:11:00,790
Young Lord's wife.

164
00:11:01,870 --> 00:11:02,830
Don't worry.

165
00:11:04,540 --> 00:11:07,410
Very soon, on the road to the afterlife,

166
00:11:08,790 --> 00:11:09,830
you'll be reunited with them.

167
00:11:13,450 --> 00:11:14,660
You'll meet them again.
