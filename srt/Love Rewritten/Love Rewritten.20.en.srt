1
00:01:25,790 --> 00:01:27,950
Bring Xiao Jingyang and the ministers who support him

2
00:01:27,950 --> 00:01:29,120
here together.

3
00:01:30,790 --> 00:01:32,450
I want them to see

4
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:35,450
how I came to sit in this position.

5
00:01:56,910 --> 00:01:57,750
Elder sister,

6
00:01:58,330 --> 00:02:00,080
I've brought everyone you wanted.

7
00:02:10,580 --> 00:02:11,620
Xiao Jingyu

8
00:02:12,330 --> 00:02:14,120
I thought you had escaped.

9
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:17,040
I didn't expect you to be hiding here all along.

10
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:18,290
That's all thanks to

11
00:02:19,370 --> 00:02:21,450
that dog by your elder sister's side.

12
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:23,250
What do you mean?

13
00:02:23,540 --> 00:02:25,750
You used Father's name as a pretense to call me here.

14
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:28,870
But in reality, you wanted to use me as bait to lure our third brother.

15
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,500
So you could kill us both together.

16
00:02:30,870 --> 00:02:32,160
If I hadn't recognized Zhulan,

17
00:02:32,410 --> 00:02:33,870
I never would have guessed

18
00:02:34,330 --> 00:02:36,410
that you are actually the one behind him.

19
00:02:37,910 --> 00:02:41,660
And the real culprit behind Minghua's death.

20
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:46,580
That's because she was foolish.

21
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:49,040
All I did was tell her

22
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:51,410
that I would help you become the city lord.

23
00:02:51,410 --> 00:02:53,250
And make her the city lord's wife.

24
00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:55,660
She then acted like a dog,

25
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:57,450
obeying my every command.

26
00:02:57,450 --> 00:02:58,250
Xiao Wenxi

27
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:04,830
I won't allow you to insult her like this.

28
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:07,000
That was the path she chose herself.

29
00:03:07,250 --> 00:03:09,120
I only gave her a little push.

30
00:03:09,250 --> 00:03:10,450
In your eyes,

31
00:03:10,950 --> 00:03:12,000
other people's lives

32
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
are just stepping stones for your rise to power.

33
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:16,870
But even if you scheme endlessly,

34
00:03:17,830 --> 00:03:19,500
in the end, you'll have nothing.

35
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:21,450
Is it really worth it?

36
00:03:21,790 --> 00:03:22,870
You're wrong.

37
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:25,450
After today,

38
00:03:26,330 --> 00:03:28,620
I will have everything.

39
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:30,250
Not anymore.

40
00:03:33,540 --> 00:03:35,450
Everyone you planted here

41
00:03:35,830 --> 00:03:37,620
has already been removed by us.

42
00:03:38,450 --> 00:03:39,250
Elder sister,

43
00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:41,700
you won't become the city lord today.

44
00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:43,330
And from now on,

45
00:03:44,830 --> 00:03:47,200
you'll never have the chance to take this position.

46
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:50,910
Guards!

47
00:04:03,870 --> 00:04:06,910
So you were prepared all along.

48
00:04:06,910 --> 00:04:08,080
Ever since the day you poisoned me,

49
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:09,500
you've been plotting and scheming.

50
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:11,330
But I

51
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:15,250
was ahead of you, much earlier than you thought.

52
00:04:16,830 --> 00:04:17,620
Young Lord,

53
00:04:17,950 --> 00:04:19,290
we've tracked down Zhu Lan's whereabouts.

54
00:04:19,290 --> 00:04:20,870
He went to Princess Pingning's residence.

55
00:04:20,870 --> 00:04:21,700
Elder Sister,

56
00:04:21,830 --> 00:04:23,200
as you instructed,

57
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:24,500
during the raid on the Lin residence,

58
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:25,660
I deliberately placed

59
00:04:25,660 --> 00:04:26,790
tracking incense on Zhu Lan.

60
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:28,450
I followed the trail,

61
00:04:28,450 --> 00:04:30,040
and indeed saw him enter the princess's residence.

62
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:31,080
He hasn't come out since.

63
00:04:31,290 --> 00:04:32,080
Wu Liuqi,

64
00:04:32,620 --> 00:04:34,750
gather the shadow guards and secretly deploy them at the city lord's mansion.

65
00:04:34,790 --> 00:04:36,580
Remember, be cautious of Zhu Lan.

66
00:04:36,580 --> 00:04:37,290
Yes.

67
00:04:39,750 --> 00:04:41,200
Please trouble Teacher to make a trip for me.

68
00:04:41,370 --> 00:04:42,540
Inform all the ministers.

69
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:57,120
Zhu Lan has been by Second Brother's side for so many years.

70
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:00,660
Even if he wears a mask and disguises his voice,

71
00:05:01,370 --> 00:05:03,200
Second Brother would still recognize him.

72
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:10,540
Winner takes all, loser gets nothing.

73
00:05:11,620 --> 00:05:12,950
Kill me or torture me,

74
00:05:15,290 --> 00:05:16,830
do as you please.

75
00:05:17,330 --> 00:05:18,120
Guards!

76
00:05:24,580 --> 00:05:26,120
Take Princess Pingning

77
00:05:28,580 --> 00:05:29,620
into custody!

78
00:05:37,790 --> 00:05:38,580
Young Madam,

79
00:05:38,580 --> 00:05:39,370
Ming Xuan.

80
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:48,000
Let the princess go.

81
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:50,540
Or I'll take her life.

82
00:05:51,540 --> 00:05:52,330
Princess.

83
00:05:52,790 --> 00:05:53,790
I arrived late.

84
00:05:54,290 --> 00:05:55,500
Sorry you had to suffer.

85
00:05:56,330 --> 00:05:57,120
Zhulan.

86
00:05:57,410 --> 00:05:58,790
You're actually still alive.

87
00:05:59,540 --> 00:06:01,250
You want to avenge Wang Yiqiang.

88
00:06:01,950 --> 00:06:03,540
You can have my life.

89
00:06:04,250 --> 00:06:06,040
But you must let us go today.

90
00:06:06,540 --> 00:06:07,790
What makes you think you have the right

91
00:06:07,790 --> 00:06:08,870
to negotiate with me?

92
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:12,250
That depends

93
00:06:13,580 --> 00:06:15,620
on how much she means to the young master.

94
00:06:16,250 --> 00:06:17,870
Just try to hurt her.

95
00:06:19,580 --> 00:06:20,370
Step aside.

96
00:06:29,330 --> 00:06:31,080
Princess, let's go.

97
00:06:35,330 --> 00:06:36,120
Let's go.

98
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,120
Go where?

99
00:06:40,750 --> 00:06:41,660
The world is vast.

100
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:43,580
There will always be a place for us.

101
00:06:50,370 --> 00:06:51,290
Let me go with you

102
00:06:51,290 --> 00:06:52,790
and live a wandering life?

103
00:06:58,870 --> 00:07:00,290
Who do you think you are?

104
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:04,290
You're just a pawn to me.

105
00:07:05,290 --> 00:07:06,540
Why would I go with you?

106
00:07:12,870 --> 00:07:13,700
Princess.

107
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:36,290
Useless thing.

108
00:07:45,250 --> 00:07:46,330
Lock her up.

109
00:07:46,330 --> 00:07:47,000
Yes.

110
00:07:47,580 --> 00:07:48,370
Wait.

111
00:07:56,870 --> 00:07:58,580
Hand over the antidote for the poison.

112
00:07:59,290 --> 00:08:00,500
There is no antidote.

113
00:08:01,620 --> 00:08:02,450
Impossible.

114
00:08:03,830 --> 00:08:05,160
My master told me

115
00:08:05,870 --> 00:08:08,580
As long as you know the ingredients and the order to make the poison,

116
00:08:09,370 --> 00:08:11,370
you can definitely develop an antidote.

117
00:08:12,410 --> 00:08:14,450
Did your master ever tell you

118
00:08:14,660 --> 00:08:16,870
that once the poison reaches the vital organs,

119
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,660
even if you create an antidote,

120
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,120
it will be useless?

121
00:08:25,700 --> 00:08:28,580
Xiao Jingyang has been poisoned for five years already.

122
00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:33,000
The poison has already seeped into his flesh and blood.

123
00:08:33,370 --> 00:08:35,290
If you forcefully expel the poison,

124
00:08:36,750 --> 00:08:38,080
he will die.

125
00:08:39,450 --> 00:08:40,290
You're lying!

126
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:42,950
My master is a miracle doctor.

127
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,410
If he says he can save him, then he definitely can.

128
00:08:44,410 --> 00:08:46,830
Mingxuan, calm down.

129
00:08:47,910 --> 00:08:49,410
How do you expect me to calm down?

130
00:08:52,580 --> 00:08:54,370
You're her own brother,

131
00:08:55,540 --> 00:08:56,870
yet she could be so heartless

132
00:08:56,870 --> 00:08:58,540
as to poison you so cruelly.

133
00:08:59,790 --> 00:09:01,660
And now you're telling me there's no antidote.

134
00:09:06,870 --> 00:09:07,870
Xiao Jingyang.

135
00:09:09,540 --> 00:09:11,450
So what if you say you've won?

136
00:09:12,870 --> 00:09:14,660
Given your current condition,

137
00:09:14,790 --> 00:09:16,290
you don't have much time left.

138
00:09:17,660 --> 00:09:19,750
You'll still have to follow your sister to the afterlife.

139
00:09:20,750 --> 00:09:21,540
Take them away.

140
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:24,370
Just try and touch me.
