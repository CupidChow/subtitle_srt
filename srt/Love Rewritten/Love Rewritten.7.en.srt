1
00:01:12,410 --> 00:01:13,290
Dog man.

2
00:01:13,330 --> 00:01:15,250
Why did your style change after switching back to your body?

3
00:01:17,750 --> 00:01:19,370
It’s only been one night.

4
00:01:19,950 --> 00:01:21,450
What happened again?

5
00:01:23,080 --> 00:01:26,000
Your face is even redder than yesterday.

6
00:01:28,660 --> 00:01:30,950
That’s because it’s too hot today.

7
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:32,830
Hot?

8
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:36,000
Why do I feel it’s a bit chilly?

9
00:01:36,540 --> 00:01:37,750
Right, this is for you.

10
00:01:39,080 --> 00:01:39,950
What is this?

11
00:01:40,580 --> 00:01:41,750
Doctor Luo gave it to you.

12
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,500
He said he wrote down a remedy for your headaches.

13
00:01:44,620 --> 00:01:46,080
He wants you to study it carefully.

14
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:48,870
He went back to research an antidote.

15
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:04,000
He’ll stay by the young madam’s side to serve her in the future.

16
00:02:11,950 --> 00:02:13,950
No wonder they’re the one I had my eye on.

17
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:16,120
They’re a perfect match.

18
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:19,830
Young Lord, the Second Young Master requests an audience.

19
00:02:20,580 --> 00:02:21,660
He dares to come?

20
00:02:23,620 --> 00:02:24,540
Let him in.

21
00:02:33,370 --> 00:02:34,750
Looks like I came at just the right time.

22
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:48,160
It smells delicious.

23
00:02:49,660 --> 00:02:51,540
This is for people to eat.

24
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,290
Beasts don’t deserve it.

25
00:02:53,620 --> 00:02:55,580
How dare you call our Second Young Master a beast!

26
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:57,160
Did I?

27
00:02:57,540 --> 00:02:59,040
You admitted it so quickly.

28
00:02:59,040 --> 00:02:59,620
You—

29
00:02:59,620 --> 00:03:00,330
Zhulan.

30
00:03:06,910 --> 00:03:07,700
I know.

31
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:09,660
You're angry that I left at the last minute.

32
00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:12,040
But Minghua suddenly fell ill.

33
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:13,580
The doctor in Liucheng couldn't help her.

34
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,870
So I had no choice but to take her back first.

35
00:03:16,830 --> 00:03:19,660
Who could have known something like that would happen at the mass grave?

36
00:03:20,660 --> 00:03:22,250
The magistrate of Liucheng is really bold.

37
00:03:22,250 --> 00:03:23,830
He actually dared to ignore the young lord's safety.

38
00:03:23,830 --> 00:03:24,910
And ordered the fire to be set.

39
00:03:26,410 --> 00:03:27,450
With just a few words,

40
00:03:27,790 --> 00:03:29,700
he managed to clear himself of all responsibility.

41
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,910
Everything I said is true.

42
00:03:33,450 --> 00:03:34,160
No matter what,

43
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:35,790
I could never harm Third Brother.

44
00:03:35,830 --> 00:03:37,160
Let me ask you one thing.

45
00:03:39,870 --> 00:03:41,370
The fire at the mass grave—

46
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,330
did you really know nothing about it?

47
00:03:46,410 --> 00:03:47,750
I can swear to the heavens.

48
00:03:48,620 --> 00:03:50,080
Even putting aside the commoners,

49
00:03:50,410 --> 00:03:51,700
you were still there at the time.

50
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:53,660
I absolutely could not have done it.

51
00:04:00,660 --> 00:04:01,830
I'll believe you this time.

52
00:04:04,950 --> 00:04:05,750
Third Brother,

53
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:07,450
it's good that you're all right this time.

54
00:04:07,790 --> 00:04:09,500
Otherwise, I really wouldn't be able to clear my name.

55
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,500
Hurry up and take your dog with you.

56
00:04:11,950 --> 00:04:13,330
It's ruining our appetite.

57
00:04:15,330 --> 00:04:16,870
Then I won't disturb you any longer.

58
00:04:16,870 --> 00:04:18,750
I'll let Third Brother and the two madams enjoy your meal.

59
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:19,910
Farewell.

60
00:04:26,450 --> 00:04:28,290
Zhu Lan is his trusted confidant.

61
00:04:28,290 --> 00:04:29,790
How could he not know about this?

62
00:04:30,290 --> 00:04:32,580
He would never do something like murder or arson.

63
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
There are still many things

64
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,370
that we don't know about.

65
00:04:37,580 --> 00:04:38,370
Eat.

66
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:43,790
Useless.

67
00:04:44,250 --> 00:04:45,330
I've sent everyone away.

68
00:04:45,330 --> 00:04:46,500
We had the perfect timing, location, and people.

69
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:48,450
And you still failed under these circumstances.

70
00:04:48,620 --> 00:04:49,580
What use are you to me?

71
00:04:49,580 --> 00:04:50,580
I didn't expect it either.

72
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:54,000
Xiao Jingyang and Lin Mingxuan are really lucky to have survived.

73
00:04:54,330 --> 00:04:55,660
They even called Doctor Luo.

74
00:04:56,660 --> 00:04:59,160
Now the Second Young Master is under suspicion.

75
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:01,040
And I've lost support in the court.

76
00:05:01,410 --> 00:05:04,080
Xiao Jingyang has taken all the spotlight.

77
00:05:04,370 --> 00:05:06,000
Although the plan failed this time,

78
00:05:07,830 --> 00:05:09,080
I discovered a secret.

79
00:05:09,080 --> 00:05:10,750
Xiao Jingyang, you're hurt.

80
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:12,000
What?

81
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:16,660
You said Xiao Jingyang called Lin Mingxuan "Xiao Jingyang"?

82
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:17,910
That's right.

83
00:05:18,660 --> 00:05:21,790
The behavior of these two is especially strange.

84
00:05:22,370 --> 00:05:23,750
It's as if they've become different people.

85
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:25,000
Go investigate.

86
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,120
You must get to the bottom of this.

87
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:27,000
Yes.

88
00:05:30,330 --> 00:05:31,120
Wait.

89
00:05:38,660 --> 00:05:39,660
Thank you, Second Miss.

90
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:41,200
Don't let the Second Young Master know

91
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:42,330
that you're working for me.

92
00:05:42,540 --> 00:05:43,370
Zhu Lan understands.

93
00:05:49,450 --> 00:05:50,450
Greetings, Young Lord.

94
00:05:51,290 --> 00:05:52,450
Teacher, please rise.

95
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,580
Young Lord, have you truly returned to your original self?

96
00:05:56,750 --> 00:05:58,120
It's just as you said, Teacher.

97
00:05:58,910 --> 00:05:59,700
That day...

98
00:06:05,370 --> 00:06:06,330
So, in that case,

99
00:06:06,750 --> 00:06:08,330
you used Miss Lin's body

100
00:06:08,580 --> 00:06:10,450
to shield Young Lord's body from this calamity.

101
00:06:11,660 --> 00:06:13,370
That perfectly fulfilled the destined tribulation.

102
00:06:13,660 --> 00:06:14,870
You mean to say,

103
00:06:15,790 --> 00:06:16,870
a life for a life?

104
00:06:17,620 --> 00:06:19,080
Even if their bodies were switched,

105
00:06:19,660 --> 00:06:21,040
as long as it was Lin Mingxuan's body

106
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:22,870
that died to save Xiao Jingyang's body,

107
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:24,040
it still counts as fulfilling the tribulation.

108
00:06:25,330 --> 00:06:26,160
That's right.

109
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:29,370
In every past life,

110
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:32,080
Miss Lin died to save the Young Lord.

111
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:34,040
In this life,

112
00:06:35,250 --> 00:06:38,450
you were willing to give up your own lifespan to save her.

113
00:06:39,290 --> 00:06:40,950
Even though your bodies were accidentally switched,

114
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:43,950
it still fulfilled the destined tribulation.

115
00:06:46,660 --> 00:06:47,540
Then, in this life, will Mingxuan

116
00:06:47,540 --> 00:06:49,660
be able to live peacefully and safely?

117
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:51,660
If you want her to have a peaceful life,

118
00:06:52,450 --> 00:06:53,580
the best way

119
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:55,790
is to divorce her as soon as possible

120
00:06:56,290 --> 00:06:57,330
and keep your distance.

121
00:06:58,200 --> 00:06:59,000
Divorce...

122
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,450
Is it truly unavoidable in the end?

123
00:07:22,290 --> 00:07:23,700
I heard the High Priest has arrived.

124
00:07:23,830 --> 00:07:25,500
I made some snacks for you to try.

125
00:07:29,830 --> 00:07:30,620
Where is everyone?

126
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:33,120
Why did they leave?

127
00:07:35,870 --> 00:07:37,160
Since I've already made them,

128
00:07:37,620 --> 00:07:38,950
I can't just let them go to waste.

129
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:42,870
How about you try some?

130
00:07:42,870 --> 00:07:44,330
I don't like sweets.

131
00:07:45,700 --> 00:07:46,500
What's wrong?

132
00:07:47,290 --> 00:07:48,450
Are you in a bad mood?

133
00:07:48,450 --> 00:07:49,160
No.

134
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:53,000
Did Lord Liu scold you?

135
00:07:53,660 --> 00:07:55,160
Or did you two have a disagreement?

136
00:07:55,870 --> 00:07:56,660
Lin Mingxuan

137
00:07:58,660 --> 00:08:00,160
You and I have already switched back our bodies.

138
00:08:00,290 --> 00:08:02,160
You shouldn't meddle in court affairs anymore.

139
00:08:02,660 --> 00:08:03,870
I'm just worried about you.

140
00:08:03,870 --> 00:08:04,660
That's not necessary.

141
00:08:06,620 --> 00:08:07,410
You—

142
00:08:07,830 --> 00:08:09,290
You don't appreciate good intentions.

143
00:08:10,410 --> 00:08:11,200
Wait.

144
00:08:16,330 --> 00:08:17,700
Don't come here without permission from now on.

145
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,160
Who would even want to come here?

146
00:08:22,620 --> 00:08:24,330
Even if you beg me in the future, I won't come.

147
00:08:56,330 --> 00:08:57,120
Sorry

148
00:09:02,660 --> 00:09:04,370
That damn Xiao Jingyang

149
00:09:04,750 --> 00:09:06,000
I won't care about you anymore

150
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:09,040
Isn't this story exciting?

151
00:09:09,790 --> 00:09:10,580
Take a look

152
00:09:10,620 --> 00:09:11,700
Well done

153
00:09:12,370 --> 00:09:13,580
I'll talk to you again

154
00:09:13,750 --> 00:09:14,910
I'm such a fool

155
00:09:15,330 --> 00:09:17,830
I'm so angry

156
00:09:17,870 --> 00:09:19,370
Lin Mingxuan, what's wrong?

157
00:09:19,410 --> 00:09:20,580
Who made you angry?

158
00:09:21,410 --> 00:09:22,660
Who else could it be?

159
00:09:23,500 --> 00:09:24,330
Who?

160
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:26,000
Shao Jun

161
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:29,000
No

162
00:09:29,250 --> 00:09:30,000
Usually, Shao Jun

163
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,540
can't get enough of sticking to Mingxuan

164
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:33,790
How could he bear to make her angry?

165
00:09:33,950 --> 00:09:34,830
Don't you think

166
00:09:34,830 --> 00:09:36,580
since Shao Jun came back from Liucheng

167
00:09:36,620 --> 00:09:37,830
he's changed a lot?

168
00:09:40,040 --> 00:09:43,040
Now that you mention it, that's true

169
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:48,450
He's almost as bad as the old Mingxuan

170
00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:49,330
Stop, stop, stop

171
00:09:49,830 --> 00:09:51,370
Are you here to comfort me

172
00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:52,870
or to provoke me

173
00:09:53,660 --> 00:09:55,080
Don't be upset

174
00:09:55,290 --> 00:09:57,330
Of course I'm on my best friend's side

175
00:09:59,830 --> 00:10:00,700
Tell me

176
00:10:01,660 --> 00:10:03,700
Does Xiao Jingyang dislike me

177
00:10:03,790 --> 00:10:04,580
Girl

178
00:10:04,620 --> 00:10:06,160
Can you be a bit more confident

179
00:10:06,370 --> 00:10:07,580
Who does the Young Lord ever dislike

180
00:10:07,580 --> 00:10:08,910
He definitely doesn't dislike you

181
00:10:09,370 --> 00:10:12,250
Then why is he so hot and cold with me

182
00:10:13,950 --> 00:10:14,750
Well

183
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:18,790
You, you explain

184
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,290
How would I know

185
00:10:25,830 --> 00:10:26,660
I know

186
00:10:26,750 --> 00:10:27,660
The Young Lord secretly kept

187
00:10:27,660 --> 00:10:29,120
so many portraits of the Young Lady

188
00:10:29,410 --> 00:10:30,410
If he disliked someone

189
00:10:30,410 --> 00:10:32,120
why would he keep so many portraits

190
00:10:32,410 --> 00:10:34,580
and even treasure them like precious things

191
00:10:34,660 --> 00:10:35,450
Exactly, exactly

192
00:10:35,580 --> 00:10:37,450
He must really like you

193
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:39,000
Portraits

194
00:10:39,950 --> 00:10:41,750
How come I've never seen them
