1
00:01:14,950 --> 00:01:15,790
You're awake.

2
00:01:16,450 --> 00:01:18,370
How are you? Does your head still hurt?

3
00:01:18,540 --> 00:01:19,870
Is there anywhere else you feel unwell?

4
00:01:19,910 --> 00:01:20,700
I'm fine.

5
00:01:22,830 --> 00:01:23,910
You shouldn't be here.

6
00:01:24,790 --> 00:01:26,580
Since you think I shouldn't be here,

7
00:01:26,750 --> 00:01:28,120
then you shouldn't have saved me yesterday.

8
00:01:28,120 --> 00:01:28,950
I told you,

9
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:32,120
if it were someone else,

10
00:01:32,120 --> 00:01:33,410
Yes, you said that.

11
00:01:33,410 --> 00:01:35,540
You would save anyone else too.

12
00:01:36,330 --> 00:01:37,290
Xiao Jingyang.

13
00:01:37,700 --> 00:01:39,910
Your mouth is even tougher than your bones.

14
00:01:41,580 --> 00:01:42,580
Think whatever you want.

15
00:01:44,080 --> 00:01:45,540
Anyway, you shouldn't stay here.

16
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:47,040
That won't do.

17
00:01:47,540 --> 00:01:49,000
Since you saved my life,

18
00:01:49,160 --> 00:01:50,370
I have to repay you.

19
00:01:51,910 --> 00:01:52,700
How about

20
00:01:54,620 --> 00:01:55,620
offering myself to you?

21
00:02:14,370 --> 00:02:15,910
Lin Mingxuan, aren't you embarrassed?

22
00:02:16,540 --> 00:02:18,620
It's not like it's your first marriage.

23
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:20,700
What, are you shy?

24
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:27,870
Wu Liuqi.

25
00:02:31,330 --> 00:02:32,120
Young Lord.

26
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:33,870
Get all unrelated people out of here.

27
00:02:33,910 --> 00:02:34,700
Young Lord.

28
00:02:35,330 --> 00:02:36,120
Hurry up.

29
00:02:39,660 --> 00:02:40,910
Sorry, Young Madam.

30
00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:42,830
Xiao Jingyang.

31
00:02:51,700 --> 00:02:52,580
Xiao Jingyang.

32
00:02:52,830 --> 00:02:54,580
Think about my earlier proposal.

33
00:02:58,040 --> 00:02:59,660
What's going on between you and the Young Lord?

34
00:02:59,910 --> 00:03:00,870
You still haven't made up?

35
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:03,700
Trying to win Xiao Jingyang's heart

36
00:03:03,700 --> 00:03:04,870
is really hard.

37
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:05,950
Let me tell you,

38
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:07,200
the storybooks say

39
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:09,330
when a woman pursues a man, it's like a thin veil between them.

40
00:03:09,580 --> 00:03:10,950
Just keep sticking to him.

41
00:03:25,790 --> 00:03:27,040
Escort the young madam back.

42
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:29,700
The people sent to protect her in secret

43
00:03:29,700 --> 00:03:30,620
must not be discovered.

44
00:03:30,620 --> 00:03:31,910
If you are worried about her, Young Lord,

45
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:33,500
why not go see for yourself?

46
00:03:34,830 --> 00:03:35,620
Teacher.

47
00:03:37,660 --> 00:03:38,580
Why are you here?

48
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,910
Some people get so lost in memories when they see familiar things

49
00:03:41,620 --> 00:03:43,450
that they don't even notice who has arrived.

50
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:48,950
I went back and looked through the priest's records.

51
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:51,700
Your poison attacks have become more frequent lately.

52
00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:52,950
I'm afraid

53
00:03:54,290 --> 00:03:55,040
even if Doctor Luo

54
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:56,500
really manages to develop an antidote,

55
00:03:57,250 --> 00:03:58,410
it may still be of no use.

56
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:01,750
Don't let yourself be weighed down by worries in the future.

57
00:04:02,660 --> 00:04:03,580
If possible,

58
00:04:04,250 --> 00:04:05,750
I'd rather live a carefree life.

59
00:04:06,910 --> 00:04:08,160
With nothing on my mind.

60
00:04:08,620 --> 00:04:10,830
If there are things you truly can't let go of,

61
00:04:11,870 --> 00:04:13,080
there's no need to force yourself.

62
00:04:16,330 --> 00:04:17,290
I've already told the young madam

63
00:04:18,870 --> 00:04:20,330
about your situation.

64
00:04:32,830 --> 00:04:33,910
How did she react?

65
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,200
What you fear in your heart—

66
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:37,620
do you really think she fears it too?

67
00:04:40,910 --> 00:04:42,410
Why not ask her yourself?

68
00:04:42,790 --> 00:04:43,580
Xiao Jingyang.

69
00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:46,540
I made this tonic soup for you.

70
00:04:46,540 --> 00:04:47,580
It can help relieve your headache.

71
00:04:49,700 --> 00:04:50,500
Lord Liu.

72
00:04:54,700 --> 00:04:56,250
Since the Young Lord is fine now,

73
00:04:56,580 --> 00:04:58,700
I'll take my leave.

74
00:05:03,790 --> 00:05:04,750
Drink it while it's hot.

75
00:05:04,950 --> 00:05:05,910
It nourishes the mind and boosts your energy.

76
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:08,830
You'll feel refreshed and clear-headed after drinking it.

77
00:05:11,750 --> 00:05:12,580
You should go back.

78
00:05:14,830 --> 00:05:16,120
If you want something else to drink,

79
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:17,250
I'll make it for you again.

80
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:21,370
Do you know why that person kidnapped you yesterday?

81
00:05:22,660 --> 00:05:23,580
To use me.

82
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:26,000
To make you fall out with Xiao Jingyu.

83
00:05:26,750 --> 00:05:28,500
And to make the old city lord suspicious of you.

84
00:05:29,750 --> 00:05:32,000
The person behind this is very clever.

85
00:05:33,330 --> 00:05:34,160
This is what

86
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:35,790
comes with my current position.

87
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:37,410
Yesterday was just the first time.

88
00:05:38,290 --> 00:05:40,160
If you keep getting involved with me,

89
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:41,620
there will be countless times like this in the future.

90
00:05:41,870 --> 00:05:43,000
Aren't you afraid?

91
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,540
I've already faced life and death at the Lin residence.

92
00:05:45,870 --> 00:05:47,500
Don't think I'm too fragile.

93
00:05:49,830 --> 00:05:51,040
You're really silly.

94
00:05:51,700 --> 00:05:52,660
I'm not silly.

95
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:54,660
You just underestimate me.

96
00:05:55,330 --> 00:05:57,450
I don't need you to sacrifice yourself to protect me.

97
00:05:58,700 --> 00:06:00,750
I just hope I can stand by your side.

98
00:06:01,410 --> 00:06:03,370
And fight against fate with you.

99
00:06:10,250 --> 00:06:12,160
This isn't as simple as you think.

100
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:13,910
I know.

101
00:06:14,620 --> 00:06:15,910
You want to change the ending.

102
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:17,790
But every time you see

103
00:06:17,790 --> 00:06:20,080
the person you want to protect die in front of you,

104
00:06:22,950 --> 00:06:23,870
you get scared.

105
00:06:25,830 --> 00:06:27,450
You try desperately to push me away.

106
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:29,450
But if this is

107
00:06:29,450 --> 00:06:30,950
a fate we can't change,

108
00:06:31,660 --> 00:06:33,200
at least we're still together now.

109
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:34,040
Aren't we?

110
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:45,830
You

111
00:06:49,410 --> 00:06:50,660
Are you really not afraid of death?

112
00:06:53,330 --> 00:06:54,370
I am afraid of death.

113
00:06:56,950 --> 00:06:58,870
But I'm even more afraid of living alone.

114
00:07:01,580 --> 00:07:02,450
Xiao Jingyang

115
00:07:03,290 --> 00:07:04,500
All I want

116
00:07:04,750 --> 00:07:06,160
is just to be able, like now,

117
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:07,330
to stand by your side.

118
00:07:11,330 --> 00:07:13,410
Lin Mingxuan, you really are a fool.

119
00:07:15,370 --> 00:07:16,160
Alright.

120
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:19,080
Hurry up and drink.

121
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:21,410
I spent several hours cooking this.

122
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:24,200
I'm going out for a walk.

123
00:07:25,450 --> 00:07:27,410
Hey, are you really not going to drink?

124
00:07:35,580 --> 00:07:37,620
I've already poured my heart out to you.

125
00:07:37,950 --> 00:07:39,620
And I still can't move you.

126
00:07:48,910 --> 00:07:50,120
Why is it so salty?

127
00:08:01,540 --> 00:08:02,370
Young Lord

128
00:08:04,660 --> 00:08:05,700
What are you all doing?

129
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:08,250
Just now, the Young Madam said she wanted hotpot.

130
00:08:08,250 --> 00:08:09,540
So we started preparing it.

131
00:08:09,580 --> 00:08:11,200
Consider it a welcome for her.

132
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:12,000
To celebrate her

133
00:08:13,410 --> 00:08:14,250
returning home.

134
00:08:19,870 --> 00:08:21,120
I'm a bit hungry.

135
00:08:21,830 --> 00:08:22,750
Let's eat together.

136
00:08:23,950 --> 00:08:24,750
Sure.

137
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:26,790
The more, the merrier.

138
00:08:26,950 --> 00:08:27,750
Xiao Hongtao

139
00:08:27,830 --> 00:08:29,330
Go quickly and call the Young Madam over.

140
00:08:29,750 --> 00:08:30,750
I'll go right away.

141
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:47,040
Mingxuan

142
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:48,540
Hurry up, we've been waiting for you.

143
00:09:48,830 --> 00:09:49,620
Mingxuan

144
00:09:49,660 --> 00:09:51,290
Hey, the hotpot is ready.

145
00:09:51,330 --> 00:09:52,950
Come on, come on, we've just been waiting for you.

146
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:56,250
Yeah, I'm starving.

147
00:09:58,040 --> 00:09:59,080
Come on, come on, come on!

148
00:10:03,330 --> 00:10:04,250
Quick, sit here.

149
00:10:05,370 --> 00:10:06,200
Come on, come on.

150
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:07,540
Come on, cheers!

151
00:10:07,700 --> 00:10:09,000
Here, cheers!

152
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:09,200
Okay.

153
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:09,950
Cheers!

154
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,040
This is so delicious.

155
00:10:13,870 --> 00:10:14,660
It's tasty.

156
00:10:15,660 --> 00:10:16,700
Mingxuan, try this.

157
00:10:16,700 --> 00:10:17,370
Here.

158
00:10:18,290 --> 00:10:19,870
Yes, just like that.

159
00:10:19,870 --> 00:10:21,000
It's not cooked yet.

160
00:10:21,540 --> 00:10:22,580
Don't rush.

161
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:24,660
Mingxuan

162
00:10:24,660 --> 00:10:25,790
I want to eat this too.

163
00:10:25,790 --> 00:10:26,750
It smells so good.

164
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:29,120
This one is tasty too.

165
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:29,870
Dip some more.

166
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:31,750
Even though this is still pretty spicy,

167
00:10:31,750 --> 00:10:33,200
it's really delicious.

168
00:10:33,450 --> 00:10:34,200
Yeah.
