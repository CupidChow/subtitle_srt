1
00:01:21,410 --> 00:01:23,250
Hey, Xiao Jingyang.

2
00:01:28,910 --> 00:01:30,290
You didn't get beaten to death, did you?

3
00:01:38,790 --> 00:01:40,750
After all, I died trying to save you.

4
00:01:40,950 --> 00:01:42,200
And yet you want to kill me.

5
00:01:42,330 --> 00:01:43,910
Ungrateful jerk.

6
00:01:46,910 --> 00:01:47,700
No, that's not right.

7
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:50,540
This is my body now.

8
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:54,120
I'll save you again.

9
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:10,080
What are you doing?

10
00:02:12,910 --> 00:02:13,830
I'm applying medicine for you.

11
00:02:14,370 --> 00:02:15,870
Otherwise, do you want to bleed to death?

12
00:02:15,870 --> 00:02:16,660
I'll do it myself.

13
00:02:16,660 --> 00:02:17,410
Don't you dare.

14
00:02:18,540 --> 00:02:20,950
You—you're not allowed to look at my body.

15
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:24,580
Don't make that kind of face with my face.

16
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:27,540
You think I want to?

17
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:29,290
I tried to save you out of kindness.

18
00:02:29,290 --> 00:02:30,910
And now look at what happened.

19
00:02:31,450 --> 00:02:32,790
And you still want to kill me.

20
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:34,540
Our bodies have been swapped.

21
00:02:34,660 --> 00:02:35,660
This is no coincidence.

22
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:38,290
Today, I want to try something.

23
00:02:39,250 --> 00:02:40,580
See if we can switch back.

24
00:02:41,250 --> 00:02:42,540
You mean—

25
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:44,950
Die again?

26
00:02:46,700 --> 00:02:47,500
No way.

27
00:02:48,660 --> 00:02:50,000
I don't want to be a target for arrows.

28
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,080
What if we don't switch back?

29
00:02:51,290 --> 00:02:52,370
We could lose our lives.

30
00:02:52,660 --> 00:02:53,660
But you're in my body.

31
00:02:53,660 --> 00:02:54,910
That could be dangerous.

32
00:02:59,410 --> 00:03:00,250
Are you afraid I'll stop you

33
00:03:00,250 --> 00:03:01,580
from marrying General Wang's daughter?

34
00:03:01,700 --> 00:03:02,370
That's not it.

35
00:03:02,370 --> 00:03:03,080
Don't worry.

36
00:03:08,700 --> 00:03:09,540
In this lifetime,

37
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:12,370
I will never marry you.

38
00:03:13,450 --> 00:03:14,290
Ming Xuan.

39
00:03:14,750 --> 00:03:15,910
Let's go back to the Young Lord's residence first.

40
00:03:16,290 --> 00:03:17,330
We'll talk about the rest later.

41
00:03:38,660 --> 00:03:39,790
Alright, everyone can leave now.

42
00:03:40,410 --> 00:03:41,250
Yes.

43
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:45,450
Where are you going?

44
00:03:47,790 --> 00:03:50,290
I don't have a habit of watching people bathe.

45
00:03:51,410 --> 00:03:52,580
What nonsense are you talking about?

46
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:54,540
My body has wounds.

47
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:55,910
I need to soak in a medicinal bath.

48
00:03:55,950 --> 00:03:56,910
Otherwise, there will be scars.

49
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:58,200
So what?

50
00:03:58,410 --> 00:03:59,660
This is my body.

51
00:03:59,830 --> 00:04:01,500
Have you thought about the consequences of a woman having scars?

52
00:04:03,410 --> 00:04:05,290
If you want me to take a medicinal bath, that's fine.

53
00:04:06,540 --> 00:04:07,330
But—

54
00:04:08,330 --> 00:04:09,160
You—

55
00:04:10,450 --> 00:04:11,290
Get out.

56
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,540
This is my body.

57
00:04:14,540 --> 00:04:15,870
There's nothing I haven't seen.

58
00:04:19,330 --> 00:04:20,120
I certainly haven't—

59
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:21,870
—any interest in being watched while bathing.

60
00:04:30,700 --> 00:04:31,500
Hey!

61
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:33,160
You can soak,

62
00:04:33,580 --> 00:04:34,790
but don't touch anything you shouldn't.

63
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:37,290
There's nothing special.

64
00:04:37,660 --> 00:04:39,000
What's there to touch anyway?

65
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:39,620
You—

66
00:04:42,910 --> 00:04:43,750
True.

67
00:04:44,700 --> 00:04:46,910
I've been married to the Young Lord for three months.

68
00:04:47,330 --> 00:04:48,500
We haven't consummated the marriage.

69
00:04:48,910 --> 00:04:50,370
I suppose the Young Lord

70
00:04:51,250 --> 00:04:52,830
doesn't have that ability.

71
00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:55,830
So during those three months,

72
00:04:56,120 --> 00:04:57,790
you were really looking forward to consummating with me.

73
00:04:57,790 --> 00:04:58,620
Nonsense!

74
00:04:58,790 --> 00:04:59,620
I wasn't!

75
00:05:01,540 --> 00:05:02,700
Could you, Young Lord,

76
00:05:02,910 --> 00:05:04,330
bring me my clothes?

77
00:05:09,330 --> 00:05:10,450
That won't do.

78
00:05:12,620 --> 00:05:13,620
This medicinal bath

79
00:05:13,910 --> 00:05:16,200
was specially prepared for you by me.

80
00:05:16,450 --> 00:05:17,250
You,

81
00:05:17,660 --> 00:05:19,620
just stay here obediently for me

82
00:05:19,750 --> 00:05:21,160
and soak properly.

83
00:05:24,580 --> 00:05:26,500
Since you care about me so much,

84
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:28,700
why don't we soak together?

85
00:05:33,700 --> 00:05:34,500
You—

86
00:05:36,620 --> 00:05:37,500
There's someone outside the window.

87
00:05:40,830 --> 00:05:41,620
Pretend to faint.

88
00:05:46,450 --> 00:05:47,950
Young Lord, Young Lord!

89
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:49,200
Young Lord, what's wrong?

90
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:50,410
Young Lord, wake up!

91
00:05:58,330 --> 00:05:59,160
Princess.

92
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:00,870
What's wrong?

93
00:06:02,910 --> 00:06:03,910
Were we discovered?

94
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:05,290
No.

95
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:15,540
Then why are you embarrassed?

96
00:06:17,290 --> 00:06:18,290
I saw

97
00:06:19,700 --> 00:06:22,040
the Young Lord and the eldest Miss of the Lin family

98
00:06:22,540 --> 00:06:23,700
taking a bath together.

99
00:06:24,410 --> 00:06:26,580
The Young Lord couldn't hold on

100
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:28,000
and fainted.

101
00:06:32,370 --> 00:06:33,540
My younger brother

102
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,160
never makes a sound,

103
00:06:35,750 --> 00:06:37,250
but when he does, it's astonishing.

104
00:06:37,290 --> 00:06:38,370
I also saw

105
00:06:38,870 --> 00:06:40,790
the second young master go to the Young Lord's room.

106
00:06:44,370 --> 00:06:45,160
Jingyu.

107
00:06:47,540 --> 00:06:49,000
What is he doing there?

108
00:06:54,700 --> 00:06:57,620
The marriage between Jingyang and the Lin family must happen.

109
00:06:59,000 --> 00:06:59,830
No.

110
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:02,330
Go do something for me.

111
00:07:09,870 --> 00:07:11,250
Remember, don't let your wound get wet.

112
00:07:14,790 --> 00:07:15,580
All done.

113
00:07:30,290 --> 00:07:31,250
What is this?

114
00:07:31,790 --> 00:07:32,580
A marriage contract.

115
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:36,160
What happened today

116
00:07:36,450 --> 00:07:37,870
will definitely not happen just once.

117
00:07:39,290 --> 00:07:40,080
Mingxuan,

118
00:07:40,580 --> 00:07:42,700
I know you don't want to marry me again in this life.

119
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:43,830
But right now,

120
00:07:43,830 --> 00:07:45,370
we can't get away from each other.

121
00:07:46,250 --> 00:07:47,540
To get through this crisis,

122
00:07:48,250 --> 00:07:49,870
we have to stay together at all times.

123
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:00,000
As expected,

124
00:08:00,700 --> 00:08:02,000
it's another divorce agreement.

125
00:08:02,540 --> 00:08:03,620
This is already

126
00:08:03,620 --> 00:08:05,040
the second divorce agreement I've received.

127
00:08:06,910 --> 00:08:07,700
Sorry.

128
00:08:09,450 --> 00:08:10,250
I agree.

129
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:18,250
After all, I want to get my body back even more than you do.

130
00:08:20,870 --> 00:08:21,910
You're injured.

131
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:23,250
Stay here tonight.

132
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:26,040
I'll go to the study.

133
00:09:09,790 --> 00:09:10,580
Mingxuan

134
00:09:11,910 --> 00:09:13,540
As long as you can live well,

135
00:09:14,660 --> 00:09:16,450
I don't care about anything else.

136
00:09:42,950 --> 00:09:43,870
Why are you here?

137
00:09:45,580 --> 00:09:47,040
The old city lord has summoned you.

138
00:09:48,580 --> 00:09:49,370
Wait.

139
00:09:49,830 --> 00:09:51,870
The old city lord, your father,

140
00:09:55,330 --> 00:09:56,660
I can't go with you.

141
00:09:57,620 --> 00:09:58,870
I'll have Wu Liuqi accompany you.

142
00:09:59,750 --> 00:10:00,830
If you can't handle it,

143
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:02,330
just pretend to faint.

144
00:10:02,700 --> 00:10:03,540
That's not necessary.

145
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:05,660
It's not like I haven't met the old city lord before.

146
00:10:07,450 --> 00:10:08,450
Be careful with everything.

147
00:10:17,660 --> 00:10:18,450
Elder sister.

148
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:19,950
Elder brother.

149
00:10:23,330 --> 00:10:24,120
Where is father?

150
00:10:24,830 --> 00:10:26,160
Wasn't father the one who wanted to see me?

151
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:28,160
Father heard you were attacked while traveling.

152
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:29,160
He got anxious.

153
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:30,080
He felt unwell.

154
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:31,410
He's already gone back to rest.

155
00:10:32,830 --> 00:10:33,910
Quick, tell your sister,

156
00:10:33,950 --> 00:10:35,250
where did you get hurt?

157
00:10:35,540 --> 00:10:36,540
The injuries aren't too bad.

158
00:10:36,790 --> 00:10:38,700
It's just that those assassins were pretty skilled.

159
00:10:38,950 --> 00:10:40,120
Even Wu Liuqi couldn't catch up with them.

160
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:46,080
Is father’s health alright?

161
00:10:46,620 --> 00:10:48,540
Should I go check on him?

162
00:10:48,790 --> 00:10:50,540
You should wait until father feels better

163
00:10:50,540 --> 00:10:51,660
before you go visit him.

164
00:10:52,330 --> 00:10:55,000
But father asked me to remind you of something.

165
00:10:55,540 --> 00:10:56,330
What is it?

166
00:10:58,450 --> 00:11:01,040
Previously, because of the Lin family's wedding,

167
00:11:01,290 --> 00:11:02,250
you wanted to call off the engagement.

168
00:11:02,250 --> 00:11:03,620
You knelt outside the hall all night.

169
00:11:04,290 --> 00:11:05,500
As a result, you fell ill.

170
00:11:05,500 --> 00:11:06,500
It harmed your health deeply.

171
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,410
Father deeply regrets this.

172
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,830
Although you are the young city lord,

173
00:11:10,830 --> 00:11:12,120
and have your responsibilities,

174
00:11:12,750 --> 00:11:14,000
when it comes to marriage,

175
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:14,950
if you are unwilling,

176
00:11:14,950 --> 00:11:16,040
you don't have to force yourself.

177
00:11:16,450 --> 00:11:17,870
Father asked me to tell you

178
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,660
that your engagement to Miss Lin

179
00:11:19,830 --> 00:11:20,790
will be canceled as you wish.

180
00:11:20,910 --> 00:11:21,700
Let it go.

181
00:11:21,790 --> 00:11:22,580
No.

182
00:11:22,700 --> 00:11:24,120
Before, you were completely unwilling.

183
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:25,790
Now that Father has agreed,

184
00:11:25,790 --> 00:11:27,080
why do you refuse again?

185
00:11:27,080 --> 00:11:28,080
Everyone knows

186
00:11:28,580 --> 00:11:30,370
that I brought Lin Mingxuan to stay at the residence

187
00:11:30,370 --> 00:11:32,080
as my fiancée.

188
00:11:32,450 --> 00:11:33,370
If I break off the engagement now,

189
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,120
what will happen to her reputation?

190
00:11:36,250 --> 00:11:37,040
Third Brother

191
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:39,500
Lin Mingxuan is not worthy of you at all.

192
00:11:39,620 --> 00:11:41,290
Weren't you also completely unwilling before?

193
00:11:41,290 --> 00:11:43,540
Why not just go along with Father's wishes?

194
00:11:43,790 --> 00:11:45,410
Well, Xiao Jingyu, you...

195
00:11:45,620 --> 00:11:46,870
You talked nonsense in the previous life.

196
00:11:46,870 --> 00:11:47,830
You made Xiao Jingyang mistakenly believe

197
00:11:47,830 --> 00:11:49,080
that there was something between you and me.

198
00:11:49,290 --> 00:11:50,910
And now in this life, you insult me again.

199
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:53,040
This time, I absolutely won't tolerate it.

200
00:11:53,870 --> 00:11:55,120
But Father also said

201
00:11:56,040 --> 00:11:57,500
marrying Lin Mingxuan was to

202
00:11:57,500 --> 00:11:59,290
bring our family closer to the Lin family.

203
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:01,750
Since Lin Mingxuan isn't worthy of me,

204
00:12:02,040 --> 00:12:03,450
why not let me marry Lin Minghua instead?

205
00:12:03,790 --> 00:12:05,370
I've heard that the second Miss of the Lin family

206
00:12:05,370 --> 00:12:06,500
is extremely talented.

207
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:08,290
She's skilled in music, chess, calligraphy, and painting.

208
00:12:08,790 --> 00:12:09,950
She should be worthy of me, right?

209
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:11,040
I want to see

210
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:12,750
how you handle it when your own relationship is disrupted.

211
00:12:12,750 --> 00:12:13,750
What will you do then?

212
00:12:15,160 --> 00:12:15,950
No!

213
00:12:17,950 --> 00:12:18,750
Elder Sister

214
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:21,290
The second daughter of the Lin family and I have long been in love.

215
00:12:21,290 --> 00:12:22,290
We've already pledged ourselves to each other.

216
00:12:22,290 --> 00:12:24,250
So he admits it himself.

217
00:12:24,450 --> 00:12:25,950
The kid is actually quite devoted.

218
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:26,790
Jingyang

219
00:12:27,410 --> 00:12:29,410
Since you want to take responsibility for the eldest Miss of the Lin family,

220
00:12:29,410 --> 00:12:30,830
that's certainly a good thing.

221
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:31,910
As for your earlier wish

222
00:12:31,910 --> 00:12:33,750
to marry General Wang's daughter,

223
00:12:33,750 --> 00:12:35,620
Father has already mentioned it to General Wang.

224
00:12:35,620 --> 00:12:37,000
You can just marry them both.

225
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,410
What do you mean, General Wang's daughter?

226
00:12:46,830 --> 00:12:47,620
How is it?

227
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,580
Did Father say anything today?

228
00:12:54,330 --> 00:12:55,370
The city lord is ill.

229
00:12:57,160 --> 00:12:58,290
I didn't see him.

230
00:12:58,910 --> 00:12:59,750
What?

231
00:13:00,700 --> 00:13:02,370
Are you really going to marry General Wang's daughter?

232
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:16,040
So you knelt in front of the main hall all night.

233
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:18,950
It wasn't just to break off the engagement.

234
00:13:20,830 --> 00:13:22,290
It was to marry Wang Yiqiang.

235
00:13:25,660 --> 00:13:26,450
So you weren't

236
00:13:26,450 --> 00:13:28,660
someone who fell in love with someone else after we got married.

237
00:13:31,950 --> 00:13:33,040
If that's the case,

238
00:13:35,950 --> 00:13:36,750
then in our previous life,

239
00:13:36,750 --> 00:13:39,120
why did you pretend to want to marry me?

240
00:13:41,830 --> 00:13:42,580
It's not what you think.

241
00:13:42,580 --> 00:13:43,540
Then what is it?

242
00:13:47,950 --> 00:13:48,750
Xiao Jingyang.

243
00:13:49,160 --> 00:13:51,160
As long as you explain, I'll believe you.

244
00:14:09,580 --> 00:14:11,540
If we're only pretending to be together,

245
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:16,370
then why should we keep this marriage contract between us?

246
00:15:00,410 --> 00:15:01,160
Mingxuan

247
00:15:02,830 --> 00:15:03,620
I'm sorry
