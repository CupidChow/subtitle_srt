1
00:01:16,750 --> 00:01:18,000
Why are you here?

2
00:01:18,830 --> 00:01:20,120
To laugh at me?

3
00:01:20,370 --> 00:01:22,410
How are you doing in this prison?

4
00:01:22,620 --> 00:01:24,330
I'm not interested at all.

5
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:26,500
Then why did you come?

6
00:01:26,620 --> 00:01:29,290
Who was the one who rescued Zhu Lan from the Lin family last time?

7
00:01:30,540 --> 00:01:31,540
He escaped.

8
00:01:32,620 --> 00:01:33,410
That's true.

9
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:36,450
If the people behind him helped him,

10
00:01:36,620 --> 00:01:38,000
with just a few of you,

11
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:39,580
there's no way you could catch him.

12
00:01:40,120 --> 00:01:40,910
That person

13
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:45,160
is the real mastermind behind Zhu Lan.

14
00:01:47,160 --> 00:01:48,620
Why should I tell you?

15
00:01:49,870 --> 00:01:51,200
Even at a time like this,

16
00:01:51,910 --> 00:01:53,290
you're still covering for them.

17
00:01:53,370 --> 00:01:54,200
No.

18
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:57,160
The more anxious you get,

19
00:01:57,250 --> 00:01:58,370
the more helpless you seem,

20
00:01:58,540 --> 00:01:59,620
the happier I am.

21
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:00,870
Lin Mingxuan.

22
00:02:01,540 --> 00:02:02,950
So what if you won?

23
00:02:04,660 --> 00:02:06,540
The only reason you're still alive today

24
00:02:06,540 --> 00:02:08,290
is because you stepped over Wang Yiqiang's corpse.

25
00:02:08,620 --> 00:02:09,540
Without her,

26
00:02:09,950 --> 00:02:10,950
you would be the one dead.

27
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,040
Shut up!

28
00:02:14,910 --> 00:02:16,540
You're not worthy to mention that name.

29
00:02:19,620 --> 00:02:21,040
You're already getting angry?

30
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,950
Wang Yiqiang is just foolish.

31
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:27,950
But after knowing you for just a few days,

32
00:02:27,950 --> 00:02:29,330
she was willing to die for you.

33
00:02:29,870 --> 00:02:30,660
And I,

34
00:02:31,910 --> 00:02:33,200
after all these years,

35
00:02:33,750 --> 00:02:35,700
trying to please and cling to Xiao Jingyu,

36
00:02:36,250 --> 00:02:37,040
but he,

37
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:39,370
for the sake of so-called brotherly bonds,

38
00:02:39,370 --> 00:02:40,790
wants me dead.

39
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:41,830
As expected,

40
00:02:42,870 --> 00:02:45,370
most men in this world are heartless.

41
00:02:46,790 --> 00:02:48,040
It's fine if you don't say anything.

42
00:02:48,790 --> 00:02:50,200
I will definitely find this person.

43
00:02:51,370 --> 00:02:53,620
And personally take revenge for Qiangqiang.

44
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:56,910
As for you,

45
00:02:59,540 --> 00:03:00,290
do you know why the young lord

46
00:03:00,290 --> 00:03:02,370
didn't execute you immediately?

47
00:03:03,870 --> 00:03:05,000
Your life

48
00:03:05,370 --> 00:03:07,290
was spared because Xiao Jingyu volunteered to be confined for ten years

49
00:03:07,290 --> 00:03:08,450
in exchange for it.

50
00:03:11,290 --> 00:03:12,790
You will be imprisoned here for ten years.

51
00:03:13,410 --> 00:03:15,450
He is also giving up his own ten years of freedom

52
00:03:15,660 --> 00:03:17,250
to save your life.

53
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:38,700
Xiao Jingyu, you're so foolish.

54
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:04,870
Minghua,

55
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:07,620
when we get married,

56
00:04:07,790 --> 00:04:10,250
I will give you the most beautiful view in the city.

57
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:22,000
Why are you here?

58
00:04:23,540 --> 00:04:24,540
I came to take you home.

59
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:27,000
It's windy at night.

60
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:31,910
You didn't even think to bring a coat.

61
00:04:50,790 --> 00:04:51,620
Xiao Jingyang,

62
00:04:54,830 --> 00:04:56,750
I used to really hate Lin Minghua.

63
00:04:58,160 --> 00:04:59,750
She took my father away from me.

64
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:04,040
Her mother caused my birth mother’s death.

65
00:05:06,450 --> 00:05:08,910
She framed me and made things difficult for me.

66
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:12,250
But seeing her like this now,

67
00:05:13,950 --> 00:05:15,830
I can't bring myself to hate her anymore.

68
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:27,000
Suddenly, I just feel sorry for her.

69
00:05:32,870 --> 00:05:35,790
She spent her whole life being compared to me.

70
00:05:36,700 --> 00:05:39,660
Even her feelings were treated as a wager.

71
00:05:40,620 --> 00:05:42,120
In the end, she lost everything.

72
00:05:47,620 --> 00:05:49,120
Lin Minghua doesn't deserve sympathy.

73
00:05:50,250 --> 00:05:52,040
But my elder brother is the one to pity.

74
00:05:53,580 --> 00:05:54,370
For her sake,

75
00:05:55,540 --> 00:05:58,000
he willingly shut himself away in the residence for ten whole years.

76
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,620
He still has ten years left to live.

77
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:09,000
But what about you?

78
00:06:30,750 --> 00:06:31,540
Young Lord,

79
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:33,910
your poisoning is getting worse and worse.

80
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:35,290
If this continues, I'm afraid...

81
00:06:35,290 --> 00:06:36,000
Enough.

82
00:06:36,750 --> 00:06:38,870
The young madam must not know about this.

83
00:06:39,750 --> 00:06:40,540
Let's go.

84
00:06:55,790 --> 00:06:56,620
What are you thinking about?

85
00:06:57,370 --> 00:06:58,250
You're so lost in thought.

86
00:07:01,450 --> 00:07:02,290
Xiao Jingyang.

87
00:07:03,330 --> 00:07:04,580
I'm tired today.

88
00:07:04,830 --> 00:07:06,120
Can you carry me home?

89
00:07:07,870 --> 00:07:08,660
Alright.

90
00:07:26,910 --> 00:07:27,750
Oh, by the way,

91
00:07:28,580 --> 00:07:31,120
will you go with me to visit Qiangqiang tomorrow?

92
00:07:31,700 --> 00:07:33,370
There's a new storybook out recently.

93
00:07:33,950 --> 00:07:35,160
She'll definitely like it.

94
00:07:35,790 --> 00:07:37,750
I want to show it to her as soon as possible.

95
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:39,910
Okay.

96
00:07:41,910 --> 00:07:42,700
Then...

97
00:07:44,700 --> 00:07:46,370
Will you marry me again?

98
00:07:48,290 --> 00:07:49,580
If you think about it,

99
00:07:49,660 --> 00:07:52,450
whether it was in our past life or this one,

100
00:07:53,700 --> 00:07:56,000
you haven't treated me well after marrying me.

101
00:07:58,080 --> 00:07:59,790
The more I think about it, the more I feel I've lost out.

102
00:08:02,620 --> 00:08:03,410
Alright.

103
00:08:21,750 --> 00:08:22,580
Does it hurt?

104
00:08:23,580 --> 00:08:24,370
It doesn't.

105
00:08:31,540 --> 00:08:33,790
You need to take good care of your face.

106
00:08:35,620 --> 00:08:37,250
It wouldn't be good if it left a scar.

107
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:38,870
Yes.

108
00:08:42,790 --> 00:08:44,160
Stay here tonight.

109
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,410
Princess...

110
00:08:53,830 --> 00:08:54,910
It's all right.

111
00:08:56,620 --> 00:08:59,620
I never force anyone to do what they don't want.

112
00:08:59,870 --> 00:09:01,080
If you don't want to,

113
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:04,290
you can just leave.

114
00:09:10,620 --> 00:09:13,370
Princess, forgive my offense.

115
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:24,000
Qiangqiang.

116
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:27,620
This is the latest storybook.

117
00:09:29,700 --> 00:09:32,200
This is the divorce letter the Young Lord promised you.

118
00:09:37,750 --> 00:09:38,540
I'm sorry.

119
00:09:40,330 --> 00:09:43,750
After all this time, I still haven't avenged you.

120
00:09:51,290 --> 00:09:52,580
If she knows from the afterlife,

121
00:09:53,580 --> 00:09:55,290
she surely wouldn't want to see you like this.

122
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:01,910
You're right.

123
00:10:03,620 --> 00:10:05,040
If Qiangqiang were here,

124
00:10:06,250 --> 00:10:08,450
she would definitely say I look ugly when I cry again.

125
00:10:14,580 --> 00:10:16,080
Young Lord, something has happened!
