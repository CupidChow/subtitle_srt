1
00:01:12,290 --> 00:01:13,700
Young Lord, something has happened.

2
00:01:14,790 --> 00:01:16,290
Miss Lin, the second daughter, took her own life last night.

3
00:01:16,830 --> 00:01:17,620
When the jailer found her,

4
00:01:17,620 --> 00:01:18,750
she was already not breathing.

5
00:01:26,410 --> 00:01:27,830
This was her own choice.

6
00:01:30,290 --> 00:01:31,160
I know.

7
00:01:33,080 --> 00:01:34,910
She didn't want to owe Xiao Jingyu a favor.

8
00:01:35,870 --> 00:01:36,790
Or perhaps,

9
00:01:37,580 --> 00:01:38,910
she wanted to use her own life

10
00:01:39,790 --> 00:01:41,910
to exchange for Xiao Jingyu's freedom.

11
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,700
She still cared for my second brother in her heart.

12
00:01:45,580 --> 00:01:47,580
My second brother's deep feelings for her were not in vain.

13
00:01:50,410 --> 00:01:51,660
Does the Second Young Master know?

14
00:01:51,910 --> 00:01:53,250
After Miss Lin was imprisoned,

15
00:01:53,540 --> 00:01:54,620
Lord Lin, to protect himself,

16
00:01:54,620 --> 00:01:56,410
severed his father-daughter relationship with her.

17
00:01:56,700 --> 00:01:58,450
This time, it was the Second Young Master who went to the prison

18
00:01:58,450 --> 00:01:59,870
to collect Miss Lin's body.

19
00:02:00,410 --> 00:02:01,250
But...

20
00:02:01,950 --> 00:02:02,790
But what?

21
00:02:04,290 --> 00:02:05,580
After the Second Young Master left the prison,

22
00:02:05,580 --> 00:02:07,330
he was summoned to the City Lord's residence.

23
00:02:07,410 --> 00:02:08,790
He still hasn't returned.

24
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,410
That is rather strange.

25
00:02:11,040 --> 00:02:12,540
The old City Lord has been ill.

26
00:02:12,540 --> 00:02:14,580
He has been bedridden for months and hasn't seen anyone.

27
00:02:14,750 --> 00:02:16,250
I'm afraid things aren't that simple.

28
00:02:18,330 --> 00:02:19,200
You go back first.

29
00:02:20,250 --> 00:02:21,450
I'll go take a look myself.

30
00:02:21,750 --> 00:02:22,790
I'll go with you.

31
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:27,080
You promised me.

32
00:02:27,410 --> 00:02:28,500
You'd do as I say in everything.

33
00:02:30,790 --> 00:02:34,620
Alright, let's go together.

34
00:02:59,950 --> 00:03:00,790
Elder sister.

35
00:03:01,410 --> 00:03:02,450
Greetings, Princess.

36
00:03:04,660 --> 00:03:05,660
It's you two.

37
00:03:05,870 --> 00:03:07,540
Is there something you need here?

38
00:03:07,660 --> 00:03:09,200
I brought Mingxuan to visit Father.

39
00:03:10,370 --> 00:03:12,580
Elder sister, what are you doing here?

40
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:19,370
It's all your fault.

41
00:03:19,830 --> 00:03:21,200
You're the young lord of the city.

42
00:03:21,290 --> 00:03:22,410
Father is seriously ill.

43
00:03:22,410 --> 00:03:23,870
But you haven't shown up at all.

44
00:03:24,250 --> 00:03:25,250
So I, as your elder sister,

45
00:03:25,250 --> 00:03:26,750
have to clean up your mess.

46
00:03:27,370 --> 00:03:28,620
All these official documents

47
00:03:28,620 --> 00:03:30,200
are giving me a headache.

48
00:03:30,790 --> 00:03:31,830
Thank you for your hard work, elder sister.

49
00:03:32,290 --> 00:03:34,580
In the future, just have someone send the documents to my residence.

50
00:03:34,790 --> 00:03:35,580
Alright.

51
00:03:36,410 --> 00:03:37,870
Weren't you going to see Father?

52
00:03:37,950 --> 00:03:39,040
He's in the Hall of Nurturing Heart.

53
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:40,910
Jingyu is there as well.

54
00:03:56,160 --> 00:03:56,950
Princess.

55
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:59,500
Lin Mingxuan seems to have recognized me.

56
00:04:00,790 --> 00:04:01,580
It's fine.

57
00:04:02,370 --> 00:04:04,040
If I were worried about you being recognized,

58
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:05,620
I wouldn't have kept you here.

59
00:04:09,290 --> 00:04:11,160
The guard next to the princess

60
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,950
looks familiar to me.

61
00:04:15,870 --> 00:04:17,450
Elder sister seems a bit different today.

62
00:04:20,290 --> 00:04:21,330
How is she different?

63
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:24,000
I can't quite say.

64
00:04:28,870 --> 00:04:30,330
Why aren't any of the guards here?

65
00:04:31,450 --> 00:04:33,660
Father! Father!

66
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:35,910
What's that smell?

67
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:43,330
It's a trap! Let's go!

68
00:04:51,660 --> 00:04:53,080
This incense is poisonous!

69
00:04:57,160 --> 00:04:57,950
Go!

70
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:01,910
Xiao Jingyang!

71
00:05:02,660 --> 00:05:03,750
I'm so dizzy.

72
00:05:03,750 --> 00:05:05,040
Find a place to hide.

73
00:05:13,620 --> 00:05:15,790
Lin Mingxuan, stay alert.

74
00:05:16,790 --> 00:05:18,410
Xiao Jingyang, your poison is acting up again.

75
00:05:18,750 --> 00:05:20,200
This smoke will trigger your poison.

76
00:05:20,830 --> 00:05:22,500
Hold your breath, Jingyang.

77
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:31,000
Jingyang

78
00:05:32,370 --> 00:05:34,370
I'm Mingxuan. Mingxuan.

79
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:37,950
I'm Mingxuan.

80
00:05:38,950 --> 00:05:41,950
Mingxuan, let's go.

81
00:06:13,620 --> 00:06:14,410
Elder sister

82
00:06:24,870 --> 00:06:26,160
Elder sister, why are you doing this?

83
00:06:26,540 --> 00:06:27,330
Jingyang

84
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:29,830
I never would have imagined

85
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:31,540
that you could actually do

86
00:06:31,620 --> 00:06:33,910
something as heinous as killing your own father

87
00:06:33,910 --> 00:06:35,040
What did you do to Father?

88
00:06:35,080 --> 00:06:37,160
When the young lord greeted the old lord,

89
00:06:37,410 --> 00:06:38,750
he had a fit of mania

90
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:41,160
and personally killed the old lord

91
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:42,290
Nonsense!

92
00:06:42,580 --> 00:06:44,120
Father wasn't even in the bedchamber

93
00:06:44,330 --> 00:06:46,120
I saw this with my own eyes

94
00:06:46,830 --> 00:06:48,580
If I hadn't arrived a moment earlier

95
00:06:48,620 --> 00:06:51,660
I'm afraid Lin Mingxuan would have died at your hands too

96
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:59,080
Killing your father and your wife

97
00:06:59,540 --> 00:07:00,830
So vicious

98
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:02,450
How are you fit to be the lord?

99
00:07:03,540 --> 00:07:04,370
Father

100
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:07,950
Mingxuan

101
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:15,040
Xiao Wenxi

102
00:07:15,660 --> 00:07:16,540
Be careful, Princess

103
00:07:28,410 --> 00:07:30,000
The crime of patricide you committed

104
00:07:30,370 --> 00:07:32,290
has already been made known to the world.

105
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:35,120
You will be executed soon.

106
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:36,910
That's right.

107
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:39,830
I did all of this.

108
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,200
It's just a pity you found out too late.

109
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:43,370
Now, you

110
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:45,040
are nothing more than

111
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:47,370
an ant I can crush at any time.

112
00:07:47,580 --> 00:07:48,500
Why?

113
00:07:49,250 --> 00:07:50,950
Father loved you so much.

114
00:07:50,950 --> 00:07:52,540
Why did you kill him?

115
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:54,950
Loved me?

116
00:07:57,330 --> 00:07:58,500
Is love treating me as

117
00:07:58,500 --> 00:08:00,290
a pawn to strengthen his hold on the court?

118
00:08:00,910 --> 00:08:01,700
Father...

119
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,660
The legitimate son of the Song family was born disabled.

120
00:08:04,910 --> 00:08:06,580
He has survived for years only by relying on medicine.

121
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:09,120
He's already got one foot in the grave.

122
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:11,790
Minister Song holds great prestige at court.

123
00:08:11,870 --> 00:08:12,950
If you don't marry him,

124
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:15,790
when Jingyang inherits the position of city lord in the future,

125
00:08:15,950 --> 00:08:20,450
the Song family may not fully support him.

126
00:08:21,540 --> 00:08:22,410
That day...

127
00:08:25,950 --> 00:08:27,790
That day, I was just like you.

128
00:08:30,410 --> 00:08:32,540
I knelt in front of his hall for a long time.

129
00:08:35,910 --> 00:08:38,330
I hoped Father would take back his order.

130
00:08:38,330 --> 00:08:39,620
And cancel the engagement.

131
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:44,000
But what I waited for was

132
00:08:44,540 --> 00:08:46,660
just an imperial edict from him.

133
00:08:46,660 --> 00:08:49,120
He sent me to the bed of that sickly man.

134
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:53,160
The legitimate son of the Song family died suddenly on his wedding night.

135
00:08:55,250 --> 00:08:58,000
A great fire raged at the Song residence all night.

136
00:08:59,870 --> 00:09:02,160
And you escaped disaster by running away from the marriage.

137
00:09:04,290 --> 00:09:06,370
All of this was part of your plan.

138
00:09:08,450 --> 00:09:10,160
That dying man

139
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:12,700
was worthy of marrying me?

140
00:09:13,540 --> 00:09:14,910
Shouldn't they have died?

141
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:17,080
Over a hundred lives in the Song family

142
00:09:17,870 --> 00:09:19,410
were killed just because you said so.

143
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:22,040
Even if Father was at fault in this matter,

144
00:09:22,620 --> 00:09:24,660
he has known all these years that he owes you.

145
00:09:24,660 --> 00:09:25,830
He has done his best to make it up to you.

146
00:09:25,830 --> 00:09:26,500
Enough!

147
00:09:38,290 --> 00:09:40,790
From the moment he abandoned me,

148
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:48,000
he was already dead to me.

149
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,160
Xiao Wenxi, you’re insane.

150
00:09:49,160 --> 00:09:50,580
I went insane long ago.

151
00:09:52,040 --> 00:09:54,500
Why were you born as the young lord?

152
00:09:55,580 --> 00:09:56,910
Why must women become

153
00:09:56,910 --> 00:09:58,750
tools for you to consolidate your power?

154
00:09:59,540 --> 00:10:01,750
It was from that moment that I realized

155
00:10:01,910 --> 00:10:04,660
only with supreme power

156
00:10:05,450 --> 00:10:07,620
can one control their own fate.

157
00:10:09,750 --> 00:10:10,540
That’s right.

158
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:13,540
I want everyone in the world to know

159
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:16,000
that whatever men can do,

160
00:10:16,450 --> 00:10:18,250
we women can do as well.

161
00:10:18,870 --> 00:10:20,540
So you poisoned me,

162
00:10:20,700 --> 00:10:23,450
used Lin Minghua to turn me against Second Brother,

163
00:10:26,870 --> 00:10:28,910
all for the position of city lord.
