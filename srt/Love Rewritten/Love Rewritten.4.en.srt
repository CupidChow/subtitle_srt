1
00:01:11,290 --> 00:01:12,290
What about your headache?

2
00:01:14,500 --> 00:01:15,620
Every time you had an episode before,

3
00:01:15,620 --> 00:01:16,660
you always avoided me.

4
00:01:17,370 --> 00:01:19,290
It was only during last night's episode that I realized

5
00:01:19,950 --> 00:01:21,080
just how much pain you were in.

6
00:01:22,910 --> 00:01:24,450
I've gotten used to the headaches.

7
00:01:26,290 --> 00:01:28,160
Next time the headache strikes,

8
00:01:28,410 --> 00:01:30,200
I'll find a way to switch our bodies back.

9
00:01:31,450 --> 00:01:32,250
Xiao Jingyang.

10
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:37,250
I'm not afraid of the pain.

11
00:01:37,750 --> 00:01:38,660
Then what is it?

12
00:01:39,910 --> 00:01:41,120
I can't possibly tell him

13
00:01:41,500 --> 00:01:43,120
that my heart aches for him.

14
00:01:44,080 --> 00:01:45,540
Lin Mingxuan, oh Lin Mingxuan,

15
00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:46,870
have some self-respect.

16
00:01:47,410 --> 00:01:49,450
Weren't you humble enough in love in your past life?

17
00:01:49,450 --> 00:01:50,290
I want to say,

18
00:01:51,540 --> 00:01:52,830
even though my medical skills aren't great,

19
00:01:53,660 --> 00:01:55,450
I could still try to help treat you.

20
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:58,830
No need.

21
00:02:00,620 --> 00:02:02,580
Once we've switched our bodies back,

22
00:02:03,160 --> 00:02:04,450
when my headache acts up,

23
00:02:05,620 --> 00:02:06,620
just stay far away from me.

24
00:02:17,290 --> 00:02:18,160
What is it?

25
00:02:19,290 --> 00:02:20,080
Young Madam,

26
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:21,660
Madam Wang has made a move.

27
00:02:21,910 --> 00:02:23,620
She went to the Second Young Master's residence.

28
00:02:23,620 --> 00:02:25,080
Not sure what she did there.

29
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:27,040
Now the Second Young Master is coming over with his people.

30
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:30,000
Inform the Young Lord.

31
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:31,200
In the time it takes to burn one incense stick,

32
00:02:31,370 --> 00:02:32,750
come with me to greet the Second Young Master.

33
00:02:32,750 --> 00:02:33,410
Yes.

34
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:37,290
Is there anything else?

35
00:02:37,290 --> 00:02:38,330
N-no, that's all.

36
00:02:38,540 --> 00:02:40,160
I'll go report to the Young Lord right away.

37
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:53,040
That's strange.

38
00:02:54,950 --> 00:02:57,040
Why am I listening to the Young Madam so much?

39
00:03:03,580 --> 00:03:04,370
Qiangqiang

40
00:03:06,950 --> 00:03:08,750
Third Brother, did you guess I would come?

41
00:03:08,950 --> 00:03:10,620
So you waited here early.

42
00:03:10,620 --> 00:03:11,830
Second Brother, what do you mean by this?

43
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:13,700
Qiangqiang is your sister-in-law, after all.

44
00:03:13,910 --> 00:03:15,080
How can you treat her like this?

45
00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:16,950
She went to my residence to steal today.

46
00:03:17,370 --> 00:03:19,660
Third Brother, did you know about this?

47
00:03:20,330 --> 00:03:22,250
Wang Yiqiang was instigated by someone to poison.

48
00:03:22,540 --> 00:03:24,120
Since she said she wanted to save you,

49
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:26,410
she must have been trying to find an antidote.

50
00:03:26,790 --> 00:03:28,250
It seems the person who incited Qiangqiang to poison

51
00:03:28,250 --> 00:03:29,580
is connected to Xiao Jingyu.

52
00:03:30,410 --> 00:03:31,910
But why didn't he try to cover it up?

53
00:03:32,580 --> 00:03:34,790
Instead, he even dared to come and demand an explanation.

54
00:03:35,410 --> 00:03:36,660
Second Young Master, please be careful with your words.

55
00:03:36,700 --> 00:03:38,450
Our Young Lord's residence lacks nothing.

56
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:40,160
Why would we need to steal from your residence?

57
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:40,910
That's right.

58
00:03:41,660 --> 00:03:43,040
Maybe you're just using Qiangqiang

59
00:03:43,290 --> 00:03:45,200
to deliberately smear our Young Lord's residence.

60
00:03:50,830 --> 00:03:51,870
Third Brother is right.

61
00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:54,120
I must have misunderstood this matter.

62
00:03:54,250 --> 00:03:56,370
I just heard that Third Brother was ill again last night.

63
00:03:56,370 --> 00:03:58,080
So I stopped by to check on him.

64
00:03:59,700 --> 00:04:02,000
You came to see if I’d been poisoned, didn’t you?

65
00:04:02,540 --> 00:04:04,120
Second Brother, you’re well-informed.

66
00:04:04,660 --> 00:04:05,910
But I’m already fine now.

67
00:04:06,290 --> 00:04:07,160
If that’s the case,

68
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:09,000
then I can rest assured.

69
00:04:09,290 --> 00:04:11,040
Zhulan, let’s go.

70
00:04:14,370 --> 00:04:15,830
I was the one who poisoned you.

71
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,160
I’m sorry, Young Lord.

72
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:19,250
Have I not treated you well?

73
00:04:19,870 --> 00:04:21,290
Why did you try to poison me?

74
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:23,000
You have treated me very well.

75
00:04:23,330 --> 00:04:26,370
So, I...

76
00:04:26,370 --> 00:04:27,870
So at the last moment,

77
00:04:27,870 --> 00:04:29,330
you grabbed the poisoned wine bottle.

78
00:04:30,660 --> 00:04:33,000
And you even risked stealing the antidote from Xiao Jingyu.

79
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,250
How did you know?

80
00:04:35,910 --> 00:04:37,540
The Young Madam ordered me to keep an eye on you.

81
00:04:37,540 --> 00:04:38,370
Wu Liuqi, you...

82
00:04:38,370 --> 00:04:40,200
Actually, ever since the day of the assassination in the woods,

83
00:04:40,290 --> 00:04:41,500
we’ve suspected you.

84
00:04:41,620 --> 00:04:43,200
Then why did you keep me by your side?

85
00:04:44,830 --> 00:04:46,080
Did you enjoy toying with me?

86
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:47,290
We weren’t toying with you.

87
00:04:47,620 --> 00:04:49,700
We just didn’t know if you were friend or foe.

88
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:50,870
But my father...

89
00:04:51,290 --> 00:04:52,750
Go ahead, say it.

90
00:04:55,410 --> 00:04:56,250
Wang Yiqiang,

91
00:04:56,370 --> 00:04:58,620
your father has already been transferred to the border by the Young Lord.

92
00:04:58,910 --> 00:05:01,120
He won’t be threatened by others anymore.

93
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:04,830
As long as you no longer work for Xiao Jingyu,

94
00:05:04,830 --> 00:05:07,410
we can let go of what happened before.

95
00:05:07,410 --> 00:05:09,000
If I hadn’t been forced by him,

96
00:05:09,290 --> 00:05:10,790
I would never have worked for him.

97
00:05:11,870 --> 00:05:12,660
Besides,

98
00:05:13,250 --> 00:05:14,830
I once wanted to kill you all.

99
00:05:15,540 --> 00:05:17,250
Do you really not care?

100
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:23,330
But you also risked your life to find a cure for me.

101
00:05:23,330 --> 00:05:24,120
Don't worry.

102
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:25,370
From now on, you can stay here.

103
00:05:25,450 --> 00:05:27,330
No one will force you to do anything you don't like.

104
00:05:27,580 --> 00:05:28,950
Young Lord, you really...

105
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:33,000
You're so kind.

106
00:05:33,700 --> 00:05:34,580
Mingxuan.

107
00:05:34,830 --> 00:05:36,160
I definitely won't interfere.

108
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:38,410
In the relationship between you and the Young Lord.

109
00:05:38,410 --> 00:05:39,870
When the right time comes,

110
00:05:40,330 --> 00:05:41,660
I'll divorce the Young Lord.

111
00:05:42,950 --> 00:05:43,620
Actually, we...

112
00:05:43,620 --> 00:05:44,290
Alright.

113
00:05:45,540 --> 00:05:46,620
What's going on?

114
00:05:46,950 --> 00:05:48,910
We were supposed to get divorced too.

115
00:05:56,620 --> 00:05:58,450
Jingyang, Mingxuan

116
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:04,410
Elder sister, you came unexpectedly.

117
00:06:05,330 --> 00:06:06,330
Is there something you need?

118
00:06:06,660 --> 00:06:08,870
Recently, an epidemic has been spreading in Liucheng.

119
00:06:09,370 --> 00:06:10,910
Jingyu recommended you to Father.

120
00:06:10,910 --> 00:06:12,040
He wants you to go provide disaster relief.

121
00:06:12,250 --> 00:06:13,330
Father agreed.

122
00:06:13,950 --> 00:06:16,160
He ordered you to go handle this matter privately first.

123
00:06:17,250 --> 00:06:19,540
Xiao Jingyu must be out of his mind.

124
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,080
With Jingyang's frail health,

125
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:24,540
how could he return from a place plagued by disease?

126
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:26,910
Jingyang,

127
00:06:27,580 --> 00:06:28,910
if you're not feeling well,

128
00:06:28,910 --> 00:06:30,910
you can talk to Father about it.

129
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:32,330
He would withdraw the order.

130
00:06:32,330 --> 00:06:33,410
I appreciate your kindness, Princess.

131
00:06:33,410 --> 00:06:34,620
I understand your concern.

132
00:06:35,660 --> 00:06:36,830
If this epidemic isn't eradicated,

133
00:06:37,330 --> 00:06:39,000
the people will suffer.

134
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:41,700
As the young city lord,

135
00:06:41,950 --> 00:06:43,790
this is my duty.

136
00:06:46,540 --> 00:06:47,660
Mingxuan is right.

137
00:06:47,950 --> 00:06:49,330
I was just worried and lost my composure.

138
00:06:49,540 --> 00:06:51,330
I forgot about Jingyang's responsibilities.

139
00:06:52,910 --> 00:06:54,290
Elder sister, you care about me too.

140
00:06:54,790 --> 00:06:55,830
I understand it all.

141
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:58,330
Come, have a seat.

142
00:06:58,330 --> 00:06:59,290
Let me take a look.

143
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:00,410
I haven't seen you in a few days.

144
00:07:00,410 --> 00:07:01,540
You've lost a lot of weight.

145
00:07:02,580 --> 00:07:03,370
It's nothing.

146
00:07:04,290 --> 00:07:05,080
Qiaoshan.

147
00:07:05,580 --> 00:07:06,830
Bring Wang Yiqiang here.

148
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:07,910
Yes.

149
00:07:07,910 --> 00:07:08,580
Wait.

150
00:07:08,580 --> 00:07:10,750
Why does elder sister want to see Yiqiang?

151
00:07:10,830 --> 00:07:11,950
Do you think that by hiding it for her,

152
00:07:11,950 --> 00:07:13,160
I wouldn't find out?

153
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:16,450
Wang Yiqiang is someone close to Jingyu.

154
00:07:16,540 --> 00:07:18,160
You should take this opportunity

155
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:19,660
to get rid of the spy by your side.

156
00:07:19,660 --> 00:07:21,160
But Yiqiang was forced into it.

157
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:22,660
I know you care about her.

158
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:24,620
But she can't be kept.

159
00:07:25,290 --> 00:07:26,080
Princess.

160
00:07:26,660 --> 00:07:27,910
Jingyang means

161
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:29,500
even if you get rid of Wang Yiqiang,

162
00:07:29,500 --> 00:07:30,750
there will just be another one.

163
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:33,330
It's better to use the Young Lord's fondness for Yiqiang

164
00:07:33,750 --> 00:07:35,790
to lower the Second Young Master's guard.

165
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:40,290
Forget it.

166
00:07:40,620 --> 00:07:41,950
After all, she's your woman.

167
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:43,500
You decide for yourself.

168
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:44,910
Thank you, elder sister.

169
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,040
Qiaoshan, let's go.

170
00:07:54,290 --> 00:07:55,450
Good thing you reacted quickly.

171
00:07:55,750 --> 00:07:57,250
Otherwise, Qiangqiang's life would be in danger.

172
00:07:57,250 --> 00:07:58,160
This matter

173
00:07:58,910 --> 00:08:01,000
is probably not as simple as it seems.

174
00:08:02,830 --> 00:08:03,620
Princess.

175
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:06,500
Jingyang is going to Liucheng this time.

176
00:08:06,910 --> 00:08:08,370
Follow him secretly.

177
00:08:08,870 --> 00:08:10,870
What happened last night must not happen again.

178
00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:12,290
Yes.

179
00:08:12,750 --> 00:08:15,000
There is one more thing to report to you, Princess.

180
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:15,790
Go ahead.

181
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:26,950
Speak.

182
00:08:41,370 --> 00:08:43,580
Ever since Jingyang fainted while kneeling in front of the palace,

183
00:08:44,370 --> 00:08:46,500
he has truly changed his temperament after waking up.

184
00:08:48,870 --> 00:08:50,500
As for this Lin Mingxuan,

185
00:08:52,830 --> 00:08:54,410
she is actually quite interesting.

186
00:08:56,580 --> 00:08:57,830
Alright, all the dishes are ready.

187
00:08:57,830 --> 00:08:58,750
Let's start eating.

188
00:09:00,580 --> 00:09:03,250
These are all raw.

189
00:09:03,250 --> 00:09:04,450
This is called hot pot.

190
00:09:05,410 --> 00:09:06,200
Watch closely.

191
00:09:06,830 --> 00:09:09,370
Pick up a piece of meat and dip it in.

192
00:09:15,950 --> 00:09:16,790
Try it.

193
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:30,950
It's delicious.

194
00:09:33,540 --> 00:09:35,700
Wait, it's so spicy!

195
00:09:36,870 --> 00:09:38,580
This is my favorite food.

196
00:09:39,250 --> 00:09:40,500
Wu Liuqi, Xiao Hongtao,

197
00:09:40,700 --> 00:09:41,910
you two sit down and eat with us.

198
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:42,830
With hot pot,

199
00:09:42,830 --> 00:09:43,910
the more people, the merrier.

200
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:51,000
First of all,

201
00:09:51,540 --> 00:09:53,750
let's officially welcome Qiangqiang as part of our family.

202
00:09:57,580 --> 00:09:59,080
From now on, if anyone dares to bully you,

203
00:09:59,080 --> 00:10:00,120
they'll be going against me,

204
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:04,410
and against the Young Lord's residence.

205
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:07,870
Young Lord,

206
00:10:07,950 --> 00:10:09,250
no need to be so moved.

207
00:10:09,790 --> 00:10:10,700
No,

208
00:10:12,950 --> 00:10:16,500
how many chili peppers did you put in this pot?

209
00:10:16,950 --> 00:10:18,580
It's so spicy!

210
00:10:24,290 --> 00:10:25,080
Eat up.

211
00:10:28,830 --> 00:10:29,620
Come on, eat, eat, eat.

212
00:10:32,950 --> 00:10:35,120
Come on, help me get that one.

213
00:10:35,290 --> 00:10:36,080
Here you go.

214
00:10:40,370 --> 00:10:41,160
Young Lord,

215
00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:42,910
we're not far from Liucheng here.

216
00:10:43,330 --> 00:10:44,750
Let's stay here for the night.

217
00:10:44,750 --> 00:10:45,370
Alright.

218
00:10:45,870 --> 00:10:46,700
I'm tired.

219
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,410
You all should go back and rest early too.

220
00:10:58,750 --> 00:11:02,080
The sickly young lord and his domineering little wife

221
00:11:03,160 --> 00:11:05,700
They really are a perfect match.

222
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:06,830
Madam Wang

223
00:11:07,250 --> 00:11:08,910
You are also the young lord's wife.

224
00:11:09,250 --> 00:11:10,910
Are you just going to stand by and watch

225
00:11:11,410 --> 00:11:12,950
the young lord and Lady Xuan being so affectionate?

226
00:11:13,250 --> 00:11:14,410
Starting today,

227
00:11:15,370 --> 00:11:17,950
I'm the number one fan of the Xuan-Yang couple.

228
00:11:18,450 --> 00:11:20,500
From now on, call me Heroine Wang.

229
00:11:21,700 --> 00:11:23,000
W-What are you doing?

230
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,250
Didn't we agree last night

231
00:11:24,250 --> 00:11:25,580
that we'd share a room these next few days?

232
00:11:25,580 --> 00:11:26,410
What? Me?

233
00:11:37,750 --> 00:11:38,580
Xiao Jingyang

234
00:11:42,870 --> 00:11:44,410
Xiao Jingyang

235
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,870
Even though we're married in name,

236
00:11:47,580 --> 00:11:48,870
I'm still not used to

237
00:11:48,870 --> 00:11:50,120
being so close to someone with my face.

238
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:51,080
So intimate.

239
00:11:56,200 --> 00:11:57,370
Ever since we left the city,

240
00:11:57,910 --> 00:11:59,410
someone has been following us.

241
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:01,370
For safety's sake,

242
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:04,410
you can't leave my sight these days.

243
00:12:04,450 --> 00:12:06,500
Then we...

244
00:12:08,790 --> 00:12:09,580
Wait.

245
00:12:10,580 --> 00:12:11,700
There's only one bed.

246
00:12:12,290 --> 00:12:13,910
You're not after my body,

247
00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:15,120
and tricking me on purpose, are you?

248
00:12:15,750 --> 00:12:16,870
Let me remind you,

249
00:12:17,290 --> 00:12:18,910
that's my body, you know.
