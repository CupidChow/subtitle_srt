1
00:01:26,500 --> 00:01:28,160
Second Young Master, Young Lord

2
00:01:28,830 --> 00:01:30,750
It was this person who stole your personal seal.

3
00:01:31,120 --> 00:01:32,200
His name is Sun San.

4
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:33,250
He works as a servant in the residence.

5
00:01:33,450 --> 00:01:34,500
Because he owed gambling debts,

6
00:01:34,580 --> 00:01:36,080
Magistrate Cao gave him some money

7
00:01:36,160 --> 00:01:37,750
and instigated him to steal your personal seal.

8
00:01:38,870 --> 00:01:39,910
Please spare me, Young Masters!

9
00:01:40,160 --> 00:01:41,450
I shouldn't have been so greedy for money.

10
00:01:41,870 --> 00:01:43,830
Where did you make the exchange with that person?

11
00:01:44,120 --> 00:01:44,910
Miss,

12
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,160
thanks to your timely arrival,

13
00:01:46,160 --> 00:01:47,160
otherwise, if I had run into them,

14
00:01:47,160 --> 00:01:48,750
I wouldn't have made it back to Liucheng.

15
00:01:48,870 --> 00:01:50,500
The master has always acted cautiously.

16
00:01:50,500 --> 00:01:51,370
But you,

17
00:01:51,410 --> 00:01:52,870
why didn't you kill her?

18
00:01:53,410 --> 00:01:54,660
I was going to kill her.

19
00:01:54,660 --> 00:01:56,080
But right before I did,

20
00:01:56,290 --> 00:01:59,540
she told me something very important.

21
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:00,870
What was it?

22
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:01,870
She said,

23
00:02:02,660 --> 00:02:03,910
if I killed her,

24
00:02:04,910 --> 00:02:09,120
would Miss also kill me to silence me?

25
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:11,540
You actually believed such obvious provocation?

26
00:02:11,910 --> 00:02:12,750
Our Miss

27
00:02:12,750 --> 00:02:14,620
is not someone who would betray her own people.

28
00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:17,540
She even specially prepared

29
00:02:17,540 --> 00:02:18,700
travel expenses for your return.

30
00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:23,040
Second Miss has been so good to me.

31
00:02:23,330 --> 00:02:24,830
How could I listen to you?

32
00:02:26,290 --> 00:02:27,080
Idiot.

33
00:02:27,370 --> 00:02:28,790
You're even stupid enough to walk right in.

34
00:02:28,790 --> 00:02:29,410
You—

35
00:02:34,750 --> 00:02:35,620
What are you going to do?

36
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:37,700
It's your turn this time.

37
00:02:41,910 --> 00:02:43,500
Wretch, you still want to run?

38
00:02:50,950 --> 00:02:51,910
To kill you,

39
00:02:51,910 --> 00:02:53,450
we went to a lot of trouble.

40
00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:54,830
Do you think you can escape?

41
00:02:57,540 --> 00:02:58,370
Mingxuan.

42
00:02:59,410 --> 00:03:00,200
Mingxuan.

43
00:03:01,540 --> 00:03:02,370
Mingxuan.

44
00:03:06,830 --> 00:03:09,500
Mingxuan, are you alright?

45
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:10,330
Xiao Jingyang.

46
00:03:13,580 --> 00:03:14,370
It hurts.

47
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:16,370
I'll take you to see a doctor.

48
00:03:16,540 --> 00:03:17,330
I'm fine.

49
00:03:17,830 --> 00:03:19,370
I just fainted from the fall.

50
00:03:20,410 --> 00:03:21,620
Then the blood on you...

51
00:03:24,870 --> 00:03:25,910
It's someone else's.

52
00:03:30,250 --> 00:03:31,450
Too bad he's dead.

53
00:03:31,580 --> 00:03:32,910
He got off easy.

54
00:03:33,580 --> 00:03:35,410
How dare he use me as a target!

55
00:03:35,870 --> 00:03:36,660
Zhulan.

56
00:03:36,950 --> 00:03:38,620
Investigate this matter thoroughly for me.

57
00:03:38,830 --> 00:03:39,620
Yes.

58
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:44,000
Xiao Jingyang.

59
00:03:44,700 --> 00:03:46,410
You still won't admit you care about me.

60
00:03:46,830 --> 00:03:48,200
Even if it were someone else today,

61
00:03:48,540 --> 00:03:49,500
I would have saved them too.

62
00:03:50,330 --> 00:03:51,620
If you really don't care about me,

63
00:03:52,660 --> 00:03:53,750
then what is this?

64
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:06,410
I lost my token a few days ago.

65
00:04:06,580 --> 00:04:07,830
Thank you, Miss Lin, for finding it.

66
00:04:09,660 --> 00:04:10,450
Wu Liuqi.

67
00:04:11,580 --> 00:04:12,370
Young Lord.

68
00:04:12,580 --> 00:04:13,750
Escort Miss Lin back to her residence.

69
00:04:13,870 --> 00:04:14,540
Yes.

70
00:04:14,540 --> 00:04:15,330
Xiao Jingyang.

71
00:04:15,620 --> 00:04:16,790
Is admitting you like me

72
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:18,450
really that embarrassing for you?

73
00:04:22,750 --> 00:04:23,950
As long as you say it yourself,

74
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:25,750
that you've never liked me,

75
00:04:26,580 --> 00:04:28,290
I won't bother you again in the future.

76
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:33,830
Xiao Jingyang, Young Lord.

77
00:04:38,830 --> 00:04:41,040
I've already applied the acupuncture as Master instructed.

78
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:43,450
Why isn't there any improvement?

79
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:47,790
Young Madam,

80
00:04:49,830 --> 00:04:51,660
there's something Young Lord didn't want me to tell you.

81
00:04:53,290 --> 00:04:54,370
But after much consideration,

82
00:04:55,250 --> 00:04:56,620
I feel I shouldn't keep it from you.

83
00:05:00,290 --> 00:05:01,580
Please, you can tell me.

84
00:05:01,950 --> 00:05:03,870
Although this is your first time being reborn after death,

85
00:05:05,620 --> 00:05:08,080
for the Young Lord,

86
00:05:08,910 --> 00:05:10,250
this has already happened five times.

87
00:05:12,370 --> 00:05:13,200
What?

88
00:05:14,790 --> 00:05:15,950
How is that possible?

89
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,250
In every past life,

90
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:22,870
you died to save the Young Lord.

91
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:26,250
But in this life,

92
00:05:27,700 --> 00:05:29,160
it was the Young Lord who begged for it.

93
00:05:29,330 --> 00:05:31,580
He did it to defy fate and change your destiny.

94
00:05:32,410 --> 00:05:33,750
To protect you for a lifetime.

95
00:05:34,410 --> 00:05:35,620
Marrying Wang Yiqiang

96
00:05:35,620 --> 00:05:36,830
was also part of changing fate.

97
00:05:37,830 --> 00:05:39,790
So every time he pushed me away,

98
00:05:40,330 --> 00:05:41,750
it was actually to save me.

99
00:05:42,330 --> 00:05:44,040
The Young Lord only wishes for your safety in this life.

100
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:45,950
But this secret art of defying fate

101
00:05:46,250 --> 00:05:48,040
will inevitably keep taking a toll on his life.

102
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:50,330
Even if he wasn't poisoned,

103
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:51,950
I'm afraid

104
00:05:53,700 --> 00:05:55,160
I'm afraid that even in this life, the Young Lord...

105
00:06:00,410 --> 00:06:01,700
Please, I beg you, save him!

106
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:03,000
Young Madam,

107
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:06,160
if there were a way,

108
00:06:06,620 --> 00:06:08,040
of course I would want to save him.

109
00:06:10,290 --> 00:06:11,120
But...

110
00:06:20,950 --> 00:06:21,830
Mingxuan,

111
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:24,040
Mingxuan, don't...

112
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:26,870
Mingxuan!

113
00:06:29,870 --> 00:06:30,660
Mingxuan!

114
00:06:31,660 --> 00:06:32,450
Jingyang!

115
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:37,120
I'm here, I'm here.

116
00:06:37,910 --> 00:06:39,290
Mingxuan, don't cry.

117
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:46,500
Mingxuan, don't cry.

118
00:06:47,410 --> 00:06:48,200
Don't.

119
00:06:52,580 --> 00:06:53,450
I'm fine.

120
00:06:54,370 --> 00:06:55,620
You'll be fine too.

121
00:06:56,790 --> 00:06:59,200
This time, we'll both be okay.

122
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:03,410
It's useless, it's useless.

123
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:06,660
The outcome was already decided.

124
00:07:08,540 --> 00:07:09,660
No matter what,

125
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:11,580
we can't change it.

126
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:13,500
It's unchangeable.

127
00:07:18,830 --> 00:07:19,620
Jingyang.

128
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:27,870
Jingyang.

129
00:07:42,290 --> 00:07:43,080
Jingyang.

130
00:07:44,950 --> 00:07:47,620
This time, let me save you.

131
00:07:52,660 --> 00:07:53,450
Second Young Master.

132
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:56,080
Sun San is dead.

133
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:57,040
How did he die?

134
00:07:57,410 --> 00:07:58,500
When the jailer found him,

135
00:07:58,540 --> 00:08:00,540
his face was ashen and his limbs were stiff.

136
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:02,160
It looked like he was poisoned.

137
00:08:04,620 --> 00:08:07,080
Someone actually dared to kill right under my nose.

138
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,250
They want to cut off the clues.

139
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:13,000
Zhulan.

140
00:08:13,290 --> 00:08:14,830
I will investigate and find out as soon as possible.

141
00:08:15,290 --> 00:08:16,120
However,

142
00:08:16,580 --> 00:08:18,120
what if the person we find is...

143
00:08:18,290 --> 00:08:19,290
No matter who it is,

144
00:08:20,250 --> 00:08:22,620
if anyone dares to sow discord between me and my third brother,

145
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:24,750
they must pay the price.

146
00:08:25,870 --> 00:08:26,700
Yes.

147
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:27,790
Also,

148
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:31,080
don't let the person behind this harm Minghua.

149
00:08:31,370 --> 00:08:33,120
We must strengthen the guard to protect her.

150
00:08:33,450 --> 00:08:34,250
Yes.

151
00:08:39,410 --> 00:08:40,250
You bastard.

152
00:08:40,750 --> 00:08:41,580
Such a good opportunity,

153
00:08:41,580 --> 00:08:42,950
and you still couldn't kill Lin Mingxuan.

154
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:44,000
Miss, please calm your anger.

155
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:44,870
I didn't expect it either.

156
00:08:44,870 --> 00:08:46,410
The young city lord and his people arrived so quickly.

157
00:08:46,620 --> 00:08:47,700
This Lin Mingxuan

158
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,040
is really lucky to be alive.

159
00:10:14,330 --> 00:10:15,160
You're awake.

160
00:10:15,910 --> 00:10:17,790
How are you? Does your head still hurt?

161
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:19,330
Is there anywhere else you feel unwell?

162
00:10:19,330 --> 00:10:20,080
I'm fine.

163
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:23,330
You shouldn't be here.
