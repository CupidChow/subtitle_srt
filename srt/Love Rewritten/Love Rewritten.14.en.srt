1
00:01:11,950 --> 00:01:13,160
My third brother

2
00:01:13,410 --> 00:01:15,120
is truly a hopeless romantic.

3
00:01:16,330 --> 00:01:17,580
If we follow the second young master's orders

4
00:01:17,580 --> 00:01:18,750
and keep investigating,

5
00:01:19,330 --> 00:01:20,950
I'm afraid Miss Lin will be exposed.

6
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,750
If a pawn isn't useful,

7
00:01:26,830 --> 00:01:29,200
keeping it is just a burden.

8
00:01:33,080 --> 00:01:34,250
You may leave for now.

9
00:01:35,370 --> 00:01:36,160
Yes.

10
00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:42,620
Is there something else?

11
00:01:47,080 --> 00:01:47,870
Your Highness,

12
00:01:48,910 --> 00:01:50,330
am I also just a pawn to you?

13
00:01:56,830 --> 00:01:57,620
You...

14
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:00,620
Of course you're different.

15
00:02:04,580 --> 00:02:05,870
You are

16
00:02:07,450 --> 00:02:10,950
the most important person to me.

17
00:02:21,410 --> 00:02:22,580
Why are we running?

18
00:02:23,750 --> 00:02:25,290
The person behind this is after us.

19
00:02:25,950 --> 00:02:27,160
If Second Brother were with us,

20
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:28,500
I'm afraid that person wouldn't show up.

21
00:02:28,620 --> 00:02:29,410
Besides,

22
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:32,410
ever since Second Brother joined us,

23
00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:33,700
the people originally assigned to protect us

24
00:02:33,700 --> 00:02:35,870
have all disappeared.

25
00:02:35,910 --> 00:02:37,540
He really did come to protect us.

26
00:02:37,790 --> 00:02:38,620
He was supposed to.

27
00:02:39,750 --> 00:02:40,620
But now,

28
00:02:41,290 --> 00:02:43,200
I suspect there are spies around him too.

29
00:02:43,580 --> 00:02:44,830
Then what should we do?

30
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:46,120
I'll go distract them.

31
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:47,290
No.

32
00:02:49,330 --> 00:02:50,120
Don't worry.

33
00:02:50,450 --> 00:02:51,370
I have a plan.

34
00:02:51,830 --> 00:02:52,830
If you stay by my side,

35
00:02:52,830 --> 00:02:53,950
I won't feel at ease.

36
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:56,700
Then be careful in everything.

37
00:02:56,870 --> 00:02:57,870
I'll wait for your return.

38
00:03:00,410 --> 00:03:01,200
Wu Liuqi.

39
00:03:01,370 --> 00:03:02,160
Young Lord.

40
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:03,290
Protect the Young Lady.

41
00:03:03,290 --> 00:03:03,910
No.

42
00:03:03,910 --> 00:03:05,160
Wu Liuqi will stay to protect you.

43
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:05,750
No.

44
00:03:05,750 --> 00:03:07,330
Their ultimate target is you.

45
00:03:07,580 --> 00:03:08,580
If you don't agree,

46
00:03:08,910 --> 00:03:09,750
I won't leave either.

47
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:13,910
Alright.

48
00:03:15,410 --> 00:03:16,500
Then be careful.

49
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:21,250
Protect the Young Lady.

50
00:03:21,450 --> 00:03:22,370
Yes, Young Lord.

51
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:34,120
Let's go.

52
00:03:38,870 --> 00:03:39,870
Lin Mingxuan.

53
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Go to hell!

54
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:43,870
Mingxuan!

55
00:03:46,290 --> 00:03:47,120
Are you okay?

56
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:48,000
I'm fine.

57
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,540
Second Young Master saved me.

58
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:51,910
Where's Third Brother?

59
00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:53,410
They just went over there.

60
00:03:54,410 --> 00:03:55,290
It's dangerous here.

61
00:03:55,290 --> 00:03:56,450
You should hurry back.

62
00:04:01,160 --> 00:04:02,870
He really did come to save us.

63
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:04,290
Let's not worry about that now.

64
00:04:04,370 --> 00:04:05,250
Let's go quickly.

65
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:06,910
Hurry, throw it away!

66
00:04:07,870 --> 00:04:08,660
Go!

67
00:04:28,450 --> 00:04:29,250
Minghua.

68
00:04:34,750 --> 00:04:36,250
I didn't expect your martial arts to be so good.

69
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:38,870
I underestimated you before.

70
00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:39,870
Otherwise,

71
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:41,580
why do you think the Young Lord was at ease

72
00:04:41,580 --> 00:04:43,040
letting Mingxuan return to the manor alone?

73
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:44,870
If she hadn't separated from the Young Lord,

74
00:04:44,910 --> 00:04:46,450
how could we have lured you out?

75
00:04:46,450 --> 00:04:48,450
So this was all your plan.

76
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,080
I want to see

77
00:04:50,290 --> 00:04:52,040
who is so determined to take my life.

78
00:04:54,830 --> 00:04:56,080
So it really is you.

79
00:04:56,620 --> 00:04:58,200
So you knew it was me all along.

80
00:04:58,200 --> 00:04:59,870
There aren't many people in this world who hate me.

81
00:05:00,450 --> 00:05:01,290
One person—

82
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:03,870
my sister, who is determined to step over me.

83
00:05:03,910 --> 00:05:05,250
And you, as her dog,

84
00:05:05,790 --> 00:05:06,870
are no exception.

85
00:05:06,870 --> 00:05:07,700
Mingxuan.

86
00:05:08,410 --> 00:05:09,750
What should we do now?

87
00:05:10,620 --> 00:05:12,160
Should we just kill her right away,

88
00:05:12,410 --> 00:05:15,000
or take her back for the young lord to deal with?

89
00:05:16,290 --> 00:05:17,450
Miss

90
00:05:17,620 --> 00:05:19,200
Please spare me.

91
00:05:19,290 --> 00:05:21,450
It was Second Miss who told me to do this.

92
00:05:21,580 --> 00:05:23,870
I was only following her orders.

93
00:05:23,910 --> 00:05:24,910
Miss

94
00:05:26,950 --> 00:05:27,750
Young Madam

95
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:28,950
Zhulan

96
00:05:28,950 --> 00:05:31,330
The second young master ordered me to escort you both back.

97
00:05:31,790 --> 00:05:32,870
The second young master is thoughtful.

98
00:05:32,910 --> 00:05:33,790
What are you standing around for?

99
00:05:33,790 --> 00:05:34,830
Hurry up and do it!

100
00:05:39,330 --> 00:05:40,040
Young Lord

101
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:41,290
These people are all death warriors.

102
00:05:41,290 --> 00:05:42,700
There are no clues on them.

103
00:05:45,790 --> 00:05:46,580
Young Lord

104
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:49,120
Return to the residence immediately.

105
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:50,790
Yes.

106
00:06:03,330 --> 00:06:04,750
They don't know their place.

107
00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:14,660
Qiangqiang

108
00:06:16,330 --> 00:06:18,660
No, Qiangqiang!

109
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:21,290
It's your turn, Miss.

110
00:06:22,870 --> 00:06:24,450
Xiao Jingyang is here! Retreat quickly!

111
00:06:26,540 --> 00:06:28,330
Qiangqiang! Qiangqiang!

112
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:29,910
Go get a doctor!

113
00:06:29,910 --> 00:06:30,580
Yes.

114
00:06:31,580 --> 00:06:33,160
I won't let anything happen to you.

115
00:06:33,370 --> 00:06:35,500
Qiangqiang! Qiangqiang!

116
00:06:39,290 --> 00:06:40,200
Don't cry.

117
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:43,040
You'll look bad if you cry.

118
00:06:43,790 --> 00:06:45,370
Why does it get dirtier the more I wipe?

119
00:06:46,910 --> 00:06:49,250
It's not dirty, it's not dirty.

120
00:06:51,250 --> 00:06:52,040
Qiangqiang

121
00:06:53,410 --> 00:06:55,290
Didn't you promise me?

122
00:06:55,450 --> 00:06:57,870
That you'd be my best friend for life.

123
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,700
You promised me.

124
00:07:00,910 --> 00:07:02,870
You said you would help me get Xiao Jingyang back.

125
00:07:03,250 --> 00:07:04,700
You must not break your promise.

126
00:07:06,450 --> 00:07:08,250
I'm just a little tired.

127
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:10,790
I want to take a nap.

128
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:12,120
You can't sleep.

129
00:07:12,370 --> 00:07:14,160
Wake up, look at me.

130
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:15,500
Look at me.

131
00:07:19,540 --> 00:07:20,330
Young Lord.

132
00:07:23,910 --> 00:07:26,620
I beg you to promise me two things.

133
00:07:26,830 --> 00:07:27,620
Go ahead.

134
00:07:28,750 --> 00:07:29,620
First,

135
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:33,580
I want a divorce letter.

136
00:07:35,290 --> 00:07:36,080
Alright.

137
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:40,910
Second,

138
00:07:44,290 --> 00:07:47,040
I'm entrusting my best friend to you.

139
00:07:53,370 --> 00:07:55,450
You must take good care of her for me.

140
00:07:56,120 --> 00:07:56,910
Okay.

141
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:10,160
Don't cry.

142
00:08:13,910 --> 00:08:15,870
If you keep crying, you won't look good.

143
00:08:21,330 --> 00:08:23,620
Where's my medicine? Where's my medicine?

144
00:08:23,620 --> 00:08:24,370
Where did my medicine go?

145
00:08:24,370 --> 00:08:25,370
Mingxuan, calm down.

146
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:27,410
I don't want to calm down.

147
00:08:27,410 --> 00:08:29,000
I want her to live.

148
00:08:32,370 --> 00:08:34,410
I'm so glad I met you all.

149
00:08:35,660 --> 00:08:39,410
It's a pity I haven't finished illustrating my storybook.

150
00:08:39,410 --> 00:08:40,080
Qiangqiang.

151
00:08:42,540 --> 00:08:43,410
The doctor is here.

152
00:08:44,830 --> 00:08:45,620
Hurry!

153
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:47,910
Hemostatic medicine.

154
00:08:49,250 --> 00:08:50,830
Hemostatic medicine, stop the bleeding!

155
00:08:51,790 --> 00:08:54,120
Hemostatic medicine, hemostatic medicine!

156
00:08:54,660 --> 00:08:55,830
The hemostatic medicine is here!

157
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:56,870
Hemostatic medicine.

158
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:08,870
Qiangqiang.

159
00:09:11,410 --> 00:09:12,200
Qiangqiang.

160
00:09:13,750 --> 00:09:14,660
Qiangqiang.

161
00:09:21,080 --> 00:09:22,250
Let me call you Qiangqiang.

162
00:09:22,250 --> 00:09:23,040
It feels more friendly this way.

163
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:23,700
Qiangqiang.

164
00:09:23,910 --> 00:09:26,750
Officially welcome Qiangqiang to our family.

165
00:09:31,830 --> 00:09:34,330
Sure, that's loyal of you.

166
00:09:34,700 --> 00:09:35,910
From today on,

167
00:09:36,450 --> 00:09:37,750
we are sisters.

168
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:50,370
The sickly young lord and his domineering little wife

169
00:09:50,790 --> 00:09:52,540
really are a perfect match.

170
00:09:53,290 --> 00:09:54,330
Starting today,

171
00:09:54,540 --> 00:09:56,950
I'm the number one fan of the Xuanyang couple.

172
00:09:57,250 --> 00:09:59,120
From now on, call me Lady Knight Wang.

173
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:00,370
Once I get the divorce papers,

174
00:10:00,620 --> 00:10:03,500
I'll either go to the battlefield with my father to fight the enemy,

175
00:10:03,870 --> 00:10:06,290
or I'll roam the world with my sword.

176
00:10:06,950 --> 00:10:09,450
From now on, call me Lady Knight Wang.
