1
00:01:22,250 --> 00:01:24,500
Mingxuan, you're awake.

2
00:01:26,580 --> 00:01:29,790
Master, why am I...

3
00:01:30,120 --> 00:01:31,080
...here?

4
00:01:32,410 --> 00:01:33,790
If I hadn't gone looking for you,

5
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,200
you would have frozen to death by the sea with him.

6
00:01:47,330 --> 00:01:48,410
He's gone.

7
00:01:50,330 --> 00:01:53,700
No one will do my hair and makeup for me anymore.

8
00:01:55,790 --> 00:01:58,290
No one will cook for me anymore.

9
00:02:01,370 --> 00:02:05,790
No one will ever love and spoil me like he did.

10
00:02:08,750 --> 00:02:09,620
Mingxuan.

11
00:02:10,540 --> 00:02:11,330
Master.

12
00:02:12,450 --> 00:02:13,750
I don't want to be sad.

13
00:02:16,370 --> 00:02:18,410
I thought that after seeing him off,

14
00:02:19,330 --> 00:02:20,540
I could hold back my feelings.

15
00:02:22,870 --> 00:02:25,200
But now I really can't bear it.

16
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:29,910
Please just let me cry.

17
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:32,330
Just let me cry once.

18
00:02:41,250 --> 00:02:43,250
Go ahead, cry.

19
00:02:52,660 --> 00:02:54,290
But you have to take your medicine.

20
00:03:00,700 --> 00:03:01,500
Mingxuan.

21
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:03,790
It's okay to be sad,

22
00:03:05,540 --> 00:03:07,910
but you have to think about the child inside you.

23
00:03:13,790 --> 00:03:14,580
Master.

24
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:18,250
Are you saying I...

25
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:21,040
I've taught you medicine for so many years,

26
00:03:21,410 --> 00:03:23,200
and you can't even recognize a pregnancy pulse?

27
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:25,790
You must rest well.

28
00:03:26,830 --> 00:03:28,410
Even if it's just for the child's sake.

29
00:03:31,410 --> 00:03:32,200
Drink it.

30
00:03:43,370 --> 00:03:44,160
Jingyang.

31
00:03:46,450 --> 00:03:50,410
Did you send this child to keep me company in your place?

32
00:03:56,120 --> 00:03:59,500
If you knew I was carrying your child,

33
00:04:01,160 --> 00:04:02,790
would you be happy?

34
00:04:40,660 --> 00:04:41,910
Have you really made up your mind?

35
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:48,580
I promised Xiao Jingyang

36
00:04:49,540 --> 00:04:51,700
to see the mountains and rivers for him

37
00:04:53,620 --> 00:04:55,580
and to retrace the path we once walked.

38
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:58,040
Master, don't worry.

39
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:00,830
I will take good care of myself

40
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:12,660
and this child.

41
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:16,790
Very well, go ahead.

42
00:05:17,700 --> 00:05:19,500
You can come back whenever you want.

43
00:05:19,580 --> 00:05:21,620
I will always be here waiting for you.

44
00:05:26,580 --> 00:05:27,620
Take care, Master.

45
00:05:56,040 --> 00:05:57,290
I promise you, that's all.

46
00:05:57,330 --> 00:05:58,330
Please, get up first.

47
00:06:02,700 --> 00:06:03,830
Thank you, Master.

48
00:06:03,830 --> 00:06:06,040
Even if I help you deceive her with fake pregnancy medicine,

49
00:06:06,450 --> 00:06:07,660
in ten months' time,

50
00:06:07,660 --> 00:06:09,120
won't she find out anyway?

51
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:10,620
Why put yourself through this?

52
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,290
You are her master.

53
00:06:13,290 --> 00:06:14,500
You should understand her.

54
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,370
If she has no reason to keep living,

55
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:20,950
I'm afraid she...

56
00:06:24,250 --> 00:06:26,200
Ten months is enough time for her to calm down.

57
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:29,040
All I wish for

58
00:06:31,830 --> 00:06:34,450
is for her to live out the rest of her life in peace.

59
00:06:55,830 --> 00:06:56,660
Tell me,

60
00:06:57,200 --> 00:06:59,000
does Xiao Jingyang dislike me?

61
00:06:59,790 --> 00:07:00,580
Sister,

62
00:07:00,620 --> 00:07:02,080
can you be a little more confident?

63
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:04,660
If Shaojun dislikes anyone, it would never be you.

64
00:07:20,450 --> 00:07:21,290
Delicious.

65
00:07:24,620 --> 00:07:25,870
Yours isn't cooked yet.

66
00:07:26,290 --> 00:07:27,080
Come on, come on.

67
00:07:27,250 --> 00:07:28,250
Cheers, cheers!

68
00:07:28,250 --> 00:07:28,660
Cheers!

69
00:07:28,660 --> 00:07:29,660
Alright, cheers!

70
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:31,790
Eat more.

71
00:07:34,250 --> 00:07:35,160
It's really tasty.

72
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:38,290
Here you go.

73
00:07:41,830 --> 00:07:42,830
The road ahead is long.

74
00:07:45,450 --> 00:07:46,410
Until we meet again.

75
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:13,370
Xiao Jingyang.

76
00:08:15,620 --> 00:08:17,080
We're going home.
