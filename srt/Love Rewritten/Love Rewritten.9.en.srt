1
00:01:21,290 --> 00:01:22,910
Isn't this the young lord's wife?

2
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:25,040
What brings you back to your family home today?

3
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:25,910
Miss

4
00:01:26,120 --> 00:01:27,950
Our young lady is talking to you.

5
00:01:29,450 --> 00:01:31,250
I just ran into a stray dog barking on the way.

6
00:01:31,330 --> 00:01:32,330
Why should I bother responding?

7
00:01:32,330 --> 00:01:33,700
How dare you insult me!

8
00:01:34,330 --> 00:01:35,410
So what if I insult you?

9
00:01:35,500 --> 00:01:36,370
I'm warning you.

10
00:01:36,370 --> 00:01:37,580
I'm in a bad mood today.

11
00:01:37,580 --> 00:01:38,700
You'd better not mess with me.

12
00:01:38,870 --> 00:01:41,120
Didn't the young lord just divorce you?

13
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:42,330
It was only a matter of time.

14
00:01:42,370 --> 00:01:44,500
Sister, why can't you just let it go?

15
00:01:44,750 --> 00:01:46,500
You won't listen when I try to talk nicely, will you?

16
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:47,660
You're forcing me to take action.

17
00:01:48,250 --> 00:01:49,830
This isn't the young lord's residence.

18
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,540
You dare to fight me here?

19
00:01:53,370 --> 00:01:54,200
Miss

20
00:01:55,250 --> 00:01:56,120
Lin Mingxuan

21
00:01:56,250 --> 00:01:57,290
How dare you hit me!

22
00:01:57,290 --> 00:01:58,450
I'll fight you to the end!

23
00:02:07,410 --> 00:02:08,790
I'll beat you to death!

24
00:02:12,750 --> 00:02:13,830
You little brat!

25
00:02:14,830 --> 00:02:16,200
The upbringing of our Lin family

26
00:02:16,450 --> 00:02:17,910
has been completely disgraced by you!

27
00:02:18,750 --> 00:02:21,540
You actually fought each other in public!

28
00:02:24,870 --> 00:02:25,700
Father!

29
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,700
It was sister who started it!

30
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:29,790
Only because you have such a foul mouth!

31
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:31,580
I'll teach you how to behave!

32
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,250
If you act like this outside the residence

33
00:02:33,450 --> 00:02:35,000
and disgrace your father, what then?

34
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:35,620
You—

35
00:02:35,870 --> 00:02:36,830
Father, look!

36
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,160
She not only hit me,

37
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:40,200
she also openly slanders and insults me!

38
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:41,700
Enough! All of you, be quiet!

39
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:44,000
You all

40
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:46,410
kneel here and stay put!

41
00:02:47,330 --> 00:02:48,660
You can get up

42
00:02:48,750 --> 00:02:49,830
when you realize your mistake.

43
00:02:52,040 --> 00:02:52,910
Father!

44
00:03:03,290 --> 00:03:04,540
You jinx.

45
00:03:05,250 --> 00:03:07,040
Every time you come home, I end up being punished and made to kneel.

46
00:03:07,910 --> 00:03:10,160
I'll settle this score with you sooner or later.

47
00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:12,290
Do you think you haven't suffered enough from kneeling?

48
00:03:12,370 --> 00:03:13,830
How about we try it again, just the two of us?

49
00:03:13,830 --> 00:03:14,620
You—

50
00:03:15,660 --> 00:03:17,620
Isn't it just because you have Xiao Jingyang backing you up?

51
00:03:17,620 --> 00:03:18,580
Don't think I don't know.

52
00:03:18,580 --> 00:03:19,950
You two are hiding something.

53
00:03:20,660 --> 00:03:22,870
Then why don't you tell me what the secret is?

54
00:03:23,370 --> 00:03:25,660
You're not Lin Mingxuan, are you?

55
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:29,290
And the one in the City Lord's mansion now

56
00:03:29,580 --> 00:03:30,950
isn't Xiao Jingyang either.

57
00:03:31,450 --> 00:03:32,910
The certainty in her tone...

58
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:34,160
Could it be that she knows

59
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:36,200
about the body swap between me and Xiao Jingyang?

60
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:38,620
But nothing stays hidden forever.

61
00:03:39,450 --> 00:03:40,790
If the old City Lord

62
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:43,500
finds out that right under his nose

63
00:03:43,870 --> 00:03:46,330
you're using sorcery to manipulate people,

64
00:03:46,830 --> 00:03:48,370
how do you think he'll react?

65
00:03:48,580 --> 00:03:49,290
Go ahead and try.

66
00:03:49,290 --> 00:03:51,200
Then you'll know exactly how the old City Lord feels.

67
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:52,450
Don't think I won't dare.

68
00:03:53,830 --> 00:03:54,620
Who's there?

69
00:03:56,330 --> 00:03:57,580
Who's pretending to be a ghost over there?

70
00:03:57,790 --> 00:03:58,580
Miss!

71
00:03:58,700 --> 00:04:00,040
Could there really be a ghost?

72
00:04:00,830 --> 00:04:01,790
Don't talk nonsense.

73
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:03,370
There's no such thing as ghosts in this world.

74
00:04:04,580 --> 00:04:05,370
Is it you?

75
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:07,250
Are you the one causing trouble here?

76
00:04:07,250 --> 00:04:10,200
I think some people have done too many bad things.

77
00:04:10,830 --> 00:04:11,950
That's why they're feeling guilty.

78
00:04:13,620 --> 00:04:14,410
Miss.

79
00:04:14,750 --> 00:04:17,000
If you want to admit your mistake, you don't need to go to such lengths.

80
00:04:17,330 --> 00:04:18,950
It's making me feel sick.

81
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:19,910
You—

82
00:04:22,580 --> 00:04:24,200
There's a ghost! A ghost!

83
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:25,910
Miss!

84
00:04:25,950 --> 00:04:27,750
Miss, don't leave me alone!

85
00:04:41,540 --> 00:04:42,750
Since you are so heartless to me,

86
00:04:43,750 --> 00:04:45,200
why bother helping me at all?

87
00:04:53,580 --> 00:04:54,950
Young Lord didn't rest well last night.

88
00:04:56,700 --> 00:04:58,250
He was up late handling official documents.

89
00:04:59,870 --> 00:05:01,580
I wonder why Teacher came here so early this morning.

90
00:05:01,660 --> 00:05:02,620
Is there something important?

91
00:05:07,540 --> 00:05:08,950
It's nothing important, really.

92
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:10,620
I just suddenly started to miss

93
00:05:10,620 --> 00:05:11,750
the pastries made by the young madam.

94
00:05:11,750 --> 00:05:12,870
I only realized after coming here.

95
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,500
The young madam went back to her family yesterday.

96
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:15,910
On my way here,

97
00:05:16,370 --> 00:05:17,790
I also heard something interesting.

98
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:20,040
What interesting thing?

99
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:22,000
I heard there was a haunting at Lord Lin's residence last night.

100
00:05:22,290 --> 00:05:23,870
It frightened the second Miss Lin quite a bit.

101
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:24,750
So,

102
00:05:24,750 --> 00:05:27,120
the second young master rushed over early this morning to check on her.

103
00:05:27,290 --> 00:05:28,410
Is that so?

104
00:05:28,450 --> 00:05:30,000
I heard that last night, the young madam

105
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:31,830
was with the second Miss Lin.

106
00:05:31,830 --> 00:05:34,660
Aren't you worried that the young madam

107
00:05:34,660 --> 00:05:35,870
was also frightened?

108
00:05:36,450 --> 00:05:37,290
Her?

109
00:05:38,750 --> 00:05:41,160
She probably just clapped and cheered from the side.

110
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:44,830
You really do know the young madam well.

111
00:05:46,910 --> 00:05:48,870
Since you can't bear to be apart from the young madam,

112
00:05:49,950 --> 00:05:51,700
why not try harder one more time?

113
00:05:52,370 --> 00:05:55,870
Maybe you can break the deadly fate.

114
00:05:59,410 --> 00:06:00,250
Teacher.

115
00:06:01,450 --> 00:06:02,750
As the high priest,

116
00:06:02,870 --> 00:06:03,950
you know the secrets of fate.

117
00:06:04,580 --> 00:06:06,250
You also helped me defy fate and change my destiny.

118
00:06:06,330 --> 00:06:08,450
You helped me plan the body-switching scheme for this life.

119
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:10,040
You understand better than anyone

120
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:12,000
what happened to Mingxuan and me.

121
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:14,660
It's not like I haven't tried.

122
00:06:16,370 --> 00:06:17,160
Or rather,

123
00:06:18,540 --> 00:06:20,160
in every lifetime with Mingxuan,

124
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:22,370
I've always tried my best.

125
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:23,950
But the ending...

126
00:06:23,950 --> 00:06:24,750
Mingxuan...

127
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:30,000
Mingxuan...

128
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:37,870
Mingxuan...

129
00:06:50,700 --> 00:06:51,950
I don't want to keep

130
00:06:51,950 --> 00:06:53,540
watching her die in front of me over and over.

131
00:06:56,620 --> 00:06:58,370
You are the calamity destined in her fate.

132
00:07:00,290 --> 00:07:01,290
I can't blame you for it.

133
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:03,790
But at least this time, something has changed.

134
00:07:05,830 --> 00:07:07,080
If that epidemic in Liucheng

135
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:08,200
was her fatal tribulation,

136
00:07:08,580 --> 00:07:09,290
does that mean

137
00:07:09,290 --> 00:07:10,910
I've already changed her fate?

138
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:13,290
What about you?

139
00:07:14,660 --> 00:07:16,500
You traded half your lifespan for her life,

140
00:07:17,790 --> 00:07:19,660
and even let her misunderstand that you don't like her.

141
00:07:21,410 --> 00:07:22,830
Is it really worth it?

142
00:07:28,580 --> 00:07:30,040
As long as she lives well,

143
00:07:32,700 --> 00:07:33,580
it's worth it.

144
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:47,830
Xiao Jingyang, oh Xiao Jingyang,

145
00:07:48,540 --> 00:07:50,200
two lifetimes have already passed,

146
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:53,160
why can't I still see through you?

147
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:55,950
Ming Xuan.

148
00:08:01,450 --> 00:08:02,160
Why are you here?

149
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:02,910
Let me see.

150
00:08:03,750 --> 00:08:04,500
Young Madam,

151
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:06,660
Little Hongtao is used to serving by your side.

152
00:08:06,660 --> 00:08:08,950
So she still wants to stay and take care of you.

153
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
But after all, you belong to the Young Lord's residence.

154
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:11,750
Don't worry.

155
00:08:11,750 --> 00:08:12,540
I brought her here.

156
00:08:12,540 --> 00:08:14,290
I'll handle things with the Young Lord.

157
00:08:18,790 --> 00:08:21,120
Are you here to bring Little Hongtao,

158
00:08:22,660 --> 00:08:24,750
or to deliver the divorce papers?

159
00:08:25,950 --> 00:08:27,200
Come, have a seat.

160
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:28,950
Well, I heard

161
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:31,700
that Lin Minghua made things difficult for you yesterday.

162
00:08:31,700 --> 00:08:32,910
So I rushed over.

163
00:08:33,330 --> 00:08:35,250
How dare she bully my friend.

164
00:08:35,580 --> 00:08:36,950
Does she really think you have no one behind you?

165
00:08:37,830 --> 00:08:40,370
So, are you here to help me fight?

166
00:08:40,750 --> 00:08:41,540
Not exactly.

167
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,160
On my way here,

168
00:08:43,160 --> 00:08:45,790
I saw Xiao Jingyu with a doctor

169
00:08:45,790 --> 00:08:48,500
hurrying into Lin Minghua's courtyard.

170
00:08:49,290 --> 00:08:51,330
They said she was scared sick.

171
00:08:51,660 --> 00:08:52,500
Was that your doing?

172
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,620
I don't have that kind of ability.

173
00:08:54,950 --> 00:08:55,750
I think

174
00:08:56,120 --> 00:08:58,200
she's just done too many guilty things.

175
00:09:07,910 --> 00:09:09,540
Isn't this the Young Lord's token?

176
00:09:11,910 --> 00:09:12,950
You two...

177
00:09:16,290 --> 00:09:17,620
Are you still mad at him?

178
00:09:18,870 --> 00:09:22,160
So even if the Young Lord dies from illness,

179
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:23,500
you wouldn't feel sorry for him?

180
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:26,200
How is he?

181
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:27,540
Did the poison act up again?

182
00:09:27,540 --> 00:09:28,870
You clearly care about him.

183
00:09:30,290 --> 00:09:31,750
Our fate is over.

184
00:09:32,370 --> 00:09:34,620
Don't joke with me like this in the future.

185
00:09:35,950 --> 00:09:37,500
But can you really let go?

186
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,790
