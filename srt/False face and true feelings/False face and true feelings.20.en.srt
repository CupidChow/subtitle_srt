[Episode 20]

3
00:00:43,430 --> 00:00:46,000
Your father
sent people to kill him before.

4
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:48,790
When?

5
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:51,710
Before he joined the Hong Gang.

6
00:00:51,710 --> 00:00:53,000
When he was in Yuncheng.

7
00:00:54,520 --> 00:00:55,320
Yuncheng...

8
00:00:58,350 --> 00:00:59,600
No wonder Mr. Liu

9
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:00,880
told me he was dead.

10
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:04,070
Did he kill my father

11
00:01:04,070 --> 00:01:06,000
because my father tried to kill him?

12
00:01:06,230 --> 00:01:07,480
Wasn't that reasonable?

13
00:01:07,950 --> 00:01:10,120
Yifan was just 11,

14
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:12,560
but your father told the bandits' boss

15
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:14,200
to hunt him in the whole Yuncheng.

16
00:01:14,480 --> 00:01:16,760
He barely survived.

17
00:01:17,950 --> 00:01:18,760
Gu Qingyan.

18
00:01:19,310 --> 00:01:20,640
You would do it more brutally

19
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:23,400
if you were in his shoes.

20
00:01:26,590 --> 00:01:27,400
All right.

21
00:01:27,790 --> 00:01:29,710
It's all that I can tell you.

22
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:30,510
As for the rest,

23
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,310
I'm sure you are smart enough

24
00:01:32,310 --> 00:01:33,680
to guess it.

25
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:35,640
Miss Su.

26
00:01:36,120 --> 00:01:37,680
Are you so frank with me

27
00:01:37,870 --> 00:01:39,120
because you don't hate me anymore?

28
00:01:40,760 --> 00:01:41,640
Gu Qingyan.

29
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:43,950
Quit fooling yourself.

32
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:49,200
but apparently,

33
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:52,000
you love him.

34
00:01:58,920 --> 00:01:59,950
Says who?

35
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:03,120
There is no love or hatred

36
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:04,840
in my heart,

37
00:02:06,790 --> 00:02:08,240
nothing.

38
00:02:37,150 --> 00:02:38,910
He does hide it here.

39
00:02:51,470 --> 00:02:52,840
To think his power in Rongcheng

40
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:54,710
is so strong.

41
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,360
Should I tell Annian?

42
00:03:02,870 --> 00:03:04,280
You will regret it

43
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:05,520
if you hurt him.

[17th November, Year of Gengwu]

45
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:35,750
The day after tomorrow is his birthday.

46
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:38,750
But it doesn't seem
like he's going to celebrate it.

47
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:40,590
Wait.

48
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:42,560
He just moved in less than a month ago,

49
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:45,590
how did he know this secret compartment?

50
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:55,800
I can take the next step

51
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:58,470
if I give it to Annian.

52
00:03:59,870 --> 00:04:00,800
Gu Qingyan,

53
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:03,800
why are you hesitating?

54
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:06,800
Young Lady.

55
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:08,360
Mr. Liu.

56
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:11,560
The first class for a killer

57
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:14,840
is to abandon all their emotions,

58
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:17,120
show no mercy to anyone,

59
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:19,160
and leave no way out for themselves.

60
00:04:19,950 --> 00:04:21,360
But I always fail to do it.

61
00:04:22,630 --> 00:04:23,950
Am I useless?

62
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:26,950
If you don't have the heart to do it,

63
00:04:27,390 --> 00:04:28,680
let me do it for you.

64
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:32,000
I have a conjecture,

65
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:33,950
but I dare not to think about it.

66
00:04:34,750 --> 00:04:36,680
I'm afraid I can't avenge my father.

67
00:04:37,390 --> 00:04:38,510
And I'm afraid that I'll regret it

68
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:40,680
if I do.

69
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:44,310
Since you want the answer,

70
00:04:44,750 --> 00:04:46,630
you may control his force

71
00:04:47,310 --> 00:04:48,430
and seize his weakness

72
00:04:49,310 --> 00:04:50,630
to gain the upper hand.

73
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:53,390
Then you may ask him about the truth.

74
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,510
Give this to Annian

75
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,600
and tell him to look
into the families on it.

76
00:05:07,630 --> 00:05:09,070
Where's the thing I told you to buy?

77
00:05:09,830 --> 00:05:10,800
I have bought it.

78
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:15,830
Why did you come?

79
00:05:16,750 --> 00:05:17,560
To see you.

80
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:19,480
Here.

81
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:22,040
Why?

82
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:23,510
Mr. Mo.

83
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:25,630
It's a birthday present for you.

84
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:31,190
You keep talking about killing people.

85
00:05:31,270 --> 00:05:32,750
That is too lifeless.

86
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:33,560
These creatures

87
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:34,680
may make your life a bit more lively

88
00:05:34,830 --> 00:05:36,480
and give you hope.

89
00:05:40,870 --> 00:05:41,800
You don't like them?

90
00:05:44,870 --> 00:05:45,680
I do.

91
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:46,950
Here.

92
00:05:48,430 --> 00:05:50,430
I have seen too many dead things,

93
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:52,040
so I'm not used

94
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:53,040
to seeing the living.

95
00:05:53,390 --> 00:05:54,190
I am

96
00:05:55,270 --> 00:05:57,160
giving them to you sincerely.

97
00:05:57,920 --> 00:05:59,680
Please keep them alive, Mr. Mo.

98
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:02,600
I will.

99
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:06,190
How do you know my birthday?

100
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:07,310
I...

101
00:06:09,510 --> 00:06:10,920
Miss Su told me.

102
00:06:13,390 --> 00:06:14,160
Qingyan.

103
00:06:15,270 --> 00:06:16,070
Thank you.

104
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,750
Since you have
found the secret compartment,

105
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:24,310
you will find out the truth one day.

106
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:27,310
No matter how hard I try,

107
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:30,510
there are things
that I can't keep from you forever.

108
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:33,000
Ye Yifan.

109
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:36,310
I wish you were not my enemy.

110
00:06:37,430 --> 00:06:38,390
So we wouldn't

111
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,800
have to stand against each other.

112
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:02,800
Mr. Mo.

113
00:07:07,390 --> 00:07:08,600
You came here

114
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:10,360
just to show me this?

115
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:13,270
I tried to persuade you,

116
00:07:13,270 --> 00:07:13,870
but you didn't listen.

117
00:07:13,870 --> 00:07:15,360
So I have to show you the proof.

118
00:07:15,750 --> 00:07:17,160
She has been scheming
with Shen Annian...

119
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:18,720
She wants to cooperate with Shen Annian

120
00:07:19,310 --> 00:07:20,800
to find out all my forces.

121
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:22,310
Shen Annian wants to use her

122
00:07:22,310 --> 00:07:23,160
to find the treasure map

123
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:24,270
and then get rid of me.

124
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:25,800
Is that your point?

125
00:07:25,870 --> 00:07:26,950
Why are you doing that

126
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:28,190
since you know it?

127
00:07:31,310 --> 00:07:32,510
She told Shen Annian

128
00:07:32,510 --> 00:07:33,800
about the deployment
of our entire forces.

129
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:34,720
Boss,

130
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:36,270
you will get killed

131
00:07:36,270 --> 00:07:37,750
because of that woman in this case.

132
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:42,000
What about Marshal Shen?

133
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:43,240
He is alarmed.

134
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:44,830
I think he wants to kill Shen Annian.

135
00:07:46,310 --> 00:07:48,120
Shen Annian won't be a sitting duck.

136
00:07:48,510 --> 00:07:50,560
He will try to kill me first.

137
00:07:57,510 --> 00:07:58,800
He has bought over the Wus.

138
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:00,160
What to do?

139
00:08:00,310 --> 00:08:01,430
Bury them alive.

140
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:12,160
