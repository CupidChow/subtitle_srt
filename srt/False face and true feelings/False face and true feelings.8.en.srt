[Episode 8]

3
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:45,350
Since it's my first visit here,

4
00:00:45,640 --> 00:00:47,840
I have prepared a good gift for Ms. Gu.

5
00:00:48,150 --> 00:00:49,350
I wonder if you will like it.

6
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:53,790
Lady.

7
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:00,520
Yifan.

8
00:01:03,880 --> 00:01:04,350
Take it away.

9
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:05,510
Ye Yifan,

10
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:06,680
what do you mean?

11
00:01:09,480 --> 00:01:10,790
Mr. Ye, why did you do that?

12
00:01:11,480 --> 00:01:12,840
So you forgot

13
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,230
that Master Luo's men

14
00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:16,680
tried to harass you

15
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:17,590
in the church,

16
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:19,400
I killed three for you

17
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:20,680
and kept one to send the message.

18
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,560
But since he laid his hand on you,

19
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:23,840
I took it.

20
00:01:29,070 --> 00:01:29,640
Ms. Gu,

21
00:01:30,710 --> 00:01:31,870
how do you

22
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:33,480
like my gift?

23
00:01:37,950 --> 00:01:39,680
I like your gift so much.

24
00:01:40,310 --> 00:01:41,920
I will return the favor

25
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:42,640
one day.

26
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:10,360
Why didn't I see you before?

27
00:02:10,910 --> 00:02:13,560
I used to study in France

28
00:02:13,630 --> 00:02:14,710
and I just came back.

29
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:16,080
I am going

30
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:17,470
to stay with Yifan

31
00:02:17,590 --> 00:02:18,400
and support him.

32
00:02:24,630 --> 00:02:26,310
Look at your tender, fair,

33
00:02:26,310 --> 00:02:27,400
and long fingers.

34
00:02:27,590 --> 00:02:29,030
You haven't killed anyone, have you?

35
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:30,490
Kill anyone?

36
00:02:31,150 --> 00:02:33,120
I didn't even kill an ant.

37
00:02:34,470 --> 00:02:36,120
Then how do you help Mr. Ye?

38
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:38,590
Play the piano when he kills?

39
00:02:38,910 --> 00:02:39,520
You...

40
00:02:42,590 --> 00:02:43,470
Did you

41
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:45,190
kill someone?

42
00:02:45,310 --> 00:02:45,870
I killed

43
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:47,120
more than one.

44
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:55,000
I lost my dad

45
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:56,470
in Yuncheng

46
00:02:57,080 --> 00:02:58,710
and was saved by an elder brother.

47
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:01,080
It was chaotic in Yuncheng.

48
00:03:01,430 --> 00:03:02,710
He almost got killed for saving me.

49
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:06,240
So I begged him to teach me to kill.

50
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:08,240
Elder brother, you saved me.

51
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:09,520
Please teach me how to kill.

52
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:10,870
I won't teach you that.

53
00:03:11,750 --> 00:03:12,960
Your hands should always

54
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:13,710
be clean.

55
00:03:17,310 --> 00:03:19,150
Then I heard he died.

56
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:20,800
I didn't believe it

57
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:22,400
because an old monk told me

58
00:03:22,590 --> 00:03:23,800
that we would meet again.

59
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:26,960
So I kept training harder.

60
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:28,560
I was thinking

61
00:03:29,750 --> 00:03:31,120
if we met again,

62
00:03:32,030 --> 00:03:33,360
not only he could protect me,

63
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:35,910
but I would be able
to keep him safe, too.

64
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:44,710
My hands are not meant to be clean.

65
00:03:56,590 --> 00:03:58,030
You are good at acting

66
00:03:58,400 --> 00:03:59,630
and using people.

67
00:03:59,960 --> 00:04:01,750
Who knows if you are speaking the truth?

68
00:04:02,910 --> 00:04:04,560
Why are you so sure
that there is no sincerity

69
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:05,750
in my words?

70
00:04:07,030 --> 00:04:08,870
You are not a gullible man.

71
00:04:10,870 --> 00:04:11,470
Ms. Gu.

72
00:04:12,870 --> 00:04:14,800
I came here on behalf of Mr. Mo

73
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:15,800
for one thing only.

74
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:18,360
Is Fair Shura here?

75
00:04:22,190 --> 00:04:23,600
If Mr. Mo wants to know it,

76
00:04:24,190 --> 00:04:25,160
let him come in person

77
00:04:25,630 --> 00:04:28,240
instead of hiding behind someone else.

78
00:04:30,510 --> 00:04:31,800
I almost forgot

79
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:34,040
your powerful friend,

80
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:35,070
the son of the marshal.

81
00:04:35,310 --> 00:04:36,330
Then why do you bother

82
00:04:36,330 --> 00:04:37,870
to let me kill Mr. Mo for you?

83
00:04:38,270 --> 00:04:38,800
What?

84
00:04:39,390 --> 00:04:40,040
He can't do that?

85
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:41,630
Ye Yifan,

86
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:43,680
call him here

87
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,310
to see if I can do that.

88
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:47,870
You?

89
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:52,360
You don't deserve it.

90
00:04:52,870 --> 00:04:53,390
You!

91
00:04:59,310 --> 00:05:01,390
Yifan, he is with a gun.

92
00:05:06,510 --> 00:05:08,310
So Ms. Su is so timid.

93
00:05:08,870 --> 00:05:09,950
You love a woman like her?

94
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:12,390
Should he love you?

95
00:05:13,190 --> 00:05:14,510
Master Meng told me

96
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:15,480
that you

97
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:17,040
became a dancer of New Metropolitan

98
00:05:17,390 --> 00:05:19,190
to seduce Yifan.

99
00:05:19,830 --> 00:05:20,680
But

100
00:05:20,830 --> 00:05:22,680
he didn't bite the hook.

102

Did your Yifan

103
00:05:30,310 --> 00:05:31,240
kiss you before?

104
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:34,520

105
00:05:35,510 --> 00:05:36,630
What do you mean?

106
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:39,480
So he didn't.

107
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:41,240
But he kissed me.

108

00:05:45,390 --> 00:05:46,480
I have never seen a woman

110
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:47,830
so brazen like you.

111
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:49,120
Now you have.

112
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:49,830

114
00:06:09,310 --> 00:06:10,240
I was just going

115
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:12,240
to propose a toast to Ms. Su.

116
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:15,950
Wanyin never drinks.

117
00:06:16,510 --> 00:06:17,560
Let me drink it for her.

118

119

120
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:41,680
it's pointless to have this dinner.

Qingyan.

122
00:06:57,720 --> 00:06:58,870
You just let him go?

123
00:07:06,390 --> 00:07:07,310
Yifan.

124
00:07:07,630 --> 00:07:09,160
Tell me.

125
00:07:09,260 --> 00:07:10,280

Come on.

130
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:18,830
You are covering her.

to me before,

133
00:07:21,270 --> 00:07:22,680
you would have cut off his hand.

134
00:07:22,830 --> 00:07:23,520

Yes.

141

Then

142
