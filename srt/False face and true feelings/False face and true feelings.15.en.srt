What do you want?

6
00:00:54,750 --> 00:00:55,640
Gu Qingyan.

7
00:00:55,750 --> 00:00:56,710
Quit pretending.

8
00:00:56,790 --> 00:00:58,470
You didn't lose your memories, did you?

9
00:01:03,240 --> 00:01:04,310
I will kill you

10
00:01:04,310 --> 00:01:05,480
if you lie to me.

11
00:01:10,870 --> 00:01:12,230
Mr. Mo, help me.

12
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:15,590
Yifan, I...

13
00:01:18,760 --> 00:01:19,560
Mr. Liu.

14
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:23,040
Walk her back to her room.

15
00:01:24,430 --> 00:01:25,150
Yifan.

16
00:01:25,150 --> 00:01:26,150
- Go.
- You can't trust her.

17
00:01:26,150 --> 00:01:26,790
She is deceiving you.

18
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:28,150
She is pretending to be amnesiac.

19
00:01:28,350 --> 00:01:29,280
Yifan.

20
00:01:31,120 --> 00:01:32,870
Young Lady, shall we?

21
00:01:37,120 --> 00:01:37,920
Mr. Liu.

22
00:01:38,710 --> 00:01:39,680
You don't have to be so cautious

23
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:41,040
when there is nobody else around.

24
00:01:42,590 --> 00:01:43,590
Remember,

25
00:01:44,430 --> 00:01:46,000
you are the butler of the Gus,

26
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:48,200
not Mr. Mo's.

27
00:01:48,510 --> 00:01:49,310
Young Lady.

28
00:01:49,480 --> 00:01:50,480
You didn't lose your memories?

29
00:02:02,070 --> 00:02:04,000
Yifan, you really believe her?

30
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,510
She didn't get shot in the head,

31
00:02:05,510 --> 00:02:06,350
so how could she

32
00:02:06,350 --> 00:02:07,950

Su Wanyin.

34
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:10,310
You should thank your dad

35
00:02:10,310 --> 00:02:11,190
for being able

36
00:02:11,190 --> 00:02:12,750
to stand here in one piece

37
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,400
after telling her my true identity.

38
00:02:16,430 --> 00:02:17,280
Yifan.

39
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:19,840
My dad didn't give you the Hong Gang

40
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:20,520
for you

41
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:22,150
to be deceived by that woman.

42
00:02:23,310 --> 00:02:24,960
You must have been bewitched.

43
00:02:26,590 --> 00:02:28,280
I will kill that woman.

44
00:02:30,710 --> 00:02:31,750
I'm warning you

45
00:02:32,030 --> 00:02:33,680
that I don't mind

46
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,360
ruining my agreement
with your dad if you do it again.

47
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:46,000
You know it, right?

48
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:49,120
You know she is deceiving you

49
00:02:49,150 --> 00:02:50,710
and faking her amnesia,

50
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:52,310
right?

51

Yifan,

52
00:02:55,870 --> 00:02:57,280
isn't your protection of her

53
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:00,710
a betrayal to your late parents?

54
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:04,470

She will leave in a couple of days.

59
00:03:13,870 --> 00:03:14,680
Yes.

How could you drive me away

63
00:03:18,190 --> 00:03:19,710

64
00:03:40,710 --> 00:03:41,910
How did he

65
00:03:42,870 --> 00:03:44,430
deal with my dad's body?

66
00:03:46,030 --> 00:03:47,190
He burnt it

67
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:49,000
and buried him in the same tomb.

68
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:54,470
Young Lady.

69
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:56,030

71
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:00,590
Kill him?

72
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:02,910
It's not enough.

73
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:08,280
I will destroy everything he has

74
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:10,590
and make him a nobody

75
00:04:11,470 --> 00:04:12,960
who has nothing.

76
00:04:18,750 --> 00:04:19,560
By the way,

77
00:04:20,270 --> 00:04:21,830
Mr. Shen came to see you today.

78
00:04:23,830 --> 00:04:24,680
Annian?

79
00:04:25,870 --> 00:04:26,800
Is he alright?

80
00:04:27,190 --> 00:04:28,120
You said

81
00:04:28,310 --> 00:04:29,000
that his men

82
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,430
were subdued by Ye Yifan.

83
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:33,310
They were killed.

84
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:41,720
He is brutal enough.

85
00:04:43,390 --> 00:04:45,000
Send a message to Annian

86
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:46,560
that I want to see him.

87
00:04:47,430 --> 00:04:48,920
I will wipe out Mr. Mo

88
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:50,800
and the whole Hong Gang

89
00:04:51,390 --> 00:04:53,510
from Rongcheng.

90
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:12,070
Son, you're back.

91
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:16,040
Young master, easy.

92
00:05:16,270 --> 00:05:17,310
I have

93
00:05:17,310 --> 00:05:18,800
made your favorite osmanthus cake.

94
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:24,070
My leg was hurt by Mrs. Mo

95
00:05:24,070 --> 00:05:25,360
when I killed her.

96
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:28,190
You can't kill me.

97
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:29,390
Qingyan needs me.

98
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:31,310
I'm the only one she has in this world.

99
00:05:31,750 --> 00:05:32,560
Dad.

100
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:36,360
Dad!

101

Dad.

102
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:40,190
Father.

103
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:41,510
Mother.

104
00:05:42,390 --> 00:05:44,360
Was I wrong?

105
00:05:44,950 --> 00:05:46,310
I killed our enemy

106
00:05:47,190 --> 00:05:48,920
and got our home back

107
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:50,190
after 15 years,

108
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:51,720
but I...

109
00:05:52,830 --> 00:05:55,000
I have become a man like him.

110
00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:57,310
I have made my cherished girl

111
00:05:57,310 --> 00:05:59,480
suffer the same agony as I had.

112
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:02,270
Even if he deserved to die,

113
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:05,510
I couldn't forgive myself.

114
00:06:10,510 --> 00:06:11,310
Mr. Mo.

115
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:29,560
What's on your mind?

116
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:44,800
Qingyan.

117
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:47,360
You don't have to stand on ceremony.

118
00:06:49,870 --> 00:06:50,680
Mr. Mo.

119
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:53,430
Aren't the others doing the same thing?

120
00:06:53,950 --> 00:06:55,240
You are not like them.

121
00:06:56,510 --> 00:06:57,600
You may do anything

122
00:06:58,480 --> 00:07:00,190
you like to me.

123
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:12,360
All right then,

124
00:07:13,510 --> 00:07:15,070
could I make a request?

125
00:07:19,390 --> 00:07:20,720
Make any request

126
