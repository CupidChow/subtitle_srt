Annian.

5
00:00:59,240 --> 00:01:00,840
Meng Huaizuo used to be Ye Yifan's man.

6
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:02,110
Yet you chose to trust him.

7
00:01:02,560 --> 00:01:03,670
We've been friends for over a decade,

8
00:01:03,670 --> 00:01:04,710
but you suspect me.

9
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:06,480
Qingyan.

10
00:01:08,590 --> 00:01:09,950
I'm not suspecting you.

11

I'm suspecting you

Yes.

Tonight.

19
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:45,000
Are you regretful

20
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,510
to send the wrong message to Ye Yifan?

21
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:49,280
You set a trap

22
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:51,040
by giving me a fake message?

23
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:52,400
Qingyan.

24
00:01:52,790 --> 00:01:54,680
My rule of survival since my childhood

25
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:56,480
is to trust nobody.

26
00:01:57,310 --> 00:01:59,350
You know why I keep you with me?

27
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:01,870
Because you are his only concern.

28
00:02:02,350 --> 00:02:03,680
So you will

29
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:05,350
be my largest chip.

30
00:02:06,070 --> 00:02:08,080
Shouldn't I thank Ye Yifan

31
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:09,150
for giving me

32
00:02:09,150 --> 00:02:11,280
such a good hostage?

33
00:02:11,710 --> 00:02:13,280
Shen Annian, shame on you.

34
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,080
Shame?

35
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:17,360
Is Ye Yifan any better?

36
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:20,120
How many schemes do you think

37
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:22,030
he has used to climb to such a position

38
00:02:22,030 --> 00:02:24,120
from a killer on the street?

39
00:02:26,590 --> 00:02:27,590
He is more cold-blooded,

40
00:02:27,590 --> 00:02:28,910
ruthless, and shameless.

41
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:30,150
Why should you

42
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:31,360
love such a man?

43

We all do things unscrupulously
to get what we want.

44
00:02:34,310 --> 00:02:35,710
Why is he

45
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:36,870
a kind man to you

46
00:02:36,870 --> 00:02:38,400
and I am a heinous one?

47
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:39,910
Is that fair?

48
00:02:40,870 --> 00:02:42,870
Ye Yifan never killed innocent people.

49
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:44,520
At least, he wouldn't hurt his family

50
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:46,000
to seize power.

51
00:02:46,310 --> 00:02:48,800
Shen Annian, you're in no place
to judge him

52
00:02:48,870 --> 00:02:50,680
since you killed your own father.

53
00:02:50,910 --> 00:02:52,870
Do you think you can

54
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:54,520
keep him alive just by yourself?

55
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:57,000
I can die with him at the worst.

56
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:02,360
Does he have that heart?

57
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:05,840
Just stay put and wait

58
00:03:06,030 --> 00:03:07,750
for my good news tonight.

59
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:17,680
Still no news of Mr. Liu?

to look for him.

62

But he seems to have vanished.

63
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:21,710
Sir,

64
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:23,430
did Shen Annian kill him?

65
00:03:27,030 --> 00:03:28,470
What did the Shens do today?

66
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:29,710
Shen Annian left his home

67
00:03:29,710 --> 00:03:31,080
with some people.

68
00:03:31,470 --> 00:03:32,710

69

Tell everyone

that Shen Annian may do it earlier.

73
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:54,000
Why are you here?

74
00:03:54,870 --> 00:03:56,280
I gave Mr. Mo the word

75
00:03:56,310 --> 00:03:57,680
that I would keep you intact.

76
00:03:57,680 --> 00:03:59,470
So I have to stay with you.

77
00:04:00,870 --> 00:04:02,470
This is the way you protect me?

78
00:04:04,750 --> 00:04:06,470
Miss Gu, take it easy.

79
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:08,150
Shen Annian is no match for us.

80
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:10,360
Mr. Mo has arranged for everything.

81
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:11,190
Once he takes action,

82
00:04:11,190 --> 00:04:12,280
he will be in our trap.

83
00:04:12,870 --> 00:04:13,440
Look,

84
00:04:13,750 --> 00:04:14,400
if Mr. Mo doesn't come

85
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:15,400
within four hours,

86
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:16,120
I will get you out of here.

87
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:17,240
No.

88
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:18,800
You're not here to protect me.

89
00:04:19,070 --> 00:04:21,040
He sent you here
to keep an eye on me, right?

90
00:04:22,750 --> 00:04:23,830
He doesn't want me to be in danger.

91
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:25,360
Miss Gu.

92
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:27,000
I know you want to go to help Mr. Mo.

93
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:28,720
But I think

94
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:30,190
you will help him greatly

95
00:04:30,190 --> 00:04:31,720
if you don't go to disturb him.

96
00:04:37,870 --> 00:04:39,270
I am feeling uneasy.

97
00:04:39,510 --> 00:04:40,750
Something doesn't seem right.

98
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:42,390
Why did Shen Annian

99
00:04:42,390 --> 00:04:43,920
look so confident?

100
00:04:44,070 --> 00:04:45,870
Because he is an arrogant man

101
00:04:45,870 --> 00:04:47,600
who has overestimated himself.

102
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:48,310
No.

103
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:49,870
I'm sure he has something up his sleeve.

Mr. Mo.

107
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:22,560
Didn't you

108
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:23,560
go to attack my men?

109
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:26,000
What brings you here?

110
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:27,480
Ye Yifan.

111
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:29,360
Those families betrayed me

112
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:30,720
because of your order.

113
00:05:32,510 --> 00:05:34,360
You told them to join me

114
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:36,680
and then give me a fatal blow.

115
00:05:37,270 --> 00:05:38,750
You are not too dumb

116
00:05:39,310 --> 00:05:40,430
since you could get here.

117
00:05:40,750 --> 00:05:42,510
So you know

118
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:45,390
all my plans.

119
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:52,870
Ye Yifan.

121
00:05:54,730 --> 00:05:55,920
I have lost already?

122

124

But it's time

126
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:07,750
Our accounts?

127
00:06:09,870 --> 00:06:11,040
Is there any grudge

128

129
00:06:15,270 --> 00:06:16,070
No.

130
00:06:16,830 --> 00:06:18,360

131

of your enemy,

132

my father.

133
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:21,310
So you should

134
00:06:21,310 --> 00:06:22,430
thank me for that.

was you.

138

Yes.

139
00:06:33,270 --> 00:06:34,190
It was me.

140
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:39,430
But I didn't think too much.

141

All I wanted

142
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:46,720
was to gain my father's favor.

143

But I was wrong
