[Episode 19]

3
00:00:44,710 --> 00:00:46,320
Shen Annian found the Lins.

4
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:48,710
Tell someone to inform Marshal Shen

5
00:00:48,710 --> 00:00:49,750
that Shen Annian plans to replace him.

6
00:00:50,240 --> 00:00:51,350
Why do you do that?

7
00:00:55,750 --> 00:00:58,030
It was Marshal Shen
who ordered Gu Tingwei

8
00:00:58,520 --> 00:01:00,070
to kill my whole family.

9
00:01:01,240 --> 00:01:03,560
So I have to make him
pay for it sooner or later.

10
00:01:06,430 --> 00:01:08,400
Marshal Shen values his status the most.

11
00:01:08,870 --> 00:01:10,070
So if he knows

12
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:11,950
his youngest son is so ambitious,

13
00:01:12,430 --> 00:01:14,120
he won't spare him.

14
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:16,230
Let them fight first.

15
00:01:16,480 --> 00:01:17,560
When both sides are weakened,

16
00:01:17,710 --> 00:01:18,950
we will take action.

17
00:01:21,590 --> 00:01:22,640
I'll make the arrangements now.

18
00:01:26,230 --> 00:01:27,040
Qingyan.

19
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:28,870
Did you blame me, so you refused

20
00:01:29,590 --> 00:01:30,680
to see me for so many days?

21
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:32,640
Annian.

22
00:01:33,310 --> 00:01:34,280
You want him dead

23
00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:35,310
so eagerly?

24
00:01:36,510 --> 00:01:37,310
If he dies,

25
00:01:37,310 --> 00:01:38,840
my plan will be jeopardized.

26
00:01:39,350 --> 00:01:40,120
He is the most unstable factor

27
00:01:40,120 --> 00:01:41,510
in the plan.

28
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:43,950
His forces in Rongcheng
are deeply concealed.

29
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,710
We can't find them after so long.

30
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:46,790
He is more complicated

31
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:48,150
than we thought.

32
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:50,640
So you changed the medicine stealthily?

33
00:01:51,070 --> 00:01:52,840
Ye Yifan can not die now.

34
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:53,640
I have many things

35
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:54,350
to figure out.

36
00:01:54,350 --> 00:01:55,040
Qingyan.

37
00:01:55,310 --> 00:01:56,920
Are you deceiving yourself?

38
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:00,510
It's my father who was killed,

39
00:02:01,070 --> 00:02:02,640
so I know what to do.

40
00:02:02,710 --> 00:02:03,840
Likewise.

41
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:06,000
I also know what to do.

42
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:09,000
I just hope you won't hinder me

43
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:10,840
when I take action.

44
00:02:13,030 --> 00:02:14,150
What will you do?

45
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:53,400
What is

46
00:02:54,710 --> 00:02:55,590
in that room?

47
00:03:07,750 --> 00:03:08,590
Mr. Mo.

48
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:10,870
It's you.

49
00:03:12,310 --> 00:03:13,560
You may tell me

50
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:15,400
that you want to enter it

51
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:17,360
instead of doing it stealthily.

52
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:34,310
You may go in.

53
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:42,400
What are those things?

54
00:03:42,910 --> 00:03:44,150
The memorial tablets of my parents.

55
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:46,910
I thought...

56
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:48,870
There were some secrets

57
00:03:48,870 --> 00:03:50,520
that couldn't be exposed?

58
00:03:57,190 --> 00:03:59,310
He told me his family was wiped out.

59
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,520
So it was true.

60
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:04,430
But if I ask him about it,

61
00:04:04,750 --> 00:04:06,590
he will know I'm not amnesic.

62
00:04:09,150 --> 00:04:11,000
I feared my father so much
when I was a boy

63
00:04:11,470 --> 00:04:13,360
because he forced me to study every day

64
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:15,030
and was strict with me.

65
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:18,270
So I thought

66
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:21,310
it would be great
if he couldn't come back one day.

67
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:22,720
Then one day,

68
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:24,680
a man broke into my home

69
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:25,720
and killed him.

70
00:04:27,190 --> 00:04:28,750
So he could never come back.

71
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:50,940
My father was kind to me, too.

72
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:57,600
Mr. Liu told me

73
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:58,750
many things about him,

74
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:00,390
but I couldn't remember them.

75
00:05:02,270 --> 00:05:03,160
Your mother?

76
00:05:03,390 --> 00:05:04,830
Was she kind to you?

77
00:05:06,510 --> 00:05:07,310
My mother?

78
00:05:10,830 --> 00:05:12,440
She was a very gentle person.

[Memorial tablets]

80
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:14,160
She was timid

81
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:15,720
and weak.

82
00:05:16,950 --> 00:05:18,390
But

83
00:05:18,390 --> 00:05:19,800
when that man barged in,

84
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:21,430
she caught that man tightly

85
00:05:22,270 --> 00:05:24,240
to protect me.

86
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:31,510
It's been 15 years.

87
00:05:31,950 --> 00:05:33,040
Nobody remembers them

88
00:05:33,310 --> 00:05:34,510
except me.

89
00:05:38,190 --> 00:05:39,160
I've got something for you.

90
00:06:09,750 --> 00:06:10,680
This is?

91
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:12,750
It fits you well.

92
00:06:19,870 --> 00:06:21,720
I swear in front of my father

93
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:22,680
and mother

94
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:26,120
that I will always care for you.

95
00:06:30,390 --> 00:06:33,870
If I can make it up to you in this way...

96
00:06:38,310 --> 00:06:39,120
I...

97
00:06:41,070 --> 00:06:42,630
I shall no longer disturb you.

It was also the time

100
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:02,990
my father acquired the Fair Shura
and brought me here.

101
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:05,390
If the family of your love

102
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:07,240
hurts yours,

Gu Qingyan.

105
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:12,950
Yifan did hurt you,

106
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:14,190
but your father

107
00:07:14,190 --> 00:07:15,630
wasn't an innocent person.

108
00:07:18,270 --> 00:07:19,040
Yes.

109

110
00:07:27,390 --> 00:07:28,160

No way.

112
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:31,750
My father wouldn't do that.

113
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:33,360
His leg was wounded

114
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:34,360
and he couldn't kill anyone.

115
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,800
Besides, he had no money
to hire a killer at that time.

116
00:07:36,950 --> 00:07:37,750
Gu Qingyan.

117
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:39,390
You are thinking too much.

118
00:07:39,830 --> 00:07:41,000
It was impossible.

Why did you come here?

122
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:56,920
That's my question.

123
00:07:57,310 --> 00:07:59,190
I remember you are still grounded.

I'm hungry.

Can't I come out to grab a bite?

127

If you don't mind,

128
00:08:07,630 --> 00:08:08,430
come with me.

Let me get you some food.

130
00:08:18,190 --> 00:08:19,000
Eat.

131
00:08:20,310 --> 00:08:21,120
No.

132
00:08:21,390 --> 00:08:23,600
Who knows if you have poisoned it?

133
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:25,560
Miss Su.

134
00:08:25,950 --> 00:08:27,160
Do I have to use poison

135
00:08:27,510 --> 00:08:28,720
to kill you?

136
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:41,390
Miss Su.

137
00:08:42,550 --> 00:08:43,630
You said

138
00:08:44,270 --> 00:08:45,510
that my father wasn't innocent.

139
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:48,030
Do you know what he did before?

140
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:52,720
You're not pretending

141
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:54,000
to be amnesiac anymore?

142
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:57,870
Go ahead and tell Yifan.

143
00:08:58,030 --> 00:08:58,910
See if he trusts you

144
00:08:58,910 --> 00:08:59,840
or me.

145
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:01,670
By the way, tell him

146
00:09:01,670 --> 00:09:02,390
you sneaked out.

147
00:09:02,790 --> 00:09:04,240

149
00:09:06,510 --> 00:09:08,480
I don't understand why Yifan loves you?

150
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:10,600
You are such a selfish

151
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:11,750
and malicious woman.

152
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:13,510
Maybe

153
00:09:13,750 --> 00:09:14,550
it's just

154
00:09:14,550 --> 00:09:16,440
because I'm selfish
and malicious like him.

155
00:09:16,670 --> 00:09:18,480
He's not such a man.

156
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:24,240
I can't tell you just like that

157
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:26,550
because Yifan said

158
00:09:26,910 --> 00:09:27,960
he would kill anyone

159
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:29,360
who told you.

160
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:30,670
He means it

161
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:33,080
and it's not worthwhile to die for you.

162
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:35,390
Unless

163
00:09:38,150 --> 00:09:40,790
you can persuade him

164
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,510
not to send me abroad.

165
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:46,240
OK.

166
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:47,510
Really?

167
00:09:52,390 --> 00:09:53,200
Your father

168
