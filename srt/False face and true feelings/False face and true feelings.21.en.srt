00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:32,350
Mr. Mo?

4
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:34,870
What brings your here?

5
00:01:35,480 --> 00:01:36,310
Have you been

6
00:01:36,310 --> 00:01:37,790
seeing Shen Annian?

7
00:01:38,430 --> 00:01:38,920
I...

8
00:01:39,510 --> 00:01:40,310
I...

9
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:42,950
Like I said, Qingyan,

10
00:01:43,510 --> 00:01:45,560
you can do anything you want here,

11
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:47,510
but Shen Annian can't.

12
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:49,350
Mr. Mo.

13
00:01:50,150 --> 00:01:51,000
You are drunk.

14
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:51,640
Yes.

15
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:54,200
I am drunk.

16
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:56,590
So I no longer want to lie to myself.

17
00:01:57,560 --> 00:01:58,710
I don't want to see you

18
00:01:58,710 --> 00:01:59,790
performing in front of me

19
00:01:59,790 --> 00:02:01,350
with your hatred inside.

20
00:02:07,230 --> 00:02:08,120
You know it?

21
00:02:15,030 --> 00:02:16,910
You knew it in the first place, right?

22
00:02:17,590 --> 00:02:18,960
You knew I drugged you,

23
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:20,080
contacted Shen Annian,

24
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:20,960
investigated you,

25
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:22,280
and wanted to ruin your everything.

26
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:23,360
You knew it all?

27
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:24,310
Yes.

28
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:25,960
I knew it the moment

29
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:27,240
you woke up.

30
00:02:28,870 --> 00:02:29,910
Why?

31
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:31,910
Why did you

32
00:02:31,910 --> 00:02:33,120
step into my trap willingly

33
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:34,430
when you knew it?

34
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:35,870
Did you think

35
00:02:35,870 --> 00:02:37,910
you could be forgiven

36
00:02:37,910 --> 00:02:38,960
and make up for killing my father

37
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:39,680
by buckling

38
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:40,960
and being deceived by me?

39
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:43,080
I never expect your forgiveness.

40
00:02:46,430 --> 00:02:47,150
Qingyan.

41
00:02:48,470 --> 00:02:50,030
I don't know how to make it up to you.

42
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:53,870
Nobody has ever cared about me.

43
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:57,310
So I don't know
how to care about others.

44
00:02:59,430 --> 00:03:00,590
I just know

45
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,080
I will do all I can to care for you.

46
00:03:09,870 --> 00:03:10,910
I thought

47
00:03:12,590 --> 00:03:13,430
I could accept

48
00:03:13,430 --> 00:03:15,150
anything you did to me.

49
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:16,520
But I can't accept

50
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:17,590
that you keep seeking help

51
00:03:17,590 --> 00:03:18,910
from Shen Annian.

52
00:03:19,190 --> 00:03:20,710
You are my woman.

53
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:24,030
So I won't let you turn to another man.

54
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:28,590
What do you want me to do?

55
00:03:29,310 --> 00:03:30,030
To assume nothing happened

56
00:03:30,030 --> 00:03:31,910

57
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:35,240
I didn't turn to another man.

58
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:36,910
You know it clearly.

59
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:38,310
I would have left

60
00:03:38,310 --> 00:03:39,750

61

Tell him to do nothing.

92
