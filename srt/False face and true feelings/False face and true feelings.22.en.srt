[Episode 22]

3
00:00:48,750 --> 00:00:49,560
Come with me.

4
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:50,920
Don't let Mr. Mo see us,

5
00:00:50,920 --> 00:00:51,880
then you will be safe.

6
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:55,520
What if I refuse?

7
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:57,640
Then I will show no mercy.

8
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:02,000
Mr. Mo?

9
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:03,960
Meng Huaizuo, you want to die?

10
00:01:06,350 --> 00:01:07,150
Mr. Mo.

11
00:01:07,150 --> 00:01:07,950
He didn't mean it.

12
00:01:07,950 --> 00:01:09,000
Let him go.

13
00:01:13,120 --> 00:01:13,920
Take him away.

14
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:25,280
You okay?

15
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:34,040
You even shot your man.

16
00:01:34,430 --> 00:01:35,870
I'm impressed.

17
00:01:36,760 --> 00:01:37,790
It's dangerous here.

18
00:01:38,230 --> 00:01:39,120
You'd better go.

19
00:01:40,350 --> 00:01:41,870
Are you dealing with Shen Annian

20
00:01:41,870 --> 00:01:43,150
with Marshal Shen?

21
00:01:47,150 --> 00:01:47,790
Yes.

22
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:49,590
You had made such a plan

23
00:01:49,590 --> 00:01:51,200
before you came to see me yesterday.

24
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:55,150
What's your point?

25
00:01:55,590 --> 00:01:56,400
Was your plan

26
00:01:57,120 --> 00:01:58,230
to make me go soft on you

27
00:01:58,230 --> 00:01:59,950
so I'd tell Shen Annian to stop?

28
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,230
Then you would take him by surprise.

29
00:02:01,230 --> 00:02:02,400
You used me.

30
00:02:04,230 --> 00:02:05,640
That's how you think of me?

31
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:06,950
Why don't you think

32
00:02:06,950 --> 00:02:08,000
it's Shen Annian who is using you?

33
00:02:08,310 --> 00:02:10,030
Annian isn't such a man.

34
00:02:10,030 --> 00:02:11,000
So you choose to trust him

35
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,360
instead of me?

36
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:13,120
Yes.

37
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:13,960
Ye Yifan.

38
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:16,360
Because you never tell me the truth.

39
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:18,430
I regret what happened last night

40
00:02:18,430 --> 00:02:19,750
so much.

41
00:02:21,470 --> 00:02:22,360
What did you say?

42
00:02:22,710 --> 00:02:24,590
You always say you care about me

43
00:02:24,590 --> 00:02:25,630
and cherish me,

44
00:02:25,710 --> 00:02:26,800
but I know nothing

45
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:27,960
about you.

46
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:28,750
What sets me apart

47
00:02:28,750 --> 00:02:29,630
from the others

48
00:02:29,630 --> 00:02:30,960
in your eyes?

49
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:32,560
Even Song Manlin and Su Wanyin

50
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:33,680
know more about you than I do.

51
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:36,960
Ye Yifan, what on earth do you want?

52
00:02:37,590 --> 00:02:39,400
I want to see you suffer no more.

53
00:02:39,430 --> 00:02:40,800
I want you to move on with your life.

54
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:42,750
But I'm suffering so much right now.

55
00:02:50,190 --> 00:02:51,120
Qingyan.

56
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:53,470
Listen to me.

57
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:55,080
I want to hear nothing.

58
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:56,560
All right. Let me explain it.

59
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:58,150
Look out!

60
00:03:01,710 --> 00:03:02,520
Ye Yifan.

61
00:03:02,910 --> 00:03:03,590
Go.

62
00:03:03,590 --> 00:03:04,910
No. What about you?

63
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:06,710
Just go. Don't worry about me.

64
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:15,590
Ye Yifan.

65
00:03:16,630 --> 00:03:17,280
Ye Yifan.

66
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:26,470
Manlin.

67
00:03:26,710 --> 00:03:27,590
- Send for Dr. Zhang.
- Okay.

68
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:28,750
Ye Yifan.

69
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:30,080
Don't die.

70
00:03:30,190 --> 00:03:31,310
Don't you die.

71
00:03:31,310 --> 00:03:33,000
Stay with me, Ye Yifan.

72
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:35,030
Ye Yifan.

73
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:37,120
Don't sleep, Ye Yifan.

74
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:43,120
You said you shot someone?

75
00:03:43,150 --> 00:03:43,680
Yes.

76
00:03:43,910 --> 00:03:44,630
Who?

77
00:03:44,750 --> 00:03:45,520
It was too far away

78
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:46,310
to confirm it.

79
00:03:46,470 --> 00:03:47,840
But it shouldn't be Miss Gu

80
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:49,190
because Ye Yifan was protecting her.

81
00:03:49,430 --> 00:03:50,680
You can't confirm it?

82
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:53,870
Why do you need your eyes then?

83
00:03:54,590 --> 00:03:55,960
Go check it out.

84
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:56,710
Yes.

85
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:08,630
How is Mr. Mo?

86
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:10,520
Dr. Zhang is treating him inside.

87
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:11,870
Okay.

88
00:04:13,630 --> 00:04:14,910
- It's all your fault.
- Mr. Meng.

89
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:16,000
Calm down.

90
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,160
How can I calm down?

91
00:04:17,390 --> 00:04:18,680
How could Mr. Mo

92
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:20,160
not be able to dodge a bullet?

93
00:04:20,270 --> 00:04:21,270
It was because of her.

94
00:04:25,750 --> 00:04:27,430
Gu Qingyan, listen up.

95
00:04:28,390 --> 00:04:29,310
Everything that happened tonight

96
00:04:29,310 --> 00:04:30,800
was plotted by Shen Annian.

97
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:31,950
You were used by him.

98
00:04:32,870 --> 00:04:33,680
What?

99
00:04:34,310 --> 00:04:36,240
Shen Annian got close to you

100
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:37,600
because he wanted

101
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:39,310
the treasure map in the Fair Shura.

102
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:41,070
Then he got

103
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:43,600
to know all the forces

104
00:04:44,310 --> 00:04:45,240
deployed by Mr. Mo

105
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:46,680
through you.

106
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:48,510
We would have been wiped out

107
00:04:49,510 --> 00:04:51,830
if Mr. Mo hadn't prepared for it.

108
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:54,600
I...

109
00:04:55,070 --> 00:04:56,120
I just...

110
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:58,310
Just wanted to avenge your father?

111
00:04:58,830 --> 00:04:59,680
Miss Gu.

112
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:02,390
Since you risked your life to save him,

113
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:03,360
you should have

114
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:04,600
known the truth.

115
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:06,390
Why are you still fooling yourself?

116
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:11,240
Yes.

117
00:05:11,870 --> 00:05:12,870
I guessed it.

118
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:15,070
I guessed it long ago.

119
00:05:17,390 --> 00:05:19,310
The facts were right in front of me,

120
00:05:19,630 --> 00:05:21,480
but I was reluctant to believe them.

121
00:05:22,390 --> 00:05:24,430
I kept blinding myself with hatred.

122
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:27,480
But it's time to face the reality.

123
00:05:28,510 --> 00:05:29,600
Fifteen years ago,

124
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,800
my father killed his entire family

125
00:05:32,270 --> 00:05:33,800
and took the Fair Shura away,

126
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:34,950
right?

127
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:41,750
The mansion

128
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:44,510
belonged to the Mos.

129
00:05:46,430 --> 00:05:47,240
Failed?

130
00:05:47,510 --> 00:05:48,480
How could you fail?

131
00:05:48,630 --> 00:05:49,720
Why did his deployment

132
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:51,000
change abruptly?

133
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:52,000
I have no idea.

134
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:53,800
We had them under control at first.

135
00:05:53,870 --> 00:05:55,070
Then we were ambushed.

136
00:05:55,390 --> 00:05:56,240
Some places

137
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:58,630
were empty when we got there.

138
00:05:59,750 --> 00:06:01,120
Our casualties?

139
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:02,630
About 30%.

140
00:06:04,630 --> 00:06:06,000
Tell our men

141
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:08,160
not to take action rashly.

142
00:06:08,390 --> 00:06:09,190
Yes.

143
00:06:10,870 --> 00:06:12,390
Who got shot last night?

144
00:06:12,750 --> 00:06:13,630
Mr. Mo.

145
00:06:17,630 --> 00:06:19,240
All the deeds, documents,

146
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:21,240
and contracts, seals

147
00:06:21,310 --> 00:06:22,870
and keys of the Gus

148
00:06:23,270 --> 00:06:24,240
are all here.

149
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:25,830
What's more,

150
00:06:27,190 --> 00:06:28,270
The Fair Shura.

151
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:29,920
After so many years,

152
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:31,270
all that belongs to him

153
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:33,310
is returned to him at last.

154
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:34,920
Miss Gu.

155
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,070
You are determined to leave?

156
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:39,160
Is there any excuse or reason

157
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:40,160
for me to stay?

158
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,270
Actually,

159
00:06:42,270 --> 00:06:43,720
neither of you is wrong.

160
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:45,950
Mr. Mo had been there,

161
00:06:45,950 --> 00:06:47,040
so he felt regretful

162
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:47,950
and tried to make up.

163
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:50,800
I can't repay him.

164
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:52,560
What he has been through

165
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:55,120
is crueler than mine.

166
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:55,800
But you are not

167
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:57,600
supposed to bear everything.

168
00:06:57,830 --> 00:06:59,680
It was the Shens who started it.

169
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:01,560
Your father just followed
Marshal Shen's order.

170
00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:03,720
I know.

171
00:07:08,070 --> 00:07:08,870
Miss Gu.

172
00:07:10,510 --> 00:07:11,240
Mr. Mo

173
00:07:12,070 --> 00:07:12,920
woke up.

174
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:15,600
Why don't you see him?

175
00:07:58,360 --> 00:07:59,360
Did you get hurt?

176
00:08:01,390 --> 00:08:02,190
No.

177
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:03,800
Good then.

178
00:08:05,070 --> 00:08:07,310
Ye Yifan, why?

179
00:08:08,270 --> 00:08:09,800
Why did you risk your life to save me

180
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:11,190
after all that I did to you?

181
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,390
Were you going to make me regretful

182
00:08:13,390 --> 00:08:15,000
all my life?

183
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:19,000
I wanted to take a bet one last time

184
00:08:20,270 --> 00:08:21,950
that you would forgive me in the end

185
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:23,720
and wouldn't let me die.

186
00:08:26,750 --> 00:08:28,120
What if you lose?

187
00:08:29,390 --> 00:08:30,190
Did you think

188
00:08:30,190 --> 00:08:31,920
about what would happen if you lost?

189
00:08:37,870 --> 00:08:39,480
It didn't matter.

190
00:08:40,480 --> 00:08:41,790
You would get what you wanted

191
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:43,790
and I would die a worthy death.

192
00:08:49,030 --> 00:08:50,670
But I won at last.

193
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:53,390
You warned me peremptorily

194
00:08:53,390 --> 00:08:54,630
not to die.

195
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:01,480
Since you know I can't bear
to see you die,

196
00:09:02,510 --> 00:09:03,720
don't regret it.

197
00:09:04,510 --> 00:09:05,360
Ye Yifan,

198
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,600
do live on.

199
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:10,510
Okay.

200
00:09:22,150 --> 00:09:22,960
I'm sorry.

201
00:09:24,030 --> 00:09:25,910
When I saw you kill my father,

202
00:09:26,670 --> 00:09:27,960
I was grieved.

203
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:30,600
I felt so much pain

204
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:32,790
and thought the world
was so cruel to me.

205
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:34,910
But I didn't know

206
00:09:34,910 --> 00:09:37,360
if you were more painful than me.

207
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:38,480
Enough.

208
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:40,240
Each time

209
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:41,600
we were in a dilemma,

210
00:09:41,910 --> 00:09:43,150
you chose to hurt yourself

211
00:09:43,150 --> 00:09:44,270
to protect me.

212
00:09:44,910 --> 00:09:45,960
Even now,

213
00:09:46,390 --> 00:09:47,790
you are still concealing the truth

214
00:09:47,790 --> 00:09:49,240
in case I get hurt.

215
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:50,960
Ye Yifan,

216
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:51,840
haven't you...

217
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:53,360
I said, enough.

218
00:09:59,510 --> 00:10:00,320
Qingyan.

219
00:10:01,550 --> 00:10:03,510
I love you more than you expected,

220
00:10:04,390 --> 00:10:06,630
as well as I did.

221
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:10,440
Even if I'm your enemy's daughter?

222
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:13,150
I'm your enemy, too.

223
00:10:14,550 --> 00:10:15,840
Love

224
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:17,270
or hatred,

225
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,870
we should face it together,

226
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:22,030
unless

227
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:25,720
you no longer want me.

228
00:10:27,870 --> 00:10:29,720
I did want to leave you.

229
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:34,670
Ye Yifan,

230
00:10:35,870 --> 00:10:37,910
I thought we were even,

231
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:39,720
but my family

232
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:42,870
still owes you dozens of lives.

233
00:10:50,550 --> 00:10:51,720
Then use your whole life

234
00:10:54,030 --> 00:10:55,480
to repay it.

235
00:10:56,510 --> 00:10:58,080
If you can't pay it off this life,

236
00:10:58,630 --> 00:10:59,840
do it in the next one.

237
00:11:07,670 --> 00:11:08,480
Ye Yifan.

238
00:11:09,670 --> 00:11:11,480
Do you know why I love you deeply?

239
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:14,030
Because we are of the same kind.

240
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:17,360
We are both the daggers
forged by someone.

241
00:11:17,630 --> 00:11:19,320
So we are meant to have no affection.

242
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:21,440
You know it.

243
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:23,480
If you were me,

244
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:26,440
