Of course.

00:00:48,150 --> 00:00:49,110
It is Mr. Mo's first formal

Tell all the men

00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:50,920
Find her and her butler

00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:52,950

Go.

00:01:54,870 --> 00:01:55,350
Yes.

27
00:01:55,640 --> 00:01:56,840
Mr. Mo, calm down.

28
00:01:56,840 --> 00:01:58,400
She will be fine wherever she is.

So you know me.

Liu Cheng sounds like an ordinary name.

Although the mansion's power failure
didn't last long,

Since you guessed my true identity,

00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:22,590
you must have

62
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:24,150
figured out many things.

was you.

66

Yes.

67

kill your mom and several servants,

69
00:03:35,470 --> 00:03:36,590
but most of the Mos

70
00:03:37,030 --> 00:03:38,240
were killed by me.

71
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:44,080
I didn't expect

that the notorious Viper

73

77
00:03:56,280 --> 00:03:57,150
It's a shame

78
00:03:57,750 --> 00:03:59,000
he failed

79
00:03:59,190 --> 00:04:01,150
to open the Fair Shura
after so many years.

80
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:03,560

81
00:04:06,310 --> 00:04:08,590
It was you who incited him, right?

Gu Tingwei

83
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:11,030
was just a mindless wuss.

84
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,280
So all that he did

85
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:14,840
was planned by me.

86
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:23,240
I will give you the Fair Shura.

87

you will get nothing.

I have no treasure map for you,

something else instead.
