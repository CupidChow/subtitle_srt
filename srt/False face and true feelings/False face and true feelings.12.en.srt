00:00:43,790 --> 00:00:44,640
Miss Su.

4
00:00:45,320 --> 00:00:46,390
Tell her

5
00:00:46,790 --> 00:00:48,280
who Mr. Mo is.

6
00:00:52,560 --> 00:00:53,350
Gu Qingyan.

7
00:00:53,880 --> 00:00:55,710
You can't be with Yifan.

8
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:57,790
He lied to you.

9
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:01,280
In fact,

10
00:01:08,590 --> 00:01:09,510
he is Mr. Mo.

11
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:16,680
Mr. Mo.

12
00:01:17,560 --> 00:01:18,200
How to deal with him?

13
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:18,950
Take him back.

14
00:01:20,760 --> 00:01:21,640
You...

15
00:01:21,950 --> 00:01:23,000
You are...

16
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:28,790
Yes.

17
00:01:33,430 --> 00:01:35,070
I am Mr. Mo.

18
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:38,310
Take him away.

19
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:56,560
Wait for me outside.

20
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:57,040
Yes.

21
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:35,870
Hi.

22
00:02:48,030 --> 00:02:48,750
Do you have something

23
00:02:48,750 --> 00:02:49,840
to tell me?

24
00:02:57,190 --> 00:02:58,000
Qingyan.

25
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:01,590
If the family of your love

26
00:03:02,150 --> 00:03:03,590
hurts yours,

27
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:05,870
what will you do?

28
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:10,750
I will pretend to be ignorant

29
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:12,560
and look into it secretly.

30
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:15,280
Then I will deal him a fatal blow.

31
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:25,710
What if

32
00:03:26,710 --> 00:03:28,360
he would hate you because of it?

33
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:29,720
Hate?

34
00:03:30,150 --> 00:03:31,240
I would prefer that he hate me,

35
00:03:31,870 --> 00:03:33,400
so he wouldn't suffer because of it

36
00:03:34,030 --> 00:03:35,710
and could break free
from his family's fault.

37
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:55,910
Ye Yifan,

38
00:03:57,240 --> 00:03:58,800
I believe nobody

39
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:00,630
but you.

40
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:03,120
If you never lied to me,

41
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:04,680
kiss me.

42
00:05:19,630 --> 00:05:20,480
Ye Yifan.

43
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:22,800
Do you love me?

44
00:05:25,070 --> 00:05:25,870
Of course.

45
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:29,390
I love you.

46
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:38,480
See?

47
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:41,870
I have left a way out for both of us.

48
00:05:42,950 --> 00:05:45,480
But why do you refuse
to tell me the truth?

49
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:49,070
I want to know

50
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:50,600
your thoughts

51
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:51,720
when I tried so desperately

52
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:52,830
to be with you.

53
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:54,870
What were your feelings
when I offered

54
00:05:54,870 --> 00:05:56,240
to help you seek revenge, Mr. Mo?

55
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:57,480
Mr. Mo.

56
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:06,600
Qingyan.

57
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:07,270
No...

58
00:06:17,750 --> 00:06:18,870
It was me who taught you

59
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:21,720
how to use a gun in Yuncheng.

60
00:06:23,830 --> 00:06:24,680
You also taught me

61
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:26,870
not to trust anyone easily.

62
00:06:27,830 --> 00:06:29,000
So I only trusted you

63
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,040
except my father in this world.

64
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:33,950
How could you do that to me?

65
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:35,830
I'm sorry, Qingyan.

66
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:38,750
But no matter what I say now,

67
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:41,630
it won't be the answer you want.

68
00:06:48,270 --> 00:06:50,310
What answer can you give me?

69
00:06:50,310 --> 00:06:51,430
Ye Yifan.

70
00:06:54,310 --> 00:06:56,870
You kept saying that I'm your woman.

71
00:06:58,390 --> 00:07:00,270
How could you lie to me?

72
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:05,560
I will never forgive you.

73
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:21,430
If you hate me,

74
00:07:23,870 --> 00:07:25,390
shoot me now.
