Right.

114
00:07:36,980 --> 00:07:38,100
So you mean

our first meeting in the church

116
00:07:41,780 --> 00:07:43,250

Each word you said

118
00:07:45,460 --> 00:07:47,780
and each thing you did
were to deceive me?

119
00:07:51,410 --> 00:07:53,100
When I said I would be your woman,

120
00:07:53,900 --> 00:07:55,050
I meant it.

121
00:07:55,050 --> 00:07:56,410
Because that was the only way

122
00:07:56,410 --> 00:07:58,610
to make me willing
to help you revenge.

147
00:09:37,460 --> 00:09:39,460
I have to say that you are calculating.

148
00:09:39,890 --> 00:09:40,980
But you shouldn't have made me

150
00:09:42,460 --> 00:09:44,460
