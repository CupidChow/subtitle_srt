3
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:44,390
Apologize!

4
00:00:49,240 --> 00:00:50,150
I didn't say it wrong.

5
00:00:50,150 --> 00:00:51,750
Why should I apologize?

6
00:00:52,070 --> 00:00:53,430
I'm telling you to apologize.

7
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:56,280
Yifan.

8
00:00:56,430 --> 00:00:58,390
Yifan, help me.

9
00:00:59,030 --> 00:01:00,030
Miss Gu, take it easy.

10
00:01:00,030 --> 00:01:01,790
Miss Su has been willful.

11
00:01:01,960 --> 00:01:03,200
Tell me if she makes any mistakes.

12
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:04,230
Let me apologize to you
on behalf of her.

13
00:01:06,280 --> 00:01:07,840
Let me repeat.

14
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:09,040
Apologize.

15
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:15,840
I'm sorry.

18

Look at her.

19
00:01:25,710 --> 00:01:27,230
She did lie to you.

20
00:01:27,790 --> 00:01:29,040
I just talked

21
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:30,790
about that vicious Gu Tingwei.

23
00:01:32,150 --> 00:01:34,000
she wanted to kill me, Yifan.

25
00:01:38,710 --> 00:01:39,870

26

Nobody let her out

27
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:41,920
without my permission.

28
00:01:42,760 --> 00:01:43,230
Yes.

Yifan did hurt you,

32
00:01:51,310 --> 00:01:52,480
but your father

33
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:53,790
wasn't an innocent person.

34
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:54,840
You will regret it

35
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:56,200
if you hurt him.

36
00:02:20,710 --> 00:02:22,000
Don't worry, Qingyan.

37
00:02:23,150 --> 00:02:24,150
You have got me.

38
00:02:29,590 --> 00:02:31,520
She said I faked amnesia.

39
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:33,910
Do you believe me?

40
00:02:35,150 --> 00:02:35,960
I do.

41
00:02:37,430 --> 00:02:39,310
I believe anything you say.

42
00:02:40,150 --> 00:02:41,560
No matter what you want,

43
00:02:42,630 --> 00:02:43,840

44

What if I am deceiving you?

45

Give it a try

46
00:03:00,750 --> 00:03:02,150
and see if I want to be deceived.

47
00:03:04,870 --> 00:03:05,680
I'm sorry.

48
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:06,960
I have no idea

49

why I did that just now.

50
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:08,910
It's fine.

51
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:10,910

I don't have much time.

58
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,680
Meng Huaizuo is still watching me
at the banquet.

59
00:03:58,870 --> 00:03:59,680
So?

60
00:04:00,310 --> 00:04:01,470
Four of the people

61
00:04:01,750 --> 00:04:03,630
on the list are fishy.

62
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:04,910
I'm trying

63
00:04:04,910 --> 00:04:06,280
to investigate the forces behind them.

64
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:07,910
He's a discreet man.

65
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:09,120
Since he uses four people,

66
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:10,750
maybe only he can contact them.

67
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:13,150
In that case,

68
00:04:13,630 --> 00:04:14,630
there are four groups

69
00:04:14,630 --> 00:04:15,750
of people we don't know

70
00:04:15,750 --> 00:04:16,870
at least.

71
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:19,040
Those people

72
00:04:19,430 --> 00:04:21,480
will fear him more after today.

73
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:22,830
Then it will be harder to kill him.

74
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:25,680
We need to come up with an idea

75
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:26,630
to find

76
00:04:26,950 --> 00:04:28,040
and rope them in quickly.

77
00:04:34,070 --> 00:04:34,950
I heard

78
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:36,750
that you have the Fair Shura.

79
00:04:36,750 --> 00:04:37,480
Yes.

80
00:04:37,630 --> 00:04:38,870
Then the treasure map in it...

81
00:04:40,630 --> 00:04:42,160
They all talk about it.

82
00:04:42,310 --> 00:04:43,600
Yet my father spent 15 years on it

83
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:45,630
but still failed to find a way to open it.

84
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:50,120
If we can get the map,

85
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:51,310
we may gather more forces

86
00:04:51,310 --> 00:04:52,510
to deal with him.

87
00:05:05,830 --> 00:05:07,270
She went to see Shen Annian?

88
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:08,160
Yes.

89

Sir.

90
00:05:11,510 --> 00:05:13,070
You really think Miss Gu
lost her memories?

91
00:05:19,510 --> 00:05:20,630
How's Wanyin?

92
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:22,160
Still mad,

93
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:23,510
saying she will never talk to you.

94
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:25,070
Why don't you take a look at her?

95
00:05:25,190 --> 00:05:26,270
She will calm down

96
00:05:26,270 --> 00:05:27,310
if you say something sweet.

97
00:05:29,830 --> 00:05:30,720
Leave her be.

98
00:05:31,830 --> 00:05:32,630
Okay.

99
00:05:38,750 --> 00:05:39,560
Mother.

100
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:43,070
There is a consequence for everything.

101
00:05:43,950 --> 00:05:45,480
If I lied to her once,

102
00:05:46,630 --> 00:05:49,430
could I repay her by being deceived
by her numerous times?

103
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:53,720
If we can get the map,

104
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:54,830
we may gather more forces

105
00:05:54,830 --> 00:05:56,360
to deal with him.

106
00:05:58,270 --> 00:06:00,390
Ye Yifan had been looking
for the Fair Shura for so long,

107
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:03,190
but he didn't care when I gave it

108
00:06:03,630 --> 00:06:04,950
to him.

109
00:06:06,190 --> 00:06:08,510
He doesn't want the treasure map?

110
00:06:22,510 --> 00:06:23,160
Come in.

Can't sleep.

114
00:06:37,270 --> 00:06:38,480
I want to treat you to a drink.

115
00:06:47,310 --> 00:06:48,310
You shouldn't drink

116
00:06:48,830 --> 00:06:49,870
since you haven't recovered.

117
00:06:55,950 --> 00:06:56,800
What about you?

118
00:07:00,070 --> 00:07:01,270
You want me to drink?

119
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:05,000
Me?

120
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,190
Is there something you want to say?

121
00:07:34,430 --> 00:07:35,240
Mr. Mo.

122

123
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:42,070
is it true?

00:07:54,630 --> 00:07:55,630
He tried for many years

128
00:07:55,630 --> 00:07:57,000
to open it but in vain.

129
00:07:57,160 --> 00:07:58,360
Can you open it?

Mr. Mo?

131
00:08:05,950 --> 00:08:07,360
You want the treasure map?

132
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:10,120
Who would not be interested

133
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:11,680
in the treasure map?

134
00:08:13,950 --> 00:08:14,800
Yes.

135
00:08:16,310 --> 00:08:17,830
I know how to open it.

136
00:08:17,950 --> 00:08:19,270
Would you help me then?

137
00:08:22,310 --> 00:08:23,120
Okay.

138
00:08:23,950 --> 00:08:25,000
I can open it for you,

but not now.
