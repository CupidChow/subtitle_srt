191
00:10:00,890 --> 00:10:01,650
Sorry.

192
00:10:02,010 --> 00:10:03,100
I was rash.

193
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:09,500
To think you know Mr. Shen.

194
00:10:12,220 --> 00:10:13,700
As a dancer,

195
00:10:13,980 --> 00:10:15,770
isn't it ordinary for me

196
00:10:16,460 --> 00:10:17,650
to know some celebrities?

197
00:10:22,010 --> 00:10:23,610
But it seems you fear Shen Annian.

198
00:10:24,460 --> 00:10:25,650
What are you afraid of?

199
00:10:32,730 --> 00:10:34,490
Don't be hard on yourself

200
00:10:34,530 --> 00:10:36,010
since you don't trust me.

201
00:10:36,820 --> 00:10:38,010
Anyway,

202
00:10:38,530 --> 00:10:40,770
I'm sure you'll know
my feelings one day.

203
00:10:49,460 --> 00:10:50,250
Mr. Mo.

204
00:10:50,300 --> 00:10:51,120
Find out the relationship

205
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:52,820
between Xia Zhiqiu and Shen Annian.

206
00:10:53,340 --> 00:10:54,370
Keep an eye on her.

207
00:10:55,850 --> 00:10:56,700
Got it.

208
00:11:07,770 --> 00:11:08,850
I almost forgot

209
00:11:09,060 --> 00:11:10,580
that Annian would come here

210
00:11:11,250 --> 00:11:12,530
and he could recognize me

211
00:11:12,530 --> 00:11:13,850
even after a few years.

212
00:11:16,060 --> 00:11:17,610
Should I keep him in the dark?

213
00:11:30,730 --> 00:11:31,530
Qingyan.

214
00:11:31,770 --> 00:11:32,850
It's really you.

215
00:11:34,220 --> 00:11:35,060
Annian.

216
00:11:36,820 --> 00:11:37,650
It's been a while.
