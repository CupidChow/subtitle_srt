[Episode 11]

3
00:00:55,030 --> 00:00:56,150
Why did you come here?

4
00:00:57,320 --> 00:00:58,920
You don't look so happy

5
00:00:59,150 --> 00:01:00,320
to see me.

6
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:02,640
You are Gu Qingyan's friend.

7
00:01:02,920 --> 00:01:04,120
So you are not a good man.

8
00:01:06,350 --> 00:01:08,000
It doesn't matter if I'm a good man.

9
00:01:08,310 --> 00:01:09,760
We can be friends

10
00:01:10,150 --> 00:01:11,430
if we share the same interests.

11
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:15,710
Who shares your interests?

12
00:01:19,350 --> 00:01:20,560
Don't you

13
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:21,640
want your Yifan

14
00:01:21,870 --> 00:01:23,870
to fall out with Gu Qingyan?

15
00:01:27,510 --> 00:01:28,480
You know what to do?

16
00:01:30,590 --> 00:01:32,280
I know Qingyan the best.

17
00:01:32,510 --> 00:01:34,070
She hates to be deceived.

18
00:01:34,310 --> 00:01:36,790
If she knows who Mr. Mo is,

19
00:01:37,230 --> 00:01:38,920
I'm pretty sure she will cut the ties

20
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:40,310
with Ye Yifan.

21
00:01:43,230 --> 00:01:45,480
How do I know who Mr. Mo is?

22
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:46,350
You do.

23
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:48,590
Miss Su.

24
00:01:48,950 --> 00:01:49,790
It's the only way

25
00:01:49,790 --> 00:01:50,950
to separate them.

26
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:52,710
You really want to see your Yifan

27
00:01:52,870 --> 00:01:54,200
get involved in trouble?

28
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:06,870
Just take your time to think about it.

29
00:02:06,870 --> 00:02:07,870
Feel free to see me anytime

30
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:09,910
when you make up your mind.

31
00:02:24,750 --> 00:02:25,520
Mr. Mo.

32
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:27,470
Our men are sending Miss Gu
to her mansion.

33
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:29,590
Any news from Meng Huaizuo?

34
00:02:29,590 --> 00:02:30,710
He has found the man.

35
00:02:30,710 --> 00:02:31,750
You want to see him now?

36
00:02:36,030 --> 00:02:37,030
I need an answer

37
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:39,310
anyway.

38
00:02:41,590 --> 00:02:42,280
Take me there.

39
00:02:52,030 --> 00:02:52,840
Don't kill me.

40
00:02:54,910 --> 00:02:55,960
Please.

41
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:12,560
Sir.

42
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:13,710
As you ordered,

43
00:03:13,910 --> 00:03:14,870
I tortured him

44
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:15,750
without killing him.

45
00:03:22,710 --> 00:03:23,870
Ye Yifan.

46
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:25,310
I...

47
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:27,840
am not your enemy.

48
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:28,870
I...

49
00:03:28,870 --> 00:03:32,910
I just scrambled
for some land with Mr. Mo,

50
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:35,870
how could you do this to me?

51
00:03:37,630 --> 00:03:39,280
You are not my enemy?

52
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:43,800
About the Fair Shura

53
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:45,680
you mentioned,

54
00:03:46,430 --> 00:03:49,150
I really don't have it.

55
00:03:49,750 --> 00:03:51,150
I bought

56
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:54,910
the Gus' mansion from someone else.

57
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:58,470
You can't fabricate an excuse

58
00:03:59,430 --> 00:04:01,400
to kill me.

59
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:03,750
You would have been dead if you said

60
00:04:04,310 --> 00:04:05,630
that Fair Shura was at your home.

61
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:08,240
I tortured you today

62
00:04:08,630 --> 00:04:10,520
because of something else.

63
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:14,280
You sent people

64
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:16,070
to kill me in Yuncheng before.

65
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:17,480
I was only 11

66
00:04:17,630 --> 00:04:19,000
and you did that

67
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,630
because I saved your daughter,

68
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:21,750
right?

69
00:04:25,830 --> 00:04:26,870
It was because...

70
00:04:26,870 --> 00:04:28,630
Because you didn't want others

71
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:30,390
to know you could use your daughter

72
00:04:30,390 --> 00:04:32,480
as a shield when you were in danger.

73
00:04:32,830 --> 00:04:34,480
She was just eight.

74
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:35,800
She refused to tell me her name

75
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:37,560
no matter how I asked her.

76
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:40,120
Because you told her
to keep it a secret.

77
00:04:40,390 --> 00:04:41,950
You wanted to make her a killer

78
00:04:41,950 --> 00:04:43,310
to serve you

79
00:04:43,310 --> 00:04:44,240
in the first place.

80
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:45,430
So she shouldn't have concerns

81
00:04:45,430 --> 00:04:46,800
except you.

82
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:55,750
You heard about me from her.

83
00:04:56,360 --> 00:04:58,000
So you tried to get rid of me.

84
00:04:58,430 --> 00:04:59,920
But you didn't expect

85
00:05:00,830 --> 00:05:02,040
we would meet again.

86
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,630
It was more than a decade ago.

87
00:05:12,270 --> 00:05:13,070
Besides,

88
00:05:13,950 --> 00:05:15,190
you are still alive.

89
00:05:16,270 --> 00:05:18,160
Just let me go

90
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:20,160
since you spent over half a year

91
00:05:20,630 --> 00:05:21,920
with her.

92
00:05:22,630 --> 00:05:23,190
I...

93
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:25,430
am her dad after all.

94
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:29,040
When did you treat her as your daughter?

95
00:05:29,630 --> 00:05:31,190
When you knew I wanted the Fair Shura,

96
00:05:31,190 --> 00:05:32,040
you faked death

97
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:33,560
to survive

98
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:34,750
and let her avenge you.

99
00:05:35,270 --> 00:05:36,120
Gu Tingwei,

100
00:05:36,310 --> 00:05:37,600
didn't you know

101
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:38,830
that she would die

102
00:05:38,830 --> 00:05:39,920
if she was careless?

103
00:05:49,630 --> 00:05:51,070
The days in Yuncheng

104
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:53,800
were the darkest time in my life,

105
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:56,160
only she accompanied,

106
00:05:56,630 --> 00:05:57,390
looked after,

107
00:05:58,040 --> 00:05:59,040
and protected me.

108
00:06:00,190 --> 00:06:03,040
So she is my most cherished family.

109
00:06:06,390 --> 00:06:07,190
But you,

110
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:09,480
her true family,

111
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:11,510
never cared about her life.

112
00:06:11,830 --> 00:06:12,950
I know I was wrong.

113
00:06:13,430 --> 00:06:14,600
Please don't kill me.

114
00:06:15,950 --> 00:06:17,160
I can apologize to her

115
00:06:17,750 --> 00:06:18,870
and I can give you

116
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:20,070
anything you want.

117
00:06:20,310 --> 00:06:21,870
Don't you love Qingyan?

118
00:06:22,270 --> 00:06:23,190
I can make the call

119
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:24,780
to betroth her to you.

120
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:34,430
The way you are begging for mercy now

121
00:06:34,430 --> 00:06:36,600
makes it hard
to believe you killed people before.

122
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:38,800
It's a shame

123
00:06:41,270 --> 00:06:42,800
that the scar has exposed you.

124
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:47,560
What can a scar prove?

125
00:06:47,630 --> 00:06:48,600
Answer me.

126
00:06:49,310 --> 00:06:51,270
How did you get the Fair Shura?

127
00:06:51,510 --> 00:06:53,240
I... I told you.

128
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:55,000
I told you the truth.

129
00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:56,390
I have no idea
what you are talking about.

130
00:06:56,390 --> 00:06:56,870
Fine.

131
00:06:57,950 --> 00:06:59,870
I'll ask Qingyan.

132
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:02,070
She will tell me the truth.

133
00:07:11,270 --> 00:07:12,070
Qingyan.

134
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:14,270
Are you mad at me?

135
00:07:15,430 --> 00:07:16,310
Annian.

136
00:07:16,750 --> 00:07:18,070
Tell me frankly.

137
00:07:18,750 --> 00:07:20,000
Those outside are all your men,

138
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:20,680
right?

139
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:22,120
Only the marshal

140
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:23,510
could dispatch a sniper.

141
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:28,190
Why did you try to kill him?

142
00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:31,480
Qingyan.

143
00:07:32,430 --> 00:07:34,040
Don't you know the answer?

144
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:36,870
I'd like to ask you.

145
00:07:36,950 --> 00:07:38,240
Why did you risk your life

146
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:39,270
to save him?

147
00:07:40,070 --> 00:07:41,560
Because you wouldn't be able

148
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:43,480
to find Mr. Mo once he died?

149
00:07:44,630 --> 00:07:45,430
Or

150
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,270
because you care about him?

151
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:53,430
I care about him.

152
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:54,510
I admit that.

153
00:07:58,040 --> 00:07:59,360
Even if he uses you?

154
00:07:59,830 --> 00:08:01,240
I have nothing to be used by him.

155
00:08:01,950 --> 00:08:02,750
You have.

156
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:04,680
Gu Qingyan.

157
00:08:05,270 --> 00:08:06,430
I hinted

158
00:08:06,830 --> 00:08:08,240
that Mr. Mo could be in the nightclub.

159
00:08:11,190 --> 00:08:12,040
I know

160
00:08:12,950 --> 00:08:14,600
you never trusted me.

161
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:16,390
It's alright.

162
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:18,950
I have brought someone here to tell you.

163
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:32,720
Miss Su.

164
00:08:34,750 --> 00:08:35,840
Tell her

165
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:37,840
who Mr. Mo is.

166
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:39,870
I...

167
00:08:45,870 --> 00:08:46,750
Miss Su.

168
00:08:47,790 --> 00:08:50,000
You'd better make sure
you will tell me the truth.

169
00:08:54,270 --> 00:08:55,080
Gu Qingyan.

170
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:57,440
You can't be with Yifan.

171
00:08:58,360 --> 00:08:59,510
He lied to you.

172
00:09:01,550 --> 00:09:03,000
In fact,

173
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:11,240
he is Mr. Mo.
