It's been a while.

00:01:00,180 --> 00:01:01,730
Why didn't you tell me
you came back to Rongcheng?

8
00:01:02,090 --> 00:01:03,220
Why didn't you let me help you?

9
00:01:03,820 --> 00:01:05,330
It was too perilous.

10
00:01:05,730 --> 00:01:07,220
I didn't want to get you involved.

Am I so fragile?

13
00:01:11,380 --> 00:01:13,050
My father is a military governor,
after all.

14
00:01:13,690 --> 00:01:15,260
Though it's a nominal position now,

15
00:01:15,260 --> 00:01:16,570
he has troops.

16
00:01:17,130 --> 00:01:18,020
So I can help you.

17
00:01:18,020 --> 00:01:18,820
Annian,

18
00:01:19,130 --> 00:01:19,850
I shouldn't

19
00:01:19,850 --> 00:01:20,900
use your father's troops

20
00:01:20,900 --> 00:01:22,490
to handle my issues.

21

Besides,

I know you are having a tough life

23
00:01:25,290 --> 00:01:26,290
in your family.

24
00:01:26,770 --> 00:01:27,900
I hate to implicate you.

25
00:01:31,380 --> 00:01:32,740
Even you look down upon me?

26
00:01:37,850 --> 00:01:38,980
That's not what I mean.

What's your relationship with him?

29
00:01:46,330 --> 00:01:47,900
He's just in my plan.

30
00:01:48,410 --> 00:01:50,180
I will use him to find Mr. Mo.

31
00:01:51,020 --> 00:01:51,980
So you have become

Ye Yifan has been staying
in the ballroom.

34
00:01:56,820 --> 00:01:57,740

it is the place for him to meet Mr. Mo.

37
00:02:01,540 --> 00:02:03,210
Mr. Mo isn't a simple man
like you think.

38
00:02:03,620 --> 00:02:04,660
He could build up his sphere

within a few years.

40
00:02:06,660 --> 00:02:07,690
You're no match for him.

00:02:13,770 --> 00:02:14,820
how do I have the cheek

46
00:02:14,820 --> 00:02:16,130
to be a killer of Cloud Hall?

47
00:02:18,290 --> 00:02:19,980
I won't stop it no matter what you do.

48
00:02:20,410 --> 00:02:21,660
But you have to promise me

49
00:02:22,100 --> 00:02:23,100
