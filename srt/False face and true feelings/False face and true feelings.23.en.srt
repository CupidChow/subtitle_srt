[Episode 23]

3
00:00:48,030 --> 00:00:50,490
Annian, could you take me in?

4
00:00:52,280 --> 00:00:53,200
You seem

5
00:00:54,280 --> 00:00:55,430
to be blaming me.

6
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:58,000
You used me, didn't you?

7
00:00:58,560 --> 00:00:59,640
You didn't believe

8
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:00,790
the intelligence I gave you.

9
00:01:01,150 --> 00:01:02,390
You wanted to kill Ye Yifan.

10
00:01:02,710 --> 00:01:04,040
You bought over Mr. Liu

11
00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:05,200
and pretended to be in danger.

12
00:01:05,590 --> 00:01:07,560
When I went to question him,

13
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:08,790
you took action.

14
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:09,870
You knew

15
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:11,950
he would risk his life to protect me

16
00:01:12,150 --> 00:01:13,790
and thus let down his guard.

17
00:01:14,920 --> 00:01:17,150
Then you took that chance
to raid his forces.

18
00:01:17,310 --> 00:01:19,000
Since Ye Yifan was badly wounded,

19
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:20,400
he couldn't help them,

20
00:01:20,760 --> 00:01:22,510
that's how you took them out
one by one.

21
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:24,230
Wasn't it

22
00:01:24,760 --> 00:01:26,710
what you expected, too?

23
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:31,790
Indeed.

24
00:01:32,710 --> 00:01:34,350
But if he hadn't saved me,

25
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:35,840
I would have been dead.

26
00:01:39,230 --> 00:01:40,040
Annian.

27
00:01:40,430 --> 00:01:42,310
You have been the one who set the trap.

28
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:44,230
And I am just a pawn for you.

29
00:01:46,150 --> 00:01:47,400
Since it was either him or me,

30
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:49,560
I couldn't have too many concerns.

31
00:01:50,150 --> 00:01:52,640
It was true he tried
to kill me with my father.

32
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:54,760
So I had to do it first.

33
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:57,950
After all, I couldn't let him know

34
00:01:58,150 --> 00:01:59,150
that it was I

35
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:01,510
who suggested my father
kill the Mos 15 years ago.

36
00:02:03,150 --> 00:02:05,040
You were just ten then.

37
00:02:05,150 --> 00:02:06,400
How could you be so merciless?

38
00:02:08,150 --> 00:02:09,710
My father was a military governor,

39
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:11,520
but I couldn't

40
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,080
acquire such power when I was born

41
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:16,630
because I was his concubine's son.

42
00:02:16,910 --> 00:02:18,470
No matter how much effort

43
00:02:18,470 --> 00:02:20,120
I spent more than my brothers,

44
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:22,150
my father wouldn't grant me the power.

45
00:02:22,710 --> 00:02:24,000
So I had

46
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:26,190
to find a way to get it.

47
00:02:26,470 --> 00:02:28,030
I needed to show Shen Wancheng

48
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:30,030
that I was more outstanding

49
00:02:30,030 --> 00:02:31,800
than his other sons.

50
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:34,280
You controlled your father?

51
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:35,590
No.

52
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:37,590
I killed him.

53
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:48,030
Qingyan. Tell me.

54
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,560
Can I trust you?

55
00:02:53,870 --> 00:02:54,680
Certainly.

56
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:55,960
After all,

57
00:02:55,960 --> 00:02:57,430
I have nobody else to rely on,

58
00:02:57,430 --> 00:02:58,240
right?

59
00:02:59,710 --> 00:03:00,520
Okay.

60
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:01,840
Since you said so,

61
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:03,630
let me show you someone.

62
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:12,800
Meng Huaizuo, why are you here?

63
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:15,870
I followed him for so many years.

64
00:03:16,310 --> 00:03:17,520
Yet he hurt me badly

65
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:19,240
for a mere woman.

66
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:20,310
Do you think

67
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:22,190
I can still be loyal to him?

68
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:28,190
You know all the forces he conceals.

69
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:29,710
So he is doomed

70
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:31,750
as he lost you.

71
00:03:43,190 --> 00:03:44,000
What?

72
00:03:44,150 --> 00:03:45,000
What did you say?

73
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:46,430

Quarrel?

Gu Qingyan.

77
00:04:10,310 --> 00:04:11,910
Gu Qingyan, shame on you.

78
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:14,030
You are so short-tempered.

79
00:04:14,030 --> 00:04:14,800
Gu Qingyan.

80
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:16,000
Yifan almost got killed

for you

82
00:04:17,750 --> 00:04:19,240
and Mr. Meng betrayed him
because of you.

83
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:21,950
But you turned to Shen Annian.

84
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:24,240
I'm afraid you have forgotten

85
00:04:24,270 --> 00:04:25,680
that Ye Yifan killed my father.

86
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:26,920
It's his duty to save me.

87
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:27,950
It was your father

88
00:04:27,950 --> 00:04:29,720
who did unforgivable things first.

Even now,

90
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:32,190
you are still so irrational.

91
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:34,750
Fine. Let me teach you a lesson

92
00:04:34,750 --> 00:04:36,390

93
00:04:38,070 --> 00:04:39,870
Miss Su, I wouldn't get ahead of myself

94

if I were you.

95
00:04:41,510 --> 00:04:43,000
If you do this again,

96
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:45,240
I won't just hurt your hand.

97
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:48,830
Gu Qingyan, this is not over.

98
00:04:48,870 --> 00:04:50,390
You will pay for it.

Young master.

100
00:05:01,870 --> 00:05:03,870
Miss Su had a big fight with Miss Gu.

101
00:05:03,870 --> 00:05:05,160
It is getting worse.

102
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:07,390
Shall we send our men to handle it?

103
00:05:07,750 --> 00:05:08,600
No.

104
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:10,750
Tell everyone

105
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:12,000
to advance the action.

106
00:05:12,270 --> 00:05:13,070

00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:32,000
Who else except your Miss Gu?

110
00:05:32,190 --> 00:05:33,310
She said another person

111
00:05:33,310 --> 00:05:35,160
would draw suspicion,

112
00:05:35,270 --> 00:05:36,240
so only I could do it.

113
00:05:38,070 --> 00:05:40,360
Yifan, you have no idea

114
00:05:40,630 --> 00:05:42,720
how scary it was.

115
00:05:43,190 --> 00:05:44,630
I risked my life

116
00:05:44,630 --> 00:05:46,070
to deliver the message for you.

117
00:05:46,070 --> 00:05:47,120
How could you blame me?

118
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:48,360
So you knew it was risky.

119
00:05:50,750 --> 00:05:52,000
Don't do it again.

120
00:05:52,750 --> 00:05:53,920
Meng Huaizuo can take care
of everything.

121
00:05:54,390 --> 00:05:55,830
Mr. Meng didn't betray you?

122
00:05:59,870 --> 00:06:00,920
Does Miss Gu

123
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:03,070
know he was sent by you?

124
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:04,950
What?

125
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:06,390
You fear

126
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:08,120
that she may kill him?

127
00:06:08,950 --> 00:06:09,600
I...

128
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:16,390
Meng Huaizuo deserves it

129
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:18,310
if he's so useless.

130
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:19,310
Mr. Mo.

131
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:22,160
Enough.

132
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,430
Meng Huaizuo will be fine.

133
00:06:24,750 --> 00:06:25,870
Qingyan said

134
00:06:25,870 --> 00:06:27,510
that Shen Annian had killed
Marshal Shen already

135
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:29,680
and contacted all the big families.

136
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:33,510
He will take action soon.

137
00:06:33,750 --> 00:06:34,360
Shall I get rid

138
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:35,360
of those families?

139
00:06:35,750 --> 00:06:36,120
No.

140
00:06:36,870 --> 00:06:38,160
They are still on our side.

141
00:06:38,390 --> 00:06:39,920
They will fight fire with fire.

142
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:42,120
So everything

143
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:44,380
is going on as you planned?

144
00:06:44,750 --> 00:06:45,560
That is...

145
00:06:47,950 --> 00:06:49,480
Shen Annian thinks he is close

146
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:50,560
to his target.

147
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:53,390
In fact, he is going
to his end step by step.

148
00:07:48,830 --> 00:07:50,120
You came because you worried about me?

149
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:51,390
I remember our plan

150
00:07:51,390 --> 00:07:52,240
was to pretend to fall out.

151
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:53,720
But I didn't ask you
to stay in the Shens' mansion.

152
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,480
You told me to try
to stay away from danger,

153
00:07:56,830 --> 00:07:57,800
but how could I agree?

154
00:07:59,430 --> 00:08:00,480
Like I guessed.

155
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:03,310
Did you send Meng Huaizuo?

156
00:08:04,390 --> 00:08:05,750
To keep you safe.

157
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:09,510
What do you think
Shen Annian's next plan

158
00:08:09,510 --> 00:08:10,390
will be?

159
00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:13,950
I asked him to meet me at the dock.

160
00:08:15,430 --> 00:08:16,950
Don't do things rashly.

161
00:08:17,070 --> 00:08:17,950

162

163
00:08:24,310 --> 00:08:25,310
I missed you.

164
00:08:34,030 --> 00:08:34,960
I have to go.

165
00:08:36,270 --> 00:08:37,080
Be safe.

166
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:43,270
Ye Yifan, what is your plan?

167
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:46,080
Are you going
to face everything alone again?

168
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:51,750
Annian.

169
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:57,550
This is the chicken soup
I cooked for you.

170
00:08:57,960 --> 00:08:58,750
Have some.

try it for me?

Annian.
