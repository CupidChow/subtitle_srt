3
00:00:46,150 --> 00:00:47,790
If you hate me,

4
00:00:50,240 --> 00:00:51,750
shoot me now.

5
00:01:31,510 --> 00:01:33,200
Ye Yifan, did you bring so many men here

6
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:34,920
to get rid of me?

7
00:01:36,070 --> 00:01:37,040
Bring him inside.

8
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:44,710
Dad?

9
00:01:46,710 --> 00:01:47,680
You are alive?

10
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:48,790
Qingyan.

11
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,510
Help me!

12
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:52,350
Help me.

13
00:01:52,350 --> 00:01:53,870
Ye Yifan, what have you done

14
00:01:53,870 --> 00:01:54,640
to my dad?

15
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:56,120
Gu Qingyan, you ingrate!

16

19
00:02:02,590 --> 00:02:05,280
I did come to show my hand.

20
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:08,630
But there are things

00:02:11,190 --> 00:02:12,560
or know.

23
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:15,560
Is Fair Shura at your home?

24
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:18,910
You have done all of those things

25
00:02:18,910 --> 00:02:20,680
because of Fair Shura?

26
00:02:23,910 --> 00:02:24,710
Yes.

27
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:26,680
Give me Fair Shura.

28
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:28,870
Qingyan, don't listen to him.

29
00:02:28,870 --> 00:02:31,030
We don't have it.

30
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:33,680
He kidnapped and tortured me.

31

He is a monster.

Kill him right now!

00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:09,280
One last question.

38
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:13,960
When did the Gus

39
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:15,120
acquire Fair Shura?

40
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:19,840
Qingyan.

41
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:22,960
No. Don't tell him.

42
00:03:25,030 --> 00:03:26,120
When I was seven.

43
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:28,240
We hadn't met yet.

45
00:03:31,030 --> 00:03:33,190
No. It's not true.

46
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:36,750
It's not true.

47
00:03:37,190 --> 00:03:39,120
How could you lie?

48
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:41,680
Mr. Mo.

49
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:42,150
Take him away.

She lied to you.

Mr. Mo. She lied.

Mr. Mo...

53
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:47,470
Ye Yifan.

54
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:51,240
I have given you Fair Shura,

55
00:03:51,470 --> 00:03:53,080
so let my dad go.

56

but an answer.

After all,

65

you are the only one he trusts.

66
00:04:41,870 --> 00:04:42,800
Tell me,

67

who ordered you to kill all the Mos

68

69
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:49,120

I'm patient enough.

Yet you still

74

won't tell me the truth?

75
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:59,000
All right, I'll tell you.

76
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:03,480
The Mos' Fair Shura

77
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:05,830
was said to contain a treasure map

78
00:05:05,830 --> 00:05:08,270
of sunken ships of the Ming Dynasty.

79
00:05:08,750 --> 00:05:09,600
The interim government

[Top Secret, Fair Shura]

85
00:05:39,510 --> 00:05:42,310
Mr. Mo works at the Premier Secretariat.

86
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:45,160
Only you can do it.

87
00:05:46,390 --> 00:05:47,600
Do it secretly.

88
00:05:48,190 --> 00:05:51,240
Marshal Shen sent a group
of vassals to go with me.

89
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:52,720
- He agreed
- Run away!

90
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:54,070
to give me the mansion

91
00:05:54,190 --> 00:05:55,950
- when it was done.
- Run away!

92
00:05:59,190 --> 00:06:01,120
When I got Fair Shura,

93
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:02,560
out of greed,

94
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:04,600
I told Marshal Shen

95
00:06:04,870 --> 00:06:07,070
that I didn't find it.

96
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:10,920
Marshal Shen was a man of his word.

97
00:06:11,310 --> 00:06:14,160
So he took all the wealth of the Mos'

98
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:16,270
and gave the mansion to me.

99
00:06:17,630 --> 00:06:18,950
I have been

100
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:21,680
hiding Fair Shura these years.

101
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,310
I tried to open it

102
00:06:23,510 --> 00:06:25,600
but in vain.

103
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:29,600
Go on.

104
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:34,560
My leg was hurt by Mrs. Mo

105
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:36,560
when I killed her.

106
00:06:36,870 --> 00:06:38,680
So I was crippled.

107
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:42,950
I remembered that a kid got away

108
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,270
when I killed all the Mos.

109
00:06:46,870 --> 00:06:47,950
I was so afraid

110
00:06:48,750 --> 00:06:49,560
that

111
00:06:50,390 --> 00:06:53,390
I sent Qingyan to Yuncheng.

112
00:06:54,070 --> 00:06:55,750
So she could cover for me

113
00:06:56,560 --> 00:07:00,160
if he came after me.

114
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:04,830

116

I heard Mr. Mo of it

117
00:07:12,750 --> 00:07:14,720
had been looking for Fair Shura.

118
00:07:15,190 --> 00:07:17,160
I... I suspected

119
00:07:17,750 --> 00:07:20,600
that he was the kid who ran away.

120
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,190
So I dared not

121
00:07:23,270 --> 00:07:26,360
to let out any news about Fair Shura.

122
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:32,870
That was why you gave it to Qingyan.

123
00:07:34,190 --> 00:07:35,680
You used her as a shield

124
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:37,120
and a weapon to kill me.

125
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:38,750
How could

126
00:07:38,750 --> 00:07:40,190
there be such a vicious man like you?

127
00:07:41,270 --> 00:07:41,870
Mr. Mo.

128
00:07:42,270 --> 00:07:44,040
I told you everything

129
00:07:44,630 --> 00:07:46,680
and you got Fair Shura already.

130
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:47,870
I can also

131
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,390
return the mansion to you.

132
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:51,560
So don't kill me

133
00:07:52,630 --> 00:07:55,240
for Qingyan's sake.

134
00:07:56,270 --> 00:07:57,000
You will

135
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,950
be the master of the mansion

136
00:07:58,950 --> 00:08:01,070
and we can also be a family.

137
00:08:01,070 --> 00:08:01,920
Shut up!

Miss. Gu.

141
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:09,680
You'd better stay here

142

and do nothing.

143
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:12,560

145
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:19,360
right at this place,

146
00:08:19,510 --> 00:08:22,480
you killed my mom and all the others.

147
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:24,720
I... I'm sorry.

148
00:08:25,070 --> 00:08:26,390
I know I was wrong.

149
00:08:26,870 --> 00:08:29,480
I shouldn't have craved your property,

150
00:08:29,750 --> 00:08:31,920
but I was just following
Marshal Shen's order.

151
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:34,240
At least,

152
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:36,550
I let you go.

153
00:08:39,550 --> 00:08:41,630
You let me go?

154
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:43,030
No.

155
00:08:44,150 --> 00:08:46,720
Your mother helped you with her life.

156
00:08:50,390 --> 00:08:51,480
I'm not a human being.

157
00:08:51,910 --> 00:08:53,150
I'm an animal.

158
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:57,910
But Marshal Shen started
all those things.

159
00:08:58,270 --> 00:08:59,960
It was him.

160
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:02,630
Are you done?

161
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:05,630
Yes.

162
00:09:07,630 --> 00:09:08,240
OK.

163
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:13,000
Then you may die.

164
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:13,600
No.

Qingyan needs me.

She lost her mother when she was a kid.

168

So I'm the only one
she has in this world.

169
