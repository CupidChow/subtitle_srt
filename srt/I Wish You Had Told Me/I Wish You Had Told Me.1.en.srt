1
00:00:18,935 --> 00:00:21,771
I'm wearing Dad's favorite tie today.

2
00:00:23,815 --> 00:00:25,191
He told me,

3
00:00:26,985 --> 00:00:31,489
"It suits you better than me.
You'll use it more than I ever did."

4
00:00:31,573 --> 00:00:32,949
CONDOLENCES FROM PASTOR LEO MARQUEZ

5
00:00:33,033 --> 00:00:37,746
I'm sure we've all heard Dad
say things similar to that.

6
00:00:38,580 --> 00:00:42,292
Even when he had nothing,
if he could help and had the chance to…

7
00:00:44,794 --> 00:00:45,962
he would.

8
00:00:52,260 --> 00:00:55,096
Dad taught me a lot of things.

9
00:00:56,139 --> 00:01:00,268
But one thing he wasn't able to teach me
was how to live without him.

10
00:01:02,979 --> 00:01:03,980
It's hard.

11
00:01:04,481 --> 00:01:08,943
But I'm glad to know
that Dad will finally be in the company

12
00:01:09,444 --> 00:01:10,987
of our Holy Lord.

13
00:01:14,741 --> 00:01:16,159
His suffering has ended…

14
00:01:18,495 --> 00:01:20,080
for he has accepted

15
00:01:21,706 --> 00:01:24,292
eternal life

16
00:01:25,752 --> 00:01:27,545
in the company of our Holy Lord.

17
00:01:29,589 --> 00:01:30,423
Cecil.

18
00:01:33,593 --> 00:01:35,595
Excuse me. Excuse me, ma'am.

19
00:01:35,678 --> 00:01:36,513
Ma'am.

20
00:01:39,766 --> 00:01:41,434
You bitch.

21
00:01:42,102 --> 00:01:43,103
Ma'am…

22
00:01:43,186 --> 00:01:45,146
You can't just die.

23
00:01:46,773 --> 00:01:48,608
Is this how you get back at me?

24
00:01:49,567 --> 00:01:51,903
Because I stole your first kiss?

25
00:01:52,737 --> 00:01:54,322
Because you're still a virgin?

26
00:01:55,031 --> 00:01:56,241
A backdoor virgin!

27
00:01:58,576 --> 00:02:00,578
-Let's go over there.
-Right.

28
00:02:00,662 --> 00:02:03,498
There's food on the table,
feel free to help yourselves.

29
00:02:03,581 --> 00:02:06,960
You may be at the wrong funeral.
How did you know my dad?

30
00:02:07,961 --> 00:02:09,129
Are you Dad's ex?

31
00:02:13,049 --> 00:02:13,883
Ma'am.

32
00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:18,471
Did you hear that?

33
00:02:18,972 --> 00:02:20,723
He thinks I'm your ex!

34
00:02:20,807 --> 00:02:24,018
Please. You've sucked more dicks
than I ever have!

35
00:02:25,728 --> 00:02:27,438
-Otep!
-Ma'am, that's enough.

36
00:02:27,522 --> 00:02:29,274
Ma'am, come this way, please.

37
00:02:29,357 --> 00:02:32,944
That's enough. Don't tell lies in church.

38
00:02:33,027 --> 00:02:35,321
Ma'am, have some respect
for the dead. Please.

39
00:02:35,405 --> 00:02:38,366
Why? Did you respect him
when he was alive?

40
00:02:38,449 --> 00:02:39,868
You! You've never sucked dicks?

41
00:02:39,951 --> 00:02:41,619
-How pathetic.
-Rude.

42
00:02:41,703 --> 00:02:43,371
-Ma'am, let's go.
-What a foul mouth.

43
00:02:43,454 --> 00:02:45,248
-I'm sorry.
-Such a crass lady.

44
00:02:45,331 --> 00:02:46,166
Ma'am.

45
00:02:46,749 --> 00:02:48,960
If it weren't for you,
Otep would still be alive.

46
00:02:49,043 --> 00:02:51,546
We'd still be hitting the club.

47
00:02:52,755 --> 00:02:54,174
Since the day you were born,

48
00:02:54,257 --> 00:02:57,385
you've been killing your father
little by little.

49
00:02:57,468 --> 00:02:58,511
Fuck you!

50
00:03:06,603 --> 00:03:09,272
Ma'am, that's enough.

51
00:03:09,355 --> 00:03:12,066
Have some respect for the dead.
Let's go outside.

52
00:03:12,150 --> 00:03:13,526
That's enough!

53
00:03:13,610 --> 00:03:16,529
-What? Still against gays, huh?
-That's enough, we're in church.

54
00:03:16,613 --> 00:03:20,867
I hope his ghost haunts you,
you damn hypocrites!

55
00:03:46,309 --> 00:03:48,311
Careful. Watch your hands.

56
00:04:38,403 --> 00:04:45,159
I WISH YOU HAD TOLD ME

57
00:05:07,390 --> 00:05:10,059
What are you doing? Turn off the lights.

58
00:05:11,477 --> 00:05:13,396
Did you lock the gate?

59
00:05:15,690 --> 00:05:17,025
It's so humiliating.

60
00:05:17,608 --> 00:05:19,694
So embarrassing for the pastor.

61
00:05:21,237 --> 00:05:22,822
Just pray for your dad.

62
00:05:23,489 --> 00:05:26,326
You know a soul can't go to heaven

63
00:05:26,409 --> 00:05:28,995
if it hasn't been given
a proper blessing, right?

64
00:05:29,078 --> 00:05:32,123
Remember your Aunt Vangie's
cousin's child?

65
00:05:32,623 --> 00:05:36,377
Every night, she's been dreaming
about their soul burning in hell

66
00:05:36,461 --> 00:05:39,380
just because their burial wasn't blessed.

67
00:05:41,507 --> 00:05:42,550
Sweetie.

68
00:05:44,635 --> 00:05:45,678
Seph.

69
00:05:47,221 --> 00:05:49,557
Go visit the pastor, okay?

70
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:54,562
Tell him you didn't know anything,
that it's not true.

71
00:05:55,229 --> 00:05:56,064
What's not true?

72
00:06:00,109 --> 00:06:03,112
What matters now
is that you make it to Portugal.

73
00:06:03,946 --> 00:06:06,115
I don't want to be humiliated anymore.

74
00:06:06,199 --> 00:06:09,202
Let's just pray
that it doesn't affect your mission.

75
00:06:24,967 --> 00:06:26,219
-LOVE YOU, SON
-HOW'S TRAINING?

76
00:06:26,302 --> 00:06:27,595
-YOU GUYS EAT
-SON, TV'S BROKEN

77
00:06:27,678 --> 00:06:29,722
-OK, DAD, I'LL FIX IT LATER
-WHERE ARE YOU, SON?

78
00:06:36,396 --> 00:06:38,398
-OKAY, EAT YOUR MEAL
-WAKE ME UP WHEN YOU'RE HOME

79
00:06:38,481 --> 00:06:40,358
-HOW ARE YOU? YOU OK?
-SON, COME HOME

80
00:06:40,441 --> 00:06:41,984
-I'M SORRY, SON
-I'LL WAIT FOR YOU

81
00:06:42,068 --> 00:06:46,239
DAD, WHO'S CECIL?

82
00:07:17,979 --> 00:07:18,855
Wow.

83
00:07:18,938 --> 00:07:21,357
The princess has finally come out.

84
00:07:21,441 --> 00:07:22,942
You better pay for this.

85
00:07:23,443 --> 00:07:26,112
-So? Have you received a letter?
-Not yet.

86
00:07:26,612 --> 00:07:29,949
Relax, we're just going to the club, okay?

87
00:07:48,801 --> 00:07:50,636
Come on. Let's go.

88
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:51,679
Okay.

89
00:07:53,764 --> 00:07:57,435
Relax. We're just going to the club,
there'll be lots of hot guys there.

90
00:07:57,518 --> 00:08:00,062
-I'm not letting anyone arrest me there.
-Quiet!

91
00:08:00,146 --> 00:08:03,399
Yuck! Over my dead, beautiful body!

92
00:08:03,483 --> 00:08:04,317
Stop it.

93
00:08:13,826 --> 00:08:14,869
Mom.

94
00:08:16,078 --> 00:08:17,246
Mom, let me.

95
00:08:17,788 --> 00:08:20,374
-What's that, Mom?
-Just stuff from your dad's room.

96
00:08:20,458 --> 00:08:24,253
-Some of these can be thrown away.
-Mom, let me. I'll do this.

97
00:08:24,337 --> 00:08:26,839
-You don't have to…
-Please.

98
00:08:27,924 --> 00:08:30,134
We can give some of those away.

99
00:08:30,635 --> 00:08:32,803
You can pack up this bed too.

100
00:08:32,887 --> 00:08:37,975
I'll head out to file
for your dad's pension.

101
00:08:38,059 --> 00:08:40,269
I might be back late.

102
00:08:40,770 --> 00:08:43,481
Deal with that first. Take them to church.

103
00:08:43,564 --> 00:08:47,818
After that, water your dad's plants.
Don't forget.

104
00:08:50,571 --> 00:08:51,948
RHYTHMS OF THE ALHAMBRA

107
00:09:24,981 --> 00:09:26,274
Amen, Holy Lord.

108
00:09:40,913 --> 00:09:43,082
Please guide Paula Mercado,

109
00:09:43,666 --> 00:09:46,335
whom we love dearly,

110
00:09:46,419 --> 00:09:50,256
and hope to deliver from Satan…

111
00:09:53,301 --> 00:09:58,389
And from her sinful desire
of lusting after the same sex.

112
00:09:58,472 --> 00:09:59,307
Amen!

113
00:09:59,390 --> 00:10:03,185
Your love is divine

114
00:10:03,269 --> 00:10:08,149
Your love is faithful

115
00:10:08,232 --> 00:10:13,362
Your love is true

116
00:10:13,446 --> 00:10:18,200
Your love is enough

117
00:10:18,284 --> 00:10:23,497
Your love is divine

118
00:10:23,581 --> 00:10:28,461
Your love is faithful

119
00:10:28,544 --> 00:10:33,341
Your love is true

120
00:10:33,424 --> 00:10:37,887
Your love is enough

121
00:10:43,309 --> 00:10:44,393
Hey, it's the pastor.

122
00:10:44,477 --> 00:10:45,895
-Hi, Pastor.
-Hi, Pastor.

123
00:10:46,854 --> 00:10:49,231
Pastor, good morning.

124
00:10:53,361 --> 00:10:56,906
Pastor, these are some of Dad's clothes.

125
00:10:56,989 --> 00:10:59,659
They might be of some use to the church.

126
00:11:02,536 --> 00:11:04,830
Pastor, I'm begging you.

127
00:11:06,165 --> 00:11:10,086
If you would, please bless my dad.

128
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:12,922
Please have mercy on his soul.

129
00:11:28,813 --> 00:11:32,400
Your evangelical mission
is coming up, and…

130
00:11:34,068 --> 00:11:35,986
You wouldn't want to miss out on that.

131
00:11:36,821 --> 00:11:39,115
But blessing him won't take long.

132
00:11:41,742 --> 00:11:44,203
Uh, Seph…

133
00:11:45,287 --> 00:11:47,707
What you're asking for isn't that simple.

134
00:11:47,790 --> 00:11:50,209
Did you hear
what they were talking about in church?

135
00:11:50,918 --> 00:11:55,923
They all feel betrayed
by your lying father.

136
00:11:56,006 --> 00:11:57,383
Marlon, you know that's not true.

137
00:12:00,219 --> 00:12:04,598
All we're asking from you
is a little compassion.

138
00:12:06,058 --> 00:12:07,852
That's the preaching of our Holy Lord.

139
00:12:09,395 --> 00:12:11,188
Don't take it too hard, son.

140
00:12:16,944 --> 00:12:21,407
Good thing you were at mission training
when your dad's illness was at its worst.

141
00:12:21,907 --> 00:12:24,827
Up until his death.
What was his disease again?

142
00:12:26,704 --> 00:12:27,830
AIDS, right?

143
00:12:31,834 --> 00:12:32,835
Cancer, sir.

144
00:12:43,929 --> 00:12:47,892
Have you donated
the funeral collection to the church?

145
00:12:58,319 --> 00:13:00,905
CECIL DA BISH
WORKS @ CR8Z

146
00:13:06,285 --> 00:13:07,745
Excuse me.

147
00:13:12,875 --> 00:13:14,043
Hello?

148
00:13:16,921 --> 00:13:18,005
Hello?

149
00:13:19,715 --> 00:13:22,802
Excuse me, ma'am. I'm sorry to bother you.

150
00:13:23,844 --> 00:13:26,514
Do you remember where you went last night?

151
00:13:27,765 --> 00:13:29,600
Do I look like a nutjob?

152
00:13:31,727 --> 00:13:34,480
Maybe you went to the wrong place.

153
00:13:35,481 --> 00:13:37,900
My dad died of cancer.

154
00:13:39,276 --> 00:13:42,488
Can you come with me to our church?

155
00:13:43,072 --> 00:13:45,324
So we can explain…

156
00:13:46,450 --> 00:13:47,660
Are you drunk?

157
00:13:47,743 --> 00:13:49,078
No, you are.

158
00:13:49,578 --> 00:13:53,541
Me? You want me to go to your church?

159
00:13:54,291 --> 00:13:55,626
Yuck.

160
00:14:06,262 --> 00:14:08,556
You brat. Give it back!

161
00:14:09,056 --> 00:14:10,057
Give it back.

162
00:14:11,475 --> 00:14:16,021
I'm not dumb enough to show up
at the wake of someone I didn't know.

163
00:14:18,983 --> 00:14:20,860
What's my dad's name, then?

164
00:14:23,696 --> 00:14:24,613
See?

165
00:14:25,114 --> 00:14:28,242
You're even dumber than me.
You don't know your dad's name?

166
00:14:28,325 --> 00:14:30,244
Just admit it.

167
00:14:30,327 --> 00:14:33,289
What are you, a cop? I've changed.

168
00:14:34,665 --> 00:14:35,708
Listen.

169
00:14:36,375 --> 00:14:40,129
You didn't know your dad
the way I knew him.

170
00:14:42,923 --> 00:14:44,216
Got it?

171
00:14:45,342 --> 00:14:47,177
God knows the truth.

172
00:14:48,345 --> 00:14:50,848
We're going around in circles here.

173
00:14:51,348 --> 00:14:53,350
You act like you know everything,

174
00:14:53,934 --> 00:14:56,353
but you didn't know your dad was gay?

175
00:14:57,771 --> 00:15:00,649
Well, now you do.
Am I still the one who messed up?

176
00:15:09,825 --> 00:15:11,035
Fag!

177
00:16:06,131 --> 00:16:07,091
Hello.

WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL ME?

180
00:18:46,542 --> 00:18:47,584
Mom?

181
00:21:18,026 --> 00:21:20,279
Oh, this heat!

182
00:21:20,362 --> 00:21:23,573
Oh, Lord, it's so hot.
I'll take a bath later.

183
00:21:27,119 --> 00:21:28,996
Seph, ignore it.

184
00:21:29,871 --> 00:21:31,790
I'm going to your Auntie Nida's.

185
00:21:32,624 --> 00:21:36,044
I'll stay there for a few days.
Take some time off, get some rest.

186
00:21:36,545 --> 00:21:37,671
Wanna come?

187
00:21:37,754 --> 00:21:39,589
Oh, right, you can't.

188
00:21:40,424 --> 00:21:41,925
Have you spoken to the pastor?

189
00:21:42,509 --> 00:21:43,552
Yes, Mom.

190
00:21:44,261 --> 00:21:45,637
What did he say?

191
00:21:46,138 --> 00:21:48,890
Will it affect your trip to Portugal?

192
00:21:49,725 --> 00:21:50,684
No, Mom.

193
00:21:53,061 --> 00:21:54,062
Thank goodness.

194
00:21:54,146 --> 00:21:57,941
Thank you, Holy Lord. Thank you, Pastor.

195
00:22:06,033 --> 00:22:07,367
Mom, about…

196
00:22:07,868 --> 00:22:09,328
About Cecil…

197
00:22:09,411 --> 00:22:11,246
Oh, come on. Seriously?

198
00:22:11,330 --> 00:22:12,956
That's what's been bugging you?

199
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:14,374
She's nobody, sweetie.

200
00:22:14,458 --> 00:22:18,128
Your dad was a ladies man,
so women were always after him.

201
00:22:18,211 --> 00:22:19,338
Never mind her.

202
00:22:19,421 --> 00:22:21,882
I'm gonna go shower.
I can't take this heat anymore.

203
00:22:23,383 --> 00:22:25,093
I'll clean this up later.

204
00:22:25,177 --> 00:22:28,096
Just put them in the sink.
I'll wash them later. Okay?

205
00:22:28,930 --> 00:22:29,931
Okay?

206
00:22:34,061 --> 00:22:35,103
Marlon.

207
00:22:36,897 --> 00:22:38,023
Hey, Marlon.

208
00:22:39,066 --> 00:22:40,692
I can't help you.

209
00:22:42,361 --> 00:22:44,529
Just hear me out, Marlon. Please.

210
00:22:47,866 --> 00:22:49,284
Seph, you should pray.

211
00:22:49,785 --> 00:22:53,914
Didn't my father help
a lot of people in our church?

212
00:22:54,664 --> 00:22:56,291
-Remember…
-Marlon.

213
00:22:56,375 --> 00:22:59,586
The devil shows himself
when messengers are about to embark.

214
00:23:00,170 --> 00:23:02,589
He'll try to lead us astray
from the Holy Lord.

215
00:23:02,672 --> 00:23:03,715
Honey.

216
00:23:06,259 --> 00:23:07,135
Hey.

217
00:23:07,219 --> 00:23:09,471
Honey, your sister is throwing up again.

218
00:23:09,554 --> 00:23:11,348
-Again?
-Yeah.

219
00:23:11,431 --> 00:23:12,516
Let's go.

220
00:23:14,309 --> 00:23:16,520
What if I don't go to Portugal?

221
00:23:18,939 --> 00:23:19,940
You go ahead.

222
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:21,566
I'll be right there.

223
00:23:26,738 --> 00:23:28,115
What are you talking about?

224
00:23:28,782 --> 00:23:30,909
Don't you feel ashamed
in front of the Holy Lord?

225
00:24:04,568 --> 00:24:06,361
I never would've guessed.

226
00:24:11,533 --> 00:24:14,953
How long have you known my dad?

227
00:24:16,955 --> 00:24:19,875
We've been together since way back when.

228
00:24:24,045 --> 00:24:25,881
We'd go to the club a lot.

229
00:24:28,842 --> 00:24:31,219
And your dad could move those damn hips.

230
00:24:34,764 --> 00:24:35,932
I'm kidding.

231
00:24:37,184 --> 00:24:38,518
Cut me some slack.

232
00:24:40,896 --> 00:24:43,273
Your dad was good at only two things.

233
00:24:45,275 --> 00:24:46,568
First, dancing.

234
00:24:49,821 --> 00:24:51,907
Second, he could keep secrets.

235
00:25:12,177 --> 00:25:14,429
Loosen up. Move those hips. Come on!

236
00:25:14,513 --> 00:25:16,014
-What?
-Like this.

237
00:25:16,097 --> 00:25:17,057
Like that!

238
00:25:18,725 --> 00:25:20,060
Twirl, girl.

239
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:27,734
Stop looking over your shoulder.

240
00:25:27,817 --> 00:25:30,487
Just relax. Like this.

241
00:25:30,570 --> 00:25:31,905
Do it like this.

242
00:25:34,574 --> 00:25:37,077
Come on, darling. Enjoy!

243
00:25:38,578 --> 00:25:40,247
Move your shoulders.

244
00:25:40,330 --> 00:25:42,332
-Shoulders?
-Wanna smoke?

245
00:25:48,964 --> 00:25:50,715
Is he your type? Come here.

246
00:25:50,799 --> 00:25:51,800
-What…?
-Come.

247
00:25:51,883 --> 00:25:53,718
Move!

248
00:26:01,268 --> 00:26:02,352
Ces.

249
00:26:02,894 --> 00:26:05,355
-Hi.
-We're gonna shake hands again?

250
00:26:05,981 --> 00:26:07,774
-What's your name?
-Otep.

251
00:26:07,857 --> 00:26:08,733
Hi, Otep.

252
00:26:41,808 --> 00:26:44,477
Otep, mi amor.

253
00:26:57,324 --> 00:26:59,492
-Excuse me!
-Hey, what the--?

254
00:26:59,993 --> 00:27:01,244
Where are you going?

255
00:27:01,328 --> 00:27:02,662
-Hey!
-Excuse me.

256
00:27:03,622 --> 00:27:07,042
Excuse me.

257
00:27:08,293 --> 00:27:09,461
What's wrong with him?

258
00:27:11,212 --> 00:27:13,423
Does stupidity run in your family?

259
00:27:15,133 --> 00:27:17,135
Have you been watching the news?

260
00:27:17,218 --> 00:27:20,639
Have you seen who
this fucking government is rounding up?

261
00:27:20,722 --> 00:27:24,726
For all we know, you or that hot guy
could be gone tomorrow.

262
00:27:24,809 --> 00:27:26,603
We're running out of time!

263
00:27:26,686 --> 00:27:28,980
Kiss whoever you want
while you still have the chance!

264
00:27:29,064 --> 00:27:30,231
Ces.

265
00:27:32,192 --> 00:27:33,485
Is it possible

266
00:27:34,361 --> 00:27:37,614
to fall in love with a pen pal?

267
00:27:38,615 --> 00:27:40,283
You're impossible.

268
00:27:40,367 --> 00:27:42,410
You've been pen pals with him
since God-knows-when,

269
00:27:42,494 --> 00:27:43,578
yet nothing's happened.

270
00:27:43,662 --> 00:27:45,580
You're still a virgin.

271
00:27:45,664 --> 00:27:49,376
You know what? You have
a better chance hooking up with that cutie

272
00:27:49,459 --> 00:27:53,171
than with that Spanish guy of yours.

273
00:27:56,675 --> 00:27:58,051
He'd sneak out.

274
00:27:59,010 --> 00:28:01,638
He would still visit me from time to time.

275
00:28:03,348 --> 00:28:04,307
He was stubborn.

276
00:28:07,602 --> 00:28:11,481
We were the only ones
who understood each other.

277
00:28:18,029 --> 00:28:19,614
That man loved me.

278
00:28:20,865 --> 00:28:22,617
Despite who I am.

279
00:28:26,496 --> 00:28:29,499
People like your father

280
00:28:31,126 --> 00:28:33,378
are the ones who should be in Heaven.

281
00:28:35,505 --> 00:28:38,091
Not like those people in your church.

282
00:28:43,930 --> 00:28:47,267
Well, darling,
so what if your dad was gay?

283
00:28:48,727 --> 00:28:50,812
Did he love you any less?

284
00:28:51,312 --> 00:28:52,772
He didn't, did he?

285
00:28:53,815 --> 00:28:55,734
He loved you so much.

286
00:29:29,726 --> 00:29:34,397
1 Corinthians 13:4-7.

287
00:29:35,815 --> 00:29:39,235
"A person who loves perseveres,

288
00:29:40,236 --> 00:29:42,447
always trusts,

289
00:29:42,947 --> 00:29:45,074
always hopes,

290
00:29:46,284 --> 00:29:47,911
always bears everything."

291
00:29:49,871 --> 00:29:52,081
What the fuck?

292
00:29:53,500 --> 00:29:54,834
You really are stupid.

293
00:29:54,918 --> 00:29:59,047
Delusional, masochist, faggot!

294
00:29:59,130 --> 00:30:03,551
You just found a pen pal in the papers,
and now you're in love? Dumbass!

295
00:30:03,635 --> 00:30:06,221
You can't even dance.
Your shoulders are stiff as hell!

296
00:30:14,729 --> 00:30:17,065
Where on earth did you find this?

297
00:30:20,068 --> 00:30:23,738
Gosh. This is what irked me
about your dad.

298
00:30:24,239 --> 00:30:26,616
Always going on about
"Love is this, love is that,"

299
00:30:26,699 --> 00:30:28,451
throwing in Bible quotes and everything.

300
00:30:28,535 --> 00:30:31,287
Gosh, if you only knew.

301
00:30:34,457 --> 00:30:40,046
C. Fray Albina, 7, 14439 Algallarín,

302
00:30:40,129 --> 00:30:42,048
Córdoba, Spain.

303
00:30:42,131 --> 00:30:44,300
See? I still remember it.

304
00:30:44,384 --> 00:30:47,554
Otep was supposed
to go see his man in Spain.

305
00:30:47,637 --> 00:30:51,224
So he saved up, prayed day and night.

306
00:30:52,308 --> 00:30:56,354
Delusional, masochist, toxic!

307
00:30:57,063 --> 00:30:58,439
-Gosh!
-Here.

308
00:30:58,940 --> 00:31:00,191
I'll wear this.

309
00:31:01,734 --> 00:31:04,445
I heard it's cold there.
How do I look, Ces?

310
00:31:04,529 --> 00:31:05,530
Let me see.

311
00:31:06,281 --> 00:31:07,991
It fits!

312
00:31:08,074 --> 00:31:10,118
Your outfit needs these.

313
00:31:10,201 --> 00:31:12,078
-What?
-Put these on.

314
00:31:12,161 --> 00:31:14,080
Wear these. There.

315
00:31:14,914 --> 00:31:16,165
Looking fresh!

316
00:31:16,249 --> 00:31:17,917
Yeah, fresh from the dumpster.

317
00:31:22,046 --> 00:31:23,172
Ces.

318
00:31:24,549 --> 00:31:30,513
I promise I'll write to you every day
until you get sick of me.

319
00:31:31,347 --> 00:31:33,391
I'm already sick of you.

320
00:31:34,142 --> 00:31:35,810
-Get lost.
-Ouch.

321
00:31:36,477 --> 00:31:39,188
Hey. Just find yourself a boyfriend.

322
00:31:39,689 --> 00:31:42,942
-You've got so many admirers, right?
-Fine, let me just kiss you.

323
00:31:44,527 --> 00:31:46,154
Consider it practice.

324
00:31:46,237 --> 00:31:50,366
Of course, you'll be smooched
by your lover boy from now on.

325
00:31:55,163 --> 00:31:56,998
Why won't you just stay?

326
00:31:59,500 --> 00:32:02,253
-I'm gonna tear this up.
-Hey, don't.

327
00:32:04,422 --> 00:32:06,215
Hey, stop worrying.

328
00:32:06,716 --> 00:32:08,092
I'm gonna miss you.

329
00:32:18,603 --> 00:32:24,692
And now, it's time for us
to listen to spiritual declarations.

330
00:32:33,368 --> 00:32:35,244
Perhaps you'd like to take the lead?

331
00:33:00,395 --> 00:33:04,190
"The past week has not been easy for me."

332
00:33:06,484 --> 00:33:11,572
"As it says in 1 Corinthians 10:13,

333
00:33:12,448 --> 00:33:16,285
'No temptation has overtaken you
except what is common to mankind.'"

334
00:33:17,036 --> 00:33:19,455
"That's why I feel grateful to all of you,

335
00:33:19,539 --> 00:33:21,416
especially to you…"

336
00:33:26,921 --> 00:33:28,798
ESPECIALLY TO YOU, PASTOR LEO

337
00:33:33,761 --> 00:33:35,596
Dad showed this to us.

338
00:33:36,347 --> 00:33:37,807
He was everyone's refuge.

339
00:33:37,890 --> 00:33:42,687
He never judged
nor thought badly of anyone.

340
00:33:44,439 --> 00:33:50,486
Every day, he would remind me
of 1 Corinthians 13:4-7.

341
00:33:51,070 --> 00:33:54,741
"A person who loves perseveres,

342
00:33:54,824 --> 00:33:57,035
always trusts…

343
00:34:01,748 --> 00:34:03,583
always hopes…

344
00:34:06,669 --> 00:34:07,837
bears everything."

345
00:34:10,882 --> 00:34:14,761
May we live as examples
of the teachings of our Holy Lord.

346
00:34:32,904 --> 00:34:36,657
You there, go home.
Otherwise, you'll have to come with us.

347
00:34:46,125 --> 00:34:47,126
Otep!

348
00:34:48,336 --> 00:34:49,921
What's this in your room?

349
00:35:08,356 --> 00:35:10,817
This won't take long. I'll just show you.

350
00:35:10,900 --> 00:35:13,236
I'll just show you this video game, okay?

351
00:35:19,784 --> 00:35:24,163
Your sister is volunteering
to become my assistant.

352
00:35:24,247 --> 00:35:25,081
Right, sister?

353
00:35:25,164 --> 00:35:26,833
While you're away…

354
00:35:26,916 --> 00:35:27,917
Are you okay?

355
00:35:28,459 --> 00:35:31,337
Such a good kid.
I hope more members take after you.

356
00:35:32,755 --> 00:35:33,756
Sit down.

357
00:35:34,423 --> 00:35:36,217
Oh, by the way.

358
00:35:36,801 --> 00:35:40,429
Congratulations.
You're on your way to Portugal.

359
00:35:42,348 --> 00:35:43,349
There.

360
00:35:43,975 --> 00:35:49,647
In two to three weeks,
you'll receive an email about your posts.

361
00:35:50,398 --> 00:35:54,569
We need to secure the budget
for the regional congregation.

362
00:35:54,652 --> 00:35:57,321
So make sure nothing goes wrong.
Is that clear?

363
00:35:57,989 --> 00:35:59,073
Go now.

364
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:05,830
And don't let
the devil's influence reach you.

365
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:14,088
Look, I kept this.
Good thing it's still in one piece.

366
00:36:17,592 --> 00:36:18,509
What's this?

367
00:36:20,011 --> 00:36:24,015
Your dad asked me
to send this to his man in Spain.

368
00:36:24,098 --> 00:36:26,726
But he changed his mind all of a sudden.

369
00:36:27,226 --> 00:36:29,770
Hey! Leave it. Don't open it.

370
00:36:30,438 --> 00:36:31,772
Don't open it.

371
00:36:31,856 --> 00:36:33,274
That's Rum's.

372
00:36:34,442 --> 00:36:35,943
What are you gonna do?

373
00:36:36,777 --> 00:36:37,987
You gonna read it?

374
00:36:39,697 --> 00:36:41,282
Or are you gonna send it?

375
00:36:43,701 --> 00:36:45,661
Don't tell me you're going to see him.

376
00:36:46,287 --> 00:36:47,413
Seph, I'm telling you.

377
00:36:48,372 --> 00:36:50,333
Does stupidity really run in your family?

378
00:36:50,416 --> 00:36:51,834
I won't read it.

379
00:36:51,918 --> 00:36:53,753
The Holy Lord will be upset.

380
00:36:54,879 --> 00:36:56,589
I won't read it, I promise.

381
00:36:58,633 --> 00:37:01,719
It's just the two of us here,
and you still think you can fool me?

382
00:37:02,762 --> 00:37:03,763
Dumbass!

383
00:37:38,965 --> 00:37:41,092
WHAT SHOULD I DO, DAD?

384
00:37:41,175 --> 00:37:44,762
DO YOU WANT ME TO FIND RUM, DAD?

385
00:38:01,279 --> 00:38:04,073
DAD
COME DOWNSTAIRS, SON

386
00:38:12,039 --> 00:38:14,375
COME DOWNSTAIRS, SON

387
00:38:38,316 --> 00:38:39,150
Seph.

388
00:38:40,318 --> 00:38:41,152
Sit.

389
00:38:41,235 --> 00:38:42,570
Come here, quick.

390
00:38:43,070 --> 00:38:44,322
You'll like this.

391
00:38:46,032 --> 00:38:46,866
Here.

392
00:38:49,410 --> 00:38:50,453
Come here.

393
00:38:55,124 --> 00:38:56,459
It's my favorite tie.

394
00:38:56,959 --> 00:38:58,669
Do you know how to tie this?

395
00:39:06,010 --> 00:39:06,927
Dad…

396
00:39:08,554 --> 00:39:10,389
I know, I know…

397
00:39:11,057 --> 00:39:14,935
Fine, I'll go see a doctor.

398
00:39:15,019 --> 00:39:17,313
Don't worry, I'll live.

399
00:39:27,365 --> 00:39:29,450
What's with that face, Seph?

400
00:39:32,036 --> 00:39:32,912
Seph?

401
00:39:33,621 --> 00:39:35,539
Huh? What's wrong, son?

402
00:39:36,040 --> 00:39:37,958
Why are you looking at me like that?

403
00:39:39,543 --> 00:39:40,419
Dad…

404
00:39:41,629 --> 00:39:43,381
Seph, you can tell Dad.

405
00:39:47,843 --> 00:39:48,761
Son?

406
00:39:55,226 --> 00:39:57,019
What should I do, Dad?

407
00:40:04,026 --> 00:40:08,656
If you see him, tell him I'm sorry. Okay?

408
00:40:13,911 --> 00:40:14,870
Who?

409
00:40:20,626 --> 00:40:23,879
I couldn't reach him then.

410
00:40:23,963 --> 00:40:27,049
Hopefully, he'll feel it
through the letter.

411
00:40:37,268 --> 00:40:38,352
Dad…

412
00:40:39,395 --> 00:40:41,355
Why did you choose me over Rum?

413
00:40:45,818 --> 00:40:47,153
Oh, dear.

414
00:40:50,364 --> 00:40:54,493
Dad. Stay here, Dad. Don't go.

415
00:40:59,039 --> 00:41:00,082
Stay here.

416
00:41:00,583 --> 00:41:03,502
Seph…

417
00:41:04,003 --> 00:41:05,546
Seph…

418
00:41:05,629 --> 00:41:08,966
Seph, I never went away.

419
00:41:09,049 --> 00:41:11,093
Don't go. Please, don't go.

420
00:41:11,177 --> 00:41:12,887
It's okay, son. Don't cry.

421
00:41:22,938 --> 00:41:26,442
Stay with me, Dad. Don't go, please.

422
00:41:26,525 --> 00:41:27,693
Please?

423
00:41:51,258 --> 00:41:53,844
WE JUST LANDED, DAD.

424
00:42:03,437 --> 00:42:05,147
BIBLE

425
00:42:05,773 --> 00:42:07,650
LOVE

426
00:42:11,820 --> 00:42:12,655
Seph.

427
00:42:13,405 --> 00:42:14,240
Seph.

428
00:42:15,032 --> 00:42:16,200
Sorry, coming.

429
00:42:56,740 --> 00:42:57,575
Seph.

430
00:43:08,502 --> 00:43:09,420
Your phone.

431
00:43:25,185 --> 00:43:26,020
Dad…

432
00:43:27,521 --> 00:43:29,523
We're here in Portugal.

433
00:43:31,108 --> 00:43:32,610
I'm almost in Spain.

434
00:43:35,321 --> 00:43:36,989
I'll find him soon.

435
00:43:38,407 --> 00:43:39,241
Rum.

436
00:43:40,993 --> 00:43:42,494
I'm excited, Dad.

437
00:43:50,044 --> 00:43:53,714
HIRING: ENGLISH TEACHER

438
00:43:57,718 --> 00:43:59,261
I still don't know how,

439
00:44:00,262 --> 00:44:01,930
but I'll find a way.

440
00:44:02,014 --> 00:44:03,724
NAZARÉ, PORTUGAL TO CÓRDOBA, SPAIN

441
00:44:15,986 --> 00:44:17,613
I feel scared too.

442
00:44:20,032 --> 00:44:23,452
But now, my faith
is stronger than my fear.

443
00:44:27,873 --> 00:44:29,958
I know I can find him for you.

444
00:44:32,920 --> 00:44:33,754
Dad,

445
00:44:34,713 --> 00:44:35,881
hang in there.

446
00:44:36,382 --> 00:44:37,800
I'm almost there.

447
00:44:45,099 --> 00:44:46,392
MISS YOU, DAD

448
00:45:08,914 --> 00:45:09,790
What's wrong?

449
00:45:10,999 --> 00:45:11,834
What?

450
00:45:12,876 --> 00:45:14,253
You look like you saw a ghost.

451
00:45:19,925 --> 00:45:21,593
Marlon, how…

452
00:45:23,053 --> 00:45:25,681
How much is our allowance again?

453
00:45:26,390 --> 00:45:27,307
Why do you ask?

454
00:45:30,769 --> 00:45:31,603
No reason.

455
00:45:37,317 --> 00:45:38,485
Take this.

456
00:45:41,530 --> 00:45:44,491
Call your mom. But…

457
00:45:45,325 --> 00:45:46,994
we can only call twice a week.

458
00:46:05,554 --> 00:46:10,267
MISS YOU, SON. HOW ARE YOU?
HAVE YOU DELIVERED MY LETTER?

459
00:46:41,840 --> 00:46:44,968
What took you so long? I'm dying in here.

460
00:46:46,220 --> 00:46:48,472
Look at you, all dressed up to the nines.

461
00:47:00,859 --> 00:47:01,693
He's gone.

462
00:47:02,194 --> 00:47:04,404
Damn you, woman!

463
00:47:06,114 --> 00:47:07,783
You're unbelievable.

464
00:47:10,869 --> 00:47:11,703
Here.

465
00:47:12,830 --> 00:47:14,957
Put this on. It's for you.

466
00:47:21,880 --> 00:47:25,008
This is so beautiful, darling.

467
00:47:25,509 --> 00:47:27,928
I really love the colors.

468
00:47:33,725 --> 00:47:37,646
-You know, this'd look even better if…
-Huh?

469
00:47:38,272 --> 00:47:39,356
…you try it on.

470
00:47:39,439 --> 00:47:41,525
-What? No! I don't want to.
-Try it on!

471
00:47:41,608 --> 00:47:44,945
You know, all the queens wear these.

472
00:47:45,028 --> 00:47:47,447
-Come on--
-I said no!

473
00:48:06,842 --> 00:48:10,596
RAFAEL PEÑA, 7 FRAY ALBINA STREET,
ALGALLARÍN, CÓRDOBA, SPAIN

474
00:48:12,764 --> 00:48:16,018
I'll drop this at the post office
right away. Give it to me.

475
00:48:21,023 --> 00:48:22,149
Ces…

476
00:48:24,693 --> 00:48:27,446
Could you hold on to it a bit longer?

477
00:48:28,864 --> 00:48:30,198
Just for a little while.

478
00:48:31,325 --> 00:48:33,201
I'll tell you when to send it.

479
00:48:36,413 --> 00:48:37,956
Just keep it for now.

480
00:48:51,970 --> 00:48:54,222
-Auntie.
-Yes, darling?

481
00:48:54,765 --> 00:48:57,768
Why didn't Dad send his last letter?

482
00:48:58,268 --> 00:48:59,770
'Cause he was delusional.

483
00:48:59,853 --> 00:49:02,689
He knew that if he sent it,
Rum would stop writing.

484
00:49:02,773 --> 00:49:06,944
He was scared Rum would never
feel the same way about him.

485
00:49:07,444 --> 00:49:09,988
I told him, "He's just a pen pal."

486
00:49:10,072 --> 00:49:12,491
"Not meeting him won't kill you."

487
00:49:13,367 --> 00:49:15,869
But I guess that killed him in the end.

488
00:49:17,287 --> 00:49:18,121
Uh…

489
00:49:21,458 --> 00:49:22,876
I'll book a ticket.

490
00:49:24,086 --> 00:49:25,545
I'm gonna find Rum.

491
00:49:25,629 --> 00:49:27,631
Son of a bitch!

492
00:49:28,131 --> 00:49:29,549
Are you nuts?

493
00:49:33,220 --> 00:49:34,930
How? You'll be on your own.

494
00:49:36,807 --> 00:49:38,850
Did you request a transfer
without telling me?

495
00:49:39,518 --> 00:49:40,811
No, I didn't.

496
00:49:40,894 --> 00:49:44,564
Are you sure?
You can't transfer without a companion.

497
00:49:44,648 --> 00:49:47,150
-Is there something you're not telling me?
-Yes.

498
00:49:47,234 --> 00:49:49,236
-Seriously.
-Why should I tell you?

499
00:49:49,319 --> 00:49:51,989
I'm worried.
Can you take care of yourself in Spain?

500
00:49:54,282 --> 00:49:55,784
You're so serious.

501
00:49:55,867 --> 00:49:58,412
-Well, I'm worried.
-I can do this, man.

502
00:50:01,206 --> 00:50:02,332
Hurry up, then.

503
00:50:03,750 --> 00:50:05,377
We'll leave early tomorrow.

504
00:50:06,962 --> 00:50:08,547
I'll get my ticket at the station.

505
00:50:08,630 --> 00:50:11,008
Hey, wait. Marlon.

506
00:50:11,508 --> 00:50:14,094
-What are you doing?
-What do you think I'm doing?

507
00:50:14,177 --> 00:50:16,138
They're strict
about following the handbook.

508
00:50:16,221 --> 00:50:20,851
We share one phone. What if you get lost?

509
00:50:22,394 --> 00:50:26,732
I'll stay with you until you meet
your new coordinator or companion.

510
00:50:30,527 --> 00:50:33,321
But, Marlon, what about the mission head?

511
00:50:35,532 --> 00:50:37,117
You just spoke to him, didn't you?

512
00:50:38,744 --> 00:50:39,828
Right.

513
00:51:32,923 --> 00:51:34,341
Dibs on this one.

514
00:52:01,076 --> 00:52:02,160
Thank you.

515
00:52:04,162 --> 00:52:05,372
Drive safe.

516
00:52:14,673 --> 00:52:16,174
-Hello.
-Hello, Auntie.

517
00:52:16,258 --> 00:52:17,467
Yes, darling?

518
00:52:17,551 --> 00:52:19,094
I'm here at Rum's.

519
00:52:20,053 --> 00:52:21,513
This is the right address, right?

520
00:52:21,596 --> 00:52:25,976
"7 Fray Albina Street, 14439,

521
00:52:26,059 --> 00:52:29,020
Algallarín, Córdoba, Spain."

522
00:52:29,521 --> 00:52:32,816
Fuck. You made it? Is he still alive?

523
00:52:33,441 --> 00:52:34,776
Holy shit.

524
00:52:35,986 --> 00:52:37,529
I don't know. It's like…

525
00:52:38,238 --> 00:52:39,865
It's like there's no one here.

526
00:52:40,490 --> 00:52:42,784
So what now? Are we just gonna chat here?

527
00:52:42,868 --> 00:52:46,454
Tell me if that Rum guy
actually exists. Okay?

528
00:52:48,165 --> 00:52:49,666
Okay. Hang on.

529
00:52:50,959 --> 00:52:52,419
I wonder what he looks like now.

530
00:53:37,589 --> 00:53:40,634
Dad, I've arrived.

531
00:53:41,509 --> 00:53:42,719
And, yes,

532
00:53:44,304 --> 00:53:48,558
everything Rum said
in all those letters is true.

533
00:53:50,018 --> 00:53:54,981
It's like all your memories
are alive in every corner of this place.

534
00:53:55,649 --> 00:53:58,401
Even though I know
you never made it to Spain.

535
00:54:05,116 --> 00:54:06,785
It feels like a dream.

536
00:54:09,371 --> 00:54:12,082
I see the world Rum promised you.

537
00:54:12,874 --> 00:54:13,959
It's quiet.

538
00:54:14,709 --> 00:54:15,835
Free.

539
00:54:19,214 --> 00:54:22,717
It's as if the photos buried long ago
have come back to life.

540
00:54:35,897 --> 00:54:37,440
What if you had made it here?

541
00:54:39,567 --> 00:54:41,236
What if you and Rum had met?

542
00:54:44,406 --> 00:54:47,534
Maybe your heart would've been at peace.

543
00:55:07,929 --> 00:55:09,431
Here. Eat this.

544
00:55:29,451 --> 00:55:32,954
DAD, DOES RUM STILL LIVE THERE?

545
00:55:35,498 --> 00:55:37,625
I HAVE LOTS TO TELL YOU, DAD

546
00:55:45,008 --> 00:55:46,384
Where is everybody?

547
00:55:47,177 --> 00:55:48,261
Siesta.

548
00:55:49,429 --> 00:55:52,891
If this was the Philippines,
kids would be outside playing.

549
00:55:52,974 --> 00:55:55,435
But here, it feels like
people hide from the sun.

550
00:55:55,518 --> 00:55:58,646
Well, what if we split up?

551
00:55:59,272 --> 00:56:01,775
So we can cover more…

552
00:56:02,359 --> 00:56:04,402
-You know.
-We can't.

553
00:56:06,654 --> 00:56:07,655
Come on.

554
00:56:08,573 --> 00:56:10,533
I'm not a child,
I can take care of myself.

555
00:56:11,868 --> 00:56:12,744
Fine.

556
00:56:14,120 --> 00:56:15,038
Can you do it?

557
00:56:17,207 --> 00:56:18,166
I'll handle this.

558
00:56:20,543 --> 00:56:22,670
Sir! Hello, sir!

559
00:56:24,422 --> 00:56:25,673
No. I don't speak English.

560
00:56:36,309 --> 00:56:37,268
-Let's go.
-Hey.

561
00:56:38,061 --> 00:56:40,146
-Did you really have to say that?
-Why? It's true.

562
00:56:41,898 --> 00:56:43,400
-Hola.
-Yes?

563
00:56:46,945 --> 00:56:48,822
-No.
-No problema.

564
00:56:48,905 --> 00:56:49,864
Gracias.

565
00:56:55,453 --> 00:56:56,329
Come on.

566
00:57:01,334 --> 00:57:02,293
Oh, look.

567
00:57:02,377 --> 00:57:04,462
There's a park 15 minutes away.

568
00:57:05,672 --> 00:57:06,965
It should be busy.

569
00:57:07,715 --> 00:57:10,510
Marlon, wait up.

570
00:57:11,010 --> 00:57:13,763
Hold on. I think I dropped my pamphlet.

571
00:57:13,847 --> 00:57:16,391
You go ahead, I'll meet you there.

572
00:57:16,474 --> 00:57:17,559
I won't be long.

573
00:57:27,819 --> 00:57:29,529
Señor?

574
00:57:31,030 --> 00:57:33,575
I already told you, I'm not interested.

575
00:57:40,123 --> 00:57:41,082
What?

576
00:57:42,083 --> 00:57:42,959
What?

577
00:57:54,220 --> 00:57:55,763
Go to hell.

578
00:58:00,018 --> 00:58:02,145
Señor. Sorry.

579
00:58:11,988 --> 00:58:13,490
Seph, where are you going?

580
00:59:33,987 --> 00:59:35,655
Run, mi amor.

581
00:59:58,428 --> 01:00:02,473
FRIENDS OF THE PATIOS
OF CÓRDOBA ASSOCIATION

582
01:00:30,585 --> 01:00:31,419
What's your--?

583
01:00:31,502 --> 01:00:33,796
Do you want to go back
to your country in a box?

584
01:00:33,880 --> 01:00:34,922
What?

585
01:00:35,006 --> 01:00:37,300
-Get out of here.
-Rafael!

586
01:00:37,383 --> 01:00:39,135
I don't speak Spanish.

587
01:00:39,218 --> 01:00:41,095
Don't touch my orchids!

588
01:00:41,179 --> 01:00:42,889
Just leave. Rafael.

589
01:00:42,972 --> 01:00:45,058
-What's his problem?
-Leave, please.

590
01:00:50,396 --> 01:00:52,565
Tour… Yes.

591
01:00:55,151 --> 01:00:56,027
Yes.

592
01:00:58,321 --> 01:01:00,531
Yes, Filipino!

593
01:01:09,791 --> 01:01:14,003
-Yes.
-He's the owner of this orchid.

594
01:01:14,087 --> 01:01:16,339
Yes. Thank you. Sorry.

595
01:01:25,306 --> 01:01:26,182
Seph.

596
01:01:28,851 --> 01:01:31,145
Marlon. I found it.

597
01:01:32,355 --> 01:01:34,232
Let's go.

598
01:01:34,732 --> 01:01:35,733
Marlon, come on.

599
01:01:37,151 --> 01:01:39,070
Did you study the handbook?

600
01:01:39,696 --> 01:01:44,367
Whether you like it or not,
we'll be together 24/7 for three years.

601
01:01:46,577 --> 01:01:49,163
Hey. Are you even listening?

602
01:01:49,997 --> 01:01:50,832
Huh?

603
01:01:53,042 --> 01:01:54,669
I said, are you listening?

604
01:01:55,294 --> 01:01:56,295
Yeah.

605
01:02:05,430 --> 01:02:07,890
Didn't I tell you not to go there?

606
01:02:19,819 --> 01:02:23,656
DAD, I FINALLY FOUND RUM!

607
01:02:48,264 --> 01:02:50,224
YOU HAVEN'T GIVEN IT TO HIM?
GO SEE RUM

608
01:02:50,308 --> 01:02:53,102
I'M RUNNING OUT OF TIME, SON

609
01:03:38,022 --> 01:03:39,482
Sir, hola.

610
01:03:49,408 --> 01:03:50,910
Yes, Catholic.

611
01:04:01,963 --> 01:04:03,130
-No!
-Yes.

612
01:04:07,468 --> 01:04:09,387
He died of cancer!

613
01:04:15,893 --> 01:04:16,811
Dammit.

614
01:04:17,562 --> 01:04:19,355
I was talking nicely!

615
01:04:44,213 --> 01:04:45,506
Dammit.

616
01:05:06,068 --> 01:05:07,528
Damn, you have lots of meds.

617
01:05:38,809 --> 01:05:40,519
Could've been a mild stroke.

618
01:05:57,453 --> 01:05:58,913
Yes?

619
01:06:03,960 --> 01:06:07,129
I'd rather die
than thank an idiot like you.

620
01:06:35,116 --> 01:06:36,409
Idiot.

621
01:07:59,825 --> 01:08:00,910
Where have you been?

622
01:08:09,293 --> 01:08:10,544
Give me the money.

623
01:08:11,378 --> 01:08:13,339
I've spent all of it.

624
01:08:14,882 --> 01:08:15,966
All of it?

625
01:08:18,552 --> 01:08:20,054
Seph, I need that.

626
01:08:22,932 --> 01:08:24,934
Give it back. Is it here?

627
01:08:25,017 --> 01:08:26,393
It's gone. I spent it.

628
01:08:26,477 --> 01:08:29,897
-Marlon, what are you doing?
-I need that money.

629
01:08:30,731 --> 01:08:32,191
I said, it's gone.

630
01:08:38,072 --> 01:08:39,115
What's this?

631
01:08:41,992 --> 01:08:43,994
This is why we're in Spain?

632
01:08:46,539 --> 01:08:48,374
Nobody told you to come with me.

633
01:08:49,458 --> 01:08:50,751
Give it back.

634
01:08:51,377 --> 01:08:53,462
I said, give it back!

635
01:08:57,341 --> 01:08:58,175
What?

636
01:08:59,718 --> 01:09:01,554
Are you gonna report me to the pastor?

637
01:09:02,972 --> 01:09:04,557
That motherfucking pastor!

638
01:09:22,491 --> 01:09:23,742
This is my fault.

639
01:09:25,911 --> 01:09:28,164
I shouldn't have come here.

640
01:09:29,874 --> 01:09:31,834
You can go home if you want.

641
01:09:49,101 --> 01:09:50,519
My sister's pregnant, Seph.

642
01:09:52,938 --> 01:09:55,191
Michelle's only 16.

643
01:10:03,741 --> 01:10:05,743
That's why I need the money.

644
01:10:06,535 --> 01:10:10,956
I need to work
to support her while she's pregnant.

645
01:10:13,417 --> 01:10:15,085
That goddamn pastor.

646
01:10:17,254 --> 01:10:19,089
I'm pretty sure

647
01:10:20,424 --> 01:10:24,762
that damn pastor won't take responsibility
for what he did to my sister.

648
01:10:35,856 --> 01:10:40,444
Seph, I don't even know
what kind of prayer to say now.

649
01:10:41,445 --> 01:10:43,239
He's got us by the neck.

650
01:10:44,448 --> 01:10:47,243
Our house, our livelihood…

651
01:10:47,993 --> 01:10:50,829
We don't have a life
outside the Church anymore.

652
01:10:55,751 --> 01:10:57,419
This is my fault.

653
01:10:59,713 --> 01:11:01,048
I didn't do anything.

654
01:11:01,674 --> 01:11:02,591
I couldn't…

655
01:11:03,092 --> 01:11:05,386
I couldn't protect her, Seph.

656
01:11:16,730 --> 01:11:18,816
He screwed us all, Marlon.

657
01:11:23,195 --> 01:11:26,824
But that doesn't mean we won't fight back.

658
01:11:31,495 --> 01:11:33,122
Will that change anything?

659
01:11:39,336 --> 01:11:41,380
What do you plan to do with that letter?

660
01:11:43,632 --> 01:11:45,592
I'm not going home until…

661
01:11:47,011 --> 01:11:48,595
I deliver this to Rum.

662
01:11:51,432 --> 01:11:52,725
For Dad.

663
01:12:07,948 --> 01:12:08,824
Hola.

664
01:12:10,451 --> 01:12:13,287
-The restaurant is there…
-I'm interested. The job?

665
01:12:13,370 --> 01:12:15,497
-Interested in the restaurant job?
-Job.

666
01:12:15,581 --> 01:12:18,459
Do you have any experience waiting tables?

667
01:12:25,966 --> 01:12:26,967
Sweetie,

668
01:12:27,593 --> 01:12:31,263
your mission head and the entire church
have been looking for you.

669
01:12:32,139 --> 01:12:34,892
Marlon's not picking up either.

670
01:12:35,476 --> 01:12:37,186
Is Dad there, Mom?

671
01:12:37,686 --> 01:12:40,230
My God, Seph, don't scare me like that.

672
01:12:40,314 --> 01:12:43,817
I've been wanting to leave this house.
Where are you?

673
01:12:44,318 --> 01:12:45,486
Come home, sweetie.

674
01:12:45,569 --> 01:12:48,322
Mom, why did you marry Dad?

675
01:12:48,822 --> 01:12:50,699
Why are you changing the subject?

676
01:12:51,200 --> 01:12:53,952
What's going on with you, Joseph? Huh?

677
01:13:03,462 --> 01:13:04,797
-Hola.
-Goddammit.

678
01:13:04,880 --> 01:13:07,716
Sir! How are you?

679
01:13:18,477 --> 01:13:20,562
I have brought…

680
01:13:21,063 --> 01:13:23,816
I have brought food.

681
01:13:24,316 --> 01:13:28,278
In case you are…

682
01:13:30,948 --> 01:13:33,534
hungry.

683
01:13:58,016 --> 01:13:59,184
Idiot!

684
01:14:01,478 --> 01:14:03,647
I have salmorejo.

685
01:14:04,440 --> 01:14:06,316
My ass!

686
01:14:56,074 --> 01:14:57,618
Where…

687
01:14:59,119 --> 01:15:00,537
Where…

688
01:15:00,621 --> 01:15:01,705
Use English.

689
01:15:15,469 --> 01:15:16,762
Yes.

690
01:15:17,262 --> 01:15:19,264
Gracias.

691
01:15:30,734 --> 01:15:32,861
Hey, this seems pretty far.

692
01:15:53,507 --> 01:15:58,136
And idiots like you go to the cities.

693
01:17:57,214 --> 01:17:58,423
Like love.

694
01:18:00,425 --> 01:18:01,927
Like love.

695
01:18:15,982 --> 01:18:18,819
This salmorejo, is…

696
01:18:18,902 --> 01:18:20,529
"muy bueno."

697
01:18:21,697 --> 01:18:23,365
"Muy bueno."

698
01:18:24,449 --> 01:18:28,787
Tu salmorejo… Your salmorejo… Not good.

699
01:18:29,454 --> 01:18:30,872
It's crap.

700
01:18:45,971 --> 01:18:48,140
-"Lleno."
-"Lleno."

701
01:18:48,223 --> 01:18:49,850
Lleno de mierda.

702
01:18:57,190 --> 01:18:58,316
You're nuts.

703
01:19:13,623 --> 01:19:15,500
The simpa.

704
01:19:20,714 --> 01:19:23,759
Rafael! He's doing it again!
Who's paying this check?

705
01:19:28,430 --> 01:19:31,850
It's just a joke.

706
01:19:33,268 --> 01:19:34,436
Now! Let's go!

707
01:19:37,564 --> 01:19:39,191
Look at him.

708
01:19:42,277 --> 01:19:43,612
Some flowers?

709
01:19:44,237 --> 01:19:45,071
Flowers?

710
01:19:45,947 --> 01:19:48,408
In the Philippines,
we call that "one-two-three."

711
01:19:48,492 --> 01:19:49,534
Eat and run.

712
01:19:53,997 --> 01:19:55,540
This old guy's so slow.

713
01:20:13,892 --> 01:20:16,478
What do you mean, "you're old"?
Well, I'm young!

714
01:21:00,522 --> 01:21:01,648
Chains.

715
01:21:28,675 --> 01:21:30,343
JOSEPH MARIANO
RAFAEL PEÑA

716
01:23:11,569 --> 01:23:13,989
Thank you, idiot.

717
01:24:25,101 --> 01:24:25,935
Seph.

718
01:24:50,251 --> 01:24:51,669
Did you give it to him?

719
01:24:53,129 --> 01:24:54,089
Dad.

720
01:25:00,720 --> 01:25:02,222
Why are you doing that?

721
01:25:03,807 --> 01:25:05,308
It feels…

722
01:25:07,185 --> 01:25:09,395
as if there's something wrong with me.

723
01:25:10,772 --> 01:25:12,398
Something I have to fix.

724
01:25:13,274 --> 01:25:15,235
But that's not the real you, is it?

725
01:25:17,821 --> 01:25:20,365
Why would you let them decide for you?

726
01:25:22,826 --> 01:25:26,538
I chose to live
the only way I knew how to.

727
01:25:31,793 --> 01:25:32,919
I'm sorry, Dad.

728
01:25:36,339 --> 01:25:40,552
Maybe if you hadn't
forced yourself to be a father to me…

729
01:25:42,554 --> 01:25:44,430
you would have probably been happier.

730
01:25:50,562 --> 01:25:52,689
I never regretted having you.

731
01:25:57,819 --> 01:26:00,905
You were the reason I kept going.

732
01:26:05,618 --> 01:26:07,162
Why didn't you tell me?

733
01:26:16,212 --> 01:26:20,133
I didn't want you to carry my burden.

734
01:26:29,684 --> 01:26:31,686
Maybe if you'd never had me,

735
01:26:32,187 --> 01:26:34,147
you would've gone to Rum. Am I right?

736
01:26:48,328 --> 01:26:52,081
1 Corinthians 13:4-7.

737
01:26:52,790 --> 01:26:55,960
"A person who loves perseveres,

738
01:26:56,461 --> 01:26:58,421
always trusts,

739
01:26:58,922 --> 01:27:01,090
always hopes,

740
01:27:01,174 --> 01:27:03,885
bears everything."

741
01:27:13,353 --> 01:27:14,729
I love you.

742
01:27:17,774 --> 01:27:19,859
And I'll wait for you.

743
01:28:15,164 --> 01:28:17,125
Handsome boy.

744
01:28:19,043 --> 01:28:20,586
Otep, meet Joy.

745
01:29:43,252 --> 01:29:44,128
Seph.

746
01:29:45,630 --> 01:29:46,714
Where are you?

747
01:29:59,560 --> 01:30:00,603
By the way…

748
01:30:03,523 --> 01:30:05,483
this is enough to get you home.

749
01:30:08,653 --> 01:30:10,321
What are you gonna do, Marlon?

750
01:30:10,405 --> 01:30:14,158
I don't know. They said
Michelle's pregnancy is complicated.

751
01:30:17,120 --> 01:30:20,873
I'll deal with that asshole
when I get back home.

752
01:30:30,258 --> 01:30:31,592
But what about you?

753
01:30:34,303 --> 01:30:36,180
Michelle needs it more than I do.

754
01:30:39,016 --> 01:30:41,602
Just call me if you need anything, okay?

755
01:30:42,812 --> 01:30:44,021
Be careful out there.

756
01:30:45,440 --> 01:30:46,357
Take care, Marlon.

757
01:30:48,484 --> 01:30:49,610
You too.

758
01:31:09,297 --> 01:31:11,007
How's it going over there?

759
01:31:11,090 --> 01:31:13,634
I'm gonna go see that bastard later.

760
01:31:15,136 --> 01:31:18,139
Get out of this person's body now!

761
01:31:18,931 --> 01:31:19,974
Get out!

762
01:31:20,600 --> 01:31:24,103
Get out!

763
01:31:24,729 --> 01:31:28,649
Out! Get out!

764
01:31:28,733 --> 01:31:32,778
Get out!

765
01:31:34,697 --> 01:31:39,285
Brothers and sisters,
we are now witnessing

766
01:31:39,368 --> 01:31:44,707
the fruits of our faith in the Holy Lord.

767
01:31:47,043 --> 01:31:48,628
I don't think so!

768
01:31:48,711 --> 01:31:50,963
-That shameless woman again.
-Don't make a scene.

769
01:31:51,047 --> 01:31:52,006
Get her out.

770
01:31:52,089 --> 01:31:55,426
Is this what you do here?
Touch women without their consent?

771
01:31:57,595 --> 01:31:58,763
Pastor!

772
01:31:58,846 --> 01:32:02,975
When you say, "Lead by example,"
do you turn them into rapists like you?

773
01:32:03,059 --> 01:32:05,937
I knew it! That pastor is a pervert!

774
01:32:06,020 --> 01:32:07,146
You monster!

775
01:32:07,230 --> 01:32:09,815
If I were you,
I wouldn't let him touch me!

776
01:32:09,899 --> 01:32:11,192
Fuck you!

777
01:32:11,275 --> 01:32:15,738
These are the hands of the Holy Lord.

778
01:32:15,821 --> 01:32:19,075
You're even using God's name
to justify that shit.

779
01:32:19,825 --> 01:32:21,827
Serves him right! He's a rapist!

780
01:32:25,748 --> 01:32:27,833
-That's enough!
-Enough!

781
01:32:32,547 --> 01:32:34,215
You monster!

782
01:32:34,298 --> 01:32:37,843
You're the devil! The devil!

783
01:32:37,927 --> 01:32:39,804
You're the damn devil!

784
01:32:39,887 --> 01:32:42,431
Michelle, that's enough.

785
01:33:41,574 --> 01:33:43,701
But maybe he already told me everything.

786
01:33:45,703 --> 01:33:47,330
In his own way.

787
01:34:08,351 --> 01:34:09,977
'Cause I know

788
01:34:11,604 --> 01:34:13,606
he loved me enough.

789
01:34:17,652 --> 01:34:19,820
He loved me sincerely.

790
01:34:43,427 --> 01:34:44,553
Mi amor…

791
01:37:29,468 --> 01:37:31,595
PASTOR SILVA (MISSION HEAD) CALLING

792
01:38:29,403 --> 01:38:36,243
FOR DAD

793
