ORIGINAL STORY BY KAZUAKI TAKANO

2
00:01:25,418 --> 00:01:29,839
Life goes on to wherever.

3
00:02:00,787 --> 00:02:05,250
The green light is on.
Please cross the street.

4
00:02:36,531 --> 00:02:40,118
You will die in 6 hours.

5
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:51,296
YOU WILL DIE IN 6 HOURS

6
00:04:26,975 --> 00:04:30,895
The train bound for Suseo
is now approaching.

7
00:04:31,312 --> 00:04:35,024
All passengers,
please take a step back.

8
00:04:41,406 --> 00:04:49,414
Please watch your step
as you get on and off the train.

9
00:04:54,335 --> 00:04:56,379
Attention, please.
This train is…

10
00:04:56,379 --> 00:05:00,008
Every day, I send reminder texts
to myself.

11
00:05:01,426 --> 00:05:04,429
Don’t die. Grin and bear it,
LEE Jung-yoon.

12
00:05:27,452 --> 00:05:28,911
One Heets Blue.

13
00:05:43,426 --> 00:05:44,886
Is this a meal?

14
00:05:45,344 --> 00:05:48,514
I saw you eat it and wanted
it too, kid.

15
00:05:49,557 --> 00:05:52,393
If you work that hard,
do they pay you more?

16
00:05:53,352 --> 00:05:55,063
Even if they do, it’s not much.

17
00:05:56,189 --> 00:05:58,649
Still, you work for the government.

18
00:05:59,484 --> 00:06:01,444
Everyone is dying to become one.

19
00:06:01,694 --> 00:06:02,862
A civil servant.

20
00:06:05,031 --> 00:06:09,994
Then why don’t you try
like everyone else?

21
00:06:11,412 --> 00:06:12,497
Please.

22
00:06:13,498 --> 00:06:18,169
I’m struggling to make ends meet.
What civil servant exam?

23
00:06:20,963 --> 00:06:25,676
I don’t wanna sound like
an old-timer, so I’ll go.

24
00:06:28,805 --> 00:06:30,264
Wait, Mister.

25
00:06:31,182 --> 00:06:32,892
What?

26
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:37,271
It’s my birthday today.

27
00:06:39,482 --> 00:06:40,399
So?

28
00:06:40,942 --> 00:06:42,151
Just saying.

29
00:06:46,155 --> 00:06:48,032
Why? Do you need something?

30
00:06:48,741 --> 00:06:51,077
If I do, will you buy it for me?

31
00:06:51,077 --> 00:06:52,370
Well…

32
00:06:53,871 --> 00:06:57,291
Let’s grab some good food
later on tonight.

33
00:06:57,708 --> 00:06:59,043
What good food?

34
00:06:59,710 --> 00:07:01,170
I’ll think about it.

35
00:07:01,671 --> 00:07:02,755
See ya.

36
00:07:08,219 --> 00:07:10,138
HAPPY BIRTHDAY MS. LEE!
LOAN AVAILABLE IN 24 HOURS

37
00:07:11,389 --> 00:07:13,182
I’LL SEE YOU AT 6 PM THAT DAY

38
00:07:13,182 --> 00:07:14,267
Jeez…

39
00:07:18,771 --> 00:07:25,403
YOU DIDN’T FORGET, DID YOU?

40
00:07:40,710 --> 00:07:43,546
CASH PRICE! BLOWOUT SALE!

41
00:08:04,609 --> 00:08:05,860
After today,

42
00:08:06,777 --> 00:08:08,613
my 20s will be over.

43
00:08:10,948 --> 00:08:15,369
I thought I’d be living well
in my 30s.

44
00:08:17,580 --> 00:08:22,752
I wake up to the mold on the ceiling
of my semi-basement unit.

45
00:08:24,378 --> 00:08:30,176
It’s looking more like the mold
on the ceiling of my mom’s house.

46
00:08:34,472 --> 00:08:37,475
I thought if I ran away
from her hellish home,

47
00:08:37,808 --> 00:08:39,852
everything would be fine.

48
00:08:41,687 --> 00:08:43,314
But I was wrong.

49
00:08:44,690 --> 00:08:51,822
I see other people
and dream of living like them.

50
00:08:56,827 --> 00:09:00,915
Life goes on to wherever.

51
00:09:23,354 --> 00:09:27,650
The green light is on.
Please cross the street.

52
00:09:48,129 --> 00:09:50,131
You will die in 6 hours.

53
00:10:08,733 --> 00:10:10,443
What did you say back then?

54
00:10:10,443 --> 00:10:13,321
I said, you will die tonight.

55
00:10:16,532 --> 00:10:20,578
What is this the latest scam?
That’s new.

56
00:10:21,954 --> 00:10:24,081
I have to tell you something.
It’s important.

57
00:10:24,081 --> 00:10:25,791
What are you doing?

58
00:10:25,791 --> 00:10:26,751
Give me 5 minutes.

59
00:10:26,751 --> 00:10:28,044
Excuse me?

60
00:10:28,794 --> 00:10:31,881
What’s wrong with you?
I’m late for a meeting.

61
00:10:31,881 --> 00:10:34,258
Forget it. The meeting is off.

62
00:10:47,938 --> 00:10:48,939
Mi-jung!

63
00:10:48,939 --> 00:10:51,525
- What?
- Did you wait long?

64
00:10:51,734 --> 00:10:54,070
I met a weird guy on the way…

65
00:10:54,070 --> 00:10:56,113
Jung-yoon? Why are you here?

66
00:10:56,364 --> 00:11:00,076
Didn’t you get my text?

67
00:11:00,076 --> 00:11:02,036
What text?

68
00:11:02,161 --> 00:11:03,496
Honey!

69
00:11:03,496 --> 00:11:05,998
Oh, you’re back early.

70
00:11:06,874 --> 00:11:09,251
- Who’s this?
- Meet my friend Jung-yoon.

71
00:11:09,251 --> 00:11:11,545
- Hello.
- Hi.

72
00:11:11,545 --> 00:11:12,880
Nice to meet you.

73
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:16,384
I’d better go.
The movie is starting soon.

74
00:11:16,384 --> 00:11:18,386
I’ll call you later.

75
00:11:18,761 --> 00:11:20,096
- Okay.
- Bye.

76
00:11:20,096 --> 00:11:21,555
Have fun!

77
00:12:05,724 --> 00:12:07,601
Why did you save me?

78
00:12:07,977 --> 00:12:10,146
You said, I’m dying tonight.

79
00:12:12,690 --> 00:12:15,693
If you died back there,
I would’ve felt somewhat relieved.

80
00:12:16,110 --> 00:12:18,070
Because that means I am wrong.

81
00:12:20,364 --> 00:12:23,784
Are you a psychic or something?

82
00:12:24,702 --> 00:12:28,080
My visions have never been wrong.
You saw earlier.

83
00:12:30,791 --> 00:12:34,503
Do you need money or something?

84
00:12:34,753 --> 00:12:37,339
Wanna get paid for saving my life?

85
00:12:41,177 --> 00:12:43,012
Just cut the crap, will you?

86
00:12:43,554 --> 00:12:45,598
I don’t have money
for a jerk like you.

87
00:12:51,061 --> 00:12:52,480
I saw it.

88
00:12:53,731 --> 00:12:55,191
How you die.

89
00:12:56,692 --> 00:12:58,527
I saw your fate.

90
00:13:01,864 --> 00:13:02,865
What?

91
00:13:04,658 --> 00:13:05,826
Fate?

92
00:13:08,370 --> 00:13:10,706
I said you won’t meet
with your friend, didn’t I?

93
00:13:13,501 --> 00:13:14,752
It’s just…

94
00:13:16,128 --> 00:13:19,089
that my friend forgot
we were meeting too.

95
00:13:19,590 --> 00:13:22,593
Still, I was right.

96
00:13:23,135 --> 00:13:27,264
That doesn’t prove your bullshit.

97
00:13:28,933 --> 00:13:30,935
Don’t get in my face again.

98
00:13:31,644 --> 00:13:33,854
If you do, I’ll call the cops.

99
00:13:37,483 --> 00:13:39,527
I can see someone’s future.

100
00:13:50,913 --> 00:13:53,457
In exactly 5 hours and 49 minutes,

101
00:13:56,293 --> 00:13:57,711
you will die.

102
00:14:01,590 --> 00:14:02,675
Why?

103
00:14:06,220 --> 00:14:08,055
Why do I have to die?

104
00:14:13,686 --> 00:14:16,021
Name, KIM Hae-ji. Age 23.

105
00:14:16,272 --> 00:14:21,485
Estimated time of death between 23:00
on July 11th and 02:00 on the 12th.

106
00:14:26,448 --> 00:14:30,536
Cause of death was a stab to the chest
and neck by a sharp weapon.

107
00:14:30,536 --> 00:14:33,163
She died from excessive bleeding.

108
00:14:33,163 --> 00:14:35,958
The weapon was not found
at the scene.

109
00:14:36,083 --> 00:14:38,961
It appears she was killed
somewhere else

110
00:14:38,961 --> 00:14:41,380
and her body was transported
to the scene.

111
00:14:41,589 --> 00:14:43,549
Found any useful leads?

112
00:14:43,549 --> 00:14:45,968
We went through KIM Hae-ji’s phone.

113
00:14:46,969 --> 00:14:48,762
You will die tonight.

114
00:14:49,138 --> 00:14:50,931
Why are you doing this to me?

115
00:14:51,098 --> 00:14:53,851
I’m telling you your fate.

116
00:14:56,186 --> 00:14:58,397
This was recorded
on the day of the murder.

117
00:14:58,731 --> 00:15:01,150
Did KIM Hae-ji have a history
of being stalked?

118
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:03,736
She called in about it,
a month before she was killed.

119
00:15:06,488 --> 00:15:08,616
Here’s the abandoned factory
murder case.

120
00:15:08,616 --> 00:15:10,826
On the day JI Seo-yeon died,

121
00:15:10,826 --> 00:15:13,412
an unidentified man
predicted that she’d be killed.

122
00:15:13,412 --> 00:15:15,289
Her sister later testified.

123
00:15:15,289 --> 00:15:17,499
- Predicted her murder?
- Yes.

124
00:15:18,042 --> 00:15:19,251
You will…

125
00:15:22,171 --> 00:15:24,089
die in 8 hours.

126
00:15:34,892 --> 00:15:37,353
Are you filming a movie?

127
00:15:38,187 --> 00:15:39,730
Or a drama series?

128
00:15:42,107 --> 00:15:43,859
I don’t know why, either.

129
00:15:45,027 --> 00:15:47,571
I just get visions
of someone’s future.

130
00:15:48,614 --> 00:15:50,366
How they die?

131
00:15:51,241 --> 00:15:53,202
It’s not always that.

132
00:15:54,453 --> 00:15:57,164
I just see unusual things.

133
00:15:58,832 --> 00:16:00,125
Like what?

134
00:16:02,836 --> 00:16:04,213
Unconsciously,

135
00:16:04,588 --> 00:16:09,093
people live by separating
what can and cannot happen to them.

136
00:16:09,635 --> 00:16:14,598
But what I see are things
that people don’t think will happen.

137
00:16:15,599 --> 00:16:17,309
So, you mean,

138
00:16:17,309 --> 00:16:20,020
you can see whatever you want
in the future?

139
00:16:20,646 --> 00:16:23,524
Like all the futures
of everyone here?

140
00:16:23,857 --> 00:16:25,859
I don’t see them by choice.

141
00:16:26,402 --> 00:16:30,489
When I see someone,
the scenes just flash past.

142
00:16:34,743 --> 00:16:39,957
So you happened to bump into me
and had a vision of me dying?

143
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:43,001
Yeah, right.

144
00:16:44,420 --> 00:16:45,796
Fine.

145
00:16:47,715 --> 00:16:50,384
So, how do I die?

146
00:16:51,802 --> 00:16:53,178
In a car accident?

147
00:16:53,345 --> 00:16:54,763
A heart attack?

148
00:16:55,055 --> 00:16:57,099
Or do I get bitten by a zombie?

149
00:16:57,099 --> 00:16:58,183
You get murdered.

150
00:16:59,143 --> 00:17:00,811
I get murdered?

151
00:17:04,940 --> 00:17:06,608
How do I get killed?

152
00:17:06,608 --> 00:17:08,110
Stabbed by a knife.

153
00:17:11,071 --> 00:17:12,364
Where do I get stabbed?

154
00:17:12,364 --> 00:17:13,365
Your chest.

155
00:17:13,782 --> 00:17:15,701
Who stabs me?

156
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:17,661
I only saw…

157
00:17:24,793 --> 00:17:27,171
you getting stabbed
and falling down.

158
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:31,467
It is like a drama series.

159
00:17:31,759 --> 00:17:33,886
It ends right at
an important spot.

160
00:17:34,219 --> 00:17:36,513
To be continued next time?

161
00:17:38,557 --> 00:17:39,600
See ya.

162
00:17:42,936 --> 00:17:44,104
By the way,

163
00:17:45,439 --> 00:17:47,357
how do you know
I’ll die 6 hours later?

164
00:17:47,775 --> 00:17:49,693
Your watch showed 12 o’clock.

165
00:17:53,030 --> 00:17:56,033
How do you know it’s today?
It could be tomorrow.

166
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:58,827
You were wearing that.

167
00:18:03,332 --> 00:18:04,541
Really?

168
00:18:05,292 --> 00:18:07,544
Then if I change, I won’t die, right?

169
00:18:09,338 --> 00:18:10,839
What a laugh.

170
00:18:12,424 --> 00:18:14,134
Then I’ll go and change.

171
00:18:16,637 --> 00:18:18,680
Until now, all the visions…

172
00:18:21,308 --> 00:18:23,644
They came true in real life.

173
00:18:32,486 --> 00:18:35,906
Can you prove it?

174
00:18:55,467 --> 00:18:56,677
Come here.

175
00:19:13,777 --> 00:19:15,112
That’s everything.

176
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:24,288
Listen.

177
00:19:24,496 --> 00:19:28,876
We must identify a suspect
before it turns into a serial case.

178
00:19:29,668 --> 00:19:32,546
How about focusing on the man
who claimed to predict?

179
00:19:32,546 --> 00:19:35,591
Both victims have being stalked
in common.

180
00:19:35,883 --> 00:19:39,553
Could the predictor
and stalker be the same man?

181
00:19:39,845 --> 00:19:43,557
After putting pressure
on the victims to keep them,

182
00:19:44,683 --> 00:19:47,436
he most likely killed them
like in a hunt.

183
00:19:47,811 --> 00:19:51,064
Are there any leads on the suspect
other than the audio file?

184
00:19:51,064 --> 00:19:51,940
There are, sir.

185
00:19:52,900 --> 00:19:55,736
Tip line calls were reported
right after both incidents.

186
00:19:56,111 --> 00:19:58,405
Tip line calls? From where?

187
00:19:58,405 --> 00:20:01,033
Both calls were made from pay phones.

188
00:20:01,033 --> 00:20:02,576
Located any CCTV footages?

189
00:20:02,826 --> 00:20:05,579
There were no CCTVs around
the pay phones.

190
00:20:05,996 --> 00:20:08,749
Chief, it looks like
it was all planned.

191
00:20:09,499 --> 00:20:12,169
It’s a typical criminal pattern
of showing off.

192
00:20:20,886 --> 00:20:24,598
In KIM Hae-ji’s case,

193
00:20:24,806 --> 00:20:28,644
I obtained dashcam footages
from a car by the pay phone,

194
00:20:28,644 --> 00:20:31,313
and requested video analysis
on them.

195
00:20:31,647 --> 00:20:34,066
Wow! Yoo Min-kyung! You did good!

196
00:20:34,066 --> 00:20:35,776
You’ve come a long way!

197
00:20:35,776 --> 00:20:37,819
You’re amazing.

198
00:20:37,819 --> 00:20:38,987
Listen up.

199
00:20:38,987 --> 00:20:41,615
Nothing’s definitive yet,
so don’t get too excited.

200
00:20:42,366 --> 00:20:43,283
Detective PARK.

201
00:20:43,283 --> 00:20:46,495
Identify the caller as soon as
the analysis is done.

202
00:20:46,870 --> 00:20:50,749
Detective YOO, review the forensics
on the victims’ PCs and cellphones.

203
00:20:50,749 --> 00:20:52,042
Yes, sir.

204
00:20:52,042 --> 00:20:55,003
Find everything that can
turn to leads, okay?

205
00:20:55,837 --> 00:20:58,674
And you two, investigate around
the junkyard.

206
00:20:58,674 --> 00:20:59,800
Yes, sir.

207
00:21:00,467 --> 00:21:02,177
Get moving.

208
00:21:02,177 --> 00:21:04,805
- Yes, sir.
- Let’s go.

209
00:21:12,354 --> 00:21:14,189
- Good work.
- Thank you.

210
00:21:14,481 --> 00:21:16,650
I’ll share the dashcam results
when they’re ready.

211
00:21:17,067 --> 00:21:18,110
Thank you.

212
00:21:19,778 --> 00:21:20,988
Sir?

213
00:21:22,322 --> 00:21:23,490
What?

214
00:21:25,867 --> 00:21:27,202
Can we catch him?

215
00:21:27,744 --> 00:21:28,453
Of course.

216
00:21:29,037 --> 00:21:30,872
That’s our job.

217
00:21:42,551 --> 00:21:44,219
Last month, on July 11th,

218
00:21:45,679 --> 00:21:47,973
I saw a woman
stuck inside a car trunk.

219
00:22:00,569 --> 00:22:04,156
Did you tell her that she’d die too?

220
00:22:04,698 --> 00:22:05,824
Yes.

221
00:22:07,826 --> 00:22:09,578
But she didn’t believe me.

222
00:22:10,454 --> 00:22:13,373
I stopped at that
‘cuz I didn’t wanna believe it either.

223
00:22:16,835 --> 00:22:18,545
Last year, in August,

224
00:22:21,381 --> 00:22:24,051
I had a vision of a woman’s murder
at an abandoned factory.

225
00:22:32,267 --> 00:22:34,770
I had no way of knowing

226
00:22:36,063 --> 00:22:38,065
where and when exactly.

227
00:22:40,150 --> 00:22:41,693
They both died

228
00:22:44,237 --> 00:22:46,239
exactly the way I had visioned.

229
00:22:50,077 --> 00:22:51,328
That means,

230
00:22:52,788 --> 00:22:54,790
I have to die too?

231
00:22:57,876 --> 00:23:00,462
For your prophecy
to be proven true.

232
00:23:28,990 --> 00:23:30,992
- Hi, Yoon-jung.
- Hi.

233
00:23:31,201 --> 00:23:34,579
You said, you went to
that guy’s house, right?

234
00:23:34,788 --> 00:23:36,790
Who? Your stalker?

235
00:23:37,874 --> 00:23:42,212
Yeah, but I got scared
and ran away at the door.

236
00:23:42,754 --> 00:23:45,048
It still gives me chills.

237
00:23:45,715 --> 00:23:47,008
Why do you ask?

238
00:23:47,008 --> 00:23:50,679
Can you send me his address?

239
00:23:50,679 --> 00:23:52,139
Why?

240
00:23:52,139 --> 00:23:54,391
Are you gonna go to that stalker?

241
00:23:54,391 --> 00:23:56,059
He stopped calling you, didn’t he?

242
00:23:56,059 --> 00:23:58,228
I just need to check something.

243
00:23:58,228 --> 00:24:01,064
Check what?

244
00:24:01,273 --> 00:24:04,234
What’s wrong?

245
00:24:04,234 --> 00:24:06,069
I’ll tell you later.

246
00:24:08,196 --> 00:24:10,574
Okay, fine.

247
00:24:11,283 --> 00:24:14,202
But don’t go alone, okay?

248
00:24:14,202 --> 00:24:15,370
Okay.

249
00:24:15,370 --> 00:24:17,038
I’ll send the address.

250
00:24:50,280 --> 00:24:51,573
Did you call?

251
00:24:51,573 --> 00:24:55,035
I called to ask something,
but it got resolved.

252
00:24:56,620 --> 00:24:57,954
What is it?

253
00:25:00,040 --> 00:25:02,209
It’s nothing.

254
00:25:03,251 --> 00:25:04,419
Okay, then.

255
00:25:04,586 --> 00:25:06,588
Where should we meet later?

256
00:25:06,588 --> 00:25:08,590
Something came up.

257
00:25:09,049 --> 00:25:11,176
- Really?
- I’ll call you later.

258
00:25:11,718 --> 00:25:13,428
Call me when you’re free.

259
00:25:13,637 --> 00:25:14,804
Bye.

260
00:25:20,060 --> 00:25:25,315
DETECTIVE PARK:
CALL ME IF YOU NEED HELP

261
00:25:43,750 --> 00:25:45,543
Why are you telling me this?

262
00:25:47,504 --> 00:25:49,381
What am I supposed to do?

263
00:25:52,425 --> 00:25:54,469
Can I change my future?

264
00:25:55,345 --> 00:25:57,013
Probably not.

265
00:25:59,140 --> 00:26:00,725
But if I were you,

266
00:26:04,187 --> 00:26:06,606
I’d try to find your killer first.

267
00:26:18,285 --> 00:26:21,121
With 5 hours left till I die,

268
00:26:22,497 --> 00:26:24,791
I set out to find my killer.

269
00:27:31,274 --> 00:27:38,448
When we meet,
I’ll kill you, my fated killer.

270
00:27:49,125 --> 00:27:50,752
Aren’t you asking
where we’re going?

271
00:27:50,752 --> 00:27:51,920
Where to?

272
00:27:56,049 --> 00:27:59,469
There’s a guy who chased me around.
I’m going to him.

273
00:28:00,053 --> 00:28:03,640
If someone will kill me tonight,
like you say,

274
00:28:04,140 --> 00:28:05,809
it’s gotta be him.

275
00:28:06,559 --> 00:28:08,019
How do you know him?

276
00:28:27,247 --> 00:28:29,791
After going on a date for 3 hours,
I get paid.

277
00:28:30,458 --> 00:28:33,586
It’s not much different
from a normal date.

278
00:28:34,003 --> 00:28:35,588
We go on walks.

279
00:28:35,588 --> 00:28:37,006
We eat out.

280
00:28:37,340 --> 00:28:39,968
Usually, the man decides
what to do.

281
00:28:39,968 --> 00:28:42,345
Sometimes, I eat
what I don’t like.

282
00:28:43,138 --> 00:28:45,140
Sometimes we watch plays.

283
00:28:45,473 --> 00:28:47,475
After 3 hours, it’s over.

284
00:28:48,768 --> 00:28:51,146
Sometimes they buy me
clothes or shoes.

285
00:28:52,021 --> 00:28:54,774
Then I just take ‘em.

286
00:29:15,086 --> 00:29:16,296
Well, then…

287
00:30:04,177 --> 00:30:06,179
I got $400 for the 3 hours.

288
00:30:08,223 --> 00:30:10,892
Some girls went to the men’s homes.

289
00:30:11,351 --> 00:30:13,144
Then they got paid more.

290
00:30:13,853 --> 00:30:15,063
What about you?

291
00:30:15,063 --> 00:30:16,731
I just went on dates.

292
00:30:17,190 --> 00:30:22,654
He never said much on our dates
or asked me to do something.

293
00:30:23,238 --> 00:30:26,783
It was weird,
but he only asked for me

294
00:30:27,992 --> 00:30:31,579
when he didn’t seem to have fun
on our dates.

295
00:30:33,289 --> 00:30:34,290
Sir!

296
00:30:35,875 --> 00:30:36,876
Hi.

297
00:30:37,502 --> 00:30:40,880
Remember the Maze Club case
with sex trafficking of minors?

298
00:30:41,589 --> 00:30:44,717
The case closed with CHOI Young-do,
the owner’s arrest.

299
00:30:44,717 --> 00:30:47,387
Still, he only got 3 years
of probation.

300
00:30:47,971 --> 00:30:50,098
You headed the case
with Detective NAM, right?

301
00:30:51,015 --> 00:30:52,016
Yes.

302
00:30:52,559 --> 00:30:55,979
But what does that have to do
with this case?

303
00:30:56,354 --> 00:30:58,731
I found out
while checking their phones

304
00:30:58,731 --> 00:31:02,193
that both victims
worked as Maze Club members.

305
00:31:02,819 --> 00:31:03,945
Are you sure?

306
00:31:03,945 --> 00:31:05,280
Yes, sir.

307
00:31:05,947 --> 00:31:10,410
Also, the Sangdo-dong suicide case
may be connected too.

308
00:31:12,412 --> 00:31:16,332
She was also a Maze Club member
and had a history of being stalked.

309
00:31:36,686 --> 00:31:38,521
Detective PARK can head this.

310
00:31:40,982 --> 00:31:41,983
Sir?

311
00:31:43,234 --> 00:31:45,069
Hand it over to him.

312
00:31:45,612 --> 00:31:46,404
Chief.

313
00:31:47,572 --> 00:31:49,115
I can do this.

314
00:31:50,450 --> 00:31:52,452
I’m not saying that you can’t.

315
00:31:52,452 --> 00:31:55,455
It was his case
before you were assigned here.

316
00:31:55,455 --> 00:31:57,957
So he should take the case.

317
00:31:58,541 --> 00:32:01,294
But he can transfer it to me,
and I can do it.

318
00:32:01,628 --> 00:32:03,546
No buts about it.

319
00:32:04,922 --> 00:32:06,341
Go and work.

320
00:32:06,758 --> 00:32:07,884
Sir…

321
00:32:24,067 --> 00:32:25,151
Ki-hoon.

322
00:32:28,237 --> 00:32:30,156
Things are getting out of control.

323
00:32:31,574 --> 00:32:32,492
Bro.

324
00:32:32,867 --> 00:32:35,161
I’ll take care of it. Don’t worry.

325
00:33:08,569 --> 00:33:11,114
MAZE CLUB

326
00:33:16,661 --> 00:33:20,957
The stalking started from a month
after the club closed down.

327
00:33:22,166 --> 00:33:26,421
My mail and parcels disappeared
and I got prank calls every night.

328
00:33:26,796 --> 00:33:28,172
Did you report it?

329
00:33:28,172 --> 00:33:31,926
Of course. I said it was that guy
I met through the club.

330
00:33:32,051 --> 00:33:33,052
And?

331
00:33:34,887 --> 00:33:38,099
They said there’s no evidence
he’s the culprit.

332
00:33:39,225 --> 00:33:42,729
It may not be him.
It could be another customer you met.

333
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:48,776
The club didn’t give out
our personal information.

334
00:33:48,943 --> 00:33:51,237
They were very strict about that.

335
00:33:51,946 --> 00:33:56,701
We couldn’t meet personally.
Then they’ll lose money.

336
00:33:58,286 --> 00:34:02,498
But he met me several times,
so he must’ve tailed me.

337
00:34:03,666 --> 00:34:06,502
After our dates, he must’ve
followed me home.

338
00:34:11,799 --> 00:34:14,677
I think the chief is deliberately
excluding me from this case.

339
00:34:19,348 --> 00:34:21,309
If it’s a serial case,

340
00:34:21,309 --> 00:34:25,229
it gets complicated.
He’s just being cautious.

341
00:34:25,646 --> 00:34:27,065
I know,

342
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:30,610
but I had to transfer
all my leads to you.

343
00:34:30,610 --> 00:34:31,861
Is it…

344
00:34:34,655 --> 00:34:36,532
Is it because I’m a woman?

345
00:34:37,200 --> 00:34:38,367
Well…

346
00:34:39,744 --> 00:34:40,870
Maybe.

347
00:34:41,162 --> 00:34:42,163
What?

348
00:34:45,500 --> 00:34:47,001
Listen to me.

349
00:34:48,252 --> 00:34:50,963
You’re getting too emotionally
invested in this case.

350
00:34:54,175 --> 00:35:00,223
Seeing the victims, it’s natural
to feel anger as a woman too.

351
00:35:00,223 --> 00:35:00,932
But that’s…

352
00:35:00,932 --> 00:35:02,016
Look.

353
00:35:04,060 --> 00:35:09,482
Empathizing with the victims
never helps with rational judgment.

354
00:35:10,024 --> 00:35:11,651
Sometimes,

355
00:35:12,193 --> 00:35:16,781
emotions can distort the truth.

356
00:35:24,789 --> 00:35:26,415
Damn.

357
00:35:26,707 --> 00:35:28,543
Did I sound too preachy?

358
00:35:31,003 --> 00:35:32,213
No, sir.

359
00:35:32,839 --> 00:35:34,674
I’ll cool my head, then go back in.

360
00:35:35,341 --> 00:35:36,342
Sure.

361
00:35:39,053 --> 00:35:40,221
Don’t smoke too much.

362
00:35:48,187 --> 00:35:49,480
A year ago,

363
00:35:50,481 --> 00:35:55,236
the club got caught for hiring
minors and was shut down.

364
00:35:56,153 --> 00:35:59,740
I was questioned
and investigated too.

365
00:36:01,659 --> 00:36:02,994
Be honest.

366
00:36:04,120 --> 00:36:05,371
You knew
they were minors, right?

367
00:36:05,371 --> 00:36:06,539
No.

368
00:36:07,290 --> 00:36:11,085
I just got the locations to work
through the app.

369
00:36:11,335 --> 00:36:13,963
I don’t know
who else is in the club.

370
00:36:15,214 --> 00:36:18,926
They all use fake names
in their own battles.

371
00:36:19,844 --> 00:36:21,470
How would I know?

372
00:36:26,183 --> 00:36:28,269
What is this card?

373
00:36:30,146 --> 00:36:34,901
When customers log in with the QR codes
on the back, we get matched up.

374
00:36:35,526 --> 00:36:36,903
When did you start this?

375
00:36:37,653 --> 00:36:41,365
I’m not a minor.
Must I tell you that?

376
00:36:41,365 --> 00:36:43,659
You worked elsewhere like this,
didn’t you?

377
00:36:43,659 --> 00:36:46,412
No, it was my first time.

378
00:36:46,662 --> 00:36:50,207
You did it since you were a minor,
didn’t you?

379
00:36:50,207 --> 00:36:51,584
No, I didn’t.

380
00:36:52,501 --> 00:36:54,837
Why would you do
something like this

381
00:36:54,837 --> 00:36:56,589
when you seem normal?

382
00:36:57,965 --> 00:37:02,637
What makes someone normal?

383
00:37:02,803 --> 00:37:06,140
You can make money honestly
and legitimately like everyone else.

384
00:37:06,474 --> 00:37:08,768
Why don’t you try to live
a normal life?

385
00:37:17,401 --> 00:37:18,569
Why?

386
00:37:21,447 --> 00:37:25,993
Do you know how many jobs
I have per day?

387
00:37:28,621 --> 00:37:32,416
I work like crazy,
but I can’t save any money.

388
00:37:33,084 --> 00:37:35,670
I’m scared to buy even a cheap meal.

389
00:37:38,172 --> 00:37:41,008
It’s suffocating just to survive.

390
00:37:41,008 --> 00:37:42,718
How can I…

391
00:37:44,387 --> 00:37:46,263
live a normal life?

392
00:37:53,062 --> 00:37:53,521
Look.

393
00:37:53,521 --> 00:37:54,772
Please!

394
00:37:56,607 --> 00:37:57,984
Don’t pity me.

395
00:38:01,278 --> 00:38:02,822
What do you think

396
00:38:05,366 --> 00:38:06,909
about what I did?

397
00:38:08,244 --> 00:38:11,080
If you can make someone happy
for 3 hours,

398
00:38:12,832 --> 00:38:14,750
maybe it’s meaningful too.

399
00:38:18,713 --> 00:38:23,300
Maybe it’s just self-delusion.

400
00:39:29,116 --> 00:39:30,201
What is it?

401
00:39:31,702 --> 00:39:33,162
It’s all garbage.

402
00:39:33,162 --> 00:39:34,497
There’s so much!

403
00:39:34,497 --> 00:39:37,958
Excuse me. Do you live here?

404
00:39:39,543 --> 00:39:40,586
No.

405
00:39:41,712 --> 00:39:44,465
Do you know the man
who lives here?

406
00:39:45,591 --> 00:39:46,884
He left.

407
00:39:47,968 --> 00:39:49,011
What?

408
00:39:50,054 --> 00:39:51,597
Where did he go?

409
00:39:51,889 --> 00:39:53,891
He moved out today.

410
00:39:54,934 --> 00:39:56,352
Damn it.

411
00:40:01,524 --> 00:40:04,819
Then… who are you, sir?

412
00:40:05,319 --> 00:40:06,695
The homeowner.

413
00:40:08,280 --> 00:40:10,116
The floor is scratched up.

414
00:40:10,616 --> 00:40:12,368
What is this shit?

415
00:40:12,368 --> 00:40:13,869
Wait.

416
00:40:14,745 --> 00:40:17,790
Do you know where he went?

417
00:40:22,920 --> 00:40:24,797
He said he’s going back home.

418
00:40:25,297 --> 00:40:26,257
Home?

419
00:40:27,550 --> 00:40:29,885
He said he’s taking the ship
at 9:30 p.m.

420
00:40:31,804 --> 00:40:33,722
I didn’t know he was so messy!

421
00:40:33,722 --> 00:40:35,808
He’s taking a ship?
Where is his hometown?

422
00:40:36,267 --> 00:40:37,476
Yanbian!

423
00:40:39,061 --> 00:40:41,063
If you know him, just call him.

424
00:40:41,730 --> 00:40:44,984
Why did I take him in?
Damn it!

425
00:40:48,320 --> 00:40:49,572
Shit.

426
00:40:53,701 --> 00:40:54,702
Hi.

427
00:40:54,952 --> 00:40:57,580
There’s a new guy with her, sir.

428
00:40:57,955 --> 00:40:59,456
What are you talking about?

429
00:40:59,748 --> 00:41:00,791
LEE Jung-yoon.

430
00:41:00,791 --> 00:41:02,877
She’s going around with some guy.

431
00:41:03,836 --> 00:41:04,879
A guy?

432
00:41:06,130 --> 00:41:07,173
Where are you?

433
00:41:08,007 --> 00:41:09,466
In Chinatown.

434
00:41:09,466 --> 00:41:10,968
Chinatown…

435
00:41:11,927 --> 00:41:14,597
If you can, take a picture of him
and send it.

436
00:41:15,472 --> 00:41:16,515
Yes, sir.

437
00:41:16,515 --> 00:41:18,767
Don’t come back here
and keep tailing them.

438
00:41:18,767 --> 00:41:21,228
Report to me if anything happens
to LEE Jung-yoon.

439
00:41:21,228 --> 00:41:22,229
Okay.

440
00:41:29,862 --> 00:41:33,449
CERTIFICATE OF ENTRY & DEPARTURE

441
00:41:53,344 --> 00:41:55,262
DETECTIVE NAM:
SHE’S ON A BUS

442
00:42:04,271 --> 00:42:07,441
Do you really think
our fates are determined?

443
00:42:08,234 --> 00:42:12,321
I don’t just think that.
I have no choice but to believe it.

444
00:42:17,243 --> 00:42:20,871
I have 3 hours and 12 minutes left

445
00:42:21,538 --> 00:42:23,540
if what you say is my fate.

446
00:42:26,710 --> 00:42:29,088
Got anyone you’d like to see?
Like family?

447
00:42:31,340 --> 00:42:32,967
There’s no one.

448
00:42:36,720 --> 00:42:39,265
So, is anything identifiable?

449
00:42:39,515 --> 00:42:43,894
It’s hard because the dashcam
is far from the pay phone,

450
00:42:44,436 --> 00:42:46,605
but I’ll do what I can for this.

451
00:42:46,605 --> 00:42:47,982
Want another cup?

452
00:42:48,232 --> 00:42:50,317
How about a beer instead of coffee?

453
00:42:52,569 --> 00:42:54,238
I’m busy, pal. Hurry up.

454
00:43:12,339 --> 00:43:13,632
What’s wrong?

455
00:43:17,636 --> 00:43:18,971
I see something.

456
00:43:25,019 --> 00:43:26,854
Are you okay?

457
00:43:31,734 --> 00:43:33,068
A granny…

458
00:43:35,487 --> 00:43:36,488
What?

459
00:43:41,243 --> 00:43:43,078
I’ve never seen her before.

460
00:43:50,127 --> 00:43:51,754
She resembles you.

461
00:43:53,589 --> 00:43:57,009
She’s surrounded by family.
They look sad.

462
00:44:03,140 --> 00:44:06,852
By chance, am I there too?

463
00:44:09,813 --> 00:44:10,856
No.

464
00:44:14,151 --> 00:44:15,235
Whoa.

465
00:44:18,864 --> 00:44:19,865
Why?

466
00:44:22,826 --> 00:44:24,661
My grandma is in the hospital

467
00:44:26,246 --> 00:44:28,248
from a car accident
2 weeks ago.

468
00:44:51,605 --> 00:44:54,692
Please leave a message after the…

469
00:44:56,819 --> 00:44:57,903
Damn.

470
00:45:48,495 --> 00:45:51,665
Funny meeting you here.
Have you been well?

471
00:45:53,625 --> 00:45:54,543
Yes.

472
00:45:59,715 --> 00:46:02,259
I’m moving back home.

473
00:46:03,010 --> 00:46:06,054
There’s no future for me here.

474
00:46:06,930 --> 00:46:08,974
It’s nice to see you one last time.

475
00:46:10,851 --> 00:46:11,852
Wait.

476
00:46:27,242 --> 00:46:28,327
Here.

477
00:46:31,288 --> 00:46:33,999
You gave this to me
when we first met.

478
00:46:36,585 --> 00:46:38,378
I don’t need it anymore.

479
00:46:53,060 --> 00:46:54,144
Bye.

480
00:46:57,523 --> 00:46:58,232
Wait.

481
00:47:01,902 --> 00:47:04,029
Can I ask you something?

482
00:47:06,156 --> 00:47:07,157
Sure.

483
00:47:08,075 --> 00:47:11,161
Why’d you always ask for me?

484
00:47:13,121 --> 00:47:17,292
You didn’t seem that happy
on our dates.

485
00:47:18,669 --> 00:47:19,795
Alice…

486
00:47:24,132 --> 00:47:25,884
I thought you knew too.

487
00:47:26,802 --> 00:47:29,638
That no matter what,
we’re not getting anywhere…

488
00:47:32,266 --> 00:47:33,517
and alone.

489
00:47:44,319 --> 00:47:48,073
My name is LIM Jong-hyuk.

490
00:47:50,158 --> 00:47:52,244
If you can, remember me.

491
00:47:56,081 --> 00:47:57,416
I’m…

492
00:48:02,921 --> 00:48:04,506
I’m LEE Jung-yoon.

493
00:48:06,592 --> 00:48:08,051
LEE Jung-yoon.

494
00:48:09,636 --> 00:48:11,096
LEE Jung-yoon…

495
00:48:33,535 --> 00:48:34,786
How does it feel?

496
00:48:37,331 --> 00:48:39,291
Seeing someone’s future?

497
00:48:40,334 --> 00:48:41,501
It’s painful.

498
00:48:42,127 --> 00:48:44,212
Because there’s nothing I can do.

499
00:48:45,422 --> 00:48:48,300
Though you’re about to die,
I can only watch.

500
00:48:50,510 --> 00:48:58,060
I guess it’s painful whether you know
or don’t know your fate.

501
00:49:09,529 --> 00:49:11,365
My grandma is fine.

502
00:49:14,201 --> 00:49:15,494
That’s good.

503
00:49:20,874 --> 00:49:22,376
They said,

504
00:49:23,210 --> 00:49:26,963
Grandma’s bones healed
and she’s eating well too!

505
00:49:29,800 --> 00:49:31,009
Why you…

506
00:49:33,595 --> 00:49:35,597
Are you sure I’m going to die?

507
00:50:09,923 --> 00:50:12,134
I got a call from the hospital
2 weeks ago.

508
00:50:14,469 --> 00:50:17,764
They said to send money
for Grandma’s surgery.

509
00:50:19,683 --> 00:50:23,228
Mom left my number on file
because she has no money.

510
00:50:26,982 --> 00:50:29,693
It was the first time I heard about
my family in 10 years.

511
00:50:34,990 --> 00:50:37,200
I’m glad your grandma is fine.

512
00:50:42,789 --> 00:50:43,790
Thanks.

513
00:50:48,962 --> 00:50:50,630
What do you want to do

514
00:50:51,298 --> 00:50:53,300
if you make it past tonight?

515
00:51:01,183 --> 00:51:05,353
I just want to live in a small place

516
00:51:07,856 --> 00:51:11,443
and be happy with people I love.

517
00:51:13,236 --> 00:51:14,738
You’re a visionary.

518
00:51:16,072 --> 00:51:17,115
What?

519
00:51:18,158 --> 00:51:19,576
A dreamer.

520
00:51:23,955 --> 00:51:26,041
Then you’re a visionary too.

521
00:51:26,708 --> 00:51:28,376
You have visions.

522
00:51:34,049 --> 00:51:35,717
They’re just nightmares.

523
00:51:44,309 --> 00:51:48,814
There are 2 and a half hours left.

524
00:52:05,455 --> 00:52:06,581
It’s done.

525
00:52:09,709 --> 00:52:13,672
What? This is KIM Jun-woo.

526
00:52:13,672 --> 00:52:14,881
KIM Jun-woo?

527
00:52:14,881 --> 00:52:19,094
He’s the boyfriend of
the abandoned factory victim.

528
00:52:32,274 --> 00:52:33,859
Where are you going now?

529
00:52:34,442 --> 00:52:37,696
I’m not sure
where I should go, either.

530
00:52:39,614 --> 00:52:40,907
Do you know?

531
00:52:43,159 --> 00:52:46,037
All I know is that you’re going to die
at midnight.

532
00:52:54,212 --> 00:52:58,008
What in the world
am I doing here with you?

533
00:52:59,801 --> 00:53:02,596
You’re looking for the one
who’s going to kill you.

534
00:53:08,894 --> 00:53:12,981
What if everything you’re saying
is a lie?

535
00:53:15,066 --> 00:53:17,152
Why would I lie to you?

536
00:53:20,322 --> 00:53:23,742
How would I know
what you’re thinking?

537
00:53:32,250 --> 00:53:35,837
Never mind.
I’m the one who followed you.

538
00:53:44,054 --> 00:53:45,597
This is…

539
00:54:11,498 --> 00:54:12,916
Think KIM Jun-woo is the killer?

540
00:54:14,250 --> 00:54:15,460
Probably.

541
00:54:16,044 --> 00:54:17,545
Why would he kill her?

542
00:54:21,549 --> 00:54:22,676
For punishment.

543
00:54:22,884 --> 00:54:24,052
Punishment?

544
00:54:24,052 --> 00:54:26,596
He probably couldn’t stand

545
00:54:27,013 --> 00:54:29,641
for staining his perfect life.

546
00:54:30,517 --> 00:54:33,103
To KIM Jun-woo,
JI Seo-yeon must’ve been

547
00:54:33,979 --> 00:54:36,398
like a watch or shoes he owned.

548
00:54:37,440 --> 00:54:39,693
Belongings can be discarded,
is that it?

549
00:54:40,193 --> 00:54:41,319
He’s got some nerves.

550
00:54:41,319 --> 00:54:44,197
He killed his girlfriend,
and faked an alibi.

551
00:54:44,656 --> 00:54:46,825
What about KIM Hae-ji
and the suicide victim?

552
00:54:47,200 --> 00:54:49,619
Think about the connection
to the Maze Club.

553
00:54:49,995 --> 00:54:54,541
Maybe he thinks it’s his calling
to clean up the corrupt society.

554
00:54:56,543 --> 00:55:00,797
Sir, will you report it to the chief?

555
00:55:01,506 --> 00:55:03,425
Of course.

556
00:55:04,050 --> 00:55:07,804
So we can set KIM Jun-woo as a suspect
and keep investigating.

557
00:55:49,054 --> 00:55:51,723
SARA

558
00:56:12,869 --> 00:56:14,537
Did you know about it?

559
00:56:16,039 --> 00:56:17,832
Yes, I headed the case.

560
00:56:19,292 --> 00:56:21,086
Why’d you cover it up?

561
00:56:24,214 --> 00:56:25,840
It involves our station.

562
00:56:28,968 --> 00:56:32,013
Please don’t preach about
camaraderie and such.

563
00:56:33,473 --> 00:56:34,849
Camaraderie?

564
00:56:36,142 --> 00:56:38,353
Do you think I have that in me?

565
00:56:39,771 --> 00:56:41,106
Then why?

566
00:56:45,360 --> 00:56:47,779
What will happen if the chief
gets arrested?

567
00:56:48,488 --> 00:56:51,241
The serial murder investigation
will lose course

568
00:56:52,367 --> 00:56:54,744
and the focus will be on
police corruption.

569
00:56:58,123 --> 00:57:02,544
So, you planned to keep it buried,
until you catch the killer?

570
00:57:02,961 --> 00:57:04,838
First things first.

571
00:57:07,006 --> 00:57:08,216
Still,

572
00:57:09,217 --> 00:57:12,762
as we keep investigating,
the chief’s ties to the Maze club

573
00:57:14,347 --> 00:57:16,015
is bound to surface.

574
00:57:19,185 --> 00:57:20,979
Probably.

575
00:57:24,524 --> 00:57:26,276
But now is not the time.

576
00:57:26,818 --> 00:57:30,905
Catching KIM Jun-woo is top priority.

577
00:57:37,662 --> 00:57:39,038
KIM Jun-woo…

578
00:57:39,497 --> 00:57:41,040
I’ll make the report.

579
00:57:51,593 --> 00:57:52,677
Chief.

580
00:57:53,303 --> 00:57:55,180
I got the video analysis results.

581
00:57:55,346 --> 00:57:57,015
Let’s see.

582
00:57:57,015 --> 00:58:00,351
KIM Jun-woo, age 27.
He was JI Seo-yeon’s boyfriend.

583
00:58:01,060 --> 00:58:02,061
Who?

584
00:58:02,520 --> 00:58:04,814
The first victim
at the abandoned factory.

585
00:58:06,065 --> 00:58:07,192
Sara?

586
00:58:09,027 --> 00:58:12,864
Now, he’s a suspect.

587
00:58:21,456 --> 00:58:22,582
Ki-hoon.

588
00:58:23,833 --> 00:58:26,419
This will be linked to
the Maze Club, won’t it?

589
00:58:28,129 --> 00:58:30,089
I was about to tell you.

590
00:58:31,382 --> 00:58:33,343
Detective YOO found out everything.

591
00:58:36,095 --> 00:58:38,514
You’ve come too far
to go unscathed.

592
00:58:38,806 --> 00:58:41,976
Let’s end it with as few scars
as possible.

593
00:58:44,312 --> 00:58:45,271
How?

594
00:58:45,772 --> 00:58:47,649
I’ll use KIM Jun-woo.

595
00:58:47,899 --> 00:58:51,402
We’ve located him.
Detective NAM is on his tail.

596
00:58:52,028 --> 00:58:55,490
First, call Detective NAM back here.

597
00:58:58,743 --> 00:58:59,911
Okay.

598
00:59:01,371 --> 00:59:02,538
And, bro?

599
00:59:03,790 --> 00:59:06,501
Trust me. Okay?

600
00:59:10,296 --> 00:59:11,381
Okay.

601
00:59:21,599 --> 00:59:23,101
What is this place?

602
00:59:23,726 --> 00:59:27,146
I came to buy
self-defense goods here once.

603
00:59:28,481 --> 00:59:32,277
If I have to die,
I want it to be less painful.

604
01:00:08,688 --> 01:00:09,689
May I?

605
01:00:09,689 --> 01:00:10,773
Come in.

606
01:00:33,588 --> 01:00:35,965
Can this block a knife?

607
01:00:36,883 --> 01:00:38,176
Of course not.

608
01:00:38,968 --> 01:00:40,762
It can block bullets, but not knives.

609
01:00:40,762 --> 01:00:43,931
Then what can block a knife?

610
01:00:46,726 --> 01:00:48,019
Hold on a sec.

611
01:01:01,115 --> 01:01:03,534
I’ll take this call outside.

612
01:01:18,508 --> 01:01:19,801
Hi, Jung-yoon.

613
01:01:20,009 --> 01:01:22,720
Let me ask you a question.

614
01:01:23,054 --> 01:01:25,807
If someone’s with you,
just say yes or no.

615
01:01:26,057 --> 01:01:28,142
No, I’m alone.

616
01:01:28,142 --> 01:01:34,732
Is there someone around you now
who says he sees the future?

617
01:01:34,899 --> 01:01:36,359
How do you know that?

618
01:01:38,444 --> 01:01:39,862
That man…

619
01:01:41,864 --> 01:01:44,075
He’s a suspect
in a serial murder case.

620
01:01:50,957 --> 01:01:52,375
Are you okay?

621
01:01:56,337 --> 01:01:57,338
Yes.

622
01:01:57,547 --> 01:01:58,589
Jung-yoon.

623
01:01:59,090 --> 01:02:01,551
Can you do me a favor?

624
01:02:05,054 --> 01:02:06,764
I know where that is.

625
01:02:08,349 --> 01:02:09,642
I’ll go there.

626
01:02:10,435 --> 01:02:11,936
But, Mister…

627
01:02:12,603 --> 01:02:17,066
Is that man really a…

628
01:02:19,902 --> 01:02:24,449
No matter what he told you,
he’s an unrehabilitable bastard.

629
01:02:25,241 --> 01:02:27,118
I have to catch him.

630
01:02:29,036 --> 01:02:33,541
I promise to protect you
no matter what.

631
01:02:34,417 --> 01:02:35,793
You trust me, right?

632
01:02:37,086 --> 01:02:38,087
Yes.

633
01:02:38,546 --> 01:02:41,007
Good. Thanks.

634
01:02:58,858 --> 01:03:02,361
FAITH IS BEING SURE OF WHAT WE HOPE FOR
AND CERTAIN OF WHAT WE DO NOT SEE

635
01:03:24,217 --> 01:03:26,677
LEE JUNG-YOON: I’M ON MY WAY

636
01:03:44,570 --> 01:03:47,657
We’re here.
This is where I’ll die.

637
01:04:41,794 --> 01:04:45,590
The current time is 11:35 p.m.

638
01:04:52,263 --> 01:04:53,806
25 minutes left.

639
01:05:18,122 --> 01:05:20,082
CHIEF HWANG

640
01:05:29,592 --> 01:05:30,676
Yes, Chief.

641
01:05:30,843 --> 01:05:32,053
Where are you?

642
01:05:32,678 --> 01:05:35,765
Ah… well…

643
01:05:35,765 --> 01:05:37,767
Detective PARK gave the orders?

644
01:05:37,767 --> 01:05:41,395
Pardon? Ah…

645
01:05:41,395 --> 01:05:43,147
Who are you tailing now?

646
01:05:45,941 --> 01:05:48,903
LEE Jung-yoon.
She used to work for Maze Club.

647
01:05:48,903 --> 01:05:52,073
Detective PARK told me to watch her
from a stalker.

648
01:05:52,823 --> 01:05:56,202
Is she with a man now?

649
01:05:56,661 --> 01:05:57,662
Yes.

650
01:05:58,871 --> 01:06:00,790
Send me your location.

651
01:06:00,790 --> 01:06:03,084
And listen to me carefully.

652
01:06:03,459 --> 01:06:05,961
Detective PARK is on his way there.

653
01:06:05,961 --> 01:06:07,713
Then should I join him?

654
01:06:07,713 --> 01:06:11,759
No, stay and watch the situation
and report to me directly.

655
01:06:11,884 --> 01:06:14,428
Tell PARK that you returned
to the station.

656
01:06:14,428 --> 01:06:15,429
Pardon?

657
01:06:16,472 --> 01:06:17,139
NAM Sang-hyun.

658
01:06:17,848 --> 01:06:21,644
Don’t try to use your head
and just do what you’re told.

659
01:06:23,938 --> 01:06:25,314
Yes, sir.

660
01:06:32,488 --> 01:06:34,198
Did you hear from Ki-hoon?

661
01:06:35,324 --> 01:06:37,368
I found out and asked him.

662
01:06:40,121 --> 01:06:41,288
Good.

663
01:06:41,872 --> 01:06:42,957
So?

664
01:06:45,751 --> 01:06:50,965
I wanted to hear it from you,
before I report it to internal affairs.

665
01:06:53,008 --> 01:06:54,844
Want me to apologize?

666
01:06:55,177 --> 01:06:56,846
Why’d you do it, sir?

667
01:07:04,520 --> 01:07:05,855
Chief!

668
01:07:07,314 --> 01:07:09,275
It’s just as you know it.

669
01:07:10,151 --> 01:07:11,360
Nothing more

670
01:07:12,153 --> 01:07:13,487
and nothing less.

671
01:07:24,582 --> 01:07:28,210
First, let’s deal with KIM Jun-woo.

672
01:07:28,627 --> 01:07:31,505
Detective NAM
located KIM Jun-woo.

673
01:07:31,922 --> 01:07:34,008
Detective PARK is on his way there.

674
01:07:35,134 --> 01:07:36,177
What?

675
01:07:37,636 --> 01:07:39,388
They’ve located KIM Jun-woo?

676
01:07:41,432 --> 01:07:43,517
Ki-hoon didn’t tell you?

677
01:07:44,101 --> 01:07:46,687
He told Detective NAM to tail him.

678
01:07:52,943 --> 01:07:55,696
DETECTIVE NAM: I’M HEADING BACK

679
01:08:18,677 --> 01:08:20,679
No one believed me.

680
01:08:23,349 --> 01:08:25,100
Because it sounds crazy

681
01:08:26,685 --> 01:08:28,813
that I had a vision of them dying.

682
01:08:30,356 --> 01:08:32,024
What are you trying to say?

683
01:08:43,994 --> 01:08:45,579
You don’t believe me, either.

684
01:08:51,085 --> 01:08:52,753
Who was on the phone?

685
01:08:59,844 --> 01:09:01,595
Can you trust that person?

686
01:09:03,389 --> 01:09:04,390
No.

687
01:09:06,642 --> 01:09:09,645
I don’t trust anyone,
but myself now,

688
01:09:10,145 --> 01:09:11,981
because I’m the one who dies.

689
01:09:12,481 --> 01:09:14,400
I’m the one who saw that.

690
01:09:15,651 --> 01:09:17,653
You have to trust me.

691
01:09:26,412 --> 01:09:30,249
The current time is 11:57 p.m.

692
01:09:30,875 --> 01:09:32,501
It’s almost time

693
01:09:34,336 --> 01:09:35,671
for you to die.

694
01:09:49,435 --> 01:09:50,811
Don’t touch me!

695
01:09:50,811 --> 01:09:52,438
Let me go!

696
01:09:55,399 --> 01:09:56,609
Please…

697
01:10:00,112 --> 01:10:01,488
Please trust me.

698
01:10:20,257 --> 01:10:21,342
Freeze!

699
01:10:21,675 --> 01:10:25,638
Let go of her
and turn to me, slowly.

700
01:10:40,694 --> 01:10:42,112
Put the knife down.

701
01:10:44,031 --> 01:10:45,824
Drop it, KIM Jun-woo!

702
01:10:46,533 --> 01:10:47,785
Stay back.

703
01:10:48,452 --> 01:10:50,246
I’m warning you
according to protocol.

704
01:10:50,663 --> 01:10:54,541
If you don’t drop the knife,
I will have to shoot.

705
01:10:55,584 --> 01:10:56,961
Drop the knife.

706
01:10:57,586 --> 01:10:59,046
I can’t drop it.

707
01:11:00,089 --> 01:11:02,174
The killer will come now.

708
01:11:02,466 --> 01:11:03,634
Killer?

709
01:11:04,677 --> 01:11:07,846
Why? Are you worried?

710
01:11:09,223 --> 01:11:11,308
That she won’t die like you said?

711
01:11:12,476 --> 01:11:13,519
No.

712
01:11:14,103 --> 01:11:15,938
That you can’t kill her?

713
01:11:17,022 --> 01:11:20,567
You didn’t predict,
but gave notice of killing her.

714
01:11:21,110 --> 01:11:23,362
She’s the one who got you here.

715
01:11:23,529 --> 01:11:25,572
She helped lure you in.

716
01:11:36,583 --> 01:11:38,919
It’s over, you crazy murderer!

717
01:11:47,094 --> 01:11:48,137
It was you.

718
01:11:54,226 --> 01:11:55,686
You killed her!

719
01:12:02,985 --> 01:12:06,739
The current time is 11:59 p.m.

720
01:12:15,456 --> 01:12:16,707
Are you okay?

721
01:12:19,335 --> 01:12:20,335
Yes.

722
01:12:22,296 --> 01:12:22,963
Sorry.

723
01:12:22,963 --> 01:12:24,965
I should’ve come sooner.

724
01:12:28,010 --> 01:12:31,305
It’s okay. You came on time.

725
01:12:31,555 --> 01:12:32,556
Right.

726
01:12:40,647 --> 01:12:44,276
It’s 12:00 a.m., midnight.

727
01:12:44,485 --> 01:12:49,073
DON’T DIE. GRIN AND BEAR IT,
LEE JUNG-YOON.

728
01:12:52,451 --> 01:12:55,579
How do you know
I’ll die 6 hours later?

729
01:12:56,955 --> 01:12:59,917
Your watch showed 12 o’clock.

730
01:13:30,364 --> 01:13:32,616
Happy birthday, LEE Jung-yoon.

731
01:13:36,203 --> 01:13:40,499
I prepared a surprise gift for you.

732
01:13:41,333 --> 01:13:42,668
So you should

733
01:13:43,335 --> 01:13:45,546
say thank you and take it.

734
01:13:47,714 --> 01:13:49,174
Go on.

735
01:13:50,717 --> 01:13:51,969
Here.

736
01:14:01,103 --> 01:14:06,775
Are you the one who killed
those women?

737
01:14:10,779 --> 01:14:12,114
Why?

738
01:14:16,577 --> 01:14:17,911
Rehabilitation.

739
01:14:21,665 --> 01:14:23,250
Rehabilitation?

740
01:14:24,710 --> 01:14:26,503
What is my calling?

741
01:14:29,381 --> 01:14:31,717
It’s protecting the safety
of the public,

742
01:14:32,426 --> 01:14:37,806
bringing criminals to justice,
and rehabilitating them.

743
01:14:40,100 --> 01:14:42,895
Those women were innocent.

744
01:14:43,729 --> 01:14:46,773
Fuck! How can you say
they were innocent?

745
01:14:51,945 --> 01:14:53,780
I’ll ask you one more time.

746
01:14:55,574 --> 01:15:01,997
Was the Maze Club good or evil?

747
01:15:02,456 --> 01:15:04,041
What are you saying?

748
01:15:05,375 --> 01:15:06,376
Evil.

749
01:15:06,960 --> 01:15:08,003
Evil!

750
01:15:09,838 --> 01:15:11,340
Absolute evil.

751
01:15:11,798 --> 01:15:14,009
The evil meeting place
that corrodes the world,

752
01:15:14,343 --> 01:15:17,137
bitches like you,
who worked under CHOI,

753
01:15:17,888 --> 01:15:19,890
and the police that knew

754
01:15:21,808 --> 01:15:26,563
who covered it up for money,
are all fucking beyond redemption!

755
01:15:30,651 --> 01:15:32,444
What right do you have?

756
01:15:33,278 --> 01:15:35,322
Who are you to judge?

757
01:15:38,533 --> 01:15:39,660
Jung-yoon.

758
01:15:42,454 --> 01:15:43,747
What do you think?

759
01:15:45,707 --> 01:15:47,042
Do you think

760
01:15:48,752 --> 01:15:50,837
you have the right to be saved?

761
01:15:56,635 --> 01:15:57,803
Saved?

762
01:16:02,182 --> 01:16:04,268
Just as I can’t save you,

763
01:16:04,977 --> 01:16:06,186
you, too,

764
01:16:07,020 --> 01:16:08,855
can’t save me.

765
01:16:10,565 --> 01:16:11,817
Fuck.

766
01:16:13,568 --> 01:16:15,570
Don’t you get the point here?

767
01:16:20,576 --> 01:16:22,327
The only thing that can save us

768
01:16:25,414 --> 01:16:28,917
is ourselves, you pitiful loser.

769
01:16:48,603 --> 01:16:51,398
Now, you’re out, too.

770
01:16:53,608 --> 01:16:54,651
Then,

771
01:16:58,989 --> 01:17:02,326
watch and remember your ending.

772
01:17:03,744 --> 01:17:05,746
This is how you die.

773
01:17:06,705 --> 01:17:07,748
Now…

774
01:17:19,051 --> 01:17:22,220
The current time is 12:01 a.m.

775
01:18:10,727 --> 01:18:11,770
Why!

776
01:18:14,731 --> 01:18:16,274
Why did you kill her!

777
01:18:22,823 --> 01:18:24,157
Stop!

778
01:18:27,953 --> 01:18:29,246
Stop it.

779
01:18:30,997 --> 01:18:33,583
Do you want to be like
that son of a bitch?

780
01:18:37,963 --> 01:18:39,923
Let’s stop here.

781
01:18:45,053 --> 01:18:47,514
Right, bastard. Stop…

782
01:19:13,957 --> 01:19:15,750
Freeze, KIM Jun-woo!

783
01:20:01,588 --> 01:20:05,050
Are you the one who killed
those women?

784
01:20:07,260 --> 01:20:08,428
Why?

785
01:20:09,262 --> 01:20:10,514
Rehabilitation.

786
01:20:11,806 --> 01:20:13,225
Rehabilitation?

787
01:20:14,851 --> 01:20:17,395
What is my calling?

788
01:20:19,523 --> 01:20:21,858
It’s protecting the safety
of the public,

789
01:20:22,567 --> 01:20:25,278
bringing criminals to justice,

790
01:20:26,613 --> 01:20:28,615
and rehabilitating them.

791
01:20:30,200 --> 01:20:33,078
Those women were innocent.

792
01:20:37,249 --> 01:20:41,545
Can you send me that file?

793
01:20:45,090 --> 01:20:46,091
Yes.

794
01:20:59,104 --> 01:21:01,523
How did you survive?

795
01:21:06,194 --> 01:21:08,488
I can’t see my own future,
so I got this.

796
01:21:13,910 --> 01:21:15,787
I guess yours didn’t work.

797
01:21:22,419 --> 01:21:26,673
If it went in any deeper,
I would’ve died.

798
01:21:30,635 --> 01:21:31,803
Still,

799
01:21:33,221 --> 01:21:36,308
your vision was right.

800
01:21:50,697 --> 01:21:52,907
My girlfriend died a year ago.

801
01:21:57,162 --> 01:22:00,582
I had a vision of her dying,
but I couldn’t save her.

802
01:22:02,667 --> 01:22:04,753
I couldn’t see the time or date.

803
01:22:07,547 --> 01:22:09,549
I saw the dress I bought for her

804
01:22:13,303 --> 01:22:14,804
stained in blood.

805
01:22:18,558 --> 01:22:21,645
At my girlfriend’s funeral,
I had a vision of someone dying.

806
01:22:24,606 --> 01:22:26,358
It was a friend of hers.

807
01:22:29,903 --> 01:22:32,530
Not long after,
that person ended up dead too.

808
01:22:34,157 --> 01:22:36,785
I told her what I saw,
but she didn’t believe me.

809
01:22:38,953 --> 01:22:41,039
Three women died like that.

810
01:22:43,583 --> 01:22:47,128
I found out later that they worked
at the same club as my girlfriend.

811
01:22:48,546 --> 01:22:51,132
So I started looking for
other people who worked there.

812
01:22:53,134 --> 01:22:55,220
You know fate can’t be changed.

813
01:22:56,012 --> 01:22:57,055
Why?

814
01:22:58,139 --> 01:23:00,141
You’ll just suffer more.

815
01:23:02,352 --> 01:23:04,354
It suddenly dawned on me.

816
01:23:06,898 --> 01:23:10,235
What if I follow my visions
and find the killer?

817
01:23:11,277 --> 01:23:15,115
Though I can’t stop someone’s death,
maybe I can stop the killer?

818
01:23:17,534 --> 01:23:20,453
That’s when you found me?

819
01:23:21,121 --> 01:23:23,164
As soon as I saw you,
I had the vision.

820
01:23:24,207 --> 01:23:26,668
But this time,
I could see the date and time.

821
01:23:28,628 --> 01:23:32,674
I thought maybe I can be there
at that moment.

822
01:23:34,968 --> 01:23:38,596
That’s why you followed me
till the end?

823
01:23:40,932 --> 01:23:43,018
Though I can’t change your fate…

824
01:23:43,810 --> 01:23:49,065
You had to be there to try
and catch the killer.

825
01:23:52,569 --> 01:23:53,737
You did it.

826
01:23:55,655 --> 01:23:56,573
What?

827
01:23:57,157 --> 01:24:01,411
You changed the fates
of many more people.

828
01:24:09,419 --> 01:24:10,545
You think so?

829
01:24:11,421 --> 01:24:12,756
I believe it.

830
01:24:13,965 --> 01:24:17,635
I’m living proof of it.

831
01:25:01,012 --> 01:25:04,057
Life goes on to wherever.

832
01:25:22,408 --> 01:25:26,746
The green light is on.
Please cross the street.

833
01:25:43,388 --> 01:25:45,849
I thought we’d meet someday.

834
01:25:46,474 --> 01:25:48,476
We met sooner than I thought.

835
01:25:49,644 --> 01:25:50,979
How’ve you been?

836
01:25:51,813 --> 01:25:52,981
How do I look?

837
01:25:53,731 --> 01:25:54,774
Good.

838
01:25:59,195 --> 01:26:04,075
What about you?
Still have the nightmares?

839
01:26:05,743 --> 01:26:08,454
No, not anymore.

840
01:26:09,664 --> 01:26:11,207
That’s too bad.

841
01:26:11,708 --> 01:26:16,546
If I met you, I wanted to ask
how I die.

842
01:26:18,506 --> 01:26:20,758
The granny in my last vision

843
01:26:23,052 --> 01:26:27,557
was surrounded by her family
in a warm household.

844
01:26:28,558 --> 01:26:31,603
She was lying on a bed
and catching her breath.

845
01:26:32,228 --> 01:26:36,733
An elderly man, who is her husband,
was holding her hand tightly.

846
01:26:37,609 --> 01:26:38,818
It wasn’t me.

847
01:26:42,196 --> 01:26:44,198
That’s how the vision ended.

848
01:26:46,451 --> 01:26:51,289
So you’ll live a happy life
till the end.

849
01:26:52,373 --> 01:26:54,167
You’re not lying, are you?

850
01:26:57,295 --> 01:26:59,130
You still don’t trust me?

851
01:27:00,340 --> 01:27:02,342
Because it wasn’t
at midnight, then?

852
01:27:04,093 --> 01:27:06,471
There’s something
I forgot to tell you.

853
01:27:08,056 --> 01:27:12,352
My watch was 1 minute slower
back then.

854
01:27:13,603 --> 01:27:16,898
So your vision was exactly right.

855
01:27:18,399 --> 01:27:21,027
I’ll believe you.

856
01:27:24,072 --> 01:27:25,907
60 years later,

857
01:27:28,034 --> 01:27:29,661
you will die.

858
01:27:58,356 --> 01:28:01,442
YOU WILL DIE IN 6 HOURS

859
01:28:02,235 --> 01:28:05,863
