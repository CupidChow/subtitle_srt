If you're going to throw him away, 
don't give birth.

5
00:02:34,653 --> 00:02:36,023
Take care of that girl.

6
00:04:05,403 --> 00:04:06,353
Is there anything?

7
00:04:09,873 --> 00:04:11,103
She must have run away.

8
00:04:13,273 --> 00:04:14,313
I guess she was.

9
00:04:15,623 --> 00:04:16,903
Give me the towel.

10
00:04:26,153 --> 00:04:27,873
Woosung-ah, I'm sorry.

11
00:04:28,213 --> 00:04:29,853
I'll definitely come to pick you up.

12
00:04:31,103 --> 00:04:33,333
Here we go again, 
"I'll definitely come to pick you up"

13
00:04:33,463 --> 00:04:34,793
No contact information...

14
00:04:37,613 --> 00:04:39,633
I don't think so.

15
00:04:40,683 --> 00:04:42,843
Hey, delete the video quickly.

16
00:04:51,433 --> 00:04:54,313
Your eyes are so bright, huh?

17
00:04:54,723 --> 00:04:57,523
It's because these eyebrows aren't thick enough.

18
00:04:57,533 --> 00:04:59,523
Even so, you're such a cute kid.

19
00:05:00,153 --> 00:05:03,803
How can you think of 
throwing it away? Really, huh?

20
00:05:05,513 --> 00:05:07,113
So you are Woosung.

21
00:05:07,883 --> 00:05:09,323
Yes, Woo Sung-ah.

22
00:05:10,163 --> 00:05:13,663
You want to be happy with us now, huh?

23
00:05:14,403 --> 00:05:15,433
Huh?

24
00:07:35,863 --> 00:07:38,433
<i>Those who use a bus or express bus</i>

25
00:07:38,433 --> 00:07:40,423
<i>Please get off.</i>

29
00:08:53,263 --> 00:08:54,803
- How's your knee?
- Yes?

{\an8}[Okay Laundry]

31
00:08:54,803 --> 00:08:57,143
- You hurt your knee.
- Yes, it's okay.

32
00:08:57,143 --> 00:08:59,053
- Are you okay?
- Oh, it's gotten a lot better.

33
00:08:59,233 --> 00:09:00,443
Okay.

34
00:09:00,473 --> 00:09:03,233
Come out often. You have to come
and go out like this before you can exercise.

35
00:09:03,283 --> 00:09:05,953
<i>It's been a while and I just
want to rest whenever I come here.</i>

36
00:09:06,733 --> 00:09:08,623
Is the laundry doing well these days?

37
00:09:09,683 --> 00:09:11,683
Well, it's just that, what...

38
00:09:27,463 --> 00:09:30,883
Socrates' brother.

39
00:09:59,013 --> 00:10:00,163
By the way,

40
00:10:01,543 --> 00:10:03,993
I can't believe they're thinking about using baby boxes for human trafficking.

41
00:10:04,003 --> 00:10:05,753
That's really daring.

42
00:10:07,813 --> 00:10:10,623
Because they made a box like
 that in the first place

43
00:10:11,313 --> 00:10:13,503
There are irresponsible mothers...

44
00:10:14,453 --> 00:10:17,263
Team Leader, you have a very nice side.

45
00:10:18,623 --> 00:10:19,633
Why?

46
00:10:19,773 --> 00:10:21,053
Oh, that baby.

47
00:10:21,053 --> 00:10:23,943
Would he have died if he
had left him on the floor?

48
00:10:26,843 --> 00:10:28,233
I'm kind.

49
00:10:29,013 --> 00:10:30,153
You didn't you know, right?

50
00:10:31,223 --> 00:10:33,493
Was the kid a boy or a girl?

51
00:10:40,583 --> 00:10:41,883
- Hello.
- How are you?

52
00:10:41,973 --> 00:10:43,123
You worked hard.

53
00:10:43,303 --> 00:10:45,543
Last time it was really delicious, that...

54
00:10:46,843 --> 00:10:49,103
The name is Shu, Shu...

55
00:10:49,213 --> 00:10:51,673
- Schweinshaxe.
- Ah, Schweinshaxe.

56
00:10:52,003 --> 00:10:53,593
The next day, my skin

57
00:10:53,593 --> 00:10:55,633
I was really surprised
because it was so smooth.

58
00:10:55,633 --> 00:10:57,633
What are you saying? It's just <i>jokbal</i>.

59
00:10:57,913 --> 00:11:00,053
And, uh, do you happen to know Choucroute?

60
00:11:00,353 --> 00:11:02,393
That's what I'm
going to try this time.

61
00:11:02,393 --> 00:11:04,473
I think you can come and eat
with me when I do that.

62
00:11:04,473 --> 00:11:06,513
It's just a boiled pork. It's bland.

63
00:11:07,053 --> 00:11:09,353
I left the white one at the dry cleaner'

64
00:11:09,353 --> 00:11:10,693
I brought it in black instead.

65
00:11:10,693 --> 00:11:12,313
- It's thick.
- Oh, thanks.

66
00:11:12,313 --> 00:11:14,403
- Just in case you didn't know...
- Oh, thanks.

67
00:11:14,403 --> 00:11:16,023
- Go, yeah, go
- Yeah.

68
00:11:18,063 --> 00:11:19,743
- Take care.
- Yes, yes.

69
00:11:23,943 --> 00:11:25,273
Really, no matter what

70
00:11:25,273 --> 00:11:27,703
He come down, say
hello and see off...

71
00:11:27,703 --> 00:11:28,953
It's okay.

72
00:11:28,953 --> 00:11:30,733
I'm just staying home all day anyway, so what?

73
00:11:30,733 --> 00:11:32,333
It's good to work out.

74
00:11:33,233 --> 00:11:35,753
He's such a person that is perfect for marriage.

75
00:11:35,873 --> 00:11:36,843
Oh, really?

76
00:11:37,403 --> 00:11:39,313
What about it? Do you want it?

77
00:11:39,613 --> 00:11:41,563
No, because even if you have a baby,

78
00:11:41,563 --> 00:11:43,873
Since you write at home,
you can take care of the kids...

79
00:11:46,203 --> 00:11:47,633
Did the baby's mother come to visit?

80
00:11:52,743 --> 00:11:53,813
What's wrong?

81
00:11:54,763 --> 00:11:55,843
Yes.

82
00:11:56,453 --> 00:11:58,903
She said she left it outside the box.

83
00:12:02,973 --> 00:12:05,243
Are you not mistaken?
Are you out of your mind?

84
00:12:10,913 --> 00:12:14,663
Hey, if you think you're going to
the police, bring them over here, got it?

85
00:12:15,593 --> 00:12:16,713
I will do that.

86
00:12:18,643 --> 00:12:19,463
Got it.

87
00:12:26,273 --> 00:12:28,273
There's nothing
written in the records though...

88
00:12:31,303 --> 00:12:32,603
Call the pastor.

89
00:12:32,603 --> 00:12:35,273
And can I ask you a favor 
to take Soo-kyung a bath?

90
00:12:35,273 --> 00:12:36,523
Yes, I understand.

91
00:12:41,093 --> 00:12:42,943
You were on duty yesterday, right?

92
00:12:43,963 --> 00:12:46,203
Yes, I always...

93
00:12:46,973 --> 00:12:50,083
Can you show her some
of the babies you have now?

94
00:12:55,593 --> 00:12:57,333
This is a playroom for big kids.

95
00:12:57,763 --> 00:13:00,093
There are now nineteen
children living there.

96
00:13:00,973 --> 00:13:03,033
They're all dumped in the baby box.

97
00:13:09,553 --> 00:13:11,433
He came in last week and...

98
00:13:11,653 --> 00:13:13,523
Her mom was 15 years old and...

99
00:13:15,433 --> 00:13:17,023
His mom is from Pakistan.

100
00:13:18,333 --> 00:13:20,403
What, are you a babysitter?

101
00:13:21,653 --> 00:13:22,903
That's it?

102
00:13:25,503 --> 00:13:26,703
That's right, for now.

103
00:13:29,483 --> 00:13:32,773
What about letters?
Did you put it in together?

104
00:13:35,203 --> 00:13:36,123
Yes.

105
00:13:37,133 --> 00:13:40,193
What about your name and contact information?
Did you write that too?

106
00:13:43,903 --> 00:13:45,843
So even if you have a baby,

107
00:13:46,213 --> 00:13:48,093
There is no evidence
that you're the mother...

108
00:13:49,213 --> 00:13:50,393
What's going on?

109
00:13:51,713 --> 00:13:54,523
She said she's looking
for a baby, it's Woosung.

110
00:13:55,793 --> 00:13:58,943
I heard you left your baby
outside the baby box yesterday.

111
00:14:00,443 --> 00:14:03,783
If you put it in the box, our
staff will go out immediately.

112
00:14:03,783 --> 00:14:05,513
I would have talked to the baby's mother.

113
00:14:05,513 --> 00:14:06,513
Right.

114
00:14:06,843 --> 00:14:09,113
- That's what I said.
- Peek-a-boo!

115
00:14:09,383 --> 00:14:11,243
Peek-a-boo!

116
00:14:50,413 --> 00:14:51,493
Of course not.

117
00:14:53,643 --> 00:14:54,783
Kidnapping?

118
00:14:55,943 --> 00:14:57,503
I mean, what are you talking about...

119
00:14:58,063 --> 00:14:59,123
Hey, isn't it?

120
00:15:00,643 --> 00:15:02,383
You threw him away.
What are you talking about?

121
00:15:02,383 --> 00:15:04,293
I didn't throw it away, didn't I leave it to you?

122
00:15:04,853 --> 00:15:06,923
Do you think we're like a dog hotel?

123
00:15:07,883 --> 00:15:10,883
I wrote in the letter saying
I'd come to pick him up.

124
00:15:16,503 --> 00:15:18,833
If there's a message that 
you're coming to pick him up,

125
00:15:18,833 --> 00:15:21,523
The church takes him off the adoption lists.

126
00:15:22,183 --> 00:15:24,163
He's 100% going to a daycare.

127
00:15:24,893 --> 00:15:26,273
Do you know what that means?

128
00:15:27,083 --> 00:15:30,033
Well, I guess you
did it out of love though

129
00:15:30,103 --> 00:15:33,813
That's what narrows down
this child's future possibilities.

130
00:15:34,903 --> 00:15:36,123
We are...

131
00:15:36,733 --> 00:15:37,833
Yes, Woosung...

132
00:15:38,373 --> 00:15:42,793
I want to save Woosung
from such a dark future.

133
00:15:44,083 --> 00:15:46,603
Rather than growing up as an
 orphan in a daycare facility

134
00:15:46,683 --> 00:15:49,303
I prefer to grow him up
in a warm home...

135
00:15:50,993 --> 00:15:52,303
It's much better.

136
00:15:55,703 --> 00:15:56,643
Adoption.

137
00:15:57,813 --> 00:15:59,433
We're looking for parents to raise them.

138
00:16:00,183 --> 00:16:02,443
You don't have
the right to do that.

139
00:16:02,443 --> 00:16:04,693
You don't have either,
because you threw him away.

140
00:16:04,693 --> 00:16:06,863
- You stole them.
- For protection.

141
00:16:06,863 --> 00:16:10,233
Eh, of course we don't
have that right, we don't.

142
00:16:10,243 --> 00:16:12,953
In a nutshell...

143
00:16:13,003 --> 00:16:15,673
Should I say it's a good will? Yeah.

144
00:16:17,073 --> 00:16:18,423
Good will...

145
00:16:19,333 --> 00:16:21,973
It's been a while since I heard that word.

146
00:16:22,043 --> 00:16:24,753
Even if they want to have children, 
they can't have them

147
00:16:24,753 --> 00:16:26,293
And in the arms of those parents

148
00:16:26,293 --> 00:16:28,953
who can't wait for the adoption screening period,

149
00:16:29,293 --> 00:16:33,933
The person who had to separate
him for this unspeakable circumstance...

150
00:16:34,723 --> 00:16:36,453
Your name is...

151
00:16:37,943 --> 00:16:40,183
It's Seon-ah, Moon Seon-ah.

152
00:16:40,373 --> 00:16:41,603
Ms. Seon-ah.

153
00:16:41,603 --> 00:16:45,113
It's a Cupid holding
Seon-ah's precious baby.

154
00:16:45,113 --> 00:16:46,653
You can think of it that way.

155
00:16:47,343 --> 00:16:51,193
Yes, I promise to find the best
 adoptive parents for Woosung.

156
00:16:53,313 --> 00:16:55,003
Cupid my ass...

157
00:16:55,553 --> 00:16:57,873
Yeah, well,
It's a bit weird to call him...

158
00:16:58,193 --> 00:16:59,503
What's good...

159
00:16:59,543 --> 00:17:02,753
Should I call him the uncle of Samshin*?
Since it's two of you, the three Gods?

160
00:16:59,563 --> 00:17:02,743
{\an8}*T/N The three Gods who occupy the infant and take care of the mother and child

161
00:17:03,653 --> 00:17:05,123
Oh, there...

162
00:17:05,123 --> 00:17:09,253
It's a case by case,
but there's a small kickback.

163
00:17:10,473 --> 00:17:11,853
Reward?

164
00:17:12,843 --> 00:17:14,223
How much was it?

165
00:17:14,983 --> 00:17:18,263
In the case of a boy,
it's about 10 million won.

166
00:17:18,793 --> 00:17:20,013
To whom?

167
00:17:20,413 --> 00:17:24,933
Of course, with Seon-ah
and us who are mediators...

168
00:17:30,083 --> 00:17:31,943
You like good will.

169
00:17:32,893 --> 00:17:35,073
But you're just a broker.

170
00:17:37,873 --> 00:17:40,223
To put it simply, yes.

171
00:17:47,213 --> 00:17:49,213
When is the departure?

172
00:17:55,153 --> 00:17:57,343
- Have a rest.
- Yes, take care.

173
00:17:57,343 --> 00:17:58,593
I will.

174
00:18:03,603 --> 00:18:06,103
She's the mother of that baby, right?

175
00:18:07,693 --> 00:18:09,273
Who knows.

176
00:18:11,863 --> 00:18:14,043
It doesn't look like that...

177
00:18:25,253 --> 00:18:26,523
Oh, Taeho.

178
00:18:26,943 --> 00:18:28,493
What are you doing h...

179
00:18:29,903 --> 00:18:31,453
Oh, hello.

180
00:18:32,343 --> 00:18:34,423
We're closed temporarily today though...

181
00:18:34,743 --> 00:18:37,973
I don't know if this will go away...

182
00:18:39,333 --> 00:18:42,013
This, this...

183
00:18:43,223 --> 00:18:44,183
This is...

184
00:18:44,183 --> 00:18:46,223
Hey, you can clearly see it's a blood.

185
00:18:48,123 --> 00:18:49,523
Well, I'll try then...

186
00:18:50,033 --> 00:18:51,523
And, the...

187
00:18:51,973 --> 00:18:53,933
The money that is due next week...

188
00:18:53,943 --> 00:18:56,323
We're going to open a 
chicken restaurant here.

189
00:18:59,613 --> 00:19:01,493
Well, if you really can't
Well, go to the casino...

190
00:19:01,493 --> 00:19:03,823
No. I'm not going back.

191
00:19:04,853 --> 00:19:06,833
I guess there's another way.

192
00:19:07,553 --> 00:19:09,463
Then 5,000 won until next week.
(about $4)

193
00:19:09,463 --> 00:19:11,423
And please take
care of that shirt.

194
00:19:11,423 --> 00:19:12,713
Yes.

195
00:19:14,903 --> 00:19:16,053
Goodbye.

196
00:19:18,033 --> 00:19:19,423
Hey, Taeho.

197
00:19:20,513 --> 00:19:23,473
Since when did you hang
out with thugs like that?

198
00:19:24,073 --> 00:19:25,553
What are you nagging about?

199
00:19:25,903 --> 00:19:28,893
Mister, mind your own business.

200
00:19:29,383 --> 00:19:32,773
You and your mom were doing well.

201
00:19:33,723 --> 00:19:36,233
I feel like throwing up 
whenever I see wheat noodles.

202
00:19:56,163 --> 00:19:57,633
What's up with them?

203
00:19:58,243 --> 00:20:01,303
It's nothing.
They came to complain.

204
00:20:02,913 --> 00:20:04,683
Also fix this, please.

205
00:20:05,043 --> 00:20:09,063
This is how you do it. 
Press it to the left.

206
00:20:20,723 --> 00:20:22,283
Do I have to take her?

207
00:20:23,153 --> 00:20:26,493
Well, it's good to get less suspicious
when the kid's mom is by his side.

208
00:20:28,023 --> 00:20:30,243
Ms. Seon-ah, let's go, let's go.

209
00:20:30,633 --> 00:20:32,693
She's not crazy about money.

210
00:20:33,843 --> 00:20:36,223
- Five to five?
- Of course.

211
00:20:36,263 --> 00:20:38,253
At least cut it into three pieces...

212
00:20:40,703 --> 00:20:44,203
Two and a half hours by
Gyeongbu Expressway to Yeongdeok.

213
00:20:44,223 --> 00:20:48,163
I took a break at the rest stop
 in Gyeongju around lunch time...

214
00:21:17,523 --> 00:21:22,223
With that kind of car,
You won't go too far, will you?

215
00:21:23,023 --> 00:21:26,243
Maybe to Ulsan or Pohang?

216
00:21:31,573 --> 00:21:34,853
I really want to hurry up and
 wash up and change clothes.

217
00:21:36,883 --> 00:21:38,063
You know that, right?

218
00:21:38,483 --> 00:21:42,693
I'm gonna make sure 
he's caught red-handed.

219
00:21:51,163 --> 00:21:55,163
Ms. Seon-ah, where is your hometown?

220
00:21:59,293 --> 00:22:00,673
I'm from Busan.

221
00:22:02,153 --> 00:22:06,553
He self-proclaimed he's from Seoul.

222
00:22:06,553 --> 00:22:07,703
Self-proclaimed?

223
00:22:10,073 --> 00:22:11,403
Where are you from though?

224
00:22:12,083 --> 00:22:13,313
Yeosu.

225
00:22:13,523 --> 00:22:15,313
Ah...Yeosu?

226
00:22:16,233 --> 00:22:18,543
There's nothing but a gondola, isn't it?

227
00:22:18,793 --> 00:22:20,233
Cable car.

228
00:22:20,463 --> 00:22:22,153
The <i>seodaehoe</i> there is delicious.

229
00:22:22,553 --> 00:22:24,403
Fresh kimchi is also delicious...
Oh, what's that?

230
00:22:35,493 --> 00:22:37,843
Back then, you know when
 we went to sell the kid?

231
00:22:39,113 --> 00:22:41,203
Why did we used to pretend a male couple?

232
00:22:41,673 --> 00:22:43,593
Oh yeah, right, right, right.

233
00:22:43,593 --> 00:22:46,963
That was in Yeosu.
Oh, yeah, yeah.

234
00:22:47,373 --> 00:22:50,723
How am I going to live? I must be an 
elementary school student already.

235
00:22:50,993 --> 00:22:54,563
The Yeosu night sea ♪

236
00:22:58,983 --> 00:23:02,313
Don't talk nonsense,
leave the negotiation to us

237
00:23:02,313 --> 00:23:06,653
Right, the customer comes first.

238
00:23:07,303 --> 00:23:09,613
- So think of them as people who buy...
- Hyung, hyung

239
00:23:09,613 --> 00:23:10,493
- What?
- He's coming.

240
00:23:12,063 --> 00:23:14,703
Uh, Mr. Lim Chang-ho?

241
00:23:15,593 --> 00:23:17,083
Yes, yes, I'm from Busan...

242
00:23:17,083 --> 00:23:18,913
- Yes, show me the baby.
- Yes, yes.

243
00:23:18,923 --> 00:23:20,653
He slept and just woke up...

244
00:23:22,443 --> 00:23:23,733
He's pretty, right?

245
00:23:26,973 --> 00:23:29,973
Hey, did you do photoshop?

246
00:23:30,133 --> 00:23:32,263
This one is a little 
less cute than the picture...

247
00:23:32,263 --> 00:23:33,933
Yes, it's because he slept 
and just woke up, that's why.

248
00:23:34,153 --> 00:23:36,473
No, but you can see
the eyebrows here.

249
00:23:36,473 --> 00:23:37,933
It's too thin...

250
00:23:37,933 --> 00:23:41,193
Because it's a baby, I mean, he
usually looks like this, like this.

251
00:23:41,193 --> 00:23:43,353
He's so pretty. Hey,Woosung-ah, 
open your eyes.

252
00:23:43,363 --> 00:23:44,473
Open your eyes, huh?

253
00:23:44,473 --> 00:23:45,613
Let's do 400.

254
00:23:46,193 --> 00:23:49,003
No, didn't you say
thousand yesterday?

255
00:23:49,003 --> 00:23:50,953
No, four hundred is a lot for this.

256
00:23:50,953 --> 00:23:52,153
Isn't it?

257
00:23:52,543 --> 00:23:54,413
Or, I'll do it in installments.
Can I pay in installments, right?

258
00:23:54,633 --> 00:23:56,373
- In 12 months.
- Yes.

259
00:23:57,183 --> 00:23:58,703
No, I've never done this before.

260
00:23:58,703 --> 00:24:01,583
No, it would be difficult if you
suddenly put up such a condition.

261
00:24:01,583 --> 00:24:03,793
What kind of person is his father?

262
00:24:05,263 --> 00:24:06,153
His father?

263
00:24:07,183 --> 00:24:08,323
His father, well...

264
00:24:08,443 --> 00:24:09,803
Ah, don't tell me...

265
00:24:10,163 --> 00:24:12,133
I-It's not like rape, is it?

266
00:24:12,133 --> 00:24:13,833
- So it's probably that way.
- What are you talking about?

267
00:24:13,833 --> 00:24:14,983
- If you get involved...
- No.

268
00:24:14,993 --> 00:24:18,063
No, the baby's mother is here, 
but she's such a faithful person.

269
00:24:18,063 --> 00:24:21,353
Right now, I'm on my own,
taking care of my ill parents...

270
00:24:21,353 --> 00:24:23,143
Hey, you crazy bastard.

271
00:24:24,333 --> 00:24:25,863
What, what, crazy bastard?

272
00:24:26,573 --> 00:24:30,283
I don't even think about his face,
like no eyebrows or small eyes

273
00:24:30,283 --> 00:24:32,403
What are you saying now? Crazy bitch.

274
00:24:32,403 --> 00:24:35,103
- This woman is crazy, really....
- What, you bastard!

275
00:24:35,103 --> 00:24:37,033
Ms. Seon-ah, Ms. Seon-ah, yes

276
00:24:38,483 --> 00:24:41,833
No, hey, what is this
person doing? Rudely...

277
00:24:42,113 --> 00:24:43,293
Rude?

278
00:24:43,483 --> 00:24:47,923
Yeah, I'm fucking rude.
Are you polite? Huh?

279
00:24:47,923 --> 00:24:51,713
You look at other people's faces and 
talk nonsense. Are you being so polite?

280
00:24:52,513 --> 00:24:56,023
Oh, I came all the way to this crappy 
village on purpose. What, 400?

281
00:24:56,293 --> 00:24:59,043
I'm not playing around,
this is fuckin' real.

282
00:24:59,823 --> 00:25:02,553
I can never give it to people like you.

283
00:25:02,943 --> 00:25:05,693
Get off before I do 
anything worse, you beggar bastard.

284
00:25:05,963 --> 00:25:08,693
What, what a beggar, really...

285
00:25:09,853 --> 00:25:11,213
No...

286
00:25:18,893 --> 00:25:22,173
No, what a beggar...

287
00:25:22,223 --> 00:25:23,083
Really...

288
00:25:41,863 --> 00:25:45,013
would you like to eat crab?
Everything is steamed in the store.

289
00:25:48,603 --> 00:25:49,823
That was too much.

290
00:25:50,613 --> 00:25:52,403
Yeah, yeah, it was too much.

291
00:25:52,483 --> 00:25:54,063
That's what I mean.

292
00:25:55,553 --> 00:25:57,453
The other party is the customer.

293
00:25:57,863 --> 00:25:59,323
We're haggling, each other...

294
00:25:59,323 --> 00:26:01,413
Then you are a customer.

295
00:26:01,413 --> 00:26:03,993
If it wasn't for the customer, I'd be terrified.

296
00:26:06,443 --> 00:26:09,383
And then we find a point of agreement.

297
00:26:10,683 --> 00:26:14,173
So, with that attitude...
No matter what...

298
00:26:14,173 --> 00:26:17,343
Bring a better buyer if
you wanna make it work!

299
00:26:19,803 --> 00:26:21,163
That makes sense.

300
00:26:21,163 --> 00:26:24,453
What is 4 million won in 12 months
installments? Are you kidding me, really?

301
00:26:28,733 --> 00:26:29,913
What should we do?

302
00:26:31,373 --> 00:26:33,073
Are you going back to Busan?

303
00:26:34,433 --> 00:26:37,363
Yeah, what's the point?

304
00:26:39,583 --> 00:26:41,193
Are there any other candidates?

305
00:26:45,693 --> 00:26:47,333
- You're here?
- Yes

306
00:26:47,983 --> 00:26:49,873
Is there blood?

307
00:26:50,073 --> 00:26:51,893
- A little.
- Want some candy?

308
00:26:51,903 --> 00:26:52,963
Oh my, thank you.

309
00:26:52,963 --> 00:26:54,383
Tomorrow is children's day.

310
00:26:54,613 --> 00:26:57,013
Yes, my grandmother gave me
 allowance when I came out.

311
00:26:57,963 --> 00:26:58,963
Goodness.

312
00:27:02,403 --> 00:27:03,683
What about identification?

313
00:27:06,503 --> 00:27:08,603
I'm contacting his family right now.

314
00:27:09,023 --> 00:27:10,273
What's the cause of death?

315
00:27:10,733 --> 00:27:12,523
I think he broke his neck because he got beaten.

316
00:27:14,553 --> 00:27:16,133
He's still young though.

317
00:27:19,953 --> 00:27:21,993
I really hate blood.

318
00:27:24,893 --> 00:27:26,413
It's really amazing here.

319
00:27:30,513 --> 00:27:31,833
Huh?

320
00:27:32,863 --> 00:27:34,313
It's a woman.

321
00:27:54,593 --> 00:27:55,853
There will be more, right?

322
00:27:59,293 --> 00:28:01,563
I can't just go back to Busan...

323
00:28:02,823 --> 00:28:03,853
You can't do that.

324
00:28:11,373 --> 00:28:12,623
Hi!

325
00:28:14,643 --> 00:28:17,463
He's been the director for three generations.

326
00:28:18,073 --> 00:28:20,093
It feels like the third generation, right?

327
00:28:20,483 --> 00:28:22,673
- Dongsu-hyung!  
- Dongsu-hyung!

328
00:28:22,913 --> 00:28:24,093
- How are you?  - Dongsu-hyung!

329
00:28:24,093 --> 00:28:25,513
- Hi, how are you?
- Hello.

330
00:28:25,513 --> 00:28:27,433
- Brother, I'll show you this!
- It's Dongsu-hyung.

331
00:28:27,723 --> 00:28:29,353
- Hey, it's Dongsu-hyung.
- Dongsu-hyung? Dongsu- hyung?

332
00:28:29,853 --> 00:28:32,143
- Wow, it's Dongsu-hyung!
- Dongsu-hyung.

333
00:28:32,313 --> 00:28:33,933
Dongsu-hyung!

334
00:28:34,243 --> 00:28:35,813
Wow, it's Dongsu-hyung!

335
00:28:36,803 --> 00:28:38,733
Really? Is it true?

336
00:28:45,323 --> 00:28:47,203
That's why you wanted to come here.

337
00:28:47,203 --> 00:28:49,033
Hey, didn't you just call and come?

338
00:28:49,903 --> 00:28:52,813
But has it been down a bit?

339
00:28:53,713 --> 00:28:56,643
3 people in a year and a half.

340
00:28:57,303 --> 00:29:00,133
Man, I lose 450 a month.

341
00:29:00,133 --> 00:29:02,133
With a subsidy. 
You kids now go and play.

342
00:29:02,243 --> 00:29:03,673
- Let's go play.
- Let's go.

343
00:29:03,713 --> 00:29:06,133
Hey, the losing team gets a finger flick, okay?

344
00:29:06,773 --> 00:29:08,013
Hurry up!

345
00:29:09,833 --> 00:29:10,933
What?

346
00:29:14,933 --> 00:29:16,603
He got a new wife.

347
00:29:17,473 --> 00:29:20,153
Hey, aren't she too young?

348
00:29:20,373 --> 00:29:21,733
Huh? How did they meet?

349
00:29:22,113 --> 00:29:24,803
Well, a meeting application or
 something like that?

350
00:29:24,803 --> 00:29:27,393
Hey, you! Gosh, hey!

351
00:29:28,283 --> 00:29:30,993
Hey, you idiot, I told
you not to go in there, hey!

352
00:29:31,123 --> 00:29:32,463
Can't you see that flower?

353
00:29:32,463 --> 00:29:34,543
- How many times will I tell you! Kiddo. 
- Dongsu-hyung! Let's play basketball together.

354
00:29:34,713 --> 00:29:35,963
- Yeah.
- Come quickly.

355
00:29:35,963 --> 00:29:37,583
Nice, nice.

356
00:29:40,683 --> 00:29:43,893
Team leader, last time, to the section chief,

357
00:29:44,093 --> 00:29:48,613
You said that this is the infant sale
that the church is doing as a community...

358
00:29:48,613 --> 00:29:50,103
We're on the same church.

359
00:29:50,723 --> 00:29:52,853
That young man is
also a church employee.

360
00:29:52,853 --> 00:29:53,973
But it's a part-time job.

361
00:29:55,193 --> 00:29:57,953
He's an employee, but I'm a non-regular worker.

362
00:29:59,833 --> 00:30:02,553
It's a bit too much for
a professional broker.

363
00:30:02,933 --> 00:30:04,783
Some things are difficult to do...

364
00:30:08,433 --> 00:30:11,203
You put lukewarm water
in this, don't you? Am I right?

365
00:30:14,103 --> 00:30:16,043
It's because you didn't wait for 3 minutes.

366
00:30:17,833 --> 00:30:21,543
If you sell and get paid, you're a
professional broker, aren't you?

367
00:30:23,493 --> 00:30:25,343
That's right though...

368
00:30:27,493 --> 00:30:31,213
I think that the organization behind
the scenes is a bit too far-fetched.

369
00:30:32,433 --> 00:30:36,663
You don't want to hear the detective 
department being sarcastic to us, do you?

370
00:30:38,753 --> 00:30:39,843
Give it to me!

371
00:30:40,913 --> 00:30:41,983
Give me the ball.

372
00:30:43,913 --> 00:30:45,483
No no!

373
00:30:45,483 --> 00:30:47,323
- That's not the goal! that's not goal!
- Yoon Woo-ya

374
00:30:47,453 --> 00:30:48,403
Yes?

375
00:30:48,473 --> 00:30:50,933
You, please lend that to Hajun.

376
00:30:51,763 --> 00:30:53,653
Haejin, stop playing soccer.

377
00:30:53,653 --> 00:30:55,043
Five minutes more!

378
00:30:56,823 --> 00:30:58,843
He's not very good at it, that kid.

379
00:31:04,833 --> 00:31:07,053
That wound of yours won't go away.

380
00:31:10,453 --> 00:31:12,803
You bled so much back then, and you

381
00:31:13,283 --> 00:31:15,473
I called an ambulance and
it wasn't even a fuss, man.

382
00:31:16,733 --> 00:31:18,733
There was a kite on the branch

383
00:31:18,813 --> 00:31:21,093
I was going to grab it, 
but it broke so fast...

384
00:31:23,553 --> 00:31:26,023
Youngmin is the only
troublemaker like that.

385
00:31:27,413 --> 00:31:28,443
Youngmin?

386
00:31:29,773 --> 00:31:31,243
Oh, Youngmin?

387
00:31:31,993 --> 00:31:33,493
He's escaping now.

388
00:31:33,933 --> 00:31:34,953
Again?

389
00:31:37,593 --> 00:31:39,543
It's just like the old days.

390
00:31:52,873 --> 00:31:54,223
I didn't hear from you.

391
00:31:55,043 --> 00:31:56,303
I'm sorry.

392
00:31:58,623 --> 00:32:01,893
Now I'm not here for
anything in particular.

393
00:32:09,673 --> 00:32:13,823
Yes, well, at first, it felt
like seeing the line once.

394
00:32:14,293 --> 00:32:15,393
Tow.

395
00:32:15,643 --> 00:32:17,743
Yeah, then I'll take a picture
and send it to you, yeah.

396
00:32:21,063 --> 00:32:24,623
Your eyebrows are a bit thin, huh?

397
00:32:28,443 --> 00:32:30,803
Excuse me for a second.

398
00:32:35,153 --> 00:32:37,133
- That's wierd.
- Huh?

399
00:32:38,393 --> 00:32:41,753
Why? If you do it like this, 
he looks so manly.

400
00:32:42,543 --> 00:32:44,313
But why am I your wife?

401
00:32:47,943 --> 00:32:50,153
- Dongsu knows everyone here.
- Oh, it's a baby.

402
00:32:50,163 --> 00:32:51,643
Then you can call me your daughter.

403
00:32:51,663 --> 00:32:53,333
<i>So cute.</i>

404
00:32:55,263 --> 00:32:57,123
We don't look alike at all.

405
00:32:57,633 --> 00:32:59,533
Hey, kid, don't touch him.

406
00:32:59,543 --> 00:33:00,993
With your hands touching the ball.

407
00:33:01,453 --> 00:33:03,123
I said don't touch him.

408
00:33:03,143 --> 00:33:05,423
And I'm doing this until 
someone comes to buy him.

409
00:33:05,423 --> 00:33:08,653
No matter what I told you,
don't touch him like that!

410
00:33:09,653 --> 00:33:10,923
With your hands touching the ball.

411
00:33:11,293 --> 00:33:12,883
He has a weird eyebrows.

412
00:33:20,793 --> 00:33:22,523
Can't I be your son?

413
00:33:23,003 --> 00:33:23,983
Why?

414
00:33:25,193 --> 00:33:26,523
I want to play soccer.

415
00:33:26,803 --> 00:33:27,813
Soccer?

416
00:33:28,013 --> 00:33:31,193
I want to make a lot of
money like Son Heung-min.

417
00:33:31,623 --> 00:33:34,653
Uncle Woosung was
born not long ago...

418
00:33:35,363 --> 00:33:38,453
Well, a second one is still a bit, isn't it?

419
00:33:38,813 --> 00:33:41,203
Yeah, one is enough.

420
00:33:42,293 --> 00:33:44,533
That would be a good suggestion.

421
00:33:47,983 --> 00:33:51,503
The kid who grew up here once
became a professional soccer player.

422
00:33:51,603 --> 00:33:53,593
He, what did he say...

423
00:33:53,613 --> 00:33:55,823
The one who has the striped uniform.

424
00:33:56,123 --> 00:33:57,223
I don't know.

425
00:33:58,233 --> 00:34:01,173
Well, at a nursery school, even
people from here can succeed.

426
00:34:01,173 --> 00:34:02,333
I'm just promoting it but

427
00:34:03,333 --> 00:34:06,063
- 97%
- He's pretending to know again.

428
00:34:07,513 --> 00:34:09,693
- 3% would be great.
- What a kid.

429
00:34:10,153 --> 00:34:12,403
Look at how you get angry again
for talking about the nursery school.

430
00:34:12,693 --> 00:34:15,033
What percentage of
people usually succeed...

431
00:34:18,053 --> 00:34:19,243
Who are you?

432
00:34:20,543 --> 00:34:23,793
One escaped. 
He must have been caught and dragged.

433
00:34:25,163 --> 00:34:27,373
I broke Dongsu-hyung's record!

434
00:34:29,423 --> 00:34:31,603
It took me three days to get caught!

435
00:34:32,573 --> 00:34:33,803
I'm proud of you.

436
00:34:34,203 --> 00:34:37,263
No, in terms of time and
distance, I'm farther away...

437
00:34:39,233 --> 00:34:41,393
You're really good for you.

438
00:34:41,393 --> 00:34:42,923
Yes, hello?

439
00:34:43,973 --> 00:34:48,063
<i>Okay, I got it
You're talking about Uljin, right?</i>

440
00:34:48,403 --> 00:34:50,103
<i>- No, no, that's fine.</i>
- What?

441
00:34:50,773 --> 00:34:52,443
<i>- See you tomorrow.</i>
- What's with your eyebrows?

442
00:34:54,613 --> 00:34:57,333
Seafood doenjang is here.

443
00:35:02,773 --> 00:35:05,703
- Hey, the coin laundry...
- Oh, hyung, and

444
00:35:05,893 --> 00:35:07,163
This is my junior Siwoo.

445
00:35:07,163 --> 00:35:08,363
- I was the forward.
- Siwoo.

446
00:35:08,363 --> 00:35:11,033
- He was a midfielder.
- Can you put him back?

447
00:35:11,303 --> 00:35:14,743
Back then, man, I would
have made two soccer teams

448
00:35:14,743 --> 00:35:16,423
- Isn't it?
- Right now...

449
00:35:16,433 --> 00:35:18,093
- If I'm going to coach you,
- The pants are shortened

450
00:35:18,093 --> 00:35:19,173
Put it down again.

451
00:35:19,183 --> 00:35:20,293
Two or three nurseries should be combined

452
00:35:20,293 --> 00:35:20,923
- 11 people...
- My knees are tired.

453
00:35:20,923 --> 00:35:22,923
- You don't sew the lining, huh?
- No, no one.

454
00:35:24,623 --> 00:35:27,183
You know the law, adoption...

455
00:35:27,183 --> 00:35:29,683
Yes, the adoption law.

456
00:35:30,363 --> 00:35:33,593
Thanks to you, the conditions for overseas adoption
have become stricter, so I thought it would be fine.

457
00:35:33,733 --> 00:35:36,193
But don't all the kids
want to be adopted?

458
00:35:37,413 --> 00:35:38,863
Well, who knows...

459
00:35:39,173 --> 00:35:42,203
That kid who likes
soccer, he was very active.

460
00:35:42,203 --> 00:35:44,063
Yes, Haejin.

461
00:35:45,433 --> 00:35:47,413
He's already late.

462
00:35:48,013 --> 00:35:49,253
He's 7 years old.

463
00:35:49,703 --> 00:35:50,713
He's 8 years old.

464
00:35:50,713 --> 00:35:52,833
Oh, it's late, he's late.

465
00:35:53,433 --> 00:35:54,333
He's late.

466
00:35:54,333 --> 00:35:57,503
That, adoption, well, that one...

467
00:35:57,513 --> 00:36:00,513
I guess it's until he's 6 years old.

468
00:36:00,563 --> 00:36:03,683
Well, he himself knows well...

469
00:36:06,253 --> 00:36:09,473
Gosh, there are kids who
come because they don't like it.

470
00:36:09,703 --> 00:36:13,273
You know, it happened a few days ago, that's why

471
00:36:13,493 --> 00:36:15,553
The adopted child was abused.

472
00:36:17,583 --> 00:36:19,573
Because blood is thicker than water.

473
00:36:20,093 --> 00:36:21,993
After being adopted

474
00:36:21,993 --> 00:36:24,433
How about having a
child born in that house?

475
00:36:25,453 --> 00:36:29,543
Yeah, most of the kids
here at least once, huh?

476
00:36:30,263 --> 00:36:34,123
You've been denied your existence
when you've been abandoned, right?

477
00:36:34,163 --> 00:36:36,123
But there again...

478
00:36:37,043 --> 00:36:40,213
Then I will continue
to live a life of denial.

479
00:36:40,463 --> 00:36:41,303
What?

480
00:36:41,463 --> 00:36:43,593
Then do something about the whistle.

481
00:36:43,593 --> 00:36:44,973
It's not like the military.

482
00:36:45,803 --> 00:36:46,803
- Hey.
- Whistle.

483
00:36:47,373 --> 00:36:49,813
I'm like, huh?

484
00:36:50,683 --> 00:36:54,063
I want to be something
like a father to them.

485
00:36:54,173 --> 00:36:55,273
Got it?

486
00:36:55,493 --> 00:36:59,773
So this whistle, huh?
I'm doing this, huh?

487
00:37:07,123 --> 00:37:08,533
Hey, hide quickly!

488
00:37:21,983 --> 00:37:27,093
Sleep well, my baby

489
00:37:29,083 --> 00:37:34,873
In the front yard and back garden

490
00:37:36,083 --> 00:37:41,423
Birds and baby sheep

491
00:37:43,063 --> 00:37:48,013
Everyone is sleeping

492
00:38:09,083 --> 00:38:10,353
I sang.

493
00:38:11,123 --> 00:38:12,223
What song?

494
00:38:13,553 --> 00:38:14,773
A lullaby.

495
00:38:15,743 --> 00:38:17,193
Lullaby?

496
00:38:22,753 --> 00:38:25,653
It's so good that there's nothing here.

497
00:38:26,533 --> 00:38:28,283
Let's take all of them.

498
00:38:29,893 --> 00:38:31,283
Rub his earlobe like this.

499
00:38:31,983 --> 00:38:33,743
That's a lot of talk...

500
00:38:35,663 --> 00:38:36,663
Well, if you look for more

501
00:38:36,663 --> 00:38:38,963
There must be a better match...

502
00:38:39,213 --> 00:38:41,083
Let's just go with people who cried easily.

503
00:38:41,573 --> 00:38:44,133
Goodnes, well done.

504
00:38:44,653 --> 00:38:47,263
Oh my, you had a good bath.

505
00:38:47,723 --> 00:38:50,713
Your mom wants to say bye to you soon.

506
00:38:52,203 --> 00:38:53,613
We work so hard...

507
00:38:53,613 --> 00:38:55,533
Do you know how difficult it
is to raise a child by yourself?

508
00:38:57,013 --> 00:38:58,963
But throwing away one's
own children like that

509
00:38:58,963 --> 00:39:00,273
You can't justify it.

510
00:39:00,273 --> 00:39:01,943
How would you justify selling kids?

511
00:39:02,093 --> 00:39:04,753
There are people who throw them
away, so there are people who sell them.

512
00:39:04,753 --> 00:39:06,363
The order has to be right.

513
00:39:06,693 --> 00:39:10,283
Then you shouldn't
have made a box like that.

514
00:39:10,283 --> 00:39:12,233
That's what I mean, huh?

515
00:39:12,233 --> 00:39:14,493
Thinking about saving the baby. What do you know?

516
00:39:14,493 --> 00:39:16,753
In the end, all I have to do is 
make them feel comfortable.

517
00:39:16,753 --> 00:39:19,213
It's not like that,
thanks to that box

518
00:39:19,213 --> 00:39:21,413
Woosung is alive like this.

519
00:39:21,733 --> 00:39:24,453
It has alcohol in it, 
you can't wipe his face with that.

520
00:39:24,453 --> 00:39:25,833
He's crying.

521
00:39:27,633 --> 00:39:28,883
Sorry, sorry.

522
00:39:28,883 --> 00:39:30,933
Then I'll leave a letter.

523
00:39:31,303 --> 00:39:33,333
How many moms do you
think will come to pick me up?

524
00:39:33,343 --> 00:39:34,723
How do I know?

525
00:39:35,613 --> 00:39:37,523
It's one out of forty.

526
00:39:37,823 --> 00:39:40,143
The other 39 people
never contacted me again.

527
00:39:40,673 --> 00:39:44,273
Why do you only say something to your mom?
Tell the fathers the same thing.

528
00:39:44,273 --> 00:39:46,903
Then, at least leave your
contact information in the letter.

529
00:39:47,303 --> 00:39:49,223
I'm already hearing that for the second time.

530
00:39:49,513 --> 00:39:51,493
Why? Should I tell you again?

531
00:39:51,993 --> 00:39:53,413
I can tell you as many times as I want.

532
00:39:53,413 --> 00:39:55,163
Who are you to be so bossy?

533
00:39:55,303 --> 00:39:57,373
Since the kids are calling you hyung
at this pathetic nursery school,

534
00:39:57,373 --> 00:39:58,333
Do you think you can do anything?

535
00:39:58,333 --> 00:40:00,963
Are you proud?
Just live here, then.

536
00:40:10,883 --> 00:40:13,133
Oh my, it's cold.

537
00:40:13,313 --> 00:40:14,663
Woosung...

538
00:40:14,663 --> 00:40:18,143
I thought her mother would be one in forty

539
00:40:18,463 --> 00:40:20,463
If you look at the playground,

540
00:40:21,173 --> 00:40:23,273
There's an old door, right? Over there.

541
00:40:23,273 --> 00:40:25,653
I guess he was left there.

542
00:40:25,863 --> 00:40:28,613
With a letter saying, 
"I'll come back to pick you up."

543
00:40:28,833 --> 00:40:31,823
Don't be so abrupt, 
so please cut me some slack.

544
00:40:42,373 --> 00:40:44,223
Jiyoung was working.

545
00:40:45,253 --> 00:40:46,583
He's back.

546
00:40:47,863 --> 00:40:49,413
It's easy to say, what a singer...

547
00:40:52,533 --> 00:40:55,013
I liked his voice though.

548
00:40:56,733 --> 00:40:57,883
3 to 1.

549
00:41:05,583 --> 00:41:06,733
But what...

550
00:41:07,413 --> 00:41:09,363
We'll all settle down here.

551
00:41:13,443 --> 00:41:15,113
But it's going to be fun.

552
00:41:15,773 --> 00:41:17,963
- Yes!
- 4 to 1.

553
00:41:20,893 --> 00:41:22,163
Fun?

554
00:41:26,733 --> 00:41:29,633
It's more fun than being alone.

555
00:41:33,453 --> 00:41:34,723
But still

556
00:41:36,123 --> 00:41:40,263
Go away bro, over there!

557
00:41:44,023 --> 00:41:45,443
Far away, where?

558
00:41:45,673 --> 00:41:46,663
Far.

559
00:41:48,193 --> 00:41:52,733
You are our children's hope
and our children are the stars.

560
00:41:55,133 --> 00:41:56,913
Where are you going...

561
00:41:57,803 --> 00:41:59,343
Anywhere.

562
00:42:00,983 --> 00:42:05,203
I think it'll be sad if you come back, really.

563
00:43:22,353 --> 00:43:23,873
Good morning.

564
00:43:35,523 --> 00:43:38,093
Woo Sung-ah, it's raining.

565
00:43:39,083 --> 00:43:40,093
It's a rain.

566
00:43:40,973 --> 00:43:42,843
It's a raindrops.

567
00:43:44,543 --> 00:43:45,893
It's just the same.

568
00:43:58,943 --> 00:44:00,533
I'm sorry about yesterday.

569
00:44:02,513 --> 00:44:04,103
I was too harsh.

570
00:44:06,283 --> 00:44:07,913
What did you say?

571
00:44:14,083 --> 00:44:16,003
I dream sometimes.

572
00:44:19,043 --> 00:44:20,723
It's raining...

573
00:44:23,093 --> 00:44:26,593
The rain washed
me clean until yesterday.

574
00:44:31,963 --> 00:44:34,023
But when I open my eyes

575
00:44:35,413 --> 00:44:38,983
It's still raining like a downpour.

576
00:44:42,943 --> 00:44:44,783
Nothing has changed for me.

577
00:44:47,133 --> 00:44:48,993
Wouldn't it be okay if you had an umbrella?

578
00:44:50,953 --> 00:44:52,123
Umbrella?

579
00:44:54,843 --> 00:44:57,383
Yes, a big umbrella.

580
00:44:59,693 --> 00:45:01,453
Something that two people can use...

581
00:45:11,123 --> 00:45:13,233
Don't do it!

582
00:45:13,923 --> 00:45:18,153
I hope it's color red. 
The one with strawberries drawing on it.

583
00:45:20,303 --> 00:45:22,993
When I was young, 
my friend had something like that.

584
00:45:23,903 --> 00:45:25,823
I was so jealous of that.

585
00:45:28,453 --> 00:45:29,583
Did you steal it?

586
00:45:30,303 --> 00:45:33,193
Yes, I took it and threw away.

587
00:46:14,643 --> 00:46:16,663
But they're not related by blood, are they?

588
00:46:16,863 --> 00:46:19,293
Yes, everyone
calls her Mom, but...

589
00:46:19,403 --> 00:46:20,483
Everyone?

590
00:46:21,623 --> 00:46:23,723
I wake up and it's
my grandpa's house.

591
00:46:23,723 --> 00:46:25,803
I was surprised
and couldn't sleep.

592
00:46:25,843 --> 00:46:27,153
What is this?

593
00:46:27,153 --> 00:46:28,723
No, I saw a police car 
coming to them like this.

594
00:46:28,723 --> 00:46:31,013
- What happened? Yes?
- Quiet, please quiet.

595
00:46:32,243 --> 00:46:34,723
- Hey, come here!
- Hold on a second.

596
00:46:37,063 --> 00:46:38,853
No, that...

597
00:46:39,483 --> 00:46:43,403
I've never seen him.
What's going on?

598
00:46:44,303 --> 00:46:47,533
He was killed at the hotel, then...

599
00:46:49,123 --> 00:46:50,283
Take a good look.

600
00:46:51,453 --> 00:46:55,703
It's a picture taken from the hotel
CCTV, this girl lives here, right?

601
00:46:56,903 --> 00:46:58,003
Yeji.

602
00:46:58,783 --> 00:47:00,463
Get the kids over there.

603
00:47:01,133 --> 00:47:03,043
In front of the kids...

604
00:47:05,103 --> 00:47:06,803
Wait a minute, tall kid.

605
00:47:06,953 --> 00:47:08,553
Tall kid, wait a minute.

606
00:47:09,833 --> 00:47:11,763
Here, a candy.

607
00:47:14,893 --> 00:47:18,103
Can I talk to you comfortably?

608
00:47:19,153 --> 00:47:21,483
Is this the older
sister who lives here?

609
00:47:24,293 --> 00:47:25,733
I don't know.

610
00:47:34,013 --> 00:47:35,453
Excuse, ma'am.

611
00:47:35,643 --> 00:47:39,463
The one here, this kid here is a baby, isn't he?

612
00:47:39,733 --> 00:47:43,983
I told her not to give birth
How can that girl become a mother?

613
00:47:44,513 --> 00:47:46,073
What? What did you say?

614
00:47:46,493 --> 00:47:49,923
Gosh, I said
I told her not to give birth!

615
00:47:49,933 --> 00:47:52,453
How can a girl like that become a mother?

616
00:47:55,113 --> 00:47:56,693
Jeong-suk! Jeong-suk!

617
00:47:59,393 --> 00:48:02,233
This is what you do
with the kids, this is...

618
00:48:02,523 --> 00:48:03,903
Are you like a mother?

619
00:48:05,693 --> 00:48:07,193
I...

620
00:48:07,513 --> 00:48:11,863
I was just taking the kids out of
the way and looking after them.

621
00:48:13,533 --> 00:48:14,753
Murder?

622
00:48:18,413 --> 00:48:20,013
You mean prostitution?

623
00:48:24,653 --> 00:48:26,173
That is to say...

624
00:48:26,523 --> 00:48:29,033
She need to run away, but
the baby got in her way.

625
00:48:32,963 --> 00:48:37,563
Give me three days, I'll make
sure they sell it within that time.

626
00:48:50,523 --> 00:48:52,783
If it's murder, the detective department will move?

627
00:48:52,783 --> 00:48:54,493
They're already moving.

628
00:48:56,893 --> 00:48:58,163
I should set it up.

629
00:48:58,933 --> 00:48:59,993
Setting?

630
00:49:01,263 --> 00:49:02,293
As a buyer.

631
00:49:17,813 --> 00:49:20,393
- Now you're calling...
- Aww, damn...

632
00:49:20,453 --> 00:49:22,583
Se's not picking up, Uljin.

633
00:49:22,833 --> 00:49:26,563
Oh, that's because I sent a
picture with his eyebrows like this.

634
00:49:27,723 --> 00:49:28,903
What do you think of this?

635
00:49:29,493 --> 00:49:30,593
20 million won.

636
00:49:31,553 --> 00:49:33,133
Twice the market price...

637
00:49:34,103 --> 00:49:35,283
Do you want to meet her?

638
00:49:35,283 --> 00:49:36,703
Oh? Who?

639
00:49:36,973 --> 00:49:38,373
I think it's the owner of the building.

640
00:49:40,843 --> 00:49:42,333
How old are is that woman?

641
00:49:43,023 --> 00:49:44,213
36 years old.

642
00:49:44,233 --> 00:49:46,713
- Why?
- You wish she were younger?

643
00:49:47,933 --> 00:49:49,503
No, not like that.

644
00:49:52,163 --> 00:49:54,173
I have a somewhat
 ominous feeling though.

645
00:49:58,273 --> 00:50:01,503
But isn't it a bit cheap?

646
00:50:03,543 --> 00:50:04,823
Ten million won?

647
00:50:07,033 --> 00:50:09,423
The market price for a baby.

648
00:50:10,833 --> 00:50:12,983
Even a girl costs 8 million won.

649
00:50:12,983 --> 00:50:14,823
- Team Leader.
- What?

650
00:50:15,893 --> 00:50:17,413
To provoke the crime

651
00:50:17,413 --> 00:50:18,593
- Using the bait...
- 2 million won.

652
00:50:18,593 --> 00:50:20,393
- Isn't that illegal?
- What's the difference?

653
00:50:20,393 --> 00:50:21,733
I'm getting annoyed.

654
00:50:24,803 --> 00:50:26,083
What did you say?

655
00:50:26,693 --> 00:50:30,873
I've learned that it won't even
be taken up as evidence in the trial

656
00:50:34,493 --> 00:50:36,223
The crime was intentional from the beginning.

657
00:50:37,063 --> 00:50:39,143
This is not a crime.

658
00:50:41,183 --> 00:50:42,593
It's an opportunity.

659
00:50:43,553 --> 00:50:44,693
Opportunity...

660
00:50:47,103 --> 00:50:50,003
Ah, Tess-hyung, Sokra...

661
00:50:50,053 --> 00:50:52,983
Hey, when we get
a contract, there...

662
00:50:53,133 --> 00:50:56,573
From Busan over there,
over there, over there?

663
00:50:57,403 --> 00:50:59,283
Shall we go see Jennifer again?

664
00:50:59,873 --> 00:51:00,863
I don't want to, go alone.

665
00:51:00,863 --> 00:51:03,783
- I'm not very interested in those stores.
- Keep it quiet, you bastard...

666
00:51:04,323 --> 00:51:08,123
Even in this kind of situation, you're
good at making useless noises like that.

667
00:51:08,493 --> 00:51:11,293
Well, let's relax the
atmosphere for a moment.

668
00:51:11,683 --> 00:51:14,383
Even in the military,
before soldiers go to training

669
00:51:14,383 --> 00:51:17,173
Hyung, you didn't even go to the
military because you were in a cell.

670
00:51:17,173 --> 00:51:20,223
You haven't been there either.
Those from an orphanage are exempt.

671
00:51:20,733 --> 00:51:23,353
I'm on the same level as the gold medalist.

672
00:51:24,423 --> 00:51:28,363
Why is love like this again?

673
00:51:39,763 --> 00:51:40,913
What's wrong?

674
00:51:45,643 --> 00:51:47,563
Why do you park your car like this?

675
00:51:49,643 --> 00:51:51,183
Oh, I think I'm going to pee.

676
00:51:52,383 --> 00:51:54,023
Oh, I think I'm really going to pee.

677
00:51:55,363 --> 00:51:56,673
That kid...

678
00:52:08,123 --> 00:52:11,603
I told you I had
a ominous feeling.

679
00:52:12,733 --> 00:52:14,233
Is that feeling this feeling?

680
00:52:24,463 --> 00:52:27,793
It was shaking so much that
I almost pee in a little bit.

681
00:52:32,753 --> 00:52:34,043
This car stinks.

682
00:52:37,073 --> 00:52:39,593
You ride as you please
and talk what you want.

683
00:52:40,383 --> 00:52:43,543
Uncle, can't you take me too?

684
00:52:43,553 --> 00:52:46,683
No, everyone will be worried.

685
00:52:47,223 --> 00:52:49,893
I'll give you money, so you
go back on the bus by yourself.

686
00:52:50,003 --> 00:52:51,023
No.

687
00:52:55,203 --> 00:52:57,983
I mean, why are you
interrupting our family trip?

688
00:52:58,493 --> 00:53:00,823
I know everything.
That you're not a family.

689
00:53:00,973 --> 00:53:02,703
You're trying to sell Woosung.

690
00:53:04,193 --> 00:53:06,533
- How far did you hear it?
- Everything.

691
00:53:12,443 --> 00:53:15,443
Please be careful.
I'll put it here.

692
00:53:16,553 --> 00:53:19,483
What is important is that the
baby has thin hair or small eyes.

693
00:53:19,483 --> 00:53:21,673
Please don't say
such negative things.

694
00:53:22,173 --> 00:53:24,973
And please don't even ask the
baby's mother about her father.

695
00:53:24,973 --> 00:53:26,833
- There must be something.
- Yes.

696
00:53:27,783 --> 00:53:30,143
- Have some coffee.
- Yes, thank you, I will drink.

697
00:53:30,333 --> 00:53:31,683
Thank you.

698
00:53:33,773 --> 00:53:36,233
Do I look like the owner of the building?

699
00:53:38,093 --> 00:53:40,023
Aren't you a little young?

700
00:53:40,973 --> 00:53:42,053
I'm sorry.

701
00:53:42,863 --> 00:53:45,073
It's okay, there's no need to apologize.

702
00:53:45,073 --> 00:53:46,113
Ah, yes.

703
00:53:46,313 --> 00:53:49,373
Then since you're actually married,

704
00:53:49,723 --> 00:53:51,353
You are setting without 
marriage registration.

705
00:53:52,623 --> 00:53:55,213
- That's why formal adoption is difficult.
- Yes.

706
00:53:55,213 --> 00:53:56,343
Yes.

707
00:53:58,363 --> 00:54:01,113
The sperm count is a bit low.

708
00:54:02,463 --> 00:54:03,613
Me?

709
00:54:05,933 --> 00:54:08,013
"Above all, just give me the
money quickly", be very naturally.

710
00:54:08,013 --> 00:54:10,153
I see, the sperm count
is low and naturally...

711
00:54:10,153 --> 00:54:13,183
There's not enough sperm and the money......

712
00:54:13,573 --> 00:54:17,523
Then, let's do a dialogue here.

713
00:54:17,523 --> 00:54:18,693
Yes, alright.

714
00:54:20,283 --> 00:54:23,153
And here's the money we have prepared.

715
00:54:26,643 --> 00:54:29,243
It's already been 5 years since 
I got infertility treatment.

716
00:54:29,703 --> 00:54:32,203
We're both very tired.

717
00:54:32,813 --> 00:54:36,873
Well, Detective, in this part,
Why don't we talk about a real marriage?

718
00:54:36,883 --> 00:54:38,453
Because I didn't get married properly

719
00:54:38,453 --> 00:54:40,213
Official adoption is a little bit
different, something like this...

720
00:54:40,213 --> 00:54:41,593
Okay, let's go with that.

721
00:54:42,173 --> 00:54:43,133
Thank you.

722
00:54:45,903 --> 00:54:49,473
We will cherish him
like our real children.

723
00:54:51,973 --> 00:54:54,813
Shall we remove the "real"
thing from "our real" thing?

724
00:54:54,813 --> 00:54:56,023
Oh, shall we remove the "real" thing?

725
00:54:56,403 --> 00:54:58,123
Oh yeah, except for the "real" thing, yes.

726
00:54:58,763 --> 00:55:00,783
Let's cherish our children 
I mean...

727
00:55:00,783 --> 00:55:03,073
We cherish our children...

728
00:55:03,843 --> 00:55:05,053
- What did I say?
- Cherish.

729
00:55:05,053 --> 00:55:05,943
Oh right.

730
00:55:06,253 --> 00:55:08,763
<i>We cherish our children...</i>

731
00:55:08,853 --> 00:55:10,933
Like our children...

732
00:55:11,503 --> 00:55:14,033
We will cherish it.

733
00:55:21,953 --> 00:55:26,903
Let's get serious,
let's go get serious.

734
00:55:26,903 --> 00:55:29,133
Let's get serious.

735
00:55:29,443 --> 00:55:32,013
Oh, but can I call
this car Haejin-ho?

736
00:55:32,583 --> 00:55:34,473
Sure, do what you want.

737
00:55:34,473 --> 00:55:35,643
Yeah!

738
00:55:36,123 --> 00:55:39,643
But Jennifer? Who is Jennifer?

739
00:55:40,543 --> 00:55:42,223
Your Dongsu-hyung's girlfriend.

740
00:55:44,833 --> 00:55:46,903
Hey, but what's written here?

741
00:55:46,903 --> 00:55:47,943
- Oh, this?
- Yes.

742
00:55:47,943 --> 00:55:48,933
Haejin.

743
00:55:48,933 --> 00:55:51,283
It's my name, the
pastor gave it to me.

744
00:55:53,083 --> 00:55:55,993
I think you really
like your name.

745
00:55:56,103 --> 00:55:57,373
No.

746
00:55:57,633 --> 00:56:00,373
That's how you don't disappear from the nursery.

747
00:56:00,563 --> 00:56:04,253
If you're trying to steal something, you'll 
steal everything with your name on it.

748
00:56:04,253 --> 00:56:06,503
- <i>9388, stop to the right.</i>
- Right?

749
00:56:09,093 --> 00:56:11,263
<i>9388, turn right.</i>

750
00:56:11,263 --> 00:56:13,973
What? I didn't even speed up.

751
00:56:14,243 --> 00:56:17,413
Damn it, huh?

752
00:56:22,903 --> 00:56:24,353
You're the wife...

753
00:56:25,643 --> 00:56:28,823
So let's assume that the two of
them are a couple in our store.

754
00:56:28,823 --> 00:56:30,823
I hate it, couple my ass.

755
00:56:31,043 --> 00:56:31,923
I hate it too.

756
00:56:31,953 --> 00:56:33,453
Then let's call it a relative. A distant relative

757
00:56:33,453 --> 00:56:34,993
- Understand?
- How much? six cousin? eight cousin?

758
00:56:35,323 --> 00:56:36,283
- That's important...
- Hello.

759
00:56:36,283 --> 00:56:37,283
Good job, yes

760
00:56:37,503 --> 00:56:38,543
Your license, please.

761
00:56:38,863 --> 00:56:40,043
Yes.

762
00:56:40,573 --> 00:56:43,333
I didn't get that much speed...

763
00:56:44,323 --> 00:56:45,713
Mr. Ha Jin-young.

764
00:56:46,273 --> 00:56:47,883
The car door was open in the back.

765
00:56:47,883 --> 00:56:50,913
If the loads inside are spilled, the
car behind will have a serious accident.

766
00:56:51,173 --> 00:56:52,223
I'm sorry.

767
00:56:57,843 --> 00:56:59,433
Are you all going together somewhere?

768
00:56:59,713 --> 00:57:00,603
Yes!

769
00:57:00,603 --> 00:57:02,813
We're going to Lotte World
 to ride a ferris wheel.

770
00:57:02,813 --> 00:57:04,523
Hey, you're going far, aren't you?

771
00:57:04,523 --> 00:57:05,853
Yes, I'm going on a family trip.

772
00:57:05,853 --> 00:57:08,073
But there's no ferris wheel there.

773
00:57:08,073 --> 00:57:09,153
Really?

774
00:57:10,063 --> 00:57:11,943
To ride the Ferris wheel

775
00:57:12,093 --> 00:57:13,403
You need to go to Wolmido.

776
00:57:13,763 --> 00:57:15,993
So shall we go to Wolmido?

777
00:57:15,993 --> 00:57:16,953
- When the time comes.
- Yes!

778
00:57:16,953 --> 00:57:19,373
Ask daddy to take you 
for a ride on the cruise ship too.

779
00:57:19,623 --> 00:57:22,413
- yes!
- I have a weak stomach.

780
00:57:22,563 --> 00:57:23,833
I get motion sickness...

781
00:57:24,693 --> 00:57:26,463
- Do you do laundry?
- Yes.

782
00:57:26,463 --> 00:57:28,703
No, this is the shirt
I checked out a while ago.

783
00:57:28,703 --> 00:57:30,633
It's all shriveled up
and why is it, this?

784
00:57:31,843 --> 00:57:34,603
You need to dry this
I just turned it around...

785
00:57:34,603 --> 00:57:35,513
Oh yeah?

786
00:57:35,513 --> 00:57:38,143
Gosh, there are too many
amateurs in all laundry these days.

787
00:57:38,143 --> 00:57:39,813
- Boss...
- You should take a look at this.

788
00:57:39,813 --> 00:57:41,103
- Dry this...
- Boss!

789
00:57:41,103 --> 00:57:42,993
- Why?
- I think you should go...

790
00:57:43,403 --> 00:57:44,853
- Yeah, yeah, then...
- The license, yeah.

791
00:57:44,853 --> 00:57:46,023
Yes, thank you.

792
00:57:46,213 --> 00:57:47,903
You must dry it next time.

793
00:57:47,903 --> 00:57:48,773
- Okay.
- Yes.

794
00:57:48,773 --> 00:57:50,023
- Have a good time.
- Yes.

795
00:57:52,263 --> 00:57:54,073
- In Wolmido.
- Yes.

796
00:58:06,983 --> 00:58:08,753
- Hey, hey, hello.
- Oh, yeah

797
00:58:08,753 --> 00:58:10,713
Sorry for being late.
Did you wait long?

798
00:58:10,713 --> 00:58:11,593
- No, no.
- No.

799
00:58:11,593 --> 00:58:12,883
We're just now, yes.

800
00:58:12,883 --> 00:58:13,633
- I see.
- Yes.

801
00:58:13,633 --> 00:58:15,553
This is Ha Sang-hyun.
Are you Song Ji-cheol?

802
00:58:15,553 --> 00:58:16,843
Yes, that's right, I am.

803
00:58:16,843 --> 00:58:18,973
- He, is he Woosung?
- Yes, yes.

804
00:58:19,973 --> 00:58:22,213
- Are you the mother?
- Yes.

805
00:58:22,213 --> 00:58:24,773
Can I hug that baby just once?

806
00:58:26,163 --> 00:58:27,953
Yes, hug him.

807
00:58:31,373 --> 00:58:33,263
I touched it, 
I touched it, honey!

808
00:58:33,423 --> 00:58:36,383
His facial features are so clear.

809
00:58:36,383 --> 00:58:37,323
- Can you see it? 
- Yes.

810
00:58:39,693 --> 00:58:41,703
Are you really going to raise him properly?

811
00:58:42,183 --> 00:58:45,203
Of course, we will
really cherish him.

812
00:58:45,203 --> 00:58:49,043
Even if your own child is born,
Are you still going to cherish him the same?

813
00:58:49,483 --> 00:58:50,543
Of course.

814
00:58:50,913 --> 00:58:52,083
- Really?
- Let's stop here.

815
00:58:52,083 --> 00:58:54,083
- I have to pay you quickly...
- Uh, it's true.

816
00:58:54,423 --> 00:58:55,313
Give the money, give the money...

817
00:58:55,313 --> 00:58:57,843
- And now the eyebrows...
- Are you going to continue your infertility treatment?

818
00:58:59,183 --> 00:59:02,263
We've already been through 5 years

819
00:59:02,263 --> 00:59:04,223
- We both...
- Both of us, both of us are tired.

820
00:59:04,223 --> 00:59:05,393
- Yes.
- And so, that..

821
00:59:05,393 --> 00:59:07,633
Since we're not
officially married...

822
00:59:07,793 --> 00:59:08,903
Honey...

823
00:59:09,243 --> 00:59:11,013
Have you tested for AMH?

824
00:59:12,053 --> 00:59:14,343
Or maybe HSG?

825
00:59:15,593 --> 00:59:17,653
- Yeah, well that, that one...
- Yeah.

826
00:59:18,933 --> 00:59:20,953
I guess Letrozole didn't work.

827
00:59:21,443 --> 00:59:24,703
Yes, letrozole has more
severe side effects, so I...

828
00:59:24,853 --> 00:59:28,463
It's so hard for me to watch
that, so I'm going to stop now.

829
00:59:29,513 --> 00:59:31,753
Letrozole is an ovulation inducer.

830
00:59:33,123 --> 00:59:35,303
Of course it won't work if you eat it.

831
00:59:36,993 --> 00:59:39,173
So, that sperm...

832
00:59:39,693 --> 00:59:42,183
No, I'm talking about ovulation inducers,
what kind of sperm is coming out?

833
00:59:42,183 --> 00:59:43,553
Come on, take this, 
take this, take it.

834
01:00:00,513 --> 01:00:02,993
That's just for resale, isn't it?

835
01:00:02,993 --> 01:00:04,373
I recognized it right away.

836
01:00:04,373 --> 01:00:05,883
Do you know reseller? reseller?

837
01:00:05,883 --> 01:00:07,463
Uh, Hae-jin, you can't open that window.

838
01:00:07,463 --> 01:00:08,333
- Who told them?
- Don't touch them.

839
01:00:08,333 --> 01:00:09,613
I did it for money

840
01:00:10,143 --> 01:00:12,523
But how do you know so
much about infertility treatment?

841
01:00:12,533 --> 01:00:14,123
Wow, there's a lot of bubbles.

842
01:00:14,443 --> 01:00:18,303
No, a similar thing happened last
year too, so hyung was fooled.

843
01:00:18,333 --> 01:00:20,963
Don't touch it. 
It's observation. Ob-observation.

844
01:00:21,233 --> 01:00:22,463
if you just let it go

845
01:00:22,463 --> 01:00:24,973
By now, Woosung is probably
going to another country...

846
01:00:24,973 --> 01:00:25,933
Hey!

847
01:00:25,933 --> 01:00:27,563
Hey, hey, close it, close it, man!

848
01:00:34,223 --> 01:00:36,313
Close it, man!
Hey, close it, quick!

849
01:01:03,263 --> 01:01:04,763
The baby will catch a cold.

850
01:01:05,013 --> 01:01:06,683
Let's deal with the things
behind us in moderation.

851
01:01:06,683 --> 01:01:08,063
Don't do it.

852
01:01:16,513 --> 01:01:18,523
But that license...

853
01:01:18,523 --> 01:01:19,573
What?

854
01:01:19,683 --> 01:01:21,153
That, what is Ha Jinyoung?

855
01:01:22,223 --> 01:01:25,493
The name Sanghyun is my
 nickname when I was in the army.

856
01:01:25,933 --> 01:01:29,303
So hyung, you didn't go
to the military, did you?

857
01:01:29,683 --> 01:01:31,243
Figure it out, kid.

858
01:01:31,243 --> 01:01:32,493
Then, what about you?

859
01:01:32,793 --> 01:01:36,403
"My stomach is a little weak,
so I get motion sickness"?

860
01:01:36,403 --> 01:01:37,993
Wasn't that so real?

861
01:01:38,163 --> 01:01:40,953
What do you mean it's real? 
It’s completely ridiculous.

862
01:01:40,953 --> 01:01:42,343
Haejin was better.

863
01:01:43,063 --> 01:01:44,473
Idiot.

864
01:01:45,943 --> 01:01:48,033
Actually, my name is Sanghyun...

865
01:01:48,033 --> 01:01:51,543
Actually I was going to give it to my son
when he was.

866
01:01:52,273 --> 01:01:53,443
Really?

867
01:01:54,333 --> 01:01:55,383
Yeah.

868
01:01:58,443 --> 01:02:00,623
That's not a funny story, huh?

869
01:02:06,953 --> 01:02:08,253
Soyoung...

870
01:02:09,243 --> 01:02:10,123
What?

871
01:02:10,783 --> 01:02:13,543
My real name is Moon So-young.

872
01:02:13,673 --> 01:02:14,793
Then what about Seon-ah...

873
01:02:14,793 --> 01:02:18,473
There's a very annoying
lady who lives next door.

874
01:02:19,943 --> 01:02:22,993
What a bunch of liars, huh?

875
01:02:56,243 --> 01:02:58,123
No, it just happened...

876
01:02:59,793 --> 01:03:01,143
Shall we use it?

877
01:03:02,213 --> 01:03:03,363
Killing a person.

878
01:03:38,693 --> 01:03:39,923
Hello?

879
01:03:42,803 --> 01:03:44,003
Who is it?

880
01:03:46,723 --> 01:03:48,513
Hand over the baby.

881
01:03:49,693 --> 01:03:53,433
You paid all the money to that mother.

882
01:03:53,983 --> 01:03:55,223
5 million won.

883
01:03:57,943 --> 01:04:00,443
You was supposed to erase that
baby on that condition.

884
01:04:01,443 --> 01:04:03,443
Why did you give birth to a baby?

885
01:04:16,773 --> 01:04:20,543
Ms. Moon So-young, I'm a police officer.

886
01:04:20,943 --> 01:04:22,623
Can I talk to you for a minute?

887
01:05:02,443 --> 01:05:03,543
You're here?

888
01:05:03,653 --> 01:05:04,753
You're here?

889
01:05:05,163 --> 01:05:06,473
You took a long time.

890
01:05:06,493 --> 01:05:08,723
We're making a table for three right now.

891
01:05:09,283 --> 01:05:10,483
A share table?

892
01:05:10,533 --> 01:05:12,603
Woosung's share for feeding powdered milk.

893
01:05:14,153 --> 01:05:15,973
Is something good going on?

894
01:05:16,173 --> 01:05:17,193
Yeah.

895
01:05:17,593 --> 01:05:19,433
I have a guest in Seoul.

896
01:05:20,153 --> 01:05:21,773
They're giving me 30 million won.

897
01:05:23,803 --> 01:05:26,653
Oh, that's great.

898
01:05:28,283 --> 01:05:29,773
Are you going to take him a bath now?

899
01:05:29,783 --> 01:05:31,433
Oh, no.

900
01:05:32,133 --> 01:05:36,233
He has poop on his butt and that
hyung is really bad at this.

901
01:05:36,723 --> 01:05:41,043
So, from 6am until 10am.

902
01:05:41,043 --> 01:05:43,003
TTwo-hour shifts, what do you think?

903
01:05:44,333 --> 01:05:47,173
Sang, Dong, So, Dong, Sang...

904
01:05:47,443 --> 01:05:50,673
No, it's a schedule where 
you sleep well for 6 hours.

905
01:05:50,863 --> 01:05:53,843
No, it's not that I sleep well.
Can't I do this?

906
01:05:54,563 --> 01:05:56,843
- That was a bit harsh.
- Oh, right?

907
01:05:56,843 --> 01:05:58,353
- I want to do it.
- What?

908
01:05:58,353 --> 01:05:59,973
- Feeding him milk formula.
- Will you?

909
01:05:59,973 --> 01:06:02,603
- So, from 4am to 6am?
- Yes.

910
01:06:03,743 --> 01:06:07,323
Then, from 10 o'clock
until midnight.

911
01:06:07,373 --> 01:06:09,943
You can't take yours out.

912
01:06:12,583 --> 01:06:14,493
Doesn't she seems easy to cooperate?

913
01:06:16,553 --> 01:06:18,033
Right.

914
01:06:19,683 --> 01:06:22,513
Did the commutation of the
sentence reduction work?

915
01:06:22,513 --> 01:06:25,293
No, I don't think so.

916
01:06:25,703 --> 01:06:27,673
<i>- Give it to me.</i>
- Then what is it?

917
01:06:27,983 --> 01:06:29,433
<i>Hey, then...</i>

918
01:06:29,733 --> 01:06:31,463
Who knows, well, I...

919
01:06:32,233 --> 01:06:35,043
I don't know, but...

920
01:06:35,043 --> 01:06:36,553
<i>You just do everything.</i>

921
01:06:36,683 --> 01:06:39,013
I don't think it's a commutation.

922
01:06:39,143 --> 01:06:40,393
<i>I want to take him a bath, too.</i>

923
01:06:41,283 --> 01:06:43,313
You wash yourself.

924
01:06:43,313 --> 01:06:44,643
Gosh, I hate it.

925
01:06:51,433 --> 01:06:53,943
How is it? Did you feed him?

926
01:06:54,383 --> 01:06:56,323
No, he vomited again.

927
01:06:59,143 --> 01:07:02,083
Are you sure you cooled it down?
Isn't it because it's too hot?

928
01:07:04,483 --> 01:07:05,703
It's fine to me.

929
01:07:06,193 --> 01:07:08,293
Was it because I got wet yesterday?

930
01:07:09,443 --> 01:07:10,883
I'm sorry, Woo Sung-ah.

931
01:07:11,193 --> 01:07:13,383
No, it's not because of you.

932
01:07:13,863 --> 01:07:15,713
No, I don't think it's just a cold...

933
01:07:17,153 --> 01:07:19,443
Have you ever done this before?

934
01:07:22,283 --> 01:07:23,923
We have to take him to the hospital, hyung.

935
01:07:25,863 --> 01:07:29,513
I can't do that.
We might get caught.

936
01:07:43,393 --> 01:07:47,453
It's not like meningitis, right?

937
01:07:48,023 --> 01:07:50,333
Since yesterday, 
he suddenly have a fever like this...

938
01:07:52,233 --> 01:07:54,043
Can he get better?

939
01:07:55,263 --> 01:07:57,093
He's not going die?

940
01:08:00,283 --> 01:08:01,683
Is this your younger brother?

941
01:08:04,123 --> 01:08:05,143
Yes.

942
01:08:05,873 --> 01:08:08,233
He'll be fine, he won't die.

943
01:08:10,113 --> 01:08:11,973
It does seem like a cold,

944
01:08:11,973 --> 01:08:15,153
Please take a good look at it
 so that it doesn't spread to pneumonia.

945
01:08:15,373 --> 01:08:18,403
First, I'll prescribe a fever reducer.

946
01:08:18,413 --> 01:08:21,743
If the fever doesn't go
down, come back tomorrow.

947
01:08:23,583 --> 01:08:25,873
Woosung-ah, good for you.

948
01:08:27,943 --> 01:08:32,463
What's sadder than love

949
01:08:32,463 --> 01:08:35,143
is affection.

950
01:08:35,323 --> 01:08:37,193
Will the baby be okay?

951
01:08:39,633 --> 01:08:41,303
Everyone's making a fuss...

952
01:08:42,163 --> 01:08:44,933
It's just a cold anyway.

953
01:08:45,013 --> 01:08:47,063
Well, whatever it is, but...

954
01:08:48,213 --> 01:08:51,303
If he don't get better soon, that's a trouble.

955
01:08:53,593 --> 01:08:55,193
Are you afraid they won't sell him?

956
01:09:00,433 --> 01:09:04,323
No, if they can't sell him, 
We can't arrest him in the act.

957
01:09:05,863 --> 01:09:07,953
If you're in the department of
 women and adolescents,

958
01:09:08,273 --> 01:09:12,373
I thought we should cast our nets a little
higher up the river than the detectives.

959
01:09:14,903 --> 01:09:16,043
At the top of the river?

960
01:09:17,223 --> 01:09:20,303
Before the baby was abandoned,
Shouldn't you have saved the mother first?

961
01:09:20,303 --> 01:09:22,943
That's the job of the Department of Health.

962
01:09:22,943 --> 01:09:26,183
Before she throw him away, the Department of Health.
After she abandoned him, the policeman.

963
01:09:27,543 --> 01:09:29,353
Gosh, really...

964
01:09:31,403 --> 01:09:33,983
Chief, why are you being
so cold to that woman?

965
01:09:40,873 --> 01:09:42,443
Because she's irresponsible.

966
01:09:44,843 --> 01:09:47,373
Because she give birth to her will 
and throw it away as she wanted.

967
01:09:48,903 --> 01:09:53,123
But she's like that, too.
Being neat...

968
01:09:55,573 --> 01:09:58,463
Do you understand how a mother feels
about abandoning her child?

969
01:10:01,733 --> 01:10:03,173
I can't understand it.

970
01:10:12,433 --> 01:10:15,603
He can't do this.
This isn't a playground.

971
01:10:15,603 --> 01:10:17,903
Right, yes, this is...

972
01:10:18,423 --> 01:10:20,653
- Are you his father?
- Oh, yes...

973
01:10:22,253 --> 01:10:24,033
- Because there are a lot of patients here.
- Yes.

974
01:10:24,033 --> 01:10:25,503
- Be careful.
- Oh, yes.

975
01:10:25,513 --> 01:10:26,903
Are you Woosung's father?

976
01:10:26,903 --> 01:10:27,783
<i>You, really...</i>

977
01:10:27,783 --> 01:10:29,203
Yeah, oh...

978
01:10:30,153 --> 01:10:31,163
Yes.

979
01:10:31,353 --> 01:10:33,083
What is Woosung's resident registration number?

980
01:10:33,093 --> 01:10:34,123
<i>- Okay.</i>
<i>- Yes.</i>

981
01:10:34,123 --> 01:10:36,043
<i>- You can't do that, I'm scolded.</i>
<i>- Yes.</i>

982
01:10:36,123 --> 01:10:37,833
Actually, it's only been 1 month...

983
01:10:37,833 --> 01:10:38,883
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

984
01:10:39,333 --> 01:10:42,143
- One month?
- Everyone was surprised.

985
01:10:43,533 --> 01:10:45,743
Is it because of that powdered milk? 
That...

986
01:10:46,083 --> 01:10:47,593
That American thing, what was it? That...

987
01:10:47,593 --> 01:10:48,843
Similac...

988
01:10:49,793 --> 01:10:51,803
That Similac...

989
01:10:51,813 --> 01:10:53,813
- His grandmother is in the countryside.
- Yes.

990
01:10:53,823 --> 01:10:55,983
- I wonder how many she sent me...
- I know.

991
01:10:56,153 --> 01:10:58,273
She must have been so happy
to have his first grandchild.

992
01:10:59,593 --> 01:11:01,793
Yes, then, 
Woosung's father, go this way...

993
01:11:02,553 --> 01:11:03,813
Oh, yes.

994
01:11:06,563 --> 01:11:09,703
<i>Gosh, that bastard, he
plays soccer all the time...</i>

995
01:11:10,293 --> 01:11:13,903
That's why the owner always squeaks.

996
01:11:13,903 --> 01:11:16,003
Let's get serious.

997
01:11:16,013 --> 01:11:18,363
- Let's go get serious.
- What wrong with him and how...

998
01:11:22,353 --> 01:11:24,053
Thank you for taking care of Woosung.

999
01:11:25,083 --> 01:11:29,133
Well, babies have a fever
and then they grow up.

1000
01:11:30,583 --> 01:11:32,973
If I were alone, 
I wouldn't be able to do anything.

1001
01:11:34,003 --> 01:11:37,483
If you insist, well,
you don't have to do it all by yourself.

1002
01:11:42,193 --> 01:11:44,763
The father...

1003
01:11:45,713 --> 01:11:46,863
of Woosung.

1004
01:11:47,513 --> 01:11:49,203
I was against it from the beginning.

1005
01:11:51,923 --> 01:11:54,453
I see, that's...

1006
01:12:23,923 --> 01:12:27,073
She probably ran away with the baby.

1007
01:12:28,033 --> 01:12:29,573
Find her and bring her back.

1008
01:12:31,223 --> 01:12:32,363
This woman?

1009
01:12:33,213 --> 01:12:34,323
The baby.

1010
01:12:36,553 --> 01:12:38,493
What are you going to do with the baby?

1011
01:12:42,783 --> 01:12:44,083
I'm going to raise him.

1012
01:12:44,823 --> 01:12:45,773
I will.

1013
01:12:46,613 --> 01:12:48,343
Because he's my husband's child.

1014
01:12:58,543 --> 01:13:01,893
It's fully automatic?
Are you kidding me...

1015
01:13:03,143 --> 01:13:05,153
How do you do this?

1016
01:13:17,863 --> 01:13:19,203
Yes, Taeho?

1017
01:13:19,543 --> 01:13:23,123
Oh, I'm sorry but
I'll rush the money.

1018
01:13:27,253 --> 01:13:28,383
What?

1019
01:13:28,933 --> 01:13:31,173
Baby? Who, who?

1020
01:13:35,403 --> 01:13:37,013
Woosung's father?

1021
01:13:38,363 --> 01:13:39,563
How much?

1022
01:13:41,733 --> 01:13:42,973
Four thousand?

1023
01:13:48,333 --> 01:13:50,153
He's totally asleep.

1024
01:13:52,043 --> 01:13:53,463
He must have been tired.

1025
01:13:54,203 --> 01:13:56,823
You've been paying attention to
him for sleeping all day.

1026
01:14:00,573 --> 01:14:02,463
He look like Siwoo, this guy.

1027
01:14:04,623 --> 01:14:07,293
These types don't sell
well and are left behind.

1028
01:14:09,913 --> 01:14:12,593
Didn't you want to be adopted?

1029
01:14:15,473 --> 01:14:17,513
I really liked it there.

1030
01:14:18,113 --> 01:14:20,353
That's why I refused to talk about adoption.

1031
01:14:22,143 --> 01:14:23,983
Because your mom said she'd pick you up?

1032
01:14:27,943 --> 01:14:29,773
What else did hyung talk about?

1033
01:14:31,083 --> 01:14:33,993
Well, about the letter.

1034
01:14:37,423 --> 01:14:40,203
'Cause I never thought
I'd be abandoned

1035
01:14:47,503 --> 01:14:48,923
He fell asleep.

1036
01:14:52,153 --> 01:14:53,343
Do you want to try?

1037
01:14:53,743 --> 01:14:56,053
Please just do me a favor.

1038
01:14:58,423 --> 01:15:00,933
Chin, put his chin on your shoulder.

1039
01:15:01,043 --> 01:15:02,723
I know it, too.

1040
01:15:03,603 --> 01:15:05,933
- No, a little higher.
- I said I know.

1041
01:15:06,863 --> 01:15:09,103
- Hey, you're too weak...
- Gosh, you're loud, a little...

1042
01:15:14,133 --> 01:15:16,403
You're not taking care of
 Woosung on purpose, are you?

1043
01:15:16,863 --> 01:15:18,013
What?

1044
01:15:21,143 --> 01:15:22,953
I'm afraid you won't be able to part later.

1045
01:15:29,363 --> 01:15:30,633
Why are you laughing?

1046
01:15:31,883 --> 01:15:35,213
Then it's perfect to be beaten up by a girl.

1047
01:15:38,413 --> 01:15:40,593
Why are you saying the same thing as hyung?

1048
01:15:57,933 --> 01:15:59,033
Where are you going?

1049
01:15:59,303 --> 01:16:00,363
Convenience store.

1050
01:16:00,613 --> 01:16:01,783
Shall I go instead?

1051
01:16:02,123 --> 01:16:05,883
There are things that 
women can't ask others to do.

1052
01:16:06,823 --> 01:16:09,833
It might rain
Take an umbrella.

1053
01:16:11,003 --> 01:16:12,673
Then come and pick me up if it rains.

1054
01:16:15,223 --> 01:16:16,463
With an umbrella.

1055
01:16:20,773 --> 01:16:21,933
I don't want to.

1056
01:16:23,043 --> 01:16:24,973
I'll be back.

1057
01:16:32,883 --> 01:16:35,023
Where did you meet that mother?

1058
01:16:36,833 --> 01:16:39,613
I was sleeping at Songdo beach
 after running away from home,

1059
01:16:39,883 --> 01:16:41,653
and she told me to come if I was hungry.

1060
01:16:43,863 --> 01:16:46,553
And then you were forced to prostitute yourself?

1061
01:16:51,213 --> 01:16:53,273
Are you looking at me pitifully?

1062
01:16:55,463 --> 01:16:58,883
- No, that's not it...
- I did it even before I met his mom.

1063
01:17:00,173 --> 01:17:03,013
Then why did you kill him?

1064
01:17:04,763 --> 01:17:06,153
It's just because...

1065
01:17:06,953 --> 01:17:08,053
in a fit of rage?

1066
01:17:09,433 --> 01:17:10,643
in a fit of rage?

1067
01:17:11,423 --> 01:17:14,653
Even before I take a shower,
He's telling me to lick it, what a crazy bastard...

1068
01:17:16,313 --> 01:17:19,493
So, the other person first...
I mean, self-defense or...

1069
01:17:19,493 --> 01:17:22,453
If you want to know the list of
 other customers, I can let you know.

1070
01:17:25,183 --> 01:17:28,033
That's enough
All I want to know is...

1071
01:17:28,033 --> 01:17:30,413
Is this an interrogation? Or a sermon?

1072
01:17:30,723 --> 01:17:33,603
As you said, the baby
will be sold, so don't worry.

1073
01:17:35,003 --> 01:17:38,423
I want to help, both me
and my team leader...

1074
01:17:42,523 --> 01:17:44,463
Have you ever abandoned a child?

1075
01:17:44,853 --> 01:17:46,603
Have you ever killed someone?

1076
01:17:47,293 --> 01:17:50,893
Okay, then tell me,
because I don't understand.

1077
01:17:53,743 --> 01:17:57,023
Why did you throw him away?
Outside the church.

1078
01:18:02,633 --> 01:18:03,743
Did you see that?

1079
01:18:08,143 --> 01:18:10,243
If you left him like that, he'd be dead.

1080
01:18:13,523 --> 01:18:15,743
Because I didn't want to see him again.

1081
01:18:17,013 --> 01:18:18,833
Why did you give birth to him 
if you couldn't raise him?

1082
01:18:19,613 --> 01:18:21,133
I should've abort him?

1083
01:18:21,163 --> 01:18:24,373
If you think about the child,
Isn't there an option like that?

1084
01:18:26,563 --> 01:18:29,723
Rather than throwing him away after giving birth,
Killing him before I give birth...

1085
01:18:30,523 --> 01:18:31,973
Is that crime more lighter?

1086
01:18:39,193 --> 01:18:40,273
Well...

1087
01:18:41,263 --> 01:18:44,073
No one wants to be born

1088
01:18:44,633 --> 01:18:46,903
- Isn't the baby more unfortunate?
- I should have killed him before he was born.

1089
01:18:46,903 --> 01:18:48,913
- You talk like that in front of Woosung.
- Stop, stop!

1090
01:18:48,913 --> 01:18:51,243
What do you mean by throwing him away?

1091
01:19:29,233 --> 01:19:30,393
Yes.

1092
01:19:33,603 --> 01:19:35,143
Oh, you know...

1093
01:19:36,503 --> 01:19:40,423
Can you bring me some clothes?
My buttons fell off.

1094
01:19:41,923 --> 01:19:44,753
Yes, in Uljin.

1095
01:19:51,483 --> 01:19:52,663
Isn't it?

1096
01:19:57,253 --> 01:19:59,103
No, that's fine.

1097
01:20:02,803 --> 01:20:05,943
Look at this, look at this, 
listen to this song for a second.

1098
01:20:16,333 --> 01:20:20,003
Hello? Oh, can you hear this? 
Do you remember this?

1099
01:20:20,003 --> 01:20:22,463
In the movie we saw together...

1100
01:20:23,373 --> 01:20:25,003
that comes out...

1101
01:20:29,903 --> 01:20:31,303
Right.

1102
01:20:33,273 --> 01:20:37,353
In reality, well,
That's not gonna happen.

1103
01:20:43,563 --> 01:20:45,693
Rice? What's with rice?

1104
01:20:45,693 --> 01:20:47,403
Oh, like that wedding?

1105
01:20:48,133 --> 01:20:49,403
I see.

1106
01:20:56,963 --> 01:20:59,123
No, I don't think so?

1107
01:21:03,573 --> 01:21:04,713
Sorry.

1108
01:21:13,243 --> 01:21:14,503
It's just.

1109
01:21:26,583 --> 01:21:28,363
Poke it outside.

1110
01:21:29,233 --> 01:21:32,143
Look under the button like this.

1111
01:21:33,333 --> 01:21:36,823
If you spin it a few times,
and you roll it like this,

1112
01:21:37,043 --> 01:21:38,083
It's not coming off well.

1113
01:21:38,263 --> 01:21:39,873
Wow, Dongsoo-hyung,
How do you do that?

1114
01:21:39,873 --> 01:21:41,663
- Hey, Hae-jin, you should try it too.
- I want to do it too.

1115
01:21:42,153 --> 01:21:43,423
Give it a try.

1116
01:21:43,653 --> 01:21:45,253
No, I'm going to do this.

1117
01:21:50,353 --> 01:21:53,343
But what kind of person 
are you going to meet tomorrow?

1118
01:21:53,913 --> 01:21:55,973
Of course, a rich person.

1119
01:21:56,723 --> 01:21:59,313
If you spend that 40 million won like this...

1120
01:21:59,313 --> 01:22:00,513
It's 30 million.

1121
01:22:00,653 --> 01:22:03,823
Ah, right, true, true 
30 million, 30, 30.

1122
01:22:04,603 --> 01:22:07,173
Why? What kind of person do you want?

1123
01:22:08,223 --> 01:22:10,403
Someone as pretty as Soyoung-nuna.

1124
01:22:11,743 --> 01:22:15,113
Hey, Dongsu. Learn something, learn.

1125
01:22:15,723 --> 01:22:18,873
You shouldn't let a man
 say such empty words, man.

1126
01:22:18,873 --> 01:22:21,663
Oh my, I've learned a few things, Master.

1127
01:22:21,693 --> 01:22:22,823
<i>What?</i>

1128
01:22:23,243 --> 01:22:24,713
<i>I couldn't hear you well.</i>

1129
01:22:25,443 --> 01:22:29,323
In the old days, it was said that the eldest son resembles
the mother and the eldest daughter resembles the father.

1130
01:22:29,323 --> 01:22:31,253
And so our house is ruined.

1131
01:22:32,143 --> 01:22:34,263
It's okay, we don't live together.

1132
01:22:34,763 --> 01:22:36,833
All of that is superstition.

1133
01:22:37,033 --> 01:22:40,263
Oh, she's the eldest, eldest.

1134
01:22:40,263 --> 01:22:41,103
You're noisy.

1135
01:22:41,103 --> 01:22:44,483
Whenever I look at my 
mom's pictures, I'm surprised

1136
01:22:44,483 --> 01:22:45,713
I thought it was me.

1137
01:22:48,463 --> 01:22:50,483
The button was about to fall off.

1138
01:22:50,483 --> 01:22:52,323
Here you go.

1139
01:22:57,523 --> 01:22:58,643
Where are you going?

1140
01:22:58,693 --> 01:23:00,043
To wash up.

1141
01:23:05,813 --> 01:23:07,293
That guy, too

1142
01:23:08,773 --> 01:23:10,403
He don't know his parents' faces, really...

1143
01:23:12,193 --> 01:23:13,823
Living without knowing...

1144
01:23:15,153 --> 01:23:17,303
There are cases like that.

1145
01:23:24,313 --> 01:23:28,563
It'd would be better if 
Woosung doesn't know my face.

1146
01:23:31,403 --> 01:23:32,713
Why did you think so?

1147
01:23:36,513 --> 01:23:37,823
Because I'm a murderer.

1148
01:23:40,103 --> 01:23:41,293
Murderer?

1149
01:23:42,563 --> 01:23:43,583
Yes.

1150
01:23:46,153 --> 01:23:47,453
You killed who?

1151
01:23:50,193 --> 01:23:51,543
Woo-sung's father.

1152
01:23:56,563 --> 01:23:57,633
Why?

1153
01:24:06,043 --> 01:24:08,683
He shouldn't have been born like this.

1154
01:24:10,393 --> 01:24:11,993
I was going to take Woosung away.

1155
01:24:16,483 --> 01:24:17,443
What?

1156
01:24:20,523 --> 01:24:23,623
His wife is probably after me by now.

1157
01:24:28,523 --> 01:24:32,673
So if you're going to sell him properly, 
you can leave me behind.

1158
01:24:42,833 --> 01:24:44,723
Oh, I'm out of the motel right now.

1159
01:24:45,903 --> 01:24:47,853
Oh, and now, wait a minute.

1160
01:24:48,063 --> 01:24:49,743
Oh, wait.

1161
01:24:52,083 --> 01:24:54,003
Let me ask you something.

1162
01:24:54,383 --> 01:24:55,483
Hyung!

1163
01:24:59,253 --> 01:25:00,493
What are you doing here?

1164
01:25:01,163 --> 01:25:05,373
No, what Soyoung said yesterday 
was on my mind, so I looked here.

1165
01:25:06,613 --> 01:25:07,743
This...

1166
01:25:07,853 --> 01:25:09,043
What is this?

1167
01:25:10,853 --> 01:25:14,003
Is this a GPS or something,
where did you find this?

1168
01:25:14,303 --> 01:25:15,673
Here.

1169
01:25:18,763 --> 01:25:19,693
A police?

1170
01:25:20,563 --> 01:25:23,623
The police don't use old items 
like this these days.

1171
01:25:24,813 --> 01:25:27,973
So you're saying
they've been following us.

1172
01:25:28,413 --> 01:25:29,683
Don't you think so?

1173
01:25:29,863 --> 01:25:32,293
That Woosung's paternal side.

1174
01:25:36,963 --> 01:25:38,193
I can't.

1175
01:25:38,193 --> 01:25:39,113
What?

1176
01:25:39,803 --> 01:25:42,493
Hyung, you're thinking of
leaving Soyoung here now.

1177
01:25:43,533 --> 01:25:44,973
That...

1178
01:25:47,953 --> 01:25:51,903
This time, It's not money but 
something Soyoung can understand.

1179
01:25:53,003 --> 01:25:55,083
Let's find such a buyer together.

1180
01:25:56,303 --> 01:26:00,093
Hey dude, no matter what,
money isn't everything

1181
01:26:01,153 --> 01:26:02,423
Then, that's good to hear.

1182
01:26:04,173 --> 01:26:05,803
Then I'll take care of this myself.

1183
01:26:09,293 --> 01:26:10,393
What?

1184
01:26:11,973 --> 01:26:13,353
what are you doing now?

1185
01:26:38,473 --> 01:26:40,253
I know everything though.

1186
01:26:40,693 --> 01:26:43,343
Woosung's father is dead.

1187
01:26:44,433 --> 01:26:47,363
So what? 
You just need to get paid.

1188
01:26:50,033 --> 01:26:53,353
I mean, who the hell is
trying to save Woosung?

1189
01:26:56,833 --> 01:26:58,133
A dead man's wife.

1190
01:26:59,003 --> 01:27:00,363
What is she going to do after buying him?

1191
01:27:02,233 --> 01:27:03,873
She wanted to raise him.

1192
01:27:03,873 --> 01:27:06,653
She's going to raise him?
Let's not talk nonsense.

1193
01:27:06,783 --> 01:27:08,613
You're trying to sell him out, aren't you?

1194
01:27:09,113 --> 01:27:12,063
To that foreign country, overseas, huh?
I will never sell him.

1195
01:27:13,393 --> 01:27:15,273
Get out, Mister. Get out!

1196
01:27:15,683 --> 01:27:17,063
Hey, hey!

1197
01:27:18,813 --> 01:27:20,083
Who are you?

1198
01:27:21,193 --> 01:27:22,423
I see.

1199
01:27:23,493 --> 01:27:25,083
Are you on Woosung's father side?

1200
01:27:25,203 --> 01:27:28,093
Shut up, give the kid to me.
Hey, you're not coming out? Get out! Get out!

1201
01:27:39,373 --> 01:27:41,553
Hey, hey, hey!

1202
01:27:43,963 --> 01:27:46,193
Hey, aren't he dead?

1203
01:27:47,693 --> 01:27:50,213
Hey, it's the son of my acquiantance, man!

1204
01:27:50,773 --> 01:27:52,573
It's okay. He just passed out.

1205
01:27:58,003 --> 01:27:59,103
Let's do it together.

1206
01:28:18,023 --> 01:28:19,663
Where are you going now?

1207
01:28:19,893 --> 01:28:22,953
Oh, that's along this road.
We're heading south.

1208
01:28:22,953 --> 01:28:25,143
I think I can catch up
with it in about 5km.

1209
01:28:25,393 --> 01:28:27,183
- Speed ​​it up.
- Yeah.

1210
01:28:27,233 --> 01:28:28,323
I let my guard down.

1211
01:29:13,753 --> 01:29:14,783
Yeah.

1212
01:29:16,533 --> 01:29:17,873
I had a dream.

1213
01:29:20,053 --> 01:29:22,753
Once upon a time, with my daughter

1214
01:29:23,573 --> 01:29:27,423
I rode this together with my wife
and mom and went to Wolmi.

1215
01:29:28,993 --> 01:29:30,303
Then that...

1216
01:29:30,303 --> 01:29:31,553
What a nice dream.

1217
01:29:31,993 --> 01:29:34,343
No, not really.

1218
01:29:40,943 --> 01:29:44,063
Why do you think she taught it on purpose?

1219
01:29:44,963 --> 01:29:46,883
- The destination?
- Yes.

1220
01:29:50,733 --> 01:29:52,903
I guess she wants me to follow her.

1221
01:29:53,873 --> 01:29:57,573
You mean not to lose Woosung?

1222
01:30:00,563 --> 01:30:02,503
That's what she thinks.

1223
01:30:17,613 --> 01:30:18,933
Are you gonna be okay?

1224
01:30:19,583 --> 01:30:20,973
It's on me.

1225
01:30:22,423 --> 01:30:23,553
It's not that.

1226
01:30:27,173 --> 01:30:29,483
I'm just going to go by myself if I have to.

1227
01:30:31,723 --> 01:30:33,243
Even so, that's fine.

1228
01:30:34,153 --> 01:30:35,953
As long as it's not like installments 
or anything like that.

1229
01:30:38,233 --> 01:30:39,933
- Soyoung-ah 
- Yes?

1230
01:30:41,893 --> 01:30:45,663
Do you perhaps...
You know, you put Woosung in the box.

1231
01:30:47,773 --> 01:30:52,503
I mean, were you really going 
to pick him up again?

1232
01:30:59,633 --> 01:31:00,853
No?

1233
01:31:03,183 --> 01:31:04,603
I don't know.

1234
01:31:08,253 --> 01:31:09,603
But...

1235
01:31:11,793 --> 01:31:14,483
If we had met a little earlier,

1236
01:31:17,273 --> 01:31:19,393
I wouldn't have to throw him away...

1237
01:31:23,713 --> 01:31:25,323
It's not too late.

1238
01:31:26,933 --> 01:31:28,623
Oh? What did you say?

1239
01:31:30,493 --> 01:31:31,753
Oh, nothing.

1240
01:31:36,953 --> 01:31:40,443
Mister Sanghyun is the only one who
 has Soyoung. You're too mean.

1241
01:31:41,233 --> 01:31:43,723
Is that so? Well then, touch the baton.

1242
01:31:49,913 --> 01:31:51,893
What kind of man do you like nuna?

1243
01:31:52,713 --> 01:31:53,733
What?

1244
01:31:56,933 --> 01:31:58,153
I'm not sure.

1245
01:31:59,163 --> 01:32:01,793
A man who looks good
with suspenders like Haejin?

1246
01:32:05,653 --> 01:32:08,833
Haejin... that's such a good name.

1247
01:32:09,823 --> 01:32:11,423
I like your name.

1248
01:32:12,083 --> 01:32:14,093
That means heading to the sea, right?

1249
01:32:15,263 --> 01:32:19,323
When you become an adult,
I'm sure you'll be working abroad.

1250
01:32:20,153 --> 01:32:22,103
In the Premier League?

1251
01:32:23,933 --> 01:32:24,973
Yeah.

1252
01:32:27,753 --> 01:32:29,853
Who named Woosung?

1253
01:32:30,383 --> 01:32:31,593
Me.

1254
01:32:31,663 --> 01:32:32,983
I envy him.

1255
01:32:33,783 --> 01:32:36,113
What does Woosung mean?

1256
01:32:41,763 --> 01:32:43,953
Woo means wings

1257
01:32:44,193 --> 01:32:45,473
Sung means star.

1258
01:32:46,183 --> 01:32:48,633
It means I want him to go far away.

1259
01:32:49,083 --> 01:32:52,213
If Haejin is heading to the sea,
then Woosung is over there.

1260
01:32:52,413 --> 01:32:55,003
Beyond the sky to the stars like this?

1261
01:32:55,503 --> 01:32:57,003
Like an astronaut?

1262
01:32:57,863 --> 01:32:59,113
Or maybe a pilot?

1263
01:33:00,823 --> 01:33:02,343
You two look like siblings.

1264
01:33:29,153 --> 01:33:30,343
Oh yes, hello?

1265
01:33:30,403 --> 01:33:33,853
Well, I'd like to have an hour or
 two of your appointment.

1266
01:33:34,123 --> 01:33:36,583
I'll see you at 12, yeah, yeah.

1267
01:33:36,583 --> 01:33:38,003
I got it, yes.

1268
01:33:46,153 --> 01:33:48,183
Today's star is Woosung.

1269
01:33:49,183 --> 01:33:50,393
Understand?

1270
01:33:50,643 --> 01:33:54,003
- If you adopt me too...
- No, never.

1271
01:34:06,973 --> 01:34:11,383
Ah, like this, we thank you 
so much for doing us a favor.

1272
01:34:12,603 --> 01:34:15,003
I've already told you this but,

1273
01:34:17,163 --> 01:34:20,463
My wife had a stillbirth...

1274
01:34:21,193 --> 01:34:23,513
I don't want to think about the next time...

1275
01:34:23,513 --> 01:34:26,633
Yes, it must have been very difficult.

1276
01:34:27,893 --> 01:34:29,643
It's a girl.

1277
01:34:30,673 --> 01:34:33,433
She was a cute baby that looked like him...

1278
01:34:34,503 --> 01:34:37,023
Oh, let's sit down and
have some coffee...

1279
01:34:37,063 --> 01:34:38,613
Oh, how about ice coffee?

1280
01:34:39,713 --> 01:34:40,653
Sure.

1281
01:34:42,403 --> 01:34:46,533
Can I give him a hug?

1282
01:34:46,533 --> 01:34:48,033
Oh of course, yes.

1283
01:34:48,033 --> 01:34:49,323
Excuse me...

1284
01:34:50,373 --> 01:34:52,913
Yes, iced coffee.

1285
01:34:52,913 --> 01:34:54,623
- One, two, three...
- Woo Sung-ah.

1286
01:34:59,893 --> 01:35:01,543
It's okay, I'm not scary.

1287
01:35:01,683 --> 01:35:03,003
Is it because he's hungry?

1288
01:35:03,023 --> 01:35:05,113
- Get some formula.
- Are you hungry?

1289
01:35:05,193 --> 01:35:08,623
- Oh, yes.
- If you're okay with that...

1290
01:35:08,623 --> 01:35:11,393
Do you mind if I try to breastfeed him?

1291
01:35:12,503 --> 01:35:14,103
- Is that fine, right?
- Yes.

1292
01:35:14,403 --> 01:35:17,143
Yeah, then, I... there, yeah

1293
01:35:17,143 --> 01:35:19,943
- Thank you.
- Yes, thank you.

1294
01:35:21,733 --> 01:35:22,943
Woo Sung-ah.

1295
01:35:23,883 --> 01:35:27,323
It's okay, it's okay.

1296
01:35:29,263 --> 01:35:30,703
Oh, how...

1297
01:35:34,643 --> 01:35:36,703
Drink it, drink, yeah 
yeah, drink it.

1298
01:35:38,733 --> 01:35:40,083
Oh my, good.

1299
01:35:41,323 --> 01:35:43,043
Oh my, it's delicious.

1300
01:35:49,103 --> 01:35:52,013
I didn't write in the email though

1301
01:35:52,623 --> 01:35:54,413
Can I suggest something?

1302
01:35:55,673 --> 01:35:57,443
Thinking about the future...

1303
01:35:58,383 --> 01:36:01,153
I want to raise Woosung as my own child.

1304
01:36:02,303 --> 01:36:05,703
So, with this as the last thing,

1305
01:36:06,573 --> 01:36:09,953
I don't want him to meet his biological mom.

1306
01:36:11,183 --> 01:36:12,703
It will be hard

1307
01:36:12,973 --> 01:36:16,293
but hink about it slowly today.

1308
01:36:29,323 --> 01:36:31,633
Nuna, nuna, here,
here, here, here.

1309
01:36:43,633 --> 01:36:45,113
Wow, it came out good.

1310
01:36:45,113 --> 01:36:46,513
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

1311
01:36:54,443 --> 01:36:57,833
It's a monorail, bye!

1312
01:36:58,923 --> 01:37:00,353
Bye!

1313
01:37:06,853 --> 01:37:10,423
Let's take a picture here! Let's
take a picture, let's take a picture!

1314
01:37:10,873 --> 01:37:12,133
Come on in, quickly.

1315
01:37:13,963 --> 01:37:15,263
Do you have money?

1316
01:37:17,473 --> 01:37:18,603
4,000 won.

1317
01:37:24,583 --> 01:37:26,153
What prize do you want?

1318
01:37:26,153 --> 01:37:28,023
No, not yet. Not yet.
I haven't done it yet.

1319
01:37:28,023 --> 01:37:28,973
Wait, wait.

1320
01:37:28,973 --> 01:37:30,493
A monkey doll, a monkey doll!

1321
01:37:30,493 --> 01:37:31,613
- Monkey doll!
- I'm in trouble.

1322
01:37:32,283 --> 01:37:34,573
I can't get it wrong, can I?

1323
01:37:36,473 --> 01:37:37,083
Wait, wait.

1324
01:37:37,083 --> 01:37:38,533
- I'll try it one more time.
- Come on! Go! Go! Go!

1325
01:37:38,533 --> 01:37:39,703
I want to do it too.

1326
01:37:44,543 --> 01:37:47,873
Haejin-ah, there's a soccer field
Look.

1327
01:37:47,883 --> 01:37:49,133
- Yes.
- What?

1328
01:37:49,643 --> 01:37:51,623
- There's a socced field over there.
- Yes.

1329
01:37:52,903 --> 01:37:56,803
I'm afraid right now
because I'm scared of heights.

1330
01:37:57,103 --> 01:38:00,683
Hey, kid. I mean, you
said you wanted to ride this.

1331
01:38:01,343 --> 01:38:02,903
Back then, it was just...

1332
01:38:02,903 --> 01:38:05,613
Hey, what's wrong with your face?

1333
01:38:05,843 --> 01:38:07,733
Hey, aren't you vomiting?

1334
01:38:07,733 --> 01:38:10,443
Why are you so blue?
Are you okay?

1335
01:38:10,963 --> 01:38:12,893
- Hey, you can't vomit.
- Yes.

1336
01:38:12,943 --> 01:38:13,993
- Got it?
- Yes.

1337
01:38:14,713 --> 01:38:16,573
- You can't vomit here.
- Yeah.

1338
01:38:17,043 --> 01:38:20,873
Gosh, this kid, really. I wanted
 to be nice to you, but...

1339
01:38:21,193 --> 01:38:22,953
Take me there, please.

1340
01:38:23,103 --> 01:38:24,973
- To where?
- New car...

1341
01:38:24,983 --> 01:38:26,963
- What?
- New car...

1342
01:38:26,963 --> 01:38:28,803
- A new conductor? New car?
- Yes.

1343
01:38:29,363 --> 01:38:31,553
You mean, with that water on top.
You like that?

1344
01:38:31,553 --> 01:38:32,513
Yes.

1345
01:38:34,093 --> 01:38:38,223
Yeah, let's go again when
things go well tomorrow.

1346
01:38:38,863 --> 01:38:40,183
- When we have arrived...
- Yes.

1347
01:38:40,183 --> 01:38:41,143
Let me know.

1348
01:38:41,143 --> 01:38:42,813
Sure.

1349
01:38:43,293 --> 01:38:45,143
- Don't vomit.
- Yeah.

1350
01:38:45,293 --> 01:38:47,303
This kid, really...

1351
01:39:03,883 --> 01:39:05,543
Should we look for more?

1352
01:39:10,923 --> 01:39:14,443
Or you can quit. 
You can send him for adoption.

1353
01:39:18,573 --> 01:39:19,833
But still...

1354
01:39:22,463 --> 01:39:23,773
Then...

1355
01:39:24,793 --> 01:39:26,483
We can raise him.

1356
01:39:30,443 --> 01:39:31,583
We?

1357
01:39:33,563 --> 01:39:34,693
The four of us...

1358
01:39:36,713 --> 01:39:39,913
Five of us, including Haejin, sounds good.

1359
01:39:43,153 --> 01:39:46,953
What a weird family. 
Whose father is whose dad?

1360
01:39:53,243 --> 01:39:54,973
Of couse, I'm Woosung's dad.

1361
01:40:00,033 --> 01:40:02,763
But that's what people 
usually say when they propose?

1362
01:40:04,993 --> 01:40:06,113
Is that so?

1363
01:40:17,613 --> 01:40:20,643
I wish I could
start over like that.

1364
01:40:34,823 --> 01:40:36,383
But it won't work.

1365
01:40:39,163 --> 01:40:41,263
I'll be arrested soon.

1366
01:40:48,073 --> 01:40:50,853
Moon Mo, a prostitute from Busan

1367
01:40:50,893 --> 01:40:53,283
She killed a man and ran away.

1368
01:40:54,413 --> 01:40:57,573
When the baby gets in the way,
 she dumps it in the baby box.

1369
01:41:10,403 --> 01:41:11,963
Does it come out like this?

1370
01:41:15,933 --> 01:41:18,343
They don't blur face these days.

1371
01:41:21,143 --> 01:41:22,393
Is that so?

1372
01:41:29,083 --> 01:41:31,063
It shook a bit, right?

1373
01:41:33,673 --> 01:41:36,813
It's okay, it's because we're at the top.

1374
01:41:40,223 --> 01:41:42,783
I'm scared because
I can't see anything

1375
01:41:44,203 --> 01:41:45,413
Strangely...

1376
01:42:01,233 --> 01:42:04,133
Seeing you makes my
heart feel a little more at ease.

1377
01:42:06,563 --> 01:42:07,683
Why is that?

1378
01:42:09,203 --> 01:42:10,523
My mother also...

1379
01:42:13,043 --> 01:42:16,273
She had no choice. I think that there
must be a reason why she had to abandon me.

1380
01:42:26,893 --> 01:42:28,203
Still...

1381
01:42:30,983 --> 01:42:33,373
You don't have to forgive her.

1382
01:42:35,523 --> 01:42:38,673
Because it doesn't change the
fact that she's a bad mother.

1383
01:42:47,533 --> 01:42:48,673
That's why

1384
01:42:51,403 --> 01:42:53,353
Instead, I will forgive Soyoung.

1385
01:43:07,603 --> 01:43:10,073
Woosung will never forgive me.

1386
01:43:15,963 --> 01:43:17,393
The reason I threw Woosung away

1387
01:43:19,253 --> 01:43:22,093
It's because I don't want to
make Woosung as the murderer's child.

1388
01:43:29,573 --> 01:43:30,883
But still

1389
01:43:34,313 --> 01:43:36,293
The fact that I abandoned him  is just the same.

1390
01:43:57,403 --> 01:44:00,543
I guess I was the one who
wanted to sell him the most.

1391
01:44:05,203 --> 01:44:07,303
We're more like brokers.

1392
01:44:28,083 --> 01:44:31,033
Was it when you were young?

1393
01:44:31,033 --> 01:44:32,533
Back then I took you into my arms...

1394
01:44:33,133 --> 01:44:35,033
You almost threw up, but...

1395
01:44:35,263 --> 01:44:38,203
You didn't throw up. 
You was in my stomach.

1396
01:44:38,993 --> 01:44:42,883
I don't remember, I
was three years old back then.

1397
01:44:44,963 --> 01:44:46,683
Has it been that long?

1398
01:44:49,283 --> 01:44:53,143
Hey, how can you solve such a
 difficult problem already like this?

1399
01:44:59,053 --> 01:45:01,643
Why? Who is it?

1400
01:45:02,053 --> 01:45:03,233
Mom.

1401
01:45:03,673 --> 01:45:04,903
Why? Answer her.

1402
01:45:05,463 --> 01:45:07,563
Oh? Is it a text?

1403
01:45:07,733 --> 01:45:09,193
Then reply her back.

1404
01:45:09,633 --> 01:45:11,613
Should we take a selfie and 
send it to your mom?

1405
01:45:11,853 --> 01:45:12,663
It's fine.

1406
01:45:12,663 --> 01:45:15,283
Here's your order,
Enjoy your meal.

1407
01:45:17,183 --> 01:45:19,163
Eat it. It looks delicious.

1408
01:45:22,093 --> 01:45:26,423
Dad will have a lot of money 
coming in tomorrow.

1409
01:45:27,423 --> 01:45:31,223
Then like in the past, with mom and I

1410
01:45:31,303 --> 01:45:33,393
The three of us in Busan

1411
01:45:34,503 --> 01:45:37,053
Oh, Daddy can come to Seoul...

1412
01:45:38,703 --> 01:45:43,463
Now that you have money,
please don't contact me again.

1413
01:45:45,013 --> 01:45:47,413
That's what mom said.

1414
01:45:50,163 --> 01:45:51,413
Mom...

1415
01:45:54,733 --> 01:45:58,413
But she told me you don't 
ever come back home again.

1416
01:46:02,463 --> 01:46:05,883
Last time, daddy was so drunk.

1417
01:46:06,153 --> 01:46:09,343
Oh, this straw is...

1418
01:46:09,973 --> 01:46:11,673
a heart, it's shaped like a heart.

1419
01:46:14,723 --> 01:46:16,053
You know...

1420
01:46:17,463 --> 01:46:19,643
Mom's baby will be born.

1421
01:46:22,653 --> 01:46:23,813
Mom?

1422
01:46:25,043 --> 01:46:27,813
Yes, it's a boy.

1423
01:46:32,973 --> 01:46:34,493
Oh, I see.

1424
01:46:37,963 --> 01:46:41,203
Well, then 
tell your mom congratulations...

1425
01:46:43,213 --> 01:46:44,543
Sorry.

1426
01:46:46,183 --> 01:46:47,653
Oh, it's nothing.

1427
01:46:50,573 --> 01:46:55,723
But still, I'll continue to be Yoona's dad.

1428
01:46:56,433 --> 01:46:57,233
Right?

1429
01:46:59,643 --> 01:47:00,753
Really?

1430
01:47:06,533 --> 01:47:07,603
Of course.

1431
01:47:10,803 --> 01:47:12,233
I'll go now.

1432
01:47:15,913 --> 01:47:17,103
See you again.

1433
01:48:02,623 --> 01:48:05,793
Steak, steak...

1434
01:48:05,793 --> 01:48:07,373
Should I try it?

1435
01:48:08,173 --> 01:48:11,503
Anyway, I wish you 
success tomorrow..

1436
01:48:11,503 --> 01:48:12,303
Here.

1437
01:48:13,303 --> 01:48:14,553
Here...

1438
01:48:22,413 --> 01:48:24,853
Woo Sung-ah, say "Hae-jin hyung".

1439
01:48:24,853 --> 01:48:26,723
Hae-jin hyung, Hae-jin hyung.

1440
01:48:28,433 --> 01:48:30,063
Oh! Haejin said it!

1441
01:48:30,993 --> 01:48:32,343
You must have done that.

1442
01:48:33,333 --> 01:48:36,823
- Woo Sung-ah, did you? Right?
- That's right, I did.

1443
01:48:37,593 --> 01:48:41,033
Woosung, we must never forget it.

1444
01:48:41,663 --> 01:48:43,133
He'll forget it soon.

1445
01:48:44,293 --> 01:48:48,303
Haejin did Woosung's part
You just have to remember everything.

1446
01:48:49,713 --> 01:48:53,663
Gosh, this kid, no matter how you look at,
He's really unfortunate.

1447
01:48:53,673 --> 01:48:55,213
I totally agree.

1448
01:48:57,343 --> 01:49:00,183
Woosung, I had so much fun today.

1449
01:49:00,813 --> 01:49:03,843
So let's not forget it in future.

1450
01:49:05,303 --> 01:49:09,023
You doesn't talk to Woosung.

1451
01:49:10,983 --> 01:49:12,283
No, it's not?

1452
01:49:12,663 --> 01:49:15,613
No, I've never seen it.

1453
01:49:18,523 --> 01:49:20,243
Today's the last day. 
Say something to him.

1454
01:49:22,363 --> 01:49:23,953
What do you want me to say?

1455
01:49:25,833 --> 01:49:27,673
Well, anything.

1456
01:49:29,573 --> 01:49:32,293
Well, "Thank you for being born", like that.

1457
01:49:33,203 --> 01:49:35,043
You know, that kind of words, why?

1458
01:49:37,133 --> 01:49:39,023
He don't even understand anything.

1459
01:49:39,023 --> 01:49:40,513
Even if he don't understand...

1460
01:49:41,683 --> 01:49:44,843
Since Woosung was born,
He want to hear that at least once.

1461
01:49:55,713 --> 01:49:59,983
Nuna, then tell us everything here.

1462
01:50:00,843 --> 01:50:02,403
- Everyhing?
- Yes.

1463
01:50:03,243 --> 01:50:05,493
- All of these here?
- Yes!

1464
01:50:06,293 --> 01:50:07,993
That stupid kid.

1465
01:50:08,523 --> 01:50:09,663
I'll pass.

1466
01:50:10,603 --> 01:50:11,503
What?

1467
01:50:11,503 --> 01:50:13,293
If she talked first to him...

1468
01:50:15,553 --> 01:50:17,503
Then I'll pass, too.

1469
01:50:25,723 --> 01:50:27,683
Okay, I'll talk to him.

1470
01:50:30,753 --> 01:50:32,523
Everyone close your eyes, then.

1471
01:50:34,133 --> 01:50:35,563
Come on, wait, wait!

1472
01:50:37,653 --> 01:50:38,903
Let's turn off the lights.

1473
01:50:40,193 --> 01:50:42,573
What, hey!

1474
01:50:42,623 --> 01:50:44,833
If you turn off the lights,
How can I eat my steak...

1475
01:50:44,973 --> 01:50:47,493
Hey! Don't turn off the lights.

1476
01:50:48,493 --> 01:50:50,283
Don't turn off the lights...

1477
01:50:54,073 --> 01:50:56,303
Then, I'll start.

1478
01:51:01,363 --> 01:51:05,883
Haejin-ah, thank you for being born.

1479
01:51:10,503 --> 01:51:11,813
Sang Hyun-ah.

1480
01:51:14,793 --> 01:51:16,733
Thank you for being born.

1481
01:51:19,813 --> 01:51:21,193
Dongsu.

1482
01:51:24,503 --> 01:51:26,323
Thank you for being born.

1483
01:51:31,433 --> 01:51:32,703
Woo Sung-ah

1484
01:51:36,363 --> 01:51:38,193
Thank you...

1485
01:51:41,113 --> 01:51:42,293
...for being born.

1486
01:51:45,333 --> 01:51:46,593
So Young-ah

1487
01:51:51,183 --> 01:51:53,683
Soyoung, thank you for being born, too.

1488
01:52:05,843 --> 01:52:08,783
Then, everyone, sleep well.

1489
01:52:10,253 --> 01:52:11,453
Good night.

1490
01:52:51,813 --> 01:52:53,703
I'll make a suggestion.

1491
01:52:59,743 --> 01:53:01,923
Let's say you turn yourself in here.

1492
01:53:03,883 --> 01:53:04,843
What?

1493
01:53:05,503 --> 01:53:08,843
Woosung, well...
You don't have to go sell him anymore.

1494
01:53:10,143 --> 01:53:12,553
What, you said to sold him 
and now not to sell him?

1495
01:53:13,433 --> 01:53:15,393
If you turn yourself in and go into injury,

1496
01:53:15,393 --> 01:53:18,643
If things go well, you'll be on parole 
for the first time in three years.

1497
01:53:20,463 --> 01:53:23,943
Then you can live together 
with Woosung again someday.

1498
01:53:27,683 --> 01:53:29,243
Those two people,

1499
01:53:29,813 --> 01:53:32,473
Unfortunately, they can't be parents.

1500
01:53:34,833 --> 01:53:36,223
So do I.

1501
01:53:38,693 --> 01:53:40,873
The couple I met today was like that.

1502
01:53:43,583 --> 01:53:46,503
Woosung is not an abandoned
child, but a protected child.

1503
01:53:48,013 --> 01:53:50,443
They'll tell them like that, every day.
They're going to raise him.

1504
01:53:53,613 --> 01:53:56,683
I hope Woosung grows up 
under such people

1505
01:54:01,083 --> 01:54:02,303
Then...

1506
01:54:08,643 --> 01:54:09,953
...then

1507
01:54:12,653 --> 01:54:14,813
He don't have to live like me.

1508
01:54:37,563 --> 01:54:38,673
Where are you going?

1509
01:54:43,083 --> 01:54:44,433
Soyoung isn't here either.

1510
01:54:45,343 --> 01:54:49,443
Soyoung is outside right now
She's probably meeting with the detectives.

1511
01:54:51,683 --> 01:54:53,943
Soyoung is not the type to turn us out.

1512
01:54:54,103 --> 01:54:56,493
No, it can happen.

1513
01:54:57,433 --> 01:55:00,333
If it's for Woosung,
She'll do anything.

1514
01:55:02,343 --> 01:55:03,483
But,

1515
01:55:04,873 --> 01:55:06,253
She can do that.

1516
01:55:11,583 --> 01:55:15,803
You too, dude.
You'll find out when you become a parent.

1517
01:55:19,963 --> 01:55:21,563
If she sell us out,

1518
01:55:23,953 --> 01:55:26,443
Will Soyoung be able to start over?

1519
01:55:28,383 --> 01:55:29,403
Of course.

1520
01:55:30,503 --> 01:55:31,773
No matter what

1521
01:55:33,283 --> 01:55:34,643
with Woosung.

1522
01:55:54,433 --> 01:55:56,553
If you go first,
I’ll catch up with you in a minute.

1523
01:56:00,263 --> 01:56:02,223
Hey, come here.

1524
01:56:02,503 --> 01:56:04,223
- Hey, Taeho.
- Why don't you come?

1525
01:56:04,223 --> 01:56:05,503
- I need to talk to you.
- Come here.

1526
01:56:05,503 --> 01:56:06,793
- Wait.
- Let go.

1527
01:56:06,793 --> 01:56:08,893
You haven't given up yet?
Hey, wait.

1528
01:56:09,103 --> 01:56:10,873
Of course, so don't ask.

1529
01:56:12,383 --> 01:56:14,573
Hey, think about it too.

1530
01:56:14,853 --> 01:56:18,463
If that woman raises the kid,
I don't think he's going to grow.

1531
01:56:18,463 --> 01:56:20,743
Would you be happy? Huh?

1532
01:56:20,983 --> 01:56:23,143
Why are you pretending to be
nice? That's a bullshit.

1533
01:56:23,383 --> 01:56:25,993
You're just a broker.
Seriously, come on, won't you let me go?

1534
01:56:26,903 --> 01:56:29,353
- Oh, really.
- I need to talk to you.

1535
01:56:29,743 --> 01:56:31,043
Hey, don't do that.

1536
01:56:34,263 --> 01:56:37,263
With that 40 million won,
Let's do business together.

1537
01:56:40,343 --> 01:56:43,413
You're talking nonsense.
Why should I do it with you?

1538
01:56:46,503 --> 01:56:48,383
I don't work with Dongsu, anymore.

1539
01:56:52,463 --> 01:56:53,483
What?

1540
01:56:55,183 --> 01:56:57,073
I don't know what to do with them.

1541
01:57:00,253 --> 01:57:02,913
I don't need them anymore...

1542
01:57:10,063 --> 01:57:13,253
She scolded me a lot 
for saying that yesterday.

1543
01:57:14,083 --> 01:57:16,263
You suddenly brought that up.

1544
01:57:16,963 --> 01:57:18,573
We're being rude to her mother.

1545
01:57:19,453 --> 01:57:21,273
So, oh...

1546
01:57:21,383 --> 01:57:24,093
If you want to meet him,
call me anytime.

1547
01:57:24,093 --> 01:57:26,093
Please tell her mother, please.

1548
01:57:27,663 --> 01:57:31,273
I don't want to hide anything from him.

1549
01:57:34,043 --> 01:57:36,023
If you're someone like that,

1550
01:57:37,853 --> 01:57:39,413
Even if I send Woosung away,

1551
01:57:41,233 --> 01:57:43,493
I think it would have been okay.

1552
01:57:47,853 --> 01:57:49,703
Oh? Who is it?

1553
01:57:50,753 --> 01:57:52,123
It must be Sang-hyun.

1554
01:57:55,003 --> 01:57:57,423
Yes, who are you?

1555
01:57:59,443 --> 01:58:00,753
This is the police.

1556
01:58:01,763 --> 01:58:03,343
No, this, what is the meaning this?

1557
01:58:03,343 --> 01:58:06,093
On suspicion of illegal child trafficking,
I need you to go to the station with me.

1558
01:58:06,293 --> 01:58:06,973
Honey.

1559
01:58:06,973 --> 01:58:08,853
You stay in there for a second.

1560
01:58:08,853 --> 01:58:10,773
I, wait a minute, I go out...

1561
01:58:11,973 --> 01:58:15,353
Mr. Kim Dongsu?
You're under arrest for human trafficking charges.

1562
01:58:16,223 --> 01:58:17,313
Dongsu-hyung!

1563
01:58:24,903 --> 01:58:26,193
Where is Soyoung?

1564
01:58:28,003 --> 01:58:29,493
She turned herself in.

1565
01:58:32,363 --> 01:58:33,923
What about the other one?

1566
01:58:36,843 --> 01:58:38,173
I don't know.

1567
01:58:41,113 --> 01:58:42,963
- Take him away.
- Yes.

1568
01:58:55,343 --> 01:58:56,483
Let's go.

1569
01:59:22,423 --> 01:59:24,343
<i>Fortunately, there were no casualties.</i>

1570
01:59:24,853 --> 01:59:27,743
<i>The fire accident that occurred
in an officetel in Incheon</i>

1571
01:59:27,743 --> 01:59:30,973
<i>It turned out to be an accident
 caused by an electric short.</i>

1572
01:59:31,603 --> 01:59:32,643
<i>For the next news.</i>

1573
01:59:32,643 --> 01:59:35,993
<i>This is additional news about the body found in an underground shopping mall</i>

1574
01:59:35,993 --> 01:59:38,483
<i>in downtown Seoul early on the 8th.</i>

1575
01:59:38,483 --> 01:59:41,733
<i>The victim was Shin Mo, 
a gangster in Busan.</i>

1576
01:59:41,733 --> 01:59:44,113
<i>The police said that the
 victim was staying at a motel</i>

1577
01:59:44,183 --> 01:59:48,063
<i>It is said that about 40
million won in cash was found.</i>

1578
01:59:48,253 --> 01:59:52,663
<i>So the police left open the possibility 
of both crime and accident.</i>

1579
01:59:52,693 --> 01:59:54,333
The investigation is in progress.

1580
01:59:54,933 --> 01:59:56,293
<i>Yes, for the next news.</i>

1581
01:59:56,293 --> 01:59:58,063
<i>To celebrate Family Month in May,</i>

1582
01:59:58,073 --> 02:00:01,883
<i>Events were held all over the
 country for families</i>

1583
02:00:02,153 --> 02:00:03,553
<i>Seoul Children...</i>

1584
02:00:15,473 --> 02:00:17,203
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

1585
02:00:18,493 --> 02:00:19,733
What are you doing?

1586
02:00:20,483 --> 02:00:21,613
What do you think are you doing?

1587
02:00:36,743 --> 02:00:38,343
Woo Sung-ah!

1588
02:00:39,083 --> 02:00:40,863
Woo Sung-ah!

1589
02:00:47,093 --> 02:00:49,423
Did you have fun?
Shall we go into the sea?

1590
02:00:49,843 --> 02:00:51,313
Let's go in.

1591
02:00:55,553 --> 02:00:57,003
I love it. I love it.

1592
02:00:58,973 --> 02:01:00,103
Look over there.

1593
02:01:14,953 --> 02:01:16,623
