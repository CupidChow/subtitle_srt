<i>[Episode 09]</i>

16
00:01:31,539 --> 00:01:33,179
Dr. Ye.

17
00:01:38,380 --> 00:01:40,510
- President.
- You're just in time. You take over the mess upstairs.

18
00:01:40,510 --> 00:01:41,820
Okay.

19
00:01:55,300 --> 00:01:57,040
Ye Shilan.

20
00:02:16,539 --> 00:02:18,279
Ye Shilan.

21
00:02:19,819 --> 00:02:21,539
Ye Shilan.

22
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:24,559
What do you want from me?

23
00:02:25,700 --> 00:02:28,100
Where are you going?

24
00:02:28,819 --> 00:02:32,179
Right! I almost forgot.

25
00:02:32,179 --> 00:02:34,399
You're my superior.

26
00:02:36,060 --> 00:02:38,859
Do you have any other work for me to do?

27
00:02:40,179 --> 00:02:42,839
Can you stop talking like that?

28
00:02:42,839 --> 00:02:46,679
If not, don't follow me anymore.

29
00:02:48,299 --> 00:02:52,060
What I just did was merely to salvage some pride for you.

30
00:02:52,659 --> 00:02:54,620
Or do you really believe that you're wrong?

31
00:02:54,620 --> 00:02:57,100
Do you really want to apologize to Huang Bohao?

32
00:02:58,340 --> 00:03:00,019
Sober up!

33
00:03:00,019 --> 00:03:03,819
- Do you know that you were humiliating yourself?
- I'm not drunk.

34
00:03:04,980 --> 00:03:07,540
Did you forget that I can drink?

35
00:03:08,780 --> 00:03:12,219
Those shots of alcohol were nothing to me.

36
00:03:12,839 --> 00:03:15,980
It has nothing to do with how many shots you drank.

37
00:03:16,620 --> 00:03:18,900
You can look down on me.

38
00:03:19,819 --> 00:03:21,459
I don't care about what you think about me.

39
00:03:21,459 --> 00:03:25,019
I didn't look down upon you. It's you who has looked down upon yourself.

40
00:03:35,659 --> 00:03:40,139
The Ye Shilan I know is not like this.

41
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:45,519
The Ye Shilan I know is a kind person

42
00:03:45,519 --> 00:03:48,278
who might say that she is sorry for what she did, but the next time she sees someone in need,

43
00:03:48,279 --> 00:03:50,520
she will still lend a helping hand.

44
00:03:51,900 --> 00:03:55,720
The Ye Shilan I know doesn't like to boast.

45
00:03:55,720 --> 00:03:57,140
On the contrary, she is warmhearted,

46
00:03:57,140 --> 00:03:59,340
able to distinguish between right and wrong,

47
00:03:59,340 --> 00:04:01,900
and is a girl of justice.

48
00:04:02,639 --> 00:04:06,999
The Ye Shilan I know will never stop making progress and try the best she can

49
00:04:06,999 --> 00:04:11,420
even if she has to do something she doesn't like to do.

50
00:04:13,140 --> 00:04:15,579
The Ye Shilan you know...

51
00:04:16,780 --> 00:04:19,020
is merely someone...

52
00:04:20,859 --> 00:04:25,598
that you fantasize about, someone that can assist you to complete your work.

53
00:04:29,259 --> 00:04:31,320
That's not true.

54
00:04:32,380 --> 00:04:34,420
You're an outstanding man.

55
00:04:35,660 --> 00:04:38,459
You have financial privilege and capability.

56
00:04:38,459 --> 00:04:42,020
If you want to do something, you can just go for it.

57
00:04:42,699 --> 00:04:45,059
But I'm not like you.

58
00:04:46,540 --> 00:04:49,679
I have to deal with a lot of realistic problems.

59
00:04:51,060 --> 00:04:55,060
I have to survive. I have to pay rent.

60
00:04:55,060 --> 00:04:57,320
I have to buy my own apartment.

61
00:04:59,419 --> 00:05:02,040
I really need this job.

62
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:05,419
I need to stay in this hospital, doing my job as a pediatrician,

63
00:05:05,419 --> 00:05:09,419
because I don't want my mom to always worry about me.

64
00:05:09,419 --> 00:05:12,010
I want to live a better life through my own effort.

65
00:05:12,010 --> 00:05:15,450
Is there a problem with that? Is there?

66
00:05:19,940 --> 00:05:21,740
No.

67
00:05:24,519 --> 00:05:25,959
Fine.

68
00:05:27,699 --> 00:05:31,619
Then, would you please stop imposing your standard on me?

69
00:05:34,340 --> 00:05:37,700
Just take me for a coward.

70
00:05:38,699 --> 00:05:42,219
I really can't afford to offend Chief Huang again.

71
00:05:43,259 --> 00:05:45,740
You might not give a damn about being the president.

72
00:05:45,740 --> 00:05:48,780
You can quit whenever you want.

73
00:05:48,780 --> 00:05:51,000
But I can't.

74
00:05:51,579 --> 00:05:54,999
I need this job. I need to stay.

75
00:05:54,999 --> 00:05:57,379
Aren't we friends?

76
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:00,560
In your mind,

77
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:03,719
am I a selfish person who will sacrifice friends for my own advantage?

78
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:09,299
In your mind, am I a person who you can't trust and rely on?

79
00:06:20,060 --> 00:06:22,060
Don't be anxious.

80
00:06:22,660 --> 00:06:24,860
Don't worry about it anymore.

81
00:06:25,859 --> 00:06:27,820
Trust me.

82
00:06:31,780 --> 00:06:34,380
I'll be responsible for you no matter what happens.

Don't smash glasses anymore.

112
00:09:27,699 --> 00:09:29,679
How dangerous.

113
00:09:29,679 --> 00:09:32,359
Safety comes before acting cool.

114
00:09:33,019 --> 00:09:35,820
Did you think I was acting cool?

115
00:09:35,820 --> 00:09:38,300
Slightly exaggerated.

116
00:09:39,540 --> 00:09:41,919
Then did you think I was cool?

117
00:09:42,780 --> 00:09:45,760
My mind totally went blank that time.

118
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:48,380
The only thing I felt was embarrassment.

119
00:09:48,380 --> 00:09:50,760
But in retrospect,

120
00:09:52,379 --> 00:09:54,400
it was so-so.

121
00:10:02,220 --> 00:10:04,019
I'm sorry.

122
00:10:05,139 --> 00:10:07,580
Why are you sorry?

123
00:10:07,580 --> 00:10:11,440
Because my self-righteousness made you suffer.

124
00:10:12,900 --> 00:10:13,879
I was talking nonsense.

125
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:17,619
In fact, I should have noticed your emotions sooner,

126
00:10:17,619 --> 00:10:21,699
and make my thoughts and plans clear with you.

127
00:10:22,180 --> 00:10:23,379
Believe me.

128
00:10:23,379 --> 00:10:26,759
I'll deal with your problem in the Pediatric Department properly.

129
00:10:26,759 --> 00:10:31,420
And... if you don't want to be my assistant,

130
00:10:31,420 --> 00:10:34,339
I can also send you back to the Pediatric Department.

131
00:10:36,819 --> 00:10:39,980
Let me finish my work first as planned.

132
00:10:39,980 --> 00:10:42,900
I'm already familiar with my current post now.

133
00:10:42,900 --> 00:10:46,300
Unless you're not satisfied with my performance and want to replace me.

134
00:10:47,379 --> 00:10:50,039
Now you're putting me on the spot.

135
00:10:51,619 --> 00:10:53,220
Lanlan.

136
00:10:54,699 --> 00:10:56,958
- Mom.
- Why are you sitting here? Why don't you go home?

137
00:10:56,958 --> 00:10:59,458
Mom, what are you doing out here?

138
00:10:59,458 --> 00:11:00,818
I was just about to go home.

139
00:11:00,818 --> 00:11:02,378
You're staying out so late that I was starting to worry about you.

140
00:11:02,378 --> 00:11:03,959
So I came out to have a check.

141
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:06,198
I'm an adult. There's nothing for you to worry about.

142
00:11:06,198 --> 00:11:07,219
Let's go.

143
00:11:07,219 --> 00:11:08,138
Let's go home.

144
00:11:08,138 --> 00:11:10,198
- I'm exhausted.
- What is it?

145
00:11:10,198 --> 00:11:12,699
Auntie, good evening.

146
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:18,659
Lu?

147
00:11:18,659 --> 00:11:20,880
Auntie, you know me?

148
00:11:21,619 --> 00:11:23,138
I've seen your photo.

149
00:11:23,138 --> 00:11:25,880
Aren't you Lanlan's boyfriend?

150
00:11:30,019 --> 00:11:33,239
You came back early from a business trip?

151
00:11:36,699 --> 00:11:40,100
Why didn't you introduce him to me just now?

152
00:11:40,100 --> 00:11:42,420
He's busy.

153
00:11:42,420 --> 00:11:44,699
A few minutes won't matter.

154
00:11:45,379 --> 00:11:48,179
We planned to have dinner together in a few days.

155
00:11:48,179 --> 00:11:51,540
We wanted to give you a surprise. Right?

156
00:11:52,019 --> 00:11:54,040
Yeah.

157
00:11:54,040 --> 00:11:57,880
Young people like you love surprises.

158
00:11:59,039 --> 00:12:01,020
I remember you still have other plans.

159
00:12:01,020 --> 00:12:03,899
You should go now. Don't keep your friends waiting.

160
00:12:04,420 --> 00:12:07,658
Right! Autnie, I have an appointment later.

161
00:12:07,658 --> 00:12:09,279
I have to go.

162
00:12:09,279 --> 00:12:11,880
Then we'll talk about it over dinner this weekend.

163
00:12:11,880 --> 00:12:15,419
Okay. I should let you go.

164
00:12:15,919 --> 00:12:17,519
I'll go first.

165
00:12:17,519 --> 00:12:19,280
Bye.

166
00:12:31,110 --> 00:12:34,320
I think Lu looks better than in the photo.

167
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:36,690
Taller and more handsome.

168
00:12:36,699 --> 00:12:38,600
Full of vitality.

169
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:40,339
- Indeed.
- He's nice.

170
00:12:40,339 --> 00:12:41,960
Let's go.

171
00:12:45,479 --> 00:12:48,119
Did you cry just now?

172
00:12:48,119 --> 00:12:50,139
Nope.

173
00:12:50,139 --> 00:12:52,800
Your eyes can't fool me.

174
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:55,859
Why? Did he bully you?

175
00:12:55,859 --> 00:12:59,399
No. He's been good to me.

176
00:12:59,399 --> 00:13:02,479
He even came back earlier to see me.

177
00:13:04,579 --> 00:13:09,418
So you were so happy that you were moved to tears because he returned early?

178
00:13:11,059 --> 00:13:13,640
Yes, I am.

179
00:13:15,579 --> 00:13:18,219
Good. Seeing you two get along so well with each other,

180
00:13:18,219 --> 00:13:20,459
I feel relieved.

181
00:13:43,046 --> 00:13:44,459
<i>[Ye Shilan]</i>

182
00:13:50,900 --> 00:13:52,000
<i>Hello.</i>

183
00:13:52,100 --> 00:13:54,400
Hello, President. Did you get home?

184
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:55,700
Yes.

185
00:13:55,739 --> 00:13:58,179
Thank you so much for what just happened with my mom!

186
00:13:58,179 --> 00:14:02,040
<i>Stop. No rush to say thank you.</i>

187
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:05,099
Sorry, President.

188
00:14:05,099 --> 00:14:06,938
I can explain what just happened.

189
00:14:06,938 --> 00:14:08,799
<i>Wait.</i>

190
00:14:08,799 --> 00:14:10,299
Do you work tomorrow?

191
00:14:10,299 --> 00:14:12,059
<i>Of course.</i>

192
00:14:12,059 --> 00:14:14,919
I'm worn out. Just leave it till tomorrow.

193
00:14:14,919 --> 00:14:17,780
<i>I want to hear your explanation in person tomorrow.</i>

194
00:14:17,780 --> 00:14:20,159
That's all. Bye.

195
00:14:34,980 --> 00:14:37,960

<i>On the contrary, she is warmhearted, is able to distinguish between right and wrong,</i>

<i>Are you still in the mood to think about how he praised you?</i>

211
00:15:48,440 --> 00:15:50,240

218
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:21,699
Why did she tell her mom that I was her boyfriend?

219
00:16:22,980 --> 00:16:25,580
What is she thinking about?

220

222
00:16:40,420 --> 00:16:44,780
Don't think that he is helping you by not letting you

223
00:16:44,780 --> 00:16:47,360
<i>file those documents for me.</i>

224
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:49,339
<i>In fact, he is doing harm to you.</i>

225
00:16:49,339 --> 00:16:51,240
<i>He's not only doing harm to you,</i>

226
00:16:51,240 --> 00:16:55,039
<i>but also damaging the interests of Anxing Hospital.</i>

227
00:16:55,039 --> 00:16:56,800
<i>But he doesn't care about that.</i>

228
00:16:56,800 --> 00:16:58,939
<i>He's the son of nobility.</i>

229
00:16:58,939 --> 00:17:00,699
<i>And you?</i>

230
00:17:00,699 --> 00:17:03,419
<i>You're nothing at all.</i>

231
00:17:03,419 --> 00:17:06,139
<i>So why did you do those crazy things with him?</i>

232
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:11,000
<i>I heard you're going on a blind date to get married.</i>

233
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:14,240
<i>How would a woman fall in love with you?</i>

234
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:15,978
<i>As I see, you don't have to live with a wife,</i>

235
00:17:15,978 --> 00:17:18,440
<i>because it's good to live with your phone.</i>

236
00:17:18,500 --> 00:17:23,700
<i>Usually, we always call for equality between men and women. Gender Equality.</i>

237
00:17:23,700 --> 00:17:27,900
<i>But once you encounter something, little things need to be specialized.</i>

238
00:17:27,939 --> 00:17:30,419
<i>We don't know what your specialization is.</i>

239
00:17:30,419 --> 00:17:33,080
<i>Or if it's really special. Is it true or not?</i>

240
00:17:33,700 --> 00:17:37,500
<i>Think before you take any action.</i>

241
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:41,140
<i>Why did you do all of these things?</i>

242
00:17:41,140 --> 00:17:45,719
<i>At least I am the chief of our department.</i>

243
00:17:45,719 --> 00:17:48,400
And... our colleagues are here with us.

244
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:53,359
Don't you think... you should say something?

245
00:17:56,080 --> 00:17:57,739
All right.

246
00:18:01,119 --> 00:18:04,699
Because it is a temporary meeting, I don't want to prolong it.

247
00:18:04,699 --> 00:18:07,420
This was enough for you to know what happened.

248
00:18:07,420 --> 00:18:10,880
Chief Huang, do you have anything to say?

249
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:14,280
President, what do you want me to say?

250
00:18:14,280 --> 00:18:18,520
I admit I was badmouthing you behind your back.

251
00:18:18,520 --> 00:18:20,279
But I would like to ask all of you here,

252
00:18:20,280 --> 00:18:23,339
who didn't talk about others behind their backs?

253
00:18:24,700 --> 00:18:29,359
However, President. If you need, I can apologize to you.

254
00:18:29,359 --> 00:18:31,600
Chief Huang really knows how to pick the key points.

255
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:34,420
You can ignore the bad things you said about me.

256
00:18:34,420 --> 00:18:35,499
Let's talk about the others.

257
00:18:35,499 --> 00:18:37,038
There's nothing more.

258
00:18:37,038 --> 00:18:39,218
I was drunk. That's it. Those were jokes.

259
00:18:39,218 --> 00:18:41,219
You like drinking so much.

260
00:18:41,219 --> 00:18:43,319
You don't drink at work, do you?

261
00:18:43,319 --> 00:18:47,500
No way. You are questioning my medical ethics.

262
00:18:47,500 --> 00:18:49,559
I was just telling a joke Chief Huang.

263
00:18:49,559 --> 00:18:51,519
Why are you so irritated?

264
00:18:53,960 --> 00:18:57,738
When you make jokes with them, if they cannot dispute it,

265
00:18:57,738 --> 00:18:59,760
or reciprocate your joke,

266
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:01,420
then it's not a joke.

267
00:19:01,420 --> 00:19:05,959
And I believe what you said reflects what you think from the inside.

268
00:19:05,959 --> 00:19:07,679
You look down on your subordinates.

269
00:19:07,679 --> 00:19:09,959
You don't respect women either.

270
00:19:14,859 --> 00:19:18,840
Fine. I admit. I drank a lot. I was drunk.

271
00:19:18,840 --> 00:19:21,419
I did make some inappropriate jokes.

272
00:19:21,419 --> 00:19:23,200
And there was also a cognitive bias.

273
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:24,900
But I also want to ask you, President.

274
00:19:24,900 --> 00:19:29,340
Is recording a video secretly a proper way?

275
00:19:29,340 --> 00:19:32,799
If so, then we can simply put cameras

276
00:19:32,799 --> 00:19:34,258
in every department of the hospital,

277
00:19:34,258 --> 00:19:36,978
and let everyone wear a recorder. Agree?

278
00:19:37,499 --> 00:19:39,180
Chief Huang, you misunderstand me.

279
00:19:39,180 --> 00:19:41,400
I didn't record this video.

280
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:44,219
Actually, a pediatrician reported the problem to the President's Mailbox in a letter

281
00:19:44,219 --> 00:19:48,918
saying that Chief Huang used his authority to ask his staff to help with personal work.

282
00:19:48,918 --> 00:19:50,960
Now your book has been published, but you didn't even express your gratitude

283
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:52,579
even in the preface or the acknowledgment.

284
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:56,900
They also said that you enjoy the feeling of being an overlord in the name of team building.

285
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:01,900
They were all upset and offered to provide evidence.

286
00:20:05,919 --> 00:20:09,479
Currently, Ye Shilan is the president's assistant.

287
00:20:09,479 --> 00:20:11,918
Her title is not a pediatrician.

288
00:20:11,918 --> 00:20:15,538
I think she did it solely because she wanted to kiss the president's ass.

289
00:20:21,940 --> 00:20:24,119
Chief Huang, you have got it wrong.

290
00:20:24,119 --> 00:20:26,660
The doctor that President mentioned was me.

291
00:20:45,580 --> 00:20:49,720
Chief Huang, I've warned you not to drink too much.

292
00:20:49,720 --> 00:20:52,300
Every time you drink, you can't watch your mouth.

293
00:20:52,300 --> 00:20:54,639
You should be more careful of your words and behavior

294
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:56,840
in front of your subordinates.

295
00:20:57,460 --> 00:21:00,299
Don't run away from your mistakes.

296
00:21:00,299 --> 00:21:03,459
Just apologize. Don't waste our time.

297
00:21:12,700 --> 00:21:15,699
Okay. I apologize.

298
00:21:15,699 --> 00:21:19,300
President, sorry.

299
00:21:19,300 --> 00:21:21,260
I'm not the one you should apologize to.

300
00:21:21,260 --> 00:21:23,860
You should apologize to the other colleagues in the Pediatric Department.

301
00:21:27,339 --> 00:21:28,559
Okay.

302
00:21:28,559 --> 00:21:32,720
I hereby apologize to all my fellow colleagues in the Pediatric Department.

303
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:35,359
I'm sorry. I was wrong.

304
00:21:39,780 --> 00:21:45,079
Dr. Zhong, please pass on Chief Huang's apologies to the other pediatricians

305
00:21:45,079 --> 00:21:47,160
who didn't have time to come to the meeting.

306
00:21:47,160 --> 00:21:48,660
Sure.

307
00:21:50,219 --> 00:21:53,079
Okay. Since Chief Huang has apologized,

308
00:21:53,079 --> 00:21:55,678
I don't want to take up much of your time.

309
00:21:55,678 --> 00:21:58,518
I'll be straight to the point about my opinion on the punishment of Chief Huang.

310
00:21:58,518 --> 00:22:02,639
Over the years, Chief Huang has really attracted a lot of quality clients for Anxing Hospital.

311
00:22:02,639 --> 00:22:05,079
As a doctor, his medical skill is undoubtedly outstanding.

312
00:22:05,079 --> 00:22:07,079
Patients are satisfied with his treatments.

313
00:22:07,079 --> 00:22:08,939
He's a very good doctor indeed.

314
00:22:08,939 --> 00:22:10,960
However, according to the current situation,

315
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:13,999
he is no longer fit to be the Chief of Pediatrics.

316
00:22:14,739 --> 00:22:19,079
So my advice is for his pay and benefits to remain the same,

317
00:22:19,079 --> 00:22:21,400
but he is no longer serving as the Chief of Pediatrics.

318
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:23,858
The new chief will be recruited from

319
00:22:23,858 --> 00:22:25,978
among the candidates recommended by headhunters

320
00:22:25,978 --> 00:22:27,038
and other senior physicians in Pediatrics.

321
00:22:27,038 --> 00:22:29,119
Does everyone have a different opinion?

322
00:22:33,499 --> 00:22:36,180
Please raise your hand if you agree.

323
00:22:43,420 --> 00:22:45,060
Agreed.

324
00:22:51,460 --> 00:22:53,640
What about our colleagues in Pediatrics?

325
00:23:01,940 --> 00:23:03,539
As the chief of a department,

326
00:23:03,539 --> 00:23:05,638
you are supposed to set an example in everything you do.

327
00:23:05,638 --> 00:23:08,820
Since he failed to do so, it's reasonable to replace him.

328
00:23:08,820 --> 00:23:11,639
It's a warning to us all.

329
00:23:13,700 --> 00:23:15,280
All right.

330
00:23:17,780 --> 00:23:22,239
Chief Huang, if you still want to be a good doctor respected by patients

331
00:23:22,239 --> 00:23:24,339
and a good author liked by readers,

332
00:23:24,339 --> 00:23:26,739
please be careful with your words and actions.

333
00:23:30,019 --> 00:23:32,639
Here, I also need to confess my fault.

334
00:23:32,639 --> 00:23:36,338
Approving the validity of Dr. Zhong's video is an extreme means, which is a bad example.

335
00:23:36,338 --> 00:23:38,918
I'll delete the video after the meeting.

336
00:23:38,918 --> 00:23:41,880
Please do not discuss this any further.

337
00:23:41,880 --> 00:23:44,879
Okay. The meeting is adjourned.

338
00:24:06,759 --> 00:24:08,580
Dr. Ye.

339
00:24:09,680 --> 00:24:11,518
If you're too bored to be here alone,

340
00:24:11,518 --> 00:24:12,998
you can go back to Pediatrics when you're free.

341
00:24:12,998 --> 00:24:14,200
Let us help you relieve the monotony.

342
00:24:14,200 --> 00:24:15,859
Okay.

343
00:24:15,859 --> 00:24:18,580
Thanks a lot for what you've done about this.

344
00:24:18,580 --> 00:24:20,059
No.

345
00:24:20,059 --> 00:24:22,579
I should thank you.

346
00:24:22,579 --> 00:24:26,880
If you hadn't taken the lead, I wouldn't have stood out.

347
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:29,539
If you had to say thank you, you should thank the president.

348
00:24:29,539 --> 00:24:31,259
It was all his plan.

349
00:24:31,259 --> 00:24:33,938
You're right. We should thank the president.

350
00:24:33,938 --> 00:24:35,420
Okay, I'd better let you go.

351
00:24:35,420 --> 00:24:37,340
Dr. Ye, I shall go back to my office.

352
00:24:59,259 --> 00:25:00,559
Come in.

353
00:25:03,060 --> 00:25:06,540
President. Time for lunch.

354
00:25:06,540 --> 00:25:08,560
Can I buy you lunch?

355
00:25:13,979 --> 00:25:15,219
Are you sure?

356
00:25:15,219 --> 00:25:16,300
Yes.

357
00:25:16,300 --> 00:25:18,420
What's the lunch for?

358
00:25:19,060 --> 00:25:21,160
You've gone through a tiring morning,

359
00:25:21,160 --> 00:25:23,498
and you've defended justice for the Pediatric Department.

360
00:25:23,498 --> 00:25:26,740
As a pediatrician, it's what I should do.

361
00:25:26,740 --> 00:25:28,060
I see.

362
00:25:28,060 --> 00:25:31,500
How about inviting other pediatricians with us together?

363
00:25:32,800 --> 00:25:35,499
No. The two of us will be better.

364
00:25:36,019 --> 00:25:39,038
I have some personal issues to discuss with you.

365
00:25:39,038 --> 00:25:43,180
Sure. I'll be all ears. Don't forget to lock the door.

366
00:25:57,019 --> 00:26:01,080
- President.
- Isn't it too lavish for a work meal?

367
00:26:01,080 --> 00:26:05,418
Eating more meat at lunch can give you more energy in the afternoon.

368
00:26:08,959 --> 00:26:11,719
No, President. Let me do it.

369
00:26:18,279 --> 00:26:20,439
Have a try. Thank you for your work.

370
00:26:20,439 --> 00:26:22,259
Thanks.

371
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:31,420
Please eat more.

372
00:26:32,019 --> 00:26:34,240
Okay, you can stop.

373
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:37,459
I'll handle the cooking so that you can focus on what you want to say.

374
00:26:40,379 --> 00:26:42,660
Here's the thing.

375
00:26:42,660 --> 00:26:44,939
My mom nagged me to find a boyfriend,

376
00:26:44,939 --> 00:26:47,639
so I lied to her that I already had one.

377
00:26:47,639 --> 00:26:50,960
But after telling too many lies, she got suspicious.

378
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:53,580
She had to make me send a picture of me and my boyfriend.

379
00:26:53,580 --> 00:26:56,260
And you were drunk that day,

380
00:26:56,260 --> 00:26:59,059
so I did something stupid.

381
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:02,000
You did it in Taoyuan Village.

382
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:04,000
You kept it a secret for so long.

383
00:27:04,780 --> 00:27:07,699
I admit I took a chance.

384
00:27:08,360 --> 00:27:09,599
Where's the picture?

385
00:27:09,599 --> 00:27:11,000
I deleted it.

386
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:12,919
Didn't you send it to your mom?

387
00:27:12,919 --> 00:27:14,880
Send it to me.

388
00:27:37,920 --> 00:27:40,880
No wonder I dreamed of being next to you.

389
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:42,980
You dreamed of me?

390
00:27:44,599 --> 00:27:47,419
Might be some fragments of memories stocked in my brain.

391
00:27:48,920 --> 00:27:53,399
But you did frighten me when you opened your eyes suddenly that night.

392
00:27:53,399 --> 00:27:55,580
But luckily you were drunk as a skunk.

393
00:27:55,580 --> 00:27:57,199
Luckily?

394
00:28:02,919 --> 00:28:05,638
Weren't you determined that I was a medicinal wine seller at that time?

395
00:28:05,638 --> 00:28:07,699
Why did you send the picture to your mom?

396
00:28:07,699 --> 00:28:09,400
Were you so desperate for a man?

397
00:28:09,400 --> 00:28:12,479
If I had had an alternative at that time, I wouldn't have chosen you.

398
00:28:13,700 --> 00:28:15,900
Do you think I'm not qualified to be your boyfriend?

399
00:28:15,900 --> 00:28:18,979
It was you who had said that I was so desperate for a man.

400
00:28:18,979 --> 00:28:21,019
I can say that. But you can't.

401
00:28:21,019 --> 00:28:22,480
Why?

402
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:24,179
It's like you're looking in a mirror.

403
00:28:24,179 --> 00:28:27,519
You can complainthat you're ugly,

404
00:28:27,519 --> 00:28:30,420
but I can't just agree and say, "Yeah, you're ugly." Right?

405
00:28:30,420 --> 00:28:32,379
Got it?

406
00:28:34,139 --> 00:28:35,900
Got it.

407
00:28:35,900 --> 00:28:38,079
I'll give you another chance.

408
00:28:39,499 --> 00:28:41,400
Let me think about it.

409
00:28:43,119 --> 00:28:44,739
Think carefully.

410
00:28:44,739 --> 00:28:47,998
Regain your ability to read people's minds that you had when you were a flower seller.

411
00:28:54,180 --> 00:28:58,299
Although I thought you were a medicinal wine seller,

412
00:28:58,299 --> 00:29:01,599
I had to say that you had a charming look and a good figure.

413
00:29:01,599 --> 00:29:03,438
You were tipsy that night.

414
00:29:03,439 --> 00:29:06,460
Your cheeks were flushed which looked sexy.

415
00:29:06,460 --> 00:29:08,819
Seeing such a cute guy like you,

416
00:29:08,819 --> 00:29:10,858
everyone would say, "I wish this were my boyfriend."

417
00:29:10,858 --> 00:29:13,800
You're an excellent boyfriend to be with.

418
00:29:17,460 --> 00:29:21,699
President, so you're a fan of compliments like this?

419
00:29:21,699 --> 00:29:23,939
Who wouldn't be happy to be complimented?

420
00:29:25,580 --> 00:29:28,459
This is completely my fault.

421
00:29:28,459 --> 00:29:30,070
Sorry.

422
00:29:30,600 --> 00:29:32,200
Your attitude of apologizing is way too good.

423
00:29:32,200 --> 00:29:35,419
Acknowledging mistakes can make a big difference.

424
00:29:35,419 --> 00:29:37,018
I should be the one to say this, right?

425
00:29:37,018 --> 00:29:40,539
I know in your heart that you agree.

426
00:29:40,539 --> 00:29:42,400
You have become cunning.

427
00:29:42,839 --> 00:29:45,400
I learned it from you.

428
00:29:47,139 --> 00:29:52,600
President, since you have been so generous that you chose to forgive me,

429
00:29:52,600 --> 00:29:55,100
can you do me a favor

430
00:29:55,100 --> 00:29:57,539
to help me with the dinner with my mom?

431
00:29:58,420 --> 00:29:59,339
Of course...

432
00:29:59,339 --> 00:30:01,519
- Really?
- No

433
00:30:06,780 --> 00:30:09,939
The meat looks delicious. Try a bite?

434
00:30:11,460 --> 00:30:13,260
Thank you, President.

435
00:30:23,339 --> 00:30:24,978
It should have been my treat.

436
00:30:24,978 --> 00:30:27,039
Why did you pay the bill?

437
00:30:27,039 --> 00:30:28,459
The exploited are afraid to speak.

438
00:30:28,459 --> 00:30:30,370
I'm aware of it.

439
00:30:30,879 --> 00:30:33,660
I really want to apologize.

440
00:30:34,479 --> 00:30:36,960
What you really want is to ask me to have dinner with your mother. Right?

441
00:30:40,019 --> 00:30:41,900
Please don't turn me down.

442
00:30:41,900 --> 00:30:45,019
My mom was satisfied with you.

443
00:30:45,840 --> 00:30:47,879
Thank your mom for me.

444
00:30:49,420 --> 00:30:54,300
Did you forget that you promised to have dinner with her last night?

445
00:30:54,300 --> 00:30:57,018
You told me to go along with what your mom said.

446
00:30:57,018 --> 00:30:59,280
Now you're accusing me.

447
00:31:01,940 --> 00:31:03,160
Go on.

448
00:31:03,160 --> 00:31:05,979
What other bizarre reasons do you have? I'm all ears.

449
00:31:07,139 --> 00:31:12,439
President, I don't know if I should say this.

450
00:31:12,439 --> 00:31:14,300
Go on.

451
00:31:14,300 --> 00:31:16,338
If you have a crush on a girl,

452
00:31:16,338 --> 00:31:18,498
don't keep retorting what she said

453
00:31:18,498 --> 00:31:20,299
as if you're having a debate.

454
00:31:20,299 --> 00:31:23,020
This way you will not be able to make a girlfriend.

455
00:31:24,580 --> 00:31:26,860
Why do you worry about this?

456
00:31:26,860 --> 00:31:29,179
It just came to my mind.

457
00:31:31,180 --> 00:31:36,600
Ye Shilan, I found that you are talking to me in a more and more audacious way.

458
00:31:37,660 --> 00:31:39,339
Am I?

459
00:31:39,339 --> 00:31:42,139
Then shall I correct it?

460
00:31:42,700 --> 00:31:44,699
Why change?

461
00:31:44,699 --> 00:31:46,660
I like you like this.

462
00:31:50,219 --> 00:31:52,539
Just be comfortable.

463
00:31:52,539 --> 00:31:54,399
Fine.

464
00:31:54,400 --> 00:31:56,959
You've seen me at my most embarrassing moment.

465
00:31:56,959 --> 00:31:58,980
There is nothing more for me to care about.

466
00:31:59,640 --> 00:32:02,178
I see. Decide to let yourself go?

467
00:32:07,619 --> 00:32:09,100
Don't wanna persuade me anymore?

468
00:32:09,100 --> 00:32:10,879
I can't.

469
00:32:10,879 --> 00:32:13,160
So you decided to give up that easily?

470
00:32:13,700 --> 00:32:16,800
Or... you can take the initiative to agree?

471
00:32:17,460 --> 00:32:20,960
Do you think I'm putting on airs?

472
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:26,000
I think, as a righteous friend, you will help me.

473
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:28,600
I can. Now you've learned to use reverse psychology on me.

474
00:32:29,619 --> 00:32:31,500
So you were just bragging.

475
00:32:31,500 --> 00:32:33,979
Who was the one who swore last night

476
00:32:33,979 --> 00:32:37,159
that he would be responsible for me no matter what happens.

477
00:32:37,159 --> 00:32:39,059
I was talking about work.

478
00:32:39,059 --> 00:32:42,079
Do I still have to be responsible for finding you a boyfriend?

479
00:32:42,079 --> 00:32:43,520
You can.

480
00:32:43,520 --> 00:32:46,339
How about I tell my mom that I broke up with you,

481
00:32:46,339 --> 00:32:48,219
and I got a new one?

482
00:32:48,840 --> 00:32:51,399
As if we were a couple.

483
00:32:53,660 --> 00:32:55,479
Wait a second.

484
00:33:02,940 --> 00:33:04,180
Here's your flower.

485
00:33:04,180 --> 00:33:06,620
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

486
00:33:14,460 --> 00:33:16,119
For you.

487
00:33:16,119 --> 00:33:17,520
What is it for?

488
00:33:17,520 --> 00:33:21,719
Yellow roses represent my apology.

489
00:33:22,800 --> 00:33:24,720
You nearly scared me.

490
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:28,338
I thought you took it seriously and decided to confess that you loved me.

491
00:33:29,039 --> 00:33:32,919
If someone has to confess first, it should be you.

492
00:33:32,919 --> 00:33:34,918
It seems that I did not know you well enough before.

493
00:33:34,918 --> 00:33:38,158
I didn't realize that you have so many petty tricks in your head.

494
00:33:38,158 --> 00:33:41,020
I used to see you as nothing but the president.

495
00:33:41,020 --> 00:33:44,698
Besides, I owe you, it's natural that I have to restrain my behavior.

496
00:33:45,499 --> 00:33:47,360
It's time to get to know you again.

497
00:33:47,360 --> 00:33:51,000
You will know me. There will be surprises.

498
00:33:56,320 --> 00:33:59,940
Let's go. We should go back to work in 30 minutes.

499
00:34:01,499 --> 00:34:04,919
Ye Shilan, so you want me to act as a loyal friend to have dinner with your mom?

500
00:34:04,919 --> 00:34:06,219
It's not possible.

501
00:34:06,219 --> 00:34:07,640
What are you conditions?

502
00:34:07,640 --> 00:34:10,319
Name it. As long as I can do it.

503
00:34:16,859 --> 00:34:18,579
Take it.

504
00:34:22,859 --> 00:34:25,100
I can't.

505
00:34:25,100 --> 00:34:27,000
Take it.

506
00:34:42,360 --> 00:34:44,020
Are you dreaming?

507
00:34:44,020 --> 00:34:46,179
I want you to take it back to the office for me.

508
00:34:46,179 --> 00:34:49,199
I need to buy something before returning to the office.

509
00:34:54,220 --> 00:34:57,179
Got it. Okay.

510
00:34:57,759 --> 00:35:00,220
Did you think I was going to say I love you?

511
00:35:00,220 --> 00:35:02,320
I didn't!

512
00:35:03,160 --> 00:35:06,779
Great. I haven't figured out what I want from you. So let's talk about it later.

513
00:35:06,779 --> 00:35:09,558
Just leave me an IOU when we're back in the office.

514
00:35:11,740 --> 00:35:13,919
You did that on purpose, didn't you?

515
00:35:15,059 --> 00:35:16,719
I hate you.

516
00:35:30,020 --> 00:35:32,419
I, Ye Shilan, ask Lu Zhaoxi to pretend to be my boyfriend.

517
00:35:32,419 --> 00:35:36,899
Excuse me. Please look at the camera. Thank you.

518
00:35:40,700 --> 00:35:44,598
I, Ye Shilan, ask Lu Zhaoxi to pretend to be my boyfriend, to have dinner with my mom.

519
00:35:44,598 --> 00:35:48,398
I hereby unconditionally grant him a request provided that it is not illegal.

520
00:35:48,398 --> 00:35:51,119
All above is my IOU. Over.

521
00:35:52,080 --> 00:35:56,600
Am I such a dishonest person that you need me to film this IOU video.

522
00:35:56,600 --> 00:35:59,080
It was a pretty ridiculous request.

523
00:35:59,080 --> 00:36:01,860
I'd better keep the evidence.

524
00:36:01,860 --> 00:36:04,099
Are you afraid of me falling in love with you for real?

525
00:36:04,099 --> 00:36:07,559
I'm just afraid that I'll forget my original intention.

526
00:36:07,559 --> 00:36:11,978
From my perspective, you're just addicted to making fun of me. Aren't you?

527
00:36:11,978 --> 00:36:16,160
President, I don't know if I should say this.

528
00:36:16,700 --> 00:36:17,779
Then don't say it.

529
00:36:17,779 --> 00:36:20,639
I really sympathize with your future girlfriend,

530
00:36:20,639 --> 00:36:22,740
who has to fight with wits and courage with you every day.

531
00:36:22,740 --> 00:36:25,059
That will be really hard.

532
00:36:25,059 --> 00:36:27,100
You just said on the way back

533
00:36:27,100 --> 00:36:29,779
that I may not find a girlfriend, didn't you?

534
00:36:30,640 --> 00:36:31,578
Fine.

535
00:36:31,578 --> 00:36:34,080
So, you don't have to worry about it.

536
00:36:34,080 --> 00:36:36,139
No one will be my victim.

537
00:36:41,519 --> 00:36:43,900
Apology accepted.

538
00:36:43,900 --> 00:36:45,800
I forgive you.

539
00:36:51,619 --> 00:36:54,619
I've only been on a few night shifts.

540
00:36:54,619 --> 00:36:57,460
When have you and Lu Zhaoxi become so close?

541
00:36:57,460 --> 00:37:01,418
He's just going to have dinner with my mom tomorrow. Don't over-interpret it.

542
00:37:01,419 --> 00:37:04,338
Pretending to be a boyfriend is the classic beginning of a romance.

543
00:37:04,338 --> 00:37:08,660
What romance. It's nothing but a mistake caused by the domino effect.

544
00:37:08,660 --> 00:37:13,539
Think about it. Was Lu Zhaoxi willing to pretend to be your boyfriend?

545
00:37:14,719 --> 00:37:17,419
Maybe. Maybe not.

546
00:37:17,419 --> 00:37:20,319
It's like a trap whether he agrees or not.

547
00:37:20,319 --> 00:37:24,459
If it is a trap, it is a trap of love.

548
00:37:24,459 --> 00:37:27,539
So what is your relationship with Lu Zhaoxi now?

549
00:37:27,539 --> 00:37:29,760
Employer and employee?

550
00:37:31,479 --> 00:37:36,479
And friends of the opposite sex

551
00:37:36,479 --> 00:37:38,439
who are willing to help each other?

552
00:37:46,360 --> 00:37:48,479
In addition to our relationship at work,

553
00:37:48,479 --> 00:37:52,238
we can also be considered as good friends who can joke with each other.

554
00:37:52,959 --> 00:37:55,499
Are you in desperate need of friends?

555
00:37:55,499 --> 00:37:57,740
Is it a bad thing to have one more friend?

556
00:37:59,660 --> 00:38:02,700
How many girls have become your friends,

557
00:38:02,700 --> 00:38:04,299
not your girlfriends because of your jokes?

558
00:38:04,299 --> 00:38:06,780
That means we're destined to be friends.

559
00:38:06,780 --> 00:38:11,019
Sometimes, you have to think in a different way when dealing with love affairs.

560
00:38:11,019 --> 00:38:12,618
You shouldn't nip your affection in the bud

561
00:38:12,618 --> 00:38:15,899
with your rational analysis whenever there is a spark of love.

562
00:38:15,899 --> 00:38:18,160
Then I believe when true love sparks my heart,

563
00:38:18,160 --> 00:38:22,178
it will be burning, it will be irresistible, and it will be unstoppable.

564
00:38:22,178 --> 00:38:26,220
Gosh. Which fantasy world are you from?

565
00:38:26,220 --> 00:38:29,718
Who is your love mentor? I need to talk to him.

566
00:38:29,718 --> 00:38:32,759
In short, you should find an opportunity to explain to her as soon as possible.

567
00:38:32,759 --> 00:38:35,339
Stop lying to her that you are Auntie Peng.

568
00:38:36,160 --> 00:38:38,139
Mind your own business.

569
00:38:38,139 --> 00:38:41,959
Let's talk about it after there is some progress in your relationship.

570
00:38:45,619 --> 00:38:50,599
By the way, how are you going to pretend to be her boyfriend tomorrow?

571
00:38:50,599 --> 00:38:52,459
Just go with the flow.

572
00:38:52,459 --> 00:38:54,860
No. You can't take it casually.

573
00:38:54,860 --> 00:38:57,219
Tomorrow is a great opportunity!

574
00:38:57,219 --> 00:38:58,419
Opportunity.

575
00:38:58,419 --> 00:39:03,039
Lu Zhaoxi slammed the wine glass at dinner, clashing with the crown for the beauty!

576
00:39:03,039 --> 00:39:04,740
What does that mean?

577
00:39:04,740 --> 00:39:06,760
It means...

578
00:39:06,760 --> 00:39:11,240
It means he is a good leader with integrity and courage.

579
00:39:13,299 --> 00:39:15,660
It means he felt anxious.

580
00:39:15,660 --> 00:39:17,980
He felt anxious for you.

581
00:39:17,980 --> 00:39:19,239
Just think about it.

582
00:39:19,239 --> 00:39:22,399
Why does he like to joke with you so much?

583
00:39:23,020 --> 00:39:25,660
That's merely his personality.

584
00:39:25,660 --> 00:39:28,400
Then, why do you like to joke with him?

585
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:30,098
I don't want to sit on my hands.

586
00:39:30,098 --> 00:39:33,179
You are unconsciously influenced by him.

587
00:39:33,179 --> 00:39:37,520
What's more, were you sick of his jokes?

588
00:39:38,779 --> 00:39:41,760
Then in your mind, is he an interesting man?

589
00:39:41,760 --> 00:39:44,020
Interesting?

590
00:39:44,900 --> 00:39:47,680
Maybe...

591
00:39:47,680 --> 00:39:51,520
But he's quite annoying sometimes.

592
00:39:52,840 --> 00:39:56,440
Is it like, "You're so annoying."

593
00:39:56,440 --> 00:39:58,080
Exaggerated.

594
00:39:58,080 --> 00:40:02,038
Yezi, I guarantee with the amount of novels in my collection

595
00:40:02,038 --> 00:40:05,220
that you are wandering on the edge of love.

596
00:40:05,220 --> 00:40:09,720
There aren't many novels in your collection.

597
00:40:09,720 --> 00:40:11,639
That's why they're precious.

598
00:40:11,639 --> 00:40:14,538
You have to seize this opportunity tomorrow.

599
00:40:14,538 --> 00:40:16,999
Observe Lu Zhaoxi carefully,

600
00:40:16,999 --> 00:40:20,760
and look deep into your heart.

601
00:40:20,760 --> 00:40:23,839
I'm going to deceive my mom with Lu Zhaoxi tomorrow.

602
00:40:23,839 --> 00:40:25,459
I need to stay alert

603
00:40:25,459 --> 00:40:27,979
and keep myself in a state of acting throughout the dinner.

604
00:40:27,979 --> 00:40:30,420
How can I be in the mood to observe him?

605
00:40:30,420 --> 00:40:32,960
Immersing yourself into the character is a different experience.

606
00:40:32,960 --> 00:40:35,499
You'll be fine. After a few more times, you will get used to it.

607
00:40:35,499 --> 00:40:36,639
A few more times?

608
00:40:36,639 --> 00:40:38,298
Now that he knows your mom,

609
00:40:38,298 --> 00:40:39,906
it is inevitable that they going to talk via WeChat,

610
00:40:39,906 --> 00:40:41,678
video chat, and do something else in the future.

611
00:40:41,678 --> 00:40:45,060
You have to continue your public display of affection in front of your mom.
