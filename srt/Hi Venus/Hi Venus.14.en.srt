Auntie, clean the glass of the shower room with white vinegar. It will be cleaner.

17
00:01:43,859 --> 00:01:47,490
Okay. Miss Shilan, you know about this?

18
00:01:47,490 --> 00:01:51,119
Just a bit. I'm almost 30 years old.

19
00:01:51,119 --> 00:01:54,219
I thought you'd just graduated from college.

20
00:01:54,219 --> 00:01:56,180
Thanks, Auntie.

21
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:04,559
Slow down. Is it heavy?

22
00:02:04,559 --> 00:02:06,640
- Here you come.
- Good afternoon, Ye.

23
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:07,930
Good afternoon.

24
00:02:07,930 --> 00:02:09,739
This is Qiao Yu, Xixi's friend.

25
00:02:09,739 --> 00:02:11,280
We met in the hospital.

26
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:14,838
- Yes, I forgot you once went to Xixi's office.
- Yes.

27

- Let me help you.
- Okay. Thank you.

You're welcome.

29
00:02:18,819 --> 00:02:21,439
In the past, when I was busy, nothing happened.

30
00:02:21,439 --> 00:02:25,340
Now, when I'm free, I feel uncomfortable all over and my memory is not good.

31
00:02:25,340 --> 00:02:27,878
Really? Have you seen a doctor?

32
00:02:27,878 --> 00:02:31,218
Yes. Nothing is wrong.

33
00:02:31,218 --> 00:02:34,279
You may have wasted your body when you were too busy.

34
00:02:34,279 --> 00:02:36,200
Shall we do yoga together?

35
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:37,450
Yoga? Great!

36
00:02:37,450 --> 00:02:39,870
I've always wanted to do it but I could never make up my mind.

37
00:02:39,878 --> 00:02:42,550
Great. I'll ask you out next time.

38
00:02:42,550 --> 00:02:44,450
Okay.

39
00:02:44,458 --> 00:02:49,039
Ye, do you have any favorite sports?

40
00:02:49,039 --> 00:02:51,719
I seldom exercise.

41
00:02:51,719 --> 00:02:54,620
You're too quiet. Xixi and Qiao Yu are restless.

42
00:02:54,620 --> 00:02:57,659
Yes. When we were in college, we used to go for night runs together.

43
00:02:57,659 --> 00:02:59,900
We're both the energetic types.

44
00:02:59,900 --> 00:03:02,200
I remember you ran every day.

45
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:03,659
I'll wash the vegetables.

46
00:03:03,659 --> 00:03:05,820
Dr. Ye, l can do that. Go on with your work.

47
00:03:05,820 --> 00:03:08,659
Okay. Then I'll go get the president's dry cleaning back.

- Okay, thank you.
- Not at all.

- Yes.

Speak. What advice do you have?

00:05:29,739 --> 00:05:31,540
I read those comments carefully.

73
00:05:31,540 --> 00:05:35,879
There are indeed many scolding you for revising the story, saying you whitewashed the villains.

74
00:05:35,879 --> 00:05:39,959
Sorry. But I think most of them are groundless.

75
00:05:40,780 --> 00:05:43,299
Do you think the comment section is a place to be reasonable?

76
00:05:43,299 --> 00:05:44,759
So, you don't have to worry too much.

77
00:05:44,760 --> 00:05:47,859
Of course. It's not you being scolded.

78
00:05:50,620 --> 00:05:54,220
There are still a lot of compliments on you, seriously saying that you have improved well.

79
00:05:54,220 --> 00:05:55,558
I didn't see them.

80
00:05:55,559 --> 00:05:58,920
Four comments. You can find them.

81
00:05:59,540 --> 00:06:02,359
It's been really hard for you to find a needle in a haystack.

82
00:06:02,359 --> 00:06:05,659
Are you apologizing or asking for credit?

83
00:06:05,659 --> 00:06:07,320
Apologizing.

84
00:06:09,079 --> 00:06:11,818
I see. I don't accept.

85
00:06:12,759 --> 00:06:15,198
Anything else? It's time to go home.

86
00:06:15,198 --> 00:06:16,920

<i>[My Tough President]

You want me to revise it again?

89
00:06:29,099 --> 00:06:31,620
No. Just for reference.

90
00:06:31,620 --> 00:06:35,098
I found you said in the preface that you really wanted to write the business parts well.

91
00:06:35,098 --> 00:06:37,500
But because of your lack of workplace experience in large companies,

92
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:40,599
many things are not clear, and it is always daunting for you to write.

93
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:43,080
I summarized some common sense mistakes.

94
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:45,639
There are also some specific plots of the workplace and business wars.

95
00:06:45,639 --> 00:06:48,420
In fact, you can change them to something more realistic.

96
00:06:48,420 --> 00:06:50,540
Confrontation can last several more rounds.

97
00:06:50,540 --> 00:06:55,559
President's strategies and solutions to the incidents can be more diversified.

98

Jiajia, you're still here?

99
00:07:01,580 --> 00:07:05,118
I'm talking to my friend. I'll leave now.

Bye-bye.

102
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:36,920
Why didn't you tell me earlier you liked Ye?

103
00:07:37,380 --> 00:07:39,899
I just realized it.

104
00:07:40,299 --> 00:07:43,040
I must say that the two of you must be having fun.

105
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:45,700
You treat her quite differently.

106
00:07:46,060 --> 00:07:47,590
What's different?

107
00:07:47,590 --> 00:07:53,399
Assistant Lin told me that you smashed a wine glass for her sake.

108
00:07:53,399 --> 00:07:55,780
I did it because of work.

109
00:07:55,780 --> 00:07:59,640
I've never seen you so irrational about your work.

110
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:03,040
Yes.

111
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:06,159
Also,

112
00:08:06,159 --> 00:08:11,279
you two go to work and stay together every day. After work, you still have to go shopping and eat together.

113
00:08:11,279 --> 00:08:13,100
You don't feel bored at all.

114
00:08:13,100 --> 00:08:18,139
Because I pretended to be her boyfriend, we found it interesting to joke around.

115
00:08:18,139 --> 00:08:21,360
It's a little more time to get along.

116
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:24,100
She asked you to pretend to be a boyfriend for a day,

117
00:08:24,100 --> 00:08:26,640
but you got stuck.

118
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:28,120
You misunderstand me.

119
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:30,759
I didn't want to let her mother down.

120
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:34,940
Obviously, you wanted to be her boyfriend in your heart.

121
00:08:37,699 --> 00:08:39,159
Fine.

122
00:08:39,159 --> 00:08:42,559
Anyway, it is subjective now.

123
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:51,799
Well, was Qiao Yu here this afternoon?

124
00:08:52,839 --> 00:08:57,559
We planned to have dinner, but she suddenly had something to do and left.

125
00:08:57,559 --> 00:09:01,120
Was anything wrong with Ye Shilan when she saw Qiao Yu?

126
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:04,360
No. I didn't notice.

127
00:09:22,699 --> 00:09:24,940
Why are you jumping rope?

128
00:09:24,940 --> 00:09:26,320
Was I noisy?

129
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:29,259
No. What's wrong?

130
00:09:29,259 --> 00:09:31,100
I'm exercising.

131
00:09:31,100 --> 00:09:32,860
Then take a bath and sleep well.

132
00:09:32,860 --> 00:09:34,480
You can't sleep well?

133
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:36,599
A bit.

134
00:09:36,599 --> 00:09:41,160
We bought this rope on impulse two years ago, didn't we?

135
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:42,780
Yes.

136
00:09:42,780 --> 00:09:44,900
We lacked exercise.

137
00:09:44,900 --> 00:09:46,880
We had to get stronger

138
00:09:47,579 --> 00:09:51,398
Sounds good. You go on, I'll take a bath.

139
00:09:52,139 --> 00:09:53,419
<i>Wait a minute.</i>

140
00:09:53,419 --> 00:09:55,900
<i>There's a girl at high school...</i>

141
00:09:55,900 --> 00:09:57,719
<i>Who?</i>

142
00:10:10,980 --> 00:10:13,039
Exhausted.

143
00:10:28,159 --> 00:10:33,219
I think you should express your love to Ye Shilan directly.

144
00:10:34,680 --> 00:10:37,039
What if she dislikes me?

145
00:10:37,039 --> 00:10:40,660
You're afraid of losing face by being rejected?

146
00:10:40,660 --> 00:10:45,560
I am worried that it'll be difficult for her to face me after refusing my love,

147
00:10:45,560 --> 00:10:48,039
causing bad trouble for her.

148
00:10:48,039 --> 00:10:50,860
So you really like her.

149
00:10:52,619 --> 00:10:55,719
Ye Shilan indeed taught me a lesson.

150
00:10:59,379 --> 00:11:00,739
Think it over.

151
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:04,460
The boss and employee or boss and subordinate,

152
00:11:04,460 --> 00:11:08,300
no matter how good the relationship is usually or how casual the former is,

153
00:11:08,319 --> 00:11:11,760
the two people are always unequal in mentality.

154
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:18,639
For example, a toast to the boss does not mean that the employee is completely voluntary.

155
00:11:18,639 --> 00:11:21,540
Some people consciously compromise,

156
00:11:21,540 --> 00:11:26,430
but some people unconsciously obey the stronger side.

157
00:11:27,619 --> 00:11:32,978
In work, someone needs to post a task, make decisions, and take risks.

158
00:11:32,978 --> 00:11:36,980
We need this kind of unequal relationship to carry out plans.

159
00:11:36,980 --> 00:11:39,339
Yes. It is normal at work,

160
00:11:39,339 --> 00:11:42,858
but the restrictive relationship makes it hard to erase inequality

161
00:11:42,858 --> 00:11:46,500
and it is likely to radiate to places outside of work.

162
00:11:47,059 --> 00:11:48,980
I understand your concerns.

163
00:11:48,980 --> 00:11:54,839
You are worried that the answer given by Ye Shilan cannot completely follow her heart.

164
00:11:58,259 --> 00:12:01,780
Ye Shilan really worries a lot.

165
00:12:01,780 --> 00:12:03,579
What should you do?

166
00:12:03,579 --> 00:12:06,259
Will you wait for her to take the initiative?

167
00:12:06,259 --> 00:12:08,280
Of course not.

168
00:12:08,819 --> 00:12:14,299
No matter what she thinks, there will be traces left, which will show up soon.

169
00:12:17,059 --> 00:12:18,359
Come on.

170
00:12:19,100 --> 00:12:20,939
Wish you success.

171
00:12:27,499 --> 00:12:31,140
Kevin knows a lot.

172
00:12:31,140 --> 00:12:34,099
Good thoughts. Interesting.

173
00:12:36,300 --> 00:12:38,279
Come in, baby.

174
00:12:42,139 --> 00:12:44,180
What's wrong?

175
00:12:44,180 --> 00:12:46,059
I'm upset.

176
00:12:47,579 --> 00:12:51,120
Let's apply a facial mask and have a chat.

177
00:12:59,019 --> 00:13:02,180
Are you jealous?

178
00:13:03,139 --> 00:13:04,900
I don't know.

179
00:13:05,699 --> 00:13:09,380
In principle, I should bless him.

180
00:13:09,380 --> 00:13:15,239
But why am I unhappy when I see Qiao Yu having fun with his mother?

181
00:13:15,239 --> 00:13:17,619
I'd think you'd have figured it out.

182
00:13:17,619 --> 00:13:20,459
You like Lu Zhaoxi in your heart.

183
00:13:21,220 --> 00:13:22,220
No way.

184
00:13:22,220 --> 00:13:24,100
Why not?

185
00:13:24,100 --> 00:13:28,919
I told you that my feelings about him

186
00:13:28,919 --> 00:13:30,999
are intermittent.

187
00:13:30,999 --> 00:13:33,760
Intermittent?

188
00:13:34,819 --> 00:13:38,499
Do you feel inferior in front of him?

189
00:13:38,499 --> 00:13:40,970
Inferior?

190
00:13:41,860 --> 00:13:44,819
Do you think you don't deserve him?

191
00:13:44,819 --> 00:13:46,200
I really don't deserve him.

192
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:48,639
That's your subconscious.

193
00:13:48,639 --> 00:13:49,900
What do you mean?

194
00:13:49,900 --> 00:13:51,740
You obviously have feelings for him.

195
00:13:51,740 --> 00:13:55,498
But you think you aren't a good match and believe that he won't like you,

196
00:13:55,498 --> 00:13:57,660
so you dare not magnify this feeling,

197
00:13:57,660 --> 00:14:02,310
and even constantly persuade yourself to hide it.

198
00:14:02,318 --> 00:14:03,450
Think carefully.

199
00:14:03,450 --> 00:14:05,730
When you pretend to be lovers together,

200
00:14:05,730 --> 00:14:10,150
are you relaxed, natural, and enjoyable?

201
00:14:10,159 --> 00:14:14,640
In fact, this is wearing a mask to show your true self.

202
00:14:15,860 --> 00:14:17,939
True self?

203
00:14:29,660 --> 00:14:33,858
<i>After working all day, a boyfriend waits for me to have dinner and shop.</i>

204
00:14:33,858 --> 00:14:37,320

<i>Of course not.</i>

00:14:59,259 --> 00:15:00,540

211
00:15:00,540 --> 00:15:02,700

Come in.

00:16:36,699 --> 00:16:38,880
President, your courier express.

228
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:40,179
Okay.

229
00:16:42,100 --> 00:16:43,580
What's this?

230
00:16:43,580 --> 00:16:47,260
Since you're interested, I sorted out the data.

231
00:16:47,260 --> 00:16:50,080
Are you sure I'm interested in these?

232
00:16:50,080 --> 00:16:51,740
Are you not?

233
00:16:53,340 --> 00:16:55,049
Give it to me. I'll throw it away.

234
00:16:55,049 --> 00:16:56,619
Never mind.

235
00:16:56,619 --> 00:16:58,619
I should respect the fruit of you labor.

236
00:16:58,619 --> 00:17:00,459
Let me see.

237
00:17:02,740 --> 00:17:04,400
I'll go back to Pediatrics.

238
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:07,660
You may not be satisfied with what the former assistant prepared.

239
00:17:07,660 --> 00:17:11,019
Just tell her what flowers you want.

240
00:17:12,259 --> 00:17:15,180
Then do you think what you prepared is in line with my wishes?

241
00:17:15,180 --> 00:17:16,940
At least you didn't object.

242
00:17:16,940 --> 00:17:20,580
I won't object to any flowers you buy.

243
00:17:26,300 --> 00:17:27,880
President,

244
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:30,979
you are really an inclusive president.

245
00:17:36,379 --> 00:17:38,099
Ye Shilan,

246
00:17:38,099 --> 00:17:41,700
you should improve your understanding.

247
00:17:44,580 --> 00:17:46,099
Practice driving tomorrow.

248
00:17:46,099 --> 00:17:47,300
Practice driving?

249
00:17:47,300 --> 00:17:49,800
What? Aren't you free?

250
00:17:49,800 --> 00:17:51,619
No, I listen to you.

251
00:17:51,619 --> 00:17:53,680
Besides, buy a bunch of sunflowers.

252
00:17:53,680 --> 00:17:55,840
Sunflowers?

253
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:56,719
Okay.

254
00:17:56,720 --> 00:17:58,580
What do they symbolize?

255
00:17:59,180 --> 00:18:02,979
Faith, loyalty, and silent love.

256
00:18:02,979 --> 00:18:04,780
It should be.

257
00:18:05,580 --> 00:18:07,060
I just had a look.

258
00:18:07,060 --> 00:18:09,919
It seems that all flowers are related to love.

259
00:18:09,920 --> 00:18:12,239
You never mentioned them before.

260
00:18:13,060 --> 00:18:15,580
These moral meanings are given by people.

261
00:18:15,580 --> 00:18:18,420
Which one you want depends on what you think.

262
00:18:18,420 --> 00:18:22,619
The rose symbolizing love was not named until 1784.

263
00:18:22,619 --> 00:18:24,800
Love appeared much earlier.

264
00:18:25,420 --> 00:18:27,060
Sounds good.

265
00:18:28,420 --> 00:18:32,739
Then I will choose silent love.

266
00:18:40,810 --> 00:18:42,899
- President Lu, are you free?
- What's the matter?

267
00:18:42,899 --> 00:18:47,139
I have a meeting with endoscopic doctors. Could you show up?

268
00:18:49,139 --> 00:18:50,360
Okay.

269
00:18:50,360 --> 00:18:52,019
Now?

270
00:18:52,019 --> 00:18:53,380
Go.

271
00:18:53,380 --> 00:18:54,979
By the way,

272
00:18:54,979 --> 00:18:57,940
will you have lunch with us?

273
00:18:57,940 --> 00:19:00,699
No, thanks. You go.

274
00:19:01,540 --> 00:19:02,879
Let's go.

275
00:19:47,060 --> 00:19:49,340
How aboveboard you are!

276
00:19:49,340 --> 00:19:51,619
Silent love?

277
00:20:01,820 --> 00:20:03,499
Okay, thank you.

278
00:20:18,460 --> 00:20:20,540
I packed the noodles.

279
00:20:20,540 --> 00:20:22,519
Can I sit here for a while?

280
00:20:22,519 --> 00:20:24,160
Whatever.

281
00:20:37,060 --> 00:20:42,660
Well... Have you heard the rumors among the colleagues?

282
00:20:42,660 --> 00:20:45,540
Yes. Confession was refused.

283
00:20:45,540 --> 00:20:47,180
I didn't say that.

284
00:20:47,180 --> 00:20:49,300
But you heard that.

285
00:20:50,859 --> 00:20:52,520
Yes.

286
00:20:52,520 --> 00:20:56,460
So I come to apologize for not explaining it clearly.

287
00:20:59,540 --> 00:21:01,700
You're always like this.

288
00:21:01,700 --> 00:21:04,619
Out of work, you muddle along.

289
00:21:07,780 --> 00:21:09,080
Yes.

290
00:21:09,080 --> 00:21:11,680
My character is defective.

291
00:21:13,180 --> 00:21:15,739
I didn't say it was a defect.

292
00:21:16,310 --> 00:21:19,180
If being different from others is a defect,

293
00:21:19,180 --> 00:21:22,090
my character is full of defects.

294
00:21:23,099 --> 00:21:24,400
Yes.

295
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:27,398
Not a defect. We're different.

296
00:21:29,560 --> 00:21:31,940
Why not eat here?

297
00:21:31,940 --> 00:21:34,060
I bought it for Zhining.

298
00:21:35,960 --> 00:21:38,120
I've eaten.

299
00:21:38,120 --> 00:21:42,199
After the meeting, the president invited us to have lunch.

300
00:21:44,520 --> 00:21:46,660
I thought they were eating together.

301
00:21:46,660 --> 00:21:49,739
You mean President and Qiao Yu?

302
00:21:54,790 --> 00:21:58,830
Dr. Zeng told me Deputy Director Qiao is the president's ex-girlfriend.

303
00:21:58,830 --> 00:22:00,270
Really?

304
00:22:00,979 --> 00:22:05,399
Yes. But it's been a long time since they broke up.

305
00:22:06,900 --> 00:22:10,760
It's rare to get on well with an ex-girlfriend.

306
00:22:11,899 --> 00:22:16,239
No. I have no other meanings. Let's be just colleagues.

307
00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:26,000
Seeing that they have such a good relationship, there should be a chance to get back together again.

Just so-so.

317
00:23:38,339 --> 00:23:41,778
Well. Are you afraid of bumping it?

318

Don't worry. Each part here is priced separately.

319
00:23:49,219 --> 00:23:52,798
In fact, if I don’t work as an assistant in the future, I don’t need to learn to drive.

You'll drive sooner or later.

Anyway, I'm giving you free labor.

I don't dislike it.

324
00:24:00,779 --> 00:24:04,319
I'm afraid to waste your time.

00:24:13,540 --> 00:24:15,800
having a date with Qiao Yu.

328
00:24:17,259 --> 00:24:20,558
We work together all day long. Weekends don't matter.

329
00:24:20,558 --> 00:24:24,699
Who hates spending too much time with their loved one?

330
00:24:25,580 --> 00:24:29,759
You're right. But I promised you to practice driving.

331
00:24:29,759 --> 00:24:32,219
I can't leave you behind.

332
00:24:35,260 --> 00:24:41,280
According to you, is today work time or personal time?

333
00:24:42,859 --> 00:24:47,699
President, if I was wrong that day, just forget it.

334
00:24:47,699 --> 00:24:49,640
You're right.

335
00:24:51,619 --> 00:24:54,940
What do you think?

336
00:24:56,300 --> 00:24:57,438
Listen to me.

337
00:24:57,439 --> 00:24:59,079
Listen to you?

338
00:25:00,979 --> 00:25:02,959
Personal time.

339
00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:12,379
To differentiate it, call me by my name.

340
00:25:12,379 --> 00:25:13,799
Is it okay?

341
00:25:13,799 --> 00:25:17,279
Look. You just can't do it.

342
00:25:21,460 --> 00:25:23,079
Lu...

343
00:25:26,080 --> 00:25:27,660
President.

344
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:30,918
Is my name poisonous?

345
00:25:30,918 --> 00:25:34,119
I remember you often called me by my name in Taoyuan Village.

346
00:25:34,119 --> 00:25:36,430
And on the evening of the dinner party,

347
00:25:36,430 --> 00:25:39,790
you directly criticized me for not understanding you.

348
00:25:40,339 --> 00:25:42,120
Are you still afraid of me?

349
00:25:42,120 --> 00:25:43,920
No.

350
00:25:45,180 --> 00:25:48,199
Lu Zhaoxi.

351
00:26:04,219 --> 00:26:07,598
There are no people or cars on this road. Practice here.

352
00:26:07,598 --> 00:26:09,099
Do you remember the basics?

353
00:26:09,099 --> 00:26:09,879
Yes.

354
00:26:09,879 --> 00:26:12,719
Okay, get out of the car.

355
00:26:43,130 --> 00:26:44,519
Why are you laughing?

356
00:26:44,519 --> 00:26:47,360
No. Great.

357
00:26:51,639 --> 00:26:54,459
1. Place foot. 2. Push on pedal. 3. Put in gear

358
00:26:54,459 --> 00:26:57,260
4. Signal. 5. Relax.

359
00:26:57,260 --> 00:26:58,920
6. Observe.

360
00:26:58,920 --> 00:27:02,438
7. Lift pedal. 8. Step on gas pedal. 9. Turn on the blinker.

361
00:27:03,259 --> 00:27:06,680
Yes. But you forgot one step.

362
00:27:06,680 --> 00:27:08,539
What?

363
00:27:08,539 --> 00:27:10,960
Can you brake?

364
00:27:13,700 --> 00:27:16,079
I forgot to adjust my seat.

365
00:27:18,360 --> 00:27:19,479
Where's this button?

366
00:27:19,479 --> 00:27:21,520
On your left.

367
00:27:27,320 --> 00:27:32,240
♫ <i>You are a part of my life</i> ♫

368
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:34,420
♫ <i>You're my shining armor</i> ♫

369
00:27:34,420 --> 00:27:37,339
Look to see if it's suitable or not.

370
00:27:38,239 --> 00:27:39,940
It is.

371
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:44,100
Okay. Done.

372
00:27:44,100 --> 00:27:49,518
♫ <i>The dream makes it come true</i> ♫

373
00:27:49,518 --> 00:27:52,459
Take it easy. I'm here.

374
00:28:10,759 --> 00:28:14,769
The brake can be fully released. You can add some gas.

375
00:28:15,739 --> 00:28:17,759
I think I'm driving fast enough.

376
00:28:17,759 --> 00:28:21,020
Yes, it's a little faster than walking.

377
00:28:25,759 --> 00:28:29,639
Relax your hands. You don't have to turn the steering wheel much.

378
00:28:29,639 --> 00:28:32,070
A small correction will do.

379
00:28:38,300 --> 00:28:41,638
Good job. You're gifted.

380
00:28:41,638 --> 00:28:44,839
You still remember the basics from school.

381
00:28:44,839 --> 00:28:48,760
In fact, I've been secretly reviewing these two days.

382
00:28:49,999 --> 00:28:52,060
Turn around and drive back.

383
00:28:52,060 --> 00:28:53,860
Okay.

384
00:29:00,279 --> 00:29:02,119
Welcome!

385
00:29:02,119 --> 00:29:04,140
Your friend came.

386
00:29:07,139 --> 00:29:09,119
Welcome!

387
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:13,479
Old rule.

388
00:29:14,919 --> 00:29:17,079
How long will you stay?

389
00:29:17,079 --> 00:29:18,519
Till this evening.

390
00:29:18,519 --> 00:29:20,840
Could I ask you any questions later?

391
00:29:20,840 --> 00:29:22,460
Sure.

392
00:29:28,440 --> 00:29:30,339
My treat.

393
00:29:31,119 --> 00:29:32,920
Thanks.

394
00:30:03,639 --> 00:30:05,519
Hello.

395
00:30:08,159 --> 00:30:11,060
I passed my driving test once and for all.

396
00:30:11,060 --> 00:30:14,660
It seems that it's not just luck.

397
00:30:16,200 --> 00:30:19,939
Steady. Like an old driver.

398
00:30:22,379 --> 00:30:26,618
You can turn right ahead. Not many cars on that road.

399
00:30:26,618 --> 00:30:28,380
Okay.

400
00:30:32,300 --> 00:30:34,200
<i>[Assistant Lin]</i>

401
00:30:34,200 --> 00:30:35,780
Hello. What's up?

402
00:30:35,780 --> 00:30:38,540
<i>President, the police just called</i>

403
00:30:38,540 --> 00:30:41,160
<i>and said that the man who stole the necklace was caught.</i>

404
00:30:44,700 --> 00:30:46,859
Concentrate on driving.

405
00:30:46,859 --> 00:30:48,680
<i>What are you saying?</i>

406
00:30:54,159 --> 00:30:56,640
Okay. Got it.

407
00:31:25,820 --> 00:31:28,778
Have some water. Calm down.

408
00:31:28,778 --> 00:31:32,379
Not thirsty. I'm not angry.

409
00:31:43,859 --> 00:31:45,959
Really?

410
00:31:46,900 --> 00:31:50,860
President, you don't have to lie to me.

411
00:31:50,860 --> 00:31:52,579
I'm an adult.

412
00:31:52,579 --> 00:31:55,439
I need to be responsible for what I do.

413
00:31:55,439 --> 00:31:59,160
I know. But you were in a hurry to save people, so I...

414
00:31:59,160 --> 00:32:02,039
But that was my choice.

415
00:32:06,239 --> 00:32:10,459
If it were someone else, maybe they would still be grateful to me.

416
00:32:10,459 --> 00:32:14,180
But you are Ye Shilan. You rely on yourself.

417
00:32:14,180 --> 00:32:17,560
I lost the necklace due to my negligence.

418
00:32:17,560 --> 00:32:20,738
It's my fault. Understand?

419
00:32:22,080 --> 00:32:23,839
Got it.

420
00:32:25,119 --> 00:32:29,500
President, I'm not angry at all.

421
00:32:29,500 --> 00:32:32,020
I'm just a bit upset.

422
00:32:36,660 --> 00:32:38,640
Call me Lu Zhaoxi.

423
00:32:39,940 --> 00:32:41,920
Lu Zhaoxi.

424
00:32:43,919 --> 00:32:49,359
Lu Zhaoxi. You are so ungracious.

425
00:32:49,359 --> 00:32:51,079
Don't blame yourself.

426
00:32:51,079 --> 00:32:55,459
You just heard the police say they solved the problem,

427
00:32:55,459 --> 00:32:57,640
and nothing was delayed.

428
00:32:59,139 --> 00:33:03,359
Sorry. I was a little excited just now.

429
00:33:04,159 --> 00:33:08,959
That's it. I wanted to help you solve the problem. But you blame me.

430
00:33:08,959 --> 00:33:11,100
I don't.

431
00:33:11,100 --> 00:33:15,078
I'm an adult. I need to be responsible for what I do.

432
00:33:18,580 --> 00:33:23,519
Well. Since I brought you out, shouldn't you invite me to have dinner?

433
00:33:23,519 --> 00:33:27,199
A meal isn't enough. What about ten?

434
00:33:27,199 --> 00:33:28,880
President Ye is aggressive!

435
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:30,839
Call me Ye Shilan.

436
00:33:31,660 --> 00:33:32,979
Childish.

437
00:33:32,979 --> 00:33:36,560
Ye Shilan, anything for dinner?

438
00:33:36,560 --> 00:33:38,839
Have you decided?

439
00:33:38,839 --> 00:33:42,680
I want to eat your cooking.

440
00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:44,559
My home?

441
00:33:44,559 --> 00:33:45,659
Okay.

442
00:33:45,659 --> 00:33:48,659
Okay, let's go. To my home.

443
00:33:53,420 --> 00:33:55,880
Drive me on the way back.

444
00:33:55,880 --> 00:33:57,519
Dare you let me do it?

445
00:33:57,519 --> 00:34:00,739
I've observed. You can do it.

446
00:34:00,739 --> 00:34:01,959
Or you dare not?

447
00:34:01,959 --> 00:34:03,559
Of course not.

448
00:34:03,559 --> 00:34:06,119
I think driving is interesting.

449
00:34:06,119 --> 00:34:08,539
Most beginners are addicted.

450
00:34:13,199 --> 00:34:17,970
At that time, we started to practice reverse parking and did well.

451
00:34:17,970 --> 00:34:20,660
Suddenly one day, coaches took away the fire extinguishers.

452
00:34:20,660 --> 00:34:22,850
We were all confused.

453
00:34:22,859 --> 00:34:25,240
I took Subject Two twice.

454
00:34:25,240 --> 00:34:26,699
Really?

455
00:34:26,699 --> 00:34:29,579
I thought you were good at everything.

456
00:34:30,220 --> 00:34:31,839
No men's slippers at home.

457
00:34:31,839 --> 00:34:34,259
My friend took them from a hotel. Try them.

458
00:34:34,259 --> 00:34:35,719
Okay.

459
00:34:35,719 --> 00:34:38,679
Take a seat. I'll serve you some water.

460
00:34:42,519 --> 00:34:44,600
Isn't my home small?

461
00:34:44,600 --> 00:34:47,759
No. It's full of vitality.

462
00:34:48,640 --> 00:34:50,379
To kill time.

463
00:34:50,379 --> 00:34:52,038
You like to read these?

464
00:34:52,038 --> 00:34:53,799
It's my hobby.

465
00:34:53,799 --> 00:34:56,378
Go to the furniture store with me when you are free.

466
00:34:56,378 --> 00:34:58,100
Okay.

467
00:34:58,100 --> 00:35:00,638
Sit here. I'll cook.

468
00:35:00,638 --> 00:35:02,138
Let me help you.

469
00:35:02,138 --> 00:35:03,300
No, thanks.

470
00:35:03,300 --> 00:35:06,240
There are some simple dishes in the refrigerator.

471
00:35:06,240 --> 00:35:09,138
My mother sent me handmade sausage. Do you want some?

472
00:35:09,138 --> 00:35:11,040
Okay.

473
00:35:11,040 --> 00:35:14,260
My mom asked me to give some to your parents.

474
00:35:14,260 --> 00:35:16,560
Why to my parents?

475
00:35:21,020 --> 00:35:22,960
Boyfriend's parents.

476
00:35:23,620 --> 00:35:25,660
I'll cook first.

477
00:36:18,619 --> 00:36:21,360
Kevin, let's make up.

478
00:36:23,800 --> 00:36:27,338
The revision incident is over. I forgive you.

479
00:36:35,020 --> 00:36:39,059
No offense. What's your job?

480
00:36:39,059 --> 00:36:41,380
President's assistant.

481
00:36:41,380 --> 00:36:43,039
Army adviser.

482
00:36:43,039 --> 00:36:45,379
That's how you understand it?

483
00:36:45,379 --> 00:36:46,859
Is it wrong?

484
00:36:46,859 --> 00:36:49,220
Everyone is different.

485
00:36:49,220 --> 00:36:52,179
I learned a lot from the information you gave me.

486
00:36:52,179 --> 00:36:55,499
You must have executive experience.

487
00:36:55,499 --> 00:36:57,920
It's good that it helps you.

488
00:36:57,920 --> 00:37:00,180
I learned a lot.

489
00:37:01,260 --> 00:37:03,500
Could I add your WeChat?

490
00:37:03,500 --> 00:37:06,570
May I ask you questions later?

491
00:37:08,099 --> 00:37:10,239
I know it's a little abrupt.

492
00:37:10,239 --> 00:37:13,579
Don't worry. I won't delay you too much.

493
00:37:13,579 --> 00:37:16,939
By the way, if you come to have a strawberry smoothie,

494
00:37:16,939 --> 00:37:20,739
I can offer 50% discount.

495
00:37:22,260 --> 00:37:24,719
My consultant fee is expensive.

496
00:37:26,180 --> 00:37:29,539
I can't afford more.

497
00:37:29,539 --> 00:37:33,079
How much did you spend? I should return it to you.

498
00:37:33,079 --> 00:37:37,659
It doesn't matter if you don't add me.

499
00:37:43,619 --> 00:37:45,759
Don't you want to add me?

500
00:37:45,759 --> 00:37:47,679
Yes.

501
00:37:47,679 --> 00:37:49,399
Come on.

502
00:37:53,980 --> 00:37:55,790
Just buy me a smoothie.

503
00:37:55,790 --> 00:37:58,860
Your article doesn't have many subscriptions.

504
00:37:58,860 --> 00:38:02,938
Yes. So I have to work in a cafe to support myself.

505

<i>[Coffee Girl] [Doghead Soldier]</i>

506
00:38:20,920 --> 00:38:23,119
I'd better invite you to have lunch.

507
00:38:23,119 --> 00:38:25,760
Or I dare not ask you questions.

508
00:38:26,779 --> 00:38:28,460
Okay.

509
00:38:33,020 --> 00:38:36,539
They're not casual dishes at all. You can open a restaurant.

510
00:38:36,539 --> 00:38:38,838
Stop it. How much can you eat?

511
00:38:38,838 --> 00:38:40,099
I'll take away leftovers.

512
00:38:40,099 --> 00:38:42,100
Daydreaming.

513
00:38:43,040 --> 00:38:44,539
Have a taste.

514
00:38:45,500 --> 00:38:49,139
The sausage smells good. It's really an appetizer.

515
00:38:49,139 --> 00:38:53,038
Well. We haven't drunk Li's medicinal liquor. Do you want some?

516
00:38:53,038 --> 00:38:54,059
Okay.

517
00:38:54,059 --> 00:38:56,500
No. You have to drive home.

518
00:38:56,500 --> 00:38:58,690
I'll designate a driver.

519
00:38:58,690 --> 00:39:00,640
I'm afraid you won't be able to walk.

520
00:39:00,640 --> 00:39:02,760
I didn't have anything in my stomach last time.

521
00:39:02,760 --> 00:39:04,930
I can still drink.

522
00:39:04,930 --> 00:39:06,730
It's true.

523
00:39:07,619 --> 00:39:10,199
Okay, let me bring it.

524
00:39:11,940 --> 00:39:14,779
Thank you for your meal.

525
00:39:17,660 --> 00:39:18,820
Have a taste.

526
00:39:18,820 --> 00:39:20,879
Let me taste it.

527
00:39:23,900 --> 00:39:25,879
Quite yummy.

528
00:39:25,879 --> 00:39:28,759
This is my mom's credit. Try the chicken.

529
00:39:28,759 --> 00:39:30,299
Okay.

530
00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:40,200
It tastes good.There is a feeling of deja vu.

531
00:39:40,239 --> 00:39:42,400
I once ate a 300-yuan piece.

532
00:39:44,059 --> 00:39:46,720
I thought you were a drug dealer.

533
00:39:46,720 --> 00:39:51,019
When you sat down, you wiped your chopsticks with a tissue.

534
00:39:51,019 --> 00:39:53,660
Then I got angry.

535
00:39:54,239 --> 00:39:56,080
It's my fault.

536
00:39:56,940 --> 00:40:01,739
But when we met again, I found I was the clown.

537
00:40:02,779 --> 00:40:07,498
I find that your temper has cooled down since you came back from Taoyuan Village.

538
00:40:07,498 --> 00:40:09,860
I learned from my mistakes.

539
00:40:09,860 --> 00:40:13,180
It's also a kind of growth.

540
00:40:14,180 --> 00:40:17,520
Sometimes growth is not necessarily right.

541
00:40:18,139 --> 00:40:22,420
It may not be correct, but it may be appropriate.

542
00:40:22,420 --> 00:40:25,619
It is human nature to profit and avoid harm.

543
00:40:25,619 --> 00:40:30,040
Sometimes people choose a more suitable way to survive.

544
00:40:30,740 --> 00:40:34,040
This is also a self-protection mechanism.

545
00:40:35,299 --> 00:40:39,299
Just like a kid from a poor family who is praised as sensible.

546
00:40:39,299 --> 00:40:41,800
Is he sensible in nature?

547
00:40:41,800 --> 00:40:45,720
No. He just thinks that by doing so,

548
00:40:45,720 --> 00:40:48,200
he will get along better with his family

549
00:40:48,200 --> 00:40:51,879
and make his heart feel better.

550
00:40:52,940 --> 00:40:56,040
Your mom said you were sensible when young.

551
00:40:56,660 --> 00:41:00,020
Yes. I was sensible.

552
00:41:00,020 --> 00:41:04,500
But a lack of material is nothing to me.

553
00:41:04,500 --> 00:41:07,599
I remember I was happy

554
00:41:07,599 --> 00:41:09,660
until my father...

555
00:41:13,800 --> 00:41:15,500
died.
