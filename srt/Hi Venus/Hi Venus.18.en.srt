16
00:01:37,139 --> 00:01:38,540
Assistant Ye.

17
00:01:38,540 --> 00:01:41,619
- Morning.
- Morning.

18
00:01:44,139 --> 00:01:47,550
Shall I call you Dr. Ye now?

19
00:01:47,550 --> 00:01:50,130
As you like.

20
00:01:50,130 --> 00:01:52,300
You must be busy recently.

21
00:01:52,300 --> 00:01:56,058
The documentary is about to be filmed. It's all about meetings every day.

22
00:02:00,700 --> 00:02:03,000
President will be here in a while.

23
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:06,380
You two have a good relationship now, right?

24
00:02:07,219 --> 00:02:09,019
Quite good.

25
00:02:10,459 --> 00:02:13,619
Sorry to make a scene before you at the natatorium.

26
00:02:13,619 --> 00:02:17,759
It's not the case. I just saw Lu Zhaoxi's anxiousness.

27
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:24,900
He probably didn't tell you. He was so frustrated after you left that day.

28
00:02:24,900 --> 00:02:27,600
Who made him fool around.

29
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:30,179
Then, don't hate me as the tool man. Okay?

30
00:02:30,179 --> 00:02:31,780
Of course not.

31
00:02:31,780 --> 00:02:36,259
Because of you, we got together faster than expected.

32
00:02:36,259 --> 00:02:38,880
You're also impatient.

33
00:02:40,620 --> 00:02:42,320
Here he is.

34
00:02:50,099 --> 00:02:51,839
- Morning.
- Morning.

35
00:02:51,839 --> 00:02:52,941
What're you talking about?

36
00:02:52,941 --> 00:02:55,064
- Speaking ill of you.
- Speaking ill of you.

37
00:02:57,420 --> 00:02:58,780
Am I late?

38
00:02:58,780 --> 00:03:00,379
No.

39
00:03:00,379 --> 00:03:02,340
Morning, President.

40
00:03:02,900 --> 00:03:05,659
Is everyone here? Let's go.

41
00:03:05,659 --> 00:03:07,160
Get in.

42
00:03:11,539 --> 00:03:14,059
You can sit in the front.

43
00:03:14,059 --> 00:03:15,298
You can sit in front.

44
00:03:15,298 --> 00:03:17,652
Ye Shilan, why are you being so polite?

45
00:03:17,652 --> 00:03:19,651
Sit in the front.

46
00:03:39,379 --> 00:03:44,119
Dr. Ye, I heard you had been to Taoyuan Village for half a year?

47
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:49,479
So President thought I should go as well.

48
00:03:49,479 --> 00:03:53,202
In a mountain village, most patients are the elderly and kids.

49
00:03:53,202 --> 00:03:58,698
So our free clinic team mainly consists of pediatricians and geriatricians.

50
00:03:58,698 --> 00:04:00,998
Will there be many villagers going to the clinic?

51
00:04:00,998 --> 00:04:02,760
There should be quite a lot.

52
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:04,520
They'll be informed in advance.

53
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:06,839
The clinic there will cooperate.

54
00:04:06,839 --> 00:04:11,059
Now they all have rural cooperative medical care, so it won't cost much.

55
00:04:11,059 --> 00:04:14,819
Because we are a free clinic, they are still willing to go and have a look.

56
00:04:14,819 --> 00:04:17,319
Some elderly people don't feel well,

57
00:04:17,319 --> 00:04:20,079
and don’t want to bother their children to take them to the city for medical treatment.

58
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:21,698
They think it's not a big deal.

59
00:04:21,698 --> 00:04:24,298
Now experts have come knocking on their door.

60
00:04:24,298 --> 00:04:27,258
They're willing to try and get examined.

61
00:04:27,258 --> 00:04:31,018
They'll rest assured if nothing goes wrong.

62
00:04:31,018 --> 00:04:34,458
If there's any severe disease, they'll get timely treatment.

63
00:04:34,458 --> 00:04:36,500
This is my first free clinic.

64
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:39,259
Do children have many health problems?

65
00:04:39,259 --> 00:04:42,799
Similar to the cases we had in the hospital,

66
00:04:42,799 --> 00:04:45,638
but some elderly people refuse to see a doctor.

67
00:04:45,638 --> 00:04:49,859
They tend to use folk recipes to treat their children.

68
00:04:49,859 --> 00:04:53,999
Sometimes the wrong recipes may exacerbate the disease.

69
00:04:53,999 --> 00:04:56,758
When dealing with such people, you've to ask them clearly,

70
00:04:56,758 --> 00:05:00,140
and give them more popular knowledge.

71
00:05:00,140 --> 00:05:03,279
What do the folk recipes look like?

72
00:05:03,279 --> 00:05:05,939
It's varied. They have many kinds.

73
00:05:05,939 --> 00:05:10,239
If you're interested, I'll invite the clinic's Director Li to tell you.

74
00:05:10,239 --> 00:05:11,739
Great.

75
00:05:14,579 --> 00:05:17,379
Some even use metaphysics.

76
00:05:17,379 --> 00:05:19,360
What does that mean?

77
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:22,940
A kid had a fishbone stuck in his throat.

78
00:05:22,940 --> 00:05:26,619
His grandpa recited a spell to turn a bowl of clean water

79
00:05:26,619 --> 00:05:28,981
into bone-melting water,

80
00:05:28,981 --> 00:05:30,660
and said it'd be okay on drinking it.

81
00:05:30,660 --> 00:05:32,560
Is that really okay?

82
00:05:33,220 --> 00:05:36,258
He drank several bowls of it, but finally turned to a doctor

83
00:05:36,258 --> 00:05:39,279
who took out the fish bone with tweezers.

84
00:05:39,279 --> 00:05:43,018
I saw this recipe online before.

85
00:05:43,018 --> 00:05:44,799
Quite an old one.

86
00:05:44,799 --> 00:05:47,719
If it's useless, how can it still be carried out till now?

87
00:05:47,719 --> 00:05:49,178
I know the reason.

88
00:05:49,178 --> 00:05:52,858
We don't always get fishbones stuck in our throats.

89
00:05:52,858 --> 00:05:56,059
Our throat hurts because it was cut by the bone.

90
00:05:56,059 --> 00:05:57,840
It's basically self-healing.

91
00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:00,860
It may also be regarded as the effect of the bowl of water.

92
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:01,780
That's it.

93
00:06:01,780 --> 00:06:04,419
If a fishbone really gets stuck in your throat,

94
00:06:04,419 --> 00:06:06,699
go to see a doctor immediately.

95
00:06:06,699 --> 00:06:08,760
Got it.

96
00:06:09,540 --> 00:06:14,220
<i>[Anxing Hospital Free Clinic]</i>

97
00:06:20,559 --> 00:06:22,239
Four.

98
00:06:22,859 --> 00:06:26,220
Xiaoye and the others should be here soon.

99
00:06:26,220 --> 00:06:29,939
She texted Su via WeChat that they set off early this morning.

100
00:06:29,939 --> 00:06:32,659
Director, do you miss Ye?

101
00:06:32,659 --> 00:06:33,940
Don't you miss her?

102
00:06:33,940 --> 00:06:35,480
Yes, I do.

103
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:39,679
It's said she and President Lu brought us many gifts.

104
00:06:40,859 --> 00:06:43,180
Let's all have a day off today.

105
00:06:43,180 --> 00:06:47,039
Leave the consulting room to the pediatricians like Chief Huang and Ye.

106
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:49,178
Isn't he the one who wouldn't deal with Ye?

107
00:06:49,178 --> 00:06:50,699
Yeah.

108
00:06:50,699 --> 00:06:54,320
Ye told me on the phone he's no longer the chief.

109
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:56,059
Though he's not the Chief of Pediatrics,

110
00:06:56,059 --> 00:06:57,721
he's still a chief physician,

111
00:06:57,722 --> 00:07:00,419
so call him Chief Huang as before.

112
00:07:19,122 --> 00:07:20,780
Director. Deputy Director. Morning!

113
00:07:20,780 --> 00:07:22,600
- Morning.
- Hi.

114
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:24,969
You were here late last night setting up.

115
00:07:24,969 --> 00:07:27,498
I told you to get some good rest.

116
00:07:27,498 --> 00:07:30,419
I was too excited that I couldn't sleep.

117
00:07:30,419 --> 00:07:33,100
Why don't you go rustic style today?

118
00:07:33,100 --> 00:07:34,858
We'll have many guests here today.

119
00:07:34,858 --> 00:07:36,639
As the image representative of our clinic,

120
00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:39,639
I must get myself dolled up not to disgrace our team.

121
00:07:39,640 --> 00:07:41,899
Okay. Outstanding.

122
00:07:42,419 --> 00:07:47,119
Su, you have an utterly different personality from Ye.

123
00:07:47,119 --> 00:07:50,899
Which one do you prefer?

124
00:07:50,899 --> 00:07:52,839
Both.

125
00:07:53,940 --> 00:07:58,580
Now that Dr. Ye isn't here, you have to say you prefer me.

126
00:07:59,399 --> 00:08:02,731
Well, I like you.

127
00:08:02,731 --> 00:08:04,765
Thanks, Director.

128
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:10,613
Su, who is helping in the clinic now,

129
00:08:10,613 --> 00:08:13,736
has just started working for half a year, and he's not from our hospital.

130
00:08:13,736 --> 00:08:16,519
A little brother. Is he handsome?

131
00:08:16,519 --> 00:08:18,559
Handsome or not, I don't know.

132
00:08:18,559 --> 00:08:21,939
He seems active when chatting on WeChat.

133
00:08:21,939 --> 00:08:25,539
Deputy Director said he's an amusing person.

134
00:08:25,539 --> 00:08:29,060
Even Director Li, who rarely speaks ordinary words, is coaxed into a cheerful mood by him.

135
00:08:29,060 --> 00:08:31,420
I'll get to know him in a while.

136
00:08:31,420 --> 00:08:34,518
I can't resist humorous men.

137
00:08:34,518 --> 00:08:38,020
Doctor Zeng, are you going in order to make friends?

138
00:08:45,699 --> 00:08:47,919
Why are you silent?

139
00:08:48,683 --> 00:08:51,497
What a topic killer you are!

140
00:08:51,497 --> 00:08:53,520
What do you mean?

141
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:57,050
What you said sounds like criticism.

142
00:08:57,050 --> 00:09:00,200
Dr. Zeng, I don't mean it. Don't take it seriously.

143
00:09:01,379 --> 00:09:04,880
President Lu is also a humorous man.

144
00:09:05,699 --> 00:09:10,679
A leader's sense of humor is quite stressful.

145
00:09:11,819 --> 00:09:16,139
Well, Dr. Ye, does my sense of humor stress you out?

146
00:09:16,139 --> 00:09:18,740
President, should I be stressed?

147
00:09:18,740 --> 00:09:21,140
If you ask me, it seems you aren't.

148
00:09:21,140 --> 00:09:23,639
I'm not but it doesn't mean others are not either.

149
00:09:23,639 --> 00:09:25,899
Then you're quite special.

150
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:31,459
Dr. Zeng, President is joking with you.

151
00:09:31,459 --> 00:09:34,560
If you don't think it's funny, just forget it.

152
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:37,039
That's it. Don't take me as a president.

153
00:09:37,039 --> 00:09:39,319
Let's talk casually.

154
00:09:39,319 --> 00:09:43,939
Don't keep silent, or I'll be nothing but your driver.

155
00:09:46,860 --> 00:09:52,399
Dr. Zeng, aren't you curious about what kind of girl President Lu likes?

156
00:09:54,300 --> 00:09:56,519
I'm very curious.

157
00:09:56,519 --> 00:09:59,340
Can you tell us?

158
00:10:00,699 --> 00:10:03,580
Why? Do you want to introduce someone to me?

159
00:10:03,580 --> 00:10:07,299
As an eligible bachelor, President can find one in minutes.

160
00:10:07,299 --> 00:10:11,339
Just tell us. Maybe I can help you out.

161
00:10:13,519 --> 00:10:15,719
I already have someone in my heart.

162
00:10:16,459 --> 00:10:19,060
Who's so lucky?

163
00:10:19,060 --> 00:10:23,619
Dr. Zeng, you know, I was President Lu's ex-girlfriend.

164
00:10:23,619 --> 00:10:26,759
- Actually, many of us know this already.
- Really?

165
00:10:26,759 --> 00:10:30,480
I thought you were going to get back together with the president.

166
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:33,400
Dr. Ye thought so, too.

167
00:10:33,900 --> 00:10:37,099
I was committed to Qiao Yu at college for some time,

168
00:10:37,099 --> 00:10:40,499
but realized there was so no spark and we became good friends.

169
00:10:40,499 --> 00:10:44,520
Qiao Yu always jokes about it, which caused Dr. Ye to misunderstand.

170
00:10:45,180 --> 00:10:50,999
President Lu must spoil his wife in the future.

171
00:10:50,999 --> 00:10:52,820
How can you tell?

172
00:10:52,820 --> 00:10:53,860
It's...

173
00:10:53,860 --> 00:10:57,999
We'll be there in half an hour. Pretty fast.

174
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:00,819
Pretty fast.

175
00:11:19,994 --> 00:11:22,803
- You're here for the first time.
- Good environment, right?

176
00:11:30,579 --> 00:11:31,680
Dr. Ye?

177
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:33,359
Yes.

178
00:11:33,359 --> 00:11:35,938
Hi, I'm Su, Su Xiaoyang. We finally meet.

179
00:11:35,938 --> 00:11:39,039
Su, nice to meet you. This is President Lu.

180
00:11:39,039 --> 00:11:40,621
Hi, President Lu.

181
00:11:40,621 --> 00:11:42,340
- I'm Zeng Xinyu.
- Thanks for your hard work.

182
00:11:42,340 --> 00:11:44,038
- Hi.
- She's Qiao Yu.

183
00:11:44,038 --> 00:11:45,083
Nice to meet you.

184
00:11:45,083 --> 00:11:48,580
She's the director of the documentary, and wants to learn more about the free clinic here.

185
00:11:48,590 --> 00:11:52,086
On behalf of Taoyuan Village Clinic, I welcome you all.

186
00:11:52,086 --> 00:11:55,540
Su, it's still early. Show them around.

187
00:11:55,540 --> 00:11:57,019
They want to feed the sheep.

188
00:11:57,019 --> 00:11:58,979
Feed the sheep? No problem. Follow me.

189
00:11:58,979 --> 00:12:00,379
Let's go.

190
00:12:01,900 --> 00:12:03,278
I just finished feeding them grass. They are quite happy.

191
00:12:03,278 --> 00:12:04,939
Really?

192
00:12:05,777 --> 00:12:07,785
Were you jealous just now in the car?

193
00:12:07,785 --> 00:12:09,819
Qiao Yu was kidding.

194
00:12:09,819 --> 00:12:12,400
Am I that narrow-minded?

195
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:14,259
Of course not.

196
00:12:14,259 --> 00:12:17,919
I am. If I had known, I'd have come by bus.

197
00:12:17,919 --> 00:12:21,928
Didn't you insist on dragging them into the car to avoid suspicion?

198
00:12:21,928 --> 00:12:25,940
Anyway, your performance today was good.

199
00:12:25,940 --> 00:12:28,159
I'll award you with a kiss.

200
00:12:36,619 --> 00:12:40,500
I forgot I put on lipstick. It's on your cheek.

201
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:42,640
Let me wipe it up with tissues.

202
00:12:42,640 --> 00:12:44,899
Ye, stop dawdling. Ye, why didn't you come in?

203
00:12:44,899 --> 00:12:47,300
You're finally here.

204
00:12:48,039 --> 00:12:50,000
What're you doing?

205
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,259
His face is burning hot.

206
00:12:52,259 --> 00:12:54,698
- Can't you feel it?
- Let me see.

207
00:12:54,698 --> 00:12:57,139
No, thanks, Director. It's not a big deal.

208
00:12:57,139 --> 00:13:00,633
He just got hot while driving. Hurry and wash your face.

209
00:13:00,633 --> 00:13:02,238
Right, let me calm down.

210
00:13:02,238 --> 00:13:03,999
- Go ahead.
- See you, Director.

211
00:13:03,999 --> 00:13:05,019
Is he okay?

212
00:13:05,019 --> 00:13:08,679
Don't worry. Deputy Director, come on. Here you are.

213
00:13:08,679 --> 00:13:10,579
- Are these all for us?
- Yes.

214
00:13:10,579 --> 00:13:11,639
It's for you.

215
00:13:11,639 --> 00:13:14,598
I'm satisfied that you can come.

216
00:13:14,598 --> 00:13:16,918
Why bother wasting money to buy gifts?

217
00:13:16,919 --> 00:13:19,879
Just out of kindness, it's not a waste at all.

218
00:13:19,880 --> 00:13:23,999
- Some for you to eat, others to use.
- Thanks.

219
00:13:23,999 --> 00:13:25,879
Let's go.

220
00:13:25,879 --> 00:13:27,000
The trunk lid.

221
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,420
It's okay. Leave it till later.

222
00:13:32,459 --> 00:13:33,439
Did you miss me?

223
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:35,700
Definitely.

224
00:13:36,579 --> 00:13:39,539
President Lu, have some peanuts, melon seeds, and tea.

225
00:13:39,539 --> 00:13:41,899
Deputy Director, just call me Lu.

226
00:13:41,899 --> 00:13:45,240
Lu, let me take your temperature just in case.

227
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:47,899
No, thanks. It has cooled down.

228
00:13:49,900 --> 00:13:53,119
- Not a fever.
- It's okay.

229
00:13:53,119 --> 00:13:55,659
Lu looks like a president.

230
00:13:55,659 --> 00:13:59,302
Ye even took you as a medical liquor pedlar.

231
00:13:59,302 --> 00:14:02,218
No, I didn't. You thought so, too.

232
00:14:02,218 --> 00:14:04,158
- Did I?
- Yes.

233
00:14:04,158 --> 00:14:06,420
Director can prove it for me, right?

234
00:14:06,420 --> 00:14:08,980
I was misled by you.

235
00:14:10,699 --> 00:14:12,400
Where's Bai?

236
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:16,039
Who knows? Leave it alone.

237
00:14:18,939 --> 00:14:20,919
It seems the troops are here, and we can start working.

238
00:14:20,919 --> 00:14:23,239
Thank you for your hard work.

239
00:14:26,219 --> 00:14:29,319
<i>Patient No.45, your turn.</i>

240
00:14:40,719 --> 00:14:43,699
<i>Patient No.46, your turn.</i>

241
00:14:54,499 --> 00:14:55,740
Thanks, brother.

242
00:14:55,740 --> 00:14:58,120
<i>Patient No.47, it's your turn.</i>
- You're welcome.

243
00:14:59,619 --> 00:15:01,100
Auntie, can I get you some water?

244
00:15:01,100 --> 00:15:02,840
Thank you.

245
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:07,279
Patient No.48, it's your turn.

246
00:15:07,279 --> 00:15:08,840
Coming.

247
00:15:11,683 --> 00:15:13,680
Show me your medical records.

248
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:15,520
This way.

249
00:15:18,008 --> 00:15:19,900
I got examined at the hospital,

250
00:15:19,900 --> 00:15:23,219
and was diagnosed with arteriosclerosis.

251
00:15:23,219 --> 00:15:26,987
It's said raw eggs soaked in vinegar can soften vessels.

252
00:15:26,987 --> 00:15:28,579
Is there this kind of therapy?

253
00:15:28,579 --> 00:15:31,199
Uncle, I know the saying,

254
00:15:31,199 --> 00:15:35,258
but as far as I know, currently there's no clear evidence

255
00:15:35,258 --> 00:15:37,580
raw eggs soaked in vinegar can soften vessels.

256
00:15:37,580 --> 00:15:41,720
- Besides, bacteria are everywhere
<i>- No.49.</i>

257
00:15:41,720 --> 00:15:45,500
on the surface of domestic eggs, so I don't advise you to eat them like this.

258
00:15:45,500 --> 00:15:47,939
I see. I won't eat them then.

259
00:15:48,619 --> 00:15:51,299
Auntie, your blood pressure is normal.

260
00:15:51,299 --> 00:15:56,838
Doctor, I often feel sick to my stomach after dinner and bloated.

261
00:15:56,838 --> 00:15:59,038
What do you usually eat for dinner?

262
00:15:59,038 --> 00:16:00,939
Eat the leftovers from lunch.

263
00:16:00,939 --> 00:16:02,139
Is that a lot?

264
00:16:02,139 --> 00:16:04,819
As much as was left.

265
00:16:04,819 --> 00:16:07,138
It may be indigestion.

266
00:16:07,138 --> 00:16:09,618
I bought digestive pills, but they didn't work.

267
00:16:09,618 --> 00:16:13,118
Auntie, it's like this. How about controlling your diet at night?

268
00:16:13,118 --> 00:16:17,099
You can't eat too much, or it'll cause stomach problems and obesity,

269
00:16:17,099 --> 00:16:20,339
and it will also cause an unnecessary burden on other parts of the body.

270
00:16:20,339 --> 00:16:21,739
For you...

271
00:16:21,800 --> 00:16:23,200
- President.
- Where are you going?

272
00:16:23,280 --> 00:16:27,218
Su will take me to visit several patients who are unable to come here and bring them medicine while we are there.

273
00:16:27,218 --> 00:16:29,199
All right. Where's Qiao Yu?

274
00:16:29,199 --> 00:16:31,379
Giving out medicine and books on the second floor.

275
00:16:31,379 --> 00:16:32,300
I see.

276
00:16:32,300 --> 00:16:34,480
President, bye.

277
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:36,780
<i>Patient No.50, your turn.</i>

278
00:16:36,780 --> 00:16:38,359
<i>Coming.</i>

279
00:16:39,540 --> 00:16:41,918
I checked it just now and there's nothing wrong.

280
00:16:41,918 --> 00:16:47,458
Most children who stammer have psychological disorders.

281
00:16:47,458 --> 00:16:49,219
Encourage him to speak often

282
00:16:49,219 --> 00:16:52,779
by singing or reciting nursery rhymes

283
00:16:52,779 --> 00:16:54,739
to build up his confidence.

284
00:16:54,739 --> 00:16:59,436
As adults, don't point out his stutter once he speaks,

285
00:16:59,436 --> 00:17:02,020
or his psychological pressure will increase.

286
00:17:02,020 --> 00:17:03,258
He's so little.

287
00:17:03,258 --> 00:17:06,532
With proper intervention, his stutter will be corrected soon. Don't worry.

288
00:17:06,532 --> 00:17:07,978
<i>- No. 51.
- Okay.</i>

289
00:17:07,978 --> 00:17:09,260
- Thanks, Doctor.
<i>- Come here.</i>

290
00:17:09,260 --> 00:17:10,300
<i>My pleasure.</i>

291
00:17:10,300 --> 00:17:14,600
Qiu, say "Thanks, Doctor."

292
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:16,380
- I'm not in a hurry. Slowly.
- Speak.

293
00:17:16,380 --> 00:17:17,600
Say it.

294
00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:20,939
Thanks... Doctor...

295
00:17:20,939 --> 00:17:22,418
Excellent!

296
00:17:22,418 --> 00:17:24,240
Talk more when you are back home.

297
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:26,179
Here's your medical record book.

298
00:17:26,179 --> 00:17:27,919
Okay, thank you.

299
00:17:27,919 --> 00:17:30,500
Say goodbye.

300
00:17:30,500 --> 00:17:32,399
Goodbye.

301
00:17:33,659 --> 00:17:36,820
Uncle, you may get a book for free at the pharmacy.

302
00:17:36,820 --> 00:17:39,360
It's written by Chief Huang

303
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:41,652
with a detailed introduction to stuttering intervention.

304
00:17:41,653 --> 00:17:44,520
- Go to the second floor right here.
- Thanks.

305
00:17:44,520 --> 00:17:45,820
- Welcome.
- Thanks a lot.

306
00:17:45,820 --> 00:17:47,000
Thanks.

307
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:53,260
President, I didn't expect my books to be donated to the patients.

308
00:17:53,260 --> 00:17:56,031
I read this book. It's easy to understand,

309
00:17:56,031 --> 00:17:59,338
so I bought some to give out for free on my behalf.

310
00:17:59,338 --> 00:18:02,580
It's also Dr. Ye's proposal.

311
00:18:03,259 --> 00:18:05,859
Dr. Ye, thank you.

312
00:18:05,859 --> 00:18:07,870
You're welcome, Chief Huang.

313
00:18:07,870 --> 00:18:10,699
<i>Patient No.12, your turn.</i>

314
00:18:10,699 --> 00:18:13,719
Are... Are you President Lu?

315
00:18:13,719 --> 00:18:15,739
It's me, Granny Fang.

316
00:18:15,739 --> 00:18:18,559
Deputy Director told me that you were the president.

317
00:18:18,559 --> 00:18:20,799
I was so sorry last time.

318
00:18:20,799 --> 00:18:26,300
I didn't see clearly, and mistook you for a medical liquor pedlar,

319
00:18:26,300 --> 00:18:30,880
letting Dr. Ye chase after you with a broom.

320
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:32,969
Granny Fang, it's not your fault.

321
00:18:32,970 --> 00:18:35,478
I told her I was the president, but she didn't believe it.

322
00:18:35,479 --> 00:18:36,999
It's not your fault.

323
00:18:36,999 --> 00:18:38,378
No, no, no!

324
00:18:38,378 --> 00:18:42,538
You are a nice person that doesn't hold any grudges.

325
00:18:42,538 --> 00:18:46,299
You even let Dr. Ye work at your hospital.

326
00:18:46,299 --> 00:18:48,821
Granny Fang, he has many grudges.

327
00:18:48,821 --> 00:18:52,020
He has been against my being a doctor for a long time.

328
00:18:53,180 --> 00:18:55,279
I don't believe it.

329
00:18:55,279 --> 00:18:59,559
Look, so many experts treat us for free.

330
00:18:59,559 --> 00:19:01,819
You're such a kind person.

331
00:19:01,819 --> 00:19:04,400
It's true. He's against me.

332
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:07,500
President has long known Dr. Ye.

333
00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:10,325
No wonder he chose Dr. Ye as his assistant.

334
00:19:10,325 --> 00:19:13,360
Well, Zhao, let's talk outside.

335
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:15,979
Granny Fang, how's your granddaughter?

336
00:19:15,979 --> 00:19:17,539
Her eyesight is poor.

337
00:19:17,539 --> 00:19:21,051
She overuses her eyes with electronic products.

338
00:19:21,051 --> 00:19:24,239
Does she usually play with her phone and watch TV?

339
00:19:24,239 --> 00:19:25,755
She is slightly shortsighted.

340
00:19:25,755 --> 00:19:28,489
I prescribe a bottle of eyedrops to relieve her eyes' dryness.

341
00:19:28,489 --> 00:19:31,099
But still be careful not to overuse the eyes.

342
00:19:31,099 --> 00:19:32,680
Do you hear her?

343
00:19:32,680 --> 00:19:34,810
Get the medicine on the second floor.

344
00:19:34,810 --> 00:19:36,260
- Thanks.
- Welcome.

345
00:19:36,260 --> 00:19:38,698
- President, thank you. Thanks a lot.
- It's my duty.

346
00:19:38,698 --> 00:19:42,260
<i>No.54, your turn.</i>

347
00:19:46,315 --> 00:19:50,110
You must be thirsty. Have some water.

348
00:19:51,199 --> 00:19:53,000
Thanks.

349
00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:01,300
<i>[Time Garden Cafe]</i>

350
00:20:02,660 --> 00:20:05,280
Welcome. This way.

351
00:20:15,639 --> 00:20:18,880
<i>Will you come to our cafe today?</i>

352
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:22,020
<i>[Inept Adviser]</i>

353
00:20:26,239 --> 00:20:29,099
<i>When will you be free? I want to treat you.</i>

354
00:20:36,680 --> 00:20:39,880
I haven't seen that friend of yours these days.

355
00:20:39,880 --> 00:20:41,618
He has been busy.

356
00:20:41,618 --> 00:20:43,539
You stare at the door from time to time.

357
00:20:43,539 --> 00:20:46,039
Are you looking forward to his appearance?

358
00:20:46,039 --> 00:20:47,498
Of course not.

359
00:20:47,498 --> 00:20:49,739
No? I thought you liked him.

360
00:20:49,739 --> 00:20:51,560
Not the case.

361
00:20:51,560 --> 00:20:52,748
What a pity!

362
00:20:52,749 --> 00:20:54,060
I think he's quite handsome.

363
00:20:54,060 --> 00:20:56,660
If you don't like him, introduce him to me.

364
00:20:56,660 --> 00:20:58,300
He already has someone he likes.

365
00:20:58,300 --> 00:21:00,919
Really?

366
00:21:00,919 --> 00:21:03,040
He told me in person.

367
00:21:09,979 --> 00:21:11,640
Thanks.

368
00:21:13,460 --> 00:21:15,939
See you. Bye.

369
00:21:27,919 --> 00:21:29,680
You're here.

370
00:21:30,600 --> 00:21:34,239
Why are you leaving work so early today?

371
00:21:34,739 --> 00:21:36,979
The manager rescheduled it.

372
00:21:43,119 --> 00:21:44,919
Hurry inside.

373
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:49,280
Okay. Bye-bye.

374
00:22:25,300 --> 00:22:26,900
May I sit here?

375
00:22:26,900 --> 00:22:28,260
Of course.

376
00:22:28,280 --> 00:22:29,639
Aren't you off work?

377
00:22:29,639 --> 00:22:34,183
Yes, now I'm a customer treating you to fruits.

378
00:22:34,183 --> 00:22:36,859
Did you come back for me?

379
00:22:36,859 --> 00:22:39,299
Yes, I did. Am I bothering you?

380
00:22:39,299 --> 00:22:40,180
No.

381
00:22:40,180 --> 00:22:41,279
Have some fruit.

382
00:22:41,279 --> 00:22:42,880
Okay.

383
00:22:48,460 --> 00:22:52,820
Have you made any progress with that female friend you like?

384
00:22:52,820 --> 00:22:55,065
Why ask about this suddenly?

385
00:22:55,065 --> 00:22:56,258
I revised my script.

386
00:22:56,258 --> 00:22:59,459
Kevin's image has changed so much.

387
00:22:59,459 --> 00:23:02,810
I want to know if it will help your love life after reading it.

388
00:23:03,420 --> 00:23:05,920
I can't tell for sure.

389
00:23:08,279 --> 00:23:10,337
Then I think you should evaluate

390
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:12,340
Then I think you have to seriously judge and see how likely it is for the two of you.

391
00:23:12,340 --> 00:23:14,900
If not, you have to stop the loss in time.

392
00:23:14,939 --> 00:23:17,060
How do I judge her?

393
00:23:21,524 --> 00:23:24,018
What about this? Ask her here to the store.

394
00:23:24,018 --> 00:23:26,319
Let me observe her for you.

395
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:28,459
You'd be able to tell?

396
00:23:28,459 --> 00:23:32,000
Of course, I'm trained in this field.

397
00:23:33,560 --> 00:23:35,100
Don't you believe it?

398
00:23:35,100 --> 00:23:37,299
Am I supposed to believe you?

399
00:23:38,519 --> 00:23:42,339
It's time to show my real expertise.

400
00:23:42,339 --> 00:23:45,844
Let me observe you first. See if I'm right or wrong.

401
00:23:45,844 --> 00:23:48,699
Well, give it a shot.

402
00:23:51,859 --> 00:23:53,519
You...

403
00:23:58,599 --> 00:24:01,259
There is a secret that cannot be told to others.

404
00:24:01,259 --> 00:24:02,580
It's true for everyone.

405
00:24:02,580 --> 00:24:04,640
Don't worry.

406
00:24:08,039 --> 00:24:10,439
Do you work in a hospital?

407
00:24:11,500 --> 00:24:14,420
Your clothes smell of disinfectant.

408
00:24:15,180 --> 00:24:18,138
You can't smell it. Only I can.

409
00:24:20,739 --> 00:24:22,499
You must have heard my phone call.

410
00:24:22,499 --> 00:24:24,620
So you admit it.

411
00:24:24,620 --> 00:24:26,319
You're right.

412
00:24:32,460 --> 00:24:36,239
Has anyone around you been in love recently?

413
00:24:36,820 --> 00:24:38,459
How can you tell?

414
00:24:38,459 --> 00:24:43,199
There's romance in the air around you

415
00:24:43,199 --> 00:24:46,000
but it's not yours.

416
00:24:48,840 --> 00:24:52,078
You can't see it. Only I can.

417
00:24:54,759 --> 00:24:56,560
You're right.

418
00:24:57,060 --> 00:24:58,900
What else?

419
00:24:59,780 --> 00:25:01,780
Show me your hand.

420
00:25:02,671 --> 00:25:05,000
Are you going to read my palm?

421
00:25:10,700 --> 00:25:13,899
Your love line has many tiny forks.

422
00:25:13,899 --> 00:25:15,046
What does it mean?

423
00:25:15,047 --> 00:25:20,239
It means you like to watch other people fall in love.

424
00:25:21,456 --> 00:25:23,420
Let me read your palm.

425
00:25:25,999 --> 00:25:28,339
You also have many tiny forks.

426
00:25:28,339 --> 00:25:30,090
Mine turns outward.

427
00:25:30,090 --> 00:25:33,225
It means I like to write others' love stories.

428
00:25:38,462 --> 00:25:40,141
You got it wrong.

429
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:42,200
I don't like to observe others' relationships.

430
00:25:42,200 --> 00:25:44,900
Impossible. I never got it wrong. Let me read it carefully.

431
00:25:55,219 --> 00:25:58,479
They're your colleagues.

432
00:25:58,979 --> 00:26:02,380
One is your boss.

433
00:26:02,380 --> 00:26:05,074
At first, you thought they were a perfect match.

434
00:26:06,019 --> 00:26:10,938
You lied. The girl you like doesn't exist.

435
00:26:10,938 --> 00:26:14,939
I'm right. You just like to watch other people fall in love.

436
00:26:14,939 --> 00:26:18,719
This is the secret you can't tell.

437
00:26:27,039 --> 00:26:29,039
You know Dr. Ye, right?

438
00:26:30,739 --> 00:26:32,780
Assistant Lin.

439
00:26:32,780 --> 00:26:36,205
Thinking about it, pay me some hush money.

440
00:26:37,239 --> 00:26:40,939
Okay. What do you want to eat?

441
00:26:58,160 --> 00:27:01,279
Chief Huang often treats patients for free. He's experienced.

442
00:27:01,279 --> 00:27:03,560
This afternoon when treating two special patients,

443
00:27:03,560 --> 00:27:06,240
he asked me to observe and guided me.

444
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:09,320
As you said, he may not be a good leader,

445
00:27:09,320 --> 00:27:11,440
but he is a good doctor.

446
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:12,901
People have all kinds of sides.

447
00:27:12,901 --> 00:27:16,153
It depends on which side you're lucky enough to encounter.

448
00:27:17,037 --> 00:27:19,039
There shouldn't be many people tomorrow morning.

449
00:27:19,039 --> 00:27:23,400
We're running out of patients. We'll only receive patients who're here for checkup results,

450
00:27:23,400 --> 00:27:26,040
and then we'll all go back together.

451
00:27:26,040 --> 00:27:27,699
Qiao Yu left this afternoon.

452
00:27:27,699 --> 00:27:31,979
Dr. Zeng just told me she'd like to take the bus tomorrow.

453
00:27:35,979 --> 00:27:39,419
So it means I'll go back with my leader alone.

454
00:27:39,419 --> 00:27:42,400
Yeah. How miserable you are.

455
00:27:44,379 --> 00:27:48,980
After dinner, you should go back to the hotel in town and get some rest early.

456
00:27:48,980 --> 00:27:50,260
Won't you go?

457
00:27:50,260 --> 00:27:53,359
Su has been living in the village. My room is empty.

458
00:27:53,359 --> 00:27:56,199
I'll stay here today.

459
00:27:57,099 --> 00:28:00,260
Then... I won't go back as well.

460
00:28:00,260 --> 00:28:02,520
Where will you stay then?

461
00:28:09,239 --> 00:28:10,799
It won't do.

462
00:28:10,799 --> 00:28:12,680
How come?

463
00:28:13,759 --> 00:28:17,340
Then they'll know about our relationship.

464
00:28:17,340 --> 00:28:21,699
You mean once they know it, it'll be okay for us to...

465
00:28:21,699 --> 00:28:23,320
Don't misunderstand me.

466
00:28:23,320 --> 00:28:25,038
You misunderstand me.

467
00:28:25,038 --> 00:28:28,539
I mean... tonight I can sleep in the infusion room.

468
00:28:29,259 --> 00:28:31,140
What're you thinking about?

469
00:28:31,140 --> 00:28:33,640
Are you coveting me?

470
00:28:33,640 --> 00:28:35,479
- How come?
- There you go!

471
00:28:35,479 --> 00:28:37,879
I'm just a baby! What're you thinking?

472
00:28:37,879 --> 00:28:41,218
- Use your tongue, not your fist.
- You need to be fixed up.

473
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:43,800
Here!

474
00:28:46,979 --> 00:28:50,762
Ye is so bold that she dares to beat the president.

475
00:28:50,762 --> 00:28:54,140
Our president is easygoing.

476
00:28:54,140 --> 00:28:56,278
Others may think you're dating.

477
00:28:56,278 --> 00:28:57,379
Not at all.

478
00:28:57,379 --> 00:28:58,799
Not really?

479
00:28:58,799 --> 00:29:03,360
Deputy Director, how can Dr. Ye cheat you?

480
00:29:05,279 --> 00:29:09,378
I haven't eaten vegetables fresh from the field for a long time.

481
00:29:09,378 --> 00:29:12,959
We specially prepared fresh pork and pig blood for you.

482
00:29:12,959 --> 00:29:15,819
It's rare for you to have these in the city.

483
00:29:15,819 --> 00:29:16,999
- Thanks, Director.
- Thanks, Director.

484
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:18,500
Well, you can get inside.

485
00:29:18,500 --> 00:29:21,059
We'll start cooking after we pick the vegetables.

486
00:29:25,139 --> 00:29:27,479
Can't we even let them know?

487
00:29:27,479 --> 00:29:29,439
There's no secret here.

488
00:29:29,439 --> 00:29:32,338
If they know, everyone in the village will know.

489
00:29:32,338 --> 00:29:34,539
Did you forget what Granny Fang said today?

490
00:29:34,539 --> 00:29:38,180
Well, I won't suffer by obeying my girlfriend.

491
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:44,280
There you go.

492
00:29:53,379 --> 00:29:55,900
- This tastes nice.
- Okay, thanks.

493
00:29:56,580 --> 00:30:00,619
When you said those things, I guessed you might know people around me.

494
00:30:00,619 --> 00:30:05,480
Unexpectedly, I just didn't expect you to even like me to read romance novels.

495
00:30:07,379 --> 00:30:11,400
I know I've told too many lies about this matter. I can't see the flaws myself.

496
00:30:13,300 --> 00:30:17,520
But it's quite amazing you're Dr. Ye's bestie.

497
00:30:17,520 --> 00:30:21,239
What a coincidence!

498
00:30:21,239 --> 00:30:26,679
I've decided to adapt the story of your president and Ye to my next novel.

499
00:30:26,728 --> 00:30:28,059
It happens in a hospital.

500
00:30:28,059 --> 00:30:29,299
That's it.

501
00:30:29,299 --> 00:30:32,940
If there is anything I don't understand by then, you must help me.

502
00:30:32,940 --> 00:30:35,472
I don't know about doctors, either.

503
00:30:36,060 --> 00:30:38,560
I mean the management part.

504
00:30:39,991 --> 00:30:42,540
For the doctor stuff, I can ask Ye.

505
00:30:42,540 --> 00:30:46,480
But we don't write too many professional things when we write this kind of novel itself.

506
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:48,539
Sometimes if it's necessary for the plot,

507
00:30:48,539 --> 00:30:51,480
we'll try to make as few mistakes as possible.

508
00:30:51,480 --> 00:30:53,747
Are you worried about others' complaints?

509
00:30:53,747 --> 00:30:55,699
What complaints?

510
00:30:55,699 --> 00:30:59,940
Like what kind of clothes are you wearing to fall in love?

511
00:30:59,940 --> 00:31:02,420
I'm not writing a professional novel.

512
00:31:02,420 --> 00:31:03,978
It's all about romance.

513
00:31:03,978 --> 00:31:08,125
Of the comments on my novel, people who said so tend to follow the crowd and show off.

514
00:31:08,125 --> 00:31:10,899
They saw such comments in other places,

515
00:31:10,899 --> 00:31:13,219
and copied them regardless of the context,

516
00:31:13,219 --> 00:31:15,639
thinking themselves smart.

517
00:31:15,639 --> 00:31:19,300
Someone may ask why you write about doctors.

518
00:31:19,979 --> 00:31:23,859
The main characters in a romance novel can't all be unemployed.

519
00:31:23,859 --> 00:31:27,379
No one stipulates which profession cannot fall in love.

520
00:31:27,379 --> 00:31:30,200
There is. This.

521
00:31:32,300 --> 00:31:36,239
It's okay for this in some places.

522
00:31:37,499 --> 00:31:41,663
I mean if a profession doesn't allow love

523
00:31:41,663 --> 00:31:43,579
or can't be written into a romance novel,

524
00:31:43,579 --> 00:31:47,380
is it this profession or love itself that is despised?

525
00:31:48,080 --> 00:31:49,280
Yes.

526
00:31:49,280 --> 00:31:52,018
Every profession deserves and is worthy of love.

527
00:31:52,018 --> 00:31:56,016
Right? If you write badly, you will criticize the badly written.

528
00:31:56,016 --> 00:31:58,800
Love is beautiful.

529
00:31:58,800 --> 00:32:01,437
I want it. You want it, too.

530
00:32:01,437 --> 00:32:04,098
I like you, and you like me.

531
00:32:04,098 --> 00:32:09,400
Let's be together and have a sweet love.

532
00:32:23,513 --> 00:32:25,340
You must have read many comments,

533
00:32:25,340 --> 00:32:28,020
or you wouldn't know how much they complain about me.

534
00:32:28,020 --> 00:32:31,599
Right, but only your comment section.

535
00:32:34,879 --> 00:32:36,640
Let me interview you.

536
00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:40,479
What was your first impression of me?

537
00:32:46,580 --> 00:32:51,619
Since I'm a fan of your novels, when I found out you were right in front of me,

538
00:32:51,619 --> 00:32:53,690
I was a bit...

539
00:32:54,500 --> 00:32:56,490
excited.

540
00:32:56,490 --> 00:32:58,370
Was it like seeing an idol?

541
00:32:58,370 --> 00:32:59,970
No.

542
00:32:59,970 --> 00:33:04,240
Like acquaintances who have never met but have known each other for a long time.

543
00:33:04,240 --> 00:33:06,820
Never met.

544
00:33:08,890 --> 00:33:10,960
I like this expression.

545
00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:15,500
The author naturally resonates with readers.

546
00:33:15,500 --> 00:33:18,879
So when you asked me to revise my script, was it an excuse to see me?

547
00:33:18,879 --> 00:33:22,759
Not exactly. I did feel strange when reading it.

548
00:33:25,060 --> 00:33:27,719
If it wasn't for this,

549
00:33:28,619 --> 00:33:31,019
would you want to get to know me?

550
00:33:35,099 --> 00:33:37,000
No, I wouldn't.

551
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:39,942
You just said we were friends.

552
00:33:39,942 --> 00:33:42,268
I wouldn't have wanted to disturb you.

553
00:33:45,786 --> 00:33:48,378
But to have a chance to know you, eat with you,

554
00:33:48,378 --> 00:33:50,839
chat with you, help you,

555
00:33:50,839 --> 00:33:54,619
and know what you're like in real life makes me so happy.

556
00:33:55,300 --> 00:33:58,280
That's what a fan is dreaming of.

557
00:33:58,280 --> 00:34:00,299
Maybe it's true.

558
00:34:01,060 --> 00:34:03,600
Come on, my dear fan.

559
00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:05,459
My idol.

560
00:34:14,020 --> 00:34:18,100
Auntie Zhang, now we seldom use antibiotics.

561
00:34:18,100 --> 00:34:21,420
Yeah, in case of drug resistance.

562
00:34:21,859 --> 00:34:24,700
Just follow the doctor's instructions.

563
00:34:24,700 --> 00:34:26,820
No problem. You're welcome.

564
00:34:26,820 --> 00:34:29,739
Let my mom answer the phone.

565
00:34:30,339 --> 00:34:31,299
<i>Lanlan.</i>

566
00:34:31,299 --> 00:34:33,740
Mom, what's up?

567
00:34:33,740 --> 00:34:35,939
<i>Are you getting along well with Lu?</i>

568
00:34:35,939 --> 00:34:37,740
Pretty good.

569
00:34:37,740 --> 00:34:41,194
The other day we celebrated his mom's birthday together.

570
00:34:41,194 --> 00:34:44,301
You're here. The water is boiled.

571
00:34:45,220 --> 00:34:47,199
<i>Is that Lu?</i>

572
00:34:48,099 --> 00:34:49,020
Yes.

573
00:34:49,020 --> 00:34:51,260
<i>Let me talk to Lu.</i>

574
00:34:53,099 --> 00:34:54,639
All right.

575
00:34:57,479 --> 00:34:58,779
Auntie, good evening.

576
00:34:58,779 --> 00:35:02,179
<i>Lu, are you voluntarily treating patients?</i>

577
00:35:02,179 --> 00:35:03,200
Yeah.

578
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:06,679
<i>Are your parents used to the taste of the sausages I sent you?</i>

579
00:35:06,679 --> 00:35:08,298
They thought them to be very delicious.

580
00:35:08,298 --> 00:35:11,058
Auntie, can you send some more next month?

581
00:35:11,058 --> 00:35:13,219
<i>Sure, sure! No problem.</i>

582
00:35:13,219 --> 00:35:15,058
<i>Want some homemade dried fish?</i>

583
00:35:15,058 --> 00:35:17,678
Great. Let us have a try.

584
00:35:17,678 --> 00:35:21,219
By the way, Auntie, when will you be free to come here for a vacation?

585
00:35:21,219 --> 00:35:23,660
<i>I've many things to mind at home.</i>

586
00:35:23,660 --> 00:35:29,620
It doesn't matter. On the next holiday, I'll go back with Ye Shilan.

587
00:35:29,620 --> 00:35:32,538
<i>Fantastic. I'll make delicious food for you.</i>

588
00:35:32,538 --> 00:35:35,107
Great. I've been dreaming of going back.

589
00:35:35,107 --> 00:35:39,058
- Auntie, remember...
- Mom, I have to take a shower.

590
00:35:39,058 --> 00:35:40,600
Let's talk later on.

591
00:35:40,600 --> 00:35:41,979
<i>Well, go ahead.</i>

592
00:35:41,979 --> 00:35:44,020
Auntie, take care. Good night.

593
00:35:44,020 --> 00:35:46,319
<i>- Good night.</i>
- Good night.

594
00:35:49,759 --> 00:35:52,459
Why are you taking the initiative to ask my mom for things?

595
00:35:52,459 --> 00:35:54,259
Don't you usually have to be polite?

596
00:35:54,259 --> 00:35:58,140
No need. Didn't Auntie really mean to give them to me?

597
00:35:58,140 --> 00:36:00,234
Of course, she meant it.

598
00:36:00,234 --> 00:36:01,540
That's it.

599
00:36:01,540 --> 00:36:04,859
Since it is what Auntie has available, it is exactly what I need.

600
00:36:04,859 --> 00:36:07,960
She must be happy when she feels she is needed.

601
00:36:07,961 --> 00:36:10,550
So I skipped the formalities.

602
00:36:11,060 --> 00:36:14,808
Why did you take the initiative to tell her we'd go back? Are you mad?

603
00:36:15,728 --> 00:36:17,910
Don't you want me to go home with you?

604
00:36:19,059 --> 00:36:20,119
Yes, I do.

605
00:36:20,119 --> 00:36:25,220
As your boyfriend, shouldn't I visit her?

606
00:36:26,420 --> 00:36:28,739
Yes, you should.

607
00:36:30,660 --> 00:36:34,739
But... I'm not ready.

608
00:36:34,739 --> 00:36:36,860
Ready for what?

609
00:36:39,740 --> 00:36:43,539
I haven't told her you're the president.

610
00:36:44,339 --> 00:36:48,999
Just admit you lied. Is it hard to confess?

611
00:36:51,140 --> 00:36:52,539
You may not understand.

612
00:36:52,539 --> 00:36:54,779
On knowing you're from a decent family,

613
00:36:54,779 --> 00:36:59,959
she gave me her credit card for fear that I'd be dwarfed by you.

614
00:36:59,959 --> 00:37:04,700
If she knows you're the president, it'll take time for her to accept it.

615
00:37:04,700 --> 00:37:08,239
I have to find a chance to explain it to her.

616
00:37:12,120 --> 00:37:16,742
I know it. That's why I actively asked your mom for things.

617
00:37:16,742 --> 00:37:21,258
It may give her a sense of fulfillment, and release her burden.

618
00:37:21,880 --> 00:37:23,840
I see.

619
00:37:27,040 --> 00:37:30,560
Where shall I find such a golden boyfriend?

620
00:37:31,660 --> 00:37:34,820
Isn't he right here? Did you forget?

621
00:37:34,820 --> 00:37:38,000
Do you feel a sense of being back home?

622
00:37:39,679 --> 00:37:41,679
It really does.

623
00:37:44,959 --> 00:37:47,639
<i>Lu, have you found Ye?</i>

624
00:37:47,639 --> 00:37:50,059
<i>Why did you not catch anything and lose the dog?</i>

625
00:37:50,059 --> 00:37:53,040
I found her. I'll right be there.

626
00:37:53,040 --> 00:37:54,900
<i>Okay.</i>

627
00:37:54,900 --> 00:37:59,640
♫ <i>You are a part of my life</i> ♫

628
00:37:59,640 --> 00:38:02,550
♫ <i>You're my shining armor</i> ♫

629
00:38:02,550 --> 00:38:05,710
♫ <i>Now I'm pretty sure</i> ♫

630
00:38:05,719 --> 00:38:07,839
♫ <i>We will come to the end. Trust me</i> ♫

631
00:38:07,840 --> 00:38:12,499
Okay. Go downstairs, or Deputy Director will come upstairs.

632
00:38:12,499 --> 00:38:18,339
♫ <i>The dream makes it come true</i> ♫

633
00:38:18,339 --> 00:38:22,200
You can sleep in my room tonight.

634
00:38:22,200 --> 00:38:23,919
Okay.

635
00:38:24,339 --> 00:38:28,000
I'm going to sleep with the director and chat with her.

636
00:38:30,280 --> 00:38:33,198
Don't worry. I don't have any unreasonable thoughts about you.

637
00:38:33,898 --> 00:38:37,280
Between lovers, how can there be any unreasonable thoughts?

638
00:38:37,280 --> 00:38:39,319
♫ <i>Just with you </i> ♫

639
00:38:39,319 --> 00:38:41,560
Don't shoot yourself in the foot.

640
00:38:41,560 --> 00:38:43,400
Just a slip of tongue.

641
00:38:44,020 --> 00:38:46,199
Look in the mirror.

642
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:28,220
Su prepared a nutritious breakfast for us.

643
00:39:28,220 --> 00:39:29,731
Vegetables are fresh from the field.

644
00:39:29,732 --> 00:39:31,050
Soybean milk is freshly ground.

645
00:39:31,050 --> 00:39:33,138
Even the steamed buns are made by himself.

646
00:39:33,138 --> 00:39:34,818
You can even make steamed buns?

647
00:39:34,818 --> 00:39:36,300
How do you like it?

648
00:39:36,300 --> 00:39:37,740

00:39:37,740 --> 00:39:39,602
What do you think, President Lu?

650
00:39:39,602 --> 00:39:41,020
Quite good.

651
00:39:41,020 --> 00:39:42,939
Su can do many other things like

652
00:39:42,939 --> 00:39:44,900
cooking, repairing the radio,

653
00:39:44,900 --> 00:39:46,879
painting walls, and feeding the chickens and sheep.

654
00:39:46,879 --> 00:39:48,858
He can do them perfectly.

655
00:39:48,858 --> 00:39:52,219
I couldn't believe it when you told me on the phone.

656
00:39:52,219 --> 00:39:53,759
I just went to the backyard to have a look.

657
00:39:53,760 --> 00:39:56,758
- The chickens and sheep are fat. Quite tidy there.
- That's it.

658
00:39:56,758 --> 00:39:58,112
Impressive.

659
00:39:58,112 --> 00:39:59,343
Su's also a hairdresser.

660
00:39:59,343 --> 00:40:02,659
The Director and I both had our haircuts by him. What do you think?

661
00:40:02,659 --> 00:40:03,900
Pretty good.

662
00:40:03,900 --> 00:40:06,080
How did you learn to do hair cuts?

663
00:40:06,080 --> 00:40:09,080
When I was a sophomore, I liked a sister in the school barbershop,

664
00:40:09,080 --> 00:40:10,930
and then I often played with her.

665
00:40:10,930 --> 00:40:14,470
I learned to cut hair by watching her work.

666
00:40:14,479 --> 00:40:17,418
What about you? Are you two together?

667
00:40:17,940 --> 00:40:19,179
Yes, we were.

668
00:40:19,179 --> 00:40:22,120
So does she like steamed buns?

669
00:40:22,120 --> 00:40:23,538
No, she doesn't.

670
00:40:23,538 --> 00:40:27,939
I learned to make buns for another girlfriend.

671
00:40:27,939 --> 00:40:30,379
Why is your relationship like an apprenticeship?

672
00:40:30,379 --> 00:40:32,639
No, because...

673
00:40:32,639 --> 00:40:35,019
Su, makes it sound easy. Right?

674
00:40:35,019 --> 00:40:38,138
In fact, he took every relationship seriously.

675
00:40:38,138 --> 00:40:40,119
He's not a playboy.

676
00:40:40,119 --> 00:40:43,719
Ye, don't worry. Don't misunderstand.

677
00:40:43,719 --> 00:40:46,786
It has nothing to do with me, Deputy Director.

678
00:40:46,786 --> 00:40:48,680
Don't you understand?

679
00:40:48,680 --> 00:40:52,128
Deputy Director means to match the two of you.

680
00:40:54,710 --> 00:40:57,539
Dr. Ye, what do you think of me?
