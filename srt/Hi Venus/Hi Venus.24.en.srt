Sneaking up like a thief, I heard it all.

17
00:02:01,900 --> 00:02:04,360
You came pretty quickly.

18
00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:08,379
Isn't it because I wanted to see you sooner?

19
00:02:08,379 --> 00:02:10,619
It's not like you took the initiative to look for me.

20
00:02:10,619 --> 00:02:13,900
I intended to visit you this weekend.

21
00:02:16,659 --> 00:02:18,639
Lack sincerity.

22
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:23,940
Well, my sincerity is a bit heavy.

23
00:02:23,940 --> 00:02:26,080
You have to hold onto it.

We haven't made it up.

Don't try to get away with it.

30
00:02:49,494 --> 00:02:51,679
How can I?

31
00:02:51,679 --> 00:02:55,179
I just liberating myself and want to kiss you.

32
00:02:55,179 --> 00:03:00,900
Kissing me also requires my consent; otherwise, I will sue you for sexual harassment.

33
00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:03,162
Then call the police and arrest me.

34
00:03:07,719 --> 00:03:09,839

Did you dodge me just now to take revenge on me?

45
00:04:04,479 --> 00:04:07,658
Because I also avoided you when you confessed to me?

46
00:04:07,658 --> 00:04:09,379
Am I such a calculating person?

47
00:04:09,379 --> 00:04:11,799
Yes, you're.

48
00:04:11,799 --> 00:04:15,800
When I was new in the hospital, you always terrified me.

49
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:19,840
Because I think you're amusing.

50
00:04:20,620 --> 00:04:22,720
Am I a joke?

51
00:04:23,739 --> 00:04:27,319
Not a joke, but an amusing person.

52
00:04:29,459 --> 00:04:31,920
Okay, I lost.

53
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:34,466
You're better at whispers of love.

54
00:04:37,620 --> 00:04:41,399
Why didn't you say anything in advance when you came here today?

55
00:04:41,399 --> 00:04:45,880
I wanted to surprise you in case you ran away again.

56
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:47,780
I won't run.

57
00:04:47,780 --> 00:04:51,180
I'm here to give medical assistance.

58
00:04:51,180 --> 00:04:52,779
Don't you have work today?

59
00:04:52,779 --> 00:04:57,860
I took a day off to accompany you today with my heart and soul.

60
00:04:58,780 --> 00:05:04,640
Okay, then you can be regarded as paying with some practical actions.

61
00:05:05,540 --> 00:05:09,940
I know you were busy those days

62
00:05:09,940 --> 00:05:14,579
with the hospital crisis and my issue.

63
00:05:14,579 --> 00:05:16,479
Thank you.

64
00:05:17,100 --> 00:05:22,079
Thank you for what? It wasn't because of you, I was at fault.

65
00:05:22,079 --> 00:05:24,357
Thanks for your hard work.

66
00:05:26,979 --> 00:05:32,279
Ye Shilan, I must tell you something.

67
00:05:37,179 --> 00:05:40,499
What's the matter? So serious.

68
00:05:40,499 --> 00:05:43,900
Don't be nervous. It's not bad news.

69
00:05:44,979 --> 00:05:47,099
Then tell me.

70
00:05:47,099 --> 00:05:50,860
Gao Xuan asked someone to investigate your family before.

71
00:05:52,979 --> 00:05:55,780
I heard it from Assistant Lin.

72
00:05:55,780 --> 00:05:59,520
I found a document in the office

73
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:02,440
about your dad's suicide.

74
00:06:05,220 --> 00:06:07,320
Was there a problem?

75
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:17,800
Inside is a copy of the test report showing that your dad went to the hospital a few days before he killed himself...

76
00:06:19,296 --> 00:06:22,196
and was diagnosed with severe disease.

77
00:06:24,459 --> 00:06:28,859
I guess he didn't want to hurt your impoverished family at that time,

78
00:06:28,859 --> 00:06:31,299
so he made that choice.

79
00:06:31,299 --> 00:06:34,160
It wasn't utterly because of his work.

80
00:06:34,940 --> 00:06:37,440
He didn't even tell your mom.

81
00:06:38,660 --> 00:06:43,119
Maybe he just didn't want you to feel guilty.

82
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:54,920
I even blamed him.

83
00:06:56,940 --> 00:06:59,640
I even blamed him.

84
00:06:59,640 --> 00:07:02,160
This is not your fault.

85
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:05,539
You have always listened to him.

86
00:07:05,539 --> 00:07:07,759
Think about it.

87
00:07:07,759 --> 00:07:12,179
You have worked hard and lived seriously.

88
00:07:12,179 --> 00:07:15,040
If only he could see you like this,

89
00:07:15,579 --> 00:07:19,219
he would be proud of you. Right?

90
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:27,320
Don't cry.

91
00:08:32,119 --> 00:08:34,798
- Enjoy.
- Thanks.

92
00:08:35,579 --> 00:08:36,925
I called and asked.

93
00:08:36,925 --> 00:08:40,578
The owner of this cafe is going to develop in other places, so he wants to transfer the cafe.

94
00:08:40,578 --> 00:08:45,340
The price is a bit over your budget, but negotiable.

95
00:08:45,340 --> 00:08:49,440
If you think it's okay, let's talk to the boss.

96
00:08:51,379 --> 00:08:55,279
I think it's nice. Let's call and make an appointment with the boss.

97
00:08:55,279 --> 00:08:56,800
No need to call.

98
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:58,880
He's the boss.

99
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:03,038
He only employs one full-time waiter and one part-timer at night.

100
00:09:03,038 --> 00:09:06,199
When the waiter takes a leave in lieu, he runs the cafe by himself.

101
00:09:06,199 --> 00:09:10,039
With my experience, I should cover it.

102
00:09:10,100 --> 00:09:15,600
Being your own boss has a lot of trivial things and business pressure that you have to take into consideration.

103
00:09:15,639 --> 00:09:17,779
Okay, I know.

104
00:09:18,379 --> 00:09:23,440
It's really nice to write in your own coffee shop, but for a startup,

105
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:28,409
it might take most of my time every day to make coffee, wash cups, and do the cleaning.

106
00:09:28,409 --> 00:09:29,980
That's true.

107
00:09:31,719 --> 00:09:35,479
By the way, how do you plan to partner with Dr. Ye?

108
00:09:35,479 --> 00:09:39,938
She'll invest in this cafe, and will leave the rest to me.

109
00:09:39,938 --> 00:09:43,120
Pretty good. Quite efficient.

110
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:48,620
What do you think I should focus on asking?

111
00:09:49,139 --> 00:09:51,459
I made a plan for you.

112
00:09:51,459 --> 00:09:53,040
You will understand after taking a look.

113
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:56,059
There're several key elements.

114
00:09:57,791 --> 00:10:01,875
You just finished working at the hospital. You just took a break to help me out.

115
00:10:02,499 --> 00:10:05,779
Are you tired of working so hard?

116
00:10:05,779 --> 00:10:09,280
How can your business be considered work?

117
00:10:12,019 --> 00:10:13,560
Thank you.

118
00:10:13,560 --> 00:10:15,459
Welcome.

119
00:10:17,259 --> 00:10:20,939
Besides, don't believe all the sales figures the boss says later.

120
00:10:20,939 --> 00:10:23,120
You still need to do my own research.

121
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:26,111
Don't rush into a decision if you have any doubts.

122
00:10:26,111 --> 00:10:28,500
I'll help you find another place.

123
00:10:31,900 --> 00:10:33,619
What's wrong?

124
00:10:34,259 --> 00:10:36,960
It's nothing, I just like you.

125
00:10:56,699 --> 00:10:58,340
Take care.

126
00:10:58,340 --> 00:11:00,520
Are you really going to let them go?

127
00:11:19,059 --> 00:11:23,000
Let them swim freely.

128
00:11:27,939 --> 00:11:32,780
I'm fine now. Thank you for letting me know.

129
00:11:33,660 --> 00:11:38,859
Letting me know my father's difficulties and understanding his painstaking efforts.

130
00:11:43,939 --> 00:11:47,940
Maybe this is some kind of fate.

131
00:11:47,940 --> 00:11:50,780
If we hadn't met at Taoyuan Village,

132
00:11:50,780 --> 00:11:53,190
or if I hadn't asked you to be my assistant,

133
00:11:53,190 --> 00:11:56,960
this secret may never have been disclosed.

134
00:11:59,900 --> 00:12:01,440
Let's go.

135
00:12:04,939 --> 00:12:09,819
It's possible that my dad brought you to me in a spirit.

136
00:12:09,819 --> 00:12:11,739
Sounds creepy.

137
00:12:11,739 --> 00:12:15,620
So don't bully me, my dad is watching.

138
00:12:15,620 --> 00:12:18,259
Then I believe Uncle was a sensible person.

139
00:12:18,259 --> 00:12:21,640
If you do something wrong, you must take responsibility.

140
00:12:22,579 --> 00:12:26,478
Let's go. You said you'd cook for me back at the clinic?

141
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:29,400
Coax you with food.

142
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:40,900
Can your SUV hold my bike?

143
00:12:40,900 --> 00:12:42,679
It should be okay.

144
00:12:53,740 --> 00:12:55,960
What're you doing?

145
00:12:55,960 --> 00:12:57,700
Showing my love.

146
00:12:57,700 --> 00:13:00,979
Can't you be more reserved? Don't interfere with my driving.

147
00:13:00,979 --> 00:13:03,319
Am I no longer attractive to you?

148
00:13:03,319 --> 00:13:06,259
How can you be this calm?

149
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:11,021
Don't provoke me. I'm not so easy to chase.

150
00:13:11,499 --> 00:13:15,899
Are you gonna sleep at the infusion room tonight?

151
00:13:17,059 --> 00:13:21,058
No, I'll sleep in your room, and you sleep with Director.

152
00:13:21,058 --> 00:13:23,919
They all know our relationship now.

153
00:13:23,919 --> 00:13:28,520
I'm sure they'll think something's wrong with you.

154
00:13:33,880 --> 00:13:37,740
Did you... bring that thing from your nightstand?

155
00:13:37,740 --> 00:13:39,900
In my nightstand?

156
00:13:43,080 --> 00:13:44,640
No.

157
00:13:45,500 --> 00:13:46,479
I don't believe it.

158
00:13:46,479 --> 00:13:48,640
I really didn't.

159
00:13:51,039 --> 00:13:56,359
Ye Shilan, I hear that you think that I am pretending to be reserved but am actually thinking about this kind of thing in my heart.

160
00:13:56,359 --> 00:13:59,218
- Aren't you?
- Of course not.

161
00:14:01,626 --> 00:14:03,831
I was happy for nothing.

162
00:14:04,740 --> 00:14:07,798
There you go. You can even tease me.

163
00:14:17,479 --> 00:14:19,200
Be careful.

164
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:24,779
It's hard work to get up so early and drive here.

165
00:14:24,779 --> 00:14:27,383
Take a nap. I'll make dinner and wake you when it's ready.

166
00:14:27,383 --> 00:14:29,060
Okay.

167
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:35,219
I'll go now.

168
00:14:35,219 --> 00:14:36,919
Go ahead.

169
00:14:41,519 --> 00:14:44,419
I haven't seen you for so many days.

170
00:14:44,419 --> 00:14:47,719
Can I kiss you one more time?

171
00:14:51,300 --> 00:14:53,559
You want to kiss me?

172
00:14:57,240 --> 00:15:01,425
As if I was asleep you kissed me secretly and I don't know.

173
00:15:34,980 --> 00:15:38,060
I think the boss is frank,

174
00:15:38,060 --> 00:15:40,439
but the price is a bit high.

175
00:15:40,439 --> 00:15:44,320
However, his equipment is good and worth the price.

176
00:15:45,259 --> 00:15:47,499
I can't decide.

177
00:15:48,059 --> 00:15:50,306
If you approve of the style of his entire cafe,

178
00:15:50,306 --> 00:15:53,038
and can open it for business with slight modifications,

179
00:15:53,038 --> 00:15:57,039
you'll save some time and cost on renovations.

180
00:15:57,039 --> 00:16:01,700
You are right. I'll think about it.

181
00:16:05,459 --> 00:16:07,999
You just said...

182
00:16:09,100 --> 00:16:13,800
Did you know Lu Zhaoxi went to Taoyuan Village for Yezi?

183
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:16,478
How are they doing now?

184
00:16:16,478 --> 00:16:21,980
What else can happen? The young lovers have fun with each other and adjust their tastes.

185
00:16:24,459 --> 00:16:25,900
You just said...

186
00:16:25,900 --> 00:16:27,140
You...

187
00:16:27,140 --> 00:16:29,019
It's yours.

188
00:16:35,100 --> 00:16:39,739
Good news. A company has decided to buy the copyright of one of your books.

189
00:16:39,739 --> 00:16:42,079
It's the company's boss's decision.

190
00:16:42,079 --> 00:16:44,079
Really?

191
00:16:44,079 --> 00:16:45,199
Indeed.

192
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:46,458
Can I look at your phone?

193
00:16:46,458 --> 00:16:48,139
Of course.

194
00:16:57,220 --> 00:16:58,598
I'm going to be famous!

195
00:16:58,599 --> 00:17:01,799
Finally, I'm going to be famous! I'm going to be famous!

196
00:17:01,799 --> 00:17:04,260
Thank you!

197
00:17:04,839 --> 00:17:07,430
What were you trying to say?

198
00:17:10,119 --> 00:17:12,579
I meant to say...

199
00:17:14,420 --> 00:17:16,359
I like you, too.

200
00:17:43,320 --> 00:17:47,999
Here's the chicken you fed. Have some more.

201
00:17:47,999 --> 00:17:51,759
Did he pay for your 300-yuan chicken per piece?

202
00:17:51,759 --> 00:17:54,359
Yes, it wasn't much.

203
00:17:54,359 --> 00:17:57,139
As his assistant, I paid it all back.

204
00:17:57,139 --> 00:17:58,603
Why didn't I know?

205
00:17:58,603 --> 00:18:00,869
Of course, you didn't know it since you don't read the account book.

206
00:18:00,869 --> 00:18:03,259
That's because I believe in you.

207
00:18:03,259 --> 00:18:05,710
It won't do. I will pass it on to you now.

208
00:18:05,710 --> 00:18:06,700
I'm not charging you.

209
00:18:06,700 --> 00:18:08,799
You have to charge me.

210
00:18:08,799 --> 00:18:12,819
Wake up. You're no longer the president.

211
00:18:12,819 --> 00:18:16,720
Here at Taoyuan Village, I'm the boss.

212
00:18:19,060 --> 00:18:24,579
Lu, if time permits, stay here for a few more days.

213
00:18:25,619 --> 00:18:29,319
Director, this was my plan actually.

214
00:18:30,420 --> 00:18:31,960
How long do you plan to stay?

215
00:18:31,960 --> 00:18:33,860
Are you happy?

216
00:18:34,900 --> 00:18:36,836
I don't have time to play with you all the time.

217
00:18:36,837 --> 00:18:38,120
No need.

218
00:18:38,120 --> 00:18:40,432
From today onwards, you will work as usual.

219
00:18:40,432 --> 00:18:42,880
I'll be your assistant.

220
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:45,299
That's a good idea.

221
00:18:45,299 --> 00:18:48,940
Let’s talk about food and shelter first, but no salary.

222
00:18:48,940 --> 00:18:50,719
Whatever.

223
00:18:53,039 --> 00:18:57,280
By the way, I will take you out for a bike ride this afternoon.

224
00:18:57,280 --> 00:18:59,240
Bike?

225
00:18:59,685 --> 00:19:01,768
I can't ride it.

226
00:19:10,520 --> 00:19:12,430
You can't ride a bike.

227
00:19:12,439 --> 00:19:14,198
How unbelievable!

228
00:19:14,199 --> 00:19:16,919
I was taught it when I was a kid, I just didn't learn it.

229
00:19:16,920 --> 00:19:20,075
Well, today let Miss Ye give you a lesson.

230
00:19:20,875 --> 00:19:24,120
Okay, Miss Ye. Is there any tricks?

231
00:19:24,120 --> 00:19:26,179
No tricks actually.

232
00:19:26,179 --> 00:19:29,389
Relax and ride, I will support you from behind.

233
00:19:30,859 --> 00:19:33,498
If you feel like you're going to fall, use your feet for support.

234
00:19:33,498 --> 00:19:35,320
Okay.

235
00:19:35,320 --> 00:19:37,140
Slow down.

236
00:19:39,859 --> 00:19:41,920
Go straight.

237
00:19:43,279 --> 00:19:45,079
Be careful.

238
00:19:48,739 --> 00:19:50,500
Slowly.

239
00:19:50,500 --> 00:19:53,015
Don't hold me up. Don't hurt your hands.

240
00:19:53,015 --> 00:19:54,719
I can use my feet.

241
00:19:54,719 --> 00:19:57,319
Okay, just make sure to pay attention.

242
00:20:14,959 --> 00:20:17,919
It's too much work for you to ride like this.

243
00:20:18,580 --> 00:20:20,639
Are you laughing at me?

244
00:20:20,639 --> 00:20:23,859
I didn't expect you to be so stupid.

245
00:20:23,859 --> 00:20:29,420
Come on, let Miss Ye ride around to show you.

246
00:20:29,420 --> 00:20:34,179
No problem. Miss Ye, show time.

247
00:20:35,219 --> 00:20:37,000
Watch closely.

248
00:20:55,880 --> 00:20:57,660
Bravo!

249
00:20:57,660 --> 00:21:00,059
Taoyuan Village Bike Master!

250
00:21:01,060 --> 00:21:02,339
Did you notice?

251
00:21:02,339 --> 00:21:05,040
Don't hold the handlebar tightly.

252
00:21:05,040 --> 00:21:08,619
As long as you master the balance of your body, the handlebar will not be crooked so easily.

253
00:21:08,619 --> 00:21:11,219
It's easy for you to say.

254
00:21:11,219 --> 00:21:13,240
Well, let me have another try.

255
00:21:13,240 --> 00:21:14,987
Come on.

256
00:21:20,139 --> 00:21:22,159
Keep balance.

257
00:21:22,159 --> 00:21:23,779
Hold the handlebar.

258
00:21:23,779 --> 00:21:25,170
Look forward.

259
00:21:25,170 --> 00:21:27,040
Don't use your feet too much.

260
00:21:27,040 --> 00:21:29,619
Try to find balance while riding.

261
00:21:29,619 --> 00:21:31,240
Okay.

262
00:21:31,240 --> 00:21:33,040
I'll go.

263
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:38,859
I seem to have figured it out.

264
00:21:38,859 --> 00:21:40,059
Yeah, that's it.

265
00:21:40,059 --> 00:21:41,099
Continue.

266
00:21:41,099 --> 00:21:44,020
Practice makes perfect.

267
00:21:44,020 --> 00:21:46,320
Riding faster will make it more stable.

268
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:48,220
Why can't I control the speed?

269
00:21:48,220 --> 00:21:51,699
Slow down!

270
00:21:52,620 --> 00:21:55,818
What's wrong with you? How can you ride this way?

271
00:21:55,818 --> 00:21:57,199
Granny, I'm so sorry.

272
00:21:57,199 --> 00:21:59,228
How much is this? I'll pay for it.

273
00:21:59,228 --> 00:22:01,638
How're you? Are you injured?

274
00:22:01,638 --> 00:22:05,620
I'm fine, but I crushed Granny's vegetables.

275
00:22:05,620 --> 00:22:06,779
Granny Wang.

276
00:22:06,779 --> 00:22:10,279
Dr. Ye. Dr. Ye, who's he?

277
00:22:10,279 --> 00:22:13,559
He's my boyfriend, he is practicing riding.

278
00:22:13,559 --> 00:22:17,100
Sorry to have crushed your vegetables. I'll pay for them.

279
00:22:17,100 --> 00:22:18,710
Your boyfriend?

280
00:22:18,710 --> 00:22:20,770
Never mind. Just some vegetables.

281
00:22:20,779 --> 00:22:24,040
Last time, you saved my kid's life.

282
00:22:24,040 --> 00:22:27,158
Not that serious. Just a tiny favor.

283
00:22:27,158 --> 00:22:32,559
How can that be? I've heard that the peanuts that get stuck in the throat can kill you.

284
00:22:32,559 --> 00:22:36,198
Go play. Later on, I'll pick and cook the vegetables myself.

285
00:22:36,198 --> 00:22:37,380
- Sorry, Granny.
- Go.

286
00:22:37,380 --> 00:22:38,438
- Go ahead.
- So sorry.

287
00:22:38,439 --> 00:22:40,280
Go ahead.

288
00:22:43,580 --> 00:22:45,539
Shouldn't we pay Grandma back?

289
00:22:45,539 --> 00:22:47,360
I feel so sorry.

290
00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:49,360
Granny Wang won't take it.

291
00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:52,339
I'll buy some fruit for her later.

292
00:22:55,460 --> 00:22:57,720
Aren't you still angry with me?

293
00:22:57,720 --> 00:22:59,859
Why're you so nice to me?

294
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:05,859
I feel like being your boyfriend is pretty cool.

295
00:23:05,859 --> 00:23:08,959
So my heart is a little shaken.

296
00:23:08,959 --> 00:23:12,020
Pretty good. Improvement.

297
00:23:13,420 --> 00:23:15,900
You're like a fish in water here.

298
00:23:15,900 --> 00:23:17,839
I just learn from Deputy Director

299
00:23:17,839 --> 00:23:20,919
how to get along with the villagers here.

300
00:23:20,919 --> 00:23:25,720
Besides, do you know why Deputy Director stays here?

301
00:23:25,720 --> 00:23:27,439
Why?

302
00:23:27,439 --> 00:23:29,780
Su told me that

303
00:23:29,780 --> 00:23:32,959
Deputy Director's wife passed away years ago.

304
00:23:32,959 --> 00:23:35,439
He can't let go.

305
00:23:35,439 --> 00:23:39,060
Director by chance went for a check-up at his hospital.

306
00:23:39,060 --> 00:23:41,099
The two met by chance.

307
00:23:41,099 --> 00:23:43,953
She advised him to come here for relaxation.

308
00:23:43,953 --> 00:23:47,159
Deputy Director in the process of helping others

309
00:23:47,160 --> 00:23:51,211
found the hope of life again, so he decided to stay here.

310
00:23:53,780 --> 00:23:58,759
To live positively is the best tribute to the deceased.

311
00:23:59,739 --> 00:24:01,220
That's it.

312
00:24:02,180 --> 00:24:04,199
Next time when I go back home,

313
00:24:04,199 --> 00:24:06,919
I'll visit my dad's grave

314
00:24:06,919 --> 00:24:09,659
and report my life to him.

315
00:24:09,659 --> 00:24:11,060
Do you want to take me with you?

316
00:24:11,060 --> 00:24:12,560
Of course.

317
00:24:12,560 --> 00:24:15,800
You're the highlight of my life.

318
00:24:20,919 --> 00:24:25,039
Ye Shilan, are you satisfied with your current life?

319
00:24:25,039 --> 00:24:26,680
Yes!

320
00:24:27,380 --> 00:24:32,539
And I realize I've changed a lot since I met you.

321
00:24:33,180 --> 00:24:35,220
What has changed?

322
00:24:35,220 --> 00:24:39,180
For example, my relationship with my colleagues has become more harmonious.

323
00:24:39,180 --> 00:24:43,180
I found out that co-workers don't have to be good friends,

324
00:24:43,180 --> 00:24:46,200
but we can be good colleagues.

325
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:51,759
Another example, I feel that I am more confident, lively, and cheerful now.

326
00:24:51,759 --> 00:24:55,379
And I'm willing to share my life with you without reservation.

327
00:24:56,619 --> 00:24:59,119
This time at Taoyuan Village,

328
00:24:59,119 --> 00:25:04,000
I feel more at ease than before.

329
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:08,280
I do enjoy and love my work.

330
00:25:08,280 --> 00:25:10,580
I'm working step by step,

331
00:25:10,580 --> 00:25:13,279
not in a rush to buy a house.

332
00:25:14,520 --> 00:25:16,859
It seems I'm important to you.

333
00:25:16,859 --> 00:25:19,239
Of course, you're important.

334
00:25:19,239 --> 00:25:23,257
So I'll hold you tightly and not let you go.

335
00:25:26,220 --> 00:25:30,858
By the way, the photo of a sea of flowers you sent me is beautiful.

336
00:25:30,858 --> 00:25:32,098
Take me to see it later.

337
00:25:32,098 --> 00:25:33,460
Okay.

338
00:25:33,460 --> 00:25:36,932
After I change my shoes at the clinic, I'll take you there.

339
00:25:37,820 --> 00:25:39,780
Your shoes are cleaned.

340
00:25:40,499 --> 00:25:43,019
Do you want to wash your feet too?

341
00:25:43,019 --> 00:25:45,160
Okay. Will you wash them for me?

342
00:25:45,160 --> 00:25:46,759
Who is afraid of whom, come on!

343
00:25:46,760 --> 00:25:47,780
I'm kidding.

344
00:25:47,780 --> 00:25:49,258
Kidding? I'm serious. Don't be shy.

345
00:25:49,258 --> 00:25:49,920
Don't be shy.

346
00:25:49,921 --> 00:25:51,358
I quit. Sorry.

347
00:25:51,359 --> 00:25:54,338
Just do it. Let me do it for you.

348
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:57,300
- Have a try.
- I'll push you in.

349
00:25:57,319 --> 00:25:59,180
Your popcorn is ready.

350
00:25:59,180 --> 00:26:00,979
And two cokes.

351
00:26:04,180 --> 00:26:06,718
Two cups of coke. Your meal is ready. Please take care.

352
00:26:06,718 --> 00:26:08,139
Thanks.

353
00:26:09,660 --> 00:26:10,978
Let's sit over there.

354
00:26:10,978 --> 00:26:12,379
Okay.

355
00:26:16,780 --> 00:26:18,200
Delicious?

356
00:26:27,580 --> 00:26:28,940
Here.

357
00:26:32,780 --> 00:26:35,420
Before, why didn't you confess after so long?

358
00:26:35,420 --> 00:26:37,657
Were you waiting for me to take the initiative?

359
00:26:37,657 --> 00:26:41,819
No, it's because I didn't think about it.

360
00:26:41,819 --> 00:26:43,819
Didn't think about it?

361
00:26:43,819 --> 00:26:46,259
I read so many confession plots you wrote.

362
00:26:46,259 --> 00:26:49,219
I always hoped to come up with something special.

363
00:26:49,219 --> 00:26:51,125
Otherwise, I was afraid you wouldn't be surprised.

364
00:26:51,125 --> 00:26:53,700
But I couldn't think of one.

365
00:26:54,859 --> 00:26:57,920
A novel is a novel and I am me.

366
00:26:57,920 --> 00:27:02,099
As long as you are sincere and caring, I will like it.

367
00:27:02,099 --> 00:27:03,380
Yeah.

368
00:27:03,380 --> 00:27:06,180
I didn't expect to be preempted by you.

369
00:27:07,039 --> 00:27:10,420
So did you like my confession today?

370
00:27:10,420 --> 00:27:13,879
Surprisingly, I liked it very much.

371
00:27:13,879 --> 00:27:17,219
You have to be mentally prepared to date me.

372
00:27:17,219 --> 00:27:19,899
If I'm not careful, I'll write details into the novel.

373
00:27:19,899 --> 00:27:21,360
No problem.

374
00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:23,839
As long as it's not about Kevin.

375
00:27:23,839 --> 00:27:27,379
Certainly not. I am also embarrassed seeing it myself.

376
00:27:29,019 --> 00:27:32,459
Now I can't wait to change the name of the character.

377
00:27:32,459 --> 00:27:35,240
How long will it take to finish this one?

378
00:27:35,240 --> 00:27:36,999
About one month.

379
00:27:36,999 --> 00:27:41,080
Then I'll write about the president and his assistant.

380
00:27:41,739 --> 00:27:43,138
Does Dr. Ye agree?

381
00:27:43,138 --> 00:27:46,979
I already told her about it. And she's used to it.

382
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:51,420
I just thought of a great name for the novel.

383
00:27:51,420 --> 00:27:53,080
Tell me.

384
00:27:53,080 --> 00:27:57,599
Yezi sent me a WeChat message saying that Lu Zhaoxi planned to stay in Taoyuan Village for a while longer.

385
00:27:57,599 --> 00:28:01,119
I suddenly got inspiration. The title will be...

386
00:28:01,119 --> 00:28:04,279
"Today the President Doesn't Want to Work."

387
00:28:04,279 --> 00:28:08,280
President doesn't want to go to work and just wants to fall in love.

388
00:28:08,280 --> 00:28:10,139
Is this what you mean?

389
00:28:11,180 --> 00:28:13,379
Sure enough, you understand me very well.

390
00:28:28,619 --> 00:28:31,039
I just made a decision.

391
00:28:31,039 --> 00:28:32,600
What decision?

392
00:28:32,600 --> 00:28:38,400
I decided to share with my colleagues that I like reading your types of novels.

393
00:28:38,439 --> 00:28:39,780
Why?

394
00:28:39,780 --> 00:28:42,040
I used to be embarrassed.

395
00:28:42,040 --> 00:28:44,379
In fact, I was narrow-minded.

396
00:28:44,379 --> 00:28:48,280
Besides, I should support my girlfriend's career.

397
00:28:48,280 --> 00:28:50,326
How can I be embarrassed about it?

398
00:28:54,920 --> 00:28:57,280
I support your decision.

399
00:28:57,280 --> 00:28:59,819
I'll take it as your first gift for me.

400
00:28:59,819 --> 00:29:01,540
Does that count?

401
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:06,620
It's about time.

402
00:29:06,620 --> 00:29:08,539
Let's go. The show is about to begin.

403
00:29:08,539 --> 00:29:09,740
Okay.

404
00:29:14,160 --> 00:29:15,540
Let's go.

405
00:29:19,660 --> 00:29:22,139
I thought I can get there by walking.

406
00:29:22,139 --> 00:29:23,579
We can.

407
00:29:23,579 --> 00:29:27,108
But I'm afraid we'll miss the best scenery if we're a bit late.

408
00:29:27,108 --> 00:29:29,599
Let me ride. It may be faster.

409
00:29:29,599 --> 00:29:31,218
You can't even ride on your own.

410
00:29:31,218 --> 00:29:34,119
Still want to take the two of us into the ditch together?

411
00:29:35,060 --> 00:29:37,500
Actually, I can also drive there.

412
00:29:37,500 --> 00:29:38,660
No need.

413
00:29:38,660 --> 00:29:40,762
Let me give you a ride.

414
00:29:41,979 --> 00:29:43,960
Looking down upon my car?

415
00:29:44,900 --> 00:29:46,339
Get on.

416
00:29:46,339 --> 00:29:48,600
♫ <i>Shubi duba</i> ♫

417
00:29:48,600 --> 00:29:50,380
♫ <i>Shubi du</i> ♫

418
00:29:51,099 --> 00:29:53,079
Hold at my waist.

419
00:29:54,440 --> 00:29:55,939
♫ <i>Shubi duba baba</i> ♫

420
00:29:55,939 --> 00:29:57,279
Let's go.

421
00:30:01,500 --> 00:30:03,499
♫ <i>Fix my shirt collar</i> ♫

422
00:30:03,500 --> 00:30:08,020
♫ <i>Prepare to take your first hug every morning</i> ♫

423
00:30:08,860 --> 00:30:11,659
♫ <i>The air is filled with wonderful music</i> ♫

424
00:30:11,659 --> 00:30:17,020
♫ <i>A naughty trick is a sweet antidote</i> ♫

425
00:30:17,880 --> 00:30:23,019
♫ <i>You're so beautiful, you're so beautiful, yeah</i> ♫

426
00:30:23,020 --> 00:30:26,800
♫ <i>I'm trapped in your world and have nowhere to escape</i> ♫

427
00:30:26,800 --> 00:30:31,139
♫ <i>Beautiful, you're so beautiful, my baby</i> ♫

428
00:30:31,140 --> 00:30:36,160
♫ <i>Looking forward to the next surprising heartbeat</i> ♫

429
00:30:36,160 --> 00:30:40,499
♫ <i>Se ludu, se dudu</i> ♫

430
00:30:40,500 --> 00:30:44,460
♫ <i>I can't help sniggering</i> ♫

431
00:30:44,460 --> 00:30:48,840
♫ <i>Se ludu, Se dudu</i> ♫

432
00:30:48,840 --> 00:30:52,080
♫ <i>Don't forget our pinky swear</i> ♫

433
00:31:02,139 --> 00:31:04,360
How do you learn about this place?

434
00:31:04,360 --> 00:31:06,179
A villager told me.

435
00:31:06,179 --> 00:31:07,977
Is it pretty?

436
00:31:07,977 --> 00:31:09,455
So beautiful.

437
00:31:19,259 --> 00:31:21,865
The last time I took a photo here and sent it to you,

438
00:31:21,865 --> 00:31:27,079
I thought that one day you will come to Taoyuan Village and I will bring you here to play.

439
00:31:27,079 --> 00:31:30,919
Then you said you wanted to see me, so I came.

440
00:31:30,919 --> 00:31:32,390
How do you feel?

441
00:31:33,379 --> 00:31:36,080
It's such a beautiful place.

442
00:31:36,080 --> 00:31:38,560
Feel a little more relaxed, right?

443
00:31:38,560 --> 00:31:39,840
I do.

444
00:31:39,840 --> 00:31:43,399
To be honest, this place is quite suitable for confession.

445
00:31:43,399 --> 00:31:45,008
Don't you think so?

446
00:31:46,219 --> 00:31:48,560
Do you want me to confess to you?

447
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:53,720
But I'm too inarticulate to say sweet words.

448
00:31:54,321 --> 00:31:55,939
What about chasing after me?

449
00:31:55,939 --> 00:31:57,219
Chase after you?

450
00:31:57,219 --> 00:31:59,740
Yeah, as long as you catch me,

451
00:31:59,740 --> 00:32:02,140
I'll reconsider being your boyfriend.

452
00:32:02,140 --> 00:32:05,098
- You mean it?
- Indeed.

453
00:32:05,098 --> 00:32:07,360
This soon?

454
00:32:07,360 --> 00:32:08,459
You're shameless.

455
00:32:08,459 --> 00:32:10,660
I can't wait.

456
00:32:10,660 --> 00:32:12,820
Slow down.

457
00:32:20,060 --> 00:32:21,919
What's wrong?

458
00:32:21,919 --> 00:32:23,600
I sprained my ankle.

459
00:32:24,259 --> 00:32:25,320
Does it hurt?

460
00:32:25,320 --> 00:32:26,960
Yes.

461
00:32:30,580 --> 00:32:33,239
It's too obvious that you're playing tricks.

462
00:32:34,420 --> 00:32:36,700
Can't you just cooperate with me?

463
00:32:37,780 --> 00:32:40,558
How can you sprain your ankle? Let me look.

464
00:32:40,558 --> 00:32:42,480
I got you.

465
00:32:44,900 --> 00:32:47,220
Are you still angry?

466
00:32:47,220 --> 00:32:49,369
To begin with, I was a bit angry,

467
00:32:49,369 --> 00:32:51,209
but I don't care anymore..

468
00:32:51,209 --> 00:32:53,804
Then you deliberately play against me.

469
00:32:53,804 --> 00:32:56,039
I couldn't leave and couldn't come to you,

470
00:32:56,039 --> 00:32:58,659
so I hoped you can coax me more.

471
00:32:58,659 --> 00:33:01,320
You still avoided me this morning when I was so active.

472
00:33:01,321 --> 00:33:02,701
It was also hard for me to endure.

473
00:33:02,701 --> 00:33:04,580
So why endure it?

474
00:33:08,780 --> 00:33:10,239
Wait a moment.

475
00:33:15,476 --> 00:33:18,250
Are you sure you don't want to part from me?

476
00:33:18,250 --> 00:33:19,600
I'm sure.

477
00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:20,899
Are you determined to be with me?

478
00:33:20,899 --> 00:33:22,540
I am.

479
00:33:23,970 --> 00:33:25,499
What a coincidence!

480
00:33:25,499 --> 00:33:27,239
I am determined to be with you.

481
00:33:30,560 --> 00:33:36,799
In fact, this place is perfect for a proposal.

482
00:33:40,700 --> 00:33:45,559
♫ <i>You are a part of my life</i> ♫

483
00:33:45,559 --> 00:33:48,699
♫ <i>You're my shining armor</i> ♫

484
00:33:48,699 --> 00:33:51,500
So you already had this planned?

485
00:33:51,500 --> 00:33:53,499
You're so bad.

486
00:33:54,460 --> 00:33:58,909
Ye Shilan, I don't want to be just your boyfriend,

487
00:33:58,909 --> 00:34:02,079
but also your fiancé. Can I?

488
00:34:02,920 --> 00:34:03,960
Yes!

00:35:22,819 --> 00:35:25,799
- Zhaoxi went to propose .
- Did it work?

501
00:35:25,799 --> 00:35:28,419
Of course. Look.

502
00:35:30,080 --> 00:35:33,840
Do you think they're a little too fast?

503
00:35:33,840 --> 00:35:37,800
As long as two people see each other right, it doesn't matter how long it takes.

504
00:35:37,800 --> 00:35:39,799
When I proposed marriage to you,

505
00:35:39,800 --> 00:35:42,860
you turned me down with this excuse.

506
00:35:42,860 --> 00:35:47,439
I regretted it soon, so I proposed to you.

507
00:35:48,460 --> 00:35:51,499
In fact, it doesn't matter which one takes the initiative.

508
00:35:51,499 --> 00:35:55,479
What matters is to be sure the other part is the right one.

So my idea may have helped them.

510

Let's drink tonight to celebrate?

511
00:36:02,919 --> 00:36:04,139
Great.

512
00:36:04,139 --> 00:36:06,419
I'll make some appetizers.

513

Three months.

00:36:25,020 --> 00:36:27,700
Lu Zhaoxi said he would stay with me for a while,

522
00:36:27,700 --> 00:36:29,454

It was my mom.

You're so positive for the first time.

533
00:37:05,520 --> 00:37:08,279
I'll be more active in the future.

534
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:14,200
In a while, I plan to post to WeChat to let my colleagues know.

535

Remember to close the door before going to bed.

I know.

542
00:37:36,220 --> 00:37:39,239
I'll go to bed. Rest early.

543
00:37:43,539 --> 00:37:45,239
Are you leaving?

544
00:37:45,940 --> 00:37:48,239
It's late now.

I mean... you don't have to go.

You didn't take that... Did you?

547

There's a pharmacy next door.

- You stole it?
- Of course not.

I bought it from Deputy Director.

552
00:38:14,520 --> 00:38:16,980
It's too obvious.

553
00:38:21,828 --> 00:38:24,925
I can't let Deputy Director think something's wrong with me,

554
00:38:25,900 --> 00:38:28,959
or disappoint you in vain. Right?

555
