<i>[Episode 08]</i>

16
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,799
Hello. Is it for Mr. Lu?

17
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:37,238
- Yeah.
- Thanks.

18
00:01:37,238 --> 00:01:39,878
<i>Hey, buddy. It's for you.</i>

19
00:01:40,519 --> 00:01:43,519
This guy really doesn't suffer at all.

20
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:00,359
Wait for me here.

21
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:01,819
Okay.

22
00:02:08,320 --> 00:02:09,800
<i>Come in.</i>

23
00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:15,560
President Lu?

24
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:17,360
Yes.

25
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:19,399
May I have your name?

26
00:02:19,399 --> 00:02:21,360
You don't know me?

27
00:02:25,939 --> 00:02:28,540
You must be an OB-GYN patient.

28
00:02:28,540 --> 00:02:30,500
VVIP.

29
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:33,179
- My family name is Ji.
- Hello, Miss Ji.

30
00:02:33,179 --> 00:02:35,439
You don't watch dramas or movies, right?

31
00:02:35,439 --> 00:02:37,659
I'm quite popular.

32
00:02:39,340 --> 00:02:41,359
Miss Ji, excuse me.

33
00:02:52,539 --> 00:02:54,958
Hello. Are you upstairs?

34
00:02:54,958 --> 00:02:56,739
I have a guest. Bring some warm water.

35
00:02:56,739 --> 00:02:59,179
<i>- Okay, no problem.</i>
- This is for you.

36
00:02:59,179 --> 00:03:01,039
President Lu,

37
00:03:01,700 --> 00:03:03,600
I'm an actress.

38
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:05,838
With my identity, I don't want to be seen by irrelevant people.

39
00:03:05,839 --> 00:03:07,899
Don't worry. She's my assistant.

40
00:03:07,899 --> 00:03:11,179
Miss Ji, how can I help you?

41
00:03:12,199 --> 00:03:15,840
- I heard that your hospital is going to make a documentary.
- Yes.

42
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:20,639
Because it's related to my privacy, I'd like to see your filming schedule first.

43
00:03:20,639 --> 00:03:22,420
No problem.

44
00:03:27,679 --> 00:03:29,080
Here.

45
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:35,979
<i>She's a celebrity pregnant woman. I do not recognize her.</i>

46
00:03:35,979 --> 00:03:38,540
<i>She seems is a little angry.</i>

47
00:03:41,220 --> 00:03:43,999
I hope that you will stop this plan.

48
00:03:43,999 --> 00:03:45,159
Why?

49
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:47,980
I haven't announced to the public that I'm married and pregnant.

50
00:03:47,980 --> 00:03:51,719
I chose Anxing Hospital because it can protect the privacy of its patients.

51
00:03:51,719 --> 00:03:56,010
And for my privacy, we've signed an extra special contract.

52
00:03:56,010 --> 00:03:57,719
Miss Ji, don't worry.

53
00:03:57,720 --> 00:04:01,099
Our hospital will protect our patients' privacy just like usual.

54
00:04:01,099 --> 00:04:04,432
But shooting in the hospital, so many people will be involved.

55
00:04:04,433 --> 00:04:07,840
Now anyone can post anything on the internet.

56
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:10,019
How can I rest assured?

57
00:04:10,019 --> 00:04:13,800
Besides, in case something goes wrong,

58
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:16,139
you can't do anything. Right?

59
00:04:16,139 --> 00:04:19,950
And I have my own plan going public.

60
00:04:19,950 --> 00:04:22,200
Miss Ji, I also understand your concerns.

61
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:24,980
If you really can't accept it,

62
00:04:24,980 --> 00:04:27,600
I can arrange to change you to a partnering hospital.

63
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:28,759
Is that okay for you?

64
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:30,699
Why do I have to change hospitals?

65
00:04:30,699 --> 00:04:33,780
Our family also owns shares in Anxing Hospital.

66
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:38,020
You are the daughter-in-law of Director Zhang?

67
00:04:38,020 --> 00:04:39,679
That's right.

68
00:04:43,739 --> 00:04:45,259
Come in.

69
00:04:58,399 --> 00:05:01,659
You are Miss Ji?

70
00:05:03,359 --> 00:05:04,760
You know me?

71
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:06,179
Of course.

72
00:05:06,179 --> 00:05:08,620
I'm your fan.

73
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:12,300
Miss Ji, drink some water.

74
00:05:12,300 --> 00:05:14,238
I watched your movie "The Tale of the Red Fish" before.

75
00:05:14,239 --> 00:05:18,078
You played two roles in it. One is smart and lovely.

76
00:05:18,079 --> 00:05:19,620
The other is attractive and gorgeous.

77
00:05:19,620 --> 00:05:21,320
It's really good.

78
00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:24,030
That movie made me cry a lot.

79
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:27,118
It was released ten years ago.

80
00:05:27,119 --> 00:05:29,979
And last year, the drama, "Rose Garden,"

81
00:05:29,979 --> 00:05:33,740
I remember it ranked No.1 in viewer ratings, right?

82
00:05:33,740 --> 00:05:35,640
That's right!

83
00:05:35,640 --> 00:05:37,420
So happy you liked it.

84
00:05:37,420 --> 00:05:41,359
Miss Ji, later, would you mind giving me an autograph?

85
00:05:41,359 --> 00:05:42,599
I can do it for you.

86
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:44,040
Thanks a lot.

87
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:46,940
I've been a big fan of yours for a long time.

88
00:05:53,500 --> 00:06:00,200
President Lu, about the documentary, please give me, a VVIP, a satisfying reply, as soon as possible.

89
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:02,019
No problem

90
00:06:03,079 --> 00:06:04,660
Looking forward to your upcoming movies.

91
00:06:04,660 --> 00:06:06,179
Goodbye.

92
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:18,679
Are you really a big fan of hers?

93
00:06:18,679 --> 00:06:19,900
Of course not.

94
00:06:19,900 --> 00:06:22,899
When I read through important documents, her information was in them.

95
00:06:22,899 --> 00:06:25,439
So I just kept them in mind.

96
00:06:25,439 --> 00:06:27,700
You are a great actress.

97
00:06:27,700 --> 00:06:29,958
This is what Deputy Director taught me.

98
00:06:29,959 --> 00:06:32,339
There must be skill in speaking and doing things.

99
00:06:32,339 --> 00:06:34,900
You sent me a message, saying she was unhappy.

100
00:06:34,900 --> 00:06:37,400
I guessed you wanted me to coax her a bit, right?

101
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:40,759
Just think about it. This female star was recognized

102
00:06:40,760 --> 00:06:43,238
and praised for her good acting skills, popularity, and professionalism.

103
00:06:43,239 --> 00:06:45,039
Of course she'd be happy.

104
00:06:46,859 --> 00:06:50,679
Why didn't I notice that you were so clever?

105
00:06:50,679 --> 00:06:53,759
You thought I was stupid?

106
00:06:54,859 --> 00:06:57,859
Who regarded me as a medicinal liquor seller?

107
00:06:58,540 --> 00:07:01,299
About what happened before, we agreed to forget it all.

108
00:07:01,299 --> 00:07:03,660
So I can't mention it anymore?

109
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:14,660
Working with you, if I'm not smart, I'll be in big trouble.

110
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:21,400
About Miss Ji, what's your plan?

111
00:07:22,060 --> 00:07:23,560
No plan.

112
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:26,380
As she is pregnant, I don't want her to be angry.

113
00:07:26,380 --> 00:07:28,540
Or I would have rejected her directly.

114
00:07:29,320 --> 00:07:33,139
By the original plan to make the documentary, they are supposed to talk with the pregnant mothers next week.

115
00:07:33,139 --> 00:07:36,900
It's most likely that someone secretly got the word out.

116
00:07:37,780 --> 00:07:39,520
That's okay.

117
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:42,410
I hate being led by the nose by others.

118
00:07:50,940 --> 00:07:52,859
Do you have other concerns?

119
00:07:53,679 --> 00:07:55,779
Now, Director Zhang is involved.

120
00:07:55,779 --> 00:07:59,978
Asking Miss Ji to make trouble won't be all that they want. It won't be so simple.

121
00:07:59,978 --> 00:08:01,279
So?

122
00:08:01,279 --> 00:08:03,118
When you were appointed to be president,

123
00:08:03,119 --> 00:08:04,558
I was still working in the group.

124
00:08:04,559 --> 00:08:06,439
Not all the directors agreed with the appointment.

125
00:08:06,440 --> 00:08:09,140
It was Old President Lu who insisted and made a decision.

126
00:08:09,140 --> 00:08:11,340
If we don't solve this properly,

127
00:08:11,340 --> 00:08:13,920
your position might be influenced.

128
00:08:18,220 --> 00:08:20,739
This is the first time I've heard of it.

129
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:24,060
Influence is just influence, right?

130
00:08:24,060 --> 00:08:26,670
Was it my idea to get this position?

131
00:08:27,380 --> 00:08:29,200
Don't worry.

132
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:31,993
Just carry out the documentary schedule as was our original plan.

133
00:08:31,993 --> 00:08:33,459
Okay.

134
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:39,860
<i>[President's Office]</i>

135
00:08:51,799 --> 00:08:54,520
<i>Are you stupid?</i>

136
00:08:54,520 --> 00:08:57,559
<i>Lu Zhaoxi came to be the president of our hospital simply to build up his resume.</i>

137
00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:00,900
<i>Then he'll stand up and leave but you'll still be here.</i>

138
00:09:00,920 --> 00:09:05,239
<i>After you offended Chief Huang, what good can you get from this?</i>

139
00:09:11,540 --> 00:09:12,558
Hello? How can I help you?

140
00:09:12,559 --> 00:09:14,679
<i>- Is it Assistant Ye?</i>
- Yeah.

141
00:09:14,679 --> 00:09:17,079
<i>Your mother is here. You didn't answer your phone.</i>

142
00:09:17,079 --> 00:09:19,440
<i>She is at the front desk now.</i>

143
00:09:20,140 --> 00:09:23,019
Tell her to wait for five minutes.

144
00:09:23,019 --> 00:09:24,579
Okay.

145
00:09:24,579 --> 00:09:25,798
I'll tell her.

146
00:09:25,799 --> 00:09:27,639
Okay.

147
00:09:27,639 --> 00:09:30,119
Please wait a moment. Assistant Ye will be here soon.

148
00:09:30,119 --> 00:09:32,180
Thank you.

149
00:09:32,180 --> 00:09:34,759
Just now you called her Assistant Ye?

150
00:09:34,760 --> 00:09:38,100
Dr. Ye has now been transferred to be the assistant to the president.

151
00:09:39,699 --> 00:09:41,532
Then, does she do doctor's work?

152
00:09:41,532 --> 00:09:44,380
Maybe... she doesn't.

153
00:09:44,380 --> 00:09:47,140
How can a doctor not treat patients?

154
00:09:47,140 --> 00:09:48,560
Then, will she go back to the pediatrics?

155
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:51,179
I don't know that.

156
00:09:51,179 --> 00:09:53,080
Chief Huang.

157
00:09:53,860 --> 00:09:55,400
Okay.

158
00:09:56,039 --> 00:09:58,699
- What's wrong?
- It's Ye Shilan's mother.

159
00:09:58,699 --> 00:10:00,478
This is Chief Huang of Pediatrics.

160
00:10:00,479 --> 00:10:03,619
If you have any questions, he can answer you.

161
00:10:03,619 --> 00:10:05,899
Hello, Chief Huang.

162
00:10:05,899 --> 00:10:07,399
About Ye Shilan's position,

163
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:10,279
right now, she's only working as an assistant temporarily.

164
00:10:10,280 --> 00:10:13,320
Later, she'll be back to Pediatrics.

165
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:14,639
That's great.

166
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:18,830
Thanks, Chief Huang, please take care of Lanlan.

167
00:10:18,830 --> 00:10:20,639
Yeah, of course.

168
00:10:20,639 --> 00:10:21,839
Right.

169
00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:25,319
These are some pecans I brought here from my hometown.

170
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:27,439
I originally wanted Lanlan to give them to you.

171
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:30,460
Now I have met you here, please accept them.

172
00:10:30,460 --> 00:10:31,558
It's a small gift.

173
00:10:31,559 --> 00:10:33,659
Well. Okay.

174
00:10:33,659 --> 00:10:35,439
It's a small gift.

175
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:37,059
I won't reject it.

176
00:10:37,059 --> 00:10:39,179
Zhang, please put this here.

177
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:42,560
I'll get it later. I'll share them with her colleagues.

178
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:43,678
Yeah, great.

179
00:10:43,679 --> 00:10:45,000
I have to go back to work.

180
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,420
Thanks.

181
00:10:58,740 --> 00:11:02,359
President Lu, is it okay for me to leave earlier today? For personal reasons.

182
00:11:02,359 --> 00:11:03,860
Okay, we can get downstairs together.

183
00:11:03,860 --> 00:11:05,320
Thanks.

184
00:11:07,839 --> 00:11:09,479
Let's go.

185
00:11:35,340 --> 00:11:38,080
<i>It's not like we're a couple.</i>

186
00:11:43,220 --> 00:11:44,759
<i>Sorry.</i>

187
00:11:44,759 --> 00:11:47,840
<i>My mom... She...</i>

188
00:11:53,560 --> 00:11:56,839
<i>Mom, it was taken several days ago,</i>

189
00:11:56,839 --> 00:12:01,200
<i> when he was tired from work. Taken during a break.</i>

190
00:12:09,939 --> 00:12:11,640
It's dirty.

191
00:12:11,640 --> 00:12:13,320
Please.

192
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:37,240
<i>They will see each other.</i>

193
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:40,900
<i>Shall I tell the truth?</i>

194
00:12:42,220 --> 00:12:43,840
President Lu.

195
00:12:46,540 --> 00:12:49,278
Would you mind going back to work for a while?

196
00:12:49,278 --> 00:12:52,380
What? Do you think that I'm not working hard?

197
00:12:52,380 --> 00:12:54,259
No.

198
00:12:54,259 --> 00:12:58,859
I just think that I'm not in the office, what if someone comes to visit you?

199
00:12:58,859 --> 00:13:01,139
I already have plans with Assistant Lin.

200
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:21,420
President Lu, do you need to go to the restroom?

201
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:26,619
I'm worried that there will be heavy traffic.

202
00:13:26,619 --> 00:13:28,760
A full bladder is not good for your health.

203
00:13:29,459 --> 00:13:32,499
Are you treating me like your little patients?

204
00:13:33,420 --> 00:13:35,420
Addicted to being a doctor?

205
00:13:39,259 --> 00:13:42,180
Please don't meet my mom. Please don't meet my mom.

206
00:14:00,019 --> 00:14:02,279
- Lanlan.
- Mom.

207
00:14:02,280 --> 00:14:04,032
Mom, where did you go?

208
00:14:04,032 --> 00:14:06,373
I went to the restroom.

209
00:14:06,373 --> 00:14:08,079
What brings you here?

210
00:14:08,079 --> 00:14:09,659
Wei's mom is at the hospital. Everything is okay.

211
00:14:09,659 --> 00:14:12,860
And it's not far from your hospital, so I came to see you.

212
00:14:12,860 --> 00:14:14,499
Do you need to go back?

213
00:14:14,499 --> 00:14:16,280
No. Wei is taking care of her.

214
00:14:16,280 --> 00:14:19,039
I'll take his shift tomorrow morning.

215
00:14:19,039 --> 00:14:20,619
- Let me take it.
- It's okay.

216
00:14:20,619 --> 00:14:21,920
- Are you tired?
- Not at all.

217
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:24,698
I want to stay with you tonight. Is that okay?

218
00:14:24,698 --> 00:14:26,440
Of course.

219
00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:28,592
Well. I'll call a taxi.

220
00:14:28,592 --> 00:14:30,419
- We can go home now.
- No.

221
00:14:30,419 --> 00:14:32,900
I remember you said before, there's a direct bus.

222
00:14:32,900 --> 00:14:35,760
It's okay to take a bus.

223
00:14:37,019 --> 00:14:40,358
Fine. And I think we can have a seat on the bus now.

224
00:14:40,358 --> 00:14:43,099
- Let's go home.
- Let's go.

225
00:14:43,140 --> 00:14:44,999
I see that you've lost weight again.

226
00:14:44,999 --> 00:14:47,159
No. I eat a lot every day.

227
00:14:47,159 --> 00:14:49,199
Tonight, I'll cook some delicious dishes for you.

228
00:14:49,199 --> 00:14:50,740
Great.

229
00:14:53,459 --> 00:14:56,800
Lanlan, the environment of your hospital is really nice.

230
00:14:56,800 --> 00:15:00,252
Not many patients. Everyone is so friendly.

231
00:15:00,252 --> 00:15:01,679
Not like others.

232
00:15:01,679 --> 00:15:03,152
So many patients.

233
00:15:03,152 --> 00:15:05,439
Doctors are so busy, just like they are in a war.

234
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:06,840
They are so hard-working.

235
00:15:07,719 --> 00:15:12,119
We are a high-end private hospital, with high fees and good service.

236
00:15:17,860 --> 00:15:22,318
You transferred to an assistant. Why didn't you tell me?

237
00:15:24,300 --> 00:15:26,740
I didn't want you to be worried.

238
00:15:26,740 --> 00:15:28,578
And it's temporary.

239
00:15:28,578 --> 00:15:31,620
Later, I'll go back to Pediatrics.

240
00:15:32,340 --> 00:15:36,650
I met Chief Huang at the reception area.

241
00:15:36,650 --> 00:15:38,399
What did he tell you?

242
00:15:38,399 --> 00:15:41,410
He said you would go back to Pediatrics soon.

243
00:15:41,410 --> 00:15:46,059
And I sent him pecans, hoping that he could support you.

244
00:15:50,619 --> 00:15:56,159
Lanlan, you're just like your dad; very straightforward.

245
00:15:56,159 --> 00:16:00,360
Now you're working, you should learn more social skills.

246
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:02,818
Don't just follow your ideas.

247
00:16:02,818 --> 00:16:05,079
It's not easy to work here.

248
00:16:05,079 --> 00:16:07,990
Learn how to get on well with your leader.

249
00:16:07,990 --> 00:16:09,530
Follow the order.

250
00:16:09,530 --> 00:16:12,430
Or you won't get any benefits in the end.

251
00:16:12,439 --> 00:16:16,119
Mom, you've said it a lot of times.

252
00:16:16,119 --> 00:16:17,899
- Okay.
- You talked my ear off.

253
00:16:17,899 --> 00:16:19,819
Okay, fine.

254
00:16:21,340 --> 00:16:25,919
Well. Have you told your boyfriend that I was here?

255
00:16:29,019 --> 00:16:32,679
He went on a business trip for several days.

256
00:16:33,179 --> 00:16:35,660
Such a coincidence?

257
00:16:36,220 --> 00:16:38,060
Yeah.

258
00:16:38,060 --> 00:16:40,900
You always said, "My boyfriend, my boyfriend..."

259
00:16:40,900 --> 00:16:42,900
What's his family name?

260
00:16:43,399 --> 00:16:44,999
It's...

261
00:16:44,999 --> 00:16:46,640
Lu.

262
00:16:47,320 --> 00:16:49,420
L-V?

263
00:16:49,420 --> 00:16:50,839
No.

264
00:16:50,839 --> 00:16:52,799
It's L-U.

265
00:16:53,760 --> 00:16:55,840
Lu.

266
00:17:08,339 --> 00:17:10,619
It really needs someone to take the lead.

267
00:17:10,619 --> 00:17:13,120
The suggestion box has been set for a while.

268
00:17:13,120 --> 00:17:15,179
Finally, someone told the truth.

269
00:17:15,179 --> 00:17:17,510
Will you tell this news to Assistant Ye?

270
00:17:17,510 --> 00:17:21,439
To encourage her to speak up and fight against injustice.

271
00:17:21,439 --> 00:17:23,420
She's just getting over that,

272
00:17:23,420 --> 00:17:26,190
let her be a happy assistant for several days.

273
00:17:27,180 --> 00:17:29,099
Do you regret getting her involved?

274
00:17:29,099 --> 00:17:30,420
Why should I regret it?

275
00:17:30,420 --> 00:17:32,460
Then, do you care about her?

276
00:17:34,639 --> 00:17:37,419
Yeah. I care about her.

277
00:17:37,419 --> 00:17:40,379
Why so honest suddenly?

278
00:17:40,379 --> 00:17:43,800
Not only do I care about her, I like her.

279
00:17:46,379 --> 00:17:49,660
I found that you are really keen on making me and Ye Shilan a pair.

280
00:17:49,660 --> 00:17:51,360
So why not go with your joke?

281
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:54,498
Or you will say something weird.

282
00:17:54,498 --> 00:17:56,519
I'll take it as if you're telling the truth.

283
00:17:56,519 --> 00:18:00,119
Fine. Wait for our wedding candy.

284
00:18:09,619 --> 00:18:12,260
After several days, Wei's sister will come back.

285
00:18:12,300 --> 00:18:15,200
They can take care of their mom in turns. My mom can go back.

286
00:18:15,279 --> 00:18:18,758
Yao, I'm staying here, is it okay for you?

287
00:18:18,758 --> 00:18:20,979
Of course okay. I'm looking forward to it.

288
00:18:20,979 --> 00:18:23,859
Tonight's dinner is really good.

289
00:18:23,859 --> 00:18:25,959
Enjoy yourself.

290
00:18:26,540 --> 00:18:31,018
Lanlan told me, you're a writer. So great.

291
00:18:31,018 --> 00:18:35,318
Aunt, I'm not a real writer. I just post my novel on the internet.

292
00:18:35,318 --> 00:18:38,040
What kind of novels do you write?

293
00:18:38,780 --> 00:18:40,199
Fairy tales.

294
00:18:40,199 --> 00:18:41,738
Fairy tales are good.

295
00:18:41,738 --> 00:18:46,459
Just like Lanlan, all for children.

296
00:18:46,459 --> 00:18:50,998
Not really, Auntie. I... What I write are

297
00:18:50,998 --> 00:18:53,299
romantic tales.

298
00:18:53,979 --> 00:18:56,440
Romantic tales?

299
00:18:56,440 --> 00:18:58,600
Do you have a boyfriend?

300
00:18:58,600 --> 00:19:00,599
Not yet.

301
00:19:01,660 --> 00:19:04,440
I'm not like Lanlan, so popular.

302
00:19:04,440 --> 00:19:06,520
She is picky.

303
00:19:07,279 --> 00:19:10,339
Have you seen Lanlan's boyfriend?

304
00:19:11,560 --> 00:19:14,420
Auntie, which boyfriend do you mean?

305
00:19:14,420 --> 00:19:18,099
Don't play a joke. My mom will take it seriously.

306
00:19:18,839 --> 00:19:22,378
I mean Lu. Have you seen him?

307
00:19:22,378 --> 00:19:23,898
Oh, Lu.

308
00:19:23,898 --> 00:19:26,778
Yeah. Auntie, Lu is so handsome.

309
00:19:26,778 --> 00:19:28,479
Are you going to meet him this time?

310
00:19:28,479 --> 00:19:32,639
I'd like to meet him, but Lanlan said he was on a business trip.

311
00:19:32,639 --> 00:19:34,599
Business trip? What a pity.

312
00:19:34,599 --> 00:19:37,520
Why don't you ask him to come back?

313
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:40,438
It's a business trip. How can he come back early?

314
00:19:41,279 --> 00:19:44,860
Eat more, speak less.

315
00:19:55,700 --> 00:19:57,400
Whose message?

316
00:19:57,400 --> 00:19:58,900
No one. A spam message.

317
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:05,080
- Come on. Your favorite.
- Thanks.

318
00:20:05,080 --> 00:20:06,978
Enjoy yourself. Come on.

319
00:20:06,978 --> 00:20:09,460
- Yao, have a try.
- Thanks.

320
00:20:24,879 --> 00:20:26,939
Mom, don't do that.

321
00:20:26,939 --> 00:20:28,932
You just took a shower, and you'll get sweaty.

322
00:20:28,932 --> 00:20:31,579
It's okay. Almost done.

323
00:20:32,360 --> 00:20:34,580
Lanlan, have a seat.

324
00:20:41,499 --> 00:20:44,640
How is it going recently?

325
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:48,119
In daily life, do you lack money?

326
00:20:48,119 --> 00:20:50,179
No.

327
00:20:50,739 --> 00:20:53,079
Then, why did you buy so many cup noodles?

328
00:20:53,079 --> 00:20:55,300
Mom, don't misunderstand.

329
00:20:55,300 --> 00:20:57,800
It was a gift from someone else. I don't even think about eating them.

330
00:21:00,379 --> 00:21:03,059
Mom, how about you?

331
00:21:03,059 --> 00:21:05,219
Everything is going well with Uncle Xie?

332
00:21:05,219 --> 00:21:07,019
We're fine.

333
00:21:07,019 --> 00:21:10,520
Your brother is also good, studying very hard.

334
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:15,060
It's just that young people like to buy food online.

335
00:21:15,060 --> 00:21:18,650
And what is it? That community group purchase is very popular.

336
00:21:18,650 --> 00:21:20,599
The business of our vegetable shop is not good.

337
00:21:20,599 --> 00:21:23,850
Your Uncle Xie can handle that alone.

338
00:21:23,850 --> 00:21:25,258
It's time for you to take a break.

339
00:21:25,258 --> 00:21:27,339
Enjoy your daily life.

340
00:21:27,339 --> 00:21:29,619
If you need money, just tell me.

341
00:21:29,619 --> 00:21:32,020
I know you have pressure.

342
00:21:32,020 --> 00:21:36,000
I'm healthy and want to do some work. I'll go back to find other jobs.

343
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:39,958
In this way, when you meet the conditions of the hospital loan and want to buy a house,

344
00:21:39,958 --> 00:21:42,879
I can help you raise more and let you borrow less.

345
00:21:42,879 --> 00:21:45,240
Mom, don't worry about me.

346
00:21:45,240 --> 00:21:47,779
I can make money if I work hard.

347
00:21:47,779 --> 00:21:49,919
Sure. I believe in you.

348
00:21:49,919 --> 00:21:52,419
You're always so excellent.

349
00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:15,500
<i>[Jiang Huaiming]</i>

350
00:22:16,760 --> 00:22:19,559
<i>Chief Huang shared the pecans your mom bought with us.</i>

351
00:22:19,559 --> 00:22:21,260
<i>He's easygoing for this moment.</i>

352
00:22:21,260 --> 00:22:24,160
<i>Tomorrow night, we will have dinner at the old place.</i>

353
00:22:24,160 --> 00:22:26,499
<i>Will you join us and apologize to him?</i>

354
00:22:26,499 --> 00:22:29,320
<i>Maybe he will let go of what happened in the past.</i>

355
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:26,439
What is it?

356
00:23:28,900 --> 00:23:30,880
It's an iris.

357
00:23:33,619 --> 00:23:37,199
It's kind of... the flower of friendship.

358
00:23:38,900 --> 00:23:40,959
Flower of friendship?

359
00:23:42,700 --> 00:23:45,158
It's pretty. Good for this moment.

360
00:23:45,158 --> 00:23:47,019
Good job.

361
00:23:47,019 --> 00:23:48,740
Thank you.

362
00:23:49,379 --> 00:23:50,959
You don't feel well today?

363
00:23:50,959 --> 00:23:52,599
I am good.

364
00:23:52,599 --> 00:23:54,739
Maybe I didn't sleep well last night.

365
00:23:54,739 --> 00:23:56,258
Do you want to take a day off?

366
00:23:56,258 --> 00:23:57,699
No, I don't need it. I'm fine.

367
00:23:57,699 --> 00:23:58,739
I mean it.

368
00:23:58,739 --> 00:24:00,680
I am really good.

369
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:05,418
By the way, this afternoon, I'll go to your home to get the clothes for dry cleaning.

370
00:24:05,418 --> 00:24:08,319
Just call me if you need me.

371
00:24:08,319 --> 00:24:10,480
Sure. You can take a taxi.

372
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:13,478
It's fine. I can go by bus.

373
00:24:22,700 --> 00:24:25,759
If there's an emergency, I will call a taxi.

374
00:24:25,759 --> 00:24:28,939
Great. You don't have to save money for me,

375
00:24:28,939 --> 00:24:30,699
but you should work comfortably.

376
00:24:30,699 --> 00:24:34,100
After all, you sent me flowers of friendship.

377
00:24:35,660 --> 00:24:37,980
Well, I understand.

378
00:24:37,980 --> 00:24:41,499
Do I need to do anything for Miss Ji?

379
00:24:41,499 --> 00:24:44,839
No, leave her alone. Do what you're supposed to do.

380
00:24:44,839 --> 00:24:47,800
Got it. Have a nice day.

381
00:24:58,360 --> 00:25:02,860
Ye Shilan. How about having lunch?

382
00:25:02,860 --> 00:25:04,680
I have an appointment at noon.

383
00:25:04,680 --> 00:25:06,820
With whom?

384
00:25:06,820 --> 00:25:10,180
Did you lie to me because you don't want to eat with me?

385
00:25:10,180 --> 00:25:12,040
No.

386
00:25:12,580 --> 00:25:16,840
You can tell me the truth. I can go through it.

387
00:25:16,840 --> 00:25:19,559
It's true. With my best girlfriend.

388
00:25:19,559 --> 00:25:22,500
She's working at Time Garden Cafe.

389
00:25:22,500 --> 00:25:25,379
I see. Enjoy your lunch. I'll go to the dining hall.

390
00:25:25,379 --> 00:25:27,000
Thank you.

391
00:25:36,619 --> 00:25:39,580
That's why you've been worried these days.

392
00:25:39,580 --> 00:25:42,000
You should have told me earlier.

393
00:25:42,579 --> 00:25:44,919
After all, I didn't think it through.

394
00:25:45,580 --> 00:25:48,199
So as you said,

395
00:25:48,199 --> 00:25:52,259
Lu Zhaoxi doesn't care if his position is influenced or not.

396
00:25:52,259 --> 00:25:56,038
The president is just a job that will help him leave for his next job.

397
00:25:56,038 --> 00:25:58,340
That's why I am worried.

398
00:25:58,340 --> 00:26:02,120
If I go back to Pediatrics, life will be horrible.

399
00:26:02,120 --> 00:26:05,739
Even if he doesn't leave now, I can't go to him for everything.

400
00:26:05,739 --> 00:26:08,680
This will only annoy Chief Huang even more.

401
00:26:09,339 --> 00:26:12,700
Lu Zhaoxi is supposed to be domineering.

402
00:26:13,580 --> 00:26:15,220
What do you mean?

403
00:26:15,220 --> 00:26:19,519
In a novel, it is not a casual thing for a domineering boss to deal with his subordinate.

404
00:26:22,339 --> 00:26:24,638
"You only have five minutes to clean this office.

405
00:26:24,638 --> 00:26:29,080
I don't want to see him ever again."

406
00:26:29,080 --> 00:26:33,080
Then he looks into the eyes of the heroine.

407
00:26:33,080 --> 00:26:35,400
He corners her against the wall.

408
00:26:36,780 --> 00:26:40,020
"From now on, no one can hurt you.

409
00:26:40,020 --> 00:26:43,239
I will protect you forever."

410
00:26:46,359 --> 00:26:47,980
The nerve.

411
00:26:47,980 --> 00:26:49,138
What a pity.

412
00:26:49,138 --> 00:26:51,539
The novel is very plump, the reality is very skinny.

413
00:26:51,539 --> 00:26:54,700
There are too many things for everyone to consider in their positions.

414
00:26:54,700 --> 00:26:56,940
It's impossible to be totally reckless.

415
00:26:56,940 --> 00:26:59,680
Even the president is no exception.

416
00:27:01,979 --> 00:27:06,160
You say... If I went to Chief Huang and bowed my head,

417
00:27:06,160 --> 00:27:08,440
would they look down on me?

418
00:27:08,440 --> 00:27:11,780
You mean Lu Zhaoxi, or your colleagues?

419
00:27:12,360 --> 00:27:14,280
Maybe all of them?

420
00:27:16,580 --> 00:27:19,479
Your colleagues are also suffering because of him.

421
00:27:19,479 --> 00:27:22,739
Isn't it true that your co-workers are also suffering from anger all the time? They won't look down upon you.

422
00:27:22,739 --> 00:27:27,398
And Lu Zhaoxi, he once tried to get the information from you at Taoyuan Village.

423
00:27:27,398 --> 00:27:30,659
But he had to do what he disliked.

424
00:27:30,659 --> 00:27:32,819
Even the president lives against himself,

425
00:27:32,819 --> 00:27:35,038
it's harder for common people like us

426
00:27:35,038 --> 00:27:38,800
to live happily if we only think about saving face.

427
00:27:49,180 --> 00:27:51,680
<i>Look forward to your coming again.</i>

428
00:27:59,900 --> 00:28:03,880
Today, I posted an announcement on WeChat

429
00:28:03,880 --> 00:28:05,759
about my new book's publication.

430
00:28:05,759 --> 00:28:07,880
Did you read it?

431
00:28:10,639 --> 00:28:13,539
But I noticed no one reposted it.

432
00:28:13,539 --> 00:28:16,799
Even my patients reposted it.

433
00:28:16,799 --> 00:28:20,079
Where were my doctors? Only Jiang Huaiming did it.

434
00:28:20,079 --> 00:28:21,899
What about you?

435
00:28:21,899 --> 00:28:23,679
Now you are playing dumb with me.

436
00:28:23,680 --> 00:28:26,760
Don't you know we are a group?

437
00:28:26,760 --> 00:28:30,059
I haven't checked my WeChat yet. I'll repost it immediately.

438
00:28:30,760 --> 00:28:33,160
<i>[Your children can be healthier]</i>

439
00:28:33,160 --> 00:28:37,299
You are truly blessed without knowing it.

440
00:28:37,299 --> 00:28:39,230
Think about it.

441
00:28:39,230 --> 00:28:41,306
For these years of writing books,

442
00:28:41,306 --> 00:28:44,300
how many patients come to us

443
00:28:44,300 --> 00:28:48,139
because of my reputation?

444
00:28:48,139 --> 00:28:51,679
One more thing. Did I introduce patients to you?

445
00:28:51,679 --> 00:28:54,459
So you can be a contracted family doctor.

446
00:28:54,459 --> 00:28:57,499
Do other departments have such benefits?

447
00:28:57,499 --> 00:28:59,680
Do they?

448
00:29:00,820 --> 00:29:03,360
And speaking of our president...

449
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:05,679
<i>We're done. Chief got drunk again.</i>

450
00:29:05,679 --> 00:29:08,078
He won't allow you to make documents for me.

451
00:29:08,079 --> 00:29:09,839
It seems he's helping you,

452
00:29:09,839 --> 00:29:16,360
but it's bad for you, and even worse for the hospital.

453
00:29:16,360 --> 00:29:17,918
But he doesn't care about that.

454
00:29:17,918 --> 00:29:19,859
He's the son of nobility.

455
00:29:19,859 --> 00:29:21,980
And you?

456
00:29:21,980 --> 00:29:24,618
You are nothing at all.

457
00:29:24,618 --> 00:29:28,020
<i>This is the legendary "an idiot wants to show off."</i>

458
00:29:35,420 --> 00:29:39,239
Li Yuanzhe. I see you swiping your phone every day.

459
00:29:39,239 --> 00:29:40,940
Even you're getting stupid.

460
00:29:40,940 --> 00:29:43,860
Why are you laughing at your phone?

461
00:29:45,180 --> 00:29:49,959
I ask. What do you learn from swiping your phone every day?

462
00:29:51,039 --> 00:29:56,159
Oh, yes. I heard you're going on a blind date to get married.

463
00:29:56,159 --> 00:29:59,180
How would a woman fall in love with you?

464
00:29:59,180 --> 00:30:00,939
As I see, you don't have to live with a wife,

465
00:30:00,939 --> 00:30:02,618
because it's good to live with your phone.

466
00:30:02,618 --> 00:30:05,459
Maybe someday, your phone will laugh back at you.

467
00:30:05,459 --> 00:30:07,280
Isn't that so?

468
00:30:10,020 --> 00:30:12,039
- You are...
- Chief.

469
00:30:14,359 --> 00:30:16,238
Your new book being printed today.

470
00:30:16,238 --> 00:30:18,060
I want to propose a toast to our chief.

471
00:30:18,060 --> 00:30:19,380
Congratulations to Chief.

472
00:30:19,380 --> 00:30:20,738
Yeah. Come on.

473
00:30:20,738 --> 00:30:22,739
- Fine.
- Chief, drink it all.

474
00:30:22,739 --> 00:30:24,099
- Congratulations, Chief.
- Cheers.

475
00:30:24,099 --> 00:30:25,980
Congratulations to you.

476
00:30:25,980 --> 00:30:29,520
I hope our Pediatrics Department will have a better future.

477
00:30:38,079 --> 00:30:40,999
Well... Zeng.

478
00:30:40,999 --> 00:30:42,720
You didn't drink?

479
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:45,880
It's inconvenient today.

480
00:30:46,560 --> 00:30:49,059
It's inconvenient that you can't drink.

481
00:30:49,059 --> 00:30:51,319
Of course, you can't drink.

482
00:30:51,319 --> 00:30:55,039
But... I have to say something about you lesbians.

483
00:30:55,039 --> 00:31:00,018
Usually, we always call for equality between men and women. Equality.

484
00:31:00,100 --> 00:31:03,800
But once you encounter something, little things need to be specialized.

485
00:31:03,839 --> 00:31:05,978
We don't know what your specialization is.

486
00:31:05,978 --> 00:31:09,719
Or if it's really special. Is it true or not?

487
00:31:11,139 --> 00:31:15,020
And you said you were a lesbian.

488
00:31:15,020 --> 00:31:16,419
Why do you apply for a loan to buy a house?

489
00:31:16,419 --> 00:31:19,739
Just marry a man with a house. Isn't it enough for you?

490
00:31:19,739 --> 00:31:24,199
You're under pressure, but as the Chief of Pediatrics, Chief Huang, I have to waste...

491
00:31:24,199 --> 00:31:27,279
Chief Huang, thanks for your care.

492
00:31:27,279 --> 00:31:29,679
My toast to you.

493
00:31:29,679 --> 00:31:30,900
Chief Huang.

494
00:31:30,900 --> 00:31:34,299
Actually, I'll drink it for Dr. Zeng.

495
00:31:39,680 --> 00:31:40,858
Great.

496
00:31:40,858 --> 00:31:43,680
As men, you all should learn from Zijian.

497
00:31:43,680 --> 00:31:46,019
Look what he did. Nice.

498
00:31:46,739 --> 00:31:48,780
The hero saved the beauty. Didn't he?

499
00:31:48,780 --> 00:31:51,020
No, I'm not a hero.

500
00:31:51,020 --> 00:31:52,859
I feel something.

501
00:31:52,859 --> 00:31:55,719
Look at you, sitting together closely.

502
00:31:56,379 --> 00:31:57,899
Like a real couple.

503
00:31:57,899 --> 00:32:00,098
Chief Huang, I have a girlfriend.

504
00:32:00,098 --> 00:32:01,659
So what?

505
00:32:01,659 --> 00:32:03,498
It's just a girlfriend. You haven't gotten married.

506
00:32:03,498 --> 00:32:06,419
It's possible to get a divorce, even if you get married. Right?

507
00:32:06,419 --> 00:32:09,039
So as far as I see, you're perfect for each other.

508
00:32:09,040 --> 00:32:10,660
<i>There's a chance.</i>

509
00:32:10,660 --> 00:32:12,280
<i>Awesome.</i>

510
00:32:13,400 --> 00:32:15,300
<i>- Did you buy a house, Zijian?
- No</i>

511
00:32:17,139 --> 00:32:20,818
<i>It's good to hear it. You can help her to pay the loan together.</i>

512
00:32:26,339 --> 00:32:30,500
Huang Bohao, he's even worse than what Ye Shilan said about him.

513
00:32:30,500 --> 00:32:32,980
He truly annoying.

514
00:32:32,980 --> 00:32:35,190
That's why I told you not to watch it on iPad.

515
00:32:35,190 --> 00:32:36,910
You would be disgusted.

516
00:32:36,918 --> 00:32:40,058
It's not far from us. Do you want to watch it from the scene?

517
00:32:41,359 --> 00:32:45,660
If it is the daily routine of Pediatrics, just let him continue the show.

518
00:32:45,660 --> 00:32:47,860
It will be the last time.

519
00:32:49,420 --> 00:32:53,579
I was thinking about today if I should invite Ye Shilan to watch this.

520
00:32:53,579 --> 00:32:55,400
Luckily, she didn't see it.

521
00:32:55,400 --> 00:32:58,780
If she watched it, she would have broken my phone.

522
00:32:59,239 --> 00:33:01,080
You can rest assured.

523
00:33:01,080 --> 00:33:03,539
Ordinary people vent their anger even if they want to smash things,

524
00:33:03,539 --> 00:33:07,219
if they are rational, expensive things won't get smashed.

525
00:33:38,780 --> 00:33:41,460
Calm down. You know, endurance.

526
00:33:41,460 --> 00:33:43,060
Hold it.

527
00:33:45,900 --> 00:33:47,599
All I hope is that,

528
00:33:47,599 --> 00:33:51,999
with my guidance Pediatrics will be the best department

529
00:33:51,999 --> 00:33:54,940
in Anxing Hospital. Come on. Fill up your drinks.

530
00:33:54,940 --> 00:33:56,980
Hold it in your hand. Let's celebrate in advance.

531
00:33:56,980 --> 00:34:00,000
Everyone must drink it. You must drink it.

532
00:34:06,300 --> 00:34:08,299
Chief Huang.

533
00:34:13,379 --> 00:34:14,759
<i>Look.</i>

534
00:34:14,759 --> 00:34:17,980
<i>Isn't it... the Great Assistant Ye?</i>

535
00:34:17,980 --> 00:34:21,740
<i>- Why are you here?</i>
- What's she doing there?

536
00:34:21,740 --> 00:34:26,080
<i>Did you come here to pass on the president's opinion?</i>

537
00:34:27,020 --> 00:34:28,319
No.

538
00:34:28,319 --> 00:34:32,600
I came here as a doctor of Pediatrics.

539
00:34:34,360 --> 00:34:35,700
I forgot about it.

540
00:34:35,700 --> 00:34:38,979
Though she's an assistant now, she is still our member

541
00:34:38,979 --> 00:34:41,299
Well, come here, take a seat. Come in. Here.

542
00:34:41,299 --> 00:34:46,719
Huaiming, offer the seat to Dr. Ye, and a set of tableware.

543
00:34:48,920 --> 00:34:51,340
Come in. Here is your seat.

544
00:34:51,340 --> 00:34:55,159
Dr. Ye, in recent days,

545
00:34:55,159 --> 00:34:59,898
you didn't participate in any Pediatric dinner parties.

546
00:34:59,898 --> 00:35:04,499
But to be honest, you're still our member.

547
00:35:04,499 --> 00:35:07,138
So, everybody, make yourself at home.

548
00:35:07,138 --> 00:35:08,839
Relax, eat and drink whatever you want.

549
00:35:08,840 --> 00:35:13,540
<i>Later, you can have a talk with Dr. Ye.</i>

550
00:35:14,239 --> 00:35:18,180
Does she know what she is doing now?

551
00:35:18,180 --> 00:35:20,620
Assistant Ye, I think she is calling for a truce.

552
00:35:20,620 --> 00:35:22,778
Huang Bohao already has a problem with her.

553
00:35:22,778 --> 00:35:27,160
Now he's drunk, I don't know how he'll humiliate her.

554
00:35:29,180 --> 00:35:30,719
President Lu.

555
00:35:32,579 --> 00:35:34,799
President Lu!

556
00:35:34,799 --> 00:35:39,060
Dr. Ye, your appearance reminds me of something.

557
00:35:39,060 --> 00:35:44,999
Yesterday, your mother brought pecans to us.

558
00:35:44,999 --> 00:35:48,338
I've shared them with our colleagues.

559
00:35:48,338 --> 00:35:49,680
<i>They were delicious.</i>

560
00:35:49,680 --> 00:35:51,020
<i>Truly delicious.</i>

561
00:35:51,020 --> 00:35:54,120
<i>Thanks so much to your mother.</i>

562
00:35:55,900 --> 00:35:57,940
I'm glad you like them.

563
00:35:57,940 --> 00:36:00,580
All of you have taken and tried them.

564
00:36:00,580 --> 00:36:05,040
As I heard, the pecan can...

565
00:36:05,040 --> 00:36:08,540
<i>keep your brain healthy. Right?</i>

566
00:36:09,779 --> 00:36:13,519
Dr. Ye, did you leave some nuts to yourself?

567
00:36:13,519 --> 00:36:19,040
I feel that you are the one who needs them most.

568
00:36:21,479 --> 00:36:23,059
You know me.

569
00:36:23,059 --> 00:36:25,279
I am too gentle and nice,

570
00:36:25,279 --> 00:36:32,319
to see parents stand out for their children.

571
00:36:32,319 --> 00:36:36,180
Dr. Ye, your plan...

572
00:36:36,180 --> 00:36:37,959
worked.

573
00:36:38,740 --> 00:36:43,679
<i>But I... I have to... say something else to you.</i>

574
00:36:43,679 --> 00:36:45,199
<i>Look at yourself.</i>

575
00:36:45,199 --> 00:36:46,939
You are an adult now.

576
00:36:46,939 --> 00:36:49,360
So you should think more of your parents

577
00:36:49,360 --> 00:36:54,600
before making a decision.

578
00:36:56,000 --> 00:37:00,379
<i>You need to know who truly cares about you,</i>

579
00:37:00,379 --> 00:37:04,339
and the purpose of everything you do.

580
00:37:05,819 --> 00:37:07,260
Yes.

581
00:37:07,300 --> 00:37:13,100
I am most disgusted by people who go to report to the leader without moving their finger.

582
00:37:13,180 --> 00:37:15,820
If this kind of thing happens over and over again,

583
00:37:15,820 --> 00:37:20,499
who would dare to talk to you in the future?

584
00:37:21,579 --> 00:37:24,539
<i>Think before you take any action.</i>

585
00:37:25,313 --> 00:37:27,593
<i>Why did you do all of these things?</i>

586
00:37:27,593 --> 00:37:30,620
For... For promotion and salary?

587
00:37:30,620 --> 00:37:32,480
Or do you think...

588
00:37:32,480 --> 00:37:36,660
you're working in a high position

589
00:37:36,660 --> 00:37:39,919
as an assistant of the president?

590
00:37:40,859 --> 00:37:42,459
Here's another explanation.

591
00:37:42,459 --> 00:37:44,839
That guy... Lu Zhaoxi.

592
00:37:44,839 --> 00:37:46,379
<i>President Lu.</i>

593
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:50,600
If someone reincarnates well, he becomes the president.

594
00:37:50,620 --> 00:37:53,840
<i>If you hang around with him,</i>

595
00:37:53,840 --> 00:37:56,079
<i>do you think...</i>

596
00:37:56,079 --> 00:38:00,500
you can be his wife?

597
00:38:01,900 --> 00:38:03,600
Chief Huang.

598
00:38:14,819 --> 00:38:16,539
I was wrong.

599
00:38:22,239 --> 00:38:23,920
<i>You know, a person...</i>

600
00:38:23,920 --> 00:38:26,640
<i>always makes mistakes,</i>

601
00:38:26,640 --> 00:38:30,980
but admitting mistakes is progress.

602
00:38:30,980 --> 00:38:33,919
Dr. Ye, what do you think?

603
00:38:33,919 --> 00:38:37,680
At least I am the chief of our department.

604
00:38:37,680 --> 00:38:41,560
And... our colleagues are here with us.

605
00:38:41,560 --> 00:38:45,219
Don't you think... you should say something?

606
00:38:45,219 --> 00:38:49,779
An apology. With the right attitude and tone.

607

608

Chief Huang, as punishment...

609
00:39:04,299 --> 00:39:06,239
I'll drink three cups.

610
00:39:07,059 --> 00:39:10,239
Look, guys. Look at Dr. Ye.

611
00:39:10,239 --> 00:39:15,599
As you all know, Dr. Ye is the one who usually pissed me off in our department.

612
00:39:15,599 --> 00:39:20,259
But she is a straightforward person, which I admire a lot.

Okay. Thank you.

618
00:39:37,460 --> 00:39:41,980
I didn't expect that Dr. Ye could drink a lot.

619
00:39:53,819 --> 00:39:55,560
Enough.

620
00:40:01,900 --> 00:40:05,800
President Lu, what do you mean by this?

621
00:40:06,339 --> 00:40:08,900
It should be asking you "what do you mean by this"?

622
00:40:08,900 --> 00:40:11,918
I... What can I mean?

623
00:40:11,918 --> 00:40:14,579
Our Pediatrics, of Anxing Hospital,

624
00:40:14,579 --> 00:40:17,479
is having a dinner party here.

625
00:40:17,479 --> 00:40:19,138
Now, is not working time,

626
00:40:19,138 --> 00:40:22,720
so is it against the regulations of our hospital?

627
00:40:22,720 --> 00:40:24,720
You took advantage of your power,

628
00:40:24,720 --> 00:40:27,798
to occupy your subordinates off time to drink with you.

629
00:40:27,798 --> 00:40:30,299
I heard you were drunk, bragging and bullshitting here.

630
00:40:30,299 --> 00:40:33,559
Wantonly trampling on the dignity of others. Is that humorous to you?

631
00:40:33,559 --> 00:40:36,259
Is this what you call team building?

632
00:40:40,980 --> 00:40:45,059
Ye Shilan, now I see why you came here today.

633
00:40:45,059 --> 00:40:49,379
- So you and the president schemed to set me up here. Did you?
- No, I didn't.

634
00:40:49,379 --> 00:40:51,500
Don't be afraid. We did.

635
00:40:51,500 --> 00:40:55,639
You're right. I sent Ye Shilan to join this dinner today.

636
00:40:55,639 --> 00:40:56,999
What do you want from her?

637
00:40:56,999 --> 00:40:59,600
