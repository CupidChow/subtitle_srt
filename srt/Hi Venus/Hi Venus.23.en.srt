She wanted to give you a surprise, but I can't keep it a secret.

Not just a few days.

We have to finish the follow-up work of the last free clinic first,

they tried to hide this from us.

Actually, I already knew there was something wrong between them.

74

But you wanted Dr. Ye to be my girlfriend.

90
00:07:07,458 --> 00:07:10,679
Send her a WeChat message and invite her with us.

Me?

92
00:07:12,659 --> 00:07:16,819
Don't bother. Dr. Ye went to Taoyuan Village.

No. Someone told me about it.

She'll stay there for three months.

97
00:07:24,578 --> 00:07:28,720
Is she upset because of the things that happened recently?

98
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:30,060
Maybe.

99
00:07:30,060 --> 00:07:34,319
Or she wouldn't leave all of a sudden, even without saying goodbye.

100
00:07:34,319 --> 00:07:37,458
But this thing is quite annoying.

00:12:19,598 --> 00:12:24,699
Please explain it to him clearly tomorrow.

163
00:12:24,699 --> 00:12:26,640
Please.

164
00:12:39,459 --> 00:12:42,520
- Go to the hospital.
- No.

165
00:12:43,340 --> 00:12:46,780
Chairman Lu asked me to send you home. He'll find you later.

166
00:12:46,780 --> 00:12:49,619
My dad will find me? Why didn't he tell me about it?

167
00:12:49,619 --> 00:12:52,139
President, get in the car.

168
00:13:32,420 --> 00:13:36,420
Assistant Lin must be explaining it to him now.

169
00:13:38,059 --> 00:13:41,599
Don't be angry.

170
00:13:54,980 --> 00:13:57,539
Chairman Lu cares about you as the president,

171
00:13:57,539 --> 00:14:00,640
so he asked me to report to him at the beginning.

172
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:03,739
About the details, Chairman Lu wants to tell you himself.

173
00:14:03,739 --> 00:14:06,019
You can ask him directly.

174
00:14:06,839 --> 00:14:08,780
I betrayed your trust.

175
00:14:08,780 --> 00:14:12,819
You can be mad at me or just fire me.

176
00:14:15,499 --> 00:14:17,700
Are you listening to me?

177
00:14:17,700 --> 00:14:20,320
Yes. Continue.

178
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:22,618
Chairman Lu asked you to go on a business trip on purpose.

179
00:14:22,618 --> 00:14:25,159
Then he talked with Dr. Ye.

180
00:14:25,159 --> 00:14:27,179
Dr. Ye listened to Chairman Lu's advice,

181
00:14:27,179 --> 00:14:29,416
and convinced President Gao that you have broken up.

182
00:14:29,416 --> 00:14:31,410
To not continue to expand public opinion

183
00:14:31,410 --> 00:14:34,420
and to avoid involving Dr. Ye's family.

184
00:14:35,080 --> 00:14:36,739
How did he make him believe it?

185
00:14:36,739 --> 00:14:39,459
Dr. Ye volunteered to go to Taoyuan Village.

186
00:14:39,459 --> 00:14:41,740
And she went there the next day.

187
00:14:41,740 --> 00:14:44,400
She told everyone that you had broken up.

188
00:14:48,279 --> 00:14:52,719
So the situation is, Ye Shilan is in Taoyuan Village,

189
00:14:52,719 --> 00:14:55,219
and everyone in the hospital thinks we have broken up.

190
00:14:55,300 --> 00:14:59,700
And I, as a party involved, was blocked by you and completely kept in the dark.

191
00:14:59,700 --> 00:15:01,759
Yes.

192
00:15:01,759 --> 00:15:03,980
You guys are amazing.

193
00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:13,400
<i>[Ye Shilan]</i>

194
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:40,800
Why hasn't he called me yet?

195
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:43,200
Is there nothing he wants to know?

196
00:15:46,499 --> 00:15:48,160
<i>The president has arrived home.</i>

197
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:51,400
<i>About your part, I've explained as much as I can.</i>

198
00:16:02,040 --> 00:16:03,540
<i>[Lu Zhaoxi]</i>

199
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:13,080
<i>[Ye Shilan]</i>

200
00:16:19,359 --> 00:16:20,660
Hello.

201
00:16:20,660 --> 00:16:22,740
<i>Have you arrived home?</i>

202
00:16:24,080 --> 00:16:25,220
Yeah.

203
00:16:27,180 --> 00:16:31,180
Assistant Lin told you about it, right?

204
00:16:31,180 --> 00:16:33,100
Tell me what?

205
00:16:33,100 --> 00:16:37,939
About the fake news that we broke up.

206
00:16:37,939 --> 00:16:39,739
Is it fake?

207
00:16:39,739 --> 00:16:42,699
It's fake. Of course, it's fake.

208
00:16:43,740 --> 00:16:46,439
I heard everyone in the hospital knows about it.

209
00:16:46,439 --> 00:16:50,280
I'm the only one who foolishly thought I had a girlfriend.

210
00:16:50,280 --> 00:16:54,380
Yes, you have. I'm your girlfriend.

211
00:16:55,499 --> 00:16:57,660
I don't trust you now.

212
00:16:57,660 --> 00:16:59,700
You are so tactful now.

213
00:16:59,700 --> 00:17:02,790
<i>When you're lying, you don't even blink.</i>

214
00:17:02,790 --> 00:17:04,750
I didn't want to like to you,

215
00:17:04,750 --> 00:17:08,410
but your dad said, you wouldn't agree with his plan.

216
00:17:08,410 --> 00:17:10,030
Of course, I wouldn't.

217
00:17:10,030 --> 00:17:12,860
Can our love be treated so casually like this?

218
00:17:14,099 --> 00:17:16,499
But he is your dad.

219
00:17:16,499 --> 00:17:18,719
I can't oppose him.

220
00:17:18,719 --> 00:17:20,919
So you are bullying me.

221
00:17:20,919 --> 00:17:23,100
You think I'm easy to deal with.

222
00:17:23,100 --> 00:17:24,900
<i>That's not it.</i>

223
00:17:25,540 --> 00:17:27,819
I thought you would understand.

224
00:17:27,819 --> 00:17:32,679
I do understand, but it doesn't mean I can't be angry.

225
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:36,400
Sorry.

226
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:38,280
It's my fault.

227
00:17:42,737 --> 00:17:44,223
I won't talk with you now.

228
00:17:44,223 --> 00:17:48,179
My dad is here. Think about it yourself.

229
00:17:48,979 --> 00:17:50,220
Okay.

230
00:17:50,220 --> 00:17:51,939
Bye-bye.

231
00:18:12,460 --> 00:18:14,760
Why are you looking at me like this?

232
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:17,180
I'm helping you solve the problem.

233
00:18:17,180 --> 00:18:19,800
Are you helping me or tricking me?

234
00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:21,680
You didn't trust me from the beginning.

235
00:18:21,680 --> 00:18:23,900
It's not that I didn't trust you.

236
00:18:23,900 --> 00:18:26,640
I just asked Assistant Lin to report to me.

237
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:29,519
I didn't interfere with any of your decisions.

238
00:18:29,519 --> 00:18:31,300
I'm just an observer.

239
00:18:31,300 --> 00:18:33,980
So why are you taking action now?

240
00:18:34,540 --> 00:18:37,739
Because this is my job.

241
00:18:37,739 --> 00:18:40,500
I've already prepared Plan B.

242
00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:42,819
Plan B?

243
00:18:44,580 --> 00:18:49,159
When you donated the B-ultrasonic machines and medicine to Taoyuan Village Clinic,

244
00:18:49,159 --> 00:18:54,460
I asked Assistant Lin to do something about the price and payment.

245
00:18:56,279 --> 00:18:58,300
Why?

246
00:18:58,300 --> 00:19:03,000
If Assistant Lin was unable to gain Gao Xuan's complete trust,

247
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,962
this was his best bargaining chip.

248
00:19:11,259 --> 00:19:14,479
I always thought I was the one playing chess.

249
00:19:14,479 --> 00:19:17,380
I didn't expect to be a pawn at the same time.

250
00:19:21,219 --> 00:19:24,059
So has Assistant Lin used that chip?

251
00:19:24,059 --> 00:19:25,780
Yes.

252
00:19:25,780 --> 00:19:29,499
He not only won Gao Xuan's trust but also diverted his attention

253
00:19:29,499 --> 00:19:31,979
and rescued Ye Shilan.

254
00:19:37,080 --> 00:19:42,019
Forget it. It seems you sold me at a good price.

255
00:19:42,759 --> 00:19:44,899
So what should we do next?

256
00:19:44,899 --> 00:19:49,319
Someone reported you to the group.

257
00:19:49,319 --> 00:19:51,460
I had a meeting before I came here.

258
00:19:51,460 --> 00:19:54,419
You're officially suspended.

259
00:19:54,419 --> 00:19:57,860
Xu Liyang will temporarily take over your job.

260
00:19:58,639 --> 00:20:04,079
Good. I don't want to go to the hospital and hear people talking about my breakup.

261
00:20:04,079 --> 00:20:07,619
Assistant Lin found the planner of this public opinion.

262
00:20:07,619 --> 00:20:09,699
At the expense of not being held accountable,

263
00:20:09,699 --> 00:20:12,079
he got two bank payment accounts.

264
00:20:12,079 --> 00:20:16,499
The auditor has followed the clues and has obtained strong evidence.

265
00:20:16,499 --> 00:20:20,900
Besides, Gao Xuan allowed Assistant Lin to join his group.

266
00:20:20,900 --> 00:20:24,100
We'll know everything we need to know.

267
00:20:24,100 --> 00:20:26,920
I will leave the rest of the work to you.

268
00:20:26,920 --> 00:20:29,119
After things are resolved,

269
00:20:29,119 --> 00:20:32,479
I will restore your reputation at the group meeting.

270
00:20:33,019 --> 00:20:36,660
Okay. I'll deal with it carefully.

271
00:20:36,660 --> 00:20:38,730
Also in this matter,

272
00:20:38,730 --> 00:20:41,070
don't blame Assistant Lin.

273
00:20:41,079 --> 00:20:43,540
He was just following orders.

274
00:20:43,540 --> 00:20:47,200
Instead, you should seriously reflect on yourself.

275
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:52,260
It was you who was not careful and vigilant enough.

276
00:21:04,139 --> 00:21:06,160
Anything else?

277
00:21:11,820 --> 00:21:14,880
You don't have anything else to hide from me, do you?

278
00:21:15,379 --> 00:21:16,699
Like what?

279
00:21:16,699 --> 00:21:21,460
In fact, you don't want me to be with Ye Shilan.

280
00:21:23,080 --> 00:21:25,339
How could it be?

281
00:21:25,339 --> 00:21:28,780
The fake breakup was your mom's idea.

282
00:21:28,780 --> 00:21:30,479
My mom?

283
00:21:31,420 --> 00:21:34,280
Does she think everything has gone too well in my relationship?

284
00:21:34,280 --> 00:21:36,890
She thinks, since you like Ye Shilan so much,

285
00:21:36,890 --> 00:21:39,630
there shouldn't be a problem.

286
00:21:48,540 --> 00:21:52,140
Was I too proactive before?

287
00:22:01,960 --> 00:22:04,359
Hello, President.

288
00:22:04,359 --> 00:22:06,218
<i>I'm not the president anymore.</i>

289
00:22:06,218 --> 00:22:09,798
Don't say that. You're always my president.

290
00:22:10,339 --> 00:22:12,879
Why does that sound so disgusting?

291
00:22:14,099 --> 00:22:16,459
Does Dean Xu want to change the office?

292
00:22:16,459 --> 00:22:19,179
He wants to wait until he is officially appointed.

293
00:22:20,219 --> 00:22:23,679
When you come to my home after work, bring me the Pieris japonica on my table.

294
00:22:23,679 --> 00:22:25,380
Okay.

295
00:22:27,560 --> 00:22:29,519
Pieris japonica?

296
00:22:29,519 --> 00:22:31,279
What is that?

297
00:22:35,700 --> 00:22:37,318
I remembered changing the water for it.

298
00:22:37,319 --> 00:22:39,900
Why have so many leaves fallen?

299
00:22:39,900 --> 00:22:42,220
It can't live long without a root.

300
00:22:42,220 --> 00:22:44,639
If I take good care of it, it can survive for two months.

301
00:22:44,639 --> 00:22:46,438
I can buy a new one for you.

302
00:22:46,439 --> 00:22:47,879
No, thanks.

303
00:22:49,619 --> 00:22:51,179
Have you finished?

304
00:22:52,859 --> 00:22:54,780
When did you make this plan?

305
00:22:54,780 --> 00:22:56,939
I had been thinking about it during the business trip.

306
00:22:56,939 --> 00:22:59,260
I just sorted it out.

307
00:22:59,260 --> 00:23:01,180
I want to wait until Gao Xuan's matter is resolved,

308
00:23:01,180 --> 00:23:02,809
before making a wave of public opinion.

309
00:23:02,809 --> 00:23:04,959
Okay, I'll arrange the execution.

310
00:23:04,959 --> 00:23:06,300
Come here and sit.

311
00:23:06,300 --> 00:23:08,530
Let's discuss what we should do next.

312
00:23:08,531 --> 00:23:10,660
I want it is settled as soon as possible.

313
00:23:24,700 --> 00:23:28,760
<i>[Ye Shilan: Can you forgive me?]
[Lu: I'm busy.]</i>

314
00:23:49,219 --> 00:23:51,360
<i>Are you done?
[Ye Shilan]</i>

315
00:23:54,780 --> 00:23:56,420
<i>Video chat with me.</i>

316
00:24:15,400 --> 00:24:17,239
<i>You finally replied to me.</i>

317
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:20,080
I'm in a bad mood.

318
00:24:21,180 --> 00:24:24,220
I know. Sorry.

319
00:24:24,220 --> 00:24:26,300
<i>You don't even know.</i>

320
00:24:27,499 --> 00:24:29,420
I was happy when I got off the plane.

321
00:24:29,420 --> 00:24:31,939
I thought I was going to meet my girlfriend.

322
00:24:31,939 --> 00:24:34,800
I was splashed with cold water.

323
00:24:34,800 --> 00:24:36,859
My subordinate had been lying to me.

324
00:24:36,859 --> 00:24:39,279
<i>My girlfriend left without saying goodbye.</i>

325
00:24:39,279 --> 00:24:42,159
<i>When I got home, I found I lost my job.</i>

326
00:24:42,159 --> 00:24:45,919
<i>Tell me. Is anyone more miserable than me?</i>

327
00:24:45,919 --> 00:24:47,218
What's wrong with your job?

328
00:24:47,218 --> 00:24:50,619
You don't know? I was suspended.

329
00:24:50,619 --> 00:24:52,420
Why?

330
00:24:52,420 --> 00:24:54,540
My dad planned it.

331
00:24:54,540 --> 00:24:55,979
You didn't know?

332
00:24:55,979 --> 00:24:57,620
I didn't know.

333
00:24:57,620 --> 00:25:00,720
<i>Then why did you cooperate with his plan?</i>

334
00:25:02,900 --> 00:25:04,559
<i>Your boyfriend was sold,</i>

335
00:25:04,560 --> 00:25:07,759
<i>and you were counting the money for them.</i>

336
00:25:09,379 --> 00:25:11,759
I'm so sad.

337
00:25:14,820 --> 00:25:16,780
No one understands me.

338
00:25:16,780 --> 00:25:18,258
No one is with me.

339
00:25:18,258 --> 00:25:20,680
Even my girlfriend is lying to me.

340
00:25:20,680 --> 00:25:22,279
<i>Sorry.</i>

341
00:25:22,279 --> 00:25:24,660
<i>I didn't know it would become like this.</i>

342
00:25:29,900 --> 00:25:32,640
Didn't you think I would be angry?

343
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:33,900
I've thought about it.

344
00:25:33,900 --> 00:25:36,439
Then why did you still do it?

345
00:25:36,439 --> 00:25:37,860
<i>Think about it.</i>

346
00:25:37,860 --> 00:25:41,919
If my dad takes it as an excuse to separate us, what would you do?

347
00:25:44,599 --> 00:25:47,560
Have you realized the seriousness of this?

348
00:25:47,560 --> 00:25:49,200
Yes.

349
00:25:51,700 --> 00:25:53,360
Think about it.

350
00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:55,780
If we really broke up because of this,

351
00:25:55,780 --> 00:25:57,460
what would you do?

352
00:25:57,460 --> 00:25:59,840
<i>I'll chase you back.</i>

353
00:25:59,840 --> 00:26:00,819
Really?

354
00:26:00,819 --> 00:26:02,139
<i>Yes.</i>

355
00:26:02,139 --> 00:26:04,979
<i>I never thought of breaking up with you.</i>

356
00:26:06,099 --> 00:26:07,640
Then have a try.

357
00:26:07,640 --> 00:26:09,420
Try what?

358
00:26:09,420 --> 00:26:11,180
Just regard that we have broken up.

359
00:26:11,180 --> 00:26:13,080
Try chasing me back.

360
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:16,700
Is it necessary?

361
00:26:16,700 --> 00:26:19,179
Adults should be responsible for their mistakes.

362
00:26:19,179 --> 00:26:21,560
Otherwise, they won't learn a lesson.

363
00:26:24,339 --> 00:26:28,160
Sure enough, you are saying nice thing and trying to trickme casually.

364
00:26:28,160 --> 00:26:30,299
<i>- I'm not.</i>
- Forget it.

365
00:26:31,820 --> 00:26:34,019
<i>Then I'll have a try.</i>

366
00:26:34,019 --> 00:26:35,560
That's a deal.

367
00:26:42,540 --> 00:26:44,099
Nice.

368
00:27:00,820 --> 00:27:03,679
I was trying to reason with him at first,

369
00:27:03,679 --> 00:27:06,078
but then I felt guilty after talking with him.

370
00:27:06,079 --> 00:27:08,600
Then my guilt made me inarticulate.

371
00:27:08,600 --> 00:27:10,840
And it became like this.

372
00:27:13,739 --> 00:27:14,978
You can do it.

373
00:27:14,978 --> 00:27:16,439
It was just a quadratic equation,

374
00:27:16,439 --> 00:27:18,540
but you made it into calculus.

375
00:27:18,540 --> 00:27:20,300
Don't laugh at me.

376
00:27:20,300 --> 00:27:22,460
Think of a solution for me.

377
00:27:22,460 --> 00:27:24,498
Then you should test the waters.

378
00:27:24,498 --> 00:27:26,560
Try what he likes.

379
00:27:26,560 --> 00:27:28,200
Flirt with him.

380
00:28:00,820 --> 00:28:01,978
<i>Morning.</i>

381
00:28:01,978 --> 00:28:04,540
<i>I'm still running in the morning.</i>

382

<i>Fighting.</i>

383
00:28:13,540 --> 00:28:15,139
That's it?

384
00:28:15,139 --> 00:28:17,019
You did it on purpose?

426
00:31:09,920 --> 00:31:11,419
What answer?

427
00:31:12,160 --> 00:31:14,900
<i>Being my boyfriend again.</i>

428
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:18,379
Nope.

429
00:31:19,239 --> 00:31:20,379
Nope?

430
00:31:20,379 --> 00:31:21,819
Ye Shilan,

431
00:31:21,819 --> 00:31:26,139
in your mind, am I so easy to deal with now?

432
00:31:27,040 --> 00:31:28,338
It's not like that.

433
00:31:28,338 --> 00:31:31,900
You just said something nice,

434
00:31:31,900 --> 00:31:34,600
and bought some flowers, then I have to agree?

435
00:31:35,219 --> 00:31:38,100
<i>We have an affection foundation.</i>

436
00:31:38,100 --> 00:31:41,739
<i>And you promised that you'd love me all my life.</i>

437
00:31:41,739 --> 00:31:43,459
I almost forgot if you didn't mention it.

438
00:31:43,459 --> 00:31:46,539
You're just feeling guilty, and are cheating me out of my security deposit.

439
00:31:47,520 --> 00:31:49,800
So you're not sincere?

440
00:31:51,379 --> 00:31:52,459
<i>I like you,</i>

441
00:31:52,459 --> 00:31:54,738
<i>but it's different from agreeing to be your boyfriend.</i>

442
00:31:54,738 --> 00:31:56,439
<i>You also said it.</i>

443
00:31:56,439 --> 00:31:57,939
<i>Don't mix them together.</i>

444
00:31:57,939 --> 00:31:59,900
It's so difficult.

445
00:31:59,900 --> 00:32:02,019
Show me which road to take.

446
00:32:02,019 --> 00:32:04,060
<i>You should find that road yourself yourself.</i>

447
00:32:04,060 --> 00:32:06,140
<i>Is it so easy to give up on me?</i>

448
00:32:06,140 --> 00:32:07,739
No.

449
00:32:10,540 --> 00:32:12,639
Then I will try harder.

450
00:32:13,780 --> 00:32:15,540
Fighting.

451
00:32:26,178 --> 00:32:28,039
Su, take this medicinal liquor.

452
00:32:28,040 --> 00:32:29,560
Thanks, Deputy Director.

453
00:32:31,879 --> 00:32:34,560
I shall leave now. I'll come back to see you.

454
00:32:34,560 --> 00:32:36,919
Okay. Be careful on the way.

455
00:32:36,919 --> 00:32:40,620
Su, tell us when you arrive home.

456
00:32:40,620 --> 00:32:43,359
Okay, Director.

457
00:32:43,359 --> 00:32:45,158
- I shall leave.
- Okay.

458
00:32:45,158 --> 00:32:46,440
- Be careful.
- Bye-bye.

459
00:32:46,440 --> 00:32:47,980
Bye-bye.

460
00:32:59,139 --> 00:33:01,540
Another one is gone.

461
00:33:05,479 --> 00:33:08,879
Director, I want to ask for leave.

462
00:33:10,180 --> 00:33:12,159
Go to visit your boyfriend?

463
00:33:13,400 --> 00:33:16,300
Well, you haven't seen each other for ten days.

464
00:33:16,300 --> 00:33:18,780
But Lu should come here to visit you.

465
00:33:18,780 --> 00:33:21,239
He's making you go back and forth like this.

466
00:33:21,239 --> 00:33:24,719
I did something wrong and made him angry.

467
00:33:24,719 --> 00:33:26,300
It's my fault.

468
00:33:27,099 --> 00:33:29,359
You're so reasonable with your boyfriend?

469
00:33:29,359 --> 00:33:31,619
It's good to be reasonable.

470
00:33:31,619 --> 00:33:33,820
The one who did the wrong thing should bow their head.

471
00:33:33,820 --> 00:33:35,859
That's the rule.

472
00:33:40,060 --> 00:33:42,700
President Gao was taken away by the police yesterday afternoon.

473
00:33:42,700 --> 00:33:45,599
A colleague in my department saw it.

474
00:33:45,599 --> 00:33:47,679
I also heard it.

475
00:33:47,679 --> 00:33:49,979
I also heard that he hired someone to spread the rumors some time ago.

476
00:33:49,979 --> 00:33:53,200
The purpose was to kick President Lu out of the hospital.

477
00:33:53,919 --> 00:33:55,598
I really didn't expect it.

478
00:33:55,599 --> 00:33:58,500
He totally disregarded the reputation of the hospital.

479
00:33:59,979 --> 00:34:04,183
If President Lu is okay, will your uncle be officially appointed?

480
00:34:04,183 --> 00:34:06,700
My uncle was called by the group last night.

481
00:34:06,700 --> 00:34:10,760
The word of formal appointment should come down today.

482
00:34:13,139 --> 00:34:16,500
It seems President Lu came to our hospital to solve this problem.

483
00:34:16,500 --> 00:34:19,980
Yes, my uncle said that the group is engaged in internal anti-corruption.

484
00:34:19,980 --> 00:34:24,260
The matter of President Gao also involved some managers of the group.

485
00:34:24,260 --> 00:34:28,299
President Lu should go to the group to work in the future, right?

486
00:34:38,859 --> 00:34:42,920
Before the rumor between Dr. Ye and you was spread, Gao Xuan found me.

487
00:34:42,920 --> 00:34:46,319
He wanted me to give him more authority after being appointed.

488
00:34:46,319 --> 00:34:50,139
I didn't reply to him. I wanted to know what he wanted to do.

489
00:34:50,139 --> 00:34:54,318
He knew the group wouldn't let him be the president, so he settled for the next best thing.

490
00:34:54,318 --> 00:34:56,719
On the one hand, he wanted to get more from you.

491
00:34:56,719 --> 00:35:02,399
On the other hand, he wanted to know your thoughts through Assistant Lin.

492
00:35:02,399 --> 00:35:08,400
I knew it after the rumor came out, so I told Chairman Lu about it.

493
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:13,079
Compared with this position, I want Anxing Hospital to become better.

494
00:35:13,080 --> 00:35:17,019
Patients can receive the best treatment here.

495
00:35:17,660 --> 00:35:20,840
The group originally intended to let you take over as the president.

496
00:35:20,840 --> 00:35:24,019
I was parachuted in, and was just the layman.

497
00:35:24,019 --> 00:35:26,460
My heart had always felt empty.

498
00:35:27,660 --> 00:35:29,400
But I'm fine now.

499
00:35:29,400 --> 00:35:33,660
I can return the president position to its original owner.

500
00:35:33,660 --> 00:35:36,300
I can finally breathe a sigh of relief.

501
00:35:36,300 --> 00:35:40,279
If there is anything you need help with in the future, just tell me.

502
00:35:40,279 --> 00:35:41,780
Okay.

503
00:35:41,780 --> 00:35:43,930
<i>[Ye Shilan]</i>
I just handed over my work.

504
00:35:43,930 --> 00:35:46,180
I'm on my way back now.

505
00:35:46,180 --> 00:35:48,920
I am officially an unemployed vagrant now.

506
00:35:48,920 --> 00:35:52,600
Don't worry. I can support you.

507
00:35:52,600 --> 00:35:56,578
You really know how to coax me now. I'm immune to it.

508
00:35:56,578 --> 00:35:58,499
I don't believe it.

509
00:35:58,499 --> 00:36:01,660
If you like someone, who would say too much about love?

510
00:36:01,660 --> 00:36:04,220
How about you try to say a few words?

511
00:36:04,220 --> 00:36:07,119
I don't want to be fooled by you.

512
00:36:07,119 --> 00:36:10,960
Well... since you've settled President Gao's issue,

513
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:15,880
Then do I not have to pretend to have broken up with you in front of others?

514
00:36:15,880 --> 00:36:20,120
Whatever. The thing between us is not settled yet.

515
00:36:20,120 --> 00:36:23,198
I know. You don't need to remind me.

516
00:36:24,920 --> 00:36:26,399
Have you read Weibo?

517
00:36:26,399 --> 00:36:29,160
No. I haven't read Weibo for a long time.

518
00:36:29,160 --> 00:36:32,538
Have a look. You are trending again.

519
00:36:35,680 --> 00:36:39,080
<i>[The female doctor in Anxing Hospital was wronged]</i>

520
00:36:42,820 --> 00:36:44,900
<i>I told you this was not trustworthy.</i>

521
00:36:44,900 --> 00:36:47,299
<i>There was no evidence, just rumors.</i>

522
00:36:47,299 --> 00:36:49,099
<i>Sure enough, she was framed by the villain.</i>

523
00:36:49,099 --> 00:36:51,359
<i>Be smart when reading gossip.</i>

524
00:36:51,360 --> 00:36:53,500
<i>And don't be too quick to judge about morals.</i>

525
00:36:53,500 --> 00:36:55,139
<i>Are you morally perfect?</i>

526
00:36:55,139 --> 00:36:57,059
<i>She went to be a doctor in the village.</i>

527
00:36:57,059 --> 00:36:58,878
<i>She is kind and beautiful.</i>

528
00:36:58,879 --> 00:37:01,540
<i>Those who blamed her are either jealous that she has a boyfriend,</i>

529
00:37:01,540 --> 00:37:04,279
<i>or are diffident because they are not as excellent as her boyfriend.</i>

530
00:37:04,279 --> 00:37:06,678
<i>I took my baby to see this doctor's clinic.</i>

531
00:37:06,679 --> 00:37:09,318
<i>She is very patient. She is trustworthy.</i>

532
00:37:09,318 --> 00:37:12,660
<i>The content of the rumors is clearly a manifestation of the love between the two.</i>

533
00:37:12,660 --> 00:37:15,359
<i>I suddenly found myself knocked senseless.</i>

534
00:37:15,359 --> 00:37:18,858
<i>Those who scold without thinking come out and apologize. Stop being a shrinking turtle.</i>

535
00:37:18,858 --> 00:37:21,699
<i>Is this the doctor who saved people in the video?</i>

536
00:37:21,699 --> 00:37:25,418
<i>No need to say anything. Click a thumb for the good doctor.</i>

537
00:37:33,780 --> 00:37:37,940
Lin Kaiwen told me. This reversal of public opinion was planned by Lu Zhaoxi himself.

538
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:43,400
Not only Weibo, but all the forums where the rumors were spread before have also been rectified.

539
00:37:43,420 --> 00:37:45,878
He not only found the video of you saving people,

540
00:37:45,879 --> 00:37:49,158
he actually asked Ji Zixing to repost related Weibo.

541
00:37:49,159 --> 00:37:52,099
<i>The influence is overwhelming.</i>

542
00:37:52,099 --> 00:37:55,559
He always considers me first no matter what things he encounters.

543
00:37:55,559 --> 00:37:59,700
I must have done something great in my previous life.

544
00:37:59,700 --> 00:38:02,760
<i>You also consider him first, right?</i>

545
00:38:02,760 --> 00:38:05,819
Have you not seen each other for almost half a month?

546
00:38:05,819 --> 00:38:07,760
Yes.

547
00:38:07,760 --> 00:38:09,660
I want to go back this weekend.

548
00:38:09,660 --> 00:38:11,039
<i>I think it's good.</i>

549
00:38:11,040 --> 00:38:13,839
The effect of meeting is definitely a hundred times better than calling.

550
00:38:13,840 --> 00:38:16,819
Maybe Lu Zhaoxi will surrender soon.

551
00:38:16,819 --> 00:38:20,360
<i>With such a good boyfriend, you need to be more active.</i>

552
00:38:20,360 --> 00:38:22,519
I'm active enough.

553
00:38:22,519 --> 00:38:26,978
Then be even more active. Liberate yourself.

554
00:38:26,978 --> 00:38:32,120
It's not good for girls to take the initiative in that kind of thing, right?

555
00:38:32,120 --> 00:38:34,719
Look at you. You misunderstood me.

556
00:38:34,719 --> 00:38:38,940
I mean, Lu Zhaoxi is not a president anymore.

557
00:38:38,940 --> 00:38:40,820
And you're back in Taoyuan Village.

558
00:38:40,820 --> 00:38:42,450
Don't forget your nature.

559
00:38:42,450 --> 00:38:44,770
You are an unruly wild girl.

560
00:38:44,778 --> 00:38:48,160
Stop. Don't trick me.

561
00:38:48,210 --> 00:38:49,730
<i>I'm not joking.</i>

562
00:38:49,730 --> 00:38:54,020
<i>I think Lu Zhaoxi likes that kind of you.</i>

563
00:38:57,039 --> 00:38:59,119
Granny Feng.

564
00:38:59,119 --> 00:39:01,438
Get a pot of hot water when you get back.

565
00:39:01,439 --> 00:39:03,279
Pour this medicine into the water.

566
00:39:03,280 --> 00:39:04,919
Soak your feet into it for twenty minutes.

567
00:39:04,919 --> 00:39:07,159
Then clean your feet and reapply the medicine.

568
00:39:07,159 --> 00:39:10,379
After a few days, a layer of skin will be off. Then you won't be itchy.

569
00:39:10,379 --> 00:39:13,239
Okay, I know. I'll try it at home.

570
00:39:13,239 --> 00:39:15,039
- Thank you, Dr. Ye.
- You're welcome.

571
00:39:15,039 --> 00:39:16,360
- Thanks.
- Be careful.

572
00:39:16,360 --> 00:39:18,679
- Okay. Okay.
- Be careful.

573
00:39:23,500 --> 00:39:25,800
<i>[Lu Zhaoxi]</i>

574
00:39:38,360 --> 00:39:40,519
Director, I want to ask for leave.

575
00:39:40,519 --> 00:39:42,060
What's wrong?

576
00:39:42,060 --> 00:39:44,978
My boyfriend is here. I want to find him.

577
00:39:44,978 --> 00:39:47,278
- Go ahead.
- Thank you, Director.
