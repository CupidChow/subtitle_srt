17
00:03:02,700 --> 00:03:06,020
Why didn't you tell me you were coming? What if I left early?

18
00:03:06,020 --> 00:03:07,427
I already had it timed.

19
00:03:07,428 --> 00:03:09,230
You're too confident.

20
00:03:09,230 --> 00:03:12,799
Yeah. I arrived half an hour early.

21
00:03:14,014 --> 00:03:16,600
Then you should have called me earlier.

22
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:18,842
I didn't want you to be rushed.

23
00:03:18,842 --> 00:03:21,399
You should have told me.

24
00:03:23,428 --> 00:03:26,210
I lied to you. I just arrived.

25
00:03:28,228 --> 00:03:29,860
Let's go.

26
00:03:40,250 --> 00:03:42,485
Did you sleep well last night?

27
00:03:42,485 --> 00:03:44,379
Yes, I did.

28
00:03:45,071 --> 00:03:48,010
Why do I feel like you're not well?

29
00:03:49,142 --> 00:03:51,370
I was thinking.

30
00:03:52,459 --> 00:03:54,119
What's up?

31
00:03:54,857 --> 00:03:59,357
Let's keep our relationship from our colleagues.

32
00:03:59,357 --> 00:04:01,820
I mean for now.

33
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:05,085
You're afraid people will talk, right?

34
00:04:07,085 --> 00:04:10,160
And it'll affect your work.

35
00:04:12,857 --> 00:04:16,420
Or do you think it's not appropriate?

36
00:04:17,579 --> 00:04:22,619
No. We can't tell everyone we're together when we see them,

37
00:04:22,619 --> 00:04:25,057
although I'd like to do that.

38
00:04:25,757 --> 00:04:27,600
We can tell people we trust.

39
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:32,109
For example, Qiao Yu and Assistant Lin. We can tell them.

40
00:04:33,614 --> 00:04:36,814
Won't it be easy to be discovered when I drive you to work?

41
00:04:36,814 --> 00:04:38,427
A bit.

42
00:04:38,427 --> 00:04:40,842
You get up so early to pick me up for work every day.

43
00:04:40,842 --> 00:04:43,270
I feel bad for you.

44
00:04:43,270 --> 00:04:46,584
Fine. Then I'll do it once in a while.

45
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:53,200
Let me out when we're close to the hospital. I'll walk.

46
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:07,459
You want me to get off now? It's too far.

47
00:05:07,459 --> 00:05:09,884
Are you silly? Why do you have to walk?

48
00:05:09,885 --> 00:05:13,557
You're my assistant now. You do the driving.

49
00:05:14,557 --> 00:05:16,790
Your brain is more agile.

50
00:05:16,790 --> 00:05:19,100
- You want to drive?
- Sure.

51
00:05:19,100 --> 00:05:20,860
Come on.

52
00:05:22,979 --> 00:05:27,327
About this audit, the group needs us to cooperate fully with them

53
00:05:27,327 --> 00:05:30,041
to regulate the hospital.

54
00:05:30,041 --> 00:05:32,042
There may be some targeted questions.

55
00:05:32,042 --> 00:05:35,942
Manage your time and be ready for inquiries.

56
00:05:35,942 --> 00:05:40,800
Mr. Jin has been known to be picky.

57
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:43,199
The audit is being led by him.

58
00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:46,759
It doesn't look like a routine audit,

59
00:05:46,759 --> 00:05:51,399
but like he must find out something.

60
00:05:51,399 --> 00:05:53,219
It's just a check on the accounts.

61
00:05:53,219 --> 00:05:57,042
If everything is okay, there's nothing to worry about.

62
00:05:57,900 --> 00:05:59,959
Yeah, I guess.

63
00:05:59,959 --> 00:06:02,720
But I'm afraid some people have ulterior motives,

64
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:05,985
which would damage our hospital's reputation.

65
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,240
If there's a problem, it's a personal one.

66
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:12,279
Dealing with it is better for the hospital's reputation.

67
00:06:12,780 --> 00:06:17,579
Yeah. Associate Dean Xu, you have a point.

68
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:22,959
Ye Shilan, come in.

69
00:06:26,940 --> 00:06:28,700
What's up?

70
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:32,140
Hand.

71
00:06:37,100 --> 00:06:39,659
Where'd you get these from?

72
00:06:39,659 --> 00:06:43,084
A doctor downstairs is getting married. He gave them to me.

73
00:06:46,079 --> 00:06:47,839
Sweet?

74
00:06:49,100 --> 00:06:50,439
I want it, too.

75
00:06:50,439 --> 00:06:51,750
Where's yours?

76
00:06:51,750 --> 00:06:53,760
I gave them all to you.

77
00:06:55,139 --> 00:06:56,480
Fine.

Should I tell the president about it?

I don't mean to pry.

You seemed very serious when you answered the phone.

112
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:04,840
Is it a habit of writers to observe people?

113
00:09:04,840 --> 00:09:06,713
It's my habit anyway.

114
00:09:06,713 --> 00:09:09,541
I liked sitting in the back corner of the classroom in school,

115
00:09:09,542 --> 00:09:11,220
because I could see everything.

116
00:09:11,220 --> 00:09:14,559
I could see what everyone was doing.

117
00:09:14,559 --> 00:09:17,919
Didn't you catch them if they fell in love?

118
00:09:17,919 --> 00:09:21,570
You're right. But then, it gave me a lot of inspiration.

119
00:09:33,699 --> 00:09:36,859
If you're not rushed, you can slow down. Try to chew it.

120
00:09:36,859 --> 00:09:38,760
Make it a good habit.

121
00:09:43,139 --> 00:09:45,259
Do you exercise usually?

122
00:09:45,259 --> 00:09:46,739
Seldom.

123
00:09:46,739 --> 00:09:50,099
You consume so much sugar and you don't gain weight?

124
00:09:50,099 --> 00:09:53,384
It's in my DNA. My parents don't gain weight easily either.

125
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:56,140
I'm jealous.

126
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:07,858
By the way, there are good reviews about the business part of my new chapter.

127
00:10:07,858 --> 00:10:08,959
I saw it.

128
00:10:08,959 --> 00:10:12,599
So soon? Are you following my novel?

129
00:10:12,599 --> 00:10:16,500
I just wanted to know if I was helping.

130
00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:18,569
You saw that reader help me reply to the mean comments.

131
00:10:18,569 --> 00:10:20,180
He even used the Dunning-Kruger effect.

132
00:10:20,180 --> 00:10:23,240
Let that prick get off the mountain of ignorance.

133
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:25,320
It made me happy.

134
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:28,960
I know. That reader is me.

135
00:10:35,300 --> 00:10:37,220
Thank you.

136
00:10:37,740 --> 00:10:41,860
It's my pleasure to be thanked by the author in person.

137
00:10:44,280 --> 00:10:47,158
I'll get to work now. Take your time.

138
00:11:55,519 --> 00:11:56,939
Have you been waiting for a long time?

139
00:11:56,939 --> 00:11:58,540
No.

140
00:11:58,600 --> 00:12:02,900
We have plenty of time before the movie. Got plans for dinner?

141
00:12:02,919 --> 00:12:05,419
I know there's a great restaurant here.

142
00:12:05,419 --> 00:12:07,019
Okay.

143
00:12:10,220 --> 00:12:12,540
You're pretty good at it.

144
00:12:13,640 --> 00:12:15,719
I've done it before.

145
00:12:15,719 --> 00:12:17,519
That was different.

146
00:12:17,519 --> 00:12:19,260
I was nervous at that time.

147
00:12:19,260 --> 00:12:20,518
I didn't see that.

148
00:12:20,518 --> 00:12:23,119
I was faking it. My palms were sweaty.

149
00:12:23,119 --> 00:12:24,859
Well, you're pretty good.

150
00:12:24,859 --> 00:12:26,484
Not as good as you.

151
00:12:26,484 --> 00:12:28,571
A kiss can be described as a contact accident.

152
00:12:28,571 --> 00:12:30,942
You called a kiss an accident.

153
00:12:30,942 --> 00:12:33,259
Stop it.

154
00:12:33,900 --> 00:12:35,919
All right. I'll stop.

155
00:12:37,919 --> 00:12:42,759
By the way, do you know what kind of tea my best girlfriend said we were?

156
00:12:42,759 --> 00:12:44,290
Tea?

157
00:12:44,290 --> 00:12:46,327
It's just an adjective.

158
00:12:46,327 --> 00:12:48,260
There's one called green tea.

159
00:12:48,260 --> 00:12:51,980
She said we were a rational tea.

160
00:12:51,980 --> 00:12:54,200
What does this mean?

161
00:12:54,740 --> 00:12:59,418
She meant, we both like each other, and there's something between us,

162
00:12:59,418 --> 00:13:04,999
however, we tell ourselves to be careful and it's not real with reason.

163
00:13:04,999 --> 00:13:07,819
She's so right about us.

164
00:13:08,420 --> 00:13:12,749
I remember you once told me your best girlfriend was engaged in literature.

165
00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:17,800
Since you've become my boyfriend,

166
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:20,619
I'll let you know more.

167
00:13:20,619 --> 00:13:22,739
- It's my perk?
- Do you want to know?

168
00:13:22,739 --> 00:13:24,100
No.

169
00:13:27,080 --> 00:13:30,139
Okay. All right. I'm listening.

170
00:13:34,300 --> 00:13:38,870
Some time ago, she put a customer's personality in her novel.

171
00:13:38,870 --> 00:13:41,510
By coincidence, that customer caught on.

172
00:13:41,510 --> 00:13:43,970
So they fell out over it.

173
00:13:43,978 --> 00:13:47,099
Novels are fictional. No names were mentioned.

174
00:13:47,099 --> 00:13:49,499
That customer must have been too sensitive.

175
00:13:49,499 --> 00:13:52,579
It just so happens that their names were the same.

176
00:13:52,579 --> 00:13:56,120
Really? What a small world.

177
00:13:56,640 --> 00:14:00,990
So she works in a coffee shop to observe life?

178
00:14:01,480 --> 00:14:03,041
That's on the one hand.

179
00:14:03,041 --> 00:14:07,114
On the other hand, she wanted to have a fixed income.

180
00:14:07,114 --> 00:14:09,810
So that she wouldn't be stressed about writing.

181
00:14:23,185 --> 00:14:26,427
By the way, there is a free clinic in a mountain village this weekend.

182
00:14:26,427 --> 00:14:29,320
I'm going to study and learn about it from them.

183
00:14:30,039 --> 00:14:34,099
Well... do you want me to go with you?

184
00:14:34,099 --> 00:14:36,784
No. It's not appropriate.

185
00:14:39,257 --> 00:14:42,257
Anxing Hospital does have the tradition

186
00:14:42,257 --> 00:14:44,957
of organizing regular free clinics every year.

187
00:14:44,957 --> 00:14:47,200
Where are you going?

188
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:50,884
- Taoyuan Village.
- Taoyuan Village?

189
00:14:52,900 --> 00:14:57,199
They gave me several places. It seemed like we haven't been there.

190
00:15:01,657 --> 00:15:04,228
I miss the director and the guys so much.

191
00:15:05,470 --> 00:15:11,271
How about... I go with you in a personal capacity?

192
00:15:14,259 --> 00:15:19,210
If you go with us, it's hard to say it is a personal trip.

193
00:15:20,500 --> 00:15:22,080
Right.

194
00:15:23,980 --> 00:15:29,258
But I put you on the list of doctors without your consent.

195
00:15:29,258 --> 00:15:31,240
You're not mad, are you?

196
00:15:31,240 --> 00:15:33,280
Really?

197
00:15:34,180 --> 00:15:36,656
I find you're such a child.

198
00:15:36,656 --> 00:15:39,170
What? I'm childish because I like you.

199
00:15:39,170 --> 00:15:40,578
I don't want to hear it.

200
00:15:40,578 --> 00:15:43,099
Fine. Will you go? I'll call Assistant Lin if you won't.

201
00:15:43,099 --> 00:15:44,719
I will.

202
00:15:47,519 --> 00:15:54,159
Tell me first if you want me to go with you.

203
00:15:56,479 --> 00:15:59,500
Yeah. You've been there for support.

204
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:02,000
You know everything about that place.

205
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:06,440
I can't think of a better person than you.

206
00:16:07,300 --> 00:16:09,400
President, you're wise.

207
00:16:11,279 --> 00:16:16,113
However, even without a free clinic, I'd decided to go there for team building.

208
00:16:16,113 --> 00:16:19,900
It's a bit weird to go to Taoyuan Village for team building.

209
00:16:19,900 --> 00:16:21,285
It's not weird.

210
00:16:21,285 --> 00:16:24,650
There are only two people for the president's team building.

211
00:16:27,279 --> 00:16:29,660
Isn't that a date?

212
00:16:30,179 --> 00:16:32,057
This is called love's team building.

213
00:16:34,740 --> 00:16:39,199
Since you're doing great, I'll give you another one.

214
00:16:54,019 --> 00:16:55,479
<i>Don't you want to keep it secret?</i>

215
00:16:55,479 --> 00:16:59,319
<i>Is it okay to post such a Moment?</i>

216
00:16:59,319 --> 00:17:02,779
<i>Don't you know Moments can set groups?</i>

217
00:17:03,259 --> 00:17:05,259
<i>Which group am I in?</i>

218
00:17:07,379 --> 00:17:11,279
<i>The informed group. It's a circle of friends who can chat and appreciate it.</i>

219
00:17:12,540 --> 00:17:16,219
<i>Well, as a party involved, I can't turn a blind eye to it.</i>

220
00:17:18,310 --> 00:17:20,971
<i>[The inept adviser liked it.]</i>

221
00:17:34,971 --> 00:17:36,930
Did you think the film was funny?

222
00:17:36,930 --> 00:17:38,213
Not really.

223
00:17:38,213 --> 00:17:39,819
I saw you laughing the whole time.

224
00:17:39,819 --> 00:17:41,858
I was laughing with you.

225
00:17:41,858 --> 00:17:43,685
Am I really that good?

226
00:17:43,685 --> 00:17:46,740
I thought our laugh thresholds were different.

227
00:17:48,859 --> 00:17:50,720
Do you want dessert?

228
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:52,760
I can't afford it.

229
00:17:52,760 --> 00:17:54,499
It's on me.

230
00:17:54,499 --> 00:17:57,939
What I'm saying is, that's too many calories.

231
00:17:57,939 --> 00:17:59,639
You're not fat.

232
00:17:59,639 --> 00:18:03,958
But if you have time, you can do some exercises to increase your basal metabolic rate.

233
00:18:03,958 --> 00:18:06,427
I bought a gym membership before.

234
00:18:06,427 --> 00:18:08,560
But I failed to keep at it.

235
00:18:09,110 --> 00:18:11,870
I can give you a push if you like.

236
00:18:11,870 --> 00:18:15,370
Good. We can try that later.

237
00:18:21,342 --> 00:18:23,590
What did you post?

238
00:18:23,590 --> 00:18:28,239
"Life is still so beautiful."

239
00:18:30,771 --> 00:18:33,380
Why didn't I see you post anything?

240
00:18:33,380 --> 00:18:36,649
I seldom post Moments. I guess you missed them.

241
00:18:36,649 --> 00:18:39,300
No. I always check your page.

242
00:18:39,300 --> 00:18:41,250
I didn't see you post any Moments.

243
00:18:42,239 --> 00:18:44,039
You blocked me.

244
00:18:44,039 --> 00:18:48,118
I forgot. I'm releasing you now. I'm sorry.

245
00:18:48,118 --> 00:18:51,179
Tell me what you did behind my back.

246
00:18:53,960 --> 00:18:56,539
Done, you're out.

247
00:18:59,285 --> 00:19:01,919
<i>[Many good reviews. It's a day to update the novel.]</i>

248
00:19:01,920 --> 00:19:03,999
It's amazing.

249
00:19:03,999 --> 00:19:06,460
- Guess what I'm reading.
- What?

250
00:19:06,460 --> 00:19:09,918
My best girlfriend posted a Moment. Assistant Lin liked it.

251
00:19:09,918 --> 00:19:12,941
Assistant Lin? Do they know each other?

252
00:19:12,941 --> 00:19:14,899
I don't think they just know each other.

253
00:19:14,899 --> 00:19:19,120
People who can see this Moment are insiders.

254
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:28,000
Turns out Assistant Lin's English name is Kevin.

255
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,439
I changed his name to Assistant Lin when I had his WeChat.

256
00:19:30,439 --> 00:19:32,340
I didn't notice it.

257
00:19:32,340 --> 00:19:35,979
It's easy to remember. Just like his Chinese name.

258
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:40,200
I've been calling him Assistant Lin. I don't know what his real name was.

259
00:19:41,099 --> 00:19:44,100
His Chinese name is Lin Kaiwen.

260
00:19:45,900 --> 00:19:48,799
It's really dark under the lights.

261
00:19:50,580 --> 00:19:53,638
It fits. Everything fits.

262
00:19:53,638 --> 00:19:56,338
Kevin is Lin Kaiwen.

263
00:19:56,338 --> 00:20:00,819
His idea of asking Lu Zhaoxi to swim was from my novel.

264
00:20:00,819 --> 00:20:02,379
Aren't you annoyed with him?

265
00:20:02,379 --> 00:20:03,999
Why did you have his WeChat?

266
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,342
He even liked your Moment.

267
00:20:06,342 --> 00:20:07,679
Didn't I tell you?

268
00:20:07,679 --> 00:20:09,560
No.

269
00:20:10,371 --> 00:20:12,419
He's a man who can correct his mistakes.

270
00:20:12,419 --> 00:20:13,857
He's quite sincere.

271
00:20:13,857 --> 00:20:15,470
I found he was nice after I spent time with him.

272
00:20:15,470 --> 00:20:18,971
I'm asking him to be my advisor in writing the business parts.

273
00:20:20,114 --> 00:20:21,971
Wait.

274
00:20:21,971 --> 00:20:23,927
<i>My friend is your old reader.</i>

275
00:20:23,927 --> 00:20:27,498
<i>He reminded me that the villain had some characteristics similar to mine.</i>

276
00:20:27,498 --> 00:20:29,380
<i>That's why I looked for it.</i>

277
00:20:29,380 --> 00:20:30,838
<i>And then locked onto you.</i>

278
00:20:30,839 --> 00:20:33,618
<i>I was wondering why you liked novels about bossy CEOs.</i>

279
00:20:33,618 --> 00:20:37,160
<i>Xiaoyan is a character in a novel I wrote a year ago.</i>

280
00:20:37,160 --> 00:20:38,785
<i>How do you know?</i>

281
00:20:38,785 --> 00:20:42,460
<i>My friend said you wrote well and recommended me to read it.</i>

282
00:20:42,460 --> 00:20:46,029
<i>I'm a little curious. Can you read this kind of novel?</i>

283
00:20:46,029 --> 00:20:48,357
<i>I'm not against them.</i>

284
00:20:50,159 --> 00:20:51,500
What's wrong?

285
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:55,684
Do you know the words "making friends out of thin air"?

286
00:20:55,684 --> 00:20:58,600
I do know something about that culture.

287
00:20:58,600 --> 00:21:00,970
I don't mean that, I mean friends of friends.

288
00:21:00,971 --> 00:21:03,730
Lin Kaiwen told me he had a friend who liked my novels.

289
00:21:03,730 --> 00:21:05,313
That's why he noticed me.

290
00:21:05,314 --> 00:21:06,885
The third time is the charm.

291
00:21:06,885 --> 00:21:11,185
The swimming plot is from another novel.

292
00:21:11,185 --> 00:21:13,171
I don't get it.

293
00:21:13,171 --> 00:21:16,639
In short, Lin Kaiwen doesn't have that friend.

294
00:21:16,639 --> 00:21:20,180
He's the one who liked my novels.

295
00:21:22,840 --> 00:21:24,456
No wonder Lu Zhaoxi said

296
00:21:24,457 --> 00:21:26,580
that when he talked about personal affairs and feelings

297
00:21:26,580 --> 00:21:28,239
his brain was very mysterious.

298
00:21:28,239 --> 00:21:31,599
Now that I think about it, he's a lot like you.

299
00:21:31,599 --> 00:21:33,756
Yezi, pretend not to know about it.

300
00:21:33,756 --> 00:21:35,149
Same goes for your boyfriend.

301
00:21:35,149 --> 00:21:37,185
What do you want?

302
00:21:37,185 --> 00:21:40,514
Of course, I want to...

303
00:21:40,514 --> 00:21:43,685
tease him.

304
00:21:51,099 --> 00:21:52,880
Come in.

305
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:55,160
Is it heavy? Here. Let me.

306
00:21:55,160 --> 00:21:56,942
It's okay. I can do it.

307
00:21:56,942 --> 00:21:59,780
You can do it, doesn't mean you can't ask your boyfriend for help.

308
00:21:59,780 --> 00:22:02,000
You're the president now.

309
00:22:02,580 --> 00:22:04,119
I...

310
00:22:09,119 --> 00:22:11,619
I feel like you're hijacking me.

311
00:22:11,619 --> 00:22:13,730
What hijacking?

312
00:22:13,730 --> 00:22:17,300
You're making it hard for me to take you as my girlfriend.

313
00:22:17,940 --> 00:22:21,740
Isn't it good to keep life and work separate?

314
00:22:22,728 --> 00:22:25,499
People are not machines. Why make it so clear?

315
00:22:25,499 --> 00:22:29,139
Besides, it's okay if there are no problems in principle.

316
00:22:30,420 --> 00:22:32,060
Right.

317
00:22:32,700 --> 00:22:35,460
Is that me digging into a dead end?

318
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:40,800
So, what is it?

319
00:22:40,800 --> 00:22:44,227
It's pieris. It can be kept longer.

320
00:22:44,227 --> 00:22:45,899
You're trying to save me money again?

321
00:22:45,899 --> 00:22:47,227
It's expensive, okay?

322
00:22:47,227 --> 00:22:49,280
Then why don't you buy flowers?

323
00:22:50,759 --> 00:22:52,750
Is it a matter of principle?

324
00:22:52,750 --> 00:22:54,414
Well.

325
00:22:56,785 --> 00:22:57,857
Doesn't count.

326
00:22:57,857 --> 00:23:01,080
Think about it yourself. I'll be outside.

327
00:23:02,139 --> 00:23:05,599
You showed me what I taught you. Little genius.

328
00:23:16,900 --> 00:23:19,260
- Assistant Lin.
- Assistant Ye, is the president here?

329
00:23:19,260 --> 00:23:20,930
Yeah.

330
00:23:25,099 --> 00:23:26,640
<i>Come in.</i>

331
00:23:33,940 --> 00:23:37,079
Are you and Dr. Ye...

332
00:23:37,079 --> 00:23:39,080
Yes.

333
00:23:39,080 --> 00:23:40,800
Congratulations.

334
00:23:42,042 --> 00:23:46,230
It's the first time I've heard such formal congratulations.

335
00:23:46,230 --> 00:23:48,613
Because I always thought you two were a matter of time.

336
00:23:48,613 --> 00:23:52,000
So, you seem to like going through the process.

337
00:23:52,985 --> 00:23:56,040
I have to say you're pretty good at that.

338
00:23:56,040 --> 00:23:58,330
Does practice bring true knowledge?

339
00:23:58,330 --> 00:24:00,960
Mainly reading and studying.

340
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:02,520
What books do you read?

341
00:24:02,520 --> 00:24:04,785
Tell me some books to read.

342
00:24:04,785 --> 00:24:07,120
You don't need them anymore.

343
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:09,050
Who said that?

344
00:24:09,050 --> 00:24:11,940
I think it's more important to work on the relationship.

345
00:24:11,940 --> 00:24:15,120
I have no say in that.

346
00:24:19,019 --> 00:24:23,379
You've been busy with the audit all these days. It's tough.

347
00:24:23,379 --> 00:24:24,980
Yeah, it is.

348
00:24:24,980 --> 00:24:28,071
But as you can see, there's not much progress.

349
00:24:28,885 --> 00:24:32,213
The audit was meant to scare someone and go through the process.

350
00:24:32,213 --> 00:24:34,556
It's very likely that nothing will be found in the end.

351
00:24:34,556 --> 00:24:37,250
But we have to find a way to make the old foxes move on.

352
00:24:37,250 --> 00:24:39,514
So that they expose their tails.

353
00:24:41,414 --> 00:24:43,540
Why not create some smoke?

354
00:24:44,257 --> 00:24:47,214
Make smoke? It's likely we'll choke ourselves.

355
00:24:47,214 --> 00:24:50,520
Well, we have to deal with that when it happens.

356
00:24:55,060 --> 00:24:59,259
Manager Wu, I understand your concern.

357
00:24:59,259 --> 00:25:03,090
But it's the routine of the Audit Department.

358
00:25:03,090 --> 00:25:07,660
Right. The way we cooperate remains the same.

359
00:25:07,660 --> 00:25:11,739
Don't worry. No one can take our interests.

360
00:25:11,739 --> 00:25:15,239
The rabbit bites when it's desperate. Right?

361
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:18,010
Okay.

362
00:25:18,010 --> 00:25:20,710
Let's be in touch if anything comes up.

363
00:25:41,619 --> 00:25:43,918
- Here. Drink.
- Okay.

364
00:25:43,918 --> 00:25:46,456
Have fun sometimes no matter how busy you are.

365
00:25:46,456 --> 00:25:48,238
Without your health, nothing else matters.

366
00:25:48,238 --> 00:25:50,060
You're right.

367
00:25:51,300 --> 00:25:53,927
Accounts of the hospital are a bit complicated.

368
00:25:53,927 --> 00:25:56,714
The audit team won't leave for two or three days.

369
00:25:56,714 --> 00:25:59,300
It's going to be a long battle.

370
00:25:59,300 --> 00:26:03,760
Yeah. They do an audit every year.

371
00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:06,339
Why does it feel different this year?

372
00:26:06,339 --> 00:26:08,199
Yeah.

373
00:26:08,739 --> 00:26:10,720
I don't know why.

374
00:26:12,200 --> 00:26:14,957
Does it have something to do with the new president?

375
00:26:14,957 --> 00:26:16,842
What do you mean?

376
00:26:17,660 --> 00:26:21,060
I heard President Lu came to our hospital

377
00:26:21,060 --> 00:26:23,900
to make his resume look better.

378
00:26:23,900 --> 00:26:25,971
A new broom sweeps clean.

379
00:26:25,971 --> 00:26:28,749
The first one is Chief Huang. It was to win hearts and minds.

380
00:26:28,749 --> 00:26:32,179
The second one is the documentary. That was for the performance.

381
00:26:32,179 --> 00:26:38,810
About the third one, will he show his means in the audit?

382
00:26:42,180 --> 00:26:46,119
Well, now that I'm hearing it, I guess it makes sense.

383
00:26:46,119 --> 00:26:48,384
Look at the audit team,

384
00:26:48,384 --> 00:26:52,228
they won't stop until they find something.

385
00:26:53,460 --> 00:26:56,039
In previous years,

386
00:26:56,039 --> 00:26:59,270
it was the current president who checked his accounts.

387
00:26:59,270 --> 00:27:03,314
This year, it's the current president examining previous accounts.

388
00:27:03,314 --> 00:27:06,660
This is completely freeing hands and feet.
<i>(Idiom: to have free rein)</i>

389
00:27:09,820 --> 00:27:13,920
Assistant Lin, anyway, we both work for other people.

390
00:27:13,920 --> 00:27:16,728
Why don't you tell me what's on your mind?

391
00:27:18,200 --> 00:27:20,799
I was thinking, Chairman Lu and the president

392
00:27:20,800 --> 00:27:25,459
should know you've always been in charge of the hospital's finance.

393
00:27:25,459 --> 00:27:29,740
- Yeah.
- Why do I feel it's a bit personal for you?

394
00:27:30,879 --> 00:27:32,519
Don't get me wrong.

395
00:27:32,519 --> 00:27:35,879
I don't mean you have a problem.

396
00:27:35,879 --> 00:27:38,080
It's okay.

397
00:27:38,080 --> 00:27:40,441
You're around the president every day.

398
00:27:40,441 --> 00:27:44,480
It should be right if you feel this way.

399
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:48,356
I was making my judgment. Don't take it seriously.

400
00:27:48,356 --> 00:27:49,740
I'm not afraid.

401
00:27:49,740 --> 00:27:53,680
I've been through everything in all my years.

402
00:27:54,499 --> 00:27:56,079
Drink.

403
00:27:59,060 --> 00:28:01,969
<i>Hello. Please enjoy it.</i>

404
00:28:02,660 --> 00:28:04,780
Jiajia.

405
00:28:04,780 --> 00:28:08,199
What a surprise! You don't visit me often.

406
00:28:08,199 --> 00:28:10,498
You're busy. You don't have time to talk to me.

407
00:28:10,498 --> 00:28:13,280
I'll see you when you get home.

408
00:28:15,680 --> 00:28:18,457
Two lattes, please. To go.

409
00:28:18,457 --> 00:28:20,780
Why don't you just order takeout?

410
00:28:20,780 --> 00:28:22,757
I was just eating out.

411
00:28:22,757 --> 00:28:25,050
With your boyfriend?

412
00:28:25,050 --> 00:28:26,780
Where's he?

413
00:28:26,780 --> 00:28:28,541
I asked him to go first.

414
00:28:28,541 --> 00:28:31,542
We'll be exposed if we walk together.

415
00:28:32,490 --> 00:28:36,385
You're really in a secret relationship.

416
00:28:37,759 --> 00:28:39,630
- 70 yuan.
- Thank you.

417
00:28:39,630 --> 00:28:45,020
Gossip is a fearful thing. What isn't?

418
00:28:49,085 --> 00:28:51,480
You haven't made it clear to him yet?

419
00:28:51,480 --> 00:28:55,900
No. He seems to be very busy with work recently.

420
00:28:55,900 --> 00:29:00,039
That's true. He's busy with our group's audit.

421
00:29:14,299 --> 00:29:16,442
- President Gao.
- Ye.

422
00:29:16,442 --> 00:29:20,040
- You bought coffee for the president?
- Yes.

423
00:29:20,040 --> 00:29:23,219
I thought we can make coffee in the break room.

424
00:29:23,219 --> 00:29:26,280
The president wants a change of taste sometimes.

425
00:29:26,985 --> 00:29:30,928
- Offer the president several varieties of coffee beans.
- Okay.

426
00:29:43,160 --> 00:29:47,760
Ye, I heard you gave the president some good suggestions.

427
00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:51,509
Doctors have benefited from it. That's good.

428
00:29:51,509 --> 00:29:55,499
The president asked for my opinion. I just told him some of my ideas.

429
00:29:55,499 --> 00:29:59,390
That means the president trusts you.

430
00:30:00,157 --> 00:30:03,039
You proposed to support Taoyuan Village, right?

431
00:30:03,040 --> 00:30:06,257
No. It was decided by the president.

432
00:30:15,319 --> 00:30:19,779
Tomorrow we will go to the free clinic organized by Taoyuan Village Hospital.

433
00:30:20,928 --> 00:30:23,199
Let's eat together when I get back.

434
00:30:23,199 --> 00:30:25,314
Take care of yourself, Mom.

435
00:30:33,100 --> 00:30:36,679
<i>I'm not a flower. I'm a leaf.</i>

436
00:30:36,679 --> 00:30:39,619
<i>Although I'm not as delicate, pretty, and adorable as a flower,</i>

437
00:30:39,619 --> 00:30:41,840
<i>I'm more durable.</i>

438
00:30:45,680 --> 00:30:50,280
<i>If you're a leaf, I guess I can't see the flowers.</i>

439
00:30:55,971 --> 00:31:01,914
<i>[From Ye Shilan]</i>

440
00:31:12,119 --> 00:31:14,759
I didn't expect this to be our private meeting place.

441
00:31:14,760 --> 00:31:16,799
How can this be called a private meeting?

442
00:31:16,800 --> 00:31:20,100
Well, it's because we have to keep our romance secret.

443
00:31:20,100 --> 00:31:23,256
Other couples don't work in the same company.

444
00:31:23,256 --> 00:31:26,059
They can't see each other at noon. We should be grateful.

445
00:31:26,059 --> 00:31:30,000
I'm content. And I feel it's exciting.

446
00:31:33,050 --> 00:31:37,971
Look. We spend a lot of time together, will we get bored of each other?

447
00:31:37,971 --> 00:31:41,199
It's only been a few days. You are already worrying about it?

448
00:31:41,199 --> 00:31:43,828
Be prepared for danger.

449
00:31:43,828 --> 00:31:45,900
So, do you have a solution?

450
00:31:45,900 --> 00:31:47,300
Yeah.

451
00:31:47,880 --> 00:31:52,484
For example, give each other a little surprise from time to time.

452
00:31:53,079 --> 00:31:55,600
Okay, noted.

453
00:31:55,600 --> 00:31:58,689
I'm reminding myself. I'm not talking about you.

454
00:31:58,689 --> 00:32:01,719
You obviously don't have any confidence in me, okay?

455
00:32:01,719 --> 00:32:03,813
Confidence doesn't come from nothing.

456
00:32:03,813 --> 00:32:08,627
It's built on dedication and improving ourselves.

457
00:32:08,628 --> 00:32:12,679
I can't ignore you and indulge myself because you like me.

458
00:32:12,680 --> 00:32:16,180
Or love would be easily expendable.

459
00:32:16,180 --> 00:32:18,838
You're so serious and reasonable in a relationship.

460
00:32:18,839 --> 00:32:20,839
You're my girlfriend.

461
00:32:20,839 --> 00:32:23,450
- You're not serious?
- I'm serious, of course.

462
00:32:24,460 --> 00:32:26,210
Then, do you have confidence in me?

463
00:32:26,210 --> 00:32:27,800
I don't care about that.

464
00:32:27,800 --> 00:32:30,780
I just remember I was stamped by you.

465
00:32:30,780 --> 00:32:32,771
So, I'll never leave you.

466
00:32:34,119 --> 00:32:36,919
Tell me the truth. You're so good at relationships.

467
00:32:36,919 --> 00:32:39,919
Did you learn it from your best girlfriend's novels?

468
00:32:39,920 --> 00:32:42,057
I seldom read them.

469
00:32:42,900 --> 00:32:47,770
However, she'll tell me about something when she writes something exciting.

470
00:32:48,500 --> 00:32:50,409
It seems I have to work hard.

471
00:32:50,409 --> 00:32:52,039
I don't want to compete with that.

472
00:32:52,040 --> 00:32:55,471
Who said that? I can't lose.

473
00:32:56,371 --> 00:32:59,842
You've never lost when you quarreled with me.

474
00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:03,271
Do you want to win a war of words?

475
00:33:08,971 --> 00:33:10,930
It's almost time for work.

476
00:33:10,930 --> 00:33:12,159
Go to work.

477
00:33:12,159 --> 00:33:15,060
While there's no one around, don't you want to win once?

478
00:33:15,060 --> 00:33:17,619
It's up to you.

479
00:33:20,160 --> 00:33:22,100
I'm ready.

480
00:33:32,379 --> 00:33:34,980
Okay. I'm going to work.

481
00:33:41,900 --> 00:33:44,100
Did I win?

482
00:33:45,380 --> 00:33:47,920
Why do I feel I got played?

483
00:33:56,900 --> 00:33:59,228
The president will drive himself there. He can take three men.

484
00:33:59,228 --> 00:34:01,640
- Do you want to go with us?
- Who else?

485
00:34:01,640 --> 00:34:04,813
Qiao Yu. She's going to learn about free clinics.

486
00:34:04,813 --> 00:34:07,719
All right. Anyway, I know Vice Director Qiao.

487
00:34:07,719 --> 00:34:09,298
Where will we meet then?

488
00:34:09,298 --> 00:34:12,179
The same. In front of the hospital at 7:30 a.m.

489
00:34:12,179 --> 00:34:13,250
Okay.

490
00:34:13,250 --> 00:34:16,298
Dr. Ye, why do you have time to come down?

491
00:34:16,298 --> 00:34:18,419
My printer is broken. I'm here to use yours.

492
00:34:18,419 --> 00:34:20,771
When will you come back to pediatrics?

493
00:34:20,771 --> 00:34:24,085
It should be soon, I guess.

494
00:34:24,085 --> 00:34:26,899
I just went to the inpatient center. Colleagues there said they wanted to thank you.

495
00:34:26,899 --> 00:34:28,039
For what?

496
00:34:28,040 --> 00:34:30,957
Didn't you get them a massage lounge?

497
00:34:31,970 --> 00:34:34,085
They do work very hard.

498
00:34:34,085 --> 00:34:37,169
They change their day off and rotate. They always work midnight shifts.

499
00:34:37,169 --> 00:34:40,099
The president wanted to improve their working environment.

500
00:34:40,099 --> 00:34:42,084
I just made a tiny suggestion.

501
00:34:42,084 --> 00:34:44,228
The president listened to you.

502
00:34:44,228 --> 00:34:45,540
No.

503
00:34:45,540 --> 00:34:46,869
Come on.

504
00:34:46,870 --> 00:34:51,071
- That means Dr. Ye came up with a good idea.
- Yeah.

505
00:34:51,071 --> 00:34:52,719
I'm sorry. I said the wrong thing.

506
00:34:52,719 --> 00:34:54,399
It's okay.

507
00:34:57,560 --> 00:34:59,739
- Here.
- Thank you.

508
00:35:06,199 --> 00:35:07,739
Here.

509
00:35:07,739 --> 00:35:10,279
I just mentioned it in passing in the meeting.

510
00:35:10,280 --> 00:35:11,819
Many of the proposals were yours.

511
00:35:11,820 --> 00:35:14,471
I thought they were good. So, I adopted them.

512
00:35:15,040 --> 00:35:18,071
Now they're easy to go in the other direction.

513
00:35:18,071 --> 00:35:21,978
And we're in love. I felt guilty.

514
00:35:21,978 --> 00:35:23,729
A straight foot is not afraid of a crooked shoe.

515
00:35:23,729 --> 00:35:26,028
Don't care too much about what others think.

516
00:35:26,028 --> 00:35:28,385
I'm afraid it's bad for you.

517
00:35:29,040 --> 00:35:31,359
I met President Gao today.

518
00:35:31,360 --> 00:35:33,639
He also mentioned it.

519
00:35:34,639 --> 00:35:36,639
He talked to you?

520
00:35:37,342 --> 00:35:41,070
And he asked if it was my idea of supporting Taoyuan Village.

521
00:35:41,070 --> 00:35:43,685
I said it was your own decision.

522
00:35:48,760 --> 00:35:50,739
Any problems?

523
00:35:51,390 --> 00:35:52,857
Nothing.

524
00:35:52,857 --> 00:35:57,420
If he asks you something again, keep silent and tell me.

525
00:35:58,190 --> 00:35:59,857
Okay.

526
00:36:10,420 --> 00:36:12,770
He recommended many assistant candidates to me

527
00:36:12,770 --> 00:36:15,857
before I transferred you to be my assistant.

528
00:36:15,857 --> 00:36:19,514
He probably wanted to know as much stuff about me as possible.

529
00:36:19,514 --> 00:36:23,360
I chose you because I trusted you.

530
00:36:23,360 --> 00:36:26,040
Why did President Gao do that?

531
00:36:26,040 --> 00:36:28,438
This is his way of surviving in the workplace.

532
00:36:28,439 --> 00:36:30,840
Now it may be his habit.

533
00:36:30,840 --> 00:36:35,400
Although he looks kind, he's very complicated.

534
00:36:35,400 --> 00:36:38,828
Sometimes I can't understand the meaning of his words.

535
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:42,060
I got it.

536
00:36:42,060 --> 00:36:44,619
Anyway, I won't talk much before him.

537
00:36:44,619 --> 00:36:46,585
I won't cause you any trouble.

538
00:36:46,585 --> 00:36:49,499
Don't worry so much. I'm sure I can handle him.

539
00:36:49,499 --> 00:36:51,149
Here. Eat more.

540
00:36:51,150 --> 00:36:53,700
Let's go buy a gift for the director after this.

541
00:36:53,700 --> 00:36:55,140
Okay.

542
00:37:07,390 --> 00:37:09,490
Roads in Taoyuan Village are slippery when it rains.

543
00:37:09,490 --> 00:37:11,660
This sole is a non-slip.

544
00:37:11,660 --> 00:37:13,814
I think it's suitable for them.

545
00:37:13,814 --> 00:37:15,479
It's up to you.

546
00:37:15,479 --> 00:37:18,900
I'm buying them presents. You don't reach for the check.

547
00:37:18,900 --> 00:37:21,857
All right. I'll think of something else.

548
00:37:22,470 --> 00:37:24,978
- Get me a new pair.
- Okay.

00:38:40,228 --> 00:38:42,389
The director is a native of Taoyuan Village.

566
00:38:42,390 --> 00:38:43,999
Her father is a Chinese medicine doctor.

567
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:45,999
But her two brothers didn't want to learn it.

568
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:48,759
Only she was interested, so she stuck with it.

569
00:38:48,760 --> 00:38:51,499
I saw her technique was quite practiced.

570
00:38:51,499 --> 00:38:54,959
Yeah. Her children all work in big cities.

571
00:38:54,959 --> 00:38:57,478
They wanted to take her there, but she didn't want to go.

572
00:38:57,479 --> 00:39:00,299
So she stayed in the village to treat the villagers.

573
00:39:00,299 --> 00:39:02,520
Her life is very interesting.

574
00:39:03,080 --> 00:39:06,059
So, did the deputy director learn from her?

575
00:39:07,040 --> 00:39:09,540
The deputy director is a western medicine doctor.

576
00:39:09,540 --> 00:39:12,080
He used to work in a big hospital.

577
00:39:12,080 --> 00:39:15,880
I don't know why he came to Taoyuan Village.

578
00:39:15,880 --> 00:39:18,238
However, he's interested in Chinese medicine.

579
00:39:18,239 --> 00:39:20,360
So the director taught him.

580
00:39:20,360 --> 00:39:22,359
I think they both get along well.

581
00:39:22,359 --> 00:39:24,713
Yeah. One plays chess and the other Tai Ji.

582
00:39:24,713 --> 00:39:26,819
They're living a nice life.

583
00:39:27,639 --> 00:39:30,019
Come on, let's go over there.

584
00:40:09,879 --> 00:40:11,060
Hello?

585
00:40:11,060 --> 00:40:14,879
<i>You're right. They're in love.</i>

586
00:40:15,439 --> 00:40:18,859
My intuition is always correct.

587
00:40:18,859 --> 00:40:22,559
Is this girl the one that you asked me to investigate two months ago?

588
00:40:22,560 --> 00:40:24,519
Her father committed suicide?

589
00:40:24,519 --> 00:40:26,160
Yes, that's her.

590
00:40:26,160 --> 00:40:27,841
I wanted to bring her in,

591
00:40:27,841 --> 00:40:29,399
but then she became useless.

592
00:40:29,399 --> 00:40:32,289
It's just finding something of value from public information.

593
00:40:32,289 --> 00:40:34,578
I hope you got your money's worth.

594
00:40:34,578 --> 00:40:37,339
It's always good to have more information.

595
00:40:37,339 --> 00:40:39,800
Dig more.

596
00:40:39,800 --> 00:40:41,400
