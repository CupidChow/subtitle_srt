<i>[Episode 16]</i>

16
00:01:44,199 --> 00:01:47,659
- Yezi, I know now.
- You know what?

17
00:01:47,700 --> 00:01:50,419
All the things that Lu Zhaoxi did doesn't show a total disregard for your feelings.

18
00:01:50,419 --> 00:01:52,399
He did those on purpose just to provoke you.

19
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:55,680
- It's like what I wrote in my novel.
- Why did he want to provoke me?

20
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:57,859
Are you a fool? He likes you.

21
00:01:57,859 --> 00:02:00,020
He wants to know if you like him back.

22
00:02:00,020 --> 00:02:02,499
No. He definitely knows you like him.

23
00:02:02,499 --> 00:02:04,139
He just wants you to take the initiative.

24
00:02:04,139 --> 00:02:05,819
That's not possible.

25
00:02:05,819 --> 00:02:08,759
You don't actually think that crappy explanation could fool him.

26
00:02:08,759 --> 00:02:11,039
He's a fox.

27
00:02:12,439 --> 00:02:15,260
I think you're thinking too much.

28
00:02:15,260 --> 00:02:18,240
He even let you buy the dress you liked.

29
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:20,539
Clearly, the dress was for you to wear.

30
00:02:20,539 --> 00:02:24,438
I'm pretty sure that he lied about getting his ex-girlfriend back.

31
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:27,638
He's not that childish, is he?

32
00:02:27,639 --> 00:02:30,399
Didn't you say that when he isn't working, he's always this childish?

33
00:02:30,399 --> 00:02:34,260
Tomorrow, he'll definitely say that something came up with his ex-girlfriend and he'll let you go over and help.

34
00:02:34,260 --> 00:02:37,260
- You can relax.
- Why?

35
00:02:37,260 --> 00:02:38,780
I'm not expecting anything.

36
00:02:38,780 --> 00:02:41,959
Oh, please. I know you too well.

37
00:02:44,839 --> 00:02:49,560
If he asks me to go and help, what should I do?

38
00:02:50,839 --> 00:02:52,500
Pretend that you don't know.

39
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:55,360
Put on some airs and play Tai Chi (go to the extreme).

40
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:57,179
Let's see how he'll act.

♫ <i>The wind blew at that moment</i> ♫

44
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:30,060
♫ <i>Leaving too many unknown colors</i> ♫

45
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:38,199
♫ <i>Step-by-step, sinking into the vast forest of thoughts</i> ♫

46
00:03:38,199 --> 00:03:43,000
♫ <i>We meet while chasing</i> ♫

♫ <i>The stars in the dark night sky</i> ♫

48
00:03:48,140 --> 00:03:49,599
This dress looks really good on you.

49
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:51,279
It suits you quite well.

50
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:55,559
Does it look better on me or on Qiao Yu?

51
00:03:55,559 --> 00:03:58,179
Qiao Yu hasn't worn this dress.

52
00:03:58,179 --> 00:03:59,899
You ask me to deliver it in such a hurry,

53
00:03:59,899 --> 00:04:01,999
and you didn't even let her try it on?

54
00:04:01,999 --> 00:04:03,919
Swimming makes you extremely tired.

55
00:04:05,279 --> 00:04:07,960
Qiao Yu said both of you are into sports,

56
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:10,379
and are quite energetic.

57
00:04:10,379 --> 00:04:12,579
I thought you'd never get tired.

58
00:04:15,119 --> 00:04:16,720
Are you jealous?

59
00:04:18,039 --> 00:04:20,060
I'm just a stand-in for Qiao Yu.

60
00:04:20,060 --> 00:04:21,979
Who am I to get jealous?

61
00:04:21,979 --> 00:04:24,159
I can smell jealousy.

62
00:04:25,359 --> 00:04:27,680
I'm just getting in the mood in advance

63
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:32,199
and find the feeling of being pursued and liked by you.

64
00:04:32,199 --> 00:04:35,540
Yes. You should get in the mood.

65
00:04:35,540 --> 00:04:37,940
You're my Miss Right now.

66
00:04:37,940 --> 00:04:39,340
That's right.

67
00:04:39,340 --> 00:04:42,139
Your exclusive Miss Right for half a day.

68
00:04:44,959 --> 00:04:47,578
Shouldn't you remind me of anything I should pay attention to

69
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:49,719
when having dinner with your parents?

70
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:51,280
You know my mother pretty well.

71
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:53,259
Just be yourself.

72
00:04:53,259 --> 00:04:56,139
She thought I'd like you one day.

73
00:04:56,139 --> 00:04:58,260
Really? Yeah.

74
00:04:58,260 --> 00:05:01,340
Haven't you found out that she was selling me out to you?

75
00:05:03,220 --> 00:05:04,720
Kind of.

76
00:05:05,519 --> 00:05:07,199
On the surface, it seemed

77
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:09,220
that she was complaining about you with me,

78
00:05:09,220 --> 00:05:12,339
but actually, she was complimenting you.

79
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:19,330
However, she should be more closely connected with Qiao Yu.

80
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,639
You're even jealous of my mom?

81
00:05:26,079 --> 00:05:28,179
It was just a casual remark.

82
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:31,820
What about your dad?

83
00:05:31,820 --> 00:05:34,199
Will he think it's weird for a superior and a subordinate

84
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:36,319
to get into a relationship?

85
00:05:36,319 --> 00:05:37,919
Maybe.

86
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:42,358
He probably thinks that I'm carrying a torch for you,

87
00:05:42,359 --> 00:05:44,060
so he won't say anything.

88
00:05:44,060 --> 00:05:46,259
Besides, my mom will be there.

89
00:05:46,259 --> 00:05:48,000
So don't worry.

90
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,720
I'm not worried.

91
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:52,759
Anyway, you'll have to clean up the mess.

92
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:02,620
These carnations just arrived this morning.

93
00:06:02,620 --> 00:06:04,820
The colors are great.

94
00:06:04,820 --> 00:06:07,439
I'll take 12 of them, and add some baby's breath.

95
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:08,480
Okay.

96
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:11,500
Only 12. Will it be enough?

97
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:13,440
How many do you want?

98
00:06:14,479 --> 00:06:16,479
12 it is then. I'll listen to my Miss Right.

99
00:06:16,479 --> 00:06:18,320
Okay.

100
00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:20,279
And six lilies, please.

101
00:06:20,279 --> 00:06:21,880
Plain packaging will do.

102
00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:23,398
I'm going to put them in a vase.

103
00:06:23,399 --> 00:06:24,820
Okay.

104
00:06:30,679 --> 00:06:32,340
Do you need anything else?

105
00:06:32,979 --> 00:06:35,299
How many colors of roses do you have?

106
00:06:35,299 --> 00:06:38,040
A lot. Which color do you like?

107
00:06:40,519 --> 00:06:42,079
Why are you looking at me?

108
00:06:42,079 --> 00:06:44,540
Buy whatever you want.

109
00:06:44,540 --> 00:06:46,259
I like them all.

110
00:06:47,220 --> 00:06:49,380
Then follow your heart.

111
00:06:50,479 --> 00:06:52,479
I'll take two for each color.

112
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:53,839
Okay.

113
00:06:54,579 --> 00:06:56,678
Are these flowers dyed?

114
00:06:56,679 --> 00:06:58,820
No, they're all natural.

115
00:06:58,820 --> 00:07:00,359
That's good.

116
00:07:09,359 --> 00:07:11,179
Right, right.

117
00:07:11,179 --> 00:07:14,259
You're prophetic, my big writer.

118
00:07:14,259 --> 00:07:17,839
<i>Of course. I didn't write so many novels for nothing.</i>

119
00:07:18,399 --> 00:07:21,558
By the way, did you tell Lu Zhaoxi my pen name

120
00:07:21,559 --> 00:07:23,259
and he read my novels?

121
00:07:23,259 --> 00:07:27,079
No, I didn't. You didn't want me to tell others, didn't you?

122
00:07:27,079 --> 00:07:30,539
I feel it was a bit too coincidental.

123
00:07:30,539 --> 00:07:33,419
Then, how about I ask him for you?

124
00:07:33,419 --> 00:07:38,240
Never mind. I'll wait until you're really together.

125
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:40,199
Who's going to be together with him?

126
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:42,359
Don't you like each other?

127
00:07:43,239 --> 00:07:46,859
Who said two people who like each other have to be together?

128
00:07:46,859 --> 00:07:51,340
Yezi, I just want you to put on some airs and play it cool.

129
00:07:51,340 --> 00:07:53,979
Don't do anything stupid.

130
00:07:55,160 --> 00:07:57,419
Don't worry. I know what I'm doing.

131
00:07:57,419 --> 00:07:58,759
How can I not worry?

132
00:07:58,760 --> 00:08:01,080
I don't think you know what you're doing.

133
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:03,879
All right. I have to hang up.

134
00:08:03,880 --> 00:08:05,259
We'll talk about it tonight.

135
00:08:05,259 --> 00:08:06,780
I...

136
00:08:09,399 --> 00:08:12,179
You didn't buy the colorful bouquet?

137
00:08:12,179 --> 00:08:15,679
I tried it and it looked so weird.

138
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:19,258
Here you go. I prepared it especially for you.

139
00:08:20,079 --> 00:08:21,800
You prepared it for me?

140
00:08:23,679 --> 00:08:25,139
Today's my mom's birthday,

141
00:08:25,139 --> 00:08:27,500
and carnations do seem to fit her.

142
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:31,518
But since we're here to buy flowers, my mom will scold me

143
00:08:31,519 --> 00:08:33,479
if I don't buy roses for my Miss Right.

144
00:08:33,479 --> 00:08:34,819
That makes sense.

145
00:08:34,819 --> 00:08:38,660
Buying me roses will make it look more real.

146
00:08:38,660 --> 00:08:40,158
You're so considerate.

147
00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:43,619
Of course. I've always been serious.

148
00:08:43,619 --> 00:08:46,119
- Let's go.
- Go.

149
00:08:52,559 --> 00:08:54,118
Are we going to eat at home?

150
00:08:54,119 --> 00:08:56,398
Yes. We'll cook, is that okay?

151
00:08:56,398 --> 00:08:57,900
Sure.

152
00:08:58,919 --> 00:09:01,139
Is there anything else we need to buy?

153
00:09:01,139 --> 00:09:03,519
No, I've prepared everything.

154
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:09,320
Here.

155
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:14,119
Hold on. I'll do it myself.

156
00:09:15,919 --> 00:09:18,140
- Give me this.
- Thank you.

157
00:09:37,139 --> 00:09:38,780
Let me help you.

158
00:09:38,780 --> 00:09:41,498
No need. Go make some tea.

159
00:09:41,498 --> 00:09:43,000
All right.

160
00:10:05,540 --> 00:10:09,019
Have you always lived loving life?

161
00:10:09,019 --> 00:10:11,220
What is loving life?

162
00:10:11,220 --> 00:10:16,059
Well, some people only want things to be practical.

163
00:10:16,059 --> 00:10:20,558
They think that the sense of form, beauty, and atmosphere

164
00:10:20,559 --> 00:10:23,141
that have a soothing effect on mind are all unimportant.

165
00:10:23,141 --> 00:10:26,259
But some people are willing to spend time and effort on them,

166
00:10:26,259 --> 00:10:28,980
and live their lives with elegance.

167
00:10:28,980 --> 00:10:31,580
- Am I like this?
- You are.

168
00:10:31,580 --> 00:10:35,398
I remember you decorated the room in Taoyuan Village with some wild flowers

169
00:10:35,398 --> 00:10:39,420
and hand-made ornaments, making it very nice and warm.

170
00:10:39,420 --> 00:10:43,819
And you suggested to put some flowers in my office.

171
00:10:43,819 --> 00:10:47,619
Even now, you're still carefully setting the table, arranging the flowers in the vase,

172
00:10:47,619 --> 00:10:49,920
and preparing a proper afternoon tea.

173
00:10:50,980 --> 00:10:53,978
I'm actually very pragmatic. You didn't find that out?

174
00:10:53,978 --> 00:10:56,419
None of these costs me money,

175
00:10:56,419 --> 00:11:00,859
or I could say they only cost very little money.

176
00:11:01,619 --> 00:11:04,240
But your time and effort are also costly.

177
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:05,818
Even if the conditions are limited,

178
00:11:05,818 --> 00:11:10,499
you can still make your life more cozy and beautiful under limited conditions.

179
00:11:11,540 --> 00:11:13,699
I hadn't thought of it that way.

180
00:11:13,699 --> 00:11:17,219
Now that you have mentioned it, it kind of makes sense.

181
00:11:18,119 --> 00:11:22,419
In fact, I believe people are like flowers.

182
00:11:22,419 --> 00:11:28,079
Some flowers grow well in a good environment,

183
00:11:28,079 --> 00:11:32,099
having plenty of light, regular water, and enough care.

184
00:11:32,099 --> 00:11:35,319
But some flowers grow in gravel,

185
00:11:35,319 --> 00:11:38,739
without sunlight and enough water,

186
00:11:38,739 --> 00:11:42,179
they still try hard to put down roots, thrive in gravel,

187
00:11:42,179 --> 00:11:44,159
and be exposed to the sun.

188
00:11:44,159 --> 00:11:46,599
What kind of flower are you?

189
00:11:47,579 --> 00:11:51,560
I am not a flower. I'm like a leaf.

190
00:11:51,560 --> 00:11:54,580
Though it's not that delicate, pretty, and attractive,

191
00:11:54,580 --> 00:11:56,880
it's more resilient.

192
00:12:02,980 --> 00:12:07,539
If you're a leaf, I guess I probably can't see any flowers.

193
00:12:11,459 --> 00:12:13,459
You really see me as your Miss Right now?

194
00:12:13,459 --> 00:12:15,980
The honey words just came out of your mouth.

195
00:12:16,699 --> 00:12:18,599
Do you like it?

196
00:12:19,479 --> 00:12:21,220
I do.

197
00:12:21,220 --> 00:12:25,019
When your parents come, I'll surely do my best.

198
00:12:31,619 --> 00:12:33,919
Here they are. I'm going to pick them up.

199
00:12:33,919 --> 00:12:35,839
Do you want me to go with you?

200
00:12:35,839 --> 00:12:39,040
No, thanks. Just enjoy your life.

201
00:12:46,359 --> 00:12:50,939
Ye Shilan, I wasn't joking today.

202
00:13:21,220 --> 00:13:23,080
Done.

203
00:13:24,100 --> 00:13:26,580
Looks so pretty. It goes well with your outfit.

204
00:13:26,580 --> 00:13:28,598
Thank you. What do you think?

205
00:13:28,598 --> 00:13:31,280
Good. Our son has a good eye.

206
00:13:31,280 --> 00:13:34,099
Zhaoxi always has a good eye.

207
00:13:34,099 --> 00:13:37,018
Mom, Ye Shilan and I picked it out together.

208
00:13:37,018 --> 00:13:40,020
We both had our eye on it.

209
00:13:40,020 --> 00:13:42,199
You also have a good eye.

210
00:13:42,199 --> 00:13:45,958
Auntie, I have another gift for you. Please wait.

211
00:13:45,958 --> 00:13:47,779
Okay.

212
00:13:47,779 --> 00:13:49,719
Why didn't I know that?

213
00:13:49,719 --> 00:13:54,340
President, I don't think I should report this to you.

214
00:13:54,340 --> 00:13:56,400
You really don't have to.

215
00:13:57,300 --> 00:14:00,699
Auntie, this is the essential oil I made.

216
00:14:00,699 --> 00:14:03,000
You know how to make essential oils?

217
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:06,100
I just learned it for fun. It's simple.

218
00:14:08,459 --> 00:14:10,519
Very elegant. Smell it.

219
00:14:10,519 --> 00:14:16,918
It feels like a gentle breeze from lavender fields fanned my cheek.

220
00:14:16,918 --> 00:14:19,558
You can use it at bedtime. It can help you get better sleep.

221
00:14:19,558 --> 00:14:23,059
I need it so much. I really like it. Thank you, Ye.

222
00:14:23,059 --> 00:14:25,419
I'm glad you like it, Auntie. Happy birthday.

223
00:14:25,419 --> 00:14:27,080
Thank you.

224
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:32,660
Look. Only girls know how to give a thoughtful gift.

225
00:14:32,660 --> 00:14:36,640
Not like the two of them, they only buy me gifts in a mall.

226
00:14:36,640 --> 00:14:39,359
Mom, you can just compliment her.

227
00:14:39,359 --> 00:14:41,020
But don't depreciate our efforts.

228
00:14:41,020 --> 00:14:43,358
This is called adequate stimulus.

229
00:14:43,358 --> 00:14:47,200
Understanding your gaps can help you improve.

230
00:14:48,180 --> 00:14:49,939
I'm starving.

231
00:14:49,939 --> 00:14:51,519
Two more dishes and dinner will be ready.

232
00:14:51,519 --> 00:14:53,739
Ye Shilan, it's your turn.

233
00:14:53,739 --> 00:14:55,760
Then I'm going to cook.

234
00:15:11,039 --> 00:15:13,759
Come on. Let's toast with tea.

235
00:15:13,759 --> 00:15:14,999
Okay. Happy birthday.

236
00:15:14,999 --> 00:15:16,159
All right. Happy birthday.

237
00:15:16,159 --> 00:15:18,620
- Thanks.
- Thank you.

238
00:15:21,379 --> 00:15:23,079
- Dig in.
- Okay.

239
00:15:23,079 --> 00:15:24,760
Are you happy?

240
00:15:24,760 --> 00:15:26,980
Here, eat some more.

241
00:15:26,980 --> 00:15:28,498
This is your favorite.

242
00:15:28,498 --> 00:15:31,119
Okay, you eat some more too.

243
00:15:35,819 --> 00:15:41,440
I heard you had a little misunderstanding back in Taoyuan Village.

244
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:45,260
Yes. At that time, I didn't know the president was changed,

245
00:15:45,260 --> 00:15:47,500
so I thought he was a liar.

246
00:15:47,500 --> 00:15:51,638
When he got back, Zhaoxi told me about this and praised you.

247
00:15:51,638 --> 00:15:54,120
Mom, don't exaggerate it.

248
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:55,480
What did he say about me?

249
00:15:55,480 --> 00:15:57,619
He said you have a good sense of justice.

250
00:15:57,619 --> 00:15:59,519
But hot-headed.

251
00:15:59,519 --> 00:16:02,559
He said you were kind and virtuous.

252
00:16:02,559 --> 00:16:04,359
But a little aggressive.

253
00:16:04,359 --> 00:16:07,579
He said you were very pretty.

254
00:16:09,180 --> 00:16:10,980
That's true.

255
00:16:10,980 --> 00:16:14,638
You praised me, and deliberately scared me when I came back.

256
00:16:14,638 --> 00:16:16,780
That's because you felt guilty.

257
00:16:16,780 --> 00:16:21,000
Well, that shows you were meant to become friends.

258
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:24,679
You're right. If I didn't become his temporary assistant,

259
00:16:24,679 --> 00:16:27,160
we could barely know each other.

260
00:16:27,820 --> 00:16:31,180
Since it was fate, there might have been other ways for us to meet.

261
00:16:31,180 --> 00:16:33,000
I guess you can't escape.

262
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:37,999
Ye, do you think he makes a good president?

263
00:16:38,599 --> 00:16:40,440
Yes, he does.

264
00:16:41,059 --> 00:16:43,880
Is there anything that he needs to improve on?

265
00:16:46,300 --> 00:16:49,860
Dad, she can't speak ill of me to my face.

266
00:16:49,860 --> 00:16:53,939
Aren't you friends? She should be honest.

267
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:59,779
Yes. But I can't think of anything right now.

268
00:16:59,779 --> 00:17:03,340
It's fine, it's fine. I was just asking.

269
00:17:03,340 --> 00:17:08,139
In the future, if you find anything wrong with what he does, feel free to point it out.

270
00:17:08,139 --> 00:17:12,100
Don't be concerned and don't be scared of him.

271
00:17:12,100 --> 00:17:14,160
Look at her. Does she look like she's afraid of me?

272
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:15,899
That's good.

273
00:17:15,899 --> 00:17:20,198
I was worried that you forced Ye to celebrate your mom's birthday today.

274
00:17:20,198 --> 00:17:23,170
No, no. Auntie usually takes good care of me,

275
00:17:23,170 --> 00:17:26,410
so I came especially for her.

276
00:17:26,419 --> 00:17:28,639
Ye came especially for you?

277
00:17:28,639 --> 00:17:34,198
Today's my birthday and Ye came to celebrate it for me. Don't I deserve it?

278
00:17:34,198 --> 00:17:36,019
You do.

279
00:17:36,019 --> 00:17:39,960
I thought these two were...

280
00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:43,459
Let's not mind these young people's business.

281
00:17:43,459 --> 00:17:44,779
Do I care?

282
00:17:44,779 --> 00:17:47,159
You're the one who's always worrying.

283
00:17:47,159 --> 00:17:51,139
Zhaoxi is so excellent. Do I need to worry?

284
00:17:51,139 --> 00:17:52,799
But he's not getting any younger.

285
00:17:52,799 --> 00:17:55,838
Look. You're also worried.

Okay. Thanks.

301
00:19:26,979 --> 00:19:29,299
Did my parents make you feel uncomfortable?

302
00:19:29,299 --> 00:19:33,400
No. Your dad defied expectations.

303
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:37,180
It's different from the last time we met in the office.

304
00:19:37,180 --> 00:19:39,100
I feel the same.

305
00:19:39,100 --> 00:19:43,079
Probably because the older he gets, the younger he feels inside.

306
00:19:44,940 --> 00:19:47,580
I wish my dad were still here.

307
00:19:53,099 --> 00:19:56,779
It's fine. I'm just feeling a bit of regret.

308
00:19:57,600 --> 00:20:00,380
How did I do? Was I okay?

309
00:20:01,859 --> 00:20:03,460
Very good.

310
00:20:03,460 --> 00:20:05,479
When did you prepare the essential oil?

311
00:20:05,479 --> 00:20:07,539
After we bought the present together.

312
00:20:07,539 --> 00:20:09,218
So you knew you were coming?

313
00:20:09,218 --> 00:20:11,219
Of course not.

314
00:20:11,219 --> 00:20:15,199
I just thought I could give it to her next time we meet.

315
00:20:20,060 --> 00:20:23,300
Did they say anything?

316
00:20:24,219 --> 00:20:26,299
My mom has always liked you.

317
00:20:26,299 --> 00:20:31,638
My dad said you had good manners and he's happy with our relationship now.

318
00:20:32,560 --> 00:20:34,899
Then I've paid off my debts.

319
00:20:34,899 --> 00:20:38,219
And I left you with a puzzle.

320
00:20:40,060 --> 00:20:42,839
Sounds like you're getting back at me.

321
00:20:45,660 --> 00:20:47,819
Do you want to send me home?

322
00:20:48,979 --> 00:20:50,680
Of course.

323
00:20:50,680 --> 00:20:52,379
Let's go.

324
00:21:10,639 --> 00:21:13,319
Aren't you going to say something?

325
00:21:14,379 --> 00:21:16,139
What should I say?

326
00:21:17,259 --> 00:21:19,439
About what I mentioned.

327
00:21:19,439 --> 00:21:21,719
I wasn't joking today.

328
00:21:23,720 --> 00:21:26,760
What do you mean by that?

329
00:21:30,099 --> 00:21:32,380
I mean...

330
00:21:33,580 --> 00:21:35,419
I admit defeat.

331
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:39,280
I like you.

332
00:21:40,279 --> 00:21:42,560
I'm pursuing you.

333
00:21:45,780 --> 00:21:49,400
- Oh.
- Oh?

334
00:21:51,460 --> 00:21:53,350
Sure enough, you already knew.

335
00:21:53,350 --> 00:21:55,920
No wonder you acted so calmly.

336
00:21:58,959 --> 00:22:00,320
You're not pursuing Qiao Yu?

337
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:04,279
I was referring to you, but you had to bring Qiao Yu up. All right?

338
00:22:04,279 --> 00:22:06,379
Then, did I ask you to swim together?

339
00:22:06,379 --> 00:22:08,020
I...

340
00:22:08,639 --> 00:22:11,959
So I'm childish, okay? You happy now?

341
00:22:11,959 --> 00:22:14,000
I apologize to you.

342
00:22:15,019 --> 00:22:19,219
No need. I didn't say I wanted to be your girlfriend.

343
00:22:20,739 --> 00:22:24,420
Of course. It's hard to pursue my Miss Right.

344
00:22:24,420 --> 00:22:26,660
But I'll keep trying.

345
00:22:27,540 --> 00:22:33,200
Actually, there's also something I want to say to you.

346
00:22:34,799 --> 00:22:36,659
Wait a minute.

347
00:22:36,659 --> 00:22:38,459
Let me find a place to park.

348
00:22:38,459 --> 00:22:42,459
I'm afraid I'll get emotional and it won't be safe.

349
00:22:42,459 --> 00:22:44,740
It's not that dramatic.

350
00:22:44,740 --> 00:22:47,640
I think it's necessary seeing how serious you are.

351
00:23:07,219 --> 00:23:10,999
Say what you want to say. No pressure.

352
00:23:10,999 --> 00:23:14,439
I want want to find a quiet and relaxing place.

353
00:23:18,840 --> 00:23:20,760
Lu Zhaoxi.

354
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:24,640
Thank you for liking me.

355
00:23:26,499 --> 00:23:28,439
I like you, too.

356
00:23:33,379 --> 00:23:35,740
You already knew that, right?

357
00:23:38,180 --> 00:23:40,100
I'm not stupid.

358
00:23:42,079 --> 00:23:47,260
In fact, when I realized I liked you,

359
00:23:48,780 --> 00:23:51,180
I was quite worried.

360
00:23:51,180 --> 00:23:52,920
Why?

361
00:23:54,019 --> 00:23:56,680
Because I didn't think you'd like me back,

362
00:23:58,039 --> 00:24:00,479
and I was afraid that you'd like me.

363
00:24:00,479 --> 00:24:02,319
Afraid?

364
00:24:03,979 --> 00:24:07,839
My friend joked that you're my savior.

365
00:24:08,940 --> 00:24:11,679
You transferred me here from Taoyuan Village,

366
00:24:11,679 --> 00:24:15,299
gave me a hand when I was about to give in to Chief Huang,

367
00:24:16,300 --> 00:24:19,519
and pretended to be my boyfriend to reassure my mom.

368
00:24:19,519 --> 00:24:22,939
You know a lot about my past,

369
00:24:22,939 --> 00:24:29,400
so I always feel embarrassed, pitiful, and small...

370
00:24:30,100 --> 00:24:32,359
in front of you.

371
00:24:33,940 --> 00:24:38,420
You were afraid I'd like you because I pity you?

372
00:24:39,180 --> 00:24:40,820
Kind of.

373
00:24:42,300 --> 00:24:47,959
Don't you take pity on those street cats and dogs?

374
00:24:48,800 --> 00:24:51,279
So are you a cat or a dog?

375
00:24:51,279 --> 00:24:52,459
I'm serious.

376
00:24:52,459 --> 00:24:54,660
I'm also serious.

377
00:24:56,259 --> 00:25:01,019
Ye Shilan, I'm not your savior.

378
00:25:01,019 --> 00:25:03,800
Your savior has always been yourself.

379
00:25:04,460 --> 00:25:07,740
Even though you had a family breakdown during your childhood,

380
00:25:07,740 --> 00:25:11,000
even though your growing conditions weren't very good,

381
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:13,879
and even though troubles arose in your work,

382
00:25:13,879 --> 00:25:16,140
you're still passionate about life,

383
00:25:16,140 --> 00:25:18,019
have good wishes,

384
00:25:18,019 --> 00:25:20,439
and provide conditions for yourself with your own hands

385
00:25:20,439 --> 00:25:22,780
to earn a better life.

386
00:25:23,580 --> 00:25:25,859
Sympathy is an instinct of normal people.

387
00:25:25,859 --> 00:25:28,040
I admit that I sympathize with you,

388
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:30,880
but I admire you more.

389
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:35,000
I may sympathize with many people,

390
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:37,239
but there's only one person I like...

391
00:25:37,999 --> 00:25:39,959
and that's you.

392
00:25:50,700 --> 00:25:55,540
♫ <i>You are a part of my life</i> ♫

393
00:25:56,541 --> 00:25:58,860
I'm not done yet.

394
00:26:03,119 --> 00:26:05,119
Then go ahead.

395
00:26:08,639 --> 00:26:11,379
I remember you said

396
00:26:11,379 --> 00:26:14,320
feelings are incomprehensible

397
00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:16,699
and unpredictable.

398
00:26:18,140 --> 00:26:22,039
So, are you sure you like me?

399
00:26:22,039 --> 00:26:25,140
Aren't your feelings for me temporary?

400
00:26:25,140 --> 00:26:28,879
Or... you might have gotten it wrong?

401
00:26:28,879 --> 00:26:31,479
Why do you think I got it wrong?

402
00:26:32,580 --> 00:26:35,959
Well, for this whole thing,

403
00:26:36,820 --> 00:26:39,179
I'm also responsible.

404
00:26:40,619 --> 00:26:43,299
While we were pretending to be a couple,

405
00:26:43,299 --> 00:26:45,979
I felt quite happy.

406
00:26:45,979 --> 00:26:48,720
I enjoyed the intimacy,

407
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:53,359
and I even became a little obsessed with it.

408
00:26:56,780 --> 00:27:00,020
It's a shame to say it out loud.

409
00:27:00,020 --> 00:27:01,760
No.

410
00:27:02,259 --> 00:27:04,020
I feel the same.

411
00:27:07,480 --> 00:27:11,700
Did I do or say anything overly intimate?

412
00:27:11,700 --> 00:27:13,679
Yes.

413
00:27:13,679 --> 00:27:16,660
And that made my heart flutter.

414
00:27:16,660 --> 00:27:19,699
When I thought you only took me as a friend,

415
00:27:19,699 --> 00:27:22,560
I even suspected that you were a love expert.

416
00:27:22,560 --> 00:27:25,860
I already fell for you at that time.

417
00:27:27,119 --> 00:27:31,180
I just hadn't realized it.

418
00:27:37,300 --> 00:27:42,319
I had a different feeling about you much earlier than that.

419
00:27:43,099 --> 00:27:46,540
But I only counted it as a momentary crush.

420
00:27:47,399 --> 00:27:53,620
I knew what I wanted was constant and spontaneous feelings.

421
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:57,019
With these kinds of feelings,

422
00:27:57,019 --> 00:27:59,700
I couldn't help but listen to your voice.

423
00:27:59,700 --> 00:28:01,420
I began to act weird.

424
00:28:01,420 --> 00:28:03,839
<i>President, good night.</i>

425
00:28:04,700 --> 00:28:07,279
<i>President, good night.</i>

426
00:28:08,099 --> 00:28:13,079
With these kinds of feeling, I tried every means to see you,

427
00:28:13,079 --> 00:28:15,900
and just seeing you made me happy.

428
00:28:16,780 --> 00:28:18,539
<i>Get in the car.</i>

429
00:28:21,359 --> 00:28:23,460
With these kinds of feelings,

430
00:28:23,460 --> 00:28:25,859
I involuntarily sparked with you

431
00:28:25,859 --> 00:28:28,479
and was deeply attracted to you.

432
00:28:28,479 --> 00:28:31,160
It was like a spell was cast onto me.

433
00:28:36,859 --> 00:28:40,179
You gave me more than that.

434
00:28:40,780 --> 00:28:43,639
I like to talk with you, listen to you,

435
00:28:43,639 --> 00:28:45,719
and share my stories with you.

436
00:28:46,660 --> 00:28:51,680
My feelings for you are not a spur of the moment,

437
00:28:52,300 --> 00:28:54,039
I became more and more certain about it.

438
00:28:54,039 --> 00:28:56,239
And my heart led me here.

439
00:28:58,239 --> 00:29:01,220
You really like me that much?

440
00:29:01,220 --> 00:29:02,900
Yes.

441
00:29:03,780 --> 00:29:08,580
♫ <i>You are a part of my life</i> ♫

442
00:29:08,580 --> 00:29:11,540
♫ <i>You're my shining armor</i> ♫

443
00:29:11,540 --> 00:29:15,140
♫ <i>Now I'm pretty sure</i> ♫

444
00:29:16,820 --> 00:29:18,640
You're still not done?

445
00:29:27,060 --> 00:29:30,959
Actually, I've thought it through.

446
00:29:30,959 --> 00:29:33,619
I want to make it clear to you.

447
00:29:33,619 --> 00:29:37,739
I feel very blessed and happy

448
00:29:37,739 --> 00:29:39,900
to be liked by you.

449
00:29:41,019 --> 00:29:46,460
I also want to covet the happiness of being with you this day

450
00:29:46,460 --> 00:29:51,380
and then go back to our original positions.

451
00:29:52,360 --> 00:29:57,720
I'm well aware I've got a difficult personality,

452
00:29:57,720 --> 00:30:00,539
it's just I haven't shown this side of me to you.

453
00:30:00,539 --> 00:30:03,240
You probably won't like it.

454
00:30:03,240 --> 00:30:09,560
I'm also aware that since I was a kid, I've never been a lucky person.

455
00:30:10,959 --> 00:30:14,740
So, every time I become too immersed

456
00:30:14,740 --> 00:30:18,619
or too carried away, the alarm will set off

457
00:30:18,619 --> 00:30:23,419
and I'll ask myself if I can handle this happiness.

458
00:30:26,700 --> 00:30:28,880
I'm timid.

459
00:30:30,039 --> 00:30:32,280
I want to have it...

460
00:30:33,279 --> 00:30:37,099
and I'm also afraid of losing it.

461
00:30:38,019 --> 00:30:40,199
Do you get that?

462
00:30:43,719 --> 00:30:46,639
Though I can't really relate with you,

463
00:30:47,700 --> 00:30:49,699
I understand you.

464
00:30:57,379 --> 00:30:59,980
Do you know what this place is?

465
00:31:00,979 --> 00:31:02,580
What?

466
00:31:02,580 --> 00:31:05,040
The place where we saw the rainbow.

467
00:31:06,300 --> 00:31:08,079
Wait here for me.

468
00:31:16,479 --> 00:31:20,139
<i>Don't just stand there. Turn around and do some poses.</i>

469
00:31:27,739 --> 00:31:29,719
<i>It's cute.</i>

470
00:31:32,259 --> 00:31:34,039
<i>This one is good.</i>

471
00:31:34,039 --> 00:31:36,399
<i>Why were you so childish today?</i>

472
00:31:36,399 --> 00:31:38,260
<i>Because I saw a rainbow.</i>

473
00:31:38,260 --> 00:31:40,779
<i>Rainbow?</i>

474
00:31:40,779 --> 00:31:42,820
<i>I saw a rainbow this afternoon</i>

475
00:31:42,820 --> 00:31:44,999
<i>and a good thing happened this evening.</i>

476
00:31:44,999 --> 00:31:46,980
<i>That's why I'm in a good mood.</i>

477
00:31:55,680 --> 00:31:57,579
You really bought such a bouquet of flowers.

478
00:31:57,579 --> 00:31:59,580
Yeah.

479
00:31:59,580 --> 00:32:01,839
Why didn't I see it?

480
00:32:01,839 --> 00:32:04,360
I'm not telling you.

481
00:32:04,360 --> 00:32:07,619
You said good things would happen if we saw a rainbow.

482
00:32:07,619 --> 00:32:09,940
So I'm giving you a rainbow now.

483
00:32:09,940 --> 00:32:11,839
Rainbow.

484
00:32:12,859 --> 00:32:15,040
What an interesting name.

485
00:32:15,040 --> 00:32:16,839
Thank you.

486
00:32:17,859 --> 00:32:20,039
Don't feel too stressed.

487
00:32:20,039 --> 00:32:22,460
It's just a bouquet of flowers.

488
00:32:22,460 --> 00:32:24,830
There's no rush to turn me down.

489
00:32:25,359 --> 00:32:30,880
Though I can't promise only good things will happen to you in the future,

490
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:33,740
even if something bad happens,

491
00:32:33,740 --> 00:32:38,679
I'll try my best to make it go in a good direction.

492
00:32:43,580 --> 00:32:46,919
Let's go. I'll send you home.

493
00:32:49,019 --> 00:32:50,839
Lu Zhaoxi.

494
00:32:57,580 --> 00:33:00,539
Now I'm done.

495
00:33:04,660 --> 00:33:09,460
♫ <i>You are a part of my life</i> ♫

♫ <i>We will come to the end. Trust me</i> ♫

499
00:33:20,060 --> 00:33:22,040
I've decided.

500
00:33:22,900 --> 00:33:26,620
There's a lot of uncertainty in this world.

501
00:33:27,219 --> 00:33:31,559
But when good things come, I must seize them.

502
00:33:32,379 --> 00:33:37,039
This time, I want to get carried away.

503
00:33:40,060 --> 00:33:42,320
That's how you get carried away?

504
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:48,020
♫ <i>So I need you holding my heart, with you</i> ♫

505
00:33:48,020 --> 00:33:50,700
♫ <i>Just with you </i> ♫

506
00:33:50,700 --> 00:33:56,760
♫ <i>So from now on, I will be with you</i> ♫

507
00:33:56,760 --> 00:34:03,320
♫ <i>So plan me into your future. Let me love you</i> ♫

00:34:12,799 --> 00:34:19,940
♫ <i>Just with you </i> ♫

510
00:34:28,940 --> 00:34:30,940
What are you thinking?

511
00:34:32,239 --> 00:34:36,660
Actually, this is not what I had in mind.

512
00:34:36,660 --> 00:34:38,539
So?

513
00:34:38,539 --> 00:34:42,800
So I'm thinking if I'm being brainwashed by you again.

514
00:34:44,299 --> 00:34:47,819
People who are brainwashed don't have this awareness.

515
00:34:47,819 --> 00:34:52,420
It's fine. Even if it's true, then so be it.

516
00:34:53,139 --> 00:34:56,120
You've got more ideas than anyone else.

517
00:34:57,700 --> 00:34:59,719
I'm a little curious.

518
00:35:00,660 --> 00:35:03,679
You took me there and prepared flowers for me.

519
00:35:03,679 --> 00:35:08,420
If I didn't say yes, would you have felt disappointed?

520
00:35:09,500 --> 00:35:11,620
No.

521
00:35:11,620 --> 00:35:13,599
No?

522
00:35:13,599 --> 00:35:16,799
In my opinion, as long as we like each other,

523
00:35:16,799 --> 00:35:19,339
no other things can stand in our way.

524
00:35:20,260 --> 00:35:22,499
What a smooth talker.

525
00:35:23,779 --> 00:35:26,519
With such a sweet mouth and a silver tongue,

526
00:35:26,519 --> 00:35:30,360
those ex-girlfriends of yours must have loved you.

527
00:35:31,179 --> 00:35:34,800
You... That's a pretty quick transition.

528
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:37,500
You've learned to jealous openly.

529
00:35:37,500 --> 00:35:40,139
That's because you deliberately made me jealous.

530
00:35:40,139 --> 00:35:43,780
But I apologized. You just kept talking tough.

531
00:35:43,780 --> 00:35:47,239
When did I talk tough? It just wasn't the right time.

532
00:35:47,239 --> 00:35:50,719
Yes, you only do soft talk.

533
00:35:51,320 --> 00:35:53,320
Annoying.

534
00:36:06,779 --> 00:36:08,600
I'm home.

535
00:36:10,700 --> 00:36:12,260
What if tomorrow you wake up

536
00:36:12,260 --> 00:36:15,919
and tell me that tonight was an accident?

537
00:36:15,919 --> 00:36:17,680
What kind of person do you think I am?

538
00:36:17,680 --> 00:36:19,819
My girlfriend.

539
00:36:20,759 --> 00:36:23,180
But you have a record.

540
00:36:23,779 --> 00:36:25,600
Just relax.

541
00:36:25,600 --> 00:36:29,619
Once I've set my mind on something, I'll try my best to keep it.

542
00:36:30,660 --> 00:36:32,520
If you don't believe me,

543
00:36:33,220 --> 00:36:34,819
let's make a pinky swear.

544
00:36:41,539 --> 00:36:43,220
I'm going home.

545
00:36:54,280 --> 00:36:57,840
What? You forgot something?

546
00:37:05,560 --> 00:37:10,339
Just now, I was busy doing pinky swear, and forgot to leave a stamp.

♫ <i>Looking forward to the next surprising heartbeat</i> ♫

553
00:37:43,339 --> 00:37:47,060
This bouquet looks a bit too garish.

554
00:37:47,060 --> 00:37:50,340
It's not. Only seven colors.

555
00:37:50,340 --> 00:37:52,759
Only seven colors?

556
00:37:52,759 --> 00:37:55,319
Are you going to summon a Dragon Lord?

557
00:37:55,319 --> 00:37:59,120
What are you talking about? This bouquet has a name.

558
00:37:59,120 --> 00:38:02,080
Rainbow.

559
00:38:02,080 --> 00:38:04,900
Two of each color, 14 in all.

560
00:38:04,900 --> 00:38:08,260
14? Does that suggest anything?

561
00:38:08,260 --> 00:38:09,440
Let me tell you.

562
00:38:09,440 --> 00:38:11,719
He also bought pink roses and put them in his house.

563
00:38:11,719 --> 00:38:14,799
I counted them. 13 in total.

564
00:38:14,799 --> 00:38:17,759
1314.
<i>(Chinese slang for "Forever.")</i>

565
00:38:18,500 --> 00:38:21,459
This Lu Zhaoxi is so cunning.

566
00:38:21,459 --> 00:38:25,158
This is not cunning. This is called considerate.

567
00:38:25,158 --> 00:38:27,039
If you like him, he's considerate of you.

568
00:38:27,040 --> 00:38:28,840
If you don't, then it's sick.

569
00:38:28,840 --> 00:38:30,979
I like him.

570
00:38:33,379 --> 00:38:35,639
Yezi, you've changed.

571
00:38:35,639 --> 00:38:40,259
When you read the novels I wrote, you thought they were mushy and gave you goosebumps.

572
00:38:40,259 --> 00:38:44,598
But now you've become the heroine, and you're totally obsessed.

573
00:38:44,598 --> 00:38:47,900
I will read your novels more often.

574
00:38:47,900 --> 00:38:49,020
This is not the point.

575
00:38:49,020 --> 00:38:50,740
Then what's the point?

576
00:38:50,740 --> 00:38:54,199
How did Lu Zhaoxi confess his feelings for you? And how did you accept him?

577
00:38:54,199 --> 00:38:56,238
Elaborate on it.

578
00:38:56,238 --> 00:38:58,639
I knew you wouldn't let me off.

579
00:38:58,639 --> 00:39:01,380
I'm your wingwoman, after all.

580
00:39:01,380 --> 00:39:06,180
All right. Then I'll elaborate on it.
