<i>[Hi Venus]</i>

15
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:29,940
<i>[Episode 15]</i>

16
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:34,900
Yes. I was sensible.

17
00:01:34,900 --> 00:01:39,500
But a lack of material is nothing to me.

18
00:01:39,500 --> 00:01:42,540
I remember I was happy

19
00:01:42,540 --> 00:01:44,599
until my father...

20
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:50,300
died.

21
00:01:52,759 --> 00:01:54,300
Come.

22
00:02:07,999 --> 00:02:10,820
My father died by suicide.

23
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:13,690
What happened?

24
00:02:13,690 --> 00:02:16,240
He was engaged in renovation work.

25
00:02:17,659 --> 00:02:20,980
He wanted to make money to buy a house.

26
00:02:20,980 --> 00:02:23,980
And let our family live a better life.

27
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:31,000
There was a project. He decided to contract labor and materials.

28
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,699
The owner disappeared in the end.

29
00:02:33,699 --> 00:02:37,679
He then borrowed money. Together with the family savings,

30
00:02:37,679 --> 00:02:40,660
he paid the workers' salaries.

31
00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:44,379
The result of several years of hard work were all in vain.

32
00:02:45,739 --> 00:02:50,360
It was too much of a blow to him.

33
00:02:51,459 --> 00:02:54,470
He didn't even have the courage to start over.

34
00:03:01,379 --> 00:03:05,098
Don't drink too fast. Come, eat.

35
00:03:05,098 --> 00:03:07,159
It's okay.

36
00:03:07,159 --> 00:03:09,700
I feel better talking about it.

37
00:03:11,700 --> 00:03:14,921
Don't drink too much. I can't tell if you're drunk.

38
00:03:14,921 --> 00:03:17,610
I'm not afraid of you secretly taking pictures of me and sending them to your mother.

39
00:03:17,610 --> 00:03:19,819
Your focus is that.

40
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:28,379
Then you and your father should have gotten along quite well. Right?

41
00:03:29,980 --> 00:03:33,720
I adored him and I was influenced by him a lot.

42
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:37,150
Do you know why I always wanted to buy a house?

43
00:03:37,150 --> 00:03:41,199
I remember you saying that you wanted to have a home of your own.

44
00:03:41,199 --> 00:03:43,799
- You remember.
- Certainly.

45
00:03:43,799 --> 00:03:46,760
Of course, I remember what you said.

46
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:48,960
You have a good memory.

47
00:03:50,340 --> 00:03:54,880
Since my dad said he wanted to buy a house,

48
00:03:54,880 --> 00:04:00,740
I have been fantasizing about decorating my room beautifully.

49
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:06,939
But then he just left without saying a word.

50
00:04:07,939 --> 00:04:11,600
And then, my mother remarried.

51
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:13,820
The family fell apart.

52
00:04:15,179 --> 00:04:17,200
There are times when I realize...

53
00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:24,420
what I consider indestructible is actually very fragile.

54
00:04:26,340 --> 00:04:28,399
So I thought...

55
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:33,050
I couldn't entrust my hope in life to others,

56
00:04:33,050 --> 00:04:35,240
but only to rely on myself.

57
00:04:36,859 --> 00:04:39,260
That's why I want a home.

58
00:04:39,940 --> 00:04:42,890
A home that you can completely control.

59
00:04:44,459 --> 00:04:49,359
As long as I persist, this home will always be there.

60
00:04:50,579 --> 00:04:52,680
As long as I work hard,

61
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:56,040
this home will be better and better.

62
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:10,299
In fact, human beings are incapable of survival when they are young.

63
00:05:10,299 --> 00:05:11,979
The only way is to rely on their parents.

64
00:05:11,979 --> 00:05:16,600
So family affection is innately engraved in the genes.

65
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:20,279
Love doesn't fade away when people grow up.

66
00:05:20,279 --> 00:05:26,850
People will continue to have friendship, love, sympathy, or compassion for others.

67
00:05:26,850 --> 00:05:29,679
Because the human world itself is complex and changeable.

68
00:05:29,679 --> 00:05:32,099
People are fragile and sensitive creatures.

69
00:05:32,099 --> 00:05:34,240
It is easy to have all kinds of emotions.

70
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:38,070
So we need to be listened to and comforted.

71
00:05:38,070 --> 00:05:43,439
Therefore, people must not only maintain independence but also learn to be depended on.

72
00:05:44,019 --> 00:05:47,300
When someone leaves you, you're able to live well.

73
00:05:47,300 --> 00:05:52,199
When relying on others, an effort can be made to take a step forward.

74
00:05:58,900 --> 00:06:01,479
I like hearing you talk.

75
00:06:03,459 --> 00:06:05,200
Me too.

76
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:14,558
Have more food.

77
00:06:14,559 --> 00:06:16,599
No one is allowed to leave until we finish all these dishes.

78
00:06:16,599 --> 00:06:19,140
Want to earn my rent again?

79
00:06:40,780 --> 00:06:43,500
I see you order sandwiches a lot at the store.

80
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:47,219
Do you like eating sandwiches or want to save money for me?

81
00:06:47,219 --> 00:06:48,439
I can't say I like it.

82
00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:51,879
I'm just used to it. It's easy and convenient.

83
00:06:52,319 --> 00:06:54,579
Are you busy at work?

84
00:06:54,579 --> 00:06:56,140
Being busy is good.

85
00:06:56,140 --> 00:06:59,170
It's just there is a temporary thing that needs to be dealt with.

86
00:07:00,100 --> 00:07:05,600
It's frustrating to be interrupted while having a proper meal, isn't it?

87
00:07:08,039 --> 00:07:12,118
Is it your author's habit to ask "why"?

88
00:07:13,900 --> 00:07:18,679
Sort of. The character's personality traits, characteristics, reasons for their choice of job,

89
00:07:18,679 --> 00:07:20,899
set the psychology and goals of the character.

90
00:07:20,899 --> 00:07:25,039
If there are these, the characters will be more rich and three-dimensional.

91
00:07:30,179 --> 00:07:32,300
You eat so fast!

92
00:07:32,300 --> 00:07:34,759
People often say that.

93
00:07:34,759 --> 00:07:37,639
Actually, I wanted to add this feature to the novel before.

94
00:07:37,639 --> 00:07:41,510
As the cause of Kevin's love of strawberry smoothies.

95
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:46,800
But now I have whitewashed Kevin. Can these still be written?

96
00:07:46,820 --> 00:07:48,720
Tell me the story.

97
00:07:50,319 --> 00:07:53,340
Blood sugar rises quickly because of eating too fast

98
00:07:53,340 --> 00:07:55,940
which makes Kevin more prone to hypoglycemia.

99
00:07:55,940 --> 00:07:59,179
So he takes the thermos loaded with a strawberry smoothie.

100
00:07:59,179 --> 00:08:01,320
In case he's busy at work, having no time to eat on time,

101
00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:03,610
sugar can be replenished at any time.

102
00:08:08,340 --> 00:08:10,320
It's not good, right?

103
00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:14,999
No, you hit the mark. That's exactly me.

104
00:08:21,139 --> 00:08:23,339
You can write it if you want to.

105
00:08:23,339 --> 00:08:25,039
Thank you.

106
00:08:26,019 --> 00:08:28,940
Isn't your female friend one of my regular readers?

107
00:08:28,940 --> 00:08:32,138
If you want Kevin to show some kind of charm, you can tell me.

108
00:08:32,138 --> 00:08:34,420
I'll find a way to write it in.

109
00:08:34,420 --> 00:08:37,940
You said last time, she's subtly rejecting me.

110
00:08:40,059 --> 00:08:43,019
You can try harder.

111
00:08:46,499 --> 00:08:49,280
Do you hate readers giving you advice?

112
00:08:50,699 --> 00:08:53,930
Of course, I hate it if they simply curse me. The rest is fine.

113
00:08:53,930 --> 00:08:55,290
I used to be very depressed.

114
00:08:55,290 --> 00:08:57,490
Then I figured it out. So I'm okay with that.

115
00:08:57,499 --> 00:08:59,579
What do you mean?

116
00:09:01,540 --> 00:09:06,179
No matter how I write the stories, I can't make everyone happy.

117
00:09:06,179 --> 00:09:08,280
Take the novel I wrote.

118
00:09:08,280 --> 00:09:12,179
If I keep writing about the love story of the main characters, there will be people who say:

119
00:09:12,179 --> 00:09:14,179
"Don't they have to work?"

120
00:09:14,179 --> 00:09:15,900
Of course, they have to work.

121
00:09:15,900 --> 00:09:19,839
But I can't write in detail about how they do the slides, right?

122
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:22,940
If the work part is too much, someone will say:

123
00:09:22,940 --> 00:09:25,450
"My own work has been so tiring, I don't want to see this.

124
00:09:25,450 --> 00:09:27,930
I just want to see love stories."

125
00:09:27,939 --> 00:09:30,918
- I do see these kinds of comment.
- Right?

126
00:09:30,918 --> 00:09:32,720
If the emotional progress of the main characters is fast,

127
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:34,990
there will be people who say: "How did they get together?"

128
00:09:34,998 --> 00:09:36,980
If the progress is slow, someone will say:

129
00:09:36,980 --> 00:09:39,650
"What are they waiting for? What are they doing?"

130
00:09:39,659 --> 00:09:44,498
When the main characters finally get together, someone will come out and say:

131
00:09:44,498 --> 00:09:48,750
"I only like it when they're almost lovers."

132
00:09:50,579 --> 00:09:55,340
I've seen some comments saying that it's boring after dating.

133
00:09:55,340 --> 00:09:57,120
Some will say:

134
00:09:57,120 --> 00:10:00,180
"I like to see the daily life of the main characters. I need 100 chapters."

135
00:10:00,180 --> 00:10:03,860
Some people also say: "So boring, no conflict."

136
00:10:03,860 --> 00:10:05,540
But these are considered good.

137
00:10:05,540 --> 00:10:07,558
The most difficult comments are

138
00:10:07,559 --> 00:10:10,100
that some people say that the three concepts of the character's perfection are not correct.

139
00:10:10,100 --> 00:10:12,760
The author's three concepts of perfection are wrong.

140
00:10:12,760 --> 00:10:14,860
Of course, my three concepts are wrong.

141
00:10:14,860 --> 00:10:18,840
Because I don't even know what the three concepts of perfection are.

142
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:22,878
I prefer the complexity of people to the abstract three views of perfection.

143
00:10:22,878 --> 00:10:26,659
You wrote about a character named Xiaoyan. I like him.

144
00:10:26,659 --> 00:10:28,059
He lives like a mudfish.

145
00:10:28,059 --> 00:10:30,740
He will be jealous when he sees others better himself.

146
00:10:30,740 --> 00:10:34,358
He will be uneasy when he plays a dirty trick. Very interesting.

147
00:10:34,358 --> 00:10:36,180
I am also very satisfied with the shaping of this character.

148
00:10:36,180 --> 00:10:39,520
Xiaoyan is in a novel I wrote a year ago.

149
00:10:41,379 --> 00:10:43,559
How would you know?

150
00:10:45,100 --> 00:10:48,400
My friend said that was a good story and recommended that I read it.

151
00:10:48,990 --> 00:10:51,230
By the way, I'm a little curious.

152
00:10:51,230 --> 00:10:53,670
Can you read this type of novel?

153
00:10:53,679 --> 00:10:55,159
I'm okay with it.

154
00:10:55,159 --> 00:11:00,100
I will trouble you a lot from now on.

155
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,660
I told you. I'll come and wash them later.

156
00:11:12,660 --> 00:11:16,440
You cooked the meal. If I don't wash the dishes, it doesn't mean I eat for nothing.

157
00:11:17,340 --> 00:11:19,479
Why is your face turning red?

158
00:11:20,500 --> 00:11:24,400
I feel hot. I drank too much.

159
00:11:24,420 --> 00:11:25,819
Are you sober?

160
00:11:25,819 --> 00:11:28,440
I'm good. How about you?

161
00:11:28,479 --> 00:11:30,280
My head is spinning.

162
00:11:32,900 --> 00:11:37,058
You should take some sausages to your parents. My mom sent a lot.

163
00:11:37,579 --> 00:11:41,239
Good. As a birthday gift for my mom.

164
00:11:41,239 --> 00:11:42,819
When is her birthday?

165
00:11:42,819 --> 00:11:44,459
In a couple of days.

166
00:11:45,579 --> 00:11:47,860
How do you usually celebrate it?

167
00:11:47,860 --> 00:11:51,139
My mom likes to keep it simple. Just a family dinner.

168
00:11:51,139 --> 00:11:54,000
Cut a cake, make a wish.

169
00:11:55,599 --> 00:11:58,939
My mom's birthday wish last year was hoping for me to get a girlfriend.

170
00:11:58,939 --> 00:12:00,660
This year is almost over.

171
00:12:00,660 --> 00:12:03,400
This wish is also going to expire.

172
00:12:04,939 --> 00:12:08,220
You can let your mother make the same wish this year.

173
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,180
How about you pretend to be my girlfriend once?

174
00:12:11,180 --> 00:12:13,259
My mom would be so happy.

175
00:12:13,950 --> 00:12:16,500
You're going to ask Qiao Yu out.

176
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:18,880
You should go find her.

177
00:12:20,680 --> 00:12:22,540
Right.

178
00:12:30,599 --> 00:12:32,040
What's wrong?

179
00:12:32,040 --> 00:12:34,500
- I bumped my head, and it hurts.
- Are you okay?

180
00:12:35,139 --> 00:12:36,900
Let me take a look.

181
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:41,459
Is this it?

182
00:12:41,459 --> 00:12:42,519
It hurts.

183
00:12:42,519 --> 00:12:45,439
No bleeding. Just a little red.

184
00:12:45,439 --> 00:12:46,779
Do you have medicine at home?

185
00:12:46,779 --> 00:12:49,719
No, it's okay.

186
00:12:49,719 --> 00:12:51,420
It hurts.

187
00:13:02,340 --> 00:13:06,050
My mom said this will relieve the pain.

188
00:13:07,599 --> 00:13:09,740
My mom also said that.

189
00:13:10,220 --> 00:13:13,700
Then I'll keep blowing on it.

Okay.

210
00:14:56,619 --> 00:15:00,080
- Bye-bye.
- Bye-bye.

211
00:15:29,939 --> 00:15:32,200
Am I drunk?

212
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:34,220
Or is she drunk?

213
00:15:35,259 --> 00:15:38,459
It's not like we're cheating. Why am I in a hurry to leave?

214
00:15:41,939 --> 00:15:44,910
Why do I always drop the ball at the last minute?

I must be crazy!

219
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:40,939
I can't drink so much wine.

220
00:16:40,939 --> 00:16:43,259
How could I kiss him?

221
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,020
Drinking is a mistake.

222
00:16:46,020 --> 00:16:50,079
I'm done! I have to work tomorrow. How can I go to work?

223
00:16:52,459 --> 00:16:54,819
I'm done.

224
00:17:01,740 --> 00:17:04,298
President, did your car break down?

225
00:17:04,298 --> 00:17:06,519
Why did you suddenly ask me to pick you up?

226
00:17:06,519 --> 00:17:08,760
I had wine.

227
00:17:08,760 --> 00:17:10,720
Early in the morning?

228
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:12,680
Last night.

229
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:15,900
You're very careful.

230
00:17:16,460 --> 00:17:18,180
Then I lost sleep.

231
00:17:18,180 --> 00:17:20,139
Lost sleep?

232
00:17:20,139 --> 00:17:22,180
Shouldn't you sleep better after drinking?

233
00:17:22,180 --> 00:17:24,639
I drank with Ye Shilan.

234
00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:29,590
You confessed after drinking and got rejected?

235
00:17:33,139 --> 00:17:36,220
Can't you think in a good direction?

236
00:17:36,220 --> 00:17:37,480
Are you two together?

237
00:17:37,480 --> 00:17:39,659
That's not true.

238
00:17:39,659 --> 00:17:43,599
But... I confirmed her feelings.

239
00:17:44,139 --> 00:17:47,370
So the solution I offer worked?

240
00:17:47,370 --> 00:17:49,118
She can't hold her breath anymore.

241
00:17:49,119 --> 00:17:52,100
I don't think the big moves in the back are going to work.

242
00:17:53,279 --> 00:17:56,640
So you're just showing off to me early in the morning.

243
00:17:57,900 --> 00:18:01,400
How can this be called showing off? It's called sharing joy.

244
00:18:02,979 --> 00:18:05,710
I think you may be a little early to be happy.

245
00:18:06,300 --> 00:18:08,359
Can you not just kill off a conversation?

246
00:18:08,359 --> 00:18:10,740
Just a personal intuition.

247
00:18:30,019 --> 00:18:32,160
Ye Shilan. Morning.

248
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:34,159
Good morning, President.

249
00:18:46,739 --> 00:18:50,839
President, I have something to say to you.

250
00:18:50,839 --> 00:18:52,020
What's up?

251
00:18:52,020 --> 00:18:54,590
Last night, we got drunk.

252
00:18:54,590 --> 00:18:57,470
Just pretend that nothing happened.

253
00:19:00,560 --> 00:19:03,120
When it happens, it happens.

254
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:06,580
Should we forget or take it as a dream?

255
00:19:06,580 --> 00:19:10,710
Because I think it was an accident.

256
00:19:10,710 --> 00:19:12,899
Last time, you said it was an accident.

257
00:19:12,899 --> 00:19:14,939
The last time was an accident.

258
00:19:14,939 --> 00:19:16,970
Last time it was. Then this time it was not,

259
00:19:16,970 --> 00:19:19,110
but why did you say it is?

260
00:19:19,580 --> 00:19:21,959
Because I remember you said

261
00:19:21,959 --> 00:19:26,760
some attractions can be triggered by some atmosphere.

262
00:19:26,760 --> 00:19:29,430
Last night was the situation.

263
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:34,720
Last night, we talked a lot. We were too close to each other.

264
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:37,010
Plus some alcohol stimulation.

265
00:19:37,010 --> 00:19:39,430
That's why we lost control for a while.

266
00:19:42,979 --> 00:19:46,479
Think about it. Am I right?

267
00:19:49,420 --> 00:19:53,760
Are you sure it's like this after you think about it carefully?

268
00:19:58,180 --> 00:20:02,039
I think you're right. This should be the case.

269
00:20:02,039 --> 00:20:05,619
And just like you said, lips are just an organ.

270
00:20:05,619 --> 00:20:07,320
It's not a big deal.

271
00:20:11,300 --> 00:20:13,359
Anything else you want to say?

272
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:15,739
No more.

273
00:20:15,739 --> 00:20:17,300
I'll let you go.

274
00:20:17,979 --> 00:20:19,599
Good.

275
00:20:27,180 --> 00:20:29,320
It shouldn't be like this.

276
00:20:31,499 --> 00:20:33,520

288
00:21:52,018 --> 00:21:53,739
which has very good feedback online.

289
00:21:53,739 --> 00:21:57,610
Her agency is also willing to cooperate with her transformation.

290
00:21:57,610 --> 00:22:00,618
I saw it. Her agency also sent out a press release,

291
00:22:00,630 --> 00:22:02,580
saying that they dispelled rumors at the time

292
00:22:02,580 --> 00:22:04,530
was because the documentary project was confidential.

293
00:22:04,539 --> 00:22:08,919
Yes. We should also give the fans an out.

294

How did you come up with the idea

295
00:22:11,340 --> 00:22:14,350
before she was actually willing to participate in the shooting?

296
00:22:16,039 --> 00:22:18,259
An expert helped me.

297
00:22:18,259 --> 00:22:19,720
Who?

298
00:22:19,720 --> 00:22:21,439
Ye Shilan.

299
00:22:24,900 --> 00:22:28,780
I heard from your mother that she was a pediatrician before.

300
00:22:28,780 --> 00:22:31,918
Just a temporary assistant. She will go back soon.

301
00:22:34,859 --> 00:22:36,920
You have a crush on her.

302
00:22:43,019 --> 00:22:45,220
Is it obvious?

303
00:22:45,220 --> 00:22:49,079
When you talk about her, you can't help but smile.

304
00:22:55,180 --> 00:22:57,660
How about you do me a favor?

305
00:22:58,499 --> 00:23:00,099
Shoot.

306
00:23:02,739 --> 00:23:05,318
It's a deal then. Don't go back on your word.

307
00:23:05,318 --> 00:23:07,919
I am a poor actor. Don't blame me if I bomb.

308
00:23:07,919 --> 00:23:09,920
Don't worry. We have a tacit understanding.

309
00:23:09,920 --> 00:23:13,439
Ye Shilan, do you want to have lunch together?

310
00:23:14,259 --> 00:23:16,760
No, I'm okay.

311
00:23:17,420 --> 00:23:19,419
What do you want to eat?

312
00:23:19,419 --> 00:23:22,160
- Hotpot.
- Okay, let's have hotpot.

<i>[Vice President's Office]</i>

314

The place where Dr. Ye did voluntary work

315
00:23:43,630 --> 00:23:48,110
is Taoyuan Village, right?

316
00:23:48,110 --> 00:23:50,180
You have a good memory.

317
00:23:52,199 --> 00:23:56,339
In the future, everything decided by the president is enough with his signature.

318
00:23:56,339 --> 00:23:57,738
The process still needs to be done.

319
00:23:57,738 --> 00:24:02,579
And it involves the expense budget, which has always been under your management.

320

Do you know that the group will send someone to the hospital for an audit?

Yes, I do. Annual routine audit.

00:24:11,619 --> 00:24:15,710
Does the president tell you who will be the receptionist?

323
00:24:15,710 --> 00:24:17,319
Me.

324
00:24:18,399 --> 00:24:20,858
When the time comes, you'll be very busy.

325
00:24:20,858 --> 00:24:25,280
When you're in need, don't hesitate to ask me for help.

326
00:24:25,280 --> 00:24:26,660
Thank you, President Gao.

327
00:24:26,660 --> 00:24:29,260
If it's okay, I have to go now.

328
00:24:40,639 --> 00:24:42,640
Are you off work?

329
00:24:43,979 --> 00:24:45,500
Are you busy later?

330
00:24:45,500 --> 00:24:46,660
No.

331
00:24:46,660 --> 00:24:48,519
Here's the deal.

332
00:24:48,519 --> 00:24:51,179
Qiao Yu promised to go with me to my mom's birthday party tomorrow.

333
00:24:51,179 --> 00:24:53,610
The dress we took fancy to that day.

334
00:24:53,610 --> 00:24:55,100
I just showed the photo to Qiao Yu.

335
00:24:55,100 --> 00:24:57,450
She likes it and wants to wear it tomorrow.

336
00:24:57,459 --> 00:24:59,459
Go and buy it and bring it back.

337
00:25:00,540 --> 00:25:02,618
Doesn't she need to try it on herself?

338
00:25:02,618 --> 00:25:05,278
No need. Her size is just like yours.

339
00:25:05,278 --> 00:25:07,119
The money will be transferred to you later.

340
00:25:12,540 --> 00:25:14,139
Is there a problem?

341
00:25:15,180 --> 00:25:17,059
Not at all.

342
00:25:18,030 --> 00:25:19,810
I'll go swimming with Qiao Yu later.

343
00:25:19,810 --> 00:25:22,830
Bring it to me after you buy it. I'll send you the address.

344
00:25:23,499 --> 00:25:26,719
Sure. I got it.

345
00:25:40,959 --> 00:25:43,579
Go swimming together.

346
00:25:43,579 --> 00:25:46,239
They all love sports.

347
00:26:27,259 --> 00:26:29,519
There are so many dresses in the mall.

348
00:26:29,519 --> 00:26:32,119
She must choose this one.

349
00:26:32,119 --> 00:26:33,899
Really...

350
00:27:06,859 --> 00:27:09,219
Why don't you just go out and wait?

351
00:27:10,259 --> 00:27:12,520
I have to seize the moment.

352
00:27:13,619 --> 00:27:16,300
Who gave you this bad idea?

353
00:27:16,879 --> 00:27:18,499
That's a secret.

354
00:27:30,660 --> 00:27:32,420
<i>How long will it take you to get here?</i>

355
00:27:32,420 --> 00:27:35,839
<i>I told the front desk you would come. Just come straight in.</i>

356
00:27:41,580 --> 00:27:44,070
<i>Okay. Fifteen minutes.</i>

357
00:27:49,619 --> 00:27:51,678
Hello. Where is the pool?

358
00:27:51,678 --> 00:27:54,479
- On this side.
- Thank you.

359
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:02,839
She is coming.

360
00:28:08,319 --> 00:28:11,600
Splash me.

361
00:28:15,400 --> 00:28:17,879
Splash you!

362
00:28:17,879 --> 00:28:19,339
Okay!

363
00:28:26,260 --> 00:28:28,680
Come or not?

364
00:28:28,680 --> 00:28:29,780
Stop it! Okay.

365
00:28:29,780 --> 00:28:32,180
You win!

366
00:28:32,180 --> 00:28:33,880
President.

367
00:28:55,879 --> 00:28:57,640
You're here.

368
00:29:01,399 --> 00:29:03,319
You can put it here.

369
00:29:07,859 --> 00:29:10,919
Since you're here, do you want to swim together?

370
00:29:10,919 --> 00:29:13,140
No, thank you. I can't swim.

371
00:29:13,140 --> 00:29:14,939
I'll teach you.

372
00:29:18,750 --> 00:29:21,650
Teaching people to swim is too intimate.

373
00:29:21,650 --> 00:29:23,500
I don't think it's a good idea.

374
00:29:26,420 --> 00:29:31,160
Yeah. If there is any misunderstanding, it's difficult to explain.

375
00:29:33,700 --> 00:29:35,499
I have to go now.

376
00:29:37,060 --> 00:29:39,760
Well... Are you leaving now?

377
00:29:40,219 --> 00:29:41,940
Is there anything else?

378
00:29:42,840 --> 00:29:44,640
Nothing.

379
00:29:59,540 --> 00:30:02,400
Are you competing for who is more anxious?

380
00:30:02,979 --> 00:30:05,920
She denied the feelings between us first.

381
00:30:06,979 --> 00:30:09,218
Your behavior is really childish.

382
00:30:09,218 --> 00:30:12,020
Who would make the woman he likes angry?

383
00:30:12,020 --> 00:30:14,319
I didn't do it to piss her off.

384
00:30:15,460 --> 00:30:20,100
She doesn't know we're just good friends.

385
00:30:20,100 --> 00:30:22,059
And you know she likes you.

386
00:30:22,059 --> 00:30:25,640
She's going to be pissed since you did this to her.

387
00:30:27,499 --> 00:30:29,540
I already regret it.

388
00:30:30,239 --> 00:30:34,120
Then you should think about how to take the initiative to win her back.

389
00:30:34,120 --> 00:30:37,310
I don't want to be the emotional stumbling block between you two.

390
00:30:46,840 --> 00:30:48,518
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

391
00:30:48,518 --> 00:30:52,700
You two have kissed. But you went to explain to him.

392
00:30:52,700 --> 00:30:55,240
I have to work and face him.

393
00:30:55,240 --> 00:30:56,730
What else can I do?

394
00:30:56,739 --> 00:30:58,719
Wait for him to confess to you.

395
00:30:58,719 --> 00:30:59,979
He doesn't like me.

396
00:30:59,979 --> 00:31:02,119
Then he still kissed you.

397
00:31:02,119 --> 00:31:04,719
He initiated it. How do I know?

398
00:31:04,760 --> 00:31:06,190
This is not an excuse.

399
00:31:06,190 --> 00:31:07,790
Then you wait for him to explain to you.

400
00:31:07,799 --> 00:31:09,900
See what he says.

401
00:31:09,900 --> 00:31:12,119
But he wants to get his ex back.

402
00:31:12,119 --> 00:31:14,480
I can't give him trouble.

403
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:17,580
Come on. You like him.

404
00:31:17,580 --> 00:31:20,699
You don't worry about who he wants to get back.

405
00:31:20,699 --> 00:31:23,320
What kind of brain circuit do you have?

406
00:31:23,320 --> 00:31:25,920
So now it's like this.

407
00:31:30,100 --> 00:31:31,590
You said he doesn't like you.

408
00:31:31,590 --> 00:31:34,190
That's just your own thought.

409
00:31:34,198 --> 00:31:36,299
Even if he says he wants to get his ex back,

410
00:31:36,299 --> 00:31:38,899
that could also be before he realized that he likes you.

411
00:31:38,899 --> 00:31:43,119
Just like before. That was just your own thoughts.

412
00:31:44,119 --> 00:31:48,639
And the moment you kissed, you must have been excited.

413
00:31:48,639 --> 00:31:50,660
But you went to explain to him.

414
00:31:50,660 --> 00:31:52,200
It hurts.

415
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:54,498
You keep pushing him to the side of his ex-girlfriend.

416
00:31:54,498 --> 00:31:58,119
See? Hurting yourself so much!

417
00:31:58,859 --> 00:32:01,520
I'm regretting it a bit now.

418
00:32:01,520 --> 00:32:03,060
And I'm very angry.

419
00:32:03,060 --> 00:32:05,159
Angry?

420
00:32:05,159 --> 00:32:07,799
Do you know what he did off work?

421
00:32:07,800 --> 00:32:09,620
What is it?

422
00:32:10,190 --> 00:32:12,220
We went shopping together before.

423
00:32:12,220 --> 00:32:14,210
There was a dress I really liked.

424
00:32:14,219 --> 00:32:16,420
I planned to buy it after payday.

425
00:32:16,420 --> 00:32:18,839
Tomorrow, Qiao Yu will spend her birthday with his mother.

426
00:32:18,839 --> 00:32:22,310
He asked me to buy the dress and bring it to Qiao Yu.

427
00:32:22,310 --> 00:32:23,919
That's not all.

428
00:32:23,919 --> 00:32:25,419
They went swimming together.

429
00:32:25,419 --> 00:32:27,899
He told me to send the dress to the swimming pool.

430
00:32:27,899 --> 00:32:31,440
Look at them flirting in the pool.

431
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:32,960
So?

432
00:32:33,619 --> 00:32:35,259
So it is very annoying.

433
00:32:35,259 --> 00:32:37,219
You pushed him away.

434
00:32:37,219 --> 00:32:38,939
You didn't say you liked him.

435
00:32:38,939 --> 00:32:41,300
Why does he consider your feelings?

436
00:32:41,300 --> 00:32:43,379
Whose side are you on?

437
00:32:43,379 --> 00:32:46,980
I'm afraid if I scold Lu Zhaoxi, you will defend him.

438
00:32:49,339 --> 00:32:52,920
I shot myself in the foot.

439
00:32:55,700 --> 00:33:00,660
The plot you said is so similar to the episode of one of my novels.

440
00:33:00,660 --> 00:33:02,799
What plot?

441
00:33:02,799 --> 00:33:04,699
In order to make the female lead jealous,

442
00:33:04,699 --> 00:33:08,770
the male lead goes swimming with a female friend and deliberately lets the heroine see it.

443
00:33:08,770 --> 00:33:10,960
Why go swimming?

444
00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:13,560
This is how it should be conceived.

445
00:33:13,560 --> 00:33:16,098
First of all, swimming is very cool.

446
00:33:16,098 --> 00:33:19,500
It especially shows the male hormones.

447
00:33:26,379 --> 00:33:29,498
Second, with the opposite sex in the swimming pool,

448
00:33:29,498 --> 00:33:32,018
it's easy to create ambiguous feelings,

449
00:33:32,018 --> 00:33:35,240
which can stimulate thejealousy of heroines the most.

450
00:33:48,580 --> 00:33:50,299
So how does it go?

451
00:33:50,299 --> 00:33:55,078
Later, the heroine is stimulated and realized she likes the male lead a lot.

452
00:33:55,078 --> 00:33:57,519
So she kisses him bravely.

453
00:33:57,519 --> 00:33:59,339
In the swimming pool?

454
00:34:00,499 --> 00:34:04,260
Sure enough, there is a reason why I don't like reading these kinds of novels.

455
00:34:04,260 --> 00:34:06,520
You're just not that brave.

456
00:34:12,500 --> 00:34:14,899
The solution you mentioned was really too unreliable.

457
00:34:14,899 --> 00:34:16,979
It doesn't work on Ye Shilan.

458
00:34:16,979 --> 00:34:20,478
<i>Using the relationship with Qiao Yu, you started it yourself.</i>

459
00:34:20,478 --> 00:34:22,058
But you suggested trying harder.

460
00:34:22,058 --> 00:34:24,138
You said to give her some pool stimulation.

461
00:34:24,138 --> 00:34:25,518
As a result, she was jealous and ran away.

462
00:34:25,518 --> 00:34:27,219
I am the one who is stimulated by this.

463
00:34:27,219 --> 00:34:30,899
<i>You're not stimulated. Aren't you distressed?</i>

464
00:34:30,899 --> 00:34:33,760
Yes. I feel sorry to her.

465
00:34:33,760 --> 00:34:36,098
I just don't want to see her in a bad mood.

466
00:34:36,098 --> 00:34:37,180
Can you not?

467
00:34:37,180 --> 00:34:40,240
<i>Sure. I understand.</i>

468
00:34:41,439 --> 00:34:43,559
In fact, I should have figured it out earlier.

469
00:34:43,559 --> 00:34:47,770
Ye Shilan is not a proactive person in relationships.

470
00:34:47,770 --> 00:34:50,120
She may retreat when encountering difficulties.

471
00:34:50,120 --> 00:34:52,020
<i>Then you'd better admit defeat early.</i>

472
00:34:52,020 --> 00:34:53,639
It's okay to admit defeat.

473
00:34:53,639 --> 00:34:56,399
But we can't lose too rashly, right?

474
00:34:58,819 --> 00:35:00,839
Okay, time to go to sleep.

475
00:35:00,839 --> 00:35:02,439
<i>Okay.</i>

476
00:35:18,300 --> 00:35:23,150
♫ <i>Stars light up the sky</i> ♫

477
00:35:24,350 --> 00:35:29,500
♫ <i>Whisper by my side</i> ♫

478
00:35:29,500 --> 00:35:39,500
♫ <i>All over the world says, "good night"</i> ♫

479
00:35:41,900 --> 00:35:47,750
♫ <i>Get lost in the crowd</i> ♫

480
00:35:47,750 --> 00:35:52,900
♫ <i>Have you followed behind</i> ♫

481
00:35:52,900 --> 00:35:58,750
♫ <i>Rainbow. Sunshine</i> ♫

482
00:35:58,750 --> 00:36:04,720
♫ <i>Recurring every time we met</i> ♫

483
00:36:05,700 --> 00:36:11,250

<i>I need your help with a private matter.</i>

502

Okay.

506
00:37:36,020 --> 00:37:37,779
President.

507
00:37:39,539 --> 00:37:41,619
What can I do for you?

508
00:37:42,139 --> 00:37:44,399
This is private time.

509
00:37:45,859 --> 00:37:48,860
Lu Zhaoxi. Shoot.

510
00:37:48,860 --> 00:37:51,580
I want you to help me buy some flowers to put in my home.

511
00:37:51,600 --> 00:37:55,300
You go help me pick the flowers, then afterward you can conveniently help me again to deal with them.

512
00:37:55,300 --> 00:37:57,000
Okay. Let's go.

513
00:37:59,339 --> 00:38:02,640
One more thing. Qiao Yu has something to do temporarily.

514
00:38:02,640 --> 00:38:05,998
She can't eat with my mom. I need you to come in for the rescue.

515
00:38:07,439 --> 00:38:10,820
I don't think so. I can't help you with that.

516
00:38:10,820 --> 00:38:12,000
Why?

517
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:14,159
How can you explain to Qiao Yu later?

518
00:38:14,159 --> 00:38:16,120
She knows I'm here to see you.

519
00:38:16,120 --> 00:38:17,900
She might be testing you.

520
00:38:17,900 --> 00:38:20,100
Don't be a fool.

521
00:38:20,100 --> 00:38:22,239
This isn't something you need to worry about.

522
00:38:22,239 --> 00:38:24,659
And... your mother knows our relationship.

523
00:38:24,659 --> 00:38:25,958
This is not believable.

524
00:38:25,959 --> 00:38:30,200
I know. So I'll tell her I'm the one chasing you.

525
00:38:30,200 --> 00:38:31,959
You haven't agreed yet.

526
00:38:31,959 --> 00:38:34,079
Then you can just lie to yourself.

527
00:38:34,079 --> 00:38:36,079
I don't need to go.

528
00:38:36,079 --> 00:38:39,219
Since you don't need to appear, is it better to say I like Qiao Yu?

529
00:38:39,219 --> 00:38:41,000
Makes sense.

530
00:38:42,779 --> 00:38:44,640
That's why it's necessary.

531
00:38:44,640 --> 00:38:46,578
My mom knows I have a target.

532
00:38:46,578 --> 00:38:47,818
And you're willing to attend.

533
00:38:47,818 --> 00:38:49,500
It means you love me, too.

534
00:38:49,500 --> 00:38:51,260
You're just a little hesitant for now.

535
00:38:51,260 --> 00:38:53,899
In this way, my mom will have more to look forward to.

536
00:38:53,899 --> 00:38:55,939
This lie is too outrageous.

537
00:38:55,939 --> 00:38:57,338
How can you call it a lie?

538
00:38:57,338 --> 00:38:58,659
You are attracted to me.

539
00:38:58,659 --> 00:39:00,058
Who is attracted to you?

540
00:39:00,058 --> 00:39:01,058
Then why did you kiss me?

541
00:39:01,058 --> 00:39:02,339
You kissed me, too.

542
00:39:02,339 --> 00:39:04,280
I felt something.

543
00:39:08,679 --> 00:39:12,470
Didn't I explain it to you?

544
00:39:14,180 --> 00:39:16,280
You didn't understand?

545
00:39:17,220 --> 00:39:19,159
I understand.

546
00:39:19,159 --> 00:39:22,620
What you mean is we both felt something at that time.

547
00:39:22,620 --> 00:39:25,379
It's just that you think it was the atmosphere.

548
00:39:25,379 --> 00:39:27,520
It's only temporary, right?

549
00:39:29,379 --> 00:39:31,940
Is this a work assignment?

550
00:39:32,519 --> 00:39:33,920
Of course not.

551
00:39:33,920 --> 00:39:36,040
Can I refuse then?

552
00:39:36,819 --> 00:39:37,699
Yes.

553
00:39:37,699 --> 00:39:40,799
Good. Then I refuse.

554
00:39:41,600 --> 00:39:44,220
Fine. I'll go buy the flowers myself.

555
00:39:44,220 --> 00:39:45,640
You can go now.

556
00:39:45,640 --> 00:39:47,339
Good.

557
00:39:48,900 --> 00:39:52,878
<i>I, Ye Shilan, asked Lu Zhaoxi to pretend to be my boyfriend to eat with my mom.</i>

558
00:39:52,878 --> 00:39:55,590
<i>Here, I promise him a request unconditionally.</i>

559
00:39:55,590 --> 00:39:56,710
<i>The premise is not to break the law.</i>

560
00:39:56,719 --> 00:39:58,818
<i>The above is a note of indebtedness. Over.</i>

561
00:40:02,420 --> 00:40:04,500
What are you doing?

562
00:40:04,500 --> 00:40:07,738
I want to use this IOU now. Is it possible?

563
00:40:09,640 --> 00:40:13,758
It's an IOU. I can't deny it.

564
00:40:13,758 --> 00:40:16,578
Good. You walk the walk. I like it.

565
00:40:17,059 --> 00:40:20,360
Do you want to put your favorite dress on?

566
00:40:21,700 --> 00:40:23,298
You don't think I look good in this suit?

567
00:40:23,298 --> 00:40:26,859
You're beautiful. It's okay if you don't wear it.

568
00:40:26,859 --> 00:40:30,600
Why not? I also want to be beautiful even if for paying off my debts.

569
00:40:30,600 --> 00:40:33,118
I need to powder my nose. Just wait here.

570
00:40:33,118 --> 00:40:35,779
Okay, no rush.

571
00:40:43,900 --> 00:40:45,500
