<i>[Hi Venus]</i>

15
00:01:27,079 --> 00:01:29,840
<i>[Episode 10]</i>

16
00:01:36,919 --> 00:01:39,019
The driver is here. I'll go.

17
00:01:39,019 --> 00:01:40,639
I'll take you downstairs.

18
00:01:40,639 --> 00:01:43,138
By the way, let me remind you again.

19
00:01:43,138 --> 00:01:46,819
Behave better tomorrow and leave yourself a way out.

20
00:01:46,819 --> 00:01:49,299
In case something happens to you two in the future,

21
00:01:49,299 --> 00:01:51,360
you won't be too passive.

22
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:55,060
I'm just doing my friend a favor, don't think too much about it.

23
00:01:56,060 --> 00:01:58,399
You just said that Assistant Ye

24
00:01:58,400 --> 00:02:00,840
also promised you a random condition?

25
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:04,719
Then ask her to pretend to be your girlfriend

26
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:07,740
and have dinner with me to make me happy.

27
00:02:08,559 --> 00:02:09,838
Be good, Mom.

28
00:02:09,839 --> 00:02:11,519
Don't give such bad ideas.

29
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:12,640
Can't you?

30
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:14,100
Think about it.

31
00:02:14,100 --> 00:02:16,558
Okay. I'll think about it, Mom.

32
00:02:16,559 --> 00:02:18,220
You promised.

33
00:02:23,220 --> 00:02:25,918
<i>President, we need to meet in advance tomorrow</i>

34
00:02:25,919 --> 00:02:27,760
<i>for an emergency meeting.</i>

35
00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:42,879
President Ye, the meeting can start now.

36
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:44,779
President Ye?

37
00:02:44,779 --> 00:02:46,100
Today, you are President Ye.

38
00:02:46,100 --> 00:02:48,960
I am here to cooperate with you and follow your arrangements.

39
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:54,739
The premise of this matter is like this.

40
00:02:55,340 --> 00:02:59,259
I've been lying to my mother for a long time.

41
00:02:59,259 --> 00:03:02,359
I always wanted to end this lie.

42
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:05,459
But I don't know how it came to this point.

43
00:03:05,459 --> 00:03:10,020
But I don't think we can go on like this forever.

44
00:03:10,020 --> 00:03:11,359
I know.

45
00:03:11,359 --> 00:03:14,780
So, please help me end it.

46
00:03:14,780 --> 00:03:17,420
Today, please leave a bad impression for my mom,

47
00:03:17,420 --> 00:03:21,260
so that I can talk to her about our breakup later.

48
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:25,859
Your mom is satisfied with me, isn't she?

49
00:03:25,859 --> 00:03:28,999
My mom thinks you look handsome.

50
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,879
But she doesn't really know you.

51
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:34,270
After getting to know me, what if she is more satisfied with me?

52
00:03:40,839 --> 00:03:43,040
Am I right?

53
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:44,959
Yes.

54
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:47,039
She will think I'm not good enough.

55
00:03:47,039 --> 00:03:50,550
So, we have to do it the other way.

56
00:03:50,550 --> 00:03:52,279
The other way?

57
00:03:52,939 --> 00:03:55,990
Then, President Ye, tell me your plan.

58
00:03:59,060 --> 00:04:03,019
For example, you can dress up in a sloppy way.

59
00:04:05,780 --> 00:04:07,198
Will you drive later?

60
00:04:07,199 --> 00:04:08,259
Yes.

61
00:04:08,259 --> 00:04:11,459
You can tell my mom that you borrowed the car from a friend.

62
00:04:11,459 --> 00:04:13,550
She does not like vain people.

63
00:04:14,939 --> 00:04:15,959
Go on.

64
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:20,518
You can arrive half an hour later than the appointed time,

65
00:04:20,519 --> 00:04:22,120
and let my mom wait for you.

66
00:04:23,340 --> 00:04:25,979
Aren't you being too filial?

67
00:04:25,979 --> 00:04:29,079
This situation is special.

68
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:36,879
If my mom asks you to order, then order what I don't like.

69
00:04:36,879 --> 00:04:40,350
Like onions, bitter gourd, and cilantro…

70
00:04:58,380 --> 00:05:01,679
That's all I can think of for now.

71
00:05:01,679 --> 00:05:03,079
Enough.

72
00:05:03,079 --> 00:05:05,499
My image is almost ruined.

73
00:05:06,739 --> 00:05:08,279
To avoid being exposed,

74
00:05:08,279 --> 00:05:10,900
I have a few questions to confirm with you.

75
00:05:10,900 --> 00:05:12,680
Say it.

76
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:15,159
How long did you tell your mom that we've been dating?

77
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:16,100
10 months.

78
00:05:16,100 --> 00:05:17,398
What is my occupation?

79
00:05:17,399 --> 00:05:18,320
Doctor.

80
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:20,758
- A doctor at Anxing Hospital?
- Yes.

81
00:05:21,450 --> 00:05:23,790
Why did you make it up at that time?

82
00:05:24,340 --> 00:05:27,719
I just said it casually.

83
00:05:30,139 --> 00:05:33,579
I'm busy at work, so it's more credible to say

84
00:05:33,579 --> 00:05:35,660
you're my colleague.

85
00:05:38,380 --> 00:05:40,319
Do we need to be more realistic

86
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:41,739
when we pretend to be a couple?

87
00:05:41,739 --> 00:05:42,940
Yes.

88
00:05:42,940 --> 00:05:44,990
We can't let my mom suspect our relationship.

89
00:05:45,980 --> 00:05:46,999
We should be real.

90
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:50,279
We've been together for 10 months.

91
00:05:50,279 --> 00:05:52,200
I don't know anything about your family.

92
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:54,440
Is there anything you have to tell me?

93
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,680
My father died a long time ago.

94
00:06:06,820 --> 00:06:10,220
My mother and Uncle Xie remarried,

95
00:06:10,220 --> 00:06:12,200
and gave birth to a younger brother,

96
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:14,510
who will be taking middle school exams.

97
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:17,380
That's all you need to know.

98
00:06:17,380 --> 00:06:19,759
No need to talk too much to her.

99
00:06:26,739 --> 00:06:29,499
Okay, President Ye.

100
00:06:34,579 --> 00:06:38,579
<i>Yezi, did Lu Zhaoxi agree to your unreasonable demands?</i>

101
00:06:39,979 --> 00:06:41,340
<i>Contrary to what you predicted.</i>

102
00:06:41,340 --> 00:06:42,518
<i>He agreed to all of them.</i>

103
00:06:42,519 --> 00:06:44,739
<i>You owe me a big meal.</i>

104
00:06:45,839 --> 00:06:48,479
<i>A big meal proves that Lu Zhaoxi really loves you,</i>

105
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:50,019
<i>it's worth it.</i>

106
00:06:51,410 --> 00:06:52,619
<i>You're as expected of a writer,</i>

107
00:06:52,620 --> 00:06:55,110
<i>saying both positive and negative sides.</i>

108
00:07:21,839 --> 00:07:23,479
Welcome.

109
00:07:23,479 --> 00:07:25,079
President Gao.

110
00:07:25,079 --> 00:07:27,379
Assistant Lin, what a coincidence.

111
00:07:27,379 --> 00:07:28,940
I live close to this cafe.

112
00:07:28,940 --> 00:07:31,720
Why are you near the hospital on the weekend?

113
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:33,278
I am familiar with the neighborhood,

114
00:07:33,300 --> 00:07:35,800
so I'm meeting two friends for a chat on the second floor.

115
00:07:35,839 --> 00:07:37,838
Are you waiting for someone?

116
00:07:37,839 --> 00:07:42,159
No. I came to the coffee shop to read. Personal leisure time.

117
00:07:42,159 --> 00:07:44,000
It's good to read.

118
00:07:45,079 --> 00:07:47,299
Our president is a good man.

119
00:07:47,299 --> 00:07:50,479
He's young, brave, and resourceful.

120
00:07:50,479 --> 00:07:52,680
Yes.

121
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:57,219
After dealing with Chief Huang, what new things is he up to now?

122
00:07:57,220 --> 00:07:59,890
I haven't received any instructions yet.

123
00:08:01,259 --> 00:08:03,720
You follow him every day,

124
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:06,139
does he have any opinion of me?

125
00:08:06,139 --> 00:08:07,880
President Gao really knows how to joke.

126
00:08:07,880 --> 00:08:09,479
You're a veteran of the hospital.

127
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:11,240
He thinks highly of you.

128
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:12,876
I'm not a veteran.

129
00:08:12,876 --> 00:08:16,039
I've been in the hospital for a long time, so I'm just a senior.

130
00:08:16,039 --> 00:08:17,989
I'm getting old, sometimes I can't

131
00:08:17,990 --> 00:08:19,980
keep up with you young people.

132
00:08:19,980 --> 00:08:22,619
I'm worried that he has something against me,

133
00:08:22,619 --> 00:08:25,079
but he's too embarrassed to tell me.

134
00:08:25,079 --> 00:08:26,099
I understand.

135
00:08:26,099 --> 00:08:29,579
If there are really signs of this, I will remind you.

136
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:32,879
- Then I won't bother you.
- Go ahead, please.

137
00:08:34,239 --> 00:08:36,600
I have two friends from the pharmaceutical company on the second floor.

138
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:38,370
Do you want to go up and meet them?

139
00:08:38,370 --> 00:08:39,890
All right.

140
00:08:52,679 --> 00:08:54,479
Should I be sloppy?

141
00:09:06,599 --> 00:09:09,119
Auntie, hello.

142
00:09:25,900 --> 00:09:28,399
Auntie, hello.

143
00:09:45,640 --> 00:09:47,939
Auntie, good afternoon.

144
00:09:52,840 --> 00:09:55,080
Why should I listen to you?

145
00:09:56,400 --> 00:09:59,219
<i>How long did you tell your mom that we've been dating?</i>

146
00:09:59,219 --> 00:10:00,760
<i>10 months.</i>

147
00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:02,250
<i>What is my occupation?</i>

148
00:10:02,250 --> 00:10:03,340
<i>Doctor.</i>

149
00:10:03,340 --> 00:10:05,038
<i>A doctor at Anxing Hospital?</i>

150
00:10:05,039 --> 00:10:06,359
<i>Yes.</i>

151
00:10:11,900 --> 00:10:14,200
<i>I heard that Ye Shilan has been secretly in love with a doctor</i>

152
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:15,989
<i>named Jiang Huaiming in their department.</i>

153
00:10:15,989 --> 00:10:17,459
<i>They came here at the same time.</i>

154
00:10:17,459 --> 00:10:20,759
<i>Because she failed to confess, she applied to to go to Taoyuan Village.</i>

155
00:10:20,759 --> 00:10:22,400
<i>One is to avoid embarrassment,</i>

156
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:24,920
<i>and the other is to heal a love wound.</i>

157
00:10:24,920 --> 00:10:27,640
<i>She didn't tell me the truth.</i>

158
00:10:27,640 --> 00:10:30,320
<i>It seems that I am Jiang Huaiming's substitute.</i>

159
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:40,759
Lanlan, I have nothing to do at the hospital.

160
00:10:40,759 --> 00:10:44,219
I want to have dinner with Lu today and go back tomorrow.

161
00:10:44,219 --> 00:10:47,379
Stay a few more days. I'll show you around.

162
00:10:47,379 --> 00:10:49,719
No. It's too much trouble for you.

163
00:10:49,719 --> 00:10:51,439
Besides, I've been here for a long time,

164
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:53,590
there's still a lot to do back there.

165
00:10:53,590 --> 00:10:57,079
All right. I'll buy you a ticket later.

166
00:10:57,079 --> 00:10:59,340
Lu should be here, right?

167
00:11:00,459 --> 00:11:02,420
I'll call him.

168
00:11:08,980 --> 00:11:10,719
Hello.

169
00:11:10,719 --> 00:11:12,879
Where are you now?

170
00:11:12,879 --> 00:11:16,519
Didn't I tell you to leave earlier?

171
00:11:19,979 --> 00:11:22,939
Are you here now?

172
00:11:44,570 --> 00:11:47,409
- Good morning, Auntie.
- Good morning.

173
00:11:47,409 --> 00:11:49,739
- Let's go.
- Okay.

174
00:11:51,499 --> 00:11:53,498
- Watch your head.
- Thank you.

Lu, are you a local?

187
00:12:47,960 --> 00:12:51,718
Yes. I grew up here, Auntie.

188
00:12:51,718 --> 00:12:53,959
What do your parents do?

189
00:12:53,960 --> 00:12:56,579
They do business here.

00:12:58,059 --> 00:13:02,879
- You're...
- Mom, don't ask for so many details.

191
00:13:06,019 --> 00:13:09,439
It's because you didn't tell Auntie more about me.

192
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:13,140
Auntie was curious about me, so she asked. Right, Auntie?

193
00:13:13,140 --> 00:13:14,719
Yes.

No.

196
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:32,519
By the way, what's wrong with your car?

197
00:13:32,519 --> 00:13:34,539
It's very clean, right?

198
00:13:34,540 --> 00:13:36,080
I had it cleaned on purpose.

199
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:37,660
I'm not talking about that.

200
00:13:37,660 --> 00:13:40,999
Auntie, my parents bought this car for me.

201
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,200
My salary is about the same as Ye Shilan's.

202
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:44,980
You don't feel carsick in this car, do you?

203
00:13:44,980 --> 00:13:46,758
No, I'm not carsick. Okay.

204
00:13:46,758 --> 00:13:48,890
I'll try to drive more steadily.

205
00:14:15,740 --> 00:14:20,299
Lu, you know this place better. Why don't you order the dishes?

206
00:14:20,299 --> 00:14:21,918
Do you have anything you can't eat?

207
00:14:21,918 --> 00:14:23,299
No.

208
00:14:23,299 --> 00:14:24,599
Okay.

209
00:14:32,359 --> 00:14:35,139

<i>Please.</i>

<i>If my mom asks you to order,</i>

212
00:14:40,559 --> 00:14:42,800
<i>then order what I don't like,</i>

213
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:46,399
<i>like onions, bitter gourd and cilantro, to make my mom feel</i>

214
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:50,000
<i>that you don't know me at all, and don't care about me at all.</i>

215
00:14:50,900 --> 00:14:52,399
Hello, we can order now.

216
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:53,680
Okay.

217
00:14:56,059 --> 00:14:58,420
Roasted fish with bitter gourd.

218
00:15:00,559 --> 00:15:02,499
It's good to clear heat.

219
00:15:02,499 --> 00:15:05,279
But I remember you hate bitter gourd. Right?

220
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:07,598
She's a little bit inflamed.

221
00:15:07,599 --> 00:15:11,190
Any other recommendations? You can try lotus seed and lily soup.

222
00:15:11,190 --> 00:15:13,538
- Okay.
- Okay.

223
00:15:13,538 --> 00:15:16,919
- And this cumin beef.
- Okay.

224
00:15:16,919 --> 00:15:19,379
- I remember it has onions in it, right?
- Yes.

225
00:15:19,379 --> 00:15:21,158
Can you replace it with garlic scapes?

226
00:15:21,159 --> 00:15:22,839
- Yes.
- Okay.

227
00:15:22,839 --> 00:15:24,618
And remove the cilantro.

228
00:15:24,618 --> 00:15:26,059
Okay.

229
00:15:27,540 --> 00:15:29,980
One more of this Li Pu taro.

230
00:15:29,980 --> 00:15:32,800
Auntie, you like taro the most. Right?

231
00:15:34,300 --> 00:15:37,399
One more ginger duck to chase away the cold.

232
00:15:37,400 --> 00:15:38,800
Okay.

233
00:15:49,840 --> 00:15:51,558
The dishes are ready. Enjoy your meal.

234
00:15:51,559 --> 00:15:53,039
Thank you.

235
00:15:53,039 --> 00:15:54,379
Here you are.

236
00:15:54,379 --> 00:15:55,319
I'll do it myself.

237
00:15:55,320 --> 00:15:56,238
It's okay.

238
00:15:56,239 --> 00:15:57,640
Thank you.

239
00:16:00,900 --> 00:16:02,760
Okay, that's enough.

240
00:16:02,760 --> 00:16:04,479
Be careful, it's hot.

241
00:16:10,540 --> 00:16:13,860
The food is really good.

242
00:16:13,860 --> 00:16:16,019
I'll bring you here more often.

243
00:16:16,919 --> 00:16:18,880
Be careful.

244
00:16:21,939 --> 00:16:24,639
Auntie, have a piece of your favorite taro.

245
00:16:24,639 --> 00:16:26,780
Okay, that's enough.

246
00:16:30,680 --> 00:16:32,999
You eat some more, too.

247
00:16:52,270 --> 00:16:54,699
- Auntie, here you are.
- Thank you.

248
00:16:55,490 --> 00:16:56,939
Here you are.

249
00:17:05,479 --> 00:17:07,580
<i>President, don't fool me.</i>

250
00:17:07,580 --> 00:17:09,680
<i>It's almost over, right?</i>

251
00:17:09,680 --> 00:17:12,200
<i>When we're done eating, you can leave.</i>

252
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:14,790
<i>If my mom asks you what your plan is, just say that</i>

253
00:17:14,790 --> 00:17:17,030
<i>you are having drinks with friends, and you'll be drinking all night,</i>

254
00:17:17,030 --> 00:17:19,660
<i>and you have to sleep at home tomorrow.</i>

255
00:17:24,119 --> 00:17:27,520
Auntie, after eating, where will you go?

256
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:29,098
Nowhere.

257
00:17:29,098 --> 00:17:31,498
Why don't I take you to the park for a stroll?

258
00:17:31,498 --> 00:17:32,738
Okay.

259
00:17:32,738 --> 00:17:34,640
Will I delay your work?

260
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:37,059
My job today is to keep you company.

261
00:17:37,059 --> 00:17:38,780
Okay.

262
00:17:40,019 --> 00:17:43,880
Baby, I'll go and pay the bill.

263
00:17:52,520 --> 00:17:55,640
Lanlan, I like Lu.

264
00:17:55,640 --> 00:17:56,940
He is really good.

265
00:17:56,940 --> 00:17:59,499
You must be good together.

266
00:18:01,739 --> 00:18:04,179
Mom, I have to go to the toilet.

267
00:18:04,179 --> 00:18:05,820
Go ahead.

268
00:18:11,139 --> 00:18:12,400
Your bill.

269
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:14,079
Thank you.

270
00:18:14,079 --> 00:18:17,160
President, come here.

271
00:18:19,359 --> 00:18:20,759
President, what are you doing?

272
00:18:20,760 --> 00:18:22,960
Didn't we have a deal?

273
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:24,439
Yes.

274
00:18:24,439 --> 00:18:27,060
But I thought about it, and it doesn't make sense.

275
00:18:27,060 --> 00:18:28,559
Why?

276
00:18:28,559 --> 00:18:32,100
If I'm such a terrible man, does it make sense to you

277
00:18:32,100 --> 00:18:34,500
to be with me for so long?

278
00:18:34,500 --> 00:18:37,760
Maybe I didn't find you bad before,

279
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:41,400
or maybe I'm indecisive. How can this not work?

280
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:44,419
If you fall in love with a bad man like me,

281
00:18:44,419 --> 00:18:48,139
that means you have poor taste. Right?

282
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:53,006
And if I'm very good, but you want to break up with me,

283
00:18:53,006 --> 00:18:56,279
that also means you have poor taste. Right?

284
00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:01,810
So, no matter how, it means you have poor taste.

285
00:19:01,810 --> 00:19:04,180
Then why should I take the extra step to ruin my image?

286
00:19:04,180 --> 00:19:06,350
It is not cost-effective at all.

287
00:19:07,580 --> 00:19:12,319
Ye Shilan, you need to be thoughtful before making a plan.

288

290
00:19:40,280 --> 00:19:43,019
<i>I'm doomed.</i>

291
00:19:43,019 --> 00:19:46,620
<i>I told you he might really like you.</i>

292
00:19:50,139 --> 00:19:51,790
<i>We're at the park now,</i>

293
00:19:51,790 --> 00:19:54,690
<i>I don't know what else he will do.</i>

294
00:19:56,379 --> 00:19:59,839
<i>Warn him to stop showing off his charm.</i>

295
00:20:10,120 --> 00:20:12,059
Hello. What would you like to order?

296
00:20:12,059 --> 00:20:13,980
What time do you get off work?

297
00:20:13,980 --> 00:20:15,060
Can I help you?

298
00:20:15,060 --> 00:20:17,010
I want to talk with you.

299
00:20:17,890 --> 00:20:20,050
We don't really know each other, do we?

can't sweeten the bitterness of Kevin's heart.

302
00:20:30,440 --> 00:20:33,799
Occasionally, he needs a glass of iced Americano

303
00:20:33,799 --> 00:20:35,680
to remind himself not to forget

304

the tragic past of those years."

The novel's name: "President is too Annoying."

Pen name: Prime Minister Gui. It's you, right?

307
00:20:43,059 --> 00:20:44,478
Keep your voice down.

308
00:20:44,479 --> 00:20:46,820
Don't let my colleagues hear you.

309
00:20:49,599 --> 00:20:51,400
I still have half an hour.

310
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:52,958
Wait for me a little bit.

311
00:20:52,959 --> 00:20:54,239
Okay.

312
00:21:09,560 --> 00:21:11,639
The air here is really good.

313
00:21:12,270 --> 00:21:15,679
When you are free on weekends, do you often come out?

314
00:21:15,680 --> 00:21:17,598
- We are on shifts.
- Auntie…

315
00:21:17,599 --> 00:21:20,638
It's not easy for us to have time off at the same time.

316
00:21:21,300 --> 00:21:23,879
Right. I forgot about it.

317
00:21:23,879 --> 00:21:26,958
Auntie, in the future, we will try our best to get together and go out for walks

318
00:21:26,959 --> 00:21:30,020
so that our moods will also improve. Right?

319
00:21:30,020 --> 00:21:34,359
Yes. Good moods will create better feeling between one another.

320
00:21:37,139 --> 00:21:39,539
- I'm going to the toilet.
- We'll wait for you.

321
00:21:39,539 --> 00:21:41,270
No need. You can walk slowly.

322
00:21:41,270 --> 00:21:42,680
I'll catch up in a minute.

323
00:21:42,680 --> 00:21:44,010
Okay.

324
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:52,339
I figured it out.

325
00:21:52,339 --> 00:21:54,260
What?

326
00:21:54,260 --> 00:21:57,080
The difference between what you said.

327
00:21:57,080 --> 00:21:59,319
Your reflex arc is too long.

328
00:22:00,079 --> 00:22:01,700
Tell me.

329
00:22:01,700 --> 00:22:04,490
If you behave badly,

330
00:22:04,490 --> 00:22:06,789
then my mom will approve of me breaking up with you.

331
00:22:06,789 --> 00:22:09,560
Then I can end this quickly.

332
00:22:10,199 --> 00:22:12,999
If you're good, then my mom will keep trying

333
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,580
to persuade me.

334
00:22:15,580 --> 00:22:19,499
This way, the breakup will become muddy.

335
00:22:19,499 --> 00:22:21,239
That makes sense.

336
00:22:21,239 --> 00:22:22,539
So what?

337
00:22:22,539 --> 00:22:26,179
After my mom goes back, I'll probably need you

338
00:22:26,179 --> 00:22:29,439
to keep pretending to be my boyfriend remotely

339
00:22:29,439 --> 00:22:32,159
until I convince her.

340
00:22:35,079 --> 00:22:36,210
It's okay.

341
00:22:36,210 --> 00:22:37,790
I can cooperate with you.

342
00:22:39,060 --> 00:22:41,600
Why are you so nice all of a sudden?

343
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:44,480
I'm always willing to help people.

344
00:22:48,339 --> 00:22:50,360
Do you really like me?

345
00:22:58,560 --> 00:23:02,680
I don't mind if it can make you confident and beautiful.

346
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:08,200
My confidence doesn't need to be based on a man's liking.

347
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:09,618
Good point.

348
00:23:09,618 --> 00:23:13,759
Then forget about that fake doctor boyfriend of yours.

349
00:23:14,859 --> 00:23:18,180
If he's fake, then how can I forget him?

350
00:23:20,599 --> 00:23:22,660
Why aren't you walking?

351
00:23:22,660 --> 00:23:24,438
- Waiting for you, Mom.
- We're waiting for you.

352
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:27,760
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

353
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:49,039
It's your time off now?

354
00:23:49,780 --> 00:23:52,300
What do you want from me?

355
00:23:52,300 --> 00:23:54,710
Don't you want to explain it?

356
00:23:54,710 --> 00:23:55,939
Explain what?

357
00:23:55,939 --> 00:23:59,100
A man who carries a strawberry smoothie in a thermos.

358
00:23:59,100 --> 00:24:01,820
A man who carries a band-aid with him.

359
00:24:01,820 --> 00:24:03,740
If these all are coincidences,

360
00:24:03,740 --> 00:24:06,880
then I ordered an iced Americano before,

361
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:08,338
you also wrote it in your novel.

362
00:24:08,338 --> 00:24:10,618
- You did that on purpose?
- Great.

363
00:24:10,618 --> 00:24:12,999
You admit that you take your customer's habits

364
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:15,539
as materials for your own writing.

365
00:24:15,539 --> 00:24:17,198
Art comes from life.

366
00:24:17,199 --> 00:24:19,019
I find inspiration in life.

367
00:24:19,019 --> 00:24:21,060
Any problem?

368
00:24:21,060 --> 00:24:22,779
It's no problem.

369
00:24:22,779 --> 00:24:25,198
But there is a problem if you focus on one person to write about.

370
00:24:25,199 --> 00:24:26,639
I didn't write your name.

371
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:28,960
My English name is also Kevin.

372
00:24:33,599 --> 00:24:35,039
It's just a coincidence.

373
00:24:35,040 --> 00:24:36,700
I didn't know your name before.

374
00:24:36,700 --> 00:24:38,490
But I know your name.

375
00:24:38,490 --> 00:24:41,330
Your colleagues call you Yao Jiajia, right?

376
00:24:41,330 --> 00:24:43,260
Your pen name is Prime Minister Gui.

377
00:24:43,260 --> 00:24:46,720
So it should be Jia as in Jiaren.

378
00:24:48,199 --> 00:24:50,399
What do you want to do?

379
00:24:50,399 --> 00:24:51,780
I want you to change the story.

380
00:24:51,780 --> 00:24:53,760
Change the story?

381
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:55,099
No way.

382
00:24:55,099 --> 00:24:56,379
Just don't read it.

383
00:24:56,379 --> 00:24:58,078
It doesn't affect your life.

384
00:24:58,079 --> 00:24:59,420
It does.

385
00:24:59,420 --> 00:25:00,960
How could it?

386
00:25:02,100 --> 00:25:04,039
My friend is a regular reader of yours.

387
00:25:04,040 --> 00:25:05,718
He reminded me that this villain

388
00:25:05,719 --> 00:25:07,799
is very similar to my characteristics.

389
00:25:07,800 --> 00:25:09,339
That's why I read it.

390
00:25:09,339 --> 00:25:11,500
Then I found you.

391
00:25:11,500 --> 00:25:15,000
No wonder as a big man, you like reading such novels.

392
00:25:19,119 --> 00:25:22,400
So? How does it affect your life?

393
00:25:25,940 --> 00:25:28,280
The role is currently double-sided.

394
00:25:28,280 --> 00:25:30,279
According to the current story trend,

395
00:25:30,280 --> 00:25:33,100
he will betray the hero eventually.

396
00:25:33,100 --> 00:25:34,860
My friend finds it awkward,

397
00:25:34,860 --> 00:25:38,499
which also directly affects my image in his mind.

398
00:25:38,499 --> 00:25:40,480
Is it funny?

399
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:41,939
No.

400
00:25:41,939 --> 00:25:45,180
If it's true, then tell him not to read it.

401
00:25:45,180 --> 00:25:47,439
Because of your continuous updates during the past three years,

402
00:25:47,439 --> 00:25:49,790
he has been following your novel.

403
00:25:50,590 --> 00:25:53,200
Do you care so little about your fans?

404
00:25:55,180 --> 00:25:58,119
Your friend's imagination is really rich.

405
00:25:59,060 --> 00:26:01,230
Your friend is a woman, right?

406
00:26:01,920 --> 00:26:03,318
Why do you say so?

407
00:26:03,319 --> 00:26:06,180
You care so much about your image in her mind.

408
00:26:06,180 --> 00:26:08,040
You have a crush on her.

409
00:26:09,920 --> 00:26:11,519
You're right.

410
00:26:12,239 --> 00:26:14,680
So can you please change the storyline?

411
00:26:16,060 --> 00:26:18,399
How to change it?

412
00:26:18,399 --> 00:26:20,260
Reset the ambiguity.

413
00:26:20,260 --> 00:26:23,720
It turns out he's actually a good man.

414
00:26:24,739 --> 00:26:28,109
Mr. Kevin, it's easy for you to say that.

415
00:26:28,110 --> 00:26:30,619
Do you know how troublesome it is to change the storyline?

416
00:26:30,619 --> 00:26:33,700
And why should I listen to you?

417
00:26:34,920 --> 00:26:37,958
You don't seem to want your colleagues to know

418
00:26:37,959 --> 00:26:40,580
you're writing this kind of novel, do you?

419
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:44,159
It's okay.

420
00:26:46,180 --> 00:26:47,480
Waitress.

421
00:26:47,480 --> 00:26:48,900
Hello, sir.

422
00:26:54,060 --> 00:26:56,319
I'm sorry. Nothing.

423
00:26:57,400 --> 00:27:00,100
Jiajia, is this your friend?

424
00:27:00,100 --> 00:27:01,859
My friend.

425
00:27:10,079 --> 00:27:11,600
I'll try to change it.

426
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:14,890
Maybe there will be unexpected gains.

427
00:27:30,319 --> 00:27:34,700
Lu, why did you choose to be a doctor?

428
00:27:36,739 --> 00:27:38,218
I like it.

429
00:27:38,218 --> 00:27:40,700
I think the profession of a doctor is very sacred,

430
00:27:40,700 --> 00:27:42,039
which can cure and save people.

431
00:27:42,040 --> 00:27:43,599
I think it's meaningful.

432
00:27:43,599 --> 00:27:48,000
Right. No one can live without doctors in one's life.

433
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:52,239
You've not told me why you chose to study medicine.

434
00:27:54,619 --> 00:27:57,338
Lanlan is very independent.

435
00:27:57,338 --> 00:27:59,218
She decides everything by herself.

436
00:27:59,218 --> 00:28:01,739
I don't even know the reason.

437
00:28:03,730 --> 00:28:05,580
Do you want to hear the truth?

438
00:28:05,580 --> 00:28:07,080
Of course.

439
00:28:08,040 --> 00:28:10,960
Although I like being a doctor now,

440
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:12,958
I applied for this profession

441
00:28:12,959 --> 00:28:16,979
because it's easy to find a job.

442
00:28:18,130 --> 00:28:20,338
If you don't need to think about finding a job,

443
00:28:20,338 --> 00:28:22,420
what do you want to study?

444
00:28:23,739 --> 00:28:25,999
I don't know.

445
00:28:25,999 --> 00:28:29,498
At that time, I had classes and part-time jobs,

446
00:28:29,498 --> 00:28:32,200
so I rarely thought about what I was interested in.

447
00:28:32,200 --> 00:28:33,970
I didn't know much about it either.

448
00:28:37,680 --> 00:28:40,300
What was your hobby when you were a kid?

449
00:28:40,300 --> 00:28:43,699
Lanlan likes painting, right?

450
00:28:43,699 --> 00:28:45,300
Painting is good.

451
00:28:45,300 --> 00:28:47,059
Just painting randomly.

452
00:28:47,059 --> 00:28:48,399
I forgot that.

453
00:28:48,400 --> 00:28:50,420
I remember it clearly.

454
00:28:50,420 --> 00:28:53,838
I remember that once she went to the rooftop to paint,

455
00:28:53,839 --> 00:28:58,280
and accidentally got the paint on someone else's clothes that were outside drying.

456
00:28:58,280 --> 00:29:01,926
She came back sullen, afraid to tell me,

457
00:29:01,926 --> 00:29:03,830
afraid to lose money.

458
00:29:03,830 --> 00:29:06,219
Her father came home at night,

459
00:29:06,219 --> 00:29:08,279
and saw that she was strange, so he asked her.

460
00:29:08,280 --> 00:29:11,460
Then she suddenly cried loudly,

461
00:29:11,460 --> 00:29:14,200
scaring me and her father.

462
00:29:14,200 --> 00:29:17,779
Then her father took her from house to house to ask.

463
00:29:17,779 --> 00:29:20,300
Finally, they found the owner of the clothes.

464
00:29:20,300 --> 00:29:22,359
They were very nice, saying it was okay and

465
00:29:22,360 --> 00:29:23,759
we didn't need to compensate.

466
00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:27,718
Her father insisted on a symbolic compensation of one yuan.

467
00:29:27,719 --> 00:29:30,820
He said he wanted to make Lanlan know she was wrong,

468
00:29:30,820 --> 00:29:33,739
so she would feel better.

469
00:29:33,739 --> 00:29:36,459
Uncle's approach is really good.

470
00:29:36,459 --> 00:29:40,259
Her father, although didn't read much, knew a lot.

471
00:29:40,259 --> 00:29:42,620
And he was righteous.

472
00:29:42,620 --> 00:29:45,560
Lanlan was most influenced by him.

473
00:29:49,199 --> 00:29:51,339
If only her father were still alive.

474
00:29:51,339 --> 00:29:54,338
He would be so happy to see you two like this today.

475
00:29:54,338 --> 00:29:57,219
Mom, don't talk about this.

476
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:02,620
Have you rested enough?

477
00:30:02,620 --> 00:30:04,430
Let's go for a walk.

478
00:30:09,560 --> 00:30:10,960
Go for a walk.

479
00:30:20,360 --> 00:30:22,958
Lanlan, lend me your phone.

480
00:30:22,959 --> 00:30:25,820
Let me take some pictures of you.

481
00:30:25,820 --> 00:30:27,819
No need.

482
00:30:27,819 --> 00:30:29,118
Take some.

483
00:30:29,119 --> 00:30:31,999
I want to show your Uncle Xie.

484
00:30:31,999 --> 00:30:33,540
My phone is out of battery.

485
00:30:33,540 --> 00:30:35,580
I'll take some and send them to you later.

486
00:30:35,580 --> 00:30:37,459
My phone is not good at taking pictures.

487
00:30:37,459 --> 00:30:39,560
- Otherwise I...
- Auntie, use my phone.

488
00:30:39,560 --> 00:30:41,699
Okay.

489
00:30:41,699 --> 00:30:43,199
I unlocked it for you.

490
00:30:43,199 --> 00:30:44,519
Okay.

491
00:30:44,519 --> 00:30:45,900
- In this way, right?
- Yes.

492
00:30:45,900 --> 00:30:47,179
Okay.

493
00:30:47,179 --> 00:30:49,158
Here is beautiful. Stand here.

494
00:30:49,158 --> 00:30:52,278
Come on, Lanlan. Lu, come on, stand there.

495
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:54,600
Stand well.

496
00:30:59,060 --> 00:31:01,840
Lanlan, you look good when you smile.

497
00:31:02,599 --> 00:31:03,900
Come on.

498
00:31:07,400 --> 00:31:10,520
Good. Smile.

499
00:31:15,730 --> 00:31:17,700
Don't you learn from others?

500
00:31:19,800 --> 00:31:21,799
It's not appropriate.

501
00:31:21,799 --> 00:31:24,419
You said you wanted to be real,

502
00:31:24,419 --> 00:31:26,700
but now you are a wimp.

503
00:31:26,700 --> 00:31:28,600
I am not.

504
00:31:30,419 --> 00:31:33,539
That's not good. Let's take another one.

505
00:31:34,560 --> 00:31:35,819
That's good.

506
00:31:35,819 --> 00:31:37,198
Keep it up.

507
00:31:37,199 --> 00:31:39,540
Smile.

508
00:31:41,560 --> 00:31:43,238
You two hold hands and walk forward.

509
00:31:43,239 --> 00:31:45,360
I'll take some pictures of you.

510
00:31:46,180 --> 00:31:47,560
Let's go.

511
00:31:49,520 --> 00:31:51,660
Look at me.

512
00:31:57,680 --> 00:31:59,139
Don't feel burdened.

513
00:31:59,139 --> 00:32:03,119
I'm already prepared to be taken advantage of by you.

514
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:06,739
That's a big sacrifice for you.

515
00:32:07,739 --> 00:32:11,239
I bragged that I would be responsible for you.

516
00:32:11,239 --> 00:32:13,399
I don't mean that.

517
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:15,759
Turn around.

518
00:32:16,560 --> 00:32:18,979
Okay. Great.

519
00:32:18,979 --> 00:32:21,339
Keep going.

520
00:32:21,339 --> 00:32:22,659
It's so good.

521
00:32:22,659 --> 00:32:26,059
I want to show you and your mom an example.

522
00:32:26,059 --> 00:32:27,438
After all, I'm the one who did it.

523
00:32:27,439 --> 00:32:29,378
Then you have to find a boyfriend according to me,

524
00:32:29,378 --> 00:32:30,940
not worse than me.

525
00:32:30,940 --> 00:32:34,519
This is also responsible for your life event, right?

526
00:32:35,979 --> 00:32:37,999
To find one better than you.

527
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:40,700
Then I will not be able to find a boyfriend.

528
00:32:41,599 --> 00:32:43,519
That's true.

529
00:32:45,139 --> 00:32:50,739
President, did you soak your face in medicinal wine?

530
00:32:50,739 --> 00:32:52,980
I can't find a girlfriend anyway.

531
00:32:52,980 --> 00:32:54,790
We're in the same boat.

532
00:32:56,940 --> 00:32:59,019
My mom is on the phone.

533
00:32:59,580 --> 00:33:02,238
It's okay. Let's wait for her.

534
00:33:13,520 --> 00:33:14,960
Your...

535
00:33:15,860 --> 00:33:17,338
Is your mother good at taking pictures?

536
00:33:17,338 --> 00:33:18,978
She is fine with vegetables.

537
00:33:18,978 --> 00:33:20,499
Vegetables?

538
00:33:20,499 --> 00:33:22,820
My mom and Uncle Xie sell vegetables in the market.

539
00:33:22,820 --> 00:33:25,238
Sometimes, she takes pictures for customers

540
00:33:25,239 --> 00:33:26,840
for home delivery.

541
00:33:27,979 --> 00:33:32,300
We don't look like two big carrots to your mother, do we?

542
00:33:32,959 --> 00:33:34,619
Don't worry about that.

543
00:33:34,619 --> 00:33:36,680
We're just pretending anyway.

544
00:33:37,379 --> 00:33:39,540
I have made so many sacrifices,

545
00:33:39,540 --> 00:33:41,679
I just want the results to be good.

546
00:33:41,679 --> 00:33:43,240
It's all your fault.

547
00:33:43,240 --> 00:33:45,860
Otherwise, it could have ended earlier.

548
00:33:45,860 --> 00:33:47,130
We're out for a walk.

549
00:33:47,130 --> 00:33:49,250
You're in a good mood, aren't you?

550
00:33:51,610 --> 00:33:53,279
Watch out for the ball.

551
00:34:10,600 --> 00:34:12,560
Brother, I'm sorry.

552
00:34:12,560 --> 00:34:14,060
It's okay. Go play.

553
00:34:14,060 --> 00:34:15,338
Okay.

554
00:34:16,479 --> 00:34:17,739
Are you okay?

555
00:34:17,739 --> 00:34:19,679
Just a little dizzy.

556
00:34:19,679 --> 00:34:20,859
What about you?

557
00:34:20,859 --> 00:34:22,859
I'm okay.

558
00:34:23,940 --> 00:34:25,999
You... You have a nosebleed.

559
00:34:26,910 --> 00:34:29,550
- What's with the nosebleed? Take a break over there.
- It's okay.

560
00:34:29,550 --> 00:34:31,298
Raise your arm. Raise your arm.

561
00:34:31,298 --> 00:34:33,260
Take a break over there.

562
00:34:43,980 --> 00:34:46,559
I've taken good pictures, right?

563
00:34:46,559 --> 00:34:47,939
Auntie, I've seen them all.

564
00:34:47,939 --> 00:34:50,239
Your technique is very good.

565
00:34:50,239 --> 00:34:51,980
No.

566
00:34:55,639 --> 00:34:57,359
Why did you take this?

567
00:34:57,360 --> 00:34:59,369
I... I finished answering the phone,

568
00:34:59,370 --> 00:35:02,198
seeing you chatting happily, so I took a few more shots

569
00:35:02,199 --> 00:35:03,799
by coincidence.

570
00:35:03,800 --> 00:35:05,100
It was an accident.

571
00:35:05,100 --> 00:35:07,340
He got hit in the head with a ball.

572
00:35:07,340 --> 00:35:09,779
I think it looks good.

573
00:35:10,579 --> 00:35:14,159
What? Are you embarrassed?

574
00:35:14,159 --> 00:35:16,700
I'm just clarifying it.

575
00:35:41,740 --> 00:35:43,619
- I'm going to the toilet.
- Go ahead.

576
00:35:43,619 --> 00:35:45,760
Hello, sir. Add 92 or 95?

577
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:47,378
- Fill it up with 95.
- Okay, wait a minute.

578
00:35:47,378 --> 00:35:48,779
Thank you.

579
00:35:51,579 --> 00:35:54,420
Lu, I'm very happy today.

580
00:35:54,420 --> 00:35:56,160
Thank you.

581
00:35:56,160 --> 00:35:57,459
Auntie, you're so polite.

582
00:35:57,459 --> 00:35:59,130
I didn't do anything.

583
00:35:59,130 --> 00:36:02,899
I am happy that you are good to Lanlan.

584
00:36:02,899 --> 00:36:04,759
Tell you the truth.

585
00:36:04,760 --> 00:36:08,900
In fact, before today, I was quite worried.

586
00:36:12,460 --> 00:36:15,460
Auntie, what are you worried about?

587
00:36:16,980 --> 00:36:20,379
Did Lanlan tell you about our family situation?

588
00:36:21,180 --> 00:36:22,719
Yes.

589
00:36:23,460 --> 00:36:26,079
Our family is poor.

590
00:36:26,079 --> 00:36:28,960
Lanlan was very sensible when she was young.

591
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:31,618
Two years after her father died,

592
00:36:31,618 --> 00:36:34,500
she went to boarding school when she was in junior high school.

593
00:36:34,500 --> 00:36:38,320
In fact, we spent very little time together.

594
00:36:38,320 --> 00:36:40,280
I read on the internet

595
00:36:40,280 --> 00:36:43,870
that girls who lack family care

596
00:36:43,879 --> 00:36:48,460
are prone to meet bad men, and are deceived by sweet words.

597
00:36:48,460 --> 00:36:52,158
As a mother, in fact, sometimes I think about it,

598
00:36:52,159 --> 00:36:54,619
worrying about Lanlan being hurt.

599
00:36:54,619 --> 00:36:58,850
She is very considerate, and is afraid of me worrying.

600
00:36:58,850 --> 00:37:03,040
So if she has any problems, she won't say anything to me.

601
00:37:03,040 --> 00:37:06,220
Auntie, you don't have to worry about that.

602
00:37:06,220 --> 00:37:08,900
I think Ye Shilan is independent, self-loving,

603
00:37:08,900 --> 00:37:13,119
honest, kind, and strong-minded.

604
00:37:13,119 --> 00:37:16,299
Yes, right. She is very much like her father.

605
00:37:18,560 --> 00:37:22,419
When Uncle died, she must have been very sad.

606
00:37:22,419 --> 00:37:24,560
After all, she was so young.

607
00:37:25,320 --> 00:37:26,779
Yes.

608
00:37:28,579 --> 00:37:30,679
How should I put it?

609
00:37:30,679 --> 00:37:34,159
She was crying so much.

610
00:37:34,159 --> 00:37:37,899
For two days, she didn't eat or sleep.

611
00:37:37,899 --> 00:37:40,260
She fell asleep because she was too tired.

612
00:37:41,850 --> 00:37:43,398
After she woke up, she kept asking me.

613
00:37:43,399 --> 00:37:46,719
She said, "Mom, am I having a nightmare?"

614
00:37:48,779 --> 00:37:51,039
It was really hard for her to accept it.

615
00:37:51,700 --> 00:37:54,439
I can't stand it, let alone her.

616
00:37:55,099 --> 00:37:58,958
She couldn't accept the fact that her father committed suicide.

617
00:38:00,199 --> 00:38:03,500
Uncle committed suicide?

618
00:38:04,280 --> 00:38:07,358
- You...
- Lanlan did not tell you?

619
00:38:09,399 --> 00:38:11,160
She never said this.

620
00:38:12,719 --> 00:38:17,460
I can see that she is still very angry with her father.

621
00:38:17,460 --> 00:38:19,520
If she didn't tell you this,

622
00:38:19,520 --> 00:38:22,199
please pretend that I didn't tell you. Okay?

623
00:38:24,859 --> 00:38:27,660
Auntie, don't worry.

624
00:38:29,559 --> 00:38:31,700
It's a thing of the past.

625
00:38:31,700 --> 00:38:33,860
I can see you are so good today.

626
00:38:33,860 --> 00:38:36,299
And you're so considerate to Lanlan.

627
00:38:36,299 --> 00:38:38,058
And you have such a good relationship.

628
00:38:38,058 --> 00:38:41,519
I see her always smiling when she's with you.

629
00:38:41,519 --> 00:38:44,780
I am finally relieved.

630
00:38:49,320 --> 00:38:51,620
What did you talk about?

631
00:38:51,620 --> 00:38:55,619
I said that you are too straightforward and easily offend people.

632
00:38:55,619 --> 00:38:59,818
So I told Lu to remind you and be more tolerant of you.

633
00:38:59,818 --> 00:39:01,599
Auntie, don't say that.

634
00:39:01,600 --> 00:39:03,420
I also did a lot of bad things.

635
00:39:03,420 --> 00:39:06,299
Ye Shilan is tolerant of me.

636
00:39:06,299 --> 00:39:07,759
It's good for two people

637
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:11,299
to understand and tolerate each other.

638
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:15,958
Sir, your card.

639
00:39:15,959 --> 00:39:18,080
- Thank you.
- Please drive safely.

640
00:39:33,859 --> 00:39:36,020
It's hard to change the draft, right?

641
00:39:37,379 --> 00:39:38,780
Yes.

642
00:39:38,780 --> 00:39:40,939
Though I didn't finish too many chapters,

643
00:39:40,939 --> 00:39:42,900
but one part affects the whole.

644
00:39:42,900 --> 00:39:44,718
In addition to adjusting the previous plots,

645
00:39:44,719 --> 00:39:47,770
I have to rewrite the following chapters.

646
00:39:47,770 --> 00:39:49,400
To update without interruption,

647
00:39:49,400 --> 00:39:52,080
I took three days off.

648
00:39:52,940 --> 00:39:54,939
What a coincidence!

649
00:39:54,939 --> 00:39:57,739
You ran into the living material friend,

650
00:39:57,740 --> 00:39:59,719
and he has the same name.

651
00:39:59,719 --> 00:40:01,100
Bad luck.

652
00:40:01,100 --> 00:40:03,378
It's so speechless for them to share the same name.

653
00:40:03,378 --> 00:40:05,599
There are a lot of people named Kevin.

654
00:40:05,600 --> 00:40:08,559
He said I ruined his image in the mind of his crush.

655
00:40:08,560 --> 00:40:12,380
My villain is obviously very attractive. Okay?

656
00:40:12,380 --> 00:40:14,339
And his image is not bad.

657
00:40:14,339 --> 00:40:15,878
I don't know why he did that.

658
00:40:15,879 --> 00:40:17,540
His image is not bad.

659
00:40:17,540 --> 00:40:21,160
Then this Kevin is very handsome?

660
00:40:21,160 --> 00:40:22,319
Not bad.

661
00:40:22,320 --> 00:40:24,199
Then he's very handsome.

662
00:40:24,199 --> 00:40:26,259
With your attitude to him now,

663
00:40:26,259 --> 00:40:29,100
his rank is higher at least two levels.

664
00:40:29,100 --> 00:40:31,229
You must have subconsciously thought he was very handsome,

665
00:40:31,229 --> 00:40:33,390
so you wrote him in your novel.

666
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:38,058
A cute guy in contrast, plus an optimistic little writer,

667
00:40:38,058 --> 00:40:39,710
don't you think they're a great couple?

668
00:40:39,710 --> 00:40:42,499
Yezi, you learned bad tricks from Lu Zhaoxi.

669
00:40:42,499 --> 00:40:44,638
I'm so miserable, and you still bully me.

670
00:40:44,639 --> 00:40:46,299
I'm wrong.

671
00:40:47,940 --> 00:40:50,299
Feeling better now?

672
00:40:51,779 --> 00:40:53,740
What will be, will be.

673
00:40:53,740 --> 00:40:55,500
The villain wants to mend his ways.

674
00:40:55,500 --> 00:40:57,300
I have to accept it.

675
00:40:58,280 --> 00:41:00,380
Is there anything I can do for you?

676
00:41:00,380 --> 00:41:03,760
I feel bitter, and want to ship a couple.

677
00:41:05,859 --> 00:41:07,406
Okay.

678
00:41:08,220 --> 00:41:11,086
I will satisfy you today.

679
00:41:11,086 --> 00:41:13,180
What do you want to hear?

680
00:41:13,180 --> 00:41:15,798
- Something exciting.
- Something exciting?

681
00:41:22,801 --> 00:41:25,319
Don't do that. It's just the two of us in this room.

682
00:41:25,320 --> 00:41:26,539
Do you want to hear it or not?

683
00:41:26,539 --> 00:41:28,600
Yes.

684
00:41:28,600 --> 00:41:29,920
Come here.

685
00:41:35,339 --> 00:41:37,320
You kissed?

686
