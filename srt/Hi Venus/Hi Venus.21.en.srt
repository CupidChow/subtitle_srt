16
00:01:33,130 --> 00:01:35,090
Didn't you two make it public?

17
00:01:35,090 --> 00:01:37,360
Why don't you dine together?

18
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:40,850
The two of us agreed not to interact too often in front of everyone.

19
00:01:40,850 --> 00:01:43,140
It will attract attention.

20
00:01:44,810 --> 00:01:48,898
Why are you so cautious? Did you hear any rumors?

21
00:01:48,898 --> 00:01:53,680
I don't care about rumors, but Ye Shilan cares.

22
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:58,099
There's hearsay that I'm a playboy and am just playing with her emotions.

23
00:01:58,099 --> 00:01:59,729
Did you only learn that?

24
00:01:59,729 --> 00:02:02,420
What do you mean? What else is there?

25
00:02:02,420 --> 00:02:04,560
I heard another version.

26
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:08,960
It's said that Ye Shilan is a cunning and vain woman.

27
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:14,480
She wants to change her class by flattering and entangling you.

28
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:15,729
Have they gone so far?

29
00:02:15,729 --> 00:02:18,338
Yes. Much more than that.

30
00:02:18,338 --> 00:02:21,560
I'm afraid she already anticipated these remarks

31
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:24,040
so she doesn't want to come out into the open.

32
00:02:29,100 --> 00:02:32,220
<i>I promise. It must be true...</i>

33
00:02:43,839 --> 00:02:45,960
Did I think too much?

34
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:49,120
But were they discussing me?

35
00:02:49,559 --> 00:02:51,620
Probably.

36
00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:56,300
Did you hear any other rumors?

37
00:02:56,300 --> 00:02:59,200
As we're so close now,

38
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:01,820
I'm afraid no one will talk with me.

Yes. And I decided to accompany you here.

Please help me check it. To find anything improper.

Don't put so much pressure on yourself.

No. Just us. No men.

I want to ask you something.

148
00:10:54,138 --> 00:10:57,758
Is President Gao presiding over the mobilization meeting for medical assistance?

149
00:10:57,758 --> 00:10:58,619
Yes.

150
00:10:58,619 --> 00:11:00,940
When was it settled?

151
00:11:00,940 --> 00:11:04,139
About a week ago. What's going on?

152
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:10,360
Then it was a temporary behavior for him to ask Ye Shilan to speak.

153
00:11:10,860 --> 00:11:14,240
Does Dr. Ye want to give the speech?

154
00:11:14,980 --> 00:11:16,820
I didn't think too much.

155
00:11:16,820 --> 00:11:19,740
However, relating to all these rumors,

156
00:11:19,740 --> 00:11:21,540
I still think it's so weird.

157
00:11:21,540 --> 00:11:23,520
For example?

158
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:25,979
It's quite different this time.

159
00:11:25,979 --> 00:11:31,659
Just like someone is trying to stir up rumors and troubles maliciously.

160
00:11:31,659 --> 00:11:33,860
Do you suspect President Gao?

161
00:11:34,660 --> 00:11:39,099
He knows Ye Shilan is my girlfriend but still asks her to give a speech.

162
00:11:39,099 --> 00:11:42,100
Does he want rumors to spread even more?

163
00:11:42,100 --> 00:11:44,018
Besides, I don't know his intention.

164
00:11:44,018 --> 00:11:46,660
Why does he try to disgust me?

165
00:11:46,660 --> 00:11:48,920
What benefit can he get?

166
00:11:49,459 --> 00:11:54,060
If he really is doing this, I'm sure he'll do something else.

167
00:11:54,060 --> 00:11:57,440
I'll pay attention to his motivation.

168
00:11:58,710 --> 00:12:00,980
That's what we can do now.

169
00:12:03,699 --> 00:12:07,419
That's what I've learned from my experience in Taoyuan Village.

170
00:12:07,419 --> 00:12:11,659
If there's another chance, I'll continue this kind of public benefit activity.

171
00:12:11,659 --> 00:12:13,660
Thank you so much.

172
00:12:18,540 --> 00:12:20,458
Thank you Dr Ye for sharing.

173
00:12:20,458 --> 00:12:24,740
Our hospital's medical assistance program takes about three months as a cycle.

174
00:12:24,740 --> 00:12:28,820
As she's stayed for over six months,

175
00:12:28,820 --> 00:12:31,040
she's well-experienced.

176
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:35,620
If you have any questions, you can come and ask her.

177
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:41,180
Dr. Ye, there are few recreations in the village

178
00:12:41,180 --> 00:12:44,960
so did you feel bored in your spare time?

179
00:12:44,960 --> 00:12:48,140
I'm a homebody myself so I felt okay with it.

180
00:12:48,140 --> 00:12:50,639
If you feel bored, you can choose to

181
00:12:50,640 --> 00:12:53,238
listen to music, watch TV, read books or play games.

182
00:12:53,238 --> 00:12:57,960
Actually, time flew and I always felt sleepy in the evening.

183
00:13:00,420 --> 00:13:03,040
Dr. Ye, what about the food there?

184
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:05,179
The variety is definitely not as many as in the city.

185
00:13:05,179 --> 00:13:07,058
Just some home-cooked dishes.

186
00:13:07,058 --> 00:13:10,458
But the food is green and pollution-free.

187
00:13:10,458 --> 00:13:13,360
Maybe I can lose weight there.

188
00:13:17,780 --> 00:13:20,400
Dr. Ye, can I ask a personal question?

189
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:22,260
Go ahead.

190
00:13:22,260 --> 00:13:25,420
We heard you met the President in Taoyuan Village.

191
00:13:25,420 --> 00:13:29,280
Can you tell us what happened at that time?

192
00:13:32,059 --> 00:13:35,100
He's now sitting behind you.

193
00:13:37,159 --> 00:13:38,920
Talk about it in private.

194
00:13:38,920 --> 00:13:43,199
President, do you want to say anything to them?

195
00:13:43,199 --> 00:13:44,960
Okay.

196
00:13:45,940 --> 00:13:47,560
President.

197
00:13:50,710 --> 00:13:52,360
Thank you.

198
00:13:56,919 --> 00:13:58,720
What's going on?

199
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:01,660
Weren't you quite happy?

200
00:14:02,420 --> 00:14:05,240
Why are you so quiet when I'm here?

201
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:07,500
Am I so horrible?

202
00:14:10,699 --> 00:14:14,740
I know you're all interested.

203
00:14:14,740 --> 00:14:18,600
As one of the parties, do you want to know my answer?

204
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:21,639
<i>- Yes!
- Yes!</i>

205
00:14:22,960 --> 00:14:26,899
Fine. As time is limited, I'll tell you something briefly.

206
00:14:26,899 --> 00:14:30,049
I was driving in the mountains and then met a mishap.

207
00:14:30,049 --> 00:14:32,518
Then I walked to Taoyuan Village Clinic by chance.

208
00:14:32,518 --> 00:14:36,220
I had no money and Dr. Ye took me in.

209
00:14:36,220 --> 00:14:38,620
There was no signal at that time.

210
00:14:38,620 --> 00:14:42,109
I told her I was the new president but she didn't believe

211
00:14:42,110 --> 00:14:44,560
and insisted I was a fake medicinal liquor seller.

212
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:48,899
I had no way to prove myself so we had some misunderstandings.

213
00:14:48,899 --> 00:14:51,640
When I came back, I found that

214
00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:54,300
I was still missing her.

215
00:14:55,640 --> 00:14:58,600
Maybe I fell in love with her at first sight.

216
00:15:01,039 --> 00:15:04,580
But it was only later that I found out that I fell in love with Dr. Ye.

217
00:15:04,580 --> 00:15:08,620
So I had the cheek to try every means to pursue her.

218
00:15:08,620 --> 00:15:13,000
To be honest, it was hard for me to chase her.

219
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,659
We're now together.

220
00:15:14,659 --> 00:15:21,480
Although we are together now, Dr. Ye is relatively low-key so please give her a little space here.

221
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:23,519
I don't want her to be frightened off, okay?

222
00:15:23,520 --> 00:15:25,800
<i>Okay!</i>

223
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:31,818
Fine. Let's stop here for private matters.

224
00:15:31,818 --> 00:15:35,038
Though it's a mobilization meeting, I still hope you can

225
00:15:35,038 --> 00:15:38,358
act accordingly to the actual situation and do what you can.

226
00:15:38,358 --> 00:15:42,920
Of course, the hospital will also support you in various ways.

227
00:16:04,380 --> 00:16:05,640
What are you doing?

228
00:16:05,640 --> 00:16:07,860
I just want to kiss you.

229
00:16:11,340 --> 00:16:14,940
Had you decided to go to the venue to talk about this?

230
00:16:14,940 --> 00:16:16,159
You heard?

231
00:16:16,159 --> 00:16:18,280
Yes. Loud and clear.

232
00:16:18,760 --> 00:16:20,740
It was the truth.

233
00:16:20,740 --> 00:16:24,740
I did chase you and it was quite hard to chase you.

234
00:16:24,740 --> 00:16:29,300
Really? Obviously, I am not good enough for you.

235
00:16:30,420 --> 00:16:36,540
Dr. Ye, I find that your thinking in this area really should be improved.

236
00:16:36,540 --> 00:16:39,000
Yes, President.

237
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:42,460
Shall we go and play badminton after work?

238
00:16:42,460 --> 00:16:43,520
Okay.

239
00:16:43,520 --> 00:16:45,659
Then we can go out for a meal and shopping.

240
00:16:45,659 --> 00:16:46,960
What do you want to buy?

241
00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:48,660
Cosmetics.

242
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:54,280
It will be convenient for you to touch up your makeup after putting a set in my house.

243
00:16:55,880 --> 00:16:57,760
Good idea.

244
00:16:58,660 --> 00:17:03,000
I want to ask for annual leave to go back to my hometown next month.

245
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,640
Will you bring me?

246
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:10,140
I think it's better to talk to my mother face to face.

247
00:17:11,219 --> 00:17:14,700
Looks like I have to put on a good show.

248
00:17:15,460 --> 00:17:17,018
You are already fine.

249
00:17:17,018 --> 00:17:19,840
Take it easy. Don't scare her.

250
00:17:19,840 --> 00:17:21,580
I see.

251
00:17:29,820 --> 00:17:31,800
I've seen the article.

252
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:35,220
Good. Pretty nice.

253
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:41,660
Well, prepare all the materials well and wait for my notice.

254
00:17:47,780 --> 00:17:53,040
Based on my observations at the scene, everyone is just purely curious and not malicious.

255
00:17:53,040 --> 00:17:57,520
It must be President Gao who is spreading messy rumors.

256
00:17:57,520 --> 00:18:00,860
Investigate who is helping him.

257
00:18:00,860 --> 00:18:02,460
Okay.

258
00:18:03,420 --> 00:18:06,540
What does President Lu think of Dr. Ye?

259
00:18:06,540 --> 00:18:09,299
Not bad. What's going on?

260
00:18:09,299 --> 00:18:12,160
Nothing. Just asking.

261
00:18:38,390 --> 00:18:39,640
<i>[Let's take a look at the bloody affair between the president of AX Hospital and the female pediatric doctor.]</i>

262
00:18:42,900 --> 00:18:45,570
<i>[The president experienced a painless delivery accompanied by a female doctor]</i>

263
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:22,180
Things in our hospital are starting to go awry.

264
00:19:23,139 --> 00:19:24,400
What?

265
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:25,980
Let me tell you.

266
00:19:25,980 --> 00:19:30,220
Last night, someone posted an article in our local forum,

267
00:19:30,739 --> 00:19:32,978
gossiping about President Lu and Dr. Ye.

268
00:19:32,978 --> 00:19:34,339
They are still updating.

269
00:19:34,339 --> 00:19:36,880
What's the point of all the gossip?

270
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:39,340
You won't know until you see it yourself.

271
00:19:47,940 --> 00:19:52,100
An upscale voluntary hospital with the initials "AX"...

272
00:19:52,100 --> 00:19:54,860
Is it different from speaking frankly?

273
00:19:54,860 --> 00:19:58,500
The person who posted this also said that he works in our hospital?

274
00:19:58,500 --> 00:20:00,560
I kind of believe it.

275
00:20:00,560 --> 00:20:02,619
A lot of things really happened in there,

276
00:20:02,619 --> 00:20:06,200
and a lot of gossip has been spread in the hospital for a while.

277
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:07,780
What are you talking about?

278
00:20:07,780 --> 00:20:11,700
Someone gossiped about Dr. Ye and President Lu online.

279
00:20:11,700 --> 00:20:16,339
It says Dr. Ye is a scheming woman who pretends to be a white lotus to seduce the president.

280
00:20:16,339 --> 00:20:18,559
No one would believe this kind of rumor, right?

281
00:20:18,559 --> 00:20:21,040
We know Dr. Ye so we don't believe it.

282
00:20:21,100 --> 00:20:27,800
But if you think about it, if you don't know Dr. Ye and you read this post... look, would you believe it?

283
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:30,519
"A female doctor was dispatched to a small village for medical assistance

284
00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:32,499
and couldn't come back for her poor performance.

285
00:20:32,499 --> 00:20:34,979
She met her new president at the village clinic,

286
00:20:34,979 --> 00:20:39,959
pretending to be a fool and refusing to believe his identity, which fascinated the president."

287
00:20:39,959 --> 00:20:41,420
But it's not the truth!

288
00:20:41,420 --> 00:20:44,580
But some people love to read so.

289
00:20:44,580 --> 00:20:47,960
To continue, it says, "When the new president left the clinic and took up the post,

290
00:20:47,960 --> 00:20:50,180
he recalled the female doctor back at once."

291
00:20:50,180 --> 00:20:51,740
It's true, right?

292
00:20:51,740 --> 00:20:55,959
As long as the true and the fake are coherent, someone will believe them to be the truth.

293
00:20:55,959 --> 00:21:00,999
And it says, "The Chief of Pediatrics was critical of her and arranged no shifts for her.

294
00:21:00,999 --> 00:21:02,970
The female doctor used some methods

295
00:21:02,970 --> 00:21:06,810
and paid some price to become the assistant of the president."

296
00:21:06,818 --> 00:21:09,860
Writing without knowing anything? Unbelievable!

297
00:21:09,860 --> 00:21:12,740
So the poster is a master.

298
00:21:12,740 --> 00:21:17,038
He can lead those readers to imagine those fancy parts themselves.

299
00:21:17,038 --> 00:21:21,160
And he says, "The female doctor's good at pleasing the president

300
00:21:21,160 --> 00:21:23,750
and spoke ill of the pediatrics chief.

301
00:21:23,750 --> 00:21:25,680
The president was fascinated by her

302
00:21:25,680 --> 00:21:28,170
and the president raged at the Chief of Pediatrics as if he had been drugged with ecstasy, and fired him.

303
00:21:28,179 --> 00:21:29,580
See. Falsehood blends with truth.

304
00:21:29,580 --> 00:21:32,160
You'll be led by him as long as you're careless.

305
00:21:32,160 --> 00:21:37,538
This person is really good at rhythm and has been interacting with the people who reply by adding details.

306
00:21:37,538 --> 00:21:41,198
He says the president is the son of the big boss and he's very rich.

307
00:21:41,198 --> 00:21:45,319
Because he got along with the doctor for two days in the clinic, he sent her a B-ultrasound machine.

308
00:21:45,319 --> 00:21:46,560
I've also read this.

309
00:21:46,560 --> 00:21:51,258
Someone remarked instantly that he should have slept with her in the clinic.

310
00:21:51,258 --> 00:21:53,499
It becomes more and more absurd.

311
00:21:53,499 --> 00:21:57,658
More than that. Dr. Ye gave many good suggestions, which were praised by the president. Right?

312
00:21:57,658 --> 00:22:02,420
They remarked she's ambitious and tries to intervene in his career.

313
00:22:02,420 --> 00:22:05,499
There's something wrong with this guy!

314
00:22:05,499 --> 00:22:07,900
Did he disclose her personal information?

315
00:22:07,900 --> 00:22:09,139
How could he not!

316
00:22:09,139 --> 00:22:11,240
He posted all her photos.

317
00:22:11,260 --> 00:22:13,570
The last time we were in the mall,

318
00:22:13,570 --> 00:22:16,650
Dr. Ye operated the labor pain experience device next to the president,

319
00:22:16,659 --> 00:22:18,250
and pictures of our free clinic in Taoyuan Village.

320
00:22:18,250 --> 00:22:20,390
Though he posted no photo of them two,

321
00:22:20,390 --> 00:22:23,329
it's still easy for others to search for more according to the village.

322
00:22:23,329 --> 00:22:26,600
A dirty heart sees everything as dirty.

323
00:22:26,600 --> 00:22:31,460
So what does the poster want? What is he planning?

324
00:22:31,460 --> 00:22:34,080
Someone did ask this and he answered too.

325
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:38,460
He said he couldn't stand such women who wanted to get things for nothing and marry a rich man,

326
00:22:38,460 --> 00:22:41,040
so he wanted to correct the social atmosphere.

327
00:22:41,040 --> 00:22:44,490
He really knows how to flatter himself.

328
00:22:44,490 --> 00:22:46,080
Morning.

329
00:22:51,060 --> 00:22:53,600
- Morning.
- Morning.

330
00:23:06,180 --> 00:23:07,219
Hello.

331
00:23:07,219 --> 00:23:09,179
<i>President, have you arrived?</i>

332
00:23:09,179 --> 00:23:10,399
Just arrived. What's going on?

333
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:11,460
<i>Something urgent.</i>

334
00:23:11,460 --> 00:23:13,520
<i>Check the link that I sent you.</i>

335
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:15,560
<i>I'm waiting in your office.</i>

336
00:23:42,479 --> 00:23:43,960
Ye Shilan!

337
00:23:47,300 --> 00:23:49,120
Why are you running so fast?

338
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:50,859
Why didn't you answer my call?

339
00:23:50,859 --> 00:23:53,360
I didn't find you in the Pediatrics office.

340
00:23:55,739 --> 00:23:57,180
My phone is on mute.

341
00:23:57,180 --> 00:23:59,000
I need to see patients.

342
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:01,580
Dr. Zeng said you've read the article.

343
00:24:04,739 --> 00:24:06,160
Just a little.

344
00:24:06,160 --> 00:24:10,340
As I found it fabricated, I couldn't continue reading it.

345
00:24:10,340 --> 00:24:11,859
Let others take over your shift.

346
00:24:11,859 --> 00:24:14,320
No, thanks. I'm fine.

347
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:16,480
Can you withdraw your bravado?

348
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:18,680
I'm really fine.

349
00:24:18,680 --> 00:24:20,280
Go to deal with it first.

350
00:24:20,280 --> 00:24:23,080
My patient will arrive soon.

351
00:24:32,139 --> 00:24:34,960
PR Department is trying to contact the web to delete it.

352
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:38,720
And they said he posted the article on many other websites.

353
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:40,600
I'll follow it up.

354
00:24:41,739 --> 00:24:44,300
Someone spent so much money on it.

355
00:24:44,300 --> 00:24:47,520
Also, claiming to be an employee of Anxing Hospital?

356
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:49,799
I can't stand it.

357
00:24:49,799 --> 00:24:51,619
I have to talk with Gao Xuan myself.

358
00:24:51,619 --> 00:24:53,440
President, don't be impulsive.

359
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:55,379
If there is no evidence, you will only be beaten.

360
00:24:55,379 --> 00:24:57,560
And it might mess up our plans.

361
00:24:57,560 --> 00:25:00,420
Haven't we always hoped that President Gao would take action?

362
00:25:00,420 --> 00:25:02,180
He should aim at me if he has the means!

363
00:25:02,180 --> 00:25:04,099
Ye Shilan is obviously an irrelevant person!

364
00:25:04,099 --> 00:25:07,800
Dr. Ye is your girlfriend, then she is a relevant person.

365
00:25:10,940 --> 00:25:12,060
Calm down first.

366
00:25:12,060 --> 00:25:14,020
Let's analyze it.

367
00:25:21,420 --> 00:25:26,440
Those rumors now appear to be laying the groundwork.

368
00:25:26,440 --> 00:25:30,160
He gained details from the spreading and then reset their causalities

369
00:25:30,160 --> 00:25:33,710
in order to gain attention during posting online.

370
00:25:33,719 --> 00:25:36,960
But why does he choose to aim at Ye Shilan?

371
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:38,739
I think there are two reasons.

372
00:25:38,739 --> 00:25:41,300
First. Ye Shilan is your weakness.

373
00:25:41,300 --> 00:25:44,720
Using her to tackle you can save his energy.

374
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:48,540
Second. President Gao is good at dallying with public opinion.

375
00:25:48,540 --> 00:25:55,480
If the topic uses a woman with a superior body as a gimmick, it will be more likely to spark discussion and spread.

376
00:25:55,480 --> 00:25:57,940
Men and women will stand up and accuse her.

377
00:25:57,940 --> 00:26:02,100
If the theme is an unfaithful playboy,

378
00:26:02,100 --> 00:26:04,370
men might lose interest.

379
00:26:04,370 --> 00:26:07,710
Though you're his goal,

380
00:26:07,710 --> 00:26:10,680
he chooses to attack Dr. Ye first

381
00:26:10,680 --> 00:26:16,060
and there are obviously many people who are rhythmically discrediting you in the replies.

382
00:26:16,060 --> 00:26:18,480
I'm not a male star

383
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:20,600
so what does he want?

384
00:26:21,700 --> 00:26:28,000
As long as there are enough details, this kind of gossip can spread widely enough, and many people will believe it.

385
00:26:28,019 --> 00:26:32,259
Even if they aren't truly convinced, it will leave an impression in their minds.

386
00:26:32,259 --> 00:26:36,499
As long as they hear Anxing Hospital, they'll recall it subconsciously.

387
00:26:40,780 --> 00:26:42,940
Now I see.

388
00:26:42,940 --> 00:26:47,580
Maybe someone will say that my privacy affects the hospital's reputation

389
00:26:47,580 --> 00:26:50,440
and I'm not suitable to be the president.

390
00:26:50,440 --> 00:26:52,780
So he can get away with it.

391
00:26:54,300 --> 00:26:57,480
It seems to be his purpose.

392
00:27:00,180 --> 00:27:05,820
Such being the case, go to work first and try to get some valuable information.

393
00:27:05,820 --> 00:27:07,300
I see.

394
00:27:09,280 --> 00:27:13,559
By the way. How is Dr. Ye?

395
00:27:19,219 --> 00:27:23,000
How could it be possible to get better after being splashed with dirty water?

396
00:27:25,820 --> 00:27:28,120
I'm getting a headache over this.

397
00:27:48,360 --> 00:27:49,700
She doesn't need to take any more medicine.

398
00:27:49,700 --> 00:27:51,079
Return here after three months.

399
00:27:51,080 --> 00:27:53,419
- Okay. I'll remember to make an appointment.
- Fine.

400
00:27:53,419 --> 00:27:54,739
Mengmeng, say "Thank you, Dr. Ye".

401
00:27:54,739 --> 00:27:56,300
Thank you, Dr. Ye.

402
00:27:56,300 --> 00:27:57,438
You're welcome.

403
00:27:57,438 --> 00:27:58,339
Say goodbye to her.

404
00:27:58,339 --> 00:28:00,358
- Goodbye.
- Bye-bye.

405
00:28:00,359 --> 00:28:01,438
- Let's go.
- Take care.

406
00:28:01,438 --> 00:28:02,920
We will.

407
00:28:30,660 --> 00:28:32,919
<i>I've seen so many people like her.</i>

408
00:28:32,920 --> 00:28:34,379
<i>Poor working ability.</i>

409
00:28:34,379 --> 00:28:36,520
<i>Only knows to flatter leaders.</i>

410
00:28:36,520 --> 00:28:37,900
<i>It takes two to tango.</i>

411
00:28:37,900 --> 00:28:40,019
<i>The man is bad, too.</i>

412
00:28:40,019 --> 00:28:42,619
<i>Being the president is to play the field, right?</i>

413
00:28:42,619 --> 00:28:44,880
<i>She can get everything with pillow talk.</i>

414
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:48,019
<i>I don't think she wants to be a good doctor.</i>

415
00:28:48,019 --> 00:28:49,460
<i>A 30-year-old president?</i>

416
00:28:49,460 --> 00:28:51,180
<i>Can only thing with his lower body.</i>

417
00:28:51,180 --> 00:28:53,800
<i>Anxing is about to end.</i>

418
00:28:53,800 --> 00:28:56,838
<i>Who will take their children to see this doctor in the future?</i>

419
00:28:56,839 --> 00:28:58,900
<i>I think both of them need to be expelled!</i>

420
00:28:58,900 --> 00:29:02,480
<i>Does anyone want to organize a group to go to Anxing Hospital to see for themselves?</i>

421
00:29:08,739 --> 00:29:11,019
You said you weren't going to look at it?

422
00:29:11,019 --> 00:29:13,220
I'm just looking around.

423
00:29:14,619 --> 00:29:15,700
Stop reading it.

424
00:29:15,700 --> 00:29:17,440
Otherwise, you'll feel worse.

425
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:20,000
Assistant Lin is also finding someone to help with it.

426
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:45,560
- He updates again.
- And then?

427
00:29:45,560 --> 00:29:46,920
Let me read it.

428
00:29:46,920 --> 00:29:48,700
He says, "The female doctor is good at handling people.

429
00:29:48,700 --> 00:29:50,799
Others gossiped she entangled the president

430
00:29:50,800 --> 00:29:52,580
and then the president said he chased her

431
00:29:52,580 --> 00:29:54,378
in a public meeting.

432
00:29:54,378 --> 00:29:55,838
So awkward."

433
00:29:55,839 --> 00:29:59,038
Immediately below someone commented, "This white lotus flower glass heart

434
00:29:59,038 --> 00:30:02,480
asked her kaiser to save her face."

435
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:04,400
Isn't this nonsense?

436
00:30:05,019 --> 00:30:08,198
The present doctors said the on-site atmosphere was good.

437
00:30:08,199 --> 00:30:11,260
Did Dr. Ye offend anyone?

438
00:30:12,460 --> 00:30:15,020
Maybe President Lu offended someone.

439
00:30:16,259 --> 00:30:18,480
Yeah. Maybe.

440
00:30:20,400 --> 00:30:23,999
Shall we register an account to reply to him?

441
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:25,738
Tell him we're Dr. Ye's co-workers

442
00:30:25,738 --> 00:30:27,299
and she's not such a person.

443
00:30:27,299 --> 00:30:29,379
I've thought of it.

444
00:30:29,380 --> 00:30:31,519
What about him reading it in an excessive way?

445
00:30:31,520 --> 00:30:34,100
What if he says President Lu forced us to do so?

446
00:30:34,100 --> 00:30:37,100
But we can't stay here and do nothing!

447
00:30:37,100 --> 00:30:38,838
We've talked to Assistant Lin.

448
00:30:38,839 --> 00:30:41,838
He says the group is tackling it and for us not to worry about it.

449
00:30:41,839 --> 00:30:44,618
Besides, they've posted on many websites

450
00:30:44,618 --> 00:30:47,540
and we can't explain to them one by one. Right?

451
00:30:50,460 --> 00:30:52,340
Why is Dr. Ye not here?

452
00:30:52,340 --> 00:30:54,960
She was called away by the president.

453
00:31:04,060 --> 00:31:06,420
President, here's your take-out.

454
00:31:07,700 --> 00:31:09,400
Thank you.

455
00:31:42,860 --> 00:31:45,180
Come on. Have something sweet.

456
00:31:45,180 --> 00:31:46,840
Change your mood.

457
00:31:48,190 --> 00:31:49,600
Thank you.

458
00:31:54,060 --> 00:31:56,180
You were scolded a lot, too.

459
00:31:56,180 --> 00:31:58,420
Don't think too much about it.

460
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:01,400
I don't care about it.

461
00:32:07,320 --> 00:32:11,900
But will this incident have any effect on your being the president?

462
00:32:12,979 --> 00:32:15,498
Rest assured. It's just a rumor.

463
00:32:15,498 --> 00:32:17,300
Not that serious.

464
00:32:18,850 --> 00:32:21,080
It's all my fault.

465
00:32:21,080 --> 00:32:23,660
It's all my fault for making it public at the spur of the moment.

466
00:32:23,660 --> 00:32:26,620
Otherwise, things wouldn't be like this,

467
00:32:26,620 --> 00:32:28,620
and no one would post it online.

468
00:32:29,599 --> 00:32:33,400
It's neither your fault nor my fault.

469
00:32:33,400 --> 00:32:36,200
Don't look for reasons on yourself.

470
00:32:36,200 --> 00:32:38,180
It's always been like this.

471
00:32:39,339 --> 00:32:43,520
As long as I get carried away, things will go wrong.

472
00:32:47,379 --> 00:32:49,640
Don't think that way.

473
00:32:50,660 --> 00:32:54,020
Someone is aiming at me this time.

474
00:32:54,020 --> 00:32:56,580
You were innocently implicated.

475
00:32:56,580 --> 00:32:58,600
Who is aiming at you?

476
00:32:59,520 --> 00:33:01,960
There's something I haven't told you.

477
00:33:01,960 --> 00:33:04,000
Mainly because I don't want you to worry too much.

478
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:06,600
I want you to feel at ease and be a good doctor.

479
00:33:06,600 --> 00:33:10,780
But now it seems I think you need to know.

480
00:33:11,560 --> 00:33:14,699
I parachuted into An Xing Hospital to be the president for two main purposes:

481
00:33:14,699 --> 00:33:17,020
One is that the managements are not united

482
00:33:17,020 --> 00:33:19,478
and system upgrades are untimely with poor implementation,

483
00:33:19,479 --> 00:33:22,219
which has adverse effects on doctors' working environment.

484
00:33:22,219 --> 00:33:23,659
As my status is special,

485
00:33:23,659 --> 00:33:26,840
I can solve them in a fast and convenient way.

486
00:33:27,580 --> 00:33:30,478
And the second reason is to solve

487
00:33:30,479 --> 00:33:33,640
the main crux of the series of problems that have plagued the hospital.

488
00:33:33,640 --> 00:33:35,140
President Gao.

489
00:33:36,180 --> 00:33:37,760
President Gao?

490
00:33:39,350 --> 00:33:41,078
He used to be my father's subordinate.

491
00:33:41,079 --> 00:33:44,780
He's colluded with some people in the group in private.

492
00:33:44,780 --> 00:33:46,800
They're all in key departments,

493
00:33:46,800 --> 00:33:50,880
covering each other and filling their own pockets.

494
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:52,820
They harm shareholders' interests

495
00:33:52,820 --> 00:33:54,840
but it's hard to get something on them.

496
00:33:55,500 --> 00:34:00,600
It's also hard to get a handle on which of them are in this small group, and we don't know very well.

497
00:34:00,620 --> 00:34:02,920
Your dad can't solve it?

498
00:34:03,860 --> 00:34:06,000
Management needs to convince the public.

499
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:08,620
We have no proof and he's an old employee

500
00:34:08,620 --> 00:34:11,579
so it's not good for us to treat him forcibly.

501
00:34:11,579 --> 00:34:13,560
And will likely bring us trouble.

502
00:34:14,239 --> 00:34:15,900
But more importantly.

503
00:34:15,900 --> 00:34:20,720
My dad also decided to take this opportunity to carry out a thorough purge.

504
00:34:20,720 --> 00:34:23,680
Does President Gao know about it?

505
00:34:23,680 --> 00:34:26,020
He seems to think I'm targeting him

506
00:34:26,020 --> 00:34:28,160
so he is in a rush t get rid of me.

507
00:34:28,160 --> 00:34:31,709
I want to take advantage of this audit opportunity to force him to make a move

508
00:34:31,800 --> 00:34:37,200
So we can get some evidence and see who is covering him.

509
00:34:37,220 --> 00:34:41,800
But I never thought he would point to our relationship...

510
00:34:41,800 --> 00:34:44,100
and hurt you.

511
00:34:44,100 --> 00:34:47,100
You mean it's President Gao

512
00:34:47,100 --> 00:34:49,319
who instigates today's matter from behind the scenes?

513
00:34:49,320 --> 00:34:50,620
Not only today.

514
00:34:50,620 --> 00:34:53,500
He spread those rumors on purpose.

515
00:34:55,900 --> 00:34:59,140
So I should apologize to you

516
00:34:59,140 --> 00:35:01,260
for bringing you so much trouble.

517
00:35:01,940 --> 00:35:05,500
Haven't you told me it's not our fault?

518
00:35:07,139 --> 00:35:11,360
I thought it was because someone hated me.

519
00:35:11,360 --> 00:35:15,100
As now I know the trouble may be valuable,

520
00:35:15,100 --> 00:35:18,260
the previous injustice was not in vain. Right?

521
00:35:18,260 --> 00:35:20,820
Why are you so optimistic all of a sudden?

522
00:35:21,379 --> 00:35:24,080
Don't you tell me to be optimistic?

523
00:35:24,080 --> 00:35:28,920
Besides, my father told me not to care about others' opinions.

524
00:35:28,920 --> 00:35:32,280
Their words can't hurt your body.

525
00:35:32,280 --> 00:35:36,100
Though I can't do it now,

526
00:35:36,100 --> 00:35:38,760
I'll try my best to modify myself.

527
00:35:39,480 --> 00:35:43,058
If so, it's fine for you to release your

528
00:35:43,058 --> 00:35:45,500
negative emotions by swearing and so on.

529
00:35:45,500 --> 00:35:47,220
Who wants to swear?

530
00:35:47,220 --> 00:35:50,720
I'm now a foxy sorceress

531
00:35:50,720 --> 00:35:54,680
who can play with the president in the palm of her hand.

532
00:35:54,680 --> 00:35:56,298
Still thinking about joking?

533
00:35:56,298 --> 00:35:57,559
I'm optimistic.

534
00:35:57,560 --> 00:35:59,320
You're not optimistic.

535
00:35:59,320 --> 00:36:01,520
You're now simple-minded.

536
00:36:01,520 --> 00:36:05,220
I just want to be simple-minded when I'm with you.

537
00:36:07,180 --> 00:36:08,780
Sweet mouth.

538
00:36:09,850 --> 00:36:12,699
Come on. Then I'll feed you a bite of cake.

539
00:36:13,660 --> 00:36:15,440
It's your reward.

540
00:36:33,440 --> 00:36:35,060
Secretary Chen.

541
00:36:35,060 --> 00:36:36,800
<i>Excuse me, Assistant Lin.</i>

542
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:38,619
<i>I was in a meeting with President Lu this afternoon.</i>

543
00:36:38,620 --> 00:36:40,360
<i>What's the matter?</i>

544
00:36:40,360 --> 00:36:44,380
I want to know why the PR Department was so inefficient today.

545
00:36:44,380 --> 00:36:45,579
It's useless to urge them.

546
00:36:45,579 --> 00:36:47,820
Could you please help me ask them?

547
00:36:52,819 --> 00:36:55,400
<i>You'd better ask Chairman Lu in person.</i>

548
00:36:55,400 --> 00:36:57,660
<i>PR Director has already reported to him.</i>

549
00:36:57,660 --> 00:37:00,680
Okay, I see. Thank you.

550
00:37:12,280 --> 00:37:13,480
<i>[Chairman Lu]</i>

551
00:37:23,139 --> 00:37:25,760
Okay. I'll go to see you at once.

552
00:37:27,579 --> 00:37:29,300
Lin Kaiwen!

553
00:37:30,059 --> 00:37:33,019
You've stood here for a while but why don't you come inside?

554
00:37:33,020 --> 00:37:34,860
I have something urgent now.

555
00:37:35,779 --> 00:37:38,460
Then you haven't had dinner yet, have you?

556
00:37:38,460 --> 00:37:40,360
Then wait for me.

557
00:37:54,479 --> 00:37:56,460
Take it on the road to eat.

558
00:37:56,460 --> 00:37:57,900
Thank you.

559
00:38:02,779 --> 00:38:05,179
You seem very busy today.

560
00:38:05,179 --> 00:38:07,120
Didn't Dr. Ye tell you?

561
00:38:08,130 --> 00:38:09,820
No.

562
00:38:44,059 --> 00:38:48,100
Has Lu Zhaoxi found that you've been reporting to me?

563
00:38:48,100 --> 00:38:48,860
No.

564
00:38:48,860 --> 00:38:50,640
Should I tell him?

565
00:38:50,640 --> 00:38:52,040
No.

566
00:38:54,220 --> 00:38:58,600
I asked the PR Department to slow down.

567
00:38:58,600 --> 00:38:59,840
Why?

568
00:38:59,900 --> 00:39:04,100
It doesn't matter how fast or slow the speed is, the impact is already out.

569
00:39:04,180 --> 00:39:07,420
It's better to let Gao Xuan win to be more satisfied.

570
00:39:07,420 --> 00:39:09,760
And also I want to know

571
00:39:09,760 --> 00:39:12,140
what cards he holds in his hands.

572
00:39:14,050 --> 00:39:15,600
I see.

573
00:39:19,460 --> 00:39:22,060
I know Gao Xuan well.

574
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:28,100
You deliberately gave him that bit of information before, and he couldn't possibly trust you completely.

575
00:39:29,059 --> 00:39:32,620
It's a good chance now.

576
00:39:32,620 --> 00:39:36,260
I don't want to delay it anymore.

577
00:39:36,260 --> 00:39:39,000
I see. I'll wait for your notice.

578
00:39:40,880 --> 00:39:45,120
By the way, pause Dr. Ye's shifts first.

579
00:39:45,120 --> 00:39:47,760
What should I tell President Lu?

580
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:49,660
Tell him it's my decision.

581
00:39:51,120 --> 00:39:52,400
Okay.

582
00:39:56,320 --> 00:39:59,540
Aunt and Qiao Yu sent me messages this afternoon.

583
00:39:59,540 --> 00:40:00,839
They asked me to relax.

584
00:40:00,840 --> 00:40:02,340
Just ignore it.

585
00:40:02,340 --> 00:40:03,960
They sent a text to me too

586
00:40:03,960 --> 00:40:05,800
and asked me to care for you more.

587
00:40:05,800 --> 00:40:08,320
They didn't care about my emotions.

588
00:40:09,700 --> 00:40:12,980
Probably because they think you have thick skin.

589
00:40:13,619 --> 00:40:15,440
It's true.

590
00:40:20,399 --> 00:40:21,720
Hello?

591
00:40:21,720 --> 00:40:24,260
<i>President, are you now with Dr. Ye?</i>

592
00:40:24,260 --> 00:40:26,600
Yes. I'm driving her home.

593
00:40:26,600 --> 00:40:30,820
<i>I just received a notice from the group to temporarily suspend Dr. Ye's schedule.</i>

594
00:40:34,900 --> 00:40:37,380
This is out of the group's control. Right?

595
00:40:37,380 --> 00:40:39,920
<i>Chairman Lu made the decision personally.</i>

596
00:40:40,620 --> 00:40:42,300
Fine. I see.
