<i>[Episode 22]</i>

16
00:02:01,190 --> 00:02:03,465
Why don't you turn on the lights?

17
00:02:03,465 --> 00:02:05,059
When did you come back?

18
00:02:05,059 --> 00:02:06,619
Just now.

19
00:02:06,619 --> 00:02:08,300
Didn't you hear me open the door?

20
00:02:08,300 --> 00:02:10,180
No, I didn't.

21
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:15,900
Did you suddenly have inspiration and are writing here without changing your clothes?

22
00:02:15,965 --> 00:02:18,310
I want to stir up dark emotions.

23
00:02:18,310 --> 00:02:19,760
Let me turn off the light?

24
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:22,019
No, that's enough.

25
00:02:23,162 --> 00:02:25,141
It's been a long time since I saw you write so smoothly.

26
00:02:25,141 --> 00:02:26,381
I'm not writing.

27
00:02:26,381 --> 00:02:27,459
What're you doing?

28
00:02:27,459 --> 00:02:31,390
Answering back the post spreading rumors about you and Lu Zhaoxi.

29
00:02:31,390 --> 00:02:32,918
I type too slowly on the phone.

30
00:02:32,918 --> 00:02:34,700
It's faster on the laptop.

31
00:02:34,700 --> 00:02:37,139
How dare they!

32
00:02:37,139 --> 00:02:40,239
I, Yao Jiajia, am a writer at least.

33
00:02:40,239 --> 00:02:41,820
If anyone scolds my friend,

34
00:02:41,820 --> 00:02:46,100
I'll bombard him or her with nightmarish criticism.

35
00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:53,660
How did you know?

36
00:02:53,660 --> 00:02:56,000
Lin Kaiwen told me.

37
00:02:56,819 --> 00:02:59,279
Why didn't you tell me?

38
00:02:59,279 --> 00:03:01,888
I intended to tell you when I got back home.

39
00:03:07,999 --> 00:03:10,440
I love you so much.

40
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:17,540
If I fall into the water with Lu Zhaoxi, who will you save?

41
00:03:18,559 --> 00:03:20,980
Both of you can swim,

42
00:03:20,980 --> 00:03:25,819
I'll stay away so I don't fall and cause you trouble.

43
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:32,319
All right. Don't waste time on such boring people.

44
00:03:32,319 --> 00:03:34,700
Come out to chat with me.

45
00:03:35,939 --> 00:03:37,840
Okay.

46
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:40,170
Some duck necks were left in the refrigerator.

47
00:03:40,170 --> 00:03:41,558
With some cold beer.

48
00:03:41,558 --> 00:03:42,939
Perfect.

49
00:03:42,939 --> 00:03:45,238
Go.

50
00:03:48,579 --> 00:03:52,160
It turns out that someone deliberately tried to discredit you.

51
00:03:53,199 --> 00:03:58,179
So now I can only adjust my mentality and let them solve the problem.

52
00:03:58,179 --> 00:04:01,142
Aren't you angry at all?

53
00:04:01,142 --> 00:04:03,520
I can only shift my attention.

54
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:07,279
Lu Zhaoxi watched a movie with me after work.

55
00:04:08,569 --> 00:04:10,280
Come on.

56
00:04:16,419 --> 00:04:22,000
Those people are so dumb, bad, and simple-minded.

57
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:26,798
On browsing a fabricated post, they're so sincere and full of righteous indignation.

58
00:04:26,798 --> 00:04:30,499
It seems only by complaints and following the herd can it prove they're literate.

59
00:04:30,499 --> 00:04:35,539
As far as I can see, their central ideas are almost the same.

60
00:04:35,979 --> 00:04:41,300
Let alone the post is nonsense, even if it's real, you hurt no one.

61
00:04:41,300 --> 00:04:44,259
They're not moral models.

62
00:04:44,259 --> 00:04:46,959
A male peacock will court a female by flaunting its tail.

63
00:04:46,959 --> 00:04:49,970
Can't a woman radiate with charm?

64
00:04:49,970 --> 00:04:53,710
They're apt to use words like "seduce" and "shameless."

65
00:04:53,710 --> 00:04:55,619
They're so hostile to women.

66
00:04:55,619 --> 00:05:00,140
In my opinion, this is a very remarkable skill.

67
00:05:00,140 --> 00:05:02,359
I feel the same way.

68
00:05:02,359 --> 00:05:06,619
Either a woman pleasing a man, or a man pleasing a woman,

69
00:05:06,619 --> 00:05:09,298
as long as it's legal with no one getting hurt

70
00:05:09,298 --> 00:05:10,858
and both are happy,

71
00:05:10,858 --> 00:05:14,219
it's such a harmonious and beautiful thing.

72
00:05:14,219 --> 00:05:16,780
Exactly!

73
00:05:18,412 --> 00:05:21,499
And think about it, what's the fuss about a rich boyfriend?

74
00:05:21,499 --> 00:05:23,539
Can't a rich guy be loved?

75
00:05:23,539 --> 00:05:26,280
Do people only see him for money?

76
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:29,820
As I see it, it's obvious that they only focus on money and don't see love,

77
00:05:29,820 --> 00:05:32,520
and I think others are also the same.

78
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:37,480
On hearing your words, I've no reason to be angry.

79
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:41,179
I used to be scolded. I'm experienced.

80
00:05:41,179 --> 00:05:43,999
As long as you see the nature of the scolding,

81
00:05:43,999 --> 00:05:46,780
you'll be relieved.

82
00:05:47,728 --> 00:05:50,050
Learn from my predecessor.

83
00:05:50,660 --> 00:05:52,359
Come on.

84
00:06:08,540 --> 00:06:10,419
Dad.

85
00:06:10,419 --> 00:06:13,100
You're here. Sit.

86
00:06:17,340 --> 00:06:19,300
Eat some.

87
00:06:19,300 --> 00:06:21,179
I'm not hungry, you eat.

88
00:06:21,739 --> 00:06:23,640
Dislike it?

89
00:06:33,179 --> 00:06:37,300
You said it was an emergency. Go ahead.

90
00:06:37,300 --> 00:06:42,058
Why did you stop Ye Shilan's shift?

91
00:06:42,058 --> 00:06:43,519
You don't think I should have?

92
00:06:43,519 --> 00:06:45,500
No, you shouldn't.

93
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:47,578
You know Gao Xuan spread rumors deliberately.

94
00:06:47,578 --> 00:06:50,160
You clearly know that this is a rumor intentionally created by Gao Xuan,

95
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:52,690
isn't stopping Ye Shilan from her shift telling everyone that the group is punishing her?

96
00:06:52,699 --> 00:06:56,039
What does Ye Shilan think? Does she think so?

97
00:06:56,760 --> 00:07:00,160
She said she respected the group's decision,

98
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:02,499
but I think she doesn't want to make things difficult for me.

99
00:07:02,499 --> 00:07:04,679
But why are you making things difficult for her?

100
00:07:04,679 --> 00:07:07,060
When did I make things difficult for her?

101
00:07:07,060 --> 00:07:10,579
You know clearly why you became president,

102
00:07:10,579 --> 00:07:13,679
but why did you want to have a girlfriend at this time?

103
00:07:14,179 --> 00:07:16,640
There's no conflict between them.

104
00:07:17,508 --> 00:07:19,500
I heard it from your mom

105
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:24,158
that Ye Shilan wanted to keep your relationship a secret for fear of rumors.

106
00:07:26,699 --> 00:07:29,640
Weren't you worried about others' rumors?

107
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:32,499
I think there is no need to worry.

108
00:07:32,499 --> 00:07:36,199
Yes, you think there was no need.

109
00:07:36,199 --> 00:07:38,959
That's why you took Ye Shilan's advice

110
00:07:38,959 --> 00:07:42,359
and praised her at the meeting

111
00:07:42,359 --> 00:07:45,200
for offering a free clinic service at Taoyuan Village.

112
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:49,099
It was you who pushed her forward, you know?

113
00:07:49,099 --> 00:07:51,240
Yes, I understand

114
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:55,020
you want others to know your girlfriend is excellent,

115
00:07:55,020 --> 00:07:59,899
but this became Gao Xuan's source of materials against you.

116
00:07:59,899 --> 00:08:02,200
Do you know how people are talking about you?

117
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:07,779
They said Anxing Hospital's rules should be called Ye Shilan's rules.

118
00:08:10,979 --> 00:08:13,180
It's not the case.

119
00:08:13,180 --> 00:08:15,700
I'm considerate of all the staff.

120
00:08:15,700 --> 00:08:18,640
I know it's not the case,

121
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:21,820
but what will ignorant people think?

122
00:08:22,419 --> 00:08:26,159
Do you still think their worries are ungrounded?

123
00:08:28,859 --> 00:08:33,859
If you had known earlier Gao Xuan would make an issue of this,

124
00:08:33,859 --> 00:08:36,679
you'd have been low-profile and taken precautions.

125
00:08:36,679 --> 00:08:40,639
But I know you could not foresee this

126
00:08:40,639 --> 00:08:42,818
for you never encountered any great setback.

127
00:08:42,818 --> 00:08:46,300
Your life has been so smooth that you'd never expect

128
00:08:46,300 --> 00:08:52,193
Gao Xuan would involve people around you in with unscrupulous and filthy tricks.

129
00:08:56,740 --> 00:08:58,680
Yes.

130
00:08:58,680 --> 00:09:02,520
It's my fault.

131
00:09:04,259 --> 00:09:09,779
There's nothing so clean in the world.

132
00:09:12,699 --> 00:09:16,039
Taste it. It's quite good.

133
00:09:42,908 --> 00:09:45,020
It went viral online at about 7:00 a.m.

134
00:09:45,020 --> 00:09:47,498
Some marketing accounts commented and forwarded it,

135
00:09:47,498 --> 00:09:50,179
probably to increase its influence.

136
00:09:50,179 --> 00:09:51,920
The hot search position is not very high,

137
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:54,980
it will only take a few hours to go down naturally.

138
00:09:54,980 --> 00:09:57,179
He did spend a lot on this.

139
00:09:57,179 --> 00:09:59,838
Chairman Lu should've expected President Gao would do this.

140
00:09:59,838 --> 00:10:03,919
Stopping Dr. Ye's work is good for her.

141
00:10:03,919 --> 00:10:05,240
Why?

142
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:08,378
This hot search does not rule out that there will be bored netizens

143
00:10:08,378 --> 00:10:11,859
deliberately seeking Dr. Ye to make Dr. Ye feel embarrassed.

144
00:10:15,259 --> 00:10:17,280
Is anyone really that bored?

145
00:10:17,280 --> 00:10:19,100
Maybe.

146
00:10:25,519 --> 00:10:27,320
I'm drinking it.

147
00:10:27,980 --> 00:10:30,080
Don't worry. I'm fine.

148
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:32,219
Mind your business.

149
00:10:33,919 --> 00:10:36,380
Well, see you later.

150
00:10:54,379 --> 00:10:55,378
Hello?

151
00:10:55,378 --> 00:10:58,140
<i>You're so shameless. You don't deserve to be a pediatrician.</i>

152
00:10:58,140 --> 00:11:01,098
<i>Damn you! With no conscience!</i>

153
00:11:18,259 --> 00:11:21,750
Dr. Ye, is someone harassing you?

154
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:27,713
I don't know how they got my number.

155
00:11:27,713 --> 00:11:31,109
As long as you are active online, it is easy to leak out.

156
00:11:31,109 --> 00:11:34,498
You've answered questions on medical websites before, right?

157
00:11:34,498 --> 00:11:36,139
Yes.

158
00:11:36,139 --> 00:11:37,819
It's possible.

159
00:11:37,819 --> 00:11:38,979
Turn off the phone today.

160
00:11:38,979 --> 00:11:42,320
No one will care about this once the trending search is over.

161
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:46,760
I know. People like trendy topics.

162
00:11:47,222 --> 00:11:49,739
There are always some people who like to stand on the moral high ground

163
00:11:49,739 --> 00:11:51,938
to criticize others in an immoral way.

164
00:11:51,938 --> 00:11:54,559
It's schizophrenia.

165
00:11:54,559 --> 00:11:56,779
They're sick in the head.

166
00:11:56,779 --> 00:11:58,759
Don't be fussy with them.

167
00:11:58,759 --> 00:11:59,985
I'm okay.

168
00:11:59,985 --> 00:12:02,110
You do have a strong heart.

169
00:12:03,159 --> 00:12:05,139
Is President investigating this?

170
00:12:05,139 --> 00:12:07,240
Who's behind it?

171
00:12:07,240 --> 00:12:09,640
Isn't it enough?

172
00:12:11,579 --> 00:12:13,479
I don't know.

173
00:12:24,860 --> 00:12:26,939
Have you been busy these days?

174
00:12:26,939 --> 00:12:30,280
Yes, handling the trending topic.

175
00:12:30,280 --> 00:12:32,894
Have a break. Have some tea.

176
00:12:34,019 --> 00:12:36,440
Come on, sit down.

177
00:12:41,100 --> 00:12:44,240
How's President Lu?

178
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:47,960
Not so good. After all, the president grew up pampered.

179
00:12:47,960 --> 00:12:49,499
It's his first time to be scolded by so many people.

180
00:12:49,499 --> 00:12:52,579
I heard he was severely criticized by his dad.

181
00:12:53,220 --> 00:12:56,133
It's not a bad thing at all for him.

182
00:12:56,133 --> 00:13:01,299
It's good for a youngster to have a little setback for the sake of his future development.

183
00:13:01,299 --> 00:13:03,219
You're right.

184
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:08,870
You know, these days the group leaders

185
00:13:08,870 --> 00:13:12,200
call me from time to time about what happened.

186
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:14,678
I told them I didn't know and it wasn't clear.

187
00:13:14,678 --> 00:13:19,554
But President Lu works dutifully, doesn't he?

188
00:13:19,555 --> 00:13:24,550
Yes, he does. But the incident did have a bad effect on the hospital's reputation.

189
00:13:24,550 --> 00:13:27,100
The leaders said the same.

190
00:13:27,100 --> 00:13:30,860
They also said that they didn't want Lu Zhaoxi to be the president at the beginning.

191
00:13:30,860 --> 00:13:32,859
It was Chairman Lu who insisted.

192
00:13:32,859 --> 00:13:35,379
That's why he's so angry.

193
00:13:35,379 --> 00:13:37,220
I know him best.

194
00:13:37,220 --> 00:13:41,740
He hates this kind of person who has an improper relationship between men and women.

195
00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:46,900
Do you think he'll believe the post?

196
00:13:47,459 --> 00:13:49,440
I don't know.

197
00:13:50,540 --> 00:13:52,040
Do you believe it?

198
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:54,719
I don't, of course.

199
00:13:54,719 --> 00:13:57,400
but some people do.

200
00:13:57,400 --> 00:14:03,199
Since it was exposed, President Lu and Dr. Ye haven't come forward to say anything.

201
00:14:04,559 --> 00:14:07,700
President Gao, with your knowledge of Chairman Lu,

202
00:14:07,700 --> 00:14:10,779
will there be any personnel changes?

203
00:14:11,939 --> 00:14:15,580
Lin, that's why I appreciate you.

204
00:14:15,580 --> 00:14:18,340
Capable and understanding the times.

205
00:14:18,340 --> 00:14:24,280
I'm telling you... This personnel change is just a matter of time.

206
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:28,959
Associate Dean Xu may be the next president.

207
00:14:28,959 --> 00:14:31,280
Why not you?

208
00:14:31,280 --> 00:14:33,759
Let professionals do professional things.

209
00:14:33,759 --> 00:14:37,059
Isn't it good for us to assist them?

210
00:14:37,059 --> 00:14:38,880
Us?

211
00:14:39,599 --> 00:14:41,860
You and me.

212
00:14:42,420 --> 00:14:44,600
Lin, don't worry.

213
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:46,519
Whoever the president is,

214
00:14:46,519 --> 00:14:51,659
I'll try my best to recommend you to stay.

215
00:14:51,659 --> 00:14:53,019
Thank you in advance.

216
00:14:53,019 --> 00:14:55,459
Welcome. Have some tea.

217
00:14:56,640 --> 00:15:01,430
You're right. President Gao probably still has some things in his hands that haven't been released.

218
00:15:01,430 --> 00:15:04,020
When you assigned Dr. Ye as the assistant,

219
00:15:04,020 --> 00:15:06,820
he may have investigated Dr. Ye.

220
00:15:07,479 --> 00:15:10,375
Okay. I'll wait for your call.

221
00:15:13,260 --> 00:15:16,420
<i>[Anxing Hospital]</i>

222
00:15:26,699 --> 00:15:28,859
Hello, Anxing Hospital's Pediatrics Department.

223
00:15:28,859 --> 00:15:31,479
<i>Yezi, why did you turn off your phone?</i>

224
00:15:31,479 --> 00:15:35,260
Your mom is try urgently to find you and called me.

225
00:15:35,260 --> 00:15:38,060
I know. I'll get back to her.

226
00:15:38,060 --> 00:15:40,019
<i>Are you okay?</i>

227
00:15:40,540 --> 00:15:45,480
Fine, I'll tell you later. I'll hang up.

228
00:15:53,220 --> 00:15:55,219
<i>Nobody knows it around me.</i>

229
00:15:55,219 --> 00:15:57,038
<i>Your brother found it first.</i>

230
00:15:57,038 --> 00:15:59,459
<i>What happened?</i>

231
00:15:59,459 --> 00:16:03,100
Mom, it's all lies. Don't care about it.

232
00:16:03,100 --> 00:16:06,119
<i>Why do they smear you?</i>

233
00:16:06,119 --> 00:16:08,060
It's a long story.

234
00:16:08,060 --> 00:16:10,960
<i>Is Lu really your president?</i>

235
00:16:12,496 --> 00:16:15,919
<i>Did you stay at Taoyuan Village for half a year?</i>

236
00:16:17,619 --> 00:16:19,100
Yes.

237
00:16:19,100 --> 00:16:22,479
<i>Why didn't you tell me? How can you lie to me?</i>

238
00:16:22,479 --> 00:16:26,220
<i>What is true and what is false in the news?</i>

239
00:16:26,220 --> 00:16:28,560
I didn't want to worry you.

240
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:32,359
<i>I'm more worried when you are so vague and don't make it clear.</i>

241
00:16:32,359 --> 00:16:34,750
Do you also think I'm such a person?

242
00:16:34,750 --> 00:16:36,559
<i>I know you aren't, of course.</i>

243
00:16:36,559 --> 00:16:39,459
<i>I'm afraid you will be wronged.</i>

244
00:16:39,459 --> 00:16:42,519
<i>Lanlan, be honest with me.</i>

245
00:16:42,519 --> 00:16:44,740
<i>Does Lu really like you?</i>

246
00:16:44,740 --> 00:16:46,780
<i>Does he pressure you?</i>

247
00:16:46,780 --> 00:16:49,119
<i>Is he serious?</i>

248
00:16:50,019 --> 00:16:54,019
Mom, don't worry.

249
00:16:54,019 --> 00:16:58,140
He does like me and is nice to me.

250
00:16:58,140 --> 00:17:00,599
I like him as well.

251
00:17:01,300 --> 00:17:03,579
It's not because his family is decent,

252
00:17:03,579 --> 00:17:06,619
nor for he is the president.

253
00:17:06,619 --> 00:17:08,059
<i>I understand,</i>

254
00:17:08,059 --> 00:17:10,180
<i>and I have a bottom line.</i>

255
00:17:10,180 --> 00:17:12,378
<i>If an acquaintance sees it or gossips about you,</i>

256
00:17:12,378 --> 00:17:14,500
<i>I'll fight back.</i>

257
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:19,520
Mom, next month I'll go back with Lu Zhaoxi

258
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:21,439
to explain it to you.

259
00:17:21,439 --> 00:17:24,179
<i>All right. You go and do your work.</i>

260
00:17:24,179 --> 00:17:26,100
Mom, bye.

261
00:17:34,420 --> 00:17:36,500
Why're you here?

262
00:17:39,219 --> 00:17:41,359
You said you'd phone your mom.

263
00:17:41,359 --> 00:17:44,711
I'm here to see if I needed to explain to her.

264
00:17:46,379 --> 00:17:48,079
No need.

265
00:17:48,739 --> 00:17:51,140
I just made it clear.

266
00:17:51,140 --> 00:17:54,760
I heard it just now. Well done.

267
00:17:56,660 --> 00:18:00,419
See? It's not that hard to explain.

268
00:18:00,419 --> 00:18:03,140
Auntie is very reasonable.

269
00:18:05,499 --> 00:18:08,480
Maybe it's my own fault.

270
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:12,439
I can't help being afraid.

271
00:18:13,019 --> 00:18:14,880
Afraid of what?

272
00:18:17,379 --> 00:18:22,040
I've never told anyone about this.

273
00:18:25,480 --> 00:18:28,039
After my dad passed away,

274
00:18:29,979 --> 00:18:35,939
I saw by chance my mom's suicide note in which...

275
00:18:38,540 --> 00:18:40,479
she said...

276
00:18:42,300 --> 00:18:47,939
life was so hard and tiring.

277
00:18:51,180 --> 00:18:53,859
I put it back as if untouched.

278
00:18:53,859 --> 00:18:56,620
She hasn't found out yet.

279
00:18:58,859 --> 00:19:03,960
I don't know why she gave up after that,

280
00:19:05,019 --> 00:19:07,459
but I told myself...

281
00:19:08,979 --> 00:19:12,119
I can't give her any more trouble...

282
00:19:13,399 --> 00:19:15,130
otherwise...

283
00:19:19,130 --> 00:19:22,210
I'd even lose my mom.

284
00:19:29,859 --> 00:19:34,140
Later she got remarried...

285
00:19:34,833 --> 00:19:36,950
and had another child.

286
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:45,100
Our house couldn't afford all of us, so I offered to go to a boarding house when I was in junior high school,

287
00:19:45,100 --> 00:19:50,400
and I worked hard to earn living expenses just to lighten her burden a little.

288
00:19:51,900 --> 00:19:58,200
Later, my mother worried that I would not live well outside alone,

289
00:19:58,200 --> 00:20:04,800
that's why I lie over and over again about having a boyfriend.

290
00:20:06,399 --> 00:20:08,560
I just hope...

291
00:20:09,339 --> 00:20:15,060
she can live an easier life, and enjoy it...

292
00:20:16,619 --> 00:20:18,900
unlike my dad.

293
00:20:35,219 --> 00:20:39,819
I can tell for sure Auntie loves you so much.

294
00:20:40,940 --> 00:20:45,859
She must have chosen to give up because she couldn't let go of you.

295
00:20:46,540 --> 00:20:49,239
And you're not her burden at all,

296
00:20:49,900 --> 00:20:53,200
but the courage for her to live.

297
00:20:55,820 --> 00:20:58,000
Is that so?

298
00:20:58,619 --> 00:21:00,599
It must be.

299
00:21:01,219 --> 00:21:04,740
Please don't be afraid anymore.

300
00:21:06,700 --> 00:21:08,760
Aren't I still here?

301
00:21:11,019 --> 00:21:15,639
I feel at ease with you.

302
00:21:26,020 --> 00:21:27,740
<i>[Dad]</i>

303
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:31,179
Hello, Dad, what's up?

304
00:21:32,639 --> 00:21:34,880
You have a stomachache?

305
00:21:35,499 --> 00:21:38,659
I told you not to have street food. Your stomach is weak.

306
00:21:38,659 --> 00:21:40,439
Now you...

307
00:21:46,404 --> 00:21:48,560
When is your business trip?

308
00:21:49,300 --> 00:21:53,378
All right. Let Secretary Chen send me the information.

309
00:21:54,420 --> 00:21:56,400
Pay attention to your body.

310
00:21:58,139 --> 00:22:02,239
What's up? He has a stomachache?

311
00:22:02,239 --> 00:22:04,714
It's said he has to take medicine for a few days.

312
00:22:04,714 --> 00:22:06,899
He is having me replace him on the business trip.

313
00:22:06,899 --> 00:22:08,620
When?

314
00:22:08,620 --> 00:22:12,379
Tonight. And it will take several days.

315
00:22:15,420 --> 00:22:18,319
Was it another harassing phone call just now?

316
00:22:18,820 --> 00:22:20,580
Maybe.

317
00:22:20,580 --> 00:22:23,600
Let me buy you another SIM card.

318
00:22:33,900 --> 00:22:41,100
Use this new phone number for online shopping and phone numbers reserved for patients.

319
00:22:41,100 --> 00:22:43,079
I think so.

320
00:22:43,079 --> 00:22:45,618
Well, I'm going on a business trip.

321
00:22:45,618 --> 00:22:47,240
Will you miss me?

322
00:22:48,060 --> 00:22:51,419
- Maybe?
- Maybe?

323
00:22:51,419 --> 00:22:54,618
I've never been separated from you for over 24 hours,

324
00:22:54,618 --> 00:22:57,460
so I don't know.

325
00:22:58,560 --> 00:23:03,279
Then, will you suddenly find that it is better to be single these days?

326
00:23:04,540 --> 00:23:07,739
I think you can try.

327
00:23:07,739 --> 00:23:08,919
I don't need it.

328
00:23:08,919 --> 00:23:11,440
Now I'm already missing you.

329
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:16,959
Do you want to go home and pack your luggage?

330
00:23:16,959 --> 00:23:19,471
I'll buy necessities this afternoon first.

331
00:23:19,471 --> 00:23:21,219
I'll take the afternoon off to accompany you,

332
00:23:21,219 --> 00:23:23,140
and see you off at the airport.

333
00:23:23,140 --> 00:23:24,113
Great.

334
00:23:24,113 --> 00:23:26,320
I just want more time with you.

335
00:23:32,560 --> 00:23:33,919
Thanks.

336
00:23:34,940 --> 00:23:36,440
Thanks.

337
00:23:51,640 --> 00:23:53,460
Hello, Secretary Chen.

338
00:23:54,759 --> 00:23:59,369
Okay, I'll read the information first, and I'll ask you if there's anything I don't understand.

339
00:23:59,369 --> 00:24:00,800
Thanks.

340
00:24:03,653 --> 00:24:06,440
Mind your work. I'll pack it for you.

341
00:24:07,040 --> 00:24:08,379
Okay.

342
00:24:16,379 --> 00:24:17,551
I'm coming.

343
00:24:17,551 --> 00:24:20,102
It should be the necessities you ordered.

344
00:24:20,102 --> 00:24:21,900
It should be.

345
00:24:24,820 --> 00:24:28,438
Everything you need on the business trip, I'll put them in a box for you.

346
00:24:30,339 --> 00:24:31,619
Let me do it.

347
00:24:31,619 --> 00:24:33,319
Just tell me what to do.

348
00:24:33,319 --> 00:24:35,580
I'm afraid you'll mix them up.

349
00:24:35,580 --> 00:24:37,700
I'm not a fool.

350
00:24:37,700 --> 00:24:41,136
I've memorized all the things you need on a business trip.

351
00:24:48,979 --> 00:24:50,580
Let go.

352
00:25:05,580 --> 00:25:07,600
This is not for the business trip.

353
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:11,438
There's a marketing campaign for every hundred-yuan order.

354
00:25:11,439 --> 00:25:13,360
I just added it in.

355
00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:14,979
It's for free.

356
00:25:16,239 --> 00:25:17,339
Really?

357
00:25:17,339 --> 00:25:18,722
Of course.

358
00:25:18,722 --> 00:25:20,571
I'll show you the receipt.

359
00:25:23,719 --> 00:25:25,550
Why is there no receipt?

360
00:25:25,551 --> 00:25:27,706
I'll complain about them.

361
00:25:27,706 --> 00:25:29,680
Check the receipt online.

362
00:25:29,680 --> 00:25:31,700
That's it.

363
00:25:31,700 --> 00:25:34,079
Let me find it for you.

364
00:25:34,079 --> 00:25:35,984
Forget it, I don't want to know.

365
00:25:35,985 --> 00:25:38,136
Whether it's bought or for free,

366
00:25:38,136 --> 00:25:40,959
you'll use it sooner or later.

367
00:25:40,959 --> 00:25:43,370
Let me put it on your nightstand.

368
00:26:20,911 --> 00:26:22,700
Hello, Assistant Lin.

369
00:26:22,700 --> 00:26:24,562
I'm downstairs at the president's house.

370
00:26:24,562 --> 00:26:26,239
Is there a problem?

371
00:26:28,440 --> 00:26:30,460
Chairman Lu wants to see me?

372
00:26:38,800 --> 00:26:41,400
- You, please.
- Chairman Lu.

373
00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:44,020
You're here. Take a seat.

374
00:26:49,920 --> 00:26:51,900
Have some hot tea.

375
00:26:51,900 --> 00:26:54,318
The tea here isn't bad.

376
00:26:54,319 --> 00:26:55,639
Thank you.

377
00:26:56,219 --> 00:26:59,279
Now don't take me as Chairman Lu,

378
00:26:59,279 --> 00:27:02,600
but Lu Zhaoxi's father.

379
00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:06,019
Do you feel better now?

380
00:27:07,499 --> 00:27:10,139
I don't have a stomachache at all.

381
00:27:12,180 --> 00:27:16,039
Do you know why I asked Assistant Lin to call you?

382
00:27:17,099 --> 00:27:18,600
No, I don't.

383
00:27:19,214 --> 00:27:21,635
Come on, have a taste.

384
00:27:26,139 --> 00:27:31,000
I assigned Lu Zhaoxi as the president

385
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:35,100
since I wanted to test and temper him.

386
00:27:35,100 --> 00:27:38,299
The environment in which he grew up is really great.

387
00:27:38,299 --> 00:27:41,160
It's been smooth sailing along the way.

388
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:47,500
I'm worried that he won't understand the complexity of people and society deeply enough in the future,

389
00:27:47,560 --> 00:27:50,740
and his vigilance against failure will not be high enough.

390
00:27:50,740 --> 00:27:54,920
So I ask Assistant Lin to report to me from time to time,

391
00:27:54,920 --> 00:27:58,960
and see how he thinks and how he solves problems.

392
00:28:00,139 --> 00:28:04,399
So I can't tell him that you called me here?

393
00:28:06,300 --> 00:28:10,259
Did Lu Zhaoxi tell you the purpose of being the president?

394
00:28:10,259 --> 00:28:14,839
Yes, he said it's mainly because of President Gao.

395
00:28:16,060 --> 00:28:18,860
Then I won't explain that much.

396
00:28:18,860 --> 00:28:21,300
You shouldn't have been involved.

397
00:28:21,300 --> 00:28:23,479
You're innocent.

398
00:28:23,479 --> 00:28:26,279
Luckily, I heard you had a strong heart.

399
00:28:26,979 --> 00:28:29,740
I'm used to worrying about the future,

400
00:28:29,740 --> 00:28:33,380
and I'm more calm when things happen.

401
00:28:33,380 --> 00:28:36,139
But this matter is not over yet.

402
00:28:36,139 --> 00:28:38,680
If I didn't take action,

403
00:28:38,680 --> 00:28:42,760
there is a high probability that Gao Xuan will make another wave of revelations.

404
00:28:42,760 --> 00:28:45,820
Then your family may even be involved.

405
00:28:46,820 --> 00:28:51,159
I heard from Assistant Lin today you received harassing phone calls.

406
00:28:54,219 --> 00:28:57,980
I don't want such things to happen to your family.

407
00:28:58,700 --> 00:29:06,800
Including your father's suicide may be discussed and over-interpreted as someone's after-dinner gossip.

408
00:29:07,480 --> 00:29:12,419
So, I have to separate you from this dilemma first.

409
00:29:12,420 --> 00:29:14,340
I need your cooperation.

410
00:29:15,139 --> 00:29:16,919
What shall I do?

411
00:29:16,919 --> 00:29:18,940
Break up with Lu Zhaoxi.

412
00:29:20,319 --> 00:29:21,800
Break up?

413
00:29:21,800 --> 00:29:23,520
Don't misunderstand.

414
00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:25,139
Pretend to.

415
00:29:25,139 --> 00:29:27,759
Just to make Gao Xuan believe it.

416
00:29:27,759 --> 00:29:30,219
You're not Gao Xuan's target at all.

417
00:29:30,219 --> 00:29:32,679
As long as you've nothing to do with Lu Zhaoxi,

418
00:29:32,680 --> 00:29:34,919
he won't trouble you.

419
00:29:36,300 --> 00:29:40,580
Can't I let Lu Zhaoxi know this?

420
00:29:41,219 --> 00:29:43,799
He won't agree.

421
00:29:43,799 --> 00:29:48,519
And he's so sensitive about your relationship.

422
00:29:48,519 --> 00:29:50,665
It would be easy to be noticed by Gao Xuan.

423
00:29:50,666 --> 00:29:53,348
So I entrusted him with a business trip on purpose.

424
00:29:53,348 --> 00:29:55,539
I hope you can hide it from him for a few days.

425
00:29:55,539 --> 00:29:59,660
Assistant Lin should make some progress soon.

426
00:29:59,660 --> 00:30:03,460
After he comes back from a business trip, I'll explain it to him.

427
00:30:06,219 --> 00:30:08,780
What shall I do in detail?

428
00:30:09,660 --> 00:30:12,600
Did you agree with Lu Zhaoxi's dad?

429
00:30:12,600 --> 00:30:14,839
I think he's right.

430
00:30:14,839 --> 00:30:19,459
There's no stronger evidence for a breakup than my leaving.

431
00:30:19,459 --> 00:30:22,532
The documentary's about to be filmed at the Department of Pediatrics.

432
00:30:22,532 --> 00:30:25,691
I'm neither fit to show up nor have a schedule.

433
00:30:25,691 --> 00:30:28,910
I've things to do in Taoyuan Village.

434
00:30:28,910 --> 00:30:30,799
Must you break up?

435
00:30:30,800 --> 00:30:33,838
It's not a breakup. Just pretending.

436
00:30:34,859 --> 00:30:39,499
This is definitely the best plan after his father's comprehensive consideration.

437
00:30:39,499 --> 00:30:41,378
A fake breakup is okay,

438
00:30:41,378 --> 00:30:44,299
but the key is you have to hide it from Lu Zhaoxi.

439
00:30:44,299 --> 00:30:47,919
But that's what his dad asked for.

440
00:30:47,919 --> 00:30:49,919
I can't object to it.

441
00:30:52,060 --> 00:30:54,639
How about you secretly tell Lu Zhaoxi?

442
00:30:54,640 --> 00:30:56,659
I can't.

443
00:30:56,659 --> 00:31:01,300
What if his dad finds out? I'll be someone who breaks her word.

444
00:31:01,300 --> 00:31:02,699
That's it.

445
00:31:02,699 --> 00:31:05,259
He is your future father-in-law after all.

446
00:31:06,460 --> 00:31:07,779
I'm so sad.

447
00:31:07,779 --> 00:31:09,639
Don't tease me.

448
00:31:10,300 --> 00:31:11,999
Isn't that what you are worried about?

449
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:13,860
Don't tell anyone.

450
00:31:13,860 --> 00:31:17,160
Stop being pissy. Enlighten me quickly.

451
00:31:20,379 --> 00:31:21,859
Let me tell you.

452
00:31:21,859 --> 00:31:25,519
These problems are not actually problems.

453
00:31:25,519 --> 00:31:27,139
Not a problem?

454
00:31:27,139 --> 00:31:30,440
- Do you have confidence in your love?
- Yes, I do.

455
00:31:30,440 --> 00:31:36,120
So as long as you have love, all problems are not problems.

456
00:31:36,120 --> 00:31:37,979
Are you writing a novel?

457
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:42,800
No, think about it. You are just worried that Lu Zhaoxi might be angry with you. Right?

458
00:31:44,580 --> 00:31:46,899
But it's his father's idea.

459
00:31:46,899 --> 00:31:49,059
You are nothing more than a passive enforcer.

460
00:31:49,059 --> 00:31:51,419
But after all, I'm lying to him.

461
00:31:51,419 --> 00:31:53,900
Okay, let's take a step back.

462
00:31:53,900 --> 00:31:56,575
If Lu Zhaoxi is really angry with you,

463
00:31:56,575 --> 00:31:59,080
are you confident of changing his mind?

464
00:32:01,820 --> 00:32:03,379
I don't know.

465
00:32:04,319 --> 00:32:05,979
How can't you know?

466
00:32:05,979 --> 00:32:08,138
You have to have confidence in your charms,

467
00:32:08,138 --> 00:32:10,460
in Lu Zhaoxi's love for you,

468
00:32:11,820 --> 00:32:13,859
and faith in me, too.

469
00:32:15,660 --> 00:32:17,579
Have faith in you?

470
00:32:17,579 --> 00:32:20,900
I will provide you with professional technical guidance.

471
00:32:22,660 --> 00:32:25,599
Then I still have confidence in the first two.

472
00:32:25,599 --> 00:32:27,459
Don't think I've no experience.

473
00:32:27,459 --> 00:32:29,879
It was Lin Kaiwen's advice that

474
00:32:29,880 --> 00:32:32,200
made you realize your love for him.

475
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:35,059
He's just an apprentice of mine.

476
00:32:35,059 --> 00:32:40,219
As the master, it'll just be a piece of cake.

477
00:32:44,420 --> 00:32:48,258
Since I have no other choice but to have confidence.

478
00:32:48,258 --> 00:32:50,338
That's it. Take it easy.

479
00:32:50,338 --> 00:32:53,019
Just a tiny challenge to love.

480
00:33:17,860 --> 00:33:23,480
<i>[Ye Shilan]</i>

481
00:33:33,780 --> 00:33:36,060
Why are you up so late?

482
00:33:36,060 --> 00:33:37,600
I'll go to bed soon.

483
00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:39,440
Just showered?

484
00:33:40,479 --> 00:33:42,018
<i>I'm going to start going to the countryside tomorrow.</i>

485
00:33:42,018 --> 00:33:43,645
<i>With many meetings to attend,</i>

486
00:33:43,645 --> 00:33:45,379
<i>I won't have that much time to talk to you.</i>

487
00:33:45,379 --> 00:33:48,559
It's okay. You are busy with work.

488
00:33:49,880 --> 00:33:53,220
Next time, let's find a place to travel.

489
00:33:53,220 --> 00:33:55,580
Is there any place you want to go in particular?

490
00:33:58,580 --> 00:34:01,660
I want to watch the flag-raising ceremony at Tian'anmen,

491
00:34:01,660 --> 00:34:04,080
and climb the Great Wall.

492
00:34:04,979 --> 00:34:06,759
<i>So classic.</i>

493
00:34:06,759 --> 00:34:09,979
It was my dad's dream, but he failed.

494
00:34:09,979 --> 00:34:12,419
Okay, I'll go with you.

495
00:34:12,419 --> 00:34:14,980
Deal. No regrets.

496
00:34:15,639 --> 00:34:18,339
When did my words count?

497
00:34:21,420 --> 00:34:27,359
Then... can you love me forever?

498
00:34:30,372 --> 00:34:31,839
I can. Do you believe me?

499
00:34:31,840 --> 00:34:32,979
<i>Yes, I do.</i>

500
00:34:32,979 --> 00:34:35,419
Since when have you become so childlike?

501
00:34:35,419 --> 00:34:38,199
Just tell me.

502
00:34:40,579 --> 00:34:43,519
How about you try being coquettish again?

503
00:34:45,339 --> 00:34:46,740
Okay.

504
00:34:47,959 --> 00:34:52,119
Handsome, can you?

505
00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:56,039
I can.

506
00:34:56,039 --> 00:34:58,580
Okay, that's a deal.

507
00:34:58,580 --> 00:35:01,779
Why are you so strange today?

508
00:35:01,779 --> 00:35:03,220
How is that?

509
00:35:04,779 --> 00:35:06,360
It's getting late.

510
00:35:06,360 --> 00:35:09,478
I'm going to bed. You should rest early.

511
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:14,060
Okay, I'll sleep early.

512
00:35:14,060 --> 00:35:15,360
<i>Good night.</i>

513
00:35:34,580 --> 00:35:38,099
<i>[Outpatient]</i>

514
00:35:38,100 --> 00:35:40,140
<i>[Medical Aid Application Form]</i>

515
00:35:44,159 --> 00:35:49,079
Ye, You are going to Taoyuan Village for medical assistance?

516
00:35:51,370 --> 00:35:52,979
Did President ask you to?

517
00:35:52,979 --> 00:35:56,499
No, it's my idea.

518
00:35:56,499 --> 00:35:59,639
Is it because of things online?

519
00:35:59,639 --> 00:36:02,920
The group has stopped my shift schedule.

520
00:36:03,700 --> 00:36:06,300
I've nothing to do here.

521
00:36:08,260 --> 00:36:11,759
Does President agree?

522
00:36:12,660 --> 00:36:14,360
We...

523
00:36:16,579 --> 00:36:18,400
We broke up.

524
00:36:19,579 --> 00:36:21,700
Broke up?

525
00:36:21,700 --> 00:36:25,620
For such a trifle thing, you broke up?

526
00:36:25,620 --> 00:36:28,239
Those online are just rumors,

527
00:36:28,239 --> 00:36:31,179
but it's no small matter for us.

528
00:36:31,179 --> 00:36:33,460
Our hospital's reputation is suffering.

529
00:36:33,460 --> 00:36:35,400
President is under a lot of pressure.

530
00:36:36,339 --> 00:36:39,919
I can't feel at ease seeing this.

531
00:36:39,919 --> 00:36:42,640
Some things are true.

532
00:36:42,640 --> 00:36:44,880
As the netizens said,

533
00:36:45,759 --> 00:36:48,703
there's a huge gap between President and me.

534
00:36:48,703 --> 00:36:52,379
We'll have more disputes in the future.

535
00:36:53,987 --> 00:36:56,394
It's better for us to break up early.

536
00:36:59,099 --> 00:37:02,819
I'm sorry. Did I say too much?

537
00:37:02,819 --> 00:37:04,338
Not at all.

538
00:37:04,338 --> 00:37:08,059
I just feel it's a pity.

539
00:37:09,740 --> 00:37:12,279
Well,

540
00:37:12,279 --> 00:37:15,479
how about I think about it?

541
00:37:15,479 --> 00:37:16,811
You go back first.

542
00:37:16,811 --> 00:37:18,940
I'll reply to you later.

543
00:37:18,940 --> 00:37:20,339
Okay.

544
00:37:35,779 --> 00:37:37,679
Hi, President Gao.

545
00:37:37,679 --> 00:37:40,660
- Is President here?
- He's on a business trip.

546
00:37:56,580 --> 00:37:58,260
<i>[Vice President Gao]</i>

547
00:38:01,400 --> 00:38:06,420
<i>[Vice President's Office]</i>

548
00:38:10,679 --> 00:38:12,380
Come in.

549
00:38:12,380 --> 00:38:14,819
President Gao, were you looking for me?

550
00:38:15,560 --> 00:38:17,579
Assistant Lin, sit down please.

551
00:38:17,579 --> 00:38:18,959
Okay.

552
00:38:24,211 --> 00:38:25,400
<i>[Vice President's Office]</i>

553
00:38:28,669 --> 00:38:30,059
Is President Lu on a business trip?

554
00:38:30,059 --> 00:38:32,759
Yes, he set off last night.

555
00:38:32,759 --> 00:38:34,701
It's said that Chairman Lu has a bad stomach,

556
00:38:34,701 --> 00:38:39,041
so he in place of Chairman Lu paid a field trip to an investment project.

557
00:38:39,059 --> 00:38:40,736
It may take a few days.

558
00:38:40,737 --> 00:38:44,095
I just notified the staff not to bother the president.

559
00:38:44,096 --> 00:38:46,980
If they needed anything, they were to contact you or Associate Dean Xu.

560
00:38:49,619 --> 00:38:51,940
Are you looking for the president for something?

561
00:38:53,159 --> 00:38:54,740
That's right.

562
00:38:54,740 --> 00:38:58,160
Dr. Ye just submitted her application.

563
00:38:58,160 --> 00:38:59,899
She said she broke up with the president,

564
00:38:59,899 --> 00:39:02,519
and is going to Taoyuan Village for medical assistance.

565
00:39:02,519 --> 00:39:07,860
You said it's not for me to decide on my own, right?

566
00:39:07,860 --> 00:39:09,959
Do you know what's going on?

567
00:39:09,959 --> 00:39:13,260
I don't know, but I guessed it would be like this.

568
00:39:14,539 --> 00:39:16,760
How come?

569
00:39:16,760 --> 00:39:20,479
Chairman Lu must know that someone wants to use public opinion to drive the president out.

570
00:39:20,479 --> 00:39:22,246
But it's not exactly a big deal.

571
00:39:22,246 --> 00:39:24,907
Using Chairman Lu's tricks to make the president break up

572
00:39:24,907 --> 00:39:28,069
is the easiest and most effective way to quell the controversy.

573
00:39:28,980 --> 00:39:32,399
This is so unexpected.

574
00:39:32,399 --> 00:39:35,900
He wanted Lu Zhaoxi to hang on to his position.

575
00:39:35,900 --> 00:39:38,330
Do you expect the president to leave?

576
00:39:40,420 --> 00:39:44,439
Assistant Lin, what do you mean?

577
00:39:44,439 --> 00:39:48,640
You have always taken care of me and I want to help you, too.

578
00:39:49,779 --> 00:39:53,899
Has Lu Zhaoxi treated you badly?

579
00:39:53,899 --> 00:39:58,620
No, but I know I can get more by following you.

580
00:40:00,099 --> 00:40:02,540
I knew I was right about you

581
00:40:02,540 --> 00:40:05,719
Young people have to be as ambitious as you.

582
00:40:05,719 --> 00:40:09,760
Tell me what you have in your hands.

583
00:40:10,539 --> 00:40:14,379
Do you remember President donated a B-ultrasonic machine

584
00:40:14,379 --> 00:40:18,180
- and some medicine to Taoyuan Village?
- I know.

585
00:40:18,180 --> 00:40:20,690
The audit team hasn't left yet.

586
00:40:20,690 --> 00:40:24,520
You may wish to suggest that they check this account.

587
00:40:48,299 --> 00:40:50,660
- Assistant Lin.
- Dr. Ye,

588
00:40:50,660 --> 00:40:52,799
sorry to keep you waiting.

589
00:40:52,800 --> 00:40:54,700
The meeting just ended.

590
00:40:54,700 --> 00:40:57,659
Never mind. I've no work now.

591
00:40:57,659 --> 00:40:59,259
I've persuaded President Gao.

592
00:40:59,259 --> 00:41:02,450
He'll just send a doctor to follow up on the free clinic.

593
00:41:02,450 --> 00:41:03,779
He'll leave it to you.

594
00:41:03,779 --> 00:41:06,180
Tomorrow morning you may leave for Taoyuan Village.

595
00:41:06,180 --> 00:41:07,618
Tomorrow?

596
00:41:07,618 --> 00:41:10,298
If you stay one more day, you'll act one more day.

597
00:41:10,298 --> 00:41:13,110
It's more credible to leave with no message.

598
00:41:14,740 --> 00:41:17,858
The president won't know about this from other places, will he?

599
00:41:17,858 --> 00:41:21,419
Don't worry. I've told all people concerned.

600
00:41:24,559 --> 00:41:26,319
Is it too cruel of us to hide it from him?

601
00:41:26,320 --> 00:41:29,720
At this time, you must be resolute.

602
00:41:30,699 --> 00:41:36,060
Assistant Lin, don't you feel guilty lying to him all the time?

603
00:41:36,060 --> 00:41:38,860
Not at all. He's not the only one who getting lied to.

604
00:41:38,860 --> 00:41:40,550
I'm numb now.
