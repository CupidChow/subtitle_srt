16
00:01:31,419 --> 00:01:32,720
Fine.

17
00:01:33,779 --> 00:01:36,580
I'll satisfy you today.

18
00:01:36,580 --> 00:01:38,820
What do you want to know?

19
00:01:38,820 --> 00:01:41,360
- Something exciting.
- Something exciting?

20
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:50,759
Don't do that. It's just the two of us in this room.

21
00:01:50,759 --> 00:01:51,998
Do you want to hear it or not?

22
00:01:51,998 --> 00:01:54,040
Yes!

23
00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:55,540
Come here.

24
00:02:00,900 --> 00:02:02,880
You kissed?

25
00:02:05,080 --> 00:02:06,619
Not a kiss.

26
00:02:06,620 --> 00:02:11,700
Our lips... touched each other... by accident.

27
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:15,799
Oh, I see. Lips accidentally touched.

28
00:02:15,799 --> 00:02:19,020
Your lips accidentally touched?

29
00:02:19,020 --> 00:02:21,859
There was a soccer ball flying toward us.

30
00:02:21,859 --> 00:02:23,319
It just hit his head...

31
00:02:23,320 --> 00:02:24,640
Oh, come on!

32
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:26,360
I only know is that your lips touched.

33
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:28,300
A forced kiss.

34
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:31,220
Fine.

35
00:02:32,199 --> 00:02:34,300
We did kiss.

36
00:02:34,300 --> 00:02:36,478
That's it. Just admit it.

37
00:02:36,479 --> 00:02:41,760
In idol dramas or novels, when love comes,

38
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:44,080
no matter what whimsical things happen,

39
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:45,799
your mouths will be attracted to stick together

40
00:02:45,799 --> 00:02:47,899
just like magnets.

41
00:02:47,899 --> 00:02:50,420
Things are different.

42
00:02:50,420 --> 00:02:53,420
I have confidence in you two again.

43
00:02:54,980 --> 00:02:57,059
Your mom took photos for you?

44
00:02:57,059 --> 00:02:58,560
Let me see.

45
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:00,240
Yes, she did.

46
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:02,959
I'll let him send them to me.

47
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:04,720
My mom wants to see the photos.

48
00:03:07,639 --> 00:03:09,860
Her mom is satisfied with me.

49
00:03:09,860 --> 00:03:11,458
She expects to see us together.

50
00:03:11,458 --> 00:03:13,660
This makes me more guilty.

51
00:03:13,660 --> 00:03:16,478
Deceived her and made her happy at the same time.

52
00:03:16,479 --> 00:03:20,638
<i>So why don't you try to be with her?</i>

53
00:03:20,639 --> 00:03:22,239
<i>Then you have deceived nobody.</i>

54
00:03:22,300 --> 00:03:25,600
She likes someone and can't forget him.

55
00:03:25,639 --> 00:03:27,029
<i>That's good.</i>

56
00:03:27,130 --> 00:03:28,980
<i>You can help her forget him.</i>

57
00:03:28,980 --> 00:03:30,198
Things are different, Mom.

58
00:03:30,199 --> 00:03:31,920
We're only friends.

59
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:35,220
Forget it. I have to take a shower now.

60
00:03:35,220 --> 00:03:36,440
Bye.

61
00:03:40,659 --> 00:03:43,240
<i>President, thank you so much today.</i>

62
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:45,760
<i>Please send me the pictures.</i>

63
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:05,100
When did she delete it secretly?

64
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:17,620
<i>Thanks.</i>

65
00:04:17,620 --> 00:04:20,200
<i>You can delete them now.</i>

66
00:04:25,060 --> 00:04:26,258
<i>Ye Shilan,</i>

67
00:04:26,258 --> 00:04:29,400
<i>you kicked down the ladder too quickly.</i>

68
00:04:35,299 --> 00:04:37,140
<i>It's good for you.</i>

69
00:04:37,140 --> 00:04:40,760
<i>In case you can't explain it to your future girlfriend.</i>

70
00:04:48,859 --> 00:04:52,000
<i>You're really a thoughtful girl.</i>

71
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,600
Have you received the photos?

72
00:04:54,220 --> 00:04:56,200
Why are you chatting with him?

73
00:04:56,200 --> 00:04:58,040
Here they are.

74
00:04:58,040 --> 00:04:59,540
Do you want to see them?

75
00:05:03,620 --> 00:05:06,320
It should be a successful date.

76
00:05:07,220 --> 00:05:09,400
Well-matched.

77
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:12,760
Your smiles are natural.

78
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,960
Where's your kissing picture?

79
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:23,520
Not a kiss.

80
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:25,000
A lip touch.

81
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,919
Well... Where is it?

82
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:29,860
Sounds weird.

83
00:05:29,860 --> 00:05:34,260
That picture... I already deleted it on his phone.

84
00:05:34,260 --> 00:05:36,240
Deleted?

85
00:05:37,940 --> 00:05:39,660
Why?

86
00:05:39,660 --> 00:05:43,600
I don't think we should keep it.

87
00:05:47,399 --> 00:05:51,760
So what was his reaction after it?

88
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:52,879
He felt dizzy.

89
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:55,399
Obviously! He was hit by a ball!

90
00:05:55,399 --> 00:05:57,020
And then?

91
00:06:04,340 --> 00:06:08,300
<i>I just got hit on the head.</i>

92
00:06:08,300 --> 00:06:10,080
<i>I know.</i>

93
00:06:10,799 --> 00:06:13,000
<i>Are you still dizzy?</i>

94
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,720
<i>Much better now.</i>

95
00:06:20,979 --> 00:06:22,800
<i>Why is it bleeding?</i>

96
00:06:23,540 --> 00:06:25,220
<i>Let me see.</i>

97
00:06:29,220 --> 00:06:31,140
<i>Silly girl.</i>

98
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:33,719
No reaction.

99
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:36,680
He was quite sober and played a trick on me.

100
00:07:04,100 --> 00:07:07,540
Besides, it doesn't matter.

101
00:07:07,540 --> 00:07:09,259
I asked him to do me a favor

102
00:07:09,260 --> 00:07:10,819
so he should have prepared for it.

103
00:07:10,819 --> 00:07:14,060
It's just a tiny accident.

104
00:07:16,839 --> 00:07:18,740
It shouldn't be like this...

105
00:07:26,079 --> 00:07:27,860
What is she doing now?

106
00:07:31,070 --> 00:07:32,780
What am I doing?

107
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:41,139
There should be two possibilities.

108
00:07:41,139 --> 00:07:44,460
First. He's a love master.

109
00:07:44,460 --> 00:07:48,120
A charming man always has had several girlfriends before.

110
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:50,880
Quite common.

111
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:52,460
Sounds reasonable.

112
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:17,980
What's the second?

113
00:08:17,980 --> 00:08:19,460
Second.

114
00:08:19,460 --> 00:08:21,738
He's a master of pretense.

115
00:08:21,738 --> 00:08:24,919
Though he looked calm, his heart was totally panicked.

116
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:26,620
He's afraid you'll find out,

117
00:08:26,620 --> 00:08:29,459
so he tried to cover it up with a joke.

118
00:08:29,459 --> 00:08:31,480
He even deceived himself.

119
00:08:42,719 --> 00:08:45,240
Why do I listen to her?

120
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:47,300
Why not leave it as proof?

121
00:09:02,459 --> 00:09:04,040
Little fool.

122
00:09:06,499 --> 00:09:10,080
If he's faking it,

123
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:12,380
I can't be anxious about it.

124
00:09:12,380 --> 00:09:16,540
I must be more calm and more indifferent than him.

125
00:09:16,540 --> 00:09:18,600
Are you upset?

126
00:09:19,540 --> 00:09:21,460
I'm just saying.

127
00:09:25,119 --> 00:09:27,800
Mom should have finished bathing. My turn now.

128
00:09:36,940 --> 00:09:39,979
Mom, shall I send you to the station?

129
00:09:39,979 --> 00:09:42,779
No, thanks. Don't waste your time on the way.

130
00:09:42,779 --> 00:09:44,299
Go back and have a rest.

131
00:09:44,299 --> 00:09:47,038
Tell me when you arrive.

132
00:09:47,039 --> 00:09:49,200
Okay. Don't worry.

133
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:52,780
How long do you still need to be the president's assistant?

134
00:09:52,780 --> 00:09:54,440
About two months.

135
00:09:55,340 --> 00:09:57,580
Is he easy-going?

136
00:09:58,490 --> 00:10:00,040
Not bad.

137
00:10:00,040 --> 00:10:01,640
That's fine.

138
00:10:04,459 --> 00:10:05,980
What's going on?

139
00:10:07,100 --> 00:10:08,660
This...

140
00:10:08,660 --> 00:10:09,839
Just keep it.

141
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:11,439
Why do you give it to me?

142
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:12,519
I don't need it.

143
00:10:12,520 --> 00:10:13,938
Password is your birthday.

144
00:10:13,938 --> 00:10:16,460
Use it when necessary.

145
00:10:16,460 --> 00:10:18,519
I have money. Take it yourself.

146
00:10:18,520 --> 00:10:22,700
I know. Just keep it for me. Okay?

147
00:10:22,700 --> 00:10:26,020
We can still make money now and the cost is not much.

148
00:10:26,020 --> 00:10:27,500
We don't need it now.

149
00:10:27,500 --> 00:10:30,618
As you're Lu's girlfriend and his condition is so nice...

150
00:10:30,618 --> 00:10:33,839
I can't help you with anything right now, so keep some money with you.

151
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:36,578
Have confidence in yourself. Keep your back straight.

152
00:10:36,578 --> 00:10:38,339
When it's time to be generous, be generous.

153
00:10:38,339 --> 00:10:40,420
Don't let anyone looks down on you.

154
00:10:40,420 --> 00:10:42,580
Time is up. I have to leave now.

155
00:10:48,100 --> 00:10:50,399
Mom, take care on the road.

156
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:51,419
I see. Don't worry.

157
00:10:51,419 --> 00:10:52,718
Go back home.

158
00:10:52,719 --> 00:10:53,999
Sir, let's go.

159
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,500
Okay.

160
00:10:56,180 --> 00:10:57,680
Take care!

161
00:11:20,170 --> 00:11:24,820
<i>[Outpatient]</i>

162
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:36,390
<i>[Complex Building]</i>

163
00:12:08,139 --> 00:12:10,580
- Good morning.
- Morning, President.

164
00:12:11,930 --> 00:12:13,258
Another flower?

165
00:12:13,258 --> 00:12:15,300
Daisy?

166
00:12:15,300 --> 00:12:16,840
What does it mean?

167
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:18,920
Nothing but pretty.

168
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:22,220
Are you tired of dealing with me now?

169
00:12:22,220 --> 00:12:24,420
Make one up.

170
00:12:26,450 --> 00:12:29,299
Four Gentlemen Among Flowers. It's to praise you.

171
00:12:29,299 --> 00:12:31,460
Or are you mocking me?

172
00:12:31,460 --> 00:12:33,180
Why do you think so?

173
00:12:33,180 --> 00:12:36,139
As we kissed, you thought I took advantage of you

174
00:12:36,139 --> 00:12:38,980
so you deleted the photo secretly.

175
00:12:38,980 --> 00:12:43,338
President, it sounds questionable.

176
00:12:44,220 --> 00:12:46,899
First. It was an accident.

177
00:12:46,899 --> 00:12:51,140
As men and women are equal,no one takes any advantage.

178
00:12:51,140 --> 00:12:56,080
Second. As for a doctor, the mouth is just an organ.

179
00:12:56,080 --> 00:12:58,800
It's just like my hand touching it at random.

180
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:02,759
All in all, it was just an accidental touch.

181
00:13:02,759 --> 00:13:04,760
No big deal.

182
00:13:04,760 --> 00:13:09,380
Eloquent. It looks like you were prepared.

183
00:13:09,380 --> 00:13:11,820
Then why did you delete it secretly?

184
00:13:11,820 --> 00:13:13,820
Not secretly.

185
00:13:13,820 --> 00:13:15,140
It was an accident.

186
00:13:15,140 --> 00:13:16,820
Really?

187
00:13:18,250 --> 00:13:21,940
Fine. You convinced me.

188
00:13:21,940 --> 00:13:25,058
Fortunately, it wasn't on purpose. It's retrievable.

189
00:13:25,058 --> 00:13:27,060
Do you want a copy?

190
00:13:52,839 --> 00:13:56,420
<i>You can treat me to lunch today.</i>

191
00:13:56,420 --> 00:13:59,520
<i>And buy me a cup of coffee after the meal.</i>

192
00:14:06,300 --> 00:14:08,520
Dr. Xu, Bed 18 wants to see you.

193
00:14:08,520 --> 00:14:10,220
I see.

194
00:14:19,220 --> 00:14:21,018
I've just learned something in the tea room.

195
00:14:21,018 --> 00:14:24,878
In this documentary, apart from the doctors who are working normally,

196
00:14:24,878 --> 00:14:28,580
our Pediatrics Department will also select three main doctors.

197
00:14:29,159 --> 00:14:30,458
What's the difference?

198
00:14:30,458 --> 00:14:33,099
They'll have their own storylines.

199
00:14:33,099 --> 00:14:36,960
Tailored and comprehensive illustration.

200
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:41,460
I see. With many scenes and interviews, right?

201
00:14:41,460 --> 00:14:43,498
That's it. Are you excited?

202
00:14:43,498 --> 00:14:44,818
It's none of our business.

203
00:14:44,818 --> 00:14:46,720
So many senior doctors are here.

204
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:49,700
Two from the seniors

205
00:14:49,700 --> 00:14:54,700
and the remaining one will be chosen among our group of young doctors.

206
00:14:54,700 --> 00:14:56,700
It still won't be my turn.

207
00:14:56,700 --> 00:15:00,180
I'm satisfied with just a scene.

208
00:15:00,180 --> 00:15:03,399
I heard the president would recommend the candidates to the producer in person.

209
00:15:03,399 --> 00:15:06,280
Who's the most likely?

210
00:15:07,259 --> 00:15:10,839
Dr. Zhong. Last time, he helped our president.

211
00:15:10,839 --> 00:15:13,679
I think it should be Dr. Jiang.

212
00:15:13,679 --> 00:15:17,018
Don't forget his relationship with Associate Dean Xu.

213
00:15:17,018 --> 00:15:21,319
Maybe he'll choose neither of them. Then you can get a bargain.

214
00:15:21,319 --> 00:15:22,740
Can you be serious?

215
00:15:22,740 --> 00:15:24,219
I'm not that bad, okay?

216
00:15:24,219 --> 00:15:26,440
What do you mean by "bargain"?

217
00:15:26,440 --> 00:15:29,420
I'm sorry. Please forgive me.

218
00:15:29,420 --> 00:15:33,260
However, we both have forgotten a strong competitor.

219
00:15:33,260 --> 00:15:35,640
Who?

220
00:15:35,640 --> 00:15:37,360
Dr. Ye.

221
00:15:38,300 --> 00:15:40,360
Dr. Ye?

222
00:15:43,300 --> 00:15:44,599
Call Ye Shilan here.

223
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:46,300
Yes.

224
00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:51,799
Assistant Ye, please come in.

225
00:15:51,799 --> 00:15:53,380
Okay.

226
00:16:02,640 --> 00:16:04,480
Sit down.

227
00:16:08,599 --> 00:16:12,058
We'll choose a young doctor from Pediatrics as one of the main figures.

228
00:16:12,058 --> 00:16:14,420
I want to know your opinion.

229
00:16:14,420 --> 00:16:17,340
Well... I don't know.

230
00:16:17,980 --> 00:16:20,419
Based on several aspects, such as medical ethics,

231
00:16:20,419 --> 00:16:22,500
personal image, expression, and adaptability.

232
00:16:22,500 --> 00:16:23,860
Consider it as a whole.

233
00:16:23,860 --> 00:16:26,240
Just tell me your most direct feelings.

234
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:28,940
I think they're all excellent

235
00:16:28,940 --> 00:16:32,760
and I'm not good at talking about others behind their backs.

236
00:16:32,760 --> 00:16:33,979
What about you?

237
00:16:33,979 --> 00:16:35,049
I can't.

238
00:16:35,049 --> 00:16:36,259
Why?

239
00:16:36,259 --> 00:16:39,400
Are you alone not excellent in Pediatrics?

240
00:16:40,019 --> 00:16:42,760
I also think she's a good choice.

241
00:16:43,259 --> 00:16:45,619
I'm now the president's assistant.

242
00:16:45,619 --> 00:16:50,179
If you choose me, others will question whether it's fair or not.

243
00:16:50,179 --> 00:16:53,139
Everyone will question the fairness of this decision, and they will also suspect that what happened to Chief Huang

244
00:16:53,139 --> 00:16:55,580
last time was because I was trying to please you.

245
00:16:55,580 --> 00:16:57,520
If so, Dr. Zhong also helped me.

246
00:16:57,520 --> 00:16:59,600
Is he not suitable?

247
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:02,040
I'm talking about myself.

248
00:17:02,819 --> 00:17:04,770
I'm kidding.

249
00:17:04,770 --> 00:17:07,339
I won't choose you.

250
00:17:07,339 --> 00:17:11,159
I told you to assist me to improve the hospital from the view of staff.

251
00:17:11,159 --> 00:17:14,040
So you'll have more chances to join such a discussion.

252
00:17:14,040 --> 00:17:16,580
Don't worry. It's classified.

253
00:17:16,580 --> 00:17:20,939
Okay. If it can help everyone, I'm happy to help.

254
00:17:21,900 --> 00:17:25,860
The current situation is that Dr. Zhong has refused.

255
00:17:25,860 --> 00:17:29,380
Then the appropriate candidates are Dr. Jiang and Dr. Zeng.

256
00:17:29,380 --> 00:17:34,240
Assistant Lin said you and Dr. Jiang were inducted together.

257
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:36,260
What do you think of him?

258
00:17:37,300 --> 00:17:40,640
Based on the previous conditions you said,

259
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:43,620
he has enough comprehensive capabilities.

260
00:17:45,490 --> 00:17:47,260
What about Dr. Zeng?

261
00:17:47,260 --> 00:17:50,700
Dr. Zeng... We have little contact.

262
00:17:50,700 --> 00:17:52,580
I don't know him well.

263
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:57,000
It seems you know Dr. Jiang well.

264
00:17:58,279 --> 00:18:00,820
Yes, a little more.

265
00:18:02,780 --> 00:18:04,729
Assistant Lin, what do you think?

266
00:18:04,729 --> 00:18:06,180
No preference.

267
00:18:06,180 --> 00:18:10,660
I just don't know if Dean Xu from Dr. Jiang's side will show up.

268
00:18:10,660 --> 00:18:12,638
What does this have to do with Dean Xu?

269
00:18:12,638 --> 00:18:14,020
Don't you know?

270
00:18:14,020 --> 00:18:18,360
Dr. Jiang's girlfriend, Xu Zhining, is President Xu's niece.

271
00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:24,640
Maybe it's because she's more familiar with one side.

272
00:18:25,300 --> 00:18:27,480
I'm a bit hungry. Let's eat first.

273
00:18:27,480 --> 00:18:30,080
Do you want to join us?

274
00:18:31,370 --> 00:18:33,580
With you two?

275
00:18:33,580 --> 00:18:35,320
Her treat.

276
00:18:37,259 --> 00:18:40,740
Then I'll eat myself. Enjoy your lunch.

277
00:18:56,130 --> 00:18:57,600
Here you are.

278
00:18:59,660 --> 00:19:01,340
Thank you.

279
00:19:08,300 --> 00:19:10,080
Why are you laughing?

280
00:19:11,720 --> 00:19:15,120
Why did Assistant Lin look so weird?

281
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:16,278
He's always like this.

282
00:19:16,278 --> 00:19:18,860
When talking about private affairs, his way of thinking is very mysterious.

283
00:19:18,860 --> 00:19:20,580
Mysterious?

284
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:24,819
For example. When he finds that we stayed together in private,

285
00:19:24,819 --> 00:19:28,840
he will think we've finally become lovers.

286
00:19:29,759 --> 00:19:32,840
But it's totally impossible.

287
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:37,539
I agree. We're more like brothers.

288
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:44,300
Don't lead me into the men's camp. I still want to find a boyfriend.

289
00:19:45,919 --> 00:19:48,620
<i>We're not from a rich family.</i>

290
00:19:48,620 --> 00:19:51,420
<i>Lanlan has been sensible since young.</i>

291
00:19:51,420 --> 00:19:53,079
<i>Two years after her father died,</i>

292
00:19:53,079 --> 00:19:56,860
<i>she went to boarding school when she was in junior high school.</i>

293
00:19:56,860 --> 00:20:00,780
<i>In fact, we spent very little time together.</i>

294
00:20:00,780 --> 00:20:02,900
<i>I read on the internet</i>

295
00:20:02,900 --> 00:20:10,900
<i>that girls who lack family care are prone to meeting bad men, and are deceived by sweet words.</i>

296
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:16,918
<i>As a mother, in fact, sometimes I think about it, worrying about Lanlan being hurt.</i>

297
00:20:16,918 --> 00:20:20,619
<i>She is very considerate and is afraid of me worrying.</i>

298
00:20:20,700 --> 00:20:25,500
<i>So if she has any problems, she won't say anything to me.</i>

299
00:20:27,099 --> 00:20:29,819
What about sending our photo to your mom?

300
00:20:29,819 --> 00:20:30,899
Why?

301
00:20:30,899 --> 00:20:35,019
She said to me in the car that she worried you would meet bad guys.

302
00:20:35,019 --> 00:20:40,040
Luckily, I didn't accept your strategy; otherwise, she wouldn't be able to sleep at night after getting home.

303
00:20:40,900 --> 00:20:45,140
But we still have to patch up the lie.

304
00:20:45,140 --> 00:20:47,320
Do you need a boyfriend right now?

305
00:20:47,320 --> 00:20:48,740
No.

306
00:20:48,740 --> 00:20:50,760
I'm not in a hurry, either.

307
00:20:50,760 --> 00:20:53,420
If you want to tell her we broke up,

308
00:20:53,420 --> 00:20:56,520
we should do it gradually, and take our time.

309
00:20:56,520 --> 00:20:58,780
Anyway, you've deceived her for a long time.

310
00:20:58,780 --> 00:21:01,900
At this stage, it's more important to make her feel at ease.

311
00:21:03,820 --> 00:21:05,840
You're right.

312
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:08,880
But then I have to trouble you a lot.

313
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:11,879
Never mind. Remember to treat me to meals.

314
00:21:11,879 --> 00:21:13,700
Come on.

00:22:15,379 --> 00:22:17,780
I want to withdraw my former words.

326
00:22:17,780 --> 00:22:20,800
You will find a perfect girlfriend.

327

Thanks for your blessing.

I've told you in the office. Why mention him again?

332
00:22:46,060 --> 00:22:48,720
You only followed my words.

333
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:50,338
I have to know his shortcomings, too.

334
00:22:50,338 --> 00:22:52,780
Get a comprehensive understanding.

335
00:22:52,780 --> 00:22:59,080
As far as I know, he really doesn't have any major shortcomings as the main doctor.

336
00:23:00,060 --> 00:23:01,840
He speaks well?

337
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:04,580
Certainly, not as good as you.

338
00:23:08,840 --> 00:23:13,540
Is being eloquent a disadvantage or an advantage?

339
00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:18,278
Forget it. I'll learn it myself.

340
00:23:29,540 --> 00:23:33,618
By the way, have you decided how to break up?

341
00:23:33,618 --> 00:23:35,400
Not yet.

342
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:36,979
It's a bit tricky.

343
00:23:36,979 --> 00:23:39,560
Will you help me think of one?

344
00:23:39,560 --> 00:23:42,360
I just thought of the ultimate excuse.

345
00:23:42,360 --> 00:23:46,180
Just tell her I died from a serious illness.

346
00:23:46,180 --> 00:23:48,260
Touch wood!

347
00:23:49,139 --> 00:23:51,000
Touch wood.

348
00:23:51,979 --> 00:23:55,200
It's better to say you cheated on me.

349
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:56,998
Then why don't you say you cheated?

350
00:23:56,998 --> 00:23:58,620
She won't believe it.

351
00:23:58,620 --> 00:24:01,040
So will she believe "I cheat"?

352
00:24:01,040 --> 00:24:03,080
You.

353
00:24:07,130 --> 00:24:10,578
Dad? Why are you here?

354
00:24:10,578 --> 00:24:13,840
I passed by and wanted to tell you something.

355
00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:17,340
I met Assistant Lin downstairs so I came to wait for you here.

356
00:24:18,940 --> 00:24:20,300
Go to work.

357
00:24:20,300 --> 00:24:22,340
President, should I make some tea?

358
00:24:22,340 --> 00:24:23,499
Dad, do you want some tea?

359
00:24:23,499 --> 00:24:25,819
No. I'll leave here soon.

360
00:24:25,819 --> 00:24:28,599
Okay. Get to work then.

361
00:24:29,180 --> 00:24:31,140
Dad, let's talk inside.

362
00:24:55,239 --> 00:24:57,960
We were joking just now.

363
00:24:57,960 --> 00:25:00,240
Is she the doctor that your mom told me about?

364
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:01,629
Your present assistant?

365
00:25:01,629 --> 00:25:06,079
Yes. Just temporary. She'll go back to Pediatrics soon.

366
00:25:07,180 --> 00:25:11,040
You must pay attention to proportion in the relationship between men and women.

367
00:25:11,040 --> 00:25:14,560
Don't do anything reckless.

368
00:25:14,560 --> 00:25:17,060
Is she flattering,

369
00:25:17,060 --> 00:25:21,160
fearing or liking you?

370
00:25:21,160 --> 00:25:23,319
You need to know it yourself.

371
00:25:23,319 --> 00:25:25,878
Dad, Mom was talking nonsense.

372
00:25:25,878 --> 00:25:27,540
I've done nothing.

373
00:25:27,540 --> 00:25:29,500
I just want to warn you.

374
00:25:29,500 --> 00:25:31,280
I understand.

375
00:25:31,280 --> 00:25:35,020
Dad, why do you come here today?

376
00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:38,700
President Zhang invited me to have some tea yesterday.

377
00:25:38,700 --> 00:25:41,420
We talked about Miss Ji.

378
00:25:43,339 --> 00:25:46,299
Come on. She doesn't agree with my plan.

379
00:25:46,299 --> 00:25:48,380
Did she really tell on me?

380
00:25:49,160 --> 00:25:52,220
Must you complete the documentary?

381
00:25:52,220 --> 00:25:54,380
Actually, we're preparing for it now.

382
00:25:54,380 --> 00:25:57,429
But I don't want the hospital operations to be

383
00:25:57,430 --> 00:25:59,090
influenced by Miss Ji's undue demands.

384
00:25:59,090 --> 00:26:01,459
That's too much of a joke.

385
00:26:01,459 --> 00:26:06,920
I heard that when you decided to make this documentary, you made it alone. Right?

386
00:26:06,920 --> 00:26:11,258
Yes. Because I think it's conducive to our development.

387
00:26:13,219 --> 00:26:16,379
A leader should be vigorous in action

388
00:26:16,379 --> 00:26:20,500
but it may also become a dictatorship in the mouth of others.

389
00:26:20,500 --> 00:26:25,320
President Zhang could unite with other senior executives to protest your plan.

390
00:26:25,320 --> 00:26:29,600
They can protest your decision and propose a new vote to decide this matter.

391
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:33,940
I have no reason and no opinion to stop them.

392
00:26:36,940 --> 00:26:41,200
If he really decides to do so, I can win.

393
00:26:42,859 --> 00:26:48,120
Being able to win and whether it's worth wasting time are two different things.

394
00:26:49,900 --> 00:26:55,459
Why don't you just find a way to deal with Miss Ji's affairs if you have the time?

395
00:26:58,580 --> 00:27:02,560
I believe you can complete it.

396
00:27:02,560 --> 00:27:06,760
But I wish you could complete it perfectly.

397
00:27:11,780 --> 00:27:13,580
I understand.

398
00:27:17,900 --> 00:27:20,558
Okay. Back to work. Don't see me off.

399
00:27:20,558 --> 00:27:24,360
Remember why I arranged for you to work here.

400
00:27:24,360 --> 00:27:26,899
You have to do your job well first.

401
00:27:26,899 --> 00:27:28,320
I know.

402
00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:32,380
By the way, Mom's birthday is coming.

403
00:27:32,380 --> 00:27:35,300
Don't forget to prepare a gift.

404
00:27:36,739 --> 00:27:38,700
Do I need your reminder?

405
00:27:38,700 --> 00:27:39,920
I got it.

406
00:27:39,920 --> 00:27:42,320
- Take care, Chairman.
- Take care.

407
00:28:03,130 --> 00:28:04,790
It's my first time coming here.

408
00:28:04,790 --> 00:28:06,970
The environment is good.

409
00:28:09,580 --> 00:28:12,800
I was a little embarrassed just now.

410
00:28:12,800 --> 00:28:15,599
Your dad isn't mad at you, is he?

411
00:28:15,599 --> 00:28:18,200
My dad doesn't get angry that easily.

412
00:28:19,199 --> 00:28:23,040
Your dad really doesn't look like the boss of a big group.

413
00:28:23,040 --> 00:28:25,900
Have you ever met the big boss of another company?

414
00:28:25,900 --> 00:28:28,340
Just in a TV series.

415
00:28:29,960 --> 00:28:33,659
The one who's overbearing, moody,

416
00:28:33,659 --> 00:28:36,900
using ways to force his children to have a commercial marriage,

417
00:28:36,900 --> 00:28:41,198
and do everything to make his firm to be the top one in the world?

418
00:28:41,198 --> 00:28:43,300
More or less.

419
00:28:43,300 --> 00:28:46,880
I feel that they only care about profit and have no family.

420
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:48,920
If they have a few children,

421
00:28:48,920 --> 00:28:52,679
they must be forced to inherit the family business

422
00:28:52,680 --> 00:28:54,700
and they are happy to watch them fight back and forth.

423
00:28:54,700 --> 00:28:59,420
It seems that only if the relatives do not recognize each other can the enterprise become bigger and stronger.

424
00:29:05,619 --> 00:29:08,660
I actually wanted to join the group to help my dad.

425
00:29:08,660 --> 00:29:10,960
I wanted him to rest more.

426
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:14,080
But he thought I wasn't capable enough.

427
00:29:14,080 --> 00:29:16,447
Not capable enough?

428
00:29:17,730 --> 00:29:19,820
I understand why he worries about me.

429
00:29:19,820 --> 00:29:25,320
The bigger the business, the greater the responsibility on the entrepreneur.

430
00:29:25,320 --> 00:29:28,560
Many people want to live a good life through their jobs

431
00:29:28,560 --> 00:29:30,680
so we can't let them down.

432
00:29:31,700 --> 00:29:39,400
My dad often said that he was able to make the company so big because society gave him good soil and he was lucky.

433
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:42,540
I don't think he's being modest.

434
00:29:42,540 --> 00:29:46,860
Actually, I'm so lucky to have been born into such a rich family.

435
00:29:46,860 --> 00:29:49,820
I don't want to cut off my background

436
00:29:49,820 --> 00:29:51,539
for I've gained much help from it.

437
00:29:51,539 --> 00:29:54,700
I won't pretend I started a business on my own.

438
00:29:54,700 --> 00:30:00,660
What I should do is to fully use all that I have and operate the enterprise well

439
00:30:00,660 --> 00:30:03,140
to repay society.

440
00:30:06,600 --> 00:30:07,738
Okay, enough.

441
00:30:07,738 --> 00:30:10,300
If I say too much, you'll think I'm brainwashing you.

442
00:30:10,300 --> 00:30:13,060
No. I think you're right.

443
00:30:13,060 --> 00:30:15,020
It's what you should do.

444
00:30:16,139 --> 00:30:20,800
It makes me... think of my dad.

445
00:30:21,780 --> 00:30:23,420
Your dad?

446
00:30:27,499 --> 00:30:30,260
<i>I can't believe it, not to mention her.</i>

447
00:30:30,840 --> 00:30:34,960
<i>She couldn't accept the fact that her father committed suicide.</i>

448
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:38,040
<i>Uncle committed suicide?</i>

449
00:30:38,040 --> 00:30:40,540
<i>Lanlan did not tell you?</i>

450
00:30:41,800 --> 00:30:43,660
<i>She never said this.</i>

451
00:30:43,660 --> 00:30:48,490
<i>I can see that she is still very angry with her father.</i>

452
00:30:48,490 --> 00:30:50,640
<i>If she didn't tell you this,</i>

453
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:53,520
<i>please pretend that I didn't tell you. Okay?</i>

454
00:30:57,270 --> 00:31:02,578
By the way, do you have the WeChat of Miss Ji's assistant?

455
00:31:02,578 --> 00:31:05,579
Tell her that I want to talk to Miss Ji.

456
00:31:05,579 --> 00:31:07,770
Tell them I've made a plan.

457
00:31:08,320 --> 00:31:11,180
You finally want to solve it?

458
00:31:11,700 --> 00:31:13,250
You've also been thinking about it?

459
00:31:13,250 --> 00:31:14,940
Of course.

460
00:31:14,940 --> 00:31:20,478
I saw you're indifferent attitude and worried you would leave here at any time.

461
00:31:21,739 --> 00:31:24,640
That's why you joined the dinner party?

462
00:31:27,730 --> 00:31:29,540
Even if you don't leave,

463
00:31:29,540 --> 00:31:34,939
I'd be worried that I will be treated differently by Chief Huang when I returned to the Pediatrics.

464
00:31:34,939 --> 00:31:37,439
I can't go to ask for your help if there is a problem.

465
00:31:37,439 --> 00:31:41,100
Then why didn't you tell me directly?

466
00:31:41,100 --> 00:31:46,280
I thought to tackle what I could handle by myself.

467
00:31:46,280 --> 00:31:48,580
Aren't we friends?

468
00:31:48,580 --> 00:31:51,799
I didn't believe you at that time.

469
00:31:51,799 --> 00:31:53,340
What about now?

470
00:31:53,340 --> 00:31:55,540
Now we're real friends.

471
00:31:55,540 --> 00:31:58,630
Otherwise, I wouldn't ask you to pretend to be my boyfriend.

472
00:31:59,620 --> 00:32:02,520
Wasn't it because you couldn't do it yourself?

473
00:32:03,060 --> 00:32:05,440
That's it. If I could do it myself,

474
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:08,690
I wouldn't even trouble my friends.

475
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:16,580
Opening your heart to your friends and asking for their help

476
00:32:16,580 --> 00:32:18,800
doesn't mean you are troubling them.

477
00:32:18,800 --> 00:32:21,030
Even if they aren't friends, only co-workers or even strangers,

478
00:32:21,030 --> 00:32:23,370
you can still ask for their help.

479
00:32:23,370 --> 00:32:26,380
Seeking help doesn't mean you're weak.

480
00:32:26,380 --> 00:32:30,738
If you are willing to help others, you must also get used to being helped by others.

481
00:32:30,738 --> 00:32:33,900
Then in your heart, you can be more courageous

482
00:32:33,900 --> 00:32:36,180
and always believe

483
00:32:36,180 --> 00:32:38,800
you're not alone.

484
00:32:41,099 --> 00:32:43,700
I'm not alone.

485
00:32:49,820 --> 00:32:52,040
I will remember this sentence.

486
00:32:54,800 --> 00:32:59,680
♫ <i>You are a part of my life</i> ♫

487
00:32:59,680 --> 00:33:02,560
♫ <i>You're my shining armor</i> ♫

488
00:33:02,560 --> 00:33:05,700
♫ <i>Now I'm pretty sure</i> ♫

489
00:33:05,700 --> 00:33:10,980
♫ <i>We will come to the end. Trust me</i> ♫

490
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:18,040
♫ <i>The dream makes it come true</i> ♫

491
00:33:21,920 --> 00:33:24,060
I ordered a cake. You want a piece?

492
00:33:24,060 --> 00:33:25,469
Cake so late?

493
00:33:25,470 --> 00:33:27,260
Don't you fear gaining weight?

494
00:33:27,260 --> 00:33:30,760
I'd rather die being fat than suffer.

495
00:33:31,760 --> 00:33:33,019
I can't afford it.

496
00:33:33,019 --> 00:33:35,040
The price is too high.

497
00:33:37,460 --> 00:33:40,860
And instant noodles. Want some?

498
00:33:40,860 --> 00:33:44,360
Instant noodles... with a piece of cake?

499
00:33:52,870 --> 00:33:54,820
Is your revision going well?

500
00:33:55,739 --> 00:33:58,979
Just so-so. I feel annoyed so I want something sweet.

501
00:33:58,980 --> 00:34:01,660
When I have something sweet, I also want some salty foods.

502
00:34:01,660 --> 00:34:04,920
That's why I cooked some noodles. To indulge myself.

503
00:34:04,920 --> 00:34:08,880
Occasional indulgence does help relieve stress.

504
00:34:09,619 --> 00:34:13,340
After the doctor has spoken, I feel more at ease.

505
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:18,320
So great.

506
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:21,280
When did you indulge yourself last time?

507
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:23,080
I don't remember.

508
00:34:23,080 --> 00:34:27,040
Could it be the time we got drunk a few years ago?

509
00:34:27,040 --> 00:34:29,660
That seems to be the case.

510
00:34:29,660 --> 00:34:33,220
We just lived together and didn't know each other.

511
00:34:33,220 --> 00:34:35,519
One day, you drank too much

512
00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:37,198
and hugged me crying sadly when you got back,

513
00:34:37,199 --> 00:34:42,120
telling me about your childhood and your parents divorce.

514
00:34:42,120 --> 00:34:43,918
Bingo. Come on.

515
00:34:43,919 --> 00:34:46,918
You didn't know how to comfort others so you drank with me.

516
00:34:46,919 --> 00:34:49,578
Later on, when you were drunk, you told me about your dad.

517
00:34:49,578 --> 00:34:51,760
Then I cried more bitterly.

518
00:34:52,539 --> 00:34:55,158
Without the chance to exchange our secrets,

519
00:34:55,159 --> 00:34:58,400
I'm afraid it would have been hard for us to be besties.

520
00:34:58,400 --> 00:35:00,000
I agree.

521
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:04,119
I'm really a person who doesn't like to take the initiative to make friends.

522
00:35:04,120 --> 00:35:07,460
But you are actually a very suitable person to be a friend.

523
00:35:08,379 --> 00:35:10,840
My personality is awkward. Right?

524
00:35:10,840 --> 00:35:12,760
I'm not saying you're awkward.

525
00:35:12,760 --> 00:35:16,500
I'm just thinking if you can open your heart a little more,

526
00:35:16,500 --> 00:35:20,100
things might become totally different.

527
00:35:21,399 --> 00:35:22,920
In fact, I do not know.

528
00:35:22,920 --> 00:35:25,640
It's good if you can be at peace with yourself.

529
00:35:27,900 --> 00:35:30,960
Have you told Lu Zhaoxi about your dad?

530
00:35:31,670 --> 00:35:33,360
No.

531
00:35:33,360 --> 00:35:36,360
We haven't gotten that far yet.

532
00:35:36,360 --> 00:35:37,799
Not that far?

533
00:35:37,800 --> 00:35:41,000
Or are you afraid to go further?

534
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:43,840
I'm not kidding. Seriously.

535
00:35:45,810 --> 00:35:47,820
How should I say it?

536
00:35:49,180 --> 00:35:51,240
The longer time I spend with him

537
00:35:51,240 --> 00:35:54,700
and the more I know him, the more I appreciate him.

538
00:35:54,720 --> 00:35:58,880
Sometimes, he'll affect me unconsciously.

539
00:35:58,880 --> 00:36:02,460
That's why I didn't refuse your jokes sometimes.

540
00:36:02,460 --> 00:36:06,360
Because he's really a good person.

541
00:36:07,600 --> 00:36:10,240
Sometimes I can also feel that in some moments,

542
00:36:11,020 --> 00:36:15,140
I do feel differently about him.

543
00:36:16,040 --> 00:36:20,120
But when I come to my senses and try to catch that feeling,

544
00:36:20,120 --> 00:36:23,360
it then vanishes.

545
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:28,180
Is it a Schrodinger's Cat?

546
00:36:28,900 --> 00:36:31,800
Do you know where my awkward personality is?

547
00:36:31,800 --> 00:36:35,840
Besides, I think it's so nice to be his friend.

548
00:36:35,840 --> 00:36:38,000
There's no reason for him to like me.

549
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:39,780
That's wrong.

550
00:36:39,780 --> 00:36:43,000
Are you going to tell me love needs no reason?

551
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:44,320
It does.

552
00:36:44,320 --> 00:36:47,338
But the reason you think is not necessarily the reason he cares.

553
00:36:47,338 --> 00:36:50,240
Everyone focuses on various things.

554
00:36:50,240 --> 00:36:52,400
For example. You're a flower.

555
00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:55,299
Some think it's pretty while some think it's ugly.

556
00:36:55,299 --> 00:36:57,099
Maybe someone thinks it's ugly now

557
00:36:57,099 --> 00:36:58,940
but later they might think you are pretty in the future.

558
00:36:58,940 --> 00:37:02,380
But the flowers are always in a bouquet.

559
00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:06,240
Sounds reasonable.

560
00:37:07,126 --> 00:37:09,366
The flower is still the same in a bouquet

561
00:37:09,366 --> 00:37:12,700
but no one will think it's a leaf.

562
00:37:13,439 --> 00:37:16,300
We're different types of people,

563
00:37:16,300 --> 00:37:19,740
just like instant noodles and cake.

564
00:37:19,740 --> 00:37:23,000
The noodles are the staple food while the cake is a dessert.

565
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:25,840
You can insist on eating them together

566
00:37:25,840 --> 00:37:29,720
but they still have their own positions and attributes.

567
00:37:31,120 --> 00:37:34,240
That is also right.

568
00:37:34,240 --> 00:37:36,679
Fine! I've written down your symptoms.

569
00:37:36,679 --> 00:37:39,280
I'll give you a prescription when I figure it out.

570
00:37:40,560 --> 00:37:43,099
Are you going to see a doctor?

571
00:37:43,099 --> 00:37:45,279
Doctors don't need to see a doctor.

572
00:37:45,280 --> 00:37:46,460
They do.

573
00:37:46,460 --> 00:37:48,759
But you are practicing medicine without a license

574
00:37:48,760 --> 00:37:50,579
I have been writing for a long time.

575
00:37:50,579 --> 00:37:53,739
Specializing in emotional problems is for internal reference only.

576
00:37:53,739 --> 00:37:56,020
Then am I your guinea pig?

577
00:37:57,280 --> 00:37:58,720
That's it.

578
00:39:03,800 --> 00:39:08,158
<i>Mr. Ye, my friend recommended that you work carefully,</i>

579
00:39:08,159 --> 00:39:09,820
<i>so I hired your team.</i>

580
00:39:09,820 --> 00:39:12,318
<i>Thank you. We'll work hard.</i>

581
00:39:12,318 --> 00:39:14,760
<i>What's wrong with that man?</i>

582
00:39:15,399 --> 00:39:17,198
<i>He was born with some intellectual problems.</i>

583
00:39:17,199 --> 00:39:18,820
<i>He follows along to do small work.</i>

584
00:39:18,820 --> 00:39:20,180
<i>He's very earnest.</i>

585
00:39:20,180 --> 00:39:22,280
<i>Don't ask him to come tomorrow.</i>

586
00:39:22,280 --> 00:39:25,500
<i>I promise he won't do anything wrong.</i>

587
00:39:25,500 --> 00:39:26,939
<i>Promise with what?</i>

588
00:39:26,939 --> 00:39:30,700
<i>I'm running my business and you asked an idiot to work here.</i>

589
00:39:30,700 --> 00:39:32,420
<i>Do you think it's auspicious?</i>

590
00:39:32,420 --> 00:39:35,159
<i>Mr. Ye, you should be fastidious.</i>

591
00:39:35,160 --> 00:39:38,840
<i>If you don't want to work, I'll ask another team to come.</i>

592
00:39:38,840 --> 00:39:40,840
<i>I see, Manager Zhang.</i>

593
00:39:51,939 --> 00:39:56,140
<i>He can work but the business owner minds him.</i>

594
00:39:57,420 --> 00:40:00,240
<i>It's great if you can hire him.</i>

595
00:40:00,240 --> 00:40:02,440
<i>Thank you so much!</i>

596
00:40:03,700 --> 00:40:05,280
<i>Dad,</i>

597
00:40:05,280 --> 00:40:09,260
<i>shall we not go to buy a cake?</i>

598
00:40:10,220 --> 00:40:13,700
<i>Lanlan, Dad is fine.</i>

599
00:40:13,700 --> 00:40:16,378
<i>When you grow up, you'll know that</i>

600
00:40:16,378 --> 00:40:19,298
<i>you'll face some difficulties at work.</i>

601
00:40:19,298 --> 00:40:21,160
<i>It's best to solve them.</i>

602
00:40:21,850 --> 00:40:25,460
<i>My birthday star, let's go to buy a cake.</i>

603
00:40:28,460 --> 00:40:31,259
<i>Lanlan, have you had its cake before?</i>

604
00:40:31,259 --> 00:40:33,079
<i>Why do you choose that shop?</i>

605
00:40:33,080 --> 00:40:34,359
<i>I have.</i>

606
00:40:34,360 --> 00:40:37,880
<i>Last time when Xiaomei invited us to celebrate in her new house.</i>

607
00:40:37,880 --> 00:40:39,900
<i>Her birthday cake was bought from there.</i>

608
00:40:39,900 --> 00:40:41,359
<i>Double-layer.</i>

609
00:40:41,360 --> 00:40:43,520
<i>Quite yummy!</i>

610
00:40:44,900 --> 00:40:49,000
<i>Dad, we can just buy the smallest one.</i>

611
00:40:53,770 --> 00:40:55,360
<i>Okay.</i>

612
00:40:55,360 --> 00:40:57,519
<i>When we move to a new house,</i>

613
00:40:57,520 --> 00:41:01,360
<i>you can also call your best friends to celebrate your birthday at home.</i>

614
00:41:02,040 --> 00:41:04,279
<i>Xiaomei's new house is so big!</i>

615
00:41:04,280 --> 00:41:05,800
<i>So beautiful!</i>

616
00:41:05,800 --> 00:41:09,720
<i>They say Xiaomei's parents are successful people.</i>

617
00:41:11,120 --> 00:41:14,760
<i>I want to be successful in the future, too.</i>

618
00:41:15,500 --> 00:41:19,680
<i>Lanlan, many people have a better life than Xiaomei</i>

619
00:41:19,680 --> 00:41:23,020
<i>while many people have a worse life than us.</i>

620
00:41:23,020 --> 00:41:25,519
<i>Different people have different origins</i>

621
00:41:25,520 --> 00:41:30,600
<i>so we can't use it to judge our life value.</i>

622
00:41:31,550 --> 00:41:34,020
<i>Then, what should we use?</i>

623
00:41:34,020 --> 00:41:37,020
<i>We can use kindness,</i>

624
00:41:37,020 --> 00:41:40,760
<i>efforts, and your dream.</i>

625
00:41:40,760 --> 00:41:44,338
<i>So we don't need to pursue success by comparing ourselves with others.</i>

626
00:41:44,338 --> 00:41:46,120
<i>Compare with ourselves.</i>

627
00:41:46,120 --> 00:41:50,460
<i>To pursue a better life than now.</i>

628
00:41:50,460 --> 00:41:51,740
<i>I'll keep it in my heart.</i>

629
00:41:51,740 --> 00:41:53,540
<i>Let's go.</i>
