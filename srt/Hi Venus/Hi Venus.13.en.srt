What do we have for dinner?

71
00:05:01,279 --> 00:05:04,219
He's in the car, waiting for me. I'm going out with him.

72
00:05:04,219 --> 00:05:07,579
He's here! He could wait here.

73
00:05:07,579 --> 00:05:10,419
It's awkward with you walking around.

74
00:05:10,419 --> 00:05:13,878
How could that be? What were you planning to do?

75
00:05:13,878 --> 00:05:16,880
Cut it off. You know what I mean.

76
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:20,019
You could bring him here next time. I don't mind it.

77
00:05:20,019 --> 00:05:22,579
I'm afraid you'd talk nonsense.

78

Yeah, I'm a drag.

As for the rest of the story, I'll see what I can do as I move on.

82
00:05:32,739 --> 00:05:35,900
You should treat yourself to dinner!

83
00:05:35,900 --> 00:05:38,079
Of course!

84
00:05:38,079 --> 00:05:42,159
To be honest, I'm learning things as I rewrite it.

85
00:05:42,159 --> 00:05:43,879
What do you mean?

86
00:05:43,879 --> 00:05:47,919
Do you remember when I used to say I'd like to jump out of my writing routine?

87
00:05:47,919 --> 00:05:49,978
I never made up my mind to challenge myself.

88
00:05:49,978 --> 00:05:52,339
I've always been following my routine.

89
00:05:52,339 --> 00:05:58,540
This time, I took this opportunity and forced myself out to make a breakthrough.

90
00:05:58,540 --> 00:06:02,499
You finally got out of your comfort zone.

91
00:06:02,499 --> 00:06:06,058
Stepping out of a comfort zone. That's a false proposition.

92
00:06:06,058 --> 00:06:08,659
It means that within your zone, it's not really comfortable.

93
00:06:08,659 --> 00:06:10,418
It's only a comfort zone in others' eyes.

94
00:06:10,418 --> 00:06:12,699
Or you're lying to yourself.

95
00:06:12,699 --> 00:06:17,339
In the still of the night, when searching your heart,

96
00:06:17,339 --> 00:06:21,138
you'll see that you'd never be satisfied with physical possessions alone.

97
00:06:21,138 --> 00:06:25,339
Other projects, like your dreams, personal fulfillment,

98
00:06:25,339 --> 00:06:29,320
sense of achievement and identity, and others matter too!

99
00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:31,159
- That's why I...
- Jiajia,

100
00:06:31,159 --> 00:06:33,559
you're my life coach!

101
00:06:33,559 --> 00:06:36,458
I'd never realized that!

102
00:06:36,458 --> 00:06:37,859
Realized what?

103
00:06:37,859 --> 00:06:40,879
How to solve a difficulty at work.

104
00:06:42,100 --> 00:06:46,799
Now that I've enlightened you, bring me to dinner with you.

105
00:06:50,139 --> 00:06:54,559
I'm just kidding, but don't forget to buy me some candies.

106
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:56,940
All right. I see what you mean.

107
00:06:59,540 --> 00:07:02,659
If that is so, there's no need to set up a meeting.

108
00:07:03,820 --> 00:07:06,240
Thank you. You've helped me a lot.

109
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:08,640
I should treat you to dinner.

110
00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:10,279
Bye.

111
00:07:11,820 --> 00:07:14,980
President, sorry for holding you up.

112
00:07:16,879 --> 00:07:20,998
Waiting for my girlfriend to finish her makeup. That's the basics.

113
00:07:20,998 --> 00:07:23,960
Someone is really in character.

114
00:07:27,220 --> 00:07:30,799
By the way, I just realized what Mrs. Ji might want.

115
00:07:30,799 --> 00:07:32,699
It could be wrong.

116
00:07:33,540 --> 00:07:34,979
I have an idea.

117
00:07:34,979 --> 00:07:37,899
The restaurant is nearby. Let's talk as we walk.

118
00:07:40,859 --> 00:07:42,780
What were you thinking?

119
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:50,040
For average people from ordinary families like me,

120
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:52,830
money solves most of the problems.

121
00:07:53,439 --> 00:07:56,070
That's true, indeed.

122
00:07:56,519 --> 00:07:59,639
But there are other circumstances in our life.

123
00:07:59,639 --> 00:08:02,600
There are expectations.

124
00:08:03,159 --> 00:08:05,859
Spiritual needs of a higher level.

125
00:08:05,859 --> 00:08:08,019
So even if you don't need money,

126
00:08:08,019 --> 00:08:11,938
you still work hard for the company and give back to society.

127
00:08:12,540 --> 00:08:16,480
That's why you volunteered to work in Taoyuan Village

128
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:19,540
even though it was shabby with lower wages.

129
00:08:20,699 --> 00:08:24,019
That's to say, as noble as Mrs. Ji is,

130
00:08:24,019 --> 00:08:27,840
she must be seeking something.

131
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:29,759
I've read interviews with her.

132
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:33,640
She often speaks of breakthroughs and transformations.

133
00:08:33,640 --> 00:08:36,080
That's a common way of speaking.

134
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:38,498
Let's assume she means what she says.

135
00:08:38,498 --> 00:08:41,959
What is it that holds her back from doing so?

136
00:08:41,959 --> 00:08:43,618
I did some rough research.

137
00:08:43,618 --> 00:08:46,319
If you're good at a certain type of character and the audience appreciates it,

138
00:08:46,319 --> 00:08:48,659
you'd get more similar scripts.

139
00:08:48,659 --> 00:08:49,859
It's a safe bet.

140
00:08:49,859 --> 00:08:52,579
Exactly. A safe bet.

141
00:08:52,579 --> 00:08:56,038
Her agency asks her to stick to that old style.

142
00:08:56,038 --> 00:08:59,058
As for her, maybe because of hesitation,

143
00:08:59,058 --> 00:09:02,100
she continues on out of habit.

144
00:09:02,780 --> 00:09:04,759
There's something you should know.

145
00:09:04,759 --> 00:09:09,780
Qiao Yu asked around and found out that Mrs. Ji is on the outs with her agency.

146
00:09:09,780 --> 00:09:12,259
Is it about the refutation statement of the rumors?

147
00:09:12,259 --> 00:09:15,119
It seems that Miss Ji doesn't really want to refute the rumors.

148
00:09:15,119 --> 00:09:16,740
Right!

149
00:09:16,740 --> 00:09:19,879
That's why I deduce she really wants a change.

150
00:09:19,879 --> 00:09:21,439
But she can't start it.

151
00:09:21,439 --> 00:09:23,819
Pregnancy stimulates her to do it.

152
00:09:23,819 --> 00:09:27,000
She wants to start by changing her appearance.

153
00:09:28,420 --> 00:09:32,858
But her agency disagrees. The statement makes it hard for her.

154
00:09:32,858 --> 00:09:35,220
That's why she came to my office by herself

155
00:09:35,220 --> 00:09:37,899
without communicating with her agent.

156
00:09:38,839 --> 00:09:43,319
You said to me that Mrs. Ji has a disclosure plan.

157
00:09:43,319 --> 00:09:44,880
Right.

158
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:48,478
Celebrities often find a good reason to go public.

159
00:09:48,478 --> 00:09:52,458
There have been a lot of cases where love affairs have been exposed before.

160
00:09:52,458 --> 00:09:54,980
Later, turned out it was the couple who sent out the message

161
00:09:54,980 --> 00:09:58,620
because they were to attend a love variety show.

162
00:09:58,620 --> 00:10:04,220
Do you think it's possible that Mrs. Ji's opposition to the documentary is a sham?

163
00:10:04,220 --> 00:10:07,878
What she really wants is for us to cooperate with her disclosure plan.

164
00:10:09,020 --> 00:10:13,600
Are you saying that she's sending out a direct message?

165
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:16,480
Exactly. She's sensitive about her reputation.

166
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:20,098
So she couldn't say it out. She wants us to bring it up.

167
00:10:20,098 --> 00:10:22,460
What she really wants is...

168
00:10:22,460 --> 00:10:24,380
- appearance!
- Appearance!

169
00:10:25,039 --> 00:10:26,840
It came to me as you were speaking.

170
00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:29,019
She asked to look at the script.

171
00:10:29,019 --> 00:10:31,258
I assumed she had already heard about the documentary.

172
00:10:31,258 --> 00:10:34,800
Then she made up her mind to come to us.

173
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:38,200
To her surprise, the documentary isn't all about pregnant women.

174
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:39,760
She was a little upset.

175
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:42,839
That was why she created a distraction.

176
00:10:42,839 --> 00:10:47,499
President, if she shows up in the documentary, would it be beneficial?

177
00:10:47,499 --> 00:10:50,439
It could bring her fame and fortune.

178
00:10:50,439 --> 00:10:53,439
As for us, it could be a selling point for advertising.

179
00:10:53,439 --> 00:10:57,979
But I'm concerned that her appearance in the documentary would steal the show.

180
00:10:57,979 --> 00:11:00,920
Let me see. I'll talk to the producer first.

181
00:11:00,920 --> 00:11:03,040
See if he can adjust the script.

182
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:07,099
Sure. I'll tell her when you come up with a new plan.

183
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,220
Finally, we're getting somewhere.

184
00:11:11,220 --> 00:11:13,018
Come on. Time for lunch.

185
00:11:13,018 --> 00:11:14,079
Let's celebrate.

186
00:11:14,079 --> 00:11:15,699
Sure.

187
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:19,460
It looks appetizing!

188
00:11:19,460 --> 00:11:21,960
Let me take a photo.

189
00:11:24,340 --> 00:11:25,960
Thanks.

190
00:11:34,259 --> 00:11:37,739
Qiao Yu is busy now. I'll ask her to treat you when she's back.

191
00:11:37,739 --> 00:11:41,840
I'm having crayfish with Ye Shilan right now.

192
00:11:43,540 --> 00:11:45,320
Your mom?

193
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:53,760
You get along well with your ex-girlfriend.

194
00:11:55,860 --> 00:11:58,599
How do you know she's my ex-girlfriend?

195
00:11:58,599 --> 00:12:00,599
She told me herself.

196
00:12:01,939 --> 00:12:05,179
Your mom wants you to get back with her.

197
00:12:09,300 --> 00:12:10,980
What do you think?

198
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:14,139
Good for you.

199
00:12:14,860 --> 00:12:17,320
You get on well with her.

200
00:12:18,019 --> 00:12:22,259
I trust in you. I'll go after her for real.

201
00:12:23,540 --> 00:12:27,339
Don't stress me out by saying that.

202
00:12:27,339 --> 00:12:29,120
I don't know her very well.

203
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:32,299
It's okay. She'll be in the hospital anyway.

204
00:12:32,299 --> 00:12:34,659
You can learn more about her.

205
00:12:34,659 --> 00:12:36,719
Is she ill?

206
00:12:37,540 --> 00:12:39,058
She works in the documentary industry.

207
00:12:39,058 --> 00:12:41,559
She just got acquainted with the producer.

208
00:12:41,559 --> 00:12:44,779
She was hired to take part in this project. That's why she came back.

209
00:12:55,580 --> 00:12:57,690
You should meet her.

210
00:12:57,690 --> 00:13:01,280
Maybe, you'll find her to not be so bad.

211
00:13:03,379 --> 00:13:05,819
It's fine if you think she isn't so bad.

212
00:13:09,359 --> 00:13:14,300
But this kind of thing also depends on your feelings. Right?

213
00:13:14,300 --> 00:13:18,000
That's right. It takes time to find your feelings.

214
00:13:20,220 --> 00:13:22,540
Why did you break up?

215
00:13:22,540 --> 00:13:24,520
I didn't have any feelings.

216
00:13:26,340 --> 00:13:28,660
This is indeed a problem.

217
00:13:31,819 --> 00:13:36,299
If you ask me, feelings are really mysterious.

218
00:13:36,299 --> 00:13:38,119
What do you mean?

219
00:13:39,039 --> 00:13:43,099
The moment you meet someone,

220
00:13:43,099 --> 00:13:46,130
you'll know if she's your type.

221
00:13:46,130 --> 00:13:47,740
That's right.

222
00:13:47,740 --> 00:13:49,840
The beginnings of love at first sight.

223
00:13:49,840 --> 00:13:53,240
Essentially, it's the beginnings of sexual attraction.

224
00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:55,699
It's also the instinct of animals.

225
00:13:56,379 --> 00:13:57,760
That's right.

226
00:13:57,760 --> 00:14:00,940
The attraction will be aroused under certain circumstances,

227
00:14:00,940 --> 00:14:02,639
such as eye contact,

228
00:14:02,639 --> 00:14:05,380
physical contact, rumors,

229
00:14:05,380 --> 00:14:09,640
environment, even emotional clues.

230
00:14:10,719 --> 00:14:14,660
That's because hormones in the body are at work.

231
00:14:17,180 --> 00:14:20,420
But I think it's unreliable.

232
00:14:20,420 --> 00:14:23,340
What do you think is reliable?

233
00:14:23,939 --> 00:14:27,599
Why would I tell you? You'd steal my tricks!

234
00:14:28,730 --> 00:14:30,770
I don't want to see you hurt.

235
00:14:30,770 --> 00:14:34,340
I'm just trying to help you analyze and make an analysis.

236
00:14:34,340 --> 00:14:39,080
Who is hurt? I'm used to learning and analyzing.

237
00:14:39,080 --> 00:14:41,640
But you, once you fall in, you can't get out.

238
00:14:41,640 --> 00:14:43,650
You should learn from me.

239
00:14:43,659 --> 00:14:45,719
Who fell in and can't get out?

240
00:14:45,719 --> 00:14:49,559
Acting stubborn. You still have a crush on Jiang Huaiming.

241
00:14:54,900 --> 00:14:58,120
I'm so heartbroken after eating this meal.

242
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:02,920
Now it's clarified. That's good.

243
00:15:03,900 --> 00:15:08,270
How could there be such absurd rumors? And you believed them!

244
00:15:08,270 --> 00:15:10,290
I have proof!

245
00:15:10,290 --> 00:15:14,090
Back in Taoyuan Village, you carried his photo with you.

246
00:15:14,099 --> 00:15:17,580
I left it in my book and forgot about it.

247
00:15:17,580 --> 00:15:19,498
I tossed it away in your face!

248
00:15:19,498 --> 00:15:21,820
Exactly! He rejected your love confession.

249
00:15:21,820 --> 00:15:23,830
It's reasonable if you hate him.

250
00:15:23,839 --> 00:15:27,219
Not at all! That's your theory.

251
00:15:28,100 --> 00:15:33,440
I have a question. Why did you lie that your boyfriend was a doctor?

252
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:37,520
I never lied from the beginning. Okay?

253
00:15:37,520 --> 00:15:39,680
Didn't I tell you before?

254
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:43,679
There was a reason why I lied to my mom.

255
00:15:44,300 --> 00:15:46,450
I just started a secret relationship with Jiang Huaiming.

256
00:15:46,450 --> 00:15:48,599
Right after I told my mom,

257
00:15:48,599 --> 00:15:52,510
we often disagreed with each other. We were always quarreling.

258
00:15:52,510 --> 00:15:54,210
I had a bad feeling.

259
00:15:54,210 --> 00:15:56,610
That was why I didn't send his photo to my mom.

260
00:15:56,619 --> 00:15:59,639
After we broke up, I went to Taoyuan Village again.

261
00:15:59,639 --> 00:16:02,360
I was thinking about telling her after I returned.

262
00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:05,998
I kept putting it off. Then, it became like this.

263
00:16:10,399 --> 00:16:13,380
Why didn't you make that clear earlier?

264
00:16:13,380 --> 00:16:15,620
I didn't think it was necessary.

265
00:16:15,620 --> 00:16:17,358
He has a new girlfriend now.

266
00:16:17,358 --> 00:16:20,940
We just act as if nothing happened. It's less awkward that way.

267
00:16:20,940 --> 00:16:23,580
Besides, you didn't ask me about it.

268
00:16:23,580 --> 00:16:27,458
That's the subordinate's privacy. I dare not to ask.

269
00:16:27,458 --> 00:16:30,420
But you said you'd take me as a friend. Right?

270
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:34,740
It's even more embarrassing to pry into your sad story.

271
00:16:35,900 --> 00:16:38,180
Always have excuses.

272
00:16:39,660 --> 00:16:42,018
What about your relationship with your ex? It seems pretty good.

273
00:16:42,018 --> 00:16:44,240
Every time I ask about him, you're full of compliments.

274
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:48,619
That's different. I'm still annoyed when seeing him.

275
00:16:48,619 --> 00:16:51,979
But I must admit that he has his advantages.

276
00:16:51,979 --> 00:16:55,919
What's more, we are just colleagues right now.

277
00:16:59,220 --> 00:17:01,320
Now I can rest assured.

278
00:17:02,860 --> 00:17:05,218
You didn't have to worry about it at all. Right?

279
00:17:05,218 --> 00:17:08,138
I wanted to. So what?

280
00:17:08,138 --> 00:17:10,739
Why are you so childish today?

281
00:17:10,739 --> 00:17:14,100
Because... I saw a rainbow.

282
00:17:14,100 --> 00:17:16,019
Rainbow?

283
00:17:16,019 --> 00:17:17,478
I saw a rainbow in the afternoon.

284
00:17:17,479 --> 00:17:20,279
Something good happened. I'm just happy.

285
00:17:20,959 --> 00:17:23,240
Is it about Mrs. Ji?

286
00:17:23,240 --> 00:17:24,700
Of course not!

287
00:17:24,700 --> 00:17:26,239
What is it about then?

288
00:17:26,239 --> 00:17:28,199
I'll tell you later.

289
00:17:28,959 --> 00:17:32,399
So mysterious. I don't want to hear it.

290
00:17:32,399 --> 00:17:34,219
You have to!

291
00:17:34,219 --> 00:17:35,399
Bla-bla-bla.

292
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:38,358
Stop right there. I'll tell you now.

293

Qi!

309
00:19:12,999 --> 00:19:15,140
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

310
00:19:23,180 --> 00:19:25,280
Welcome!

311
00:19:30,499 --> 00:19:33,019
- What would you like to drink?
- The same as usual.

312
00:19:33,019 --> 00:19:36,199
What would you like to drink?

313
00:19:37,250 --> 00:19:39,090
Strawberry smoothie.

314
00:19:39,090 --> 00:19:41,930
In my cup, please. Thanks.

315
00:20:06,520 --> 00:20:09,619
I've seen your modification. It's great.

316
00:20:13,139 --> 00:20:16,380
Don't you think it's more surprising that way?

317
00:20:17,039 --> 00:20:19,279
Should I say thank you?

318
00:20:19,279 --> 00:20:21,319
That's not what I mean.

319
00:20:21,319 --> 00:20:24,099
I know you've spent a lot of time changing it.

320
00:20:24,099 --> 00:20:25,460
Thank you.

321
00:20:25,460 --> 00:20:27,660
Thank you?

322
00:20:27,660 --> 00:20:30,399
Do you mean sorry?

323
00:20:31,259 --> 00:20:33,020
Sorry.

324
00:20:35,580 --> 00:20:38,500
I know that was a lot to ask.

325
00:20:38,500 --> 00:20:40,520
Still, you brought it up.

326
00:20:41,300 --> 00:20:44,319
I've got many negative reviews. Are you happy now?

327
00:20:44,319 --> 00:20:46,400
I never read the reviews.

328
00:21:04,619 --> 00:21:09,279
Friendly reminder. Reading my novel won't defame you.

329
00:21:09,279 --> 00:21:12,860
It's just an excuse to turn you down.

330
00:21:26,460 --> 00:21:28,299
Be sure to come back after this course of treatment.

331
00:21:28,299 --> 00:21:30,718
Call me if you have any questions. Or just send a direct message.

332
00:21:30,718 --> 00:21:33,338
Thanks, Dr. Jiang. Time to say goodbye.

333
00:21:33,338 --> 00:21:34,738
Bye-bye, Dr. Jiang.

334
00:21:34,738 --> 00:21:36,940
- Bye, Xiaoye.
- Let's go.

335
00:21:38,160 --> 00:21:39,179
What would you like for dinner?

336
00:21:39,179 --> 00:21:42,100
Here you are. Let's talk inside.

337
00:21:42,700 --> 00:21:44,600
Any other appointments?

338
00:21:44,600 --> 00:21:48,518
Yeah. A patient just called me. There's a traffic jam.

339
00:21:49,180 --> 00:21:52,640
Uncle said he'd talk to the president today.

340
00:21:54,859 --> 00:21:56,660
I know you have faith in Dr. Ye.

341
00:21:56,660 --> 00:21:59,270
But people can't stay rational all the time.

342
00:21:59,279 --> 00:22:02,580
Besides, I want to fight for you too.

343
00:22:02,580 --> 00:22:05,679
I understand. It's just... I owe Dean Xu once.

344
00:22:05,679 --> 00:22:08,620
Just relax. He knows what to do.

345
00:22:17,460 --> 00:22:19,000
Come in.

346
00:22:20,619 --> 00:22:22,738
Dean Xu. Black coffee for you.

347
00:22:22,738 --> 00:22:26,359
Thanks. Dr. Ye, hold on.

348
00:22:26,359 --> 00:22:30,579
President, I want a word with Dr. Ye. May I?

349
00:22:30,579 --> 00:22:32,539
Sure.

350
00:22:32,539 --> 00:22:38,300
I didn't know that Chief Huang forbade you to come back.

351
00:22:38,300 --> 00:22:41,378
But I was part of the incident. I must apologize to you.

352
00:22:41,378 --> 00:22:43,959
Don't be sorry. No need to apologize.

353
00:22:43,959 --> 00:22:46,700
Still, I must make it clear to you.

354
00:22:46,700 --> 00:22:51,778
The Chief of Thoracic Surgery had briefed me before you took the patient in.

355
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:56,300
So... it was you who decided to reject the surgery.

356
00:22:56,300 --> 00:23:01,260
Yes. I was aware it was a surgery destined to fail.

357
00:23:01,260 --> 00:23:02,760
I saved a similar patient once.

358
00:23:02,760 --> 00:23:05,270
But their conditions were different.

359
00:23:06,019 --> 00:23:09,899
We're not gods. When a patient comes into the operating room,

360
00:23:09,899 --> 00:23:12,310
his relatives assume there will be hope.

361
00:23:12,310 --> 00:23:15,130
But in this situation, we're hurting them more.

362
00:23:15,130 --> 00:23:16,940
It's much more painful.

363
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:21,259
Dean Xu, I understand.

364
00:23:21,259 --> 00:23:24,699
That's all I have to say. You may leave.

365
00:23:36,900 --> 00:23:39,680
You said it at the meeting just now

366
00:23:39,680 --> 00:23:41,618
that we must not treat our subordinates unfairly

367
00:23:41,618 --> 00:23:44,119
due to our personal preferences.

368
00:23:44,119 --> 00:23:49,439
May I ask what your standard is on the candidate doctor for the film?

369
00:23:50,300 --> 00:23:55,740
Are you concerned that I'm leaving Dr. Jiang out because Dr. Ye said something?

370
00:23:55,740 --> 00:24:01,919
Right. However, what I just said to Dr. Ye has nothing to do with this.

371
00:24:01,919 --> 00:24:05,720
I understand. That's just a statement of fact.

372
00:24:05,720 --> 00:24:08,059
I'll be honest with you.

373
00:24:08,059 --> 00:24:11,020
It has nothing to do with Dr. Ye.

374
00:24:14,979 --> 00:24:19,619
If that is so, I won't bother to ask.

375
00:24:19,619 --> 00:24:21,959
That is all. Goodbye.

376
00:24:21,959 --> 00:24:27,060
Dean Xu, you hold a grudge against me, don't you?

377
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:33,560
Why would you say that?

378
00:24:34,619 --> 00:24:40,019
I'm a young and bold outsider who parachuted into the job because of my family's resources.

379
00:24:40,019 --> 00:24:43,439
I'd feel the same way if I were you.

380
00:24:43,439 --> 00:24:45,280
What's your point?

381
00:24:45,280 --> 00:24:49,000
I remember you disagreed on making the documentary.

382
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:50,939
Later, Mrs. Ji found out about the documentary.

383
00:24:50,939 --> 00:24:54,278
She tried to hold it back. The project nearly got canceled.

384
00:24:54,278 --> 00:24:58,879
With no documentary, there's no competition at all.

385
00:24:58,879 --> 00:25:02,339
So, it's more related to you than others.

386
00:25:03,339 --> 00:25:06,939
So, you are targeting me?

387
00:25:08,360 --> 00:25:13,340
No. I want to hear what you think.

388
00:25:18,859 --> 00:25:23,879
That's right. I must admit that I didn't like you at first.

389
00:25:23,879 --> 00:25:26,240
The reason is similar to what you said.

390
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:31,120
I didn't want to see you building your resume here.

391
00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:35,039
As you work, I witnessed the changes you've brought to the hospital.

392
00:25:35,039 --> 00:25:37,900
I've been reflecting on myself.

393
00:25:37,900 --> 00:25:40,670
The incident with Chief Huang alerted me.

394
00:25:40,670 --> 00:25:42,510
I didn't agree with what he did.

395
00:25:42,519 --> 00:25:47,120
But I didn't stop him from doing it. That is my fault.

396
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:52,959
As for now, I hold no grudges. I should work harder.

397
00:25:52,959 --> 00:25:55,160
That's what I'm thinking.

398
00:25:57,339 --> 00:26:03,170
Dean Xu, before coming here, I talked to some people about you.

399
00:26:03,170 --> 00:26:06,060
You're a skillful expert and an upright person.

400
00:26:06,060 --> 00:26:08,790
You are a senior that I respect.

401
00:26:09,820 --> 00:26:13,339
Sometimes it takes a certain amount of opportunity to eliminate misunderstandings.

402
00:26:13,339 --> 00:26:18,419
If I said this to you on my arrival, you probably wouldn't believe it.

403
00:26:18,419 --> 00:26:24,060
That's why I'm saying it now. That's the truth.

404
00:26:26,979 --> 00:26:32,360
As for the main doctor to be filmed, I did it for a reason.

405
00:26:38,940 --> 00:26:41,299
So, you fought for an extra spot.

406
00:26:41,299 --> 00:26:43,539
But deliberately did not disclose it to Jiang Huaiming.

407
00:26:43,539 --> 00:26:46,100
Because you wanted Dean Xu to come to you.

408
00:26:46,100 --> 00:26:49,078
Exactly. Is there a problem?

409
00:26:49,078 --> 00:26:51,260
Too insidious.

410
00:26:51,260 --> 00:26:53,619
Excuse me?

411
00:26:53,619 --> 00:26:58,359
Sorry. I overstepped my boundary.

412
00:26:58,359 --> 00:27:01,500
Are you thinking that I'm jealous of Jiang Huaiming?

413
00:27:01,500 --> 00:27:03,220
I didn't say so.

414
00:27:03,220 --> 00:27:05,879
Yeah. I am jealous of him.

415
00:27:05,879 --> 00:27:09,219
All in all, I'm your boyfriend.

416
00:27:09,219 --> 00:27:11,059
My fake one!

417
00:27:13,460 --> 00:27:19,079
It's about time to find a real girlfriend, or I'll be confused.

418
00:27:19,840 --> 00:27:22,899
It's not that easy.

419
00:27:24,139 --> 00:27:26,560
Didn't you say that I am charming?

420
00:27:27,739 --> 00:27:33,400
But you are demanding and you seek a sense of security.

421
00:27:36,219 --> 00:27:39,119
I have a good candidate now.

422
00:27:40,339 --> 00:27:44,060
Who is it? Do I know her?

423
00:27:47,960 --> 00:27:51,339
You do want to make up with Qiao Yu.

424
00:27:53,660 --> 00:27:57,439
Say it out if there's anything I can do.

425
00:28:00,219 --> 00:28:02,199
Do you mean it?

426
00:28:02,859 --> 00:28:07,459
As long as you like it, I am in favor.

427
00:28:08,900 --> 00:28:10,579
Okay.

428
00:28:28,700 --> 00:28:32,879
I was a little concerned at first. Turns out, they were very reasonable.

429
00:28:32,879 --> 00:28:36,899
You've done a lot of work. What you said reassures them.

430
00:28:37,539 --> 00:28:39,738
I thought you'd say I was eloquent.

431
00:28:39,738 --> 00:28:42,998
Four years on the debate team. I praised you many times.

432
00:28:42,998 --> 00:28:46,860
It makes sense. You picked me up in a debate contest.

433
00:28:47,660 --> 00:28:51,219
Ms. Qiao, would you like some coffee with oat milk?

434
00:28:51,219 --> 00:28:52,979
Why not? Thanks.

435
00:28:52,979 --> 00:28:54,699
No problem.

436
00:28:55,179 --> 00:28:59,238
By the way, Assistant Ye, I just ordered a coffee delivery for the medics,

437
00:28:59,238 --> 00:29:01,759
President Lu asked me to leave your number.

438
00:29:01,759 --> 00:29:04,339
Okay. I'll pick it up as it arrives.

439
00:29:04,339 --> 00:29:06,238
Thank you. No problem.

440
00:29:06,238 --> 00:29:08,239
I'll leave you guys here.

441
00:29:36,219 --> 00:29:37,359
Hello, Mom.

442
00:29:37,359 --> 00:29:40,359
<i>Lanlan, have you had dinner?</i>

443
00:29:40,359 --> 00:29:42,080
Yeah.

444
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:45,640
<i>I made some sausages. I'll send you some.</i>

445
00:29:45,640 --> 00:29:48,739
Don't make it a giant package. I couldn't take that much.

446
00:29:48,739 --> 00:29:53,039
<i>By the way, have you met Lu's parents?</i>

447
00:29:54,320 --> 00:29:55,700
Yeah.

448
00:29:55,700 --> 00:29:58,179
<i>What's their impression of you?</i>

449
00:29:58,979 --> 00:30:02,859
We just met twice. We didn't talk much.

450
00:30:02,859 --> 00:30:07,118
<i>That's not right. You have to be proactive with your elders.</i>

451
00:30:07,118 --> 00:30:10,299
<i>Once you receive the package, send some to Lu's parents.</i>

452
00:30:10,299 --> 00:30:12,038
<i>Tastier than the ones sold in the supermarket.</i>

453
00:30:12,038 --> 00:30:13,499
I get it.

454
00:30:13,499 --> 00:30:15,979
Mom, I need to take a shower.

455
00:30:15,979 --> 00:30:18,119
<i>Sure. Go ahead.</i>

456
00:30:18,119 --> 00:30:19,719
Bye.

457
00:30:21,180 --> 00:30:23,000
What's wrong?

458
00:30:26,259 --> 00:30:28,239
It's my mom.

459
00:30:28,239 --> 00:30:30,059
She's so concerned about my relationship.

460
00:30:30,059 --> 00:30:32,180
That's stressful.

461
00:30:32,180 --> 00:30:35,598
She must appreciate Lu Zhaoxi. She doesn't want you to lose him.

462
00:30:35,598 --> 00:30:36,859
To lose him?

463
00:30:36,859 --> 00:30:39,199
He was never mine!

464
00:30:39,859 --> 00:30:42,399
Now you're thinking about it.

465
00:30:42,399 --> 00:30:47,679
No. I want to bring this lie to an end.

466
00:30:47,679 --> 00:30:49,758
That way, he can get back with his ex.

467
00:30:49,758 --> 00:30:51,680
His ex?

468
00:30:52,300 --> 00:30:56,380
His ex is working on the documentary in our hospital.

469
00:30:56,380 --> 00:30:59,880
President Lu wants to get back with her.

470
00:30:59,880 --> 00:31:02,599
Why did they break up?

471
00:31:02,599 --> 00:31:05,839
It was because... he had no feelings.

472
00:31:05,839 --> 00:31:08,099
Why would he get back then?

473
00:31:08,099 --> 00:31:10,138
It's quite common.

474
00:31:10,138 --> 00:31:14,718
After breaking up for some time, they realize they are a match.

475
00:31:16,080 --> 00:31:19,618
What's more, his ex-girlfriend is very pretty.

476
00:31:19,618 --> 00:31:23,959
She seems nice. She's got resources. And she's capable.

477
00:31:23,959 --> 00:31:26,920
She could help President with his job.

478
00:31:26,920 --> 00:31:28,639
She was on the debate team.

479
00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:32,719
Eloquent as she is, she is President's ideal girlfriend.

480
00:31:32,719 --> 00:31:36,080
Sounds to me you're jealous of her.

481
00:31:36,080 --> 00:31:40,659
Don't talk nonsense. I'm stating the facts.

482
00:31:40,659 --> 00:31:44,980
- Did Lu Zhaoxi tell you himself that he wants to get back?
- Right!

483
00:31:44,980 --> 00:31:46,659
How could he do this?

484
00:31:46,659 --> 00:31:49,599
He's on a date with you! Now he's thinking about others.

485
00:31:49,599 --> 00:31:51,560
Are you serious?

486
00:31:51,560 --> 00:31:54,539
I asked him to pretend to be my boyfriend.

487
00:31:54,539 --> 00:31:56,439
Then who forced him to be ambiguous.

488
00:31:56,439 --> 00:32:00,120
Not ambiguous! We're just friends.

489
00:32:00,120 --> 00:32:02,659
We just hang out after work.

490
00:32:02,659 --> 00:32:05,039
It's not what you think.

491
00:32:05,039 --> 00:32:06,940
There was no disadvantage.

492
00:32:06,940 --> 00:32:10,060
What will you do now?

493
00:32:10,060 --> 00:32:11,790
I've thought about it.

494
00:32:11,790 --> 00:32:15,390
Recently, I've been too presumptuous in front of him.

495
00:32:15,399 --> 00:32:18,038
I must behave myself. Get my attitude right.

496
00:32:18,038 --> 00:32:19,398
He's my boss!

497
00:32:19,398 --> 00:32:21,839
What about your friendship?

498
00:32:22,519 --> 00:32:26,439
It's better to keep a distance from friends of the opposite sex.

499
00:32:26,439 --> 00:32:29,680
Otherwise, other girls might stay away.

500
00:32:29,680 --> 00:32:33,018
Are you immune to his proposition? Aren't you upset?

501
00:32:33,680 --> 00:32:40,159
To be honest, I have this weird feeling. Just a little bit.

502
00:32:40,159 --> 00:32:42,160
But now I've figured it out.

503
00:32:42,160 --> 00:32:46,219
We keep making fun of each other. It is misleading.

504
00:32:46,219 --> 00:32:48,819
I hope you're true to yourself.

505
00:32:48,819 --> 00:32:51,460
Be sure to tell me if you're unhappy.

506
00:32:51,460 --> 00:32:55,980
No worries. My psychologist. I am honest with you.

507
00:33:18,099 --> 00:33:19,780
<i>That's the way he is.</i>

508
00:33:19,780 --> 00:33:22,219
<i>When talking in private, he could be unreasonable.</i>

509
00:33:22,219 --> 00:33:24,040
<i>Unreasonable?</i>

510
00:33:25,159 --> 00:33:28,079
<i>For example, when he sees us hanging out together,</i>

511
00:33:28,079 --> 00:33:32,159
<i>he'd suspect there's a love story between us.</i>

512
00:33:32,159 --> 00:33:34,539
<i>Us? That's impossible!</i>

513
00:33:34,539 --> 00:33:38,619
<i>Exactly. We're more like buddies.</i>

514
00:33:38,619 --> 00:33:42,918
<i>Don't lead me into the men's camp! I want to find a boyfriend!</i>

515
00:33:47,619 --> 00:33:50,300
Is it impossible?

516
00:33:50,300 --> 00:33:53,719
<i>You do want to make it up with Qiao Yu.</i>

517
00:33:54,339 --> 00:33:57,338
<i>Say it out if there's anything I can do.</i>

518
00:33:57,338 --> 00:33:58,560
<i>Do you mean it?</i>

519
00:33:58,560 --> 00:34:03,379
<i>As long as you like it, I am in favor.</i>

520
00:34:13,880 --> 00:34:16,539
Only taking me as a friend?

521
00:34:19,059 --> 00:34:21,460
I'm not that bad!

522
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:32,340
♫ <i>You are a part of my life</i> ♫

523
00:34:32,340 --> 00:34:35,330
<i>- Surprise!
- Qiao Yu?</i>

524
00:34:36,039 --> 00:34:37,138
<i>When did you get back?</i>

525
00:34:37,138 --> 00:34:39,279
<i>A few days ago! I wanted to surprise you!</i>

526
00:34:39,279 --> 00:34:40,900
<i>- It was a surprise!
- Did you miss me?</i>

527
00:34:40,900 --> 00:34:42,760
<i>You tell me!</i>

528
00:34:43,360 --> 00:34:45,700
They are close.

529
00:34:46,299 --> 00:34:48,760
I see intimacy.

530
00:34:51,840 --> 00:34:54,419
<i>By the way, Ye Shilan, two cups of coffee, please.</i>

531
00:34:54,419 --> 00:34:58,740
<i>Make one of them with oak milk. She's lactose intolerant.</i>

532
00:34:58,740 --> 00:35:01,939
President hasn't forgotten her.

533
00:35:01,939 --> 00:35:04,040
And he's considerate.

534
00:35:07,320 --> 00:35:10,099
<i>My mom misses you, too! She wants you to come for dinner.</i>

535
00:35:10,099 --> 00:35:13,620
<i>Will she talk about getting back together again?</i>

536
00:35:15,180 --> 00:35:19,580
Mama Lu wants them to marry.

537
00:35:21,279 --> 00:35:24,399
President still has great hope.

538
00:35:27,660 --> 00:35:29,899
What am I worrying about?

539
00:35:29,899 --> 00:35:31,919
Time to sleep.

540
00:35:35,180 --> 00:35:43,020
♫ <i>Just with you </i> ♫

541
00:36:02,379 --> 00:36:04,139
Didn't sleep well?

542
00:36:06,500 --> 00:36:08,519
Didn't sleep well last night.

543
00:36:08,519 --> 00:36:10,859
Why? What's on your mind?

544
00:36:10,859 --> 00:36:12,560
Nothing.

545
00:36:13,660 --> 00:36:16,859
There's a new sweet shop near my house. It's good.

546
00:36:16,859 --> 00:36:18,300
Have a try.

547
00:36:18,900 --> 00:36:20,639
Thanks.

548
00:36:32,919 --> 00:36:36,439
Is he trying to keep me silent?

549
00:36:42,260 --> 00:36:43,139
Hello.

550
00:36:43,139 --> 00:36:45,340
<i>Hi, flower delivery.</i>

551
00:36:45,340 --> 00:36:47,200
Hold on. I'm on my way.

552
00:36:47,200 --> 00:36:48,739
<i>Sure.</i>

553
00:36:58,900 --> 00:37:00,660
Come in.

554
00:37:05,940 --> 00:37:10,161
Tulip. It stands for purity and is a sign of good luck.

555
00:37:10,619 --> 00:37:12,619
Quite active today.

556
00:37:12,619 --> 00:37:14,939
Now President wants to know, it's what I should do.

557
00:37:14,939 --> 00:37:17,900
I ought to be professional with my job.

558
00:37:17,900 --> 00:37:19,739
I never questioned your professionalism.

559
00:37:19,739 --> 00:37:21,279
No, you didn't.

560
00:37:21,279 --> 00:37:24,600
After reflecting on myself, I think I've gone too far.

561
00:37:24,600 --> 00:37:28,259
I will bear in mind that I'm an assistant.

562
00:37:30,180 --> 00:37:32,180
Just a temporary one.

563
00:37:32,180 --> 00:37:36,239
When I get back to Pediatrics, you'll still be my superior.

564
00:37:46,020 --> 00:37:50,520
In your opinion, do you put our working relationship

565
00:37:50,520 --> 00:37:52,980
ahead of our friendship?

566
00:37:54,420 --> 00:37:57,539
You are my superior during working hours.

567
00:37:58,379 --> 00:38:00,659
But in our leisure time, we're friends.

568
00:38:00,659 --> 00:38:02,800
Can you make it that clean?

569
00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:08,220
I'll do my best. I'm sure President can also distinguish between public and private.

570
00:38:08,740 --> 00:38:10,380
I can't.

571
00:38:14,299 --> 00:38:16,660
Am I your fake boyfriend or not?

572
00:38:17,220 --> 00:38:20,559
I'll find a time to make it clear with my mom.

573
00:38:20,559 --> 00:38:24,520
Besides, I won't tell Qiao Yu about it.

574
00:38:24,520 --> 00:38:26,339
You have my word.

575
00:38:36,420 --> 00:38:39,839
Ye Shilan. Impressive!

576
00:38:39,839 --> 00:38:41,279
What?

577
00:38:41,279 --> 00:38:44,379
Superior, friend, fake boyfriend.

578
00:38:44,379 --> 00:38:45,980
You make it so clear.

579
00:38:45,980 --> 00:38:48,220
Switching between identities so smoothly.

580
00:38:48,220 --> 00:38:51,380
Even Mrs. Ji would be impressed.

581
00:38:52,059 --> 00:38:56,020
Sounds like you're mocking me.

582
00:38:56,940 --> 00:38:59,979
Not at all! I've learned my lesson.

583
00:39:04,020 --> 00:39:06,738
President, it's time to go.

584
00:39:06,738 --> 00:39:08,360
Okay.

585
00:39:23,339 --> 00:39:26,459
<i>Be sure to behave yourself when it comes to your relationships.</i>

586
00:39:26,459 --> 00:39:29,400
<i>Always be aware of your identity.</i>

587
00:39:29,400 --> 00:39:33,059
<i>Try to figure out if others they are flattering you,</i>

588
00:39:33,059 --> 00:39:35,800
<i>afraid of you,</i>

589
00:39:35,800 --> 00:39:38,520
<i>or fond of you.</i>

590
00:39:43,139 --> 00:39:45,800
Say what you have to say.

591
00:39:45,800 --> 00:39:48,840
I overheard your conversation.

592
00:39:48,840 --> 00:39:50,260
And?

593
00:39:50,260 --> 00:39:52,660
Beware of eavesdroppers.

594
00:39:55,859 --> 00:39:58,219
Aren't you curious?

595
00:39:58,219 --> 00:40:00,179
I am.

596
00:40:00,179 --> 00:40:01,580
May I ask?

597
00:40:01,580 --> 00:40:02,959
Go ahead.

598
00:40:02,959 --> 00:40:05,039
Why fake boyfriend?

599
00:40:05,039 --> 00:40:09,520
For some reason, she told her mom that she had a boyfriend.

600
00:40:09,520 --> 00:40:11,640
I was helping her out.

601
00:40:11,640 --> 00:40:13,919
Do you have a crush on her?

602
00:40:15,579 --> 00:40:17,379
Why do you ask?

603
00:40:17,379 --> 00:40:19,339
It usually develops like this.

604
00:40:23,059 --> 00:40:24,840
Are you serious?

605
00:40:28,539 --> 00:40:29,818
Are you fond of Ye Shilan?

606
00:40:29,818 --> 00:40:32,499
Yes. Is there a problem?

607
00:40:34,740 --> 00:40:36,339
Not at all.

608
00:40:36,339 --> 00:40:38,800
I just didn't expect you to admit it.

609
00:40:40,299 --> 00:40:43,700
It's not a shame to love someone.

610
00:40:43,700 --> 00:40:45,800
Is Ye Shilan aware?

611
00:40:46,700 --> 00:40:51,039
I gave her a hint. I'm afraid she thought I was talking about Qiao Yu.

612
00:40:51,039 --> 00:40:53,259
Is she jealous?

613
00:40:53,940 --> 00:40:55,540
I can't tell.

614
00:40:55,540 --> 00:40:57,860
Why not say it out?

615
00:40:58,900 --> 00:41:03,340
Not sure. I'm afraid she only treats me as a friend.

616
00:41:03,340 --> 00:41:07,300
That's so typical of you. Only strike when fully prepared.

617
00:41:08,020 --> 00:41:10,600
But a relationship is different from work.

618
00:41:10,600 --> 00:41:13,679
Total control is impossible.

619
00:41:16,840 --> 00:41:19,499
But now I'm completely clueless.

620
00:41:19,499 --> 00:41:23,999
Now I'm stuck in it. But she gets out of it as if nothing happened.

621
00:41:25,920 --> 00:41:30,260
If I didn't know her, I'd think she was deceiving you.

622
00:41:32,619 --> 00:41:35,379
If only she could deceive me.

623
00:41:35,940 --> 00:41:37,999
I can't wait.

624
00:41:37,999 --> 00:41:42,900
Calm down. Maybe she's more diplomatic than you are.

625
00:41:44,660 --> 00:41:49,740
Everyone can tell you like each other. But you won't admit it.

626
00:41:52,779 --> 00:41:55,039
How strange! You speak nicely today.

627
00:41:55,039 --> 00:41:58,300
It wasn't me. I heard it from Prime Minister Gui.

628
00:41:59,619 --> 00:42:02,620
Prime Minister? Which dynasty is he from?

629
00:42:02,620 --> 00:42:04,860
Fictional world.
