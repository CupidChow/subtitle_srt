<i>[Episode 12]</i>

16
00:01:36,439 --> 00:01:38,020
Come in.

17
00:01:38,900 --> 00:01:41,899
President, Miss Ji's assistant just replied that

18
00:01:41,899 --> 00:01:44,799
she hoped to see the plan on WeChat first,

19
00:01:44,799 --> 00:01:48,540
and then she'll decide whether to meet or not.

20
00:01:48,540 --> 00:01:51,600
I intended to rise to the occasion at the meeting,

21
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:53,920
but she won't give us the chance.

22
00:01:54,520 --> 00:01:56,738
What about this? Go and ask Assistant Lin

23
00:01:56,738 --> 00:02:00,498
for a few feasible plans first and then send them over to see the other party's reaction.

24
00:02:00,498 --> 00:02:01,720
Okay.

25
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:06,520
By the way, Assistant Lin said many emails have been just received in the President's Email box.

26
00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:07,918
Get its account and password,

27
00:02:07,919 --> 00:02:09,539
comb out, comment on relevant questions,

28
00:02:09,539 --> 00:02:11,840
and send them to me.

29
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:13,479
Okay.

30
00:02:13,479 --> 00:02:17,060
President, do you want to have a working meal together at noon?

31
00:02:18,099 --> 00:02:19,331
Noon is not good for me.

32
00:02:19,331 --> 00:02:22,140
I'll go out with Assistant Lin in an hour.

33
00:02:23,320 --> 00:02:24,799
Are you free tonight?

34
00:02:24,799 --> 00:02:26,920
If necessary, I'm free.

35
00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:28,940
I'll call you when it's done.

36
00:02:28,940 --> 00:02:32,039
Well, I'll go out then.

37
00:02:38,199 --> 00:02:40,220
Do you want to recommend Dr. Zeng?

38
00:02:40,220 --> 00:02:42,420
Any problem with that?

39
00:02:43,659 --> 00:02:46,100
Because of Assistant Ye?

40
00:02:46,100 --> 00:02:47,860
Of course not.

41
00:02:47,860 --> 00:02:50,880
Doesn't she praise Dr. Jiang all the time?

42
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:54,319
So you are jealous?

43
00:02:54,319 --> 00:02:56,839
Do you think I don't distinguish between public and private?

44
00:02:57,700 --> 00:02:59,360
Maybe not on purpose,

45
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:03,160
but you inevitably have likes and dislikes that may affect judgment.

46
00:03:06,620 --> 00:03:10,139
I see that you have done some research on emotional matters.

47
00:03:10,139 --> 00:03:15,618
Analyze for me why Ye Shilan still can't forget Jiang Huaimin

48
00:03:15,618 --> 00:03:18,219
after knowing he has a girlfriend?

49
00:03:19,099 --> 00:03:21,419
Love can't be controlled.

50
00:03:21,419 --> 00:03:25,220
You won't be able to step on the brakes at any time just because the road is blocked.

51
00:03:26,220 --> 00:03:28,579
Then she'll run into them.

52
00:03:28,579 --> 00:03:31,320
That's why there are so many immoral love affairs.

53
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:35,719
Ye Shilan isn't that kind of girl.

54
00:03:35,719 --> 00:03:38,260
I'm thinking of a possibility.

55
00:03:39,579 --> 00:03:41,359
Any other possibility?

56
00:03:41,939 --> 00:03:44,480
She took a detour and drove to the next intersection to wait.

57
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:47,060
That is the legendary spare tire.

58
00:03:49,999 --> 00:03:52,419
It's not the first day for you to know it.

59
00:03:52,419 --> 00:03:54,719
Why are you suddenly so concerned?

60
00:03:57,600 --> 00:03:59,279
It's just a casual chat.

61
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:01,824
I know you're friends.

62
00:04:01,824 --> 00:04:04,040
It's normal for you to care.

63
00:04:04,700 --> 00:04:07,120
I've always been like this with my friends.

64
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:11,199
Why don't you be more loyal and righteous to Assistant Ye,

65
00:04:11,199 --> 00:04:14,439
and make her realize that there are other options in this world?

66
00:04:15,439 --> 00:04:18,639
Sounds right, but there is no need to court her.

67
00:04:18,639 --> 00:04:21,940
I'll try to care for her, and be nicer to her.

68
00:04:21,940 --> 00:04:24,060
Isn't that courting?

69
00:04:27,919 --> 00:04:29,940
I was chatted to death by you again!

70
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:36,480
Dr. Ye.

71
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:39,578
Dr. Zeng, are you looking for President?

72
00:04:39,578 --> 00:04:41,139
He's not here.

73
00:04:41,139 --> 00:04:43,000
I'm here for you.

74
00:04:44,739 --> 00:04:49,518
I'm learning baking. I baked some cookies for my Pediatric colleagues.

75
00:04:49,518 --> 00:04:51,340
This is for you.

76
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:54,139
Thank you.

77
00:04:55,299 --> 00:04:58,600
Dr. Ye, thank you for what happened to our department.

78
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:01,479
I should have thanked you earlier,

79
00:05:01,479 --> 00:05:03,739
but I was ashamed to do it.

80
00:05:03,739 --> 00:05:06,699
Besides, I'm casual with my words.

81
00:05:06,699 --> 00:05:11,499
I want to apologize for my previous offensive deeds against you.

82
00:05:11,499 --> 00:05:14,040
You don't have to.

83
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:16,520
I feel better after telling you.

84
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:19,978
In fact, I also wronged you before.

85
00:05:19,978 --> 00:05:21,280
Please forgive me.

86
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:25,419
Don't say that. When you come back to our department, let's have a good talk.

87
00:05:25,419 --> 00:05:26,459
Okay.

88
00:05:26,459 --> 00:05:29,279
Well, I won't bother you.

89
00:05:30,699 --> 00:05:32,359
Dr. Zeng!

90
00:05:36,359 --> 00:05:39,900
Does our department have a WeChat group chat?

91
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:43,799
Can you... add me to it?

92
00:05:44,900 --> 00:05:46,519
Done!

93
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:08,560
Assistant Ye, have a rest.

94
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:10,499
Have some fruit.

95
00:06:10,499 --> 00:06:12,480
Thanks, Auntie.

96
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:17,399
- Here you are.
- Thanks.

97
00:06:18,079 --> 00:06:22,139
Auntie, I don't know how to bake, so I can't do you any favors.

98
00:06:22,139 --> 00:06:24,759
It's simple indeed. I'll find a chance to teach you.

99
00:06:24,759 --> 00:06:26,459
Great.

100
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:29,480
Have some more; don't be polite.

101
00:06:30,639 --> 00:06:33,440
How's your work going?

102
00:06:34,419 --> 00:06:37,499
President assigned me some new tasks.

103
00:06:37,499 --> 00:06:40,119
Life is more fruitful when busy.

104
00:06:40,119 --> 00:06:43,560
Are you on good terms with Zhaoxi?

105
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:45,639
It's pretty good.

106
00:06:45,639 --> 00:06:48,540
Sorry to make a scene before you the first time.

107
00:06:48,540 --> 00:06:51,239
Both of you have strong personalities.

108
00:06:51,239 --> 00:06:53,860
It's normal to quarrel.

109
00:06:53,860 --> 00:06:56,878
After knowing each other, you'll be even closer.

110
00:06:56,878 --> 00:06:59,220
That's right.

111
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:05,380
Ye, do you have a boyfriend?

112
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:10,758
I'm not serious. It's okay if you don't want to tell me.

113
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:13,100
Not a big deal.

114
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:17,139
I had one before but not for long.

115
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:22,640
So what kind of boy do you like?

116
00:07:22,640 --> 00:07:25,860
Auntie, are you going to find me a boyfriend?

117
00:07:25,860 --> 00:07:30,439
Auntie knows no other boy but Zhaoxi.

118
00:07:30,439 --> 00:07:32,679
Do you like him?

119
00:07:32,679 --> 00:07:36,900
President is great, but he may not like me.

120
00:07:36,900 --> 00:07:40,539
How come? I think you're pretty good.

121
00:07:40,539 --> 00:07:42,899
Auntie, it's not good or bad that decides

122
00:07:42,899 --> 00:07:46,940
one who likes another or not, but the feelings.

123
00:07:46,940 --> 00:07:49,558
That's it. They can't be forced.

124
00:07:49,558 --> 00:07:51,250
Here you are.

125
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,918
- I could do it myself.
- I peeled them especially for you.

126
00:07:54,918 --> 00:07:56,599
Thanks, Auntie.

127
00:07:58,100 --> 00:08:00,499
The bread is being baked. I've nothing else to do.

128
00:08:00,499 --> 00:08:03,720
I'm happy talking with you.

129
00:08:04,699 --> 00:08:10,180
Auntie, I guess President must have had a lot of girlfriends.

130
00:08:10,940 --> 00:08:14,484
As far as I know, he's been single for a long time.

131
00:08:14,484 --> 00:08:15,759
What about before then?

132
00:08:15,759 --> 00:08:20,260
He did have one or two but not for long. The same as you.

133
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:24,000
Zhaoxi isn't a playboy.

134
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:27,078
He didn't know much about love at the time and felt that it was the right chemistry,

135
00:08:27,078 --> 00:08:29,918
so they were together, but he realized that it wasn't love.

136
00:08:29,918 --> 00:08:33,020
After several times, he became rather cautious.

137
00:08:33,020 --> 00:08:36,119
Sounds like he was hurt in love.

138
00:08:36,119 --> 00:08:38,699
Right. That's why I'm worried.

139
00:08:38,699 --> 00:08:41,039
How come you're so worried?

140
00:08:45,170 --> 00:08:47,090
President.

141
00:08:47,090 --> 00:08:49,810
<i>Go and buy a gift with me this evening.</i>

142
00:08:50,379 --> 00:08:53,000
<i>Okay, as you say.</i>

143
00:08:54,069 --> 00:08:56,250
<i>Do I have to pick you up?</i>

144
00:08:57,159 --> 00:08:59,299
<i>I'll go there by taxi.</i>

145
00:09:01,319 --> 00:09:04,220
<i>Good, you're flexible now.</i>

146
00:09:06,980 --> 00:09:10,179
President asked me to buy a gift with him tonight.

147
00:09:10,179 --> 00:09:12,519
How can he bother you at night for such a matter?

148
00:09:12,519 --> 00:09:16,638
I'm his assistant. It's part of my job.

149
00:09:19,019 --> 00:09:22,760
Ye, let me tell you a secret.

150
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:30,820
<i>[Time Garden Cafe]</i>

151
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:36,340
Welcome.

152
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:39,340
Hello, can I help you?

153
00:09:39,340 --> 00:09:41,699
I want a bacon sandwich. Takeout.

154
00:09:41,699 --> 00:09:43,400
Okay.

155
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:48,598
39 yuan. Please scan your QR code.

156
00:09:48,599 --> 00:09:50,080
Okay.

157
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:54,620
Hello.

158
00:09:54,620 --> 00:09:56,841
Hello, isn't Yao Jiajia here?

159
00:09:56,841 --> 00:09:58,530
She asked for three days off.

160
00:09:58,530 --> 00:10:02,558
She said she was unlucky after being chased by a dog and falling down.

161
00:10:07,059 --> 00:10:09,439
This is your sandwich. Welcome to you next time.

162
00:10:09,439 --> 00:10:11,019
Thanks.

163
00:10:39,719 --> 00:10:41,980
Why were you in a trance?

164
00:10:42,719 --> 00:10:46,019
I felt a sense of illusory happiness.

165
00:10:47,946 --> 00:10:52,159
Like being waited for by my boyfriend to go eating and shopping after a day's work.

166
00:10:52,159 --> 00:10:55,540
Life seemed quite beautiful.

167
00:11:00,860 --> 00:11:02,699
You're really into the show.

168
00:11:03,420 --> 00:11:06,220
Why didn't you wait inside a cafe?

169
00:11:06,900 --> 00:11:10,598
My girlfriend looked forward to seeing me on getting out of the taxi.

170
00:11:10,598 --> 00:11:12,120
How happy would she be!

171
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:14,579
You really can't lose.

172
00:11:15,300 --> 00:11:16,919
Let's go.

173
00:11:25,039 --> 00:11:30,580
President, do you want a gift for a boy or a girl?

174
00:11:30,580 --> 00:11:34,840
A rather special girl, so I ask you here for a reference.

175
00:11:35,880 --> 00:11:39,000
What's her dressing style?

176
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:42,439
Simple and elegant, sometimes a bit lovely,

177
00:11:42,439 --> 00:11:45,079
so it's better to pick something special.

178
00:11:45,079 --> 00:11:47,479
Lovely?

179
00:11:50,359 --> 00:11:53,039
Is she your crush?

180
00:11:55,640 --> 00:11:59,200
I haven't heard about her from you.

181
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:01,200
It's been many years.

182
00:12:04,279 --> 00:12:06,259
Let's have a look.

183
00:12:08,019 --> 00:12:11,839
Hello. Who are you buying for? I can recommend something for you.

184
00:12:11,839 --> 00:12:13,439
Is it for this pretty lady?

185
00:12:13,439 --> 00:12:15,938
- No.
- It's for my mom.

186
00:12:15,938 --> 00:12:17,820
My girlfriend is helping me choose.

187
00:12:17,820 --> 00:12:19,059
Let us browse around first.

188
00:12:19,059 --> 00:12:20,679
Okay.

189
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:25,518
Why so mysterious? Just for your mom.

190
00:12:25,518 --> 00:12:27,039
I did not lie.

191
00:12:27,039 --> 00:12:29,920
I just wanted to test your reaction.

192
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:33,940
If I were your girlfriend, you'd not dare to say so.

193
00:12:38,519 --> 00:12:40,300
What about this?

194
00:12:41,019 --> 00:12:42,839
Looks nice.

195
00:12:42,839 --> 00:12:46,539
This one works really well on the upper body. You can try it on.

196
00:12:46,539 --> 00:12:48,100
Would you mind?

197
00:12:49,300 --> 00:12:51,420
No. Let me try it.

198
00:12:59,259 --> 00:13:02,339
It's not that easy to put it on. Please do her a favor.

199
00:13:22,359 --> 00:13:23,659
Don't move.

200
00:13:23,659 --> 00:13:26,060
- Don't tremble.
- I'm not trembling.

201
00:13:26,060 --> 00:13:28,320
Your hands are clumsy.

202
00:13:30,039 --> 00:13:32,740
She said it wasn't easy.

203
00:13:35,359 --> 00:13:36,800
Let me try.

204
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:38,550
Here.

205
00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:47,784
It's because you have clumsy hands.

206
00:13:47,784 --> 00:13:49,497
What do you think?

207
00:13:51,819 --> 00:13:53,840
You can have a look.

208
00:13:57,259 --> 00:13:59,139
I can't tell for sure.

209
00:13:59,139 --> 00:14:02,780
Tell me more about your mom's style.

210
00:14:02,780 --> 00:14:04,699
You saw Auntie Peng many times.

211
00:14:04,699 --> 00:14:06,519
They're quite alike.

212
00:14:07,919 --> 00:14:12,080
Well, I don't feel it fits her.

213
00:14:12,839 --> 00:14:16,180
We have many limited editions for your reference.

214
00:14:16,180 --> 00:14:17,540
Okay.

215
00:14:19,660 --> 00:14:23,979
We're a flagship store. Your pick will be available in a day or two.

216
00:14:25,340 --> 00:14:26,919
This...

217
00:14:34,359 --> 00:14:38,699
You've bought the gift. What do you want to do next?

218
00:14:38,699 --> 00:14:42,298
Nothing. I can accompany you if you want to go shopping.

219
00:14:42,298 --> 00:14:45,978
So great. I'm going to get carried away.

220
00:14:45,978 --> 00:14:47,900
Carried away?

221
00:14:49,459 --> 00:14:51,999
Whenever something good happened to me when I was a kid,

222
00:14:51,999 --> 00:14:54,659
I'd jump excitedly,

223
00:14:54,659 --> 00:14:59,279
fall down, hit my head, and make trouble.

224
00:14:59,279 --> 00:15:02,159
Every time I was like this, my mom would remind me:

225
00:15:02,159 --> 00:15:04,619
"Lanlan, don't be carried away with success."

226
00:15:04,619 --> 00:15:08,660
If not with success, when should we be carried away?

227
00:15:09,220 --> 00:15:12,299
Just to always keep vigilant.

228
00:15:12,299 --> 00:15:16,220
Because when good things come, bad things will follow.

229
00:15:16,220 --> 00:15:18,680
You are too pessimistic.

230
00:15:19,379 --> 00:15:23,099
It's not pessimistic, but a lesson I've learned many times.

231
00:15:25,359 --> 00:15:29,440
I think you can think about it the other way around.

232
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:35,039
When bad news takes place, good news may be on the way.

233
00:15:37,860 --> 00:15:39,660
Maybe so.

234
00:15:47,839 --> 00:15:52,079
You're so close to Auntie Peng.

235
00:15:52,079 --> 00:15:55,340
Yeah, she watched me grow up.

236
00:15:56,980 --> 00:16:00,909
Auntie Peng said the next time when I was free, she'd teach me how to bake.

237
00:16:02,680 --> 00:16:04,460
You seem so close.

238
00:16:04,460 --> 00:16:06,159
Maybe so.

239
00:16:07,037 --> 00:16:08,499
What do you usually talk about?

240
00:16:08,499 --> 00:16:10,040
About you.

241
00:16:10,040 --> 00:16:11,740
What about me?

242
00:16:11,740 --> 00:16:16,580
Auntie Peng said you were hurt in love.

243
00:16:18,619 --> 00:16:20,179
Why don't I know about it?

244
00:16:20,179 --> 00:16:23,599
Many people don't realize such things themselves.

245
00:16:23,599 --> 00:16:25,899
Don't listen to my mom...

246
00:16:27,059 --> 00:16:30,200
I guess it was my mom who told Auntie Peng.

247
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:33,079
You know my mom is always exaggerating,

248
00:16:33,079 --> 00:16:35,600
worrying about nothing but my love affairs.

249
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:37,590
It's all in her daily imagination.

250
00:16:37,599 --> 00:16:39,159
Leave her alone.

251
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:43,060
I think Auntie Peng is quite right.

252
00:16:43,060 --> 00:16:45,228
She analyzed your thinking.

253
00:16:45,228 --> 00:16:46,859
It doesn't look like she heard it from others.

254
00:16:46,859 --> 00:16:49,053
Auntie Peng didn't finish her junior high school education.

255
00:16:49,053 --> 00:16:51,360
How can she analyze my thinking?

256
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:53,980
It must be my mom who told her.

257
00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:03,100
You know it all?

258
00:17:04,159 --> 00:17:06,560
Your mom told me herself.

259
00:17:08,723 --> 00:17:11,282
She asked me to keep it a secret from you, but she sold me out.

260
00:17:11,282 --> 00:17:13,219
There she goes.

261
00:17:13,219 --> 00:17:17,439
Your mom gave me a tip to apologize,

262
00:17:17,439 --> 00:17:19,640
to see you embarrassed.

263
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:21,758
But I'm still not as strong as you.

264
00:17:21,758 --> 00:17:23,680
I couldn't hide it.

265
00:17:24,239 --> 00:17:27,178
Apologize by embarrassing me? She really is my mom.

266
00:17:27,178 --> 00:17:28,878
You two are quite alike in that.

267
00:17:28,878 --> 00:17:32,498
It's not it. Otherwise, how can I say that I am her apprentice?

268
00:17:32,498 --> 00:17:34,320
I'll be your apprentice.

269
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:38,180
But you dwarf me. I can't even suppress you.

270
00:17:43,960 --> 00:17:46,199
When my mother was the leader of the group before,

271
00:17:46,199 --> 00:17:49,158
she was always in a hurry, and now you can't even tell.

272
00:17:49,158 --> 00:17:50,618
Agreed.

273
00:17:50,618 --> 00:17:54,900
Now she's just a simple, unadorned, and easy-going auntie.

274
00:17:54,900 --> 00:17:59,959
She also suddenly wanted to change her way of life in the past two years, and now she's free.

275
00:17:59,959 --> 00:18:02,660
It's easy to become obsessed with past achievements.

276
00:18:02,660 --> 00:18:06,240
It's so cool of her to cast it aside.

277
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:09,160
Yes, I do admire her.

278
00:18:13,099 --> 00:18:15,100
If you like, just try it on.

279
00:18:15,100 --> 00:18:16,880
No way.

280
00:18:33,174 --> 00:18:34,140
♫ <i>Shubi duba</i> ♫

281
00:18:34,140 --> 00:18:35,680
What do you think?

282
00:18:35,680 --> 00:18:37,880
♫ <i>Shubi du</i> ♫

283

291
00:19:04,878 --> 00:19:06,679
That dress was so beautiful.

292
00:19:06,679 --> 00:19:08,600
Why didn't you buy it?

293
00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:11,879
A bit expensive. I'll buy it once I'm paid this month.

294
00:19:11,879 --> 00:19:13,919
I could have lent you the money.

295
00:19:13,919 --> 00:19:15,800
I have a deposit.

296
00:19:15,800 --> 00:19:20,238
I just set myself a certain income percentage to reward myself.

297
00:19:20,238 --> 00:19:22,320
I can't spend it lavishly.

298
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:25,200
Your life is so well-planned.

299
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:27,360
There is really no plan.

300
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:30,200
I just want to buy a house of my own.

301
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:32,959
Why do you insist on buying a house?

302
00:19:33,999 --> 00:19:38,839
Because I feel like I don't have a family of my own.

303
00:19:42,739 --> 00:19:45,899
Are you on bad terms with your Uncle Xie?

304
00:19:46,619 --> 00:19:50,939
It's not bad, but it's unfamiliar.

305
00:19:50,939 --> 00:19:53,680
In junior high, I went to a boarding school.

306
00:19:53,680 --> 00:19:58,399
When I grew up, I seldom went back during the winter and summer vacations because of work-study programs.

307
00:19:58,399 --> 00:20:02,300
So I had less communication with Uncle Xie and my younger brother.

308
00:20:03,999 --> 00:20:06,540
Do you think it's not your home?

309
00:20:08,519 --> 00:20:12,420
It's home to Mom, Uncle Xie, and brother.

310
00:20:16,900 --> 00:20:20,460
Is it weird of me to think so?

311
00:20:20,979 --> 00:20:22,660
It's also unfair to my mom.

312
00:20:24,840 --> 00:20:26,180
Not at all.

313
00:20:26,180 --> 00:20:30,039
Any deep feeling has its cause.

314
00:20:45,480 --> 00:20:47,759
Thank you for driving me home, President.

315
00:20:48,499 --> 00:20:50,460
Have you ever learned to drive?

316
00:20:50,460 --> 00:20:53,918
I got my driving license in college, got it renewed once,

317
00:20:53,918 --> 00:20:56,500
but I never drove.

318
00:20:56,500 --> 00:20:58,259
So why did you bother to get it?

319
00:20:58,259 --> 00:21:02,939
At that time, I thought about being a part-time driver or something.

320
00:21:04,139 --> 00:21:08,180
As your boyfriend for now, I ought to drive you home;

321
00:21:08,180 --> 00:21:12,819
but as my assistant, is it right for you to let me send you back often?

322
00:21:15,239 --> 00:21:17,300
I'll take you to practice driving when I have time.

323
00:21:17,300 --> 00:21:18,900
Really?

324
00:21:19,279 --> 00:21:21,420
When have I lied to you?

325
00:21:23,099 --> 00:21:26,339
Thank you. I'll go home now.

326
00:21:26,339 --> 00:21:28,080
President, bye.

327
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:29,800
Good night.

I told you last time to make Ye Shilan clear, and you said it was a secret.

338
00:22:08,238 --> 00:22:09,939
How could you change so suddenly?

339
00:22:09,939 --> 00:22:12,939
<i>Because I thought you two had chemistry.</i>

340
00:22:13,660 --> 00:22:15,260
So you betrayed me?

341
00:22:15,260 --> 00:22:18,198
<i>I just briefed her on your love history</i>

<i>without speaking ill of you.</i>

343
00:22:20,339 --> 00:22:22,499
Did she share hers with you?

344
00:22:22,499 --> 00:22:27,199
<i>Yes, she did have a boyfriend but not for long.</i>

345
00:22:29,279 --> 00:22:32,159
She said her unrequited love confession was refused.

346
00:22:32,159 --> 00:22:34,160
When did she have a boyfriend?

347
00:22:34,160 --> 00:22:36,040
<i>I don't know.</i>

348
00:22:36,839 --> 00:22:39,879
I'm not asking you. I was just talking to myself.

<i>If you're in need, I can help you.</i>

350
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:46,380
Just don't sell me out.

351
00:22:46,380 --> 00:22:49,398
Go to bed early. I need to sleep.

352
00:22:50,420 --> 00:22:51,420

362
00:23:37,119 --> 00:23:43,119
You're more like a real couple.

363
00:23:43,119 --> 00:23:45,579
Why does it sound so different

364
00:23:45,579 --> 00:23:48,260
when it's said by you?

365
00:23:48,260 --> 00:23:50,500
I think you're doing the right thing.

366
00:23:50,500 --> 00:23:51,859
What thing?

367
00:23:51,859 --> 00:23:54,439
You two are both single.

368
00:23:54,439 --> 00:23:58,118
Chemistry is acceptable. You're happy when playing a couple.

369
00:23:58,118 --> 00:24:01,959
Though I'm not sure if you like each other, it doesn't matter.

370
00:24:01,959 --> 00:24:04,278
What matters is your happiness is real.

371
00:24:04,278 --> 00:24:06,520
You're not at a loss.

372
00:24:08,139 --> 00:24:10,520
Does that make sense?

373
00:24:11,080 --> 00:24:14,940
In case there is another collision, there will be a little spark of love,

374
00:24:14,940 --> 00:24:17,099
you'll win at a profit.

375
00:24:17,720 --> 00:24:21,640
I think you're a born businesswoman.

376
00:24:21,640 --> 00:24:23,979
That's what I think.

377
00:24:23,979 --> 00:24:26,459
After this, I decide to

378
00:24:26,459 --> 00:24:29,998
open a tiny cafe of my own when I get enough money.

379
00:24:29,998 --> 00:24:32,998
I'll hire an employee who loves to read romance novels,

380
00:24:32,998 --> 00:24:36,300
and can write at the center of my cafe openly.

381
00:24:36,300 --> 00:24:38,018
I'll see who dares to threaten me.

382
00:24:38,018 --> 00:24:42,579
President Yao, I think the idea is brilliant.

383
00:24:42,579 --> 00:24:44,470
I'll buy your shares.

384
00:24:44,470 --> 00:24:46,699
President Ye's so generous.

385
00:24:46,699 --> 00:24:49,278
Come on. Grand opening!

386
00:24:50,420 --> 00:24:52,560
Grand opening!

387
00:24:54,580 --> 00:24:56,159
Come in.

388
00:25:02,159 --> 00:25:03,359
You bought cookies?

389
00:25:03,359 --> 00:25:06,839
Dr. Zeng made these, and gave me some.

390
00:25:06,839 --> 00:25:09,490
Didn't you say you were not close to your colleagues?

391
00:25:09,490 --> 00:25:12,899
I didn't get on well with Dr. Zeng,

392
00:25:12,899 --> 00:25:15,179
but she thanked me for last time's case.

393
00:25:15,179 --> 00:25:18,359
I think she's quite frank, not bad in nature.

394
00:25:18,359 --> 00:25:21,960
I will listen to your advice and will try to get on well with my colleagues.

395
00:25:21,960 --> 00:25:24,180
Did she ask you to recommend her to me?

396
00:25:24,180 --> 00:25:25,700
No.

397
00:25:28,660 --> 00:25:32,140
In fact, I know your concern.

398
00:25:32,140 --> 00:25:34,019
But before being confirmed,

399
00:25:34,019 --> 00:25:37,579
I still believe she has a pure purpose.

400
00:25:37,579 --> 00:25:41,059
Yes, always see the silver lining.

401
00:25:41,059 --> 00:25:42,939
I should learn from you.

402
00:25:42,939 --> 00:25:46,900
So I will also recommend Dr. Zeng to the producer.

403
00:25:50,959 --> 00:25:54,180
Aren't you surprised about why I didn't recommend Dr. Jiang?

404
00:25:55,139 --> 00:25:58,180
It must have been well-considered.

405
00:25:58,180 --> 00:26:00,099
I'll go out now.

406
00:26:06,900 --> 00:26:09,180
She is really watertight.

407
00:26:23,599 --> 00:26:27,738
I saw Assistant Lin come to Dr. Zeng especially this morning for further information.

408
00:26:27,738 --> 00:26:30,099
It must be her.

409
00:26:32,060 --> 00:26:35,460
What don't I turn to my uncle and fight for you?

410
00:26:36,999 --> 00:26:38,960
Don't bother President Xu.

411
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:42,419
I know this producer is quite capable.

412
00:26:42,419 --> 00:26:44,878
The documentary is sure to be popular.

413
00:26:44,878 --> 00:26:47,339
You've been working on your Weibo's influence.

414
00:26:47,339 --> 00:26:50,119
This is a golden chance.

415
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:54,679
But it's unfair to Dr. Zeng.

416
00:26:54,679 --> 00:26:56,719
I know your worries.

417
00:26:56,719 --> 00:26:59,400
I get on quite well with Dr. Zeng,

418
00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:03,280
but the situation now is unfair to you.

419
00:27:03,280 --> 00:27:05,199
What do you mean?

420
00:27:07,900 --> 00:27:10,400
Dr. Ye has been back for some time.

421
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:12,739
There's a rumor among colleagues.

422
00:27:12,739 --> 00:27:15,618
I won't ask if you don't want to talk about it.

423
00:27:15,618 --> 00:27:18,079
I'll pretend as if it never happened

424
00:27:18,079 --> 00:27:21,639
because I think it won't affect us,

425
00:27:22,239 --> 00:27:23,918
but now it's different.

426
00:27:23,918 --> 00:27:25,918
Dr. Ye is President's assistant.

427
00:27:25,918 --> 00:27:28,379
If she holds a grudge against you,

428
00:27:28,379 --> 00:27:32,500
she can speak ill of you before the President.

429
00:27:32,500 --> 00:27:34,380
She isn't that kind of person.

430
00:27:35,080 --> 00:27:37,419
You trust her so much.

431
00:27:51,279 --> 00:27:54,820
Zhining, I'm sorry.

432
00:27:54,820 --> 00:27:57,897
I flinched. I didn't tell you the truth.

433
00:27:57,897 --> 00:28:00,400
I know the past won't affect us.

434
00:28:00,400 --> 00:28:02,747
I should have been honest with you.

435
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:06,380
In fact,

436
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:10,620
I didn't refuse her love confession.

437
00:28:10,620 --> 00:28:14,599
I did have a short-term relationship with Ye Shilan.

438
00:28:22,019 --> 00:28:27,500
Miss Ji replied quickly, but she didn't agree through rounds of communication.

439
00:28:31,800 --> 00:28:33,599
I also found out that

440
00:28:33,599 --> 00:28:35,520
there's a rumor online about her

441
00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:37,419
secret marriage and pregnancy.

442
00:28:37,419 --> 00:28:41,080
Days ago, her studio issued a statement to refute the rumor.

443
00:28:41,080 --> 00:28:42,960
This is even more troublesome.

444
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:45,890
She worries it'll be a slap in her face when this is exposed.

445
00:28:45,890 --> 00:28:49,040
I've seen all the proposals you suggested. There are no problems.

446
00:28:49,040 --> 00:28:53,999
I also persuaded her to change to another hospital, but she declined.

447
00:28:53,999 --> 00:28:58,639
Maybe she's used to being a star, and is spoiled by fans and staff,

448
00:28:58,639 --> 00:29:01,139
and feels the world revolves around her.

449
00:29:01,139 --> 00:29:04,020
Assistant Ye, what do you think?

450
00:29:04,639 --> 00:29:07,615
I think although she rejected our proposal,

451
00:29:07,615 --> 00:29:09,419
she didn't mean it.

452
00:29:09,419 --> 00:29:12,940
So there might be room for negotiations.

453
00:29:14,219 --> 00:29:16,580
Actually, I thought so, too.

454
00:29:17,060 --> 00:29:18,780
She already has a plan in her heart,

455
00:29:18,780 --> 00:29:22,279
she just wanted to wait until we figured it out before volunteering.

456
00:29:22,279 --> 00:29:26,158
So we have to figure out what she really wants.

457
00:29:26,158 --> 00:29:27,038
Exactly.

458
00:29:27,038 --> 00:29:29,420
Why play hide-and-seek?

459
00:29:30,239 --> 00:29:35,180
A pregnant star must be bored every day at home.

460
00:29:35,180 --> 00:29:38,039
If so, let's play a game with her.

461
00:29:38,039 --> 00:29:42,400
For a girl as famous and rich as Miss Ji,

462
00:29:42,400 --> 00:29:44,480
what does she want?

463
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:46,240
It's hard to tell.

464
00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:50,819
Some people's ideas get increasingly exotic when materially rich.

465
00:29:50,819 --> 00:29:55,999
In this way, you can sort out the contents of her interviews with the media in the past two years and let me have a look.

466
00:29:55,999 --> 00:29:58,998
I've sorted it out in advance and printed it out for you.

467
00:29:58,998 --> 00:30:01,900
Fast in reaction. Good judgment.

468
00:30:01,900 --> 00:30:04,200
Just learn from you.

469
00:30:05,339 --> 00:30:09,039
By the way, I'll go get the gift. It's available at the store.

470
00:30:09,039 --> 00:30:10,219
Okay.

471
00:30:10,219 --> 00:30:12,491
You'd better buy that dress as well.

472
00:30:12,491 --> 00:30:14,060
You've to buy it sooner or later.

473
00:30:14,060 --> 00:30:15,279
Put on and enjoy it early.

474
00:30:15,280 --> 00:30:18,579
No, I can't indulge myself, or I'll be addicted.

475
00:30:18,579 --> 00:30:19,780
Good self-control.

476
00:30:19,780 --> 00:30:23,599
It's not because of self-control, but poverty.

477
00:30:25,119 --> 00:30:28,419
If nothing else, I won't disturb you.

478
00:30:29,640 --> 00:30:31,179
I'm done here, too.

479
00:30:31,179 --> 00:30:33,219
I'll leave first.

480
00:30:41,680 --> 00:30:43,500
Why are you just standing there?

481
00:30:45,260 --> 00:30:47,239
Aren't you busy?

482
00:30:47,239 --> 00:30:50,559
Don't think about it all day long. Hurry.

483
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:52,920
Okay.

484
00:31:13,018 --> 00:31:14,060
Hello.

485

Who're you looking for?

President... Lu, is he here?

487
00:31:18,921 --> 00:31:20,320
I'm his friend.

488
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:21,980
He's in a meeting.

489
00:31:21,980 --> 00:31:23,379
Shall I send a message to him?

490
00:31:23,379 --> 00:31:26,378
No, thanks. I'll wait for him here.

Okay, thanks.

497
00:31:40,979 --> 00:31:42,999

Ye Shilan, a cup of coffee for me.

00:31:47,738 --> 00:31:49,080
Surprise!

501
00:31:49,080 --> 00:31:52,660
Qiao Yu! When did you come back?

502
00:31:52,660 --> 00:31:54,759
Several days ago. I wanted to surprise you

503
00:31:54,759 --> 00:31:56,489
- What a great surprise!
- Did you miss me?

504
00:31:56,489 --> 00:31:58,459
Of course. Let's talk inside.

505
00:31:58,459 --> 00:31:59,900
Okay.

506
00:32:01,939 --> 00:32:04,278
Ye Shilan, two cups of coffee.

Wait, one with oat milk.

508
00:32:06,382 --> 00:32:08,350
She's lactose intolerant.

509
00:32:09,920 --> 00:32:11,520
Okay.

510
00:32:11,520 --> 00:32:13,400
Hurry and come in.

511
00:32:24,099 --> 00:32:27,068
Are you used to being the president here?

512
00:32:27,069 --> 00:32:28,700
A hospital is unlike an ordinary company.

513
00:32:28,700 --> 00:32:31,539
I'm learning while getting used to it.

514
00:32:31,539 --> 00:32:34,518
To be honest, I'm not used to calling you President Lu.

515
00:32:34,600 --> 00:32:38,400
- Just call me by my name.
- Come in.

516
00:32:38,499 --> 00:32:43,558
Wait! It's weird to call you Lu Zhaoxi before your subordinates.

517
00:32:43,558 --> 00:32:45,650
It doesn't matter.

518
00:32:45,650 --> 00:32:47,600
Miss Qiao, your coffee.

519
00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:48,819
Thanks.

520
00:32:48,819 --> 00:32:51,639
I forgot to introduce you. She's my assistant Ye Shilan.

521
00:32:51,639 --> 00:32:54,139
She's my friend Qiao Yu.

522
00:32:54,139 --> 00:32:56,432
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

523
00:32:56,432 --> 00:32:58,359
I'll go out then.

524
00:32:59,480 --> 00:33:02,159
My mom misses you a lot. She invited you to a meal at my home some time.

525
00:33:02,159 --> 00:33:06,500
Is she going to persuade us to continue our relationship again?

526

Okay, then I'll go back now.

It's going to rain. Do you need an umbrella?

No, thanks. Someone will pick me up.

582
00:37:23,100 --> 00:37:24,578
I've put it away.

583
00:37:24,578 --> 00:37:26,800
I was so frightened.

584
00:37:30,779 --> 00:37:34,519
Sorry, I should have kept it well.

00:37:34,519 --> 00:37:36,160
Nothing was lost

586
00:37:36,160 --> 00:37:38,059
Take this as an example.

587
00:37:38,840 --> 00:37:41,478
Let me drive you home for a hot shower.

588
00:37:41,478 --> 00:37:43,139
Don't catch a cold.

589
00:37:43,139 --> 00:37:44,860
Don't we have an appointment?

590
00:37:44,860 --> 00:37:46,599
You are soaked, how can you meet others?

591
00:37:46,599 --> 00:37:49,879
I told them to make another appointment to meet next time.

592
00:37:50,719 --> 00:37:52,539
I'm sorry.

593
00:37:53,059 --> 00:37:54,538
Don't say sorry again.

594
00:37:54,538 --> 00:37:57,120
You did nothing wrong.

595
00:37:57,120 --> 00:37:58,659
Let's go.

596
00:38:10,880 --> 00:38:13,639
How come you have a blanket in your car?

597
00:38:13,639 --> 00:38:16,679
When fishing in the mountains, sometimes it's cold.

598
00:38:23,020 --> 00:38:25,639
Cover yourself with it.

599
00:38:25,639 --> 00:38:27,260
Okay.

600
00:38:28,239 --> 00:38:30,460
I'll return it after washing it clean.

601
00:38:30,460 --> 00:38:32,136
It doesn't matter.

602
00:38:33,679 --> 00:38:37,260
The sun comes out. It's sunny after the rain.

603
00:38:37,880 --> 00:38:42,579
For that family, you're the sun after the rain.

604
00:38:43,840 --> 00:38:45,680
Just a tiny favor.

605
00:38:45,680 --> 00:38:49,360
Other doctors will do so as well.

606
00:38:49,360 --> 00:38:52,890
But it was you just now, so you deserve such praise.

607
00:38:53,731 --> 00:38:58,440
I mean it's part of a doctor's professional attributes.

608
00:38:59,800 --> 00:39:03,979
A doctor is a noble profession in many people's minds.

609
00:39:06,460 --> 00:39:09,820
Actually, in my opinion,

610
00:39:09,820 --> 00:39:14,220
I think it's just a job like other professions.

611
00:39:14,220 --> 00:39:18,460
A doctor is like everyone else, an ordinary person.

612
00:39:21,059 --> 00:39:25,620
In many cases, people tend to sort groups out and label them,

613
00:39:25,620 --> 00:39:29,320
especially the noble ones.

614
00:39:29,320 --> 00:39:35,038
And most people often mix a noble profession with a noble individual.

615
00:39:35,859 --> 00:39:39,058
As an ordinary person, a doctor wants to be

616
00:39:39,058 --> 00:39:43,619
accordingly rewarded by working, buy what he or she likes, and live a decent life.

617
00:39:43,619 --> 00:39:45,840
It's the same as others.

618
00:39:45,840 --> 00:39:50,039
A doctor may be selfish, a coward,

619
00:39:50,039 --> 00:39:52,759
or imperfect with many disadvantages. They can also do wrong.

620
00:39:52,760 --> 00:39:54,120
It's the same for everyone.

621
00:39:55,640 --> 00:39:57,160
You're right.

622
00:39:57,160 --> 00:40:01,340
Morality cannot be forcibly attached to individual doctors.

623
00:40:01,340 --> 00:40:03,640
This is also a kind of moral kidnapping.

624
00:40:03,640 --> 00:40:05,660
Exactly.

625
00:40:05,660 --> 00:40:09,799
And I think just because a doctor feels the same as others,

626
00:40:09,799 --> 00:40:14,120
he or she can be more considerate when treating patients.

627
00:40:14,120 --> 00:40:16,538
Just because he or she isn't selfless,

628
00:40:16,538 --> 00:40:19,391
and has things to fear, a doctor can be more selfless

629
00:40:19,391 --> 00:40:21,630
and fearless at critical times.

630
00:40:21,630 --> 00:40:23,320
For example, when handling the pandemic,

631
00:40:23,320 --> 00:40:27,459
many medical practitioners countermarched and fought on the frontline.

632
00:40:27,459 --> 00:40:30,980
They lived up to their professional morality.

633
00:40:32,360 --> 00:40:36,688
I find that the more I know you, the more shining points I find you have.

634
00:40:40,900 --> 00:40:43,819
See? The rainbow!

635
00:40:45,719 --> 00:40:48,378
I'll find someplace to stop and take pictures.

636
00:40:48,378 --> 00:40:49,859
Great.

637
00:41:04,439 --> 00:41:06,479
