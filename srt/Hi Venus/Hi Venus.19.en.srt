<i>[Episode 19]</i>

16
00:01:30,340 --> 00:01:33,200
So does she like steamed buns?

17
00:01:33,839 --> 00:01:34,999
No, she doesn't.

18
00:01:34,999 --> 00:01:37,920
I learned to make buns for another girlfriend.

19
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:40,599
Why is your relationship like an apprenticeship?

20
00:01:40,599 --> 00:01:42,959
No, because...

21
00:01:42,959 --> 00:01:45,319
Su, makes it sound easy. Right?

22
00:01:45,319 --> 00:01:48,518
In fact, he took every relationship seriously.

23
00:01:48,519 --> 00:01:50,160
He's not a playboy.

24
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:53,338
Ye, don't worry. Don't misunderstand.

25
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,100
What does this have to do with me misunderstanding, Deputy Director?

26
00:01:57,119 --> 00:01:58,900
Don't you understand?

27
00:01:58,900 --> 00:02:02,379
Deputy Director means to match the two of you.

28
00:02:05,080 --> 00:02:07,499
Dr. Ye, what do you think of me?

29
00:02:14,220 --> 00:02:15,879
I don't really know you too well.

30
00:02:15,879 --> 00:02:17,579
Then you can get to know more about him.

31
00:02:17,579 --> 00:02:19,999
Deputy Director and I both think that Su is a nice man.

32
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,400
Right, Deputy Director?

33
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:23,480
Su is definitely a nice person.

34
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:26,079
Su, what do you know about Dr. Ye?

35
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:28,000
What do you think of her?

36
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,059
Directors, did mention a lot about her to me.

37
00:02:30,059 --> 00:02:31,779
But after meeting her,

38
00:02:31,779 --> 00:02:34,780
I found that she was not quite the same as I imagined.

39
00:02:34,780 --> 00:02:36,120
So what's the difference?

40
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:41,459
I thought Dr. Ye would be the type of sassy girlfriend.

41
00:02:41,459 --> 00:02:44,220
Maybe a little hot-tempered.

42
00:02:45,140 --> 00:02:49,260
It turns out that this is the image I have in both of your minds.

43
00:02:49,260 --> 00:02:51,118
No, no, no.

44
00:02:51,119 --> 00:02:54,659
To be honest, you've changed a lot from before now.

45
00:02:54,659 --> 00:02:56,160
- Right, Director.
- Exactly.

46
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:58,918
Ye, you've changed a lot since you got back.

47
00:02:58,919 --> 00:03:01,679
You've become more optimistic and you smile more than before.

48
00:03:01,679 --> 00:03:03,380
Is it that obvious?

49
00:03:03,380 --> 00:03:04,899
- How pretty you are when you smile.
- Indeed.

50
00:03:04,899 --> 00:03:06,838
You look beautiful when you smile.

51
00:03:06,839 --> 00:03:10,718
Dr. Ye, I did hear that falling in love will change a person.

52
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:13,379
You're not secretly dating someone, right?

53
00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:18,460
Why? Do you have a problem with it?

54
00:03:18,460 --> 00:03:22,320
Aren't you afraid that Su will waste his feelings. Right?

55
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:23,919
I'm not afraid.

56
00:03:23,919 --> 00:03:27,299
I believe that the process of giving affection to others is also receiving it.

57
00:03:27,299 --> 00:03:29,939
So it is not necessary to get a certain result.

58
00:03:29,939 --> 00:03:32,038
I strongly agree with Su's opinion.

59
00:03:32,039 --> 00:03:33,900
Love is not an investment.

60
00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:35,320
It can't be so utilitarian.

61
00:03:35,320 --> 00:03:38,780
Dr. Ye, can I hang out with you on vacation?

62
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:40,758
Sure.

63
00:03:40,759 --> 00:03:42,380
She might not have the time.

64
00:03:42,380 --> 00:03:43,899
Then I'll message you in advance.

65
00:03:43,899 --> 00:03:45,560
Actually. Okay.

66
00:03:46,119 --> 00:03:48,800
Lu, how about having another piece of meat?

67
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:50,819
I'm good, Deputy Director. Just eating half of it has already made me tired of it.

68
00:03:50,819 --> 00:03:52,038
You should have some more.

69
00:03:52,039 --> 00:03:54,460
Tired of it? Then have some cucumber.

70
00:03:54,460 --> 00:03:55,539
Thank you.

71
00:03:55,539 --> 00:03:56,980
No big deal.

72
00:04:07,399 --> 00:04:08,979
Are you still tired of it?

73
00:04:08,979 --> 00:04:12,019
Should I get you some vinegar?

74
00:04:12,019 --> 00:04:14,460
Will you eat steamed buns with vinegar?

75
00:04:14,460 --> 00:04:16,520
I thought you liked it.

76
00:04:17,179 --> 00:04:20,060
I usually like to eat sweet things to tempt my jaded palate.

77

Sorry for taking up your break time to help me check my draft.

85
00:04:57,878 --> 00:05:00,900
You promised that it was a special bonus for regular readers

86
00:05:00,900 --> 00:05:03,040
to read the next chapters in advance?

87
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:04,819
I was joking.

88
00:05:04,819 --> 00:05:06,539
I think this bonus is particularly good.

89
00:05:06,539 --> 00:05:10,040
I'll take it seriously, offering you my opinion.

Thank a million. The dinner is on me.

91
00:05:12,959 --> 00:05:14,280
Okay.

92
00:05:22,959 --> 00:05:25,279
Kid, what are you looking at?

93
00:05:25,279 --> 00:05:26,678
What're you writing?

94
00:05:26,679 --> 00:05:28,340
I'm writing...

95
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:31,279
what is not suitable for children.

96
00:05:40,559 --> 00:05:43,919
Kid, I can't write if you keep looking at me.

97
00:05:43,919 --> 00:05:45,359
Why?

98
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:47,600
I just can't.

99
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:50,679
Could you go back to your seat?

100
00:05:51,620 --> 00:05:54,678
Haohao, don't disturb others. Come back.

101
00:05:55,959 --> 00:05:58,139
- It's okay.
- Come over here.

102
00:05:58,139 --> 00:05:59,159
So cute.

103
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:00,238
Come over here and play.

104
00:06:00,239 --> 00:06:01,660
Indeed.

105
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:22,900
Kid, I can't write if you keep looking at me.

106
00:06:22,900 --> 00:06:25,540
Don't worry about him. He doesn't know many words.

107
00:06:26,220 --> 00:06:29,359
This is not a matter of how many words he knows.

108
00:06:29,359 --> 00:06:32,339
Then what's the problem that he is playing there?

109
00:06:33,359 --> 00:06:34,600
He...

110
00:06:38,959 --> 00:06:40,400
Sorry.

111
00:06:46,299 --> 00:06:47,940
Sorry.

112
00:06:49,519 --> 00:06:51,498
Haohao, let's go. Let's go play somewhere else.

113
00:06:51,498 --> 00:06:53,278
Come on. Go with mommy.

114
00:06:53,279 --> 00:06:55,120
Be careful.

115
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:56,260
Let's go.

116
00:06:57,220 --> 00:06:58,500
Let's go play somewhere else.

117
00:06:58,500 --> 00:06:59,940
Come on.

118
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:07,119
What did you tell them?

119
00:07:08,239 --> 00:07:11,199
I told her we were working on a project for adult products,

120
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:12,980
with pictures.

121
00:07:15,139 --> 00:07:16,739
You can't be smarter.

122
00:07:16,739 --> 00:07:18,419
You have to write on a rare day off.

123
00:07:18,419 --> 00:07:19,838
You can't be disturbed.

124
00:07:19,839 --> 00:07:21,099
You got this!

125
00:07:21,099 --> 00:07:22,459
I got this!

126
00:07:34,361 --> 00:07:37,640
I didn't expect Taoyuan Village to be quite a comfortable place.

127
00:07:37,640 --> 00:07:39,720
Most importantly, it's beautiful.

128
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:41,879
By the way, don't tell the director and Dr. Ye

129
00:07:41,880 --> 00:07:45,699
that I was chased by a dog into the ditch yesterday.

130
00:07:45,699 --> 00:07:47,719
I've already told them.

131
00:07:47,719 --> 00:07:49,820
What a loose tongue you have.

132
00:07:49,820 --> 00:07:51,958
My tongue is not as loose as your brake.

133
00:07:51,959 --> 00:07:54,100
At that time, I only saw a streak of white light flash,

134
00:07:54,100 --> 00:07:56,779
and then all of a sudden, a beautiful woman emerged from the water.

135
00:07:56,779 --> 00:07:59,798
I was wondering which fairy had come down to earth.

136
00:07:59,799 --> 00:08:01,539
Cut the crap.

137
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:05,500
But seriously, the next time you encounter a dog barking at you, you must not run.

138
00:08:05,519 --> 00:08:07,039
The faster you run, the more excited it will be.

139
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:09,900
I'm not afraid of a dog on a leash.

140
00:08:09,900 --> 00:08:11,859
Then you are awesome!

141
00:08:12,740 --> 00:08:14,879
Okay. Come again when you have time.

142
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:17,620
Next time you come over I'll take you to pick wild fruit.

143
00:08:17,620 --> 00:08:19,559
How long are you going to stay here?

144
00:08:19,559 --> 00:08:21,060
I don't know.

145
00:08:21,060 --> 00:08:22,600
I want to stay a while longer.

146
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:25,118
Sure. Keep in touch on WeChat.

147
00:08:25,119 --> 00:08:25,958
Bye.

148
00:08:25,959 --> 00:08:27,740
Bye-bye, fairy.

149
00:08:27,740 --> 00:08:29,120
Bye.

150
00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:35,798
Are these all for us to take away?

151
00:08:35,799 --> 00:08:38,140
Yeah.

152
00:08:38,140 --> 00:08:40,179
These groundnuts and potatoes don't go bad easily.

153
00:08:40,179 --> 00:08:42,059
You can eat them for a long time.

154
00:08:42,059 --> 00:08:44,199
These vegetables can not be kept for long.

155
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:45,678
You have to finish them in the next few days.

156
00:08:45,679 --> 00:08:47,618
You can share them after you go back.

157
00:08:47,618 --> 00:08:49,420
Director, these are way too many.

158
00:08:49,420 --> 00:08:51,658
It's fine. You have a car anyway.

159
00:08:51,658 --> 00:08:54,300
In this way, you don't need to buy them in the supermarket.

160
00:08:55,139 --> 00:08:57,500
This bottle of medicinal wine is poured from the newly-open jar.

161
00:08:57,500 --> 00:08:59,839
The two of you should order fewer deliveries.

162
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:02,320
Cook on your own more. You'll soon finish these.

163
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:04,660
Then what are these two boxes?

164
00:09:04,660 --> 00:09:07,638
One is a vase. The other one is a set of tableware.

165
00:09:07,638 --> 00:09:09,818
I asked Su to buy it for you online.

166
00:09:09,818 --> 00:09:12,319
They must be handled with care.

167
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:15,299
Yes. Handle with care. These are organic eggs.

168
00:09:15,299 --> 00:09:17,138
What do you buy these for?

169
00:09:17,138 --> 00:09:19,680
As a housewarming gift.

170
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:22,140
I haven't bought and moved to a new home.

171
00:09:22,140 --> 00:09:24,880
When you buy an apartment and move to a new home, we may not be able to go,

172
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:27,420
so we gave you the gift in advance.

173
00:09:28,300 --> 00:09:30,118
When I buy an apartment and move into the new home,

174
00:09:30,119 --> 00:09:31,399
you must come.

175
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:33,118
Otherwise, I'll return them to you.

176
00:09:33,119 --> 00:09:36,140
Okay. We promise we'll come.

177
00:09:36,140 --> 00:09:38,018
Okay, Su. Help carry all this to the car.

178
00:09:38,099 --> 00:09:39,599
- No problem.
- Let's go.

179
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:50,879
Now that I think about it, I've gained so much

180
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:52,939
in the past six months in Taoyuan Village.

181
00:09:52,939 --> 00:09:55,819
Director and Deputy Director had been so nice to me.

182
00:09:55,819 --> 00:09:59,218
I learned a lot here as a general practitioner.

183
00:09:59,218 --> 00:10:01,179
For example, acupuncture.

184
00:10:01,179 --> 00:10:04,799
And I also learned to raise chickens and goats.

185
00:10:04,799 --> 00:10:07,280
It was so interesting.

186
00:10:07,280 --> 00:10:10,699
I'm glad you can think in such a positive way about it.

187
00:10:10,699 --> 00:10:12,199
My boyfriend is optimistic.

188
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:13,659
How can I be pessimistic?

189
00:10:13,659 --> 00:10:18,118
But don't you think that I'm the most important thing you gained in Taoyuan Village?

190
00:10:18,118 --> 00:10:19,700
You're not a thing I gained.

191
00:10:19,700 --> 00:10:21,860
You're a gift of god.

192
00:10:22,780 --> 00:10:25,099
Are your lips covered with honey?

193
00:10:25,099 --> 00:10:27,358
I should give the credit to my honey-lipped boyfriend.

194
00:10:27,359 --> 00:10:28,819
I need to improve myself.

195
00:10:28,819 --> 00:10:31,899
You've not only improved. You've gone beyond.

196
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:33,819
Okay.

197
00:10:33,819 --> 00:10:35,238
I'll try to tone it down.

198
00:10:35,239 --> 00:10:36,640
No need to do that.

199
00:10:37,359 --> 00:10:39,139
Just keep it this way.

200
00:10:46,359 --> 00:10:48,859
I'm telling you that it must be true.

201
00:10:48,859 --> 00:10:51,841
- I feel like it's really possible after hearing what you said.
- I told you.

202
00:10:51,841 --> 00:10:54,038
Yeah. The two of them knew each other before.

203
00:10:54,039 --> 00:10:56,739
And then President particularly asked Dr. Ye to be his assistant.

204
00:10:56,739 --> 00:10:59,038
And the two of them have spent so much time together.

205
00:10:59,039 --> 00:11:01,598
And I have deliberately observed their eye contact.

206
00:11:01,599 --> 00:11:03,800
There must be something between them.

207
00:11:04,900 --> 00:11:07,590
Dr. Zeng, you came together with them.

208
00:11:07,590 --> 00:11:09,450
Did you find anything going on with them?

209
00:11:09,458 --> 00:11:12,138
I woke up too early, so I slept the whole way.

210
00:11:12,138 --> 00:11:13,420
Stop lying.

211
00:11:13,420 --> 00:11:15,580
Then, why didn't you go back with them?

212
00:11:15,580 --> 00:11:19,499
They decided to leave later and I wanted to go home earlier.

213
00:11:20,919 --> 00:11:22,358
They're definitely dating.

214
00:11:22,359 --> 00:11:23,918
Look how they look at each other.

215
00:11:23,919 --> 00:11:25,699
Definitely.

216
00:11:33,320 --> 00:11:35,340
Excuse me. Please enjoy your meal.

217
00:11:35,340 --> 00:11:37,180
How long do you think it will take

218
00:11:37,180 --> 00:11:39,479
for the two of them to be discovered in their secret relationship?

219
00:11:40,119 --> 00:11:44,080
As the old saying goes, love turns people into fools.

220
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:46,659
Both of them can't help but look at each other all day long.

221
00:11:46,659 --> 00:11:49,139
Do they believe everyone around them is also stupid?

222
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:53,959
But given the difference between their identities,

223
00:11:53,959 --> 00:11:58,180
if the news is known to others, it might do harm to Ye.

224
00:11:58,180 --> 00:11:59,880
I agree.

225
00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:01,859
But Dr. Ye is going back to the Department of Pediatrics soon.

226
00:12:01,859 --> 00:12:03,540
It should be fine.

227
00:12:05,959 --> 00:12:07,860
Don't eat too fast. It's bad for your stomach.

228
00:12:07,860 --> 00:12:09,380
Eat slowly.

229
00:12:10,420 --> 00:12:12,799
Am I being too verbose?

230
00:12:12,799 --> 00:12:14,179
Not at all.

231
00:12:14,179 --> 00:12:15,739
I know it's not good either.

232
00:12:15,739 --> 00:12:17,679
I just often forget.

233
00:12:17,679 --> 00:12:19,859
Changing habits is indeed quite difficult.

234
00:12:19,859 --> 00:12:22,839
So I would love to have someone who can always supervise and remind me.

235
00:12:22,839 --> 00:12:25,379
Then we'll have to eat together more often.

236
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:37,179
By the way, why do you like to read novels in cafes?

237
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:40,979
I like to have a bit of white noise.

238
00:12:40,979 --> 00:12:42,959
It's too quiet at home alone.

239
00:12:42,959 --> 00:12:45,379
Sometimes it makes me feel lonely.

240
00:12:46,119 --> 00:12:48,939
I also wrote full-time at home for a while before.

241
00:12:48,939 --> 00:12:50,439
I was disheveled every day.

242
00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:52,699
My work schedule used to be particularly irregular and I was really stressed,

243
00:12:52,699 --> 00:12:54,519
so I came out to find a job

244
00:12:54,520 --> 00:12:57,940
to force myself to return to a healthy lifestyle.

245
00:12:57,940 --> 00:13:00,659
You need to update every day but you still have so many manuscripts in stock.

246
00:13:00,659 --> 00:13:02,640
You're so persistent.

247
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:05,899
The most important thing is that the work at the cafe is on schedule,

248
00:13:05,899 --> 00:13:07,598
so I can construct the story in my mind while I'm working,

249
00:13:07,599 --> 00:13:09,980
and then write it out at night when I get home.

250
00:13:09,980 --> 00:13:11,200
That's awesome too!

251
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:12,959
For most people, when they get home after working a full day,

252
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:15,159
they just want to lie down and browse on their phones.

253
00:13:15,840 --> 00:13:19,080
You've made me a littleimpressed with myself.

254
00:13:20,080 --> 00:13:22,800
Do you have any novels whose filming rights were sold?

255
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:25,980
Previously, I talked to a film company about one of my novels.

256
00:13:25,980 --> 00:13:28,140
We discussed back and forth for half a year.

257
00:13:28,140 --> 00:13:29,699
Right when they decided to buy it,

258
00:13:29,699 --> 00:13:33,040
the film industry recession started, so the company closed down.

259
00:13:34,780 --> 00:13:36,539
I recommend that you find an agent

260
00:13:36,539 --> 00:13:39,119
so that he can send your novels to some film companies proactively.

261
00:13:40,119 --> 00:13:42,258
No agent wants to work with a nobody like me.

262
00:13:42,258 --> 00:13:45,200
Then my contract will be the red card of my career.

263
00:13:46,379 --> 00:13:50,060
If you don't mind, I can try to be your part-time agent.

264
00:13:50,060 --> 00:13:51,180
You must be joking.

265
00:13:51,180 --> 00:13:52,639
I'm not.

266
00:13:52,639 --> 00:13:55,998
I know some friends in this industry, and I am familiar with your work.

267
00:13:55,998 --> 00:13:58,000
It shouldn't take too long.

268
00:13:59,479 --> 00:14:03,038
But, of course, I'm just proposing. It's okay if you refuse.

269
00:14:03,038 --> 00:14:05,579
I would love to!

270
00:14:05,579 --> 00:14:07,399
Then, if someone comes to me to talk about cooperation,

271
00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:11,319
I can directly tell him "You can contact my agent."

272
00:14:11,320 --> 00:14:14,059
It sounds fantastic!

273
00:14:14,059 --> 00:14:15,600
Then that's the deal.

274
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:17,199
I'll regard it as doing something for my idol.

275
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:20,019
Well, if I can't make any progress,you can't cancel me.

276
00:14:20,019 --> 00:14:23,320
Relax. I've been liking you for a long time.

277
00:14:26,960 --> 00:14:30,038
- I mean...
- Okay, okay. I get it.

278
00:14:30,038 --> 00:14:32,379
I hope you will always like me.

279
00:14:32,379 --> 00:14:35,280
Come on. Let's take this lemonade as wine. Toast to our cooperation!

280
00:14:35,280 --> 00:14:37,000
Toast to our cooperation!

281
00:14:40,660 --> 00:14:42,260
My agent.

282
00:14:42,260 --> 00:14:45,460
<i>[Outpatient]</i>

283
00:14:58,100 --> 00:14:59,138
Stop looking for it.

284
00:14:59,138 --> 00:15:02,140
There is no picture of you and Dr. Ye in the same frame.

285
00:15:02,140 --> 00:15:04,059
Who chose the pictures?

286
00:15:04,059 --> 00:15:06,179
I remember the photographer had taken some that day.

287
00:15:06,179 --> 00:15:07,440
I chose them.

288
00:15:08,819 --> 00:15:10,099
You did it on purpose.

289
00:15:10,099 --> 00:15:12,000
Don't you want to keep it a secret?

290
00:15:14,579 --> 00:15:16,440
That's very sweet of you.

291
00:15:17,139 --> 00:15:19,380
Although you didn't have physical contact,

292
00:15:19,380 --> 00:15:21,580
but the way you looked at each other was suspicious.

293
00:15:21,580 --> 00:15:23,699
That's because you know it.

294
00:15:23,699 --> 00:15:25,619
Do not rule out the possibility.

295
00:15:27,039 --> 00:15:29,559
Never mind. Send it to me in private afterward.

296
00:15:29,559 --> 00:15:30,839
Okay.

297
00:15:33,980 --> 00:15:36,018
Is there anything new from President Gao?

298
00:15:36,018 --> 00:15:37,659
The audit team hasn't left yet.

299
00:15:37,659 --> 00:15:39,058
He's also a bit anxious.

300
00:15:39,058 --> 00:15:40,079
That's good.

301
00:15:40,079 --> 00:15:42,439
It means that although he handled it very stealthily,

302
00:15:42,439 --> 00:15:44,079
but he is still worried that it would be discovered,

303
00:15:44,079 --> 00:15:46,900
so he will definitely do something.

304
00:15:53,540 --> 00:15:54,798
Have you been waiting long?

305
00:15:54,799 --> 00:15:56,720
Not really.

306
00:15:56,720 --> 00:15:58,139
Thank you.

307
00:16:04,559 --> 00:16:06,319
How about it?

308
00:16:06,319 --> 00:16:07,339
How about what?

309
00:16:07,339 --> 00:16:08,959
The coffee.

310
00:16:12,799 --> 00:16:14,478
Why is there no brand on it?

311
00:16:14,479 --> 00:16:16,259
Which cafe is this?

312
00:16:17,540 --> 00:16:19,120
What about the taste?

313
00:16:19,719 --> 00:16:21,560
It tastes the same as the previous ones.

314
00:16:22,139 --> 00:16:24,619
This is the takeaway cup I bought myself.

315
00:16:24,619 --> 00:16:26,959
I asked Jiajia what coffee beans they use in the cafe,

316
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:28,580
and the ratio of milk.

317
00:16:28,580 --> 00:16:31,519
I made this myself in the pantry.

318
00:16:31,519 --> 00:16:34,499
The cost is much cheaper this way.

319
00:16:35,579 --> 00:16:38,439
If everyone were like you, then the cafes and the flower shops

320
00:16:38,440 --> 00:16:40,220
would have to go out of business.

321
00:16:40,220 --> 00:16:42,240
Shouldn't you be complimenting me?

322
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:44,780
Yes. You're provident and thrifty.

323
00:16:44,780 --> 00:16:46,798
If someone is lucky enough to marry you,

324
00:16:46,799 --> 00:16:48,860
then you will be his biggest fortune.

325
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:53,479
You don't care about this small amount of money.

326
00:16:53,479 --> 00:16:54,900
I do care.

327
00:16:56,420 --> 00:16:59,419
Then tell me. What day is it today?

328
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,160
What is today?

329
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:04,479
Payday!

330
00:17:04,479 --> 00:17:07,638
None of us will forget it. But clearly you will.

331
00:17:07,638 --> 00:17:09,320
Why should I remember this?

332
00:17:09,320 --> 00:17:11,020
It's enough that the Financial Department remembers it.

333
00:17:11,020 --> 00:17:13,698
You will naturally know it when you receive the SMS notification.

334
00:17:13,698 --> 00:17:15,639
You don't get it.

335
00:17:16,239 --> 00:17:21,459
I have to pay my credit cards, pay my monthly rent, and utilities.

336
00:17:21,460 --> 00:17:24,019
And I also need to think about how to treat myself.

337
00:17:24,019 --> 00:17:26,719
I look forward to this day every month.

338
00:17:27,339 --> 00:17:29,980
So have you decided how to treat yourself?

339
00:17:32,339 --> 00:17:34,339
How about go shopping with me tonight?

340
00:17:34,339 --> 00:17:36,159
I'll buy us dinner.

341
00:17:36,940 --> 00:17:38,339
Okay.

342
00:17:41,780 --> 00:17:44,439
You're going back to the Department of Pediatrics soon.

343
00:17:44,439 --> 00:17:46,519
Can we still meet here privately?

344
00:17:47,820 --> 00:17:49,340
What do you think?

345
00:17:49,340 --> 00:17:51,040
I don't know.

346
00:17:51,040 --> 00:17:53,300
But for me, I would love to meet.

347
00:17:53,300 --> 00:17:56,079
But everything is up to you, my boss.

348
00:17:56,079 --> 00:17:57,980
Am I your boss?

349
00:17:57,980 --> 00:18:00,838
We are a love task force. You're the leader.

350
00:18:02,739 --> 00:18:07,139
Then I think we'll see what happens.

351
00:18:07,139 --> 00:18:09,699
Then we'll do it secretly.

352
00:18:09,699 --> 00:18:10,679
Okay.

353
00:18:10,679 --> 00:18:12,700
I'll listen to your arrangement.

354
00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:16,120
How about the view over there?

355
00:18:16,120 --> 00:18:17,939
It should be a good spot for the shooting.

356
00:18:20,700 --> 00:18:22,239
President.

357
00:18:23,379 --> 00:18:25,020
What a coincidence.

358
00:18:25,020 --> 00:18:27,800
Yeah. Dr. Zeng said the view is nice here.

359
00:18:27,800 --> 00:18:30,800
So we wanted to check out if this was a suitable place for shooting.

360
00:18:32,580 --> 00:18:34,598
Dr. Ye will be back in the Department of Pediatrics soon.

361
00:18:34,599 --> 00:18:36,839
So she bought me a cup of coffee.

362
00:18:36,839 --> 00:18:39,719
Yeah. And today happened to be payday.

363
00:18:39,719 --> 00:18:41,338
You're finally coming back to the Department of Pediatrics.

364
00:18:41,338 --> 00:18:45,259
Our department was just discussing when to get together to host a dinner for your return.

365
00:18:45,259 --> 00:18:48,439
Great. Dinner is on me.

366
00:18:48,439 --> 00:18:49,919
How can we make you pay?

367
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:51,600
Let me do it.

368
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:54,219
I took up so much of your time after all.

369
00:18:54,219 --> 00:18:56,959
But I won't join you so that you can be more relaxed.

370
00:18:57,660 --> 00:19:00,078
Dr. Zeng, isn't President Lu a good boss

371
00:19:00,079 --> 00:19:02,099
who understands the minds of his employees?

372
00:19:02,099 --> 00:19:04,519
Definitely.

373
00:19:04,519 --> 00:19:07,839
Now I understand that a good boss should not engage in

374
00:19:07,839 --> 00:19:09,520
the private life of his employees.

375
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:11,600
Out of sight, out of mind.

376
00:19:22,300 --> 00:19:24,320
Is your hand okay?

377
00:19:30,199 --> 00:19:31,438
Of course not.

378
00:19:31,439 --> 00:19:33,219
I can't even hold this glass of water.

379
00:19:33,219 --> 00:19:34,980
Let me see.

380
00:19:41,079 --> 00:19:43,039
Where are you injured?

381
00:19:43,039 --> 00:19:44,440
It still hurts?

382
00:19:44,440 --> 00:19:47,039
You just shook off my hand so hard and firmly.

383
00:19:47,039 --> 00:19:48,700
How can it not hurt?

384
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:51,360
I'm sorry.

385
00:19:52,700 --> 00:19:54,139
I need comfort.

386
00:19:59,499 --> 00:20:01,180
Feeling better?

387
00:20:01,719 --> 00:20:03,119
Still hurts.

388
00:20:05,880 --> 00:20:07,480
Is it all right now?

389
00:20:08,339 --> 00:20:10,880
Yeah. Recovered.

390
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:13,000
Drama queen.

391
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:14,780
Focus on your work.

392
00:20:24,319 --> 00:20:26,080
Dr. Ye. Dr. Zeng.

393
00:20:30,059 --> 00:20:32,759
Dr. Jiang, still working?

394
00:20:32,759 --> 00:20:33,820
Zhining is still in surgery.

395
00:20:33,820 --> 00:20:36,180
I'll wait until she's finished and get off work with her.

396
00:20:37,199 --> 00:20:38,820
I'm jealous.

397
00:20:41,021 --> 00:20:43,640
Dr. Zeng, you haven't mentioned a boyfriend lately?

398
00:20:44,280 --> 00:20:45,859
We are not suitable for each other.

399
00:20:45,859 --> 00:20:48,419
Relax. I haven't thought about that at all.

400
00:20:48,419 --> 00:20:51,339
I just feel that our department has been favored by Cupid recently.

401
00:20:51,339 --> 00:20:52,699
It should be our turn soon.

402
00:20:52,699 --> 00:20:54,859
You try harder. I'm not as anxious as you.

403
00:20:54,859 --> 00:20:56,958
I would say it's not really about trying.

404
00:20:56,959 --> 00:20:58,739
It's about fate.

405
00:20:58,739 --> 00:21:03,118
For example, the love between Dr. Ye and the president is the result of fate.

406
00:21:08,920 --> 00:21:12,200
Don't you know that Dr. Ye and the president are dating?

407
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:13,379
Says who?

408
00:21:13,379 --> 00:21:14,839
Colleagues in the Inpatient Department.

409
00:21:14,839 --> 00:21:16,460
It might just be rumors.

410
00:21:16,460 --> 00:21:18,400
I think it's possible.

411
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:22,259
They said Dr. Ye ran into our president at the clinic

412
00:21:22,259 --> 00:21:24,780
when she was providing free clinical treatment in Taoyuan Village.

413
00:21:24,780 --> 00:21:27,739
Our president fell in love with her at first sight.

414
00:21:27,739 --> 00:21:31,079
Then he immediately donated an ultrasound machine.

415
00:21:31,079 --> 00:21:32,580
And you all knew what happened later.

416
00:21:32,580 --> 00:21:36,160
After the president came back and took office, she was immediately restored to her original post.

417
00:21:36,160 --> 00:21:38,300
What's more, he even made her his assistant.

418
00:21:38,300 --> 00:21:40,159
The reason they went to Taoyuan Village to provide free clinical treatment this time

419
00:21:40,159 --> 00:21:42,619
was that the president wanted to revisit the place they met.

420
00:21:42,619 --> 00:21:45,459
Our fellow colleagues said they get along naturally in private

421
00:21:45,459 --> 00:21:49,239
which is not like the relationship between a superior and a subordinate at all.

422
00:21:49,820 --> 00:21:54,319
As far as I'm concerned, in addition to him making her his assistant, the rest is all rumors.

423
00:21:54,319 --> 00:21:56,759
But there were colleagues who saw them commuting together.

424
00:21:56,760 --> 00:22:00,380
It's normal for the assistant to drive for the president.

425
00:22:01,880 --> 00:22:04,459
Why do you think it's normal?

426
00:22:04,459 --> 00:22:06,718
I just told other colleagues today that your sixth sense was particularly accurate.

427
00:22:06,718 --> 00:22:08,800
You found out two months ago that the relationship between them was suspicious.

428
00:22:08,800 --> 00:22:11,810
Can you really give me a sense of presence?

429
00:22:11,810 --> 00:22:13,630
I didn't like Dr. Ye at the time,

430
00:22:13,630 --> 00:22:15,930
so I spoke without thinking it through.

431
00:22:22,259 --> 00:22:24,260
I think you two are so weird.

432
00:22:24,260 --> 00:22:27,560
I feel that you do not want them to be together.

433
00:22:27,560 --> 00:22:31,818
I think they are quite a good match. Isn't it a good thing to congratulate?

434
00:22:31,818 --> 00:22:34,538
Even if the president and Dr. Ye are truly in a relationship,

435
00:22:34,538 --> 00:22:36,978
since the two of them didn't tell everyone, it means that they have concerns,

436
00:22:36,978 --> 00:22:39,459
so let's stop making trouble for them.

437
00:22:40,739 --> 00:22:42,159
I didn't say that.

438
00:22:42,160 --> 00:22:44,640
Okay, okay. Let's not talk about this. Time to get off duty! Go home!

439
00:22:52,399 --> 00:22:54,460
Do you want me to drive?

440
00:22:54,460 --> 00:22:55,999
I'm good.

441
00:22:55,999 --> 00:22:58,539
We can't use this excuse many times.

442
00:22:58,539 --> 00:23:02,518
When I get back to the Department of Pediatrics we'll have to split up.

443
00:23:04,019 --> 00:23:05,940
How about I buy you a car?

444
00:23:05,940 --> 00:23:09,239
This will make it easier for you to commute. What do you think?

445
00:23:09,239 --> 00:23:11,199
- Can you lend me money?
- I can.

446
00:23:11,199 --> 00:23:13,879
- Do I need to pay it back?
- Up to you.

447
00:23:14,780 --> 00:23:17,219
If I don't have to pay back, I definitely won't borrow.

448
00:23:17,219 --> 00:23:20,198
But if I need to pay the money back, it's beyond my capacity.

449
00:23:20,198 --> 00:23:22,999
I still have to save up to buy a house.

450
00:23:22,999 --> 00:23:25,039
Then how about I lend you money to buy an apartment,

451
00:23:25,040 --> 00:23:27,240
so that you can pay me back slowly.

452
00:23:27,240 --> 00:23:29,759
Why do you want to be my debtor so badly?

453
00:23:29,759 --> 00:23:33,459
You must let your boyfriend play his role.

454
00:23:33,459 --> 00:23:35,039
You did play your role.

455
00:23:35,039 --> 00:23:37,660
They've scheduled my shift.

456
00:23:38,739 --> 00:23:41,778
That's the role of President Lu who's merely fulfilling his promise.

457
00:23:41,778 --> 00:23:44,720
I have no sense of accomplishment as your boyfriend.

458
00:23:46,359 --> 00:23:49,099
Didn't you say you want to supervise my exercise?

459
00:23:49,099 --> 00:23:52,100
This is your accomplishment as a boyfriend.

460
00:23:52,619 --> 00:23:54,080
Okay.

461
00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:57,159
So when do you want to start?

462
00:23:57,159 --> 00:24:01,040
No rush. I need to get an outfit first.

463
00:24:06,339 --> 00:24:08,000
How's that?

464
00:24:12,719 --> 00:24:15,839
Good. Super cool.

465
00:24:15,839 --> 00:24:18,339
Excuse me. Is there the same style for men?

466
00:24:18,339 --> 00:24:19,859
I want to get one for my boyfriend as well.

467
00:24:19,859 --> 00:24:21,620
Sure. Just a second.

468
00:24:21,620 --> 00:24:22,900
Do I also need to wear this?

469
00:24:22,900 --> 00:24:26,600
I'll buy it for you. Last time, you bought me a dress.

470
00:24:26,600 --> 00:24:28,700
It's a gift for you in return.

471
00:24:28,700 --> 00:24:30,359
Do you need to make it that clear?

472
00:24:30,359 --> 00:24:32,459
No, I'm not.

473
00:24:32,459 --> 00:24:35,759
You're rich. You can take a little loss.

474
00:24:35,759 --> 00:24:39,079
No line. That made me dare not give you a present.

475
00:24:39,079 --> 00:24:42,678
But please go easy on me. Don't make me go broke.

476
00:24:44,940 --> 00:24:48,239
Do you think I should get a gym card?

477
00:24:48,239 --> 00:24:51,140
Why didn't you stick with it before?

478
00:24:51,140 --> 00:24:54,079
I just found it boring, so I was always lazy.

479
00:24:54,079 --> 00:24:56,999
Then I don't really recommend that you get a gym card.

480
00:24:56,999 --> 00:24:59,380
Do you have any favorite sports?

481
00:24:59,380 --> 00:25:00,800
Not really.

482
00:25:00,800 --> 00:25:02,019
Then what sports do you know?

483
00:25:02,019 --> 00:25:05,599
I know how to play badminton. But I haven't played it for ages.

484
00:25:05,599 --> 00:25:08,159
Then I suggest you start by playing badminton.

485
00:25:08,160 --> 00:25:10,919
As long as you are interested in sports, it is easier for you to stick with it.

486
00:25:10,919 --> 00:25:12,999
After that, we'll find some other sports to play.

487
00:25:12,999 --> 00:25:15,380
Sure. You decide.

488
00:25:18,859 --> 00:25:20,490
Excuse me.

489
00:25:20,490 --> 00:25:22,080
<i>[Assistant Lin]</i>

490
00:25:22,460 --> 00:25:23,980
Hello. What's wrong?

491
00:25:23,980 --> 00:25:28,078
<i>I heard there are rumors in the hospital which said you and Dr. Ye may be dating.</i>

492
00:25:29,219 --> 00:25:31,000
How did they know?

493
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:33,579
<i>It seems to be because of what happened in Taoyuan Village.</i>

494
00:25:33,579 --> 00:25:35,579
<i>They associated it with you two.</i>

495
00:25:35,579 --> 00:25:37,459
Okay. I got it.

496
00:25:38,800 --> 00:25:40,620
What's going on?

497
00:25:40,620 --> 00:25:44,298
Nothing. Some minor problem. Let's go.

498
00:25:47,460 --> 00:25:50,339
Aren't you afraid to meet your colleagues here?

499
00:25:51,060 --> 00:25:54,299
I just feel like it's better to save trouble.

500
00:25:54,299 --> 00:25:57,978
But we can't help it if they found out about our relationship.

501
00:25:58,420 --> 00:26:01,359
I thought you were keen on keeping me as your secret lover.

502
00:26:01,359 --> 00:26:05,200
I only have a rental apartment. What type of secret lover are you?

503
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:09,439
I am... a devilish lover.

504
00:26:09,439 --> 00:26:11,980
Your joke is lame.

505
00:26:12,840 --> 00:26:14,619
What would you like to eat tonight?

506
00:26:14,619 --> 00:26:17,878
I eat whatever you treat me. I'm not fussy.

507
00:26:17,878 --> 00:26:19,279
Trying to save money for me?

508
00:26:19,279 --> 00:26:23,079
Yes, I am. I'm afraid you might think it costs a fortune to love me.

509
00:26:23,079 --> 00:26:27,699
It certainly does cost a lot of money and time.

510
00:26:27,699 --> 00:26:31,599
However, it's worth it for all the good things.

511
00:26:32,699 --> 00:26:34,979
Then I have to ask you seriously.

512
00:26:34,979 --> 00:26:37,420
Between a house and me, which is more important?

513
00:26:37,420 --> 00:26:39,720
What kind of boring questions are you asking?

514
00:26:39,720 --> 00:26:41,900
Is it hard to answer?

515
00:26:44,259 --> 00:26:45,580
How large is the house?

516
00:26:45,580 --> 00:26:48,639
When have you become so cunning!

517
00:26:53,540 --> 00:26:57,059
I don't know if this rumor has anything to do with President Gao.

518
00:26:59,259 --> 00:27:00,979
<i>It certainly has.</i>

519
00:27:00,979 --> 00:27:04,879
But the president didn't say anything. Should I remind him?

520
00:27:04,879 --> 00:27:07,059
<i>That's not necessary.</i>

521
00:27:08,859 --> 00:27:13,079
<i>I have my own arrangement... for this matter.</i>

522
00:27:13,079 --> 00:27:15,180
Okay, then I'll leave it.

523
00:27:15,180 --> 00:27:17,680
I will report to you when there is new information.

524
00:27:17,680 --> 00:27:19,080
<i>Okay.</i>

525
00:27:36,139 --> 00:27:37,559
What are you writing about?

526
00:27:37,559 --> 00:27:40,000
Some things about the work handover.

527
00:27:41,339 --> 00:27:44,179
- I'm returning to the Department of Pediatrics.
- Are you happy?

528
00:27:44,179 --> 00:27:46,160
Of course!

529
00:27:46,660 --> 00:27:52,039
But after you go back, you can't see Lu Zhaoxi all day long anymore.

530
00:27:52,039 --> 00:27:56,320
It's quite enough. If we always stay together, we will get tired of it.

531
00:27:56,320 --> 00:27:58,938
Then who is the one that works during the day and continues to date after night falls?

532
00:27:58,938 --> 00:28:00,360
I can barely see you.

533
00:28:00,360 --> 00:28:03,319
Exaggerated. I'm still sitting here right now.

534
00:28:03,319 --> 00:28:06,839
What? Do you want to sleep over now?

535
00:28:06,839 --> 00:28:10,379
We don't necessarily need to sleep over.

536
00:28:11,900 --> 00:28:15,960
That sounds x-rated.

537
00:28:15,960 --> 00:28:19,220
Recently, I saw Assistant Lin always liked your post in WeChat Moments.

538
00:28:19,220 --> 00:28:21,139
What's going on with you two?

539
00:28:21,139 --> 00:28:25,019
There are sparks. But we still need more time.

540
00:28:25,999 --> 00:28:29,878
But I really did not expect he would like this kind of novel,

541
00:28:29,878 --> 00:28:32,419
and is a regular reader of yours.

542
00:28:32,419 --> 00:28:36,779
I'm also glad that I have such a high-quality reader.

543
00:28:36,779 --> 00:28:38,759
How about helping me make Lu Zhaoxi my reader as well?

544
00:28:38,759 --> 00:28:42,319
No. I am afraid he will pick up something bad.

545
00:28:42,319 --> 00:28:45,719
Do my novels teach people to behave badly?

546
00:28:45,719 --> 00:28:47,770
That's not what I meant.

547
00:28:47,770 --> 00:28:48,920
I got it.

548
00:28:48,920 --> 00:28:52,790
You're afraid that he'll use naughty tricks on you.

549
00:28:53,439 --> 00:28:54,979
You jerk.

Time to change the water?

583
00:31:30,719 --> 00:31:33,659
- Morning.
- Morning.

584
00:31:33,659 --> 00:31:36,619
Today is my last day as your assistant.

585
00:31:36,619 --> 00:31:39,459
It's time to change the water.

586
00:31:40,580 --> 00:31:42,520
Let me help you.

587
00:31:53,859 --> 00:31:56,310
Add water to one-third of the vase.

588
00:31:56,310 --> 00:31:57,880
Okay.

589
00:32:02,219 --> 00:32:04,180
Have a look.

590
00:32:04,180 --> 00:32:05,599
This is the nutrient solution.

591
00:32:05,599 --> 00:32:09,418
After you add the water, put in a certain ratio into the vase.

592
00:32:09,418 --> 00:32:11,079
Have a try.

593
00:32:14,360 --> 00:32:16,399
Okay. Enough.

594
00:32:16,399 --> 00:32:18,160
That's it.

595
00:32:19,119 --> 00:32:24,219
This is Pieris. You need to cut the roots and change the water once a week.

596
00:32:24,219 --> 00:32:28,500
If you take good care of it, it can live about two months.

597
00:32:28,500 --> 00:32:31,999
It indeed resembles you. So vital and resilient.

598
00:32:31,999 --> 00:32:34,810
Now you know why I bought Pieris.

599
00:32:34,810 --> 00:32:36,920
Now I know that from now on,

600
00:32:36,920 --> 00:32:40,750
you want me to see only its leaves, not other flowers.

601
00:32:40,759 --> 00:32:44,580
Nonsense! I'm not that bossy.

602
00:32:44,580 --> 00:32:48,080
I was thinking that since I'm no longer your assistant,

603
00:32:48,080 --> 00:32:50,620
it can accompany you for me.

604
00:32:51,700 --> 00:32:54,099
Understood. So that it can watch over me.

605
00:32:54,099 --> 00:32:56,860
Do you have paranoia of being controlled?

606
00:32:58,000 --> 00:32:59,619
Do you know how to do it?

607
00:32:59,619 --> 00:33:01,159
Yes, I do.

608
00:33:01,159 --> 00:33:05,460
You should come to see it more often.

609
00:33:12,060 --> 00:33:13,361
<i>[Anxing Hospital]</i>

610
00:33:13,361 --> 00:33:16,179
Our doctors take the initiative to go to the village to offer medical assistance.

611
00:33:16,179 --> 00:33:18,138
The working conditions there are tough and the work is complicated.

612
00:33:18,138 --> 00:33:20,539
However, because it does not directly bring benefits to the hospital,

613
00:33:20,539 --> 00:33:23,379
if we use the same set of performance systems to evaluate their workload,

614
00:33:23,379 --> 00:33:25,939
the doctor's salary will be too low.

615
00:33:25,939 --> 00:33:27,299
This is very unreasonable.

616
00:33:27,299 --> 00:33:29,320
The hospital's decision to set up this public welfare program

617
00:33:29,320 --> 00:33:32,998
not only contributes to society but also promotes the brand image of our hospital.

618
00:33:32,998 --> 00:33:36,358
So I don't think our doctors should be the ones to pay for it.

619
00:33:36,358 --> 00:33:39,760
You're right. I totally agree with what President said.

620
00:33:39,760 --> 00:33:42,480
We ignored this matter before.

621
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:45,799
However, it happens that a new group of medical assistance is recruiting volunteers now.

622
00:33:45,799 --> 00:33:49,440
Let's start adjusting from this time.

623
00:33:50,019 --> 00:33:51,459
I agree.

624
00:33:51,459 --> 00:33:53,599
Okay. I'll follow up on this.

625
00:33:53,599 --> 00:33:54,839
Anything else?

626
00:33:54,839 --> 00:33:56,359
No, President.

627
00:33:56,359 --> 00:33:58,980
Okay. The meeting is over.

628
00:34:08,819 --> 00:34:14,320
Dean Xu, I've just got some good tea.

629
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:16,838
Come on. Come and have a try.

630
00:34:16,838 --> 00:34:18,439
Let's go.

631
00:34:20,260 --> 00:34:24,240
Here. Have a try.

632
00:34:27,059 --> 00:34:28,839
Here.

633
00:34:36,479 --> 00:34:40,559
You've come to see me for something today, right?

634
00:34:42,460 --> 00:34:44,399
Associate Dean Xu,

635
00:34:44,399 --> 00:34:49,699
we've been colleagues and employees at Anxing Hospital for ages. Right?

636
00:34:49,699 --> 00:34:52,980
We've known each other well, haven't we?

637
00:34:52,980 --> 00:34:58,039
If you think what I'm about to tell you today is wrong or offensive,

638
00:34:58,039 --> 00:35:01,138
you can just forget about it after you walk out the door. Okay?

639
00:35:01,138 --> 00:35:04,239
Sure. I'm all ears.

640
00:35:05,460 --> 00:35:09,700
You've heard the rumors about President Lu, right?

641
00:35:09,700 --> 00:35:11,379
What rumors?

642
00:35:11,379 --> 00:35:14,940
President Lu is dating Dr. Ye.

643
00:35:16,399 --> 00:35:18,799
Is this a rumor or a fact?

644
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:21,320
It's absolutely true.

645
00:35:21,940 --> 00:35:24,020
It's just a private matter for them.

646
00:35:24,020 --> 00:35:26,599
Why are you telling me this?

647
00:35:26,599 --> 00:35:31,720
No matter if it is a private matter or official business, thereby hangs a tale.

648
00:35:31,720 --> 00:35:34,639
You may not know Chairman Lu as well as I do.

649
00:35:34,639 --> 00:35:40,020
Chairman Lu hates people who have an improper private life.

650
00:35:40,020 --> 00:35:45,558
Even if it is his own son, he will not stand up for him publicly.

651
00:35:48,439 --> 00:35:52,439
Deputy President Xu, you deserve...

652
00:35:53,980 --> 00:35:59,599
the position of President of the Hospital by rights.

653
00:36:02,180 --> 00:36:04,539
Nothing is deserved.

654
00:36:04,539 --> 00:36:05,880
Right.

655
00:36:05,880 --> 00:36:08,339
President Lu is also doing a good job.

656
00:36:08,339 --> 00:36:10,819
In the beginning,

657
00:36:10,819 --> 00:36:13,759
did you think that he would leave after a year and a half as I did?

658
00:36:13,759 --> 00:36:16,060
But look at the situation now.

659
00:36:16,060 --> 00:36:19,338
He may continue to be the president for another three or five years.

660
00:36:19,940 --> 00:36:21,579
So?

661
00:36:22,299 --> 00:36:24,599
So...

662
00:36:25,919 --> 00:36:31,220
So I want to give you a hand, making him leave earlier.

663
00:36:33,880 --> 00:36:36,800
Why do you want to help me?

664
00:36:37,800 --> 00:36:41,960
Because I also need your help.

665
00:36:53,299 --> 00:36:55,420
Dr. Ye, you went to get the delivery?

666
00:36:55,420 --> 00:36:57,220
They're for the president.

667
00:36:57,220 --> 00:37:00,320
I've brought you the office supplies you applied for.

668
00:37:00,320 --> 00:37:03,160
You don't have to. I can do it myself.

669
00:37:03,160 --> 00:37:04,920
No big deal.

670
00:37:04,920 --> 00:37:07,398
Assistant Wu is coming to work next week.

671
00:37:07,398 --> 00:37:09,160
I'm making up the office supplies for her.

672
00:37:09,160 --> 00:37:10,398
You're so sweet.

673
00:37:10,399 --> 00:37:11,858
Please check the supplies later.

674
00:37:11,858 --> 00:37:13,760
Call me directly if you have any problems.

675
00:37:13,760 --> 00:37:15,800
Well, thank you so much for that.

676
00:37:15,800 --> 00:37:18,239
I've cleaned up your desk in the Department of Pediatrics, too.

677
00:37:18,239 --> 00:37:21,280
Feel free to contact me if you have any questions.

678
00:37:21,980 --> 00:37:23,359
Thanks a million for your help.

679
00:37:23,360 --> 00:37:24,339
Okay. I might need to go now.

680
00:37:24,339 --> 00:37:27,439
- Sure. See you around.
- See you.

681
00:37:37,740 --> 00:37:40,038
President, should I unbox the deliveries outside?

682
00:37:40,038 --> 00:37:42,139
No. Those are Qiao Yu's.

683
00:37:42,139 --> 00:37:44,719
She's always in the hospital these days. So she sent them here first.

684
00:37:44,719 --> 00:37:47,138
Okay, I'll tell her to pick them up later.

685
00:37:47,138 --> 00:37:48,139
Okay.

686
00:37:48,139 --> 00:37:50,539
President, do you have time now?

687
00:37:50,539 --> 00:37:52,940
Yes. Why?

688
00:37:54,420 --> 00:37:57,659
This is the working document that Assistant Lin gave me earlier.

689
00:37:57,659 --> 00:38:00,559
I have updated some basic information that has changed

690
00:38:00,559 --> 00:38:04,739
and have added some new content and notes separately

691
00:38:04,739 --> 00:38:06,220
on the last page.

692
00:38:06,220 --> 00:38:07,739
You can just read that page.

693
00:38:07,739 --> 00:38:09,859
Assistant Wu will come over this afternoon.

694
00:38:09,859 --> 00:38:12,020
If you think there's nothing wrong with that,

695
00:38:12,020 --> 00:38:14,420
I'll hand over my work to her like this.

696
00:38:18,660 --> 00:38:22,270
It is said that couples should maintain a proper sense of mystery between them.

697
00:38:22,270 --> 00:38:24,090
Seeing these details, I can't help wondering.

698
00:38:24,090 --> 00:38:26,730
Do you know me like the back of your hand?

699
00:38:27,500 --> 00:38:31,299
Therefore, I need to give you some space.

700
00:38:31,980 --> 00:38:36,519
In that case, it's really a bit sad to see you go back to Pediatrics.

701
00:38:36,519 --> 00:38:41,620
Then I'll take it as a summarized praise that you gave me for my assistant's work.

702
00:38:42,840 --> 00:38:45,820
Well done! Assistant Ye.

703
00:38:47,080 --> 00:38:49,079
Thank you, President.

704
00:38:50,439 --> 00:38:54,099
Hi, Qiao Yu. Do you want me to bring your deliveries to you?

705
00:38:54,099 --> 00:38:55,939
<i>No, I'll go to get them later.</i>

706
00:38:55,939 --> 00:38:56,920
Okay.

707
00:38:56,920 --> 00:39:01,459
<i>By the way, is there anything simple and delicious to eat that you recommend around here?</i>

708
00:39:01,459 --> 00:39:03,799
Let me see.

709
00:39:03,799 --> 00:39:05,919
What do you want to eat?

710
00:39:07,360 --> 00:39:08,480
Thanks.

711
00:39:08,480 --> 00:39:10,679
No problem. Please wait a moment.

712
00:39:11,619 --> 00:39:13,518
My friends and I often come here to eat.

713
00:39:13,518 --> 00:39:15,779
We think the food is okay.

714
00:39:15,779 --> 00:39:17,578
I've recently become so tired of eating packed lunches for the crew.

715
00:39:17,578 --> 00:39:19,219
It's good to eat something else.

716
00:39:19,219 --> 00:39:20,778
I'm not disturbing you, am I?

717
00:39:20,778 --> 00:39:24,499
Not at all. We seldom have lunch together.

718
00:39:24,499 --> 00:39:27,800
Are you afraid of being bumped into by others?

719
00:39:30,779 --> 00:39:34,400
Did Dr. Zeng say anything to you later that day?

720
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:37,860
Nope. We didn't talk about it.

721
00:39:39,420 --> 00:39:41,420
I was quite surprised

722
00:39:41,420 --> 00:39:44,020
that Lu Zhaoxi was willing to keep your relationship a secret.

723
00:39:44,020 --> 00:39:45,579
Surprised?

724
00:39:46,139 --> 00:39:48,059
According to my understanding of him,

725
00:39:48,059 --> 00:39:51,179
he is quite high-profile in his love relationships.

726
00:39:51,179 --> 00:39:52,918
He would like everyone around him to know

727
00:39:52,919 --> 00:39:54,680
so that he can share his happiness.

728
00:39:54,680 --> 00:39:56,560
Would he?

729
00:39:57,600 --> 00:40:01,039
He never mentioned it to me in a serious way.

730
00:40:01,039 --> 00:40:03,219
So he must really like you.

731
00:40:03,219 --> 00:40:05,299
He cares about you, respects you,

732
00:40:05,299 --> 00:40:09,259
and would rather keep it to himself than put you in an embarrassing position.

733
00:40:27,819 --> 00:40:29,579
Hello, who's there?

734
00:40:30,500 --> 00:40:32,760
I don't need a loan. Thank you.

735
00:40:42,700 --> 00:40:45,139
