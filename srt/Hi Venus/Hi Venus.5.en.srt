16
00:01:38,940 --> 00:01:41,219
You're working for Chief Huang?

17
00:01:43,319 --> 00:01:45,179
That's great.

18
00:01:45,179 --> 00:01:46,960
If you had done this earlier,

19
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:50,810
you probably wouldn't have needed to stay in Taoyuan Village for so long.

20
00:01:53,060 --> 00:01:56,299
Are you educating me or laughing at me?

21
00:01:57,319 --> 00:01:59,079
You see, don't be rash.

22
00:01:59,080 --> 00:02:01,099
Yeah, that's me.

23
00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:11,060
It doesn't matter what you think.

24
00:02:11,060 --> 00:02:15,039
I just hope that you don't get stuck in the past and move on.

25
00:02:15,099 --> 00:02:17,060
It's good for all of us.

26
00:02:19,759 --> 00:02:21,079
Don't worry.

27
00:02:21,079 --> 00:02:24,260
I won't bother you and Dr. Xu.

28
00:02:31,420 --> 00:02:33,420
If you need any help...

29
00:02:33,420 --> 00:02:34,980
Dr. Jiang.

30
00:02:34,980 --> 00:02:38,539
Where did you buy the toy stethoscope?

31
00:02:38,539 --> 00:02:39,879
I will send you the link later.

32
00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:42,399
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

33
00:02:52,220 --> 00:02:54,220
The President's Mailbox has been published for several days.

34
00:02:54,220 --> 00:02:56,900
I only received these innocuous emails.

35
00:02:56,900 --> 00:02:59,960
It seems everyone's enthusiasm is not highly receptive.

36
00:03:03,060 --> 00:03:07,260
No one wants to tell me the problem, that's the biggest problem.

37
00:03:07,860 --> 00:03:10,120
Do you have any other information?

38
00:03:10,819 --> 00:03:12,420
I have one about your privacy.

39
00:03:12,420 --> 00:03:14,739
I can't decide whether it's helpful or not.

40
00:03:14,739 --> 00:03:16,260
My privacy?

41
00:03:16,260 --> 00:03:18,579
Your performance in the promotion event of painless delivery.

42
00:03:18,579 --> 00:03:20,040
It has spread among the doctors.

43
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:23,880
The female doctors especially admire you a lot.

44
00:03:25,459 --> 00:03:27,520
It doesn't sound all that helpful.

45
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:29,680
But I'm happy to hear that.

46
00:03:30,579 --> 00:03:32,659
But it reminds me,

47
00:03:32,659 --> 00:03:35,459
I need to do something now to break the deadlock.

48
00:03:35,459 --> 00:03:38,650
Let them know that it is more valuable to make suggestions.

49
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:40,879
Do you have any plans?

50
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:42,140
Yeah.

51
00:03:42,140 --> 00:03:43,579
It was supposed to be promoted gradually.

52
00:03:43,579 --> 00:03:47,539
But for now, maybe a positive breakthrough is the best way.

53
00:03:47,539 --> 00:03:50,680
Well. Go to pediatrics and get the doctors' schedules.

54
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:52,420
Now is a perfect time.

55
00:03:52,420 --> 00:03:53,800
Okay.

56
00:04:05,260 --> 00:04:08,500
It's not Lu Zhaoxi's style.

57
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:11,099
Why has he suddenly stopped making trouble for you?

58
00:04:11,099 --> 00:04:14,220
That day, we spoke ill of him secretly.

59
00:04:15,019 --> 00:04:17,620
He may have become nice

60
00:04:17,620 --> 00:04:19,579
and decided not to trouble me.

61
00:04:20,599 --> 00:04:24,738
If a man gets soft-hearted, maybe he will fall in love with you.

62
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:29,859
You are the first one who dares to talk with me like that.

63
00:04:29,859 --> 00:04:32,978
Damn it. So attractive.

64
00:04:32,978 --> 00:04:36,339
Shut up. Don't talk nonsense.

65
00:04:36,339 --> 00:04:39,120
In your mind, is he so bad?

66
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:43,579
He is great, it's me who can't afford it.

67
00:04:49,279 --> 00:04:51,900
I really want a house.

68
00:04:54,380 --> 00:04:58,320
I want to write a trendy novel.

69
00:04:59,940 --> 00:05:02,199
Chief Huang doesn't schedule shifts for me.

70
00:05:02,199 --> 00:05:03,660
So bored.

71
00:05:03,660 --> 00:05:06,118
My fans often threaten to give up reading my novel.

72
00:05:06,119 --> 00:05:07,199
So sad.

73
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:10,423
We're in such a bad mood.

74
00:05:10,423 --> 00:05:12,440
How to remove our bad mood?

75
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:15,559
- Food delivery?
- Yes.

76
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,139
How about a barbecue?

77
00:05:22,139 --> 00:05:24,940
- I want roasted eggplant...
- ...with garlic.

78
00:05:31,179 --> 00:05:34,259
Chief Huang, this is a physical file. Already proofread.

79
00:05:34,259 --> 00:05:37,739
I've also sent an email to you, a digital version.

80
00:05:37,739 --> 00:05:39,898
Good. How do you feel?

81
00:05:39,898 --> 00:05:43,720
You learned a lot from that, right?

82
00:05:45,279 --> 00:05:46,399
Okay.

83
00:05:46,399 --> 00:05:48,459
And I have some more materials.

84
00:05:48,459 --> 00:05:51,500
Please organize according to this standard.

85
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:57,159
Chief Huang, what about my schedule?

86
00:05:57,160 --> 00:05:58,999
Complete these first.

87
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,858
I told you before. I'll arrange shifts soon.

88
00:06:02,799 --> 00:06:05,259
I get a salary, but have no shifts.

89
00:06:05,259 --> 00:06:07,500
I feel guilty.

90
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:10,078
Please adjust it again at your convenience.

91
00:06:10,079 --> 00:06:14,238
And don't worry, I'll also organize the materials as soon as possible.

92
00:06:14,238 --> 00:06:16,599
I told you, about the shift arrangement,

93
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:18,719
it needs to be considered a lot.

94
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:20,719
If I adjust according to your suggestion,

95
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:23,979
how about you taking over my position? Is that better?

96
00:06:23,979 --> 00:06:26,698
-Chief Huang.
- Well, I don't think we need to discuss it any more.

97
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:29,159
- Chief Huang.
- It's the president.

98
00:06:29,159 --> 00:06:31,278
- Don't get angry.
- President.

99
00:06:31,279 --> 00:06:34,378
I wanted to have a talk with you, and heard your discussion by accident.

100
00:06:34,378 --> 00:06:38,098
I think it's my dereliction of duty as the president, so I have to interrupt.

101
00:06:38,098 --> 00:06:40,958
President, what you have said sounds too serious.

102
00:06:40,959 --> 00:06:43,919
However, it's just a small problem within our department.

103
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:45,820
I've solved it.

104
00:06:45,820 --> 00:06:47,380
Excuse me.

105
00:06:47,380 --> 00:06:48,979
Dr. Ye.

106
00:06:49,640 --> 00:06:52,660
Regarding the shifts, Chief Huang must have his own difficulties,

107
00:06:52,660 --> 00:06:54,699
thanks for your understanding.

108
00:06:56,359 --> 00:07:01,059
But, Chief Huang, what Doctor Ye said just now makes sense.

109
00:07:01,059 --> 00:07:02,579
Just getting paid and doing nothing.

110
00:07:02,620 --> 00:07:07,360
I, as the president, don't want to see this.

111
00:07:08,359 --> 00:07:11,780
President, your opinion is...?

112
00:07:11,780 --> 00:07:13,660
I need an assistant now.

113
00:07:13,660 --> 00:07:16,039
Dr. Ye's workload isn't so heavy,

114
00:07:16,039 --> 00:07:17,780
why doesn't she work for me?

115
00:07:17,780 --> 00:07:19,100
How about that?

116
00:07:19,100 --> 00:07:24,179
Well, Doctor Ye... As an assistant, is it okay?

117
00:07:24,179 --> 00:07:26,399
I think she can have a try.

118
00:07:27,799 --> 00:07:30,159
-I can wait for shifts.
- You can leave for now.

119
00:07:30,159 --> 00:07:32,259
I'll talk with you later.

120
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:47,679
What happened?

121
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:53,580
I thought he showing me kindness...

122
00:07:53,580 --> 00:07:55,859
Is he making his move?

123
00:07:58,760 --> 00:07:59,719
President Lu.

124
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:01,660
Well, if you need any help,

125
00:08:01,660 --> 00:08:03,100
you can ask Assistant Lin to inform me.

126
00:08:03,100 --> 00:08:05,879
It's too much that you had to come here yourself.

127
00:08:05,879 --> 00:08:08,380
I said I would supervise the documentary myself.

128
00:08:08,380 --> 00:08:11,319
It's also related to pediatrics. Please confirm and sign.

129
00:08:11,319 --> 00:08:14,579
If you have any questions, I'm here to answer.

130
00:08:14,579 --> 00:08:17,039
It's very considerate of you.

131
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:18,739
I have no questions.

132
00:08:18,739 --> 00:08:20,759
Here you are.

133
00:08:20,759 --> 00:08:22,660
Okay, thanks a lot.

134
00:08:22,660 --> 00:08:24,179
- Yeah.
- Take care.

135
00:08:24,179 --> 00:08:28,560
Oh, rihgt. Will you mind Doctor Ye working for me as my assistant?

136
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:32,058
Of course not, or I'd still have a headache to deal with.

137
00:08:32,059 --> 00:08:33,640
Great.

138
00:08:54,239 --> 00:08:56,399
- President.
- Come in.

139
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,679
Sit down.

140
00:09:20,359 --> 00:09:22,320
Who starts first? You or me?

141
00:09:23,699 --> 00:09:27,920
President, I talked about you secretly that day.

142
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:29,139
I apologize.

143
00:09:29,139 --> 00:09:31,340
Starting with an apology?

144
00:09:31,340 --> 00:09:34,139
Is it so hard for you to be my assistant?

145
00:09:34,139 --> 00:09:36,259
I'm afraid I'm not qualified.

146
00:09:36,259 --> 00:09:39,238
As my assistant, you just need to follow my orders.

147
00:09:39,239 --> 00:09:40,999
Due to your performance in Taoyuan Village,

148
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,320
I think you're totally qualified.

149
00:09:44,860 --> 00:09:47,660
I don't have any prejudices about this position,

150
00:09:47,660 --> 00:09:51,259
ut it's too different from my job.

151
00:09:51,259 --> 00:09:53,479
I want to work as a doctor.

152
00:10:00,860 --> 00:10:04,420
You should know it's me who allowed your transfer.

153
00:10:05,740 --> 00:10:06,780
Yeah, I guessed it.

154
00:10:06,780 --> 00:10:08,699
Based on your understanding,

155
00:10:08,699 --> 00:10:11,350
when will Chief Huang arrange shifts for you?

156
00:10:13,081 --> 00:10:15,780
- I don't know.
- It's you who have no idea.

157
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:21,000
When you were in Taoyuan, you were positive and outgoing.

158
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,899
On the contrary, you aren't happy when you came back.

159
00:10:23,899 --> 00:10:27,980
So it seems, my good intentions ended with bad results.

160
00:10:29,139 --> 00:10:31,100
If you do want to help me,

161
00:10:31,100 --> 00:10:35,658
why don't you tell Director Huang to schedule me as soon as possible?

162
00:10:38,900 --> 00:10:43,700
You asked me to uphold justice because you think Director Huang is unfair to you.

163
00:10:43,740 --> 00:10:45,620
That's not doing it right.

164
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:50,019
Anything else?

165
00:10:51,300 --> 00:10:53,019
- Yeah.
- Okay.

166
00:10:53,019 --> 00:10:54,860
Then let me tell you what I think.

167
00:10:54,860 --> 00:10:56,619
I just need an assistant temporarily.

168
00:10:56,619 --> 00:10:58,599
Because my assistant is taking maternal leave.

169
00:10:58,599 --> 00:11:00,540
When she's back, you can go back to being a doctor.

170
00:11:00,540 --> 00:11:02,100
And as return,

171
00:11:02,100 --> 00:11:04,810
I'll help you to solve your problem.

172
00:11:06,540 --> 00:11:10,000
You can think about it and reply to me later.

173
00:11:11,640 --> 00:11:13,359
Any questions?

174
00:11:13,359 --> 00:11:14,939
No.

175
00:11:17,839 --> 00:11:19,960
Okay, then I'll take my leave.

176
00:11:23,420 --> 00:11:25,619
When can I get a reply from you?

177
00:11:25,619 --> 00:11:27,619
I'm waiting for someone to help me with my work.

178
00:11:27,619 --> 00:11:30,499
After all, the assistant position has been vacant for a long time.

179
00:11:30,499 --> 00:11:32,499
We've received a lot of resumes.

180
00:11:33,139 --> 00:11:34,780
As soon as possible.

181
00:11:35,340 --> 00:11:36,980
Today.

182
00:11:37,699 --> 00:11:39,740
Today, I'll reply.

183
00:11:40,819 --> 00:11:42,599
Consider it properly.

184
00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:02,500
Hi, Mom.

185
00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:05,058
<i>Hi, Lan. Did you have your lunch?</i>

186
00:12:05,058 --> 00:12:06,439
I'm going to eat it later.

187
00:12:06,439 --> 00:12:07,779
<i>This is the case.</i>

188
00:12:07,779 --> 00:12:10,518
<i>Our neighbor, Aunt Zhang. Her granddaughter is only one year old.</i>

189
00:12:10,518 --> 00:12:12,300
<i>And she knows you are a doctor,</i>

190
00:12:12,300 --> 00:12:14,339
<i>and wants to ask you some questions.</i>

191
00:12:14,339 --> 00:12:15,600
<i>Is it okay?</i>

192
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:16,540
<i>Yeah.</i>

193
00:12:16,540 --> 00:12:18,779
Let her answer the phone.

194
00:12:18,779 --> 00:12:20,839
<i>Hello, Dr. Ye.</i>

195
00:12:20,839 --> 00:12:22,440
Aunt Zhang.

196
00:12:23,119 --> 00:12:26,618
<i>I have a granddaughter. And I have some questions.</i>

197
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:39,980
<i>Thanks, Dr. Ye.</i>

198
00:12:39,980 --> 00:12:43,379
<i>You're welcome. I will hand over the phone to your mom.</i>

199
00:12:43,379 --> 00:12:45,019
Okay, Aunt Zhang.

200
00:12:45,019 --> 00:12:48,585
<i>Wang Mei, it's great that your daughter is a pediatrician.</i>

201
00:12:48,585 --> 00:12:50,839
<i>It will be convenient when you have grandchildren.</i>

202
00:12:50,840 --> 00:12:52,900
<i>Yes, that's for sure.</i>

203
00:12:52,900 --> 00:12:55,099
<i>- Hello Lan.</i>
- Mom.

204
00:12:55,099 --> 00:12:57,840
<i>Is everything okay at work?</i>

205
00:12:57,840 --> 00:13:00,659
Yeah, everything is fine.

206
00:13:00,659 --> 00:13:03,020
If there are no other questions, I'll go to have lunch now.

207
00:13:03,020 --> 00:13:05,400
<i>Yeah, just go.</i>

208
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:08,120
Take care of yourself, too. Bye.

209
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:09,819
<i>Bye-bye.</i>

210
00:13:42,080 --> 00:13:46,120
- Hello. Check out the Boutique Apartment. If necessary, you can call me.
- Thanks.

211
00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:49,299
Hello. Check out the Boutique Apartment. If necessary, you can call me.

212
00:13:49,299 --> 00:13:51,159
Boutique Apartment ranges from 40 to 60 sq.m.

213
00:13:51,159 --> 00:13:53,560
If necessary, you can call me.

214
00:13:54,259 --> 00:13:55,879
Boutique Apartment ranges from 40 to 60 sq.m.

215
00:13:55,880 --> 00:13:59,230
Have a look. If necessary, you can call me.

216
00:13:59,230 --> 00:14:00,990
<i>[150 Boutique Apartments ranging from 40 to 60 sq.m.]</i>

217
00:14:14,670 --> 00:14:16,490
<i>[Pediatric Department]</i>

218
00:14:19,180 --> 00:14:20,880
Dr. Xu.

219
00:14:24,259 --> 00:14:26,120
Come on, exactly three.

220
00:14:26,120 --> 00:14:29,939
For you. For you.

221
00:14:29,939 --> 00:14:33,319
Dr. Li, what are you...

222
00:14:34,100 --> 00:14:35,459
Chief Huang told us just now.

223
00:14:35,459 --> 00:14:37,220
You're going to be the assistant to the president.

224
00:14:37,220 --> 00:14:39,199
So we will share the teamwork.

225
00:14:39,199 --> 00:14:41,659
But I haven't replied yet.

226
00:14:44,420 --> 00:14:46,879
You don't want to go?

227
00:14:46,879 --> 00:14:48,519
I need to think about it.

228
00:14:48,519 --> 00:14:52,118
The president has appointed you. Do you want to reject him?

229
00:14:54,459 --> 00:14:58,159
It's okay. We can do this first while waiting for your decision.

230
00:14:58,159 --> 00:15:01,180
Chief Huang's order can't be delayed.

231
00:15:01,180 --> 00:15:02,699
Okay.

232
00:15:07,679 --> 00:15:10,359
Time is up. Let's work now.

233
00:15:39,636 --> 00:15:43,279
Okay. That's the surgical plan.

234
00:15:43,279 --> 00:15:47,400
Dr. Meng, you should explain the consultation content

235
00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:49,220
and operation risk clearly with parents.

236
00:15:49,220 --> 00:15:50,860
Yes, Dean Xu.

237
00:15:50,860 --> 00:15:53,640
Okay, that's all. Thank you.

238
00:16:06,559 --> 00:16:10,539
Dean Xu, I need to report something.

239
00:16:10,539 --> 00:16:12,119
Go ahead.

240
00:16:15,139 --> 00:16:17,059
Flower means yes, words means no.

241
00:16:17,059 --> 00:16:19,640
Flower means yes, words means no.

242
00:16:31,559 --> 00:16:33,239
Yes?

243
00:16:33,719 --> 00:16:35,499
One more time.

244
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:42,960
No?

245
00:16:43,980 --> 00:16:46,080
What should I do?

246
00:16:47,220 --> 00:16:49,339
One more time.

247
00:16:58,080 --> 00:17:00,080
For the last time.

248
00:17:08,859 --> 00:17:10,540
This is the last time.

249
00:17:18,979 --> 00:17:20,780
One last time.

250
00:17:26,460 --> 00:17:30,619
A doctor is going to be his assistant, does that make sense?

251
00:17:30,619 --> 00:17:31,900
Yeah.

252
00:17:31,900 --> 00:17:35,979
And I'm going to the Human Resources Department to ask around.

253
00:17:35,979 --> 00:17:39,459
Is it so difficult to hire an assistant for President Lu?

254
00:17:39,459 --> 00:17:42,519
The Human Resource Department said that it was Vice President Gao

255
00:17:42,520 --> 00:17:44,378
who supervised that.

256
00:17:44,378 --> 00:17:49,060
But President Lu wasn't satisfied with the candidates.

257
00:17:49,839 --> 00:17:52,579
He likes to play small tricks.

258
00:17:52,579 --> 00:17:56,220
Right. And that Assistant Lin,

259
00:17:56,220 --> 00:18:00,900
he is asking around about your and Deputy President Gao's past.

260
00:18:00,900 --> 00:18:06,199
And about Ye Shilan's transfer, it was President Lu who approved it.

261
00:18:06,199 --> 00:18:09,640
I thought Vice President Gao who arranged that.

262
00:18:09,640 --> 00:18:12,699
If he wants to investigate the truth and support justice,

263
00:18:12,699 --> 00:18:14,440
let him do it.

264
00:18:14,440 --> 00:18:17,660
It's not me who should be worried.

265
00:18:18,900 --> 00:18:21,950
Then about the assistant,

266
00:18:21,950 --> 00:18:23,979
will you ask about that?

267
00:18:23,979 --> 00:18:28,119
If the doctor doesn't agree, I will help.

268
00:18:29,139 --> 00:18:33,800
Well, I don't know what he wants to do.

269
00:18:33,800 --> 00:18:37,899
You don't know his plan. Just wait and see.

270
00:18:37,899 --> 00:18:39,760
Let's go.

271
00:18:46,850 --> 00:18:48,340
My friend.

272
00:18:48,340 --> 00:18:51,840
Well, now you should take care of our employees' health.

273
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:54,179
Don't worry. We'll guarantee the best service.

274
00:18:54,179 --> 00:18:56,378
Great. That's it for today.

275
00:18:56,378 --> 00:18:58,099
Let's have dinner another day.

276
00:18:58,099 --> 00:18:59,300
Then I'll ask you another day.

277
00:18:59,300 --> 00:19:01,939
Thanks a lot.

278
00:19:10,379 --> 00:19:13,159
It's time to get off work. I won't go back to the office.

279
00:19:13,159 --> 00:19:14,900
Come on, help me bring this back to my office.

280
00:19:14,900 --> 00:19:17,080
- Okay.
- See you later.

281
00:19:17,080 --> 00:19:20,560
Oh, right. Does Dr. Ye agree to be your assistant?

282
00:19:20,560 --> 00:19:23,580
She is a little hesitant. Let her think about it.

283
00:19:23,580 --> 00:19:26,600
Or she will speak ill of me again.

284
00:19:37,719 --> 00:19:39,139
So smug.

285
00:19:39,139 --> 00:19:41,059
Hello, Chief Huang.

286
00:19:41,979 --> 00:19:43,460
Okay.

287
00:19:43,460 --> 00:19:45,039
Okay, I understand.

288
00:19:45,039 --> 00:19:47,019
Then, see you.

289
00:19:50,840 --> 00:19:53,339
He scheduled a dinner again?

290
00:19:53,339 --> 00:19:55,100
Bingo.

291
00:19:56,079 --> 00:19:57,619
It's enough.

292
00:19:57,619 --> 00:19:59,338
My mom asked me to go to on blind date.

293
00:19:59,338 --> 00:20:01,258
If you have to go, tell Chief Huang about it.

294
00:20:01,258 --> 00:20:03,379
I don't think you'll be able to. I saw him this afternoon.

295
00:20:03,379 --> 00:20:05,259
It looked like he was in a bad mood.

296
00:20:05,259 --> 00:20:07,160
What? Why does he like to have dinners with us?

297
00:20:07,160 --> 00:20:08,399
Can we call it dinner?

298
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:09,979
It's a part of our work. Even without payment.

299
00:20:09,979 --> 00:20:11,779
Sometimes we split the bill.

300
00:20:11,779 --> 00:20:15,399
We may be late. Let's go.

301
00:20:17,700 --> 00:20:19,800
Dr. Ye, are you going with us?

302
00:20:19,800 --> 00:20:21,859
Dr. Ye doesn't like going.

303
00:20:21,859 --> 00:20:23,580
and now she is the assistant of the president.

304
00:20:23,580 --> 00:20:25,719
There is no need for her to join us.

305
00:20:26,379 --> 00:20:29,239
I'm not going. You can go.

306
00:20:29,239 --> 00:20:30,859
Let's go.

307
00:20:31,599 --> 00:20:33,339
<i>Let's go. Let's go.</i>

308
00:20:33,339 --> 00:20:34,619
The wet hair guy pays for the taxi.

309
00:20:34,619 --> 00:20:36,060
<i>It's nearby. No need for a taxi.</i>

310
00:20:36,060 --> 00:20:38,039
<i>Let's go on foot.</i>

311
00:20:45,180 --> 00:20:48,139
<i>I'll finish my work soon. Have some pan-fried pork buns?</i>

312
00:20:48,139 --> 00:20:50,180
<i>I'll be your consultant.</i>

313
00:20:58,139 --> 00:21:04,159
It's really strange that Lu Zhaoxi wants to transfer you to be his assistant.

314
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:07,700
That's why I struggled. I didn't do anything this afternoon.

315
00:21:08,959 --> 00:21:12,018
But... they didn't give me any work to do either.

316
00:21:14,139 --> 00:21:15,900
I have one question.

317
00:21:18,019 --> 00:21:21,519
Why don't you want to be his assistant?

318
00:21:22,019 --> 00:21:23,780
Because I want to be a doctor.

319
00:21:23,780 --> 00:21:27,438
But now you have no shift schedule at all. How can you become a doctor?

320
00:21:27,438 --> 00:21:29,919
The chief will arrange my shifts sooner or later.

321
00:21:29,919 --> 00:21:31,218
Sooner or later?

322
00:21:31,218 --> 00:21:32,540
Three months?

323
00:21:32,540 --> 00:21:34,539
Or a half year?

324
00:21:39,700 --> 00:21:42,339
Did you think about resigning to work at another hospital?

325
00:21:42,339 --> 00:21:43,760
I didn't.

326
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:46,418
I can have better welfare here. And no-interest loans.

327
00:21:46,418 --> 00:21:48,720
I want to buy a house.

328
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:51,040
So if you accept to be his temporary assistant,

329
00:21:51,100 --> 00:21:55,100
do you think Lu Zhaoxi will do what he promised and solve your shift problems?

330
00:21:56,680 --> 00:22:00,100
He always bears a grudge against people,

331
00:22:00,100 --> 00:22:02,280
but he is a man of his word.

332
00:22:02,280 --> 00:22:03,600
I trust him.

333
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:04,979
So you have your answer.

334
00:22:04,979 --> 00:22:09,579
In all, it is the best way to meet all your needs.

335
00:22:09,579 --> 00:22:11,960
What are you struggling with?

336
00:22:11,960 --> 00:22:14,599
You just said something was wrong.

337
00:22:14,599 --> 00:22:17,919
Don't you think there's something wrong with his motives?

338
00:23:05,719 --> 00:23:07,940
You suspect that Lu Zhaoxi wanted to transfer you as an assistant

339
00:23:07,940 --> 00:23:11,719
just to get closer to you and it would be more convenient to settle accounts with you?

340
00:23:13,499 --> 00:23:15,259
It's not impossible.

341
00:23:15,259 --> 00:23:16,838
It's possible.

342
00:23:16,839 --> 00:23:18,480
He'll definitely do it.

343
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:19,420
Are you afraid?

344
00:23:19,420 --> 00:23:21,239
Of course I am.

345
00:23:21,239 --> 00:23:23,699
Otherwise, what am I doing hiding from him?

346
00:23:23,699 --> 00:23:27,339
You are afraid to show that you are ashamed.

347
00:23:29,759 --> 00:23:32,699
We had a misunderstanding before,

348
00:23:32,699 --> 00:23:34,580
so my attitude towards him...

349
00:23:34,580 --> 00:23:37,460
was indeed... a bit bad.

350
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:45,119
Don't you think that Lu Zhaoxi is a bit childish, like a little kid?

351
00:23:45,119 --> 00:23:47,098
If you behave more anxiously or hide from him,

352
00:23:47,098 --> 00:23:50,219
he will find more fun from it.

353
00:23:51,280 --> 00:23:55,519
That's why he came up with the bad idea of making me an assistant.

354
00:23:55,519 --> 00:23:57,319
This is critical.

355
00:23:57,319 --> 00:24:01,738
If you reject him this time, it might become more trouble next time.

356
00:24:01,738 --> 00:24:05,640
Even fall in love with you in the end!

357
00:24:05,640 --> 00:24:07,039
Don't scare me.

358
00:24:07,039 --> 00:24:10,578
I didn't mean to. I am analyzing the pros and cons.

359
00:24:10,578 --> 00:24:12,680
So what is the conclusion?

360
00:24:14,460 --> 00:24:16,200
Promise him.

361
00:24:16,820 --> 00:24:18,179
Not just any promise.

362
00:24:18,179 --> 00:24:20,459
You have to beat him down with all your redemptive zeal.

363
00:24:20,459 --> 00:24:25,620
Make him feel that revenge on you is pointless.

364
00:24:26,099 --> 00:24:29,000
I feel like I'm looking for abuse.

365
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:31,020
You'll be at ease after this.

366
00:24:31,020 --> 00:24:32,300
Don't avoid him anymore.

367
00:24:32,300 --> 00:24:36,819
You will have a schedule and your new house.

368
00:24:39,060 --> 00:24:41,299
It doesn't sound too bad.

369
00:24:41,299 --> 00:24:43,459
Suddenly seeing the light?

370
00:24:44,099 --> 00:24:46,840
Fine. Don't worry about it.

371
00:24:46,840 --> 00:24:49,639
There is always a solution to a problem.

372
00:24:49,639 --> 00:24:51,679
Right. This is like you.

373
00:24:51,679 --> 00:24:55,499
Here, one for each of us. I have the night shift later.

374
00:24:55,499 --> 00:24:56,640
Come.

375
00:24:56,640 --> 00:24:58,719
Cheers.

376
00:25:20,820 --> 00:25:27,419
<i>Sorry. The number you dialed can not be answered, please try again later.</i>

377
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:28,590
<i>[President Lu: Mobile Phone]</i>

378
00:25:44,219 --> 00:25:45,630
Hello, Assistant Lin.

379
00:25:45,630 --> 00:25:47,280
<i>He's still not answering?</i>

380
00:25:47,280 --> 00:25:51,498
He is not. You're in a hurry to find him for business or personal reasons?

381
00:25:51,498 --> 00:25:53,939
If you are calling about business, I'll tell him what you want.

382
00:25:53,939 --> 00:25:57,959
It's business, but also personal matters.

383
00:25:57,959 --> 00:26:00,739
I still want to talk to him in person.

384
00:26:00,739 --> 00:26:03,638
Do you know where he will head later? I can wait for him there.

385
00:26:03,638 --> 00:26:05,098
I am not sure about it.

386
00:26:05,098 --> 00:26:06,839
I called his home. No one is answering.

387
00:26:06,839 --> 00:26:08,239
I guess he is not home.

388
00:26:08,239 --> 00:26:10,600
I will wait for him where he lives.

389
00:26:10,600 --> 00:26:12,060
Thanks for your time.

390
00:26:12,060 --> 00:26:13,640
No problem.

391
00:26:21,560 --> 00:26:23,720
It's about to rain.

392
00:26:23,720 --> 00:26:26,640
I shouldn't have wasted my time for so long.

393
00:27:43,060 --> 00:27:45,660
Hello. What's going on?

394
00:27:45,660 --> 00:27:48,160
<i>I'm not looking for you. It's Dr. Ye.</i>

395
00:27:48,160 --> 00:27:51,820
<i>She doesn't know your phone number, so she called me for help.</i>

396
00:27:51,820 --> 00:27:53,080
What does she want?

397
00:27:53,080 --> 00:27:55,698
<i>I don't know. She wanted to meet you.</i>

398
00:27:55,698 --> 00:27:57,639
<i>I feel it's urgent.</i>

399
00:27:57,639 --> 00:28:01,719
She said she'd go to the gate of your neighborhood to try her luck. I'm guessing she is already there.

400
00:28:01,719 --> 00:28:04,278
Okay, I got it. I'll take care of this.

401
00:28:04,278 --> 00:28:05,780
<i>Sure.</i>

402
00:28:26,420 --> 00:28:28,839
Should I wait on the other side?

403
00:29:00,096 --> 00:29:05,050
♫ <i>You are a part of my life</i> ♫

404

00:29:07,916 --> 00:29:11,036

♫ <i>We will come to the end. Trust me</i> ♫

407
00:29:16,198 --> 00:29:19,939
President Lu, I won't go inside.

408
00:29:20,820 --> 00:29:23,640
Do you want to talk with me in the rain?

409
00:29:23,640 --> 00:29:25,660
Or you don't believe in my character?

410
00:29:25,660 --> 00:29:29,419
I do. I believe in you.

411
00:29:30,499 --> 00:29:33,938
Let's go and care for your wounds. Don't get infected.

♫ <i>Just with you </i> ♫

418
00:30:15,580 --> 00:30:17,260
Do you need a room tour?

419
00:30:17,260 --> 00:30:18,800
No.

420
00:30:19,619 --> 00:30:21,739
How did you know where I lived?

421
00:30:21,739 --> 00:30:25,379
The clinic has your profile.

422
00:30:25,379 --> 00:30:28,858
After knowing you're not selling medicinal wine, I rechecked it.

423
00:30:28,858 --> 00:30:31,079
The profile is true.

424
00:30:32,499 --> 00:30:36,299
You got soaked in the rain. Drink some medicine. I'll get you the Iodophor.

425
00:30:36,299 --> 00:30:37,479
Thank you.

426
00:30:37,479 --> 00:30:39,280
Take a seat.

427
00:30:59,460 --> 00:31:02,318
It's not convenient for you, let me help you.

428
00:31:18,099 --> 00:31:19,640
It's done.

429
00:31:21,400 --> 00:31:22,920
Thank you.

430
00:31:28,879 --> 00:31:30,939
I remember it was raining that day, too.

431
00:31:30,939 --> 00:31:35,100
I was soaked in a mess with your goat in my arms.

432
00:31:35,100 --> 00:31:37,680
Today, we changed positions.

433
00:31:41,019 --> 00:31:44,160
President Lu, I've made up my mind.

434
00:31:44,160 --> 00:31:46,619
I'll be your temporary assistant.

435
00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:50,999
You came to me in a hurry for this?

436
00:31:50,999 --> 00:31:52,978
I said I would reply today.

437
00:31:52,978 --> 00:31:56,339
And... I want to make it clear to you.

438
00:31:57,859 --> 00:32:00,580
Trustworthiness is indeed a good quality.

439
00:32:00,580 --> 00:32:03,599
But are you sure you thought it through?

440
00:32:03,599 --> 00:32:06,319
I've thought it through very clearly.

441
00:32:06,319 --> 00:32:09,759
You said we'll calculate our debt one by one.

442
00:32:09,759 --> 00:32:15,079
And I know, you want revenge so you want me to be your assistant.

443
00:32:15,079 --> 00:32:16,739
Are you all right?

444
00:32:16,739 --> 00:32:19,118
I am good. Go on.

445
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:26,899
I know I did wrong to you before, so I am so sorry.

446
00:32:26,899 --> 00:32:29,459
I can understand you hating me.

447
00:32:29,459 --> 00:32:32,460
So... I don't want to escape from you now.

448
00:32:32,460 --> 00:32:34,980
I'll help you to vent your anger.

449
00:32:37,139 --> 00:32:40,279
Obviously, you understand it.

450
00:32:40,279 --> 00:32:45,880
Just in a day, how did you think it through?

451
00:32:45,880 --> 00:32:47,980
I talked with my best girlfriend,

452
00:32:47,980 --> 00:32:52,819
after her analysis, I remembered a news article I saw before.

453
00:32:52,819 --> 00:32:54,680
What was it?

454
00:32:55,639 --> 00:32:58,920
This comparison may not be appropriate.

455
00:32:58,920 --> 00:33:01,358
It's okay. I'm listening.

456
00:33:03,239 --> 00:33:07,680
A woman found her husband had an affair.

457
00:33:07,680 --> 00:33:10,219
The husband begged for her forgiveness.

458
00:33:10,219 --> 00:33:13,898
But she said she would forgive him if she could have an affair, too.

459
00:33:13,898 --> 00:33:15,879
He accepted it.

460
00:33:15,879 --> 00:33:18,758
So every day he couldn't focus on what he was doing.

461
00:33:18,758 --> 00:33:21,959
Because he was thinking about when she would have an affair.

462
00:33:21,959 --> 00:33:25,319
And he almost lost his mind about it.

463
00:33:25,319 --> 00:33:30,319
It's not a good story to explain our relationship, but it's reasonable.

464
00:33:30,319 --> 00:33:34,459
So you want an answer once and for all?

465
00:33:34,459 --> 00:33:36,060
Yes.

466
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:41,700
You seem less reserved.

467
00:33:42,440 --> 00:33:44,790
Is it so obvious?

468
00:33:45,400 --> 00:33:50,119
Actually, when I talked to you, I gradually felt relieved.

469
00:33:50,119 --> 00:33:52,419
Although I don't know what will happen next,

470
00:33:52,419 --> 00:33:54,520
I'm not afraid of you anymore.

471
00:33:57,940 --> 00:34:00,879
Did I... say anything wrong?

472
00:34:02,859 --> 00:34:04,139
No.

473
00:34:04,139 --> 00:34:05,999
I'm just thinking...

474
00:34:05,999 --> 00:34:09,220
the Ye Shilan I knew at Taoyuan Village has come back.

475
00:34:09,220 --> 00:34:10,599
She knows to give and take,

476
00:34:10,600 --> 00:34:12,640
so you want me to let out my anger.

477
00:34:16,199 --> 00:34:19,559
You won't ask for anything tough from me.

478
00:34:19,559 --> 00:34:21,239
I can't say.

479
00:34:27,080 --> 00:34:29,719
Well, I should go since we have made it clear.

480
00:34:29,719 --> 00:34:32,378
- May I drive you home?
- No. I'm good.

481
00:34:33,120 --> 00:34:34,579
Ye Shilan.

482
00:34:35,199 --> 00:34:39,440
Don't you worry that you can't do the job of an assistant?

483
00:34:39,440 --> 00:34:40,880
I'm worried.

484
00:34:41,579 --> 00:34:45,779
But... I'll work hard and try my best.

485
00:34:45,779 --> 00:34:49,000
And I am a doctor, my major is nursing science,

486
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:52,980
so I have more advantages compared with others.

487
00:34:56,379 --> 00:34:59,120
Assistant Ye, I look forward to working with you.

488
00:35:00,579 --> 00:35:03,760
President Lu, nice working with you.

489
00:35:08,159 --> 00:35:10,579
The negotiation ended well.

490
00:35:13,059 --> 00:35:16,719
I told him what I thought, so he didn't push me anymore.

491
00:35:16,719 --> 00:35:19,479
Honey, you are a genius.

492
00:35:19,479 --> 00:35:20,878
Oh, my honey.

493
00:35:20,879 --> 00:35:22,619
Please don't compliment me.

494
00:35:22,700 --> 00:35:27,700
Trying to figure out a person's psychological and behavioral motives is the basic quality of a writer

495
00:35:28,700 --> 00:35:30,779
When can you finish working?

496
00:35:32,020 --> 00:35:33,720
In one hour.

497
00:35:33,720 --> 00:35:35,338
I'm off work tomorrow morning.

498
00:35:35,338 --> 00:35:38,699
Don't wake me up for breakfast for I have to write late tonight.

499
00:35:38,700 --> 00:35:40,199
Okay.

500
00:35:40,199 --> 00:35:41,979
Be careful on your way home.

501
00:35:41,979 --> 00:35:44,299

529
00:38:22,099 --> 00:38:23,718
Good morning, Dr. Ye.

530
00:38:23,719 --> 00:38:24,918
Morning, Assistant Lin.

531
00:38:24,919 --> 00:38:26,900
President told me you'll be his assistant for a while.

532
00:38:26,900 --> 00:38:28,500
So I came to help you.

533
00:38:28,500 --> 00:38:30,299
Sorry to trouble you.

534
00:38:30,299 --> 00:38:31,759
Here is your workplace.

535
00:38:31,760 --> 00:38:33,460
I've prepared your office supplies.

536
00:38:33,460 --> 00:38:36,199
If you need anything else, tell me directly.

537
00:38:37,560 --> 00:38:39,039
This is the key card for the president's office.

538
00:38:39,040 --> 00:38:40,300
Keep it.

539
00:38:40,300 --> 00:38:42,699
Okay. Thanks.

540
00:38:42,699 --> 00:38:43,940
It's early now.

541
00:38:43,940 --> 00:38:47,979
So you can relax for a moment, we'll talk in detail once the president arrives.

542
00:38:48,859 --> 00:38:52,739
Or... is there anything that I can do right now?

543
00:38:59,740 --> 00:39:02,099
It's clean and tidy.

544
00:39:43,520 --> 00:39:45,099
Morning, President.

545
00:39:45,740 --> 00:39:47,120
Morning.

546
00:39:51,660 --> 00:39:53,799
I didn't move anything on the desk.

547
00:39:53,800 --> 00:39:56,959
It's in the right order. I just made it tidier.

548
00:39:57,619 --> 00:39:59,900
It's good to have this awareness.

549
00:40:00,539 --> 00:40:04,199
But... the curtain should be half open.

550
00:40:04,199 --> 00:40:06,298
The brighter sunshine will affect my concentration,

551
00:40:06,298 --> 00:40:07,979
and it's bad for my eyes.

552
00:40:07,979 --> 00:40:10,118
Sure. Copy that.

553
00:40:12,579 --> 00:40:13,699
And...

554
00:40:13,699 --> 00:40:15,239
Did I overwater it?

555
00:40:15,239 --> 00:40:18,359
After watering it, don't forget to wipe the floor.

556
00:40:18,360 --> 00:40:21,080
No problem. I'll pay attention to it next time.

557
00:40:21,080 --> 00:40:24,599
It's inevitable to be negligent at the beginning of work. Don't be nervous.

558
00:40:26,879 --> 00:40:29,260
As a doctor, you must have a good memory. Right?

559
00:40:29,260 --> 00:40:31,720
After all, there are so many things to remember and memorize.

560
00:40:31,720 --> 00:40:34,120
It... It depends.

561
00:40:34,120 --> 00:40:35,640
What's wrong?

562
00:40:47,800 --> 00:40:53,100
Your job content is to take care of the dean's basic necessities of life and some auxiliary work.

563
00:40:53,179 --> 00:40:55,640
Here are two documents about your work.

564
00:40:55,640 --> 00:40:59,038
The first one includes Is the specific work items and related requirements.

565
00:40:59,038 --> 00:41:00,580
Please familiarize yourself as soon as possible.

566
00:41:00,580 --> 00:41:01,920
Okay.

567
00:41:02,940 --> 00:41:05,158
Sometimes, the president will sometimes have some requirements to change.

568
00:41:05,200 --> 00:41:08,200
You need to record the update so that later assistants can follow.

569
00:41:08,239 --> 00:41:09,579
Okay. Got it.

570
00:41:09,600 --> 00:41:13,700
The second one is the phone number of important contacts and the basic information of important customers.

571
00:41:13,760 --> 00:41:15,560
You'll need to memorize it all.

572
00:41:19,460 --> 00:41:21,259
When you accompany him to an event,

573
00:41:21,259 --> 00:41:25,199
if he can't recognize their faces, you should remind him.

574
00:41:25,199 --> 00:41:28,780
Can I save their numbers on my phone?

575
00:41:28,780 --> 00:41:32,180
You can't take the documents with you in case you lose them.

576
00:41:32,180 --> 00:41:33,839
You can save the contacts,

577
00:41:33,840 --> 00:41:37,199
but you need to memorize all of them in case of emergency.

578
00:41:37,199 --> 00:41:38,939
Is it really necessary?

579
00:41:38,939 --> 00:41:40,420
Yes, it is.

580
00:41:40,420 --> 00:41:43,778
If your phone has a low battery, or is forgotten, or is just broken,

581
00:41:43,778 --> 00:41:46,220
or for example, the president goes fishing suddenly

582
00:41:46,220 --> 00:41:48,420
but he's trapped for three days...

583
00:41:50,339 --> 00:41:52,679
It's just an example.

584
00:41:52,679 --> 00:41:54,920
Sure. Copy that.

585
00:41:54,920 --> 00:41:56,719
I'll memorize them all.

586
00:41:56,719 --> 00:42:00,000
One more thing, the assistant has no fixed shift time or weekly holidays.

587
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:02,720
But we can arrange your vacation according to different situations.

588
00:42:02,720 --> 00:42:04,339
Dr. Ye was a doctor,

589
00:42:04,339 --> 00:42:07,380
so you must be familiar with this working system.

590
00:42:07,380 --> 00:42:08,859
Yes.

591
00:42:08,859 --> 00:42:10,060
Well done.

592
00:42:10,060 --> 00:42:11,820
That's all you need to know.

593
00:42:11,820 --> 00:42:14,160
Just get used to it as soon as possible.

594
00:42:14,160 --> 00:42:17,620
From now on, you are Assistant Ye.

595
00:42:17,620 --> 00:42:20,800
Print two copies of the documents on this USB.

596
00:42:20,800 --> 00:42:22,999
I need a glass of warm water every morning.

597
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:25,100
Then a cup of coffee at 10:30.

598
00:42:25,100 --> 00:42:26,919
Which kind is it?

599
00:42:27,980 --> 00:42:29,379
Italian espresso.

600
00:42:29,379 --> 00:42:31,219
No sugar. With milk.

601
00:42:31,219 --> 00:42:32,939
Italian espresso.

602
00:42:32,939 --> 00:42:34,578
With milk. No sugar.

603
00:42:34,578 --> 00:42:36,020
Latte.
