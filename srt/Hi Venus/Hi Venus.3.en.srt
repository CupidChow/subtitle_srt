<i>[Hi Venus]</i>

15
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:30,352
<i>[Episode 03]</i>

16
00:01:55,940 --> 00:01:57,495
Sorry.

17
00:01:57,495 --> 00:01:59,948
My mom has to...

18
00:02:32,220 --> 00:02:35,399
Mom, this was shot the other day.

19
00:02:35,399 --> 00:02:37,019
He was worn out after work.

20
00:02:37,019 --> 00:02:39,819
I took this picture when he was resting.

21
00:02:44,780 --> 00:02:47,660
<i>He looks nice. He matches you well.</i>

22
00:02:47,660 --> 00:02:49,935
<i>I'm so relieved.</i>

23
00:02:53,179 --> 00:02:55,439
Being good-looking doesn't mean anything.

24
00:02:55,439 --> 00:02:59,320
He's nothing but a medicinal seller loving to talk nonsense and wheedle others.

25
00:03:02,579 --> 00:03:04,131
Don't sleep here.

26
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:45,519
<i>Lan, do you like the little sheep?</i>

27
00:03:45,519 --> 00:03:46,620
<i>Yes, I do.</i>

28
00:03:46,620 --> 00:03:50,571
<i>Next time, let's buy that bigger one home as well, shall we?</i>

29
00:03:53,479 --> 00:03:55,659
<i>Mom said our home was too small and crowded,</i>

30
00:03:55,659 --> 00:03:57,739
<i>and we shouldn't buy those useless things.</i>

31
00:03:57,739 --> 00:04:01,603
<i>Besides, moving them would also be troublesome.</i>

32
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:06,700
<i>Daddy will work hard to make more money.</i>

33
00:04:06,700 --> 00:04:10,388
<i>Next year, we will buy a house of our own.</i>

34
00:04:10,388 --> 00:04:12,260
<i>And you will have your own room.</i>

35
00:04:12,260 --> 00:04:14,740
<i>It will be beautifully decorated,</i>

36
00:04:14,740 --> 00:04:17,279
<i>and will be big enough to fit anything we buy.</i>

37
00:04:18,520 --> 00:04:20,020
<i>Really?</i>

38
00:04:20,020 --> 00:04:23,599
<i>Of course! When has Daddy ever bragged?</i>

39
00:04:24,299 --> 00:04:25,399
<i>Then pinky swear?</i>

40
00:04:25,399 --> 00:04:26,899
<i>No problem.</i>

41
00:04:26,899 --> 00:04:30,939
<i>Pinky swear. A deal is a deal.</i>

42
00:04:30,939 --> 00:04:31,820
<i>I promise.</i>

43
00:04:31,820 --> 00:04:35,020
<i>Come on. Let's go.</i>

44
00:05:47,019 --> 00:05:48,040
Good morning, Deputy Director.

45
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:49,543
Morning.

46
00:05:49,543 --> 00:05:53,259
Ye left some breakfast for you. It's in the steamer.

47
00:05:55,299 --> 00:05:58,551
Did you drink medicinal wine covertly last night?

48
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:02,720
Ye has made you some soup to sober you up.

49
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:39,780
How about this?

50
00:06:39,780 --> 00:06:43,179
This time, we should give a bad work review to Ye,

51
00:06:43,179 --> 00:06:45,699
saying that she is not suitable to work here.

52
00:06:45,699 --> 00:06:48,744
So that Anxing Hospital can transfer her back.

53
00:06:48,744 --> 00:06:51,408
You don't get it, Director.

54
00:06:51,408 --> 00:06:53,440
We all think Ye's performance is poor.

55
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:56,321
But why did Anxing Hospital still hire her even if she is not a good doctor? Right?

56
00:06:56,321 --> 00:06:59,920
That makes sense. Then, what shall we do?

57
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:03,299
As far as I'm concerned, how about we make a pile of pennants for her

58
00:07:03,299 --> 00:07:06,360
on behalf of the villagers, and send them to Anxing Hospital?

59
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:10,012
It can put pressure on Chief Huang.

60
00:07:10,012 --> 00:07:11,700
Good idea!

61
00:07:11,700 --> 00:07:13,170
You're so smart.

62
00:07:13,170 --> 00:07:15,292
Don't worry about me.

63
00:07:17,259 --> 00:07:19,620
I mean, if you send those pennants to Anxing hospital,

64
00:07:19,620 --> 00:07:21,299
Then I have to die of embarrassment.

65
00:07:21,299 --> 00:07:23,019
There's nothing to be embarrassed about.

66
00:07:23,019 --> 00:07:25,359
You have always come to the village early in the morning

67
00:07:25,359 --> 00:07:27,299
taking blood pressure and delivering medicine.

68
00:07:27,299 --> 00:07:29,579
To be honest, you are doing a lot of work. Right?

69
00:07:29,579 --> 00:07:32,979
It's all I should do. Nothing to boast about.

70
00:07:34,199 --> 00:07:36,720
By the way, I have good news.

71
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:38,099
The road in the village is now open.

72
00:07:38,099 --> 00:07:40,060
We already know.

73
00:07:40,060 --> 00:07:41,560
How did you know?

74
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:43,299
Did the villagers come to the clinic this morning?

75
00:07:43,299 --> 00:07:46,201
Nope. Lu left.

76
00:07:47,459 --> 00:07:49,647
Lu Zhaoxi left?

77
00:07:49,647 --> 00:07:51,620
The network is connected and the road is open now.

78
00:07:51,620 --> 00:07:53,260
Of course, he would leave.

79
00:07:53,260 --> 00:07:54,459
So what?

80
00:07:54,459 --> 00:07:57,159
Did you want to keep him for lunch?

81
00:07:58,379 --> 00:08:00,140
He should have said goodbye to me.

82
00:08:00,140 --> 00:08:03,583
You don't want him to go, do you?

83
00:08:04,820 --> 00:08:08,019
I don't care. It's none of my business.

84
00:08:08,019 --> 00:08:09,920
It's good that he left.

85
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:13,000
Better never see him again!

86
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:18,119
I didn't go to the induction meeting. It should have been very interesting.

87
00:10:18,119 --> 00:10:21,380
It was. I thought you were absent on purpose.

88
00:10:21,380 --> 00:10:23,499
Although I didn't want to go, at meetings like this,

89
00:10:23,499 --> 00:10:26,692
I'll have to deal with those senior executives sooner or later.

90
00:10:26,692 --> 00:10:29,359
From your perspective, what do they think of me now?

91
00:10:29,359 --> 00:10:32,239
A millionaire brat? A titular hospital president?

92
00:10:33,740 --> 00:10:35,819
When shall we arrange such a meeting again?

93
00:10:35,819 --> 00:10:37,599
The sooner, the better.

94
00:10:37,599 --> 00:10:40,239
But Dean Xu and Chief Qin are out of town.

95
00:10:40,239 --> 00:10:42,859
The soonest we can do is next Monday.

96
00:10:43,900 --> 00:10:47,180
Okay. Next week will do.

97
00:10:47,180 --> 00:10:50,239
Do we need to push ahead with the collaboration on filming the documentary?

98
00:10:50,239 --> 00:10:52,640
I have read the proposal. There is no problem.

99
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:54,420
But I need time to reconsider it.

100
00:10:54,420 --> 00:10:56,680
Sure. If you need additional information,

101
00:10:56,680 --> 00:10:58,512
I'll ask them for it.

102
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:03,400
By the way, if you're available please look up a doctor's profile for me.

103
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:06,379
Are you giving them an offer or just for collaboration?

104
00:11:06,379 --> 00:11:09,639
To be exact, I need to get even with them.

105
00:11:09,639 --> 00:11:13,370
This person is a doctor at our hospital, called Ye Shilan.

106
00:11:13,370 --> 00:11:16,340
<i>[Anxing Hospital]</i>

107
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:19,080
Good morning, President.

108
00:11:20,359 --> 00:11:21,520
Do they know me?

109
00:11:21,520 --> 00:11:22,860
Your appointment hasn't been officially announced,

110
00:11:22,860 --> 00:11:24,799
but the doctors must have talked about it in private.

111
00:11:24,799 --> 00:11:26,379
I guess they all know it.

112
00:11:26,379 --> 00:11:28,559
That's not necessarily true.

113
00:11:28,559 --> 00:11:32,684
Shall we update the official website, and send an email to everyone?

114
00:11:32,684 --> 00:11:34,060
No rush.

115
00:11:34,060 --> 00:11:35,519
Okay.

116
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:47,931
<i>Chief Huang's nickname is Horse Leg Pioneer.</i>

117
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:53,800
<i>He likes to cater to Dean Xu the most and follow his lead.</i>

118
00:11:53,840 --> 00:11:55,440
Chief Huang.

119
00:11:56,359 --> 00:11:59,919
It's my pleasure to meet you. I'm Lu Zhaoxi.

120
00:11:59,919 --> 00:12:01,672
President Lu.

121
00:12:01,672 --> 00:12:03,540
I've been looking forward to seeing you.

122
00:12:03,540 --> 00:12:05,080
Hope we can get along well with each other.

123
00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:07,440
Oh, you don't have to be so polite.

124
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:10,240
- You get to work first.
- Okay, then I'll get busy.

125
00:12:18,379 --> 00:12:20,812
Goodbye, President Lu.

126
00:12:27,359 --> 00:12:29,552
What a brat.

127
00:12:31,479 --> 00:12:33,520
Horse Leg Pioneer.

128
00:12:34,267 --> 00:12:36,339
What?

129
00:12:37,039 --> 00:12:38,639
I didn't say anything.

130
00:13:11,939 --> 00:13:13,039
President Gao.

131
00:13:13,039 --> 00:13:14,740
I heard from Assistant Lin that you were back,

132
00:13:14,740 --> 00:13:17,080
so I come to see you at once.

133
00:13:17,080 --> 00:13:18,699
Please have a seat.

134
00:13:20,059 --> 00:13:21,040
Would you like some tea?

135
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:22,579
No, thanks.

136
00:13:22,579 --> 00:13:24,960
I just had some. Thank you.

137
00:13:26,039 --> 00:13:27,819
Actually, I should be the one to visit you.

138
00:13:27,819 --> 00:13:29,320
I was fully occupied by my work these days,

139
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:30,599
so I couldn't find a proper time.

140
00:13:30,599 --> 00:13:33,399
I get it. Don't see me as a stranger.

141
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:35,964
Oh, here.

142
00:13:35,964 --> 00:13:37,960
I brought you a box of tea leaves.

143
00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:40,439
They taste pretty good. Give them a try.

144
00:13:40,439 --> 00:13:43,684
I brought this Wuyi Rock tea from Wuyi Mountain for you.

145
00:13:43,684 --> 00:13:45,740
Only good water matches fine tea like this.

146
00:13:45,740 --> 00:13:50,099
It's just right to make the tea with the spring water of Wuyi Mountain.

147
00:13:50,100 --> 00:13:51,540
I am not very good at tea tasting.

148
00:13:51,540 --> 00:13:54,180
But if you recommend it, it must be of good quality.

149
00:13:54,180 --> 00:13:55,440
Then I won't be polite.

150
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:56,940
Oh, here's another thing.

151
00:13:58,259 --> 00:14:02,240
- What's this?
- The assistant of the former president is taking maternity leave.

152
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:04,359
In this way, you'll have to find another assistant

153
00:14:04,359 --> 00:14:06,379
who can do the odd jobs for you.

154
00:14:06,379 --> 00:14:09,740
And the personnel office happened to send a pile of resumes to me.

155
00:14:09,740 --> 00:14:13,244
I interviewed them myself and selected three from them.

156
00:14:13,244 --> 00:14:14,999
You can choose one.

157
00:14:17,139 --> 00:14:21,123
You don't have to manage these trifles on your own.

158
00:14:21,123 --> 00:14:22,891
This is not a trifle.

159
00:14:22,891 --> 00:14:24,320
Only when you're free from troubles in life

160
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:26,760
can you focus on your work better.

161
00:14:26,760 --> 00:14:28,280
You're right.

162
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:33,639
I heard from the purchasing manager that you bought the obsolete B-ultrasound machine

163
00:14:33,639 --> 00:14:37,527
and a batch of medicines in your own name.

164
00:14:37,527 --> 00:14:41,451
I wonder what this was for?

165
00:14:45,100 --> 00:14:48,440
I didn't expect him to report this to you.

166
00:14:48,440 --> 00:14:49,660
Anyway, it's his duty.

167
00:14:49,660 --> 00:14:53,420
These years, you have been in charge of all hospital purchases.

168
00:14:53,420 --> 00:14:57,356
I just wanted to quietly make a small donation to the small mountain village clinic for charity.

169
00:14:57,356 --> 00:14:59,660
Philanthropy?

170
00:14:59,660 --> 00:15:01,459
You should have told me about this earlier.

171
00:15:01,459 --> 00:15:03,220
I'm familiar with that pharmaceutical company.

172
00:15:03,220 --> 00:15:06,919
If I talk to them, I promise I'll get the best price.

173
00:15:06,919 --> 00:15:09,180
Great. Thank you for helping me.

174
00:15:09,180 --> 00:15:10,879
Don't mention it.

175
00:15:12,440 --> 00:15:16,424
Years ago, when I was working for your dad,

176
00:15:16,424 --> 00:15:18,500
Former President Lu always said

177
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:21,379
when a company has made money, it should do more charity,

178
00:15:21,379 --> 00:15:23,340
giving back more to the community.

179
00:15:23,340 --> 00:15:26,148
You resemble your father at this point.

180
00:15:26,148 --> 00:15:27,900
I'm still far behind compared to my father.

181
00:15:27,900 --> 00:15:29,720
I need to work harder.

182
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:30,719
All right.

183
00:15:30,719 --> 00:15:33,868
I could say much more, but I'd better let you go.

184
00:15:34,939 --> 00:15:38,239
President Gao, I appreciate your gift.

185
00:15:38,239 --> 00:15:41,182
If you want more, just tell me.

186
00:15:54,440 --> 00:15:58,579
Madam, you need to take this pill three times a day, one pill at a time.

187
00:15:58,579 --> 00:16:01,823
And this one. You need to take it twice a day, one bag at a time.

188
00:16:01,823 --> 00:16:03,820
I can't remember.

189
00:16:03,820 --> 00:16:05,979
It's all written here.

190
00:16:07,359 --> 00:16:09,636
But I can't read.

191
00:16:11,220 --> 00:16:13,200
Oh, no worries.

192
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:15,320
Let me divide them for you according to the amount of each dose.

193
00:16:15,320 --> 00:16:17,639
- Thank you.
- Don't mention it.

194
00:16:22,860 --> 00:16:24,711
Hello?

195
00:16:26,059 --> 00:16:27,119
No, I'm not.

196
00:16:27,119 --> 00:16:28,420
Please wait a second.

197
00:16:28,420 --> 00:16:30,120
Ye!

198
00:16:30,799 --> 00:16:32,499
Ye!

199
00:16:32,499 --> 00:16:34,299
<i>I'm coming.</i>

200
00:16:34,299 --> 00:16:35,959
Your call.

201
00:16:40,119 --> 00:16:42,467
Yes. Hello?

202
00:16:42,467 --> 00:16:44,176
Yes, it's me.

203
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:46,640
I'm in the clinic.

204
00:16:49,379 --> 00:16:51,539
Please deliver them to me.

205
00:16:51,539 --> 00:16:53,363
Okay, bye.

206
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,700
What's wrong?

207
00:16:56,700 --> 00:16:59,548
They said I have a truckload of goods to be delivered.

208
00:16:59,940 --> 00:17:04,020
<i>[Taoyuan Village Clinic]</i>

209
00:17:07,940 --> 00:17:10,339
Lu is really trustworthy.

210
00:17:10,339 --> 00:17:12,400
Look at this ultrasound machine.

211
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:14,520
This is what we desperately need.

212
00:17:14,520 --> 00:17:17,000
We really misunderstood him before.

213
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:20,580
This Granny Fang's eyes are really bad.

214
00:17:20,580 --> 00:17:24,759
How could she mistake Lu for a seller of medicinal wine?

215
00:17:24,759 --> 00:17:26,119
It's my fault.

216
00:17:26,119 --> 00:17:27,560
It was my preconception.

217
00:17:27,560 --> 00:17:30,019
Director, is it possible

218
00:17:30,019 --> 00:17:32,359
that Lu is truly the president of Anxing Hospital?

219
00:17:32,359 --> 00:17:34,640
But I just checked the official website of the hospital.

220
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:36,900
The president is still the original one.

221
00:17:36,900 --> 00:17:40,072
I guess Lu is a rich second generation.

222
00:17:40,072 --> 00:17:42,860
Whatever. Maybe he made up an identity to cover himself.

223
00:17:42,860 --> 00:17:45,499
Rich people have a lot of worries.

224
00:17:45,499 --> 00:17:48,084
I get it.

225
00:17:48,084 --> 00:17:50,143
These are nice.

226
00:17:54,439 --> 00:17:59,052
Ye, do you regret that you didn't get Lu's phone number,

227
00:17:59,052 --> 00:18:01,099
and missed the little golden turtle?

228
00:18:01,099 --> 00:18:03,319
I do regret that I misjudged him.

229
00:18:03,319 --> 00:18:06,460
What's this little golden turtle and the little silver turtle?

230
00:18:06,460 --> 00:18:07,700
Okay, okay.

231
00:18:07,700 --> 00:18:08,760
Ye definitely has a backbone.

232
00:18:08,760 --> 00:18:13,116
Such a self-reliant, thrifty, and self-made girl.

233
00:18:13,116 --> 00:18:16,239
Did you get any feedback after you submitted the work review

234
00:18:16,239 --> 00:18:17,544
I asked you about?

235
00:18:17,544 --> 00:18:20,820
How can you ask when you already know?

236
00:18:35,680 --> 00:18:37,720
I'm being recalled to the hospital.

237
00:18:39,239 --> 00:18:41,979
- Director, I can return to Anxing Hospital!
- Really?

238
00:18:41,979 --> 00:18:43,520
Really! They transferred me back to the hospital!

239
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:45,501
It's true! Look!

240
00:18:45,501 --> 00:18:48,000
Back to the Pediatric Department of Anxing Hospital.

241
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,599
That's great!

242
00:18:49,599 --> 00:18:51,199
I can finally go back!

243
00:18:51,199 --> 00:18:52,991
Good for you!

244
00:18:55,060 --> 00:18:56,360
Come in.

245
00:18:57,219 --> 00:18:59,420
President, according to your instructions,

246
00:18:59,420 --> 00:19:01,540
the interview merely went through the motions.

247
00:19:01,540 --> 00:19:03,188
I did a survey.

248
00:19:03,188 --> 00:19:06,139
I found that one of the three candidates is a young distant relative of President Gao.

249
00:19:06,139 --> 00:19:09,079
As for the other two, I didn't see any connection.

250
00:19:09,079 --> 00:19:10,940
Perhaps they want me to choose my assistant first

251
00:19:10,940 --> 00:19:12,859
so they can figure out a way to hire them afterward.

252
00:19:12,859 --> 00:19:15,459
Arranging an informer around you in such a hurry

253
00:19:15,459 --> 00:19:17,440
shows that they must have a guilty conscience.

254
00:19:18,239 --> 00:19:20,047
Who knows?

255
00:19:21,019 --> 00:19:23,239
But anyway, I do need an assistant.

256
00:19:23,239 --> 00:19:25,379
Shall I look for one for you?

257
00:19:25,379 --> 00:19:26,779
No, thanks.

258
00:19:27,599 --> 00:19:30,029
Here is what you asked for, the profile of Ye Shilan.

259
00:19:32,540 --> 00:19:34,739
She's been at Anxing Hospital for a year and a half.

260
00:19:34,739 --> 00:19:38,560
More than half a year ago, she volunteered to go to Taoyuan Village, offering medical assistance.

261
00:19:38,560 --> 00:19:41,359
Before she left, she came to President Gao for a patient,

262
00:19:41,359 --> 00:19:44,639
letting Dean Xu do a surgery that was almost impossible to succeed.

263
00:19:44,639 --> 00:19:46,680
Although Ye Shilan's assistance period has long passed

264
00:19:46,680 --> 00:19:49,332
and her examination results have always been good,

265
00:19:49,332 --> 00:19:51,900
but Chief Huang did not transfer her back from the village

266
00:19:51,900 --> 00:19:53,830
on the grounds that the department was full.

267
00:19:55,119 --> 00:19:58,300
Why do you think President Gao was so enthusiastic about it at that time?

268
00:19:58,300 --> 00:19:59,859
President Gao is not a doctor.

269
00:19:59,900 --> 00:20:01,800
He was promoted from the Administration Department.

270
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:04,600
However, Dean Xu is a pure doctor with exceptional medical skills.

271
00:20:04,619 --> 00:20:08,547
The higher his reputation, the greater the threat to President Gao.

272
00:20:12,139 --> 00:20:16,144
This Ye Shilan was manipulated and is still being kept in the dark.

273
00:20:17,859 --> 00:20:20,199
When you were trapped at the clinic in Taoyuan Village,

274
00:20:20,199 --> 00:20:22,319
did anything happen between you and Ye Shilan?

275
00:20:22,319 --> 00:20:23,560
What do you mean?

276
00:20:23,560 --> 00:20:24,960
Marriage.

277
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:28,532
You have a dangerous mind.

278
00:20:28,532 --> 00:20:31,616
No marriage but there were a lot of conflicts.

279
00:20:31,616 --> 00:20:32,820
That's good.

280
00:20:32,820 --> 00:20:35,540
Actually, I've heard about another version of the gossip.

281
00:20:35,540 --> 00:20:37,019
Tell me more about it.

282
00:20:37,019 --> 00:20:39,280
It's said that Ye Shilan had a crush on a doctor named Jiang Huaiming

283
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:41,440
who was also in their department.

284
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:43,180
They were classmates.

285
00:20:43,180 --> 00:20:44,400
Because her confession was unsuccessful,

286
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:46,979
she took the initiative by applying to the hospital to go to Taoyuan Village.

287
00:20:46,979 --> 00:20:50,740
One was to avoid embarrassment and the other was to treat emotional injuries.

288
00:20:52,979 --> 00:20:55,640
I guess you're not interested in it. I'm done with my report.

289
00:20:55,640 --> 00:20:57,440
I'll leave first.

290
00:20:57,440 --> 00:20:59,379
Who says I'm not interested?

291
00:21:00,440 --> 00:21:03,360
Let's go. To take a look.

292
00:21:05,300 --> 00:21:07,119
Honey, don't cry.

293
00:21:07,119 --> 00:21:08,280
Don't be afraid.

294
00:21:08,280 --> 00:21:09,359
It's just an examination.

295
00:21:09,359 --> 00:21:12,039
Kid, don't be afraid.

296
00:21:12,039 --> 00:21:14,540
We are just using it on your belly to find out

297
00:21:14,540 --> 00:21:16,101
whether there are any elves in there.

298
00:21:16,101 --> 00:21:19,859
Liar. There won't be any elves in my belly.

299
00:21:19,859 --> 00:21:21,903
No elves?

300
00:21:23,219 --> 00:21:26,319
Then if there are not any elves, there must be a little monster.

301
00:21:26,319 --> 00:21:29,539
Otherwise, why does your belly hurt? Right?

302
00:21:30,139 --> 00:21:31,680
Don't cry.

303
00:21:32,479 --> 00:21:36,099
Let me show you something that is really interesting.

304
00:21:36,099 --> 00:21:38,247
Look at this.

305
00:21:40,780 --> 00:21:42,941
How about this? You hear it yourself.

306
00:21:42,941 --> 00:21:45,420
If there is a little monster in your belly, just tell Monkey King,

307
00:21:45,420 --> 00:21:46,900
so that he can fight the monster off.

308
00:21:46,900 --> 00:21:48,500
Okay?

309
00:21:48,500 --> 00:21:49,719
Here.

310
00:21:49,719 --> 00:21:51,219
Let's listen.

311
00:21:51,219 --> 00:21:54,299
Listen to the sound of that little monster.

312
00:21:54,299 --> 00:21:56,832
Good boy.

313
00:21:58,339 --> 00:22:00,460
I hear nothing.

314
00:22:00,460 --> 00:22:02,139
Nothing?

315
00:22:02,139 --> 00:22:03,439
How about this?

316
00:22:03,439 --> 00:22:05,779
Let me hear it for you, okay?

317
00:22:11,040 --> 00:22:12,340
<i>This.</i>

318
00:22:12,340 --> 00:22:13,780
<i>Where did you get it?</i>

319
00:22:13,780 --> 00:22:15,580
<i>It just fell from the pillowcase.</i>

320
00:22:15,580 --> 00:22:18,499
<i>All the things in this room are my personal belongings.</i>

321
00:22:18,499 --> 00:22:20,479
<i>You are not allowed to touch anything.</i>

322
00:22:23,660 --> 00:22:26,360
Sure enough, it's to treat emotional injuries.

323
00:22:26,360 --> 00:22:28,123
Let's go grab some food.

324

It sure is a great meal.

327
00:23:24,155 --> 00:23:26,187
What day is it today?

328
00:23:26,187 --> 00:23:28,652
Ye will leave in the afternoon.

329
00:23:28,652 --> 00:23:30,400
Leave this afternoon?

330
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:31,640
I told you the other day.

331
00:23:31,640 --> 00:23:32,979
Look at your memory.

332
00:23:32,979 --> 00:23:34,359
What now?

333
00:23:34,359 --> 00:23:36,239
Don't want me to leave?

334
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:38,500
We're willing.

335
00:23:39,880 --> 00:23:41,972
We're willing.

336
00:23:41,972 --> 00:23:45,119
There is no future to stay here with us.

337
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:47,359
I will come back to visit you often.

338
00:23:47,359 --> 00:23:50,239
Sure. Don't forget to bring goodies!

339
00:23:50,239 --> 00:23:51,739
All you know is to eat.

340
00:23:51,739 --> 00:23:53,180
You have the three highs.
<i>(Hypertension, hyperglycemia, and hyperlipidemia)</i>

341
00:23:53,180 --> 00:23:55,280
You should restrain your diet.

342
00:23:56,780 --> 00:23:59,760
By the way, I left a notebook on my desk.

343
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:02,359
When the new doctor arrives, remember to give it to him.

344
00:24:02,359 --> 00:24:04,920
I took down what you both need to watch out for in your diet,

345
00:24:04,920 --> 00:24:08,000
and the medical treatments of several other chronic patients.

346
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:09,880
I also drew a small map.

347
00:24:09,880 --> 00:24:13,280
When I first came to this village, I felt the roads were all the same.

348
00:24:13,280 --> 00:24:16,419
- Ye, how about staying here?
- Why?

349
00:24:16,500 --> 00:24:20,300
You have so many concerns as if the clinic would be shut down without you.

350
00:24:20,359 --> 00:24:23,800
You know what, before you came, Director and I cooked our own meals.

351
00:24:23,800 --> 00:24:25,200
Right, Director?

352
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:27,940
Your cooking is also delicious.

353
00:24:31,119 --> 00:24:33,920
So, when you go back, you should focus on your work.

354
00:24:33,920 --> 00:24:35,719
Don't waste energy on everything.

355
00:24:35,719 --> 00:24:38,979
Make some achievements to prove yourself.

356
00:24:38,979 --> 00:24:40,540
What's more...

357
00:24:42,959 --> 00:24:45,839
When you encounter difficulties, think twice before acting.

358
00:24:45,839 --> 00:24:46,959
Don't be impulsive.

359
00:24:46,959 --> 00:24:49,441
Next is your temper. You need to control it.

360
00:24:49,441 --> 00:24:52,140
Don't offend your superiors again.

361
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:55,120
I see.

362
00:24:56,040 --> 00:24:57,139
Here.

363
00:24:57,139 --> 00:24:59,839
I did not chop off the chicken legs today on purpose.

364
00:24:59,839 --> 00:25:01,640
One chicken leg per person.

365
00:25:01,640 --> 00:25:02,840
Here.

366
00:25:05,079 --> 00:25:08,880
In the old days, only children would be rewarded with chicken legs.

367
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:11,079
That's because we were poor back then.

368
00:25:11,079 --> 00:25:12,579
Aren't you going to eat?

369
00:25:13,959 --> 00:25:15,139
I eat chicken wings.

370
00:25:15,139 --> 00:25:17,571
I'll fly higher and higher.

371
00:26:06,580 --> 00:26:08,180
I need to go.

372
00:26:10,119 --> 00:26:11,619
Okay.

373
00:27:10,060 --> 00:27:12,540
It's getting more and more quiet.

374
00:27:45,560 --> 00:27:47,983
<i>Wake up. Time to work.</i>

375
00:27:49,319 --> 00:27:52,319
<i>Lu, the medicinal winemaker, get up and go to work.</i>

376
00:27:54,979 --> 00:27:56,679
Did you have a nightmare?

377
00:27:59,400 --> 00:28:00,900
Nope.

378
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:05,932
<i>Why did I dream of her?</i>

379
00:28:26,739 --> 00:28:28,788
Yezi!

380
00:28:31,560 --> 00:28:33,463
Jiajia!

381
00:28:33,463 --> 00:28:35,980
You finally came back!

382
00:28:35,980 --> 00:28:37,400
Let me see.

383
00:28:37,400 --> 00:28:39,040
You've lost a lot of weight!

384
00:28:39,040 --> 00:28:40,480
Let me carry it for you.

385
00:28:43,180 --> 00:28:44,780
Slow down.

386
00:28:48,820 --> 00:28:50,700
Come on. Let's go home.

387
00:28:53,920 --> 00:28:55,359
At first, you said to go there for three months.

388
00:28:55,359 --> 00:28:57,979
But countless three months have passed, and you never came back.

389
00:28:57,979 --> 00:29:00,001
I had to live alone. It almost made me depressed.

390
00:29:00,001 --> 00:29:02,499
I didn't expect this either.

391
00:29:02,499 --> 00:29:05,019
It's all the fault of Chief Huang.

392
00:29:11,479 --> 00:29:13,160
It's a little bit messy.

393
00:29:13,160 --> 00:29:15,259
I stayed up late to catch up with the draft, so it became messy.

394
00:29:15,259 --> 00:29:17,759
I also did the cleaning when I was free.

395
00:29:24,339 --> 00:29:26,039
It feels great.

396
00:29:29,180 --> 00:29:31,568
It's good to come home!

397
00:29:36,239 --> 00:29:38,259
Welcome back, Dr. Ye.

398
00:29:38,259 --> 00:29:41,351
Thank you, Writer Yao.

399
00:29:42,940 --> 00:29:45,940
Don't call me a writer. Call me coffee lady.

400
00:29:45,940 --> 00:29:47,039
Haven't they discovered you're a writer yet?

401
00:29:47,039 --> 00:29:49,019
It can't be known by others too easily!

402
00:29:49,019 --> 00:29:51,681
If my colleagues knew that I was writing

403
00:29:51,681 --> 00:29:53,379
the love story of a CEO and his lovely wife at night,

404
00:29:53,379 --> 00:29:55,460
they would laugh at me behind my back.

405
00:29:55,460 --> 00:29:58,060
Then, why not be a full-time writer?

406
00:29:58,060 --> 00:30:00,660
I'm just a nobody. I'm not qualified to be a full-time writer.

407
00:30:00,660 --> 00:30:04,319
Besides, working in the cafe is an important source of my inspiration.

408
00:30:04,319 --> 00:30:06,835
By the way, last time you told me

409
00:30:06,835 --> 00:30:10,851
that you'd been assigned to work at the branch near Anxing Hospital.

410
00:30:10,851 --> 00:30:13,619
I hope to find new inspirations in a different environment.

411
00:30:13,619 --> 00:30:15,460
I was stuck in my writing for a while.

412
00:30:15,460 --> 00:30:17,959
I always felt like the villain was way too normal.

413
00:30:17,959 --> 00:30:19,499
I want to create some sense of contrast in him.

414
00:30:19,499 --> 00:30:21,680
However, although I really struggled to do it, I just couldn't think of a proper one.

415
00:30:21,680 --> 00:30:26,720
And one day, a young male customer in a suit walked into our cafe,

416
00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:28,940
taking a thermos out of his bag,

417
00:30:28,940 --> 00:30:32,259
and said "Hello, I would like a pink strawberry milkshake.

418
00:30:32,259 --> 00:30:34,199
Takeout, please."

419
00:30:35,499 --> 00:30:37,219
I was stimulated at that time.

420
00:30:37,219 --> 00:30:40,800
Such a girlish hobby can't be more suitable for my villain.

421
00:30:40,800 --> 00:30:43,936
So I made up my mind to write about him in this way.

422
00:30:43,936 --> 00:30:46,048
I feel so sorry for him.

423
00:30:46,048 --> 00:30:48,828
That's his pleasure.

424
00:30:49,539 --> 00:30:53,099
By the way, last time you said that the fake hospital president

425
00:30:53,099 --> 00:30:55,603
was later confirmed to be a rich second-generation baby.

426
00:30:55,603 --> 00:30:57,819
Please tell me more about it later!

427
00:30:57,819 --> 00:31:00,460
Didn't I tell you on the phone?

428
00:31:00,460 --> 00:31:02,180
I want details!

429
00:31:02,180 --> 00:31:03,880
No.

430
00:31:03,880 --> 00:31:06,300
You'll definitely make it up in your novel.

431
00:31:06,300 --> 00:31:07,460
I don't need such an honor.

432
00:31:07,460 --> 00:31:08,940
I'm not making it up.

433
00:31:08,940 --> 00:31:11,784
I'm just doing some artistic processing.

434
00:31:11,784 --> 00:31:16,047
A prince in distress met a sassy wild girl.

435
00:31:16,047 --> 00:31:17,300
What a story.

436
00:31:17,300 --> 00:31:20,639
Screw you. You're that sassy wild girl.

437
00:31:20,639 --> 00:31:24,119
Congratulations again for coming back to Anxing Hospital.

438
00:31:24,119 --> 00:31:25,919
Tomorrow is a brand new day.

439
00:31:25,919 --> 00:31:28,115

00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:47,220
Perhaps I can make an ad to look for a partner.

487
00:34:47,220 --> 00:34:49,656
Why are you in a hurry, Dr. Li?

488
00:34:49,656 --> 00:34:50,940
I'm not in a hurry.

489
00:34:50,940 --> 00:34:53,500
The key to this is that my mother constantly reminds me.

490
00:34:53,500 --> 00:34:55,630
People like you with girlfriends

491
00:34:55,630 --> 00:34:57,579
can't understand the pain of single dogs like us.

492
00:35:01,220 --> 00:35:03,820
Dr. Ye, you're back.

493
00:35:03,820 --> 00:35:05,759
I'm back.

494
00:35:05,759 --> 00:35:07,479
You don't have a shift today?

495
00:35:07,479 --> 00:35:09,739
My shift is tomorrow.

496
00:35:09,739 --> 00:35:11,753
My shift is this afternoon.

497
00:35:17,059 --> 00:35:18,260
I'm sorry.

498
00:35:18,260 --> 00:35:20,439
I didn't know you were returning, so I haven't cleaned it up.

499
00:35:20,439 --> 00:35:21,940
No worries. I'll do it myself.

500
00:35:21,940 --> 00:35:24,120
It's okay. I'm leaving now.

501
00:35:38,859 --> 00:35:41,160
Hello, this is the Pediatric Department of Anxing Hospital.

502
00:35:41,160 --> 00:35:42,819
<i>Is Dr. Ye Shilan there?</i>

503
00:35:42,819 --> 00:35:43,859
This is Ye Shilan.

504
00:35:43,859 --> 00:35:46,833
<i>Please come to the new president's office.</i>

505
00:35:47,840 --> 00:35:49,440
Okay.

506
00:35:55,080 --> 00:35:57,656
<i>The new president's office?</i>

507
00:35:57,656 --> 00:36:00,988
<i>Is it true that we have a new president?</i>

508
00:36:01,519 --> 00:36:06,059
<i>Fine. I didn't think I need to tell you, a stranger, about this issue.</i>

509
00:36:06,059 --> 00:36:07,799
<i>But I'm telling you now.</i>

510
00:36:07,799 --> 00:36:11,320
<i>I'm the president of Anxing Hospital.</i>

511
00:36:11,320 --> 00:36:14,220
<i>How come the official website is not updated?</i>

512
00:36:14,220 --> 00:36:16,548
<i>It can't be true, right?</i>

513
00:36:21,199 --> 00:36:25,032
<i>Maybe, 'Xin' is the last name of our new president?</i>

514
00:36:25,032 --> 00:36:27,324
<i>President Xin.</i>

515
00:36:53,159 --> 00:36:54,859
<i>Come in.</i>

516
00:37:01,679 --> 00:37:04,691
President... Xin...

517
00:37:04,691 --> 00:37:06,579
I'm Dr. Ye Shilan, a pediatrician.

518
00:37:06,579 --> 00:37:08,740
The Personnel Department told me to come here.

519
00:37:08,740 --> 00:37:10,460
Please be seated.

520
00:37:19,980 --> 00:37:22,871
I heard someone pretended to be the new president in Taoyuan Village.

521
00:37:22,871 --> 00:37:24,299
How did you know that?

522
00:37:24,299 --> 00:37:26,479
Did you know it or not?

523
00:37:26,479 --> 00:37:28,200
Yes, I did.

524
00:37:28,200 --> 00:37:30,220
And I was the one who exposed his lies.

525
00:37:30,220 --> 00:37:32,020
Good job.

526
00:37:32,020 --> 00:37:33,944
Thanks.

527
00:37:33,944 --> 00:37:35,579
We're ready, President.

528
00:37:35,579 --> 00:37:37,539
Remember to attend the meeting later.

529
00:37:37,539 --> 00:37:39,139
Okay.

530
00:37:43,919 --> 00:37:46,699
Hello, Dr. Ye.

531
00:38:25,560 --> 00:38:29,427
You just did that on purpose, right?

532
00:38:30,579 --> 00:38:34,379
Yeah. I remember you like jokes.

533
00:38:34,379 --> 00:38:36,160
Was that a good one?

534
00:38:37,920 --> 00:38:42,720
Are you Dr. Ye who was recalled from Taoyuan Village Clinic?

535
00:38:44,039 --> 00:38:46,531
Or are you her twin sister?

536
00:38:49,080 --> 00:38:51,740
Don't be nervous. I'm not accustomed to you like this.

537
00:38:51,740 --> 00:38:54,540
Relax. Take it easy.

538
00:39:00,139 --> 00:39:04,459
It turns out that you are truly the president.

539
00:39:05,320 --> 00:39:06,920
You don't doubt me anymore?

540
00:39:06,920 --> 00:39:08,920
Nope.

541
00:39:08,920 --> 00:39:11,280
Fine. Tea?

542
00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:12,660
No, thank you.

543
00:39:12,660 --> 00:39:16,319
President Gao gave it to me. The tea is good. Have a try.

544
00:39:16,319 --> 00:39:17,839
I couldn't.

545
00:39:19,199 --> 00:39:21,379
You don't want to catch up with me?

546
00:39:44,139 --> 00:39:49,180
<i>I, Lu Zhaoxi, hereby promise... to clean up the duck shed first</i>

547
00:39:49,180 --> 00:39:51,720
<i>The duck droppings. Pile them up in the vegetable field in the back.</i>

548
00:39:51,720 --> 00:39:53,779
<i>Scoop two large bowls and mix them.</i>

549
00:39:53,779 --> 00:39:54,959
<i>Do you think I'm a fool?</i>

550
00:39:54,959 --> 00:39:58,060
<i>Him. You're a liar!</i>

551
00:40:00,520 --> 00:40:03,260
Dr. Ye. Tea, please.

552
00:40:04,139 --> 00:40:08,439
President, I was too reckless in Taoyuan Village.

553
00:40:08,439 --> 00:40:11,679
I was wrong about you, making you suffer.

554
00:40:11,679 --> 00:40:15,460
I am here to sincerely apologize to you.

555
00:40:15,460 --> 00:40:17,560
Sorry.

556
00:40:19,700 --> 00:40:22,700
Dr. Ye, what was that for?

557
00:40:22,700 --> 00:40:25,024
This is indeed justifiable.

558
00:40:25,024 --> 00:40:27,299
There are always people selling medicinal alcohol who went to the village to defraud the villagers.

559
00:40:27,299 --> 00:40:29,180
And Granny Fang identified me.

560
00:40:29,180 --> 00:40:32,959
Your intention was good. You tried to help them. Right?

561
00:40:37,059 --> 00:40:38,759
Yes.

562
00:40:40,099 --> 00:40:42,999
But your good intentions didn't work out well.

563
00:40:42,999 --> 00:40:45,232
You still messed up.

564
00:40:45,819 --> 00:40:47,499
What do you think?

565
00:40:50,719 --> 00:40:52,870
You're right.
