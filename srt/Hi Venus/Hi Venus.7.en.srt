<i>[Hi Venus]</i>

15
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:29,840
<i>[Episode 07]</i>

16
00:01:30,419 --> 00:01:32,399
Chief Huang, you're so kind.

17
00:01:33,060 --> 00:01:34,759
However,

18
00:01:35,900 --> 00:01:37,300
do you want the truth?

19
00:01:37,300 --> 00:01:38,859
Of course.

20
00:01:39,700 --> 00:01:45,500
Someone from Pediatrics said you assigned the task of arranging the materials for your book to the team.

21
00:01:45,558 --> 00:01:47,499
Is that true?

22
00:01:51,580 --> 00:01:52,539
Yes.

23
00:01:52,539 --> 00:01:54,580
However, I didn't assign it.

24
00:01:54,580 --> 00:01:56,900
They asked to help me.

25
00:01:56,900 --> 00:02:00,900
And they said they would learn a lot by doing so.

26
00:02:00,900 --> 00:02:07,139
I feel quite happy about how motivated our young doctors are.

27
00:02:08,299 --> 00:02:12,200
Why did I hear that they have lots of negative emotions?

28
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:13,919
They do?

29
00:02:13,919 --> 00:02:17,140
No. You must be mistaken.

30
00:02:17,140 --> 00:02:18,539
Really?

31
00:02:19,179 --> 00:02:20,880
Have some tea.

32
00:02:21,539 --> 00:02:23,620
It happens that Dr. Ye is here.

33
00:02:23,620 --> 00:02:25,820
Dr. Ye, tell me.

34
00:02:25,820 --> 00:02:27,340
You also helped me arrange the materials.

35
00:02:27,340 --> 00:02:28,659
Did you volunteer to do that?

36
00:02:28,659 --> 00:02:31,739
Did you learn a lot from it?

37
00:02:36,459 --> 00:02:38,319
I... I...

38
00:02:38,319 --> 00:02:42,099
Chief Huang, you are scaring Dr. Ye.

39
00:02:44,860 --> 00:02:49,479
That's right. It was true that Dr. Ye told me about this problem, too.

40
00:02:54,220 --> 00:02:56,860
Chief Huang, the employees have negative emotions.

41
00:02:56,860 --> 00:03:00,479
As the president, I have to look into it.

42
00:03:03,140 --> 00:03:07,079
If that's the case, then it's really my problem.

43
00:03:07,079 --> 00:03:09,739
But I didn't hear any complaints.

44
00:03:09,739 --> 00:03:11,900
I didn't know.

45
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:15,398
President, you can rest assured. I will definitely make corrections.

46
00:03:16,379 --> 00:03:18,740
If there is something to change, change it; if there is nothing else, then encourage it.

47
00:03:18,740 --> 00:03:20,640
- Drink your tea.
- Okay.

48
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:02,739
President Lu, I should leave.

49
00:04:13,019 --> 00:04:14,520
Assistant Ye.

50
00:04:16,540 --> 00:04:19,820
While you do the cleaning, please light the scented candle in the living room for me.

51
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:26,519
You seem to be in a bad mood.

52
00:04:29,419 --> 00:04:32,540
Why did you tell Chief Huang that I said it?

53
00:04:36,139 --> 00:04:37,739
Because you did say it.

54
00:04:37,739 --> 00:04:40,220
We said that in private.

55
00:04:40,220 --> 00:04:43,440
Didn't you notice Chief Huang was pretending to be confused just now?

56
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:46,820
He already called you by name. What're you going to do then?

57
00:04:46,820 --> 00:04:50,059
Lie to him or back down?

58
00:04:51,060 --> 00:04:53,359
- I...
- That was a private occasion.

59
00:04:53,359 --> 00:04:55,459
I already gave leeway to everyone.

60
00:04:55,459 --> 00:04:59,200
Didn't you also hope that Chief Huang's problems could be improved?

61
00:04:59,900 --> 00:05:01,299
That is to say.

62
00:05:01,299 --> 00:05:03,310
- But...
- But what?

63
00:05:03,310 --> 00:05:05,880
If everyone doesn't admit that they are victims,

64
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:09,140
so how do I solve a problem without a victim?

65
00:05:12,340 --> 00:05:13,779
Fine.

66
00:05:13,779 --> 00:05:15,660
What you said is right.

67
00:05:16,179 --> 00:05:17,820
I've got to go.

68
00:05:40,980 --> 00:05:44,040
<i>[Yao Jiajia]</i>

69
00:05:45,179 --> 00:05:47,459
Hey.
<i>- I just saw your message.</i>

70
00:05:47,459 --> 00:05:49,900
<i>So Lu Zhaoxi sold you out.</i>

71
00:05:49,900 --> 00:05:51,300
Right.

72
00:05:51,300 --> 00:05:53,159
Chief Huang must hate my guts.

73
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:54,719
<i>You didn't talk to him about it?</i>

74
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:55,780
I did.

75
00:05:55,780 --> 00:05:58,679
But Lu Zhaoxi made it sound like he had a good point.

76
00:05:58,679 --> 00:05:59,739
I'm also at fault.

77
00:05:59,739 --> 00:06:01,820
At that critical moment, I didn't even know what to say.

78
00:06:01,820 --> 00:06:02,820
I'm so pissed.

79
00:06:02,820 --> 00:06:04,999
<i>And you said you admire him.</i>

80
00:06:04,999 --> 00:06:07,500
I was cheated and brainwashed by him.

81
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:11,038
If I had known this earlier, I'd have stayed in Taoyuan Village.

82
00:06:11,038 --> 00:06:12,779
Is he a fox?

83
00:06:12,779 --> 00:06:16,060
From now on, I must pretend to be dumb in front of him.

84
00:06:21,259 --> 00:06:24,058
I... I have things to do. Gotta go.

85
00:06:31,820 --> 00:06:32,880
Hello.

86
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:34,179
<i>Hello, I'm the cleaner.</i>

87
00:06:34,179 --> 00:06:35,678
<i>Could you open the door?</i>

88
00:06:35,679 --> 00:06:37,239
Okay.

89
00:06:44,459 --> 00:06:45,760
Hello.

90
00:06:45,760 --> 00:06:48,699
You're Aunt Peng, right?

91
00:06:49,419 --> 00:06:50,540
I'm President Lu's assistant.

92
00:06:50,540 --> 00:06:52,080
My name is Ye Shilan.

93
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:58,360
President told me that his nurse would cook meals for him from time to time.

94
00:06:58,360 --> 00:07:01,439
Yes. I'm here to cook for Xixi.

95
00:07:01,439 --> 00:07:03,639
Xixi?

96
00:07:03,639 --> 00:07:05,459
I won't disturb you then.

97
00:07:37,820 --> 00:07:40,619
Auntie, let me help you.

98
00:07:40,619 --> 00:07:42,398
No, no. You just relax.

99
00:07:42,398 --> 00:07:45,220
It's fine. I have nothing to do anyway.

100
00:07:45,220 --> 00:07:46,739
Then trim the green beans for me.

101
00:07:46,739 --> 00:07:48,620
I'm going to make soup.

102
00:07:48,620 --> 00:07:50,000
All right.

103
00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:57,719
Assistant Ye,

104
00:07:57,719 --> 00:08:02,040
I won't tell Xixi what I just heard.

105
00:08:03,540 --> 00:08:05,459
Thank you, Auntie.

106
00:08:06,620 --> 00:08:09,259
I've also been angry with him many times.

107
00:08:09,259 --> 00:08:12,499
So I completely understand your feelings.

108
00:08:12,499 --> 00:08:16,760
You've worked in their family for a long time, haven't you?

109
00:08:16,760 --> 00:08:18,140
Yes, for many years.

110
00:08:18,140 --> 00:08:20,579
I watched him grow up,

111
00:08:20,579 --> 00:08:22,699
and raised him as my own son.

112
00:08:22,699 --> 00:08:25,299
He has been naughty since he was a kid.

113
00:08:25,299 --> 00:08:27,100
These years, he went to study abroad

114
00:08:27,100 --> 00:08:28,820
and then has been busy with work,

115
00:08:28,820 --> 00:08:31,300
so we rarely see each other.

116
00:08:31,300 --> 00:08:33,259
It's been a lot more peaceful.

117
00:08:33,259 --> 00:08:35,139
I saw how angry you were just now.

118
00:08:35,139 --> 00:08:37,579
It seems that he hasn't changed.

119
00:08:38,499 --> 00:08:42,740
When he annoyed you, how would you react?

120
00:08:42,740 --> 00:08:45,020
There was once when he made me so angry.

121
00:08:45,020 --> 00:08:47,950
I secretly hid his exercise book away,

122
00:08:47,950 --> 00:08:50,150
so he'd get scolded by his teacher.

123
00:08:50,150 --> 00:08:51,380
You did?

124
00:08:51,380 --> 00:08:52,980
Of course.

125
00:08:52,980 --> 00:08:55,600
But he thought of a way to get back at me.

126
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:58,220
I hid his exercise book, and he swapped my salt.

127
00:08:58,220 --> 00:09:00,459
No matter what I cooked, it wouldn't taste salty.

128
00:09:00,459 --> 00:09:02,979
It's indeed something he would do.

129
00:09:02,979 --> 00:09:06,379
He remembers everything and gets back at you unexpectedly.

130
00:09:06,379 --> 00:09:09,259
Yeah, he's very vindictive.

131
00:09:09,259 --> 00:09:11,900
It's not easy to be his assistant.

132
00:09:15,740 --> 00:09:17,260
Assistant Ye.

133
00:09:17,260 --> 00:09:20,459
What do your parents do for a living?

134
00:09:21,259 --> 00:09:23,280
My dad...

135
00:09:23,280 --> 00:09:25,120
passed away.

136
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:28,579
My mom and her second husband sell vegetables in the market.

137
00:09:29,499 --> 00:09:32,340
Sorry, I shouldn't have asked.

138
00:09:32,340 --> 00:09:33,480
It's fine.

139
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:36,100
My dad died ages ago.

140
00:09:38,619 --> 00:09:42,000
Assistant Ye, can you cook?

141
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,379
Only some home-cooked meals.

142
00:09:45,180 --> 00:09:46,780
You learned cooking from your mom?

143
00:09:46,780 --> 00:09:48,400
No.

144
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:51,540
I started to live on campus since junior high school.

145
00:09:51,540 --> 00:09:55,479
After graduating from college, I moved out on my own.

146
00:09:55,479 --> 00:09:57,819
Then I had time to learn how to cook.

147
00:09:58,540 --> 00:10:00,980
So you're gifted.

148
00:10:00,980 --> 00:10:03,920
Come on. Have one.

149
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:05,060
Thank you, Auntie.

150
00:10:05,060 --> 00:10:06,290
You're welcome.

151
00:10:06,290 --> 00:10:08,220
Feel at home.

152
00:10:10,420 --> 00:10:12,180
Auntie.

153
00:10:12,180 --> 00:10:15,240
I mainly take care of President Lu in his daily life.

154
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:17,900
I just got transferred and don't know much about him.

155
00:10:17,900 --> 00:10:20,700
If there's any difficulty, may I ask you for help?

156
00:10:20,700 --> 00:10:22,660
Of course you may.

157
00:10:22,660 --> 00:10:26,559
You're still thinking about work when you're so mad at him.

158
00:10:26,559 --> 00:10:28,080
Being mad is one thing,

159
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:30,850
it's my responsibility to do my job well.

160
00:10:31,579 --> 00:10:34,358
Okay. I'll friend you on WeChat.

161
00:10:34,358 --> 00:10:36,479
Let me know if you need anything.

162
00:10:36,479 --> 00:10:37,899
Sure. Thank you.

163
00:10:37,899 --> 00:10:39,599
You're welcome.

164
00:10:41,259 --> 00:10:43,179
Assistant Ye, you can leave first.

165
00:10:43,179 --> 00:10:45,018
When Xixi comes back, the soup should be ready.

166
00:10:45,018 --> 00:10:46,739
I'll say hello to him before I go.

167
00:10:46,739 --> 00:10:49,079
Okay. It's been a hard day for you,

168
00:10:49,079 --> 00:10:51,739
helping and chatting with me all the time.

169
00:10:51,739 --> 00:10:55,358
You were the one chatting with me and you helped quiet my ruffled feathers.

170
00:10:55,358 --> 00:10:58,680
Though I don't know what happened between you,

171
00:10:58,680 --> 00:11:01,099
I guess I know Xixi well enough.

172
00:11:01,099 --> 00:11:03,018
He's essentially a good kid.

173
00:11:03,018 --> 00:11:06,699
I know. They were just some little frictions at work.

174
00:11:06,699 --> 00:11:08,300
It's nothing.

175
00:11:08,300 --> 00:11:10,399
It's good that you can think this way.

176
00:11:10,399 --> 00:11:14,138
By the way, what we talked about today was a secret.

177
00:11:14,138 --> 00:11:18,799
I don't want him to think that I speak ill of him behind his back.

178
00:11:18,799 --> 00:11:21,139
Sure. A secret.

179
00:11:21,139 --> 00:11:22,979
Auntie, I should get going.

180
00:11:22,979 --> 00:11:25,138
Okay, go ahead. Take care.

181
00:11:25,138 --> 00:11:26,679
Bye.

182
00:11:29,460 --> 00:11:30,860
<i>[Ye Shilan]</i>

183
00:11:31,740 --> 00:11:32,680
Hello.

184
00:11:32,680 --> 00:11:35,398
<i>President, the cleaner has done her job.</i>

185
00:11:35,398 --> 00:11:37,159
<i>I'm going home now.</i>

186
00:11:37,159 --> 00:11:39,339
I've lighted the scented candle in the living room.

187
00:11:39,339 --> 00:11:41,219
Aunt Peng made you dinner.

188
00:11:41,219 --> 00:11:43,618
She hasn't left yet, so I didn't blow out the scented candle.

189
00:11:43,618 --> 00:11:47,938
If there's no one at home, remember to blow it out to eliminate safety hazards.

190
00:11:48,860 --> 00:11:50,200
Okay.

191
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:52,859
<i>Anything else you want to tell me?</i>

192
00:11:52,859 --> 00:11:54,559
No.

193
00:11:55,320 --> 00:11:58,138
<i>Oh, remember to take a taxi the next time you come to my home.</i>

194
00:11:58,138 --> 00:12:00,459
<i>Take the money from my private account.</i>

195
00:12:00,459 --> 00:12:02,840
No need. I'll just ride my bike.

196
00:12:02,840 --> 00:12:05,420
If there's nothing else, I'll hang up.

197
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:07,661
I...

198
00:12:07,661 --> 00:12:10,120
♫ <i>The dream makes it come true</i> ♫

199
00:12:10,120 --> 00:12:16,120
♫ <i>So from now on, I'll be with you</i> ♫

200
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:22,278
♫ <i>So plan me into your future. Let me love you</i> ♫

201
00:12:22,278 --> 00:12:25,439
Aunt Peng, what did you cook?

202
00:12:25,439 --> 00:12:27,520
I'm starving.

203
00:12:27,520 --> 00:12:30,420
Your favorite braised pork.

204
00:12:30,420 --> 00:12:33,379
Mom, why are you here?

205
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:38,699
The noodles are ready.

206
00:12:38,699 --> 00:12:40,440
Take it easy.

207
00:12:43,459 --> 00:12:44,458
Not bad, huh?

208
00:12:44,458 --> 00:12:46,419
Sure enough, I'm used to eating instant noodles.

209
00:12:46,419 --> 00:12:49,359
Fancy meals always give me a stomachache.

210
00:12:49,359 --> 00:12:51,818
Gifts blind the eyes.

211
00:12:51,818 --> 00:12:54,619
Lu Zhaoxi is full of cunning tricks.

212
00:12:54,619 --> 00:12:57,298
- A top player.
- He's more than a top player.

213
00:12:57,298 --> 00:13:00,259
He's like a wily fox.

214
00:13:00,259 --> 00:13:02,718
When he and Chief Huang were making insinuations,

215
00:13:02,719 --> 00:13:05,738
I hardly dared to breathe. I was so afraid they'd accuse me.

216
00:13:05,738 --> 00:13:08,859
But in the end, I was still the target of blame.

217
00:13:08,859 --> 00:13:12,158
You just jumped into a war as a newbie.

218
00:13:12,158 --> 00:13:15,120
And you were against the boss.

219
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:17,999
There is too much difference in your ranks. That's why you were made a pawn.

220
00:13:17,999 --> 00:13:22,320
I should have thought about this before the big storm came.

221
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:25,100
It just happened so fast.

222
00:13:25,100 --> 00:13:27,618
There's always a calm before a storm.

223
00:13:27,618 --> 00:13:31,679
In terms of writing techniques, it's called criticism after compliment.

224
00:13:31,679 --> 00:13:33,679
I even gave him holly flowers, you know?

225
00:13:33,679 --> 00:13:36,938
He's now resilient, but I became a stepping stone for him.

226
00:13:36,938 --> 00:13:38,439
Isn't that annoying?

227
00:13:38,439 --> 00:13:40,559
Of course it's annoying to be betrayed.

228
00:13:40,559 --> 00:13:43,520
Lu Zhaoxi's integrity is questionable.

229
00:13:45,459 --> 00:13:49,559
Well, it's not that serious.

230
00:13:49,559 --> 00:13:54,059
He only chose the wrong way to do things.

231
00:13:54,699 --> 00:13:56,859
Why are you defending him?

232
00:13:56,859 --> 00:13:58,258
It's the truth.

233
00:13:58,258 --> 00:13:59,979
He's got a lot of wonderful qualities.

234
00:13:59,979 --> 00:14:02,240
It's unfair to completely deny him.

235
00:14:03,420 --> 00:14:07,760
Lu Zhaoxi must have known that you're softhearted, so you're under his thumb now.

236
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:10,259
That's why he's my nemesis.

237
00:14:10,259 --> 00:14:12,900
Every time I speak ill of him, he can find out.

238
00:14:12,900 --> 00:14:15,539
But that aunt I met is really a nice person.

239
00:14:15,539 --> 00:14:17,179
She promised to keep it a secret.

240
00:14:17,179 --> 00:14:20,840
Otherwise, he'd hold it against me again.

241
00:14:20,840 --> 00:14:25,359
From now on, keep your head clear when you're with him.

242
00:14:25,359 --> 00:14:27,399
Don't worry about me.

243
00:14:27,399 --> 00:14:30,200
I can get materials without him. No big deal.

244
00:14:31,280 --> 00:14:34,019
I'm not worried about you.

245
00:14:39,100 --> 00:14:42,760
Aunt Peng went back home, but you didn't have to lie to her.

246
00:14:42,760 --> 00:14:44,280
Come on, here.

247
00:14:44,280 --> 00:14:47,559
But at that time, she was speaking ill of you.

248
00:14:47,559 --> 00:14:51,759
If I told her I was your mother, would she get a wink of sleep?

249
00:14:51,759 --> 00:14:54,320
How would she work with you?

250
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:56,479
Did you really think so much?

251
00:14:58,440 --> 00:15:00,899
I guess when she mistook you for Aunt Peng,

252
00:15:00,899 --> 00:15:03,919
you just thought it was fun to play with her.

253
00:15:04,499 --> 00:15:07,080
But you also lied to her.

254
00:15:07,080 --> 00:15:09,320
I did that because of work.

255
00:15:09,980 --> 00:15:12,740
You made her your assistant because of work?

256
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:14,800
Of course. Or because of what?

257
00:15:16,318 --> 00:15:19,140
When you told me about Taoyuan Village,

258
00:15:19,140 --> 00:15:23,160
you seemed to be very drawn to her.

259
00:15:23,160 --> 00:15:25,959
I only admired her character.

260
00:15:26,919 --> 00:15:31,400
Love begins with admiration.

261
00:15:36,100 --> 00:15:39,959
You two are always together. Think about it.

262
00:15:39,959 --> 00:15:45,420
Was there a moment when you had a crush on her?

263
00:15:48,259 --> 00:15:50,040
So there was.

264
00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:52,799
No. That's not a crush.

265
00:15:52,799 --> 00:15:54,659
When you're with a beautiful female

266
00:15:54,659 --> 00:15:59,859
and under a certain atmosphere, you have abnormal reactions because of instinct. That's pretty normal.

267
00:15:59,859 --> 00:16:02,960
So you admit that Assistant Ye is beautiful.

268
00:16:04,300 --> 00:16:07,240
Mom, you're the most beautiful.

269
00:16:07,900 --> 00:16:10,879
Stop complimenting me.

270
00:16:11,640 --> 00:16:14,199
We don't need you to marry into a rich family.

271
00:16:14,199 --> 00:16:17,280
I just want you to find someone you really like.

272
00:16:17,280 --> 00:16:20,940
But you're thinking too much.

273
00:16:20,940 --> 00:16:22,839
Just leave me alone.

274
00:16:22,839 --> 00:16:27,219
When you're in a better place, I'll find a chance to explain to her.

275
00:16:27,219 --> 00:16:29,279
If nothing happens between you two,

276
00:16:29,279 --> 00:16:32,319
after she quits being your assistant, we won't see each other anymore.

277
00:16:32,319 --> 00:16:34,280
We won't affect each other.

278
00:16:35,159 --> 00:16:38,479
Do whatever you what. Just don't mess around.

279
00:16:38,479 --> 00:16:40,259
But you need to pay attention.

280
00:16:40,259 --> 00:16:44,339
Don't play tricks to upset her.

281
00:16:46,340 --> 00:16:48,480
So she did speak ill of me?

282
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:50,779
Do you want to know?

283
00:16:50,779 --> 00:16:51,760
No.

284
00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:54,059
I wouldn't tell you even if you wanted to know.

285
00:16:54,059 --> 00:16:56,659
This is a secret between us.

286
00:16:56,659 --> 00:16:59,179
I knew you wouldn't tell me.

287
00:16:59,179 --> 00:17:01,699
That's my mother.

288
00:17:13,219 --> 00:17:15,159
Here.

289
00:17:15,159 --> 00:17:17,640
- Morning.
- Morning.

290
00:17:18,620 --> 00:17:22,120
Dr. Zeng, give me Chief Huang's file.

291
00:17:22,120 --> 00:17:24,179
I haven't finished it yet. Is Chief Huang urging us?

292
00:17:24,179 --> 00:17:27,399
No. Chief Huang said he doesn't need us to help him.

293
00:17:27,399 --> 00:17:29,500
He asked me to collect all the materials and return them to him.

294
00:17:29,500 --> 00:17:32,380
Why is he so nice all of a sudden?

295
00:17:32,380 --> 00:17:34,919
After Assistant Lin came to us yesterday,

296
00:17:34,919 --> 00:17:37,360
Chief Huang got called away by the president.

297
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:39,699
I guess he got yelled at.

298
00:17:39,699 --> 00:17:42,300
But we didn't say anything yesterday.

299
00:17:42,300 --> 00:17:46,018
Yesterday morning, President asked Dr. Ye to get a book from Chief Huang.

300
00:17:46,018 --> 00:17:48,880
Maybe he had heard something.

301
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:51,918
I get it. Dr. Ye must be the snitcher.

302
00:17:51,918 --> 00:17:53,138
I didn't know Dr. Ye was so brave.

303
00:17:53,138 --> 00:17:56,218
She's now the president's favorite.

304
00:17:56,218 --> 00:17:57,959
The president even drops her home from work.

305
00:17:57,959 --> 00:17:59,218
Shut up.

306
00:17:59,218 --> 00:18:03,378
It's true. Dr. Jiang and I saw it with our own eyes.

307
00:18:03,378 --> 00:18:07,238
If this is the case, our department will rise up.

308
00:18:07,238 --> 00:18:09,098
You're naive.

309
00:18:09,098 --> 00:18:11,018
A new broom sweeps clean.

310
00:18:11,018 --> 00:18:15,219
After that, everything will be back to normal.

311
00:18:15,800 --> 00:18:18,159
So it's going to boomerang back on Dr. Ye?

312
00:18:18,159 --> 00:18:20,719
She lost her head.

313
00:18:20,719 --> 00:18:23,680
To be honest, I kind of admire Dr. Ye.

314
00:18:23,680 --> 00:18:26,579
At least she did something we dared not to do.

315
00:18:26,579 --> 00:18:28,679
And now she's done us a favor.

316
00:18:28,679 --> 00:18:31,580
We should thank her properly.

317
00:18:51,739 --> 00:18:52,879
Hello.

318
00:18:52,879 --> 00:18:54,680
<i>Hello. Your takeout is here.</i>

319
00:18:54,680 --> 00:18:56,180
<i>Please come down and get it.</i>

320
00:18:56,180 --> 00:18:58,580
Okay, I'm coming down now.

321
00:19:04,619 --> 00:19:05,618
- Hello.
- Hello.

322
00:19:05,618 --> 00:19:06,800
- No. 101, right?
- Yes.

323
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:07,799
This is your takeout.

324
00:19:07,799 --> 00:19:09,538
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

325
00:19:09,538 --> 00:19:11,899
<i>I bought a chocolate milkshake for you.</i>

326
00:19:11,899 --> 00:19:15,299
<i>Don't be fooled by Lu Zhaoxi's sweet words again.</i>

327
00:19:15,299 --> 00:19:17,219
When did he say sweet words to me?

328
00:19:17,219 --> 00:19:19,239
Assistant Ye.

329
00:19:26,440 --> 00:19:28,359
Let me get it.

330
00:19:29,700 --> 00:19:31,700
<i>[Don't be fooled by Lu Zhaoxi's sweet words again.]</i>

331
00:19:34,680 --> 00:19:37,239
Auntie, please clean this place up.

332
00:19:37,239 --> 00:19:38,418
Sorry, Auntie.

333
00:19:38,418 --> 00:19:39,839
It's fine, leave it to me.

334
00:19:39,839 --> 00:19:40,780
Thank you.

335
00:19:40,780 --> 00:19:42,320
No problem.

336
00:19:56,099 --> 00:19:57,999
What did you just order?

337
00:19:57,999 --> 00:19:59,800
I'll buy another one for you.

338
00:20:00,440 --> 00:20:03,398
No need. I dropped it myself.

339
00:20:04,060 --> 00:20:06,360
You were startled by me.

340
00:20:06,360 --> 00:20:09,739
Am I still that scary to you?

341
00:20:09,739 --> 00:20:11,500
No.

342
00:20:12,440 --> 00:20:15,019
You're still mad about what happened yesterday?

343
00:20:18,239 --> 00:20:20,179
No, I'm not.

344
00:20:35,490 --> 00:20:37,920
<i>[Don't be fooled by Lu Zhaoxi's sweet words again.]</i>

345
00:20:45,239 --> 00:20:48,540
Assistant Ye, takeouts can't be delivered upstairs?

346
00:20:48,540 --> 00:20:51,579
There's a policy in the hospital that we should get takeouts downstairs.

347
00:20:51,579 --> 00:20:53,940
Do you think that's a reasonable policy?

348
00:20:54,979 --> 00:20:58,720
I... I don't know.

349
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:03,019
This policy is for a better medical environment, of course it's reasonable.

350
00:21:03,019 --> 00:21:05,160
Why did you say you don't know?

351
00:21:05,160 --> 00:21:08,700
Since you think it's reasonable, why did you ask me?

352
00:21:11,239 --> 00:21:14,580
Buy me the same drink you just ordered.

353
00:21:14,580 --> 00:21:15,800
Is there any problem?

354
00:21:15,800 --> 00:21:17,660
No.

355
00:21:23,580 --> 00:21:25,060
Your warning worked.

356
00:21:25,060 --> 00:21:28,159
Chief Huang took back all the materials this morning.

357
00:21:28,159 --> 00:21:31,900
Swaying with the wind. That was fast.

358
00:21:32,499 --> 00:21:36,178
Why did you suggest to him about other things that happened in pediatrics?

359
00:21:36,178 --> 00:21:40,500
Without evidence, he'll definitely pass the buck.

360
00:21:40,500 --> 00:21:42,858
He's an old employee of Anxing,

361
00:21:42,858 --> 00:21:45,040
and the chief of a department.

362
00:21:45,040 --> 00:21:47,278
If we have no valid reason to deal with him,

363
00:21:47,278 --> 00:21:51,299
and he makes up stories in front of other chiefs and doctors,

364
00:21:51,299 --> 00:21:53,480
things will run against us.

365
00:22:00,379 --> 00:22:01,879
Come in.

366
00:22:04,820 --> 00:22:07,779
President, this is the drink you wanted.

367
00:22:07,779 --> 00:22:10,000
Do you know why I wanted it?

368
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,279
You want to compensate me?

369
00:22:12,279 --> 00:22:13,519
Take it away.

370
00:22:13,519 --> 00:22:15,640
No, thanks.

371
00:22:15,640 --> 00:22:19,339
I ordered another one for myself. I'm going back to work.

372
00:22:24,060 --> 00:22:26,539
Ordered one for herself?

373
00:22:28,460 --> 00:22:30,460
- What?
- Nothing.

374
00:22:30,460 --> 00:22:31,700
Spit it out.

375
00:22:31,700 --> 00:22:34,060
I just thought of an internet slang.

376
00:22:34,060 --> 00:22:36,179
What is it?

377
00:22:36,179 --> 00:22:41,500
"Woman... you've caught my eye."

378
00:22:43,979 --> 00:22:46,079
Are you kidding?

379
00:22:46,079 --> 00:22:48,360
Is Assistant Ye keeping a distance from you?

380
00:22:48,360 --> 00:22:49,859
Because you sold her out?

381
00:22:49,859 --> 00:22:52,100
I sold her out?

382
00:22:53,940 --> 00:22:55,580
Even if I didn't mention her name,

383
00:22:55,580 --> 00:22:58,219
Chief Huang would still have gotten even with her for it.

384
00:22:58,219 --> 00:23:00,060
That's because you made her your assistant.

385
00:23:00,060 --> 00:23:03,779
I'm doing my own thing. And I'm helping her.

386
00:23:04,979 --> 00:23:07,059
She will figure it out.

387
00:23:07,059 --> 00:23:08,959
I hope so.

388
00:23:17,339 --> 00:23:20,700
I wondered why he transferred Ye Shilan to be his assistant.

389
00:23:20,700 --> 00:23:23,280
So he was waiting for me to fall into the trap.

390
00:23:25,499 --> 00:23:28,159
- Associate Dean Xu. Chief Huang.
- Tell me. We...

391
00:23:28,159 --> 00:23:30,560
We all went through this.

392
00:23:31,499 --> 00:23:33,900
What's wrong with helping a superior do something?

393
00:23:33,900 --> 00:23:38,319
Why did he have to make it so serious, upholding justice?

394
00:23:38,319 --> 00:23:42,280
I already warned you to behave yourself.

395
00:23:43,920 --> 00:23:47,019
Dean Xu, you'd better not look down on Lu Zhaoxi.

396
00:23:47,019 --> 00:23:49,780
He just wants to build his resume.

397
00:23:49,780 --> 00:23:52,919
At that time, grandstanding will cause a lot of trouble.

398
00:23:52,920 --> 00:23:56,159
Don't you have to clean it up in the end?

399
00:23:56,159 --> 00:23:59,500
Take the documentary, for example.

400
00:23:59,500 --> 00:24:02,480
I don't know what he said to Chief Chen,

401
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:05,160
now he's not against it at all.

402
00:24:05,160 --> 00:24:09,020
Do all the pregnant women know about the documentary?

403
00:24:09,020 --> 00:24:10,519
I don't know.

404
00:24:10,519 --> 00:24:12,660
I haven't heard about it yet.

405
00:24:12,660 --> 00:24:15,419
It should be still in the confidential stage.

406
00:24:16,379 --> 00:24:18,580
Oh right! Well, Dean Xu,

407
00:24:18,580 --> 00:24:21,219
do you know that Chairman Zhang's daughter-in-law

408
00:24:21,219 --> 00:24:23,180
is going to deliver her baby in our hospital?

409
00:24:23,180 --> 00:24:27,059
I saw her earlier on in the OB-GYN.

410
00:24:39,719 --> 00:24:41,360
Dean Xu.

411
00:25:05,300 --> 00:25:10,740
<i>Yezi, how do you feel after getting back at Ye Zhaoxi?</i>

412
00:25:10,740 --> 00:25:14,459
<i>Seeing how frustrated he looked, I feel so happy.</i>

413
00:25:28,139 --> 00:25:29,939
President.

414
00:25:29,939 --> 00:25:31,500
What's up?

415
00:25:31,500 --> 00:25:33,359
Have you eaten?

416
00:25:33,359 --> 00:25:34,339
Not yet.

417
00:25:34,339 --> 00:25:36,858
What do you feel like eating? It's my treat.

418
00:25:39,420 --> 00:25:41,079
No, thanks.

419
00:25:43,339 --> 00:25:45,880
- Or you can treat me.
- Huh?

420
00:25:45,900 --> 00:25:47,399
Huh, what?

421
00:25:47,399 --> 00:25:49,520
You're not that stingy, are you?

422
00:25:51,019 --> 00:25:54,859
Well, what do you want to eat?

423
00:25:59,660 --> 00:26:01,159
Excuse me.

424
00:26:02,160 --> 00:26:04,499
- Please enjoy.
- Thanks.

425
00:26:05,479 --> 00:26:08,499
This restaurant is pretty nice, and it's near the hospital.

426
00:26:08,499 --> 00:26:10,139
Just make do with it.

427
00:26:10,139 --> 00:26:12,799
It's your call. I'm not picky.

428
00:26:12,799 --> 00:26:15,938
Assistant Lin said Chief Huang took back all the materials.

429
00:26:15,938 --> 00:26:18,639
You get all the credit for this.

430
00:26:18,639 --> 00:26:21,339
I don't want this kind of credit.

431
00:26:22,019 --> 00:26:25,000
But you told me you'd like to cooperate with me.

432
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:27,460
I regret it now.

433
00:26:27,460 --> 00:26:30,380
Are you so afraid of offending Chief Huang?

434
00:26:31,499 --> 00:26:35,960
President, I know you want to make Anxing Hospital a better place,

435
00:26:35,960 --> 00:26:38,018
and I admire that.

436
00:26:38,018 --> 00:26:40,780
But I only want to pull my own weight.

437
00:26:40,780 --> 00:26:45,339
When I go to work in Pediatrics again, I can be a pediatrician at ease.

438
00:26:51,060 --> 00:26:54,160
I thought you had a great sense of fairness.

439
00:26:55,019 --> 00:26:57,400
Will that pay my bills?

440
00:26:57,400 --> 00:27:00,160
Then will staying out of this make you happy?

441
00:27:00,160 --> 00:27:01,940
Does it matter to you whether I'm happy or not?

442
00:27:01,940 --> 00:27:03,940
Of course it does.

443
00:27:12,820 --> 00:27:16,620
I know you want to be a good president

444
00:27:16,620 --> 00:27:18,760
who cares about his employees.

445
00:27:18,760 --> 00:27:21,180
But you can stop brainwashing me.

446
00:27:21,180 --> 00:27:23,300
You think I'm brainwashing you?

447
00:27:23,300 --> 00:27:25,759
- Otherwise?
- I...

448
00:27:27,700 --> 00:27:30,439
I told you all this because I think of you as a friend.

449
00:27:30,439 --> 00:27:32,219
You think of me as a friend?

450
00:27:32,219 --> 00:27:35,600
Yes. Don't you feel a connection to me?

451
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:37,940
When I was trapped, you took me in.

452
00:27:37,940 --> 00:27:41,479
And you happened to be a doctor at Anxing Hospital, wishing to be transferred back.

453
00:27:41,479 --> 00:27:45,459
And I'm the new president of Anxing Hospital.

454
00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:50,099
It seems... we do have a connection.

455
00:27:50,780 --> 00:27:53,219
So you don't think of me as a friend?

456
00:27:53,959 --> 00:27:55,219
You're my superior.

457
00:27:55,219 --> 00:27:57,979
And a superior can't be your friend?

458
00:27:57,979 --> 00:28:00,200
Neither.

459
00:28:00,200 --> 00:28:02,459
Do you think I don't deserve you?

460
00:28:03,299 --> 00:28:08,880
How come? You're so excellent, and totally out of my league.

461
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:12,380
You only want friends in your league? Are you such a snob?

462
00:28:12,380 --> 00:28:13,820
I never thought of it in that way.

463
00:28:13,820 --> 00:28:15,599
- You did.
- I did?

464
00:28:15,599 --> 00:28:17,060
Yes, think about it.

465
00:28:17,060 --> 00:28:19,259
If you only see me as a superior,

466
00:28:19,259 --> 00:28:21,358
will you give me that attitude, talk back to me,

467
00:28:21,359 --> 00:28:23,639
and turn on me deliberately?

468
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:28,739
You must have taken me as a friend,

469
00:28:28,739 --> 00:28:31,419
and believed I wouldn't get mad and embarrass you.

470
00:28:32,499 --> 00:28:35,740
I really don't seem to be afraid of you.

471
00:28:36,580 --> 00:28:39,980
You're only afraid of Chief Huang and not me?

472
00:28:39,980 --> 00:28:42,480
If you hadn't seen me as a friend,

473
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:45,219
then you must have seen me as a pushover.

474
00:28:45,820 --> 00:28:47,660
How could I?

475
00:28:47,660 --> 00:28:51,260
Besides, you're not a pushover.

476
00:28:59,339 --> 00:29:01,219
Ye Shilan.

477
00:29:02,979 --> 00:29:04,899
Since we're friends,

478
00:29:04,899 --> 00:29:07,100
I'll call you by your name then.

479
00:29:07,100 --> 00:29:11,079
All right. But I'm used to calling you "President."

480
00:29:11,079 --> 00:29:13,938
Okay. Sounds cool.

481
00:29:13,938 --> 00:29:16,400
But you don't look like a president at all.

482
00:29:16,400 --> 00:29:20,119
In my impression, a president always wears a white coat.
<i>(院长 - Dean or President, depending on the person. Since Zhaoxi and Old Gao are not doctors, they are given the title of "vp/pres.")</i>

483
00:29:20,820 --> 00:29:23,239
Handsome Brother. Handsome Brother!

484
00:29:23,239 --> 00:29:25,180
Your girlfriend is so pretty.

485
00:29:25,180 --> 00:29:26,699
Why don't you buy her a flower?

486
00:29:26,699 --> 00:29:28,200
She's not my girlfriend.

487
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:30,700
But you look good together.

488
00:29:30,700 --> 00:29:33,499
I don't think she's in my league.

489
00:29:33,499 --> 00:29:36,999
Cut it out. Don't disturb her work.

490
00:29:37,619 --> 00:29:39,319
President.

491
00:29:39,319 --> 00:29:41,640
- President, hello.
- What a small world. Hello.

492
00:29:41,640 --> 00:29:44,039
Your girlfriend looks so pretty. Buy her a flower.

493
00:29:44,039 --> 00:29:46,579
- How much does it cost?
- Five bucks.

494
00:29:46,579 --> 00:29:48,119
I'll have one.

495
00:29:48,119 --> 00:29:49,680
Let's go.

496
00:29:52,580 --> 00:29:53,899
Smell it.

497
00:29:53,899 --> 00:29:55,820
May your love be as sweet as it.

498
00:29:55,820 --> 00:29:57,039
- Okay, thank you.
- Thanks.

499
00:29:57,039 --> 00:29:58,660
Wait.

500
00:29:58,660 --> 00:30:00,319
Girl.

501
00:30:02,440 --> 00:30:03,499
How many flowers have you got?

502
00:30:03,499 --> 00:30:05,699
15. It'll be 75 bucks.

503
00:30:05,699 --> 00:30:07,239
Okay, I'll take them all.

504
00:30:07,239 --> 00:30:09,079
What are you doing?

505
00:30:12,780 --> 00:30:14,740
Okay, I've paid.

506
00:30:16,900 --> 00:30:18,139
Here.

507
00:30:18,139 --> 00:30:20,718
- What are you doing?
- Take them.

508
00:30:22,339 --> 00:30:25,080
Handsome Brother, good luck!

509
00:30:25,080 --> 00:30:29,480
♫ <i>Beautiful, you're so beautiful, my baby</i> ♫

510
00:30:29,480 --> 00:30:32,798
♫ <i>Looking forward to the next surprising heartbeat</i> ♫

511
00:30:32,798 --> 00:30:34,159
Let's go.

512
00:30:36,600 --> 00:30:38,640
What are you up to?

513
00:30:39,619 --> 00:30:42,899
Just buying you flowers. Don't you like them?

514
00:30:42,899 --> 00:30:45,179
I'm asking why.

515
00:30:46,219 --> 00:30:48,280
I wanted to make you happy.

516
00:30:50,660 --> 00:30:53,300
I was thinking if I buy all of the flowers,

517
00:30:53,300 --> 00:30:55,439
she would go home earlier.

518
00:30:55,940 --> 00:30:58,718
She has more in stock. She won't go back so early.

519
00:30:58,718 --> 00:31:00,380
How do you know?

520
00:31:00,380 --> 00:31:03,920
When I was in college, I also sold flowers on the streets.

521
00:31:04,619 --> 00:31:07,600
To pay off living expenses?

522
00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:10,019
On Valentine's Day and Qixi Festival <i>(Chinese Valentines Day),</i>

523
00:31:10,019 --> 00:31:13,700
I can earn two months of living expenses in a day.

524
00:31:13,700 --> 00:31:15,999
That much?

525
00:31:15,999 --> 00:31:18,659
But I don't know about your standard of living.

526
00:31:18,659 --> 00:31:23,239
I only spent around a couple hundred bucks in a month.

527
00:31:25,540 --> 00:31:27,540
So when you were selling flowers,

528
00:31:27,540 --> 00:31:30,090
did you also sweet talk like them?

529
00:31:30,090 --> 00:31:33,800
Of course. I had to act passionate.

530
00:31:33,800 --> 00:31:35,979
If it's a girl, say that she's beautiful.

531
00:31:35,979 --> 00:31:38,499
If it's a boy, say that he's handsome.

532
00:31:38,499 --> 00:31:41,780
If it's a couple, wish them a happy relationship.

533
00:31:41,780 --> 00:31:45,439
If they aren't a couple yet, wish them to get together soon.

534
00:31:45,439 --> 00:31:47,500
And I have to read their mind.

535
00:31:47,500 --> 00:31:50,339
If they show a slight interest, I have to promote the flowers more.

536
00:31:50,339 --> 00:31:52,900
If they're not interested, I don't waste my time.

537
00:31:52,900 --> 00:31:55,759
Anyway, just use some sweet talking and say good words.

538
00:31:55,760 --> 00:31:58,000
Then I'll have good business.

539
00:31:59,520 --> 00:32:01,239
Why are you smiling?

540
00:32:01,979 --> 00:32:04,339
I see you smiling.

541
00:32:04,339 --> 00:32:08,920
It's just hard to imagine that you know how to sweet talk.

542
00:32:09,720 --> 00:32:11,279
Then you mustn't know

543
00:32:11,280 --> 00:32:15,339
how a nobody will come to terms with life just for a living.

544
00:32:21,599 --> 00:32:23,579
What are you doing?

545
00:32:23,579 --> 00:32:25,259
We're arriving at the hospital.

546
00:32:25,259 --> 00:32:26,879
I'm hiding the flowers,

547
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:29,300
or we'll get misunderstood walking together.

548
00:32:29,300 --> 00:32:31,739
Why didn't you explain just now?

549
00:32:32,199 --> 00:32:36,279
They should be able to tell that you were joking.

550
00:32:36,279 --> 00:32:38,339
Not necessarily.

551
00:32:39,540 --> 00:32:42,899
Let's go. Who cares what people think.

552
00:33:03,139 --> 00:33:07,298
<i>Assistant Ye, did Zhaoxi apologize to you?</i>

553
00:33:08,519 --> 00:33:11,519
<i>He doesn't need to. He didn't do anything wrong.</i>

554
00:33:11,520 --> 00:33:13,780
<i>It was my own fault.</i>

555
00:33:21,739 --> 00:33:24,400
<i>If he dares to bully you again, just tell me.</i>

556
00:33:24,400 --> 00:33:27,020
<i>I'll teach you how to deal with him.</i>

557
00:33:28,619 --> 00:33:30,479
<i>Thank you, Auntie.</i>

558
00:33:32,420 --> 00:33:33,160
President.

559
00:33:33,160 --> 00:33:35,259
Ye Shilan, help me clean up the tea set.

560
00:33:35,259 --> 00:33:36,560
I won't come back this afternoon.

561
00:33:36,560 --> 00:33:38,119
Okay.

562
00:33:44,739 --> 00:33:46,740
You made up with Assistant Ye?

563
00:33:46,740 --> 00:33:48,520
What do you mean by "made up"?

564
00:33:48,520 --> 00:33:50,999
Me and Ye Shilan have always been on the good terms.

565
00:33:50,999 --> 00:33:52,280
I can see that.

566
00:33:52,280 --> 00:33:54,840
You're calling her by her name.

567
00:33:54,840 --> 00:33:57,179
We're friends now.

568
00:33:57,920 --> 00:33:59,839
Assistant Ye really figured it out by herself?

569
00:33:59,839 --> 00:34:03,999
More than that. She even treated me to lunch.

570
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:10,559
Ye Shilan is not a stingy person.

571
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:13,300
She knows clearly who's right and who's wrong.

572
00:34:13,300 --> 00:34:16,180
I can never misjudge the one I appreciate.

573
00:34:16,700 --> 00:34:18,879
Nothing is set in stone.

574
00:34:19,500 --> 00:34:22,779
You're such a conversation killer.

575
00:34:23,579 --> 00:34:24,918
The headhunter we're going to meet

576
00:34:24,919 --> 00:34:26,779
is a specialist in the field of medical business.

577
00:34:26,779 --> 00:34:28,720
He has many resources.

578
00:34:28,720 --> 00:34:31,399
I just learned that he was my senior.

579
00:34:31,399 --> 00:34:32,920
Okay.

580
00:34:32,920 --> 00:34:34,480
You'll lead the conversation.

581
00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:35,959
Okay.

582
00:35:08,619 --> 00:35:10,760
Did you need me for something?

583
00:35:21,099 --> 00:35:22,579
Is President Lu courting you?

584
00:35:22,579 --> 00:35:24,520
Of course not.

585
00:35:25,139 --> 00:35:27,360
But it's not your business.

586
00:35:28,740 --> 00:35:29,760
Yes.

587
00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:33,859
I just want to remind you not to get too close to President Lu.

588
00:35:33,859 --> 00:35:37,179
People like him are best at confusing people's minds simply by talking.

589
00:35:37,179 --> 00:35:39,500
It is easy for you to be entangled, used as a gun,

590
00:35:39,500 --> 00:35:42,319
and turned into cannon fodder in the end.

591
00:35:42,319 --> 00:35:44,380
Do you know him?

592
00:35:44,819 --> 00:35:48,619
Don't gauge the heart of a gentleman with one's own mean measure.

593
00:35:48,619 --> 00:35:52,399
Look. Now you're defending him.

594
00:35:52,399 --> 00:35:54,760
How can you be so easily fooled?

595
00:35:54,760 --> 00:35:57,740
You were used by President Gao and offended Chief Huang.

596
00:35:57,740 --> 00:36:00,358
That's why they took so long to transfer you back. Why won't you learn your lesson?

597
00:36:00,358 --> 00:36:02,620
It has nothing to do with President Gao.

598
00:36:04,420 --> 00:36:06,519
You still don't get it.

599
00:36:06,519 --> 00:36:09,280
Ye Shilan, I won't do you harm.

600
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:11,339
Just listen to me, will you?

601
00:36:11,339 --> 00:36:12,700
Don't take a side so easily.

602
00:36:12,700 --> 00:36:15,460
And don't think the president can hold justice for you.

603
00:36:15,460 --> 00:36:16,999
Let's take Chief Huang as an example.

604
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:19,039
He made lots of contributions to our hospital.

605
00:36:19,040 --> 00:36:20,340
And he's a famous pediatrician.

606
00:36:20,340 --> 00:36:24,140
The president is not going to do anything to him just because he made some little mistakes.

607
00:36:24,140 --> 00:36:26,160
The president can do anything he wants to Chief Huang.

608
00:36:26,160 --> 00:36:28,319
It's not something I should worry about.

609
00:36:28,319 --> 00:36:30,339
I'm just a temporary assistant.

610
00:36:30,339 --> 00:36:31,700
Then...

611
00:36:35,859 --> 00:36:38,120
You're not going back to Pediatrics?

612
00:36:38,120 --> 00:36:41,140
Are you really confused or faking it?

613
00:36:41,140 --> 00:36:44,440
Lu Zhaoxi came to be the president of our hospital simply to build up his resume.

614
00:36:44,440 --> 00:36:47,358
Then he'll stand up and leave but you'll still be here.

615
00:36:47,358 --> 00:36:51,319
After you offended Chief Huang, what good can you get from this?

616
00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:05,899
So pretty.

617
00:37:05,899 --> 00:37:09,839
Why don't you put it in the hospital? You brought it back home.

618
00:37:09,839 --> 00:37:12,819
Lots of people come and go from the president's office.

619
00:37:12,819 --> 00:37:17,059
Won't it be weird if I put roses on my table?

620
00:37:17,059 --> 00:37:20,819
Lu Zhaoxi really gave you flowers because as a joke?

621
00:37:20,819 --> 00:37:22,600
What else could it be about?

622
00:37:22,600 --> 00:37:24,319
Don't have random thoughts

623
00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:25,740
just because the relation between us has thawed.

624
00:37:25,740 --> 00:37:28,379
Your relationship has not just thawed.

625
00:37:28,379 --> 00:37:29,940
You're even friends now.

626
00:37:29,940 --> 00:37:31,519
Friends.

627
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:35,159
Sometimes this word may cause confusion.

628
00:37:37,339 --> 00:37:40,278
Perhaps he was just being polite and it didn't mean anything.

629
00:37:40,278 --> 00:37:41,900
But I took it seriously.

630
00:37:41,900 --> 00:37:44,460
I'm going to get changed and take a shower.

631
00:37:44,460 --> 00:37:47,059
Yezi, are you in a bad mood?

632
00:37:47,059 --> 00:37:48,740
No.

633
00:37:48,740 --> 00:37:50,739
I'm just a little tired.

634
00:38:39,539 --> 00:38:42,080
Ye Shilan, morning.

635
00:38:42,080 --> 00:38:43,719
Morning, President.

636
00:38:43,719 --> 00:38:45,539
Let me open the door for you.

637
00:38:57,619 --> 00:38:59,439
You didn't change the flowers?

638
00:38:59,439 --> 00:39:00,718
I cut the roots and replaced the water.

639
00:39:00,719 --> 00:39:02,760
It'll probably last two more days.

640
00:39:05,440 --> 00:39:08,839
Well, you don't have to be so frugal.

641
00:39:08,839 --> 00:39:10,439
The new flowers I bought are on their way.

642
00:39:10,439 --> 00:39:12,999
I'll change them when I receive them.

643
00:39:12,999 --> 00:39:14,660
What flowers did you prepare for me?

644
00:39:14,660 --> 00:39:16,000
- I bought...
- Forget it.

645
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:19,900
Don't tell me first. I want a big surprise.

646
00:39:20,539 --> 00:39:22,320
President,

647
00:39:22,320 --> 00:39:24,020
you are putting me under a lot of pressure.

648
00:39:24,020 --> 00:39:26,039
Then turn your stress into motivation.

649
00:39:26,039 --> 00:39:29,539
Think it through and prepare with care.

Hello, Mom.

<i>is in the emergency room of the county hospital.</i>

654
00:40:02,180 --> 00:40:04,739
<i>The doctor suggested to transfer her to a bigger hospital.</i>

655
00:40:04,739 --> 00:40:07,740
<i>I'm going with Xiaowei to take care of her.</i>

656
00:40:07,740 --> 00:40:08,980
Are you coming to our hospital?

657
00:40:08,980 --> 00:40:12,140
<i>No, the Second Affiliated Hospital.</i>

658
00:40:13,020 --> 00:40:14,599
Do you need my help?

659
00:40:14,600 --> 00:40:17,859
<i>No, no. Don't worry. I just want to let you know.</i>

660
00:40:17,859 --> 00:40:19,980
<i>When we settle down, I'll give you another call.</i>

<i>Let's talk when we meet.</i>

662
00:40:21,280 --> 00:40:24,199
Okay. Listen to the doctor first.

663
00:40:24,199 --> 00:40:25,478
Call me if you need anything, Mom.

664
00:40:25,478 --> 00:40:27,959
<i>All right, all right. Bye-bye.</i>
