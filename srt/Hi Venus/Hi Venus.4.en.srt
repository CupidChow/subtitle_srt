<i>[Hi Venus]</i>

15
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:29,840
<i>[Episode 04]</i>

16
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:32,800
Sorry.

17
00:01:35,620 --> 00:01:38,600
Dr. Ye, what are you doing?

18
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:40,939
This is indeed justifiable.

19
00:01:40,939 --> 00:01:43,259
There are always people selling medicinal alcohol who went to the village to defraud the villagers.

20
00:01:43,259 --> 00:01:45,100
And Granny Fang identified me.

21
00:01:45,100 --> 00:01:49,000
Your intention was good. You tried to help them. Right?

22
00:01:52,980 --> 00:01:54,539
Yes.

23
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:58,980
But your good intentions didn't work out well.

24
00:01:58,980 --> 00:02:01,680
You still messed up.

25
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:03,380
What do you think?

26
00:02:06,679 --> 00:02:08,900
You're right.

27
00:02:10,299 --> 00:02:13,140
Have you received the B-ultrasound machine and medicines?

28
00:02:13,140 --> 00:02:14,400
Yes.

29
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:18,219
That's good. I have something to give you.

30
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:21,060
What is it?

31
00:02:24,379 --> 00:02:26,460
The money owed to you.

32
00:02:28,099 --> 00:02:31,139
President, I was really joking with you.

33
00:02:31,139 --> 00:02:33,000
I never thought to collect your money.

34
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,938
A gentleman's word is his bond.

35
00:02:34,938 --> 00:02:37,720
Are you trying to make me a bad guy?

36
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:40,899
- How can you be...
- For the ultrasound machine and medicine, I have kept my word.

37
00:02:40,899 --> 00:02:44,850
I don't want to ruin my reputation with this little money.

38
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:48,859
Count it.

39
00:02:53,379 --> 00:02:55,420
No need to count.

40
00:02:55,420 --> 00:02:57,420
I trust you.

41
00:02:58,900 --> 00:03:00,860
You take money seriously.

42
00:03:00,860 --> 00:03:03,079
The money will treat you seriously, too.

43
00:03:03,079 --> 00:03:04,579
Count it.

44
00:03:49,260 --> 00:03:51,039
How much in total?

45
00:03:51,839 --> 00:03:55,060
8,455 yuan.

46
00:03:55,060 --> 00:03:56,520
In total.

47
00:03:56,520 --> 00:03:58,040
That's correct.

48
00:03:58,040 --> 00:03:59,599
Fifty-five yuan for the medical treatment fee.

49
00:03:59,599 --> 00:04:02,099
Six thousand yuan for a three-night stay.

50
00:04:02,099 --> 00:04:03,399
Two thousand yuan for eight pieces of chicken.

51
00:04:03,399 --> 00:04:06,499
In total, eight thousand four hundred and fifty-five yuan.

52
00:04:08,639 --> 00:04:13,159
President... I was really joking with you.

53
00:04:13,159 --> 00:04:16,079
This is too much.

54
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:19,139
You don't have to feel bad about it. As much as you say.

55
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:24,558
I have a meeting later. Shall we have lunch together?

56
00:04:25,900 --> 00:04:27,579
My treat.

57
00:04:29,139 --> 00:04:32,779
Okay. Then you can go back to work.

58
00:04:44,660 --> 00:04:46,440
President!

59
00:04:48,259 --> 00:04:53,440
This Taoyuan Village thing is over, right?

60
00:04:54,879 --> 00:04:58,279
Don't worry. The future days are long.

61
00:04:59,479 --> 00:05:03,280
I owe you a clear account. Easy to settle.

62
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:06,570
But you owe me a mess of bookkeeping.

63
00:05:06,570 --> 00:05:09,200
It will take a long time to calculate.

64
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:11,119
Take your time.

65
00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:13,600
Go back to work.

66
00:05:46,419 --> 00:05:49,679
This is too much of a coincidence.

67
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:51,758
How can I be so unlucky?

68
00:05:51,758 --> 00:05:54,679
So unlucky.

69
00:05:55,879 --> 00:05:57,759
What are you doing?

70
00:05:58,620 --> 00:06:00,459
Nothing.

71
00:06:09,179 --> 00:06:12,758
Okay. Now we know each other.

72
00:06:12,758 --> 00:06:15,360
Everyone is busy, so there need not be a ceremony between us.

73
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:17,470
We hope that we can cooperate in the future.

74
00:06:17,470 --> 00:06:19,650
Do our respective jobs well.

75
00:06:19,658 --> 00:06:21,820
Today's meeting is also about another thing.

76
00:06:21,820 --> 00:06:24,250
It's about the filming of this documentary.

77
00:06:24,250 --> 00:06:27,260
I believe that you've seen some of the plans.

78
00:06:27,260 --> 00:06:28,659
Using newborns as the theme,

79
00:06:28,659 --> 00:06:30,739
focusing on Obstetrics, Gynecology, and Pediatrics.

80
00:06:30,739 --> 00:06:32,540
It is a public welfare project.

81
00:06:32,540 --> 00:06:35,859
I believe that all of you here may have some concerns.

82
00:06:35,859 --> 00:06:37,940
But from a long-term perspective,

83
00:06:37,940 --> 00:06:40,930
it will be helpful for hospital image enhancement.

84
00:06:40,930 --> 00:06:43,539
There are many forms of charity work.

85
00:06:43,539 --> 00:06:48,900
We are a hospital. We should consider Medical Care Quality first.

86
00:06:48,900 --> 00:06:52,450
With so many unrelated people walking around the hospital,

87
00:06:52,450 --> 00:06:55,050
will it affect our daily work?

88
00:06:55,059 --> 00:06:57,959
I have communicated with the producer about this issue.

89
00:06:57,959 --> 00:07:00,879
They will streamline the crew and not use large machines,

90
00:07:00,879 --> 00:07:03,819
and make the shooting natural to the greatest extent possible.

91
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:07,139
Chief Huang, you worry too much.

92
00:07:07,139 --> 00:07:10,978
I haven't heard of any medical malpractice due to making documentaries.

93
00:07:12,340 --> 00:07:15,958
The patient's emotional stimulation may also have an impact on their condition.

94
00:07:15,958 --> 00:07:18,298
President Gao, you are not a doctor.

95
00:07:18,298 --> 00:07:21,379
You're not working on the front lines. You have no idea.

96
00:07:21,379 --> 00:07:24,299
Yes, President Gao, you have no idea.

97
00:07:24,299 --> 00:07:27,700
For example, our pediatric department.

98
00:07:27,700 --> 00:07:31,663
When the children cry, it will get very loud.

99
00:07:33,459 --> 00:07:37,659
Chief Huang, I heard that the Pediatric Department knows many ways to coax children.

100
00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:42,238
It's just the time to teach the new parents with the documentary. Right?

101
00:07:57,859 --> 00:08:00,219
Chief Chen said last time.

102
00:08:00,219 --> 00:08:03,819
The reason why pregnant women choose our hospital's Ob/Gyn Department

103
00:08:03,819 --> 00:08:07,258
is because of the privacy and comfort.

104
00:08:07,258 --> 00:08:12,839
If you set up a camera to film at this time, what will these women think?

105
00:08:12,839 --> 00:08:14,799
Isn't that so, Chief Chen?

106
00:08:14,799 --> 00:08:18,100
For this problem, I'd already talked with Chief Chen.

107
00:08:18,100 --> 00:08:21,639
The pregnant women will mainly be concentrated in one area on a voluntary basis.

108
00:08:21,639 --> 00:08:23,979
Try not to affect the others.

109
00:08:25,019 --> 00:08:29,360
Chief Chen, I heard that your department is promoting painless childbirth.

110
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:31,139
The producer is very interested.

111
00:08:31,139 --> 00:08:35,539
Really? Then we can promote it together.

112
00:08:37,420 --> 00:08:40,078
Anyway, about making documentaries, I couldn't agree more.

113
00:08:40,078 --> 00:08:41,539
I will also follow the whole process.

114
00:08:41,539 --> 00:08:43,100
If there is a problem, solve the problem.

115
00:08:43,100 --> 00:08:45,259
If there are any adverse effects,

116
00:08:45,259 --> 00:08:47,359
I'll bear the responsibility.

117
00:08:48,180 --> 00:08:50,780
I agree with the president's opinion.

118
00:08:50,780 --> 00:08:54,019
Associate Dean Xu, what is your opinion?

119
00:08:54,019 --> 00:08:57,979
Since the president has said so, I have no objection.

120
00:08:59,220 --> 00:09:01,899
Good. That's a deal, then.

121
00:09:01,899 --> 00:09:05,279
You help me copy the list of personnel to my computer.

122
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:07,380
No problem. Dean, I'm leaving now.

123
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:09,000
Okay, I'll let you go.

124
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:12,499
Associate Dean Xu.

125
00:09:13,300 --> 00:09:17,578
I think the new president likes making a name for himself.

126
00:09:17,578 --> 00:09:20,559
Bear the responsibility? He better mean it!

127
00:09:20,559 --> 00:09:22,820
If he wants to do it, let him do it.

128
00:09:22,820 --> 00:09:27,392
As a young man, he can only know what is right when he tries it.

129
00:09:30,780 --> 00:09:35,180
Did you buy this book?

130
00:09:35,180 --> 00:09:36,720
There is no bookstore in the village.

131
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:39,499
It's okay. You can buy it online.

132
00:09:39,499 --> 00:09:42,000
How convenient is express delivery now?

133
00:09:45,139 --> 00:09:48,398
About the scheduling thing, it has already been arranged.

134
00:09:48,398 --> 00:09:50,640
You just got back.

135
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:53,219
It is not suitable to transfer anyone out.

136
00:09:53,219 --> 00:09:56,450
When will the schedule be available?

137
00:09:57,100 --> 00:09:59,300
I can only say that I will try.

138
00:10:01,540 --> 00:10:03,800
Thank you, Chief Huang. I'm leaving now.

139
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:05,140
Okay.

140
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:07,459
Wait a minute.

141
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:11,199
I have been thinking of writing a book recently.

142
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:15,139
About early detection and prevention of pediatric diseases.

143
00:10:15,139 --> 00:10:17,919
You don't have much work to do as of now.

144
00:10:17,919 --> 00:10:21,678
How about this? I have some materials here.

145
00:10:21,679 --> 00:10:25,570
Sort it out by symptoms when you're free.

146
00:10:26,819 --> 00:10:28,459
Is that okay?

147
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:33,579
Sure.

148
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:46,000
After she came back from the outside,

149
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,740
and... she has learned a lot.

150
00:10:50,259 --> 00:10:52,019
Hello, Dr. Guan.

151
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:58,780
<i>It took half a year to realize that it's no fun when I don't exist?</i>

152
00:10:58,780 --> 00:11:02,420
<i>Or did they especially transfer me back to do free labor?</i>

153
00:11:04,860 --> 00:11:07,100
<i>Is it because of Lu Zhaoxi?</i>

154
00:11:10,300 --> 00:11:12,280
<i>I hope not.</i>

155
00:11:17,580 --> 00:11:20,238
Will you go to the canteen at noon or go out?

156
00:11:20,239 --> 00:11:22,378
Go out to eat. I want to eat stone pot fish.

157
00:11:22,378 --> 00:11:23,439
Then it's on you.

158
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:25,179
Okay, it's on me.

159
00:11:25,180 --> 00:11:26,281
- Let's go.
- Go.

160
00:11:26,281 --> 00:11:29,179
Move. Dr. Zhong will buy us dinner.

161
00:11:29,179 --> 00:11:31,199
Dr. Ye is back, isn't she? Call her.

162
00:11:31,199 --> 00:11:32,640
Okay, let's call her.

163
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:36,639
Forget it. She never liked hanging out with us.

164
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,180
Dr. Ye, you're back.

165
00:11:41,180 --> 00:11:43,958
I'll treat everyone to dinner. Come with us.

166
00:11:43,958 --> 00:11:46,718
I'm not hungry yet. Don't mind me.

167
00:11:46,718 --> 00:11:48,219
Okay.

168
00:12:03,619 --> 00:12:05,520
Laugh?

169
00:12:06,740 --> 00:12:09,420
My sympathies for what happened to you.

170
00:12:09,420 --> 00:12:11,740
But it's really too funny.

171
00:12:11,740 --> 00:12:15,350
He is really the president of your hospital!

172
00:12:16,780 --> 00:12:19,159
When I was in his office today,

173
00:12:19,159 --> 00:12:23,379
I was like a beaten snake, a scaredy cat.

174
00:12:23,379 --> 00:12:25,220
Such torture.

175
00:12:25,220 --> 00:12:29,239
But it sounds like this guy is quite interesting.

176
00:12:29,239 --> 00:12:32,420
Interesting? Not in a good way, right?

177
00:12:32,420 --> 00:12:34,678
He deliberately made me take the cash. His words had a hidden meaning.

178
00:12:34,678 --> 00:12:36,379
Obviously, it was to deliberately torment me.

179
00:12:36,379 --> 00:12:37,959
Look at the bright side.

180
00:12:37,960 --> 00:12:39,740
At least the money is not counterfeit.

181
00:12:39,740 --> 00:12:41,300
It would be nice if it was counterfeit money.

182
00:12:41,300 --> 00:12:43,579
I also have the option to call the police.

183
00:12:43,579 --> 00:12:45,120
Don't think too much.

184
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:47,880
He was just trying to frighten you for some fun.

185
00:12:47,880 --> 00:12:51,350
Didn't you humiliate him in Taoyuan Village?

186
00:12:52,220 --> 00:12:56,640
Yeah. I asked for it.

187
00:12:56,640 --> 00:13:00,420
However, there is one more thing he doesn't know.

188
00:13:00,420 --> 00:13:03,059
If he knows it, it'll be worse.

189
00:13:03,059 --> 00:13:04,780
What is it?

190
00:13:04,780 --> 00:13:07,860
I took a picture of him secretly and sent it to my mom,

191
00:13:07,860 --> 00:13:10,660
saying that... he was my boyfriend.

192
00:13:10,660 --> 00:13:12,180
Why?

193
00:13:12,180 --> 00:13:13,980
Because my mom was pushing me.

194
00:13:13,980 --> 00:13:15,819
There was no one else around me.

195
00:13:15,819 --> 00:13:19,339
You should have contacted me and I'd have created one for you.

196
00:13:19,339 --> 00:13:22,839
I had some wine. My brain wasn't functioning.

197
00:13:25,579 --> 00:13:28,180
Your president is handsome, huh?

198
00:13:29,420 --> 00:13:30,399
Not bad.

199
00:13:30,399 --> 00:13:32,019
So he is very handsome.

200
00:13:32,019 --> 00:13:35,320
According to the current relationship between you two, evaluation should be increased by at least two levels.

201
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:37,340
You must have subconsciously thought

202
00:13:37,340 --> 00:13:39,320
it would be nice if he was your boyfriend.

203
00:13:39,320 --> 00:13:42,599
That's why you chose to take the picture of him.

204
00:13:42,599 --> 00:13:46,239
Don't talk nonsense. I regret it now!

205
00:13:47,159 --> 00:13:50,280
I was thinking... to confess to him.

206
00:13:50,280 --> 00:13:52,740
Let the storm come at once.

207
00:13:52,740 --> 00:13:55,139
Here is my advice. Don't get yourself into trouble.

208
00:13:55,139 --> 00:13:58,220
The most important thing you can do now is to avoid him.

209
00:13:58,220 --> 00:13:59,719
Just like when I write a novel.

210
00:13:59,719 --> 00:14:01,259
The hero and heroine don't meet.

211
00:14:01,259 --> 00:14:02,900
How can the bossy president be bossy?

212
00:14:02,900 --> 00:14:04,740
How can the sassy girl be sassy?

213
00:14:04,740 --> 00:14:08,640
Without intersection, there will be no conflict.

214
00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:14,880
Although it sounds odd, it seems to make sense.

215
00:14:15,839 --> 00:14:19,180
Drinking coffee at night, can you still sleep?

216
00:14:19,180 --> 00:14:22,059
I don't work tomorrow. I'm going to stay up late to write.

217
00:14:22,059 --> 00:14:25,279
Why don't you take a day off tomorrow? To lay low.

218
00:14:25,279 --> 00:14:27,100
No need.

219
00:14:27,100 --> 00:14:30,538
Obstetrics and Gynecology will have promotional activities in the mall tomorrow.

220
00:14:30,538 --> 00:14:33,780
Anyone with no scheduled work have to go help.

221
00:14:33,780 --> 00:14:35,459
I should be able to avoid him.

222
00:14:35,459 --> 00:14:36,819
Don't think so much about it.

223
00:14:36,819 --> 00:14:38,699
Don't cross the bridge till you come to it.

224
00:14:38,699 --> 00:14:40,699
Let's go and put on a mask.

225
00:14:40,699 --> 00:14:42,180
Go.

226
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:55,499
<i>You told me last night</i>

227
00:15:55,499 --> 00:15:58,959
<i>that I was drunk and called you to propose.</i>

228
00:15:58,959 --> 00:16:01,880
<i>I thought about it carefully.</i>

229
00:16:01,880 --> 00:16:04,899
<i>Ever since my dad got sick...</i>

230
00:16:10,139 --> 00:16:13,919
<i>As president, is it going well??</i>

231
00:16:13,919 --> 00:16:17,580
I'm guessing it won't go too well but I can handle it.

232
00:16:17,580 --> 00:16:22,000
<i>I heard you didn't go to work normally a while ago.</i>

233
00:16:23,059 --> 00:16:24,459
There was a small accident.

234
00:16:24,459 --> 00:16:26,379
Let my mother explain it to you later.

235
00:16:26,379 --> 00:16:28,060
<i>Here I am.</i>

236
00:16:28,060 --> 00:16:30,919
<i>Don't just talk about work once you come back from a business trip.</i>

237
00:16:30,919 --> 00:16:32,519
<i>I'll tell you later.</i>

238
00:16:32,519 --> 00:16:36,299
<i>He was stuck in the mountains and came across a very interesting female doctor.</i>

239
00:16:36,299 --> 00:16:38,039
<i>- He likes her.</i>
- Come on, Mom.

240
00:16:38,039 --> 00:16:40,220
Stop adding oil to the vinegar.

241
00:16:40,220 --> 00:16:42,440
<i>It's a reasonable interpretation.</i>

242
00:16:42,440 --> 00:16:45,919
<i>By the way, remember to eat the dishes Aunt Peng cooked for you.</i>

243
00:16:45,919 --> 00:16:48,139
<i>They can't be stored in the refrigerator for too long.</i>

244
00:16:48,139 --> 00:16:49,939
Okay, I won't forget.

245
00:16:49,939 --> 00:16:52,880
<i>Eyes on the road. Be safe.</i>

246
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:54,559
Bye-bye.

247
00:17:05,259 --> 00:17:07,259
What bad luck!

248
00:17:36,060 --> 00:17:38,120
Morning, Dr. Ye.

249
00:17:38,859 --> 00:17:40,819
Good morning, President.

250
00:17:53,219 --> 00:17:55,780
Are you avoiding me on purpose?

251
00:17:55,780 --> 00:17:57,440
No.

252
00:17:57,440 --> 00:18:01,280
That's good. Don't think about lying.

253
00:18:03,039 --> 00:18:06,560
President, you forgot to press the elevator button.

254
00:18:07,099 --> 00:18:10,600
I didn't. I was waiting for you on purpose.

255
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:20,560
Remember what I told you?

256
00:18:21,180 --> 00:18:23,019
You'll regret it.

257
00:18:24,239 --> 00:18:26,239
I already regret it.

258
00:18:26,239 --> 00:18:28,460
Regret is no longer useful.

259
00:18:34,460 --> 00:18:36,800
Are you happy working here?

260
00:18:38,079 --> 00:18:39,900
Not bad.

261
00:18:39,900 --> 00:18:41,580
It means you're not satisfied.

262
00:18:41,580 --> 00:18:44,150
There are areas for improvement, right?

263
00:18:44,700 --> 00:18:46,859
It's hard to say.

264
00:18:46,859 --> 00:18:49,420
Assistant Lin will publish the President's Mailbox soon.

265
00:18:49,420 --> 00:18:53,239
If you have any good suggestions, feel free to send me an email.

266
00:18:59,339 --> 00:19:02,199
President, I have to go.

267
00:19:20,580 --> 00:19:22,619
Have you heard about the President's Mailbox?

268
00:19:22,619 --> 00:19:23,759
Yes, I have.

269
00:19:23,759 --> 00:19:26,660
What? Do you want to make a suggestion?

270
00:19:26,660 --> 00:19:28,699
I haven't thought about it yet.

271
00:19:30,859 --> 00:19:34,780
They're just saying nice things. Don't take it seriously.

272
00:19:34,780 --> 00:19:38,119
You don't want to offend him. The loss outweighs the gain.

273
00:19:38,119 --> 00:19:42,340
Haven't you noticed that the biggest nit-picker in our department has kept a low profile?

274
00:19:44,279 --> 00:19:48,120
Dr. Zeng. Dr. Ye. Meet me downstairs in fifteen minutes.

275
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:50,500
- Okay.
- Copy that.

276
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:53,900
Please help me with this. This one.

277
00:19:56,340 --> 00:19:59,360
<i>[Our Anxing Hospital: Painless Delivery Guide]</i>

278
00:20:00,239 --> 00:20:02,258
Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen.

279
00:20:02,258 --> 00:20:04,399
Thank you for taking time out of your busy schedule to participate

280
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:09,540
in our Anxing Hospital's promotion of painless delivery.

281
00:20:09,540 --> 00:20:11,420
When it comes to painless delivery,

282
00:20:11,420 --> 00:20:13,839
what you are probably most worried about is

283
00:20:13,839 --> 00:20:15,438
will the anesthetic medicine for painless delivery

284
00:20:15,439 --> 00:20:19,240
affect the fetus and maternal health?

285
00:20:19,240 --> 00:20:22,438
In fact, the anesthetic dose for the implementation of painless childbirth

286
00:20:22,438 --> 00:20:25,879
is only one-tenth or less for a cesarean section.

287
00:20:25,880 --> 00:20:28,938
So there is nothing to worry about whether it affects the brain of the fetus

288
00:20:28,938 --> 00:20:32,640
and physical development, or causes any bad influence.

289
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:34,698
- Most importantly, it can also largely...
- Xinyu.

290
00:20:34,698 --> 00:20:37,939
The doctor in OB/GYN told me just now

291
00:20:37,939 --> 00:20:41,699
we will operate together on stage with this doctor.

292
00:20:41,699 --> 00:20:43,659
They will answer the questions below.

293
00:20:43,659 --> 00:20:45,139
Okay.

294
00:20:45,859 --> 00:20:47,519
Let's walk. Accompany me to the bathroom.

295
00:20:47,519 --> 00:20:48,780
Learn more about painless childbirth.

296
00:20:48,780 --> 00:20:50,259
Okay.

297
00:20:50,979 --> 00:20:54,359
You were not familiar with pediatrics before, so you don't know Dr. Ye.

298
00:20:54,359 --> 00:20:59,059
She was the one who confessed to Dr. Jiang but was turned down.

299
00:21:00,139 --> 00:21:03,699
So she went to the countryside for healing?

300
00:21:03,699 --> 00:21:04,939
Half and half.

301
00:21:04,939 --> 00:21:06,618
She is arrogant and an outcast.

302
00:21:06,618 --> 00:21:08,699
Maybe she likes living in the countryside.

303
00:21:08,699 --> 00:21:11,379
Hello. Learn more about painless childbirth. Thank you.

304
00:21:11,379 --> 00:21:13,779
- Learn more about painless childbirth.
- Okay.

305
00:21:36,739 --> 00:21:39,179
All of you here, you've all seen this.

306
00:21:39,179 --> 00:21:41,698
There are three instruments on the stage,

307
00:21:41,698 --> 00:21:44,200
which are the experience instruments for labor pains.

308
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:46,830
There are ten levels in total.

309
00:21:46,830 --> 00:21:50,278
If any gentlemen are interested, you can come up to the stage and take the challenge.

310
00:21:50,278 --> 00:21:53,539
You will be successful when it comes to the seventh level.

311
00:21:53,539 --> 00:21:56,138
And we will give you a reward.

312
00:21:56,138 --> 00:21:58,659
Medical checkup packages at Anxing Hospital.

313
00:21:58,659 --> 00:22:01,840
Anyone willing to come up and try it out?

314
00:22:05,180 --> 00:22:07,239
<i>Why not go up and try?</i>

315
00:22:07,239 --> 00:22:11,430
Any gentlemen want to challenge?

316
00:22:15,399 --> 00:22:16,639
Don't be embarrassed.

317
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:18,839
Let me be the first one.

318
00:22:19,700 --> 00:22:20,940
<i>This man is so handsome.</i>

319
00:22:20,940 --> 00:22:22,800
Please come on to the stage.

320
00:22:26,680 --> 00:22:29,710
Let me introduce this gentleman to you all.

321
00:22:29,710 --> 00:22:33,400
This is President Lu of Anxing Hospital.

322
00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:37,859
President Lu, please tell us. Why do you want to come up and try?

323
00:22:37,859 --> 00:22:41,980
Thank you, Chief Chen. Good afternoon, everyone.

324
00:22:41,980 --> 00:22:45,898
I am standing here today, not as the president of Anxing Hospital,

325
00:22:45,898 --> 00:22:48,320
just as an ordinary man.

326
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:50,299
The pain of childbirth,

327
00:22:50,299 --> 00:22:53,398
I believe that all the men in this room, including me,

328
00:22:53,398 --> 00:22:56,579
only understand its literal meaning.

329
00:22:56,579 --> 00:23:00,219
Maybe one day, at the time of our wife's delivery,

330
00:23:00,219 --> 00:23:03,718
we will hold her hand and tell her, "Can you hold on a little longer?"

331
00:23:03,718 --> 00:23:06,820
If we have never felt what she is feeling,

332
00:23:06,820 --> 00:23:11,519
isn't this insistence a bit too pale?

333
00:23:12,999 --> 00:23:18,759
I also know that all the men here may have brought their girlfriends or wives here today.

334
00:23:18,759 --> 00:23:22,618
I just want to ask if anyone is willing to join me for a challenge?

335
00:23:29,999 --> 00:23:32,180
- Good.
- This one.

336
00:23:34,179 --> 00:23:36,939
Please come on the stage.

337
00:23:36,939 --> 00:23:39,219
Welcome, these two gentlemen.

338
00:23:39,219 --> 00:23:41,079
Come on.

339
00:23:54,660 --> 00:23:56,218
Is everyone ready?

340
00:23:56,218 --> 00:23:58,719
When you are ready, our challenge will start soon.

341
00:23:58,719 --> 00:24:00,859
Excuse me, Chief Chen.

342
00:24:00,859 --> 00:24:03,260
I would like to change the seats with him.

343
00:24:03,260 --> 00:24:04,900
Otherwise, they will suspect that I am a shill,

344
00:24:04,900 --> 00:24:07,350
and this machine doesn't work at all.

345
00:24:08,099 --> 00:24:11,218
Okay, President Lu wants to change seats. Come.

346
00:24:11,218 --> 00:24:12,859
Thank you.

347
00:24:16,330 --> 00:24:19,070
Please apply electrode sheets to them.

348
00:24:19,070 --> 00:24:21,870
Our challenge begins now.

349
00:24:33,479 --> 00:24:34,859
You did it on purpose.

350
00:24:34,859 --> 00:24:38,320
Yeah. Because I'm more familiar with you.

351
00:24:40,900 --> 00:24:42,500
Afraid to hurt me?

352
00:24:42,500 --> 00:24:45,199
I'm afraid you'll hold a grudge.

353
00:24:45,199 --> 00:24:46,899
It is possible.

354
00:24:47,660 --> 00:24:51,419
Now the three gentlemen get ready.

355
00:24:51,419 --> 00:24:55,290
Good, our challenge starts now.

356
00:24:58,200 --> 00:25:00,579
<i>Strength level one.</i>

357
00:25:03,230 --> 00:25:05,180
At this level, you feel nothing.

358
00:25:05,180 --> 00:25:07,520
Let's move up a level.

359
00:25:09,639 --> 00:25:11,880
<i>Strength level two.</i>

360
00:25:15,480 --> 00:25:18,479
Move to the third level.

361
00:25:20,300 --> 00:25:22,479
<i>Strength level three.</i>

362
00:25:24,399 --> 00:25:26,940
One more level up.

363
00:25:26,940 --> 00:25:29,339
<i>Strength level four.</i>

364
00:25:34,639 --> 00:25:37,800
Move to the fifth level.

365
00:25:38,440 --> 00:25:40,839
<i>Strength level five.</i>

366
00:25:47,259 --> 00:25:49,741
Stop! Okay, stop!

367
00:25:50,739 --> 00:25:55,118
- Come.
- End of delivery. Let's give him a little applause.

368
00:25:56,000 --> 00:26:00,290
And also to the remaining guys.

369
00:26:02,900 --> 00:26:06,460
We will move up one more level.

370
00:26:08,580 --> 00:26:10,260
<i>Strength level six.</i>

371
00:26:10,260 --> 00:26:13,539
It's only a few minutes on the stage.

372
00:26:13,539 --> 00:26:18,419
But in the process of delivery, it usually takes several hours.

373
00:26:18,419 --> 00:26:20,359
A long delivery process.

374
00:26:20,359 --> 00:26:24,979
For those who haven't experienced it, it is an unimaginable test.

375
00:26:24,979 --> 00:26:27,340
Good. Very good.

376
00:26:27,340 --> 00:26:30,940
Move to the seventh level.

377
00:26:37,139 --> 00:26:39,140
<i>- Strength level seven.</i>
- Hang in there.

378
00:26:39,140 --> 00:26:40,378
Countdown.

379
00:26:40,378 --> 00:26:41,698
Five!

380
00:26:41,698 --> 00:26:42,679
<i>Four!</i>

381
00:26:42,680 --> 00:26:43,759
<i>Three!</i>

382
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:44,759
<i>Two!</i>

383
00:26:44,760 --> 00:26:45,619
<i>One!</i>

384
00:26:45,619 --> 00:26:51,420
Go for it! Go for it! Go for it!

385
00:26:51,420 --> 00:26:53,799
- I can't do this.
- Stop!

386
00:26:53,799 --> 00:26:57,579
We can see that the pain is unbearable.

387
00:26:57,579 --> 00:27:00,459
Let's give him a round of applause.

388
00:27:05,639 --> 00:27:07,598
I have good news.

389
00:27:07,599 --> 00:27:10,819
President Lu hopes to experience the next level.

390
00:27:10,819 --> 00:27:17,300
<i>Go for it!</i>

391
00:27:17,300 --> 00:27:18,399
Don't get ahead of yourself.

392
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:20,800
<i>Go for it!</i>

393
00:27:20,800 --> 00:27:21,780
Bring it on.

394
00:27:21,780 --> 00:27:27,579
<i>Go for it!</i>

395
00:27:27,579 --> 00:27:28,958
<i>Strength level eight.</i>

396
00:27:28,959 --> 00:27:34,838
<i>Go for it!</i>

397
00:27:34,839 --> 00:27:36,118
Countdown.

398
00:27:36,119 --> 00:27:37,118
<i>Five!</i>

399
00:27:37,119 --> 00:27:38,198
<i>Four!</i>

400
00:27:38,199 --> 00:27:39,399
<i>Three!</i>

401
00:27:39,400 --> 00:27:40,358
<i>Two!</i>

402
00:27:40,359 --> 00:27:41,739
<i>One!</i>

403
00:27:41,739 --> 00:27:44,040
End of delivery.

404
00:27:44,040 --> 00:27:46,319
Challenge succeeded!

405
00:28:06,760 --> 00:28:11,739
<i>Anodyne drugs are used in obstetrics to reduce pain levels during delivery.</i>

406
00:28:11,739 --> 00:28:14,379
<i>A method to improve the comfort level of parturients during childbirth.</i>

407
00:28:14,379 --> 00:28:16,959
- President.
<i>- Through analgesic drugs...</i>

408
00:28:16,959 --> 00:28:19,439
You must be sweaty. Have some water.

409
00:28:19,439 --> 00:28:21,338
<i>Effectively improve the quality of delivery.</i>

410
00:28:21,338 --> 00:28:22,980
Thank you.

411
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:25,870
<i>But this method...</i>

412
00:28:25,870 --> 00:28:29,560
While in Taoyuan Village, I thought you were afraid of pain.

413
00:28:29,560 --> 00:28:32,419
In fact, you didn't need to be brave just now.

414
00:28:34,700 --> 00:28:36,720
Are you concerned about me?

415
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:38,980
I thought you would have had a little fun.

416
00:28:38,980 --> 00:28:41,459
I'm not a pervert.

417
00:28:41,459 --> 00:28:43,600
Feels like you are scolding me.

418
00:28:44,499 --> 00:28:46,199
I'm not.

419
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:49,540
I'm not trying to be brave.

420
00:28:49,540 --> 00:28:53,330
It's just a habit of wanting to do a little bit better than others.

421
00:28:54,239 --> 00:28:56,280
More than a little.

422
00:28:57,700 --> 00:29:02,800
Many people think that helping their wives to share some housework during pregnancy make them good men.

423
00:29:02,860 --> 00:29:06,758
If they can accompany their wives, they are the best men in the world.

424
00:29:06,758 --> 00:29:10,110
They said they would be willing to suffer from the delivery pain for their wives,

425
00:29:10,110 --> 00:29:13,100
because they know they will never feel the pain.

426
00:29:13,680 --> 00:29:15,639
Though this is the experience today,

427
00:29:15,639 --> 00:29:17,860
you have exceeded the majority of those people.

428
00:29:17,860 --> 00:29:21,159
It was a very good performance.

429
00:29:22,900 --> 00:29:25,180
You're trying to impress me on purpose.

430
00:29:25,180 --> 00:29:27,760
I'm just talking about the facts.

431
00:29:29,660 --> 00:29:31,159
Thank you.

432
00:29:31,159 --> 00:29:33,850
<i>Next, we will start the second round.</i>

433
00:29:33,850 --> 00:29:35,378
Is anyone willing to challenge on stage?

434
00:29:35,378 --> 00:29:36,738
I'll go to work, then.

435
00:29:36,738 --> 00:29:38,419
Get to i.

436
00:29:46,159 --> 00:29:49,578
Hey, Manager Liu, do you still have a room tonight?

437
00:29:49,578 --> 00:29:51,818
Yes. About seven or eight people.

438
00:29:51,818 --> 00:29:54,340
Please reserve a room for me.

439
00:29:54,340 --> 00:29:58,179
Yeah, put it on my tab. Thanks.

440
00:29:58,179 --> 00:30:00,878
Chief Chen, I've reserved a room for you.

441
00:30:00,920 --> 00:30:02,780
You can go there directly later.

442
00:30:02,780 --> 00:30:04,460
Won't you come with us?

443
00:30:04,460 --> 00:30:05,940
I've got things to do tonight.

444
00:30:05,940 --> 00:30:07,078
All right, then.

445
00:30:07,079 --> 00:30:09,679
Thank you for showing up today.

446
00:30:09,680 --> 00:30:11,139
My pleasure.

447
00:30:13,199 --> 00:30:14,580
Where is Dr. Ye?

448
00:30:14,580 --> 00:30:17,518
She said she wasn't feeling well. She just left.

449
00:30:23,099 --> 00:30:25,300
Okay. Thank you for your hard work today.

450
00:30:25,300 --> 00:30:27,819
Have some good food tonight. I'm leaving now.

451
00:30:27,819 --> 00:30:30,639
- Thank you, President.
- Bye-bye.

452
00:30:32,119 --> 00:30:33,519
Don't stand still, let's go.

453
00:30:33,520 --> 00:30:35,739
- Let's go.
- Go.

454
00:30:59,239 --> 00:31:00,800
Ye Shilan!

455
00:31:02,239 --> 00:31:03,379
President?

456
00:31:03,379 --> 00:31:04,879
Where do you live?

457
00:31:04,879 --> 00:31:07,060
Hubin Shoufu Community.

458
00:31:07,060 --> 00:31:09,139
Get in the car. I'll take you home.

459
00:31:09,139 --> 00:31:11,418
No, thank you. I'll take the bus.

460
00:31:11,418 --> 00:31:13,879
I can't stop here for long. Come on.

461
00:31:14,719 --> 00:31:16,460
Thank you, then.

462
00:31:19,820 --> 00:31:21,318
Really treating me as a driver?

463
00:31:21,319 --> 00:31:23,119
Sit in the front.

464
00:31:44,199 --> 00:31:46,900
Why didn't you have dinner with your colleagues?

465
00:31:46,900 --> 00:31:48,599
I'm not hungry.

466
00:31:49,280 --> 00:31:51,840
Your relationship with them is not close, right?

467
00:31:59,079 --> 00:32:01,540
You can eat your hamburger. Don't waste it.

468
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:12,320
Do you know the last name of the big boss of Anxing Group?

469
00:32:13,079 --> 00:32:15,960
Lu. He is your father.

470
00:32:15,960 --> 00:32:18,318
When you knew that my last name is Lu,

471
00:32:18,319 --> 00:32:21,339
how come you never suspected my identity?

472
00:32:21,339 --> 00:32:23,159
Actually, I just heard about it today.

473
00:32:23,160 --> 00:32:26,239
The colleagues talked about it.

474
00:32:26,239 --> 00:32:28,139
What were they saying about me?

475
00:32:29,719 --> 00:32:33,280
My relationship with my colleagues is not so close.

476
00:32:33,280 --> 00:32:35,459
I didn't hear anything useful either.

477
00:32:45,800 --> 00:32:48,060
You don't like the smell in your car, do you?

478
00:32:48,979 --> 00:32:50,499
That's not true.

479
00:32:50,499 --> 00:32:52,318
Now the smell of chicken

480
00:32:52,319 --> 00:32:55,639
reminds me of cleaning up chicken manure in Taoyuan Village.

481
00:32:55,700 --> 00:32:59,400
You sentenced me to reform through labor and start a new life.

482
00:32:59,420 --> 00:33:02,498
Sorry. It's my fault.

483
00:33:03,739 --> 00:33:05,060
It's okay.

484
00:33:05,060 --> 00:33:07,400
I keep everything in mind.

485
00:33:15,479 --> 00:33:17,840
Don't choke on it.

486
00:33:17,840 --> 00:33:19,299
I won't.

487
00:33:20,339 --> 00:33:23,739
Will eating burgers make you feel better?

488
00:33:23,739 --> 00:33:26,019
I am not in a bad mood.

489
00:33:27,640 --> 00:33:30,430
It seems that you like to pretend you're okay.

490
00:33:42,160 --> 00:33:46,679
<i>Took a day off. I got stuck in writing. The potato chips are gone.</i>

491
00:33:46,719 --> 00:33:47,838
<i>Where are you now?</i>

492
00:33:47,839 --> 00:33:50,540
<i>Want to go to the convenience store or not?</i>

493
00:33:50,540 --> 00:33:51,999
<i>I need another fifteen minutes.</i>

494
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:54,439
<i>Get dressed and come downstairs.</i>

495
00:34:02,280 --> 00:34:04,099
Sorry.

496
00:34:04,099 --> 00:34:06,119
Is it your friend?

497
00:34:07,119 --> 00:34:08,139
My bestie.

498
00:34:08,139 --> 00:34:11,279
You don't seem to like making friends with co-workers, do you?

499
00:34:11,279 --> 00:34:13,099
Why do you say that?

500
00:34:13,099 --> 00:34:16,778
Otherwise, you should have known the gossip about changing the hospital's president.

501
00:34:18,159 --> 00:34:21,539
Colleagues don't necessarily have to be friends.

502
00:34:21,539 --> 00:34:23,390
And...

503
00:34:24,850 --> 00:34:28,199
And it's true that I'm not in a private chat group with my colleagues.

504
00:34:28,199 --> 00:34:29,780
Why?

505
00:34:30,360 --> 00:34:33,779
They rant and discuss every day.

506
00:34:33,779 --> 00:34:35,379
It affects my mood.

507
00:34:35,379 --> 00:34:37,500
About Chief Huang?

508
00:34:39,600 --> 00:34:41,859
It's all trivial now.

509
00:34:41,859 --> 00:34:43,619
I've forgotten it all.

510
00:34:44,220 --> 00:34:47,779
President, please stop next to the supermarket.

511
00:34:48,520 --> 00:34:50,020
Okay.

512
00:35:00,360 --> 00:35:02,459
Come on. I'm so hungry.

513
00:35:28,080 --> 00:35:30,398
I thought I could avoid him.

514
00:35:30,399 --> 00:35:33,420
But I spent most of the day with him.

515
00:35:33,420 --> 00:35:36,900
President's car. You don't like it?

516
00:35:36,900 --> 00:35:38,238
Don't be so ungrateful.

517
00:35:38,239 --> 00:35:39,859
Shut up.

518
00:35:39,859 --> 00:35:41,119
You know what?

519
00:35:41,120 --> 00:35:43,119
You should go for that free meal.

520
00:35:43,120 --> 00:35:46,259
As long as you are not embarrassed, the embarrassment is for others.

521
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:49,478
Are you still in love with that guy?

522
00:35:49,479 --> 00:35:51,180
What are you talking about?

523
00:35:51,180 --> 00:35:53,379
I thought President Lu would go.

524
00:35:53,379 --> 00:35:55,198
Are you so afraid of him?

525
00:35:55,199 --> 00:35:59,420
Didn't you say this afternoon that Lu Zhaoxi has some charisma?

526
00:35:59,420 --> 00:36:02,420
This is the most terrifying thing about him.

527
00:36:02,420 --> 00:36:05,279
According to his performance at the event site,

528
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:06,940
anyone would say that

529
00:36:06,940 --> 00:36:11,079
he is an understanding, empathetic, and determined gentleman.

530
00:36:11,080 --> 00:36:12,859
That's a lot of advantages.

531
00:36:12,859 --> 00:36:14,920
Even I was impressed.

532
00:36:15,700 --> 00:36:17,500
I get it.

533
00:36:18,420 --> 00:36:22,260
You're afraid that you'll fall for him, but he hates you.

534
00:36:23,139 --> 00:36:26,220
Masochism is indeed horrible.

535
00:36:26,919 --> 00:36:30,740
Is there something else besides love in your head?

536
00:36:30,740 --> 00:36:35,919
I think sunshine and darkness co-exist.

537
00:36:35,919 --> 00:36:38,180
He is so bright outside.

538
00:36:38,180 --> 00:36:40,999
But he leaves the dark side to me.

539
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:42,359
How scary is that?

540
00:36:42,360 --> 00:36:45,020
I simply met my nemesis.

541
00:36:45,020 --> 00:36:46,918
You're too pessimistic.

542
00:36:46,919 --> 00:36:48,760
Didn't you tell me that Chief Huang didn't arrange your schedule,

543
00:36:48,760 --> 00:36:50,940
so it was Lu Zhaoxi who transferred you back?

544
00:36:50,940 --> 00:36:53,379
He is your savior, right?

545
00:36:53,379 --> 00:36:55,539
Why did he give me a schedule?

546
00:36:55,539 --> 00:36:58,619
We are two individuals, yet we both have to be together once the festival is over.

547
00:36:58,619 --> 00:37:02,298
He always reminds me from time to time of the mistakes I made in Taoyuan Village.

548
00:37:02,298 --> 00:37:05,339
He often inquires about the things that happen in the hospital.

549
00:37:05,339 --> 00:37:06,759
So when I'm with him,

550
00:37:06,760 --> 00:37:10,059
I have to be totally focused at all times.

551
00:37:10,059 --> 00:37:11,940
And look at his face.

552
00:37:11,940 --> 00:37:15,999
It feels like he taking revenge on me, tormenting me for pleasure.

553
00:37:15,999 --> 00:37:18,560
He is the devil!

554
00:37:18,560 --> 00:37:20,579
Dr. Ye!

555
00:37:22,879 --> 00:37:25,519
You left your bag in the devil's car.

556
00:37:29,479 --> 00:37:31,700
Thank you, President.

557
00:37:32,879 --> 00:37:35,180
Is this the face of the devil?

558
00:37:40,840 --> 00:37:43,779
It doesn't matter anyway. You owe me enough already.

559
00:37:43,779 --> 00:37:45,660
I am cool with that.

560
00:37:45,660 --> 00:37:48,580
Bye. See you later.

561
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:54,358
I have said before that Lu Zhaoxi must be very handsome. You still wouldn't admit it.

562
00:37:54,358 --> 00:37:56,119
Yezi, don't be depressed.

563
00:37:56,120 --> 00:37:58,139
No harm has been done.

564
00:37:58,139 --> 00:38:02,819
If I die for a handsome man, it will be a worthy death.

565
00:38:02,819 --> 00:38:04,999
What handsome man?

566
00:38:04,999 --> 00:38:07,500
He is obviously a piranha!

567
00:38:13,460 --> 00:38:15,260
Devil?

568
00:38:15,260 --> 00:38:17,220
Not bad.

569
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:40,739
Welcome. What would you like to drink?

570
00:38:41,600 --> 00:38:42,859
Medium strawberry smoothie.

571
00:38:42,859 --> 00:38:44,339
Just help me pour it inside.

572
00:38:44,339 --> 00:38:46,500
Sure. Do you need anything else?

573
00:38:46,500 --> 00:38:47,579
No, thank you.

574
00:38:47,579 --> 00:38:49,799
- Please scan the code here.
- Okay.

575
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:58,239
- Here is your receipt.
- Thank you.

576
00:38:58,959 --> 00:39:01,000
Qi, I'll do it.

577
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:02,539
Okay.

578
00:39:31,199 --> 00:39:32,719
Hello, Miss. Do you have band-aids?

579
00:39:32,719 --> 00:39:34,220
My kid accidentally cut his hand.

580
00:39:34,220 --> 00:39:36,560
Band-aid. I'll look for one.

581
00:39:38,399 --> 00:39:39,539
Sorry but no.

582
00:39:39,539 --> 00:39:40,779
Is there a pharmacy around here?

583
00:39:40,779 --> 00:39:42,839
Hello, I have a band-aid.

584
00:39:42,840 --> 00:39:43,819
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

585
00:39:43,819 --> 00:39:45,439
Thank you.

586
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:52,020
Hello. Here is your strawberry smoothie.

587
00:39:52,020 --> 00:39:53,579
Thank you.

588
00:40:04,080 --> 00:40:06,478
Kevin always carries band-aids.

589
00:40:06,479 --> 00:40:10,059
He is a man with a broken heart.

590
00:40:12,479 --> 00:40:15,260
My villain is a little richer.

591
00:40:15,260 --> 00:40:16,701
Hello. What would you like to drink?

592
00:40:16,701 --> 00:40:18,930
- A hot latte, please.
- Okay.

593
00:40:18,930 --> 00:40:21,330
<i>[Outpatient]</i>

594
00:40:25,080 --> 00:40:26,679
Your kid's fever has gone down, right?

595
00:40:26,679 --> 00:40:28,540
Okay, it's good.

596
00:40:28,540 --> 00:40:31,439
Yes, that drug can be stopped.

597
00:40:32,040 --> 00:40:33,559
Your kid will develop his own immunity.

598
00:40:33,560 --> 00:40:36,260
So as to say... yes.

599
00:40:39,320 --> 00:40:40,359
Really? Okay.

600
00:40:40,360 --> 00:40:42,640
You're welcome, bye.

601
00:41:00,020 --> 00:41:02,439
You're working for Chief Huang.

602
00:41:04,399 --> 00:41:05,800
Pretty good.

603
00:41:06,360 --> 00:41:08,059
If you had done this earlier,

604
00:41:08,059 --> 00:41:11,880
you probably wouldn't have needed to stay in Taoyuan Village for so long.

605
00:41:14,199 --> 00:41:17,279
Are you educating me or laughing at me?
