<i>[Hi Venus]</i>

15
00:01:27,180 --> 00:01:29,952
<i>[Episode 02]</i>

16
00:01:32,419 --> 00:01:37,980
Look, we already have Vice President Gao, a layman, as our leader.

17
00:01:37,980 --> 00:01:40,680
As a result, now we have another.

18
00:01:41,479 --> 00:01:45,800
About that, shall we tell Old President Lu that the crown prince didn't show up?

19
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:47,400
No need.

20
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:49,539
He didn't even attend the inauguration.

21
00:01:49,539 --> 00:01:51,616
He just occupied a seat.

22
00:01:51,616 --> 00:01:53,580
He used to study finance.

23
00:01:53,580 --> 00:01:55,880
It has nothing to do with our hospital.

24
00:01:55,880 --> 00:01:58,779
He became a president, but he knows nothing.

25
00:01:58,779 --> 00:02:02,539
By the way, it is well known that before Old Xu left,

26
00:02:02,539 --> 00:02:04,620
he recommended you as his successor.

27
00:02:04,620 --> 00:02:08,611
Tell me what Old President Lu was thinking.

28
00:02:08,611 --> 00:02:11,263
Patients come here to see the doctors.

29
00:02:11,263 --> 00:02:13,720
Whether he comes or not, the hospital will still run well.

30
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:16,160
What do you think Old President Lu is always thinking?

31
00:02:16,900 --> 00:02:21,803
He just wants to make his resume look better when he joins the group.

32
00:02:21,803 --> 00:02:26,220
Anxing, compared with the whole medical group, is just a pool.

33
00:02:26,220 --> 00:02:28,060
It can't keep him forever.

34
00:02:28,060 --> 00:02:32,055
Isn't it equivalent to him using you as a stepping stone?

35
00:02:34,099 --> 00:02:36,060
If he wants to cross the river,

36
00:02:36,060 --> 00:02:38,980
he should pay attention to whether I'll make trouble.

37
00:02:38,980 --> 00:02:40,380
Yes.

38
00:02:41,379 --> 00:02:44,015
<i>Be careful, Granny Fang.</i>

39
00:02:44,939 --> 00:02:48,579
Take care. Don't catch a cold.

40
00:02:48,579 --> 00:02:50,000
Slow down.

41
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,560
Got it.

42
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:52,919
Go on with your work.

43
00:02:52,919 --> 00:02:55,221
Okay. Take care, Granny Fang.

44
00:03:22,759 --> 00:03:24,167
Have some lunch.

45
00:03:24,167 --> 00:03:29,272
Ye, no matter what happened, let him have a meal.

46
00:03:29,272 --> 00:03:31,184
We don't run a hotel.

47
00:03:31,184 --> 00:03:33,000
The road is blocked now.

48
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,939
No signal here. There's no village or hotel around.

49
00:03:35,939 --> 00:03:38,367
Don't make him starve.

50
00:03:40,479 --> 00:03:43,856
Lu, come and have some lunch.

51
00:03:45,090 --> 00:03:47,040
- Come on.
- Let me do it.

52
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:48,830
Hurry up and eat.

53
00:04:01,620 --> 00:04:05,620
It's your last chance. Tell me the truth.

54
00:04:05,620 --> 00:04:08,319
Are you the president of Anxing Hospital?

55
00:04:08,819 --> 00:04:10,419
You're not.

56
00:04:10,419 --> 00:04:12,884
Do you know why I know you're not?

57
00:04:12,884 --> 00:04:16,060
Because I, Ye Shilan,

58
00:04:16,060 --> 00:04:19,583
am a pediatrician at Anxing Hospital.

59
00:04:26,139 --> 00:04:29,000
You're a doctor there?

60
00:04:30,979 --> 00:04:33,199
Then, why are you here?

61
00:04:34,100 --> 00:04:37,587
If you're the president, why don't you know it?

62
00:04:37,587 --> 00:04:40,139
It is Anxing Hospital's public welfare project.

63
00:04:40,139 --> 00:04:42,280
There are few people in some villages here,

64
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:44,680
most of whom are the elderly and children.

65
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:47,259
The conditions and personnel of the clinic are limited.

66
00:04:47,259 --> 00:04:50,563
So we were asked to give medical aid.

67
00:04:50,563 --> 00:04:54,160
One of us must be lying.

68
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:56,440
But I don't need to prove my identity to you.

69
00:04:56,440 --> 00:04:58,670
Believe it or not.

70
00:05:01,419 --> 00:05:03,419
I believe.

71
00:05:03,419 --> 00:05:05,728
You're still calm.

72
00:05:05,728 --> 00:05:09,239
Your face must have been soaked in wine.

73
00:05:09,239 --> 00:05:11,760
You said you're a doctor in Anxing.

74
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:14,259
You must know Anxing Hospital very well.

75
00:05:14,259 --> 00:05:15,959
Of course.

76
00:05:19,540 --> 00:05:20,860
What do you mean?

77
00:05:20,860 --> 00:05:22,879
Literal meaning.

78
00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:26,200
Have lunch!

79
00:05:27,859 --> 00:05:29,503
I don't eat leftovers!

80
00:05:29,503 --> 00:05:32,300
Eat or not, I don't care if you starve.

81
00:05:39,100 --> 00:05:41,119
You're an unscrupulous drug dealer.

82
00:05:41,119 --> 00:05:44,460
You are so picky. Just starve.

83
00:06:03,619 --> 00:06:06,720
Who let you eat it? My last instant noodles.

84
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:09,700
Yummy. Let's keep accounts.

85
00:06:09,700 --> 00:06:12,280
Are you addicted to writing bad checks?

86
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:15,892
What if it comes true?

87
00:06:17,179 --> 00:06:18,779
Okay.

88
00:06:19,359 --> 00:06:21,059
Write it down.

89
00:06:27,780 --> 00:06:31,840
On March 5th, two cups of coffee for Director Huang, 66 yuan.

90
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:34,112
He is your leader.

91
00:06:34,112 --> 00:06:35,859
How dare you take such accounts?

92
00:06:35,859 --> 00:06:38,060
It's natural to pay debts.

93
00:06:38,060 --> 00:06:40,239
Director Huang's salary is not low.

94
00:06:40,239 --> 00:06:42,000
Why does he like taking advantage of you?

95
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,180
It's not the case.

96
00:06:44,180 --> 00:06:47,759
He likes to be flattered by his subordinates.

97
00:06:47,759 --> 00:06:50,150
Are there many leaders like him in Anxing?

98
00:06:50,150 --> 00:06:52,520
None of your business.

99
00:06:52,520 --> 00:06:54,460
Why not write it down?

100
00:06:54,460 --> 00:06:56,648
Of course I will.

101
00:06:58,540 --> 00:07:00,220
I'll give you a boxful of instant noodles, okay?

102
00:07:00,220 --> 00:07:02,359
Not enough. I want ten.

103
00:07:02,359 --> 00:07:04,787
Okay, that's a deal.

104
00:07:10,579 --> 00:07:13,519
Who is eating instant noodles? Give me one.

105
00:07:13,519 --> 00:07:15,510
It's the last one.

106
00:07:16,639 --> 00:07:19,320
One bucket for ten boxes. Check it.

107
00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:21,048
Ten boxes?

108
00:07:21,048 --> 00:07:23,060
Ye, you're too greedy!

109
00:07:23,060 --> 00:07:24,640
Do you think he will pay me back?

110
00:07:24,640 --> 00:07:26,820
If not, the note will be useless.

111
00:07:26,820 --> 00:07:29,459
We don't have any other entertainment on the mountain.

112
00:07:29,459 --> 00:07:32,819
Now we have met you, a drama king, for entertainment.

113
00:07:33,259 --> 00:07:36,579
Go away after eating. Take away the trash.

114
00:07:36,579 --> 00:07:38,640
I'm going to work.

115
00:07:42,459 --> 00:07:44,259
Lu Zhaoxi.

116
00:07:45,419 --> 00:07:48,159
I mean for you to leave the clinic.

117
00:07:48,159 --> 00:07:50,401
No way! The road is still blocked. Where can he go?

118
00:07:50,401 --> 00:07:52,220
He can go anywhere he wants.

119
00:07:52,220 --> 00:07:53,780
There's a village ahead.

120
00:07:53,780 --> 00:07:56,983
What if he cheats the elderly there?

121
00:07:59,259 --> 00:08:01,019
You don't want me to entertain you?

122
00:08:01,019 --> 00:08:02,299
I'm bored.

123
00:08:02,299 --> 00:08:04,961
Yes. It's meaningless to write IOUs.

124
00:08:04,961 --> 00:08:08,606
You'd better let him work for you for a living.

125
00:08:08,606 --> 00:08:10,320
Can he?

126
00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:13,320
I can have a try.

127
00:08:30,519 --> 00:08:32,919
What are you still doing?

128
00:08:32,919 --> 00:08:35,280
There is rice bran behind you.

129
00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:39,363
Scoop two bowls and stir well.

130
00:09:16,900 --> 00:09:19,900
Are you going to work by holding your breath?

131
00:09:19,900 --> 00:09:21,100
Anything else?

132
00:09:21,100 --> 00:09:23,659
A lot of things. One by one.

133
00:09:23,659 --> 00:09:25,560
Clean the duck shed first.

134
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:28,559
Dump the manure into the vegetable field in the back.

135
00:09:31,819 --> 00:09:35,379
The elderly here earn money by raising ducks and farming land.

136
00:09:35,379 --> 00:09:37,479
But you cheat them.

137
00:09:37,479 --> 00:09:39,519
Just treat it as labor reform.

138
00:09:39,519 --> 00:09:42,724
If you regret it, you can leave.

139
00:09:43,860 --> 00:09:46,516
It's fair to trade labor for food.

140
00:09:46,516 --> 00:09:48,710
I'm just worried that you'll regret it.

141
00:09:48,710 --> 00:09:50,920
Don't worry about it.

142
00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:52,940
Work hard.

143
00:10:31,220 --> 00:10:35,180
Vomit in the toilet or you'll have to clean it up.

144
00:10:35,740 --> 00:10:38,800
No need to supervise me. I won't be lazy.

145
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:40,760
I don't care about you.

146
00:10:40,760 --> 00:10:42,280
Take it.

00:14:54,346 --> 00:14:57,300
How about a chicken house or a sheepfold?

208

I have to remind you the temperature difference here is great.

You may catch a cold.

212
00:15:18,900 --> 00:15:21,071
You're a doctor. Who else can I turn to?

213
00:15:21,071 --> 00:15:25,320
Apart from you, I'll report to Chief Huang.

214
00:15:26,499 --> 00:15:28,179
Where will you find him?

215
00:15:28,179 --> 00:15:30,619
You're a pediatrician at Anxing Hospital.

216
00:15:30,619 --> 00:15:33,908
He must be the Chief of Pediatrics.

217
00:15:35,139 --> 00:15:37,710
I should warn you. Don't spread rumors.

218
00:15:37,710 --> 00:15:42,919
Deputy Director told me that you voluntarily applied for medical aid here for three months.

219
00:15:42,919 --> 00:15:45,000
It's been over half a year.

220
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:50,200
You write your work report carefully every month to be transferred back, but in vain.

221
00:15:50,220 --> 00:15:54,016
Chief Huang must not like subordinates like you.

222
00:15:57,259 --> 00:15:59,760
Why are you asking about these things?

223
00:15:59,760 --> 00:16:03,020
If you know yourself and your enemy, you won't be so passive.

224
00:16:03,020 --> 00:16:05,259
I can't sleep in the IV room.

225
00:16:05,259 --> 00:16:07,399
I have to work tomorrow.

226
00:16:09,640 --> 00:16:12,384
The same as before. 2,000 yuan per night.

227
00:16:12,384 --> 00:16:14,127
I won't renege.

228
00:16:15,220 --> 00:16:17,736
If you want to sleep in my room,

229
00:16:17,736 --> 00:16:20,639
you must promise me one condition.

230
00:16:30,940 --> 00:16:33,268
Wake up. Time for work.

231
00:16:37,559 --> 00:16:40,679
Medicinal Wine Lu, get up and work.

232
00:16:52,860 --> 00:16:54,340
What's the matter?

233
00:16:55,100 --> 00:16:57,184
Where were you?

234
00:16:57,184 --> 00:16:59,039
What's wrong?

235
00:16:59,039 --> 00:17:00,820
- Have you fed chickens and goats?
- Yes.

236
00:17:00,820 --> 00:17:02,660
- Sweep the floor.
- Done.

237
00:17:02,660 --> 00:17:04,160
Well...

238
00:17:05,019 --> 00:17:08,771
Deputy Director said he was hungry and felt dizzy.

239
00:17:09,900 --> 00:17:11,900
I'll cook breakfast.

240
00:17:14,700 --> 00:17:16,940
Come to have some later.

241
00:17:29,079 --> 00:17:32,684
Lu is great. He got up early to work.

242
00:17:32,684 --> 00:17:35,620
I had no choice. No work, no food.

243
00:17:35,620 --> 00:17:36,859
Keep it in mind.

244
00:17:36,859 --> 00:17:38,099
Come on.

245
00:17:38,099 --> 00:17:40,816
Leader, thank you for your food.

246
00:17:40,816 --> 00:17:42,444
Who's your leader?

247
00:17:43,319 --> 00:17:46,819
Ye, Lu is also single.

248
00:17:47,660 --> 00:17:49,960
It's not my business.

249
00:17:49,960 --> 00:17:51,979
Lu lives in town.

250
00:17:51,979 --> 00:17:56,019
You can contact him after you return to Anxing Hospital and make friends, right?

251
00:17:56,019 --> 00:17:57,180
I don't lack friends.

252
00:17:57,180 --> 00:17:59,800
She's worried that she won't go back.

253
00:18:00,619 --> 00:18:02,624
Don't curse me.

254
00:18:03,839 --> 00:18:06,180
Deputy Director, don't tell him everything.

255
00:18:06,180 --> 00:18:07,560
He's full of evil ideas.

256
00:18:07,560 --> 00:18:09,000
He is also looking after you.

257
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,880
No. He is a liar.

258
00:18:14,360 --> 00:18:18,100
Doctor Ye, how did you offend Chief Huang?

259
00:18:18,100 --> 00:18:19,920
He just won't transfer you back.

260
00:18:19,920 --> 00:18:21,664
What do you want?

261
00:18:21,664 --> 00:18:23,339
I want to help you.

262
00:18:23,339 --> 00:18:25,900
We must know the reason to help you solve the problem.

263
00:18:25,900 --> 00:18:28,239
Think it over. Here are three leaders.

264
00:18:28,239 --> 00:18:30,199
Two heads are better than one.

265
00:18:30,199 --> 00:18:32,399
2 directors, 1 president.

266
00:18:32,399 --> 00:18:34,420
Tell us.

267
00:18:34,420 --> 00:18:37,879
You just won't forget to include yourself as a fake president.

268
00:18:37,879 --> 00:18:40,167
What if it comes true?

269
00:18:40,167 --> 00:18:43,768
Director, look. Lu is thoughtful.

270
00:18:43,768 --> 00:18:45,940
We both failed in our duties.

271
00:18:45,940 --> 00:18:50,019
We know you're in trouble but never asked the reason or thought of ideas for her.

272
00:18:50,019 --> 00:18:51,980
Yes. Ye, tell us.

273
00:18:51,980 --> 00:18:54,976
How did you offend Chief Huang?

274
00:19:01,619 --> 00:19:02,900
<i>Do you have any packages for me?</i>

275
00:19:02,900 --> 00:19:04,140
<i>Yes, Doctor Ye.</i>

276
00:19:04,140 --> 00:19:06,039
<i>- Thanks.
- You're welcome.</i>

277
00:19:14,460 --> 00:19:16,400
<i>Take the baby for a recheck next Wednesday.</i>

278
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:17,300
<i>Okay. Thank you, doctor.</i>

279
00:19:17,300 --> 00:19:18,439
<i>You're welcome. Take care.</i>

280
00:19:18,439 --> 00:19:19,739
<i>Bye-bye.</i>

281
00:19:31,560 --> 00:19:33,160
<i>Thank you.</i>

282
00:19:39,060 --> 00:19:41,660
<i>I have seen you sitting here for several days.</i>

283
00:19:41,660 --> 00:19:44,639
<i>Did you go to other hospitals to ask?</i>

284
00:19:44,639 --> 00:19:46,460
<i>Yes.</i>

285
00:19:46,460 --> 00:19:48,800
<i>They all persuaded us to give up.</i>

286
00:19:49,900 --> 00:19:54,807
<i>I heard that Associate Dean Xu successfully performed such an operation.</i>

287
00:19:56,060 --> 00:19:59,680
<i>Each patient's situation is different.</i>

288
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:03,728
<i>Maybe the success rate is too low.</i>

289
00:20:04,359 --> 00:20:06,720
<i>Even if the rate is 0.0001,</i>

290
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:09,127
<i>it is worth trying.</i>

291
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:12,728
<i>He wants to live.</i>

292
00:20:14,219 --> 00:20:16,455
<i>We fought for him.</i>

293
00:20:17,420 --> 00:20:19,320
<i>That's enough.</i>

294
00:20:22,619 --> 00:20:27,220
<i>President Gao, I found that the operation's success rate is very low.</i>

295
00:20:27,220 --> 00:20:29,444
<i>But there are cases of recovery.</i>

296
00:20:29,444 --> 00:20:32,480
<i>Besides, the family also wants to try it.</i>

297
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:36,900
<i>I'm not a medical student.</i>

298
00:20:36,900 --> 00:20:39,219
<i>I don't understand what you are telling me.</i>

299
00:20:39,219 --> 00:20:43,219
<i>But Cardio-Thoracic Surgery has rejected the patient's family.</i>

300
00:20:43,219 --> 00:20:45,648
<i>In this case,</i>

301
00:20:46,060 --> 00:20:48,324
<i>it's useless for you to ask me.</i>

302
00:20:48,324 --> 00:20:51,188
<i>Dean Xu has had successful cases before.</i>

303
00:20:51,188 --> 00:20:54,651
<i>But he went abroad to attend exchange meetings.</i>

304
00:20:54,651 --> 00:20:57,839
<i>- I don't know...
- Wait.</i>

305
00:20:57,839 --> 00:21:00,859
<i>You said Dean Xu had such an operation?</i>

306
00:21:00,859 --> 00:21:02,060
<i>Yes.</i>

307
00:21:02,060 --> 00:21:04,460
<i>Here are the successful cases.</i>

308
00:21:10,139 --> 00:21:12,888
<i>Are you Dr. Ye from Pediatrics?</i>

309
00:21:12,888 --> 00:21:14,780
<i>Your name is familiar to me.</i>

310
00:21:14,780 --> 00:21:17,540
<i>I saw it on the medical aid list.</i>

311
00:21:17,540 --> 00:21:19,240
<i>Yes.</i>

312
00:21:19,240 --> 00:21:21,160
<i>I have an idea.</i>

313
00:21:21,160 --> 00:21:24,800
<i>Go to the Inpatient Department to go through the process and let the patient stay in the hospital first.</i>

314
00:21:24,800 --> 00:21:26,540
<i>Tell them it's my order.</i>

315
00:21:27,300 --> 00:21:31,119
<i>Well... on Dean Xu's side...
- Since there is hope,</i>

316
00:21:31,119 --> 00:21:34,040
<i>we can't give up, can we?</i>

317
00:21:34,040 --> 00:21:36,540
<i>I'll tell Dean Xu.</i>

318
00:21:36,540 --> 00:21:37,960
<i>Okay!</i>

319
00:21:37,960 --> 00:21:39,361
<i>Thank you, President Gao.</i>

320
00:21:39,361 --> 00:21:41,664
<i>- Not at all.
- I shall leave.</i>

321
00:21:41,664 --> 00:21:45,060
<i>Ye Shilan. You are a pediatrician.</i>

322
00:21:45,060 --> 00:21:47,399
<i>Why are you involved in Cardio-Thoracic Surgery?</i>

323
00:21:47,399 --> 00:21:49,999
<i>You even turned directly to President Gao.</i>

324
00:21:49,999 --> 00:21:51,460
<i>You...</i>

325
00:21:51,460 --> 00:21:53,830
<i>Why won't other hospitals accept him?</i>

326
00:21:53,830 --> 00:21:55,700
<i>Why won't Cardio-Thoracic Surgery accept him?</i>

327
00:21:55,700 --> 00:21:58,199
<i>Can't they contact Dean Xu?</i>

328
00:21:58,199 --> 00:22:00,620
<i>Are you mad?</i>

329
00:22:00,620 --> 00:22:04,520
<i>You can only pray for miracles now.</i>

330
00:22:46,619 --> 00:22:50,580
<i>Ye Shilan, you'll go to Taoyuan Village for medical aid next Monday.</i>

331
00:22:50,580 --> 00:22:54,980
<i>Work seriously. Reflect on yourself when you are free.</i>

332
00:23:20,739 --> 00:23:23,588
Do you regret your meddling?

333
00:23:24,319 --> 00:23:25,628
I do.

334
00:23:25,628 --> 00:23:28,348
I regret that I was too naive.

335
00:23:28,348 --> 00:23:30,575
Empty words.

336
00:23:31,680 --> 00:23:34,460
Everyone needs to be meddled with sometimes.

337
00:23:34,460 --> 00:23:37,840
At least the mother will thank you in her heart.

338
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:43,907
Your moral sense is unsteady.

339
00:23:45,859 --> 00:23:47,420
Clean the bowls.

340
00:23:47,420 --> 00:23:50,720
Don't forget what you promised me last night.

341
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:52,845
Is this necessary?

342
00:23:52,845 --> 00:23:55,180
Do you want to sleep in the IV room?

343
00:24:11,599 --> 00:24:14,299
Are you ready? Start.

344
00:24:15,599 --> 00:24:16,899
Okay.

345
00:24:17,499 --> 00:24:21,580
I, Lu Zhaoxi, hereby promise not to sell fake medicinal liquor anymore.

346
00:24:21,580 --> 00:24:24,476
Look at the camera. Put your hand down.

347
00:24:29,499 --> 00:24:33,204
I, Lu Zhaoxi, hereby promise

348
00:24:33,204 --> 00:24:35,479
not to sell fake medicinal liquor anymore.

349
00:24:35,479 --> 00:24:37,959
If I do it again, the photographer Ye Shilan

350
00:24:37,959 --> 00:24:43,276
has the right to make the video public and report it to the police.

351
00:24:43,276 --> 00:24:45,536
Okay.

352
00:24:46,160 --> 00:24:48,000
Don't scold me in your heart.

353
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:50,432
I'm saving a young offender.

354
00:24:50,432 --> 00:24:52,079
Go back and find a job.

355
00:24:52,079 --> 00:24:55,659
You will have a bright future.

356
00:24:55,659 --> 00:24:57,360
Come on!

357
00:24:57,360 --> 00:24:59,120
I trust you.

360
00:25:44,099 --> 00:25:45,799
Director.

361
00:25:52,619 --> 00:25:54,319
Deputy Director.

362
00:26:02,479 --> 00:26:05,339
They forgot to turn off the lights again.

363
00:26:12,660 --> 00:26:14,699
Are you here to steal the wine?

364
00:26:14,699 --> 00:26:16,399
It's me.

365
00:26:16,900 --> 00:26:19,039
You scared me to death.

366
00:26:19,039 --> 00:26:21,784
Why don't you make a sound when you are here?

367
00:26:21,784 --> 00:26:23,579
You didn't call me.

368
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:26,460
Why are you here?

369
00:26:26,460 --> 00:26:28,480
I'm cleaning.

370
00:26:29,920 --> 00:26:32,139
Sweeping the floor and even wearing a mask.

371
00:26:32,139 --> 00:26:34,347
Hypocritical.

372
00:26:34,347 --> 00:26:37,080
Why can't I come and have a drink?

373
00:26:37,080 --> 00:26:40,100
Deputy Director just came to pick up a pot of wine.

374
00:26:40,100 --> 00:26:41,719
He asked me to keep it a secret.

375
00:26:41,719 --> 00:26:44,319
Help yourself. Lock the door when you leave.

376
00:26:44,319 --> 00:26:46,223
Take it easy.

377
00:26:48,119 --> 00:26:51,219
I don't know what your medicinal liquor is made of.

378
00:26:56,760 --> 00:27:02,135
These were made of valuable materials by Director Li.

379
00:27:03,079 --> 00:27:05,179
Would you like to try one?

380
00:27:06,359 --> 00:27:07,520
No, thanks.

381
00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:09,199
Have a bit.

382
00:27:09,199 --> 00:27:11,240
You'll sleep well.

383
00:27:15,099 --> 00:27:16,919
You don't hate me now?

384
00:27:18,139 --> 00:27:19,971
Everyone makes mistakes.

385
00:27:19,971 --> 00:27:21,979
It's good to correct them.

386
00:27:22,820 --> 00:27:26,247
Isn't it worth celebrating?

387
00:27:27,259 --> 00:27:29,750
You're afraid that I'll tell Director Li,

388
00:27:29,750 --> 00:27:32,070
so you want me to be your accomplice?

389
00:28:07,979 --> 00:28:10,359
Help yourself. Don't be polite.

390
00:28:18,280 --> 00:28:19,780
Have a taste.

391
00:28:32,300 --> 00:28:34,100
How about it?

392
00:28:34,100 --> 00:28:36,379
Has no flavor.

393
00:28:36,379 --> 00:28:38,247
I didn't lie to you, did I?

394
00:28:39,259 --> 00:28:43,303
Do you often drink alone?

395
00:28:43,303 --> 00:28:44,939
Not often.

396
00:28:44,939 --> 00:28:47,220
Just when I'm in a bad mood.

397
00:28:47,220 --> 00:28:49,643
So you are in a bad mood.

398
00:28:53,019 --> 00:28:56,119
Is it because you can't go back to Anxing Hospital?

399
00:29:02,259 --> 00:29:06,276
It's easy to get sick if you keep unhappiness in your mind.

400
00:29:07,599 --> 00:29:10,219
Since I took the video and I'm drinking with you,

401
00:29:10,219 --> 00:29:12,439
don't keep it from me.

402
00:29:17,780 --> 00:29:19,780
It's not called drinking.

403
00:29:30,060 --> 00:29:32,328
No need to bottoms up.

404
00:29:32,328 --> 00:29:34,907
This wine is very precious.

405
00:29:41,119 --> 00:29:46,980
Anyway, we may not meet again after you leave.

406
00:29:46,980 --> 00:29:49,540
It doesn't matter to tell you.

407
00:29:53,780 --> 00:29:56,040
You can take me as a tree hole.

408
00:29:58,460 --> 00:30:02,075
You already know the general situation.

409
00:30:03,940 --> 00:30:08,360
I voluntarily applied for medical aid in Taoyuan Village for three months.

410
00:30:09,400 --> 00:30:13,895
But I didn't expect to offend Chief Huang before leaving.

411
00:30:13,895 --> 00:30:16,859
I participate in remote assessments every month.

412
00:30:16,859 --> 00:30:18,459
I have good grades.

413
00:30:18,459 --> 00:30:23,576
In the report, the director and deputy director give good reviews.

414
00:30:23,576 --> 00:30:27,200
But the HR Department gives no notice.

415
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:29,127
So I am very upset.

416
00:30:30,619 --> 00:30:33,416
Your present life is also very good.

417
00:30:33,416 --> 00:30:36,900
This medical assistance is also a very meaningful thing.

418
00:30:36,900 --> 00:30:38,300
Yes, it is.

419
00:30:38,300 --> 00:30:40,451
So I came.

420
00:30:40,451 --> 00:30:42,900
But I also have my own life.

421
00:30:42,900 --> 00:30:45,660
I can't stay here all the time.

422
00:30:45,660 --> 00:30:48,452
It's like doing charity.

423
00:30:48,452 --> 00:30:51,299
Act according to your ability.

424
00:30:51,299 --> 00:30:53,460
You're enlightened.

425
00:30:56,880 --> 00:30:58,967
Maybe as you said,

426
00:30:58,967 --> 00:31:00,799
Chief Huang hates me

427
00:31:00,799 --> 00:31:03,940
and doesn't want to see me in front of him.

428
00:31:03,940 --> 00:31:06,040
If he doesn't agree,

429
00:31:06,839 --> 00:31:08,815
it's hard for me to go back.

430
00:31:08,815 --> 00:31:10,259
Come on.

431
00:31:17,680 --> 00:31:20,588
Don't be too pessimistic.

432
00:31:20,588 --> 00:31:22,227
You don't know.

433
00:31:22,959 --> 00:31:26,008
- I'm an unlucky person.
- Superstition.

434
00:31:26,008 --> 00:31:27,619
It's true.

435
00:31:27,619 --> 00:31:32,395
From my study of medicine to my work in Anxing Hospital,

436
00:31:33,199 --> 00:31:35,511
God has blessed me.

437
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:39,955
Maybe I don't deserve to have a good life.

438
00:31:45,580 --> 00:31:47,180
Don't worry.

439
00:31:47,180 --> 00:31:49,300
You can go back.

440
00:31:51,560 --> 00:31:53,611
For your blessing.

441
00:32:03,760 --> 00:32:06,540
But I don't understand one thing.

442
00:32:06,540 --> 00:32:09,040
You offended Dean Xu.

443
00:32:09,040 --> 00:32:12,564
Why was Chief Huang so angry?

444
00:32:15,680 --> 00:32:21,159
Chief Huang's nickname is Horse Leg Pioneer.

445
00:32:21,159 --> 00:32:24,592
He likes to cater to Dean Xu the most

446
00:32:24,592 --> 00:32:27,888
and follow his lead.

447
00:32:27,888 --> 00:32:31,139
This kind of thing doesn't need Dean Xu's instruction at all.

448
00:32:31,139 --> 00:32:33,939
Didn't President Gao defend you?

449
00:32:33,939 --> 00:32:35,599
I don't know.

450
00:32:35,599 --> 00:32:37,179
I am a little doctor.

451
00:32:37,179 --> 00:32:40,439
I'm not qualified to attend high-level meetings.

452
00:32:41,619 --> 00:32:45,540
By the way, this is my own fault.

453
00:32:45,540 --> 00:32:48,020
None of President Gao's business.

454
00:32:50,460 --> 00:32:54,475
Which of the two heads of the hospital do you hate more?

455
00:32:55,379 --> 00:32:57,579
Neither.

456
00:32:57,579 --> 00:33:00,643
President Gao is amiable and approachable.

457
00:33:00,643 --> 00:33:02,979
Dean Xu is a good doctor.

458
00:33:02,979 --> 00:33:04,979
I really admire him.

459
00:33:04,979 --> 00:33:08,440
Unluckily, your direct leader is Chief Huang.

460
00:33:08,440 --> 00:33:09,959
Yes.

461
00:33:09,959 --> 00:33:12,108
What bad luck!

462
00:33:13,660 --> 00:33:17,520
Chief Huang is good as a doctor.

463
00:33:17,520 --> 00:33:22,088
But as a leader, there are no words.

464
00:33:22,088 --> 00:33:24,695
Why not go to another hospital?

465
00:33:24,695 --> 00:33:26,560
The welfare of Anxing is good.

466
00:33:26,560 --> 00:33:28,719
After three years, you can apply for

467
00:33:28,719 --> 00:33:30,959
interest-free loans to buy a house.

468
00:33:30,959 --> 00:33:35,279
I have dreamed of having a house of my own since I was ten years old.

469
00:33:35,280 --> 00:33:37,168
So I can't go.

470
00:33:37,168 --> 00:33:40,132
Anyway, I have to stay.

471
00:33:42,259 --> 00:33:44,799
Don't mention these troubles.

472
00:33:46,820 --> 00:33:48,320
It's my turn.

473
00:34:02,599 --> 00:34:03,760
Have a taste.

474
00:34:03,760 --> 00:34:06,031
It's tasty. Help yourself.

475
00:34:06,760 --> 00:34:08,260
Have some.

476
00:34:08,260 --> 00:34:09,780
I know.

477
00:34:09,780 --> 00:34:11,900
You think it's dirty.

478
00:34:18,420 --> 00:34:21,980
But the wine tastes better and better.

479
00:34:21,980 --> 00:34:24,180
Yes.

480
00:34:24,180 --> 00:34:25,890
Are you a heavy drinker?

481
00:34:26,560 --> 00:34:28,160
Just so-so.

482
00:34:29,159 --> 00:34:30,660
You're modest.

483
00:34:30,660 --> 00:34:33,480
Come on. Cheers.

484
00:34:49,339 --> 00:34:51,320
There is also a snake?

485
00:34:51,320 --> 00:34:53,820
What is your medicinal liquor made of?

486
00:34:53,820 --> 00:34:56,624
I'm not a liquor dealer.

487
00:34:56,624 --> 00:34:58,864
You're a liar.

You're not modest at all.
