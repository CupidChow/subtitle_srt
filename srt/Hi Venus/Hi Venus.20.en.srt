Ye Shilan, didn't you say that you didn't regularly play this?

17
00:01:52,599 --> 00:01:53,818
Why would I lie to you?

18
00:01:53,818 --> 00:01:55,379
Then you have a gift for it.

19
00:01:55,379 --> 00:01:56,700
I am serious now.

20
00:01:56,700 --> 00:01:57,940
You should have been earlier.

21
00:01:57,940 --> 00:02:00,559
Fine. From now on,

22
00:02:00,559 --> 00:02:02,940
each game plays to 8 points. The winner wins two out of three games. What do you think?

23
00:02:02,940 --> 00:02:05,139
Deal. Come on.

- I won.
- Good job.

30
00:02:52,699 --> 00:02:55,018
But badminton is not what I'm good at.

31
00:02:55,018 --> 00:02:56,738
So is it your pride that makes you say so?

32
00:02:56,738 --> 00:02:58,479
What about this? I will be nicer to you.

33
00:02:58,479 --> 00:02:59,819
So you can have your pride back.

34

- Dr. Ye, was it match-fixing?

38

I won't do it again. Come on.

No, I can't. I can't even move anymore.

46
00:04:12,780 --> 00:04:14,680
Take a break there.

47
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:15,920
Sure.

48
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:18,320
I'm tired.

49
00:04:21,100 --> 00:04:23,698

00:04:25,380 --> 00:04:27,079
Thank you.

Drink it.

53
00:04:33,220 --> 00:04:35,559
Why did you play so hard?

54
00:04:40,039 --> 00:04:42,119
Slowly.

55
00:04:42,119 --> 00:04:44,000
I wanted to win.

56
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:47,720
I don't want to lose any chance to win.

57
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:50,100
I could tell after our first game

58
00:04:50,100 --> 00:04:52,760
you'd have no energy to keep fighting later.

59
00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:54,399
You're right.

60
00:04:54,399 --> 00:04:56,699
I don't exercise.

61
00:04:56,699 --> 00:05:00,119
So... does the winner get a prize?

62
00:05:00,900 --> 00:05:02,259
You didn't ask at the beginning.

63
00:05:02,259 --> 00:05:03,660
Isn't it a common rule?

64
00:05:03,660 --> 00:05:06,020
What do you want?

65
00:05:08,459 --> 00:05:11,579
What? My face is sweating.

66
00:05:11,579 --> 00:05:13,519
It's all right.

67
00:05:25,119 --> 00:05:26,558
What are you doing?

68
00:05:26,559 --> 00:05:29,959
Look at your blushed face. It's so cute that I want to hold it.

69
00:05:29,959 --> 00:05:32,959
No. It hurts.

70
00:05:33,699 --> 00:05:35,739
What did you think?

71
00:05:35,739 --> 00:05:39,520
If I kissed you, it'd be me giving you a prize.

72
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:43,158
Well, fine. I was overthinking.

73
00:05:44,039 --> 00:05:45,299
Do you want to play?

74
00:05:45,299 --> 00:05:46,659
Of course.

75
00:05:46,659 --> 00:05:49,658
I can't beat you with language, so I must win you with badminton.

76
00:05:50,459 --> 00:05:51,859
Well, calm down.

77
00:05:51,859 --> 00:05:54,320
No worries. I can do it.

I just estimated when you'd get off work, and came to see you.

89
00:06:54,939 --> 00:06:58,799
As a manager, you're really conscientious.

To relax?

94

Relax is just a part of it.

95
00:07:10,799 --> 00:07:12,819

Yes. That's what I do.

Anything else?

99
00:07:21,579 --> 00:07:25,078
Or just put on an act by myself, so I can feel inspired sometimes.

100

Let's go. To find your inspiration.

111
00:08:10,258 --> 00:08:12,700
No, your line should be...

112
00:08:13,979 --> 00:08:16,418
"If you don't use all 200 coins, tonight,

"So... will you be with me to sleep on the street?"

115

Yes, that's it. That's what I want. We can act with each other.

116
00:08:29,080 --> 00:08:30,660
In this way, I may feel something.

117

- Okay.
- Let's go.

"You will see."

125

Get off if you aren't going to use it. I want to play with it.

Just wait a moment.

127

"But we're surrounded by enemies.

129
00:09:13,498 --> 00:09:14,979
It's not safe to hide anymore."

Look the same. Look the same.

00:10:22,939 --> 00:10:25,080
Look the same.

"This... is the business empire I built for you.

Are you satisfied?"

"Your Majesty, where did you set up your booth?"

149
00:11:07,820 --> 00:11:09,120
"At the gate of the school."

"It's getting cold.

"Let Mrs. Wang close the booth early."

How did you do it? Tell me. Tell me.

157
00:11:54,519 --> 00:11:57,158
It's a feeling. You can give it a try.

158
00:12:00,379 --> 00:12:02,540
Left. Move forward.

159
00:12:02,540 --> 00:12:04,179
Good. Now.

160

- Get it.

161
00:12:08,799 --> 00:12:10,458
Just a bit off the mark.

I am not good at this.

No. It's a waste of money.

00:12:17,798 --> 00:12:19,620
I will help you.

167
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:30,119
Right.

168
00:12:36,860 --> 00:12:39,420
Great. We got it.

169
00:12:42,819 --> 00:12:44,019
Do you need a hand?

170
00:12:44,019 --> 00:12:45,540
Sure.

171
00:12:48,900 --> 00:12:51,659
We got a lot. But I only want two of them.

172
00:12:51,659 --> 00:12:54,059
Do you want to try something else?

173
00:12:54,740 --> 00:12:56,720
I'm tired. Should we get a drink together?

174
00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:59,219
Okay. Wait a second.

175
00:13:06,819 --> 00:13:09,098
Hi, friend. Do you want a doll?

176
00:13:09,098 --> 00:13:10,939
Which one do you like?

177
00:13:10,939 --> 00:13:13,298
Sure. This one?

178
00:13:13,298 --> 00:13:15,780
- Here you are.
- Haohao.

179
00:13:16,640 --> 00:13:18,440
This is for you.

180
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:21,019
And two more dolls.

181
00:13:21,019 --> 00:13:22,838
The nice lady over there sent these to you.

182
00:13:22,838 --> 00:13:25,440
Thank you, Sister.

183
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:36,440
<i>[Rest Garden House]</i>

184
00:13:40,420 --> 00:13:42,180
Your parents will come and have dinner.

185
00:13:42,180 --> 00:13:44,759
I need to get my makeup done and tidy up.

186
00:13:44,759 --> 00:13:47,500
Do you feel nervous?

187
00:13:47,500 --> 00:13:51,279
A bit. It's the first time to meet them since we got together.

188
00:13:51,279 --> 00:13:54,278
Don't worry. They like you very much.

189
00:13:55,240 --> 00:13:58,858
I haven't exercised in so long, it feels like by body is broken.

190
00:13:58,858 --> 00:14:01,419
You can tidy up later. Let me give you a massage.

191
00:14:01,419 --> 00:14:03,019
Come on.

192
00:14:08,220 --> 00:14:11,358
Lie on your stomach. I will relax your muscles.

193
00:14:11,358 --> 00:14:13,219
Or you'll feel sore tomorrow.

194
00:14:13,219 --> 00:14:14,760
Got it.

195
00:14:25,520 --> 00:14:26,839
It hurts.

196
00:14:26,839 --> 00:14:28,579
I have yet to do it with all my energy.

197
00:14:28,579 --> 00:14:32,180
Stop laughing. It hurts a lot.

198
00:14:32,180 --> 00:14:34,980
Your muscles are too tense. You need a strong massage.

199
00:14:34,980 --> 00:14:36,800
Hold on a bit longer.

200
00:14:38,039 --> 00:14:39,619
It hurts!

201
00:14:41,980 --> 00:14:44,838
This kid. He won't reply to me.

202
00:14:44,838 --> 00:14:47,659
Maybe he's working out now.

203
00:14:47,659 --> 00:14:49,639
The door lock has your fingerprint.

204
00:14:49,639 --> 00:14:50,880
Just go inside directly.

205
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:53,239
Okay. Let's go.

206
00:15:00,300 --> 00:15:01,660
Today is Wednesday.

207
00:15:01,660 --> 00:15:03,980
- It seems.
- Feels like it.

208
00:15:04,819 --> 00:15:05,939
<i>Hold on.</i>

209
00:15:05,939 --> 00:15:07,660
<i>It just takes a moment.</i>

210
00:15:07,660 --> 00:15:09,199
<i>Don't be so hard on me.</i>

211
00:15:09,199 --> 00:15:10,639
<i>I'm gentle enough.</i>

212
00:15:10,640 --> 00:15:13,059
<i>If I go deeper, it will work.</i>

213
00:15:14,139 --> 00:15:16,099
I feel like I'm getting paralysis.

214
00:15:16,099 --> 00:15:19,759
Trust me. You'll feel much better in the end.

215
00:15:19,759 --> 00:15:21,920
Is that your phone? Or is it mine ringing?

216
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:23,999
I'll check it out.

217
00:15:23,999 --> 00:15:25,940
Dad? Mom?

218
00:15:26,959 --> 00:15:29,220
When did you arrive?

219
00:15:29,220 --> 00:15:31,359
We just arrived.

220
00:15:32,019 --> 00:15:34,580
So where are you going now?

221
00:15:34,580 --> 00:15:35,659
Do your business.

222
00:15:35,659 --> 00:15:37,639
We'll take a walk around.

223
00:15:37,639 --> 00:15:39,160
Mrs. Lu. Mr. Lu.

224
00:15:39,160 --> 00:15:40,578
We're not busy.

225
00:15:40,578 --> 00:15:44,298
We went to play badminton, so I'm relaxing her sore muscles.

226
00:15:45,459 --> 00:15:47,939
Relax her muscles?

227
00:15:47,939 --> 00:15:49,320
I was scared.

228
00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:51,899
You were thinking too much.

229
00:15:51,899 --> 00:15:53,760
What were you thinking?

230
00:15:54,680 --> 00:15:56,659
Nothing. It's nothing.

231
00:15:56,659 --> 00:15:59,139
Prepare the tea for us?

232
00:15:59,139 --> 00:16:01,618
No problem. Take a seat.

233
00:16:01,618 --> 00:16:03,980
Put your bag there.

234
00:16:07,340 --> 00:16:11,458
Assistant Lin, did they make the salary adjustment plan for medical assistants?

235
00:16:11,458 --> 00:16:13,559
If you have it, send it to me now.

236
00:16:16,980 --> 00:16:19,000
Where are your parents?

237
00:16:19,699 --> 00:16:21,000
My mom said she wanted to cook.

238
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:24,058
I told them we'd prepare it. So they went to watch a movie.

239
00:16:24,900 --> 00:16:27,279
Then we can start cooking now.

240
00:16:27,279 --> 00:16:28,860
Sure.

241
00:16:28,860 --> 00:16:30,679
Let's go.

242
00:16:36,059 --> 00:16:38,240
Who taught you how to cook?

243
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:40,879
From my parents. And Aunt Peng.

244
00:16:40,879 --> 00:16:42,619
You don't often cook at home?

245
00:16:42,619 --> 00:16:47,200
No. But my mom and dad think cooking is a necessary skill to make a living.

246
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:49,499
So they taught me since I was a kid.

247
00:16:49,499 --> 00:16:52,740
Your parents taught you well.

248
00:16:52,740 --> 00:16:55,838
Why do you think so? Tell me about it.

249
00:16:55,838 --> 00:16:58,359
You really like to take a mile.

250
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:04,619
I like your personality. You're so kind that you can tolerate a lot of things.

251
00:17:04,619 --> 00:17:06,319
You have a high EQ.

252
00:17:06,319 --> 00:17:08,960
And you have humor. You're cute.

253
00:17:08,960 --> 00:17:11,339
You're nice in many aspects.

254
00:17:11,339 --> 00:17:12,939
You have a strong heart.

255
00:17:12,939 --> 00:17:14,859
And you're confident.

256
00:17:14,859 --> 00:17:18,660
- In all...
- In all, I am the type you like.

257
00:17:19,480 --> 00:17:23,760
In all, I like you very much.

258
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:25,859
Aren't you the eloquent one?

259
00:17:25,859 --> 00:17:27,900
I just said what I felt.

260
00:17:27,900 --> 00:17:31,899
Well. It's your feeling. Can you tell me about my shortcomings?

261
00:17:31,899 --> 00:17:33,299
There are none.

262
00:17:33,299 --> 00:17:35,340
None?

263
00:17:35,340 --> 00:17:37,559
Beauty is in the eye of the beholder.

264
00:17:37,559 --> 00:17:40,460
If being beautiful is a bad thing,

265
00:17:41,259 --> 00:17:43,700
it's because it's too beautiful.

266
00:17:46,419 --> 00:17:49,740
What made you so sweet today?

267
00:17:54,540 --> 00:17:56,359
You like honey?

268
00:17:57,180 --> 00:17:59,239
It tastes sweet.

269
00:17:59,239 --> 00:18:01,939
Isn't it just to make my boyfriend happy?

270
00:18:01,939 --> 00:18:03,860
I can do it.

271
00:18:14,420 --> 00:18:15,939
I am so happy today.

272
00:18:15,939 --> 00:18:17,699
I can be wild with the one who understands me.

273
00:18:17,699 --> 00:18:19,338
I don't have to care how others see me.

274
00:18:19,338 --> 00:18:22,259
We have a tacit understanding, and you know my tricks.

275
00:18:22,259 --> 00:18:23,459
I feel the same way.

276
00:18:23,459 --> 00:18:27,560
Since you know my secret, I felt much more relaxed.

277
00:18:27,560 --> 00:18:31,399
Well. When did you start reading this kind of novels?

278
00:18:32,060 --> 00:18:35,339
College graduating season. I was hunting for a job.

279
00:18:35,339 --> 00:18:37,539
I was thinking I might meet the president in the future,

280
00:18:37,539 --> 00:18:41,520
so I searched the internet with an understanding attitude.

281
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:44,419
- In the end...
- You opened the door to a new world.

282
00:18:44,419 --> 00:18:46,240
Yes.

283
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:48,378
But at the beginning, I just took it as a joke.

284
00:18:48,378 --> 00:18:50,939
I was complaining while reading it.

285
00:18:50,939 --> 00:18:55,340
But when I read into the story, I did have fun with it.

286
00:18:55,340 --> 00:18:58,179
So in recent years, I have had some favorite writers.

287
00:18:58,179 --> 00:19:01,779
I like to live a little less exaggerated style.

288
00:19:01,779 --> 00:19:03,738
Isn't that my style?

289
00:19:03,738 --> 00:19:05,780
Yes, so that is why I like it.

290
00:19:05,800 --> 00:19:11,100
You write about adult love in the logical lighthearted way that ordinary people live.

291
00:19:11,180 --> 00:19:13,218
Your characters get to know each other,

292
00:19:13,300 --> 00:19:17,200
appreciate each other, then fall in love, and live together.

293
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:19,839
This kind of romance is really beautiful.

294
00:19:20,619 --> 00:19:23,698
It's my first time hearing a good review from my reader in person.

295
00:19:23,698 --> 00:19:26,560
I am way too happy.

296
00:19:26,560 --> 00:19:30,160
And you? Why did you choose to write this kind of story?

297
00:19:31,859 --> 00:19:35,380
- Because of love.
- Do you have a boyfriend?

298
00:19:35,380 --> 00:19:37,400
Of course not.

299
00:19:40,580 --> 00:19:43,700
So... is it because of your ex?

300
00:19:43,700 --> 00:19:45,760
No, it's not the reason.

301
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:47,319
It's about my parents.

302
00:19:47,319 --> 00:19:49,518
They are together because of love.

303
00:19:49,518 --> 00:19:51,300
But they couldn't stop quarreling, then.

304
00:19:51,300 --> 00:19:53,679
They got divorced when I just entered high school.

305
00:19:53,679 --> 00:19:57,258
So I began to read romantic fiction to run away from reality.

306
00:19:57,258 --> 00:20:01,598
But I didn't expect that I would feel healed because of those stories.

307
00:20:01,598 --> 00:20:05,099
The characters in the novels were truly in love,

308
00:20:05,099 --> 00:20:09,659
so they could overcome various difficulties and live happily ever after.

309
00:20:09,659 --> 00:20:13,079
So it happened someday that I made up my mind to write romance by myself.

310
00:20:13,079 --> 00:20:16,320
So I can deliver the love message to the world.

311
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:20,700
As your reader, I indeed felt your heart was in it.

312
00:20:21,260 --> 00:20:23,498
To be honest, I know how others look down upon

313
00:20:23,498 --> 00:20:28,019
those who love romantic stories or romantic dramas.

314
00:20:28,019 --> 00:20:32,179
They are thought of as superficial, like living in dreams or unrealistic.

315
00:20:32,179 --> 00:20:35,119
They need better taste in literature.

316
00:20:36,139 --> 00:20:40,019
But in my eyes, everyone has different psychological needs.

317
00:20:40,019 --> 00:20:43,540
Most of them, have a little girl in their hearts.

318
00:20:43,540 --> 00:20:45,660
They believe in love sincerely.

319
00:20:45,660 --> 00:20:48,639
They're kind and warm-hearted.

320
00:20:50,540 --> 00:20:53,060
It sounds like a compliment to me.

321
00:20:53,060 --> 00:20:55,979
Yes. They're like you.

322
00:21:02,239 --> 00:21:05,679
Well, cheers. Thanks for dinner.

323
00:21:05,679 --> 00:21:08,120
You made many dishes.

324
00:21:09,219 --> 00:21:11,920
It was easy. Some simple dishes.

325
00:21:11,920 --> 00:21:13,639
- Try it.
- Sure.

326
00:21:13,639 --> 00:21:15,879
You know, Shilan made all these dishes.

327
00:21:15,880 --> 00:21:17,860
I was just an assistant.

328
00:21:17,860 --> 00:21:19,560
Why didn't you make them?

329
00:21:19,560 --> 00:21:22,059
She is a good cook. I don't want to embarrass myself.

330
00:21:22,059 --> 00:21:25,138
Don't say that. What if it doesn't taste good?

331
00:21:25,138 --> 00:21:26,819
Don'tworry.

332
00:21:26,819 --> 00:21:29,238
Even if it tastes bad, my parents will say it's delicious.

333
00:21:29,238 --> 00:21:30,540
You are talking nonsense again.

334
00:21:30,540 --> 00:21:34,260
In this way, it seems insincere for us to praise delicious food.

335
00:21:38,060 --> 00:21:42,038
I can't taste any raw chicken wing smell. How did you remove it?

336
00:21:42,038 --> 00:21:43,700
Clean it a few more times.

337
00:21:43,700 --> 00:21:47,420
Get it salted with cooking wine, ginger, and Sichuan pepper.

338
00:21:47,420 --> 00:21:49,119
It's a good idea to use pepper.

339
00:21:49,119 --> 00:21:50,960
This one is delicious, too.

340
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:52,998
Is it called stir-fried fish and shrimp?

341
00:21:52,998 --> 00:21:56,979
Yes. Her mother sent us the fish and shrimp.

342
00:21:56,979 --> 00:21:58,479
Is it a local cuisine?

343
00:21:58,479 --> 00:22:01,559
No. I just learned it on the internet.

344
00:22:01,559 --> 00:22:04,140
It is also called... "Moonlight over the Lotus Pond."

345
00:22:04,140 --> 00:22:06,639
It's poetic.

346
00:22:06,639 --> 00:22:08,560
I want to try it.

347
00:22:12,370 --> 00:22:14,070
It tastes as the name sounds.

348
00:22:14,070 --> 00:22:17,670
There is a taste of the countryside. Delicious.

349
00:22:17,678 --> 00:22:19,719
I just followed the recipe.

350
00:22:19,719 --> 00:22:23,358
Though following a recipe, it tastes differently if different people make it,

351
00:22:23,358 --> 00:22:25,879
which means you have a gift.

352
00:22:25,879 --> 00:22:28,619
She is habitually courteous and humble.

353
00:22:28,619 --> 00:22:30,299
How can I be?

354
00:22:30,299 --> 00:22:32,580
You have many talents.

355
00:22:32,580 --> 00:22:34,959
You're good at driving, as well as badminton.

356
00:22:34,959 --> 00:22:38,360
She said she couldn't play it but she's professional.

357
00:22:38,360 --> 00:22:40,160
Really? Who taught you that?

358
00:22:40,160 --> 00:22:43,900
No one taught me. I used to play with my dad when I was little.

359
00:22:43,900 --> 00:22:46,798
Just found a vacant place nearby, so we'd play it for a long time.

360
00:22:46,798 --> 00:22:50,680
It's the easiest form of entertainment.

361
00:22:50,680 --> 00:22:53,199
How are your parents now?

362
00:22:57,900 --> 00:23:00,420
I thought I'd told you.

363
00:23:01,820 --> 00:23:03,180
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

364
00:23:03,180 --> 00:23:04,640
It's all right.

365
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:06,750
Here. Try it.

366
00:23:06,750 --> 00:23:08,390
Thank you.

367
00:23:12,219 --> 00:23:15,959
I think Lu Zhaoxi has told you

368
00:23:15,959 --> 00:23:20,280
my father killed himself when I was a little girl.

369
00:23:22,700 --> 00:23:24,640
Yes, he told us.

370
00:23:25,300 --> 00:23:29,180
I wasn't willing to talk about my father.

371
00:23:29,180 --> 00:23:32,260
On the one hand, I felt the words stuck in my throat.

372
00:23:32,260 --> 00:23:36,719
On the other hand, I hated him to some extent.

373
00:23:36,719 --> 00:23:39,380
But since being with Lu Zhaoxi,

374
00:23:39,380 --> 00:23:43,619
step by step, I gradually let it go and figured it out.

375
00:23:43,619 --> 00:23:48,039
Because I loved him, so I hated him.

376
00:23:48,039 --> 00:23:50,579
I didn't want him to leave me.

377
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:54,639
So I'm good now. I've accepted the reality.

378
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:57,920
You don't have to avoid talking about it.

379
00:23:57,920 --> 00:24:00,879
- It's really good for you to think this way.
- Yes.

380
00:24:00,879 --> 00:24:03,700
Why didn't you tell me you've overcame it?

381
00:24:03,700 --> 00:24:05,700
Did you ever ask me?

382
00:24:07,839 --> 00:24:10,918
Thanks to you. Eat more.

383
00:24:13,939 --> 00:24:18,619
Well, let's propose a toast to Dr. Ye. Congratulations. Welcome back to Pediatrics.

384
00:24:18,619 --> 00:24:19,639
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

385
00:24:19,639 --> 00:24:21,900
- Congrats.
- Congratulations.

386
00:24:21,900 --> 00:24:23,640
You can do it.

387
00:24:25,180 --> 00:24:26,880
Frankly speaking,

388
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:31,460
you fell for her when you invited her to be your assistant?

389
00:24:31,460 --> 00:24:33,499
No, absolutely not.

390
00:24:33,499 --> 00:24:35,079
Didn't you?

391
00:24:37,839 --> 00:24:42,500
The true leader is here. I can't tell the truth, or I'll be lectured.

392
00:24:42,500 --> 00:24:46,999
I came here today only for dinner. So I didn't hear anything else.

393
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:49,579
Just eat.

394
00:24:55,480 --> 00:24:59,639
What did you say to my mom? You two looked so happy.

395
00:25:00,379 --> 00:25:03,219
She told me a secret about you.

396
00:25:04,739 --> 00:25:06,900
What does it mean?

397
00:25:08,300 --> 00:25:10,719
It's just a gesture.

398
00:25:10,719 --> 00:25:15,598
She said, every time your mind wanders, you would habitually do this.

399
00:25:15,598 --> 00:25:18,260
Why does my mother keep betraying me?

400
00:25:18,780 --> 00:25:21,019
So what is it actually?

401
00:25:21,019 --> 00:25:24,659
It has no special meaning. I used to watch Ikkyū-san.

402
00:25:24,659 --> 00:25:28,859
When the monk is thinking, he sits cross-legged with his finger drawing circles above his head.

403
00:25:28,859 --> 00:25:32,060
It's interesting to me, but too exaggerated.

404
00:25:32,060 --> 00:25:34,260
So I made up a gesture for myself.

405
00:25:34,260 --> 00:25:37,639
Then it became a subconscious habit.

406
00:25:37,639 --> 00:25:40,019
It's what a middle school student would do.

407
00:25:40,019 --> 00:25:42,099
- What about you?
- I don't.

408
00:25:42,099 --> 00:25:43,659
I'm precocious.

409
00:25:43,659 --> 00:25:47,018
Then if you definitely have something like that in the future, I will cooperate with you.

410
00:25:51,119 --> 00:25:55,720
Do you want to tell others that we're together?

411
00:25:55,720 --> 00:25:58,240
What made you think that?

412
00:25:58,240 --> 00:26:01,519
I'm afraid that you may feel wronged.

413
00:26:01,519 --> 00:26:03,740
No, I don't.

414
00:26:05,460 --> 00:26:08,099
But ever since we did the free clinic,

415
00:26:08,099 --> 00:26:11,639
some people are spreading our gossip.

416
00:26:11,639 --> 00:26:13,280
Really?

417
00:26:13,859 --> 00:26:18,518
Assistant Lin told me. I was afraid you'd feel stifled so I didn't tell you.

418
00:26:20,159 --> 00:26:25,560
That's why people came to say hi to me recently at the hospital.

419
00:26:25,560 --> 00:26:29,759
I didn't even know who they were, but it looked like they know me well.

420
00:26:29,759 --> 00:26:33,820
I thought they treated me in this way because I was your assistant.

421
00:26:33,820 --> 00:26:38,659
But then I felt weird because it's been a period since I was your assistant.

422
00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:42,739
Maybe in their eyes now, you're not an assistant,

423
00:26:42,739 --> 00:26:45,380
you're the girlfriend of the president.

424
00:26:46,839 --> 00:26:51,179
Actually, I don't want to be treated differently.

425
00:26:53,399 --> 00:26:56,440
Don't worry. As long as we don't admit it,

426
00:26:56,440 --> 00:26:58,830
the gossip will be over soon.

427
00:27:10,060 --> 00:27:12,598
- Good morning, President.
- Morning.

428
00:27:15,019 --> 00:27:16,279
Who is taking care of your kids?

429
00:27:16,280 --> 00:27:18,139
Her grandpa and grandma.

430
00:27:18,139 --> 00:27:19,739
Just tell me if you need a day off.

431
00:27:19,739 --> 00:27:22,040
Yes. Thank you.

432
00:27:23,360 --> 00:27:25,959
<i>[Consultation Room]</i>
Come here, I will listen to it.

433
00:27:25,959 --> 00:27:28,019
<i>[Consultation Room]</i>

434
00:27:28,019 --> 00:27:29,819
Inhale.

435
00:27:29,819 --> 00:27:31,699
Exhale.

436
00:27:32,359 --> 00:27:33,700
Inhale.

437
00:27:33,700 --> 00:27:35,300
Exhale.

438
00:27:35,300 --> 00:27:38,739
Good. Turn around, please.

439
00:27:42,259 --> 00:27:44,159
Inhale.

440
00:27:44,159 --> 00:27:45,720
Exhale.

441
00:27:46,379 --> 00:27:47,640
It's done.

442
00:27:50,060 --> 00:27:53,078
I'll write you an order to get a blood test.

443
00:27:53,078 --> 00:27:55,461
It may be mycoplasma pneumonia.

444
00:27:55,461 --> 00:27:57,660
Doctor, I searched for it on the internet.

445
00:27:57,660 --> 00:28:00,460
He can heal by himself from this kind of pneumonia.

446
00:28:00,460 --> 00:28:02,579
Does he have to take medicine?

447
00:28:02,579 --> 00:28:04,660
You don't want him to take it?

448
00:28:04,660 --> 00:28:08,699
I don't. I feel it's bad for him to take too much.

449
00:28:08,699 --> 00:28:11,099
I can understand why you think so,

450
00:28:11,099 --> 00:28:15,460
but the medicine he takes will support his body to prevent severe illness.

451
00:28:15,460 --> 00:28:18,750
If it was just a common nasopharyngitis, there would be no need for medicine.

452
00:28:18,750 --> 00:28:21,180
But his condition is a bit serious now,

453
00:28:21,180 --> 00:28:24,060
so my conclusion is to use an antibiotic.

454
00:28:24,060 --> 00:28:28,140
Take a blood test first. When you get the result, I'll explain it in detail.

455
00:28:28,140 --> 00:28:31,198
- Got it. Thank you so much.
- No problem.

456
00:28:34,399 --> 00:28:36,180
Dr. Zeng.

457
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:42,219
Dr. Zeng, are the president and Dr. Ye together now?

458
00:28:42,219 --> 00:28:45,720
- I don't know.
- But I heard that you said it.

459
00:29:01,739 --> 00:29:04,519
You're trying to kill me.

460
00:29:04,519 --> 00:29:06,100
What's wrong?

461
00:29:06,100 --> 00:29:10,099
Now everybody is saying I told everyone they're in a relationship now.

462
00:29:10,099 --> 00:29:12,499
I didn't say it was you.

463
00:29:12,499 --> 00:29:15,619
You said I was the one who felt something between them.

464
00:29:15,619 --> 00:29:19,819
So now they're spreading I am the one who said it.

465
00:29:20,580 --> 00:29:22,239
I am sorry.

466
00:29:29,700 --> 00:29:30,978
- Hi.
- Welcome.

467
00:29:30,978 --> 00:29:33,999
- It's Ms. Wu's reservation. Eight seats.
- Got it.

468
00:29:33,999 --> 00:29:37,219
Okay, please follow me. This way.

469
00:29:55,900 --> 00:29:58,279
- Come on. Cheers.
<i>- Come on.</i>

470
00:29:58,279 --> 00:30:01,260
<i>- Cheers.
- Cheers</i>

471
00:30:01,260 --> 00:30:03,680
Thanks to Dr. Ye for inviting us to eat here.

472
00:30:03,680 --> 00:30:06,099
It's the president who is buying us the dinner.

473
00:30:06,099 --> 00:30:08,099
But it is because of you.

474
00:30:08,099 --> 00:30:10,060
When Dr. Ye worked as an assistant,

475
00:30:10,060 --> 00:30:12,799
she introduced how we work to him,

476
00:30:12,800 --> 00:30:15,280
so he should buy us dinner because he's learned a lot.

477
00:30:15,280 --> 00:30:16,920
Why didn't the president join us?

478
00:30:16,920 --> 00:30:19,438
He's afraid we'd feel uncomfortable if he were here.

479
00:30:19,439 --> 00:30:20,739
It doesn't matter, actually.

480
00:30:20,739 --> 00:30:23,580
We're almost the same age. We may have a lot to talk about.

481
00:30:23,580 --> 00:30:24,780
I am not so sure about that.

482
00:30:24,780 --> 00:30:29,180
The life he's been living since he was born, is far too different from ours.

483
00:30:30,379 --> 00:30:33,979
I heard you're friends, Dr. Ye.

484
00:30:35,540 --> 00:30:39,619
Yes, we talked a lot. He's nice and friendly.

485
00:30:39,619 --> 00:30:40,919
I can prove it.

486
00:30:40,920 --> 00:30:44,759
The last time he drove us to Taoyuan Village, he talked with us all the way.

487
00:30:44,759 --> 00:30:48,399
To be honest, we have a burden to face him because he is the president.

488
00:30:48,399 --> 00:30:52,319
So we have to be cautious when we speak to him. Right?

489
00:30:52,319 --> 00:30:55,459
Dr. Ye, do you feel the same?

490
00:30:55,459 --> 00:30:58,500
I used to feel pressured, but now I don't feel the same.

491
00:30:58,500 --> 00:31:01,760
Does he... have a girlfriend?

492
00:31:01,760 --> 00:31:03,019
Didn't you hear?

493
00:31:03,019 --> 00:31:04,820
What should I hear?

494
00:31:08,540 --> 00:31:10,519
Is it something forbidden to say?

495
00:31:10,520 --> 00:31:13,980
It's just like a topic for afternoon tea.

496
00:31:15,820 --> 00:31:18,260
Yes, I've heard it.

497
00:31:18,260 --> 00:31:21,580
They're saying I'm dating the president.

498
00:31:21,580 --> 00:31:23,599
Really interesting.

499
00:31:25,560 --> 00:31:28,960
It shouldn't be a serious problem. It would be great if it were true.

500
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:33,260
But the story is getting out of control.

501
00:31:33,260 --> 00:31:35,359
What are they saying?

502
00:31:35,359 --> 00:31:37,318
It's nothing more than saying that he's a spoiled rich son,

503
00:31:37,319 --> 00:31:41,218
a playboy, he's just playing with you, so he won't go public with it.

504
00:31:41,218 --> 00:31:45,059
I never heard that. That's too outrageous.

505
00:31:45,059 --> 00:31:47,719
Isn't the president being wronged?

506
00:31:47,719 --> 00:31:51,400
I think these words should not reach the president's ears.

507
00:31:51,400 --> 00:31:56,138
But if you can tell him, it's the best way to dispel the rumor.

508
00:32:13,780 --> 00:32:17,560
Dr. Ye, are you all right?

509
00:32:17,560 --> 00:32:19,399
I'm fine.

510
00:32:20,099 --> 00:32:22,540
I don't know what you have heard.

511
00:32:22,540 --> 00:32:25,300
But I didn't spread it.

512
00:32:25,300 --> 00:32:28,400
I know. I believe you.

513
00:32:30,700 --> 00:32:32,739
Do you know where the wine is?

514
00:32:32,739 --> 00:32:34,820
You want to have a drink?

515
00:32:36,040 --> 00:32:38,520
Over there. Let's go to get it together.

516
00:32:38,520 --> 00:32:40,139
Okay.

517

<i>Dr. Ye, are you having fun?</i>

518
00:33:13,300 --> 00:33:15,780
<i>Are you back home now?</i>

519
00:33:15,780 --> 00:33:18,878
<i>Not yet. I have to work for a while.</i>

520
00:33:33,560 --> 00:33:35,160
<i>How is it?</i>

521
00:33:35,160 --> 00:33:37,459
<i>It's delicious. Try it.</i>

522
00:33:49,719 --> 00:33:52,360

You told me that they'd left.

532
00:34:41,619 --> 00:34:43,399
I lied to you.

541
00:35:31,339 --> 00:35:33,180
Did you drink?

542
00:35:34,600 --> 00:35:36,380
A little bit.

543
00:35:37,859 --> 00:35:40,360
Why don't you explain it to me?

544
00:35:41,900 --> 00:35:43,460
Are you happy?

545
00:35:43,460 --> 00:35:45,259
Sure I am.

546
00:35:46,360 --> 00:35:51,479
In fact, you want everyone to know about our relationship. Am I right?

547
00:35:52,080 --> 00:35:53,960
Were you stimulated by something?

548
00:35:53,960 --> 00:35:56,140
Am I right?

549
00:35:56,140 --> 00:35:57,679
Right.

550
00:35:57,679 --> 00:36:00,679
Why didn't you tell me clearly?

551
00:36:01,479 --> 00:36:04,000
So what on earth happened?

552
00:36:04,819 --> 00:36:09,059
The other colleagues are saying you are cheating my feelings,

553
00:36:09,059 --> 00:36:10,960
so you don't want to disclose it.

554
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:12,939
So I got angry.

555
00:36:12,939 --> 00:36:16,739
It was my idea, and you're the one who is being sacrificed.

556
00:36:19,020 --> 00:36:23,319
So you asked me to pick you up on purpose to clear my name.

557
00:36:23,319 --> 00:36:25,279
Yes.

558
00:36:25,279 --> 00:36:27,099
You should've introduced me to them.

559
00:36:27,099 --> 00:36:30,379
I did so. I told them my boyfriend would pick me up

560
00:36:30,379 --> 00:36:33,300
before leaving the restaurant.

561
00:36:34,539 --> 00:36:37,760
Now I have officially become your boyfriend.

562
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:42,240
But it should be a secret, do you regret being too impulsive?

563
00:36:42,240 --> 00:36:43,979
No, I don't.

564
00:36:44,579 --> 00:36:48,279
I was too scared to face it. I was a coward.

565
00:36:48,279 --> 00:36:50,500
So I am sorry.

566
00:36:50,500 --> 00:36:52,459
Don't feel sorry for me.

567
00:36:52,459 --> 00:36:55,139
It's enough for me that you're satisfied with your decision.

568
00:36:55,139 --> 00:36:57,140
I'm happy now.

569
00:36:57,140 --> 00:37:00,320
I finally feel relieved now.

570
00:37:01,020 --> 00:37:04,299
Let's move forward together step by step

571
00:37:04,299 --> 00:37:06,840
to face what will happen in the future.

572
00:37:07,579 --> 00:37:08,980
Sure.

573
00:37:09,980 --> 00:37:11,479
Music?

574
00:37:11,479 --> 00:37:13,100
Please.

President, I'll do it.

584
00:38:23,538 --> 00:38:25,219
Dr. Ye taught me how to water it.

585
00:38:25,219 --> 00:38:28,379
It's okay. I've done it. I needed to stretch my legs.

586
00:38:28,379 --> 00:38:29,640
Got it.

587
00:38:29,640 --> 00:38:34,660
Wait a second. Do you know the relationship between Dr. Ye and me?

588
00:38:34,660 --> 00:38:37,139
I've heard something these days.

589
00:38:37,139 --> 00:38:39,618
Don't say anything about us to others.

590
00:38:39,618 --> 00:38:41,999
Don't specially treat her. She doesn't like it.

591
00:38:41,999 --> 00:38:44,180
Got it. I see.

592
00:38:44,700 --> 00:38:46,720
- Clean it.
- Sure.

593
00:38:51,940 --> 00:38:53,879
President Gao.

594
00:38:53,879 --> 00:38:55,719
Where's Dr. Ye?

595
00:38:55,719 --> 00:38:57,819
She's in a meeting.

596
00:39:00,619 --> 00:39:02,459
Dr. Ye, I have something to tell you.

597
00:39:02,459 --> 00:39:04,319
President, what is it?

598
00:39:04,319 --> 00:39:10,099
Here is the thing. Tomorrow, we'll hold a meeting to advocate medical support.

599
00:39:10,099 --> 00:39:12,019
So would you mind giving us a speech

600
00:39:12,019 --> 00:39:14,538
about your experiences and thoughts on it?

601
00:39:14,538 --> 00:39:18,039
I... I can't do it. I'm not good at it.

602
00:39:18,039 --> 00:39:21,419
It's not difficult. Just say what you think.

603
00:39:21,419 --> 00:39:23,860
It's a good opportunity to practice.

604
00:39:23,860 --> 00:39:26,818
You know, many other doctors participated in the support.

605
00:39:26,818 --> 00:39:28,980
Others would do a better job.

606
00:39:28,980 --> 00:39:35,578
No. You are one of the three speakers I chose.

607
00:39:35,578 --> 00:39:39,459
And I think you're President Lu's girlfriend,

608
00:39:39,459 --> 00:39:45,399
so your speech will draw more attention. Right?

609
00:39:48,539 --> 00:39:50,439
What about...

610
00:39:50,439 --> 00:39:52,540
Should I ask for his permission?

611
00:39:52,540 --> 00:39:54,459
No.

612
00:39:54,459 --> 00:39:57,499
Well... Count me in.

613
00:39:57,499 --> 00:40:00,718
That's it. Get ready for it.

614
00:40:00,718 --> 00:40:04,039
President Gao, please call me if you need anything, I'll meet you in your office.

615
00:40:04,039 --> 00:40:05,579
Okay, I know.

616
00:40:05,579 --> 00:40:07,679
See you, President Gao.

617
00:40:21,439 --> 00:40:23,139
I guess you're together.

618
00:40:23,139 --> 00:40:26,078
But you didn't say anything. So I had to pretend.

619
00:40:26,078 --> 00:40:28,959
But you're so cool that you admitted it in that way.

620
00:40:28,959 --> 00:40:32,599
I don't want others keep guessing over and over again.

621
00:40:32,599 --> 00:40:35,418
I understand it. So we just helped to spread it.

622
00:40:35,418 --> 00:40:38,259
But we didn't expect even President Gao to hear it.

623
00:40:40,420 --> 00:40:43,999
So you know why I don't want to admit it?

624
00:40:43,999 --> 00:40:45,138
Of course.

625
00:40:45,138 --> 00:40:48,638
Your position and background are the opposite of the president's.

626
00:40:48,638 --> 00:40:51,219
So others will talk a lot about it.

627
00:40:51,219 --> 00:40:55,999
And when they work with you, they can't ignore that you're his girlfriend.

628
00:40:55,999 --> 00:41:00,198
Your behaviors and your words will be relevant to the president.

629
00:41:00,198 --> 00:41:02,540
Or they will think everything you do is his idea.

630
00:41:02,540 --> 00:41:06,099
Yes. I am stressed out.

631
00:41:06,099 --> 00:41:08,499
But it's up to the personality.

632
00:41:08,499 --> 00:41:10,739
Some people might enjoy it even if it's related.

633
00:41:10,739 --> 00:41:15,019
Look. The vice president has to come in person if he needs me. How face-saving it is.

634
00:41:15,019 --> 00:41:19,838
If it spreads like this, it will become me as a fox pretending to be a tiger. I'm showing off.

635
00:41:19,838 --> 00:41:21,980
And people would believe it.

636
00:41:21,980 --> 00:41:23,819
I have to be more careful.

637
00:41:23,819 --> 00:41:26,960
I can't decide what others say. I have no choice.
