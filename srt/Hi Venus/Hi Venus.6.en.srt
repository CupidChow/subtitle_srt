<i>[Hi Venus]</i>

15
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:29,840
<i>[Episode 06]</i>

16
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:50,985
President.

17
00:02:52,985 --> 00:02:55,485
Is there anything I can do for you?

18
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:57,630
No.

19
00:03:00,170 --> 00:03:01,957
Relax.

20
00:03:03,500 --> 00:03:05,140
I'm not supervising you.

21
00:03:05,140 --> 00:03:07,390
I'm sure you won't be lazy.

22
00:03:09,110 --> 00:03:11,620
<i>You don't have to oversee me. I won't be lazy.</i>

23
00:03:11,620 --> 00:03:13,650
<i>I don't care about you.</i>

24
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:16,260
I...

25
00:03:16,260 --> 00:03:18,220
Is that so?

26
00:03:20,528 --> 00:03:22,340
Assistant Lin recommended this fruity tea.

27
00:03:22,340 --> 00:03:24,714
I'm not used to it. Try it.

28
00:03:24,714 --> 00:03:26,528
Thank you, President.

29
00:03:59,470 --> 00:04:01,959
Guys, Dr. Li lost a bet.

30
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:03,719
He bought us coffee.

31
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:07,239
I told you Dr. Ye would say yes to be the president's assistant.

32
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:08,513
He didn't believe me.

33
00:04:08,514 --> 00:04:10,741
The president and Dr. Ye's interactions

34
00:04:10,742 --> 00:04:13,941
at the event were very unusual.

35
00:04:13,942 --> 00:04:16,540
Am I the only one that thinks so?

36
00:04:16,540 --> 00:04:18,380
Dr. Ye, what did you drop?

37
00:04:18,380 --> 00:04:20,428
Do you need some help?

38
00:04:24,457 --> 00:04:26,514
Thank you.

39
00:04:26,514 --> 00:04:28,310
No.

40
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:40,057
Dr. Zeng, you bet on me.

41
00:04:40,057 --> 00:04:44,350
How could you miss my coffee?

42
00:04:44,350 --> 00:04:45,920
Thanks.

43
00:04:49,780 --> 00:04:55,250
By the way, I'll be back in Pediatrics in a few days.

44
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:05,728
Having the president on her side is different.

45
00:05:05,728 --> 00:05:09,230
Okay, all right. Back to work.

46
00:05:16,253 --> 00:05:19,186
<i>[Lu Zhaoxi, President of Anxing Hospital]</i>

47
00:05:28,350 --> 00:05:29,780
Come in.

48
00:05:32,790 --> 00:05:38,350
Here's the Italy espresso you wanted, no sugar with milk.

49
00:05:38,350 --> 00:05:39,900
Please.

50
00:05:46,670 --> 00:05:49,171
Is there a problem?

51
00:05:49,171 --> 00:05:51,585
Is it the only tableware in the break room?

52
00:05:51,585 --> 00:05:52,614
No.

53
00:05:52,614 --> 00:05:54,840
Then, why did you use it?

54
00:05:54,840 --> 00:05:56,328
I chose it at random.

55
00:05:56,328 --> 00:05:58,719
Is it fresh milk or oat milk in the coffee?

56
00:05:58,720 --> 00:05:59,763
Fresh milk.

57
00:05:59,764 --> 00:06:02,042
That's the problem.

58
00:06:02,042 --> 00:06:04,759
- Did I get something wrong?
- You didn't ask me.

59
00:06:06,123 --> 00:06:09,253
All of the black tableware in the break room is for me only.

60
00:06:09,253 --> 00:06:11,542
Don't mix them with those for guests.

61
00:06:11,542 --> 00:06:14,130
Okay, I see.

62
00:06:15,450 --> 00:06:19,300
Assistants don't seem to have any professional skills.

63
00:06:19,300 --> 00:06:22,000
But they should be very thoughtful.

64
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:26,742
Especially, since you'll meet important people related to the hospital besides me.

65
00:06:26,742 --> 00:06:30,628
Before you do anything, you're supposed to confirm what you don't know.

66
00:06:30,628 --> 00:06:32,913
Not everything is the default.

67
00:06:32,914 --> 00:06:36,227
Just like, you can't think everyone drinks fresh milk

68
00:06:36,228 --> 00:06:40,030
when they're lactose tolerant. Right?

69
00:06:40,030 --> 00:06:41,457
Yeah.

70
00:06:42,057 --> 00:06:44,600
I'll keep that in mind.

71
00:06:49,100 --> 00:06:53,380
Your first day as an assistant was so peaceful.

72
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:57,600
What? Should I show the president a back-flip twist

73
00:06:57,670 --> 00:06:59,040
and Thomas Flare?

74
00:07:00,070 --> 00:07:03,380
Don't try to get inspiration from me.

75
00:07:03,380 --> 00:07:05,250
I have to.

76
00:07:05,250 --> 00:07:06,949
I need to update my novel every day.

77
00:07:06,950 --> 00:07:09,060
I need to get more material.

78
00:07:09,060 --> 00:07:10,500
You don't read web novels.

79
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:13,571
You don't know readers nowadays are impatient.

80
00:07:13,571 --> 00:07:16,450
If I set the stage, they say there's a lot of padding.

81
00:07:16,450 --> 00:07:19,970
If I portray the characters, they say it's a load of shit.

82
00:07:19,970 --> 00:07:22,940
If two characters don't argue in a chapter,

83
00:07:22,940 --> 00:07:25,039
they scold me and give it up.

84
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:27,229
Then they download the pirated one

85
00:07:27,230 --> 00:07:30,199
and claim that my novel is bad.

86
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:31,541
It's not worth the money.

87
00:07:31,542 --> 00:07:33,660
So shameless?

88
00:07:33,660 --> 00:07:37,000
Sounds like you're worse than me.

89
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:40,856
So, you should help me if you can.

90
00:07:40,857 --> 00:07:42,919
If what happened to you is wonderful,

91
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:44,269
I'll write a novel about

92
00:07:44,270 --> 00:07:47,742
a CEO and his assistant after I finish this one.

93
00:07:47,742 --> 00:07:50,540
Well, you might be disappointed.

94
00:07:50,540 --> 00:07:53,730
He's not like other CEOs.

95
00:07:54,760 --> 00:07:57,879
Every time I thought he was making a hard time for me,

96
00:07:57,880 --> 00:08:01,642
I found he did have a point.

97
00:08:01,642 --> 00:08:04,799
Sometimes he understood and comforted his employees.

98
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:08,400
Actually, he's a nice leader.

99
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:12,100
So, you think he's not going to get back at you?

100
00:08:12,857 --> 00:08:16,128
Life is long. Who knows?

101
00:08:16,128 --> 00:08:19,119
Life is long. Maybe I'll get the chance.

102
00:08:19,119 --> 00:08:23,700
Sorry. I'll try to get rid of him soon

103
00:08:23,700 --> 00:08:25,600
and get back to Pediatrics.

104
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:29,479
He and I will go on with our lives.

105
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:30,789
Don't be so sure.

106
00:08:30,790 --> 00:08:33,340
Or it'll be a slap in your face.

107
00:08:37,030 --> 00:08:42,499
The guy who puts strawberry smoothies in his thermos you talked about last time, how's your observation of him?

108
00:08:42,499 --> 00:08:44,540
It's productive.

109
00:08:44,540 --> 00:08:48,150
With my discerning eyes I've trained over many years,

110
00:08:48,150 --> 00:08:52,650
I'm sure he's obviously a man with a story.

111
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,590
Thank you.

112
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:26,549
Come on, sit.

113
00:09:26,550 --> 00:09:27,900
Okay.

114
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:30,669
Their tea is nice. Taste it.

115
00:09:30,669 --> 00:09:33,871
I'm sorry. I was delayed.

116
00:09:33,871 --> 00:09:35,220
President Lu just took the post.

117
00:09:35,220 --> 00:09:37,370
You have to know everything in advance.

118
00:09:37,370 --> 00:09:39,549
Now is your busiest time.

119
00:09:39,550 --> 00:09:43,100
Yeah. Thanks so much for your help.

120
00:09:43,100 --> 00:09:46,450
- Assistant Lin, what do you do for fun?
- Reading.

121
00:09:46,450 --> 00:09:48,520
What kind?

122
00:09:48,520 --> 00:09:50,859
- General novels.
- Good.

123
00:09:50,859 --> 00:09:54,690
Reading is a nice way to deal with pressure.

124
00:09:54,690 --> 00:09:57,827
Some people don't know what assistants do.

125
00:09:57,828 --> 00:09:59,450
They think they just fetch and carry.

126
00:09:59,450 --> 00:10:04,940
No, actually. Assistants aid CEOs in making all decisions

127
00:10:04,940 --> 00:10:06,913
and providing them with information.

128
00:10:06,914 --> 00:10:12,071
Information is the most important resource in this society.

129
00:10:12,071 --> 00:10:13,541
You're the senior in this area.

130
00:10:13,542 --> 00:10:16,030
I should learn from you.

131
00:10:16,030 --> 00:10:18,589
President Lu chose you out of so many people.

132
00:10:18,590 --> 00:10:20,970
He must have targeted you for your skills.

133
00:10:20,971 --> 00:10:23,279
Well, it doesn't make a difference to me.

134
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:25,628
I just changed places to work.

135
00:10:25,628 --> 00:10:27,810
Assistant Lin, you're young and promising.

136
00:10:27,810 --> 00:10:32,050
You won't always work for someone.

137
00:10:33,220 --> 00:10:36,899
I have to work for a living. And I don't have a rich family.

138
00:10:36,899 --> 00:10:39,340
I'm used to doing steady work.

139
00:10:40,280 --> 00:10:43,414
Look... President Lu's family was not rich when he was young.

140
00:10:43,414 --> 00:10:45,930
Now he's successful in business.

141
00:10:45,930 --> 00:10:48,157
A good guy needs three fellows.

142
00:10:48,157 --> 00:10:50,513
Assistant Lin, just let me know if you need me

143
00:10:50,514 --> 00:10:53,010
when you start your business.

144
00:10:53,010 --> 00:10:57,910
I got nothing but some good resources I've accumulated over the years.

145
00:10:57,910 --> 00:11:00,909
Since you've said so, I'll toast with tea.

146
00:11:00,910 --> 00:11:02,110
Thank you.

147
00:11:02,110 --> 00:11:03,970
Okay, here.

148
00:11:08,971 --> 00:11:13,029
I introduced several assistants to President Lu the other day.

149
00:11:13,030 --> 00:11:15,257
He didn't like them.

150
00:11:15,257 --> 00:11:19,490
Why did he choose a doctor to be his assistant?

151
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:27,130
You don't have to say if it's a secret.

152
00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:32,300
Not at all, actually.

153
00:11:32,300 --> 00:11:36,656
The president wanted Dr. Ye to be his assistant from the beginning.

154
00:11:37,910 --> 00:11:42,780
Is Dr. Ye different?

155
00:11:42,780 --> 00:11:46,814
I'll tell you, but you can't leak it.

156
00:11:46,814 --> 00:11:48,557
I won't.

157
00:11:48,557 --> 00:11:52,328
Dr. Ye is a subordinate of Chief Pediatrician Huang.

158
00:11:52,328 --> 00:11:56,620
The president wanted to use Dr. Ye to punish Chief Huang.

159
00:12:01,370 --> 00:12:03,014
That's it?

160
00:12:04,971 --> 00:12:07,490
The president is brilliant.

161
00:12:07,490 --> 00:12:09,570
<i>[Outpatient]</i>

162
00:12:10,271 --> 00:12:12,314
The producer is called Qin Xiangyang.

163
00:12:12,314 --> 00:12:15,030
His last few productions were doing well.

164
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:19,250
You know them?

165
00:12:20,100 --> 00:12:22,600
Yeah, you're in the same field.

166
00:12:23,300 --> 00:12:25,470
You're welcome to visit me, of course.

167
00:12:25,470 --> 00:12:29,484
You know, my mom talked about inviting you over for dinner

168
00:12:29,485 --> 00:12:31,714
when you came back from Xinjiang.

169
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,520
All right, when you get back.

170
00:12:35,520 --> 00:12:37,442
See you.

171
00:12:40,614 --> 00:12:42,428
President, here's your coffee.

172
00:12:42,428 --> 00:12:44,860
- Put it on the table.
- Okay.

173
00:12:47,628 --> 00:12:50,880
It's just your third day as an assistant and you're good at it.

174
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:52,440
Yeah, I guess.

175
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:55,680
You can let me know if there's anything you don't like.

176
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:56,940
I will.

177
00:12:56,940 --> 00:12:59,340
How are you with the phone numbers?

178
00:12:59,340 --> 00:13:00,728
Halfway there.

179
00:13:00,728 --> 00:13:02,080
Want to test me?

180
00:13:02,080 --> 00:13:04,260
That's not necessary.

181
00:13:04,260 --> 00:13:07,020
Well, I'd like to ask you a question.

182
00:13:07,020 --> 00:13:08,340
Go ahead.

183
00:13:08,340 --> 00:13:12,629
If you're not at your desk, how can I reach you in an emergency when I'm out?

184
00:13:12,629 --> 00:13:15,528
Call me or WeChat me.

185
00:13:15,528 --> 00:13:17,670
I'll be right there.

186
00:13:18,900 --> 00:13:22,840
Well, Assistant Ye, I still haven't gotten your number.

187
00:13:22,840 --> 00:13:25,280
And I don't have your WeChat.

188
00:13:27,220 --> 00:13:30,356
Oh, yeah. I'm sorry. I forgot about it.

189
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:32,879
I memorized your number.

190
00:13:32,879 --> 00:13:35,470
I'll call you and you can save the number.

191
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:44,450
Yeah.

192
00:13:45,357 --> 00:13:48,400
Let me have your WeChat. I'll scan your QR code.

193
00:13:54,442 --> 00:13:58,556
Put "A" in front of my name. Then I'll be at the top.

194
00:14:12,485 --> 00:14:15,850
I thought "A" was for the most important one.

195
00:14:15,850 --> 00:14:20,150
I mean, you can find me easily this way.

196
00:14:26,071 --> 00:14:29,050
I have one more thing to tell you.

197
00:14:29,050 --> 00:14:30,100
Go on.

198
00:14:30,100 --> 00:14:32,610
You always sit at the computer table.

199
00:14:32,610 --> 00:14:34,500
Your back always seems uncomfortable.

200
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:37,400
A waist pillow would be better.

201
00:14:38,014 --> 00:14:41,571
And you seem to like green plants a lot.

202
00:14:41,571 --> 00:14:43,780
There are empty vases in the break room.

203
00:14:43,780 --> 00:14:48,285
I'll get you flowers regularly if you like.

204
00:14:48,285 --> 00:14:50,657
Great. Do that.

205
00:14:50,657 --> 00:14:52,230
Okay.

206
00:14:54,157 --> 00:14:56,728
I've transferred you 5,000 yuan for your needs.

207
00:14:56,728 --> 00:14:58,440
It's from my personal account.

208
00:14:58,440 --> 00:15:02,810
Keep the account, don't come asking for money.

209
00:15:03,450 --> 00:15:04,910
Okay.

210
00:15:20,257 --> 00:15:22,600
- Assistant Lin.
- Assistant Ye.

211
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:28,150
<i>Come in.</i>

212
00:15:36,550 --> 00:15:39,728
Are you satisfied with Assistant Ye's performance?

213
00:15:39,728 --> 00:15:41,420
Sure.

214
00:15:41,420 --> 00:15:43,057
She can remember what I said.

215
00:15:43,057 --> 00:15:45,341
And she can find problems initially.

216
00:15:45,341 --> 00:15:47,471
Easy and comfortable to talk with her.

217
00:15:47,471 --> 00:15:50,940
I don't want her to go back to Pediatrics.

218
00:15:50,940 --> 00:15:52,130
Are you serious?

219
00:15:52,130 --> 00:15:53,850
I'm kidding, of course.

220
00:15:53,850 --> 00:15:55,360
Good.

221
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:58,670
Don't forget why you wanted her to be your assistant.

222
00:15:59,693 --> 00:16:03,450
Assistant Lin, I think it's right to take your job seriously.

223
00:16:03,450 --> 00:16:06,280
But try to be easy on the conversation.

224
00:16:06,860 --> 00:16:08,570
Okay.

225
00:16:11,528 --> 00:16:14,930
President, do you like Ye Shilan?

226
00:16:14,930 --> 00:16:16,171
What are you saying?

227
00:16:16,171 --> 00:16:19,400
I remember you wanted to get even with her at first.

228
00:16:20,540 --> 00:16:23,113
It's a pretext for transferring her to be my assistant.

229
00:16:23,113 --> 00:16:24,456
To remind her that she owed me.

230
00:16:24,457 --> 00:16:28,639
So that it'd increase my bargaining chip to get her to go along with my plan.

231
00:16:28,639 --> 00:16:30,213
You can do it another way.

232
00:16:30,213 --> 00:16:31,640
You don't have to play games.

233
00:16:31,640 --> 00:16:32,690
You don't know her.

234
00:16:32,690 --> 00:16:33,900
It's good that you do.

235
00:16:33,900 --> 00:16:36,010
Are you implying something?

236
00:16:36,010 --> 00:16:37,569
I think you're enjoying it.

237
00:16:37,569 --> 00:16:38,420
I'm not.

238
00:16:38,420 --> 00:16:40,000
You are.

239
00:16:42,390 --> 00:16:44,929
Some adults will do something immature

240
00:16:44,929 --> 00:16:47,584
when they face the ones they're interested in.

241
00:16:47,584 --> 00:16:51,310
Make fun of her and bully her deliberately.

242
00:16:51,310 --> 00:16:55,100
He'll be happy when he sees her embarrassed or cute.

243
00:16:55,100 --> 00:16:58,899
And he wants to protect her when he sees her miserable.

244
00:16:58,899 --> 00:17:02,200
There's a special term for such men in novels,

245
00:17:02,950 --> 00:17:05,223
that's Elementary School Chicken.

246
00:17:05,940 --> 00:17:08,960
It doesn't sound like a good word.

247
00:17:08,960 --> 00:17:13,230
I don't mean to insult school kids.

248
00:17:14,914 --> 00:17:17,920
Are you teasing me on purpose?

249
00:17:17,920 --> 00:17:19,770
You asked me to be easy.

250
00:17:19,771 --> 00:17:22,050
You may not have that intention.

251
00:17:22,050 --> 00:17:24,790
But we don't know if Dr. Ye will misunderstand you.

252
00:17:24,790 --> 00:17:28,721
After all, she hasn't recovered from the heartbreak.

253
00:17:30,057 --> 00:17:33,141
After chatting with the producer later, do you want to have dinner with him?

254
00:17:33,142 --> 00:17:36,300
No. I've got other plans tonight.

255
00:17:36,300 --> 00:17:37,930
Okay.

256
00:17:47,060 --> 00:17:48,601
- President Gao.
- Is the president here?

257
00:17:48,601 --> 00:17:51,060
He's out.

258
00:17:51,060 --> 00:17:54,209
It's almost time to clock out. He might not come back.

259
00:17:54,209 --> 00:17:56,760
What can I do for you?

260
00:17:57,360 --> 00:17:59,080
Nothing.

261
00:17:59,080 --> 00:18:04,110
By the way, Dr. Ye, how's your job been going?

262
00:18:04,110 --> 00:18:06,190
Settling in?

263
00:18:06,190 --> 00:18:09,670
Yeah. I'm getting used to it.

264
00:18:09,670 --> 00:18:12,784
Assistants meet many people.

265
00:18:12,784 --> 00:18:15,460
Don't be afraid to offend them.

266
00:18:15,460 --> 00:18:20,514
You must help President Lu run the hospital well.

267
00:18:20,514 --> 00:18:22,699
- Sure, I will.
- Okay.

268
00:18:22,699 --> 00:18:24,400
See you.

269
00:18:34,514 --> 00:18:35,900
Hello, President?

270
00:18:35,900 --> 00:18:38,684
<i>- Do you have plans tonight?</i>
- No.

271
00:18:38,685 --> 00:18:40,210
What can I do for you?

272
00:18:40,210 --> 00:18:41,850
<i>Downstairs now and wait for me by the road.</i>

273
00:18:41,850 --> 00:18:43,140
<i>I'll buy you an induction meal.</i>

274
00:18:43,140 --> 00:18:44,700
Okay.

275
00:18:48,660 --> 00:18:50,520
Induction meal.

276
00:18:57,700 --> 00:18:58,870
What's for dinner?

277
00:18:58,870 --> 00:19:01,250
Hotpot, western food, or barbecue?

278
00:19:01,250 --> 00:19:02,680
What do you think?

279
00:19:02,680 --> 00:19:04,210
Barbecue.

280
00:19:05,130 --> 00:19:06,600
Look.

281
00:19:14,071 --> 00:19:15,940
I told you something was strange.

282
00:19:15,940 --> 00:19:20,500
The president is even driving Dr. Ye.

283
00:19:24,750 --> 00:19:26,300
Come on, let's eat.

284
00:19:26,300 --> 00:19:27,900
Let's go.

285
00:19:36,214 --> 00:19:37,950
I want this C set.

286
00:19:37,950 --> 00:19:39,460
Okay.

287
00:19:43,430 --> 00:19:45,540
I'll have the same.

288
00:19:45,540 --> 00:19:47,128
Okay.

289
00:19:48,171 --> 00:19:50,085
Just a moment.

290
00:19:55,300 --> 00:19:57,071
What's wrong?

291
00:19:57,840 --> 00:20:01,620
This entry meal is too costly.

292
00:20:01,620 --> 00:20:04,740
It's not as expensive as your chicken.

293
00:20:06,460 --> 00:20:09,420
President, let me give you the money back.

294
00:20:09,420 --> 00:20:10,940
Okay.

295
00:20:14,100 --> 00:20:16,730
Do you think I need the money?

296
00:20:17,270 --> 00:20:18,385
No.

297
00:20:18,385 --> 00:20:20,920
Or do you want me to owe you?

298
00:20:23,540 --> 00:20:25,290
No.

299
00:20:28,057 --> 00:20:32,620
But it's really a steep price for the chicken.

300
00:20:34,671 --> 00:20:35,960
I'll pay you back half.

301
00:20:35,960 --> 00:20:37,760
I think it works.

302
00:20:38,728 --> 00:20:40,640
I want cash.

303
00:20:42,460 --> 00:20:45,760
Okay. I'll go to withdraw the cash now.

304
00:20:47,870 --> 00:20:50,257
Are you silly?

305
00:20:56,530 --> 00:20:57,890
I was just kidding.

306
00:20:57,890 --> 00:21:00,550
Sit down and eat.

307
00:21:28,060 --> 00:21:30,590
<i>Some adults will do something immature</i>

308
00:21:30,591 --> 00:21:33,343

309
00:21:33,343 --> 00:21:37,260

<i>that's Elementary School Chicken.</i>

314
00:22:09,700 --> 00:22:14,185
Assistant Ye, I treat you to this induction meal

315
00:22:14,185 --> 00:22:16,920
because I want to make something clear.

316
00:22:18,485 --> 00:22:21,430
Do you know why I wanted you to be my assistant?

317
00:22:21,430 --> 00:22:23,830
Didn't you tell me last time?

318
00:22:23,830 --> 00:22:27,400
To make it easy to get back at me.

319
00:22:27,400 --> 00:22:29,210
That's your own speculation.

320
00:22:29,210 --> 00:22:31,230
I didn't say that.

321
00:22:31,230 --> 00:22:33,310
Then, what was it for?

322
00:22:35,300 --> 00:22:40,680
Because... although you're a bit reckless,

323
00:22:40,680 --> 00:22:42,541
you're honest and kind.

324
00:22:42,541 --> 00:22:44,350
You're very dedicated and loving.

325
00:22:44,350 --> 00:22:47,680
And you have a sense of justice.

326
00:22:48,514 --> 00:22:50,730
I have so many advantages.

327
00:22:52,085 --> 00:22:54,710
You're making me flush.

328
00:22:55,971 --> 00:22:58,060
I don't mean to compliment you.

329
00:22:58,700 --> 00:23:00,530
I...

330
00:23:00,530 --> 00:23:02,760
I just want to explain.

331
00:23:02,760 --> 00:23:04,828
I simply admire you.

332
00:23:04,828 --> 00:23:07,040
Don't have other misunderstandings.

333
00:23:07,040 --> 00:23:09,400
What other misunderstandings?

334
00:23:11,071 --> 00:23:13,899
Like, sometimes you thought I was scaring you deliberately.

335
00:23:13,899 --> 00:23:17,940
Or even joking in a childish way, like a school kid.

336
00:23:17,940 --> 00:23:22,280
I admit it made me happy to get back at you.

337
00:23:22,280 --> 00:23:26,050
Actually, it's because of my personality.

338
00:23:26,050 --> 00:23:28,909
Not because you're different. It has nothing to do with you.

339
00:23:28,909 --> 00:23:30,860
Can you understand?

340
00:23:30,860 --> 00:23:32,385
I understand.

341
00:23:34,600 --> 00:23:36,371
What do you understand?

342
00:23:36,371 --> 00:23:40,200
You mean you're not an Elementary School Chicken.

343
00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:44,350
You messed with me, not because you like me. Right?

344
00:23:45,970 --> 00:23:48,090
You know that?

345
00:23:49,320 --> 00:23:52,042
My best girlfriend writes...

346
00:23:53,457 --> 00:23:55,541
engages in literature.

347
00:23:55,542 --> 00:23:57,760
She told me about it.

348
00:24:05,885 --> 00:24:10,885
However, President, why do you think I'd get you wrong?

349
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:14,540
I was just saying it.

350
00:24:16,350 --> 00:24:19,584
Well, you admire me, you wanted me to be your assistant.

351
00:24:19,584 --> 00:24:21,442
How are they related?

352
00:24:27,660 --> 00:24:32,671
I thought you could join me to build a better Anxing Hospital.

353
00:24:32,671 --> 00:24:35,160
A better Anxing Hospital?

354
00:24:35,900 --> 00:24:38,057
The job of doctors is to treat illnesses.

355
00:24:38,057 --> 00:24:40,380
You all do well at this.

356
00:24:40,380 --> 00:24:42,328
I, as an administrator,

357
00:24:42,328 --> 00:24:44,639
I'm responsible for offering you a pleasant

358
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:47,371
working environment and working atmosphere.

359
00:24:47,371 --> 00:24:51,200
Let you get more respect and better rewards.

360
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:53,489
Let you work happily in the hospital

361
00:24:53,489 --> 00:24:56,410
and have enough time to enjoy yourselves.

362
00:24:56,410 --> 00:25:00,320
I know there are a lot of problems in the hospital right now.

363
00:25:00,320 --> 00:25:02,627
You have your own experience and feelings.

364
00:25:02,628 --> 00:25:05,280
It's time to make some changes.

365
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:07,520
So I'd like to invite you

366
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:11,557
to give me some inspiration and advice from the perspective of employees.

367
00:25:11,557 --> 00:25:13,730
Are you willing to help me?

368
00:25:14,885 --> 00:25:16,760
Yes, I am.

369
00:25:21,628 --> 00:25:25,357
Chief Huang does like asking us to help with his things.

370
00:25:25,357 --> 00:25:29,230
Although everyone was complaining, no one refused him.

371
00:25:29,230 --> 00:25:31,040
Why?

372
00:25:31,040 --> 00:25:33,130
Scheduling, evaluation,

373
00:25:33,130 --> 00:25:36,099
and performance reviews are all up to him.

374
00:25:36,099 --> 00:25:38,580
He can't be offended.

375
00:25:38,580 --> 00:25:41,410
Chief Huang seems more vindictive than I am.

376
00:25:41,410 --> 00:25:43,140
He's different from you.

377
00:25:43,140 --> 00:25:46,513
His requests are orders in Pediatrics.

378
00:25:46,514 --> 00:25:48,550
We must carry them out.

379
00:25:49,380 --> 00:25:52,610
And he likes to call us young doctors to eat together.

380
00:25:52,610 --> 00:25:56,370
He calls it team building.

381
00:25:56,370 --> 00:25:58,460
You don't like team dinners?

382
00:25:58,460 --> 00:26:00,250
It's okay once in a while.

383
00:26:00,250 --> 00:26:05,310
But he likes it whether he's happy or angry.

384
00:26:05,310 --> 00:26:07,310
It's always short notice.

385
00:26:07,310 --> 00:26:09,884
We have to cancel our plans.

386
00:26:09,885 --> 00:26:15,290
And we have to blow his ego when he brags at the table.

387
00:26:15,880 --> 00:26:18,713
Think about it. We don't have personal lives.

388
00:26:18,713 --> 00:26:21,029
We have to eat with the ones we don't like.

389
00:26:21,029 --> 00:26:23,185
We need to act without overtime pay.

390
00:26:23,185 --> 00:26:25,490
How can we not be upset?

391
00:26:27,180 --> 00:26:30,730
No wonder you were not happy when you came back.

392
00:26:32,010 --> 00:26:34,270
It doesn't matter.

393
00:26:34,270 --> 00:26:39,280
For employees, working happily is a luxury.

394
00:26:39,280 --> 00:26:43,220
I saw you quite happy in Taoyuan Village.

395
00:26:43,220 --> 00:26:47,842
Life there was simple. I just needed to do my job.

396
00:26:47,842 --> 00:26:49,849
But besides base salary,

397
00:26:49,849 --> 00:26:52,527
I got a little bonus, it was just a token.

398
00:26:52,527 --> 00:26:54,485
I can't always stay there.

399
00:26:54,485 --> 00:26:56,550
Because you want to buy a house, right?

400
00:26:56,550 --> 00:26:58,000
How did you know?

401
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:00,539
You said it when you drank in secret that night.

402
00:27:00,539 --> 00:27:01,709
You drank, too.

403
00:27:01,710 --> 00:27:04,980
Yeah. I'm an accomplice, okay?

404
00:27:06,700 --> 00:27:10,330
The director gave me a bottle of wine before I left.

405
00:27:10,330 --> 00:27:13,000
She asked me to keep it secret.

406
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:16,050
And that's when I realized, she didn't know

407
00:27:16,050 --> 00:27:18,290
the deputy director raided her liquor.

408
00:27:18,290 --> 00:27:21,680
Well, the deputy director is interesting.

409
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:26,930
He is, but he's ungrateful.

410
00:27:26,930 --> 00:27:28,571
I called him yesterday.

411
00:27:28,571 --> 00:27:31,730
He's living a relaxing life.

412
00:27:31,730 --> 00:27:35,010
He even said the new Dr. Su does everything he says.

413
00:27:35,010 --> 00:27:36,710
All the compliments.

414
00:27:36,710 --> 00:27:40,430
Sounds like I always tortured them when I was there.

415
00:27:52,970 --> 00:27:56,210
Wait. Is your best girlfriend at home?

416
00:27:56,210 --> 00:27:57,460
She should be.

417
00:27:57,460 --> 00:27:59,110
Good.

418
00:28:23,540 --> 00:28:26,341
One box for one cup. Ten boxes in all.

419
00:28:26,341 --> 00:28:29,870
I bought every flavor in case you'd get tired of it.

420
00:28:29,870 --> 00:28:32,010
- You remember it?
- Of course.

421
00:28:32,010 --> 00:28:35,230
I wrote an IOU. I must pay you back.

422
00:28:35,985 --> 00:28:38,080
I can't eat all of these.

423
00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:39,470
Take your time.

424
00:28:39,470 --> 00:28:42,990
They're fresh and they have an 18-month shelf life.

425
00:28:45,580 --> 00:28:47,450
Okay.

426
00:28:52,910 --> 00:28:56,127
All right. All the instant noodles are paid off from now on.

427
00:28:56,127 --> 00:29:00,000
The debt I owed you in Taoyuan Village is settled.

428
00:29:01,060 --> 00:29:04,920
It's settled?

429
00:29:04,920 --> 00:29:06,290
Do you think it's not enough?

430
00:29:06,290 --> 00:29:08,210
No, it's enough!

431
00:29:09,110 --> 00:29:10,871
I've learned my lesson.

432
00:29:13,471 --> 00:29:17,230
Ye Shilan, I find that you always focus on the negative side

433
00:29:17,230 --> 00:29:19,890
when you think about things.

434
00:29:20,620 --> 00:29:23,814
You got me wrong and wanted to change me in Taoyuan Village,

435
00:29:23,814 --> 00:29:26,660
but you helped me a lot, actually.

436
00:29:26,660 --> 00:29:28,490
You cared for me.

437
00:29:28,490 --> 00:29:30,930
You didn't really hurt me.

438
00:29:30,930 --> 00:29:34,170
But you only seem to remember your hatred of me.

439
00:29:34,171 --> 00:29:36,530
You thought I'd really get back at you.

440
00:29:38,285 --> 00:29:40,180
I seem to be like this all the time.

441
00:29:40,180 --> 00:29:42,210
I'm used to it.

442
00:29:42,210 --> 00:29:44,557
Try to think positively.

443
00:29:44,557 --> 00:29:46,840
Maybe you'll be happier.

444
00:29:48,970 --> 00:29:50,080
Bye.

445
00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:51,680
See you tomorrow.

446
00:30:25,290 --> 00:30:28,529
I was wondering why he suddenly stopped explaining

447
00:30:28,529 --> 00:30:32,229
when he knew I was a doctor of Anxing Hospital in Taoyuan Village.

448
00:30:32,230 --> 00:30:33,813
He went with my words.

449
00:30:33,813 --> 00:30:37,728
He tried to ask about the hospital by beating around the bush.

450
00:30:37,728 --> 00:30:41,357
Turns out he wanted to know about the problems of the hospital

451
00:30:41,357 --> 00:30:43,920
to improve our working environment.

452
00:30:43,920 --> 00:30:46,719
All right. You've been complimenting him all the way.

453
00:30:46,719 --> 00:30:49,470
What? You like Lu Zhaoxi?

454
00:30:49,470 --> 00:30:51,640
How's it possible?

455
00:30:52,210 --> 00:30:56,790
I just simply admire him.

456
00:30:58,130 --> 00:30:59,420
I'm a little hungry.

457
00:30:59,420 --> 00:31:00,900
Do you want one?

458
00:31:00,900 --> 00:31:02,560
No.

459
00:31:02,560 --> 00:31:04,610
I had a big meal tonight.

460
00:31:04,610 --> 00:31:06,660
Lu Zhaoxi treated you?

461
00:31:06,660 --> 00:31:08,360
Induction meal.

462
00:31:08,360 --> 00:31:11,829
You were worried Lu Zhaoxi might take revenge on you.

463
00:31:11,830 --> 00:31:15,470
Now, it seems like he's been rewarding you.

464
00:31:15,470 --> 00:31:17,749
He's just a man who likes teasing people.

465
00:31:17,749 --> 00:31:20,310
He's a paper tiger.

466
00:31:20,310 --> 00:31:24,290
Or... he's more like a fox.

467
00:31:24,290 --> 00:31:26,459
And he wants to be a good president.

468
00:31:26,459 --> 00:31:28,160
He needs my help.

469
00:31:28,160 --> 00:31:30,030
So simple?

470
00:31:30,030 --> 00:31:31,500
Yeah.

471
00:31:31,500 --> 00:31:34,770
And he explained it to me,

472
00:31:34,770 --> 00:31:38,260
in case I'd think he had a thing for me.

473
00:31:39,820 --> 00:31:42,171
Explained?

474
00:31:42,971 --> 00:31:45,485
He must have something to hide.

475
00:31:45,970 --> 00:31:49,820
He's excellent. He must have had many admirers.

476
00:31:49,820 --> 00:31:52,269
It was probably a problem for him.

477
00:31:52,269 --> 00:31:56,170
A great fox.

478
00:31:57,730 --> 00:32:00,270
Did you read Little Prince?

479
00:32:00,270 --> 00:32:03,129
The fox got to know the prince and created connections with him.

480
00:32:03,129 --> 00:32:06,084
It was tamed gradually in the process.

481
00:32:06,084 --> 00:32:08,156
And then, inevitably, they developed an attachment

482
00:32:08,156 --> 00:32:11,757
and became unique to each other.

483
00:32:11,757 --> 00:32:14,210
Stop expanding it.

484
00:32:14,210 --> 00:32:16,179
You think there must be love

485
00:32:16,179 --> 00:32:18,010
once you see a man and a woman together.

486
00:32:18,010 --> 00:32:19,730
Love is beautiful.

487
00:32:19,730 --> 00:32:22,810
I want it. That's why I write romance novels.

488
00:32:22,810 --> 00:32:24,699
And from my experience,

489
00:32:24,699 --> 00:32:26,970
if there's no conflict between two characters,

490
00:32:26,971 --> 00:32:29,249
they must fall in love or the readers will run away.

491
00:32:29,249 --> 00:32:31,580
Stop thinking about your novel. Eat.

492
00:32:31,580 --> 00:32:33,610
They're going to be bloated.

493
00:32:35,460 --> 00:32:40,010
You should take half of them.

494
00:32:40,610 --> 00:32:42,710
No problem.

00:33:13,710 --> 00:33:16,650
- Morning.
- Morning, President.

500
00:33:16,700 --> 00:33:18,550
You like holly?

501
00:33:18,550 --> 00:33:20,628
I like all the beautiful flowers.

502
00:33:20,628 --> 00:33:23,700
Holly means resilience.

503
00:33:23,700 --> 00:33:26,242
It'll be replaced in a few days.

504
00:33:26,242 --> 00:33:28,589
I bought it from the flower base online.

505
00:33:28,590 --> 00:33:31,229
It arrived the next day. I just need to trim it.

506
00:33:31,230 --> 00:33:33,642
Cheaper than flower shops outside.

507
00:33:33,642 --> 00:33:35,971
You're trying to save money for me?

508
00:33:35,971 --> 00:33:38,528
Frugality is also a virtue.

509
00:33:38,528 --> 00:33:41,060
I'll leave if there's nothing else.

510
00:33:42,114 --> 00:33:46,228
By the way, do you have Chief Huang's new book?

511
00:33:46,228 --> 00:33:49,800
No. I haven't bought it yet.

512
00:33:49,800 --> 00:33:51,660
He didn't send you one?

513
00:33:51,660 --> 00:33:55,940
We all bought it ourselves to increase its sales.

514
00:33:58,010 --> 00:33:59,999
Go borrow one from him for me.

515
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:02,230
Tell him I'd like to read it.

516
00:34:02,230 --> 00:34:03,660
Okay.

517
00:34:13,600 --> 00:34:16,470
President Lu doesn't know medicine.

518
00:34:16,470 --> 00:34:18,370
Why would he read my book?

519
00:34:18,370 --> 00:34:19,713
I don't know.

520
00:34:19,714 --> 00:34:23,028
He said he wanted to read it. So he asked me to borrow one.

521
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:34,040
Since he asked for it, I have to sign it.

522
00:34:35,840 --> 00:34:41,020
Dr. Ye, although now you're his assistant,

523
00:34:41,020 --> 00:34:44,709
you're still a member of the Department of Pediatrics.

524
00:34:44,710 --> 00:34:47,000
You'll eventually come back here.

525
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:49,973
Read more books. Don't gossip.

526
00:34:49,973 --> 00:34:53,073
Don't waste your professional skills.

527
00:34:53,710 --> 00:34:55,810
I will, Chief Huang.

528
00:34:55,810 --> 00:34:58,840
- Give it to the president.
- I'll be off then.

529
00:35:08,070 --> 00:35:11,180
- Sit.
- Let's continue.

530
00:35:13,190 --> 00:35:16,279
Jiang, let me ask you.

531
00:35:16,280 --> 00:35:21,760
Do you know why Dr. Ye wanted to be an assistant?

532
00:35:23,230 --> 00:35:24,542
I don't know.

533
00:35:24,542 --> 00:35:26,257
I don't usually talk to her.

534
00:35:26,257 --> 00:35:27,740
How could you not communicate?

535
00:35:27,740 --> 00:35:29,469
I told you many times,

536
00:35:29,470 --> 00:35:33,799
colleagues should connect with each other more often.

537
00:35:33,800 --> 00:35:36,130
And eat together often.

538
00:35:36,130 --> 00:35:38,840
Care more about each other.

539
00:35:38,840 --> 00:35:40,520
Yeah.

540
00:35:42,710 --> 00:35:46,059
All right. That's all for the seminar.

541
00:35:46,059 --> 00:35:47,560
Go back to work.

542
00:35:47,560 --> 00:35:50,980
Okay. I'll be off then, Chief.

543
00:36:04,390 --> 00:36:06,519
Go to the Pediatrics office this afternoon

544
00:36:06,520 --> 00:36:09,530
and ask around about the President's Mailbox.

545
00:36:09,530 --> 00:36:11,080
Okay.

546
00:36:16,528 --> 00:36:18,770
Eating with the leader is stressing you out?

547
00:36:18,770 --> 00:36:20,871
You eat fast every time.

548
00:36:21,500 --> 00:36:23,980
No. I'm used to eating fast.

549
00:36:23,980 --> 00:36:27,220
But for others, it'd stress them out.

550
00:36:27,220 --> 00:36:28,885
Why?

551
00:36:28,885 --> 00:36:31,628
Eating is supposed to be happy and relaxing.

552
00:36:31,628 --> 00:36:34,200
But leaders talk about work, whether they mean to or not.

553
00:36:34,200 --> 00:36:35,710
That's part one.

554
00:36:35,710 --> 00:36:37,149
Although some enlightened leaders

555
00:36:37,150 --> 00:36:39,530
will ask subordinates to make themselves comfortable,

556
00:36:39,530 --> 00:36:41,770
in fact, there's a line on both sides.

557
00:36:41,770 --> 00:36:44,914
Once you cross it, the leader will be unhappy.

558
00:36:44,914 --> 00:36:47,471
So subordinates have no way of relaxing.

559
00:36:47,471 --> 00:36:48,942
That's part two.

560
00:36:48,942 --> 00:36:53,220
Of course, there are some weird leaders, they're exceptions.

561
00:36:54,571 --> 00:36:57,500
Don't take it personally.

562
00:36:57,500 --> 00:36:59,940
You're obviously talking about me.

563
00:36:59,940 --> 00:37:05,057
So, did I outline when I talked about you and Assistant Ye?

564
00:37:05,057 --> 00:37:08,660
No. But you missed the point.

565
00:37:09,642 --> 00:37:13,190
I think it's too early to draw a conclusion.

566
00:37:16,080 --> 00:37:19,910
Assistant Lin, I find your brain on gossip

567
00:37:19,910 --> 00:37:22,142
is totally different from that on work.

568
00:37:22,142 --> 00:37:24,460
You seem to be in another world.

569
00:37:24,460 --> 00:37:25,980
Really?

570
00:37:25,980 --> 00:37:27,928
Is it not so?

571
00:37:27,928 --> 00:37:29,570
It doesn't matter.

572
00:37:31,485 --> 00:37:35,430
President, do you usually carry band-aids around with you?

573
00:37:35,430 --> 00:37:37,940
What? Where are you hurt?

574
00:37:37,940 --> 00:37:40,670
No. I'm just asking.

575
00:37:48,630 --> 00:37:50,850
I'm done. I have to go first.

576
00:37:50,850 --> 00:37:52,360
Okay.

577
00:38:07,470 --> 00:38:09,980
Hello, what would you like?

578
00:38:11,910 --> 00:38:14,220
We just restocked the strawberries, very fresh.

579
00:38:14,220 --> 00:38:16,642
Strawberry smoothie as usual?

580
00:38:16,642 --> 00:38:17,860
<i>[Yao Jiajia]</i>

581
00:38:20,085 --> 00:38:22,914
You've been here several times. I remember you.

582
00:38:23,800 --> 00:38:27,559
I'll have an iced Americano, triple espresso.

583
00:38:27,560 --> 00:38:28,740
Take away.

584
00:38:28,740 --> 00:38:30,920
That much? It might be a little bitter.

585
00:38:30,920 --> 00:38:32,570
It's okay.

586
00:38:32,570 --> 00:38:34,328
Okay.

587
00:38:40,114 --> 00:38:41,757
Just a moment.

588
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:07,420
Triple iced Americano.

589
00:39:08,120 --> 00:39:10,840
- Thank you.
- Bye.

590
00:39:23,880 --> 00:39:26,227
No amount of strawberry milkshake

591
00:39:26,228 --> 00:39:29,420
heals the pain inside Kevin.

592
00:39:29,420 --> 00:39:33,220
Sometimes he needs an espresso iced Americano...

593
00:39:34,630 --> 00:39:39,000
to remind himself of his miserable years.

594
00:39:43,090 --> 00:39:46,130
It's nice. Good job.

595
00:39:46,130 --> 00:39:47,471
Thank you.

596
00:39:47,471 --> 00:39:49,899
I'll go to supervise the cleaning at your home later.

597
00:39:49,899 --> 00:39:52,460
Call me if there's anything.

598
00:39:52,460 --> 00:39:53,940
Okay.

599
00:39:55,120 --> 00:39:56,549
- Chief Huang.
- Chief Huang.

600
00:39:56,549 --> 00:39:59,470
- President Lu.
- How can I help you?

601
00:39:59,470 --> 00:40:00,800
I'd like to have a chat with you.

602
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:02,471
Come on, sit over there.

603
00:40:02,471 --> 00:40:04,814
- Ye Shilan.
- I'll go to make some tea.

604
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:13,371
Well, I didn't expect

605
00:40:13,371 --> 00:40:16,700
President Lu was so interested in medical books.

606
00:40:16,700 --> 00:40:18,370
Just for fun.

607
00:40:18,370 --> 00:40:21,430
Technically, that's a book on popular science.

608
00:40:21,430 --> 00:40:22,940
That's right.

609
00:40:22,940 --> 00:40:25,740
It's simple and useful.

610
00:40:25,740 --> 00:40:28,660
That's what the readers say.

611
00:40:28,660 --> 00:40:31,470
You're so busy every day. And you can write several books a year.

612
00:40:31,470 --> 00:40:33,460
I admire you so much.

613
00:40:34,470 --> 00:40:37,885
Well, to popularize medical knowledge.

614
00:40:37,885 --> 00:40:40,130
To be honest, since I published this book,

615
00:40:40,130 --> 00:40:42,671
many readers know I'm the Chief of Pediatrics

616
00:40:42,671 --> 00:40:45,457
in Anxing Hospital after they read it.

617
00:40:45,457 --> 00:40:48,685
They make appointments with me to diagnose them.

618
00:40:48,685 --> 00:40:52,856
It's our honor to have a famous doctor like you.

619
00:40:52,857 --> 00:40:54,414
Thank you, President.

620
00:40:54,414 --> 00:40:57,740
By the way, why do you want to see me?

621
00:40:58,857 --> 00:41:02,142
Well, I'm talking to you.

622
00:41:02,142 --> 00:41:03,814
I almost forgot why I was here.

623
00:41:03,814 --> 00:41:07,785
I heard Assistant Lin went to the Department of Pediatrics

624
00:41:07,785 --> 00:41:10,284
and asked many pediatricians for advice.

625
00:41:10,285 --> 00:41:13,039
President, you're so concerned about Pediatrics.

626
00:41:13,040 --> 00:41:17,313
As the chief, I wish I could get feedback

627
00:41:17,314 --> 00:41:20,214
and see what else I can do for you.

628
00:41:20,214 --> 00:41:22,828
Chief Huang, you're so kind.

629
00:41:22,828 --> 00:41:24,514
However,

630
00:41:25,728 --> 00:41:27,060
do you want the truth?

631
00:41:27,060 --> 00:41:28,671
Of course.

632
00:41:29,400 --> 00:41:35,300
Someone from Pediatrics said you assigned the task of arranging the materials for your book to the team.

633
00:41:35,314 --> 00:41:37,414
Is that true?
