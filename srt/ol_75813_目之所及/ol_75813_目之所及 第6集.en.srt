answer my question first.

170
00:17:56,020 --> 00:17:57,150
Did you kill him?

171
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:05,750
Yes.

172
00:18:07,590 --> 00:18:08,520
How did you do it?

173
00:18:10,030 --> 00:18:10,790
Poison.

174
00:18:11,960 --> 00:18:13,090
Where did you put it?

175
00:18:18,590 --> 00:18:20,720
You don't need to be so guarded with me.

176
00:18:21,240 --> 00:18:22,770
I didn't get along with him.

177
00:18:23,270 --> 00:18:24,440
In a way,

178
00:18:24,460 --> 00:18:25,680
I had a grudge against him.

179
00:18:25,680 --> 00:18:26,700
So I came to see him,

180
00:18:26,700 --> 00:18:28,030
not for a friendly chat.

181
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:29,660
The reason I tied you up

182
00:18:29,920 --> 00:18:31,060
is so you would calmly

183
00:18:31,060 --> 00:18:32,590
listen to what I have to say.

184
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:35,920
I mean no harm.

185
00:18:36,680 --> 00:18:37,410
Understand?

186
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:52,100
I put the poison in his cup.

187
00:18:55,920 --> 00:18:57,440
I planned to die with him.

188
00:19:04,750 --> 00:19:06,210
But then I changed my mind.

189
00:19:13,830 --> 00:19:14,920
I washed the cup,

190
00:19:15,590 --> 00:19:17,190
but he still died afterward.

191
00:19:19,270 --> 00:19:21,530
Maybe I didn't clean the cup thoroughly.

192
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:32,000
Is today a special occasion?

193
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,800
He even brought a bottle of wine.

194
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,330
If what you said is true,

195
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:42,480
the person who killed Su Muxin

196
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:43,480
might not be you.

197
00:19:45,790 --> 00:19:46,920
Was the wine he drank

198
00:19:47,750 --> 00:19:49,160
brought from outside?

199
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:57,760
How do you know?

200
00:19:59,470 --> 00:20:01,470
I followed him from Hesheng Street,

201
00:20:05,270 --> 00:20:06,110
where Su Muxin's

202
00:20:06,110 --> 00:20:07,270
lover lives,

203
00:20:07,590 --> 00:20:08,590
all the way here.

204
00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:10,310
When he came back,

205
00:20:10,310 --> 00:20:11,510
he brought a bottle of wine.

206
00:20:11,510 --> 00:20:13,000
So what poisoned Su Muxin

207
00:20:13,590 --> 00:20:14,960
might not be your cup,

208
00:20:15,960 --> 00:20:17,290
but that bottle of wine.

209
00:20:24,920 --> 00:20:26,310
Then let's call the police.

210
00:20:26,310 --> 00:20:26,880
No,

211
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,400
we can't call the police.

212
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:29,880
You had a motive to kill,

213
00:20:29,880 --> 00:20:31,270
and you actually attempted it.

214
00:20:31,270 --> 00:20:33,270
You won't be able to explain yourself
to the police.

215
00:20:33,270 --> 00:20:34,310
It's also bad for me,

216
00:20:34,310 --> 00:20:36,310
who suddenly appeared at the scene.

217
00:20:36,830 --> 00:20:37,610
Now both of us need to save ourselves.

218
00:20:37,610 --> 00:20:38,320
We need to

219
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:40,160
find the real killer.

220
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:41,620
If you agree,

221
00:20:42,160 --> 00:20:43,310
I can untie you.

222
00:20:44,750 --> 00:20:45,950
I can't see anything,

223
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:48,300
and I'm not familiar with this place.

224
00:20:48,830 --> 00:20:50,630
You need to help me clean this up.

225
00:20:55,830 --> 00:20:57,400
Moving him today isn't realistic.

226
00:20:57,400 --> 00:20:58,860
We have nowhere to put him.

227
00:20:59,550 --> 00:21:01,080
We need to preserve the body

228
00:21:01,510 --> 00:21:02,510
and not damage it.

229
00:21:03,350 --> 00:21:04,550
This is the top floor.

230
00:21:05,550 --> 00:21:06,950
Is there a rooftop above?

231
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:08,400
And is there a water tank?

232
00:21:09,920 --> 00:21:10,790
I think there's one

233
00:21:10,790 --> 00:21:12,050
for flushing toilets.

234
00:21:13,350 --> 00:21:15,880
We can only keep it there
for three days at most.

235
00:21:15,880 --> 00:21:16,940
The weather is hot,

236
00:21:17,270 --> 00:21:18,960
so the body will decompose quickly.

237
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:20,020
Within three days,

238
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:21,850
I'll find a suitable place

239
00:21:21,850 --> 00:21:22,790
to move him.

240
00:21:23,510 --> 00:21:24,710
Take off his clothes.

241
00:21:41,720 --> 00:21:42,720
Do I look like him?

242
00:21:47,110 --> 00:21:47,790
Very much.

243
00:22:13,310 --> 00:22:14,570
The clothes we removed

244
00:22:14,790 --> 00:22:16,120
must all be disposed of.

245
00:22:17,030 --> 00:22:18,030
If possible,

246
00:22:18,440 --> 00:22:19,440
burn everything.

247
00:22:20,070 --> 00:22:21,590
After securing all the evidence,

248
00:22:21,590 --> 00:22:23,190
thoroughly clean the house.

250
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:31,240
Okay.

251

Do you have any Baijiu at home?

252
00:22:46,160 --> 00:22:46,840
Put it on.

253
00:22:56,310 --> 00:22:57,640
Double-check it again.

254
00:22:58,200 --> 00:22:59,260
Is it at 10 o'clock?

255

Muxin.

256

The power will be out at 10 tonight.

257

Will you come back and stay with me?

Where...where are we going now?

To do a DNA test.

Right.

Just need to draw some blood.

Su Muxin's records don't show

269
00:23:23,680 --> 00:23:24,750
that he has a twin brother,

270
00:23:24,750 --> 00:23:26,590
and none of the people
around him know either.

How old were they
when they were separated?

272
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:29,400
Two or three years old.

273

Very young anyway.

the specific circumstances back then?

It's pretty much what you'd expect.

My brother...

278

He loved to drink.

She couldn't take Mufan with her,

282
00:24:29,350 --> 00:24:30,810
so she ran away with Muxin.

283

Back then,

284
00:24:32,830 --> 00:24:34,480
traveling wasn't convenient,

285
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:36,440
so my brother didn't go looking for them

286
00:24:36,440 --> 00:24:38,300
and just raised Mufan by himself.

Nothing.

floating population records here?

294
00:24:48,750 --> 00:24:49,550
Our computer system

295

was just acquired this year,

296
00:24:51,110 --> 00:24:52,310

haven't been organized yet,

300

so you have to check the archives.

301

If we search that way,

302

with his mother, Chen Li.

No, I haven't.

in 1986,

the two brothers must have met.
