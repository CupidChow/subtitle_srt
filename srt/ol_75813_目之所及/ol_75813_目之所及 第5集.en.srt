Even now,

352
00:16:00,440 --> 00:16:01,900
the opposite conclusion.

353
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:05,270

360

Today, I think I...

361
00:16:25,840 --> 00:16:27,570
I've been too self-righteous,

362
00:16:29,260 --> 00:16:31,520
refusing to listen to others' opinions,

363
00:16:31,670 --> 00:16:33,730

for a long time, haven't you?

365

No. Not at all.

369
00:16:46,550 --> 00:16:48,880
Your intuition has always been accurate.

370

374
00:17:04,790 --> 00:17:06,990

Why do I trust my intuition?

388

Because since childhood,

389
00:18:13,830 --> 00:18:15,270

00:28:05,030 --> 00:28:06,160
Who would care?

520
00:28:06,160 --> 00:28:07,200
In this world,

521
00:28:07,310 --> 00:28:08,920
everyone else is an outsider.

522
00:28:08,920 --> 00:28:10,980
Only you and I are connected by blood.

523
00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:13,530
The promises I madeâ€”

524
00:28:13,550 --> 00:28:14,800
I can still keep them!

525
00:28:14,920 --> 00:28:16,160
I told Mom today

526
00:28:16,230 --> 00:28:17,400
what I promised her

527
00:28:17,680 --> 00:28:18,750
still stands.

528
00:28:19,070 --> 00:28:20,600
Actually, all these years,

529
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:22,220
I often thought of you.

530
00:28:22,310 --> 00:28:23,910
I hoped you were still alive,

531
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:25,680
so at least there would be someone

532
00:28:25,680 --> 00:28:26,750
I could talk to.

533
00:28:27,350 --> 00:28:28,240
Some people say twins

534
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:29,000
have telepathic connections.

535
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:30,130
Do you believe that?

536
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:31,900
I regret it.

537
00:28:32,070 --> 00:28:33,960
I really do.

538
00:28:36,790 --> 00:28:37,720
There's no point

539
00:28:38,680 --> 00:28:40,340
bringing up the past anymore.

540
00:28:41,480 --> 00:28:43,080
We should look ahead, right?

541
00:28:43,750 --> 00:28:44,750
If you want money,

542
00:28:45,030 --> 00:28:46,350
I'll do everything I can.

543
00:28:46,350 --> 00:28:48,270
Consider it my way of making amends.

544
00:28:48,270 --> 00:28:49,400
As for other things,

545
00:28:51,640 --> 00:28:53,240
we can talk about them later.

546
00:28:55,750 --> 00:28:57,210
As long as you're willing.

547
00:29:01,830 --> 00:29:02,920
Let's meet,

548
00:29:03,750 --> 00:29:04,310
okay?

549
00:29:09,720 --> 00:29:10,350
Sure.

550
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:13,170
Let's meet then.

551
00:30:12,790 --> 00:30:13,320
Xiaowei.

552
00:30:14,310 --> 00:30:15,960
I've modified it the way you said.

553
00:30:15,960 --> 00:30:17,440
It can knock someone out in an instant,

554
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:19,100
but it won't cause any injury.

555
00:30:19,160 --> 00:30:21,640
You asked around
for his phone number at Zhuo'er.

556
00:30:21,640 --> 00:30:23,100
Could that cause trouble?

557
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:24,030
No.

558
00:30:24,750 --> 00:30:26,110
I've taken care of everything.

559
00:30:26,110 --> 00:30:27,510
It shouldn't be an issue.

560
00:30:28,590 --> 00:30:30,920
Are you sure
you only ran into him briefly?

561
00:30:32,790 --> 00:30:33,590
Yes, I'm sure.

562
00:30:35,640 --> 00:30:36,640
That bossâ€”

563
00:30:37,680 --> 00:30:39,830
he won't go digging
into my household records, will he?

564
00:30:39,830 --> 00:30:40,510
No,

565
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:42,100
he's not a police officer.

566
00:30:42,830 --> 00:30:44,070
But for the time being,

567
00:30:44,070 --> 00:30:45,870
you'd better keep a low profile.

568
00:30:47,720 --> 00:30:48,270
Okay.

569
00:31:36,160 --> 00:31:36,720
Aunt!

570
00:31:39,070 --> 00:31:40,400
Why are you back so late?

571
00:31:45,830 --> 00:31:47,310
Xiaoling asked me
to save some food for you.

572
00:31:47,310 --> 00:31:49,720
If it were up to me,
I wouldn't have left you any.

573
00:31:49,720 --> 00:31:51,270
Uncle and Xiaoling are already asleep?

574
00:31:51,270 --> 00:31:51,720
Yes.

575
00:31:52,590 --> 00:31:53,110
Eat.

576
00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:55,240
Look at you.

577
00:31:56,070 --> 00:31:57,200
You can't see,

578
00:31:57,480 --> 00:31:59,160
yet you're always running around outside.

579
00:31:59,160 --> 00:32:00,960
You'll spend money if you go out.

580
00:32:01,110 --> 00:32:03,370
When can you ever save anything that way?

581
00:32:05,480 --> 00:32:06,210
Why don't you

582
00:32:06,510 --> 00:32:07,570
give me your money?

583
00:32:07,920 --> 00:32:09,180
I'll manage it for you.

584
00:32:12,200 --> 00:32:13,960
Quit grinning like that.

585
00:32:23,880 --> 00:32:24,590
Here, fish.

586
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:25,880
Do you know how much grass carp sells

587
00:32:25,880 --> 00:32:27,400
for per 500 grams at the market now?

588
00:32:27,400 --> 00:32:27,750
Here.

589
00:32:27,920 --> 00:32:28,240
Eat.

590
00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:29,440
Eat some fish.

591
00:32:32,830 --> 00:32:33,590
Wait a moment.

592
00:32:33,590 --> 00:32:34,550
What's the rush?

593
00:32:34,680 --> 00:32:35,280
No need.

594
00:32:35,310 --> 00:32:35,920
No need for what?

595
00:32:35,920 --> 00:32:37,080
Can you even see?

596
00:32:37,160 --> 00:32:38,200
If a fishbone gets stuck in your throat,

597
00:32:38,200 --> 00:32:39,000
you'll have to go to the hospital.

598
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:40,550
Going to the hospital to remove it

599
00:32:40,550 --> 00:32:41,640
means paying medical fees.

600
00:32:41,640 --> 00:32:42,480
And who's going to cover that?

601
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:43,240
It'll be me.

602
00:32:43,510 --> 00:32:44,310
What's going on?

603
00:32:44,310 --> 00:32:44,960
See? See?

604
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:46,200
I'm just teasing you.

605
00:32:48,030 --> 00:32:48,640
Seriously,

606
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:49,510
you're an adult now.

607
00:32:49,510 --> 00:32:50,510
Why can't you

608
00:32:50,550 --> 00:32:51,480
act properly?

609
00:32:51,960 --> 00:32:53,090
I can't believe you.

610
00:32:54,550 --> 00:32:55,070
Here.

611
00:32:55,310 --> 00:32:55,970
Be careful.

612
00:32:59,480 --> 00:33:00,270
Tell me,

613
00:33:02,200 --> 00:33:03,720
wouldn't it be better
if you just stay home

614
00:33:03,720 --> 00:33:05,520
and work shifts with your uncle?

615
00:33:05,830 --> 00:33:06,760
Let me see. Here.

616
00:33:07,550 --> 00:33:09,510
How come I didn't see it? Really.

617
00:33:10,270 --> 00:33:11,880
Always reading those books,

618
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:13,750
listening to those radio programsâ€”

619
00:33:13,750 --> 00:33:14,750
what's the point?

620
00:33:14,790 --> 00:33:16,390
Will it get you into college?

621
00:33:16,830 --> 00:33:17,960
Carpentry,

622
00:33:18,160 --> 00:33:19,440
bamboo weaving,

623
00:33:21,030 --> 00:33:22,230
and... and what else?

624
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:24,530
And repairing household appliances?

625
00:33:24,550 --> 00:33:26,550
How many times have you shocked yourself?

626
00:33:26,550 --> 00:33:27,880
You're still laughing?

627
00:33:28,310 --> 00:33:29,550
You'll be shocked to death one day.

628
00:33:29,550 --> 00:33:30,510
Really.

629
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:31,440
Here.

630
00:33:34,270 --> 00:33:34,830
Aunt.

631
00:33:35,920 --> 00:33:36,680
I'm leaving.

632
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:38,570
Where are you going?

633
00:33:38,830 --> 00:33:39,350
Here.

634
00:33:41,310 --> 00:33:42,570
I've found a relative.

635
00:33:44,200 --> 00:33:44,960
A relative?

636
00:33:45,720 --> 00:33:47,580
Since when do you have a relative?

637
00:33:47,830 --> 00:33:48,720
It's been over 10 years.

638
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:50,750
I've never heard of you
having any relatives.

639
00:33:50,750 --> 00:33:52,270
Don't get tricked again.

640
00:33:53,790 --> 00:33:54,400
It's fine.

641
00:33:55,110 --> 00:33:56,350
Whenever I have time,

642
00:33:56,590 --> 00:33:58,320
I'll come back to visit you all.

643
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:06,160
Really?

644
00:34:24,360 --> 00:34:25,159
In the future,

645
00:34:25,320 --> 00:34:26,850
stay in touch if you want to.

646
00:34:27,030 --> 00:34:28,360
If not, forget it.

647
00:34:33,150 --> 00:34:34,360
Whatever.

648
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:49,810
Xiaowei.

649
00:34:51,550 --> 00:34:52,440
Are you never

650
00:34:52,440 --> 00:34:53,500
coming back again?

651
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:07,930
Why are you leaving?

652
00:35:09,030 --> 00:35:09,760
Is it...

653
00:35:10,440 --> 00:35:11,320
because you're not happy

654
00:35:11,320 --> 00:35:12,650
living with our family?

655
00:35:14,550 --> 00:35:15,440
Have you thought about

656
00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:16,110
what will happen to our family

657
00:35:16,110 --> 00:35:17,190
after you leave?

658
00:35:18,550 --> 00:35:19,440
My dad and momâ€”

659
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:21,110
how sad they'll be?

660
00:35:21,840 --> 00:35:23,230
Big Brother listens to everything you say.

661
00:35:23,230 --> 00:35:24,960
What will he do after you leave?

662
00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:26,150
And me.

663
00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:27,630
Who's going to support me

664
00:35:27,630 --> 00:35:28,960
in learning to play the guitar?

665
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:31,020
Who'll be there to listen when I sing?

666
00:35:35,920 --> 00:35:36,710
Xiaoling,

667
00:35:37,630 --> 00:35:38,480
I'm sorry.

668
00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:40,030
It's all my fault.

669
00:35:45,230 --> 00:35:46,760
But whether I'm here or not,

670
00:35:47,880 --> 00:35:49,410
you must keep working hard.

671
00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:50,820
If you have dreams,

672
00:35:51,190 --> 00:35:52,670
you should strive to achieve them.

673
00:35:52,670 --> 00:35:54,030
That's what makes life meaningful.

674
00:35:54,030 --> 00:35:54,590
Right?

675
00:35:55,280 --> 00:35:56,880
I understand all that!

676
00:35:57,710 --> 00:35:58,550
What I don't understand is

677
00:35:58,550 --> 00:36:00,150
why you have to leave us.

678
00:36:06,070 --> 00:36:07,710
It took me 16 years

679
00:36:09,070 --> 00:36:10,670
to finally understand this:

680
00:36:11,030 --> 00:36:12,230
running away only brings

681
00:36:12,230 --> 00:36:13,360
more suffering.

682
00:36:15,760 --> 00:36:17,960
Actually, before I came to this family,

683
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:20,880
I had my own family.

684
00:36:22,150 --> 00:36:23,690
But because I ran away,

685
00:36:23,880 --> 00:36:24,670
they were

686
00:36:24,760 --> 00:36:26,030
deeply hurt.

687
00:36:26,110 --> 00:36:27,160
So now,

688
00:36:27,590 --> 00:36:28,710
I have to face it.

689
00:36:29,590 --> 00:36:31,360
I have to resolve all these problems.

690
00:36:31,360 --> 00:36:32,480
Otherwise,

691
00:36:32,630 --> 00:36:34,440
I don't deserve to be your brother.

692
00:36:34,440 --> 00:36:35,480
And I don't deserve to continue to live

693
00:36:35,480 --> 00:36:36,550
in this world.

694
00:36:36,670 --> 00:36:37,400
He's gone.

695
00:36:37,710 --> 00:36:38,910
Should we follow him?

696
00:36:41,480 --> 00:36:42,810
Let's follow him first.

697
00:36:46,030 --> 00:36:46,960
Although

698
00:36:47,150 --> 00:36:49,350
I don't understand what you're saying,

699
00:36:49,760 --> 00:36:50,880
I can tell

700
00:36:51,510 --> 00:36:53,640
it's something very important to you.

701
00:36:58,150 --> 00:36:59,210
I truly hope you...

702
00:37:00,850 --> 00:37:02,710
you'll never have to understand.

703
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:03,710
Just like the lyrics

704
00:37:03,710 --> 00:37:04,970
of your favorite song:

705
00:37:06,920 --> 00:37:10,190
"May your eyes

706
00:37:11,280 --> 00:37:14,710
only see smiles.

707
00:37:16,070 --> 00:37:20,320
May every tear you shed

708
00:37:20,760 --> 00:37:23,800
move someone's heart."

709
00:37:36,440 --> 00:37:37,320
He went in.

710
00:37:37,590 --> 00:37:38,790
Are you really going?

711
00:37:40,150 --> 00:37:42,000
Are you sure about the house number?

712
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:43,630
I asked the property management.

713
00:37:43,630 --> 00:37:45,440
I gave them 2 cartons of cigarettes, so...

714
00:37:45,440 --> 00:37:46,700
it should be reliable.

715
00:37:51,610 --> 00:37:52,250
Xiaowei,

716
00:37:52,280 --> 00:37:54,760
if... if you just go in
and talk to him like this,

717
00:37:54,760 --> 00:37:55,800
will he even admit it?

718
00:37:55,800 --> 00:37:57,460
Whether he'll admit it or not,

719
00:37:58,030 --> 00:37:58,960
I'll go meet him,

720
00:37:59,320 --> 00:38:00,320
just like he said.

721
00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:21,960
Two rows of buttons.

722
00:38:21,960 --> 00:38:24,250
Left side: B2 to 7.

723
00:38:24,440 --> 00:38:27,390
Right side: 8 to 16.

724
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:29,000
There's Braille.

725
00:38:30,150 --> 00:38:32,400
After you step out of the elevator,
it's on your left.

726
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:33,030
I know.

727
00:38:33,710 --> 00:38:35,170
Maybe I should go with you.

728
00:38:36,030 --> 00:38:36,670
No need.

729
00:38:37,070 --> 00:38:38,270
I can manage on my own.

730
00:38:38,280 --> 00:38:39,280
You go back first.

731
00:38:42,190 --> 00:38:42,710
Okay.

732
00:38:43,070 --> 00:38:43,710
Be careful.

733
00:38:43,710 --> 00:38:44,190
Okay.
