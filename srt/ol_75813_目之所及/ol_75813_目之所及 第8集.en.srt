then nobody will be able to

00:10:15,630 --> 00:10:16,870
get along with you in the future.

177
00:10:16,870 --> 00:10:18,670
Hurry up and get them out of here.

178
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:20,120

179
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:22,120
isn't a place just anyone can enter.

180
00:10:22,510 --> 00:10:23,540
I mean, you, this...

181
00:10:23,540 --> 00:10:24,800
are you really a bit...

182
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:25,910
Zhang Dongliang.

183
00:10:25,910 --> 00:10:26,910
Cut the nonsense.

184
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:32,520
Let me ask you.

185
00:10:33,110 --> 00:10:35,290
[Focus on Medical Quality,
Put Patients First]

186
00:10:33,550 --> 00:10:35,360
How's the vehicle investigation going?

187
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:37,000
There’s been some progress.

188
00:10:37,150 --> 00:10:38,030
You were right.

189
00:10:38,030 --> 00:10:38,960
Zhuo'er Company

190
00:10:39,080 --> 00:10:40,910
does have a black Toyota Camry.

191
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:42,790
But the vehicle requisition records

192
00:10:42,790 --> 00:10:43,920
were tampered with.

193
00:10:44,150 --> 00:10:44,910
The originals

194
00:10:44,910 --> 00:10:46,320
are with the Deputy General Manager of
Zhuo'er Company.

195
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:47,120
Fu Wenjiang.

196
00:10:47,630 --> 00:10:48,360
The next step

197
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:49,480
is to find Fu Wenjiang

198
00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:51,210
and get the originals from him.

199
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:52,720
But he said

200
00:10:52,870 --> 00:10:54,600
he's busy at the factory in Yunzhou.

201
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:56,910
and won't return to Dongjiang
in the next couple of days.

202
00:10:56,910 --> 00:10:57,480
Alright.

203
00:10:57,840 --> 00:10:59,120
Since he's in Yunzhou,

204
00:10:59,510 --> 00:11:00,440
then I'll check these couple of days,

205
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:02,270
where he's been staying in Yunzhou.

206
00:11:02,270 --> 00:11:03,720
You—You listen to me.

207
00:11:03,750 --> 00:11:04,480
That's it.

208
00:11:04,790 --> 00:11:05,270
I—

209
00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:10,390
Next time,

210
00:11:10,390 --> 00:11:11,870
if you hang up on me again…

211
00:11:16,070 --> 00:11:16,790
Mentor!

212
00:11:17,530 --> 00:11:18,580
[Focus on Medical Quality,
Put Patients First]

213
00:11:19,750 --> 00:11:20,440
I just spoke with a nurse

214
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:21,870
and found the head of
the emergency department.

215
00:11:21,870 --> 00:11:22,720
Found out since the 80s,

216
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:23,910
he's been working at this hospital.

217
00:11:23,910 --> 00:11:25,640
Maybe he remembers something.

218
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:26,630
Let's go!

219
00:11:26,630 --> 00:11:27,160
Let's go!

220
00:11:28,790 --> 00:11:30,020
Do you know how many patients

221
00:11:30,020 --> 00:11:31,280
I see every single day?

222
00:11:31,390 --> 00:11:32,790
Our place is by the river.

223
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:33,530
Every year,

224
00:11:33,530 --> 00:11:35,480
many kids who fell in the water
are sent here.

225
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:36,510
Especially back then,

226
00:11:36,510 --> 00:11:37,790
when there wasn't much supervision,

227
00:11:37,790 --> 00:11:39,030
many people went to play in the river,

228
00:11:39,030 --> 00:11:40,490
even for winter swimming.

229
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:42,690
How could I possibly remember?

230
00:11:48,510 --> 00:11:49,510
He had a special trait.

231
00:11:49,510 --> 00:11:50,320
He was blind.

232
00:11:50,870 --> 00:11:52,240
Before he fell into the water,

233
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:53,370
he had a head injury,

234
00:11:53,390 --> 00:11:55,050
causing him to lose his sight.

235
00:11:57,750 --> 00:11:59,080
There's no such person.

236
00:12:01,750 --> 00:12:03,410
You must remember something.

237
00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:04,720
What is it?

238
00:12:06,910 --> 00:12:08,000
What I remembered

239
00:12:08,030 --> 00:12:09,830
has nothing to do with your case.

240
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:11,920
It's fine.

241
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:13,120
Just tell us.

242
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:17,800
You said a head injury

243
00:12:17,840 --> 00:12:19,320
caused blindness.

244
00:12:20,870 --> 00:12:22,270
That reminded me of a kid.

245
00:12:22,510 --> 00:12:24,510
The year I had just started working,

246
00:12:25,510 --> 00:12:26,440
also 1986,

247
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:27,270
that summer.

248
00:12:28,550 --> 00:12:29,870
What happened? Who brought him in?

249
00:12:29,870 --> 00:12:30,630
Where's his family?

250
00:12:30,630 --> 00:12:31,240
I don't know.

251
00:12:31,240 --> 00:12:32,430
When we found him,
he was already at the hospital entrance.

252
00:12:32,430 --> 00:12:33,030
Young man!

253
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:34,000
Young man!

254
00:12:34,510 --> 00:12:35,080
Young man!

255
00:12:35,080 --> 00:12:36,540
Can you hear me? Young man!

256
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:37,270
Young man!

257
00:12:37,910 --> 00:12:38,970
Wake up, young man!

258
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:47,850
But it had nothing to do with drowning.

259
00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:50,630
About this blind kid,

260
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,530
what else can you remember?

261
00:12:52,910 --> 00:12:53,600
Tell us.

262
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:57,080
I remember...

263
00:12:57,120 --> 00:12:59,000
his name was entered incorrectly.

264
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,150
When he was admitted,

265
00:13:00,150 --> 00:13:01,280
he was unconscious.

266
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:02,480
The nurse found a student ID

267
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:03,690
on him.

268
00:13:03,870 --> 00:13:04,750
with a photo.

269
00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:07,280
So they registered him under that name.

270
00:13:07,390 --> 00:13:08,630
After his mother arrived,

271
00:13:08,630 --> 00:13:10,550
at first she didn’t say it was wrong.

272
00:13:10,550 --> 00:13:11,320
Later,

273
00:13:11,480 --> 00:13:12,390
after some days,

274
00:13:12,390 --> 00:13:13,550
when he was about to be discharged,

275
00:13:13,550 --> 00:13:14,720
his mother came to me specially

276
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:16,070
and said the name was registered wrong.

277
00:13:16,070 --> 00:13:17,530
She insisted I correct it.

278
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:19,950
The two kids were twins.

279
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:21,870
The injured one was the older brother.

280
00:13:21,870 --> 00:13:22,720
But he carried

281
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:24,650
his younger brother's student ID.

282
00:13:24,790 --> 00:13:25,600
I remember

283
00:13:25,910 --> 00:13:27,640
he was a very upright young man.

284
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:28,870
What a pity.

285
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:30,510
It's impossible, doctor.

286
00:13:30,510 --> 00:13:31,150
Impossible.

287
00:13:31,150 --> 00:13:32,510
You must have made a mistake!

288
00:13:32,510 --> 00:13:33,910
He—he couldn't have gone blind.

289
00:13:33,910 --> 00:13:34,650
If he's blind,

290
00:13:34,650 --> 00:13:35,440
what will happen to his future?

291
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:36,320
I'm begging you,

292
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:37,270
I beg you to save him.

293
00:13:37,270 --> 00:13:37,840
please?

294
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:38,440
I'll kneel for you!

295
00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:38,840
I'll kowtow to you!

296
00:13:38,840 --> 00:13:40,000
Family member. Family member.

297
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:40,730
Listen to me.

298
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:43,270
His optic nerve is damaged,

299
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:44,510
but he can still distinguish

300
00:13:44,510 --> 00:13:45,610
some light and shadows.

301
00:13:45,610 --> 00:13:46,600
He's not completely blind.

302
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:47,360
The two kids—

303
00:13:47,490 --> 00:13:49,390
I still remember their names somewhat.

304
00:13:49,390 --> 00:13:50,390
What's their names?

305
00:13:50,390 --> 00:13:51,520
Something "Xin"...

306
00:13:51,630 --> 00:13:52,760
Something "Fan"...

307
00:14:21,790 --> 00:14:22,520
Fu Wenjiang.

308
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:31,740
[One person's carelessness creates chaos;

309
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:36,170
Fu Wenjiang.

310
00:14:52,080 --> 00:14:52,720
Ms. Qu.

311
00:14:53,720 --> 00:14:54,450
You’re here.

312
00:14:59,030 --> 00:15:00,290
Where is the evidence?

313
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:11,030
Well.

314
00:15:12,550 --> 00:15:13,840
There's no rush.

315
00:15:14,870 --> 00:15:15,440
Let me see

316
00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:17,080
whether the money in your bag

317
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:18,870
is real?

318
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:36,550
How about

319
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:39,270
you throw the bag

320
00:15:39,290 --> 00:15:39,790
over?

321
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:41,670
Oh?

322
00:15:43,510 --> 00:15:44,640
Are you afraid of me?

323
00:15:46,510 --> 00:15:47,120
Yes.

324
00:15:47,840 --> 00:15:48,510
Ms. Qu,

325
00:15:48,870 --> 00:15:50,840
I’m a little scared.

326
00:15:51,790 --> 00:15:53,080
You put your hand

327
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:54,550
in that pocket.

328
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:55,670
What's inside?

329
00:16:03,030 --> 00:16:03,760
Fu Wenjiang.

330
00:16:04,670 --> 00:16:06,080
I'm here alone today

331
00:16:08,360 --> 00:16:09,690
because I'm desperate.

332
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:15,000
Look.

333
00:16:17,320 --> 00:16:18,750
I've dialled 110.

334
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:20,630
If you lie to me,

335
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:23,300
or refuse to give me the evidence,

336
00:16:24,490 --> 00:16:25,550
I'll call the cops.

337
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:30,120
You want to call the cops?

338
00:16:33,270 --> 00:16:33,840
Go ahead.

339
00:16:35,750 --> 00:16:36,910
Don't forget

340
00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:40,390
you're a murderer.

341
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:43,150
Right?

342
00:16:47,790 --> 00:16:48,720
Try me.

343
00:16:52,360 --> 00:16:53,080
Ms. Qu.

344
00:16:54,150 --> 00:16:56,150
Why did you say that?

345
00:16:58,790 --> 00:16:59,670
In fact,

346
00:17:01,080 --> 00:17:02,880
I don't want to pretend anymore.

347
00:17:05,790 --> 00:17:07,069
You think

348
00:17:08,960 --> 00:17:10,819
I'm happy to talk to you like this?

349
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:15,130
Su Muxin and I

350
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:16,680
are college classmates.

351
00:17:17,829 --> 00:17:19,030
You know that, right?

352
00:17:20,790 --> 00:17:22,030
Back in the college,

353
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:24,119
I worked harder than him.

354
00:17:24,680 --> 00:17:26,280
I got better grades than him.

355
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:29,110
Why after graduation

356
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:30,880
did I become your family's

357
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:32,000
errand boy?

358
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:35,130
Why am I incharge of

359
00:17:35,160 --> 00:17:37,220
every hard, dirty, exhausting task?

360
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:40,520
You treated me like

361
00:17:40,550 --> 00:17:42,400
your family dog!

362
00:17:44,920 --> 00:17:45,720
Fu Wenjiang,

363
00:17:47,270 --> 00:17:48,800
I never ordered you around.

364
00:17:55,030 --> 00:17:57,400
You never ordered me?

365
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,350
Like family, like treatment!

366
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:03,310
Your whole family's the same!

367
00:18:04,680 --> 00:18:06,280
Don't think I don't know that

368
00:18:06,680 --> 00:18:08,550
your husband beated you at home.

369
00:18:10,590 --> 00:18:11,070
Oh, yes.

370
00:18:11,240 --> 00:18:13,000
He even sent you to a mental hospital

371
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,200
where they electrocuted you everyday.

372
00:18:17,510 --> 00:18:18,590
Now you've

373
00:18:19,110 --> 00:18:19,790
finally killed

374
00:18:19,790 --> 00:18:21,160
Su Muxin.

375
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:23,500
The company,

376
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:24,920
the money,

377
00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:27,200
all yours!

378
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:31,960
So

379
00:18:33,270 --> 00:18:35,000
you and I

380
00:18:35,790 --> 00:18:36,920
are the same:

381
00:18:37,550 --> 00:18:39,110
both for money!

382
00:18:45,030 --> 00:18:46,030
Give me the phone!

383
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:46,920
Give it to me!

384
00:18:46,920 --> 00:18:47,550
You...

385
00:18:51,350 --> 00:18:52,350
You're not dead?!

386
00:18:56,270 --> 00:18:56,960
Qu Tong!

387
00:19:00,030 --> 00:19:00,560
Qu Tong!

388
00:19:43,110 --> 00:19:44,510
Hello? Can you hear me?

389
00:19:45,070 --> 00:19:45,590
Hello?

390
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:46,790
Hello?

391
00:19:47,350 --> 00:19:48,880
This is Command Center 110.

392
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:06,510
I told you

393
00:20:07,750 --> 00:20:08,750
stay away from me.

394
00:20:09,430 --> 00:20:10,960
Don't get involved in this.

395
00:20:11,480 --> 00:20:12,740
Don't you understand?

396
00:20:19,350 --> 00:20:20,880
Fu Wenjiang moved the body.

397
00:20:21,660 --> 00:20:23,590
Material evidence is in his hands.

398
00:20:24,350 --> 00:20:25,790
Don't you get it?

399
00:20:33,830 --> 00:20:34,920
I just want to help.

400
00:20:35,590 --> 00:20:36,310
Why?

401
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:40,310
I mean no harm.

402
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:41,920
I know you meant well.

403
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:46,590
But I want to know

404
00:20:49,350 --> 00:20:50,030
why?

405
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:57,860
Or let me put it this way...

406
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:36,770
[Muxin]

407
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:50,550
Who are you really?

408
00:21:58,950 --> 00:22:02,630
[1986]

409
00:22:10,790 --> 00:22:11,400
Here.

410
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:13,510
Eat more!

411
00:22:15,420 --> 00:22:17,280
Good nutrition speeds recovery.

412
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:33,160
And you.

413
00:22:33,880 --> 00:22:34,920
Study hard!

414
00:22:35,510 --> 00:22:36,660
College is starting soo.

415
00:22:36,660 --> 00:22:37,590
Don't fall behind!

416
00:22:37,590 --> 00:22:38,240
Hear me?

417
00:23:09,110 --> 00:23:10,310
It's all Mom's fault.

418
00:23:12,250 --> 00:23:13,260
I failed you.

419
00:23:15,950 --> 00:23:17,810
There was no other way.

420
00:23:18,920 --> 00:23:20,530
Only your brother going to college

421
00:23:20,530 --> 00:23:21,980
gives our family hope

422
00:23:22,440 --> 00:23:24,160
to treat your eyes!

423
00:23:25,750 --> 00:23:27,690
I know you're unhappy.

424
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:30,000
Hit me if you want!

425
00:23:30,510 --> 00:23:31,000
You...

426
00:23:38,160 --> 00:23:39,240
Don't worry.

427
00:23:40,790 --> 00:23:41,750
I will do nothing

428
00:23:41,750 --> 00:23:43,200
but to care for you

429
00:23:43,960 --> 00:23:44,750
my whole life.

430
00:23:44,750 --> 00:23:46,350
You'll be fine under my care.

431
00:23:46,350 --> 00:23:47,030
Okay?

432
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:50,750
And...

433
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:51,880
your brother too!

434
00:23:52,160 --> 00:23:52,790
Come here!

435
00:23:53,160 --> 00:23:53,560
Quick!

436
00:23:54,850 --> 00:23:55,780
Come here, fast!

437
00:24:02,070 --> 00:24:03,600
You two brothers

438
00:24:03,790 --> 00:24:04,830
are the bonded by blood

439
00:24:04,830 --> 00:24:06,110
in this world!

440
00:24:08,160 --> 00:24:08,750
We...

441
00:24:09,270 --> 00:24:10,640
We unite as one.

442
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:11,350
Okay?

443
00:24:13,270 --> 00:24:14,000
Okay?

444
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:33,660
My child...

445
00:24:36,030 --> 00:24:37,730
Tell Mom again

446
00:24:40,530 --> 00:24:41,350
who are you?

447
00:24:53,860 --> 00:24:55,040
I'm Su Muxin.

448
00:25:04,440 --> 00:25:05,160
Mentor,

449
00:25:06,300 --> 00:25:07,400
so it seems

450
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:08,720
the one who attended college

451
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:09,980
was actually Su Mufan.

452
00:25:10,190 --> 00:25:11,650
The blind one was Su Muxin.

453
00:25:11,970 --> 00:25:13,300
Now we need to find

454
00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:14,410
Su Muxin.

455
00:25:14,750 --> 00:25:16,870
The suspect in Shi Yue's case

456
00:25:16,890 --> 00:25:18,060
is also Su Muxin.

457
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:20,050
Aren't we back to square one?

458
00:25:20,050 --> 00:25:21,000
We were looking for

459
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:22,080
Su Muxin all along!

460
00:25:22,190 --> 00:25:23,270
No matter who he is.

461
00:25:23,880 --> 00:25:25,740
It won't affect the current case.

462
00:25:25,880 --> 00:25:27,410
We still need to arrest him.

463
00:25:27,550 --> 00:25:28,510
In 1986,

464
00:25:28,530 --> 00:25:30,690
they switched identities.

465
00:25:30,920 --> 00:25:31,720
Well.

466
00:25:32,470 --> 00:25:33,520
After all,

467
00:25:33,790 --> 00:25:35,000
his true identity

468
00:25:35,310 --> 00:25:36,840
only matters to one person.

469
00:25:38,320 --> 00:25:39,040
Qu Tong.

470
00:25:42,270 --> 00:25:43,000
Your...

471
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:46,270
your eyes.

472
00:25:52,120 --> 00:25:53,730
How did you lose sight?

473
00:25:57,990 --> 00:25:58,820
That day,

474
00:26:00,350 --> 00:26:01,960
I went to meet you as planned.

475
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:16,860
Passing a residential building,

476
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:20,300
I heard a scream from the roof.

477
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:22,030
Looking up,

478
00:26:23,830 --> 00:26:24,830
I was struck

479
00:26:26,490 --> 00:26:28,000
Then I passed out.

480
00:26:45,130 --> 00:26:46,230
I thought

481
00:26:47,830 --> 00:26:49,000
I'd never

482
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:49,790
learn why.

483
00:26:54,070 --> 00:26:55,110
Until that day,

484
00:26:56,070 --> 00:26:57,870
I asking about wine at Shi Yue's.

485
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:33,720
Honey,

486
00:27:33,920 --> 00:27:35,200
I was freaked out!

487
00:27:35,310 --> 00:27:36,680
Cockroaches again!

488
00:27:37,720 --> 00:27:38,920
Are you from Yunzhou?

489
00:27:45,090 --> 00:27:45,720
Honey...

490
00:27:45,750 --> 00:27:47,080
Why did you suddenly...

491
00:27:54,200 --> 00:27:54,960
1986.

492
00:27:55,980 --> 00:27:57,250
July 28.

493
00:27:57,680 --> 00:27:59,480
It was raining heavily that day.

494
00:28:00,030 --> 00:28:03,200
The residential building near
Yunzhou No. 1 High School.

495
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:04,680
Was that you?

496
00:28:20,190 --> 00:28:21,120
Who are you?

497
00:28:27,790 --> 00:28:28,790
And who are you?

498
00:28:37,480 --> 00:28:38,460
Don't come over!

499
00:28:39,090 --> 00:28:40,250
Don't come over!

500
00:29:12,400 --> 00:29:13,070
Shi Yue!

501
00:29:14,590 --> 00:29:15,750
Do you have asthma?

502
00:29:19,240 --> 00:29:19,840
Medicine!

503
00:29:21,270 --> 00:29:21,870
Medicine!

504
00:29:28,190 --> 00:29:29,450
Where is the medicine?

505
00:29:29,840 --> 00:29:31,790
Shi Yue, where is your medicine?

506
00:29:48,510 --> 00:29:49,200
Shi Yue!

507
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:51,160
Shi Yue!

508
00:29:52,160 --> 00:29:52,960
Shi Yue!

509
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:22,330
I couldn't save her.

510
00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:24,310
So I can't

511
00:30:24,350 --> 00:30:25,160
prove

512
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:25,960
what happened

513
00:30:25,960 --> 00:30:27,240
in 1986?

514
00:30:28,160 --> 00:30:28,920
Maybe

515
00:30:29,550 --> 00:30:30,640
I made a mistake.

516
00:30:33,880 --> 00:30:35,340
Maybe it wasn't her at all.

517
00:30:38,310 --> 00:30:39,480
It was her.

518
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:46,350
Hao Meili

519
00:30:48,310 --> 00:30:49,460
is Shi Yue.

520
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:51,750
The one she tried to hit

521
00:31:04,510 --> 00:31:05,920
was me.

522
00:31:16,220 --> 00:31:17,700
I'm sorry.

523
00:31:18,440 --> 00:31:19,590
I'm sorry.

524
00:31:21,810 --> 00:31:24,190
If I hadn't given you that umbrella,

525
00:31:27,240 --> 00:31:29,040
none of this would've happened.

526
00:31:32,840 --> 00:31:33,780
I'm sorry.

527
00:31:38,270 --> 00:31:39,070
Qu Tong.

528
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:39,920
Qu Tong.

529
00:31:39,920 --> 00:31:40,640
I'm sorry.

530
00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:47,900
Don't think like that.

531
00:31:49,270 --> 00:31:50,870
It has nothing to do with you.

532
00:31:53,920 --> 00:31:54,980
It doesn't matter.

533
00:31:55,440 --> 00:31:57,680
But you're blind now.

534
00:31:59,180 --> 00:32:00,580
It's all in the past.

535
00:32:12,160 --> 00:32:14,290
They've been married for seven years.

536
00:32:14,550 --> 00:32:15,490
They had a child,

537
00:32:15,510 --> 00:32:17,570
but later lost the kid to an accident.

538
00:32:17,750 --> 00:32:19,550
They've lived together for so long

539
00:32:19,550 --> 00:32:21,350
and experienced so many things.

540
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:24,070
Qu Tong must have felt

541
00:32:24,070 --> 00:32:25,130
something was off.

542
00:32:25,830 --> 00:32:27,400
The husband she thinks she knows so well

543
00:32:27,400 --> 00:32:28,400
has actually always been

544
00:32:28,400 --> 00:32:29,640
another person.

545
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:32,790
His identity and his appearance

546
00:32:32,790 --> 00:32:33,510
match.

547
00:32:34,790 --> 00:32:36,390
But what about the emotions?

548
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:38,780
What about the details of daily life?

549
00:32:39,920 --> 00:32:42,780
There must be signs of something wrong
everywhere.

550
00:32:44,160 --> 00:32:46,220
If it were me, I would have gone crazy.

551
00:32:50,920 --> 00:32:51,920
What would I do?

552
00:32:54,070 --> 00:32:55,270
I would doubt myself.

553
00:32:55,680 --> 00:32:56,200
I would think

554
00:32:56,200 --> 00:32:57,530
the whole world is fake.

555
00:32:58,350 --> 00:32:59,400
I would think

556
00:33:01,240 --> 00:33:02,130
the husband in front of me

557
00:33:02,130 --> 00:33:03,330
is totally different

558
00:33:03,720 --> 00:33:05,200
from the lover in my heart.

559
00:33:06,400 --> 00:33:07,200
Cheating.

560
00:33:07,920 --> 00:33:08,790
Domestic violence.

561
00:33:08,790 --> 00:33:09,590
Controlling.

562
00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:12,840
He's nothing but a devil.

563
00:33:16,230 --> 00:33:17,130
But this devil

564
00:33:17,160 --> 00:33:19,560
wears the face of the person
I love the most.

565
00:33:21,550 --> 00:33:23,070
What should I do?

566
00:33:24,440 --> 00:33:25,400
I would...

567
00:33:26,200 --> 00:33:27,530
I would try my best to get back

568
00:33:27,530 --> 00:33:28,730
the lover in my heart.

569
00:33:31,110 --> 00:33:32,310
But the harder I try,

570
00:33:33,160 --> 00:33:34,690
the farther he gets from me.

571
00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:36,350
Later on,

572
00:33:38,240 --> 00:33:39,480
every look he gives,

573
00:33:41,400 --> 00:33:42,480
every word he says,

574
00:33:43,720 --> 00:33:44,980
and every thing he does

575
00:33:45,310 --> 00:33:46,970
would make me feel terrified,

576
00:33:48,200 --> 00:33:49,060
and desperate.

577
00:33:53,510 --> 00:33:54,590
What would I do?

578
00:33:56,960 --> 00:33:57,880
I would...

579
00:34:00,200 --> 00:34:01,400
What would I do?

580
00:34:20,110 --> 00:34:21,030
I would end everything

581
00:34:21,030 --> 00:34:22,190
with death.

582
00:34:28,190 --> 00:34:28,960
Mentor.

583
00:34:30,150 --> 00:34:31,230
If that's the case,

584
00:34:31,760 --> 00:34:34,280
Qu Tong has a motive
to kill her husband Su Muxin,

585
00:34:34,280 --> 00:34:36,400
who is actually Su Mufan.

586
00:34:38,710 --> 00:34:40,310
I wonder how Su Mufan managed

587
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:41,630
to deceive Qu Tong

588
00:34:41,630 --> 00:34:42,960
when they met back then.

589
00:35:11,670 --> 00:35:16,680
[1994]

590
00:35:21,670 --> 00:35:22,590
Are you waiting for me?

591
00:35:22,590 --> 00:35:23,960
From now on, if you're past dinner time,

592
00:35:23,960 --> 00:35:25,420
don't come back for meals.

593
00:35:25,840 --> 00:35:26,900
Go wash your hands.

594
00:35:38,550 --> 00:35:39,000
I...

595
00:35:39,280 --> 00:35:41,000
I didn't come back late on purpose.

596
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:42,260
There's a little issue

597
00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:44,680
with the Industry and Commerce Bureau.

598
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:45,600
What's wrong?

599
00:35:46,110 --> 00:35:47,320
Our application

600
00:35:47,360 --> 00:35:48,560
didn't get approved.

601
00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:50,680
I think it's quite troublesome.

602
00:35:50,790 --> 00:35:52,450
I went to ask someone for help.

603
00:35:52,630 --> 00:35:53,590
Otherwise,

604
00:35:55,550 --> 00:35:56,880
we might be suspended

605
00:35:58,480 --> 00:35:59,820
and we might even have to compensate

606
00:35:59,820 --> 00:36:00,940
for the losses.

607
00:36:02,440 --> 00:36:03,000
This...

608
00:36:05,320 --> 00:36:05,960
This...

609
00:36:09,320 --> 00:36:10,110
Let's eat.

610
00:36:14,710 --> 00:36:15,320
By the way,

611
00:36:15,800 --> 00:36:17,480
make some time on Saturday.

612
00:36:18,110 --> 00:36:19,030
Mrs. Chen

613
00:36:19,280 --> 00:36:21,480
is going to introduce a young man to you.

614
00:36:21,960 --> 00:36:23,360
I've already checked him out.

615
00:36:23,360 --> 00:36:25,160
His conditions are pretty good.

616
00:36:25,800 --> 00:36:27,360
He's a good match for you.

617
00:36:30,550 --> 00:36:31,070
Mom.

618
00:36:31,330 --> 00:36:32,590
I can't go on Saturday.

619
00:36:33,510 --> 00:36:34,440
I have work to do.

620
00:36:41,840 --> 00:36:42,710
Don't think

621
00:36:43,710 --> 00:36:45,640
I don't know what you're thinking.

622
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:47,840
If you had listened to me,

623
00:36:48,070 --> 00:36:48,710
now,

624
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:49,960
would you be stuck

625
00:36:49,960 --> 00:36:51,550
working as some temporary teacher

626
00:36:51,550 --> 00:36:53,080
at that ridiculous school?

627
00:36:53,550 --> 00:36:54,630
Study meteorology

628
00:36:56,630 --> 00:36:58,800
to become a wild man in the mountains?

629
00:37:01,510 --> 00:37:02,550
For a girl,

630
00:37:03,230 --> 00:37:05,030
there are two big things in life.

631
00:37:05,800 --> 00:37:07,230
The first one, college,

632
00:37:07,480 --> 00:37:08,880
was already ruined by you.

633
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:10,480
As for the second, marriage,

634
00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:11,810
you have to listen to me.

635
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:13,070
On this matter,

636
00:37:13,480 --> 00:37:15,280
there's no room for discussion.

637
00:37:21,070 --> 00:37:22,400
I'll make it clear then.

638
00:37:23,550 --> 00:37:24,960
I won't go on a blind date.

639
00:37:27,840 --> 00:37:28,880
No blind date?

640
00:37:29,590 --> 00:37:30,720
What's your reason?

641
00:37:32,230 --> 00:37:33,150
Tell me.

642
00:37:35,440 --> 00:37:36,640
I've had a boyfriend.

643
00:37:40,630 --> 00:37:41,150
Tong.

644
00:37:42,070 --> 00:37:43,270
When did that happen?

645
00:37:43,800 --> 00:37:45,230
You didn't tell me that.

646
00:37:47,190 --> 00:37:47,880
Who is he?

647
00:37:48,230 --> 00:37:49,440
What's his name?

648
00:37:49,760 --> 00:37:51,000
Which university does he graduate from?

649
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:51,860
What does he do?

650
00:37:51,960 --> 00:37:53,290
What does his family do?

651
00:37:55,230 --> 00:37:56,360
His name is Su Muxin.

652
00:38:00,320 --> 00:38:00,780
Then...

653
00:38:04,280 --> 00:38:05,590
Which Su Muxin?

654
00:38:06,230 --> 00:38:06,760
Shen Jing.

655
00:38:06,760 --> 00:38:08,840
This name sounds familiar.

656
00:38:08,840 --> 00:38:09,300
Enough.

657
00:38:09,460 --> 00:38:10,460
Stop pretending.

658
00:38:14,150 --> 00:38:16,080
That's her high school classmate.

659
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:18,710
I remember now.

660
00:38:19,280 --> 00:38:20,510
Tong, is he that old classmate

661
00:38:20,510 --> 00:38:22,080
you met when you went

662
00:38:22,360 --> 00:38:24,550
to the Industry and Commerce Bureau
with me?

663
00:38:24,550 --> 00:38:26,320
You fell in love so soon.

664
00:38:26,800 --> 00:38:28,000
I didn't expect that.

665
00:38:31,960 --> 00:38:33,290
But this is a good thing.

666
00:38:33,430 --> 00:38:34,440
That young man

667
00:38:34,470 --> 00:38:35,360
is quite nice.

668
00:38:36,030 --> 00:38:37,230
He's a civil servant.

669
00:38:37,250 --> 00:38:39,110
He's even a deputy section chief.

670
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:47,330
Even a section chief
wouldn't be good enough.

671
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:08,440
Muxin.

672
00:39:08,520 --> 00:39:09,360
Do you remember

673
00:39:09,360 --> 00:39:11,230
back when we were filling out
college applications,

674
00:39:11,230 --> 00:39:12,110
we planned

675
00:39:12,110 --> 00:39:13,480
to become wild men together?

676
00:39:13,480 --> 00:39:14,150
Of course.

677
00:39:14,230 --> 00:39:15,310
How could I forget?

678
00:39:17,400 --> 00:39:18,660
Back then, you said...

679
00:39:18,670 --> 00:39:19,930
Look at my poor memory.

680
00:39:21,800 --> 00:39:22,930
I brought it with me,

681
00:39:23,110 --> 00:39:24,770
but I just couldn't remember.

682
00:39:32,030 --> 00:39:32,550
Here.

683
00:39:33,230 --> 00:39:34,490
I found one over there.

684
00:39:39,440 --> 00:39:41,100
I don't like black umbrellas.

685
00:39:45,710 --> 00:39:46,640
Look over there.

686
00:39:47,110 --> 00:39:48,000
So beautiful.

687
00:39:48,710 --> 00:39:49,710
Is it cloud or fog?

688
00:39:56,920 --> 00:39:57,550
Tong.

689
00:40:02,840 --> 00:40:03,970
What's wrong, Tong?

690
00:40:06,030 --> 00:40:06,590
Nothing.

691
00:40:06,960 --> 00:40:08,290
It's too hot down there.

692
00:40:10,150 --> 00:40:10,880

693
00:40:18,070 --> 00:40:20,120
[Qu Tong, Muxin]

694
00:40:18,320 --> 00:40:19,590
Don't you dare lose this ring.

695
00:40:19,590 --> 00:40:20,320
Not for a lifetime!

696
00:40:20,320 --> 00:40:22,120
Whoever loses it is a total dork.

Thumb promise!

Thumb promise!

00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:31,600
What's wrong?

700
00:40:59,320 --> 00:40:59,840
Dad.

701
00:41:00,280 --> 00:41:01,920
I really don't want to get married.

702
00:41:01,920 --> 00:41:02,900
It's already this late.

703
00:41:02,900 --> 00:41:04,450
What on earth is going on?

704
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:06,550
Explain to me, okay?

705
00:41:07,110 --> 00:41:07,960
I think he's different

706
00:41:07,960 --> 00:41:08,760
from before.

707
00:41:11,480 --> 00:41:13,280
He's not the Su Muxin he once was.

708
00:41:18,480 --> 00:41:18,920
Alright.

709
00:41:18,920 --> 00:41:19,760
Now, if we may,

710
00:41:19,800 --> 00:41:20,630
let the two newlyweds

711
00:41:20,630 --> 00:41:22,360
exchange their token of love.

712
00:41:29,320 --> 00:41:30,550
This tiny ring

713
00:41:30,590 --> 00:41:31,480
doesn't just glimmer

714
00:41:31,480 --> 00:41:32,810
with the sheen of metal.

715
00:41:32,840 --> 00:41:33,590
It's more a symbol

716
00:41:33,590 --> 00:41:35,130
of their love.

717
00:41:36,360 --> 00:41:37,920
People change.

718
00:41:38,360 --> 00:41:39,280
In this world,

719
00:41:39,320 --> 00:41:40,190
the only constant

720
00:41:40,190 --> 00:41:41,480
is that everything is changing.

721
00:41:41,480 --> 00:41:42,410
Isn't that true?

722
00:41:42,550 --> 00:41:43,400
Next, let's invite the bride

723
00:41:43,400 --> 00:41:45,000
to place her token of love

724
00:41:45,030 --> 00:41:46,920
on the groom's finger.

725
00:42:06,190 --> 00:42:07,450
He used his position

726
00:42:07,630 --> 00:42:09,160
to save our family factory.

727
00:42:09,920 --> 00:42:10,880
He has the ability

728
00:42:10,880 --> 00:42:12,480
to make your life better.

729
00:42:13,070 --> 00:42:14,470
Shouldn't you marry him?

730
00:42:25,800 --> 00:42:26,400
Tong.

731
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:28,030
You're the one

732
00:42:28,550 --> 00:42:30,810
who wanted to date him in the first place.

733
00:42:31,440 --> 00:42:32,540
I think

734
00:42:32,920 --> 00:42:34,590
this is also your best choice.

735
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:37,860
You'll have a better life than me.

736
00:42:41,710 --> 00:42:43,390
Don't let me down completely.

737
00:42:58,070 --> 00:42:58,960
Alright. As we can see,

738
00:42:58,960 --> 00:42:59,840
our bride is already

739
00:42:59,840 --> 00:43:01,190
moved to tears.

740
00:43:01,230 --> 00:43:03,580
She needs even more of your applause!

741
00:43:08,880 --> 00:43:10,280
This token of love

742
00:43:10,320 --> 00:43:10,920
will also

743
00:43:10,960 --> 00:43:12,480
accompany them
throughout their entire lives,

744
00:43:12,480 --> 00:43:13,880
witnessing every moment

745
00:43:13,920 --> 00:43:15,190
of happiness.

746
00:43:16,030 --> 00:43:17,150
Perfect! The ceremony is now complete.

747
00:43:17,150 --> 00:43:18,280
On this happy

748
00:43:18,320 --> 00:43:19,320
and joyful day,

749
00:43:19,360 --> 00:43:20,690
we all witness together

750
00:43:20,710 --> 00:43:23,440
the birth of a beautiful love.

751
00:43:33,740 --> 00:43:40,890
[Happiness]

752
00:43:41,590 --> 00:43:42,150
Tong.

753
00:43:43,480 --> 00:43:44,610
Where are you going?

754
00:43:46,880 --> 00:43:47,880
To buy something.

755
00:43:51,950 --> 00:43:53,040
I'll go with you.

756
00:43:53,230 --> 00:43:54,960
I can help you carry things too.

757
00:43:55,030 --> 00:43:56,110
Anyway, I don't have much

758
00:43:56,110 --> 00:43:57,040
to do these days.

759
00:43:58,320 --> 00:43:59,030
No need.

760
00:44:00,960 --> 00:44:02,050
I can go by myself.

761
00:44:04,550 --> 00:44:05,560
Did I do something

762
00:44:05,590 --> 00:44:06,200
wrong

763
00:44:06,230 --> 00:44:07,490
that made you unhappy?

764
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:09,630
Tell me.

765
00:44:10,400 --> 00:44:11,190
I can fix it.

766
00:44:22,020 --> 00:44:23,150
I'm not blaming you.

767
00:44:25,070 --> 00:44:26,310
And I'm not unhappy.

768
00:44:28,960 --> 00:44:30,960
I just want to go out for a walk alone.

769
00:44:35,840 --> 00:44:36,480
Fine.

770
00:44:39,530 --> 00:44:40,670
Wait a minute.

771
00:44:51,070 --> 00:44:52,280
The sun is strong outside.

772
00:44:52,280 --> 00:44:53,110
Don't get sunburnt.

773
00:44:53,110 --> 00:44:54,710
Take this umbrella with you.

774
00:44:59,580 --> 00:45:00,360
It's going to rain soon.

775
00:45:00,360 --> 00:45:01,420
Take this with you.

776
00:45:16,120 --> 00:45:17,040
A few days ago,

777
00:45:17,330 --> 00:45:19,550
I checked out
of the single staff dormitory.

778
00:45:19,550 --> 00:45:20,670
And I found this.

779
00:45:30,510 --> 00:45:31,910
I'll wait for you at home.

780
00:45:39,400 --> 00:45:40,450
Wait.
