Judging from the time Su Muxin

527
00:32:15,270 --> 00:32:16,890
was witnessed,

528
00:32:17,160 --> 00:32:18,000
with Yunzhou floating corpse.

529
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:19,000
It doesn’t match.

530
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:20,160
Then we can be sure that...

531
00:32:20,160 --> 00:32:20,790
Yunzhou floating corpse,

532
00:32:20,790 --> 00:32:22,160
is not Su Muxin.

533
00:32:22,440 --> 00:32:23,160
Besides,

534
00:32:23,350 --> 00:32:25,160
Let's talk about the next step.

535
00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:27,720
Stop dragging.

536
00:32:31,070 --> 00:32:31,680
Next!

537
00:32:31,960 --> 00:32:32,550
I think

538
00:32:33,240 --> 00:32:34,790
we should follow

539
00:32:35,070 --> 00:32:35,680
Su Muxin,

540
00:32:35,880 --> 00:32:37,270
the clue of the murder is on the run.

541
00:32:37,270 --> 00:32:38,160
Keep investigating.

542
00:32:38,160 --> 00:32:38,640
Okay.

543
00:32:39,550 --> 00:32:41,370
Continue to search Su Muxin.

544
00:32:41,640 --> 00:32:42,830
I'll follow my plan.

545
00:32:43,600 --> 00:32:45,000
As long as there is a little possibility,

546
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:46,170
I won't give up.

547
00:33:09,240 --> 00:33:10,510
If on the 17th

548
00:33:10,550 --> 00:33:11,720
Su Muxin was dead.

549
00:33:11,750 --> 00:33:12,720
Then on the 18th Qu Tong

550
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:13,720
was meeting with whom?

551
00:33:13,720 --> 00:33:14,480
She went through so much trouble

552
00:33:14,480 --> 00:33:15,310
to circle us around.

553
00:33:15,310 --> 00:33:16,370
What does she want?

554
00:33:17,750 --> 00:33:18,680
I think...

555
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:20,260
I think this corpse

556
00:33:20,350 --> 00:33:21,160
is not Su Muxin.

557
00:33:21,160 --> 00:33:22,400
This basic physical characteristics

558
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:23,830
is quite similar to the Su Muxin

559
00:33:23,830 --> 00:33:24,750
that you're looking for.

560
00:33:24,750 --> 00:33:26,680
The time of death has been speculated

561
00:33:26,560 --> 00:33:29,790
[Autopsy opinion]

562
00:33:26,830 --> 00:33:28,160
on the night of July 15

563
00:33:28,200 --> 00:33:29,880
between 18:00 to 24:00,

564
00:33:30,130 --> 00:33:31,310
Then we can fully determine,

565
00:33:31,310 --> 00:33:33,310
that the floating corpse in Yunzhou is not Su Muxin.
