1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:39,060
to upload on my channel,

2
00:00:39,860 --> 00:00:41,000
get safely back.

3
00:00:41,320 --> 00:00:43,520
I hope our fast and tempo

4
00:00:43,720 --> 00:00:45,400
will get better.

5
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:47,680
Goodbye andberg私 Kanes.

6
00:00:55,800 --> 00:00:56,960
I've almost accomplished

7
00:00:57,200 --> 00:00:58,440
at least ahod.

8
00:00:58,440 --> 00:01:00,160
Just a little bit.

9
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:07,040
I'm going to recover.

10
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:15,280
I just recovered a little bit.

11
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:18,080
No.

12
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:20,400
I have to figure out

13
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:23,600
what happened to Ye Tian.

14
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:25,240
I ...

15
00:01:29,160 --> 00:01:32,360
I should use that to勾 my temper

16
00:01:39,300 --> 00:01:40,740
to bring her closer to me,

17
00:01:41,140 --> 00:01:42,320
then say another time.

18
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:47,640
Let me see her?

19
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:50,200
Please wait a moment.

20
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:51,040
General is poised toör,

21
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:52,160
she has to bid on witching at night,

22
00:01:52,160 --> 00:01:52,900
it is good to beloop one.

23
00:01:52,900 --> 00:01:53,860
Do you want to steal the honor?

24
00:01:54,460 --> 00:01:55,340
Chief Hua,

25
00:01:55,340 --> 00:01:57,340
don't think about the hard bed.

26
00:01:57,580 --> 00:01:59,900
The General ordered me to do it twice.

27
00:02:00,140 --> 00:02:01,660
I didn't see it until then.

28
00:02:02,100 --> 00:02:03,100
But this time,

29
00:02:03,260 --> 00:02:04,780
the General ordered me to do it.

30
00:02:04,940 --> 00:02:06,460
I was forced to be punished

31
00:02:06,620 --> 00:02:08,060
by the military.

32
00:02:09,460 --> 00:02:11,700
How did you offend the General?

33
00:02:12,060 --> 00:02:14,420
You were not well the other day.

34
00:02:15,100 --> 00:02:16,260
I haven't seen the General for a long time.

35
00:02:16,260 --> 00:02:17,420
I'm so angry.

36
00:02:18,620 --> 00:02:21,340
First, we don't call him well.

37
00:02:21,580 --> 00:02:22,460
Here is

38
00:02:22,980 --> 00:02:24,700
where I offended him.

39
00:02:26,260 --> 00:02:27,900
Chief Hua, you should go back.

40
00:02:28,020 --> 00:02:29,260
How can I know?

41
00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:37,780
My brother finally doesn't want to be punished.

42
00:02:39,860 --> 00:02:41,020
He is so polite.

43
00:02:45,740 --> 00:02:46,460
Ye Xun,

44
00:02:46,820 --> 00:02:49,220
you grew up with your brother since you were a kid.

45
00:02:49,340 --> 00:02:50,380
Are you stupid?

46
00:02:50,820 --> 00:02:52,580
Of course, I grew up with him.

47
00:02:55,580 --> 00:02:56,540
You have a way.

48
00:02:56,940 --> 00:02:57,820
Wait for me.

49
00:03:04,300 --> 00:03:05,100
So,

50
00:03:05,100 --> 00:03:07,020
we grew up together?

51
00:03:08,900 --> 00:03:10,540
You were like a pencil-shaping worm

52
00:03:10,540 --> 00:03:11,500
following my brother since you were a kid.

53
00:03:14,260 --> 00:03:15,980
So, we are still

54
00:03:15,980 --> 00:03:17,180
Qingmei and Chu Ma?

55
00:03:18,180 --> 00:03:20,300
How did we know each other before?

56
00:03:23,100 --> 00:03:24,100
We were

57
00:03:24,100 --> 00:03:25,620
the orphans of the Tian Du City since we were kids.

58
00:03:26,980 --> 00:03:28,740
How did you separate from each other?

59
00:03:34,380 --> 00:03:35,940
Don't tell me you don't remember.

60
00:03:39,420 --> 00:03:42,780
Actually, I forgot.

61
00:03:44,020 --> 00:03:46,060
Why do you have such a person?

62
00:03:47,660 --> 00:03:49,820
You don't even know how to wear a beard.

63
00:03:51,180 --> 00:03:52,420
Since you don't remember,

64
00:03:53,020 --> 00:03:54,660
why did you come back?

65
00:03:55,060 --> 00:03:57,260
You will spend your life in the ancient month.

66
00:03:59,620 --> 00:04:00,740
My brother finally

67
00:04:00,740 --> 00:04:02,660
left the hurt you brought him.

68
00:04:02,780 --> 00:04:04,220
Why didn't you let him go?

69
00:04:05,220 --> 00:04:06,260
Wait a minute.

70
00:04:08,220 --> 00:04:09,380
Tell me,

71
00:04:09,380 --> 00:04:11,380
what happened between me and Ye Tian?

72
00:04:11,700 --> 00:04:13,620
I promise I will apologize to him.

73
00:04:13,620 --> 00:04:14,900
I have a way to get away.

74
00:04:17,540 --> 00:04:18,620
Think about it.

75
00:04:19,180 --> 00:04:20,940
If you can't think of it, don't come near me.

76
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:28,500
Where are you going?

77
00:04:48,180 --> 00:04:48,900
General.

78
00:04:49,820 --> 00:04:50,420
What's the matter?

79
00:04:50,620 --> 00:04:52,180
Hua Dao is acting up.

80
00:04:53,060 --> 00:04:53,660
What?

81
00:04:55,340 --> 00:04:57,100
Hua Zhao Yang, Ye Xun will help you deal with it.

82
00:05:03,780 --> 00:05:04,420
You are right.

83
00:05:04,540 --> 00:05:06,780
You can only see me now.

84
00:05:10,540 --> 00:05:11,260
Hua Zhao Yang,

85
00:05:11,900 --> 00:05:13,300
can you be kidding me?

86
00:05:14,780 --> 00:05:15,900
If you leave now,

87
00:05:16,020 --> 00:05:17,900
I will be so embarrassed to accept it.

88
00:05:21,100 --> 00:05:22,700
Can you stop fooling around?

89
00:05:23,980 --> 00:05:24,980
I'm not fooling around.

90
00:05:25,540 --> 00:05:26,500
I just think

91
00:05:27,140 --> 00:05:28,460
I should apologize to you.

92
00:05:31,100 --> 00:05:31,780
Apologize?

93
00:05:37,940 --> 00:05:39,140
Do you remember

94
00:05:39,820 --> 00:05:40,900
why you apologized?

95
00:05:42,700 --> 00:05:43,660
I don't.

96
00:05:46,380 --> 00:05:48,500
But I think I should apologize to you.

97
00:05:51,220 --> 00:05:52,060
You are so ridiculous.

98
00:05:53,660 --> 00:05:55,300
Maybe you think I'm ridiculous,

99
00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:57,260
but I feel wronged.

100
00:06:00,900 --> 00:06:01,980
I don't remember

101
00:06:01,980 --> 00:06:03,780
what happened in General's Mansion.

102
00:06:04,380 --> 00:06:05,500
I don't remember the way

103
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:06,700
from Gu Yue Sect to Tian Du City.

104
00:06:06,860 --> 00:06:08,860
I don't remember when Xiu Luo Yi started.

105
00:06:09,020 --> 00:06:09,860
I don't remember

106
00:06:09,860 --> 00:06:11,140
I even bowed to Gu Yue Sect.

107
00:06:11,140 --> 00:06:12,380
I don't remember anything.

108
00:06:13,380 --> 00:06:14,820
So I don't remember you.

109
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:16,620
I don't care.

110
00:06:27,140 --> 00:06:27,980
Ye Tian,

111
00:06:28,700 --> 00:06:29,540
I just know

112
00:06:30,020 --> 00:06:31,540
that from the moment I started,

113
00:06:31,900 --> 00:06:33,620
I only knew you in this world.

114
00:06:34,620 --> 00:06:35,380
I came here

115
00:06:35,380 --> 00:06:36,380
just for you.

116
00:06:36,380 --> 00:06:37,780
I didn't lie to you.

117
00:06:40,060 --> 00:06:41,060
I didn't lie to you.

118
00:06:43,140 --> 00:06:44,580
And I know

119
00:06:44,580 --> 00:06:45,940
how to restore memory.

120
00:06:48,140 --> 00:06:49,940
You know how to restore memory?

121
00:06:52,540 --> 00:06:55,420
So you always wanted to kiss me

122
00:06:55,660 --> 00:06:57,140
just to return to the sky

123
00:06:57,340 --> 00:06:58,380
and regain your memory?

124
00:07:00,180 --> 00:07:00,980
Help me.

125
00:07:07,060 --> 00:07:08,380
No, you can't touch me.

126
00:07:09,380 --> 00:07:10,300
You know

127
00:07:10,460 --> 00:07:11,340
the flower...

128
00:07:12,380 --> 00:07:13,540
is so beautiful.

129
00:07:13,540 --> 00:07:14,540
I can't touch you.

130
00:07:14,540 --> 00:07:15,540
I can't touch you.

131
00:07:15,540 --> 00:07:16,540
I can't touch you.

132
00:07:16,540 --> 00:07:17,540
I can't touch you.

133
00:07:17,540 --> 00:07:18,540
I can't touch you.

134
00:07:18,540 --> 00:07:19,540
I can't touch you.

135
00:07:19,540 --> 00:07:20,540
I can't touch you.

136
00:07:20,540 --> 00:07:21,540
I can't touch you.

137
00:07:21,540 --> 00:07:22,540
I can't touch you.

138
00:07:22,540 --> 00:07:23,540
I can't touch you.

139
00:07:23,540 --> 00:07:24,540
I can't touch you.

140
00:07:24,540 --> 00:07:25,540
I can't touch you.

141
00:07:25,540 --> 00:07:26,540
I can't touch you.

142
00:07:26,540 --> 00:07:27,540
I can't touch you.

143
00:07:27,540 --> 00:07:28,540
I can't touch you.

144
00:07:28,540 --> 00:07:29,540
I can't touch you.

145
00:07:29,540 --> 00:07:30,540
I can't touch you.

146
00:07:30,540 --> 00:07:31,540
I can't touch you.

147
00:07:31,540 --> 00:07:32,540
I can't touch you.

148
00:07:32,540 --> 00:07:33,540
I can't touch you.

149
00:07:33,540 --> 00:07:34,540
I can't touch you.

150
00:07:34,540 --> 00:07:35,540
I can't touch you.

151
00:07:35,540 --> 00:07:36,540
I can't touch you.

152
00:07:36,540 --> 00:07:37,540
I can't touch you.

153
00:07:37,540 --> 00:07:38,540
I can't touch you.

154
00:07:38,540 --> 00:07:39,540
I can't touch you.

155
00:07:39,540 --> 00:07:40,540
I can't touch you.

156
00:07:42,540 --> 00:07:43,540
I can't touch you.

157
00:07:43,540 --> 00:07:44,540
I can't touch you.

158
00:07:44,540 --> 00:07:45,540
I can't touch you.

159
00:07:45,540 --> 00:07:46,540
I can't touch you.

160
00:07:46,540 --> 00:07:47,540
I can't touch you.

161
00:07:47,540 --> 00:07:48,540
I can't touch you.

162
00:07:48,540 --> 00:07:49,540
I can't touch you.

163
00:07:49,540 --> 00:07:50,540
I can't touch you.

164
00:07:50,540 --> 00:07:51,540
I can't touch you.

165
00:07:51,540 --> 00:07:52,540
I can't touch you.

166
00:07:52,540 --> 00:07:53,540
I can't touch you.

167
00:07:53,540 --> 00:07:54,540
I can't touch you.

168
00:07:54,540 --> 00:07:55,540
I can't touch you.

169
00:07:55,540 --> 00:07:56,540
I can't touch you.

170
00:07:56,540 --> 00:07:57,540
I can't touch you.

171
00:07:57,540 --> 00:07:58,540
I can't touch you.

172
00:07:58,540 --> 00:07:59,540
I can't touch you.

173
00:07:59,540 --> 00:08:00,540
I can't touch you.

174
00:08:00,540 --> 00:08:01,540
I can't touch you.

175
00:08:01,540 --> 00:08:02,540
I can't touch you.

176
00:08:02,540 --> 00:08:03,540
I can't touch you.

177
00:08:03,540 --> 00:08:04,540
I can't touch you.

178
00:08:04,540 --> 00:08:05,540
I can't touch you.

179
00:08:05,540 --> 00:08:06,540
I can't touch you.

180
00:08:06,540 --> 00:08:07,540
I can't touch you.

181
00:08:07,540 --> 00:08:08,540
I can't touch you.

182
00:08:08,540 --> 00:08:09,540
I can't touch you.

183
00:08:10,220 --> 00:08:12,380
How much Starry polishing clay do you absorb?

184
00:08:15,220 --> 00:08:16,700
I told you before.

185
00:08:16,700 --> 00:08:17,700
Only seven or eight loaves of stone become Salted.

186
00:08:17,700 --> 00:08:19,700
It's impossible.

187
00:08:20,740 --> 00:08:22,540
I saw many producers.

188
00:08:22,780 --> 00:08:24,540
Several million Starry pot of ink.

189
00:08:28,300 --> 00:08:29,500
You saw that?

190
00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:30,540
General.

191
00:08:30,860 --> 00:08:31,780
General,

192
00:08:31,780 --> 00:08:33,260
wild pandex festivalะ in the studio now

193
00:08:33,260 --> 00:08:34,460
is infected.

194
00:08:34,460 --> 00:08:35,940
It has inspired them.

195
00:08:36,780 --> 00:08:37,720
Wild pandex Festival is my place.

196
00:08:37,860 --> 00:08:39,260
You should answer our question first.

197
00:08:39,260 --> 00:08:40,100
Hua Zhaoyang,

198
00:08:40,580 --> 00:08:42,380
I have no time to talk about these dreams with you.

199
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:56,180
Yexuan.

200
00:08:56,780 --> 00:08:58,300
Yexuan, don't be afraid.

201
00:08:58,420 --> 00:08:59,180
I'll save you.

202
00:09:02,340 --> 00:09:03,420
No.

203
00:09:03,540 --> 00:09:05,180
I can't let you take the flower.

204
00:09:05,300 --> 00:09:06,420
Have you considered the consequences?

205
00:09:09,260 --> 00:09:10,100
I want to save my brother.

206
00:09:10,220 --> 00:09:10,820
No.

207
00:09:10,980 --> 00:09:12,420
The flower in your body is full.

208
00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:13,540
You can't do that.

209
00:09:14,580 --> 00:09:15,700
What are you talking about?

210
00:09:16,340 --> 00:09:17,940
If you cause more trouble,

211
00:09:18,020 --> 00:09:19,620
what about the people in Tianzong City?

212
00:09:27,820 --> 00:09:28,460
Get out of my way.

213
00:09:29,060 --> 00:09:29,660
No.

214
00:09:29,740 --> 00:09:30,460
No.

215
00:09:39,980 --> 00:09:40,780
Yexuan.

216
00:09:41,220 --> 00:09:41,980
Yexuan.

217
00:09:47,740 --> 00:09:48,500
Yexuan.

218
00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:55,620
What did you do to her?

219
00:10:39,260 --> 00:10:40,140
Yexuan.

220
00:11:09,900 --> 00:11:10,620
Yexuan.

221
00:11:15,300 --> 00:11:16,140
You...

222
00:11:17,020 --> 00:11:18,260
Who the heck are you?

223
00:11:20,540 --> 00:11:21,580
The Celestial HUA Zhaoyang

224
00:11:21,780 --> 00:11:23,060
is coming to pick you up in a bind.

225
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:36,140
The reason why I couldn't take the flower

226
00:11:37,780 --> 00:11:39,220
is the goal.

227
00:11:39,260 --> 00:11:40,900
there is resistance in your body.

228
00:11:41,820 --> 00:11:43,140
Another reason is

229
00:11:44,100 --> 00:11:45,260
that your body's capacity

230
00:11:45,660 --> 00:11:46,660
is almost at the limit.

231
00:11:48,780 --> 00:11:49,380
Brother.

232
00:11:52,980 --> 00:11:54,820
Ye Xun, are you okay?

233
00:11:56,020 --> 00:11:56,940
I'm fine.

234
00:11:59,100 --> 00:11:59,780
Ye Xun,

235
00:12:01,300 --> 00:12:02,100
your brother

236
00:12:02,420 --> 00:12:04,820
has never had any ability to cure Xiu Luo Yi.

237
00:12:05,700 --> 00:12:06,580
What?

238
00:13:40,100 --> 00:13:40,780
Brother.

239
00:13:40,780 --> 00:13:41,580

261
00:14:02,420 --> 00:14:03,420

262
00:14:03,420 --> 00:14:04,420
Brother.

263
00:14:04,420 --> 00:14:05,420
Brother.

264
00:14:05,420 --> 00:14:06,420
Brother.

265
00:14:06,420 --> 00:14:07,420
