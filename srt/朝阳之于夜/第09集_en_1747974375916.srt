00:00:38,880 --> 00:00:39,840
If you prefer not to kneel,

4
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:42,000
you'll only be in the dead of !!

5
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:55,960

9
00:01:05,740 --> 00:01:07,720
This is your replacement drug.

10
00:01:07,960 --> 00:01:08,960
General.

11
00:01:09,880 --> 00:01:12,320
This is me, General.

12
00:01:15,120 --> 00:01:15,700
OK.

13
00:01:16,040 --> 00:01:17,080
It's taken a long time.

14
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:19,280
I'm now a naturalnamer.

15
00:01:19,700 --> 00:01:20,400

18
00:01:24,140 --> 00:01:25,400
is in the prison now.

19
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:26,380
So,

20
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:28,440
you need to return this prison to me.

21
00:01:28,440 --> 00:01:29,960
I can help you solve the problem.

22
00:01:30,120 --> 00:01:30,840
Do you understand?

23
00:01:32,120 --> 00:01:33,480
Is this the jade you said?

24
00:01:37,440 --> 00:01:38,560
It's important to you.

25
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:54,680
Hua Zhao Yang.

26
00:01:55,080 --> 00:01:56,560
Isn't he in the Cuyue Sect?

27
00:01:58,440 --> 00:01:59,240
Yes.

28
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:07,200
The mall is locked down.

29
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:09,080
Where did you find him?

30
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:11,560
I have no idea how he 혼s in here.

31
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:13,080
While we were talking to him,

32
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:14,960
the marriage planning took off

33
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,200
and he fell in門.

34
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:56,340
I

35
00:02:58,440 --> 00:02:59,440
I will help you

36
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:00,740
I will help you

37
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:02,340
Let's go

38
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:27,940
Since the jade jade is so important to you

39
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:32,200
When we were exploring the forest in the capital,

40
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:33,520
where were you?

41
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:39,240
Didn't Gu Yuezong help us to solve the problem?

42
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:43,320
I'm so ashamed to play with you.

43
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:46,200
I'm really a natural.

44
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:47,560
Since you're a natural,

45
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:50,440
why can't you solve the simple problem?

46
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:52,880
That's why I need my jade.

47
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:55,000
Since you want the jade so much,

48
00:03:55,160 --> 00:03:57,080
I'll discuss the conditions with you.

49
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:58,800
It's not a serious matter, girlfriend.

50
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:04,280
Go back to Gu Yuezong and ask everybody to come,

51
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:07,480
and have us solve the repair problem in private.

52
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:09,640
We'll cheer for you then!

53
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:20,640
A bit of postponement remains.

54
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:22,560
We have to give it one go.

55
00:04:27,080 --> 00:04:30,260
tried to sell that untapped cloth won't multi-course for.

56
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:31,960
Oh, right.

57
00:04:32,620 --> 00:04:36,860
up to now I will hurry and do something about,

58
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:39,560
that I haven't done yet,

59
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:43,460
to take a word of encouragement from this tribe.

60
00:04:45,300 --> 00:04:47,500
Oh no!

61
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:50,160
Let's go.

62
00:04:51,300 --> 00:04:52,980
Be granted!

63
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:55,600
Let's go.

64
00:04:57,640 --> 00:04:58,740
Xin shit.

65
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:00,540
Fruit pulp,

66
00:05:01,140 --> 00:05:02,440
Xiao Feng.

67
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:04,560
Out in the wild!

68
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:08,520
Beautific gold!

69
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:13,220
Hua Zhaoyang.

70
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:18,620
Solve my problem?

71
00:05:19,340 --> 00:05:20,340
What do you mean?

72
00:05:22,780 --> 00:05:23,580
Nothing.

73
00:05:25,140 --> 00:05:26,300
Forget it.

74
00:05:26,700 --> 00:05:27,540
I have to

75
00:05:27,740 --> 00:05:29,220
regain my power.

76
00:05:48,140 --> 00:05:48,540
Hey!

77
00:05:49,580 --> 00:05:49,820
Hey!

78
00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:51,220
Why are you smiling?

79
00:05:51,420 --> 00:05:52,540
I am a fruit我想 hit girl

80
00:05:52,540 --> 00:05:53,820
that is enslaved by an idle self-反ar Index.

81
00:05:54,700 --> 00:05:55,060
Maybe

82
00:05:55,420 --> 00:05:57,340
I'll cry you often in my life.

83
00:05:58,340 --> 00:06:00,100
You're still not smart enough.

84
00:06:14,700 --> 00:06:16,020
Look at her smile.

85
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:19,900
Ye Tian, you don't think you can fool me?

86
00:06:19,900 --> 00:06:20,900
Give it back to me!

87
00:06:20,900 --> 00:06:22,300
Give it back to me!

88
00:06:22,300 --> 00:06:26,500
Of course, it's a good thing to see you say goodbye.

89
00:06:28,300 --> 00:06:30,500
But this time, I'll give you a warning.

90
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:32,100
Don't be so mean.

91
00:06:33,100 --> 00:06:36,700
By the way, Ye Xun and I will personally escort you out.

92
00:06:37,300 --> 00:06:39,100
And I'll give you one last warning.

93
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:41,300
Don't touch me.

94
00:06:48,100 --> 00:06:49,100
No.

95
00:06:52,100 --> 00:06:52,700
The next day

96
00:06:52,700 --> 00:06:55,300
Ye Tian, the next day

97
00:06:55,300 --> 00:06:56,900
Ye Tian, the next day

98
00:06:56,900 --> 00:06:58,700
Ye Tian, the next day

99
00:06:58,700 --> 00:06:59,900
He's here.

100
00:07:06,100 --> 00:07:08,300
I said you two are necessary.

101
00:07:08,300 --> 00:07:10,100
Are you looking at me like this?

102
00:07:10,100 --> 00:07:11,100
necessary

103
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:15,900
I tell you, I haven't told you about your arrangement.

104
00:07:15,900 --> 00:07:17,300
I told you.

105
00:07:17,300 --> 00:07:18,700
Don't touch me.

106
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:25,500
Brother, I have something to talk to Zhao Yang alone.

107
00:07:26,700 --> 00:07:29,100
Don't worry, I have my own way.

108
00:07:38,900 --> 00:07:40,100
Say it if you have something to say.

109
00:07:48,300 --> 00:07:49,900
I warn you, Zhao Yang.

110
00:07:50,300 --> 00:07:52,900
This is your last chance to attack.

111
00:07:52,900 --> 00:07:54,300
Don't let me down.

112
00:07:58,100 --> 00:07:59,100
Let me go.

113
00:08:47,900 --> 00:08:48,900
Are you all right?

114
00:08:52,900 --> 00:08:54,300
I'm fine, brother.

115
00:10:17,900 --> 00:10:29,500
Ying questioning.

116
00:10:43,700 --> 00:10:45,200
Don't be sad.

117
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:48,000
Yu is also fake, right?

118
00:10:51,160 --> 00:10:53,000
But she is indeed real.

119
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:56,640
How could you put such important things

120
00:10:56,640 --> 00:10:58,240
on your brother?

121
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:01,120
I didn't expect

122
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:02,520
such an accident to happen.

123
00:11:08,680 --> 00:11:10,000
Are you all right?

124
00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:11,440
I can't recover.

125
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:13,560
I can't go back this time.

126
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:16,360
If you don't go,

127
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:18,160
then don't go back.

128
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:22,480
I don't need you to go back

129
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:24,120
to the ancient month to find a way out.

130
00:11:29,640 --> 00:11:31,680
Why are you still happy?

131
00:11:33,280 --> 00:11:34,560
I'm not happy.

132
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:38,920
How about this?

133
00:11:39,560 --> 00:11:40,400
I'll find out

134
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:41,760
if there is any skillful craftsman

135
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:43,080
who can repair this jade.

136
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:45,040
This is a natural thing.

137
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:46,760
How could you repair this?

138
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:48,720
Well,

139
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:50,480
you're still talking about the dream.

140
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:52,000
I'm relieved.

141
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:54,320
I'm not talking about the dream.

142
00:12:00,280 --> 00:12:01,040
By the way, Yitian,

143
00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:02,600
I have a question for you.

144
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,160
Is there

145
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:05,440
any kind of

146
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:06,560
passable card in your life?

147
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:07,880
It's just a little bit like

148
00:12:07,880 --> 00:12:09,440
if you have any special hatred.

149
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:45,960
I'm not sure.

150
00:13:45,960 --> 00:13:46,960
I'm not sure.

151
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:48,160
I'm not sure.

152
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:48,960
I'm not sure.

153
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:49,960
I'm not sure.

154
00:13:49,960 --> 00:13:50,960
I'm not sure.

155
00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:51,960
I'm not sure.

156
00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:52,960
I'm not sure.

157
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:53,960
I'm not sure.

158
00:13:53,960 --> 00:13:54,960
I'm not sure.

159
00:13:54,960 --> 00:13:55,960
I'm not sure.

160
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:56,960
I'm not sure.

161
00:13:56,960 --> 00:13:57,960
I'm not sure.

162
00:13:57,960 --> 00:13:58,960
I'm not sure.

163
00:13:58,960 --> 00:13:59,960
I'm not sure.

164
00:13:59,960 --> 00:14:00,960
I'm not sure.

165
00:14:00,960 --> 00:14:01,960
I'm not sure.

166
00:14:01,960 --> 00:14:02,960
I'm not sure.

167
00:14:02,960 --> 00:14:03,960
I'm not sure.

168
00:14:03,960 --> 00:14:04,960
I'm not sure.

169
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:05,960
I'm not sure.

170
00:14:05,960 --> 00:14:06,960
I'm not sure.

171
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:07,960
I'm not sure.

172
00:14:07,960 --> 00:14:08,960
I'm not sure.

173
00:14:08,960 --> 00:14:09,960
I'm not sure.

174
00:14:09,960 --> 00:14:10,960
I'm not sure.

175
00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:11,960
I'm not sure.

176
00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:12,960
I'm not sure.

177
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:13,960
I'm not sure.

178
00:14:13,960 --> 00:14:14,960
I'm not sure.
