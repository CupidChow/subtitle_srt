1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
I'd rather die than be.

2
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
I'd rather die than be.

3
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:39,000
I'd rather die than be.

4
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:44,000
The Long Ballad

5
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Episode 1

6
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Rong Yue, do you think your sister and that Ye Tian

7
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
can be a good match?

8
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Master, to be honest,

9
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
I feel like they're both good at dancing.

10
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,000
The two of us are born to be together.

11
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
We're not in the same boat.

12
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
We're meant to be together.

13
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,000
We're meant to be together.

14
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,000
I can't be your sister,

15
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,000
but Ye Tian has his own way of dealing with him.

16
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Ye Tian is a good match for his brother.

17
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:22,000
There are many good partners in the Mugu family.

18
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:27,000
I've been living in the Heavens for over 2000 years.

19
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:31,000
I'd rather like young people like you than be a good partner.

20
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Master, you're a good match for the world.

21
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:40,000
I didn't expect to be a good match for the world.

22
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:44,000
I don't know when I'll have this obsession.

23
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
I always think that if I'm a good partner,

24
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,000
I can cultivate the nature of the world.

25
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Even you and your sister,

26
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,000
I've been waiting for a long time.

27
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
All right.

28
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,000
I'll write a few words in my memory.

29
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
I'll write about the matter of the world.

30
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Rong Yue, did Ye Tian write any script?

31
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
You said you'd listen to me.

32
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
You should be a good partner.

33
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Is it a cloud-like story?

34
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,000
I've read it.

35
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
But so far,

36
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Ye Tian has written two books.

37
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Master, which one do you want to listen to?

38
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
What are the contents?

39
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:26,000
The first one is about the fairy's death.

40
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
She's been accused of breaking the prince.

41
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,000
She saved the life for him.

42
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:34,000
But in the end, she can only protect the past.

43
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:38,000
The second one is about the situation and the situation.

44
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
The prince and the fairy meet again.

45
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:44,000
But in the end, they can only protect the past.

46
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:48,000
In the end, these two are the same.

47
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Master, which one do you want to listen to first?

48
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
This...

49
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Master, what's wrong with you?

50
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
This is really...

51
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:02,000
The fire is shining and the darkness is gone.

52
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,000
The wind is blowing away the fog.

53
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Think about it.

54
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
It's time.

55
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Are you sure it's not a crisis?

56
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Just put 10,000 stars.

57
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:36,000
When the brothers will save us later,

58
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
we'll leave at this time.

59
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:41,000
But you won't be too exaggerated.

60
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
After all, I'm afraid that the ancient moon...

61
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Don't worry.

62
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
I'm just making fun of you.

63
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,000
There won't be any danger.

64
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Don't worry.

65
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Then wait for my sister and Ye Xuan now.

66
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Okay.

67
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
We'll be free from now on.

68
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
The sea is wide and the clouds are clear.

69
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:59,000
The sky is high and the birds are flying.

70
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:24,000
What are you doing? Come in.

71
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
Why are you so nervous when it's so urgent?

72
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
You're afraid that others won't be able to see you.

73
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
I...

74
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Did you see Ye Xuan?

75
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:38,000
He seems to be at the right place.

76
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
At the right place?

77
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Why is he going to the right place now?

78
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
He's getting late.

79
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
How about we go pick him up?

80
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Okay.

81
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:51,000
I'll wait for you here with Zhao Yang.

82
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Then...

83
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:57,000
It's easy for us to be found by other brothers.

84
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:00,000
You go pick him up first.

85
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
You have to show your true feelings.

86
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,000
Okay.

87
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Then wait for me here.

88
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Are you hiding something from me?

89
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
Sister, you're the first time to avoid me.

90
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
What's wrong?

91
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Zhao Yang, you can't go anywhere tonight.

92
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,000
It's not like you saw it that day.

93
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Ye Xuan.

94
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Ye Xuan.

95
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
Didn't you say that you're here?

96
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
The key is to keep your face down.

97
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Ye Xuan.

98
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Ye Xuan.

99
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Shi Su?

100
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Shi Su.

101
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:14,000
I'm the only one who wanted to escape tonight.

102
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
It has nothing to do with the others.

103
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
I deserve to die.

104
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
You're not guilty.

105
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
The answer is...

106
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
Ye Tian.

107
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
I'm sorry.

108
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:33,000
What do you mean by this?

109
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
It's all my fault.

110
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:38,000
I thought that if you found out about Tian Ren Hua,

111
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:41,000
you would have become Tian Ren's hope.

112
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:46,000
But I didn't expect that you're a master of Xiu Luo.

113
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:52,000
I can only kill you if Tian Ren is the first one.

114
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
No way.

115
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
How could Ye Tian be Xiu Luo?

116
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Master, he's definitely a master.

117
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
There are so many Xiu Luo in the world.

118
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
I think you're the master.

119
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
He's the master of Xiu Luo.

120
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:07,000
You don't know what happened.

121
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
He's the master of Xiu Luo.

122
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
What do you mean?

123
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
What's wrong with you?

124
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
Don't you believe me?

125
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:21,000
Anyway, I can't just watch Ye Tian suffer.

126
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
I have to save him.

127
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
I'm back.

128
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Sister, you're not my opponent.

129
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
I won't let you go.

130
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
Xiu Luo is a master of Xiu Luo.

131
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
I just want to...

132
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:41,000
Your words make me lose a lot of time.

133
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:56,000
I don't know why these things happened.

134
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
I don't remember it clearly.

135
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:01,000
It's like the fog in the mountains.

136
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
It's not like it's a dead end.

137
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,000
But your story

138
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
made me lose everything.

139
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:14,000
I don't know why I was so close to the end of my memory.

140
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:18,000
But you're the real person.

141
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
Your so-called inspiration

142
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:24,000
is just a memory of the past.

143
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:37,000
I've met countless people in 2000.

144
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:41,000
You and His Majesty are like a general.

145
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:44,000
I was originally just a coincidence.

146
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Now I think about it,

147
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:52,000
I know that everything is a fate.

148
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
I'm not a person.

149
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
I'm just a person.

150
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
I'm just a person.

151
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
I'm just a person.

152
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:03,000
Everything is a fate.

153
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
The two of them

154
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:09,000
were probably the most stubborn of Xiu Luo.

155
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:14,000
Now it's your turn.

156
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:22,000
Master, you told me before

157
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:25,000
that Xiu Luo was hurt by the evil year.

158
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
But I...

159
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
I'm a player.

160
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,000
This...

161
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
This is also where I'm most loyal.

162
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:36,000
Maybe the evil year is still alive.

163
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:39,000
But I can't wait for the future of the Heavens.

164
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:42,000
The tragedy is still fixed.

165
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:45,000
Xiu Luo will surely come back.

166
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,000
Shaoyang,

167
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
Master won't be wrong.

168
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:55,000
Ye Tian is a player who can only be turned into Xiu Luo.

169
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:58,000
As the most capable disciple of the Gu Yue Sect,

170
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
you can be a natural.

171
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
The safety of the whole world is in your hands.

172
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
You can't just leave the world.

173
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
What kind of a person is a natural?

174
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:10,000
I only know that if something happens to Ye Tian,

175
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
I will leave here.

176
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
I only hope that when you appear again,

177
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:18,000
a natural person can stop you.

178
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,000
Master.

179
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,000
Master.

180
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
It's really strange.

181
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,000
Master!

182
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,000
Master!

183
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,000
I beg you!

184
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
Don't kill Ye Tian!
