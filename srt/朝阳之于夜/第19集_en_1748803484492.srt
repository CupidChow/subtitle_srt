1
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,960
Your cultivation talent is indeed lower.

2
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:04,160
Dan Tian and Jing Man

3
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:06,800
are weaker than the other disciples of the same sect.

4
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:09,880
Your physical quality is not good enough.

5
00:01:12,160 --> 00:01:13,680
Does that mean

6
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:16,520
my brother is not good enough for me?

7
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:17,840
Who said that?

8
00:01:19,240 --> 00:01:20,600
My cultivation talent

9
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:23,200
is not as good as Zhao Yao's.

10
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:25,080
I'm not good enough for you.

11
00:01:25,720 --> 00:01:26,800
I'm not good enough for you.

12
00:01:27,440 --> 00:01:28,560
I'm not good enough for you.

13
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:30,600
Compared to Zhao Yao,

14
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:32,040
you're not worth mentioning.

15
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:33,760
But I can still become

16
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:35,200
the senior sister of the Gu Yue Sect

17
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:37,040
and rely on my cultivation talent.

18
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:38,680
So,

19
00:01:39,160 --> 00:01:40,280
cultivation skills

20
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:42,080
don't just require talent.

21
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:44,240
More importantly, it requires talent and hard work.

22
00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:45,960
Such a concept

23
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:48,760
is far more important than talent.

24
00:01:52,440 --> 00:01:53,760
If you want to help your brother

25
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:54,760
and protect your brother,

26
00:01:55,080 --> 00:01:56,240
I can only use other ways

27
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:57,480
to support your cultivation.

28
00:01:58,720 --> 00:02:00,160
To make high-quality elixir,

29
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:01,640
to use magic bars,

30
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:02,800
to help the curse,

31
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:04,200
these things

32
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:05,440
might make you suffer.

33
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:07,680
If you can stand it,

34
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:10,520
you can get out of the clan.

35
00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:15,600
What's so scary about that?

36
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:18,080
Thank you, Master.

37
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:23,680
You two

38
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:25,600
are more heartbreaking.

39
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:27,520
Those two

40
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:30,080
are always the most humiliating.

41
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:31,400
Master,

42
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:33,120
I'll go get the elixir for you.

43
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:34,400
The elixir

44
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:38,920
is still useful

45
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:40,200
to the elderly in their 70s and 80s.

46
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:42,400
Your master and I

47
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:44,720
are already over 2000 years old.

48
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:46,280
The elixir

49
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:48,600
is useless.

50
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:50,640
Why is it useless?

51
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,120
I don't allow you to say that.

52
00:02:58,040 --> 00:02:58,800
Yan Xun.

53
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:01,160
Master.

54
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:05,320
What do you think of your master?

55
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,680
He didn't trust me at first.

56
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:09,800
But maybe he found out later.

57
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,520
He's very nice to me now.

58
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:13,720
He didn't check you at all.

59
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:19,480
He trusts you.

60
00:03:27,860 --> 00:03:28,760
Immediately.

61
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:36,880
Over.

62
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:38,760
I'll have a good night's rest,

63
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:53,840
with and without

64
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:54,800
is my good.

65
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:57,400
But your master, Rong Yue,

66
00:03:58,320 --> 00:03:59,360
has been

67
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:01,000
thinking about

68
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:03,120
his sister all these years.

69
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:06,480
He only knows how to cultivate

70
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:09,440
and it's not good for him.

71
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:11,680
Then...

72
00:04:13,160 --> 00:04:14,520
What should I do?

73
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:18,320
If I knew, I wouldn't ask you.

74
00:04:18,840 --> 00:04:19,960
Your brother,

75
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:21,680
does he usually

76
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:23,360
write a book?

77
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:25,720
Yes.

78
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:28,240
You can find inspiration from it

79
00:04:28,840 --> 00:04:31,440
and see if there's any way

80
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:33,880
to make your master's life

81
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:35,280
more wonderful

82
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:37,240
and rich.

83
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,600
I'll do my best.

84
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:41,120
In this case,

85
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:44,320
after Zhao Yang becomes a god,

86
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:47,160
after Zhao Yang becomes a god,

87
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:51,480
you'll be Rong Yue's new companion.

88
00:04:55,640 --> 00:04:56,520
Maybe

89
00:04:57,480 --> 00:04:58,760
you're ready to leave

90
00:04:58,760 --> 00:05:00,800
the Night Sky.

91
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:16,320
The Night Sky

92
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:35,480
Master, you want to see me?

93
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:42,240
Where did you get this book?

94
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:44,080
I picked it up by the river.

95
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:46,040
Oh.

96
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:48,480
You've read it?

97
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:49,320
No.

98
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:50,480
It was so wet.

99
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:51,560
I didn't have time to read it.

100
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:52,240
Right.

101
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:54,240
The book is already like this.

102
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:55,600
I'll take it away.

103
00:05:56,440 --> 00:05:57,680
I've dried it for you.

104
00:05:58,640 --> 00:05:59,320
Besides,

105
00:05:59,320 --> 00:06:00,800
this is your cultivation notebook.

106
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:02,280
I'll have to read it.

107
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:03,120
Read it for me.

108
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:08,760
I just wrote it.

109
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:10,760
It's not a question.

110
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:12,200
Read it.

111
00:06:42,760 --> 00:06:44,560
It's a spiritual connection

112
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:47,200
between Yongquan and foreign officials.

113
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:48,640
With this ability,

114
00:06:48,640 --> 00:06:49,800
Rong Hui's cultivation notebook

115
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:53,400
reminds me of

116
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:56,240
the Northern Realm's history.

117
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:58,760
The fierce beast's manpower

118
00:06:58,760 --> 00:07:00,600
and the connection between these two schools

119
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:02,720
are a perfect match.

120
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:03,640
Wait.

121
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,120
You've been to the Northern Realm?

122
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:09,960
Master.

123
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:11,640
Are you interested?

124
00:07:12,520 --> 00:07:13,120
No.

125
00:07:13,640 --> 00:07:14,440
No.

126
00:07:14,440 --> 00:07:15,280
I'm just listening.

127
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:19,360
It's a cold and barren land.

128
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:20,960
Ye Xun and I

129
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:23,160
were shot to death.

130
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:25,480
Then...

131
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:27,320
Is there anything to eat?

132
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:28,880
There is...

133
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:34,840
There is.

134
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,840
Golden tangerine cakes.

135
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:41,360
Golden tangerine cakes?

136
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:44,960
It sounds so delicious.

137
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:47,600
It's really delicious.

138
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:49,160
After Ye Xun and I got there,

139
00:07:49,160 --> 00:07:50,920
we ate every meal.

140
00:07:52,520 --> 00:07:53,640
It's so delicious.

141
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:54,920
Now that I think about it,

142
00:07:54,920 --> 00:07:55,800
I still want to eat it.

143
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:01,280
Anyway,

144
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:03,440
it's very interesting there.

145
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:04,160
Of course.

146
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:05,560
Besides these,

147
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:06,360
there are...

148
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:13,040
Actually,

149
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:14,280
it's quite interesting.

150
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,400
It's not that annoying.

151
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:22,600
Ye Tian.

152
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:27,800
Don't leave me.

153
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:31,320
I'm sorry.

154
00:08:31,320 --> 00:08:32,360
I'm sorry.

155
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:33,360
I'm sorry.

156
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:34,360
I'm sorry.

157
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:35,360
I'm sorry.

158
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:36,360
I'm sorry.

159
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:37,360
I'm sorry.

160
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:38,360
I'm sorry.

161
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:39,360
I'm sorry.

162
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:40,360
I'm sorry.

163
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:41,360
I'm sorry.

164
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:42,360
I'm sorry.

165
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:43,360
I'm sorry.

166
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:50,360
Don't forget me, Ye Tian.

167
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:01,040
No wonder.

168
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:02,640
No wonder.

169
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:12,640
Brother.

170
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:28,600
What are you doing here in the middle of the night?

171
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:30,640
Xun'er, let me ask you.

172
00:09:31,160 --> 00:09:32,800
If a person falls asleep,

173
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:36,320
he keeps calling the other person's name in his dream.

174
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:38,200
What does it mean?

175
00:09:38,280 --> 00:09:40,000
facing for the role of acceptor in the chaos?

176
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:49,680
It means

177
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:51,880
she had long enough in your dream.

178
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:57,880
Is this the so-called dream world?

179
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:02,080
No wonder

180
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:05,480
she has done so much to keep me in the Moon Sect.

181
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:07,760
What's this?

182
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:09,480
but does nothing but like me.

183
00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:13,720
Now,

184
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:15,680
I have reached to Mister Fortune.

185
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:30,140
So this is your brother's

186
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:30,760
regular practice?

187
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:32,040
Yes,ש oneself is

188
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:35,400
another kind of Taoism.

189
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:36,800
It's true that

190
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:38,800
the crystal killed me.

191
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:40,040
Killed me?

192
00:10:40,520 --> 00:10:41,120
Well,

193
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:43,000
does it still look good?

194
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:45,080
The pattern is good.

195
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:46,240
It's worth selling.

196
00:10:46,760 --> 00:10:47,400
Sell it.

197
00:10:50,920 --> 00:10:53,640
I only see that it cuts through the skin

198
00:10:54,040 --> 00:10:55,280
and the veins are painful.

199
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:56,240
That ability...

200
00:10:57,840 --> 00:10:58,560
Stop talking nonsense.

201
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:02,640
Master taught me...

202
00:11:03,640 --> 00:11:06,000
Blood vessels are painful.

203
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:12,960
What are they doing

204
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:14,320
secretly?

205
00:11:15,880 --> 00:11:17,080
You still have the heart

206
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:19,200
to think about others?

207
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:22,040
What are you doing?

208
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:23,960
Why are you so weird today?

209
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:25,240
What about you?

210
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:27,280
Is it because

211
00:11:27,640 --> 00:11:29,880
you have a heavy feeling

212
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:31,520
that's why you're acting like this?

213
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:34,520
Look at it!
