1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
I'm not as good as you

2
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
I'm just a good man

3
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:39,000
and I'm still a good man

4
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Episode 13

5
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Episode 13

6
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Episode 14

7
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Is there anything you can't go through in this life?

8
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,000
It's just a little bit like

9
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
if you have any special hatred for me,

10
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,000
or if you want something special,

11
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
the one you hate the most,

12
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
the one you want the most,

13
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
the one you hate the most.

14
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Why are you looking at me?

15
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
You don't hate me, do you?

16
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
The one you want the most,

17
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
how could I hate you?

18
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:26,000
If you have to choose one,

19
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
it should be Xiu Luo Yi.

20
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Because I really don't want to see

21
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000
the people in Tian Du City suffer.

22
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,000
No, no, no.

23
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,000
It's definitely not like that.

24
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,000
There must be something else.

25
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,000
Think about it again.

26
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Forget it.

27
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,000
It seems that I can only not take care of the power of the heavens

28
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
and open your own grudge.

29
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Grudge?

30
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,000
I really don't have any grudges.

31
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,000
General!

32
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,000
General!

33
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,000
General,

34
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
maybe the doctor will find you to take the medicine room.

35
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Okay.

36
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,000
I'll go with you.

37
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Brother.

38
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
The letter of the letter has been taken out.

39
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Okay.

40
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,000
The letter of the letter

41
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
has been written.

42
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
I, Hua Zhao Yang, am glad to help you.

43
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Your jade...

44
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Don't mention jade or not.

45
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
I'm sorry.

46
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Are you in a hurry?

47
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Okay.

48
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Isn't this the ordinary herb water?

49
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Can this cure Xiu Luo Yi?

50
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
I'm just a transfer.

51
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
I don't know the rules.

52
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
The person who can eliminate the people in Bian An Hua

53
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,000
is my brother.

54
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Ye Xuan,

55
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,000
you and Hua Zhao Yang

56
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,000
send the person back first

57
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,000
and tell the brothers.

58
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,000
From today on,

59
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,000
we'll have to increase the number of troops.

60
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Okay.

61
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Let's go.

62
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
What's going on?

63
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:46,000
If we compare Yin Yang Yu with this tea pot,

64
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,000
the tea water inside is the power of the sky.

65
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:52,000
If we compare the night sky with this tea cup,

66
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:57,000
when he touches the jade,

67
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:02,000
the power of the sky enters his body.

68
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
He becomes my jade.

69
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Then I...

70
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,000
I'll be fine after I breathe.

71
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
In order to get me back the power,

72
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
I can only make you suffer.

73
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,000
What are you doing

74
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,000
at this late night?

75
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,000
Didn't you promise me

76
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
to help me fix jade?

77
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Fix jade?

78
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Does this have anything to do with the repair?

79
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
This is a waste of time.

80
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
I can't explain so much to you.

81
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Let me kiss you.

82
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Don't touch me.

83
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
What are you insisting on?

84
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
I'm not that insistent

85
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
with a girl's family.

86
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
This has nothing to do with

87
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,000
being insistent.

88
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
I feel that you're very wrong.

89
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Yes.

90
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
That's why I need to

91
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,000
get back the power.

92
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Come on, kiss me.

93
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,000
I don't understand

94
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
what you're talking about.

95
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,000
But Zong'er,

96
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,000
don't touch me.

97
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Just let me kiss you.

98
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Kiss me.

99
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
I can't kiss you.

100
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Ye Tian!

101
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,000
Stop.

102
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,000
What are you doing?

103
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
Let go of me.

104
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Take her away.

105
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Yes.

106
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Let's go.

107
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Let's go.

108
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
What's wrong with your kiss?

109
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000
Let's go.

110
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Do you want me to kiss you?

111
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,000
What's wrong with you?

112
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
What's wrong?

113
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,000
It's nothing.

114
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,000
You're the only one who can kiss me.

115
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,000
What's wrong with you?

116
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,000
I'll kiss you, too.

117
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
What's wrong with you?

118
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,000
I'll kiss you.

119
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,000
It's okay.

120
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,000
It's okay.

121
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Don't hide.

122
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,000
Come out.

123
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,000
You're not hiding from me?

124
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,000
It's useless.

125
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,720
compared to the past.

126
00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:39,680
It's really too much.

127
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:40,960
I'm not worried.

128
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:45,920
Then let me kiss you.

129
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:47,040
You're not ashamed.

130
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:49,920
Didn't I say

131
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:50,920
not to let you touch me?

132
00:07:51,640 --> 00:07:52,640
You don't know

133
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:54,280
how I got the treatment.

134
00:07:55,480 --> 00:07:56,360
Aren't you afraid?

135
00:07:56,920 --> 00:07:57,720
I'm not afraid.

136
00:07:58,840 --> 00:07:59,440
No.

137
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:01,080
How do you know that I know?

138
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:04,120
Just like just now,

139
00:08:04,280 --> 00:08:05,600
you hide behind and look behind.

140
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:08,000
Do you think I didn't find it?

141
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:25,120
A year ago,

142
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:27,960
Tian Du City suddenly appeared in the fourth-grade Xiu Luo Yi.

143
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:30,080
This disease

144
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:31,640
was originally just a legend.

145
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:33,520
But suddenly,

146
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,480
it happened.

147
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:38,680
I feel very sad

148
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:41,360
when I see the people suffer.

149
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:44,320
It's also a rare opportunity.

150
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:45,520
I found that

151
00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:47,480
I have the ability to absorb the flower.

152
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:49,720
At first,

153
00:08:49,840 --> 00:08:52,000
I was worried if there would be bad consequences.

154
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:54,120
But now it's been a year.

155
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:55,680
There's nothing wrong with it.

156
00:08:57,880 --> 00:08:59,160
What kind of life do you think

157
00:08:59,160 --> 00:09:00,920
the flower is?

158
00:09:03,160 --> 00:09:04,520
Sometimes I think

159
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:06,840
I'm sent to

160
00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:08,960
cure Xiu Luo Yi.

161
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:14,280
How many times have you been cured?

162
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:16,840
I can't remember the exact details.

163
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:20,400
About 70 to 80 times.

164
00:09:24,040 --> 00:09:27,200
So you don't let others touch you?

165
00:09:27,520 --> 00:09:29,160
Because you're afraid that

166
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:30,680
they'll infect Xiu Luo Yi?

167
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:35,600
I think

168
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:45,280
after추 countdown again,

169
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:47,880
I still have to leave at work.

170
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:00,360
Are you out of your mind?

171
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:01,900
Look,

172
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:03,180
do you mind if I Wahrance it?

173
00:10:03,180 --> 00:10:04,300
Youchun.

174
00:10:05,020 --> 00:10:06,140
Do not ask me

175
00:10:07,420 --> 00:10:09,140
to know hydration.

176
00:10:10,700 --> 00:10:11,820
Ahli,

177
00:10:13,180 --> 00:10:14,500
you the而srut

178
00:10:18,340 --> 00:10:20,060
Jiang Chen 걔

179
00:10:20,540 --> 00:10:22,340
Jiang Chen 걔

180
00:10:22,940 --> 00:10:23,700
Jiang Chen 걔

181
00:10:23,700 --> 00:10:24,740
Jiang Chen 걔

182
00:10:25,100 --> 00:10:26,060
into the stamps

183
00:10:26,220 --> 00:10:30,060
In thedetermination of the price

184
00:10:30,420 --> 00:10:32,700
Jiang Chen loved the food

185
00:10:34,020 --> 00:10:34,980
Since you don't want to talk about it,

186
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:37,140
I'll come and ask.

187
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:41,660
When Gu Yue was the suppositor,

188
00:10:42,620 --> 00:10:43,980
you promised me clearly,

189
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:45,260
you wouldn't go.

190
00:10:47,020 --> 00:10:48,940
However, once you disappear is all over the place.

191
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,840
Why do I deserve an explanation?

192
00:10:58,160 --> 00:11:00,000
