This moment

57
00:03:18,620 --> 00:03:20,620
I can only hope that he will be completely closed

58
00:03:20,620 --> 00:03:23,620
And become a human

59
00:03:25,620 --> 00:03:27,620
Hua Zhao Yang

60
00:03:27,620 --> 00:03:29,620
Closed for five years

61
00:03:29,620 --> 00:03:31,620
You should wake up

62
00:03:45,620 --> 00:03:48,620
What's the situation

63
00:03:48,620 --> 00:03:51,620
Why is there a very strong evil spirit in the sect

64
00:04:01,620 --> 00:04:03,620
Listen to my command

65
00:04:05,620 --> 00:04:07,620
Go

66
00:04:15,620 --> 00:04:17,620
Go

67
00:04:45,620 --> 00:04:48,620
Go

68
00:04:48,620 --> 00:04:51,620
Go

00:04:51,620 --> 00:04:54,620

71
00:04:57,620 --> 00:05:00,620
Go

72
00:05:00,620 --> 00:05:02,620
Heaven

73
00:05:02,620 --> 00:05:04,620
You are awake

74
00:05:04,620 --> 00:05:07,620
I don't like the name of Heaven

75
00:05:07,620 --> 00:05:10,620
You can call me Hua Zhao Yang

76
00:05:10,620 --> 00:05:13,620
Hua Zhao Yang

77
00:05:13,620 --> 00:05:14,620
I'll take care of it.

78
00:05:15,660 --> 00:05:17,220
Just let me finish it.

79
00:05:19,140 --> 00:05:20,180
Remember,

80
00:05:21,420 --> 00:05:23,340
no one is allowed to give money.

81
00:05:24,540 --> 00:05:26,740
This is not something you can participate in.

82
00:05:27,460 --> 00:05:28,460
Yes.

83
00:06:44,220 --> 00:06:45,460
No one else rules this world.

84
00:06:45,460 --> 00:07:10,120
Meeting�이

85
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:11,800
We have tried

86
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:14,040
It's a pity

87
00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:17,080
that you lost Jin Yi.

88
00:07:22,280 --> 00:07:23,120
We...

89
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:43,760
Zhao Yang.

90
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:46,440
Master.

91
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:51,640
Everything is as Gu Ji said.

92
00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:54,640
Although the Pillar of the Deceased was born from the bad years,

93
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:56,760
it's still a gift from Heaven.

94
00:07:57,160 --> 00:07:58,640
It's been a thousand years since the Lamp of the Bitterness.

95
00:07:58,640 --> 00:08:00,320
I can witness that

96
00:08:00,640 --> 00:08:04,080
the Lamp of the Bitterness is also my wish.

97
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:05,400
Zhao Yang,

98
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:08,280
you've done a lot of meritorious deeds to help the Pillar.

99
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:10,840
Now you're only missing the ladder of the Lamp of the Bitterness

100
00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:12,920
and become the real Heavenly Man.

101
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:16,400
Just let Yin and Yang meet.

102
00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:19,520
That's the key to what the book says.

103
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:22,400
Did Master give this to me before?

104
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:24,840
Why can't I remember it?

105
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:26,760
You've been in seclusion for five years.

106
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:28,880
You've forgotten a lot of things.

107
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:30,960
But it doesn't matter.

108
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:32,840
Go to the Lamp of the Bitterness.

109
00:08:33,160 --> 00:08:35,480
What will happen after I become the Heavenly Man?

110
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:39,120
The Heavenly Land is as flat as a city.

111
00:08:39,160 --> 00:08:40,960
The Pillar of the Bitterness is in the Lamp of the Bitterness.

112
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:43,360
That's the blessing from the Heavenly Land.

113
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:45,560
As for what will happen to you,

114
00:08:45,560 --> 00:08:47,520
it's not something that a mortal like you

115
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:48,840
can answer.

116
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:51,600
I'll wait for you to come back

117
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:53,560
and deliver the message.

118
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:57,440
Master.

119
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:12,920
The Lamp of the Bitterness

120
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:41,360
Hua Zhao Yang.

121
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:43,600
The Lamp of the Bitterness is not yet removed.

122
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:46,920
How dare you step on the ladder of the Heavenly Land?

123
00:09:48,520 --> 00:09:49,400
What?

124
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:56,080
Take a good look at your Lamp of the Bitterness.

125
00:09:56,400 --> 00:09:59,040
It's still in the Lamp of the Bitterness.

126
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:03,160
But I've already...

127
00:10:03,160 --> 00:10:05,400
It's just a fall.

128
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:07,440
You can't get out of it.

129
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:08,400
Master.

130
00:10:08,920 --> 00:10:10,880
You've broken the Heavenly Law.

131
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:13,680
You can't leave without coming back.

132
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:16,800
I'll send you to the Lamp of the Bitterness

133
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:20,680
and wipe out the evil of the Pillar of the Bitterness.

134
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:39,520
Ye Tian.

135
00:10:39,880 --> 00:10:42,400
You've been a little too excited lately.

136
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:44,960
Tell me.

137
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:47,480
What did that old man tell you?

138
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:51,280
He didn't tell me anything.

139
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:53,760
You're a bad-tempered man.

140
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:55,160
Why must you do this to me?

141
00:10:58,840 --> 00:10:59,760
It's okay.

142
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:02,240
I have some time to play with you.

143
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:06,320
Qing Tian, stop here.

144
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:08,560
You have to keep your life.

145
00:11:09,280 --> 00:11:10,240
Get lost.

146
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:11,800
Don't get in my way.

147
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:13,880
Don't let me catch the evidence.

148
00:11:14,280 --> 00:11:15,720
Go back to your mansion.

149
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:17,040
Don't come out to show your face.

150
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:21,200
You know what to do next, right?

151
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:22,640
I know.

152
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:28,600
I won't let my father know about what happened today.

153
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:32,480
I'll go to the pharmacy outside the palace

154
00:11:33,880 --> 00:11:35,800
and not be affected by the meaning.

155
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:38,560
You're so stubborn.

156
00:11:39,280 --> 00:11:40,640
You're a good man.

157
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:42,360
Remember.

158
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:44,400
Although you're a bastard

159
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:45,680
and you're promoted to be a prince,

160
00:11:46,360 --> 00:11:48,440
your brother has no identity.

161
00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:50,400
He's either alive or dead.

162
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:52,960
It's all up to you.

163
00:11:59,840 --> 00:12:00,880
Banxia.

164
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:03,280
Dongqing.

165
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:04,760
Tingning.

166
00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:06,840
How much can this batch of herbs cost?

167
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:08,880
Almost.

168
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:11,320
And 72 taels.

169
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:12,240
You...

170
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:13,520
Are you out of your mind?

171
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:14,920
You can't find these herbs

172
00:12:14,920 --> 00:12:16,080
anywhere during this season.

173
00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:17,640
I went to the mountains with all my might.

174
00:12:17,840 --> 00:12:19,240
They're all top quality.

175
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:21,480
Miss Rong Yue, don't be anxious.

176
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:23,600
It's a good deal to pay off the debt.

177
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:25,480
Your sister owes me the money.

178
00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:27,160
I didn't force you to pick herbs.

179
00:12:27,160 --> 00:12:28,880
These herbs are valuable.

180
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:31,080
But you should go to see your sister.

181
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:32,720
There.

182
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:35,920
Thanks.

183
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:37,840
Director Fang must be over there.

184
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:38,720
That's right.

185
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:40,920
I guess we should talk to Taste tradition.

186
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:42,720
He is not willing to play tricks on me.

187
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:44,040
That's right.

188
00:12:45,280 --> 00:12:46,000
It's OK.

189
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,920
Navigate Cherish.

190
00:12:51,160 --> 00:12:51,960
Have a nice day.

191
00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:57,960
Appreciate it.

192
00:13:04,760 --> 00:13:05,760
to treat people with medicine.

193
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:06,760
It's a bill.

194
00:13:06,760 --> 00:13:07,760
These days,

195
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:09,760
you eat and use me.

196
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:11,760
It's another bill.

197
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:13,760
The old bill and the new bill.

198
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:15,760
You and your sister.

199
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:17,760
This bill can't be settled.

200
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:19,760
Hua Zhao Yang.

201
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:23,760
It's time.

202
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:26,760
Sister.

203
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:30,760
Sister, I haven't finished eating yet.

204
00:13:30,760 --> 00:13:32,760
Don't argue.

205
00:13:32,760 --> 00:13:34,760
Your sister has a legendary

206
00:13:34,760 --> 00:13:35,760
human flower.

207
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:37,760
Why don't you give it to me?

208
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:39,760
Don't talk about the bill.

209
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:40,760
The money I want to get

210
00:13:40,760 --> 00:13:41,760
is enough for you two

211
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:43,760
to eat for half a lifetime.

212
00:13:44,760 --> 00:13:46,760
Don't get in my way.

213
00:13:46,760 --> 00:13:49,760
I finally found this human flower.

214
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:50,760
I'm a cultivator.

215
00:13:50,760 --> 00:13:52,760
It's my dream to be a human.

216
00:13:52,760 --> 00:13:53,760
Besides,

217
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:55,760
since there is a human flower,

218
00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:57,760
there must be a human.

219
00:14:02,760 --> 00:14:03,760
Sister.

220
00:14:04,760 --> 00:14:06,760
I think no one has ever seen

221
00:14:06,760 --> 00:14:09,760
this human.

222
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:11,760
It's just a legend in ancient times.

223
00:14:14,760 --> 00:14:16,760
How about...

224
00:14:24,760 --> 00:14:25,760
What's wrong with you?

225
00:14:32,760 --> 00:14:33,760
Go.

226
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:58,760
Go find it in the reincarnation.

227
00:14:58,760 --> 00:15:00,760
Your power of the human will be

228
00:15:00,760 --> 00:15:02,760
sealed into the soul

229
00:15:02,760 --> 00:15:05,760
and follow you into the reincarnation.

230
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:07,760
Your memory will also be sealed

231
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:09,760
into the depths of the soul

232
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:12,760
and wait to be awakened.

233
00:15:30,760 --> 00:15:33,760
I want to spend the rest of my life with you.

234
00:15:33,760 --> 00:15:37,760
I want to spend the rest of my life with you.

235
00:15:37,760 --> 00:15:42,760
I want to spend the rest of my life with you.

236
00:15:42,760 --> 00:15:46,760
I want to spend the rest of my life with you.

237
00:15:46,760 --> 00:15:50,760
I want to spend the rest of my life with you.

238
00:15:50,760 --> 00:15:54,760
I want to spend the rest of my life with you.

239
00:15:54,760 --> 00:15:57,760
I want to spend the rest of my life with you.

240
00:15:57,760 --> 00:16:00,760
I want to spend the rest of my life with you.

241
00:16:00,760 --> 00:16:03,760
I want to spend the rest of my life with you.

242
00:16:03,760 --> 00:16:06,760
I want to spend the rest of my life with you.

243
00:16:06,760 --> 00:16:09,760
I want to spend the rest of my life with you.

244
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:12,760
I want to spend the rest of my life with you.

245
00:16:12,760 --> 00:16:15,760
I want to spend the rest of my life with you.

246
00:16:15,760 --> 00:16:18,760
I want to spend the rest of my life with you.

247
00:16:18,760 --> 00:16:21,760
I want to spend the rest of my life with you.

248
00:16:21,760 --> 00:16:24,760
I want to spend the rest of my life with you.

249
00:16:24,760 --> 00:16:27,760
I don't care about the future.

250
00:16:27,760 --> 00:16:31,760
I just want to spend the rest of my life with you.

251
00:16:31,760 --> 00:16:36,760
I'm afraid that I'll be with you.

252
00:16:36,760 --> 00:16:41,760
I just want to spend the rest of my life with you.
