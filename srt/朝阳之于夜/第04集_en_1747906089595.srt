1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
The Legend of Chusen

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Episode 21

3
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,000
Episode 16

4
00:00:59,360 --> 00:01:00,480
It's quite rich.

5
00:01:01,880 --> 00:01:02,960
It's salty enough to eat.

6
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:03,840
Try it.

7
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:04,480
Okay.

8
00:01:07,480 --> 00:01:08,480
It's quite fragrant.

9
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:12,960
Is it good?

10
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:15,400
Sweet and tasty.

11
00:01:16,520 --> 00:01:17,280
Of course.

12
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:18,960
I picked them from the mountain.

13
00:01:19,440 --> 00:01:20,880
When my sister and I were on the mountain,

14
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:22,240
we often picked fruits.

15
00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:25,040
When we were thirsty, we drank the spring water in the mountain.

16
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:27,160
When we were hungry, we ate the wild fruits on the mountain.

17
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:28,120
By the way,

18
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:30,040
your natural flower

19
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:32,040
was picked by me

20
00:01:32,360 --> 00:01:33,800
when I was picking herbs on the mountain.

21
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:36,000
The saving grace of the flower-tooth-picking stone

22
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:37,480
will be remembered forever.

23
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:39,440
You did a good thing.

24
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:43,560
I'm relieved that the flower-tooth-picking stone

25
00:01:43,960 --> 00:01:44,960
can stay in the palace.

26
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:46,640
Don't worry.

27
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:48,720
I, Hua Zhaoyang, will not drink for nothing.

28
00:01:49,760 --> 00:01:50,640
I also know that

29
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:51,680
you want me to help you

30
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:53,120
to cure His Majesty's injury.

31
00:01:53,440 --> 00:01:54,480
I will do my best.

32
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:55,680
Although

33
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,040
I'm just a little girl

34
00:01:57,240 --> 00:01:59,120
who doesn't know much about the world,

35
00:01:59,440 --> 00:02:00,800
I'm still a high-class person.

36
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:02,760
When I picked the natural flower,

37
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:03,520
I knew that

38
00:02:03,880 --> 00:02:06,560
there must be a natural person in the world.

39
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:09,480
I, Hua Zhaoyang, will definitely become a natural person

40
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:11,280
and do justice for the heaven.

41
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:15,200
I didn't believe it before.

42
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:17,720
But now I believe in the flower-tooth-picking stone.

43
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:19,760
You can definitely achieve your dream

44
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:20,960
and become a natural person.

45
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:28,960
What's wrong?

46
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,440
I suddenly feel very uncomfortable.

47
00:02:32,440 --> 00:02:33,600
It's the meridians.

48
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:37,200
Did you cure His Highness's injury?

49
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:39,000
So what?

50
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:40,680
I think the flower-tooth-picking stone

51
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:41,880
also found that his illness

52
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:43,120
was in the lung.

53
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:45,240
His Highness is hiding many secrets

54
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:46,840
that he doesn't want to talk to others.

55
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:48,160
I can't ask him.

56
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:50,320
But his poison has been deep.

57
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:52,040
If he meets a rare moment,

58
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:54,280
please cure him in time.

59
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:57,160
The spiritual power in the flower-tooth stone

60
00:02:57,400 --> 00:02:58,360
only needs to be ingested

61
00:02:58,360 --> 00:02:59,920
into His Highness's meridians

62
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:01,160
and automatically circulate

63
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:02,720
to suppress the poison of the lung.

64
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:05,560
Where did I get the spiritual power?

65
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:07,640
How to ingest it?

66
00:03:07,640 --> 00:03:08,280
No.

67
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:15,240
Is it coming so fast?

68
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:26,320
It's dangerous.

69
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:33,400
It's dangerous. Go.

70
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:39,200
Go.

71
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:48,840
You, can you run again?

72
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:50,400
It's dangerous.

73
00:03:58,920 --> 00:04:00,280
In a twist,

74
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:01,720
it has connection to Consciousness.

75
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:02,680
You can survive without disruption.

76
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:05,640
If I really have the spiritual power,

77
00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:06,640
I've made up my mind.

78
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:13,480
Leave me alone!

79
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:20,080
There's an assassin!

80
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:21,120
Don't run!

81
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:22,600
Go after him!

82
00:05:05,640 --> 00:05:06,840
What's going on?

83
00:05:09,080 --> 00:05:10,120
Are you hurt?

84
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:13,960
What happened just now?

85
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:15,880
We ran too fast and didn't catch up.

86
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:17,080
We only left this.

87
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:26,680
It's not me!

88
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:27,880
I know.

89
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,520
This token is the prince's surname.

90
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:31,880
It belongs to him.

91
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:36,480
So,

92
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:38,280
the wound on your body...

93
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:39,600
This is the palace.

94
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:41,880
It's not as normal as others.

95
00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:43,200
Wound?

96
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:44,920
He's targeting you again?

97
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:45,960
Brother,

98
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:47,600
why didn't you tell me?

99
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:49,000
It's just a minor wound.

100
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:51,440
Taoist Hua has cured it for me.

101
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:53,280
Don't worry.

102
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:55,320
It's not a trivial matter.

103
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:56,120
Alright.

104
00:05:56,280 --> 00:05:57,240
It's getting late.

105
00:05:57,520 --> 00:05:59,040
You should go back and rest.

106
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:00,000
Wait.

107
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:02,480
Since you and the prince

108
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:04,320
are already in a state of immortality,

109
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:06,600
things like this won't happen again.

110
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:12,040
Don't worry.

111
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:14,400
I'll try my best

112
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:15,840
to protect Taoist Hua.

113
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:32,720
Useless!

114
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:33,880
Yes.

115
00:06:35,320 --> 00:06:36,120
How much longer

116
00:06:36,280 --> 00:06:37,560
will you take

117
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:38,680
to think it through?

118
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:43,320
Why are you so stubborn?

119
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:54,560
You misunderstood me.

120
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:56,440
I'm not interested

121
00:06:57,280 --> 00:06:58,480
in gold and silver.

122
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:07,160
What you really care about

123
00:07:07,320 --> 00:07:08,720
is the way of the heavens.

124
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:11,320
You can buy all these information.

125
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:13,120
As long as you can help me

126
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:24,520
get rid of that

127
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:25,400
Taoist.

128
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:28,080
I've tested the one

129
00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:29,880
who's with the Sixth Prince.

130
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,080
His spiritual power is far above mine.

131
00:07:33,640 --> 00:07:34,840
I'm afraid

132
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:38,280
I'm too weak.

133
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:42,120
Don't worry, Mr. State Preceptor.

134
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:44,320
I can get rid of

135
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:45,520
all the useless things.

136
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:47,120
What's more, Mr. State Preceptor.

137
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:50,240
I'll give you one last chance.

138
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:51,720
Don't let Mr. State Preceptor

139
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:53,040
laugh at me.

140
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:53,920
I understand.

141
00:07:57,680 --> 00:07:58,560
And so much spiritual power

142
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:00,120
is wasted on a useless thing.

143
00:08:00,760 --> 00:08:01,720
It's a waste.

144
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:02,960
If you can

145
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:04,280
use it as your weapon,

146
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:06,680
it'll be a great help.

147
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:08,600
Maybe the spiritual power of Haileng

148
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:11,440
can help you.

149
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:22,360
You're well-prepared.

150
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:25,680
I admire you.

151
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:32,640
I comedian dies.

152
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:33,800
I may know

153
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,900
who you are.

154
00:08:36,520 --> 00:08:37,520
Heir Apparent,

155
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:39,280
is everything all right?

156
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,040
No, Father.

157
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:48,160
What's wrong?

158
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:53,960
Father,

159
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:56,160
why are you asking me outshled so late?

160
00:08:56,760 --> 00:08:58,400
I'm told that

161
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:00,740
Rong'er sent something

162
00:09:00,740 --> 00:09:02,740
I will find a way to

163
00:09:02,740 --> 00:09:03,740
reconcile with my brother.

164
00:09:04,740 --> 00:09:05,740
You should rest.

165
00:09:11,740 --> 00:09:12,740
Brother.

166
00:09:13,740 --> 00:09:14,740
What's wrong?

167
00:09:17,740 --> 00:09:19,740
Don't mention the incident

168
00:09:19,740 --> 00:09:20,740
of me and the flower medicine master

169
00:09:20,740 --> 00:09:21,740
to anyone tonight.

170
00:09:22,740 --> 00:09:23,740
Tomorrow is the single-medicine meeting.

171
00:09:24,740 --> 00:09:25,740
I won't compete with Ye Rong

172
00:09:25,740 --> 00:09:26,740
at the meeting.

173
00:09:27,740 --> 00:09:29,740
It's more important to cure my father.

174
00:09:30,740 --> 00:09:31,740
I found a way

175
00:09:31,740 --> 00:09:32,740
at the drug store today.

176
00:09:32,740 --> 00:09:33,740
The flower medicine master

177
00:09:33,740 --> 00:09:34,740
will do it personally.

178
00:09:35,740 --> 00:09:36,740
Tomorrow,

179
00:09:36,740 --> 00:09:37,740
he will tell you

180
00:09:37,740 --> 00:09:38,740
what to do.

181
00:09:38,740 --> 00:09:39,740
I got it.

182
00:09:40,740 --> 00:09:41,740
The flower medicine master

183
00:09:41,740 --> 00:09:42,740
can cure the disease.

184
00:09:44,740 --> 00:09:45,740
His sister, Hua Rong Yue,

185
00:09:45,740 --> 00:09:46,740
is also good at it.

186
00:09:48,740 --> 00:09:49,740
With them two around,

187
00:09:49,740 --> 00:09:50,740
I can feel relieved.

188
00:09:51,740 --> 00:09:52,740
Brother,

189
00:09:52,740 --> 00:09:53,740
what do you want to say?

190
00:09:54,740 --> 00:09:55,740
I feel...

191
00:09:55,740 --> 00:09:56,740
Ye Xu,

192
00:09:57,740 --> 00:09:58,740
you always act

193
00:09:58,740 --> 00:09:59,740
in a rash way.

194
00:09:59,740 --> 00:10:00,740
You should think about

195
00:10:00,740 --> 00:10:01,740
what you should do.

196
00:10:02,740 --> 00:10:03,740
You should think

197
00:10:03,740 --> 00:10:04,740
about what you should do

198
00:10:05,740 --> 00:10:06,740
in the future.

199
00:10:16,740 --> 00:10:17,740
Why are you here?

200
00:10:18,740 --> 00:10:19,740
I'm here

201
00:10:19,740 --> 00:10:21,740
to ask you a favor.

202
00:10:24,740 --> 00:10:25,740
What is it?

203
00:10:26,740 --> 00:10:27,740
I always feel

204
00:10:27,740 --> 00:10:28,740
that you are hiding something from me.

205
00:10:28,740 --> 00:10:29,740
It's very likely

206
00:10:29,740 --> 00:10:30,740
that it's something very important

207
00:10:30,740 --> 00:10:31,740
and dangerous.

208
00:10:33,740 --> 00:10:34,740
I'm worried that

209
00:10:35,740 --> 00:10:36,740
Ye Rong will take the wrong path

210
00:10:36,740 --> 00:10:38,740
to fight against the eldest prince.

211
00:10:39,740 --> 00:10:40,740
It's too hard to win the first place.

212
00:10:41,740 --> 00:10:42,740
Once I face

213
00:10:42,740 --> 00:10:43,740
Ye Rong,

214
00:10:43,740 --> 00:10:44,740
I'll be more worried

215
00:10:44,740 --> 00:10:45,740
about my brother's safety.

216
00:10:46,740 --> 00:10:47,740
No.

217
00:10:47,740 --> 00:10:48,740
Ye Tian asked me

218
00:10:48,740 --> 00:10:49,740
not to attend

219
00:10:49,740 --> 00:10:50,740
the meeting tomorrow

220
00:10:50,740 --> 00:10:51,740
to avoid getting angry

221
00:10:51,740 --> 00:10:52,740
at the eldest prince.

222
00:10:52,740 --> 00:10:53,740
It's too nervous.

223
00:10:54,740 --> 00:10:55,740
I know he looked for you.

224
00:10:56,740 --> 00:10:57,740
What else did he say?

225
00:10:58,740 --> 00:10:59,740
He asked me to take you

226
00:10:59,740 --> 00:11:00,740
to the palace to find the antidote tomorrow.

227
00:11:01,740 --> 00:11:03,740
I guess he wants me

228
00:11:03,740 --> 00:11:05,740
to find another natural flower.

229
00:11:06,740 --> 00:11:07,740
Something is wrong.

230
00:11:07,740 --> 00:11:08,740
Don't listen to him.

231
00:11:09,740 --> 00:11:10,740
There must be a problem

232
00:11:10,740 --> 00:11:11,740
with the pill meeting tomorrow.

233
00:11:11,740 --> 00:11:12,740
Hua Yaoshi,

234
00:11:12,740 --> 00:11:13,740
you have a strong spiritual power.

235
00:11:13,740 --> 00:11:14,740
Tonight is the second time

236
00:11:14,740 --> 00:11:15,740
you saved my brother.

237
00:11:16,740 --> 00:11:17,740
I beg you.

238
00:11:17,740 --> 00:11:18,740
Attend the pill meeting tomorrow

239
00:11:18,740 --> 00:11:19,740
as usual

240
00:11:20,740 --> 00:11:21,740
to protect my brother.

241
00:11:22,740 --> 00:11:23,740
The current Ye Dynasty

242
00:11:23,740 --> 00:11:24,740
can be a stronghold

243
00:11:24,740 --> 00:11:25,740
and rely on

244
00:11:25,740 --> 00:11:26,740
the constant killing of people.

245
00:11:26,740 --> 00:11:27,740
In the past,

246
00:11:27,740 --> 00:11:28,740
my mother

247
00:11:28,740 --> 00:11:29,740
was a princess

248
00:11:29,740 --> 00:11:30,740
of a foreign country.

249
00:11:31,740 --> 00:11:32,740
After the Gu State was destroyed,

250
00:11:33,740 --> 00:11:34,740
my mother

251
00:11:35,740 --> 00:11:36,740
was made a concubine

252
00:11:37,740 --> 00:11:38,740
and gave birth to my brother and me.

253
00:11:39,740 --> 00:11:40,740
But we are foreigners.

254
00:11:41,740 --> 00:11:42,740
His Majesty was against

255
00:11:42,740 --> 00:11:43,740
the court's criticism

256
00:11:43,740 --> 00:11:44,740
and failed to stop

257
00:11:44,740 --> 00:11:45,740
the court's change

258
00:11:45,740 --> 00:11:46,740
that forced my mother to die.

259
00:11:46,740 --> 00:11:47,740
Since then,

260
00:11:48,740 --> 00:11:49,740
the eldest prince Ye Rong

261
00:11:49,740 --> 00:11:50,740
has been targeting my brother.

262
00:11:52,740 --> 00:11:53,740
When I was young,

263
00:11:53,740 --> 00:11:54,740
my brother and I

264
00:11:54,740 --> 00:11:55,740
couldn't stop my mother from dying.

265
00:11:56,740 --> 00:11:57,740
Today,

266
00:11:57,740 --> 00:11:58,740
I can't just

267
00:11:58,740 --> 00:11:59,740
watch my brother

268
00:11:59,740 --> 00:12:00,740
and go to the Ministry of Revenue.

269
00:12:02,740 --> 00:12:03,740
If you want to live,

270
00:12:04,740 --> 00:12:06,740
don't help His Majesty.

271
00:12:08,740 --> 00:12:10,740
I'll think about it.

272
00:12:11,740 --> 00:12:12,740
Please.

273
00:12:56,740 --> 00:12:57,740
Your Majesty.

274
00:12:57,740 --> 00:12:58,740
I'm sorry.

275
00:12:58,740 --> 00:12:59,740
I'm sorry.

276
00:12:59,740 --> 00:13:00,740
I'm sorry.

277
00:13:00,740 --> 00:13:01,740
I'm sorry.

278
00:13:01,740 --> 00:13:02,740
I'm sorry.

279
00:13:02,740 --> 00:13:03,740
I'm sorry.

280
00:13:03,740 --> 00:13:04,740
I'm sorry.

281
00:13:04,740 --> 00:13:05,740
I'm sorry.

282
00:13:05,740 --> 00:13:06,740
I'm sorry.

283
00:13:06,740 --> 00:13:07,740
I'm sorry.

284
00:13:07,740 --> 00:13:08,740
I'm sorry.

285
00:13:08,740 --> 00:13:09,740
I'm sorry.

286
00:13:09,740 --> 00:13:10,740
I'm sorry.

287
00:13:10,740 --> 00:13:11,740
I'm sorry.

288
00:13:11,740 --> 00:13:12,740
I'm sorry.

289
00:13:12,740 --> 00:13:13,740
I'm sorry.

290
00:13:13,740 --> 00:13:14,740
I'm sorry.

291
00:13:14,740 --> 00:13:15,740
I'm sorry.

292
00:13:15,740 --> 00:13:16,740
I'm sorry.

293
00:13:16,740 --> 00:13:17,740
I'm sorry.

294
00:13:17,740 --> 00:13:18,740
I'm sorry.

295
00:13:18,740 --> 00:13:19,740
I'm sorry.

296
00:13:19,740 --> 00:13:20,740
I'm sorry.

297
00:13:20,740 --> 00:13:21,740
I'm sorry.

298
00:13:21,740 --> 00:13:22,740
I'm sorry.

299
00:13:22,740 --> 00:13:23,740
I'm sorry.

300
00:13:23,740 --> 00:13:24,740
I'm sorry.

301
00:13:24,740 --> 00:13:25,740
I'm sorry.

302
00:13:25,740 --> 00:13:26,740
I'm sorry.

303
00:13:26,740 --> 00:13:27,740
I'm sorry.

304
00:13:27,740 --> 00:13:28,740
I'm sorry.

305
00:13:28,740 --> 00:13:29,740
I'm sorry.

306
00:13:29,740 --> 00:13:30,740
I'm sorry.

307
00:13:30,740 --> 00:13:31,740
I'm sorry.

308
00:13:31,740 --> 00:13:32,740
I'm sorry.

309
00:13:32,740 --> 00:13:33,740
I'm sorry.

310
00:13:33,740 --> 00:13:34,740
I'm sorry.

311
00:13:34,740 --> 00:13:35,740
I'm sorry.

312
00:13:35,740 --> 00:13:36,740
I'm sorry.

313
00:13:36,740 --> 00:13:37,740
I'm sorry.

314
00:13:37,740 --> 00:13:38,740
I'm sorry.

315
00:13:38,740 --> 00:13:39,740
I'm sorry.

316
00:13:39,740 --> 00:13:40,740
I'm sorry.

317
00:13:40,740 --> 00:13:41,740
I'm sorry.

318
00:13:41,740 --> 00:13:42,740
I'm sorry.

319
00:13:42,740 --> 00:13:43,740
I'm sorry.

320
00:13:43,740 --> 00:13:44,740
I'm sorry.

321
00:13:44,740 --> 00:13:45,740
I'm sorry.

322
00:13:45,740 --> 00:13:46,740
I'm sorry.

323
00:13:46,740 --> 00:13:47,740
I'm sorry.

324
00:13:47,740 --> 00:13:48,740
I'm sorry.

325
00:13:48,740 --> 00:13:49,740
I'm sorry.

326
00:13:49,740 --> 00:13:50,740
I'm sorry.

327
00:13:50,740 --> 00:13:51,740
I'm sorry.

328
00:13:51,740 --> 00:13:52,740
I'm sorry.

329
00:13:52,740 --> 00:13:53,740
I'm sorry.

330
00:13:53,740 --> 00:13:54,740
I'm sorry.
