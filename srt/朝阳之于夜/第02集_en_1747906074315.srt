1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,200
Your Majesty coronel is back

2
00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:33,120
Cherish the beauty

3
00:00:33,160 --> 00:00:36,720
Drank my eso

4
00:00:36,720 --> 00:00:38,560
Your Majesty coronel is back

5
00:00:40,360 --> 00:00:42,960
Demon Out of Chang An

6
00:00:45,040 --> 00:00:55,140
Don't tell the

7
00:00:55,140 --> 00:00:55,940
Buyers

8
00:00:56,840 --> 00:00:58,040
Those who do not believe the tale

9
00:00:58,840 --> 00:00:59,640
There is no invalid

10
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,080
If the water in the pot is wasted,

11
00:01:01,240 --> 00:01:02,040
it will be useless.

12
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:03,040
The waste of the house?

13
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:03,880
What did she

14
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:06,040
say about the flowers?

15
00:01:06,680 --> 00:01:08,160
It's an external injury.

16
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:10,240
Why would it hurt the waste of the house?

17
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:12,880
I don't know either.

18
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:14,200
Her life is in danger.

19
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:16,320
She's dead.

20
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:17,880
What?

21
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:19,760
How can that be?

22
00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:20,360
This...

23
00:01:23,240 --> 00:01:24,080
There's another thing.

24
00:01:25,440 --> 00:01:27,520
The Heavenly Flower and the Spiritual Qi of the Heavenly Emperor

25
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,520
are the purest of all.

26
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,320
If the legend is true,

27
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,000
we can save her.

28
00:01:34,480 --> 00:01:35,120
Zhao Yang,

29
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:36,480
you're willing to do it?

30
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:37,800
No matter what,

31
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:39,760
life is the most important thing.

32
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:51,360
Your Highness,

33
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:54,120
Ye Tian did go to the pharmacy.

34
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:55,960
He seems to be being treated.

35
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:56,960
I see.

36
00:01:57,520 --> 00:01:58,160
Your Highness,

37
00:01:58,720 --> 00:02:00,280
Ye Tian is so weak.

38
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:02,400
Do we really have to keep an eye on him?

39
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:03,880
I'm standing here

40
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,760
because I'm worried about no one.

41
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:31,520
My injury has healed.

42
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:33,880
Heavenly Flower.

43
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:41,880
Heavenly Flower.

44
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:45,560
My Heavenly Flower is so precious.

45
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:49,760
Heavenly Flower?

46
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:56,120
Heavenly Flower.

47
00:02:58,160 --> 00:02:58,800
Your Highness.

48
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:13,880
Dead eyebrow.

49
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:18,320
Your Highness.

50
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:20,240
Your Highness.

51
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:22,240
I have an fortune.

52
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:23,360
Why do you need to lie?

53
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:26,800
world autotに

54
00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:27,920
If she knew about its origin

55
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:28,680
It's weird.

56
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:30,360
It's like

57
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:32,280
the story of Heaven and Xiuluo.

58
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:34,680
It's just a scene from the novel.

59
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:36,440
Do you believe it?

60
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:38,520
You don't?

61
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:44,280
If there's really a Heaven in this world,

62
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:46,040
it's because the Heavens are lazy to punish the world.

63
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:47,400
So they don't appear.

64
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:49,080
It's all right.

65
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:50,960
But what about Xiuluo?

66
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:53,480
If there's really a Heaven in this world,

67
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:55,160
why didn't Xiuluo

68
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:57,400
appear in the mortal world as a woman?

69
00:03:57,960 --> 00:03:59,080
We both know that

70
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:00,560
it doesn't matter

71
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:01,760
if it's true or not.

72
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:02,880
Besides,

73
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:04,160
His Majesty...

74
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:07,200
I know

75
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:08,280
His Majesty's condition.

76
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:10,040
Now the princes

77
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:12,480
are competing for the last position.

78
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:15,080
Brother, you don't want to find the antidote to fix the world.

79
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:17,360
Instead, you're studying these poisons here.

80
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:20,360
Poison and medicine are two different things.

81
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:21,920
From the poisons,

82
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,480
we may find the remedy to save father.

83
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:26,440
Besides,

84
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:28,700
even the world's No.1

85
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:31,160
can't cure father's illness.

86
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:33,520
What's the use of

87
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,320
asking for some help?

88
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:37,840
Fine.

89
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:40,840
It's up to you.

90
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:42,120
I'll listen to you.

91
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:45,720
Brother,

92
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:47,280
are we really not going to

93
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:48,840
prepare His Majesty's poisons?

94
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:51,840
Don't worry.

95
00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:54,800
I have my own plans.

96
00:04:56,760 --> 00:04:57,320
Okay.

97
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:08,040
Okay, I'll leave first.

98
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:22,840
Sir,

99
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:24,480
what were you talking about?

100
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:27,400
Listen,

101
00:05:27,640 --> 00:05:29,080
he's unreliable.

102
00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:30,560
After I saved him last time,

103
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:31,760
he left without a word.

104
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:33,000
I didn't get a penny.

105
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,280
I'm so rich.

106
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:35,440
From now on,

107
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:36,640
your business

108
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:38,160
has nothing to do with me.

109
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:39,640
What do you mean?

110
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:40,480
Your account book

111
00:05:40,760 --> 00:05:43,040
has been cleared by that gentleman.

112
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:45,000
And I gave him our contract.

113
00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:45,960
You have to listen to him

114
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:47,320
no matter what you do.

115
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:48,720
Wait.

116
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:50,680
You gave him my three-year contract?

117
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:51,440
That's not good.

118
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:53,160
What if his food is not good?

119
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:55,560
But he gave me money.

120
00:05:55,880 --> 00:05:56,480
Besides,

121
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:57,400
I can't afford

122
00:05:57,640 --> 00:05:58,960
your food.

123
00:05:59,080 --> 00:05:59,880
Wait, then...

124
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:00,400
Enough.

125
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:01,160
Go. Go. Go.

126
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:12,760
Thank you for saving me.

127
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,600
Is that how you thank me?

128
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:18,600
Is there a problem?

129
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:21,720
It's my choice

130
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:23,040
to save you with a flower.

131
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:23,920
But it doesn't mean

132
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:24,440
you can treat me

133
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:25,680
as an object

134
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:26,840
and buy it.

135
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:28,920
Then,

136
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:30,960
Miss Hua, I...

137
00:06:31,320 --> 00:06:32,160
What Miss Hua?

138
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:33,720
I'm a Taoist.

139
00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:35,720
Please call me Taoist Hua.

140
00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:40,040
Taoist Hua.

141
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:41,600
Then may I ask

142
00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:43,680
how I should repay you?

143
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:46,040
Give me this.

144
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:47,920
Taoist Hua.

145
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:51,280
I suggest you think about it.

146
00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:53,080
No, I won't.

147
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:54,200
I'll give you

148
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:57,200
three meals a day.

149
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:03,320
You'll be here for three years.

150
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:06,120
You'll be here for three months.

151
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:12,560
Deal.

152
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:21,400
Are you really a prince?

153
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:23,000
Brother.

154
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:25,720
Let's wait for the capitalist president's九州之icht.

155
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:34,160
Who are you two?

156
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:35,320
Ye Xun.

157
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:36,520
Don't get inspired.

158
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:38,520
I asked them tomy EU

159
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:41,360
for Father's Office.

160
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:43,000
European Such-as-Generation?

161
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:44,360
Brother.

162
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,120
Don't be fooled

163
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:47,200
by theseanya.

164
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:48,880
I'm not a fraud.

165
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:50,320
Your brother was saved

166
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:51,560
by my beauty and mighty Sirius.

167
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:53,000
Beauty and mighty Sirius?

168
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,280
I've told my servants

169
00:07:54,280 --> 00:07:55,680
to prepare a bedroom for you.

170
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:57,240
You should take a rest.

171
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:05,920
Brother,

172
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:08,600
this is your plan?

173
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:26,240
It's a nice night.

174
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:30,040
They serve me well.

175
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:33,640
And they let me live in such a big place.

176
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:36,480
If I knew it, I would have come earlier.

177
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:38,360
I wouldn't care about his three wishes.

178
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:56,080
Where did this jade pendant come from?

179
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:26,280
Special Enchantment.

180
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:39,040
It's quite dangerous.

181
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:42,200
Is it the right way to attack the Sixth Prince?

182
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:47,920
I should devise a good turnaround

183
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:49,720
using this Jade tiger attire.

184
00:09:52,040 --> 00:09:52,800
Huayou stone

185
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:53,640
Good job.

186
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:55,280
Follow him.

187
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:56,560
No way.

188
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:07,240
I have a promotion.

189
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:09,320
A promotion for me?

190
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:10,720
A promotion for mariage?

191
00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:18,800
Huo Xiaoshi, I have something to ask.

192
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:58,640
The sound of the flute is like the sound of the flute

193
00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:03,640
The sound of the flute is like the sound of the flute

194
00:11:03,640 --> 00:11:08,640
The sound of the flute is like the sound of the flute

195
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:13,640
The sound of the flute is like the sound of the flute

196
00:11:13,640 --> 00:11:18,640
The sound of the flute is like the sound of the flute

197
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:22,640
I'm still in the desert, but I'm still free

198
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:26,640
I ask myself if I can go back

199
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:31,640
I don't care about the past, I don't care about the future

200
00:11:31,640 --> 00:11:35,640
I swear to go back to the end of time

201
00:11:35,640 --> 00:11:39,640
I dare to dream with the sky

202
00:11:39,640 --> 00:11:45,640
I just want to keep this fate
