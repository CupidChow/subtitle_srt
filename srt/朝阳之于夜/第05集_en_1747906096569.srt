1
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,440
Allow me cook for you, legislative official.

2
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:07,860
It is the time.

3
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:10,200
Please take a look

4
00:01:10,380 --> 00:01:11,440
to remove their joining of the emperor.

5
00:01:11,740 --> 00:01:12,520
coefficients.

6
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:17,640
I heard 6th brother

7
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:18,480
has found an ex multitasking

8
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:19,520
military diver.

9
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:21,120
Only 6th brother

10
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:22,240
has brought him here here.

11
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:22,980
It could be

12
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:24,320
6th brother

13
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:25,760
doesn't want to shoulder his burdens for Father.

14
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,960
is just a key master of the pugilistic world.

15
00:01:32,120 --> 00:01:33,080
His ability

16
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:34,920
is not comparable to those of you here.

17
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:36,360
It's because Sixth Brother is incompetent

18
00:01:36,760 --> 00:01:38,680
and can't share his burden with Father.

19
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:42,320
What about your brother?

20
00:01:42,520 --> 00:01:44,400
He's not going to attend

21
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:45,840
such an important event of the Pill Society?

22
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:48,400
Xuan'er is not yet to be promoted.

23
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:49,720
She has no name.

24
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,760
How can she appear in such a place?

25
00:01:52,160 --> 00:01:53,080
That's right.

26
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:55,040
She's indeed a troublemaker.

27
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:57,280
You two brothers are very interesting.

28
00:01:57,720 --> 00:01:59,480
The Pill Society has been planning for a long time.

29
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:01,720
Your brother is not qualified to attend the event.

30
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,000
As a brother,

31
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:05,440
he can't bring a key master of the Pill Society.

32
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:06,960
It's a shame

33
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:07,960
that he's lost

34
00:02:07,960 --> 00:02:09,480
the honor of the Ye Dynasty.

35
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:11,560
The eldest son of the Chu Army of the Ye Dynasty

36
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:13,480
is very harsh and ruthless.

37
00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:15,440
He doesn't have any honor

38
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:16,560
for His Majesty.

39
00:02:29,480 --> 00:02:32,000
Please give Father the flower key.

40
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:35,080
I've been picking herbs in the mountains for many years.

41
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:36,480
I'm planning to sell them in the pharmacy.

42
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:37,920
I'll do my best.

43
00:03:29,480 --> 00:03:30,280
Your Highness!

44
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:32,120
Put down my sword right now!

45
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:34,160
How could you do this to me?

46
00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:37,880
Let me clean up this.

47
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:50,060
Your Majesty!

48
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:55,700
Father.

49
00:03:55,700 --> 00:03:56,700
How dare you

50
00:03:56,700 --> 00:03:57,500
kill my father

51
00:03:57,500 --> 00:03:58,700
in the middle of the night?

52
00:03:59,100 --> 00:04:00,180
You're lying!

53
00:04:00,380 --> 00:04:01,060
Guards!

54
00:04:01,180 --> 00:04:02,660
Arrest these rebels.

55
00:04:02,660 --> 00:04:03,380
Yes!

56
00:04:17,740 --> 00:04:18,660
Your Excellency,

57
00:04:19,060 --> 00:04:20,380
please ask Qin Chen Xiu

58
00:04:20,380 --> 00:04:21,300
out.

59
00:04:21,780 --> 00:04:22,300
And

60
00:04:23,060 --> 00:04:24,700
arrest his brother Ye Xun

61
00:04:24,780 --> 00:04:26,420
personally.

62
00:04:30,740 --> 00:04:31,620
Your Highness,

63
00:04:32,020 --> 00:04:33,700
I've brought Ye Xun here.

64
00:04:34,140 --> 00:04:34,740
Hold on.

65
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:36,140
Ye Rong,

66
00:04:36,820 --> 00:04:38,500
Father hasn't told you, right?

67
00:04:39,700 --> 00:04:40,940
The copper mine in Shanyang,

68
00:04:41,300 --> 00:04:42,700
the military armory in Beiju,

69
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:45,140
and the political pulse of other states

70
00:04:45,580 --> 00:04:46,220
are all recorded

71
00:04:46,220 --> 00:04:47,620
in the secret edict given by Father.

72
00:04:48,380 --> 00:04:49,580
If you want to know,

73
00:04:49,700 --> 00:04:51,220
I can tell you everything.

74
00:04:52,220 --> 00:04:53,580
But I have a condition.

75
00:04:54,140 --> 00:04:55,420
I'll go get the secret edict

76
00:04:55,900 --> 00:04:57,020
and let them go.

77
00:05:09,220 --> 00:05:11,340
Then let them take you there.

78
00:05:18,300 --> 00:05:19,580
You can trust me

79
00:05:20,380 --> 00:05:21,540
if you have the national treasure.

80
00:05:24,260 --> 00:05:24,740
Okay.

81
00:05:25,780 --> 00:05:26,580
Ye Xia'ai,

82
00:05:26,980 --> 00:05:28,700
itédr event report of the attack.

83
00:05:29,460 --> 00:05:30,260
I'd like to do that.

84
00:05:33,020 --> 00:05:33,740
In that case,

85
00:05:34,420 --> 00:05:36,700
so long as you respect me,

86
00:05:37,140 --> 00:05:38,420
I'll give you just that.

87
00:05:41,940 --> 00:05:43,060
Tell me,

88
00:05:46,660 --> 00:05:47,860
if you want to kill him

89
00:05:48,060 --> 00:05:49,260
first,

90
00:05:50,300 --> 00:05:51,580
I'll Еще don't say it.

91
00:05:51,580 --> 00:05:52,980
Jiulingsi focused

92
00:05:53,420 --> 00:06:04,160
more on

93
00:06:06,180 --> 00:06:09,380
the

94
00:06:11,300 --> 00:06:19,780
red

95
00:06:19,780 --> 00:06:20,540
Right?

96
00:06:43,940 --> 00:06:46,100
Where is the secret edict from Ye Tian?

97
00:06:46,620 --> 00:06:47,500
I don't know.

98
00:06:47,620 --> 00:06:48,700
Brother never mentioned

99
00:06:48,700 --> 00:06:49,940
anything about the secret edict.

100
00:06:50,260 --> 00:06:51,820
I knew something would happen today.

101
00:06:52,100 --> 00:06:52,940
But I didn't expect...

102
00:06:54,700 --> 00:06:56,500
What if there is no secret edict?

103
00:06:57,300 --> 00:06:59,380
Ye Tian arranged me to take you out of the palace.

104
00:06:59,860 --> 00:07:01,500
Did he ask you to bring something?

105
00:07:02,260 --> 00:07:03,820
Bring something?

106
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:19,620
He mentioned that

107
00:07:19,820 --> 00:07:21,820
I should bring the letter he wrote

108
00:07:21,820 --> 00:07:22,180
to read with you.

109
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:24,260
It's said that Lu Tusheng and Hua Youshi

110
00:07:24,260 --> 00:07:25,180
are reading it together.

111
00:07:36,380 --> 00:07:38,140
I forgive you for hiding it from me again.

112
00:07:39,540 --> 00:07:40,980
When you read this letter,

113
00:07:41,140 --> 00:07:42,860
you will understand my long-term intention.

114
00:07:43,780 --> 00:07:44,460
Maybe

115
00:07:45,140 --> 00:07:47,020
I have been protecting you all the time.

116
00:07:47,820 --> 00:07:48,780
It's not difficult.

117
00:07:49,460 --> 00:07:50,700
It's hard to take revenge.

118
00:07:51,980 --> 00:07:54,260
Do you remember how our mother died?

119
00:07:54,940 --> 00:07:56,860
Father is the one who took the blame.

120
00:07:57,700 --> 00:07:59,260
When the officials criticized mother,

121
00:07:59,460 --> 00:08:00,780
father did nothing.

122
00:08:01,260 --> 00:08:02,460
It's not a coincidence.

123
00:08:04,020 --> 00:08:05,060
Ye Rong has never been

124
00:08:05,060 --> 00:08:06,740
my target since the beginning.

125
00:08:07,220 --> 00:08:08,660
Father forced mother to die.

126
00:08:09,020 --> 00:08:11,660
He had to pay the price.

127
00:08:12,900 --> 00:08:13,980
These days,

128
00:08:14,260 --> 00:08:16,580
I've been suffering from the poison of the thousand-heart eye.

129
00:08:17,060 --> 00:08:18,980
I even tried to kill Xiao Yong

130
00:08:18,980 --> 00:08:20,060
to confirm the plan.

131
00:08:21,260 --> 00:08:22,420
I can finally recognize him

132
00:08:22,860 --> 00:08:24,460
at the elixir meeting tomorrow.

133
00:08:25,220 --> 00:08:26,300
I've been thinking about it again.

134
00:08:26,460 --> 00:08:28,500
I don't want you and Hua Youshi to be involved.

135
00:08:29,260 --> 00:08:30,900
I can't get out of the palace alive.

136
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:34,220
You guys can live freely.

137
00:08:41,260 --> 00:08:41,860
Do it.

138
00:08:42,140 --> 00:08:42,860
Wait.

139
00:08:46,940 --> 00:08:48,060
You're here, State Preceptor.

140
00:08:48,580 --> 00:08:49,180
What?

141
00:08:49,660 --> 00:08:50,700
You knew I would come?

142
00:08:51,220 --> 00:08:52,580
His Highness ordered me

143
00:08:52,740 --> 00:08:54,820
to let you take care of the woman's life.

144
00:08:58,900 --> 00:09:00,380
Then I hope you

145
00:09:00,820 --> 00:09:02,700
can thank His Highness for me.

146
00:09:16,580 --> 00:09:17,900
I'm here to pick you up.

147
00:09:18,340 --> 00:09:20,540
His Highness thought I was in his camp.

148
00:09:21,140 --> 00:09:22,380
How is Ye Tian?

149
00:09:22,700 --> 00:09:23,700
Is he in danger?

150
00:09:25,060 --> 00:09:25,820
Dangerous?

151
00:09:26,380 --> 00:09:27,740
The real danger

152
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:29,460
is His Highness Ye Rong.

153
00:09:29,860 --> 00:09:30,780
What do you mean?

154
00:09:32,100 --> 00:09:35,340
The reason why I came to the palace

155
00:09:35,340 --> 00:09:38,500
is to monitor the birth of Xiuluo.

156
00:09:38,660 --> 00:09:39,580
And Ye Tian

157
00:09:39,740 --> 00:09:41,340
might be that Xiuluo.

158
00:09:41,940 --> 00:09:42,740
I'm afraid

159
00:09:42,740 --> 00:09:44,820
he's not the one who can monitor Xiuluo.

160
00:09:44,860 --> 00:09:46,460
Maybe he's Xiuluo.

161
00:09:46,980 --> 00:09:48,220
From the earliest trauma

162
00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:49,580
to the later poison,

163
00:09:49,980 --> 00:09:51,620
it's all proof of my guess.

164
00:09:52,140 --> 00:09:53,500
Ye Tian is in a terrible state.

165
00:09:53,620 --> 00:09:54,660
He has a grudge in his heart.

166
00:09:55,100 --> 00:09:56,380
You should know it.

167
00:09:57,020 --> 00:09:58,300
But it was you, Hua Zhao Yang,

168
00:09:58,300 --> 00:09:59,420
who saved Ye Tianhou

169
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:00,820
and made me make a firm judgment.

170
00:10:01,460 --> 00:10:02,540
The medicine you used for him

171
00:10:02,940 --> 00:10:04,340
is the Heavenly Flower, right?

172
00:10:06,540 --> 00:10:07,540
The test report also shows

173
00:10:07,540 --> 00:10:09,500
that your spiritual power is far above mine.

174
00:10:10,380 --> 00:10:11,060
Hua Youshi,

175
00:10:11,660 --> 00:10:13,700
you have the powerful power of the Heavenly People in your body.

176
00:10:14,020 --> 00:10:15,700
This is the only evidence we have now.

177
00:10:16,260 --> 00:10:17,020
By then,

178
00:10:17,780 --> 00:10:18,900
we'll have to rely on you to get it.

179
00:10:19,380 --> 00:10:20,340
Stop hiding.

180
00:10:20,980 --> 00:10:22,060
Use your spiritual power.

181
00:10:22,820 --> 00:10:23,540
I...

182
00:10:24,340 --> 00:10:25,460
I can't use my spiritual power.

183
00:10:28,340 --> 00:10:29,380
Why not?

184
00:10:30,380 --> 00:10:31,300
I can't.

185
00:10:31,300 --> 00:10:32,260
The spiritual power comes from

186
00:10:32,260 --> 00:10:33,860
your little practice.

187
00:10:35,340 --> 00:10:36,420
How can you not?

188
00:10:42,140 --> 00:10:43,180
There's another possibility.

189
00:10:44,660 --> 00:10:46,060
You lost a memory.

190
00:10:46,700 --> 00:10:47,460
That's impossible.

191
00:10:47,820 --> 00:10:49,580
I've been inseparable from Zhao Yang since I was a child.

192
00:10:50,300 --> 00:10:51,740
He never has a memory loss problem.

193
00:10:52,100 --> 00:10:52,940
It's just that

194
00:10:53,220 --> 00:10:55,100
he's not good at practicing since he was a child.

195
00:10:56,060 --> 00:10:56,740
Wait.

196
00:10:56,900 --> 00:10:59,540
I really seem to have lost a memory.

197
00:11:00,300 --> 00:11:01,900
The night when Ye Tian was assassinated,

198
00:11:02,580 --> 00:11:04,900
I had some memories

199
00:11:05,020 --> 00:11:06,420
that didn't belong to me.

200
00:11:06,860 --> 00:11:08,140
How did it happen?

201
00:11:13,700 --> 00:11:42,120
Di Renosed from the Download King

202
00:11:43,700 --> 00:11:44,620
Can't you wait?

203
00:11:46,740 --> 00:11:47,820
Don't get me wrong.

204
00:11:48,460 --> 00:11:50,020
I'm not your brother.

205
00:11:51,700 --> 00:11:52,620
What do you mean?

206
00:11:52,900 --> 00:11:53,580
Prince,

207
00:11:54,420 --> 00:11:55,260
the imperial edict is ready.

208
00:11:58,740 --> 00:11:59,340
Look.

209
00:12:00,100 --> 00:12:02,100
With this imperial edict,

210
00:12:02,700 --> 00:12:05,300
I can be promoted to the throne immediately.

211
00:12:05,860 --> 00:12:06,540
Xie Tian,

212
00:12:07,060 --> 00:12:08,380
I have to thank you.

213
00:12:09,660 --> 00:12:10,660
You should know

214
00:12:10,660 --> 00:12:12,660
I've been sending people to keep an eye on you.

215
00:12:13,860 --> 00:12:14,620
Last night,

216
00:12:14,860 --> 00:12:16,220
my father summoned you to the palace.

217
00:12:16,700 --> 00:12:18,420
He knew I wanted to kill you

218
00:12:18,420 --> 00:12:20,140
to uphold justice for you.

219
00:12:20,420 --> 00:12:22,140
But that old man was confused.

220
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:23,780
He never thought

221
00:12:24,220 --> 00:12:26,020
the hand cream you gave him

222
00:12:26,020 --> 00:12:28,660
was the poison you had been planning to make.

223
00:12:28,940 --> 00:12:29,980
But you don't know

224
00:12:29,980 --> 00:12:31,220
I was the one who ordered the slaughter

225
00:12:31,220 --> 00:12:33,020
and forced your mother to die.

226
00:12:33,020 --> 00:12:34,260
This is the karma of the blood-shedding

227
00:12:34,260 --> 00:12:35,820
and the slander of the enemy.

228
00:12:37,660 --> 00:12:38,460
Ye Rong.

229
00:12:39,860 --> 00:12:41,060
You bastard.

230
00:12:41,540 --> 00:12:42,820
You will be punished by heaven.

231
00:12:43,700 --> 00:12:44,380
You...

232
00:12:50,140 --> 00:12:50,980
Listen.

233
00:12:51,380 --> 00:12:53,140
Your precious little Taoist

234
00:12:53,140 --> 00:12:54,460
and your precious brother

235
00:12:54,460 --> 00:12:55,460
were killed.

236
00:12:56,180 --> 00:12:57,740
You should be the one

237
00:12:57,740 --> 00:12:59,300
who killed them.

238
00:13:00,740 --> 00:13:01,740
Ye Rong.

239
00:13:02,580 --> 00:13:04,540
You bastard.

240
00:13:08,620 --> 00:13:09,420
Do you know

241
00:13:09,420 --> 00:13:10,900
how I lured the State Preceptor?

242
00:13:11,820 --> 00:13:12,820
I reminded him.

243
00:13:12,860 --> 00:13:15,180
But Hua Zhao Yang's spiritual power

244
00:13:15,180 --> 00:13:17,500
might help him break through the Heaven.

245
00:13:18,540 --> 00:13:19,940
So at this moment,

246
00:13:19,940 --> 00:13:20,860
he should have been

247
00:13:20,860 --> 00:13:22,580
caught by the State Preceptor.

248
00:13:23,060 --> 00:13:24,820
I wonder if it hurts

249
00:13:25,380 --> 00:13:26,660
if he gets sucked away by the spiritual power.

250
00:13:38,020 --> 00:13:39,420
You're sad.

251
00:13:41,300 --> 00:13:42,060
It's okay.

252
00:13:42,820 --> 00:13:44,780
You can go down there and stay with them soon.

253
00:15:12,820 --> 00:15:14,820
I'm afraid that I can't go down there.

254
00:15:14,820 --> 00:15:16,420
I'm afraid that I can't go down there.

255
00:15:16,420 --> 00:15:17,820
I'm afraid that I can't go down there.

256
00:15:17,820 --> 00:15:19,420
I'm afraid that I can't go down there.

257
00:15:19,420 --> 00:15:21,220
I'm afraid that I can't go down there.

258
00:15:21,220 --> 00:15:22,820
I'm afraid that I can't go down there.

259
00:15:22,820 --> 00:15:24,420
I'm afraid that I can't go down there.

260
00:15:24,420 --> 00:15:25,820
I'm afraid that I can't go down there.

261
00:15:25,820 --> 00:15:27,420
I'm afraid that I can't go down there.

262
00:15:27,420 --> 00:15:28,820
I'm afraid that I can't go down there.

263
00:15:28,820 --> 00:15:30,220
I'm afraid that I can't go down there.

264
00:15:30,220 --> 00:15:31,620
I'm afraid that I can't go down there.

265
00:15:31,620 --> 00:15:33,220
I'm afraid that I can't go down there.

266
00:15:33,220 --> 00:15:34,820
I'm afraid that I can't go down there.

267
00:15:34,820 --> 00:15:36,220
I'm afraid that I can't go down there.

268
00:15:36,220 --> 00:15:37,820
I'm afraid that I can't go down there.

269
00:15:37,820 --> 00:15:39,420
I'm afraid that I can't go down there.
