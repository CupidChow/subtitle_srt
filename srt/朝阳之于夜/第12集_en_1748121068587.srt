1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,800
Your brother has never had the ability to cure Xiu Luo Yi.

2
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:34,960
What nonsense are you talking about?

3
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:39,760
He didn't talk nonsense.

4
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:47,200
Since Xiu Luo Yi started,

5
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:49,240
he has been just taking the rice cake flower

6
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:51,120
and absorbing it into his body.

7
00:00:52,760 --> 00:00:53,640
What?

8
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:55,680
Is what he said true?

9
00:00:56,480 --> 00:00:57,760
I don't need to lie to you.

10
00:00:58,480 --> 00:00:59,400
I came here

11
00:01:00,040 --> 00:01:01,440
just to cure Xiu Luo.

12
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:04,080
As long as the problem of Xiu Luo is solved,

13
00:01:05,080 --> 00:01:06,080
then Xiu Luo Yi

14
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:08,120
will be cured.

15
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:14,520
I should

16
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,920
be the Xiu Luo that was about to happen.

17
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:21,240
Otherwise, why would I be able to absorb the rice cake flower?

18
00:01:30,760 --> 00:01:34,400
code

19
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:40,680
what should I do?

20
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:45,940
I'll reach the mountain

21
00:01:46,480 --> 00:01:49,040
and find your pot of rice cake flower,

22
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:52,240
I mean, my pot of rice cake flower?

23
00:01:53,240 --> 00:01:54,360
That was

24
00:01:54,660 --> 00:01:55,920
you have a Experimental Abyss!

25
00:01:56,040 --> 00:01:57,120
And never had been cast.

26
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:58,640
I'll figure this out.

27
00:01:59,480 --> 00:02:08,260
What is

28
00:02:09,020 --> 00:02:12,680
well worthishing like in the palace?

29
00:02:12,860 --> 00:02:15,140
Z Long left

30
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:18,160
the Zongs we were waiting for.

31
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:20,500
Why would you于

32
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:21,520
野花

33
00:02:21,880 --> 00:02:23,740
be the mistress ofries?

34
00:02:24,180 --> 00:02:26,020
Wh�se you

35
00:02:56,020 --> 00:02:59,180
Brother, please help me give you two a break.

36
00:02:59,180 --> 00:03:00,420
Brother Когда...

37
00:03:00,460 --> 00:03:02,420
I was going to give you a hint.

38
00:03:14,100 --> 00:03:17,900
So which flower actually belongs to Ye Tian?

39
00:03:21,460 --> 00:03:22,780
Is that you?

40
00:03:26,020 --> 00:03:27,020
I'm waiting for you

41
00:03:27,020 --> 00:03:28,020
for a thousand years,

42
00:03:29,020 --> 00:03:31,020
in the endless sea of ​​waves.

43
00:03:33,020 --> 00:03:35,020
I'm waiting for you.

44
00:03:40,020 --> 00:03:41,020
What's your name?

45
00:03:42,020 --> 00:03:43,020
I'm waiting for you.

46
00:03:44,020 --> 00:03:45,020
I'm waiting for you.

47
00:03:46,020 --> 00:03:47,020
I'm waiting for you.

48
00:03:50,020 --> 00:03:51,020
I'm waiting for you.

49
00:03:54,020 --> 00:03:55,020
I'm waiting for you.

50
00:03:57,020 --> 00:03:58,020
I'm waiting for you.

51
00:04:22,020 --> 00:04:24,020
Why did you appear in this sea of ​​waves?

52
00:04:27,020 --> 00:04:31,020
The name of the beautiful sea of ​​waves.

53
00:04:33,020 --> 00:04:37,020
Are you the only one who planted these flowers?

54
00:04:41,020 --> 00:04:43,020
It's a natural growth.

55
00:04:44,020 --> 00:04:47,020
At first, there was only a spiritual pillar here.

56
00:04:48,020 --> 00:04:52,020
Until now, it has become a endless sea of ​​waves.

57
00:04:57,020 --> 00:04:58,020
Their desire is strong.

58
00:05:00,020 --> 00:05:01,020
It's the same as me.

59
00:05:04,020 --> 00:05:07,020
Are you the natural in my heart?

60
00:05:08,020 --> 00:05:09,020
Am I waiting for you?

61
00:05:12,020 --> 00:05:13,020
Waiting for me?

62
00:05:14,020 --> 00:05:15,020
Why?

63
00:05:17,020 --> 00:05:18,020
I don't know either.

64
00:05:20,020 --> 00:05:23,020
Since the day I got up a thousand years ago,

65
00:05:23,020 --> 00:05:26,020
I have such a obsession in my heart.

66
00:05:54,020 --> 00:05:55,020
Hua Rongyue.

67
00:05:57,020 --> 00:05:58,020
You actually remember me?

68
00:06:01,020 --> 00:06:04,020
You came to see Hua Zhaoyang?

69
00:06:05,020 --> 00:06:06,020
Just go with her.

70
00:06:07,020 --> 00:06:09,020
I don't want to care about this unfilial sister of mine.

71
00:06:10,020 --> 00:06:11,020
I came to see General Ye Tian.

72
00:06:12,020 --> 00:06:15,020
I heard that he has been controlling the temperature of Tian Du City.

73
00:06:16,020 --> 00:06:18,020
I heard that he has been controlling the temperature of Tian Du City.

74
00:06:19,020 --> 00:06:22,020
I heard that he has been controlling the temperature of Tian Du City.

75
00:06:24,020 --> 00:06:25,020
He is not free now.

76
00:06:27,020 --> 00:06:28,020
You can't see him.

77
00:06:31,020 --> 00:06:32,020
Fine.

78
00:06:32,020 --> 00:06:33,020
It doesn't matter if you don't see him.

79
00:06:34,020 --> 00:06:35,020
Let me ask you.

80
00:06:37,020 --> 00:06:38,020
Ye Tian.

81
00:06:39,020 --> 00:06:41,020
Has he lost the ability to absorb evil thoughts?

82
00:06:44,020 --> 00:06:45,020
How did he know?

83
00:06:51,020 --> 00:06:52,020
Fine.

84
00:06:53,020 --> 00:06:54,020
I have an answer.

85
00:06:55,020 --> 00:06:56,020
I will answer it later.

86
00:07:07,020 --> 00:07:10,020
So you are waiting for Tian Ren?

87
00:07:12,020 --> 00:07:15,020
At first, I always thought so.

88
00:07:16,020 --> 00:07:17,020
But now that I see you,

89
00:07:18,020 --> 00:07:21,020
I feel that the person I want to see is you.

90
00:07:24,020 --> 00:07:27,020
You haven't told me who you are.

91
00:07:28,020 --> 00:07:29,020
Do we know each other?

92
00:07:40,020 --> 00:07:42,020
It doesn't matter if you don't want to say it.

93
00:07:43,020 --> 00:07:44,020
I am too rude.

94
00:07:46,020 --> 00:07:48,020
It seems that there is no reason to say it.

95
00:07:49,020 --> 00:07:50,020
But it is actually true.

96
00:07:53,020 --> 00:07:54,020
I am too rude.

97
00:07:55,020 --> 00:07:56,020
I am too rude.

98
00:07:57,020 --> 00:07:58,020
I am too rude.

99
00:07:59,020 --> 00:08:00,020
I am too rude.

100
00:08:01,020 --> 00:08:02,020
I am too rude.

101
00:08:03,020 --> 00:08:04,020
I am too rude.

102
00:08:05,020 --> 00:08:06,020
I am too rude.

103
00:08:07,020 --> 00:08:08,020
I am too rude.

104
00:08:09,020 --> 00:08:10,020
I am too rude.

105
00:08:11,020 --> 00:08:12,020
I am too rude.

106
00:08:13,020 --> 00:08:14,020
I am too rude.

107
00:08:15,020 --> 00:08:16,020
I am too rude.

108
00:08:17,020 --> 00:08:18,020
I am too rude.

109
00:08:19,020 --> 00:08:20,020
I am too rude.

110
00:08:21,020 --> 00:08:22,020
I am too rude.

111
00:08:24,020 --> 00:08:25,020
I am too rude.

112
00:08:25,020 --> 00:08:26,020
I am too rude.

113
00:08:28,020 --> 00:08:29,020
I am too rude.

114
00:08:34,020 --> 00:08:35,020
This is my message.

115
00:08:37,020 --> 00:08:38,020
Give it back to you.

116
00:08:43,020 --> 00:08:44,020
Give it back?

117
00:08:45,020 --> 00:08:46,020
I have no idea

118
00:08:47,020 --> 00:08:48,020
why I am using this word.

119
00:08:50,020 --> 00:08:51,020
You don't have to do it.

120
00:08:53,020 --> 00:08:55,020
Ye Tian?

121
00:08:59,020 --> 00:09:01,020
It's my name.

122
00:09:01,020 --> 00:09:04,020
It's been a thousand years since no one has been so callous.

123
00:09:05,020 --> 00:09:08,020
So, we really know each other.

124
00:09:11,020 --> 00:09:13,020
My name is Hua Zhaoyang.

125
00:09:13,020 --> 00:09:15,020
The story between us

126
00:09:15,020 --> 00:09:18,020
can be used to describe two words.

127
00:09:18,020 --> 00:09:20,020
Problems?

128
00:09:20,020 --> 00:09:23,020
Then what must have happened between us?

129
00:09:24,020 --> 00:09:26,020
I want to know.

130
00:09:28,020 --> 00:09:30,020
So, Xiu Rou's change

131
00:09:30,020 --> 00:09:32,020
is not necessarily a bad thing.

132
00:09:32,020 --> 00:09:35,020
You are the one who has been in this world.

133
00:09:35,020 --> 00:09:38,020
You have become her change.

134
00:09:41,020 --> 00:09:44,020
Can you tell me?

135
00:09:45,020 --> 00:09:49,020
Then, I'll take you to see it.

136
00:10:03,020 --> 00:10:06,020
You are a general in this world.

137
00:10:09,020 --> 00:10:11,020
General?

138
00:10:14,020 --> 00:10:16,020
I have to take you to the imperial city.

139
00:10:16,020 --> 00:10:18,020
Imperial city?

140
00:10:18,020 --> 00:10:20,020
Those people in the court can't be trusted.

141
00:10:20,020 --> 00:10:22,020
If you really want to follow Xiu Luo Yi,

142
00:10:22,020 --> 00:10:24,020
you can't leave my brother here alone.

143
00:10:24,020 --> 00:10:27,020
Even those soldiers and tribesmen didn't stay.

144
00:10:27,020 --> 00:10:30,020
It has nothing to do with the court.

145
00:10:30,020 --> 00:10:32,020
I have to take him away.

146
00:10:32,020 --> 00:10:34,020
I have to figure out

147
00:10:34,020 --> 00:10:36,020
what is going on.

148
00:10:38,020 --> 00:10:42,020
Ye Xun, you stay here and wait for us to come back.

149
00:10:44,020 --> 00:10:46,020
Okay.

150
00:11:14,020 --> 00:11:16,020
You brought me back this time.

151
00:11:16,020 --> 00:11:18,020
The people in the court...

152
00:11:18,020 --> 00:11:21,020
Don't worry. I have already used the power of the heavens

153
00:11:21,020 --> 00:11:24,020
to make them sleep soundly.

154
00:11:26,220 --> 00:11:28,020
I remember that

155
00:11:28,020 --> 00:11:30,020
on the day of the ascension,

156
00:11:30,020 --> 00:11:34,020
I asked the state minister about the problem of the heavens.

157
00:11:34,020 --> 00:11:38,020
State minister? Does he still remember me?

158
00:11:38,820 --> 00:11:40,820
He doesn't remember me.

159
00:11:40,820 --> 00:11:44,220
But after I got the throne,

160
00:11:44,220 --> 00:11:45,820
he found a place to keep the water and

161
00:11:45,820 --> 00:11:48,820
set up the Gu Yue Sect.

162
00:11:48,820 --> 00:11:51,820
I was the one who named the Gu Yue Sect.

163
00:11:51,820 --> 00:11:54,820
So you were the one who named the name.

164
00:12:03,420 --> 00:12:07,220
I thought that I would find a secret painting

165
00:12:07,220 --> 00:12:09,820
inside your body outside this door.

166
00:12:09,820 --> 00:12:15,420
If the ending of the story is me hurting you,

167
00:12:15,420 --> 00:12:17,420
will you hate me?

168
00:12:40,820 --> 00:12:44,820
On the day of the ascension, I asked the state minister about the problem of the heavens.

169
00:12:44,820 --> 00:12:48,820
I asked the state minister about the problem of the heavens.

170
00:12:48,820 --> 00:12:51,820
I asked the state minister about the problem of the heavens.

171
00:12:51,820 --> 00:12:54,820
I asked the state minister about the problem of the heavens.

172
00:12:54,820 --> 00:12:57,820
I asked the state minister about the problem of the heavens.

173
00:12:57,820 --> 00:13:01,820
I asked the state minister about the problem of the heavens.

174
00:13:01,820 --> 00:13:05,820
I asked the state minister about the problem of the heavens.

175
00:13:05,820 --> 00:13:08,820
I asked the state minister about the problem of the heavens.

176
00:13:08,820 --> 00:13:11,820
I asked the state minister about the problem of the heavens.

177
00:13:11,820 --> 00:13:15,820
I asked the state minister about the problem of the heavens.

178
00:13:15,820 --> 00:13:18,820
I asked the state minister about the problem of the heavens.

179
00:13:18,820 --> 00:13:21,820
I asked the state minister about the problem of the heavens.

180
00:13:21,820 --> 00:13:24,820
I asked the state minister about the problem of the heavens.

181
00:13:24,820 --> 00:13:27,820
I asked the state minister about the problem of the heavens.

182
00:13:27,820 --> 00:13:30,820
I asked the state minister about the problem of the heavens.

183
00:13:30,820 --> 00:13:33,820
I asked the state minister about the problem of the heavens.

184
00:13:33,820 --> 00:13:37,820
No matter what, I won't ask the future.

185
00:13:37,820 --> 00:13:41,820
I will be reborn and live my life.

186
00:13:41,820 --> 00:13:44,820
I am brave enough to live my life.

187
00:13:44,820 --> 00:13:46,820

00:13:46,820 --> 00:13:52,820
I am just a simple life.
