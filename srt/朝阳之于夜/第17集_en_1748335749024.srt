1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,980
Is it a good idea

2
00:00:32,020 --> 00:00:36,660
To meet and be together with me

3
00:00:36,720 --> 00:00:39,620
Нап discrete

4
00:00:40,540 --> 00:00:43,940
The Queen of Brands

5
00:00:44,540 --> 00:00:47,360
Episode 5

6
00:00:56,840 --> 00:00:59,340
You haven't learned golf since pickover.

7
00:00:59,340 --> 00:01:00,500
Look at you.

8
00:01:00,500 --> 00:01:02,180
You haven't learned anything for so long.

9
00:01:02,180 --> 00:01:03,180
Did you teach me?

10
00:01:03,780 --> 00:01:05,140
You're so good at talking.

11
00:01:05,140 --> 00:01:06,220
You don't even cook.

12
00:01:07,020 --> 00:01:08,980
You're teaching me this?

13
00:01:10,660 --> 00:01:11,420
Yes.

14
00:01:11,820 --> 00:01:13,460
You're the best in the world.

15
00:01:13,700 --> 00:01:14,860
You teach me this.

16
00:01:19,180 --> 00:01:19,820
Get out of the way.

17
00:01:23,580 --> 00:01:24,660
What do you want me to do?

18
00:01:27,660 --> 00:01:29,020
I don't want you to do anything.

19
00:01:29,380 --> 00:01:30,900
I want to leave, okay?

20
00:01:31,260 --> 00:01:31,940
Kneel.

21
00:01:34,260 --> 00:01:35,580
You can't blame me.

22
00:01:36,300 --> 00:01:38,020
You have to blame my master Tian Dong.

23
00:01:38,580 --> 00:01:39,380
The main thing is

24
00:01:39,500 --> 00:01:41,460
we can't escape from

25
00:01:41,580 --> 00:01:42,860
Master's warning

26
00:01:43,940 --> 00:01:46,060
without being the talent of the Celestial Man.

27
00:01:46,220 --> 00:01:48,300
My freedom is up to you.

28
00:01:49,580 --> 00:01:50,380
I'm going to eat.

29
00:01:50,660 --> 00:01:51,380
Come on.

30
00:01:54,900 --> 00:01:56,300
What kind of a person is he?

31
00:01:56,420 --> 00:01:58,780
I will definitely leave here.

32
00:02:07,180 --> 00:02:09,420
After surrounded by a slight heart,

33
00:02:09,420 --> 00:02:10,820
and dragged from the heart,

34
00:02:10,820 --> 00:02:11,860
perhaps...

35
00:02:12,420 --> 00:02:13,540
Where are you going?

36
00:02:17,700 --> 00:02:19,580
I'm going to another � Le Asajin.

37
00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:21,940
Then why do you bringing me to the interruptions dwelling?

38
00:02:21,940 --> 00:02:23,340
Then why did you bring a bag?

39
00:02:29,620 --> 00:02:31,460
Uncle, let me be honest with you.

40
00:02:31,620 --> 00:02:32,620
I want freedom.

41
00:02:33,220 --> 00:02:34,660
I advise you to keep it safe.

42
00:02:37,540 --> 00:02:38,820
You Gu Yue Sect

43
00:02:39,180 --> 00:02:41,100
is just a waste of time.

44
00:02:41,620 --> 00:02:42,180
Why?

45
00:02:42,380 --> 00:02:43,220
You don't want to?

46
00:02:45,020 --> 00:02:45,860
Fu.

47
00:02:46,340 --> 00:02:47,020
Fu.

48
00:02:49,780 --> 00:02:51,500
Uncle, if you can

49
00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:53,060
let me go,

50
00:02:53,620 --> 00:02:55,380
I'll take revenge on you.

51
00:02:56,540 --> 00:02:58,180
Why are you so insolent?

52
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:02,340
My brother is still waiting for me in the mountains.

53
00:03:02,580 --> 00:03:03,540
He's gone.

54
00:03:03,740 --> 00:03:05,100
He can't live on.

55
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:06,420
Zhao Yang is gone.

56
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:07,580
He's fine.

57
00:03:07,700 --> 00:03:09,500
We're not talking about the same thing.

58
00:03:09,620 --> 00:03:10,940
I have to find him.

59
00:03:11,220 --> 00:03:11,940
Ye Tian.

60
00:03:12,900 --> 00:03:15,420
Do you know why I'm here at this moment?

61
00:03:16,260 --> 00:03:17,140
I know.

62
00:03:17,340 --> 00:03:19,180
Because you are the most responsible and most responsible

63
00:03:19,340 --> 00:03:21,460
and most qualified master of the Gu Yue Sect.

64
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:23,500
Thank you.

65
00:03:24,140 --> 00:03:25,380
But it seems

66
00:03:25,700 --> 00:03:26,940
that Zhao Yang has another arrangement.

67
00:03:28,540 --> 00:03:29,260
He's here.

68
00:03:37,580 --> 00:03:38,060
Gui.

69
00:03:41,780 --> 00:03:42,900
My good disciple.

70
00:03:42,980 --> 00:03:44,100
Where are you going?

71
00:03:45,820 --> 00:03:46,980
Zhao Yang.

72
00:03:47,220 --> 00:03:48,820
You're a useless person.

73
00:03:49,100 --> 00:03:50,740
You're going to make me kneel here tonight.

74
00:03:51,540 --> 00:03:53,220
I'm going to go down the mountain to find my brother.

75
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:54,740
I know.

76
00:03:55,020 --> 00:03:55,940
Don't worry.

77
00:03:56,220 --> 00:03:59,060
The Gu Yue Sect is the most responsible and most responsible.

78
00:04:12,980 --> 00:04:14,180
What are you doing?

79
00:04:21,700 --> 00:04:22,420
I...

80
00:04:22,660 --> 00:04:23,420
I...

81
00:04:23,620 --> 00:04:24,580
Ye Xun?

82
00:04:25,460 --> 00:04:26,140
Brother.

83
00:04:26,380 --> 00:04:27,220
Why are you here?

84
00:04:27,420 --> 00:04:27,860
How are you?

85
00:04:28,100 --> 00:04:28,780
Are you touched?

86
00:04:28,780 --> 00:04:29,260
I...

87
00:04:29,420 --> 00:04:31,100
It's the first time I've seen you

88
00:04:31,260 --> 00:04:32,220
and tied you up.

89
00:04:33,980 --> 00:04:35,340
You're really too kind.

90
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:36,380
My brother and I

91
00:04:36,380 --> 00:04:37,620
just came to your sect to get the money.

92
00:04:37,780 --> 00:04:38,900
Why can't you let us go?

93
00:04:39,340 --> 00:04:40,660
You have no shame.

94
00:04:40,820 --> 00:04:43,100
You should be the Tian Ren Flower in your body.

95
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:44,940
Tian Ren Flower? Tian Ren Flower?

96
00:04:45,100 --> 00:04:46,660
I don't know what Tian Ren Flower is.

97
00:04:47,620 --> 00:04:48,660
I don't understand.

98
00:04:48,780 --> 00:04:49,660
I don't know.

99
00:04:49,700 --> 00:04:50,740
I don't know.

100
00:04:51,220 --> 00:04:51,660
I don't understand.

101
00:04:51,820 --> 00:04:52,260
I don't know.

102
00:04:52,580 --> 00:04:55,140
The Gu Yue Sect is full of food and shelter.

103
00:04:55,300 --> 00:04:57,100
Why do you always think about running away?

104
00:04:57,940 --> 00:04:58,860
What do you know?

105
00:04:59,340 --> 00:05:01,020
It's hard to be a good man.

106
00:05:01,460 --> 00:05:02,820
I'm still waiting to write my book.

107
00:05:02,980 --> 00:05:04,020
I'm waiting for it.

108
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:05,900
You're writing a book?

109
00:05:06,740 --> 00:05:09,620
The fastest person in the world is me.

110
00:05:10,220 --> 00:05:11,420
It's the last step.

111
00:05:11,620 --> 00:05:12,660
I'm waiting for it.

112
00:05:13,620 --> 00:05:15,780
So you wrote the book.

113
00:05:15,980 --> 00:05:16,460
No.

114
00:05:16,700 --> 00:05:17,860
What do you mean by that?

115
00:05:18,100 --> 00:05:19,540
Do you know how to speak?

116
00:05:20,580 --> 00:05:21,860
I've read it before.

117
00:05:22,340 --> 00:05:25,100
Tian Ren Flower is like the one in your painting.

118
00:05:25,220 --> 00:05:26,180
It's called Cloud Grass.

119
00:05:27,140 --> 00:05:28,180
Cloud Grass?

120
00:05:28,700 --> 00:05:30,740
So it's the same as the one in Tian Ren Flower.

121
00:05:30,900 --> 00:05:31,740
Then I...

122
00:05:33,060 --> 00:05:33,580
No.

123
00:05:33,740 --> 00:05:36,100
It's not the focus of the present.

124
00:05:36,220 --> 00:05:37,020
What do you mean?

125
00:05:37,140 --> 00:05:39,660
Is there anyone who can read the book?

126
00:05:40,540 --> 00:05:41,500
Of course.

127
00:05:41,620 --> 00:05:42,740
Why are you talking nonsense?

128
00:05:42,900 --> 00:05:43,620
I'll read it.

129
00:05:43,740 --> 00:05:44,660
You read it later.

130
00:05:46,420 --> 00:05:47,780
I forgot the exact one.

131
00:05:47,860 --> 00:05:49,740
Anyway, the book I read

132
00:05:49,860 --> 00:05:52,420
is very similar to the one in the book.

133
00:05:52,620 --> 00:05:53,940
What's the difference?

134
00:05:54,100 --> 00:05:55,340
It's not responsible.

135
00:05:55,740 --> 00:05:56,820
Okay. I'm tired.

136
00:05:56,940 --> 00:05:58,060
I won't bother you anymore.

137
00:05:59,180 --> 00:05:59,700
Sis.

138
00:06:00,020 --> 00:06:00,980
How about

139
00:06:01,300 --> 00:06:02,900
taking it as your apprentice?

140
00:06:03,020 --> 00:06:03,540
How about it?

141
00:06:06,660 --> 00:06:09,780
How can you take me as your apprentice?

142
00:06:18,060 --> 00:06:18,780
Exactly.

143
00:06:37,620 --> 00:06:38,660
value target!

144
00:06:40,060 --> 00:06:41,500
Focus on the foreground!

145
00:06:43,340 --> 00:06:44,500
There's one plate of servants.

146
00:06:44,780 --> 00:06:45,940
Okay.

147
00:06:45,940 --> 00:06:46,940
Okay, okay, okay.

148
00:06:47,100 --> 00:06:48,100
All gone.

149
00:06:52,140 --> 00:06:53,180
Not bad, Ye Xun.

150
00:06:54,540 --> 00:06:55,740
You've mastered the medicine.

151
00:06:58,100 --> 00:06:58,980
Master taught me well.

152
00:06:59,100 --> 00:07:00,580
Okay, let's practice the new method.

153
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:04,380
Please excuse me.

154
00:07:05,620 --> 00:07:06,260
Ye Xun,

155
00:07:06,660 --> 00:07:07,420
the medicine is good.

156
00:07:11,260 --> 00:07:12,180
Look, look.

157
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:14,540
Why is the difference between people and people so big?

158
00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:16,180
What's wrong?

159
00:07:16,340 --> 00:07:17,580
My brother is a smart guy.

160
00:07:17,700 --> 00:07:18,300
Aren't you convinced?

161
00:07:19,860 --> 00:07:21,140
I'm convinced.

162
00:07:21,940 --> 00:07:23,660
Your sister is better than you.

163
00:07:26,580 --> 00:07:27,220
How is it?

164
00:07:27,340 --> 00:07:28,140
You're not cool?

165
00:07:29,740 --> 00:07:30,260
Shut up!

166
00:07:34,300 --> 00:07:35,500
If you keep doing this,

167
00:07:35,780 --> 00:07:37,540
when can I go out and play?

168
00:07:40,700 --> 00:07:41,180
No,

169
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:42,780
I have to find the master and tell him clearly.

170
00:07:43,740 --> 00:07:45,020
You practice here with me.

171
00:07:53,980 --> 00:07:54,820
Why are you still here?

172
00:07:55,420 --> 00:07:56,700
My sister taught you to practice.

173
00:07:56,820 --> 00:07:57,980
Didn't you hear that?

174
00:07:59,780 --> 00:08:00,860
I didn't hear it.

175
00:08:01,100 --> 00:08:02,100
I just don't want to practice.

176
00:08:03,380 --> 00:08:05,700
You're so naive.

177
00:08:06,100 --> 00:08:07,540
How dare you to teach my sister?

178
00:08:08,300 --> 00:08:09,500
I'm going to teach you a lesson

179
00:08:09,620 --> 00:08:10,500
for my sister.

180
00:08:12,780 --> 00:08:13,540
You...

181
00:08:20,340 --> 00:08:21,300
You're a water bottle.

182
00:08:21,580 --> 00:08:22,940
You're embarrassed to teach me.

183
00:08:23,900 --> 00:08:24,460
You clearly...

184
00:08:24,580 --> 00:08:24,980
Shut up.

185
00:08:26,300 --> 00:08:27,860
I know how to practice.

186
00:08:28,100 --> 00:08:29,340
If you dare to say it,

187
00:08:29,540 --> 00:08:30,300
I'll tell you.

188
00:08:30,820 --> 00:08:32,860
The ending won't be too beautiful.

189
00:08:37,180 --> 00:08:38,420
Pretend.

190
00:08:43,220 --> 00:08:44,780
The responsibility of J.A. B.

191
00:08:45,180 --> 00:09:11,280
I gave the

192
00:09:11,280 --> 00:09:12,800
Zhuang, keep pretending.

193
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:15,080
What are you talking about?

194
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:16,120
I don't understand.

195
00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:19,560
You're a good dancer.

196
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:21,920
But you have to pretend to be innocent in front of me.

197
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:24,600
Pretending to be weak, pretending to be unruly, right?

198
00:09:26,520 --> 00:09:27,360
I...

199
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:29,680
I don't understand what you're talking about.

200
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:32,120
You've told me.

201
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:34,280
As long as your dance moves are trained,

202
00:09:34,280 --> 00:09:36,280
you can become a natural candidate.

203
00:09:36,280 --> 00:09:37,200
But you...

204
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:39,040
You have to pretend to be unruly.

205
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:41,240
Don't you think you're despicable?

206
00:09:42,280 --> 00:09:43,880
I despicable?

207
00:09:43,880 --> 00:09:45,640
I'm not despicable.

208
00:09:45,640 --> 00:09:47,240
You're a natural candidate.

209
00:09:47,240 --> 00:09:48,720
You're so good-looking.

210
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:50,680
What?

211
00:09:50,680 --> 00:09:52,160
Why don't you go?

212
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:54,080
Aren't you afraid of staying in the Gu Yue Sect?

213
00:09:56,280 --> 00:09:57,280
Ye Tian,

214
00:09:57,720 --> 00:09:59,480
do you want to escape from the Gu Yue Sect

215
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:01,480
more than me?

216
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:03,240
Master,

217
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:04,880
I don't understand what you're talking about.

218
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:06,840
How about this?

219
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:08,080
Let's make a deal.

220
00:10:12,280 --> 00:10:13,640
Open up the general.

221
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:15,480
It's like this.

222
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:19,280
You can show your true colors in front of everyone,

223
00:10:19,280 --> 00:10:21,280
and do the step-by-step of the natural candidate.

224
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:22,280
Then,

225
00:10:22,280 --> 00:10:24,280
you can take the position of the natural candidate for me.

226
00:10:24,280 --> 00:10:25,480
I'll do it.

227
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:26,480
I'll do it.

228
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:27,480
I'll do it.

229
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:28,480
I'll do it.

230
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:29,480
I'll do it.

231
00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:30,480
I'll do it.

232
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:31,480
I'll do it.

233
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:33,480
Then,

234
00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:35,480
I'll get the big deal.

235
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:36,880
Did you hear me?

236
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:38,480
Then,

237
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:43,280
I'll learn those amazing weapons and magic

238
00:10:43,280 --> 00:10:44,880
and then I'll come back to save you.

239
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:45,480
What do you think?

240
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:48,880
Master,

241
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:51,480
do you think you're a natural candidate?

242
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:52,880
You can still do these things

243
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:54,680
with your mountain and water.

244
00:10:54,680 --> 00:10:56,680
Which one sounds better?

245
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:02,080
What do you think?

246
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:04,280
I think

247
00:11:04,280 --> 00:11:07,080
I think it's definitely the six-year-old's easy to achieve.

248
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:20,480
You're pretending.

249
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:21,480
You're pretending.

250
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:23,680
Unfortunately,

251
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:26,280
the natural candidate knows you know me.

252
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:01,480
You're pretending.
