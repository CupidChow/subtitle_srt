1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,140
Excellent.

2
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:37,720
The成

3
00:00:38,420 --> 00:00:39,860
Forbidden

4
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:45,620
Episode 16

5
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:51,640
My master has passed away.

6
00:00:51,800 --> 00:00:53,300
You nearly got me too.

7
00:00:53,880 --> 00:00:54,780
Now that we've var房 sólo

8
00:00:54,880 --> 00:00:57,780
it can be a real natural.

9
00:00:58,160 --> 00:00:59,240
From the day

10
00:00:59,240 --> 00:01:00,640
I'm already a god.

11
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:04,560
Everything is as ancient as it is.

12
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:07,560
The evil year of Xiu Luo is born.

13
00:01:08,160 --> 00:01:09,680
After killing Xiu Luo,

14
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:12,280
this Yin-Yang Yu will be divided into two pieces.

15
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:14,840
Now you only need to marry the monk

16
00:01:15,120 --> 00:01:18,880
to become a real god.

17
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:25,880
But obviously,

18
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:28,600
when I woke up, he was already a god.

19
00:01:29,800 --> 00:01:30,760
Is this jade

20
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:32,880
given to me by Master?

21
00:01:33,480 --> 00:01:35,040
Why don't I remember it at all?

22
00:01:35,320 --> 00:01:36,800
You have forgotten a lot of things

23
00:01:37,480 --> 00:01:38,880
in the past five years.

24
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:40,800
But it's okay.

25
00:01:41,480 --> 00:01:42,920
Go and wait for the god.

26
00:02:29,320 --> 00:02:31,840
Is this the heaven's long street?

27
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:38,560
The flower-sweeping yang is full of Tao.

28
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:40,240
Xiu Luo is already a god.

29
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:42,800
But if you want to become a god,

30
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:44,400
you still have a chance.

31
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:45,240
What?

32
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:48,120
You still need to fulfill the most powerful obsession

33
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:49,960
in the world.

34
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:52,000
The one you should save the most.

35
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:00,620
Master Zeeh.

36
00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:01,580
Master.

37
00:03:15,620 --> 00:03:16,360
Qi pierwsze qu nh99

38
00:03:21,740 --> 00:03:22,540
Xiu luü

39
00:03:23,420 --> 00:03:25,380
Find her in the turns

40
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:29,880
Be with her hardones in past times

41
00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:32,880
and draw his evil thoughts.

42
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:36,480
The jade pendant in your hand is tied to the Heavenly Emperor.

43
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:41,480
It's the only thing that can be taken back by the Soul of the Soul.

44
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:44,880
Your natural power will be sealed into the Spirit Jade

45
00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:47,880
and you will be able to return to the Soul.

46
00:03:47,880 --> 00:03:51,480
Your memory will also be sealed into the Soul of the Soul

47
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:54,480
and you will be replaced.

48
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:03,680
The Soul of the Soul will be born in the year of the evil.

49
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:05,680
After killing the Soul of the Soul,

50
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:08,880
this Yin-Yang Jade will be divided into two pieces.

51
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:15,480
I have a question.

52
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:19,280
How many times have I been defeated by the jade pendant

53
00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:21,880
that has not been returned to the Soul of the Soul?

54
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:27,880
Has it been that I have been in the Soul of the Soul

55
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:30,080
since I was born?

56
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:37,080
I feel like I have some memories of the day.

57
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:00,740
That girl is puerful, right?

58
00:05:00,740 --> 00:05:04,080
She is not your kind of bastard.

59
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:15,680
She has spoured so much,

60
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:19,320
but she has not been returned to the Soul of the Soul of the Soul.

61
00:05:24,580 --> 00:05:26,780
Let me try.

62
00:05:27,880 --> 00:05:29,080
What's the problem?

63
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:30,280
What happened?

64
00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:33,680
This is a world where the sun and the moon

65
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:35,880
are in the same place.

66
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:38,240
Every day, the sky and earth

67
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:39,680
are divided into two.

68
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:41,080
Every day, the sky and earth

69
00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:42,480
are divided into two.

70
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:44,920
The light and rain between the two

71
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:46,400
are equal.

72
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:49,480
But when you and Ye Tiancheng

73
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:51,120
are all in a mess,

74
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:53,000
no matter what,

75
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:56,120
you have to leave with love and hate.

76
00:05:56,680 --> 00:05:59,560
I gave you three thousand times of the cycle

77
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:01,120
and it's always like this.

78
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:03,000
It's always turning around.

79
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:05,920
It's been ten days

80
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:08,880
and you've been back to your original state.

81
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:10,240
But I woke up.

82
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:12,000
Isn't it a good thing?

83
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:15,000
I will still remember you.

84
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:17,800
Even if you give me three thousand times of the cycle,

85
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:21,440
you have to leave with the right time.

86
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:24,640
What if I refuse?

87
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:28,560
No one can refuse to go to the warehouse.

88
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:32,080
Do you know what Ye Tiancheng will say?

89
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:35,080
Go to the warehouse!

90
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:59,160
Remember your past and prospects.

91
00:07:01,760 --> 00:07:03,960
Do you still remember me?

92
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:10,400
I haven't forgotten at all.

93
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:16,720
I'm not a fixed person.

94
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:18,760
Please teach me China History.

95
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:22,600
If you can use

96
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:23,760
If you have a chance,

97
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,000
I hope you can

98
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,040
go to the mountain with Chief Hua.

99
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:29,680
I don't have the money to pay you.

100
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:31,280
The monster in the mountain is not expensive.

101
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:33,320
Don't pay me.

102
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:34,920
As long as you're willing to take me.

103
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:44,440
You don't let others touch you.

104
00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:46,200
It's because you're afraid that others will touch you

105
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:47,600
and you'll be afraid of the sunset.

106
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:50,920
But I don't want you to suffer this pain.

107
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:57,600
I've made my choice.

108
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:00,600
If I were you,

109
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:02,720
I might have the same choice.

110
00:08:04,280 --> 00:08:05,720
But we have to admit that

111
00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:07,600
the one who has memories

112
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:08,920
is the most painful.

113
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:20,360
You've been calling my name in your dream.

114
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:21,360
Yes.

115
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:24,360
And I've always been

116
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:26,760
a stranger to you.

117
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:29,760
On the surface,

118
00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:31,560
I'm here to get the bill.

119
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:34,560
But it looks like

120
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:36,200
it's possible that God

121
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:37,640
made a mistake

122
00:08:37,640 --> 00:08:39,040
and let us meet again.

123
00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:41,560
I have to choose

124
00:08:41,560 --> 00:08:42,560
to seal all the memories

125
00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:43,760
in your mind

126
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:45,960
in this rain.

127
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:52,560
You've been

128
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:54,160
trying to leave the band.

129
00:08:55,560 --> 00:08:56,960
Let's leave together tonight.

130
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:11,760
You're a bit different from the people in the prison.

131
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:14,760
What happened?

132
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:18,160
The superior wants to seal our memories.

133
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:22,960
Let's start over.

134
00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:26,160
You're a dog.

135
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:27,160
Don't mind him.

136
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:31,360
No matter how things change,

137
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:36,160
we'll always be together.

138
00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:47,160
Let's spend the days together.

139
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:47,800
I've never been哦

140
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:48,680
longer than you.

141
00:09:49,280 --> 00:09:50,400
Wait for me.

142
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:52,400
I love you.

143
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:55,160
Thoughts will be over.

144
00:09:55,160 --> 00:09:56,200
You finally had me.

145
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:09,160
I do not know

146
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:10,560
how complicated it is

147
00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:11,800
to stay together.

148
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:13,360
感受

149
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:15,960
those happiness between the lovers.

150
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:18,960
By the time we were young,

151
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:22,160
the melhor was the brightness of the点亮.

152
00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:24,400
However,

153
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,480
we found the fragrance of the 컳 한.

154
00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:30,400
The only question

155
00:10:30,920 --> 00:10:32,520
is that greetings

156
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:35,880
are the only thing that we know.

157
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:38,000
Dayou.

158
00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:40,900
We'll finallyacquake

159
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:44,000
to find happiness for each other.

160
00:10:45,080 --> 00:10:46,000
In this case,

161
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:48,400
our heart

162
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:50,640
will only be left with Ningjing

163
00:10:51,280 --> 00:10:52,640
and deep love.

164
00:10:54,040 --> 00:10:56,720
This is the end of our legendary legend.

165
00:10:59,200 --> 00:10:59,920
Brother,

166
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:02,640
he's always asking for the position of the imperial guard.

167
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:03,840
He's a small liar.

168
00:11:04,120 --> 00:11:05,360
He's not willing to be taught.

169
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:06,800
See?

170
00:11:07,280 --> 00:11:08,840
The imperial guard is a great man.

171
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:10,480
How can he be so foolish?

172
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:13,120
Of course I won't be foolish.

173
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:17,520
Come in.

174
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:26,680
Your Majesty.

175
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:41,280
You've always wanted to be a national adviser.

176
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:45,160
Then, what about talking about Feng Lu?

177
00:11:46,760 --> 00:11:48,360
Since you want to talk about Feng Lu with me,

178
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:52,240
why don't you consider another position?

179
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:08,520
Hua Rongyu.

180
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:10,280
Brother.

181
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:13,600
Hua Rongyu.

182
00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:15,360
Can you keep your temper?

183
00:12:16,040 --> 00:12:16,760
Shut up.

184
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:19,160
Ye Xun.

185
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:20,920
It's over.

186
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:23,960
Someone's apologizing.

187
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:25,480
I'm just here to apologize.

188
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:27,560
Are you apologizing?

189
00:12:28,840 --> 00:12:29,960
I'm not apologizing.

190
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:31,240
Why are you saying that?

191
00:12:32,520 --> 00:12:33,240
Ye Tian.

192
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:44,000
I haven't seen you for a long time.

193
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:12,760
What are you doing?

194
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:13,720
What?

195
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:15,280
This is my new magic.

196
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:16,640
Isn't it amazing?

197
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:18,480
Amazing? You're so smart.

198
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:19,480
Let go of me.

199
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:23,080
Master, don't you think you're not good at magic?

200
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:24,400
What magic?

201
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:26,680
Of course it's a magic that makes me listen to you.

202
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:28,400
Really?

203
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:29,800
Then try it.

204
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:31,120
It's expensive.

205
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:31,800
No, no, no.

206
00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:33,640
You like reading my novel the most, right?

207
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:35,200
I'm not good at it.

208
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:36,160
I'm not good at it.

209
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:37,160
I'm not good at it.

210
00:13:37,160 --> 00:13:38,280
I'm not good at it.

211
00:13:38,280 --> 00:13:39,240
I'm not good at it.

212
00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:40,240
I'm not good at it.

213
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:41,240
I'm not good at it.

214
00:13:41,240 --> 00:13:41,960
Tell me.

215
00:13:41,960 --> 00:13:43,680
I'll write it tonight.

216
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:44,720
I'll write it for you.

217
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:45,520
Okay?

218
00:13:45,520 --> 00:13:47,400
I'll write it all.

219
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:48,360
It's expensive.

220
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:49,160
Don't, don't, don't.

221
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:50,960
Come back.

222
00:13:51,280 --> 00:13:51,840
Come back, Ye Tian.

223
00:13:51,840 --> 00:13:52,760
I'm not going back.

224
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:54,440
Come back.

225
00:13:54,440 --> 00:13:55,360
Come here.

226
00:13:58,920 --> 00:13:59,560
Don't run.

227
00:13:59,560 --> 00:14:00,600
Come and chase me.

228
00:14:01,480 --> 00:14:03,000
Little wood.

229
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:04,320
Come and have a look.

230
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:05,600
Little wood.

231
00:14:06,640 --> 00:14:08,400
This book is very tight.

232
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:10,160
Three books are worth buying.

233
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:11,160
There will be a discount.

234
00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:14,520
When the sky is completely bright,

235
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:19,800
it's the only time that Zhao Yang and the cruel night can be melted.

236
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:22,840
The smoke is very strong.

237
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,000
That's right.

238
00:14:25,560 --> 00:14:26,440
It's not good.

239
00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:27,640
I'll give you a discount.

240
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:29,640
The Taoist should read these.

241
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:32,280
Zhao Yang knows the night.

242
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:35,280
This book is not so boring.

243
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:11,680
