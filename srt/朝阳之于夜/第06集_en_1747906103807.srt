1
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,000
So bloody.

2
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:33,520
Only the legendary Xiuluo can have it.

3
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:37,240
It's really Prince Ye Tian.

4
00:01:38,480 --> 00:01:39,280
Ye Tian.

5
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:41,000
It's dangerous.

6
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:44,360
Ye Tian.

7
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:47,840
Ye Tian, don't be afraid.

8
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:49,480
I'm here to save you.

9
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:50,480
As long as I hold you,

10
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:51,600
I can make up for my memory.

11
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:53,000
Then I can save you.

12
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:55,320
Ye Tian.

13
00:01:55,880 --> 00:01:56,600
Ye Tian.

14
00:01:56,760 --> 00:01:57,520
Ye Tian.

15
00:01:57,640 --> 00:01:58,320
Ye Tian.

16
00:01:58,480 --> 00:01:59,320
Ye Tian.

17
00:01:59,440 --> 00:02:00,320
Ye Tian.

18
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:03,480
Ye Ti...

19
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:06,960
Ye Ti.

20
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:08,400
Your old friend is here.

21
00:02:09,040 --> 00:02:09,720
Hello?

22
00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:24,760
Ye Tian.

23
00:02:29,320 --> 00:02:30,320
If you wake up,

24
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:32,240
give her back her memory.

25
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:30,800
Master.

26
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:34,240
시간dom

27
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:46,600
pepper

28
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:47,480
yeluo

29
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:51,920
Behind me.

30
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:55,440
Guje

31
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:56,600
you rest assured

32
00:03:57,320 --> 00:03:58,400
Now i can't hurt her.

33
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:00,640
Theot 덕天下之力

34
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:03,280
The God of Surprise

35
00:04:03,320 --> 00:04:05,720
The Love choses

36
00:04:06,920 --> 00:04:08,680
The Zhao Yao is still out there

37
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:10,360
I can't protect her anymore

38
00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:00,600
Do you remember me?

39
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:31,080
Are you outsourced by me?

40
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:31,480
Ent Walker

41
00:05:35,580 --> 00:05:36,920
by Goto

42
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:48,160
It is exactly a Junior God Flower

43
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:49,440
that I used to save him.

44
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:51,480
Why did it become

45
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:53,120
Mi vetal flower as a token of his resentment?

46
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:56,520
Could his resentment

47
00:05:57,160 --> 00:05:58,840
be проблема for

48
00:05:59,320 --> 00:06:00,320
we've been through all.

49
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:22,320
The present time he

50
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:23,840
should have just returned to Ye Tian.

51
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:25,120
I have to go find him now.

52
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:27,520
Tianren,

53
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:29,080
what happened?

54
00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:30,960
Not everyone

55
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:32,880
must be a Heavenly Man.

56
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:34,400
State Preceptor,

57
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:36,520
you will become

58
00:06:36,520 --> 00:06:38,080
an amazing Taoist in the future.

59
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:39,840
You will be able to open mountains and build bridges,

60
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:41,480
and lead the right path.

61
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:44,040
You will lead the real Heavenly Man.

62
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:45,640
I promise you.

63
00:07:45,640 --> 00:07:47,200
After you asked me,

64
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:50,400
I understood a lot of things.

65
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:55,440
The reason you came to my side

66
00:07:55,920 --> 00:07:56,920
is because

67
00:07:56,920 --> 00:07:59,320
I'm about to become the most terrifying monster

68
00:07:59,320 --> 00:08:01,000
and I've been in danger for thousands of years.

69
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:01,800
Right?

70
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:05,320
At least, I can still get back at you.

71
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:08,000
And you,

72
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,120
you are the most terrifying monster in the world.

73
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:11,840
You are the most terrifying monster in the world.

74
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:13,200
You are the most terrifying monster in the world.

75
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:14,400
You are the most terrifying monster in the world.

76
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:16,120
And you,

77
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:19,240
you are the only Heavenly Man in the world.

78
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:21,920
You have your responsibilities.

79
00:08:22,280 --> 00:08:23,720
You have your mission.

80
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:26,240
Our destiny

81
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:28,720
can only be mutual.

82
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:31,680
It's like the night is getting closer.

83
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:35,000
For you and me,

84
00:08:38,040 --> 00:08:40,040
we are like this poisonous monster.

85
00:08:42,160 --> 00:08:43,000
Dangerous.

86
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,000
It's fatal.

87
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:47,960
It must be eliminated.

88
00:08:54,280 --> 00:08:55,880
You are not fatal poison.

89
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:57,960
Don't go to the netherworld to stimulate it.

90
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,120
I will find a way

91
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:03,880
to get rid of your evil thoughts.

92
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:06,800
You can't do that anymore.

93
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:10,920
I want the whole city to be buried with me.

94
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:13,320
For my thoughts

95
00:09:13,880 --> 00:09:15,680
and grief.

96
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:18,320
Buried?

97
00:09:19,160 --> 00:09:20,080
What do you mean?

98
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:22,600
It's what you heard.

99
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:25,760
Hua Zhao Yang.

100
00:09:31,520 --> 00:09:32,560
You are a human.

101
00:09:32,920 --> 00:09:34,000
You should know that.

102
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:37,960
How can I be the only one

103
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:39,920
who can be the only one

104
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:42,280
who can be the only one who can be the only one?

105
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:44,360
The pain and grief

106
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:46,200
of everyone in the world

107
00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:47,560
are all gathered

108
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:50,480
on me at this moment.

109
00:09:51,560 --> 00:09:53,160
Can you really

110
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:54,360
get rid of this hatred?

111
00:09:55,520 --> 00:09:56,880
Except killing me,

112
00:09:57,560 --> 00:09:59,400
you seem to have no other choice.

113
00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:08,600
No.

114
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:13,040
Wake up.

115
00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:22,280
I'm curious.

116
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:26,360
If you had the memory of the Heavenly People

117
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:27,960
and knew that the Heavenly Flower

118
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:30,360
would induce the birth of the Dark Flower,

119
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:33,360
would you still save me?

120
00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:39,560
You really know the situation.

121
00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:42,760
I'll tell you.

122
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:46,200
I turned the Heavenly Flower

123
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:48,400
into the Dark Flower of the Sura.

124
00:10:49,280 --> 00:10:50,880
It's stained with hatred

125
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:52,560
and looks like poison.

126
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:55,560
I sprinkled it in the air

127
00:10:55,960 --> 00:10:57,480
and in the water.

128
00:10:58,080 --> 00:10:59,960
Everyone in the imperial city

129
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:01,640
will be stained with it.

130
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:04,160
Everyone in the imperial city

131
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:05,640
will be stained with it.

132
00:11:05,640 --> 00:11:07,160
Everyone in the imperial city

133
00:11:07,160 --> 00:11:08,520
will be stained with it.

134
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:11,120
They will be crazy.

135
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:13,480
After they're crazy,

136
00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:15,400
they'll find their own way to death

137
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:17,520
and be free.

138
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:23,320
I put the Sura Long Knife

139
00:11:23,640 --> 00:11:24,720
in the pharmacy.

140
00:11:26,280 --> 00:11:27,640
It's stained with hatred

141
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:29,760
and stained with hatred.

142
00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:32,320
You can only get it

143
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:33,720
after killing me.

144
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:35,800
What will happen

145
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:38,400
if I die?

146
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,200
If you die,

147
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,680
the Sura will be reborn

148
00:11:45,280 --> 00:11:46,880
and continue to be reincarnated.

149
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:50,440
And the Sura

150
00:11:51,520 --> 00:11:53,280
will still choose me

151
00:11:53,520 --> 00:11:55,520
as its poor pet because of fate.

152
00:11:56,400 --> 00:11:57,720
As a Heavenly Person,

153
00:11:58,640 --> 00:12:01,000
you can't escape from this responsibility.

154
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:04,240
You have to be in the cycle of time.

155
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:06,160
Am I right?

156
00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:12,280
Why don't you

157
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:14,680
make a choice now?

158
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:19,520
Either you take me back to the palace

159
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:21,120
to keep my life

160
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:22,680
and find another way.

161
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:24,240
Or

162
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:27,120
you kill me

163
00:12:28,040 --> 00:12:29,240
for the sake of the people.

164
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:32,080
What's your choice?

165
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:33,320
I know it.

166
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:36,000
Stand up.

167
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:37,840
Are you neonated?

168
00:12:50,340 --> 00:12:51,160
I'm your princess.

169
00:12:51,460 --> 00:12:52,420
Okay, all right.

170
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:53,900
Headvest.

171
00:12:55,000 --> 00:13:00,080
I'm not

172
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:34,080
Why do you have to live up to your reputation?

173
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:39,080
I'm still in the dream, but I'm still free

174
00:13:39,080 --> 00:13:43,080
I'm just asking myself if I can get past

175
00:13:43,080 --> 00:13:48,080
No matter when, no matter after

176
00:13:48,080 --> 00:13:52,080
I swear to be loyal to the end of time

177
00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:56,080
I'm afraid to be with the sky

178
00:13:56,080 --> 00:14:02,080
I just want to leave this fate behind
