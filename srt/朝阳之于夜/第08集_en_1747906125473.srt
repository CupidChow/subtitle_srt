A Splendid Life in Beijing

2
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Episode 16

3
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,000
What you said is not important.

4
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:48,000
What's important is that you are my destiny.

5
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,000
I am your destiny.

6
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,000
I am your destiny.

7
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,000
You are my destiny.

8
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:07,000
You will come back again, right?

9
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:16,000
No. I will never come back.

10
00:01:18,500 --> 00:01:20,500
Why?

11
00:01:21,500 --> 00:01:25,500
I will erase your memories

12
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:30,500
and let everything return to normal.

13
00:01:33,500 --> 00:01:37,500
No. Zhao Yao,

14
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:41,500
can you not do this?

15
00:01:50,500 --> 00:01:55,500
I will never come back.

16
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:23,500
No.

17
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:53,300
The

18
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:02,500
State Preceptor.

19
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:04,500
I am here.

20
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:11,500
I asked Ye Xun several times last night.

21
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:17,500
Do you think there is really a God in this world?

22
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:20,500
To be honest,

23
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:24,500
this is also the answer I want to know the most.

24
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:26,500
I don't know why,

25
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:30,500
but I have a strong thought in my heart.

26
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:33,500
I just want to see the God.

27
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:36,500
What Your Majesty should see now

28
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:38,500
is your subjects.

29
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:40,500
The time has come.

30
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:43,500
Your Majesty, please.

31
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:46,500
They have been waiting for a long time.

32
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:49,500
They will come for you.

33
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:53,500
You have to say

34
00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:57,500
I have a special thought.

35
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:02,500
They are waiting for you.

36
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:05,500
Don't worry.

37
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:09,500
I am here.

38
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:13,500
No!

39
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:15,500
Do it again!

40
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:18,160
ua

41
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:20,720
pe

42
00:05:32,640 --> 00:05:33,660
where

43
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:36,620
Sick

44
00:05:45,500 --> 00:05:46,180
Ye Tian?

45
00:05:48,260 --> 00:05:49,220
You still remember me?

46
00:05:51,820 --> 00:05:54,420
How is Hua Zhaoyang doing?

47
00:05:56,140 --> 00:05:57,420
Why do you remember me?

48
00:06:02,180 --> 00:06:02,820
Fix your force.

49
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:16,620
I have to save him.

50
00:06:21,100 --> 00:06:21,540
Come on,

51
00:06:21,620 --> 00:06:22,700
it's the only way for you to defend him.

52
00:06:23,060 --> 00:06:23,740
Thirdly,

53
00:06:23,740 --> 00:06:24,860
we still have no final answer.

54
00:06:37,220 --> 00:06:38,140
Get up.

55
00:06:38,740 --> 00:06:39,420
Get up.

56
00:06:42,900 --> 00:06:43,760
He's alive.

57
00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:44,440
Look.

58
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:46,440
General, you have given the order.

59
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:49,080
Anyone who has any hemorrhoids

60
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:50,640
must be brought to the General's Mansion immediately.

61
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:51,360
I see.

62
00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:52,400
I see.

63
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:00,600
Give me back my jade!

64
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:05,200
Why did you suddenly appear here

65
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:07,200
if you didn't stay in Gu Yue Sect?

66
00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:10,200
You still remember Gu Yue Sect?

67
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:12,080
General,

68
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:13,280
Doctor Ye is back.

69
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:24,560
Never mind.

70
00:07:24,760 --> 00:07:25,880
Let's use magic to get rid of the body first.

71
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:42,280
Where is my spiritual power?

72
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:54,240
It seems that

73
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:55,920
the evil thoughts of removing Doctor Ye

74
00:07:56,120 --> 00:07:58,120
are not enough to stop the birth of the Xiuluo.

75
00:07:58,360 --> 00:07:59,800
I have to continue this life.

76
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:01,240
The priority now

77
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:02,840
is to get back the Yin and Yang jade

78
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:04,040
and restore my spiritual power.

79
00:08:04,280 --> 00:08:05,920
Otherwise, I can't even get a string.

80
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:12,000
Ye Xun.

81
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:14,000
Brother.

82
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:17,200
This is the only jade you have today.

83
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:18,960
Yes.

84
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,000
Leave the rest to me.

85
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:22,000
Wait for me outside.

86
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:23,680
Okay.

87
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:10,920
Brother.

88
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:12,920
I heard that

89
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:15,320
a spy of Gu Yue Sect was caught in the city today.

90
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:37,680
Don't be so

91
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:40,720
What if he...

92
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:41,680
He is a great disciple of me.

93
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:45,520
I think he

94
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:47,280
is just a lucky object.

95
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:49,040
He is not dangerous enough.

96
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:51,760
But now there is one thing

97
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:53,440
that needs to be done by him.

98
00:09:55,960 --> 00:09:57,280
You are planning to...

99
00:09:57,920 --> 00:09:59,240
They are cultivators.

100
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:01,280
They are only thinking about the Heavenly Capital.

101
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:03,360
But at the same time, they should know

102
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:05,400
that they are also responsible for saving the lives of the people

103
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:07,480
and the fire in the water.

104
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:10,840
Yes.

105
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:23,560
Tian Du City

106
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:25,160
has been closed for three months

107
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:27,040
because of the Xiu Luo Yi.

108
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:29,040
At this time,

109
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:32,200
why did Gu Yue Sect send you here?

110
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:34,160
Xiu Luo Yi?

111
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:37,280
That means something bad is going to happen to Xiu Luo.

112
00:10:37,640 --> 00:10:39,000
What are you thinking about?

113
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,200
Shall I tell you something?

114
00:10:46,920 --> 00:10:48,040
When he was born,

115
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:50,280
the Night Sky also was going to become the Xiu Luo.

116
00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:51,600
I didn't come in time last night

117
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:52,840
to stop Xiu Luo from having an accident.

118
00:10:53,240 --> 00:10:54,980
I must know it as soon as possible

119
00:10:55,140 --> 00:10:56,260
what kinds of grudges he had.

120
00:10:58,680 --> 00:10:59,840
Just by looking at me like this,

121
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:01,000
how come?

122
00:11:02,680 --> 00:11:03,840
If I say

123
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:06,320
I came here for you,

124
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:07,720
will you believe me?

125
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:11,200
Do you think

126
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:14,200
I'll believe you now?

127
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:17,200
As the Chief General of Tian Du City,

128
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:19,200
I'm interrogating you now.

129
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:21,200
As the chief disciple of Gu Yue Sect,

130
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:23,200
you must tell me the truth.

131
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:26,200
General?

132
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:28,200
He's a general now?

133
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:35,200
Anyway,

134
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:36,200
you want to solve the problem of the Shura, right?

135
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:37,200
I can help you.

136
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:39,200
How about this?

137
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:40,200
Let me go first.

138
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:42,200
Let's talk about it openly.

139
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:43,200
Okay?

140
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:11,200
I'm here.

141
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:12,200
I'm here.

142
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:13,200
I'm here.

143
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:14,200
I'm here.

144
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:15,200
I'm here.

145
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:16,200
I'm here.

146
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:17,200
I'm here.

147
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:18,200
I'm here.

148
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:19,200
I'm here.

149
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:20,200
I'm here.

150
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:21,200
I'm here.

151
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:22,200
I'm here.

152
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:23,200
I'm here.

153
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:24,200
I'm here.

154
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:25,200
I'm here.

155
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:26,200
I'm here.

156
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:27,200
I'm here.

157
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:28,200
I'm here.

158
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:29,200
I'm here.

159
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:30,200
I'm here.

160
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:31,200
I'm here.

161
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:32,200
I'm here.

162
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:33,200
I'm here.

163
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:34,200
I'm here.

164
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:35,200
I'm here.

165
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:36,200
I'm here.

166
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:37,200
I'm here.

167
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:38,200
I'm here.

168
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:39,200
I'm here.

169
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:40,200
I'm here.

170
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:41,200
I'm here.

171
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:42,200
I'm here.

172
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:43,200
I'm here.

173
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:44,200
I'm here.

174
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:45,200
I'm here.

175
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:46,200
I'm here.

176
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:47,200
I'm here.

177
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:48,200
I'm here.

178
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:49,200
I'm here.

179
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:50,200
I'm here.

180
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:51,200
I'm here.

181
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:52,200
I'm here.

182
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:53,200
I'm here.

183
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:54,200
I'm here.

184
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:55,200
I'm here.

I'm here.

186
00:12:56,200 --> 00:12:57,200
I'm here.

187
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:58,200
I'm here.

188
00:12:58,200 --> 00:12:59,200
I'm here.

189
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:00,200
I'm here.

190
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:01,200
I'm here.

191
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:02,200
I'm here.

192
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:03,200
I'm here.

193
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:04,200
I'm here.

194
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:05,200
