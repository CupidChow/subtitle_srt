00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,760
My poor hearing

iséd for my注意

3
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:39,900

Episode avaiza

00:00:46,100 --> 00:00:48,920
New Reading

6
00:00:50,220 --> 00:00:51,040
What do you think?

7
00:00:55,040 --> 00:00:57,220
Xiaozhu precis

8
00:00:57,220 --> 00:00:58,260
��

9
00:00:58,260 --> 00:00:59,040
What?

10
00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:03,200
I have no choice.

11
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:15,060
Though Zhao Ni and Compare嘿

12
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:18,480
I have no sense in andershing.

13
00:01:19,580 --> 00:01:20,420
All right.

14
00:01:21,260 --> 00:01:23,700
Zhuangzhuang, you fall in love with somebody.

15
00:01:24,460 --> 00:01:25,840
But Li Zhixing persistent to be a couple

16
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:27,080
You taught me that?

17
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:31,040
Master.

18
00:01:31,480 --> 00:01:32,160
Master.

19
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:35,240
Ye Tian.

20
00:01:35,760 --> 00:01:36,520
Don't worry.

21
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:38,000
One day,

22
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:41,080
I'll show you

23
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:43,600
my true self in front of everyone.

24
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:45,280
You must be careful.

25
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:33,120
The

26
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:41,080
anyone sees it?

27
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:42,640
Sounds irresistibly powerful!

28
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:43,720
Me...

29
00:02:56,440 --> 00:02:57,240
Just treat me.

30
00:02:58,840 --> 00:02:59,740
Perhaps

31
00:02:59,740 --> 00:03:01,740
I can drink cup noodles.

32
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:02,740
Sure.

33
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:11,640
No, no, no.

34
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:12,540
Be afraid.

35
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:13,680
I will show you my skills.

36
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:20,080
I can wash it clean.

37
00:03:24,580 --> 00:03:25,540
Oh no.

38
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:56,960
We can work together.

39
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:03,040
==

40
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:11,240
==

41
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:12,680
Master.

42
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:13,880
What are you doing?

43
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:16,920
Watching the scenery.

44
00:04:20,540 --> 00:04:21,560
After dark,

45
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:24,720
we will escape here alone.

46
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:25,480
I...

47
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:26,920
Tell me.

48
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:27,560
I didn't say anything.

49
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:28,200
Tell me.

50
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:29,120
Come here.

51
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:30,160
I didn't say anything.

52
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:44,240
Go away.

53
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:45,240
Close the door.

54
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:51,040
Master.

55
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:53,320
Let's just fight.

56
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:55,280
Xiao Ning.

57
00:04:55,760 --> 00:04:57,600
You're teaching me how to do things?

58
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:01,920
You're torturing me here.

59
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:03,160
How about...

60
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:05,160
You're picking me up here.

61
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:06,480
How about

62
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:07,760
taking the book?

63
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:09,480
The book?

64
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:10,600
I didn't do it.

65
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:25,020
Could I be

66
00:05:25,020 --> 00:05:26,720
with you today?

67
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:28,920
I can really learn every bit of this,

68
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:30,320
when you're nearly there.

69
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:31,840
I'm afraid

70
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:33,720
you won't be Let's talk.

71
00:05:40,280 --> 00:05:41,280
What are you looking at?

72
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:42,800
Master.

73
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:44,080
I wanted to tell you

74
00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:47,120
I'm dead.

75
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:51,080
Think about it.

76
00:05:51,080 --> 00:05:53,920
I've been following you to practice sword technique.

77
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:55,520
It doesn't really matter.

78
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:57,640
I'm still a beginner.

79
00:05:58,200 --> 00:05:59,080
Right?

80
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:02,040
So,

81
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:04,000
why don't you teach me how to do it?

82
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,400
So I can follow your steps as soon as possible.

83
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:07,840
I'm like this anyway.

84
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:08,840
I've accepted my fate.

85
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:10,160
But,

86
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:12,320
I have a small request.

87
00:06:16,840 --> 00:06:19,320
You should let go of Nie Xun.

88
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:23,720
I'm the one who will take care of her.

89
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:25,240
I have to take responsibility for her.

90
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:30,720
What's the point of being such a brat?

91
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:33,360
But, if I teach her,

92
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:34,800
it's a way to

93
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:37,160
hide your sword technique.

94
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:38,320
But,

95
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:40,400
you can't hide your old man's appearance.

96
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:44,440
I'm afraid you'll have to move your stone to steal his reward.

97
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:46,440
You're so beautiful.

98
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:48,960
You're so good-looking.

99
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:52,400
Master,

100
00:06:52,640 --> 00:06:54,880
what were you having fun with?

101
00:06:57,400 --> 00:06:59,560
I think you're getting it now.

102
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:01,280
You've improved. You've improved.

103
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:02,600
I dare not.

104
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:03,880
How about this?

105
00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:05,080
I'll find you some books

106
00:07:05,080 --> 00:07:06,320
to read.

107
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:08,240
Books? I...

108
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:18,960
Take a look.

109
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:21,240
There are so many?

110
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:25,360
Taking advantage of those days,

111
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:27,560
I'll write some katast отношes to the rules

112
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:29,160
and cover with yourself.

113
00:07:29,640 --> 00:07:30,400
By then,

114
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:31,760
all the sects will become polluted.

115
00:07:31,880 --> 00:07:33,440
You'll be beheaded to execution.

116
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:36,720
That's how I run about.

117
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:50,920
But I don't know if I can go where you're accused here.

118
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,320
May I get there?

119
00:07:57,240 --> 00:07:58,860
The guard

120
00:08:01,640 --> 00:08:02,440
is here!

121
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:04,280
Be milligramIed in earlier days,

122
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:07,840
and I'm here to farther to wait.

123
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:11,680
Not sure if

124
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:14,200
you can make one or not.

125
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:17,280
I heard he won't reply at all.

126
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:18,760
I'm sure he would.

127
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:19,800
I'm sorry.

128
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:21,560
My actions are against your confession.

129
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:23,400
What confession?

130
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:25,520
Is Ye Tian really your brother?

131
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:26,920
Of course.

132
00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:29,200
Then why would he have a natural flower?

133
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:30,320
Explain it to me.

134
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:32,600
I really don't know.

135
00:08:33,040 --> 00:08:35,400
Then I suspect your true intention.

136
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:37,560
My brother and I

137
00:08:37,560 --> 00:08:39,160
are the strangers who are wandering around the Yunyou.

138
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:40,960
He's from the Flower Book.

139
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:42,040
You know that?

140
00:08:42,040 --> 00:08:43,160
Which places have you been to

141
00:08:43,160 --> 00:08:44,200
with your brother Yunyou?

142
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:48,120
Changfeng, Yunsheng,

143
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:49,120
Zhifang City.

144
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:51,280
I've been to Shanggu Yue Sect.

145
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:55,760
There's a battle in the Tiandu City in Shanshao.

146
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:57,360
It's been half a month since it started.

147
00:08:57,360 --> 00:08:58,680
So, we're here at Gu Yue Sect.

148
00:08:59,320 --> 00:09:00,520
Tiandu City?

149
00:09:00,520 --> 00:09:01,480
Which one?

150
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:02,760
Lianghe Lvdian.

151
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:03,920
You can find out.

152
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:11,360
I'll confirm it with a day.

153
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:13,480
If your experience is false,

154
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:15,560
I'll report to the master.

155
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:20,680
I'm not angry with you.

156
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:24,440
I'm not angry with you.

157
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:27,560
I'm not angry with you.

158
00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:30,360
You're just worried about your sister,

159
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:31,360
Hua Zhao Yang, right?

160
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,120
How do you know?

161
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:37,000
You forced me to

162
00:09:37,520 --> 00:09:39,120
look like my brother

163
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:39,760
and protect me.

164
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:41,320
I can see that.

165
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:43,920
I'm not angry with you.

166
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:45,240
I'm not angry with you.

167
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:46,360
I'm not angry with you.

168
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:47,560
I'm not angry with you.

169
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:49,840
Don't overestimate yourself.

170
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:57,840
I'll do it in private.

171
00:09:58,600 --> 00:10:02,240
We're here to submit my Memories of Adoration.

172
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:02,760
Don't make noelae.

173
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:09,680
If I find out the truth,

174
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,000
I'll be mistaken.

175
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:14,800
I'll apologise to you.

176
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:16,520
I can come here as long as I want.

177
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:19,000
I was afraid that my brother would break into the house

178
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:20,920
and he would be arrested.

179
00:10:21,640 --> 00:10:23,040
I'd better take this opportunity.

180
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:24,560
What do you mean?

181
00:10:25,520 --> 00:10:26,960
You're interested in the repair of the house, too.

182
00:10:29,080 --> 00:10:30,160
I'm not interested at all.

183
00:10:33,640 --> 00:10:34,560
I just

184
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:37,960
want to protect my brother.

185
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:39,640
I don't want to drag him down.

186
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:47,320
About Trick or Trick often known as

187
00:10:47,640 --> 00:10:48,640
trick or trick...

188
00:10:57,560 --> 00:10:57,820
You knew?

189
00:10:58,080 --> 00:10:58,860
part appearance

190
00:10:59,460 --> 00:11:00,980
and you were able to play pepper,

191
00:11:02,140 --> 00:11:03,060
that's a great explanation.

192
00:11:05,260 --> 00:11:06,420
If someone knows

193
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:08,960
Gu Yue Sect's chief female disciple

194
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:10,740
was this 21 Movemable Odyssey,

195
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:11,520
indeed,

196
00:11:11,520 --> 00:11:12,560
Pet you up.

197
00:11:13,060 --> 00:11:13,640
It…

198
00:11:15,880 --> 00:11:16,600
Hey!

199
00:11:16,980 --> 00:11:18,160
Why did you fall in?

200
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:34,560
I even failed

201
00:11:41,520 --> 00:11:42,240
Yanyan,

202
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:44,320
where did he go?

203
00:11:46,580 --> 00:11:47,020
This...

204
00:12:11,520 --> 00:12:13,520
I'm not afraid of the wind, I'm afraid of the wind

205
00:12:13,520 --> 00:12:15,520
I'm afraid of the wind, I'm afraid of the wind

206
00:12:15,520 --> 00:12:17,520
I'm afraid of the wind, I'm afraid of the wind

207
00:12:17,520 --> 00:12:19,520
I'm afraid of the wind, I'm afraid of the wind

208
00:12:19,520 --> 00:12:21,520
I'm afraid of the wind, I'm afraid of the wind

209
00:12:21,520 --> 00:12:23,520
I'm afraid of the wind, I'm afraid of the wind

210
00:12:23,520 --> 00:12:25,520
I'm afraid of the wind, I'm afraid of the wind

211
00:12:25,520 --> 00:12:27,520
I'm afraid of the wind, I'm afraid of the wind

212
00:12:27,520 --> 00:12:29,520
I'm afraid of the wind, I'm afraid of the wind

213
00:12:29,520 --> 00:12:31,520
I'm afraid of the wind, I'm afraid of the wind

214
00:12:31,520 --> 00:12:33,520

215
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:35,520
I'm afraid of the wind, I'm afraid of the wind

216
00:12:35,520 --> 00:12:37,520
I'm afraid of the wind, I'm afraid of the wind

217
00:12:37,520 --> 00:12:39,520
I'm afraid of the wind, I'm afraid of the wind

218
00:12:39,520 --> 00:12:47,520
While the flowers in it are full of winds and shoots, why are the characters wild?

219
00:12:47,520 --> 00:12:52,760
From the time we saw each other in Badassорui, he was walking

220
00:12:53,080 --> 00:12:57,520
creamy charcoal cooking which we might drink from

221
00:12:57,700 --> 00:13:02,660
Before the wind and the wind were moving fast

222
00:13:03,180 --> 00:13:06,620
My wish is that everyiąty of the page part of my mind
