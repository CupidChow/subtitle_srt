Episode 34

3
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:53,520
This war has beenuckles for 100 years!

4
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,420
Do I have to walk this same road through the來說?

5
00:01:55,880 --> 00:01:57,080
Heaven, Nameless.

6
00:01:58,200 --> 00:01:59,760
Have you lost your memory?

7
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:01,280
Why are you doing this?

8
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:08,760
I want you to pay for this.

9
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:19,040
You bastard!

10
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:21,960
Ye Tian.

11
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:24,160
Don't touch me.

12
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:31,080
I'll pay for this.

13
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:33,160
I'll pay for this.

14
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:34,960
I'll pay for this.

15
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:36,160
I'll pay for this.

16
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:37,560
I'll pay for this.

17
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:38,960
I'll pay for this.

18
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:40,360
I'll pay for this.

19
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:41,760
I'll pay for this.

20
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:43,160
I'll pay for this.

21
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:44,360
I'll pay for this.

22
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:45,760
I'll pay for this.

23
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:47,160
I'll pay for this.

24
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:48,360
I'll pay for this.

25
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:49,560
I'll pay for this.

26
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:50,760
I'll pay for this.

27
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:52,160
I'll pay for this.

28
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:53,360
I'll pay for this.

29
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:54,760
I'll pay for this.

30
00:02:54,760 --> 00:02:56,160
I'll pay for this.

31
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:57,360
I'll pay for this.

32
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:58,560
I'll pay for this.

33
00:02:58,560 --> 00:02:59,560
I'll pay for this.

34
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:00,560
I'll pay for this.

35
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:03,560
You know

36
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:06,560
everything is useless to me.

37
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:09,560
It's useless to me.

38
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:12,560
It's all my fault.

39
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:13,560
No.

40
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:17,960
You were right.

41
00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:20,760
I was right.

42
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:23,960
Unfortunately,

43
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:26,560
you have some more doubts.

44
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:29,560
It's my fault.

45
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:32,560
I'm not good enough to learn from you.

46
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:36,560
I'm not good enough to come to this ancient month

47
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:39,560
and make Zhao Yang die.

48
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:41,560
I'm not good enough to learn from you.

49
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:42,560
I'm getting more and more

50
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:46,560
and more obsessed with it.

51
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:49,560
Grand Master,

52
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:52,560
why does the flower of the sky grow on me?

53
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:55,560
Then why did Zhao Yang

54
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:57,560
suddenly feel affection for you

55
00:03:57,560 --> 00:03:59,560
and still can't stop it?

56
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:07,560
I don't know.

57
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:12,560
Maybe the answer to these two questions

58
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:15,560
is hidden together.

59
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:26,560
It's really cruel to hide it.

60
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:54,560
Eat something.

61
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:58,560
You don't have to take the money to trap me.

62
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:00,560
I don't want to leave.

63
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:05,560
Maybe

64
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:09,560
my brother and I didn't come to the ancient month.

65
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:12,560
I hate myself for not being capable.

66
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:15,560
I can only watch

67
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:17,560
the destruction of Su Ming and my brother.

68
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:19,560
I'm the same.

69
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:24,560
When will he wake up?

70
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:50,560
Do you really have the confidence?

71
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:54,560
This is the only way.

72
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:57,560
We must try.

73
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:01,560
I'm really worried.

74
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:03,560
But I also know

75
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:06,560
there's no point in worrying about it.

76
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:09,560
We can only choose to believe in the power of the cultivation.

77
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:13,560
Even if it brings the consequences of the cure.

78
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:15,560
It's bad luck.

79
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:17,560
It's bad luck

80
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:20,560
to let the nature become the flower of the cultivation.

81
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:23,560
But I can feel

82
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:25,560
that this power

83
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:27,560
didn't change because of me.

84
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:30,560
I transferred the power to him.

85
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:31,560
He should have no regrets.

86
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:34,560
Maybe

87
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:37,560
he will also become the real nature

88
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:39,560
because of this power.

89
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:47,560
And he became the nature.

90
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:49,560
It's the only way to cure him

91
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:51,560
and awaken him.

92
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:54,560
It's also the only way

93
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:56,560
to end this epidemic.

94
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:17,560
What's going on?

95
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:20,560
My body

96
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:22,560
can't control it.

97
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:27,560
Is it because

98
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:30,560
you constantly transferred the power to Hua Chaoyang?

99
00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:33,560
If one day

100
00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:36,560
we can't control this situation,

101
00:08:37,560 --> 00:08:39,560
what will happen?

102
00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:42,560
Are you afraid that it will affect us

103
00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:43,560
and affect him?

104
00:08:45,560 --> 00:08:46,560
If the cultivation is over,

105
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:49,560
the situation will be very bad.

106
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:55,560
Where is Hua Chaoyang?

107
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:00,560
I will leave enough power to him.

108
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:04,560
That's not a worry.

109
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:06,560
I can't stop you.

110
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:10,560
When are you going to transfer the power?

111
00:09:15,560 --> 00:09:16,560
Tonight.

112
00:09:23,560 --> 00:09:25,560
I don't need your apology.

113
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:28,560
I hope you can teach me a lesson.

114
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:30,560
What do you mean?

115
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:32,560
You are interested in the cultivation.

116
00:09:33,560 --> 00:09:35,560
I'm not interested.

117
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:37,560
I just want

118
00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:41,560
to protect Huo Ke.

119
00:09:41,560 --> 00:09:42,560
I don't want to burden him.

120
00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:47,560
I don't want to burden him.

121
00:09:47,560 --> 00:09:49,560
I won't let him.

122
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:51,560
I can't stand him anymore.

123
00:09:51,560 --> 00:09:53,560
I can't stand him anymore.

124
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:56,560
I can't stand him anymore.

125
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:07,560
Brother.

126
00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:08,560
Ye Xun.

127
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:12,560
Everything is settled.

128
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:13,720
I'm going to let you go.

129
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:18,200
You know that

130
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:20,560
since the day we got married,

131
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:22,400
I've been leaving and leaving.

132
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:24,600
It's not like Gu Yue Sect said it.

133
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:28,320
That's why I'm staying here.

134
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:31,160
It's all because of him.

135
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:34,320
You're right.

136
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:36,080
They can't stop you.

137
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:41,240
But now,

138
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,680
I can't cure him.

139
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:45,320
So,

140
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:47,440
we can't leave.

141
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:54,400
What?

142
00:10:57,400 --> 00:10:58,680
Are you really afraid of me?

143
00:11:00,280 --> 00:11:00,960
I...

144
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:07,160
I'm in a relationship with Master.

145
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:09,320
Are you talking about Gu Yue Sect?

146
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:12,440
Don't you have a relationship?

147
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:21,880
Okay.

148
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:25,480
Then you can stay here.

149
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:26,840
In case...

150
00:11:34,520 --> 00:11:36,880
Can you die tonight?

151
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:40,600
I'm leaving.

152
00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:41,720
You...

153
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:43,320
Take good care of yourself.

154
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:02,120
I'm sorry.

155
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:06,160
It doesn't mean I can't go back.

156
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:07,160
I...

157
00:12:08,040 --> 00:12:09,200
It did nothing.

158
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:10,320
I'm sorry, brother.

159
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:14,320
I'm sorry.

160
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:17,320
I'm sorry.

161
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:20,320
I'm sorry.

162
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:22,320
I'm sorry.

163
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:10,320
I'm sorry.

164
00:13:39,320 --> 00:13:40,320
I'm sorry.
