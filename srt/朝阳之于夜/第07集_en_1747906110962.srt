00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,000
A Splendid Life in Beijing

2
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Episode 30

3
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Make a choice now.

4
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Either you take me back to the palace

5
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
to stabilize my life

6
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,000
and find a good plan.

7
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Or

8
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
you take me back to the palace

9
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
to stabilize my life

10
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,000
and find a good plan.

11
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Or

12
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
you take me back to the palace

13
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,000
and kill me

14
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:05,000
for the sake of the people.

15
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
It's dawn.

16
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Have you made up your mind?

17
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,000
I can't tell you

18
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
how much I've suffered.

19
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
But I know one simple thing.

20
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
You shouldn't be the only one

21
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,000
who suffers.

22
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
I've come too late.

23
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,000
I'm sorry.

24
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Ye Tian.

25
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,000
I'll come

26
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,000
as soon as possible.

27
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,000
I'll do my best

28
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
to stop all the tragedies

29
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,000
in your life.

30
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
This is

31
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Iron Man's Flower.

32
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
You don't need the Xiu Luo Sword anymore.

33
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
You're lying to me.

34
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,000
So

35
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,000
you don't have

36
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
a plan to poison the city, right?

37
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Before this,

38
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,000
it's always been my plan

39
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,000
to poison the city.

40
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,000
My hatred

41
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,000
is real.

42
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,000
When did you give up

43
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
this plan?

44
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Right here.

45
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
When you used the Sky Flower

46
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,000
to kill me.

47
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,000
I've always been

48
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,000
honest with my father.

49
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,000
But your appearance

50
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,000
made me look forward

51
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,000
to the next day.

52
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
What about your life?

53
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Just now,

54
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
the Sky Flower

55
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
returned to my body.

56
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
I'm fine now.

57
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
But you know

58
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
your own evil thoughts.

59
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,000
I'm just

60
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:10,840
pushing the

61
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Ye Tian.

62
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
I have to leave.

63
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
I have to return to the Sky Sky

64
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
and become a human.

65
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
This is my mission.

66
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
I understand.

67
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
The Heavens have their own responsibilities.

68
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,000
You just need to

69
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
come back often.

70
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Ye Tian,

71
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
you don't understand.

72
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
I have to erase

73
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
all the memories

74
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
of me.

75
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Including you.

76
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,860
13 unique times

77
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:06,000
She's leaving.

78
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Is on coming.

79
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Yes?

80
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Right.

81
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
I also have

82
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
the call of adhesive growth

83
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,300
and hold a

84
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,000
acids revival idea.

85
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:23,760
is more than that.

86
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:25,920
This manual

87
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:27,760
records the content of Tianran's cultivation.

88
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:29,840
It should be helpful to you.

89
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:31,680
Yes.

90
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:38,240
I didn't expect

91
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:40,240
you were like this back then.

92
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:44,720
I turned the ancient book

93
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:46,400
that Master wrote back then.

94
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:48,520
You are free to leave now.

95
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:50,300
Tianran,

96
00:05:50,980 --> 00:05:52,140
are you ready to leave?

97
00:05:57,760 --> 00:05:58,220
By the way,

98
00:05:59,180 --> 00:06:00,100
before you started practising,

99
00:06:00,420 --> 00:06:02,140
as the Minister of State,

100
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:03,400
you saw Liu hot to go.

101
00:06:04,620 --> 00:06:06,060
Arrange it well for me in details.

102
00:06:06,780 --> 00:06:07,600
Yes.

103
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:10,340
You want to open up this Mountain to establish your sect,

104
00:06:11,100 --> 00:06:12,680
have you thought about your name?

105
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:14,800
I should look on gifts

106
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:16,340
so as to be tÃ¤ Sau.

107
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:20,360
Please don't talk about the meeting.

108
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,000
There is a pharmacy in the south of the city

109
00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:26,840
called Gu Yue Village.

110
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:29,160
It's the place where I first met him.

111
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:31,880
Why don't we go there to name it Gu Yue Village?

112
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:48,480
Are you really leaving?

113
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:52,480
Hua Zhao Yang.

114
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:56,240
Why are you leaving?

115
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:58,120
You've already gotten rid of

116
00:06:58,120 --> 00:06:59,400
the evil thoughts in my brother's body.

117
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:01,360
There won't be any more Xiuluo, right?

118
00:07:02,520 --> 00:07:03,200
What?

119
00:07:03,760 --> 00:07:05,640
You're not afraid that I'll take your brother away now?

120
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:08,920
I just can't figure it out.

121
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:10,640
I've told you.

122
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:13,880
There are too many ugly and evil things in this world.

123
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:15,920
Only the evil things can be taken away.

124
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:17,880
Only a person like Zhao Yang

125
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:20,040
can save the lost people.

126
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:26,200
Where is Ye Tian?

127
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:29,120
He said he's waiting for you in the yard.

128
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:47,120
I'll go.

129
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:01,920
Zhao Yang.

130
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:04,640
I know

131
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:06,880
I can't keep you.

132
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:11,760
But you should understand

133
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:13,480
my feelings for you.

134
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:15,960
I like you.

135
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:17,880
I understand.

136
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:21,440
But actually, I don't know

137
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:23,520
what is love.

138
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:31,080
I thought

139
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:32,440
my life

140
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:34,760
would live in the darkness forever.

141
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:38,480
All these things are piled up together.

142
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:40,720
It's like a eternal night.

143
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:43,240
It's more like a prison.

144
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:48,120
Until the moment you appeared,

145
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:51,680
you shined me like a ray of light.

146
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,680
You made me feel

147
00:08:57,680 --> 00:08:59,000
what love is for the first time.

148
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:02,160
You always said

149
00:09:02,680 --> 00:09:04,440
you saved me with the Heavenly Flower.

150
00:09:06,280 --> 00:09:07,440
But for me,

151
00:09:09,160 --> 00:09:10,760
you're my Heavenly Flower.

152
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:17,440
Ye Tian.

153
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:21,640
Do you believe in destiny?

154
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:27,640
You're destined to fall into the abyss.

155
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:29,920
You're destined to

156
00:09:30,760 --> 00:09:32,320
have all these things happen to me.

157
00:09:36,280 --> 00:09:37,920
Master once told me

158
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:40,840
that destiny

159
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:43,200
is accompanied by regret.

160
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:45,320
I didn't know

161
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:46,920
what it meant.

162
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:49,520
But after you saved me,

163
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:51,560
I had to leave.

164
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:55,200
I felt

165
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:58,400
deep regret.

166
00:09:58,400 --> 00:09:59,840
I felt deep regret.

167
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:30,400
The End

168
00:10:43,640 --> 00:10:44,840
What you said

169
00:10:45,560 --> 00:10:46,640
is not important.

170
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:49,040
What's important is

171
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:52,920
you're destined to be mine.

172
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:56,120
You'll

173
00:10:56,840 --> 00:10:58,200
come back.

174
00:10:59,160 --> 00:10:59,960
Right?

175
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:06,000
No.

176
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:08,920
I'll never come back.

177
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:32,880
The sun and the moon are like white hands.

178
00:11:33,160 --> 00:11:36,640
We'll never see each other again.

179
00:11:37,520 --> 00:11:41,600
The summer is heavy and the spring is cold.

180
00:11:41,720 --> 00:11:45,800
The moon is in the red autumn.

181
00:11:46,040 --> 00:11:50,080
The phoenix and the phoenix are together.

182
00:11:50,360 --> 00:11:54,200
The moon and the moon are like a pair.

183
00:11:54,520 --> 00:11:56,880
The rain is like a beautiful flower.

184
00:11:56,920 --> 00:11:59,040
The wine is like a glass of wine.

185
00:11:59,160 --> 00:12:04,200
When I'm drunk, when will I stop?

186
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:09,440
The moon is like a beautiful flower.

187
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:13,640
Why do I have to live in the wind?

188
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:16,400
I'm still in the desert.

189
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:18,600
I'm free.

190
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:22,640
I ask myself if I can get through it.

191
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:27,200
I don't care about the past and the future.

192
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:31,320
I pray that I can live to the end of time.

193
00:12:31,520 --> 00:12:35,680
I'm afraid that I'll be with the heaven.

194
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:41,680
I just want to keep my name.
