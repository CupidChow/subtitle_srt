1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
Is it right or wrong?

2
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Is it good or bad?

3
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Let's meet again in the end.

4
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Episode 1

5
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Episode 1

6
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Episode 1

7
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Episode 1

8
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Didn't you say that as long as you enter my city,

9
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
you will find my secret message?

10
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
Will this end?

11
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Did you find it?

12
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
How can I save the people?

13
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
They are now one after another.

14
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
One after another.

15
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:20,000
But I can't just watch them disappear

16
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,000
again and again.

17
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
I thought that

18
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000
it was the flower that saved your life.

19
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:38,000
But it turned into the flower you were longing for.

20
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:44,000
If the ending of the story is my fault,

21
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
will you hate me?

22
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Episode 1

23
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Sometimes,

24
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:02,000
I really can't understand what you are talking about.

25
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:06,000
But this time, I'm begging you.

26
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,000
I can't tell you.

27
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
This is my own business.

28
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
I can't do anything about it.

29
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Hua Zhao Ying,

30
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,000
you are a natural.

31
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,000
You are the only one who can...

32
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,000
But I don't want to be a dog-fist anymore.

33
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Hua Rong Yue, what are you doing?

34
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
You still have the evil spirit.

35
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,000
I need to clean it up.

36
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Stop!

37
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,000
How can I clean it up?

38
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Did you kill him or not?

39
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
I just made a move.

40
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Zhao Yang,

41
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:59,000
you did your job but I'm looking for you.

42
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
I'm afraid that you would come to Tian Du City

43
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,000
to investigate Xiu Luo Yi's situation.

44
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
You are here

45
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
so desperately.

46
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,080
Are you here for something?

47
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:10,560
In the city,

48
00:03:13,640 --> 00:03:15,040
you want to win over other's growth.

49
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:16,760
So you come here

50
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:18,120
and make the decision.

51
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:20,720
This is your only choice.

52
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:25,040
If you have any questions,

53
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:27,040
go to the actual meeting room and ask Master.

54
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:29,640
ologiae.

55
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:30,680
Please.

56
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:31,800
I will try.

57
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:35,720
Then you can answer my case.

58
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
I don't understand your behavior in the ancient moon Sect.

59
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:40,000
Now that Xiu Luo Yi is in the world,

60
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:42,000
you have a strong and capable person like me

61
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:44,000
but never help each other.

62
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:48,000
Our Xiu Zhen people do have a strong and capable person.

63
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:49,400
Have you ever thought about it?

64
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
If my inner heart is completely destroyed by evil thoughts

65
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:54,000
and becomes the patient of Xiu Luo Yi,

66
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
then who else in this world can stop me?

67
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,000
If I am also infected by Xiu Luo Yi,

68
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:05,000
if the person in the ancient moon Sect's cultivation is infected,

69
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
not only is it your promise,

70
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:11,000
but also the whole world

71
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:13,000
will not have any other person like me.

72
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
I will not be able to help you.

73
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
I will not be able to help you.

74
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
I will not be able to help you.

75
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
I will not be able to help you.

76
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
The whole world

77
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:30,000
has no other place to be infected.

78
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
This is the reason why I never leave the mountain with my master.

79
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Because at this moment,

80
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,000
we can't solve Xiu Luo Yi's problem.

81
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
We can only wait for him.

82
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
I am the person you are waiting for.

83
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
You are not the flower-shaped medicine I know.

84
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,000
That's right.

85
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,000
I am the natural person you are looking for.

86
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,000
I didn't expect

87
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,000
I would still be waiting.

88
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,000
When I saw you,

89
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,000
I felt you were a great doctor.

90
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
I took you and your sister back to the mountain.

91
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
I was so worried.

92
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,000
I was so worried.

93
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
I took you and your sister back to the valley.

94
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,000
I was so worried that

95
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,000
you would be the natural person.

96
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
I didn't expect I would be waiting.

97
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:42,000
You should be coming back from the afterlife.

98
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,000
The afterlife?

99
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
No, I am not.

100
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,000
I was thinking

101
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,900
to make your sister forget

102
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,000
this General Ye Tian,

103
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,000
but lost a lot of power.

104
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,000
It seems

105
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
we both know that.

106
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,000
So,

107
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,000
the flower-shaped medicine

108
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Do you always

109
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:17,760
want to ask about the cause of this?

110
00:06:18,760 --> 00:06:19,560
Of course.

111
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:21,240
I can tell you

112
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:22,680
what happened

113
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:25,560
with his feelings.

114
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:27,040
Master, can you tell me

115
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:28,640
what happened

116
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:30,560
between me and Ye Tian?

117
00:06:36,280 --> 00:06:37,160
You...

118
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:39,440
Ye Tian.

119
00:06:40,320 --> 00:06:41,000
Ye Tian.

120
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,600
How long are you going to keep this a secret?

121
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:49,320
I care about Ye Tian's life.

122
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:51,760
Ye Tian is born.

123
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:54,400
He's already dead.

124
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:56,160
But I don't want to forget him.

125
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:01,200
Master has saved him once.

126
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:02,520
He gave you the choice.

127
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:04,000
He knows

128
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:05,240
you're the only one

129
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:06,760
who can become a disciple of God.

130
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:08,840
But you're not in love.

131
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:10,520
You're always against

132
00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:11,720
the sect and the heaven.

133
00:07:12,260 --> 00:07:12,780
Ye Tian.

134
00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:14,940
You've stood up to it

135
00:07:14,940 --> 00:07:16,160
for attending Cuckoos' edict.

136
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:26,360
Zheng Yang.

137
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:29,280
Be not too worried.

138
00:07:29,880 --> 00:07:30,840
You only need to worship God

139
00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:31,160
and save more people.

140
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:40,640
This is thekt steel body.

141
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:12,640
I will never let you go.

142
00:08:12,640 --> 00:08:16,040
Master! Master! Master!

143
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:19,640
Can you save Ye Tian again? Master!

144
00:08:19,640 --> 00:08:21,640
Master!

145
00:08:21,640 --> 00:08:23,640
Master!

146
00:08:23,640 --> 00:08:28,640
Didn't you say that your Taoist and Ye Tian's names are all the same?

147
00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:30,640
Maybe this is the fate of Ming Ming.

148
00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:34,640
Can't you just watch the sky and save Ye Tian again?

149
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:37,640
Master, I beg you. Master!

150
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:42,640
I indeed could save her again.

151
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:50,640
But Hua Zhao Yang, you know who I am.

152
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:11,640
Master.

153
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:18,640
I have feelings for Ye Tian.

154
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:23,640
But I will stop loving me.

155
00:09:25,640 --> 00:09:30,640
For this matter, you know it better than I do.

156
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:34,640
Just like he is the prince.

157
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:42,640
If you don't become a natural, I will still find you.

158
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:47,640
You are the only hope to fight against the falling.

159
00:09:49,640 --> 00:09:54,640
Zhao Yang, you can blame me.

160
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:59,640
You can also do whatever you want.

161
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:09,640
Master, I won't blame you.

162
00:10:15,640 --> 00:10:20,640
I have made my choice.

163
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:38,640
I will not blame you.

164
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:42,640
I will not blame you.

165
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:46,640
I will not blame you.

166
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:50,640
I will not blame you.

167
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:54,640
I will not blame you.

168
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:58,640
I will not blame you.

169
00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:02,640
I will not blame you.

170
00:11:03,640 --> 00:11:06,640
I see.

171
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:11,640
I am sorry. I was wrong.

172
00:11:11,640 --> 00:11:13,640
I am sorry.

173
00:11:13,640 --> 00:11:16,640
You can't choose.

174
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:20,640
I am really helpless.

175
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:24,640
But now, I feel better.

176
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:31,640
He chose to forget me because of me.

177
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:34,640
I have no reason to blame him.

178
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:36,640
You can think like this.

179
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:40,640
I am the one who want to see him the most.

180
00:11:43,640 --> 00:11:48,640
Tianran, how to get rid of Xiu Luo Yi?

181
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:51,640
That is the most important thing.

182
00:11:51,640 --> 00:11:55,640
Actually, master doesn't want to do that.

183
00:11:55,640 --> 00:11:59,640
The plan is to make a plan.

184
00:11:59,640 --> 00:12:01,640
Since you know the consequence,

185
00:12:01,640 --> 00:12:05,640
tell us what to do.

186
00:12:05,640 --> 00:12:09,640
Since I am the master,

187
00:12:09,640 --> 00:12:13,640
the best choice is to cut me off.

188
00:12:13,640 --> 00:12:16,640
No.

189
00:12:19,640 --> 00:12:24,640
