1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:30,920
Your Majesty

2
00:00:31,040 --> 00:00:32,160
If people were to run away from here

3
00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:34,200
who Wudu Crush should have gone toDoesn't matter

4
00:00:36,400 --> 00:00:38,360
But the people will find an excuse

5
00:00:38,440 --> 00:00:39,760
to shoot out of town

6
00:00:39,880 --> 00:00:40,560
All of this

7
00:00:41,560 --> 00:00:59,840
because we are

8
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:01,600
What?

9
00:01:01,880 --> 00:01:03,560
Why are you acting so strange today?

10
00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:04,760
What about you?

11
00:01:05,800 --> 00:01:06,880
Is it because

12
00:01:07,120 --> 00:01:09,480
you have a heavy feeling in your heart?

13
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,080
That's why you're acting like this?

14
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:14,560
Ye Tian.

15
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:16,920
If you keep talking to me in this tone,

16
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:18,160
I'll punish you.

17
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:24,280
Just let your heart be in your heart.

18
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:25,520
Get lost!

19
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,040
If this posture

20
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:34,440
can make you feel comfortable,

21
00:01:35,160 --> 00:01:36,040
I'm willing to do it.

22
00:01:38,080 --> 00:01:39,000
I'm warning you.

23
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:40,680
Don't use your

24
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:42,920
script to act with me.

25
00:01:43,160 --> 00:01:44,120
I'm not acting.

26
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:46,960
Zhao Yang, stop acting.

27
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:50,080
Your thoughts about me

28
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:52,720
have been expressed

29
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:54,040
through the ink last night.

30
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:56,400
What...

31
00:01:56,800 --> 00:01:58,000
What did I say?

32
00:02:00,160 --> 00:02:02,720
You've been calling my name in your dream.

33
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:05,000
I'm just saying.

34
00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:06,360
You like me.

35
00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:13,240
But now,

36
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:15,200
everything is clear.

37
00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:16,560
Think about it.

38
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:19,080
You're so bad at teaching.

39
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:20,840
You must call me your disciple.

40
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:22,680
You said you...

41
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:24,360
Shut up.

42
00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:25,640
So,

43
00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:27,760
you want me to stay by your side.

44
00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:29,840
Actually,

45
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:31,400
I'm willing to do it.

46
00:02:31,880 --> 00:02:33,040
If you keep being like this,

47
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:34,960
I'll be rude to you.

48
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:38,000
How can you be rude to me?

49
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:39,720
You want me to kneel down every day?

50
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:42,280
Try it.

51
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:47,000
Is it the flame of love?

52
00:02:58,200 --> 00:02:59,640
I still don't get it.

53
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:01,920
I practise on the mountain.

54
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:04,680
Why do I need to put on these sparkling clothes?

55
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:16,800
Techniques Return to Everything мой

56
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:20,320

00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:26,960
ös

58
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:31,160
Everyone knows that the heaven and earth are the same.

59
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:35,240
Are you reading?

60
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:36,920
No.

61
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:40,440
You're weird.

62
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:43,440
Did Master ask you to do that?

63
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:45,160
Absolutely not.

64
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:46,200
Tell me the truth.

65
00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:48,040
I...

66
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:50,040
You're pretending to be a fool. I'll throw you down.

67
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:51,120
Meng Yue.

68
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:54,360
Master.

69
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:56,080
It's strange.

70
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:00,760
Why do you feel the spirit of heaven and earth

71
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:04,040
is one step above your usual level?

72
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:09,440
Don't you feel it?

73
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:13,800
Ye Xun.

74
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:16,400
What's wrong with your master?

75
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:19,240
Master.

76
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:21,560
Can't you see it?

77
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:25,920
I'm old.

78
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:28,160
I'm old and confused.

79
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:30,600
I can't see it clearly.

80
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:32,480
Good job.

81
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:33,920
Keep practicing.

82
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:43,120
It's really useful.

83
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,440
I don't know.

84
00:04:46,760 --> 00:04:48,360
But Master said it's useful.

85
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:50,320
It must be useful.

86
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:53,680
Then...

87
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:55,880
Am I pretty?

88
00:04:56,200 --> 00:04:56,920
So what?

89
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:58,720
Is there anyone byćuse of your life because of this?

90
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:01,040
Why do you cheat me?

91
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:08,040
You're pretty.

92
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:11,560
All right.

93
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:14,720
If you find yourself in a difficult position,

94
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:16,400
check it on me.

95
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:18,760
Okay.

96
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:28,480
people will look at me the way they like

97
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:30,080
and think about men the way they think

98
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:33,320
while they shifts their minds as they seek After the rest in a different direction

99
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:34,800
you become ground- neat

100
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:37,260
Finally I also

101
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:45,800
Master, you asked for me

102
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:49,960
You came asking me

103
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:52,000
how's our cultivation

104
00:05:52,840 --> 00:05:53,920
To answer your master

105
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:56,320
I don't mean to run away.

106
00:05:58,080 --> 00:05:59,400
It's one thing to run away,

107
00:05:59,640 --> 00:06:02,320
but it's another thing to praise Master.

108
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:03,640
It's irrelevant.

109
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:06,160
You're honest.

110
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:10,840
Master,

111
00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:13,120
when did you teach me the Fire Flame Temple?

112
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:18,040
Zhao Yang,

113
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:20,400
do you know what's most important

114
00:06:20,640 --> 00:06:22,120
to teach your disciples?

115
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:24,720
What?

116
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:26,360
Patience.

117
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:28,360
Master,

118
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:30,680
I can't stand it at all.

119
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:34,160
It's harder than the training.

120
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:35,960
It's much harder.

121
00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:37,560
The back of my teeth

122
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:39,560
that I get angry every day is going to break.

123
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:43,160
You have to do it yourself

124
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:46,000
to get out of the pain as soon as possible.

125
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:47,720
Master is right.

126
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:49,560
You have to do it yourself to teach me.

127
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:50,760
That's more efficient.

128
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:51,720
Right, Master?

129
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:53,840
Yes.

130
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:55,040
Okay.

131
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:57,720
Then I'll teach you

132
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:01,400
the Ice-Cold Skill today.

133
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:14,560
Master.

134
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:15,720
Stay away from me.

135
00:07:16,760 --> 00:07:17,400
Master.

136
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:19,880
Master.

137
00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:21,760
Master.

138
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:23,400
Can you stop bothering me?

139
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:28,760
And don't be too affectionate.

140
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:32,400
How can I be affectionate?

141
00:07:32,760 --> 00:07:34,920
You're the one who changed my name in my dream.

142
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:36,760
I heard it clearly.

143
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:41,000
Even if you're telling the truth,

144
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:42,760
how do you know I didn't beat you

145
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:44,400
in your dream?

146
00:07:46,520 --> 00:07:47,520
Woman.

147
00:07:48,520 --> 00:07:51,680
Is it possible that I'm really interested in her?

148
00:07:52,840 --> 00:07:53,840
Impossible.

149
00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:55,320
Impossible.

150
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:01,160
You're a monster.

151
00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:07,120
You're going to be a monster tonight.

152
00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:19,760
—Mo Yuan—

153
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:25,760
The sun and the moon come in silver

154
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:29,560
The end will be at hand

155
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:33,080
Sand islingened with the star

156
00:08:33,160 --> 00:08:34,640
Summer is 보는

157
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:38,440
Spring da Wellen

158
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:42,880
Keep your eyes on the yellows

159
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:47,120
See the blood paste

160
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:20,360
I don't ask about the future

161
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:24,360
I swear to live to the end of time

162
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:28,840
Forgive me for being bold and in the same dream with heaven

163
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:34,680
I only want to keep this fate

164
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:52,120
I only want to keep this fate

165
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:14,120
What happened just now?

166
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:16,120
I don't know

167
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:20,120
But I think

168
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:25,120
I have a lot of memories about you in my mind

169
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:29,120
No wonder

170
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:33,120
You always called my name in the dream

171
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:37,120
And I

172
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:41,120
I seem to have an unknown love for you all the time

173
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:44,120
On the surface

174
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:46,120
I came to Gu Yue Sect to get the money

175
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:49,120
But it seems like

176
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:51,120
It's very likely that it's fate that God arranged

177
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:53,120
Let us meet again

178
00:10:57,120 --> 00:10:58,120
Master

179
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:02,120
Don't you always want to leave Gu Yue Sect?

180
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:07,120
Let's do it together tonight

181
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:19,120
Ok

182
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:48,120
I'm here

183
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:49,120
I'm here

184
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:50,120
I'm here

185
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:51,120
I'm here

186
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:52,120
I'm here

187
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:53,120
I'm here

188
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:54,120
I'm here

189
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:55,120
I'm here

190
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:56,120
I'm here

191
00:11:56,120 --> 00:11:57,120
I'm here

192
00:11:57,120 --> 00:11:58,120
I'm here

193
00:11:58,120 --> 00:11:59,120
I'm here

194
