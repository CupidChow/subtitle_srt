1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:39,000
I don't know if I can meet you in my dream

2
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Episode 20

3
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:56,000
If I hurt you in the ending of the story,

4
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,000
would you hate me?

5
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,000
You should have told me.

6
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,000
I'm not a fool.

7
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,000
I'm not a fool.

8
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,000
I'm not a fool.

9
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,000
I'm not a fool.

10
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,000
I'm not a fool.

11
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,000
I'm not a fool.

12
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,000
I'm not a fool.

13
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,000
You're the one who saved my life.

14
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
It's worth it.

15
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Why did I lose my memory?

16
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Did something happen?

17
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,000
I want to make it clear.

18
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Why did you have a obsession?

19
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Why did you travel with me after you've left?

20
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,000
I was careless.

21
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
There are many memories in life.

22
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,000
I don't know why

23
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:30,920
has the little thing left for you

24
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:33,960
in the heart ofapolis ever been so vague.

25
00:02:46,900 --> 00:02:47,620
Hua Zhuo Yang,

26
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:52,920
I liked you, right?

27
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,000
What do you like?

28
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:09,680
I only remember

29
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:13,520
I left a mark on this book.

30
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:15,800
To restore memory,

31
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:18,080
I asked you.

32
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:26,960
Ye Tian,

33
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
let's go out and see the starry sky.

34
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
There is only one last memory left.

35
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,000
In this garden,

36
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,000
under this starry sky.

37
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Okay.

38
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
After you finish talking,

39
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
I can leave safely.

40
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,000
You know that

41
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
I only have a thousand years

42
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
to live with the flower of Bian.

43
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
I only want to wait for you.

44
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
And I only want to wait for you.

45
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
You have helped me to solve the problem.

46
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,000
I can leave now.

47
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
It smells good.

48
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Did I eat what you made before?

49
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:43,000
I didn't make any good food for you.

50
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:48,000
I guess you are a good lover.

51
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
I am not.

52
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
I am not.

53
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
I am not.

54
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
I am just a lover.

55
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
What's wrong?

56
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Nothing.

57
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
I just want to see you.

58
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
What's wrong with the Xiu Luo Yi

59
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
that Ye Xun said?

60
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
It's the fight before Xiu Luo was born.

61
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,000
The people will dare to call Xiu Luo Yi

62
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:32,000
and become the flower of Bian before Xiu Luo was born.

63
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Then,

64
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,000
why did Ye Tian

65
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,000
not experience Xiu Luo Yi?

66
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
You got the natural flower.

67
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
And you are now a lover.

68
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000
You are now a lover.

69
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
You got the natural flower.

70
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
And you are forced to miss the emperor.

71
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
It's just a few days.

72
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
But the Xiu Luo Yi of Tian Du City

73
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
has been dead for several years.

74
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Ye, it's bad.

75
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Xiu Luo Yi's ship in Tian Du City is getting faster.

76
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Don't worry.

77
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Wait for me first.

78
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Wait for what?

79
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,000
Wait for the general?

80
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
But there is no way for the general.

81
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,000
No.

82
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Wait for the natural flower.

83
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,000
The Ye Tian that wants to get rid of Xiu Luo Yi

84
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,000
with all his strength

85
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
and effort.

86
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
I should never have thought

87
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,000
that this illness

88
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,000
is in my heart.

89
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,000
It's another self.

90
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Hua Zhao Yang,

91
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
you only need to tell me the final conclusion.

92
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
Everything will be solved.

93
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
If I tell you,

94
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000
you will die.

95
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
I have died long ago.

96
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
I don't want to.

97
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
I am a natural.

98
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
I will find a way to solve Xiu Luo Yi.

99
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
I will find a way to keep you here.

100
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,000
I don't want to be a natural

101
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
now.

102
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,000
For me,

103
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
it's meaningless.

104
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,000
Hua Zhao Yang,

105
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,000
you have given me the answer

106
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,000
about love.

107
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,000
What about

108
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
the final conclusion?

109
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Tian Duocheng is in trouble.

110
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,000
I am so painful.

111
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,000
I can't bear it.

112
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
It's okay.

113
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,000
It's okay. I will go to find Ye Xun.

114
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,000
I will go to find Ye Xun.

115
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,000
Don't be afraid.

116
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,000
He can't help me.

117
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
I don't want to live like this.

118
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,000
I don't want to die.

119
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,000
I don't want to die.

120
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000
I don't want to die.

121
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,000
I don't want to die.

122
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,000
I don't want to die.

123
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,000
Don't die.

124
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
Don't die.

125
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,000
Don't die.

126
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,000
Ye Xun.

127
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,000
You are finally back.

128
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,000
The test is completely out.

129
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,000
You have increased

130
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
your strength.

131
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
If you come back later,

132
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,000
I am afraid that

133
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Tian Duocheng will be in trouble.

134
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
Hua Zhao Yang,

135
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,000
think of a way.

136
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
I think that

137
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
Xiu Luo Yi will be in trouble.

138
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,000
Master,

139
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,000
there is no time to hesitate.

140
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,000
If Xiu Luo Yi is in trouble,

141
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,000
I am afraid that

142
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,000
he will be in trouble.

143
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,000
Where is he?

144
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
He can't bear the bad thoughts anymore.

145
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,000
The death of the late emperor

146
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,000
in your mouth

147
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,000
will only

148
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
face the most miserable failure.

149
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,000
He can only watch

150
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,000
the people in his heart

151
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,000
with his own eyes.

152
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,000
Duoluo,

153
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,000
you are so ill.

154
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,000
Who is Xiu Luo?

155
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,000
Can you sense it?

156
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,000
I am helpless.

157
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,000
It's not your fault.

158
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,000
After all, we have never

159
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
experienced the difficulties of Xiu Luo.

160
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,000
Yes, master.

161
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,000
If something happens,

162
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
let's both of us do it.

163
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,000
Yes.

164
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,000
Hua Zhao Yang,

165
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,000
the medicine you have been given

166
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,000
by the jade cannon,

167
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,000
I can't take it anymore.

168
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,000
The medicine you have been given by the jade cannon,

169
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,000
I took it to the patient.

170
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,000
It can cure Xiu Luo Yi.

171
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,000
Of course.

172
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
The medicine that the jade cannon can cure Xiu Luo Yi

173
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,000
is because I have damaged my own power.

174
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,000
Just like a wooden piece,

175
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,000
if it sticks to the water,

176
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
it will form a large amount of ink.

177
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,000
So,

178
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,000
this jade cannon

179
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,000
has taken your power?

180
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,000
This is the best container

181
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,000
I can have in the power of the jade.

182
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,000
So,

183
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,000
does it mean that

184
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
if we have enough medicine,

185
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:39,000
we can completely cure Xiu Luo Yi?

186
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,000
Don't mind it.

187
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,000
Take the medicine first

188
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,000
to the patient.

189
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,000
We still have a long way to go

190
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
to cure Xiu Luo Yi.

191
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,000
Okay.

192
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,000
Okay.

193
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,000
I have prepared

194
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,000
three bottles of medicine for Ye Xun.

195
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,000
This is different from the one you promised me.

196
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,000
I said that

197
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,000
wait until I think it through.

198
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,000
Think it through?

199
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,000
What?

200
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,000
Do you know what it is?

201
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
He gave you the body.

202
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,000
Who?

203
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
The speed of the medicine

204
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,000
can't compare to the speed of Xiu Luo Yi.

205
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,000
The medicine you gave

206
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,000
can only save

207
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
some of the people in the capital.

208
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
I'm thinking of another way.

209
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,000
Didn't you say that

210
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,000
as long as you enter my city,

211
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,000
you can find my flower of love?

212
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,000
Will this end?

213
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,000
Did you find it?

214
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,000
What exactly

215
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
the people in the capital should do?

216
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,000
They are now

217
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,000
one after another.

218
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,000
One after another.
