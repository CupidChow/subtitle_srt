The Legend of Chusen

00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,000
The Legend of Chusen

3
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Episode 16

4
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:43,000
The Legend of Chusen

5
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Lady Hua.

6
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Lady Hua.

7
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Lady Hua, I need to talk to you.

8
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:25,000
The Legend of Chusen

9
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Ye Tian.

10
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Brother.

11
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
What did you do to my brother?

12
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,000
I did nothing.

13
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
I knew you were up to no good.

14
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,000
But you came too late.

15
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Guards.

16
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Yes.

17
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Arrest him.

18
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Yes.

19
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,000
What are you doing?

20
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
I don't know what happened.

21
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,000
I didn't touch him.

22
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Do you think I would believe you?

23
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Arrest him.

24
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Wait.

25
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Mr. Gu.

26
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
The power of the spirit is so strong.

27
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Who hurt Prince Liu like this?

28
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
I saw the registration form.

29
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
You are a key master of the martial arts world.

30
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Your name is Hua Zhaoyang.

31
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,000
I know.

32
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
My name is Hua Zhaoyang.

33
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Am I right?

34
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Yes.

35
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
But I didn't hurt Ye Tian.

36
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
You are still lying.

37
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Since you are both

38
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
guests invited by Prince Liu,

39
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
I won't offend you.

40
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
I have a Aura of the King.

41
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
If the one who is the master is lying,

42
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
the spell will not work.

43
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,000
If you are lying,

44
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,000
the spell will be activated.

45
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:17,000
The more you are sincere, the more you are fierce.

46
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Would you like to prove your innocence?

47
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Yes.

48
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,000
How could it be?

49
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
What are you doing?

50
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Wait.

51
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:43,000
This key master is not lying.

52
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,000
But...

53
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
The King's Mansion will not be wrong.

54
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,000
The truth is more serious.

55
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Master, my brother...

56
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
I will take Prince Liu to heal first.

57
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Thank you, Master.

58
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Demon.

59
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
I said I didn't lie to you.

60
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Do you believe it?

61
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
I thought Prince Liu

62
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
had a full meridians.

63
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Thank you for saving me.

64
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
As far as I know,

65
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:43,000
you have some old wounds.

66
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:47,000
But they have been healed.

67
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Did you get any medicine?

68
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
No.

69
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
I have sent some to my father.

70
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
I thought I was healed

71
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
by the master.

72
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:08,000
It seems that I didn't serve you.

73
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:13,000
How did you get the wound today?

74
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
You don't want to tell me?

75
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:37,000
The key master who was in the Sixth Prince's room

76
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
is strange.

77
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
It was just a coincidence.

78
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Do you know who he is?

79
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:54,000
The key master doesn't believe in the key master.

80
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
I can assure you that

81
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
the key master is not a bad person.

82
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,000
I don't know

83
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
what you have been through.

84
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
But I have something to say.

85
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,000
I have said a lot.

86
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Although the meridians are healed,

87
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
you are seriously ill.

88
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
You are in the lung.

89
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
It's hard to find a cure.

90
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,000
There is no cure.

91
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
This is strange.

92
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
I am just worried that

93
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
the key master is not good for you.

94
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
But if you can

95
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,000
protect the key master,

96
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
I want to ask you

97
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
if you have

98
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
any time to be poisoned?

99
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
What is this strange idea?

100
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
I don't understand.

101
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Your Highness,

102
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
evil thoughts should not be kept in mind for a long time.

103
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
If there is something unpleasant in daily life,

104
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
I am willing to listen

105
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
and share your worries.

106
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,000
You are worrying too much.

107
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Never mind.

108
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
Prince Liu, rest in peace.

109
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,000
Take care, State Preceptor.

110
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:21,000
Three taels of wine, five points of tar,

111
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:25,000
half a inch of hook, two thousand of love flowers.

112
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:29,000
This poison is my best antidote.

113
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
It can solve the past hatred.

114
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,000
Maybe

115
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
I will help you hide the secret

116
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,000
until the last moment.

117
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
Anyone who has the poison on us

118
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,000
should take the medicine

119
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,000
and rest in peace.

120
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,000
State Preceptor,

121
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:59,000
I am so worried about my dead body.

122
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,000
State Preceptor,

123
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:03,000
I am really sorry for you.

124
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,000
Your Majesty,

125
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
it's not what you should say.

126
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
To be honest,

127
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
I feel guilty.

128
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,000
State Preceptor,

129
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
why are you feeling guilty?

130
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,000
I feel guilty.

131
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,000
For many years,

132
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
I have been only concerned about spiritual power and magic.

133
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
I have the title of the best magician in the world,

134
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
but I can't help you.

135
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
State Preceptor, you worry too much.

136
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:33,000
I have never expected to be cured.

137
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,000
I just want to

138
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,000
be able to hold on

139
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:40,000
until the moment when I am forgiven.

140
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,000
His mother

141
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
died in a war with State Preceptor.

142
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
His younger brother is in love with Rong'er.

143
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,000
It's hard to tell.

144
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
I am also heartless.

145
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,000
I can only hope that

146
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
he can be forgiven in time.

147
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
When he can be at ease,

148
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
I can rest assured and rest assured.

149
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,000
I will try my best

150
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,000
to help you with the Sixth Prince.

151
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
State Preceptor, you are considerate.

152
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
When Tian'er grows up,

153
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
I can let you out of the palace

154
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,000
without worrying about you

155
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
and finding the Sura.

156
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,000
I will try my best

157
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,000
to help you.

158
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,000
I will try my best

159
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,000
to help you.

160
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,000
I will try my best

161
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,000
to help you.

162
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,000
I will try my best

163
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,000
to help you.

164
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,000
I will try my best

165
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,000
to help you.

166
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,000
I will try my best

167
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,000
to help you.

168
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,000
I will try my best

169
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,000
to help you.

170
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,000
I will try my best

171
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,000
to help you.

172
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,000
I will try my best

173
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,000
to help you.

174
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,000
I will try my best

175
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,000
to help you.

176
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,000
I will try my best

177
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,000
to help you.

178
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,000
I will try my best

179
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,000
to help you.

180
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,000
I will try my best

181
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,000
to help you.

182
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,000
I will try my best

183
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,000
to help you.

184
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,000
I will try my best

185
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,000
to help you.

186
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,000
I will try my best

187
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,000
to help you.

188
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,000
I will try my best

189
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,000
to help you.

190
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,000
I will try my best

191
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,000
to help you.

192
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,000
I will try my best

193
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,000
to help you.

194
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,000
I will try my best

195
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,000
to help you.

196
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,000
I will try my best

197
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,000
to help you.

198
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,000
I will try my best

199
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,000
to help you.

200
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,000
I will try my best

201
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,000
to help you.

202
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,000
Why are you...

203
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,000
Didn't he

204
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,000
lose face in the palace?

205
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,000
So I changed my clothes.

206
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,000
Did Ye Xun

207
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,000
laugh at you?

208
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,000
How dare he laugh at me?

209
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,000
I...

210
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,000
I think

211
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,000
I'm used to it

212
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
and want to change clothes.

213
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,000
Does it look good?

214
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,000
It fits you.

215
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,000
It fits you.

216
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,000
By the way,

217
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,000
I came here

218
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,000
to explain to you.

219
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,000
Bye.

220
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,000
No need.

221
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,000
I believe

222
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,000
you didn't mean it.

223
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,000
You believe me?

224
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,000
You saved my life.

225
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,000
I believe you.

226
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,000
But

227
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,000
how did you

228
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,000
get in here in the middle of the night?

229
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,000
The guards at your door

230
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,000
didn't let me in.

231
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,000
So I jumped out of the window.

232
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
Are you hungry?

233
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,000
I'm hungry.

234
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,000
The spirit energy

235
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
is the best in the world.

236
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,000
The body that has been

237
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,000
healed overnight

238
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,000
is still in the body.

239
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,000
And the strange

240
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
qi poison that is deep in the bone.

241
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,000
I'm not happy

242
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,000
and angry.

243
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,000
But I'm still

244
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,000
in the doubt.

245
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,000
Ye Tian.

246
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,000
What are you planning?

247
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,000
The soul that I'm looking for

248
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,000
is you, right?

249
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,000
I'm here.

250
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,000
