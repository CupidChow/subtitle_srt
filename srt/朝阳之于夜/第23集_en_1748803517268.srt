1
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
I'm going to activate the formation.

2
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Xiu Luo Yi is not a hostage.

3
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,000
We only need to take the steps in this formation

4
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
to prevent Xiu Luo Yi from being destroyed.

5
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
I don't want to let the master get hurt.

6
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:49,000
I don't want my brother to know that he will be responsible.

7
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Xiu Luo Yi, he has already been killed by the master.

8
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Why can't he get out of the formation?

9
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Xiu Luo Yi, I really don't want to see your brother die.

10
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
I'm not a hostage.

11
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
I'm going to activate the formation.

12
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
I don't want to let the master get hurt.

13
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
I don't want to let the master get hurt.

14
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
I don't want to let Xiu Luo Yi get hurt.

15
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
I don't want to let him get hurt.

16
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
I don't want to let him get hurt.

17
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Master, it's bad.

18
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,000
I told you, no one can disturb you

19
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
when you are treating Hua Zhao Yang.

20
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Hua Rong Yue and Ye Xuan seem to have both got infected.

21
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Master.

22
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Master.

23
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:34,000
If Zhao Yang wakes up,

24
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:39,000
tell him that I will help him.

25
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Kneel down.

26
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Kneel down.

27
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Rong Yue.

28
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Rong Yue.

29
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Rong Yue.

30
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Sorry, Ye Tian.

31
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:22,000
I can't stand it anymore when I see it.

32
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Master.

33
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,000
I want to be alone.

34
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Master.

35
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:22,000
I have to choose to seal all the memories of me

36
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:25,000
in your mind.

37
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:50,000
The sound of the flute.

38
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
The sound of the flute.

39
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
The sound of the flute.

40
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
The sound of the flute.

41
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
The sound of the flute.

42
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
The sound of the flute.

43
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
The sound of the flute.

44
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
The sound of the flute.

45
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
The sound of the flute.

46
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
The sound of the flute.

47
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
The sound of the flute.

48
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
The sound of the flute.

49
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
The sound of the flute.

50
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
The sound of the flute.

51
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
The sound of Pac第一之泽

52
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Processed by Make One

53
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:27,000
I will erase your memories,

54
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:33,000
let everything be normal.

55
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
I tell you now that

56
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
I don't want to hide everything.

57
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Anyway,

58
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
you will never remember me.

59
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
I will never remember you.

60
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
I didn't do anything.

61
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:01,000
But now I understand your feelings.

62
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,000
I'm sorry.

63
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
What's the matter with you?

64
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:23,000
There's always a sweet taste.

65
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
I don't want to regret it.

66
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:28,000
I just don't want to be with you.

67
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:31,000
I just want to be with you.

68
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:34,000
I hope you can break the nature.

69
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
Don't use too long.

70
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
I may not be able to hold on too long.

71
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
But when I come back,

72
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
it's the day of my death.

73
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,000
Chief!

74
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,000
Chief!

75
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:10,000
Luo Ye Tian is here.

76
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
A new hairpin!

77
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,000
I Tian Denglong

78
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
is not his final killer!

79
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:25,220
Iนourself I can only expect his

80
00:08:25,220 --> 00:08:27,000
self-entar鐘

81
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Time flies fast,

82
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:39,800
It's been 13 years.

83
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:41,960
Xiu Luo, you're back.

84
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:43,320
It's been five years.

85
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:44,440
There's no good move.

86
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:45,920
We can't hide like this.

87
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:48,360
Ye Tian is not a coward.

88
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:51,120
Hua Zhao Yang's power is far from her.

89
00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:52,720
She knows better.

90
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:56,000
Master, what do you mean?

91
00:08:56,760 --> 00:08:57,760
I mean

92
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:00,680
Hua Zhao Yang has been closed for five years.

93
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:03,040
He should wake up.

94
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:07,560
Master,

95
00:09:12,920 --> 00:09:14,040
take me in.

96
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:17,880

97
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:23,840

00:09:50,620 --> 00:09:52,340
You.

101
00:09:53,060 --> 00:09:54,100
Xi Bosv.

102
00:09:54,820 --> 00:09:57,120
Same.

103
00:09:57,380 --> 00:10:00,220
I don't like the name.

104
00:10:02,140 --> 00:10:04,700
You call me fly or sun.

105
00:10:04,700 --> 00:10:06,220
Flower and grass,

106
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:09,140
don't forget my pain.

107
00:10:10,540 --> 00:10:12,180
Give me a break.

108
00:10:14,100 --> 00:10:15,420
Can she win?

109
00:10:15,900 --> 00:10:17,180
If she doesn't want to win,

110
00:10:18,580 --> 00:10:20,180
how can she lose?

111
00:10:23,940 --> 00:10:27,020
You lost some memories.

112
00:10:27,860 --> 00:10:29,060
After tonight,

113
00:10:29,620 --> 00:10:32,580
no one can remember the end of five years.

114
00:10:33,580 --> 00:10:34,500
Yes.

115
00:10:49,780 --> 00:10:51,180
Why don't you come in?

116
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:04,820
I've try it but

117
00:11:05,620 --> 00:11:07,540
