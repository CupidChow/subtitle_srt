(The Midnight Romance in Hagwon)

4
00:00:58,190 --> 00:00:59,630
Are you in university? Working part-time?

5
00:01:00,690 --> 00:01:01,759
Yes.

6
00:01:02,459 --> 00:01:04,870
- Starting today, we'll... - What year?

7
00:01:05,929 --> 00:01:06,929
Year three.

8
00:01:09,300 --> 00:01:10,399
Can I call you by your name?

9
00:01:14,380 --> 00:01:15,709
Can you read?

10
00:01:17,979 --> 00:01:19,009
What?

11
00:01:19,110 --> 00:01:20,448
You can be honest.

12
00:01:20,449 --> 00:01:21,649
No need to feel embarrassed.

13
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:28,059
What the heck?

14
00:01:28,520 --> 00:01:31,130
You won't feel as embarrassed as your parents.

15
00:01:33,530 --> 00:01:35,599
Knowing the alphabet doesn't mean you can read.

16
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:36,659
Open your textbook.

17
00:01:36,660 --> 00:01:38,568
I'll teach you how to read.

18
00:01:38,569 --> 00:01:39,630
And...

19
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:41,699
call me "Ms. Seo."

20
00:01:44,770 --> 00:01:45,809
Ms. Seo.

21
00:01:46,039 --> 00:01:47,069
What?

22
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:49,309
Address me the same way.

23
00:01:51,149 --> 00:01:52,209
What?

24
00:01:52,550 --> 00:01:54,280
Refer to me as an instructor too.

25
00:01:56,350 --> 00:01:57,750
I bet it'll feel amazing.

26
00:02:03,860 --> 00:02:05,160
There's no way.

28
00:02:20,539 --> 00:02:22,578
- Hello. - Hello.

29
00:02:22,579 --> 00:02:24,179
- Hello. - Hello.

(Daechi Chase)

31
00:02:25,650 --> 00:02:27,008
Send the test lecture notice...

32
00:02:27,009 --> 00:02:28,350
to those who passed the written test.

33
00:02:29,380 --> 00:02:30,449
Okay.

34
00:02:31,819 --> 00:02:32,949
Hello.

35
00:02:35,620 --> 00:02:37,489
Ms. Seo, you're here early.

36
00:02:38,489 --> 00:02:39,530
What's this for?

37
00:02:40,190 --> 00:02:41,259
You're working so hard.

38
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:43,160
Thanks a lot.

39
00:02:44,370 --> 00:02:46,429
Can I see the resume of one of the applicants?

40
00:02:46,430 --> 00:02:48,039
Sure. What's the name?

41
00:02:48,340 --> 00:02:50,340
- Lee Jun Ho. - Lee Jun Ho...

42
00:02:51,039 --> 00:02:52,668
(1st Round, Resumes)

43
00:02:52,669 --> 00:02:54,009
(Korean)

44
00:02:54,109 --> 00:02:56,180
(Lee Jun Ho, Korean)

45
00:02:56,840 --> 00:02:57,880
Hey.

46
00:02:59,380 --> 00:03:01,318
Isn't it him? On the Wall of Fame?

47
00:03:01,319 --> 00:03:02,319
Yes.

48
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:05,350
(Resume)

49
00:03:10,759 --> 00:03:12,229
Good for him.

50
00:03:16,630 --> 00:03:17,630
Here you go.

51
00:03:18,329 --> 00:03:19,370
Thanks.

52
00:03:23,340 --> 00:03:24,370
- Hello. - Hey.

53
00:03:32,079 --> 00:03:33,079
What was this for?

54
00:03:33,410 --> 00:03:36,380
She wanted the resume of one of the applicants.

55
00:03:37,319 --> 00:03:40,519
Seo Hye Jin's interested in an applicant?

56
00:03:40,949 --> 00:03:42,259
Is she going to give extra points?

57
00:03:42,319 --> 00:03:45,229
No. He was a student here. Lee Jun Ho.

58
00:03:47,329 --> 00:03:48,359
Who?

59
00:03:48,829 --> 00:03:50,130
Lee Jun Ho.

60
00:03:50,229 --> 00:03:52,630
His name is on a plaque in the lobby.

61
00:03:54,370 --> 00:03:57,369
Let me see the resume too.

62
00:03:57,370 --> 00:03:59,669
Why would you need to see that for?

63
00:04:00,039 --> 00:04:02,578
Come on. I'll just see the photo.

64
00:04:02,579 --> 00:04:04,340
- Just the photo? - Yes. Come on.

65
00:04:06,910 --> 00:04:07,919
My gosh.

66
00:04:19,930 --> 00:04:20,960
I'm not late, am I?

67
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:23,460
You're not. Sorry for making you come in early.

68
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:27,030
Private chats are always welcome.

69
00:04:27,570 --> 00:04:29,470
Is this for me? Thanks.

70
00:04:34,039 --> 00:04:36,239
What's up? Why did you want to meet here?

71
00:04:36,780 --> 00:04:38,308
I had all sorts of ideas on the way.

72
00:04:38,309 --> 00:04:39,650
Including if you're moving elsewhere.

73
00:04:41,049 --> 00:04:43,450
Do you remember Jun Ho?

74
00:04:43,850 --> 00:04:45,350
Jun Ho? What Jun Ho?

75
00:04:46,090 --> 00:04:47,890
Lee Jun Ho. From my early days.

76
00:04:48,220 --> 00:04:50,960
Back when our office was above a hair salon?

77
00:04:51,090 --> 00:04:53,128
I remember him. I taught him English.

78
00:04:53,129 --> 00:04:54,160
What about him?

79
00:04:54,330 --> 00:04:55,660
He came by yesterday.

80
00:04:56,929 --> 00:05:00,100
Did he? Doesn't he usually visit on Teachers' Day?

81
00:05:00,970 --> 00:05:02,070
He took the test.

82
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:05,210
Sorry.

83
00:05:08,309 --> 00:05:10,179
- He took what? - The test.

84
00:05:10,379 --> 00:05:11,580
Part of our hiring process.

85
00:05:29,530 --> 00:05:32,070
This punk. He's serious.

86
00:05:32,270 --> 00:05:34,070
I think he did pretty well in the written exam.

87
00:05:34,900 --> 00:05:36,770
He might get called in for a test lecture.

88
00:05:37,070 --> 00:05:38,070
And?

89
00:05:39,410 --> 00:05:42,039
I was hoping you'd reject him.

90
00:05:51,689 --> 00:05:52,789
Why should I do that?

91
00:05:52,919 --> 00:05:54,589
He says he can get the job.

92
00:05:54,590 --> 00:05:56,260
He takes it lightly and he's so arrogant.

93
00:05:57,890 --> 00:05:59,488
You said it's best to be fair.

94
00:05:59,489 --> 00:06:01,400
This sounds like a very unfair request.

95
00:06:01,629 --> 00:06:03,859
Don't you regret quitting your previous job?

96
00:06:06,229 --> 00:06:09,369
How can I let my student throw a childish tantrum?

97
00:06:12,140 --> 00:06:14,239
Does it mean anything if we don't hire him?

98
00:06:14,439 --> 00:06:17,010
With his qualifications, he can teach anywhere else.

99
00:06:17,510 --> 00:06:19,580
I want to earn the time to dissuade him.

100
00:06:20,809 --> 00:06:21,820
Help me out.

101
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:25,090
Okay.

102
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:27,320
I get what you want.

103
00:06:27,789 --> 00:06:30,358
Even if he happens to show promise.

104
00:06:30,359 --> 00:06:31,988
You said yourself that test lectures...

105
00:06:31,989 --> 00:06:33,890
make even a veteran tremble.

106
00:06:34,229 --> 00:06:36,260
How well could an inexperienced guy do?

107
00:06:44,770 --> 00:06:45,809
I passed the written exam.

108
00:06:45,910 --> 00:06:47,238
You won't want to know,

109
00:06:47,239 --> 00:06:49,539
but I have a habit of telling my tutor my exam results.

110
00:06:51,010 --> 00:06:52,609
He seems to think differently.

111
00:06:59,689 --> 00:07:00,720
Hey.

112
00:07:00,820 --> 00:07:02,619
- Hi. - You weirdo.

113
00:07:03,189 --> 00:07:04,220
Come along.

114
00:07:05,189 --> 00:07:06,689
You need a large lecture room?

115
00:07:07,460 --> 00:07:08,900
Why didn't you call the admin and ask?

116
00:07:09,429 --> 00:07:11,059
The smallest room will do.

117
00:07:11,470 --> 00:07:13,100
It's a personal thing. Not official business.

118
00:07:13,999 --> 00:07:15,039
What?

119
00:07:15,739 --> 00:07:17,840
Why would you personally need a classroom?

120
00:07:18,910 --> 00:07:19,969
You don't need to know.

121
00:07:19,970 --> 00:07:23,410
So what? You're going to practice teaching?

122
00:07:23,580 --> 00:07:25,950
Yes. How long can I have this room for?

123
00:07:26,379 --> 00:07:27,749
My gosh...

124
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:32,090
Keep your mouth shut. I'll tell my parents.

125
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:34,249
- My gosh. - Why won't this work?

126
00:07:35,619 --> 00:07:38,058
Don't tell me that's what you meant by the vein of gold...

127
00:07:38,059 --> 00:07:39,160
that never runs dry.

128
00:07:41,799 --> 00:07:44,030
- Lee Jun Ho. - I'm short on time. Get out.

129
00:07:44,559 --> 00:07:46,969
Hey. It's not even a large academy.

130
00:07:46,970 --> 00:07:48,699
You need experience in this field...

131
00:07:48,700 --> 00:07:50,439
to be offered a hefty salary.

132
00:07:55,879 --> 00:07:57,640
Hey. Will you film for me?

133
00:07:58,280 --> 00:08:00,548
Then I'll let you stay for my lecture.

134
00:08:00,549 --> 00:08:02,449
- Are you insane? - Take the camera.

135
00:08:02,450 --> 00:08:03,579
- Forget it. - Come on.

136
00:08:03,580 --> 00:08:04,650
Leave me out of this.

137
00:08:05,749 --> 00:08:07,350
That darn punk.

138
00:08:14,330 --> 00:08:15,330
Let's see.

139
00:08:25,910 --> 00:08:28,509
Fifteen Korean teacher applicants made it to the test lecture round.

140
00:08:28,510 --> 00:08:30,308
Ten from English and three from Social Studies.

141
00:08:30,309 --> 00:08:32,650
They all got full marks in the written exam.

142
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:35,520
The written exam was a formality.

143
00:08:36,450 --> 00:08:38,190
This is the real test.

144
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:40,320
Hey.

145
00:08:43,619 --> 00:08:44,659
What's the matter?

146
00:08:45,989 --> 00:08:47,930
What? Jun Ho's here?

147
00:08:49,300 --> 00:08:50,330
Pardon?

148
00:08:50,859 --> 00:08:52,899
Oh, you don't know him.

149
00:08:53,129 --> 00:08:55,368
Before our two academies merged,

150
00:08:55,369 --> 00:08:57,299
at the beginning of Daechi Chase...

151
00:08:57,300 --> 00:08:59,009
was Lee Jun Ho.

152
00:09:00,970 --> 00:09:02,209
("Spring, Spring" by Kim Yu Jeong)

153
00:09:02,210 --> 00:09:03,478
(Characters: Father-in-law, Me)

154
00:09:03,479 --> 00:09:05,108
(Gu Jang, Jeom Soon)

155
00:09:05,109 --> 00:09:07,349

(Actual conclusion)

159
00:09:12,820 --> 00:09:14,720
(Conflict, Humour)

160
00:09:17,619 --> 00:09:19,429
Today, we'll learn about...

161
00:09:19,430 --> 00:09:21,959
"Spring, Spring" by Kim Yu Jeong.

162
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:24,560
First, we need to know the characters.

163
00:09:24,729 --> 00:09:27,929
There's the main character and narrator, that's "me."

164
00:09:27,930 --> 00:09:30,970
Then there's the father-in-law who I'm in conflict with.

165
00:09:31,070 --> 00:09:32,969
The father-in-law is Jeom Soon's dad,

166
00:09:32,970 --> 00:09:35,479
a cunning tenant farm supervisor.

167
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:39,049
Me, the narrator, is a very dull-witted man...

168
00:09:39,050 --> 00:09:40,679
who's being exploited...

169
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:43,148
by the father-in-law under the impression...

170
00:09:43,149 --> 00:09:44,790
he'll let me marry Jeom Soon.

171
00:09:45,290 --> 00:09:46,590
Between these two...

172
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:11,080
Thanks a lot.

173
00:10:17,450 --> 00:10:19,320
(Lee Jun Ho)

174
00:10:23,060 --> 00:10:24,060
Thanks.

175
00:10:25,430 --> 00:10:26,489
Bye.

176
00:10:27,060 --> 00:10:28,859
Take care. Bye.

177
00:10:30,430 --> 00:10:31,499
See you.

178
00:10:40,009 --> 00:10:41,040
Thank you.

179
00:10:45,550 --> 00:10:46,749
How short do you want it?

180
00:10:46,879 --> 00:10:48,319
- About... - Do you want this?

181
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:50,179
- A natural look? - Do I need a perm?

182
00:10:50,180 --> 00:10:51,320
Not really.

183
00:10:55,690 --> 00:10:57,920
The main character is too slow to notice...

184
00:10:58,389 --> 00:10:59,859
his contradictory reality.

185
00:11:00,690 --> 00:11:04,159
That's the core part of the humour.

186
00:11:05,999 --> 00:11:08,970
The story switches between past and present,

187
00:11:09,470 --> 00:11:10,999

Cussing. Curse words.

371
00:22:46,530 --> 00:22:48,729
It's a surprisingly long marathon.

372
00:22:48,730 --> 00:22:50,168
It's not too late to start now.

373
00:22:50,169 --> 00:22:51,699
You can catch up.

374
00:22:52,540 --> 00:22:55,010
You just don't know how to study.

375
00:22:55,980 --> 00:22:57,040
Don't feel intimidated.

376
00:22:57,679 --> 00:22:58,780
I'll run alongside you.

377
00:23:00,449 --> 00:23:03,980
Today, together, we'll learn about...

378
00:23:05,619 --> 00:23:07,050
"Spring, Spring"...

379
00:23:08,889 --> 00:23:10,819
by Kim Yu Jeong.

380
00:23:10,820 --> 00:23:13,290
("Spring, Spring" by Kim Yu Jeong)

381
00:23:13,929 --> 00:23:15,129
However,

382
00:23:17,459 --> 00:23:19,730
the first line in your textbook will hit you like a brick wall.

383
00:23:20,429 --> 00:23:21,799
"This is a contemporary novel..."

384
00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:23,168
"full of humour, describing incidents..."

385
00:23:23,169 --> 00:23:24,968
"from the countryside in the 1930s."

386
00:23:24,969 --> 00:23:27,069
"Focus on the way it depicts a chain of events..."

387
00:23:27,070 --> 00:23:28,540
"as you read and appreciate it."

388
00:23:31,540 --> 00:23:33,780
What a scary couple of sentences.

389
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:35,080
Listen up.

390
00:23:36,449 --> 00:23:37,618
What does "appreciate" mean?

391
00:23:37,619 --> 00:23:40,448
The dictionary says it's when you enjoy,

392
00:23:40,449 --> 00:23:43,020
understand, and criticize a work of art.

393
00:23:43,619 --> 00:23:45,159
Can you enjoy this?

394
00:23:45,990 --> 00:23:47,030
Can you?

395
00:23:48,830 --> 00:23:50,899
You can. How?

396
00:23:51,300 --> 00:23:52,629
By learning how to read it.

397
00:23:54,570 --> 00:23:55,770
I have...

398
00:23:57,469 --> 00:23:58,869
a great teacher that I respect.

399
00:24:00,010 --> 00:24:01,709
The day we met...

400
00:24:03,209 --> 00:24:05,080
was the best moment of my life.

401
00:24:08,580 --> 00:24:10,520
That teacher had just one requirement.

402
00:24:11,050 --> 00:24:12,719
You just don't know how to read it.

403
00:24:14,490 --> 00:24:17,090
Let's read just one paragraph, then go home.

404
00:24:18,359 --> 00:24:20,188
Read it over and over again,

405
00:24:20,189 --> 00:24:21,990
and eventually, you're able to read it.

406
00:24:22,230 --> 00:24:24,698
And then, between each word, between each line,

407
00:24:24,699 --> 00:24:26,429
a new world opens up.

408
00:24:26,929 --> 00:24:28,300
That's the charm of Korean literature.

409
00:24:29,070 --> 00:24:30,999
If you're able to read, you think.

410
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:33,010
If you're able to think, you get curious.

411
00:24:33,209 --> 00:24:34,340
If you get curious,

412
00:24:35,679 --> 00:24:38,709
you'll end up studying on your own.

413
00:24:40,980 --> 00:24:43,879
Starting today, that's what I'll teach you.

414
00:24:44,580 --> 00:24:47,049
Every sentence and every space in between.

415
00:24:47,050 --> 00:24:48,520
I won't leave it untouched.

416
00:24:49,320 --> 00:24:51,719
Literature, reading, even grammar.

417
00:24:52,530 --> 00:24:53,629
That's the basis of them all.

418
00:25:01,300 --> 00:25:02,439
He's doing fine.

419
00:25:10,679 --> 00:25:12,310
- Hey. - Hey.

420
00:25:13,379 --> 00:25:16,119
What are you doing home this early, Seung Kyu?

421
00:25:16,250 --> 00:25:18,250
Why are you at home?

422
00:25:18,350 --> 00:25:21,448
I cancelled my consultations because there's a special event.

423
00:25:21,449 --> 00:25:23,290
I'll head out later. What about you?

424
00:25:23,560 --> 00:25:24,760
- An event? - Yes.

425
00:25:26,389 --> 00:25:29,428
The professor and undergrads.

426
00:25:29,429 --> 00:25:31,230
They're on a field trip, so I left early.

427
00:25:32,770 --> 00:25:33,869
I need a nap.

428
00:25:41,070 --> 00:25:42,209
I said I'd nap.

429
00:25:42,740 --> 00:25:43,780
Take a seat.

430
00:25:45,780 --> 00:25:47,179
I'm tired.

431
00:25:48,310 --> 00:25:50,820
Did Jun Ho tell you anything?

432
00:25:53,290 --> 00:25:54,320
Yes?

433
00:25:55,689 --> 00:25:57,189
Like what?

434
00:25:58,760 --> 00:25:59,790
He did, then.

435
00:26:01,429 --> 00:26:02,899
He didn't say much.

436
00:26:04,330 --> 00:26:08,030
How shocked will his mom be?

437
00:26:08,899 --> 00:26:10,540
Why would that shock her?

438
00:26:12,510 --> 00:26:15,340
It's a risk, but a worthwhile one.

439
00:26:16,139 --> 00:26:19,708
Unlike his older brother, he upset his parents so much.

440
00:26:19,709 --> 00:26:21,379
They spent a fortune on him.

441
00:26:22,449 --> 00:26:24,049
Oh, well.

442
00:26:24,050 --> 00:26:26,119
What's the point in sending them to a good university?

443
00:26:26,689 --> 00:26:29,290
Everyone at that academy goes to a good university.

444
00:26:30,590 --> 00:26:32,959
With my degree, I can't even do what he does.

445
00:26:33,859 --> 00:26:35,359
Why would you say that?

446
00:26:36,060 --> 00:26:38,398
I know it's your lifelong regret...

447
00:26:38,399 --> 00:26:39,699
that I never beat Jun Ho.

448
00:26:40,699 --> 00:26:42,699
But don't you take this to mean...

449
00:26:43,070 --> 00:26:44,639
you beat his mom, okay?

450
00:26:47,669 --> 00:26:49,340
Why do you...

451
00:26:49,780 --> 00:26:52,580
become a little nasty each day?

452
00:26:53,949 --> 00:26:56,749
A boy who commits a crime goes to juvenile hall,

453
00:26:56,750 --> 00:26:59,119
and a university student who commits a crime goes to grad school.

454
00:27:02,250 --> 00:27:03,990
Is that where I'm learning all the bad stuff?

455
00:27:11,230 --> 00:27:12,469
It's not like...

456
00:27:14,369 --> 00:27:15,629
he'll get the job.

457
00:27:16,869 --> 00:27:18,198
(Judging in progress, Enter only in case of emergency)

458
00:27:18,199 --> 00:27:19,609
We're left with...

459
00:27:19,840 --> 00:27:22,540
Korean teacher applicant Lee Jun Ho.

460
00:27:24,139 --> 00:27:25,509
He practised a great deal,

461
00:27:25,510 --> 00:27:27,049
- and set a good target. - Yes.

462
00:27:27,050 --> 00:27:30,550
Applicants rarely talk directly to a judge.

463
00:27:32,020 --> 00:27:34,090
That opening of his...

464
00:27:34,389 --> 00:27:36,090
Even if it was a performance,

465
00:27:36,189 --> 00:27:37,859
I quite liked his guts.

466
00:27:39,060 --> 00:27:42,060
Affinity, board-writing, delivery.

467
00:27:42,260 --> 00:27:44,030
I liked him overall.

468
00:27:44,399 --> 00:27:47,529
He didn't have long to prepare, but he's a fast learner.

469
00:27:47,530 --> 00:27:49,069
If we're ignoring experience...

470
00:27:49,070 --> 00:27:51,100
and focusing only on promise and potential,

471
00:27:51,199 --> 00:27:53,369
- doesn't that suit this audition? - Yes.

472
00:27:54,369 --> 00:27:57,840
Some people just have the right talent for the job.

473
00:27:58,480 --> 00:28:01,010
I have doubts as to whether he'll do us any good.

474
00:28:02,980 --> 00:28:06,089
We don't have that many "no base" students with low grades.

475
00:28:06,090 --> 00:28:09,820
You don't have to worry about that.

476
00:28:10,020 --> 00:28:13,359
Mr. Yoon, didn't you teach him English?

477
00:28:14,129 --> 00:28:16,129
Yes. I did.

478
00:28:17,629 --> 00:28:21,198
He went from eighth class to first class.

479
00:28:21,199 --> 00:28:23,769
He experienced the whole grade spectrum.

480
00:28:23,770 --> 00:28:26,169
That makes him an all-round player.

481
00:28:29,709 --> 00:28:31,280
What do you think, Ms. Seo?

482
00:28:33,050 --> 00:28:36,178
Since he graduated from high school,

483
00:28:36,179 --> 00:28:38,419
the education system has shuffled twice.

484
00:28:38,850 --> 00:28:41,148
I think we should ignore his prior experience...

485
00:28:41,149 --> 00:28:42,889
of going from eighth to first.

486
00:28:45,990 --> 00:28:48,590
He used his affinity to cover up his poorly prepared lecture.

487
00:28:49,060 --> 00:28:51,829
More than anything, I think the chance...

488
00:28:51,830 --> 00:28:53,429
that he'll last is very low.

489
00:28:53,969 --> 00:28:55,030
Okay.

490
00:28:55,899 --> 00:28:58,069
What do you mean he won't last?

491
00:28:58,070 --> 00:29:00,570
To train up a fledgling instructor,

492
00:29:00,669 --> 00:29:04,209
the academy must put in a lot of time and effort.

493
00:29:04,340 --> 00:29:07,009
Until the teacher can manage on their own,

494
00:29:07,010 --> 00:29:08,479
the academy invests in them.

495
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:11,549
Of course, at the end of all that, if they were to stay...

496
00:29:11,550 --> 00:29:13,090
and be an asset, that would be great.

497
00:29:13,919 --> 00:29:16,089
But to be honest,

498
00:29:16,090 --> 00:29:18,490
that he'll learn and grow enough to be of any good to us,

499
00:29:18,919 --> 00:29:19,959
I'm not convinced.

500
00:29:20,929 --> 00:29:22,959
I see. So you think he'll just dine and dash?

501
00:29:23,899 --> 00:29:27,129
He didn't even stay for three years at his last job before he quit.

502
00:29:28,129 --> 00:29:30,368
But the academy will be covering the losses,

503
00:29:30,369 --> 00:29:32,070
not you.

504
00:29:32,639 --> 00:29:34,169
So I don't have to train him?

505
00:29:34,840 --> 00:29:36,678
Will you train him then?

506
00:29:36,679 --> 00:29:38,439
Our team doesn't have resources to train a rookie.

507
00:29:38,879 --> 00:29:41,009
My plate is already full with my classes, consultations,

508
00:29:41,010 --> 00:29:42,780
and student management.

509
00:29:43,250 --> 00:29:45,618
I'm against the idea of hiring an unreliable rookie...

510
00:29:45,619 --> 00:29:47,388
because I don't want to waste my energy unnecessarily...

511
00:29:47,389 --> 00:29:48,719
when we have a list of capable and talented teachers.

512
00:29:56,800 --> 00:29:57,899
I can see that.

513
00:29:58,260 --> 00:30:01,330
As you are the teacher in charge, your opinion must matter the most.

514
00:30:01,629 --> 00:30:02,969
- Thank you. - I see.

515
00:30:04,040 --> 00:30:07,369
Then I will give you more time, Ms. Seo.

516
00:30:07,570 --> 00:30:09,510
No. I already...

517
00:30:09,840 --> 00:30:13,249
The directors usually have the final say...

518
00:30:13,250 --> 00:30:15,749
in the recruitment process at many academies.

519
00:30:15,750 --> 00:30:16,750
Don't they?

520
00:30:17,419 --> 00:30:18,448
Yes.

521
00:30:18,449 --> 00:30:21,089
But I still listen to your advice...

522
00:30:21,090 --> 00:30:22,990
and gather your opinions in a democratic manner.

523
00:30:26,189 --> 00:30:28,260
Let's all think about this.

524
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:30,830
I understand.

525
00:30:32,600 --> 00:30:34,629
With the increased average lifespan, ageing has become a problem.

526
00:30:35,129 --> 00:30:37,040
This problem not only pertains to the elderly,

527
00:30:37,270 --> 00:30:40,708
but also to people in their 30s and 40s which I mentioned earlier.

528
00:30:40,709 --> 00:30:43,480
The rate of ageing for people in their 30s and 40s has gone up.

529
00:30:43,679 --> 00:30:45,878
Lately, there has been...

530
00:30:45,879 --> 00:30:47,350
Honey, could you help me?

531
00:30:49,280 --> 00:30:50,280
Help you how?

532
00:30:51,250 --> 00:30:52,649
Pat me on the back.

533
00:30:52,750 --> 00:30:54,990
Gosh. Do I have indigestion?

534
00:30:55,919 --> 00:30:57,159
Gosh.

535
00:30:57,659 --> 00:30:59,659
You have indigestion because you don't do anything all day.

536
00:31:00,659 --> 00:31:02,289
What are you talking about?

537
00:31:02,290 --> 00:31:04,629
I made side dishes for Young Ho and left them at his house.

538
00:31:04,830 --> 00:31:07,128
You need to do something more productive.

539
00:31:07,129 --> 00:31:08,669
You should learn something.

540
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:12,040
What could be more productive than helping our son?

541
00:31:13,439 --> 00:31:16,040
What's gotten into you? Why are you yelling at me?

542
00:31:16,209 --> 00:31:18,679
- Gosh. Seriously. - Goodness.

543
00:31:28,189 --> 00:31:30,459
- I'm home. - Hey, welcome back.

544
00:31:30,790 --> 00:31:31,889
Did you have dinner?

545
00:31:32,359 --> 00:31:34,259
- Yes, I did. - Then wash up.

546
00:31:34,260 --> 00:31:35,560
- Okay. - Do you want some fruits?

547
00:31:36,230 --> 00:31:37,429
I'm good with fruits.

548
00:31:38,359 --> 00:31:40,899
Well, I need to talk to you.

549
00:31:41,169 --> 00:31:43,539
All of these will accumulate.

550
00:31:43,540 --> 00:31:46,209
That will contribute to your ageing process.

551
00:31:46,409 --> 00:31:49,679
As our world is changing, there are many environmental changes.

552
00:31:52,510 --> 00:31:54,649
Okay. What's this about?

553
00:31:56,750 --> 00:31:58,219
This news might shock you.

554
00:31:58,750 --> 00:32:00,149
But please let me finish.

555
00:32:02,520 --> 00:32:03,520
Go on.

556
00:32:08,389 --> 00:32:09,399
I handed in my resignation.

557
00:32:10,830 --> 00:32:11,899
And they accepted it.

558
00:32:17,300 --> 00:32:19,369
Please respect my decision.

559
00:32:20,409 --> 00:32:21,439
- What? - What?

560
00:32:23,810 --> 00:32:26,010
Hey. Why?

561
00:32:26,879 --> 00:32:27,879
You did that...

562
00:32:28,649 --> 00:32:31,719
without discussing that with us? Not even running it by us?

563
00:32:31,980 --> 00:32:33,448
You would have been against it if I discussed it with you.

564
00:32:33,449 --> 00:32:35,119
I would have made the same decision even if you opposed it.

565
00:32:36,159 --> 00:32:37,689
I just skipped all the unnecessary hassle.

566
00:32:37,889 --> 00:32:39,159
We're asking you why you quit.

567
00:32:40,990 --> 00:32:42,060
Answer us already.

568
00:32:42,689 --> 00:32:44,859
Do you want me to die out of frustration?

569
00:32:50,770 --> 00:32:52,600
I'm going to teach kids at an academy.

570
00:32:53,340 --> 00:32:54,369
I took the exam today.

571
00:32:57,340 --> 00:32:58,409
I did well.

572
00:32:58,679 --> 00:32:59,708
Even if it doesn't work out,

573
00:32:59,709 --> 00:33:00,850
I'll keep applying to other academies.

574
00:33:03,419 --> 00:33:04,649
You want to do what?

575
00:33:04,820 --> 00:33:08,149
I can be the most famous teacher in Korea within three years.

576
00:33:08,250 --> 00:33:10,219
- Then my salary... - Are you out of your mind?

577
00:33:11,090 --> 00:33:12,090
No.

578
00:33:12,760 --> 00:33:14,889
Hey, those two careers are on different levels.

579
00:33:16,199 --> 00:33:18,698
They aren't. The world started to change a long time ago.

580
00:33:18,699 --> 00:33:20,029
Hey, do you think your job is a joke?

581
00:33:20,030 --> 00:33:22,070
I worked harder and more diligently than any of my colleagues.

582
00:33:22,530 --> 00:33:24,299
The office job wasn't that important to me.

583
00:33:24,300 --> 00:33:25,339
You didn't even work there for a long time!

584
00:33:25,340 --> 00:33:27,009
I chose this path because I didn't think...

585
00:33:27,010 --> 00:33:28,209
I would have a long career there.

586
00:33:32,480 --> 00:33:33,550
The social position?

587
00:33:34,010 --> 00:33:36,449
Yes, I understand that you're concerned about that.

588
00:33:36,619 --> 00:33:38,218
I'll prove it to you by how much I make and where...

589
00:33:38,219 --> 00:33:39,219
Stop it!

590
00:33:41,590 --> 00:33:43,389
How dare you talk to me about such a vulgar thing?

591
00:33:43,520 --> 00:33:44,520
Gosh, come on.

592
00:33:48,889 --> 00:33:50,800
You were born in a lucky era.

593
00:33:52,129 --> 00:33:53,199
Thanks to that,

594
00:33:53,629 --> 00:33:55,428
our family could live as locals, born and raised in Daechi-dong.

595
00:33:55,429 --> 00:33:56,939
But my brothers and I...

596
00:33:57,570 --> 00:33:59,468
will end up in the outskirts of Seoul...

597
00:33:59,469 --> 00:34:01,240
if we stay as mere office workers.

598
00:34:01,340 --> 00:34:02,570
I really don't want that to happen.

599
00:34:04,510 --> 00:34:06,179
I can succeed as an academy teacher faster than anyone.

600
00:34:06,449 --> 00:34:07,480
Think of it...

601
00:34:07,980 --> 00:34:10,619
as becoming a celebrity. Please?

602
00:34:11,850 --> 00:34:13,089
You're way too young.

603
00:34:16,860 --> 00:34:18,360
Stay at the company for a bit longer.

604
00:34:18,989 --> 00:34:20,028
If you really don't see a future there,

605
00:34:20,029 --> 00:34:21,060
you can try it out then.

606
00:34:21,159 --> 00:34:22,929
My value will go down if I try it out later.

607
00:34:23,830 --> 00:34:25,560
A product must be sold at the peak price.

608
00:34:25,900 --> 00:34:28,230
Honey.

609
00:34:30,900 --> 00:34:31,969
Mom, are you okay?

610
00:34:32,369 --> 00:34:33,440
Get out.

611
00:34:35,739 --> 00:34:38,540
Get out of here. Tell your dad to come here.

612
00:34:39,610 --> 00:34:40,678
Get up.

613
00:34:40,679 --> 00:34:43,150
Come on. Just get out of here!

614
00:34:44,920 --> 00:34:45,920
Get up.

615
00:34:48,790 --> 00:34:51,190
Gosh. Oh, dear.

616
00:36:57,920 --> 00:36:58,949
Stay there.

617
00:37:05,889 --> 00:37:07,989
- Did you have to wait long? - No.

618
00:37:08,690 --> 00:37:10,630
I wouldn't have minded waiting for a bit longer.

619
00:37:10,759 --> 00:37:12,159
The view here is amazing.

620
00:37:13,500 --> 00:37:14,569
You're right.

621
00:37:16,670 --> 00:37:19,439
I was surprised to get your text message last night.

622
00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:20,509
What's going on?

623
00:37:21,170 --> 00:37:23,739
Is this about the recruitment result?

624
00:37:25,380 --> 00:37:26,549
Do you remember this place?

625
00:37:27,779 --> 00:37:29,779
You brought me here every weekend.

626
00:37:30,049 --> 00:37:32,779
I still remember the bus number. Bus 402.

627
00:37:34,690 --> 00:37:35,719
How about a walk?

628
00:37:36,489 --> 00:37:37,520
Sounds good.

629
00:37:52,369 --> 00:37:53,869
You won't be able to work at Daechi Chase.

630
00:37:55,210 --> 00:37:56,839
What? Why not?

631
00:37:58,080 --> 00:38:00,380
Wait. Are you joking right now?

632
00:38:01,650 --> 00:38:04,350
Wait. But wasn't I pretty good?

633
00:38:05,150 --> 00:38:06,719
I'm not joking. You can't join Daechi Chase.

634
00:38:09,020 --> 00:38:10,219
Gosh.

635
00:38:11,219 --> 00:38:12,659
I didn't know the entry barrier was that high.

636
00:38:13,989 --> 00:38:15,330
I need to check something with you.

637
00:38:16,360 --> 00:38:17,429
What is it?

638
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:20,000
I'm feeling devastated right now.

639
00:38:20,270 --> 00:38:21,929
Did you look into getting a job at other academies?

640
00:38:23,739 --> 00:38:24,770
No, not yet.

641
00:38:25,739 --> 00:38:28,540
But I'm checking postings on the Teachers' World.

642
00:38:30,779 --> 00:38:32,639
I want you to have...

643
00:38:33,449 --> 00:38:36,849
a wider, deeper, and more insightful perspective of the world,

644
00:38:36,850 --> 00:38:38,850
surrounded by people, wiser than you.

645
00:38:43,989 --> 00:38:46,928
A bit more expensive apartment unit than that. Okay?

646
00:38:46,929 --> 00:38:48,730
A bigger house on a higher floor.

647
00:38:50,060 --> 00:38:51,400
Don't make them your goals.

648
00:38:53,869 --> 00:38:54,869
That's so cliche.

649
00:38:57,069 --> 00:38:58,139
Sorry.

650
00:38:58,299 --> 00:39:00,040
Well, you didn't have to apologize.

651
00:39:05,580 --> 00:39:06,779
I lied.

652
00:39:07,880 --> 00:39:08,949
What?

653
00:39:09,509 --> 00:39:11,319
I said my job was fantastic.

654
00:39:12,420 --> 00:39:13,449
It was a lie.

655
00:39:15,089 --> 00:39:16,219
I boasted because I make decent money,

656
00:39:17,460 --> 00:39:19,560
Teachers like me are a dime a dozen in Daechi-dong.

657
00:39:22,560 --> 00:39:24,259
When I practised for my test lecture,

658
00:39:24,529 --> 00:39:26,600
I became interested in teaching.

659
00:39:27,630 --> 00:39:28,630
I was also lying when I said...

660
00:39:28,631 --> 00:39:31,000
getting you into the university was the best moment of my life.

661
00:39:33,369 --> 00:39:35,039
Forget about earning money for tuition. I started this job...

662
00:39:35,040 --> 00:39:36,440
because I didn't even have money for food.

663
00:39:36,540 --> 00:39:38,310
I was happy that you got into a nice university.

664
00:39:38,710 --> 00:39:39,879
Your success wasn't the only reason.

665
00:39:39,880 --> 00:39:41,709
I got a huge bonus after that.

666
00:39:41,710 --> 00:39:43,279
So I could pay tuition with that.

667
00:39:44,319 --> 00:39:45,778
You said you respected me as a teacher.

668
00:39:45,779 --> 00:39:48,419
Hey, every time I brought you to this library,

669
00:39:48,420 --> 00:39:49,718
I was so annoyed.

670
00:39:49,719 --> 00:39:51,860
- I... - Okay. I got it.

671
00:39:52,920 --> 00:39:54,290
That's enough. Let's stop here.

672
00:39:55,230 --> 00:39:56,290
I got it.

673
00:39:56,730 --> 00:39:58,900
I understand how you feel.

674
00:40:03,500 --> 00:40:04,639
Don't you think you're crossing the line?

675
00:40:06,909 --> 00:40:07,909
What?

676
00:40:08,339 --> 00:40:10,980
So you helped me get into a nice university.

677
00:40:11,179 --> 00:40:12,939
Thanks to that, you got a huge bonus.

678
00:40:12,940 --> 00:40:14,049
Yes. They're all facts.

679
00:40:15,250 --> 00:40:16,310
But...

680
00:40:17,650 --> 00:40:19,650
Should I learn about your personal opinion of this job?

681
00:40:22,319 --> 00:40:24,719
I didn't ask you how meaningful this job was.

682
00:40:25,560 --> 00:40:26,859
I told you I wanted to help the kids...

683
00:40:26,860 --> 00:40:28,130
bring up their grades and get paid accordingly.

684
00:40:28,589 --> 00:40:30,629
Why are you telling me things I didn't ask for?

685
00:40:30,630 --> 00:40:32,429
Everything you told me didn't affect me in any way.

686
00:40:33,869 --> 00:40:34,969
On top of that,

687
00:40:35,670 --> 00:40:36,999
I took the exam as an applicant...

688
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:39,440
because I wanted to be evaluated based on my skill set.

689
00:40:40,170 --> 00:40:41,739
But taking this so personally like this...

690
00:40:42,869 --> 00:40:43,879
is a bit odd.

691
00:40:43,880 --> 00:40:45,738
There's nothing odd about this. I just want you...

692
00:40:45,739 --> 00:40:47,349
Then it won't matter to you...

693
00:40:47,350 --> 00:40:49,549
if the academy finds out what you're doing right now.

694
00:40:50,279 --> 00:40:52,919
Can I tell the academy that you're meeting an applicant in private...

695
00:40:52,920 --> 00:40:53,920
to pressure him to drop out?

696
00:41:02,460 --> 00:41:03,500
I'll get going first.

697
00:41:03,830 --> 00:41:05,059
Come on. We're not done yet. Where are you going?

698
00:41:05,060 --> 00:41:06,258
Your classes start in the evening.

699
00:41:06,259 --> 00:41:07,330
I have a meeting.

700
00:41:08,230 --> 00:41:09,270
Ms. Seo!

701
00:41:19,679 --> 00:41:20,710
Gosh.

702
00:41:30,219 --> 00:41:31,259
What...

703
00:41:39,560 --> 00:41:40,630
I'll drive.

704
00:41:41,770 --> 00:41:42,798
What?

705
00:41:42,799 --> 00:41:44,400
You're shocked. Let me drive you.

706
00:41:46,670 --> 00:41:47,969
Sorry. You're on your own.

707
00:41:48,440 --> 00:41:49,469
Take Bus 402.

708
00:42:15,400 --> 00:42:16,799
Gosh. That was embarrassing.

709
00:42:19,069 --> 00:42:20,310
The payment is processed.

710
00:42:25,480 --> 00:42:26,809
(Phonological Variation)

711
00:42:26,810 --> 00:42:28,080
Let me emphasize this again.

712
00:42:29,380 --> 00:42:31,880
The questions on the exam will only be based on the textbook.

713
00:42:33,489 --> 00:42:35,020
The exam questions won't go beyond our textbook.

714
00:42:36,089 --> 00:42:38,020
Our curriculum and multiple choices will be based on our textbook.

715
00:42:38,790 --> 00:42:40,589
I won't use any linked works on the exam.

716
00:42:40,759 --> 00:42:44,028
However, I will increase the ratio for essay questions.

717
00:42:44,029 --> 00:42:46,129
- What? - What? Seriously?

718
00:42:46,130 --> 00:42:47,269
What essay questions?

719
00:42:47,270 --> 00:42:48,599
I will teach you the materials...

720
00:42:48,600 --> 00:42:49,929
you must learn in your Korean classes...

721
00:42:51,069 --> 00:42:52,339
as tenth graders.

722
00:42:53,170 --> 00:42:54,339
Only focus on the materials...

723
00:42:55,110 --> 00:42:57,080
I teach you and emphasize.

724
00:42:57,980 --> 00:42:59,009
I am...

725
00:42:59,839 --> 00:43:02,279
only doing my job as your school teacher.

726
00:43:05,279 --> 00:43:07,088
Then will the Korean teacher for the other classes...

727
00:43:07,089 --> 00:43:08,889
go over the same materials?

728
00:43:09,650 --> 00:43:12,159
I can't intervene with the other Korean teacher's classes.

729
00:43:13,060 --> 00:43:15,959
However, the other Korean teacher can't come up with exam questions...

730
00:43:15,960 --> 00:43:17,699
about materials you didn't learn.

731
00:43:21,400 --> 00:43:23,440
I won't stop you from finding your own way of studying for this.

732
00:43:25,299 --> 00:43:27,339
You can keep studying at the academy you've been going.

733
00:43:27,869 --> 00:43:29,310
Or you can study with the EBS lectures.

734
00:43:32,210 --> 00:43:35,610
However, I will create a supplementary class after school.

735
00:43:35,810 --> 00:43:37,850
I plan to give an intensive course based on our regular class.

736
00:43:38,420 --> 00:43:39,679
You can apply for it just as usual.

737
00:43:40,449 --> 00:43:41,520
Any questions?

738
00:43:43,350 --> 00:43:44,420
All right then.

739
00:43:51,500 --> 00:43:53,130
What's wrong with that geezer?

740
00:43:53,230 --> 00:43:55,630
What was that all about? Our final exam is coming up soon.

741
00:43:57,469 --> 00:43:59,670
I have no idea. I should ask my mom.

742
00:44:34,040 --> 00:44:35,969
Yes, Mr. Kim. I'm in the parking lot.

743
00:44:37,639 --> 00:44:38,679
Pardon?

744
00:44:42,949 --> 00:44:44,880
(Daechi Chase)

745
00:44:47,350 --> 00:44:48,489
- Hello. - Hi.

746
00:44:48,949 --> 00:44:50,118
- Hello. - Hello.

747
00:44:50,119 --> 00:44:52,089
(Daechi Chase)

748
00:44:52,319 --> 00:44:54,159
Gosh. Director Shim.

749
00:44:54,389 --> 00:44:57,699
How could you say this is Ms. Seo's fault?

750
00:44:57,759 --> 00:45:00,060
The school teacher just made a courageous decision.

751
00:45:01,630 --> 00:45:03,299
Come on in.

752
00:45:04,699 --> 00:45:05,699
Pardon?

753
00:45:05,900 --> 00:45:07,940
What do you mean by "crisis?"

754
00:45:08,469 --> 00:45:10,509
Don't you think you're being too harsh?

755
00:45:11,440 --> 00:45:14,309
Gosh. Why should she ask for his forgiveness?

756
00:45:14,310 --> 00:45:17,318
Sir, you know what? Let's meet tonight.

757
00:45:17,319 --> 00:45:18,750
I'll buy you a drink.

758
00:45:19,350 --> 00:45:20,420
Yes.

759
00:45:20,690 --> 00:45:24,619
Gosh. You can tell me the rest of your complaint in person.

760
00:45:27,690 --> 00:45:30,158
Gosh. Just listen to him talk.

761
00:45:30,159 --> 00:45:31,798
No wonder why his academy can't grow.

762
00:45:31,799 --> 00:45:33,630
He's got no charisma.

763
00:45:34,199 --> 00:45:35,230
What's this about?

764
00:45:35,969 --> 00:45:37,068
The problematic school teacher...

765
00:45:37,069 --> 00:45:39,500
at Chanyoung High School made a declaration.

766
00:45:39,770 --> 00:45:41,309
He said all of his exam questions for the final...

767
00:45:41,310 --> 00:45:42,569
would come from the textbook.

768
00:45:42,839 --> 00:45:43,980
He increased the ratio for essay questions.

769
00:45:44,409 --> 00:45:46,040
He will hold an after-school intensive course.

770
00:45:46,239 --> 00:45:47,279
So...

771
00:45:48,049 --> 00:45:50,048
The students are completely confused.

772
00:45:50,049 --> 00:45:51,819
The academies are in shock.

773
00:45:53,989 --> 00:45:56,588
So I should go to him and ask for his forgiveness?

774
00:45:56,589 --> 00:45:57,989
Gosh. Oh, my.

775
00:45:58,219 --> 00:46:00,190
I'll stop you even if you want to do it.

776
00:46:00,290 --> 00:46:01,730
If need be, I'll do it.

777
00:46:02,060 --> 00:46:03,659
I'm good at kneeling down.

778
00:46:05,860 --> 00:46:06,899
Even so,

779
00:46:06,900 --> 00:46:09,230
we should still prepare ourselves for this.

780
00:46:16,310 --> 00:46:18,138
I don't think the kids will drop out of our academy...

781
00:46:18,139 --> 00:46:20,040
because of the direction the schoolteacher is taking.

782
00:46:21,250 --> 00:46:22,448
As this is new to them,

783
00:46:22,449 --> 00:46:23,880
they will have no choice but to rely on us.

784
00:46:24,150 --> 00:46:25,250
Right. Yes.

785
00:46:25,949 --> 00:46:27,689
The levels of students can't be assessed with this exam.

786
00:46:27,690 --> 00:46:28,988
Then students in the low to mid-tiers...

787
00:46:28,989 --> 00:46:30,258
will see this as a chance.

788
00:46:30,259 --> 00:46:31,259
The students in the high tier...

789
00:46:31,260 --> 00:46:32,920
will do their best to maintain their grades.

790
00:46:33,219 --> 00:46:34,989
Right. That's true.

791
00:46:35,429 --> 00:46:38,460
To have an optimistic view on this, some people are feeling scared.

792
00:46:38,730 --> 00:46:40,729
We're already getting many calls about the consultations.

793
00:46:40,730 --> 00:46:41,968
Of course, there will be confusion.

794
00:46:41,969 --> 00:46:43,738
But it will be the same case for other academies.

795
00:46:43,739 --> 00:46:44,739
Right.

796
00:46:47,310 --> 00:46:48,468
I'll see if I can hold more classes,

797
00:46:48,469 --> 00:46:50,009
targeting students in the low to mid-tier.

798
00:46:50,440 --> 00:46:53,009
If we can get a few students whose grades go up drastically...

799
00:46:53,750 --> 00:46:55,409
So that should be enough to continue our momentum until next year?

800
00:46:55,779 --> 00:46:58,048
Middle school students planning to enter Chanyoung High...

801
00:46:58,049 --> 00:47:00,520
won't be able to choose another teacher other than me.

802
00:47:03,089 --> 00:47:05,690
I'm just worried that it might take a toll on you.

803
00:47:06,659 --> 00:47:08,959
Protecting you is more important...

804
00:47:08,960 --> 00:47:11,159
than getting a few more students.

805
00:47:12,130 --> 00:47:14,569
Gosh. Thank you for saying so.

806
00:47:19,900 --> 00:47:21,539
- Take... - Precautions!

807
00:47:21,540 --> 00:47:23,138
- Let's stay... - Safe!

808
00:47:23,139 --> 00:47:25,080
(Pork Sirloin, Sea Eels)

809
00:47:33,279 --> 00:47:34,449
Let me do it.

810
00:47:35,850 --> 00:47:36,920
Use the tongs.

811
00:47:38,389 --> 00:47:39,819
You should eat. I'll do it.

812
00:47:41,489 --> 00:47:42,959
The prices for international raw materials...

813
00:47:42,960 --> 00:47:44,630
are skyrocketing.

814
00:47:45,400 --> 00:47:47,269
If the interest rates keep going up in the US like this,

815
00:47:47,270 --> 00:47:49,170
the export industry will take a hit.

816
00:47:57,909 --> 00:47:59,339
Gosh, you should slow down.

817
00:48:08,719 --> 00:48:11,560
It may seem boring and suffocating at first.

818
00:48:13,389 --> 00:48:15,529
But you ought to live like them just like the others.

819
00:48:19,659 --> 00:48:21,769
If you don't want that, you should study more.

820
00:48:21,770 --> 00:48:22,869
I'll support you.

821
00:48:26,699 --> 00:48:28,540
I understand why you did it.

822
00:48:30,339 --> 00:48:31,380
Dad.

823
00:48:32,139 --> 00:48:33,210
Yes.

824
00:48:34,250 --> 00:48:35,279
I'll move out.

825
00:48:36,779 --> 00:48:37,850
What?

826
00:48:38,549 --> 00:48:40,019
"Maybe, I can do something for him."

827
00:48:40,020 --> 00:48:41,489
"There must be a solution."

828
00:48:42,049 --> 00:48:43,049
Don't look for that.

829
00:48:44,159 --> 00:48:45,489
- Lee Jun Ho. - You know,

830
00:48:46,259 --> 00:48:47,459
I'll come back with a bank account...

831
00:48:47,460 --> 00:48:48,658
that receives tens of thousands of dollars every month.

832
00:48:48,659 --> 00:48:50,230
And I'll also bring a contract for a new apartment unit in Gangnam.

833
00:48:52,799 --> 00:48:54,330
You never had those, did you?

834
00:49:07,040 --> 00:49:10,350
Social life at a major company can be hard.

835
00:49:12,119 --> 00:49:14,449
You can look into successful mid-sized companies.

836
00:49:16,350 --> 00:49:18,319
Was your social life in the office hard?

837
00:49:19,960 --> 00:49:20,989
It wasn't for me.

838
00:50:01,569 --> 00:50:02,569
Shall I take out the charcoal?

839
00:50:03,500 --> 00:50:05,469
- No. - All right.

840
00:50:09,839 --> 00:50:12,209
(Fixing the House)

841
00:50:12,210 --> 00:50:14,250
(Lee Kyu Bo)

842
00:50:20,949 --> 00:50:22,290
Don't you think you're crossing the line?

843
00:50:39,600 --> 00:50:42,310
How did it go with Director Shim? Did you calm him down?

844
00:50:42,909 --> 00:50:44,440
It was a mess, you know?

845
00:50:47,949 --> 00:50:50,379
Well, I was on my way home...

846
00:50:50,380 --> 00:50:52,048
when the office lights were on.

847
00:50:52,049 --> 00:50:54,250
I knew it would be you, Seo Hye Jin.

848
00:50:56,219 --> 00:50:58,319
Drinking like this brings back memories.

849
00:50:58,690 --> 00:51:00,420
When we were both broke,

850
00:51:01,190 --> 00:51:03,429
we used to drink bottles of soju at that corner.

851
00:51:03,560 --> 00:51:05,460
You taught me how to drink.

852
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:12,169
Gosh. When I joined the academy...

853
00:51:12,170 --> 00:51:14,170
after the movie I made with the money...

854
00:51:14,369 --> 00:51:15,969
from my friend flopped,

855
00:51:17,480 --> 00:51:20,139
little did I know such a day would come.

856
00:51:20,239 --> 00:51:22,449
You were quite cool back then.

857
00:51:23,179 --> 00:51:24,650
A moviemaker seeking to make a comeback.

858
00:51:24,819 --> 00:51:26,350
- Really? - Yes.

859
00:51:26,819 --> 00:51:28,249
I love your movies,

860
00:51:28,250 --> 00:51:29,949
though I can't recommend them to others.

861
00:51:30,690 --> 00:51:31,690
You little...

862
00:51:34,460 --> 00:51:38,329
There used to be a theatre called Piccadilly in Jongno.

863
00:51:38,330 --> 00:51:39,330
I know it.

864
00:51:39,331 --> 00:51:42,528
Remember there were handprints...

865
00:51:42,529 --> 00:51:44,238
on the pavement before the theatre?

866
00:51:44,239 --> 00:51:45,299
Yes.

867
00:51:46,069 --> 00:51:48,339
My dream was to take my actors...

868
00:51:48,909 --> 00:51:50,469
and have them make handprints.

869
00:51:52,739 --> 00:51:54,278
Now, my life is devoted...

870
00:51:54,279 --> 00:51:56,009
to the student's college entrance exam results alone.

871
00:51:58,449 --> 00:51:59,880
"College entrance exam results alone?"

872
00:52:00,480 --> 00:52:02,190
That's a very meaningful life.

873
00:52:03,850 --> 00:52:05,189
Do you really think like that?

874
00:52:05,190 --> 00:52:06,489
Of course.

875
00:52:09,360 --> 00:52:10,429
But...

876
00:52:11,159 --> 00:52:12,960
why do you act like a teacher?

877
00:52:15,029 --> 00:52:16,330
I mean to Jun Ho.

878
00:52:56,739 --> 00:52:59,210
I can't bring myself to refer to you as a teacher.

879
00:53:00,440 --> 00:53:01,710
Don't you think you're crossing the line?

880
00:53:03,549 --> 00:53:06,150
But why do you act like a teacher?

881
00:54:07,710 --> 00:54:10,080
(Daechi Chase)

882
00:54:11,719 --> 00:54:12,719
(Daechi Chase)

883
00:54:12,720 --> 00:54:14,889
You made the right decision.

884
00:54:15,589 --> 00:54:17,489
Thanks for changing your mind.

885
00:54:18,520 --> 00:54:21,758
You're willing to invest in a new talent.

886
00:54:21,759 --> 00:54:23,089
I should be supportive.

887
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:27,698
Here's something I'm curious about.

888
00:54:27,699 --> 00:54:28,769
Yes?

889
00:54:28,770 --> 00:54:30,630
Had I been against it until the end,

890
00:54:31,069 --> 00:54:32,469
what were you going to do?

891
00:54:33,639 --> 00:54:35,639
Who knows? I haven't thought about it.

892
00:54:37,009 --> 00:54:38,009
How come?

893
00:54:38,010 --> 00:54:41,110
I knew Lee Jun Ho was going to become mine.

894
00:54:41,679 --> 00:54:42,679
It was a gut feeling.

895
00:54:47,080 --> 00:54:48,850
I have a favour to ask, Director.

896
00:54:49,449 --> 00:54:50,489
This right here.

897
00:54:51,060 --> 00:54:53,489
Draw a picture in your mind.

898
00:54:53,719 --> 00:54:57,999
An elder comes running from the ridge between rice paddies...

899
00:54:58,000 --> 00:55:00,499
and grabs my pants tightly.

900
00:55:00,500 --> 00:55:02,699
Who is this? He's handsome.

901
00:55:02,969 --> 00:55:05,270
Look at how he writes, not his looks.

902
00:55:05,569 --> 00:55:08,069
- In that mess... - My handwriting looks better, no?

903
00:55:08,639 --> 00:55:10,069
You can tell he practised a lot.

904
00:55:10,170 --> 00:55:12,639
His handwriting is neat, and the colours are distinguishable.

905
00:55:12,710 --> 00:55:15,480
You're right. He could aim for a contractual online lecture.

906
00:55:16,250 --> 00:55:19,020
Gosh, he looks good on camera.

907
00:55:19,619 --> 00:55:21,150
That could be his goal.

908
00:55:21,389 --> 00:55:22,420
Don't memorize it.

909
00:55:23,750 --> 00:55:26,920
Ms. Seo. Is Mr. Lee Jun Ho getting dropped for real?

910
00:55:27,290 --> 00:55:28,489
What a waste.

911
00:55:28,790 --> 00:55:30,959
No, he got in. He'll be coming to work here.

912
00:55:30,960 --> 00:55:32,359
The author, indicating himself...

913
00:55:32,360 --> 00:55:34,269
as "I", is in the room.

914
00:55:34,270 --> 00:55:36,868
That means this work is written...

915
00:55:36,869 --> 00:55:38,170
in the first person.

916
00:55:38,969 --> 00:55:40,699
I might have overdone it.

917
00:55:41,639 --> 00:55:44,009
You didn't. It was indeed shocking.

918
00:55:44,940 --> 00:55:46,539
So what if I sent him to college?

919
00:55:46,540 --> 00:55:49,750
I acted like an outstanding teacher or whatnot.

920
00:55:49,949 --> 00:55:51,850
There's no need to go that far.

921
00:55:53,480 --> 00:55:55,089
With Chanyoung High School's matter,

922
00:55:55,989 --> 00:55:57,218
my hands are full.

923
00:55:57,219 --> 00:55:58,920
I don't have time for Jun Ho.

924
00:55:59,889 --> 00:56:01,730
He's not a kid anymore.

925
00:56:03,159 --> 00:56:04,230
You're right.

926
00:56:04,699 --> 00:56:06,259
He's not.

927
00:56:09,569 --> 00:56:10,900
How about some drinks after work?

928
00:56:11,440 --> 00:56:12,469
It'll be on me.

929
00:56:13,270 --> 00:56:14,509
I have plans today.

930
00:56:31,360 --> 00:56:33,759
Oh, right. Here.

931
00:56:35,360 --> 00:56:36,959
This is for Hee Sun.

932
00:56:36,960 --> 00:56:40,029
Give it to her friend, not the reception.

933
00:56:40,130 --> 00:56:41,670
And pass on my apology.

934
00:56:42,170 --> 00:56:43,699
This envelope is packed.

935
00:56:44,100 --> 00:56:46,639
You'll be her most grateful guest, not the worst.

936
00:56:46,900 --> 00:56:48,440
- It's a disguise. - What?

937
00:56:48,670 --> 00:56:50,610
I felt bad for not attending, so I wrote a letter.

938
00:56:50,810 --> 00:56:52,839
There's not much money inside.

939
00:56:52,980 --> 00:56:55,580
A letter is quite dangerous, Hye Jin.

940
00:56:56,250 --> 00:56:58,379
- Sorry? - On our honeymoon,

941
00:56:58,380 --> 00:57:01,149
she cried on the plane for two hours...

942
00:57:01,150 --> 00:57:02,719
because of your letter.

943
00:57:04,219 --> 00:57:06,159
But you didn't have to write one.

944
00:57:06,420 --> 00:57:08,929
Everyone knows you even work on the weekends.

945
00:57:09,089 --> 00:57:10,560
You shouldn't use your wrist.

946
00:57:10,860 --> 00:57:11,860
Right, my wrist.

947
00:57:15,330 --> 00:57:16,528
Welcome.

948
00:57:16,529 --> 00:57:18,638
Hi.

949
00:57:18,639 --> 00:57:19,639
Hi.

950
00:57:19,640 --> 00:57:20,738
- So Young. - Yes?

951
00:57:20,739 --> 00:57:22,309
I'm sorry. Give me a moment with him.

952
00:57:22,310 --> 00:57:23,839
Take your time.

953
00:58:13,690 --> 00:58:15,259
Did you talk with your parents?

954
00:58:15,989 --> 00:58:17,029
I did.

955
00:58:17,830 --> 00:58:19,060
You won't give up, right?

956
00:58:19,730 --> 00:58:20,799
No.

957
00:58:21,270 --> 00:58:23,529
Since I'm job hunting, I'll apply to a bigger academy...

958
00:58:23,699 --> 00:58:25,170
to teach for the entrance exam.

959
00:58:25,770 --> 00:58:27,869
It's hard without work experience or connection,

960
00:58:28,210 --> 00:58:29,369
but I meet the qualifications.

961
00:58:31,139 --> 00:58:32,739
First off, let me apologize.

962
00:58:34,139 --> 00:58:35,179
For what?

963
00:58:35,480 --> 00:58:37,610
I'm sorry for crossing the line.

964
00:58:38,650 --> 00:58:39,719
I hurt you.

965
00:58:42,150 --> 00:58:43,250
How cool of you.

966
00:58:43,750 --> 00:58:45,190
I accept your apology.

967
00:58:46,460 --> 00:58:47,489
Thanks.

968
00:58:52,830 --> 00:58:53,859
Here.

969
00:58:53,860 --> 00:58:55,029
- Thank you. - Thank you.

970
00:59:02,739 --> 00:59:04,440
Listen carefully to what I'm about to say.

971
00:59:05,610 --> 00:59:06,639
Okay.

972
00:59:07,310 --> 00:59:09,049
It won't be a bed of roses from now on.

973
00:59:10,350 --> 00:59:11,380
What?

974
00:59:11,949 --> 00:59:13,779
Teamwork and loyalty between coworkers.

975
00:59:14,020 --> 00:59:15,190
Don't expect those.

976
00:59:15,449 --> 00:59:17,789
Teaching 3 hours on the weekday and 12 hours on the weekend...

977
00:59:17,790 --> 00:59:18,889
isn't everything.

978
00:59:19,489 --> 00:59:21,360
The hours after that will be much harder.

979
00:59:22,489 --> 00:59:24,399
No one will help you achieve the goal...

980
00:59:24,400 --> 00:59:26,060
of online lectures from a bigger academy.

981
00:59:26,529 --> 00:59:28,130
You're to improve by yourself.

982
00:59:30,330 --> 00:59:32,999
Wait. Are you hiring me?

983
00:59:33,000 --> 00:59:34,939
All teachers are your competition.

984
00:59:34,940 --> 00:59:36,569
But there are a limited number of students.

985
00:59:36,869 --> 00:59:39,080
We're sharing a limited amount of pie.

986
00:59:40,380 --> 00:59:43,380
Everyone besides yourself will attack...

987
00:59:44,750 --> 00:59:45,779
or use you.

988
00:59:46,549 --> 00:59:47,719
It will be either of the two.

989
00:59:48,150 --> 00:59:50,290
- In other words... - You'll do that, too, right?

990
00:59:52,089 --> 00:59:54,658
Don't you have words of hope or anything like that?

991
00:59:54,659 --> 00:59:57,029
You'll cry and laugh over a student quitting.

992
00:59:57,529 --> 01:00:00,259
Students quit when their grades rise or drop.

993
01:00:01,330 --> 01:00:02,569
They take credit for their grades rising.

994
01:00:03,429 --> 01:00:05,440
But they blame the teacher for their grades dropping.

995
01:00:06,639 --> 01:00:09,069
Students quit when the lecture is easy or hard.

996
01:00:09,739 --> 01:00:11,080
They think they're too good for the easy lecture.

997
01:00:12,009 --> 01:00:14,080
But they think the teacher is incompetent if it's hard.

998
01:00:15,980 --> 01:00:18,380
You should be grateful if the student quits without a word.

999
01:00:18,949 --> 01:00:20,678
They could make up a wicked rumour...

1000
01:00:20,679 --> 01:00:21,988
or mess up the class...

1001
01:00:21,989 --> 01:00:24,049
by making their friends quit together.

1002
01:00:25,790 --> 01:00:26,920
Rebuilding that class?

1003
01:00:27,420 --> 01:00:29,060
Nobody knows how long it'll take.

1004
01:00:30,089 --> 01:00:31,630
In the meantime, you'll earn nothing.

1005
01:00:32,199 --> 01:00:34,699
In the worst-case scenario, you'll get fired.

1006
01:00:38,400 --> 01:00:39,739
Did something happen?

1007
01:00:44,040 --> 01:00:45,509
You can tell your teacher anything.

1008
01:00:51,850 --> 01:00:52,949
Mr. Lee.

1009
01:00:54,619 --> 01:00:55,649
What?

1010
01:00:55,650 --> 01:00:57,319
Let me tell you one last thing.

1011
01:00:58,389 --> 01:01:00,420
What? Ms. Seo?

1012
01:01:00,520 --> 01:01:02,790
I've been teaching in Daechi-dong for 14 years.

1013
01:01:03,630 --> 01:01:06,699
Countless of my students have ranked first in school because of me.

1014
01:01:06,900 --> 01:01:10,170
As you know, I'm a pro at improving students' classes.

1015
01:01:11,799 --> 01:01:12,838
What's wrong?

1016
01:01:12,839 --> 01:01:15,069
The teacher hired with you is 32 years old...

1017
01:01:15,409 --> 01:01:17,040
with eight years of experience at academies.

1018
01:01:17,210 --> 01:01:19,479
She taught students without a month's break...

1019
01:01:19,480 --> 01:01:22,210
in Dongtan, Mapo, Mok-dong, and Junggye-dong.

1020
01:01:22,810 --> 01:01:24,548
She even wrote a textbook...

1021
01:01:24,549 --> 01:01:25,579
and has experience in all small, medium,

1022
01:01:25,580 --> 01:01:27,949
and large-sized online lectures.

1023
01:01:28,290 --> 01:01:29,548
She, too, is talented, having made...

1024
01:01:29,549 --> 01:01:31,920
many students nearby top their school every year.

1025
01:01:32,489 --> 01:01:33,790
Even I'm tensing up.

1026
01:01:37,489 --> 01:01:41,630
In short, you won't have time to tease me from now on.

1027
01:01:51,040 --> 01:01:53,380
You may leave now, Mr. Lee.

1028
01:01:58,779 --> 01:02:00,580
Right.

1029
01:02:00,679 --> 01:02:02,790
(Night Flight)

1030
01:02:43,190 --> 01:02:44,529
Why were you enraged?

1031
01:02:45,460 --> 01:02:46,529
You went all out on him.

1032
01:02:46,900 --> 01:02:48,900
No, I didn't. I just gave him advice.

1033
01:02:50,929 --> 01:02:52,069
Who was he?

1034
01:02:52,270 --> 01:02:55,238
The first student I taught after taking time off from college.

1035
01:02:55,239 --> 01:02:57,810
Oh, you mean that knucklehead?

1036
01:02:59,040 --> 01:03:00,080
He's not a knucklehead.

1037
01:03:05,779 --> 01:03:07,850
(Daechi Station)

1038
01:03:10,690 --> 01:03:12,619
(Daechi Chase)

1039
01:03:18,130 --> 01:03:19,959
- Good morning. - Good morning.

1040
01:03:19,960 --> 01:03:21,529
You've introduced yourselves, yes?

1041
01:03:21,699 --> 01:03:23,369
- Yes. - Yes, we're done.

1042
01:03:23,469 --> 01:03:24,469
Great.

1043
01:03:24,470 --> 01:03:28,040
Ms. Kim and Ms. Jung. I know you're both busy.

1044
01:03:28,270 --> 01:03:31,039
But please help the new teachers adjust well.

1045
01:03:31,040 --> 01:03:32,309
- I will. - Okay.

1046
01:03:32,310 --> 01:03:33,940
As for the new teachers,

1047
01:03:34,339 --> 01:03:36,548
decide which school students you want to start teaching.

1048
01:03:36,549 --> 01:03:37,948
The finals will start soon.

1049
01:03:37,949 --> 01:03:39,779
Soon-to-be sophomores will rush in.

1050
01:03:39,880 --> 01:03:42,388
You must prepare the parent information session yourself.

1051
01:03:42,389 --> 01:03:43,389
- Okay. - Okay.

1052
01:03:43,390 --> 01:03:45,888
Let me inform you of the schedule and classroom for Korean.

1053
01:03:45,889 --> 01:03:48,130
First off, there are no Korean classes on Monday.

1054
01:03:48,360 --> 01:03:51,129
We've gathered since it's your first day of work today.

1055
01:03:51,130 --> 01:03:52,658
But you don't have to come in on Mondays.

1056
01:03:52,659 --> 01:03:54,230
And Ms. Kim?

1057
01:03:54,429 --> 01:03:56,069
Oh, right.

1058
01:03:56,330 --> 01:03:58,999
You told me to look into it, so I did.

1059
01:03:59,000 --> 01:04:00,399
(Meeting Room 1)

1060
01:04:00,400 --> 01:04:01,940
Let's head to the teacher's room now.

1061
01:04:05,210 --> 01:04:06,509
Oh, hi.

1062
01:04:07,009 --> 01:04:08,049
Welcome.

1063
01:04:08,549 --> 01:04:11,350
I should call you Mr. Lee now, right?

1064
01:04:12,880 --> 01:04:13,920
I'm in your care.

1065
01:04:15,819 --> 01:04:16,889
Work hard, okay?

1066
01:04:17,089 --> 01:04:18,489
She was very upset.

1067
01:04:18,819 --> 01:04:19,819
Understood.

1068
01:04:20,619 --> 01:04:22,528
Go ahead. We'll talk again later.

1069
01:04:22,529 --> 01:04:23,560
All right.

1070
01:04:31,299 --> 01:04:32,969
Great. Let's go.

1071
01:04:34,170 --> 01:04:36,868
Focus more on creating your textbook, Mr. Lee.

1072
01:04:36,869 --> 01:04:38,539
To become successful as an academy teacher,

1073
01:04:38,540 --> 01:04:40,310
you must have your own textbook.

1074
01:04:40,679 --> 01:04:41,679
Got it.

1075
01:04:41,680 --> 01:04:42,749
Here are your desks.

1076
01:04:42,750 --> 01:04:44,179
Discuss and pick a desk.

1077
01:04:44,509 --> 01:04:46,719
- Should I take this desk? - Okay.

1078
01:04:51,319 --> 01:04:54,489
Ms. Seo. The director is asking for Mr. Lee.

1079
01:04:54,830 --> 01:04:56,759
I see. You may go, Mr. Lee.

1080
01:04:57,889 --> 01:04:59,060
Come to the director's office.

1081
01:05:09,170 --> 01:05:10,270
How does it feel?

1082
01:05:11,339 --> 01:05:13,080
You're a teacher now.

1083
01:05:14,639 --> 01:05:17,009
It's still awkward, but I'm having fun.

1084
01:05:18,380 --> 01:05:20,549
- Did you tell your parents? - Yes.

1085
01:05:21,719 --> 01:05:23,819
What did they say? They must've been shocked.

1086
01:05:25,659 --> 01:05:26,819
They're still processing it.

1087
01:05:27,060 --> 01:05:28,429
It did give them quite a shock.

1088
01:05:29,360 --> 01:05:31,190
So it's become a fact now.

1089
01:05:31,929 --> 01:05:33,599
You can drop the honorifics.

1090
01:05:33,600 --> 01:05:35,868
No way. I can't do that.

1091
01:05:35,869 --> 01:05:37,469
You're a real teacher now.

1092
01:05:39,069 --> 01:05:42,439
I'm deeply moved, you know?

1093
01:05:42,440 --> 01:05:44,669
You were once our academy's treasure,

1094
01:05:44,670 --> 01:05:46,138
symbol,

1095
01:05:46,139 --> 01:05:49,278
and identity as a student.

1096
01:05:49,279 --> 01:05:51,650
And you've returned as a teacher.

1097
01:05:53,049 --> 01:05:54,080
Thank you.

1098
01:05:55,119 --> 01:05:56,489
Speaking of which,

1099
01:05:56,949 --> 01:05:59,589
I have an offer to make.

1100
01:06:00,460 --> 01:06:01,460
What is it?

1101
01:06:01,461 --> 01:06:03,360
It's not a chance everyone gets.

1102
01:06:07,330 --> 01:06:08,929
I'd like to promote...

1103
01:06:09,270 --> 01:06:12,569
our academy by using you as the face.

1104
01:06:15,110 --> 01:06:16,139
What do you think?

1105
01:06:17,639 --> 01:06:19,540
Isn't Ms. Seo the face of this academy?

1106
01:06:19,779 --> 01:06:20,810
What?

1107
01:06:21,080 --> 01:06:23,479
Am I qualified for it?

1108
01:06:23,480 --> 01:06:25,980
Your story is the qualification.

1109
01:06:26,779 --> 01:06:29,790
It'll be a great stepping stone for a newbie teacher.

1110
01:06:29,989 --> 01:06:31,219
Lee Jun Ho's story?

1111
01:06:33,759 --> 01:06:34,759
I'm in.

1112
01:06:35,360 --> 01:06:36,889
I love how cool you are.

1113
01:06:38,299 --> 01:06:40,000
Promotion isn't everything.

1114
01:06:40,560 --> 01:06:43,868
Don't forget the best promotion is lecture skills and word of mouth.

1115
01:06:43,869 --> 01:06:45,699
Understood. I'll do my best.

1116
01:06:46,339 --> 01:06:47,339
Thank you.

1117
01:06:56,949 --> 01:06:58,219
How about this?

1118
01:07:01,449 --> 01:07:02,589
A teacher and student sally forth.

1119
01:07:04,589 --> 01:07:05,989
A miraculous teacher and student.

1120
01:07:06,989 --> 01:07:08,730
Isn't it a more touching story?

1121
01:07:43,290 --> 01:07:47,059
(The Midnight Romance in Hagwon)

1122
01:07:47,060 --> 01:07:48,468
You're getting on my nerves.

1123
01:07:48,469 --> 01:07:49,969
I can say the same to you.

1124
01:07:51,270 --> 01:07:52,599
Become my partner.

1125
01:07:52,600 --> 01:07:54,169
Are you asleep, Seo Hye Jin?

1126
01:07:54,170 --> 01:07:55,270
I can't do it.

1127
01:07:55,369 --> 01:07:57,368
There's an unexpected issue.

1128
01:07:57,369 --> 01:08:00,238
Choiseon Academy's director is holding an in-person lecture.

1129
01:08:00,239 --> 01:08:02,809
- Ms. Seo. - Ms. Seo is indeed outstanding.

1130
01:08:02,810 --> 01:08:04,249
Everyone is taking the challenge.

1131
01:08:04,250 --> 01:08:06,349
Did Mr. Pyo Sang Sub of Korean...

1132
01:08:06,350 --> 01:08:07,350
transfer schools?

1133
01:08:07,351 --> 01:08:08,749
Will the teacher and student concept...

1134
01:08:08,750 --> 01:08:10,249
bring an impact?

1135
01:08:10,250 --> 01:08:11,888
- I found it. - Lecture skills.

1136
01:08:11,889 --> 01:08:14,060
It's a great business trade for a teacher.

1137
01:08:14,159 --> 01:08:15,159
Goodness.

1138
01:08:16,190 --> 01:08:17,230
Is anyone here?
