 The Midnight Romance in Hagwon 

13
00:00:44,690 --> 00:00:46,040
 Episode 1 

14
00:00:46,040 --> 00:00:51,050
Make her first place, no matter what.

15
00:00:51,050 --> 00:00:56,030
Mother, as you know, the Korean course isn't the same anymore.

16
00:00:56,030 --> 00:00:57,890
It's getting a lot more difficult and—

17
00:00:57,890 --> 00:01:00,190
I'm saying that because I know.

18
00:01:02,300 --> 00:01:08,820
First of all, Ji Wu followed all levels without any trouble in the pre-learning stage.

19
00:01:08,820 --> 00:01:12,000
I see. She's diligent, for sure.

20
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,190
Her speech, writing, grammar, and literature are improving uniformly, and—

21
00:01:15,190 --> 00:01:17,860
I asked you if she could take first place.

22
00:01:19,690 --> 00:01:23,230
It's plain that Ji Wu's school's textbook itself is difficult but—

23
00:01:23,230 --> 00:01:25,530
The questions were kind of hard.

24
00:01:25,530 --> 00:01:28,710
Because the girls' high schools in Daechi-dong are so advanced,

25
00:01:28,710 --> 00:01:32,310
the high school teachers focus on distinguishing among the students.

26
00:01:32,310 --> 00:01:33,920
I looked through.

27
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:35,770
There were many questions on passages not in the textbook.

28
00:01:35,770 --> 00:01:39,950
This time, so that she will be able to adapt to a variety of passages in the recently distributed workbook—

29
00:01:39,950 --> 00:01:42,960
But you aren't giving it away for free.

30
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:44,400
Well...

31
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:48,060
She gets so flustered when she encounters unfamiliar text.

32
00:01:48,060 --> 00:01:50,740
I'm thinking of making her read whenever possible.

33
00:01:50,740 --> 00:01:53,240
I'm making her read "Written" for now.

34
00:01:53,240 --> 00:01:55,260
It's important to read as a habit, Mother.

35
00:01:55,260 --> 00:01:58,190
There's a recommended list of books we put together.

36
00:01:58,190 --> 00:02:00,550
Let's have a look.

37
00:02:01,430 --> 00:02:03,050
No.

38
00:02:03,050 --> 00:02:04,730
Pardon?

39
00:02:04,730 --> 00:02:06,600
I don't need it.

40
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:18,360
The parents are all different, but they usually ask these questions.

41
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:21,680
Should I ask you again since this is a simulation?

42
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:24,030
Reading is no longer a part of the student report,

43
00:02:24,030 --> 00:02:28,420
but you'd recommend she have her read?

44
00:02:28,420 --> 00:02:30,150
Well ...

45
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:33,320
You won't become her mentor or something, right?

46
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:37,570
But Team Leader, in order to get her used to various passages—

47
00:02:37,570 --> 00:02:40,940
What if none of the books you recommended were on the test?

48
00:02:41,870 --> 00:02:46,810
But they demand that I raise their grades when they have no knowledge—

49
00:02:46,810 --> 00:02:49,610
Just say you will.

50
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:55,310
Counseling seems a hundred times harder to me than teaching.

51
00:02:55,310 --> 00:02:57,650
Pick one of the example questions.

52
00:02:57,650 --> 00:02:59,660
Make it a tricky one.

53
00:03:02,490 --> 00:03:05,670
You want to make them fear as much as possible.

54
00:03:05,670 --> 00:03:09,340
Difficult passages, complicated answer choices, and vague comparisons.

55
00:03:09,340 --> 00:03:11,970
If getting first place despite all that only requires

56
00:03:11,970 --> 00:03:15,520
knowledge, culture, and common sense, people like us aren't necessary.

57
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:21,400
Simply say, "It's too late for your child to set foot into

58
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:27,230
the endless sea of knowledge."

59
00:03:27,230 --> 00:03:28,810
Okay?

60
00:03:28,810 --> 00:03:32,410
Make them believe in the power of creative instruction and training.

61
00:03:32,410 --> 00:03:34,450
Gosh, shall we finish the rest later?

62
00:03:35,430 --> 00:03:37,150
Oh, well...

63
00:03:37,780 --> 00:03:40,400
I think I was too harsh.

64
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:41,860
N-Not at all.

65
00:03:41,860 --> 00:03:45,380
Sending the kids to good schools makes us feel proud and worthy, right?

66
00:03:45,380 --> 00:03:47,270
Let's cheer up together.

67
00:03:51,100 --> 00:03:52,980
Right, that's true...

68
00:03:52,980 --> 00:03:56,310
Gosh, gosh, Team Leader Seo?

69
00:03:57,900 --> 00:03:59,490
Go to the consultation room.

70
00:03:59,490 --> 00:04:02,200
The mock test is almost over.

71
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:05,730
The Chanyeong High Gang. They insist on seeing you.

72
00:04:05,730 --> 00:04:06,960
Which room?

73
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:08,610
Room No. 3.

74
00:04:14,850 --> 00:04:18,360
 Hall of Fame 

75
00:04:19,090 --> 00:04:20,710
Here she comes.

76
00:04:20,710 --> 00:04:22,720
- Hello.
 - Hello.

77
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:24,700
You came.

78
00:04:27,580 --> 00:04:29,510
You must be tired of prepping them for the test.

79
00:04:29,510 --> 00:04:31,250
Not at all.

80
00:04:31,250 --> 00:04:34,280
You must be tired from the supplementary classes.

81
00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:36,550
I'm okay since the students are following my lead.

82
00:04:36,550 --> 00:04:38,860
What a relief.

83
00:04:40,710 --> 00:04:43,560
I stepped out for a while during the test, so—

84
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:46,070
- Well, Ms. Seo.
 - Yes, go ahead.

85
00:04:46,070 --> 00:04:50,640
We formed a separate study group at Ye Eun's.

86
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:52,810
- Yes.
 - I see.

87
00:04:52,810 --> 00:04:57,900
But we're worried since they're studying on their own.

88
00:04:58,530 --> 00:05:02,580
I understand Ha Yul, Jeong Su, and Ye Eun's weaknesses.

89
00:05:02,580 --> 00:05:04,080
I'm helping them improve on the side.

90
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:07,850
But still, we're worried.

91
00:05:07,850 --> 00:05:10,790
Half of Chanyeong High takes your class.

92
00:05:10,790 --> 00:05:14,060
We trust your class quality,

93
00:05:14,060 --> 00:05:18,790
but I think intensive care might be needed.

94
00:05:18,790 --> 00:05:20,810
For that reason,

95
00:05:20,810 --> 00:05:25,920
I was wondering if you could teach them separately.

96
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:28,970
So you're suggesting private group tutoring.

97
00:05:35,460 --> 00:05:37,610
- Ha Yul's mother.
 - Yes.

98
00:05:37,610 --> 00:05:39,860
And ladies.

99
00:05:39,860 --> 00:05:45,730
Please encourage the kids to like and respect their school teachers.

100
00:05:45,730 --> 00:05:51,020
Classroom teachers are the ones who create the tests at school.

101
00:05:51,020 --> 00:05:54,250
There's a teacher who was just appointed.

102
00:05:54,250 --> 00:05:56,630
We can't gauge their style completely.

103
00:05:56,630 --> 00:06:00,040
I analyzed their lessons as much as I can

104
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:03,070
and I trained the students enough so they can respond to

105
00:06:03,070 --> 00:06:06,210
new text or question styles.

106
00:06:06,210 --> 00:06:08,640
Everything is up to the kids now.

107
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:13,080
Allow me to excuse myself.

108
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:15,110
Okay.

109
00:06:17,820 --> 00:06:22,630
I was gifted Pu'er tea. It's really something else.

110
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:36,430
She defeated the invincible trio in three minutes.

111
00:06:36,430 --> 00:06:38,540
She started as a college student, a part-timer

112
00:06:38,540 --> 00:06:42,160
and worked in Daechi-dong all of her life.

113
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:45,780
She never gets a day off or even a break all year.

114
00:06:45,780 --> 00:06:47,830
I'm surprised that she's not passing out.

115
00:06:47,830 --> 00:06:49,160
Does she have any fun in life?

116
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:51,760
Don't feel too sorry for her.

117
00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:53,570
She's renegotiating her contract.

118
00:06:53,570 --> 00:06:56,720
Really? I didn't hear that.

119
00:07:04,940 --> 00:07:07,620
What other fun is there? That's all there is.

120
00:07:07,620 --> 00:07:08,940
I'm jealous.

121
00:07:08,940 --> 00:07:11,940
 Request for Approval of Business Report September, 2023 

122
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,100
 Report of Performance Evaluation of  Lee Myeong Ju, June-August 

123
00:07:15,570 --> 00:07:20,140
Choeseon Korean hired a teacher who's from an international high school.

124
00:07:20,140 --> 00:07:24,140
Team Leader Lee was directly hurt by it?

125
00:07:24,140 --> 00:07:25,960
That's correct.

126
00:07:27,320 --> 00:07:32,080
I have faith since you hired him, but

127
00:07:34,760 --> 00:07:38,890
do you think we should leave the contract the same?

128
00:07:39,710 --> 00:07:42,630
He's not on a set salary.

129
00:07:42,630 --> 00:07:46,130
Should a teacher be splitting the profit

130
00:07:46,130 --> 00:07:48,540
with the academy?

131
00:07:49,510 --> 00:07:54,150
We'll see the midterm result and give him a warning.

132
00:07:58,940 --> 00:08:01,320
We started advertising the recruitment today, right?

133
00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:02,760
Yes.

134
00:08:06,870 --> 00:08:12,820
It should send a message that our academy will no longer be defensive

135
00:08:12,820 --> 00:08:17,880
and will start attacking on this battlefield.

136
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:24,930
 Daechi Chase 

137
00:08:24,930 --> 00:08:28,820
They say you need a catfish in an old pond.

138
00:08:28,820 --> 00:08:33,930
I hope this stimulates the current teachers, too.

139
00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:44,390
Do we have to pay what they demand for the Line Apartments bus stop ad space?

140
00:08:44,390 --> 00:08:48,220
It's the most heavily trafficked bus stop in Daechi-dong.

141
00:08:49,210 --> 00:08:55,280
 Daechi Chase – Enjoy the competition 
 Teacher Seo Hyeji, the leading instructor 

142
00:09:20,310 --> 00:09:25,660
 Bus No. 38 is arriving shortly. 

143
00:09:28,460 --> 00:09:33,430
 Bus No. 16 is arriving shortly.
  Show me the miracle.

 Timing and Subtitles by Lessons in Love Team @ Viki.com 

145
00:09:46,820 --> 00:09:47,820
Hello.

146
00:09:47,820 --> 00:09:49,150
Hello, Ms. Seo.

147
00:09:49,150 --> 00:09:50,900
Hi. You didn't have the Korean exam today, did you?

148
00:09:50,900 --> 00:09:52,760
- No.
 - No.

149
00:09:52,760 --> 00:09:54,290
Hello.

150
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:04,890
- Hello.
 - Hello.

151
00:10:08,700 --> 00:10:11,520
You must be looking through the recruitment questions.

152
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:15,180
Maybe we should've only had killer questions and reduced the number of questions.

153
00:10:15,180 --> 00:10:17,500
Not making a mistake is a skill, too.

154
00:10:17,500 --> 00:10:20,080
It's not bad to have a variety of questions.

155
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:24,090
Looks like the Korean department is being too practical with the reading and grammar parts.

156
00:10:24,090 --> 00:10:25,420
Is that okay?

157
00:10:25,420 --> 00:10:28,340
I was thinking of changing the questions for my part, anyway.

158
00:10:28,340 --> 00:10:29,760
What?

159
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:32,450
I guess some teachers are selling previous tests.

160
00:10:32,450 --> 00:10:34,220
Previous tests?

161
00:10:34,220 --> 00:10:38,430
They're trying to figure out the test questions in the small lecturer community.

162
00:10:38,430 --> 00:10:40,660
They're trying to get some hints.

163
00:10:40,660 --> 00:10:42,000
That's why you wrote new questions

164
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,770
while preparing for the kids' exam the whole month?

165
00:10:43,770 --> 00:10:46,700
The demo lecture will determine the outcome, anyway. Why bother?

166
00:10:46,700 --> 00:10:48,110
It's still good, to be fair.

167
00:10:48,110 --> 00:10:50,860
I don't want there to be noise for no reason.

168
00:10:52,060 --> 00:10:53,750
Am I a bit late?

169
00:10:53,750 --> 00:10:55,800
Hello, sir.

170
00:10:58,750 --> 00:11:01,260
You were looking at the recruitment test questions.

171
00:11:01,260 --> 00:11:04,080
It will be printed tomorrow.

172
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:07,260
I'll keep everything sealed and store it.

173
00:11:07,260 --> 00:11:09,600
How about the demo lecture?

174
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:12,600
The ones who pass the written test will be given a time slot based on the subject.

175
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:15,340
It will be twenty minutes per person.

176
00:11:15,340 --> 00:11:18,920
Twenty minutes? Let's make it shorter.

177
00:11:19,740 --> 00:11:22,550
Ten minutes will be enough.

178
00:11:22,550 --> 00:11:27,330
You can actually tell in the first three minutes

179
00:11:27,330 --> 00:11:30,940
if they'll be the next leading force.

180
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:40,080
I've been thinking about it for a long time.

181
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:45,070
The student population is declining, and there are academies on every street corner.

182
00:11:45,070 --> 00:11:49,730
What would be our weapon in this fierce competition?

183
00:11:49,730 --> 00:11:52,530
Where does our future lie?

184
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:59,450
I've been thinking a thousand times, but there's only one answer.

185
00:11:59,450 --> 00:12:04,280
The academy's asset is you, lecturers.

186
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:09,710
The college entrance exam is the student and their parents'

187
00:12:09,710 --> 00:12:11,720
first encounter with their future social status.

188
00:12:11,720 --> 00:12:13,730
For them,

189
00:12:14,850 --> 00:12:18,320
you need to be like Polaris.

190
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:21,500
Team Leader Lee, what do we need to be?

191
00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:23,270
Polaris.

192
00:12:23,970 --> 00:12:27,570
The students' fandom and the parents' trust

193
00:12:27,570 --> 00:12:33,060
need to shine without wavering at all.

194
00:12:33,060 --> 00:12:35,050
Lecturing skills?

195
00:12:35,050 --> 00:12:37,000
I can teach them that easily.

196
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:40,850
But what I'm looking for is a natural charisma.

197
00:12:40,850 --> 00:12:43,870
A natural charisma that you can't acquire.

198
00:12:43,870 --> 00:12:45,860
Their own power.

199
00:12:45,860 --> 00:12:48,840
Some people think about their charisma and strength

200
00:12:48,840 --> 00:12:52,120
for a long time and bring it to the surface.

201
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:56,900
I'll be looking for that exceptional sense.

202
00:12:58,990 --> 00:13:03,910
Before I face the important challenge of opening the Gangbuk branch,

203
00:13:03,910 --> 00:13:06,410
I'm having a big event—

204
00:13:06,410 --> 00:13:07,600
Erm ...

205
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:08,670
What is it?

206
00:13:08,670 --> 00:13:11,960
Team Leader Seo might want to come out.

207
00:13:12,640 --> 00:13:14,330
Ha Yul is crying, ma'am.

208
00:13:14,330 --> 00:13:16,500
Crying? Ha Yul is?

209
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:18,600
Excuse me.

210
00:13:25,190 --> 00:13:26,590
What's going on?

211
00:13:26,590 --> 00:13:27,990
She took a test today. Why is she crying?

212
00:13:27,990 --> 00:13:29,640
Did she make a mistake?

213
00:13:29,640 --> 00:13:33,600
I'm not sure. I keep asking her, but she won't answer.

214
00:13:35,540 --> 00:13:37,350
Ha Yul.

215
00:13:37,350 --> 00:13:40,400
Ha Yul... What's wrong? Huh?

216
00:13:40,400 --> 00:13:42,340
Get up.

217
00:13:43,710 --> 00:13:47,250
It's okay, Ha Yul. Look at me.

218
00:13:47,250 --> 00:13:48,730
Did you make a mistake?

219
00:13:48,730 --> 00:13:51,310
It's not that.

220
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:56,370
Well...

221
00:13:57,060 --> 00:13:59,580
it's question No. 11.

222
00:14:00,980 --> 00:14:03,540
 We are gradually feeling exhilarated. 

223
00:14:06,790 --> 00:14:09,390
Did they say the answer is No. 5?

224
00:14:10,660 --> 00:14:12,920
Did you choose No. 2?

225
00:14:12,920 --> 00:14:14,180
Yes.

226
00:14:14,180 --> 00:14:18,010
Can you explain it to me?

227
00:14:18,010 --> 00:14:19,630
Why you chose No. 2?

228
00:14:19,630 --> 00:14:21,230
The "feeling exhilarated" part.

229
00:14:21,230 --> 00:14:22,850
Yes.

230
00:14:23,790 --> 00:14:29,450
The narrator is a poor farmer and he sold the cow because he was struggling.

231
00:14:29,450 --> 00:14:31,010
That's right.

232
00:14:31,010 --> 00:14:33,840
But he said he was feeling exhilarated.

233
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:36,010
What did you think it meant?

234
00:14:36,010 --> 00:14:37,470
He was being ironic.

235
00:14:37,470 --> 00:14:39,070
That's right.

236
00:14:39,070 --> 00:14:43,390
Just like how Kim So Wol kept saying he forgot the one he missed in his poem.

237
00:14:44,930 --> 00:14:46,860
It's okay. You didn't do anything wrong.

238
00:14:46,860 --> 00:14:50,150
You would've been confused even if you looked at all the options.

239
00:14:51,960 --> 00:14:56,390
Could you tell the school teacher what you just told me?

240
00:14:56,390 --> 00:14:58,200
Me?

241
00:15:00,170 --> 00:15:03,220
I'm scared. I don't want to.

242
00:15:03,220 --> 00:15:06,560
What if I get a bad write-up on my transcript?

243
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:09,960
Listen, the exam just ended today.

244
00:15:09,960 --> 00:15:13,870
You can get it fixed before the grades come out, right?

245
00:15:25,030 --> 00:15:26,810
- Ha Yul.
 - Mom.

246
00:15:26,810 --> 00:15:28,770
Well done.

247
00:15:29,570 --> 00:15:30,860
Why didn't you read my message?

248
00:15:30,860 --> 00:15:34,460
I put the phone on silent since I was in the study room.

249
00:15:34,460 --> 00:15:36,570
Good job.

250
00:15:36,570 --> 00:15:39,350
You must be hungry. Let's get going.

251
00:15:40,090 --> 00:15:42,670
I felt stuffy when we first moved here,

252
00:15:42,670 --> 00:15:45,500
but I've become used to it now.

253
00:15:45,500 --> 00:15:49,630
Let's suffer a little longer and get out of this neighborhood.

254
00:15:49,630 --> 00:15:53,650
Dad must be tired from commuting, too.

255
00:15:53,650 --> 00:15:55,750
It's all up to you, Ha Yul.

256
00:15:55,750 --> 00:15:58,390
I've been praying a lot.

257
00:16:01,420 --> 00:16:03,700
Is Dad home?

258
00:16:03,700 --> 00:16:05,620
Of course, he is.

259
00:16:06,870 --> 00:16:08,990
What's wrong?

260
00:16:08,990 --> 00:16:10,860
What is it?

261
00:16:11,660 --> 00:16:13,980
Hey, Ha Yul.

262
00:16:13,980 --> 00:16:16,750
What's wrong? Did something happen?

263
00:16:16,750 --> 00:16:18,400
What?

264
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:20,580
What's going on?

265
00:16:20,580 --> 00:16:23,000
 Ha Yul's Mother 

266
00:16:30,090 --> 00:16:31,880
Yes, ma'am.

267
00:16:31,880 --> 00:16:34,230
 Yes, I heard from Ha Yul. 

268
00:16:34,230 --> 00:16:36,500
 Is it really true what you said? 

269
00:16:36,500 --> 00:16:39,380
Are there really two answers?

270
00:16:39,380 --> 00:16:42,600
Yes, Mother. It was an expected question, too.

271
00:16:43,580 --> 00:16:45,670
Yes, the students are supposed to raise the question.

272
00:16:45,670 --> 00:16:47,820
It's a fair complaint.

273
00:16:49,690 --> 00:16:51,510
No, she won't be disadvantaged.

274
00:16:51,510 --> 00:16:54,110
I'll try talking to her for now.

275
00:17:17,090 --> 00:17:20,380
Hey, Ye Eun's Mom. It's Ha Yul's Mom.

276
00:17:20,380 --> 00:17:22,390
Did you hear the news?

277
00:17:22,390 --> 00:17:26,620
Ha Yul understood the concepts well when I checked yesterday.

278
00:17:26,620 --> 00:17:28,360
It's a shame she'll miss the score.

279
00:17:28,360 --> 00:17:32,570
And I'm afraid she'll fall out of favor by complaining and not get the score.

280
00:17:32,570 --> 00:17:34,830
It's killing me.

281
00:17:34,830 --> 00:17:37,010
I've known Ha Yul since the pre-learning stage.

282
00:17:37,010 --> 00:17:38,640
I'm sure she'll handle it calmly.

283
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:43,620
Everyone says not to stir the pot in consideration of early admission.

284
00:17:43,620 --> 00:17:47,690
But I'm not sure if the students should be handling this.

285
00:17:47,690 --> 00:17:50,780
He'll listen if they ask politely.

286
00:17:50,780 --> 00:17:53,850
Please trust the students and the teachers.

287
00:17:56,050 --> 00:17:58,760
How are we supposed to trust them?

288
00:18:00,220 --> 00:18:03,100
 I'm screwed, Mom. 

289
00:18:03,100 --> 00:18:04,680
Didn't you hear?

290
00:18:04,680 --> 00:18:06,880
Is that how the academy taught you?

291
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:13,430
We're just saying...

292
00:18:14,740 --> 00:18:16,590
this "exhilarated" was to express—

293
00:18:16,590 --> 00:18:19,350
That's why I explained it many times.

294
00:18:19,350 --> 00:18:22,640
It's a paradox since it doesn't logically make sense.

295
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:27,730
Hey.

296
00:18:28,330 --> 00:18:30,070
Seong Ha Yul.

297
00:18:32,920 --> 00:18:34,140
But...

298
00:18:34,140 --> 00:18:35,920
But?

299
00:18:39,640 --> 00:18:41,870
Do you have any more questions?

300
00:18:44,130 --> 00:18:45,680
Go.

301
00:18:46,990 --> 00:18:48,990
Aren't you going to bow?

302
00:18:57,150 --> 00:19:01,030
I can't stand Ha Yul being upset.

303
00:19:01,030 --> 00:19:03,250
Other students went to him, too,

304
00:19:03,250 --> 00:19:06,400
but they decided to give up since he was so adamant.

305
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:09,730
Their grades probably don't depend on a question or two—

306
00:19:09,730 --> 00:19:11,090
Calm down, ma'am.

307
00:19:11,090 --> 00:19:13,620
She can easily overcome it with the finals and performance assessment.

308
00:19:13,620 --> 00:19:17,230
She's mentally destroyed, I said!

309
00:19:20,650 --> 00:19:23,430
Would you like to contact the research director

310
00:19:23,430 --> 00:19:25,550
to request an academic committee meeting?

311
00:19:25,550 --> 00:19:29,150
We don't want to escalate things like that.

312
00:19:41,090 --> 00:19:44,850
Give me the teacher's number.

313
00:19:50,930 --> 00:19:55,030
I don't know what's wrong with this world.

314
00:19:55,030 --> 00:19:58,010
It's just a 10th-grade midterm question.

315
00:19:58,010 --> 00:20:01,840
You need to change the answer since you can't change the world.

316
00:20:02,670 --> 00:20:04,190
 Mr. Pyo Sang Seob of Chanyeong High 

317
00:20:04,190 --> 00:20:05,840
What are you doing?

318
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:07,060
Will you step in yourself?

319
00:20:07,060 --> 00:20:09,180
Team Leader Seo, don't do it. Don't.

320
00:20:09,180 --> 00:20:12,450
Restrict... Restrict the caller ID, at least.

321
00:20:12,450 --> 00:20:14,310
Hello?

322
00:20:14,310 --> 00:20:17,330
Is this Mr. Pyo Sang Seob's phone?

323
00:20:17,330 --> 00:20:18,860
It is.

324
00:20:18,860 --> 00:20:21,150
 I see. Good afternoon. 

325
00:20:21,150 --> 00:20:24,970
 I wanted to ask you about question No. 11 from the midterm exam. 

326
00:20:24,970 --> 00:20:27,940
From the students' perspective—

327
00:20:28,850 --> 00:20:30,340
Pardon?

328
00:20:32,660 --> 00:20:34,240
Yes.

329
00:20:35,050 --> 00:20:37,340
Yes, got it.

330
00:20:38,160 --> 00:20:40,230
What? What did he say?

331
00:20:41,610 --> 00:20:43,650
What did he say?

332
00:20:43,650 --> 00:20:46,000
He wants to talk in person.

333
00:20:46,930 --> 00:20:51,110
He knows you'll hesitate to come in because of the transcripts.

334
00:20:51,110 --> 00:20:54,420
Tell the mothers to contact the research director.

335
00:20:55,560 --> 00:20:58,360
They don't want to escalate things, apparently.

336
00:20:58,360 --> 00:21:01,910
So? You're going?

337
00:21:04,690 --> 00:21:06,480
Team Leader Seo!

338
00:21:07,940 --> 00:21:09,720
Team Leader Seo!

339
00:21:13,860 --> 00:21:17,100
Hye Jin, the school has its protocols.

340
00:21:17,100 --> 00:21:20,990
It'll be more difficult to fix it after the grades come out.

341
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:25,150
But giving it time won't make you cowardly.

342
00:21:25,150 --> 00:21:27,000
I'll be right back.

343
00:21:41,190 --> 00:21:48,380
 Chanyeong High School 

344
00:22:34,600 --> 00:22:40,720
 Teachers' Office 

345
00:22:43,680 --> 00:22:46,580
They must've studied ahead of time.

346
00:22:46,580 --> 00:22:49,550
They don't focus since they already studied it. But they forget immediately.

347
00:22:49,550 --> 00:22:53,380
Excuse me, I'm here to see Mr. Pyo Sang Seob.

348
00:22:53,380 --> 00:22:55,900
Okay.

349
00:22:55,900 --> 00:23:00,080
Mr. Pyo, someone's here to see you.

350
00:23:06,950 --> 00:23:08,640
Yes.

351
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:11,070
I'm Pyo Sang Seob.

352
00:23:11,070 --> 00:23:13,080
Hello, sir.

353
00:23:13,080 --> 00:23:15,180
Hello.

354
00:23:15,180 --> 00:23:18,890
Well, how can I help you?

355
00:23:18,890 --> 00:23:22,340
I contacted you about question No. 11.

356
00:23:32,470 --> 00:23:34,800
Have a seat here first.

357
00:23:34,800 --> 00:23:37,480
- Yes, go ahead.
 - Excuse us.

358
00:23:37,480 --> 00:23:39,780
Okay, have a seat here.

359
00:23:39,780 --> 00:23:41,070
Here?

360
00:23:41,070 --> 00:23:43,810
Yes, it's not like we can't talk.

361
00:23:43,810 --> 00:23:46,070
Let's keep it transparent.

362
00:23:46,070 --> 00:23:47,810
Have a seat.

363
00:24:01,680 --> 00:24:05,660
You're a young mother.

364
00:24:08,530 --> 00:24:10,810
Was there a problem with the question?

365
00:24:10,810 --> 00:24:13,920
- It's not that there's a problem— 
 - The thing is...

366
00:24:14,540 --> 00:24:17,430
it's about basic literary concepts.

367
00:24:18,210 --> 00:24:20,270
It requires you to find the figurative language

368
00:24:20,270 --> 00:24:24,150
that reveals the inner truth through a paradoxical expression.

369
00:24:24,150 --> 00:24:28,300
Would other Korean teachers have the same opinion?

370
00:24:29,160 --> 00:24:33,340
The questions were proofread multiple times by other Korean teachers.

371
00:24:33,340 --> 00:24:37,020
I'm not asking you how the questions were created.

372
00:24:37,020 --> 00:24:41,740
I'm asking if other teachers interpret it the same way.

373
00:24:47,320 --> 00:24:48,850
Okay...

374
00:24:51,610 --> 00:24:54,390
It's question No. 11.

375
00:24:56,730 --> 00:24:59,250
This is Shin Gyeong Rim's "Farmer."

376
00:24:59,250 --> 00:25:01,410
It was set in the 1970s.

377
00:25:01,410 --> 00:25:03,750
When the agricultural villages were being destroyed.

378
00:25:03,750 --> 00:25:07,710
The narrator of the poem was put into a frustrating and difficult situation.

379
00:25:07,710 --> 00:25:10,240
He's a farmer who even sold his cow.

380
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:12,020
He's utterly devastated.

381
00:25:12,020 --> 00:25:16,570
But he described his feeling as "exhilarating."

382
00:25:17,480 --> 00:25:19,410
It's a contradiction.

383
00:25:19,410 --> 00:25:22,190
This is a paradox.

384
00:25:22,190 --> 00:25:26,990
If you don't understand, look at the answer, No. 5.

385
00:25:26,990 --> 00:25:32,080
Like how it says, "We need to say good bye for the sake of our love."

386
00:25:33,090 --> 00:25:36,890
It is a contradictory expression, but it is too much to look at it only as a paradox.

387
00:25:36,890 --> 00:25:41,270
Because in the sentence "feeling exhilarated" isn't contradictory.

388
00:25:41,270 --> 00:25:45,310
If you think of it as a contradictory figure of speech

389
00:25:45,310 --> 00:25:48,640
couldn't No. 2 be the answer, too?

390
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:50,520
It is irony.

391
00:25:58,580 --> 00:26:01,850
You must've studied literature, Mother.

392
00:26:01,850 --> 00:26:03,480
No, I'm not.

393
00:26:03,480 --> 00:26:06,320
You mean you're not a mother,

394
00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:09,070
or you didn't study literature?

395
00:26:10,130 --> 00:26:12,130
Neither.

396
00:26:14,690 --> 00:26:17,550
Please leave a business card with me.

397
00:26:23,260 --> 00:26:26,120
Aren't you from an academy?

398
00:26:26,120 --> 00:26:29,290
Many academies predicted this question.

399
00:26:32,700 --> 00:26:37,310
You mean it was within the defense zone?

400
00:26:37,310 --> 00:26:42,450
I'm only here to discuss the question with you.

401
00:26:43,250 --> 00:26:45,400
I've never heard of...

402
00:26:45,400 --> 00:26:50,200
a school teacher discussing an exam question with an academy lecturer.

403
00:26:50,200 --> 00:26:52,870
Maybe the Korean teachers can have another look—

404
00:26:52,870 --> 00:26:55,710
I explained it enough to the students.

405
00:26:55,710 --> 00:27:00,980
There's clearly a contradiction between reality and poetic expression, so it is a paradox.

406
00:27:00,980 --> 00:27:05,880
- If the students understood the narrator felt devastated— 
 - I already told you.

407
00:27:05,880 --> 00:27:07,410
This is a matter of literary concepts.

408
00:27:07,410 --> 00:27:09,490
It's about the concepts,

409
00:27:09,490 --> 00:27:14,370
but you also need to understand the historical context and assume the narrator's feelings, too.

410
00:27:14,370 --> 00:27:16,720
I also found the question structure...

411
00:27:17,620 --> 00:27:19,710
fresh.

412
00:27:23,090 --> 00:27:27,250
I never asked you to assess the quality of the questions.

413
00:27:36,310 --> 00:27:41,000
"I didn't know what kind of questions you'd write since you're a new teacher here."

414
00:27:41,950 --> 00:27:44,300
That's how it sounded to me.

415
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:49,200
You're saying you didn't see this coming, right?

416
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:53,260
You collected exam data from the last several years and analyzed it.

417
00:27:53,260 --> 00:27:57,270
I've been analyzing it respectfully every semester.

418
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:03,930
That  Is  irony.

419
00:28:03,930 --> 00:28:08,900
You're saying "respectful" when you came to challenge the school.

420
00:28:08,900 --> 00:28:10,510
Challenge?

421
00:28:10,510 --> 00:28:13,680
Choosing questions, difficulty levels, and the transition to the college entrance exam.

422
00:28:13,680 --> 00:28:16,500
Chanyeong High is exceptional in all of these.

423
00:28:16,500 --> 00:28:18,460
I never dared to challenge it.

424
00:28:18,460 --> 00:28:21,840
But this... This isn't challenging?

425
00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:24,640
I said I was here to discuss.

426
00:28:25,940 --> 00:28:28,880
Do you know how many students came by today?

427
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:31,110
I'm not disagreeing with what you said.

428
00:28:31,110 --> 00:28:32,950
Let's not cross the line.

429
00:28:32,950 --> 00:28:36,530
- Aren't you ashamed at all?
 - I'd be ashamed if I were wrong.

430
00:28:36,530 --> 00:28:38,750
But you say only either paradox or irony is valid—

431
00:28:38,750 --> 00:28:42,550
You make the students beg for scores and try to manipulate grades.

432
00:28:42,550 --> 00:28:45,510
- Aren't you ashamed? 
- Well, Mr. Pyo.

433
00:28:45,510 --> 00:28:50,550
Don't do this here. I think you should talk somewhere else.

434
00:28:50,550 --> 00:28:52,300
Should we talk somewhere else?

435
00:28:52,300 --> 00:28:53,460
Why should I?

436
00:28:53,460 --> 00:28:56,800
I think I understand why you wrote the question this way.

437
00:28:58,230 --> 00:29:00,960
What is it? What's the reason?

438
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:02,960
Because it's dated.

439
00:29:07,350 --> 00:29:08,440
What?

440
00:29:08,440 --> 00:29:10,890
Questions that obsess over concepts like personification,

441
00:29:10,890 --> 00:29:13,990
figurative speech, paradox, and irony have

442
00:29:13,990 --> 00:29:16,690
totally disappeared from the college entrance exam.

443
00:29:16,690 --> 00:29:18,840
Because it's dated.

444
00:29:18,840 --> 00:29:22,000
But I diligently taught these concepts to my students

445
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:28,220
because there are always teachers who teach them this in school.

446
00:29:30,540 --> 00:29:32,890
 Which academy is she from? 

447
00:29:34,010 --> 00:29:36,000
 Doesn't she look familiar? 

448
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:37,630
 Is that true, by the way? 

449
00:29:37,630 --> 00:29:39,600
 They don't use them in college entrance exams? 

450
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:41,690
 I learned that back in my day. 

451
00:29:41,690 --> 00:29:45,120
But you're unwilling to reconsider.

452
00:29:45,120 --> 00:29:47,240
Is it because you know

453
00:29:47,240 --> 00:29:51,350
that the students can't complain aggressively because of the transcripts?

454
00:29:57,660 --> 00:30:00,320
How dare you criticize public education?

455
00:30:05,540 --> 00:30:07,410
Hold on, guys. Go, go.

456
00:30:07,410 --> 00:30:09,460
Ma'am, I'm here to ask a question.

457
00:30:09,460 --> 00:30:11,020
 Later. 

458
00:30:11,710 --> 00:30:13,640
 Five minutes? No, come back in 10 minutes. 

459
00:30:13,640 --> 00:30:16,250
 - Ma'am.
 - Listen to me. Go, go. 

460
00:30:16,250 --> 00:30:18,210
 Hurry. Go. 

461
00:30:18,210 --> 00:30:20,700
Am I the bad guy for making the students beg for scores,

462
00:30:20,700 --> 00:30:24,260
or are you bad for self-aggrandizing using the kids held hostage by their transcripts?

463
00:30:24,260 --> 00:30:27,700
Daebak. She's crazy. She destroyed him.

464
00:30:27,700 --> 00:30:29,140
By the way, what's "aggrandizing"?

465
00:30:29,140 --> 00:30:30,370
Shit, I don't know.

466
00:30:30,370 --> 00:30:32,500
Is it some kind of fish?

467
00:30:32,500 --> 00:30:34,790
Mr. Pyo, calm down first.

468
00:30:34,790 --> 00:30:36,280
Don't do this here.

469
00:30:36,280 --> 00:30:40,210
How dare I challenge or cause confusion?

470
00:30:40,210 --> 00:30:41,490
That's not it at all.

471
00:30:41,490 --> 00:30:44,570
What public education aims for is our measuring stick.

472
00:30:44,570 --> 00:30:46,280
Hey!

473
00:30:47,030 --> 00:30:50,060
You should stop, too. The school will look into it.

474
00:30:50,060 --> 00:30:51,910
What do you mean to look into it?

475
00:30:51,910 --> 00:30:54,980
I request a re-test.

476
00:30:54,980 --> 00:30:57,740
Okay, okay. You can leave now. Go.

477
00:30:57,740 --> 00:31:00,310
What do you mean, "Okay"?

478
00:31:00,310 --> 00:31:02,250
I'll get going.

479
00:31:04,530 --> 00:31:06,940
I ask you to reconsider wisely.

480
00:31:06,940 --> 00:31:09,030
Thank you.

481
00:31:10,370 --> 00:31:12,370
Geez, wisely?

482
00:31:13,940 --> 00:31:15,620
Mr. Pyo, you can't touch her.

483
00:31:15,620 --> 00:31:17,790
- Wisely?
 - You can't do this.

484
00:31:17,790 --> 00:31:19,820
Let go. You need to let go.

485
00:31:19,820 --> 00:31:22,100
- You can't do this.
 - Let go of me!

486
00:31:22,100 --> 00:31:23,790
You can't touch her!

487
00:31:23,790 --> 00:31:25,690
One more thing.

488
00:31:26,920 --> 00:31:29,170
The text from the exam

489
00:31:29,170 --> 00:31:32,960
included medieval language that's not in the textbook.

490
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:38,370
Didn't you write that question to say, "Didn't you learn this at the academy?"

491
00:31:40,760 --> 00:31:43,560
There are other ways to complain.

492
00:31:50,260 --> 00:31:52,470
You people are parasites.

493

 Supplements for exam-takers 

495
00:34:09,040 --> 00:34:10,700
- Hello.
 - Hi.

496
00:34:10,700 --> 00:34:12,920
Hello.

497
00:34:37,170 --> 00:34:41,240
So, where are you looking for a starter home?

498
00:34:41,240 --> 00:34:43,670
Gangseo.

499
00:34:43,670 --> 00:34:45,070
Huh? It's not Daechi-dong?

500
00:34:45,070 --> 00:34:47,610
Why not? You can get a good employee loan.

501
00:34:47,610 --> 00:34:48,890
Hey.

502
00:34:49,590 --> 00:34:53,720
How could a second-year employee get a home in Daechi-dong?

503
00:34:53,720 --> 00:34:55,710
What does your family say?

504
00:34:55,710 --> 00:34:59,170
They said they'd help me get a loan using their house as collateral.

505
00:34:59,170 --> 00:35:00,830
So...

506
00:35:01,460 --> 00:35:03,330
why don't you take it, then?

507
00:35:04,310 --> 00:35:06,960
You're incapable of thinking at all.

508
00:35:06,960 --> 00:35:08,710
Why? What?

509
00:35:08,710 --> 00:35:11,070
My sister is strongly opposed to it and—

510
00:35:11,070 --> 00:35:12,720
Oh, Park Tae Hui?

511
00:35:12,720 --> 00:35:14,440
She's so venomous.

512
00:35:14,440 --> 00:35:20,020
The apartments here are our parents' only retirement plan and pride.

513
00:35:20,020 --> 00:35:21,980
Park Tae Hyeon isn't like you. He won't take that from them.

514
00:35:21,980 --> 00:35:23,830
Does your girlfriend agree, too?

515
00:35:23,830 --> 00:35:26,290
Well, I should persuade her. Although it won't be easy.

516
00:35:26,290 --> 00:35:29,130
She says she never lived outside of Gangnam.

517
00:35:29,130 --> 00:35:31,410
Gosh, who has?

518
00:35:32,180 --> 00:35:35,020
Hey, you'd better think carefully.

519
00:35:35,020 --> 00:35:37,240
It's hard to return to this neighborhood once you leave.

520
00:35:37,240 --> 00:35:38,940
Hey.

521
00:35:38,940 --> 00:35:41,840
You remained in the ivory tower for your studies.

522
00:35:41,840 --> 00:35:43,570
You can't just say stuff like that.

523
00:35:43,570 --> 00:35:46,620
I know better since I stayed in school.

524
00:35:48,330 --> 00:35:51,240
Hey, do you see those guys?

525
00:35:51,240 --> 00:35:53,080
Yes.

526
00:35:53,080 --> 00:35:57,490
 Seoul National University School of Medicine  
They start wearing that as soon as the hottest months of summer end.

527
00:35:57,490 --> 00:36:01,410
I suppose people's envy is worth enduring the pain of heat rash.

528
00:36:01,410 --> 00:36:02,780
I can understand.

529
00:36:02,780 --> 00:36:04,500
If only math didn't stop me.

530
00:36:04,500 --> 00:36:06,750
Wow. It's the medical school jacket, even.

531
00:36:06,750 --> 00:36:08,440
It will be a family heirloom.

532
00:36:08,440 --> 00:36:11,070
At least, it serves as a letter of credit.

533
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:14,060
Just check out exam-taker forums.

534
00:36:14,060 --> 00:36:18,090
Most of them are elite university students, not exam takers.

535
00:36:18,090 --> 00:36:20,390
Nothing's more fun than acting like the king there.

536
00:36:20,390 --> 00:36:22,710
Get to the point. Get to the point.

537
00:36:22,710 --> 00:36:27,600
If I were you, I'd put on a thick skin and never leave Daechi-dong.

538
00:36:27,600 --> 00:36:30,290
Even if the whole country goes down,

539
00:36:30,290 --> 00:36:33,120
this area never will as long as that desire lasts.

540
00:36:33,120 --> 00:36:38,200
It's fine not to leave, but why depend on the parents to do it?

541
00:36:38,200 --> 00:36:42,310
Hey, do you think being a self-made man these days is possible?

542
00:36:42,310 --> 00:36:44,160
Well, why not?

543
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:45,470
I think I can.

544
00:36:45,470 --> 00:36:47,850
- Seriously.
 - So you're a millennial, huh?

545
00:36:47,850 --> 00:36:49,390
Will you become a YouTuber or something?

546
00:36:49,390 --> 00:36:51,190
Come on.

547
00:36:53,570 --> 00:36:58,950
Th-This bastard might be able to... do that.

548
00:37:00,520 --> 00:37:02,300
Please don't.

549
00:37:02,300 --> 00:37:04,420
- The miracle of Grade 8.
 - The miracle of Grade 8.

550
00:37:04,420 --> 00:37:09,250
The miraculous idiot whom his mother gave birth to and Seo Hye Jin raised.

551
00:37:10,050 --> 00:37:12,400
You sure were impressive.

552
00:37:13,280 --> 00:37:14,800
Let's drink.

553
00:37:55,300 --> 00:38:01,400
 Korea University College of Political Science and Economics - Lee Jun Ho, Graduate of Chanyeong High] 

554
00:38:07,960 --> 00:38:09,740
Thanks for the wine. Get home safely.

555
00:38:09,740 --> 00:38:12,530
Okay, bye.

556
00:38:15,010 --> 00:38:19,960
You're a refugee the moment you leave your parents.

557
00:38:19,960 --> 00:38:21,780
You need to brace yourself.

558
00:38:21,780 --> 00:38:23,980
I won't leave, okay?

559
00:38:23,980 --> 00:38:27,670
Okay, let's be cool.

560
00:38:28,370 --> 00:38:32,580
Hey, I'll establish myself here on my own.

561
00:38:33,510 --> 00:38:36,860
The gold mine that never dries out is here.

562
00:38:36,860 --> 00:38:40,680
All the cash in this country is concentrated in Gangnam Plastic Surgery Row and Academy Row.

563
00:38:40,680 --> 00:38:42,250
I'll make that mine.

564
00:38:42,250 --> 00:38:46,020
Wow, let me know if you figure out how.

565
00:38:46,020 --> 00:38:49,410
Might as well save this poor grad student, too.

566
00:38:49,410 --> 00:38:51,840
Go home. I need to stop by somewhere.

567
00:38:51,840 --> 00:38:53,060
What?

568
00:38:53,060 --> 00:38:54,750
Let's go together if you're getting another drink!

569
00:38:54,750 --> 00:38:57,120
I'm not. Go home.

570
00:39:06,030 --> 00:39:08,320
 You people are parasites. 

571
00:39:10,030 --> 00:39:12,480
Give me a break.

572
00:39:12,480 --> 00:39:14,660
Who are you talking to?

573
00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:17,880
Huh?

574
00:39:17,880 --> 00:39:21,640
Geez, what are you doing at a sacred place of learning?

575
00:39:21,640 --> 00:39:23,860
Lee Jun Ho.

576
00:39:23,860 --> 00:39:25,470
How have you been?

577
00:39:25,470 --> 00:39:27,820
Wow, what's going on?

578
00:39:27,820 --> 00:39:30,180
I was just thinking about you.

579
00:39:30,180 --> 00:39:32,170
Me? Why?

580
00:39:33,070 --> 00:39:35,180
I was looking at that.

581
00:39:37,160 --> 00:39:39,090
"Hall of Fame."

582
00:39:39,090 --> 00:39:42,520
The glorious title I earned at the age of 20.

583
00:39:43,670 --> 00:39:45,520
Don't forget that I did that.

584
00:39:45,520 --> 00:39:48,200
Nothing gave me more of a thrill in my life than that.

585
00:39:48,200 --> 00:39:51,360
Wow, it's so good to see you.

586
00:39:51,360 --> 00:39:53,680
How long has it been? What's going on?

587
00:39:53,680 --> 00:39:56,350
I'm happy to see you, too. We met on Teacher's Day last year.

588
00:39:56,350 --> 00:39:59,080
I just stopped by since I was around.

589
00:40:00,660 --> 00:40:02,520
Yes, it's so good to see you.

590
00:40:02,520 --> 00:40:04,890
Yes, me, too.

591
00:40:04,890 --> 00:40:07,120
Let's shake hands.

592
00:40:07,120 --> 00:40:09,280
Don't try to hold a man's hand like that.

593
00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:11,660
Stop acting cheeky.

594
00:40:13,180 --> 00:40:15,890
You're way more welcoming than I expected.

595
00:40:15,890 --> 00:40:18,430
You look happier than when I got accepted.

596
00:40:18,430 --> 00:40:21,080
Come on. Not as much as that.

597
00:40:21,080 --> 00:40:23,140
That was...

598
00:40:24,990 --> 00:40:27,550
a highlight of my life.

599
00:40:27,550 --> 00:40:29,060
Wow.

600
00:40:29,680 --> 00:40:31,710
That's an unexpected honor.

601
00:40:31,710 --> 00:40:33,800
Try calling me right now.

602
00:40:33,800 --> 00:40:36,660
- Pardon?
 - Hurry.

603
00:40:45,390 --> 00:40:47,280
Ta-da. 
 My Pride 

604
00:40:47,280 --> 00:40:48,850
Isn't it amazing?

605
00:40:48,850 --> 00:40:50,470
Wow.

606
00:40:53,810 --> 00:40:55,880
That's the kind of person you are.

607
00:41:04,940 --> 00:41:07,150
I feel free somehow.

608
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:11,830
It makes me think I'll live well from now on.

609
00:41:11,830 --> 00:41:15,940
Of course. You're capable of anything.

610
00:41:15,940 --> 00:41:17,560
You're right.

611
00:41:22,900 --> 00:41:25,480
Is the work boring at all?

612
00:41:25,480 --> 00:41:27,660
This is the Republic of Korea.

613
00:41:27,660 --> 00:41:32,160
We had fierce college entrance exams even during the actual war.

614
00:41:32,160 --> 00:41:35,740
Boring? Don't underestimate it.

615
00:41:37,630 --> 00:41:40,010
How satisfied are you with the job, then?

616
00:41:40,910 --> 00:41:43,650
It's absolutely fantastic.

617
00:41:43,650 --> 00:41:44,770
Really?

618
00:41:44,770 --> 00:41:47,890
Yes, really. It's the best.

619
00:41:47,890 --> 00:41:49,970
Can you swear on your conscience?

620
00:41:52,160 --> 00:41:54,130
Give me your employee ID.

621
00:41:55,370 --> 00:41:56,920
Why do you suddenly want that?

622
00:41:56,920 --> 00:41:58,570
Hurry.

623
00:42:03,340 --> 00:42:05,060
Wow.

624
00:42:05,880 --> 00:42:09,650
I heard you guys say this when the new employee training ends.

625
00:42:09,650 --> 00:42:12,270
That blue blood is running through your body.

626
00:42:12,270 --> 00:42:14,200
They still say that?

627
00:42:14,200 --> 00:42:17,300
My salary is probably higher than that of your section chief, who changed his blood color.

628
00:42:17,300 --> 00:42:19,320
At least, the deputy... No.

629
00:42:19,320 --> 00:42:22,210
The team leader is probably beneath me, too.

630
00:42:33,240 --> 00:42:35,230
Get going. It was fun tonight.

631
00:42:35,230 --> 00:42:36,370
Let's see each other often.

632
00:42:36,370 --> 00:42:37,930
Let's.

633
00:43:01,820 --> 00:43:07,820
 Daechi Chase - Enjoy the competition. Triumph. 

634
00:43:21,910 --> 00:43:25,840
 Show me the miracle! 

635
00:43:25,840 --> 00:43:29,030
 Enter the lecturer audition and win the 50 million won prize 

636
00:43:35,240 --> 00:43:38,030
Shouldn't you get a new AC in the master bedroom?

637
00:43:38,030 --> 00:43:39,990
Huh? Why all of a sudden?

638
00:43:40,940 --> 00:43:42,810
Because you suffer every summer.

639
00:43:42,810 --> 00:43:45,390
Or get a new TV in the living room.

640
00:43:45,390 --> 00:43:48,750
Your brother got us a new one two years ago. Don't be wasteful.

641
00:43:48,750 --> 00:43:51,060
How about a dishwasher or a dryer?

642
00:43:51,060 --> 00:43:53,390
The stuff Mom wanted after checking out new apartments.

643
00:43:53,390 --> 00:43:55,760
Is there an event at the employee mall?

644
00:43:56,990 --> 00:44:00,180
- Write down things you want to replace. 
 - Okay.

645
00:44:03,540 --> 00:44:05,690
How's work?

646
00:44:07,330 --> 00:44:09,820
It's as impressive as usual.

647
00:44:10,980 --> 00:44:13,880
Working for the strategy division is nice,

648
00:44:13,880 --> 00:44:16,650
but try applying for a branch abroad.

649
00:44:17,860 --> 00:44:20,570
It's time for a career change.

650
00:44:22,550 --> 00:44:25,510
Career change sounds nice.

651
00:44:25,510 --> 00:44:27,170
Hello?

652
00:44:27,170 --> 00:44:28,740
- Hello?
 - He's in a meeting...

653
00:44:28,740 --> 00:44:31,080
He's in a meeting right now.

654
00:44:31,080 --> 00:44:33,200
Nothing has been determined yet.

655
00:44:33,200 --> 00:44:35,750
- Okay.
 - I have no particular update yet.

656
00:44:35,750 --> 00:44:39,100
The 12th grade? The grades are still...

657
00:44:39,100 --> 00:44:41,360
Hello?

658
00:44:41,360 --> 00:44:45,910
All the Korean teachers are in a meeting right now.

659
00:44:45,910 --> 00:44:47,500
I'm very sorry.

660
00:44:47,500 --> 00:44:51,390
 Principal's Office 

661
00:45:41,300 --> 00:45:46,950
 Mr. Pyo Sang Seob of Chanyeong High 

662
00:45:51,140 --> 00:45:53,160
This is Seo Hye Jin.

663
00:46:48,130 --> 00:46:49,620
Yes.

664
00:46:56,050 --> 00:46:58,590
- Have a seat.
 - Okay.

665
00:46:59,270 --> 00:47:00,680
We'll order a bit later.

666
00:47:00,680 --> 00:47:02,420
Okay.

667
00:47:11,910 --> 00:47:14,830
I started the afternoon schedule, so—

668
00:47:26,430 --> 00:47:31,720
The students must've received the notice by now.

669
00:47:33,440 --> 00:47:35,800
There will be a redo of the exam.

670
00:47:40,500 --> 00:47:44,830
I'm curious about how you feel.

671
00:47:44,830 --> 00:47:47,510
I didn't do it to feel good about myself.

672
00:47:51,040 --> 00:47:53,790
I can hear the results from the students.

673
00:47:53,790 --> 00:47:56,060
Until last year,

674
00:47:56,970 --> 00:48:01,720
I was at a regular high school outside the school district system.

675
00:48:04,050 --> 00:48:08,930
I was appointed to a school in the famous Daechi-dong, and this was my first exam.

676
00:48:10,230 --> 00:48:12,770
I suppose I felt pressured without realizing it

677
00:48:13,790 --> 00:48:17,720
because of the students' enthusiasm for learning and high standards

678
00:48:17,720 --> 00:48:19,670
I'd never experienced before.

679
00:48:21,460 --> 00:48:26,040
I didn't acknowledge the error immediately when the students came to me

680
00:48:26,040 --> 00:48:29,110
probably because I felt inadequate.

681
00:48:29,110 --> 00:48:30,950
You probably can't relate.

682
00:48:31,620 --> 00:48:35,880
- As I said before, I thought it was a good question— 
 - No.

683
00:48:35,880 --> 00:48:39,170
I acknowledge that it was a dated and lazy question.

684
00:48:39,170 --> 00:48:41,360
I apologize.

685
00:48:41,360 --> 00:48:44,000
You shouldn't apologize to me. The students—

686
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:47,790
Since it was my first exam at the new workplace,

687
00:48:47,790 --> 00:48:50,530
I couldn't easily acknowledge the error.

688
00:48:52,090 --> 00:48:56,110
So I insulted you... and

689
00:48:56,800 --> 00:48:59,260
behaved in a way I shouldn't have.

690
00:49:01,230 --> 00:49:02,880
No need to apologize.

691
00:49:02,880 --> 00:49:05,670
-  I just— 
 - Yes.

692
00:49:05,670 --> 00:49:12,530
I know you just needed there to be a redo.

693
00:49:14,140 --> 00:49:20,480
But I can't move on, pretending I didn't do anything wrong.

694
00:49:23,080 --> 00:49:26,010
I acted inappropriately, too—

695
00:49:29,990 --> 00:49:34,140
I was curious about this one thing.

696
00:49:34,140 --> 00:49:39,180
There are many routine ways to complain to school.

697
00:49:39,180 --> 00:49:43,090
I wonder why you chose such an aggressive way.

698
00:49:48,920 --> 00:49:50,480
Well...

699
00:49:51,450 --> 00:49:56,060
I suppose knowing that won't change anything now.

700
00:49:58,970 --> 00:50:04,050
It was actually... a great wake-up call for me.

701
00:50:05,090 --> 00:50:09,620
Students trust academies more than schools.

702
00:50:09,620 --> 00:50:14,470
School is just for receiving grades

703
00:50:14,470 --> 00:50:17,240
and the teacher is for writing transcripts.

704
00:50:19,030 --> 00:50:21,860
I ended up proving that myself.

705
00:50:31,930 --> 00:50:38,250
Knowing and experiencing were two different things.

706
00:50:38,250 --> 00:50:40,920
Why are you telling me all this?

707
00:50:40,920 --> 00:50:43,530
I wanted to let you know, at least.

708
00:50:44,870 --> 00:50:46,700
Oh, I apologize for not addressing you properly.

709
00:50:46,700 --> 00:50:50,590
I can't bring myself to call you "Teacher."

710
00:50:50,590 --> 00:50:53,160
It's okay. What did you want to inform me about—

711
00:50:53,160 --> 00:50:54,800
That...

712
00:50:56,350 --> 00:50:58,360
I am prepared for a long battle.

713
00:50:58,360 --> 00:51:03,950
- Battle?
 - I... chose to become an educator at age 19

714
00:51:03,950 --> 00:51:06,640
and graduated from the College of Education.

715
00:51:08,580 --> 00:51:11,410
In a corner of the old and rotten box,

716
00:51:12,660 --> 00:51:15,590
I still have a silly sense of pride.

717
00:51:20,460 --> 00:51:22,010
That means...

718
00:51:22,700 --> 00:51:27,950
I'm not someone who teaches under a contract.

719
00:51:29,800 --> 00:51:34,680
A person who teaches under a contract has their place and responsibility, too.

720
00:51:39,750 --> 00:51:41,510
I'm glad to hear that.

721
00:51:42,770 --> 00:51:47,550
We understand each other's position well.

722
00:51:50,290 --> 00:51:52,530
I'm sorry, but can we eat next time?

723
00:51:52,530 --> 00:51:54,560
Some schools haven't finished their midterms yet.

724
00:51:54,560 --> 00:51:57,870
- Okay, sounds good.
 - Okay.

725
00:52:39,250 --> 00:52:41,910
Talk to me for a moment.

726
00:52:41,910 --> 00:52:43,890
It's about something good.

727
00:52:44,590 --> 00:52:47,880
Okay, have a seat.

728
00:52:49,290 --> 00:52:52,320
Team Leader Hye Jin, I need a bonus.

729
00:52:52,320 --> 00:52:53,870
Pardon?

730
00:52:55,240 --> 00:52:57,650
We're being flooded with inquiries.

731
00:52:57,650 --> 00:53:01,530
I'm about to lose my mind. I even skipped lunch.

732
00:53:01,530 --> 00:53:03,460
Gosh, I'm sorry.

733
00:53:06,900 --> 00:53:10,280
I know you're tired enough now,

734
00:53:10,280 --> 00:53:15,670
but can we adjust the schedule starting next month?

735
00:53:15,670 --> 00:53:20,740
I'd like to cut down the waitlist a bit.

736
00:53:20,740 --> 00:53:22,590
Other schools besides Chanyeong High, too?

737
00:53:22,590 --> 00:53:25,760
Yes. Daesan Girls' High, too.

738
00:53:28,400 --> 00:53:34,950
I feel terrible considering the lecturers' workload,

739
00:53:34,950 --> 00:53:37,410
but it's the director's idea.

740
00:53:38,640 --> 00:53:43,620
My schedule is pretty full, but I'll try.

741
00:53:46,440 --> 00:53:49,200
You'll wear yourself out.

742
00:53:49,200 --> 00:53:51,150
It's okay.

743
00:53:52,970 --> 00:53:56,270
I made a counseling appointment at four.

744
00:53:56,270 --> 00:54:00,430
Oh, yes. The mothers of Chanyeong High students?

745
00:54:00,430 --> 00:54:02,770
Chief, I'll get going—

746
00:54:02,770 --> 00:54:06,880
This is  that  Ms. Seo Hye Jin.

747
00:54:08,230 --> 00:54:10,060
Hello.

748
00:54:10,060 --> 00:54:12,500
You're way more good-looking in person.

749
00:54:12,500 --> 00:54:14,570
The waitlist wasn't getting any shorter,

750
00:54:14,570 --> 00:54:17,750
so we came to ask you what's going on.

751
00:54:17,750 --> 00:54:20,400
We apologize for the inconvenience.

752
00:54:20,400 --> 00:54:22,870
Let's go to the consultation room over there.

753
00:54:22,870 --> 00:54:27,290
Actually, her schedule is about to be adjusted.

754
00:54:27,290 --> 00:54:30,590
Please come this way. This way.

755
00:54:32,420 --> 00:54:34,530
Yes, please come in here.

756
00:54:34,530 --> 00:54:36,330
Okay.

757
00:54:37,510 --> 00:54:41,470
Who got question No. 14 of the mock test wrong?

758
00:54:44,650 --> 00:54:46,980
Isn't the exam tomorrow?

759
00:54:47,700 --> 00:54:50,610
I didn't expect anyone to get this wrong.

760
00:54:51,560 --> 00:54:55,800
I said there would be a question asking about "Samiingok's" narrator's alter ego.

761
00:54:55,800 --> 00:54:57,980
Don't try to relate to the narrator.

762
00:54:57,980 --> 00:55:01,490
You can't do that, anyway, right? Memorize it.

763
00:55:01,490 --> 00:55:03,530
What did I say studying is for?

764
00:55:04,510 --> 00:55:06,810
It's to solve exam questions.

765
00:55:07,540 --> 00:55:10,530
Okay. We'll quickly go over what will be on the exam.

766
00:55:10,530 --> 00:55:13,700
Follow me. You need to automatically think of these things with rhyme poems.

767
00:55:13,700 --> 00:55:16,270
- How many components? 
 -  Three components. 

768
00:55:16,270 --> 00:55:19,590
Cheer up. Three components. Name them.

769
00:55:19,590 --> 00:55:21,970
- Intro.
 - Intro.

770
00:55:21,970 --> 00:55:24,790
Body.

771
00:55:25,570 --> 00:55:28,660
Conclusion. Okay.

772
00:55:42,340 --> 00:55:44,410
Ms. Seo, are you done?

773
00:55:44,410 --> 00:55:47,640
Why didn't you go home? It's so late.

774
00:55:47,640 --> 00:55:50,800
You must be really out of it.

775
00:55:50,800 --> 00:55:53,130
- Pardon?
 - We have that event tomorrow.

776
00:55:53,130 --> 00:55:55,810
The lecturer recruitment exam.

777
00:55:57,940 --> 00:55:59,920
I need to clean up the lecture room before I go.

778
00:55:59,920 --> 00:56:01,980
Gosh, you're doing so much.

779
00:56:01,980 --> 00:56:04,090
Not as much as you.

780
00:56:04,090 --> 00:56:05,900
See you then.

781
00:56:15,040 --> 00:56:16,980
 Show me the miracle! 

782
00:56:18,800 --> 00:56:23,970
 Daechi Chase - Enjoy the competition 

783
00:56:35,330 --> 00:56:40,370
 Daechi Chase – Enjoy the competition 

784
00:56:47,530 --> 00:56:53,470
 Show me the miracle! Enter the lecturer audition and win the 50 million won prize. 

785
00:56:53,470 --> 00:56:56,350
Yes, you've been confirmed.

786
00:56:56,350 --> 00:56:58,770
- What's your name?
 - Nam Cheong Mi.

787
00:56:58,770 --> 00:57:00,880
Confirmed.

788
00:57:01,500 --> 00:57:04,890
Go to the main lecture room, and they'll take you to the exam room.

789
00:57:04,890 --> 00:57:06,570
Okay.

790
00:57:06,570 --> 00:57:09,650
- What's your name?
 - Kim Seong Hoon.

791
00:57:23,860 --> 00:57:25,480
Excuse me.

792
00:57:26,660 --> 00:57:28,700
What subject are you applying for?

793
00:57:29,650 --> 00:57:31,060
I'm applying for English.

794
00:57:31,060 --> 00:57:34,230
I see. It's Korean for me.

795
00:57:34,990 --> 00:57:38,410
- I see.
 - Is this your first time?

796
00:57:38,410 --> 00:57:42,040
- Pardon?
 - Is this your first time in Daechi-dong?

797
00:57:43,850 --> 00:57:46,480
I do give a lecture once a week.

798
00:57:46,480 --> 00:57:49,110
I've never applied for a full-time position.

799
00:57:49,990 --> 00:57:51,490
This is my second try.

800
00:57:51,490 --> 00:57:53,970
I applied for a different academy but got rejected during the demo lecture.

801
00:57:53,970 --> 00:57:56,360
I work in Jungye now.

802
00:57:56,360 --> 00:57:58,850
Jungye is competitive, too.

803
00:57:58,850 --> 00:58:02,970
But to get noticed by the major academies,

804
00:58:02,970 --> 00:58:05,690
you need to establish yourself in Daechi-dong.

805
00:58:06,670 --> 00:58:09,150
I wish you good luck.

806
00:58:10,330 --> 00:58:12,160
Geez.

807
00:58:12,160 --> 00:58:15,290
I passed the college entrance exam in one go, but not this one.

808
00:58:17,380 --> 00:58:20,080
It's kind of ridiculous.

809
00:58:20,080 --> 00:58:23,240
I'm sure the result will reflect the amount of effort you put in.

810
00:58:23,240 --> 00:58:25,660
They're probably all from SKY*, right?
 (Top three universities in Korea: Seoul National, Korea, and Yonsei)

811
00:58:26,600 --> 00:58:28,330
Pardon?

812
00:58:28,330 --> 00:58:30,480
I mean the schools people went to.

813
00:58:32,810 --> 00:58:35,340
Most of them are.

814
00:58:36,140 --> 00:58:37,950
I'm not, though.

815
00:58:40,310 --> 00:58:42,300
I'm all about my skills.

816
00:58:42,880 --> 00:58:44,750
Fighting.

817
00:58:48,290 --> 00:58:50,310
The exam started.

818
00:58:50,310 --> 00:58:51,700
What do you think?

819
00:58:51,700 --> 00:58:55,010
Do you think the next star the director is looking for is there?

820
00:58:55,010 --> 00:58:57,770
You can't tell by written exams. You need to see the demo lecture.

821
00:58:57,770 --> 00:59:00,670
You never know with the demo lecture.

822
00:59:00,670 --> 00:59:04,960
Even the ones with five or ten years of experience can't shine in the demo.

823
00:59:04,960 --> 00:59:08,770
That's why I drank two bottles of calming supplements before the demo.

01:00:57,250 --> 01:01:00,260
Yes. I'm Lee Jun Ho.

846
01:01:00,260 --> 01:01:02,140
This must be a fate, too.

847
01:01:02,140 --> 01:01:04,880
Why don't we grab some coffee together? A drink works, too.

848
01:01:04,880 --> 01:01:07,040
We can share information about other academies, too.

849
01:01:07,040 --> 01:01:09,270
Isn't this a good opportunity?

850
01:01:09,270 --> 01:01:10,940
Shall we?

851
01:01:13,990 --> 01:01:17,150
Sorry, next time. I forgot I have a plan.

852
01:01:17,150 --> 01:01:18,250
I'm sorry. Good luck.

853
01:01:18,250 --> 01:01:19,780

01:01:30,630 --> 01:01:32,430
I took the exam.

858
01:01:32,430 --> 01:01:33,820
I know. Why?

859
01:01:33,820 --> 01:01:37,050
I'm looking for a job. I changed my career path.

It's suddenly raining.

863
01:01:50,770 --> 01:01:52,610
- Do you have an umbrella?
 - Yes.

864
01:01:52,610 --> 01:01:55,430
- Pajeon?
 - Should we go get pajeon (Korean savory pancakes)?

865
01:01:56,460 --> 01:01:59,490
- I'll ask the other team.
 - Okay.

866
01:02:04,320 --> 01:02:06,840
- What are you thinking about?
 - Team Leader.

867
01:02:06,840 --> 01:02:09,390
Everyone's grabbing food. Join us.

868
01:02:11,070 --> 01:02:13,860
- Team Leader.
 - Yes?

869
01:02:15,070 --> 01:02:16,860
It's nothing.

870
01:02:16,860 --> 01:02:18,230
What? What is it?

871
01:02:18,230 --> 01:02:20,850
It's nothing. I'll take a rain check.

872
01:02:20,850 --> 01:02:22,770
You go ahead.

873
01:02:23,390 --> 01:02:24,720
Okay.

The rain is so refreshing, Team Leader.

881
01:03:12,770 --> 01:03:14,850
I'm sorry. Please give us a moment.

882
01:03:14,850 --> 01:03:16,200
Okay.

883
01:03:20,140 --> 01:03:22,830
Did you wait long? You had no trouble finding this place?

884
01:03:22,830 --> 01:03:25,840
I didn't wait long, and it wasn't that hard to find.

885
01:03:25,840 --> 01:03:28,230
Looks like you got rained on a bit.

886
01:03:28,230 --> 01:03:29,730
A little.

887
01:03:29,730 --> 01:03:31,920
Did you try this yet?

888
01:03:31,920 --> 01:03:34,130
You can just cut to the chase.

889
01:03:37,540 --> 01:03:41,120
You have a talent for surprising people.

890
01:03:41,120 --> 01:03:44,630
I actually was the highlight of someone's life.

891
01:03:44,630 --> 01:03:47,420
- Stop joking around.
 - I'm not.

892
01:03:47,420 --> 01:03:50,830
Did you teach me to be a fool who jokes around with his life?

893
01:03:52,030 --> 01:03:54,170
So, you're serious?

894
01:03:54,770 --> 01:03:57,100
Gosh, how many times do I have to say it to convince you?

895
01:03:57,100 --> 01:04:00,960
I made up my mind a few weeks ago and worked hard to prepare for the exam.

896
01:04:00,960 --> 01:04:02,880
I think I'll get a perfect score, too.

897
01:04:08,140 --> 01:04:12,560
- Did you submit the letter of resign— 
 - I did. It's being processed now.

898
01:04:19,540 --> 01:04:21,940
Did you find the work stressful?

899
01:04:21,940 --> 01:04:24,190
- Not so much.
 - Be honest with me.

900
01:04:24,190 --> 01:04:26,740
You can tell your teacher everything.

901
01:04:26,740 --> 01:04:29,260
Okay, be honest?

902
01:04:29,260 --> 01:04:32,360
I'll be honest since this isn't an interview.

903
01:04:33,000 --> 01:04:38,650
I need to make dozens of times more than my current pay in the next ten years.

904
01:04:39,980 --> 01:04:42,470
- Do you— 
 - I have none. That's it.

905
01:04:43,590 --> 01:04:46,610
Money? It's about money?

906
01:04:46,610 --> 01:04:48,660
Do I need another reason?

907
01:04:50,150 --> 01:04:52,320
Are you a fool?

908
01:04:52,320 --> 01:04:55,200
Where do you live? Don't you know what living in Gangnam means?

909
01:04:55,200 --> 01:04:58,970
You definitely know how to hit the bullseye.

910
01:04:59,570 --> 01:05:02,700
It's not mine. It's my parents'.

911
01:05:26,430 --> 01:05:28,210
Hey.

912
01:05:30,410 --> 01:05:32,540
Ms. Oh Jeong Hwa.

913
01:05:34,230 --> 01:05:38,270
Go sleep inside comfortably. Why are you sleeping there?

914
01:05:44,260 --> 01:05:46,950
Well, I was waiting for Jun Ho.

915
01:05:46,950 --> 01:05:48,750
Isn't he home yet?

916
01:05:48,750 --> 01:05:53,890
It's not good for an employee to go home on time every day.

917
01:05:53,890 --> 01:05:58,560
I heard work dinners aren't so common these days.

918
01:06:00,100 --> 01:06:03,800
You learn about the working world through the news. Seriously.

919
01:06:05,550 --> 01:06:08,530
Did you wake up to pick a fight?

920
01:06:09,410 --> 01:06:11,450
Gosh.

921
01:06:19,550 --> 01:06:25,240
My father used up all his luck with the apartment he had secured in Daechi-dong during the IMF crisis.

922
01:06:25,240 --> 01:06:27,700
He spent all the money he earned for us, the three brothers' education.

923
01:06:27,700 --> 01:06:32,400
We don't have much to inherit, and we never expected to.

924
01:06:32,400 --> 01:06:35,440
Listen to me. You went to a great university.

925
01:06:35,440 --> 01:06:38,330
And you work for a company people would die to work for.

926
01:06:38,330 --> 01:06:41,880
Yes, let's say your parents' assets aren't entirely yours.

927
01:06:41,880 --> 01:06:46,160
But you're not desperate enough to do something so ridiculous.

928
01:06:46,160 --> 01:06:48,780
I don't want to waste the know-how I used to enter a top university,

929
01:06:48,780 --> 01:06:53,040
and I think the company that people love doesn't acknowledge 100% of my ability.

930
01:06:53,040 --> 01:06:56,320
And most importantly, it's about my parents' economic power.

931
01:06:56,320 --> 01:06:58,160
The fact that it's not mine is the point.

932
01:06:58,160 --> 01:06:59,540
People would call you crazy.

933
01:06:59,540 --> 01:07:03,160
I'm saying I can't earn at the same rate as those people.

934
01:07:03,160 --> 01:07:04,270
There are other options.

935
01:07:04,270 --> 01:07:06,960
Study a bit more and get a specialized job or—

936
01:07:06,960 --> 01:07:09,630
I did choose a specialized job.

937
01:07:09,630 --> 01:07:11,860
You know what people say about the star lecturers on the internet?

938
01:07:11,860 --> 01:07:13,320
It's all a lie. It's bullshit.

939
01:07:13,320 --> 01:07:17,350
Only a handful? No, only a tiny fraction of them are like that.

940
01:07:17,350 --> 01:07:19,290
I'm confident.

941
01:07:19,290 --> 01:07:21,360
I was in Grade 8 on my first 10th-grade mock test

942
01:07:21,360 --> 01:07:24,120
Remember how long it took me to become first place.

943
01:07:24,120 --> 01:07:27,000
Who could be better than me at this job?

944
01:07:27,000 --> 01:07:30,130
Studying and teaching are totally different things.

945
01:07:30,130 --> 01:07:32,540
You think I don't know that?

946
01:07:32,540 --> 01:07:36,110
You don't have to worry about that for me.

947
01:07:36,110 --> 01:07:39,670
At least you trained me to study beforehand.

948
01:07:43,720 --> 01:07:48,140
Ms. Seo, I'll create another highlight in your life for you.

949
01:07:48,140 --> 01:07:50,580
Stop mentioning "highlight" already.

950
01:07:50,580 --> 01:07:53,080
- Why?
 - Were you...

951
01:07:53,080 --> 01:07:54,920
by chance...

952
01:07:55,540 --> 01:07:57,830
- Influenced by you somehow?
 - Yes.

953
01:07:57,830 --> 01:08:00,220
Enormously, tremendously, and immensely.

954
01:08:00,220 --> 01:08:01,890
Wow.

955
01:08:02,840 --> 01:08:05,610
Anyway, there are tons of academies in Daechi-dong.

956
01:08:05,610 --> 01:08:08,630
Don't think cutting me off would do anything.

957
01:08:08,630 --> 01:08:10,790
I want you to think carefully.

958
01:08:10,790 --> 01:08:11,990
I've thought enough.

959
01:08:11,990 --> 01:08:14,010
With this job, you don't get evenings or weekends off.

960
01:08:14,010 --> 01:08:15,300
You can't even attend any social events, either.

961
01:08:15,300 --> 01:08:16,670
I don't need evenings or weekends.

962
01:08:16,670 --> 01:08:18,580
And money gifts are best for social events.

963
01:08:18,580 --> 01:08:21,010
You don't get to date anyone, either.

964
01:08:22,160 --> 01:08:26,200
That's one thing... I can manage myself.

965
01:08:52,180 --> 01:08:55,460
Did you write the questions yourself? They were pretty hard.

966
01:08:57,930 --> 01:09:00,700
Did you tell your parents?

967
01:09:00,700 --> 01:09:02,120
I should soon.

968
01:09:02,120 --> 01:09:03,490
What do you think they'll say?

969
01:09:03,490 --> 01:09:05,780
I said I don't care what others say.

970
01:09:05,780 --> 01:09:07,270
You think you can convince them?

971
01:09:07,270 --> 01:09:09,330
- Easily.
 - How?

972
01:09:09,330 --> 01:09:11,440
I took the exam today.

973
01:09:11,440 --> 01:09:15,050
The difficulty level was medium-low. I didn't get any questions wrong.

974
01:09:19,520 --> 01:09:20,650
Teacher.

975
01:09:20,650 --> 01:09:22,600
What?

976
01:09:22,600 --> 01:09:24,640
Try calling me that.

977
01:09:25,620 --> 01:09:26,970
What?

978
01:09:26,970 --> 01:09:29,650
Try calling me "Teacher."

979
01:09:31,640 --> 01:09:33,950
I think that'd make me so happy.

 The Midnight Romance in Hagwon 

983
01:10:08,270 --> 01:10:10,930
 This can't be the gold mine you were talking about, right? 

984
01:10:10,930 --> 01:10:12,270
 I want you to reject him. 

985
01:10:12,270 --> 01:10:15,440
 I can't just let my old student act childishly. 

986
01:10:15,440 --> 01:10:17,330
 - I resigned. 
 - You didn't even work there that long. 

987
01:10:17,330 --> 01:10:19,190
 How dare you say something so low class? 

988
01:10:19,190 --> 01:10:22,580
 I need job experience so I can get high pay. 

989
01:10:22,580 --> 01:10:24,900
 What? Jun Ho's here? 

990
01:10:24,900 --> 01:10:27,120
 - Hey, Lee Jun Ho.
 - You, get out. 

991
01:10:27,120 --> 01:10:30,260
 It's a lie. There are tons of people like me in Daechi-dong. 

992
01:10:30,260 --> 01:10:31,730
 Ms. Seo! 

993
01:10:31,730 --> 01:10:33,340
 So  embarrassing. 

994
01:10:33,340 --> 01:10:37,200
 Why are you trying to act like his mentor? 

995
01:10:37,200 --> 01:10:39,480
 Aren't you crossing the line?
