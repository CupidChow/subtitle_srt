I think I'll mess up this exam.

10

You talk like you never messed up.

11
00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:03,160
Where's your conscience?

12
00:01:03,759 --> 00:01:05,100
Hey, Si Woo.

13
00:01:06,670 --> 00:01:07,770
Can I have a word?

14
00:01:09,369 --> 00:01:11,369
(1 person per desk, please.)

15
00:01:12,369 --> 00:01:13,770
My class starts soon.

16
00:01:13,839 --> 00:01:16,380
I know that. It won't take long.

17
00:01:18,410 --> 00:01:20,279
- It wasn't that bad. - What?

18
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:22,148
- Are you serious? - Yes.

19
00:01:22,149 --> 00:01:23,250
Hello.

20
00:01:23,679 --> 00:01:25,819
- Did you know that one? - We need to cancel exams.

21
00:01:26,250 --> 00:01:28,058
Save me a seat. My usual spot.

22
00:01:28,059 --> 00:01:29,059
Okay.

23
00:01:32,990 --> 00:01:34,030
Sit over there.

24
00:01:39,770 --> 00:01:41,039
Okay...

25
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:46,770
Your class starts soon, so I'll keep the point simple.

26
00:01:49,339 --> 00:01:50,410
Did you see this?

27
00:01:52,149 --> 00:01:54,318
Yes. I think everyone did.

28
00:01:54,319 --> 00:01:56,449
Okay. Will you check it out?

29
00:01:56,750 --> 00:01:58,449
This free lecture.

30
00:01:59,289 --> 00:02:01,860
I wasn't thinking of going.

31
00:02:02,589 --> 00:02:03,619
Okay.

32
00:02:04,660 --> 00:02:05,929
But then,

33
00:02:06,959 --> 00:02:09,600
only kids with poor grades blame their academy...

34
00:02:09,929 --> 00:02:11,800
and check out other places.

35
00:02:14,900 --> 00:02:17,669
That's not exactly the reason.

36
00:02:18,470 --> 00:02:21,139
I study certain subjects for a certain time.

37
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:23,780
Okay. I get it.

38
00:02:25,609 --> 00:02:28,319
That's important too. But...

39
00:02:29,780 --> 00:02:30,880
This lecture.

40
00:02:35,419 --> 00:02:36,819
How about you check it out?

41
00:02:37,690 --> 00:02:40,530
And then tell me how it was.

42
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:41,960
And bring the material.

43
00:02:47,739 --> 00:02:48,799
Why?

44
00:02:50,199 --> 00:02:51,210
I'm curious.

45
00:02:54,069 --> 00:02:56,810
Some other kids will go anyway.

46
00:02:57,139 --> 00:02:58,310
They talked about it at school.

47
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:02,048
You're the most focused in the class.

48
00:03:02,049 --> 00:03:03,280
And take good notes.

49
00:03:07,319 --> 00:03:08,660
Does the director know?

50
00:03:10,889 --> 00:03:13,560
No. I want to know about the lecture.

51
00:03:18,669 --> 00:03:20,329
You're on our scholarship.

52
00:03:21,870 --> 00:03:23,199
Are your parents pleased?

53
00:03:25,210 --> 00:03:26,669
I'm grateful...

54
00:03:27,880 --> 00:03:28,940
for that.

55
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:33,310
Do me a favour.

56
00:03:35,019 --> 00:03:36,019
Will you?

57
00:03:39,489 --> 00:03:41,090
Take good notes too.

58
00:03:43,060 --> 00:03:44,289
It's time to go.

60
00:03:59,970 --> 00:04:02,210
- I'll go ahead. - Okay, see you.

61

Ms. Seo.

62
00:04:10,350 --> 00:04:12,150
Buy me a drink after work.

63
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:15,560
Can't we talk during the daytime tomorrow?

64
00:04:16,190 --> 00:04:19,030
Can't you spare me some time as well?

65
00:04:20,429 --> 00:04:21,530
I'm on your team too.

66
00:04:22,330 --> 00:04:23,330
Okay.

67
00:04:23,729 --> 00:04:25,429
Can I decide where?

68
00:04:26,030 --> 00:04:27,100
Sure.

69
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:29,498
I'll text you the address. Be there around 10:30pm.

70
00:04:29,499 --> 00:04:31,570
- That place is open late. - Okay.

71
00:04:34,369 --> 00:04:36,379
Mr. Lee, you can leave early today.

72
00:04:52,660 --> 00:04:55,260
Hey. Ms. Nam.

73
00:05:03,700 --> 00:05:06,410
One short-answer question with a high mark...

74
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:08,809
will decide what grade you get.

75
00:05:09,710 --> 00:05:11,479
Your school grade could become...

76
00:05:11,749 --> 00:05:15,249
the class you receive when you enter society.

77
00:05:16,280 --> 00:05:17,789
The university you go to.

78
00:05:18,590 --> 00:05:20,220
The job you get afterward.

79
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:24,489
Even the looks of the woman you'll meet on a blind date.

80
00:05:24,629 --> 00:05:26,759
That could all depend on...

81
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:28,900
one short-answer question in this exam.

82
00:05:31,129 --> 00:05:32,999
Don't think that's unfair.

83
00:05:33,770 --> 00:05:38,070
It's better for your mental health to be relieved there's still...

84
00:05:38,239 --> 00:05:41,039
a way to overturn that class.

(Eunma Apartments Shared Parking)

86
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:50,220
Hey, why are we eating at a convenience store like teens?

87
00:05:58,660 --> 00:05:59,830
No, you drink.

88
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:02,059
Don't you start in the afternoon?

89
00:06:02,729 --> 00:06:04,030
You can drink.

90
00:06:04,299 --> 00:06:05,969
I have an important lecture this weekend.

91
00:06:05,970 --> 00:06:07,200
I have a lot to study.

92
00:06:09,100 --> 00:06:11,840
You're acting like you're a star already.

93
00:06:13,109 --> 00:06:14,140
Are you pleased...

94
00:06:14,239 --> 00:06:16,639
your face is plastered all along the street?

95
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:18,350
I'm not kidding.

96
00:06:19,179 --> 00:06:21,520
I need to make this count if I'm to start off big.

97
00:06:24,419 --> 00:06:25,489
Is the work doable?

98
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:28,760
It's crazy fun.

99
00:06:29,820 --> 00:06:30,890
It suits me.

100
00:06:31,229 --> 00:06:32,689
Why do you look dreadful, then?

101
00:06:33,859 --> 00:06:35,859
- It shows? - Yes.

102
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:39,669
Something's getting to me.

103
00:06:39,770 --> 00:06:42,470
Is this what it is to be famous?

104
00:06:43,369 --> 00:06:45,070
Don't be stupid.

105
00:06:46,710 --> 00:06:48,979
What are you on about?

106
00:07:15,340 --> 00:07:16,600
Welcome.

107
00:07:19,739 --> 00:07:22,080
The kids asked a lot of questions today.

108
00:07:22,309 --> 00:07:23,640
You could've ordered something.

109
00:07:28,450 --> 00:07:30,449
Welcome, Ms. Seo.

110
00:07:30,450 --> 00:07:31,489
Hello.

111
00:07:48,939 --> 00:07:51,070
I should've arranged something like this first.

112
00:07:52,140 --> 00:07:53,169
Why?

113
00:07:53,609 --> 00:07:55,080
You could've been upset.

114
00:07:55,939 --> 00:07:56,979
About what?

115
00:07:59,249 --> 00:08:02,049
I planned a joint lecture with Mr. Lee without telling you,

116
00:08:02,379 --> 00:08:05,150
and then put just him in the advertisement next to me.

117
00:08:05,919 --> 00:08:06,989
All that.

118
00:08:07,590 --> 00:08:10,320
Yes. I was so upset I could've cried.

119
00:08:11,830 --> 00:08:12,890
I apologize.

120
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:16,058
If I get to start a class for Heewon High kids, you too can...

121
00:08:16,059 --> 00:08:17,229
You don't have to apologize.

122
00:08:19,070 --> 00:08:20,629
I learned a lot this time.

123
00:08:23,239 --> 00:08:24,270
I have...

124
00:08:28,580 --> 00:08:30,910
I have a habit of thinking of others.

125
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:33,150
When that's not for me to do.

126
00:08:35,450 --> 00:08:37,479
It's definitely not what I wanted.

127
00:08:38,249 --> 00:08:39,719
I want to think...

128
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:42,259
only of myself and how to fill my classroom.

129
00:08:43,460 --> 00:08:46,189
But before I realize, I'm caring about...

130
00:08:46,190 --> 00:08:47,859
others' feelings and situations.

131
00:08:49,460 --> 00:08:52,899
I was betrayed quite a few times at the previous academy.

132
00:08:54,430 --> 00:08:55,470
Ms. Nam.

133
00:08:55,970 --> 00:08:58,710
I felt sorry for an instructor who had just gotten started,

134
00:08:58,970 --> 00:09:00,409
and let her use my materials.

135
00:09:01,509 --> 00:09:02,809
Would you believe it?

136
00:09:02,810 --> 00:09:04,908
She used that to bargain for a higher salary...

137
00:09:04,909 --> 00:09:06,850
and switched academies.

138
00:09:07,550 --> 00:09:10,180
She put her name on the cover and stole my students too.

139
00:09:11,249 --> 00:09:12,320
Isn't that unbelievable?

140
00:09:12,820 --> 00:09:14,960
What exactly are you getting at?

141
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:19,960
If I'd known you were planning something incredible with Mr. Lee,

142
00:09:20,930 --> 00:09:23,399
I should've changed my mind and done what I wanted.

143
00:09:24,659 --> 00:09:25,799
That's what I'm saying.

144
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:26,800
What's that?

145
00:09:27,070 --> 00:09:29,899
I'd wanted to open a class for Chanyoung High students.

146
00:09:32,609 --> 00:09:34,439
That's the school I'm targeting.

147
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:36,278
Yes. I know.

148
00:09:36,279 --> 00:09:37,340
But what?

149
00:09:45,550 --> 00:09:46,550
Pyo Sang Seob.

150
00:09:46,551 --> 00:09:47,988
(Written Exam, 2nd Semester of 2023, 10th Grade Korean)

151
00:09:47,989 --> 00:09:49,789
He taught at Guksabong High for four years...

152
00:09:49,790 --> 00:09:51,389
before transferring to Chanyoung High.

153
00:09:52,489 --> 00:09:55,330
For three years, I taught the kid who did the best in their year.

154
00:09:57,899 --> 00:10:00,600
I found out a few days ago that Mr. Pyo had transferred.

155
00:10:02,499 --> 00:10:04,600
I really wanted to teach Chanyoung High students.

156
00:10:06,340 --> 00:10:07,369
But I held back.

157
00:10:08,180 --> 00:10:11,279
It is very important to know the schoolteachers' style.

158
00:10:11,409 --> 00:10:14,248
But knowing that won't guarantee a successful class...

159
00:10:14,249 --> 00:10:15,249
Ms. Seo.

160
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:17,979
This is my first time in Daechi-dong.

161
00:10:18,950 --> 00:10:20,689
All the schools here are unfamiliar,

162
00:10:20,690 --> 00:10:21,960
and I don't know anyone.

163
00:10:23,290 --> 00:10:26,560
This was such a precious lifeline.

164
00:10:30,499 --> 00:10:32,129
But I just gave up.

165
00:10:33,300 --> 00:10:34,330
Because it was your school.

166
00:10:35,670 --> 00:10:39,238
This supposedly amazing director from Choisun...

167
00:10:39,239 --> 00:10:41,170
or something is after you too, I heard.

168
00:10:42,210 --> 00:10:44,879
Let's not complicate things and add to her troubles.

169
00:10:45,210 --> 00:10:47,509
That was my logic.

170
00:10:51,420 --> 00:10:53,149
Goodness.

171
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:55,659
Isn't that pathetic?

172
00:10:56,659 --> 00:10:57,889
I know how you feel.

173
00:10:59,830 --> 00:11:01,090
I doubt that.

174
00:11:01,759 --> 00:11:04,229
You teach hundreds of kids here.

175
00:11:07,070 --> 00:11:08,639
Why did you ask to see me today?

176
00:11:10,470 --> 00:11:11,970
The final exam special lecture.

177
00:11:12,739 --> 00:11:14,440
I'll teach Chanyoung High students too.

178
00:11:26,350 --> 00:11:27,950
I'm in the area, Ms. Seo.

179
00:11:28,259 --> 00:11:29,619
Text me when you're done.

180
00:11:30,159 --> 00:11:31,729
Don't drink too much.

181
00:11:32,460 --> 00:11:33,689
The lecture's around the corner.

182
00:11:33,690 --> 00:11:35,129
Lee Jun Ho. Whatever others say...

183
00:11:37,460 --> 00:11:39,229
You did the right thing.

184
00:11:39,970 --> 00:11:43,340
My gosh. You sly thing.

185
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:46,639
To me, you said he'd lost his mind.

186
00:11:47,310 --> 00:11:50,180
I did some thinking after that.

187
00:11:51,239 --> 00:11:52,950
Jun Ho has the brightest future.

188
00:11:55,050 --> 00:11:56,979
After me comes you.

189
00:11:57,450 --> 00:12:00,420
You see the future clearly.

190
00:12:00,550 --> 00:12:03,189
I'm a journalist that everyone looks down on,

191
00:12:03,190 --> 00:12:05,629
and he's a grad student that everyone considers a slave.

192
00:12:06,159 --> 00:12:08,960
Compared to him, you're closer to success.

193
00:12:10,229 --> 00:12:12,028
You're a teacher at least.

194
00:12:12,029 --> 00:12:15,699
Hey. Not long from now, I'll be a professor.

195
00:12:15,700 --> 00:12:18,268
- Jun Ho's still ahead. - How so?

196
00:12:18,269 --> 00:12:20,310
By the time you become a tenured professor,

197
00:12:20,609 --> 00:12:23,109
he might have retired with a building to his name.

198
00:12:25,050 --> 00:12:27,878
Of course, that's only if things go really well.

199
00:12:27,879 --> 00:12:30,648
The worst outcome is that I'll retire as a landlord.

200
00:12:30,649 --> 00:12:33,319
If things go well, you must invest in my academy.

201
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:34,320
Darn it.

202
00:12:38,529 --> 00:12:39,529
I'm at the academy.

203
00:12:40,989 --> 00:12:42,858
You can finish up. I'm leaving.

204
00:12:42,859 --> 00:12:45,728
- Just like that? - I'll be in touch.

205
00:12:45,729 --> 00:12:48,699
I'll be too busy to see you for a while. Bye.

206
00:12:48,700 --> 00:12:50,268
Hey, Lee Jun Ho!

207
00:12:50,269 --> 00:12:51,609
Forget about him.

208
00:12:52,769 --> 00:12:54,909
Let's go indoors. It's getting cold.

209
00:13:02,279 --> 00:13:03,749
(Daechi Chase)

210
00:13:15,859 --> 00:13:17,228
Why didn't you go home?

211
00:13:17,229 --> 00:13:19,028
I let you leave early...

212
00:13:19,029 --> 00:13:20,430
because you stayed late last night.

213
00:13:22,399 --> 00:13:24,868
I didn't feel like working, so I was going to leave early too,

214
00:13:24,869 --> 00:13:26,509
but your text changed my mind.

215
00:13:28,239 --> 00:13:29,340
Let's go to a classroom.

216
00:13:29,540 --> 00:13:31,679
The whole world knows what we're up to now.

217
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:33,710
We can prepare in the open.

218
00:13:37,080 --> 00:13:38,790
- Is something wrong? - What do you mean?

219
00:13:40,190 --> 00:13:42,259
Is Ms. Nam very angry?

220
00:13:42,690 --> 00:13:43,720
Oh, her?

221
00:13:44,989 --> 00:13:48,300
She's going to teach a special class for Chanyoung High kids.

222
00:13:49,060 --> 00:13:50,060
What?

223
00:13:50,899 --> 00:13:53,569
I wonder if I focused too much on Heewon High.

224
00:13:53,570 --> 00:13:55,199
I should review my Chanyoung material too.

225
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:57,470
Why would she do that?

226
00:13:58,710 --> 00:14:00,669
I'll have a word with her.

227
00:14:00,670 --> 00:14:01,738
What for?

228
00:14:01,739 --> 00:14:03,339
To ask if she planned on assassinating you...

229
00:14:03,340 --> 00:14:04,579
at this important time.

230
00:14:04,580 --> 00:14:05,879
That's not right.

231
00:14:06,050 --> 00:14:07,478
How is it not right?

232
00:14:07,479 --> 00:14:09,319
We don't have the right to stop her.

233
00:14:09,320 --> 00:14:10,619
It's up to her.

234
00:14:11,220 --> 00:14:13,090
She should have better morals.

235
00:14:14,889 --> 00:14:17,359
Say that to her face and you'll get shot.

236
00:14:18,159 --> 00:14:19,258
So we do nothing?

237
00:14:19,259 --> 00:14:21,729
Did I say we'll do nothing? Prove that...

238
00:14:22,129 --> 00:14:24,229
your face is next to mine not because you were favoured.

239
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:25,869
Let's go.

240
00:14:30,340 --> 00:14:32,710
(A teacher and student sally forth)

241
00:14:34,070 --> 00:14:35,679
(Daechi Chase's miracle Lee Jun Ho, Main instructor Seo Hye Jin)

242
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:37,238
(The best Korean lectures so far weren't actually the best!)

243
00:14:37,239 --> 00:14:42,420
Bus number 2413 will arrive shortly.

244
00:14:45,850 --> 00:14:47,320
I saw Jun Ho's face...

245
00:14:47,649 --> 00:14:50,190
on a huge poster on every street.

246
00:14:50,889 --> 00:14:52,690
It felt strange.

247
00:14:58,060 --> 00:15:01,499
Do you think he'll be really successful like he said?

248
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:05,639
Even then, he'll only be a successful academy instructor.

249
00:15:06,940 --> 00:15:09,879
It could be different if things work out.

250
00:15:11,479 --> 00:15:15,779
Some of them own property in Gangnam worth hundreds of millions.

251
00:15:18,989 --> 00:15:20,320
Did he find a place?

252
00:15:21,519 --> 00:15:23,119
He hasn't said yet.

253
00:15:25,159 --> 00:15:26,229
Oh, gosh.

254
00:15:27,129 --> 00:15:30,100
Did you have to upset him like that?

255
00:15:32,229 --> 00:15:34,600
He comes home late every night.

256
00:15:35,239 --> 00:15:37,139
You could've let him stay with us.

257
00:15:38,070 --> 00:15:41,779
Then at least I could feed him properly.

258
00:15:43,340 --> 00:15:45,279
He needs to know how ruthless it is out there.

259
00:15:46,710 --> 00:15:48,648
He thinks we're lucky...

260
00:15:48,649 --> 00:15:50,649
that we have what we've built up.

261
00:15:52,649 --> 00:15:54,719
Do you have to be so twisted?

262
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:55,859
He's our son.

263
00:15:56,420 --> 00:15:58,290
He has the wrong mindset.

264
00:15:59,889 --> 00:16:00,960
Darn it.

265
00:16:10,999 --> 00:16:14,269
This piece can appear on exams in many shapes and forms.

266
00:16:14,540 --> 00:16:16,878
Memorize the content, structure, symbolism,

267
00:16:16,879 --> 00:16:18,749
meanings, and definitions.

268
00:16:19,350 --> 00:16:21,920
It's almost like a transformer.

269
00:16:22,879 --> 00:16:25,290
Mention it's easy to get wrong when coupled with a similar novel.

270
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:27,790
- Drop the transformer comment. - Okay.

271
00:16:29,060 --> 00:16:30,489
How about switching the topic?

272
00:16:32,460 --> 00:16:33,690
The passage is too long.

273
00:16:34,389 --> 00:16:35,629
And the board's too packed.

274
00:16:36,430 --> 00:16:38,529
I don't think it suits a taster lecture.

275
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:41,728
- But... - Heewon's a boys' school.

276
00:16:41,729 --> 00:16:43,868
You must approach it differently...

277
00:16:43,869 --> 00:16:45,100
from a co-ed or girls' school.

278
00:16:45,810 --> 00:16:47,940
Boys tend to neglect to take notes.

279
00:16:48,580 --> 00:16:49,639
It's a good novel.

280
00:16:51,509 --> 00:16:53,180
There's no bad novel in any textbook.

281
00:16:54,350 --> 00:16:56,820
A good novel is different from what's better for sales.

282
00:16:59,220 --> 00:17:01,419
- Sales... - Don't try to be fresh.

283
00:17:01,420 --> 00:17:02,420
Act like you're seasoned.

284
00:17:02,590 --> 00:17:04,789
You must do your best to convince them you can...

285
00:17:04,790 --> 00:17:06,259
improve their grade class.

286
00:17:10,100 --> 00:17:11,300
I'll change what I write on the board.

287
00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:12,629
Keep going.

288
00:17:15,030 --> 00:17:17,340
("Camera and Combat Boots" by Park Wan Suh)

289
00:17:18,669 --> 00:17:19,969
Park Wan Suh is...

290
00:17:20,469 --> 00:17:21,669
Don't talk about the writer.

291
00:17:21,770 --> 00:17:23,139
Focus on improving grades.

292
00:17:23,639 --> 00:17:26,579
Schoolteachers make exam questions based on the textbook.

293
00:17:26,580 --> 00:17:28,149
If you have the time to mention the writer,

294
00:17:28,820 --> 00:17:30,080
explain a new word.

295
00:17:32,919 --> 00:17:34,949
Did you look up Heewon High's exam trend?

296
00:17:36,689 --> 00:17:38,359
- Yes. - Name the characteristics.

297
00:17:39,730 --> 00:17:41,789
Short-answer questions focus on topics or themes,

298
00:17:41,790 --> 00:17:44,600
and the main character's self-reflection.

299
00:17:45,300 --> 00:17:47,169
When a multiple-choice question asks about similar works,

300
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:48,800
it tends to be a trap.

301
00:17:50,439 --> 00:17:53,039
Vocabulary questions always appear in the SAT format.

302
00:17:53,040 --> 00:17:55,709
And? You want to waste time with what?

303
00:18:06,790 --> 00:18:07,850
It feels weird.

304
00:18:09,590 --> 00:18:10,659
What does?

305
00:18:10,919 --> 00:18:13,159
This isn't how you used to teach me.

306
00:18:14,260 --> 00:18:15,299
What do you mean?

307
00:18:15,300 --> 00:18:17,060
You made me like reading,

308
00:18:17,230 --> 00:18:19,730
and helped me enjoy the process of answering questions.

309
00:18:20,469 --> 00:18:22,240
What I'm saying is...

310
00:18:23,969 --> 00:18:26,240
When what I feel is the correct answer,

311
00:18:26,340 --> 00:18:28,579
I feel so good I could fly.

312
00:18:28,580 --> 00:18:30,009
It made me want to know...

313
00:18:30,010 --> 00:18:32,850
what wasn't included in the textbook.

314
00:18:33,149 --> 00:18:35,580
Concentrate. Isn't your goal to teach a large class?

315
00:18:39,419 --> 00:18:41,049
Do we just have to guess what will be in the exam?

316
00:18:41,050 --> 00:18:42,419
What else must we do for them?

317
00:18:43,419 --> 00:18:44,490
Tell me.

318
00:18:48,699 --> 00:18:50,198
We're up against the White Haired Witch.

319
00:18:50,199 --> 00:18:52,069
Our director wanted to run with his tail between his legs...

320
00:18:52,070 --> 00:18:53,399
and we convinced him not to.

321
00:18:53,730 --> 00:18:55,938
I promised the other team leaders I'd secure...

322
00:18:55,939 --> 00:18:57,399
a Heewon High class.

323
00:18:57,969 --> 00:19:00,138
Ms. Nam and the other low-rank teachers...

324
00:19:00,139 --> 00:19:01,439
hate us anyway.

325
00:19:02,740 --> 00:19:04,010
Do as I say and don't complain.

326
00:19:04,639 --> 00:19:05,709
I'm right.

327
00:19:29,070 --> 00:19:30,600
I got what I must do.

328
00:19:32,939 --> 00:19:34,769
Let's practice with a mic from tomorrow.

329
00:19:34,770 --> 00:19:36,139
It affects how you use your hands.

330
00:19:36,540 --> 00:19:37,609
You should get used to it.

331
00:19:39,050 --> 00:19:40,050
Okay.

332
00:19:40,850 --> 00:19:43,080
Go on home. Good job today.

333
00:19:44,719 --> 00:19:45,719
I hope...

334
00:19:47,820 --> 00:19:48,889
you sleep well.

335
00:19:52,389 --> 00:19:53,429
Bye.

336
00:20:54,919 --> 00:20:57,389
Ms. Cha the lawyer. What's up?

337
00:20:57,619 --> 00:20:58,689
Hey.

338
00:20:59,560 --> 00:21:01,530
My darn husband...

339
00:21:01,790 --> 00:21:04,729
accepted two shots from a customer.

340
00:21:04,730 --> 00:21:05,800
I'm driving him home.

341
00:21:06,899 --> 00:21:08,898
I'm a lawyer wife...

342
00:21:08,899 --> 00:21:11,168
and this is how he treats me.

343
00:21:11,169 --> 00:21:13,408
I love you, my dear lawyer wife.

344
00:21:13,409 --> 00:21:15,439
My gosh. Darn you.

345
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:18,139
Hey, nice.

346
00:21:18,639 --> 00:21:20,350
I saw your new poster.

347
00:21:20,909 --> 00:21:22,819
What a sight.

348
00:21:22,820 --> 00:21:24,219
It brightens the whole neighbourhood.

349
00:21:24,949 --> 00:21:26,590
It's him, isn't it?

350
00:21:26,750 --> 00:21:29,619
Yes. We decided to do something big.

351
00:21:29,859 --> 00:21:30,919
What do you think?

352
00:21:32,020 --> 00:21:35,899
Hey, are you free this weekend?

353
00:21:36,399 --> 00:21:37,659
I have an event.

354
00:21:39,199 --> 00:21:40,868
No, we can't celebrate.

355
00:21:40,869 --> 00:21:42,199
Who knows how it'll go?

356
00:21:42,369 --> 00:21:45,439
Why even worry? It'll obviously be a hit.

357
00:21:45,740 --> 00:21:47,310
You're Seo Hye Jin.

358
00:21:47,969 --> 00:21:49,608
I'll lay out a feast...

359
00:21:49,609 --> 00:21:51,980
fit to break the table in two.

360
00:21:52,149 --> 00:21:53,149
Okay?

361
00:21:53,150 --> 00:21:54,909
Okay. Thanks.

362
00:21:55,480 --> 00:21:56,919
Drive safely.

363
00:21:57,879 --> 00:22:01,090
Okay, I will. Bye.

364
00:22:31,250 --> 00:22:33,790
("Camera and Combat Boots")

365
00:23:32,679 --> 00:23:34,209
(Slide to power off)

put these aside before I open the paper?

See you in ten.

382

It's not an exact number,

383
00:25:26,530 --> 00:25:29,629
but about 50 kids will go to Seo Hye Jin's lecture.

384
00:25:31,159 --> 00:25:33,530
The actual number will be bigger.

385

By the way,

389
00:26:10,669 --> 00:26:13,369
the number of kids who applied for the free lecture met the quota?

390
00:26:13,639 --> 00:26:16,310
Yes. It might end up being first come, first served.

391
00:26:19,179 --> 00:26:20,949
Is Jun Ho managing okay?

392
00:26:21,350 --> 00:26:23,879
He had so little time.

393
00:26:25,179 --> 00:26:27,289
It's fortunate it's a joint lecture.

394
00:26:27,290 --> 00:26:29,189

396
00:26:30,889 --> 00:26:31,959
He's a smart kid.

397
00:26:32,590 --> 00:26:34,590
He does pick up things fast.

398

You don't have to worry.

399
00:26:38,830 --> 00:26:40,428
I'm not worried.

400
00:26:40,429 --> 00:26:42,070
I never worried.

401
00:26:43,240 --> 00:26:45,199
- You're sure about that? - Yes.

402
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:47,310
I just have high hopes.

403
00:26:49,010 --> 00:26:51,010

I appreciate your spirit,

410
00:27:12,100 --> 00:27:13,830

411
00:27:14,530 --> 00:27:16,300
That has never happened here.

412
00:27:16,869 --> 00:27:19,540
Why not hear her out first?

413
00:27:21,639 --> 00:27:23,310
Ms. Nam,

414
00:27:23,679 --> 00:27:25,539
you need to be able to prove...

415
00:27:25,540 --> 00:27:27,580
that you have a competitive edge that equals Ms. Seo's.

418
00:27:38,560 --> 00:27:41,560
There's no doubt she'll let Ms. Nam open a class.

419
00:27:43,100 --> 00:27:46,030
Tell me how long it's been since she started searching...

420
00:27:46,530 --> 00:27:48,030
for your rival.

421
00:27:50,740 --> 00:27:53,409
I can shoot down the idea though.

422
00:27:54,570 --> 00:27:56,840
That'd be a cheap shot on my end.

423
00:27:57,340 --> 00:27:58,609
I'll work harder.

424
00:27:59,750 --> 00:28:00,780
Gosh.

425
00:28:01,909 --> 00:28:03,279
You prepare for classes during the day...

426
00:28:03,280 --> 00:28:04,850
and teach students in the evening.

427
00:28:05,320 --> 00:28:07,320
After midnight, you give Jun Ho private lessons.

428
00:28:07,649 --> 00:28:10,560
At this rate, your energy will be depleted for good.

429
00:28:11,820 --> 00:28:13,129
You should watch us prepare for the class.

You've taught this material thousands of times now,

00:29:16,919 --> 00:29:19,730
to prepare for a class you've taught for so long.

449
00:29:20,659 --> 00:29:22,760
Not evolving is the scariest of all.

450

- Sure. - Right.

452
00:29:29,240 --> 00:29:32,639
"Camera and Combat Boots" is a novel set in the 1970s.

453
00:29:32,969 --> 00:29:35,208
It follows the story of the narrator...

454
00:29:35,209 --> 00:29:37,340
who finds himself facing the industrialization period.

455
00:29:37,580 --> 00:29:40,709
That means it's written from a first-person perspective.

456
00:29:41,109 --> 00:29:42,250
The storytelling mode.

457
00:29:42,919 --> 00:29:45,550
The storytelling mode is the first thing to remember...

458
00:29:46,389 --> 00:29:49,020
since that alone can help you answer advanced questions.

459
00:29:49,790 --> 00:29:51,759
Question one in the material you were given...

460
00:29:51,760 --> 00:29:52,929
is one of those examples.

461
00:29:54,159 --> 00:29:55,230
Let's go over it together.

462
00:29:56,129 --> 00:29:57,659
Questions like these?

463
00:29:58,000 --> 00:29:59,600
There's no need to even read the passage.

464
00:30:00,199 --> 00:30:02,169
After going over your choices,

465
00:30:02,399 --> 00:30:03,969
you should answer it correctly in less than a minute.

466
00:30:04,369 --> 00:30:07,609
It's all good, but can you reduce the time?

467
00:30:08,040 --> 00:30:10,679
Cutting time is half the battle with Heewon High School's Korean exam.

468
00:30:10,980 --> 00:30:12,749
You need a way to give them as much time as you can...

469
00:30:12,750 --> 00:30:14,109
to spend on short-answer questions.

470
00:30:14,310 --> 00:30:16,678
But one must understand the modes of storytelling...

471
00:30:16,679 --> 00:30:18,449
to answer a certain multiple choice question.

472
00:30:19,389 --> 00:30:20,419
Right.

473
00:30:20,949 --> 00:30:21,990
Wait.

474
00:30:22,959 --> 00:30:24,990
Here's the passage I chose.

475
00:30:26,659 --> 00:30:28,129
Is this it? Okay.

476
00:30:29,330 --> 00:30:31,059
I like how you added another passage,

477
00:30:31,060 --> 00:30:32,359
but let's change the source.

478
00:30:32,899 --> 00:30:34,330
This one won't be in the exam.

479
00:30:35,070 --> 00:30:36,240
But it's easy to understand.

480
00:30:36,639 --> 00:30:38,500
That can't be our goal when it's a sample lecture.

481
00:30:40,070 --> 00:30:41,939
If you want to choose a foreign novel...

482
00:30:42,939 --> 00:30:45,379
Right. Go with "The Great Gatsby" instead.

483
00:30:45,810 --> 00:30:47,609
We could promote our English classes with it.

484
00:30:48,879 --> 00:30:49,919
I'll get right on it.

485
00:30:51,350 --> 00:30:52,820
You're putting too much stress on your throat.

487
00:30:55,990 --> 00:30:57,159
Yes, I followed some instructions online.

491
00:31:04,600 --> 00:31:06,699
don't be too focused on saving time.

to stop you from getting that perfect score.

494
00:31:14,869 --> 00:31:16,378
Points and scores are important,

495
00:31:16,379 --> 00:31:17,608
but it's more crucial...

496
00:31:17,609 --> 00:31:19,679
to eliminate the risk of losing points. Got it?

497
00:31:20,649 --> 00:31:21,879

To be honest, I am.

545
00:34:14,850 --> 00:34:16,319
A memorable triumph.

546
00:34:19,190 --> 00:34:20,259
Let's create one together.

547
00:34:21,759 --> 00:34:23,000
- Let's go. - Sure.

548
00:34:27,799 --> 00:34:30,540

549
00:34:33,810 --> 00:34:35,838
(Heewon High School Free Lecture)

550
00:34:35,839 --> 00:34:36,909
Let's do this.

551
00:34:45,279 --> 00:34:46,449
Thanks for this.

552
00:34:46,520 --> 00:34:47,549
As if you need to thank me.

553
00:34:48,250 --> 00:34:50,060
I want the lecture to begin at any second.

554
00:34:50,190 --> 00:34:51,420
I can't wait.

555
00:34:52,119 --> 00:34:53,690
You won't be disappointed.

556
00:35:01,770 --> 00:35:04,270
- Hit him. - The one in front of you.

557
00:35:05,040 --> 00:35:06,610
You shouldn't be next to me.

558
00:35:06,810 --> 00:35:08,909
Darn, I died.

559
00:35:09,239 --> 00:35:10,310
You're dead weight.

560
00:35:10,880 --> 00:35:12,710
It's already been an hour, and we need to get to class.

561
00:35:13,850 --> 00:35:16,049
Already? You ruined it all.

562
00:35:16,210 --> 00:35:18,449
It was close though. Come on. Hurry.

563
00:35:23,259 --> 00:35:24,460
You really should listen to me.

564
00:35:31,860 --> 00:35:36,440
(Those who study will never lose.)

00:35:38,199 --> 00:35:40,909
(Study Cafe, Cafe Etiquettes)

566
00:35:50,350 --> 00:35:51,650
Sure. Have a good one.

567
00:35:51,679 --> 00:35:53,589
- Are you off to the Korean class? - Yes.

568
00:36:02,690 --> 00:36:06,029
(Field assistant)

(Daechi Chase)

570
00:36:21,009 --> 00:36:22,049
Ms. Woo.

571
00:36:22,509 --> 00:36:23,650
Shall we?

572
00:36:24,219 --> 00:36:26,790
Sure. We'll go together.

573
00:36:54,080 --> 00:36:55,080
Ms. Seo...

574
00:36:57,319 --> 00:36:58,718
It's before the designated time.

575
00:36:58,719 --> 00:37:00,948
When I was a student, I always arrived right on time...

576
00:37:00,949 --> 00:37:02,350
because I didn't want to study.

577
00:37:03,089 --> 00:37:04,860
It's still odd that no one's here.

578
00:37:07,929 --> 00:37:10,159
Let me check outside.

579
00:37:16,670 --> 00:37:19,100
Are you sure the texts were properly sent out?

580
00:37:19,500 --> 00:37:20,909
Could it have said next week instead?

581
00:37:21,469 --> 00:37:22,770
I checked many times.

582
00:37:24,779 --> 00:37:26,779
Ms. Seo, you're bleeding.

583
00:37:28,949 --> 00:37:30,219
- Get me a tissue. - Just a second.

584
00:37:39,159 --> 00:37:41,830
(A teacher and student sally forth)

585
00:37:54,540 --> 00:37:56,109
Why are we having a makeup class...

586
00:37:56,110 --> 00:37:57,710
when the finals haven't even been announced yet?

587
00:37:58,040 --> 00:37:59,710
- Who knows? - Hey.

588
00:37:59,949 --> 00:38:01,080
I was hoping to catch that instead.

589
00:38:01,150 --> 00:38:02,778
What was it again? The teacher and student thing.

590
00:38:02,779 --> 00:38:03,819
Me too.

591
00:38:05,020 --> 00:38:06,119
Excuse me.

592
00:38:07,049 --> 00:38:10,060
(A teacher and student sally forth)

593
00:38:23,299 --> 00:38:25,069
The attendance rate is 99 percent.

594
00:38:25,699 --> 00:38:27,009
That's the correct mindset.

595
00:38:28,610 --> 00:38:29,839
Seo Hye Jin's lecture...

596
00:38:30,779 --> 00:38:31,810
will be cancelled.

597
00:38:33,409 --> 00:38:34,480
That poor thing.

598
00:38:35,009 --> 00:38:37,049
Her hard work would've been for nothing.

599
00:39:06,710 --> 00:39:07,750
What on earth is going on?

600
00:39:09,279 --> 00:39:10,279
What...

601
00:39:10,880 --> 00:39:12,179
I thought seats had to be filled by order of arrival...

602
00:39:12,449 --> 00:39:14,350
due to there being too many applicants.

603
00:39:15,889 --> 00:39:17,059
I'll look into it.

604
00:39:17,060 --> 00:39:18,819
No, let me do that.

605
00:39:21,889 --> 00:39:23,560
Are you sure the students were properly notified?

606
00:39:31,299 --> 00:39:32,339
Excuse me.

607
00:39:36,940 --> 00:39:37,940
Hello.

608
00:39:38,679 --> 00:39:40,580
You're offering a free lecture today, right?

609
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:01,029
Is this the place?

610
00:40:02,830 --> 00:40:04,069
Yes, it is.

611
00:40:04,500 --> 00:40:05,569
It is, but...

612
00:40:11,409 --> 00:40:12,810
Shouldn't you be in class?

613
00:40:13,880 --> 00:40:15,009
Don't they need an assistant?

614
00:40:15,850 --> 00:40:17,049
It's not that.

615
00:40:18,049 --> 00:40:19,119
What is it, then?

616
00:40:23,619 --> 00:40:25,960
I think the free lecture is a total bust.

617
00:40:34,900 --> 00:40:35,929
- Hey. - Come on.

618
00:40:36,500 --> 00:40:38,069
Did the lecture already begin?

619
00:40:38,440 --> 00:40:40,610
I was about to see how many students showed up.

620
00:40:44,009 --> 00:40:45,210
We have to cancel.

621
00:40:46,580 --> 00:40:47,610
What?

622
00:40:54,420 --> 00:40:56,219
Shouldn't the lecture begin?

623
00:41:02,060 --> 00:41:03,060
Just a second.

624
00:41:08,900 --> 00:41:11,069
Ms. Seo, are you all right?

625
00:41:12,400 --> 00:41:13,770
No, I'm not all right.

626
00:41:14,869 --> 00:41:16,110
You can snap out of it though, right?

627
00:41:19,279 --> 00:41:20,350
Ms. Seo.

628
00:41:23,319 --> 00:41:25,380
Right. Sorry about that.

629
00:41:26,020 --> 00:41:27,089
Well...

630
00:41:28,190 --> 00:41:31,758
First, can you talk to that student...

631
00:41:31,759 --> 00:41:33,659
and apologize? And...

632
00:41:34,759 --> 00:41:36,259
Tell him he can keep the material.

633
00:41:39,060 --> 00:41:40,169
Urge him to study it...

634
00:41:40,170 --> 00:41:41,899
since we worked hard to put that together.

635
00:41:41,900 --> 00:41:44,069
- Also... - Wait.

636
00:41:45,199 --> 00:41:46,400
What are you talking about?

637
00:41:48,139 --> 00:41:49,369
I'm going through with it.

638
00:41:51,310 --> 00:41:53,210
He came here to learn from us.

639
00:41:53,480 --> 00:41:54,509
This...

640
00:41:55,480 --> 00:41:58,048
I'm also stunned right now, but I think we need to do this.

641
00:41:58,049 --> 00:42:00,020
Actually, we have to.

642
00:42:13,529 --> 00:42:15,029
(Director's Office)

643
00:42:16,569 --> 00:42:17,699
I found out why.

644
00:42:18,569 --> 00:42:19,639
A special lecture?

645
00:42:20,369 --> 00:42:21,369
Yes.

646
00:42:21,940 --> 00:42:24,079
Only those who are present at Choisun Academy...

647
00:42:24,080 --> 00:42:26,309
will be given a new textbook and study material.

648
00:42:26,310 --> 00:42:28,080
An urgent notice was sent out.

649
00:42:33,080 --> 00:42:34,150
Gosh.

650
00:42:34,889 --> 00:42:36,690
Hwang Sang who wrote "Imsul Diary"...

651
00:42:36,889 --> 00:42:39,219
and Jung "Dasan" Yak Yong...

652
00:42:39,719 --> 00:42:41,229
are famously known for their close relationship...

653
00:42:41,230 --> 00:42:42,730
as mentor and mentee.

654
00:42:43,290 --> 00:42:45,399
However, due to his status as a middle-class man,

655
00:42:45,400 --> 00:42:47,069
Hwang Sang couldn't seek government posts.

656
00:42:47,469 --> 00:42:49,068
That is why he spent his life...

657
00:42:49,069 --> 00:42:50,699
residing in the countryside writing poems.

658
00:42:51,339 --> 00:42:52,638
Jung Yak Yong...

659
00:42:52,639 --> 00:42:55,469
also wasted 18 years of his life in exile.

660
00:42:56,710 --> 00:43:00,480
The adoration and mentorship of these two men...

661
00:43:00,949 --> 00:43:03,549
might seem like self-complacence...

662
00:43:04,179 --> 00:43:05,619
in modern-day terms.

663
00:43:06,850 --> 00:43:10,360
However, it's a passage loved by school teachers.

664
00:43:11,219 --> 00:43:13,489
Take a look at the material that was handed out.

665
00:43:16,259 --> 00:43:17,560
Why did it have to be "Imsul Diary?"

666
00:43:18,199 --> 00:43:20,569
No wonder your Korean grade is always at level five.

667
00:43:20,929 --> 00:43:22,900
- That's why I asked you. - It's an essay in Chinese.

668
00:43:23,639 --> 00:43:24,899
A magnetic teacher-student relationship...

669
00:43:24,900 --> 00:43:26,198
- is a so-called spiritual victory. - Through that,

670
00:43:26,199 --> 00:43:28,639
their interaction is put on display.

671
00:43:29,009 --> 00:43:30,310
She's publicly calling them out.

672
00:43:46,460 --> 00:43:47,759
It's been a while,

673
00:43:49,230 --> 00:43:50,560
so how about we go for drinks?

674
00:43:52,730 --> 00:43:55,299
Seeing them will only make you all uncomfortable.

675
00:43:59,339 --> 00:44:00,369
Gosh.

676
00:44:10,750 --> 00:44:13,449
Head home when you're done, then.

677
00:44:15,420 --> 00:44:16,790
It's the right thing to do.

678
00:44:17,360 --> 00:44:18,419
They'll be embarrassed...

679
00:44:18,420 --> 00:44:19,690
if we go to them after the lecture is over.

680
00:44:20,830 --> 00:44:23,999
I seriously don't know what to say to them.

681
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:25,060
How about we make a run for it?

682
00:44:33,610 --> 00:44:34,610
Come on.

683
00:44:39,380 --> 00:44:40,650
Will an hour be enough?

684
00:44:43,009 --> 00:44:45,679
- For what? - While I teach the first half,

685
00:44:46,380 --> 00:44:47,549
get your act together.

686
00:44:48,089 --> 00:44:49,889
You need to do your share.

687
00:44:51,889 --> 00:44:52,920
All right?

688
00:44:59,060 --> 00:45:00,060
Ms. Seo,

689
00:45:00,929 --> 00:45:02,270
I'll create...

690
00:45:02,600 --> 00:45:03,739
another best moment for you.

691
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:07,110
You're an inspiration, Ms. Seo.

692
00:45:07,739 --> 00:45:09,110
Being someone's mentor in life...

693
00:45:10,110 --> 00:45:12,009
makes passion burn inside you.

694
00:45:22,089 --> 00:45:23,719
- I'll head in, then. - Wait.

695
00:45:27,460 --> 00:45:28,460
I'll do it.

696
00:45:30,159 --> 00:45:31,259
A one-on-one tutoring...

697
00:45:33,159 --> 00:45:34,429
That's my speciality.

698
00:45:37,199 --> 00:45:39,639
It's just one student. You know?

699
00:45:41,139 --> 00:45:43,369
No one can do a better job than me.

700
00:45:44,040 --> 00:45:45,679
And I have the proof right here.

701
00:45:55,449 --> 00:45:56,449
Gosh.

702
00:45:57,219 --> 00:45:59,589
Goodness. I must look like a mess right now.

703
00:46:01,190 --> 00:46:02,259
Not at all.

704
00:46:04,860 --> 00:46:05,900
Do I look okay?

705
00:46:06,299 --> 00:46:07,330
Mind-blowingly.

706
00:46:08,270 --> 00:46:09,428
You don't mind switching the order, right?

707
00:46:09,429 --> 00:46:10,838
Of course, not.

708
00:46:10,839 --> 00:46:12,469
I memorized them by heart that I can recite them in my sleep.

709
00:46:13,670 --> 00:46:15,040
Let's go inside.

710
00:46:24,920 --> 00:46:25,980
Nice to meet you.

711
00:46:28,089 --> 00:46:29,719
Thank you for waiting.

712
00:46:32,119 --> 00:46:33,928
Since I'm taking your precious time,

713
00:46:33,929 --> 00:46:36,060
I ought to give you an amazing lecture. Right?

714
00:46:37,299 --> 00:46:39,159
All right. Today,

715
00:46:40,770 --> 00:46:42,330
we will study...

716
00:46:42,969 --> 00:46:50,239
("Camera and...")

717
00:46:53,509 --> 00:46:55,480
("Camera and...")

718
00:46:59,549 --> 00:47:01,449
You know what? First of all,

719
00:47:02,690 --> 00:47:04,790
could I ask you what your name is?

720
00:47:05,719 --> 00:47:06,860
It's Lee Si Woo.

721
00:47:08,330 --> 00:47:09,360
Thank you.

722
00:47:18,069 --> 00:47:21,339
Si Woo. Have you heard of Park Wan Suh?

723
00:47:23,710 --> 00:47:24,710
Yes.

724
00:47:25,409 --> 00:47:27,850
Have you read her works other than the ones in the textbook?

725
00:47:28,380 --> 00:47:30,880
Yes. I have read a few of her works.

726
00:47:31,119 --> 00:47:33,179
Oh, my. A studious student has come to my lecture today.

727
00:47:33,850 --> 00:47:34,889
Great.

728
00:47:35,889 --> 00:47:37,658
Today, we'll study...

729
00:47:37,659 --> 00:47:39,589
"Camera and Combat Boots" which you can find in your textbook.

730
00:47:39,860 --> 00:47:40,929
But before we do that,

731
00:47:41,929 --> 00:47:44,560
let me tell you a little bit about her life.

732
00:47:45,730 --> 00:47:47,330
Put your pen down. You don't have to write this down.

733
00:47:51,969 --> 00:47:53,569
All right. The late writer, Park Wan Suh,

734
00:47:54,239 --> 00:47:56,269
never really liked it when her works...

735
00:47:56,270 --> 00:47:58,539
showed up in textbooks or the study aids...

736
00:47:58,540 --> 00:47:59,880
for the university entrance exam.

737
00:48:01,779 --> 00:48:03,150
But ironically,

738
00:48:03,850 --> 00:48:06,619
her works show up on the exams quite frequently.

739
00:48:07,350 --> 00:48:08,420
You know that, right?

740
00:48:11,119 --> 00:48:14,388
"The Naked Tree," "Winter Outing," "For the Dead Bird,"

741
00:48:14,389 --> 00:48:16,860
"The Bicycle Thief," and "The Butterfly of Illusion."

742
00:48:17,230 --> 00:48:19,729
You will be reading numerous works by the late writer...

743
00:48:19,730 --> 00:48:21,499
in the future.

744
00:48:21,500 --> 00:48:24,698
In other words, these adults around you...

745
00:48:24,699 --> 00:48:26,368
will stubbornly want you...

746
00:48:26,369 --> 00:48:29,040
to read the late writer's works.

747
00:48:29,969 --> 00:48:31,040
Why?

748
00:48:31,980 --> 00:48:33,040
Why do you think so?

749
00:48:36,110 --> 00:48:43,988
(Park Wan Suh)

750
00:48:43,989 --> 00:48:46,818
(Park Wan Suh, born in 1931, died in 2011)

751
00:48:46,819 --> 00:48:48,059
(Park Wan Suh, born in 1931, died in 2011)

752
00:48:48,060 --> 00:48:51,360
All right. In my opinion, the answer is in the numbers.

753
00:48:52,500 --> 00:48:54,428
First of all, you can sort of picture...

754
00:48:54,429 --> 00:48:56,428
a number of major events the writer must have experienced...

755
00:48:56,429 --> 00:48:57,639
in her lifetime.

756
00:49:01,009 --> 00:49:02,139
Liberation of Korea.

757
00:49:02,969 --> 00:49:04,009
And the Korean War.

758
00:49:08,449 --> 00:49:10,250
- The Internet? - Excellent.

759
00:49:10,420 --> 00:49:11,879
To use fancy terms, we can say...

760
00:49:11,880 --> 00:49:13,920
the war, the pain from the division of Korea,

761
00:49:14,089 --> 00:49:15,489
and the industrialization.

762
00:49:15,949 --> 00:49:18,118
The irrationalities and evils of human affairs...

763
00:49:18,119 --> 00:49:20,629
caused by these social changes...

764
00:49:20,630 --> 00:49:22,060
inspired the late writer.

765
00:49:22,560 --> 00:49:23,589
And there was one more inspiration.

766
00:49:24,230 --> 00:49:28,230
The late writer's mother who had a huge influence on her childhood.

767
00:49:29,830 --> 00:49:30,869
What do you think?

768
00:49:31,540 --> 00:49:33,239
Do you see why her works show up on the exams all the time?

769
00:49:35,869 --> 00:49:39,440
On that note, as long as you have a deep understanding of her life,

770
00:49:40,009 --> 00:49:42,209
you won't be scared to see any of her works pop up...

771
00:49:42,210 --> 00:49:43,509
on the exams. Right?

772
00:49:44,219 --> 00:49:46,020
Even if you're not familiar with the work.

773
00:49:48,020 --> 00:49:51,259
The late writer lost her father at the age of three.

774
00:49:52,460 --> 00:49:55,460
The cause of death was appendicitis.

775
00:49:56,830 --> 00:49:58,629
Korea was occupied by Japan back then.

776
00:49:58,630 --> 00:50:01,270
But appendicitis was treatable in hospitals.

777
00:50:02,069 --> 00:50:03,839
But why did her father die?

778
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:09,339
The late writer said this in one of her interviews.

779
00:50:09,839 --> 00:50:11,738
"They tried to treat him with acupuncture and a ritual."

780
00:50:11,739 --> 00:50:14,149
"But by the time he was transported to the town area on a cart,"

781
00:50:14,150 --> 00:50:15,710
"it was too late."

782
00:50:19,520 --> 00:50:21,920
Who do you think was shocked the most by this incident?

783
00:50:25,389 --> 00:50:27,860
- His wife? - Bingo. It was her father's wife.

784
00:50:28,190 --> 00:50:29,989
In other words, it was the late writer's mother.

785
00:50:30,830 --> 00:50:34,299
Leaving her mother out while talking about her life is impossible.

786
00:50:34,770 --> 00:50:36,368
Her mother had always been highly interested in...

787
00:50:36,369 --> 00:50:37,939
her children's education, to begin with.

788
00:50:37,940 --> 00:50:40,670
After this incident, her mother got this strong desire...

789
00:50:40,869 --> 00:50:42,508
that she would educate her children...

790
00:50:42,509 --> 00:50:44,409
in the most modern way no matter what.

791
00:50:45,210 --> 00:50:47,209
Back then, the late writer was studying...

792
00:50:47,210 --> 00:50:48,810
"Thousand Character Classic" from her grandfather.

793
00:50:49,449 --> 00:50:50,719
But her mother said,

794
00:50:51,350 --> 00:50:53,779
"That's not a real education. It's just learning a trick."

795
00:50:54,350 --> 00:50:57,360
She caused an uproar by dismissing the conventional education.

796
00:51:00,860 --> 00:51:02,330
I bet you were reminded of someone just now.

797
00:51:03,389 --> 00:51:05,229
Didn't you see a glimpse of the main character's mother...

798
00:51:05,230 --> 00:51:07,060
in "Camera and Combat Boots,"

799
00:51:07,699 --> 00:51:10,170
the novel we're going to study today?

800
00:51:14,270 --> 00:51:16,068
It's nice to meet you, Jun Ho.

801
00:51:16,069 --> 00:51:17,880
Yes. Come on in.

802
00:51:18,440 --> 00:51:22,408
So your son's grades are placed in the eighth class now.

803
00:51:22,409 --> 00:51:24,020
What do you think...

804
00:51:28,719 --> 00:51:29,790
Thank you.

805
00:51:38,360 --> 00:51:42,499
"From this passage, one can learn that..."

806
00:51:42,500 --> 00:51:44,899
"the main idea of the passage is..."

807
00:51:44,900 --> 00:51:46,699
"close to..."

808
00:51:46,969 --> 00:51:49,769
"The clear identity of the protagonist..."

809
00:51:49,770 --> 00:51:52,880
"was never revealed..."

810
00:51:53,040 --> 00:51:54,549
"Looking at this,"

811
00:51:55,409 --> 00:51:57,379
"which answer best represents..."

812
00:51:57,380 --> 00:51:59,819
"the personality of the protagonist..."

813
00:52:00,150 --> 00:52:01,650
"according to..."

814
00:52:17,770 --> 00:52:21,069
("Outline of the Administrative Law")

815
00:52:21,739 --> 00:52:22,810
Si Woo.

816
00:52:23,210 --> 00:52:25,238
Do you know what the camera...

817
00:52:25,239 --> 00:52:26,940
and the combat boots symbolize?

818
00:52:28,250 --> 00:52:29,710
- Yes. - Tell me.

819
00:52:30,049 --> 00:52:31,850
The camera symbolizes the main character's idea...

820
00:52:32,350 --> 00:52:34,449
and the combat boots symbolize the main character's reality.

821
00:52:34,920 --> 00:52:35,949
Excellent.

822
00:52:36,850 --> 00:52:38,719
All right. Then let me tell you this.

823
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:25,770
The character A in this piece.

824
00:53:25,969 --> 00:53:27,299
Who's the character A here?

825
00:53:28,270 --> 00:53:29,310
It's Hoon.

826
00:53:31,739 --> 00:53:32,739
I doubt that you can answer this.

827
00:53:33,040 --> 00:53:34,408
"In this line,"

828
00:53:34,409 --> 00:53:37,048
"it talks about the symbol of the novel."

829
00:53:37,049 --> 00:53:39,520
"Through the symbol, he talks about..."

830
00:53:49,259 --> 00:53:51,699
So what do you think? That's the answer?

831
00:54:11,080 --> 00:54:12,449
(Result: Lee Jun Ho, Accepted)

832
00:54:19,520 --> 00:54:20,589
Ms. Seo...

833
00:54:23,929 --> 00:54:25,429
I got in.

834
00:54:34,710 --> 00:54:36,040
I got in.

835
00:54:51,989 --> 00:54:55,759
(Daechi Chase, Enjoy the competition)

836
00:55:01,199 --> 00:55:04,029
(Main Instructor of Daechi Chase, Seo Hye Jin)

837
00:55:08,139 --> 00:55:09,169
Ta-da.

838
00:55:09,170 --> 00:55:10,170
(My Pride)

839
00:55:11,139 --> 00:55:12,239
Isn't this awesome or what?

840
00:55:28,130 --> 00:55:29,988
(Daechi Chase)

841
00:55:29,989 --> 00:55:32,729
To properly understand "Hunminjeongeum Created by Sejong,"

842
00:55:32,730 --> 00:55:34,569
the basic concept of middle-age Korean...

843
00:55:34,799 --> 00:55:37,170
must be ingrained in your head like a photograph. Okay?

844
00:55:37,699 --> 00:55:39,238
Let's take a look at the rules of creation first.

845
00:55:39,239 --> 00:55:41,210
What are the rules of creation?

846
00:55:41,310 --> 00:55:43,869
Hieroglyphs, added strokes, exceptions.

847
00:55:46,509 --> 00:55:48,710
I see. So you know all of this off the top of your head.

848
00:55:51,080 --> 00:55:53,420
- When were they created? - In 1443.

849
00:55:53,650 --> 00:55:55,420
They were promulgated in 1446.

850
00:55:57,719 --> 00:55:58,719
Hey.

851
00:55:59,489 --> 00:56:01,929
I just had a glimpse at how Jung Yak Yong must have felt...

852
00:56:02,130 --> 00:56:03,360
when he met Hwang Sang.

853
00:56:04,199 --> 00:56:05,199
Look at this guy.

854
00:56:05,529 --> 00:56:07,198
Let's take a look at the rules of creation one at a time.

855
00:56:07,199 --> 00:56:08,368
The rules are...

856
00:56:08,369 --> 00:56:11,540
initial consonants, middle vowels, and final consonants.

857
00:56:11,699 --> 00:56:13,299
Let's start with the initial consonants.

858
00:56:14,409 --> 00:56:16,440
As for the rules of the initial consonants,

859
00:56:18,080 --> 00:56:19,179
basically,

860
00:56:19,909 --> 00:56:21,710
we have the rules of hieroglyphs...

861
00:56:22,949 --> 00:56:23,949
There's one more.

862
00:56:23,950 --> 00:56:25,880
There are rules of the added strokes too.

863
00:56:47,170 --> 00:56:49,810
This ends the sample lecture we have prepared for you.

864
00:56:50,509 --> 00:56:51,610
Was it helpful?

865
00:56:52,909 --> 00:56:53,909
Yes.

866
00:56:53,910 --> 00:56:55,548
The registration begins on the following Wednesday.

867
00:56:55,549 --> 00:56:58,080
Check our homepage for the curriculum and the tuition.

868
00:57:32,049 --> 00:57:35,988
(The best Korean lectures so far weren't actually the best!)

869

(Daechi Chase's miracle Lee Jun Ho, Main instructor Seo Hye Jin)

870
00:57:40,119 --> 00:57:44,299
(The best Korean lectures so far weren't actually the best!)

871
00:57:49,429 --> 00:57:54,739
(A teacher and student sally forth.)

872
00:58:25,199 --> 00:58:27,000
Ms. Seo. I'll get going first.

873
00:58:27,500 --> 00:58:30,270
I hope you can feel better. Cheer up. Min Ji.

874

(I hope you can feel better. Cheer up. Min Ji.)

876
00:58:39,150 --> 00:58:40,179
Gosh.

877
00:58:41,250 --> 00:58:43,489
I'm getting a flood of comforting and cheering messages.

878
00:58:45,790 --> 00:58:47,060
You're still here?

879
00:58:47,619 --> 00:58:48,630
Yes.

880
00:59:06,210 --> 00:59:07,279
What's this?

881
00:59:07,710 --> 00:59:11,080
I always get so hungry after teaching a class.

882
00:59:17,350 --> 00:59:19,290
I'm sorry. Thank you. Wait.

883
00:59:19,790 --> 00:59:21,489
Excuse me. Sorry about this.

884
00:59:29,130 --> 00:59:30,170
What's going on?

885
00:59:31,100 --> 00:59:32,539
I hope you didn't forget about our plan...

886
00:59:32,540 --> 00:59:33,540
because you're overwhelmed...

887
00:59:33,541 --> 00:59:35,040
by the thrill and joy.

888
00:59:35,969 --> 00:59:37,940
We have already prepared a feast for you.

889
00:59:38,679 --> 00:59:39,839
What? You're not coming?

890
00:59:42,679 --> 00:59:43,750
Any food for me?

891
00:59:45,549 --> 00:59:47,889
They aren't healthy foods anyway.

892
00:59:48,750 --> 00:59:49,790
So there's some for me.

893
00:59:51,159 --> 00:59:52,819
Come on. Let me take a look.

894
00:59:53,819 --> 00:59:55,460
- Well... - What did you buy?

895
00:59:56,029 --> 00:59:57,130
Let's go out.

896
00:59:58,659 --> 01:00:00,229
Even if it was a bust, it was still a big event.

897
01:00:00,230 --> 01:00:01,368
Now that it's over,

898
01:00:01,369 --> 01:00:02,799
we should have a wrap party.

899
01:00:04,940 --> 01:00:06,000
Let's go.

Hey.

903
01:01:11,569 --> 01:01:13,939
Gosh. You're finally here.

904
01:01:13,940 --> 01:01:15,909
Gosh. Good job.

905
01:01:17,009 --> 01:01:18,179
- Welcome. - Hey.

906
01:01:18,310 --> 01:01:19,839
Did it go well?

907
01:01:20,040 --> 01:01:21,980
Did you crush it? Did you get all of them to sign up?

908
01:01:23,110 --> 01:01:24,110
Yes?

909
01:01:24,619 --> 01:01:25,650
Let's sit down.

910
01:01:28,449 --> 01:01:30,489
She sounds like a total crazy witch.

911
01:01:31,690 --> 01:01:32,920
She's not crazy.

912
01:01:33,259 --> 01:01:36,190
She wanted to keep her students. Her action was understandable.

913
01:01:37,589 --> 01:01:39,029
I'm the one who lowered my guard.

914
01:01:42,230 --> 01:01:43,270
That was brutal.

915
01:01:48,139 --> 01:01:49,209
Gosh.

916
01:01:49,210 --> 01:01:50,338
(Forget about the teacher and student sally forth.)

917
01:01:50,339 --> 01:01:51,738
(I won't be able to finish my homework.)

918
01:01:51,739 --> 01:01:53,008
(I heard Si Woo was going to the free lecture.)

919
01:01:53,009 --> 01:01:54,409
(- Did Si Woo go? - I'm curious.)

920
01:02:01,690 --> 01:02:03,219
(I went to the lecture.)

921
01:02:03,619 --> 01:02:04,619
I went to the lecture.

922
01:02:05,319 --> 01:02:07,589
Gosh. Our supplementary lecture was so boring.

923
01:02:10,330 --> 01:02:12,000
Are they worth betraying Choisun Academy?

924
01:02:13,799 --> 01:02:15,130
Enough with the suspense, Si Woo.

925
01:02:17,529 --> 01:02:23,569
(I might switch. It was pretty good.)

926
01:02:24,270 --> 01:02:26,380
I might switch. It was pretty good.

927
01:02:27,509 --> 01:02:29,650
That's crazy. Was it that good?

928
01:02:30,210 --> 01:02:32,679
If Si Woo is switching, this is a whole new game then.

929
01:02:32,880 --> 01:02:34,920
No way. Will the top of our class betray Choisun Academy?

930
01:03:02,279 --> 01:03:05,920
(The Midnight Romance in Hagwon)

931
01:03:06,420 --> 01:03:08,388
Ms. Seo. Reduce the number of your lectures.

932
01:03:08,389 --> 01:03:10,549
Please spearhead the task force team for the Gangbuk branch.

933
01:03:10,650 --> 01:03:11,718
There's no such thing.

934
01:03:11,719 --> 01:03:13,520
He wants to kick me out empty-handed.

935
01:03:13,790 --> 01:03:15,659
Shouldn't you at least protest?

936
01:03:15,759 --> 01:03:17,259
It means it was a bust because of me, right?

937
01:03:18,060 --> 01:03:19,830
Their lecture was interesting?

938
01:03:20,560 --> 01:03:21,829
Lee Si Woo!

939
01:03:21,830 --> 01:03:24,399
I think my teaching style is too graceful for them.

940
01:03:24,400 --> 01:03:25,500
So I prepared this.

941
01:03:25,799 --> 01:03:27,699
Don't look at me like that. I won't go down that easily.

942
01:03:27,869 --> 01:03:29,909
Have you signed a contract for your next year's lectures?

943
01:03:30,239 --> 01:03:32,040
Why don't you sign one with me?
