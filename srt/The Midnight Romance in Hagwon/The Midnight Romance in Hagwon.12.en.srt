(Night Flight)

8
00:00:57,092 --> 00:00:59,461
It's a one-minute walk from that alley to the door.

9
00:01:01,831 --> 00:01:04,702
During the short time it took me to notice you and walk in,

10
00:01:06,931 --> 00:01:08,242
I had all sorts of thoughts.

11
00:01:08,341 --> 00:01:10,642
- Mr. Lee. - Who asked to see whom?

12
00:01:12,041 --> 00:01:13,811
What more could you have to talk about?

13
00:01:14,481 --> 00:01:16,082
What is Choi Hyung Sun up to now?

14
00:01:16,711 --> 00:01:18,481
I asked to see Ms. Seo.

15
00:01:18,811 --> 00:01:19,981
What about?

16
00:01:21,582 --> 00:01:22,621
Why should I...

17
00:01:23,451 --> 00:01:25,791
tell you that?

18
00:01:26,192 --> 00:01:28,291
Mr. Lee. Wait back at the academy.

19
00:01:33,461 --> 00:01:35,502
I think I should leave.

20
00:01:35,502 --> 00:01:36,532
Could you stay...

21
00:01:37,731 --> 00:01:39,071
and finish the conversation?

22
00:01:41,272 --> 00:01:43,401
The thought of you two meeting again is displeasing.

23
00:01:43,802 --> 00:01:45,472
Will you leave?

24
00:01:53,582 --> 00:01:54,681
I know that...

25
00:01:55,882 --> 00:01:57,692
you were a long-time student and teacher,

26
00:01:58,552 --> 00:02:00,352
and that you taught a class together.

27
00:02:01,261 --> 00:02:03,022
Even so, what you're saying...

28
00:02:04,022 --> 00:02:06,832
sounds a bit strange, Mr. Lee. It's almost as if you're...

29
00:02:06,832 --> 00:02:08,662
I think you're the stranger one.

30
00:02:10,731 --> 00:02:12,201
I keep getting ideas.

31
00:02:13,872 --> 00:02:15,801
Are you unsure you're good enough to beat us?

32
00:02:16,771 --> 00:02:18,972
So have you decided to try to shake us mentally?

33
00:02:24,312 --> 00:02:27,682
Someone copied all my teaching material.

34
00:02:32,122 --> 00:02:34,122
- What do you mean... - Watch your manners.

35
00:02:34,622 --> 00:02:37,592
Mr. Pyo asked to see me to tell me that.

36
00:02:40,132 --> 00:02:41,662
Seo Hye Jin.

37
00:02:43,132 --> 00:02:44,331
I'm here.

38
00:02:52,372 --> 00:02:53,912
Vice-director Ms. Woo has it.

39
00:02:54,382 --> 00:02:56,041
A USB flash drive with my material.

40
00:02:56,442 --> 00:02:59,352
She says it's all there, but no one has seen it.

41
00:02:59,451 --> 00:03:01,421
What assortment is that?

42
00:03:02,081 --> 00:03:04,282
- An academy gathering? - I don't know.

43
00:03:04,791 --> 00:03:07,891
I thought Lee Jun Ho wasn't here and hoped to hear Hye Jin talk.

44
00:03:07,891 --> 00:03:10,421
Let's listen later. I read the atmosphere wrong.

45
00:03:11,162 --> 00:03:12,162
Sit here.

46
00:03:13,062 --> 00:03:15,032
How can you believe it if no one saw the files?

47
00:03:16,361 --> 00:03:17,902
It could be a ploy to confuse us...

48
00:03:18,472 --> 00:03:19,872
or ruin our mentality.

49
00:03:21,171 --> 00:03:22,301
It's not.

50
00:03:23,201 --> 00:03:25,071
Vice-director Ms. Woo is the source.

51
00:03:30,942 --> 00:03:32,312
What will you do now?

52
00:03:34,451 --> 00:03:35,521
I don't know.

53
00:03:36,581 --> 00:03:38,192
This has never happened before.

54
00:03:39,722 --> 00:03:42,761
First of all, Choi Hyung Sun shouldn't know...

55
00:03:42,761 --> 00:03:44,391
you told me about this.

56
00:03:45,432 --> 00:03:47,361
You don't have to worry about me.

57
00:03:48,402 --> 00:03:50,231
The fact that I didn't show up...

58
00:03:52,502 --> 00:03:53,872
will have made me a marked man.

59
00:04:11,291 --> 00:04:14,692
Mr. Pyo didn't show up.

60
00:04:16,291 --> 00:04:18,062
No, I'm not displeased at all.

61
00:04:20,431 --> 00:04:23,262
Do we have any more reason to meet?

62
00:04:30,001 --> 00:04:32,972
The worst thing I can do is sue.

63
00:04:35,082 --> 00:04:37,082
"Woo Seung Hui stole Seo Hye Jin's material."

64
00:04:38,412 --> 00:04:40,452
To hear that one line in court,

65
00:04:40,452 --> 00:04:41,981
I must bet all I have,

66
00:04:41,981 --> 00:04:43,452
give up my livelihood, and fight.

67
00:04:44,491 --> 00:04:46,352
That's like walking voluntarily into a disaster...

68
00:04:46,551 --> 00:04:49,222
and throwing my money away with no known end.

69
00:04:51,061 --> 00:04:54,162
Even if I were to win in court, what good would that do?

70
00:04:54,162 --> 00:04:56,902
No one here will remember me by then.

71
00:04:59,472 --> 00:05:01,602
Isn't that what Woo Seung Hui wants?

72
00:05:06,842 --> 00:05:07,981
What will you do, then?

73
00:05:09,481 --> 00:05:10,912
I'm still thinking.

74
00:05:22,392 --> 00:05:23,462
Can't you...

75
00:05:24,291 --> 00:05:25,291
not think about it?

76
00:05:27,332 --> 00:05:29,032
Whoever Ms. Woo gives it to,

77
00:05:29,602 --> 00:05:32,272
however the receiver uses it, don't think or care.

78
00:05:32,272 --> 00:05:34,431
- What... - It's for the better.

79
00:05:35,202 --> 00:05:37,811
We can start over together and make something decent.

80
00:05:38,912 --> 00:05:41,212
Are you saying my material isn't decent?

81
00:05:42,481 --> 00:05:43,712
Don't ignore the point.

82
00:05:44,681 --> 00:05:47,512
I'm saying you can make something much better than that.

83
00:05:47,822 --> 00:05:49,981
Forget about possible problems and problem-solving skills.

84
00:05:50,751 --> 00:05:52,452
I want students to be able to read on their own.

85
00:05:52,452 --> 00:05:54,152
I thought we finished that discussion earlier.

86
00:05:54,152 --> 00:05:55,222
No.

87
00:05:56,022 --> 00:05:57,931
- It's just the beginning. - Gosh.

88
00:06:00,231 --> 00:06:01,231
Are you avoiding me?

89
00:06:06,032 --> 00:06:09,041
- Mr. Pyo, will you excuse us? - Sure.

90
00:06:17,012 --> 00:06:18,082
Listen.

91
00:06:19,512 --> 00:06:22,551
I'll explain it to you slowly and in steps.

92
00:06:22,881 --> 00:06:24,082
I won't say it twice.

93
00:06:24,722 --> 00:06:25,791
Concentrate.

94
00:06:26,621 --> 00:06:28,921
I'm not saying your idea is wrong.

95
00:06:28,921 --> 00:06:30,822
Do you think I never thought of that?

96
00:06:31,191 --> 00:06:33,291
As I listed possible exam questions and coached kids...

97
00:06:33,291 --> 00:06:34,902
on how to decipher certain problems,

98
00:06:34,902 --> 00:06:36,162
I felt bad too.

99
00:06:36,162 --> 00:06:37,902
"Gosh, this is such a great passage."

100
00:06:38,072 --> 00:06:39,332
"It's such a great novel,"

101
00:06:39,332 --> 00:06:42,072
"but the kids will forget about it the moment the KSAT's done."

102
00:06:42,072 --> 00:06:44,072
I got upset whenever I thought of that.

103
00:06:45,041 --> 00:06:47,712
But look. We must send them to university.

104
00:06:48,642 --> 00:06:51,811
You quit your job to teach to make a fortune in a short period.

105
00:06:52,452 --> 00:06:53,751
And what did you say earlier?

106
00:06:54,082 --> 00:06:56,051
I said I wanted to teach them how to read.

107
00:06:56,582 --> 00:06:58,352
If you can't follow every kid into...

108
00:06:58,352 --> 00:07:00,652
You don't have to say all that again.

109
00:07:01,491 --> 00:07:04,262
First, that method was never proven.

110
00:07:04,262 --> 00:07:06,592
All you're saying is that you'll use kids as guinea pigs.

111
00:07:06,592 --> 00:07:08,801
Second. Even if your method works,

112
00:07:08,801 --> 00:07:10,462
the effects will appear very slowly.

113
00:07:10,462 --> 00:07:12,472
You don't have to say all that again either.

114
00:07:14,801 --> 00:07:16,001
Lastly,

115
00:07:16,441 --> 00:07:18,041
even if you overcome all the weaknesses,

116
00:07:18,041 --> 00:07:20,441
your method can never be applied to school exams.

117
00:07:22,712 --> 00:07:23,842
It's okay.

118
00:07:24,012 --> 00:07:27,111
Because every teacher teaches different things in different ways.

119
00:07:32,092 --> 00:07:33,191
Ms. Seo.

120
00:07:34,791 --> 00:07:35,791
First.

121
00:07:36,462 --> 00:07:39,231
Saying I'll use kids as guinea pigs is an insult.

122
00:07:40,762 --> 00:07:42,231
Don't you feel sorry for them?

123
00:07:42,962 --> 00:07:44,602
They worry they'll come up against a problem...

124
00:07:44,832 --> 00:07:47,431
they're not familiar with or one no one said would be in the exam.

125
00:07:47,671 --> 00:07:48,801
Don't you pity them?

126
00:07:50,241 --> 00:07:51,842
Exams aren't a game of chance.

127
00:07:51,842 --> 00:07:53,541
- That's why... - I'm not done yet.

128
00:07:53,541 --> 00:07:54,572
Don't you interrupt me.

129
00:07:54,572 --> 00:07:57,412
I'm not your eighth-class student. I'm an instructor who's your equal.

130
00:08:00,082 --> 00:08:01,212
Second.

131
00:08:02,181 --> 00:08:04,452
Saying the effects will be slow is an insult to the students.

132
00:08:04,691 --> 00:08:06,322
Kids that age have brains that whiz.

133
00:08:06,322 --> 00:08:07,991
Fine. It's a stalemate. Let's end it.

134
00:08:07,991 --> 00:08:09,061
Third.

135
00:08:09,921 --> 00:08:11,592
School exams and the KSAT are different?

136
00:08:13,532 --> 00:08:14,592
They follow the same rules.

137
00:08:14,592 --> 00:08:17,931
You need to get a good understanding of your position and your job.

138
00:08:18,102 --> 00:08:20,902
You're the one who needs to understand your position.

139
00:08:21,642 --> 00:08:24,171
You're not a civil servant who's guaranteed a retirement.

140
00:08:26,171 --> 00:08:28,082
Think of your future with a level head.

141
00:08:29,582 --> 00:08:31,782
Do you actually believe what Choi Hyung Sun said...

142
00:08:31,782 --> 00:08:32,852
about you being like her?

143
00:08:33,652 --> 00:08:35,022
Do you think you can do this...

144
00:08:35,251 --> 00:08:37,322
for 20 more years like the White Haired Witch?

145
00:08:39,151 --> 00:08:41,761
Gosh. You should watch your language.

146
00:08:41,761 --> 00:08:43,192
Who are you comparing me to?

147
00:08:43,192 --> 00:08:44,991
That's not the point.

148
00:08:45,932 --> 00:08:47,661
Let's consider your future.

149
00:08:48,501 --> 00:08:50,631
Who do you think angers me the most?

150
00:08:51,062 --> 00:08:52,631
Woo Seung Hui who stole my material?

151
00:08:52,871 --> 00:08:54,672
Choi Hyung Sun who's trying to use it?

152
00:08:54,672 --> 00:08:56,901
No. It's you.

153
00:08:58,771 --> 00:09:01,582
They at least value my work highly.

154
00:09:01,582 --> 00:09:02,911
What are you saying?

155
00:09:03,511 --> 00:09:06,312
Can you treat all I worked for like it's nothing?

156
00:09:06,981 --> 00:09:09,751
What they value is your past ten years.

157
00:09:10,322 --> 00:09:12,322
I'm talking about your future.

158
00:09:12,322 --> 00:09:13,352
That's enough.

159
00:09:13,491 --> 00:09:15,822
I didn't waste my life that I need someone to worry about my future.

160
00:09:18,261 --> 00:09:19,292
Am I just someone?

161
00:09:20,092 --> 00:09:22,631
You don't just belittle my teaching material.

162
00:09:22,631 --> 00:09:25,572
You're belittling my efforts, know-how, results too.

163
00:09:25,572 --> 00:09:27,972
I wouldn't ask for permission if I didn't think much of you.

164
00:09:28,542 --> 00:09:30,271
I'd just do what I want.

165
00:09:30,602 --> 00:09:32,511
Because succeed or fail, it's on me.

166
00:09:33,641 --> 00:09:36,011
- I won't fail, though. - Do you think I will?

167
00:09:37,342 --> 00:09:39,182
I take that back. That was childish.

168
00:09:39,182 --> 00:09:40,182
No.

169
00:09:41,011 --> 00:09:42,621
I think this could ruin you.

170
00:09:43,922 --> 00:09:45,352
If you don't quit being so stubborn.

171
00:09:46,452 --> 00:09:48,021
I told you to watch your language.

172
00:09:48,192 --> 00:09:50,121
What have you accomplished so far?

173
00:09:50,962 --> 00:09:52,531
Aren't you a castle built with sand...

174
00:09:52,531 --> 00:09:53,692
that falls if someone steals your material?

175
00:09:53,692 --> 00:09:55,932
- Are you crazy? - No. I'm perfectly sane.

176
00:09:56,761 --> 00:09:59,072
I'm sorry no one around here is as sane as me.

177
00:09:59,401 --> 00:10:01,901
What do you get from mocking and aggravating me?

178
00:10:04,271 --> 00:10:05,312
A long life together?

179
00:10:08,042 --> 00:10:10,212
Oh, dear.

180
00:10:10,812 --> 00:10:11,911
Goodness.

181
00:10:17,281 --> 00:10:19,792
It's the first time I wore this after having it dry-cleaned.

182
00:10:19,952 --> 00:10:20,952
Oh, no.

183
00:10:21,792 --> 00:10:24,692
First in class, first in their year. Is that good enough?

184
00:10:25,631 --> 00:10:27,562
Don't you want to teach the top student in the country?

185
00:10:28,062 --> 00:10:30,432
Let's do that and live in luxury for the rest of our lives.

186
00:10:31,531 --> 00:10:33,932
I'm sorry. For now, do you think...

187
00:10:35,172 --> 00:10:37,602
You want to teach the top student in the country?

188
00:10:39,411 --> 00:10:40,442
Yes.

189
00:10:42,182 --> 00:10:43,241
Isn't your academy...

190
00:10:43,881 --> 00:10:46,852
famous for helping kids improve their grade class?

191
00:10:46,952 --> 00:10:50,552
They said Ms. Seo even taught where I paused to breathe.

192
00:10:51,792 --> 00:10:54,722
I want to make it so kids can tackle any kind of passage.

193
00:10:54,861 --> 00:10:56,722
You should go.

194
00:10:58,292 --> 00:10:59,661
If you have the time,

195
00:11:00,731 --> 00:11:01,962
I'd like to chat some more.

196
00:11:03,531 --> 00:11:04,631
With Mr. Lee.

197
00:11:05,271 --> 00:11:06,332
(Lecture Plan)

198
00:11:07,972 --> 00:11:09,401
(Focus on learning attitude)

199
00:11:09,401 --> 00:11:11,371
This punk...

200
00:11:11,672 --> 00:11:13,172
I told him not to do this.

201
00:11:13,271 --> 00:11:16,011
Did you two talk about this?

202
00:11:16,641 --> 00:11:18,611
I gave him some advice.

203
00:11:19,452 --> 00:11:21,182
That he should focus on memory skills...

204
00:11:21,182 --> 00:11:22,881
if he wants to be a Gangnam landlord.

205
00:11:22,881 --> 00:11:23,922
I see.

206
00:11:24,722 --> 00:11:27,322
Then is this a dud?

207
00:11:28,692 --> 00:11:29,722
It's not a dud.

208
00:11:31,792 --> 00:11:32,861
What?

209
00:11:33,391 --> 00:11:35,102
It's how Ms. Seo used to teach.

210
00:11:36,131 --> 00:11:37,501
It's how she taught me too.

211
00:11:38,131 --> 00:11:41,542
That means it's a dud now.

212
00:11:42,202 --> 00:11:43,972
Why do you keep saying "dud?"

213
00:11:46,712 --> 00:11:49,281
Ms. Seo evolved over ten years...

214
00:11:49,281 --> 00:11:50,842
and became a weapon targeting Chanyoung High.

215
00:11:51,981 --> 00:11:53,812
Jun Ho's aiming for a different market.

216
00:11:54,651 --> 00:11:57,722
But there's no guarantee this will work.

217
00:11:58,352 --> 00:11:59,422
Oh, dear.

218
00:12:00,222 --> 00:12:03,292
Will you put it simply? I'm confused.

219
00:12:08,631 --> 00:12:11,702
If I had a kid, I'd get them to take Jun Ho's class.

220
00:12:12,432 --> 00:12:13,472
Why?

221
00:12:13,932 --> 00:12:15,741
The reasons are all there.

222
00:12:16,572 --> 00:12:18,641
They learn to think at a high level,

223
00:12:18,842 --> 00:12:21,442
and the skills apply to all other subjects.

224
00:12:21,842 --> 00:12:22,881
Really?

225
00:12:25,082 --> 00:12:28,781
The biggest issue is if the students will feel him.

226
00:12:31,121 --> 00:12:32,621
Even if they don't, it's just an academy.

227
00:12:33,052 --> 00:12:34,092
They'll get a refund.

228
00:12:36,192 --> 00:12:37,722
We can't allow that.

229
00:12:43,031 --> 00:12:44,062
How interesting.

230
00:12:45,231 --> 00:12:46,501
It's irresponsible nonsense.

231
00:12:48,871 --> 00:12:50,241
I don't think it's nonsense.

232
00:12:53,842 --> 00:12:55,281
It sounds more like an ideal.

233
00:12:59,682 --> 00:13:01,481
Do you know what someone said to me...

234
00:13:02,381 --> 00:13:04,322
right before I resigned?

235
00:13:04,922 --> 00:13:05,952
Can you just...

236
00:13:07,222 --> 00:13:08,792
not do anything?

237
00:13:11,661 --> 00:13:12,692
Please.

238
00:13:16,031 --> 00:13:18,302
- I apologize. - Don't.

239
00:13:19,802 --> 00:13:21,531
I didn't say that to get an apology.

240
00:13:22,901 --> 00:13:25,712
Without lining up the kids in order of their grades...

241
00:13:26,472 --> 00:13:28,172
Teaching them how to really read...

242
00:13:28,611 --> 00:13:29,981
and appreciate literature.

243
00:13:31,712 --> 00:13:32,781
And to achieve that,

244
00:13:33,552 --> 00:13:36,552
you teach kids your own way.

245
00:13:37,521 --> 00:13:38,592
That's...

246
00:13:41,322 --> 00:13:43,361
the dream of every teacher out there.

247
00:13:47,761 --> 00:13:48,932
It's paradoxical...

248
00:13:50,202 --> 00:13:52,802
that it can be done at an academy and not at a school, though.

249
00:13:58,241 --> 00:13:59,271
Gosh.

250
00:14:00,271 --> 00:14:02,442
We kept your friend waiting for long enough.

251
00:14:04,582 --> 00:14:06,352
I should leave.

252
00:14:19,861 --> 00:14:20,891
Excuse me.

253
00:14:22,161 --> 00:14:25,202
Mr. Pyo. Leave it.

254
00:14:25,202 --> 00:14:26,802
No, let me.

255
00:14:26,802 --> 00:14:28,871
No, really. It's fine.

256
00:14:29,501 --> 00:14:30,572
Go on home.

257
00:14:30,572 --> 00:14:33,212
(Night Flight)

258
00:14:51,962 --> 00:14:52,991
Mr. Pyo.

259
00:14:56,832 --> 00:14:57,962
I apologize.

260
00:15:00,371 --> 00:15:01,432
For being so rude.

261
00:15:04,401 --> 00:15:05,472
I enjoyed it.

262
00:15:08,812 --> 00:15:09,881
I hadn't had...

263
00:15:11,182 --> 00:15:12,281
that much fun in a while.

264
00:15:31,901 --> 00:15:32,932
So...

265
00:15:33,371 --> 00:15:36,072
to mess with Choisun Academy and your vice-director...

266
00:15:36,741 --> 00:15:39,042
that's trying to take you down...

267
00:15:39,712 --> 00:15:41,011
The idea he came up with...

268
00:15:41,111 --> 00:15:42,812
Yes. I think he lost his mind.

269
00:15:44,741 --> 00:15:46,781
No? Did I lose my mind?

270
00:15:49,381 --> 00:15:52,222
Everything he said seemed to make sense.

271
00:16:06,802 --> 00:16:08,572
I won't apologize for anything...

272
00:16:10,572 --> 00:16:11,702
I said today.

273
00:16:14,241 --> 00:16:15,241
Okay.

274
00:16:18,511 --> 00:16:19,981
I'm going somewhere else.

275
00:16:20,381 --> 00:16:22,582
- Where? - The sea.

276
00:16:25,822 --> 00:16:26,891
The real sea.

277
00:16:28,491 --> 00:16:29,962
I had a really stressful day.

278
00:16:30,962 --> 00:16:31,991
Lean back.

279
00:16:33,131 --> 00:16:35,562
I'll get you there so you see the sun rise when you wake up.

280
00:16:37,432 --> 00:16:39,472
The engine's quiet enough so you can sleep.

281
00:16:39,972 --> 00:16:42,271
Who goes on a trip like this...

282
00:16:42,271 --> 00:16:43,442
with zero preparation?

283
00:16:44,702 --> 00:16:47,342
When you threatened not to hire me...

284
00:16:47,411 --> 00:16:48,781
I didn't threaten you.

285
00:16:49,411 --> 00:16:51,481
You called me to Mount Nam.

286
00:16:52,511 --> 00:16:54,781
You told me to see the bigger world.

287
00:16:56,121 --> 00:16:58,322
Yes. I said that.

288
00:16:59,822 --> 00:17:00,891
It's something like that.

289
00:17:02,962 --> 00:17:06,491
I want you to see something wide and refreshing.

290
00:17:08,901 --> 00:17:10,461
You have such a nice car,

291
00:17:11,361 --> 00:17:13,471
and you can't remember what the sea looks like.

292
00:17:19,171 --> 00:17:20,812
We'll be back before tomorrow evening.

293
00:17:31,822 --> 00:17:33,221
I can't be a relief driver.

294
00:17:34,451 --> 00:17:36,121
I think I messed up.

295
00:17:36,522 --> 00:17:37,861
What? How?

296
00:17:39,631 --> 00:17:41,032
Last fall.

297
00:17:41,492 --> 00:17:43,961
Hye Jin almost moved to another academy.

298
00:17:44,232 --> 00:17:45,772
Yes, she did.

299
00:17:46,572 --> 00:17:48,871
I should've put more pressure on her.

300
00:17:49,342 --> 00:17:50,572
To make the move.

301
00:17:51,342 --> 00:17:52,411
Why didn't you?

302
00:17:54,542 --> 00:17:56,941
I think it was one weekend morning.

303
00:17:58,911 --> 00:18:01,752
Hye Jin came to see me to thank me for reviewing...

304
00:18:02,052 --> 00:18:04,651
her contract and to say she wouldn't make the move.

305
00:18:06,451 --> 00:18:09,492
She actually hummed a song.

306
00:18:09,762 --> 00:18:11,661
- Who, Hye Jin? - It's weird, isn't it?

307
00:18:11,661 --> 00:18:12,661
Yes.

308
00:18:12,961 --> 00:18:14,161
It was a first.

309
00:18:15,131 --> 00:18:17,062
The air around her felt softer.

310
00:18:18,631 --> 00:18:21,131
I thought it was just because of Mr. Lee.

311
00:18:21,602 --> 00:18:22,671
I liked it.

312
00:18:23,901 --> 00:18:26,072
She had no one to lean on.

313
00:18:26,572 --> 00:18:27,812
At work,

314
00:18:28,542 --> 00:18:30,411
she's a machine that brings in more students.

315
00:18:30,582 --> 00:18:32,951
To the students, she's a machine that improves their grades.

316
00:18:34,752 --> 00:18:38,082
I thought she had finally found a way to breathe.

317
00:18:38,181 --> 00:18:39,721
You were right about that.

318
00:18:41,191 --> 00:18:44,721
I didn't think her young pupil would shake her up so badly.

319
00:18:46,161 --> 00:18:48,802
I don't know about the KSAT and education system,

320
00:18:49,661 --> 00:18:51,661
but isn't what Mr. Lee said right?

321
00:18:52,802 --> 00:18:54,171
What's right...

322
00:18:54,901 --> 00:18:57,602
doesn't always bring in money.

323
00:18:58,072 --> 00:19:00,911
You said you felt sorry that she was a sales machine.

324
00:19:03,812 --> 00:19:04,881
Darn it.

325
00:19:05,582 --> 00:19:07,252
There was a guy from the training institute...

326
00:19:07,252 --> 00:19:09,621
who pestered me to set him up with Hye Jin.

327
00:19:09,881 --> 00:19:11,482
I should have.

328
00:19:11,482 --> 00:19:14,752
Gosh. You're an arrogant lady.

329
00:19:14,921 --> 00:19:15,961
Me?

330
00:19:15,961 --> 00:19:17,792
- Do you think... - Why?

331
00:19:17,792 --> 00:19:19,492
you can make someone fall in love?

332
00:19:19,492 --> 00:19:22,631
Why are you being so right tonight?

333
00:20:08,842 --> 00:20:09,941
Oh, the battery.

334
00:20:20,651 --> 00:20:21,651
My gosh.

335
00:20:22,921 --> 00:20:23,992
Did I wake you?

336
00:20:24,592 --> 00:20:25,732
You should've woken me up.

337
00:20:27,332 --> 00:20:29,901
Oh... My gosh.

338
00:20:31,431 --> 00:20:32,732
I talked about the sunrise, but...

339
00:20:33,901 --> 00:20:35,441
I'm so pathetic.

340
00:20:35,772 --> 00:20:37,201
You're not pathetic.

341
00:20:37,802 --> 00:20:39,812
I should've set an alarm.

342
00:20:39,812 --> 00:20:40,871
It's fine.

343
00:20:43,211 --> 00:20:44,211
Let's go outside.

344
00:20:45,711 --> 00:20:46,951
I'd been wanting to,

345
00:20:46,951 --> 00:20:48,852
but I couldn't in case I woke you.

346
00:20:52,792 --> 00:20:53,852
Gosh...

347
00:20:54,492 --> 00:20:55,621
Goodness.

348
00:20:59,131 --> 00:21:00,992
It doesn't feel real.

349
00:21:02,062 --> 00:21:05,062
Just a few hours ago, I was walking about Gangnam in the rain.

350
00:21:07,102 --> 00:21:08,232
This is a different world.

351
00:21:09,542 --> 00:21:10,602
Aren't you glad we came?

352
00:21:10,772 --> 00:21:13,542
Yes. I didn't know it was such a quick drive.

353
00:21:20,381 --> 00:21:22,621
It reminds me of when we met on Mount Nam.

354
00:21:26,451 --> 00:21:29,161
I tried to dissuade you and got taught a lesson instead.

355
00:21:30,461 --> 00:21:32,361
I taught you a lesson?

356
00:21:33,792 --> 00:21:35,361
You threatened me back.

357
00:21:35,361 --> 00:21:37,602
"Can the academy know about this?"

358
00:21:37,602 --> 00:21:38,631
That's what you said.

359
00:21:41,572 --> 00:21:43,201
I failed on Mount Nam,

360
00:21:43,542 --> 00:21:44,871
but you succeeded.

361
00:21:47,772 --> 00:21:48,782
Then...

362
00:21:50,842 --> 00:21:52,042
Do what you want.

363
00:21:53,151 --> 00:21:54,881
Teach however the way you want.

364
00:21:57,881 --> 00:21:58,921
I knew you'd approve.

365
00:21:59,792 --> 00:22:01,691
I'd have gone ahead even if you didn't.

366
00:22:03,221 --> 00:22:04,621
You'd have just gone ahead?

367
00:22:04,621 --> 00:22:06,832
No. I'd have kept on trying to persuade you.

368
00:22:07,332 --> 00:22:08,562
However long it took.

369
00:22:09,661 --> 00:22:11,032
I don't nag for too long.

370
00:22:14,032 --> 00:22:16,842
Have a sense of responsibility. The kids' lives are at stake.

371
00:22:17,802 --> 00:22:18,842
You bet.

372
00:22:20,911 --> 00:22:22,181
Do you need help?

373
00:22:22,911 --> 00:22:24,482
You need to make a textbook.

374
00:22:27,151 --> 00:22:28,211
Not like that.

375
00:22:29,752 --> 00:22:31,752
I want to research and make the textbook with you.

376
00:22:32,921 --> 00:22:35,221
It will be fun and incredible.

377
00:22:39,032 --> 00:22:40,062
No.

378
00:22:41,661 --> 00:22:43,901
I didn't achieve what I did so easily that I'd give up...

379
00:22:44,502 --> 00:22:46,401
after a few short chats with you.

380
00:22:46,572 --> 00:22:48,171
It's not a castle made of sand either.

381
00:22:48,732 --> 00:22:50,242
I didn't say you achieved it easily.

382
00:22:51,471 --> 00:22:54,012
I'm saying we should have more fun teaching and make more money.

383
00:22:55,371 --> 00:22:57,482
I can entice the smartest kids in the country.

384
00:22:57,482 --> 00:22:58,611
Wake up.

385
00:22:58,611 --> 00:23:01,312
We're not trying to teach people who'll end up in textbooks.

386
00:23:01,312 --> 00:23:03,451
Send them to the best university and medical school. That's it.

387
00:23:03,451 --> 00:23:05,552
I have a truckload of students under my belt.

388
00:23:06,191 --> 00:23:07,621
You have nothing.

389
00:23:07,621 --> 00:23:09,062
Other than a fighting spirit.

390
00:23:10,792 --> 00:23:12,391
The start is always the hardest.

391
00:23:12,661 --> 00:23:15,532
So stop wasting energy trying to persuade me.

392
00:23:15,532 --> 00:23:16,762
You have much more to do.

393
00:23:30,411 --> 00:23:31,411
How pretty.

394
00:23:34,611 --> 00:23:37,681
First. We must be extra careful when we make an exception...

395
00:23:37,681 --> 00:23:39,092
within an organization.

396
00:23:39,292 --> 00:23:40,621
Once you make an exception,

397
00:23:40,621 --> 00:23:42,762
there's no knowing what other demands will be made.

398
00:23:43,292 --> 00:23:44,792
That's true.

399
00:23:44,861 --> 00:23:47,461
Second. Mr. Lee hasn't proven...

400
00:23:47,461 --> 00:23:49,131
anything to us yet.

401
00:23:50,631 --> 00:23:51,701
Well...

402
00:23:52,701 --> 00:23:54,802
He did well with the test lecture,

403
00:23:54,802 --> 00:23:57,742
and he got enough students to start a Heewon High class.

404
00:23:57,742 --> 00:24:00,171
The test lecture was just a ten-minute event,

405
00:24:00,171 --> 00:24:03,381
and the Heewon class would've been impossible without Ms. Seo.

406
00:24:05,312 --> 00:24:06,352
And lastly.

407
00:24:07,982 --> 00:24:10,552
Goodness. This is a huge problem.

408
00:24:11,921 --> 00:24:14,822
Are the contents that big a problem?

409
00:24:14,822 --> 00:24:17,492
"Training how to appreciate literature..."

410
00:24:17,492 --> 00:24:19,992
"will improve understanding of people and the world."

411
00:24:19,992 --> 00:24:20,992
What kind of...

412
00:24:21,992 --> 00:24:23,701
stupidity do you think this is?

413
00:24:25,002 --> 00:24:26,002
Right?

414
00:24:27,302 --> 00:24:30,072
If an academy were to allocate a room to this class...

415
00:24:32,272 --> 00:24:34,441
Wouldn't it upset the other instructors?

416
00:24:35,211 --> 00:24:38,242
A lot of them trust and believe in you.

417
00:24:40,352 --> 00:24:41,411
Goodness.

418
00:24:42,822 --> 00:24:44,282
You always...

419
00:24:44,951 --> 00:24:47,621
teach me so much, Ms. Woo.

420
00:24:49,262 --> 00:24:50,391
You flatter me.

421
00:24:50,661 --> 00:24:54,562
I'll pass on what you said to Mr. Lee.

422
00:24:55,961 --> 00:24:57,002
(Daechi Chase)

423
00:24:59,201 --> 00:25:01,272
I have plans as well.

424
00:25:01,272 --> 00:25:02,502
- I see. - Yes.

425
00:25:04,401 --> 00:25:05,911
(Vice-director's Office)

426
00:25:11,282 --> 00:25:13,012
That lecture plan.

427
00:25:14,082 --> 00:25:16,282
Did Ms. Seo approve it?

428
00:25:16,421 --> 00:25:18,352
I don't know.

429
00:25:20,852 --> 00:25:22,861
The Seo Hye Jin I know...

430
00:25:23,592 --> 00:25:25,661
wouldn't have let him get away with it.

431
00:25:35,302 --> 00:25:37,042
I didn't show it to Ms. Seo.

432
00:25:37,671 --> 00:25:40,012
I typed it up myself.

433
00:25:43,441 --> 00:25:45,312
I'll talk to the director when I come in.

434
00:25:45,312 --> 00:25:47,582
She didn't say it was an outright no.

435
00:25:47,582 --> 00:25:50,151
She just meant it was not the right time.

436
00:25:50,421 --> 00:25:53,492
You should do as the superiors say.

437
00:25:54,522 --> 00:25:56,492
Don't take them on...

438
00:25:56,492 --> 00:25:58,292
and get on their bad side.

439
00:25:59,292 --> 00:26:00,332
I'm not disappointed.

440
00:26:00,631 --> 00:26:02,062
I knew they wouldn't approve right away.

441
00:26:03,262 --> 00:26:04,262
Yes.

442
00:26:09,141 --> 00:26:11,002
Yes, I know you tried.

443
00:26:11,572 --> 00:26:12,842
No.

444
00:26:13,171 --> 00:26:15,342
See you in the evening. Bye.

445
00:26:22,721 --> 00:26:23,782
You startled me.

446
00:26:24,522 --> 00:26:26,852
- Why? - I thought you'd disappeared.

447
00:26:30,361 --> 00:26:31,461
We should get back.

448
00:26:40,131 --> 00:26:41,131
Seo Hye Jin.

449
00:26:47,242 --> 00:26:48,242
What was that for?

450
00:26:48,871 --> 00:26:51,211
It would feel just like a work thing if I didn't take a photo.

451
00:26:54,012 --> 00:26:55,052
You're right.

452
00:26:55,352 --> 00:26:56,982
Can I keep it as a souvenir of our first trip...

453
00:26:56,982 --> 00:26:58,082
as a couple?

454
00:27:01,852 --> 00:27:04,522
I thought you would correct it for me.

455
00:27:07,562 --> 00:27:09,602
It wasn't homework or an essay,

456
00:27:10,262 --> 00:27:13,131
so it didn't need any correcting.

457
00:27:14,032 --> 00:27:15,032
Okay.

458
00:27:15,371 --> 00:27:16,401
Instead,

459
00:27:18,441 --> 00:27:21,611
I wrote a few comments at the end of each book report.

460
00:27:23,141 --> 00:27:24,211
What?

461
00:27:24,312 --> 00:27:27,252
Your goal is to score well in exams.

462
00:27:29,322 --> 00:27:32,852
Modern novels and poems, classical novels and old prose.

463
00:27:33,792 --> 00:27:37,621
How you should approach and read passages from those genres.

464
00:27:38,361 --> 00:27:41,161
How I would read them if I were you.

465
00:27:42,961 --> 00:27:44,532
I wrote things like that.

466
00:27:46,502 --> 00:27:48,602
Read it later. Not here.

467
00:27:50,141 --> 00:27:51,141
Okay.

468
00:27:55,881 --> 00:27:56,941
Mr. Pyo.

469
00:27:58,782 --> 00:28:01,282
I gave this to you yesterday.

470
00:28:01,282 --> 00:28:02,411
When did you write all that?

471
00:28:04,522 --> 00:28:05,522
I stayed up all night.

472
00:28:07,221 --> 00:28:08,421
Thank you.

473
00:28:09,421 --> 00:28:12,121
It was fun, though.

474
00:28:14,461 --> 00:28:16,262
You can go now. I'm busy.

475
00:28:32,411 --> 00:28:33,852
I'll take back the offer.

476
00:28:36,421 --> 00:28:37,482
What a shame.

477
00:28:39,391 --> 00:28:41,052
What will you do now?

478
00:28:41,522 --> 00:28:44,161
You waited for your time for 8 years and 7 months.

479
00:28:45,062 --> 00:28:47,891
Will you bide your time for a few more months?

480
00:28:47,891 --> 00:28:49,532
I'm switching around the order.

481
00:28:50,701 --> 00:28:53,102
Instead of taking down Seo Hye Jin and moving out,

482
00:28:54,002 --> 00:28:56,272
I'll move and take her down from the outside.

483
00:28:57,201 --> 00:29:00,272
Korean instructors Lee Myeong Jun, Nam Cheong Mi, and Kim Chae Yun.

484
00:29:00,641 --> 00:29:02,742
English instructors Yoon Ji Seok, Jang Il Do,

485
00:29:02,742 --> 00:29:04,941
Cheon Yi Chang, Kang Gi Ho, and Lee Geum Yang.

486
00:29:05,282 --> 00:29:06,752
Social studies instructor Min Hui Ju.

487
00:29:07,681 --> 00:29:11,221
Korean instructor Lee Jun Ho would be worth mentioning too,

488
00:29:11,221 --> 00:29:12,421
but he's...

489
00:29:13,691 --> 00:29:15,621
so loyal to Ms. Seo, so I'll skip him.

490
00:29:16,562 --> 00:29:17,661
Did I guess correctly?

491
00:29:17,961 --> 00:29:20,562
The people you want to set sail within your ark.

492
00:29:26,532 --> 00:29:28,201
The material you have.

493
00:29:28,502 --> 00:29:31,542
Will it go to Nam Cheong Mi or Kim Chae Yun?

494
00:29:31,671 --> 00:29:32,971
Didn't I tell you?

495
00:29:33,542 --> 00:29:36,312
In the long term, we're competitors too.

496
00:29:37,141 --> 00:29:38,941
I can't tell you all that.

497
00:29:39,211 --> 00:29:41,752
Don't think of me as a competitor.

498
00:29:42,052 --> 00:29:45,651
Try to use Choi Hyung Sun to better yourself.

499
00:29:46,721 --> 00:29:50,621
If you bring those instructors and join my academy,

500
00:29:51,292 --> 00:29:53,391
I think there would be a lot I could do for you.

501
00:29:54,431 --> 00:29:55,792
But Choisun is a Korean only academy.

502
00:29:57,302 --> 00:30:00,332
What would you do with English and social studies instructors?

503
00:30:01,002 --> 00:30:02,572
I'll take them all in.

504
00:30:02,971 --> 00:30:05,502
And create an academy that teaches multiple subjects.

505
00:30:09,141 --> 00:30:12,512
Before you make the decision,

506
00:30:13,082 --> 00:30:15,752
how about you invite one more person onto your ship?

507
00:30:18,282 --> 00:30:20,921
Are you talking about Seo Hye Jin?

508
00:30:22,792 --> 00:30:25,992
I haven't completely given up on her.

509
00:30:27,191 --> 00:30:29,832
Your goal is to separate...

510
00:30:29,832 --> 00:30:32,701
Seo Hye Jin and Kim Hyun Tak.

511
00:30:33,431 --> 00:30:34,602
Isn't it a good deal?

512
00:30:46,451 --> 00:30:47,451
What is it?

513
00:30:48,312 --> 00:30:49,552
Something came up.

514
00:30:50,752 --> 00:30:53,221
I need you to do something while I'm away.

515
00:30:53,792 --> 00:30:54,822
It's an assignment.

516
00:30:55,451 --> 00:30:57,221
Take me home...

517
00:30:57,992 --> 00:31:00,292
and head to your parents' for the night.

518
00:31:01,992 --> 00:31:03,002
No.

519
00:31:03,161 --> 00:31:04,901
It's an assignment which you must do.

520
00:31:06,201 --> 00:31:07,332
Why must I do it?

521
00:31:08,272 --> 00:31:10,502
Tell your parents about your idea...

522
00:31:10,502 --> 00:31:12,302
in the nicest way...

523
00:31:12,302 --> 00:31:13,772
and appease their anger.

524
00:31:16,582 --> 00:31:17,711
I'll do that in my own way.

525
00:31:19,082 --> 00:31:20,151
I want...

526
00:31:21,252 --> 00:31:24,052
my boyfriend to be a nice person.

527
00:31:25,381 --> 00:31:27,092
Tall, handsome, and rich.

528
00:31:27,092 --> 00:31:28,191
That qualifies as nice.

529
00:31:28,691 --> 00:31:29,891
Didn't you say...

530
00:31:30,191 --> 00:31:31,961
you wanted to teach the kids...

531
00:31:31,961 --> 00:31:34,161
how to properly read and interpret writings?

532
00:31:34,562 --> 00:31:36,262
What does that have to do with being a good boyfriend?

533
00:31:36,961 --> 00:31:38,431
A money-grubbing rebellious son...

534
00:31:38,431 --> 00:31:39,901
teaching the profound topics of literature...

535
00:31:39,901 --> 00:31:42,171
and the writer's intent and views?

536
00:31:42,171 --> 00:31:43,371
That's hilarious.

537
00:31:48,242 --> 00:31:49,342
You'll do the assignment, right?

538
00:31:52,812 --> 00:31:53,852
Unbelievable.

539
00:31:56,822 --> 00:31:58,052
Why did it have to be you?

540
00:31:59,052 --> 00:32:00,092
It as in my girlfriend.

541
00:32:33,121 --> 00:32:34,121
Come in.

542
00:32:41,232 --> 00:32:43,332
Gosh, come on in, Hye Jin.

543
00:32:43,562 --> 00:32:46,062
- Did I make you wait? - No, I just got here.

544
00:32:46,832 --> 00:32:48,602
I'm sorry I made you take the long trip.

545
00:32:49,002 --> 00:32:50,072
I bet you met heavy traffic.

546
00:32:50,441 --> 00:32:52,401
I thought I might, so I took the subway.

547
00:32:53,171 --> 00:32:55,072
Of course. Always so astute.

548
00:32:55,471 --> 00:32:56,681
- Let us sit. - Sure.

549
00:33:00,951 --> 00:33:04,082
I said we'd take our time ordering. Is that all right?

550
00:33:04,082 --> 00:33:05,381
- Of course. - Good.

551
00:33:10,092 --> 00:33:12,062
I should make occasions like this often,

552
00:33:12,062 --> 00:33:13,792
but it's never easy.

553
00:33:13,792 --> 00:33:15,861
The instructors are always busy,

554
00:33:16,332 --> 00:33:18,062
and you are each other's competition.

555
00:33:18,861 --> 00:33:21,171
You can never grab a few drinks easily...

556
00:33:21,171 --> 00:33:22,502
without people suspecting favoritism.

557
00:33:22,772 --> 00:33:25,572
You all get easily jealous as well.

558
00:33:26,711 --> 00:33:28,611
That's why I was surprised by this invitation.

559
00:33:34,012 --> 00:33:37,451
Having you meet me at a place far away from the academy...

560
00:33:37,451 --> 00:33:38,822
probably made it more suspicious.

561
00:33:41,052 --> 00:33:42,092
Well,

562
00:33:42,492 --> 00:33:44,891
you must have weighed the options before coming here,

563
00:33:45,562 --> 00:33:46,861
so I'll cut to the chase.

564
00:33:47,562 --> 00:33:48,562
Sure.

565
00:33:49,961 --> 00:33:51,931
I'm preparing for retirement.

566
00:33:55,802 --> 00:33:58,441
I thought you'd be around for at least another decade.

567
00:34:00,272 --> 00:34:01,572
As if.

568
00:34:03,012 --> 00:34:04,381
Back in the day,

569
00:34:04,381 --> 00:34:06,352
I used to memorize the names of all the students,

570
00:34:06,352 --> 00:34:07,512
but it's now impossible.

571
00:34:08,512 --> 00:34:10,822
And it's not like I've been teaching students...

572
00:34:11,852 --> 00:34:12,951
throughout my career...

573
00:34:13,792 --> 00:34:15,721
like Choi Hyung Sun.

574
00:34:17,022 --> 00:34:18,621
Does Director Kim know about this?

575
00:34:19,062 --> 00:34:20,062
Not yet.

576
00:34:21,491 --> 00:34:22,661
But funnily enough,

577
00:34:26,632 --> 00:34:28,172
I received my pension in advance.

578
00:34:30,641 --> 00:34:31,871
I don't follow.

579
00:34:39,882 --> 00:34:40,911
What's that?

580
00:34:41,612 --> 00:34:43,882
It contains all of your teaching materials...

581
00:34:45,221 --> 00:34:46,652
including your pop quizzes.

582
00:35:03,341 --> 00:35:06,141
Who would...

583
00:35:07,141 --> 00:35:09,511
- And how... - As if that's the issue.

584
00:35:09,511 --> 00:35:12,281
What's important is that the flash drive is in my hands.

585
00:35:13,181 --> 00:35:14,252
Take it with you.

586
00:35:14,812 --> 00:35:17,152
You'll need to verify my words.

587
00:35:18,482 --> 00:35:21,152
You're not even hiding the fact that you made a copy.

588
00:35:21,491 --> 00:35:23,091
Like a copy would be the only thing I have.

589
00:35:24,292 --> 00:35:25,862
You must have something more.

590
00:35:27,031 --> 00:35:28,332
You don't...

591
00:35:29,531 --> 00:35:31,602
seem that startled to know I have that flash drive.

592
00:35:33,031 --> 00:35:34,371
Were you aware of this?

593
00:35:38,772 --> 00:35:40,371
Who could have told you?

594
00:35:42,112 --> 00:35:43,382
As if that's important right now.

595
00:35:46,882 --> 00:35:47,882
It's not.

596
00:35:49,011 --> 00:35:50,082
The only suspects are...

597
00:35:50,352 --> 00:35:52,352
the one who gave me the teaching material...

598
00:35:52,652 --> 00:35:54,991
and the one who desperately wanted it.

599
00:35:54,991 --> 00:35:55,991
Just those two.

600
00:35:56,621 --> 00:35:58,761
But what's important is that none of the two will get it.

601
00:35:59,792 --> 00:36:00,832
Then,

602
00:36:01,431 --> 00:36:04,301
let's think of the best way to utilize the learning material..

603
00:36:04,301 --> 00:36:06,332
you shed blood, sweat, and tears...

604
00:36:07,531 --> 00:36:08,531
to compile.

605
00:36:24,082 --> 00:36:25,152
I guess...

606
00:36:27,652 --> 00:36:30,062
I should follow you and jump academies.

607
00:36:30,761 --> 00:36:32,661
If I don't, the material...

608
00:36:34,062 --> 00:36:35,862
will fall into someone else's lap.

609
00:36:39,031 --> 00:36:40,071
Let's eat.

610
00:36:40,471 --> 00:36:42,772
I only had a light lunch, and now I'm starving.

611
00:36:44,772 --> 00:36:46,272
I would appreciate your respect on the matter.

612
00:36:47,741 --> 00:36:48,812
Sure.

613
00:36:51,542 --> 00:36:52,542
I thought...

614
00:36:53,281 --> 00:36:55,382
you'd have other things to say.

615
00:36:55,752 --> 00:36:57,051
You said it boiled down...

616
00:36:57,252 --> 00:36:59,281
to your conscience and responsibility as an educator.

617
00:37:00,491 --> 00:37:02,252
How could I dare question that?

618
00:37:03,661 --> 00:37:05,391
It may be upsetting to hear,

619
00:37:05,692 --> 00:37:07,062
but I should respect your decision.

620
00:37:09,161 --> 00:37:11,102
Right. Thank you.

621
00:37:12,661 --> 00:37:14,031
You're free to leave.

622
00:37:14,531 --> 00:37:16,701
You must be busy preparing for your free lecture.

623
00:37:46,431 --> 00:37:47,772
If I were Kim Hyun Tak,

624
00:37:48,371 --> 00:37:50,442
I wouldn't treat you the way he does.

625
00:37:51,301 --> 00:37:53,071
He was able to take over my academy...

626
00:37:53,672 --> 00:37:57,542
and take home a salary while strolling around doing nothing...

627
00:37:57,542 --> 00:37:58,982
all thanks to a certain someone.

628
00:38:00,612 --> 00:38:03,422
I still see him as my savior.

629
00:38:03,821 --> 00:38:05,652
Stabbing him in the back...

630
00:38:05,951 --> 00:38:07,091
Poor you.

631
00:38:07,591 --> 00:38:09,352
Have you forgotten who first did the stabbing?

632
00:38:10,661 --> 00:38:13,062
You've seen how he tried to divide your Chanyoung High classes.

633
00:38:15,091 --> 00:38:16,502
Yes, that incident...

634
00:38:18,632 --> 00:38:19,732
was upsetting.

635
00:38:27,241 --> 00:38:29,011
I'll need some time to think.

636
00:38:29,011 --> 00:38:30,741
Of course you do.

637
00:38:32,511 --> 00:38:34,411
Have you decided who to take with you?

638
00:38:36,082 --> 00:38:37,551
That?

639
00:38:37,922 --> 00:38:41,091
I can only let you in on that once you agree in writing.

640
00:38:42,792 --> 00:38:44,661
Is Lee Jun Ho on the list?

641
00:38:45,692 --> 00:38:46,832
He can be if you want.

642
00:38:48,292 --> 00:38:50,062
There's something I'd like to test first.

643
00:38:51,531 --> 00:38:54,132
Mr. Lee proposed a lecture he'd like to open.

644
00:38:54,871 --> 00:38:57,002
I was notified of it, and it was declined.

645
00:38:57,402 --> 00:38:59,841
How about we let him go ahead with it?

646
00:39:00,471 --> 00:39:01,471
For what reason?

647
00:39:01,942 --> 00:39:04,212
To see if he's worth bringing with us.

648
00:39:04,582 --> 00:39:06,812
He's an instructor with fresh views,

649
00:39:07,482 --> 00:39:09,411
but he's not easy...

650
00:39:10,621 --> 00:39:11,922
to control.

651
00:39:15,991 --> 00:39:17,522
Not only are you a bad actor,

652
00:39:17,522 --> 00:39:19,261
but you're a terrible liar as well.

653
00:39:20,562 --> 00:39:23,201
Everyone knows of the special bond you have as teacher and student.

654
00:39:24,062 --> 00:39:26,531
Gosh. Hasn't the rumor spread?

655
00:39:27,902 --> 00:39:29,571
Mr. Lee and I...

656
00:39:31,442 --> 00:39:32,741
bit each other's heads off.

657
00:39:34,672 --> 00:39:37,042
That job is one everyone wants a piece of,

658
00:39:37,681 --> 00:39:39,781
so how does it make sense to turn the offer down?

659
00:39:41,681 --> 00:39:43,721
Tell us why. You're good with words, aren't you?

660
00:39:46,792 --> 00:39:48,091
You may not know this, but...

661
00:39:48,792 --> 00:39:49,891
What don't I know?

662
00:39:50,621 --> 00:39:52,862
Let him talk, will you?

663
00:39:53,391 --> 00:39:54,862
He's trying to tell us something.

664
00:39:58,002 --> 00:39:59,332
I respect you both.

665
00:40:01,201 --> 00:40:03,801
No one told you to respect us.

666
00:40:04,272 --> 00:40:06,002
Just do as we say.

667
00:40:06,002 --> 00:40:07,312
When I quit my last job,

668
00:40:08,011 --> 00:40:09,841
I said many hurtful things to you.

669
00:40:11,082 --> 00:40:13,482
But I'm not undermining the life you have led.

670
00:40:14,781 --> 00:40:17,681
Other than raising your three boys,

671
00:40:17,681 --> 00:40:19,252
you focused on nothing else.

672
00:40:20,391 --> 00:40:21,422
You know that, but...

673
00:40:21,891 --> 00:40:24,261
Why can't you understand...

674
00:40:25,022 --> 00:40:26,422
that I don't want to live my life thinking about...

675
00:40:26,422 --> 00:40:28,232
what I can take more from you...

676
00:40:29,591 --> 00:40:31,931
to make my life easier?

677
00:40:33,471 --> 00:40:34,531
It's upsetting.

678
00:40:37,571 --> 00:40:38,701
Just this once.

679
00:40:39,871 --> 00:40:41,272
Please put your faith in me and see how I do.

680
00:40:43,781 --> 00:40:45,312
I only ask because I love and respect you.

681
00:40:48,511 --> 00:40:49,551
All right.

682
00:40:50,482 --> 00:40:52,221
Snap out of it! How can you be good with it?

683
00:40:53,321 --> 00:40:55,091
He just said we upset him.

684
00:41:01,491 --> 00:41:03,602
Mom, are you crying?

685
00:41:05,761 --> 00:41:07,201
Yes, she gave it to me.

686
00:41:08,201 --> 00:41:11,002
Well, I was able to figure out a few things.

687
00:41:11,301 --> 00:41:13,812
The files were copied in bulk quite recently.

688
00:41:14,141 --> 00:41:16,141
I can also tell just about when.

689
00:41:17,281 --> 00:41:19,442
If I publicized it to find out who did this,

690
00:41:20,411 --> 00:41:21,681
I could find out who did it.

691
00:41:23,922 --> 00:41:24,922
But I won't.

692
00:41:25,852 --> 00:41:26,891
Why not?

693
00:41:27,352 --> 00:41:29,522
It will only lead me to Ms. Woo's inside man,

694
00:41:29,522 --> 00:41:30,962
and what good would that do?

695
00:41:31,121 --> 00:41:32,462
Getting what I want...

696
00:41:32,462 --> 00:41:34,132
and rendering these files useless is more important.

697
00:41:35,632 --> 00:41:36,661
That being said,

698
00:41:37,261 --> 00:41:40,701
we'll need to remain on the outs at the academy.

699
00:41:41,201 --> 00:41:43,002
Officially, we're a superior and subordinate...

700
00:41:43,002 --> 00:41:45,272
who are still upset with one another.

701
00:41:45,801 --> 00:41:47,241
- I'm putting my trust in you. - Sure.

702
00:41:47,241 --> 00:41:48,871
Please make sure they come out nicely. Thanks.

703
00:41:48,871 --> 00:41:49,871
Sure thing.

704
00:41:50,281 --> 00:41:51,411
Let's go.

705
00:41:51,411 --> 00:41:53,681
(Ness Printing)

706
00:41:54,011 --> 00:41:55,482
Can we now grab a bite to eat?

707
00:41:55,852 --> 00:41:57,422
What? Actually, we have one more place to go...

708
00:41:57,422 --> 00:41:58,882
to place orders for a promotional item.

709
00:42:00,352 --> 00:42:01,422
Are you hungry?

710
00:42:01,422 --> 00:42:02,721
No, I'm good.

711
00:42:03,862 --> 00:42:05,062
A promotional item, did you say?

712
00:42:06,062 --> 00:42:08,062
A ball-point pen with my name printed on it.

713
00:42:08,732 --> 00:42:09,832
It's for the students.

714
00:42:10,962 --> 00:42:13,161
Gosh. Do you prepare those yourself?

715
00:42:13,701 --> 00:42:16,971
I can hire someone to do the work, but that'll cost me more.

716
00:42:17,542 --> 00:42:19,272
I'm saving money by doing the heavy lifting.

717
00:42:20,511 --> 00:42:21,542
You're a smart cookie.

718
00:42:22,141 --> 00:42:23,411
I get that a lot.

719
00:42:26,181 --> 00:42:27,181
What?

720
00:42:28,181 --> 00:42:29,212
My gosh!

721
00:42:33,951 --> 00:42:34,951
Gosh.

722
00:42:35,352 --> 00:42:36,352
- Behind you. - Right.

723
00:42:37,721 --> 00:42:38,891
Did you see me just now?

724
00:42:39,962 --> 00:42:42,531
What? Yes, I did.

725
00:42:43,502 --> 00:42:44,531
Thanks for that.

726
00:42:46,402 --> 00:42:47,871
I should be complimented for that.

727
00:42:49,301 --> 00:42:50,471
Wasn't I cool just now?

728
00:42:53,071 --> 00:42:54,212
You were all right.

729
00:42:56,341 --> 00:42:57,712
I bet I scored a lot of points.

730
00:42:58,942 --> 00:43:00,411
I must've scored more points...

731
00:43:00,951 --> 00:43:02,681
than I did trying to sweet-talk you.

732
00:43:06,051 --> 00:43:07,091
To be honest...

733
00:43:10,522 --> 00:43:11,522
We'll keep...

734
00:43:12,562 --> 00:43:13,962
seeing each other, right?

735
00:43:17,732 --> 00:43:18,732
Sure.

736
00:43:22,371 --> 00:43:23,641
I'm dying to find out...

737
00:43:24,641 --> 00:43:26,002
when we'll officially date.

738
00:43:28,871 --> 00:43:29,871
Today.

739
00:43:35,852 --> 00:43:37,082
Why are you free today?

740
00:43:37,451 --> 00:43:38,982
I thought graduate students were busier.

741
00:43:41,221 --> 00:43:44,321
And here I thought this was our first day as a couple.

742
00:43:46,022 --> 00:43:47,232
The university is on break.

743
00:43:47,591 --> 00:43:48,761
There's no harm in kicking back a little.

744
00:43:53,801 --> 00:43:55,332
That alley seemed dangerous though.

745
00:43:56,971 --> 00:43:58,102
Whether it be me or not,

746
00:43:59,071 --> 00:44:00,312
make sure you always have company.

747
00:44:03,141 --> 00:44:05,141
It's not like I go there often.

748
00:44:07,752 --> 00:44:10,422
By the way, did Jun Ho complete his textbook?

749
00:44:11,582 --> 00:44:13,321
His textbook seemed different.

750
00:44:21,632 --> 00:44:22,632
Watch.

751
00:44:25,301 --> 00:44:26,332
This is Ms. Seo.

752
00:44:27,672 --> 00:44:28,832
This is Mr. Lee.

753
00:44:30,602 --> 00:44:32,542
Clash!

754
00:44:33,241 --> 00:44:34,272
They went head to head.

755
00:44:34,542 --> 00:44:35,542
No way.

756
00:44:37,181 --> 00:44:38,841
I couldn't care less about who won.

757
00:44:42,382 --> 00:44:44,022
I'm pretty sure it was Jun Ho.

758
00:44:45,082 --> 00:44:47,491
No one can stop him when he sets his mind on something.

759
00:44:48,922 --> 00:44:50,862
- We'll go after work, then. - Sure.

760
00:44:51,161 --> 00:44:52,161
Sounds good.

761
00:44:54,632 --> 00:44:56,632
Hi, everyone.

762
00:44:59,931 --> 00:45:01,002
Hi, Ms. Kim.

763
00:45:05,772 --> 00:45:10,482
(Wednesday morning, Lobby, 1st floor, small lecture room 2)

764
00:45:10,681 --> 00:45:13,141
Ms. Woo changed her mind.

765
00:45:16,712 --> 00:45:17,752
Thank you.

766
00:45:18,551 --> 00:45:20,721
You should've come up with this sooner.

767
00:45:21,091 --> 00:45:22,792
You're at a disadvantage...

768
00:45:22,792 --> 00:45:24,792
since most students have already filled out their schedules.

769
00:45:24,991 --> 00:45:27,132
That's why I said I'd start small.

770
00:45:27,491 --> 00:45:28,761
If I had come to you sooner,

771
00:45:29,062 --> 00:45:30,232
I would've asked for a lecture hall instead.

772
00:45:32,301 --> 00:45:33,602
I like how confident you are.

773
00:45:35,002 --> 00:45:36,132
- Have a good day, then. - Thanks.

774
00:45:36,132 --> 00:45:37,141
Sure.

775
00:45:38,741 --> 00:45:39,971
- Hi. - You're here.

776
00:45:40,471 --> 00:45:43,172
Ms. Kim, what brings you to our team?

777
00:45:43,172 --> 00:45:46,442
Oh, that? I had something for Mr. Lee.

778
00:45:46,712 --> 00:45:47,752
I see.

779
00:45:51,582 --> 00:45:53,752
Have a good day, everyone.

780
00:45:56,792 --> 00:45:57,821
Going up.

781
00:46:01,462 --> 00:46:02,531
Just a second!

782
00:46:05,431 --> 00:46:06,462
Thanks.

783
00:46:29,491 --> 00:46:31,491
(Consultation room 2)

784
00:46:34,832 --> 00:46:35,862
Welcome.

785
00:46:42,801 --> 00:46:43,971
Won't people say...

786
00:46:44,301 --> 00:46:45,841
we're giving Mr. Lee special treatment?

787
00:46:46,172 --> 00:46:47,312
(Daechi Chase)

788
00:46:47,312 --> 00:46:49,442
He's a student of mine that I adore,

789
00:46:50,042 --> 00:46:52,442
so I want nothing more than to do him favors.

790
00:46:54,011 --> 00:46:55,181
But why did it have to be during school break?

791
00:46:55,652 --> 00:46:57,352
I believe it's quite promising.

792
00:46:57,752 --> 00:47:00,721
Ms. Kim went over his proposal and deemed it practical.

793
00:47:02,951 --> 00:47:05,991
You never know which classes will be your money-maker.

794
00:47:07,531 --> 00:47:08,661
I hope it works out.

795
00:47:09,891 --> 00:47:10,902
Then...

796
00:47:15,172 --> 00:47:16,172
(Lecture Plan)

797
00:47:16,732 --> 00:47:17,871
Read it through.

798
00:47:18,542 --> 00:47:20,442
You said our free lecture was the best you ever had.

799
00:47:33,821 --> 00:47:34,891
Will this...

800
00:47:35,852 --> 00:47:36,891
get rid...

801
00:47:37,422 --> 00:47:39,591
of the anxiety I have before tests?

802
00:47:40,062 --> 00:47:41,362
You're the one who studies.

803
00:47:42,091 --> 00:47:44,402
All I do is teach in a way that I deem as effective.

804
00:47:47,701 --> 00:47:50,071
Take it with you and think about it.

805
00:47:52,002 --> 00:47:53,812
Actually, I'll sign up right away.

806
00:47:55,672 --> 00:47:58,181
Mr. Pyo is really quitting his job...

807
00:47:58,781 --> 00:47:59,911
at the school.

808
00:48:02,312 --> 00:48:03,451
But...

809
00:48:04,252 --> 00:48:05,951
I don't intend to switch academies.

810
00:48:07,091 --> 00:48:10,252
Why are you suggesting that I take another class?

811
00:48:13,062 --> 00:48:16,161
I've always completed my assignments on time...

812
00:48:16,661 --> 00:48:18,031
and have good grades.

813
00:48:18,902 --> 00:48:20,602
My mom also likes your classes.

814
00:48:20,602 --> 00:48:21,672
That's why.

815
00:48:23,332 --> 00:48:25,371
Ha Yul, you've taken my classes since the very beginning...

816
00:48:25,502 --> 00:48:27,042
after your mom did extensive research.

817
00:48:28,371 --> 00:48:29,371
Yes.

818
00:48:29,371 --> 00:48:30,841
But I believe...

819
00:48:30,841 --> 00:48:35,082
that you are someone who can think for herself...

820
00:48:35,082 --> 00:48:36,612
and make her own decisions.

821
00:48:37,882 --> 00:48:38,951
Am I?

822
00:48:40,121 --> 00:48:42,051
I've never heard anyone say that about me.

823
00:48:42,221 --> 00:48:44,091
You seem docile,

824
00:48:44,091 --> 00:48:46,121
but you don't let others sway you.

825
00:48:46,792 --> 00:48:48,591
Also, you find what works best for you.

826
00:48:49,591 --> 00:48:51,062
That's the person I see.

827
00:48:52,562 --> 00:48:53,732
Thank you.

828
00:48:54,931 --> 00:48:56,502
It's really a first.

829
00:48:56,602 --> 00:48:59,902
So I thought you could try other classes...

830
00:49:00,511 --> 00:49:02,141
and make decisions for yourself.

831
00:49:02,341 --> 00:49:03,942
That kind of experience might be good for you.

832
00:49:04,942 --> 00:49:06,141
If you're worried,

833
00:49:06,141 --> 00:49:07,152
take the class with Jung Soo and Ye Eun.

834
00:49:10,112 --> 00:49:12,022
Would you like to check out Mr. Pyo's free lecture?

835
00:49:14,321 --> 00:49:15,721
I won't force you if you don't want to.

836
00:49:17,862 --> 00:49:20,022
It's fine. I'll check it out.

(Choisun Academy's Pyo Sang Seob, Free Lecture)

840
00:49:53,991 --> 00:49:55,391
Hey, it's Ms. Seo.

841
00:49:57,562 --> 00:49:59,701
- I know. - Will we get on her bad side?

842
00:50:00,332 --> 00:50:01,801
Ms. Seo isn't the type to hold grudges.

Nice to meet you.

00:51:50,442 --> 00:51:54,181
I am the symbol of First Class. My name is Pyo Sang Seob.

849
00:51:56,652 --> 00:51:58,051
My lecture will last 1 hour and 30 minutes.

850
00:51:58,821 --> 00:52:02,221
And it's about the trend of contemporary Korean literature.

851
00:52:02,652 --> 00:52:06,161
I know this is a free lecture, but I will make it my mission...

852
00:52:07,062 --> 00:52:10,701
that you never forget what you learn today.

853
00:52:23,841 --> 00:52:25,042
When my students are late,

854
00:52:25,712 --> 00:52:27,882
it's my rule to have them stand in the back of my class.

855
00:52:28,681 --> 00:52:31,152
But it's my first class. So let's cut her some slack.

856
00:52:32,252 --> 00:52:33,252
Are you guys okay with that?

857
00:52:33,252 --> 00:52:34,451
- Yes. - Yes.

Father went to the market on a donkey

861
00:52:48,672 --> 00:52:54,772
Grandmother went to a man's house in a nearby village

862
00:52:55,712 --> 00:53:02,212
I ate the chili pepper and gasped, I ate the wild chives and gasped

863
00:53:03,281 --> 00:53:06,752
Grandmother got the birthday rice cakes

864
00:53:06,882 --> 00:53:09,591
And carried them on her head

865
00:53:10,221 --> 00:53:13,692
Until she arrived home after walking the winding path

866
00:53:13,692 --> 00:53:16,362

867
00:53:17,161 --> 00:53:23,832
I ate the chili pepper and gasped, I ate the wild chives and gasped

868
00:53:29,741 --> 00:53:31,341
Who knows the original title of the song?

869
00:53:38,181 --> 00:53:41,192
The original title of the song is "The Baby at Home."

870
00:53:42,522 --> 00:53:44,522
It was released in the 1920s.

871
00:53:45,362 --> 00:53:47,161
It was actually a song...

872
00:53:47,161 --> 00:53:49,362
that was passed down orally from one region to another.

873
00:53:50,091 --> 00:53:51,931
You must pay attention to "wild chives" in the lyrics.

874
00:53:52,402 --> 00:53:54,672
The wild chives here don't mean the vegetable we're used to.

875
00:53:56,132 --> 00:53:57,841
They actually meant cigarettes.

876
00:54:03,011 --> 00:54:04,582
You can look it up on the Internet later.

877
00:54:05,382 --> 00:54:07,451
What you need to do now is to visualize it.

878
00:54:08,382 --> 00:54:09,411
All right.

879
00:54:11,422 --> 00:54:12,652
Let's picture the scene now.

880
00:54:14,391 --> 00:54:16,852
The adults left the house to run errands of their own.

881
00:54:17,391 --> 00:54:19,462
It's an unthinkable thing now.

882
00:54:19,692 --> 00:54:21,761
But the child is all alone at home.

883
00:54:22,891 --> 00:54:25,062
There's no TV or cell phone.

884
00:54:25,531 --> 00:54:27,471
Children's books or toys don't exist in this era either.

885
00:54:28,071 --> 00:54:29,732
The child is bored out of his mind.

886
00:54:29,971 --> 00:54:33,272
He must do his best to find something fun to do. All right.

887
00:54:35,312 --> 00:54:38,212
Then he sees chili peppers spread out around the house...

888
00:54:39,542 --> 00:54:40,911
and a bunch of smoking pipes.

889
00:54:42,681 --> 00:54:44,482
The child starts to mimic grown-ups.

890
00:54:45,221 --> 00:54:46,422
He eats the chili peppers.

891
00:54:48,391 --> 00:54:49,591
Then he smokes with the pipe.

892
00:54:54,931 --> 00:54:56,931
His senses are utterly stimulated that he can't think straight.

893
00:54:58,261 --> 00:55:00,502
They taste spicy and bitter that he can't stand still.

894
00:55:00,502 --> 00:55:02,232
So he circles around the same spot.

895
00:55:02,531 --> 00:55:04,371
While gasping.

896
00:55:05,201 --> 00:55:08,141
After having the chili peppers... "Gosh, it's spicy!"

897
00:55:08,612 --> 00:55:10,911
After having the wild chives... "Spicy!"

898
00:55:10,911 --> 00:55:13,082
He gasps at the spiciness.

899
00:55:13,082 --> 00:55:17,252
I ate the chili pepper and gasped, I ate the wild chives and gasped

900
00:55:22,422 --> 00:55:23,422
What do you think?

901
00:55:24,761 --> 00:55:26,821
You didn't think much of the chorus up until now.

902
00:55:26,821 --> 00:55:27,962
But it's beginning to look like a vivid picture.

903
00:55:27,962 --> 00:55:28,962
Don't you agree?

904
00:55:29,292 --> 00:55:30,491
- Yes. - Yes.

905
00:55:31,402 --> 00:55:32,761
The writers of the national textbooks...

906
00:55:33,661 --> 00:55:35,602
switched out cigarettes with wild chives...

907
00:55:35,602 --> 00:55:37,071
to make it suitable for students. Can you understand their intention?

908
00:55:37,272 --> 00:55:38,471
- Yes. - Yes.

909
00:55:38,801 --> 00:55:39,801
All right.

910
00:55:40,971 --> 00:55:42,071
I said...

911
00:55:43,042 --> 00:55:44,681
we were going to study the trend of Korean literature.

912
00:55:47,882 --> 00:55:48,911
See if you can answer this.

913
00:55:49,781 --> 00:55:52,281
What's the basis of "literature" then?

914
00:55:52,621 --> 00:55:55,252
- Life and death. - Life and death?

915
00:55:56,022 --> 00:55:57,692
Then I'll choose life.

916
00:55:59,721 --> 00:56:00,832
- Me? - Yes.

917
00:56:01,132 --> 00:56:02,292
Just tell me what comes to your mind.

918
00:56:03,462 --> 00:56:04,531
History?

919
00:56:04,862 --> 00:56:05,902
History?

920
00:56:09,772 --> 00:56:11,701
(History)

921
00:56:12,241 --> 00:56:14,002
- Do you mean this? - Yes.

922
00:56:15,112 --> 00:56:16,341
Do you guys agree?

923
00:56:17,042 --> 00:56:18,181
- Yes. - Yes.

924
00:56:18,841 --> 00:56:19,911
Great.

925
00:56:22,752 --> 00:56:24,152
Japan's annexation of Korea in 1910.

926
00:56:24,152 --> 00:56:25,752
"Mujong" by Yi Gwang Su in 1917.

927
00:56:25,752 --> 00:56:27,121
The 1st publication of Taeseo Literary Journal in 1918.

928
00:56:27,121 --> 00:56:28,252
The 1st publication of the magazine, Gaebyeok, in 1920.

929
00:56:28,252 --> 00:56:30,022
The New Literary Movement in 1930 and so on.

930
00:56:31,292 --> 00:56:33,292
You guys spent way too much time to memorize all these facts.

931
00:56:33,821 --> 00:56:35,562
So naturally, you would think it would be history. But...

932
00:56:39,761 --> 00:56:41,031
that's wrong.

933
00:56:50,212 --> 00:56:51,281
(Trend of literature)

934
00:56:51,281 --> 00:56:52,312
"Trend of literature."

935
00:56:54,911 --> 00:56:55,951
It won't be on the exam.

936
00:56:56,612 --> 00:56:58,221
Instead of trying to copy the letters,

937
00:56:59,482 --> 00:57:00,681
pay attention to what I'm about to say.

938
00:57:01,852 --> 00:57:02,951
"Trend of literature."

939
00:57:04,761 --> 00:57:06,391
If you look at each word separately,

940
00:57:06,661 --> 00:57:10,031
it means "the flow of thoughts."

941
00:57:11,732 --> 00:57:13,031
Studying the trend of literature...

942
00:57:14,161 --> 00:57:16,672
is the process of following the thoughts of the era.

943
00:57:16,672 --> 00:57:17,701
It also means...

944
00:57:19,042 --> 00:57:21,542
it will be the process of broadening your world.

945
00:57:22,511 --> 00:57:24,312
Whether it's a poem or a novel,

946
00:57:24,781 --> 00:57:26,442
the moment you face a literary piece,

947
00:57:26,442 --> 00:57:28,152
you must dive into the narrator's world right away.

948
00:57:30,951 --> 00:57:33,951
You must face the world with the same perspective, language,

949
00:57:34,821 --> 00:57:37,891
and ideology of the writer from that era.

950
00:57:40,022 --> 00:57:41,891
Between the reader who can picture a young child...

951
00:57:42,232 --> 00:57:43,632
trying the chili peppers and cigarettes...

952
00:57:43,632 --> 00:57:44,732
while staying at home alone...

953
00:57:44,832 --> 00:57:46,261
and the reader who can't picture the scene at all,

954
00:57:46,261 --> 00:57:47,531
there's an impassable river.

955
00:57:47,531 --> 00:57:48,602
And this means...

956
00:57:51,542 --> 00:57:53,801
I'm sorry to say this, but it will affect your grades.

957
00:57:56,471 --> 00:57:57,471
All right.

958
00:57:57,942 --> 00:58:00,181
As you're in high school, let's study a fitting novel.

959
00:58:00,281 --> 00:58:02,852
We will begin with Yi Gwang Su's novel, "Mujong."

960
00:58:03,652 --> 00:58:06,321
You should have a printout from me. Open the first page!

961
00:58:27,172 --> 00:58:28,172
(Choisun Academy, the 1st class formula)

962
00:58:39,321 --> 00:58:40,882
Here's what you guys have to know.

963
00:58:43,721 --> 00:58:45,862
Every single literary piece in the textbook...

964
00:58:46,692 --> 00:58:48,391
and even a quotation from an essay that appears on your exam...

965
00:58:48,391 --> 00:58:49,431
are chosen with the utmost care.

966
00:58:50,332 --> 00:58:51,962
Distinguished scholars with master's and doctorate degrees,

967
00:58:52,502 --> 00:58:53,732
university professors,

968
00:58:54,161 --> 00:58:56,201
schoolteachers with decades of experience,

969
00:58:56,201 --> 00:58:57,371
and education specialists...

970
00:58:58,172 --> 00:59:01,071
spent considerable time and effort...

971
00:59:01,511 --> 00:59:04,241
handpicking the texts you must read as students.

972
00:59:05,511 --> 00:59:06,542
Gosh.

973
00:59:08,451 --> 00:59:11,721
All this work just for mere middle school graduates.

974
00:59:14,692 --> 00:59:15,821
Sum up "Mujong."

975
00:59:16,821 --> 00:59:18,862
It was published in 1917 through Maeil Sinbo.

976
00:59:18,862 --> 00:59:19,862
The writer, Yi Gwang Su.

977
00:59:19,862 --> 00:59:21,431
The first contemporary full-length novel in Korea.

978
00:59:21,491 --> 00:59:22,491
It explores the awakening of modern ideology,

979
00:59:22,491 --> 00:59:23,491
discovery of self, and so on!

980
00:59:28,172 --> 00:59:31,241
They're not making you read this novel,

981
00:59:31,402 --> 00:59:34,071
so you could mindlessly memorize these bullet points.

982
00:59:42,011 --> 00:59:43,852
Your current teachers...

983
00:59:45,781 --> 00:59:47,752
and the professors who will teach you in the future...

984
00:59:48,192 --> 00:59:50,091
want you to sympathize...

985
00:59:51,462 --> 00:59:54,431
with the struggles and hardships of the people from this era.

986
00:59:55,632 --> 00:59:59,261
Moreover, they want you to broaden your understanding...

987
00:59:59,862 --> 01:00:01,301
of people and the world.

988
01:00:04,301 --> 01:00:05,701
When you come across this piece,

989
01:00:06,571 --> 01:00:08,942
before you recite all the memorized bullet points,

990
01:00:08,942 --> 01:00:11,482
you must be sucked into the main character's dilemma. Yes.

991
01:00:14,612 --> 01:00:15,681
Of course, it won't be easy.

992
01:00:16,582 --> 01:00:19,681
I still remember the shock I had the first time I read this novel.

993
01:00:22,221 --> 01:00:23,451
It was painstakingly boring.

994
01:00:25,321 --> 01:00:26,362
Then...

995
01:00:27,862 --> 01:00:31,402
I decided to tackle this novel with a different set of eyes.

996
01:00:34,332 --> 01:00:36,272
I pretended to secretly read the journal of my oldest brother...

997
01:00:36,502 --> 01:00:38,471
who seemed to have a lot on his mind lately.

998
01:00:39,542 --> 01:00:41,172
What's the main character, Hyung Sik's dilemma?

999
01:00:41,542 --> 01:00:43,911
Who on earth does he love?

1000
01:00:44,582 --> 01:00:46,411
Is it Sun Young? Or Young Chae?

1001
01:00:50,312 --> 01:00:51,321
Don't you see?

1002
01:00:53,321 --> 01:00:55,821
Nothing is more fun than secretly reading your brother's journal...

1003
01:00:55,821 --> 01:00:57,321
about his love triangle. Don't you agree?

1004
01:00:58,261 --> 01:00:59,891
When I read this novel with that mindset...

1005
01:00:59,891 --> 01:01:01,292
Oh, my gosh.

1006
01:01:05,761 --> 01:01:06,801
What a page-turner.

1007
01:01:08,971 --> 01:01:11,902
No novel could be as entertaining as this one.

1008
01:01:26,181 --> 01:01:28,152
(Literature)

1009
01:01:33,292 --> 01:01:34,491
Literary works...

1010
01:01:36,491 --> 01:01:38,462
are like journals...

1011
01:01:38,701 --> 01:01:40,632
in which the writers peer into...

1012
01:01:41,672 --> 01:01:43,471
their inner selves for a long time...

1013
01:01:44,172 --> 01:01:45,341
and subtly express their finding.

1014
01:02:15,871 --> 01:02:17,031
(Appreciation Training)

1015
01:02:27,982 --> 01:02:29,181
Here's my final question for you.

1016
01:02:30,411 --> 01:02:31,721
What did you study today?

1017
01:02:32,482 --> 01:02:34,082
- The flow of thoughts. - The flow of thoughts.

1018
01:02:35,391 --> 01:02:36,422
What was that?

1019
01:02:36,422 --> 01:02:37,991
- The flow of thoughts! - The flow of thoughts!

1020
01:02:38,091 --> 01:02:39,121
That's right.

1021
01:02:39,591 --> 01:02:42,391
Today, you navigated the sea of thoughts...

1022
01:02:42,391 --> 01:02:44,832
from the masses and prominent writers of Korea...

1023
01:02:44,832 --> 01:02:45,902
between 1910,

1024
01:02:46,232 --> 01:02:47,602
the start of the Japanese colonial era,

1025
01:02:47,602 --> 01:02:49,201
and 1945, the year of independence.

1026
01:02:51,772 --> 01:02:53,772
(The flow of modern novels)

1027
01:02:55,911 --> 01:02:57,371
I'm curious if you enjoyed the journey.

1028
01:02:58,382 --> 01:03:00,011
- It was fun. - It was good.

1029
01:03:02,252 --> 01:03:03,252
Thank you.

1030
01:03:04,212 --> 01:03:05,252
Thank you for attending my lecture.

1031
01:03:05,721 --> 01:03:08,192
I am the symbol of First Class, Pyo Sang Seob!

1032
01:03:20,602 --> 01:03:21,632
What a surprise.

1033
01:03:22,832 --> 01:03:25,442
I was so worried when I heard he was quitting school.

1034
01:03:25,672 --> 01:03:26,801
He didn't need us to worry.

1035
01:03:31,882 --> 01:03:32,942
Will you take his class?

1036
01:03:34,681 --> 01:03:37,451
- I'm not sure. - Will you ask your mom and decide?

1037
01:03:38,852 --> 01:03:39,951
No, I won't.

1038
01:03:41,422 --> 01:03:43,692
I'll think about it on my own and make my decision.

1039
01:03:43,891 --> 01:03:44,891
I can do it alone.

1040
01:03:45,292 --> 01:03:46,522
That was a fun lecture.

1041
01:03:47,422 --> 01:03:49,661
- I should check that out. - Right.

1042
01:03:49,792 --> 01:03:51,132
- Really? - Yes.

1043
01:03:52,362 --> 01:03:53,562
What do you want to eat after this?

1044
01:03:58,701 --> 01:04:00,542
I learned a lot, sir.

1045
01:04:01,641 --> 01:04:02,641
Thank you.

1046
01:04:29,071 --> 01:04:30,402
It doesn't sound like nonsense.

1047
01:04:35,511 --> 01:04:36,971
It sounds more like an ideal.

1048
01:04:47,882 --> 01:04:48,922
When are you coming back?

1049
01:04:49,491 --> 01:04:51,221
I finished the first part of the textbook.

1050
01:04:51,862 --> 01:04:54,591
It's enough only for two weeks. But I can't wait to show it to you.

1051
01:05:06,301 --> 01:05:08,612
(Daechi Chase)

1052
01:05:27,462 --> 01:05:29,761
You've been dying to hold this class.

1053
01:05:29,761 --> 01:05:31,062
And it will finally start tomorrow.

1054
01:05:31,402 --> 01:05:32,832
Only with five students.

1055
01:05:34,531 --> 01:05:35,772
The start of the legend.

1056
01:05:37,071 --> 01:05:38,201
You know what?

1057
01:05:38,701 --> 01:05:40,201
How come you're not scared?

1058
01:05:41,942 --> 01:05:43,011
Go ahead.

1059
01:05:45,082 --> 01:05:46,082
Okay.

1060
01:05:52,951 --> 01:05:53,982
What are you doing?

1061
01:05:56,252 --> 01:05:57,321
Mr. Lee.

1062
01:06:02,292 --> 01:06:03,362
All right. Starting now,

1063
01:06:04,161 --> 01:06:07,362
don't make a sound. Just look at the light.

1064
01:06:41,362 --> 01:06:42,701
All right. Top Student Seo Hye Jin.

1065
01:06:43,732 --> 01:06:44,801
What did you just see?

1066
01:06:45,942 --> 01:06:46,942
A fox?

1067
01:06:47,542 --> 01:06:48,542
What else?

1068
01:06:49,272 --> 01:06:51,112
A moth. Like a mayfly.

1069
01:06:51,511 --> 01:06:53,241
I see. Did you hear anything?

1070
01:06:54,911 --> 01:06:55,951
The wind.

1071
01:06:58,522 --> 01:06:59,582
These are the senses required to appreciate...

1072
01:06:59,781 --> 01:07:01,922
"How to Cross a Desert" by Seo Yeong Eun.

1073
01:07:02,652 --> 01:07:05,121
This literary work utilized our physical senses to depict...

1074
01:07:05,221 --> 01:07:06,862
the main character's experience in various ways.

1075
01:07:07,821 --> 01:07:08,832
You all...

1076
01:07:09,391 --> 01:07:11,701
just experienced becoming extremely tense,

1077
01:07:11,701 --> 01:07:13,761
causing your senses to sharpen as a result.

1078
01:07:15,172 --> 01:07:16,201
Should I provide some evidence?

1079
01:07:17,772 --> 01:07:18,801
Stay quiet.

1080
01:07:47,562 --> 01:07:48,632
What does "appreciate" mean?

1081
01:07:49,701 --> 01:07:52,402
The dictionary says it's when you enjoy,

1082
01:07:52,502 --> 01:07:55,011
understand, and criticize a work of art.

1083
01:07:58,741 --> 01:08:01,312
All right. Hieroglyphs were stylized after objects.

1084
01:08:01,312 --> 01:08:02,612
They were modeled after some objects.

1085
01:08:02,712 --> 01:08:03,951
Could you give me an example?

1086
01:08:08,522 --> 01:08:09,591
Your class.

1087
01:08:10,451 --> 01:08:13,362
Out of all the Korean classes I'd heard so far,

1088
01:08:14,522 --> 01:08:15,562
it was the best.

1089
01:08:21,232 --> 01:08:22,232
But...

1090
01:08:23,671 --> 01:08:25,301
she wrote that over the semester.

1091
01:08:26,772 --> 01:08:28,072
I felt so embarrassed.

1092
01:08:35,852 --> 01:08:36,852
Jun Ho.

1093
01:08:37,652 --> 01:08:38,852
Focus on the sound of the wind.

1094
01:08:42,921 --> 01:08:43,952
Lee Jun Ho.

1095
01:08:46,162 --> 01:08:47,221
You won.

1096
01:08:49,961 --> 01:08:51,032
You won.

1097
01:09:15,591 --> 01:09:18,322
I want to complete the puzzle before the new semester begins.

1098
01:09:18,862 --> 01:09:21,362
Of course. It will be either expedited...

1099
01:09:21,362 --> 01:09:23,862
or delayed based on your position.

1100
01:09:24,662 --> 01:09:26,202
Could you give me a bit more time?

1101
01:09:28,532 --> 01:09:30,431
I think I gave you ample time.

1102
01:09:30,602 --> 01:09:31,942
I'm expecting someone.

1103
01:09:32,841 --> 01:09:33,841
Pardon?

1104
01:09:36,942 --> 01:09:38,942
Who could it be? I can't wait to find out.

1105
01:09:40,041 --> 01:09:41,242
You won't be disappointed.

1106
01:09:56,131 --> 01:09:58,801
She's here. Here comes another big fan of mine.

1107
01:09:58,902 --> 01:10:01,532
Please sit down, Ms. Choi. This way.

1108
01:10:03,831 --> 01:10:05,372
We're ready for our meal now.

1109
01:10:05,471 --> 01:10:06,501
Yes, ma'am.

1110
01:10:12,442 --> 01:10:14,482
I told them to prepare a meal for two people.

1111
01:10:15,051 --> 01:10:17,181
I didn't think I had any business of being here.

1112
01:10:17,551 --> 01:10:20,381
I hope you will take your time to enjoy the meal thoroughly.

1113
01:10:21,181 --> 01:10:22,221
Oh, right. Here.

1114
01:10:23,921 --> 01:10:25,591
You can discuss what to do with this.

1115
01:10:26,622 --> 01:10:28,122
You can give it to someone...

1116
01:10:28,122 --> 01:10:30,131
or make posters and put them up.

1117
01:10:33,301 --> 01:10:34,931
I don't think there's any instructor...

1118
01:10:34,931 --> 01:10:37,902
who could give a better lecture than I am because they have my materials.

1119
01:10:38,442 --> 01:10:41,812
But then again, you guys are very good at discovering new talent.

1120
01:10:42,372 --> 01:10:44,312
I'm sure you will have no problem knowing what to do with this.

1121
01:10:45,181 --> 01:10:46,312
I understand your decision.

1122
01:10:47,511 --> 01:10:48,812
Let me ask you why then.

1123
01:10:49,381 --> 01:10:50,381
It's because...

1124
01:10:55,221 --> 01:10:56,791
I don't treasure this anymore.

1125
01:11:23,352 --> 01:11:26,982
(The Midnight Romance in Hagwon)

1126
01:11:27,652 --> 01:11:29,152
She must have thought...

1127
01:11:29,152 --> 01:11:30,852
it would be over once she gave up on the materials.

1128
01:11:31,122 --> 01:11:32,322
But we're just getting started.

1129
01:11:32,862 --> 01:11:33,891
Did you guys get caught?

1130
01:11:33,891 --> 01:11:35,631
Because you're involved with me,

1131
01:11:35,631 --> 01:11:37,032
we'll face the nastiest gossip.

1132
01:11:37,032 --> 01:11:38,091
Gosh. Unbelievable!

1133
01:11:38,091 --> 01:11:40,761
- Seo Hye Jin's career is finished. - What if I asked you out?

1134
01:11:41,062 --> 01:11:42,131
Would I have had a shot?

1135
01:11:42,532 --> 01:11:45,641
I'm saying that this academy will become a wrecked ship soon.

1136
01:11:46,442 --> 01:11:47,501
Are you going to deny it?

1137
01:11:47,772 --> 01:11:49,372
Are you going to say it's a rumor? That it's not true?

1138
01:11:49,912 --> 01:11:51,841
You'll end up disgraced.

1139
01:11:51,841 --> 01:11:53,181
(OST "Simple Melody" by The Restless Age released)

1140
01:11:53,181 --> 01:11:54,612
I'll be the one disgraced.
