(The Midnight Romance in Hagwon)

6
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:49,619
I've been thinking,

7
00:00:49,620 --> 00:00:50,889
but there was not a chance you didn't know.

8
00:00:54,520 --> 00:00:55,959
That my first love...

9
00:00:58,190 --> 00:00:59,190
was you.

10
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:04,699
What are you talking about?

11
00:01:04,700 --> 00:01:05,730
Now,

12
00:01:07,429 --> 00:01:08,469
I can't push my feelings away...

13
00:01:08,470 --> 00:01:09,970
with the excuse of first love anymore.

14
00:01:15,979 --> 00:01:18,449
I'm struggling to control my feelings for you...

15
00:01:18,580 --> 00:01:19,580
as they get bigger.

16
00:02:23,710 --> 00:02:24,780
You...

17
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:26,680
You're going to catch a cold.

18
00:02:28,049 --> 00:02:30,220
- I don't care. - No, I care.

19
00:02:31,389 --> 00:02:34,019
Keeping our throat healthy is very important for instructors.

20
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:36,690
You must have misunderstood me.

21
00:02:37,389 --> 00:02:39,488
I told you I didn't want to go back because...

22
00:02:39,489 --> 00:02:42,728
I mean, I was once against you joining the academy.

23
00:02:42,729 --> 00:02:45,469
But you're adjusting to this field better than I thought.

24
00:02:45,470 --> 00:02:47,568
So I wanted to be a good influence on you...

25
00:02:47,569 --> 00:02:49,000
- A good influence... - Ms. Seo.

26
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:52,440
You're the one who misunderstood me.

27
00:02:52,940 --> 00:02:53,970
What?

28
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:55,840
I just confessed my feelings to you.

29
00:02:58,710 --> 00:02:59,710
Okay.

30
00:03:02,019 --> 00:03:03,448
You should dry your clothes first.

31
00:03:03,449 --> 00:03:04,649
Seriously. Your special lecture is around the corner.

32
00:03:04,650 --> 00:03:06,150
If you catch a cold... I'm begging you.

33
00:03:07,319 --> 00:03:08,389
Dry your clothes first.

34
00:03:14,329 --> 00:03:15,960
Sure, if you need some time to think.

35
00:03:29,940 --> 00:03:32,079
- Pass me my bag over there. - Sure.

36
00:03:33,250 --> 00:03:35,519
Ms. Seo didn't come back.

37
00:03:36,220 --> 00:03:37,750
Mr. Kim is probably holding her hostage.

38
00:03:38,620 --> 00:03:40,519
Darn it. I can't seem to book a driver.

39
00:03:41,660 --> 00:03:43,319
What if something happened to her?

40
00:03:43,859 --> 00:03:45,488
No way. Mr. Lee is with her.

41
00:03:45,489 --> 00:03:46,489
Nothing's going to happen.

42
00:03:50,630 --> 00:03:51,699
Hey,

43
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,769
how about raiding Mr. Kim's liquor cabinet in his office?

44
00:03:54,329 --> 00:03:55,569
What was that called?

45
00:03:56,039 --> 00:03:58,739
He has that fancy liquor. Single-something liquor.

46
00:04:03,139 --> 00:04:04,180
Let's go.

47
00:04:04,310 --> 00:04:05,979
Hey. Off to his office.

48
00:04:50,489 --> 00:04:52,189
It'll be fine as long as we take a few sips.

49
00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:53,858
I feel bad that I'm leaving before you.

50
00:04:53,859 --> 00:04:55,929
- Gosh. Don't worry. Go ahead. - Right. Wait.

51
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:57,199
- I know I can fool him. - Bye.

52
00:04:57,200 --> 00:04:58,569
- Be safe. Go ahead. - Hey.

53
00:04:58,570 --> 00:05:00,169
- No. - Gosh. Stop that.

54
00:05:00,470 --> 00:05:01,470
Let's go home together.

55
00:05:01,471 --> 00:05:02,938
- I'll go around and drop you off. - What?

56
00:05:02,939 --> 00:05:04,470
- No. Wait. - No.

57
00:05:05,340 --> 00:05:07,069
I'm sorry. I must get going first.

58
00:05:07,070 --> 00:05:08,839
- Gosh. It's fine. Bye. - Sorry.

59
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:10,238
- Bye. - Bye.

60
00:05:10,239 --> 00:05:11,309
No.

61
00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:14,379
- Gosh. - Stop it.

62
00:05:16,150 --> 00:05:18,320
The taxi fare is incredibly expensive.

63
00:05:18,390 --> 00:05:19,989
Why would I take a taxi? That's crazy.

64
00:05:26,390 --> 00:05:27,459
I've been thinking,

65
00:05:27,460 --> 00:05:28,760
but there was not a chance you didn't know.

66
00:05:31,229 --> 00:05:32,499
That my first love...

67
00:05:34,939 --> 00:05:35,999
was you.

68
00:05:53,020 --> 00:05:54,049
I must have lost my mind.

69
00:06:24,450 --> 00:06:25,520
Why are you here?

70
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:31,330
What...

71
00:06:32,489 --> 00:06:34,900
What are you doing here at this hour?

72
00:06:35,799 --> 00:06:37,129
Why are you here?

73
00:06:37,260 --> 00:06:40,999
I should be asking you that. Didn't you leave to meet Mr. Kim?

74
00:06:45,439 --> 00:06:47,710
- Is that... - No.

75
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:49,080
That's mine.

76
00:06:49,679 --> 00:06:50,979
That's mine.

77
00:06:51,109 --> 00:06:52,780
Gosh. You startled me.

78
00:06:55,450 --> 00:06:56,520
What?

79
00:06:57,020 --> 00:06:58,849
Well, I challenged the director...

80
00:06:58,850 --> 00:07:01,359
because of what he did with my students from Chanyoung High.

81
00:07:02,260 --> 00:07:03,890
When I told him I wanted an apology,

82
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:06,129
things got heated. So...

83
00:07:07,030 --> 00:07:09,628
He jumped into the water because he didn't want to apologize?

84
00:07:09,629 --> 00:07:11,128
No. That's not what happened.

85
00:07:11,129 --> 00:07:13,799
He just missed his footing or something like that.

86
00:07:16,900 --> 00:07:18,108
They weren't on good terms...

87
00:07:18,109 --> 00:07:19,510
because of the recent change with Chanyoung High.

88
00:07:19,609 --> 00:07:22,309
I was going to stay put and observe the situation.

89
00:07:22,479 --> 00:07:23,979
When he missed his footing,

90
00:07:24,650 --> 00:07:27,410
he grabbed me tightly. So this happened.

91
00:07:30,220 --> 00:07:31,350
Well,

92
00:07:32,590 --> 00:07:36,390
everything seems to make sense and not make sense at the same time.

93
00:07:36,789 --> 00:07:39,459
You can ask the director. He will give you the same story.

94
00:07:39,460 --> 00:07:41,160
Gosh. Why would I ask him that?

95
00:07:41,830 --> 00:07:42,929
I'll take your word for it.

96
00:07:43,559 --> 00:07:45,728
It's not like I saw you guys doing something improper.

97
00:07:45,729 --> 00:07:46,829
Even if I did,

98
00:07:46,830 --> 00:07:47,868
I don't have any right...

99
00:07:47,869 --> 00:07:48,899
to tell you what to do with your romantic feelings.

100
00:07:48,900 --> 00:07:50,039
No.

101
00:07:50,299 --> 00:07:53,309
Gosh. Romantic feelings? It's nothing like that.

102
00:07:54,010 --> 00:07:55,910
Right. I believe you.

103
00:07:57,039 --> 00:07:59,350
But what are you doing here at this hour?

104
00:07:59,549 --> 00:08:00,609
It's pretty late.

105
00:08:00,950 --> 00:08:01,979
Me?

106
00:08:02,650 --> 00:08:03,819
I couldn't get a taxi.

107
00:08:03,820 --> 00:08:04,850
I see.

108
00:08:08,090 --> 00:08:09,090
That was a lie.

109
00:08:09,859 --> 00:08:11,119
I didn't want to waste money on the taxi.

110
00:08:11,460 --> 00:08:13,390
I was going to stay here until the first bus started running.

111
00:08:13,530 --> 00:08:15,600
The sofa in the director's office seemed nice and comfy.

112
00:08:16,260 --> 00:08:17,299
I see.

113
00:08:19,570 --> 00:08:21,229
If you don't mind, come to my house.

114
00:08:22,070 --> 00:08:23,299
Your house?

115
00:08:23,640 --> 00:08:25,808
I was going to call a taxi.

116
00:08:25,809 --> 00:08:28,308
I'd feel bad leaving you here, knowing you'd sleep here.

117
00:08:28,309 --> 00:08:30,108
Gosh. It's okay.

118
00:08:30,109 --> 00:08:32,749
I'll just stay here until the first bus starts running.

119
00:08:33,650 --> 00:08:34,850
I wouldn't feel good about it.

120
00:08:36,950 --> 00:08:38,820
- What about your family? - I live alone.

121
00:08:40,920 --> 00:08:42,658
But still. What if I end up becoming a nuisance?

122
00:08:42,659 --> 00:08:44,590
Gosh, no. A nuisance? No way.

123
00:08:44,930 --> 00:08:46,859
Then I'll really take you up on that offer.

124
00:08:47,190 --> 00:08:48,300
Please do.

125
00:08:50,159 --> 00:08:52,169
Let me go and get my toothbrush and stuff.

126
00:08:52,170 --> 00:08:53,200
Sure.

127
00:08:56,100 --> 00:08:57,970
Mr. Lee. Your shirt is dry. You can wear that now.

128
00:08:59,109 --> 00:09:01,540
Wait. What's this?

129
00:09:01,779 --> 00:09:04,180
- What? - We're not done talking yet.

130
00:09:04,279 --> 00:09:05,508
I explained everything to you.

131
00:09:05,509 --> 00:09:06,978
No. What explanation?

132
00:09:06,979 --> 00:09:08,019
By the way...

133
00:09:09,050 --> 00:09:10,080
Yes?

134
00:09:11,119 --> 00:09:13,389
- Yes. - Why do you look so startled?

135
00:09:13,550 --> 00:09:15,359
Nothing. What is it?

136
00:09:15,759 --> 00:09:18,429
Right. Was there a time when it was...

137
00:09:18,430 --> 00:09:21,800
just the two of you at the academy like today?

138
00:09:24,460 --> 00:09:25,970
(1st-year High School, Korean, Seo Hye Jin)

139
00:09:29,239 --> 00:09:30,339
Why are you suddenly asking us that?

140
00:09:30,340 --> 00:09:33,339
I get that feeling that something like this happened...

141
00:09:33,340 --> 00:09:34,369
once before.

142
00:09:34,509 --> 00:09:36,609
Oh, yes. We had to stay behind to prepare for our joint lecture.

143
00:09:38,509 --> 00:09:39,850
- I'll go and get my stuff. - Yes.

144
00:09:44,350 --> 00:09:45,389
Stop.

145
00:09:59,399 --> 00:10:00,469
(Reserved)

146
00:10:00,470 --> 00:10:01,570
Get home safely.

147
00:10:03,670 --> 00:10:04,700
I'll call you.

148
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:49,350
Gosh.

149
00:10:50,350 --> 00:10:52,350
Goodness.

150
00:10:53,619 --> 00:10:54,690
It's so cold.

151
00:11:08,940 --> 00:11:09,970
It's cold.

152
00:11:13,639 --> 00:11:14,710
Gosh. Darn it.

153
00:11:18,609 --> 00:11:19,609
Come on.

154
00:11:23,420 --> 00:11:25,148
Maybe, we should've stopped by a convenience store.

155
00:11:25,149 --> 00:11:26,220
I have nothing to offer you.

156
00:11:26,690 --> 00:11:28,119
I told you I was fine.

157
00:11:28,359 --> 00:11:30,389
- Water will be fine. - Well,

158
00:11:30,820 --> 00:11:32,460
I have beer and coffee.

159
00:11:33,590 --> 00:11:34,729
Then beer it is, of course.

160
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:42,739
You have a nice house.

161
00:11:44,340 --> 00:11:45,868
Things are going to be tough starting now.

162
00:11:45,869 --> 00:11:48,009
It's an old apartment, so it's cold in winter.

163
00:11:49,379 --> 00:11:50,979
They said the pipes were old or something.

164
00:11:52,249 --> 00:11:54,709
They said I had to pick a day and remove all of them.

165
00:11:54,710 --> 00:11:56,749
But I live in this cold apartment because I don't have time for that.

166
00:11:57,879 --> 00:11:59,690
I currently live in a one-bedroom.

167
00:11:59,989 --> 00:12:01,619
I've been saving up aggressively.

168
00:12:02,159 --> 00:12:03,359
I want to live in an apartment.

169
00:12:04,690 --> 00:12:07,690
You should live in a new apartment, not an old one like this if you can.

170
00:12:08,129 --> 00:12:09,159
You bet.

171
00:12:09,560 --> 00:12:11,329
You might not know this, but I signed up to a savings account...

172
00:12:11,330 --> 00:12:12,800
for the housing subscription plan at the age of 20.

173
00:12:33,590 --> 00:12:36,519
(Ms. Seo: My phone must have...)

174
00:12:37,460 --> 00:12:39,460
My phone must have been damaged when I fell into the water.

175
00:12:40,159 --> 00:12:41,290
I'll contact you tomorrow.

176
00:12:56,540 --> 00:12:58,450
Given the situation, I know you can't text me back.

177
00:12:58,649 --> 00:12:59,779
So I won't wait for your reply.

178
00:13:02,479 --> 00:13:04,378
It would've been better if we could talk a bit more.

179
00:13:04,379 --> 00:13:05,389
But well,

180
00:13:06,050 --> 00:13:07,249
we have a lot of time ahead of us.

181
00:13:08,259 --> 00:13:10,018
(I don't care if you tell me...)

182
00:13:10,019 --> 00:13:12,829
(you want to switch to Choisun Academy...)

183
00:13:12,830 --> 00:13:13,889
I don't care...

184
00:13:14,389 --> 00:13:15,758
if you tell me you want to switch to Choisun Academy...

185
00:13:15,759 --> 00:13:17,600
or fly to the moon for that matter.

186
00:13:18,629 --> 00:13:19,670
Goodnight.

187
00:13:36,249 --> 00:13:38,649
I hate keeping secrets.

188
00:13:41,090 --> 00:13:42,889
But I won't tell anyone what I saw today.

189
00:13:44,290 --> 00:13:46,190
I think that will be better for everyone.

190
00:13:48,930 --> 00:13:49,960
Thank you.

191
00:13:52,300 --> 00:13:54,830
It'd be great if you don't speak to me so formally.

192
00:14:01,409 --> 00:14:02,409
Thanks.

193
00:14:03,639 --> 00:14:04,710
Then...

194
00:14:05,479 --> 00:14:08,210
don't tell anyone that I went back to the academy...

195
00:14:08,749 --> 00:14:09,779
instead of calling a taxi.

196
00:14:11,279 --> 00:14:12,550
It makes me look pathetic.

197
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:15,759
I won't.

198
00:14:17,060 --> 00:14:18,159
Okay.

199
00:14:21,159 --> 00:14:23,129
Gosh. I'm going to sleep now.

200
00:14:24,259 --> 00:14:25,269
Okay.

201
00:15:08,540 --> 00:15:09,878
(I don't care...)

202
00:15:09,879 --> 00:15:11,209
(if you tell me you want to switch to Choisun Academy...)

203
00:15:11,210 --> 00:15:12,580
(or fly to the moon for that matter.)

204
00:15:14,109 --> 00:15:15,220
Lee Jun Ho...

205
00:15:16,950 --> 00:15:18,489
He's a teacher now.

206
00:15:50,649 --> 00:15:51,649
It's 2.2 dollars.

207
00:15:53,450 --> 00:15:54,649
Thank you.

208
00:16:12,940 --> 00:16:14,040
Hello, Ms. Woo.

209
00:16:14,310 --> 00:16:15,340
Hey.

210
00:16:15,779 --> 00:16:18,479
I hope I didn't call too early.

211
00:16:20,479 --> 00:16:22,519
Well, it's nothing serious.

212
00:16:23,279 --> 00:16:27,019
I was wondering if you met with Mr. Kim last night.

213
00:16:29,460 --> 00:16:30,519
Is that so?

214
00:16:31,159 --> 00:16:32,590
Around what time was that?

215
00:16:34,460 --> 00:16:37,359
Well, I'm only asking because...

216
00:16:37,899 --> 00:16:39,528
he didn't attend the meeting today...

217
00:16:39,529 --> 00:16:41,329
with the support team when he has a lot of documents to approve.

218
00:16:41,330 --> 00:16:42,499
I can't reach him either.

219
00:17:06,659 --> 00:17:07,790
I must call 911.

220
00:17:08,699 --> 00:17:09,830
Nine, one, one...

221
00:17:10,760 --> 00:17:11,800
Nine, one, one...

222
00:17:36,459 --> 00:17:38,260
Oh, no.

223
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:04,178
- Mr. Yoon. - Hey, you got here early.

224
00:18:04,179 --> 00:18:06,089
Sorry. Since the director lives alone,

225
00:18:06,090 --> 00:18:07,589
it felt awkward to go there by myself.

226
00:18:07,590 --> 00:18:08,959
No, I'm glad you called.

227
00:18:09,560 --> 00:18:10,760
All right. Let's go.

228
00:18:18,899 --> 00:18:20,000
Director.

229
00:18:20,770 --> 00:18:22,139
It's Yoon Ji Seok.

230
00:18:27,810 --> 00:18:30,040
Director, it's Yoon Ji Seok. Aren't you home?

231
00:18:34,609 --> 00:18:35,719
Director.

232
00:18:39,719 --> 00:18:42,060
- Director. - Coming.

233
00:18:46,830 --> 00:18:47,929
Aren't you home?

234
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:52,830
Gosh, I've been saved.

235
00:18:58,810 --> 00:19:00,408
- Come inside. - What?

236
00:19:00,409 --> 00:19:01,909
- Come on. - Wait a little.

237
00:19:02,179 --> 00:19:03,240
I'll open the door for you soon.

238
00:19:10,619 --> 00:19:12,619
(Authorized Dealer, Internet, IPTV, CCTV, Door Guard)

239
00:19:26,530 --> 00:19:27,629
Yes, it's me.

240
00:19:28,129 --> 00:19:29,300
You haven't gone to work yet, have you?

241
00:19:29,869 --> 00:19:31,169
I'll come to you.

242
00:19:31,270 --> 00:19:33,240
Let's have lunch together, and then...

243
00:19:35,909 --> 00:19:36,980
What?

244
00:19:37,379 --> 00:19:39,179
I'm outside right now. I'm busy.

245
00:19:42,219 --> 00:19:44,580
- Hey, come in. - Yes, I'll get back to you soon.

246
00:19:58,100 --> 00:19:59,169
Yes, Ms. Woo.

247
00:20:00,770 --> 00:20:01,800
Yes, well...

248
00:20:03,300 --> 00:20:04,869
He seemed very sick.

249
00:20:06,070 --> 00:20:07,740
No, with Mr. Yoon.

250
00:20:08,709 --> 00:20:11,080
Yes, during the housewarming party last time.

251
00:20:11,810 --> 00:20:14,179
Right. We'll keep an eye on his condition...

252
00:20:14,609 --> 00:20:16,250
and take him to the hospital if we have to.

253
00:20:22,189 --> 00:20:23,820
Will you be able to go and catch a taxi?

254
00:20:24,260 --> 00:20:25,290
No.

255
00:20:26,990 --> 00:20:28,429
- Shall I call an ambulance? - No.

256
00:20:36,340 --> 00:20:37,369
Gosh.

257
00:20:39,070 --> 00:20:40,169
Where do you keep your emergency medicine?

258
00:20:42,740 --> 00:20:43,780
In the...

259
00:20:44,179 --> 00:20:46,649
Pardon? Gosh.

260
00:20:47,709 --> 00:20:48,750
Gosh, you wreak of alcohol.

261
00:20:50,219 --> 00:20:51,520
Are you sick or hungover?

262
00:20:53,389 --> 00:20:54,419
Both.

263
00:20:55,760 --> 00:20:57,418
Okay, then. Bye.

264
00:20:57,419 --> 00:20:59,429
(Daechi Chase)

265
00:21:00,290 --> 00:21:02,399
Is he sick?

266
00:21:05,129 --> 00:21:06,230
Well...

267
00:21:08,070 --> 00:21:09,939
I'll get approval afterward.

268
00:21:11,240 --> 00:21:14,438
Take care of the things...

269
00:21:14,439 --> 00:21:16,179
that need to be approved today.

270
00:21:16,709 --> 00:21:17,740
Yes, ma'am.

271
00:21:18,340 --> 00:21:21,649
And get me Ms. Seo Hye Jin's contract.

272
00:21:25,619 --> 00:21:26,689
What are you doing?

273
00:21:27,389 --> 00:21:29,459
Oh, okay, ma'am.

274
00:21:34,230 --> 00:21:35,290
Gosh.

275
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,659
I've contacted...

276
00:21:39,270 --> 00:21:42,030
all of the Chanyoung High mothers who attended the info session.

277
00:21:43,369 --> 00:21:46,139
First of all, their expectations for your leadership...

278
00:21:46,310 --> 00:21:48,840
and lecture skills were very high.

279
00:21:50,340 --> 00:21:51,609
Just go ahead and say it.

280
00:21:52,980 --> 00:21:54,179
Well, I think...

281
00:21:55,379 --> 00:21:57,280
many people thought it was...

282
00:21:57,520 --> 00:21:59,820
hard to handle the change in schedule.

283
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:06,990
We were dealt a big blow by Daechi Chase.

284
00:22:08,800 --> 00:22:11,428
The number of students who were certain about registering...

285
00:22:11,429 --> 00:22:13,070
wasn't that low.

286
00:22:14,030 --> 00:22:17,199
But to open up your in-person lecture, it was a bit... Yes.

287
00:22:17,770 --> 00:22:20,638
Which of these kids has the highest grades?

288
00:22:20,639 --> 00:22:23,639
Yes, it's... Her name is Byun Ha Jung.

289
00:22:24,909 --> 00:22:26,379
Oh, right.

290
00:22:26,980 --> 00:22:28,750
She got a second class in the March mock exam,

291
00:22:29,679 --> 00:22:33,349
and she got a fourth class in the last midterm exams.

292
00:22:33,350 --> 00:22:34,889
Her school grades aren't that great.

293
00:22:39,889 --> 00:22:42,530
Have you not heard back about the contract you sent?

294
00:22:44,459 --> 00:22:46,100
She won't be able to turn it down.

295
00:22:46,469 --> 00:22:48,070
They're the perfect terms.

296
00:22:51,199 --> 00:22:53,609
You live alone, but you don't even have emergency medicine.

297
00:22:53,810 --> 00:22:54,840
What is this?

298
00:22:55,469 --> 00:22:57,480
You're only making Mr. Yoon suffer.

299
00:23:01,649 --> 00:23:02,679
Sorry.

300
00:23:03,179 --> 00:23:05,119
You don't have to be sorry to me.

301
00:23:06,419 --> 00:23:07,520
Not that.

302
00:23:08,590 --> 00:23:11,090
I'm really apologizing.

303
00:23:12,189 --> 00:23:13,790
For what I couldn't do yesterday.

304
00:23:14,129 --> 00:23:15,189
That's fine.

305
00:23:18,399 --> 00:23:19,429
In the early morning,

306
00:23:20,300 --> 00:23:21,800
I was aching so much.

307
00:23:22,899 --> 00:23:25,240
I thought I was really going to die at this rate.

308
00:23:26,909 --> 00:23:28,669
When I thought I was dying,

309
00:23:29,939 --> 00:23:33,510
I thought of just three things I regretted.

310
00:23:38,050 --> 00:23:39,490
You have to ask me what they were.

311
00:23:41,719 --> 00:23:42,719
What were they?

312
00:23:43,619 --> 00:23:44,719
The first one was...

313
00:23:46,060 --> 00:23:47,129
the scenario.

314
00:23:48,659 --> 00:23:51,000
It was so bad that I had stuck it in a drawer.

315
00:23:53,030 --> 00:23:54,169
In case someone saw it.

316
00:23:54,570 --> 00:23:56,070
I should burn it before I die.

317
00:23:57,969 --> 00:23:59,070
The second was...

318
00:23:59,810 --> 00:24:02,580
Gosh. My parents...

319
00:24:03,310 --> 00:24:06,379
whose hobby is to worry about their unmarried son.

320
00:24:09,250 --> 00:24:11,350
And the last one was Seo Hye Jin.

321
00:24:12,790 --> 00:24:14,290
Is it all right for me to be included in there?

322
00:24:18,859 --> 00:24:19,889
I know...

323
00:24:20,730 --> 00:24:22,459
that you were greatly disappointed in me.

324
00:24:25,199 --> 00:24:26,570
When you said the thing I broke...

325
00:24:27,429 --> 00:24:28,830
wasn't the Chanyoung High class...

326
00:24:30,399 --> 00:24:32,669
but our trust...

327
00:24:34,669 --> 00:24:36,179
That was really mean.

328
00:24:40,709 --> 00:24:41,780
Even if...

329
00:24:43,550 --> 00:24:45,990
you look for another job because of this,

330
00:24:50,359 --> 00:24:51,419
I'll accept it.

331
00:24:53,490 --> 00:24:56,030
I'd appreciate it even more if you didn't, though.

332
00:24:58,129 --> 00:24:59,169
How shameless am I?

333
00:25:01,800 --> 00:25:02,840
Gosh.

334
00:25:07,270 --> 00:25:08,340
Drink.

335
00:25:12,879 --> 00:25:14,050
What is up with you?

336
00:25:14,810 --> 00:25:16,119
Goodness.

337
00:25:16,280 --> 00:25:18,550
We should check the other kids' notes on this too.

338
00:25:18,719 --> 00:25:19,790
Okay.

339
00:25:20,090 --> 00:25:22,290
I saw this in Heewon High's past exams. I'll go and make a copy.

340
00:25:22,389 --> 00:25:23,459
Okay.

341
00:25:28,359 --> 00:25:31,530
(Print, Grammar Chapter 1)

342
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,100
(Printing pages 1 to 21 currently printing page 14)

343
00:25:34,530 --> 00:25:36,469
(Printing Room)

344
00:25:54,750 --> 00:25:56,689
Ms. Seo, when are you coming?

345
00:26:00,060 --> 00:26:01,189
Oh, right.

346
00:26:01,389 --> 00:26:03,500
I got a job offer from Choisun Academy.

347
00:26:04,830 --> 00:26:06,800
What? I couldn't hear you well over the water.

348
00:26:07,969 --> 00:26:09,639
Choisun Academy asked me to come.

349
00:26:10,300 --> 00:26:11,669
I've pretty much decided.

350
00:26:12,969 --> 00:26:15,309
The issue is that my contract right now...

351
00:26:15,310 --> 00:26:18,439
prohibits me from working in the vicinity for a year.

352
00:26:18,709 --> 00:26:21,609
But Choisun says they will handle that themselves too.

353
00:26:24,550 --> 00:26:26,290
Oh, well... Wait.

354
00:26:27,790 --> 00:26:29,560
Gosh. No, it's fine.

355
00:26:31,219 --> 00:26:32,260
Oh, thank you.

356
00:27:01,490 --> 00:27:02,490
It's a good thing.

357
00:27:05,060 --> 00:27:07,560
It'll be a huge blow to the academy, though.

358
00:27:08,490 --> 00:27:10,530
And it'll be a huge shock to that guy,

359
00:27:12,359 --> 00:27:14,269
but it's a good thing for you, personally.

360
00:27:14,270 --> 00:27:15,770
You've already shown enough loyalty so far.

361
00:27:17,699 --> 00:27:18,740
Indeed.

362
00:27:20,909 --> 00:27:24,139
I thought you'd say that.

363
00:27:24,310 --> 00:27:25,909
Then, will you move after the final exams?

364
00:27:27,649 --> 00:27:28,679
Probably?

365
00:27:30,619 --> 00:27:32,419
We'll still meet often even if you move academies, right?

366
00:27:33,790 --> 00:27:34,820
Of course.

367
00:27:35,619 --> 00:27:36,619
Congratulations.

368
00:27:41,290 --> 00:27:43,198
You were here, Mr. Lee.

369
00:27:43,199 --> 00:27:44,199
Oh, yes.

370
00:27:45,800 --> 00:27:48,369
I'm sorry. This is going to take me a while.

371
00:27:49,340 --> 00:27:50,639
I'll wait a bit, then.

372
00:27:54,409 --> 00:27:56,909
Why didn't you come back yesterday?

373
00:27:58,810 --> 00:27:59,810
The team dinner.

374
00:28:00,609 --> 00:28:03,949
Oh, I had some stuff to do afterward.

375
00:28:05,250 --> 00:28:08,649
I feel kind of disappointed that you keep bailing on us each time.

376
00:28:09,560 --> 00:28:11,590
Gosh, I can't believe I've disappointed you.

377
00:28:12,119 --> 00:28:13,730
I have been neglecting my duties as a junior teacher.

378
00:28:16,359 --> 00:28:17,859
Then, buy me a meal sometime.

379
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:21,429
- What? - Why?

380
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:25,039
Is there some reason why we can't have a meal together?

381
00:28:25,040 --> 00:28:27,139
Like a girlfriend, perhaps?

382
00:28:28,109 --> 00:28:29,179
Well...

383
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:33,850
There is someone I like.

384
00:28:34,780 --> 00:28:36,020
She's not my girlfriend yet, though.

385
00:28:38,280 --> 00:28:39,290
Right.

386
00:28:40,419 --> 00:28:41,419
I see.

387
00:28:43,560 --> 00:28:44,560
Is it finished?

388
00:28:49,300 --> 00:28:50,300
Here.

389
00:28:53,169 --> 00:28:56,600
Does your fling not even like you eating with a colleague?

390
00:28:58,740 --> 00:29:00,169
I'm sure she doesn't.

391
00:29:00,909 --> 00:29:02,169
Then buy me a meal.

392
00:29:09,879 --> 00:29:10,879
My fling?

393
00:29:15,189 --> 00:29:16,189
My fling.

394
00:29:38,840 --> 00:29:41,449
By the way, Jun Ho might be disappointed.

395
00:29:44,580 --> 00:29:46,090
Well, he just looks up to you so much.

396
00:29:46,850 --> 00:29:48,820
The two of you pulled off the Heewon High thing together too.

397
00:29:51,419 --> 00:29:52,459
I don't care...

398
00:29:53,030 --> 00:29:54,428
if you tell me you want to switch to Choisun Academy...

399
00:29:54,429 --> 00:29:56,199
or fly to the moon for that matter.

400
00:29:57,159 --> 00:29:58,230
He says he doesn't care.

401
00:29:59,530 --> 00:30:00,570
You already told him?

402
00:30:01,869 --> 00:30:03,868
He should be the first to know.

403
00:30:03,869 --> 00:30:05,300
This is about Heewon High School.

404
00:30:06,340 --> 00:30:08,270
Oh, that's true.

405
00:30:08,939 --> 00:30:10,310
It is about Heewon High.

406
00:30:11,340 --> 00:30:12,509
Sorry, we're late.

407
00:30:12,510 --> 00:30:14,480
- Hello. - Hello.

408
00:30:22,990 --> 00:30:24,219
Is the director very sick?

409
00:30:24,760 --> 00:30:25,790
Yes, it's pretty bad.

410
00:30:26,359 --> 00:30:27,459
But how did you know?

411
00:30:28,929 --> 00:30:30,458
If Ms. Choi in the office knows,

412
00:30:30,459 --> 00:30:32,030
it's only a matter of time before the whole world knows, right?

413
00:30:35,270 --> 00:30:37,369
If our team is all here, shall we have a meeting in ten minutes?

414
00:30:37,899 --> 00:30:39,000
- Okay. - Okay.

415
00:30:43,780 --> 00:30:45,040
Big news.

416
00:30:45,280 --> 00:30:46,879
It better be big.

417
00:30:47,379 --> 00:30:48,409
Seo Hye Jin.

418
00:30:49,149 --> 00:30:50,149
Yes?

419
00:30:50,150 --> 00:30:51,250
She might be quitting.

420
00:30:52,419 --> 00:30:53,449
What?

421
00:30:53,550 --> 00:30:55,790
The vice-director asked to see her contract.

422
00:30:57,119 --> 00:30:58,119
Are you sure?

423
00:30:58,320 --> 00:30:59,759
The director is out sick.

424
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:01,490
And the vice-director is totally down in the mouth.

425
00:31:01,990 --> 00:31:04,530
I'm not sure, but doesn't it feel totally weird?

426
00:31:04,730 --> 00:31:07,968
Come on. No way.

427
00:31:07,969 --> 00:31:09,770
But what if she really is quitting?

428
00:31:10,439 --> 00:31:13,369
Think about how much revenue Seo Hye Jin alone brings in a month.

429
00:31:14,709 --> 00:31:17,079
And the teachers whose time slots are before and after hers...

430
00:31:17,080 --> 00:31:19,240
bring in quite a lot of money too.

431
00:31:20,510 --> 00:31:21,579
What if the academy is ruined?

432
00:31:21,580 --> 00:31:23,480
Quiet down! Watch your mouth.

433
00:31:24,179 --> 00:31:25,449
Should we try to get Min Ji to talk?

434
00:31:25,780 --> 00:31:26,949
See if she noticed anything strange?

435
00:31:28,090 --> 00:31:31,159
Sure, she'd totally let Min Ji know about her plans.

436
00:31:31,419 --> 00:31:32,689
She's the great Seo Hye Jin.

437
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:38,029
Be strict about attendance.

438
00:31:38,030 --> 00:31:39,769
We have to reduce makeup classes for absentees as much as possible...

439
00:31:39,770 --> 00:31:41,269
in order to stay energized during the special lecture season.

440
00:31:41,270 --> 00:31:43,969
And I'll be checking your daily work logs for the time being.

441
00:31:46,070 --> 00:31:48,138
I've left it up to you until now,

442
00:31:48,139 --> 00:31:51,040
but I think I should take a look to teach new teachers good habits.

443
00:31:51,379 --> 00:31:53,349
Thoroughly record attendance records, homework completion,

444
00:31:53,350 --> 00:31:55,850
personal progress, test results, and parent conference details...

445
00:31:56,080 --> 00:31:58,850
and report everything to me each day.

446
00:32:00,389 --> 00:32:02,219
I'll assume you've understood me.

447
00:32:03,419 --> 00:32:05,219
- Okay. - Shall we get going now?

448
00:32:07,859 --> 00:32:09,189
Mr. Lee, please see me privately.

449
00:32:20,669 --> 00:32:23,639
What is the percentage of a fling becoming an actual relationship?

450
00:32:23,939 --> 00:32:26,109
How can you measure that in percentages?

451
00:32:26,609 --> 00:32:27,980
Based on your personal experience?

452
00:32:28,909 --> 00:32:30,449
Personal experience...

453
00:32:31,149 --> 00:32:32,149
For me, zero?

454
00:32:33,619 --> 00:32:35,949
We have no time to date. We work on weekends too.

455
00:32:37,689 --> 00:32:38,719
Right?

456
00:32:40,459 --> 00:32:42,859
Why did you come so late? I was waiting the whole time.

457
00:32:46,030 --> 00:32:47,428
I made sure the director took his meds...

458
00:32:47,429 --> 00:32:48,800
and waited until he fell asleep.

459
00:32:49,770 --> 00:32:51,899
That drunk kindergartener.

460
00:32:54,540 --> 00:32:55,540
Jun Ho.

461
00:32:56,240 --> 00:32:57,240
Yes?

462
00:32:58,040 --> 00:32:59,679
I'm going to go to Choisun Academy.

463
00:33:00,550 --> 00:33:01,580
I said I didn't care.

464
00:33:02,820 --> 00:33:05,119
The academy will be quite noisy for a while.

465
00:33:05,280 --> 00:33:06,990
There will be lots of kids who switch academies too.

466
00:33:07,090 --> 00:33:08,718
And you'll hear a lot of negative comments about me...

467
00:33:08,719 --> 00:33:10,990
because of the teachers who will be affected by this.

468
00:33:12,119 --> 00:33:13,829
Envy, jealousy, slander, and rumours...

469
00:33:13,830 --> 00:33:15,429
are the fuel that drives this neighbourhood.

470
00:33:16,399 --> 00:33:19,500
Students, parents, directors, and teachers...

471
00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:21,000
all live on that too.

472
00:33:22,629 --> 00:33:25,000
Just ignore everything you hear.

473
00:33:26,070 --> 00:33:27,139
I'm not sure I can do that.

474
00:33:28,939 --> 00:33:30,639
And we'll stay like we were before.

475
00:33:31,879 --> 00:33:33,909
- Just on the outside? - On the inside too.

476
00:33:37,419 --> 00:33:38,918
Why must we do that?

477
00:33:38,919 --> 00:33:41,188
- We've already... - Only think about your goals.

478
00:33:41,189 --> 00:33:42,789
Being laid back and going on about your first love...

479
00:33:42,790 --> 00:33:44,419
won't get you everything you want.

480
00:33:45,959 --> 00:33:47,629
Didn't you hear what I said?

481
00:33:47,830 --> 00:33:49,799
I clearly said that my feelings were sincere...

482
00:33:49,800 --> 00:33:52,659
I can only help you out until this semester.

483
00:33:52,760 --> 00:33:55,030
You have to learn everything you can from me until then.

484
00:33:57,740 --> 00:33:59,339
Are you playing hard to get?

485
00:33:59,340 --> 00:34:00,608
Stop playing around.

486
00:34:00,609 --> 00:34:02,639
I think you're the one who's playing around.

487
00:34:03,010 --> 00:34:05,138
You said you wanted to become famous and go somewhere better.

488
00:34:05,139 --> 00:34:07,148
Don't think about anything else and focus.

489
00:34:07,149 --> 00:34:09,280
You doing this makes it harder for me to focus.

490
00:34:10,379 --> 00:34:13,088
I mean, "Why is she acting like this?"

491
00:34:13,089 --> 00:34:15,420
"I thought we were on the same page yesterday."

492
00:34:15,850 --> 00:34:16,959
In the time that I worry about these things,

493
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:18,158
I'd rather work on another test question.

494
00:34:18,159 --> 00:34:19,219
Lower your voice.

495
00:34:19,259 --> 00:34:21,789
I'm saying keeping your personal life nice and neat is important too.

496
00:34:21,790 --> 00:34:22,860
But we...

497
00:34:24,730 --> 00:34:26,270
What isn't neat about us?

498
00:34:28,330 --> 00:34:29,669
Are you tacky enough to care about our age difference?

499
00:34:29,670 --> 00:34:30,670
Being a teacher and student in the past?

500
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:34,008
I mean, do you think these things will become obstacles for us?

501
00:34:34,009 --> 00:34:35,069
Are you...

502
00:34:38,779 --> 00:34:41,049
- I've said everything I have to. - Well, I haven't.

503
00:34:44,080 --> 00:34:46,150
Oh, you were here, Mr. Lee.

504
00:34:46,389 --> 00:34:48,619
A student is here from Heewon High.

505
00:34:49,690 --> 00:34:50,718
I see.

506
00:34:50,719 --> 00:34:52,290
- I think you should come and see. - Okay.

507
00:34:54,730 --> 00:34:55,759
Go.

508
00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:11,940
- The teacher is here. Go on. - Thank you.

509
00:35:13,350 --> 00:35:14,409
Hey, Si Woo.

510
00:35:15,310 --> 00:35:16,350
Good to see you.

511
00:35:17,279 --> 00:35:19,080
What's up? The lessons start next week.

512
00:35:19,690 --> 00:35:20,719
Oh, right.

513
00:35:32,360 --> 00:35:33,770
Here. It's what you asked for.

514
00:35:33,900 --> 00:35:35,230
Oh, your notes?

515
00:35:35,969 --> 00:35:37,299
You didn't have to give me these already.

516
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:40,569
You need to prepare as well.

517
00:35:42,369 --> 00:35:43,839
You're really something.

518
00:35:45,810 --> 00:35:46,880
Who's this?

519
00:35:49,480 --> 00:35:51,150
Hello. I'm Lee Si Woo.

520
00:35:51,420 --> 00:35:52,420
I know that.

521
00:35:52,421 --> 00:35:55,290
I was upset I didn't see you for the consultation last time.

522
00:35:55,619 --> 00:35:56,659
Were you?

523
00:35:57,960 --> 00:35:58,960
Yes.

524
00:35:59,830 --> 00:36:00,860
Your class.

525
00:36:01,889 --> 00:36:04,600
Out of all the Korean classes I'd heard so far,

526
00:36:05,860 --> 00:36:07,069
it was the best.

527
00:36:09,029 --> 00:36:10,270
I'll remember it for a long time.

528
00:36:12,440 --> 00:36:13,440
What...

529
00:36:15,509 --> 00:36:16,610
What an honour.

530
00:36:19,279 --> 00:36:22,350
You won't be able to teach like that all the time.

531
00:36:23,679 --> 00:36:24,719
That day...

532
00:36:27,190 --> 00:36:29,859
You braced for humiliation on a planetary level.

533
00:36:29,860 --> 00:36:30,860
Right.

534
00:36:34,489 --> 00:36:37,699
Still, I'd like to listen to another class like that.

535
00:36:43,199 --> 00:36:46,569
Oh, I need you to make copies of my notes right now.

536
00:36:47,409 --> 00:36:49,069
- I have to go to math class. - Oh, okay.

537
00:36:49,509 --> 00:36:50,710
- Let's go that way. - Okay.

538
00:36:51,880 --> 00:36:53,009
See you in class.

539
00:36:53,210 --> 00:36:55,179
- Okay. See you next week. - Sure.

540
00:36:56,779 --> 00:36:58,279
Why didn't you tell me that?

541
00:37:00,089 --> 00:37:01,889
Why would I say that to another guy?

542
00:37:43,560 --> 00:37:44,600
Gosh.

543
00:37:47,330 --> 00:37:48,799
I'd forgotten completely.

544
00:37:52,969 --> 00:37:54,739
The camera symbolizes the main character's idea,

545
00:37:55,639 --> 00:37:57,779
and the combat boots symbolize the main character's reality.

546
00:38:19,659 --> 00:38:22,369
Ms. Seo. Don't you have a class?

547
00:38:23,670 --> 00:38:24,670
Right.

548
00:38:54,900 --> 00:38:56,670
Let's talk after work. I'll wait.

549
00:38:57,369 --> 00:38:59,809
Let's not. I don't have the capacity to argue with you today.

550
00:38:59,810 --> 00:39:02,069
Great. Then let's not argue.

551
00:39:02,770 --> 00:39:04,710
Forget the silly options and calculations...

552
00:39:05,009 --> 00:39:06,679
and tell me how you really feel.

553
00:39:07,310 --> 00:39:08,850
I'll accept it without complaint.

554
00:39:09,610 --> 00:39:11,250
Why won't you listen?

555
00:39:11,520 --> 00:39:12,580
Were you always like this?

556
00:39:12,650 --> 00:39:14,219
- Ms. Seo. - Ms. Seo?

557
00:39:14,489 --> 00:39:15,549
I'm coming.

558
00:39:19,190 --> 00:39:20,190
Sorry.

559
00:39:21,889 --> 00:39:22,929
Let's go.

560
00:39:52,690 --> 00:39:56,159
I wish all Daechi-dong instructors were like you.

561
00:39:58,659 --> 00:39:59,659
What?

562
00:40:01,699 --> 00:40:03,600
I think I could beat everyone, then.

563
00:40:05,270 --> 00:40:06,299
As if.

564
00:40:07,710 --> 00:40:10,139
We start next week, and you seem to have time to kill.

565
00:40:11,739 --> 00:40:12,810
You're mistaken.

566
00:40:13,980 --> 00:40:15,179
That's good to know.

567
00:40:20,020 --> 00:40:23,290
I wouldn't stand a chance if everyone were like Ms. Seo.

568
00:40:25,759 --> 00:40:27,960
I don't think she slept much last night.

569
00:40:29,630 --> 00:40:31,159
Is she taking wild ginseng?

570
00:40:31,929 --> 00:40:33,630
Her fridge was bare.

571
00:40:43,739 --> 00:40:47,879
(Samseong-ro)

572
00:40:47,880 --> 00:40:50,880
(Daechi Chase)

573
00:40:53,290 --> 00:40:54,290
Thank you.

574
00:40:54,989 --> 00:40:56,960
- Thank you. - Bye.

575
00:41:02,929 --> 00:41:04,159
What's the matter?

576
00:41:05,699 --> 00:41:06,699
Sorry.

577
00:41:07,429 --> 00:41:08,569
I have a headache.

578
00:41:08,730 --> 00:41:10,469
Shall I get you some medicine?

579
00:41:11,940 --> 00:41:13,509
No. Let's go upstairs.

580
00:41:14,170 --> 00:41:15,368
Good job, Min Ji.

581
00:41:15,369 --> 00:41:17,278
Thanks. You did a good job too.

582
00:41:17,279 --> 00:41:18,279
Thanks.

583
00:41:19,380 --> 00:41:20,409
I'll do that.

584
00:41:22,179 --> 00:41:23,779
- Leave this up. - Okay.

585
00:41:27,089 --> 00:41:28,089
I'm off, then.

586
00:41:36,330 --> 00:41:37,360
Ms. Seo.

587
00:41:37,699 --> 00:41:39,000
You didn't leave?

588
00:41:39,730 --> 00:41:40,900
As you can see.

589
00:41:41,969 --> 00:41:44,600
Sorry. I really don't have the energy to fight.

590
00:41:47,509 --> 00:41:48,810
Then use me as a driver.

591
00:41:50,810 --> 00:41:53,380
I won't say anything. I'll just drive.

592
00:41:55,409 --> 00:41:56,449
Give me the car key.

593
00:42:20,770 --> 00:42:25,139
(Daechi Station)

594
00:42:37,659 --> 00:42:38,719
Do you have a headache?

595
00:42:39,860 --> 00:42:41,290
You said you wouldn't talk.

596
00:42:50,900 --> 00:42:51,940
Where are we going?

597
00:42:53,540 --> 00:42:55,610
I can't send you home when you're not well.

598
00:42:56,679 --> 00:42:58,639
I'll hang around until you feel better.

599
00:43:31,509 --> 00:43:34,049
Why do you have a headache?

600
00:43:40,219 --> 00:43:41,350
I'll get some medicine.

601
00:43:41,520 --> 00:43:42,750
It's fine. Leave it.

602
00:43:44,159 --> 00:43:46,319
No. I'll be really quick.

603
00:43:46,719 --> 00:43:47,830
I got punched.

604
00:43:51,659 --> 00:43:52,900
What do you mean?

605
00:43:53,299 --> 00:43:56,199
Who? When? At the academy?

606
00:43:57,540 --> 00:43:59,639
No. It was Si Woo.

607
00:44:01,440 --> 00:44:02,440
What?

608
00:44:07,150 --> 00:44:08,210
Ms. Seo.

609
00:44:10,350 --> 00:44:13,520
"Out of all the Korean classes I'd heard so far, it was the best."

610
00:44:14,250 --> 00:44:15,920
"I'll remember it for a long time."

611
00:44:17,759 --> 00:44:19,289
As soon as he said that,

612
00:44:19,290 --> 00:44:21,460
my head felt like it would split apart.

613
00:44:22,130 --> 00:44:23,290
It hurt so bad.

614
00:44:26,659 --> 00:44:28,199
That wasn't our lecture.

615
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:30,199
It was Si Woo's.

616
00:44:30,670 --> 00:44:32,170
I didn't think of that.

617
00:44:34,639 --> 00:44:36,638
I lured a 16-year-old over...

618
00:44:36,639 --> 00:44:38,579
only to think of my pay and vice-director position.

619
00:44:38,580 --> 00:44:41,649
When I think of that... My gosh.

620
00:44:41,650 --> 00:44:42,980
I feel so embarrassed and pathetic.

621
00:44:44,619 --> 00:44:45,850
I wanted to die.

622
00:44:48,319 --> 00:44:49,319
Gosh.

623
00:44:50,460 --> 00:44:51,520
You're right.

624
00:44:54,159 --> 00:44:55,159
Yes.

625
00:44:57,060 --> 00:44:58,330
Let's get some air.

626
00:44:59,100 --> 00:45:00,600
I need to hear more about Si Woo.

627
00:45:01,770 --> 00:45:03,299
The wind is cold outside.

628
00:45:05,069 --> 00:45:06,540
I need to wake up.

629
00:45:10,210 --> 00:45:12,540
He didn't pay tuition at Choisun Academy?

630
00:45:13,549 --> 00:45:15,509
He cared most about our scholarship program.

631
00:45:16,949 --> 00:45:18,920
He gave that up to come to you and me.

632
00:45:20,150 --> 00:45:22,750
He even said he went up against Choi Hyung Sun one-to-one.

633
00:45:25,520 --> 00:45:27,459
He seemed to have explained pretty well...

634
00:45:27,460 --> 00:45:28,489
why he would switch.

635
00:45:31,100 --> 00:45:32,159
This is insane.

636
00:45:34,770 --> 00:45:37,069
We really have to pluck him the moon and stars, then.

637
00:45:38,199 --> 00:45:39,199
Yes.

638
00:45:40,239 --> 00:45:42,310
He can't go back to Choisun Academy now.

639
00:45:42,770 --> 00:45:43,839
He can't.

640
00:45:45,139 --> 00:45:46,480
Then I can't go either.

641
00:45:48,009 --> 00:45:49,449
I don't think that's a wise decision.

642
00:45:51,279 --> 00:45:53,889
I clung to your pant legs and asked you to stay too,

643
00:45:54,790 --> 00:45:56,690
but you must know I did that for personal reasons.

644
00:45:59,360 --> 00:46:01,259
I can teach him well on my own.

645
00:46:01,929 --> 00:46:04,060
I'm working real hard prepping for the class,

646
00:46:05,029 --> 00:46:06,699
so you should grab your opportunity.

647
00:46:07,670 --> 00:46:09,029
You said it was a shocking offer.

648
00:46:09,969 --> 00:46:11,040
You're acting...

649
00:46:13,069 --> 00:46:14,210
quite cheeky with me.

650
00:46:15,069 --> 00:46:17,109
- What? - If I go to Choisun Academy,

651
00:46:17,110 --> 00:46:18,539
how hard do you think I'd work?

652
00:46:18,540 --> 00:46:20,278
Do you think you can even focus on Heewon High?

653
00:46:20,279 --> 00:46:22,080
I'll poach all your Chanyoung High students.

654
00:46:23,009 --> 00:46:25,719
Then Daechi Chase will invest all they have to put on a defence.

655
00:46:26,779 --> 00:46:28,520
Do you have to throw down the gauntlet?

656
00:46:28,719 --> 00:46:30,088
I might love money a lot,

657
00:46:30,089 --> 00:46:32,219
but isn't it wrong to do that to Si Woo?

658
00:46:33,389 --> 00:46:36,130
Plus, I think he preferred my lecture to yours.

659
00:46:37,600 --> 00:46:38,900
No way.

660
00:46:39,730 --> 00:46:41,730
I want to teach him until he graduates.

661
00:46:44,139 --> 00:46:45,969
Teaching a smart kid.

662
00:46:47,170 --> 00:46:49,170
It's more awesome than you think.

663
00:47:00,520 --> 00:47:02,089
You make me look like a loser.

664
00:47:05,819 --> 00:47:07,190
If you switch things around like this...

665
00:47:09,630 --> 00:47:11,060
"I like you."

666
00:47:13,159 --> 00:47:14,569
"Consider me a man."

667
00:47:16,500 --> 00:47:17,770
"Let's date."

668
00:47:20,199 --> 00:47:22,509
It would look bad to say that now.

669
00:47:23,369 --> 00:47:24,409
Let's go home.

670
00:47:24,880 --> 00:47:26,080
But keep it in mind.

671
00:47:28,080 --> 00:47:29,310
That I like you.

672
00:47:31,449 --> 00:47:34,290
Even when the hottest girl in school asked me out,

673
00:47:35,319 --> 00:47:36,350
Seo Hye Jin...

674
00:47:37,159 --> 00:47:38,460
was all I could think of.

675
00:47:42,230 --> 00:47:43,460
Just don't push me away.

676
00:47:45,060 --> 00:47:48,170
When I was stone-cold sober. When I hadn't fallen in the water.

677
00:47:49,369 --> 00:47:50,869
I told you very clearly.

678
00:47:54,210 --> 00:47:55,409
You...

679
00:47:56,670 --> 00:48:00,210
How can you say things like that with zero embarrassment?

680
00:48:02,480 --> 00:48:04,080
Because I've been practising since I was Si Woo's age.

681
00:48:21,969 --> 00:48:23,069
Do you need something?

682
00:48:23,869 --> 00:48:25,069
Wait just a moment.

683
00:49:17,989 --> 00:49:19,259
What's all this for?

684
00:49:20,889 --> 00:49:23,830
I heard your fridge was bare.

685
00:49:24,900 --> 00:49:26,159
According to Ms. Nam.

686
00:49:26,659 --> 00:49:27,830
My goodness.

687
00:49:30,299 --> 00:49:31,940
Do you come to this store often?

688
00:49:32,270 --> 00:49:34,540
- Yes. - Good.

689
00:49:36,770 --> 00:49:38,110
I'm moving in upstairs.

690
00:49:40,710 --> 00:49:42,509
- Why? - I signed the lease.

691
00:49:44,480 --> 00:49:46,719
When I put my mind to something, I get it done. You know that, right?

692
00:51:12,339 --> 00:51:14,170
("A Raw Youth" by Dostoevsky)

693
00:51:35,989 --> 00:51:38,698
Mount Seorak was busy early this morning with hikers...

694
00:51:38,699 --> 00:51:40,730
ready to enjoy the peak fall foliage.

695
00:51:40,869 --> 00:51:42,429
Min Hye Jin has the story.

696
00:51:45,440 --> 00:51:47,408
Between the ridges,

697
00:51:47,409 --> 00:51:49,468
you can see the colourful fall colours...

698
00:51:49,469 --> 00:51:51,380
lining the landscape.

699
00:51:51,540 --> 00:51:52,880
Did you sleep well?

700
00:51:53,639 --> 00:51:54,650
Good morning, Mom.

701
00:51:55,880 --> 00:51:56,980
What do you do today?

702
00:51:57,980 --> 00:51:59,020
Work, of course.

703
00:51:59,679 --> 00:52:01,089
After breakfast...

704
00:52:01,389 --> 00:52:02,889
Shall we go hiking together?

705
00:52:05,259 --> 00:52:06,859
The brightly coloured trees...

706
00:52:06,860 --> 00:52:09,259
This is what a dad who sent three sons...

707
00:52:09,630 --> 00:52:11,029
to prestigious universities does now.

708
00:52:11,860 --> 00:52:12,860
What?

709
00:52:13,360 --> 00:52:15,900
Don't you remember I was busiest on weekends in school?

710
00:52:18,540 --> 00:52:20,610
Lee Jun Ho. Make it up to me.

711
00:52:20,969 --> 00:52:25,139
- I got you into college. - I brought in all the money.

712
00:52:26,310 --> 00:52:27,850
Anyway, I'm busiest on weekends now.

713
00:52:34,319 --> 00:52:35,449
Oh, and...

714
00:52:37,119 --> 00:52:39,290
- I move out next month. - Already?

715
00:52:41,060 --> 00:52:44,159
Mother. Can you put down the knife when we talk?

716
00:52:45,529 --> 00:52:47,259
Do you have to move out?

717
00:52:48,199 --> 00:52:49,500
Where will you go?

718
00:52:49,670 --> 00:52:52,239
This neighbourhood's too expensive, so I'm going a bit further out.

719
00:52:53,139 --> 00:52:55,869
Isn't it easier to get to and from work from here?

720
00:52:56,969 --> 00:52:59,778
I'll give you the address. Come by when I've settled in.

721
00:52:59,779 --> 00:53:03,210
We talked for the duration of the walk that reached 15m.

722
00:53:04,580 --> 00:53:07,079
The continued climb made them breathless,

723
00:53:07,080 --> 00:53:09,920
but it's precious family time.

724
00:53:10,690 --> 00:53:12,689
I hadn't been able to...

725
00:53:12,690 --> 00:53:14,659
(Banapresso)

726
00:53:39,179 --> 00:53:40,790
Seo Hye Jin.

727
00:53:41,420 --> 00:53:42,449
Hey.

728
00:53:46,460 --> 00:53:47,630
What's this feel?

729
00:53:48,889 --> 00:53:49,960
What feel?

730
00:53:50,929 --> 00:53:52,299
Never mind.

731
00:53:53,860 --> 00:53:56,170
You look a bit different from usual.

732
00:53:58,770 --> 00:54:00,909
I ordered something with honey for your hangover.

733
00:54:00,969 --> 00:54:02,009
Drink that.

734
00:54:02,469 --> 00:54:03,869
Good for you.

735
00:54:04,409 --> 00:54:06,080
- Do you like the choice? - Yes.

736
00:54:10,650 --> 00:54:12,619
I want to drink and hang out with you too.

737
00:54:13,880 --> 00:54:15,319
How can you say that?

738
00:54:16,290 --> 00:54:19,489
You're the one who's too busy to make the time.

739
00:54:21,589 --> 00:54:22,690
Get to the point.

740
00:54:23,360 --> 00:54:25,600
- You have to get back. - Oh, yes.

741
00:54:27,830 --> 00:54:28,830
Here.

742
00:54:28,831 --> 00:54:31,469
Mr. Lee, your order's ready.

743
00:54:32,969 --> 00:54:33,969
What's this for?

744
00:54:34,239 --> 00:54:35,540
A token of my appreciation.

745
00:54:36,069 --> 00:54:38,440
Thanks for going over my contract.

746
00:54:39,540 --> 00:54:40,880
Pay me in cash.

747
00:54:41,850 --> 00:54:44,448
I bought clothes to wear when I tag along...

748
00:54:44,449 --> 00:54:45,520
to the contract signing.

749
00:54:47,619 --> 00:54:49,048
It's so cold and formal.

750
00:54:49,049 --> 00:54:51,619
You're always so exact when it comes to favours.

751
00:54:52,489 --> 00:54:53,989
I feel bad.

752
00:54:56,589 --> 00:54:59,000
I won't go to Choisun Academy.

753
00:54:59,730 --> 00:55:00,730
What?

754
00:55:03,730 --> 00:55:04,770
Why not?

755
00:55:05,739 --> 00:55:07,639
There's a kid I want to teach.

756
00:55:11,810 --> 00:55:13,509
That's a reason I never heard before.

757
00:55:14,580 --> 00:55:16,179
Because of one student,

758
00:55:16,549 --> 00:55:18,520
you'll give up that amazing offer?

759
00:55:19,250 --> 00:55:20,420
You're an academy instructor.

760
00:55:21,449 --> 00:55:23,250
I made the human choice.

761
00:55:24,119 --> 00:55:27,060
Isn't it more human to choose money?

762
00:55:28,589 --> 00:55:31,199
Is it a choice a teacher should make, then?

763
00:55:31,759 --> 00:55:32,830
That sounds too grand.

764
00:55:33,299 --> 00:55:35,270
Let's just call it a sentimental choice.

765
00:55:36,770 --> 00:55:37,940
Is that it?

766
00:55:40,699 --> 00:55:41,710
What?

767
00:55:41,940 --> 00:55:43,040
Last time,

768
00:55:43,639 --> 00:55:46,040
you said you were hesitant to leave.

769
00:55:47,040 --> 00:55:48,150
Is that unrelated?

770
00:55:51,080 --> 00:55:52,080
It's unrelated.

771
00:55:52,779 --> 00:55:53,850
Okay.

772
00:55:55,219 --> 00:55:57,690
You know I'm on standby 24-7, right?

773
00:55:59,089 --> 00:56:01,489
Call me any time if you want to talk.

774
00:56:03,259 --> 00:56:04,259
Okay.

775
00:56:06,500 --> 00:56:09,529
(Choisun Academy)

776
00:56:11,869 --> 00:56:15,069
I didn't expect a visit when there are so many people.

777
00:56:16,540 --> 00:56:19,009
I didn't think it would matter if I had nothing to hide.

778
00:56:19,739 --> 00:56:20,739
Okay.

779
00:56:22,779 --> 00:56:25,219
You and I both have to start our day soon,

780
00:56:25,580 --> 00:56:27,589
so I'll say my part and then leave.

781
00:56:29,989 --> 00:56:32,489
First, thank you very much for the great offer.

782
00:56:34,529 --> 00:56:38,060
If I must say so myself, I put a lot of thought into it.

783
00:56:38,759 --> 00:56:39,929
I could tell.

784
00:56:40,699 --> 00:56:42,929
It was the best offer I'd received,

785
00:56:43,400 --> 00:56:46,600
and the terms were concise. I'm full of respect for you.

786
00:56:48,409 --> 00:56:50,610
I realized again there was so much...

787
00:56:51,310 --> 00:56:52,540
I could learn from you.

788
00:56:57,110 --> 00:56:58,679
What I want to say is,

789
00:56:59,619 --> 00:57:02,319
the reasoning for my decision has nothing to do...

790
00:57:02,920 --> 00:57:04,150
with what you offered.

791
00:57:12,929 --> 00:57:15,029
I'll remain at my current academy.

792
00:58:01,250 --> 00:58:04,250
(Choisun Academy)

793
00:58:07,889 --> 00:58:08,920
Hey.

794
00:58:12,190 --> 00:58:13,190
Sorry.

795
00:58:15,060 --> 00:58:16,060
Ms. Seo.

796
00:58:16,259 --> 00:58:17,799
We met at a weird place.

797
00:58:18,199 --> 00:58:19,299
Why are you here?

798
00:58:22,069 --> 00:58:23,130
What about you?

799
00:58:23,600 --> 00:58:26,868
I came to meet an instructor I knew.

800
00:58:26,869 --> 00:58:27,909
What about you?

801
00:58:29,639 --> 00:58:31,080
I came to return my textbook.

802
00:58:32,080 --> 00:58:34,610
It was free because it was included in the scholarship.

803
00:58:35,350 --> 00:58:36,380
I see.

804
00:58:38,980 --> 00:58:40,250
Shall I wait?

805
00:58:44,690 --> 00:58:45,719
Why?

806
00:58:45,889 --> 00:58:47,929
I could buy you a soda or something.

807
00:58:50,460 --> 00:58:52,000
I have an English class right after.

808
00:58:52,560 --> 00:58:54,100
Oh, right. Yes.

809
00:58:55,500 --> 00:58:56,670
See you next week, then.

810
00:58:57,069 --> 00:58:58,839
- Okay. - Go ahead.

811
00:59:06,839 --> 00:59:07,849
Hi.

812
00:59:07,850 --> 00:59:10,278
(Famously Korean)

813

(Strategic Special Lecture)

814
00:59:18,819 --> 00:59:21,159
Why are you calling this early, Mr. Lee?

815
00:59:21,860 --> 00:59:23,190
What's this about?

816
00:59:24,460 --> 00:59:26,130
Did my call cheer you up?

817
00:59:27,929 --> 00:59:28,969
Where are you?

818
00:59:52,219 --> 00:59:53,259
You could've stayed there.

819
01:00:05,670 --> 01:00:07,000
Why are you in a good mood?

820
01:00:07,299 --> 01:00:08,540
Why did you want to see me?

821
01:00:09,310 --> 01:00:11,710
Ms. Oh Jeong Hwa made gimbap.

822
01:00:12,040 --> 01:00:13,610
Let's eat together before work.

823
01:00:14,779 --> 01:00:17,549
I want to hurry to work.

824
01:00:18,520 --> 01:00:19,549
Why?

825
01:00:20,049 --> 01:00:21,190
I want to study.

826
01:00:22,319 --> 01:00:23,319
What?

827
01:00:24,420 --> 01:00:25,819
I met Si Woo.

828
01:00:28,060 --> 01:00:29,159
By chance.

829
01:00:30,560 --> 01:00:33,158
How ashamed, embarrassed, and horrible would I have felt...

830
01:00:33,159 --> 01:00:34,698
if I had moved to Choisun?

831
01:00:34,699 --> 01:00:36,170
Just the thought gives me chills.

832
01:00:37,429 --> 01:00:40,270
I made a great decision.

833
01:00:40,699 --> 01:00:41,710
That's what I thought.

834
01:00:43,139 --> 01:00:44,810
You're full of love and praise for yourself.

835
01:00:46,040 --> 01:00:48,150
I'm in such a darn great mood.

836
01:00:48,610 --> 01:00:49,710
A darn great mood?

837
01:00:50,580 --> 01:00:52,480
You say stuff like that?

838
01:00:54,819 --> 01:00:56,020
You were right.

839
01:00:59,420 --> 01:01:00,960
For once in a long time,

840
01:01:03,159 --> 01:01:04,560
I like myself a lot.

(The Midnight Romance in Hagwon)

842
01:01:41,569 --> 01:01:43,968
I didn't want to go to an empty home today.

843
01:01:43,969 --> 01:01:45,199
You feel lonely too?

844
01:01:45,440 --> 01:01:47,469
Wouldn't it be better to be with her?

845
01:01:47,699 --> 01:01:50,138
Could you see all my lies?

846
01:01:50,139 --> 01:01:51,210
You're dating her?

847
01:01:51,239 --> 01:01:53,480
But you had a crush on her years ago.

848
01:01:53,540 --> 01:01:54,849
Address her respectfully, you lunatic.

849
01:01:54,850 --> 01:01:55,879
It's a secret.

850
01:01:55,880 --> 01:01:57,079
If people find out about us,

851
01:01:57,080 --> 01:01:58,649
I won't have a say in anything like scheduling and so on.

852
01:01:58,650 --> 01:02:00,380
We got stabbed in the back before.

853
01:02:00,520 --> 01:02:03,389
You want me to take the leftovers?

854
01:02:03,850 --> 01:02:06,619
Can you not fall for Jun Ho?

855
01:02:08,389 --> 01:02:10,860
My patience has gone completely.
