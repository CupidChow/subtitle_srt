(Episode 6)

7
00:00:57,120 --> 00:00:58,459
Let's go.

8
00:01:01,529 --> 00:01:04,159
Min Ji, can you finish cleaning up for me?

9
00:01:04,160 --> 00:01:05,999
Yes, sure. Hurry upstairs.

10
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:08,339
I can't wait to find out about the Heewon kid.

11
00:01:44,910 --> 00:01:46,668
(Consultation Room 2)

12
00:01:46,669 --> 00:01:47,978
Hello.

13
00:01:47,979 --> 00:01:49,009
Hi.

14
00:01:53,979 --> 00:01:56,449
- Hi. - Is your class over?

15
00:01:56,679 --> 00:01:59,619
Yes. Is Mr. Lee not here?

16
00:01:59,789 --> 00:02:00,850
He went home.

17
00:02:02,220 --> 00:02:03,389
With the director?

18
00:02:03,390 --> 00:02:04,929
No, they all left separately.

19
00:02:05,330 --> 00:02:06,330
I see.

20
00:02:09,660 --> 00:02:10,660
By the way.

21
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,139
Congratulations on the Heewon class.

22
00:02:16,139 --> 00:02:17,199
Thank you.

23
00:02:22,239 --> 00:02:24,280
(Consultation Room 2)

24
00:02:48,669 --> 00:02:52,739
(Ms. Seo)

25
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:22,900
Where are you?

26
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:31,310
Are you asleep?

27
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:54,600
Ms. Seo.

28
00:04:07,180 --> 00:04:08,280
Where were you at?

29
00:04:10,479 --> 00:04:11,789
I was out getting some air.

30
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:16,019
You'll talk much more from now on.

31
00:04:16,259 --> 00:04:17,319
Beware of colds.

32
00:04:17,930 --> 00:04:19,690
Go out for air when the weather's nice.

33
00:04:23,100 --> 00:04:24,570
Do you have anything to say to me?

34
00:04:25,700 --> 00:04:28,299
Why not share how you feel, Mr. Lee?

35
00:04:31,070 --> 00:04:33,070
How does it feel to meet your first student?

36
00:04:35,539 --> 00:04:36,580
For Si Woo,

37
00:04:37,479 --> 00:04:39,510
I feel like I can pluck him the moon and stars.

38
00:04:41,010 --> 00:04:43,419
Promise a first-class grade, not something that is impossible.

39
00:04:45,689 --> 00:04:46,720
What's the matter?

40
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:49,489
Are you scared now that you met your first charge?

41
00:04:51,229 --> 00:04:53,459
It's fine. There's time until the class starts,

42
00:04:53,460 --> 00:04:55,129
- so if you prepare well... - Ms. Seo.

43
00:04:55,460 --> 00:04:56,499
Go on.

44
00:04:57,129 --> 00:04:58,570
I take back everything I said earlier.

45
00:04:59,900 --> 00:05:02,140
Choisun Academy. You can go.

46
00:05:05,939 --> 00:05:07,270
Gosh.

47
00:05:07,609 --> 00:05:10,309
You said I could take over all the students you brought in.

48
00:05:10,510 --> 00:05:11,779
You don't want to anymore?

49
00:05:11,780 --> 00:05:13,479
- It's not that. - What is it, then?

50
00:05:20,049 --> 00:05:21,720
Si Woo wants to go to Seoul National University.

51
00:05:22,989 --> 00:05:24,688
His family struggles financially,

52
00:05:24,689 --> 00:05:26,160
so the tuition needs to be cheap.

53
00:05:27,900 --> 00:05:29,330
He wants to grow to like Korean.

54
00:05:30,629 --> 00:05:33,070
Memorizing passages just to get the answers right makes him nervous.

55
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:37,168
All the adults he knows want him to become a doctor,

56
00:05:37,169 --> 00:05:40,039
and he thinks he should live up to their expectations,

57
00:05:40,869 --> 00:05:42,938
but he's not sure if that's really what he wants.

58
00:05:42,939 --> 00:05:44,010
So...

59
00:05:44,710 --> 00:05:46,279
before he turns 20,

60
00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:48,220
he wants to find what he wants to do.

61
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:51,749
What does that have to do with Choisun Academy?

62
00:05:52,090 --> 00:05:54,220
I want to help Si Woo with everything.

63
00:05:55,220 --> 00:05:56,418
Get him into SNU,

64
00:05:56,419 --> 00:05:57,720
make him like Korean,

65
00:05:58,689 --> 00:05:59,789
and find him a career.

66
00:06:01,660 --> 00:06:02,700
So what?

67
00:06:03,999 --> 00:06:06,129
I wondered if that was how you felt about me.

68
00:06:07,270 --> 00:06:08,270
What about it?

69
00:06:10,570 --> 00:06:11,669
Isn't that wrong?

70
00:06:13,210 --> 00:06:14,639
I left school long ago.

71
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:16,510
We're just colleagues now.

72
00:06:16,710 --> 00:06:19,080
Me keeping you here, stopping you from moving.

73
00:06:19,650 --> 00:06:20,910
That's evil.

74
00:06:23,879 --> 00:06:27,119
If you don't want alcohol, shall I bring you tea instead?

75
00:06:27,689 --> 00:06:29,019
I dried bell-flower at home...

76
00:06:29,020 --> 00:06:30,858
especially for you teachers.

77
00:06:30,859 --> 00:06:31,859
It's good for the throat.

78
00:06:32,189 --> 00:06:34,660
That sounds nice. Are you okay with hot tea?

79
00:06:36,030 --> 00:06:37,559
- We'll have some. Thanks. - Okay.

80
00:06:40,629 --> 00:06:42,700
Don't go overboard. I'll take care of myself.

81
00:06:44,499 --> 00:06:45,770
What will you do?

82
00:06:47,210 --> 00:06:48,279
Eat your food.

83
00:06:48,280 --> 00:06:50,379
- I don't have to report... - Taking care of yourself.

84
00:06:52,510 --> 00:06:54,379
Does that mean taking a loss to look out for your old student?

85
00:06:56,679 --> 00:06:57,749
What is your problem?

86
00:06:58,919 --> 00:07:00,720
Why did you give up your spot in the advertisements?

87
00:07:05,359 --> 00:07:07,029
More than anything,

88
00:07:07,030 --> 00:07:10,429
I'm so pleased the first student he consulted...

89
00:07:10,530 --> 00:07:12,200
is doing so well in school.

90
00:07:13,129 --> 00:07:14,330
Don't you agree?

91
00:07:15,070 --> 00:07:18,109
One student at the top of his class is worth ten advertisements.

92
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:20,609
Good for you, Mr. Lee.

93
00:07:21,039 --> 00:07:22,080
Thank you.

94
00:07:22,309 --> 00:07:23,379
Well done.

95
00:07:24,410 --> 00:07:26,309
You didn't have much time,

96
00:07:26,510 --> 00:07:29,619
but I'm impressed you managed to prepare to consult a student too.

97
00:07:30,450 --> 00:07:31,489
Thank you.

98
00:07:33,049 --> 00:07:34,590
This is the beginning.

99
00:07:34,859 --> 00:07:37,159
For as long as you're an instructor,

100
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:40,590
today's victorious memory will provide great strength.

101
00:07:41,299 --> 00:07:43,299
Stay this way and never change.

102
00:07:44,129 --> 00:07:45,129
I will.

103
00:07:46,129 --> 00:07:48,400
We should celebrate,

104
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:50,538
but I'm sorry I have prior plans.

105
00:07:50,539 --> 00:07:53,269
That's right. You were on your way out.

106
00:07:53,270 --> 00:07:54,270
Shall we all go?

107
00:07:54,271 --> 00:07:55,439
- Yes. - Let's go.

108
00:07:58,379 --> 00:08:00,679
Mr. Lee, can you stay?

109
00:08:14,189 --> 00:08:15,200
Lee Jun Ho.

110
00:08:22,270 --> 00:08:23,340
Great.

111
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:27,140
You did very well.

112
00:08:28,309 --> 00:08:29,739
You two...

113
00:08:31,140 --> 00:08:32,479
really are the best.

114
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:35,119
Thank you.

115
00:08:35,580 --> 00:08:38,449
As the director here,

116
00:08:38,450 --> 00:08:41,219
I can't do anything that could look like I'm showing favoritism.

117
00:08:41,220 --> 00:08:43,659
- That was so frustrating for me. - I see.

118
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:48,330
I knew we would pull it off.

119
00:08:48,859 --> 00:08:50,800
You know what we three have.

120
00:08:51,060 --> 00:08:52,998
A novice director, a novice instructor,

121
00:08:52,999 --> 00:08:55,868
and you, the knucklehead student.

122
00:08:55,869 --> 00:08:59,070
We shocked Daechi-dong, didn't we?

123
00:09:00,070 --> 00:09:02,440
We're an incredible team.

124
00:09:04,009 --> 00:09:05,550
You can search the whole of Daechi-dong.

125
00:09:06,180 --> 00:09:08,219
You won't find another academy director...

126
00:09:08,220 --> 00:09:09,919
gutsy enough to put...

127
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:12,190
a newbie instructor in the posters.

128
00:09:12,519 --> 00:09:15,358
Any other director wouldn't have...

129
00:09:15,359 --> 00:09:17,460
entertained the offer at all.

130
00:09:19,729 --> 00:09:20,830
What offer?

131
00:09:21,159 --> 00:09:22,200
Come on.

132
00:09:22,930 --> 00:09:26,070
Seo Hye Jin said we could put someone else in the advertisements,

133
00:09:26,529 --> 00:09:28,499
and Lee Jun Ho made our pie bigger.

134
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:31,669
For all your aspirations and challenges,

135
00:09:31,670 --> 00:09:33,570
I was right there offering support.

136
00:09:37,909 --> 00:09:40,050
Our close relationship that formed in the past...

137
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:42,279
brought upon this miracle.

138
00:09:44,749 --> 00:09:46,619
The director must be getting scared.

139
00:09:47,050 --> 00:09:49,420
He wants to insist we're a team.

140
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:50,790
Ms. Seo.

141
00:09:51,060 --> 00:09:52,528
I did it so you'd get noticed...

142
00:09:52,529 --> 00:09:53,889
and get scouted by a bigger academy.

143
00:09:54,190 --> 00:09:56,498
You said you wanted to make lots of money.

144
00:09:56,499 --> 00:09:59,368
I didn't say that expecting your sacrifice or consideration.

145
00:09:59,369 --> 00:10:01,368
That sounds like I'm sacrificing myself...

146
00:10:01,369 --> 00:10:02,868
for the greater good.

147
00:10:02,869 --> 00:10:04,069
It's nothing.

148
00:10:04,070 --> 00:10:05,509
It's not a joke.

149
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:10,040
I felt horribly guilty.

150
00:10:12,710 --> 00:10:14,248
If I were to ask you...

151
00:10:14,249 --> 00:10:16,080
to help me for another year on top of what you did,

152
00:10:16,820 --> 00:10:18,350
isn't that just stupid?

153
00:10:20,190 --> 00:10:21,859
Don't go overboard.

154
00:10:22,659 --> 00:10:25,189
I take back everything I said earlier.

155
00:10:25,190 --> 00:10:28,399
Just do what you want, okay?

156
00:10:35,470 --> 00:10:37,269
I have nothing more to teach you.

157
00:10:38,409 --> 00:10:39,940
I'm not kidding. It's not funny.

158
00:10:40,139 --> 00:10:42,439
You found your first student, and now you're being thoughtful.

159
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:45,680
Don't call me thoughtful and act like you're the only adult.

160
00:10:47,909 --> 00:10:48,920
My gosh.

161
00:10:50,680 --> 00:10:51,790
That hurts.

162
00:10:54,619 --> 00:10:55,619
Why?

163
00:10:59,090 --> 00:11:00,489
Why does that hurt?

164
00:11:02,659 --> 00:11:04,529
I guess I liked how you said you needed me.

165
00:11:08,239 --> 00:11:11,070
We're always waiting, hoping to be chosen.

166
00:11:11,399 --> 00:11:13,869
There are so many academies and instructors.

167
00:11:14,210 --> 00:11:16,278
So we shout until we're hoarse.

168
00:11:16,279 --> 00:11:17,608
"I'm right here."

169
00:11:17,609 --> 00:11:19,850
"Please come and listen to me."

170
00:11:20,180 --> 00:11:22,878
But you came to me voluntarily...

171
00:11:22,879 --> 00:11:24,479
and told me you needed me.

172
00:11:25,090 --> 00:11:26,719
You suggested we go on an adventure,

173
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:28,859
and I guess that made me really happy.

174
00:11:29,460 --> 00:11:31,590
So when you told me to go, I felt...

175
00:11:32,129 --> 00:11:33,759
Upset? Was that what I felt?

176
00:11:41,330 --> 00:11:42,399
Ms. Seo. You're...

177
00:11:44,570 --> 00:11:45,609
a real headache.

178
00:11:46,670 --> 00:11:47,670
What?

179
00:11:49,479 --> 00:11:51,080
What am I to do if you do this?

180
00:12:29,779 --> 00:12:31,420
What am I to do if you do this?

181
00:12:35,090 --> 00:12:36,090
I don't know.

182
00:13:08,149 --> 00:13:11,590
(Ms. Seo: Are you...)

183
00:13:29,210 --> 00:13:30,210
Who's there?

184
00:13:31,479 --> 00:13:32,479
Go back to sleep.

185
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:33,609
Okay.

(Instructor Lee Jun Ho)

190
00:15:48,279 --> 00:15:51,679
(Daechi Chase opens Heewon High class.)

191
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:54,820
(The Final Miracle! Seo Hye Jin, Lee Jun Ho)

192
00:16:00,389 --> 00:16:04,159
Director Kim Hyun Tak is quite smart.

193
00:16:05,269 --> 00:16:06,830
What are you talking about?

194
00:16:08,070 --> 00:16:11,840
I stayed late to help with the consultations.

195
00:16:12,639 --> 00:16:14,310
He asked to see me before he left.

196
00:16:16,639 --> 00:16:17,679
Did he?

197
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:19,080
Yes. He gave me...

198
00:16:20,450 --> 00:16:23,079
the headline to put on our new banner,

199
00:16:23,080 --> 00:16:24,450
then went out to drink.

200
00:16:26,590 --> 00:16:29,460
While we were all jumping for joy,

201
00:16:29,690 --> 00:16:32,359
he was busy coming up with that in a corner of his brain.

202
00:16:33,330 --> 00:16:35,629
It felt oddly uncomfortable.

203
00:16:39,330 --> 00:16:42,339
Moving half a second before others do...

204
00:16:42,340 --> 00:16:44,340
is his specialty.

205
00:16:45,269 --> 00:16:46,839
Look at what he accomplished...

206
00:16:46,840 --> 00:16:48,210
while other small academies went under.

207
00:16:48,710 --> 00:16:51,879
Don't look down on him because he acts like he's clueless.

208
00:16:53,109 --> 00:16:55,009
You should watch and learn.

209
00:16:56,279 --> 00:16:59,749
It's not something you can learn, you know.

210
00:17:01,249 --> 00:17:03,259
It's more of an instinct.

211
00:17:04,159 --> 00:17:06,960
A middle-aged woman like me can't even copy him.

212
00:17:08,959 --> 00:17:12,929
I scheduled the Heewon High class for Wednesday evenings.

213
00:17:13,330 --> 00:17:17,070
I don't think we need a Sunday class yet.

214
00:17:18,810 --> 00:17:20,939
What about the Chanyoung High 11th grade class?

215
00:17:22,580 --> 00:17:25,679
Shall I give it back to Ms. Seo?

216
00:17:25,980 --> 00:17:27,010
Leave it for now.

217
00:17:32,290 --> 00:17:35,189
I'm sure the director will talk to...

218
00:17:35,590 --> 00:17:36,760
Ms. Seo, right?

219
00:17:38,990 --> 00:17:41,060
(Honam Diner)

220
00:17:46,330 --> 00:17:47,330
Over here.

221
00:17:48,230 --> 00:17:50,369
- Did you wait a while? - Not really.

222
00:17:50,899 --> 00:17:52,709
I ordered for us already.

223
00:17:52,939 --> 00:17:54,369
I got your usual.

224
00:17:55,740 --> 00:17:57,510
- I have one? - You do.

225
00:17:58,909 --> 00:17:59,909
Thanks.

226
00:18:03,820 --> 00:18:04,879
Thank you.

227
00:18:09,389 --> 00:18:10,419
That's for her.

228
00:18:10,689 --> 00:18:12,989
Oh, is it? Here you go.

229
00:18:12,990 --> 00:18:15,129
Okay. Thanks.

230
00:18:20,429 --> 00:18:21,770
Here we go.

231
00:18:23,369 --> 00:18:24,369
I have to teach.

232
00:18:24,639 --> 00:18:26,909
Your class is five hours away.

233
00:18:27,540 --> 00:18:29,678
That's long enough to sober up after half a shot.

234
00:18:29,679 --> 00:18:31,240
Let's do what we used to do.

235
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:40,549
Is it too humble a meal...

236
00:18:40,550 --> 00:18:42,419
to offer a victorious general?

237
00:18:43,119 --> 00:18:44,159
It's fine.

238
00:18:46,060 --> 00:18:48,929
I thought of taking you to a fancy restaurant,

239
00:18:49,899 --> 00:18:51,629
but then I remembered this place.

240
00:18:51,969 --> 00:18:53,999
I was in the area a few days ago...

241
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,840
and saw they were still in business.

242
00:18:57,439 --> 00:18:58,439
Okay.

243
00:18:59,369 --> 00:19:01,638
You know we don't have many classrooms to go around.

244
00:19:01,639 --> 00:19:03,539
I was looking around to see if I could...

245
00:19:03,540 --> 00:19:05,480
rent a couple of classrooms to use next year.

246
00:19:05,909 --> 00:19:09,379
I heard our old academy spot was available, so I came by.

247
00:19:09,919 --> 00:19:10,980
Then...

248
00:19:12,449 --> 00:19:14,189
I didn't sign the contract because I had a bad feeling.

249
00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:18,388
Two instructors fell in love and stuff happened,

250
00:19:18,389 --> 00:19:20,459
and the academy crashed.

251
00:19:21,359 --> 00:19:23,929
The instructors got jealous and badmouthed each other.

252
00:19:24,199 --> 00:19:27,600
The students caught wind, and the rumors turned dirty.

253
00:19:29,070 --> 00:19:30,839
Once a few started to leave,

254
00:19:30,840 --> 00:19:32,439
there was no stopping the exodus.

255
00:19:34,709 --> 00:19:38,040
If you think about it, it's hard to have...

256
00:19:38,379 --> 00:19:40,810
a life as clean as yours, Ms. Seo.

257
00:19:40,949 --> 00:19:42,919
Both at work and in private.

258
00:19:46,250 --> 00:19:47,290
What?

259
00:19:47,449 --> 00:19:50,359
I'm going to keep it clean, both at work and in private.

260
00:19:50,990 --> 00:19:51,990
Goodness.

261
00:19:58,030 --> 00:19:59,570
Oh, let's eat.

262
00:20:10,909 --> 00:20:11,980
Gosh.

263
00:20:21,919 --> 00:20:24,289
Does your younger brother...

264
00:20:24,290 --> 00:20:26,030
still live with your parents?

265
00:20:26,359 --> 00:20:27,389
Yes.

266
00:20:29,300 --> 00:20:30,829
It must be quite a commute...

267
00:20:30,830 --> 00:20:32,270
all the way to Sejong City.

268
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:35,300
He'll save up and move out, I'm sure.

269
00:20:36,840 --> 00:20:38,909
Time really flies.

270
00:20:39,639 --> 00:20:42,079
It feels as if it were yesterday that you paid his tuition.

271
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:43,810
Now he's a civil servant.

272
00:20:55,490 --> 00:20:58,959
I'm sure Jun Ho told you everything last night.

273
00:20:59,290 --> 00:21:00,359
He did.

274
00:21:01,629 --> 00:21:04,800
It brought back memories of the old days.

275
00:21:06,030 --> 00:21:07,330
It showed.

276
00:21:08,030 --> 00:21:09,399
If you think about it,

277
00:21:10,270 --> 00:21:13,739
when we both reached turning points in our lives,

278
00:21:13,740 --> 00:21:16,340
Jun Ho was always there.

279
00:21:16,639 --> 00:21:17,639
That's true.

280
00:21:20,649 --> 00:21:22,449
I'd taken out a loan to make movies,

281
00:21:23,020 --> 00:21:24,520
and you two helped me pay it all back.

282
00:21:25,689 --> 00:21:27,820
I swore something...

283
00:21:29,219 --> 00:21:31,919
when we moved out of this building.

284
00:21:33,659 --> 00:21:35,899
That I'd never fail again.

285
00:21:36,929 --> 00:21:40,070
That I wouldn't let those who trust and follow me suffer.

286
00:21:40,429 --> 00:21:42,939
I told myself that was what a leader should do.

287
00:21:46,810 --> 00:21:49,939
I was so afraid of failure...

288
00:21:50,510 --> 00:21:53,449
that I did something to you that I shouldn't have.

289
00:21:55,179 --> 00:21:57,149
The Gangbuk branch was keeping me up at night.

290
00:21:57,879 --> 00:22:00,449
An unfamiliar city, unfamiliar schools.

291
00:22:01,090 --> 00:22:03,359
Students who are entirely different from the Daechi-dong kids.

292
00:22:04,760 --> 00:22:08,358
How were we to take root in that environment?

293
00:22:08,359 --> 00:22:11,300
Who of us could do that successfully?

294
00:22:12,570 --> 00:22:13,669
That's why...

295
00:22:14,570 --> 00:22:16,000
I got impatient.

296
00:22:16,840 --> 00:22:19,709
I was too busy trying to give you an important task.

297
00:22:21,439 --> 00:22:22,740
I forgot how we'd gotten started.

298
00:22:26,780 --> 00:22:29,580
You can hire a personal teaching assistant.

299
00:22:30,149 --> 00:22:33,219
This person will be separate from the TA...

300
00:22:33,449 --> 00:22:34,850
you already have.

301
00:22:34,949 --> 00:22:38,290
The academy will cover the salary.

302
00:22:39,429 --> 00:22:41,129
I teach fewer classes now.

303
00:22:41,389 --> 00:22:42,600
I don't need another TA.

304
00:22:42,629 --> 00:22:44,030
Come on.

305
00:22:44,530 --> 00:22:48,600
Do accept a sincere apology from your director.

306
00:22:49,639 --> 00:22:52,070
Will you teach the Chanyoung High grade 11 kids again?

307
00:22:53,609 --> 00:22:55,580
Let's agree over a shot.

308
00:22:59,050 --> 00:23:01,109
I felt horribly guilty.

309
00:23:02,149 --> 00:23:03,780
- Director. - Yes?

310
00:23:04,750 --> 00:23:06,490
That's not how you apologize.

311
00:23:07,419 --> 00:23:09,119
Even I feel embarrassed.

312
00:23:11,719 --> 00:23:13,060
Oh, wait.

313
00:23:13,560 --> 00:23:15,559
If you're worried about what...

314
00:23:15,560 --> 00:23:18,198
Mr. Lee and Ms. Nam will think, don't worry about them.

315
00:23:18,199 --> 00:23:20,000
Jun Ho will have to...

316
00:23:20,100 --> 00:23:22,639
focus on his Heewon High class,

317
00:23:22,899 --> 00:23:26,169
and Ms. Nam will be assigned an appropriate class.

318
00:23:26,510 --> 00:23:30,079
I realized again that I need you and your amazing teaching skills...

319
00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:31,708
at our main branch in Daechi-dong...

320
00:23:31,709 --> 00:23:34,109
to back up the whole operation.

321
00:23:34,609 --> 00:23:36,718
I see now that's the only way...

322
00:23:36,719 --> 00:23:38,990
our academy will grow.

323
00:23:39,649 --> 00:23:42,189
I understand that you're upset.

324
00:23:42,560 --> 00:23:44,059
I apoo, I apologize...

325
00:23:44,060 --> 00:23:45,520
I'm stuttering now.

326
00:23:46,129 --> 00:23:48,490
If my apology wasn't good enough, once again, I...

327
00:23:48,730 --> 00:23:50,060
I'm not saying it wasn't good enough.

328
00:23:50,429 --> 00:23:52,270
I'm saying it was done wrong.

329
00:23:55,899 --> 00:23:57,199
Is that too hard to grasp?

330
00:23:57,540 --> 00:23:59,510
I'm known for making things simple.

331
00:24:00,810 --> 00:24:03,240
Come on now. Ms. Seo.

332
00:24:07,179 --> 00:24:09,079
Seo Hye Jin.

333
00:24:09,080 --> 00:24:11,820
What you shattered wasn't my Chanyoung High class.

334
00:24:11,980 --> 00:24:13,449
It was our trust.

335
00:24:13,850 --> 00:24:16,059
Come on. That's not right.

336
00:24:16,060 --> 00:24:17,290
Don't exaggerate.

337
00:24:17,689 --> 00:24:20,029
Both you and Ms. Woo have been...

338
00:24:20,030 --> 00:24:21,490
feeling uneasy for about five years.

339
00:24:21,590 --> 00:24:22,929
I knew all about it.

340
00:24:30,639 --> 00:24:31,639
Hello?

341
00:24:32,810 --> 00:24:34,369
Yes, I'm Seo Hye Jin.

342
00:24:39,109 --> 00:24:40,149
Yes.

343
00:24:41,310 --> 00:24:43,050
What about it, then?

344
00:24:44,419 --> 00:24:45,550
How did you get my number?

345
00:24:47,119 --> 00:24:49,060
Oh, I see.

346
00:24:49,590 --> 00:24:50,990
I heard of the place.

347
00:24:56,330 --> 00:24:58,329
No. I wouldn't bother meeting up.

348
00:24:58,330 --> 00:25:00,030
Even a fool could've noticed.

349
00:25:00,800 --> 00:25:02,398
The exact same day...

350
00:25:02,399 --> 00:25:05,869
another academy called me, you would mention our long-time...

351
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:07,569
friendship and loyalty.

352
00:25:07,570 --> 00:25:08,980
But I didn't care.

353
00:25:09,040 --> 00:25:12,849
I even thought, "Oh, did I fail to make them trust me?"

354
00:25:12,850 --> 00:25:15,280
That's why I agreed to any deal you offered me.

355
00:25:15,550 --> 00:25:18,580
The more I read this clause, the more I hate it.

356
00:25:19,820 --> 00:25:21,350
If you quit this academy,

357
00:25:21,389 --> 00:25:23,919
you can't go to or start an academy in the same area for a year.

358
00:25:24,859 --> 00:25:26,189
It doesn't happen all the time,

359
00:25:26,629 --> 00:25:28,830
but you might have to pay them compensation.

360
00:25:29,230 --> 00:25:30,300
Do you know that?

361
00:25:30,830 --> 00:25:32,398
I won't move, so it doesn't matter.

362
00:25:32,399 --> 00:25:34,230
I'll sign it if there are no other problems.

363
00:25:35,770 --> 00:25:37,739
Ever since you put my face in the ads,

364
00:25:37,740 --> 00:25:39,469
I stopped jaywalking.

365
00:25:39,869 --> 00:25:42,039
In case word got out and I ruined our reputation,

366
00:25:42,040 --> 00:25:43,138
I didn't even curse.

367
00:25:43,139 --> 00:25:44,480
- Ms. Seo. - Yes!

368
00:25:45,040 --> 00:25:46,379
I did that out of gratitude.

369
00:25:46,609 --> 00:25:48,080
You helped me when I needed it.

370
00:25:49,350 --> 00:25:51,379
But none of that was free.

371
00:25:51,580 --> 00:25:53,850
My brother's tuition? My dad's treatment?

372
00:25:54,689 --> 00:25:55,858
You paid me in advance,

373
00:25:55,859 --> 00:25:57,689
and I made up for it. Nothing was a favor.

374
00:25:57,790 --> 00:25:59,889
Why talk like I was a charity case?

375
00:26:00,260 --> 00:26:03,060
I guess I said something that you took the wrong way.

376
00:26:03,129 --> 00:26:04,959
You did upset and offend me,

377
00:26:05,459 --> 00:26:08,899
but still, I thought we had a decent relationship.

378
00:26:10,899 --> 00:26:13,070
You said I was more important than a few students.

379
00:26:14,010 --> 00:26:15,469
I believed that.

380
00:26:18,810 --> 00:26:21,378
I watched our academy grow and even found pride in it.

381
00:26:21,379 --> 00:26:24,250
I guess you thought it was all you.

382
00:26:25,119 --> 00:26:26,490
This is insane.

383
00:26:28,350 --> 00:26:30,119
Don't act like you're so noble.

384
00:26:30,719 --> 00:26:32,990
You wanted the title of youngest Gangbuk branch director!

385
00:26:33,159 --> 00:26:34,389
I'm glad you said that.

386
00:26:34,859 --> 00:26:36,060
Is the Gangbuk branch mine?

387
00:26:36,659 --> 00:26:38,000
Can I grow it and then keep it?

388
00:26:38,230 --> 00:26:39,399
I said I was scared!

389
00:26:39,830 --> 00:26:41,000
Director Kim Hyun Tak!

390
00:26:41,969 --> 00:26:43,600
Can't you just be honest?

391
00:26:44,540 --> 00:26:45,639
It's not a lie.

392
00:26:47,810 --> 00:26:48,810
What?

393
00:26:50,209 --> 00:26:51,439
I really was scared.

394
00:26:55,080 --> 00:26:57,850
Do you know how many nightmares I had of you...

395
00:26:57,949 --> 00:26:59,619
leaving and taking the Chanyoung kids with you?

396
00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:02,619
I pay you a fortune and a half.

397
00:27:02,689 --> 00:27:05,759
For working 15-hours days 7 days a week.

398
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:07,489
Why have you changed so much?

399
00:27:07,490 --> 00:27:08,490
Come on.

400
00:27:08,629 --> 00:27:10,799
Ask a hundred academy directors...

401
00:27:10,800 --> 00:27:12,429
if they wouldn't be scared of you.

402
00:27:12,600 --> 00:27:14,230
I haven't changed.

403
00:27:14,300 --> 00:27:16,039
I've only become a director.

404
00:27:16,040 --> 00:27:18,138
You said you were different from other directors!

405
00:27:18,139 --> 00:27:20,408
See? You talk right back at me!

406
00:27:20,409 --> 00:27:22,480
Will you take the fight outside?

407
00:27:23,639 --> 00:27:24,780
Goodness.

408
00:27:26,280 --> 00:27:27,280
Darn it.

409
00:27:29,219 --> 00:27:30,250
Gosh.

410
00:27:31,919 --> 00:27:34,250
When the day was to come for us to part,

411
00:27:36,560 --> 00:27:38,618
I hoped for a beautiful farewell.

412
00:27:38,619 --> 00:27:41,529
I said I was sorry.

413
00:27:41,530 --> 00:27:43,929
Why would you say something as dreadful as that?

414
00:27:44,129 --> 00:27:45,129
The Chanyoung grade 11 class...

415
00:27:45,130 --> 00:27:47,569
will go to Mr. Lee and Ms. Nam as planned.

416
00:27:47,570 --> 00:27:49,899
They are working hard to prepare for class.

417
00:27:51,899 --> 00:27:52,969
But...

418
00:27:59,609 --> 00:28:00,679
Darn it.

(Chanyoung High School)

422
00:28:11,359 --> 00:28:13,290
You teach grade 11.

423
00:28:14,459 --> 00:28:16,399
I'd like to know why you're involved in...

424
00:28:17,230 --> 00:28:18,530
putting together the grade ten exam.

425
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:24,240
For three years until last year,

426
00:28:24,439 --> 00:28:26,239
I put together the grade ten exam.

427
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:27,668
I know the trend...

428
00:28:27,669 --> 00:28:29,939
and the direction it should go in.

429
00:28:32,439 --> 00:28:34,149
You don't create exam questions for fun.

430
00:28:35,080 --> 00:28:36,780
And you don't teach grade ten now.

431
00:28:38,280 --> 00:28:41,189
The headteacher of our year asked him to help us out.

432
00:28:43,959 --> 00:28:47,330
Some extra feedback would put us at ease.

433
00:28:50,560 --> 00:28:51,599
Put you at ease?

434
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:54,198
I'm not saying you should pick...

435
00:28:54,199 --> 00:28:55,969
whatever questions I come up with.

436
00:29:00,540 --> 00:29:01,810
Know that I appreciate the thought.

437
00:29:08,780 --> 00:29:10,379
He's always so stubborn.

438
00:29:14,149 --> 00:29:15,149
Excuse me.

439
00:29:15,619 --> 00:29:17,719
I'll take any pack of cigarettes and a lighter.

440
00:29:18,689 --> 00:29:20,159
I'm afraid we don't sell them...

441
00:29:22,060 --> 00:29:23,659
due to parents' complaints.

442
00:29:28,300 --> 00:29:31,139
Mr. Pyo's becoming a problem, isn't he?

443
00:29:35,709 --> 00:29:37,209
I hear you, so go back to your work.

444
00:29:38,179 --> 00:29:39,179
Sure.

445
00:30:24,560 --> 00:30:27,730
I'm sorry, but may I ask for a cigarette?

446
00:30:28,429 --> 00:30:29,429
You see,

447
00:30:30,300 --> 00:30:31,629
it's been a while since I quit.

448
00:30:36,070 --> 00:30:37,439
- Here. - Thank you.

00:30:41,139 --> 00:30:42,139

I'll put my trust in you, Mr. Lee.

00:31:59,020 --> 00:32:01,149
Sure. Please ask Jae Young to come by sometime.

455
00:32:01,449 --> 00:32:02,618
I thank you in advance.

456
00:32:02,619 --> 00:32:03,919
- I'll do my best. - Right.

457
00:32:04,290 --> 00:32:06,090
Have a safe trip home.

458
00:32:10,800 --> 00:32:11,830
Wait.

459
00:32:13,629 --> 00:32:15,000
How come you're not intimidated?

460
00:32:16,899 --> 00:32:18,070
I don't have the time for that.

461
00:32:18,270 --> 00:32:19,270
I see.

462
00:32:20,469 --> 00:32:21,540
How about a cup of tea?

463
00:32:22,669 --> 00:32:23,709
Sure.

464
00:32:23,909 --> 00:32:24,980
This way.

465
00:32:26,810 --> 00:32:28,480
The mothers...

466
00:32:29,080 --> 00:32:30,879
sometimes bring me good quality tea.

467
00:32:31,750 --> 00:32:33,850
When their kids get better grades, that is.

468
00:32:35,090 --> 00:32:36,520
But when their grades go down,

469
00:32:38,689 --> 00:32:40,929
I get an earful in return.

470
00:32:44,230 --> 00:32:46,800
- Thank you. - The tea's quite good.

471
00:32:51,300 --> 00:32:53,339
It must be because they live in Gangnam.

472
00:32:53,340 --> 00:32:54,810
They have fine taste.

473
00:32:58,179 --> 00:32:59,280
Judging by how you say that,

474
00:32:59,850 --> 00:33:01,909
one might think you're not one of them.

475
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:03,480
Why you...

476
00:33:06,050 --> 00:33:08,819
Anyway, I don't know...

477
00:33:08,820 --> 00:33:12,389
if it's okay for me to keep addressing you comfortably...

478
00:33:13,230 --> 00:33:16,499
when you've become the rising star of this academy.

479
00:33:16,500 --> 00:33:19,100
Gosh. Please keep treating me that way.

480
00:33:20,070 --> 00:33:21,699
- Thanks for saying so. - The pleasure's mine.

481
00:33:24,169 --> 00:33:25,969
Goodness.

482
00:33:28,939 --> 00:33:31,139
This field...

483
00:33:31,709 --> 00:33:33,149
is pretty heartless, isn't it?

484
00:33:37,379 --> 00:33:38,419
Well,

485
00:33:39,719 --> 00:33:41,749
even I've been in the business...

486
00:33:41,750 --> 00:33:44,060
for about 5 to 6 years now,

487
00:33:45,219 --> 00:33:48,530
but it's nothing like what I had expected.

488
00:33:49,330 --> 00:33:51,230
I feel as though...

489
00:33:51,429 --> 00:33:53,969
all academy instructors would be quite lonely.

490
00:33:54,869 --> 00:33:57,040
They have no one to lean on...

491
00:33:58,169 --> 00:34:00,010
or someone to blindly trust.

492
00:34:06,850 --> 00:34:08,909
About Ms. Seo...

493
00:34:10,020 --> 00:34:12,350
Recent events must've hurt her badly.

494
00:34:14,619 --> 00:34:15,650
Yes.

495
00:34:16,259 --> 00:34:19,460
I don't know how she exactly feels, but this hurt her a lot.

496
00:34:19,860 --> 00:34:22,389
Of course it would have.

497
00:34:22,860 --> 00:34:26,270
Even my heart dropped when I heard about the Chanyoung High class...

498
00:34:26,630 --> 00:34:29,429
being given to another instructor.

499
00:34:36,610 --> 00:34:38,880
Will she renew her contract?

500
00:34:42,679 --> 00:34:44,650
I'm afraid that I don't know.

501
00:34:45,650 --> 00:34:47,089
Should I ask her?

502
00:34:48,619 --> 00:34:50,960
What? Gosh, no.

503
00:34:50,989 --> 00:34:52,460
That's not what I was implying.

504
00:34:57,230 --> 00:34:58,330
Anyway,

505
00:35:00,130 --> 00:35:01,799
Ms. Seo...

506
00:35:02,630 --> 00:35:06,409
came to work at an academy when she was just over 20 years old.

507
00:35:07,170 --> 00:35:10,440
If you think about it, she was just a kid back then.

508
00:35:12,580 --> 00:35:13,580
When I first...

509
00:35:14,210 --> 00:35:16,979
went to see her for a consultation after your mom recommended her,

510
00:35:16,980 --> 00:35:19,790
I could barely call her an instructor or teacher.

511
00:35:22,150 --> 00:35:23,159
I felt the same way.

512
00:35:23,389 --> 00:35:24,420
Right?

513
00:35:26,489 --> 00:35:30,000
How many years has it been since then?

514
00:35:30,699 --> 00:35:32,999
For over ten years she's been coming to work...

515
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:35,199
and preparing students for exams and tests.

516
00:35:37,069 --> 00:35:38,199
Because of that,

517
00:35:38,969 --> 00:35:40,909
she hasn't been able to learn how to be shrewd...

518
00:35:41,940 --> 00:35:44,009
or enjoy the good things in life.

519
00:35:45,880 --> 00:35:46,909
You're right.

520
00:35:47,779 --> 00:35:51,520
It dawned on me that it might be terrifying...

521
00:35:52,250 --> 00:35:54,949
to get on the wrong side of someone like her.

522
00:35:58,119 --> 00:35:59,520
Ms. Kim, when will you run one yourself?

523
00:36:00,929 --> 00:36:01,960
What?

524
00:36:02,360 --> 00:36:03,759
Seoung Gyu told me...

525
00:36:04,060 --> 00:36:05,559
that when his father approves,

526
00:36:05,560 --> 00:36:06,928
you'll hire an academy director...

527
00:36:06,929 --> 00:36:08,699
and run one of your own.

528
00:36:12,739 --> 00:36:13,770
Gosh.

529
00:36:16,909 --> 00:36:20,710
Unbelievable. But that's how sons are, I guess.

530
00:36:23,449 --> 00:36:25,380
They are clueless about their mothers.

531
00:36:29,319 --> 00:36:30,860
What I'm waiting for...

532
00:36:31,589 --> 00:36:33,659
isn't his father's approval.

533
00:36:35,589 --> 00:36:37,400
It's a capable academy director.

534
00:36:42,199 --> 00:36:43,600
He or she must be top-notch...

535
00:36:43,770 --> 00:36:45,698
to tick all the boxes for you.

536
00:36:45,699 --> 00:36:46,869
Of course.

537
00:36:47,940 --> 00:36:49,069
That person...

538
00:36:50,839 --> 00:36:53,610
should at least be as capable as Ms. Seo...

539
00:36:54,710 --> 00:36:55,880
for me to be interested.

540
00:36:56,080 --> 00:36:58,020
(Consultation Room)

541
00:37:07,159 --> 00:37:08,690
It seems like everyone wants a piece of Hye Jin.

542
00:37:12,929 --> 00:37:14,000
Hey, Mr. Lee.

543
00:37:15,170 --> 00:37:16,699
It's been hard to catch you today.

544
00:37:16,969 --> 00:37:18,400
Didn't consultations end long ago?

545
00:37:18,600 --> 00:37:19,940
Where were you?

546
00:37:20,739 --> 00:37:22,440
- Were you looking for me? - Of course.

547
00:37:22,739 --> 00:37:24,409
How can you have time to fool around?

548
00:37:24,610 --> 00:37:25,679
I haven't been fooling around.

549
00:37:26,610 --> 00:37:27,880
I'll see you guys there.

550
00:37:31,179 --> 00:37:32,380
Let's go to the library.

551
00:37:32,719 --> 00:37:34,549
We need to put together material for Heewon High's students.

552
00:37:35,089 --> 00:37:36,859
I'll get it done for my section,

553
00:37:36,860 --> 00:37:38,759
so review it later on. You're busy enough.

554
00:37:40,330 --> 00:37:42,758
Even if Si Woo brings all his friends,

555
00:37:42,759 --> 00:37:45,000
the number of students will barely make the cut.

556
00:37:45,730 --> 00:37:47,500
With small-scale classes, individual care is key.

557
00:37:47,799 --> 00:37:49,100
You still have a lot to learn.

558
00:37:49,529 --> 00:37:51,339
I'll come to you if I have any questions.

559
00:37:59,880 --> 00:38:01,350
I can do well on my own.

560
00:38:12,119 --> 00:38:13,130
Have a seat.

561
00:38:21,900 --> 00:38:22,900
Jun Ho.

562
00:38:24,839 --> 00:38:26,270
I'll let you in on a trade secret.

563
00:38:27,869 --> 00:38:28,909
Save it.

564
00:38:29,239 --> 00:38:31,440
I hear that's the same as giving me special treatment.

565
00:38:31,739 --> 00:38:33,679
It's not since you'll soon figure it out.

566
00:38:37,980 --> 00:38:39,619
When you have students of your own,

567
00:38:40,989 --> 00:38:42,420
you'll develop a favorite.

568
00:38:44,020 --> 00:38:45,860
Si Woo will be that student for you.

569
00:38:49,589 --> 00:38:50,929
As for me, you were my favorite.

570
00:38:52,460 --> 00:38:54,399
Seoung Gyu, Ho Jae, and Tae Hyun...

571
00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:56,029
were nice boys,

572
00:38:59,670 --> 00:39:01,040
but you were my favorite.

573
00:39:01,810 --> 00:39:03,279
Don't tell Ms. Kim though.

574
00:39:04,279 --> 00:39:05,610
Well,

575
00:39:06,610 --> 00:39:08,408
that's because my grades improved the most,

576
00:39:08,409 --> 00:39:10,380
and I brought you additional students.

577
00:39:10,480 --> 00:39:11,480
Right.

578
00:39:12,020 --> 00:39:14,719
That's what I thought, but I was wrong.

579
00:39:15,520 --> 00:39:17,219
Even when your grades dropped...

580
00:39:17,489 --> 00:39:19,889
and when the other kids you brought quit the academy,

581
00:39:20,589 --> 00:39:21,630
you...

582
00:39:23,699 --> 00:39:25,000
You were precious to me as is.

583
00:39:27,799 --> 00:39:30,400
I guess that's why I wanted to help you out even more.

584
00:39:30,839 --> 00:39:33,209
That made me say some ridiculous things yesterday...

585
00:39:33,210 --> 00:39:35,139
like being upset with you.

586
00:39:37,009 --> 00:39:40,380
Anyway, forget about it all.

587
00:39:40,580 --> 00:39:43,679
Forget about the gratitude, guilt, and feeling wronged,

588
00:39:43,779 --> 00:39:45,350
and focus on your own goal.

589
00:39:46,049 --> 00:39:49,089
If there's anything you need, I'll help you any way I can.

590
00:39:55,389 --> 00:39:57,000
After we parted ways last night,

591
00:39:58,199 --> 00:39:59,699
I went by your place.

592
00:40:38,770 --> 00:40:40,409
There's something you don't know.

593
00:40:42,540 --> 00:40:43,540
Which is?

594
00:40:43,980 --> 00:40:45,880
You have no idea...

595
00:40:47,650 --> 00:40:49,480
how much I'm holding back.

596
00:40:50,350 --> 00:40:51,980
I'm worried...

597
00:40:53,790 --> 00:40:56,790
you'd get sick of me if I display all my greed.

598
00:40:58,920 --> 00:41:00,960
So leave me when you can.

599
00:41:08,500 --> 00:41:10,100
The kids are already here. Let's go.

600
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:12,500
Anyway, it has to be do or die for you with the Heewon class.

601
00:41:12,540 --> 00:41:14,008
I'm good with you getting ready yourself,

602
00:41:14,009 --> 00:41:15,239
but have me check your work.

603
00:41:19,909 --> 00:41:21,110
I take it you read between the lines.

604
00:41:22,080 --> 00:41:24,079
Unlock the door. Rumors can be the scariest.

605
00:41:24,080 --> 00:41:25,279
Let people talk.

606
00:41:28,750 --> 00:41:29,790
(Room S401)

607
00:41:34,960 --> 00:41:36,758
- Let's get some fried chicken. - That sounds good.

608
00:41:36,759 --> 00:41:37,830
- Right? - Yes.

609
00:41:37,929 --> 00:41:39,500
- Later, we'll... - Sure.

610
00:41:41,529 --> 00:41:42,799
- Hi, Mr. Lee. - Hi, Mr. Lee.

611
00:41:42,929 --> 00:41:44,000
Hey.

612
00:41:45,600 --> 00:41:46,710
Hi, Mr. Lee.

613
00:41:47,909 --> 00:41:50,310
- Hi, Mr. Lee. - Hi, Mr. Lee.

614
00:41:50,480 --> 00:41:52,310
- Hi, Mr. Lee. - Hi, Mr. Lee.

615
00:42:29,909 --> 00:42:31,580
Make time after class today.

616
00:42:32,420 --> 00:42:33,449
Why?

617
00:42:33,520 --> 00:42:35,019
To treat us to celebratory drinks.

618
00:42:35,020 --> 00:42:36,619
You have enough students to open a class.

619
00:42:37,360 --> 00:42:39,759
Gosh, it's nice to have a reason to spend money in a while.

620
00:42:40,690 --> 00:42:43,089
Having prior engagements can't be an excuse today.

621
00:42:43,400 --> 00:42:45,400
You know what'll happen if you make a run for it.

622
00:42:45,830 --> 00:42:46,830
It won't be fun.

623
00:42:47,299 --> 00:42:50,339
It's been a while, but I should show who's the woman of the hour.

624
00:42:50,540 --> 00:42:51,739
- Nice. - Look forward to it.

625
00:43:21,330 --> 00:43:22,500
Mr. Kim.

626
00:43:22,529 --> 00:43:25,040
Gosh, Ms. Woo.

627
00:43:25,069 --> 00:43:27,569
I haven't been able to reach you all day.

628
00:43:28,170 --> 00:43:29,270
What's been going on?

629
00:43:30,880 --> 00:43:31,909
Right.

630
00:43:32,739 --> 00:43:34,810
I'll have a tomato juice. Actually, make that two.

631
00:43:35,949 --> 00:43:37,679
No, I'm good.

632
00:43:38,580 --> 00:43:41,319
I don't want to sober up just yet.

633
00:43:42,750 --> 00:43:45,560
I guess things didn't go well with Ms. Seo.

634
00:43:50,799 --> 00:43:52,029
Ms. Woo.

635
00:43:52,159 --> 00:43:53,670
Yes, go ahead.

636
00:43:55,799 --> 00:43:58,670
Let's change our strategy.

637
00:44:01,170 --> 00:44:04,080
Seo Hye Jin is too big of a fish now.

638
00:44:05,509 --> 00:44:08,080
If we try to slowly take her down,

639
00:44:09,279 --> 00:44:11,519
it might result in 100 students...

640
00:44:11,520 --> 00:44:13,380
easily quitting.

641
00:44:16,089 --> 00:44:17,089
Then, what?

642
00:44:20,089 --> 00:44:23,029
I'm afraid you'll have to answer to her needs...

643
00:44:23,960 --> 00:44:25,460
for the time being.

644
00:44:29,299 --> 00:44:31,239
Will I be sharing the title of vice-director?

645
00:44:31,670 --> 00:44:35,069
As if titles matter at this point.

646
00:44:36,239 --> 00:44:37,880
Make her Head of Faculty if you must.

647
00:44:38,580 --> 00:44:42,549
For now, we must give her everything we can offer.

648
00:44:44,449 --> 00:44:46,380
I can't believe her contract renewal is coming up.

649
00:44:46,619 --> 00:44:47,690
Mr. Kim.

650
00:44:47,949 --> 00:44:49,850
I have a bad feeling about this.

651
00:44:55,529 --> 00:44:58,960
You know, I should get down on my knees.

652
00:45:02,429 --> 00:45:03,739
As if that's necessary.

653
00:45:11,710 --> 00:45:12,980
I can't imagine...

654
00:45:14,049 --> 00:45:15,779
the academy without Hye Jin.

655
00:45:19,219 --> 00:45:20,920
All the alcohol today...

656
00:45:21,489 --> 00:45:23,219
is yours to drink up.

657
00:45:24,420 --> 00:45:26,860
You didn't hang out with us because of that secret project.

658
00:45:27,259 --> 00:45:28,759
- Got it. - Cheers.

659
00:45:30,230 --> 00:45:31,960
I knew it would work out.

660
00:45:32,259 --> 00:45:33,299
Really?

661
00:45:34,600 --> 00:45:36,469
Hi, guys.

662
00:45:38,600 --> 00:45:41,969
I've always wanted to chat with you, Ms. Seo.

663
00:45:42,040 --> 00:45:43,110
Is that so?

664
00:45:47,480 --> 00:45:49,408
Well, Ms. Nam...

665
00:45:49,409 --> 00:45:51,920
kept gushing over how great your class was.

666
00:45:52,619 --> 00:45:55,850
When did I gush over it? I only mentioned it once.

667
00:45:56,089 --> 00:45:57,089
Cheers.

668
00:45:57,090 --> 00:45:58,988
Why are you people...

669
00:45:58,989 --> 00:46:01,230
cramped up over there?

670
00:46:01,290 --> 00:46:02,928
Send over Mr. Lee or the one who's paying...

671
00:46:02,929 --> 00:46:04,830
to balance out the scales.

672
00:46:04,860 --> 00:46:06,798
- He's right. It's upsetting. - Got it.

673
00:46:06,799 --> 00:46:07,999
Mr. Lee, stay.

674
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:09,900
They're heavy drinkers, so you'll be out cold.

675
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:11,069
Ms. Seo, wouldn't...

676
00:46:11,770 --> 00:46:12,969
Isn't it the same for you?

677
00:46:13,170 --> 00:46:14,310
Who'll force me to drink?

678
00:46:14,909 --> 00:46:15,909
All right.

679
00:46:16,170 --> 00:46:18,278
- Here you go. - Gosh.

680
00:46:18,279 --> 00:46:20,079
Let me take that for you.

681
00:46:20,080 --> 00:46:22,080
Please make sure they don't run out of food.

682
00:46:22,310 --> 00:46:24,379
You should've done this when I was offering discounts.

683
00:46:24,380 --> 00:46:25,949
- Who cares when I buy? - I'll take that.

684
00:46:26,279 --> 00:46:28,189
- Here's our food. - Let's enjoy.

685
00:46:28,190 --> 00:46:31,159
What the... Does he know that we gathered without him?

686
00:46:31,819 --> 00:46:32,989
As if.

687
00:46:34,830 --> 00:46:36,130
Ms. Seo.

688
00:46:36,429 --> 00:46:38,299
- Here. - Ms. Seo.

689
00:46:38,460 --> 00:46:39,698
You're getting a call.

690
00:46:39,699 --> 00:46:41,600
Leave it. I can't be bothered with calls at this hour.

691
00:46:42,170 --> 00:46:43,429
It's the director.

692
00:46:45,239 --> 00:46:46,239
- Just a second. - Sure.

693
00:47:07,630 --> 00:47:09,759
Hye Jin, wait.

694
00:47:13,500 --> 00:47:14,900
What is it? What's going on?

695
00:47:15,100 --> 00:47:17,139
I should at least see Mr. Kim get in a cab.

696
00:47:18,239 --> 00:47:20,408
- Unbelievable. - Head back inside.

697
00:47:20,409 --> 00:47:21,968
I almost forgot. I'll leave my card with you.

698
00:47:21,969 --> 00:47:23,778
- Don't. I'll take care of it. - It's fine.

699
00:47:23,779 --> 00:47:25,178
It's really okay.

700
00:47:25,179 --> 00:47:26,810
But I said I'd be buying.

701
00:47:27,810 --> 00:47:28,850
Here.

702
00:47:29,880 --> 00:47:30,920
I'll get going.

703
00:47:42,759 --> 00:47:43,799
Wait.

704
00:47:48,500 --> 00:47:49,799
Why aren't you at the bar?

705
00:47:52,040 --> 00:47:53,810
You're off to see Director Kim.

706
00:47:55,069 --> 00:47:56,440
Exactly. So what's it to you?

707
00:47:56,569 --> 00:47:59,710
It's weird, you know.

708
00:48:00,409 --> 00:48:02,750
A drunk male boss calling you at this hour?

709
00:48:03,449 --> 00:48:05,549
At a corporate job, this would raise red flags.

710
00:48:07,619 --> 00:48:08,920
What did you tell the others?

711
00:48:10,589 --> 00:48:12,119
I said what I just told you.

712
00:48:14,690 --> 00:48:16,429
- Let's go. - Okay.

713
00:48:19,630 --> 00:48:20,699
Goodness.

714
00:48:22,869 --> 00:48:25,239
The director apologized to me this afternoon.

715
00:48:25,500 --> 00:48:27,468
But I didn't accept his apology. Instead, I went ballistic.

716
00:48:27,469 --> 00:48:28,710
This is probably about that.

717
00:48:30,610 --> 00:48:31,610
You went what?

718
00:48:33,339 --> 00:48:34,380
I went ballistic.

719
00:48:35,480 --> 00:48:37,279
Who knew I would be using foul language because of him?

720
00:48:42,850 --> 00:48:43,860
You'll probably...

721
00:48:44,960 --> 00:48:45,989
join Choisun Academy now.

722
00:48:50,159 --> 00:48:52,460
Where are you, Mr. Kim? I'm here.

723
00:48:55,069 --> 00:48:56,100
I see.

724
00:48:56,830 --> 00:49:00,069
Yes. Please wait a bit. I'm almost there. Okay.

725
00:49:00,839 --> 00:49:02,868
You wait here. Okay?

726
00:49:02,869 --> 00:49:04,310
No. I'll go with you.

727
00:49:04,339 --> 00:49:06,809
Gosh. If something happens to me, I'll scream.

728
00:49:06,810 --> 00:49:07,810
He's right there. There's no need.

729
00:49:09,850 --> 00:49:10,949
How am I going to get down, though?

730
00:49:11,679 --> 00:49:12,750
Through here, I guess.

731
00:49:15,089 --> 00:49:16,989
Wait. Hey, be careful.

732
00:49:18,159 --> 00:49:19,520
- I'm good. - Be careful.

733
00:49:20,889 --> 00:49:21,960
- Gosh. - Watch out.

734
00:49:33,810 --> 00:49:34,869
Sir.

735
00:49:39,540 --> 00:49:41,850
Hey, Hye Jin.

736
00:49:42,549 --> 00:49:45,880
My beautiful gem, Hye Jin.

737
00:49:46,850 --> 00:49:48,850
Gosh, why did you drink so much?

738
00:49:49,089 --> 00:49:50,690
Have you been drinking since this afternoon?

739
00:49:51,119 --> 00:49:52,119
I've been drinking.

740
00:49:52,790 --> 00:49:55,060
I also smoked a cigarette which I hadn't done for a long time.

741
00:49:57,130 --> 00:49:58,560
Should I go and buy you some water?

742
00:49:59,400 --> 00:50:00,500
I don't need that.

743
00:50:04,540 --> 00:50:06,969
The wind is quite chilly. Okay? Let's get up.

744
00:50:08,610 --> 00:50:10,310
I'm a coward.

745
00:50:11,810 --> 00:50:13,980
Let's go home now. We can talk about this tomorrow.

746
00:50:14,080 --> 00:50:16,380
On top of that, I'm mean.

747
00:50:16,909 --> 00:50:18,520
I didn't say you were mean.

748
00:50:18,880 --> 00:50:21,319
What? Then...

749
00:50:21,790 --> 00:50:25,119
am I a cunning and cruel director who plots dirty tricks?

750
00:50:25,589 --> 00:50:27,489
Gosh, don't talk harshly about yourself.

751
00:50:27,830 --> 00:50:30,088
Sir, I merely wanted a sincere apology from you...

752
00:50:30,089 --> 00:50:32,330
for dismissing my long-standing loyalty. I mean it.

753
00:50:33,659 --> 00:50:35,569
Right. An apology.

754
00:50:36,830 --> 00:50:38,940
That was today's theme.

755
00:50:40,069 --> 00:50:41,770
Gosh. He's driving me crazy.

756
00:50:46,810 --> 00:50:49,210
Don't talk about me like I'm pathetic or something!

757
00:50:51,319 --> 00:50:54,020
Gosh, Mr. Kim. I'll get going now.

758
00:50:54,619 --> 00:50:56,349
- Wait. No. - I can't stay here any longer.

759
00:50:56,350 --> 00:50:58,588
No. Please sit down here.

760
00:50:58,589 --> 00:51:00,729
- No. - Come on. Sit here for a second.

761
00:51:00,730 --> 00:51:01,988
Sir, be careful.

762
00:51:01,989 --> 00:51:04,529
- Wait. - The apology...

763
00:51:05,330 --> 00:51:06,360
You know?

764
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:10,940
I'm going to apologize to you from the bottom of my heart.

765
00:51:11,469 --> 00:51:14,239
Accept my heartfelt apology before you go.

766
00:51:15,040 --> 00:51:16,110
Okay?

767
00:51:17,139 --> 00:51:18,279
Wait here.

768
00:51:19,679 --> 00:51:21,679
Gosh, sir. Come on!

769
00:51:22,710 --> 00:51:25,750
Gosh, go over there. Just sit down and watch.

770
00:51:26,179 --> 00:51:27,250
Goodness.

771
00:51:28,719 --> 00:51:31,060
Sit back down! Now!

772
00:51:32,119 --> 00:51:34,690
- Gosh. - Come on. Sit down already.

773
00:51:35,290 --> 00:51:36,830
Sit down now.

774
00:51:38,199 --> 00:51:39,230
Yes, sit.

775
00:51:41,469 --> 00:51:42,529
Goodness.

776
00:51:55,710 --> 00:51:56,750
Oh, my.

777
00:52:00,350 --> 00:52:02,089
Ms. Seo.

778
00:52:03,889 --> 00:52:07,460
I'm sincerely sorry.

779
00:52:09,529 --> 00:52:11,130
Sir, please get up right now.

780
00:52:11,199 --> 00:52:13,199
Let's talk about this rationally. Okay?

781
00:52:13,799 --> 00:52:14,869
Please...

782
00:52:16,299 --> 00:52:17,799
Please!

783
00:52:19,400 --> 00:52:20,500
don't abandon...

784
00:52:22,110 --> 00:52:25,040
me or our academy.

785
00:52:26,540 --> 00:52:27,610
Get up.

786
00:52:28,009 --> 00:52:29,409
Please get up now!

787
00:52:29,880 --> 00:52:33,250
I won't get up until you promise me.

788
00:52:34,549 --> 00:52:35,650
We'll talk about this tomorrow.

789
00:52:36,190 --> 00:52:37,218
Come here.

790
00:52:37,219 --> 00:52:40,159
Come over here. Seriously, come here.

791
00:52:40,319 --> 00:52:41,829
Ms. Seo!

792
00:52:41,830 --> 00:52:43,389
Gosh. No.

793
00:52:44,500 --> 00:52:46,130
- Gosh. - Hey, that's dangerous.

794
00:52:46,360 --> 00:52:47,770
Go over there. No.

795
00:52:48,529 --> 00:52:49,569
What are you doing here?

796
00:52:50,369 --> 00:52:51,369
Hello.

797
00:52:51,370 --> 00:52:54,709
Hey, Jun Ho. What are you doing here?

798
00:52:54,710 --> 00:52:56,239
- Gosh. - I know, right?

799
00:52:58,779 --> 00:53:01,350
- Why don't you get up right now? - What?

800
00:53:01,580 --> 00:53:03,809
- Hey, get away from me! - Goodness.

801
00:53:03,810 --> 00:53:07,250
I won't leave tonight until I clear this up with Hye Jin.

802
00:53:08,089 --> 00:53:09,818
Fine. I'm not stopping you.

803
00:53:09,819 --> 00:53:11,389
But just do it on the spot that's a bit wider.

804
00:53:11,520 --> 00:53:13,658
- Get up, sir. - I told you no!

805
00:53:13,659 --> 00:53:14,960
- Get away from me. - Sir. Gosh.

806
00:53:15,029 --> 00:53:16,089
Oh, dear.

807
00:53:23,069 --> 00:53:24,500
I don't think she's coming back.

808
00:53:25,699 --> 00:53:28,110
He must have thought about Hye Jin when he was having some tasty food.

809
00:53:29,210 --> 00:53:30,509
Kim Hyun Tak does that all the time.

810
00:53:30,679 --> 00:53:33,310
Gosh. You're so petty.

811
00:53:34,380 --> 00:53:36,409
What? This isn't the first time he's done that. You know?

812
00:53:37,049 --> 00:53:38,079
If I were the director,

813
00:53:38,080 --> 00:53:40,020
I wouldn't let her feet touch the ground.

814
00:53:41,449 --> 00:53:43,588
So he buys her expensive food and drinks privately.

815
00:53:43,589 --> 00:53:46,060
- Why are you so jealous about that? - Gosh.

816
00:53:47,360 --> 00:53:48,389
Darn it.

817
00:53:55,299 --> 00:53:56,330
Sir.

818
00:53:57,170 --> 00:53:58,600
This is enough. Please get up.

819
00:53:58,699 --> 00:53:59,869
Your knees must be hurting.

820
00:54:00,400 --> 00:54:02,069
- Please? - I told you I didn't want to.

821
00:54:04,810 --> 00:54:07,449
What if Ms. Seo catches a cold?

822
00:54:09,480 --> 00:54:11,980
- Wait. I can't let that happen. - Right?

823
00:54:12,179 --> 00:54:13,948
- Right. - Right. That can't happen.

824
00:54:13,949 --> 00:54:16,319
So why don't you get up? Grab my arms.

825
00:54:16,549 --> 00:54:18,459
All right. One, two, three.

826
00:54:18,460 --> 00:54:20,759
- Gosh. Be careful. - Oh, my.

827
00:54:21,060 --> 00:54:22,889
- Gosh. Are you okay? - Oh, dear.

828
00:54:26,330 --> 00:54:27,360
Sir!

829
00:54:27,969 --> 00:54:30,969
What just happened? Oh, no!

830
00:54:31,239 --> 00:54:33,040
- What's this? - Oh, no.

831
00:54:33,239 --> 00:54:34,769
- You brute! - Gosh.

832
00:54:34,770 --> 00:54:35,968
- Goodness. - Jun Ho.

833
00:54:35,969 --> 00:54:37,040
What is this?

834
00:54:38,380 --> 00:54:39,380
Are you okay?

835
00:54:39,980 --> 00:54:40,980
Gosh.

836
00:54:42,449 --> 00:54:43,509
I'm okay.

837
00:54:43,850 --> 00:54:45,718
- Gosh. - Be careful.

838
00:54:45,719 --> 00:54:47,549
- My hand... - Hold onto me tightly.

839
00:54:47,850 --> 00:54:48,889
- Your hand... - Let go of me!

840
00:54:50,049 --> 00:54:52,089
- Darn it! - Sir!

841
00:54:52,619 --> 00:54:53,790
Come on!

842
00:54:55,929 --> 00:54:57,060
- What do we do? - Gosh.

843
00:55:01,500 --> 00:55:02,529
Oh, no.

844
00:55:21,489 --> 00:55:23,589
Be careful.

845
00:55:26,020 --> 00:55:27,060
Hello.

846
00:55:28,089 --> 00:55:30,229
Your legs. Pull your legs in.

847
00:55:30,230 --> 00:55:31,929
Gosh. What's this?

848
00:55:32,159 --> 00:55:33,230
I'm sorry.

849
00:55:38,170 --> 00:55:39,940
I'm sorry. Please take good care of him.

850
00:55:41,569 --> 00:55:42,770
Gosh. Okay.

851
00:55:43,310 --> 00:55:44,310
Thank you.

852
00:55:44,639 --> 00:55:47,949
I'm sorry, sir. Please put the heater on high for him.

853
00:55:48,110 --> 00:55:49,110
I'm sorry.

854
00:55:49,111 --> 00:55:51,719
Mr. Lee. Go home quickly.

855
00:55:52,650 --> 00:55:55,250
Okay. Don't worry about me. Just get home safely.

856
00:55:58,159 --> 00:55:59,159
Bye.

857
00:56:08,369 --> 00:56:11,068
Gosh. Oh, no. You must be freezing.

858
00:56:11,069 --> 00:56:12,540
No, I'm good.

859
00:56:13,040 --> 00:56:14,509
- Let me give you my coat. - No.

860
00:56:14,839 --> 00:56:15,969
I'm really okay.

861
00:56:16,839 --> 00:56:17,909
I'm fine.

862
00:56:24,350 --> 00:56:25,619
It's verified.

863
00:56:28,150 --> 00:56:29,448
Go to the teacher's office.

864
00:56:29,449 --> 00:56:31,118
I'll bring the electric heater from the storage.

865
00:56:31,119 --> 00:56:32,989
I have a lap blanket at my desk. Cover yourself with that.

866
00:56:33,560 --> 00:56:35,429
Take your time.

867
00:56:35,560 --> 00:56:36,759
Look at you, acting tough again.

868
00:57:54,069 --> 00:57:55,869
I told you to cover yourself with the blanket.

869
00:57:56,239 --> 00:57:59,509
Gosh, no. My clothes are all wet, so nothing can help right now.

870
00:57:59,710 --> 00:58:00,739
Good grief.

871
00:58:02,250 --> 00:58:04,250
- Wait here. I will... - Hold on. Oh, no.

872
00:58:04,549 --> 00:58:06,079
Don't do that. Your coat will get wet.

873
00:58:06,080 --> 00:58:07,850
- No, put it on you. - No. I'm okay.

874
00:58:08,619 --> 00:58:10,419
Wait then. I'll bring more heaters. We should have a few more.

875
00:58:10,420 --> 00:58:12,219
No. I'm really okay. Seriously.

876
00:58:12,719 --> 00:58:14,258
Your hand is like ice.

877
00:58:14,259 --> 00:58:15,860
Hold on. Let me go and bring something warm.

878
00:58:49,230 --> 00:58:50,429
Hold onto this.

879
00:58:50,589 --> 00:58:51,699
Okay.

880
00:59:02,469 --> 00:59:03,670
Are you still cold?

881
00:59:04,739 --> 00:59:05,739
I'm feeling better.

882
00:59:08,350 --> 00:59:09,810
Gosh, seriously.

883
00:59:12,520 --> 00:59:13,650
Why are you laughing?

884
00:59:18,060 --> 00:59:19,119
Seriously.

885
00:59:21,159 --> 00:59:22,428
I really didn't think...

886
00:59:22,429 --> 00:59:24,360
I would see two grown men fall into the water.

887
00:59:25,759 --> 00:59:28,069
That wasn't even on the list of things I anticipated today.

888
00:59:30,730 --> 00:59:31,869
What do you mean?

889
00:59:34,810 --> 00:59:35,839
Please?

890
00:59:38,779 --> 00:59:40,040
Has it been about ten years?

891
00:59:41,279 --> 00:59:43,080
There hadn't been any variables in my life.

892
00:59:44,009 --> 00:59:45,319
The closest thing to a variable was...

893
00:59:45,650 --> 00:59:47,750
seeing groups of students graduate every year...

894
00:59:48,420 --> 00:59:50,520
and meeting new groups of students. That was mostly it.

895
00:59:51,520 --> 00:59:53,460
Perhaps, the balance in my bank account was it too.

896
00:59:54,960 --> 00:59:56,189
But ever since you joined,

897
00:59:56,190 --> 00:59:57,659
there's always something happening every day.

898
00:59:59,230 --> 01:00:01,869
Things I have never experienced are happening left and right.

899
01:00:02,799 --> 01:00:03,869
Like you said,

900
01:00:04,130 --> 01:00:06,469
I gave up my hard-earned spot for the advertisement for you.

901
01:00:07,040 --> 01:00:08,770
We secretly prepared for a lecture today.

902
01:00:09,670 --> 01:00:12,409
I even held a free lecture which experienced instructors never do.

903
01:00:14,310 --> 01:00:16,409
I also went through a huge failure I never had in my career.

904
01:00:18,719 --> 01:00:20,520
You were briefly on a time machine too.

905
01:00:21,449 --> 01:00:22,719
You met the young Lee Jun Ho too.

906
01:00:23,589 --> 01:00:24,619
Right.

907
01:00:28,589 --> 01:00:30,060
So did you not like that?

908
01:00:33,029 --> 01:00:34,569
No, that's not the right word.

909
01:00:35,199 --> 01:00:36,400
Well,

910
01:00:37,029 --> 01:00:38,239
was it unfamiliar?

911
01:00:39,100 --> 01:00:40,400
It wasn't fear?

912
01:00:41,770 --> 01:00:42,839
Well,

913
01:00:46,040 --> 01:00:47,440
maybe, it was.

914
01:00:49,409 --> 01:00:51,350
I don't like unpredictable things...

915
01:00:51,850 --> 01:00:54,049
when it comes to exam questions, my life,

916
01:00:55,619 --> 01:00:56,719
or relationships.

917
01:01:02,259 --> 01:01:04,059
Your hands aren't shaking. Hold onto this now.

918
01:01:04,060 --> 01:01:05,459
I'll step out.

919
01:01:05,460 --> 01:01:06,629
Take off your clothes and put them by the door.

920
01:01:06,630 --> 01:01:07,699
I'll dry them for you.

921
01:01:07,799 --> 01:01:08,830
Wait.

922
01:01:10,429 --> 01:01:11,799
Should I let you in on a secret?

923
01:01:13,170 --> 01:01:14,170
A secret?

924
01:01:17,310 --> 01:01:18,879
I had never respected Director Kim Hyun Tak...

925
01:01:18,880 --> 01:01:20,040
even for a moment.

926
01:01:21,279 --> 01:01:22,310
I can understand that.

927
01:01:22,380 --> 01:01:23,409
But...

928
01:01:25,380 --> 01:01:26,818
he earned my respect today.

929
01:01:26,819 --> 01:01:28,690
Well, although it was only a small ounce of respect.

930
01:01:29,489 --> 01:01:30,750
After this wet mess?

931
01:01:32,489 --> 01:01:34,060
I didn't know he would kneel in front of you.

932
01:01:36,159 --> 01:01:37,899
I thought that he was going to...

933
01:01:37,900 --> 01:01:40,400
give you ridiculous reasons like before. Goodness.

934
01:01:41,900 --> 01:01:43,199
It was like getting hit in the head.

935
01:01:45,699 --> 01:01:47,069
I realized that to get what I wanted,

936
01:01:48,710 --> 01:01:50,569
I should be willing to do everything it took like him.

937
01:01:51,980 --> 01:01:54,080
Right. Sometimes, he's like a sly snake.

938
01:01:54,980 --> 01:01:56,480
Sometimes, he's clever like a foxy.

939
01:01:57,779 --> 01:02:00,718
On days like today, he's like an innocent kindergartener.

940
01:02:00,719 --> 01:02:01,889
That's who he is.

941
01:02:02,489 --> 01:02:04,860
I've never seen a kindergartener as drunk as him.

942
01:02:05,659 --> 01:02:06,659
You're right.

943
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:19,000
Ms. Seo.

944
01:02:21,339 --> 01:02:23,239
Do you want to go back to how it was before?

945
01:02:25,210 --> 01:02:26,610
Before I joined here?

946
01:02:27,139 --> 01:02:28,679
When everything was predictable?

947
01:02:34,790 --> 01:02:35,949
That's the plan.

948
01:02:36,089 --> 01:02:38,319
I'm not asking about your plan. I'm asking what you want.

949
01:02:51,569 --> 01:02:53,900
I swore to you that I wouldn't hold you back.

950
01:02:54,739 --> 01:02:56,639
So what I'm about to say to you sounds really absurd.

951
01:02:57,869 --> 01:02:59,610
But Director Kim gave me courage.

952
01:03:01,110 --> 01:03:02,980
Like he kneeled down and lost face to get what he wanted,

953
01:03:04,409 --> 01:03:05,719
I must say what's on my mind.

954
01:03:10,089 --> 01:03:11,560
You said you would help me...

955
01:03:11,960 --> 01:03:13,360
get and do everything I wanted.

956
01:03:16,659 --> 01:03:18,060
I need you.

957
01:03:21,770 --> 01:03:23,330
You told me to leave when I had the chance.

958
01:03:23,500 --> 01:03:25,139
I'm not talking about Choisun Academy.

959
01:03:32,940 --> 01:03:34,480
Tell me right now...

960
01:03:34,850 --> 01:03:37,250
if you want to go back to how it was before. Before I got here.

961
01:03:38,719 --> 01:03:40,580
I'll try to hold myself back so desperately once again.

962
01:03:55,799 --> 01:03:57,699
If you're not asking me about my plan...

963
01:04:09,810 --> 01:04:11,350
I don't want to go back.

964
01:04:24,360 --> 01:04:25,500
You knew, didn't you?

965
01:04:28,730 --> 01:04:29,730
Know what?

966
01:04:30,699 --> 01:04:32,199
How you really felt.

967
01:04:35,639 --> 01:04:36,909
And how I felt too.

968
01:04:41,139 --> 01:04:42,178
I've been thinking,

969
01:04:42,179 --> 01:04:43,549
but there was not a chance you didn't know.

970
01:04:47,250 --> 01:04:48,589
That my first love...

971
01:04:50,889 --> 01:04:51,889
was you.

972
01:04:55,960 --> 01:04:57,488
What are you talking about?

973
01:04:57,489 --> 01:04:58,560
Now,

974
01:05:00,230 --> 01:05:01,368
I can't push my feelings away...

975
01:05:01,369 --> 01:05:02,730
with the excuse of first love anymore.

976
01:05:08,569 --> 01:05:11,210
I'm struggling to control my feelings for you...

977
01:05:11,310 --> 01:05:12,409
as they get bigger.

978
01:06:49,610 --> 01:06:53,339
(The Midnight Romance in Hagwon)

979
01:06:53,540 --> 01:06:55,049
I just confessed my feelings to her.

980
01:06:55,150 --> 01:06:57,380
- I'm losing it. - I like you, Ms. Seo.

981
01:06:57,480 --> 01:06:58,880
Could you see me as a man?

982
01:06:59,150 --> 01:07:00,250
- Is this... - No.

983
01:07:00,380 --> 01:07:01,618
I got shocking news.

984
01:07:01,619 --> 01:07:03,419
Seo Hye Jin might quit.

985
01:07:03,420 --> 01:07:06,258
She can't turn down this offer. It's the perfect offer.

986
01:07:06,259 --> 01:07:08,089
I won't tell anyone what I saw today.

987
01:07:08,230 --> 01:07:09,829
You can't get everything you want by wasting your time...

988
01:07:09,830 --> 01:07:11,360
talking about first love and whatnot.

989
01:07:11,960 --> 01:07:14,400
Then just remember that I like you.

990
01:07:14,560 --> 01:07:16,670
I only had eyes for you.

991
01:07:17,199 --> 01:07:19,000
You're acting quite cheeky with me.

992
01:07:19,339 --> 01:07:21,569
When I put my mind to something, I get it done. You know that, right?
