00:00:48,920 --> 00:00:52,350
Don't forget the best promotion is lecture skills and word of mouth.

9
00:00:52,550 --> 00:00:54,359
Understood. I'll do my best.

10
00:00:54,959 --> 00:00:55,990
Thank you.

11
00:01:05,670 --> 00:01:06,929
How about this?

12
00:01:10,100 --> 00:01:11,270
A teacher and student sally forth.

13
00:01:13,209 --> 00:01:14,539
A miraculous teacher and student.

14
00:01:15,679 --> 00:01:17,339
Isn't it a more touching story?

15
00:01:22,979 --> 00:01:24,020
I see.

(Daechi Chase)

17
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:33,059
It seems our discussion isn't quite finished.

18
00:01:37,970 --> 00:01:39,669
Could you elaborate on what you just said?

19
00:01:40,399 --> 00:01:41,599
From what I heard,

20
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:43,899
we're sharing a limited amount of pie in this industry.

21
00:01:44,309 --> 00:01:46,940
Right. We have a limited number of students.

22
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:48,910
But every year, the number of students is going down.

23
00:01:49,339 --> 00:01:51,610
Instead of fighting for only a small group of students,

24
00:01:52,149 --> 00:01:54,580
I thought it would be better to increase the number.

25
00:01:56,119 --> 00:01:57,789
And you need Seo Hye Jin to do that?

26
00:01:58,990 --> 00:02:01,720
When I first came to this academy, the biggest lecture room was...

27
00:02:02,860 --> 00:02:03,919
as big as this one.

28
00:02:04,589 --> 00:02:05,589
Right.

29
00:02:05,789 --> 00:02:07,830
All the desks and chairs were secondhand too.

30
00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:11,399
Ms. Seo helped you grow this academy into a major institution.

31
00:02:15,769 --> 00:02:17,810
What if she sees this as a bad attempt at charity?

32
00:02:19,739 --> 00:02:21,109
If you sign off on this,

33
00:02:21,780 --> 00:02:24,780
I'll look for a way to persuade Ms. Seo.

34
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:28,019
So this will be a deal, not charity.

35
00:02:35,460 --> 00:02:36,889
I hope you can bring me some good news.

36
00:02:39,259 --> 00:02:41,060
The final exam is coming up soon.

37
00:02:41,229 --> 00:02:43,999
All the academies will go into full battle mode.

38
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,530
- Before the battle begins... - Let's get our fighting spirit up.

39
00:02:48,370 --> 00:02:49,440
Yes, sir.

40
00:03:02,380 --> 00:03:04,690
(Although he goes to Byung Young...)

41
00:03:07,419 --> 00:03:08,788
So the teacher from Chanyoung High won't use...

42
00:03:08,789 --> 00:03:09,789
any supplementary materials?

43
00:03:10,620 --> 00:03:13,359
That's what the schoolteacher said. So my hands are tied.

44
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:18,329
Summarizing their notes from school for them is a bad habit.

45
00:03:19,669 --> 00:03:20,698
How harsh.

46
00:03:20,699 --> 00:03:21,899
I can maintain the highest number of students...

47
00:03:21,900 --> 00:03:22,900
from Chanyoung High thanks to this.

48
00:03:24,340 --> 00:03:25,509
Go easy on that.

49
00:03:26,069 --> 00:03:27,339
Your wrists and vocal cords...

50
00:03:27,340 --> 00:03:29,009
are all we have. But they all have an end date.

51
00:03:30,440 --> 00:03:31,979
They have a short shelf life for a reason.

52
00:03:33,479 --> 00:03:34,750
Thanks for your concern.

53
00:03:58,169 --> 00:04:00,239
- Ms. Seo. - Yes?

54
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:03,210
I have something to discuss with you.

55
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:04,549
Go ahead.

56
00:04:08,150 --> 00:04:09,220
Could I talk to you in private?

57
00:04:12,549 --> 00:04:13,650
How about the meeting room?

58
00:04:14,220 --> 00:04:15,220
Sure.

59
00:04:25,700 --> 00:04:27,299
Why did you suggest that? No one asked you to do that.

60
00:04:27,799 --> 00:04:28,969
Because I didn't want to.

61
00:04:28,970 --> 00:04:30,169
It felt like I was stealing your spot.

62
00:04:30,999 --> 00:04:32,470
But he explained the reason behind it.

63
00:04:33,169 --> 00:04:34,878
But that was all based on the director's hunch.

64
00:04:34,879 --> 00:04:37,238
The other teachers would think that I'm getting nothing more than...

65
00:04:37,239 --> 00:04:39,450
just some special treatment for no reason.

66
00:04:41,379 --> 00:04:43,020
So you want to use me as your shield?

67
00:04:44,489 --> 00:04:47,489
To be precise, this will be a strategic partnership.

68
00:04:47,890 --> 00:04:48,919
My answer is no.

69
00:04:49,489 --> 00:04:50,489
I knew it.

70
00:04:50,890 --> 00:04:53,928
Being the face of the academy won't bring a huge effect or anything.

71
00:04:53,929 --> 00:04:55,160
It's just a symbolic role.

72
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:57,600
That's what people who couldn't utilize this chance would say.

73
00:05:02,369 --> 00:05:03,499
Enough is enough.

74
00:05:05,210 --> 00:05:06,639
Just because I said you should go for what you want,

75
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:08,479
do you think I suddenly don't have any pride?

76
00:05:09,140 --> 00:05:11,149
No, Ms. Seo. It's not what you think.

77
00:05:11,150 --> 00:05:13,650
Did you think I would gladly say yes to your offer?

78
00:05:13,879 --> 00:05:15,379
I knew you wouldn't be happy.

79
00:05:16,179 --> 00:05:17,719
- Then what? - I thought you would choose...

80
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:19,389
the benefit over your pride...

81
00:05:19,390 --> 00:05:21,660
by staying cool-headed just like now.

82
00:05:23,260 --> 00:05:24,419
How was I just now?

83
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:26,129
You weren't surprised...

84
00:05:26,689 --> 00:05:28,799
when I told you that your face wouldn't be on the posters anymore.

85
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:32,929
I told you that you and I had to compete too.

86
00:05:33,929 --> 00:05:35,970
Don't say no just yet. Please reconsider.

87
00:05:36,539 --> 00:05:37,939
You should reconsider.

88
00:05:38,169 --> 00:05:39,839
Seizing the chance when it's presented in front of you...

89
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:41,109
is a skill you need to be successful here. Okay?

(Lecture Room)

91
00:06:00,260 --> 00:06:01,260
What was that?

92
00:06:01,830 --> 00:06:03,229
So I have to find a way, right?

93
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:05,629
A way that can benefit both of us.

94
00:06:06,700 --> 00:06:08,600
When I find it, you have to join me.

95
00:06:10,270 --> 00:06:11,808
I told you that was unnecessary.

96
00:06:11,809 --> 00:06:13,570
Come on. Promise me. That's your signature move.

97
00:06:13,809 --> 00:06:15,780
"If you can solve this, I'll let you go home." You know?

98
00:06:16,410 --> 00:06:17,510
Sure, find it then.

99
00:06:18,609 --> 00:06:19,780
That's a promise.

100
00:06:20,309 --> 00:06:21,520
You promise me too.

101
00:06:22,549 --> 00:06:23,619
Anything.

102
00:06:24,049 --> 00:06:25,748
The special lecture for the finals is around the corner.

103
00:06:25,749 --> 00:06:27,890
I don't have time to waste, bickering over matters like this.

104
00:06:28,989 --> 00:06:30,059
You have until tomorrow.

105
00:06:32,760 --> 00:06:33,760
Sounds good.

106
00:06:41,799 --> 00:06:44,200
- Here. - Thank you.

107
00:06:47,570 --> 00:06:49,409
You don't have any classes yet.

108
00:06:49,410 --> 00:06:51,549
I thought I wouldn't have a chance to talk to you until later.

109
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:55,279
I'm new to this neighbourhood.

110
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:56,949
I was wondering...

111
00:06:56,950 --> 00:06:58,890
if I could get some help or if you had any advice to pass on.

112
00:06:59,489 --> 00:07:00,589
It's my understanding that...

113
00:07:00,590 --> 00:07:02,760
counsellors have a lot of experience and information.

114
00:07:02,820 --> 00:07:04,789
Where did you hear that?

115
00:07:04,989 --> 00:07:06,260
From an online forum.

116
00:07:11,770 --> 00:07:13,030
I see.

117
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:18,140
What kind of advice do you want?

118
00:07:18,239 --> 00:07:19,609
Well,

119
00:07:20,609 --> 00:07:21,809
to tell you the truth,

120
00:07:22,309 --> 00:07:24,609
I'm at a disadvantage.

121
00:07:25,580 --> 00:07:27,079
I didn't graduate from a prestigious school.

122
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:28,650
I don't have any teaching experience in this neighbourhood.

123
00:07:30,280 --> 00:07:33,618
Even so. You beat many impressive candidates to get a job here.

124
00:07:33,619 --> 00:07:35,090
You should be more confident.

125
00:07:35,989 --> 00:07:37,189
Mr. Lee Jun Ho was...

126
00:07:37,660 --> 00:07:40,129
called into the director's office for a private meeting.

127
00:07:43,030 --> 00:07:45,299
That must have hurt your feelings a bit.

128
00:07:45,770 --> 00:07:48,169
I want to show them what I can do as a teacher.

129
00:07:49,169 --> 00:07:50,400
What should I do?

130
00:07:53,809 --> 00:07:55,109
I never thought...

131
00:07:55,309 --> 00:07:58,080
I would be getting such an innocent question in Daechi-dong.

132
00:07:58,580 --> 00:08:00,650
I'm confident that I'm just as good as any other teacher here.

133
00:08:02,220 --> 00:08:03,879
Since you asked me an innocent question,

134
00:08:04,580 --> 00:08:06,749
I will give you an innocent answer too.

Pardon?

137
00:08:13,059 --> 00:08:15,100
So how can I do that?

138
00:08:15,900 --> 00:08:18,429
If I knew the answer to that, I should be teaching here.

00:12:44,529 --> 00:12:45,529
What?

183
00:12:46,129 --> 00:12:47,600
You're bothering me too.

184
00:12:48,639 --> 00:12:49,639
Hey.

185
00:12:49,640 --> 00:12:51,609
If I could help it, I didn't want to go against you...

186
00:12:52,139 --> 00:12:53,769
and I was going to do what you said.

187
00:12:53,970 --> 00:12:55,810
- But what? - I don't want to do that.

188
00:12:56,779 --> 00:12:58,279
I'll do this with you no matter what.

189
00:12:58,850 --> 00:13:00,009
This is for my benefit.

190
00:13:00,379 --> 00:13:02,220
- Jun Ho. - You told me to find a way.

191
00:13:02,920 --> 00:13:03,950
And I did.

192
00:13:07,550 --> 00:13:08,590
All right.

193
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:10,989
Become my partner.

194
00:13:11,989 --> 00:13:13,758
A joint curriculum, a joint promotional ad,

195
00:13:13,759 --> 00:13:14,759
and a joint lecture.

196
00:13:15,159 --> 00:13:17,629
To put it simply, a teacher and student sally forth.

197
00:13:19,369 --> 00:13:22,170
This kind of chance won't come often. You know?

198
00:13:22,670 --> 00:13:25,039
Didn't I tell you? No one here is your colleague.

199
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:26,639
But you said there could be quid pro quo.

200
00:13:27,540 --> 00:13:28,638
My answer is no.

201
00:13:28,639 --> 00:13:31,180
I already have the highest number of students from Chanyoung High.

202
00:13:31,210 --> 00:13:33,009
But that's not your end goal.

203
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:34,609
I can handle my own business.

204
00:13:34,779 --> 00:13:35,820
We should start with...

205
00:13:42,119 --> 00:13:43,290
Heewon High School.

206
00:13:45,960 --> 00:13:47,158
Getting good grades...

207
00:13:47,159 --> 00:13:48,459
at this autonomous private all-boys high school...

208
00:13:48,460 --> 00:13:50,029
is as challenging as at Chanyoung High.

209
00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:53,769
This is uncharted territory for you. In other words,

210
00:13:55,170 --> 00:13:56,540
this is your Wailing Wall.

211
00:13:59,340 --> 00:14:01,009
I realized it when I was looking at the Hall of Fame.

212
00:14:01,979 --> 00:14:04,478
That you mostly focused on two schools at the minimum...

213
00:14:04,479 --> 00:14:06,779
or three schools at max.

214
00:14:07,609 --> 00:14:08,949
But the Seo Hye Jin I know...

215
00:14:08,950 --> 00:14:11,080
would never be happy with just a couple of schools.

216
00:14:12,090 --> 00:14:13,749
She would have given her best.

217
00:14:14,690 --> 00:14:15,920
Then I found it.

218
00:14:16,590 --> 00:14:18,060
The evidence of your best effort.

219
00:14:19,460 --> 00:14:20,590
What did you see?

220
00:14:20,859 --> 00:14:22,498
For the past three years,

221
00:14:22,499 --> 00:14:24,059
you have held a total of eight information sessions...

222
00:14:24,060 --> 00:14:25,629
for the parents from Heewon High.

223
00:14:26,269 --> 00:14:27,300
But...

224
00:14:28,540 --> 00:14:30,040
you never had enough students to run a class.

225
00:14:30,869 --> 00:14:32,008
Only three students signed up...

226
00:14:32,009 --> 00:14:33,369
for your special lecture for the midterm exam.

227
00:14:34,769 --> 00:14:35,778
But you had to turn them away...

228
00:14:35,779 --> 00:14:36,940
as the enrolment requirement wasn't met.

229
00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:39,909
Do you know why I couldn't meet the requirement?

230
00:14:41,210 --> 00:14:44,050
Because there was a chief gatekeeper at the Wailing Wall.

231
00:14:47,090 --> 00:14:48,419
This mythical figure has had...

232
00:14:48,420 --> 00:14:49,758
the highest number of students...

233
00:14:49,759 --> 00:14:51,290
from Heewon High for the past 20 years.

234
00:14:55,560 --> 00:14:56,600
Right.

235
00:14:57,560 --> 00:14:58,670
Choisun Academy.

236
00:14:59,670 --> 00:15:00,800
Director Choi Hyung Sun.

237
00:15:01,769 --> 00:15:02,800
Also known as...

238
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:05,269
White Haired Witch.

239
00:15:05,509 --> 00:15:08,709
(Daechi Choisun Academy)

240
00:15:08,710 --> 00:15:10,409
(Director's Office)

241
00:15:10,909 --> 00:15:12,148
She's a former teacher at Heewon High.

242
00:15:12,149 --> 00:15:13,679
Then she started teaching at an academy.

243
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:15,749
Four hundred students from Heewon High...

244
00:15:18,050 --> 00:15:19,850
are taking Director Choi's class.

245
00:15:22,889 --> 00:15:24,118
She has never cancelled her class or been late...

246
00:15:24,119 --> 00:15:25,129
in her 20 years of teaching.

247
00:15:25,359 --> 00:15:27,528
Her crazy self-discipline is so creepy that...

248
00:15:27,529 --> 00:15:28,600
people call her a witch.

249
00:15:30,999 --> 00:15:31,999
Gosh.

250
00:15:33,129 --> 00:15:35,239
You did well on your tests, right?

251
00:15:35,340 --> 00:15:36,399
- Yes. - Yes.

252
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:38,340
I've already emphasized it many times.

253
00:15:38,609 --> 00:15:42,310
Your school grades are the factor that evaluates your diligence.

254
00:15:43,139 --> 00:15:45,450
This isn't a time of pain, but an opportunity.

255
00:15:46,850 --> 00:15:49,220
It's a precious opportunity...

256
00:15:49,379 --> 00:15:51,579
for you to beat your fellow classmates who read...

257
00:15:51,580 --> 00:15:52,850
thousands of books growing up.

258
00:15:53,350 --> 00:15:54,988
You can't afford to miss even one question.

259
00:15:54,989 --> 00:15:56,019
- Yes, ma'am. - Yes, ma'am.

260
00:15:56,460 --> 00:15:57,960
Let's do our best today as usual.

261
00:15:58,119 --> 00:16:00,229
- Yes, ma'am. - Open your book to Page 89.

262
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:10,238
(Daechi Choisun Academy)

263
00:16:10,239 --> 00:16:11,569
The monthly revenues she makes from the students...

264
00:16:11,570 --> 00:16:13,109
- of Heewon High... - I'll make a lump-sum payment.

265
00:16:13,310 --> 00:16:14,909
must make the annual salary of an executive look insignificant.

266
00:16:16,239 --> 00:16:17,679
Her TAs changed several times.

267
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:20,080
But this loyal TA of hers has been working for her for eight years.

268
00:16:21,180 --> 00:16:22,378
Some say he's a high school graduate.

269
00:16:22,379 --> 00:16:23,979
Some say he has a PhD.

270
00:16:24,149 --> 00:16:25,920
But the bottom line is that no one knows for sure.

271
00:16:26,889 --> 00:16:28,320
Where did you hear about her TA?

272
00:16:28,790 --> 00:16:30,618
I called my friends who went to Heewon High.

273
00:16:30,619 --> 00:16:32,129
Everyone went to Choisun Academy.

274
00:16:32,989 --> 00:16:35,089
All the top Korean teachers took a shot at her.

275
00:16:35,090 --> 00:16:36,229
But they couldn't even make a dent.

276
00:16:37,499 --> 00:16:39,268
Teaching at an academy at the age of 60...

277
00:16:39,269 --> 00:16:40,600
isn't an easy thing to do.

278
00:16:42,070 --> 00:16:43,070
Exactly.

279
00:16:43,670 --> 00:16:44,800
The new generation must take over.

280
00:16:45,409 --> 00:16:47,539
I'm saying that changing the promotional poster...

281
00:16:47,540 --> 00:16:48,679
won't help us sign her students.

282
00:16:48,680 --> 00:16:50,340
But we can mark a new era with this.

283
00:16:50,840 --> 00:16:51,950
With this teacher-student concept?

284
00:16:53,879 --> 00:16:55,379
Here's a thing about teachers.

285
00:16:56,149 --> 00:16:58,080
They can stir up your innermost ambitions.

286
00:17:01,989 --> 00:17:03,519
Okay. Fine.

287
00:17:03,720 --> 00:17:05,729
Say that I somehow got the students from Heewon High enrolled.

288
00:17:05,759 --> 00:17:07,029
That's a big gain for me. Yes.

289
00:17:07,330 --> 00:17:09,100
But what about you? What will you gain from this?

290
00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:13,730
A glorious debut.

291
00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:17,740
The news of breaking down her gate.

292
00:17:18,340 --> 00:17:20,040
Then the powerful ruler will be furious at me.

293
00:17:20,969 --> 00:17:23,139
The fury will turn into attention.

294
00:17:23,879 --> 00:17:25,980
That kind of attention will have priceless value.

295
00:17:40,060 --> 00:17:41,129
What do you think?

296
00:17:42,560 --> 00:17:44,359
Is this worth your time and energy?

297
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:51,840
Yes.

298
00:18:20,629 --> 00:18:21,939
I'll have the students sign up...

299
00:18:22,639 --> 00:18:24,240
for this class schedule for the final exam.

300
00:18:28,580 --> 00:18:31,708
(Daechi Choisun Academy)

301
00:18:31,709 --> 00:18:33,580
There hasn't been any changes from the midterm schedule, correct?

302
00:18:33,609 --> 00:18:36,550
Right. All the teachers are focusing on their main school.

303
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:40,949
That explains why they're happy with making 10,000 dollars a month.

304
00:18:44,159 --> 00:18:45,830
Don't you know that things are shaky at Chanyoung High?

305
00:18:46,429 --> 00:18:47,688
All of their notes from previous exams...

306
00:18:47,689 --> 00:18:48,959
will be useless now.

307
00:18:49,730 --> 00:18:51,799
That's why Mr. Lee Yi Joong...

308
00:18:51,800 --> 00:18:53,169
will hold a big parent information session...

309
00:18:53,929 --> 00:18:55,070
Do you think he can get the job done?

310
00:18:56,540 --> 00:18:58,369
Our next year's sales will be riding on this.

311
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:03,439
We don't have enough time to recruit another teacher.

312
00:19:13,050 --> 00:19:15,090
I'll do it. I'll take Chanyoung High.

313
00:19:15,719 --> 00:19:16,719
Pardon?

314
00:19:17,790 --> 00:19:19,688
Tell them to put up a banner I'll do a lecture for students...

315
00:19:19,689 --> 00:19:20,790
from Chanyoung High.

316
00:19:21,889 --> 00:19:22,899
Yes, ma'am.

317
00:19:26,070 --> 00:19:27,169
When will you start?

318
00:19:27,830 --> 00:19:29,638
Seo Hye Jin will probably start her class...

319
00:19:29,639 --> 00:19:30,639
six weeks before the exam.

320
00:19:30,840 --> 00:19:31,840
Oh, right.

321
00:19:33,740 --> 00:19:34,770
Seo Hye Jin.

322
00:19:35,409 --> 00:19:36,409
Yes.

323
00:19:41,209 --> 00:19:42,820
I'll start mine on the same day.

324
00:19:44,550 --> 00:19:47,350
Well, why don't you start a week earlier?

325
00:19:47,550 --> 00:19:49,119
To have an upper hand.

326
00:19:49,560 --> 00:19:50,790
Make it the same day.

327
00:19:52,830 --> 00:19:54,889
Yes, ma'am. Understood.

328
00:19:57,929 --> 00:19:59,468
At Heewon High, over half of the students...

329
00:19:59,469 --> 00:20:01,000
score higher than 90 points on the Korean exams.

330
00:20:01,100 --> 00:20:02,138
So many students get pushed down...

331
00:20:02,139 --> 00:20:03,800
to the 4th class after getting 2 or 3 questions wrong.

332
00:20:04,570 --> 00:20:06,108
The students have a high level of education,

333
00:20:06,109 --> 00:20:07,209
but they're overly sensitive.

334
00:20:08,270 --> 00:20:09,540
That's my speciality.

335
00:20:10,310 --> 00:20:12,709
I'm sure you know. Going up to 60 points from 10 points is easy.

336
00:20:13,780 --> 00:20:15,480
But trying to get a perfect score from 90 points...

337
00:20:16,580 --> 00:20:18,350
Why do I even bother saying it? It's worse than dying.

338
00:20:19,219 --> 00:20:20,389
So did you want to die?

339
00:20:20,550 --> 00:20:22,219
It was like going through the loss of humanity.

340
00:20:23,560 --> 00:20:25,689
As my class went up, the materials got harder to study.

341
00:20:26,490 --> 00:20:28,730
One by one, I started to see my friends as walls I had to climb.

342
00:20:29,429 --> 00:20:30,500
I didn't know.

343
00:20:31,399 --> 00:20:32,530
I acted tough.

344
00:20:33,030 --> 00:20:35,270
It's not very cool to let people catch you feeling anxious.

345
00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:39,969
Still, I was okay.

346
00:20:41,040 --> 00:20:42,240
I had you.

347
00:20:43,439 --> 00:20:44,780
Advertising isn't enough.

348
00:20:45,449 --> 00:20:47,010
There has to be something else with a big impact.

349
00:20:48,250 --> 00:20:49,280
I know.

350
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:54,149
Getting kids is the first step.

351
00:20:54,919 --> 00:20:56,819
Maintaining classes, finding books to expand on,

352
00:20:56,820 --> 00:20:58,320
and getting a good lecture force is second.

353
00:20:58,830 --> 00:20:59,889
Both are hard.

354
00:21:00,929 --> 00:21:02,300
I am determined.

355
00:21:05,159 --> 00:21:08,030
Don't make any plans from 10pm to midnight for the time being.

356
00:21:11,369 --> 00:21:12,510
Are you doing this with me?

357
00:21:13,709 --> 00:21:15,339
Well, co-lecturing while preparing for exams...

358
00:21:15,340 --> 00:21:18,439
isn't really something I've tried before.

359
00:21:19,080 --> 00:21:20,750
But I think it could grab people's attention.

360
00:21:22,780 --> 00:21:25,350
I will make sure that you don't regret it.

361
00:21:27,189 --> 00:21:28,958
If two lecturers are too far apart in their teaching skills, it's over.

362
00:21:28,959 --> 00:21:29,959
We'd just fall together.

363
00:21:29,960 --> 00:21:32,459
Gosh. That will never happen. Never.

364
00:21:32,730 --> 00:21:35,530
Excuse me. I just warned you.

365
00:21:35,560 --> 00:21:36,830
It means, "Don't try to tie me down."

366
00:21:38,770 --> 00:21:39,770
Got it?

367
00:21:39,929 --> 00:21:41,469
What? Oh, okay.

368
00:21:42,669 --> 00:21:44,599
Well, you're going to teach like you mean it anyway.

369
00:21:44,600 --> 00:21:47,209
You might even keep me from going home like you used to.

370
00:21:47,409 --> 00:21:48,409
Hey.

371
00:21:49,010 --> 00:21:51,040
Shouldn't you be thanking me first?

372
00:21:51,510 --> 00:21:53,409
I don't express my thanks with words.

373
00:21:54,179 --> 00:21:55,179
Then what?

374
00:21:55,619 --> 00:21:57,750
Jewels and riches. A shining reputation.

375
00:21:59,090 --> 00:22:00,989
The memories of victory that you will take to the grave.

376
00:22:00,990 --> 00:22:02,260
Stuff like that. I'll give that to you.

377
00:22:05,359 --> 00:22:09,060
I wish you could be less of a smooth talker.

378
00:22:09,730 --> 00:22:10,760
I know, right?

379
00:22:11,629 --> 00:22:13,270
You shouldn't have taught me so well.

380
00:22:35,350 --> 00:22:36,389
Oh, right.

381
00:22:38,459 --> 00:22:39,490
Right.

382
00:22:40,530 --> 00:22:41,560
Almost forgot.

383
00:22:42,899 --> 00:22:45,059
Here. Take a quick look through these first.

384
00:22:45,060 --> 00:22:47,199
- There will be a lot to study. - Okay.

385
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:49,240
Send me a text when you get home.

386
00:22:49,899 --> 00:22:52,409
Forget it. Isn't it scarier to get a text at night?

387
00:22:52,639 --> 00:22:53,810
Still, text me.

388
00:22:54,869 --> 00:22:56,580
Fine. I will. Bye.

389
00:22:56,639 --> 00:22:59,209
Oh, and there's something else I haven't told you.

390
00:22:59,649 --> 00:23:00,679
What?

391
00:23:01,080 --> 00:23:02,280
I'm moving out soon.

392
00:23:03,820 --> 00:23:04,879
Did you get kicked out?

393
00:23:05,820 --> 00:23:06,949
I'm just moving out.

394
00:23:08,889 --> 00:23:10,519
Gosh, but with my savings,

395
00:23:10,520 --> 00:23:12,589
I couldn't find anywhere to live in this neighbourhood.

396
00:23:12,590 --> 00:23:14,590
I nearly lost my mind while going around to realtors...

397
00:23:15,030 --> 00:23:16,060
So?

398
00:23:16,230 --> 00:23:17,500
I'm looking for a place near yours.

399
00:23:18,030 --> 00:23:19,070
Why?

400
00:23:19,330 --> 00:23:20,600
Well, it's cheaper than this area.

401
00:23:20,830 --> 00:23:22,439
And it'd be easy to carpool.

402
00:23:23,570 --> 00:23:26,109
I won't have money for a car once I pay my deposit.

403
00:23:28,540 --> 00:23:29,780
Anyway, just letting you know.

404
00:23:30,340 --> 00:23:32,350
Oh, and don't forget to text me.

405
00:23:41,050 --> 00:23:42,189
I can't keep up with him.

406
00:24:25,770 --> 00:24:26,830
I'm home.

407
00:24:27,770 --> 00:24:28,830
Is that it?

408
00:24:40,050 --> 00:24:41,080
Goodnight.

409
00:24:53,659 --> 00:24:56,260
(Aren't you hungry? I'm about to die of starvation.)

410
00:24:56,730 --> 00:24:57,830
Aren't you hungry?

411
00:24:58,399 --> 00:24:59,500
I'm about to die of starvation.

412
00:25:03,399 --> 00:25:05,469
Sorry. Starting tomorrow, let's work after we eat.

413
00:25:07,369 --> 00:25:08,570
Yes!

414
00:26:01,889 --> 00:26:03,060
Are you already asleep?

415
00:26:05,459 --> 00:26:06,469
Ms. Seo?

416
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:11,570
Seo Hye Jin. Are you sleeping?

417
00:26:15,669 --> 00:26:16,679
No.

418
00:28:13,189 --> 00:28:15,090
Goodness. Look who it is.

419
00:28:15,260 --> 00:28:16,459
Isn't this Director Choi?

420
00:28:16,859 --> 00:28:18,530
It's been a while, Director.

421
00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:19,898
What brings you here?

422
00:28:19,899 --> 00:28:21,869
You never used to come to directors' meetings.

423
00:28:22,840 --> 00:28:25,939
It must be because I'm not skilled at running my academy,

424
00:28:26,010 --> 00:28:28,939
but I'm still busy lecturing, so I couldn't show up.

425
00:28:29,639 --> 00:28:31,310
I'm jealous in many ways.

426
00:28:31,540 --> 00:28:33,010
- Shall we head inside? - Of course.

427
00:28:49,129 --> 00:28:50,398
These are the schedules for special lectures...

428
00:28:50,399 --> 00:28:51,899
by big single-subject academies during finals season.

429
00:28:52,399 --> 00:28:54,330
And these are the schedules for the main math academies.

430
00:28:55,300 --> 00:28:57,698
You have to avoid math classes at each of the schools,

431
00:28:57,699 --> 00:28:59,369
so please note these in preparation for finals.

432
00:29:00,540 --> 00:29:01,869
That darned math...

433
00:29:03,439 --> 00:29:05,240
There isn't much difference from the midterms.

434
00:29:06,379 --> 00:29:08,879
Can we expect your schedules...

435
00:29:08,980 --> 00:29:12,179
to remain the same as your special lectures during the midterm season?

436
00:29:12,919 --> 00:29:15,250
We're keeping things the same,

437
00:29:15,719 --> 00:29:18,019
from having Wednesdays off to seasonal schools.

438
00:29:18,020 --> 00:29:19,060
Yes, sure.

439
00:29:19,119 --> 00:29:20,230
Sounds good.

440
00:29:21,659 --> 00:29:24,699
I think we might have some changes.

441
00:29:25,560 --> 00:29:27,070
Did you get more students from Heewon High School?

442
00:29:28,869 --> 00:29:31,070
It's not that. I was thinking...

443
00:29:35,409 --> 00:29:37,639
I'd open up a class for Chanyoung High School.

444
00:29:40,649 --> 00:29:41,780
You mean you'd do an in-person lecture?

445
00:29:42,250 --> 00:29:44,379
The schools have changed their exam question policies,

446
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:47,889
and we have to prepare to take in pre-high school students.

447
00:29:48,520 --> 00:29:49,889
We've been getting lots of consultation inquiries.

448
00:29:50,490 --> 00:29:51,858
I heard that you also hired...

449
00:29:51,859 --> 00:29:54,530
a lecturer from a big academy, Director Joo.

450
00:29:55,889 --> 00:29:57,030
My goodness.

451
00:29:57,800 --> 00:29:59,429
Rumours sure spread fast in Daechi-dong.

452
00:30:01,230 --> 00:30:04,240
The students at Chanyoung High are so fortunate.

453
00:30:07,540 --> 00:30:09,909
Ms. Seo Hye Jin is so talented.

454
00:30:10,840 --> 00:30:13,609
Everyone else is just a challenger, including me.

455
00:30:44,679 --> 00:30:50,080
(Houses, Stores, Studios)

456
00:30:50,580 --> 00:30:53,089
(Land, Stores, Apartments, Houses)

457
00:30:53,090 --> 00:30:55,590
(Monthly rent 1,000 dollars, Studio deposit 50,000 dollars)

458
00:30:59,159 --> 00:31:00,189
Yes, Director.

459
00:31:02,030 --> 00:31:03,230
I'm on my way to work.

460
00:31:05,659 --> 00:31:07,399
Yes, I think it will take me about 30 minutes.

461
00:31:08,070 --> 00:31:09,070
All right.

462
00:31:14,669 --> 00:31:17,040
As you said, this parent information session...

463
00:31:17,109 --> 00:31:19,749
will be conducted in two parts for Heewon and Chanyoung High Schools.

464
00:31:19,750 --> 00:31:21,280
We've already sent out text messages to let people know.

465
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:24,619
We've also reserved the hotel catering service as you mentioned.

466
00:31:26,119 --> 00:31:27,489
The limit on the number of people attending the session in person...

467
00:31:27,490 --> 00:31:28,850
will be 50 people in order of arrival.

468
00:31:30,219 --> 00:31:32,459
I think about 30 people would be enough.

469
00:31:33,929 --> 00:31:35,290
We're worried that more people might come.

470
00:31:36,100 --> 00:31:38,159
In case it strains your health, ma'am.

471
00:31:56,350 --> 00:31:57,419
Yes?

472
00:32:01,590 --> 00:32:03,289
Director, here is what you asked for.

473
00:32:03,290 --> 00:32:04,290
Thank you.

474
00:32:05,919 --> 00:32:08,688
But maybe you should go see a doctor if it's bothering you.

475
00:32:08,689 --> 00:32:10,560
No, I'm fine. You can step out now.

476
00:32:11,060 --> 00:32:12,060
Yes, sir.

477
00:32:19,340 --> 00:32:21,310
So, Ms. Seo,

478
00:32:21,740 --> 00:32:24,810
it's good news to me that you accepted Mr. Lee's suggestion.

479
00:32:25,209 --> 00:32:26,750
It will be a good concept.

480
00:32:27,409 --> 00:32:28,480
It's true, but...

481
00:32:30,619 --> 00:32:32,679
An unexpected variable has come up.

482
00:32:35,419 --> 00:32:36,659
Choisun Academy is...

483
00:32:37,659 --> 00:32:40,330
opening up an in-person lecture by the director for Chanyoung High.

484
00:32:44,260 --> 00:32:45,459
By Choisun Academy...

485
00:32:46,730 --> 00:32:47,899
The White Haired Witch?

486
00:32:49,899 --> 00:32:51,369
Ms. Seo has had...

487
00:32:51,540 --> 00:32:53,239
the most students from Chanyoung High...

488
00:32:53,240 --> 00:32:54,669
for over seven years now.

489
00:32:55,109 --> 00:32:57,139
Our efforts won't fall apart that easily,

490
00:32:57,909 --> 00:33:00,280
but it does make me anxious... I mean, uncomfortable.

491
00:33:01,280 --> 00:33:02,350
Gosh, I'm sorry.

492
00:33:03,379 --> 00:33:04,480
Goodness.

493
00:33:11,520 --> 00:33:14,689
So, let's put a hold on changing the ads and whatnot.

494
00:33:15,230 --> 00:33:17,199
I think our priority should be to maintain our Chanyoung students.

495
00:33:17,560 --> 00:33:19,599
Yes, sure. It doesn't matter to me.

496
00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:20,600
No.

497
00:33:23,139 --> 00:33:24,969
Our goal isn't to maintain the current figures.

498
00:33:25,369 --> 00:33:26,810
Goodbye, then.

499
00:33:26,909 --> 00:33:28,208
- We're in your care. - Of course.

500
00:33:28,209 --> 00:33:29,438
Chae Won, let's meet again.

501
00:33:29,439 --> 00:33:31,080
- Bye. - Okay, bye.

502
00:33:31,510 --> 00:33:35,409
(Daechi Chase)

503
00:33:37,350 --> 00:33:39,889
I earned my keep today as well.

504
00:33:41,919 --> 00:33:43,889
You were born to do this job.

505
00:33:45,020 --> 00:33:47,289
I'm halfway to being a shaman.

506
00:33:47,290 --> 00:33:50,530
I can see where I should scratch to satisfy people's itches.

507
00:33:51,060 --> 00:33:53,230
Gosh, you're not far off from setting off on your own.

508
00:33:53,369 --> 00:33:54,429
Shush, you.

509
00:33:55,369 --> 00:33:56,638
Think things through carefully.

510
00:33:56,639 --> 00:33:58,469
It's less stressful to get paid a monthly paycheck.

511
00:34:01,439 --> 00:34:04,580
You never know when someone will get into a fight or want to quit.

512
00:34:05,310 --> 00:34:08,250
Being a director is just a series of stressful situations.

513
00:34:08,280 --> 00:34:09,619
Is something the matter?

514
00:34:09,780 --> 00:34:10,850
I don't know.

515
00:34:13,420 --> 00:34:16,719
But things felt quite serious in the director's office.

516
00:34:17,520 --> 00:34:20,460
He even had Ms. Seo and Mr. Lee in there.

517
00:34:22,659 --> 00:34:24,060
Heewon High School, you say...

518
00:34:28,569 --> 00:34:31,568
And it's not just about raking in the students...

519
00:34:31,569 --> 00:34:33,270
that Director Choi loses.

520
00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:35,839
We should shovel them in. The White Haired Witch's students.

521
00:34:36,580 --> 00:34:37,710
Starting with the 10th graders.

522
00:34:42,750 --> 00:34:43,779
Gosh.

523
00:34:44,179 --> 00:34:45,548
If this plan succeeds,

524
00:34:45,549 --> 00:34:47,088
it will make the directors of Daechi-dong...

525
00:34:47,089 --> 00:34:48,589
jerk awake from their sleep.

526
00:34:48,850 --> 00:34:49,960
That's what we want.

527
00:34:53,429 --> 00:34:54,630
Look at you...

528
00:34:57,699 --> 00:34:58,759
Sit next to each other.

529
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:01,500
Go on.

530
00:35:04,770 --> 00:35:06,710
A bit closer.

531
00:35:08,440 --> 00:35:09,469
Right next to each other.

532
00:35:11,810 --> 00:35:12,839
Be affectionate.

533
00:35:14,710 --> 00:35:15,710
Be affectionate.

534
00:35:20,750 --> 00:35:22,718
Would the teacher-student concept...

535
00:35:22,719 --> 00:35:24,119
have enough of an impact?

536
00:35:24,819 --> 00:35:26,659
We should make an impact.

537
00:35:26,860 --> 00:35:27,960
How?

538
00:35:28,089 --> 00:35:29,290
Well...

539
00:35:31,130 --> 00:35:34,330
First of all, please make a call to Director Choi.

540
00:35:34,529 --> 00:35:35,969
To the White Haired Witch?

541
00:35:36,339 --> 00:35:37,670
Gosh, why should I?

542
00:35:37,969 --> 00:35:39,810
Just let her know that...

543
00:35:41,409 --> 00:35:42,469
I am scared.

544
00:35:43,409 --> 00:35:45,480
The principle is to only give questions from the textbooks.

545
00:35:45,980 --> 00:35:48,549
The meticulous memorization method that Choisun Academy boasts...

546
00:35:48,679 --> 00:35:49,819
will be a sure way...

547
00:35:50,980 --> 00:35:52,119
The school curriculum...

548
00:35:58,860 --> 00:36:01,029
Yes, director. This is Choi Hyung Sun.

549
00:36:01,589 --> 00:36:05,299
Our dear Ms. Seo is scared to death.

550
00:36:07,199 --> 00:36:10,239
I mean, if you take this to an all-out war,

551
00:36:10,600 --> 00:36:12,439
- it will become a huge hassle. - Why do you need...

552
00:36:12,440 --> 00:36:13,939
- the White Haired Witch's schedule? - I mean...

553
00:36:13,940 --> 00:36:16,109
She was nagging me so much to at least get your schedule...

554
00:36:16,110 --> 00:36:17,939
- for Chanyoung High School. - I'm curious what she wants.

555
00:36:17,940 --> 00:36:19,238
- Goodness. - If it's just Chanyoung High,

556
00:36:19,239 --> 00:36:20,750
- Yes. - or Seo Hye Jin's Chanyoung High.

557
00:36:22,110 --> 00:36:23,880
- Oh, I see. - Ms. Seo.

558
00:36:25,420 --> 00:36:26,650
- I see. - You're not really scared, right?

559
00:36:27,589 --> 00:36:29,520
- Yes, got it. Thank you. - Right.

560
00:36:30,089 --> 00:36:32,588
- No, don't be sorry. No need. - Indeed.

561
00:36:32,589 --> 00:36:34,089
Yes, of course.

562
00:36:35,529 --> 00:36:37,230
Have a good day. Bye.

563
00:36:41,170 --> 00:36:42,299
Gosh.

564
00:36:42,730 --> 00:36:43,940
It's as I expected.

565
00:36:45,500 --> 00:36:46,909
Tuesdays and Saturdays in the evening.

566
00:36:47,409 --> 00:36:49,369
They're the same days and times as Ms. Seo.

567
00:36:49,639 --> 00:36:51,179
And she's even starting her lectures on the same day.

568
00:36:52,009 --> 00:36:53,110
They're also going to teach 10th graders.

569
00:36:55,580 --> 00:36:56,580
Are you smiling?

570
00:36:57,619 --> 00:36:58,880
What will you do now?

571
00:37:00,449 --> 00:37:03,060
You want to avoid an all-out war?

572
00:37:06,889 --> 00:37:08,529
There's no need to be tempted by numbers.

573
00:37:08,830 --> 00:37:11,059
Even though Director Choi is a skilled veteran,

574
00:37:11,060 --> 00:37:12,460
the battle stats between us...

575
00:37:13,500 --> 00:37:14,529
are fairly equal.

576
00:37:14,730 --> 00:37:17,068
Our lecturing skills, reputations, level of books,

577
00:37:17,069 --> 00:37:18,839
and even the grades of the students we teach.

578
00:37:19,600 --> 00:37:21,270
We can't change anything overnight.

579
00:37:21,940 --> 00:37:24,909
But there is one variable that we can change freely.

580
00:37:25,409 --> 00:37:26,880
- The days we teach? - Yes.

581
00:37:28,850 --> 00:37:30,678
Tuesdays and Saturdays...

582
00:37:30,679 --> 00:37:32,650
(Tuesdays, Saturdays, night)

583
00:37:33,619 --> 00:37:35,919
Leaving out the days with Heewon High lectures,

584
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:38,059
the time slots that Director Choi could choose are...

585
00:37:38,060 --> 00:37:40,089
at least 8 and at most 10.

586
00:37:40,330 --> 00:37:43,199
But Director Choi went ahead and chose Tuesdays and Saturdays...

587
00:37:43,360 --> 00:37:46,900
and exactly at the same time slot as my lecture time.

588
00:37:48,429 --> 00:37:49,798
When you said you were scared...

589
00:37:49,799 --> 00:37:51,769
If someone was scared and wanted to go all-in on...

590
00:37:51,770 --> 00:37:53,170
maintaining her Chanyoung High class,

591
00:37:53,610 --> 00:37:56,580
she'd move her class to Wednesday and Sunday evenings, 100 percent.

592
00:37:56,710 --> 00:37:58,638
That's because this is the time slot that Director Choi...

593
00:37:58,639 --> 00:38:01,380
has been teaching Heewon High classes for the past 20 years.

594
00:38:01,679 --> 00:38:03,009
It's the safest time slot.

595
00:38:04,080 --> 00:38:06,020
And if Director Choi predicts that,

596
00:38:06,549 --> 00:38:07,989
she'll change her lecture schedule...

597
00:38:08,219 --> 00:38:09,588
and hold her Chanyoung High classes...

598
00:38:09,589 --> 00:38:11,460
on Wednesday and Sunday evenings.

599
00:38:11,819 --> 00:38:14,230
That's because she's after our Chanyoung High students.

600
00:38:14,389 --> 00:38:15,759
Yes, probably.

601
00:38:17,529 --> 00:38:18,659
Gosh.

602
00:38:19,060 --> 00:38:22,400
But what if the White Haired Witch doesn't move as we predicted?

603
00:38:24,600 --> 00:38:26,509
- Mr. Park. - Yes?

604
00:38:27,239 --> 00:38:28,409
Let's change our schedule.

605
00:38:30,779 --> 00:38:33,679
Move Chanyoung High to Wednesday and Sunday evenings.

606
00:38:34,610 --> 00:38:36,819
But that time slot is when you teach Heewon High classes.

607
00:38:39,850 --> 00:38:42,419
I should let them know that I have no intention of...

608
00:38:42,420 --> 00:38:44,989
adjusting our schedules peacefully.

609
00:38:45,560 --> 00:38:48,029
She won't have any intention of adjusting our schedules peacefully.

610
00:38:49,730 --> 00:38:53,330
Then, we'll leave our Chanyoung High classes as they are,

611
00:38:54,969 --> 00:38:57,969
and we'll go after Director Choi's Heewon High classes.

612
00:38:58,069 --> 00:38:59,069
Yes.

613
00:38:59,199 --> 00:39:01,008
If Director Choi moves her Heewon High classes...

614
00:39:01,009 --> 00:39:02,869
as we predicted,

615
00:39:03,239 --> 00:39:04,639
we'd be able to shake her up a bit,

616
00:39:04,839 --> 00:39:07,449
if not deliver a critical blow.

617
00:39:07,980 --> 00:39:11,619
Without causing any confusion for my Chanyoung High students,

618
00:39:12,080 --> 00:39:13,449
we'd have the upper hand in targeting Heewon High.

619
00:39:14,319 --> 00:39:17,060
And even if Choisun Academy doesn't move as we expected,

620
00:39:17,489 --> 00:39:18,920
we won't lose anything.

621
00:39:27,799 --> 00:39:29,130
This won't be enough.

622
00:39:29,369 --> 00:39:32,069
Gosh, the real part starts after this.

623
00:39:32,170 --> 00:39:33,170
What?

624
00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:36,009
We have another variable that Director Choi doesn't know about.

625
00:39:37,839 --> 00:39:39,409
Come on.

626
00:39:39,909 --> 00:39:41,448
Jun Ho could use a tactic...

627
00:39:41,449 --> 00:39:43,449
that the White Haired Witch would never use.

628
00:39:44,980 --> 00:39:47,219
But that's only one thing.

629
00:39:48,489 --> 00:39:49,520
Free lectures.

630
00:39:49,889 --> 00:39:51,589
A tactic only new lecturers can use.

631
00:40:01,199 --> 00:40:03,739
What do you mean by that? Free lectures?

632
00:40:05,139 --> 00:40:06,299
Mr. Lee.

633
00:40:07,009 --> 00:40:09,069
We want to talk a little more.

634
00:40:11,739 --> 00:40:13,549
Is it something I can't hear?

635
00:40:13,710 --> 00:40:14,779
No.

636
00:40:15,580 --> 00:40:16,679
Please excuse us.

637
00:40:20,989 --> 00:40:22,020
Yes, sir.

638
00:40:29,290 --> 00:40:30,658
- Is today okay? - Yes. Good.

639
00:40:30,659 --> 00:40:31,960
- Then, I'll make reservations. - Okay.

640
00:40:33,369 --> 00:40:34,400
Oh, here he comes.

641
00:40:34,630 --> 00:40:35,699
Mr. Lee.

642
00:40:36,270 --> 00:40:37,299
Yes?

643
00:40:41,839 --> 00:40:43,139
You have time this evening, right?

644
00:40:44,409 --> 00:40:45,440
Today?

645
00:40:45,610 --> 00:40:47,479
All of our teachers have their own schedules,

646
00:40:47,480 --> 00:40:49,150
so we can't have a huge get-together,

647
00:40:49,449 --> 00:40:51,520
but we were going to go and grab drinks with whoever has time.

648
00:40:52,980 --> 00:40:54,020
Come with us.

649
00:40:54,089 --> 00:40:55,920
Oh, but I already have plans for tonight...

650
00:40:56,489 --> 00:40:58,658
Is it perhaps a date?

651
00:40:58,659 --> 00:41:00,130
No, it's not that.

652
00:41:00,659 --> 00:41:01,829
How many are we?

653
00:41:01,830 --> 00:41:02,959
Shall I make the reservation?

654
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:05,529
Wait. We haven't asked Ms. Seo yet.

655
00:41:06,029 --> 00:41:07,630
The sun might set before we decide.

656
00:41:07,869 --> 00:41:10,500
I'll make the reservation and call to add her if we must.

657
00:41:10,900 --> 00:41:13,409
Heewon High School.

658
00:41:14,069 --> 00:41:16,509
Did you have them in mind since then?

659
00:41:16,880 --> 00:41:19,379
Since when I suggested we use Jun Ho as our poster boy?

660
00:41:19,380 --> 00:41:21,979
If I could see that far ahead,

661
00:41:21,980 --> 00:41:24,619
I'd have to change my profession to fortune-telling.

662
00:41:25,549 --> 00:41:26,619
I guess?

663
00:41:26,889 --> 00:41:28,149
I didn't think he'd say something...

664
00:41:28,150 --> 00:41:30,190
as crazy as "teacher and student sally forth."

665
00:41:30,589 --> 00:41:32,818
Even more so that Choisun Academy would come after us.

666
00:41:32,819 --> 00:41:35,089
Honestly, all of that was unexpected.

667
00:41:36,130 --> 00:41:38,830
It is a fantastic idea but...

668
00:41:40,069 --> 00:41:42,170
What were you going to do...

669
00:41:42,630 --> 00:41:44,170
if I objected to the end?

670
00:41:45,299 --> 00:41:47,369
I don't know. I didn't consider that.

671
00:41:48,540 --> 00:41:49,540
Why not?

672
00:41:49,869 --> 00:41:53,040
I just thought Lee Jun Ho would come to me.

673
00:41:53,549 --> 00:41:54,610
It was a hunch.

674
00:41:58,350 --> 00:42:00,149
Do me a favour, director.

675
00:42:00,150 --> 00:42:01,190
What?

676
00:42:01,819 --> 00:42:02,989
Jun Ho.

677
00:42:04,489 --> 00:42:06,489
How about we use him to promote our academy?

678
00:42:08,230 --> 00:42:09,258
Why?

679
00:42:09,259 --> 00:42:11,130
He went to Chanyoung High School.

680
00:42:11,360 --> 00:42:13,298
I'll do my best to keep my students,

681
00:42:13,299 --> 00:42:15,199
but he could be a second line of defence.

682
00:42:17,069 --> 00:42:19,439
You want to announce Chanyoung High's...

683
00:42:19,440 --> 00:42:21,310
- miracle kid is here? - Yes.

684
00:42:21,770 --> 00:42:23,940
It will appeal to the kids with middling or low grades.

685
00:42:29,409 --> 00:42:31,049
My old age is getting to me.

686
00:42:32,380 --> 00:42:34,219
I want to make a conservative decision.

687
00:42:35,150 --> 00:42:37,520
I'm okay with preserving the status quo.

688
00:42:37,889 --> 00:42:39,658
Choi Hyung Sun's 60...

689
00:42:39,659 --> 00:42:41,629
and she's going all out to take me down.

690
00:42:41,630 --> 00:42:42,630
Gosh.

691
00:42:44,259 --> 00:42:46,528
We can't just sit still and defend our position.

692
00:42:46,529 --> 00:42:48,869
I'll teach Jun Ho as best I can.

693
00:42:52,040 --> 00:42:53,069
Goodness.

694
00:42:54,339 --> 00:42:55,940
What else can I do but trust you?

695
00:42:56,270 --> 00:42:57,580
You're Seo Hye Jin.

696
00:42:59,080 --> 00:43:01,549
Oh, and about the free lecture.

697
00:43:02,080 --> 00:43:05,150
We should keep it a secret until the new advertisement goes up.

698
00:43:05,719 --> 00:43:08,349
To give Choisun Academy as little time to fight back.

699
00:43:08,350 --> 00:43:09,790
Yes. Let's do that.

700
00:43:17,500 --> 00:43:19,400
(Daechi Chase)

701
00:43:21,569 --> 00:43:23,770
(Math for Medical Students)

702
00:43:30,179 --> 00:43:31,210
Gosh.

703
00:43:32,310 --> 00:43:34,710
I feel uncomfortable having to tell you this.

704
00:43:35,150 --> 00:43:39,319
But our principal and vice-principal are hearing stuff from other people.

705
00:43:40,719 --> 00:43:42,948
From what I heard,

706
00:43:42,949 --> 00:43:45,389
even our board chairman heard something too.

707
00:43:46,319 --> 00:43:48,759
You say the extra classes for math...

708
00:43:49,830 --> 00:43:53,029
and science are special programs to raise creative minds.

709
00:43:54,400 --> 00:43:55,429
Are those classes...

710
00:43:56,400 --> 00:43:59,400
just fine because they cater to future students of medicine?

711
00:43:59,739 --> 00:44:01,670
You teach Korean.

712
00:44:02,440 --> 00:44:03,540
What do you do?

713
00:44:04,179 --> 00:44:07,380
You have kids read whole passages and share their thoughts.

714
00:44:07,650 --> 00:44:08,880
They think...

715
00:44:09,710 --> 00:44:12,150
that's a bit too much.

716
00:44:12,250 --> 00:44:13,749
There are many things you could teach.

720

has the right to teach independently and autonomously.

721
00:44:25,029 --> 00:44:26,029
That is...

722
00:44:26,799 --> 00:44:28,699

723
00:44:29,170 --> 00:44:30,239

726
00:44:38,380 --> 00:44:41,810
to help students do better in exams.

727
00:44:50,360 --> 00:44:51,560

728
00:44:52,159 --> 00:44:53,690
- Mr. Pyo. - Excuse me.

729

There's no point in dreaming of them as long as Seo Hye Jin's around.

733
00:45:05,770 --> 00:45:07,239
Poor me.

734
00:45:07,670 --> 00:45:08,770
There's no beating her.

735
00:45:09,440 --> 00:45:10,939
Even more so if you teach English.

736
00:45:10,940 --> 00:45:13,338
Do you have to say something so upsetting...

737
00:45:13,339 --> 00:45:14,979
in front of our new hires?

738
00:45:14,980 --> 00:45:16,548
I don't mind. It's fine.

739
00:45:16,549 --> 00:45:17,580
It's not.

740
00:45:18,049 --> 00:45:20,750
You're mostly fine until you sometimes feel hurt.

741
00:45:22,150 --> 00:45:23,989

Are you done for the day?

744
00:45:34,170 --> 00:45:37,400
Yes. I teach at Daechi-dong, so I'm successful now.

745
00:45:38,540 --> 00:45:42,540
I'm still trying to find my bearings.

746
00:45:44,779 --> 00:45:47,380

Did Mr. Pyo Sang Seob of Korean...

748

transfer schools?

749
00:45:54,389 --> 00:45:57,989
I believe he had a year left on his tenure there.

750
00:46:00,759 --> 00:46:01,790
Yes.

751
00:46:06,060 --> 00:46:08,500
Oh, really?

752
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:12,440
At least our academy doesn't resort to cheap tricks.

753
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:14,810
We shouldn't do that too.

754
00:46:16,670 --> 00:46:19,379
Excuse me. Would you mind...

755
00:46:19,380 --> 00:46:21,249
if I go ahead?

756
00:46:21,250 --> 00:46:23,509
What? Ms. Nam.

757
00:46:23,619 --> 00:46:25,948
You said we should drink until we die.

758
00:46:25,949 --> 00:46:28,919

No way.

766

You'll teach part of a three-hour lecture...

Of course.

773

Do they ever give out samples of the best-selling product?

774
00:47:14,330 --> 00:47:15,568
No. You know the taste.

775
00:47:15,569 --> 00:47:17,868

When my grades plateaued for a while,

782
00:47:40,730 --> 00:47:43,060
my mom checked out so many other academies.

783
00:47:43,489 --> 00:47:45,499
I know that. Everyone talked about you.

784

Why?

786
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:53,299
Because you never gave up trying to persuade me or make me understand.

787
00:47:54,639 --> 00:47:55,710

- Ms. Kim. - Yes?

900
00:59:18,060 --> 00:59:19,420
My future class.

901
00:59:20,219 --> 00:59:24,029
Would it be a nuisance to Ms. Seo if I taught Chanyoung High kids?

902
00:59:24,600 --> 00:59:26,560
- Chanyoung High? - Yes.

903
00:59:27,230 --> 00:59:28,429
I think I could do well.

904
00:59:32,270 --> 00:59:35,440
That would be a massive nuisance.

905
00:59:36,639 --> 00:59:40,279
And it won't be a wise decision for you either.

906
00:59:41,480 --> 00:59:43,310
I looked up some material...

907
00:59:43,480 --> 00:59:45,449
and I think I have a competitive edge.

908
00:59:46,520 --> 00:59:49,818
Some academies goad instructors by getting them...

909
00:59:49,819 --> 00:59:52,560
to teach students from the same school,

910
00:59:52,920 --> 00:59:54,290
but we don't recommend that.

911
00:59:55,029 --> 00:59:56,060
I see.

912
00:59:57,799 --> 00:59:59,899
I put together a list of schools...

913
00:59:59,900 --> 01:00:02,770
our existing instructors were too stretched out to cover.

914
01:00:06,670 --> 01:00:08,610
I really want to do this.

915
01:00:10,040 --> 01:00:11,679
I'll help you out.

916
01:00:12,509 --> 01:00:13,580
Mom?

917
01:00:14,339 --> 01:00:16,380
You're home at last.

918
01:00:17,009 --> 01:00:18,150
Why are you out here?

919
01:00:18,449 --> 01:00:21,318
This is an instructor at our academy.

920
01:00:21,319 --> 01:00:23,150
She wanted to ask me something.

921
01:00:24,119 --> 01:00:25,219
This late?

922
01:00:25,759 --> 01:00:28,259
Oh. I should let you go home.

923
01:00:28,360 --> 01:00:30,059
Okay, Ms. Nam.

924
01:00:30,060 --> 01:00:32,299
- See you tomorrow. - Okay.

925
01:00:33,460 --> 01:00:34,670
- Let's go inside. - Okay.

926
01:00:35,069 --> 01:00:38,000
Why do you come home late all the time?

927
01:00:38,600 --> 01:00:40,639
Why? Did you miss me?

928
01:00:41,469 --> 01:00:42,509
Yes.

929
01:00:45,440 --> 01:00:46,509
So what?

930
01:00:53,880 --> 01:00:55,920
What a shame.

931
01:01:45,799 --> 01:01:47,369
Hello, Mr. Lee.

932
01:01:49,909 --> 01:01:52,179
Well? Do you like how it looks?

933
01:01:52,440 --> 01:01:54,080
It's the best.

934
01:01:54,549 --> 01:01:56,349
It couldn't be better than this.

935
01:01:56,350 --> 01:01:58,178
(A teacher and student sally forth)

936
01:01:58,179 --> 01:01:59,219
My gosh.

937
01:02:04,520 --> 01:02:06,520
(A teacher and student sally forth)

938
01:02:08,429 --> 01:02:09,588
(A teacher and student sally forth)

939
01:02:09,589 --> 01:02:10,888
(Daechi Chase's miracle Lee Jun Ho, Main instructor Seo Hye Jin)

940
01:02:10,889 --> 01:02:12,029
(The best Korean lectures so far weren't actually the best!)

941
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:21,000
What?

942
01:02:22,310 --> 01:02:25,540
It would've been nice if you'd given me a heads-up.

943
01:02:26,810 --> 01:02:30,279
Ms. Seo was all about keeping it under wraps.

944
01:02:30,650 --> 01:02:34,178
You know we can't ignore any of her requests.

945
01:02:34,179 --> 01:02:37,190
You should consider how the other instructors will feel.

946
01:02:37,619 --> 01:02:39,089
The other instructors...

947
01:02:39,360 --> 01:02:42,230
have you to talk to and lean on.

948
01:02:46,400 --> 01:02:47,630
There will be a backlash.

949
01:02:49,369 --> 01:02:50,429
A backlash?

950
01:02:51,069 --> 01:02:52,738
They'll understand the reasoning,

951
01:02:52,739 --> 01:02:55,069
but this involves emotions.

952
01:03:00,339 --> 01:03:01,350
Goodness.

953
01:03:03,350 --> 01:03:04,850
Are they even qualified?

954
01:03:07,549 --> 01:03:10,650
Tell them to bring me an outstanding idea...

955
01:03:10,889 --> 01:03:13,318
like that of Seo Hye Jin and Lee Jun Ho,

956
01:03:13,319 --> 01:03:15,429
and I'll willingly spend to build on it.

957
01:03:16,560 --> 01:03:18,230
If they don't want to do that,

958
01:03:18,860 --> 01:03:20,999
tell them to think carefully...

959
01:03:21,000 --> 01:03:22,830
about what will actually benefit them.

960
01:03:24,869 --> 01:03:26,540
"Enjoy the show and eat the leftovers."

961
01:03:28,069 --> 01:03:30,368
I can't tell them that, can I?

962
01:03:30,369 --> 01:03:34,339
You don't have to put it so harshly.

963
01:03:35,350 --> 01:03:37,250
Let's be professional about it.

964
01:03:38,920 --> 01:03:41,250
I know we're supposed to fend for ourselves,

965
01:03:42,589 --> 01:03:44,250
but I can't help but feel let down.

966
01:03:46,520 --> 01:03:47,960
A heads-up would've been nice.

967
01:03:50,929 --> 01:03:52,060
Sorry.

968
01:03:52,500 --> 01:03:54,360
I wanted to tread cautiously.

969
01:03:55,699 --> 01:03:58,699
Don't you care about what's fair and equal anymore?

970
01:04:01,270 --> 01:04:03,409
Consider me a scout of sorts.

971
01:04:05,009 --> 01:04:06,778
You all ended up teaching more students...

972
01:04:06,779 --> 01:04:09,150
by placing classes before and after mine.

973
01:04:09,880 --> 01:04:12,350
Heewon High School is an opportunity for you too.

974
01:04:12,480 --> 01:04:14,749
If you place your classes before and after mine,

975
01:04:14,750 --> 01:04:17,919
you'll have a better chance of starting a Heewon class.

976
01:04:17,920 --> 01:04:19,118
What then?

977
01:04:19,119 --> 01:04:21,690
It won't hurt your careers at all.

978
01:04:21,960 --> 01:04:23,130
Is that a promise?

979
01:04:23,259 --> 01:04:25,359
I'll mention your classes whenever I teach.

980
01:04:25,360 --> 01:04:29,000
And I'll insert your flyers whenever I hand out material.

981
01:04:29,170 --> 01:04:31,368
So don't be too upset about it.

982
01:04:31,369 --> 01:04:34,600
What about me? I teach the same subject as you.

983
01:04:35,469 --> 01:04:37,368
Once I start a Heewon High class,

984
01:04:37,369 --> 01:04:39,679
you can take over my Daesan High class.

985
01:04:41,110 --> 01:04:42,150
Please help me out.

986
01:04:49,949 --> 01:04:52,560
You'd better open a class for Heewon High kids.

987
01:04:52,920 --> 01:04:55,960
I'm angry, so I expect leftovers from your table at least.

988
01:04:56,589 --> 01:04:57,589
Okay.

989
01:05:08,270 --> 01:05:09,610
Are you both well-prepared?

990
01:05:10,509 --> 01:05:11,540
Somewhat?

991
01:05:15,380 --> 01:05:17,779
You know lots of people are watching you, right?

992
01:05:20,520 --> 01:05:23,589
Be fair and keep an eye on the people around you.

993
01:05:24,520 --> 01:05:26,190
That's what I hope you'll do.

994
01:05:26,819 --> 01:05:27,889
That's what I'm doing.

995
01:05:29,489 --> 01:05:30,960
The crown comes with a responsibility.

996
01:05:31,830 --> 01:05:33,630
You should love your fans equally.

997
01:05:38,270 --> 01:05:39,299
How about a coffee?

998
01:06:00,659 --> 01:06:03,089
- Here you go. - Thanks.

999
01:06:06,130 --> 01:06:08,969
I'm not that upset about it.

1000
01:06:10,500 --> 01:06:11,500
Why not?

1001
01:06:13,869 --> 01:06:17,739
I'm reluctant to share because I might look crafty.

1002
01:06:21,549 --> 01:06:23,278
If this works, we'll all benefit...

1003
01:06:23,279 --> 01:06:25,420
from the students Ms. Seo will bring in.

1004
01:06:28,350 --> 01:06:30,790
- What if it fails? - That's the point.

1005
01:06:31,319 --> 01:06:34,159
If you must fail, it's best to do so quietly.

1006
01:06:34,259 --> 01:06:36,158
If she were to fail after stirring things up,

1007
01:06:36,159 --> 01:06:37,389
the damage would be incredible.

1008
01:06:38,060 --> 01:06:41,229
Basically, whether Ms. Seo pulls this off or not,

1009
01:06:41,230 --> 01:06:42,670
we have nothing to lose.

1010
01:06:43,500 --> 01:06:46,569
That's why the other team leaders didn't complain too strenuously.

1011
01:06:48,139 --> 01:06:51,239
Plus, the White Haired Witch started the fight.

1012
01:06:51,909 --> 01:06:53,210
It won't be easy.

1013
01:06:58,380 --> 01:07:01,019
The water to sauce ratio...

1014
01:07:01,020 --> 01:07:02,089
has to be thicker.

1015
01:07:08,360 --> 01:07:09,759
- What's that? - What?

1016
01:07:11,360 --> 01:07:12,799
- Have a taste. - No way.

1017
01:07:13,929 --> 01:07:15,169
What is it?

1018
01:07:15,170 --> 01:07:16,928
- You eat that? - Yes.

1019
01:07:16,929 --> 01:07:18,539
- Stir-fried chicken? - I don't want it.

1020
01:07:18,540 --> 01:07:20,139
Try pork next time.

1021
01:07:22,670 --> 01:07:25,080
He's an ordinary guy who teaches for free.

1022
01:07:25,839 --> 01:07:28,449
The headline's a bit provocative on our part.

1023
01:07:30,080 --> 01:07:31,619
Who is this Lee Jun Ho?

1024
01:07:33,420 --> 01:07:36,150
Seo Hye Jin taught him all through high school.

1025
01:07:36,719 --> 01:07:39,389
He got eighth class in his first high school mock exam,

1026
01:07:39,659 --> 01:07:41,629
and the then college student Seo got him into Korea University.

1027
01:07:41,630 --> 01:07:42,889
It was talk of the town back then.

1028
01:07:44,630 --> 01:07:46,830
I think I remember.

1029
01:07:48,000 --> 01:07:51,199
His mother was famously influential in Daechi-dong at the time,

1030
01:07:51,429 --> 01:07:53,839
and that's how Seo ended up with a Chanyoung High following.

1031
01:07:55,440 --> 01:07:56,710
They helped each other out.

1032
01:07:57,239 --> 01:07:59,238
Well,

1033
01:07:59,239 --> 01:08:02,480
I don't think you need to worry about this too much.

1034
01:08:04,080 --> 01:08:05,480
Mr. Park Ki Sung.

1035
01:08:07,420 --> 01:08:09,389
How long have you worked for me?

1036
01:08:10,750 --> 01:08:12,719
This is my eighth year.

1037
01:08:13,219 --> 01:08:14,290
And...

1038
01:08:16,029 --> 01:08:18,529
you think this is a simple free lecture?

1039
01:08:22,370 --> 01:08:23,798
With one call,

1040
01:08:23,799 --> 01:08:26,138
they made me move my Heewon High classes.

1041
01:08:26,139 --> 01:08:29,008
Then the day my class is scheduled,

1042
01:08:29,009 --> 01:08:32,209
they scheduled this event, three hours before my class starts.

1043
01:08:35,280 --> 01:08:37,179
Does this brazen challenge...

1044
01:08:38,179 --> 01:08:40,079
seem ordinary to you?

1045
01:08:41,520 --> 01:08:42,749
What I meant is,

1046
01:08:43,690 --> 01:08:45,589
it would never succeed.

1047
01:08:46,690 --> 01:08:49,560
Do you know what problem students with low grades have?

1048
01:08:53,999 --> 01:08:56,669
They don't know what it is they don't know.

1049
01:08:59,139 --> 01:09:02,940
Such students must have knowledge beaten into them.

1050
01:09:03,969 --> 01:09:05,110
If you're a teacher.

1051
01:09:06,379 --> 01:09:09,150
The upcoming final exam works in our favour.

1052
01:09:10,350 --> 01:09:11,350
Why?

1053
01:09:11,351 --> 01:09:13,820
Heewon High's midterms focus more on grammar.

1054
01:09:15,049 --> 01:09:16,089
I see.

1055
01:09:16,650 --> 01:09:17,789
It's hard to stand out.

1056
01:09:18,520 --> 01:09:20,459
- I'm off to a class. - Okay.

1057
01:09:28,030 --> 01:09:29,129
Seo Hye Jin speaking.

1058
01:09:29,770 --> 01:09:31,839
It's Choi Hyung Sun from Choisun Academy.

1059
01:09:32,339 --> 01:09:33,370
Goodness.

1060
01:09:33,669 --> 01:09:36,709
We get to speak on the phone before we even meet.

1061
01:09:37,770 --> 01:09:40,579
I'm sorry you had to meet me through a rude advertisement.

1062
01:09:41,410 --> 01:09:42,450
Don't feel sorry.

1063
01:09:45,379 --> 01:09:49,150
I called to ask you to do me a favour.

1064
01:09:49,850 --> 01:09:53,918
I'd like you to do your utmost at the upcoming free lecture.

1065
01:09:53,919 --> 01:09:55,389
That's all I want to say.

1066
01:09:58,730 --> 01:10:02,400
Lots of people teach smaller classes of Heewon High students,

1067
01:10:02,999 --> 01:10:06,700
but it's so hard to find one worth bench-marking.

1068
01:10:07,870 --> 01:10:11,839
I'm hoping what you're planning will provide us with a challenge.

1069
01:10:12,179 --> 01:10:13,810
I called to say that.

1070
01:10:16,079 --> 01:10:19,419
Okay. I look forward to your lecture that caters to...

1071
01:10:20,079 --> 01:10:21,120
Chanyoung High students.

1072
01:10:22,389 --> 01:10:25,089
If you end up opening a full-time class, that is.

1073
01:11:00,060 --> 01:11:03,828
(The Midnight Romance in Hagwon)

1074
01:11:03,829 --> 01:11:05,359
I'll teach Chanyoung High students too.

1075
01:11:05,360 --> 01:11:07,328
- Ms. Nam. - She should have better morals.

1076
01:11:07,329 --> 01:11:09,599
Say that to her face and you'll get shot.

1077
01:11:09,600 --> 01:11:10,668
Ms. Seo.

1078
01:11:10,669 --> 01:11:12,168
What can a 60-year-old do?

1079
01:11:12,169 --> 01:11:13,769
Do we just have to guess what will be in the exam?

1080
01:11:13,770 --> 01:11:15,209
What else must we do for them?

1081
01:11:15,370 --> 01:11:17,509
Do as I say and don't complain. I'm right.

1082
01:11:18,139 --> 01:11:20,078
Seo Hye Jin's lecture will be cancelled.

1083
01:11:20,079 --> 01:11:22,810
What a shame. She'll have worked so hard for it.

1084
01:11:23,179 --> 01:11:25,079
The attendance rate is 99 percent.

1085
01:11:25,219 --> 01:11:27,548
- A memorable triumph. - Let's create one together.

1086
01:11:27,549 --> 01:11:29,019
Did you announce it properly?

1087
01:11:29,020 --> 01:11:31,120
I think the teacher and student lecture will flop.

1088
01:11:31,520 --> 01:11:32,659
Prove that...

1089
01:11:32,660 --> 01:11:34,589
your face is next to mine not because you were favoured.
