(Episode 13)

7
00:00:46,310 --> 00:00:47,779
I understand your decision.

8
00:00:49,279 --> 00:00:50,850
Let me ask you why then.

9
00:00:52,749 --> 00:00:53,819
It's because...

10
00:00:59,359 --> 00:01:00,929
I don't treasure this anymore.

11
00:01:02,329 --> 00:01:03,399
You don't...

12
00:01:04,670 --> 00:01:05,969
treasure this anymore?

13
00:01:06,370 --> 00:01:08,270
Right. Not anymore.

14
00:01:10,770 --> 00:01:12,610
I've learned a lot from you two.

15
00:01:13,209 --> 00:01:15,209
Rather than being content with your current positions,

16
00:01:15,380 --> 00:01:18,410
you pursued your dreams and ambitions, and it impressed me.

17
00:01:19,580 --> 00:01:21,879
- What's your point? - I must grow too.

18
00:01:21,880 --> 00:01:24,050
I'll teach my students without relying on this file.

19
00:01:27,589 --> 00:01:29,720
So you want to take on a new challenge? Good grief.

20
00:01:30,660 --> 00:01:33,190
You're not that young, Ms. Seo.

21
00:01:34,559 --> 00:01:36,000
I could say the same about you two too.

22
00:01:40,369 --> 00:01:41,839
Right. Anyway,

23
00:01:43,300 --> 00:01:45,569
I doubt that we'll ever have a meeting like this again.

24
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:48,479
Let's have a heart-to-heart talk about this.

25
00:01:49,309 --> 00:01:51,409
I want to teach my students the ability to follow...

26
00:01:51,410 --> 00:01:53,610
their university curriculum, so they can have a proper education.

27
00:01:54,319 --> 00:01:56,618
Our job isn't to help them achieve that ability.

28
00:01:56,619 --> 00:01:58,689
Our job is to help them achieve better grades.

29
00:01:58,690 --> 00:02:01,759
I'll try to help them achieve both.

30
00:02:01,959 --> 00:02:03,490
But it will be hard to do while working for you.

31
00:02:06,259 --> 00:02:07,360
I must have...

32
00:02:08,830 --> 00:02:11,330
really thought highly of you, Ms. Seo.

33
00:02:12,299 --> 00:02:15,699
I'm sorry. I kept pestering you instead of accepting your decision.

34
00:02:16,539 --> 00:02:18,069
You gave me more attention than I deserved.

35
00:02:18,410 --> 00:02:19,609
But I'm in a tight spot.

36
00:02:20,310 --> 00:02:22,979
I'm starting to feel a sense of responsibility now.

37
00:02:25,549 --> 00:02:28,350
I have a soft spot for instructors who joined this industry...

38
00:02:29,250 --> 00:02:30,680
at a young age.

39
00:02:31,789 --> 00:02:33,289
Their perspective is limited.

40
00:02:34,049 --> 00:02:35,619
They have a hard time planning out their future...

41
00:02:35,620 --> 00:02:37,019
with a long-term approach.

42
00:02:37,889 --> 00:02:39,288
That happens when they get used to playing...

43
00:02:39,289 --> 00:02:40,930
the boss with young students.

44
00:02:42,859 --> 00:02:44,969
You don't need to feel a sense of responsibility.

45
00:02:44,970 --> 00:02:46,369
I will take care of myself.

46
00:02:46,370 --> 00:02:47,870
I'm just disappointed. That's all.

47
00:02:48,539 --> 00:02:51,340
I see so much room for you to grow.

48
00:02:53,009 --> 00:02:54,069
This file...

49
00:02:54,310 --> 00:02:56,879
which I dedicated my life to was stolen from me.

50
00:02:56,880 --> 00:02:58,279
I lost my senior colleague whom I respected...

51
00:02:58,280 --> 00:02:59,849
and a good competitor too.

52
00:02:59,850 --> 00:03:02,919
If anyone's disappointed right now, it should be me.

53
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:09,960
Gosh. You're so frustrating.

54
00:03:11,889 --> 00:03:13,190
Exactly.

55
00:03:13,789 --> 00:03:16,530
You had a chance to keep those three things.

56
00:03:16,859 --> 00:03:19,600
But you were the one who let that chance go...

57
00:03:21,370 --> 00:03:22,539
because you are so caught up...

58
00:03:22,799 --> 00:03:24,199
in your romantic relationship with your young pupil.

59
00:03:28,509 --> 00:03:29,739
Did I make it sound too hard to understand?

60
00:03:31,079 --> 00:03:33,008
I'm asking you whether or not you would've made...

61
00:03:33,009 --> 00:03:35,250
the same decision even if Mr. Lee wasn't in the picture.

62
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:40,720
Well,

63
00:03:41,190 --> 00:03:43,590
if you don't want to answer that, you don't have to.

64
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:46,788
You must have thought once you gave up the file,

65
00:03:46,789 --> 00:03:48,430
this would be over.

66
00:03:49,859 --> 00:03:51,229
But we're just getting started.

67
00:03:54,940 --> 00:03:58,139
I appreciated listening to your grand perspective...

68
00:03:58,639 --> 00:03:59,739
on education.

69
00:04:01,039 --> 00:04:03,579
I foresee a hectic period ahead of you for many reasons.

70
00:04:04,180 --> 00:04:05,549
Thanks for your concern.

71
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:07,149
Please think about my concerns...

72
00:04:07,150 --> 00:04:09,919
from time to time even if you find yourself on a busy schedule.

73
00:04:11,489 --> 00:04:12,489
If I could,

74
00:04:12,490 --> 00:04:15,489
I wanted to recruit you without damaging your reputation.

75
00:04:20,460 --> 00:04:22,058
I'll start serving your meal.

76
00:04:22,059 --> 00:04:23,100
Okay.

77
00:04:23,429 --> 00:04:24,770
Thank you for the meal.

78
00:04:25,729 --> 00:04:28,169
Please come and see me when things get tough.

79
00:04:28,640 --> 00:04:30,640
What good am I for if I can't share my wisdom?

80
00:05:18,689 --> 00:05:20,320
I'm sure some of you feel this way.

81
00:05:20,850 --> 00:05:24,059
"Gosh. It's hard for me to relate to the fictional characters."

82
00:05:24,489 --> 00:05:25,629
"I guess my left brain is more developed."

83
00:05:27,260 --> 00:05:29,899
It was always those kids who wept and wept...

84
00:05:29,900 --> 00:05:31,830
when Iron Man died in the movie.

85
00:05:34,669 --> 00:05:35,869
From now on,

86
00:05:36,739 --> 00:05:38,510
I won't let you use that cowardly excuse.

87
00:05:39,669 --> 00:05:42,510
If you can cry and laugh while watching dramas and movies,

88
00:05:43,140 --> 00:05:46,379
it means you can also cry profusely after reading Kim So Wol's poem.

89
00:05:47,650 --> 00:05:50,249
I'll make sure the spot where your tear falls...

90
00:05:51,049 --> 00:05:53,320
will lead you to the right answer.

91
00:05:55,489 --> 00:05:56,559
From now on,

92
00:05:57,489 --> 00:05:59,760
focus on the objects flashing through the light...

93
00:06:00,390 --> 00:06:02,200
and listen to the sounds carefully.

94
00:06:06,999 --> 00:06:09,499
- Hello. - Hello.

95
00:06:11,169 --> 00:06:13,340
Mr. Lee is conducting a fun class.

96
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:16,080
Oh, that. I saw that on my way in too.

97
00:06:16,879 --> 00:06:18,548
Well, I'm not sure if it will be fun or not.

98
00:06:18,549 --> 00:06:19,950
But how did he manage to start that class?

99
00:06:20,410 --> 00:06:21,649
It didn't meet the requirements.

100
00:06:21,650 --> 00:06:24,048
Oh, that. At first, they rejected his proposal outright.

101
00:06:24,049 --> 00:06:25,248
Then he tried again and got them to approve it.

102
00:06:25,249 --> 00:06:26,549
Gosh. That sounds even more unusual.

103
00:06:26,789 --> 00:06:28,220
The academy has policies, you know?

104
00:06:28,419 --> 00:06:29,688
If trying again worked, I would've done the same...

105
00:06:29,689 --> 00:06:31,489
to open a prep class for English debate competitions.

106
00:06:31,859 --> 00:06:33,058
If we could have a small-sized class,

107
00:06:33,059 --> 00:06:35,999
we would've hired more social studies instructors.

108
00:06:36,700 --> 00:06:39,429
Then I would finally have some colleagues in my team.

109
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:42,539
Mr. Lee used to work at a conglomerate.

110
00:06:42,640 --> 00:06:44,539
Maybe, he did a fine job with his proposal.

111
00:06:44,609 --> 00:06:45,839
I doubt it was the proposal.

112
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:47,210
He probably did a fine job of using Ms. Seo.

113
00:06:47,809 --> 00:06:48,839
What?

114
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:50,938
We worry whether enough students have signed up for our classes.

115
00:06:50,939 --> 00:06:52,080
It's normal for us to have our classes shut down.

116
00:06:52,410 --> 00:06:54,150
It's odd that he could start his class with a small group.

117
00:06:55,020 --> 00:06:56,650
I doubt that he got that done all on his own.

118
00:06:57,020 --> 00:06:58,649
He's a newbie instructor who joined only a few months ago.

119
00:06:58,650 --> 00:06:59,789
Is that so?

120
00:06:59,850 --> 00:07:01,559
Ms. Seo isn't the type to play favorites.

121
00:07:02,289 --> 00:07:04,289
Right. I don't think that's true.

122
00:07:04,460 --> 00:07:06,590
Ms. Seo was the most opposed to the class.

123
00:07:07,789 --> 00:07:09,229
They had a huge fight.

124
00:07:10,030 --> 00:07:11,770
- Ms. Seo hasn't come to work yet? - It is odd, though.

125
00:07:12,470 --> 00:07:14,229
- No. She has evening classes today. - No way.

126
00:07:16,299 --> 00:07:17,970
Don't pay attention to their gossip.

127
00:07:18,939 --> 00:07:19,939
Okay.

128
00:07:45,429 --> 00:07:46,429
More importantly,

129
00:07:46,430 --> 00:07:49,439
Ms. Seo and Mr. Lee have been on bad terms lately...

130
00:07:50,140 --> 00:07:51,840
after the huge fight in the research room.

131
00:07:57,140 --> 00:07:59,850
Let's meet after class at Night Flight.

132
00:08:00,679 --> 00:08:01,919
Here's what's important.

133
00:08:02,150 --> 00:08:03,548
It's not about memorizing whether a piece was written...

134
00:08:03,549 --> 00:08:04,549
in the 1st or 3rd person.

135
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:06,319
It's important to grasp the perspective...

136
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:07,720
from which the piece was written.

137
00:08:09,220 --> 00:08:10,720
Don't write that down. Look at me.

138
00:08:14,799 --> 00:08:16,700
You know Lee Si Woo from Heewon High School?

139
00:08:19,229 --> 00:08:20,928
He was the reason you found out...

140
00:08:20,929 --> 00:08:22,899
about their secret relationship even we didn't know about?

141
00:08:22,900 --> 00:08:26,809
That kid taught my teaching assistant a lesson.

142
00:08:27,770 --> 00:08:28,780
Get out.

143
00:08:30,109 --> 00:08:32,150
Stay out of my sight forever!

144
00:08:33,150 --> 00:08:35,319
My TA was upset that day...

145
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:36,979
and went out to drink alone.

146
00:08:37,649 --> 00:08:39,889
He happened to go to a regular spot frequented by Seo Hye Jin.

147
00:08:40,690 --> 00:08:41,720
Sir?

148
00:08:42,920 --> 00:08:44,729
I'm sorry, but it's closing time.

149
00:08:48,159 --> 00:08:50,060
Oh, right.

150
00:08:50,830 --> 00:08:53,229
Hey, Honey. I'm on my way out.

151
00:08:53,670 --> 00:08:55,599
You know, if Hye Jin isn't feeling well,

152
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:57,440
you should try to get her to throw up.

153
00:08:58,369 --> 00:08:59,369
What?

154
00:08:59,609 --> 00:09:00,769
Why should we call Mr. Lee?

155
00:09:02,009 --> 00:09:04,509
Okay. A perfect match?

156
00:09:04,710 --> 00:09:05,779
What do you mean?

157
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:08,080
Yes.

158
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:11,249
Gosh. How could you...

159
00:09:12,090 --> 00:09:15,519
After that, it wasn't hard to find out what they were up to.

160
00:09:16,619 --> 00:09:18,790
I could see why you couldn't catch on with their secret relationship.

161
00:09:19,790 --> 00:09:22,529
They're strictly professional when they're in Daechi-dong.

162
00:09:23,300 --> 00:09:25,399
More importantly, their special history as a teacher and a pupil...

163
00:09:26,170 --> 00:09:28,800
must have played a huge part in fooling everyone.

164
00:09:29,540 --> 00:09:32,170
Even if they were together, no one would have suspected them.

165
00:09:33,540 --> 00:09:36,540
When I first met you in your studio,

166
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:39,508
I told you Seo Hye Jin wasn't how she used to be. Remember that?

167
00:09:39,509 --> 00:09:40,580
Of course.

168
00:09:41,050 --> 00:09:42,879
Then were you already aware of their secret relationship?

169
00:09:42,979 --> 00:09:45,550
There's one more person who knows about them.

170
00:09:47,220 --> 00:09:49,590
You have an instructor named Nam Cheong Mi.

171
00:09:49,889 --> 00:09:51,560
She seemed quite useful.

172
00:09:52,659 --> 00:09:54,959
Seeing how the secret hasn't gotten out yet,

173
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:56,129
she knows how to keep a secret too.

174
00:09:59,729 --> 00:10:01,269
Should we go somewhere else?

175
00:10:02,239 --> 00:10:03,738
I think we should find a way...

176
00:10:03,739 --> 00:10:05,909
to utilize this chance to our advantage.

177
00:10:06,769 --> 00:10:09,840
(Closed)

178
00:10:20,619 --> 00:10:21,960
You must have thought...

179
00:10:22,159 --> 00:10:23,920
once you gave up the file, this would be over.

180
00:10:25,430 --> 00:10:26,790
But we're just getting started.

181
00:10:48,450 --> 00:10:49,680
Hey, Ms. Seo.

182
00:10:50,279 --> 00:10:52,619
Yes. I'm in an important meeting. I'm outside.

183
00:10:53,350 --> 00:10:54,619
Yes. Please text me.

184
00:11:05,570 --> 00:11:08,239
All right. Let me sum up your fortune for this year.

185
00:11:08,869 --> 00:11:12,710
"Flowers on an old tree" would be a nice way to put it.

186
00:11:13,340 --> 00:11:15,108
The spring rain will wet the leaves,

187
00:11:15,109 --> 00:11:16,779
and they will bloom.

188
00:11:17,409 --> 00:11:18,909
It won't be a bad year.

189
00:11:19,180 --> 00:11:20,379
Gosh.

190
00:11:20,810 --> 00:11:22,420
I see someone bringing good fortune to you.

191
00:11:23,149 --> 00:11:25,519
Even if you were to face misfortune,

192
00:11:25,749 --> 00:11:27,050
it would turn into good fortune.

193
00:11:28,619 --> 00:11:31,529
That's why I wanted to bring in a new teacher to my academy.

194
00:11:31,590 --> 00:11:32,930
I thought he would bring me good fortune.

195
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:34,790
Who is that?

196
00:11:35,229 --> 00:11:36,300
You know,

197
00:11:37,330 --> 00:11:38,800
the guy who was born in 1977, the Year of the Snake.

198
00:11:39,300 --> 00:11:40,670
The male schoolteacher.

199
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:41,869
I see.

200
00:11:42,369 --> 00:11:43,970
But it didn't work out.

201
00:11:44,139 --> 00:11:45,570
I thought he would bring me good fortune.

202
00:11:49,310 --> 00:11:52,149
If you never crossed paths, how could he bring you good fortune?

203
00:11:54,409 --> 00:11:57,080
Based on my reading of your fortune...

204
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:02,259
I don't see any gold or trees.

205
00:12:02,859 --> 00:12:04,460
So in the month when there's a lot of water,

206
00:12:05,029 --> 00:12:07,560
you may end up worrying about something.

207
00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:12,200
You should be careful around water in the next month.

208
00:12:13,269 --> 00:12:14,800
Of course, I should be careful around water.

209
00:12:22,080 --> 00:12:24,609
Vice-Director Woo Seung Hui will resign soon.

210
00:12:25,009 --> 00:12:26,279
She'll leave with the other instructors.

211
00:12:26,850 --> 00:12:29,850
I don't think we can resolve this by hiring people at the last minute.

212
00:12:30,279 --> 00:12:31,950
I'll tell you the rest in detail when we meet.

213
00:13:09,389 --> 00:13:10,420
Over here.

214
00:13:11,759 --> 00:13:12,790
Hey.

215
00:13:17,259 --> 00:13:20,300
This place feels different in the afternoon.

216
00:13:21,769 --> 00:13:23,769
- Like a different place, right? - Yes.

217
00:13:25,139 --> 00:13:27,810
But is it okay for us to be here when the owner isn't?

218
00:13:29,139 --> 00:13:30,709
I asked him if we could use this place.

219
00:13:30,710 --> 00:13:32,310
I needed a place where only the two of us could talk.

220
00:13:33,050 --> 00:13:34,050
Only the two of us?

221
00:13:34,749 --> 00:13:36,820
Did your meeting with the scary ladies go wrong?

222
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:43,690
Well, how was your first class? Did you do a good job?

223
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:44,960
Yes.

224
00:13:46,029 --> 00:13:47,060
How did the students react?

225
00:13:47,430 --> 00:13:48,430
Well...

226
00:13:49,300 --> 00:13:50,330
They were unfamiliar with it.

227
00:13:51,029 --> 00:13:52,100
But they had fun.

228
00:13:54,070 --> 00:13:55,070
That's a relief.

229
00:14:02,379 --> 00:14:03,540
What is it? What's wrong?

230
00:14:06,249 --> 00:14:08,479
Wait. You're really starting to worry me.

231
00:14:09,220 --> 00:14:11,220
What is it? Did something happen?

232
00:14:12,590 --> 00:14:13,619
Jun Ho.

233
00:14:14,450 --> 00:14:15,920
Yes. Tell me.

234
00:14:22,399 --> 00:14:23,729
We got caught.

235
00:14:28,499 --> 00:14:29,970
Director Choi Hyung Sun...

236
00:14:31,499 --> 00:14:32,909
and Vice-Director Woo Seung Hui...

237
00:14:34,139 --> 00:14:35,210
know...

238
00:14:37,609 --> 00:14:38,680
about us.

239
00:14:48,759 --> 00:14:51,659
Gosh. It feels wrong because the owner isn't here.

240
00:14:52,060 --> 00:14:53,460
But he wouldn't mind if I got some water, right?

241
00:15:31,430 --> 00:15:34,229
I came up with an idea on my way here.

242
00:15:34,999 --> 00:15:37,940
"Housemistress B and Love Letters." What do you think?

243
00:15:38,869 --> 00:15:41,570
I'm a director, but I'm also a Korean teacher.

244
00:15:43,409 --> 00:15:46,149
A female teacher who never had a proper relationship...

245
00:15:46,479 --> 00:15:48,950
gets infatuated by her young pupil?

246
00:15:49,450 --> 00:15:52,290
I've only seen Mr. Lee in the pictures.

247
00:15:52,820 --> 00:15:56,060
He looked like the perfect man for this kind of story to me.

248
00:15:57,859 --> 00:15:58,930
Well...

249
00:15:59,759 --> 00:16:01,329
Seo Hye Jin has so much power...

250
00:16:01,330 --> 00:16:03,060
that even the director must tiptoe around her.

251
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:05,369
To seduce the young instructor,

252
00:16:05,499 --> 00:16:07,369
she abused her power.

253
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:09,040
How vulgar that sounds...

254
00:16:09,869 --> 00:16:12,840
especially for the leader of an organization and an educator.

255
00:16:13,609 --> 00:16:15,739
They must have known that. That's why they kept it down-low.

256
00:16:17,710 --> 00:16:20,550
Once this distasteful scandal hits the streets of Daechi-dong,

257
00:16:21,379 --> 00:16:23,320
Seo Hye Jin's career will be finished.

258
00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:25,450
Naturally, Kim Hyun Tak will be gone from our industry too.

259
00:16:28,619 --> 00:16:29,720
Here's the key point.

260
00:16:30,859 --> 00:16:33,790
Who will be the one spreading this gossip?

261
00:16:34,129 --> 00:16:36,659
If the source came from someone who worked with Seo Hye Jin before,

262
00:16:36,729 --> 00:16:37,999
it would be more effective.

263
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:48,509
Can you think of the perfect person for it?

264
00:16:57,320 --> 00:17:00,350
What do you plan to do with Seo Hye Jin's materials?

265
00:17:00,749 --> 00:17:03,290
I'm thinking about giving it to Ms. Nam Cheong Mi.

266
00:17:04,359 --> 00:17:06,790
She already turned a blind eye to their romantic relationship,

267
00:17:07,229 --> 00:17:08,899
so I must use a different bait on her.

268
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:15,030
Can I tell you...

269
00:17:16,369 --> 00:17:17,500
what I've been thinking?

270
00:17:20,810 --> 00:17:23,379
This is worse than your materials getting stolen, right?

271
00:17:25,810 --> 00:17:26,810
Correct.

272
00:17:28,149 --> 00:17:29,780
There will be waves of bombs going off around us.

273
00:17:32,250 --> 00:17:34,090
This scandal won't go away...

274
00:17:35,659 --> 00:17:36,959
even if a few instructors quit. Right?

275
00:17:37,859 --> 00:17:38,889
Right.

276
00:17:40,689 --> 00:17:42,100
Woo Seung Hui and Choi Hyung Sun.

277
00:17:42,330 --> 00:17:44,030
I got on...

278
00:17:46,570 --> 00:17:47,669
their bad side.

279
00:17:49,699 --> 00:17:50,899
The timing couldn't have been worse.

280
00:17:53,869 --> 00:17:56,879
I insisted on starting a class that was against the policy.

281
00:17:58,850 --> 00:18:00,378
We started this, so one of our students...

282
00:18:00,379 --> 00:18:01,609
could be ranked number one in Korea.

283
00:18:02,580 --> 00:18:03,719
But look where our ambition led us.

284
00:18:08,889 --> 00:18:09,889
It's okay.

285
00:18:10,419 --> 00:18:11,459
It's not your fault.

286
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:17,429
I'm not sure if what I'm about to ask is the right question.

287
00:18:19,969 --> 00:18:21,230
Are you going to deny it?

288
00:18:21,899 --> 00:18:23,600
Are you going to say it's a rumor? That it's not true?

289
00:18:29,980 --> 00:18:31,010
I can understand that.

290
00:18:32,149 --> 00:18:33,550
You have so much to lose.

291
00:18:33,909 --> 00:18:34,909
It's not that.

292
00:18:40,689 --> 00:18:41,719
I want to tackle this issue...

293
00:18:42,889 --> 00:18:44,619
with complete honesty.

294
00:18:45,730 --> 00:18:48,129
I might have to tell 10 lies to cover up 1 lie.

295
00:18:48,600 --> 00:18:50,560
I don't want to do that. But...

296
00:18:54,530 --> 00:18:55,899
I need your permission.

297
00:18:56,439 --> 00:18:57,800
Why do you need my permission?

298
00:18:58,500 --> 00:19:00,510
I never wanted to date secretly, to begin with.

299
00:19:06,350 --> 00:19:07,409
Because I feel sorry.

300
00:19:09,679 --> 00:19:11,020
Mr. Lee.

301
00:19:11,750 --> 00:19:14,119
You're competent and brave,

302
00:19:14,750 --> 00:19:15,859
and you have a promising future.

303
00:19:17,359 --> 00:19:18,629
On top of that, you're young.

304
00:19:22,459 --> 00:19:24,359
Because you're involved with me,

305
00:19:24,560 --> 00:19:26,300
we'll face the nastiest gossip.

306
00:19:36,740 --> 00:19:38,240
I don't understand what you're doing.

307
00:19:40,580 --> 00:19:42,419
Why are you filling out my report card all of a sudden?

308
00:19:44,350 --> 00:19:47,350
"This student has achieved excellent grades, is brave,"

309
00:19:47,550 --> 00:19:49,458
- "and has a promising future." - That's not what I'm doing.

310
00:19:49,459 --> 00:19:50,490
Then...

311
00:19:55,060 --> 00:19:56,530
just say that you love me.

312
00:20:14,780 --> 00:20:15,850
I...

313
00:20:19,020 --> 00:20:21,290
Could you go out and get me some tea?

314
00:20:22,959 --> 00:20:24,260
Director Kim will be here soon.

315
00:20:29,659 --> 00:20:30,959
How much does he know?

316
00:20:32,230 --> 00:20:34,300
He only knows about the Vice-Director's secret plan.

317
00:20:35,169 --> 00:20:36,570
I haven't told him about us yet.

318
00:20:37,899 --> 00:20:39,439
You wanted to tell him after you got my permission?

319
00:20:41,040 --> 00:20:42,080
Yes.

320
00:20:47,179 --> 00:20:48,678
Hello, Ms. Woo.

321
00:20:48,679 --> 00:20:52,290
Yes, hello.

322
00:20:52,350 --> 00:20:54,320
Then, since the information session will be a lot to deal with,

323
00:20:54,619 --> 00:20:56,688
- you should prepare ahead of time. - Yes, sir.

324
00:20:56,689 --> 00:20:58,619
Hey, there. Mr. Yoon Ji Seok?

325
00:20:58,859 --> 00:21:00,290
Yes, Ms. Woo. Are you just coming to work?

326
00:21:02,129 --> 00:21:03,959
- You must've had a team meeting. - Yes, ma'am.

327
00:21:05,159 --> 00:21:06,899
I see. You're hard at work.

328
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:08,800
Yes. Well, then...

329
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:10,740
- Mr. Yoon. - Yes?

330
00:21:11,469 --> 00:21:14,010
Do you have classes today?

331
00:21:14,270 --> 00:21:16,208
I have 1 class. It ends at 7pm.

332
00:21:16,209 --> 00:21:17,439
That's perfect.

333
00:21:17,510 --> 00:21:19,780
If you don't have any plans, would you like to have dinner with me?

334
00:21:21,179 --> 00:21:24,149
- Oh, right. Okay, then. - Okay.

335
00:21:24,350 --> 00:21:27,619
You should've told me this a little sooner.

336
00:21:28,090 --> 00:21:31,020
You should've told me when you found out that your materials were stolen.

337
00:21:31,389 --> 00:21:34,129
Then, the materials would've gone into someone else's hands,

338
00:21:34,159 --> 00:21:37,000
and the vice-director would've gladly taken the teachers and left.

339
00:21:37,899 --> 00:21:39,629
- Oh, also... - But one thing we can rely on...

340
00:21:40,429 --> 00:21:42,899
is that the vice-director isn't a virtuous person.

341
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,709
But aren't I a better person than her?

342
00:21:46,010 --> 00:21:48,070
Well, the thing is...

343
00:21:48,740 --> 00:21:50,909
There's something I wasn't able to tell you over text.

344
00:22:00,649 --> 00:22:02,290
- Oh, hey. - Hello.

345
00:22:05,689 --> 00:22:06,689
Coffee.

346
00:22:28,580 --> 00:22:29,618
Did you get caught?

347
00:22:29,619 --> 00:22:30,820
- What? - What?

348
00:22:31,949 --> 00:22:34,320
The two of you. Your relationship.

349
00:22:35,790 --> 00:22:37,060
Did the vice-director find out?

350
00:22:37,389 --> 00:22:38,759
But what are you...

351
00:22:38,760 --> 00:22:41,389
But how did you know...

352
00:22:42,429 --> 00:22:43,830
Darn it!

353
00:22:44,530 --> 00:22:45,770
Darn it.

354
00:22:46,169 --> 00:22:47,499
- Gosh, that's hot! - Goodness.

355
00:22:47,500 --> 00:22:48,698
Darn it.

356
00:22:48,699 --> 00:22:50,169
But did you know about us?

357
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:55,168
This is why I was trying to scout Mr. Pyo Sang Seob.

358
00:22:55,169 --> 00:22:57,179
- But what about him? - Darn it.

359
00:22:59,010 --> 00:23:00,449
I was going to hand him the Chanyoung High classes...

360
00:23:01,709 --> 00:23:04,580
and promote you to keep the two of you apart.

361
00:23:04,879 --> 00:23:06,148
You were spending so much time together...

362
00:23:06,149 --> 00:23:07,189
with the joint lecture and whatnot.

363
00:23:08,149 --> 00:23:09,188
Darn it.

364
00:23:09,189 --> 00:23:11,459
Hang on. So...

365
00:23:12,359 --> 00:23:14,658
How... When... Since when did you...

366
00:23:14,659 --> 00:23:16,030
What do you mean, since when?

367
00:23:16,429 --> 00:23:18,500
I knew that you two would cause trouble.

368
00:23:19,230 --> 00:23:20,429
And when Jun Ho...

369
00:23:20,929 --> 00:23:23,340
suddenly appeared with you at Yangjaecheon, I had my suspicions.

370
00:23:24,899 --> 00:23:28,669
And when I heard that Seo Hye Jin refused Choisun Academy's terms,

371
00:23:29,109 --> 00:23:30,280
I became certain.

372
00:23:31,879 --> 00:23:34,679
But all of that was before we started dating.

373
00:23:34,879 --> 00:23:36,219
My goodness.

374
00:23:37,219 --> 00:23:39,449
I've only directed romance movies.

375
00:23:39,850 --> 00:23:41,689
The tension between two people right before they get together...

376
00:23:41,889 --> 00:23:43,290
is the real deal.

377
00:23:43,619 --> 00:23:45,359
A sizzling cauldron of desire.

378
00:23:46,889 --> 00:23:48,730
Seo Hye Jin was the first to fill...

379
00:23:49,030 --> 00:23:52,000
all of the spots in her special lectures for the vacation.

380
00:23:53,369 --> 00:23:56,699
No one can compete when it comes to bringing in a steady profit.

381
00:23:59,010 --> 00:24:00,709
You usually look those over at the end of the month.

382
00:24:00,810 --> 00:24:01,840
Why are you looking through them now?

383
00:24:02,070 --> 00:24:04,179
Is Ms. Nam Cheong Mi in a lecture now?

384
00:24:05,379 --> 00:24:06,909
Yes, she should be done soon.

385
00:24:07,149 --> 00:24:08,350
Why do you ask?

386
00:24:09,820 --> 00:24:12,219
Seo Hye Jin may be the top in terms of stability,

387
00:24:14,119 --> 00:24:17,060
but Nam Cheong Mi is the top in terms of rate of increase.

388
00:24:20,389 --> 00:24:22,899
Yes, she's very capable.

389
00:24:24,600 --> 00:24:26,530
She has a lot of ambition,

390
00:24:26,869 --> 00:24:28,698
and her textbooks are packed with good information.

391
00:24:28,699 --> 00:24:29,840
She has lots of good reviews.

392
00:24:33,570 --> 00:24:35,439
I got the report from the consultation room.

393
00:24:35,570 --> 00:24:37,580
I hear the free lecture has good responses.

394
00:24:38,980 --> 00:24:40,080
That's good news.

395
00:24:40,609 --> 00:24:42,750
I was worried that I might cause you harm.

396
00:24:43,480 --> 00:24:45,149
Your lecture left quite an impression.

397
00:24:47,619 --> 00:24:50,060
It wasn't that bad as your debut lecture,

398
00:24:50,990 --> 00:24:53,389
but you can't do that from now on.

399
00:25:01,530 --> 00:25:02,668
These are the materials...

400
00:25:02,669 --> 00:25:05,270
that we made while preparing for Chanyoung High classes.

401
00:25:09,439 --> 00:25:11,840
Don't worry. We didn't steal these.

402
00:25:13,480 --> 00:25:15,649
My teaching assistants and I worked hard for about three weeks...

403
00:25:15,949 --> 00:25:17,520
to make these.

404
00:25:18,419 --> 00:25:20,689
I may not seem like it, but I'm the hard-working type.

405
00:25:20,919 --> 00:25:23,320
Yes, I thought you might be.

406
00:25:24,889 --> 00:25:26,730
We must bring all of the kids...

407
00:25:27,590 --> 00:25:29,530
who enter Chanyoung High School.

408
00:25:30,699 --> 00:25:33,570
Throw out what you did for the free lecture last time,

409
00:25:34,230 --> 00:25:35,600
and you should use these as a reference for now.

410
00:25:36,939 --> 00:25:38,340
Don't lecturers at academies...

411
00:25:39,510 --> 00:25:40,909
have the right...

412
00:25:41,709 --> 00:25:43,840
to teach classes the way they want to,

413
00:25:45,240 --> 00:25:46,280
freely?

414
00:25:54,449 --> 00:25:57,060
Today will be the last day I listen to you...

415
00:25:57,590 --> 00:25:59,030
go on about such frustrating things.

416
00:26:00,889 --> 00:26:02,159
The virtue of a lecturer at an academy...

417
00:26:02,760 --> 00:26:05,199
is to earn a lot of money,

418
00:26:05,659 --> 00:26:06,830
freely.

419
00:26:22,679 --> 00:26:24,949
Don't you take your phone into the classroom during your lecture?

420
00:26:25,379 --> 00:26:27,189
Why would I take my phone into a lecture?

421
00:26:29,219 --> 00:26:31,589
In order to scold the kids who won't focus like crazy,

422
00:26:31,590 --> 00:26:33,189
I have to focus first myself.

423
00:26:34,760 --> 00:26:37,760
So, I've been curious for a while now.

424
00:26:38,159 --> 00:26:41,199
You don't have to work so hard like crazy, do you?

425
00:26:44,369 --> 00:26:46,469
I'm sorry if you didn't like the way I said that.

426
00:26:46,609 --> 00:26:47,740
I won't say it anymore.

427
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:49,379
No, that's not what I mean.

428
00:26:50,609 --> 00:26:54,449
I just meant that it was about time you got used to this neighborhood.

429
00:27:00,189 --> 00:27:02,350
That's making me even more confused about what you mean.

430
00:27:02,689 --> 00:27:06,060
The kids in this neighborhood are known to be gentle and hardworking.

431
00:27:06,760 --> 00:27:09,260
I'm not sure what the kids were like at your last place,

432
00:27:09,429 --> 00:27:12,030
but you don't have to scold the kids like that.

433
00:27:20,040 --> 00:27:21,810
I've been curious about this for a while too.

434
00:27:23,580 --> 00:27:26,379
You settled down in this neighborhood before me, right?

435
00:27:27,209 --> 00:27:29,419
So, you have a good hold on the kids from Yeongeun Arts High.

436
00:27:29,879 --> 00:27:31,320
- Right. - Right.

437
00:27:31,750 --> 00:27:32,949
But if I...

438
00:27:34,550 --> 00:27:36,559
target that school like crazy,

439
00:27:36,560 --> 00:27:38,060
who would the kids follow?

440
00:27:39,159 --> 00:27:42,500
Are you sure you know the kids from this neighborhood better than me?

441
00:27:44,300 --> 00:27:45,300
Truly?

442
00:27:47,270 --> 00:27:49,169
I was just making a joke. Why are you being so serious?

443
00:27:50,300 --> 00:27:51,639
Did I upset you?

444
00:27:52,139 --> 00:27:53,139
Yes.

445
00:27:54,639 --> 00:27:56,040
If you were upset, sorry.

446
00:27:58,480 --> 00:28:00,309
I don't care...

447
00:28:00,310 --> 00:28:01,909
whichever way you teach.

448
00:28:04,179 --> 00:28:05,719
But don't belittle effort.

449
00:28:06,990 --> 00:28:09,659
How can you tell kids to study with an attitude like that?

450
00:28:10,490 --> 00:28:12,659
What logic can you use to tell them to bet their lives on studying?

451
00:28:14,429 --> 00:28:15,459
What?

452
00:28:16,929 --> 00:28:18,459
I'm going to go to my lecture now.

453
00:28:21,369 --> 00:28:24,698
I'm someone who's working like crazy to get to a higher position.

454
00:28:24,699 --> 00:28:26,570
So, you can stop...

455
00:28:28,310 --> 00:28:29,540
giving me advice now.

456
00:28:40,790 --> 00:28:43,560
Please come to my office when you're done with your lecture.

457
00:28:46,689 --> 00:28:48,629
- You were still here. - Hello.

458
00:28:48,760 --> 00:28:49,830
Yes. Hello.

459
00:28:51,330 --> 00:28:53,300
- Oh, make yourselves at home. - Oh, thank you.

460
00:29:00,840 --> 00:29:03,879
Jun Ho, will you go and help him out?

461
00:29:04,310 --> 00:29:06,209
I'll just talk to Director Kim for a minute.

462
00:29:14,350 --> 00:29:16,659
Sir, let me help you.

463
00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:19,429
But what brings you here at this time of the day?

464
00:29:20,689 --> 00:29:21,689
Oh, well...

465
00:29:24,830 --> 00:29:26,570
Ms. Seo and I have been caught.

466
00:29:26,800 --> 00:29:27,800
What?

467
00:29:28,469 --> 00:29:29,469
Gosh.

468
00:29:30,639 --> 00:29:33,840
And it was by people who only wish us to fail.

469
00:29:36,340 --> 00:29:37,340
What...

470
00:29:39,280 --> 00:29:42,080
Okay, then just deny it first.

471
00:29:44,719 --> 00:29:46,350
I'm sorry that things turned out this way.

472
00:29:47,449 --> 00:29:49,119
Thanks for sending Jun Ho away.

473
00:29:49,260 --> 00:29:52,760
Gosh, I'm exhausted from acting like everything is okay.

474
00:29:53,330 --> 00:29:54,330
Sorry.

475
00:29:56,800 --> 00:29:59,629
You can guess how things will go from here, can't you?

476
00:30:02,129 --> 00:30:03,199
Yes.

477
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:05,169
It won't end with...

478
00:30:05,439 --> 00:30:07,439
a huge fight within the academy.

479
00:30:09,169 --> 00:30:10,879
I'm sure she didn't mean for it to end there.

480
00:30:12,909 --> 00:30:13,980
Right.

481
00:30:15,850 --> 00:30:17,020
Ms. Seo.

482
00:30:17,919 --> 00:30:19,990
You will be doused in nasty water.

483
00:30:25,290 --> 00:30:26,330
I know.

484
00:30:26,689 --> 00:30:29,330
Do you remember something I told you a while back?

485
00:30:30,760 --> 00:30:33,300
That Jun Ho was always there...

486
00:30:34,270 --> 00:30:35,800
in the pivotal moments of our lives.

487
00:30:36,369 --> 00:30:37,469
I remember.

488
00:30:39,169 --> 00:30:40,169
I am...

489
00:30:41,139 --> 00:30:44,080
very grateful for the two of you.

490
00:30:45,010 --> 00:30:46,209
And with that,

491
00:30:46,580 --> 00:30:49,050
I dreamed of growing the academy.

492
00:30:51,080 --> 00:30:52,689
I don't want to resent the two of you.

493
00:30:54,350 --> 00:30:56,119
It might sound cowardly,

494
00:30:56,659 --> 00:30:59,790
but let's act dumb and pretend like we know nothing about it.

495
00:31:00,230 --> 00:31:01,530
That you two aren't in that kind of relationship.

496
00:31:03,199 --> 00:31:05,830
I'll connect Jun Ho to an even bigger academy.

497
00:31:13,439 --> 00:31:15,169
You can just say that you love me.

498
00:31:19,780 --> 00:31:20,980
Seo Hye Jin.

499
00:31:27,090 --> 00:31:28,949
- Director Kim. - Yes.

500
00:31:33,790 --> 00:31:36,560
I'll go ahead and get doused in nasty water.

501
00:31:38,129 --> 00:31:39,158
Hye Jin.

502
00:31:39,159 --> 00:31:41,070
It's not a rumor that can be stopped with a lie.

503
00:31:41,929 --> 00:31:44,070
And if I insist that just so I can survive,

504
00:31:44,300 --> 00:31:45,939
it'll only make Jun Ho seem like a weird person.

505
00:31:47,139 --> 00:31:48,740
He will seem like a guy who's so crazy about success,

506
00:31:49,409 --> 00:31:51,279
and only focused on doing what he wants,

507
00:31:51,280 --> 00:31:52,639
that he even seduced me.

508
00:31:53,050 --> 00:31:54,080
That is...

509
00:31:56,250 --> 00:31:57,449
I don't want to do that.

510
00:32:01,350 --> 00:32:05,159
I never thought my performance was that great.

511
00:32:06,459 --> 00:32:08,090
We have the data.

512
00:32:08,730 --> 00:32:10,659
Thank you for viewing me in high regard.

513
00:32:12,199 --> 00:32:14,300
But I know better than anyone what I have done.

514
00:32:15,230 --> 00:32:17,000
The reason my sales jumped a lot in the first month...

515
00:32:17,669 --> 00:32:20,069
was because Ms. Seo gave me her 11th grade class...

516
00:32:20,070 --> 00:32:21,409
of Chanyoung High kids.

517
00:32:21,770 --> 00:32:23,639
You can accept this much of a compliment.

518
00:32:24,540 --> 00:32:26,039
There are plenty of teachers...

519
00:32:26,040 --> 00:32:27,649
who can't hold onto classes that academies put together for them.

520
00:32:28,850 --> 00:32:30,850
But I didn't really accomplish that on my own.

521
00:32:32,990 --> 00:32:35,419
I want to become successful with a class I put together.

522
00:32:35,820 --> 00:32:37,060
Here, in Daechi-dong.

523
00:32:38,520 --> 00:32:41,530
I like your performance now and your aspiration.

524
00:32:42,659 --> 00:32:45,428
Then, the academy should give you...

525
00:32:45,429 --> 00:32:48,270
the kind of support that suits you.

526
00:32:53,510 --> 00:32:55,639
I don't have any particular complaints, though.

527
00:32:56,780 --> 00:32:59,209
At the academy I taught at before, I had to clean the classroom myself.

528
00:33:02,820 --> 00:33:05,750
Gosh, don't compare us to such a lousy place as that.

529
00:33:06,449 --> 00:33:09,219
Are you satisfied with having someone else clean the classroom?

530
00:33:09,859 --> 00:33:10,990
That's not true.

531
00:33:11,520 --> 00:33:12,520
Well,

532
00:33:13,760 --> 00:33:16,600
a situation where you have to clean the classroom yourself...

533
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:18,199
might come again.

534
00:33:19,260 --> 00:33:20,270
Pardon?

535
00:33:21,030 --> 00:33:24,139
Seo Hye Jin started out cleaning classrooms herself too.

536
00:33:24,899 --> 00:33:27,340
If the academy shrinks down to the size it was back then...

537
00:33:31,080 --> 00:33:33,709
I'm not exactly sure what you mean.

538
00:33:36,919 --> 00:33:40,490
I mean this academy will soon become a sinking ship.

539
00:33:41,590 --> 00:33:44,089
And you will be able to board a cruise ship...

540
00:33:44,090 --> 00:33:47,090
and have the most Chanyoung High students under your command.

541
00:33:49,429 --> 00:33:52,629
Of course, it's up to you to decide.

542
00:34:00,169 --> 00:34:02,169
(24-hour Sauna, Top Reading)

543
00:34:15,119 --> 00:34:16,619
You're going home early.

544
00:34:16,690 --> 00:34:18,460
Yes, I'm meeting someone.

545
00:34:19,259 --> 00:34:20,489
That's a good thing.

546
00:34:21,429 --> 00:34:23,500
It seemed like you didn't have very many people around you.

547
00:34:23,630 --> 00:34:25,460
That always weighed on my mind.

548
00:34:30,739 --> 00:34:32,199
People are assets.

549
00:34:33,009 --> 00:34:34,639
I learned that from you, sir.

550
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:40,080
If I ask you who you're going to meet,

551
00:34:40,779 --> 00:34:43,449
would it be an invasion of privacy or something like that?

552
00:34:44,080 --> 00:34:46,549
I'm having dinner with Mr. Yoon Ji Seok.

553
00:34:47,690 --> 00:34:50,690
I thought he might need some encouragement.

554
00:34:51,219 --> 00:34:52,290
I see.

555
00:34:52,520 --> 00:34:53,560
Bye, then.

556
00:35:05,699 --> 00:35:06,770
Mr. Yoon Ji Seok?

557
00:35:22,619 --> 00:35:23,920
Why is it Mr. Yoon Ji Seok?

558
00:35:24,259 --> 00:35:26,259
I'm going to my lecture now. Let's talk later.

559
00:35:26,989 --> 00:35:28,889
I'll talk to Ms. Nam.

560
00:35:29,489 --> 00:35:30,900
I think it might be good to let her know in advance.

561
00:35:31,230 --> 00:35:32,330
- Okay. - Bye.

562
00:35:33,299 --> 00:35:35,299
- Gosh. - Here you go.

563
00:35:38,969 --> 00:35:40,610
- Do you need something else? - Makgeolli.

564
00:35:40,810 --> 00:35:42,809
- I'll get that for you. - Hey.

565
00:35:42,810 --> 00:35:44,908
- Welcome. - Hey, there.

566
00:35:44,909 --> 00:35:46,009
Thank you.

567
00:35:46,279 --> 00:35:48,909
- It's been way too long. - I know.

568
00:35:48,949 --> 00:35:50,850
Gosh, you're looking good.

569
00:35:51,650 --> 00:35:54,150
Look who's talking. You've gotten so much cooler.

570
00:35:54,489 --> 00:35:55,888
You look like a real head counselor.

571
00:35:55,889 --> 00:35:57,488
Of course, I'm a real head counselor.

572
00:35:57,489 --> 00:35:59,730
- What are you saying? - I can tell.

573
00:36:00,830 --> 00:36:02,789
Gosh, I've been meaning to meet with you,

574
00:36:02,790 --> 00:36:04,759
- but why is that so hard to do? - I know, right?

575
00:36:04,900 --> 00:36:07,969
It took too long to become free from my husband and son.

576
00:36:10,369 --> 00:36:12,400
Let's order some food. You must be hungry after work.

577
00:36:12,639 --> 00:36:15,710
Excuse me. Here.

578
00:36:17,080 --> 00:36:20,850
You know how he is. And he speaks so smoothly.

579
00:36:21,580 --> 00:36:22,779
He says to trust him.

580
00:36:23,150 --> 00:36:25,520
"I'm doing this so I don't live off of my parents."

581
00:36:25,580 --> 00:36:27,549
As I listen to him say that, it sounds pretty convincing.

582
00:36:28,750 --> 00:36:31,888
So I just go to bed, thinking I should just do as he says.

583
00:36:31,889 --> 00:36:34,560
But then, I get worried about all sorts of things again.

584
00:36:36,500 --> 00:36:39,630
I bet it's not that easy to accept wholeheartedly.

585
00:36:40,529 --> 00:36:41,569
Fine.

586
00:36:41,830 --> 00:36:43,399
I said, "Since you've decided to do this,"

587
00:36:43,400 --> 00:36:46,069
"why don't you go and work at a large academy?" But then,

588
00:36:46,969 --> 00:36:49,239
he was so mad that he was fuming.

589
00:36:49,940 --> 00:36:51,880
Jun Ho can be like that.

590
00:36:52,409 --> 00:36:53,409
Gosh.

591
00:36:53,949 --> 00:36:56,779
Should I really just act dumb and trust him?

592
00:36:57,619 --> 00:36:58,920
You know,

593
00:37:00,790 --> 00:37:02,919
it is my job to tell others what to do...

594
00:37:02,920 --> 00:37:04,259
about their kids,

595
00:37:05,360 --> 00:37:06,790
but it's a bit awkward to say this.

596
00:37:07,159 --> 00:37:08,389
Tell me honestly.

597
00:37:08,790 --> 00:37:11,699
It's because we really can't tell what that kid is thinking.

598
00:37:12,929 --> 00:37:14,869
"Is working at the company too hard?"

599
00:37:16,029 --> 00:37:17,939
We even thought about dipping into our savings...

600
00:37:17,940 --> 00:37:19,069
to send him to study abroad.

601
00:37:19,839 --> 00:37:21,040
Then,

602
00:37:21,569 --> 00:37:24,339
just take note of what I say as my personal opinion.

603
00:37:26,679 --> 00:37:28,049
Just keep watching him.

604
00:37:28,750 --> 00:37:29,750
What?

605
00:37:30,080 --> 00:37:32,250
Your son is no average Joe.

606
00:37:34,549 --> 00:37:35,549
Really?

607
00:37:36,089 --> 00:37:37,719
I think he's going to become a huge hit.

608
00:37:43,330 --> 00:37:44,460
I'm leaving first.

609
00:37:44,830 --> 00:37:46,330
- Bye. - Bye.

610
00:37:46,500 --> 00:37:47,900
- Have a good night. - Bye.

611
00:37:48,130 --> 00:37:49,170
Bye.

612
00:37:56,810 --> 00:37:57,839
Ms. Nam.

613
00:37:59,580 --> 00:38:01,449
You don't have a lecture tomorrow morning, do you?

614
00:38:02,380 --> 00:38:03,449
No.

615
00:38:04,750 --> 00:38:06,250
Let's go out and have a drink.

616
00:38:06,819 --> 00:38:07,850
It's on me.

617
00:38:08,589 --> 00:38:09,619
Gosh.

618
00:38:10,290 --> 00:38:11,759
I'm sorry, but let's drink some other time.

619
00:38:11,989 --> 00:38:13,830
I'm not feeling too great today.

620
00:38:14,290 --> 00:38:16,130
Oh, okay.

621
00:38:19,730 --> 00:38:21,600
So, did you perhaps speak with...

622
00:38:24,699 --> 00:38:25,770
Sorry.

623
00:38:29,810 --> 00:38:30,839
Hey, Mom.

624
00:38:36,650 --> 00:38:37,779
I miss my son.

625
00:38:38,179 --> 00:38:40,420
My gosh. I can't believe you.

626
00:38:40,790 --> 00:38:42,489
Could there be a greater one-sided love than this?

627
00:38:43,159 --> 00:38:46,259
I mean, if I think about it, he seems so harsh.

628
00:38:46,429 --> 00:38:47,659
But when I see him, he's just so adorable.

629
00:38:48,089 --> 00:38:49,130
Right.

630
00:38:50,330 --> 00:38:53,000
Haven't you ever been upset because of Seoung Gyu?

631
00:38:56,130 --> 00:38:57,600
Rather than feeling upset,

632
00:38:58,239 --> 00:38:59,699
I thought I was going to die of frustration.

633
00:39:00,569 --> 00:39:02,169
Was it because of my Jun Ho?

634
00:39:02,170 --> 00:39:03,210
Yes.

635
00:39:04,480 --> 00:39:07,249
Well, the friend who barely dodged...

636
00:39:07,250 --> 00:39:08,849
coming in last place on the first exams...

637
00:39:08,850 --> 00:39:11,079
was beating him and rising up the ranks.

638
00:39:11,080 --> 00:39:12,750
But he was just smiling and laughing.

639
00:39:13,589 --> 00:39:14,650
My goodness.

640
00:39:16,150 --> 00:39:17,920
I mean, even when Jun Ho...

641
00:39:18,389 --> 00:39:20,360
overtook him in rank, he just laughed.

642
00:39:20,730 --> 00:39:22,759
And when Jun Ho got into a better university, he just laughed.

643
00:39:23,060 --> 00:39:25,529
When Jun Ho got into a top company, he just laughed.

644
00:39:25,960 --> 00:39:29,069
Gosh, every time that happened, I yelled at him so much.

645
00:39:31,139 --> 00:39:32,239
My goodness.

646
00:39:33,469 --> 00:39:34,509
Gosh.

647
00:39:34,810 --> 00:39:38,039
Back when Jun Ho did that, I felt like the whole world was mine.

648
00:39:38,040 --> 00:39:39,639
Goodness, gracious.

649
00:39:42,409 --> 00:39:45,480
When Jun Ho said he was going to join the academy,

650
00:39:46,380 --> 00:39:48,989
I actually felt a little satisfied.

651
00:39:49,589 --> 00:39:52,119
I thought, "Goodness, he must finally be facing..."

652
00:39:52,290 --> 00:39:53,730
"something bad."

653
00:39:53,790 --> 00:39:56,029
Gosh, that was too mean.

654
00:39:59,429 --> 00:40:01,830
But not anymore.

655
00:40:03,569 --> 00:40:07,540
I think I might call him the director of the academy...

656
00:40:08,770 --> 00:40:11,739
one day, so I'm supporting him all the way.

657
00:40:13,409 --> 00:40:15,380
You used to say it would be Seo Hye Jin.

658
00:40:16,779 --> 00:40:18,219
That one is now...

659
00:40:20,119 --> 00:40:21,350
on her way downhill.

660
00:40:21,719 --> 00:40:22,750
Hey.

661
00:40:23,489 --> 00:40:27,359
You guys are standing in a crowded market in the Qing Dynasty...

662
00:40:27,360 --> 00:40:28,830
in the late 18th century.

663
00:40:29,029 --> 00:40:30,699
Keep that in mind as you read the question.

664
00:40:31,159 --> 00:40:33,899
Considering the context, what is the most appropriate...

665
00:40:33,900 --> 00:40:35,169
as the meaning of part G?

666
00:40:35,170 --> 00:40:36,199
Find part G.

667
00:40:36,469 --> 00:40:37,940
"The seeds of an immense cri..."

668
00:40:42,139 --> 00:40:43,940
"The seeds of an immense crisis were being sown."

669
00:40:46,040 --> 00:40:48,509
All right. "Seeds of a crisis." It's explaining it right above.

670
00:40:48,810 --> 00:40:49,810
In cases like this, kids,

671
00:40:49,811 --> 00:40:51,719
you have to come up with the answer before you look at the choices.

672
00:40:51,880 --> 00:40:53,349
Take a look. What is it?

673
00:40:53,350 --> 00:40:54,750
"The risk of a rebellion..."

674
00:40:59,389 --> 00:41:00,389
Sorry.

675
00:41:07,600 --> 00:41:08,670
Hey, Mom.

676
00:41:09,799 --> 00:41:10,940
I'm on my way.

677
00:41:12,170 --> 00:41:13,739
I know. Your son is better than your husband.

678
00:41:14,139 --> 00:41:15,170
I'll be there soon.

679
00:41:30,589 --> 00:41:32,419
My mother had a few drinks,

680
00:41:32,420 --> 00:41:34,060
and she misses her second son like crazy.

681
00:41:34,889 --> 00:41:36,929
I'll take her home, then come to the academy.

682
00:41:42,770 --> 00:41:44,099
Min Ji, you can go ahead.

683
00:41:44,100 --> 00:41:45,670
- Good job today. - Thanks.

684
00:41:46,500 --> 00:41:48,239
Oh, did you say...

685
00:41:48,969 --> 00:41:51,310
you might go back to school in March?

686
00:41:51,509 --> 00:41:53,610
Oh, I haven't decided yet.

687
00:41:53,880 --> 00:41:55,310
You have to hire someone, don't you?

688
00:41:55,409 --> 00:41:57,080
When do I need to tell you by?

689
00:41:58,850 --> 00:42:01,589
You can take your time. It's not urgent.

690
00:42:02,690 --> 00:42:03,719
Okay.

691
00:42:10,730 --> 00:42:12,698
Drink with her if she wants...

692
00:42:12,699 --> 00:42:13,969
and take her home safely.

693
00:42:14,569 --> 00:42:15,730
Thanks for the drinks.

694
00:42:18,699 --> 00:42:20,139
Oh, my gosh.

695
00:42:21,069 --> 00:42:23,069
You startled me. What was that?

696
00:42:23,509 --> 00:42:25,880
I'm just your mom's friend's son.

697
00:42:27,679 --> 00:42:28,980
Our moms are just...

698
00:42:29,350 --> 00:42:32,719
I was disappointed that Ms. Nam had gotten off work early.

699
00:42:33,389 --> 00:42:35,119
I guess it all worked out.

700
00:42:35,790 --> 00:42:36,989
Let's have some makgeolli.

701
00:42:37,420 --> 00:42:38,489
Hey.

702
00:42:39,690 --> 00:42:42,429
Did Ms. Nam say anything else?

703
00:42:43,429 --> 00:42:44,799
What should I have heard?

704
00:42:45,429 --> 00:42:47,130
Never mind. Let's go inside.

705
00:42:48,730 --> 00:42:49,900
What's going on?

706
00:42:50,739 --> 00:42:51,799
Hey.

707
00:43:31,639 --> 00:43:34,279
I'm having dinner with Mr. Yoon Ji Seok.

708
00:43:35,250 --> 00:43:38,319
I thought he might need some encouragement.

709
00:43:56,270 --> 00:43:57,569
You may enter.

710
00:44:02,110 --> 00:44:03,170
Mr. Yoon.

711
00:44:06,380 --> 00:44:07,980
I saw your car was parked.

712
00:44:09,250 --> 00:44:10,619
I came up just in case.

713
00:44:11,279 --> 00:44:12,319
I see.

714
00:44:37,480 --> 00:44:39,380
Are you making a new textbook?

715
00:44:39,779 --> 00:44:40,779
Yes.

716
00:44:41,049 --> 00:44:44,249
The one I use for the KSAT lecture is old.

717
00:44:44,250 --> 00:44:45,250
Is it?

718
00:44:45,420 --> 00:44:47,350
You printed a new batch before the school break.

719
00:44:48,889 --> 00:44:50,560
- I... - I remember all sorts, don't I?

720
00:44:52,989 --> 00:44:53,989
You do.

721
00:44:58,460 --> 00:44:59,460
- Jun Ho... - Can I...

722
00:45:04,339 --> 00:45:05,670
Where's Jun Ho? Why are you alone?

723
00:45:06,540 --> 00:45:09,210
Isn't this place scary if you're alone at night?

724
00:45:09,810 --> 00:45:12,880
I'm used to staying late on my own. It's fine.

725
00:45:13,779 --> 00:45:14,880
Jun Ho...

726
00:45:17,880 --> 00:45:19,480
Ms. Woo told you, didn't she?

727
00:45:20,589 --> 00:45:21,589
Yes.

728
00:45:25,060 --> 00:45:26,159
I was so surprised.

729
00:45:28,259 --> 00:45:31,330
At first, I was surprised to hear her say she would leave.

730
00:45:33,029 --> 00:45:35,330
But when she told me about you and Jun Ho,

731
00:45:36,199 --> 00:45:38,199
I think I was ten thousand times more surprised.

732
00:45:39,869 --> 00:45:41,469
It's a miracle I didn't faint.

733
00:45:54,690 --> 00:45:55,750
It must be true, then.

734
00:46:00,560 --> 00:46:02,589
Ms. Woo disliked you a lot.

735
00:46:03,730 --> 00:46:06,259
I wanted to check with you in case she'd made it up.

736
00:46:09,270 --> 00:46:11,639
I'd like you to accept it without prejudice.

737
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:14,040
What prejudice?

738
00:46:14,540 --> 00:46:17,238
Jun Ho's face getting put on our posters as soon as he joined,

739
00:46:17,239 --> 00:46:18,779
his joint lecture with me,

740
00:46:19,279 --> 00:46:21,080
and his new class that just started.

741
00:46:21,279 --> 00:46:23,580
That had nothing to do with our relationship.

742
00:46:27,549 --> 00:46:28,889
You're still so calm.

743
00:46:29,020 --> 00:46:31,420
I believe you understand my position.

744
00:46:31,860 --> 00:46:35,290
You and I have worked here since the place opened.

745
00:46:35,489 --> 00:46:36,888
If you were in my shoes, you'd...

746
00:46:36,889 --> 00:46:38,000
You're so eloquent.

747
00:46:39,759 --> 00:46:41,369
I think so all the time, but you are.

748
00:46:43,369 --> 00:46:44,440
You almost had me.

749
00:46:45,839 --> 00:46:48,509
I almost thought instructors cared about their academies.

750
00:46:48,670 --> 00:46:50,610
- Mr. Yoon. - That's why I always went with it.

751
00:46:52,839 --> 00:46:54,350
When you didn't want to hire Jun Ho.

752
00:46:55,610 --> 00:46:56,679
When you said you'd hired him.

753
00:46:58,420 --> 00:47:00,080
When you said you'd tutored him in secret.

754
00:47:02,350 --> 00:47:04,319
And when you considered moving to Choisun Academy.

755
00:47:10,900 --> 00:47:12,799
Is this too cowardly?

756
00:47:16,600 --> 00:47:18,239
It wasn't because you were eloquent.

757
00:47:28,880 --> 00:47:30,420
It was because I had other intentions.

758
00:47:33,989 --> 00:47:34,989
That's...

759
00:47:35,589 --> 00:47:37,589
I can't be responsible for that.

760
00:47:37,759 --> 00:47:40,019
You never talked to me about that or...

761
00:47:40,020 --> 00:47:41,360
But you knew.

762
00:47:41,860 --> 00:47:43,360
I was always around.

763
00:47:48,100 --> 00:47:49,469
You could've tipped me off.

764
00:47:51,170 --> 00:47:53,040
Then I wouldn't have made a fool of myself.

765
00:47:54,569 --> 00:47:55,868
I never once thought...

766
00:47:55,869 --> 00:47:58,310
you were making a fool of yourself.

767
00:48:00,350 --> 00:48:01,508
I'm grateful you sided with me...

768
00:48:01,509 --> 00:48:04,949
whenever I was in trouble or clashed with someone.

769
00:48:06,020 --> 00:48:07,089
But...

770
00:48:07,920 --> 00:48:10,319
I don't know what she said and how she said it,

771
00:48:10,489 --> 00:48:13,658
but I'm not the one who's trying to...

772
00:48:13,659 --> 00:48:15,290
use your feelings. It's Ms. Woo.

773
00:48:15,690 --> 00:48:17,159
- Playing us against... - I know.

774
00:48:19,400 --> 00:48:20,429
I'm not stupid.

775
00:48:26,339 --> 00:48:27,739
Can I get a coffee?

776
00:49:07,679 --> 00:49:09,009
I was such a fool.

777
00:49:27,569 --> 00:49:28,629
Eat this.

778
00:49:28,630 --> 00:49:31,540
Because of those darn hot flashes,

779
00:49:31,770 --> 00:49:33,909
I need an electric fan even in this weather.

780
00:49:34,069 --> 00:49:36,868
You need to take cinnamon for that.

781
00:49:36,869 --> 00:49:38,379
Cinnamon's the best.

782
00:49:38,380 --> 00:49:40,448
Do you know how much sujeonggwa I drink?

783
00:49:40,449 --> 00:49:42,609
It's not the same as that.

784
00:49:42,610 --> 00:49:43,879
- Let's just eat. - Gosh.

785
00:49:43,880 --> 00:49:45,749
- It can't be helped. - Oh, dear.

786
00:49:45,750 --> 00:49:47,548
- It's menopause. - You need cinnamon.

787
00:49:47,549 --> 00:49:50,088
- Seriously. - Sujeonggwa has cinnamon.

788
00:49:50,089 --> 00:49:52,019
It's not the same as taking pure cinnamon.

789
00:49:52,020 --> 00:49:54,158
- Not like that. - Mom, your phone's ringing.

790
00:49:54,159 --> 00:49:55,159
It'll be your dad.

791
00:49:56,790 --> 00:50:00,060
- It was scientifically proven... - Shouldn't you take it, then?

792
00:50:06,100 --> 00:50:07,909
I'm not going to whine...

793
00:50:08,940 --> 00:50:09,940
that I liked you too.

794
00:50:11,880 --> 00:50:15,009
But then I can't stay around you and Jun Ho forever.

795
00:50:17,150 --> 00:50:19,420
Even if Ms. Woo's just using how I feel,

796
00:50:21,389 --> 00:50:23,619
that feels better than knowing you two deceived me.

797
00:50:25,589 --> 00:50:27,528
If you'd told me how you'd felt,

798
00:50:27,529 --> 00:50:28,960
I'd have acted differently.

799
00:50:29,730 --> 00:50:30,730
You're blaming me?

800
00:50:31,699 --> 00:50:33,529
I didn't deceive you.

801
00:50:37,639 --> 00:50:39,739
This is the first time you've looked at me for this long.

802
00:50:40,069 --> 00:50:41,810
What was I to say and how?

803
00:50:47,679 --> 00:50:49,210
I would like to know one thing.

804
00:50:51,480 --> 00:50:53,179
What if I asked you out before Jun Ho joined?

805
00:50:55,089 --> 00:50:56,150
Would I have had a shot?

806
00:51:00,830 --> 00:51:01,860
No.

807
00:51:04,630 --> 00:51:05,659
Right?

808
00:51:08,900 --> 00:51:10,540
That's the good thing about unrequited love.

809
00:51:12,069 --> 00:51:13,400
It's a bit cowardly,

810
00:51:14,210 --> 00:51:16,239
but you can hang around safely and in comfort.

811
00:51:19,339 --> 00:51:20,409
It was nice while it lasted.

812
00:51:22,279 --> 00:51:24,480
Coming into work and sharing a coffee.

813
00:51:25,179 --> 00:51:26,250
Discussing the weather.

814
00:51:27,179 --> 00:51:28,650
Talking about the students.

815
00:51:31,619 --> 00:51:32,619
I enjoyed it.

816
00:51:33,759 --> 00:51:35,859
Choi Hyung Sun will take over the academy...

817
00:51:35,860 --> 00:51:37,600
that Ms. Woo's trying to start.

818
00:51:37,759 --> 00:51:39,060
She'll offer a better package...

819
00:51:39,330 --> 00:51:41,469
- to recruit you all only to... - Don't worry about them.

820
00:51:43,130 --> 00:51:44,299
They're all adults.

821
00:51:44,969 --> 00:51:46,170
They'll make up their minds.

822
00:51:47,509 --> 00:51:48,569
"They?"

823
00:51:49,969 --> 00:51:51,279
By "they," you mean...

824
00:51:51,739 --> 00:51:54,250
There's a group chat with us all minus you and Jun Ho.

825
00:51:55,710 --> 00:51:56,880
We're meeting up before class tomorrow.

826
00:51:59,380 --> 00:52:01,818
This is exactly what Ms. Woo wants.

827
00:52:01,819 --> 00:52:02,889
Yes.

828
00:52:04,159 --> 00:52:05,219
As I said, I know.

829
00:52:08,630 --> 00:52:09,659
(Traditional Food and Drink)

830
00:52:09,730 --> 00:52:11,499
- Gosh. - I enjoyed the food.

831
00:52:11,500 --> 00:52:15,468
- Son. - Who keeps texting me?

832
00:52:15,469 --> 00:52:17,839
- What is it? - Woo Seung Hui...

833
00:52:20,170 --> 00:52:21,540
- What is it? - Don't.

834
00:52:24,810 --> 00:52:25,839
Gosh.

835
00:52:28,279 --> 00:52:29,480
Jun Ho.

836
00:52:32,049 --> 00:52:33,679
What's going on?

837
00:52:33,920 --> 00:52:34,949
It's nothing.

838
00:52:36,549 --> 00:52:39,520
Ms. Kim. Could I have a look?

839
00:52:40,860 --> 00:52:42,988
- No. - It's fine.

840
00:52:42,989 --> 00:52:44,960
(My Hometown)

841
00:52:55,610 --> 00:52:57,210
Mom, I'm seeing someone.

842
00:52:58,409 --> 00:52:59,480
Hey, you...

843
00:53:01,150 --> 00:53:03,009
Why would you say something like that...

844
00:53:03,310 --> 00:53:05,549
when we're standing in a street?

845
00:53:12,719 --> 00:53:14,060
We're serious.

846
00:53:14,730 --> 00:53:16,588
I know you're seeing someone.

847
00:53:16,589 --> 00:53:19,199
- When I visited last time... - It's my ex-tutor Seo Hye Jin.

848
00:53:24,270 --> 00:53:25,299
Seoung Gyu.

849
00:53:26,239 --> 00:53:27,869
What's he talking about?

850
00:53:27,969 --> 00:53:30,068
(Daechi-dong Park)

851
00:53:30,069 --> 00:53:31,409
I request an open discussion...

852
00:53:31,810 --> 00:53:34,380
on Lee Jun Ho's class on appreciating literature.

853
00:53:35,949 --> 00:53:39,179
I heard this class was only possible because of...

854
00:53:39,449 --> 00:53:40,888
Lee's personal and special relationship...

855
00:53:40,889 --> 00:53:42,489
with Seo Hye Jin.

856
00:53:43,319 --> 00:53:45,389
It's not a groundless rumor made up to slander them.

857
00:53:48,089 --> 00:53:49,190
Seo Hye Jin...

858
00:53:49,429 --> 00:53:52,028
used her position as team leader and main instructor.

859
00:53:52,029 --> 00:53:53,029
What the...

860
00:53:53,030 --> 00:53:54,968
She favored her lover Lee Jun Ho...

861
00:53:54,969 --> 00:53:56,999
- What? - and gave him extra resources.

862
00:53:57,000 --> 00:53:58,000
What does this mean?

863
00:53:58,569 --> 00:54:00,139
I think we should discuss...

864
00:54:00,639 --> 00:54:03,969
not just this class but all that happened since Lee joined.

865
00:54:06,080 --> 00:54:07,179
I'd like to ask...

866
00:54:08,009 --> 00:54:09,810
what you instructors think of this.

867
00:54:12,279 --> 00:54:13,850
(Kim Chae Yun)

868
00:54:14,790 --> 00:54:17,758
Ms. Seo. I just got a weird message.

869
00:54:17,759 --> 00:54:18,790
Is it true?

870
00:54:18,960 --> 00:54:20,929
Are you dating Mr. Lee Jun Ho?

871
00:54:21,489 --> 00:54:23,860
Is this a joke that I got left out of?

872
00:54:45,650 --> 00:54:46,679
I'll go home now.

873
00:54:46,980 --> 00:54:48,549
Drink some honey water and sleep well.

874
00:54:50,219 --> 00:54:51,318
The door is open.

875
00:54:51,319 --> 00:54:52,319
Stay the night.

876
00:54:53,020 --> 00:54:54,060
I have to go.

877
00:54:55,560 --> 00:54:56,659
I'm worried about Ms. Seo.

878
00:54:57,060 --> 00:54:59,658
What am I to do about you?

879
00:54:59,659 --> 00:55:02,698
I'm so upset. I don't know what to do.

880
00:55:02,699 --> 00:55:05,239
What is the matter with you?

881
00:55:05,339 --> 00:55:07,068
What are you doing?

882
00:55:07,069 --> 00:55:08,810
What is wrong?

883
00:55:09,170 --> 00:55:12,440
I'm so upset. Why are you doing this?

884
00:55:13,710 --> 00:55:14,850
Goodness...

885
00:56:20,040 --> 00:56:21,080
Ms. Seo.

886
00:56:22,409 --> 00:56:23,449
Let's go.

887
00:56:25,719 --> 00:56:27,119
I'm too scared to be here.

888
00:56:28,949 --> 00:56:31,259
Why? Did something happen tonight?

889
00:56:33,060 --> 00:56:34,690
Yoon Ji Seok was here.

890
00:56:35,429 --> 00:56:36,460
He's going to...

891
00:56:37,429 --> 00:56:38,730
tell everyone about us.

892
00:56:43,270 --> 00:56:44,940
I must've lived a crappy life.

893
00:56:45,770 --> 00:56:47,100
No one's on our side.

894
00:56:48,639 --> 00:56:50,409
I read the text Mr. Yoon sent out.

895
00:56:51,739 --> 00:56:53,679
We can explain everything.

896
00:56:54,650 --> 00:56:56,350
They'll understand like Ms. Nam did.

897
00:56:59,719 --> 00:57:00,750
Let's go.

898
00:57:08,960 --> 00:57:11,759
What's the occasion? How come you called me?

899
00:57:14,770 --> 00:57:17,639
I had makgeolli, and so I can't take you home.

900
00:57:18,799 --> 00:57:20,770
That's not why I asked to see you.

901
00:57:24,069 --> 00:57:25,080
Here.

902
00:57:30,509 --> 00:57:33,850
I live with someone who works at your academy.

903
00:57:35,219 --> 00:57:36,350
I got a gist of it.

904
00:57:37,520 --> 00:57:39,860
I brought this because I thought we'd be here a while.

905
00:57:41,860 --> 00:57:42,860
Thanks.

906
00:57:59,839 --> 00:58:01,350
I'm standing at a fork in the road.

907
00:58:03,009 --> 00:58:05,380
Should I choose ambition or loyalty?

908
00:58:08,619 --> 00:58:10,619
I like how loaded the theme is,

909
00:58:11,690 --> 00:58:13,190
but is this issue...

910
00:58:14,489 --> 00:58:15,560
that serious?

911
00:58:16,429 --> 00:58:17,659
Enough to threaten the academy?

912
00:58:19,900 --> 00:58:21,630
It's not and shouldn't be,

913
00:58:22,130 --> 00:58:24,469
but it looks like it will, and that's why it's bad.

914
00:58:25,699 --> 00:58:26,739
What?

915
00:58:28,210 --> 00:58:31,339
By this time tomorrow, everyone in this neighborhood...

916
00:58:32,080 --> 00:58:34,040
will think Ms. Seo is crazy.

917
00:58:35,850 --> 00:58:37,610
Gosh. Is it that bad?

918
00:58:38,219 --> 00:58:39,448
Those people think...

919
00:58:39,449 --> 00:58:41,989
the relationship is a huge weakness they can exploit.

920
00:58:42,790 --> 00:58:44,989
How disgustingly well would they use it?

921
00:58:47,020 --> 00:58:48,658
They don't even have to ask...

922
00:58:48,659 --> 00:58:51,460
people from other academies to spread the rumor like wildfire.

923
00:58:52,400 --> 00:58:54,999
They'll wait to poach Ms. Seo's students...

924
00:58:55,000 --> 00:58:57,170
once they start to leave.

925
00:59:00,199 --> 00:59:03,638
It's like a massive chunk of meat landed...

926
00:59:03,639 --> 00:59:05,739
in the middle of a pack of hyenas.

927
00:59:09,480 --> 00:59:10,509
And...

928
00:59:12,880 --> 00:59:15,949
I'm in the position to get a cut before anyone else.

929
00:59:19,719 --> 00:59:20,759
Then...

930
00:59:22,330 --> 00:59:23,360
you must eat.

931
00:59:25,400 --> 00:59:27,130
- Right? - Yes.

932
00:59:28,130 --> 00:59:30,199
You moved here on your own...

933
00:59:30,369 --> 00:59:32,139
to work like crazy to succeed.

934
00:59:33,569 --> 00:59:35,009
What good is loyalty?

935
00:59:39,739 --> 00:59:40,739
Are you being sarcastic?

936
00:59:41,810 --> 00:59:43,009
Not at all.

937
00:59:44,920 --> 00:59:46,650
Did you get what I meant?

938
00:59:49,690 --> 00:59:52,060
I have to take a huge bite out of your friend...

939
00:59:52,389 --> 00:59:55,758
and the person who got you into university.

940
00:59:55,759 --> 00:59:58,000
As if it would show if you didn't.

941
00:59:58,699 --> 01:00:00,258
You said everyone else...

942
01:00:00,259 --> 01:00:02,599
will rush in, bite, chew,

943
01:00:02,600 --> 01:00:03,630
and taste them.

944
01:00:11,639 --> 01:00:14,580
I take back asking Jun Ho to treat us to an expensive meal.

945
01:00:16,909 --> 01:00:20,250
It looks like you might have to pay for a while.

946
01:00:24,089 --> 01:00:25,659
Oh, gosh...

947
01:00:29,929 --> 01:00:32,830
If I buy you expensive meals with the money I made doing that,

948
01:00:33,060 --> 01:00:34,500
will you eat it?

949
01:00:37,799 --> 01:00:39,799
I'll think about that.

950
01:00:41,839 --> 01:00:43,210
It might make me ill.

951
01:00:53,850 --> 01:00:55,049
What's going on?

952
01:00:55,790 --> 01:00:57,420
It's almost midnight.

953
01:00:57,589 --> 01:00:58,619
Ms. Woo.

954
01:01:00,219 --> 01:01:01,929
Did you get Mr. Yoon's text?

955
01:01:05,000 --> 01:01:07,330
Were you aware the two were dating?

956
01:01:11,400 --> 01:01:14,369
Why didn't you discuss it with me first?

957
01:01:17,369 --> 01:01:18,380
Discuss it with you?

958
01:01:19,080 --> 01:01:20,139
I mean...

959
01:01:20,980 --> 01:01:23,650
If you'd told me about it first,

960
01:01:23,880 --> 01:01:25,548
I could've gathered the others...

961
01:01:25,549 --> 01:01:27,250
and got them on the same page.

962
01:01:28,190 --> 01:01:30,520
You could've considered how this would make me look.

963
01:01:34,589 --> 01:01:35,589
You know,

964
01:01:36,860 --> 01:01:39,829
I'm grateful to you...

965
01:01:39,830 --> 01:01:42,270
for a lot of things, Mr. Lee.

966
01:01:42,770 --> 01:01:44,900
You got me Ms. Seo's teaching material.

967
01:01:46,739 --> 01:01:47,799
But...

968
01:01:49,210 --> 01:01:52,580
shouldn't you be grateful to me for a lot of stuff?

969
01:01:53,179 --> 01:01:54,179
No?

970
01:01:54,710 --> 01:01:57,479
I covered up the fact that you lost a whole class...

971
01:01:57,480 --> 01:01:59,819
to Choisun Academy when they hired a new instructor.

972
01:02:00,580 --> 01:02:03,088
When Director Kim wanted to revise your pay,

973
01:02:03,089 --> 01:02:04,089
I stopped him.

974
01:02:04,690 --> 01:02:06,658
You using your master's degree to...

975
01:02:06,659 --> 01:02:07,929
Ms. Woo.

976
01:02:08,389 --> 01:02:10,429
Everyone knows...

977
01:02:10,690 --> 01:02:13,798
that you work for me.

978
01:02:13,799 --> 01:02:16,099
And everyone knows you always disliked Hye Jin.

979
01:02:16,100 --> 01:02:19,468
If you were to step forward and talk about...

980
01:02:19,469 --> 01:02:21,039
Hye Jin and Jun Ho,

981
01:02:21,040 --> 01:02:23,139
how credible do you think that would be?

982
01:02:27,339 --> 01:02:28,350
Well,

983
01:02:29,080 --> 01:02:31,278
it wouldn't matter who started the rumor...

984
01:02:31,279 --> 01:02:34,219
that starts to spread outside the academy.

985
01:02:39,860 --> 01:02:40,920
I got the hint.

986
01:02:44,730 --> 01:02:48,170
Mentioning how they met when Lee was a minor...

987
01:02:49,569 --> 01:02:50,670
Is that too much?

988
01:02:54,810 --> 01:02:58,810
I think you'd have made a great writer if you hadn't...

989
01:02:59,409 --> 01:03:01,779
decided to teach Korean.

990
01:03:03,949 --> 01:03:05,920
Once the move is done,

991
01:03:07,520 --> 01:03:08,549
Seo Hye Jin's material is mine.

992
01:03:11,360 --> 01:03:12,360
Okay?

993
01:03:25,270 --> 01:03:26,299
Go on home.

994
01:03:30,210 --> 01:03:31,239
What?

995
01:03:33,509 --> 01:03:34,750
What about dinner?

996
01:03:37,949 --> 01:03:39,049
I'll eat at home.

997
01:03:41,080 --> 01:03:42,150
Don't lie.

998
01:03:47,960 --> 01:03:49,060
I want to feed you.

999
01:03:58,699 --> 01:04:01,170
The rice was microwaved, but the side dishes will be good.

1000
01:04:01,610 --> 01:04:02,670
My mom made them.

1001
01:04:14,619 --> 01:04:16,719
It's hard to eat with no soup, isn't it?

1002
01:04:17,850 --> 01:04:20,259
No, it's fine. I'll eat.

1003
01:04:20,360 --> 01:04:21,389
I'll get some warm water.

1004
01:05:47,310 --> 01:05:48,810
It's cold. Get back home.

1005
01:05:50,279 --> 01:05:51,520
Call if you can't sleep.

1006
01:05:52,049 --> 01:05:54,279
Sorry I left without doing the dishes.

1007
01:05:54,480 --> 01:05:55,819
Don't worry about that.

1008
01:06:03,589 --> 01:06:04,659
See you.

1009
01:06:08,330 --> 01:06:09,400
Thanks.

Hey.

1012
01:08:50,530 --> 01:08:51,600
Just a moment.

1013
01:08:52,429 --> 01:08:53,560
Where are you going?

1014
01:08:55,570 --> 01:08:58,200
Did you leave something behind?

1015
01:08:59,669 --> 01:09:00,700
No.

1016
01:09:03,240 --> 01:09:04,240
Then what?

1017
01:09:07,179 --> 01:09:09,709
I forgot to tell you something. What about you?

1018
01:09:13,020 --> 01:09:14,379
I wanted to ask you something.

1019
01:09:14,520 --> 01:09:15,549
I see.

1020
01:09:16,490 --> 01:09:17,520
What is it?

1021
01:09:19,660 --> 01:09:20,719
You go first.

1022
01:09:25,060 --> 01:09:27,360
- Shall we go inside? - No, it's a simple topic.

1023
01:09:30,870 --> 01:09:31,940
I'm...

1024
01:09:33,669 --> 01:09:34,740
okay.

1025
01:09:37,469 --> 01:09:39,179
I wanted to tell you I'm okay.

1026
01:09:40,539 --> 01:09:42,009
Go to sleep and don't worry about me.

1027
01:09:43,850 --> 01:09:45,620
What were you going to ask?

1028
01:09:47,620 --> 01:09:48,650
Oh, well,

1029
01:09:49,520 --> 01:09:50,589
it was nothing.

1030
01:09:51,690 --> 01:09:54,360
I wanted to know if you were okay.

1031
01:09:55,730 --> 01:09:56,789
I see.

1032
01:10:00,429 --> 01:10:02,030
- I'll walk you back... - No, there's one more thing.

1033
01:10:03,370 --> 01:10:04,429
One more thing to say.

1034
01:10:14,579 --> 01:10:16,480
- Is it... - I love you.

1035
01:10:21,719 --> 01:10:22,749
You said...

1036
01:10:23,889 --> 01:10:25,660
I just had to say I love you.
