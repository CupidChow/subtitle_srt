6
00:00:45,564 --> 00:00:47,164
- Hey. - Gosh. Give me that.

7
00:00:47,164 --> 00:00:48,505
(Episode 11)

8
00:00:51,734 --> 00:00:53,734
You should've called me before you came.

9
00:00:53,905 --> 00:00:56,105
If I did, you would've told me you didn't have time for me.

10
00:00:57,615 --> 00:00:59,575
I rarely eat at home.

11
00:00:59,575 --> 00:01:00,645
You didn't have to bring any food.

12
00:01:04,255 --> 00:01:06,685
You did a nice job making the house look cozy.

13
00:01:07,825 --> 00:01:09,085
Gosh. What's this?

14
00:01:14,194 --> 00:01:15,895
I see.

15
00:01:18,794 --> 00:01:19,964
Gosh.

16
00:01:33,444 --> 00:01:35,214
- What? You have a closet in here? - Wait.

17
00:01:35,244 --> 00:01:38,054
- Hold on. Mom. - I see.

18
00:01:38,054 --> 00:01:39,554
Mom. Stop. What was I going to say?

19
00:01:39,884 --> 00:01:40,925
That.

20
00:01:41,524 --> 00:01:43,054
- What do I do with that? - What?

21
00:01:43,884 --> 00:01:46,194
Do I just put the food in the fridge? What do I do?

22
00:01:48,964 --> 00:01:50,365
You don't like fresh kimchi.

23
00:01:50,365 --> 00:01:52,434
Keep the young radish kimchi outside for two days and then eat it.

24
00:01:52,535 --> 00:01:53,535
Okay.

25
00:01:53,535 --> 00:01:54,634
I marinated the meat for you...

26
00:01:54,634 --> 00:01:56,404
and packed diced vegetables into small portions.

27
00:01:56,404 --> 00:01:57,774
So keep them in the freezer.

28
00:02:00,404 --> 00:02:01,944
I'll take care of them later.

29
00:02:13,154 --> 00:02:14,684
Gosh. Give me that.

30
00:02:14,684 --> 00:02:16,054
You should've told me to come by to pick them up.

31
00:02:16,485 --> 00:02:18,024
Why did you come all the way here? It's a hassle for you.

32
00:02:18,024 --> 00:02:19,094
This is quite rewarding.

33
00:02:20,895 --> 00:02:23,524
- I'll do it. - I got it. Gosh.

34
00:02:23,925 --> 00:02:25,695
When I bring a bagful of food to your brother,

35
00:02:25,695 --> 00:02:27,904
he never thanks me for my hard work. Not even a word.

36
00:02:28,564 --> 00:02:29,665
I coddled him too much...

37
00:02:29,665 --> 00:02:31,705
for being the eldest child. So he's so spoiled now.

38
00:02:35,175 --> 00:02:36,874
- Mom, here. - Okay.

39
00:02:38,814 --> 00:02:40,415
Wait. Let me do it.

40
00:02:40,415 --> 00:02:41,415
Okay.

41
00:02:56,265 --> 00:02:57,695
Hang in there a little longer. I'm really sorry.

42
00:02:58,865 --> 00:02:59,865
Hang in there.

43
00:03:01,735 --> 00:03:02,804
Gosh.

44
00:03:03,964 --> 00:03:07,874
Goodness. How come you only have beer and water in the fridge?

45
00:03:08,605 --> 00:03:10,145
- Mom, here. - Leave it there. Get me that.

46
00:03:10,974 --> 00:03:12,045
My goodness.

47
00:03:16,244 --> 00:03:17,814
So did you have breakfast?

48
00:03:17,915 --> 00:03:19,254
This is so upsetting.

49
00:03:20,654 --> 00:03:23,325
Other people think about what to have for lunch now.

50
00:03:23,325 --> 00:03:24,554
Do you like waking up this late?

51
00:03:27,295 --> 00:03:29,795
- Let's go out. I'll buy you lunch. - Goodness. Wait.

52
00:03:30,425 --> 00:03:31,895
Gosh, Mom. Let's go out.

53
00:03:33,265 --> 00:03:35,265
It hasn't been ten minutes since I got here.

54
00:03:35,605 --> 00:03:37,534
I just can't wait to buy you a delicious lunch.

55
00:03:37,904 --> 00:03:39,774
- Let's go. - Stop it. Where's the bathroom?

56
00:03:40,135 --> 00:03:41,145
Why?

57
00:03:42,374 --> 00:03:43,874
Why are you acting odd?

58
00:03:44,515 --> 00:03:45,774
Why would one want to go to the bathroom?

59
00:03:47,474 --> 00:03:48,515
Right.

60
00:03:49,885 --> 00:03:50,885
It's over there.

61
00:03:54,184 --> 00:03:55,184
There.

62
00:04:01,464 --> 00:04:03,494
Be careful. Let me turn on the light.

63
00:04:06,534 --> 00:04:08,534
Mom. Take your time. There's no rush.

64
00:04:25,654 --> 00:04:27,055
- It's okay. I'll just go. - Wait.

65
00:05:39,555 --> 00:05:41,224
Look at that. Gosh.

66
00:05:56,205 --> 00:05:57,604
Why were you guarding the door?

67
00:05:58,375 --> 00:06:00,914
I have a big house here. I didn't want you to get lost.

68
00:06:01,044 --> 00:06:02,185
Is that supposed to be a joke?

69
00:06:08,585 --> 00:06:10,224
I don't have anything to drink in the house.

70
00:06:10,385 --> 00:06:11,524
Should I go and buy you some juice?

71
00:06:11,524 --> 00:06:13,224
I don't need that. Take a seat.

72
00:06:13,224 --> 00:06:14,625
I came because I needed to talk to you. Sit down.

73
00:06:25,705 --> 00:06:26,875
Your dad and I did some studying...

74
00:06:27,234 --> 00:06:29,104
about top instructors, something we never thought...

75
00:06:29,104 --> 00:06:30,344
we would need to do.

76
00:06:31,214 --> 00:06:32,414
Just wait a little.

77
00:06:32,414 --> 00:06:34,844
I'll make everyone in Korea know my name.

78
00:06:35,114 --> 00:06:36,885
- When is that going to happen? - Pretty soon.

79
00:06:37,344 --> 00:06:39,114
You know what? I want you to meet someone.

80
00:06:40,414 --> 00:06:42,484
You've heard of Plan A Study, right?

81
00:06:43,284 --> 00:06:45,794
Yes. It's the biggest platform for online lectures in Korea.

82
00:06:46,755 --> 00:06:48,424
When your dad worked at a stock firm,

83
00:06:48,424 --> 00:06:49,794
he had a junior colleague. And his son...

84
00:06:49,794 --> 00:06:51,464
Which means he's a stranger to me.

85
00:06:52,635 --> 00:06:53,995
His son...

86
00:06:54,265 --> 00:06:57,205
works in a team that recruits instructors for the lectures.

87
00:06:57,635 --> 00:06:59,174
So your dad mentioned you.

88
00:06:59,974 --> 00:07:01,474
He told your dad to send him...

89
00:07:01,474 --> 00:07:04,205
your resume and a video of your lecture if you had any.

90
00:07:05,875 --> 00:07:08,214
Wait. If you want to be a top instructor in this field,

91
00:07:08,214 --> 00:07:09,544
you must help students prepare...

92
00:07:09,544 --> 00:07:11,085
for the university entrance exam at a big company.

93
00:07:11,284 --> 00:07:12,955
What's the name of the lecture high school seniors...

94
00:07:12,955 --> 00:07:14,755
and the entrance exam repeaters take?

95
00:07:15,354 --> 00:07:16,585
Yes, you should hold online lectures too.

96
00:07:18,195 --> 00:07:19,224
Go on.

97
00:07:19,825 --> 00:07:21,724
Well, as for big companies like that,

98
00:07:22,495 --> 00:07:24,664
referrals and introductions play a big role.

99
00:07:24,835 --> 00:07:26,565
Apparently, you get jobs at places like that through connections.

100
00:07:28,065 --> 00:07:29,734
So Dad will be my connection to those jobs?

101
00:07:30,364 --> 00:07:32,274
He must have looked into it for you.

102
00:07:34,505 --> 00:07:35,505
No, thank you.

103
00:07:37,005 --> 00:07:39,015
I have a good reputation going at my current academy.

104
00:07:39,315 --> 00:07:40,414
The last day to sign up to my lecture...

105
00:07:40,414 --> 00:07:41,445
during the school break is nearing too.

106
00:07:41,445 --> 00:07:42,614
But it's a small academy.

107
00:07:43,044 --> 00:07:44,585
I heard that top-rated instructors...

108
00:07:44,585 --> 00:07:46,414
have dozens or hundreds of students in their class.

109
00:07:46,585 --> 00:07:47,955
It'll take forever to become...

110
00:07:47,955 --> 00:07:49,625
famous and successful when you work at a small academy.

111
00:07:49,625 --> 00:07:52,125
Listen. Many of these famous top-rated instructors...

112
00:07:52,125 --> 00:07:54,864
started their careers by teaching 5 to 6 students at an academy.

113
00:07:55,364 --> 00:07:57,364
I'll gain popularity here and join a bigger academy.

114
00:07:57,364 --> 00:07:58,935
Gosh. Don't talk back to me.

115
00:07:59,065 --> 00:08:01,404
I got his email address. Send him your resume and the video.

116
00:08:02,135 --> 00:08:04,205
Hold on. Where's my phone? Yes, there.

117
00:08:14,515 --> 00:08:15,714
(Ms. Seo)

118
00:08:15,714 --> 00:08:17,344
My mom will leave soon.

119
00:08:17,614 --> 00:08:18,714
Wait a little longer.

120
00:08:28,724 --> 00:08:30,294
I thought I had given birth...

121
00:08:30,294 --> 00:08:32,765
to a boy who was too handsome for his own good.

122
00:08:33,234 --> 00:08:35,034
But good looks helped, I guess. You know?

123
00:08:35,964 --> 00:08:38,075
Hey, he said you could do well.

124
00:08:39,305 --> 00:08:41,305
Gosh. Can you look for the email address?

125
00:08:45,775 --> 00:08:49,344
This means that your dad is coming around. You know?

126
00:08:52,754 --> 00:08:53,854
Gosh.

127
00:08:54,315 --> 00:08:55,955
You know he's a proud man.

128
00:08:55,955 --> 00:08:58,425
He couldn't say that he would let you have your way.

129
00:08:58,754 --> 00:09:00,594
So instead, he found a good lead for your career.

130
00:09:03,624 --> 00:09:05,464
Your dad is getting old too.

131
00:09:09,835 --> 00:09:12,205
Why aren't you saying anything? Are you touched?

132
00:09:14,775 --> 00:09:15,844
I'm thinking.

133
00:09:16,275 --> 00:09:18,815
Gosh. What's there to think about?

134
00:09:20,214 --> 00:09:21,714
Tell him not to set up any meetings.

135
00:09:22,484 --> 00:09:23,644
I won't prepare for it.

136
00:09:24,185 --> 00:09:26,285
Fine. You have pride, don't you?

137
00:09:26,484 --> 00:09:28,455
I knew you would feel awkward about this.

138
00:09:28,555 --> 00:09:29,984
It's not about that.

139
00:09:31,124 --> 00:09:33,155
Turning it down isn't polite either.

140
00:09:33,425 --> 00:09:35,964
Your dad asked for a favor. You'll make him look like a fool.

141
00:09:35,994 --> 00:09:37,165
What if I were to go to the meeting?

142
00:09:37,894 --> 00:09:40,065
How would that make Dad look? You know?

143
00:09:41,935 --> 00:09:43,565
I'll be 30 soon.

144
00:09:43,805 --> 00:09:46,175
If I were to go to a job interview, set up by my dad,

145
00:09:47,335 --> 00:09:48,805
would that help him save face?

146
00:09:51,045 --> 00:09:54,114
Gosh. Why are you talking like that? You're scaring me.

147
00:09:54,644 --> 00:09:56,045
That wasn't your dad's intention.

148
00:09:56,045 --> 00:09:58,315
I can make them want to impress me by sending me a car and a driver,

149
00:09:59,114 --> 00:10:00,655
so they have a shot at recruiting me.

150
00:10:02,155 --> 00:10:05,295
You told me that you were at the peak price right now.

151
00:10:05,394 --> 00:10:06,925
Today is the youngest you'll ever be...

152
00:10:26,214 --> 00:10:27,244
Mom.

153
00:10:27,915 --> 00:10:28,945
What?

154
00:10:30,585 --> 00:10:32,254
How much money should I put in my monthly savings account?

155
00:10:33,785 --> 00:10:36,884
I'm not sure. How much do you earn every month?

156
00:10:37,925 --> 00:10:39,854
When should I get married then?

157
00:10:41,525 --> 00:10:43,025
When I get married, where should I live?

158
00:10:43,864 --> 00:10:46,234
- Jun Ho. - How many children should I have?

159
00:10:47,195 --> 00:10:48,835
Do you want my child to be a daughter or a son?

160
00:10:49,535 --> 00:10:51,474
Right. I'm thinking about buying a car.

161
00:10:51,705 --> 00:10:53,104
Should I buy a new one or a used one?

162
00:10:53,374 --> 00:10:54,604
Which insurance company should I pick?

163
00:10:55,844 --> 00:10:56,844
Jun Ho.

164
00:10:59,945 --> 00:11:01,614
Is this my fault?

165
00:11:03,344 --> 00:11:04,854
Or are you and Dad going about this all wrong?

166
00:11:09,155 --> 00:11:11,854
For now, I'll say it's my fault.

167
00:11:11,854 --> 00:11:13,594
Maybe, I wasn't a trustworthy son to you.

168
00:11:14,025 --> 00:11:15,295
Gosh. That's not it.

169
00:11:15,295 --> 00:11:17,195
If you and Dad plan anything...

170
00:11:17,624 --> 00:11:19,134
about my life again,

171
00:11:21,734 --> 00:11:23,435
I might say harsher things to you then.

172
00:11:24,104 --> 00:11:25,705
When you have your own children...

173
00:11:25,905 --> 00:11:28,004
I doubt I would be able to do what you and Dad did.

174
00:11:28,905 --> 00:11:31,344
I wouldn't plan my child's life down to every minute and second.

175
00:11:34,144 --> 00:11:37,185
So my point is, you two should stop. You don't have to plan my life now.

176
00:11:40,114 --> 00:11:41,984
I don't understand what's gotten into you these days.

177
00:11:42,624 --> 00:11:44,425
- You're upsetting me. - What...

178
00:11:45,825 --> 00:11:49,364
Seriously? I'm perfectly healthy and have a job.

00:11:49,964 --> 00:11:51,695
I neither beat up nor con people.

180
00:11:53,295 --> 00:11:54,764
Why are you upset?

181
00:11:58,535 --> 00:12:00,835
You're upset because I can't satisfy your greed.

182
00:12:01,675 --> 00:12:03,405
Gosh. What a brat.

183
00:12:04,205 --> 00:12:06,675
When has anything ever gone wrong when you took my advice?

184
00:12:08,344 --> 00:12:09,344
Never.

185
00:12:10,344 --> 00:12:12,055
Thanks to you, I met Ms. Seo.

186
00:12:12,055 --> 00:12:13,384
Yes. So you went to a prestigious university...

187
00:12:13,384 --> 00:12:14,714
and got a nice job.

188
00:12:15,155 --> 00:12:17,425
I helped you get everything you would need to have a good life.

189
00:12:17,585 --> 00:12:20,195
Then how could you say harsh things about my effort?

190
00:12:21,665 --> 00:12:22,825
Will you keep this up?

191
00:12:25,634 --> 00:12:27,835
If I start fighting back without showing any mercy on you,

192
00:12:29,705 --> 00:12:30,805
you'll end up in tears.

193
00:12:54,825 --> 00:12:56,925
Mom. Here. Smack me.

194
00:13:00,335 --> 00:13:01,805
And stop worrying about me.

195
00:13:04,634 --> 00:13:07,805
I raised you without ever laying a hand on you.

196
00:13:11,874 --> 00:13:13,575
I'll call Dad.

197
00:13:14,415 --> 00:13:16,244
Don't bring this up to him. He might take it out on you.

198
00:13:16,844 --> 00:13:18,254
Tell him I'll give him a call.

200
00:14:06,335 --> 00:14:08,705
There is only one thing you can do.

201
00:14:10,705 --> 00:14:12,175
Show support.

202
00:14:12,705 --> 00:14:13,705
Go, Mr. Pyo!

203
00:14:16,575 --> 00:14:17,744
Let's go.

I've been thinking all night.

212
00:15:37,124 --> 00:15:38,894
Something doesn't feel right.

213
00:15:39,295 --> 00:15:40,455
What do you mean?

214
00:15:42,025 --> 00:15:43,925
I'm talking about the schoolteacher...

215

216
00:15:46,695 --> 00:15:47,734
Pyo...

217
00:15:48,504 --> 00:15:49,935
It's Pyo Sang Seob.

218
00:15:51,775 --> 00:15:54,675
It's odd that he personally came to our academy.

219
00:15:55,905 --> 00:15:57,144
I have a bad feeling about this.

220
00:15:58,175 --> 00:15:59,844
I should meet with him once.

221
00:16:00,945 --> 00:16:03,445
Perhaps, he has a selling point we're not aware of.

222
00:16:03,884 --> 00:16:06,114
He had been a schoolteacher for 20 years.

223
00:16:06,614 --> 00:16:09,325
He won't be able to compete against academy instructors.

224
00:16:11,555 --> 00:16:14,354
Ms. Woo. You know what a hand plow is, right?

225
00:16:16,224 --> 00:16:18,224
You know, the tool you use for farming.

226
00:16:18,224 --> 00:16:19,894
- I see. Yes. - The hand plow.

227
00:16:20,594 --> 00:16:22,935
Apparently, that tool sells like hotcakes in the US.

228
00:16:23,964 --> 00:16:26,004
Every house has a garden in the US.

229
00:16:26,575 --> 00:16:28,134

230
00:16:28,134 --> 00:16:30,004

231
00:16:30,244 --> 00:16:32,744
They had a taste of the new world with our hand plows.

232
00:16:34,744 --> 00:16:37,945
Thanks to that, the blacksmiths in the countryside...

233
00:16:38,144 --> 00:16:39,655
are thrilled...

234
00:16:39,655 --> 00:16:41,614
that our hand plows are in such high demand.

235
00:16:42,984 --> 00:16:44,055

236
00:16:47,055 --> 00:16:48,354

238
00:16:50,464 --> 00:16:52,964

where they are used, and for what purpose.

240
00:16:56,464 --> 00:16:57,565
Gosh.

241
00:17:04,905 --> 00:17:06,915
So this guy, Mr. Pyo...

242
00:17:08,275 --> 00:17:10,085
Let's recruit him if our conditions match.

243
00:17:12,755 --> 00:17:14,215

By any chance,

248
00:17:23,265 --> 00:17:26,634
do you also have Ms. Seo's next position in mind?

249
00:17:27,295 --> 00:17:28,604
Like a promotion, perhaps?

250
00:17:31,035 --> 00:17:32,674
I hope you're not disappointed.

251
00:17:35,674 --> 00:17:37,745
That I always stick up for Ms. Seo...

252

253
00:17:41,344 --> 00:17:42,444

254
00:17:43,614 --> 00:17:44,614
Pardon?

255
00:17:46,215 --> 00:17:49,184
I have a stronger sense of ownership in what I do than anyone else.

256
00:17:49,424 --> 00:17:51,424
I don't let my personal feelings get in the way of my work.

257
00:17:52,124 --> 00:17:53,454
Goodness.

258
00:17:54,194 --> 00:17:56,894
If that's how you interpreted what I said, I'm the disappointed one.

278
00:20:16,505 --> 00:20:19,835
you told us to try to finish reading a book within the semester.

279
00:20:21,975 --> 00:20:23,644
She thought it was homework, so she did it.

280

No, that's not true.

The book reading...

285
00:20:35,154 --> 00:20:38,225
I couldn't read a long novel because it was too hard.

286
00:20:39,194 --> 00:20:41,555
But I read a few short stories.

287
00:20:44,725 --> 00:20:47,465
How did you choose the short stories?

288
00:20:47,965 --> 00:20:51,465

Do you need me to write something for your student record?

292

No, it's not like that.

359
00:29:07,364 --> 00:29:08,735
You're also going to do something...

360
00:29:09,364 --> 00:29:11,134
about Mr. Pyo Sang Seob without telling me, right?

361
00:29:15,235 --> 00:29:16,275
Well...

362
00:29:22,614 --> 00:29:24,485
Mr. Pyo is going to give a free lecture.

363
00:29:25,015 --> 00:29:26,315
I'm sure he'll prepare something...

364
00:29:26,315 --> 00:29:27,654
totally different from his lessons at school.

365
00:29:28,854 --> 00:29:31,124
I was thinking that the kids should hear that lecture,

366
00:29:31,124 --> 00:29:32,424
and that I should help them...

367
00:29:32,795 --> 00:29:33,995
make a decision.

368
00:29:35,255 --> 00:29:36,265
It makes no sense.

369
00:29:37,664 --> 00:29:39,164
Director Choi Hyung Sun once told me...

370
00:29:40,194 --> 00:29:41,835
that she and I are alike in a way.

371
00:29:43,134 --> 00:29:44,535
My gosh.

372
00:29:45,305 --> 00:29:46,874
Gosh, how infuriating.

373
00:29:46,874 --> 00:29:49,344
If I were Director Choi, I wouldn't say...

374
00:29:50,045 --> 00:29:51,745
that Mr. Pyo has a long career as a lecturer. Two years at most?

375
00:29:53,715 --> 00:29:54,874
But that shouldn't be the case.

376
00:29:56,184 --> 00:29:57,215
So?

377
00:29:57,215 --> 00:30:00,354
Should I send a group message to my students and promote his lecture?

378
00:30:00,755 --> 00:30:02,684
Or should I go in front of the school and kneel?

379
00:30:04,124 --> 00:30:05,854
Or should I just ask him to come to our academy?

380
00:30:06,424 --> 00:30:07,654
I'm still thinking about it.

381
00:30:07,954 --> 00:30:09,725
Didn't you hear what I said?

382
00:30:10,065 --> 00:30:11,924
If you cause the academy the least bit of loss...

383
00:30:11,924 --> 00:30:13,594
I know. I do, but...

384
00:30:14,265 --> 00:30:16,134
even if I want to lose to him, it's hard to do that.

385
00:30:16,134 --> 00:30:17,404
That's what I'm worried about.

386
00:30:18,634 --> 00:30:21,305
Chanyoung High has been in my hands even back when you went there.

387
00:30:22,075 --> 00:30:23,904
Customer loyalty is way too high.

388
00:30:24,305 --> 00:30:25,604
You changed Si Woo's mind.

389
00:30:26,475 --> 00:30:27,874
He turned his back on Choisun Academy...

390
00:30:27,874 --> 00:30:28,874
who had Heewon High in their hands for 20 years.

391
00:30:28,874 --> 00:30:31,245
Gosh, we just got lucky on that.

392
00:30:32,715 --> 00:30:34,184
I don't think of it as luck.

393
00:30:36,755 --> 00:30:38,525
Out of all the things I accomplished...

394
00:30:38,525 --> 00:30:39,555
since I first met you,

395
00:30:41,124 --> 00:30:42,664
nothing was just by luck.

396
00:30:45,594 --> 00:30:48,495
Seo Hye Jin is a smart person.

397
00:30:48,765 --> 00:30:50,335
She has a quick mind and has talent too.

398
00:30:51,535 --> 00:30:54,475
I envy you for having a teacher like that.

399
00:30:55,235 --> 00:30:56,245
However,

400
00:30:56,944 --> 00:30:59,575
she can be a bit rude. And she doesn't fear anything.

401
00:31:01,414 --> 00:31:03,844
I've been doing this for 20 years.

402
00:31:04,815 --> 00:31:07,485
Out of all the teachers who teach that many students,

403
00:31:07,485 --> 00:31:10,654
I haven't seen very many who also have good manners.

404
00:31:16,594 --> 00:31:19,025
Then, was the reason why you hired Mr. Pyo Sang Seob...

405
00:31:19,434 --> 00:31:21,664
because you wanted to fix Seo Hye Jin's rude attitude?

406
00:31:21,664 --> 00:31:23,335
Gosh, no.

407
00:31:23,565 --> 00:31:24,805
I'm a saleswoman.

408
00:31:25,065 --> 00:31:28,134
What else would I want than to get more students?

409
00:31:30,944 --> 00:31:33,374
The best Korean lectures so far weren't actually the best!

410
00:31:35,344 --> 00:31:36,344
Gosh.

411
00:31:37,114 --> 00:31:39,485
Had I seen that advertisement beforehand,

412
00:31:39,755 --> 00:31:42,215
it would never have made it onto the streets.

413
00:31:42,755 --> 00:31:44,454
Seo Hye Jin crossed the line way too far.

414
00:31:44,954 --> 00:31:46,525
And she doesn't have...

415
00:31:46,654 --> 00:31:49,055
any respect for a senior in the field nor any business morality.

416
00:31:52,295 --> 00:31:55,434
When you swallowed your pride and offered to hire her,

417
00:31:55,434 --> 00:31:57,335
you must've promised her the best treatment.

418
00:31:57,505 --> 00:31:59,374
But I'm sure, with her attitude,

419
00:31:59,374 --> 00:32:01,305
she would've turned you down with some pretty rude comments.

420
00:32:01,305 --> 00:32:02,335
I know her very well.

421
00:32:04,704 --> 00:32:07,275
If it were me, I wouldn't forgive her.

422
00:32:08,174 --> 00:32:10,144
There's no use in wallowing in the past.

423
00:32:10,844 --> 00:32:12,914
Even you forgive and go on living...

424
00:32:13,515 --> 00:32:15,815
as you work for Kim Hyun Tak, a younger and less experienced boss.

425
00:32:18,025 --> 00:32:20,924
The story of how Kim Hyun Tak trampled on Victory Academy...

426
00:32:20,924 --> 00:32:22,394
and acquired it for a cheap price...

427
00:32:22,965 --> 00:32:24,325
I thought he was a cowardly act.

428
00:32:25,424 --> 00:32:28,535
You must've been devastated, but you endured it well.

429
00:32:30,434 --> 00:32:31,465
But I...

430
00:32:32,204 --> 00:32:34,374
am the type to wallow in the past.

431
00:32:37,275 --> 00:32:39,045
I want to go back to where I belong now.

432
00:32:42,174 --> 00:32:45,045
You've held out long. Has it been about seven years?

433
00:32:45,045 --> 00:32:46,154
It's nine years.

434
00:32:46,485 --> 00:32:49,424
It's been 8 years and 7 months, to be exact.

435
00:32:49,424 --> 00:32:51,325
Goodness, where has the time gone?

436
00:32:52,424 --> 00:32:55,894
Then, you should take at least half of the students with you.

437
00:32:56,055 --> 00:32:57,065
Gosh.

438
00:32:57,825 --> 00:32:59,394
That won't be enough...

439
00:32:59,894 --> 00:33:01,535
if you consider the interest.

440
00:33:09,944 --> 00:33:12,005
Ten years worth of Seo Hye Jin's lecture curricula.

441
00:33:12,944 --> 00:33:14,674
Reference materials, past exam questions,

442
00:33:14,674 --> 00:33:17,085
test papers, question trends per teacher,

443
00:33:17,085 --> 00:33:19,785
original files of her textbooks, and counseling notes. Everything.

444
00:33:20,684 --> 00:33:23,725
Oh, and there are phone numbers of her past assistants too.

445
00:33:24,025 --> 00:33:25,924
And they're the updated versions.

446
00:33:29,354 --> 00:33:30,664
You've brought me...

447
00:33:31,594 --> 00:33:33,295
Seo Hye Jin's head.

448
00:33:34,735 --> 00:33:37,565
But she's not that easy to take down,

449
00:33:37,565 --> 00:33:38,664
sadly enough.

450
00:33:38,835 --> 00:33:40,874
- That is true. - However,

451
00:33:42,335 --> 00:33:45,374
I think it would be possible under current circumstances.

452
00:33:46,674 --> 00:33:49,275
Seo Hye Jin is unlike her past self.

453
00:33:50,444 --> 00:33:52,215
She gave up her spot for an advertisement.

454
00:33:52,414 --> 00:33:54,384
She gave a free lecture.

455
00:33:55,384 --> 00:33:56,924
And she even took a whole weekend off...

456
00:33:56,924 --> 00:33:58,384
saying she wasn't feeling well.

457
00:34:09,704 --> 00:34:11,335
I'm curious about two things.

458
00:34:13,675 --> 00:34:15,735
Yes. Feel free to ask me.

459
00:34:15,735 --> 00:34:16,744
First.

460
00:34:17,874 --> 00:34:20,045
Why are you going after Seo Hye Jin's head?

461
00:34:20,845 --> 00:34:23,115
Isn't Director Kim Hyun Tak your target?

462
00:34:24,184 --> 00:34:27,085
Even if I shake up the academy in a huge way,

463
00:34:28,115 --> 00:34:29,624
it's only a matter of time...

464
00:34:29,885 --> 00:34:32,724
for Kim Hyun Tak to get back on his feet with Seo Hye Jin standing.

465
00:34:34,124 --> 00:34:35,854
Once, Seo Hye Jin was forced to give up...

466
00:34:35,854 --> 00:34:38,324
some of her students to another teacher.

467
00:34:39,025 --> 00:34:41,695
Still, Seo Hye Jin wasn't affected by it at all.

468
00:34:42,034 --> 00:34:43,135
No. In fact,

469
00:34:43,235 --> 00:34:46,005
it was as if someone had woken an angry viper by accident.

470
00:34:46,235 --> 00:34:47,574
She became even more confident.

471
00:34:48,034 --> 00:34:49,074
One should just...

472
00:34:50,275 --> 00:34:51,474
cut her out.

473
00:34:54,514 --> 00:34:57,144
And what is the reason for giving me these materials?

474
00:34:57,815 --> 00:34:59,784
Oh, well...

475
00:35:00,115 --> 00:35:01,585
To be exact,

476
00:35:01,585 --> 00:35:03,684
I'm not giving these to you but to Mr. Pyo.

477
00:35:03,684 --> 00:35:06,025
I thought he'd make the best use of these.

478
00:35:06,954 --> 00:35:09,054
Well, in the long run,

479
00:35:09,324 --> 00:35:12,365
you and I are competitors too.

480
00:35:12,934 --> 00:35:15,434
It'd be detrimental for me if you have these materials.

481
00:35:17,104 --> 00:35:19,704
If Mr. Pyo comes in person,

482
00:35:19,704 --> 00:35:21,604
I will let him access the files.

483
00:35:21,934 --> 00:35:23,945
Tell him to save it in his head.

484
00:35:27,175 --> 00:35:30,784
And what happens if I tell Mr. Kim Hyun Tak...

485
00:35:30,914 --> 00:35:32,244
about this?

486
00:35:40,954 --> 00:35:43,525
That would be a huge loss for you.

487
00:35:44,525 --> 00:35:46,994
You'd have to get rid of this studio apartment first,

488
00:35:47,764 --> 00:35:50,865
and your academy would take a hit as well.

489
00:35:57,604 --> 00:36:00,244
But, no matter how I think about this,

490
00:36:00,414 --> 00:36:01,945
it's too huge a present.

491
00:36:02,985 --> 00:36:03,985
Do I really...

492
00:36:04,644 --> 00:36:07,054
have to trample on Seo Hye Jin and nothing more?

493
00:36:10,525 --> 00:36:11,554
Of course.

494
00:36:15,695 --> 00:36:19,195
(Heeya Sliced Raw Bottom Round Steak)

495
00:37:00,175 --> 00:37:01,204
Let's go.

496
00:37:01,335 --> 00:37:03,175
Come to think of it, your textbooks are going to print soon.

497
00:37:03,175 --> 00:37:04,345
We don't have time for this.

498
00:37:07,715 --> 00:37:08,715
What's up?

499
00:37:10,744 --> 00:37:12,184
It's nothing. Let's go.

500
00:37:15,485 --> 00:37:16,824
You seem a bit off today.

501
00:37:20,054 --> 00:37:22,025
I thought you wouldn't hang out with me for a while,

502
00:37:22,224 --> 00:37:23,465
so I was just watching you.

503
00:37:26,965 --> 00:37:28,764
Don't worry too much about Mr. Pyo.

504
00:37:29,434 --> 00:37:30,735
I'll deal with it myself.

505
00:37:34,775 --> 00:37:35,775
Okay.

506
00:37:52,755 --> 00:37:53,824
Thank you for the meal.

507
00:37:55,854 --> 00:37:58,465
I came to repay the debt for giving me a ride home.

508
00:37:58,465 --> 00:37:59,494
No need to thank me.

509
00:38:00,795 --> 00:38:01,894
Don't you like cafeteria food?

510
00:38:02,434 --> 00:38:04,304
What? I don't dislike it.

511
00:38:05,505 --> 00:38:07,675
I was grateful for this back when I was a student.

512
00:38:09,135 --> 00:38:10,374
You must've been poor.

513
00:38:12,275 --> 00:38:14,345
How could you ask me that so casually?

514
00:38:16,644 --> 00:38:17,744
It's in the past tense.

515
00:38:20,715 --> 00:38:22,854
That's better than me. I'm poor right now.

516
00:38:24,025 --> 00:38:25,425
I've been curious for a while.

517
00:38:25,784 --> 00:38:26,795
Yes?

518
00:38:27,195 --> 00:38:28,655
Do you regret choosing to study more?

519
00:38:31,664 --> 00:38:34,065
By now, 9 out of 10 people say that they regret it,

520
00:38:35,764 --> 00:38:36,804
but I don't.

521
00:38:36,804 --> 00:38:37,934
Because you have rich parents?

522
00:38:39,005 --> 00:38:40,304
You don't have to worry about making a living?

523
00:38:41,005 --> 00:38:42,304
No, it's not like that.

524
00:38:43,974 --> 00:38:46,104
If I give up on marriage or having kids,

525
00:38:46,675 --> 00:38:47,845
I can take care of myself...

526
00:38:48,615 --> 00:38:50,445
on my own.

527
00:38:51,715 --> 00:38:53,385
Is that why you gave up dating too?

528
00:38:54,585 --> 00:38:55,615
What?

529
00:38:56,554 --> 00:38:57,624
What do you mean?

530
00:38:58,585 --> 00:38:59,894
I want to date.

531
00:39:01,054 --> 00:39:02,095
Forget it, then.

532
00:39:05,865 --> 00:39:07,335
There's someone I like too.

533
00:39:08,264 --> 00:39:09,264
I didn't ask.

534
00:39:10,635 --> 00:39:13,604
I heard she was about three years older than me.

535
00:39:17,104 --> 00:39:19,244
But she said she wasn't interested in younger guys,

536
00:39:20,244 --> 00:39:21,545
so I'm just scoping things out...

537
00:39:23,744 --> 00:39:24,744
by taking her to eat at the cafeteria.

538
00:39:40,695 --> 00:39:41,934
Try dating me.

539
00:39:43,835 --> 00:39:45,235
I won't be able to buy you expensive meals,

540
00:39:46,135 --> 00:39:47,534
but I can make life fun for you.

541
00:39:49,304 --> 00:39:50,874
What if I want to eat expensive meals?

542
00:39:53,974 --> 00:39:55,345
We can have Lee Jun Ho pay for that.

543
00:39:56,414 --> 00:39:58,014
I have a huge weakness of his.

544
00:39:59,144 --> 00:40:02,315
I don't think this would even make it to the director.

545
00:40:02,315 --> 00:40:04,655
I think the vice-director would turn it down first.

546
00:40:05,485 --> 00:40:07,425
Even with just two kids to sign up for a lecture,

547
00:40:07,425 --> 00:40:08,795
some academies open up the class.

548
00:40:09,354 --> 00:40:11,565
The minimum number of students I'm asking for is four.

549
00:40:11,795 --> 00:40:13,295
The regulation enforcement has become more rigid,

550
00:40:13,295 --> 00:40:15,635
so everyone has been splitting up large lectures into smaller ones.

551
00:40:15,635 --> 00:40:16,934
There are no lecture rooms.

552
00:40:16,934 --> 00:40:19,034
There aren't very many left, but it's not like there are none.

553
00:40:22,675 --> 00:40:26,045
We don't do small lectures.

554
00:40:27,115 --> 00:40:28,445
I think you already know why.

555
00:40:31,215 --> 00:40:32,715
The new lecturers...

556
00:40:33,045 --> 00:40:35,315
signed the contract with a monthly pay system for the first year.

557
00:40:35,755 --> 00:40:37,224
No matter how many students you teach.

558
00:40:37,224 --> 00:40:38,954
you're getting quite a large paycheck.

559
00:40:38,954 --> 00:40:40,354
Do you think you'd even cover...

560
00:40:40,354 --> 00:40:43,025
the cost of using a classroom, your expenses, and all that?

561
00:40:43,425 --> 00:40:44,894
And you use so much paper too.

562
00:40:45,695 --> 00:40:47,195
I'm not saying I'd only teach four kids.

563
00:40:47,195 --> 00:40:49,565
I'm saying let me open the class as long as I get four to sign up.

564
00:40:50,565 --> 00:40:53,034
There's something I want to do, and I can make it a huge hit.

565
00:40:55,505 --> 00:40:57,144
What do you want to do?

566
00:40:57,505 --> 00:40:58,574
Teach great lectures.

567
00:41:04,715 --> 00:41:07,115
I want to believe you, but...

568
00:41:07,115 --> 00:41:08,215
I don't mind if there are no windows.

569
00:41:08,215 --> 00:41:09,954
It can be a room in the corner.

570
00:41:12,184 --> 00:41:14,025
This is going to be a headache.

571
00:41:15,054 --> 00:41:17,525
I'll ask about the classroom,

572
00:41:17,724 --> 00:41:19,724
but then...

573
00:41:20,795 --> 00:41:23,804
I won't know if what you're teaching is right or good.

574
00:41:24,405 --> 00:41:26,934
Write something down.

575
00:41:27,405 --> 00:41:29,804
Even as a formality,

576
00:41:29,804 --> 00:41:31,474
bring something on a piece of paper...

577
00:41:31,474 --> 00:41:33,514
if you want to please the people high up.

578
00:41:33,675 --> 00:41:35,874
- Okay. - Make sure you have that.

579
00:41:36,445 --> 00:41:37,615
Sincerity.

580
00:41:38,885 --> 00:41:41,815
I'm this free only a few days a year.

581
00:41:43,215 --> 00:41:45,755
I get to relax just a few days before the vacation starts.

582
00:41:46,425 --> 00:41:49,255
You must know I work until late every day.

583
00:41:51,764 --> 00:41:54,394
Do you know what the strength of people who like to study is?

584
00:41:55,835 --> 00:41:56,934
They do just fine on their own.

585
00:42:04,275 --> 00:42:06,405
- What's that? - An alarm.

586
00:42:07,615 --> 00:42:10,885
You don't have to take medication on time, do you?

587
00:42:12,184 --> 00:42:13,784
I decided to slack off only until right now.

588
00:42:14,585 --> 00:42:15,655
What?

589
00:42:17,385 --> 00:42:19,724
We were discussing something very important.

590
00:42:20,155 --> 00:42:21,224
And you're leaving?

591
00:42:21,224 --> 00:42:23,324
I have to proofread my material once more before it goes to print.

592
00:42:26,195 --> 00:42:27,195
Gosh.

593
00:42:28,695 --> 00:42:31,835
I thought I was pretty good and making others flustered.

594
00:42:33,065 --> 00:42:34,104
Have fun on your own.

595
00:42:35,135 --> 00:42:36,135
You said you did that just fine.

596
00:42:37,545 --> 00:42:38,545
But...

597
00:42:38,545 --> 00:42:40,414
Bye. You don't have to get up.

598
00:42:43,345 --> 00:42:44,815
I can proofread too.

599
00:42:46,184 --> 00:42:48,715
I read over 1,000 pages of our professors' papers...

600
00:42:54,454 --> 00:42:57,764
(Chanyoung High School, 1st Year, Sung Ha Yul)

601
00:43:12,244 --> 00:43:13,244
You're still here?

602
00:43:15,644 --> 00:43:16,675
What?

603
00:43:18,514 --> 00:43:19,545
I should go.

604
00:43:22,514 --> 00:43:25,824
The principal will ask to see you tomorrow.

605
00:43:26,795 --> 00:43:27,795
Okay.

606
00:43:33,095 --> 00:43:34,465
Shall we get a drink?

607
00:43:36,865 --> 00:43:39,764
Next time. I'll treat you then.

608
00:43:40,905 --> 00:43:42,505
I have stuff to do today.

609
00:43:44,074 --> 00:43:45,104
Okay.

610
00:43:49,715 --> 00:43:51,715
(Chanyoung High School, 1st Year, Sung Ha Yul)

611
00:43:53,014 --> 00:43:55,914
(Challenge! Read a book a semester!)

612
00:44:12,764 --> 00:44:13,804
Hello?

613
00:44:14,374 --> 00:44:16,574
There's too much. It's confusing.

614
00:44:16,574 --> 00:44:17,574
I see.

615
00:44:18,244 --> 00:44:19,304
He's the one...

616
00:44:20,244 --> 00:44:22,574
who made this choice.

617
00:44:23,144 --> 00:44:24,744
All I did was make an offer.

618
00:44:25,885 --> 00:44:26,914
An offer...

619
00:44:26,914 --> 00:44:28,715
- Are you here? - Fill it in.

620
00:44:28,715 --> 00:44:30,485
- Come to the fifth floor. - The poet.

621
00:44:30,485 --> 00:44:31,655
Okay.

622
00:44:31,655 --> 00:44:34,095
Yes. It's here at last.

623
00:44:34,894 --> 00:44:37,124
The courier brought Mr. Lee's and my sample textbooks.

624
00:44:37,124 --> 00:44:38,195
See you.

625
00:44:46,434 --> 00:44:47,434
Okay?

626
00:44:48,735 --> 00:44:49,934
The next question.

627
00:44:59,744 --> 00:45:00,755
What are you doing?

628
00:45:01,554 --> 00:45:04,054
I was going through some material.

629
00:45:06,224 --> 00:45:07,954
That material.

630
00:45:09,255 --> 00:45:12,324
Isn't it something one shouldn't share or try to take a peek at?

631
00:45:14,695 --> 00:45:15,735
Vice-director.

632
00:45:17,135 --> 00:45:18,135
Yes?

633
00:45:19,405 --> 00:45:20,934
I feel the need...

634
00:45:20,934 --> 00:45:23,945
for you to view your situation more objectively.

635
00:45:27,045 --> 00:45:28,215
Imagine this.

636
00:45:29,315 --> 00:45:30,514
An older man...

637
00:45:30,514 --> 00:45:33,445
who could've stayed on and retired as...

638
00:45:33,655 --> 00:45:35,215
a middling schoolteacher.

639
00:45:36,954 --> 00:45:41,054
He also happened to have been taught a harsh lesson by an instructor,

640
00:45:41,324 --> 00:45:43,764
and he decided to challenge her.

641
00:45:44,295 --> 00:45:45,465
At an academy.

642
00:45:47,235 --> 00:45:49,065
Your first opponent is Seo Hye Jin.

643
00:45:50,304 --> 00:45:53,804
She teaches 300 Chanyoung High students each year.

644
00:45:54,635 --> 00:45:56,874
Kids who live and study here are picky,

645
00:45:56,874 --> 00:45:59,405
and she has their utmost support.

646
00:45:59,405 --> 00:46:00,474
I'm aware of...

647
00:46:00,974 --> 00:46:03,275
my situation and what I must do.

648
00:46:03,815 --> 00:46:05,385
- Are you really? - Yes.

649
00:46:06,345 --> 00:46:08,184
So I'll prepare as best I can...

650
00:46:12,054 --> 00:46:14,054
You don't seem to know.

651
00:46:17,525 --> 00:46:20,065
Preparing as best you can...

652
00:46:20,065 --> 00:46:21,465
is a given. It's so basic.

653
00:46:23,295 --> 00:46:25,565
What else must I do?

654
00:46:27,175 --> 00:46:29,635
What I need you to do is win.

655
00:46:30,304 --> 00:46:32,845
A 99-percent win rate won't do it for me.

656
00:46:33,104 --> 00:46:34,445
It must be 100 percent.

657
00:46:37,744 --> 00:46:40,144
"The results will reflect the hard work..."

658
00:46:40,144 --> 00:46:41,854
"I put in, so I'll just do my best."

659
00:46:42,684 --> 00:46:45,954
You don't have that naive mindset, do you?

660
00:46:46,354 --> 00:46:49,724
I have more than enough teaching material.

661
00:47:28,664 --> 00:47:30,164
What's this?

662
00:47:30,764 --> 00:47:32,034
The left is from last year's...

663
00:47:32,034 --> 00:47:34,974
second-semester final exam for Chanyoung High's tenth grade.

664
00:47:36,135 --> 00:47:39,775
The right is a question Seo Hye Jin told her students to study in case.

665
00:47:40,615 --> 00:47:43,815
She recommended and got right a passage that wasn't in...

666
00:47:43,815 --> 00:47:46,385
the textbook or any secondary teaching material.

667
00:47:47,655 --> 00:47:49,054
The multiple choice options are different,

668
00:47:50,155 --> 00:47:51,784
but how excited do you think...

669
00:47:51,784 --> 00:47:53,454
the students were when they saw that?

670
00:47:55,525 --> 00:47:59,124
And how many more students do you think flocked to her classes?

671
00:48:00,735 --> 00:48:03,534
That happens almost every semester.

672
00:48:03,534 --> 00:48:04,565
Now...

673
00:48:05,264 --> 00:48:09,534
do you see who exactly you're up against?

674
00:48:13,144 --> 00:48:14,175
Yes.

675
00:48:14,175 --> 00:48:16,744
This is what you will see in the material that was offered.

676
00:48:17,845 --> 00:48:21,255
The school's exam trend, the KSAT pattern,

677
00:48:21,255 --> 00:48:23,284
the personal taste and style of each teacher,

678
00:48:23,284 --> 00:48:25,284
the change in that teacher's taste,

679
00:48:25,284 --> 00:48:27,195
even all the mock exam questions.

680
00:48:27,824 --> 00:48:29,795
It will all be there.

681
00:48:30,224 --> 00:48:32,724
Naturally, you'll be able to learn how Seo Hye Jin...

682
00:48:32,824 --> 00:48:34,494
decides what to expect in each exam.

683
00:48:36,695 --> 00:48:37,735
But you're...

684
00:48:39,034 --> 00:48:40,235
not playing fair.

685
00:48:42,074 --> 00:48:43,974
It's only against the rules if the referee notices.

686
00:48:44,275 --> 00:48:47,815
Who will say it's unfair if no one sees it?

687
00:48:54,485 --> 00:48:55,514
I met up...

688
00:48:56,184 --> 00:48:59,025
with Seo Hye Jin and shook her up.

689
00:49:00,525 --> 00:49:03,994
I told her you would be quite a threat.

690
00:49:12,135 --> 00:49:15,934
At midnight tonight, go to the place on the note.

691
00:49:16,835 --> 00:49:19,505
Vice-director Woo Seung Hui will be waiting.

692
00:49:29,155 --> 00:49:30,684
- Where are you going? - To the library.

693
00:49:30,684 --> 00:49:32,525
To help the new instructors proofread their textbooks.

694
00:49:33,485 --> 00:49:35,894
They must fend for themselves. Why would you help?

695
00:49:36,025 --> 00:49:37,865
She can help if she wants.

696
00:49:38,925 --> 00:49:40,065
Why are you throwing it out?

697
00:49:40,894 --> 00:49:41,934
Because I don't need it.

698
00:49:42,635 --> 00:49:43,635
Wait. This is...

699
00:49:43,635 --> 00:49:46,005
We just have to send it to the printer tomorrow.

700
00:49:47,405 --> 00:49:48,434
Why are you shredding this?

701
00:49:49,804 --> 00:49:51,874
It's useless. I'm going to start over.

702
00:49:53,074 --> 00:49:54,175
Why?

703
00:49:55,275 --> 00:49:56,345
Because you can find...

704
00:49:56,675 --> 00:49:59,215
a hundred thousand books like this in Daechi-dong.

705
00:50:01,155 --> 00:50:02,914
No, wait.

706
00:50:05,284 --> 00:50:06,324
Why are you doing this?

707
00:50:08,954 --> 00:50:11,065

(Satirist novels)

720
00:50:42,624 --> 00:50:44,894
(Chae Man Sik's...)

721
00:51:06,485 --> 00:51:08,414
I rarely get angry,

722
00:51:09,684 --> 00:51:11,824
but yesterday, I got so angry I almost died.

723
00:51:11,985 --> 00:51:13,624
What happened yesterday?

724
00:51:14,155 --> 00:51:16,655
I barged in to see Choisun Academy's director...

725
00:51:16,655 --> 00:51:17,994
and got beaten up.

726
00:51:18,164 --> 00:51:19,224
What?

727
00:51:19,394 --> 00:51:21,865
What? No, don't be so surprised. She beat me up verbally.

728
00:51:22,965 --> 00:51:24,704
I couldn't stand or accept...

729
00:51:24,704 --> 00:51:26,434
what Choi Hyung Sun said to Ms. Seo.

730
00:51:27,804 --> 00:51:28,874
"Okay, fine."

731
00:51:29,574 --> 00:51:30,704
"You ruined our free lecture,"

732
00:51:30,704 --> 00:51:32,104
"scouted a schoolteacher,"

733
00:51:32,104 --> 00:51:34,845
"talked crap, and tried to pull tricks."

734
00:51:34,845 --> 00:51:35,914
"Do whatever you want."

735
00:51:36,345 --> 00:51:37,914
"It's the class that students pick."

736
00:51:37,914 --> 00:51:39,045
"I'll pay you back with my teaching."

737
00:51:41,155 --> 00:51:42,715
So I looked at the material I'd made.

738
00:51:42,914 --> 00:51:44,184
And what?

739
00:51:45,925 --> 00:51:47,525
I wasn't good enough to make her pay.

740
00:51:49,695 --> 00:51:51,724
No, it's good work.

741
00:51:52,065 --> 00:51:53,565
Classes start soon.

742
00:51:53,565 --> 00:51:55,465
Call the printer and ask for another copy.

743
00:51:55,465 --> 00:51:57,664
- If you get it couriered... - I'll make the materials again.

744
00:51:58,505 --> 00:51:59,664
There's no time.

745
00:52:00,675 --> 00:52:03,304
I don't need fancy designs or expensive paper.

746
00:52:03,405 --> 00:52:04,845
I didn't learn with that.

747
00:52:05,045 --> 00:52:07,244
Think of how crappy your first teaching materials were.

748
00:52:07,244 --> 00:52:08,775
Mr. Lee.

749
00:52:08,874 --> 00:52:10,144
Si Woo said that...

750
00:52:10,985 --> 00:52:12,945
unlike other subjects, when he studies Korean,

751
00:52:13,345 --> 00:52:15,315
it feels like he's not well-prepared.

752
00:52:15,315 --> 00:52:16,684
He's left with a bad aftertaste.

753
00:52:16,885 --> 00:52:19,255
That's because he's just a tenth-grader...

754
00:52:19,255 --> 00:52:22,195
You can't eliminate that aftertaste with a common approach.

755
00:52:22,195 --> 00:52:24,525
It's common because it was tried and tested.

756
00:52:24,795 --> 00:52:26,264
I came up with a new full-mark strategy.

757
00:52:26,865 --> 00:52:29,635
It worked on eighth-class me and first-class me.

758
00:52:29,735 --> 00:52:31,135
What is he on about?

759
00:52:32,065 --> 00:52:33,405
I'll teach them how to read.

760
00:52:34,204 --> 00:52:37,074
They need to form muscles so they can tackle any passage.

761
00:52:37,974 --> 00:52:39,945
Forget teaching skills on how to get things right.

762
00:52:39,945 --> 00:52:40,945
We must teach the essence.

763
00:52:41,574 --> 00:52:42,845
I can get them to read...

764
00:52:42,845 --> 00:52:45,085
and instinctively find the correct answer.

765
00:52:45,644 --> 00:52:47,485
They just have to follow me patiently.

766
00:52:48,215 --> 00:52:50,954
Kids with poor grades will improve much more,

767
00:52:51,255 --> 00:52:54,525
and kids with good grades can trust in themselves.

768
00:52:54,925 --> 00:52:56,795
What kind of dreamy nonsense is this?

769
00:52:57,695 --> 00:53:00,865
The smart kids will consider me a mentor.

770
00:53:01,764 --> 00:53:04,034
Because they'll know it'll help them for the rest of their lives.

771
00:53:07,135 --> 00:53:09,175
You won't play with me for a while.

772
00:53:11,474 --> 00:53:12,474
Gosh.

773
00:53:13,244 --> 00:53:16,144
I think your judgment is clouded because of me.

774
00:53:16,144 --> 00:53:17,244
I'm sorry.

775
00:53:17,815 --> 00:53:19,244
I shouldn't have said that.

776
00:53:19,414 --> 00:53:22,385
You can get bored if you stare at this for days.

777
00:53:22,485 --> 00:53:24,284
Send it to me. I'll proofread it for you.

778
00:53:24,385 --> 00:53:26,085
Stop saying you'll do things for me.

779
00:53:26,085 --> 00:53:28,624
Okay, then. Let's look through it together.

780
00:53:28,624 --> 00:53:30,354
- Send me the file first. - I deleted it.

781
00:53:32,264 --> 00:53:33,324
It's not funny.

782
00:53:33,994 --> 00:53:35,595
- I'm serious. - Lee Jun Ho!

783
00:53:41,534 --> 00:53:42,635
Are they fighting?

784
00:53:44,304 --> 00:53:46,545
Wait. Ms. Seo.

785
00:53:47,574 --> 00:53:49,675
We still have most of the first draft...

786
00:53:49,775 --> 00:53:51,414
and the file on the printing company's cloud.

787
00:53:51,414 --> 00:53:53,045
We can restore everything.

788
00:53:53,845 --> 00:53:55,514
Do you think teaching kids is a joke?

789
00:53:56,115 --> 00:53:57,255
Excuse me.

790
00:53:57,255 --> 00:53:58,824
I'm telling you this because it's not.

791
00:53:58,854 --> 00:54:00,695
You destroyed a textbook you worked on all semester.

792
00:54:01,595 --> 00:54:02,595
How is it not a joke?

793
00:54:02,595 --> 00:54:04,994
We need a new curriculum if we're to teach properly.

794
00:54:04,994 --> 00:54:06,764
- Don't let your emotions take over. - Go back inside.

795
00:54:06,764 --> 00:54:09,195
Be responsible. Forget about lifelong benefits.

796
00:54:10,565 --> 00:54:11,635
Don't belittle me.

797
00:54:12,264 --> 00:54:14,405
What's this about essence and being able to read?

798
00:54:14,874 --> 00:54:16,405
If you want to stress that, go into politics.

799
00:54:16,405 --> 00:54:17,945
You're smart. Take the civil service exam.

800
00:54:17,945 --> 00:54:19,345
Ditch the sarcasm.

801
00:54:19,345 --> 00:54:21,215
It's the same as saying you'll cancel the KSAT!

802
00:54:21,215 --> 00:54:23,845
Will you follow every kid when they take an exam?

803
00:54:24,414 --> 00:54:26,914
What if they come across a question that your skills don't work on?

804
00:54:27,854 --> 00:54:30,854
Will you coax each flustered kid and walk them through the passage?

805
00:54:32,425 --> 00:54:35,394
There's no true first class until the kids are able to read...

806
00:54:35,394 --> 00:54:36,894
and tackle any question on their own.

807
00:54:36,994 --> 00:54:38,065
Saying that means...

808
00:54:38,065 --> 00:54:39,994
there's no correct answer to teaching Korean.

809
00:54:41,135 --> 00:54:43,965
I don't want to persuade or convince people who think so.

810
00:54:44,604 --> 00:54:46,764
At school, the schoolteachers decide what's right or wrong.

811
00:54:46,905 --> 00:54:48,735
There's a whole organization behind the KSAT.

812
00:54:48,735 --> 00:54:50,704
You said they would need to follow you patiently.

813
00:54:50,704 --> 00:54:54,005
- That's a massive topic. - That's the same as failing to...

814
00:54:54,005 --> 00:54:55,115
- achieve short-term results. - Mr. Lee.

815
00:54:55,644 --> 00:54:57,115
- Trust me... - He's cooler when he's defiant.

816
00:54:57,115 --> 00:54:58,644
How many exams are there in a year?

817
00:54:58,644 --> 00:55:00,644
A mock exam, the midterms, a mock exam, the finals.

818
00:55:00,644 --> 00:55:01,715
That happens each semester.

819
00:55:01,715 --> 00:55:03,554
Ms. Seo talks down on him a bit too much.

820
00:55:03,655 --> 00:55:05,224
They're both instructors if you think about it.

821
00:55:05,224 --> 00:55:06,724
That rules their life forever.

822
00:55:07,854 --> 00:55:11,164
We need to show obvious results and fast.

823
00:55:12,065 --> 00:55:13,664
Do you brag that you went to a great university?

824
00:55:18,204 --> 00:55:19,335
I don't.

825
00:55:19,335 --> 00:55:22,275
With that degree, you worked at a huge company and now you're here.

826
00:55:22,275 --> 00:55:24,945
And then what? If this fails, you can try something else.

827
00:55:24,945 --> 00:55:26,775
You know what a degree means.

828
00:55:26,775 --> 00:55:28,775
It's a status that follows you around forever.

829
00:55:29,144 --> 00:55:31,744
Just one question could change their future status...

830
00:55:31,744 --> 00:55:32,845
and you're talking nonsense?

831
00:55:32,845 --> 00:55:34,815
Getting one more question right in a Korean exam?

832
00:55:35,985 --> 00:55:38,054
That's not my goal. My goal is...

833
00:55:38,425 --> 00:55:40,925
to help the kids get better grades in every subject.

834
00:55:40,925 --> 00:55:42,354
Then teach elementary school kids.

835
00:55:42,354 --> 00:55:43,824
Teach Korean, math, social studies, and science.

836
00:55:43,824 --> 00:55:44,925
Teach music and PE too!

837
00:55:44,925 --> 00:55:47,865
You need to think about why you're my forever mentor!

838
00:55:52,565 --> 00:55:54,065
While you taught me,

839
00:55:54,835 --> 00:55:56,204
my grades improved overall.

840
00:55:56,775 --> 00:55:59,604
You know better than anyone how that happened.

841
00:56:00,604 --> 00:56:02,914
We teach the most basic subject.

842
00:56:03,644 --> 00:56:04,744
"Hong Kyung Rae's Revolt?"

843
00:56:05,184 --> 00:56:07,414
Kids read the title and think something revolting's going on.

844
00:56:07,414 --> 00:56:10,115
Giving them a book, telling them what question to memorize,

845
00:56:10,115 --> 00:56:13,155
and telling them to circle words? What's the point in that?

846
00:56:14,954 --> 00:56:16,324
I'll teach the language first.

847
00:56:16,324 --> 00:56:18,925
I'll expand their horizons and get them to imagine.

848
00:56:19,264 --> 00:56:21,135
If we teach tenth-graders to understand vocab,

849
00:56:21,135 --> 00:56:23,295
sentences, passages, then how to read between the lines,

850
00:56:23,494 --> 00:56:25,764
their status that you talked about will change!

851
00:56:25,764 --> 00:56:27,635
If you follow that step each time,

852
00:56:27,635 --> 00:56:29,204
how many passages can you go through per class?

853
00:56:29,204 --> 00:56:30,235
Who cares...

854
00:56:30,874 --> 00:56:32,804
Who cares how many we manage?

855
00:56:32,804 --> 00:56:34,675
It'll be slow at first, but we'll pick up speed.

856
00:56:34,675 --> 00:56:36,144
Do you think parents pay...

857
00:56:36,144 --> 00:56:38,644
hundreds of dollars per subject for you to teach that?

858
00:56:38,744 --> 00:56:41,784
My gosh. I can hear them weep from here.

859
00:56:42,554 --> 00:56:43,585
It's cheap.

860
00:56:43,954 --> 00:56:45,224
The skill will last forever.

861
00:56:45,224 --> 00:56:47,485
This is an academy for teens. It's not a lifelong learning center.

862
00:56:47,655 --> 00:56:49,494
Excuse me.

863
00:56:49,925 --> 00:56:52,164
You both need to cool down.

864
00:56:53,465 --> 00:56:55,365
I'm glad you said that.

865
00:56:56,235 --> 00:56:58,264
Go outside and get some air.

866
00:56:58,264 --> 00:57:00,835
And see how many academies there are in a 100m radius.

867
00:57:01,034 --> 00:57:04,135
If your method worked, they would have no reason to exist.

868
00:57:04,474 --> 00:57:06,644
Their parents would keep kids home to read.

869
00:57:07,175 --> 00:57:10,175
Your method never worked since entrance exams were created,

870
00:57:10,175 --> 00:57:11,485
and it never will work!

871
00:57:11,485 --> 00:57:13,684
I'll do what the parents can't.

872
00:57:14,014 --> 00:57:16,385
It's the only way one of my students will be the best in the country.

873
00:57:16,385 --> 00:57:18,184
That's what worked for me,

874
00:57:18,284 --> 00:57:20,184
and I'll teach what worked for me.

875
00:57:20,184 --> 00:57:22,295
What worked for you ten years ago?

876
00:57:22,295 --> 00:57:23,824
Are you going to be drunk on that forever?

877
00:57:23,824 --> 00:57:25,965
I'm not drunk on it. That's the essence!

878
00:57:27,065 --> 00:57:28,795
You're the one that's drunk!

879
00:57:30,195 --> 00:57:31,735
Drunk on the Daechi-dong way...

880
00:57:31,735 --> 00:57:33,465
that teaches kids what notes to take!

881
00:57:33,565 --> 00:57:35,135
Mr. Lee.

882
00:57:36,405 --> 00:57:37,505
That was harsh.

883
00:57:38,744 --> 00:57:39,804
Gosh.

884
00:57:40,914 --> 00:57:42,945
Go back to the office. I'll handle it.

885
00:57:53,925 --> 00:57:54,994
Get your file.

886
00:57:57,624 --> 00:57:58,664
I don't want to.

887
00:57:58,824 --> 00:58:01,065
Download the file you sent to the printing company...

888
00:58:02,534 --> 00:58:04,635
and stay up all night if you must and proofread it completely.

889
00:58:04,804 --> 00:58:06,164
I won't teach with that crap.

890
00:58:07,304 --> 00:58:08,835
I even deleted the original file.

891

Follow me and I'll kill you.

892
00:58:16,275 --> 00:58:17,374
Darn it.

893
00:58:32,664 --> 00:58:33,865
Where are you going?

894
00:58:38,164 --> 00:58:39,465
You're too emotional right now.

895
00:58:41,675 --> 00:58:42,735
Because I'm human.

896
00:58:44,474 --> 00:58:46,974
Hye Jin. Control yourself. People are watching.

897
00:58:47,845 --> 00:58:48,874
Exactly.

898
00:58:50,144 --> 00:58:51,144
Let me be alone.

899

She's not picking up, is she?

910

No.

911
01:02:38,345 --> 01:02:39,345
She said she wanted to be alone.

912

No one's any help. See you.

Is it your first time here?

918
01:03:46,874 --> 01:03:47,905
Yes.

919
01:03:48,474 --> 01:03:50,175
- Someone mentioned the place. - I see.

920
01:03:51,175 --> 01:03:52,315

921
01:03:55,684 --> 01:03:56,885

How will you search the whole of Daechi-dong?

925
01:04:44,905 --> 01:04:47,365
She could've gone to see her lawyer friend Ms. Cha.

926
01:04:47,365 --> 01:04:48,675
Check out Night Flight.

927

I'd like to help you search,

929

Sorry. I'm a bit...

935
01:05:19,104 --> 01:05:20,635
I'm in shock.

936
01:05:30,775 --> 01:05:32,144
Ten years' worth of material.

937
01:05:35,054 --> 01:05:36,054
That's crazy.

938
01:05:42,394 --> 01:05:43,554
It was an enticing offer.

939

940

I imagined becoming extremely rich in a short time.

941

Why are you telling me this...

942
01:05:56,304 --> 01:05:58,275
instead of taking the material?

943
01:05:59,545 --> 01:06:00,545
I wonder as well.

944
01:06:05,885 --> 01:06:07,885
You know Sung Ha Yul, don't you?

945
01:06:08,585 --> 01:06:11,184

During an after-school class,

950
01:06:39,715 --> 01:06:41,854
I told the kids to read one book...

951
01:06:42,284 --> 01:06:43,454
per semester.

952
01:06:46,385 --> 01:06:48,255
I thought no one had taken it seriously.

953
01:06:50,554 --> 01:06:51,565
But...

954
01:06:53,095 --> 01:06:54,664
she wrote that over the semester.

955
01:06:57,295 --> 01:06:58,635
I felt so embarrassed.

956
01:07:02,135 --> 01:07:04,675
I was ashamed for talking about my beliefs as an educator...

957
01:07:06,074 --> 01:07:08,315
after being humiliated for fixating on an old-school question.

958
01:07:10,144 --> 01:07:13,045
And I felt ashamed that a student had listened to me.

959
01:07:14,585 --> 01:07:15,615
More than anything,

960
01:07:16,854 --> 01:07:18,454
after all that showing off,

961
01:07:20,554 --> 01:07:22,695
I had ignored and turned against my students.

962
01:07:23,095 --> 01:07:24,155
That hit me the most.

963
01:07:30,565 --> 01:07:33,764

970
01:08:03,394 --> 01:08:04,865

971
01:08:06,434 --> 01:08:07,565
My own way.

972
01:08:08,164 --> 01:08:09,974
That's what worked for me,

973
01:08:10,275 --> 01:08:12,505
and I'll teach what worked for me.

979

983

But what?

984
01:08:43,635 --> 01:08:46,574
But while you're at Choisun Academy,

985
01:08:47,105 --> 01:08:48,774
you need to become...

986
01:08:49,045 --> 01:08:51,345

987
01:08:52,284 --> 01:08:55,715
To do that, I think it would be best if you don't...
