 The Midnight Romance in Hagwon 

13
00:00:44,020 --> 00:00:54,340


14
00:00:54,340 --> 00:00:56,260
 They still taught the class? 

15
00:00:56,260 --> 00:00:57,400
 Yes. 

16
00:00:57,400 --> 00:01:01,420
I contacted Lee Si Wu since he didn't come to the class today.

17
00:01:01,420 --> 00:01:03,330
Are you sure it was only Lee Si Wu?

18
00:01:03,330 --> 00:01:05,390
Kids from other academies could've gone.

19
00:01:05,390 --> 00:01:06,670
He was alone, apparently.

20
00:01:06,670 --> 00:01:10,980
It was supposed to be two hours, but it got longer.

21
00:01:12,770 --> 00:01:16,800
He skipped my class but stayed at that class until the end?

22
00:01:17,380 --> 00:01:20,860
I'll ask him for details during the class next week.

23
00:01:22,610 --> 00:01:24,700
I'd like to hear it soon.

24
00:01:24,700 --> 00:01:26,710
About what they talked about.

25
00:01:26,710 --> 00:01:29,200
 Episode 5 

26
00:01:33,510 --> 00:01:35,560
- I'll go now.
 - Thank you.

27
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:38,760
- Take care. 
 - See you.
 - Bye.

28
00:01:49,710 --> 00:01:51,970
We still need to talk more, right?

29
00:01:51,970 --> 00:01:54,510
I got so dizzy that I thought I'd die.

30
00:01:54,510 --> 00:01:56,370
Let's walk a bit.

31
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:03,910
Well, why don't you help me here if you're free?

32
00:02:03,910 --> 00:02:05,620
Hold on.

33
00:02:05,620 --> 00:02:08,110
I'm thinking about another man right now.

34
00:02:08,110 --> 00:02:11,140
Who? Mr. Lee Jun Ho?

35
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:13,260
Isn't he kind of strange?

36
00:02:13,260 --> 00:02:15,360
What do you mean? How?

37
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:19,640
To be specific, when he's around, Seo Hye Jin...

38
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:21,140
She's kind of weird.

39
00:02:21,140 --> 00:02:23,030
What do you mean?

40
00:02:23,830 --> 00:02:28,200
Strangely, it feels like I'm seeing the old Seo Hye Jin.

41
00:02:30,550 --> 00:02:32,070
That could happen.

42
00:02:32,070 --> 00:02:36,200
Your old habits come out when you see friends from elementary school.

43
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:41,000
Like how you talk like a soldier when you see your old military buddies.

44
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,520
I never joined the military.

45
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:45,870
It's just an example. An example.

46
00:02:45,870 --> 00:02:48,870
Men tend to be like that.

47
00:02:48,870 --> 00:02:50,610
Is that it?

48
00:03:00,490 --> 00:03:02,190
Aren't you cold?

49
00:03:02,190 --> 00:03:04,550
No, I'm okay.

50
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:12,890
What are you thinking about?

51
00:03:14,570 --> 00:03:16,200
Si Wu.

52
00:03:17,940 --> 00:03:19,610
Me, too.

53
00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:23,890
Will he remember us positively?

54
00:03:24,590 --> 00:03:27,100
He'd never be able to forget.

55
00:03:27,100 --> 00:03:28,790
How do you know?

56
00:03:28,790 --> 00:03:31,070
I'm the living proof.

57
00:03:31,070 --> 00:03:33,490
I've never forgotten.

58
00:03:36,910 --> 00:03:38,760
But it's kind of unfair.

59
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:40,580
What do you mean?

60
00:03:40,580 --> 00:03:45,790
The lecture today was about twice as good as my first class.

61
00:03:45,790 --> 00:03:51,750
Because Mr. Lee Jun Ho taught half of today's class.

62
00:03:53,930 --> 00:03:56,360
Didn't you get flustered?

63
00:03:56,360 --> 00:03:59,150
We used less than half of the material we prepared.

64
00:03:59,150 --> 00:04:00,850
Not at all.

65
00:04:00,850 --> 00:04:03,820
But I wondered what you thought at that moment.

66
00:04:03,820 --> 00:04:06,810
You don't have to tell me if it's hard to explain.

67
00:04:13,910 --> 00:04:16,390
It's because my mind went blank.

68
00:04:19,230 --> 00:04:21,910
The prepared material...

69
00:04:21,910 --> 00:04:25,440
Maybe it should've been something other than the perfect score strategy.

70
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:28,290
That's what I thought at first.

71
00:04:29,150 --> 00:04:31,770
I somehow ended up standing in front of the blackboard,

72
00:04:31,770 --> 00:04:36,470
and I completely forgot what I had prepared with you at that moment.

73
00:04:36,470 --> 00:04:41,640
The perfect score strategy, stuff like score-improving tips, and everything.

74
00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:45,360
So, I thought I should enjoy the piece together.

75
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:47,700
It reminded me of the first class I taught you.

76
00:04:47,700 --> 00:04:50,400
I think it felt similar to that.

77
00:04:51,590 --> 00:04:54,560
Of course, Si Wu isn't as stupid as you were.

78
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:56,720
Geez.

79
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:58,660
I wasn't stupid.

80
00:04:58,660 --> 00:05:01,760
I was a genius who differed from others from the beginning.

81
00:05:03,090 --> 00:05:09,130
The academy will give me a disadvantage somehow.

82
00:05:09,130 --> 00:05:11,190
You should keep a distance from me for now.

83
00:05:11,190 --> 00:05:14,300
It's okay if it looks like we had a falling out because of today.

84
00:05:14,300 --> 00:05:16,430
Don't come to work tomorrow.

85
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:20,500
What if I don't want to do that?

86
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:21,740
Huh?

87
00:05:21,740 --> 00:05:25,150
"I'll take care of the rest. You go forward."

88
00:05:25,150 --> 00:05:28,580
It seems you want to say something cool like that.

89
00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:31,610
But you can't.

90
00:05:31,610 --> 00:05:33,490
I'm okay.

91
00:05:33,490 --> 00:05:37,170
I've experienced it even though it was long ago.

92
00:05:37,170 --> 00:05:40,150
The academy can't readily bug me about it either.

93
00:05:40,150 --> 00:05:46,540
To make more money quicker than the section chief, deputy, and team leader above me,

94
00:05:46,540 --> 00:05:48,800
I quit my corporate job and came here.

95
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:53,470
I wouldn't have come here if I was going to hide behind my boss to save myself.

96
00:05:54,440 --> 00:06:01,180
You and I prepared this project together as teachers and we'll take equal responsibility. And...

97
00:06:02,330 --> 00:06:06,680
well, I got what I wanted.

98
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:10,470
Yes, the man in power seemed angry.

99
00:06:11,660 --> 00:06:13,410
Gosh.

100
00:06:13,410 --> 00:06:16,690
It's a pity everyone knows we failed,

101
00:06:17,850 --> 00:06:21,610
but I'm satisfied my debut was noisy.

102
00:06:21,610 --> 00:06:25,530
There are two exams each semester. We'll continue to get chances.

103
00:06:26,490 --> 00:06:29,680
Just hold onto Chanyeong High tightly.

104
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:32,880
I'll bring us Huiwon High.

105
00:06:37,110 --> 00:06:41,050
 YG Science Academy 

106
00:06:41,050 --> 00:06:45,820
 Huiwon High School 

107
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:52,070
 Good morning. 

108
00:06:52,760 --> 00:06:56,040
 Final Exam Briefing - Chanyeong High 10th Grade 

109
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:57,890
 I set aside the supplementary academy class material for you. 

110
00:06:57,890 --> 00:06:59,820
 Pick it up this evening. 

111
00:06:59,820 --> 00:07:02,120
 Tell me about yesterday, too. 

112
00:07:06,860 --> 00:07:10,410
Everyone who signed up for the briefing came. It's a full house.

113
00:07:10,410 --> 00:07:15,980
Switch the presentation to the one on the USB stick on the laptop.

114
00:07:15,980 --> 00:07:18,460
I displayed the file you checked last.

115
00:07:18,460 --> 00:07:20,390
I checked multiple times.

116
00:07:20,390 --> 00:07:23,770
You said Seo Hye Jin and Lee Jun Ho gave a lecture to Si Wu.

117
00:07:23,770 --> 00:07:26,570
My teaching method was too conventional.

118
00:07:26,570 --> 00:07:28,090
So I prepared something.

119
00:07:28,090 --> 00:07:31,210
 Final Exam Briefing - Chanyeong High 10th Grade 

120
00:07:31,210 --> 00:07:35,310
 Daechi Choeseon Korean Briefing for Parents 

121
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:52,530
 Chanyeong High 10th Grade 2nd Semester 
 Description of Final Exam 

122
00:07:59,320 --> 00:08:02,430
I'm Director Choi Hyeong Seon of Choeseon Korean.

123
00:08:02,430 --> 00:08:06,290
It's nice to meet the Chanyeong High parents for the first time.

124
00:08:10,290 --> 00:08:11,650
I'll get started immediately.

125
00:08:11,650 --> 00:08:13,690
 'I'm excited!' 

126
00:08:15,070 --> 00:08:17,370
You must all remember.

127
00:08:17,370 --> 00:08:22,400
It caused a redo in the last midterm exam.

128
00:08:23,750 --> 00:08:27,490
Let me ask you one thing.

129
00:08:27,490 --> 00:08:31,590
What's the most important exam for the children?

130
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:37,530
The first-semester midterm in the 10th grade when school starts grading?

131
00:08:37,530 --> 00:08:40,550
The 11th-grade exams that the transcripts focus on a lot?

132
00:08:40,550 --> 00:08:43,610
Or the college entrance exam?

133
00:08:44,930 --> 00:08:46,840
They're all wrong.

134
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:48,790
The answer is...

135
00:08:48,790 --> 00:08:50,780
 "This exam" 

136
00:08:51,750 --> 00:08:54,800
The school's exam trend changes every year.

137
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:58,610
Will you panic every time without knowing how to respond

138
00:08:58,610 --> 00:09:01,390
and barge into the school every time?

139
00:09:01,390 --> 00:09:05,450
Complaining to the teachers who are holding the transcripts?

140
00:09:05,450 --> 00:09:07,860
While the offending teacher

141
00:09:07,860 --> 00:09:12,340
causes major chaos by changing the exam rules?

142
00:09:12,990 --> 00:09:15,070
The students

143
00:09:15,070 --> 00:09:20,790
are much weaker than you think.

144
00:09:20,790 --> 00:09:23,240
Just because they're familiar with the old teacher,

145
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:25,080
the schedule is more convenient,

146
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:28,440
they'll want to give up. Don't let that happen.

147
00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:35,130
You need to control them until they get accepted to a college.

148
00:09:38,700 --> 00:09:42,270
The Gray Witch must've started the briefing.

149
00:09:42,270 --> 00:09:46,030
You must be very disappointed about the event yesterday.

150
00:09:46,030 --> 00:09:47,610
I'm sorry.

151
00:09:47,610 --> 00:09:51,480
Not at all. You're the ones who must feel hurt.

152
00:09:53,030 --> 00:09:55,840
It would've been nice if you heard Mr. Lee's lecture.

153
00:09:55,840 --> 00:09:57,600
He's stronger in the actual battles.

154
00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:00,380
You gave a lecture?

155
00:10:00,380 --> 00:10:03,060
Because even one student matters.

156
00:10:04,230 --> 00:10:06,390
Good job.

157
00:10:06,390 --> 00:10:10,890
Hard work like that makes the academy's image.

158
00:10:12,230 --> 00:10:14,660
You're making me feel even worse.

159
00:10:14,660 --> 00:10:18,640
No, no. I thought you might be tormented thinking that.

160
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:20,980
That's why I called you early in the morning.

161
00:10:20,980 --> 00:10:24,220
I thought it'd be better to see you earlier.

162
00:10:24,220 --> 00:10:28,880
We didn't meet the goal with Huiwon High, but Chanyeong High—

163
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:34,720
I noticed something very unexpected in you this time.

164
00:10:35,850 --> 00:10:40,020
Your selfless attitude in training Mr. Lee properly.

165
00:10:40,020 --> 00:10:43,260
A sense of drive with no fear of a counter-attack.

166
00:10:43,260 --> 00:10:47,740
Wow, I didn't know you had that kind of ability.

167
00:10:48,680 --> 00:10:53,950
And on top of that you gave an entire lecture for just one student?

168
00:10:53,950 --> 00:10:55,790
Wow.

169
00:10:55,790 --> 00:11:01,550
What an exemplary attitude that'll inspire newer teachers.

170
00:11:01,550 --> 00:11:04,340
- That's— 
- Team Leader Seo,

171
00:11:04,340 --> 00:11:08,760
you shouldn't be stuck in a small classroom.

172
00:11:10,020 --> 00:11:13,310
Chanyeong High 11th grade?

173
00:11:14,090 --> 00:11:16,360
I thought you'd like it.

174
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:20,030
But I requested 10th grade.

175
00:11:20,030 --> 00:11:24,540
I didn't ask to split Team Leader Seo's class. I wanted to get my own students—

176
00:11:24,540 --> 00:11:27,680
So you don't want it?

177
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:30,480
Well, more than not wanting to—

178
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:34,170
How many 11th-grade Chanyeong High students do we currently have?

179
00:11:34,170 --> 00:11:36,900
A little more than 80.

180
00:11:36,900 --> 00:11:38,840
- I don't know the exact number— 
- I see.

181
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:43,080
You'll have about 40 students if you split a class with Mr. Lee.

182
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:45,370
Mr. Lee, too?

183
00:11:45,370 --> 00:11:49,140
Why? Do you want all 80 students?

184
00:11:49,140 --> 00:11:51,520
No, it's not that.

185
00:11:51,520 --> 00:11:55,850
Or are you disappointed since they'll be in 12th grade soon?

186
00:11:55,850 --> 00:11:58,380
Since they'll be leaving soon?

187
00:12:00,900 --> 00:12:03,120
No.

188
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:07,590
I think it's a good thing. The new teachers rarely get to teach 12th grade.

189
00:12:07,590 --> 00:12:13,240
Not everyone gets to start in Daechi-dong

190
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:15,490
with an opportunity like this.

191
00:12:15,490 --> 00:12:18,900
Yes. Of course, I know that.

192
00:12:18,900 --> 00:12:24,200
Please feel pressured that the academy is highly looking forward to you two.

193
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:25,650
Okay.

194
00:12:27,970 --> 00:12:31,070
Team Leader Seo will help you a lot.

195
00:12:32,070 --> 00:12:37,170
I never stopped thinking the Korean department is

196
00:12:37,170 --> 00:12:41,070
the core of our academy.

197
00:12:41,070 --> 00:12:42,950
We have more departments now

198
00:12:42,950 --> 00:12:46,780
since we took over Assistant Director Wu Seung Hui's Victory Academy.

199
00:12:46,780 --> 00:12:50,660
But I always thought the Korean department

200
00:12:50,660 --> 00:12:53,400
would maintain the tradition of our academy.

201
00:12:54,150 --> 00:12:58,300
Thinking now, I put a lot of effort into the Korean department.

202
00:12:58,300 --> 00:13:01,030
Starting with advertising,

203
00:13:01,030 --> 00:13:03,390
I've always been supportive of the Korean teachers.

204
00:13:03,390 --> 00:13:07,460
Thanks to that, Ms. Seo settled down at a young age, too.

205
00:13:07,460 --> 00:13:09,110
I'm grateful for that.

206
00:13:09,110 --> 00:13:10,810
Yes.

207
00:13:10,810 --> 00:13:13,310
But I always try

208
00:13:13,310 --> 00:13:17,920
to be objective and critical.

209
00:13:19,260 --> 00:13:21,080
"Am I

210
00:13:21,080 --> 00:13:25,490
a proper leader as the director of the academy?

211
00:13:26,290 --> 00:13:29,090
Am I getting lazy

212
00:13:29,090 --> 00:13:32,870
by wanting to make a steady profit?"

213
00:13:37,050 --> 00:13:39,970
After criticizing myself harshly,

214
00:13:39,970 --> 00:13:43,400
I reached a conclusion.

215
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:46,810
Now is the time for growth in quality,

216
00:13:46,810 --> 00:13:50,440
not quantity.

217
00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:52,080
And one more thing.

218
00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:57,430
I've been forgetting that Team Leader Seo is key to that growth.

219
00:13:57,430 --> 00:13:59,790
I've been reflecting on that.

220
00:14:00,590 --> 00:14:02,000
That means...

221
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,530
Since you're a top-class lecturer,

222
00:14:04,530 --> 00:14:07,350
you need to broaden your horizons now.

223
00:14:08,070 --> 00:14:11,280
Ms. Seo, take it easy and work for

224
00:14:11,280 --> 00:14:14,520
the Gangbuk branch opening task force.

225
00:14:43,310 --> 00:14:45,820
Do you understand this situation?

226
00:14:45,820 --> 00:14:47,440
No.

227
00:15:04,220 --> 00:15:08,010
What did he mean? What task force all of a sudden?

228
00:15:08,740 --> 00:15:12,320
There's no such thing. There's no team, either.

229
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:15,950
The Assistant Director will want to see you soon. Let me keep it brief.

230
00:15:15,950 --> 00:15:17,860
Why would she want to see me?

231
00:15:17,860 --> 00:15:21,560
She'll give you part of my class.

232
00:15:21,560 --> 00:15:24,980
I think it'll be Chanyeong High—probably 11th grade.

233
00:15:24,980 --> 00:15:26,160
What do you mean—

234
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:30,340
Since we don't know how many of the 10th-grade Choeseon Korean will take.

235
00:15:30,340 --> 00:15:32,520
I know, but why would I be taking your students?

236
00:15:32,520 --> 00:15:35,680
To make me leave empty-handed.

237
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:38,160
Just because that one free lecture failed?

238
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:42,750
No, they've probably been looking for a chance.

239
00:15:42,750 --> 00:15:47,010
A lecturer like me is a double-edged sword for an academy.

240
00:15:47,010 --> 00:15:48,680
I make them a good profit,

241
00:15:48,680 --> 00:15:52,610
but the academy would suffer a lot if I left with my students.

242
00:15:52,610 --> 00:15:57,160
That's why they've been trying to split up my students.

243
00:15:58,140 --> 00:16:01,180
"Demotions often get presented as an honor."

244
00:16:03,230 --> 00:16:05,460
I like how quickly you understand.

245
00:16:06,750 --> 00:16:10,200
So, that means you're...

246
00:16:12,370 --> 00:16:14,910
You're screwed because of me, right?

247
00:16:18,680 --> 00:16:20,300
Excuse me.

248
00:16:20,300 --> 00:16:22,340
 Assistant Director Wu Seung Hui 

249
00:16:23,070 --> 00:16:24,650
Answer it.

250
00:16:49,740 --> 00:16:53,240
You said you just hung out after the academy class on the weekend.

251
00:16:53,240 --> 00:16:56,540
We did. After finishing the homework.

252
00:16:56,540 --> 00:16:58,470
You traitors.

253
00:17:00,940 --> 00:17:03,020
I'm so busy. Who is it?

254
00:17:03,020 --> 00:17:04,600
"Mom."

255
00:17:07,030 --> 00:17:09,410
Hey, Mom.

256
00:17:09,410 --> 00:17:13,070
It's break time, of course. Isn't that why you called?

257
00:17:15,270 --> 00:17:17,070
Yes.

258
00:17:17,070 --> 00:17:19,440
Was the briefing fun?

259
00:17:21,370 --> 00:17:22,770
What?

260
00:17:23,980 --> 00:17:26,280
Don't do that, Mom.

261
00:17:26,280 --> 00:17:28,760
Don't do that field study thing.

262
00:17:28,760 --> 00:17:30,280
What?

263
00:17:31,230 --> 00:17:34,330
I mean...

264
00:17:34,330 --> 00:17:37,710
I like Ms. Han Jin's class.

265
00:17:40,580 --> 00:17:43,070
What do you know?

266
00:17:45,580 --> 00:17:47,720
Well...

267
00:17:47,720 --> 00:17:51,530
we need to start preparing for the finals.

268
00:17:51,530 --> 00:17:53,050
Yes.

269
00:17:54,420 --> 00:18:00,060
I heard you told the students that it'll be based solely on the textbook.

270
00:18:00,060 --> 00:18:01,580
Yes.

271
00:18:03,220 --> 00:18:06,920
Is there a problem with that?

272
00:18:10,070 --> 00:18:14,010
To be realistic, it might be difficult.

273
00:18:15,230 --> 00:18:16,980
Difficult?

274
00:18:16,980 --> 00:18:21,800
You know. It's hard to assess the students' abilities that way.

275
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:26,650
I agree. The students are too high level.

276
00:18:26,650 --> 00:18:31,540
In the end, we'll have to dock points based on wrong punctuation in essay questions.

277
00:18:33,690 --> 00:18:36,670
Grading will be such a disaster.

278
00:18:38,920 --> 00:18:41,460
I hope you understand our situation.

279
00:18:41,460 --> 00:18:44,420
The teachers' performance assessment starts soon, too.

280
00:18:45,080 --> 00:18:46,550
Please?

281
00:18:48,210 --> 00:18:52,420
I'm trying to come up with a solution.

282
00:18:52,420 --> 00:18:57,230
You can't come up with the exam questions from the after-school class, either,

283
00:18:57,230 --> 00:19:00,170
because not all the students take it.

284
00:19:01,700 --> 00:19:04,220
Ultimately

285
00:19:04,220 --> 00:19:07,290
teachers like us will suffer the consequences.

286
00:19:07,960 --> 00:19:09,430
Please?

287
00:19:21,420 --> 00:19:25,950
What are you, an amateur? You believe everything the academy says?

288
00:19:25,950 --> 00:19:29,750
What do you mean by "feeling excited?"

289
00:19:37,130 --> 00:19:40,790
I believe the two of you can make the transition smooth.

290
00:19:40,790 --> 00:19:45,610
Let me know if you need more material. Let me explain the notebook first.

291
00:19:48,010 --> 00:19:50,360
This isn't the situation I planned.

292
00:19:50,360 --> 00:19:52,250
I know.

293
00:19:54,070 --> 00:19:55,700
Ms. Seo.

294
00:19:55,700 --> 00:19:57,220
Yes.

295
00:19:57,220 --> 00:20:01,880
Killing a popular teacher so they can't leave with their students

296
00:20:01,880 --> 00:20:06,000
happens in academies all the time. I know that well.

297
00:20:08,050 --> 00:20:11,050
But shouldn't you complain or something?

298
00:20:11,930 --> 00:20:15,300
I'm not dead yet.

299
00:20:16,550 --> 00:20:18,140
I mean...

300
00:20:18,870 --> 00:20:22,510
It's not like they gave me 10th-graders. I know Mr. Pyo, too.

301
00:20:22,510 --> 00:20:24,000
We can defend ourselves from Choeseon, too.

302
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:28,960
That's why they didn't give you 10th-graders. So, you two can stay safe.

303
00:20:29,810 --> 00:20:32,980
I have a question for you, Ms. Nam.

304
00:20:32,980 --> 00:20:34,840
Go ahead and ask.

305
00:20:34,840 --> 00:20:37,400
The 10th-grade teacher, Mr. Pyo.

306
00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:40,710
Can he cover the entire year's material?

307
00:20:40,710 --> 00:20:45,550
Including a whole year's study material for the finals?

308
00:20:45,550 --> 00:20:50,490
I think he'll cover a larger range to create differences for grading purposes.

309
00:20:51,870 --> 00:20:53,700
I'll fill in the gaps.

310
00:20:53,700 --> 00:20:57,360
The academy wants me to leave with nothing, but I won't allow it.

311
00:20:57,360 --> 00:21:02,500
Hold on. I think it happened two years ago at Guksa Polytechnic High. I'll go get the file.

312
00:21:10,550 --> 00:21:13,420
Don't look at me like that. I won't go down so easily.

313
00:21:14,990 --> 00:21:19,080
Should I meet with Si Wu? He wrote down his phone number yesterday. I'll meet him and—

314
00:21:19,080 --> 00:21:22,500
Don't do stuff like that. It will have the opposite effect.

315
00:21:24,310 --> 00:21:26,860
Okay, here.

316
00:21:29,180 --> 00:21:31,090
I'm sorry.

317
00:21:31,090 --> 00:21:35,450
I didn't know the director would suddenly schedule a supplementary class.

318
00:21:35,450 --> 00:21:39,180
I made you fall behind for nothing, didn't I?

319
00:21:41,620 --> 00:21:43,270
It's okay.

320
00:21:43,270 --> 00:21:45,610
The class yesterday was interesting, too.

321
00:21:46,210 --> 00:21:49,390
It was interesting?

322
00:21:49,390 --> 00:21:50,790
Yes.

323
00:21:54,130 --> 00:21:56,370
Since you wanted it as a reference,

324
00:21:56,990 --> 00:22:00,220
I took notes on the handout.

325
00:22:00,220 --> 00:22:02,180
This is a copy of it.

326
00:22:14,150 --> 00:22:16,350
Tell me in detail.

327
00:22:17,210 --> 00:22:22,410
Looks like they made it more personalized since it was just one student.

328
00:22:22,410 --> 00:22:27,360
They especially veered off from the material in the modern literature part.

329
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:30,170
Don't you think he will switch academy?

330
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:33,470
How could he consider that?

331
00:22:43,470 --> 00:22:47,920
 Take your time as if you're making friends. 

332
00:22:47,920 --> 00:22:52,840
 The world beyond the text is bigger. Developing vocabulary requires imagination. 

333
00:23:23,290 --> 00:23:26,190
 The call is not going through. You'll be connected to the voicemail... 

334
00:23:37,950 --> 00:23:39,710
 The call is not going through. 

335
00:23:39,710 --> 00:23:42,340
By chance... No...

336
00:23:42,340 --> 00:23:45,460
The class. Si Wu ...

337
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:05,910
Si Wu!

338
00:24:05,910 --> 00:24:08,190
Lee Si Wu!

339
00:24:14,260 --> 00:24:16,750
Why...

340
00:24:17,620 --> 00:24:19,850
Why didn't you answer your phone?

341
00:24:21,400 --> 00:24:23,560
I put it on mute.

342
00:24:23,560 --> 00:24:26,000
I did that while I was talking to you.

343
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:27,750
That's fine.

344
00:24:28,440 --> 00:24:30,830
You'll have to come with me.

345
00:24:33,790 --> 00:24:36,260
I need to go to the math academy.

346
00:24:36,260 --> 00:24:37,780
I haven't eaten, either.

347
00:24:37,780 --> 00:24:39,860
It will just take a moment.

348
00:24:45,100 --> 00:24:47,050
Do me a favor.

349
00:24:47,050 --> 00:24:48,600
Please?

350
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:56,440
I'm sorry. You need to go to the academy.

351
00:24:57,650 --> 00:24:59,410
It's okay.

352
00:24:59,410 --> 00:25:01,100
How's school?

353
00:25:01,100 --> 00:25:04,420
Is it worth the long-distance commuting?

354
00:25:05,770 --> 00:25:08,600
Yes, it's all good.

355
00:25:09,950 --> 00:25:14,300
I should cut to the chase, right?

356
00:25:14,300 --> 00:25:19,230
I wanted to ask you how the other class went.

357
00:25:23,910 --> 00:25:29,930
The TA said you didn't know about this.

358
00:25:34,340 --> 00:25:36,190
I heard you found the class interesting.

359
00:25:36,190 --> 00:25:38,760
Which part did you like?

360
00:25:38,760 --> 00:25:41,200
Just this and that.

361
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:43,410
You can talk to me freely.

362
00:25:47,430 --> 00:25:50,420
The exam analysis was thorough...

363
00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:56,070
and it looked like they prepared the essay question strategies well, too.

364
00:25:56,770 --> 00:26:00,070
They supplied the other schools' exam questions, too.

365
00:26:00,970 --> 00:26:04,070
You can see that from the handout itself.

366
00:26:04,940 --> 00:26:10,750
Shouldn't I learn from other teachers and improve myself?

367
00:26:10,750 --> 00:26:14,170
That'd be a good thing for you, too.

368
00:26:20,680 --> 00:26:24,940
I found this note interesting.

369
00:26:29,280 --> 00:26:31,600
"Take your time as if you're making friends.

370
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:34,490
The world beyond the text is bigger.

371
00:26:34,490 --> 00:26:37,590
Developing vocabulary requires imagination."

372
00:26:37,590 --> 00:26:39,500
What's all this?

373
00:26:40,450 --> 00:26:42,710
It's nothing.

374
00:26:42,710 --> 00:26:45,880
I want to hear what you were thinking.

375
00:26:50,140 --> 00:26:52,280
To be honest,

376
00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:55,850
Korean isn't my favorite subject.

377
00:26:55,850 --> 00:26:57,180
Is that so?

378
00:26:57,180 --> 00:27:00,410
Your grades are very consistent despite that.

379
00:27:00,410 --> 00:27:02,400
So...

380
00:27:02,980 --> 00:27:08,640
grammar isn't hard because there's a formula.

381
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:10,780
But...

382
00:27:10,780 --> 00:27:12,750
I don't get literature.

383
00:27:12,750 --> 00:27:15,040
So, I just memorize things.

384
00:27:16,300 --> 00:27:19,110
But I always felt anxious

385
00:27:19,110 --> 00:27:22,940
because some kids are good in Korean because they like it.

386
00:27:22,940 --> 00:27:25,640
It'd be hard to beat them.

387
00:27:26,910 --> 00:27:29,460
And the first page of the textbook says...

388
00:27:29,460 --> 00:27:34,210
the goal of studying Korean is to live as a human.

389
00:27:35,480 --> 00:27:40,410
But reading doesn't make me feel more of a human.

390
00:27:42,050 --> 00:27:44,760
I don't know what it means to be a human, either.

391
00:27:47,490 --> 00:27:49,100
Anyway,

392
00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:51,850
I didn't like Korean...

393
00:27:52,550 --> 00:27:56,530
because it felt like an impractical subject.

394
00:28:00,100 --> 00:28:02,620
But after taking the class yesterday,

395
00:28:02,620 --> 00:28:06,220
I could understand why I disliked Korean.

396
00:28:07,370 --> 00:28:12,080
It was kind of like when I first entered the classroom

397
00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:15,460
on the first day of school and

398
00:28:15,460 --> 00:28:19,720
worried about who I'd eat lunch with later.

399
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:30,460
So, what I mean is...

400
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:34,140
I don't know the author who wrote the piece

401
00:28:34,140 --> 00:28:37,880
and I don't know the protagonist, either,

402
00:28:37,880 --> 00:28:40,440
but I have to eat with them.

403
00:28:41,050 --> 00:28:48,130
I need to assess their thoughts and positions quickly.

404
00:28:48,130 --> 00:28:50,530
That's what I found difficult.

405
00:28:51,750 --> 00:28:54,740
So, I get flustered when I encounter unfamiliar text

406
00:28:54,740 --> 00:28:57,680
and I used to rely on my instinct, but...

407
00:29:00,500 --> 00:29:06,600
taking time to approach them was fun for the first time.

408
00:29:07,930 --> 00:29:12,100
It didn't exactly make me feel more human,

409
00:29:13,190 --> 00:29:17,500
but it made me want to write

410
00:29:17,500 --> 00:29:20,360
literature reviews, too.

411
00:29:22,680 --> 00:29:27,610
I'm sorry. I'm not so good at talking.

412
00:29:32,150 --> 00:29:35,340
I thought you were aiming for medical school.

413
00:29:37,690 --> 00:29:39,300
I haven't decided yet.

414
00:29:39,300 --> 00:29:42,050
Your parents must want that.

415
00:29:42,050 --> 00:29:45,800
It's probably worth a shot for you for early admissions.

416
00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:49,200
It might be, but—

417
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:51,640
Then, you should write an essay that's advantageous for your summary statement.

418
00:29:51,640 --> 00:29:55,060
Why do you try to study something useless?

419
00:30:00,100 --> 00:30:04,920
That's what I think is a shame with you.

420
00:30:04,920 --> 00:30:07,310
You're very intelligent, but

421
00:30:08,020 --> 00:30:13,300
compared to the kids who went to elementary and middle school here,

422
00:30:14,460 --> 00:30:20,260
you have fewer experts to give you good advice.

423
00:30:20,260 --> 00:30:23,630
You lack guidance from adults, maybe.

424
00:30:25,650 --> 00:30:28,790
Meet with a college application consultant. He's an expert.

425
00:30:28,790 --> 00:30:31,210
I'll make you an appointment with someone I know well.

426
00:30:31,210 --> 00:30:32,770
No.

427
00:30:35,270 --> 00:30:37,030
It's okay.

428
00:30:37,030 --> 00:30:39,000
You don't have to feel pressured.

429
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:41,510
It's my treat since I'm grateful for what you told me today.

430
00:30:41,510 --> 00:30:43,770
It's really okay.

431
00:30:46,060 --> 00:30:47,880
I'm thinking of...

432
00:30:50,050 --> 00:30:52,270
switching academies.

433
00:31:03,030 --> 00:31:05,100
I'm sad.

434
00:31:08,580 --> 00:31:12,230
Did you tell other students, too?

435
00:31:18,910 --> 00:31:21,350
So freaking scary.

436
00:31:21,350 --> 00:31:26,900
 Director's office 

437
00:31:37,570 --> 00:31:39,020
- Mr. Park. 
 - Yes!

438
00:31:39,020 --> 00:31:41,500
Y-Yes.

439
00:31:43,590 --> 00:31:44,710
Did you call me?

440
00:31:44,710 --> 00:31:48,790
What are Ms. Seo's free days?

441
00:31:53,650 --> 00:31:56,210
Mondays.

442
00:31:56,210 --> 00:31:58,180
It's today.

443
00:32:02,510 --> 00:32:04,960
Let's grab dinner. My treat.

444
00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:06,860
Yes, let's go.

445
00:32:10,600 --> 00:32:12,960
Excuse me.

446
00:32:19,160 --> 00:32:22,130
I wonder if we should treat her.

447
00:32:26,380 --> 00:32:28,780
Director Choi.

448
00:32:28,780 --> 00:32:34,040
I'm sorry for calling you while you were resting after the event yesterday.

449
00:32:34,990 --> 00:32:37,690
Is that so? That's great.

450
00:32:37,690 --> 00:32:41,520
I'd like to see you sometime at my academy.

451
00:32:43,650 --> 00:32:47,490
That's true. Many people would see us.

452
00:32:49,550 --> 00:32:54,710
I'll be waiting until Daechi-dong becomes less crowded.

453
00:32:57,490 --> 00:33:00,850
I'm sorry. You should eat without me.

454
00:33:00,850 --> 00:33:02,440
- Pardon?
 - Pardon?

455
00:33:02,440 --> 00:33:03,750
Where are you going?

456
00:33:03,750 --> 00:33:05,950
I have to meet someone urgently.

457
00:33:22,730 --> 00:33:25,670
Hey, are you done?

458
00:33:25,670 --> 00:33:29,500
I'll be right there. See you soon.

459
00:33:29,500 --> 00:33:31,160
I'll leave now.

 Daechi Choeseon Korean 

488
00:35:58,730 --> 00:36:00,760
♫  'Cause you got the wit  ♫

489
00:36:00,760 --> 00:36:03,880
♫   and you got the drive  ♫

490
00:36:12,850 --> 00:36:14,930
♫  'Cause you got the wit  ♫

491
00:36:14,930 --> 00:36:16,580
♫  and you got the drive  ♫

492
00:36:16,580 --> 00:36:21,950
♫  You hold the whole world between your eyes  ♫

493
00:36:21,950 --> 00:36:26,030
♫  Oh, it's so easy to see  ♫

494
00:36:26,030 --> 00:36:28,250
 Master of Korean 
 Daechi-dong Choeseon Korean 

495
00:37:07,990 --> 00:37:10,180
 Daechi Choeseon Korean 

496
00:37:34,220 --> 00:37:36,540
Yes, come on in.

497
00:37:43,250 --> 00:37:45,680
Welcome, Ms. Seo.

498
00:37:45,680 --> 00:37:48,780
Nice to meet you, Director Choi.

499
00:37:48,780 --> 00:37:51,150
You can leave, Mr. Park.

500
00:37:53,180 --> 00:37:54,930
Pardon?

501
00:37:54,930 --> 00:37:58,290
You can go home. This might take a long time.

502
00:38:09,040 --> 00:38:12,260
I assume yesterday was difficult.

503
00:38:12,260 --> 00:38:15,030
I had a meaningful time

504
00:38:15,030 --> 00:38:16,790
thanks to you.

505
00:38:17,650 --> 00:38:23,690
Huiwon High students are smart, but they lack a lot from the teachers' perspective.

506
00:38:23,690 --> 00:38:25,730
Since the exam is coming up soon, too,

507
00:38:25,730 --> 00:38:28,210
I've been noticing a lot of weaknesses.

508
00:38:28,210 --> 00:38:30,160
I understand.

509
00:38:30,160 --> 00:38:33,980
I hope you understand an old woman's worries.

510
00:38:33,980 --> 00:38:36,830
What did you want to talk about?

511
00:38:37,840 --> 00:38:40,370
Would you like to get up for a moment?

512
00:38:40,370 --> 00:38:42,890
I want to show you something.

513
00:38:56,170 --> 00:39:00,580
I've wanted to become a teacher ever since middle school.

514
00:39:00,580 --> 00:39:05,230
My 7th-grade homeroom teacher was admirable.

515
00:39:06,610 --> 00:39:10,040
That's why I studied very hard,

516
00:39:10,040 --> 00:39:13,210
and I was very good at it, too.

517
00:39:13,210 --> 00:39:16,700
What was your dream, Ms. Seo?

518
00:39:18,050 --> 00:39:20,260
I went to law school.

519
00:39:20,260 --> 00:39:22,000
I know that much.

520
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:24,970
I'm asking what your dream was.

521
00:39:28,070 --> 00:39:30,300
I don't remember.

522
00:39:30,300 --> 00:39:34,550
I studied at Seoul University's Korean education department.

523
00:39:34,550 --> 00:39:37,380
I passed the teaching certification exam easily,

524
00:39:37,380 --> 00:39:39,750
and I became a teacher at the age of 24.

525
00:39:39,750 --> 00:39:44,470
I was happy to work at the school until I was 40.

526
00:39:45,270 --> 00:39:49,920
Should I underline the "40" part or the "school" part?

527
00:39:51,520 --> 00:39:55,990
Excellent students ask good questions rather than answering questions well.

528
00:39:55,990 --> 00:39:58,450
Underline the school part.

529
00:39:58,450 --> 00:40:03,070
What I wanted wasn't just to be behind the podium.

530
00:40:03,070 --> 00:40:08,610
What I wanted was an overwhelming power and respect.

531
00:40:10,160 --> 00:40:12,670
You probably wouldn't know, but

532
00:40:12,670 --> 00:40:17,910
the teachers were very powerful in my day.

533
00:40:18,720 --> 00:40:22,280
I guess that's what I wanted.

534
00:40:22,280 --> 00:40:29,170
But it turns out the school wasn't for that as time passed by.

535
00:40:29,170 --> 00:40:33,600
I decided to send as many students to college as possible

536
00:40:33,600 --> 00:40:36,930
and be treated as the best because of that.

537
00:40:38,340 --> 00:40:42,440
That's why I've never worked for anyone since I quit working for school.

538
00:40:42,440 --> 00:40:45,750
I jumped into the tutoring market immediately,

539
00:40:45,750 --> 00:40:49,300
I opened a study club in half a year,

540
00:40:49,300 --> 00:40:53,060
and it only took me a year to turn that into an academy.

541
00:40:55,440 --> 00:40:58,400
Did you ask me to come to tell me your personal history?

542
00:40:58,400 --> 00:41:03,210
I made the academy grow this much without anyone's help.

543
00:41:03,210 --> 00:41:06,740
We moved to this building...

544
00:41:07,370 --> 00:41:09,580
about six years ago.

545
00:41:10,590 --> 00:41:15,220
We created an international school classroom in a different building since we ran out of space.

546
00:41:15,220 --> 00:41:17,740
We started a second location in Banpo, too.

547
00:41:17,740 --> 00:41:22,130
You said you don't have enough classrooms. Why is this—

548
00:41:24,390 --> 00:41:26,730
This is the assistant director's office.

549
00:41:28,070 --> 00:41:30,650
I achieved most of the things I wanted,

550
00:41:30,650 --> 00:41:34,590
but I haven't found the owner of this office yet.

551
00:41:36,130 --> 00:41:38,780
The owner of the office I've been looking for years

552
00:41:38,780 --> 00:41:42,070
is right here with me today.

553
00:41:46,010 --> 00:41:48,710
I knew you wouldn't be surprised.

554
00:41:54,130 --> 00:42:00,760
Do you think Ms. Seo could really gather more Chanyeong students than now?

555
00:42:02,860 --> 00:42:04,670
I'm sure she can.

556
00:42:05,570 --> 00:42:10,080
Eighty students are enough to start your own academy.

557
00:42:10,080 --> 00:42:12,600
It'd be a miracle if she achieved that.

558
00:42:13,400 --> 00:42:15,560
That's her specialty.

559
00:42:22,080 --> 00:42:25,730
Why is it just the two of you?

560
00:42:25,730 --> 00:42:28,600
Ms. Seo said she had business somewhere.

561
00:42:28,600 --> 00:42:31,050
What's this about?

562
00:42:31,050 --> 00:42:34,750
Our team is having a team dinner. I wondered if you could join us.

563
00:42:34,750 --> 00:42:37,640
I want to come. Come with us.

564
00:42:38,470 --> 00:42:40,940
Well, next time.

565
00:42:40,940 --> 00:42:42,850
You go ahead.

566
00:42:45,680 --> 00:42:48,400
- You could eat more?
 - Yes, sounds good.

567
00:42:50,850 --> 00:42:54,000
 Lecture skills, textbook quality, and student management skills. 

568
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:58,330
A lot of people meet that criteria.

569
00:42:58,330 --> 00:43:04,040
What I'm looking for is planning ability and boldness.

570
00:43:05,470 --> 00:43:07,450
Just one moment.

571
00:43:19,040 --> 00:43:23,610
This is the first flyer I made after I quit working at school.

572
00:43:24,620 --> 00:43:29,380
The design is shabby, but the copy claimed a lot of attention.

573
00:43:29,380 --> 00:43:32,750
I said I taught everything, including Huiwon High's

574
00:43:32,750 --> 00:43:36,620
Korean exam trends and patterns.

575
00:43:37,410 --> 00:43:41,320
I got harassed so much after I passed out that flyer.

576
00:43:41,320 --> 00:43:46,110
Huiwon High's Korean teachers made a huge uproar.

577
00:43:49,190 --> 00:43:53,460
We share similarities.

578
00:43:53,460 --> 00:43:55,890
And I like that.

579
00:43:58,780 --> 00:44:01,640
Did you sign a contract for next year?

580
00:44:01,640 --> 00:44:04,220
No, not yet.

581
00:44:05,470 --> 00:44:08,280
Why don't you sign one with me instead?

582
00:44:09,800 --> 00:44:14,580
How much of the academy's profit do you take now?

583
00:44:14,580 --> 00:44:16,660
I don't think I can tell you that.

584
00:44:16,660 --> 00:44:18,370
It's probably confidential information.

585
00:44:18,370 --> 00:44:20,460
Tell me the ratio you want, then.

586
00:44:20,460 --> 00:44:22,750
I can try to match it.

587
00:44:23,610 --> 00:44:27,460
Consulting parents, managing students and documents.

588
00:44:27,460 --> 00:44:29,960
I won't let you do small tasks like that.

589
00:44:29,960 --> 00:44:33,000
I'll get you a great TA.

590
00:44:33,930 --> 00:44:35,950
Please give good lectures

591
00:44:35,950 --> 00:44:39,030
and help the expansion of the academy.

592
00:44:40,330 --> 00:44:43,950
You might be overestimating me.

593
00:44:45,970 --> 00:44:53,190
I'm in the twilight years of my life without a husband or a child.

594
00:44:53,990 --> 00:44:57,870
As the founder, I want to maintain a stable income,

595
00:44:57,870 --> 00:45:03,250
overwhelming respect, and retire impressively.

596
00:45:04,020 --> 00:45:07,690
To do that, someone farsighted needs to

597
00:45:07,690 --> 00:45:12,700
let this academy grow and take it over.

598
00:45:16,170 --> 00:45:22,470
If you and the Chanyeong High students join Choeseon Korean,

599
00:45:22,470 --> 00:45:28,440
we'll become a powerful Korean academy that's just as good as major ones.

600
00:45:33,750 --> 00:45:35,600
I'm sorry.

601
00:45:36,400 --> 00:45:38,110
What's so funny?

602
00:45:38,110 --> 00:45:40,160
It's not funny.

603
00:45:40,160 --> 00:45:43,410
It just came out because I was relieved.

604
00:45:45,840 --> 00:45:48,390
I guess Si Wu is making a move.

605
00:45:49,640 --> 00:45:52,750
With his friends, even.

606
00:46:32,220 --> 00:46:35,940
I feel like Lee Si Wu will come.

607
00:46:44,130 --> 00:46:50,720
We're not at risk of losing our reputation for having the No. 1 attendance rate with Huiwon High for 20 years.

608
00:46:50,720 --> 00:46:55,740
Aren't you making this offer since you think it'd hurt you in the long run?

609
00:46:55,740 --> 00:46:57,350
Including the current pre-learning class.

610
00:46:57,350 --> 00:47:03,530
If there's a fee for breaking the current contract, I'll pay for that, too.

611
00:47:06,020 --> 00:47:07,650
Director.

612
00:47:08,450 --> 00:47:12,880
I appreciate the generous offer. I mean it.

613
00:47:12,880 --> 00:47:16,000
Do you want the contract information, then?

614
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:19,060
But there's something I want to correct you on.

615
00:47:20,970 --> 00:47:25,410
The planning ability and boldness. I'm not the only one who has that.

616
00:47:25,410 --> 00:47:28,200
Oh, yes.

617
00:47:28,200 --> 00:47:31,960
You do have a student you raised well.

618
00:47:31,960 --> 00:47:40,450
But the person I want is you. The one with the highest number of Chanyeong students.

619
00:47:46,590 --> 00:47:49,990
It's okay if I think about it, right?

620
00:47:49,990 --> 00:47:51,920
Of course.

621
00:48:12,170 --> 00:48:14,050
 Where are you? 

622
00:48:35,630 --> 00:48:37,460
Where have you been?

623
00:48:37,460 --> 00:48:38,890
Why did you come back?

624
00:48:38,890 --> 00:48:41,680
I came to pick up the car, but I noticed the lights were on.

625
00:48:41,680 --> 00:48:44,040
I saw your bag and stuff, but I didn't see anyone.

626
00:48:44,040 --> 00:48:45,980
So, I wondered where you were.

627
00:48:45,980 --> 00:48:49,110
Did the director or the assistant director want to see you?

628
00:48:49,110 --> 00:48:50,980
What were they trying to say this time?

629
00:48:50,980 --> 00:48:52,690
You aren't too far off.

630
00:48:52,690 --> 00:48:56,280
Take this first. They're counseling journals.

631
00:48:56,280 --> 00:48:58,470
One is for parents, and the other is for students.

632
00:48:58,470 --> 00:49:01,130
Counseling is an important part of teaching,

633
00:49:01,130 --> 00:49:04,430
but it's been delayed since you had too big a task.

634
00:49:04,430 --> 00:49:05,950
There are frequently asked questions with this, too.

635
00:49:05,950 --> 00:49:08,320
I'll tell you about them starting tomorrow.

636
00:49:08,320 --> 00:49:11,250
I asked you whom you met.

637
00:49:14,650 --> 00:49:16,340
Ms. Seo?

638
00:49:18,110 --> 00:49:20,090
Si Wu will come...

639
00:49:21,230 --> 00:49:23,280
along with his friends.

640
00:49:33,110 --> 00:49:35,540
Wow, what a relief. That's a huge relief.

641
00:49:35,540 --> 00:49:38,130
- We don't know for sure yet.
 - No, we do.

642
00:49:38,130 --> 00:49:41,770
I've been thinking, "He'll come. He'll come."

643
00:49:41,770 --> 00:49:44,140
You've been acting normal, but you were hugely disappointed.

644
00:49:44,140 --> 00:49:47,260
I was just about to call Si Wu.

645
00:49:47,260 --> 00:49:49,760
Wow, seriously.

646
00:49:52,280 --> 00:49:54,240
How did you know, by the way?

647
00:49:56,350 --> 00:49:58,560
It happens a few times a year.

648
00:49:58,560 --> 00:50:03,350
Although this was the most explosive offer.

649
00:50:07,320 --> 00:50:09,530
I haven't decided yet.

650
00:50:12,500 --> 00:50:14,590
May I ask you a question?

651
00:50:15,490 --> 00:50:16,860
What is it?

652
00:50:16,860 --> 00:50:21,890
Because you might not get a Huiwon class if I join Choeseon Korean?

653
00:50:21,890 --> 00:50:25,850
Oh, right. There's that problem.

654
00:50:27,740 --> 00:50:33,430
Did you feel like jumping for joy when she made the offer?

655
00:50:55,400 --> 00:50:58,350
The answer to the question you asked earlier.

656
00:50:58,350 --> 00:51:02,540
To answer that, I didn't feel that happy.

657
00:51:05,290 --> 00:51:10,760
Because I think I at least deserved that much of an offer.

658
00:51:10,760 --> 00:51:14,780
♫  Not everything is passing  ♫

659
00:51:14,780 --> 00:51:17,130
Go inside. I'm tired.

660
00:51:17,130 --> 00:51:20,510
Okay. I'll go.

661
00:51:24,170 --> 00:51:28,880
♫  A real love is lasting  ♫

662
00:51:28,880 --> 00:51:32,610
♫  I know it now  ♫

663
00:51:34,690 --> 00:51:36,430
Text me when you get home.

664
00:51:36,430 --> 00:51:38,010
Go inside.

665
00:51:43,580 --> 00:51:50,230
♫  No one but you could be her  ♫

666
00:51:50,230 --> 00:51:56,800
♫  You were the first and only one  ♫

00:51:56,800 --> 00:52:01,820

693
00:54:24,300 --> 00:54:28,260
 201 New Greenhill, Bangbae 

694
00:54:41,050 --> 00:54:44,680
 I'm sending you the first draft of the Choeseon Korean lecturers' contract. 

695
00:54:44,680 --> 00:54:48,780
 The profit division between you and the academy was left blank. 

696
00:54:48,780 --> 00:54:52,570
 Look through it and let me know the ratio you want. 

697
00:55:05,630 --> 00:55:08,200
- Attorney Cha.
 - Hey, welcome.

698
00:55:08,200 --> 00:55:10,130
I'm not interrupting you, am I?

699
00:55:10,130 --> 00:55:12,610
Skip the pleasantries and have a seat.

700
00:55:12,610 --> 00:55:16,410
- Show me what you brought. 
 - Okay.

701
00:55:16,410 --> 00:55:19,390
You asked so fast.

702
00:55:19,390 --> 00:55:21,470
I'm so busy.

703
00:55:23,770 --> 00:55:26,720
When should I get back to you about it?

704
00:55:27,730 --> 00:55:29,760
The sooner, the better.

705
00:55:31,270 --> 00:55:34,740
The thin one is the real deal. The one with two names. 
   Lecturer Contract 

706
00:55:36,010 --> 00:55:40,210
Why is my heart beating so fast? It's not even my contract.

707
00:55:40,210 --> 00:55:43,590
So? Are you finally switching jobs?

708
00:55:43,590 --> 00:55:45,710
With a huge pay raise?

709
00:55:45,710 --> 00:55:48,380
It's not like that. Just check the content first.

710
00:55:48,380 --> 00:55:50,720
What else is it, then?

711
00:55:50,720 --> 00:55:52,440
Why is it not?

712
00:55:53,900 --> 00:55:55,700
So Yeong.

713
00:55:55,700 --> 00:55:58,300
Yes, what is it?

714
00:55:58,300 --> 00:56:01,060
I feel so strange.

715
00:56:03,580 --> 00:56:07,000
Seo Hye Jin from before the free lecture

716
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:10,170
no longer seems the same afterward.

717
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:12,770
What do you mean?

718
00:56:12,770 --> 00:56:14,950
As you said, I should be writing down

719
00:56:14,950 --> 00:56:18,130
the contract provisions I want in the shorter contract and never look back.

720
00:56:18,130 --> 00:56:20,890
I should be spitting at my current job and leave.

721
00:56:20,890 --> 00:56:22,190
Just do it.

722
00:56:22,190 --> 00:56:25,110
I'll take the case if they sue you for it.

723
00:56:27,190 --> 00:56:30,170
Why can't I take the leap, then?

724
00:56:30,170 --> 00:56:31,740
Huh?

725
00:56:34,660 --> 00:56:37,300
I never had any issues before.

726
00:56:37,300 --> 00:56:40,710
I worked hard and got paid accordingly.

727
00:56:40,710 --> 00:56:45,060
When the class grew, so did my account balance.

728
00:56:45,060 --> 00:56:47,200
That's been my joy all this time.

729
00:56:47,200 --> 00:56:48,720
But?

730
00:56:49,610 --> 00:56:53,010
I don't think I could go back to then. It's

731
00:56:53,010 --> 00:56:55,190
so hard to explain it, but...

732
00:56:55,190 --> 00:56:58,040
When did you ever have trouble explaining?

733
00:56:58,040 --> 00:57:00,120
I know.

734
00:57:00,120 --> 00:57:05,110
So? Should I keep probing, or

735
00:57:05,110 --> 00:57:07,020
just watch from a distance?

736
00:57:09,710 --> 00:57:11,830
Watch from a distance.

737
00:57:13,650 --> 00:57:15,530
Because I'm scared.

738
00:57:18,560 --> 00:57:20,750
 Lee Jun Ho and Seo Hye Jin 

739
00:57:20,750 --> 00:57:26,000
 Bus No. 38 is arriving shortly. 

740
00:57:27,350 --> 00:57:32,900
 Although this was the most explosive offer. 

741
00:57:42,930 --> 00:57:45,340
 I'm sorry for making you come this far. 

742
00:57:45,340 --> 00:57:46,940
 Moms took over the cafes, 

743
00:57:46,940 --> 00:57:49,450
 and the teachers are showing up at the academy. 

744
00:57:49,450 --> 00:57:54,200
It's okay. I haven't walked in the sun for so long.

745
00:57:54,200 --> 00:57:56,000
Let me know if your legs hurt.

746
00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:59,650
I said I was fine. Just tell me what it's about.

747
00:58:01,690 --> 00:58:07,700
Ms. Seo, what would make you not join Choeseon Korean?

748
00:58:07,700 --> 00:58:09,150
What?

749
00:58:12,130 --> 00:58:16,260
I won't make ridiculous suggestions anymore.

750
00:58:16,260 --> 00:58:20,810
I'll bring 100 Chanyeong students if you want me to, and I'll do the same for Huiwon High, too.

751
00:58:20,810 --> 00:58:24,120
I'll make you way more than what Choeseon Korean proposed.

752
00:58:24,120 --> 00:58:27,530
Probably not immediately, but I'll work very hard

753
00:58:27,530 --> 00:58:30,840
and make your class grow bigger.

754
00:58:30,840 --> 00:58:33,910
Can't you stay another year with me?

755
00:58:33,910 --> 00:58:36,760
You said you want to build a building in Gangnam.

756
00:58:36,760 --> 00:58:39,710
But you'll grow your class and give it to me?

757
00:58:39,710 --> 00:58:42,340
I'm making an investment, too.

758
00:58:42,340 --> 00:58:45,870
I'll learn from you for just another year. Please?

759
00:58:45,870 --> 00:58:50,240
I'm grateful, but your promise has no collateral.

760
00:58:50,240 --> 00:58:55,120
Just trust me. You said I'm capable of anything.

761
00:58:55,120 --> 00:59:00,100
Once the Huiwon class starts, the academy will change its attitude.

762
00:59:00,100 --> 00:59:03,310
If you just keep doing what you've been doing, I'll do anything.

763
00:59:03,310 --> 00:59:05,580
I won't sleep and make teaching materials if you want.

764
00:59:05,580 --> 00:59:06,990
I'll improve the students' grades and—

765
00:59:06,990 --> 00:59:09,880
- Can you promise?
 - Pardon?

766
00:59:09,880 --> 00:59:13,040
Will you really give me the students you get?

767
00:59:14,540 --> 00:59:15,930
Yes.

768
00:59:18,980 --> 00:59:20,640
But for just one year.

769
00:59:20,640 --> 00:59:22,900
They'd all be mine after that.

770
00:59:44,480 --> 00:59:47,080
 The door is closing. 

771
00:59:50,480 --> 00:59:51,970
 - Going up. 
 - Can I get in?

772
00:59:51,970 --> 00:59:53,860
- Yes. 
- Yes.

773
01:00:03,810 --> 01:00:06,210
Isn't he Lee Si Wu?

774
01:00:06,210 --> 01:00:07,970
I think so.

775
01:00:09,530 --> 01:00:11,780
He's handsome.

776
01:00:22,010 --> 01:00:28,640
Instead of that, prepare the ads based on the market...

777
01:00:28,640 --> 01:00:30,270
Excuse me.

778
01:00:34,030 --> 01:00:35,780
Huiwon...

779
01:00:35,780 --> 01:00:38,460
Looks like you're a Huiwon High student.

780
01:00:38,460 --> 01:00:43,130
Yes. I'd like to consult about the final lecture.

781
01:00:43,130 --> 01:00:44,820
Since it's hard to improve school grades,

782
01:00:44,820 --> 01:00:49,850
some say, "I'll go for the regular admission. I'm expecting this grade."

783
01:00:52,810 --> 01:00:55,900
A Huiwon High student is here for counseling.

784
01:00:58,190 --> 01:00:59,510
Let's go, Ms. Seo.

785
01:00:59,510 --> 01:01:01,890
A student came alone? Not with his mom?

786
01:01:01,890 --> 01:01:03,580
He came alone.

787
01:01:03,580 --> 01:01:05,140
Hurry.

788
01:01:07,680 --> 01:01:09,630
Go see him alone first.

789
01:01:10,910 --> 01:01:13,820
No, you can't do that.

790
01:01:13,820 --> 01:01:15,740
He's your first student.

791
01:01:15,740 --> 01:01:20,260
Don't think, "I have to lure him and start a class."

792
01:01:20,260 --> 01:01:24,340
Just enjoy everything the first student can give you.

793
01:01:25,030 --> 01:01:26,330
Okay.

794
01:01:27,010 --> 01:01:28,740
I'll be right back.

795
01:01:36,610 --> 01:01:38,760
- Nice to see you, Si Wu. 
- Hello.

796
01:01:38,760 --> 01:01:40,360
Hi.

797
01:01:44,810 --> 01:01:47,900
I knew you'd come, but I wondered when.

798
01:01:47,900 --> 01:01:50,520
Thank you for not making me wait too long.

799
01:01:51,530 --> 01:01:53,780
Do you have somewhere to be afterward?

800
01:01:53,780 --> 01:01:56,180
No, I don't have a class today.

801
01:01:56,180 --> 01:01:57,660
That's great.

802
01:02:01,310 --> 01:02:02,800
Why do you ask?

803
01:02:03,410 --> 01:02:07,630
I didn't get to have a good look at you last time.

804
01:02:07,630 --> 01:02:09,710
As you know,

805
01:02:09,710 --> 01:02:13,230
I was humiliated by the whole universe that day.

806
01:02:14,850 --> 01:02:18,930
So, I'm finally taking it all in now.

807
01:02:20,630 --> 01:02:24,150
I haven't paid for the class yet.

808
01:02:24,150 --> 01:02:25,620
You...

809
01:02:26,810 --> 01:02:30,390
You're cutthroat, aren't you?

810
01:02:30,390 --> 01:02:35,620
Okay. Let's take the normal steps for a smooth admission.

811
01:02:35,620 --> 01:02:38,900
Just answer the question I ask freely.

812
01:02:38,900 --> 01:02:43,820
I prepared answers to the questions you might ask.

813
01:02:43,820 --> 01:02:46,600
Sounds good. Can we hear it?

814
01:02:46,600 --> 01:02:47,970
Yes.

815
01:02:48,870 --> 01:02:51,080
I'm in 10th grade at Huiwon High.

816
01:02:51,080 --> 01:02:55,130
I don't usually like Korean, but I'm not bad at it.

817
01:02:55,130 --> 01:02:59,030
I got the perfect score in the midterm.

818
01:03:00,250 --> 01:03:04,420
I consistently study Korean for an hour or two per day.

819
01:03:04,420 --> 01:03:06,940
I don't study on my own when there's an academy class.

820
01:03:07,670 --> 01:03:12,440
I don't procrastinate or skim over homework.

821
01:03:12,440 --> 01:03:13,930
And...

822
01:03:16,130 --> 01:03:20,570
it's hard for me to understand and analyze literature.

823
01:03:20,570 --> 01:03:23,610
I can blindly memorize and get the perfect score,

824
01:03:24,330 --> 01:03:28,600
but I get very flustered when I encounter unfamiliar text.

825
01:03:32,150 --> 01:03:35,490
I've said my goal is to go to medical school in Seoul,

826
01:03:35,490 --> 01:03:37,720
but that's more my mom's goal.

827
01:03:37,720 --> 01:03:39,780
I'm not so sure yet.

828
01:03:42,270 --> 01:03:45,340
I haven't decided on the elective subject yet.

829
01:03:45,340 --> 01:03:48,740
My question is whether the academy offers scholarships.

830
01:03:53,810 --> 01:03:56,350
Yes. That's it.

831
01:04:00,440 --> 01:04:02,280
Do you dislike Korean?

832
01:04:05,430 --> 01:04:07,340
I think so.

833
01:04:08,340 --> 01:04:09,900
How strange.

834
01:04:09,900 --> 01:04:12,430
Aren't you a good writer, by chance?

835
01:04:13,060 --> 01:04:15,140
I'm not talking about essay answers.

836
01:04:15,140 --> 01:04:17,930
Isn't there a kind of writing you're good at?

837
01:04:17,930 --> 01:04:20,790
Criticism or blog writing?

838
01:04:21,970 --> 01:04:23,940
How did you know?

839
01:04:25,490 --> 01:04:30,060
Because you're an excellent teenager who has to be a good writer.

840
01:04:36,680 --> 01:04:38,990
I haven't paid for the class yet.

841
01:04:38,990 --> 01:04:41,110
Let's talk about the scholarship first.

842
01:04:41,110 --> 01:04:43,940
I'm very confident in that matter.

843
01:04:43,940 --> 01:04:47,280
I was the first scholarship student at this academy.

844
01:04:47,280 --> 01:04:49,460
It's a glorious title.

845
01:04:52,080 --> 01:04:54,400
Yes, Director. You can start eating.

846
01:04:54,400 --> 01:04:58,040
I'm having a major issue at the academy.

847
01:04:58,040 --> 01:05:02,210
Yes, I'll let you know when I get there. Okay.

848
01:05:08,860 --> 01:05:12,470
Will we be able to start a class?

849
01:05:12,470 --> 01:05:15,960
Not sure. It's just that one student.

850
01:05:15,960 --> 01:05:18,990
We don't know how influential he is at school.

851
01:05:18,990 --> 01:05:22,010
Academically or socially.

852
01:05:22,640 --> 01:05:24,580
I should've asked

853
01:05:24,580 --> 01:05:28,530
who the only student was, and what he was like.

854
01:05:28,530 --> 01:05:34,380
If we get to start a class, won't it be a major event?

855
01:05:39,870 --> 01:05:44,420
We didn't make a serious mistake, did we?

856
01:05:44,420 --> 01:05:47,960
The elision will reduce the number of syllables.

857
01:05:47,960 --> 01:05:50,970
Keep that in mind and try question No. 3 again.

858
01:05:50,970 --> 01:05:52,970
What's incorrect?

859
01:06:10,010 --> 01:06:12,800
- I heard a Huiwon High student came. 
 - Yes.

860
01:06:12,800 --> 01:06:14,960
That's a major event.

861
01:06:14,960 --> 01:06:17,320
We don't know yet.

862
01:06:17,320 --> 01:06:20,480
He alone can't start a class.

863
01:06:50,010 --> 01:06:52,070
The next text.

864
01:06:53,360 --> 01:06:55,310
Let's take a 15-minute break.

865
01:07:24,900 --> 01:07:26,540
Get home safely.

866
01:07:28,300 --> 01:07:31,900
- Take care. 
 - Bye.

867
01:07:31,900 --> 01:07:33,920
Did he sign up?

868
01:07:33,920 --> 01:07:35,650
It's over.

869
01:07:51,610 --> 01:07:53,540
As for the other students...

870
01:07:59,180 --> 01:08:02,430
They get off school early tomorrow, so...

871
01:08:05,240 --> 01:08:07,340
they'll be coming then.

872
01:08:08,520 --> 01:08:12,210
So, how many do you think will come? Will it be enough to start a class?

873
01:08:12,210 --> 01:08:13,540
Yes, that won't be an issue.

874
01:08:13,540 --> 01:08:16,620
Gosh, seriously?

875
01:08:16,620 --> 01:08:20,540
We need to prepare a nice classroom. Right, Assistant Director?

876
01:08:20,540 --> 01:08:22,570
Gosh, congratulations.

877
01:08:22,570 --> 01:08:23,880
Thank you.

878
01:08:23,880 --> 01:08:26,390
Congrats, Team Leader Seo.

879
01:08:26,390 --> 01:08:29,070
- Ms. Seo.
 - Let's talk after the class.

880
01:08:29,070 --> 01:08:31,150
I'm in the middle of my class.

881
01:08:31,150 --> 01:08:33,340
Let's talk in my office.

882
01:08:33,340 --> 01:08:34,780
- Okay.
 - Let's go.

883
01:08:34,780 --> 01:08:36,180
Let's go.

884
01:08:54,960 --> 01:09:03,960


885
01:09:18,140 --> 01:09:22,150
 The Midnight Romance in Hagwon 

886
01:09:22,150 --> 01:09:24,450
 You can join Choeseon Korean. 

887
01:09:24,450 --> 01:09:27,420
 How disappointing. I was hoping for a beautiful goodbye. 

888
01:09:27,420 --> 01:09:29,180
 Don't act all high and mighty. 

889
01:09:29,180 --> 01:09:30,380
 Geez! 

890
01:09:30,380 --> 01:09:33,300
 I can't imagine the academy without Seo Hye Jin. 

891
01:09:33,300 --> 01:09:38,080
 Someone like that can get scary once they change their mind. 

892
01:09:38,080 --> 01:09:39,780
 Do you have time to loaf around? 

893
01:09:39,780 --> 01:09:41,280
 Just focus on your goal. 

894
01:09:41,280 --> 01:09:44,620
 I'm trying way harder to hold back than you think. 

895
01:09:44,620 --> 01:09:47,720
 Ms. Seo, you're such a headache. 

896
01:09:47,720 --> 01:09:49,650
 What am I supposed to do when you do this? 

897
01:09:49,650 --> 01:09:53,740
♫  Can you catch me?  ♫
