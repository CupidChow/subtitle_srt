 The Midnight Romance in Hagwon 

13
00:00:50,570 --> 00:00:52,190
Were you supposed to meet here?

14
00:00:52,190 --> 00:00:53,890
 Episode 15 

15
00:00:53,890 --> 00:00:55,720
No.

16
00:00:59,890 --> 00:01:02,070
We didn't talk about much.

17
00:01:07,960 --> 00:01:09,790
Have a seat.

18
00:01:11,010 --> 00:01:20,000


19
00:01:22,180 --> 00:01:23,990
It's nothing.

20
00:01:28,890 --> 00:01:32,320
You two had a hard day today.

21
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:36,050
I suppose he was a bit shocked.

22
00:01:36,050 --> 00:01:38,700
He cried because he was a bit shocked?

23
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:40,220
Did he?

24
00:01:40,220 --> 00:01:42,840
- I mean—
 - Don't blame him for no reason.

25
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:44,560
I guess...

26
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:46,640
I was just a bit tired.

27
00:01:47,730 --> 00:01:49,500
I apologize for what happened.

28
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:51,140
Blame me if you want to—

29
00:01:51,140 --> 00:01:54,660
Ms. Seo, it's not like that.

30
00:01:54,660 --> 00:01:57,040
I said I was just tired.

31
00:01:57,040 --> 00:01:58,830
Do you expect me to believe that?

32
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:02,630
I'm asking you to ignore it.

33
00:02:02,630 --> 00:02:05,950
- But you're like this— 
- Yes, I cried like a baby.

34
00:02:07,430 --> 00:02:09,860
So, just let it go.

35
00:02:14,820 --> 00:02:16,560
Did you have dinner?

36
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:18,130
Yes.

37
00:02:20,820 --> 00:02:22,810
I'll go to the restroom.

38
00:02:28,210 --> 00:02:32,400
Excuse me. Please give that table something to eat.

39
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:34,960
Something easy to digest, please.

40
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:36,540
Okay.

41
00:02:38,490 --> 00:02:45,550
If there's a cigarette a customer left, could I...

42
00:02:48,410 --> 00:02:49,890
Here.

43
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:54,400
I should've called you.

44
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:56,360
You must've waited a long time.

45
00:02:57,540 --> 00:02:59,870
You went through a lot today.

46
00:03:01,010 --> 00:03:02,330
Why don't you eat something first—

47
00:03:02,330 --> 00:03:05,690
I heard you kicked a student out during a class.

48
00:03:09,970 --> 00:03:11,890
Why did you do that?

49
00:03:13,930 --> 00:03:16,130
I didn't want to teach him.

50
00:03:18,220 --> 00:03:20,690
Don't be emotional.

51
00:03:21,320 --> 00:03:23,080
Think about the damage to the academy.

52
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:25,890
Each student is so important.

53
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:28,970
If you kicked out everyone for being bratty—

54
00:03:28,970 --> 00:03:30,830
Is that...

55
00:03:31,700 --> 00:03:36,500
Is that really what you want to talk about now?

56
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,640
Will you...

57
00:03:40,980 --> 00:03:43,640
answer me if I ask why you cried?

58
00:03:46,010 --> 00:03:49,090
A lot of kids think we're beneath them.

59
00:03:49,090 --> 00:03:51,280
Not stuff like that.

60
00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:54,920
What you really wanted to say.

61
00:03:54,920 --> 00:03:57,150
How today was.

62
00:03:57,850 --> 00:03:59,070
Stuff like that.

63
00:03:59,070 --> 00:04:02,310
You don't have to tolerate the jokes, disrespect, or harassment, but—

64
00:04:02,310 --> 00:04:07,580
Say, today was really tough... and tiring.

65
00:04:07,580 --> 00:04:10,000
- Stuff like that.
 - Getting emotional doesn't help.

66
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,680
"Jun Ho...

67
00:04:13,690 --> 00:04:17,350
rumors are nastier than I thought." Stuff like that.

68
00:04:17,350 --> 00:04:20,360
Call the student tomorrow. Apologize.

69
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:23,040
"The students and mothers...

70
00:04:23,850 --> 00:04:26,230
are so disloyal."

71
00:04:26,230 --> 00:04:28,390
Say it was unfair and upsetting.

72
00:04:28,390 --> 00:04:32,010
Say stuff like that to me.

73
00:04:32,010 --> 00:04:34,170
Why would you say that?

74
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:39,300
You're the one who cried your eyes out. Why talk to me like that?

75
00:04:45,190 --> 00:04:47,750
The kid you kicked out is infamous. His dad—

76
00:04:47,750 --> 00:04:50,120
Say it's all my fault.

77
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:54,950
Say stuff like that.

78
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:02,560
- The entire day today— 
- The entire day?

79
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:04,450
The entire day...

80
00:05:05,980 --> 00:05:11,220
I wondered, what if I weren't your teacher, okay?

81
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:15,580
What if I were your age?

82
00:05:15,580 --> 00:05:18,100
I thought that, okay?

83
00:05:21,380 --> 00:05:24,650
The prettiest girl at school who liked you.

84
00:05:24,650 --> 00:05:27,180
What if that were me?

85
00:05:28,270 --> 00:05:30,730
There wouldn't be a rumor like this, then. Right?

86
00:05:33,230 --> 00:05:37,400
What if I had a fine job?

87
00:05:38,290 --> 00:05:42,720
My career wouldn't be destroyed by having an office romance.

88
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:44,400
Yes.

89
00:05:46,650 --> 00:05:49,170
It's so nasty and unfair.

90
00:05:52,150 --> 00:05:55,240
I knew there was no loyalty in this town,

91
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:58,380
but I still have to beg to survive.

92
00:05:58,380 --> 00:06:01,990
"How pathetic." That's what I thought, okay?

93
00:06:04,100 --> 00:06:06,130
Are you satisfied?

94
00:06:13,570 --> 00:06:17,000
- You can go on. 
- Give me a break.

95
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,410
You were crying your eyes out here.

96
00:06:19,410 --> 00:06:22,810
You made me feel incredibly small.

97
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:51,590
Thank you.

98
00:08:06,790 --> 00:08:09,540
Thank you for the meal.

99
00:08:21,290 --> 00:08:23,930
 Closed 

100
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:28,990
Can I pour you a glass?

101
00:08:28,990 --> 00:08:30,560
Gosh.

102
00:08:38,810 --> 00:08:41,580
This is on me, okay?

103
00:08:41,580 --> 00:08:43,520
I struck gold.

104
00:08:49,950 --> 00:08:55,200
Academy teachers don't usually bond with students.

105
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:58,080
Otherwise, it's too hard when the new year starts.

106
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:00,970
That's what everyone says,

107
00:09:00,970 --> 00:09:03,780
but I'm the busiest in graduation season.

108
00:09:03,780 --> 00:09:07,530
I suppose they feel lonely. They drink often.

109
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:12,830
It's to forget the students quickly.

110
00:09:12,830 --> 00:09:15,630
They try not to be curious about them, either.

111
00:09:16,310 --> 00:09:20,600
How they turned out or what kind of people they became.

112
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:24,020
That's not our business.

113
00:09:24,020 --> 00:09:28,400
But I'm curious about Lee Jun Ho.

114
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:30,540
I wonder how he'd turn out.

115
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:33,700
Although he's already grown.

116
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:37,850
I'm such a pathetic bastard, too.

117
00:09:38,540 --> 00:09:42,780
That's what I think of when I'm about to go out of business tomorrow.

118
00:09:42,780 --> 00:09:44,970
Gosh, why wouldn't you?

119
00:09:44,970 --> 00:09:47,900
Even during wartime, people made art,

120
00:09:47,900 --> 00:09:51,270
fell in love, and joined the Olympics, too.

121
00:09:51,270 --> 00:09:52,960
I suppose.

122
00:10:12,750 --> 00:10:15,150
It's almost spring soon.

123
00:10:15,150 --> 00:10:18,140
Gosh, time flies.

124
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:25,840
Time will pass in a blink once the new students join.

125
00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:29,210
You've overcome mishaps so far.

126
00:10:31,060 --> 00:10:32,850
Yes.

127
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:37,810
If I have any teachers left at all.

128
00:11:02,670 --> 00:11:04,770
Don't do stuff like that.

129
00:11:05,670 --> 00:11:09,450
Taking your coat off for me and running together in the rain.

130
00:11:09,450 --> 00:11:11,480
I won't do stuff like that with you.

131
00:11:48,980 --> 00:11:50,590
Get dried before you go.

132
00:11:50,590 --> 00:11:52,210
What if you catch a cold—

133
00:11:52,210 --> 00:11:53,990
None of your business.

134
00:11:54,970 --> 00:11:56,800
Okay.

135
00:11:56,800 --> 00:12:00,900
I'll tell you why I was crying pitifully.

136
00:12:21,560 --> 00:12:23,250
I'm sorry...

137
00:12:23,870 --> 00:12:25,870
for upsetting you.

138
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:31,300
But don't think about stuff, like what if you weren't my teacher.

139
00:12:31,300 --> 00:12:33,610
I've never even imagined it.

140
00:12:35,070 --> 00:12:36,890
Age difference or

141
00:12:36,890 --> 00:12:40,150
the prettiest girl in school who liked me.

142
00:12:40,150 --> 00:12:41,680
Forget about all that.

143
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:44,380
I don't even remember her name.

144
00:12:45,230 --> 00:12:47,680
I remember.

145
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:49,900
It was Jo Yun Hui.

146
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:56,580
I knew because I overheard Seung Gyu and Ho Jae talking about her.

147
00:13:00,420 --> 00:13:03,710
Tell me. Why did you cry?

148
00:13:07,010 --> 00:13:08,640
Jun Ho.

149
00:13:12,970 --> 00:13:15,040
Teacher Lee Jun Ho.

150
00:13:18,270 --> 00:13:21,040
Lee Jun Ho who fears nothing.

151
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:23,930
Lee Jun Ho achieves anything he sets his mind to.

152
00:13:24,690 --> 00:13:27,830
I realized all of that was pathetic narcissism.

153
00:13:28,970 --> 00:13:33,320
I finally realized that when I saw you being torn apart.

154
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:36,650
I didn't anticipate what would happen to you.

155
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:43,500
I tried to justify everything with love. I thought that's all that mattered.

156
00:13:43,500 --> 00:13:46,040
I'm ashamed about all of that.

157
00:13:47,940 --> 00:13:51,580
My mom found you by searching the entire Daechi-dong.

158
00:13:52,270 --> 00:13:55,570
I got cocky that I improved my grades with you.

159
00:13:55,570 --> 00:13:58,130
That was ridiculous.

160
00:13:58,130 --> 00:14:03,260
I acted like I had achieved something great when I got into a good school.

161
00:14:03,260 --> 00:14:05,540
Jun Ho.

162
00:14:05,540 --> 00:14:10,690
My parents and you were ready to support and have faith in me, no matter what.

163
00:14:11,950 --> 00:14:14,560
The moment broke free from that support,

164
00:14:15,210 --> 00:14:20,410
I realized I was an idiot who gets flustered by stuff like this.

165
00:14:21,740 --> 00:14:26,190
But seeing you taking the blame for everything,

166
00:14:26,190 --> 00:14:28,440
I finally realized it.

167
00:14:29,670 --> 00:14:31,700
That I was still...

168
00:14:33,190 --> 00:14:38,920
a child who couldn't even take a step outside the classroom where we first met.

169
00:14:39,510 --> 00:14:41,280
It's...

170
00:14:42,590 --> 00:14:45,280
because of the way I am.

171
00:14:45,280 --> 00:14:50,650
I wasn't able to change the way you are at all...

172
00:14:51,330 --> 00:14:53,600
when I supposedly love you.

173
00:14:59,350 --> 00:15:05,040
Now I need to leave that tiny classroom from 10 years ago.

174
00:15:06,260 --> 00:15:09,760
By reading, writing, and...

175
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:12,020
doing what I was told to,

176
00:15:12,020 --> 00:15:15,950
I was praised and loved plenty.

177
00:15:17,590 --> 00:15:19,350
Thank you.

178
00:15:20,580 --> 00:15:24,320
♫  And I ran wild  ♫

179
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:26,000
But I...

180
00:15:28,920 --> 00:15:31,020
I...

181
00:15:31,020 --> 00:15:32,900
It took a bit of time,

182
00:15:34,410 --> 00:15:36,180
but give it to me now.

183
00:15:37,710 --> 00:15:39,760
My shiny diploma.

184
00:15:41,030 --> 00:15:46,160
♫  And things were simple then  ♫

185
00:15:47,950 --> 00:15:50,580
There's another thing that bothers me.

186
00:15:52,280 --> 00:15:56,480
♫  Since I've loved you  ♫

187
00:15:58,060 --> 00:16:02,550
Do you remember when I stopped by before I started working here?

188
00:16:02,550 --> 00:16:04,860
♫  Trying to be seen  ♫

189
00:16:04,860 --> 00:16:08,410
You told me something that day right here.

190
00:16:08,410 --> 00:16:12,680
 Of course. You're capable of anything. 

191
00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:15,000
I'll let you take that back.

192
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,700
I don't want to. What would be the point?

193
00:16:17,700 --> 00:16:21,500
You won't have to think that you have to beg to survive in this environment.

194
00:16:21,500 --> 00:16:23,740
I'm 35 years old.

195
00:16:23,740 --> 00:16:27,540
I'd support you if you said you'd become an idol trainee now.

196
00:16:28,220 --> 00:16:31,180
Let's go. I have a class tomorrow morning.

197
00:16:33,230 --> 00:16:38,420
♫  Just like they've always been  ♫

198
00:16:38,420 --> 00:16:44,770
♫  Will our love ever end?  ♫

199
00:16:45,950 --> 00:16:49,800
♫  I'll never know  ♫

200
00:17:41,050 --> 00:17:44,110
 I wondered what if I weren't your teacher? 

201
00:17:49,330 --> 00:17:52,500
 What if I were your age? 

202
00:17:52,500 --> 00:18:02,630
♫  Chasing whatever they might call a dream  ♫

203
00:18:02,630 --> 00:18:07,750
♫  But you came after all  ♫

204
00:18:07,750 --> 00:18:12,100
♫  Said look away  ♫

205
00:18:12,850 --> 00:18:18,010
♫  And things were simple then ♫

206
00:18:18,010 --> 00:18:23,300
♫  Just like they've always been  ♫

207
00:18:23,300 --> 00:18:29,570
♫  Will our love ever end  ♫

208
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:35,070
♫  I'll never know  ♫

209
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:58,130
Didn't you get rained on on your way home?

210
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:03,640
It poured all of a sudden.

211
00:19:03,640 --> 00:19:06,390
I said you didn't have to drop me off.

212
00:19:06,390 --> 00:19:08,080
You were so stubborn.

213
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:11,840
Getting rained on isn't a big deal.

214
00:19:12,930 --> 00:19:16,160
Anyway, more importantly, is your throat okay?

215
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:18,290
You basically destroyed the noraebang.

216
00:19:18,290 --> 00:19:21,320
You haven't seen anything yet.

217
00:19:21,320 --> 00:19:24,000
That wasn't even 50% of my ability.

218
00:19:35,180 --> 00:19:38,670
I have no class from one to four. Bye.

219
00:19:38,670 --> 00:19:39,670
Team Leader.

220
00:19:39,670 --> 00:19:44,310
I would've just walked by if I'd known you were on the phone.

221
00:19:44,910 --> 00:19:47,290
I can't tell when people are wearing that.

222
00:19:47,290 --> 00:19:49,380
It's okay.

223
00:19:50,140 --> 00:19:52,060
Looks like you haven't had breakfast.

224
00:19:52,060 --> 00:19:54,350
Well, no.

225
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:58,620
Smells tasty.

226
00:19:58,620 --> 00:20:01,380
Pick what you want. It's my treat.

227
00:20:03,040 --> 00:20:04,570
I'm bribing you.

228
00:20:04,570 --> 00:20:06,650
Me?

229
00:20:06,650 --> 00:20:08,960
I want to leave a good impression on you

230
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:11,970
if we end up on the same side.

231
00:20:11,970 --> 00:20:13,930
I teach social studies, you know.

232
00:20:13,930 --> 00:20:17,490
I need to impress Korean teachers.

233
00:20:18,470 --> 00:20:20,200
Yes.

234
00:20:35,910 --> 00:20:37,430
Here.

235
00:20:51,610 --> 00:20:59,090
Team Leader Seo has been so good at promoting other teachers.

236
00:20:59,090 --> 00:21:01,510
She handed out fliers every time

237
00:21:01,510 --> 00:21:06,050
and she timed everything perfectly, including the dinner breaks.

238
00:21:08,560 --> 00:21:10,740
She was incredible.

239
00:21:11,970 --> 00:21:14,400
Even the teachers who complained about the ad

240
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:17,590
when we competed against Choeseon Korean

241
00:21:17,590 --> 00:21:21,360
stopped complaining because of that.

242
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:27,810
Now the teachers who were closest to her were hurt the most?

243
00:21:30,140 --> 00:21:33,310
It doesn't get more ironic than this.

244
00:21:33,310 --> 00:21:36,400
One good thing is...

245
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:39,980
that the Korean department wasn't hurt as much

246
00:21:39,980 --> 00:21:43,100
since their students overlapped with Team Leader Seo.

247
00:21:43,100 --> 00:21:46,280
Their schedules were totally separated, too.

248
00:21:51,930 --> 00:21:54,480
We can't relax about that, either.

249
00:21:55,910 --> 00:21:57,700
What do you mean?

250
00:21:58,850 --> 00:22:02,730
Assistant Director ... Woo Seung Hui...

251
00:22:03,650 --> 00:22:06,410
set another trap.

252
00:22:11,330 --> 00:22:14,630
Could you tell me in detail?

253
00:22:14,630 --> 00:22:16,300
Seriously...

254
00:22:16,300 --> 00:22:19,460
Are you saying that Wu Seung Hui left with Seo Hye Jin's files?

255
00:22:19,460 --> 00:22:22,930
Yes. She tempted me using that.

256
00:22:22,930 --> 00:22:25,700
She said she'd let me have all the Chanyeong students.

257
00:22:25,700 --> 00:22:28,390
Why didn't you tell people that?

258
00:22:28,390 --> 00:22:30,320
About how awful Wu Seung Hui is.

259
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:35,480
Because that'd mean Team Leader Seo is totally screwed

260
00:22:35,480 --> 00:22:40,210
and she's got nothing, you know.

261
00:22:40,210 --> 00:22:42,200
Geez.

262
00:22:51,380 --> 00:22:53,370
Aren't you scared, by the way?

263
00:22:54,620 --> 00:22:57,760
You said you badly wanted to work in this neighborhood.

264
00:22:57,760 --> 00:23:00,050
Everything is about to be ruined.

265
00:23:01,300 --> 00:23:03,360
I have things to count on.

266
00:23:04,990 --> 00:23:07,270
My students like me.

267
00:23:07,270 --> 00:23:10,010
They'd like me no matter where I am.

268
00:23:10,010 --> 00:23:11,870
Ms. Nam,

269
00:23:12,900 --> 00:23:14,570
you're cool.

270
00:23:24,370 --> 00:23:28,170
Does Wu Seung Hui think we killed her parents or something?

271
00:23:31,870 --> 00:23:34,150
What are you looking around for?

272
00:23:34,150 --> 00:23:39,210
I'm surprised that you already have an office.

273
00:23:41,900 --> 00:23:46,070
This is why I've always liked you.

274
00:23:46,070 --> 00:23:48,930
You're cute and innocent.

275
00:23:48,930 --> 00:23:51,330
That's why you easily connect with students, too.

276
00:23:51,330 --> 00:23:54,100
It's needless to say, you're the prettiest one, too.

277
00:23:54,100 --> 00:23:57,280
I wouldn't say "the prettiest."

278
00:23:57,280 --> 00:23:59,220
Lee Jun Ho has poor taste.

279
00:23:59,220 --> 00:24:02,780
Seo Hye Jin doesn't even compare to you.

280
00:24:02,780 --> 00:24:06,920
But complimenting in words doesn't do any good, right?

281
00:24:06,920 --> 00:24:08,640
Pros...

282
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:12,770
communicate through contracts.

283
00:24:15,670 --> 00:24:18,060
- Yes.
 - I...

284
00:24:18,060 --> 00:24:22,950
think I could incentivize you generously, too.

285
00:24:24,180 --> 00:24:27,320
What do we do with the parents' orientation?

286
00:24:28,600 --> 00:24:30,750
I should've gone to Mok-dong when they wanted me.

287
00:24:30,750 --> 00:24:33,650
Maybe the Assistant Director is really starting an academy.

288
00:24:37,180 --> 00:24:39,700
You don't have a class. Why did you come?

289
00:24:39,700 --> 00:24:41,510
To study.

290
00:24:42,310 --> 00:24:45,260
Don't say such obvious lies.

291
00:24:47,170 --> 00:24:49,070
You're waiting for Team Leader Lee, right?

292
00:24:49,070 --> 00:24:51,700
I noticed you've been looking at the desk.

293
00:24:53,690 --> 00:24:55,720
Of course.

294
00:24:55,720 --> 00:24:57,680
This is why I can't fool you.

295
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:00,780
Do you regret not killing him yesterday?

296
00:25:00,780 --> 00:25:02,890
Will you finish him off today?

297
00:25:04,870 --> 00:25:05,990
Yes.

298
00:25:05,990 --> 00:25:08,490
The road was so slippery.

299
00:25:09,290 --> 00:25:10,770
Good morning.

300
00:25:10,770 --> 00:25:12,710
- Are you preparing for your class? 
- Yes.

301
00:25:12,710 --> 00:25:15,950
I knew you really were something else.

302
00:25:15,950 --> 00:25:18,920
Regardless of the situation...

303
00:25:18,920 --> 00:25:20,960
Is that the power of love?

304
00:25:24,620 --> 00:25:28,140
I'll call the ambulance. Make sure to kill him.

305
00:25:38,300 --> 00:25:39,700
What?

306
00:25:44,220 --> 00:25:45,840
What is it?

307
00:25:50,290 --> 00:25:53,800
From the very start, I've wanted to point this out.

308
00:25:53,800 --> 00:25:57,020
The way you treat your seniors

309
00:25:57,020 --> 00:25:59,590
is seriously wrong.

310
00:26:00,650 --> 00:26:02,430
Is that so?

311
00:26:03,960 --> 00:26:05,680
I didn't know.

312
00:26:07,780 --> 00:26:09,430
Yes, so

313
00:26:09,430 --> 00:26:14,750
you should have manners and follow procedures if you want to say something to a seonbae.

314
00:26:16,370 --> 00:26:18,460
Manners and procedures.

315
00:26:19,220 --> 00:26:20,520
Okay.

316
00:26:21,420 --> 00:26:23,840
Is there anything else I need to improve on?

317
00:26:24,850 --> 00:26:26,710
Tell me everything.

318
00:26:26,710 --> 00:26:30,230
Everything that has been bothering you and the mistakes I've made.

319
00:26:33,490 --> 00:26:36,230
You should think about that on your own.

320
00:26:37,340 --> 00:26:38,900
If so...

321
00:26:39,960 --> 00:26:43,990
I apologize for being rude yesterday.

322
00:26:44,680 --> 00:26:47,530
I wasn't thinking clearly when I said those things.

323
00:26:48,330 --> 00:26:50,060
I'm sorry.

324
00:26:54,460 --> 00:26:58,150
See? You can't even apologize properly.

325
00:26:58,150 --> 00:27:00,400
That's not how you apologize.

326
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:03,360
Explain how you were wrong in detail,

327
00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:05,520
how you hurt the other person,

328
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:07,450
what you're regretting,

329
00:27:07,450 --> 00:27:09,310
and how you'll take responsibility.

330
00:27:09,310 --> 00:27:11,740
You need to say those things.

331
00:27:11,740 --> 00:27:13,910
I didn't address you properly...

332
00:27:13,910 --> 00:27:18,300
and I insulted you by mentioning your students. I apologize.

333
00:27:18,300 --> 00:27:23,490
I should've listened to you and explained myself,

334
00:27:24,060 --> 00:27:26,890
but I got too emotional.

335
00:27:28,270 --> 00:27:30,420
Team Leader Seo and I

336
00:27:30,420 --> 00:27:34,070
raised enough suspicion, but I didn't think of that.

337
00:27:35,130 --> 00:27:38,950
From now on, before I do anything,

338
00:27:40,040 --> 00:27:42,640
I'll politely follow procedures and...

339
00:27:43,670 --> 00:27:47,320
ask for advice from my seniors.

340
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:50,740
Do you mean you regret it?

341
00:27:50,740 --> 00:27:52,720
I'll never forget what I did.

342
00:27:54,780 --> 00:27:56,280
If so...

343
00:27:57,730 --> 00:28:00,270
I don't hold grudges or anything, either.

344
00:28:03,140 --> 00:28:06,380
Get back to work. I need to prepare for a class.

345
00:28:17,660 --> 00:28:20,060
I sent you an email.

346
00:28:20,060 --> 00:28:22,160
What email?

347
00:28:22,160 --> 00:28:23,910
Have a look.

348
00:28:34,710 --> 00:28:38,110
 To Team Leader Lee 

349
00:28:38,110 --> 00:28:42,130
 These are entrance exam, mock entrance exam, Office of Education exams, 

350
00:28:42,130 --> 00:28:44,450
 LEET exam style and question analysis, 

351
00:28:44,450 --> 00:28:47,930
 and reading material for essay questions. 

352
00:28:47,930 --> 00:28:50,730
 I collected these while writing my textbook. It's not much, 

353
00:28:50,730 --> 00:28:53,310
 but I hope you find it useful. 

354
00:28:54,620 --> 00:28:58,050
What was that? You said you'd kill him.

355
00:29:00,630 --> 00:29:03,710
Did you plant a virus in the email or something?

356
00:29:03,710 --> 00:29:05,740
Shouldn't you go to your class?

357
00:29:07,740 --> 00:29:09,500
I will.

358
00:29:21,210 --> 00:29:23,770
What was wrong with Mr. Lee?

359
00:29:23,770 --> 00:29:26,040
Even I felt mortified.

360
00:29:26,040 --> 00:29:29,350
I'll tell him. He'd be happy to hear it.

361
00:29:53,350 --> 00:29:54,860
What?

362
00:29:57,920 --> 00:29:59,750
I'm not that unaware.

363
00:29:59,750 --> 00:30:01,910
What's this show you're putting on?

364
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:06,830
It's not a show.

365
00:30:06,830 --> 00:30:08,120
I'm really regretting it.

366
00:30:08,120 --> 00:30:10,120
What's your goal?

367
00:30:16,100 --> 00:30:18,950
Hurry up and tell me. I need to go to my class.

368
00:30:18,950 --> 00:30:22,640
I can't ask for anything in this situation.

369
00:30:25,350 --> 00:30:27,310
But there's one thing.

370
00:30:28,650 --> 00:30:31,700
I want at least one teacher to stay at the academy.

371
00:30:31,700 --> 00:30:36,550
If I could do that, I could even crawl in front of you.

372
00:30:36,550 --> 00:30:38,380
Why would you do that? I don't need that.

373
00:30:38,380 --> 00:30:40,720
Tell me what you need, then.

374
00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:44,460
Team Leader Seo has fallen, and the academy ace position is open.

375
00:30:44,460 --> 00:30:47,470
The academy needs a new hero now.

376
00:30:47,470 --> 00:30:50,410
Choeseon Korean has been teaching only Korean for 20 years.

377
00:30:50,410 --> 00:30:52,200
They're known to have quality teachers.

378
00:30:52,200 --> 00:30:54,230
Instead of competing with them, just stay here—

379
00:30:54,230 --> 00:30:56,130
Are you a stockholder of this academy?

380
00:30:56,130 --> 00:30:58,160
Aren't you doing too much?

381
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:02,650
I really like Ms. Seo a lot.

382
00:31:03,990 --> 00:31:05,720
What's this now?

383
00:31:05,720 --> 00:31:09,850
I don't want her to live with the guilt for making the

384
00:31:09,850 --> 00:31:12,820
academy, and the teachers fail.

385
00:31:15,640 --> 00:31:16,950
There's no time.

386
00:31:16,950 --> 00:31:20,370
The other academies are already ready to accept the soon-to-be 10th graders.

387
00:31:20,370 --> 00:31:22,440
The students get flushed out every year.

388
00:31:22,440 --> 00:31:26,560
This is the best time to renew the reputation. Please.

389
00:31:26,560 --> 00:31:29,390
I've worked at the academy much longer than you.

390
00:31:29,390 --> 00:31:32,190
Don't say such obvious things.

391
00:31:32,190 --> 00:31:33,870
I'm sorry.

392
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:56,180
Did you even memorize your students' names?

393
00:31:56,180 --> 00:31:58,980
What are you doing here?

394
00:32:00,560 --> 00:32:04,030
More than a hundred students switched academies all at once.

395
00:32:04,030 --> 00:32:05,530
Yes.

396
00:32:05,530 --> 00:32:09,410
That's why you should be very busy right now.

397
00:32:10,090 --> 00:32:14,570
The students' consultation files fell on my lap too quickly.

398
00:32:15,390 --> 00:32:17,690
You should be thankful.

399
00:32:17,690 --> 00:32:21,420
I'm letting you solely focus on teaching the class.

400
00:32:22,790 --> 00:32:25,600
What happened to Seo Hye Jin and Lee Jun Ho...

401
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:27,690
By chance, were you behind it?

402
00:32:29,740 --> 00:32:31,590
Tell me.

403
00:32:36,470 --> 00:32:41,270
I don't discuss how I run the academy with anyone.

404
00:32:41,270 --> 00:32:44,210
I never have, I don't now,

405
00:32:44,210 --> 00:32:46,590
and I never will.

406
00:32:48,830 --> 00:32:50,820
I'm the assistant director.

407
00:32:50,820 --> 00:32:57,450
Mr. Pyo Sang Seob. Teach the class and get more students.

408
00:32:58,320 --> 00:33:01,320
Don't overstep the boundaries.

409
00:33:01,320 --> 00:33:02,860
I'll be in touch.

410
00:33:02,860 --> 00:33:04,850
I'm sorry we couldn't have lunch together.

411
00:33:04,850 --> 00:33:08,640
No, it's okay. You have many people to meet with.

412
00:33:09,310 --> 00:33:10,620
I'll get going.

413
00:33:10,620 --> 00:33:12,140
Okay.

414
00:33:13,040 --> 00:33:16,220
- Safe travels.
 - Yes, take care.

415
00:33:27,740 --> 00:33:31,330
 I think Lee Jun Ho will propose something to Team Leader Lee. 

416
00:33:35,540 --> 00:33:37,090
 I'll meet with him. 

417
00:33:37,090 --> 00:33:39,420
 Make sure to pack all of my stuff. 

418
00:33:39,420 --> 00:33:42,400
 Be sure to reformat the computer. 

419
00:33:50,450 --> 00:33:54,800
 That's the kind of person Wu Seung Hui is. 

420
00:33:55,490 --> 00:33:59,180
 People's hidden emotions buried deep down. 

421
00:33:59,180 --> 00:34:03,240
 She can smell that stale stench instinctively. 

422
00:34:10,600 --> 00:34:16,120
Lee Myeong Jun would get tricked by something like that.

423
00:34:27,350 --> 00:34:30,640
 Lee Jun Ho - Korean 

424
00:34:51,630 --> 00:34:55,360
 Assistant Director Wu Seung Hui 

425
00:34:57,900 --> 00:35:00,600
 Assistant Director Wu Seung Hui 

426
00:35:05,480 --> 00:35:08,700
Are these all the students who are leaving—

427
00:35:08,700 --> 00:35:10,310
Yes.

428
00:35:10,310 --> 00:35:16,830
Team Leader Choi and I are calling all of them, but...

429
00:35:19,030 --> 00:35:22,540
I knew we'd lose students, but...

430
00:35:24,530 --> 00:35:29,740
Some of the classes need to be canceled, then, right?

431
00:35:29,740 --> 00:35:34,550
The thing is the director doesn't

432
00:35:34,550 --> 00:35:36,570
think the policies are that important.

433
00:35:36,570 --> 00:35:42,050
He wants the teachers to feel relieved to teach the classes for now.

434
00:35:44,250 --> 00:35:47,210
My students didn't...

435
00:35:47,960 --> 00:35:50,300
tell me anything.

436
00:35:51,320 --> 00:35:54,640
The group chat is quiet

437
00:35:54,640 --> 00:35:58,270
and I haven't received that many messages, either.

438
00:35:58,270 --> 00:36:04,690
How do we know if you understand the text?

439
00:36:04,690 --> 00:36:09,540
You should be able to rewrite the sentence you read in your language.

440
00:36:09,540 --> 00:36:13,450
You must've heard of this while filling in the blanks in English class. What do you call this?

441
00:36:13,450 --> 00:36:16,410
Ms. Seo, the class ended.

442
00:36:16,410 --> 00:36:17,990
Sorry, I'll be done in a minute.

443
00:36:17,990 --> 00:36:19,460
What do you call this?

444
00:36:19,460 --> 00:36:20,770
Paraphrasing.

445
00:36:20,770 --> 00:36:23,070
Yes, it means "jaejinsul" in Korean.

446
00:36:23,070 --> 00:36:25,740
It requires vocabulary and comprehension skills.

447
00:36:25,740 --> 00:36:27,720
If you work on these little by little,

448
00:36:27,720 --> 00:36:32,740
you'll notice that the English and Korean grades are connected.

449
00:36:40,980 --> 00:36:44,680
 Team Leader Seo has fallen and the academy ace position is open. 

450
00:37:00,480 --> 00:37:04,340
Where's everyone? The culprits who started this.

451
00:37:05,160 --> 00:37:10,160
 Assistant Director's Office 

452
00:37:12,220 --> 00:37:13,750
 Yes. 

453
00:37:22,040 --> 00:37:24,300
Did you have lunch just now?

454
00:37:25,060 --> 00:37:27,670
No, I was about to leave to meet someone.

455
00:37:29,350 --> 00:37:31,820
You were cool earlier.

456
00:37:31,820 --> 00:37:34,820
Team Leader Lee probably squirmed a bit.

457
00:37:41,880 --> 00:37:43,990
Why are you looking at me like that?

458
00:37:43,990 --> 00:37:46,620
Didn't you come in to tell me something?

459
00:37:48,530 --> 00:37:51,840
To be clear, apologizing won't work for me.

460
00:37:51,840 --> 00:37:54,050
I'm not Lee Myeong Jun.

461
00:37:55,350 --> 00:37:58,030
I have nothing to apologize to you about.

462
00:37:58,850 --> 00:38:00,840
You don't feel bad toward me about anything?

463
00:38:00,840 --> 00:38:02,320
No.

464
00:38:03,320 --> 00:38:06,090
Why are you making things awkward, then?

465
00:38:06,090 --> 00:38:09,280
Do we have something to talk about?

466
00:38:18,780 --> 00:38:20,970
I wanted to give you a chance.

467
00:38:22,530 --> 00:38:24,830
Get your act together.

468
00:38:24,830 --> 00:38:27,020
Don't ruin yourself further.

469
00:38:30,900 --> 00:38:33,040
Seo Hye Jin was like this, too.

470
00:38:34,670 --> 00:38:38,420
You don't understand the situation, either.

471
00:38:39,220 --> 00:38:41,380
Who do you think is ruined now?

472
00:38:41,380 --> 00:38:43,060
You.

473
00:38:44,040 --> 00:38:48,930
Trying to destroy someone you used to like isn't exactly normal.

474
00:38:48,930 --> 00:38:51,140
Lucky you.

475
00:38:51,140 --> 00:38:53,610
You don't know how that feels.

476
00:38:56,400 --> 00:38:58,910
Camaraderie, friendship, or loyalty.

477
00:38:59,590 --> 00:39:02,920
You've never lurked around someone pretending it's one of those, right?

478
00:39:03,540 --> 00:39:05,670
I have.

479
00:39:05,670 --> 00:39:08,900
I even moved out of my parent's place.

480
00:39:08,900 --> 00:39:11,330
Near Ms. Seo's place.

481
00:39:14,290 --> 00:39:16,680
When you two started seeing each other,

482
00:39:16,680 --> 00:39:19,610
Team Leader Seo should've told me.

483
00:39:19,610 --> 00:39:22,420
She should've stopped me from lurking.

484
00:39:24,410 --> 00:39:28,080
She should've thought about how embarrassed I would've felt.

485
00:39:28,710 --> 00:39:33,870
What's so embarrassing about lurking around someone you like?

486
00:39:34,570 --> 00:39:37,700
Ruining everything around you just because she didn't accept you. That's embarrassing.

487
00:39:37,700 --> 00:39:40,600
- Be quiet if you don't understand.
- That's...

488
00:39:42,030 --> 00:39:44,320
what criminals do.

489
00:39:54,740 --> 00:39:56,330
Lee Jun Ho.

490
00:39:58,180 --> 00:39:59,630
Watch what you say.

491
00:39:59,630 --> 00:40:02,940
"I became this bad because of you."

492
00:40:03,890 --> 00:40:06,550
That's how criminals think.

493
00:40:08,780 --> 00:40:11,460
Whom are you trying to lecture right now?

494
00:40:12,630 --> 00:40:14,910
I was once your teacher, too.

495
00:40:14,910 --> 00:40:18,850
I'm just a man here to warn the person who's...

496
00:40:19,880 --> 00:40:21,780
tormenting my girlfriend.

497
00:40:23,990 --> 00:40:26,500
I'm meeting with Assistant Director Wu.

498
00:40:27,460 --> 00:40:30,240
I wanted to know beforehand.

499
00:40:30,240 --> 00:40:34,630
Yun Ji Seok and Wu Seung Hui only teamed up a few days ago.

500
00:40:34,630 --> 00:40:36,940
How loyal is he to her?

501
00:40:36,940 --> 00:40:41,640
How quickly will he tell her about what happened this morning?

502
00:40:41,640 --> 00:40:43,540
How serious is Yun Ji Seok...

503
00:40:46,380 --> 00:40:49,880
about wanting to destroy Seo Hye Jin?

504
00:40:54,900 --> 00:40:56,980
I understand it now.

505
00:40:58,080 --> 00:40:59,480
Yes.

506
00:41:05,380 --> 00:41:08,020
 Daechi Chase 

507
00:41:45,660 --> 00:41:47,310
It's Mr. Lee.

508
00:41:48,120 --> 00:41:50,600
- Min Ji, take this for a second. 
 - Go ahead.

509
00:41:50,600 --> 00:41:52,710
- I'll wait.
 - Okay.

510
00:41:58,810 --> 00:42:00,260
Where are you going?

511
00:42:00,260 --> 00:42:01,680
Hey.

512
00:42:03,930 --> 00:42:05,920
I'm meeting someone for lunch.

513
00:42:05,920 --> 00:42:07,650
Who?

514
00:42:09,460 --> 00:42:11,550
Assistant Director Wu.

515
00:42:11,550 --> 00:42:14,370
Don't do that. With your temper...

516
00:42:22,410 --> 00:42:24,230
I told you.

517
00:42:38,430 --> 00:42:40,440
I know you're scared.

518
00:42:40,440 --> 00:42:41,970
What do you mean scared?

519
00:42:41,970 --> 00:42:45,270
What happened with Mr. Pyo and Choeseon Korean.

520
00:42:45,270 --> 00:42:50,270
You must feel like everything you planned is coming back to attack you like a boomerang.

521
00:42:50,270 --> 00:42:53,590
You've probably never been publicly criticized like this, either.

522
00:42:54,430 --> 00:42:56,910
That's why you're discouraged. I see that.

523
00:42:56,910 --> 00:43:02,810
So eat well and teach well for now.

524
00:43:03,790 --> 00:43:07,110
You haven't told me about Team Leader Lee yet, either.

525
00:43:07,110 --> 00:43:09,180
I'll report to you when I come back.

526
00:43:10,820 --> 00:43:12,440
By the way,

527
00:43:16,410 --> 00:43:19,380
this is kind of hurtful.

528
00:43:24,480 --> 00:43:26,180
I'll be back.

529
00:43:47,750 --> 00:43:49,510
Yes.

530
00:43:51,450 --> 00:43:53,300
- Hello.
 - Hi.

531
00:44:09,590 --> 00:44:12,410
I came on time. Did you wait long?

532
00:44:12,410 --> 00:44:14,420
No.

533
00:44:14,420 --> 00:44:16,340
I came early.

534
00:44:16,340 --> 00:44:19,630
I was excited to see you.

535
00:44:19,630 --> 00:44:21,620
Thank you for inviting me.

536
00:44:21,620 --> 00:44:26,210
Don't mention it. You sent the invitation first.

537
00:44:27,350 --> 00:44:29,830
You should've just contacted me if you wanted to see me.

538
00:44:29,830 --> 00:44:32,670
Instead of using Lee Myeong Jun.

539
00:44:32,670 --> 00:44:35,880
I thought it was likely you wouldn't see me.

540
00:44:37,410 --> 00:44:39,000
Gosh, why?

541
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:42,930
Because you probably didn't find me useful.

542
00:44:42,930 --> 00:44:45,860
Since I'm just a kid who follows Seo Hye Jin around.

543
00:44:45,860 --> 00:44:48,590
You must've felt a bit guilty, too,

544
00:44:48,590 --> 00:44:51,310
because of what you've done to Ms. Seo.

545
00:44:53,180 --> 00:44:55,780
I wanted to assert my presence...

546
00:44:55,780 --> 00:44:58,910
and check how loyal Lee Myeong Jun and Yun Ji Seok are, too.

547
00:44:58,910 --> 00:45:02,260
That's why I'm going through the trouble.

548
00:45:02,260 --> 00:45:06,800
You aren't actually interested in teaming up with Lee Myeong Jun?

549
00:45:06,800 --> 00:45:08,510
That's just my wish.

550
00:45:08,510 --> 00:45:12,300
It'd be difficult because you're my opponent.

551
00:45:16,200 --> 00:45:18,460
How blindingly shiny.

552
00:45:18,460 --> 00:45:22,230
Gosh, I'm almost feeling jealous.

553
00:45:23,020 --> 00:45:24,830
Me?

554
00:45:24,830 --> 00:45:28,720
It's your youth, to be exact.

555
00:45:28,720 --> 00:45:32,050
Love gives you energy, doesn't it?

556
00:45:32,050 --> 00:45:33,510
Yes.

557
00:45:34,520 --> 00:45:37,860
How youthful, sweet, and vigorous.

558
00:45:37,860 --> 00:45:40,340
Instead, you're experienced.

559
00:45:40,340 --> 00:45:43,430
You're intelligent and shrewd, too.

560
00:45:43,430 --> 00:45:45,310
Thank you.

561
00:45:48,720 --> 00:45:50,440
Well...

562
00:45:51,830 --> 00:45:54,520
so instead of doing this,

563
00:45:56,160 --> 00:45:59,250
wouldn't it be better if you went independent cleanly?

564
00:46:00,950 --> 00:46:04,510
Is that why you wanted to see me?

565
00:46:04,510 --> 00:46:06,270
To give me advice?

566
00:46:06,270 --> 00:46:08,400
I'm begging you.

567
00:46:08,400 --> 00:46:11,420
The academy is more dear to me than my alma mater.

568
00:46:12,940 --> 00:46:15,580
I don't think I can help you

569
00:46:15,580 --> 00:46:17,790
since this is between the elders.

570
00:46:17,790 --> 00:46:21,340
Don't you want respect or support from the juniors?

571
00:46:23,090 --> 00:46:29,960
How about you care for and support your significant other more?

572
00:46:31,770 --> 00:46:36,040
Seo Hye Jin looks like she'd break if you hit her.

573
00:46:36,040 --> 00:46:41,810
How much longer will you make her wrestle the students day and night?

574
00:46:42,870 --> 00:46:44,800
To save her family,

575
00:46:44,800 --> 00:46:48,970
she gave up on everything she wanted and devoted herself to work.

576
00:46:48,970 --> 00:46:53,080
When she finally caught a break, she almost reached her life expectancy as an academy teacher.

577
00:46:53,080 --> 00:46:57,600
She's not as fit physically or quick in her head anymore.

578
00:46:58,520 --> 00:47:02,110
If you're a proper man, shouldn't you become successful quickly

579
00:47:02,110 --> 00:47:06,460
and be responsible for the one you love?

580
00:47:08,630 --> 00:47:11,110
You didn't know this, did you?

581
00:47:11,110 --> 00:47:16,590
I gave you the highest score for your demo lecture.

582
00:47:16,590 --> 00:47:18,030
Pardon?

583
00:47:18,030 --> 00:47:21,740
Your age, educational background, and potential. I highly valued all of that.

584
00:47:21,740 --> 00:47:24,490
The fact that you're ambitious, too.

585
00:47:27,460 --> 00:47:31,970
It's a pity to leave you there.

586
00:47:34,850 --> 00:47:39,230
Didn't you call me too late, then?

587
00:47:40,610 --> 00:47:46,540
To be honest, I thought it'd be a waste of time to persuade you,

588
00:47:46,540 --> 00:47:49,830
but I'm tempted since you had the guts to come here.

589
00:47:50,740 --> 00:47:52,190
Try joining me.

590
00:47:52,190 --> 00:47:56,390
I know you have a big goal.

591
00:47:58,620 --> 00:48:02,430
Director Choi probably wouldn't like me because of the Huiwon High incident.

592
00:48:02,430 --> 00:48:05,580
I'll persuade her, of course.

593
00:48:12,680 --> 00:48:14,920
I'll take my coat off.

594
00:48:14,920 --> 00:48:17,250
Yes, go ahead.

595
00:48:25,600 --> 00:48:27,890
Are you sure you don't know?

596
00:48:27,890 --> 00:48:29,810
You weren't controlling in the back or anything?

597
00:48:29,810 --> 00:48:33,550
What did Mr. Lee email you exactly?

598
00:48:33,550 --> 00:48:36,120
Are you sure you didn't plot this together?

599
00:48:36,120 --> 00:48:37,970
Team Leader.

600
00:48:41,190 --> 00:48:44,810
His class and textbook material.

601
00:48:44,810 --> 00:48:47,160
Although it won't be so useful to me.

602
00:48:56,090 --> 00:48:58,200
Wh-Why did he do that?

603
00:48:59,280 --> 00:49:01,530
Why would you ask me that?

604
00:49:05,990 --> 00:49:08,690
He's probably trying to team up with me.

605
00:49:10,520 --> 00:49:12,440
Whoa.

606
00:49:12,440 --> 00:49:14,970
I'll go back downstairs.

607
00:49:16,420 --> 00:49:20,240
I mean... but why would he...

608
00:49:39,700 --> 00:49:42,160
I'll have to stay alert.

609
00:49:43,750 --> 00:49:50,020
I just realized why people join your side after they meet with you.

610
00:49:50,020 --> 00:49:51,520
I'm persuasive, right?

611
00:49:51,520 --> 00:49:57,990
Yes. Especially the "proper man" part. Whoa...

612
00:49:57,990 --> 00:50:00,510
It was so moving.

613
00:50:01,860 --> 00:50:06,060
Don't be sarcastic when you talk to your elders. Fix that.

614
00:50:06,060 --> 00:50:09,810
I can see why your old Victory Academy failed, too.

615
00:50:11,560 --> 00:50:14,350
There's no need to get into what we both know.

616
00:50:14,350 --> 00:50:16,560
I don't think you know.

617
00:50:16,560 --> 00:50:20,590
It's not about Kim Hyeon Tak buying it cheaply or anything like that.

618
00:50:21,820 --> 00:50:26,520
Because you'd never become a good teacher in a million years.

619
00:50:26,520 --> 00:50:29,890
That's why you failed with Victory.

620
00:50:29,890 --> 00:50:31,930
You sure are young.

621
00:50:31,930 --> 00:50:34,160
Why speak of being a good teacher in this situation?

622
00:50:34,160 --> 00:50:38,230
If you're a proper man, give your woman silver and gold.

623
00:50:38,230 --> 00:50:40,430
Whether you partner with thieves,

624
00:50:40,430 --> 00:50:43,230
the rat who spread a nasty rumor,

625
00:50:43,230 --> 00:50:46,830
or make innocent people lose their jobs. Just do it.

626
00:50:46,830 --> 00:50:50,470
What could you have to offer when you say such bullshit?

627
00:50:51,560 --> 00:50:53,970
You probably had nothing but flies swarm.

628
00:50:55,940 --> 00:50:58,850
- Be gentlemanly.
 - I'm sure you...

629
00:50:58,850 --> 00:51:03,370
ran away without looking back once the academy started suffering.

630
00:51:03,370 --> 00:51:04,780
That's why it failed.

631
00:51:04,780 --> 00:51:08,570
Can you... stop saying I failed?

632
00:51:08,570 --> 00:51:10,630
I'm saying that on purpose.

633
00:51:11,570 --> 00:51:14,870
You'll fail in the future for the same reason you failed in the past.

634
00:51:17,710 --> 00:51:19,900
Can't believe you're the one Seo Hye Jin carefully selected—

635
00:51:19,900 --> 00:51:22,420
I'm a pathetic child.

636
00:51:23,290 --> 00:51:26,100
Did you tell Yun Ji Seok that, too?

637
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:34,900
How could people who are persuaded that way be helpful to your future?

638
00:51:34,900 --> 00:51:38,990
Even Lee Myeong Jun started considering running away already.

639
00:51:58,140 --> 00:52:03,600
You must've gotten emotional since you've been facing some hardship.

640
00:52:03,600 --> 00:52:07,890
You shouldn't make decisions when you're riled up, okay?

641
00:52:07,890 --> 00:52:12,460
Go back and try to reflect on your actions calmly.

642
00:52:13,090 --> 00:52:14,790
Reflect?

643
00:52:15,650 --> 00:52:17,280
Me?

644
00:52:18,120 --> 00:52:20,260
But ...

645
00:52:20,260 --> 00:52:23,890
Did I steal someone else's class material or spread a rumor that

646
00:52:23,890 --> 00:52:26,060
you're playing around with young male teachers—

647
00:52:26,060 --> 00:52:28,170
Are you crazy?

648
00:52:28,170 --> 00:52:30,060
Are you offended?

649
00:52:33,670 --> 00:52:37,040
That's what Ms. Seo is going through right now.

650
00:52:37,820 --> 00:52:40,250
Can you understand even half of it?

651
00:52:41,650 --> 00:52:46,100
She's trying not to stoop that low even while enduring all that.

652
00:52:46,100 --> 00:52:49,950
That means she's a much better teacher than you are.

653
00:52:50,590 --> 00:52:54,630
She'll end up with people, not flies, in the end.

654
00:52:54,630 --> 00:52:58,840
And... you'll fail once again.

655
00:52:58,840 --> 00:53:02,580
Yes. Go ahead and try.

656
00:53:02,580 --> 00:53:06,590
You learn some things by experiencing them directly. Yes!

657
00:53:06,590 --> 00:53:10,460
Learn how the adult world operates.

658
00:53:10,460 --> 00:53:14,340
You're the one who should learn from experience. Please.

659
00:53:15,630 --> 00:53:18,150
Don't fail the same way.

660
00:53:18,150 --> 00:53:20,270
Eat alone.

661
00:53:22,050 --> 00:53:26,010
You won't fail if you start small, even now.

662
00:53:31,890 --> 00:53:34,980
Hold on, Hold on, Hold on.

663
00:53:39,600 --> 00:53:41,340
Take this with you.

664
00:53:42,600 --> 00:53:45,710
Use it to make yourself look intelligent.

665
00:53:45,710 --> 00:53:47,690
It looks important.

666
00:56:09,980 --> 00:56:13,980
 Assistant Director Wu Seung Hui 

667
00:56:17,140 --> 00:56:19,140
 I'm in a class. 

668
00:56:21,590 --> 00:56:24,530
Does he think I'm stupid?

669
00:56:40,410 --> 00:56:42,890
So cold.

670
00:56:45,830 --> 00:56:47,320
Gosh.

671
00:56:49,360 --> 00:56:50,760
Gosh.

672
00:56:53,160 --> 00:56:55,070
Hey, Jun Ho.

673
00:56:58,570 --> 00:57:00,650
What are you doing here?

674
00:57:02,350 --> 00:57:04,510
Are you sick?

675
00:57:04,510 --> 00:57:09,930
No, I just stopped by to take a shower.

676
00:57:09,930 --> 00:57:12,790
Why would you take a shower here?

677
00:57:12,790 --> 00:57:14,260
I got sweaty.

678
00:57:14,260 --> 00:57:15,990
What?

679
00:57:17,310 --> 00:57:18,980
You don't feel hot.

680
00:57:18,980 --> 00:57:21,730
There was a situation.

681
00:57:21,730 --> 00:57:23,690
Mom, I'll take a shower first.

682
00:57:23,690 --> 00:57:25,190
Okay.

683
00:57:38,760 --> 00:57:40,500
I'll go now.

684
00:57:40,500 --> 00:57:43,080
Already? Aren't you going to eat?

685
00:57:43,080 --> 00:57:45,300
I need to go. I just stopped by briefly.

686
00:57:46,100 --> 00:57:47,310
Sit down for a second.

687
00:57:47,310 --> 00:57:49,700
Mom, I don't have time. I need to go.

688
00:57:52,680 --> 00:57:54,800
Will you keep acting like this?

689
00:57:54,800 --> 00:57:58,820
Do you want me to flip out on Seo Hye Jin?

690
00:58:02,480 --> 00:58:04,120
Go.

691
00:58:05,950 --> 00:58:07,760
Mom.

692
00:58:07,760 --> 00:58:11,270
You said you don't have time. Go.

693
00:58:21,540 --> 00:58:23,740
What's this?

694
00:58:23,740 --> 00:58:26,710
I heard there are some good movies out these days.

695
00:58:26,710 --> 00:58:29,190
Let's go see one on my day off.

696
00:58:30,460 --> 00:58:34,000
I'll treat you to the hotel brunch you liked last time.

697
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:35,340
What?

698
00:58:35,340 --> 00:58:38,420
I'll eat the dinner you made, watch TV with you,

699
00:58:38,420 --> 00:58:40,420
and sleep over.

700
00:58:40,420 --> 00:58:45,050
I'll prep beansprouts and go on a walk with you, too.

701
00:58:46,540 --> 00:58:50,790
I know you want to talk to me and be with me.

702
00:58:51,910 --> 00:58:54,520
I'm sorry I've been bratty.

703
00:58:55,520 --> 00:58:57,180
What are you plotting now?

704
00:58:57,180 --> 00:59:01,220
I'm not plotting. I just want to.

705
00:59:05,520 --> 00:59:07,090
By the way, Mom...

706
00:59:07,090 --> 00:59:08,380
What?

707
00:59:08,380 --> 00:59:11,300
Ms. Seo taught me all this.

708
00:59:11,300 --> 00:59:13,750
Seriously...

709
00:59:13,750 --> 00:59:15,190
Go easy on her.

710
00:59:15,190 --> 00:59:18,860
- Okay, okay... 
- I didn't hit you enough then. Seriously.

711
00:59:18,860 --> 00:59:22,220
Gosh, seriously.

712
00:59:35,910 --> 00:59:38,020
You'll eat all this?

713
00:59:38,020 --> 00:59:40,340
I skipped lunch.

714
00:59:43,740 --> 00:59:46,680
Wu Seung Hui didn't even buy you lunch?

715
00:59:46,680 --> 00:59:49,030
We lose our appetite with each other.

716
00:59:52,410 --> 00:59:54,150
Well...

717
00:59:54,150 --> 00:59:58,180
What did you talk about without eating lunch?

718
00:59:58,180 --> 01:00:00,520
I told her I could see why she failed...

719
01:00:00,520 --> 01:00:01,950
and that she'll fail again.

720
01:00:01,950 --> 01:00:03,500
What?

721
01:00:06,720 --> 01:00:10,700
I tried to be polite, but I changed my mind.

722
01:00:10,700 --> 01:00:12,220
Why?

723
01:00:15,230 --> 01:00:18,390
Because she seemed to be having fun.

724
01:00:22,510 --> 01:00:26,530
I understand why people find it fun to walk all over us.

725
01:00:26,530 --> 01:00:29,310
The entrance exam is freaking boring, and the future is bleak.

726
01:00:29,310 --> 01:00:31,070
They don't care about the truth.

727
01:00:31,070 --> 01:00:33,720
Not to mention the ethics of an academy teacher.

728
01:00:34,520 --> 01:00:38,870
They just want to make things more sensational and dirty.

729
01:00:38,870 --> 01:00:41,700
It's so fun to see someone successful failing, too.

730
01:00:41,700 --> 01:00:43,950
That's hurtful.

731
01:00:43,950 --> 01:00:45,960
Don't speak so harshly.

732
01:00:45,960 --> 01:00:47,410
I'm sorry.

733
01:00:49,850 --> 01:00:52,280
But Wu Seung Hui can't do that.

734
01:00:53,080 --> 01:00:56,000
She snickers while seducing people.

735
01:01:00,260 --> 01:01:03,690
People will forget about us as time goes by.

736
01:01:03,690 --> 01:01:06,570
Some mothers will send their students to us again.

737
01:01:06,570 --> 01:01:11,110
They think they have the right since they pay us.

738
01:01:11,110 --> 01:01:15,820
"I destroyed you, but you can't ignore my demands."

739
01:01:15,820 --> 01:01:18,280
Yes. As you said, when time goes by—

740
01:01:18,280 --> 01:01:22,300
I'm not interested in waiting for time to pass.

741
01:01:23,930 --> 01:01:30,050
I'll prove that you're a very clean person.

742
01:01:41,590 --> 01:01:44,420
How about your skyscraper in Gangnam?

743
01:01:45,200 --> 01:01:47,790
Didn't your goal become too small?

744
01:01:47,790 --> 01:01:51,120
If I can't even fix my relationship, I don't get to have a room,

745
01:01:51,120 --> 01:01:53,300
not to mention a skyscraper.

746
01:01:55,470 --> 01:01:57,520
What can I do?

747
01:02:02,400 --> 01:02:05,730
This. Make sure to finish the whole thing.

748
01:02:06,510 --> 01:02:07,900
And?

749
01:02:08,580 --> 01:02:10,780
Let me eat the rest of this.

750
01:02:29,880 --> 01:02:32,710
- On my face again? 
 - It's already all over your face.

751
01:02:38,260 --> 01:02:41,190
Gosh, why am I nervous about this?

752
01:02:45,570 --> 01:02:47,850
I'm giving you a pass.

753
01:02:47,850 --> 01:02:52,040
I was going to hold grudges against you for running away in front of the students.

754
01:03:02,800 --> 01:03:06,130
I'll stop by the bookstore to pick up some textbooks.

755
01:03:37,000 --> 01:03:39,180
It's quite spacious.

756
01:03:39,180 --> 01:03:43,160
First of all, the prior tenant was very clean.

757
01:03:43,160 --> 01:03:46,580
So, the apartment is in great condition.

758
01:04:39,850 --> 01:04:43,260
Was our academy involved in what happened?

759
01:04:46,460 --> 01:04:50,500
Since Ms. Seo is a woman.

760
01:04:51,550 --> 01:04:55,590
I suppose you felt careful talking about it

761
01:04:55,590 --> 01:04:58,020
since the rumors were too raunchy.

762
01:05:01,460 --> 01:05:04,250
Did Director Choi not care?

763
01:05:05,150 --> 01:05:07,180
She won't let me ask questions.

764
01:05:07,180 --> 01:05:11,090
Saying she won't discuss how she runs the academy with anyone.

765
01:05:14,550 --> 01:05:17,910
When you said you'd be joining Choeseon Korean,

766
01:05:18,500 --> 01:05:21,420
Ms. Seo told me that...

767
01:05:22,360 --> 01:05:26,930
she'd like to give you her students if she could.

768
01:05:28,420 --> 01:05:30,890
She was angry at Director Choi,

769
01:05:30,890 --> 01:05:35,900
but she was relieved that the students would be joining you.

770
01:05:35,900 --> 01:05:39,040
That's probably what Ms. Seo is thinking.

771
01:05:41,720 --> 01:05:43,270
How does that make sense?

772
01:05:43,270 --> 01:05:47,420
They're probably everything she has.

773
01:05:47,420 --> 01:05:49,060
Don't worry.

774
01:05:49,060 --> 01:05:51,940
I'm doing my best trying to get them back.

775
01:06:03,540 --> 01:06:05,410
It's nothing.

776
01:06:05,410 --> 01:06:07,820
You should go to your class.

777
01:06:07,820 --> 01:06:09,400
Yes.

778
01:06:26,380 --> 01:06:30,970
Min Ji, I'll take a yellow one.

779
01:06:33,660 --> 01:06:35,030
My order hasn't arrived yet.

780
01:06:35,030 --> 01:06:37,030
No, you can't.

781
01:06:37,640 --> 01:06:39,800
But you have two.

782
01:06:39,800 --> 01:06:42,430
I need a lot of yellow ones today.

783
01:06:42,430 --> 01:06:43,960
Will you be teaching?

784
01:06:43,960 --> 01:06:46,670
I can tell from the class material.

785
01:06:47,500 --> 01:06:49,760
How about the purple one, then?

786
01:06:50,460 --> 01:06:52,080
Mr. Jang,

787
01:06:53,150 --> 01:06:55,730
I have a ledger for this.

788
01:06:57,350 --> 01:07:01,710
- Ledger? 
 - I kept track of all of Ms. Seo's chalks you've been taking.

789
01:07:01,710 --> 01:07:04,620
You always take the expensive ones.

790
01:07:04,620 --> 01:07:07,030
When did I only take the expensive ones...

791
01:07:08,380 --> 01:07:10,770
Did Team Leader Seo tell you to do this?

792
01:07:10,770 --> 01:07:15,440
No, but if you take one again, I'll tell her.

793
01:07:15,440 --> 01:07:17,320
Min Ji, this is for all of us—

794
01:07:17,320 --> 01:07:20,390
- Hi.
 - Hello.

795
01:07:21,670 --> 01:07:23,630
Okay, Min Ji. Carry on.

796
01:07:23,630 --> 01:07:26,340
- Okay. 
- Bye.

797
01:07:26,340 --> 01:07:27,830
Ms. Min Ji.

798
01:07:28,590 --> 01:07:31,380
Ms. Min Ji, I forgot my textbook.

799
01:07:33,980 --> 01:07:35,420
Here.

800
01:07:37,570 --> 01:07:38,820
Thank you.

801
01:07:38,820 --> 01:07:41,290
- Don't forget it next time. 
- Okay.

802
01:07:45,870 --> 01:07:49,540
 Assistant Director Wu Seung Hui 

803
01:07:56,620 --> 01:07:59,490
 Assistant Director Wu Seung Hui 

804
01:07:59,490 --> 01:08:03,070
They say you can't be generous if you don't have anything.

805
01:08:03,070 --> 01:08:05,630
They might look okay on the outside,

806
01:08:05,630 --> 01:08:10,880
but you can tell when a family is about to fall apart.

807
01:08:11,470 --> 01:08:13,550
What are you talking about?

808
01:08:15,720 --> 01:08:17,280
It's nothing.

809
01:08:21,640 --> 01:08:24,730
It's just a piece of chalk. How stingy.

810
01:08:36,810 --> 01:08:38,690
Assistant Director?

811
01:08:38,690 --> 01:08:42,160
Hey, Min Ji.

812
01:08:42,160 --> 01:08:44,810
Long time no talk.

813
01:08:44,810 --> 01:08:49,170
I'm thinking of going to Mok-dong since there's an opening.

814
01:08:49,170 --> 01:08:51,110
Mok-dong?

815
01:08:51,110 --> 01:08:52,780
Mok-dong is nice.

816
01:08:52,780 --> 01:08:55,950
But not Wu Seung Hui?

817
01:08:55,950 --> 01:08:59,140
I'll make connections here and there for now.

818
01:08:59,140 --> 01:09:00,910
How about you?

819
01:09:03,270 --> 01:09:06,650
I'll talk to the Director first.

820
01:09:08,190 --> 01:09:12,270
I'm a team leader, you know. I feel guilty to just leave.

821
01:09:16,250 --> 01:09:18,460
I thought Ms. Kim didn't have a class today.

822
01:09:18,460 --> 01:09:19,850
Right.

823
01:09:22,380 --> 01:09:26,450
 She said she won't discuss how she runs the academy with anyone. 

824
01:09:33,000 --> 01:09:36,180
I hope you think more carefully.

825
01:09:39,750 --> 01:09:42,870
According to the consultation office, your class is still secure—

826
01:09:42,870 --> 01:09:46,880
I'll finish the class by the end of the month.

827
01:09:49,810 --> 01:09:53,000
The director is looking for a solution, too.

828
01:09:53,000 --> 01:09:56,270
It wasn't an easy decision.

829
01:09:56,270 --> 01:09:58,330
I'm sorry.

830
01:10:04,760 --> 01:10:07,200
 I just want to have a meal with you. 

831
01:10:07,200 --> 01:10:09,470
 Does that make you very uncomfortable? 

832
01:10:10,770 --> 01:10:16,210
Did Assistant Director Wu promise you something?

833
01:10:16,210 --> 01:10:17,330
Wh-What do you mean...

834
01:10:17,330 --> 01:10:21,400
Did she promise you my files...

835
01:10:22,590 --> 01:10:25,040
for example?

836
01:10:26,770 --> 01:10:28,670
Did she say Seo Hye Jin...

837
01:10:30,450 --> 01:10:34,330
isn't just screwed but totally screwed?

838
01:10:34,330 --> 01:10:37,200
- Well—
 - Did she say this academy is

839
01:10:37,200 --> 01:10:42,150
totally, completely, entirely hopeless?

840
01:10:43,500 --> 01:10:44,960
Yes.

841
01:10:47,030 --> 01:10:50,790
So, she told everyone to escape for that reason.

842
01:11:05,980 --> 01:11:15,030


843
01:11:16,730 --> 01:11:19,120
♫  Open to page sixty-four  ♫

844
01:11:19,120 --> 01:11:21,800
♫  We'll study what came before  ♫

845
01:11:21,800 --> 01:11:26,170
♫  Books are binding, but there's so much more  ♫

846
01:11:26,170 --> 01:11:28,700
♫  This little schools just a race  ♫

847
01:11:28,700 --> 01:11:31,130
♫  But I can tell by your grace  ♫

848
01:11:31,130 --> 01:11:35,380
 The Midnight Romance in Hagwon 

849
01:11:35,380 --> 01:11:39,350
 I heard that you're in the worst situation now. 

850
01:11:39,350 --> 01:11:42,280
 There's a part-time position where you can get a scholarship. 

851
01:11:42,280 --> 01:11:43,860
 Do you want to go? 

852
01:11:43,860 --> 01:11:45,750
 I'm crazy. 

853
01:11:45,750 --> 01:11:47,160
 I'm out of my mind. 

854
01:11:47,160 --> 01:11:49,910
 What Choi Hyeong Seon really wants is Seo Hye Jin. 

855
01:11:49,910 --> 01:11:52,510
 Is that your idea, Lee Myeong Jun? 

856
01:11:52,510 --> 01:11:54,820
 Seo Hye Jin came, right? 

857
01:11:54,820 --> 01:11:56,050
 Ta-da. 

858
01:11:56,050 --> 01:11:58,760
 Will I be able to come back? 

859
01:11:58,760 --> 01:12:00,840
 How can I live with you forever at this rate? 

860
01:12:00,840 --> 01:12:03,340
 I can't imagine not having him by my side. 

861
01:12:03,340 --> 01:12:05,600
 I'll give you everything you ask for. 

862
