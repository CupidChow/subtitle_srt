7
00:00:56,289 --> 00:00:57,319
Yes.

8
00:00:57,459 --> 00:01:00,730
Lee Si Woo was absent today, so I gave him a call.

9
00:01:01,529 --> 00:01:03,160
Are you sure it was just him alone?

10
00:01:03,459 --> 00:01:05,370
Kids from other academies could have gone too.

11
00:01:05,469 --> 00:01:06,600
He said it was just him.

12
00:01:06,670 --> 00:01:08,969
He said it was supposed to last only two hours,

13
00:01:08,970 --> 00:01:10,169
but it lasted much longer than that.

14
00:01:12,809 --> 00:01:15,880
He stayed for the whole class after skipping my class?

15
00:01:17,479 --> 00:01:19,949
I'll ask him for more details next week before the class.

16
00:01:22,649 --> 00:01:24,619
I can't wait to hear from him...

17
00:01:24,789 --> 00:01:26,319
about their class.

00:01:33,530 --> 00:01:35,558
- I'll get going then. - Thank you for your help.

21
00:01:35,559 --> 00:01:36,559
- Sure. - Bye.

22
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:38,000
- Bye. - Goodnight.

23
00:01:49,809 --> 00:01:51,479
We still have stuff to discuss, right?

24
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:53,780
I thought the dizziness was going to be the end of me.

25
00:01:54,649 --> 00:01:55,679
Let's go for a walk.

26
00:01:59,449 --> 00:02:00,520
Hey.

27
00:02:00,819 --> 00:02:03,360
If you have nothing to do, why don't you help me with this?

28
00:02:03,959 --> 00:02:04,959
Hold on.

29
00:02:05,830 --> 00:02:07,860
I'm thinking about another man.

30
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:10,059
Who? Mr. Lee Jun Ho?

31
00:02:11,929 --> 00:02:13,199
Don't you find him a bit odd?

32
00:02:13,299 --> 00:02:14,400
What? What do you mean?

33
00:02:15,470 --> 00:02:16,769
To be precise,

34
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:19,009
when Hye Jin is with him,

35
00:02:19,739 --> 00:02:20,870
something feels off about her.

36
00:02:21,239 --> 00:02:22,340
What are you talking about?

37
00:02:23,910 --> 00:02:27,310
Oddly enough, she acts like her old self around him.

38
00:02:30,650 --> 00:02:31,949
That's possible.

39
00:02:32,190 --> 00:02:34,150
When people meet their friends from elementary school,

40
00:02:34,319 --> 00:02:35,919
they start acting like they're in elementary school.

41
00:02:36,319 --> 00:02:38,289
Around the people they served in the military together,

42
00:02:38,590 --> 00:02:40,259
they start talking as if they're in the military.

43
00:02:41,060 --> 00:02:43,060
I never served in the military.

44
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:45,530
Gosh. It was only an example. You know?

45
00:02:45,970 --> 00:02:47,699
Anyway, that's a thing with guys.

46
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,069
Is that so?

47
00:03:00,479 --> 00:03:01,579
Aren't you cold?

48
00:03:02,220 --> 00:03:03,680
No, I'm okay.

49
00:03:10,989 --> 00:03:12,090
What are you thinking about?

50
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:15,600
Si Woo.

51
00:03:18,030 --> 00:03:19,069
Me too.

52
00:03:21,569 --> 00:03:23,000
I wonder if he'll have a good impression of us.

53
00:03:24,739 --> 00:03:26,840
He'll remember our class for the rest of his life.

54
00:03:27,210 --> 00:03:28,340
How do you know that?

55
00:03:28,940 --> 00:03:30,280
I'm the living proof.

56
00:03:31,150 --> 00:03:32,650
Because I had never forgotten it.

57
00:03:37,049 --> 00:03:38,489
I do think it's not fair, though.

58
00:03:38,850 --> 00:03:39,919
Why?

59
00:03:40,620 --> 00:03:43,119
Compared to my 1st class with you, his 1st class with us...

60
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:45,729
was about two times better...

61
00:03:45,859 --> 00:03:49,199
because half of today's class was...

62
00:03:49,359 --> 00:03:50,799
conducted by me.

63
00:03:53,930 --> 00:03:55,269
Weren't you flustered?

64
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:58,639
We barely got to use half of the materials we prepared today.

65
00:03:59,210 --> 00:04:00,210
Not at all.

66
00:04:00,910 --> 00:04:03,539
But I was curious what went through your head at that moment.

67
00:04:03,910 --> 00:04:05,979
If it's difficult to explain, you don't have to.

68
00:04:07,380 --> 00:04:08,419
Oh, that?

69
00:04:14,019 --> 00:04:15,560
It was because my head went blank.

70
00:04:19,259 --> 00:04:20,590
The materials we prepared...

71
00:04:21,960 --> 00:04:23,358
I wondered if I should give him something else...

72
00:04:23,359 --> 00:04:25,129
than useful tips on how to get perfect scores.

73
00:04:25,570 --> 00:04:27,429
Initially, that random thought just crossed my mind.

74
00:04:29,169 --> 00:04:31,140
Then I found myself standing in front of the blackboard.

75
00:04:31,910 --> 00:04:35,510
At that moment, everything we prepared together disappeared.

76
00:04:36,580 --> 00:04:38,209
Everything like my secret tips...

77
00:04:38,210 --> 00:04:40,479
on how to get perfect scores and improve school grades.

78
00:04:41,820 --> 00:04:44,749
So I just thought about having fun with the reading materials.

79
00:04:45,450 --> 00:04:47,150
I was reminded of my first class with you.

80
00:04:47,789 --> 00:04:49,320
It felt somewhat similar to that day.

81
00:04:51,590 --> 00:04:53,460
Of course, Si Woo wasn't a dumbhead like you, though.

82
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:55,629
Gosh.

83
00:04:56,760 --> 00:04:58,530
I wasn't a dumbhead.

84
00:04:58,770 --> 00:05:00,770
I was just an undiscovered gem who had always been smart.

85
00:05:03,140 --> 00:05:06,609
Anyway, the academy will try to give me...

86
00:05:07,039 --> 00:05:08,979
as many disadvantages as possible.

87
00:05:09,210 --> 00:05:10,679
You should keep your distance from me.

88
00:05:11,249 --> 00:05:13,749
I don't care if people think we had a falling out because of this class.

89
00:05:14,379 --> 00:05:15,580
Don't come to work tomorrow.

90
00:05:18,789 --> 00:05:19,890
What if I don't want to do that?

91
00:05:20,590 --> 00:05:21,590
What?

92
00:05:21,820 --> 00:05:24,789
"I'll take care of the mess. You keep moving forward."

93
00:05:25,229 --> 00:05:27,590
I think you want to tell me something cool like that.

94
00:05:30,299 --> 00:05:31,330
No way.

95
00:05:31,669 --> 00:05:33,129
I'm fine.

96
00:05:33,499 --> 00:05:34,569
Although it happened a long time ago,

97
00:05:34,570 --> 00:05:36,039
I had some failed attempts too.

98
00:05:37,239 --> 00:05:39,939
Given my position, the academy can't come after me that easily.

99
00:05:40,239 --> 00:05:42,079
You know, I quit my office job...

100
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:44,009
and joined this academy, so I could quickly make...

101
00:05:44,010 --> 00:05:46,049
a lot more money than all of my superiors...

102
00:05:46,580 --> 00:05:48,150
at my previous company.

103
00:05:48,780 --> 00:05:51,219
If I was going to hide behind my superior to keep my job,

104
00:05:51,220 --> 00:05:52,650
I wouldn't have joined this industry.

105
00:05:54,489 --> 00:05:56,358
As your fellow instructor,

106
00:05:56,359 --> 00:05:57,659
I was part of this project.

107
00:05:57,660 --> 00:05:59,460
So I will take responsibility for the failure just as equally.

108
00:05:59,629 --> 00:06:00,629
Besides...

109
00:06:02,260 --> 00:06:05,070
Well, I got what I wanted all along.

110
00:06:06,729 --> 00:06:09,470
Yes. Our boss was definitely angry.

111
00:06:11,239 --> 00:06:12,309
Gosh.

112
00:06:13,470 --> 00:06:15,739
It's unfortunate that people will hear about our failure.

113
00:06:18,280 --> 00:06:20,410
But I'm happy that I got a lot of attention with my first class.

114
00:06:21,679 --> 00:06:23,548
There are two exams in each semester.

115
00:06:23,549 --> 00:06:24,689
We will always have more chances.

116
00:06:26,549 --> 00:06:27,549
You just focus on keeping...

117
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:29,320

118
00:06:29,689 --> 00:06:31,929

You can tell me about yesterday too.

00:07:09,299 --> 00:07:10,330
It's a full house.

129
00:07:10,499 --> 00:07:12,628
Take the USB flash drive from my laptop.

130
00:07:12,629 --> 00:07:14,700
Go and switch the slides with the ones on that flash drive.

131
00:07:16,039 --> 00:07:18,469
I already put up the slides you reviewed last.

132
00:07:18,470 --> 00:07:19,840

I'm sure you all remember this.

148

At the last midterm exam,

149
00:08:18,970 --> 00:08:21,340
this very phrase caused the students to retake the exam.

150
00:08:23,770 --> 00:08:26,570
I have a question for you.

151
00:08:27,539 --> 00:08:30,679
What's the most important exam for your children?

152
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:34,378
Their first midterm exam in high school...

153
00:08:34,379 --> 00:08:36,320
since it's the first exam that will count toward their school grades?

154
00:08:37,619 --> 00:08:39,549
Or their exams in the second year since those exams weigh more...

155
00:08:39,550 --> 00:08:40,648
in their student records?

156
00:08:40,649 --> 00:08:42,519
Or the university entrance exam?

157
00:08:45,029 --> 00:08:46,259
Those are all incorrect answers.

158
00:08:46,859 --> 00:08:47,889
The right answer is...

159
00:08:48,859 --> 00:08:50,899
(The upcoming exam)

160
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:54,570
The styles of exam questions change every exam.

161
00:08:54,899 --> 00:08:55,998
Whenever that happens,

162
00:08:55,999 --> 00:08:58,570
do you expect us to be clueless on how to handle the situation...

163
00:08:58,739 --> 00:09:00,810
and barge into schools?

164
00:09:01,479 --> 00:09:02,608
So we can argue with a schoolteacher...

165
00:09:02,609 --> 00:09:04,379
who will have to fill out your children's student records?

166
00:09:05,479 --> 00:09:08,018
The schoolteacher's pride was bruised,

167
00:09:08,019 --> 00:09:09,618
so he decided to change the direction of his questions.

168
00:09:09,619 --> 00:09:11,649
Was that really necessary at the risk of causing confusion?

169
00:09:13,050 --> 00:09:14,090
Your children...

170
00:09:15,090 --> 00:09:19,430
are much weaker than you think.

171
00:09:20,859 --> 00:09:23,029
They want to stay where they are because they're used to...

173
00:09:25,129 --> 00:09:27,529
Do not let them give up and be compliant.

174
00:09:30,100 --> 00:09:32,638
Until the moment they get into college,

175
00:09:32,639 --> 00:09:34,139
you must keep a tight rein on them.

176
00:09:38,749 --> 00:09:41,210
The White Haired Witch must have started her presentation.

177
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:44,580
You must have been disappointed by yesterday's event.

178
00:09:46,050 --> 00:09:47,050
I'm sorry.

179
00:09:47,290 --> 00:09:48,389
Don't mention it.

180
00:09:48,889 --> 00:09:50,590

00:09:55,859 --> 00:09:57,359
He performed better in an actual class.

183
00:09:57,700 --> 00:09:59,499
You proceeded with the class?

184
00:10:00,430 --> 00:10:02,200
Every student is important to us.

185
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:05,269
Good job.

186
00:10:06,409 --> 00:10:08,478
When that kind of diligent behaviour continues,

187
00:10:08,479 --> 00:10:10,040
it will improve our academy's image.

188
00:10:12,279 --> 00:10:14,550
I feel even worse hearing a compliment from you.

189
00:10:14,710 --> 00:10:15,820
Gosh, no.

190
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:17,278
I was worried you would be beating yourselves...

191
00:10:17,279 --> 00:10:18,550
with that negative thought.

192
00:10:18,690 --> 00:10:21,049
So I called you early in the morning on purpose.

193
00:10:21,050 --> 00:10:23,259
I thought meeting face-to-face would be better for everyone.

194
00:10:24,290 --> 00:10:26,888
We didn't get the result we wanted with students from Heewon High.

195
00:10:26,889 --> 00:10:27,929
But with students from Chanyoung High...

196
00:10:27,930 --> 00:10:29,800
You know what? This occasion...

197
00:10:30,330 --> 00:10:33,970
showed me an unexpected side of you, Ms. Seo.

198
00:10:35,899 --> 00:10:37,839
Trying your best to train Mr. Lee properly...

199
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:39,409
was such a selfless act from you.

200
00:10:40,070 --> 00:10:42,979
You weren't afraid of a countermove and went with a bold strategy.

201
00:10:43,279 --> 00:10:46,850
I didn't know that you were capable of doing this.

202
00:10:48,820 --> 00:10:51,989
On top of that, you guys finished your class...

203
00:10:52,149 --> 00:10:53,649
for just one student.

204
00:10:53,989 --> 00:10:55,560
Gosh. Seriously.

205
00:10:55,820 --> 00:10:57,618
What you did showed...

206
00:10:57,619 --> 00:10:59,789
an exemplary attitude for your junior instructor...

207
00:10:59,790 --> 00:11:00,859
to learn from.

208
00:11:01,659 --> 00:11:03,560
- That's... - Ms. Seo.

209
00:11:04,399 --> 00:11:07,830
You don't deserve to be chained to a small classroom like this.

210
00:11:10,070 --> 00:11:12,470
The second-year students from Chanyoung High?

211
00:11:14,070 --> 00:11:15,379
I thought you would be happy.

212
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:19,649
But I requested to teach the first-year students.

213
00:11:20,149 --> 00:11:22,979
My intention wasn't to take Ms. Seo's students.

214
00:11:23,119 --> 00:11:24,679
I wanted to gather my own students.

215
00:11:24,680 --> 00:11:26,720
So do you not want to teach them?

216
00:11:27,790 --> 00:11:30,518
Well, that's not what I was saying.

217
00:11:30,519 --> 00:11:34,029
How many second-year students do we have from Chanyoung High?

218
00:11:34,190 --> 00:11:36,700
A little over 80 students.

219
00:11:36,859 --> 00:11:38,629
- I don't know the exact number. - I see.

220
00:11:38,899 --> 00:11:42,369
If she splits them with Mr. Lee, it would be 40 students per class.

221
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:44,470
With Mr. Lee?

222
00:11:45,369 --> 00:11:48,180
Why? Do you want to take all 80 students?

223
00:11:49,310 --> 00:11:51,008
No. It's not that.

224
00:11:51,009 --> 00:11:52,779
If that's not it,

225
00:11:53,180 --> 00:11:56,018
are you disappointed that they will soon be seniors?

226
00:11:56,019 --> 00:11:57,479
Because they'll quit soon?

227
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:01,989
No.

228
00:12:03,159 --> 00:12:04,359
It's actually better.

229
00:12:04,690 --> 00:12:07,159
New instructors rarely get to teach seniors.

230
00:12:07,629 --> 00:12:08,859
In Daechi-dong,

231
00:12:09,499 --> 00:12:12,499
getting this kind of benefit in the beginning of your career...

232
00:12:13,369 --> 00:12:14,570
doesn't come often.

233
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:17,769
Right. Of course, I know that.

234
00:12:19,009 --> 00:12:21,540
I hope you will take the expectations we have...

235
00:12:21,639 --> 00:12:23,409
of you and Mr. Lee rather seriously.

236
00:12:24,210 --> 00:12:25,249
Okay.

237
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:30,080
Ms. Seo will help you a lot.

238
00:12:32,090 --> 00:12:33,920
I believe our Korean Department...

239
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:36,389
is the heart of our academy.

240
00:12:37,190 --> 00:12:39,690
I never doubted that for a second.

241
00:12:41,159 --> 00:12:42,629
When we acquired Victoria Academy,

242
00:12:42,830 --> 00:12:43,898
Vice-Director Woo Seung Hui's academy,

243
00:12:43,899 --> 00:12:46,129
our academy began teaching more subjects.

244
00:12:46,869 --> 00:12:48,069
But the Korean is the subject...

245
00:12:48,070 --> 00:12:50,369
that will continue the tradition of our academy.

246
00:12:50,700 --> 00:12:52,570
I always had that in my mind.

247
00:12:54,170 --> 00:12:55,180
Come to think of it,

248
00:12:55,609 --> 00:12:58,080
I invested a lot into the Korean Department.

249
00:12:58,379 --> 00:13:00,879
Starting with the advertisement, I tried my best to support...

250
00:13:01,149 --> 00:13:02,850
Korean instructors in every way possible.

251
00:13:03,479 --> 00:13:06,519
Thanks to that, you established your position at a young age.

252
00:13:07,519 --> 00:13:09,019
I'm grateful for that.

253
00:13:09,119 --> 00:13:10,190
Right.

254
00:13:10,859 --> 00:13:12,889
Despite everything, I always try...

255
00:13:13,389 --> 00:13:15,029
to introspect about myself...

256
00:13:15,399 --> 00:13:16,930
and look back on my actions.

257
00:13:18,499 --> 00:13:20,229
I ask myself this.

258
00:13:21,170 --> 00:13:25,470
"Am I being a good leader for the academy?"

259
00:13:26,340 --> 00:13:29,009
"Am I just being content with the stable sales?"

260
00:13:29,379 --> 00:13:31,879
"Am I wallowing in such lazy thoughts?"

261
00:13:37,180 --> 00:13:39,050
After fiercely reflecting on myself,

262
00:13:40,050 --> 00:13:42,290
I came to a conclusion.

263
00:13:43,420 --> 00:13:46,560
That it's not time for us to expand the size of the academy.

264
00:13:46,790 --> 00:13:49,029
Instead, we must improve the quality of our lectures.

265
00:13:50,499 --> 00:13:51,600
One more thing.

266
00:13:52,229 --> 00:13:53,628
I had been forgetting...

267
00:13:53,629 --> 00:13:56,769
that you were the perfect person for this task.

268
00:13:57,540 --> 00:13:58,940
I regretted being shortsighted about that too.

269
00:14:00,609 --> 00:14:01,879
Do you mean...

270
00:14:02,009 --> 00:14:04,340
It's proven that you give the best lectures.

271
00:14:04,609 --> 00:14:06,450
Now, it's time to broaden our horizon.

272
00:14:08,149 --> 00:14:10,979
Ms. Seo. Reduce the number of your lectures.

273
00:14:11,320 --> 00:14:13,649
Spearhead the preparation task force to set up the Gangbuk branch.

274
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:40,080
(Director's Office)

275
00:14:40,180 --> 00:14:41,180
Gosh.

276
00:14:43,450 --> 00:14:44,649
Did you understand what's happening?

277
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:46,920
No.

278
00:14:52,330 --> 00:14:53,330
Gosh.

279
00:14:56,229 --> 00:14:57,259
Oh, my.

280
00:15:00,670 --> 00:15:01,800
Goodness.

281
00:15:04,269 --> 00:15:05,570
What was he talking about?

282
00:15:05,869 --> 00:15:07,009
Where did this task force come from?

283
00:15:08,840 --> 00:15:10,040
There's no such thing.

284
00:15:10,340 --> 00:15:11,509
I bet no one else is in the task force.

285
00:15:12,310 --> 00:15:14,378
The vice-director will want to speak with you.

286
00:15:14,379 --> 00:15:15,550
So let me keep it simple.

287
00:15:16,019 --> 00:15:17,320
Why would she want to see me?

288
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:20,149
She will have you teach some of my classes.

289
00:15:21,619 --> 00:15:23,189
You'll probably teach second-year students...

290
00:15:23,190 --> 00:15:24,259
from Chanyoung High.

291
00:15:25,060 --> 00:15:26,090
What do you mean?

292
00:15:26,229 --> 00:15:27,858
They don't know how many first-year students...

293
00:15:27,859 --> 00:15:29,600
will switch over to Choisun Academy.

294
00:15:30,330 --> 00:15:32,599
I'm still confused. Why am I taking over your students?

295
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:34,330
So they can kick me out empty-handed.

296
00:15:35,700 --> 00:15:37,499
Just because the free lecture failed?

297
00:15:38,269 --> 00:15:41,409
No. They were probably looking for an excuse for a long time.

298
00:15:42,810 --> 00:15:44,709
Having an instructor like me is...

299
00:15:44,710 --> 00:15:46,009
a double-edged sword at academies.

300
00:15:47,009 --> 00:15:48,819
I can increase their sales by a lot.

301
00:15:48,820 --> 00:15:50,478
But if I were to quit and take my students somewhere else,

302
00:15:50,479 --> 00:15:52,050
the academy will be taking a huge hit.

303
00:15:52,619 --> 00:15:53,888
That's why...

304
00:15:53,889 --> 00:15:56,190
they were trying to come up with a way to split the students slowly.

305
00:15:58,159 --> 00:16:00,229
"Demotions are often disguised as honourable positions."

306
00:16:03,229 --> 00:16:04,560
It's good that you're catching on fast.

307
00:16:06,769 --> 00:16:09,100
So it means you...

308
00:16:12,509 --> 00:16:14,139
Your career is ruined because of me, right?

309
00:16:18,710 --> 00:16:19,749
Excuse me.

310
00:16:20,249 --> 00:16:22,320
(Vice-Director Woo Seung Hui)

311
00:16:23,119 --> 00:16:24,149
Answer it.

312
00:16:49,779 --> 00:16:52,479
You said you guys just hung out last weekend after the academy.

313
00:16:53,350 --> 00:16:55,749
We did after finishing all the homework.

314
00:16:56,550 --> 00:16:57,649
You traitors.

315
00:17:01,019 --> 00:17:02,759
I'm so busy. Who's calling me?

316
00:17:02,989 --> 00:17:04,019
Your mom.

317
00:17:07,029 --> 00:17:08,060
Hey, Mom.

318
00:17:09,429 --> 00:17:10,800
Of course, I'm on a break now.

319
00:17:10,959 --> 00:17:12,199
Didn't you know that when you called?

320
00:17:15,369 --> 00:17:16,369
I see.

321
00:17:17,169 --> 00:17:18,570
Was the presentation interesting?

322
00:17:21,409 --> 00:17:22,409
What?

323
00:17:23,939 --> 00:17:25,350
Mom, don't do that.

324
00:17:26,379 --> 00:17:27,909
Don't sign up there on the spot.

325
00:17:28,820 --> 00:17:29,820
What?

326
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:32,719
No.

327
00:17:34,419 --> 00:17:36,689
Ms. Seo's class is fine.

328
00:17:40,590 --> 00:17:42,129
You don't know anything, Mom.

329
00:17:45,570 --> 00:17:46,669
Well,

330
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:49,398
we should start making draft questions...

331
00:17:49,399 --> 00:17:50,699
for the final exam pretty soon.

332
00:17:51,699 --> 00:17:52,709
Yes.

333
00:17:54,510 --> 00:17:55,579
You told your students...

334
00:17:55,580 --> 00:17:58,810
that you would only draw questions from the textbook.

335
00:18:00,050 --> 00:18:01,080
I did.

336
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:06,050
Is there a problem with that?

337
00:18:10,159 --> 00:18:13,030
Realistically speaking, I don't think that's doable.

338
00:18:15,230 --> 00:18:16,699
What do you mean?

339
00:18:17,100 --> 00:18:18,199
I'm sure you know why.

340
00:18:18,770 --> 00:18:20,830
Those questions will be hard to assess the students' levels.

341
00:18:22,770 --> 00:18:23,800
Right.

342
00:18:24,340 --> 00:18:25,810
The level of their education is way too high.

343
00:18:26,669 --> 00:18:29,009
In the end, we'll have to deduct points based on the periods...

344
00:18:29,010 --> 00:18:30,510
and commas from the essay questions.

345
00:18:33,709 --> 00:18:35,679
It will be so chaotic during the grading period.

346
00:18:38,990 --> 00:18:40,389
Could you see it from our point of view?

347
00:18:41,490 --> 00:18:43,459
The teacher evaluation will begin soon too.

348
00:18:45,119 --> 00:18:46,159
Please?

349
00:18:48,260 --> 00:18:51,000
I'm looking for a way too.

350
00:18:52,500 --> 00:18:55,299
Sir, you can't base the questions on the after-school class...

351
00:18:55,300 --> 00:18:56,869
you're conducting now...

352
00:18:57,340 --> 00:18:59,169
because not everyone is taking the class.

353
00:19:01,740 --> 00:19:02,980
In the end,

354
00:19:04,310 --> 00:19:06,409
teachers like us will be collateral damage.

355
00:19:08,010 --> 00:19:09,050
Please?

356
00:19:21,389 --> 00:19:22,959
No, Mom. Don't you know better by now?

357
00:19:23,230 --> 00:19:24,760
Do you believe everything the academy director tells you?

358
00:19:26,030 --> 00:19:28,669
Why are you feeling excited right now?

359
00:19:37,139 --> 00:19:38,139
Given your skill sets,

360
00:19:38,140 --> 00:19:40,209
I have no doubt you'll lead them without losing any students.

361
00:19:40,879 --> 00:19:42,749
If you need more materials, do let me know.

362
00:19:42,750 --> 00:19:44,649
Let me go over my notes for the students first.

363
00:19:46,389 --> 00:19:47,419
Well,

364
00:19:48,090 --> 00:19:50,060
this isn't what I intended.

365
00:19:50,359 --> 00:19:51,419
I know that.

366
00:19:54,189 --> 00:19:56,199
- Ms. Seo. - Yes.

367
00:19:57,300 --> 00:19:58,458
Because you have a lot of students,

368
00:19:58,459 --> 00:19:59,698
they're afraid you might take them elsewhere,

369
00:19:59,699 --> 00:20:01,070
so they're destroying your career proactively.

370
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:05,100
I know very well that this happens often in this industry,

371
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:10,080
but shouldn't you protest this, at least?

372
00:20:11,939 --> 00:20:14,449
I'm still fine, aren't I?

373
00:20:16,619 --> 00:20:17,679
No, but...

374
00:20:18,889 --> 00:20:20,749
It would've been one thing for them to give me the 10th graders,

375
00:20:20,750 --> 00:20:22,658
since I know Mr. Pyo Sang Sub and all.

376
00:20:22,659 --> 00:20:24,089
And we could stop the attack from Choisun Academy too.

377
00:20:24,090 --> 00:20:25,959
That's why they didn't give you the 10th graders.

378
00:20:26,060 --> 00:20:27,990
So that the two of you could stay safely out of the way.

379
00:20:29,800 --> 00:20:32,270
Oh, I have something I want to ask you, Ms. Nam.

380
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:34,070
Yes, go ahead.

381
00:20:34,899 --> 00:20:36,600
Mr. Pyo Sung Sub who teaches 10th grade.

382
00:20:37,399 --> 00:20:39,609
Could he make the exam a cumulative one?

383
00:20:40,709 --> 00:20:41,969
You mean...

384
00:20:42,510 --> 00:20:44,879
will he include the whole year's worth of material on the final exam?

385
00:20:45,679 --> 00:20:47,908
No matter how much I think about it, I think he'll try to distinguish...

386
00:20:47,909 --> 00:20:49,649
the exam by broadening the exam's range.

387
00:20:51,850 --> 00:20:53,050
I'll fill it in.

388
00:20:53,750 --> 00:20:55,958
The academy will want me to become an empty castle,

389
00:20:55,959 --> 00:20:57,020
but I don't intend to do so.

390
00:20:57,389 --> 00:20:58,418
Hang on.

391
00:20:58,419 --> 00:21:00,529
I think there was once from two years ago at Guksabong.

392
00:21:00,530 --> 00:21:01,560
I'll go and get the material.

393
00:21:10,570 --> 00:21:12,540
Don't look at me like that. I won't fall easily.

394
00:21:15,010 --> 00:21:16,510
Shall I try meeting with Si Woo?

395
00:21:16,810 --> 00:21:18,279
He left his number yesterday.

396
00:21:18,280 --> 00:21:20,080
- If I meet him and plead... - Don't do that.

397
00:21:20,810 --> 00:21:21,879
It'll only make things worse.

398
00:21:24,350 --> 00:21:26,050
All right. Here.

399
00:21:29,219 --> 00:21:30,359
Sorry about this.

400
00:21:31,090 --> 00:21:33,329
I didn't know that the director would suddenly schedule...

401
00:21:33,330 --> 00:21:34,889
a makeup class.

402
00:21:35,500 --> 00:21:38,230
It only made you lose time to study, didn't it?

403
00:21:41,699 --> 00:21:42,740
It's fine.

404
00:21:43,300 --> 00:21:44,770
Yesterday's class was fun too.

405
00:21:46,340 --> 00:21:48,709
It was fun?

406
00:21:49,379 --> 00:21:50,409
Yes.

407
00:21:54,250 --> 00:21:55,580
Since you said you'd take a look,

408
00:21:57,080 --> 00:21:58,889
I took all my notes on the printouts.

409
00:22:00,250 --> 00:22:01,388
This is a copy.

410
00:22:01,389 --> 00:22:02,389
Right.

411
00:22:14,230 --> 00:22:15,540
Tell me in detail.

412
00:22:17,300 --> 00:22:19,269
Since it was a 1-on-1 lesson,

413
00:22:19,270 --> 00:22:21,869
she must've taken a rather sentimental approach.

414
00:22:22,439 --> 00:22:24,580
Especially in modern literature,

415
00:22:24,780 --> 00:22:26,879
she talked about stuff that wasn't related to the material.

416
00:22:27,449 --> 00:22:29,449
It doesn't seem like he'll switch academies, does it?

417
00:22:30,949 --> 00:22:32,689
How could he think such a thing?

418
00:22:43,530 --> 00:22:45,530
(Slowly, as if making friends)

419
00:22:47,669 --> 00:22:50,099
(The world is much wider outside of the passage.)

420
00:22:50,100 --> 00:22:52,810
(Vocabulary is your imagination.)

421
00:22:58,379 --> 00:23:00,379
(Director's office)

422
00:23:23,340 --> 00:23:25,340
The person you have reached is unavailable. Please leave...

423
00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:39,290
The person you have reached is unavailable. Please leave...

424
00:23:39,949 --> 00:23:42,359
Hang on... Where would he...

425
00:23:42,490 --> 00:23:44,520
Right, math.

426
00:24:03,609 --> 00:24:04,639
Si Woo!

427
00:24:05,980 --> 00:24:07,379
Hey, Lee Si Woo!

428
00:24:12,919 --> 00:24:13,919
What...

429
00:24:15,250 --> 00:24:16,260
Why...

430
00:24:17,619 --> 00:24:18,859
Why didn't you answer your phone?

431
00:24:20,490 --> 00:24:22,600
Oh, I had it on silent mode.

432
00:24:23,659 --> 00:24:26,069
I turned it down while talking to you.

433
00:24:26,070 --> 00:24:27,070
That's fine.

434
00:24:28,530 --> 00:24:29,899
Come with me.

435
00:24:34,070 --> 00:24:35,709
I have to go to my math academy.

436
00:24:36,340 --> 00:24:37,379
And I haven't eaten either.

437
00:24:37,879 --> 00:24:38,909
It'll only be a minute.

438
00:24:45,250 --> 00:24:47,689
Please do this for me. Okay?

439
00:24:51,560 --> 00:24:53,629
Gosh, I'm sorry.

440
00:24:54,060 --> 00:24:55,459
It's time for you to go to your academy.

441
00:24:57,629 --> 00:24:58,659
It's fine.

442
00:24:59,500 --> 00:25:00,669
How's school?

443
00:25:01,199 --> 00:25:03,469
Is it worth coming here from far away?

444
00:25:05,869 --> 00:25:07,709
Yes. It's all good.

445
00:25:10,010 --> 00:25:11,040
Yes.

446
00:25:11,139 --> 00:25:13,179
It'd be best to get straight to the point, right?

447
00:25:14,449 --> 00:25:16,418
I wanted to see you because I was curious...

448
00:25:16,419 --> 00:25:18,320
how the other academy's class was.

449
00:25:22,149 --> 00:25:23,189
But...

450
00:25:23,990 --> 00:25:26,590
I thought you weren't aware of this...

451
00:25:27,260 --> 00:25:28,859
That's what I heard.

452
00:25:34,399 --> 00:25:36,000
I heard you liked the class.

453
00:25:36,169 --> 00:25:37,600
Which part did you enjoy?

454
00:25:38,869 --> 00:25:40,740
Just this and that.

455
00:25:41,240 --> 00:25:42,510
You can speak comfortably.

456
00:25:47,480 --> 00:25:49,520
The analysis of the previous exam questions were meticulous.

457
00:25:51,179 --> 00:25:53,618
I thought she had prepared for the strategy on answering...

458
00:25:53,619 --> 00:25:55,250
short-answer questions very well too.

459
00:25:56,820 --> 00:25:59,260
And she provided questions from other schools in the area.

460
00:26:01,129 --> 00:26:03,230
I could tell that from the materials you gave me.

461
00:26:04,959 --> 00:26:08,129
Wouldn't it be better for me to take note of other teachers' classes...

462
00:26:08,230 --> 00:26:10,500
and become better myself?

463
00:26:10,840 --> 00:26:13,240
That would be a good thing for you too, Si Woo.

464
00:26:20,780 --> 00:26:23,919
I found this memo interesting.

465
00:26:29,389 --> 00:26:31,560
"Slowly, as if making friends."

466
00:26:31,659 --> 00:26:33,990
"The world is much wider outside of the passage."

467
00:26:34,490 --> 00:26:36,500
"Vocabulary is your imagination."

468
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:38,629
What are all these?

469
00:26:40,530 --> 00:26:41,530
It's nothing much.

470
00:26:42,800 --> 00:26:45,070
I just want to hear what you were thinking.

471
00:26:50,209 --> 00:26:51,379
Honestly, I...

472
00:26:53,409 --> 00:26:55,709
don't really like Korean.

473
00:26:55,919 --> 00:26:56,949
Is that so?

474
00:26:57,350 --> 00:27:00,050
For someone who says so, your scores are quite stable.

475
00:27:00,449 --> 00:27:01,520
Well, that is...

476
00:27:03,060 --> 00:27:05,928
For things like grammar, there's a formula,

477
00:27:05,929 --> 00:27:07,129
so it's not that hard.

478
00:27:08,689 --> 00:27:09,760
But for literature,

479
00:27:10,830 --> 00:27:14,070
I honestly don't get it, so I just try hard to memorize it.

480
00:27:16,369 --> 00:27:17,770
That always made me nervous.

481
00:27:19,169 --> 00:27:21,770
Since there are kids who are good at Korean because they like it.

482
00:27:22,939 --> 00:27:24,780
I thought it'd be hard to beat them at it.

483
00:27:26,949 --> 00:27:28,709
And on the first page of the textbook,

484
00:27:29,550 --> 00:27:31,118
it says that the purpose of studying Korean...

485
00:27:31,119 --> 00:27:33,290
is in living like a human being.

486
00:27:35,590 --> 00:27:36,689
I didn't think that reading this...

487
00:27:37,060 --> 00:27:39,459
made me feel any more like a human being.

488
00:27:42,129 --> 00:27:43,929
And I didn't even know what living like a human being meant.

489
00:27:47,500 --> 00:27:48,500
Anyway,

490
00:27:50,199 --> 00:27:51,199
Korean felt like...

491
00:27:52,639 --> 00:27:55,639
a subject that was like chasing rainbows.

492
00:28:00,209 --> 00:28:01,780
But after taking yesterday's class,

493
00:28:02,719 --> 00:28:05,379
I felt like I knew why I had disliked Korean until now.

494
00:28:07,449 --> 00:28:08,520
I think it felt similar...

495
00:28:09,359 --> 00:28:10,689
to the new school year starting,

496
00:28:12,060 --> 00:28:14,189
going into the classroom for the first time,

497
00:28:15,490 --> 00:28:18,699
and wondering who I'll eat lunch with that day.

498
00:28:27,139 --> 00:28:29,439
So, what I mean by that is...

499
00:28:31,580 --> 00:28:33,350
It's my first time learning about the author of the piece.

500
00:28:34,250 --> 00:28:36,850
And the characters in the piece are also new people to me.

501
00:28:37,949 --> 00:28:39,719
But I have to eat with them,

502
00:28:41,149 --> 00:28:42,959
and I have to quickly guess...

503
00:28:43,760 --> 00:28:46,990
what those people are thinking or what position they're in.

504
00:28:48,189 --> 00:28:49,530
I think that was what was hard.

505
00:28:51,859 --> 00:28:54,230
So, when I'd get a passage that I never saw before, I'd get flustered.

506
00:28:54,770 --> 00:28:56,869
And I'd just rely on instincts.

507
00:29:00,570 --> 00:29:02,679
But taking my time and approaching it slowly...

508
00:29:03,010 --> 00:29:05,709
made it feel kind of fun for the first time.

509
00:29:07,980 --> 00:29:11,149
Although I didn't feel any more like a human being,

510
00:29:13,290 --> 00:29:16,189
I also thought that I wanted to try writing...

511
00:29:17,560 --> 00:29:19,389
something like a literary critique.

512
00:29:22,830 --> 00:29:26,730
Sorry. I'm not very good at speaking.

513
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:34,340
Si Woo, aren't you aiming to go to medical school?

514
00:29:37,740 --> 00:29:38,980
I haven't decided yet.

515
00:29:39,310 --> 00:29:41,050
Your parents must want it.

516
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:44,919
You could give it a shot with early admissions.

517
00:29:47,419 --> 00:29:49,090
I could do that, but...

518
00:29:49,219 --> 00:29:50,559
Then, you should write a thesis that would give you an advantage...

519
00:29:50,560 --> 00:29:51,688
on your specific skills and talents section.

520
00:29:51,689 --> 00:29:54,060
Why are you trying to research something not worth your time?

521
00:30:00,230 --> 00:30:03,469
That's what I think is a shame with you, Si Woo.

522
00:30:04,969 --> 00:30:06,439
You have a good brain,

523
00:30:08,070 --> 00:30:12,580
but compared to kids who went to elementary and middle school here,

524
00:30:14,510 --> 00:30:17,520
you don't seem to have very many experts...

525
00:30:17,719 --> 00:30:19,619
to give you good advice.

526
00:30:20,350 --> 00:30:22,790
Or should I say that you seem to lack adults' guidance?

527
00:30:25,689 --> 00:30:27,429
You should meet with a college entrance consultant.

528
00:30:27,530 --> 00:30:28,560
They're experts.

529
00:30:28,760 --> 00:30:31,229
I'll get you an appointment with someone I know well.

530
00:30:31,230 --> 00:30:32,230
No.

531
00:30:35,300 --> 00:30:36,340
That's fine.

532
00:30:37,070 --> 00:30:38,540
You shouldn't feel burdened.

533
00:30:39,070 --> 00:30:41,539
It's my present to you because I'm grateful for what you told me.

534
00:30:41,540 --> 00:30:42,980
I'm really fine.

535
00:30:46,109 --> 00:30:47,149
I'm going to...

536
00:30:50,080 --> 00:30:51,350
switch academies.

537
00:31:03,100 --> 00:31:04,159
I'm upset.

538
00:31:08,669 --> 00:31:11,199
Have you told the other kids too?

539
00:31:19,139 --> 00:31:20,409
She's so scary.

540
00:31:37,800 --> 00:31:38,859
Mr. Park.

541
00:31:39,060 --> 00:31:40,469
Yes.

542
00:31:43,639 --> 00:31:44,740
Did you call me?

543
00:31:44,840 --> 00:31:47,770
What day does Ms. Seo Hye Jin not teach classes?

544
00:31:53,750 --> 00:31:54,850
Mondays, ma'am.

545
00:31:56,350 --> 00:31:57,379
It's today.

546
00:32:02,619 --> 00:32:04,590
Let's eat and come back to work. It's on me.

547
00:32:05,060 --> 00:32:06,060
Okay, let's go.

548
00:32:10,699 --> 00:32:12,060
Oh, one second.

549
00:32:19,300 --> 00:32:21,169
Shouldn't we be buying dinner?

550
00:32:26,510 --> 00:32:27,649
Mr. Choi Hyung Sun.

551
00:32:28,879 --> 00:32:30,249
I'm not sure if I called you...

552
00:32:30,250 --> 00:32:33,090
while you were resting after yesterday's event.

553
00:32:35,090 --> 00:32:37,020
Is that so? Good.

554
00:32:37,760 --> 00:32:40,490
I'd like to see you sometime at my academy.

555
00:32:43,760 --> 00:32:46,570
Right. There are a lot of eyes watching.

556
00:32:49,570 --> 00:32:51,070
I'll be waiting.

557
00:32:51,540 --> 00:32:53,869
Until the hour that Daechi-dong becomes quiet.

558
00:32:57,609 --> 00:32:58,679
I'm sorry.

559
00:32:59,179 --> 00:33:00,449
You should eat without me.

560
00:33:00,949 --> 00:33:02,010
- What? - What?

561
00:33:02,550 --> 00:33:03,619
Where are you going?

562
00:33:03,850 --> 00:33:05,179
I have an urgent meeting.

563
00:33:23,070 --> 00:33:25,439
Hey, are you finished?

564
00:33:25,939 --> 00:33:27,639
Okay, I'll be there in a bit.

565
00:33:27,939 --> 00:33:29,339
Okay. See you soon.

566
00:33:29,340 --> 00:33:31,878
- I'll be going first. - Bye, then.

567
00:33:31,879 --> 00:33:33,378
Goodness. Bye.

568
00:33:33,379 --> 00:33:35,750
Okay, I'll be right there.

569
00:33:45,719 --> 00:33:46,929
Thank you.

Yes, come in.

577

Welcome, Ms. Seo Hye Jin.

578
00:37:45,730 --> 00:37:47,900
It's nice to meet you, Ms. Choi Hyung Sun.

579
00:37:48,730 --> 00:37:50,239
Mr. Park, you should get going.

580
00:37:53,310 --> 00:37:54,310
Pardon?

581
00:37:54,969 --> 00:37:57,440
Go on. Our conversation might last a while.

582
00:37:57,810 --> 00:37:58,810
Right.

583
00:38:09,250 --> 00:38:11,589
Yesterday must have been a tough day.

584
00:38:12,219 --> 00:38:13,889
It was a meaningful time.

585
00:38:15,089 --> 00:38:16,130
Thanks to you.

586
00:38:17,759 --> 00:38:20,269
Heewon High School students are at a high level,

587
00:38:20,270 --> 00:38:22,900
but from a teacher's perspective, they are lacking in many ways.

588
00:38:23,699 --> 00:38:25,769
Since exams are approaching soon,

589
00:38:25,770 --> 00:38:28,238
one can't help but notice all the missing pieces.

590
00:38:28,239 --> 00:38:29,270
I understand.

591
00:38:30,179 --> 00:38:32,710
Just think of it as an old woman's concerns.

592
00:38:34,080 --> 00:38:36,080
What is it that you wanted to say?

593
00:38:37,850 --> 00:38:39,650
Shall we get up for a minute?

594
00:38:40,389 --> 00:38:42,089
There's something I want to show you.

595
00:38:56,230 --> 00:38:59,540
Since I was in middle school, I've wanted to be a teacher.

596
00:39:00,670 --> 00:39:04,310
My homeroom teacher in seventh grade was a cool person.

597
00:39:06,650 --> 00:39:09,509
So, I studied very hard,

598
00:39:10,049 --> 00:39:11,719
and I was quite good at it too.

599
00:39:13,290 --> 00:39:15,750
What was your dream, Ms. Seo?

600
00:39:18,089 --> 00:39:19,489
I graduated with a law degree.

601
00:39:20,330 --> 00:39:21,659
I know that much.

602
00:39:21,960 --> 00:39:23,960
I mean, what was your dream?

603
00:39:28,130 --> 00:39:29,170
I don't remember.

604
00:39:30,299 --> 00:39:33,909
I majored in Korean Education at Seoul National University.

605
00:39:34,639 --> 00:39:37,508
I passed the teacher certification examination easily too.

606
00:39:37,509 --> 00:39:39,440
And I became a teacher at the age of 24.

607
00:39:39,779 --> 00:39:43,719
I worked in schools until the age of 40 with great satisfaction.

608
00:39:45,350 --> 00:39:47,389
Should I underline "the age of 40..."

609
00:39:47,989 --> 00:39:48,989
Or under "schools?"

610
00:39:51,560 --> 00:39:52,959
The characteristic of good students...

611
00:39:52,960 --> 00:39:56,059
is that they ask good questions, not give good answers.

612
00:39:56,060 --> 00:39:57,900
You should underline "schools."

613
00:39:58,529 --> 00:39:59,830
I realized...

614
00:40:00,069 --> 00:40:02,069
what I wanted wasn't just to teach.

615
00:40:03,170 --> 00:40:06,269
What I wanted was absolute authority...

616
00:40:06,270 --> 00:40:07,869
and respect.

617
00:40:10,310 --> 00:40:12,738
You might not know, Ms. Seo,

618
00:40:12,739 --> 00:40:15,548
but when I was a schoolteacher,

619
00:40:15,549 --> 00:40:17,080
we had a lot of power.

620
00:40:18,850 --> 00:40:21,920
I guess that's what I yearned for.

621
00:40:22,389 --> 00:40:26,059
But as time passed and things changed,

622
00:40:26,060 --> 00:40:28,060
schools stopped being such a place.

623
00:40:29,230 --> 00:40:30,259
I decided...

624
00:40:31,029 --> 00:40:33,729
to send as many students as possible to university...

625
00:40:33,730 --> 00:40:36,130
and be treated as the best in return.

626
00:40:38,369 --> 00:40:40,338
That's why since I quit teaching...

627
00:40:40,339 --> 00:40:42,139
at a school, I never worked for anyone.

628
00:40:42,540 --> 00:40:45,009
I started off immediately as a private tutor.

629
00:40:45,779 --> 00:40:48,279
In six months I had enough students to teach in groups,

630
00:40:49,350 --> 00:40:52,150
and it took me just one year to turn that into an academy.

631
00:40:55,589 --> 00:40:57,489
You called me here to recite your history?

632
00:40:58,389 --> 00:41:01,960
I grew the academy this much without anyone else's help.

633
00:41:03,259 --> 00:41:06,060
I moved to this building about...

634
00:41:07,429 --> 00:41:08,730
six years ago.

635
00:41:10,699 --> 00:41:12,169
We ran out of space, so we rented...

636
00:41:12,170 --> 00:41:14,639
another building for kids from foreign language high schools.

637
00:41:15,270 --> 00:41:17,009
We also have a branch in Banpo-dong.

638
00:41:17,839 --> 00:41:19,579
Why is this room vacant...

639
00:41:19,580 --> 00:41:21,179
if you're short on space?

640
00:41:24,520 --> 00:41:25,779
It's the vice director's office.

641
00:41:28,089 --> 00:41:30,159
I've accomplished almost all I wanted,

642
00:41:30,619 --> 00:41:33,690
but I hadn't yet found the owner of this room.

643
00:41:36,130 --> 00:41:38,330
I'd been searching for the person for years,

644
00:41:38,830 --> 00:41:41,170
and today, I got to invite you over.

645
00:41:46,069 --> 00:41:47,869
I knew you wouldn't be surprised.

646
00:41:54,179 --> 00:41:55,580
Ms. Seo.

647
00:41:56,779 --> 00:41:59,819
Do you really think she can get more Chanyoung students to come?

648
00:42:02,920 --> 00:42:03,989
I bet.

649
00:42:05,560 --> 00:42:09,130
With 80 students, she could start her own academy.

650
00:42:10,100 --> 00:42:11,659
That would be a miracle.

651
00:42:13,400 --> 00:42:14,600
That's her speciality.

652
00:42:22,069 --> 00:42:24,580
Why is it just you two?

653
00:42:25,009 --> 00:42:28,579
Ms. Seo said she had something to do.

654
00:42:28,580 --> 00:42:29,650
What's the matter?

655
00:42:30,650 --> 00:42:31,979
We have a team dinner.

656
00:42:31,980 --> 00:42:33,549
Would you like to join us?

657
00:42:33,690 --> 00:42:35,619
Yes. I do.

658
00:42:36,049 --> 00:42:37,060
Come along.

659
00:42:38,619 --> 00:42:40,489
Maybe next time.

660
00:42:40,589 --> 00:42:41,929
You guys go ahead.

661
00:42:42,960 --> 00:42:44,000
Okay.

662
00:42:45,730 --> 00:42:47,529
- You ate already. Is it okay? - I'm fine.

663
00:42:50,940 --> 00:42:54,039
Many instructors are great at teaching,

664
00:42:54,040 --> 00:42:57,380
making teaching material, and managing students.

665
00:42:58,339 --> 00:42:59,909
What I saw in you...

666
00:43:00,279 --> 00:43:03,179
is the boldness and the ability to plan things.

667
00:43:05,549 --> 00:43:06,549
Just a moment.

668
00:43:19,029 --> 00:43:20,468
This is the first flyer I made...

669
00:43:20,469 --> 00:43:22,830
after quitting as a schoolteacher.

670
00:43:24,600 --> 00:43:26,368
It's a shabby design,

671
00:43:26,369 --> 00:43:28,610
but the headline caused quite a stir.

672
00:43:29,509 --> 00:43:32,809
My selling point was the fact that I'd set up the rules...

673
00:43:32,810 --> 00:43:35,750
at Heewon High on how Korean exams were created.

674
00:43:37,520 --> 00:43:40,750
You have no idea what a hard time I had after these went out.

675
00:43:41,449 --> 00:43:45,119
The Korean teachers at Heewon High rose against me like a pack of dogs.

676
00:43:49,259 --> 00:43:50,330
We have...

677
00:43:51,199 --> 00:43:52,759
some things in common.

678
00:43:53,500 --> 00:43:55,000
I like that.

679
00:43:58,770 --> 00:44:01,009
Have you signed a contract for your next year's lectures?

680
00:44:01,670 --> 00:44:03,339
No. Not yet.

681
00:44:05,580 --> 00:44:07,409
Why don't you sign one with me?

682
00:44:09,909 --> 00:44:11,778
What's your current split...

683
00:44:11,779 --> 00:44:14,149
with the academy when it comes to sales?

684
00:44:14,150 --> 00:44:16,350
I can't tell you that.

685
00:44:16,790 --> 00:44:18,060
It's our secret.

686
00:44:18,489 --> 00:44:20,459
Then tell me the ratio you want.

687
00:44:20,460 --> 00:44:21,790
I can see you get it.

688
00:44:23,699 --> 00:44:26,359
You won't have to worry about the minor stuff...

689
00:44:26,360 --> 00:44:29,429
like dealing with moms and students, and managing your teaching material.

690
00:44:30,029 --> 00:44:32,069
I'll assign you a great TA.

691
00:44:34,040 --> 00:44:35,968
Provide great classes...

692
00:44:35,969 --> 00:44:38,279
and help me grow my academy.

693
00:44:40,380 --> 00:44:42,949
I think you overestimate me.

694
00:44:46,049 --> 00:44:47,089
I reached...

695
00:44:47,790 --> 00:44:49,650
my twilight years...

696
00:44:50,319 --> 00:44:52,389
without a husband or child.

697
00:44:54,089 --> 00:44:56,459
As the person who established this academy,

698
00:44:56,460 --> 00:45:00,270
I want to maintain a stable income and the absolute respect...

699
00:45:00,869 --> 00:45:02,299
before retiring majestically.

700
00:45:04,040 --> 00:45:07,610
To do so, I need someone with a long-term view...

701
00:45:07,770 --> 00:45:10,309
to grow this academy well...

702
00:45:10,310 --> 00:45:11,779
and take over from me.

703
00:45:16,310 --> 00:45:18,979
If you were to bring your Chanyoung High students...

704
00:45:18,980 --> 00:45:21,219
and join Choisun Academy,

705
00:45:22,549 --> 00:45:24,988
we can build up a strong Korean academy...

706
00:45:24,989 --> 00:45:27,560
that rivals most places that teach multiple subjects.

707
00:45:33,869 --> 00:45:34,929
I apologize.

708
00:45:36,429 --> 00:45:37,569
What did you find funny?

709
00:45:38,139 --> 00:45:39,239
It wasn't funny.

710
00:45:40,170 --> 00:45:42,509
I lost control momentarily because I was so relieved.

711
00:45:45,880 --> 00:45:47,449
I guess Si Woo said he'd switch.

712
00:45:49,710 --> 00:45:51,980
And take his friends.

713
00:46:32,290 --> 00:46:34,929
I'm pretty sure Lee Si Woo will come.

714
00:46:44,199 --> 00:46:47,539
I had the biggest class of Heewon students for 20 years,

715
00:46:47,540 --> 00:46:49,909
and that won't fall so easily.

716
00:46:50,779 --> 00:46:53,439
Didn't you make me this offer because you thought...

717
00:46:53,440 --> 00:46:55,350
it would be a problem in the long run?

718
00:46:55,880 --> 00:46:57,449
Starting immediately with the new kids.

719
00:46:57,549 --> 00:47:01,388
If you must pay a penalty for breaking your current contract,

720
00:47:01,389 --> 00:47:02,619
I'll cover that too.

721
00:47:06,020 --> 00:47:07,089
Ms. Choi.

722
00:47:08,489 --> 00:47:10,258
Thank you for the great offer.

723
00:47:10,259 --> 00:47:11,460
I mean that.

724
00:47:12,929 --> 00:47:15,799
Would you like to take a draft of the contract?

725
00:47:16,029 --> 00:47:18,069
But there's something I must set straight.

726
00:47:21,009 --> 00:47:22,610
The boldness and planning.

727
00:47:23,110 --> 00:47:24,880
That wasn't all me.

728
00:47:25,480 --> 00:47:27,580
Oh, right. Of course.

729
00:47:28,310 --> 00:47:30,650
You did raise one great student.

730
00:47:32,049 --> 00:47:35,049
But the person I want is you, Ms. Seo,

731
00:47:35,619 --> 00:47:38,088
who teaches the biggest class...

732
00:47:38,089 --> 00:47:39,589
of Chanyoung High students.

733
00:47:46,699 --> 00:47:48,600
May I think about it?

734
00:47:50,069 --> 00:47:51,069
Of course.

735
00:48:12,159 --> 00:48:13,219
Where are you?

736
00:48:34,080 --> 00:48:35,110
Hey.

737
00:48:35,650 --> 00:48:36,679
Where did you go?

738
00:48:37,549 --> 00:48:38,619
Why did you come back?

739
00:48:38,949 --> 00:48:41,718
I came for my car, saw the lights, and came upstairs.

740
00:48:41,719 --> 00:48:43,318
Your bag and stuff were here,

741
00:48:43,319 --> 00:48:45,020
but you weren't, so I wondered where you were.

742
00:48:46,060 --> 00:48:48,560
Did you go out to see the director or vice-director?

743
00:48:49,089 --> 00:48:50,659
What did they say this time?

744
00:48:51,060 --> 00:48:52,259
You're not entirely wrong.

745
00:48:52,699 --> 00:48:54,869
Take this. It's my consultation log.

746
00:48:56,270 --> 00:48:58,069
One for the parents, one for the students.

747
00:48:58,500 --> 00:49:01,169
Consultations are an important part of the job.

748
00:49:01,170 --> 00:49:03,980
I had put that off because you had something much more pressing.

749
00:49:04,540 --> 00:49:05,908
There are some set questions.

750
00:49:05,909 --> 00:49:07,210
I'll tell you how to answer them.

751
00:49:08,380 --> 00:49:10,310
Who did you meet?

752
00:49:14,690 --> 00:49:15,690
Hello?

753
00:49:18,159 --> 00:49:19,190
Si Woo will join us.

754
00:49:21,259 --> 00:49:22,360
With his friends.

755
00:49:30,469 --> 00:49:31,500
My gosh.

756
00:49:33,170 --> 00:49:35,139
That's such a relief.

757
00:49:35,670 --> 00:49:37,980
- I'm not yet sure... - I'm sure.

758
00:49:38,179 --> 00:49:40,480
I was thinking about that. That he'd come here.

759
00:49:41,880 --> 00:49:44,349
You seemed just fine. Were you actually disappointed?

760
00:49:44,350 --> 00:49:46,980
I was this close to calling the kid, okay?

761
00:49:47,319 --> 00:49:49,020
My gosh.

762
00:49:52,319 --> 00:49:53,319
How did you find out?

763
00:49:56,389 --> 00:49:58,000
It happens a few times a year.

764
00:49:58,600 --> 00:50:00,999
Though this was the most shocking offer...

765
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:02,500
I'd ever received.

766
00:50:07,310 --> 00:50:08,610
I haven't decided yet.

767
00:50:12,540 --> 00:50:13,810
Can I ask you something?

768
00:50:15,480 --> 00:50:16,480
What is it?

769
00:50:16,949 --> 00:50:18,448
If I go to Choisun Academy,

770
00:50:18,449 --> 00:50:20,650
will you not be able to start a class for Heewon High kids?

771
00:50:21,920 --> 00:50:22,949
Right.

772
00:50:23,790 --> 00:50:24,989
There's that too.

773
00:50:27,860 --> 00:50:29,259
When you got the offer,

774
00:50:30,130 --> 00:50:32,600
did you feel like jumping for joy?

775
00:50:55,520 --> 00:50:57,089
The question you asked earlier.

776
00:50:58,319 --> 00:50:59,920
If I'm to answer it now,

777
00:51:00,190 --> 00:51:01,659
I wasn't that overjoyed.

778
00:51:05,259 --> 00:51:07,968
Because I thought...

779
00:51:07,969 --> 00:51:09,969
I deserved that kind of offer.

780
00:51:14,940 --> 00:51:16,469
Go on home. I'm tired.

781
00:51:17,110 --> 00:51:18,139
Okay.

782
00:51:18,909 --> 00:51:19,940
Bye.

783
00:51:34,790 --> 00:51:36,259
Text me when you're home.

784
00:51:36,489 --> 00:51:37,500
See you.

785
00:54:24,230 --> 00:54:28,199
(Bangbae New Green Hill 201)

786
00:54:41,179 --> 00:54:44,179
Here's the draft of your contract with Choisun Academy.

787
00:54:44,679 --> 00:54:47,079
I left the academy and instructor...

788
00:54:47,080 --> 00:54:48,589
profit ratio a blank.

789
00:54:48,889 --> 00:54:51,560
Read through it and tell me what ratio you want.

790
00:55:05,699 --> 00:55:06,738
Lawyer Cha.

791
00:55:06,739 --> 00:55:07,969
Come on in.

792
00:55:08,310 --> 00:55:09,869
Am I disturbing your busy schedule?

793
00:55:10,239 --> 00:55:12,279
Enough with the niceties and sit down.

794
00:55:12,710 --> 00:55:13,739
Give me what you brought.

795
00:55:14,080 --> 00:55:15,080
Okay.

796
00:55:16,610 --> 00:55:17,850
You asked for it right away.

797
00:55:19,420 --> 00:55:20,480
We're both busy.

798
00:55:23,920 --> 00:55:25,790
How long do I have to review these?

799
00:55:27,790 --> 00:55:28,960
I'd like your feedback sooner than later.

800
00:55:31,330 --> 00:55:33,860
The thin one's the real deal. The one that mentions money.

801
00:55:36,100 --> 00:55:38,099
Why is my heart beating so fast...

802
00:55:38,100 --> 00:55:39,569
when it's not even my contract?

803
00:55:40,270 --> 00:55:43,709
Are you going to make history by changing jobs?

804
00:55:43,710 --> 00:55:44,909
With a huge pay raise?

805
00:55:45,839 --> 00:55:47,810
It's not like that. Just go through it for me.

806
00:55:48,509 --> 00:55:49,679
What's not like that?

807
00:55:50,819 --> 00:55:51,850
Why isn't it like that?

808
00:55:54,020 --> 00:55:55,049
So Young.

809
00:55:55,790 --> 00:55:56,989
Yes, speak.

810
00:55:58,420 --> 00:56:00,190
I feel so weird.

811
00:56:03,659 --> 00:56:06,929
The Seo Hye Jin before the free lecture...

812
00:56:07,060 --> 00:56:09,369
and the Seo Hye Jin after seems like a different person.

813
00:56:11,040 --> 00:56:12,139
What do you mean?

814
00:56:12,900 --> 00:56:15,138
Like you said, I should write what I want...

815
00:56:15,139 --> 00:56:16,209
on the two-page contract...

816
00:56:16,210 --> 00:56:17,779
and walk off with no regrets.

817
00:56:18,179 --> 00:56:19,980
I should spit with hatred on my current job and move.

818
00:56:20,949 --> 00:56:22,049
Spit on them.

819
00:56:22,350 --> 00:56:24,279
If they sue, I'll represent you.

820
00:56:27,279 --> 00:56:29,350
So why am I so reluctant to leave?

821
00:56:30,250 --> 00:56:31,290
What?

822
00:56:34,630 --> 00:56:36,460
I had no problems so far.

823
00:56:37,290 --> 00:56:39,929
I taught hard and well and made enough money.

824
00:56:40,830 --> 00:56:43,529
The more kids I taught, the bigger my account balance got.

825
00:56:45,069 --> 00:56:46,969
I lived and worked for that.

826
00:56:47,199 --> 00:56:48,239
But what?

827
00:56:49,710 --> 00:56:51,379
I don't think I can go back to that.

828
00:56:51,380 --> 00:56:54,580
It's really hard to explain.

829
00:56:55,279 --> 00:56:57,310
There's something you find hard to explain?

830
00:56:58,119 --> 00:56:59,179
Exactly.

831
00:57:00,219 --> 00:57:01,219
So what?

832
00:57:01,520 --> 00:57:04,259
Do you want me to ask more detailed questions,

833
00:57:05,119 --> 00:57:06,290
or to just watch over you?

834
00:57:08,230 --> 00:57:10,690
Just watch over me.

835
00:57:13,730 --> 00:57:14,900
I'm scared.

836
00:57:18,639 --> 00:57:20,908
(Daechi Chase's miracle Lee Jun Ho, Main instructor Seo Hye Jin)

837
00:57:20,909 --> 00:57:25,179
Bus number 38 will arrive shortly.

838
00:57:27,440 --> 00:57:30,309
Though this was the most shocking offer...

839
00:57:30,310 --> 00:57:31,949
I'd ever received.

840
00:57:42,989 --> 00:57:44,560
Sorry for asking you to come all the way.

841
00:57:45,400 --> 00:57:47,028
The moms took over the cafe,

842
00:57:47,029 --> 00:57:48,900
and the instructors are slowly coming to work.

843
00:57:49,600 --> 00:57:50,600
I don't mind.

844
00:57:50,670 --> 00:57:53,069
I don't know when I last walked in the sun.

845
00:57:54,270 --> 00:57:55,569
Tell me if your feet hurt.

846
00:57:56,069 --> 00:57:57,339
It's fine.

847
00:57:57,440 --> 00:57:58,839
Tell me what this is about.

848
00:58:01,710 --> 00:58:02,710
Ms. Seo.

849
00:58:04,179 --> 00:58:06,449
How can I stop you from going to Choisun Academy?

850
00:58:07,690 --> 00:58:08,690
What?

851
00:58:12,259 --> 00:58:15,060
I won't make any more silly suggestions.

852
00:58:16,330 --> 00:58:18,729
I'll recruit 100 more students from Chanyoung High if you want.

853
00:58:18,730 --> 00:58:20,429
I'll recruit 100 from Heewon High if you ask.

854
00:58:20,860 --> 00:58:23,299
I'll help you earn much more than Choisun Academy offered.

855
00:58:24,199 --> 00:58:27,469
Well, I can't do that right away, but I'll work really hard...

856
00:58:27,569 --> 00:58:29,409
and expand your class.

857
00:58:30,909 --> 00:58:32,440
Can't you work with me for one more year?

858
00:58:34,009 --> 00:58:36,049
You said you wanted to buy a building in Gangnam.

859
00:58:36,909 --> 00:58:39,350
But you'll recruit more kids for my class?

860
00:58:39,779 --> 00:58:41,589
It's an investment on my part too.

861
00:58:42,449 --> 00:58:45,520
Can't you teach me for one more year?

862
00:58:45,960 --> 00:58:47,219
I'm grateful for the offer,

863
00:58:47,489 --> 00:58:49,028
but you have no collateral.

864
00:58:49,029 --> 00:58:51,629
Well... Just believe in me.

865
00:58:51,630 --> 00:58:53,600
You said I could do anything.

866
00:58:55,270 --> 00:58:58,069
Once we open a class for the Heewon High students,

867
00:58:58,500 --> 00:58:59,799
the director will change his tune.

868
00:59:00,170 --> 00:59:01,939
If you just keep doing what you do,

869
00:59:01,940 --> 00:59:03,239
I'll do anything.

870
00:59:03,409 --> 00:59:05,678
I'll make textbooks all night if you tell me to.

871
00:59:05,679 --> 00:59:07,079
I'll improve the students' grades...

872
00:59:07,080 --> 00:59:08,310
Can you promise that?

873
00:59:09,049 --> 00:59:10,049
What?

874
00:59:10,050 --> 00:59:12,150
Will you let me teach all the students you recruit?

875
00:59:14,650 --> 00:59:15,650
Yes.

876
00:59:18,989 --> 00:59:20,119
But just for one year.

877
00:59:20,690 --> 00:59:21,889
After that, they're mine.

878

(Daechi Chase)

880
00:59:44,480 --> 00:59:45,750
The doors are closing.

881
00:59:50,589 --> 00:59:52,019
- Going up. - Can I get in?

882
00:59:52,020 --> 00:59:53,020
Yes.

883
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:06,139
Isn't he from Heewon High?

884
01:00:06,400 --> 01:00:07,469
He is.

885
01:00:09,710 --> 01:00:10,909
He's a cutie.

886
01:00:20,449 --> 01:00:21,520
So,

887
01:00:22,119 --> 01:00:24,318
- let's not do that. - Okay.

888
01:00:24,319 --> 01:00:27,520
Tell them to prepare the ad to coincide with the holiday...

889
01:00:28,759 --> 01:00:29,759
Excuse me.

890
01:00:33,159 --> 01:00:34,869
Hey, Heewon...

891
01:00:35,830 --> 01:00:38,170
You must attend Heewon High School.

892
01:00:38,500 --> 01:00:39,540
Yes.

893
01:00:39,670 --> 01:00:42,569
Who do I talk to about the final exam special lecture?

894
01:00:43,139 --> 01:00:44,879
Some kids say they've given up...

895
01:00:44,880 --> 01:00:46,338
on studying for exams...

896
01:00:46,339 --> 01:00:48,908
and want to ace the SAT or even plan to take it many times.

897
01:00:48,909 --> 01:00:49,909
Okay.

898
01:00:52,949 --> 01:00:55,250
A student from Heewon High is here for a consultation.

899
01:00:58,259 --> 01:00:59,290
Let's go.

900
01:00:59,619 --> 01:01:01,888
The student's here alone? With no parent?

901
01:01:01,889 --> 01:01:02,960
He's alone.

902
01:01:03,560 --> 01:01:04,560
Come on, let's go.

903
01:01:07,730 --> 01:01:08,799
You're on your own.

904
01:01:10,199 --> 01:01:13,600
Why... That's not right.

905
01:01:13,799 --> 01:01:14,869
He's your first student.

906
01:01:15,810 --> 01:01:16,868
Don't think about...

907
01:01:16,869 --> 01:01:19,339
how to seduce him or use him to start a new class.

908
01:01:20,279 --> 01:01:23,380
Feel and relish in the emotions your first student gives you.

909
01:01:25,049 --> 01:01:26,119
Okay.

910
01:01:27,049 --> 01:01:28,420
I'm off, then.

911
01:01:28,989 --> 01:01:30,989
(Consultation Room 2)

912
01:01:36,589 --> 01:01:37,999
It's good to see you, Si Woo.

913
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:39,560
- Hello. - Hi.

914
01:01:44,869 --> 01:01:47,339
I knew you'd come. I just wondered when.

915
01:01:47,869 --> 01:01:49,710
Thanks for keeping the wait short.

916
01:01:50,710 --> 01:01:51,710
Sure.

917
01:01:51,710 --> 01:01:52,710
Do you have plans for later?

918
01:01:53,810 --> 01:01:55,850
No. It's my free day today.

919
01:01:56,179 --> 01:01:57,179
Sounds good.

920
01:02:01,350 --> 01:02:02,350
What?

921
01:02:03,489 --> 01:02:04,959
I didn't get a good look at you...

922
01:02:04,960 --> 01:02:07,219
the day of the free lecture.

923
01:02:07,619 --> 01:02:08,759
As you know,

924
01:02:09,690 --> 01:02:12,460
I was expecting to be massively humiliated.

925
01:02:14,869 --> 01:02:18,040
I'm enjoying the emotions only now.

926
01:02:20,670 --> 01:02:23,369
I haven't yet registered or paid.

927
01:02:24,170 --> 01:02:25,210
Right.

928
01:02:26,909 --> 01:02:29,080
You can be pretty cold.

929
01:02:30,480 --> 01:02:32,618
Okay, then. So I can get you to pay,

930
01:02:32,619 --> 01:02:34,889
let's take care of some formalities.

931
01:02:35,619 --> 01:02:37,589
Answer my questions freely.

932
01:02:38,920 --> 01:02:41,529
The typical questions academy people ask.

933
01:02:41,889 --> 01:02:43,459
I prepared some answers.

934
01:02:43,460 --> 01:02:45,659
Okay. Can I hear them?

935
01:02:46,699 --> 01:02:47,730
Yes.

936
01:02:48,929 --> 01:02:50,130
I'm a freshman at Heewon High.

937
01:02:51,170 --> 01:02:54,069
I don't like Korean much, but I'm not bad at it.

938
01:02:55,239 --> 01:02:58,079
I got 100 percent on the midterm.

939
01:02:58,080 --> 01:02:59,139
Gosh.

940
01:03:00,239 --> 01:03:03,710
I study Korean 1 or 2 hours a day.

941
01:03:04,409 --> 01:03:06,350
I skip when I have an academy class.

942
01:03:07,779 --> 01:03:11,089
I do my homework on time, and I put my effort into it.

943
01:03:12,489 --> 01:03:13,520
And...

944
01:03:16,130 --> 01:03:19,630
I have trouble understanding and solving literature questions.

945
01:03:20,429 --> 01:03:22,900
I could memorize everything and get full marks,

946
01:03:24,429 --> 01:03:27,770
but I get flustered when I come across something new.

947
01:03:32,210 --> 01:03:34,710
I say my goal is to get into a medical school in Seoul,

948
01:03:35,509 --> 01:03:37,009
but that's my mom's goal.

949
01:03:37,750 --> 01:03:38,850
I don't know yet.

950
01:03:42,020 --> 01:03:44,250
I haven't chosen an elective yet.

951
01:03:45,389 --> 01:03:47,819
I'd like to know if you have a scholarship program.

952
01:03:53,860 --> 01:03:55,600
That's about it.

953
01:03:56,069 --> 01:03:57,069
Okay.

954
01:04:00,569 --> 01:04:01,569
You don't like Korean?

955
01:04:05,480 --> 01:04:06,509
I think so.

956
01:04:08,380 --> 01:04:09,409
That's strange.

957
01:04:09,949 --> 01:04:11,449
Aren't you good at writing?

958
01:04:13,049 --> 01:04:14,750
Not in the logical essay sense.

959
01:04:15,250 --> 01:04:17,420
Isn't there a field or topic you're good at writing about?

960
01:04:17,989 --> 01:04:19,960
Like reviews or blogs.

961
01:04:21,989 --> 01:04:23,060
How did you know?

962
01:04:25,560 --> 01:04:29,100
Because you're a great teen who can't help but be a good writer.

963
01:04:36,810 --> 01:04:39,008
I haven't paid yet.

964
01:04:39,009 --> 01:04:40,339
Let's talk about the scholarship.

965
01:04:41,139 --> 01:04:43,580
I can talk about that with confidence.

966
01:04:43,980 --> 01:04:47,080
I'm this academy's first-ever scholarship recipient.

967
01:04:47,350 --> 01:04:48,489
It's a glorious title.

968
01:04:52,060 --> 01:04:53,860
You can start without me.

969
01:04:54,460 --> 01:04:57,330
No. An important issue came up at my academy.

970
01:04:58,060 --> 01:05:01,230
Yes. I'll call you when I get there.

971
01:05:08,869 --> 01:05:11,069
Do you think we can open a class?

972
01:05:12,480 --> 01:05:14,710
I can't say. He's just one student.

973
01:05:16,049 --> 01:05:18,880
We don't know how much influence he has at his school.

974
01:05:19,020 --> 01:05:21,249
We don't know his grade class or about his friends.

975
01:05:21,250 --> 01:05:22,319
Right.

976
01:05:22,719 --> 01:05:24,319
We should've asked...

977
01:05:24,690 --> 01:05:26,920
who the one student who stayed for the lecture was.

978
01:05:27,159 --> 01:05:28,190
What he's like.

979
01:05:28,589 --> 01:05:31,130
If we do end up opening a Heewon class,

980
01:05:31,860 --> 01:05:33,500
won't it be a huge deal?

981
01:05:39,969 --> 01:05:43,040
We didn't make a big mistake, did we?

982
01:05:44,569 --> 01:05:46,079
Elision means there are...

983
01:05:46,080 --> 01:05:47,610
fewer syllables to say.

984
01:05:48,080 --> 01:05:49,810
With that in mind, read this again.

985
01:05:51,009 --> 01:05:52,119
Which one doesn't match?

986
01:05:54,380 --> 01:05:56,350
(Consultation Room 2, Administration Office)

987
01:06:10,069 --> 01:06:12,139
- A Heewon kid's here? - Yes.

988
01:06:12,900 --> 01:06:14,639
That's a huge deal.

989
01:06:15,009 --> 01:06:16,569
We don't know anything yet.

990
01:06:17,440 --> 01:06:19,610
We can't start a new class with one kid.

991
01:06:50,069 --> 01:06:51,170
The next passage.

992
01:06:53,409 --> 01:06:54,480
Let's take a 15-minute break.

993
01:07:08,790 --> 01:07:10,790
(Consultation Room 2, Administration Office)

994
01:07:22,670 --> 01:07:24,210
(Daechi Chase)

995
01:07:24,980 --> 01:07:25,980
Take care.

996
01:07:26,909 --> 01:07:29,048
I will. Goodbye.

997
01:07:29,049 --> 01:07:30,909
- Bye. - Goodbye.

998
01:07:31,949 --> 01:07:32,980
Well?

999
01:07:34,020 --> 01:07:35,020
It's over.

1000
01:07:51,699 --> 01:07:52,699
The other students...

1001
01:07:59,279 --> 01:08:01,650
Heewon High has a shorter day tomorrow, so...

1002
01:08:05,319 --> 01:08:06,319
they'll come then.

1003
01:08:08,549 --> 01:08:10,719
- My gosh. - How many do you think will come?

1004
01:08:10,920 --> 01:08:12,158
Enough to open a class?

1005
01:08:12,159 --> 01:08:13,618
Yes, that shouldn't be a problem.

1006
01:08:13,619 --> 01:08:15,830
Oh, how nice.

1007
01:08:16,690 --> 01:08:18,730
I should assign a great classroom.

1008
01:08:19,360 --> 01:08:20,429
Right, Ms. Woo?

1009
01:08:20,600 --> 01:08:23,229
- Congratulations. - Thank you.

1010
01:08:23,230 --> 01:08:25,369
Congratulations, Ms. Seo.

1011
01:08:25,370 --> 01:08:26,439
Thanks.

1012
01:08:26,440 --> 01:08:28,810
- Ms. Seo. - Fill me in after class.

1013
01:08:29,110 --> 01:08:30,169
I took a short break.

1014
01:08:31,209 --> 01:08:33,439
Let's talk in my office.

1015
01:08:33,440 --> 01:08:34,838
- Yes. - Let's go.

1016
01:08:34,839 --> 01:08:36,150
- Come along. - Okay.

1017
01:08:45,919 --> 01:08:47,919
(Daechi Chase)

1018
01:09:18,120 --> 01:09:21,929
(The Midnight Romance in Hagwon)

1019
01:09:22,190 --> 01:09:24,190
Choisun Academy. You can go.

1020
01:09:24,490 --> 01:09:25,628
That hurts.

1021
01:09:25,629 --> 01:09:27,458
I hoped for a beautiful farewell.

1022
01:09:27,459 --> 01:09:29,269
Don't act like you're so noble.

1023
01:09:29,270 --> 01:09:30,299
Let go!

1024
01:09:30,469 --> 01:09:33,298
I can't imagine our academy without Seo Hye Jin.

1025
01:09:33,299 --> 01:09:36,208
Once someone like that turns away,

1026
01:09:36,209 --> 01:09:37,910
it could be really scary.

1027
01:09:38,139 --> 01:09:39,809
Do you have time to slack off?

1028
01:09:39,810 --> 01:09:41,309
Focus on your own goal.

1029
01:09:41,310 --> 01:09:43,008
I'm holding back...

1030
01:09:43,009 --> 01:09:44,708
much more desperately than you think.

1031
01:09:44,709 --> 01:09:47,049
Ms. Seo. You're a real headache.

1032
01:09:47,749 --> 01:09:49,389
What am I to do if you do this?
