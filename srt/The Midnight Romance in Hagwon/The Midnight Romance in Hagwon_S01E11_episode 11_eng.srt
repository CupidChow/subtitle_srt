 - G-Give me that. 
- Gosh...

14
00:00:51,690 --> 00:00:53,820
You should've called first.

15
00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:57,540
You would've said you were busy, then.

16
00:00:57,540 --> 00:01:01,510
I rarely eat at home. Why did you bring these?

17
00:01:04,120 --> 00:01:07,740
You made it feel like a home, at least.

18
00:01:08,690 --> 00:01:10,120
What's this?

What's this? Is this the closet?

21
00:01:35,120 --> 00:01:36,760
Hold on! Mom! Mom!

22
00:01:36,760 --> 00:01:39,800
Mom, Mom! Hold on. What's that?

23
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:41,400
That, that...

24
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:43,800
- Wh-What do I do with that?
 - What?

25
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:47,250
Should I just put it in the freezer or what?

26
00:01:48,930 --> 00:01:53,280
You don't like it too fresh. Keep the radish kimchi out for a couple of days.

27
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:58,680
I divided up the marinated meat and cut up veggies. Keep them in the freezer...

28
00:02:00,350 --> 00:02:02,950
Never mind. I'll do it.

29
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:16,400
Give it to me. You should've told me to pick it up.

30
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:17,950
You shouldn't have troubled yourself.

31
00:02:17,950 --> 00:02:19,820
I'm glad I did.

32
00:02:20,820 --> 00:02:23,880
- Let me do it.
 - It's okay. I'll do it.

33
00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:28,340
Your brother never shows any gratitude when I bring him stuff.

34
00:02:28,340 --> 00:02:32,640
I coddled him too much since he was the firstborn. He's ruined.

35
00:02:35,170 --> 00:02:37,700
- Mom, here.
 - Okay.

36
00:02:38,790 --> 00:02:40,430
This, too.

37
00:02:40,430 --> 00:02:42,060
Oh, okay.

38
00:02:56,130 --> 00:02:58,580
Wait just a moment.

39
00:03:04,970 --> 00:03:08,570
There isn't anything except beer and water.

40
00:03:08,570 --> 00:03:11,340
- Here, Mom.
 - No, leave that there. Hand me that.

41
00:03:16,230 --> 00:03:17,890
Have you had breakfast?

42
00:03:17,890 --> 00:03:20,530
Gosh, you've got to be kidding.

43
00:03:20,530 --> 00:03:23,270
People think about what to have for lunch now.

44
00:03:23,270 --> 00:03:25,560
Do you like living like this?

45
00:03:27,190 --> 00:03:28,590
Let's go out. I'll buy you lunch.

46
00:03:28,590 --> 00:03:30,390
Geez, hold on.

47
00:03:30,390 --> 00:03:33,200
No, no. Let's go out, I said.

48
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:35,480
It's been less than 10 minutes since I got here.

49
00:03:35,480 --> 00:03:37,800
I want to get you something tasty as soon as possible.

50
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:40,140
It's okay. Where's the bathroom?

51
00:03:40,140 --> 00:03:42,280
What for?

52
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:44,520
Why are you acting so strange?

53
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:46,780
Why do you go to the bathroom?

54
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:51,580
H-Here.

55
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:55,740
Here.

56
00:04:01,700 --> 00:04:04,200
Be careful. Be careful.

57
00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:09,550
J-Just relax. Take your time.

58
00:04:23,790 --> 00:04:25,660
Your coat? Coat?

59
00:04:25,660 --> 00:04:28,000
It's okay. Go.

72
00:05:56,170 --> 00:05:58,350
Why are you standing guard?

73
00:05:58,350 --> 00:06:00,880
I thought you might get lost since the place is too big.

74
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:03,180
Don't be silly.

75
00:06:08,590 --> 00:06:11,540
There isn't much to drink. Should I pick up some juice?

76
00:06:11,540 --> 00:06:13,100
It's okay. Have a seat here.

77
00:06:13,100 --> 00:06:15,510
I came to tell you something.

78
00:06:25,610 --> 00:06:29,010
Dad and I finally did some research

79
00:06:29,010 --> 00:06:31,060
about star lecturers and stuff like that.

80
00:06:31,060 --> 00:06:35,080
Just wait. I'll be known to the whole country soon.

81
00:06:35,080 --> 00:06:37,250
- That'll take forever. 
- It won't be long.

82
00:06:37,250 --> 00:06:40,380
Why don't you try meeting someone?

83
00:06:40,380 --> 00:06:43,300
You know Plan-A Study, right?

84
00:06:43,300 --> 00:06:46,740
Yes, it's the biggest internet lecture company in Korea.

85
00:06:46,740 --> 00:06:49,690
The son of a junior from Dad's old job at the financial company—

86
00:06:49,690 --> 00:06:52,580
That's basically a stranger, Mom.

87
00:06:52,580 --> 00:06:57,560
That son apparently works for a team that hires people,

88
00:06:57,560 --> 00:06:59,910
so Dad mentioned you to him.

89
00:06:59,910 --> 00:07:05,240
He wants you to send your resume and a video of your lecture.

90
00:07:05,860 --> 00:07:08,170
To become a star lecturer,

91
00:07:08,170 --> 00:07:11,170
I heard you have to give entrance exam lectures at companies like that.

92
00:07:11,170 --> 00:07:15,280
What lectures do 12th-graders and exam re-takers take?

93
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:18,100
You can teach online, too.

94
00:07:18,100 --> 00:07:20,230
So?

95
00:07:20,230 --> 00:07:24,800
You apparently join companies like that

96
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:28,090
through connections.

97
00:07:28,090 --> 00:07:30,310
Dad will provide a connection for me?

98
00:07:30,310 --> 00:07:33,250
He worked hard to find one.

99
00:07:34,370 --> 00:07:36,200
I'll turn it down.

100
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,330
My reputation is growing here.

101
00:07:39,330 --> 00:07:41,260
The winter break lecture is almost fully registered, too.

102
00:07:41,260 --> 00:07:42,920
But it's a small academy.

103
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:46,580
I heard star lecturers have millions of students.

104
00:07:46,580 --> 00:07:49,380
When will you become famous and successful at that tiny academy?

105
00:07:49,380 --> 00:07:55,270
Many famous star lecturers started by teaching a handful of students.

106
00:07:55,270 --> 00:07:57,200
I'll grow in popularity here and switch later.

107
00:07:57,200 --> 00:07:58,900
No, no. Stop arguing.

108
00:07:58,900 --> 00:08:02,030
I got his email address. Send him what I mentioned first.

109
00:08:02,030 --> 00:08:04,350
Hold on. My phone. Right.

110
00:08:15,700 --> 00:08:19,610
 My mom will leave soon. Just wait a moment. 

111
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:33,110
I thought I made you unnecessarily handsome,

112
00:08:33,110 --> 00:08:35,740
but I guess that helps, too.

113
00:08:36,530 --> 00:08:39,210
He apparently said you'd come in handy.

114
00:08:39,930 --> 00:08:42,230
Find me the email address.

115
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:50,340
This means Father is acknowledging your plan.

116
00:08:54,190 --> 00:08:58,580
Aigoo. He couldn't just surrender since he's so proud.

117
00:08:58,580 --> 00:09:01,580
So, he found you a position instead.

118
00:09:03,490 --> 00:09:06,440
Your dad got old, too.

119
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:13,160
Why aren't you saying anything? Are you moved?

120
00:09:14,690 --> 00:09:16,140
I'm thinking.

121
00:09:16,140 --> 00:09:20,180
What is there to think about?

122
00:09:20,180 --> 00:09:22,450
Tell him not to schedule a meeting.

123
00:09:22,450 --> 00:09:24,110
I won't prepare for it.

124
00:09:24,110 --> 00:09:26,440
Gosh, you think you're all that.

125
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:28,330
I knew you'd feel embarrassed.

126
00:09:28,330 --> 00:09:30,900
It's not like that.

127
00:09:30,900 --> 00:09:33,420
Saying no won't be polite.

128
00:09:33,420 --> 00:09:35,960
He asked him a favor. It'd make him look bad.

129
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:40,110
Would Dad look good if I met him, you think?

130
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:47,200
I'm about to turn 30, and if I go meet him for a job interview that my dad got me,

131
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:49,760
would that make him look good?

132
00:09:50,970 --> 00:09:54,550
Why are you suddenly talking formally? You're scaring me.

133
00:09:54,550 --> 00:09:55,860
That's not his intention.

134
00:09:55,860 --> 00:10:02,090
I can get that academy to send me a driver and pick me up.

135
00:10:02,090 --> 00:10:05,350
I heard you're at the most desirable age.

136
00:10:05,350 --> 00:10:08,060
Before you get another year older—

137
00:10:26,140 --> 00:10:27,810
Mom.

138
00:10:27,810 --> 00:10:29,460
What?

139
00:10:30,510 --> 00:10:33,690
How much should I put into the time deposit every month?

140
00:10:33,690 --> 00:10:37,840
I don't know. How much do you make now?

141
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:40,060
When should I get married? Huh?

142
00:10:41,460 --> 00:10:43,760
Where should I live after I get married?

143
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:47,160
- Hey.
 - How many kids should I have?

144
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:49,400
Do you want a daughter or a son?

145
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:53,060
I'm thinking of buying a car. Should I buy a new or used one?

146
00:10:53,060 --> 00:10:55,800
Which insurance company should I go with?

147
00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:57,640
Jun Ho.

148
00:10:59,950 --> 00:11:02,660
Am I wrong, or...

149
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:05,750
are you and Dad wrong?

150
00:11:09,130 --> 00:11:11,800
I'll just think I'm wrong for now.

151
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:13,870
I suppose I wasn't trustworthy enough of a son.

152
00:11:13,870 --> 00:11:15,180
No, it's not that—

153
00:11:15,180 --> 00:11:20,140
But if you try to plan my life for me one more time,

154
00:11:21,570 --> 00:11:24,050
I might speak more harshly, then.

155
00:11:24,050 --> 00:11:25,800
If you had kids—

156
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:28,920
I probably wouldn't do as much as you did.

157
00:11:28,920 --> 00:11:32,400
I won't be planning their lives using every minute and second.

158
00:11:34,070 --> 00:11:38,190
So, you should stop now. You don't have to do this.

159
00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:42,510
I don't know why you're like this these days.

160
00:11:42,510 --> 00:11:45,760
- You're upsetting me. 
 - Gosh.

161
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:49,890
Am I sick, can't make money,

162
00:11:49,890 --> 00:11:53,200
beat people up, or got scammed?

163
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:55,830
Why are you upset? Why?

164
00:11:58,400 --> 00:12:01,570
It's because I don't satisfy your greed.

165
00:12:01,570 --> 00:12:04,140
Gosh, you bastard.

166
00:12:04,140 --> 00:12:08,230
Did listening to me ever hurt you?

167
00:12:08,230 --> 00:12:10,190
It didn't.

168
00:12:10,190 --> 00:12:12,020
Thanks to you, I met Ms. Seo, too.

169
00:12:12,020 --> 00:12:15,120
Yes. That's how you went to a good school and got a good job.

170
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:17,600
You got everything you need in life.

171
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:21,600
But you think it's okay to break our hearts like this now?

172
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:23,720
Will you keep going?

173
00:12:25,510 --> 00:12:28,810
If I start arguing with you without going easy on you,

174
00:12:29,640 --> 00:12:31,720
you'll end up crying.

175
00:12:54,730 --> 00:12:58,150
Mom, hit me. Hit me once.

176
00:13:00,250 --> 00:13:02,700
And stop worrying about me.

177
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:08,810
I raised you without slapping your hand once.

178
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:14,300
I'll call Father myself.

179
00:13:14,300 --> 00:13:16,820
Don't bring it up and get yelled at for no reason.

180
00:13:16,820 --> 00:13:19,150
Just tell him I'll call him.

181
00:13:22,070 --> 00:13:25,180
 Reserved 

182
00:14:06,290 --> 00:14:09,640
 There's only one thing you can do. 

183
00:14:10,640 --> 00:14:14,450
 Cheer for him. Fighting! 

184
00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:18,760
Fighting.

185
00:15:09,160 --> 00:15:12,600
 Level 1 is guaranteed - Lee Jun Ho Korean 

186
00:15:16,650 --> 00:15:20,320
 Lee Jun Ho Winter Break Textbook - Final 

187
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:21,910
 Trash 

188
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:26,760
 Empty Trash 

189
00:15:33,410 --> 00:15:37,010
I've been thinking all night.

190
00:15:37,010 --> 00:15:39,230
But I have a bad feeling.

191
00:15:39,230 --> 00:15:41,350
Bad feeling?

192
00:15:41,950 --> 00:15:46,570
The teacher from Chanyeong High that Choeseon Korean hired.

193
00:15:46,570 --> 00:15:48,450
Pyo...

194
00:15:48,450 --> 00:15:50,890
It's Mr. Pyo Sang Seob.

195
00:15:51,560 --> 00:15:55,790
He personally came all the way here, too.

196
00:15:55,790 --> 00:15:58,100
I have a bad feeling.

197
00:15:58,100 --> 00:16:00,860
I think I should meet him sometime

198
00:16:00,860 --> 00:16:03,830
to see if he has a talent we aren't aware of.

199
00:16:03,830 --> 00:16:06,490
He was a schoolteacher for 20 years.

200
00:16:06,490 --> 00:16:10,420
He probably can't compete with the academy teachers.

201
00:16:11,490 --> 00:16:15,300
You know homi*, right?
(Korean hand plow)

202
00:16:16,100 --> 00:16:19,310
Homi. This. Homi.

203
00:16:19,310 --> 00:16:20,460
Yes.

204
00:16:20,460 --> 00:16:23,870
That's apparently really popular in the US.

205
00:16:23,870 --> 00:16:26,380
Everyone has a garden there.

206
00:16:26,380 --> 00:16:30,190
They've been struggling with hand trowels all this time,

207
00:16:30,190 --> 00:16:33,660
but homi changed their lives.

208
00:16:34,730 --> 00:16:38,060
They say the rural blacksmiths in Korea now

209
00:16:38,060 --> 00:16:42,900
are suddenly successful.

210
00:16:42,900 --> 00:16:44,780
Which means...

211
00:16:46,940 --> 00:16:49,090
When it comes to a product,

212
00:16:49,090 --> 00:16:56,980
the value of it depends on who uses it, where, and how.

213
00:16:56,980 --> 00:16:58,480
Jeez.

214
00:17:04,850 --> 00:17:10,920
That Mr. Pyo. Let's hire him if we can.

215
00:17:12,670 --> 00:17:15,460
You can't give him Team Leader Seo's Chanyeong students. Why—

216
00:17:15,460 --> 00:17:20,310
I'll decide how to use Mr. Pyo myself.

217
00:17:20,310 --> 00:17:22,250
By chance,

218
00:17:23,090 --> 00:17:27,170
are you thinking of Team Leader Seo's future?

219
00:17:27,170 --> 00:17:29,610
Will she get a promotion, perhaps?

220
00:17:30,930 --> 00:17:33,570
You aren't disappointed, right?

221
00:17:35,550 --> 00:17:37,870
Because I keep coddling Team Leader Seo

222
00:17:37,870 --> 00:17:40,520
without paying attention to your warning.

223
00:17:41,320 --> 00:17:43,580
I am disappointed.

224
00:17:43,580 --> 00:17:45,130
Pardon?

225
00:17:46,100 --> 00:17:49,400
More than anyone else, I do my job with a sense of ownership.

226
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:52,360
I don't let personal feelings dictate what I do.

227
00:17:54,130 --> 00:17:57,780
Aigoo, I'm disappointed that you interpreted it that way.

228
00:17:58,940 --> 00:18:00,930
I'll be back.

229
00:18:29,860 --> 00:18:34,490
 I'll decide how to use Mr. Pyo myself. 

230
00:18:50,750 --> 00:18:57,390
Yes, I'm Wu Seung Hui, the assistant director of Daechi Chase.

231
00:18:58,490 --> 00:19:01,000
Yes, hello.

232
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:05,420
I'm sorry I'm calling you out of the blue.

233
00:19:22,510 --> 00:19:24,500
What are you guys doing?

234
00:19:46,070 --> 00:19:47,700
What's going on?

235
00:19:47,700 --> 00:19:49,760
Well...

236
00:19:51,160 --> 00:19:53,520
- I can't take this. 
- I'll...

237
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:55,980
I'll do it, Ye Eun.

238
00:19:59,140 --> 00:20:01,240
Well, Mr. Pyo...

239
00:20:04,430 --> 00:20:06,710
 Chanyeong High 10th grade, Seong Ha Yool 

240
00:20:06,710 --> 00:20:09,190
What's this?

241
00:20:09,190 --> 00:20:11,210
It's a reading notebook.

242
00:20:12,440 --> 00:20:15,540
You told us to read a book per semester

243
00:20:16,340 --> 00:20:20,760
during an after-school class.

244
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:23,910
She thought it was homework.

245
00:20:23,910 --> 00:20:26,160
No, it's not like that.

246
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:28,710
I knew it wasn't homework.

247
00:20:28,710 --> 00:20:31,490
- Come on. 
 - It's okay.

248
00:20:31,490 --> 00:20:33,100
Take your time and tell me.

249
00:20:33,100 --> 00:20:39,180
It was too hard to read a book that was long.

250
00:20:39,180 --> 00:20:42,580
Instead, I read a few short ones.

251
00:20:44,610 --> 00:20:47,660
How did you choose which ones to read?

252
00:20:47,660 --> 00:20:54,990
You added a list at the end of the textbook.

253
00:20:59,830 --> 00:21:01,460
Do I...

254
00:21:03,180 --> 00:21:07,090
need to write about this in your transcript?

255
00:21:07,090 --> 00:21:10,930
No, it's not that.

256
00:21:10,930 --> 00:21:17,160
I was wondering if you could give me feedback.

257
00:21:18,540 --> 00:21:23,170
You don't need my feedback.

258
00:21:24,530 --> 00:21:26,110
I'm sorry.

259
00:21:26,110 --> 00:21:29,590
I don't know anyone who could do it for me.

260
00:21:29,590 --> 00:21:32,060
I felt anxious, so...

261
00:21:32,060 --> 00:21:33,880
Leave it there.

262
00:21:34,500 --> 00:21:36,550
I'll have a look at it.

263
00:21:39,850 --> 00:21:41,780
Do you want me to make notes?

264
00:21:41,780 --> 00:21:45,730
I'd really appreciate it.

265
00:21:46,750 --> 00:21:49,670
Okay. You can leave.

266
00:21:54,410 --> 00:21:56,170
Seong Ha Yul.

267
00:21:59,310 --> 00:22:02,150
- Yes?
 - Good work.

268
00:22:20,330 --> 00:22:23,470
I think Sang Seop was moved.

269
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:32,710
 Chanyeong High 10th grade, Seong Ha Yul 

270
00:22:43,790 --> 00:22:45,990
Where are you going, Mr. Pyo?

271
00:22:47,470 --> 00:22:50,210
I'm meeting someone.

272
00:22:50,210 --> 00:22:52,220
It won't take long.

273
00:25:24,130 --> 00:25:25,770
 Yes. 

274
00:25:34,510 --> 00:25:36,800
Are you Assistant Director Wu?

275
00:25:36,800 --> 00:25:38,300
Yes.

276
00:25:38,300 --> 00:25:41,540
Come on in. She's waiting for you

277
00:25:44,030 --> 00:25:48,150
Welcome, Director. I'm Choi Hyeong Seon.

278
00:25:48,150 --> 00:25:52,090
I'm Wu Seung Hui. And I'm an assistant director, not a director.

279
00:25:52,090 --> 00:25:54,310
I remember you as a director...

280
00:25:54,310 --> 00:25:58,070
of Victory Academy, the former Daechi Chase.

281
00:26:00,790 --> 00:26:02,780
Shall we?

282
00:26:28,500 --> 00:26:30,570
Are you nervous...

283
00:26:30,570 --> 00:26:36,530
because I wanted to see you in your secret private classroom?

284
00:26:36,530 --> 00:26:38,170
A little.

285
00:26:38,170 --> 00:26:39,560
Don't be nervous.

286
00:26:39,560 --> 00:26:43,360
I just wanted to see you where no one can see us.

287
00:26:43,360 --> 00:26:47,370
That makes me even more nervous.

288
00:26:49,530 --> 00:26:54,100
Director Kim told me to meet Mr. Pyo.

289
00:26:54,100 --> 00:26:57,340
To find out if he has a talent we aren't aware of.

290
00:26:59,970 --> 00:27:03,020
Why didn't you go to see Mr. Pyo, then?

291
00:27:03,020 --> 00:27:04,660
I needed to confirm something.

292
00:27:04,660 --> 00:27:06,260
Confirm?

293
00:27:07,260 --> 00:27:13,850
We might have different purposes, but we share the same goal.

294
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:19,170
I'm not sure what you mean. The same goal?

295
00:27:22,690 --> 00:27:24,620
Seo Hye Jin.

296
00:27:32,740 --> 00:27:36,430
I'll tell the TA to get us some tea.

297
00:28:02,660 --> 00:28:04,380
I'm sorry.

298
00:28:04,380 --> 00:28:06,430
You went through a lot.

299
00:28:06,430 --> 00:28:08,190
I'm sorry.

300
00:28:10,020 --> 00:28:12,160
It's okay.

301
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:15,380
You should've taken your mom home. I'm really okay.

302
00:28:15,380 --> 00:28:17,680
I'm not okay.

303
00:28:18,690 --> 00:28:20,500
I'll get you some coffee.

304
00:28:27,660 --> 00:28:29,940
I said I can do it.

305
00:28:35,700 --> 00:28:38,380
"I'm okay. I don't care.

306
00:28:38,380 --> 00:28:40,280
I'll do it."

307
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:46,360
I don't know how it feels to say those things,

308
00:28:46,360 --> 00:28:49,060
but it makes me sad sometimes.

309
00:28:53,430 --> 00:28:55,300
Geez, did I upset you?

310
00:28:57,820 --> 00:29:00,040
I guess it's a habit.

311
00:29:07,210 --> 00:29:12,070
You're trying to do something regarding Mr. Pyo without telling me, right?

312
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:24,910
He said he'll have a free lecture.

313
00:29:24,910 --> 00:29:28,820
He'll probably prepare something completely different from his school material.

314
00:29:28,820 --> 00:29:32,660
I thought I should let the students take it and decide.

315
00:29:32,660 --> 00:29:35,210
That's what I've been thinking.

316
00:29:35,210 --> 00:29:36,820
That's nonsense.

317
00:29:37,620 --> 00:29:43,040
Director Choi once told me that she and I share something in common.

318
00:29:43,040 --> 00:29:45,180
Seriously. Come on.

319
00:29:45,180 --> 00:29:46,710
She makes me so angry.

320
00:29:46,710 --> 00:29:50,900
If I were Director Choi, I'd assume Mr. Pyo would not last that long.

321
00:29:50,900 --> 00:29:52,860
Two years tops?

322
00:29:53,660 --> 00:29:56,960
- That won't be good. 
- So?

323
00:29:56,960 --> 00:30:00,690
Should I send a group message to my students and promote it?

324
00:30:00,690 --> 00:30:04,020
Or should I kneel in front of him at school?

325
00:30:04,020 --> 00:30:06,410
Or should I just tell him to join our academy?

326
00:30:06,410 --> 00:30:07,830
I'm still thinking about it.

327
00:30:07,830 --> 00:30:09,970
Didn't you hear what I said?

328
00:30:09,970 --> 00:30:11,790
If you make the academy lose even a penny—

329
00:30:11,790 --> 00:30:14,140
I know, I know. I know, but

330
00:30:14,140 --> 00:30:18,510
it's hard to let him win even if I wanted to. That's my concern.

331
00:30:18,510 --> 00:30:21,960
I've had Chanyeong High in my palms since you were a student.

332
00:30:21,960 --> 00:30:24,180
They're too loyal to me.

333
00:30:24,180 --> 00:30:26,410
Si Wu switched.

334
00:30:26,410 --> 00:30:28,820
He betrayed Choeseon Korean, which dominated Huiwon High for 20 years.

335
00:30:28,820 --> 00:30:32,660
We just got lucky in that case.

336
00:30:32,660 --> 00:30:35,190
I don't think it was luck.

337
00:30:36,600 --> 00:30:40,500
None of the things I've achieved since I met you

338
00:30:41,110 --> 00:30:43,640
were due to luck.

339
00:30:45,490 --> 00:30:48,650
Seo Hye Jin is a clever person.

340
00:30:48,650 --> 00:30:51,470
She's quick and talented.

341
00:30:51,470 --> 00:30:55,150
I'm jealous you have a teacher like that.

342
00:30:55,150 --> 00:30:58,450
Except, she's a bit rude.

343
00:30:58,450 --> 00:31:00,590
She has no fear, either.

344
00:31:01,300 --> 00:31:04,700
I've been doing this job for 20 years.

345
00:31:04,700 --> 00:31:11,700
I haven't seen a teacher who isn't a jerk with that many students.

346
00:31:16,470 --> 00:31:21,870
Did you hire Mr. Pyo to stop Seo Hye Jin from being a jerk?

347
00:31:21,870 --> 00:31:24,920
No, I'm a salesperson.

348
00:31:24,920 --> 00:31:29,280
Growing students is all I want.

349
00:31:30,780 --> 00:31:34,420
"You haven't seen the best of Korean lectures."

350
00:31:37,020 --> 00:31:42,600
If I saw the copy in advance, I never would've put that out on the streets.

351
00:31:42,600 --> 00:31:44,840
Seo Hye Jin definitely crossed the line.

352
00:31:44,840 --> 00:31:50,230
She has no respect for an industry senior or business ethics.

353
00:31:52,180 --> 00:31:55,270
When you suppressed your pride and offered her a job,

354
00:31:55,270 --> 00:31:57,340
you must've promised her the best terms.

355
00:31:57,340 --> 00:32:01,120
But I'm sure she was quite arrogant, turning you down, knowing her personality.

356
00:32:01,120 --> 00:32:03,350
I know her well.

357
00:32:04,630 --> 00:32:08,130
I'd never forgive her.

358
00:32:08,130 --> 00:32:10,690
I can't dwell in the past.

359
00:32:10,690 --> 00:32:13,370
You forgave someone, too.

360
00:32:13,370 --> 00:32:16,760
You work for Director Kim, who's much younger.

361
00:32:17,870 --> 00:32:22,870
The story of him destroying Victory and buying it dirt cheap.

362
00:32:22,870 --> 00:32:25,270
Everyone has heard of it.

363
00:32:25,270 --> 00:32:29,530
It must've been painful, but you endured it well.

364
00:32:30,330 --> 00:32:35,400
But I tend to dwell in the past a bit.

365
00:32:37,260 --> 00:32:40,020
I'm thinking of going back to my old position.

366
00:32:42,060 --> 00:32:44,940
You've hung in there long enough. Has it been seven years?

367
00:32:44,940 --> 00:32:46,380
Nine years.

368
00:32:46,380 --> 00:32:49,310
It's been exactly eight years and seven months.

369
00:32:49,310 --> 00:32:52,310
Gosh, time flies.

370
00:32:52,310 --> 00:32:56,860
You'd have to steal at least half of his students, then.

371
00:32:57,760 --> 00:32:59,840
That won't be enough.

372
00:32:59,840 --> 00:33:02,490
If you add the interest, too.

373
00:33:09,810 --> 00:33:12,890
Seo Hye Jin's curriculum for the past 10 years,

374
00:33:12,890 --> 00:33:17,010
references, sample questions, exam files, teachers' exam style,

375
00:33:17,010 --> 00:33:20,650
textbook files, and counseling notes. It's all in here.

376
00:33:21,620 --> 00:33:23,980
There are phone numbers of her former TAs, too.

377
00:33:23,980 --> 00:33:26,840
And the information is current.

378
00:33:29,310 --> 00:33:34,650
You brought Seo Hye Jin's head.

379
00:33:34,650 --> 00:33:38,770
It's not that easy to cut her head off, unfortunately.

380
00:33:38,770 --> 00:33:41,640
- That's true.
 - But...

381
00:33:42,270 --> 00:33:46,590
I thought it might be possible now.

382
00:33:46,590 --> 00:33:50,400
She's not the same as she used to be.

383
00:33:50,400 --> 00:33:55,130
She gave up the ad modeling gig, gave a free lecture,

384
00:33:55,130 --> 00:33:59,330
and she skipped all of her classes one weekend, too.

385
00:34:09,630 --> 00:34:12,370
I'm curious about two things.

386
00:34:13,540 --> 00:34:15,620
Yes, feel free to ask.

387
00:34:15,620 --> 00:34:20,780
Firstly, why are you cutting off her head?

388
00:34:20,780 --> 00:34:24,080
Isn't defeating Director Kim your goal?

389
00:34:24,080 --> 00:34:28,030
No matter how much I shake things up at the academy,

390
00:34:28,030 --> 00:34:34,000
it's only a matter of time for him to get back up if Seo Hye Jin is still safe.

391
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:38,980
We forcefully gave her students to another teacher once.

392
00:34:38,980 --> 00:34:42,150
But she wasn't affected at all.

393
00:34:42,150 --> 00:34:46,210
No, she actually turned into an angry, venomous snake.

394
00:34:46,210 --> 00:34:47,920
It motivated her even more.

395
00:34:47,920 --> 00:34:52,380
She needs to be... cut off completely.

396
00:34:54,440 --> 00:34:58,120
What's the reason you're giving this to me?

397
00:34:59,960 --> 00:35:03,530
To be clear, I'm giving it to Mr. Pyo, not you.

398
00:35:03,530 --> 00:35:07,520
I thought he'd make the most out of it.

399
00:35:07,520 --> 00:35:12,880
You and I are competitors in the long run.

400
00:35:12,880 --> 00:35:16,960
It wouldn't be good for me if you had something like this.

401
00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:21,770
If Mr. Pyo comes to see me, I'll let him have a look at the files.

402
00:35:21,770 --> 00:35:24,970
Tell him to keep the information in his head.

403
00:35:27,070 --> 00:35:33,120
What would happen if I told Director Kim about this?

404
00:35:40,920 --> 00:35:44,420
You'd suffer a huge loss, probably.

405
00:35:44,420 --> 00:35:47,700
You'll have to evacuate from this building first.

406
00:35:47,700 --> 00:35:51,870
You won't be able to keep the academy building, either.

407
00:35:57,490 --> 00:36:02,920
But I don't think we don't deserve this gift.

408
00:36:02,920 --> 00:36:08,050
Are you sure we just need to defeat Seo Hye Jin?

409
00:36:10,420 --> 00:36:12,220
Of course.

410
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:01,180
Let's go.

411
00:37:01,180 --> 00:37:05,200
Thinking about it, you need to print the textbook soon. There's no time.

412
00:37:07,670 --> 00:37:09,300
What's wrong?

413
00:37:10,700 --> 00:37:13,070
It's nothing. Let's go.

414
00:37:15,360 --> 00:37:17,730
You're acting kind of strange today.

415
00:37:19,910 --> 00:37:22,220
You probably won't hang out with me for a while.

416
00:37:22,220 --> 00:37:24,180
So, I was just looking at you.

417
00:37:26,820 --> 00:37:29,320
Don't worry about Mr. Pyo so much.

418
00:37:29,320 --> 00:37:31,490
I can manage myself.

419
00:37:34,790 --> 00:37:36,210
Okay.

420
00:37:52,660 --> 00:37:54,580
Thanks for the food.

421
00:37:55,740 --> 00:37:59,980
I'm returning the favor since you drove me last time. Don't thank me.

422
00:38:00,750 --> 00:38:03,170
Do you not like the school cafeteria food?

423
00:38:03,170 --> 00:38:05,440
I don't dislike it.

424
00:38:05,440 --> 00:38:09,030
I was grateful for it when I was a student.

425
00:38:09,030 --> 00:38:11,220
I suppose you weren't doing so well.

426
00:38:12,320 --> 00:38:15,240
Why would you ask something like that so casually?

427
00:38:16,560 --> 00:38:18,710
The question was in the past tense.

428
00:38:20,540 --> 00:38:23,980
I'm not doing well now. You're better off than me.

429
00:38:23,980 --> 00:38:25,690
I've been curious about something.

430
00:38:25,690 --> 00:38:27,080
What is it?

431
00:38:27,080 --> 00:38:29,610
Do you regret choosing to study?

432
00:38:31,590 --> 00:38:36,730
Nine out of ten people would regret it by now, but I don't really.

433
00:38:36,730 --> 00:38:39,010
Because your parents are well off?

434
00:38:39,010 --> 00:38:40,880
Since you won't be starving?

435
00:38:40,880 --> 00:38:43,140
It's not like that.

436
00:38:44,130 --> 00:38:46,660
If I give up on marriage or raising a child,

437
00:38:46,660 --> 00:38:51,600
I can feed myself, at least.

438
00:38:51,600 --> 00:38:54,410
Is that why you gave up on dating, too?

439
00:38:56,470 --> 00:38:58,530
What do you mean?

440
00:38:58,530 --> 00:39:01,040
I still want to date.

441
00:39:01,040 --> 00:39:02,820
Never mind, then.

442
00:39:05,850 --> 00:39:08,090
There's someone I'm interested in, too.

443
00:39:08,090 --> 00:39:10,530
I didn't ask.

444
00:39:10,530 --> 00:39:14,750
I heard she's about three years older than me.

445
00:39:17,070 --> 00:39:20,070
But she's apparently not interested in younger men.

446
00:39:20,070 --> 00:39:22,410
So I'm doing my best poking at her.

447
00:39:23,580 --> 00:39:25,660
Buying her cafeteria food and all.

448
00:39:40,580 --> 00:39:42,860
You should try going out with me.

449
00:39:43,750 --> 00:39:48,420
I can't buy you expensive meals, but I can keep you entertained.

450
00:39:49,220 --> 00:39:51,730
What if I crave expensive meals?

451
00:39:53,910 --> 00:39:56,410
Let's have Lee Jun Ho treat us.

452
00:39:56,410 --> 00:39:59,050
I'm holding something over his head.

453
00:39:59,050 --> 00:40:05,360
This won't reach the director. The assistant director won't approve it.

454
00:40:05,360 --> 00:40:09,220
Some academies start a class with a minimum of two students.

455
00:40:09,220 --> 00:40:11,710
The minimum number I'm requesting is four.

456
00:40:11,710 --> 00:40:15,490
You know we're even splitting up bigger classes right now.

457
00:40:15,490 --> 00:40:17,370
We don't have enough classrooms.

458
00:40:17,370 --> 00:40:20,100
We might not have enough, but we have some.

459
00:40:22,470 --> 00:40:27,040
We don't teach small classes.

460
00:40:27,040 --> 00:40:29,330
I think you know why.

461
00:40:31,160 --> 00:40:35,660
The new teachers will be on monthly salary for the first year, right?

462
00:40:35,660 --> 00:40:38,820
You're getting paid quite a bit regardless of the number of students.

463
00:40:38,820 --> 00:40:43,400
It won't pay for the classroom usage fee or your wage.

464
00:40:43,400 --> 00:40:45,570
You use a lot of paper, too.

465
00:40:45,570 --> 00:40:47,060
I'm not saying I'd teach only four students.

466
00:40:47,060 --> 00:40:50,450
I want to start a class with a minimum of four students.

467
00:40:50,450 --> 00:40:54,190
There's a class I want to teach. I'm confident I can make it grow, too.

468
00:40:55,410 --> 00:40:57,540
What do you want to do?

469
00:40:57,540 --> 00:40:59,340
I want to teach a great class.

470
00:41:04,730 --> 00:41:07,000
I believe you, but—

471
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:10,940
I don't need a window. I don't mind one tucked away in the corner, either.

472
00:41:12,230 --> 00:41:15,110
This would be a headache.

473
00:41:15,110 --> 00:41:18,420
I'll need a classroom to ask the higher-ups.

474
00:41:19,100 --> 00:41:24,350
I wouldn't understand what you want to teach, anyway.

475
00:41:24,350 --> 00:41:27,720
Why don't you try writing it down?

476
00:41:27,720 --> 00:41:33,670
You should write something down for formality to satisfy the higher-ups.

477
00:41:33,670 --> 00:41:36,420
- Okay. 
 - What do you call it?

478
00:41:36,420 --> 00:41:38,830
Make it look serious.

479
00:41:38,830 --> 00:41:43,110
I don't get that many free days like this per year.

480
00:41:43,110 --> 00:41:46,440
I only have time before the school breaks.

481
00:41:46,440 --> 00:41:50,310
You probably know I normally have to be a night owl.

482
00:41:51,700 --> 00:41:55,860
Do you know what strength academic people have?

483
00:41:55,860 --> 00:41:57,980
We keep ourselves entertained.

484
00:42:04,260 --> 00:42:05,680
What is it?

485
00:42:05,680 --> 00:42:07,690
It's an alarm.

486
00:42:07,690 --> 00:42:11,200
Do you have to take pills at a certain time or something?

487
00:42:11,200 --> 00:42:14,560
No. My free time ends now.

488
00:42:14,560 --> 00:42:15,960
Pardon?

489
00:42:17,430 --> 00:42:21,260
We were having a very important talk. You want to stop?

490
00:42:21,260 --> 00:42:24,530
I need to do the last proofreading before we print the textbook.

491
00:42:28,690 --> 00:42:33,110
I thought I was pretty good at surprising people.

492
00:42:33,110 --> 00:42:35,070
Hang out by yourself.

493
00:42:35,070 --> 00:42:36,980
You said you were good at it.

494
00:42:38,410 --> 00:42:41,380
I'll go. No, don't get up.

495
00:42:43,300 --> 00:42:46,200
I'm good at proofreading, too.

496
00:42:46,200 --> 00:42:49,820
I've proofread thousands of pages of theses for professors.

497
00:42:54,430 --> 00:42:57,880
 Chanyeong High 10th grade, Seong Ha Yul 

498
00:43:12,180 --> 00:43:13,780
Aren't you leaving?

499
00:43:15,700 --> 00:43:17,160
Pardon?

500
00:43:18,530 --> 00:43:20,210
I am.

501
00:43:22,380 --> 00:43:26,770
The principal will want to have a one-on-one tomorrow.

502
00:43:26,770 --> 00:43:28,220
Okay.

503
00:43:33,010 --> 00:43:35,430
Should we go get a drink?

504
00:43:36,800 --> 00:43:40,930
I'll treat you next time.

505
00:43:40,930 --> 00:43:44,050
I have more work to do today.

506
00:43:44,050 --> 00:43:45,650
Okay.

507
00:43:49,760 --> 00:43:53,190
 Chanyeong High 10th grade, Seong Ha Yul 

508
00:43:53,190 --> 00:43:58,740
 I'll try reading one book per semester! 

509
00:44:12,620 --> 00:44:14,590
Hello?

510
00:44:18,040 --> 00:44:23,140
 Mr. Pyo made the decision himself. 

511
00:44:23,140 --> 00:44:25,810
 All I did was give him the opportunity. 

512
00:44:25,810 --> 00:44:27,030
Opportunity.

513
00:44:27,030 --> 00:44:28,850
Yes, are you here?

514
00:44:28,850 --> 00:44:31,600
Come to the fifth floor. Okay.

515
00:44:31,600 --> 00:44:34,760
Yay! It's here. It's here.

516
00:44:34,760 --> 00:44:37,140
The draft of the textbooks for Mr. Lee and me.

517
00:44:37,140 --> 00:44:39,040
I'll be right back.

518
00:44:59,770 --> 00:45:01,360
What are you doing?

519
00:45:02,910 --> 00:45:05,100
I was looking at the textbook.

520
00:45:06,210 --> 00:45:09,240
Those files...

521
00:45:09,240 --> 00:45:13,340
They shouldn't be shown to others, and you shouldn't see them, right?

522
00:45:14,690 --> 00:45:16,510
Assistant Director.

523
00:45:17,170 --> 00:45:18,640
Yes.

524
00:45:19,360 --> 00:45:25,040
I think you need to assess your situation objectively.

525
00:45:26,890 --> 00:45:29,340
Just think about it.

526
00:45:29,340 --> 00:45:36,210
An older male teacher who would've stayed at the school until retiring.

527
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:41,280
He's been attacked by an academy teacher,

528
00:45:41,280 --> 00:45:44,270
but now he's challenging her.

529
00:45:44,270 --> 00:45:46,510
In the academy industry, even.

530
00:45:47,210 --> 00:45:50,320
His first opponent is Seo Hye Jin.

531
00:45:50,320 --> 00:45:54,540
She teaches about 300 Chanyeong High students every year.

532
00:45:54,540 --> 00:45:59,420
The students here are known for being picky, but they practically worship her.

533
00:45:59,420 --> 00:46:03,800
I understand my situation and what I'm supposed to do, at least.

534
00:46:03,800 --> 00:46:06,420
- Really?
 - Yes.

535
00:46:06,420 --> 00:46:09,110
That's why I'm doing my best to prepare for my class—

536
00:46:11,980 --> 00:46:15,060
I don't think you do.

537
00:46:17,440 --> 00:46:22,430
Of course, you need to do your best to prepare for it.

538
00:46:23,330 --> 00:46:26,580
What do you mean, then...

539
00:46:27,180 --> 00:46:30,360
Your job is to win.

540
00:46:30,360 --> 00:46:33,080
Ninety-nine percent won't be enough.

541
00:46:33,080 --> 00:46:35,410
You need to win 100%.

542
00:46:37,640 --> 00:46:42,660
You can't be so naive to think you just need to

543
00:46:42,660 --> 00:46:46,270
work hard to get good results, right?

544
00:46:46,270 --> 00:46:50,720
I have enough class material myself.

545
00:47:28,720 --> 00:47:30,660
What's this?

546
00:47:30,660 --> 00:47:36,110
The one on the left is Chanyeong's second-semester finals exam question for 10th grade.

547
00:47:36,110 --> 00:47:40,480
The one on the right is the question predicted by Seo Hye Jin.

548
00:47:40,480 --> 00:47:43,760
This wasn't in the textbook, workbook, or handouts.

549
00:47:43,760 --> 00:47:47,630
She predicted a wildcard question.

550
00:47:47,630 --> 00:47:50,130
The question is a little different,

551
00:47:50,130 --> 00:47:54,340
but imagine how excited the students must've been when they saw this.

552
00:47:55,450 --> 00:48:00,660
And imagine how many students she gained from this.

553
00:48:00,660 --> 00:48:03,580
Things like this happen almost every semester.

554
00:48:03,580 --> 00:48:10,460
Do you finally understand what kind of person your opponent is?

555
00:48:13,280 --> 00:48:17,780
- Yes.
 - That's what those files mean.

556
00:48:17,780 --> 00:48:21,180
School exam trends, entrance exam patterns,

557
00:48:21,180 --> 00:48:25,200
the school teacher's exam style, the evolution of the teacher's style,

558
00:48:25,200 --> 00:48:27,810
and private mock test questions.

559
00:48:27,810 --> 00:48:30,190
All of that must be in there.

560
00:48:30,190 --> 00:48:35,490
Of course, you'd understand her exam prediction process, too.

561
00:48:36,600 --> 00:48:41,170
But... this is cheating.

562
00:48:42,050 --> 00:48:44,220
It's only cheating if the referee sees it.

563
00:48:44,220 --> 00:48:48,870
Who would call it cheating if no one knows?

564
00:48:54,400 --> 00:49:00,480
I scared Seo Hye Jin quite a bit recently.

565
00:49:00,480 --> 00:49:05,030
I told her you'd be a great threat.

566
00:49:12,150 --> 00:49:16,900
Go to that place written there at midnight tonight.

567
00:49:16,900 --> 00:49:20,580
Assistant Director Wu will be waiting there.

568
00:49:29,190 --> 00:49:30,660
- Where are you going?
 - To the library.

569
00:49:30,660 --> 00:49:33,540
I'll check the new teachers' textbooks for the last time.

570
00:49:33,540 --> 00:49:36,030
They can manage it themselves. Why do you help them?

571
00:49:36,030 --> 00:49:38,960
There's no rule against it.

572
00:49:38,960 --> 00:49:40,820
Why are you throwing this away?

573
00:49:40,820 --> 00:49:42,610
I don't need it.

574
00:49:42,610 --> 00:49:47,320
Hold on. We can print this the day after tomorrow.

575
00:49:47,320 --> 00:49:49,740
Why are you discarding the draft?

576
00:49:49,740 --> 00:49:53,130
I don't need it. I'll restart from scratch.

577
00:49:53,130 --> 00:49:55,290
But why?

578
00:49:55,290 --> 00:50:00,140
Because you can get 100,000 textbooks like this in Daechi-dong.

579
00:50:01,140 --> 00:50:03,850
No, hold on. Hold on.

580
00:50:05,250 --> 00:50:07,150
Why are you doing this?

581
00:50:08,960 --> 00:50:12,790
 The beginning of modern literature 

582
00:50:12,790 --> 00:50:16,590
 Diverse nature of short stories 

583
00:50:22,600 --> 00:50:28,370
 1930s: During the Japanese colonial period... 

584
00:50:28,370 --> 00:50:33,870
 A modernist novel about the anguish of an intellectual 

585
00:50:33,870 --> 00:50:39,580
 The first novel on generations of a family 

586
00:50:39,580 --> 00:50:45,420
 Yeom Sang Seob's "Three Generations" 

587
00:51:06,360 --> 00:51:09,760
I don't normally get angry,

588
00:51:09,760 --> 00:51:12,050
but I almost died from anger yesterday.

589
00:51:12,050 --> 00:51:14,180
What happened yesterday?

590
00:51:14,180 --> 00:51:18,180
I barged into the Choeseon Korean director's office and got beaten up.

591
00:51:18,180 --> 00:51:19,970
Pardon?

592
00:51:19,970 --> 00:51:22,850
Don't worry. I was beaten up verbally.

593
00:51:22,850 --> 00:51:27,760
I was so angry to hear what she said to you.

594
00:51:27,760 --> 00:51:29,450
I thought, "Okay, fine.

595
00:51:29,450 --> 00:51:32,040
You sabotaged our free lecture, hired a school teacher,

596
00:51:32,040 --> 00:51:36,270
talk nonsense, and try to be clever. Keep trying.

597
00:51:36,270 --> 00:51:39,910
The students care about the class quality. That's how we'll pay you back."

598
00:51:40,980 --> 00:51:42,920
And I opened the textbook file.

599
00:51:42,920 --> 00:51:45,090
Yes, and?

600
00:51:45,890 --> 00:51:48,450
I didn't think it'd be enough.

601
00:51:49,660 --> 00:51:51,980
No, no. You did a good job.

602
00:51:51,980 --> 00:51:53,400
The class is starting very soon.

603
00:51:53,400 --> 00:51:56,410
Call the printer and ask for another one. If they send it now—

604
00:51:56,410 --> 00:51:58,410
I'll make a new textbook.

605
00:51:58,410 --> 00:52:00,690
There's no time.

606
00:52:00,690 --> 00:52:03,370
I don't need a cool design or high-quality copy.

607
00:52:03,370 --> 00:52:04,950
I didn't study with one like that, either.

608
00:52:04,950 --> 00:52:07,780
Think about how shabby your first textbook was.

609
00:52:07,780 --> 00:52:10,980
- Mr. Lee.
 - Si Wu told us

610
00:52:10,980 --> 00:52:13,280
that he doesn't feel fully prepared for Korean, unlike other subjects.

611
00:52:13,280 --> 00:52:16,580
He said he feels anxious somehow.

612
00:52:16,580 --> 00:52:19,170
Mr. Lee, it's because he's still a 10th grader.

613
00:52:19,170 --> 00:52:22,110
We can't get rid of their anxiety in the same old way.

614
00:52:22,110 --> 00:52:24,810
It's not the same old way. It's the proper way.

615
00:52:24,810 --> 00:52:26,780
I changed my perfect score strategy.

616
00:52:26,780 --> 00:52:29,740
It worked on me when I was in both Levels 8 and 1.

617
00:52:29,740 --> 00:52:32,070
What's he saying?

618
00:52:32,070 --> 00:52:34,130
I'll teach them how to read.

619
00:52:34,130 --> 00:52:38,000
They need to grow muscles to fight the text one-on-one.

620
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:41,590
We need to face it head-on instead of learning trivial skills.

621
00:52:41,590 --> 00:52:45,570
I can make them read and find the answer intuitively.

622
00:52:45,570 --> 00:52:48,240
They just need to follow me patiently.

623
00:52:48,240 --> 00:52:51,140
The ones with poor grades will grow

624
00:52:51,140 --> 00:52:54,810
and the ones with good grades can take the exam with confidence.

625
00:52:54,810 --> 00:52:57,590
Don't be so unrealistic.

626
00:52:57,590 --> 00:53:01,700
The smart ones will probably appreciate me as their teacher.

627
00:53:01,700 --> 00:53:05,170
They'll understand it'd become an asset for their lifetime.

628
00:53:07,120 --> 00:53:10,140
 You probably won't hang out with me for a while. 

629
00:53:13,120 --> 00:53:16,500
Looks like you got confused because of me.

630
00:53:16,500 --> 00:53:19,420
I'm sorry. I shouldn't have told you all that.

631
00:53:19,420 --> 00:53:22,390
Yes, it can look boring if you keep looking at it.

632
00:53:22,390 --> 00:53:24,350
Send me the file. I'll have a look.

633
00:53:24,350 --> 00:53:26,000
Stop saying you'd do something for me.

634
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:29,600
Okay, okay. Let's review together. Send me the file first.

635
00:53:29,600 --> 00:53:31,370
I deleted it.

636
00:53:32,260 --> 00:53:33,910
Stop joking.

637
00:53:33,910 --> 00:53:36,690
- I'm serious. 
- Lee Jun Ho!

638
00:53:44,350 --> 00:53:45,690
Hold on. Hold on.

639
00:53:45,690 --> 00:53:47,610
Team Leader.

640
00:53:47,610 --> 00:53:49,740
Most of the draft is intact.

641
00:53:49,740 --> 00:53:53,750
The printer has a file on its cloud, too. We can recover those.

642
00:53:53,750 --> 00:53:56,480
Do you think teaching is a joke?

643
00:53:56,480 --> 00:53:58,800
- Hold on. Hold on. 
- I'm saying it's not a joke.

644
00:53:58,800 --> 00:54:02,400
You destroyed the textbook you worked on the entire semester. You say it's not a joke?

645
00:54:02,400 --> 00:54:04,940
I need a new curriculum to teach properly.

646
00:54:04,940 --> 00:54:06,650
- Stop being so emotional. 
- Let's go back in.

647
00:54:06,650 --> 00:54:10,520
Be responsible. The asset of a lifetime, my foot.

648
00:54:10,520 --> 00:54:12,160
Don't look down on me.

649
00:54:12,160 --> 00:54:14,810
What do you mean by the ability to read?

650
00:54:14,810 --> 00:54:16,170
Go into politics if you want.

651
00:54:16,170 --> 00:54:17,790
Or take the civil service exam since you're good at studying.

652
00:54:17,790 --> 00:54:19,210
Can you talk without mocking me?

653
00:54:19,210 --> 00:54:21,070
It's like you're saying you'd abolish the entrance exam!

654
00:54:21,070 --> 00:54:24,370
How about you? Will you follow the students to the exam site?

655
00:54:24,370 --> 00:54:27,790
What if memorizing, skills, and predicted questions don't work?

656
00:54:27,790 --> 00:54:32,450
Will you comfort them and help them solve the question?

657
00:54:32,450 --> 00:54:36,800
Unless they have the ability to understand the text themselves, you can't guarantee Level 1.

658
00:54:36,800 --> 00:54:41,110
You're saying there's no clear answer in Korean, then.

659
00:54:41,110 --> 00:54:44,500
I'm not interested in dealing with people one by one who say that.

660
00:54:44,500 --> 00:54:48,750
The school teachers evaluate the school exams, and the evaluation institute evaluates the entrance exam.

661
00:54:48,750 --> 00:54:50,570
You just said they should follow you patiently.

662
00:54:50,570 --> 00:54:52,300
Why are they arguing about something so grand?

663
00:54:52,300 --> 00:54:53,960
It's impossible to achieve results...

664
00:54:53,960 --> 00:54:57,200
Mr. Lee is even cooler when he's defiant.

665
00:54:57,200 --> 00:54:58,590
How many exams are there in a year?

666
00:54:58,590 --> 00:55:01,470
Mock exam, midterm, another mock exam, and finals. They repeat every semester.

667
00:55:01,470 --> 00:55:04,900
The Team Leader is saying "you" too much. They're both lecturers in the end.

668
00:55:04,900 --> 00:55:07,830
The grades follow them for the rest of their lives!

669
00:55:07,830 --> 00:55:11,910
You need to achieve a visible result quickly.

670
00:55:11,910 --> 00:55:14,760
You brag about attending an elite college, don't you?

671
00:55:18,170 --> 00:55:19,220
I never have.

672
00:55:19,220 --> 00:55:22,230
Using that title, you worked for a corporation, joined the academy,

673
00:55:22,230 --> 00:55:24,980
and, what is it,  you can move on to something else if you want to, right?

674
00:55:24,980 --> 00:55:29,090
You know the diploma is a status symbol that follows you your whole life.

675
00:55:29,090 --> 00:55:32,730
Each question determines their social status. What are you talking about?

676
00:55:32,730 --> 00:55:35,980
Getting another Korean question right?

677
00:55:35,980 --> 00:55:37,000
That's not my goal.

678
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:40,900
My goal is to help them get better grades in other subjects, too.

679
00:55:40,900 --> 00:55:42,300
Teach elementary schoolers, then.

680
00:55:42,300 --> 00:55:44,730
Teach Korean, math, social studies, and science. Teach music and PE, too!

681
00:55:44,730 --> 00:55:48,880
Think about why you were the most important teacher of my life.

682
00:55:52,520 --> 00:55:56,730
My grades in every subject improved while learning from you.

683
00:55:56,730 --> 00:56:00,590
You know better than anyone how that was possible.

684
00:56:00,590 --> 00:56:03,680
Our subject is the foundation of everything.

685
00:56:03,680 --> 00:56:05,310
Hong Gyeong Rae's "Nan*."
 (Resistance, strife)

686
00:56:05,310 --> 00:56:07,260
They think it's about a nancho*.
(Orchid)

687
00:56:07,260 --> 00:56:10,040
But you give them the workbook, the list of possible questions,

688
00:56:10,040 --> 00:56:14,170
and you make them draw shapes on words. What's the point?

689
00:56:14,870 --> 00:56:19,210
I'll teach them the language first. I'll expand their world and let them imagine.

690
00:56:19,210 --> 00:56:23,500
If I let them understand vocabulary, sentences, text, and implied meanings since 10th grade,

691
00:56:23,500 --> 00:56:25,620
their social status will change, as you said.

692
00:56:25,620 --> 00:56:29,020
So, how many texts can you teach each class that way?

693
00:56:29,020 --> 00:56:30,920
How many? Why does that matter?

694
00:56:30,920 --> 00:56:34,690
It might go slowly at first, but it'd go faster later.

695
00:56:34,690 --> 00:56:38,670
Do you think their parents spend hundreds of thousands on each subject for that?

696
00:56:38,670 --> 00:56:42,400
Wow, I can already hear the parents crying bloody tears.

697
00:56:42,400 --> 00:56:45,000
That's a bargain. That ability will last a lifetime.

698
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:47,680
This is a college entrance exam academy, not an institute of lifelong education.

699
00:56:47,680 --> 00:56:49,910
Excuse me. Hold on.

700
00:56:49,910 --> 00:56:53,470
Both of you should calm down a bit.

701
00:56:53,470 --> 00:56:58,230
I'm glad you said that. You should go out and get some fresh air.

702
00:56:58,230 --> 00:57:01,050
And see how many academies are within the 100-meter radius.

703
00:57:01,050 --> 00:57:04,380
If your method works, the academies won't be needed.

704
00:57:04,380 --> 00:57:07,190
The parents can just read books for them.

705
00:57:07,190 --> 00:57:11,350
That method never was successful, and it never will be!

706
00:57:11,350 --> 00:57:13,990
I'll do it for them since their parents won't.

707
00:57:13,990 --> 00:57:16,420
I need to do this to create the top student in the country.

708
00:57:16,420 --> 00:57:20,110
That's how I succeeded myself and I'll teach the way I succeeded.

709
00:57:20,110 --> 00:57:22,210
Your success? That was ten years ago.

710
00:57:22,210 --> 00:57:23,680
How long will you dwell on that?

711
00:57:23,680 --> 00:57:27,090
I'm not dwelling on it! That's the essence of the subject!

712
00:57:27,090 --> 00:57:30,140
You're the one who's dwelling on it!

713
00:57:30,140 --> 00:57:33,430
You take notes for them in the so-called current Daechi-dong style!

714
00:57:33,430 --> 00:57:36,400
Mr. Lee. Mr. Lee...

715
00:57:36,400 --> 00:57:38,550
That's harsh.

716
00:57:40,930 --> 00:57:43,930
Teachers, go inside. I'll take care of this.

717
00:57:53,830 --> 00:57:55,840
Bring that back.

718
00:57:57,510 --> 00:57:58,750
I don't want to.

719
00:57:58,750 --> 00:58:02,530
Download the file you sent to the printer.

720
00:58:02,530 --> 00:58:04,740
Finish proofreading even if you have to stay up all night.

721
00:58:04,740 --> 00:58:07,270
I won't teach with stuff like that.

722
00:58:07,270 --> 00:58:09,810
I deleted the original copy, too.

723
00:58:13,150 --> 00:58:15,220
I'll kill you if you follow me.

724
00:58:32,600 --> 00:58:34,720
Hold on. Where are you going?

725
00:58:38,120 --> 00:58:40,400
You're too emotional right now.

726
00:58:41,660 --> 00:58:43,600
Because I'm human.

727
00:58:44,500 --> 00:58:47,850
Hye Jin, get it together. Many people are here.

728
00:58:47,850 --> 00:58:50,130
I know.

729
00:58:50,130 --> 00:58:52,050
Let me be alone.

730
00:58:53,640 --> 00:58:56,590
- You don't find me helpful? 
- I'm sorry.

731
00:59:28,100 --> 00:59:31,140
♫  I can remember  ♫

732
00:59:31,140 --> 00:59:37,540
♫   when I was a child  ♫

733

01:00:08,990 --> 01:00:15,220

♫  I'll never know  ♫

750
01:01:45,260 --> 01:01:48,000
 You're the one who's dwelling on it! 

751
01:01:48,000 --> 01:01:52,290
 You take notes for them in the so-called current Daechi-dong style! 

752
01:02:05,180 --> 01:02:08,020
♫  I can remember   ♫

756
01:02:26,540 --> 01:02:29,380
 The call is not going through. You'll be connected to... 

757
01:02:32,320 --> 01:02:34,470
Team Leader Seo isn't answering, right?

758
01:02:35,440 --> 01:02:36,910
No.

759
01:02:38,250 --> 01:02:40,050
She said she wanted to be alone.

760
01:02:43,610 --> 01:02:46,400
She said no one can help her. I'm going.

761
01:02:46,400 --> 01:02:52,000
♫  And since they've always been  ♫

762
01:02:53,520 --> 01:02:57,880

763
01:03:22,220 --> 01:03:24,200
Welcome.

764
01:03:30,930 --> 01:03:32,690
Hello.

765
01:03:33,570 --> 01:03:35,810
Sit anywhere you'd like.

766
01:03:43,080 --> 01:03:45,040
- Hello.
 - Hello.

767
01:03:45,040 --> 01:03:47,190
Looks like it's your first time here.

768
01:03:47,190 --> 01:03:50,260
Yes. Someone told me about it.

769
01:03:51,230 --> 01:03:53,150
You're a teacher, right?

770
01:03:55,610 --> 01:03:56,880
I'll order when my company arrives.

771
01:03:56,880 --> 01:03:59,400
Okay, then.

772
01:04:40,960 --> 01:04:44,840
How will he search the entire Daechi-dong?

773
01:04:44,840 --> 01:04:48,570
She might've gone to meet Attorney Cha. Stop by Night Flight.

774
01:04:48,570 --> 01:04:51,980
If she's not there, just wait at home.

775
01:04:52,680 --> 01:04:54,870
I wish I could look for her with you,

776
01:04:54,870 --> 01:04:57,950
but I want to finish proofreading tonight.

777
01:04:57,950 --> 01:05:00,840
It's okay. You can get back to it.

778
01:05:00,840 --> 01:05:04,570
Text me if you find her.

779
01:05:06,550 --> 01:05:08,900
I'm very worried.

780
01:05:14,920 --> 01:05:17,700
I'm sorry. I...

781
01:05:19,110 --> 01:05:21,630
I was very shocked, to be honest.

782
01:05:30,710 --> 01:05:33,050
Ten years' worth of files would be...

783
01:05:35,040 --> 01:05:37,000
Outrageous.

784
01:05:42,390 --> 01:05:44,920
I felt tempted.

785
01:05:44,920 --> 01:05:46,940
Since I'm human, too...

786
01:05:48,460 --> 01:05:52,990
I imagined myself making a fortune instantly.

787
01:05:54,100 --> 01:05:59,500
Why are you telling me this instead of looking at it?

788
01:05:59,500 --> 01:06:01,170
I know.

789
01:06:05,820 --> 01:06:08,540
You know a student named Seong Ha Yul, right?

790
01:06:08,540 --> 01:06:13,550
Yes, I went to school because she cried.

791
01:06:27,290 --> 01:06:28,890
 Chanyeong High 10th grade, Seong Ha Yul 

792
01:06:33,640 --> 01:06:37,280
 I'll try reading one book per semester! 

793
01:06:37,280 --> 01:06:39,710
During the after-school class,

794
01:06:39,710 --> 01:06:44,370
I suggested they read a book per semester.

795
01:06:46,370 --> 01:06:49,140
I was sure no one would.

796
01:06:50,550 --> 01:06:52,150
But...

797
01:06:53,050 --> 01:06:55,560
she's been keeping that the entire semester.

798
01:06:57,220 --> 01:06:59,550
I felt so embarrassed.

799
01:07:02,110 --> 01:07:06,030
I faced humiliation since I obsessed over an archaic question.

800
01:07:06,030 --> 01:07:09,310
But I was embarrassed about speaking of the principles of education.

801
01:07:10,080 --> 01:07:13,960
And I was also embarrassed that a student was listening to me.

802
01:07:14,620 --> 01:07:19,490
Most of all, I was embarrassed that

803
01:07:20,540 --> 01:07:24,960
I forgot about the students after acting superior.

804
01:07:30,490 --> 01:07:34,590
I can't become any more shameful than this as a teacher, right?

805
01:07:36,450 --> 01:07:38,500
Thank you.

806
01:07:47,010 --> 01:07:49,660
I'll try teaching well...

807
01:07:50,960 --> 01:07:53,380
without your files.

808
01:07:54,180 --> 01:07:56,860
I'll study hard.

809
01:07:56,860 --> 01:07:59,510
As long as students choose me,

810
01:07:59,510 --> 01:08:02,140
I'll give everything I have...

811
01:08:03,380 --> 01:08:05,760
and teach them properly.

812
01:08:06,420 --> 01:08:08,150
In my own way.

813
01:08:08,150 --> 01:08:10,170
 That's how I succeeded myself 

814
01:08:10,170 --> 01:08:13,440
 and I'll teach the way I succeeded. 

815
01:08:20,350 --> 01:08:22,500
Mr. Pyo.

816
01:08:22,500 --> 01:08:24,040
Yes.

817
01:08:24,040 --> 01:08:26,860
May I ask you a favor?

818
01:08:26,860 --> 01:08:28,630
Go ahead.

819
01:08:28,630 --> 01:08:34,140
I'd like you to meet Assistant Director Wu and look at my files.

820
01:08:34,140 --> 01:08:35,570
I'm not asking you to use them.

821
01:08:35,570 --> 01:08:40,190
I'd be very grateful if you didn't.

822
01:08:42,240 --> 01:08:43,580
But?

823
01:08:43,580 --> 01:08:47,020
But as long as you work for Choeseon Korean,

824
01:08:47,020 --> 01:08:52,300
you need to make sure no one can walk all over you.

825
01:08:52,300 --> 01:08:58,440
To do that, maybe you shouldn't disobey Director Choi for a while.

826
01:08:59,350 --> 01:09:02,500
I'll do what I'm supposed to do.

827
01:09:03,770 --> 01:09:08,130
I'll do what I'm supposed to as well.

828
01:09:25,230 --> 01:09:27,940
That's Mr. Lee Jun Ho, right?

829
01:09:29,670 --> 01:09:31,540
It is.

830
01:09:32,720 --> 01:09:35,090
By chance, were you supposed to meet—

831
01:09:35,090 --> 01:09:38,690
No, no. We weren't.

 The Midnight Romance in Hagwon 

839
01:10:53,100 --> 01:10:55,150
 I need to fight with everything I have at stake. 

840
01:10:55,150 --> 01:10:56,670
 I think you might fail. 

841
01:10:56,670 --> 01:10:59,310
 - Are you crazy?
 - No, I'm totally fine. 

842
01:10:59,310 --> 01:11:01,710
 Did Team Leader Seo approve it, too? 

843
01:11:01,710 --> 01:11:04,360
 We'll try seeing each other more, right? 

844

 Let's. 

845
01:11:05,700 --> 01:11:08,400
 Don't think of her as competition. 

846
01:11:08,400 --> 01:11:11,560
 Try to use her for your improvement. 

847
01:11:11,560 --> 01:11:13,120
 No need to beat around the bush. 

848
01:11:13,120 --> 01:11:16,390
 I should quit the academy with the assistant director. 

849
01:11:16,390 --> 01:11:19,090
 Why did my girlfriend have to be a teacher?
