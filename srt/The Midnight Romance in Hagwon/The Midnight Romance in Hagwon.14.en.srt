6
00:01:03,759 --> 00:01:05,529
I said I'd give you gold and riches.

7
00:01:08,270 --> 00:01:10,600
I said we'd live happily forever and ever.

8
00:01:11,509 --> 00:01:13,009
Don't feel bad for me.

9
00:01:15,080 --> 00:01:16,179
Don't be intimidated.

10
00:01:16,979 --> 00:01:19,750
I don't care about riches or a happy forever.

11
00:01:22,819 --> 00:01:23,850
But...

12
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:26,520
There's something I need you to do.

13
00:01:33,530 --> 00:01:34,600
Anything.

14
00:01:35,559 --> 00:01:36,860
With all your heart...

15
00:01:38,330 --> 00:01:39,630
and efforts,

16
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:43,640
love me.

17
00:01:49,179 --> 00:01:50,910
Try to be with me always.

18
00:01:53,479 --> 00:01:55,020
Try to touch and feel me,

19
00:01:55,080 --> 00:01:56,619
and say you want to feed me.

20
00:02:02,319 --> 00:02:03,360
That will do.

21
00:02:43,630 --> 00:02:46,530
(Episode 14)

22
00:03:37,549 --> 00:03:38,690
That will do.

23
00:04:44,890 --> 00:04:46,090
Jun Ho has a girlfriend.

24
00:04:49,559 --> 00:04:51,689
It's his old academy instructor.

25
00:04:55,100 --> 00:04:56,429
Tell me more.

26
00:04:57,229 --> 00:04:59,770
He went to many academies and had many instructors.

27
00:05:00,530 --> 00:05:02,238
His Korean instructor...

28
00:05:02,239 --> 00:05:04,299
from when his grades suddenly shot up.

29
00:05:07,039 --> 00:05:08,410
The one who taught Eun Ho too?

30
00:05:11,150 --> 00:05:12,679
I'm so upset, but...

31
00:05:13,580 --> 00:05:14,879
Why are you upset?

32
00:05:17,549 --> 00:05:18,650
I don't know why.

33
00:05:19,650 --> 00:05:23,220
I want to disapprove, but I can't think of a reason.

34
00:05:25,129 --> 00:05:28,160
Should I complain about her age first?

35
00:05:34,799 --> 00:05:37,770
Call Jun Ho over and talk to him.

36
00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:40,970
You want me to fish for details about my grown son's girlfriend?

37
00:05:41,379 --> 00:05:44,808
I didn't say anything when I first realized...

38
00:05:44,809 --> 00:05:46,210
he was seeing someone.

39
00:05:46,710 --> 00:05:48,450
But now that I know who it is,

40
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:50,478
I have a bad feeling.

41
00:05:50,479 --> 00:05:51,590
What feeling?

42
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:54,090
I think it will last a while.

43
00:05:59,390 --> 00:06:00,890
Let's wait and see.

44
00:06:01,530 --> 00:06:03,329
If we disapprove when they're fired up,

45
00:06:03,330 --> 00:06:05,299
it might even bring them closer.

46
00:06:08,439 --> 00:06:10,669
Did you go and do something already?

47
00:06:11,239 --> 00:06:14,510
Well, I got a bit physical and violent.

48
00:06:14,780 --> 00:06:15,809
With her?

49
00:06:15,939 --> 00:06:17,640
Are you crazy?

50
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:24,520
I'm so sorry. I must've been exhausted.

51
00:06:25,189 --> 00:06:26,189
I just got up.

52
00:06:27,249 --> 00:06:28,460
I didn't wake you on purpose.

53
00:06:29,189 --> 00:06:30,989
I'll take the subway. Don't worry.

54
00:06:32,760 --> 00:06:33,859
See you later.

55
00:06:58,749 --> 00:07:00,689
(Daechi Chase)

56
00:07:03,789 --> 00:07:04,859
Hello.

57
00:07:05,260 --> 00:07:06,260
Hello.

58
00:07:09,059 --> 00:07:10,200
Hello.

59
00:07:10,799 --> 00:07:12,030
(Daechi Chase)

60
00:07:14,570 --> 00:07:15,570
Good morning.

61
00:07:17,039 --> 00:07:18,369
As if it is.

62
00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:21,840
- Hello. - Hello.

63
00:07:23,979 --> 00:07:25,010
Hello.

64
00:07:42,700 --> 00:07:44,059
Min Hui Ju's not coming?

65
00:07:45,129 --> 00:07:46,200
She's on her way.

66
00:07:51,169 --> 00:07:54,410
Shall we get started first?

67
00:07:55,479 --> 00:07:56,910
I hate this.

68
00:08:07,350 --> 00:08:08,390
So,

69
00:08:09,220 --> 00:08:11,160
it's as I said in the message yesterday.

70
00:08:11,760 --> 00:08:13,189
What I object to is the fact...

71
00:08:13,590 --> 00:08:15,260
that someone was prioritized...

72
00:08:15,999 --> 00:08:18,299
in the use of our academy's main resources.

73
00:08:31,239 --> 00:08:32,280
I want in.

74
00:08:37,050 --> 00:08:39,550
Hey, Mom. Did Byeol get a shot?

75
00:08:40,889 --> 00:08:42,759
It's a long wait to see the pediatrician, isn't it?

76
00:08:43,790 --> 00:08:47,330
No, I don't have a new schedule. I just have a meeting.

77
00:08:48,759 --> 00:08:51,060
No, take her to your place, not mine.

78
00:08:51,729 --> 00:08:52,970
Our place is a mess.

79
00:08:53,830 --> 00:08:54,899
Yes.

80
00:08:59,970 --> 00:09:01,479
Come here.

81
00:09:20,889 --> 00:09:22,700
Go somewhere and kill some time.

82
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:25,800
I'll tell you what the others said.

83
00:09:26,869 --> 00:09:27,970
I'll clarify.

84
00:09:30,769 --> 00:09:31,769
"Clarify?"

85
00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:33,869
You'll explain?

86
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:39,279
That won't solve the issue is why.

87
00:09:40,409 --> 00:09:41,978
They're all well-educated,

88
00:09:41,979 --> 00:09:43,420
and they all teach.

89
00:09:44,550 --> 00:09:46,648
If I explain rationally...

90
00:09:46,649 --> 00:09:48,090
Come on.

91
00:09:48,659 --> 00:09:51,690
Jun Ho. Mr. Lee.

92
00:09:53,330 --> 00:09:56,099
They're well-educated, and they teach.

93
00:09:56,100 --> 00:09:58,029
And that's why it's a problem.

94
00:10:00,729 --> 00:10:01,840
What do you mean?

95
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:05,639
They're all rational,

96
00:10:05,769 --> 00:10:07,269
and that's why things will snowball.

97
00:10:08,310 --> 00:10:10,878
You have no idea how many people...

98
00:10:10,879 --> 00:10:13,009
inside and out want Hye Jin to go down.

99
00:10:21,489 --> 00:10:24,220
Mr. Lee. You're stubborn.

100
00:10:29,430 --> 00:10:30,800
Shall I tell you a scary story?

101
00:10:33,529 --> 00:10:34,899
It's about another neighborhood.

102
00:10:35,340 --> 00:10:38,238
An instructor who taught the most students from a school...

103
00:10:38,239 --> 00:10:39,310
got cancer.

104
00:10:40,170 --> 00:10:42,179
It was in the early stages and easy to handle.

105
00:10:42,180 --> 00:10:43,180
But...

106
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:45,180
in less than 24 hours,

107
00:10:45,649 --> 00:10:48,849
a rumor spread that the teacher was terminal...

108
00:10:48,850 --> 00:10:50,149
and didn't have long to live.

109
00:10:51,590 --> 00:10:55,460
That's the rumor others started so they could steal the students.

110
00:10:57,920 --> 00:10:59,359
That's the world we live in.

111
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:06,800
You and Hye Jin.

112
00:11:08,139 --> 00:11:09,170
I don't think...

113
00:11:09,970 --> 00:11:12,909
you would have done something terrible.

114
00:11:16,310 --> 00:11:17,379
So...

115
00:11:18,450 --> 00:11:20,479
go somewhere and have a coffee...

116
00:11:21,350 --> 00:11:22,379
and wait.

117
00:11:23,279 --> 00:11:24,279
Okay?

118
00:11:26,649 --> 00:11:28,460
I asked who called Ms. Seo.

119
00:11:29,220 --> 00:11:31,059
Please hear me out. I'll keep it short.

120
00:11:31,060 --> 00:11:32,190
Who told her about this?

121
00:11:32,729 --> 00:11:33,759
I did.

122
00:11:34,290 --> 00:11:35,359
What?

123
00:11:36,659 --> 00:11:37,759
Will you excuse us?

124
00:11:38,499 --> 00:11:39,600
Can't we...

125
00:11:40,129 --> 00:11:43,170
hear what she has to say?

126
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:48,839
That will make it harder to make an objective decision.

127
00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:51,608
I don't know if this is an issue that needs explaining.

128
00:11:51,609 --> 00:11:52,778
Wait.

129
00:11:52,779 --> 00:11:55,550
This isn't just about a couple dating.

130
00:11:56,749 --> 00:11:58,690
A team leader at an academy,

131
00:11:59,950 --> 00:12:01,859
a main instructor of all people...

132
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:03,858
used her authority...

133
00:12:03,859 --> 00:12:05,889
and showered a new recruit with privileges...

134
00:12:06,060 --> 00:12:08,200
and benefits and that's what I object to.

135
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:10,359
The ad was weird.

136
00:12:11,670 --> 00:12:13,930
"A teacher and student sally forth." So old-fashioned.

137
00:12:14,269 --> 00:12:15,769
I'll start with that ad.

138
00:12:16,769 --> 00:12:19,739
- Heewon High was always... - Shouldn't you...

139
00:12:20,310 --> 00:12:23,239
start by saying whether or not you are dating?

140
00:12:23,479 --> 00:12:24,479
Gosh.

141
00:12:27,450 --> 00:12:28,879
Mr. Lee is...

142
00:12:32,190 --> 00:12:33,249
He is...

143
00:12:43,700 --> 00:12:44,999
What's this?

144
00:12:45,529 --> 00:12:47,700
Are you moving as a team now?

145
00:12:52,170 --> 00:12:53,210
Or did you...

146
00:12:54,269 --> 00:12:56,639
decide to host a tearful press conference?

147
00:12:57,580 --> 00:12:58,609
It's not that.

148
00:12:59,180 --> 00:13:00,608
I didn't know Ms. Seo was here, and...

149
00:13:00,609 --> 00:13:02,248
As if you don't know.

150
00:13:02,249 --> 00:13:03,850
You practically live together.

151
00:13:20,700 --> 00:13:21,769
Mr. Lee Myeong Jun.

152
00:13:23,869 --> 00:13:25,469
Yes? What?

153
00:13:25,470 --> 00:13:27,369
Can I speak as equals, man to man?

154
00:13:29,279 --> 00:13:30,279
What?

155
00:13:38,119 --> 00:13:39,519
(Problems With Colonial Modernization Theory)

156
00:13:41,249 --> 00:13:43,190
Son. Mom's going out.

157
00:13:43,989 --> 00:13:45,290
- Already? - Yes, I'm busy.

158
00:13:53,399 --> 00:13:55,499
Is it about the text you got yesterday?

159
00:13:57,869 --> 00:13:59,638
What's the big deal...

160
00:13:59,639 --> 00:14:01,639
about two instructors seeing each other?

161
00:14:02,580 --> 00:14:05,310
Weren't you the one who vouched for Jun Ho's class?

162
00:14:06,009 --> 00:14:07,509
You don't know what you're talking about.

163
00:14:08,050 --> 00:14:09,149
What don't I know?

164
00:14:09,649 --> 00:14:10,680
How a parent feels.

165
00:14:11,519 --> 00:14:12,519
What does that mean?

166
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:17,319
These days, to send one kid to a decent university,

167
00:14:17,320 --> 00:14:20,060
both parents and even the grandparents...

168
00:14:20,229 --> 00:14:23,159
put in money, effort, and trust into instructors.

169
00:14:23,359 --> 00:14:25,470
And to think they get up to no good at work?

170
00:14:25,729 --> 00:14:27,430
I can't let someone like that teach my kid.

171
00:14:27,629 --> 00:14:28,840
What do you mean by "no good?"

172
00:14:29,399 --> 00:14:32,138
What kind of talk has been going around during the night?

173
00:14:32,139 --> 00:14:33,909
That's how things will turn out soon.

174
00:14:35,080 --> 00:14:36,180
Goodness.

175
00:14:38,609 --> 00:14:39,649
It has begun.

176
00:14:42,450 --> 00:14:44,249
Hello, you're A Jeong's mom, right?

177
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:46,519
Yes.

178
00:14:46,649 --> 00:14:48,320
It's pretty early for a call.

179
00:14:48,859 --> 00:14:51,220
What? No, it's fine.

180
00:15:09,909 --> 00:15:12,810
Hey. I think the rumor about you got weird.

181
00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:24,720
Are you okay?

182
00:15:34,070 --> 00:15:35,839
You two got up to no good,

183
00:15:35,840 --> 00:15:37,469
and you're saying what now?

184
00:15:37,470 --> 00:15:39,738
I said I felt sorry for the kids you teach!

185
00:15:39,739 --> 00:15:41,709
- What? How dare you? - Stop it!

186
00:15:41,710 --> 00:15:44,009
- You, come here. - You think I can't?

187
00:15:44,139 --> 00:15:47,210
Who gave you the right to call me names?

188
00:15:47,310 --> 00:15:49,279
Did you hear what he said?

189
00:15:49,450 --> 00:15:51,790
The kids will start coming in soon. Will you stop it?

190
00:15:52,019 --> 00:15:53,519
Let go! I'm calming down.

191
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:55,960
My gosh. Who does he think he is?

192
00:15:56,119 --> 00:15:57,189
- Mr. Yoon. - Darn it.

193
00:15:57,190 --> 00:15:58,758
- That's enough. - Did you see that?

194
00:15:58,759 --> 00:16:00,858
- This isn't right, is it? - Are you defending him?

195
00:16:00,859 --> 00:16:02,358
- He came after me. - What?

196
00:16:02,359 --> 00:16:03,429
- Please. - Let me go.

197
00:16:03,430 --> 00:16:06,299
- Come here! - We need to talk calmly.

198
00:16:06,300 --> 00:16:07,700
What good is that?

199
00:16:08,229 --> 00:16:09,768
Jun Ho's reaction explained it all.

200
00:16:09,769 --> 00:16:11,369
- Mr. Yoon. - This blows.

201
00:16:11,869 --> 00:16:13,508
I don't believe this.

202
00:16:13,509 --> 00:16:14,509
Ms. Seo.

203
00:16:15,379 --> 00:16:17,509
I don't think you have time for this.

204
00:16:22,249 --> 00:16:23,320
Okay, thanks.

205
00:16:28,790 --> 00:16:29,790
Why give me this?

206
00:16:30,019 --> 00:16:31,290
You have nicer handwriting.

207
00:16:31,489 --> 00:16:33,290
I haven't written anything in years.

208
00:16:33,790 --> 00:16:34,790
What should I write?

209
00:16:35,529 --> 00:16:38,499
"Thank you so much for the good results in the finals."

210
00:16:38,700 --> 00:16:40,200
"Help us out in the coming year too."

211
00:16:40,769 --> 00:16:43,170
Isn't that something I should say to the teachers?

212
00:16:43,700 --> 00:16:45,969
We pay your instructors every month.

213
00:16:45,970 --> 00:16:47,570
Do you know how much that is?

214
00:16:48,680 --> 00:16:49,878
Go to your academy after this.

215
00:16:49,879 --> 00:16:50,979
After a short prayer.

216
00:16:58,080 --> 00:16:59,590
- Sung Ha Yul. - What?

217
00:17:00,249 --> 00:17:02,690
Give me Seo Hye Jin's printouts and homework.

218
00:17:03,519 --> 00:17:05,019
Here? Right now?

219
00:17:05,119 --> 00:17:06,129
Do as I say.

220
00:17:19,939 --> 00:17:20,968
(Full-mark Korean)

221
00:17:20,969 --> 00:17:22,010
Here.

222
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:24,310
Where's the rest?

223
00:17:24,939 --> 00:17:26,310
There were no printouts,

224
00:17:26,679 --> 00:17:28,850
and the homework was to read the next chapter.

225
00:17:29,619 --> 00:17:31,250
- Is that all? - Yes.

226
00:17:31,449 --> 00:17:33,350
She suggested we change how we study.

227
00:17:36,119 --> 00:17:37,119
She must be crazy.

228
00:17:54,909 --> 00:17:56,480
Hello, Shin Dae Baek speaking.

229
00:18:00,280 --> 00:18:02,280
Yes. Why are you calling me?

230
00:18:05,790 --> 00:18:08,490
Yes, I do work at Daechi Chase.

231
00:18:11,619 --> 00:18:12,629
Yes.

232
00:18:21,969 --> 00:18:25,810
I don't see how this is something you'd call me about.

233
00:18:29,580 --> 00:18:31,439
You said you'd explain rationally.

234
00:18:31,909 --> 00:18:33,480
What have you done?

235
00:18:36,350 --> 00:18:37,350
Drink this.

236
00:18:41,419 --> 00:18:42,459
Thank you.

237
00:18:44,760 --> 00:18:47,389
Drink that and get a strong hold of yourself.

238
00:18:52,230 --> 00:18:54,469
What happened here might be nothing at all.

239
00:18:55,199 --> 00:18:56,199
Outside...

240
00:18:58,100 --> 00:18:59,540
I think it's much worse.

241
00:19:00,469 --> 00:19:03,878
Jung Soo takes pretty good notes compared to most kids,

242
00:19:03,879 --> 00:19:05,579
and he concentrates in class.

243
00:19:05,580 --> 00:19:06,649
Yes.

244
00:19:06,750 --> 00:19:08,919
But his books show no signs that he studied.

245
00:19:09,050 --> 00:19:10,619
That goes for Ye Eun too.

246
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:12,590
Don't you think something's off?

247
00:19:13,050 --> 00:19:14,618
She used to give out loads of homework,

248
00:19:14,619 --> 00:19:16,289
packs of printouts,

249
00:19:16,290 --> 00:19:18,260
and mock exams for the kids to go through.

250
00:19:18,629 --> 00:19:20,458
She said she'd stop checking their homework.

251
00:19:20,459 --> 00:19:23,599
Doesn't that mean she gave up monitoring the kids altogether?

252
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:26,168
She doesn't even grade the homework herself.

253
00:19:26,169 --> 00:19:27,369
Her TA does.

254
00:19:27,399 --> 00:19:29,299
- Gosh. - Goodness.

255
00:19:29,300 --> 00:19:31,639
Oh, forget it.

256
00:19:33,169 --> 00:19:34,939
Is she short on energy?

257
00:19:36,280 --> 00:19:37,280
Because he's younger?

258
00:19:38,879 --> 00:19:40,409
Watch what you say.

259
00:19:40,909 --> 00:19:41,949
Excuse me.

260
00:19:42,419 --> 00:19:44,020
You mean Seo Hye Jin, right?

261
00:19:44,850 --> 00:19:45,850
Yes.

262
00:19:47,649 --> 00:19:49,219
Could we join you?

263
00:19:49,790 --> 00:19:51,359
Yes, I guess?

264
00:19:54,659 --> 00:19:55,699
(Full-mark Korean)

265
00:20:04,199 --> 00:20:06,139
- Is your kid in tenth grade? - Yes.

266
00:20:07,169 --> 00:20:08,169
So is mine.

267
00:20:10,879 --> 00:20:13,409
This is no laughing matter.

268
00:20:15,780 --> 00:20:17,719
That instructor whom she taught.

269
00:20:18,050 --> 00:20:19,719
- Lee Jun Ho? - Yes.

270
00:20:20,790 --> 00:20:22,520
He used to work at Jungwon Group.

271
00:20:23,219 --> 00:20:24,520
What about it?

272
00:20:25,689 --> 00:20:27,759
To make a man leave a perfectly fine job...

273
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:29,429
to teach at an academy.

274
00:20:29,929 --> 00:20:31,859
Do you think that was an easy feat?

275
00:20:33,199 --> 00:20:34,270
What?

276
00:20:35,469 --> 00:20:37,499
When Seo Hye Jin first came here,

277
00:20:37,500 --> 00:20:39,669
Lee Jun Ho was her only student.

278
00:20:41,439 --> 00:20:44,510
Perhaps back in the day, Seo Hye Jin gave him...

279
00:20:47,449 --> 00:20:49,820
an experience he could never forget.

280
00:20:51,919 --> 00:20:53,489
- No. - No.

281
00:20:53,490 --> 00:20:55,490
- You went too far. - Yes.

282
00:20:56,889 --> 00:20:58,520
Do you have a daughter?

283
00:20:59,359 --> 00:21:00,359
Yes.

284
00:21:00,629 --> 00:21:02,129
I have a son, so I know.

285
00:21:02,659 --> 00:21:04,260
Teenage boys.

286
00:21:05,469 --> 00:21:07,800
They're so virile and full of energy.

287
00:21:09,240 --> 00:21:12,369
- Oh, gosh. No way. - If that's really true...

288
00:21:12,609 --> 00:21:14,668
- That's disgusting. - Hi.

289
00:21:14,669 --> 00:21:16,479
What's disgusting?

290
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:18,540
Something crazy is going on. Sit down.

291
00:21:18,879 --> 00:21:20,709
- Gosh... - Oh, no...

292
00:21:21,149 --> 00:21:23,019
(Choisun will become the best.)

293
00:21:23,020 --> 00:21:25,219
That's how crazy they were.

294
00:21:26,050 --> 00:21:28,618
They stayed behind alone in classrooms.

295
00:21:28,619 --> 00:21:31,020
- Oh, gosh. - In a classroom?

296
00:21:32,590 --> 00:21:33,958
- Hello. - Hello.

297
00:21:33,959 --> 00:21:34,990
Director.

298
00:21:35,959 --> 00:21:36,959
It's incredible.

299
00:21:38,330 --> 00:21:40,629
As soon as you hired Pyo Sang Seob,

300
00:21:40,730 --> 00:21:42,869
Daechi Chase seemed to implode.

301
00:21:43,699 --> 00:21:46,169
This must be your lucky year.

302
00:21:46,770 --> 00:21:48,439
What are you talking about?

303
00:21:48,540 --> 00:21:49,908
You know Seo Hye Jin, right?

304
00:21:49,909 --> 00:21:52,009
The one who taught with her ex-student.

305
00:21:52,010 --> 00:21:54,080
I know who that is. What about her?

306
00:21:56,679 --> 00:21:58,379
That ex-student instructor...

307
00:21:59,719 --> 00:22:00,820
was her lover.

308
00:22:01,550 --> 00:22:02,619
Since he was in school.

309
00:22:03,889 --> 00:22:04,889
Really?

310
00:22:05,459 --> 00:22:07,590
I don't think this will go away quietly.

311
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,899
Oh, dear. What a shame.

312
00:22:12,500 --> 00:22:13,969
She's a good teacher.

313
00:22:15,469 --> 00:22:17,500
(Choisun Academy)

314
00:22:32,790 --> 00:22:34,020
Seo Hye Jin.

315
00:22:36,159 --> 00:22:37,389
What a waste.

316
00:22:41,889 --> 00:22:42,929
Come in.

317
00:22:46,600 --> 00:22:49,500
You came right on time.

318
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:51,040
Director Choi.

319
00:22:51,169 --> 00:22:54,270
You prosper each day, and I'm pleased for you.

320
00:22:54,740 --> 00:22:55,740
Thank you.

321
00:22:56,040 --> 00:22:57,379
- Take a seat. - Okay.

322
00:23:00,679 --> 00:23:02,949
I'd recommend this property...

323
00:23:03,949 --> 00:23:05,550
and this one.

324
00:23:05,820 --> 00:23:08,618
They both used to be academies,

325
00:23:08,619 --> 00:23:11,619
so you'll save money on setting things up.

326
00:23:12,090 --> 00:23:13,629
And it's close to this place too.

327
00:23:15,159 --> 00:23:17,099
The owner of this property...

328
00:23:17,100 --> 00:23:19,399
just turned 30 years old.

329
00:23:19,500 --> 00:23:22,129
He spends half the year traveling the world.

330
00:23:22,500 --> 00:23:24,438
He put my office in charge of management.

331
00:23:24,439 --> 00:23:25,969
That would benefit you too.

332
00:23:27,869 --> 00:23:30,179
Shall I arrange a formal meeting?

333
00:23:30,280 --> 00:23:31,340
No.

334
00:23:33,449 --> 00:23:35,980
There's a building I have in mind.

335
00:23:36,050 --> 00:23:39,189
Oh, okay. Tell me which one it is.

336
00:23:39,550 --> 00:23:43,020
Do you know Daechi Chase that's on the main road?

337
00:23:43,290 --> 00:23:44,359
I do.

338
00:23:45,189 --> 00:23:47,659
I don't think there are any empty floors in that building.

339
00:23:48,629 --> 00:23:50,600
I have a feeling there will be a few soon.

340
00:23:52,869 --> 00:23:55,639
I want to move into the floor...

341
00:23:55,899 --> 00:23:57,399
they have the classrooms on.

342
00:23:58,669 --> 00:23:59,810
I'll look into it.

343
00:24:01,939 --> 00:24:03,040
Thank you.

344
00:24:20,590 --> 00:24:21,760
What's going on?

345
00:24:24,330 --> 00:24:25,929
Check your online messenger.

346
00:24:27,100 --> 00:24:29,839
Won't everyone associated with Ms. Seo go down?

347
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:32,270
Do you think she'll go down just like that?

348
00:24:46,619 --> 00:24:47,619
Let's go outside.

349
00:24:48,990 --> 00:24:49,990
I'm fine.

350
00:24:51,820 --> 00:24:54,389
Don't sit here and let everyone stare.

351
00:24:54,530 --> 00:24:55,730
We did nothing wrong.

352
00:24:56,530 --> 00:24:57,730
There's no reason to run away.

353
00:25:05,300 --> 00:25:06,369
Hey.

354
00:25:07,969 --> 00:25:10,480
Why are the director and vice-director so quiet?

355
00:25:12,780 --> 00:25:13,780
I don't know.

356
00:25:21,889 --> 00:25:24,790
Why did you come this far this early in the day?

357
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:34,469
Is there something we can't discuss at work?

358
00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:40,409
I rushed over wondering if I should go on my knees.

359
00:25:41,540 --> 00:25:43,480
Gosh. That's a bit much.

360
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:51,480
Goodness.

361
00:25:54,389 --> 00:25:57,859
I got about 500 calls this morning.

362
00:25:58,619 --> 00:26:01,358
I think I'll get about 5,000 more.

363
00:26:01,359 --> 00:26:03,198
Then you should go and sort it out...

364
00:26:03,199 --> 00:26:04,760
instead of coming here.

365
00:26:06,300 --> 00:26:09,240
Beating around the bush will only be a waste of time.

366
00:26:09,840 --> 00:26:11,240
I'll ask you point blank.

367
00:26:13,040 --> 00:26:15,209
Why on earth as you doing this?

368
00:26:16,679 --> 00:26:17,709
Why?

369
00:26:18,609 --> 00:26:20,709
I'm just trying to take my share.

370
00:26:21,010 --> 00:26:24,550
We got along well so far.

371
00:26:24,820 --> 00:26:26,750
Who got along well? Us?

372
00:26:29,320 --> 00:26:32,429
Well, there were times when we butted heads...

373
00:26:32,959 --> 00:26:34,989
on how to run the academy...

374
00:26:34,990 --> 00:26:36,459
and how to manage our staff,

375
00:26:36,959 --> 00:26:38,658
but we were pretty democratic...

376
00:26:38,659 --> 00:26:40,629
I have too long to live.

377
00:26:41,330 --> 00:26:43,539
Way too long to spend it working for...

378
00:26:43,540 --> 00:26:45,500
democratic Kim Hyun Tak for a fixed salary.

379
00:26:46,469 --> 00:26:49,208
If I'm unlucky, I might have to live longer...

380
00:26:49,209 --> 00:26:51,080
than I already have.

381
00:26:52,879 --> 00:26:56,350
Today is the youngest I'll ever be,

382
00:26:56,649 --> 00:26:59,189
and I want to get fired up and bloom.

383
00:27:00,590 --> 00:27:01,619
That fire.

384
00:27:02,619 --> 00:27:04,659
Couldn't we set it together?

385
00:27:09,429 --> 00:27:11,530
If you tell me what you want...

386
00:27:16,169 --> 00:27:17,199
If I tell you,

387
00:27:18,139 --> 00:27:19,409
will you give it to me?

388
00:27:22,209 --> 00:27:24,179
Even if I can't give you all you ask,

389
00:27:24,740 --> 00:27:27,709
couldn't we at least discuss and agree...

390
00:27:28,050 --> 00:27:30,079
on something that works for us both?

391
00:27:30,080 --> 00:27:32,249
It's pointless if you can't give me all I ask.

392
00:27:32,250 --> 00:27:35,859
Actually, even if you give me all I ask, it's not enough.

393
00:27:36,090 --> 00:27:39,260
What I want is the academy you took from me.

394
00:27:39,929 --> 00:27:41,230
My goodness.

395
00:27:42,330 --> 00:27:45,330
Don't talk like I stole Victoria Academy.

396
00:27:45,800 --> 00:27:47,769
What we did benefited us both at the time.

397
00:27:47,770 --> 00:27:50,439
I was the easiest prey within your grasp.

398
00:27:51,300 --> 00:27:53,269
It was when I was short on cash...

399
00:27:53,270 --> 00:27:55,040
because I was expanding it.

400
00:27:55,340 --> 00:27:57,510
Okay. At the time,

401
00:27:58,439 --> 00:28:00,349
I'd won over your teachers already,

402
00:28:00,350 --> 00:28:02,280
so I bought you out pretty cheap.

403
00:28:02,520 --> 00:28:05,280
But I made you vice-director, and that compensation...

404
00:28:05,379 --> 00:28:06,419
was more than enough...

405
00:28:10,020 --> 00:28:12,790
You think that was more than enough.

406
00:28:13,359 --> 00:28:15,290
That's why we can't reach an agreement.

407
00:28:17,060 --> 00:28:18,060
Help me out here.

408
00:28:19,429 --> 00:28:21,969
Hye Jin's about to lose all her students.

409
00:28:22,169 --> 00:28:23,769
If the instructors leave too,

410
00:28:23,770 --> 00:28:26,509
I'll have to close down next month.

411
00:28:26,510 --> 00:28:27,908
It wouldn't be...

412
00:28:27,909 --> 00:28:30,310
a bad idea to start over, then.

413
00:28:34,310 --> 00:28:37,050
Today is the youngest you'll ever be.

414
00:28:41,090 --> 00:28:42,689
You can't do this.

415
00:28:46,459 --> 00:28:48,830
I get that you have a lot against me.

416
00:28:49,699 --> 00:28:51,959
But what did Hye Jin do?

417
00:28:52,899 --> 00:28:55,938
She's good enough that she can start over...

418
00:28:55,939 --> 00:28:57,699
- anywhere else. - Ms. Woo.

419
00:28:57,969 --> 00:28:58,969
That's it.

420
00:29:01,040 --> 00:29:03,709
I'll send my resignation by email.

421
00:29:03,879 --> 00:29:06,050
No, wait. Ms. Woo.

422
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:09,480
What...

423
00:29:27,199 --> 00:29:28,199
Help me.

424
00:29:32,040 --> 00:29:33,540
Let me explain.

425
00:29:33,969 --> 00:29:36,340
The instructors need to stay...

426
00:29:40,379 --> 00:29:41,679
Sorry.

427
00:29:42,879 --> 00:29:44,020
I can't believe...

428
00:29:44,649 --> 00:29:46,790
how little influence you have now.

429
00:29:49,959 --> 00:29:52,218
At least let us last another semester...

430
00:29:52,219 --> 00:29:55,330
Why are you going overboard?

431
00:29:55,859 --> 00:29:57,399
It's not like you own this academy.

432
00:29:57,760 --> 00:29:59,300
I wouldn't be asking if it were mine.

433
00:30:00,669 --> 00:30:02,300
What did Director Kim do to deserve this?

434
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:07,369
Ms. Woo said...

435
00:30:08,840 --> 00:30:09,939
I should've listened...

436
00:30:10,409 --> 00:30:12,609
when she suggested we squash some of the power you have.

437
00:30:15,850 --> 00:30:17,080
She was right.

438
00:30:20,119 --> 00:30:21,719
That's who Woo Seung Hui is.

439
00:30:26,060 --> 00:30:29,260
The thoughts one keeps buried deep inside?

440
00:30:29,859 --> 00:30:32,899
She has a knack for sniffing out the musty scent they give off.

441
00:30:33,869 --> 00:30:35,800
Director Kim's anxiety.

442
00:30:35,969 --> 00:30:38,239
Lee Myeong Jun's insecurity. The White Haired Witch's greed.

443
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:40,168
She took advantage of that, and now with you...

444
00:30:40,169 --> 00:30:41,169
No way.

445
00:30:43,280 --> 00:30:45,980
So this is how people change when they're cornered.

446
00:30:46,510 --> 00:30:49,149
- You're badmouthing others. - This isn't me talking smack.

447
00:30:55,290 --> 00:30:56,719
Know your place.

448
00:30:58,689 --> 00:31:01,060
You're the reason the academy imploded, not me.

449
00:31:02,359 --> 00:31:03,800
All because you're head over heels for your young student.

450
00:31:09,300 --> 00:31:10,439
Take the call.

451
00:31:11,240 --> 00:31:14,169
Your time will be better spent explaining yourself to the mothers.

452
00:31:22,879 --> 00:31:23,919
Yes, ma'am.

453
00:31:29,490 --> 00:31:31,189
I understand, ma'am,

454
00:31:31,260 --> 00:31:33,958
but have you discussed this with Do Gyeom?

455
00:31:33,959 --> 00:31:35,760
I'm afraid there's a long wait list...

456
00:31:37,300 --> 00:31:39,060
for Chanyoung High consultations.

457
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:44,300
Leave your contact information, and we'll call.

458
00:31:45,240 --> 00:31:46,240
Sure.

459
00:31:46,340 --> 00:31:49,480
Ma'am, it's not what you think.

460
00:31:49,639 --> 00:31:50,879
Of course not...

461
00:31:51,109 --> 00:31:53,349
A minor, you say?

462
00:31:53,350 --> 00:31:55,409
Ma'am, can you hold?

463
00:31:55,449 --> 00:31:56,979
This is Daechi Chase... Yes.

464
00:31:56,980 --> 00:31:58,878
I see. Just a second.

465
00:31:58,879 --> 00:32:01,750
Ma'am, let me call you back. I'm terribly sorry.

466
00:32:01,949 --> 00:32:03,119
Yes?

467
00:32:03,219 --> 00:32:04,459
I see.

468
00:32:04,719 --> 00:32:06,129
May I have a name?

469
00:32:06,830 --> 00:32:09,459
I'm afraid you can't come in for a consultation today.

470
00:32:11,560 --> 00:32:13,529
Of course it isn't that.

471
00:32:13,530 --> 00:32:15,499
- We'll give you a call. - I'm afraid we're fully booked.

472
00:32:15,500 --> 00:32:17,939
Not just the consultations, but also Ms. Seo...

473
00:32:35,119 --> 00:32:37,020
You will be doused in nasty water.

474
00:32:46,530 --> 00:32:48,500
Why are you out here in the cold?

475
00:32:49,300 --> 00:32:50,340
Right.

476
00:32:51,070 --> 00:32:52,169
I just ended up here.

477
00:32:54,639 --> 00:32:57,939
If you're going to be in agony, be so somewhere warm.

478
00:32:58,580 --> 00:33:00,850
- I looked for you everywhere. - I'm not in agony.

479
00:33:01,449 --> 00:33:02,949
The question I raised was aboveboard.

480
00:33:06,649 --> 00:33:08,189
That's how far you'll go.

481
00:33:12,760 --> 00:33:13,760
What do you mean?

482
00:33:15,490 --> 00:33:17,560
Ms. Seo's in a huge mess with just the rumors...

483
00:33:17,959 --> 00:33:19,668
that have been spreading outside.

484
00:33:19,669 --> 00:33:21,199
I didn't cause any of that.

485
00:33:21,330 --> 00:33:22,840
No matter who did it...

486
00:33:27,609 --> 00:33:28,609
Wait.

487
00:33:30,340 --> 00:33:32,408
That sounds like there was someone else...

488
00:33:32,409 --> 00:33:33,980
in charge of spreading those rumors.

489
00:33:35,409 --> 00:33:37,619
It also sounds like the whole attack was coordinated by a mastermind.

490
00:33:38,719 --> 00:33:39,750
Am I right?

491
00:33:39,990 --> 00:33:41,490
I have a class I must go to.

492
00:33:42,990 --> 00:33:44,789
Could that person be...

493
00:33:44,790 --> 00:33:46,020
I have a class.

494
00:33:50,699 --> 00:33:53,000
Was it Ms. Woo?

495
00:33:54,770 --> 00:33:57,500
And did Lee Myeong Jun spread the rumors?

496
00:34:00,740 --> 00:34:01,810
Darn.

497
00:34:10,080 --> 00:34:13,049
Ms. Woo will soon make an offer.

498
00:34:14,089 --> 00:34:16,389
Seriously consider it. The ship we're on is sinking.

499
00:34:18,089 --> 00:34:21,429
You people are like trash.

500
00:34:23,330 --> 00:34:25,759
What did you just call me?

501
00:34:31,900 --> 00:34:33,170
Let's set the record straight.

502
00:34:34,909 --> 00:34:37,409
She'll be fine if we support her together...

503
00:34:37,679 --> 00:34:39,210
and clear the air regarding the rumor.

504
00:34:39,509 --> 00:34:41,409
- We can take it all back. - For what though?

505
00:34:43,250 --> 00:34:45,779
Think about how much Ms. Seo is hurting.

506
00:34:49,489 --> 00:34:50,489
Mr. Yoon.

507
00:34:52,759 --> 00:34:53,830
You'll most certainly...

508
00:34:55,460 --> 00:34:57,060
regret this.

509
00:34:59,029 --> 00:35:00,069
Sure.

510
00:35:01,069 --> 00:35:02,400
And I'm sorry about that.

511
00:35:09,710 --> 00:35:11,079
The textbooks being clean doesn't mean...

512
00:35:11,080 --> 00:35:12,839
they haven't been studying.

513
00:35:13,750 --> 00:35:15,879
I'm helping students who have trouble with reading...

514
00:35:15,880 --> 00:35:17,350
learn the basics.

515
00:35:18,020 --> 00:35:19,849
We feel like...

516
00:35:19,850 --> 00:35:22,249
you've abruptly changed your style of teaching.

517
00:35:22,250 --> 00:35:23,719
We're worried about progress as well.

518
00:35:24,089 --> 00:35:26,059
It doesn't seem like you'll be able...

519
00:35:26,060 --> 00:35:27,589
to teach all that's on the syllabus.

520
00:35:29,860 --> 00:35:32,659
Jung Soo is a top student when it comes to Korean.

521
00:35:33,270 --> 00:35:35,829
He achieved first class on his finals,

522
00:35:35,830 --> 00:35:37,139
and I was over the moon.

523
00:35:37,600 --> 00:35:38,839
Gosh.

524
00:35:38,940 --> 00:35:40,369
He did well on the KSAT mock exam as well.

525
00:35:41,069 --> 00:35:42,110
I see.

526
00:35:42,940 --> 00:35:45,040
But I don't think Jung Soo...

527
00:35:45,739 --> 00:35:47,980
will be able to maintain his grade in 12th grade.

528
00:35:49,179 --> 00:35:50,480
- Sorry? - My gosh.

529
00:35:51,549 --> 00:35:53,149
Are you hoping he won't do well?

530
00:35:53,150 --> 00:35:54,888
No, this is me reflecting on myself.

531
00:35:54,889 --> 00:35:56,589
My way of teaching will fail him.

532
00:35:57,060 --> 00:35:59,290
Kids will fluster after coming across unfamiliar passages...

533
00:35:59,460 --> 00:36:01,889
and will panic with passages they haven't studied.

534
00:36:02,259 --> 00:36:03,829
Ha Yul, Ye Eun,

535
00:36:03,830 --> 00:36:05,730
Jung Soo, Sang Hui, and U Ju.

536
00:36:05,960 --> 00:36:07,468
With every new school year,

537
00:36:07,469 --> 00:36:10,270
they will gradually grow less confident.

538
00:36:11,569 --> 00:36:12,599
With this new method,

539
00:36:12,600 --> 00:36:15,069
can you guarantee a first class grade?

540
00:36:17,179 --> 00:36:19,138
Parents want me to improve the grade...

541
00:36:19,139 --> 00:36:21,309
of a student who lacks basic knowledge and...

542
00:36:21,310 --> 00:36:23,020
You say you'll do it.

543
00:36:23,279 --> 00:36:24,319
Of course...

544
00:36:26,219 --> 00:36:27,219
I can't guarantee it.

545
00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:28,619
- What? - My gosh.

546
00:36:29,049 --> 00:36:32,059
Are you conducting an experiment with our children, then?

547
00:36:32,060 --> 00:36:34,060
I believe I'm on the right track,

548
00:36:34,389 --> 00:36:37,429
but I'm saying I can't promise you results...

549
00:36:37,630 --> 00:36:39,460
because the students are the ones who study.

550
00:36:40,100 --> 00:36:42,068
Also, to do better than their peers...

551
00:36:42,069 --> 00:36:43,638
who properly learned to read and write from a young age,

552
00:36:43,639 --> 00:36:45,000
they need to change their basic approach.

553
00:36:45,170 --> 00:36:46,539
Are you saying...

554
00:36:46,540 --> 00:36:49,069
that we did a foul job educating our children?

555
00:36:50,909 --> 00:36:52,508
After they graduated elementary school,

556
00:36:52,509 --> 00:36:55,449
you probably canceled their home-study materials.

557
00:36:56,310 --> 00:36:58,019
From that moment on,

558
00:36:58,020 --> 00:37:00,719
parents rarely get a chance to read with their children.

559
00:37:02,850 --> 00:37:04,420
Practicing how to properly read and write.

560
00:37:06,259 --> 00:37:09,230
I'd like to try picking up where you left off.

561
00:37:09,730 --> 00:37:12,199
And I believe their progress will be shown in their grades.

562
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:14,869
Unbelievable.

563
00:37:20,270 --> 00:37:22,409
Us worshiping you as the mighty mentor...

564
00:37:22,770 --> 00:37:24,110
finally went to your head.

565
00:37:25,239 --> 00:37:26,279
Ma'am?

566
00:37:27,409 --> 00:37:29,650
You're too busy doing what's too despicable to mention...

567
00:37:30,580 --> 00:37:33,319
and couldn't care less about teaching our kids,

568
00:37:33,719 --> 00:37:34,949
but you dared to blame that on us.

569
00:37:35,290 --> 00:37:36,420
Gosh, please.

570
00:37:37,119 --> 00:37:38,889
There seems to be a misunderstanding.

571
00:37:40,360 --> 00:37:42,690
You're so talented that you seduced your own student.

572
00:37:43,460 --> 00:37:45,400
You should be ashamed of yourself.

573
00:37:45,630 --> 00:37:48,069
I don't know what you heard about me,

574
00:37:48,969 --> 00:37:50,169
but it isn't true.

575
00:37:50,170 --> 00:37:52,469
Are you telling me you're not dating a student?

576
00:37:55,139 --> 00:37:56,139
Gosh.

577
00:37:56,909 --> 00:37:59,339
- Come on. - Gosh, please.

578
00:38:05,020 --> 00:38:07,719
What would the students learn from a lunatic like you?

579
00:38:09,020 --> 00:38:10,389
I'm asking for a refund.

580
00:38:11,889 --> 00:38:14,230
But... Ha Yul's mom.

581
00:38:14,929 --> 00:38:16,600
- Ha Yul's mom! - Ha Yul's mom.

582
00:39:02,639 --> 00:39:03,839
Just a second.

583
00:39:06,440 --> 00:39:07,509
Yes?

584
00:39:35,170 --> 00:39:36,580
Where's Mr. Lee?

585
00:39:38,509 --> 00:39:41,178
He waited for you but then went to teach his class.

586
00:39:41,179 --> 00:39:43,779
Good for him.

587
00:39:44,949 --> 00:39:46,520
He shouldn't see me like this.

(Letter of Resignation)

591
00:41:38,929 --> 00:41:40,129
It's important to train your mind...

592
00:41:40,130 --> 00:41:42,830
into thinking of an image after reading a passage.

593
00:41:43,469 --> 00:41:45,839
And that doesn't only apply to Korean literature.

594
00:41:46,299 --> 00:41:48,170
Let's go over the essay I handed out.

595
00:41:50,080 --> 00:41:52,908
(Read the passage and answer the following questions.)

596
00:41:52,909 --> 00:41:55,480
"The saying's a cliche, but Chuncheon is a lakeside city."

597
00:41:56,250 --> 00:41:58,719
"However, Chuncheon only had a lake at its heart..."

598
00:41:58,920 --> 00:42:00,850
"for less than 50 years."

599
00:42:00,889 --> 00:42:01,920
Mr. Lee.

600
00:42:04,420 --> 00:42:05,489
What is it?

601
00:42:06,460 --> 00:42:07,589
Focus, guys.

602
00:42:08,429 --> 00:42:10,129
You'll soon be crying...

603
00:42:10,130 --> 00:42:11,360
after the state mock exam.

604
00:42:12,360 --> 00:42:13,369
Let's continue.

00:42:14,100 --> 00:42:17,068
"In 1967, Uiam Dam was built across Shinhyeongang Valley..."

606
00:42:17,069 --> 00:42:18,599
"where Bukhan River..."

607
00:42:18,600 --> 00:42:20,069
- "and Soyang River meet." - Mr. Lee.

608
00:42:21,569 --> 00:42:23,069
Tell us about your first love.

609
00:42:26,440 --> 00:42:29,179
Mr. Lee, did you really date Ms. Seo in high school?

610
00:42:29,449 --> 00:42:30,819
That's sexy.

611
00:42:30,980 --> 00:42:33,520
Don't be rude like some common thug.

612
00:42:33,619 --> 00:42:34,719
How's that rude?

613
00:42:35,489 --> 00:42:36,520
Hong Ju Hwan.

614
00:42:37,520 --> 00:42:39,159
- Yes? - Pack your bag and leave.

615
00:42:41,290 --> 00:42:43,500
- Sorry? - Ask for a refund.

616
00:42:44,529 --> 00:42:46,900
- Why? - That was sexual harassment.

617
00:42:48,330 --> 00:42:49,869
Apologize to the rest and leave.

618
00:42:50,239 --> 00:42:51,798
Mr. Lee, I was only joking.

619
00:42:51,799 --> 00:42:53,468
- Seong U and Do Yun. - Yes?

620
00:42:53,469 --> 00:42:54,569
You've been warned.

621
00:42:56,110 --> 00:42:57,880
You messed with the wrong person.

622
00:42:59,380 --> 00:43:01,779
Did you think those questions would faze me in any way?

623
00:43:03,049 --> 00:43:06,049
Did you think I'd beg for you to stay in my class?

624
00:43:10,319 --> 00:43:11,420
You should've left already.

625
00:43:12,719 --> 00:43:14,860
"The river became a lake and..."

626
00:43:18,130 --> 00:43:19,460

Yes?

629
00:43:47,460 --> 00:43:48,889
I bet it came as a shock.

630
00:43:51,460 --> 00:43:52,560
Gosh.

631
00:44:03,210 --> 00:44:06,179
If only I could say that things will get better.

632
00:44:06,480 --> 00:44:07,909
Never have I...

633
00:44:08,409 --> 00:44:10,750
issued so many refunds on classes before.

634
00:44:11,449 --> 00:44:13,179
Meanwhile, I turned off my phone.

635
00:44:16,049 --> 00:44:17,089
Ms. Kim.

636
00:44:17,889 --> 00:44:19,060
When do you open your academy?

637
00:44:19,389 --> 00:44:23,028
Where on earth did that come from?

638
00:44:23,029 --> 00:44:25,799
Maybe you should make a move since push has come to shove.

639
00:44:26,159 --> 00:44:29,069
When you do, take me with you. I'm too worried to stay here.

640
00:44:34,139 --> 00:44:35,770
When an academy closes its doors,

641
00:44:36,040 --> 00:44:37,839
it won't hurt the instructors.

642
00:44:38,679 --> 00:44:40,009
There are many other academies.

643
00:44:41,380 --> 00:44:42,579
If that isn't an option,

644
00:44:42,580 --> 00:44:45,318
they could make a living off tutoring sessions.

645
00:44:45,319 --> 00:44:47,049
Come on.

646
00:44:52,989 --> 00:44:54,230
I have it the worst...

647
00:44:55,029 --> 00:44:56,560
at this academy.

648
00:44:57,029 --> 00:44:58,130
Come on.

649
00:44:59,259 --> 00:45:00,730
That isn't true.

650
00:45:01,569 --> 00:45:03,029
There's Seo Hye Jin.

651
00:45:09,770 --> 00:45:12,238
- It's Seo Hye Jin. - Did you hear the rumor?

652
00:45:12,239 --> 00:45:13,380
Sick, isn't it?

653
00:45:17,580 --> 00:45:18,580
Ms. Seo.

654
00:45:19,119 --> 00:45:21,489
Why don't I go in first and get started on the test?

655

I'm sure you heard...

659

that your class has been filled.

660
00:45:54,420 --> 00:45:55,420
Yes.

661
00:45:56,049 --> 00:45:58,790
It's something to congratulate. I'm happy for you.

662
00:46:01,060 --> 00:46:02,290
The admin team told me...

663
00:46:03,089 --> 00:46:05,360
that it saw a rush of students today.

664
00:46:06,130 --> 00:46:07,569
It must be one of these two cases.

665
00:46:08,199 --> 00:46:09,928
Either the top student enrolled in it,

666
00:46:09,929 --> 00:46:11,469
or many came with the most popular kid in school.

667
00:46:12,639 --> 00:46:13,908
Those students...

668
00:46:13,909 --> 00:46:16,040
are better than thousands of flyers.

669
00:46:17,239 --> 00:46:19,980
Manage your classes well from here on out,

670
00:46:20,350 --> 00:46:22,009
and you'll soon find your ground here.

671
00:46:24,219 --> 00:46:25,250

672
00:46:26,080 --> 00:46:27,249
about the rumor.

673
00:46:27,250 --> 00:46:28,290
What rumor?

674
00:46:30,489 --> 00:46:31,860
The one regarding Ms. Seo and Mr. Lee.

675
00:46:31,989 --> 00:46:33,020
Oh, that.

676
00:46:34,029 --> 00:46:35,290
I heard that too.

677
00:46:37,199 --> 00:46:39,028
Out of your new students,

678
00:46:39,029 --> 00:46:40,699
you'll have to pay...

679
00:46:41,270 --> 00:46:44,670
closer attention to Sung Ha Yul and Lee Jung Soo.

680
00:46:45,299 --> 00:46:47,068
They have the best grades and...

681
00:46:47,069 --> 00:46:48,839
I somewhat know those two.

682
00:46:49,610 --> 00:46:51,080
Sung Ha Yul and Lee Jung Soo?

683
00:46:52,540 --> 00:46:53,779
No, Seo Hye Jin and Lee Jun Ho.

684
00:47:04,060 --> 00:47:06,060
I'm aware that you met...

685
00:47:06,460 --> 00:47:07,889
with Seo Hye Jin.

686
00:47:09,230 --> 00:47:10,330
Was Lee Jun Ho also there?

687
00:47:11,560 --> 00:47:12,600
Yes.

688
00:47:14,170 --> 00:47:15,199
So?

689
00:47:16,969 --> 00:47:18,600
The rumor isn't true.

690
00:47:18,969 --> 00:47:20,199
They aren't that kind of people.

691
00:47:20,710 --> 00:47:21,869
So?

692
00:47:22,069 --> 00:47:23,710
I'm not comfortable taking students...

693
00:47:24,239 --> 00:47:25,480
who enrolled in my class because of it.

694
00:47:25,739 --> 00:47:26,839
So?

695
00:47:28,650 --> 00:47:30,850
- Sorry? - Aren't you going to teach them?

696
00:47:38,389 --> 00:47:41,690
I taught at a school for 20 years myself.

697
00:47:42,730 --> 00:47:44,429
Our career paths are similar.

698
00:47:46,100 --> 00:47:48,199
I'm well aware that it isn't easy...

699
00:47:48,699 --> 00:47:52,568
to change the way you think or how you conduct yourself.

700
00:47:52,569 --> 00:47:53,600
However,

701
00:47:55,239 --> 00:47:56,710
it's been nearly a month...

702
00:47:57,810 --> 00:47:59,779
since your resignation was finalized.

703
00:48:01,250 --> 00:48:04,519
This isn't because I used to be a school teacher.

704
00:48:04,520 --> 00:48:07,020
Many good things happened to me...

705
00:48:07,719 --> 00:48:09,719
after you decided to join this academy.

706
00:48:11,290 --> 00:48:13,290
I'm grateful for that,

707
00:48:14,560 --> 00:48:18,360
and I believe all that's left is for us to focus on our teamwork.

708
00:48:19,199 --> 00:48:20,670
But you're not helping anyone...

709
00:48:22,069 --> 00:48:23,500
by acting this way.

710
00:48:25,869 --> 00:48:26,969
I don't follow.

711
00:48:28,839 --> 00:48:29,909
This...

712
00:48:30,779 --> 00:48:32,238
isn't a school...

713
00:48:32,239 --> 00:48:34,549
where new students automatically fill the classroom...

714
00:48:34,810 --> 00:48:36,779
every year.

715
00:48:38,250 --> 00:48:41,520
This isn't a cushy government job.

716
00:48:44,290 --> 00:48:45,460
Why are you looking at me like that?

717
00:48:46,319 --> 00:48:47,389
Mom.

718
00:48:48,360 --> 00:48:50,290
Starting next month, you'll study at Choisun Academy.

719
00:48:50,400 --> 00:48:51,600
But I don't want to.

720
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:53,199
Why not?

721
00:48:53,259 --> 00:48:56,270
What's his name? You didn't mind Pyo Sang Sub's free lecture.

722
00:48:56,630 --> 00:48:57,940
But I like Ms. Seo.

723
00:48:58,639 --> 00:49:00,068
Not her. She's doomed.

724
00:49:00,069 --> 00:49:01,408
Mom, please.

725
00:49:01,409 --> 00:49:02,739
Didn't you hear the rumor?

726
00:49:03,040 --> 00:49:04,409
Did you see it yourself?

727
00:49:04,580 --> 00:49:06,739
Did you see them in a compromising position?

728
00:49:06,909 --> 00:49:08,080
As if I have to see it to know.

729
00:49:09,049 --> 00:49:10,579
How dare they do this when it's crucial...

730
00:49:10,580 --> 00:49:12,049
to set the tone for students?

731
00:49:12,580 --> 00:49:14,350
What would you even learn from them?

732
00:49:15,619 --> 00:49:16,690
Darn it.

733
00:49:21,230 --> 00:49:24,159
If you don't do your assignments by our next class, you'll see blood.

734
00:49:24,929 --> 00:49:26,798
I may look like a fragile garden cosmos,

735
00:49:26,799 --> 00:49:28,230
but I have the strength of a champion.

736
00:49:28,270 --> 00:49:30,029
Ms. Nam, you're nothing like a garden cosmos.

737
00:49:30,330 --> 00:49:32,639
You really should be cutting back on the tanghulu.

738
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:34,069
Got it.

739
00:49:35,310 --> 00:49:36,939
Thanks for the class.

740
00:49:36,940 --> 00:49:38,139
Sure. Have a good night.

741
00:49:53,719 --> 00:49:54,830
Did you have a nice class?

742
00:49:55,659 --> 00:49:58,060
Well, yes. It was okay.

743
00:49:59,259 --> 00:50:01,029
I bet you couldn't focus because of the recent incident.

744
00:50:04,239 --> 00:50:06,239
By the way, what brings you here?

745
00:50:06,440 --> 00:50:07,540
No reason.

746
00:50:08,440 --> 00:50:09,440
I was just curious...

747
00:50:10,509 --> 00:50:12,110
what you planned to do next.

748
00:50:15,350 --> 00:50:16,409
Did you get...

749
00:50:17,779 --> 00:50:19,219
a heads-up or something...

750
00:50:20,179 --> 00:50:21,449
before things hit the fan?

751
00:50:25,360 --> 00:50:27,690
You seemed especially calm compared to other people.

752
00:50:28,389 --> 00:50:29,730
You also seemed at ease around Mr. Lee.

753
00:50:33,730 --> 00:50:34,830
Gosh.

754
00:50:35,569 --> 00:50:36,630
What is it?

755
00:50:38,639 --> 00:50:39,639
I mean,

756
00:50:40,770 --> 00:50:42,069
my opinion of you has changed.

757
00:50:43,739 --> 00:50:45,040
You have...

758
00:50:46,580 --> 00:50:48,080
an edge.

759
00:50:51,679 --> 00:50:54,420
I know you're being sarcastic, but I'll take it as a compliment.

760
00:50:55,949 --> 00:50:56,949
So tell me.

761
00:50:57,690 --> 00:50:59,190
I'd like to know what you knew before it all went down.

762
00:51:00,420 --> 00:51:02,929
I knew that Ms. Seo and Mr. Lee were dating.

763
00:51:04,159 --> 00:51:05,759
I also knew that their relationship didn't have any improper nature...

764
00:51:05,860 --> 00:51:06,860
contrary to the gossip.

765
00:51:09,270 --> 00:51:10,270
All of it?

766
00:51:10,429 --> 00:51:13,239
I knew that Ms. Woo recently plotted this.

767
00:51:16,110 --> 00:51:17,940
Do you work for the NIS? You know everything.

768
00:51:21,279 --> 00:51:22,380
Then...

769
00:51:24,119 --> 00:51:25,520
did Ms. Woo make an offer?

770
00:51:27,650 --> 00:51:31,119
Isn't the exchange of information usually 2-sided, not 1-sided?

771
00:51:31,860 --> 00:51:33,159
Do I owe you any information?

772
00:51:34,489 --> 00:51:35,489
I see.

773
00:51:37,460 --> 00:51:39,000
That's too bad. I have no information to offer.

774
00:51:39,630 --> 00:51:42,130
I found out about their relationship only yesterday.

775
00:51:52,409 --> 00:51:53,440
All right.

776
00:51:54,880 --> 00:51:55,980
I'll head out first.

777
00:51:57,179 --> 00:51:58,420
You should wrap up.

778
00:51:59,250 --> 00:52:00,279
Okay.

779
00:52:40,159 --> 00:52:41,489
Did you finish your class?

780
00:52:42,529 --> 00:52:43,529
Yes.

781
00:52:53,199 --> 00:52:54,839
The lecture room is way too big.

782
00:52:57,980 --> 00:52:59,779
I only had 13 students...

783
00:53:00,040 --> 00:53:01,810
in this big lecture room today.

784
00:53:04,580 --> 00:53:06,520
Ten out of those thirteen students...

785
00:53:07,219 --> 00:53:10,049
kept staring at my face, not the blackboard the whole class.

786
00:53:12,159 --> 00:53:13,190
It was like...

787
00:53:13,290 --> 00:53:15,929
they were looking at a celebrity who caused a big scandal.

788
00:54:25,560 --> 00:54:27,199
That jerk has lost it.

789
00:54:29,069 --> 00:54:30,069
What is it?

790
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:32,500
If you're curious, come and look at it yourself.

791
00:54:32,799 --> 00:54:33,969
I think he did this for us to see.

792
00:54:39,739 --> 00:54:41,179
You should leave the academy, Ms. Nam.

793
00:54:43,850 --> 00:54:47,179
I know better than anyone that your class is top-notch.

794
00:54:49,020 --> 00:54:50,719
But this incident will affect you too.

795
00:54:52,360 --> 00:54:53,819
You worked so hard to gather these students.

796
00:54:54,830 --> 00:54:56,360
It might be hard for you to maintain them.

797
00:54:58,699 --> 00:55:00,529
I thought about doing so too.

798
00:55:04,069 --> 00:55:05,540
But that's such a low move. I can't do it.

799
00:55:08,409 --> 00:55:10,610
You sort of figured it out, didn't you?

800
00:55:13,210 --> 00:55:16,380
I haven't achieved or gained much in life.

801
00:55:18,279 --> 00:55:20,178
I don't have anyone or any assets to rely on.

802
00:55:20,179 --> 00:55:21,520
I have only myself to believe in.

803
00:55:22,219 --> 00:55:24,420
So I live off confidence and self-esteem.

804
00:55:25,520 --> 00:55:26,790
That's your charm.

805
00:55:30,060 --> 00:55:32,060
That's why I won't join the others.

806
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:37,230
I'll play with you.

807
00:55:40,940 --> 00:55:41,969
I'm sorry.

808
00:55:59,159 --> 00:56:00,790
Where did Mr. Lee go?

809
00:56:02,529 --> 00:56:03,630
I'm not sure.

810
00:56:25,250 --> 00:56:26,949
Something urgent came up for me. So I'm leaving.

811
00:56:28,290 --> 00:56:30,319
I wanted to be with you today no matter what.

812
00:56:30,520 --> 00:56:31,889
But I can't say no to this appointment.

813
00:56:33,259 --> 00:56:34,389
Make sure to eat.

814
00:56:35,429 --> 00:56:36,489
I love you.

815
00:56:37,130 --> 00:56:38,199
I'll call you.

816
00:56:44,100 --> 00:56:46,040
Mr. Lee is on a protest right now.

817
00:56:56,310 --> 00:56:57,409
You're making me curious.

818
00:57:13,029 --> 00:57:14,159
Mr. Lee...

819
00:57:15,469 --> 00:57:17,330
He's not an easy guy to handle.

820
00:57:18,069 --> 00:57:19,900
He stubbornly wrote this, so everyone could read it.

821
00:57:37,049 --> 00:57:38,889
I don't have to play with you today, right?

822
00:57:39,920 --> 00:57:41,330
Mr. Lee will call you, right?

823
00:57:42,489 --> 00:57:43,730
I have somewhere to be.

824
00:57:49,170 --> 00:57:50,199
Bye.

825
00:58:06,020 --> 00:58:07,650
Did your class go well today?

826
00:58:10,150 --> 00:58:11,159
Yes.

827
00:58:11,489 --> 00:58:12,520
What about Hye Jin's class?

828
00:58:20,830 --> 00:58:21,869
Did you know?

829
00:58:23,000 --> 00:58:25,238
When you wanted to join the academy,

830
00:58:25,239 --> 00:58:27,639
Hye Jin was dead set against it.

831
00:58:29,610 --> 00:58:30,839
I know about that.

832
00:58:33,310 --> 00:58:35,310
I should have listened to her.

833
00:58:36,949 --> 00:58:38,380
Had I done what she said,

834
00:58:39,119 --> 00:58:41,290
I would've easily gotten what I wanted.

835
00:58:51,199 --> 00:58:52,230
Thank you.

836
00:58:52,860 --> 00:58:55,000
You look so glum.

837
00:58:57,739 --> 00:58:59,069
It must be the lights here.

838
00:58:59,699 --> 00:59:00,770
I'm fine.

839
00:59:01,139 --> 00:59:02,610
Oh, aren't I glad to hear that?

840
00:59:40,239 --> 00:59:42,250
To catch the fish

841
00:59:42,380 --> 00:59:47,548
I am the romantic cat

842
00:59:47,549 --> 00:59:50,850
- What's going on? - The small, dancing starlight

843
00:59:50,949 --> 00:59:53,789
Shines on the sad city

844
00:59:53,790 --> 00:59:59,330
- I am the romantic cat - The romantic cat

845
00:59:59,460 --> 01:00:02,329
My sad, deep ocean

846
01:00:02,330 --> 01:00:08,139
Has left all alone

847
01:00:11,239 --> 01:00:12,310
Why aren't you singing?

848
01:00:18,480 --> 01:00:20,250
Was I mistaken?

849
01:00:21,089 --> 01:00:22,489
I thought instructors never did anything...

850
01:00:22,989 --> 01:00:24,690
that would risk them losing their voices.

851
01:00:25,619 --> 01:00:26,759
Gosh, we don't.

852
01:00:27,420 --> 01:00:28,489
Then what?

853
01:00:34,029 --> 01:00:35,069
Did something happen?

854
01:00:39,270 --> 01:00:40,770
It was a huge mess.

855
01:00:42,239 --> 01:00:43,339
I told you, didn't I?

856
01:00:43,739 --> 01:00:47,679
The hyenas would be attacking Mr. Lee and Ms. Seo.

857
01:00:48,179 --> 01:00:50,610
What does that have to do with you here,

858
01:00:50,710 --> 01:00:51,779
singing at the top of your lungs?

859
01:00:53,750 --> 01:00:55,549
I decided not to play their game.

860
01:00:58,389 --> 01:01:00,560
After deciding that, I felt somewhat liberated.

861
01:01:02,190 --> 01:01:04,460
I bet you're brimming with self-love too.

862
01:01:09,500 --> 01:01:11,540
After all that, I thought of...

863
01:01:12,639 --> 01:01:13,639
you.

864
01:01:19,810 --> 01:01:21,448
I used to think...

865
01:01:21,449 --> 01:01:24,580
it was ridiculous how people wasted their energy on dating or love.

866
01:01:29,250 --> 01:01:30,290
But not anymore?

867
01:01:32,259 --> 01:01:33,290
Well,

868
01:01:34,290 --> 01:01:35,830
after seeing Ms. Seo,

869
01:01:37,060 --> 01:01:40,029
I thought the contrary of my thought could be true.

870
01:01:47,270 --> 01:01:48,339
Let's get out of here.

871
01:01:50,239 --> 01:01:52,480
- I have ten minutes left. - Gosh.

872
01:01:53,009 --> 01:01:55,379
Unless you want me to confess to you under these lights,

873
01:01:55,380 --> 01:01:57,350
get your things now. All right.

874
01:01:58,850 --> 01:01:59,949
I don't care.

875
01:02:03,089 --> 01:02:04,619
- Do you mean that? - Yes.

876
01:02:05,489 --> 01:02:07,619
Personally, the content matters, not the form.

877
01:02:21,839 --> 01:02:23,040
I like you.

878
01:02:24,710 --> 01:02:25,810
You're cool.

879
01:02:26,409 --> 01:02:27,480
You make me...

880
01:02:28,779 --> 01:02:30,380
want to get to know you more.

881
01:02:35,619 --> 01:02:37,449
Going on a regular date like other couples will be hard.

882
01:02:38,920 --> 01:02:40,719
I'll always finish working in the middle of the night.

883
01:02:41,230 --> 01:02:42,759
I can't go to amusement parks on weekends either.

884
01:02:44,600 --> 01:02:46,130
On the days I teach for ten hours,

885
01:02:46,659 --> 01:02:48,299
I can't play with you because I won't have any energy left.

886
01:02:51,869 --> 01:02:53,199
I told you I had no problem playing alone.

887
01:03:24,799 --> 01:03:26,139
I didn't eat anything the whole day.

888
01:03:31,710 --> 01:03:33,739
(Daechi Chase)

889
01:03:51,060 --> 01:03:52,130
You know,

890
01:03:53,259 --> 01:03:55,429
I've been thinking.

891
01:04:03,339 --> 01:04:06,880
What do you think about leaving the academy?

892
01:04:13,779 --> 01:04:14,819
Well...

893
01:04:17,589 --> 01:04:18,619
If I do that,

894
01:04:20,460 --> 01:04:22,560
it will be the same as acknowledging the rumor to be true.

895
01:04:25,029 --> 01:04:27,759
Yoon Ji Seok has a good reputation among the instructors.

896
01:04:28,230 --> 01:04:29,500
He has influence too.

897
01:04:30,929 --> 01:04:35,069
If you leave, we might be able to calm him down for now.

898
01:04:35,869 --> 01:04:38,408
Anyway, I need to show him that...

899
01:04:38,409 --> 01:04:41,279
I am just as enraged about the recent incident.

900
01:04:43,549 --> 01:04:46,619
Please pardon my expression. But to make it effective,

901
01:04:47,020 --> 01:04:48,949
I should kick out Hye Jin.

902
01:04:51,389 --> 01:04:53,989
Don't look at me like that. I won't do that either.

903
01:04:55,929 --> 01:04:59,460
It's not like she can pursue another career path.

904
01:05:02,469 --> 01:05:04,699
How could I do that to her when I made her stay in this industry?

905
01:05:05,969 --> 01:05:07,040
I bought her a car.

906
01:05:07,670 --> 01:05:10,270
I helped her pay for her brother's tuition and gave her bonuses.

907
01:05:11,409 --> 01:05:13,610
I indirectly made her delay going back to school too.

908
01:05:14,339 --> 01:05:17,449
Then I made her miss the last bar exam.

909
01:05:22,619 --> 01:05:24,989
(Outline of the Administrative Law)

910
01:05:27,719 --> 01:05:28,889
But as for you,

911
01:05:29,630 --> 01:05:31,230
you can go anywhere you want.

912
01:05:32,799 --> 01:05:34,159
If you want, you can join a major academy.

913
01:05:34,529 --> 01:05:35,600
If you set your mind to it,

914
01:05:36,199 --> 01:05:37,869
you can get a job at a conglomerate again.

915
01:05:37,969 --> 01:05:39,869
Or you can take a break. You know?

916
01:05:39,969 --> 01:05:41,509
Your parents are well-off.

917
01:05:46,839 --> 01:05:49,479
Everyone in this neighborhood is throwing stones at her.

918
01:05:49,480 --> 01:05:50,750
And you want me to leave...

919
01:05:51,110 --> 01:05:53,919
I'm trying to pacify those people who are throwing stones at her...

920
01:05:53,920 --> 01:05:55,419
for Hye Jin's sake.

921
01:05:55,420 --> 01:05:56,489
I don't want to do that.

922
01:05:58,420 --> 01:06:00,420
I'll switch to a bigger academy someday.

923
01:06:01,589 --> 01:06:02,589
But not now.

924
01:06:04,900 --> 01:06:06,060
Gosh.

925
01:06:09,929 --> 01:06:12,040
I know that you're not affected by them.

926
01:06:13,540 --> 01:06:15,638
You weren't even embarrassed to show your report card...

927
01:06:15,639 --> 01:06:16,969
when you ranked in the eighth class.

928
01:06:19,779 --> 01:06:21,850
You're not even scared to work here...

929
01:06:22,049 --> 01:06:23,210
after quitting your job at that fancy company.

930
01:06:23,980 --> 01:06:26,079
Nothing in this world must scare you.

931
01:06:26,080 --> 01:06:27,119
No.

932
01:06:31,420 --> 01:06:32,489
I'm scared.

933
01:06:36,130 --> 01:06:38,529
I have never been as scared in my life as I am today.

934
01:06:39,460 --> 01:06:40,500
What do you...

935
01:06:56,009 --> 01:06:57,049
What...

936
01:07:02,690 --> 01:07:03,750
Ms. Seo...

937
01:07:10,560 --> 01:07:13,100
Everything she has done until now has broken down all at once.

938
01:07:20,670 --> 01:07:22,139
Gosh.

939
01:07:23,469 --> 01:07:25,278
I'm about to destroy the academy...

940
01:07:25,279 --> 01:07:27,139
I considered to be my alma mater.

941
01:07:29,250 --> 01:07:31,480
Okay. So...

942
01:07:37,750 --> 01:07:39,758
I keep trying to think of a way to fix this.

943
01:07:39,759 --> 01:07:41,560
But my mind keeps wandering.

944
01:07:48,770 --> 01:07:50,400
"Should I not have joined the academy?"

945
01:07:52,440 --> 01:07:54,469
"Should I have been nicer to my colleagues?"

946
01:07:55,239 --> 01:07:56,310
No.

947
01:07:57,009 --> 01:07:58,239
Listen. I'm trying to say...

948
01:07:59,080 --> 01:08:01,080
I also... Gosh.

949
01:08:02,250 --> 01:08:04,810
I also tried to find a way to fix this. You know?

950
01:08:08,750 --> 01:08:10,049
I'm a fool...

951
01:08:10,449 --> 01:08:13,420
who only thought about fulfilling my self-interest.

952
01:08:15,790 --> 01:08:17,230
So I'm so scared to death.

953
01:08:21,730 --> 01:08:22,969
Mr. Lee.

954
01:08:26,499 --> 01:08:27,940
Calm down.

955
01:09:08,379 --> 01:09:12,219
(The Midnight Romance in Hagwon)

956
01:09:12,379 --> 01:09:13,979
I'm embarrassed about everything that it's driving me crazy.

957
01:09:13,980 --> 01:09:15,388
You're the one who cried and acted like a baby.

958
01:09:15,389 --> 01:09:16,549
Why are you insulting me?

959
01:09:16,650 --> 01:09:18,589
"How would it have been if I wasn't your teacher?"

960
01:09:18,660 --> 01:09:20,190
"Then this kind of rumor wouldn't have spread."

961
01:09:20,459 --> 01:09:22,329
No one can voice their opinions to me about...

962
01:09:22,560 --> 01:09:24,230
how I run my business.

963
01:09:24,259 --> 01:09:26,759
Where are they? The people responsible for this incident.

964
01:09:26,929 --> 01:09:28,230
You really know nothing about this?

965
01:09:28,570 --> 01:09:29,999
I think there will be an offer.

966
01:09:30,829 --> 01:09:31,969
Come to your senses...

967
01:09:32,270 --> 01:09:33,469
before you sink any further.

968
01:09:33,700 --> 01:09:35,169
Who do you think has hit bottom?

969
01:09:35,270 --> 01:09:36,370
Have you lost your mind?

970
01:09:37,169 --> 01:09:39,810
Give it to me now. My well-deserved diploma.
