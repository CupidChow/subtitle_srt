 The Midnight Romance in Hagwon

00:00:44,140 --> 00:00:52,160


14
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:55,670
I don't think it's for consultation.

15
00:00:55,670 --> 00:00:59,130
He said you'd know the name "Pyo Sang Seob".

16
00:01:02,570 --> 00:01:04,480
Is something going on?

17
00:01:05,560 --> 00:01:07,300
Yes.

18
00:01:07,300 --> 00:01:10,710
Someone's here to see me, apparently.

19
00:01:10,710 --> 00:01:15,030
Team Leader, Mr. Pyo is here. By chance...

20
00:01:15,030 --> 00:01:17,190
He apparently came to see me.

21
00:01:52,850 --> 00:01:55,030
Long time no see.

22
00:01:55,860 --> 00:01:57,910
Yes.

23
00:01:57,910 --> 00:02:01,380
Long time no see, Mr. Pyo.

24
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,990
 Episode 10 
 Pyo Sang Seob.

25
00:02:05,990 --> 00:02:08,400
Pyo Sang Seob?

26
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:10,940
I've heard of that name.

27
00:02:17,450 --> 00:02:19,270
My gosh.

28
00:02:21,700 --> 00:02:24,160
Have a seat over there.

29
00:02:28,170 --> 00:02:29,920
 Consultation in progress 

30
00:02:56,350 --> 00:03:00,080
What? You don't even knock anymo—

31
00:03:01,790 --> 00:03:04,000
What are you doing?

32
00:03:07,910 --> 00:03:09,760
I can't hear anything.

33
00:03:10,830 --> 00:03:15,120
I don't even have a clue.

34
00:03:26,930 --> 00:03:30,740
Don't be too nervous.

35
00:03:30,740 --> 00:03:33,270
I just stopped by to say hello.

36
00:03:34,270 --> 00:03:35,820
You're making me even more nervous.

37
00:03:35,820 --> 00:03:39,720
I don't think we're close enough to drop by for a hello.

38
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:44,590
We met during the midterm period last time.

39
00:03:46,450 --> 00:03:52,590
Once at the teachers' office and once at some Japanese restaurant.

40
00:03:53,320 --> 00:03:55,690
We met twice.

41
00:03:55,690 --> 00:03:57,650
Yes.

42
00:03:57,650 --> 00:03:59,430
Since then,

43
00:04:00,940 --> 00:04:04,400
I always felt like I was

44
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:06,660
accompanied by you, Teacher.

45
00:04:09,220 --> 00:04:10,970
 I apologize for not addressing you properly. 

46
00:04:10,970 --> 00:04:14,430
 I can't bring myself to call you "Teacher." 

47
00:04:15,370 --> 00:04:19,540
Are you surprised that I called you "Teacher"?

48
00:04:20,950 --> 00:04:23,270
Yes, a little.

49
00:04:23,270 --> 00:04:25,920
I owe you an apology first.

50
00:04:27,020 --> 00:04:29,960
You never know what can happen in life.

51
00:04:30,930 --> 00:04:33,230
I was too careless.

52
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:42,430
I had no idea I'd be surrendering like this.

53
00:04:46,490 --> 00:04:50,570
Do you not understand what that means?

54
00:04:50,570 --> 00:04:53,680
No, please make it clear.

55
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:57,690
What do you mean you always felt like I accompanied you

56
00:04:57,690 --> 00:05:00,850
and you're surrendering?

57
00:05:03,420 --> 00:05:05,740
I quit my job at the school.

58
00:05:08,410 --> 00:05:11,390
To be specific, I submitted my resignation letter.

59
00:05:12,940 --> 00:05:15,850
There are still more steps to go through.

60
00:05:15,850 --> 00:05:18,090
Awaiting approvals by the principal and the Office of Education.

61
00:05:18,090 --> 00:05:20,300
There are many more steps.

62
00:05:22,250 --> 00:05:24,060
What did you just say...

63
00:05:24,060 --> 00:05:27,290
I'm sorry. I...

64
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:31,040
I'm not sure what you're talking about.

65
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:34,210
I mean, why...

66
00:05:34,210 --> 00:05:36,870
Why did you make that decision—

67
00:05:36,870 --> 00:05:41,410
It's a bit hard to call it a decision.

68
00:05:41,410 --> 00:05:43,150
I just...

69
00:05:45,420 --> 00:05:48,770
wonder if this was meant to be.

70
00:05:48,770 --> 00:05:51,260
- By chance—
 - Yes.

71
00:05:52,090 --> 00:05:55,760
Since our meeting at the teachers' office.

72
00:05:58,120 --> 00:06:03,570
I need you to explain so I can understand.

73
00:06:03,570 --> 00:06:07,850
Did you see the final exam questions?

74
00:06:07,850 --> 00:06:11,170
- Yes. 
 - What did you think of the quality?

75
00:06:11,170 --> 00:06:12,770
I don't know why you're asking me that.

76
00:06:12,770 --> 00:06:16,130
It's not my job to assess things like that.

77
00:06:22,760 --> 00:06:26,050
"Chanyeong High's exams are advanced.

78
00:06:27,490 --> 00:06:30,420
The midterm questions were refreshing."

79
00:06:30,420 --> 00:06:32,440
Well...

80
00:06:32,440 --> 00:06:35,770
those are all your words.

81
00:06:35,770 --> 00:06:37,430
Don't you remember?

82
00:06:37,430 --> 00:06:42,590
I was trying to say I understood the purpose of the questions.

83
00:06:48,190 --> 00:06:50,420
Ever since you stopped by...

84
00:06:51,870 --> 00:06:55,000
the teachers' office, then,

85
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,700
I was...

86
00:06:58,100 --> 00:07:00,450
completely ruined.

87
00:07:01,340 --> 00:07:07,140
I wanted to prove the power of public education that the academies cannot reach.

88
00:07:07,140 --> 00:07:09,550
But that ended up becoming poison.

89
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:14,970
Since then, I couldn't stop thinking about the academies.

90
00:07:14,970 --> 00:07:18,890
"How do they teach this text at the academies?

91
00:07:18,890 --> 00:07:23,360
Do they teach the entire text for this?

92
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:27,380
Would they think this question is hard or not?"

93
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:31,870
The academies... The academies...

94
00:07:32,730 --> 00:07:34,360
The academies...

95
00:07:39,050 --> 00:07:40,830
That's why

96
00:07:40,830 --> 00:07:44,480
it felt like I was accompanied by you

97
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:47,880
while teaching the entire semester.

98
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:53,100
It's so foolish that I realized that now.

99
00:07:53,960 --> 00:07:57,760
But you didn't have to quit your job.

100
00:07:58,940 --> 00:08:03,800
Did you hear what I told the students since that day?

101
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:07,170
The exams will 100% be based on the textbook.

102
00:08:07,170 --> 00:08:09,980
No comparison texts. Essay questions—

103
00:08:09,980 --> 00:08:12,110
Those are just the exam rules.

104
00:08:12,110 --> 00:08:15,640
I'm talking about the reason why I said that.

105
00:08:15,640 --> 00:08:17,530
No, no.

106
00:08:17,530 --> 00:08:19,620
I don't know.

107
00:08:20,540 --> 00:08:22,780
You probably haven't heard.

108
00:08:24,010 --> 00:08:26,600
I didn't have a chance to talk about it.

109
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:30,020
When people ask me why,

110
00:08:30,020 --> 00:08:34,410
I wanted to give an impressive answer. So I prepared for it.

111
00:08:35,420 --> 00:08:40,530
On what it means to read a textbook properly.

112
00:08:40,530 --> 00:08:44,840
And what I want to teach the students.

113
00:08:47,130 --> 00:08:50,130
But no one asked me those questions.

114
00:08:51,230 --> 00:08:54,680
They just thought it was anger and insecurity

115
00:08:54,680 --> 00:08:57,420
toward the academy teacher

116
00:08:57,420 --> 00:08:59,230
for the humiliation.

117
00:09:00,130 --> 00:09:02,700
It was no more or less than that.

118
00:09:07,370 --> 00:09:09,800
I don't feel resentful.

119
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:11,770
Thinking now,

120
00:09:13,140 --> 00:09:16,230
I wasn't exactly innocent myself.

121
00:09:23,140 --> 00:09:25,430
Whether it's about the lecture or exam quality,

122
00:09:25,430 --> 00:09:29,100
as a teacher to question... I mean,

123
00:09:29,100 --> 00:09:32,520
to reflect on it is a good...

124
00:09:33,820 --> 00:09:35,780
a very necessary...

125
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:38,240
step, I think.

126
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:41,160
Yes, that's true.

127
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,980
But I...

128
00:09:48,670 --> 00:09:50,880
totally failed.

129
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:55,150
Both the students...

130
00:09:56,060 --> 00:09:58,590
and even my colleagues...

131
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:02,750
think of me as a bomb.

132
00:10:05,460 --> 00:10:08,470
The reason I didn't file a complaint

133
00:10:08,470 --> 00:10:12,170
through the academic committee is—

134
00:10:12,170 --> 00:10:16,970
It was to take care of the problem quickly.

135
00:10:17,770 --> 00:10:19,930
But actually,

136
00:10:21,340 --> 00:10:25,930
you were hoping to gain a reputation, weren't you?

137
00:10:27,530 --> 00:10:30,640
One that's only beneficial to you.

138
00:10:35,130 --> 00:10:40,930
I made this decision after thinking about that event countless times.

139
00:10:41,830 --> 00:10:45,300
If you had admitted the answer was controversial from the beginning—

140
00:10:45,300 --> 00:10:47,430
That probably

141
00:10:47,430 --> 00:10:52,980
made you a hero for the parents and students.

142
00:10:54,100 --> 00:10:57,320
But even if the fight blew up instead

143
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:03,190
and you didn't get what you wanted, it still would've been good.

144
00:11:04,710 --> 00:11:09,660
Because you would've been known as the warrior who faced the school directly.

145
00:11:11,770 --> 00:11:14,290
To put it simply,

146
00:11:14,290 --> 00:11:16,480
you...

147
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:21,500
had winning cards on both hands and

148
00:11:22,210 --> 00:11:23,750
I...

149
00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:27,810
took the bait.

150
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:33,100
In the academy industry,

151
00:11:33,100 --> 00:11:36,640
reputation is what the teachers need the most,

152
00:11:37,620 --> 00:11:41,300
and I heard it's also the most dangerous thing.

153
00:11:42,650 --> 00:11:45,490
 My reputation as the destroyer of the castle gate. 

154
00:11:45,490 --> 00:11:48,040
 And I want anger from the authority. 

155
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:50,940
 Anger will turn into attention, and that... 

156
00:11:50,940 --> 00:11:54,090
 would hold immeasurable value. 

157
00:12:03,110 --> 00:12:04,770
Yes.

158
00:12:20,110 --> 00:12:23,010
Tell no one to come into this room.

159
00:12:23,820 --> 00:12:27,150
- Team Leader.
 - I want you to leave, too, Mr. Lee.

160
00:12:33,250 --> 00:12:37,250
Is this Mr. Lee Jun Ho?

161
00:12:43,900 --> 00:12:46,100
I heard a lot about you.

162
00:12:46,100 --> 00:12:47,820
I'm Pyo Sang Seob.

163
00:12:49,490 --> 00:12:51,690
Oh, I see.

164
00:12:53,110 --> 00:12:55,150
Starting this break,

165
00:12:56,140 --> 00:12:58,860
I'll be working for Choeseon Korean.

166
00:13:03,300 --> 00:13:07,950
I've been wanting to meet you,

167
00:13:07,950 --> 00:13:13,550
but would it be okay if I spoke privately with Ms. Seo today?

168
00:13:14,310 --> 00:13:19,010
Yes, I'll leave you two alone, then.

169
00:13:36,430 --> 00:13:38,380
What's going on?

170
00:13:39,710 --> 00:13:42,670
Well, I don't know. He's from Choeseon Korean.

171
00:13:42,670 --> 00:13:45,610
What are you talking about? He's from Chanyeong High...

172
00:13:46,850 --> 00:13:48,670
My gosh!

173
00:13:48,670 --> 00:13:52,150
It's because of Ms. Seo.

174
00:13:52,150 --> 00:13:55,770
- What do you mean? 
 - Don't you remember?

175
00:13:55,770 --> 00:13:57,920
The new teachers don't know.

176
00:13:57,920 --> 00:14:01,830
They were hired after the last midterm.

177
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:04,510
This would be enough...

178
00:14:05,210 --> 00:14:08,570
to start my career at the academy

179
00:14:08,570 --> 00:14:11,530
with a lot of rumors, right?

180
00:14:13,420 --> 00:14:16,680
I think I should apologize to you—

181
00:14:16,680 --> 00:14:18,470
Apologize?

182
00:14:19,590 --> 00:14:21,660
If it were not for that,

183
00:14:22,460 --> 00:14:25,270
I wouldn't have known my whole life

184
00:14:25,270 --> 00:14:28,390
- You—
 - what's good for the students and...

185
00:14:29,330 --> 00:14:31,770
what the essence of teaching Korean is.

186
00:14:31,770 --> 00:14:33,380
Maybe...

187
00:14:34,920 --> 00:14:39,380
I was never interested in that myself.

188
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,940
I thought...

189
00:14:43,640 --> 00:14:49,010
you took pride in teaching in school more than anyone

190
00:14:49,010 --> 00:14:53,250
and you were probably respected by the students.

191
00:14:53,250 --> 00:14:55,750
That was what I thought.

192
00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:02,450
There was something interesting in the lobby.

193
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:06,300
"The Hall of Fame."

194
00:15:07,750 --> 00:15:12,580
Nothing is more worthwhile and honorable

195
00:15:12,580 --> 00:15:16,290
than sending students to good universities.

196
00:15:17,580 --> 00:15:21,130
Sending the kids to good schools makes us feel proud and worthy, right?

197
00:15:21,130 --> 00:15:23,920
- Let's cheer together. 
- Let's cheer together.

198
00:15:32,460 --> 00:15:34,260
How did you end up at Choeseon Korean?

199
00:15:34,260 --> 00:15:36,690
I received an offer.

200
00:15:36,690 --> 00:15:38,410
I was a bit surprised, too.

201
00:15:38,410 --> 00:15:43,170
I didn't think an academy in Daechi-dong would want an old hat like me.

202
00:15:43,170 --> 00:15:46,140
It will be way more cutthroat than you think.

203
00:15:46,140 --> 00:15:47,860
What is it?

204
00:15:47,860 --> 00:15:51,440
Do you think I won't send as many students to universities as you?

205
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:54,910
No, no, no. That's not what I meant.

206
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:02,180
I regret it.

207
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:05,030
It would've been nice...

208
00:16:06,310 --> 00:16:09,190
if I had joined this world a bit sooner.

209
00:16:09,780 --> 00:16:12,100
I would've felt much lighter...

210
00:16:12,900 --> 00:16:17,080
and I might've been a lot richer than I am now.

211
00:16:25,960 --> 00:16:27,700
Parasites.

212
00:16:29,710 --> 00:16:32,940
You said we were like parasites.

213
00:16:36,030 --> 00:16:37,740
That hurts.

214
00:16:41,570 --> 00:16:43,910
You looked so calm then.

215
00:16:44,580 --> 00:16:47,210
I had no idea you felt hurt.

216
00:16:47,210 --> 00:16:50,210
Because I thought it was my role to be

217
00:16:50,210 --> 00:16:53,280
called that if I could improve their grades.

218
00:16:53,280 --> 00:16:57,270
You have to endure that much pain.

219
00:17:00,660 --> 00:17:02,370
I'm learning that from you.

220
00:17:02,370 --> 00:17:07,070
I've met Director Choi of Choeseon Korean, too.

221
00:17:07,070 --> 00:17:11,280
She'll expect great results from you, as good as your offer is.

222
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:13,650
If you're so worried,

223
00:17:14,650 --> 00:17:18,770
would you send us some of your Chanyeong students?

224
00:17:30,540 --> 00:17:32,550
Yes, Teacher.

225
00:17:37,260 --> 00:17:41,130
I took a day off, and I'm out right now.

226
00:17:43,730 --> 00:17:47,430
No, you don't have to.

227
00:17:49,910 --> 00:17:52,020
If you must...

228
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,080
Yes, I know the place.

229
00:17:56,510 --> 00:17:58,060
Yes.

230
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:02,830
Okay, got it.

231
00:18:09,650 --> 00:18:16,080
The Chanyeong students won't join my class from the beginning.

232
00:18:18,130 --> 00:18:24,730
But I want to teach them in my own way.

233
00:18:26,490 --> 00:18:29,540
What can I do to gather students?

234
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:34,870
I'll be teaching a free lecture first. It'll be grand.

235
00:18:35,570 --> 00:18:38,490
You should ask your director about it.

236
00:18:40,370 --> 00:18:42,520
Yes.

237
00:18:42,520 --> 00:18:44,050
You're right.

238
00:18:46,170 --> 00:18:51,920
I heard you have a lot of Chanyeong students.

239
00:18:53,260 --> 00:18:55,920
So I wanted to get advice from you.

240
00:18:57,800 --> 00:19:01,580
But something urgent came up just now.

241
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:19,670
I won't see you off.

242
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:42,360
Let's have a meal together since we didn't get to last time.

243
00:20:08,520 --> 00:20:10,430
 Going upstairs. 

244
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:14,040
 The door is closing. 

245
00:20:14,040 --> 00:20:15,840
What?

246
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:18,880
- Wasn't that Mr. Pyo Sang Seob?
 - That was Sang Seob, right?

247
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:21,710
What's he doing here?

248
00:20:34,690 --> 00:20:37,180
The regular admission students will be classified based on the

249
00:20:37,180 --> 00:20:40,290
mock exam in September without a separate test.

250
00:20:40,290 --> 00:20:41,760
Okay.

251
00:20:45,100 --> 00:20:47,370
 Seo Hye Jin 

252
00:20:48,590 --> 00:20:51,200
Tell Ms. Gu In Hui and Ms. Cheon Su Yeon of the medical school class to come in.

253
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:53,630
I need to ask them about a question in the pre-10th-grade test.

254
00:20:53,630 --> 00:20:55,480
Okay.

255
00:20:55,480 --> 00:20:58,360
Schedule a dinner with Mr. Lee Sang Hyeon.

256
00:20:58,360 --> 00:21:00,460
I'll tell him the contract was terminated.

257
00:21:00,460 --> 00:21:04,390
He might refuse to have dinner.

258
00:21:04,390 --> 00:21:07,950
Looks like he knows his contract won't be renewed.

259
00:21:07,950 --> 00:21:12,890
He's already planning for winter break lectures in Pyeongchon and Junjeon.

260
00:21:19,210 --> 00:21:23,540
 This is Seo Hye Jin. Would I be able to see you? 

261
00:21:23,540 --> 00:21:26,630
Don't offer Mr. Lee a dinner more than once.

262
00:21:26,630 --> 00:21:30,690
If he doesn't know I'm a hard person to meet,

263
00:21:30,690 --> 00:21:33,600
that proves that's his limit.

264
00:21:53,930 --> 00:21:55,840
Why are you staring at me?

265
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:57,760
Aren't you worried?

266
00:21:59,110 --> 00:22:00,620
Not really.

267
00:22:01,510 --> 00:22:04,260
This seems like a serious matter.

268
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:08,130
I don't think Ms. Seo would be defeated.

269
00:22:08,830 --> 00:22:11,910
You think this is about winning or losing?

270
00:22:11,910 --> 00:22:14,050
He's just starting a fight childishly.

271
00:22:14,050 --> 00:22:16,240
I guess he wanted to spook her,

272
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:19,250
but it won't work on her at all.

273
00:22:22,380 --> 00:22:25,750
Remember my friend you met last time? The grad student.

274
00:22:25,750 --> 00:22:28,770
He's asking for your number. Can I give it to him?

275
00:22:28,770 --> 00:22:33,300
No. Don't give away my number unless it's a student or parent.

276
00:22:33,300 --> 00:22:34,980
Got it.

277
00:22:54,840 --> 00:22:57,790
 The Academy 

278
00:23:04,250 --> 00:23:06,870
Don't be like that, Ms. Lee.

279
00:23:06,870 --> 00:23:08,850
You don't have to do that.

280
00:23:10,590 --> 00:23:14,780
You're making me feel so bad by quitting like this.

281
00:23:15,480 --> 00:23:17,470
I'm sorry.

282
00:23:18,330 --> 00:23:21,320
Since so many students got a perfect score on multiple-choice questions,

283
00:23:21,320 --> 00:23:23,600
I lost my mind.

284
00:23:25,710 --> 00:23:28,900
I really shouldn't have said that.

285
00:23:28,900 --> 00:23:33,740
You went through a lot because of me, Ms. Lee.

286
00:23:33,740 --> 00:23:36,110
Mr. Pyo.

287
00:23:37,010 --> 00:23:40,520
The students like you a lot.

288
00:23:41,590 --> 00:23:43,760
I hope you study hard

289
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:48,440
and pass the teacher certification exam.

290
00:23:49,730 --> 00:23:55,370
The head of the 10th grade and the principal scolded me, too.

291
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:04,510
There isn't much I can do about that.

292
00:24:04,510 --> 00:24:07,540
No, that's not what I meant.

293
00:24:08,450 --> 00:24:13,950
Anyway, starting next semester, I won't complain at all

294
00:24:13,950 --> 00:24:17,070
no matter how you decide to teach.

295
00:24:21,020 --> 00:24:22,830
Why did you...

296
00:24:23,910 --> 00:24:26,970
want to become a teacher?

297
00:24:32,650 --> 00:24:36,130
Why are you suddenly asking that?

298
00:24:36,130 --> 00:24:38,000
No matter what the reason was,

299
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:43,200
don't ever forget your initial spirit, determination, goals,

300
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:47,050
and always keep them with you.

301
00:24:47,050 --> 00:24:49,270
Mr. Pyo!

302
00:24:49,270 --> 00:24:51,370
I'll leave now.

303
00:25:08,120 --> 00:25:11,150
 The call is not going through. You'll be connected to... 

304
00:25:20,030 --> 00:25:21,660
But why?

305
00:25:21,660 --> 00:25:24,370
It's just a phone number.

306
00:25:24,370 --> 00:25:29,800
Hey, anyway, did you tell her why I wanted to meet her?

307
00:25:30,850 --> 00:25:33,970
I have a lot to say about the liberal arts education in Korea.

308
00:25:33,970 --> 00:25:39,140
I don't know. I don't think she's interested in you at all.

309
00:25:39,140 --> 00:25:43,390
As a human, scholar, or man.

310
00:25:44,210 --> 00:25:46,270
Anyway, I'm busy. I have a class soon.

311
00:25:46,270 --> 00:25:48,200
Let's talk later.

312
00:25:48,200 --> 00:25:50,420
And text me in advance if you're sleeping over.

313
00:25:50,420 --> 00:25:53,010
Otherwise, I'll change the passcode.

314
00:25:53,840 --> 00:25:56,840
Hey, Lee Jun Ho. Lee—

315
00:25:57,420 --> 00:25:59,020
Shit.

316
00:26:03,930 --> 00:26:05,820
Hyeong!

317
00:26:05,820 --> 00:26:08,610
Hey, Kim. What brings you here?

318
00:26:08,610 --> 00:26:10,490
I submitted a request for leave of absence.

319
00:26:10,490 --> 00:26:13,170
The professor wanted to see me for a second.

320
00:26:13,170 --> 00:26:14,590
You're joining the army, aren't you?

321
00:26:14,590 --> 00:26:16,390
- No.
 - What is it, then?

322
00:26:16,390 --> 00:26:18,440
I'll retake the entrance exam.

323
00:26:21,080 --> 00:26:22,920
Going for med school?

324
00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:29,370
I'm glad you're doing that.

325
00:26:29,370 --> 00:26:30,630
Should we get a coffee?

326
00:26:30,630 --> 00:26:32,280
Sounds good.

327
00:26:34,170 --> 00:26:36,240
Were you very shocked?

328
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:38,280
Yes, a little.

329
00:26:41,340 --> 00:26:44,050
I actually found it interesting.

330
00:26:45,880 --> 00:26:50,040
What should be our strategy this time? It's exciting.

331
00:26:50,040 --> 00:26:54,690
The offense doesn't seem that strong, but I don't let my guard down, either.

332
00:26:56,910 --> 00:26:58,960
What did you say?

333
00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:00,640
The teacher from earlier.

334
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:04,050
Choeseon Korean must think of him as a wild card,

335
00:27:04,050 --> 00:27:06,060
but I'm sure he's not that great.

336
00:27:07,380 --> 00:27:09,500
Do you not know?

337
00:27:09,500 --> 00:27:11,150
Know what?

338
00:27:11,150 --> 00:27:12,900
Well...

339
00:27:15,850 --> 00:27:19,790
There was a bit of an issue last midterm.

340
00:27:19,790 --> 00:27:23,300
When you started a fight asking for a redo, you mean?

341
00:27:24,190 --> 00:27:25,550
You knew.

342
00:27:25,550 --> 00:27:27,580
Manager Kim told me.

343
00:27:27,580 --> 00:27:30,200
I expected nothing less from you.

344
00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:33,100
Are you sure you heard everything?

345
00:27:33,100 --> 00:27:35,570
Can you still say that after hearing everything?

346
00:27:36,470 --> 00:27:40,450
He ended up quitting his job because of that.

347
00:27:41,580 --> 00:27:47,240
I don't think it's directly related, but if that were true,

348
00:27:47,240 --> 00:27:51,580
shouldn't he be making a deep bow toward you?

349
00:27:51,580 --> 00:27:54,210
It looked like he taught for at least 20 years.

350
00:27:54,210 --> 00:27:57,090
You don't often get a chance like that at his age.

351
00:27:57,090 --> 00:28:00,500
He used to have his own philosophy and values.

352
00:28:00,500 --> 00:28:05,510
He was proud that he chose to be a teacher when he was in high school.

353
00:28:12,820 --> 00:28:16,210
I've been curious about this since I came here.

354
00:28:16,970 --> 00:28:19,910
Why do you discount your profession so much?

355
00:28:19,910 --> 00:28:22,000
No, no. It's not that.

356
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,390
The students who gave up on school grades

357
00:28:24,390 --> 00:28:28,840
don't hesitate to quit school and apply to colleges immediately.

358
00:28:28,840 --> 00:28:32,350
What great things do school teachers teach?

359
00:28:32,350 --> 00:28:35,140
Why do you talk as if they deserve to be proud

360
00:28:35,140 --> 00:28:38,250
and we have no value at all?

361
00:28:38,250 --> 00:28:41,340
He's been a schoolteacher for a long time. He's old, too.

362
00:28:41,340 --> 00:28:44,320
How could someone like him last at the academy?

363
00:28:44,320 --> 00:28:46,730
Are you looking down on schools, then?

364
00:28:46,730 --> 00:28:50,950
Is it an organization you can last in only if you have faith and pride?

365
00:28:52,950 --> 00:28:55,330
It doesn't matter where you teach.

366
00:28:55,330 --> 00:28:58,100
Isn't it all about who sends more students to good universities?

367
00:28:58,100 --> 00:29:00,150
Let's stop.

368
00:29:00,150 --> 00:29:02,090
Ms. Seo,

369
00:29:02,090 --> 00:29:06,650
stop feeling guilty for no reason and have a relaxing class.

370
00:29:08,910 --> 00:29:11,000
Come to my place after you get off, okay?

371
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:14,060
No, it's okay. You don't understand.

372
00:29:25,230 --> 00:29:26,270
What?

373
00:29:26,270 --> 00:29:32,760
Choeseon Korean was known for hiring a lot of school teachers in the area.

374
00:29:32,760 --> 00:29:36,970
But this is kind of an unusual case.

375
00:29:36,970 --> 00:29:41,560
Team Leader Choi took a peek, apparently.

376
00:29:41,560 --> 00:29:45,770
She said he dressed nicely and looked normal.

377
00:29:45,770 --> 00:29:50,860
But I don't think the students would like him.

378
00:29:50,860 --> 00:29:56,420
He's an old male teacher whom students and mothers avoid.

379
00:29:56,420 --> 00:30:01,430
He also caused a lot of controversy in Chanyeong.

380
00:30:03,780 --> 00:30:08,870
The Gray Witch knows exactly what she's doing.

381
00:30:48,790 --> 00:30:51,940
Hey, Yeon Ju.

382
00:30:51,940 --> 00:30:54,530
It's been a while. Have you been well?

383
00:30:54,530 --> 00:30:57,530
You know, I'm always the same.

384
00:30:57,530 --> 00:31:00,100
How's the baby? Is he doing well?

385
00:31:02,460 --> 00:31:06,900
He must be cute, but you should come back before you lose your touch.

386
00:31:07,720 --> 00:31:12,240
Yes, the thing is...

387
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:14,880
I'd like you to get me a phone number.

388
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:16,940
Please keep it a secret.

389
00:32:13,910 --> 00:32:19,010
He addressed it formally since it's his mother's back. Okay?

390
00:32:19,010 --> 00:32:21,810
That's it for today.

391
00:32:23,400 --> 00:32:27,730
It's starting to kick in, seeing many empty seats, right?

392
00:32:27,730 --> 00:32:30,580
Let's applaud ourselves for working hard.

393
00:32:33,160 --> 00:32:36,460
You all signed up for my winter break class, right?

394
00:32:36,460 --> 00:32:38,010
 Yes. 

395
00:32:38,010 --> 00:32:42,940
Raise your hand if you're planning to take the classical poetry class.

396
00:32:44,870 --> 00:32:47,310
Try taking Ms. Nam's class.

397
00:32:47,310 --> 00:32:48,960
Who's Ms. Nam?

398
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:51,300
The new teacher. I heard about her, too.

399
00:32:51,300 --> 00:32:56,330
You haven't heard her rapping "Song of Gwandong Province," right?

400
00:32:56,330 --> 00:32:58,640
Learn how to do it and teach me, too.

401
00:32:58,640 --> 00:33:00,150
 Okay. 

402
00:33:00,150 --> 00:33:03,780
Okay, enjoy the winter break ceremony. See you at the special lecture.

403
00:33:03,780 --> 00:33:07,070
Ms. Seo, is Sang Seop—

404
00:33:07,620 --> 00:33:10,520
Is Mr. Pyo joining this academy?

405
00:33:10,520 --> 00:33:11,890
Why?

406
00:33:11,890 --> 00:33:14,910
I saw him here earlier today.

407
00:33:14,910 --> 00:33:17,620
He stopped by regarding something else. Why?

408
00:33:17,620 --> 00:33:20,950
His lectures are pretty good.

409
00:33:20,950 --> 00:33:23,710
He's not as fun as you,

410
00:33:23,710 --> 00:33:26,200
but his after-school class was nice.

411
00:33:26,200 --> 00:33:28,840
- Right?
 - Yes.

412
00:33:28,840 --> 00:33:31,470
Ha Yul kept a reading note, too.

413
00:33:31,470 --> 00:33:33,330
Stop.

414
00:33:33,330 --> 00:33:35,890
Wow, I'm about to get jealous.

415
00:33:35,890 --> 00:33:39,680
Come on. We still love you.

416
00:34:12,760 --> 00:34:15,840
Why aren't you here? I'm waiting at the station.

417
00:34:16,650 --> 00:34:19,090
I don't want to see you today. Just leave.

418
00:34:19,090 --> 00:34:21,810
Wait, you can't do that.

419
00:34:21,810 --> 00:34:23,980
We need to talk it out if we have a disagreement.

420
00:34:23,980 --> 00:34:26,140
We need to have an honest debate—

421
00:34:26,140 --> 00:34:27,710
Hello?

422
00:34:32,400 --> 00:34:36,800
- What? 
 - I'll go to your place if you answer my call like that.

423
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:38,450
Where are you?

424
00:34:41,310 --> 00:34:43,130
I'm on my way home.

425
00:34:43,130 --> 00:34:45,030
I've been thinking.

426
00:34:45,030 --> 00:34:48,330
If she refuses to give me her number,

427
00:34:48,330 --> 00:34:51,890
we can just get together casually like last time.

428
00:34:51,890 --> 00:34:54,450
I really need to tell her something, okay?

429
00:34:54,450 --> 00:34:55,820
Hey...

430
00:34:58,380 --> 00:34:59,870
What?

431
00:35:01,810 --> 00:35:03,530
Wow.

432
00:35:07,120 --> 00:35:11,480
Shouldn't this happen between a man and a woman?

433
00:35:11,480 --> 00:35:13,470
You're telling me.

434
00:35:33,710 --> 00:35:36,850
- Should we get dinner?
 - Is it your treat?

435
00:35:36,850 --> 00:35:38,610
Again?

436
00:35:55,140 --> 00:35:56,740
 This is Seo Hye Jin. 

437
00:35:56,740 --> 00:36:00,700
 I'm in front of the academy. Please meet me briefly. 

438
00:36:00,700 --> 00:36:02,750
 I beg you. 

439
00:36:10,510 --> 00:36:16,120
 Daechi Choeseon Korean 

440
00:36:20,980 --> 00:36:24,170
- Thank you, sir. 
- Take care.

441
00:36:28,860 --> 00:36:30,500
What are you doing here?

442
00:36:30,500 --> 00:36:33,950
I had noodles since I got hungry after class.

443
00:36:33,950 --> 00:36:36,620
- Hello. 
- Hello.

444
00:36:37,450 --> 00:36:40,210
Where's the Team Leader? I thought you got off work together.

445
00:36:40,210 --> 00:36:43,250
Well, there's a bit of a situation.

446
00:36:44,250 --> 00:36:46,680
Okay, then. Enjoy your meal.

447
00:36:46,680 --> 00:36:48,830
Okay, see you.

448
00:36:50,650 --> 00:36:51,970
Hello.

449
00:36:51,970 --> 00:36:53,320
Hey, bring her back.

450
00:36:53,320 --> 00:36:55,850
- What?
 - Ask her to join us.

451
00:36:59,550 --> 00:37:01,280
Teacher.

452
00:37:01,280 --> 00:37:02,750
Yes?

453
00:37:02,750 --> 00:37:04,640
Join us for a drink if you'd like.

454
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:06,340
- The bus will stop running. 
- Okay.

455
00:37:06,340 --> 00:37:08,020
I...

456
00:37:09,120 --> 00:37:11,630
I'll stay sober and drive you home.

457
00:37:11,630 --> 00:37:12,790
How?

458
00:37:12,790 --> 00:37:15,470
I have my mom's car. My mom's car.

459
00:37:31,570 --> 00:37:33,780
She asked me to bring you upstairs.

460
00:37:41,250 --> 00:37:44,080
Is Mr. Pyo—

461
00:37:44,080 --> 00:37:47,070
It's the assistant director.

462
00:37:47,070 --> 00:37:52,020
When did you first meet the assistant director?

463
00:37:52,020 --> 00:37:55,060
I thought you came to see the director.

464
00:37:55,060 --> 00:37:57,530
Ask her directly.

465
00:37:57,530 --> 00:38:00,190
You don't get to see her easily.

466
00:38:00,190 --> 00:38:04,520
I'd ask her everything if I were you.

467
00:38:04,520 --> 00:38:06,280
Okay.

468
00:38:09,140 --> 00:38:10,740
Well,

469
00:38:11,540 --> 00:38:15,340
is Lee Si Wu doing well?

470
00:38:15,340 --> 00:38:17,500
Yes. Of course.

471
00:38:20,120 --> 00:38:23,940
He's a difficult kid. He's cheeky, too.

472
00:38:26,550 --> 00:38:28,350
I see.

473
00:38:33,660 --> 00:38:35,440
Yes.

474
00:38:43,770 --> 00:38:46,300
Just one second.

475
00:39:16,980 --> 00:39:18,970
I'm so sorry.

476
00:39:18,970 --> 00:39:22,150
There are so many things to take care of before the break.

477
00:39:22,150 --> 00:39:24,090
Did I make you wait a long time?

478
00:39:24,090 --> 00:39:26,570
Yes, a little.

479
00:39:26,570 --> 00:39:28,440
Have a seat.

480
00:39:29,470 --> 00:39:33,870
I'm sorry, Mr. Park. It got very late.

481
00:39:33,870 --> 00:39:36,480
Might as well wait a little longer.

482
00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:39,360
It won't take too long.

483
00:39:46,390 --> 00:39:51,340
Do we still have more to talk about?

484
00:39:52,140 --> 00:39:55,780
The empty room you showed me last time...

485
00:39:55,780 --> 00:39:57,700
The assistant director's office?

486
00:39:58,380 --> 00:40:01,300
Would it be too late for me to take it now?

487
00:40:02,100 --> 00:40:03,780
What a shame.

488
00:40:03,780 --> 00:40:06,730
We found someone a few days ago.

489
00:40:08,040 --> 00:40:11,840
You found the right person very quickly.

490
00:40:11,840 --> 00:40:16,990
He's not as good as you, but I'm pretty satisfied.

491
00:40:21,970 --> 00:40:26,430
I think you already met the person.

492
00:40:27,720 --> 00:40:32,010
It's too late to beat around the bushes.

493
00:40:32,010 --> 00:40:35,210
I'd like to know why. Why out of all people—

494
00:40:35,210 --> 00:40:40,800
That's a rude question for either the assistant director or me.

495
00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:44,400
There are no other reasons but for his merit.

496
00:40:46,540 --> 00:40:48,950
He belongs at school.

497
00:40:51,970 --> 00:40:58,980
I really like this about you, Ms. Seo.

498
00:40:59,610 --> 00:41:04,140
When it came to your business, you acted like a scoundrel...

499
00:41:04,140 --> 00:41:06,020
Pardon me.

500
00:41:06,020 --> 00:41:09,940
Like a warrior, you swung your sword around.

501
00:41:09,940 --> 00:41:15,070
But you suddenly speak of ethics after you win the fight.

502
00:41:16,210 --> 00:41:20,950
Not just anyone can be as shameless as that.

503
00:41:22,760 --> 00:41:26,610
I want you so badly.

504
00:41:26,610 --> 00:41:28,230
Last midterm—

505
00:41:28,230 --> 00:41:34,400
You hung Mr. Pyo in the middle of the teachers' office and beat him to a pulp.

506
00:41:34,400 --> 00:41:38,190
In front of his colleagues, even.

507
00:41:38,190 --> 00:41:43,550
And now you're saying he belongs in school.

508
00:41:43,550 --> 00:41:48,030
That's the funniest joke I've heard this year.

509
00:41:50,800 --> 00:41:52,250
You're being rude.

510
00:41:52,250 --> 00:41:54,130
Am I?

511
00:41:55,650 --> 00:41:59,590
You played tricks with the schedule before I started the Huiwon class

512
00:41:59,590 --> 00:42:04,300
and displayed an ad mocking me in the middle of Daechi-dong.

513
00:42:04,300 --> 00:42:09,440
And what did you say when you rejected my offer?

514
00:42:09,440 --> 00:42:11,780
 I wanted to tell you that 

515
00:42:11,780 --> 00:42:17,380
my decision has nothing to do with the contract terms.

516
00:42:25,750 --> 00:42:28,670
I'll stay at my current workplace.

517
00:42:36,700 --> 00:42:40,640
Can you tell me the real reason?

518
00:42:40,640 --> 00:42:44,190
I need to teach Si Wu.

519
00:42:45,310 --> 00:42:47,270
He's an excellent student.

520
00:42:47,270 --> 00:42:50,280
He'll probably follow you if you come here.

521
00:42:50,280 --> 00:42:55,000
He decided to switch by giving up the scholarship benefits.

522
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:58,150
I can't tell him to come back here after that.

523
00:42:58,150 --> 00:43:02,250
He'll get the same benefits if he comes back.

524
00:43:02,250 --> 00:43:04,090
If he wants to,

525
00:43:05,190 --> 00:43:09,760
I'll let him take your class, not mine.

526
00:43:12,130 --> 00:43:16,300
It was just about switching academies, but to a young student,

527
00:43:16,300 --> 00:43:20,900
it must've been a difficult decision that required courage.

528
00:43:20,900 --> 00:43:24,040
I can't bring myself to...

529
00:43:25,240 --> 00:43:26,950
disregard that decision.

530
00:43:26,950 --> 00:43:28,350
 I thought I was... 

531
00:43:28,350 --> 00:43:32,220
watching the teacher from "Dead Poets Society."

532
00:43:32,220 --> 00:43:35,860
Was his name Keating or Keaton?

533
00:43:35,860 --> 00:43:38,860
I'm asking why you hired Mr. Pyo.

534
00:43:38,860 --> 00:43:40,360
Why should I...

535
00:43:41,020 --> 00:43:42,300
endure such a mockery—

536
00:43:42,300 --> 00:43:44,200
Don't consider it a mockery.

537
00:43:44,200 --> 00:43:49,780
I've said it before, but I like that about you.

538
00:43:50,870 --> 00:43:54,280
We're teachers but also salespeople.

539
00:43:54,280 --> 00:44:01,390
Not everyone can ignore the conflict between the two as cleanly as you.

540
00:44:04,180 --> 00:44:06,610
Mr. Pyo...

541
00:44:08,260 --> 00:44:10,190
can't become...

542
00:44:11,350 --> 00:44:13,630
a scoundrel like me.

543
00:44:13,630 --> 00:44:15,540
Mr. Pyo...

544
00:44:16,610 --> 00:44:19,450
made the decision himself.

545
00:44:19,450 --> 00:44:22,620
All I did was give him the opportunity.

546
00:44:22,620 --> 00:44:28,610
Aren't I much more human than you are?

547
00:44:28,610 --> 00:44:30,090
He's not even young.

548
00:44:30,090 --> 00:44:31,980
He'd become hopeless if he failed here.

549
00:44:31,980 --> 00:44:36,310
Aren't you hoping he'd fail since he might steal your Chanyeong students?

550
00:44:36,310 --> 00:44:38,540
I'm a scoundrel, but I'm not that bad.

551
00:44:38,540 --> 00:44:44,680
Or do you look down on him because you still think of him as a pathetic

552
00:44:44,680 --> 00:44:47,360
teacher who got beaten up by you in the teachers' office?

553
00:44:47,360 --> 00:44:50,430
- Director Choi.
 - If it's neither,

554
00:44:51,010 --> 00:44:54,360
there's only one thing you can do.

555
00:44:56,550 --> 00:45:00,350
Cheer for him. Fighting!

556
00:45:21,820 --> 00:45:24,160
Thank you for your time.

557
00:45:26,240 --> 00:45:29,460
I still like you, Ms. Seo.

558
00:45:30,210 --> 00:45:32,780
That's why I'm telling you this.

559
00:45:32,780 --> 00:45:36,400
You'd have to get nervous a bit.

560
00:45:36,400 --> 00:45:38,960
I'm saying Mr. Pyo, who switched gears

561
00:45:38,960 --> 00:45:42,660
will be a pretty strong opponent.

562
00:45:44,220 --> 00:45:48,600
I, Choi Hyeong Seon, verified him.

563
00:46:09,120 --> 00:46:11,310
 Going down. First floor. 

564
00:46:11,310 --> 00:46:13,410
 The door is closing. 

565
00:46:33,630 --> 00:46:35,330
It's not fair.

566
00:46:37,050 --> 00:46:39,020
She said, "I don't want to see you."

567
00:46:39,020 --> 00:46:41,130
How could she say that?

568
00:46:41,870 --> 00:46:43,410
Hey.

569
00:46:43,410 --> 00:46:48,240
To be honest, I'm finally getting used to you dating her.

570
00:46:48,240 --> 00:46:50,920
Do I have to hear about your issues now? How gross.

571
00:46:50,920 --> 00:46:54,200
The one who's more in love has a disadvantage, but

572
00:46:54,200 --> 00:46:56,730
isn't she being too cruel to me?

573
00:46:58,860 --> 00:47:01,360
- Here you go.
 - Thank you.

574
00:47:01,360 --> 00:47:04,660
By the way, did you two fight?

575
00:47:04,660 --> 00:47:08,440
No, I've been attacked by her.

576
00:47:08,440 --> 00:47:12,070
She doesn't normally let it out on someone else.

577
00:47:12,070 --> 00:47:15,680
I know. I'm frustrated because I know that.

578
00:47:17,420 --> 00:47:21,870
I thought it was a secret. Everyone in Daechi-dong seems to know.

579
00:47:31,160 --> 00:47:33,050
What are you thinking about?

580
00:47:34,480 --> 00:47:38,240
I was thinking having a relationship with a younger man isn't good.

581
00:47:38,240 --> 00:47:40,590
- What? Why?
 - Why?

582
00:47:41,710 --> 00:47:44,750
I wasn't like that when I was 29.

583
00:47:44,750 --> 00:47:47,910
Maybe it's not about age.

584
00:47:47,910 --> 00:47:50,140
What do you mean...

585
00:47:52,090 --> 00:47:53,850
What do you mean by that?

586
00:47:55,440 --> 00:48:01,670
It's not that Team Leader Seo doesn't want to see you. She probably can't.

587
00:48:03,720 --> 00:48:06,850
What did Mr. Pyo say, exactly?

588
00:48:07,540 --> 00:48:09,160
I didn't ask her that.

589
00:48:09,160 --> 00:48:12,160
Gosh, you're embarrassing the younger men.

590
00:48:12,940 --> 00:48:14,700
Without even asking that,

591
00:48:14,700 --> 00:48:18,770
you said, "Let's beat Pyo Sang Seob"?

592
00:48:19,690 --> 00:48:23,020
Is there something wrong with that?

593
00:48:23,020 --> 00:48:25,110
She's a very strong person and—

594
00:48:25,110 --> 00:48:26,810
Of course, she is.

595
00:48:26,810 --> 00:48:28,840
But people like that get hurt, too.

596
00:48:28,840 --> 00:48:30,470
What do you mean hurt?

597
00:48:30,470 --> 00:48:33,000
His attack couldn't have been that strong.

598
00:48:33,950 --> 00:48:36,200
The teacher she defeated...

599
00:48:36,200 --> 00:48:38,830
quit his job at school he'd had for 20 years and said

600
00:48:38,830 --> 00:48:41,570
he'd become an academy teacher.

601
00:48:41,570 --> 00:48:45,960
He couldn't have been just warning that he'd take her Chanyeong students.

602
00:48:45,960 --> 00:48:47,850
Of course not.

603
00:48:47,850 --> 00:48:50,630
But her favorite student—

604
00:48:50,630 --> 00:48:52,150
No, no.

605
00:48:52,950 --> 00:48:54,690
I'm her boyfriend.

606
00:48:56,470 --> 00:48:59,570
Wh-What? Why are you looking at me like that?

607
00:48:59,570 --> 00:49:02,360
I feel sorry for Team Leader Seo.

608
00:49:04,630 --> 00:49:06,790
You're screwed, you bastard.

609
00:49:06,790 --> 00:49:08,310
What do you mean, I'm screwed?

610
00:49:08,310 --> 00:49:11,430
You should be glad Seo Hye Jin is a hardworking person.

611
00:49:11,430 --> 00:49:13,310
If not, you'd be dumped already.

612
00:49:13,310 --> 00:49:16,390
I told you not to call her by her name, didn't I?

613
00:49:16,390 --> 00:49:21,800
She needs to stay your first love and a teacher who changed your life, too.

614
00:49:22,690 --> 00:49:25,520
She's already bleeding everywhere,

615
00:49:25,520 --> 00:49:29,260
but she needs to behead the enemy on the battlefield, too.

616
00:49:29,260 --> 00:49:31,190
What else did you say?

617
00:49:32,770 --> 00:49:36,790
She needs to have an honest discussion since you're whining.

618
00:49:36,790 --> 00:49:39,900
You think she's a Buddhist monk or something?

619
00:49:46,410 --> 00:49:49,960
Ms. Nam, I'm sorry, but may I leave now?

620
00:49:49,960 --> 00:49:51,730
Pay for the drinks before you go.

621
00:49:51,730 --> 00:49:53,160
I'll pay. You can go.

622
00:49:53,160 --> 00:49:56,270
No, I need to pay you for the lesson. Thank you.

623
00:49:56,270 --> 00:49:58,580
You'd better be nice to Ms. Nam.

624
00:49:58,580 --> 00:50:01,220
Don't worry, and be gone quickly.

625
00:50:11,450 --> 00:50:13,750
- Bye.
 - Bye.

626
00:50:36,110 --> 00:50:38,750
Hey, So Yeong.

627
00:50:38,750 --> 00:50:41,600
Yes, I'm going home now.

628
00:50:41,600 --> 00:50:43,710
Yes, I was a bit busy today.

629
00:50:43,710 --> 00:50:45,840
I heard you guys fought.

630
00:50:46,640 --> 00:50:50,370
How do I know? I have an informant here.

631
00:50:51,020 --> 00:50:54,630
Do you want to come here if you aren't too far away?

632
00:50:54,630 --> 00:50:58,240
I want to hear about your relationship troubles.

633
00:50:58,240 --> 00:51:01,120
What's going on, anyway?

634
00:51:01,120 --> 00:51:03,910
It's not like that.

635
00:51:03,910 --> 00:51:06,150
I have...

636
00:51:06,150 --> 00:51:09,490
a bit of a headache about something.

637
00:51:09,490 --> 00:51:13,180
Yes. By the way, So Yeong,

638
00:51:13,180 --> 00:51:16,510
I went through a lot today.

639
00:51:16,510 --> 00:51:17,940
Yes.

640
00:51:17,940 --> 00:51:19,840
Okay.

641
00:51:19,840 --> 00:51:22,560
Let's have the year-end party next time.

642
00:51:22,560 --> 00:51:25,690
Stop bringing up Jun Ho.

643
00:51:25,690 --> 00:51:29,850
I miss him so much already.

644
00:51:33,490 --> 00:51:36,040
Okay, then.

645
00:51:36,040 --> 00:51:39,020
Yes, I know you're always busy.

646
00:51:39,020 --> 00:51:41,960
Yes. Okay, then.

647
00:51:41,960 --> 00:51:45,790
Drive safely. Bye.

648
00:51:51,100 --> 00:51:53,540
She said she was dying to see him.

649
00:51:53,540 --> 00:51:55,560
No, no, no.

650
00:51:55,560 --> 00:51:56,620
What? What is it?

651
00:51:56,620 --> 00:51:59,550
I don't think this is just a lovers' quarrel.

652
00:51:59,550 --> 00:52:00,880
What?

653
00:52:01,670 --> 00:52:04,460
Earlier, Mr. Lee and

654
00:52:04,460 --> 00:52:06,990
that person came together.

655
00:52:06,990 --> 00:52:11,240
Just drop me off in Donam-dong.

656
00:52:11,240 --> 00:52:14,340
Huh? Do you live there?

657
00:52:14,340 --> 00:52:16,850
I thought it was further north.

658
00:52:16,850 --> 00:52:21,310
It's cheaper to get a taxi from there. There are lots of taxis there.

659
00:52:22,650 --> 00:52:26,440
Just let me drive you to your neighborhood.

660
00:52:26,440 --> 00:52:29,040
It'd be hard to get a cab because it's the holiday season.

661
00:52:29,040 --> 00:52:33,250
I can't let a stranger know where I live in this day and age.

662
00:52:35,460 --> 00:52:39,140
How many levels of verification do you need?

663
00:52:39,140 --> 00:52:42,470
I'm Lee Jun Ho's friend, Seo Hye Jin's student,

664
00:52:42,470 --> 00:52:44,660
and Kim Hyo Im's son.

665
00:52:51,320 --> 00:52:55,720
What are you best at teaching?

666
00:52:55,720 --> 00:52:59,800
Out of literature, essay, and grammar.

667
00:52:59,800 --> 00:53:02,910
My specialty is classical poetry.

668
00:53:02,910 --> 00:53:05,010
I like how fun it is.

669
00:53:07,370 --> 00:53:10,250
I enjoy studying, too.

670
00:53:10,250 --> 00:53:12,050
Wow.

671
00:53:12,050 --> 00:53:15,130
Why? Are you surprised?

672
00:53:15,130 --> 00:53:17,090
Yes.

673
00:53:17,090 --> 00:53:20,910
You studied history because your grades weren't good enough

674
00:53:20,910 --> 00:53:23,450
and went to grad school because you couldn't get a job.

675
00:53:23,450 --> 00:53:29,110
Saying that lets me avoid a ton of questions.

676
00:53:29,110 --> 00:53:33,300
But I enjoy studying.

677
00:53:34,880 --> 00:53:37,470
My mom would be shocked to hear that.

678
00:53:37,470 --> 00:53:42,940
She'd say, "Why couldn't you go to a better school, then?"

679
00:55:03,220 --> 00:55:04,650
 Where are you? 

680
00:55:04,650 --> 00:55:07,600
 I'm worried because I don't see your car in the parking lot. 

681
00:55:08,300 --> 00:55:10,850
 I understand you don't want to see me, 

682
00:55:10,850 --> 00:55:13,410
 but I still want to be with you. 

683
00:55:26,380 --> 00:55:28,920
 You won't even hear me breathing. 

684
00:55:28,920 --> 00:55:31,190
 I'll just be by your side. 

685
00:55:40,150 --> 00:55:42,940
- Would you like a receipt? 
- It's okay.

686
00:55:42,940 --> 00:55:45,220
- Thank you.
- Thanks for the meal.

687
00:55:45,220 --> 00:55:47,610
Thanks for the meal.

688
00:55:47,610 --> 00:55:50,700
- Thank you!
 - Thank you for coming.

689
00:55:51,290 --> 00:55:54,350
I'll clean up quickly. Wait a moment.

690
00:55:55,040 --> 00:55:56,750
I wonder how it feels.

691
00:55:56,750 --> 00:55:58,650
Huh? What do you mean?

692
00:55:59,650 --> 00:56:02,380
There's a side of me I completely loathe.

693
00:56:02,380 --> 00:56:05,100
I've been ignoring it all this time.

694
00:56:05,100 --> 00:56:06,950
But one day,

695
00:56:06,950 --> 00:56:12,010
I saw that side of me in someone I love.

696
00:56:12,010 --> 00:56:14,700
It happened so casually.

697
00:56:16,150 --> 00:56:19,010
Wow, that's...

698
00:56:19,810 --> 00:56:21,990
a little scary.

699
00:56:23,800 --> 00:56:25,900
 Watch from a distance. 

700
00:56:27,790 --> 00:56:29,990
 Because I'm scared. 

701
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:33,600
When did I say I found Mr. Lee kind of strange?

702
00:56:33,600 --> 00:56:36,780
The day Hye Jin's event failed?

703
00:56:36,780 --> 00:56:39,360
Right, it was then.

704
00:56:39,360 --> 00:56:41,400
I think I said

705
00:56:41,400 --> 00:56:45,240
Mr. Lee resembles Hye Jin a lot in a way,

706
00:56:45,240 --> 00:56:49,250
but that seems to provoke her.

707
00:56:51,050 --> 00:56:54,210
I thought it was just a sign

708
00:56:54,210 --> 00:56:58,290
that they were starting to flirt.

709
00:57:00,820 --> 00:57:03,720
But I guess that wasn't everything.

What are you doing here? Why aren't you home?

716
00:57:46,550 --> 00:57:48,280
Get in. Let's go somewhere.

By calling you my first love and mentor,

723
00:58:11,940 --> 00:58:14,210
I made you feel scared.

724
00:58:15,480 --> 00:58:17,750
I said I loved you,

725
00:58:17,750 --> 00:58:21,940
but I only focused on what I wanted to see. I'm sorry.

728
00:58:28,210 --> 00:58:29,690
A little.

729
00:58:32,300 --> 00:58:34,090
Put the belt on.

♫  Oh the greatness I foresee  ♫

732
00:58:45,490 --> 00:58:47,950
I went to Choeseon Korean.

733
00:58:50,550 --> 00:58:53,630
I could tell why Director Choi is the best.

734
00:58:54,630 --> 00:58:59,310
She summarized what kind of person I am so clearly.

735
00:59:00,820 --> 00:59:03,110
I'll never forget it.

736
00:59:04,600 --> 00:59:06,240
What did she say?

737
00:59:07,090 --> 00:59:09,540
She said I'm a scoundrel.

738
00:59:12,010 --> 00:59:14,310
Is she out of her mind?

739
00:59:15,470 --> 00:59:18,080
Wow, seriously...

740
00:59:19,770 --> 00:59:21,670
Forget nonsense like that.

741
00:59:22,480 --> 00:59:25,220
She said I act like a scoundrel when I fight,

742
00:59:25,220 --> 00:59:28,380
but I speak of ethics after I win.

743
00:59:28,380 --> 00:59:31,720
She told me how despicable,

744
00:59:31,720 --> 00:59:35,440
selfish, and calculating I am

745
00:59:35,440 --> 00:59:38,490
in a very clear way.

746
00:59:38,490 --> 00:59:41,940
She must've chosen the words to hurt you the most.

747
00:59:41,940 --> 00:59:43,710
Why did you have to go there, anyway?

748
00:59:43,710 --> 00:59:45,380
- What could change— 
- Don't get worked up.

749
00:59:45,380 --> 00:59:48,000
We're on our way to talk about that now.

750
00:59:50,170 --> 00:59:54,100
I walked this path feeling so proud.

751
00:59:55,610 --> 00:59:58,280
Your students' grades were at stake.

752
00:59:58,280 --> 01:00:00,310
I did it for myself.

753
01:00:01,140 --> 01:00:03,300
 Did he say the answer is No. 5? 

754
01:00:03,300 --> 01:00:08,070
I thought, "The teacher will be stubborn.

755
01:00:08,070 --> 01:00:11,670
I should cause trouble properly, then.

756
01:00:11,670 --> 01:00:16,110
This is my chance to let my name known without spending a penny."

757
01:00:17,380 --> 01:00:20,760
I was happy at first. My class actually grew.

758
01:00:22,270 --> 01:00:26,310
I started thinking I might've done something wrong

759
01:00:26,310 --> 01:00:29,710
when Mr. Pyo said the exam would be completely based on the textbook.

760
01:00:29,710 --> 01:00:35,570
That's when I realized he'd be in trouble at school.

761
01:00:35,570 --> 01:00:38,160
But I didn't care. Of course not.

762
01:00:38,160 --> 01:00:42,140
I became even more dogged, so I didn't lose the students.

763
01:00:43,930 --> 01:00:46,350
- Was that when— 
- Yes.

764
01:00:46,350 --> 01:00:49,180
When you were insisting on joining the academy.

765
01:00:49,180 --> 01:00:53,950
I quit trying to make you give up because of that, too.

766
01:00:55,320 --> 01:00:58,710
I owe everything to Mr. Pyo, then.

767
01:00:58,710 --> 01:01:00,320
No, don't say that.

768
01:01:00,320 --> 01:01:02,510
When I think about

769
01:01:02,510 --> 01:01:05,890
what he must've gone through while I was hanging with you,

770
01:01:06,780 --> 01:01:08,940
it breaks my heart.

771
01:01:23,950 --> 01:01:26,170
Why did we come here, by the way?

772
01:01:26,890 --> 01:01:31,140
I was wondering if I could even attempt to understand

773
01:01:32,550 --> 01:01:37,450
how heavy his steps must've been walking this path every morning.

774
01:01:38,860 --> 01:01:42,170
It must've been so hard to walk past the gate.

775
01:01:43,170 --> 01:01:45,050
Do you think I'm taking it too far?

776
01:01:46,390 --> 01:01:47,960
A little.

777
01:01:49,790 --> 01:01:52,420
The most guilty person is the Gray Witch.

778
01:01:52,420 --> 01:01:55,120
I wanted to think so, too.

779
01:01:55,120 --> 01:01:58,000
I was already in front of Choeseon Korean when I came to my senses.

780
01:01:59,420 --> 01:02:02,620
"You're the one who dragged Mr. Pyo out of school."

781
01:02:04,460 --> 01:02:06,760
I guess I wanted to blame her like that.

782
01:02:08,760 --> 01:02:11,130
Although I ended up this way.

783
01:02:12,470 --> 01:02:14,150
So?

784
01:02:22,920 --> 01:02:25,470
I want to go back in time.

785
01:02:27,120 --> 01:02:29,060
That's impossible.

786
01:02:29,060 --> 01:02:30,550
I know.

787
01:02:30,550 --> 01:02:34,710
At least, I need to give back what I earned through Mr. Pyo, don't I?

788
01:02:34,710 --> 01:02:36,870
That's impossible, too.

789
01:02:38,140 --> 01:02:40,760
Do you want to share your students with him or something?

790
01:02:42,640 --> 01:02:44,720
If you make the academy lose even a penny,

791
01:02:44,720 --> 01:02:48,190
the director and assistant director won't just sit back this time.

792
01:02:49,430 --> 01:02:52,770
Think about what they did when the free lecture failed.

793
01:03:01,260 --> 01:03:03,130
Let's go to my place.

794
01:03:04,570 --> 01:03:08,290
I'm not that much of an animal. I won't lay a finger on you.

795
01:03:10,020 --> 01:03:11,910
Please understand that...

796
01:03:12,950 --> 01:03:16,450
I don't want to leave you alone on a day like this.

797
01:03:25,440 --> 01:03:27,920
All of my clothes would be too big.

798
01:03:27,920 --> 01:03:29,910
What do I do?

799
01:03:45,500 --> 01:03:50,510
♫  I can remember when   ♫

800
01:03:50,510 --> 01:03:55,600
♫  I was a child  ♫

801
01:03:55,600 --> 01:04:00,680
♫  And things were simple then  ♫

802
01:04:00,680 --> 01:04:05,870
♫  And I ran wild  ♫

803
01:04:05,870 --> 01:04:10,960
♫  Can you remember when   ♫

804
01:04:10,960 --> 01:04:15,940
♫  We first met eyes   ♫

805
01:04:15,940 --> 01:04:21,150
♫  It seemed that time did bend  ♫

806
01:04:21,150 --> 01:04:26,270
♫  And things were simple then  ♫

807
01:04:26,270 --> 01:04:32,510
♫  And since they've always been  ♫

808
01:04:32,510 --> 01:04:36,710
♫  Since I've loved you  ♫

809
01:04:37,660 --> 01:04:41,260
♫  Standing here all alone  ♫

810
01:04:41,260 --> 01:04:45,180
Does listening to stuff like this help you sleep?

811
01:04:45,880 --> 01:04:48,320
That's what people say.

812
01:04:48,320 --> 01:04:51,660
Although I can sleep just fine without stuff like this.

813
01:04:52,450 --> 01:04:56,490
♫  ...they might call a dream  ♫

814
01:04:56,490 --> 01:04:58,910
I don't even remember what the ocean looks like.

815
01:04:58,910 --> 01:05:03,200
♫  But you came after all  ♫

816
01:05:03,200 --> 01:05:07,360
♫  Said look away  ♫

817
01:05:10,190 --> 01:05:12,040
How nice.

818
01:05:13,470 --> 01:05:18,630
♫  Just like they've always been  ♫

819
01:05:18,630 --> 01:05:24,920
♫  Will our love ever end  ♫

820
01:05:26,250 --> 01:05:29,950
♫  I'll never know  ♫

821

 Level 1 is guaranteed - Lee Jun Ho Korean 

822
01:08:01,850 --> 01:08:03,060
Hi, Mom.

823
01:08:03,060 --> 01:08:07,740
Is your passcode different than ours?

824
01:08:07,740 --> 01:08:10,000
What are you talking about?

825
01:08:14,170 --> 01:08:15,650
You're where?

826
01:08:16,890 --> 01:08:18,090
I'll go to the rooftop.

827
01:08:18,090 --> 01:08:21,110
No, it's cold up there. You'll catch a cold.

828
01:08:22,070 --> 01:08:25,840
Over there. There's a space behind the clothes rod.

829
01:08:32,460 --> 01:08:34,180
Be careful.

830
01:08:36,510 --> 01:08:38,310
Stay here for a moment.

831
01:08:38,310 --> 01:08:39,860
Your shoes.

832
01:08:39,860 --> 01:08:41,990
♫  It seems like everybody knows  ♫

833
01:08:41,990 --> 01:08:45,700
♫  So I just try and play along  ♫

834
01:08:46,750 --> 01:08:48,580
Just one moment. I'm so sorry.

835
01:08:48,580 --> 01:08:50,010
 What are you doing? 

836
01:08:50,010 --> 01:08:53,960
Mom, I'll get dressed. Just one second.

837
01:08:53,960 --> 01:08:56,900
♫  The lightning gleams  ♫

838
01:08:56,900 --> 01:09:00,700
♫  What does it mean, what's it gonna be  ♫

839
01:09:00,700 --> 01:09:04,500
♫   If you're gonna forget me  ♫

840
01:09:04,500 --> 01:09:06,600
Mom.

841
01:09:06,600 --> 01:09:08,360
Gosh, be careful.

842
01:09:08,360 --> 01:09:12,370
♫  Can you catch me  ♫

843
01:09:13,450 --> 01:09:15,920
You should've called first.

844
01:09:20,970 --> 01:09:29,980


845
01:09:33,360 --> 01:09:36,010
♫  Chase me down the hall  ♫

846
01:09:36,010 --> 01:09:38,390
♫  Then never answering my call  ♫

847
01:09:38,390 --> 01:09:41,360
♫  Make me feel small  ♫

848
01:09:41,360 --> 01:09:45,360
 The Midnight Romance in Hagwon 

849
01:09:45,360 --> 01:09:47,150
 Is it okay to break your parents' hearts? 

850
01:09:47,150 --> 01:09:49,100
 Why are you upset? Why? 

851
01:09:49,100 --> 01:09:51,420
 I'll do what I'm supposed to do. 

852
01:09:51,420 --> 01:09:53,230
 I thought you wouldn't hang out with me for a while. 

853
01:09:53,230 --> 01:09:56,250
 Are you worried about Team Leader Seo's future now? 

854
01:09:56,250 --> 01:09:58,080
 You aren't upset, are you? 

855
01:09:58,080 --> 01:10:01,580
 Our intentions might be different, but our goals might be the same. 

856
01:10:01,580 --> 01:10:05,220
 You brought Seo Hye Jin's head. 

857
01:10:05,220 --> 01:10:07,070
 Isn't that cheating? 

858
01:10:07,070 --> 01:10:09,720
 I still want to date. Try going out with me. 

859
01:10:09,720 --> 01:10:11,570
 I'll redo the teaching material. 

860
01:10:11,570 --> 01:10:13,840
 It's like you're saying you'd abolish the entrance exam! 

861
01:10:13,840 --> 01:10:15,710
 Lee Jun Ho! 

862
01:10:18,190 --> 01:10:20,030
♫  Can you catch me?  ♫
