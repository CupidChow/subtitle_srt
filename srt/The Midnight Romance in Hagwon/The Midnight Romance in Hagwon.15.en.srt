(Episode 15)

8
00:00:54,090 --> 00:00:55,090
No.

9
00:00:59,929 --> 00:01:01,329
It was nothing serious.

10
00:01:07,999 --> 00:01:09,069
Please sit down.

11
00:01:22,250 --> 00:01:23,250
It's nothing.

12
00:01:28,990 --> 00:01:32,190
Well, you guys had a tough day today.

13
00:01:32,429 --> 00:01:34,759
He must have been a little shaken up.

14
00:01:36,160 --> 00:01:37,600
Enough to make him cry?

15
00:01:38,729 --> 00:01:39,770
Him?

16
00:01:40,270 --> 00:01:41,369
Well...

17
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:43,369
He had nothing to do with it. I...

18
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:45,869
I must have been tired.

19
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:49,410
I have no excuse for what happened recently.

20
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:51,308
If you want to hold anyone responsible, that should be me.

21
00:01:51,309 --> 00:01:52,350
Ms. Seo.

22
00:01:52,809 --> 00:01:53,850
It's nothing like that.

23
00:01:54,819 --> 00:01:56,020
I was just tired. That's all.

24
00:01:57,080 --> 00:01:58,149
You want me to believe that?

25
00:02:00,419 --> 00:02:01,990
I'm asking you to let it slide.

26
00:02:02,690 --> 00:02:05,089
- But you're crying. - Yes, I cried like a baby.

27
00:02:07,530 --> 00:02:08,860
So let's just move on.

28
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:16,039
Did you have dinner?

29
00:02:16,639 --> 00:02:17,669
Yes.

30
00:02:20,870 --> 00:02:21,979
I need to use the restroom.

31
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:29,479
- Excuse me. - Yes.

32
00:02:29,919 --> 00:02:32,150
Could you give us some food?

33
00:02:32,519 --> 00:02:34,859
Something easy to swallow would be nice.

34
00:02:35,019 --> 00:02:36,019
Sure.

35
00:02:38,590 --> 00:02:39,729
By the way,

36
00:02:40,460 --> 00:02:42,160
are there any cigarettes...

37
00:02:42,259 --> 00:02:44,430
other customers left behind? If so, could you spare a few?

38
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:49,470
- Here. - Gosh.

39
00:02:52,009 --> 00:02:53,310
I should have called you.

40
00:02:54,509 --> 00:02:55,609
I made you wait a long time, didn't I?

41
00:02:57,609 --> 00:02:58,949
You did well, getting through today.

42
00:03:01,150 --> 00:03:02,380
Let's have some food first.

43
00:03:02,579 --> 00:03:04,690
I heard you kicked out a student during your class.

44
00:03:10,090 --> 00:03:11,160
Why did you do it?

45
00:03:14,030 --> 00:03:15,259
Because I didn't want to teach him.

46
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:19,799
Don't be emotional.

47
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:23,139
Think about the damage the academy is facing.

48
00:03:23,169 --> 00:03:25,009
Each student is important to us now.

49
00:03:26,910 --> 00:03:29,138
If you kick out all the students who are rude...

50
00:03:29,139 --> 00:03:30,210
Is that...

51
00:03:31,850 --> 00:03:33,650
what you really want...

52
00:03:34,949 --> 00:03:35,979
to talk about now?

53
00:03:38,090 --> 00:03:39,090
Will you answer me...

54
00:03:41,060 --> 00:03:42,690
if I ask you why you're like this?

55
00:03:46,190 --> 00:03:47,190
A lot of students think...

56
00:03:47,191 --> 00:03:49,198
academy instructors are beneath them.

57
00:03:49,199 --> 00:03:50,460
Not that.

58
00:03:52,229 --> 00:03:53,630
Tell me what you really want to say.

59
00:03:55,039 --> 00:03:56,299
Tell me things like...

60
00:03:57,970 --> 00:03:59,238
how today was for you and so on.

61
00:03:59,239 --> 00:04:00,969
I know that we don't have to go along...

62
00:04:00,970 --> 00:04:02,508
with their jokes, ignorance, or mockery, but...

63
00:04:02,509 --> 00:04:04,210
"Today had been a tough day."

64
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:08,279
"It was exhausting." Tell me stuff like that.

65
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:10,119
Being emotional won't help much.

66
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:11,120
"Jun Ho."

67
00:04:13,889 --> 00:04:15,789
"Putting up with the gossip was much harder than I thought."

68
00:04:16,989 --> 00:04:19,329
- Stuff like that. - Call the student tomorrow...

69
00:04:19,430 --> 00:04:20,459
and apologize too.

70
00:04:20,460 --> 00:04:22,030
"The students and the mothers..."

71
00:04:23,929 --> 00:04:25,200
"had no loyalty."

72
00:04:26,299 --> 00:04:27,700
"I felt wronged and disappointed."

73
00:04:28,539 --> 00:04:29,570
Just tell me...

74
00:04:30,039 --> 00:04:31,140
things like this.

75
00:04:32,039 --> 00:04:33,369
Why are you talking to me like this?

76
00:04:35,780 --> 00:04:37,308
You're the one who cried like a baby.

77
00:04:37,309 --> 00:04:38,450
But why are you patronizing me?

78
00:04:45,249 --> 00:04:47,089
The student you kicked out is famous for his attitude.

79
00:04:47,090 --> 00:04:49,059
- His father... - "This is all your fault."

80
00:04:52,729 --> 00:04:54,030
Say that.

81
00:04:59,530 --> 00:05:01,340
- "All day today..." - All day today...

82
00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:03,739
All day today,

83
00:05:06,039 --> 00:05:08,080
I wondered how it would've been if I were never your teacher.

84
00:05:09,510 --> 00:05:10,539
That crossed my mind. So what?

85
00:05:12,850 --> 00:05:15,179
How would it have been if we were around the same age?

86
00:05:15,679 --> 00:05:17,080
That's what I wondered. So what?

87
00:05:21,460 --> 00:05:24,220
The student who had a crush on you. The prettiest girl in your school.

88
00:05:24,689 --> 00:05:26,330
"What if I were her?"

89
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:29,799
"Then people wouldn't have gossiped about us like this."

90
00:05:33,299 --> 00:05:36,400
"How different would it have been if I had a proper job?"

91
00:05:38,340 --> 00:05:41,070
"Then my career wouldn't be ruined for dating someone from the office."

92
00:05:42,809 --> 00:05:43,809
Yes.

93
00:05:46,780 --> 00:05:48,419
I thought this was so messed up.

94
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:54,419
I knew that I shouldn't expect loyalty in this neighborhood.

95
00:05:55,289 --> 00:05:57,559
But I still had to try to make something of myself in this field.

96
00:05:58,530 --> 00:06:00,989
So that made me feel really pathetic. So what?

97
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:05,299
Do you feel good now?

98
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:14,739
You can keep going.

99
00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:16,039
Don't be ridiculous.

100
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:19,150
You were crying your eyes out when I got here.

101
00:06:19,580 --> 00:06:21,850
You made me cower like a scared kid.

102
00:06:49,780 --> 00:06:50,780
Thank you.

103
00:08:06,989 --> 00:08:08,520
Thank you, sir.

105

(Closed)

106
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:28,978
Should I pour you a drink?

107
00:08:28,979 --> 00:08:30,010
Gosh.

108
00:08:38,989 --> 00:08:40,720
Then it's on me now.

109
00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:42,820
Lucky me.

110
00:08:49,999 --> 00:08:51,259
Academy instructors...

111
00:08:52,229 --> 00:08:54,170
rarely get attached to students.

112
00:08:55,269 --> 00:08:57,739
Otherwise, it'd be too hard on them every year.

113
00:08:58,170 --> 00:09:00,340
You all say that.

114
00:09:01,170 --> 00:09:03,080
But my bar is the busiest during the graduation season.

115
00:09:04,009 --> 00:09:06,479
They must be lonely. They drink quite a lot.

116
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:11,889
That's their way of trying to forget the students quickly.

117
00:09:12,850 --> 00:09:14,790
They try their best not to be curious about them.

118
00:09:16,389 --> 00:09:17,659
How much they grew up.

119
00:09:18,489 --> 00:09:20,060
What kind of person they've become.

120
00:09:20,690 --> 00:09:22,430
Wondering about that isn't up to us.

121
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:25,200
But...

122
00:09:25,930 --> 00:09:27,629
I'm curious about Jun Ho, though.

123
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:29,570
I wonder how much he'd grow.

124
00:09:31,710 --> 00:09:32,909
He's already all grown up, though.

125
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:36,979
Gosh. I'm such a pathetic man.

126
00:09:38,649 --> 00:09:40,748
My academy is about to go down in flames.

127
00:09:40,749 --> 00:09:42,619
But I'm here, wondering about Jun Ho.

128
00:09:42,879 --> 00:09:44,690
Gosh. Why do you say that?

129
00:09:45,050 --> 00:09:46,618
Even during wartime,

130
00:09:46,619 --> 00:09:48,920
people still pursue art, fall in love,

131
00:09:49,290 --> 00:09:51,190
and compete in sports games.

132
00:09:51,389 --> 00:09:52,389
You're right.

133
00:09:55,229 --> 00:09:56,229
Okay.

134
00:10:12,909 --> 00:10:14,379
It will be spring soon.

135
00:10:15,249 --> 00:10:17,279
Gosh. Time flies.

136
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:21,988
New students will come in,

137
00:10:21,989 --> 00:10:24,619
and the year will go by quickly again.

138
00:10:25,930 --> 00:10:28,330
You've overcome all your hardships so far.

139
00:10:31,159 --> 00:10:32,229
Right.

140
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:36,869
As long as my instructors decide to continue teaching at my academy.

143
00:11:02,759 --> 00:11:03,999
Don't do that.

144
00:11:05,729 --> 00:11:07,129
Using your coat as an umbrella...

145
00:11:07,369 --> 00:11:08,700
and running into the rain.

146
00:11:09,470 --> 00:11:10,700
I won't do that with you.

(Daechi Chase, Accepting new students)

Let's dry our clothes before we go. Please?

149
00:11:50,710 --> 00:11:52,210
It'll be awful if you catch a cold.

150
00:11:52,379 --> 00:11:53,409
Mind your own business.

151
00:11:55,080 --> 00:11:56,149
Fine.

152
00:11:56,920 --> 00:11:57,950
I'll tell you...

153
00:11:58,350 --> 00:11:59,820
why I was crying like a pathetic fool.

154
00:12:21,609 --> 00:12:22,639
I'm sorry...

155
00:12:23,940 --> 00:12:25,109
for upsetting you.

156
00:12:26,810 --> 00:12:29,050
But don't even think about how it would've been...

157
00:12:29,279 --> 00:12:30,550
if you weren't my teacher.

158
00:12:31,450 --> 00:12:32,820
I had never imagined such a scenario.

159
00:12:35,090 --> 00:12:36,389
Our age difference...

160
00:12:36,989 --> 00:12:39,460
or the prettiest girl in my school who had a crush on me...

161
00:12:40,190 --> 00:12:41,389
Just forget all of that.

162
00:12:41,830 --> 00:12:43,499
I don't even remember her name.

163
00:12:45,229 --> 00:12:46,229
I do.

164
00:12:47,769 --> 00:12:48,940
It was Cho Yoon Hee.

165
00:12:52,940 --> 00:12:55,580
I heard Seoung Gyu and Ho Jae talk about that. So I knew.

166
00:13:00,479 --> 00:13:02,619
Tell me. Why did you cry?

167
00:13:07,090 --> 00:13:08,119
Jun Ho.

168
00:13:13,060 --> 00:13:14,229
Mr. Lee.

169

"Nothing scares me in this world."

170
00:13:21,129 --> 00:13:23,070
"Once I set my mind to it, I get it done."

171
00:13:24,700 --> 00:13:26,810
I realized all of that was nothing but pathetic self-delusion.

172
00:13:29,080 --> 00:13:32,050
I realized it only after seeing you getting torn apart by the vultures.

173
00:13:33,409 --> 00:13:35,680
I failed to see what would happen to you.

174
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:40,449
I deceived myself by hiding behind the argument...

175
00:13:40,450 --> 00:13:42,060
that all I needed was your love.

176
00:13:43,659 --> 00:13:45,190
I was embarrassed by everything I did.

177
00:13:48,029 --> 00:13:49,599
My mother researched every nook and corner of Daechi-dong...

178
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:50,700
and found you.

179
00:13:52,330 --> 00:13:54,970
I got my grades up thanks to you. But I acted like a big shot genius.

180
00:13:55,639 --> 00:13:56,739
That was just ridiculous.

181
00:13:58,239 --> 00:13:59,309
I acted like I accomplished...

182
00:13:59,310 --> 00:14:01,209
something amazing by getting into a decent school.

183
00:14:01,210 --> 00:14:02,279
That was just absurd.

184
00:14:03,340 --> 00:14:04,340
Jun Ho.

185
00:14:05,710 --> 00:14:08,549
My parents and you were always ready to support me...

186
00:14:08,550 --> 00:14:09,879
with complete confidence in me.

187
00:14:12,050 --> 00:14:13,550
The moment I left their safe nest,

188
00:14:15,290 --> 00:14:16,589
a mere incident like this was enough to make me crumble.

189
00:14:16,590 --> 00:14:17,690
That's how weak I was.

190
00:14:18,759 --> 00:14:19,859
That crossed my mind.

191
00:14:21,830 --> 00:14:23,658
But in the midst of everything, when I heard...

192
00:14:23,659 --> 00:14:25,330
how you thought you were to blame for everything,

193
00:14:26,229 --> 00:14:27,570
it became clear to me.

194
00:14:29,369 --> 00:14:30,869
That I hadn't...

195
00:14:33,310 --> 00:14:36,080
grown up at all from the kid you met for the first time...

196
00:14:37,009 --> 00:14:38,210
in the classroom.

197
00:14:39,649 --> 00:14:40,710
That's...

198
00:14:42,649 --> 00:14:44,180
just how I am.

199
00:14:45,450 --> 00:14:46,989
You say that's how you are.

200
00:14:47,790 --> 00:14:49,619
But I wasn't able to change you even one bit...

201
00:14:51,359 --> 00:14:52,659
when I said I loved you.

202
00:14:59,369 --> 00:15:00,470
I must...

203
00:15:01,629 --> 00:15:04,070
get out of that small classroom from ten years ago.

204
00:15:06,409 --> 00:15:08,609
I read the books you gave me and wrote down what you told me.

205
00:15:09,909 --> 00:15:11,239
I had enough compliments...

206
00:15:12,149 --> 00:15:15,009
and was adored enough by doing the things you told me.

207
00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:18,749
Thank you.

208
00:15:24,420 --> 00:15:25,489
But...

209
00:15:28,999 --> 00:15:30,029
I...

210
00:15:31,129 --> 00:15:32,200
It's long overdue.

211
00:15:34,470 --> 00:15:35,570
Give it to me now.

212
00:15:37,769 --> 00:15:38,909
My well-deserved diploma.

213
00:15:48,050 --> 00:15:49,649
There's one more thing that's bothering me.

214
00:15:49,950 --> 00:15:51,950
(Daechi Chase Hall of Fame)

215
00:15:58,190 --> 00:15:59,529
Before I joined the academy,

216
00:16:00,489 --> 00:16:01,930
I came to see you. Remember that?

217
00:16:04,960 --> 00:16:06,330
This was the very place...

218
00:16:07,129 --> 00:16:08,229
you told me this.

219
00:16:08,470 --> 00:16:11,399
Of course. The sky is the limit for you.

220
00:16:12,739 --> 00:16:14,310
I'll return what you said.

221
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:17,580
I don't need it. I don't need that encouragement.

222
00:16:17,840 --> 00:16:19,979
You don't need to have such a desperate thought that...

223
00:16:20,249 --> 00:16:21,608
this is the only way you can make a living.

224
00:16:21,609 --> 00:16:22,979
I'm 35 years old.

225
00:16:23,879 --> 00:16:26,690
I'll support you even if you want to try out to become an idol star.

226
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:30,290
Let's go. I have a class in the morning.

227
00:16:31,420 --> 00:16:33,460
(Daechi Chase Hall of Fame)

228
00:17:41,189 --> 00:17:43,230
I wondered how it would've been if I were never your teacher.

229
00:17:49,340 --> 00:17:51,639
How would it have been if we were around the same age?

230
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:57,139
Didn't you get rained on on your way home?

231
00:19:00,969 --> 00:19:02,379
It started to pour down all of a sudden.

232
00:19:03,780 --> 00:19:06,280
Gosh. I told you there was no need to escort me home.

233
00:19:06,550 --> 00:19:08,010
You were stubborn for no reason.

234
00:19:08,209 --> 00:19:10,850
Gosh. Getting caught in the rain isn't a big deal.

235
00:19:12,949 --> 00:19:15,320
By the way, how's your throat?

236
00:19:16,260 --> 00:19:17,959
You went pretty hard at the karaoke.

237
00:19:18,459 --> 00:19:20,629
So you don't know what it means to go hard.

238
00:19:21,389 --> 00:19:23,060
I didn't even show you half of my talent.

239
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:34,270
- Hey. - Hi.

240
00:19:35,310 --> 00:19:37,639
I have class from 1pm to 4pm. Bye.

241
00:19:38,179 --> 00:19:39,609
- Gosh. - Hello.

242
00:19:39,810 --> 00:19:43,479
I didn't know you were on the phone. I wouldn't have interrupted you.

243
00:19:43,480 --> 00:19:44,619
- I see. - Gosh.

244
00:19:45,050 --> 00:19:47,448
It's hard to tell when people use wireless earbuds.

245
00:19:47,449 --> 00:19:48,889
It's fine.

246
00:19:50,159 --> 00:19:52,059
I guess you didn't have breakfast.

247
00:19:52,060 --> 00:19:53,590
I didn't.

248
00:19:56,060 --> 00:19:57,459
Gosh, it smells great.

249
00:19:58,699 --> 00:20:00,629
Let's pick some bread. It's on me.

250
00:20:03,100 --> 00:20:05,409
- It's a bribe. - To me?

251
00:20:06,740 --> 00:20:09,040
If we're on the same side,

252
00:20:09,139 --> 00:20:11,040
I want to make a good impression on you.

253
00:20:12,179 --> 00:20:13,449
I teach social studies.

254
00:20:14,050 --> 00:20:16,520
I ought to be on good terms with Korean instructors.

255
00:20:18,580 --> 00:20:19,590
Come in.

256
00:20:50,179 --> 00:20:51,179
Gosh.

257
00:20:51,820 --> 00:20:53,350
Ms. Seo...

258
00:20:53,919 --> 00:20:56,888
had been doing a very good job of crossing selling...

259
00:20:56,889 --> 00:20:58,189
other subjects.

260
00:20:59,260 --> 00:21:01,090
She always gave out flyers during her class.

261
00:21:01,629 --> 00:21:03,999
She scheduled the classes perfectly, so they had time to eat...

262
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,159
before other classes here.

263
00:21:06,429 --> 00:21:07,429
Gosh.

264
00:21:08,669 --> 00:21:10,000
She always thought of everything.

265
00:21:12,040 --> 00:21:14,070
When we were going head-to-head with Choisun Academy,

266
00:21:14,510 --> 00:21:17,040
some instructors weren't happy with the advertisement.

267
00:21:17,639 --> 00:21:20,350
She promised them to bring students to them to calm them down.

268
00:21:21,409 --> 00:21:24,179
So you're telling me instructors who had been close to Ms. Seo...

269
00:21:24,679 --> 00:21:26,949
are facing the biggest damage?

270
00:21:30,159 --> 00:21:31,959
How ironic.

271
00:21:33,389 --> 00:21:35,600
If there's anything that can comfort you,

272
00:21:36,500 --> 00:21:39,129
the Korean department wasn't affected that severely.

273
00:21:40,199 --> 00:21:42,840
The students didn't overlap with Ms. Seo's students.

274
00:21:43,169 --> 00:21:45,340
Their class schedules were completely separated.

275
00:21:46,810 --> 00:21:47,909
Gosh.

276
00:21:52,010 --> 00:21:53,649
We can't lower our guard just yet.

277
00:21:55,980 --> 00:21:57,020
What do you mean?

278
00:21:59,020 --> 00:22:00,050
The vice-director...

279
00:22:00,689 --> 00:22:01,949
Woo Seung Hui...

280
00:22:03,689 --> 00:22:05,419
created another bait.

281
00:22:11,429 --> 00:22:13,699
Could you tell me in detail?

282
00:22:14,629 --> 00:22:15,740
Gosh.

283
00:22:16,340 --> 00:22:19,409
Woo Seung Hui left the academy with Hye Jin's class materials?

284
00:22:19,510 --> 00:22:22,609
Yes. She was using that to lure me into joining her.

285
00:22:23,010 --> 00:22:24,639
She promised I would take all of Chanyoung High's students.

286
00:22:25,810 --> 00:22:28,209
Wait. Why didn't you tell the others about this?

287
00:22:28,510 --> 00:22:30,350
"Look how evil Woo Seung Hui is."

288
00:22:30,520 --> 00:22:32,080
That's basically saying,

289
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:35,119
"Ms. Seo is ruined beyond repair."

290
00:22:35,590 --> 00:22:36,659
"She's got nothing."

291
00:22:37,820 --> 00:22:38,990
You know?

292
00:22:40,330 --> 00:22:41,359
Gosh.

293
00:22:51,439 --> 00:22:52,570
Aren't you scared?

294
00:22:54,770 --> 00:22:56,639
You said you really wanted to teach in this neighborhood.

295
00:22:57,909 --> 00:22:59,209
We're all about to lose our job.

296
00:23:01,350 --> 00:23:02,580
I have people backing up.

297
00:23:05,080 --> 00:23:06,389
The kids like me.

298
00:23:07,449 --> 00:23:09,119
They will like me wherever I end up.

299
00:23:10,189 --> 00:23:11,260
Ms. Nam.

300
00:23:12,889 --> 00:23:13,889
You're cool.

301
00:23:19,530 --> 00:23:20,730
Gosh.

302
00:23:22,669 --> 00:23:23,840
Goodness.

303
00:23:24,500 --> 00:23:27,209
Are they Woo Seung Hui's archenemies or something?

304
00:23:31,939 --> 00:23:33,649
Why do you keep looking around?

305
00:23:33,750 --> 00:23:35,050
Oh, nothing.

306
00:23:35,379 --> 00:23:38,149
I'm surprised that you already have an office.

307
00:23:41,949 --> 00:23:45,290
This is why I always had a soft spot for you, Ms. Kim.

308
00:23:46,230 --> 00:23:48,159
You're cute and innocent.

309
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:50,859
That's why you get along with your students well.

310
00:23:51,500 --> 00:23:53,969
Well, I don't have to talk about how you're the prettiest teacher.

311
00:23:54,300 --> 00:23:56,600
Well, I wouldn't say I'm the prettiest teacher.

312
00:23:57,369 --> 00:23:59,340
Lee Jun Ho has low standards. That's all.

313
00:23:59,409 --> 00:24:01,669
Seo Hye Jin is nothing compared to you.

314
00:24:02,939 --> 00:24:06,609
But what's the point of flattering you like this?

315
00:24:06,949 --> 00:24:08,050
A professional...

316
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:11,780
shows respect through a contract.

317
00:24:14,419 --> 00:24:16,219
I see. Okay.

318
00:24:16,590 --> 00:24:17,689
I think...

319
00:24:18,159 --> 00:24:20,489
I'll be able to give you...

320
00:24:20,490 --> 00:24:22,030
a special incentive.

321
00:24:24,359 --> 00:24:26,300
How will we have our parent information session?

322
00:24:27,899 --> 00:24:30,369
Gosh. I should've gone to Mok-dong when they asked me.

323
00:24:30,899 --> 00:24:32,609
What if the vice-director really opens up an academy?

324
00:24:37,439 --> 00:24:39,149
You don't have class today. Why are you here?

325
00:24:39,850 --> 00:24:40,909
To study.

326
00:24:42,379 --> 00:24:44,250
I wonder why you even bother to lie when it's so obvious.

327
00:24:47,320 --> 00:24:48,689
You're waiting for Mr. Lee Myeong Jun, right?

328
00:24:49,159 --> 00:24:50,859
You've been glancing at his desk.

329
00:24:53,689 --> 00:24:54,760
I knew it.

330
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:57,000
I can't fool you.

331
00:24:59,030 --> 00:25:00,629
Are you upset that you couldn't kill him off yesterday?

332
00:25:00,869 --> 00:25:02,100
Will you finish him today?

333
00:25:04,939 --> 00:25:05,939
Yes.

334
00:25:06,040 --> 00:25:07,570
Gosh. The road is so slippery.

335
00:25:09,340 --> 00:25:10,510
Good morning.

336
00:25:10,840 --> 00:25:12,609
- Are you preparing for your class? - Yes.

337
00:25:12,909 --> 00:25:15,409
I knew it. You're nothing without a backbone.

338
00:25:16,020 --> 00:25:17,580
Whatever happens to her...

339
00:25:19,090 --> 00:25:20,149
Is this the power of love?

340
00:25:24,659 --> 00:25:27,230
I'll call the ambulance. Make sure to finish him this time.

341
00:25:38,300 --> 00:25:39,369
What?

342
00:25:44,280 --> 00:25:45,340
What do you want?

343
00:25:50,350 --> 00:25:53,350
You know, I had always wanted to point this out.

344
00:25:53,919 --> 00:25:56,659
But your attitude toward your senior instructors...

345
00:25:57,060 --> 00:25:58,659
is completely wrong.

346
00:26:00,689 --> 00:26:01,830
Is that so?

347
00:26:03,959 --> 00:26:05,000
I didn't know.

348
00:26:07,830 --> 00:26:11,240
Yes. So if you need to talk to your senior instructor,

349
00:26:11,699 --> 00:26:13,869
you must be polite and approach him sensibly.

350
00:26:16,510 --> 00:26:17,709
Be polite and approach sensibly.

351
00:26:21,480 --> 00:26:22,919
Is there anything else I can fix?

352
00:26:24,980 --> 00:26:26,050
Tell me everything.

353
00:26:26,790 --> 00:26:29,389
Tell me what I had been doing wrong and things that were bothering you.

354
00:26:33,590 --> 00:26:35,389
You can think about that on your own.

355
00:26:37,459 --> 00:26:38,459
Then...

356
00:26:40,070 --> 00:26:42,969
I'll apologize to you for being rude to you yesterday.

357
00:26:44,800 --> 00:26:46,570
I apologize for my immature thoughts...

358
00:26:48,409 --> 00:26:49,439
and actions.

359
00:26:54,510 --> 00:26:55,679
See?

360
00:26:56,280 --> 00:26:58,050
You don't know the first thing about a proper apology.

361
00:26:58,219 --> 00:26:59,649
That's not how you apologize.

362
00:27:00,550 --> 00:27:03,060
You must clearly state what you did wrong,

363
00:27:03,419 --> 00:27:05,459
how you inconvenienced the other party,

364
00:27:05,619 --> 00:27:06,990
what you reflected on,

365
00:27:07,389 --> 00:27:09,129
and how you would take responsibility for it.

366
00:27:09,359 --> 00:27:11,030
These are the things you must specify.

367
00:27:11,800 --> 00:27:13,570
I talked down to you.

368
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:15,730
I insulted you by using my students.

369
00:27:16,469 --> 00:27:17,570
I apologize for that.

370
00:27:18,369 --> 00:27:19,510
I should have...

371
00:27:20,209 --> 00:27:22,510
explained everything after calmly listening to your opinion.

372
00:27:24,139 --> 00:27:25,850
But I only focused on how wronged I felt.

373
00:27:28,350 --> 00:27:29,750
Ms. Seo and I...

374
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:33,090
didn't think how it could cause a misunderstanding for everyone.

375
00:27:35,219 --> 00:27:37,919
From now on, before I act on anything,

376
00:27:40,060 --> 00:27:41,859
I will be polite, use a sensible approach,

377
00:27:43,800 --> 00:27:46,399
and seek advice from my senior instructors.

378
00:27:49,169 --> 00:27:50,270
So you've been reflecting?

379
00:27:50,899 --> 00:27:51,969
To my core.

380
00:27:54,869 --> 00:27:55,909
Well, then.

381
00:27:57,810 --> 00:27:59,480
I don't hold a grudge or anything.

382
00:28:03,219 --> 00:28:05,449
Get back to work. I must prepare for my class.

383
00:28:14,060 --> 00:28:15,129
Right.

384
00:28:17,730 --> 00:28:18,959
I sent you an email.

385
00:28:20,070 --> 00:28:21,070
What email?

386
00:28:22,129 --> 00:28:23,199
You should check.

387
00:28:35,209 --> 00:28:38,280
(To Lee Myeong Jun, from Lee Jun Ho)

388
00:28:38,320 --> 00:28:39,919
The college entrance exam, the mock exams,

389
00:28:40,290 --> 00:28:41,619
the texts from the city and provincial offices of education,

390
00:28:42,149 --> 00:28:43,689
analysis on literature and linguistic understanding,

391
00:28:44,490 --> 00:28:46,590
and the background information of the selected non-fiction texts.

392
00:28:48,030 --> 00:28:49,729
I summarized them while making my study materials.

393
00:28:49,730 --> 00:28:52,330
There's still room for improvement, but you'll find some use for them.

394
00:28:54,770 --> 00:28:57,000
What was that? I thought you were going to finish him.

395
00:29:00,810 --> 00:29:02,879
Did you plant some kind of virus in the email?

396
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:05,080
Don't you have a class to teach?

397
00:29:07,879 --> 00:29:08,949
I do.

398
00:29:21,389 --> 00:29:23,260
Did Mr. Lee get up on the wrong side of the bed today?

399
00:29:23,859 --> 00:29:25,500
It hurt my pride just watching him.

400
00:29:26,199 --> 00:29:28,469
I'll relay the message. I'm sure he'll be happy to hear that.

401
00:29:53,359 --> 00:29:54,359
What was that?

402
00:29:58,060 --> 00:29:59,570
I'm not that dense.

403
00:29:59,770 --> 00:30:01,030
What are you plotting?

404
00:30:05,100 --> 00:30:06,240
Nothing.

405
00:30:06,869 --> 00:30:08,239
I'm truly reflecting on what I did.

406
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:09,280
What's your goal?

407
00:30:16,219 --> 00:30:17,780
Make it quick. I have a class.

408
00:30:19,020 --> 00:30:21,590
Given what happened, what could I possibly want?

409
00:30:25,459 --> 00:30:26,590
But there's one thing I can try.

410
00:30:28,659 --> 00:30:30,600
Trying to get as many instructors as possible to stay here.

411
00:30:31,830 --> 00:30:32,969
If I can do that,

412
00:30:33,770 --> 00:30:35,429
I would even crawl under your legs.

413
00:30:36,570 --> 00:30:38,539
Why would you do that? I don't need you to do that.

414
00:30:38,540 --> 00:30:39,869
Then tell me what you need.

415
00:30:40,810 --> 00:30:42,368
Ms. Seo's career is going down anyway.

416
00:30:42,369 --> 00:30:43,639
Anyone can rise to become the ace of the academy.

417
00:30:44,540 --> 00:30:46,280
Our academy needs a new leader.

418
00:30:47,609 --> 00:30:49,919
Choisun Academy has been focusing on Korean for 20 years.

419
00:30:50,550 --> 00:30:52,418
Choisun Academy is known to have top-tier instructors.

420
00:30:52,419 --> 00:30:54,388
Instead of competing against them, you should just...

421
00:30:54,389 --> 00:30:55,590
Are you a partial owner of the academy?

422
00:30:56,219 --> 00:30:57,290
Why are you going this far?

423
00:30:59,629 --> 00:31:01,730
I like Ms. Seo a lot.

424
00:31:04,060 --> 00:31:05,399
What the...

425
00:31:05,730 --> 00:31:07,428
Her causing the academy to shut down...

426
00:31:07,429 --> 00:31:08,629
and the instructors to lose their jobs?

427
00:31:09,939 --> 00:31:11,699
I don't want her to live with that guilt.

428
00:31:15,669 --> 00:31:17,079
There isn't a lot of time,

429
00:31:17,080 --> 00:31:19,649
and other academies are ready to welcome high school freshmen.

430
00:31:20,449 --> 00:31:22,080
Every year, there's always a wave of fresh students.

431
00:31:22,580 --> 00:31:25,179
There isn't a better time to change your reputation.

432
00:31:26,649 --> 00:31:29,149
I've been in this field way longer than you.

433
00:31:29,389 --> 00:31:30,820
Don't patronize me with basic facts.

434
00:31:32,260 --> 00:31:33,260
I apologize.

435
00:31:52,379 --> 00:31:53,510
You'd better be here...

436
00:31:54,010 --> 00:31:56,010
because you're prepared to the point...

437
00:31:56,280 --> 00:31:58,050
where you've memorized all your students' names.

438
00:32:00,619 --> 00:32:03,689
More than 100 students jumped academies at once.

439
00:32:04,060 --> 00:32:05,119
Right.

440
00:32:05,619 --> 00:32:08,389
That means you should be exceptionally busy.

441
00:32:10,159 --> 00:32:11,530
The files on the students...

442
00:32:12,060 --> 00:32:13,570
landed in my lap almost too quickly.

443
00:32:15,429 --> 00:32:17,000
For that, you should be grateful.

444
00:32:17,840 --> 00:32:20,310
We're letting you focus only on your class.

445
00:32:22,879 --> 00:32:24,340
The scandal regarding Ms. Seo and Mr. Lee.

446
00:32:25,580 --> 00:32:26,810
Were you the one who...

447
00:32:29,820 --> 00:32:30,919
I'd like to know.

448
00:32:36,560 --> 00:32:38,520
I do not discuss business...

449
00:32:38,760 --> 00:32:40,230
with anyone.

450
00:32:41,389 --> 00:32:42,629
I never have,

451
00:32:42,899 --> 00:32:45,600
I never will, and I won't start today.

452
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:50,169
I'm the vice-director.

453
00:32:50,869 --> 00:32:52,639
Mr. Pyo.

454
00:32:54,010 --> 00:32:56,480
Teach your students, gather more,

455
00:32:58,439 --> 00:32:59,980
and stay in your lane.

456
00:33:01,350 --> 00:33:02,750
I'll be in touch.

457
00:33:02,879 --> 00:33:04,948
I'm sorry I couldn't have lunch with you.

458
00:33:04,949 --> 00:33:07,790
It's all right. I'm sure you have a lot of people to meet.

459
00:33:08,050 --> 00:33:09,050
Right.

460
00:33:09,490 --> 00:33:11,290
- I'll get going. - Sure.

461
00:33:13,129 --> 00:33:15,530
- Take care. - You too.

462
00:33:27,840 --> 00:33:29,168
It seems as though Lee Jun Ho...

463
00:33:29,169 --> 00:33:30,379
will suggest something to Lee Myeong Jun.

464
00:33:31,540 --> 00:33:33,550
(Daechi Chase)

465
00:33:35,679 --> 00:33:36,780
I'll talk to him.

466
00:33:37,179 --> 00:33:38,850
Just make sure to gather all my things,

467
00:33:39,520 --> 00:33:41,389
and reset my computer.

468
00:33:50,530 --> 00:33:51,600
That's who...

469
00:33:52,760 --> 00:33:53,969
Woo Seung Hui is.

470
00:33:55,530 --> 00:33:58,600
The thoughts one keeps buried deep inside?

471
00:33:59,300 --> 00:34:02,340
She has a knack for sniffing out the musty scent they give off.

472
00:34:10,719 --> 00:34:12,119
Lee Myeong Jun is one...

473
00:34:13,250 --> 00:34:15,020
to be easily swayed.

474
00:34:21,190 --> 00:34:23,159
(Lee Myeong Jun, Korean)

475
00:34:27,400 --> 00:34:30,469
(Lee Jun Ho, Korean)

(Vice-director Woo Seung Hui)

477
00:34:57,929 --> 00:35:00,529
(Vice-director Woo Seung Hui)

478
00:35:05,540 --> 00:35:07,670
Are these the students leaving our academy?

479
00:35:08,639 --> 00:35:09,779
I'm afraid so.

480
00:35:10,380 --> 00:35:13,710
Ms. Choi and I have been...

481
00:35:13,909 --> 00:35:15,909
calling them left and right.

482
00:35:17,380 --> 00:35:19,079
(Possibility of re-enrollment)

483
00:35:19,080 --> 00:35:21,689
I knew students would be leaving us, but...

484
00:35:21,690 --> 00:35:23,319
(Possibility of re-enrollment)

485
00:35:24,589 --> 00:35:25,589
This means...

486
00:35:25,659 --> 00:35:28,489
we'll have to shut down some of our classes.

487
00:35:29,799 --> 00:35:31,299
Well, you see...

488
00:35:31,659 --> 00:35:33,869
Director Kim said...

489
00:35:34,670 --> 00:35:36,738
that such requirements shouldn't matter...

490
00:35:36,739 --> 00:35:39,869
and that we should allow the instructors to teach...

491
00:35:40,069 --> 00:35:41,139
without making them worry.

492
00:35:44,409 --> 00:35:46,380
But these students...

493
00:35:48,110 --> 00:35:49,549
didn't say anything to me.

494
00:35:51,449 --> 00:35:53,889
The group chat isn't active,

495
00:35:54,819 --> 00:35:56,989
and I haven't received any individual texts.

496
00:35:58,389 --> 00:36:01,690
Then, how can you know that you have completely...

497
00:36:02,790 --> 00:36:03,900
understood this text?

498
00:36:04,730 --> 00:36:06,229
You have to be able...

499
00:36:06,230 --> 00:36:09,000
to rewrite the text in your own words.

500
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:11,169
I'm sure you've come across this often...

501
00:36:11,170 --> 00:36:13,339
in English class. What is it called?

502
00:36:13,540 --> 00:36:16,170
Ms. Seo, class should've been over by now.

503
00:36:16,480 --> 00:36:18,079
Sorry. I'll wrap it up in less than a minute.

504
00:36:18,080 --> 00:36:19,139
What is it called?

505
00:36:19,650 --> 00:36:20,809
- Paraphrasing. - Paraphrasing.

506
00:36:20,810 --> 00:36:23,080
Right. It's like restating the text.

507
00:36:23,150 --> 00:36:25,750
Vocabulary and reading comprehension are vital tools.

508
00:36:25,819 --> 00:36:27,549
If you learn how to be good at this,

509
00:36:27,819 --> 00:36:30,059
you'll realize that your Korean and English grades...

510
00:36:30,060 --> 00:36:31,619
are connected.

511
00:36:41,029 --> 00:36:42,629
Ms. Seo's career is going down anyway.

512
00:36:42,630 --> 00:36:43,969
Anyone can rise to become the ace of the academy.

513
00:37:00,589 --> 00:37:01,819
Where are the ones...

514
00:37:02,049 --> 00:37:03,389
who caused this mess?

515
00:37:05,219 --> 00:37:07,290
(Vice-director's Office)

516
00:37:12,199 --> 00:37:13,199
Come in.

517
00:37:19,500 --> 00:37:20,509
Hey.

518
00:37:22,210 --> 00:37:23,409
Are you getting back from lunch?

519
00:37:25,179 --> 00:37:26,850
No, I'm on my way out to meet someone.

520
00:37:29,409 --> 00:37:30,549
What you did was quite impressive.

521
00:37:31,949 --> 00:37:33,949
That must've caught Lee Myeong Jun off guard.

522
00:37:39,560 --> 00:37:41,928
(Daechi Chase)

523
00:37:41,929 --> 00:37:43,029
Why are you looking at me like that?

524
00:37:44,060 --> 00:37:45,799
Didn't you come here to tell me something?

525
00:37:48,630 --> 00:37:49,698
Just so you know,

526
00:37:49,699 --> 00:37:51,139
apologies or whatnot won't work on me.

527
00:37:51,869 --> 00:37:53,170
I'm not Lee Myeong Jun.

528
00:37:55,409 --> 00:37:57,139
I have no reason to apologize to you.

529
00:37:58,880 --> 00:38:00,350
You don't think you wronged me?

530
00:38:00,949 --> 00:38:01,949
No.

531
00:38:03,350 --> 00:38:05,219
Then what's with this awkward encounter?

532
00:38:06,150 --> 00:38:08,350
It's not like we have anything to chat about.

533
00:38:18,830 --> 00:38:20,069
I wanted to give you a chance.

534
00:38:22,600 --> 00:38:23,869
Get your act together...

535
00:38:24,900 --> 00:38:26,000
and stop sinking any further.

536
00:38:30,980 --> 00:38:32,239
Hye Jin's like that too,

537
00:38:34,810 --> 00:38:37,549
but you're clueless as to what's happening.

538
00:38:39,319 --> 00:38:40,790
Who do you think is sinking right now?

539
00:38:41,420 --> 00:38:42,449
You.

540
00:38:44,159 --> 00:38:46,460
Going this far to ruin the person you had feelings for...

541
00:38:47,790 --> 00:38:48,988
is hardly sane.

542
00:38:48,989 --> 00:38:50,029
You're lucky...

543
00:38:51,230 --> 00:38:52,799
not to have even known this feeling.

544
00:38:56,500 --> 00:38:58,069
Fellowship, friendship, or loyalty.

545
00:38:59,639 --> 00:39:00,868
I bet you've never had to be in someone's life...

546
00:39:00,869 --> 00:39:02,069
masking your love for something above.

547
00:39:03,610 --> 00:39:04,610
I have.

548
00:39:05,710 --> 00:39:07,779
I moved out of my parents' house...

549
00:39:09,009 --> 00:39:10,420
to live closer to Ms. Seo.

550
00:39:14,420 --> 00:39:15,719
When you started dating,

551
00:39:16,719 --> 00:39:18,420
she should've told me.

552
00:39:19,690 --> 00:39:21,560
She should've stopped me from orbiting around her.

553
00:39:24,529 --> 00:39:27,100
She should've thought about how humiliated I'd feel.

554
00:39:28,799 --> 00:39:30,669
What's humiliating...

555
00:39:30,670 --> 00:39:32,900
about orbiting around the person you like?

556
00:39:34,670 --> 00:39:36,908
Blowing up her world because of it...

557
00:39:36,909 --> 00:39:38,079
- is more shameful. - Shut it...

558
00:39:38,080 --> 00:39:39,080
if you don't know any better.

559
00:39:39,081 --> 00:39:40,150
That...

560
00:39:42,049 --> 00:39:43,319
is how criminals think.

561
00:39:54,830 --> 00:39:55,830
Lee Jun Ho.

562
00:39:58,259 --> 00:39:59,429
You'd better watch your words.

563
00:39:59,759 --> 00:40:02,000
"You made me do something this bad."

564
00:40:04,040 --> 00:40:05,569
That's how criminals justify themselves.

565
00:40:08,839 --> 00:40:10,679
Who are you trying to teach?

566
00:40:12,739 --> 00:40:14,750
I also used to be one of your instructors.

567
00:40:15,009 --> 00:40:17,980
I'm just a guy who's warning the person...

568
00:40:20,049 --> 00:40:21,150
bullying his girlfriend.

569
00:40:24,119 --> 00:40:25,690
I'm meeting Ms. Woo.

570
00:40:27,560 --> 00:40:28,929
But I wanted to confirm something first.

571
00:40:30,360 --> 00:40:31,830
Yoon Ji Seok and Woo Seung Hui...

572
00:40:32,529 --> 00:40:34,330
only recently joined forces.

573
00:40:34,699 --> 00:40:36,299
I had to test your loyalty.

574
00:40:37,040 --> 00:40:39,239
I wanted to know how quickly you'd tell her...

575
00:40:40,239 --> 00:40:41,540
about what happened this morning...

576
00:40:41,739 --> 00:40:42,869
and how serious you are...

577
00:40:46,580 --> 00:40:49,049
about ruining Seo Hye Jin and her career.

578
00:40:55,020 --> 00:40:56,250
I have my answer.

579
00:40:58,060 --> 00:40:59,089
I do.

580
00:41:20,009 --> 00:41:22,080
(Daechi Chase)

581
00:41:32,960 --> 00:41:34,929
(Vice-director's Office)

582
00:41:44,339 --> 00:41:45,698
(Daechi Chase)

583
00:41:45,699 --> 00:41:46,739
It's Mr. Lee.

584
00:41:48,139 --> 00:41:49,639
Can you take this, Min Ji?

585
00:41:50,739 --> 00:41:51,909
- I'll be on standby. - Okay.

586
00:41:59,020 --> 00:42:00,020
Where are you going?

587
00:42:00,319 --> 00:42:01,389
Hey.

588
00:42:02,319 --> 00:42:04,989
Oh, I have a lunch appointment.

589
00:42:05,960 --> 00:42:06,960
With whom?

590
00:42:07,360 --> 00:42:09,488
(Daechi Chase)

591
00:42:09,489 --> 00:42:10,529
Vice-director Woo Seung Hui.

592
00:42:11,699 --> 00:42:13,299
Don't go there. Knowing your temper...

593
00:42:17,469 --> 00:42:19,540
(Prepare for the KSAT with Daechi Chase.)

594
00:42:22,509 --> 00:42:23,540
Is that them?

595
00:42:24,310 --> 00:42:25,339
They're still together.

596
00:42:38,560 --> 00:42:39,790
I know you're afraid.

597
00:42:40,130 --> 00:42:41,560
Gosh. I'm not afraid.

598
00:42:41,989 --> 00:42:44,259
Everything from Mr. Pyo to Choisun Academy.

599
00:42:45,360 --> 00:42:47,769
It'd feel like everything you planned became a boomerang...

600
00:42:47,770 --> 00:42:49,270
and hit you in the throat.

601
00:42:50,270 --> 00:42:52,900
This must be your first time getting caught up in gossip.

602
00:42:54,509 --> 00:42:56,040
I get why you're shying away.

603
00:42:56,909 --> 00:42:59,909
So eat a hearty lunch...

604
00:43:00,549 --> 00:43:01,909
and teach your class.

605
00:43:03,779 --> 00:43:06,650
You haven't yet told me what you said to Lee Myeong Jun.

606
00:43:07,250 --> 00:43:08,350
I will when I get back.

607
00:43:10,889 --> 00:43:11,960
But...

608
00:43:16,429 --> 00:43:18,529
I find this a bit upsetting.

609
00:43:24,600 --> 00:43:25,600
See you later.

610
00:43:47,830 --> 00:43:48,830
Come in.

611
00:43:50,860 --> 00:43:52,400
- Hey. - Hello.

612
00:44:09,750 --> 00:44:11,920
I made sure I was on time. Did you wait for long?

613
00:44:12,449 --> 00:44:13,449
No.

614
00:44:14,420 --> 00:44:15,819
I got here early.

615
00:44:16,350 --> 00:44:18,219
The thought of seeing you excited me.

616
00:44:19,759 --> 00:44:20,960
Thank you for calling.

617
00:44:21,659 --> 00:44:22,889
Don't say that.

618
00:44:23,060 --> 00:44:25,230
You sent me an invitation first.

619
00:44:27,469 --> 00:44:29,928
You could've just called if you wanted to see me.

620
00:44:29,929 --> 00:44:31,900
You didn't have to go through Myeong Jun.

621
00:44:32,739 --> 00:44:34,940
I thought it was likely you'd refuse to see me.

622
00:44:35,909 --> 00:44:38,139
Oh, dear. How come?

623
00:44:38,980 --> 00:44:42,009
Because Lee Jun Ho must seem useless.

624
00:44:43,049 --> 00:44:45,350
Because I'm just a kid who follows Seo Hye Jin around.

625
00:44:45,949 --> 00:44:48,219
You must've felt a pang of guilt too.

626
00:44:48,650 --> 00:44:50,389
Considering what you did to Ms. Seo.

627
00:44:53,259 --> 00:44:54,630
I wanted to make my presence known...

628
00:44:55,790 --> 00:44:58,259
and test Myeong Jun and Ji Seok's loyalty.

629
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:00,869
So I went through the hassle of doing this.

630
00:45:02,230 --> 00:45:03,299
You don't...

631
00:45:03,839 --> 00:45:06,469
really intend to side with Myeong Jun?

632
00:45:06,799 --> 00:45:07,869
I hope to.

633
00:45:08,639 --> 00:45:11,179
It would be hard, though, since we'd be up against you.

634
00:45:16,250 --> 00:45:17,279
How amazing.

635
00:45:18,480 --> 00:45:21,219
I feel almost jealous.

636
00:45:23,020 --> 00:45:24,020
Of me?

637
00:45:24,889 --> 00:45:27,230
Of your youth, to be exact.

638
00:45:28,889 --> 00:45:31,400
Love gives you strength and energy, doesn't it?

639
00:45:32,130 --> 00:45:33,159
Yes.

640
00:45:34,670 --> 00:45:37,139
How young, tender, and sweet of you.

641
00:45:38,040 --> 00:45:39,969
But you're a seasoned veteran.

642
00:45:40,409 --> 00:45:42,068
Armed with intellect and strategy.

643
00:45:42,069 --> 00:45:44,339
Goodness. Well, thank you.

644
00:45:48,080 --> 00:45:49,509
So...

645
00:45:51,920 --> 00:45:53,650
Instead of resorting to this,

646
00:45:56,219 --> 00:45:58,319
won't it be better to just make a clean break?

647
00:46:00,989 --> 00:46:03,130
Is that why you wanted to see me?

648
00:46:04,600 --> 00:46:05,799
To give me advice?

649
00:46:06,330 --> 00:46:07,429
To plead with you.

650
00:46:08,400 --> 00:46:10,469
This academy means more to me than my alma mater.

651
00:46:13,069 --> 00:46:14,770
I don't think I can do that.

652
00:46:15,610 --> 00:46:17,440
The adults have their reasons.

653
00:46:17,909 --> 00:46:20,509
Don't you care for your juniors' respect or support?

654
00:46:23,150 --> 00:46:25,049
How about you show...

655
00:46:25,420 --> 00:46:29,150
some more care and support for your girlfriend?

656
00:46:31,960 --> 00:46:34,529
Hye Jin looked so frail. A gust of wind could break her bone.

657
00:46:36,060 --> 00:46:37,500
How much longer...

658
00:46:37,699 --> 00:46:40,900
are you planning to watch her stay up at night to teach kids?

659
00:46:43,170 --> 00:46:44,469
She gave up what she wanted to do...

660
00:46:44,839 --> 00:46:48,569
and worked her whole life to support her family.

661
00:46:49,040 --> 00:46:51,079
Just when she thought she could take things slow,

662
00:46:51,080 --> 00:46:52,980
she was facing her end as an academy instructor.

663
00:46:53,110 --> 00:46:54,948
She doesn't have the stamina she used to,

664
00:46:54,949 --> 00:46:56,679
and she definitely isn't as smart.

665
00:46:58,619 --> 00:47:02,289
Wouldn't a decent man succeed as soon as possible...

666
00:47:02,290 --> 00:47:03,789
so he could take care of...

667
00:47:03,790 --> 00:47:05,489
the woman he loved?

668
00:47:08,690 --> 00:47:09,690
Guess what?

669
00:47:11,130 --> 00:47:12,560
When you applied to join us,

670
00:47:13,259 --> 00:47:15,130
I gave your test lecture the highest mark.

671
00:47:16,600 --> 00:47:17,639
What?

672
00:47:18,100 --> 00:47:20,868
Your age, degree, stability, and potential.

673
00:47:20,869 --> 00:47:23,509
I thought highly of all of it, including your ambitious nature.

674
00:47:25,880 --> 00:47:26,940
I see.

675
00:47:27,049 --> 00:47:28,250
Now I'm thinking...

676
00:47:29,150 --> 00:47:31,119
it would be a waste to leave you behind.

677
00:47:34,949 --> 00:47:36,020
Don't you think...

678
00:47:36,949 --> 00:47:38,290
you called me a bit too late for that?

679
00:47:40,730 --> 00:47:41,860
To be honest,

680
00:47:42,560 --> 00:47:45,529
I thought trying to persuade you would be a waste of time.

681
00:47:46,659 --> 00:47:48,929
But you had the guts to come see me, so I'm having second thoughts.

682
00:47:50,900 --> 00:47:52,170
You should make the switch.

683
00:47:52,369 --> 00:47:55,509
You have great aspirations.

684
00:47:58,739 --> 00:48:01,080
I don't think Choi Hyung Sun would approve of me...

685
00:48:01,380 --> 00:48:02,449
because of the Heewon High incident.

686
00:48:02,480 --> 00:48:04,480
I can put in a good word for you, of course.

687
00:48:12,759 --> 00:48:14,529
Can I take off my coat?

688
00:48:14,929 --> 00:48:16,889
- Yes, of course. - Thanks.

689
00:48:25,639 --> 00:48:26,869
You really know nothing about this?

690
00:48:27,869 --> 00:48:29,610
You weren't behind it?

691
00:48:29,810 --> 00:48:31,480
What on earth...

692
00:48:31,509 --> 00:48:33,009
was in the email Jun Ho sent you?

693
00:48:33,610 --> 00:48:35,279
It really wasn't something you two set up?

694
00:48:36,150 --> 00:48:37,179
Mr. Lee.

695
00:48:41,290 --> 00:48:42,319
His teaching notes.

696
00:48:43,219 --> 00:48:44,219
And materials.

697
00:48:44,790 --> 00:48:46,389
They won't be of much use to me, though.

698
00:48:54,270 --> 00:48:55,299
Why...

699
00:48:56,270 --> 00:48:57,270
Why did he do that?

700
00:48:59,369 --> 00:49:00,639
Why are you asking me?

701
00:49:06,009 --> 00:49:07,850
He must want me to join him.

702
00:49:10,619 --> 00:49:11,619
Goodness.

703
00:49:12,520 --> 00:49:14,089
I'm going downstairs.

704
00:49:16,489 --> 00:49:17,489
What in the...

705
00:49:18,159 --> 00:49:19,489
Why would he...

706
00:49:25,830 --> 00:49:26,830
Gosh.

707
00:49:37,509 --> 00:49:38,509
Gosh.

708
00:49:39,779 --> 00:49:41,210
I should keep my wits about me.

709
00:49:43,880 --> 00:49:47,350
I just realized why people side with you...

710
00:49:47,719 --> 00:49:48,750
after just one meeting.

711
00:49:50,119 --> 00:49:52,119
- I can be quite persuasive, right? - Yes.

712
00:49:52,659 --> 00:49:55,388
Especially the part about being a decent man.

713
00:49:55,389 --> 00:49:56,790
Gosh, that was just...

714
00:49:58,199 --> 00:49:59,699
It really touched me.

715
00:50:01,900 --> 00:50:04,299
You shouldn't sneer when an adult talks.

716
00:50:05,170 --> 00:50:06,198
Fix that.

717
00:50:06,199 --> 00:50:08,810
I also saw why Victoria Academy went under.

718
00:50:11,580 --> 00:50:14,479
There's no need to talk about what we all know.

719
00:50:14,480 --> 00:50:15,509
You don't know.

720
00:50:16,650 --> 00:50:18,178
I'm not talking about Kim Hyun Tak's plan...

721
00:50:18,179 --> 00:50:19,650
to buy your academy at a bargain price.

722
00:50:21,920 --> 00:50:25,460
Even if you were to be born again, you'd never be a good teacher.

723
00:50:26,589 --> 00:50:28,860
That's why you drove your academy to ruin.

724
00:50:29,889 --> 00:50:30,960
You really are young.

725
00:50:31,960 --> 00:50:34,329
You're talking about being a good teacher in this situation?

726
00:50:34,330 --> 00:50:37,239
"A decent man would bring his woman riches and honors."

727
00:50:38,270 --> 00:50:39,969
"Whether it means siding with the thieves,"

728
00:50:40,400 --> 00:50:43,069
"joining forces with a rat who spreads dirty rumors,"

729
00:50:43,270 --> 00:50:45,610
"or ruining the livelihoods of innocent others, do it."

730
00:50:46,940 --> 00:50:49,610
What would side with someone who talks gibberish like that?

731
00:50:51,580 --> 00:50:53,020
Nothing but dung flies.

732
00:50:56,089 --> 00:50:58,119
- Mind your manners. - Of course...

733
00:50:58,860 --> 00:51:00,689
everyone jumped ship at the first signs...

734
00:51:00,690 --> 00:51:02,560
that the academy was struggling.

735
00:51:03,429 --> 00:51:04,460
That's why you went down.

736
00:51:04,929 --> 00:51:06,000
You...

737
00:51:07,369 --> 00:51:09,730
- Can you stop using that... - I'm saying it on purpose.

738
00:51:11,600 --> 00:51:13,969
Because you'll go down in the future for the exact same reasons.

739
00:51:16,069 --> 00:51:17,139
Goodness.

740
00:51:17,779 --> 00:51:20,079
To think that the man Hye Jin ended up with...

741
00:51:20,080 --> 00:51:21,480
Is a pathetic kid.

742
00:51:23,350 --> 00:51:25,150
Is that what you said to Yoon Ji Seok too?

743
00:51:29,049 --> 00:51:31,318
I'm asking how your future...

744
00:51:31,319 --> 00:51:34,130
would benefit from people who fell for that.

745
00:51:34,929 --> 00:51:38,000
Even Myeong Jun's wondering whether or not to jump ship.

746
00:51:58,219 --> 00:51:59,949
Your emotions must be running high...

747
00:52:00,750 --> 00:52:02,549
because you're being attacked from all sides.

748
00:52:03,619 --> 00:52:06,219
You shouldn't make decisions when you're worked up.

749
00:52:06,920 --> 00:52:08,659
Okay? Go back...

750
00:52:09,389 --> 00:52:11,460
and reflect on your mistakes.

751
00:52:13,060 --> 00:52:14,069
"Reflect?"

752
00:52:15,670 --> 00:52:16,699
Me?

753
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:19,040
Goodness.

754
00:52:20,440 --> 00:52:23,569
Did I steal someone's teaching material...

755
00:52:24,040 --> 00:52:26,178
or start rumors that Woo Seung Hui's toying with younger men...

756
00:52:26,179 --> 00:52:27,350
Have you lost your mind?

757
00:52:28,310 --> 00:52:29,310
Are you offended?

758
00:52:33,920 --> 00:52:36,219
That's exactly what Ms. Seo's going through.

759
00:52:37,960 --> 00:52:39,360
Can you even imagine how it feels?

760
00:52:41,830 --> 00:52:44,759
Despite that, she's fighting not to stoop as low as you.

761
00:52:46,259 --> 00:52:49,130
That shows she is already a much better teacher than you.

762
00:52:50,699 --> 00:52:53,299
Eventually, she'll be surrounded by people, not dung flies.

763
00:52:54,739 --> 00:52:55,810
And you...

764
00:52:57,210 --> 00:52:58,480
will go down once more.

765
00:52:58,980 --> 00:52:59,980
Fine.

766
00:53:00,480 --> 00:53:02,549
Let's take this all the way.

767
00:53:02,710 --> 00:53:05,520
Some things you must experience to learn for yourself.

768
00:53:05,819 --> 00:53:08,190
You need to see what moves the world...

769
00:53:08,920 --> 00:53:10,588
the adults live in.

770
00:53:10,589 --> 00:53:13,489
Why haven't you learned anything from your experiences?

771
00:53:15,759 --> 00:53:17,230
Don't go down the same way.

772
00:53:18,199 --> 00:53:19,230
You can eat your lunch without me.

773
00:53:22,199 --> 00:53:25,040
You won't go down if you turn back now.

774
00:53:31,580 --> 00:53:33,679
Wait. Ms. Woo.

775
00:53:36,880 --> 00:53:37,880
Here.

776
00:53:39,679 --> 00:53:40,690
Don't forget this.

777
00:53:42,750 --> 00:53:44,420
You need it to look like an intellect.

778
00:53:45,759 --> 00:53:46,759
It's an important prop.

779
00:56:10,029 --> 00:56:13,940
(Vice-Director Woo Seung Hui)

780
00:56:17,270 --> 00:56:18,310
I'm in class.

781
00:56:21,679 --> 00:56:23,650
He thinks I'm stupid.

782
00:56:25,980 --> 00:56:27,049
Darn it.

783
00:56:40,560 --> 00:56:42,029
Oh, gosh.

784
00:56:45,900 --> 00:56:46,969
My goodness.

785
00:56:49,440 --> 00:56:50,469
Hey.

786
00:56:53,179 --> 00:56:54,279
Jun Ho.

787
00:56:55,750 --> 00:56:57,679
Oh, gosh. What the...

788
00:56:58,750 --> 00:56:59,819
What are you doing here?

789
00:57:01,790 --> 00:57:03,350
- Gosh. - Are you ill or something?

790
00:57:03,989 --> 00:57:05,190
No.

791
00:57:05,759 --> 00:57:09,060
I came over to take a shower.

792
00:57:09,960 --> 00:57:11,630
Why would you take a shower here?

793
00:57:12,860 --> 00:57:13,860
I'm sweating.

794
00:57:14,330 --> 00:57:15,400
What?

795
00:57:17,299 --> 00:57:18,500
You don't have a fever.

796
00:57:19,040 --> 00:57:20,540
I have my reasons.

797
00:57:21,770 --> 00:57:23,670
I'll wash up.

798
00:57:23,770 --> 00:57:24,779
Okay.

799
00:57:27,139 --> 00:57:28,210
Oh, dear...

800
00:57:38,819 --> 00:57:39,819
Bye.

801
00:57:40,520 --> 00:57:42,130
You're leaving already? Without dinner?

802
00:57:43,159 --> 00:57:44,400
I have to go. It was a short visit.

803
00:57:46,199 --> 00:57:47,259
Sit down.

804
00:57:47,360 --> 00:57:48,900
I don't have the time. I have to go.

805
00:57:52,699 --> 00:57:53,799
Must you do this?

806
00:57:54,739 --> 00:57:58,009
Do you want me to visit Hye Jin and throw things around?

807
00:57:58,839 --> 00:57:59,839
Why...

808
00:58:02,580 --> 00:58:03,650
Leave.

809
00:58:06,020 --> 00:58:07,049
Mom.

810
00:58:07,819 --> 00:58:10,250
You said you had no time. Go.

811
00:58:21,630 --> 00:58:22,630
What's going on?

812
00:58:23,770 --> 00:58:25,500
I heard there are lots of good movies out.

813
00:58:26,799 --> 00:58:28,339
Let's watch one on my day off.

814
00:58:30,670 --> 00:58:33,179
I'll treat you to the hotel brunch you like too.

815
00:58:34,009 --> 00:58:35,009
What?

816
00:58:35,449 --> 00:58:37,178
And in the evening, we'll eat what you cook...

817
00:58:37,179 --> 00:58:39,350
and watch TV together. And then I'll stay the night.

818
00:58:40,549 --> 00:58:42,290
I'll wash the bean sprouts with you...

819
00:58:43,150 --> 00:58:44,219
and take you on a walk.

820
00:58:46,719 --> 00:58:49,929
I know you want to spend time and chat with me.

821
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:53,630
Sorry for being a jerk.

822
00:58:55,600 --> 00:58:57,130
What trick is this?

823
00:58:57,270 --> 00:58:58,500
It's not a trick.

824
00:58:59,139 --> 00:59:00,199
I want to do all that.

825
00:59:00,799 --> 00:59:01,810
As if you do.

826
00:59:05,710 --> 00:59:07,949
- But Mom. - What?

827
00:59:08,409 --> 00:59:10,250
Ms. Seo taught me all that.

828
00:59:11,380 --> 00:59:12,679
Darn you.

829
00:59:13,920 --> 00:59:15,049
Be generous with her.

830
00:59:15,319 --> 00:59:16,349
- You... - Okay.

831
00:59:16,350 --> 00:59:18,988
- I didn't hit you enough last time. - Okay.

832
00:59:18,989 --> 00:59:21,290
My goodness. You really...

833
00:59:35,940 --> 00:59:37,270
You'll eat all this?

834
00:59:38,110 --> 00:59:39,409
I missed lunch.

835
00:59:43,850 --> 00:59:45,580
Woo Seung Hui didn't buy you lunch?

836
00:59:45,819 --> 00:59:48,190
We made each other lose their appetites.

837
00:59:52,420 --> 00:59:53,460
But...

838
00:59:54,219 --> 00:59:57,060
What did you talk about that made you skip lunch?

839
00:59:58,199 --> 00:59:59,960
I told her I saw why her academy went down...

840
01:00:00,560 --> 01:00:01,670
and that she'd go down again.

841
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:03,029
What?

842
01:00:06,770 --> 01:00:09,869
I was going to be polite, but I changed my mind halfway.

843
01:00:10,810 --> 01:00:11,839
Why?

844
01:00:15,350 --> 01:00:17,580
Because she looked smug.

845
01:00:22,589 --> 01:00:25,690
I get that crushing us would make them feel good.

846
01:00:26,489 --> 01:00:28,730
Studying is boring, and the future is bleak.

847
01:00:29,360 --> 01:00:30,659
They don't care about the truth.

848
01:00:31,100 --> 01:00:32,900
Even less about the morals of academy instructors.

849
01:00:34,529 --> 01:00:37,799
They like enjoying the provocative and dirty nature of all this.

850
01:00:38,940 --> 01:00:41,210
How thrilling is it to watch someone successful go down?

851
01:00:41,839 --> 01:00:42,869
That hurts.

852
01:00:43,969 --> 01:00:45,409
Be gentle.

853
01:00:45,940 --> 01:00:46,940
Sorry.

854
01:00:49,949 --> 01:00:51,380
But Woo Seung Hui shouldn't do that.

855
01:00:53,179 --> 01:00:55,219
She shouldn't smile as she tries to buy people.

856
01:01:00,360 --> 01:01:03,029
In time, everyone will forget about us.

857
01:01:03,730 --> 01:01:05,759
Moms will start sending their kids back to us.

858
01:01:06,560 --> 01:01:08,770
They think they have the right to talk...

859
01:01:09,000 --> 01:01:10,029
because they pay.

860
01:01:11,199 --> 01:01:12,369
"I crushed you,"

861
01:01:13,469 --> 01:01:15,170
"but you can't ignore my demands."

862
01:01:15,909 --> 01:01:18,439
Yes. Like you said, in time...

863
01:01:18,440 --> 01:01:19,839
I don't plan to just wait...

864
01:01:20,040 --> 01:01:21,449
until time passes.

865
01:01:24,009 --> 01:01:27,480
I'll prove how clean and exact a person...

866
01:01:28,250 --> 01:01:29,290
you really are.

867
01:01:41,630 --> 01:01:43,670
What about the Gangnam building you want to buy?

868
01:01:45,270 --> 01:01:47,299
Hasn't your goal become a bit too shabby?

869
01:01:47,839 --> 01:01:49,769
A man who can't keep his relationship on track...

870
01:01:49,770 --> 01:01:52,409
can't own a building, let alone a studio apartment.

871
01:01:55,509 --> 01:01:56,580
How can I help?

872
01:02:02,420 --> 01:02:04,719
Finish this.

873
01:02:06,520 --> 01:02:07,560
And?

874
01:02:08,560 --> 01:02:09,759
Let me finish this.

875
01:02:10,759 --> 01:02:11,799
Okay.

876
01:02:29,850 --> 01:02:31,580
- Did I get it on me again? - Yes, and on your first bite.

877
01:02:38,819 --> 01:02:40,119
Why does this make my heart race?

878
01:02:45,630 --> 01:02:46,630
I let you off.

879
01:02:47,860 --> 01:02:50,969
I was going to hold a grudge against you for running away last time.

880
01:03:02,810 --> 01:03:05,380
I'll drop by the bookstore to get some stuff I checked out.

881
01:03:07,250 --> 01:03:08,319
See you.

882
01:03:37,279 --> 01:03:38,650
It's a great layout for its size.

883
01:03:39,219 --> 01:03:42,619
The previous tenant kept it so clean.

884
01:03:43,250 --> 01:03:45,619
It's in incredible condition.

885
01:04:39,940 --> 01:04:42,350
Is my academy involved in this incident?

886
01:04:46,549 --> 01:04:49,650
Ms. Seo is a woman, so...

887
01:04:51,619 --> 01:04:54,790
You felt uncomfortable asking her about it.

888
01:04:55,589 --> 01:04:56,929
Because the words going around are smutty.

889
01:05:01,529 --> 01:05:03,369
Did Director Choi say she wasn't involved?

890
01:05:05,199 --> 01:05:06,540
She won't take questions.

891
01:05:07,239 --> 01:05:08,440
She said she had no intention of sharing...

892
01:05:08,710 --> 01:05:10,139
how she runs her business.

893
01:05:14,639 --> 01:05:16,909
When you said you'd join Choisun Academy,

894
01:05:18,580 --> 01:05:20,449
Ms. Seo once told me...

895
01:05:22,489 --> 01:05:25,960
that she would let you take her students if she could.

896
01:05:28,489 --> 01:05:30,330
She hates Choi Hyung Sun,

897
01:05:30,960 --> 01:05:33,000
but she was relieved that the students have you...

898
01:05:33,630 --> 01:05:34,630
to learn from.

899
01:05:36,069 --> 01:05:38,139
I bet that's how Ms. Seo feels.

900
01:05:41,739 --> 01:05:42,810
That makes no sense.

901
01:05:43,409 --> 01:05:46,380
Those students must mean everything to her.

902
01:05:47,440 --> 01:05:48,549
Don't worry.

903
01:05:49,110 --> 01:05:51,080
She's thinking like crazy of a way to bring them back.

904
01:06:03,730 --> 01:06:04,799
It's nothing.

905
01:06:05,500 --> 01:06:06,730
You should get back to your class.

906
01:06:07,960 --> 01:06:09,699
- Yes. - Bye, then.

907
01:06:26,380 --> 01:06:27,380
Min Ji.

908
01:06:27,850 --> 01:06:29,850
Can I take a yellow chalk?

909
01:06:33,719 --> 01:06:36,060
- Mine hasn't arrived yet. - You can't.

910
01:06:37,630 --> 01:06:39,798
You have two.

911
01:06:39,799 --> 01:06:41,400
We need a lot of yellow today.

912
01:06:42,429 --> 01:06:43,869
You're not the teacher.

913
01:06:44,029 --> 01:06:45,699
I can tell by what section she'll teach.

914
01:06:47,469 --> 01:06:48,710
Then what about purple?

915
01:06:50,469 --> 01:06:51,480
No.

916
01:06:53,210 --> 01:06:54,739
I keep a special ledger for this.

917
01:06:57,310 --> 01:06:58,318
A ledger?

918
01:06:58,319 --> 01:07:01,549
I took note of all the times you took Ms. Seo's chalks.

919
01:07:01,750 --> 01:07:03,250
You took just the expensive ones.

920
01:07:04,619 --> 01:07:06,060
When did I just take the expensive...

921
01:07:08,460 --> 01:07:10,859
Did Hye Jin ask you to keep track of her chalk?

922
01:07:10,860 --> 01:07:12,758
No, but if you take any more,

923
01:07:12,759 --> 01:07:14,500
I will start telling her.

924
01:07:15,529 --> 01:07:17,368
Min Ji. We're all family...

925
01:07:17,369 --> 01:07:19,440
- Hi. - Hello.

926
01:07:21,739 --> 01:07:23,738
Okay, Min Ji. I'll let you work.

927
01:07:23,739 --> 01:07:25,310
- Bye. - Hello.

928
01:07:26,380 --> 01:07:27,710
- Ms. Choi. - Yes?

929
01:07:28,779 --> 01:07:30,549
I forgot to bring my textbook.

930
01:07:30,949 --> 01:07:32,020
Goodness.

931
01:07:34,150 --> 01:07:35,150
Here.

932
01:07:36,449 --> 01:07:38,360
Oh, thank you.

933
01:07:38,819 --> 01:07:40,460
- Don't forget it next time. - Okay.

936
01:07:59,610 --> 01:08:01,679
A full barn is what makes people generous.

937
01:08:03,080 --> 01:08:05,179
Even if it looks fine on the outside,

938
01:08:05,750 --> 01:08:08,389
you can tell on the inside when a house...

939
01:08:09,089 --> 01:08:10,190
is about to go down.

940
01:08:11,520 --> 01:08:12,619
What do you mean?

941
01:08:14,259 --> 01:08:16,389
What? It's nothing.

942
01:08:21,770 --> 01:08:23,700
Why would she get so stingy over a piece of chalk?

943

(Field Assistant)

944
01:08:36,910 --> 01:08:38,079
Hello, Ms. Woo.

945
01:08:38,780 --> 01:08:41,150
Hi, Min Ji.

946
01:08:42,219 --> 01:08:43,350
It's been a while.

947
01:08:44,889 --> 01:08:47,289
There's an opening in Mok-dong.

948
01:08:47,589 --> 01:08:48,789
I'm thinking of going there.

949
01:08:49,129 --> 01:08:50,160
Mok-dong?

950
01:08:51,230 --> 01:08:52,259
That's a nice place too.

951
01:08:52,860 --> 01:08:54,700
But why not go with Woo Seung Hui?

952
01:08:56,030 --> 01:08:57,829
I'm going to keep my options open.

953
01:08:59,169 --> 01:09:00,200
What about you?

954
01:09:03,410 --> 01:09:05,639
I'm going to talk to the director first.

955
01:09:08,249 --> 01:09:09,780
I'm a team leader,

956
01:09:10,079 --> 01:09:11,379
so I feel bad to jump at the first offer.

957
01:09:16,289 --> 01:09:18,249
Isn't today Ms. Kim's day off?

958
01:09:18,490 --> 01:09:19,490
It is.

959
01:09:22,459 --> 01:09:25,530
She had no intention of sharing how she runs her business.

960
01:09:33,139 --> 01:09:35,139
I'd like you to think about it carefully.

961
01:09:39,839 --> 01:09:43,008
The consultants say your classes are still stable...

962
01:09:43,009 --> 01:09:45,850
I'll teach until the end of this month.

963
01:09:49,950 --> 01:09:52,490
The director is looking for a solution too.

964
01:09:53,060 --> 01:09:55,160
I didn't make the decision flippantly.

965
01:09:56,360 --> 01:09:57,429
Sorry.

966
01:10:02,370 --> 01:10:03,429
I just...

967
01:10:04,799 --> 01:10:06,400
want to treat you to a meal.

968
01:10:07,240 --> 01:10:08,669
Would that be too uncomfortable?

969
01:10:10,839 --> 01:10:12,079
Did Ms. Woo...

970
01:10:13,310 --> 01:10:14,940
Did she promise you something?

971
01:10:16,280 --> 01:10:18,549
- What do you mean? - Did she say...

972
01:10:19,049 --> 01:10:20,549
she could give you...

973
01:10:22,719 --> 01:10:24,089
my teaching materials?

974
01:10:26,860 --> 01:10:27,919
Did she say...

975
01:10:30,530 --> 01:10:33,400
I wasn't just going down, but that I was crashing and burning?

976
01:10:34,329 --> 01:10:36,329
- Well... - Did she say...

977
01:10:37,230 --> 01:10:39,570
there's really not one ounce of hope...

978
01:10:40,200 --> 01:10:41,270
left for this academy?

979
01:10:43,539 --> 01:10:44,539
Yes.

980
01:10:47,110 --> 01:10:49,780
She said we should all escape soon.

01:11:36,660 --> 01:11:39,230
You're going through the worst time of your life.

984
01:11:39,360 --> 01:11:42,329
There's a part-time opening that provides a scholarship.

985
01:11:42,429 --> 01:11:43,469
Do you want to go?

986
01:11:43,929 --> 01:11:44,929
I was crazy.

987
01:11:45,799 --> 01:11:46,999
I was out of it.

988
01:11:47,240 --> 01:11:49,469
What Choi Hyung Sun really wants is Seo Hye Jin.

989
01:11:50,039 --> 01:11:51,780
Is that your idea, Myeong Jun?

990
01:11:52,539 --> 01:11:53,910

993

How am I going to stay with you...

994
01:11:59,919 --> 01:12:00,919
for the rest of my life if you're like this?

995
01:12:00,920 --> 01:12:02,889
