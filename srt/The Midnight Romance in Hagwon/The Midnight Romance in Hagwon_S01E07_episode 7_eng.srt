You'll catch a cold.

31
00:02:28,050 --> 00:02:31,370
- I don't care.
 - No, I care.

32
00:02:31,370 --> 00:02:34,940
Throat... Your throat is so important.

33
00:02:34,940 --> 00:02:37,340
I think you misunderstood what I said.

34
00:02:37,340 --> 00:02:40,050
I said I don't want to go back because

35
00:02:40,050 --> 00:02:42,530
I was opposed to you joining the academy,

36
00:02:42,530 --> 00:02:45,230
but you were adjusting better than I thought.

37
00:02:45,230 --> 00:02:47,490
So I wanted to influence...

38
00:02:47,490 --> 00:02:49,720
- influence you positively— 
 - Ms. Seo,

39
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:52,890
I think you're the one who misunderstood.

40
00:02:52,890 --> 00:02:54,440
What?

41
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:56,790
I just confessed my love.

42
00:03:02,020 --> 00:03:03,350
D-Dry your clothes first.

43
00:03:03,350 --> 00:03:07,330
The lecture is coming up. If you catch a cold... I beg you.

44
00:03:07,330 --> 00:03:09,160
Dry your clothes first.

Team Leader never came.

49
00:03:35,950 --> 00:03:38,570
She got trapped, you know.

I can't get a driver.

51
00:03:41,580 --> 00:03:43,810
Maybe something happened.

52
00:03:43,810 --> 00:03:47,240
No way. Mr. Lee is there. It should be fine.

53
00:03:50,570 --> 00:03:54,210
Should we drink the imported liquor in the director's office?

54
00:03:54,210 --> 00:03:55,930
Well, what do you call it?

55
00:03:55,930 --> 00:03:59,520
He has the single whatever there.

58
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:54,200
I'm sorry I'm leaving.

59
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:56,150
Don't worry, and get going.

60
00:04:56,150 --> 00:04:58,410
- I'm sorry.
 - Get home safely. Bye.

61
00:04:58,410 --> 00:05:01,330
No, no. Don't be like that.

62
00:05:01,330 --> 00:05:02,920
I'll take a detour and drop you off.

63
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:05,210
- Hold on. 
- No, no.

64
00:05:05,210 --> 00:05:06,920
I'm sorry. We need to go now.

65
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:08,170
It's okay. Get going.

66
00:05:08,170 --> 00:05:10,690
- I'm sorry.
- No worries. Bye.

67
00:05:16,100 --> 00:05:20,900
The taxi fare is so expensive. I'd have to be crazy.

68
00:05:26,340 --> 00:05:29,720
 No matter how much I think about it, there's no way you didn't know... 

69
00:05:31,210 --> 00:05:33,510
 that Lee Joon Ho's first love was... 

70
00:05:34,810 --> 00:05:36,710
 Seo Hye Jin. 

71
00:05:52,940 --> 00:05:54,770
I'm crazy.

72
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:26,470
What are you doing here?

73
00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:37,160
M-Ms. Nam, what are you doing here at this hour?

74
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:41,940
How about you? I thought you were meeting the Director.

75
00:06:45,380 --> 00:06:47,980
- Is this—
 - No, no.

76
00:06:47,980 --> 00:06:49,610
It's mine.

77
00:06:49,610 --> 00:06:51,080
It's mine.

78
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:53,750
Gosh, you scared me.

79
00:06:56,790 --> 00:07:02,160
I exploded on the Director regarding the Chanyeong class.

80
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:06,960
He got emotional because I demanded an apology.

81
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:09,570
He jumped into the water, refusing to apologize?

82
00:07:09,570 --> 00:07:11,070
No, no. It's not that.

83
00:07:11,070 --> 00:07:14,790
He just missed his footing.

84
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:19,480
They've been having a beef over the Chanyeong High class.

85
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:22,420
I was just going to observe on the side,

86
00:07:22,420 --> 00:07:28,280
but the Director held onto me as he lost his footing.

87
00:07:30,670 --> 00:07:36,830
It sounds right, but also not quite.

88
00:07:36,830 --> 00:07:39,340
Ask Director. He'll tell you the exact same thing.

89
00:07:39,340 --> 00:07:41,810
Why would I ask about something like that?

90
00:07:41,810 --> 00:07:43,540
I'll just believe you.

91
00:07:43,540 --> 00:07:45,650
It's not like I saw anything improper.

92
00:07:45,650 --> 00:07:48,880
Even so, others' romance is none of my business, either.

93
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:52,430
No. What do you mean, romance?

94
00:07:52,430 --> 00:07:53,940
It's not like that.

95
00:07:53,940 --> 00:07:57,010
I said I believe you.

96
00:07:57,010 --> 00:08:00,860
By the way, why are you here at this hour? It's very late.

97
00:08:00,860 --> 00:08:04,750
Oh, me? I couldn't get a taxi.

98
00:08:07,960 --> 00:08:09,810
That was a lie.

99
00:08:09,810 --> 00:08:13,470
I came to wait for the first morning bus so I don't spend money on a taxi.

100
00:08:13,470 --> 00:08:16,470
The sofa in the director's office looked nice.

101
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:22,120
Come to my place if you don't mind.

102
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:23,600
To your place?

103
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:25,750
I was going to call a taxi, anyway.

104
00:08:25,750 --> 00:08:29,170
I can't just let you sleep here.

105
00:08:29,170 --> 00:08:30,710
It's okay.

106
00:08:30,710 --> 00:08:33,550
I'll just wait until the buses start running.

107
00:08:33,550 --> 00:08:35,750
But I'd feel bad.

108
00:08:36,820 --> 00:08:37,980
How about your family?

109
00:08:37,980 --> 00:08:39,770
I live alone.

110
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:42,450
Won't I be inconveniencing you?

111
00:08:42,450 --> 00:08:44,940
No, not at all.

112
00:08:44,940 --> 00:08:47,070
I'll actually inconvenience you then.

113
00:08:47,070 --> 00:08:49,290
You won't be inconveniencing me.

114
00:08:50,090 --> 00:08:52,110
I'll grab my toothpaste and stuff, then.

115
00:08:52,110 --> 00:08:53,690
Okay.

116
00:08:55,940 --> 00:08:58,960
You should get dressed, too. Your clothes are all dry.

117
00:09:00,660 --> 00:09:02,520
What?

118
00:09:02,520 --> 00:09:04,190
We're not done talking yet.

119
00:09:04,190 --> 00:09:06,850
-  I explained it to you wrong. 
- What are you talking about?

120
00:09:06,850 --> 00:09:08,670
By the way...

121
00:09:11,060 --> 00:09:13,510
- Yes? 
- Why are you so surprised?

122
00:09:13,510 --> 00:09:16,610
No, what is it?

123
00:09:16,610 --> 00:09:22,780
Have you two been alone at the academy before, by chance?

124
00:09:29,260 --> 00:09:30,350
Why do you suddenly ask that?

125
00:09:30,350 --> 00:09:34,470
I feel like this happened once before.

126
00:09:34,470 --> 00:09:37,500
Yes, when we were preparing for the joint lecture.

127
00:09:38,520 --> 00:09:40,160
I'll go get my stuff.

128
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:02,440
Get home safely.

129
00:10:03,640 --> 00:10:05,400
I'll call you.

130
00:10:53,590 --> 00:10:55,610
Geez. Cold...

131
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,760
So cold.

132
00:11:23,350 --> 00:11:26,560
We should've stopped by a convenience store. I have nothing to offer you.

133
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:28,330
I said it's okay.

134
00:11:28,330 --> 00:11:29,700
Water is enough.

135
00:11:29,700 --> 00:11:33,590
Right. I have beer and coffee.

136
00:11:33,590 --> 00:11:35,680
Of course, I'll take beer.

137
00:11:41,150 --> 00:11:43,640
Your place is so nice.

138
00:11:44,250 --> 00:11:45,820
The suffering starts now.

139
00:11:45,820 --> 00:11:49,400
It's cold in winter because it's an old building.

140
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:52,250
The pipes are old, apparently.

141
00:11:52,250 --> 00:11:54,680
All this needs to be ripped out at some point.

142
00:11:54,680 --> 00:11:57,830
But I'm staying cold since I don't have time to fix it.

143
00:11:57,830 --> 00:12:02,120
I still live in a studio. I've been saving a lot of money

144
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:04,720
so I can move into an apartment building one day.

145
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:08,070
Choose a new building instead of an old one like this.

146
00:12:08,070 --> 00:12:09,570
Of course.

147
00:12:09,570 --> 00:12:13,790
I may not look like it, but I started a time deposit account when I was 20.

148
00:12:37,390 --> 00:12:40,150
 I think my phone broke when I fell in the water. 

149
00:12:40,150 --> 00:12:42,300
 I'll be in touch tomorrow. 

150
00:12:56,520 --> 00:13:00,700
 I won't wait for your response since I know it's hard to respond now. 

151
00:13:02,290 --> 00:13:08,120
 I wish we got to talk a bit longer, but we have a lot of time. 

152
00:13:12,740 --> 00:13:18,630
 I don't care if you go to Choeseon Korean or the moon anymore. 

153
00:13:18,630 --> 00:13:20,250
 Good night. 

154
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:39,520
I hate secrets,

155
00:13:40,990 --> 00:13:44,320
but I won't tell anyone what I saw today.

156
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:47,080
I think I should, for some reason.

157
00:13:48,860 --> 00:13:50,900
Thank you, Ms. Nam.

158
00:13:52,170 --> 00:13:55,730
I hope you talk less formally.

159
00:14:01,270 --> 00:14:03,650
Thanks.

160
00:14:03,650 --> 00:14:08,650
Instead, don't tell anyone I went back to the academy

161
00:14:08,650 --> 00:14:11,240
instead of getting a taxi.

162
00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:13,470
It'll make me look pathetic.

163
00:14:14,710 --> 00:14:17,010
I won't tell anyone.

164
00:14:17,010 --> 00:14:18,910
Okay.

165
00:14:21,950 --> 00:14:24,230
I'll go to sleep now.

166
00:14:24,230 --> 00:14:25,910
Okay.

167
00:15:08,500 --> 00:15:12,680
 Mr. Lee Joon Ho 

168
00:15:14,020 --> 00:15:16,040
Lee Jun Ho.

169
00:15:16,840 --> 00:15:19,450
Lee Jun Ho is a teacher.

170
00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:14,260
Yes, Assistant Director.

171
00:16:14,260 --> 00:16:19,450
Hi. I hope I didn't call you too early.

172
00:16:20,330 --> 00:16:23,240
Well, the thing is...

173
00:16:23,240 --> 00:16:27,940
did you meet the Director last night?

174
00:16:29,460 --> 00:16:33,450
Really? What time was that?

175
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:37,840
No, it's nothing serious.

176
00:16:37,840 --> 00:16:41,300
He has a lot to sign off on today but skipped the support team meeting.

177
00:16:41,300 --> 00:16:43,530
We can't get a hold of him, either.

178
00:17:06,690 --> 00:17:12,440
911. 911. 911...

179
00:17:36,440 --> 00:17:39,280
No.

180
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:04,160
- Team Leader.
 - You came early.

181
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:07,550
I'm sorry. I didn't want to go alone since the Director lives alone.

182
00:18:07,550 --> 00:18:09,420
No, you did the right thing.

183
00:18:09,420 --> 00:18:11,730
You did. Let's go.

184
00:18:18,870 --> 00:18:23,090
Director, this is Team Leader Yun.

185
00:18:27,730 --> 00:18:31,090
Director, this is Team Leader Yun. Are you in there?

186
00:18:34,550 --> 00:18:36,490
Director!

187
00:18:39,660 --> 00:18:40,890
Director!

188
00:18:40,890 --> 00:18:43,010
Coming.

189
00:18:46,780 --> 00:18:48,830
Are you in there?

190
00:18:51,570 --> 00:18:53,730
Gosh, I made it.

191
00:18:57,740 --> 00:19:00,830
Hey, come on in.

192
00:19:00,830 --> 00:19:03,880
Hold on a second. I'll let you in soon.

193
00:19:26,470 --> 00:19:29,800
It's me, Ms. Seo. You haven't left for work yet, right?

194
00:19:29,800 --> 00:19:31,310
I'll meet you over there.

195
00:19:31,310 --> 00:19:34,110
Let's have lunch together and go to work—

196
00:19:35,850 --> 00:19:37,390
Pardon?

197
00:19:37,390 --> 00:19:40,090
I'm out now. I'm busy.

198
00:19:42,190 --> 00:19:45,470
- Come on in.
 - Yes, I'll call you back.

199
00:19:58,110 --> 00:20:00,000
Yes, Assistant Director.

200
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:06,060
Yes, it looks like he's very sick.

201
00:20:06,060 --> 00:20:08,690
No, with Team Leader Yun.

202
00:20:08,690 --> 00:20:11,810
Yes, at the housewarming party.

203
00:20:11,810 --> 00:20:17,090
Yes. We'll see how he does first and take him to the hospital or something.

204
00:20:22,040 --> 00:20:24,230
Can you go out to take a taxi?

205
00:20:24,230 --> 00:20:25,670
No.

206
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:29,350
- Should I call an ambulance?
 - No.

207
00:20:36,180 --> 00:20:38,090
Geez.

208
00:20:39,040 --> 00:20:41,270
Where's the emergency kit?

209
00:20:42,610 --> 00:20:44,100
Study...

210
00:20:44,100 --> 00:20:45,850
Pardon? Gosh. Whoa.

211
00:20:45,850 --> 00:20:47,670
Whoa.

212
00:20:47,670 --> 00:20:50,150
Whoa, the alcohol smell.

213
00:20:50,150 --> 00:20:52,310
Is this a fever or hangover?

214
00:20:53,210 --> 00:20:55,630
Both.

215
00:20:55,630 --> 00:20:58,320
Okay, then. Bye.

216
00:21:00,310 --> 00:21:03,410
Is he not feeling well?

217
00:21:05,040 --> 00:21:06,720
No.

218
00:21:07,980 --> 00:21:11,110
I'll get them approved later.

219
00:21:11,110 --> 00:21:16,680
Process the documents that need to be sent out today.

220
00:21:16,680 --> 00:21:18,310
Okay.

221
00:21:18,310 --> 00:21:22,620
Bring me Ms. Seo's contract, too.

222
00:21:25,570 --> 00:21:28,050
What are you doing?

223
00:21:28,050 --> 00:21:30,340
Okay, I will.

224
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:43,400
I contacted all the mothers who came to the Chanyeong orientation.

225
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:46,250
They were very impressed

226
00:21:46,250 --> 00:21:50,290
with your leadership and lecturing skills.

227
00:21:50,290 --> 00:21:52,450
Just tell me.

228
00:21:53,150 --> 00:21:55,260
A lot of them said

229
00:21:55,260 --> 00:22:00,700
they didn't want to change the class schedule.

230
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:07,910
Daechi Chase got us big time.

231
00:22:08,710 --> 00:22:14,000
Not a bad number of them clearly said they'd enroll for the class,

232
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:17,750
but it's not quite enough for you to start a class.

233
00:22:17,750 --> 00:22:20,580
Which of these students has the best grade?

234
00:22:20,580 --> 00:22:24,620
W-Well, her name is Byeon-Byeon Ah Jeong.

235
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:29,580
She got rank 2 in the mock test in March.

236
00:22:29,580 --> 00:22:33,240
She got rank 4 in the previous midterm.

237
00:22:33,240 --> 00:22:35,880
She tends to do worse on school exams.

238
00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:43,440
Have you heard back regarding the contract yet?

239
00:22:44,440 --> 00:22:46,420
She can't reject it.

240
00:22:46,420 --> 00:22:49,000
The conditions are perfect.

241
00:22:51,170 --> 00:22:55,430
You live alone, yet you don't have any emergency medicine. What's the deal?

242
00:22:55,430 --> 00:22:58,310
You're bothering the poor team leader instead.

243
00:23:01,550 --> 00:23:03,120
I'm sorry.

244
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:06,360
You shouldn't apologize to me.

245
00:23:06,360 --> 00:23:08,470
It's not that.

246
00:23:08,470 --> 00:23:12,220
I'm apologizing sincerely.

247
00:23:12,220 --> 00:23:14,070
What I didn't get to last night.

248
00:23:14,070 --> 00:23:16,140
Don't worry about that.

249
00:23:18,280 --> 00:23:22,840
I was so sick late last night.

250
00:23:22,840 --> 00:23:26,170
I thought I was actually dying.

251
00:23:26,870 --> 00:23:29,890
As I thought I was dying,

252
00:23:29,890 --> 00:23:34,370
I was worried about these three things.

253
00:23:37,960 --> 00:23:40,420
You need to ask me what they are.

254
00:23:41,700 --> 00:23:43,620
What are they?

255
00:23:43,620 --> 00:23:47,800
The first thing was the script.

256
00:23:48,600 --> 00:23:51,920
I put it in the drawer because it sucked,

257
00:23:52,970 --> 00:23:57,090
but I need to burn it before I die so no one sees it.

258
00:23:57,880 --> 00:23:59,800
The second thing was...

259
00:24:01,330 --> 00:24:07,170
my parents who love to worry about their single son.

260
00:24:09,150 --> 00:24:12,100
And the last thing was you.

261
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:15,240
Am I allowed to be on that list?

262
00:24:18,840 --> 00:24:23,350
I know you were very disappointed in me.

263
00:24:25,130 --> 00:24:29,810
You said I didn't just cancel the Chanyeong class

264
00:24:30,420 --> 00:24:33,480
but broke our trust.

265
00:24:34,590 --> 00:24:37,070
That really broke my heart.

266
00:24:40,660 --> 00:24:42,620
Even if you...

267
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:46,870
looked for another job because of what happened,

268
00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:52,380
I'll accept it.

269
00:24:53,490 --> 00:24:56,900
Although I'd be thankful if you don't.

270
00:24:58,100 --> 00:24:59,990
How shameless, right?

271
00:25:07,250 --> 00:25:08,970
Drink this.

272
00:25:12,850 --> 00:25:14,870
What's wrong with you?

273
00:25:16,250 --> 00:25:18,570
We need to check other students' notes, too.

274
00:25:18,570 --> 00:25:19,980
Okay.

275
00:25:19,980 --> 00:25:22,320
I saw this type of question in the Huiwon High exam book. I'll make a copy.

276
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:24,070
Okay.

277
00:25:28,340 --> 00:25:31,740
 Print 

278
00:25:31,740 --> 00:25:34,200
 Printing 

279
00:25:54,630 --> 00:25:57,600
 Ms. Seo, when will you be here? 

280
00:26:00,060 --> 00:26:04,680
Oh, right. I got a job offer from Choeseon Korean.

281
00:26:04,680 --> 00:26:07,840
What did you say? I couldn't hear well because of the sound of the water.

282
00:26:07,840 --> 00:26:10,250
Choeseon Korean asked me to join them.

283
00:26:10,250 --> 00:26:12,870
So, I basically decided to.

284
00:26:12,870 --> 00:26:18,650
The problem is that my contract says I can't get a job nearby for a year.

285
00:26:18,650 --> 00:26:22,550
But Choeseon Korean said they'd take care of that, too.

286
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:27,630
Well, hold on.

287
00:26:27,630 --> 00:26:30,510
Hot. It's okay. It's okay.

288
00:26:31,150 --> 00:26:32,730
Thank you.

289
00:27:01,460 --> 00:27:03,280
 That's great. 

290
00:27:05,010 --> 00:27:08,400
The academy will be seriously affected

291
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:11,470
and he'll be shocked, too,

292
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:14,180
but it's good for your career.

293
00:27:14,180 --> 00:27:16,600
You've been loyal enough, too.

294
00:27:17,640 --> 00:27:19,480
I knew it.

295
00:27:20,920 --> 00:27:24,280
I knew you'd say that, Team Leader Yun.

296
00:27:24,280 --> 00:27:26,810
Will you quit after the finals, then?

297
00:27:27,610 --> 00:27:29,380
Probably?

298
00:27:30,510 --> 00:27:33,760
We'll still hang out even after you quit, right?

299
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:35,540
Of course.

300
00:27:35,540 --> 00:27:37,150
Congratulations.

301
00:27:41,330 --> 00:27:43,230
Mr. Lee, there you were.

302
00:27:43,230 --> 00:27:44,980
Yes.

303
00:27:45,790 --> 00:27:49,350
I'm sorry. This will take a while.

304
00:27:49,350 --> 00:27:51,500
I can just wait.

305
00:27:54,450 --> 00:27:57,840
Why didn't you come back last night?

306
00:27:58,770 --> 00:28:00,350
During the team dinner.

307
00:28:01,730 --> 00:28:05,080
Oh, something had come up after.

308
00:28:05,080 --> 00:28:09,600
I'm disappointed that you always leave like that.

309
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:12,010
Can't believe I disappointed my senior.

310
00:28:12,010 --> 00:28:14,800
I made a mistake as your junior.

311
00:28:16,340 --> 00:28:18,780
Why don't you buy me a meal, then?

312
00:28:19,610 --> 00:28:20,830
Pardon?

313
00:28:20,830 --> 00:28:24,940
What? Is there a reason why you can't eat with me?

314
00:28:24,940 --> 00:28:28,050
Do you have a girlfriend or...

315
00:28:32,200 --> 00:28:34,710
There is someone I like.

316
00:28:34,710 --> 00:28:36,800
She's not my girlfriend yet.

317
00:28:38,200 --> 00:28:39,610
So...

318
00:28:43,520 --> 00:28:45,280
This is done.

319
00:28:53,170 --> 00:28:57,490
Does your fling not like you eating out with your colleague?

320
00:28:58,730 --> 00:29:00,910
She probably doesn't care.

321
00:29:00,910 --> 00:29:02,990
Buy me a meal, then.

322
00:29:09,740 --> 00:29:11,500
Fling?

323
00:29:15,030 --> 00:29:16,820
Fling?

324
00:29:38,780 --> 00:29:42,300
By the way, Jun Ho will be disappointed.

325
00:29:44,500 --> 00:29:46,830
He likes you a lot.

326
00:29:46,830 --> 00:29:49,600
You two got the Huiwon High class together, too.

327
00:29:51,420 --> 00:29:57,180
 I don't care if you go to Choeseon Korean or the moon anymore. 

328
00:29:57,180 --> 00:29:59,460
He doesn't care, apparently.

329
00:29:59,460 --> 00:30:01,890
Did you tell him already?

330
00:30:01,890 --> 00:30:06,270
He had to know first. Because Huiwon High is at stake.

331
00:30:06,270 --> 00:30:11,240
You're right. Huiwon High is at stake.

332
00:30:11,240 --> 00:30:13,410
- Sorry, we're late.
 - Hello.

333
00:30:13,410 --> 00:30:15,280
Hello.

334
00:30:23,030 --> 00:30:24,660
Is the Director very sick?

335
00:30:24,660 --> 00:30:28,830
Yes, kind of. How did you know, by the way?

336
00:30:28,830 --> 00:30:32,940
If Team Leader Choi knows, the entire world knows.

337
00:30:35,180 --> 00:30:37,950
Should we have a meeting in 10 minutes since our entire team is here?

338
00:30:37,950 --> 00:30:39,990
Okay.

339
00:30:43,650 --> 00:30:45,210
Breaking news.

340
00:30:45,210 --> 00:30:47,330
It better be something serious.

341
00:30:47,330 --> 00:30:49,390
Seo Hye Jin...

342
00:30:50,100 --> 00:30:52,300
might end up quitting.

343
00:30:52,300 --> 00:30:53,490
What?

344
00:30:53,490 --> 00:30:57,140
The Assistant Director told me to bring her contract.

345
00:30:57,140 --> 00:30:58,290
Are you sure?

346
00:30:58,290 --> 00:31:01,870
The Director is sick, and the Assistant Director is totally down.

347
00:31:01,870 --> 00:31:05,890
It's not for certain, but isn't it so suspicious?

348
00:31:05,890 --> 00:31:07,890
No, it can't be.

349
00:31:07,890 --> 00:31:10,320
What if she's actually quitting?

350
00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:14,710
Think about how much profit she brings in a month.

351
00:31:14,710 --> 00:31:20,470
On top of that, think about the sales from other teachers who are scheduled around her classes.

352
00:31:20,470 --> 00:31:22,560
The academy might go out of business.

353
00:31:22,560 --> 00:31:24,160
You're crazy.

354
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:25,770
Should I try feeling Min Ji out?

355
00:31:25,770 --> 00:31:28,010
To see if she noticed anything strange?

356
00:31:28,010 --> 00:31:31,360
Why would she let Min Ji know?

357
00:31:31,360 --> 00:31:33,650
She's no one else but Seo Hye Jin.

358
00:31:35,620 --> 00:31:37,980
Be strict with the attendance.

359
00:31:37,980 --> 00:31:41,130
Minimize supplementary classes so you're less tired during the special lecture period.

360
00:31:41,130 --> 00:31:44,880
And I'll check your work log for a while.

361
00:31:46,050 --> 00:31:48,110
I've been letting you manage yourself,

362
00:31:48,110 --> 00:31:51,330
but I think I should review them to help the new teachers.

363
00:31:51,330 --> 00:31:53,790
Attendance rate, homework quality, individual progress,

364
00:31:53,790 --> 00:31:56,030
test results, and parents' counseling notes.

365
00:31:56,030 --> 00:31:59,680
Write everything down thoroughly and report back to me every day.

366
00:32:00,380 --> 00:32:03,350
I'll assume you understood.

367
00:32:03,350 --> 00:32:06,140
- Okay.
 - Shall we get up?

368
00:32:07,840 --> 00:32:10,110
Mr. Lee, let's talk for a moment.

369
00:32:20,520 --> 00:32:23,960
What are the odds that a fling grows into a relationship?

370
00:32:23,960 --> 00:32:26,590
How can you quantify that?

371
00:32:26,590 --> 00:32:28,870
Based on your personal experience.

372
00:32:28,870 --> 00:32:31,000
Personal experience?

373
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:32,860
Probably 0%.

374
00:32:33,610 --> 00:32:36,790
We don't have time to date. We don't get weekends off, either.

375
00:32:37,650 --> 00:32:39,270
Right?

376
00:32:40,460 --> 00:32:43,840
Why did you come in so late? I've been waiting for you.

377
00:32:45,980 --> 00:32:50,300
I waited to watch the director take the medicine and fall asleep.

378
00:32:50,300 --> 00:32:52,880
A drunk child.

379
00:32:54,470 --> 00:32:56,200
Jun Ho.

380
00:32:56,200 --> 00:32:58,050
Yes.

381
00:32:58,050 --> 00:33:00,500
I'll join Choeseon Korean.

382
00:33:00,500 --> 00:33:02,680
I said I don't care.

383
00:33:02,680 --> 00:33:05,230
The academy will be in chaos for a while.

384
00:33:05,230 --> 00:33:06,880
A lot of students will leave, too.

385
00:33:06,880 --> 00:33:12,000
People will talk behind my back since other teachers will be affected by it.

386
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:16,350
Jealousy, envy, gossip, and rumors are the fuel that runs this neighborhood.

387
00:33:16,350 --> 00:33:21,940
Students, parents, directors, and teachers live off that, too.

388
00:33:22,600 --> 00:33:26,030
Ignore everything you hear.

389
00:33:26,030 --> 00:33:28,120
I don't think I can do that.

390
00:33:28,820 --> 00:33:31,870
And we'll go back to how we were.

391
00:33:31,870 --> 00:33:33,100
Only on the outside?

392
00:33:33,100 --> 00:33:34,820
On the inside, too.

393
00:33:37,330 --> 00:33:39,440
Why do we have to? We already—

394
00:33:39,440 --> 00:33:41,130
Just focus on your goal.

395
00:33:41,130 --> 00:33:45,190
You can't achieve everything you want by going on about first love.

396
00:33:45,980 --> 00:33:47,780
Didn't you hear everything I said?

397
00:33:47,780 --> 00:33:49,780
I clearly meant what I said—

398
00:33:49,780 --> 00:33:52,580
I can help you only until the end of this semester.

399
00:33:52,580 --> 00:33:56,070
You need to learn as much as you can from me during that time.

400
00:33:57,720 --> 00:33:59,310
Are you playing hard to get or something?

401
00:33:59,310 --> 00:34:02,940
- Stop joking around.
 - I think you're the one joking around.

402
00:34:02,940 --> 00:34:04,960
You said you'd get famous and achieve something bigger.

403
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:06,870
Don't get distracted and focus.

404
00:34:06,870 --> 00:34:10,380
You being like this is way more distracting.

405
00:34:10,380 --> 00:34:15,740
I mean, instead of thinking, "What's wrong with her? I thought we had a connection,"

406
00:34:15,740 --> 00:34:17,910
I'd rather solve another question.

407
00:34:17,910 --> 00:34:21,610
Keep your voice down.  Keeping your personal life clean is important, too.

408
00:34:21,610 --> 00:34:23,590
What exactly...

409
00:34:24,790 --> 00:34:27,350
What exactly isn't clean about us?

410
00:34:28,360 --> 00:34:30,940
Are you so old-fashioned that our age difference bothers you? The teacher and pupil thing?

411
00:34:30,940 --> 00:34:33,930
Do you think these things can be obstacles?

412
00:34:33,930 --> 00:34:35,840
Old-fashioned?

413
00:34:38,710 --> 00:34:41,980
- I'm done talking. 
- I'm not done yet.

414
00:34:44,390 --> 00:34:46,390
There you are, Mr. Lee.

415
00:34:46,390 --> 00:34:49,540
A student is here to see you. The Huiwon High student.

416
00:34:50,550 --> 00:34:53,080
- I think you should come out.
 - Okay.

417
00:34:54,660 --> 00:34:56,430
You can go.

418
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:12,120
Mr. Lee is over there.

419
00:35:13,300 --> 00:35:17,350
Si Wu, good to see you.

420
00:35:17,350 --> 00:35:20,200
What are you doing here? The class starts next week.

421
00:35:32,370 --> 00:35:33,890
Here's what you requested.

422
00:35:33,890 --> 00:35:36,010
Oh, the notes?

423
00:35:36,010 --> 00:35:38,830
You didn't have to give it to me now.

424
00:35:38,830 --> 00:35:41,430
You should study in advance, too.

425
00:35:42,330 --> 00:35:44,770
You're really something.

426
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:47,890
Look who's here.

427
00:35:49,480 --> 00:35:52,170
- Hello, I'm Lee Si Wu.
 - I know.

428
00:35:52,170 --> 00:35:55,780
I was disappointed I missed you last time at the consultation.

429
00:35:55,780 --> 00:35:57,970
Were you?

430
00:35:57,970 --> 00:35:59,770
Yes.

431
00:35:59,770 --> 00:36:05,800
Up to now, that was my favorite Korean lecture

432
00:36:05,800 --> 00:36:07,820
I'd ever attended.

433
00:36:08,970 --> 00:36:11,200
I think I'll remember it for a long time.

434
00:36:15,380 --> 00:36:17,250
What an honor.

435
00:36:19,070 --> 00:36:23,590
You won't be able to keep teaching the same way, but

436
00:36:23,590 --> 00:36:25,280
since you were...

437
00:36:27,090 --> 00:36:29,690
humiliated by the whole universe that day.

438
00:36:29,690 --> 00:36:31,490
That's true.

439
00:36:34,430 --> 00:36:38,680
But I'd like to attend a lecture like that again.

440
00:36:44,200 --> 00:36:47,380
I need you to copy that notebook soon and give it back to me.

441
00:36:47,380 --> 00:36:49,490
I need to go to the math academy.

442
00:36:49,490 --> 00:36:51,720
- Let's head over there.
 - Okay.

443
00:36:51,720 --> 00:36:53,110
I'll see you in class.

444
00:36:53,110 --> 00:36:55,980
Okay, see you next week.

445
00:36:56,740 --> 00:36:59,170
Why didn't you tell me the same thing?

446
00:37:00,150 --> 00:37:02,650
We're both men...

447
00:37:43,450 --> 00:37:45,130
Wow.

448
00:37:47,150 --> 00:37:49,740
I totally forgot.

449
00:37:52,940 --> 00:37:55,510
 The camera is the ideal world, 

450
00:37:55,510 --> 00:37:58,720
 and boots are the reality. 

451
00:38:19,510 --> 00:38:23,210
Team Leader, aren't you going to your class?

452
00:38:54,820 --> 00:38:57,260
Meet me after class. I'll be waiting.

453
00:38:57,260 --> 00:38:59,740
Let's stop for the day. I have no energy to argue with you.

454
00:38:59,740 --> 00:39:02,710
That's good. We don't have to argue.

455
00:39:02,710 --> 00:39:04,880
Forget about all the old-fashioned concepts

456
00:39:04,880 --> 00:39:07,260
and tell me how you really feel.

457
00:39:07,260 --> 00:39:09,470
I'll accept it without arguing, then.

458
00:39:09,470 --> 00:39:12,530
How come you don't listen? Were you always like this?

459
00:39:12,530 --> 00:39:14,400
- Ms. Seo. 
- Ms. Seo?

460
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:16,380
I'm coming.

461
00:39:19,260 --> 00:39:20,990
Sorry.

462
00:39:21,770 --> 00:39:23,490
Let's go.

463
00:39:52,620 --> 00:39:57,290
I wish all lecturers in Daechi-dong were like you.

464
00:39:58,630 --> 00:40:00,120
Pardon?

465
00:40:01,630 --> 00:40:05,140
I'd be able to beat all of them, then.

466
00:40:05,140 --> 00:40:07,560
Come on.

467
00:40:07,560 --> 00:40:11,660
The classes start next week, but you don't seem concerned.

468
00:40:11,660 --> 00:40:13,920
You're wrong.

469
00:40:13,920 --> 00:40:16,180
That's a relief, then.

470
00:40:19,920 --> 00:40:24,380
If everyone were like our team leader, it'd be hopeless.

471
00:40:25,670 --> 00:40:29,470
I don't think she slept well last night, either.

472
00:40:29,470 --> 00:40:31,870
Does she take mountain ginseng or something?

473
00:40:31,870 --> 00:40:34,600
Her fridge was completely empty.

474
00:40:53,380 --> 00:40:54,960
Thank you.

475
00:40:54,960 --> 00:40:57,920
- Thank you.
 - Bye.

476
00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:04,960
What's wrong, Ms. Seo?

477
00:41:07,400 --> 00:41:08,720
I have a headache.

478
00:41:08,720 --> 00:41:11,880
I'm sorry. Should I get you some medicine?

479
00:41:11,880 --> 00:41:14,080
No, no. Let's go up.

480
00:41:14,080 --> 00:41:15,270
Thank you, as usual, Min Ji.

481
00:41:15,270 --> 00:41:17,120
Sure. Good job today.

482
00:41:17,120 --> 00:41:19,290
Thanks.

483
00:41:19,290 --> 00:41:21,040
Let me do it.

484
00:41:22,090 --> 00:41:24,640
- Don't erase this.
 - Okay.

485
00:41:27,030 --> 00:41:28,670
I'll go now.

486
00:41:36,200 --> 00:41:37,680
Ms. Seo.

487
00:41:37,680 --> 00:41:39,700
What? You haven't left?

488
00:41:39,700 --> 00:41:41,880
As you can see.

489
00:41:41,880 --> 00:41:45,680
I'm sorry, I really have no energy to argue with you tonight.

490
00:41:47,340 --> 00:41:49,670
Use me as your driver.

491
00:41:50,690 --> 00:41:54,270
I won't say anything. I'll just drive quietly.

492
00:41:55,350 --> 00:41:57,050
Give me the key.

493
00:42:37,540 --> 00:42:39,750
Does your head hurt?

494
00:42:39,750 --> 00:42:42,310
You said you wouldn't say anything.

495
00:42:50,780 --> 00:42:52,580
Where are we going?

496
00:42:53,500 --> 00:42:56,580
You're sick. I can't let you go home alone.

497
00:42:56,580 --> 00:42:59,530
I'll stay with you until you feel better.

498
00:43:31,460 --> 00:43:34,980
By the way, why does your head hurt?

499
00:43:40,070 --> 00:43:41,350
I'll get you some medicine.

500
00:43:41,350 --> 00:43:44,120
It's okay. I'm fine.

501
00:43:44,120 --> 00:43:46,600
But still. I'll be right back.

502
00:43:46,600 --> 00:43:48,640
It's because I've been hit.

503
00:43:51,600 --> 00:43:53,290
What do you mean by that?

504
00:43:53,290 --> 00:43:57,480
Well, wh-who... At the academy?

505
00:43:57,480 --> 00:44:00,620
No, by Si Wu.

506
00:44:01,460 --> 00:44:02,870
Pardon?

507
00:44:07,010 --> 00:44:09,050
Ms. Seo.

508
00:44:10,260 --> 00:44:14,200
"Up to now that was my favorite Korean lecture I've ever attended.

509
00:44:14,200 --> 00:44:16,870
I think I'll remember it for a long time."

510
00:44:17,670 --> 00:44:24,180
It hurt like my head was splitting in half when I heard that.

511
00:44:26,580 --> 00:44:30,560
That lecture didn't belong to us. It belonged to Si Wu.

512
00:44:30,560 --> 00:44:33,020
I didn't think of that.

513
00:44:34,550 --> 00:44:36,320
I lured a 16-year-old in, and...

514
00:44:36,320 --> 00:44:38,590
I was talking about the salary and the assistant director position.

515
00:44:38,590 --> 00:44:43,690
Thinking about that makes me feel so embarrassed and pathetic.

516
00:44:44,490 --> 00:44:46,670
I wanted to die.

517
00:44:50,310 --> 00:44:52,240
You're right.

518
00:44:54,100 --> 00:44:55,700
Geez.

519
00:44:57,030 --> 00:44:58,950
Let's get some fresh air.

520
00:44:58,950 --> 00:45:01,710
I want to hear more about Si Wu.

521
00:45:01,710 --> 00:45:04,200
It's cold outside.

522
00:45:04,950 --> 00:45:07,470
I need to wake up a bit.

523
00:45:10,130 --> 00:45:13,350
Choeseon Korean gave him a full scholarship?

524
00:45:13,350 --> 00:45:16,840
He was most curious about the scholarship program, too.

525
00:45:16,840 --> 00:45:20,070
He gave up on that and chose you and me.

526
00:45:20,070 --> 00:45:23,570
Director Choi called him in, and they talked about it, too.

527
00:45:25,450 --> 00:45:29,310
It sounded like he explained well why he was switching academies.

528
00:45:30,980 --> 00:45:32,920
I'm going crazy.

529
00:45:34,730 --> 00:45:38,130
We should be giving him everything he wants.

530
00:45:38,130 --> 00:45:40,210
I know.

531
00:45:40,210 --> 00:45:42,750
He can't go back to Choeseon Korean, either.

532
00:45:42,750 --> 00:45:45,100
He can't.

533
00:45:45,100 --> 00:45:47,160
I can't go, either, then.

534
00:45:47,910 --> 00:45:50,380
I don't think that's wise.

535
00:45:51,180 --> 00:45:54,680
I begged you not to leave at first, too,

536
00:45:54,680 --> 00:45:57,690
but you know that was for a personal reason.

537
00:45:59,330 --> 00:46:01,880
I can teach him well on my own.

538
00:46:01,880 --> 00:46:04,940
I'm working hard to prepare for it, so

539
00:46:04,940 --> 00:46:07,580
you should seize your opportunity.

540
00:46:07,580 --> 00:46:09,850
You said it was a once-in-a-lifetime offer.

541
00:46:09,850 --> 00:46:11,730
You...

542
00:46:12,940 --> 00:46:15,850
- are acting so cheeky. 
 - Pardon?

543
00:46:15,850 --> 00:46:18,340
Imagine how hard I'll work once I join them.

544
00:46:18,340 --> 00:46:20,200
You think you could afford to worry about Huiwon High?

545
00:46:20,200 --> 00:46:22,990
I'll be taking all the Chanyeong High students with me.

546
00:46:22,990 --> 00:46:26,740
And the academy would try their best to defend themselves.

547
00:46:26,740 --> 00:46:28,570
You didn't have to warn me like that.

548
00:46:28,570 --> 00:46:33,250
No matter how much I like money, I can't do that to Si Wu.

549
00:46:33,250 --> 00:46:37,490
I think he liked my lecture more than yours, too.

550
00:46:37,490 --> 00:46:39,580
Come on.

551
00:46:39,580 --> 00:46:42,720
I want to be responsible for him until he graduates.

552
00:46:44,010 --> 00:46:50,310
Teaching a bright kid is more amazing than you think.

553
00:47:00,350 --> 00:47:03,590
You're making me look so bad.

554
00:47:03,590 --> 00:47:05,710
♫  We'll study what came before  ♫  

555
00:47:05,710 --> 00:47:08,170
If you switch gears like this,

556
00:47:09,590 --> 00:47:11,880
I can no longer say, "I like you.

557
00:47:13,100 --> 00:47:15,410
Think of me as a man.

558
00:47:16,380 --> 00:47:18,480
Please go out with me."

559
00:47:20,090 --> 00:47:23,340
I can't say stuff like that. I'd look so bad.

560
00:47:23,340 --> 00:47:24,780
Let's get going now.

561
00:47:24,780 --> 00:47:27,000
But keep it in mind...

562
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:30,100
that I like you.

563
00:47:31,330 --> 00:47:35,220
Even when the most popular girl at school liked me,

564
00:47:35,220 --> 00:47:39,250
all I could see was Seo Hye Jin.

565
00:47:42,110 --> 00:47:44,280
So, just don't push me away.

566
00:47:44,920 --> 00:47:46,810
When I didn't have a drop of alcohol,

567
00:47:46,810 --> 00:47:49,350
and when I didn't fall into the water,

568
00:47:49,350 --> 00:47:51,670
I definitely made it clear.

569
00:47:54,040 --> 00:47:56,590
How could you

570
00:47:56,590 --> 00:48:01,060
say stuff like that without feeling embarrassed?

571
00:48:02,330 --> 00:48:04,080
Because I've been practicing since I was Si Wu's age.

I heard your fridge is completely empty.

00:49:24,780 --> 00:49:27,070
According to Ms. Nam's intel.

589
00:49:27,070 --> 00:49:28,650
Seriously.

590
00:49:30,110 --> 00:49:32,130
By the way, do you go to this store often?

591
00:49:32,130 --> 00:49:35,450
- Yes.
 - That's great.

592
00:49:36,670 --> 00:49:39,020
I'm moving to the floor above it.

593
00:49:40,570 --> 00:49:43,360
- Why?
 - I signed the contract.

594

 "The Adolescent" 

606
00:51:35,990 --> 00:51:37,860
 Since the fall leaves are at their peak, 

607
00:51:37,860 --> 00:51:40,800
 Mt. Seorak has had hikers since this morning. 

608
00:51:40,800 --> 00:51:43,380
 Reporter Im Hye Jin captured the scene for us. 

609
00:51:45,360 --> 00:51:51,390
 The fall leaves are boasting colors through the soaring mountain peaks. 

610
00:51:51,390 --> 00:51:53,470
Good morning.

611
00:51:53,470 --> 00:51:55,770
Good morning, Mom.

612
00:51:55,770 --> 00:51:57,880
What are you doing today?

613
00:51:57,880 --> 00:51:59,540
I have work.

614
00:51:59,540 --> 00:52:03,600
Let's go hiking after the meal.

615
00:52:06,760 --> 00:52:11,800
You sent your three sons to elite schools in Gangnam, but this is where you're at now.

616
00:52:11,800 --> 00:52:13,280
What?

617
00:52:13,280 --> 00:52:16,800
Don't you remember I was busiest on the weekend when I was a student?

618
00:52:18,350 --> 00:52:20,890
Lee Jun Ho, do your filial duty toward me.

619
00:52:20,890 --> 00:52:23,630
I sent all of you to college.

620
00:52:23,630 --> 00:52:26,260
I made money.

621
00:52:26,260 --> 00:52:28,730
Anyway, I'll be the busiest on weekends from now on.

622
00:52:34,260 --> 00:52:36,250
Oh, also...

623
00:52:37,020 --> 00:52:38,540
I'm moving out next month.

624
00:52:38,540 --> 00:52:40,260
Already?

625
00:52:41,020 --> 00:52:45,480
Mom, put the knife down and talk to me.

626
00:52:45,480 --> 00:52:48,150
Are you really moving out?

627
00:52:48,150 --> 00:52:49,520
Where are you moving to?

628
00:52:49,520 --> 00:52:53,090
This neighborhood is too expensive. I found a place somewhere further.

629
00:52:53,090 --> 00:52:56,910
But commuting from here would be easier.

630
00:52:56,910 --> 00:53:00,740
I'll write down the address for you. Stop by once I tidy the place up.

631
00:53:04,510 --> 00:53:07,060
 Although he's running out of breath due to the constant uphill, 

632
00:53:07,060 --> 00:53:10,680
 nothing's more precious than his time with his family. 

633
00:53:10,680 --> 00:53:13,260
 Lately, I've been... 

634
00:53:38,910 --> 00:53:41,660
Seo Hye Jin.

635
00:53:46,290 --> 00:53:48,840
What's going on with this vibe?

636
00:53:48,840 --> 00:53:50,900
What's the problem?

637
00:53:50,900 --> 00:53:53,210
No, it's nothing.

638
00:53:53,770 --> 00:53:57,220
I thought you looked different than usual.

639
00:53:58,700 --> 00:54:00,930
I got you a honey drink since you're hungover.

640
00:54:00,930 --> 00:54:02,410
Drink it.

641
00:54:02,410 --> 00:54:04,360
Thank you.

642
00:54:04,360 --> 00:54:07,170
- Aren't you glad?
 - I am.

643
00:54:10,580 --> 00:54:13,750
I want to drink and hang out with you, too.

644
00:54:13,750 --> 00:54:16,200
How could you say that right now?

645
00:54:16,200 --> 00:54:20,430
We can't make plans because you're always busy.

646
00:54:21,600 --> 00:54:23,320
Go ahead and tell me.

647
00:54:23,320 --> 00:54:25,660
You need to go back to work soon.

648
00:54:27,840 --> 00:54:29,550
Here you go.

649
00:54:32,840 --> 00:54:34,180
What's this?

650
00:54:34,180 --> 00:54:35,940
It's a token of appreciation.

651
00:54:35,940 --> 00:54:39,510
Thank you for checking the contract for me, Attorney.

652
00:54:39,510 --> 00:54:41,680
Give me money instead.

653
00:54:41,680 --> 00:54:46,230
I bought clothes to tag along when you sign the contract.

654
00:54:47,500 --> 00:54:52,490
I don't appreciate how you're always so formal.

655
00:54:52,490 --> 00:54:55,070
It's because I feel bad.

656
00:54:56,500 --> 00:54:59,690
I decided not to join Choeseon Korean.

657
00:54:59,690 --> 00:55:01,200
Huh?

658
00:55:03,720 --> 00:55:05,650
What's the reason?

659
00:55:05,650 --> 00:55:08,550
There's a student I want to teach.

660
00:55:11,710 --> 00:55:14,530
I've never heard that before.

661
00:55:14,530 --> 00:55:19,200
You're turning down an excellent offer like that because of a student?

662
00:55:19,200 --> 00:55:21,370
As an academy lecturer?

663
00:55:21,370 --> 00:55:23,900
I just made a human decision.

664
00:55:23,900 --> 00:55:27,970
Isn't it human to follow money?

665
00:55:28,580 --> 00:55:31,380
A teacher-like decision, then?

666
00:55:31,380 --> 00:55:33,270
That's too grandiose.

667
00:55:33,270 --> 00:55:36,630
Let's just call it a sentimental decision.

668
00:55:36,630 --> 00:55:38,790
Is that all there is?

669
00:55:41,830 --> 00:55:46,930
You said you couldn't bring yourself to leave before.

670
00:55:46,930 --> 00:55:48,980
That has nothing to do with this?

671
00:55:50,930 --> 00:55:52,720
Yeah, nothing.

672
00:55:52,720 --> 00:55:55,070
Okay.

673
00:55:55,070 --> 00:55:59,000
You know I'm on standby 24-7, right?

674
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:02,480
Call me anytime if you need to talk.

675
00:56:03,260 --> 00:56:04,760
Okay.

676
00:56:06,530 --> 00:56:11,810
 Daechi Choeseon Korean 

677
00:56:11,810 --> 00:56:16,460
I didn't think you'd come by during the peak hour.

678
00:56:16,460 --> 00:56:19,980
I figured it didn't matter if I had a clear conscience.

679
00:56:22,680 --> 00:56:25,500
Both you and I need to start the day.

680
00:56:25,500 --> 00:56:28,540
So, I'll just keep it brief and leave.

681
00:56:29,890 --> 00:56:33,460
First of all, thank you for the generous offer.

682
00:56:34,460 --> 00:56:38,620
I don't want to brag, but I worked hard on it.

683
00:56:38,620 --> 00:56:40,610
I could tell.

684
00:56:40,610 --> 00:56:43,270
It was the best offer I've gotten,

685
00:56:43,270 --> 00:56:47,430
and the content was clear, too. I admire you for that.

686
00:56:47,430 --> 00:56:53,510
It made me realize I have a lot to learn from you.

687
00:56:57,030 --> 00:57:05,160
I wanted to tell you that my decision has nothing to do with the contract terms.

688
00:57:12,840 --> 00:57:15,950
I'll stay at my current workplace.

689

 Daechi Choeseon Korean 

691
00:58:12,200 --> 00:58:14,000
I'm sorry.

692
00:58:15,000 --> 00:58:16,230
Ms. Seo.

693
00:58:16,230 --> 00:58:18,110
It's funny to see you here.

694
00:58:18,110 --> 00:58:20,150
What brings you here?

695
00:58:22,010 --> 00:58:23,780
How about you?

696
00:58:24,460 --> 00:58:28,470
I was visiting a teacher I know. How about you?

697
00:58:29,510 --> 00:58:32,020
I came by to return the textbooks.

698
00:58:32,020 --> 00:58:35,470
I got a text that the scholarship included the textbook fees.

699
00:58:38,900 --> 00:58:41,030
Do you want me to wait for you?

700
00:58:44,640 --> 00:58:45,860
But why?

701
00:58:45,860 --> 00:58:48,850
I was thinking of buying you something to drink.

702
00:58:50,330 --> 00:58:52,510
I need to go straight to English academy.

703
00:58:52,510 --> 00:58:55,340
Oh, right. Yes.

704
00:58:55,340 --> 00:58:57,450
See you next week, then.

705
00:58:58,180 --> 00:58:59,650
Go ahead.

706
00:59:06,760 --> 00:59:08,560
Thank you.

707
00:59:18,770 --> 00:59:22,460
What made you call this morning, Mr. Lee?

708
00:59:22,460 --> 00:59:24,310
Huh? What's going on?

709
00:59:24,310 --> 00:59:27,030
Are you happy that I called you?

710
00:59:27,830 --> 00:59:29,500
Where are you?

711
00:59:31,730 --> 00:59:34,860
♫  Days go by  ♫

712
00:59:35,960 --> 00:59:38,760
♫  Life is short  ♫

713
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:47,300
♫  Something I know now even more  ♫

714
00:59:48,410 --> 00:59:51,420
♫  But I'm still here  ♫

715
00:59:52,170 --> 00:59:54,670
You should've stayed there.

716
00:59:56,420 --> 01:00:04,080
♫  Waiting for the time when I can hold you again  ♫

717
01:00:05,570 --> 01:00:07,180
Why are you in a good mood?

718
01:00:07,180 --> 01:00:09,220
Why did you want to see me?

719
01:00:09,220 --> 01:00:11,820
Ms. Oh Jeong Hwa made me kimbap.

720
01:00:11,820 --> 01:00:14,660
So, I thought I'd share it with you before work.

721
01:00:14,660 --> 01:00:18,420
I want to head over to the academy.

722
01:00:18,420 --> 01:00:19,930
Why?

723
01:00:19,930 --> 01:00:22,320
Because I want to study.

724
01:00:22,320 --> 01:00:24,350
Pardon?

725
01:00:24,350 --> 01:00:26,880
I met Si Wu.

726
01:00:28,030 --> 01:00:29,900
I just ran into him.

727
01:00:30,550 --> 01:00:34,660
I would've felt so embarrassed and guilty if I switched academies.

728
01:00:34,660 --> 01:00:37,310
Just thinking about it gives me the chills.

729
01:00:37,310 --> 01:00:42,330
I thought I made a great decision.

730
01:00:43,010 --> 01:00:45,870
You were so proud of yourself, weren't you?

731
01:00:45,870 --> 01:00:48,440
I'm basically stoked right now.

732
01:00:48,440 --> 01:00:50,470
Stoked?

733
01:00:50,470 --> 01:00:53,380
Since when did you talk like that?

734
01:00:54,760 --> 01:00:56,750
You were right.

735
01:00:59,310 --> 01:01:01,910
I haven't liked myself...

736
01:01:03,040 --> 01:01:05,370
this much in a long time.

737
01:01:07,580 --> 01:01:11,730

738

739
01:01:15,820 --> 01:01:20,640
♫  I'll always want to be  ♫

01:01:20,640 --> 01:01:24,670
♫  Together with you  ♫

741

01:01:29,020 --> 01:01:33,250
♫  Together with you  ♫

 The Midnight Romance in Hagwon 

745
01:01:41,460 --> 01:01:43,900
 For some reason, I didn't want to go back to the empty house. 

746
01:01:43,900 --> 01:01:45,360
 Do you feel lonely, too? 

747
01:01:45,360 --> 01:01:47,630
 Shouldn't you just keep her company? 

748
01:01:47,630 --> 01:01:50,020
 You saw through my lies, didn't you? 

749
01:01:50,020 --> 01:01:53,500
 They're dating? Those are age-old feelings. 

750
01:01:53,500 --> 01:01:54,760
 It's your sister-in-law, you bastard. 

751
01:01:54,760 --> 01:01:58,450
 This is a secret. I can't create the schedule if people find out about us. 

752
01:01:58,450 --> 01:02:00,430
 This can't be your first time being betrayed. 

753
01:02:00,430 --> 01:02:03,790
 Are you telling me to eat the crumbs right now? 

754
01:02:03,790 --> 01:02:07,580
 How could you not like Jun Ho? 

755
01:02:08,280 --> 01:02:11,900
 I've completely run out of patience.
