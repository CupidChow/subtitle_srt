No, Seung Gyu helped me unpack today.

But he hasn't gone home yet.

44

Why?

111
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:39,040
He said he was having a work dinner tonight.

Let's tell him to have the second round here.

He has to go to work tomorrow morning. Why would you?

Why don't you... invite Seo Hye Jin?

118
00:10:45,350 --> 00:10:47,470
You said she lives nearby.

119
00:10:47,470 --> 00:10:52,360
Why do you always want to call people over whenever you drink?

120
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:55,730
While I was mopping all day,

121
00:10:55,730 --> 00:10:58,930
I solved a major mystery.

122
00:10:58,930 --> 00:11:03,080
You could say... it was a great discovery as a historian.

123
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:04,190
Oh, really?

124
00:11:04,190 --> 00:11:05,930
- I was going to tell you about it. 
- I see.

125
00:11:05,930 --> 00:11:09,490
Wow. That sounds really boring.

126
00:11:10,580 --> 00:11:12,380
It's about you.

127
00:11:12,380 --> 00:11:13,880
Me?

128
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:20,940
I've met a few girlfriends you've had, you know.

129
00:11:21,810 --> 00:11:26,310
So? You want to invite my girlfriend to tell her about my dating history?

130
00:11:26,310 --> 00:11:29,660
- Are you nuts?
 - Just listen.

131
00:11:31,180 --> 00:11:34,400
For some reason, I couldn't figure out your type.

132
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:38,480
Your exes didn't have much in common, I guess.

133
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:40,830
It used to be that way.

134
00:11:40,830 --> 00:11:46,740
The only thing I can think of is that they didn't last that long.

135
00:11:46,740 --> 00:11:48,290
So?

136
00:11:49,550 --> 00:11:53,920
But there was one crucial thing that was very consistent.

137
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:56,260
What is it?

138
00:11:56,920 --> 00:11:59,350
- Are you curious? 
- Geez.

139
00:11:59,350 --> 00:12:01,860
Yes. Tell me.

140
00:12:09,190 --> 00:12:11,450
Dimples.

141
00:12:11,450 --> 00:12:16,590
All of your exes had dimples.

142
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:22,330
Right? It's Seo Hye Jin's trademark.

143
00:12:24,310 --> 00:12:27,060
You're so consistent.

144

Don't wait for me and go to bed.

145
00:12:31,590 --> 00:12:34,220
What? Hey, where are you going?

146
00:12:34,220 --> 00:12:38,210
It's none of your business. Call Ho Jae if you want to.

147
00:12:39,220 --> 00:12:43,130
Instead, if you call her by her name once more...

148
00:12:43,130 --> 00:12:45,130
I'll kill you for sure.

149

♫  You probably got me all wrong  ♫

165
00:14:14,420 --> 00:14:16,700
♫  If I could just tag along  ♫

Gosh.

174
00:14:52,900 --> 00:14:56,460
You're sweating. Aren't you cold?

175
00:14:56,460 --> 00:14:59,820
I think I ran 100 meters in eight seconds.

176
00:14:59,820 --> 00:15:02,370
I deserve a gold medal.

177
00:15:05,520 --> 00:15:07,770
Seriously.

178
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:13,530

00:16:13,580 --> 00:16:15,250
Hold on.

183
00:16:16,460 --> 00:16:19,800
The light. Let's turn the light off.

184
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:21,310
Okay.

185
00:16:29,010 --> 00:16:33,350
Teach, I want to see your face.

186
00:16:34,750 --> 00:16:36,550
Hold on.

187
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:40,550
No, I won't turn the light on.

188
00:16:43,290 --> 00:16:45,500
Stop moving.

189
00:16:50,260 --> 00:16:51,540
Teach, I...

190
00:16:51,540 --> 00:16:54,070
Move, I said!

191
00:16:56,430 --> 00:16:58,650
My gosh.

192
00:16:58,650 --> 00:17:00,560
My gosh, are you hurt?

193
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:02,380
Are you okay?

194
00:17:02,380 --> 00:17:03,910
What did you land on?

195
00:17:03,910 --> 00:17:06,940
You didn't land on your head, right?

196
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:11,200
Please explain what's going on first.

197
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:12,560
My gosh.

198
00:17:12,560 --> 00:17:15,620
- If you changed your mind—
 - No, it's not that.

199
00:17:19,560 --> 00:17:21,780
- Are you really that stupid?
 - Pardon?

200
00:17:21,780 --> 00:17:26,620
Gosh, I... I don't know how much I need to teach you.

201
00:17:26,620 --> 00:17:29,560
- Teach, what did I— 
 - That!

202
00:17:29,560 --> 00:17:31,090
Don't say that.

203
00:17:31,090 --> 00:17:35,220
- Teach! 
- Don't call me, "Teach," I said.

204
00:17:35,220 --> 00:17:41,060
Hearing that makes me feel like I'm doing something really bad.

205
00:17:47,540 --> 00:17:51,770
Let me see. What did you land on?

206
00:17:54,060 --> 00:17:57,460
Gosh. You should be glad. If I fell head-on like this,

207
00:17:57,460 --> 00:17:59,960
you would've had to live alone forever.

208
00:18:01,670 --> 00:18:03,770
It's your fault.

209
00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:07,600
Okay.

210
00:18:08,490 --> 00:18:10,830
Teach me properly now.

211
00:18:20,970 --> 00:18:22,140
What now?

212
00:18:22,140 --> 00:18:24,320
I have a confession to make.

213
00:18:40,790 --> 00:18:42,530
I can't see anymore.

214
00:18:42,530 --> 00:18:44,490
Go ahead and confess.

215
00:18:46,380 --> 00:18:48,040
I...

216
00:18:51,350 --> 00:18:53,110
I...

217
00:18:56,370 --> 00:18:59,110
can't teach you this.

218
00:19:01,770 --> 00:19:03,290
What did you say?

219
00:19:04,350 --> 00:19:07,190
You knew, right?

220
00:19:07,190 --> 00:19:10,980
Not at all. I thought you were a pro.

221
00:19:16,340 --> 00:19:21,290
Is there something else I need to know?

222
00:19:21,290 --> 00:19:23,440
I don't think so.

223
00:19:24,420 --> 00:19:27,150
I'll tell you something this time, then.

224
00:19:30,380 --> 00:19:32,680
I...

225
00:19:33,610 --> 00:19:35,440
love Seo Hye Jin.

226
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:45,450
I've been loving you for much longer...

227
00:19:46,490 --> 00:19:48,470
than I thought.

228
00:19:49,750 --> 00:19:52,950
♫  Not everything is passin  ♫

229
00:19:52,950 --> 00:19:55,950
Should I say it again?

230
00:19:55,950 --> 00:19:57,960
I love—

231
00:20:03,350 --> 00:20:05,230
You don't have to tell me.

232
00:20:07,690 --> 00:20:09,500
I can...

233
00:20:10,910 --> 00:20:12,850
feel it already.

234

You need to go, don't you?

248
00:21:44,510 --> 00:21:46,490
Yes.

249
00:21:46,490 --> 00:21:50,550
I should've cut ties with Seung Gyu.

- Okay.

254
00:22:10,150 --> 00:22:14,050
I think I need to feed Seung Gyu breakfast.

255
00:22:15,650 --> 00:22:19,470
Get some more sleep at home. You're free in the morning.

256
00:22:23,430 --> 00:22:24,780
I have time.

Excuse me, are you Mr. Pyo Sang Seob?

264
00:23:28,150 --> 00:23:30,890
Yes, I am.

265
00:23:40,940 --> 00:23:43,980
Why did you come to see me?

266
00:23:43,980 --> 00:23:47,010
It seemed like you didn't answer calls from unknown numbers.

267
00:23:47,010 --> 00:23:50,090
I'm asking why the academy needs to see me.

268
00:23:51,240 --> 00:23:53,240
May I give you a ride?

269
00:23:53,240 --> 00:23:55,730
I'll tell you on the way.

270
00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:03,070
Well, it won't make you feel uncomfortable.

271
00:24:06,160 --> 00:24:08,380
See you at the academy.

272
00:24:08,380 --> 00:24:11,050
Don't be too late.

273
00:24:11,050 --> 00:24:12,900
Because you'd miss me?

274
00:24:12,900 --> 00:24:16,280
Kids are getting the exam results today. Aren't you nervous?

275
00:24:17,220 --> 00:24:19,610
Not really. I taught them perfectly.

276
00:24:19,610 --> 00:24:22,190
By resisting my urge to hug you.

277
00:24:25,050 --> 00:24:26,950
Hello.

278
00:24:29,320 --> 00:24:31,760
 The door is closing. 

279
00:25:34,950 --> 00:25:38,760
 Good morning, guys. It's finally the Korean exam day. 

280
00:25:38,760 --> 00:25:42,930
 Don't be nervous. Just think you're being rewarded for all of your efforts. 

281
00:25:42,930 --> 00:25:44,590
 Let's hang in there a bit longer. 

282
00:25:44,590 --> 00:25:46,530
 Don't make mistakes on the questions you know the answers to. 

283
00:25:46,530 --> 00:25:49,590
 And face the difficult questions using the energy of the universe. 

284
00:25:49,590 --> 00:25:52,250
 Cheer up! Our class can get the perfect score. 

285
00:25:52,250 --> 00:25:53,540
 You can do it! 

286
00:25:53,540 --> 00:25:55,410
What's with the stickers?

287
00:25:55,410 --> 00:25:57,600
Is this really Ms. Seo?

288
00:25:58,270 --> 00:26:00,490
Maybe her account got hacked.

289
00:26:00,490 --> 00:26:03,090
She's acting like a totally different person.

290
00:26:05,210 --> 00:26:07,060
It can't be.

291
00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:11,250
Doesn't Ms. Seo look happy these days?

292
00:26:11,250 --> 00:26:15,800
She must be. She'll be free once the exam ends, too.

293
00:26:15,800 --> 00:26:18,320
I wonder what the questions will be like.

294
00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:19,570
I'm so scared.

295
00:26:19,570 --> 00:26:21,150
I'm totally confident.

296
00:26:21,150 --> 00:26:24,750
Ms. Seo even analyzed Sang Seob's breathing pattern, too.

297
00:26:25,560 --> 00:26:28,480
A lot of people can see us in Daechi-dong

298
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:31,460
and it's the exam season, too.

299
00:26:31,460 --> 00:26:36,750
First, our director asked me to apologize to you

300
00:26:36,750 --> 00:26:38,930
for visiting you like this.

301
00:26:43,860 --> 00:26:48,210
You'll see an envelope next to you.

302
00:26:48,210 --> 00:26:51,800
It's Choeseon Korean's contract.

303
00:26:51,800 --> 00:26:55,230
There's the director's business card inside, too.

304
00:26:55,230 --> 00:26:57,410
Have a look at it and contact us.

305
00:26:59,890 --> 00:27:04,390
Drop me off at any subway station you see.

306
00:27:44,630 --> 00:27:46,840
Yes, Director.

307
00:27:46,840 --> 00:27:49,110
Yes, I met him.

308
00:27:50,050 --> 00:27:52,820
He got out in the middle without the contract

309
00:27:52,820 --> 00:27:55,110
As you expected.

310
00:27:57,280 --> 00:28:00,130
Yes, I'll go to your place now.

311
00:28:00,130 --> 00:28:02,780
 Way Out Exit 

312
00:28:54,490 --> 00:28:57,240
- You must be ready, right? 
- You scared me!

313
00:28:57,240 --> 00:28:59,880
Give me your passcode, and we'll call it even.

314
00:28:59,880 --> 00:29:01,600
What do you mean call it even, punk?

315
00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:03,840
Don't worry.

316
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:06,140
You think I'd come here every day?

317
00:29:06,140 --> 00:29:08,140
I'll come only when I get off school early.

318
00:29:08,140 --> 00:29:09,770
Get lost.

319
00:29:10,970 --> 00:29:12,930
Okay.

320
00:29:27,290 --> 00:29:29,130
Hey, Mom.

321
00:29:29,130 --> 00:29:31,330
Are you at work?

322
00:29:32,290 --> 00:29:35,300
Jun Ho's move went well.

323
00:29:35,920 --> 00:29:37,950
But last night, this bastard—

324
00:29:37,950 --> 00:29:40,910
0327. 0327.

325
00:29:40,910 --> 00:29:44,740
He must've been tired last night. He passed out as soon as he got home.

326
00:29:44,740 --> 00:29:46,650
I'm sure he was.

327
00:29:46,650 --> 00:29:48,550
The finals lecture ended yesterday.

328
00:29:48,550 --> 00:29:50,930
Yes, yes.

329
00:29:51,730 --> 00:29:52,830
Okay.

330
00:29:52,830 --> 00:29:56,050
Seung Gyu, make him get you an expensive meal.

331
00:29:56,050 --> 00:29:58,770
Since he exploited my precious son,

332
00:29:58,770 --> 00:30:01,200
he should treat you properly, at least.

333
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:04,470
Okay. Bye.

334
00:30:04,470 --> 00:30:06,660
Why did you come in so early?

335
00:30:06,660 --> 00:30:10,870
I couldn't sleep well because I was nervous about the exam today.

336
00:30:11,530 --> 00:30:15,030
I didn't know the unrivaled Ms. Nam gets nervous, too.

337
00:30:15,030 --> 00:30:17,320
Only during the exam season.

338
00:30:17,320 --> 00:30:18,690
Don't worry.

339
00:30:18,690 --> 00:30:22,550
Both the moms and students speak very highly of you.

340
00:30:23,700 --> 00:30:27,420
You get assessed by the grades, not words.

341
00:30:27,420 --> 00:30:30,040
- Yes.
 - Right.

342
00:30:43,120 --> 00:30:46,200
Min Ji, you're on your way to work, right?

343
00:30:46,200 --> 00:30:51,230
Re-send an announcement asking the students to send the presumed scores.

344
00:30:51,230 --> 00:30:53,640
And you know the ones who don't respond if they fail?

345
00:30:53,640 --> 00:30:55,790
Contact them separately.

346
00:30:55,790 --> 00:30:59,960
Yes. I'll stop by the bookstore and go to work. Bye.

347
00:31:05,970 --> 00:31:11,040
 Exam Instructions 

348
00:31:15,580 --> 00:31:18,370
Any questions regarding the exam questions?

349
00:31:22,830 --> 00:31:27,210
Teacher, can I have another OMR card?

350
00:31:27,210 --> 00:31:28,700
Okay.

351
00:32:36,710 --> 00:32:39,810
 Have you heard from the ones who finished the exam... 

352
00:32:39,810 --> 00:32:42,490
 Min Ji 

353
00:32:43,090 --> 00:32:45,350
Hey, Min Ji. They're done, right?

354
00:32:45,350 --> 00:32:47,390
Yes, Ms. Seo.

355
00:32:47,390 --> 00:32:49,260
Chanyeong High and Huiwon High are finished.

356
00:32:49,260 --> 00:32:52,530
They started sending the presumed scores.

357
00:32:52,530 --> 00:32:55,350
Huiwon High's Si Wu, Hye Seung, Han Gyeol, and Yun Chan

358
00:32:55,350 --> 00:32:57,940
 got a perfect score on multiple-choice questions. 

359
00:32:57,940 --> 00:33:00,710
 I think it'll take some time to sort out Chanyeong High results. 

360
00:33:00,710 --> 00:33:04,000
 There are a lot of students who got a perfect score on multiple-choice. 

361
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:06,110
I'll check Chanyeong High myself.

362
00:33:06,110 --> 00:33:09,730
Having too many perfect scores on multiple-choice questions might be bad, too.

363
00:33:09,730 --> 00:33:11,720
No, I'm happy.

364
00:33:11,720 --> 00:33:14,520
But that'll make the short-answer question evaluation hard.

365
00:33:14,520 --> 00:33:16,450
Let's talk when I get back.

366
00:33:16,450 --> 00:33:18,070
Print the exam sheets they sent.

367
00:33:18,070 --> 00:33:20,990
Okay, Ms. Seo. See you later.

368
00:33:23,010 --> 00:33:24,790
Wow!

369
00:33:26,660 --> 00:33:29,900
Ms. Min Ji,  I guessed three related texts correctly.

370
00:33:29,900 --> 00:33:32,190
- Really? 
 - Especially in classical poetry!

371
00:33:32,190 --> 00:33:34,210
My gosh! Congratulations!

372
00:33:34,210 --> 00:33:35,450
Daebak.

373
00:33:35,450 --> 00:33:37,140
Hello.

374
00:33:37,140 --> 00:33:38,320
Hello.

375
00:33:38,320 --> 00:33:40,260
I'm finally starting to relax a bit.

376
00:33:40,260 --> 00:33:41,800
It's so great.

377
00:33:41,800 --> 00:33:43,360
Thank you.

378
00:33:43,360 --> 00:33:45,500
What's so great?

379
00:33:45,500 --> 00:33:47,240
My gosh.

380
00:33:47,240 --> 00:33:51,130
 Chanyeong High 10th Grade Korean Exam - Second Semester of 2023 

381
00:33:51,130 --> 00:33:53,920
Here's Chanyeong High's exam sheet.

382
00:33:59,340 --> 00:34:03,350
Should I meet Mr. Pyo again?

383
00:34:03,350 --> 00:34:05,740
He didn't even try to check the contract,

384
00:34:05,740 --> 00:34:08,910
so it was difficult to talk to him.

385
00:34:08,910 --> 00:34:11,260
Leave him.

386
00:34:11,260 --> 00:34:12,640
Pardon?

387
00:34:59,940 --> 00:35:01,980
 This is the first floor. 

388
00:35:06,230 --> 00:35:08,290
 Going up. 

389
00:35:10,100 --> 00:35:12,310
 The door is closing. 

390
00:35:13,820 --> 00:35:15,760
You came in early, Team Leader.

391
00:35:15,760 --> 00:35:18,430
You came in early, too, Mr. Lee.

392
00:35:18,430 --> 00:35:21,690
It seems like the exam results are looking good.

393
00:35:21,690 --> 00:35:23,760
I heard, too.

394
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:27,070
Could I have a one-on-one with you if you aren't too busy?

395
00:35:27,070 --> 00:35:29,620
I'm usually very busy.

396
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:34,070
I just need five minutes, Team Leader.

397
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:51,940
Did you send Seung Gyu home okay?

398
00:35:51,940 --> 00:35:54,680
Si Wu told me he did well in the exam.

399
00:35:54,680 --> 00:35:57,050
I heard from Min Ji.

400
00:35:57,940 --> 00:36:00,480
This is so awesome.

401
00:36:02,600 --> 00:36:05,520
Did you feel this way with me, too?

402
00:36:05,520 --> 00:36:08,190
What? You said you don't get nervous.

403
00:36:09,030 --> 00:36:13,730
I try not to look nervous because it'll make me look silly.

404
00:36:15,600 --> 00:36:17,880
This is no good. I'll go now.

405
00:36:17,880 --> 00:36:19,510
Come out a little later.

406
00:36:19,510 --> 00:36:21,250
Hold on. Hold on.

407
00:36:23,050 --> 00:36:25,350
No, I'm blushing.

408
00:36:26,970 --> 00:36:29,590
- Stay put.
 - Okay.

409
00:36:47,500 --> 00:36:49,540
- Hello, Ms. Kim.
 - Hello.

410
00:36:49,540 --> 00:36:50,940
Did you just get here?

411
00:36:50,940 --> 00:36:52,510
Yes.

412
00:36:52,510 --> 00:36:54,620
Why are you coming up from there?

413
00:36:54,620 --> 00:36:56,830
I left something after the class yesterday.

414
00:36:56,830 --> 00:36:57,830
How about you?

415
00:36:57,830 --> 00:37:01,270
I left my pouch in the classroom, too.

416
00:37:01,270 --> 00:37:04,520
I lost my mind because of the emergency supplementary lecture.

417
00:37:08,330 --> 00:37:09,560
By the way,

418
00:37:09,560 --> 00:37:14,780
didn't you give a lecture here yesterday, not downstairs?

419
00:37:14,780 --> 00:37:17,930
I know. I got confused. I'm going there now.

420
00:37:18,790 --> 00:37:21,090
I've never seen you like this before.

421
00:37:21,090 --> 00:37:24,080
I must've lost my mind, too.

422
00:37:24,080 --> 00:37:26,400
- Well, then... 
- Yes.

423
00:37:31,860 --> 00:37:35,260
 Come out later. Take the elevator to come up. 

424
00:37:56,710 --> 00:37:58,790
Mr. Lee?

425
00:37:58,790 --> 00:38:01,390
Hello, Ms. Kim.

426
00:38:01,390 --> 00:38:04,770
What are you doing here? You didn't stop by the office, either.

427
00:38:04,770 --> 00:38:09,670
I wanted to practice blackboard writing since I came in early.

428
00:38:09,670 --> 00:38:11,790
What brings you here?

429
00:38:11,790 --> 00:38:13,250
I left something here.

430
00:38:13,250 --> 00:38:15,190
Oh, I see.

431
00:38:15,190 --> 00:38:17,070
You're so diligent.

432
00:38:17,070 --> 00:38:19,070
The special lecture just ended.

433
00:38:19,070 --> 00:38:21,870
There are so many things to do.

434
00:38:21,870 --> 00:38:24,140
You'll become successful.

435
00:38:24,140 --> 00:38:26,180
Thank you. I'll leave, then.

436
00:38:26,180 --> 00:38:29,070
By the way, did you know?

437
00:38:29,070 --> 00:38:30,750
Know what?

438
00:38:30,750 --> 00:38:33,540
I'm the best when it comes to blackboard writing.

439
00:38:34,300 --> 00:38:38,560
Sometimes, I'm told I'm better than Team Leader Seo.

440
00:38:38,560 --> 00:38:42,730
Oh, I see. I've heard about it.

441
00:38:42,730 --> 00:38:45,350
Don't you want me to give you a lesson?

442
00:38:46,230 --> 00:38:51,080
Do I have to withdraw from my savings account to afford it or something?

443
00:38:52,760 --> 00:38:59,350
I can give you a special discount and let you buy me dinner.

444
00:39:01,410 --> 00:39:03,470
Well, last time, I—

445
00:39:03,470 --> 00:39:05,710
Should I give you a lesson now?

446
00:39:05,710 --> 00:39:10,800
No, I think I should practice first.

447
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:14,860
If so, practice and message me.

448
00:39:14,860 --> 00:39:16,730
I'll have a look at it.

449
00:39:16,730 --> 00:39:19,790
- It's okay.
 - You don't have to say no.

450
00:39:19,790 --> 00:39:22,200
I don't eat that much.

451
00:39:36,990 --> 00:39:40,470
She did great here. But it's such a shame she missed this.

452
00:39:40,470 --> 00:39:43,690
-  Don't you think? 
 - I know. She must've lost focus.

453
00:39:43,690 --> 00:39:46,680
I taught her this. Excuse me.

454
00:39:47,660 --> 00:39:50,040
I'll have a look at the rest later.

455
00:39:50,040 --> 00:39:52,370
- I'll let you get back to it.
 - Okay.

456
00:39:59,950 --> 00:40:02,030
 I'm trapped in here. 

457
00:40:02,030 --> 00:40:05,390
 Ms. Kim is giving me a blackboard writing lesson. 

458
00:40:30,280 --> 00:40:31,990
Team Leader Seo.

459
00:40:33,060 --> 00:40:34,760
Team Leader Seo?

460
00:40:37,070 --> 00:40:39,350
What's wrong? Are you not feeling well?

461
00:41:02,180 --> 00:41:04,020
 Do you want me to rescue you? 

462
00:41:15,060 --> 00:41:17,010
 Please. 

463
00:41:17,010 --> 00:41:19,970
Somebody call Mr. Lee. Ask him why he isn't here yet.

464
00:41:19,970 --> 00:41:21,450
I want to have a meeting.

465
00:41:21,450 --> 00:41:24,540
- I'll call him.
 - Mr. Lee is here.

466
00:41:24,540 --> 00:41:27,140
He's downstairs to practice blackboard writing.

467
00:41:27,140 --> 00:41:29,170
I'll call him.

468
00:41:30,540 --> 00:41:33,900
Si Wu, what are you doing here?

469
00:41:39,130 --> 00:41:43,420
Tell Mr. Lee to run over here.

470
00:41:43,420 --> 00:41:48,110
You mean you got these correctly but without understanding them?

471
00:41:48,110 --> 00:41:49,580
Yes.

472
00:41:49,580 --> 00:41:54,070
I would've gotten them wrong if you hadn't given us the expected question list.

473
00:41:57,360 --> 00:41:59,570
Let us compliment you first.

474
00:42:00,710 --> 00:42:04,570
I would've panicked at question No. 5 if I were in that situation,

475
00:42:04,570 --> 00:42:07,280
but you gave correct answers for the rest of them.

476
00:42:07,280 --> 00:42:09,160
That's really impressive.

477
00:42:11,540 --> 00:42:13,700
- I suppose—
 - And secondly,

478
00:42:13,700 --> 00:42:16,670
you're worried about what you don't know even after getting them correct.

479
00:42:16,670 --> 00:42:18,900
That's even more impressive.

480
00:42:18,900 --> 00:42:23,210
If it were an unfamiliar text, I would've gotten it wrong 100%.

481
00:42:23,210 --> 00:42:27,330
I'm still not sure what the text says.

482
00:42:27,330 --> 00:42:31,330
I just memorized that the singer's soul means Upo Marsh's heron

483
00:42:31,330 --> 00:42:33,730
and just went with it.

484
00:42:33,730 --> 00:42:38,010
Mr. Lee is saying it's a good thing you're contemplating these things.

485
00:42:38,010 --> 00:42:39,520
Usually, students in 12th grade

486
00:42:39,520 --> 00:42:43,290
who are at the top of their class stress out about these things.

487
00:42:43,290 --> 00:42:48,340
Because literature doesn't seem to be about choosing the answer out of five options.

488
00:42:52,620 --> 00:42:54,560
What's wrong?

489
00:42:54,560 --> 00:42:58,850
That's exactly how I feel.

490
00:43:01,250 --> 00:43:06,320
I want to take the exam knowing I prepared perfectly.

491
00:43:07,120 --> 00:43:09,800
I can do that with other subjects.

492
00:43:09,800 --> 00:43:11,830
But with Korean...

493
00:43:12,910 --> 00:43:17,920
The literature section especially always makes me uneasy.

494
00:43:17,920 --> 00:43:22,920
That makes me keep solving questions blindly.

495
00:43:22,920 --> 00:43:27,040
It feels like I spend more time on it, but I don't think I'm improving.

496
00:43:27,040 --> 00:43:31,360
So, the reason you came here as soon as the exam ended is...

497
00:43:31,360 --> 00:43:32,940
I just...

498
00:43:34,810 --> 00:43:36,920
Wanted to talk, right?

499
00:43:39,410 --> 00:43:42,600
It'd be tough to survive if you said stuff like that at school.

500
00:43:42,600 --> 00:43:48,220
The male students would especially say, "Look how he's bragging."

501
00:43:52,330 --> 00:43:55,110
- That's true. 
- I'm glad you told us.

502
00:43:55,110 --> 00:43:57,540
This is a good challenge for me.

503
00:43:58,550 --> 00:44:00,900
Would you be able to solve this problem?

504
00:44:03,260 --> 00:44:05,380
There's something you don't know.

505
00:44:05,380 --> 00:44:09,000
I can do most things once I set my mind to them.

506
00:44:11,910 --> 00:44:17,720
I have to secure a Level 1 spot in Korean for you.

507
00:44:17,720 --> 00:44:20,010
But I just changed my goal.

508
00:44:23,670 --> 00:44:25,610
Like getting into medical school?

509
00:44:25,610 --> 00:44:27,610
It's not easy stuff like that.

510
00:44:29,540 --> 00:44:31,950
I'll make you get the perfect score in the entrance exam.

511
00:44:31,950 --> 00:44:33,970
No. 1 in the country.

512
00:44:34,630 --> 00:44:36,640
Okay?

513
00:44:36,640 --> 00:44:40,350
You'd better mention my name when they interview you later, okay?

514
00:44:40,350 --> 00:44:41,920
Okay.

515
00:44:45,040 --> 00:44:48,870
Si Wu takes his studies very seriously.

516
00:44:53,300 --> 00:44:56,450
I'm suddenly feeling scared.

517
00:44:56,450 --> 00:45:00,020
I know. Why did you say stuff like that?

518
00:45:00,020 --> 00:45:02,160
I'm not worried about that.

519
00:45:03,450 --> 00:45:06,820
I think I might lose my title as your favorite student.

520
00:45:08,750 --> 00:45:10,610
Does it not matter?

521
00:45:10,610 --> 00:45:12,970
Because I'm not your student,

522
00:45:14,030 --> 00:45:15,640
but your boyfriend.

523
00:45:15,640 --> 00:45:17,740
Are you crazy?

524
00:45:21,120 --> 00:45:23,910
The academy is so fun.

525
00:45:44,860 --> 00:45:49,480
Teacher, this is considered an error, right?

526
00:45:51,320 --> 00:45:55,490
Yes. Because it's missing the word "positive."

527
00:45:56,810 --> 00:45:58,990
But it does make sense, though.

528
00:45:58,990 --> 00:46:03,400
The ones who didn't put a period are about to lose points now.

529
00:46:03,400 --> 00:46:05,080
Get serious.

530
00:46:05,080 --> 00:46:08,040
You don't have to go that far.

531
00:46:08,700 --> 00:46:13,860
We should've added more questions and made them run out of time.

532
00:46:13,860 --> 00:46:15,950
The students totally defeated us.

533
00:46:15,950 --> 00:46:20,090
The students understood the text and got the questions right.

534
00:46:20,090 --> 00:46:22,680
We lost if the average score is high

535
00:46:22,680 --> 00:46:25,200
and we won if it's low?

536
00:46:25,200 --> 00:46:28,000
Why would you say such a thing?

537
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:31,080
Because we need to grade them.

538
00:46:31,930 --> 00:46:35,160
We need to line them up, that's why.

539
00:46:35,160 --> 00:46:42,040
That's why we're burning our eyeballs, looking for any errors in the short answers.

540
00:46:42,950 --> 00:46:46,420
We're checking if they paid attention to the lecture.

541
00:46:46,420 --> 00:46:50,280
I hope I get into a car accident after the scores come out.

542
00:46:50,280 --> 00:46:52,100
Why would you...

543
00:46:53,380 --> 00:46:56,170
Don't say stuff like that.

544
00:46:56,170 --> 00:47:00,660
Considering how I'd be harassed by the students and parents, that'd be better.

545
00:47:00,660 --> 00:47:02,840
I'm not afraid of stuff like that.

546
00:47:02,840 --> 00:47:04,270
Will you keep this up—

547
00:47:04,270 --> 00:47:08,370
You must be happy since you aren't afraid.

548
00:47:08,370 --> 00:47:10,060
Hyeon Sil.

549
00:47:10,060 --> 00:47:12,450
You're an educator with tenure.

550
00:47:12,450 --> 00:47:16,210
You aren't the same as adjunct teachers like us.

551
00:47:16,210 --> 00:47:18,670
I wasn't thinking clearly.

552
00:47:18,670 --> 00:47:21,270
I forgot what my position was.

553
00:47:21,270 --> 00:47:23,440
That's enough, Hyeon Sil.

554
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:35,720
An educator with tenure also hates the students' and parents' complaints.

555
00:47:35,720 --> 00:47:38,760
It's not about the position. It's about the values.

556
00:47:40,540 --> 00:47:42,690
What values?

557
00:47:45,030 --> 00:47:48,080
Did you even try to understand my intention?

558
00:47:48,080 --> 00:47:51,920
If the students can understand the text from the curriculum as a whole—

559
00:47:53,130 --> 00:47:55,320
I'll just quit.

560
00:47:56,970 --> 00:47:59,230
Understand the curriculum as a whole?

561
00:47:59,230 --> 00:48:01,980
Who does? The students?

562
00:48:03,310 --> 00:48:06,810
Are you ignorant, or are you pretending?

563
00:48:09,380 --> 00:48:12,540
You worked so hard on the finals preparation.

564
00:48:12,540 --> 00:48:17,040
Ms. Nam and Mr. Lee. Congratulations on doing well on the first exam.

565
00:48:17,040 --> 00:48:20,510
You two lead the students very thoroughly.

566
00:48:20,510 --> 00:48:23,450
Thank you. It was thanks to you.

567
00:48:23,450 --> 00:48:26,080
If it wasn't for you, I wouldn't have been

568
00:48:26,080 --> 00:48:29,820
able to guess Mr. Pyo's direction so well.

569
00:48:29,820 --> 00:48:31,740
I must be lucky.

570
00:48:31,740 --> 00:48:36,000
Good teachers joined us, and you adjusted quickly.

571
00:48:36,900 --> 00:48:41,020
We should have a team dinner sometime.

572
00:48:41,020 --> 00:48:42,640
Sounds good.

573
00:48:43,510 --> 00:48:46,350
Go to a classroom, grab a random student,

574
00:48:46,350 --> 00:48:49,230
and look at the handout they got from the academy.

575
00:48:49,230 --> 00:48:52,150
They make them memorize the notes from both classes

576
00:48:52,150 --> 00:48:55,920
and the handouts a month in advance.

577
00:48:55,920 --> 00:48:59,530
They even know which word you emphasized.

578
00:48:59,530 --> 00:49:02,350
That's the academy's job.

579
00:49:02,350 --> 00:49:05,660
Are we doing this to make the academy teachers proud?

580
00:49:05,660 --> 00:49:10,410
The textbook is the most basic and purest frame of thought.

581
00:49:10,410 --> 00:49:14,520
- Have  faith and—
 - If you care about faith so much,

582
00:49:14,520 --> 00:49:16,640
run for  superintendent or something.

583
00:49:16,640 --> 00:49:20,060
- Hyeon Sil.
 - I told you, I'll quit.

584
00:49:21,440 --> 00:49:26,760
My performance evaluation will obviously be a disaster.

585
00:49:27,610 --> 00:49:31,180
And I'll be tortured by malicious comments.

586
00:49:31,180 --> 00:49:33,540
I'll leave before that happens.

587
00:49:35,490 --> 00:49:41,160
What do you think I should do, then, Ms. Lee?

588
00:49:41,160 --> 00:49:43,950
- Do you really want me to tell you?
 - Yes.

589
00:49:46,270 --> 00:49:49,560
I think we lacked understanding of each other.

590
00:49:51,600 --> 00:49:53,520
Can you...

591
00:49:54,260 --> 00:49:56,730
just do nothing?

592
00:49:58,640 --> 00:50:00,570
Please.

593
00:50:23,040 --> 00:50:25,000
 Seo Hye Jin Korean 

594
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:27,400
 Let's reach for the SKY with Teacher Yun Ji Seok. 

595
00:50:33,290 --> 00:50:35,070
Are you paying tonight, Team Leader?

596
00:50:35,070 --> 00:50:36,890
No, it's the director's treat.

597
00:50:36,890 --> 00:50:39,540
It's because our team got good scores.

598
00:50:41,270 --> 00:50:44,050
He might regret it later.

599
00:51:09,740 --> 00:51:13,600
 Can you just do nothing? 

600
00:51:15,040 --> 00:51:16,910
 Please. 

601
00:51:19,380 --> 00:51:22,780
 Daechi Choeseon Korean - TA Park Gi Seong 

602
00:52:40,930 --> 00:52:46,260
 P 

603
00:52:50,840 --> 00:52:51,950
So?

604
00:52:51,950 --> 00:52:54,010
You want him to be the No. 1 in the country?

605
00:52:54,010 --> 00:52:58,370
Yes. He promised to mention my name during the interview.

606
00:52:59,140 --> 00:53:02,760
Seriously, you're so funny.

607
00:53:03,610 --> 00:53:06,480
- Why are you so funny, Mr. Lee?
 - Ms. Kim...

608
00:53:06,480 --> 00:53:08,550
You're too funny.

609
00:53:10,570 --> 00:53:11,670
Here you go.

610
00:53:11,670 --> 00:53:15,430
Here's the gambas you ordered.

611
00:53:15,430 --> 00:53:18,580
You have to celebrate here on the day you're on TV.

612
00:53:18,580 --> 00:53:19,680
Of course, I will.

613
00:53:19,680 --> 00:53:21,410
Okay, enjoy.

614
00:53:21,410 --> 00:53:23,360
- Thank you.
 - Thank you.

615
00:53:23,360 --> 00:53:24,920
- Enjoy.
 - I will.

616
00:53:24,920 --> 00:53:27,630
Chae Yun, you're drunk.

617
00:53:28,220 --> 00:53:30,780
Huh? No, I'm totally fine.

618
00:53:31,430 --> 00:53:33,330
That student, you know.

619
00:53:33,330 --> 00:53:35,830
I noticed he was different since he attended the free lecture.

620
00:53:35,830 --> 00:53:40,010
Yes. I need to stay alert. He made me nervous.

621
00:53:40,830 --> 00:53:44,470
Neither of you studied Korean, right?

622
00:53:45,880 --> 00:53:48,330
Let me know if you need anything.

623
00:53:48,330 --> 00:53:50,020
I'll help with whatever I can.

624
00:53:50,020 --> 00:53:54,180
Ms. Nam, are you bragging that you studied Korean?

625
00:53:55,010 --> 00:53:56,920
Yes, I tried bragging a bit.

626
00:53:56,920 --> 00:53:58,400
Let's talk about something else.

627
00:53:58,400 --> 00:54:00,460
Why are we being so boring?

628
00:54:00,460 --> 00:54:01,990
Shall we raise our glasses, then?

629
00:54:01,990 --> 00:54:03,640
- Yes.
 - Sounds good.

630
00:54:03,640 --> 00:54:05,570
- Cheers!
 - Cheers!

631
00:54:05,570 --> 00:54:08,160
Cheers, Mr. Lee.

632
00:54:08,160 --> 00:54:12,440
Anyway, what are you doing in the holiday season?

633
00:54:13,720 --> 00:54:16,390
I don't have any special plans.

634
00:54:16,390 --> 00:54:20,000
Why not? Go to Jeju. It's so nice there.

635
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:21,440
- Okay.
 - Oh, right.

636
00:54:21,440 --> 00:54:23,140
Sleepover at my place tonight.

637
00:54:23,140 --> 00:54:25,610
- Your family lives in Jeju, right?
 - It's okay.

638
00:54:25,610 --> 00:54:28,150
- It's even nicer in winter.
 - Are you worried I'd sleep at the academy?

639
00:54:28,150 --> 00:54:31,880
No, I wanted to talk to you more.

640
00:54:32,530 --> 00:54:34,980
- Really?
 - Really.

641
00:54:37,180 --> 00:54:38,730
Let's go to a noraebang.

642
00:54:38,730 --> 00:54:41,420
- Noraebang!  Noraebang!
 - Let's go! Let's go!

643
00:54:41,420 --> 00:54:44,110
- I'll drop Chae Yun off.
 - Thank you.

644
00:54:44,110 --> 00:54:45,770
- Get home safely.
 - Let's go, let's go.

645
00:54:45,770 --> 00:54:50,040
Let's get going. Let's get going.

646
00:54:50,040 --> 00:54:52,630
Mr. Lee, get home safely.

647
00:54:52,630 --> 00:54:54,820
Our taxi is almost here, too.

648
00:54:56,120 --> 00:54:58,520
Huh? Don't you live in this neighborhood?

649
00:54:58,520 --> 00:55:01,580
Well, I moved.

650
00:55:04,040 --> 00:55:06,950
I live in the same neighborhood as Team Leader.

651
00:55:09,280 --> 00:55:11,610
What's with you two?

652
00:55:11,610 --> 00:55:13,530
I'm sorry.

653
00:55:25,160 --> 00:55:26,790
Thank you.

654
00:55:26,790 --> 00:55:28,810
Drive safely.

655
00:55:29,380 --> 00:55:32,240
We'll pick something up. You can go home.

656
00:55:32,240 --> 00:55:33,760
I'll help you carry stuff and leave.

657
00:55:33,760 --> 00:55:36,350
Although I'd prefer it if you two invited me to talk.

658
00:55:36,350 --> 00:55:39,920
That's enough already.

659
00:55:39,920 --> 00:55:42,610
- What?
 - What's with you?

660
00:55:42,610 --> 00:55:45,050
What do you mean? It's just me.

661
00:55:45,770 --> 00:55:47,180
Hello, Ms. Seo.

662
00:55:47,180 --> 00:55:49,060
Seung Gyu, long time no see.

663
00:55:49,060 --> 00:55:50,360
I heard, Ms. Seo.

664
00:55:50,360 --> 00:55:51,720
Oh, okay.

665
00:55:51,720 --> 00:55:54,350
- Aren't you going home?
 - Yes. Gosh.

666
00:55:54,350 --> 00:55:56,210
- Bye.
 - Bye.

667
00:56:11,180 --> 00:56:13,790
This is Ms. Nam Cheong Mi, my teammate.

668
00:56:13,790 --> 00:56:17,450
And this is my friend, Choi Seung Gyu. He's a grad student.

669
00:56:17,450 --> 00:56:20,880
His mother is Manager Kim at our academy.

670
00:56:26,800 --> 00:56:28,370
Gosh, I feel better.

671
00:56:28,370 --> 00:56:31,080
I thought I was dying from frustration.

672
00:56:31,080 --> 00:56:32,920
We've met somewhere, right?

673
00:56:32,920 --> 00:56:35,880
Yes, at your apartment complex.

674
00:56:35,880 --> 00:56:38,650
I was right.

675
00:56:38,650 --> 00:56:42,390
I learned that Mr. Pyo moved to Daechi-dong,

676
00:56:42,390 --> 00:56:44,440
so I visited Manager Kim.

677
00:56:44,440 --> 00:56:47,570
I also wanted to ask if I could start a Chanyeong High class.

678
00:56:49,750 --> 00:56:52,070
Can you just talk about stuff like that?

679
00:56:52,070 --> 00:56:54,660
Isn't it some sort of a trade secret?

680
00:56:54,660 --> 00:56:56,220
It's all in the past.

681
00:56:56,220 --> 00:56:58,680
I hate having secrets.

682
00:57:00,060 --> 00:57:01,580
Hello.

683
00:57:01,580 --> 00:57:04,210
- Thank you.
 - Enjoy.

684
00:57:08,730 --> 00:57:10,400
There are students like that.

685
00:57:10,400 --> 00:57:12,880
They can understand things logically,

686
00:57:12,880 --> 00:57:16,370
but they get discouraged by literature, which requires imagination and empathy.

687
00:57:16,370 --> 00:57:18,520
It's not actually their fault

688
00:57:18,520 --> 00:57:22,300
because neither the academy nor school teaches them how to read properly.

689
00:57:22,300 --> 00:57:27,260
And it requires a lot of courage, too.

690
00:57:27,260 --> 00:57:31,590
Are you able to be imaginative and empathetic during exams?

691
00:57:31,590 --> 00:57:33,950
Isn't that too idealistic?

692
00:57:40,110 --> 00:57:45,940
During the 12th-grade city-wide mock test in 2013,

693
00:57:45,940 --> 00:57:48,810
the classroom full of students cried.

694
00:57:48,810 --> 00:57:50,990
Because of the No Hui Gyeong text?

695
00:57:50,990 --> 00:57:52,900
Yes.

696
00:57:52,900 --> 00:57:57,160
The mother who's been caring for her senile mother-in-law and raising her children,

697
00:57:57,160 --> 00:58:00,920
taking good care of her husband suddenly

698
00:58:00,920 --> 00:58:03,010
gets diagnosed with cancer.

699
00:58:03,010 --> 00:58:08,070
It's a story about her dying after saying goodbye to her family one by one.

700
00:58:08,070 --> 00:58:10,760
The last part of the piece was in the exam.

701
00:58:10,760 --> 00:58:14,520
The students cried a lot during the exam.

702
00:58:15,640 --> 00:58:19,310
It's possible to be imaginative and empathetic during an exam, too.

703
00:58:19,310 --> 00:58:21,630
Of course, it won't guarantee you any points.

704
00:58:21,630 --> 00:58:24,960
Come on, that's not good.

705
00:58:25,720 --> 00:58:29,040
Hey. You'd better not teach them like that.

706
00:58:29,990 --> 00:58:32,360
Just focus on the academy's duty.

707
00:58:32,360 --> 00:58:34,310
What's the academy's duty?

708
00:58:34,310 --> 00:58:37,740
It's repetitive training and memorizing the key points.

709
00:58:37,740 --> 00:58:41,600
Send a ton of them to medical school and get yourself known.

710
00:58:41,600 --> 00:58:43,730
Won't you buy a building?

711
00:58:44,570 --> 00:58:46,980
- I will.
 - Yes.

712
00:58:48,710 --> 00:58:55,670
Also, literature, history, aesthetics, and philosophy...

713
00:58:55,670 --> 00:58:58,850
Stuff like that shouldn't be taught in depth.

714
00:58:58,850 --> 00:59:03,230
I ended up studying history because of my score,

715
00:59:03,230 --> 00:59:05,850
but don't make them interested in that.

716
00:59:07,310 --> 00:59:09,760
How did you end up, exactly?

717
00:59:11,370 --> 00:59:13,010
Well...

718
00:59:14,610 --> 00:59:18,820
My hands get shaky even when I order delivery food.

719
00:59:18,820 --> 00:59:21,640
I'm a poor scholar.

720
00:59:21,640 --> 00:59:23,220
A useless human.

721
00:59:23,220 --> 00:59:26,520
Oh, yeah. And a reject of society?

722
00:59:28,710 --> 00:59:31,390
Why would you say stuff like that?

723
00:59:33,600 --> 00:59:38,710
If everyone approaches studies like we do in Daechi-dong,

724
00:59:38,710 --> 00:59:41,230
the world would be doomed.

725
00:59:41,230 --> 00:59:45,950
- Pardon?
 - Studying itself allowed humanity to advance this much.

726
00:59:45,950 --> 00:59:49,460
You're supposed to be a scholar. Why do you talk that way?

727
00:59:49,460 --> 00:59:51,300
How pathetic.

728
00:59:53,810 --> 00:59:55,360
Pardon?

729
00:59:56,880 --> 01:00:03,720
I'm curious why Si Wu fell in love with you two teachers.

730
01:00:07,250 --> 01:00:10,000
Your free lecture...

731
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:12,750
I thought it was nice, but...

732
01:00:12,750 --> 01:00:16,350
it had nothing to do with exam techniques.

733
01:00:16,350 --> 01:00:19,180
I think so, too,

734
01:00:19,820 --> 01:00:25,230
but I'm not sure if they're completely unrelated.

735
01:00:28,840 --> 01:00:32,590
Let me know if you find the answer.

736
01:00:53,240 --> 01:00:57,360
Can I ask you why you keep sleeping in my bed?

737
01:00:59,330 --> 01:01:03,200
Hey, give me her phone number.

738
01:01:03,200 --> 01:01:05,270
That teacher from earlier.

739
01:01:05,270 --> 01:01:08,160
I could've won the argument if I hadn't been drinking.

740
01:01:10,230 --> 01:01:11,810
Go to sleep.

741
01:01:13,760 --> 01:01:16,280
Geez, what a bastard.

742
01:01:23,270 --> 01:01:26,420
 Winter Break Special Lecture 

743
01:01:42,400 --> 01:01:44,710
Where's Ms. Nam?

744
01:01:44,710 --> 01:01:47,560
She said she'd get a bedsore on her butt while working on her teaching material.

745
01:01:47,560 --> 01:01:49,600
She wanted to take a walk.

746
01:01:49,600 --> 01:01:52,670
- Are you okay? 
- My butt?

747
01:01:52,670 --> 01:01:54,720
You know since you saw it last night—

748
01:01:54,720 --> 01:01:58,970
Seriously. You're out of your mind.

749
01:02:01,090 --> 01:02:02,760
Was it okay?

750
01:02:05,150 --> 01:02:06,890
All right.

751
01:02:08,790 --> 01:02:11,770
You look so great since you're so slim.

752
01:02:11,770 --> 01:02:15,470
You look like a completely different person now.

753
01:02:16,180 --> 01:02:17,820
Would you like to go with this one?

754
01:02:17,820 --> 01:02:19,650
Yes.

755
01:02:19,650 --> 01:02:21,780
- I'll pay.
 - Okay.

756
01:02:33,880 --> 01:02:39,980
The Director wants to get dinner if you're available.

757
01:02:39,980 --> 01:02:44,760
I'm sorry, but I have plans tonight.

758
01:02:45,980 --> 01:02:48,620
I'll let her know,

759
01:02:48,620 --> 01:02:50,330
Assistant Director.

760
01:02:53,450 --> 01:02:55,070
Well,

761
01:02:55,870 --> 01:02:58,220
the resignation letter hasn't been processed yet.

762
01:02:58,220 --> 01:03:00,640
I feel uneasy hearing that.

763
01:03:00,640 --> 01:03:04,620
And you're a TA, Mr. Park.

764
01:03:04,620 --> 01:03:08,680
You don't have to act as my aide.

765
01:03:08,680 --> 01:03:12,600
No, that's not right, Assistant Director.

766
01:03:14,320 --> 01:03:16,220
Where are you headed to?

767
01:03:16,220 --> 01:03:18,340
Let me drive you there.

768
01:03:18,340 --> 01:03:20,270
I'm sorry,

769
01:03:21,440 --> 01:03:23,830
but please take these.

770
01:03:25,240 --> 01:03:27,150
You need to tell the students about this.

771
01:03:27,150 --> 01:03:29,520
It's a new grammar rule according to the new curriculum.

772
01:03:29,520 --> 01:03:33,570
You have to check the teachers' answers for the school exams.

773
01:03:33,570 --> 01:03:34,980
Let's look at the reading comprehension.

774
01:03:34,980 --> 01:03:38,150
You keep underestimating the students.

775
01:03:38,150 --> 01:03:40,860
They're different than when you studied.

776
01:03:40,860 --> 01:03:44,920
I'm not underestimating them. I'm teaching them the basics.

777
01:03:44,920 --> 01:03:46,690
Open it.

778
01:03:54,030 --> 01:03:55,840
Don't you regret it?

779
01:03:56,730 --> 01:03:58,260
Regret what?

780
01:03:58,910 --> 01:04:02,630
If you'd kept your job, you would've been promoted by now.

781
01:04:02,630 --> 01:04:04,680
Deputy Lee Jun Ho.

782
01:04:06,210 --> 01:04:08,680
I prefer being called teacher.

783
01:04:13,950 --> 01:04:16,650
Yes, Team Leader Choi.

784
01:04:16,650 --> 01:04:19,150
Of course, I'm at work.

785
01:04:22,110 --> 01:04:24,520
I don't have a consultation today.

786
01:04:24,520 --> 01:04:28,130
I don't think it's for consultation.

787
01:04:28,130 --> 01:04:31,660
He said you'd know the name "Pyo Sang Seob".

788

 Timing and Subtitles by Lessons in Love Team @ Viki.com 

789
01:05:11,660 --> 01:05:15,670
 The Midnight Romance in Hagwon 

790
01:05:17,640 --> 01:05:20,250
 I'll be working for Choeseon Korean. 

791
01:05:20,250 --> 01:05:23,350
 - What did you just say...
 - Didn't you want word of mouth? 

792
01:05:23,350 --> 01:05:25,410
 Purely for your own good. 

793
01:05:25,410 --> 01:05:26,750
 It's my fault, I said. 

794
01:05:26,750 --> 01:05:28,950
 I want to go back in time. 

795
01:05:28,950 --> 01:05:30,170
 It's just a phone number. 

796
01:05:30,170 --> 01:05:32,080
 She's not interested in you at all. 

797
01:05:32,080 --> 01:05:36,030
 Aren't you hoping she'll fail in case she might steal the Chanyeong students? 

798
01:05:36,030 --> 01:05:39,200
 I support you. Fighting. 

799
01:05:39,200 --> 01:05:41,200
 But she's a very strong person. 

800
01:05:41,200 --> 01:05:42,810
 Of course, she is. 

801
01:05:42,810 --> 01:05:44,820
 But people like that get hurt, too. 

802
01:05:44,820 --> 01:05:46,830
 I still want to be with you. 

803
01:05:46,830 --> 01:05:49,000
 I'll just be by your side.
