You didn't make photocopies...

to keep, did you?

12
00:01:09,899 --> 00:01:11,169
Even if you did,

13
00:01:11,940 --> 00:01:13,539
there's a solution for that too.

14
00:01:14,380 --> 00:01:16,380
We got stabbed in the back before.

15
00:01:18,949 --> 00:01:19,979
Well...

16
00:01:20,350 --> 00:01:23,050
No, it's fine. You can go now.

17
00:01:23,080 --> 00:01:25,190
Don't you need to give me a receipt or something...

18
00:01:26,149 --> 00:01:28,059
that says I returned the books?

19
00:01:28,990 --> 00:01:29,990
What?

20
00:01:30,160 --> 00:01:32,459
What if you say I didn't return them?

21
00:01:36,759 --> 00:01:38,369

34
00:02:59,650 --> 00:03:00,650
A tablet PC.

35
00:03:00,850 --> 00:03:03,280
The one you're using seems old.

36
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:06,289
Why did you get one?

37
00:03:07,889 --> 00:03:10,918
I saw it when I went to get a new phone.

38
00:03:10,919 --> 00:03:13,460
It was pretty and I thought of you.

39
00:03:16,930 --> 00:03:17,970
Director.

40
00:03:18,329 --> 00:03:19,930
Will you accept it?

41
00:03:24,410 --> 00:03:25,470
I...

42
00:03:26,340 --> 00:03:28,310
got an offer from another academy.

43
00:03:30,710 --> 00:03:31,710
I see.

44
00:03:33,810 --> 00:03:34,850
Did you?

45
00:03:36,449 --> 00:03:37,479
When?

46
00:03:39,690 --> 00:03:41,090
Recently, it just so happened.

47
00:03:42,259 --> 00:03:43,259
Still,

48
00:03:44,359 --> 00:03:45,560
take it.

49
00:03:48,299 --> 00:03:50,060
Call it a farewell present.

50
00:03:53,470 --> 00:03:56,069
I want something bigger when we really say farewell.

51
00:03:57,710 --> 00:03:58,739
What?

52
00:04:00,269 --> 00:04:01,780
- Then... - I won't leave.

53
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:06,209
- You won't? - Shall I?

54
00:04:06,210 --> 00:04:09,279
No. That's not what I mean.

55
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:11,889
Give this to Ms. Nam.

56
00:04:12,549 --> 00:04:13,549
Ms. Nam?

57
00:04:13,550 --> 00:04:15,319
She works hardest and best.

58
00:04:15,590 --> 00:04:18,989
Encourage and support the new hires.

59
00:04:19,690 --> 00:04:20,729
Gosh.

60
00:04:22,429 --> 00:04:24,299
I'm a good judge of character.

61
00:04:26,299 --> 00:04:28,900
You're magnanimous and understanding.

62
00:04:29,499 --> 00:04:31,939
Altruistic and bold.

63
00:04:32,239 --> 00:04:34,910
It wasn't that. Heewon High class...

64
00:04:35,340 --> 00:04:37,080
I want to do well with that class.

65
00:04:37,439 --> 00:04:38,450
Okay.

66
00:04:40,510 --> 00:04:41,618
I have a class soon.

67
00:04:41,619 --> 00:04:43,320
Oh, yes. You should go.

68
00:04:43,379 --> 00:04:45,549
You have a long day. Sorry for keeping you.

69
00:04:51,530 --> 00:04:53,890
Wait. Could you...

70
00:04:55,460 --> 00:04:58,830
tell me which academy made an offer?

71
00:05:00,900 --> 00:05:02,169
Where do you think it was?

72
00:05:02,999 --> 00:05:04,539
- Was it... - Was it?

73
00:05:05,710 --> 00:05:07,210
Choisun Academy?

74
00:05:26,330 --> 00:05:29,629

75
00:05:30,900 --> 00:05:33,369
Send a text to the Chanyoung High moms.

76
00:05:34,939 --> 00:05:37,600
There won't be a special lecture for their kids' final exam.

77
00:05:39,010 --> 00:05:41,939
Even if you don't teach it yourself,

78
00:05:42,210 --> 00:05:44,439
you could assign another instructor.

79
00:05:46,179 --> 00:05:47,280
Mr. Park.

80
00:05:48,749 --> 00:05:51,820
You want me to take the leftovers?

81
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:55,720
I apologize.

82
00:05:56,660 --> 00:05:59,830
Bring the Chanyoung High material we reviewed last time.

83
00:06:00,789 --> 00:06:02,400
Yes, Director.

84
00:06:03,999 --> 00:06:05,200
You can go.

85
00:06:05,999 --> 00:06:08,700
Okay. But I have something.

86
00:06:12,809 --> 00:06:14,710
- Here. - What is it?

87
00:06:15,340 --> 00:06:17,280
Take a look.

88
00:06:24,850 --> 00:06:25,950
What is this?

89
00:06:26,989 --> 00:06:30,119
Si Woo came to return his books, so I had him write and sign it.

90
00:06:30,919 --> 00:06:33,928
I don't know if the kid's twisted because his family's poor,

91
00:06:33,929 --> 00:06:36,798
or if he was trying to hide his inferiority complex,

92
00:06:36,799 --> 00:06:38,428
but he showed no remorse at all.

93
00:06:38,429 --> 00:06:40,729
Did he ask to write this himself?

94
00:06:41,539 --> 00:06:44,439
No. I told him to write and sign it.

95
00:06:58,989 --> 00:06:59,989
Get out.

96
00:07:03,460 --> 00:07:04,460
Darn you.

What did we get with this?

100
00:07:21,140 --> 00:07:23,539
You dared to use Choisun Academy's name...

101
00:07:23,679 --> 00:07:26,879
to get a snotty kid to sign a rag like this?

102
00:07:27,879 --> 00:07:28,919
I apologize.

103
00:07:29,179 --> 00:07:30,179
Get out.

104
00:07:31,119 --> 00:07:33,390
Stay out of my sight forever!

105
00:07:35,890 --> 00:07:37,189
Forgive me.

106
00:07:55,679 --> 00:07:56,679
Mr. Lee.

107
00:07:56,739 --> 00:07:58,010
Is everything okay?

108
00:07:58,549 --> 00:08:00,309
Did you go through the material I sent?

109
00:08:04,280 --> 00:08:07,119
Yes, that's right. Ms. Seo seemed worried.

110
00:08:07,789 --> 00:08:09,390
I'm not a kid.

111
00:08:14,359 --> 00:08:16,059
Okay. See you next week.

112
00:08:32,109 --> 00:08:34,479
Wherever you go, study hard.

113
00:08:34,950 --> 00:08:36,479
I root for you always.

114
00:08:36,950 --> 00:08:38,749
Choisun Academy, Choi Hyung Sun.

115
00:08:42,619 --> 00:08:44,420
Is Ms. Seo worried about something?

116
00:08:46,190 --> 00:08:48,859
We have a Heewon High kid who used to go to Choisun Academy.

117
00:08:49,060 --> 00:08:50,859
She saw him go in to return his books.

118
00:08:56,639 --> 00:08:57,899
I should nag a bit.

119
00:08:59,710 --> 00:09:00,940
To me?

120
00:09:01,310 --> 00:09:02,639
No, to Hye Jin.

121
00:09:04,210 --> 00:09:06,149
Even if she made up her mind, people will talk...

122
00:09:07,580 --> 00:09:08,779
if they see her there.

123
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:14,320
What?

124
00:09:15,420 --> 00:09:18,359
She said you knew about her decision.

125
00:09:21,460 --> 00:09:24,359
Ms. Seo changed her mind.

126
00:09:28,739 --> 00:09:29,999
She told me she'd leave.

127
00:09:31,570 --> 00:09:33,909
Ask her yourself. It's not for me to say.

128
00:09:36,779 --> 00:09:39,509
- Okay. I'll do that. - Bye, then.

129
00:09:41,879 --> 00:09:44,220
Hey. Thanks for the tip.

130
00:09:47,119 --> 00:09:48,888
You. Go back to your classroom.

131
00:09:48,889 --> 00:09:49,889
- Okay. - Okay.

132
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:51,790
- Good luck with your class. - Thanks.

133
00:09:53,430 --> 00:09:55,960
I'll get a seat and wait in time for the end of your morning class.

134
00:09:56,859 --> 00:09:58,229
I hope to see you.

135
00:10:00,700 --> 00:10:03,239
Did you promise her a different profit split...

136
00:10:03,540 --> 00:10:04,639
or another incentive?

137
00:10:04,970 --> 00:10:06,009
No, I didn't.

138
00:10:12,050 --> 00:10:15,080
She wants to do well with the Heewon High class.

139
00:10:17,249 --> 00:10:18,619
What kind of reason is that?

140
00:10:20,649 --> 00:10:22,960
I reviewed Ms. Seo's contract.

141
00:10:24,460 --> 00:10:27,930
On paper, it won't be easy for her to leave and steal our students.

142
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:30,800
But how about we give her a warning?

143
00:10:32,070 --> 00:10:33,899
- Ms. Woo. - Yes?

144
00:10:34,670 --> 00:10:38,040
It's not the time to assault an ally.

145
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:40,310
What do you mean "assault?"

146
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:42,909
That sounds a bit...

147
00:10:43,739 --> 00:10:46,409
The world we live in,

148
00:10:46,580 --> 00:10:48,879
this academy industry. It's a true jungle.

149
00:10:49,050 --> 00:10:50,119
It is.

150
00:10:50,519 --> 00:10:52,019
Don't you think...

151
00:10:52,350 --> 00:10:54,148
now is the time for us to show...

152
00:10:54,149 --> 00:10:57,590
we trust our instructors and support them staunchly?

153
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:23,779
We have ten more minutes. Shall we read a short passage?

154
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:29,619
No?

155
00:11:34,759 --> 00:11:36,259
The next passage.

156
00:11:37,430 --> 00:11:39,129
I really hope you study it.

157
00:11:39,269 --> 00:11:40,999
Shoot. I knew it.

158
00:11:41,639 --> 00:11:44,800
Okay? It's Erich Fromm's "The Art of Loving."

159
00:11:45,269 --> 00:11:48,439
"Love is the active interest in the life and growth..."

160
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:50,310
"of the person you love."

161
00:11:50,479 --> 00:11:52,180
That's a great quote.

162
00:11:52,909 --> 00:11:56,350
Doesn't it prove just how much I love you?

163
00:12:44,830 --> 00:12:45,830
Did you have lunch?

164
00:12:46,399 --> 00:12:48,340
I don't have to eat to feel full.

165
00:12:50,470 --> 00:12:53,509
I brought a packed lunch. Shall we share? It's enough for two.

166
00:12:55,540 --> 00:12:59,210
I have a feeling one-half of that wasn't originally for me.

167
00:12:59,979 --> 00:13:01,050
You're right.

168
00:13:02,220 --> 00:13:05,149
I don't have to pay you back for it, then?

169
00:13:06,149 --> 00:13:08,519
I knew you were shrewd.

Once Jun Ho moves out too,

172
00:13:21,430 --> 00:13:23,499
the apartment will feel too big.

173
00:13:30,540 --> 00:13:32,009
I worked so hard to raise them,

174
00:13:32,450 --> 00:13:33,909
but sons are just boring.

175
00:13:44,019 --> 00:13:45,759
I guess he decided to...

176
00:13:45,889 --> 00:13:47,888
come home early until he moves out.

177
00:13:47,889 --> 00:13:49,029
He still cares.

178
00:13:52,029 --> 00:13:54,268
- I'm home. - You're back early.

179
00:13:54,269 --> 00:13:55,769
- I'm home. - What's that for?

180
00:13:56,070 --> 00:13:57,300
I'm here to pack.

181
00:13:57,899 --> 00:13:58,908
Already?

182
00:13:58,909 --> 00:14:01,409
I won't have much time after the special lectures start.

183
00:14:02,109 --> 00:14:03,278
But still, you...

184
00:14:03,279 --> 00:14:05,050
I had dinner, Mom. Good night.

185
00:14:05,409 --> 00:14:06,409

Where's the lunchbox?

187
00:14:12,450 --> 00:14:13,450
What's that?

188
00:14:14,050 --> 00:14:16,659
I found a pretty good side dish shop.

189
00:14:21,159 --> 00:14:23,729
I brought some from home because it's perfect with alcohol.

190
00:14:24,430 --> 00:14:25,800
Not knowing you wouldn't drink.

191
00:14:26,869 --> 00:14:27,899
Sorry.

192
00:14:27,930 --> 00:14:30,399
My throat dries up if I drink before a morning class.

193
00:14:30,940 --> 00:14:33,269
You're such a dedicated teacher.

194
00:14:34,239 --> 00:14:37,739
How did the likes of you ask to see me on a weekend?

195
00:14:38,139 --> 00:14:40,609
I didn't want to go to an empty home today.

196
00:14:41,850 --> 00:14:43,080
You feel lonely too?

197
00:14:44,119 --> 00:14:45,619
I'm human too.

198
00:14:46,090 --> 00:14:47,690
Hey, then shall we get...

199
00:14:47,749 --> 00:14:50,889
the once-scrapped blind date project back on track?

200
00:14:53,290 --> 00:14:56,460
Yes? I'll bring you only the greatest catches.

201
00:14:57,960 --> 00:14:59,430
Not at my age.

202
00:15:01,330 --> 00:15:02,899
Dating is nonsense.

203
00:15:03,970 --> 00:15:04,970
Hey.

204
00:15:05,210 --> 00:15:08,878
Don't you know retirement homes are rife with affairs,

205
00:15:08,879 --> 00:15:10,139
passion, and love triangles?

206
00:15:11,409 --> 00:15:13,210
Even when I'm in a retirement home,

207
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:15,920
I won't be a part of any passionate affair.

208
00:15:16,080 --> 00:15:17,680
I'll probably just sit and watch.

209
00:15:20,649 --> 00:15:22,659
Why would you say something so chilling?

210
00:15:23,420 --> 00:15:25,930
I don't know. I just can't relate to it.

211
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:27,560
Why not?

212
00:15:29,259 --> 00:15:30,359
Why not?

213
00:15:35,070 --> 00:15:36,700
Why not?

214
00:15:38,509 --> 00:15:39,509
Aren't I...

215
00:15:42,080 --> 00:15:44,009
a cogwheel that's slightly askew?

216
00:15:45,310 --> 00:15:46,310
What cogwheel?

217
00:15:48,180 --> 00:15:49,850
It doesn't apply to everyone,

218
00:15:50,149 --> 00:15:52,018
but in general, people of similar ages...

219
00:15:52,019 --> 00:15:54,149
have similar goals and priorities.

220
00:15:55,460 --> 00:15:57,920
In high school, getting into college is a priority.

221
00:15:58,259 --> 00:16:01,629
Once in college, you care about studying or dating.

222
00:16:01,960 --> 00:16:03,959
Around the last year there you look for work,

223
00:16:03,960 --> 00:16:06,829
and once that's sorted, you slowly consider marriage.

224
00:16:06,830 --> 00:16:09,669
Yes. And once you marry and have a kid or two,

225
00:16:09,670 --> 00:16:11,169
getting into college becomes a priority again.

226
00:16:11,170 --> 00:16:12,970
Right. But not for me.

227
00:16:13,170 --> 00:16:15,179
While my college friends studied and dated,

228
00:16:15,180 --> 00:16:16,409
I worked like crazy for money.

229
00:16:16,879 --> 00:16:18,039
When you sat the last bar exam,

230
00:16:18,040 --> 00:16:19,550
I hadn't even graduated yet.

231
00:16:21,180 --> 00:16:22,519
My gosh.

232
00:16:23,180 --> 00:16:25,189
Creditors came after us every single day,

233
00:16:25,190 --> 00:16:26,720
and my brother was still in school.

234
00:16:28,220 --> 00:16:30,619
By the time I didn't have to worry about money,

235
00:16:31,220 --> 00:16:33,059
the grades of other people's kids had become my priority.

236
00:16:33,060 --> 00:16:36,830
It's like my clock doesn't tick in time with someone else's.

237
00:16:37,729 --> 00:16:40,499
Do you think your cogwheel will stay askew...

238
00:16:40,570 --> 00:16:43,070
until you move into a retirement home?

239
00:16:43,340 --> 00:16:46,109
I did my best and worked hard on all my given assignments.

240
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:49,080
And I got this far.

241
00:16:49,979 --> 00:16:52,080
But I never had a decent boyfriend.

242
00:16:52,109 --> 00:16:54,810
I'm just saying life isn't fair.

243
00:16:55,879 --> 00:16:57,580
That sounds so cowardly.

244
00:16:59,790 --> 00:17:01,960
When my husband and I were all fired up with passion,

245
00:17:02,060 --> 00:17:03,560
I passed the first round of the bar.

246
00:17:04,060 --> 00:17:05,119
Don't you remember?

247
00:17:06,389 --> 00:17:07,430
You did.

248
00:17:08,899 --> 00:17:10,898
- I remember. - My gosh.

249
00:17:10,899 --> 00:17:12,699
It was such a sweaty summer.

250
00:17:13,199 --> 00:17:14,698
My studio wasn't just cold.

251
00:17:14,699 --> 00:17:17,368
The walls were paper thin too.

252
00:17:17,369 --> 00:17:19,309
- You're crazy. - We stayed close...

253
00:17:19,310 --> 00:17:20,639
in that heat.

254
00:17:21,709 --> 00:17:23,839
Who would have known clothes so thin...

255
00:17:23,840 --> 00:17:26,378
- could be so cumbersome? - Stop it.

256
00:17:26,379 --> 00:17:28,378
- No one had to give a signal. - Stop.

257
00:17:28,379 --> 00:17:29,718
- We both... - Stop!

258
00:17:29,719 --> 00:17:31,750
Do you have to go into such detail?

259
00:17:31,820 --> 00:17:33,020
Drink some more.

260
00:17:34,389 --> 00:17:36,020
- My gosh. - It's true that...

261
00:17:36,459 --> 00:17:39,189
you had to grow up before the rest of us.

262
00:17:40,790 --> 00:17:42,459
But I don't think that's the reason...

263
00:17:42,730 --> 00:17:44,830
you never dated properly.

264
00:17:47,070 --> 00:17:48,070
What is, then?

265
00:17:49,899 --> 00:17:52,608
Either you're an idiot who has too big an expectation...

266
00:17:52,609 --> 00:17:54,109
or illusion of love...

267
00:17:56,609 --> 00:17:58,310
Or you're an idiot who thought too little of it.

268
00:18:02,550 --> 00:18:04,419
Which do you think I am?

269
00:18:04,949 --> 00:18:06,050
The latter.

270
00:18:08,590 --> 00:18:11,289
You paid off a huge debt at a young age,

271
00:18:11,290 --> 00:18:12,590
and that was really impressive.

272
00:18:14,490 --> 00:18:16,760
You're pretty successful too.

273
00:18:17,030 --> 00:18:18,730
Money, a car, an apartment.

274
00:18:18,969 --> 00:18:22,199
Once you get the things that everyone works for,

275
00:18:23,169 --> 00:18:25,840
it becomes pretty easy to deceive yourself.

276
00:18:26,139 --> 00:18:28,070
You tell yourself you don't need love.

277
00:18:30,280 --> 00:18:31,840
And you act all cool and posh.

278
00:18:31,909 --> 00:18:32,949
Yes.

279
00:18:33,449 --> 00:18:34,949
After you do that for a while,

280
00:18:35,719 --> 00:18:38,550
it gets a bit awkward and embarrassing...

281
00:18:38,820 --> 00:18:41,959
to say you want to fall in love too.

282
00:18:43,159 --> 00:18:46,090
So you have no choice but to deceive yourself again.

283
00:18:48,530 --> 00:18:49,560
But...

284
00:18:51,359 --> 00:18:53,199
what if I lie and deceive,

285
00:18:55,740 --> 00:18:57,899
but I don't fall for it anymore?

286
00:18:59,609 --> 00:19:00,869
What then?

287
00:19:05,580 --> 00:19:06,850
Is this...

288
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:10,050
related to what you said last time?

289
00:19:12,449 --> 00:19:14,649
About not being able to go back to the past.

290
00:19:18,219 --> 00:19:19,790
One beer should be fine.

291
00:19:28,939 --> 00:19:29,939
How lovely.

292
00:19:56,929 --> 00:19:59,000
Today was a really close one.

293
00:19:59,100 --> 00:20:01,500
I acted like I was his instructor and all.

294
00:20:01,669 --> 00:20:03,739
Today, I almost ended my class early...

295
00:20:03,740 --> 00:20:05,668
to go out and eat lunch with him.

296
00:20:05,669 --> 00:20:07,468
I barely regained control.

297
00:20:07,469 --> 00:20:10,409
Hey. Lunch is nothing at all.

298
00:20:11,040 --> 00:20:14,049
Hey. I was and am his instructor.

299
00:20:14,050 --> 00:20:15,309
I can't get drawn in.

300
00:20:15,310 --> 00:20:18,919
I should slam down the brakes.

301
00:20:22,719 --> 00:20:23,919
He has a lot of qualities.

302
00:20:27,260 --> 00:20:28,490
He's cheerful,

303
00:20:29,500 --> 00:20:30,800
sweet,

304
00:20:31,730 --> 00:20:32,899
and responsible.

305
00:20:35,469 --> 00:20:38,240
My job is to help him reach his goal.

306
00:20:39,540 --> 00:20:42,040
I don't want him to become gossip over something silly.

307
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:45,580
Aren't I cool?

308
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:47,810
Okay, let's say you are.

309
00:20:48,149 --> 00:20:51,319
I get that you want to think so.

310
00:20:51,320 --> 00:20:53,550
- I get it completely. - Okay.

311
00:20:55,119 --> 00:20:57,889
You said you didn't think you were falling for it anymore.

312
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:04,359
How do you really feel? Honestly.

313
00:21:30,689 --> 00:21:32,389
You saw him, didn't you?

314
00:21:32,889 --> 00:21:34,030
I saw him.

315
00:21:37,830 --> 00:21:39,129
Can you...

316
00:21:44,740 --> 00:21:46,270
not fall for Jun Ho?

317
00:21:52,510 --> 00:21:54,109
Tell me if there's a way.

318
00:22:06,659 --> 00:22:08,959
Gosh. I had this.

319
00:22:23,340 --> 00:22:24,709
Why are you crying?

320
00:22:24,909 --> 00:22:26,050
I don't know.

321
00:22:27,310 --> 00:22:28,580
I must be drunk.

322
00:22:32,590 --> 00:22:34,320
It was sweet and scary.

323
00:22:35,219 --> 00:22:36,520
What was?

324
00:22:37,459 --> 00:22:38,459
Well...

325
00:22:41,490 --> 00:22:43,830
He said that I was...

326
00:22:44,699 --> 00:22:46,129
his first love.

327
00:22:47,570 --> 00:22:49,569
If he were to know I'm an idiot,

328
00:22:49,570 --> 00:22:52,709
he might snap out of the fantasy he had of me.

329
00:22:53,770 --> 00:22:54,770
Hey.

330
00:22:55,540 --> 00:22:57,810
Why do you want to be part of a fantasy?

331
00:22:59,149 --> 00:23:02,320
Just throw yourself and let instinct take over.

332
00:23:03,719 --> 00:23:05,280
That's harder than you think.

333
00:23:09,119 --> 00:23:10,859
You frustrating thing.

334
00:23:16,560 --> 00:23:17,929
I bet it's Jun Ho.

335
00:23:18,830 --> 00:23:20,030
Shall we bet a grand?

336
00:23:20,570 --> 00:23:22,869
- Yes. - How do you know?

337
00:23:24,070 --> 00:23:25,709
"How was your drive home?"

338
00:23:26,209 --> 00:23:29,239
"Did you get back safely? When will you go to bed?"

339
00:23:29,240 --> 00:23:31,109
He's the only one who asks such questions at odd times.

340
00:23:32,310 --> 00:23:35,010
That's how I found out how it feels to be lonely.

341
00:23:35,480 --> 00:23:37,149
Why do you feel lonely?

342
00:23:37,679 --> 00:23:40,689
I'm dead jealous a younger man texts you at night.

343
00:23:42,119 --> 00:23:43,119
Yes.

344
00:23:43,590 --> 00:23:45,730
It feels so strange when he doesn't text at night.

345
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:51,159
He'll be asking if I got home safe.

346
00:23:51,500 --> 00:23:52,830
I didn't see him leave tonight.

347
00:24:03,780 --> 00:24:04,840
What is it?

348
00:24:07,580 --> 00:24:10,149
I won't ask for the 1,000 dollars. Who was it?

349
00:24:13,320 --> 00:24:15,149
- Well? - It was Jun Ho.

350
00:24:17,290 --> 00:24:18,290
But what?

351
00:24:23,959 --> 00:24:26,000
Hey. What is it?

352
00:24:28,939 --> 00:24:30,899
They're the notes you gave me.

353
00:24:32,439 --> 00:24:33,669
Tenacious Seo Hye Jin.

354
00:24:35,270 --> 00:24:38,040
You tried so hard to get Lee Jun Ho to study.

355
00:24:39,510 --> 00:24:40,879
The day I studied hard.

356
00:24:41,810 --> 00:24:43,649
The day I skipped class to go to an internet cafe.

357
00:24:45,050 --> 00:24:47,050
The day I did well in an exam and the day I didn't.

358
00:24:48,020 --> 00:24:50,020
The day it was hot, the day it was cold.

359
00:24:51,260 --> 00:24:53,330
The day I found an interesting book in the library.

360
00:24:54,189 --> 00:24:55,830
The day we rented comic books together.

361
00:24:56,859 --> 00:24:58,500
The day we solved a math problem together.

362
00:24:59,629 --> 00:25:01,570
The day we started counting down to the KSAT.

363
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:02,869
The day before the KSAT.

364
00:25:03,540 --> 00:25:04,570
The day of the KSAT.

365
00:25:05,540 --> 00:25:07,340
The day I got my certificate of admission and...

366
00:25:09,480 --> 00:25:10,810
Even when it was an ordinary day.

367
00:25:12,449 --> 00:25:14,810
I guess you had a lot to say to me.

368
00:25:17,250 --> 00:25:20,490
Why are you crying?

369
00:25:25,929 --> 00:25:29,030
Hey. You were a great teacher.

370
00:25:29,359 --> 00:25:31,560
I'm not a great teacher.

371
00:25:31,730 --> 00:25:32,770
Come on.

372
00:25:34,070 --> 00:25:35,500
He's saying that...

373
00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:39,240
because of you, he got through those tough times.

374
00:25:40,409 --> 00:25:42,378
Something like that means...

375
00:25:42,379 --> 00:25:44,739
I didn't do this for any of the other kids.

376
00:25:44,740 --> 00:25:45,750
What?

377
00:25:46,709 --> 00:25:48,379
I only did that for Jun Ho.

378
00:25:53,250 --> 00:25:55,889
After I took a break from university,

379
00:25:57,419 --> 00:25:58,990
I really didn't want to live.

380
00:26:00,359 --> 00:26:02,859
While you went on field trips and to lectures...

381
00:26:03,800 --> 00:26:05,159
and went on dates...

382
00:26:06,730 --> 00:26:07,830
In the mornings,

383
00:26:09,740 --> 00:26:11,769
I handed out flyers, cleaned offices during the day,

384
00:26:11,770 --> 00:26:12,969
and taught at night.

385
00:26:13,070 --> 00:26:14,139
It was really...

386
00:26:19,550 --> 00:26:22,679
I thought my life was a mess, and it drove me crazy.

387
00:26:29,090 --> 00:26:31,889
But then I realized I had stopped thinking like that.

388
00:26:34,590 --> 00:26:36,260
Not because life had become bearable.

389
00:26:38,500 --> 00:26:41,699
On some days, I was just in a good mood.

390
00:26:43,939 --> 00:26:45,469
Not because I made money.

391
00:26:47,869 --> 00:26:48,869
It was just...

392
00:26:50,939 --> 00:26:53,010
When my life felt dark and hopeless...

393
00:26:56,020 --> 00:26:58,149
I got through it because he was there.

394
00:27:05,830 --> 00:27:08,928
(You seem really tired today so I'm not waking you up.)

395
00:27:08,929 --> 00:27:11,859
(Hye Jin)

396
00:27:31,580 --> 00:27:33,889
(I'm so glad you grew to like books.)

397
00:27:37,320 --> 00:27:40,289
(I'm so glad you grew to like books.)

398
00:27:40,290 --> 00:27:41,858
(Admission Results)

399
00:27:41,859 --> 00:27:42,859
(Admission Results for Class of 2013)

400
00:27:48,929 --> 00:27:51,070
I got in.

401
00:27:54,340 --> 00:27:56,310
(Daechi Chase)

402
00:28:21,270 --> 00:28:23,499
(For the past 3 years, you worked hard.)

403
00:28:23,500 --> 00:28:27,469
(Thank you)

404
00:28:30,179 --> 00:28:33,080
(Hye Jin)

405
00:28:38,520 --> 00:28:41,649
Hey, pick up. Lee Jun Ho's calling.

406
00:28:42,619 --> 00:28:44,590
- Pick up. - I can't pick up.

407
00:28:52,359 --> 00:28:54,669
- Hello, Mr. Lee. - Oh, no.

408
00:28:55,199 --> 00:28:56,269
Are you crazy?

409
00:28:56,270 --> 00:28:58,399
- It's Cha So Young. - Give me that.

410
00:28:58,600 --> 00:29:00,070
- Yes. - You're insane.

411
00:29:00,439 --> 00:29:02,780
Yes, we met, didn't we?

412
00:29:14,119 --> 00:29:15,250
I'm...

413
00:29:16,990 --> 00:29:19,490
Give me the phone. Did you hang up?

414
00:29:19,830 --> 00:29:21,260
Are you crazy?

415
00:29:23,129 --> 00:29:25,659
- Hey. What now? - Come here.

416
00:29:26,600 --> 00:29:28,928
- As soon as he texted... - Don't.

417
00:29:28,929 --> 00:29:30,340
- Let's see. - Don't you dare.

418
00:29:30,540 --> 00:29:31,939
We're too drunk.

419
00:29:32,740 --> 00:29:34,909
- Hang on. - Don't.

420
00:29:35,270 --> 00:29:36,638
I need to go home now.

421
00:29:36,639 --> 00:29:37,810
I'm going home.

422
00:29:39,679 --> 00:29:41,310
What have we done?

423
00:29:41,550 --> 00:29:44,079
Give me that. I'll call for a driver.

424
00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:45,280
No. I'll...

425
00:29:45,719 --> 00:29:47,618
get my husband to pick me up.

426
00:29:47,619 --> 00:29:49,689
This isn't mine. Where's my phone?

427
00:29:51,320 --> 00:29:53,628
- Give it to me. - I'll call my old man...

428
00:29:53,629 --> 00:29:55,030
for a ride home.

429
00:29:55,530 --> 00:29:58,030
We'll get all sweet and cuddly in the car.

430
00:29:58,260 --> 00:30:00,368
I can't let you hire a driver to take you home.

431
00:30:00,369 --> 00:30:01,770
Have you gone crazy?

432
00:30:02,770 --> 00:30:04,770
Hello? Hi.

433
00:30:05,570 --> 00:30:08,740
I need you to come over.

434
00:30:08,840 --> 00:30:11,339
- Who are you talking to? - I'm at...

435
00:30:11,340 --> 00:30:13,908
- It better not be Jun Ho. - It's not.

436
00:30:13,909 --> 00:30:15,149
Jun Ho!

437
00:30:16,379 --> 00:30:18,218
- Right here... - Where's my phone?

438
00:30:18,219 --> 00:30:20,619
A fantasy couple might just form.

439
00:30:21,090 --> 00:30:22,319
It's a matter of...

440
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:24,218
- whether or not it'll happen. - Don't.

441
00:30:24,219 --> 00:30:25,888
It's an important moment.

442
00:30:25,889 --> 00:30:28,959
You should've downed the beer on your own.

443
00:30:30,260 --> 00:30:31,260
Okay.

444
00:30:32,230 --> 00:30:33,570
I still have a table.

445
00:30:34,530 --> 00:30:36,000
Okay, fine.

446
00:30:36,169 --> 00:30:37,869
Yes, okay.

447
00:30:38,169 --> 00:30:40,340
I got it, okay. Bye.

448
00:30:48,510 --> 00:30:49,649
Sir?

449
00:30:50,980 --> 00:30:51,980
Sir?

450
00:30:53,250 --> 00:30:55,090
I'm sorry, but it's closing time.

451
00:30:58,359 --> 00:31:01,429
Oh, right. Sorry.

452
00:31:03,699 --> 00:31:04,699
Gosh.

453
00:31:20,679 --> 00:31:23,049
Gosh, Mr. Lee. Hello.

454
00:31:23,050 --> 00:31:24,850
Gosh, hello.

455
00:31:25,449 --> 00:31:27,689
- So this is where we meet. - Right. Hello.

456
00:31:27,750 --> 00:31:29,020
You must be here for Hye Jin.

457
00:31:29,320 --> 00:31:31,060
- I am. - Shall we?

458
00:31:31,260 --> 00:31:32,260
Sure.

459
00:31:35,159 --> 00:31:36,530
What the...

460
00:31:44,369 --> 00:31:45,399
Gosh.

461
00:31:47,240 --> 00:31:48,240
What...

462
00:31:48,540 --> 00:31:49,580
Careful.

463
00:31:49,939 --> 00:31:51,209
Let go.

464
00:31:52,040 --> 00:31:53,050
Wait.

465
00:31:56,320 --> 00:31:57,520
- Gosh. - Careful.

466
00:31:58,520 --> 00:31:59,590
Watch your head.

467
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:11,600
- Get home safely. - Sure.

468
00:32:11,699 --> 00:32:13,168
I'll treat you to drinks sometime.

469
00:32:13,169 --> 00:32:15,368
I'd love that. I'll await your call.

470
00:32:15,369 --> 00:32:16,969
- Sure. - By the way,

471
00:32:17,770 --> 00:32:20,669
I'm not sure if I should be saying this, but...

472
00:32:40,689 --> 00:32:43,759
The expert shows off his skills.

473
00:32:43,760 --> 00:32:46,168
You should be proud of yourself...

474
00:32:46,169 --> 00:32:48,030
for drinking with a teacher who has a morning class.

475
00:32:48,100 --> 00:32:50,269
You'll be absolutely shocked...

476
00:32:50,270 --> 00:32:52,398
when you hear what I just did.

477
00:32:52,399 --> 00:32:55,839
As if. Don't try to take credit.

478
00:32:55,840 --> 00:32:58,709
They would've started dating soon even without you nudging.

479
00:32:58,810 --> 00:32:59,810
What?

480
00:33:00,080 --> 00:33:02,010
Did you know about them?

481
00:33:02,149 --> 00:33:03,449
Seriously.

482
00:33:04,179 --> 00:33:05,250
How?

483
00:33:05,879 --> 00:33:08,850
I knew the day Hye Jin brought him to the bar.

484
00:33:09,250 --> 00:33:10,689
I see.

485
00:33:11,260 --> 00:33:14,189
Seo Hye Jin is such an idiot.

486
00:33:14,459 --> 00:33:16,329
Only she doesn't know...

487
00:33:16,330 --> 00:33:18,030
what everyone else can see.

488
00:33:18,560 --> 00:33:19,770
People tend to be blind when it comes to themselves.

489
00:33:21,330 --> 00:33:25,369
Who knew probation existed when it comes to love?

490
00:33:25,639 --> 00:33:27,139
That sounds like lyrics from a famous song.

491
00:33:27,869 --> 00:33:31,438
Who knew probation existed when it comes to love?

492
00:33:31,439 --> 00:33:33,079
I'd love them...

493
00:33:33,080 --> 00:33:35,580
to enjoy the most passionate romance.

494
00:33:35,810 --> 00:33:37,580
One that's bone-crushing.

495
00:34:00,909 --> 00:34:02,169
I can...

496
00:34:02,270 --> 00:34:03,909
Watch your step.

497
00:34:04,409 --> 00:34:07,179
Gosh. Seriously.

498
00:34:07,679 --> 00:34:08,780
Goodness.

499
00:34:22,330 --> 00:34:23,400
Ms. Seo.

500
00:34:24,659 --> 00:34:26,799
- Gosh. - You'll be locked out at this rate.

501
00:34:27,900 --> 00:34:29,940
That'd be bad.

502
00:34:30,199 --> 00:34:31,399
Get it for me.

503
00:34:31,400 --> 00:34:34,139
- It's 04... - Quiet!

504
00:34:35,839 --> 00:34:37,080
What if someone hears you?

505
00:34:38,610 --> 00:34:39,880
Of course.

506
00:34:41,009 --> 00:34:42,049
Come close.

507
00:34:42,580 --> 00:34:44,449
- What? - Come.

508
00:34:45,279 --> 00:34:46,290
What?

509
00:34:46,489 --> 00:34:47,520
It's...

510
00:35:05,540 --> 00:35:07,009
I'm so tired.

511
00:35:09,239 --> 00:35:10,540
- Open it. - Sure.

512
00:35:13,279 --> 00:35:15,049
Can I leave after seeing you go to sleep?

513
00:35:18,920 --> 00:35:19,920
Could you?

514
00:35:26,929 --> 00:35:27,929
Come in.

515
00:36:05,529 --> 00:36:06,730
Could you see...

516
00:36:07,929 --> 00:36:09,100
all my lies?

517
00:36:15,869 --> 00:36:18,509
That you shouldn't waste your time chasing your first love.

518
00:36:20,110 --> 00:36:21,980
I also said I wasn't interested.

519
00:36:25,219 --> 00:36:26,319
What else was there?

520
00:36:28,089 --> 00:36:30,560
You said there were no magical moments in life,

521
00:36:32,319 --> 00:36:34,630
and that I was a nuisance to teach.

522
00:36:36,360 --> 00:36:37,600
Why didn't you forget about it?

523
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:41,029
I have forgotten it all.

524
00:36:42,699 --> 00:36:43,699
Jun Ho.

525
00:36:52,310 --> 00:36:53,549
My head hurts.

526
00:38:46,489 --> 00:38:47,589
I'm proud of you, Jun Ho.

527
00:38:49,290 --> 00:38:52,600
It turns out you're quite the gentleman.

528
00:38:54,730 --> 00:38:57,170
Right. Good job.

529
00:38:58,670 --> 00:38:59,810
You did well.

530
00:39:19,290 --> 00:39:21,330
Gosh. My head.

531
00:39:28,029 --> 00:39:30,569
Seo Hye Jin, you must be proud.

532
00:39:33,409 --> 00:39:34,969
Did you forget you had classes all day today?

533
00:39:56,230 --> 00:39:57,259
My head...

534
00:40:19,319 --> 00:40:20,319
Gosh.

535
00:40:21,319 --> 00:40:22,319
Right.

536
00:40:26,989 --> 00:40:29,560
I couldn't go rummaging through your things,

537
00:40:30,130 --> 00:40:31,360
so I got you soup and medicine.

538
00:40:36,969 --> 00:40:38,699
Don't tell me you don't remember.

539
00:40:40,610 --> 00:40:41,909
I'll go wash up.

540
00:41:27,119 --> 00:41:28,150
Darn.

541
00:41:29,889 --> 00:41:30,960
Ms. Seo?

542
00:41:40,730 --> 00:41:41,730
Are you all right?

543
00:42:12,460 --> 00:42:13,500
Sorry.

544
00:42:14,630 --> 00:42:15,729
Last night, I...

545
00:42:15,730 --> 00:42:17,000
I have a few announcements.

546
00:42:18,270 --> 00:42:19,270
Go ahead.

547
00:42:19,969 --> 00:42:22,909
First of all, do you think you can stomach anything?

548
00:42:24,909 --> 00:42:26,540
Even the water makes me queasy.

549
00:42:28,310 --> 00:42:29,409
Then,

550
00:42:29,850 --> 00:42:32,350
I'll cover the first class of the morning and afternoon.

551
00:42:32,779 --> 00:42:34,888
Don't be ridiculous. Never have I...

552
00:42:34,889 --> 00:42:37,389
An IV drip and some sleep will cure the hangover.

553
00:42:37,860 --> 00:42:39,020
I'll make a good excuse at the academy.

554
00:42:40,759 --> 00:42:43,190
No, those classes are mine, and I'll teach them.

555
00:42:45,560 --> 00:42:47,699
Then I'll tell Ms. Choi...

556
00:42:47,869 --> 00:42:49,299
that we were together last night.

557
00:42:50,170 --> 00:42:51,939
But once Ms. Choi knows,

558
00:42:51,940 --> 00:42:53,469
the whole world will get wind of it.

559
00:42:57,279 --> 00:42:58,980
I found a clinic that opens on Sundays.

560
00:42:59,909 --> 00:43:00,909
Got it?

561
00:43:04,480 --> 00:43:05,819
What's the next announcement?

562
00:43:07,319 --> 00:43:08,850
We have someplace to go after class today.

563
00:43:09,350 --> 00:43:10,420
Where?

564
00:43:10,889 --> 00:43:13,290
We should go on a date to commemorate this day.

565
00:43:16,730 --> 00:43:19,560
A date?

566
00:43:22,630 --> 00:43:23,639
For now,

567
00:43:26,369 --> 00:43:28,110
I'll let you know where my class material is.

568
00:43:28,610 --> 00:43:30,540
My laptop is on my desk at the academy.

569
00:43:30,679 --> 00:43:31,779
Wait.

570
00:43:33,179 --> 00:43:34,179
Just a second.

571
00:43:37,980 --> 00:43:40,089
I have one more announcement which is the most important one.

572
00:43:41,049 --> 00:43:42,089
What is it?

573
00:43:48,790 --> 00:43:49,929
My patience...

574
00:43:52,199 --> 00:43:53,630
has gone completely.

575
00:43:55,029 --> 00:43:56,069
What?

576
00:43:59,940 --> 00:44:00,940
Don't turn away.

579

Morning.

580
00:45:14,310 --> 00:45:15,350
Good morning.

581
00:45:15,850 --> 00:45:16,880
Hi.

582
00:45:23,690 --> 00:45:24,690
All right.

Ms. Nam.

584
00:45:35,170 --> 00:45:37,539
When one teacher has to cover...

585
00:45:37,540 --> 00:45:39,139
for another teacher,

586
00:45:39,400 --> 00:45:41,270
is a written notice mandatory?

587
00:45:41,670 --> 00:45:43,040
Or do I just tell the vice-director?

588
00:45:45,310 --> 00:45:47,709
Ms. Seo is feeling under the weather,

589
00:45:47,710 --> 00:45:50,779
so I'll be covering her first class.

590
00:45:53,080 --> 00:45:56,449
How is Ms. Seo being unwell a delight to you?

591
00:45:57,360 --> 00:45:58,420
Does it seem that way?

592
00:46:00,290 --> 00:46:01,389
I'll cover for her.

593
00:46:01,960 --> 00:46:03,290
No, I'll do it.

594
00:46:08,130 --> 00:46:09,170
We need to talk.

595
00:46:16,810 --> 00:46:19,080
Is Ms. Seo not able to notify the boss herself?

596
00:46:19,909 --> 00:46:20,909
I'm afraid so.

597
00:46:21,009 --> 00:46:23,750
She's probably sleeping while getting some fluids in.

598
00:46:24,179 --> 00:46:25,480
I see.

599
00:46:27,920 --> 00:46:29,048
I'll notify the boss.

600
00:46:29,049 --> 00:46:30,389
No, I'll do it.

601
00:46:31,989 --> 00:46:33,759
How did you know she was sick?

602
00:46:35,560 --> 00:46:37,560
Saying that I knew about it first...

603
00:46:38,029 --> 00:46:40,159
seems to be the key to world peace.

604
00:46:43,569 --> 00:46:44,600
Of course.

605
00:46:45,239 --> 00:46:46,439
I'll cover her class as well.

606
00:46:46,440 --> 00:46:48,839
That I'm fine with. I can do it.

607
00:46:51,009 --> 00:46:52,980
Sure. Do that, then.

608
00:46:53,080 --> 00:46:54,080
Right.

609
00:46:59,549 --> 00:47:00,790
Gosh.

610
00:47:05,389 --> 00:47:07,429
Isn't it better to just be with her?

611
00:47:14,199 --> 00:47:15,799
How could I ever repay you?

612
00:47:16,330 --> 00:47:17,440
You don't have to.

613
00:47:18,339 --> 00:47:19,839
I already received something in advance.

614
00:47:20,739 --> 00:47:22,509
- What? - The tablet PC.

615
00:47:23,069 --> 00:47:24,339
Ms. Seo will know.

616
00:47:24,980 --> 00:47:26,779
What on earth...

617
00:47:27,009 --> 00:47:28,210
What are you doing over there?

618
00:47:30,049 --> 00:47:31,049
It's nothing.

619
00:47:38,219 --> 00:47:39,420
- Hi. - Hey.

620
00:47:40,060 --> 00:47:42,029
Why were the two of you in there?

621
00:47:42,989 --> 00:47:44,000
- That... - Well...

622
00:47:44,460 --> 00:47:46,259
Ms. Seo is unwell,

623
00:47:46,730 --> 00:47:48,100
so we were discussing her class.

624
00:47:48,670 --> 00:47:49,699
Is Hye Jin sick?

625
00:47:50,670 --> 00:47:52,639
Apparently, she has a terrible cold.

626
00:47:54,339 --> 00:47:56,540
I see. Got it.

628
00:47:59,110 --> 00:48:00,210
Ms. Seo?

629
00:48:02,310 --> 00:48:04,880
Maintaining one's health speaks to her capacity as well.

630
00:48:08,319 --> 00:48:10,860
Are you sure you can cover her classes all day?

631
00:48:12,389 --> 00:48:13,389
Of course.

632
00:48:14,560 --> 00:48:15,960
Tell her to take the whole day off.

633
00:48:16,190 --> 00:48:18,400
She should fully recover to be ready for special lectures before finals.

634
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:20,060
Sure thing.

635
00:48:22,429 --> 00:48:23,429

you must be getting along with Ms. Seo.

637
00:48:28,339 --> 00:48:30,440
I don't have anyone I'm especially close to.

638
00:48:33,679 --> 00:48:36,448
Don't teach halfheartedly because you're covering for someone.

639
00:48:36,449 --> 00:48:38,080
That's only reserved for amateurs.

640

650

since I'll be able to teach today.

651
00:49:31,839 --> 00:49:33,469

I see.

654
00:49:37,640 --> 00:49:39,779
Things must be different here compared to where you used to teach.

655
00:49:43,750 --> 00:49:44,949
What I meant was...

656
00:49:45,420 --> 00:49:47,190
I wasn't implying anything.

657
00:49:48,449 --> 00:49:50,860
It's just that I've been here longer than you.

658

If anything like this happens,

659
00:49:54,029 --> 00:49:56,630

were Mr. Lee and me,

665

00:54:47,279 --> 00:54:49,448
I was fooled by your title. And I realized too late...

735
00:54:49,449 --> 00:54:50,719
that the title had stopped me.

736
00:54:51,819 --> 00:54:52,819
The whole thing was so not fair.

737
00:54:56,389 --> 00:54:58,560
Gosh, I'm glad it's dark in here.

738
00:55:00,730 --> 00:55:04,069
When you say stuff like that, I don't know how to react.

739
00:55:05,540 --> 00:55:07,000
I don't want to look silly to you.

740
00:55:16,580 --> 00:55:17,580
Go ahead and talk.

741
00:55:20,279 --> 00:55:21,350
You know,

742
00:55:22,949 --> 00:55:25,520
I spent a lot of time with students.

743
00:55:26,360 --> 00:55:28,029
I'm well-versed in new slang words.

744
00:55:28,630 --> 00:55:31,460
But I'm actually clueless about the things...

745
00:55:32,060 --> 00:55:34,369
women around my age like to discuss.

746
00:55:35,199 --> 00:55:37,568
I have no idea what kind of things they like to watch, listen to,

747
00:55:37,569 --> 00:55:39,069
feel, or think about.

748
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:41,739
So whenever you say stuff like that,

749
00:55:42,369 --> 00:55:45,310
I keep trying to figure out the right facial expression to make.

750
00:55:47,210 --> 00:55:48,750
At times like this, thinking isn't required.

751
00:55:50,710 --> 00:55:51,920
You're right.

752
00:55:52,250 --> 00:55:53,350
I lived,

753
00:55:54,049 --> 00:55:56,089
acting like a grown-up for a long time.

754
00:55:56,920 --> 00:55:57,989
But...

755
00:55:58,960 --> 00:56:01,230
that act is only convincing in a classroom like this.

756
00:56:02,389 --> 00:56:04,960
In general, I am... How should I put it?

757
00:56:05,600 --> 00:56:07,000
I'm slow and awkward.

758
00:56:07,730 --> 00:56:08,869
Let me elaborate.

759
00:56:12,139 --> 00:56:14,469
I'll probably be awkward and mess things up occasionally.

760
00:56:17,639 --> 00:56:18,839
So be understanding.

761
00:56:20,580 --> 00:56:21,580
Sure.

762
00:56:51,909 --> 00:56:52,980
Don't tell anyone about us.

763
00:56:54,350 --> 00:56:55,350
Why?

764
00:56:55,350 --> 00:56:56,350
You saw what happened with the free lecture, right?

765
00:56:56,650 --> 00:56:58,678
A lot of people are watching us like hawks...

766
00:56:58,679 --> 00:57:00,020
and hoping that we would make a mistake.

767
00:57:02,449 --> 00:57:03,749
If people find out about us,

768
00:57:03,750 --> 00:57:05,460
I won't have a say in anything like scheduling and so on.

769
00:57:05,860 --> 00:57:07,289
Let's say they aren't happy with me.

770
00:57:07,290 --> 00:57:09,829
Then they'll start saying stuff like I lost my mind after seducing...

771
00:57:09,830 --> 00:57:10,830
a former student of mine.

772
00:57:11,060 --> 00:57:12,960
Tell them that your former student seduced you.

773
00:57:13,560 --> 00:57:15,868
You tend to bulldoze through things without being more careful.

774
00:57:15,869 --> 00:57:17,099
They will blame me for it.

775
00:57:17,100 --> 00:57:18,600
They'll say you're running wild because I'll back you.

776
00:57:19,469 --> 00:57:22,009
The problem is that this gossip will end up shaping our reputation.

777
00:57:22,270 --> 00:57:23,270
We can't let that happen. You know?

778
00:57:28,880 --> 00:57:31,380
Don't get out of the car. Just drive home with it.

779
00:57:33,319 --> 00:57:34,350
You want me to leave?

780
00:57:36,119 --> 00:57:38,859
But today was a big day. We had our first date.

781
00:57:38,860 --> 00:57:40,489
You're not going to invite me upstairs for tea?

782
00:57:40,860 --> 00:57:42,429
Or you won't offer stuff like ramyeon?

783
00:57:43,659 --> 00:57:44,699
Hey.

784
00:57:45,360 --> 00:57:46,429
Gosh.

785
00:57:46,630 --> 00:57:48,770
- No. I can't just leave like this. - Wait. Stop.

786
00:57:57,739 --> 00:57:58,810
I need to study.

787
00:58:02,210 --> 00:58:03,210
Drive home safely.

788
00:58:04,319 --> 00:58:06,080
- Ms. Seo. - Yes.

789
00:58:10,049 --> 00:58:11,089
I need more of you.

790
00:58:36,080 --> 00:58:38,150
Gosh. I told you we should just make another trip.

791
00:58:39,819 --> 00:58:41,689
Hey. Can I go in with my shoes on?

792
00:58:41,690 --> 00:58:43,388
No. I finished getting the floor cleaned.

793
00:58:43,389 --> 00:58:45,420
- Keep going. - Don't push me.

794
00:58:46,719 --> 00:58:47,759
Darn it.

795
00:58:50,230 --> 00:58:51,299
Gosh.

796
00:58:52,060 --> 00:58:53,829
- Goodness. - Good grief. That was so heavy.

797
00:58:53,830 --> 00:58:54,900
Gosh.

798
00:58:57,029 --> 00:58:58,040
It's so cold.

799
00:58:58,739 --> 00:58:59,799
Where's water?

800
00:59:00,139 --> 00:59:01,440
Water? Check the fridge.

801
00:59:05,009 --> 00:59:06,009
What's this?

802
00:59:09,949 --> 00:59:10,949
All done.

803
00:59:10,950 --> 00:59:12,279
Gosh. That was so exhausting.

804
00:59:25,460 --> 00:59:28,369
Hey. You managed to move a lot of stuff in advance, though.

805
00:59:29,029 --> 00:59:30,500
I did it whenever I had time.

806
00:59:32,739 --> 00:59:34,040
Your dad doesn't need his car these days?

807
00:59:34,339 --> 00:59:36,869
It wasn't his. I moved them with Ms. Seo's car.

808
00:59:37,880 --> 00:59:38,940
Who?

809
00:59:39,679 --> 00:59:40,679
Seo Hye Jin.

810
00:59:40,980 --> 00:59:42,750
Ms. Seo lives nearby.

811
00:59:47,219 --> 00:59:48,250
What?

812
00:59:49,750 --> 00:59:51,659
What? Why are you staring at me like that?

813
00:59:52,759 --> 00:59:53,819
I thought you knew everything.

814
00:59:55,259 --> 00:59:57,830
But you had a crush on her years ago.

815
00:59:58,199 --> 00:59:59,630
Who cares about that?

816
01:00:00,259 --> 01:00:02,730
Well, it's what you're thinking.

817
01:00:03,969 --> 01:00:04,969
Wait.

818
01:00:05,869 --> 01:00:06,940
You're dating her?

819
01:00:11,310 --> 01:00:12,540
Gosh. Come on.

820
01:00:15,049 --> 01:00:17,710
Hey. I'm going to need a drink to listen to this story.

821
01:00:18,850 --> 01:00:19,850
Do you have a beer?

822
01:00:20,119 --> 01:00:21,389
I have a pile of them in the fridge.

823
01:00:21,549 --> 01:00:23,319
You can drink them all if you want.

824
01:00:24,420 --> 01:00:26,519
- What about you? - I must wash up and go to work.

825
01:00:26,520 --> 01:00:27,589
This is the high season for special lectures.

826
01:00:27,889 --> 01:00:29,258
Gosh, that jerk.

827
01:00:29,259 --> 01:00:30,988
I didn't have a single day off over a month now.

828
01:00:30,989 --> 01:00:32,299
Gosh. Seriously.

829
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:37,029
Where's the light switch?

830
01:00:40,139 --> 01:00:41,139
Darn it.

831
01:00:50,779 --> 01:00:53,350
- Hey. - You startled me. What?

832
01:00:53,920 --> 01:00:55,290
What do I call her when I see her?

833
01:00:55,889 --> 01:00:57,790
Ma'am? Ms. Seo?

834
01:00:59,360 --> 01:01:00,360
Or Hye Jin?

835
01:01:01,790 --> 01:01:03,429
Address her respectfully, you lunatic.

836
01:01:03,560 --> 01:01:04,860
"Hye Jin?" How dare you?

837
01:01:07,060 --> 01:01:08,130
I'll get going first.

838
01:01:16,170 --> 01:01:17,509
Hello, Ms. Seo.

839
01:01:18,009 --> 01:01:20,040
Gosh. Already?

840
01:01:20,380 --> 01:01:22,310
Now, it feels like the end of the semester, doesn't it?

841
01:01:22,380 --> 01:01:23,580
Yes, it does.

842
01:01:23,850 --> 01:01:25,480
The university entrance exam ended only two days ago.

843
01:01:26,020 --> 01:01:28,119
Go to the director's office. He wants to talk to you.

844
01:01:28,949 --> 01:01:31,118
I'll come right back. Let's decorate the tree together.

845
01:01:31,119 --> 01:01:32,719
I love decorating a Christmas tree.

846
01:01:32,920 --> 01:01:33,989
Sounds good.

847
01:01:35,759 --> 01:01:37,759
- Hello. - Hello.

848
01:01:40,060 --> 01:01:41,130
Hello.

849
01:01:41,929 --> 01:01:44,069
Gosh. I guess I'm getting a year older once again.

850
01:01:45,000 --> 01:01:46,670
Mr. Jang. Would you like to join me?

851
01:01:47,940 --> 01:01:50,170
- I'm a Buddhist. - I see.

852
01:01:52,980 --> 01:01:54,509
I can join you.

853
01:01:54,850 --> 01:01:56,049
Gosh, thank you.

854
01:02:03,389 --> 01:02:04,389
Come in.

855
01:02:06,219 --> 01:02:07,860
- I heard you wanted to see me. - Hey.

856
01:02:08,460 --> 01:02:11,630
Goodness. I barely got to see any of the teachers or team leaders...

857
01:02:11,929 --> 01:02:14,569
because of these last-minute makeup classes.

858
01:02:14,900 --> 01:02:17,129
I asked to see you, so we could catch up.

859
01:02:17,130 --> 01:02:18,199
Let's sit down.

860
01:02:25,139 --> 01:02:26,179
What?

861
01:02:28,509 --> 01:02:29,710
Do they look that weird?

862
01:02:29,850 --> 01:02:30,880
Why can't you look at my face?

863
01:02:32,549 --> 01:02:33,549
They don't look weird.

864
01:02:34,080 --> 01:02:35,190
Really? Then look at me.

865
01:02:36,250 --> 01:02:37,250
Look at me.

866
01:02:37,719 --> 01:02:39,659
- I'm good. - Gosh.

867
01:02:40,290 --> 01:02:43,130
My mother got my fortune read by a shaman or whatnot.

868
01:02:43,560 --> 01:02:44,560
The shaman said...

869
01:02:44,561 --> 01:02:46,698
I needed to get my eyebrows done to make this academy successful...

870
01:02:46,699 --> 01:02:49,100
and be able to find a woman I could marry. That's what she said.

871
01:02:50,400 --> 01:02:51,969
I hope it works.

872
01:02:53,699 --> 01:02:55,269
I hear the shaman is pretty gifted. Should I introduce her to you?

873
01:02:55,270 --> 01:02:56,540
Gosh, no. I'm good.

874
01:02:56,940 --> 01:02:57,980
Goodness.

875
01:02:59,810 --> 01:03:01,709
Aren't you curious to see...

876
01:03:01,710 --> 01:03:04,650
if one of your students will have the highest grades again?

877
01:03:06,619 --> 01:03:08,849
I think you're more curious than me.

878
01:03:08,850 --> 01:03:09,889
Goodness.

879
01:03:10,920 --> 01:03:12,360
Aren't you curious?

880
01:03:13,020 --> 01:03:15,560
I had always been curious before.

881
01:03:16,630 --> 01:03:18,830
- But not this year. - Why not?

882
01:03:20,029 --> 01:03:21,429
All of my students will do well.

883
01:03:22,270 --> 01:03:24,069
I've done everything I could.

884
01:03:28,040 --> 01:03:30,368
Both Chanyoung High and Heewon High will hold their Korean exams...

885
01:03:30,369 --> 01:03:31,540
on the same day, of all days.

886
01:03:32,380 --> 01:03:34,139
Our students will get their grades all at once.

887
01:03:39,549 --> 01:03:40,549
Right.

888
01:03:45,319 --> 01:03:46,360
How was it?

889
01:03:46,719 --> 01:03:47,758
Did you like the class?

890
01:03:47,759 --> 01:03:48,830
- Yes. - Yes.

891
01:03:48,989 --> 01:03:51,059
Great. Lastly,

892
01:03:51,060 --> 01:03:52,258
I will nag you one last time...

893
01:03:52,259 --> 01:03:53,929
even though I've already done it 100 times before I let you go. Okay?

894
01:03:54,429 --> 01:03:55,499
As for the essay questions...

895
01:03:55,500 --> 01:03:56,798
and especially the short-answer questions,

896
01:03:56,799 --> 01:03:58,839
they aren't important just because they're worth a lot of points.

897
01:03:59,339 --> 01:04:01,968
The ability to organize your thoughts...

898
01:04:01,969 --> 01:04:03,669
and express your knowledge clearly while following the rules...

899
01:04:03,670 --> 01:04:05,739
will be a great asset for the rest of your lives.

900
01:04:06,810 --> 01:04:09,678
I'm not asking you to be some great writers like the poet...

901
01:04:09,679 --> 01:04:11,449
we learned about today, Paek Sok,

902
01:04:11,920 --> 01:04:14,549
Novelist Kim Chun Su, or Novelist Kim Ae Ran. Okay?

903
01:04:15,020 --> 01:04:17,189
Think of it as learning the basic knowledge...

904
01:04:17,190 --> 01:04:18,318
one must naturally have...

905
01:04:18,319 --> 01:04:19,790
after receiving a proper high school education.

906
01:04:19,960 --> 01:04:22,190
Make sure to review the materials to the end.

907
01:04:22,290 --> 01:04:23,759
- Understood? - Yes.

908
01:04:24,259 --> 01:04:25,299
Good job, everyone.

909
01:04:25,860 --> 01:04:27,129
As long as you kept up with my class,

910
01:04:27,130 --> 01:04:29,270
you can be confidently bold when taking your exam tomorrow.

911
01:04:30,199 --> 01:04:31,230
Because I feel confident.

912
01:04:32,299 --> 01:04:33,339
It's time for you to shine now.

913
01:04:37,610 --> 01:04:38,610
Class dismissed.

914
01:04:39,239 --> 01:04:40,409
- Thank you. - Thank you.

915
01:04:44,279 --> 01:04:47,150
Good job.

916
01:04:47,719 --> 01:04:49,719
Bye. Get home safely.

917
01:04:49,790 --> 01:04:51,119
- Don't make mistakes. - Good job.

918
01:04:52,219 --> 01:04:53,219
- Wait. - Good job.

919
01:04:53,220 --> 01:04:54,888
- Good job. - You got this.

920
01:04:54,889 --> 01:04:56,230
Well done.

921
01:04:59,600 --> 01:05:01,900
- Good job. - Well done, Si Woo.

922
01:05:04,170 --> 01:05:05,239
By the way,

923
01:05:06,569 --> 01:05:08,610
is there a class next week?

924
01:05:08,940 --> 01:05:09,969
Why do you ask?

925
01:05:11,839 --> 01:05:14,980
Well, could you hold a special lecture on literature?

926
01:05:15,350 --> 01:05:16,509
Just like the free lecture.

927
01:05:17,610 --> 01:05:20,179
Hey, if we tell the other students that we'll start the class...

928
01:05:20,750 --> 01:05:22,420
right after the exam, they'll badmouth us.

929
01:05:23,150 --> 01:05:24,219
I think it will be fun.

930
01:05:25,489 --> 01:05:27,259
If you think it will be fun, we ought to do it.

931
01:05:30,190 --> 01:05:31,190
Okay.

932
01:05:32,429 --> 01:05:33,500
- Thank you. - Sure.

933
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:35,528
- Good work. - Get home safely.

934
01:05:35,529 --> 01:05:37,330
- Good luck. - Bye.

935
01:05:43,739 --> 01:05:44,739
Gosh.

936
01:05:45,739 --> 01:05:46,739
Goodness.

937
01:05:52,779 --> 01:05:54,319
Well done, Mr. Lee.

938
01:05:54,679 --> 01:05:56,389
Thank you for your help, Ms. Seo.

939
01:06:00,560 --> 01:06:01,730
It's finally over.

940
01:06:02,690 --> 01:06:03,690
Good job.

941
01:06:05,299 --> 01:06:06,299
We should leave quickly...

942
01:06:06,300 --> 01:06:07,529
before anyone stops us now that the lecture is over.

943
01:06:07,659 --> 01:06:08,969
Wait for me at the subway station.

944
01:06:09,230 --> 01:06:10,830
Someone might see us at the parking lot.

945
01:07:07,190 --> 01:07:08,889
We should have watched a late-night movie like I suggested.

946
01:07:09,759 --> 01:07:11,459
Our students have an exam tomorrow.

947
01:07:11,460 --> 01:07:12,929
Some students call us.

948
01:07:14,360 --> 01:07:15,429
Let's take a rain check for the movie.

949
01:07:16,830 --> 01:07:17,869
Fine.

950
01:07:26,139 --> 01:07:27,239
Bye.

951
01:07:35,250 --> 01:07:36,250
Bye.

952
01:07:47,830 --> 01:07:50,230
Oh, right. I ran out of milk at home.

953
01:07:50,429 --> 01:07:52,639
- I totally forgot. - I see.

954
01:08:13,759 --> 01:08:14,929
- Would you like a bag? - Yes.

955
01:08:15,029 --> 01:08:16,360
The bag costs ten cents.

956
01:08:26,940 --> 01:08:28,370
Do you need a receipt?

957
01:08:29,469 --> 01:08:30,539
Ma'am.

958
01:08:32,339 --> 01:08:34,039
- Yes. I see. - I packed it up for you.

959
01:08:41,450 --> 01:08:42,450
You should go.

960
01:08:43,549 --> 01:08:44,589
I'll walk you home.

961
01:08:44,959 --> 01:08:46,690
My house is literally only a few steps away.

962
01:09:38,879 --> 01:09:40,179
You should change the passcode of your house.

963
01:09:42,850 --> 01:09:43,850
Well,

964
01:09:46,679 --> 01:09:48,248
I don't think I should know the passcode.

965
01:09:48,249 --> 01:09:49,389
Oh, that. I already did.

966
01:09:51,020 --> 01:09:52,020
I see.

967
01:09:54,889 --> 01:09:55,889
Right.

968
01:09:59,459 --> 01:10:00,459
You should get inside.

969
01:10:04,230 --> 01:10:05,240
Come closer.

970
01:10:05,499 --> 01:10:07,039
What?

971
01:10:09,669 --> 01:10:10,709
That was a lie.

972
01:10:12,410 --> 01:10:14,009
Then you should change it as soon as...

973
01:10:15,379 --> 01:10:17,150
Actually, I had milk at home.

974
01:10:20,919 --> 01:10:22,190
That was pretty smooth. Wasn't it?

975
01:10:23,789 --> 01:10:24,789
Let's go upstairs.

976
01:10:30,259 --> 01:10:31,289
Let's go up.

977
01:10:56,549 --> 01:11:00,259
(The Midnight Romance in Hagwon)

978
01:11:01,219 --> 01:11:02,259
See you at work.

979
01:11:05,900 --> 01:11:07,660
But why are you coming up from here?

980
01:11:07,860 --> 01:11:09,799
Come up later. Take the elevator when you come up.

981
01:11:10,370 --> 01:11:12,298
I'm asking why someone from an academy wants to talk to me.

982
01:11:12,299 --> 01:11:14,169
He wasn't even interested in reading the contract.

983
01:11:14,270 --> 01:11:16,810
The evaluations are done not by words, but with numbers.

984
01:11:17,070 --> 01:11:18,939
By the way, yesterday, that punk...

985
01:11:18,940 --> 01:11:20,639
Let's call it even with the passcode to your house.

986
01:11:21,679 --> 01:11:23,350
- Hello, Ms. Seo. - Hey.

987
01:11:23,450 --> 01:11:25,549
I was wondering if I would lose the title of your favorite student.

988
01:11:25,850 --> 01:11:26,850
Does it not matter now?

989
01:11:26,851 --> 01:11:28,079
Because I'm not your favorite student anymore,

990
01:11:28,490 --> 01:11:29,490
but your boyfriend.
