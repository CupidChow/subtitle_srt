 The Midnight Romance in Hagwon 

13
00:00:45,730 --> 00:00:46,900
 Episode 16 

14
00:00:46,900 --> 00:00:48,810
Did she say Seo Hye Jin...

15
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:53,910
isn't just screwed but totally screwed?

16
00:00:53,910 --> 00:00:56,870
- Well— 
- Did she say this academy is

17
00:00:56,870 --> 00:01:01,660
totally, completely, entirely hopeless?

18
00:01:02,360 --> 00:01:03,780
Yes.

19
00:01:05,460 --> 00:01:09,260
So, she told everyone to escape for that reason.

20
00:01:13,930 --> 00:01:19,550
Doesn't it make you anxious to serve someone like her?

21
00:01:19,550 --> 00:01:23,510
It's not like I'd be serving her.

22
00:01:23,510 --> 00:01:26,640
Pros communicate through contracts.

23
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:34,020
Should I put the resignation letter in the director's office?

24
00:01:34,020 --> 00:01:37,310
I... I'll let him know.

25
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:44,680
Ms. Kim.

26
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:46,730
Ms. Kim.

27
00:01:46,730 --> 00:01:49,190
Have you heard from Assistant Director?

28
00:01:49,190 --> 00:01:50,690
I haven't.

29
00:01:50,690 --> 00:01:55,210
By the way, what files was she talking about?

30
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,800
 Resignation Letter 

31
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:16,980
Ms. Seo.

32
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:37,090


33
00:02:56,760 --> 00:02:58,520
Buy me a drink.

34
00:03:06,300 --> 00:03:08,230
Congratulations, Director.

35
00:03:08,230 --> 00:03:11,230
We sent 100 students to Seoul National University!

36
00:03:11,230 --> 00:03:12,710
- Congratulations!
 - Congratulations!

37
00:03:12,710 --> 00:03:15,370
He was on the wait list for the humanities. It's nothing to brag about.

38
00:03:15,370 --> 00:03:16,540
It's Park Yo Sep, right?

39
00:03:16,540 --> 00:03:20,670
Yes. Yo Sep's mother gave you this. It's rice cakes.

40
00:03:20,670 --> 00:03:22,390
Please enjoy them.

41
00:03:22,390 --> 00:03:24,420
- Thank you.
 - Thank you.

42
00:03:24,420 --> 00:03:26,210
Don't wait for more waitlist acceptances.

43
00:03:26,210 --> 00:03:28,600
Order the acceptee banner.

44
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:30,080
Got it.

45
00:04:04,410 --> 00:04:08,960
Kim Chae Yun hit a home run with words.

46
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:11,920
The pitcher was Seo Hye Jin, even.

47
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:14,500
Did you get a hold of Lee Myeong Jun?

48
00:04:15,130 --> 00:04:18,850
Let them have him. He's just a fly to me.

49
00:04:20,080 --> 00:04:22,470
A ton of students have already left...

50
00:04:22,470 --> 00:04:26,390
and Kim Hyeon Tak can't match the salary.

51
00:04:27,190 --> 00:04:31,800
Seo Hye Jin basically admitted that she can't get back up.

52
00:04:33,230 --> 00:04:36,980
But why, of all people, Min Ji...

53
00:04:36,980 --> 00:04:39,680
Do you know how to play chess?

54
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:42,900
Yes, I just know the rules.

55
00:04:42,900 --> 00:04:45,310
The lowest rank is called a "pawn."

56
00:04:45,310 --> 00:04:49,040
It gets promoted if it enters the enemy's camp all the way.

57
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:51,540
Normally, to a queen.

58
00:04:51,540 --> 00:04:56,330
The moment the pawn reaches that point, he becomes a game changer.

59
00:04:57,990 --> 00:05:01,150
Choi Hyeong Seon moved out of the apartment.

60
00:05:01,150 --> 00:05:02,430
That's—

61
00:05:02,430 --> 00:05:05,400
Yes, she used to give private lessons illegally at night there.

62
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:06,540
Yes.

63
00:05:06,540 --> 00:05:10,560
She must've thought I'd use that against her. She moved out immediately.

64
00:05:12,050 --> 00:05:15,160
To see how Choi Hyeong Seon behaves

65
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:19,740
and let the stupid Lee Jun Ho know whom he messed with,

66
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:22,490
let's get things moving.

67
00:05:22,490 --> 00:05:25,270
Sweeten the deal for me.

68
00:05:26,740 --> 00:05:32,120
Create a situation where

69
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:34,990
I have to stay with the academy.

70
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:39,220
So that even Wu Seung Hui could accept it.

71
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:45,110
Are you that important to Wu Seung Hui?

72
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:48,590
You know, I...

73
00:05:53,990 --> 00:05:59,300
If I said, "I'll replace Seo Hye Jin," with my own mouth,

74
00:05:59,300 --> 00:06:03,370
would anyone take it seriously?

75
00:06:05,580 --> 00:06:07,630
I'll work on it.

76
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:10,970
Drink.

77
00:06:11,780 --> 00:06:17,130
Make it clear to Kim Hyeon Tak.

78
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:24,270
Drink more.

79
00:06:24,930 --> 00:06:32,280
I'm basically saving the country by doing this.

80
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:35,440
Why did you bring kimchi at this hour?

81
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:38,000
Kimchi was just an excuse.

82
00:06:38,930 --> 00:06:43,460
I came to see how you were doing.

83
00:06:43,460 --> 00:06:45,970
I have nothing to give you.

84
00:06:45,970 --> 00:06:47,520
Just give me some water.

85
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:49,900
I'll leave soon.

86
00:06:49,900 --> 00:06:51,730
Okay.

87
00:06:54,760 --> 00:06:56,600
Were you studying?

88
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:58,760
Just going through the motions.

89
00:07:03,010 --> 00:07:05,900
I won't act ignorant.

90
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:11,050
I heard from my husband.

91
00:07:11,850 --> 00:07:15,780
He said you're in the worst situation right now.

92
00:07:15,780 --> 00:07:19,010
Lee Jun Ho is crawling in front of me?

93
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:24,500
Would I believe that?

94
00:07:31,530 --> 00:07:36,610
Wu Seung Hui betrayed you first, right?

95
00:07:36,610 --> 00:07:38,370
Using Ms. Seo's files.

96
00:07:38,370 --> 00:07:42,440
Hey, how could you think that?

97
00:07:43,370 --> 00:07:48,630
It's a serious decision I made myself.

98
00:07:48,630 --> 00:07:52,320
Can't you just tell me?

99
00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:53,900
What happened with Wu Seung Hui?

100
00:07:53,900 --> 00:07:56,470
Just keep asking me.

101
00:07:56,470 --> 00:07:58,300
See if I answer.

102
00:08:00,850 --> 00:08:02,320
Okay.

103
00:08:04,830 --> 00:08:07,410
My whole body hurts.

104
00:08:07,410 --> 00:08:09,370
I feel like I was beaten up.

105
00:08:09,370 --> 00:08:11,950
Of course, you do.

106
00:08:11,950 --> 00:08:15,640
It basically means your whole life was trashed.

107
00:08:16,450 --> 00:08:18,590
That's true, but...

108
00:08:20,150 --> 00:08:22,720
it hurts even more because of Jun Ho.

109
00:08:24,670 --> 00:08:28,720
I think Jun Ho matured all at once.

110
00:08:31,190 --> 00:08:33,910
That's a good thing.

111
00:08:34,610 --> 00:08:40,400
It'd be worse if he wanted to play with you like a child.

112
00:08:42,680 --> 00:08:46,710
So? Is he no longer fun?

113
00:08:47,610 --> 00:08:53,290
Did you prefer it when he stepped all over your life?

114
00:08:53,290 --> 00:08:55,440
It was nice.

115
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:58,040
I experienced things I never had before

116
00:08:58,040 --> 00:09:00,760
and I was loved more than I deserved.

117
00:09:02,410 --> 00:09:04,640
But now...

118
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:06,420
What about now?

119
00:09:08,100 --> 00:09:10,040
I'm just worried.

120
00:09:11,810 --> 00:09:14,300
What are you worried about?

121
00:09:14,300 --> 00:09:18,120
He's still young and smart.

122
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:20,680
Not Jun Ho, but me.

123
00:09:23,220 --> 00:09:28,980
At first, I was so scared to let him in my life,

124
00:09:30,210 --> 00:09:32,100
but now...

125
00:09:34,260 --> 00:09:37,350
I can't imagine being without him.

126
00:09:40,660 --> 00:09:42,940
Aren't I so silly?

127
00:09:47,970 --> 00:09:51,340
Whether it's defamation or insult,

128
00:09:51,340 --> 00:09:54,320
tell me whomever you want to sue.

129
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:56,920
Let me make a fortune, too.

130
00:09:56,920 --> 00:09:59,070
Thank you for the kimchi.

131
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:02,920
Cheer up. I'll go.

132
00:10:02,920 --> 00:10:04,900
Okay, bye.

133
00:10:53,700 --> 00:10:55,620
Why are you outside?

134
00:10:55,620 --> 00:10:58,390
Are you telepathic or something?

135
00:10:58,390 --> 00:11:00,310
What's going on?

136
00:11:00,310 --> 00:11:02,410
Were you drinking all this time?

137
00:11:04,260 --> 00:11:07,350
Lee Myeong Jun is such a lush.

138
00:11:07,350 --> 00:11:09,930
I thought I was dying.

139
00:11:09,930 --> 00:11:13,910
You know how many people you fought today, right?

140
00:11:13,910 --> 00:11:17,180
- Was I supposed to keep count?
 - Aren't you tired?

141
00:11:17,180 --> 00:11:19,190
I'm tired.

142
00:11:19,190 --> 00:11:21,100
You should've just gone home then.

143
00:11:21,100 --> 00:11:23,250
I missed you.

144
00:11:25,770 --> 00:11:28,100
I called you, but you didn't answer.

145
00:11:29,510 --> 00:11:31,380
I left the phone inside.

146
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:34,150
That's why I came.

147
00:11:35,710 --> 00:11:38,760
I was going to leave if the lights were off.

148
00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:41,460
But I wanted to see you if they were on.

149
00:11:46,550 --> 00:11:49,400
I missed you so, so much.

150
00:11:55,450 --> 00:11:58,330
You look totally smitten with me.

151
00:12:08,540 --> 00:12:11,090
I want to stay a bit longer,

152
00:12:13,210 --> 00:12:16,050
but you're dressed too lightly.

153
00:12:16,730 --> 00:12:18,620
I'm okay.

154
00:12:20,340 --> 00:12:22,160
I'm okay, too.

155
00:12:24,580 --> 00:12:26,440
I'll go.

156
00:12:27,510 --> 00:12:29,000
Okay.

157
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,940
Sleep tight.

158
00:12:30,940 --> 00:12:33,920
Unload all of your worries with me.

159
00:12:35,160 --> 00:12:37,160
You can do that, right?

160
00:12:38,580 --> 00:12:40,040
Yes.

161
00:12:49,020 --> 00:12:50,880
Hold on.

162
00:12:56,840 --> 00:12:59,110
I want you to put me to bed.

163
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:02,400
Or you can stay.

164
00:13:49,790 --> 00:13:52,050
 Resignation Letter 

165
00:13:54,550 --> 00:13:56,740
I don't know what to say.

166
00:13:57,980 --> 00:14:00,480
Team Leader Min Hui Ju of the social studies department

167
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:04,390
and Team Leader Jang Il Do of the English department requested a one-on-one, too.

168
00:14:04,390 --> 00:14:08,040
Are they trying to give me something like this?

169
00:14:14,620 --> 00:14:18,860
By the way, why is Lee Myeong Jun quiet?

170
00:14:18,860 --> 00:14:22,260
I thought he'd be the first one to quit.

171
00:14:25,660 --> 00:14:27,810
Enjoy.

172
00:14:29,260 --> 00:14:31,450
Let's talk while eating.

173
00:14:32,090 --> 00:14:36,170
By the way, can I take a photo?

174
00:14:36,970 --> 00:14:39,620
Sure, go ahead.

175
00:15:06,130 --> 00:15:08,510
Thank you for the meal.

176
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:12,720
Do you have a lot of followers?

177
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:14,660
Well, no.

178
00:15:14,660 --> 00:15:21,510
I don't have many friends since I was away from school for a long time and I'm too busy at the academy.

179
00:15:21,510 --> 00:15:23,520
Well...

180
00:15:23,520 --> 00:15:26,120
I've been hearing about what's going on.

181
00:15:26,120 --> 00:15:28,270
You have no reason to be busy, do you?

182
00:15:28,270 --> 00:15:29,660
Pardon?

183
00:15:29,660 --> 00:15:33,730
I thought Team Leader Seo had been losing students.

184
00:15:35,140 --> 00:15:39,250
I think she's continuing to do research.

185
00:15:39,250 --> 00:15:41,350
You must feel guilty.

186
00:15:41,350 --> 00:15:46,160
Team Leader Seo pays you out of pocket, right?

187
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:49,830
 She can smell that stale stench instinctively. 

188
00:15:49,830 --> 00:15:54,300
But she hasn't said anything yet.

189
00:15:55,700 --> 00:15:59,780
She's acting cool, isn't she?

190
00:15:59,780 --> 00:16:01,780
She doesn't want you to worry.

191
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:09,620
It's okay.

192
00:16:10,350 --> 00:16:13,570
I'm trying to be helpful.

193
00:16:16,850 --> 00:16:20,270
There's a part-time position where you get

194
00:16:20,270 --> 00:16:25,620
paid monthly and get a scholarship as well.

195
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:34,000
Send the new address to the Special Class students.

196
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:37,470
Don't just message them. Give them the physical notes.

197
00:16:37,470 --> 00:16:38,620
Okay.

198
00:16:38,620 --> 00:16:41,570
Make sure no one goes to the apartment like an idiot.

199
00:16:41,570 --> 00:16:44,490
Tighten the security, too.

200
00:16:44,490 --> 00:16:45,980
Okay.

201
00:16:50,420 --> 00:16:52,770
You're trying to make money, anyway.

202
00:16:52,770 --> 00:16:55,310
I just want you to feel at ease.

203
00:16:55,310 --> 00:16:58,540
Why are you hesitating so much? You're hurting my feelings.

204
00:16:59,240 --> 00:17:02,570
It doesn't look like a normal TA position.

205
00:17:05,410 --> 00:17:07,770
You're smart.

206
00:17:07,770 --> 00:17:10,950
Are you curious what you'd be doing?

207
00:17:10,950 --> 00:17:12,400
Yes.

208
00:17:14,150 --> 00:17:19,560
Turn that thing off, then. I'll tell you.

209
00:17:19,560 --> 00:17:21,240
Pardon?

210
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:23,360
Stop recording.

211
00:17:46,390 --> 00:17:50,140
She innocently asked, "Can I take a photo?"

212
00:17:50,140 --> 00:17:52,890
But she was recording the whole time.

213
00:17:56,010 --> 00:17:59,430
I like her. She's so clever.

214
00:17:59,430 --> 00:18:02,490
She reminds me of the young Seo Hye Jin.

215
00:18:02,490 --> 00:18:04,860
She's very close to Seo Hye Jin.

216
00:18:04,860 --> 00:18:06,010
It might not work.

217
00:18:06,010 --> 00:18:09,370
Didn't you hear her saying she'd send a resume?

218
00:18:09,370 --> 00:18:16,790
Kids like her can smell a better deal and go after it instinctively.

219
00:18:17,390 --> 00:18:21,540
How could she say no to that much money?

220
00:18:22,220 --> 00:18:25,440
Don't worry, okay?

221
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,590
Hey, Ha Yul.

222
00:18:33,590 --> 00:18:35,180
Are you going to the academy?

223
00:18:35,180 --> 00:18:36,630
Yes.

224
00:18:36,630 --> 00:18:38,120
You, too?

225
00:18:38,120 --> 00:18:39,730
Korean?

226
00:18:40,910 --> 00:18:44,330
How are things there? Was it really the best choice?

227
00:18:44,330 --> 00:18:46,100
I'm not sure.

228
00:18:46,100 --> 00:18:48,770
This is my first time going there.

229
00:18:49,860 --> 00:18:51,560
I see.

230
00:18:53,370 --> 00:18:54,950
Well, Ms. Min Ji.

231
00:18:54,950 --> 00:18:56,260
Yes.

232
00:18:56,260 --> 00:19:00,940
I'm happy I ran into you. It's good to see you.

233
00:19:00,940 --> 00:19:04,380
Me, too. I'm happy to see you, too.

234
00:19:05,480 --> 00:19:12,130
By chance, could you relay a message to Ms. Seo?

235
00:19:12,130 --> 00:19:14,830
Is it something you can't say in person?

236
00:19:14,830 --> 00:19:20,390
I can't contact her because I feel too guilty.

237
00:19:20,390 --> 00:19:23,220
What is it? If you need to return the textbooks—

238
00:19:23,220 --> 00:19:26,460
No, it's not that.

239
00:19:27,170 --> 00:19:30,500
I want to thank her for everything.

240
00:19:30,500 --> 00:19:34,920
She told me I can think

241
00:19:34,920 --> 00:19:38,670
and act on my own.

242
00:19:38,670 --> 00:19:41,280
Tell her I'll keep that in mind.

243
00:19:43,170 --> 00:19:47,230
I did switch because of my mom,

244
00:19:47,230 --> 00:19:50,480
but I really like Ms. Seo.

245
00:19:51,820 --> 00:19:53,970
I'll make sure to tell her.

246
00:19:56,380 --> 00:20:01,060
But I liked you, too, Ms. Min Ji.

247
00:20:01,060 --> 00:20:03,850
Ms. Seo is a bit scary.

248
00:20:03,850 --> 00:20:06,680
I was happy that you were there.

249
00:20:13,010 --> 00:20:15,580
Would you like something to drink?

250
00:20:15,580 --> 00:20:17,060
I need to go to the academy.

251
00:20:17,060 --> 00:20:19,530
Oh, right.

252
00:20:19,530 --> 00:20:21,730
I'll go now.

253
00:20:42,430 --> 00:20:46,490
You two worked hard on the classes and textbooks.

254
00:20:46,490 --> 00:20:50,950
She said she'd give me a scholarship if I brought her Mr. Lee's

255
00:20:50,950 --> 00:20:53,940
class material, students' and parents' contact.

256
00:20:54,540 --> 00:20:59,550
I said I'd send my resume, entrance exam score sheet, and other documents.

257
00:21:03,180 --> 00:21:05,570
Do you want to join them?

258
00:21:05,570 --> 00:21:07,070
Yes.

259
00:21:13,060 --> 00:21:16,290
Why would you tell us this, then?

260
00:21:16,290 --> 00:21:21,830
I've been thinking. Choeseon Korean is the ultimate opponent.

261
00:21:22,830 --> 00:21:24,980
What if I worked as Ms. Seo's spy there—

262
00:21:24,980 --> 00:21:27,080
You're out of your mind.

263
00:21:28,970 --> 00:21:32,020
I wanted to record the conversation, but I got caught.

264
00:21:32,020 --> 00:21:33,340
- What?
 - What?

265
00:21:33,340 --> 00:21:37,420
She asked me to get something from Director Choi, too. For example—

266
00:21:37,420 --> 00:21:39,200
Min Ji.

267
00:21:40,340 --> 00:21:42,340
You don't have to tell us.

268
00:21:44,100 --> 00:21:46,950
She said I have a lot to do.

269
00:21:46,950 --> 00:21:48,790
Min Ji.

270
00:21:52,820 --> 00:21:55,840
Do you feel very hurt by it?

271
00:22:00,340 --> 00:22:01,920
Yes.

272
00:22:05,660 --> 00:22:10,130
She treated me like Yun Ji Seok and Lee Myeong Jun because I'm poor.

273
00:22:10,130 --> 00:22:12,510
It makes me so angry.

274
00:22:12,510 --> 00:22:13,870
I apologize on her behalf.

275
00:22:13,870 --> 00:22:17,300
You don't have to send her your resume. Don't.

276
00:22:18,710 --> 00:22:24,140
What's more annoying is that I couldn't say no on the spot.

277
00:22:24,140 --> 00:22:28,630
I started thinking, "What can I do with that money?"

278
00:22:28,630 --> 00:22:31,150
It's okay. You're human.

279
00:22:31,150 --> 00:22:33,040
No.

280
00:22:33,040 --> 00:22:36,550
I would've been in trouble if it wasn't for Ha Yul.

281
00:22:37,350 --> 00:22:40,590
I ran into her on the way here.

282
00:22:40,590 --> 00:22:43,450
She asked me to tell you,

283
00:22:43,450 --> 00:22:46,450
that she liked you a lot.

284
00:22:47,530 --> 00:22:51,840
And she said she liked me, too.

285
00:22:52,590 --> 00:22:57,570
I was able to become a good teacher thanks to you.

286
00:22:57,570 --> 00:23:01,600
I'm so ashamed that I completely forgot about that.

287
00:23:03,710 --> 00:23:07,360
I'm just a TA, but I'm a teacher, too.

288
00:23:08,160 --> 00:23:11,460
I want to become cool.

289
00:23:11,460 --> 00:23:14,130
Yes, you're cool now.

290
00:23:14,130 --> 00:23:16,450
You don't have to become a spy.

291
00:23:20,330 --> 00:23:24,200
I want to help you.

292
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:27,140
I'm your TA.

293
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:32,150
I appreciate the sentiment.

294
00:23:32,150 --> 00:23:37,120
I want to be helpful to you,

295
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:39,870
but I think I'm only burdening you.

296
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:43,200
It makes me upset.

297
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:47,100
♫  Since I loved you  ♫

298
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:57,500
♫  When you'll be all alone trying to be seen  ♫

299
00:23:58,600 --> 00:24:08,100
♫  Chasing whatever they might call a dream  ♫

300
00:24:08,800 --> 00:24:13,700
♫  But you came after all  ♫

301
00:24:13,700 --> 00:24:18,100
♫  Said look away  ♫

302
00:24:18,990 --> 00:24:24,120
♫  And things were simple then  ♫

303
00:24:24,120 --> 00:24:29,270
♫  Just like they've always been  ♫

304
00:24:29,270 --> 00:24:35,490
♫  Will our love ever end?  ♫

305
00:24:36,800 --> 00:24:40,690
♫  I'll never know  ♫

306
00:25:42,800 --> 00:25:44,360
What?

307
00:25:46,870 --> 00:25:48,580
Min Ji.

308
00:25:49,850 --> 00:25:52,060
What's going on? Min Ji.

309
00:25:52,060 --> 00:25:54,090
What's wrong?

310
00:25:55,380 --> 00:25:57,840
What's wrong, Min Ji? What's wrong?

311
00:26:21,470 --> 00:26:24,410
I thought we just needed to care for the teachers,

312
00:26:25,450 --> 00:26:27,820
but I didn't even think of this.

313
00:26:31,150 --> 00:26:33,790
You're about to pass out.

314
00:26:33,790 --> 00:26:36,000
Drink some water, at least.

315
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:39,970
I'm crazy. I'm out of my mind.

316
00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:45,470
What was I doing

317
00:26:45,470 --> 00:26:48,220
being all stiff in front of the students?

318
00:26:52,470 --> 00:26:56,030
If I just do nothing, I'd be less than human.

319
00:26:57,730 --> 00:26:58,850
What are you trying to do?

320
00:26:58,850 --> 00:27:02,110
I'll bite Wu Seung Hui's ankle like a bug or something.

321
00:27:02,110 --> 00:27:03,970
You'll get stepped on if you don't do it right.

322
00:27:03,970 --> 00:27:06,800
Then, I'll lower myself...

323
00:27:06,800 --> 00:27:10,400
and beg. I'm not going to act superior.

324
00:27:11,940 --> 00:27:14,660
- Try to be rational.
 - I don't want to.

325
00:27:14,660 --> 00:27:16,950
I really don't want to.

326
00:27:20,140 --> 00:27:22,230
It's not Wu Seung Hui.

327
00:27:23,450 --> 00:27:26,700
We need to destroy them properly if we're going to.

328
00:27:28,250 --> 00:27:30,510
I met Mr. Pyo yesterday.

329
00:27:30,510 --> 00:27:32,810
I got a bad feeling from it,

330
00:27:32,810 --> 00:27:36,000
but I just realized why.

331
00:29:00,040 --> 00:29:01,920
Wow, I feel alive now.

332
00:29:04,110 --> 00:29:05,770
Why aren't you eating?

333
00:29:06,380 --> 00:29:08,960
Did Seo Hye Jin make you hangover soup or something?

334
00:29:10,380 --> 00:29:14,390
There's no way she did that. Women are—

335
00:29:14,390 --> 00:29:16,640
You're scared of Wu Seung Hui, right?

336
00:29:19,060 --> 00:29:20,140
What?

337
00:29:20,140 --> 00:29:22,610
She's parading around with Yun Ji Seok

338
00:29:22,610 --> 00:29:25,210
and she promises everyone Ms. Seo's files.

339
00:29:25,210 --> 00:29:28,690
But you can't make a peep because...

340
00:29:28,690 --> 00:29:30,770
you're scared, right?

341
00:29:31,990 --> 00:29:34,160
You should watch what you say.

342
00:29:34,160 --> 00:29:36,810
I haven't decided to be on your side yet.

343
00:29:36,810 --> 00:29:41,210
I'm saying you don't have to be afraid of her.

344
00:30:03,540 --> 00:30:05,160
 Hall of Fame 

345
00:30:21,130 --> 00:30:23,130
I have no regrets.

346
00:30:24,800 --> 00:30:29,280
 Daechi Chase 

347
00:31:04,520 --> 00:31:05,770
So?

348
00:31:05,770 --> 00:31:08,590
The students who are about to be in 12th grade...

349
00:31:08,590 --> 00:31:11,830
My duty is to teach them up to the first semester.

350
00:31:11,830 --> 00:31:13,560
Duty?

351
00:31:15,820 --> 00:31:18,560
I didn't know you cared about impressive things like that.

352
00:31:18,560 --> 00:31:22,890
Moreover, we need to buy some time

353
00:31:22,890 --> 00:31:25,240
so your position becomes secure.

354
00:31:25,240 --> 00:31:26,790
What?

355
00:31:27,490 --> 00:31:30,590
You're saying my position isn't secure?

356
00:31:33,450 --> 00:31:35,560
Pyo Sang Seob...

357
00:31:35,560 --> 00:31:40,650
Choeseon Korean's assistant director has no idea what's going on, either.

358
00:31:40,650 --> 00:31:46,510
Choi Hyeong Seon apparently said she runs the academy on her own.

359
00:31:47,950 --> 00:31:52,810
The moment I joined Choeseon Korean without you, I'd become a kite with its string cut.

360
00:31:54,090 --> 00:31:58,350
I should make a move after you prove your influence here.

361
00:31:58,350 --> 00:32:03,870
Or if you wrote something down on paper with Director Choi,

362
00:32:03,870 --> 00:32:06,030
show me that.

363
00:32:08,300 --> 00:32:11,020
Did you come up with that yourself, Lee Myeong Jun?

364
00:32:11,640 --> 00:32:14,710
Seo Hye Jin has been meeting Director Choi.

365
00:32:15,610 --> 00:32:19,380
 What Choi Hyeong Seon really wants is Seo Hye Jin. 

366
00:32:19,380 --> 00:32:23,940
The worker bee who'd gather students quietly and give her honey.

367
00:32:24,740 --> 00:32:28,910
Only the one who desires to be the queen bee would get ousted.

368
00:32:34,150 --> 00:32:35,840
 Yes. 

369
00:32:41,580 --> 00:32:46,450
I wonder if Director Choi would need you if she gets Seo Hye Jin.

370
00:32:46,450 --> 00:32:48,990
That's what I'm uncertain about.

371
00:33:04,870 --> 00:33:08,680
 Victory (Name of Wu Seung Hui's prior academy that failed.) 

372
00:33:20,210 --> 00:33:22,750
I'll be waiting for your call, Assistant Director.

373
00:33:51,070 --> 00:33:54,560
You got good results for the entrance exam.

374
00:33:55,150 --> 00:33:57,600
You must've done okay, too.

375
00:33:57,600 --> 00:34:00,400
Probably not as well as me, though.

376
00:34:00,400 --> 00:34:02,750
I'm happy.

377
00:34:02,750 --> 00:34:04,120
It's rewarding.

378
00:34:04,120 --> 00:34:08,560
Yes, that ends up becoming your assets.

379
00:34:08,560 --> 00:34:10,140
It'll help you come back, too.

380
00:34:10,140 --> 00:34:11,950
Come back?

381
00:34:14,110 --> 00:34:16,130
Would I...

382
00:34:17,140 --> 00:34:18,680
be able to come back?

383
00:34:18,680 --> 00:34:22,470
Of course. You're still young.

384
00:34:22,470 --> 00:34:25,570
You're underestimating your achievement.

385
00:34:25,570 --> 00:34:28,530
You destroyed me properly.

386
00:34:32,300 --> 00:34:36,190
How am I supposed to make a living from now on?

387
00:34:36,190 --> 00:34:40,530
You came all the way here to ask me that?

388
00:34:40,530 --> 00:34:42,470
Yes.

389
00:34:42,470 --> 00:34:44,900
I thought you'd know the answer.

390
00:34:44,900 --> 00:34:46,480
You're a fighter.

391
00:34:46,480 --> 00:34:49,900
You barged into the school and cut the teacher's throat.

392
00:34:49,900 --> 00:34:53,330
You put out an ad to provoke me.

393
00:34:53,330 --> 00:34:57,270
And you suddenly acted like a mentor.

394
00:34:57,270 --> 00:34:59,330
You're a very impressive person.

395
00:34:59,330 --> 00:35:02,180
That impressive Seo Hye Jin...

396
00:35:03,890 --> 00:35:06,240
got lost.

397
00:35:07,210 --> 00:35:09,140
What would you do if you were me?

398
00:35:09,140 --> 00:35:11,060
If I were you,

399
00:35:11,060 --> 00:35:13,260
I'd join Choeseon.

400
00:35:13,260 --> 00:35:15,510
Along with my beloved student

401
00:35:15,510 --> 00:35:20,310
and be on the big stage I created.

402
00:35:20,310 --> 00:35:26,350
Teacher-Pupil Tag Team Season 2 after the sensational scandal.

403
00:35:27,680 --> 00:35:30,270
We'll use Lee Si Wu as a hype man, too.

404
00:35:30,270 --> 00:35:35,120
If so, everyone will clamor and get in line.

405
00:35:35,120 --> 00:35:37,300
I'm sure you'd get mocked at first.

406
00:35:37,300 --> 00:35:41,180
But you two are good lecturers.

407
00:35:41,180 --> 00:35:44,370
The No. 1 student of Huiwon High takes your class, too.

408
00:35:44,370 --> 00:35:46,720
Once people hear about that,

409
00:35:46,720 --> 00:35:50,140
you'd be able to dominate the exam retakers' market immediately.

410
00:35:50,140 --> 00:35:54,260
People would pay money for that scandal.

411
00:35:56,810 --> 00:35:58,910
Are you interested?

412
00:36:13,310 --> 00:36:16,130
You aren't very insightful.

413
00:36:16,130 --> 00:36:18,300
You're supposed to be a Korean teacher.

414
00:36:18,300 --> 00:36:22,810
I'm the only one who can come up with a scenario like this in Daechi-dong.

415
00:36:22,810 --> 00:36:26,210
But I don't think anything went according...

416
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:29,300
- to your scenario so far. 
- That can't be.

417
00:36:29,300 --> 00:36:31,760
You sent a spy to our free lecture, right?

418
00:36:31,760 --> 00:36:34,710
To check on what we were talking about.

419
00:36:34,710 --> 00:36:36,490
And you ended up losing your spy Si Wu to us.

420
00:36:36,490 --> 00:36:38,720
Lee Si Wu was inadequate.

421
00:36:38,720 --> 00:36:40,830
"We have something in common.

422
00:36:40,830 --> 00:36:43,850
So let's dominate this town." You said that to me.

423
00:36:43,850 --> 00:36:46,130
But I turned you down.

424
00:36:48,200 --> 00:36:49,920
And Mr. Pyo Sang Seob...

425
00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:51,800
That was painful, right?

426
00:36:51,800 --> 00:36:54,560
It was the same for you, right?

427
00:36:54,560 --> 00:37:00,520
You didn't know he wouldn't be interested in the stolen class material.

428
00:37:02,940 --> 00:37:06,450
You tried to take over Chanyeong High using my class material as a hostage,

429
00:37:06,450 --> 00:37:08,460
but it failed, too.

430
00:37:09,610 --> 00:37:16,390
What exactly went according to your scenario that you're so proud of?

431
00:37:16,390 --> 00:37:19,620
Seo Hye Jin is here. Ta-da.

432
00:37:19,620 --> 00:37:22,310
You're asking me to help you make a living.

433
00:37:22,310 --> 00:37:24,550
Will you still insist that it didn't go my way?

434
00:37:24,550 --> 00:37:26,810
I never asked you to help me.

435
00:37:26,810 --> 00:37:28,650
You did from the beginning.

436
00:37:28,650 --> 00:37:32,650
I asked what you'd do if you were me.

437
00:37:32,650 --> 00:37:36,860
I figured I'd be doing the right thing if I did the exact opposite.

438
00:37:36,860 --> 00:37:38,680
It'd make me human.

439
00:37:41,190 --> 00:37:44,490
You couldn't even figure out the exam creator's intention.

440
00:37:45,390 --> 00:37:47,400
You have zero insight.

441
00:38:07,080 --> 00:38:09,200
Bring me a glass of water.

442
00:38:16,380 --> 00:38:18,260
Continue.

443
00:38:18,260 --> 00:38:22,470
You should've noticed when I was suddenly acting like a mentor

444
00:38:22,470 --> 00:38:25,140
that I was walking a different path than you.

445
00:38:25,140 --> 00:38:29,770
I mocked you for being a scoundrel. You didn't get that?

446
00:38:29,770 --> 00:38:34,360
No. It actually woke me up.

447
00:38:34,360 --> 00:38:37,370
A long list of acceptees.

448
00:38:37,370 --> 00:38:40,780
There's something I want besides that.

449
00:38:40,780 --> 00:38:45,330
Three years of reading, writing, laughing, chatting,

450
00:38:45,330 --> 00:38:47,960
dozing off, and waking up

451
00:38:47,960 --> 00:38:50,780
can change someone's life.

452
00:38:51,420 --> 00:38:53,550
That's what I realized.

453
00:38:59,110 --> 00:39:02,300
They say knowledge can punish you.

454
00:39:02,300 --> 00:39:06,060
That's why you failed miserably.

455
00:39:06,060 --> 00:39:09,600
Say something high and mighty on social media instead.

456
00:39:09,600 --> 00:39:11,910
You'd get popular.

457
00:39:13,180 --> 00:39:17,120
I'm telling you not to act morally superior here.

458
00:39:17,120 --> 00:39:21,400
I told you not to speak of ethics. You don't listen.

459
00:39:22,100 --> 00:39:24,480
Acting morally superior...

460
00:39:25,380 --> 00:39:27,720
is your specialty.

461
00:39:51,010 --> 00:39:53,880
 Victory 

462
00:40:04,340 --> 00:40:06,190
 Power Off 

463
00:40:17,600 --> 00:40:20,610
 Level 1 Formula. Daechi Choeseon Korean. 

464
00:40:39,560 --> 00:40:42,740
 I felt weird whenever I came here. 

465
00:40:43,690 --> 00:40:47,020
 Why is the director's office all the way in the back? 

466
00:40:47,840 --> 00:40:51,200
And why is the desk so far from the door?

467
00:40:53,160 --> 00:40:59,010
Why do I have to walk so much to meet you?

468
00:40:59,010 --> 00:41:01,740
That's what authority is.

469
00:41:01,740 --> 00:41:05,400
It's something you never got to have.

470
00:41:06,300 --> 00:41:08,710
How pitiful.

471
00:41:08,710 --> 00:41:13,150
- Me?
 - If you've truly been respected...

472
00:41:13,150 --> 00:41:16,890
If you work hard to be respected,

473
00:41:17,790 --> 00:41:20,350
you wouldn't mistake a room like this for authority.

474
00:41:20,350 --> 00:41:21,680
Ms. Seo Hye Jin.

475
00:41:21,680 --> 00:41:24,390
Wu Seung Hui met my TA.

476
00:41:26,930 --> 00:41:31,450
- So?
 - I'm not sure what they talked about.

477
00:41:33,200 --> 00:41:35,470
But I think you'd know.

478
00:41:35,470 --> 00:41:37,600
I don't know, either.

479
00:41:37,600 --> 00:41:41,160
I never said I needed a TA.

480
00:41:41,160 --> 00:41:45,260
Think about how it felt when you sent Si Wu to us.

481
00:41:46,170 --> 00:41:48,970
Or remember when you got Si Wu to write some weird memorandum?

482
00:41:48,970 --> 00:41:50,700
I didn't make him do that.

483
00:41:50,700 --> 00:41:54,950
How about when you told Mr. Pyo to look at my files?

484
00:41:59,110 --> 00:42:01,990
You love talking about your scenario.

485
00:42:03,090 --> 00:42:05,220
I think Wu Seung Hui is writing one, too.

486
00:42:06,120 --> 00:42:10,170
She willingly sold her soul like you did.

487
00:42:10,170 --> 00:42:13,130
Without an ounce of shame.

488
00:42:15,860 --> 00:42:19,930
I'd believe it if you told me you were twins.

489
00:42:21,990 --> 00:42:27,870
When you created a story about Mr. Lee and me, you must've been totally in sync.

490
00:42:31,070 --> 00:42:35,460
Looks like you found your soulmate, Director.

491
00:42:47,410 --> 00:42:49,190
I'm here to see Director.

492
00:42:49,190 --> 00:42:51,500
She's with a guest right now.

493
00:42:51,500 --> 00:42:54,220
Tell her Lee Jun Ho is here.

494
00:42:54,220 --> 00:42:56,130
From Daechi Chase.

495
00:42:59,260 --> 00:43:01,200
Let them in.

496
00:43:33,260 --> 00:43:37,770
You should've called me if you wanted to switch academies.

497
00:43:37,770 --> 00:43:39,530
I'm disappointed.

498
00:43:40,590 --> 00:43:43,460
I know you don't like me.

499
00:43:43,460 --> 00:43:47,330
There's someone who likes me here. Why would I go to you?

500
00:43:50,580 --> 00:43:53,810
Have a seat. Ms. Seo likes to joke around—

501
00:43:53,810 --> 00:43:56,210
I'm disappointed in you, too.

502
00:43:57,020 --> 00:43:59,430
If you got a call from Seo Hye Jin—

503
00:43:59,430 --> 00:44:02,580
If you witnessed the situation, try to—

504
00:44:02,580 --> 00:44:05,400
You should've discussed it with me first.

505
00:44:05,400 --> 00:44:07,610
We wouldn't have been in this situation, then.

506
00:44:07,610 --> 00:44:08,820
Discuss?

507
00:44:08,820 --> 00:44:16,060
Don't say. You aren't making contact with my teachers without me, are you?

508
00:44:16,060 --> 00:44:18,490
I recommend that. Contact them directly.

509
00:44:18,490 --> 00:44:19,680
Could you, please—

510
00:44:19,680 --> 00:44:23,380
Shouldn't you greet an elder first?

511
00:44:23,380 --> 00:44:26,250
Do you really expect that from me?

512
00:44:27,010 --> 00:44:31,900
Assistant Director is amazing at finding people's weaknesses, but she can't win them over.

513
00:44:31,900 --> 00:44:37,670
You got properly betrayed by your right-hand man today.

514
00:44:37,670 --> 00:44:40,070
Manage the contracts yourself...

515
00:44:40,070 --> 00:44:42,350
for the future of Choeseon Korean.

516
00:44:46,160 --> 00:44:49,530
I'll let you talk. I'll leave now.

517
00:44:56,510 --> 00:44:58,230
Fighting.

518
00:44:59,730 --> 00:45:01,810
Soulmates.

519
00:45:06,750 --> 00:45:08,350
Fighting.

520
00:45:14,450 --> 00:45:17,130
Will they split up?

521
00:45:17,130 --> 00:45:18,780
Who knows.

522
00:45:22,230 --> 00:45:24,240
Hello.

523
00:45:24,240 --> 00:45:26,990
What are you two doing here?

524
00:45:26,990 --> 00:45:29,700
We just saw Director Choi.

525
00:45:32,060 --> 00:45:34,760
Let's grab a tea if you're free.

526
00:45:42,580 --> 00:45:43,980
Let's sit and talk.

527
00:45:43,980 --> 00:45:46,670
You moved out of the apartment.

528
00:45:46,670 --> 00:45:48,990
You didn't discuss that with me, either.

529
00:45:48,990 --> 00:45:52,780
You keep using the word "discuss."

530
00:45:52,780 --> 00:45:57,010
Did you discuss it with me before you

531
00:45:57,010 --> 00:45:59,710
interviewed my TA?

532
00:46:00,700 --> 00:46:06,440
What would I discuss with someone who can't even plant a spy near me?

533
00:46:06,440 --> 00:46:08,430
Let's sit and talk.

534
00:46:22,860 --> 00:46:25,450
I ended up giving you a hint.

535
00:46:26,250 --> 00:46:28,900
You basically showed me the answer sheet.

536
00:46:28,900 --> 00:46:31,470
If Choi Hyeong Seon and Wu Seung Hui split up.

537
00:46:35,610 --> 00:46:38,330
Are you worried?

538
00:46:38,330 --> 00:46:39,830
No.

539
00:46:41,640 --> 00:46:47,080
I thought I should be more harsh to Director Choi.

540
00:46:49,670 --> 00:46:54,080
I'm sorry, but let's talk about the rest later. I have more stuff to do.

541
00:46:54,080 --> 00:46:56,110
Oh, okay.

542
00:46:57,130 --> 00:46:59,340
Seo Hye Jin is a cunning thing.

543
00:46:59,340 --> 00:47:01,430
I don't know what she told you, but—

544
00:47:01,430 --> 00:47:05,350
 I'd believe it if you told me you were twins. 

545
00:47:06,240 --> 00:47:08,380
It's all nonsense.

546
00:47:09,340 --> 00:47:11,610
You know that.

547
00:47:11,610 --> 00:47:18,140
How could you say that I-I was trying to plant a spy?

548
00:47:18,140 --> 00:47:25,400
Do you have a secret I should find out about?

549
00:47:25,400 --> 00:47:27,150
Of course, I do.

550
00:47:28,460 --> 00:47:30,900
Try finding it out.

551
00:47:32,500 --> 00:47:33,860
Director Choi Hyeong Seon.

552
00:47:33,860 --> 00:47:36,440
How much time do you need?

553
00:47:36,440 --> 00:47:38,740
A year? Two years?

554
00:47:38,740 --> 00:47:44,340
Or about ten years, the same amount of time you spent at Daechi Chase?

555
00:47:44,340 --> 00:47:47,940
While cheering you on to try again even if you fail?

556
00:47:47,940 --> 00:47:50,010
Try to be...

557
00:47:50,880 --> 00:47:54,850
respectful when you talk.

558
00:47:54,850 --> 00:47:56,280
We're partners.

559
00:47:56,280 --> 00:48:00,360
You deserve to be a partner when you're on the same level as me.

560
00:48:01,490 --> 00:48:04,630
You don't understand the character of the people you want.

561
00:48:04,630 --> 00:48:07,530
You don't know what Seo Hye Jin is planning.

562
00:48:07,530 --> 00:48:10,620
You don't even know what my secret is.

563
00:48:11,790 --> 00:48:17,470
If you're that slow, just do what you're told to do properly.

564
00:48:17,470 --> 00:48:19,460
Sit when I say, "sit."

565
00:48:19,460 --> 00:48:21,380
Listen when I say, "listen."

566
00:48:21,380 --> 00:48:24,940
And don't do what I didn't tell you to do.

567
00:48:28,510 --> 00:48:33,840
I won't send any of my teachers here.

568
00:48:33,840 --> 00:48:36,150
I'm happy to hear that.

569
00:48:36,150 --> 00:48:38,260
I'll manage things myself.

570
00:48:39,060 --> 00:48:43,790
I'm thinking of hiring Director Kim Hyeon Tak, too.

571
00:48:43,790 --> 00:48:46,660
He seems like a generous leader.

572
00:48:47,760 --> 00:48:49,070
What?

573
00:48:49,970 --> 00:48:55,290
How did he tolerate working with someone like you for ten years?

574
00:49:07,850 --> 00:49:10,130
It's eight years and nine months.

575
00:49:50,290 --> 00:49:52,410
How dare you?

576
00:49:53,260 --> 00:49:56,070
Let go! Let go!

577
00:49:56,070 --> 00:49:57,730
Director!

578
00:49:57,730 --> 00:50:00,330
L-Let go! Let go!

579
00:50:01,460 --> 00:50:04,630
Director, let go! Let go!

580
00:50:04,630 --> 00:50:07,200
Director! Director!

581
00:50:07,200 --> 00:50:11,010
- Director, let go! 
- Hold on!

582
00:50:11,010 --> 00:50:13,000
Hold on!

583
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:16,210
Okay, Directors, you'll

584
00:50:16,210 --> 00:50:20,580
let go on the count of three, okay?

585
00:50:20,580 --> 00:50:25,600
Okay. One, two, three!

586
00:50:25,600 --> 00:50:27,800
Let go and talk!

587
00:50:27,800 --> 00:50:29,640
Again! Let's try again!

588
00:50:29,640 --> 00:50:32,810
- Let go, Director!
 - One!

589
00:50:32,810 --> 00:50:34,240
One!

590
00:50:34,240 --> 00:50:35,850
Please!

591
00:50:35,850 --> 00:50:38,270
Director, l-let go.

592
00:50:39,170 --> 00:50:41,590
L-Let go first!

593
00:50:41,590 --> 00:50:45,400
- Director!
 - Just talk instead!

594
00:50:45,400 --> 00:50:48,010
Pull her. Pull her.

595
00:50:48,010 --> 00:50:51,160
- Director! Director! 
- Move her fingers!

596
00:50:51,160 --> 00:50:53,690
Move her fingers!

597
00:51:08,880 --> 00:51:10,970
I slept too much, didn't I?

598
00:51:10,970 --> 00:51:12,810
Are you awake?

599
00:51:14,630 --> 00:51:17,970
Let me see. Hold on.

600
00:51:18,580 --> 00:51:21,160
You feel less hot.

601
00:51:21,160 --> 00:51:22,680
How do you feel? Are you okay?

602
00:51:22,680 --> 00:51:25,760
Yes, I feel better.

603
00:51:25,760 --> 00:51:27,640
Drink some.

604
00:51:36,350 --> 00:51:38,850
You must've been shocked.

605
00:51:38,850 --> 00:51:40,820
I've been inattentive.

606
00:51:40,820 --> 00:51:44,860
You haven't slept or eaten, and you've been crying a lot, getting dehydrated.

607
00:51:44,860 --> 00:51:46,670
It's okay.

608
00:51:48,370 --> 00:51:50,040
What? Do you need something?

609
00:51:50,040 --> 00:51:51,930
My phone. I need to call Min Ji.

610
00:51:51,930 --> 00:51:54,870
I called her. I called her.

611
00:52:10,020 --> 00:52:13,020
That wasn't a movie earlier, right?

612
00:52:14,400 --> 00:52:17,320
Choi Hyeong Seon and Wu Seung Hui

613
00:52:18,220 --> 00:52:21,950
The video is more popular than most hit movies.

614
00:52:23,080 --> 00:52:25,230
The students filmed it.

615
00:52:27,720 --> 00:52:29,750
According to the rumor,

616
00:52:29,750 --> 00:52:34,670
they might sue each other since they're both furious.

617
00:52:34,670 --> 00:52:36,270
Wow.

618
00:52:36,270 --> 00:52:38,650
I don't even have the energy to laugh.

619
00:52:45,180 --> 00:52:48,110
I should make you exercise starting the spring break.

620
00:52:48,840 --> 00:52:51,520
How can I live with you forever at this rate?

621
00:52:57,400 --> 00:52:59,300
You'd do what?

622
00:52:59,300 --> 00:53:03,010
Why are you so surprised? You're hurting my feelings.

623
00:53:04,910 --> 00:53:07,170
Aren't you going to live with me?

624
00:53:22,820 --> 00:53:24,910
Did you have dinner?

625
00:53:25,710 --> 00:53:29,370
I had some snacks. Why? Are you hungry?

626
00:53:32,350 --> 00:53:34,380
I want ice cream.

627
00:53:34,380 --> 00:53:35,950
Ice cream?

628
00:53:38,660 --> 00:53:40,120
Hold on.

629
00:53:42,400 --> 00:53:44,570
Can you have it?

630
00:53:44,570 --> 00:53:47,600
Right now? I'm about to say something important-

631
00:53:47,600 --> 00:53:49,400
That's why.

632
00:53:52,510 --> 00:53:54,260
Get me some.

633
00:53:56,280 --> 00:53:57,850
Okay.

634
00:54:06,070 --> 00:54:07,700
What flavor?

635
00:54:10,910 --> 00:54:12,620
Okay.

636
00:54:15,640 --> 00:54:18,390
 You'll let go at a count of three, okay? 

637
00:54:18,390 --> 00:54:21,100
 - You can't film.
 - Isn't that Director? 

638
00:54:21,100 --> 00:54:24,100
 You can't film! You can't film! 

639
00:54:24,100 --> 00:54:26,930
Wow, this is crazy.

640
00:54:26,930 --> 00:54:29,540
Why are they so vicious?

641
00:54:29,540 --> 00:54:30,860
Isn't it crazy?

642
00:54:30,860 --> 00:54:32,370
Yes.

643
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:39,600
My mom should start working out.

644
00:54:41,010 --> 00:54:44,640
To run an academy, it looks like

645
00:54:44,640 --> 00:54:48,550
you need to be strong, fit, and gutsy.

646
00:54:50,820 --> 00:54:53,940
Let's leave before the buses stop running.

647
00:54:59,140 --> 00:55:01,240
Should I buy a car?

648
00:55:02,200 --> 00:55:07,110
You could if you can afford it. But why?

649
00:55:07,110 --> 00:55:10,890
I'm sad you always worry about catching the last bus.

650
00:55:11,850 --> 00:55:13,470
I don't need stuff like that.

651
00:55:13,470 --> 00:55:16,280
What do you think taxis are for?

652
00:55:16,280 --> 00:55:20,140
I feel guilty not having a car as a boyfriend.

653
00:55:23,620 --> 00:55:25,030
- Sir.
  - Yes. 

654
00:55:25,030 --> 00:55:27,580
We'll have a bottle of soju and today's drinking snack.

655
00:55:27,580 --> 00:55:30,270
 - Okay!  
- Okay.

656
00:55:30,270 --> 00:55:32,420
All of a sudden?

657
00:55:32,420 --> 00:55:37,690
Let's have an in-depth conversation.

658
00:55:41,100 --> 00:55:42,740
Okay.

659
00:55:46,630 --> 00:55:48,260
What's the topic of your thesis?

660
00:55:48,260 --> 00:55:50,970
My thesis? All of a sudden?

661
00:55:50,970 --> 00:55:52,610
Tell me.

662
00:55:56,070 --> 00:55:58,510
I can talk about it all night if you let me.

663
00:55:58,510 --> 00:56:01,000
That's why I ordered alcohol.

664
00:56:05,580 --> 00:56:08,590
The period is the Northern Song Dynasty.

665
00:56:10,830 --> 00:56:12,700
Hold on.

666
00:56:12,700 --> 00:56:15,300
Let me hear the reason first.

667
00:56:16,510 --> 00:56:21,900
I don't care if you can't afford a car forever.

668
00:56:22,800 --> 00:56:26,660
I can just buy you a car tomorrow or something.

669
00:56:29,650 --> 00:56:34,780
That's touching, but how does that concern my thesis?

670
00:56:34,780 --> 00:56:36,340
Instead,

671
00:56:37,230 --> 00:56:42,380
don't ever complain about being a poor graduate student.

672
00:56:43,800 --> 00:56:45,240
Sorry.

673
00:56:45,240 --> 00:56:49,870
If you want an expensive meal, ask me, not Mr. Lee.

674
00:56:49,870 --> 00:56:51,880
Get a doctoral degree if you want to.

675
00:56:51,880 --> 00:56:54,980
If you don't want to graduate, you never have to.

676
00:56:54,980 --> 00:57:00,190
Anyway, see through your study subject completely.

677
00:57:01,400 --> 00:57:05,590
So, I can't brag about making money as an academy teacher.

678
00:57:14,680 --> 00:57:17,320
What? What's wrong?

679
00:57:17,320 --> 00:57:20,200
How do I deserve someone like you?

680
00:57:26,770 --> 00:57:28,590
How cute.

681
00:57:31,240 --> 00:57:32,840
Take it.

682
00:57:49,090 --> 00:57:51,440
 Daechi Chase Korean Workbook - 11th Grade

 Korean Modern Poetry / Milestone / The Jehol Diary...] 

690
00:59:28,880 --> 00:59:31,990
 Introduction to Law 

691
00:59:39,690 --> 00:59:41,750
 I like you. 

692
00:59:41,750 --> 00:59:45,980
I can't imagine myself without you.

693
00:59:47,660 --> 00:59:50,550
- If so— 
- But...

694
00:59:50,550 --> 00:59:54,280
I never imagined our life together.

695
00:59:57,080 --> 00:59:59,010
Are you disappointed?

696
01:00:00,010 --> 01:00:01,770
Very much.

697
01:00:03,830 --> 01:00:05,670
Why don't you start imagining that today—

698
01:00:05,670 --> 01:00:07,850
To imagine such a thing,

699
01:00:10,400 --> 01:00:13,300
my future is too bleak.

700
01:00:14,770 --> 01:00:16,550
You can get the students back.

701
01:00:16,550 --> 01:00:18,540
It's not that.

702
01:00:20,630 --> 01:00:22,290
The academy.

703
01:00:27,490 --> 01:00:30,020
I think I could quit.

704
01:00:33,650 --> 01:00:35,500
The year you started college,

705
01:00:35,500 --> 01:00:38,460
Director Kim bought me a used car.

706
01:00:39,710 --> 01:00:41,140
I remember.

707
01:00:41,140 --> 01:00:43,960
You got a car when you had no license.

708
01:00:45,320 --> 01:00:48,450
That was enough to give me confidence.

709
01:00:48,450 --> 01:00:51,560
I was always the poorest one among my friends.

710
01:00:51,560 --> 01:00:54,020
But it felt like my status changed.

711
01:00:54,700 --> 01:00:57,230
I was so happy to work then.

712
01:00:57,840 --> 01:00:59,800
I even forgot why I made money later.

713
01:00:59,800 --> 01:01:02,260
Because money itself became the goal.

714
01:01:03,420 --> 01:01:05,460
I started to make tuition money.

715
01:01:05,460 --> 01:01:09,420
But I neglected my studies. I barely managed not to flunk.

716
01:01:11,360 --> 01:01:13,280
But...

717
01:01:14,180 --> 01:01:18,460
when I lost most of my students, I suddenly realized...

718
01:01:19,230 --> 01:01:22,330
why I tried to make money.

719
01:01:23,570 --> 01:01:25,160
Isn't that funny?

720
01:01:26,050 --> 01:01:27,790
It's not.

721
01:01:28,800 --> 01:01:32,720
You said you destroyed everything I achieved,

722
01:01:32,720 --> 01:01:34,340
but no.

723
01:01:34,340 --> 01:01:36,590
I don't think so.

724
01:01:40,290 --> 01:01:46,170
I guess you could say I finally removed the blindfold after all these years.

725
01:01:49,370 --> 01:01:51,700
Then I realized...

726
01:01:53,180 --> 01:01:56,480
what I was supposed to study a long time ago.

727
01:02:00,880 --> 01:02:03,370
I can't guarantee the result.

728
01:02:04,050 --> 01:02:06,560
I don't even know how long it'd take.

729
01:02:06,560 --> 01:02:10,630
But if I achieve something, then,

730
01:02:10,630 --> 01:02:12,950
you should give me...

731
01:02:14,020 --> 01:02:16,120
the shiny diploma.

732
01:02:23,210 --> 01:02:25,430
I'll give you everything you ask for.

733
01:02:26,520 --> 01:02:28,280
Thank you.

734
01:02:29,580 --> 01:02:35,590
But whatever you want, let me support you.

735
01:02:40,750 --> 01:02:42,790
I'll wait for your response.

736
01:02:46,070 --> 01:02:47,770
How sweet.

737
01:02:51,870 --> 01:02:54,760
Mom's going to work.

738
01:02:54,760 --> 01:02:56,500
Hold on, Mom!

739
01:02:56,500 --> 01:02:58,360
Yes?

740
01:02:58,360 --> 01:02:59,830
What?

741
01:02:59,830 --> 01:03:01,730
Hold on, Mom.

742
01:03:01,730 --> 01:03:03,170
Have a seat here for a second.

743
01:03:03,170 --> 01:03:05,410
What? Do you need money?

744
01:03:05,510 --> 01:03:07,470
Just have a seat.

745
01:03:09,100 --> 01:03:10,570
What?

746
01:03:15,150 --> 01:03:17,310
Mom, let me get married.

747
01:03:19,310 --> 01:03:20,990
I need to.

748
01:03:21,980 --> 01:03:23,880
Do you have a woman?

749
01:03:23,880 --> 01:03:26,620
I'm asking because I do.

750
01:03:27,970 --> 01:03:29,550
What does she do?

751
01:03:29,550 --> 01:03:31,990
How old is she, and how long has it been?

752
01:03:33,230 --> 01:03:35,020
It's Ms. Nam Cheong Mi.

753
01:03:38,370 --> 01:03:40,820
All of my married seniors said...

754
01:03:40,820 --> 01:03:45,170
you recognize the person you'd marry from Day 1.

755
01:03:47,720 --> 01:03:51,430
I think I'll marry Ms. Nam.

756
01:03:54,090 --> 01:03:57,120
You know the apartment you bought in Pyeongchon?

757
01:03:57,120 --> 01:03:59,050
Let me have it.

758
01:03:59,050 --> 01:04:01,470
Start an academy there, too.

759
01:04:01,470 --> 01:04:03,320
I'll take it as a wedding gift.

760
01:04:38,160 --> 01:04:40,280
You came in early.

761
01:04:48,140 --> 01:04:50,000
What are you reading so intently?

762
01:04:50,000 --> 01:04:52,280
You didn't even notice I was here.

763
01:04:53,630 --> 01:04:56,000
I'm watching videos of star lecturers.

764
01:04:59,210 --> 01:05:02,860
I'm watching your and Mr. Lee's lectures, too.

765
01:05:02,860 --> 01:05:04,290
Me?

766
01:05:05,830 --> 01:05:07,670
I felt motivated

767
01:05:07,670 --> 01:05:10,140
because my colleagues are too powerful.

768
01:05:14,710 --> 01:05:18,080
Do you always come in this early? I didn't know.

769
01:05:18,080 --> 01:05:21,690
I do. I'm an ambitious type.

770
01:05:22,900 --> 01:05:24,680
I'll let you finish.

771
01:05:27,460 --> 01:05:28,870
- Good morning.
 - Hello.

772
01:05:28,870 --> 01:05:30,790
- Hello.
 - Hello.

773
01:05:31,820 --> 01:05:34,800
- You came in early. 
- Of course.

774
01:05:37,830 --> 01:05:39,980
Let me see.

775
01:05:48,890 --> 01:05:54,550
Don't joke around, and be serious.

776
01:05:54,550 --> 01:05:56,860
I just told you.

777
01:05:56,860 --> 01:05:59,940
How could I be more serious than this?

778
01:06:03,940 --> 01:06:07,100
"What will you do with that degree?

779
01:06:07,100 --> 01:06:09,260
When can you become a professor?"

780
01:06:09,260 --> 01:06:12,340
She's the first person who didn't ask that.

781
01:06:14,590 --> 01:06:19,110
She makes me feel so assured.

782
01:06:20,210 --> 01:06:25,030
Ms. Nam likes you, too? Really?

783
01:06:26,250 --> 01:06:28,970
Are you worried about her instead of me?

784
01:06:29,840 --> 01:06:32,610
Did you seduce her properly?

785
01:06:35,610 --> 01:06:37,990
Start an academy in Pyeongchon for her.

786
01:06:37,990 --> 01:06:40,690
I think I could seduce her better then.

787
01:06:40,690 --> 01:06:42,480
Are you crazy?

788
01:06:44,430 --> 01:06:47,370
Why would you go all the way there?

789
01:06:47,370 --> 01:06:50,150
We might as well have a showdown here.

790
01:06:51,210 --> 01:06:52,570
What?

791
01:06:57,960 --> 01:07:02,360
 Assistant Director's Office 

792
01:07:50,280 --> 01:07:53,170
Why are you staring at me like that?

793
01:07:53,170 --> 01:07:58,650
Everyone knows I've been wanting to start an academy.

794
01:07:58,650 --> 01:08:01,590
I know, but...

795
01:08:01,590 --> 01:08:03,550
Wait...

796
01:08:03,550 --> 01:08:05,650
so...

797
01:08:05,650 --> 01:08:08,690
Academies are all about branding, too.

798
01:08:08,690 --> 01:08:14,490
You've been working so hard on this. It'd be a waste to let it die.

799
01:08:14,490 --> 01:08:17,210
So, you mean—

800
01:08:17,210 --> 01:08:20,540
Maintain the teachers' salaries.

801
01:08:20,540 --> 01:08:23,250
You have to show support with money.

802
01:08:23,250 --> 01:08:26,650
And we need to aim for the next semester.

803
01:08:26,650 --> 01:08:30,870
Have another major hiring event like last time.

804
01:08:36,360 --> 01:08:39,340
You must want something in return.

805
01:08:43,290 --> 01:08:47,240
Tell me. You can have the assistant director's office tomorrow...

806
01:08:47,240 --> 01:08:49,410
I mean, you can have it today.

807
01:08:49,410 --> 01:08:52,490
No, it's not like that.

808
01:08:53,570 --> 01:08:55,570
Gosh, well...

809
01:08:55,570 --> 01:08:58,260
If so...

810
01:08:58,260 --> 01:09:01,640
I do have one request.

811
01:09:02,500 --> 01:09:10,380
I want you to make Ms. Nam the academy's main lecturer.

812
01:09:13,120 --> 01:09:16,990
Team Leader Seo...

813
01:09:18,220 --> 01:09:23,730
can't be the face of our academy anymore.

814
01:09:23,730 --> 01:09:26,130
I agree, but—

815
01:09:26,130 --> 01:09:31,130
Ms. Nam is very talented and has star power.

816
01:09:31,130 --> 01:09:33,470
She's very cute, too.

817
01:09:34,170 --> 01:09:38,370
- She does qualify. She's meticulous, too.
 - Yes.

818
01:09:39,430 --> 01:09:43,550
I understand why you think Seo Hye Jin won't be good, but

819
01:09:43,550 --> 01:09:46,090
why did you choose Ms. Nam?

820
01:09:46,990 --> 01:09:52,480
She can make a billion a year easily.

821
01:09:53,380 --> 01:09:58,010
I want to help her grow and give her to my son.

822
01:09:58,010 --> 01:09:59,820
You mean the academy?

823
01:10:01,830 --> 01:10:03,910
No.

824
01:10:04,590 --> 01:10:07,380
I meant Ms. Nam.

825
01:10:22,570 --> 01:10:24,250
Let's switch.

826
01:10:24,250 --> 01:10:27,460
No, you drink too much coffee.

827
01:10:28,110 --> 01:10:32,020
There are so many other drinks. Why the jujube ssanghwacha?

828
01:10:32,020 --> 01:10:33,930
Makes me look old.

829
01:10:35,120 --> 01:10:38,840
I want you to live a long time.

830
01:10:40,430 --> 01:10:43,520
You don't look old. You're pretty.

831
01:10:43,520 --> 01:10:46,810
Try it first. I'll get you something else if you hate it.

832
01:10:46,810 --> 01:10:48,860
I don't like it.

833
01:10:58,000 --> 01:11:01,830
You said new things have been happening because of me.

834
01:11:01,830 --> 01:11:04,960
Was it the day we kissed for the first time?

835
01:11:04,960 --> 01:11:06,360
Hey.

836
01:11:09,600 --> 01:11:14,400
I'll let you try new food and take you to new places.

837
01:11:40,220 --> 01:11:46,160
Someone's willing to invest in the academy until we get reestablished.

838
01:11:48,860 --> 01:11:50,890
It's Manager Kim.

839
01:11:50,890 --> 01:11:54,550
That's great. That's really great.

840
01:11:58,580 --> 01:12:02,670
Why do you look so sad, then?

841
01:12:04,130 --> 01:12:10,840
Manager Kim wants to replace the lead lecturer.

842
01:12:11,510 --> 01:12:17,260
She doesn't think Hye Jin can be the face of the academy.

843
01:12:19,300 --> 01:12:20,970
I'm sorry.

844
01:12:20,970 --> 01:12:24,350
It's so hard for me to say no.

845
01:12:25,550 --> 01:12:27,940
She wants Ms. Nam.

846
01:12:31,770 --> 01:12:34,850
Wow, I'm disappointed in Manager Kim.

847
01:12:35,780 --> 01:12:37,700
How could Seung Gyu's mother...

848
01:12:37,700 --> 01:12:41,180
Team Leader Lee would be very disappointed.

849
01:12:41,970 --> 01:12:46,380
He must be dreaming of becoming the hero of the academy.

850
01:12:47,620 --> 01:12:51,610
What are you talking about? I won't renew his contract.

851
01:12:56,980 --> 01:12:58,370
Geez...

852
01:12:59,410 --> 01:13:02,570
What do you think, Team Leader Seo?

853
01:13:07,690 --> 01:13:09,870
I'll waive my vote.

854
01:13:09,870 --> 01:13:11,630
What?

855
01:13:11,630 --> 01:13:13,280
I'll waive.

856
01:13:19,270 --> 01:13:22,810
 Daechi Chase 

857
01:13:41,590 --> 01:13:44,810
Isn't there a fancy term for...

858
01:13:44,810 --> 01:13:47,030
buying a government position?

859
01:13:49,100 --> 01:13:50,640
"Maegwanmaegik"?

860
01:13:50,640 --> 01:13:54,140
Come on. This is an investment.

861
01:13:55,040 --> 01:13:57,060
Why are you laughing?

862
01:13:57,060 --> 01:13:59,390
Do you really think I bought her the position?

863
01:13:59,390 --> 01:14:05,280
A student once asked if "maegwanmaegik" was a kind of magic.

864
01:14:07,590 --> 01:14:10,260
Gosh, kids...

865
01:14:11,430 --> 01:14:15,420
I'll even miss the ones who said ridiculous things.

866
01:14:21,180 --> 01:14:25,460
Gosh, I'm so sad, Team Leader Seo.

867
01:14:28,550 --> 01:14:29,930
Are you done packing?

868
01:14:29,930 --> 01:14:32,560
Yes, pretty much.

869
01:14:32,560 --> 01:14:34,920
Shouldn't you call a moving truck?

870
01:14:34,920 --> 01:14:37,460
You've been here for ten years.

871
01:14:37,460 --> 01:14:39,780
I've been moving a lot of it.

872
01:14:41,310 --> 01:14:43,960
Please take good care of Min Ji.

873
01:14:43,960 --> 01:14:48,260
She needs to care for me. She's more experienced than me.

874
01:14:48,260 --> 01:14:52,200
Mr. Lee protested for four days, asking for Min Ji.

875
01:14:52,200 --> 01:14:54,790
Don't forget that I supported you.

876
01:14:55,960 --> 01:14:57,640
I'll buy you a drink.

877
01:14:57,640 --> 01:14:59,720
You're free today, right?

878
01:14:59,720 --> 01:15:01,310
Maybe next time.

879
01:15:01,310 --> 01:15:03,690
I have an important plan today.

880
01:15:03,690 --> 01:15:05,160
Huh?

881
01:15:06,210 --> 01:15:07,970
I'm teaching my last class.

882
01:15:32,750 --> 01:15:36,780
 Train yourself to articulate your thoughts. 

883
01:15:36,780 --> 01:15:42,350
When you can articulate your thoughts into clean sentences,

884
01:15:42,350 --> 01:15:45,330
you can understand other people's writings easily, too.

885
01:15:45,330 --> 01:15:48,630
Without that training, going through a ton of workbooks

886
01:15:48,630 --> 01:15:52,450
would only mean you let luck decide your grades.

887
01:15:52,450 --> 01:15:55,540
Studying like that could get you

888
01:15:55,540 --> 01:15:59,190
a good grade if you were in good condition that day.

889
01:15:59,190 --> 01:16:03,510
But what would happen if you mistakenly think that's really your grade?

890
01:16:04,560 --> 01:16:05,990
Yes.

891
01:16:05,990 --> 01:16:10,120
You'll be crying on TV the day you get the entrance exam result.

892
01:16:11,580 --> 01:16:13,770
If you properly...

893
01:16:13,770 --> 01:16:17,020
train your vocabulary, sentence structure, and expression skills,

894
01:16:17,020 --> 01:16:19,800
you'd finally have a consistent grade...

895
01:16:19,800 --> 01:16:24,130
and your studies will become your permanent assets.

896
01:16:24,130 --> 01:16:26,640
- Understand? 
- Yes.

897
01:16:26,640 --> 01:16:28,190
Any questions?

898
01:16:30,240 --> 01:16:32,820
 Call me "Teacher." 

899
01:16:34,220 --> 01:16:35,730
Teacher.

900
01:16:37,260 --> 01:16:39,450
Tell me about your first love.

901
01:16:41,490 --> 01:16:43,150
- Hey, Seo Hye Jin.
 - Yes.

902
01:16:43,150 --> 01:16:46,740
You use advanced skills sometimes.

903
01:16:47,940 --> 01:16:51,370
Mr. Lee, are you married?

904
01:16:52,460 --> 01:16:54,190
Not yet.

905
01:16:54,190 --> 01:16:57,170
I'm begging someone to marry me.

906
01:16:57,170 --> 01:16:59,380
Mr. Lee, fighting.

907
01:16:59,380 --> 01:17:01,950
Gosh, seriously.

908
01:17:01,950 --> 01:17:04,770
I might as well ask you since you're a girl.

909
01:17:04,770 --> 01:17:06,880
- Am I a girl?
 - Yeah...

910
01:17:08,380 --> 01:17:10,390
An apartment in Gangnam.

911
01:17:10,390 --> 01:17:12,790
Do you need stuff like that to get her to say yes?

912
01:17:12,790 --> 01:17:13,950
Probably not.

913
01:17:13,950 --> 01:17:17,820
Do I need to put balloons in a hotel room, buy a designer purse,

914
01:17:17,820 --> 01:17:20,110
and prepare an event?

915
01:17:20,860 --> 01:17:22,640
Probably not.

I want to let them know she's taken.
