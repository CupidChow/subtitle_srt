14

15
00:01:01,430 --> 00:01:04,000
Min Ji, please clean up the rest for me.

16
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,100
Okay, Ms. Seo. Hurry up and go upstairs.

17
00:01:06,100 --> 00:01:09,250
I'm curious about the new Huiwon High students, too.

18
00:01:47,060 --> 00:01:48,870
Oh, hello.

19
00:01:54,630 --> 00:01:56,570
Oh, are you finished with the class?

20
00:01:56,570 --> 00:01:59,700
Yes, where's Mr. Lee Jun Ho...

21
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:02,160
He went home.

22
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:03,430
By chance, with the Director?

23
00:02:03,430 --> 00:02:06,000
No, they left separately.

24
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:11,290
Oh, right.

25
00:02:12,990 --> 00:02:16,150
Congratulations on the Huiwon class.

26
00:02:16,150 --> 00:02:17,980
Thank you.

27
00:02:48,140 --> 00:02:54,130
 Teacher 

28
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:23,520
 Where are you? 

29
00:03:30,260 --> 00:03:32,160
 Are you sleeping? 

30
00:03:53,490 --> 00:03:55,300
Hello, Ms. Seo.

31
00:04:07,110 --> 00:04:09,180
Where were you?

32
00:04:10,490 --> 00:04:12,740
I was just getting some fresh air.

33
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:16,130
You have to start using your throat a lot starting now.

34
00:04:16,130 --> 00:04:17,880
Be careful not to catch cold.

35
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:20,690
Watch the wind and weather when you go out, too.

36
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:25,650
Don't you have anything to tell me?

37
00:04:25,650 --> 00:04:29,290
Let's hear how you feel, Mr. Lee.

38
00:04:31,100 --> 00:04:34,110
How does it feel to have your first student?

39
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:40,940
I feel like I could get stars or the moon for Si Wu.

40
00:04:40,940 --> 00:04:44,390
Help him reach Level 1. Not something difficult like the moon.

41
00:04:45,550 --> 00:04:47,500
What's going on?

42
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:50,530
Are you scared now that you finally have a student?

43
00:04:51,110 --> 00:04:54,370
It's okay. There's time until the first class. If you prepare a lot—

44
00:04:54,370 --> 00:04:57,010
- Ms. Seo.
 - Yes, tell me.

45
00:04:57,010 --> 00:04:59,860
Forget about everything I said earlier today.

46
00:04:59,860 --> 00:05:03,070
You can join Choeseon Korean.

47
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:10,400
What? You said you'd give me all the students you get.

48
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:11,710
Did you regret it on second thought?

49
00:05:11,710 --> 00:05:14,320
- It's not like that.
 - What is it, then?

50
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:23,000
Si Wu wants to go to Seoul University.

51
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:27,030
He needs to go to a school with cheap tuition since his family isn't well-off.

52
00:05:27,830 --> 00:05:30,540
He said he wants to start liking Korean.

53
00:05:30,540 --> 00:05:34,010
He's nervous about answering questions because he's been blindly memorizing.

54
00:05:34,650 --> 00:05:37,020
The adults want him to go to medical school

55
00:05:37,020 --> 00:05:40,830
and he thinks he needs to meet their expectations

56
00:05:40,830 --> 00:05:42,900
but is not sure if that's what he wants.

57
00:05:42,900 --> 00:05:49,630
So, he wants to find out what he wants to do before he is 20.

58
00:05:49,630 --> 00:05:51,990
What does that have to do with Choeseon Korean?

59
00:05:51,990 --> 00:05:55,230
I want to help him achieve everything he said.

60
00:05:55,230 --> 00:05:58,720
I want to send him to Seoul University and like Korean, too.

61
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:00,770
And help him decide on a career path.

62
00:06:01,570 --> 00:06:03,180
So?

63
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:07,270
I wonder if you feel that way about me, too.

64
00:06:07,270 --> 00:06:08,930
What about it?

65
00:06:10,460 --> 00:06:13,170
You can't be like that, can you?

66
00:06:13,170 --> 00:06:14,470
I graduated a long time ago.

67
00:06:14,470 --> 00:06:16,610
We're just colleagues now.

68
00:06:16,610 --> 00:06:21,780
Not letting you leave now would be an awful thing to do.

69
00:06:23,760 --> 00:06:27,580
Should I get you some tea if you don't want alcohol?

70
00:06:27,580 --> 00:06:30,780
I dried bellflower roots to serve the teachers.

71
00:06:30,780 --> 00:06:33,180
- I heard they're good for your throat.
 - That sounds good.

72
00:06:33,180 --> 00:06:36,040
Hot tea sounds good, right?

73
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:38,600
- We'll have some. Thank you.
 - Okay.

74
00:06:40,630 --> 00:06:43,690
Don't overreact. I can manage myself.

75
00:06:44,430 --> 00:06:47,140
What will you do, exactly?

76
00:06:47,140 --> 00:06:49,250
Just eat. Do I have to tell you that, too?

77
00:06:49,250 --> 00:06:51,400
Does managing yourself mean...

78
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:55,240
taking care of an old student while suffering loss?

79
00:06:56,580 --> 00:06:58,770
What's wrong with you?

80
00:06:58,770 --> 00:07:01,740
Why did you step down as the ad model?

81
00:07:05,250 --> 00:07:07,000
Most importantly,

82
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:12,980
I'm so happy that our first student is such an excellent student.

83
00:07:12,980 --> 00:07:14,960
Don't you agree?

84
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:18,670
A top student is better than ten ads.

85
00:07:18,670 --> 00:07:20,960
This is a great thing, Mr. Lee.

86
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:22,110
Yes.

87
00:07:22,110 --> 00:07:24,350
You did great.

88
00:07:24,350 --> 00:07:26,380
You were probably short on time,

89
00:07:26,380 --> 00:07:30,460
but you prepared for counseling. That's impressive, too.

90
00:07:30,460 --> 00:07:32,180
Thank you.

91
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:34,760
This is only the beginning.

92
00:07:34,760 --> 00:07:41,250
The memory of today's victory will fortify you throughout your future career.

93
00:07:41,250 --> 00:07:44,100
Don't ever lose the beginner's spirit.

94
00:07:44,100 --> 00:07:46,080
Got it.

95
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:48,750
It is a moment to celebrate,

96
00:07:48,750 --> 00:07:50,500
but unfortunately, I already made plans.

97
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:53,280
Right, you were about to leave.

98
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:54,860
- Let's all leave, then.
 - Yes.

99
00:07:54,860 --> 00:07:56,260
Well, then.

100
00:07:59,150 --> 00:08:01,520
Mr. Lee, just one moment.

101
00:08:14,090 --> 00:08:16,070
Lee Jun Ho.

102
00:08:16,070 --> 00:08:17,400
Yes?

103
00:08:25,770 --> 00:08:28,270
You did a great job.

104
00:08:28,270 --> 00:08:31,030
You guys are...

105
00:08:31,030 --> 00:08:33,350
really the best.

106
00:08:34,050 --> 00:08:35,900
Thank you.

107
00:08:35,900 --> 00:08:38,360
It's been frustrating for me

108
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:42,980
since I couldn't play favorites as a director.

109
00:08:42,980 --> 00:08:44,220
I see.

110
00:08:44,220 --> 00:08:48,740
I knew we could pull it off.

111
00:08:48,740 --> 00:08:50,950
The three of us have a long history.

112
00:08:50,950 --> 00:08:55,710
The newbie director, teacher, and the dumb kid

113
00:08:55,710 --> 00:09:00,010
are the ones who shocked the whole of Daechi-dong.

114
00:09:00,010 --> 00:09:03,880
We're a fantastic team.

115
00:09:03,880 --> 00:09:06,080
Search the entire Deachi-dong.

116
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:12,990
Who here has the guts to use a new teacher in their ad?

117
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:18,550
Other directors wouldn't have accepted a suggestion like that.

118
00:09:19,620 --> 00:09:21,040
What do you mean, suggestion?

119
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:22,840
Come on.

120
00:09:22,840 --> 00:09:26,460
Seo Hye Jin stepped down as an ad model,

121
00:09:26,460 --> 00:09:28,940
Lee Jun Ho raised the stakes,

122
00:09:28,940 --> 00:09:34,530
and I was there for you during the challenge.

123
00:09:37,740 --> 00:09:43,230
The strong bond from the past brought today's miracle.

124
00:09:44,690 --> 00:09:46,980
I guess the Director is getting scared.

125
00:09:46,980 --> 00:09:49,620
That's why he wants to insist we're a team.

126
00:09:49,620 --> 00:09:50,890
Ms. Seo.

127
00:09:50,890 --> 00:09:54,130
I wanted you to be noticed by a major academy and get scouted.

128
00:09:54,130 --> 00:09:56,320
You said you have to make tons of money.

129
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:59,200
I didn't say that, expecting you to sacrifice.

130
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:04,040
You're making it sound like I'm some sort of a martyr. It's not a big deal.

131
00:10:04,040 --> 00:10:06,410
Stop joking around.

132
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,960
I felt so guilty I thought I'd die.

133
00:10:12,680 --> 00:10:16,710
If I asked you to do something again or stay another year with me,

134
00:10:16,710 --> 00:10:19,220
doesn't that make me crazy?

135
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:22,580
Don't overreact, I said.

136
00:10:22,580 --> 00:10:25,180
I take back everything I said earlier today.

137
00:10:25,180 --> 00:10:29,290
Just do whatever you want to do, okay?

138
00:10:35,370 --> 00:10:38,280
You're really ready to be on your own.

139
00:10:38,280 --> 00:10:40,000
I'm not joking right now.

140
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,310
Makes me proud to hear you say that after gaining a student with difficulty.

141
00:10:42,310 --> 00:10:46,610
Proud? Stop acting like you're the only adult here.

142
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:52,610
How disappointing.

143
00:10:54,510 --> 00:10:56,540
Wh-What is?

144
00:10:59,060 --> 00:11:01,530
I know. What am I disappointed about?

145
00:11:02,610 --> 00:11:05,490
I guess I liked hearing that you needed me.

146
00:11:08,150 --> 00:11:11,330
We always wait for others to choose us.

147
00:11:11,330 --> 00:11:14,160
There are too many academies and teachers here.

148
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:16,250
So, we always scream at the top of our lungs, saying,

149
00:11:16,250 --> 00:11:20,100
"I'm here. Please come here and hear me out."

150
00:11:20,100 --> 00:11:25,040
But you came to me on your own, and you said you needed me.

151
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:26,550
You wanted to have an adventure with me.

152
00:11:26,550 --> 00:11:29,400
I suppose I was very happy about that.

153
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:34,770
So, when you told me to leave, I f-felt... I guess... I f-felt disappointed?

154
00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:43,240
Ms. Seo, you're really...

155
00:11:44,490 --> 00:11:46,680
such a headache.

156
00:11:46,680 --> 00:11:48,100
What?

157
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:52,040
What am I supposed to do if you do this?

 Edit 

200
00:15:31,180 --> 00:15:38,790
 Mr. Lee Jun Ho 

201
00:15:48,140 --> 00:15:54,900
 Daechi Chase opens Huiwon High class 

202
00:16:00,370 --> 00:16:05,280
Director Kim sure is something else.

203
00:16:05,280 --> 00:16:08,090
What are you saying out of the blue?

204
00:16:08,090 --> 00:16:12,640
I was here late last night since I had a night counseling duty.

205
00:16:12,640 --> 00:16:15,250
He called me when I was about to leave.

206
00:16:16,580 --> 00:16:18,350
Did he?

207
00:16:18,350 --> 00:16:22,940
He told me to order a banner and gave me the copy.

208
00:16:22,940 --> 00:16:25,360
And he went out for a drink.

209
00:16:26,500 --> 00:16:29,700
When everyone else is jumping for joy,

210
00:16:29,700 --> 00:16:33,300
he was thinking that in his head.

211
00:16:33,300 --> 00:16:36,570
I found it strangely off-putting.

212
00:16:39,230 --> 00:16:42,210
Being a half step ahead of everyone else ...

213
00:16:42,210 --> 00:16:45,210
that's that guy's speciality!

214
00:16:45,210 --> 00:16:48,590
See how he established this place while other small academies were failing.

215
00:16:48,590 --> 00:16:53,020
Don't underestimate him just because he's mild-mannered.

216
00:16:53,020 --> 00:16:55,980
You'll have to learn from him.

217
00:16:57,440 --> 00:17:01,180
Gosh, it's not something you can learn.

218
00:17:01,180 --> 00:17:04,160
It's all about instinct.

219
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:07,860
An old lady like me can't even imitate him.

220
00:17:08,950 --> 00:17:13,170
I scheduled the Huiwon class for just Wednesday nights for now.

221
00:17:13,170 --> 00:17:18,060
I didn't think a Sunday class would be necessary.

222
00:17:18,770 --> 00:17:21,780
What should I do for Chanyeong High 11th grade class?

223
00:17:22,470 --> 00:17:25,840
Should I give it back to Ms. Seo?

224
00:17:25,840 --> 00:17:28,100
Just leave it for now.

225
00:17:32,230 --> 00:17:35,540
The Director would comfort her, right?

226
00:17:35,540 --> 00:17:37,770
I mean Ms. Seo.

227
00:17:46,280 --> 00:17:48,220
Hey.

228
00:17:48,220 --> 00:17:50,880
- Did you wait long? 
- Not really.

229
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:52,960
I ordered the food already.

230
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:55,740
I got what you usually get.

231
00:17:55,740 --> 00:17:58,530
- Was there such a thing?
 - Of course.

232
00:18:09,350 --> 00:18:10,690
That's for her.

233
00:18:10,690 --> 00:18:14,210
Okay. Here you go.

234
00:18:14,210 --> 00:18:15,970
Thank you.

235
00:18:20,350 --> 00:18:22,480
Okay.

236
00:18:23,290 --> 00:18:24,630
I have a class soon.

237
00:18:24,630 --> 00:18:27,450
You have five hours to go.

238
00:18:27,450 --> 00:18:29,590
That's enough time to drink a glass and get sober.

239
00:18:29,590 --> 00:18:32,110
Let's do it for old-time's sake.

240
00:18:38,370 --> 00:18:43,030
Is it too humble a lunch for a hero?

241
00:18:43,030 --> 00:18:44,870
It's okay.

242
00:18:46,050 --> 00:18:49,790
I wanted to treat you somewhere impressive,

243
00:18:49,790 --> 00:18:51,950
but I remembered this restaurant.

244
00:18:51,950 --> 00:18:56,780
I was in the area for work and noticed they were still open.

245
00:18:59,320 --> 00:19:01,520
You know how we're short on classrooms.

246
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:05,910
So, I was looking for a place for a few small classrooms.

247
00:19:05,910 --> 00:19:09,880
I heard our old academy space was available, so I checked it out.

248
00:19:09,880 --> 00:19:11,540
If so...

249
00:19:12,340 --> 00:19:14,750
I didn't sign the contract because it didn't feel right.

250
00:19:14,750 --> 00:19:18,380
A couple of teachers started dating, apparently.

251
00:19:18,380 --> 00:19:21,220
I guess the academy was negatively affected and had to shut down.

252
00:19:21,220 --> 00:19:24,010
The teachers gossiped among themselves and got jealous.

253
00:19:24,010 --> 00:19:28,970
A nasty rumor spread among students, too.

254
00:19:28,970 --> 00:19:33,300
I heard they couldn't do anything once the students started leaving.

255
00:19:34,510 --> 00:19:40,810
Thinking about it, no one is as spick and span as you are.

256
00:19:40,810 --> 00:19:43,800
Professionally and personally.

257
00:19:47,380 --> 00:19:51,240
I try to be spick and span professionally and personally.

258
00:19:57,910 --> 00:19:59,950
Let's eat.

259
00:20:21,820 --> 00:20:26,370
Is your younger brother still commuting from your parents' house?

260
00:20:26,370 --> 00:20:27,840
Yes.

261
00:20:29,270 --> 00:20:33,700
Sejong Government Complex must be far from there.

262
00:20:33,700 --> 00:20:36,720
He'll save up and get his own place soon.

263
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:39,530
Time goes by so fast.

264
00:20:39,530 --> 00:20:42,040
It feels like yesterday when I paid his tuition.

265
00:20:42,040 --> 00:20:44,660
But he's a civil servant now.

266
00:20:55,410 --> 00:20:59,280
You must've heard everything from Jun Ho last night, right?

267
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:00,850
Of course.

268
00:21:01,560 --> 00:21:06,020
It reminded me of the old days.

269
00:21:06,020 --> 00:21:07,980
I could tell.

270
00:21:07,980 --> 00:21:10,160
Thinking about it,

271
00:21:10,160 --> 00:21:16,630
it looks like Jun Ho has always been at turning points in our lives.

272
00:21:16,630 --> 00:21:18,420
Right.

273
00:21:20,590 --> 00:21:25,570
As I paid off the debt I created while making a film, thanks to you two

274
00:21:25,570 --> 00:21:29,180
and moved out of this building,

275
00:21:29,180 --> 00:21:32,840
I promised myself something.

276
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:40,310
Never fail again, and never torment the people who trusted me again.

277
00:21:40,310 --> 00:21:43,830
That's one's duty as the leader.

278
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:50,400
Since I was afraid to fail,

279
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:54,480
I did something I shouldn't have done to you.

280
00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:57,790
I couldn't sleep thinking about the Gangbuk branch.

281
00:21:57,790 --> 00:22:00,970
A new area, unfamiliar schools,

282
00:22:00,970 --> 00:22:04,640
and the students outside of Daechi-dong.

283
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:08,220
I wondered how we could put our roots down there

284
00:22:08,220 --> 00:22:12,510
and who could achieve that for us.

285
00:22:12,510 --> 00:22:16,760
That's why I started feeling hasty.

286
00:22:16,760 --> 00:22:20,600
I was desperate to give you a major task

287
00:22:21,270 --> 00:22:23,600
that I forgot my initial spirit.

288
00:22:26,690 --> 00:22:30,080
You should get a TA.

289
00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:34,860
This would be independent of the TA you personally hired.

290
00:22:34,860 --> 00:22:39,420
The academy will be paying them instead.

291
00:22:39,420 --> 00:22:43,480
But I don't need one since I have fewer classes now.

292
00:22:44,500 --> 00:22:49,490
I sincerely apologize as the director.

293
00:22:49,490 --> 00:22:52,900
Please teach Chanyeong High's 11th-grade class again.

294
00:22:54,850 --> 00:22:56,320
Cheers.

295
00:22:58,990 --> 00:23:02,100
 I felt so guilty, I thought I'd die. 

296
00:23:02,100 --> 00:23:04,620
- Director.
 - Yes?

297
00:23:04,620 --> 00:23:07,380
That's not how you apologize.

298
00:23:07,380 --> 00:23:09,940
Why are you embarrassing me, too?

299
00:23:11,620 --> 00:23:13,440
Well, you know,

300
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:18,030
if you're embarrassed in front of Mr. Lee and Ms. Nam, don't worry.

301
00:23:18,030 --> 00:23:22,770
Jun Ho needs to be focusing on Huiwon High

302
00:23:22,770 --> 00:23:27,640
and Ms. Nam will be given an appropriate class.

303
00:23:27,640 --> 00:23:34,450
Indeed, you need to keep the Daechi-dong branch steady as a rock

304
00:23:34,450 --> 00:23:39,480
so our academy can grow. I finally realized that now.

305
00:23:39,480 --> 00:23:42,500
I understand you feel disappointed.

306
00:23:42,500 --> 00:23:46,010
I-If my... I'm stuttering now.

307
00:23:46,010 --> 00:23:48,580
If my apology wasn't enough, let me once again—

308
00:23:48,580 --> 00:23:50,310
I'm not saying it wasn't enough.

309
00:23:50,310 --> 00:23:53,090
I'm saying it was wrong.

310
00:23:55,710 --> 00:23:57,470
Am I hard to understand?

311
00:23:57,470 --> 00:24:00,600
I'm known for easily explaining things.

312
00:24:00,600 --> 00:24:04,050
Seriously. Team Leader Seo.

313
00:24:07,100 --> 00:24:08,960
Come on, Seo Hye Jin—

314
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:13,630
You didn't just cancel my Chanyeong class. You broke our trust.

315
00:24:13,630 --> 00:24:17,500
Don't be like that. That's not right. Don't exaggerate.

316
00:24:17,500 --> 00:24:23,830
I know that you and Assistant Director have been nervous for about five years.

317
00:24:30,570 --> 00:24:32,070
Yes.

318
00:24:32,760 --> 00:24:35,140
Yes, this is Seo Hye Jin.

319
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:40,560
Yes.

320
00:24:41,210 --> 00:24:44,260
But how... yes...

321
00:24:44,260 --> 00:24:46,360
How did you get my number?

322
00:24:48,250 --> 00:24:51,790
Yes, I've heard of them.

323
00:24:56,210 --> 00:24:58,290
No, I'm not interested in seeing them.

324
00:24:58,290 --> 00:25:00,670
Even a fool would've noticed.

325
00:25:00,670 --> 00:25:02,180
Whenever I got a call from a different academy,

326
00:25:02,180 --> 00:25:07,440
you brought up our old friendship and loyalty.

327
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:08,950
But it didn't matter to me.

328
00:25:08,950 --> 00:25:11,960
I thought maybe I didn't provide enough trust.

329
00:25:11,960 --> 00:25:15,970
So, I signed your contracts, no matter what they said.

330
00:25:15,970 --> 00:25:19,640
The more I read this clause, the more I hate it.

331
00:25:19,640 --> 00:25:24,820
You can't get a job in the area for a year if you quit your job.

332
00:25:24,820 --> 00:25:26,500
It doesn't happen all the time,

333
00:25:26,500 --> 00:25:29,190
but you might have to compensate them for the loss.

334
00:25:29,190 --> 00:25:30,680
You know that, right?

335
00:25:30,680 --> 00:25:32,240
It doesn't matter since I won't quit.

336
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:35,040
I'll sign if everything else looks fine.

337
00:25:35,720 --> 00:25:39,770
 I never even jaywalked after my face started appearing in ads in Daechi-dong. 

338
00:25:39,770 --> 00:25:42,960
And I never swore so I wouldn't damage the academy's image.

339
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:44,920
- Team Leader Seo.
 - Yes.

340
00:25:44,920 --> 00:25:46,510
It was because I was grateful.

341
00:25:46,510 --> 00:25:49,230
Because you helped me when I was struggling.

342
00:25:49,230 --> 00:25:51,550
But I didn't receive anything for free.

343
00:25:51,550 --> 00:25:54,510
My brother's tuition and my father's hospital bill?

344
00:25:54,510 --> 00:25:57,640
It was an advance. You never gave it to me for free.

345
00:25:57,640 --> 00:26:00,170
Why do you talk as if it were a charity case?

346
00:26:00,170 --> 00:26:03,020
I must've caused a miscommunication.

347
00:26:03,020 --> 00:26:05,320
I was disappointed in you when you docked my pay,

348
00:26:05,320 --> 00:26:09,930
but I thought our relationship was still good enough.

349
00:26:10,790 --> 00:26:13,970
You said Seo Hye Jin is more important than a few students.

350
00:26:13,970 --> 00:26:16,360
I believed it when you said that.

351
00:26:18,650 --> 00:26:21,300
I felt rewarded seeing the academy grow, too.

352
00:26:21,300 --> 00:26:25,050
But you must've thought all of that was yours.

353
00:26:25,050 --> 00:26:27,420
Gosh, seriously.

354
00:26:28,160 --> 00:26:30,690
Don't act all high and mighty.

355
00:26:30,690 --> 00:26:33,120
You wanted to be the youngest director at the Gangbuk branch.

356
00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:34,850
I'm glad you brought that up.

357
00:26:34,850 --> 00:26:36,620
Is the Gangbuk branch mine?

358
00:26:36,620 --> 00:26:38,170
Should I grow it and keep it?

359
00:26:38,170 --> 00:26:39,770
It's because I was scared!

360
00:26:39,770 --> 00:26:41,890
Director Kim Hyeon Tak!

361
00:26:41,890 --> 00:26:44,450
Can't you be more honest?

362
00:26:44,450 --> 00:26:46,430
I'm not lying.

363
00:26:47,720 --> 00:26:50,110
What did you say?

364
00:26:50,110 --> 00:26:52,450
I really was scared.

365
00:26:54,910 --> 00:27:00,240
I have nightmares where you take the entire Chaneyong High with you.

366
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:02,590
You were shoveling my money away, too.

367
00:27:02,590 --> 00:27:05,580
That's my reward for working 15 hours a day without taking weekends off.

368
00:27:05,580 --> 00:27:08,490
How did you end up this way, Director?

369
00:27:08,490 --> 00:27:10,620
Ask a hundred directors on the streets.

370
00:27:10,620 --> 00:27:12,420
Ask them if they're afraid of teachers like you.

371
00:27:12,420 --> 00:27:14,230
I didn't change.

372
00:27:14,230 --> 00:27:15,990
I just became a director.

373
00:27:15,990 --> 00:27:18,010
You said you were different than other directors!

374
00:27:18,010 --> 00:27:20,300
See? You never lose an argument!

375
00:27:20,300 --> 00:27:23,520
Gosh, fight outside!

376
00:27:31,870 --> 00:27:35,280
I wanted us to have a beautiful goodbye someday

377
00:27:36,470 --> 00:27:38,510
if my time to part with you came.

378
00:27:38,510 --> 00:27:41,400
Gosh, I said I-I was sorry.

379
00:27:41,400 --> 00:27:44,020
Why would you say something so awful?

380
00:27:44,020 --> 00:27:47,450
Give the Chanyeong High 11th-grade class to Ms. Nam and Mr. Lee.

381
00:27:47,450 --> 00:27:50,750
They're working hard on it.

382
00:27:51,770 --> 00:27:53,280
Wait...

383
00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:01,340
Darn it.

384
00:28:01,340 --> 00:28:05,940
 Teachers' Office 

385
00:28:05,940 --> 00:28:11,270
 Students are not allowed to enter while the final exams are being taken. 

386
00:28:11,270 --> 00:28:14,390
You teach the 11th grade.

387
00:28:14,390 --> 00:28:19,290
I'm asking why you're involving yourself in the 10th-grade exam.

388
00:28:20,930 --> 00:28:26,060
I've created 10th-grade exams for three years until last year.

389
00:28:26,060 --> 00:28:30,840
You can apply the school's exam trends or overall direction, too.

390
00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:34,990
I assume you didn't do that as a hobby.

391
00:28:34,990 --> 00:28:38,160
You don't even have a 10th-grade class.

392
00:28:38,160 --> 00:28:42,050
The head of the 10th grade requested this.

393
00:28:43,820 --> 00:28:48,290
We'd feel better if you had another look.

394
00:28:50,500 --> 00:28:52,690
- Feel better?
 - I'm not...

395
00:28:52,690 --> 00:28:56,820
I'm not necessarily telling you to use the old exams.

396
00:29:00,510 --> 00:29:02,690
I appreciate the gesture.

397
00:29:08,660 --> 00:29:11,120
He's so stubborn.

398
00:29:14,070 --> 00:29:18,610
I'll take any kind of cigarettes. A lighter, too.

399
00:29:18,610 --> 00:29:21,070
We don't sell cigarettes.

400
00:29:21,990 --> 00:29:24,530
The parents complained about it.

401
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:31,990
 Mr. Pyo is such a troublemaker. 

402
00:29:35,620 --> 00:29:38,110
Okay, then. Get back to work.

403
00:29:38,110 --> 00:29:39,530
Okay.

404
00:30:24,460 --> 00:30:28,280
Can I bum a cigarette from you?

405
00:30:28,280 --> 00:30:32,500
I quit a long time ago.

406
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,300
Okay. Here you go.

407
00:31:35,190 --> 00:31:40,470
 Prepare for school exams and college entrance exam with Daechi Chase 

408
00:31:50,590 --> 00:31:55,120
So Yeong, you finished reading the contract I gave you, right?

409
00:31:57,300 --> 00:31:58,860
We'll be counting on you, then.

410
00:31:58,860 --> 00:32:01,320
Yes. Tell Jae Yeong to stop by sometime.

411
00:32:01,320 --> 00:32:02,530
Thank you in advance.

412
00:32:02,530 --> 00:32:04,240
I'll do my best to teach them.

413
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:06,850
Get home safely.

414
00:32:13,480 --> 00:32:16,010
How come you don't even get nervous?

415
00:32:16,910 --> 00:32:18,920
There's no time for that.

416
00:32:20,420 --> 00:32:22,580
Would you like some tea?

417
00:32:22,580 --> 00:32:23,940
Sure.

418
00:32:26,650 --> 00:32:31,620
The mothers sometimes bring nice teas.

419
00:32:31,620 --> 00:32:35,000
Of course, only when their kids' grades improve.

420
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:37,540
If the grades go down,

421
00:32:38,480 --> 00:32:41,850
they swear instead of gifting teas.

422
00:32:44,120 --> 00:32:47,810
- Thank you.
 - It tastes pretty good.

423
00:32:51,150 --> 00:32:55,800
They have expensive taste since they're mothers who live in Gangnam.

424
00:32:58,100 --> 00:33:02,450
You talk as if you aren't one of them.

425
00:33:02,450 --> 00:33:04,900
My gosh.

426
00:33:05,920 --> 00:33:09,560
By the way, I'm not sure

427
00:33:09,560 --> 00:33:13,140
if I can be so casual with you.

428
00:33:13,140 --> 00:33:17,430
You became the most desired teacher at the academy.

429
00:33:18,200 --> 00:33:19,910
Please, keep it casual.

430
00:33:19,910 --> 00:33:22,590
- Thank you. 
 - Not at all

431
00:33:28,830 --> 00:33:34,180
It's such a cruel world, isn't it?

432
00:33:37,270 --> 00:33:38,870
Well...

433
00:33:39,670 --> 00:33:45,140
I've been working at the academy for five or six years already.

434
00:33:45,140 --> 00:33:49,270
Things are so different than how they seem outside.

435
00:33:49,270 --> 00:33:54,790
The teachers must feel so lonely.

436
00:33:54,790 --> 00:33:58,120
They don't have anyone to rely on

437
00:33:58,120 --> 00:34:00,860
or to trust.

438
00:34:06,670 --> 00:34:13,290
Team Leader Seo is very hurt by this, right?

439
00:34:14,470 --> 00:34:16,210
Yes.

440
00:34:16,210 --> 00:34:20,280
I don't know entirely, but probably quite a bit.

441
00:34:20,280 --> 00:34:22,790
Of course, she is.

442
00:34:22,790 --> 00:34:26,540
When they said they'd give the Chanyeong class to someone else,

443
00:34:26,540 --> 00:34:30,420
even my heart sank.

444
00:34:36,450 --> 00:34:39,800
Will she renew the contract?

445
00:34:42,620 --> 00:34:45,570
I'm not sure. I don't know that much, either.

446
00:34:45,570 --> 00:34:48,370
Should I ask her myself?

447
00:34:48,370 --> 00:34:50,880
No, come on.

448
00:34:50,880 --> 00:34:53,330
I wasn't asking that.

449
00:34:59,940 --> 00:35:07,040
Ms. Seo first joined the academy when she was barely 20.

450
00:35:07,040 --> 00:35:11,450
She was such a baby if you think about it.

451
00:35:12,490 --> 00:35:16,940
When I had a counseling session with her because of your mom's recommendation,

452
00:35:16,940 --> 00:35:20,690
I couldn't even call her "Teacher."

453
00:35:22,010 --> 00:35:23,370
I felt that way, too.

454
00:35:23,370 --> 00:35:25,080
Right?

455
00:35:26,440 --> 00:35:30,650
But how many years has it been?

456
00:35:30,650 --> 00:35:36,180
She's been so devoted to the academy for over a decade.

457
00:35:37,020 --> 00:35:41,880
She's not calculating at all because of that.

458
00:35:41,880 --> 00:35:44,990
She never got to enjoy life, either.

459
00:35:45,790 --> 00:35:47,740
You're right.

460
00:35:47,740 --> 00:35:52,200
Someone like that can get scary

461
00:35:52,200 --> 00:35:55,920
once they change their mind.

462
00:35:58,130 --> 00:36:00,920
Aren't you going to go independent, ma'am?

463
00:36:00,920 --> 00:36:02,290
What?

464
00:36:02,290 --> 00:36:04,070
Seung Gyu told me.

465
00:36:04,070 --> 00:36:09,580
That you're planning to start an academy with a director if your husband approves.

466
00:36:12,490 --> 00:36:14,670
My goodness.

467
00:36:16,840 --> 00:36:21,190
Seriously, this is how sons are.

468
00:36:23,330 --> 00:36:26,410
Why doesn't he understand his mother?

469
00:36:29,210 --> 00:36:34,700
It's not my husband's approval I'm waiting for.

470
00:36:35,590 --> 00:36:38,480
It's a capable director.

471
00:36:42,100 --> 00:36:45,660
It'd have to be a serious talent to satisfy you.

472
00:36:45,660 --> 00:36:47,870
Of course.

473
00:36:47,870 --> 00:36:49,920
They'd have to be...

474
00:36:50,620 --> 00:36:56,510
at least as good as Ms. Seo to satisfy me.

475
00:37:07,030 --> 00:37:09,640
Seo Hye Jin is so popular.

476
00:37:12,930 --> 00:37:15,130
Mr. Lee.

477
00:37:15,130 --> 00:37:16,880
You're a busy man today.

478
00:37:16,880 --> 00:37:18,520
I thought the counseling session ended a while ago.

479
00:37:18,520 --> 00:37:20,620
Where have you been?

480
00:37:20,620 --> 00:37:22,670
- Were you looking for me?
 - Of course.

481
00:37:22,670 --> 00:37:24,570
Do you have time to loaf around?

482
00:37:24,570 --> 00:37:26,520
I wasn't loafing around.

483
00:37:26,520 --> 00:37:28,800
I'll be in the office.

484
00:37:31,090 --> 00:37:32,580
Let's go to the reference room.

485
00:37:32,580 --> 00:37:35,050
We need to create class material for Huiwon High.

486
00:37:35,050 --> 00:37:37,990
I'll create my part myself. Just review it for me.

487
00:37:37,990 --> 00:37:39,690
I know you're busy.

488
00:37:40,280 --> 00:37:42,670
Even if Si Wu brought all of his friends,

489
00:37:42,670 --> 00:37:45,670
we'd barely meet the minimum enrollment requirement.

490
00:37:45,670 --> 00:37:49,410
Student care is critical with small classes. There's still a lot you don't know.

491
00:37:49,410 --> 00:37:52,340
I'll ask you questions if I have any.

492
00:37:59,770 --> 00:38:02,090
I said I could do a good job.

493
00:38:12,160 --> 00:38:13,800
Have a seat.

494
00:38:21,790 --> 00:38:23,480
Jun Ho,

495
00:38:24,750 --> 00:38:27,160
should I share my trade secret with you?

496
00:38:27,780 --> 00:38:31,670
It's okay. You said it'd be unfair for other teachers.

497
00:38:31,670 --> 00:38:34,580
No, you'll find out about it soon, too.

498
00:38:37,830 --> 00:38:40,970
Once you start teaching students,

499
00:38:40,970 --> 00:38:43,370
you'll have a favorite eventually.

500
00:38:43,940 --> 00:38:46,680
Si Wu will be like that to you.

501
00:38:49,540 --> 00:38:52,380
You were my favorite.

502
00:38:52,380 --> 00:38:56,890
Seung Gyu, Ho Jae, and Tae Hyeon were all great,

503
00:38:59,610 --> 00:39:01,700
but I liked you the most.

504
00:39:01,700 --> 00:39:04,220
Don't tell Manager Kim.

505
00:39:04,220 --> 00:39:08,360
It's because my grades improved the most

506
00:39:08,360 --> 00:39:10,480
and I brought a lot of my friends, too.

507
00:39:10,480 --> 00:39:15,480
Yes. I thought that was why, too, but no.

508
00:39:15,480 --> 00:39:20,570
Even if your grades went down and the friends you brought quit,

509
00:39:20,570 --> 00:39:22,570
you...

510
00:39:23,670 --> 00:39:26,050
were very precious as you were.

511
00:39:27,720 --> 00:39:30,780
I guess I wanted to do more for you because of that.

512
00:39:30,780 --> 00:39:33,820
So, I said some silly things yesterday.

513
00:39:33,820 --> 00:39:35,980
I said I was disappointed and stuff.

514
00:39:38,130 --> 00:39:40,560
Forget about things like that.

515
00:39:40,560 --> 00:39:43,820
Forget about feeling grateful, guilty, and disappointed.

516
00:39:43,820 --> 00:39:45,990
Just focus on your goal.

517
00:39:45,990 --> 00:39:49,930
I'll help you as much as I can if you need anything.

518
00:39:55,390 --> 00:40:00,450
I went in front of your house after we parted last night.

519
00:40:38,750 --> 00:40:41,220
There's something you don't know.

520
00:40:42,540 --> 00:40:43,810
What is it?

521
00:40:43,810 --> 00:40:46,840
More than you think,

522
00:40:47,610 --> 00:40:50,300
I'm holding back as hard as I can.

523
00:40:50,300 --> 00:40:52,800
Because if I told you everything I wanted,

524
00:40:53,700 --> 00:40:57,670
you might get sick of me.

525
00:40:58,940 --> 00:41:01,840
So, go while you still can.

526
00:41:08,440 --> 00:41:10,320
The students are coming. Let's go.

527
00:41:10,320 --> 00:41:12,440
Anyway, you need to devote yourself to Huiwon High.

528
00:41:12,440 --> 00:41:16,030
You can work on your part, but make sure I review it.

529
00:41:19,840 --> 00:41:22,000
You read between the lines, right?

530
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:24,040
Open it. Nothing is scarier than rumors.

531
00:41:24,040 --> 00:41:26,120
Let the rumors spread.

532
00:41:34,840 --> 00:41:37,650
Wow, that sounds tasty.

533
00:41:41,420 --> 00:41:42,880
Hello.

534
00:41:42,880 --> 00:41:44,520
Hi.

535
00:41:46,070 --> 00:41:47,570
Hello.

536
00:41:48,230 --> 00:41:50,480
Hello.

537
00:41:50,480 --> 00:41:53,290
Hello.

538
00:42:29,800 --> 00:42:32,430
Free up some time tonight.

539
00:42:32,430 --> 00:42:33,460
Why?

540
00:42:33,460 --> 00:42:34,850
You have to take us out to celebrate Heewon class.

541
00:42:34,850 --> 00:42:37,290
I heard you met the enrollment requirement today.

542
00:42:37,290 --> 00:42:40,580
Wow, I'm excited to finally spend money.

543
00:42:40,580 --> 00:42:43,380
I won't let you say, "I have a plan. I need to do something."

544
00:42:43,380 --> 00:42:45,660
You know what'll happen if you run away, right?

545
00:42:45,660 --> 00:42:47,980
It won't be pretty.

546
00:42:47,980 --> 00:42:50,490
I should remind you I'm the life of the party.

547
00:42:50,490 --> 00:42:52,360
Let's do it.

548
00:43:21,320 --> 00:43:22,470
Director.

549
00:43:22,470 --> 00:43:24,970
Yes, our assistant director.

550
00:43:24,970 --> 00:43:28,030
You couldn't be reached all day.

551
00:43:28,030 --> 00:43:30,150
What happened?

552
00:43:32,690 --> 00:43:35,900
We'll have tomato juice. Two glasses.

553
00:43:35,900 --> 00:43:38,540
No, I'm okay.

554
00:43:38,540 --> 00:43:42,560
I don't want to get sober.

555
00:43:42,560 --> 00:43:46,520
Did your conversation with Ms. Seo not go well?

556
00:43:50,760 --> 00:43:52,130
Assistant Director.

557
00:43:52,130 --> 00:43:54,610
Yes, go ahead.

558
00:43:55,740 --> 00:43:59,620
We should change our strategy.

559
00:44:01,110 --> 00:44:05,430
Seo Hye Jin's head got way too big.

560
00:44:05,430 --> 00:44:09,110
We've been breaking her little by little,

561
00:44:09,110 --> 00:44:14,420
and we're about to lose at least a hundred students.

562
00:44:16,050 --> 00:44:17,660
If so...

563
00:44:20,020 --> 00:44:26,300
I'd like you to back down a bit for now.

564
00:44:29,140 --> 00:44:31,620
Will there be two assistant directors?

565
00:44:31,620 --> 00:44:35,890
Well, the title won't matter.

566
00:44:35,890 --> 00:44:38,450
She can be the head of the faculty.

567
00:44:38,450 --> 00:44:43,550
Anyway, we need to give her everything we can.

568
00:44:44,280 --> 00:44:46,510
Gosh, it's almost time to renew the contract, too.

569
00:44:46,510 --> 00:44:47,800
Director.

570
00:44:47,800 --> 00:44:50,780
I have a bad feeling.

571
00:44:55,450 --> 00:44:59,950
I... need to kneel down and beg.

572
00:45:02,350 --> 00:45:04,730
You don't have to go that far.

573
00:45:11,610 --> 00:45:16,590
I can't imagine the academy without Seo Hye Jin.

574
00:45:19,180 --> 00:45:24,420
You'll drink all the alcohol today, Mr. Lee.

575
00:45:24,420 --> 00:45:27,820
You haven't hung out with us because of the secret project.

576
00:45:27,820 --> 00:45:29,570
Cheers.

577
00:45:30,200 --> 00:45:32,110
I knew it'd work out.

578
00:45:32,110 --> 00:45:33,650
Really?

579
00:45:34,550 --> 00:45:37,350
Hello. Hello.

580
00:45:38,500 --> 00:45:41,960
I've always wanted to talk to you, Ms. Seo.

581
00:45:41,960 --> 00:45:43,810
Oh, really?

582
00:45:47,340 --> 00:45:52,480
Ms. Nam kept telling me how much she enjoyed your class.

583
00:45:52,480 --> 00:45:55,990
I didn't keep saying that. I just said it once.

584
00:45:55,990 --> 00:45:56,980
Cheers.

585
00:45:56,980 --> 00:46:01,170
Why are you all sharing that small table?

586
00:46:01,170 --> 00:46:04,790
Send us either Mr. Lee or Ms. Moneybags. Let's split them up.

587
00:46:04,790 --> 00:46:06,790
Okay. I'll—

588
00:46:06,790 --> 00:46:07,950
Mr. Lee, you should stay.

589
00:46:07,950 --> 00:46:10,200
They drink like crazy. Mr. Lee Jang Wu can't be defeated.

590
00:46:10,200 --> 00:46:13,110
Ms... Team Leader, will you be okay?

591
00:46:13,110 --> 00:46:14,960
No one can beat me.

592
00:46:16,170 --> 00:46:18,100
Here you go.

593
00:46:18,100 --> 00:46:19,940
Hand me these.

594
00:46:19,940 --> 00:46:22,260
Make sure they don't run out of food, either.

595
00:46:22,260 --> 00:46:24,220
We should've done this on the day of the event.

596
00:46:24,220 --> 00:46:26,220
- That was so long ago.
 - I'll take that.

597
00:46:26,220 --> 00:46:28,150
Here's the food.

598
00:46:28,150 --> 00:46:29,560
Huh? What?

599
00:46:29,560 --> 00:46:31,770
 Director Kim 
 Does he know we're hanging out without him?

600
00:46:31,770 --> 00:46:33,740
No way.

601
00:46:34,790 --> 00:46:38,340
Team Leader Seo! Team Leader Seo!

602
00:46:38,340 --> 00:46:39,600
You got a call.

603
00:46:39,600 --> 00:46:42,080
Just leave it. It's too late to answer.

604
00:46:42,080 --> 00:46:44,300
It's the Director.

605
00:46:45,190 --> 00:46:46,900
Excuse me.

606
00:47:07,620 --> 00:47:10,770
Hye Jin! Hye Jin! Hold on.

607
00:47:13,500 --> 00:47:15,050
What is it? What's going on?

608
00:47:15,050 --> 00:47:18,090
I should make sure the Director gets in a taxi.

609
00:47:19,590 --> 00:47:21,790
Go inside. Right, take my card.

610
00:47:21,790 --> 00:47:23,090
No, no. I'll take care of it.

611
00:47:23,090 --> 00:47:25,060
- No, no.
 - No, no, seriously.

612
00:47:25,060 --> 00:47:27,220
I said I'd pay.

613
00:47:29,780 --> 00:47:31,390
Bye.

614
00:47:48,370 --> 00:47:50,730
What? Why did you come out?

615
00:47:51,910 --> 00:47:55,050
You're on your way to see Director Kim.

616
00:47:55,050 --> 00:47:56,450
Yes, how about you?

617
00:47:56,450 --> 00:48:00,360
Well, it's suspicious.

618
00:48:00,360 --> 00:48:03,240
Why see your drunk male boss at this hour?

619
00:48:03,240 --> 00:48:06,470
This is not allowed in normal companies.

620
00:48:07,500 --> 00:48:09,650
What did you tell everyone?

621
00:48:10,450 --> 00:48:12,940
I said exactly what I just said.

622
00:48:14,640 --> 00:48:16,250
Let's go.

623
00:48:22,770 --> 00:48:25,460
The Director apologized to me earlier today,

624
00:48:25,460 --> 00:48:27,520
but I didn't accept it and f***ing flipped out.

625
00:48:27,520 --> 00:48:29,610
That's probably why.

626
00:48:30,510 --> 00:48:32,430
You did what?

627
00:48:33,290 --> 00:48:35,430
F***ing flipped out.

628
00:48:35,430 --> 00:48:38,050
He's making me swear.

629
00:48:42,710 --> 00:48:46,810
I guess you'll be joining Choeseon Korean.

630
00:48:50,120 --> 00:48:53,410
Where are you, Director? I'm here.

631
00:48:56,720 --> 00:48:59,290
Yes, wait a moment. I'm almost there.

632
00:48:59,290 --> 00:49:00,840
Okay.

633
00:49:00,840 --> 00:49:02,880
Why don't you wait here?

634
00:49:02,880 --> 00:49:05,250
No, I'll come with you.

635
00:49:05,250 --> 00:49:06,590
I'll scream if something happens.

636
00:49:06,590 --> 00:49:08,770
He's right there.

637
00:49:09,790 --> 00:49:11,630
How do I get there, by the way?

638
00:49:11,630 --> 00:49:13,240
Here it is.

639
00:49:16,350 --> 00:49:18,100
Ms. Seo...

640
00:49:18,100 --> 00:49:20,300
- It's okay.
 - Be careful.

641
00:49:33,750 --> 00:49:35,560
Director.

642
00:49:39,510 --> 00:49:42,460
Wow, Seo Hye Jin.

643
00:49:42,460 --> 00:49:46,750
My treasure, Hye Jin.

644
00:49:46,750 --> 00:49:49,060
Gosh, why did you drink so much?

645
00:49:49,060 --> 00:49:51,040
Did you start drinking in the afternoon?

646
00:49:51,040 --> 00:49:52,750
I did.

647
00:49:52,750 --> 00:49:56,110
I smoked a cigarette for a change, too.

648
00:49:57,090 --> 00:49:59,290
Should I get you some water?

649
00:49:59,290 --> 00:50:01,390
I don't need it.

650
00:50:04,480 --> 00:50:08,550
The air is cold. Let's get up.

651
00:50:08,550 --> 00:50:11,130
I'm a coward.

652
00:50:11,720 --> 00:50:14,030
Go home for now. Let's talk tomorrow.

653
00:50:14,030 --> 00:50:16,800
And I'm underhanded.

654
00:50:16,800 --> 00:50:19,830
- I didn't say you were underhanded.
 - Really?

655
00:50:19,830 --> 00:50:25,730
Am I a scoundrel who tries to be clever, then?

656
00:50:25,730 --> 00:50:27,830
Stop blaming yourself.

657
00:50:27,830 --> 00:50:33,540
Today, I just wanted a sincere apology for my longtime devotion. Seriously.

658
00:50:33,540 --> 00:50:36,760
That's right. Apology.

659
00:50:36,760 --> 00:50:39,930
That was the topic of the day.

660
00:50:39,930 --> 00:50:42,630
Gosh, seriously...

661
00:50:46,730 --> 00:50:50,250
Stop acting like I'm pathetic!

662
00:50:52,080 --> 00:50:54,480
Director, I'll go.

663
00:50:54,480 --> 00:50:56,700
No, no, no...

664
00:50:56,700 --> 00:50:59,110
Have a seat. Have a seat here.

665
00:50:59,110 --> 00:51:00,740
Just sit.

666
00:51:00,740 --> 00:51:01,980
Director, be careful.

667
00:51:01,980 --> 00:51:05,570
- Hold on.
 - The apology...

668
00:51:06,910 --> 00:51:14,960
Let me apologize to you sincerely from the bottom of my heart before you go.

669
00:51:14,960 --> 00:51:17,000
Okay?

670
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:19,610
Stay there.

671
00:51:19,610 --> 00:51:22,980
Director! Seriously!

672
00:51:22,980 --> 00:51:26,480
It's okay. Sit down.

673
00:51:28,570 --> 00:51:32,050
Sit! Sit!

674
00:51:32,050 --> 00:51:35,260
- Wow.
 - Have a seat.

675
00:51:35,260 --> 00:51:38,150
Have a seat. Come on.

676
00:51:38,150 --> 00:51:39,910
Sit there.

677
00:52:00,190 --> 00:52:03,080
Team Leader Seo Hye Jin.

678
00:52:03,810 --> 00:52:08,300
I sincerely apologize to you.

679
00:52:09,500 --> 00:52:11,080
Director, get up first.

680
00:52:11,080 --> 00:52:13,790
Let's have a rational conversation, okay?

681
00:52:13,790 --> 00:52:16,250
Please.

682
00:52:16,250 --> 00:52:18,690
Please!

683
00:52:19,270 --> 00:52:21,370
Please don't...

684
00:52:22,070 --> 00:52:25,820
abandon me and the academy.

685
00:52:26,490 --> 00:52:29,800
Get up. Get up, please!

686
00:52:29,800 --> 00:52:34,460
I won't get up until you promise me.

687
00:52:34,460 --> 00:52:36,130
Let's talk tomorrow.

688
00:52:36,130 --> 00:52:38,970
Come here first. Come this way.

689
00:52:38,970 --> 00:52:40,230
Come here!

690
00:52:40,230 --> 00:52:42,540
Ms. Seo! Ms. Seo!

691
00:52:42,540 --> 00:52:44,150
No, no...

692
00:52:45,420 --> 00:52:48,530
It's dangerous. Come here.

693
00:52:48,530 --> 00:52:50,380
What?

694
00:52:50,380 --> 00:52:51,850
- Hello.
 - Huh?

695
00:52:51,850 --> 00:52:55,410
Hey, Lee Jun Ho. What are you doing here?

696
00:52:55,410 --> 00:52:57,010
I know.

697
00:52:58,650 --> 00:53:01,490
Get up first. Get up.

698
00:53:01,490 --> 00:53:03,670
No, let go!

699
00:53:03,670 --> 00:53:08,040
I won't get up until I resolve things properly with Seo Hye Jin.

700
00:53:08,040 --> 00:53:11,410
Resolve things somewhere safer, then.

701
00:53:11,410 --> 00:53:15,460
I said I won't leave!

702
00:53:23,050 --> 00:53:25,640
Looks like they won't come back.

703
00:53:25,640 --> 00:53:29,190
He must've thought of Seo Hye Jin while eating something tasty.

704
00:53:29,190 --> 00:53:31,400
Kim Hyeon Tak is always like that.

705
00:53:32,220 --> 00:53:34,380
Don't be a sissy.

706
00:53:34,380 --> 00:53:37,010
What? This happens all the time.

707
00:53:37,010 --> 00:53:41,420
I'd carry her on my back if I were the director.

708
00:53:41,420 --> 00:53:47,360
Don't be jealous that he's treating her to an expensive drink and meal.

709
00:53:47,360 --> 00:53:49,190
Geez.

710
00:53:55,250 --> 00:54:00,310
Director, please get up now. You must be tired.

711
00:54:00,310 --> 00:54:03,020
I said I don't want to.

712
00:54:04,700 --> 00:54:08,280
What if Ms. Seo catches a cold?

713
00:54:10,630 --> 00:54:12,080
She can't.

714
00:54:12,080 --> 00:54:15,610
No, she can't. So...

715
00:54:15,610 --> 00:54:17,670
Hold onto me.

716
00:54:17,670 --> 00:54:21,460
One, two, three! Be careful.

717
00:54:26,310 --> 00:54:28,110
Director!

718
00:54:28,810 --> 00:54:31,150
What's going on? What do I do?

719
00:54:31,150 --> 00:54:33,570
What's going on?

720
00:54:33,570 --> 00:54:35,580
What's this?

721
00:54:38,250 --> 00:54:39,980
Are you okay?

722
00:54:44,850 --> 00:54:47,740
Be careful. Be careful. Hold me tightly!

723
00:54:47,740 --> 00:54:49,990
B-Be careful...

724
00:54:49,990 --> 00:54:52,450
Shit!

725
00:54:52,450 --> 00:54:54,730
Geez.

726
00:55:21,690 --> 00:55:24,690
Be careful. Be careful.

727
00:55:25,920 --> 00:55:28,060
Hello.

728
00:55:28,060 --> 00:55:30,200
Watch your legs. Watch your legs.

729
00:55:30,200 --> 00:55:32,820
Gosh, what's this now?

730
00:55:38,120 --> 00:55:41,420
I'm sorry. Please help him.

731
00:55:41,420 --> 00:55:43,240
Okay.

732
00:55:43,240 --> 00:55:44,610
Thank you.

733
00:55:44,610 --> 00:55:48,840
I'm sorry. Please turn up the heater. I'm sorry.

734
00:55:48,840 --> 00:55:52,530
Mr. Lee, go home now.

735
00:55:52,530 --> 00:55:56,110
Don't worry. Get home safely.

736
00:55:58,080 --> 00:55:59,860
Take care.

737
00:56:08,390 --> 00:56:10,960
My gosh. You must be cold.

738
00:56:10,960 --> 00:56:12,930
No, I'm okay. I'm okay.

739
00:56:12,930 --> 00:56:14,760
- Do you want this—
 - No, no.

740
00:56:14,760 --> 00:56:16,730
I swear I'm okay.

741
00:56:16,730 --> 00:56:18,540
I'm okay.

742
00:56:24,280 --> 00:56:26,560
 Confirmed. 

743
00:56:28,130 --> 00:56:31,090
Go to the teachers' office. I'll get you the heater from the storage.

744
00:56:31,090 --> 00:56:33,500
There's a blanket on my desk. Use that.

745
00:56:33,500 --> 00:56:35,550
Take your time. Take your time.

746
00:56:35,550 --> 00:56:37,310
It's too dark.

747
00:57:54,010 --> 00:57:56,110
I told you to use the blanket.

748
00:57:56,110 --> 00:57:59,570
My clothes are all wet. That won't do anything.

749
00:57:59,570 --> 00:58:01,520
Gosh, what do I do?

750
00:58:02,120 --> 00:58:03,340
- Hold on.
 - No, no—

751
00:58:03,340 --> 00:58:05,900
You'll get this wet.

752
00:58:05,900 --> 00:58:08,510
- No, put it on.
 - It's okay. It's okay.

753
00:58:08,510 --> 00:58:10,640
Stay here, then. I'll get another heater. Wait.

754
00:58:10,640 --> 00:58:12,860
I'm really okay. I'm really okay.

755
00:58:12,860 --> 00:58:14,180
Your hand is ice cold.

756
00:58:14,180 --> 00:58:16,850
Wait here. I'll get you something warm.

757
00:58:49,160 --> 00:58:51,060
Hold this.

758
00:58:51,060 --> 00:58:52,380
Okay.

759
00:59:02,350 --> 00:59:04,670
Are you still very cold?

760
00:59:04,670 --> 00:59:06,680
I'm feeling better.

761
00:59:08,150 --> 00:59:10,660
Seriously...

762
00:59:12,370 --> 00:59:14,290
Wh-Why are you laughing?

763
00:59:18,050 --> 00:59:19,700
Seriously...

764
00:59:21,030 --> 00:59:25,700
I didn't think I'd see two adult men falling in the water.

765
00:59:25,700 --> 00:59:29,100
My exam predictions are all wrong.

766
00:59:30,660 --> 00:59:32,540
What does that mean?

767
00:59:34,830 --> 00:59:36,170
Huh?

768
00:59:38,700 --> 00:59:43,950
For about 10 years, my life has had no surprises.

769
00:59:43,950 --> 00:59:48,280
The only thing was my students graduating

770
00:59:48,280 --> 00:59:51,490
and new students coming in each year.

771
00:59:51,490 --> 00:59:54,870
And the change in my bank account balance, maybe.

772
00:59:54,870 --> 00:59:59,130
But since you joined us, something happens every day.

773
00:59:59,130 --> 01:00:02,730
Things I've never experienced have been happening.

774
01:00:02,730 --> 01:00:06,950
As you mentioned, I gave up on the ad modeling gig,

775
01:00:06,950 --> 01:00:09,580
and I've been giving you secret lessons, too.

776
01:00:09,580 --> 01:00:13,350
I gave a free lecture, which no experienced lecturers do.

777
01:00:14,260 --> 01:00:17,280
And I experienced a major failure for the first time.

778
01:00:18,610 --> 01:00:21,430
And you were in a time machine briefly, too.

779
01:00:21,430 --> 01:00:23,490
You saw the young Lee Jun Ho, too.

780
01:00:23,490 --> 01:00:25,140
Yes.

781
01:00:28,480 --> 01:00:30,910
Did you not like that, by chance?

782
01:00:32,910 --> 01:00:35,500
It's not that I disliked it, but...

783
01:00:36,920 --> 01:00:38,990
it felt a bit unfamiliar.

784
01:00:38,990 --> 01:00:41,180
You weren't scared?

785
01:00:45,980 --> 01:00:48,290
Maybe I was.

786
01:00:49,290 --> 01:00:51,770
I don't like it when things are unpredictable.

787
01:00:51,770 --> 01:00:54,940
It's the same with exam questions, life,

788
01:00:55,550 --> 01:00:57,370
or relationships.

789
01:01:02,190 --> 01:01:03,960
Your hands aren't shaking anymore. Hold this.

790
01:01:03,960 --> 01:01:05,430
I'll wait outside.

791
01:01:05,430 --> 01:01:08,340
Take your clothes off and put them there. I'll dry them.

792
01:01:10,350 --> 01:01:13,060
Can I tell you a secret?

793
01:01:13,060 --> 01:01:14,560
A secret?

794
01:01:17,250 --> 01:01:21,160
I've never respected Director Kim.

795
01:01:21,160 --> 01:01:22,330
I can understand that.

796
01:01:22,330 --> 01:01:23,910
But...

797
01:01:25,320 --> 01:01:29,430
I respected him today. Although it was just a tiny bit.

798
01:01:29,430 --> 01:01:32,080
Even though he got you into this mess?

799
01:01:32,080 --> 01:01:35,080
I didn't think he'd kneel down.

800
01:01:35,980 --> 01:01:41,110
I thought he'd make ridiculous excuses like last time, but, really...

801
01:01:41,790 --> 01:01:43,970
It was a shock.

802
01:01:45,630 --> 01:01:47,870
I thought, "You have to do that much

803
01:01:48,640 --> 01:01:51,930
to get what you want."

804
01:01:51,930 --> 01:01:54,890
Yes, he can be slimy

805
01:01:54,890 --> 01:01:57,690
and cunning sometimes.

806
01:01:57,690 --> 01:02:02,350
He acts like a child sometimes, as he did today.

807
01:02:02,350 --> 01:02:05,580
What kind of child drinks like he did?

808
01:02:05,580 --> 01:02:07,300
You're right.

809
01:02:17,940 --> 01:02:19,490
Ms. Seo,

810
01:02:21,290 --> 01:02:24,080
do you want to go back to the old days?

811
01:02:25,090 --> 01:02:27,010
Before I came here.

812
01:02:27,010 --> 01:02:29,690
Back when everything was predictable?

813
01:02:34,680 --> 01:02:35,950
That's the plan.

814
01:02:35,950 --> 01:02:39,240
I'm not asking about your plan. I'm asking how you feel.

815
01:02:40,120 --> 01:02:49,060


816
01:02:51,450 --> 01:02:54,700
I promised I wouldn't hold you back.

817
01:02:54,700 --> 01:02:57,880
It's ridiculous for me to say this,

818
01:02:57,880 --> 01:03:01,090
but Director Kim gave me courage.

819
01:03:01,090 --> 01:03:04,390
Either by kneeling down or embarrassing myself,

820
01:03:04,390 --> 01:03:06,570
I need to say what I need to say.

821
01:03:10,090 --> 01:03:14,330
You said you'd get me anything I want or need.

822
01:03:16,620 --> 01:03:19,020
I need you, Ms. Seo.

823
01:03:21,720 --> 01:03:23,420
You said to leave while you were letting me go.

824
01:03:23,420 --> 01:03:26,090
I'm not talking about Choeseon Korean.

825
01:03:32,930 --> 01:03:38,620
Tell me now if you want to go back to before I came here.

826
01:03:38,620 --> 01:03:41,460
I'll try my best to restrain myself once more.

827
01:03:55,730 --> 01:03:58,690
If you aren't asking what my plan is,

828
01:04:09,730 --> 01:04:12,260
I don't really want to go back.

829
01:04:24,290 --> 01:04:26,240
You knew, right?

830
01:04:28,750 --> 01:04:30,690
Knew what?

831
01:04:30,690 --> 01:04:32,940
How you really feel.

832
01:04:35,620 --> 01:04:37,640
And how I feel, too.

833
01:04:41,020 --> 01:04:44,500
No matter how much I think about it, there's no way you didn't notice ...

834
01:04:47,090 --> 01:04:49,590
that Lee Jun Ho's first love was

835
01:04:50,780 --> 01:04:52,790
Seo Hye Jin.

836
01:04:55,710 --> 01:04:57,320
What are you talking about?

837
01:04:57,320 --> 01:04:59,070
And...

838
01:05:00,110 --> 01:05:03,570
I can no longer just dismiss it as first love.

839
01:05:08,540 --> 01:05:13,010
My feelings keep spilling over because they keep growing.

840
01:05:15,430 --> 01:05:20,450
♫  Love was my greatest teacher  ♫

841
01:05:20,450 --> 01:05:24,030
♫  I knew it then  ♫

842
01:05:27,010 --> 01:05:31,000
♫  I know it now  ♫

843
01:05:31,000 --> 01:05:35,210
♫  For once in my life  ♫

844
01:05:35,210 --> 01:05:42,290
♫  I think I'm finally going to make it right  ♫

845
01:05:42,290 --> 01:05:50,800
♫  Years ago I let you pass me by,  but now's our time  ♫

846
01:05:50,800 --> 01:06:01,500
♫  You walked in my door, and the love I had for you before  ♫

847
01:06:01,500 --> 01:06:09,670
♫  Came shining through just like a star above the cloud  ♫

848
01:06:09,670 --> 01:06:20,440
♫  I knew it then, I know it now  ♫

849
01:06:24,530 --> 01:06:29,660
♫  It's in your eyes as they move  ♫

850
01:06:31,100 --> 01:06:37,530
♫  It's how you call my name out loud  ♫

851
01:06:37,530 --> 01:06:42,660
♫  There's some kind of music in you  ♫

852
01:06:42,660 --> 01:06:46,560
♫  I knew it then  ♫

853
01:06:49,410 --> 01:06:53,490
 The Midnight Romance in Hagwon 

854
01:06:53,490 --> 01:06:55,030
 I just told you how I feel. 

855
01:06:55,030 --> 01:06:57,390
 - You're crazy.
 - I like you. 

856
01:06:57,390 --> 01:06:59,020
 Please think of me as a man. 

857
01:06:59,020 --> 01:07:00,240
 - By chance, is this—
 - No. 

858
01:07:00,240 --> 01:07:03,320
 Breaking news. Seo Hye Jin might quit. 

859
01:07:03,320 --> 01:07:06,200
 She can't refuse. The conditions are perfect. 

860
01:07:06,200 --> 01:07:08,140
 I won't tell anyone what I saw today. 

861
01:07:08,140 --> 01:07:11,930
 You can't get everything you want by bringing up first love. 

862
01:07:11,930 --> 01:07:14,500
 Just remember that I like you. 

863
01:07:14,500 --> 01:07:17,180
 All I can see is Seo Hye Jin. 

864
01:07:17,180 --> 01:07:19,180
 You're so cheeky. 

865
01:07:19,180 --> 01:07:22,380
 I do almost everything I set my mind to. You know, right? 

866
01:07:23,720 --> 01:07:27,290
♫  Came shining through just like a star  ♫
