 The Midnight Romance in Hagwon 

13
00:00:44,450 --> 00:00:46,150
 Episode 13 

14
00:00:46,150 --> 00:00:48,540
I understand your position.

15
00:00:49,140 --> 00:00:51,680
Let's hear the reason.

16
00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:54,540
Now

17
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:02,260
this is not my treasure.

18
00:01:02,260 --> 00:01:06,330
Isn't...  this your treasure?

19
00:01:06,330 --> 00:01:09,060
No, not anymore.

20
00:01:10,650 --> 00:01:13,030
I realized many things observing you two.

21
00:01:13,030 --> 00:01:15,320
You aren't satisfied with where you are

22
00:01:15,320 --> 00:01:17,320
and you chase your dreams and ambitions.

23
00:01:17,320 --> 00:01:19,410
That was impressive.

24
00:01:19,410 --> 00:01:21,760
- So?
 - I should grow, too.

25
00:01:21,760 --> 00:01:24,970
I want to teach without relying on these files.

26
00:01:27,350 --> 00:01:30,430
You want to try something new? Gosh...

27
00:01:30,430 --> 00:01:34,390
You aren't that young, Team Leader Seo.

28
00:01:34,390 --> 00:01:36,890
Isn't that also true for you, too?

29
00:01:40,170 --> 00:01:43,200
Well, so...

30
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:46,290
we probably won't have a meeting like this again.

31
00:01:46,290 --> 00:01:49,120
Let's get things off our chests.

32
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:54,230
I want to nurture students who are capable of studying properly in college.

33
00:01:54,230 --> 00:01:56,430
Our job isn't about nurturing abilities.

34
00:01:56,430 --> 00:01:58,500
We improve scores.

35
00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:01,930
I will try to work on both abilities and scores.

36
00:02:01,930 --> 00:02:04,450
Although I can't do that working for either of you.

37
00:02:06,110 --> 00:02:07,860
I...

38
00:02:08,740 --> 00:02:12,260
guess I really liked you, Ms. Seo.

39
00:02:12,260 --> 00:02:16,480
I'm sorry I kept obsessing without moving on.

40
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:18,330
I didn't deserve your enthusiasm.

41
00:02:18,330 --> 00:02:24,070
But unfortunately, I'm starting to feel responsible now.

42
00:02:25,450 --> 00:02:31,620
There's something sad about the academy teachers who started out young.

43
00:02:31,620 --> 00:02:37,810
Their perspectives are limited, and they can't plan their lives in the long run.

44
00:02:37,810 --> 00:02:41,760
It happens if you've been treated like a king by young students for a long time.

45
00:02:42,710 --> 00:02:44,830
You don't have to feel responsible.

46
00:02:44,830 --> 00:02:46,310
I can manage myself.

47
00:02:46,310 --> 00:02:48,420
It's just that it's a pity.

48
00:02:48,420 --> 00:02:52,780
You could grow so much more.

49
00:02:52,780 --> 00:02:56,720
The files, that used to be my everything, were stolen from me.

50
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:59,750
I lost a good senior and competitor, too.

51
00:02:59,750 --> 00:03:03,790
I'm the most disappointed one right now.

52
00:03:07,970 --> 00:03:10,960
Gosh, how frustrating.

53
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:13,730
What I'm saying is,

54
00:03:13,730 --> 00:03:20,570
you let go of the opportunity to have all three just now.

55
00:03:21,270 --> 00:03:25,150
Since you're having a love affair with your old student.

56
00:03:28,380 --> 00:03:30,960
Are you struggling to understand what I'm saying?

57
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:36,140
I'm asking if you would've made that decision if it were not for Mr. Lee.

58
00:03:39,590 --> 00:03:45,140
Well, you don't have to answer if you don't want to.

59
00:03:45,140 --> 00:03:49,850
You must've thought it'd be game over if you gave up on these files.

60
00:03:49,850 --> 00:03:52,120
But it's just getting started.

61
00:03:54,750 --> 00:04:01,010
I enjoyed hearing about your impressive educational philosophy.

62
00:04:01,010 --> 00:04:04,100
You'll get busy for various reasons going forward.

63
00:04:04,100 --> 00:04:05,570
Thank you for your concern.

64
00:04:05,570 --> 00:04:10,830
Don't forget how I feel about you, no matter how busy you get.

65
00:04:11,450 --> 00:04:16,580
I wanted to bring you to my side as undamaged as possible.

66
00:04:20,340 --> 00:04:21,920
I will bring out the food.

67
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:23,320
Okay.

68
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:25,650
I'll still enjoy the meal.

69
00:04:25,650 --> 00:04:28,550
Feel free to visit if anything happens.

70
00:04:28,550 --> 00:04:31,410
That's what older friends are good for.

71
00:04:38,980 --> 00:04:48,020


72
00:05:18,610 --> 00:05:20,800
I'm sure some of you are like this.

73
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:24,450
"It's so hard to relate to literature.

74
00:05:24,450 --> 00:05:26,490
I think I'm meant to study natural sciences."

75
00:05:27,190 --> 00:05:32,780
But they cried their eyes out when Iron Man died.

76
00:05:34,540 --> 00:05:39,630
I won't let you say cowardly stuff like that anymore.

77
00:05:39,630 --> 00:05:43,120
Being able to cry and laugh watching movies and dramas

78
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:47,540
means that you can cry reading Kim So Wol's poems, too.

79
00:05:47,540 --> 00:05:54,210
And I'll make sure your tears will lead to scores.

80
00:05:55,400 --> 00:06:03,080
Let's focus on the things that pass by the light and sound now.

81
00:06:06,890 --> 00:06:08,290
Hello.

82
00:06:08,290 --> 00:06:10,310
Hello.

83
00:06:11,030 --> 00:06:13,760
Mr. Lee is doing something interesting.

84
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:16,820
Yes, I noticed that coming in, too.

85
00:06:16,820 --> 00:06:20,360
I'm not sure if it's interesting, but how does he have that class?

86
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:22,290
It doesn't meet the class size requirement.

87
00:06:22,290 --> 00:06:25,100
He got rejected at first, but he got it on his second try.

88
00:06:25,100 --> 00:06:28,370
That's even weirder. The academy has policies.

89
00:06:28,370 --> 00:06:31,720
I would've had an English debate class if things worked like that.

90
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:36,620
The social studies department would also grow if they allowed small groups.

91
00:06:36,620 --> 00:06:39,760
I will no longer be the only team leader, too.

92
00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:42,570
Mr. Lee used to work for a corporation.

93
00:06:42,570 --> 00:06:44,560
Maybe he wrote a good proposal.

94
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:48,740
It's not the proposal. He must've used Seo Hye Jin well.

95
00:06:48,740 --> 00:06:52,220
We get scolded about enrollment all the time.

96
00:06:52,220 --> 00:06:54,880
It's suspicious that he has that small of a class.

97
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:56,840
He couldn't have done that himself.

98
00:06:56,840 --> 00:06:58,600
He's just a junior who joined recently.

99
00:06:58,600 --> 00:06:59,700
Is that right?

100
00:06:59,700 --> 00:07:02,140
Team Leader Seo wouldn't do that.

101
00:07:02,140 --> 00:07:04,330
Right. I don't think so, either.

102
00:07:04,330 --> 00:07:07,500
She was against it more than anyone.

103
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:09,740
They had a serious fight.

104
00:07:09,740 --> 00:07:12,440
Is Team Leader Seo not here yet?

105
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:15,160
No. She has an evening class today.

106
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:18,940
Don't worry about what they say.

107
00:07:18,940 --> 00:07:20,400
Okay.

108
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:49,990
More than anything, Team Leader Seo and Mr. Lee aren't getting along these days

109
00:07:49,990 --> 00:07:52,790
since they had a huge fight in the library.

110
00:07:57,030 --> 00:08:00,610
 Meet me after the class at Night Flight. 

111
00:08:00,610 --> 00:08:04,630
Memorizing if it's in the first person or third person point of view isn't important.

112
00:08:04,630 --> 00:08:09,180
Understanding the author's perspective is important.

113
00:08:09,180 --> 00:08:11,570
Don't take notes. Look up at me.

114
00:08:14,660 --> 00:08:17,630
 You know Lee Si Wu, right? From Huiwon High. 

115
00:08:19,140 --> 00:08:20,820
You found out through him?

116
00:08:20,820 --> 00:08:22,810
Their relationship we didn't even know about?

117
00:08:22,810 --> 00:08:27,670
My TA was tricked by that kid once.

118
00:08:27,670 --> 00:08:29,340
 Get out. 

119
00:08:30,060 --> 00:08:33,080
 Get out of my face forever! 

120
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:37,520
The TA drank alone that night because he was upset.

121
00:08:37,520 --> 00:08:40,550
And it happened to be at Seo Hye Jin's regular spot.

122
00:08:40,550 --> 00:08:42,790
Sir?

123
00:08:42,790 --> 00:08:45,720
I'm sorry, but we're closing.

124
00:08:48,050 --> 00:08:49,530
Okay...

125
00:08:50,830 --> 00:08:53,520
Honey, I'm leaving now.

126
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:58,300
Make Hye Jin throw up if she's really sick.

127
00:08:59,470 --> 00:09:01,930
Why would you call Mr. Lee?

128
00:09:01,930 --> 00:09:03,290
Yeah.

129
00:09:03,290 --> 00:09:06,420
Dreamy couple? What are you talking about?

130
00:09:07,020 --> 00:09:12,020
 Yeah. Come on, why would you...  
  

131
00:09:12,020 --> 00:09:16,570
After that, there was no need to look into it further.

132
00:09:16,570 --> 00:09:19,800
I can see why you didn't notice it.

133
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:23,140
They don't even touch each other in Daechi-dong.

134
00:09:23,140 --> 00:09:25,990
And they have a tight teacher-student bond.

135
00:09:25,990 --> 00:09:29,390
That must've prevented you from seeing it

136
00:09:29,390 --> 00:09:33,440
Since it justified their being together all the time.

137
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:36,930
When I met you in the apartment, I said...

138
00:09:36,930 --> 00:09:39,340
Seo Hye Jin isn't the same anymore. Do you remember?

139
00:09:39,340 --> 00:09:40,920
Of course.

140
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:42,850
Did you already know then?

141
00:09:42,850 --> 00:09:46,480
There's another person who knows.

142
00:09:47,100 --> 00:09:49,810
It's Ms. Nam Cheong Mi at your academy.

143
00:09:49,810 --> 00:09:52,600
She seemed pretty useful.

144
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:57,020
She can keep a secret since the rumor hasn't spread yet.

145
00:09:59,570 --> 00:10:02,190
Should we go somewhere else?

146
00:10:02,190 --> 00:10:06,680
We need to find a way to make use of this situation.

147
00:10:06,680 --> 00:10:09,870
 Closed 

148
00:10:20,520 --> 00:10:24,850
 You must've thought it'd be game over if you gave up on these files. 

149
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:27,790
 But it's just getting started. 

150
00:10:48,370 --> 00:10:50,200
Yes, Team Leader Seo.

151
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:53,250
Yes, I'm having an important meeting outside.

152
00:10:53,250 --> 00:10:55,530
Yes, please text me instead.

153
00:11:06,770 --> 00:11:13,140
Director, this year will be like springtime for your dried-up tree.

154
00:11:13,140 --> 00:11:17,340
The tree that was soaked in spring rain is sprouting.

155
00:11:17,340 --> 00:11:19,850
It's not looking too bad.

156
00:11:20,700 --> 00:11:23,040
Since you have a lucky person near you,

157
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:27,880
they'll change any misfortune to fortune as well.

158
00:11:28,520 --> 00:11:31,500
That's why I wanted to hire a new teacher,

159
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:33,520
because I thought he was my lucky person.

160
00:11:33,520 --> 00:11:35,160
Who is it?

161
00:11:35,160 --> 00:11:39,090
The one... who was in 1977, the year of the snake.

162
00:11:39,090 --> 00:11:40,900
The male school teacher.

163
00:11:40,900 --> 00:11:42,610
Yes.

164
00:11:42,610 --> 00:11:44,000
But it didn't work out.

165
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,500
I thought he was my lucky person.

166
00:11:49,210 --> 00:11:53,080
He can't be if you can't make a connection.

167
00:11:54,260 --> 00:11:58,180
In your fortune...

168
00:12:00,170 --> 00:12:02,780
There's no tree in your fortune.

169
00:12:02,780 --> 00:12:04,890
In the months of water,

170
00:12:04,890 --> 00:12:08,580
you might face serious trouble.

171
00:12:09,780 --> 00:12:13,210
You have to beware of water next month.

172
00:12:13,210 --> 00:12:15,610
I should beware of water, of course.

173
00:12:21,940 --> 00:12:24,870
 Assistant Director Wu will quit soon. 

174
00:12:24,870 --> 00:12:26,710
 She'll take the teachers with her, too. 

175
00:12:26,710 --> 00:12:30,210
 Hiring a few teachers fast won't fix this. 

176
00:12:30,210 --> 00:12:32,930
 I'll tell you the details in person. 

177
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:11,120
Here.

178
00:13:17,100 --> 00:13:21,670
It feels like a different place during the day.

179
00:13:21,670 --> 00:13:23,170
It's different, right?

180
00:13:23,170 --> 00:13:25,030
Yes.

181
00:13:25,030 --> 00:13:29,020
But can we come here when the owner isn't here?

182
00:13:29,020 --> 00:13:30,670
I asked the owner.

183
00:13:30,670 --> 00:13:32,940
Because I wanted to talk to you privately.

184
00:13:32,940 --> 00:13:34,610
Just the two of us?

185
00:13:34,610 --> 00:13:37,710
Did something go wrong with meeting the scary ladies?

186
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:43,880
How did your first class go? Did it go well?

187
00:13:43,880 --> 00:13:45,960
Yes.

188
00:13:45,960 --> 00:13:47,410
How was it received?

189
00:13:47,410 --> 00:13:50,970
Well... they said it felt new,

190
00:13:50,970 --> 00:13:52,810
but it was fun.

191
00:13:53,980 --> 00:13:55,760
What a relief.

192
00:14:02,330 --> 00:14:04,340
What? What's wrong?

193
00:14:06,180 --> 00:14:09,180
Huh?I'm really worried.

194
00:14:09,180 --> 00:14:12,510
D-Did something happen?

195
00:14:12,510 --> 00:14:14,390
Jun Ho.

196
00:14:14,390 --> 00:14:16,830
Yes, tell me.

197
00:14:22,430 --> 00:14:24,520
We got caught.

198
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:35,720
Director Choi and... Assistant Director Wu... know

199
00:14:37,550 --> 00:14:39,330
about us.

200
00:14:49,790 --> 00:14:52,010
I feel awkward since the owner isn't here.

201
00:14:52,010 --> 00:14:54,350
But getting water should be okay, right?

202
00:15:31,350 --> 00:15:34,950
I came up with a concept on the way here.

203
00:15:34,950 --> 00:15:38,810
How's "Housemistress B and Love Letters?"

204
00:15:38,810 --> 00:15:42,480
I'm a Korean teacher, you know.

205
00:15:43,280 --> 00:15:46,340
A female teacher who never had a proper relationship

206
00:15:46,340 --> 00:15:49,340
went crazy over her young student?

207
00:15:49,340 --> 00:15:52,640
I only saw photos of Mr. Lee,

208
00:15:52,640 --> 00:15:57,020
but he seemed perfect for a story like that.

209
00:15:59,690 --> 00:16:03,460
Seo Hye Jin, whom the director can't even touch

210
00:16:03,460 --> 00:16:07,720
used her authority to seduce a young man.

211
00:16:07,720 --> 00:16:09,720
Gross, right?

212
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:13,550
As a leader of a group and an educator, too.

213
00:16:13,550 --> 00:16:16,740
They kept it a secret since they were aware of it, too.

214
00:16:17,540 --> 00:16:21,210
Once Daechi-dong turns upside down,

215
00:16:21,210 --> 00:16:23,560
Seo Hye Jin won't be able to return

216
00:16:23,560 --> 00:16:26,360
and Kim Hyeon Tak would be automatically out, too.

217
00:16:28,470 --> 00:16:34,000
The question is, who will we use to spread the rumor?

218
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:38,990
It'd be more effective to use someone on her side.

219
00:16:43,530 --> 00:16:45,020
Gosh.

220
00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:49,440
Can you think of the right person?

221
00:16:57,110 --> 00:17:00,620
What will you do with Seo Hye Jin's files?

222
00:17:00,620 --> 00:17:04,210
I'm thinking of using it on Ms. Nam.

223
00:17:04,210 --> 00:17:09,870
I would need a different bait for the person who kept their relationship secret.

224
00:17:13,420 --> 00:17:18,090
Can I tell you what I've been thinking of?

225
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:24,230
This is way worse than your files getting stolen, right?

226
00:17:25,670 --> 00:17:27,350
Correct.

227
00:17:27,980 --> 00:17:30,690
The waves will come in from all directions.

228
00:17:32,190 --> 00:17:37,770
It'll be much worse than a few of the teachers quitting, right?

229
00:17:37,770 --> 00:17:39,450
Yes.

230
00:17:40,540 --> 00:17:45,080
Wu Seung Hui and Choi Hyeong Seon are...

231
00:17:46,470 --> 00:17:48,360
totally after me.

232
00:17:49,560 --> 00:17:51,750
It's bad timing, too.

233
00:17:53,930 --> 00:17:57,730
I had to insist on opening a class that doesn't qualify, too.

234
00:17:58,740 --> 00:18:04,360
We wanted to teach someone to be at the top of the country, but here we are.

235
00:18:08,790 --> 00:18:12,260
It's okay. It's not your fault.

236
00:18:14,690 --> 00:18:18,450
I'm not sure what the right answer is,

237
00:18:19,930 --> 00:18:21,820
but will you deny it?

238
00:18:21,820 --> 00:18:24,520
Will you say it's a false rumor and it's not true?

239
00:18:29,860 --> 00:18:31,970
I'd understand.

240
00:18:31,970 --> 00:18:33,750
You have a lot to lose.

241
00:18:33,750 --> 00:18:35,790
It's not that.

242
00:18:40,570 --> 00:18:45,610
I want to... be out in the open and fight.

243
00:18:45,610 --> 00:18:48,450
I'd have to tell ten lies to cover up one lie.

244
00:18:48,450 --> 00:18:51,390
I don't want to do that, but...

245
00:18:54,450 --> 00:18:56,360
I need your permission.

246
00:18:56,360 --> 00:18:58,440
Why would you need my permission?

247
00:18:58,440 --> 00:19:01,450
I didn't want to have a secret relationship from the beginning.

248
00:19:06,150 --> 00:19:08,220
I feel kind of bad.

249
00:19:09,660 --> 00:19:16,910
You're talented, brave, and have great potential.

250
00:19:16,910 --> 00:19:19,510
And you're young, too.

251
00:19:22,360 --> 00:19:27,290
The rumors will be nasty because you're involved with me.

252
00:19:36,580 --> 00:19:39,150
What are you doing right now?

253
00:19:40,430 --> 00:19:43,300
Why are you suddenly writing my transcript?

254
00:19:44,300 --> 00:19:48,230
"He's an excellent student, brave, and has great potential."

255
00:19:48,230 --> 00:19:51,340
- It's not that.
 - What is it, then?

256
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:57,430
Just say you love me.

257
00:20:18,870 --> 00:20:22,850
Do you want to get us some tea?

258
00:20:22,850 --> 00:20:25,070
The director will be here soon.

259
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:32,210
How much does he know?

260
00:20:32,210 --> 00:20:35,110
Only about the assistant director doing things behind his back.

261
00:20:35,110 --> 00:20:37,710
I haven't told him about us yet.

262
00:20:37,710 --> 00:20:40,330
Did you want my permission first?

263
00:20:41,030 --> 00:20:42,410
Yeah.

264
00:20:47,040 --> 00:20:48,520
Hello, Assistant Director.

265
00:20:48,520 --> 00:20:52,750
Oh, yes. Hello...

266
00:20:52,750 --> 00:20:56,520
- Prepare in advance since the orientation will be hectic.
 - Yes, got it.

267
00:20:56,520 --> 00:20:58,770
Hey, Team Leader Yun.

268
00:20:58,770 --> 00:21:01,050
Assistant Director, hello.

269
00:21:02,050 --> 00:21:03,300
You had a team meeting.

270
00:21:03,300 --> 00:21:05,100
- Yes.
- I see.

271
00:21:05,100 --> 00:21:07,490
Thanks for working hard.

272
00:21:07,490 --> 00:21:08,940
Sure. Well, then...

273
00:21:08,940 --> 00:21:11,370
- Team Leader Yun. 
- Yes.

274
00:21:11,370 --> 00:21:14,190
What's your schedule today?

275
00:21:14,190 --> 00:21:16,100
I have one class today. It ends at seven.

276
00:21:16,100 --> 00:21:17,390
That's perfect.

277
00:21:17,390 --> 00:21:21,140
Would you like to have dinner together if you're free?

278
00:21:21,140 --> 00:21:24,200
Oh, yes. Sounds good.

279
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:27,910
Gosh, you should've told me sooner.

280
00:21:27,910 --> 00:21:31,310
You should've told me when you learned the files were stolen.

281
00:21:31,310 --> 00:21:34,100
The files would've ended up with someone else

282
00:21:34,100 --> 00:21:37,880
and the Assistant Director would've left with the teachers, then.

283
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:40,370
- And—
 - One thing we have is

284
00:21:40,370 --> 00:21:43,940
that she isn't respected as a leader.

285
00:21:43,940 --> 00:21:46,030
Am I not more likable than her?

286
00:21:46,030 --> 00:21:51,840
Well, there's something I couldn't tell you through text.

287
00:22:01,580 --> 00:22:03,190
Hello.

288
00:22:28,550 --> 00:22:29,580
Did you get caught?

289
00:22:29,580 --> 00:22:31,840
- Pardon?
 - Pardon?

290
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:35,630
You two. Your relationship.

291
00:22:35,630 --> 00:22:37,310
Did the assistant director find out?

292
00:22:37,310 --> 00:22:38,610
Wait, what do you mean...

293
00:22:38,610 --> 00:22:42,340
Wait... how do you know...

294
00:22:42,340 --> 00:22:46,000
Shit! Geez...

295
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,470
- Hot!
 - Gosh.

296
00:22:48,470 --> 00:22:51,170
Well, d-did you know?

297
00:22:51,870 --> 00:22:55,060
This is why I wanted to hire Mr. Pyo.

298
00:22:55,060 --> 00:22:57,490
Why him?

299
00:22:58,910 --> 00:23:01,550
I was going to give him the Chanyeong class,

300
00:23:01,550 --> 00:23:04,800
promote you, and separate you two.

301
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:08,060
You've been hanging out too much since the joint lecture.

302
00:23:08,060 --> 00:23:09,100
Darn it...

303
00:23:09,100 --> 00:23:12,280
Hold on, hold on.

304
00:23:12,280 --> 00:23:14,570
How... Since when...

305
00:23:14,570 --> 00:23:16,340
What do you mean, since when?

306
00:23:16,340 --> 00:23:19,150
I knew you'd cause trouble from the beginning.

307
00:23:19,150 --> 00:23:24,770
I suspected it when Jun Ho suddenly came to Yangjae Canal.

308
00:23:24,770 --> 00:23:30,930
And I was certain when you said you rejected Choeseon Korean.

309
00:23:31,820 --> 00:23:34,740
All of those things happened before we started dating.

310
00:23:34,740 --> 00:23:37,110
Come on, seriously.

311
00:23:37,110 --> 00:23:39,750
I was devoted to making romance films.

312
00:23:39,750 --> 00:23:43,620
It's usually all about the tension before you start dating.

313
00:23:43,620 --> 00:23:46,820
The boiling pot of desire.

314
00:23:46,820 --> 00:23:53,250
Team Leader Seo's class got filled up first for the winter break lectures.

315
00:23:53,250 --> 00:23:57,620
No one makes steady profits like she does, as you know.

316
00:23:58,900 --> 00:24:01,960
Why did you want the monthly report now?

317
00:24:01,960 --> 00:24:05,360
Is Ms. Nam in class right now?

318
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:09,760
Yes, she'll be done soon. Why do you ask?

319
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:13,190
Seo Hye Jin might be the most stable one,

320
00:24:13,990 --> 00:24:18,120
but Nam Cheong Mi grew the most.

321
00:24:20,390 --> 00:24:24,520
Yes. She's talented.

322
00:24:24,520 --> 00:24:27,190
She's very ambitious,

323
00:24:27,190 --> 00:24:30,980
and her textbook is thorough. She's getting great feedback.

324
00:24:33,430 --> 00:24:35,470
I received the report from the consultation office.

325
00:24:35,470 --> 00:24:38,930
Your free lecture was received well.

326
00:24:38,930 --> 00:24:40,580
That's a relief.

327
00:24:40,580 --> 00:24:43,360
I was worried I might make you look bad.

328
00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:46,090
It was an impressive lecture.

329
00:24:47,580 --> 00:24:50,940
It was an excellent debut,

330
00:24:50,940 --> 00:24:54,430
but you can't teach like that from now on.

331
00:25:01,320 --> 00:25:06,270
Here are the files I created preparing for the Chanyeong class last semester.

332
00:25:09,300 --> 00:25:12,750
Don't worry. I didn't steal them.

333
00:25:13,430 --> 00:25:18,270
The TAs and I worked hard on them for about three weeks.

334
00:25:18,270 --> 00:25:20,860
I may not look like it, but I'm a hard worker.

335
00:25:20,860 --> 00:25:24,220
Yes, I suspected that.

336
00:25:24,800 --> 00:25:30,480
We need to bring all the students who got into Chanyeong High.

337
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:34,130
Forget about how you gave the free lecture

338
00:25:34,130 --> 00:25:36,750
and have a look at this first.

339
00:25:36,750 --> 00:25:39,370
Don't the academy teachers

340
00:25:39,370 --> 00:25:45,140
have the right to teach the way they want...

341
00:25:45,140 --> 00:25:47,010
on their own?

342
00:25:54,310 --> 00:25:59,780
Today will be the last day I tolerate your frustrating comments, too.

343
00:26:00,850 --> 00:26:05,650
Academy teachers are all about making a lot of money

344
00:26:05,650 --> 00:26:07,740
on their own.

345
00:26:22,540 --> 00:26:25,250
Don't you take your phone to your classroom?

346
00:26:25,250 --> 00:26:28,060
Why do I need my phone during the class?

347
00:26:29,190 --> 00:26:34,660
I need to focus so I can scold the distracted students as if my life depended on it.

348
00:26:34,660 --> 00:26:38,070
There's something I've been curious about.

349
00:26:38,070 --> 00:26:42,180
You don't have to do everything as if your life depends on it, right?

350
00:26:44,270 --> 00:26:47,690
I'm sorry if the expression bothered you. I won't say it again.

351
00:26:47,690 --> 00:26:50,520
No, it's not that.

352
00:26:50,520 --> 00:26:55,340
I'm saying you should be used to working in this neighborhood by now.

353
00:26:59,940 --> 00:27:02,490
I'm even more confused now.

354
00:27:02,490 --> 00:27:06,680
The students here are known for being quiet and diligent.

355
00:27:06,680 --> 00:27:09,350
I don't know what your old neighborhood was like,

356
00:27:09,350 --> 00:27:12,960
but you don't have to scold them too much.

357
00:27:19,950 --> 00:27:22,650
I've been curious about something, too.

358
00:27:23,400 --> 00:27:27,050
You settled down in this neighborhood before me.

359
00:27:27,050 --> 00:27:29,750
That's how you secured Yeongeun Arts High, too.

360
00:27:29,750 --> 00:27:31,610
- Yes.
 - Right?

361
00:27:31,610 --> 00:27:33,840
But what if...

362
00:27:34,520 --> 00:27:39,090
I aimed for that school as if my life depended on it, who would they follow?

363
00:27:39,090 --> 00:27:43,540
Are you sure you know the students better than I do?

364
00:27:44,180 --> 00:27:45,850
Do you mean it?

365
00:27:47,190 --> 00:27:50,200
I was just teasing you. Don't get so intense.

366
00:27:50,200 --> 00:27:52,120
Did I offend you?

367
00:27:52,120 --> 00:27:53,650
Yes.

368
00:27:54,560 --> 00:27:56,960
I'm sorry if I offended you.

369
00:27:58,310 --> 00:28:02,890
I don't care about how you teach,

370
00:28:04,090 --> 00:28:06,840
but don't discount hard work.

371
00:28:06,840 --> 00:28:10,450
How can you tell the students to study with an attitude like that?

372
00:28:10,450 --> 00:28:13,690
For what reason would you tell them to study for their future?

373
00:28:16,790 --> 00:28:19,510
I'll go to my class now.

374
00:28:21,330 --> 00:28:24,570
I'm trying to climb up by working hard as if my life depended on it.

375
00:28:24,570 --> 00:28:27,480
So you can stop...

376
00:28:28,180 --> 00:28:30,380
giving me advice.

377
00:28:40,570 --> 00:28:44,440
 Come to my office as soon as you get out of class. 

378
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:47,970
You were still here.

379
00:28:47,970 --> 00:28:50,630
- Hello.
 - Hello.

380
00:28:51,240 --> 00:28:54,050
Relax. Get comfortable.

381
00:29:00,730 --> 00:29:04,220
Jun Ho, do you want to help the owner?

382
00:29:04,220 --> 00:29:07,150
I'll talk to the Director for just a minute.

383
00:29:14,220 --> 00:29:17,470
Let me help you, sir.

384
00:29:17,470 --> 00:29:20,230
What brings you here so early?

385
00:29:24,690 --> 00:29:26,800
Ms. Seo and I got caught, apparently.

386
00:29:26,800 --> 00:29:28,070
Pardon?

387
00:29:30,580 --> 00:29:34,670
By the ones who want us to fail, unfortunately.

388
00:29:40,390 --> 00:29:43,050
D-Deny it for now, then.

389
00:29:44,670 --> 00:29:47,430
I'm sorry things turned out this way.

390
00:29:47,430 --> 00:29:50,640
Thank you for asking Jun Ho to leave. Gosh.

391
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:53,240
I'm so tired of pretending to be okay.

392
00:29:53,240 --> 00:29:55,050
I'm sorry.

393
00:29:56,640 --> 00:30:00,510
You can imagine what will happen, right?

394
00:30:02,110 --> 00:30:03,970
Yes.

395
00:30:03,970 --> 00:30:08,350
Having a battle in the academy won't be the end of it.

396
00:30:09,020 --> 00:30:11,780
That can't be what they're after.

397
00:30:12,900 --> 00:30:14,640
No.

398
00:30:15,790 --> 00:30:20,980
You'll get covered in sewer water.

399
00:30:25,280 --> 00:30:26,580
Yes.

400
00:30:26,580 --> 00:30:30,710
I've told you this once. I don't know if you remember.

401
00:30:30,710 --> 00:30:36,330
I said Jun Ho has always been at turning points in our lives.

402
00:30:36,330 --> 00:30:38,190
I remember.

403
00:30:39,070 --> 00:30:44,880
I'm sincerely thankful to you two.

404
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:50,000
And I turned the academy into a success thanks to you.

405
00:30:50,990 --> 00:30:53,620
I don't want to blame you two.

406
00:30:54,220 --> 00:30:56,580
This might sound cowardly,

407
00:30:56,580 --> 00:31:00,120
but let's try denying it for now.

408
00:31:00,120 --> 00:31:02,340
Say you aren't together.

409
00:31:03,050 --> 00:31:06,860
I'll introduce Jun Ho to a bigger academy.

410
00:31:13,430 --> 00:31:16,040
 Just say you love me. 

411
00:31:19,720 --> 00:31:21,640
Seo Hye Jin.

412
00:31:26,940 --> 00:31:29,660
- Director.
 - Yes.

413
00:31:33,640 --> 00:31:37,480
I'm willing to get covered in sewer water.

414
00:31:38,090 --> 00:31:41,900
- Hye Jin.
 - Lying won't prevent the rumor from spreading.

415
00:31:41,900 --> 00:31:47,040
And Jun Ho would look bad if I tried to survive on my own.

416
00:31:47,040 --> 00:31:49,240
It would make it look like

417
00:31:49,240 --> 00:31:52,910
he seduced me because he was blinded by success.

418
00:31:52,910 --> 00:31:54,760
As for that—

419
00:31:56,130 --> 00:31:58,360
I don't want to do that.

420
00:32:01,280 --> 00:32:06,370
I never thought my records were that great.

421
00:32:06,370 --> 00:32:08,540
I have the data right here.

422
00:32:08,540 --> 00:32:12,150
I'm thankful you think highly of me,

423
00:32:12,150 --> 00:32:15,070
but I know what I did better than anyone.

424
00:32:15,070 --> 00:32:17,490
I had a big boost in profit in the first month

425
00:32:17,490 --> 00:32:21,660
because Team Leader Seo split the 11th-grade Chanyeong class with me.

426
00:32:21,660 --> 00:32:24,490
It's okay to accept compliments like this.

427
00:32:24,490 --> 00:32:28,790
Teachers often lose classes the academy puts together for them.

428
00:32:28,790 --> 00:32:31,820
It's because I didn't do it on my own.

429
00:32:32,900 --> 00:32:37,700
I want the class I created to be a success in Daechi-dong.

430
00:32:38,410 --> 00:32:42,550
Your track record is great, and so is your attitude.

431
00:32:42,550 --> 00:32:49,190
The academy will have to support you accordingly.

432
00:32:53,350 --> 00:32:56,600
I don't have any special complaints right now.

433
00:32:56,600 --> 00:33:00,220
I used to clean the classroom myself at my previous job.

434
00:33:02,730 --> 00:33:06,320
Don't compare us to a lousy academy like that.

435
00:33:06,320 --> 00:33:09,840
Are you satisfied that someone else cleans?

436
00:33:09,840 --> 00:33:11,430
It's not that.

437
00:33:11,430 --> 00:33:13,690
I suppose...

438
00:33:13,690 --> 00:33:19,180
you might end up having to clean your classroom.

439
00:33:19,180 --> 00:33:20,860
Pardon?

440
00:33:20,860 --> 00:33:24,840
That's how Seo Hye Jin got started, too.

441
00:33:24,840 --> 00:33:28,320
If the academy shrinks back to its original size...

442
00:33:31,020 --> 00:33:34,560
I'm not sure what you're referring to.

443
00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:41,510
This means that this academy will soon become a shipwreck.

444
00:33:41,510 --> 00:33:43,940
But you can hop on the cruise ship and

445
00:33:43,940 --> 00:33:47,980
have the largest Chanyeong High class.

446
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:53,740
Of course, it'd be up to you.

447
00:34:14,990 --> 00:34:16,630
You're leaving early.

448
00:34:16,630 --> 00:34:19,150
Yes, I'm meeting someone.

449
00:34:19,150 --> 00:34:21,390
That's great.

450
00:34:21,390 --> 00:34:26,550
I've felt bad that you always seemed lonely.

451
00:34:30,630 --> 00:34:32,940
Connections are one's assets.

452
00:34:32,940 --> 00:34:35,460
I learned that from you.

453
00:34:37,270 --> 00:34:40,700
If I asked whom you were meeting,

454
00:34:40,700 --> 00:34:43,980
would it be too intrusive?

455
00:34:43,980 --> 00:34:47,590
I'm having dinner with Team Leader Yun.

456
00:34:47,590 --> 00:34:51,630
I thought he could use some encouragement.

457
00:34:52,430 --> 00:34:54,250
Well, then...

458
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:07,660
Team Leader Yun.

459
00:35:22,510 --> 00:35:24,230
Why Team Leader Yun?

460
00:35:24,230 --> 00:35:26,890
I'll go to the class for now. Let's talk afterward.

461
00:35:26,890 --> 00:35:29,490
I'll be talking to Ms. Nam.

462
00:35:29,490 --> 00:35:31,220
I think I should let her know.

463
00:35:31,220 --> 00:35:32,590
Yes.

464
00:35:38,790 --> 00:35:39,970
Do you need something?

465
00:35:39,970 --> 00:35:41,860
- We'll have another makgeolli.
 - Okay.

466
00:35:41,860 --> 00:35:44,830
- Eonni.
 - Welcome.

467
00:35:44,830 --> 00:35:46,100
Thank you.

468
00:35:46,100 --> 00:35:49,220
- It's been so long.
 - I know.

469
00:35:49,220 --> 00:35:51,420
You're looking great.

470
00:35:51,420 --> 00:35:54,380
No, you do. You look great.

471
00:35:54,380 --> 00:35:55,770
You really look like a manager.

472
00:35:55,770 --> 00:35:58,720
It's because I am. Come on.

473
00:35:58,720 --> 00:36:00,660
You look exceptional.

474
00:36:01,380 --> 00:36:04,770
I've been meaning to see you, but it's so hard.

475
00:36:04,770 --> 00:36:08,820
It took too long to get free from my sons and husband.

476
00:36:10,180 --> 00:36:12,490
Let's order something. You must be hungry after work.

477
00:36:12,490 --> 00:36:15,150
Excuse me. Over here.

478
00:36:15,150 --> 00:36:17,070
Over here.

479
00:36:17,070 --> 00:36:21,410
He's not just stubborn. He's so eloquent, too.

480
00:36:21,410 --> 00:36:23,100
"Trust me.

481
00:36:23,100 --> 00:36:25,510
I'm trying not to be dependent on you."

482
00:36:25,510 --> 00:36:28,600
Hearing that almost convinced me.

483
00:36:28,600 --> 00:36:32,300
But once I get in bed after thinking, "Maybe I should,"

484
00:36:32,300 --> 00:36:35,650
I start getting all sorts of worries again.

485
00:36:36,450 --> 00:36:40,420
It must be difficult to accept it fully with your heart.

486
00:36:40,420 --> 00:36:41,770
So I said,

487
00:36:41,770 --> 00:36:45,080
"Fine. Might as well try working for a major academy."

488
00:36:45,080 --> 00:36:49,830
And that made him flip out again.

489
00:36:49,830 --> 00:36:52,660
Jun Ho tends to be that way.

490
00:36:53,720 --> 00:36:57,530
Would it be okay to trust him and let him be?

491
00:36:57,530 --> 00:36:59,760
Well, you know...

492
00:37:00,750 --> 00:37:05,340
it's my job to tell people what to do with their kids,

493
00:37:05,340 --> 00:37:07,050
but this is not easy to say.

494
00:37:07,050 --> 00:37:08,800
Just be honest with me.

495
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:12,850
We really don't know what he's thinking.

496
00:37:12,850 --> 00:37:15,810
When we thought he was struggling at work,

497
00:37:15,810 --> 00:37:19,780
we considered paying for his education abroad, too.

498
00:37:19,780 --> 00:37:25,310
Just think of it as advice. It's just my personal opinion.

499
00:37:26,540 --> 00:37:28,580
Try giving him a chance.

500
00:37:28,580 --> 00:37:30,030
What?

501
00:37:30,030 --> 00:37:33,320
Your son is something else.

502
00:37:34,490 --> 00:37:35,980
Really?

503
00:37:35,980 --> 00:37:38,710
I think he'll do something big.

504
00:37:43,140 --> 00:37:45,270
See you tomorrow.

505
00:37:45,270 --> 00:37:46,440
Bye.

506
00:37:46,440 --> 00:37:49,660
- Take care.
 - See you.

507
00:37:56,680 --> 00:37:58,350
Ms. Nam,

508
00:37:59,580 --> 00:38:02,540
you don't have a class tomorrow morning, right?

509
00:38:02,540 --> 00:38:04,040
No.

510
00:38:04,690 --> 00:38:06,780
Let's go out for a drink.

511
00:38:06,780 --> 00:38:08,470
It's on me.

512
00:38:10,180 --> 00:38:11,850
I'm sorry, but I'll take a rain check.

513
00:38:11,850 --> 00:38:14,730
I'm not feeling so well today.

514
00:38:15,660 --> 00:38:17,160
Okay.

515
00:38:19,600 --> 00:38:22,500
By chance, has Assis—

516
00:38:24,640 --> 00:38:26,230
I'm sorry.

517
00:38:29,720 --> 00:38:31,310
Hi, Mom.

518
00:38:36,510 --> 00:38:38,080
I miss my son.

519
00:38:38,080 --> 00:38:40,710
Aigoo, seriously. My gosh.

520
00:38:40,710 --> 00:38:43,090
This is classic unrequited love.

521
00:38:43,090 --> 00:38:46,340
Thinking about it makes me upset,

522
00:38:46,340 --> 00:38:48,100
but I love him when I see him.

523
00:38:48,100 --> 00:38:50,220
I know.

524
00:38:50,220 --> 00:38:54,010
Have you been upset because of Seung Gyu?

525
00:38:55,910 --> 00:39:00,480
Not exactly upset, but he frustrated me to death.

526
00:39:00,480 --> 00:39:02,070
Is it because of Jun Ho?

527
00:39:02,070 --> 00:39:03,550
Yes.

528
00:39:04,380 --> 00:39:08,670
His friend, who barely managed to be at the bottom

529
00:39:08,670 --> 00:39:10,990
in the first exam climbed all over him,

530
00:39:10,990 --> 00:39:13,570
but he just laughed about it. He was happy.

531
00:39:13,570 --> 00:39:15,360
Seriously.

532
00:39:17,050 --> 00:39:20,640
He laughed it off when Jun Ho passed him in ranking,

533
00:39:20,740 --> 00:39:22,940
when he entered a better college,

534
00:39:22,940 --> 00:39:26,470
and when he got into a top company, too. Gosh...

535
00:39:27,150 --> 00:39:30,110
I scolded him a lot each time that happened.

536
00:39:31,570 --> 00:39:33,000
Seriously.

537
00:39:34,680 --> 00:39:37,880
I felt like I was on top of the world whenever he did that.

538
00:39:37,880 --> 00:39:40,700
Aigoo, seriously.

539
00:39:42,330 --> 00:39:46,350
When Jun Ho said he'd join the academy,

540
00:39:46,350 --> 00:39:49,530
I was kind of happy about it.

541
00:39:49,530 --> 00:39:53,710
I thought, "Gosh, he's finally failing in life."

542
00:39:53,710 --> 00:39:56,920
Gosh, that's too cruel.

543
00:39:59,400 --> 00:40:02,820
But not anymore.

544
00:40:03,530 --> 00:40:08,680
Since he could be the director of my academy

545
00:40:08,680 --> 00:40:13,330
someday, I'm planning to support him.

546
00:40:13,330 --> 00:40:16,760
You said it'd be Seo Hye Jin before.

547
00:40:16,760 --> 00:40:19,180
She's now...

548
00:40:20,030 --> 00:40:22,080
going downhill.

549
00:40:23,450 --> 00:40:25,740
You're in the middle of a crowded market

550
00:40:25,740 --> 00:40:28,960
in the Qing Dynasty in the late 18th century.

551
00:40:28,960 --> 00:40:31,080
Read the question while imagining that.

552
00:40:31,080 --> 00:40:35,020
"What's the most appropriate meaning of A considering the context?"

553
00:40:35,020 --> 00:40:38,960
Let's look at A. "The seeds of a serious crisis...

554
00:40:42,030 --> 00:40:44,890
the crisis was being spread."

555
00:40:45,910 --> 00:40:48,690
Seeds of crisis. It was explained just now, right?

556
00:40:48,690 --> 00:40:51,750
You have to think of the answer and look at the examples.

557
00:40:51,750 --> 00:40:55,690
Look. What is it? "The danger of rebellion..."

558
00:40:59,350 --> 00:41:00,980
I'm sorry.

559
00:41:07,520 --> 00:41:09,730
Yes, Mom.

560
00:41:09,730 --> 00:41:12,040
I'm on my way.

561
00:41:12,040 --> 00:41:14,040
I know. The son comes before the husband.

562
00:41:14,040 --> 00:41:15,860
I'll be there soon.

563
00:41:30,520 --> 00:41:34,880
 My mom says she misses me a lot after having a drink. 

564
00:41:34,880 --> 00:41:37,820
 I'll drop her off and meet you at the academy. 

565
00:41:42,480 --> 00:41:44,060
Min Ji, you can go ahead.

566
00:41:44,060 --> 00:41:46,470
- Thank you for today.
 - Sure.

567
00:41:47,350 --> 00:41:51,810
Did you say you're going back to school in March?

568
00:41:51,810 --> 00:41:53,750
I haven't decided yet.

569
00:41:53,750 --> 00:41:55,220
You need a substitute, right?

570
00:41:55,220 --> 00:41:57,970
When do I need to let you know?

571
00:41:58,800 --> 00:42:02,610
You can take your time. I'm not in a rush.

572
00:42:02,610 --> 00:42:04,150
Okay.

573
00:42:10,590 --> 00:42:14,550
 Drink with her if you have to and safely drop her off at home. 

574
00:42:14,550 --> 00:42:16,700
 Thank you for the meal. 

575
00:42:20,980 --> 00:42:23,430
You scared me. What's going on?

576
00:42:23,430 --> 00:42:26,790
What do you mean? I'm your mom's friend's son.

577
00:42:27,660 --> 00:42:29,800
Our moms are unbelievable.

578
00:42:29,800 --> 00:42:33,350
I was disappointed that Ms. Nam went home early,

579
00:42:33,350 --> 00:42:35,700
but this isn't too bad, right?

580
00:42:35,700 --> 00:42:37,380
Let's drink makgeolli on my mom's card.

581
00:42:37,380 --> 00:42:38,830
Hey,

582
00:42:39,630 --> 00:42:43,450
did Ms. Nam tell you anything else?

583
00:42:43,450 --> 00:42:45,310
What was I supposed to hear?

584
00:42:45,310 --> 00:42:47,990
It's nothing. Let's go.

585
00:42:48,640 --> 00:42:50,650
What is it?

586
00:42:50,650 --> 00:42:52,230
Hey.

587
00:43:16,150 --> 00:43:22,280
 Daechi Choeseon Korean 

588
00:43:31,540 --> 00:43:35,160
 I'm having dinner with Team Leader Yun. 

589
00:43:35,160 --> 00:43:39,320
 I thought he could use some encouragement. 

590
00:43:56,180 --> 00:43:58,550
 Passcode accepted. 

591
00:44:02,100 --> 00:44:03,900
Team Leader.

592
00:44:06,280 --> 00:44:09,150
I saw your car in the parking lot.

593
00:44:09,150 --> 00:44:11,510
So, I came up just in case.

594
00:44:37,420 --> 00:44:39,670
Are you creating a new textbook, then?

595
00:44:39,670 --> 00:44:44,210
Yes. I thought the entrance exam one was getting old.

596
00:44:44,210 --> 00:44:48,380
Is it old? I thought you printed it before the last winter break.

597
00:44:49,370 --> 00:44:51,500
I remember all sorts of things, don't I?

598
00:44:52,960 --> 00:44:54,760
You do.

599
00:44:58,370 --> 00:45:00,320
- I was going to call—
 - Jun Ho—

600
00:45:04,320 --> 00:45:06,480
Where's Jun Ho? Why are you alone?

601
00:45:06,480 --> 00:45:10,480
Isn't it scary to be here alone at night?

602
00:45:10,480 --> 00:45:13,690
I'm used to being alone here. It's fine.

603
00:45:13,690 --> 00:45:15,810
Jun Ho is...

604
00:45:17,750 --> 00:45:20,580
The assistant director told you, right?

605
00:45:20,580 --> 00:45:22,210
Yes.

606
00:45:25,010 --> 00:45:27,210
I was very surprised.

607
00:45:28,210 --> 00:45:32,290
I was surprised to hear she'd go independent, but...

608
00:45:32,910 --> 00:45:36,110
I was about 10,000 times more surprised

609
00:45:36,110 --> 00:45:39,100
when I heard about you and Jun Ho.

610
00:45:39,760 --> 00:45:42,440
I'm surprised I didn't pass out right there.

611
00:45:54,560 --> 00:45:56,510
It must be true.

612
00:46:00,370 --> 00:46:03,640
Assistant Director Wu always hated you.

613
00:46:03,640 --> 00:46:07,150
I wanted to ask you directly to make sure she didn't make it up.

614
00:46:09,210 --> 00:46:12,950
I hope you accept it without bias.

615
00:46:12,950 --> 00:46:14,490
What bias?

616
00:46:14,490 --> 00:46:17,140
Jun Ho getting the ad modeling gig when he joined us,

617
00:46:17,140 --> 00:46:21,130
doing a joint lecture with me, and starting a new class recently.

618
00:46:21,130 --> 00:46:24,550
None of that has to do with our relationship.

619
00:46:27,440 --> 00:46:28,980
You're so calm about it.

620
00:46:28,980 --> 00:46:31,820
I think you'll understand me.

621
00:46:31,820 --> 00:46:35,440
You and I are the starting members of this academy.

622
00:46:35,440 --> 00:46:36,790
If you were in my position, you would've—

623
00:46:36,790 --> 00:46:39,050
You're so eloquent.

624
00:46:39,670 --> 00:46:42,290
I've always noticed it, but you really are.

625
00:46:43,310 --> 00:46:45,730
You almost fooled me.

626
00:46:45,730 --> 00:46:48,620
I almost thought you actually cared about your colleagues.

627
00:46:48,620 --> 00:46:51,520
- Team Leader—
 - That's why I always fell for it.

628
00:46:52,720 --> 00:46:55,460
When you asked me to reject Jun Ho,

629
00:46:55,460 --> 00:46:57,650
when you said you approved him,

630
00:46:58,320 --> 00:47:00,890
when you said you tutored him secretly,

631
00:47:02,200 --> 00:47:05,180
and when you were thinking of joining Choeseon Korean, too.

632
00:47:10,820 --> 00:47:13,910
I don't know if it's cowardly to say this.

633
00:47:16,440 --> 00:47:19,280
It wasn't because you were eloquent.

634
00:47:28,840 --> 00:47:31,400
It was because I had feelings for you.

635
00:47:33,870 --> 00:47:37,370
That's not something I can help you with.

636
00:47:37,370 --> 00:47:39,860
It's not like you told me what was going on.

637
00:47:39,860 --> 00:47:44,200
But you knew that I was always lurking around you.

638
00:47:48,040 --> 00:47:50,890
You should've given me a hint.

639
00:47:50,890 --> 00:47:53,950
I wouldn't have embarrassed myself, then.

640
00:47:54,510 --> 00:47:59,320
I've never thought you were embarrassing or anything like that.

641
00:48:00,230 --> 00:48:02,500
Whenever I caused trouble or clashed with others,

642
00:48:02,500 --> 00:48:05,940
I was thankful that you always defended me.

643
00:48:05,940 --> 00:48:07,800
But...

644
00:48:07,800 --> 00:48:10,500
I don't know what you heard exactly,

645
00:48:10,500 --> 00:48:13,500
but I'm not the one who's trying to take advantage

646
00:48:13,500 --> 00:48:15,580
of your feelings. It's Assistant Director Wu.

647
00:48:15,580 --> 00:48:18,040
- She's trying to divide people— 
 - I know.

648
00:48:19,310 --> 00:48:21,360
You think I don't even know that?

649
00:48:26,210 --> 00:48:28,830
You don't mind me grabbing a coffee, right?

650
00:49:07,600 --> 00:49:09,740
What an idiot.

651
00:49:27,470 --> 00:49:29,440
Have some.

652
00:49:29,440 --> 00:49:33,990
I use a fan even in this weather because of hyperthermia.

653
00:49:33,990 --> 00:49:36,820
Eonni, you need to take cinnamon for that.

654
00:49:36,820 --> 00:49:38,850
I heard cinnamon is best for you these days.

655
00:49:38,850 --> 00:49:40,290
I drink a lot of sujeonggwa (a traditional Korean dessert drink).

656
00:49:40,290 --> 00:49:42,500
That's not the same thing.

657
00:49:42,500 --> 00:49:45,560
Since our moms are buying, we should hang in there.

658
00:49:45,560 --> 00:49:47,470
She's going through menopause.

659
00:49:47,470 --> 00:49:50,070
- Seriously.
 - Sujeonggwa is made with cinnamon.

660
00:49:50,070 --> 00:49:53,290
You have to take it by itself. Don't laugh.

661
00:49:53,290 --> 00:49:56,120
- Mom, your phone is ringing. 
 - I'm sure it's Dad.

662
00:49:56,770 --> 00:50:01,070
- It was scientifically proven.
 - Is it okay to ignore it, then?

663
00:50:06,070 --> 00:50:10,750
I'm not whining that I like you, too, right now.

664
00:50:11,830 --> 00:50:15,810
But I can't keep staying with you and Jun Ho.

665
00:50:17,060 --> 00:50:20,310
The Assistant Director might be taking advantage of my feelings,

666
00:50:21,210 --> 00:50:24,480
but that's still better than being deceived by you two.

667
00:50:25,450 --> 00:50:29,700
I would've behaved differently if you told me how you felt.

668
00:50:29,700 --> 00:50:31,660
Are you blaming me?

669
00:50:31,660 --> 00:50:34,550
I'm not saying I didn't deceive you.

670
00:50:37,570 --> 00:50:39,960
You've never looked at me this long, either.

671
00:50:39,960 --> 00:50:42,730
What was I supposed to say and how?

672
00:50:47,630 --> 00:50:50,060
I'm curious about this one thing, then.

673
00:50:51,330 --> 00:50:54,110
Would I have had a chance if I had confessed my feelings

674
00:50:55,010 --> 00:50:57,020
before Jun Ho came here?

675
00:51:00,740 --> 00:51:02,410
No.

676
00:51:04,540 --> 00:51:06,040
Right?

677
00:51:08,930 --> 00:51:12,050
That's the perk of being in one-sided love.

678
00:51:12,050 --> 00:51:17,280
It's cowardly, but it lets you linger nearby feeling safe.

679
00:51:19,280 --> 00:51:21,260
It's been fun all this time.

680
00:51:22,260 --> 00:51:25,080
Having coffee together in the morning,

681
00:51:25,080 --> 00:51:27,150
talking about the weather

682
00:51:27,150 --> 00:51:29,440
and students, too.

683
00:51:31,510 --> 00:51:33,580
It was nice.

684
00:51:33,580 --> 00:51:37,710
The new academy Assistant Director is starting will be handed over to Director Choi.

685
00:51:37,710 --> 00:51:40,120
She might make it sound like you'll be treated better

686
00:51:40,120 --> 00:51:42,340
- than now, but—
 - You don't have to worry.

687
00:51:43,030 --> 00:51:44,850
We're all adults.

688
00:51:44,850 --> 00:51:47,420
They'll make the decision on their own.

689
00:51:47,420 --> 00:51:49,210
"They"?

690
00:51:49,890 --> 00:51:51,690
By "they," you mean...

691
00:51:51,690 --> 00:51:55,080
There's a group chat without you and Jun Ho in it.

692
00:51:55,670 --> 00:51:57,910
We'll meet before class tomorrow.

693
00:51:59,280 --> 00:52:01,610
This is exactly what the Assistant Director wanted.

694
00:52:01,610 --> 00:52:03,100
Yes.

695
00:52:04,050 --> 00:52:05,860
I said I know.

696
00:52:09,490 --> 00:52:11,380
- So cold.
 - Thank you for the meal.

697
00:52:11,380 --> 00:52:16,020
Aigoo, why does it keep ringing?

698
00:52:16,020 --> 00:52:18,740
- What's wrong?
 - Let's see.

699
00:52:20,050 --> 00:52:21,660
What is it?

700
00:52:28,230 --> 00:52:30,300
Gosh, Jun Ho.

701
00:52:31,930 --> 00:52:33,850
What's going on?

702
00:52:33,850 --> 00:52:35,590
It's nothing.

703
00:52:36,470 --> 00:52:40,380
Ma'am, can I look?

704
00:52:42,170 --> 00:52:43,790
It's okay.

705
00:52:55,480 --> 00:52:58,390
Mom, I'm seeing someone.

706
00:52:58,390 --> 00:53:00,220
Hey, you—

707
00:53:00,990 --> 00:53:06,450
What are you suddenly talking about in the middle of the streets?

708
00:53:12,640 --> 00:53:14,660
I'm seeing her seriously.

709
00:53:14,660 --> 00:53:16,530
I know you're seeing someone.

710
00:53:16,530 --> 00:53:18,120
When I went to your place last time—

711
00:53:18,120 --> 00:53:20,220
It's Ms. Seo Hye Jin.

712
00:53:24,160 --> 00:53:28,770
Seung Gyu, what's he saying right now?

713
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:35,250
 I'm requesting an open discussion on Mr. Lee's winter break lecture, "Reading Training." 

714
00:53:35,900 --> 00:53:39,340
 I heard he was able to teach this class 

715
00:53:39,340 --> 00:53:43,220
 due to his special relationship with Team Leader Seo. 

716
00:53:43,220 --> 00:53:46,440
 This is not a false rumor created to slander them. 

717
00:53:48,030 --> 00:53:52,900
 Using her position as the academy's leading teacher and team leader, 

718
00:53:52,900 --> 00:53:58,410
 Ms. Seo has been giving the academy's resources to her boyfriend, Lee Jun Ho. 

719
00:53:58,410 --> 00:54:00,570
 We need to discuss other things that happened 

720
00:54:00,570 --> 00:54:05,000
 since Mr. Lee joined the academy as well in the past year. 

721
00:54:05,990 --> 00:54:10,780
 I'd like to ask you how you feel about this matter. 

722
00:54:14,730 --> 00:54:18,930
 Team Leader, I just got a weird message. Is it true? 

723
00:54:18,930 --> 00:54:21,480
 Are you and Mr. Lee dating? 

724
00:54:21,480 --> 00:54:24,690
 Are you playing a trick behind my back? 

725
00:54:45,540 --> 00:54:46,920
I'll get going.

726
00:54:46,920 --> 00:54:49,520
Sleep well. Have some honey water, too.

727
00:54:50,180 --> 00:54:53,000
 - The door is open. 
 - Sleep over.

728
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:54,710
I need to go.

729
00:54:55,520 --> 00:54:57,560
I'm worried about Ms. Seo.

730
00:54:58,650 --> 00:55:01,860
Seriously! You really know how to upset me.

731
00:55:01,860 --> 00:55:04,430
What's wrong with you?

732
00:55:04,430 --> 00:55:07,010
Seriously, what's wrong with you?

733
00:55:07,010 --> 00:55:09,130
Why are you doing this?

734
00:55:09,130 --> 00:55:12,990
I'm so upset. What's wrong with you?

735
00:56:19,910 --> 00:56:21,390
Ms. Seo.

736
00:56:22,360 --> 00:56:24,010
Let's go out.

737
00:56:25,680 --> 00:56:28,020
I can't stay here because I'm so nervous.

738
00:56:28,800 --> 00:56:30,240
Why?

739
00:56:30,240 --> 00:56:32,160
Did something happen?

740
00:56:33,060 --> 00:56:35,330
Team Leader Yun was here.

741
00:56:35,330 --> 00:56:39,500
He said he'd discuss our matter with everyone.

742
00:56:43,130 --> 00:56:45,730
I must've led my life more poorly than I thought.

743
00:56:45,730 --> 00:56:48,020
No one's on our side.

744
00:56:48,600 --> 00:56:51,740
I saw the text Team Leader Yun sent.

745
00:56:51,740 --> 00:56:54,600
I can explain everything.

746
00:56:54,600 --> 00:56:57,210
I'll make them understand like Ms. Nam did.

747
00:56:59,570 --> 00:57:01,280
Let's leave.

748
00:57:08,900 --> 00:57:12,660
What's going on? What made you call me first?

749
00:57:14,730 --> 00:57:18,770
I can't drive you home tonight since I had makgeolli.

750
00:57:18,770 --> 00:57:21,660
That's not why I wanted to see you.

751
00:57:30,400 --> 00:57:35,200
I live with a co-worker of yours.

752
00:57:35,200 --> 00:57:37,430
I got the gist of it.

753
00:57:37,430 --> 00:57:40,860
I brought this out because it might be a long chat.

754
00:57:41,750 --> 00:57:43,530
Thank you.

755
00:57:59,700 --> 00:58:02,200
I'm facing two paths.

756
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:06,380
It's between ambition and loyalty.

757
00:58:08,500 --> 00:58:11,630
I like how sensational it sounds,

758
00:58:11,630 --> 00:58:16,400
but is this... that big of a deal?

759
00:58:16,400 --> 00:58:18,740
Enough to shake up the academy?

760
00:58:19,820 --> 00:58:22,090
It's not,

761
00:58:22,090 --> 00:58:25,470
but it's about to be that way. That's why it's a problem.

762
00:58:28,180 --> 00:58:34,910
Team Leader Seo will become a half-crazy person around here tomorrow.

763
00:58:36,550 --> 00:58:38,070
Is it that serious?

764
00:58:38,070 --> 00:58:42,710
They think they have something major on them for finding out their relationship.

765
00:58:42,710 --> 00:58:45,950
I'm sure they'll milk it as much as they can.

766
00:58:46,850 --> 00:58:52,280
Even if no one asks, the other academies will volunteer to spread the rumor.

767
00:58:52,280 --> 00:58:54,930
Once all of Team Leader Seo's students leave,

768
00:58:54,930 --> 00:58:57,940
they'll try to take them somehow.

769
00:59:00,130 --> 00:59:06,740
It's like a huge chunk of meat fell in front of a pack of hyenas just now.

770
00:59:09,310 --> 00:59:11,230
And...

771
00:59:12,790 --> 00:59:16,890
I'm in a position where I can eat the meat first.

772
00:59:19,570 --> 00:59:21,650
If so...

773
00:59:22,350 --> 00:59:24,110
you should eat it.

774
00:59:25,350 --> 00:59:28,120
- Right? 
- Yes.

775
00:59:28,120 --> 00:59:33,460
That's why you came to this neighborhood without anything and worked yourself to death.

776
00:59:33,460 --> 00:59:35,900
Loyalty is useless.

777
00:59:39,610 --> 00:59:41,710
Are you being sarcastic?

778
00:59:41,710 --> 00:59:43,780
Not at all.

779
00:59:44,780 --> 00:59:47,680
Are you sure you understood me just now?

780
00:59:49,570 --> 00:59:52,360
I said I have to tear apart your best friend

781
00:59:52,360 --> 00:59:55,750
and the teacher who used to teach you.

782
00:59:55,750 --> 00:59:58,670
No one would even notice if you didn't eat.

783
00:59:58,670 --> 01:00:04,550
You said everyone would bite, chew, taste, and enjoy this.

784
01:00:11,530 --> 01:00:15,480
Instead, let's not make Lee Jun Ho treat us to an expensive meal.

785
01:00:16,880 --> 01:00:21,220
I think you'd have to treat him for a while.

786
01:00:23,970 --> 01:00:27,910
Geez, what do I do?

787
01:00:29,930 --> 01:00:33,040
If I make money that way and buy you an expensive meal,

788
01:00:33,040 --> 01:00:35,450
would you even eat it?

789
01:00:37,640 --> 01:00:40,710
I'll give it a thought.

790
01:00:41,740 --> 01:00:44,080
I might get an upset stomach.

791
01:00:53,740 --> 01:00:55,710
What's going on?

792
01:00:55,710 --> 01:00:57,530
It's almost midnight.

793
01:00:57,530 --> 01:00:59,150
Assistant Director,

794
01:01:00,220 --> 01:01:02,800
you received the text from Team Leader Yun, right?

795
01:01:04,990 --> 01:01:08,210
Did you know about Seo Hye Jin and Lee Jun Ho?

796
01:01:11,320 --> 01:01:15,310
Why didn't you discuss that with me first?

797
01:01:17,200 --> 01:01:19,050
"Discuss"?

798
01:01:19,050 --> 01:01:20,890
I mean...

799
01:01:20,890 --> 01:01:23,800
If you'd told me first,

800
01:01:23,800 --> 01:01:28,090
I would've talked to everyone and convinced them.

801
01:01:28,090 --> 01:01:31,610
If you'd considered my position...

802
01:01:34,530 --> 01:01:36,710
I'm definitely

803
01:01:36,710 --> 01:01:42,640
grateful to you, Team Leader Lee.

804
01:01:42,640 --> 01:01:46,100
You got me Seo Hye Jin's files and everything.

805
01:01:46,100 --> 01:01:49,080
But...

806
01:01:49,080 --> 01:01:53,400
shouldn't you be thankful to me, too?

807
01:01:54,620 --> 01:01:57,260
You lost your students to the international school teacher Choeseon Korean hired

808
01:01:57,260 --> 01:02:00,550
and lost a whole class, but I forgave you.

809
01:02:00,550 --> 01:02:04,640
And I stopped Director Kim from adjusting the rate of pay, too.

810
01:02:04,640 --> 01:02:06,580
You laundered your resume using the graduate school—

811
01:02:06,580 --> 01:02:08,210
Assistant Director.

812
01:02:08,210 --> 01:02:10,600
Everyone already knows

813
01:02:10,600 --> 01:02:13,790
that you're my person.

814
01:02:13,790 --> 01:02:16,610
And they know we never liked Seo Hye Jin, too. But,

815
01:02:16,610 --> 01:02:20,880
if you spread a rumor about Seo Hye Jin and Lee Jun Ho,

816
01:02:20,880 --> 01:02:23,970
how believable would that be?

817
01:02:27,240 --> 01:02:31,020
If the rumor spreads outside the academy,

818
01:02:31,020 --> 01:02:35,270
it won't matter where it came from, but...

819
01:02:39,820 --> 01:02:41,810
I understand.

820
01:02:44,610 --> 01:02:49,500
What if we say she dated him since he was a minor...

821
01:02:49,500 --> 01:02:51,660
Is that too much?

822
01:02:54,750 --> 01:02:59,310
You would've been better at writing fiction

823
01:02:59,310 --> 01:03:02,760
than teaching Korean.

824
01:03:03,820 --> 01:03:06,720
Once I get my new position, Seo Hye Jin's files...

825
01:03:07,520 --> 01:03:09,350
will be mine.

826
01:03:11,360 --> 01:03:12,720
Okay?

827
01:03:25,140 --> 01:03:26,810
 Go home. 

828
01:03:30,190 --> 01:03:31,590
Please?

829
01:03:33,390 --> 01:03:35,660
Did you have dinner?

830
01:03:37,820 --> 01:03:39,890
I'll eat at home.

831
01:03:40,940 --> 01:03:42,610
You're lying.

832
01:03:47,880 --> 01:03:50,030
I want to feed you.

833
01:03:52,650 --> 01:03:57,580
♫  I can remember when  ♫

834
01:03:58,600 --> 01:04:01,540
The rice isn't great, but the side dishes are good.

835
01:04:01,540 --> 01:04:02,700
My mom made them.

836
01:04:02,700 --> 01:04:07,860
♫  And things were simple then  ♫

837
01:04:07,860 --> 01:04:12,400
♫  And I ran wild  ♫

838
01:04:14,520 --> 01:04:17,730
It must be hard to eat since there's no soup.

839
01:04:17,730 --> 01:04:20,300
No, it's okay. I'll eat.

840
01:04:20,300 --> 01:04:22,410
Let me get you some hot water.

841
01:04:23,110 --> 01:04:28,280
♫  It seemed that time did bend  ♫

842
01:04:28,280 --> 01:04:33,430
♫  And things were simple then  ♫

843
01:04:33,430 --> 01:04:39,580
♫  And since they've always been  ♫

844
01:04:39,580 --> 01:04:43,790
♫  Since I've loved you  ♫

845
01:04:44,690 --> 01:04:49,870
♫  Standing here all alone  ♫

846
01:04:49,870 --> 01:04:53,940
♫  Trying to be seen  ♫

847
01:04:54,940 --> 01:05:04,450
♫  Chasing whatever they might call a dream  ♫

848
01:05:05,240 --> 01:05:10,210
♫  But you came after all  ♫

849
01:05:10,210 --> 01:05:14,400
♫  Said look away  ♫

850
01:05:15,500 --> 01:05:20,650
♫  And things were simple then  ♫

851
01:05:20,650 --> 01:05:25,720
♫  Just like they've always been  ♫

852
01:05:25,720 --> 01:05:31,980
♫  Will our love ever end  ♫

853
01:05:33,340 --> 01:05:36,970
♫  I'll never know  ♫

854
01:05:47,280 --> 01:05:49,630
It's cold. Go inside.

855
01:05:50,250 --> 01:05:51,990
Call me if you can't sleep.

856
01:05:51,990 --> 01:05:54,440
I'm sorry I couldn't do the dishes.

857
01:05:54,440 --> 01:05:56,700
Don't worry about stuff like that.

858
01:06:03,560 --> 01:06:05,140
I'll go.

859
01:06:08,300 --> 01:06:09,940
Thank you.

860
01:06:11,350 --> 01:06:13,060
Bye.

861
01:08:35,020 --> 01:08:44,050


862
01:08:50,410 --> 01:08:52,340
Hold on.

863
01:08:52,340 --> 01:08:54,500
Wh-Where are you going?

864
01:08:55,450 --> 01:08:59,540
Did... Did you leave something?

865
01:08:59,540 --> 01:09:01,400
No.

866
01:09:03,160 --> 01:09:04,720
What is it, then?

867
01:09:07,110 --> 01:09:10,630
I didn't get to tell you something. You?

868
01:09:12,950 --> 01:09:15,280
I just wanted to ask you something.

869
01:09:16,370 --> 01:09:18,090
What is it?

870
01:09:19,610 --> 01:09:21,440
You go first.

871
01:09:24,970 --> 01:09:28,210
- Should we go home?
 - No, it won't take long.

872
01:09:30,800 --> 01:09:32,400
I...

873
01:09:33,570 --> 01:09:35,320
am okay.

874
01:09:37,470 --> 01:09:40,540
I wanted to tell you that I'm okay.

875
01:09:40,540 --> 01:09:42,980
Don't worry about me and go to sleep.

876
01:09:43,810 --> 01:09:46,490
How about you? What did you want to ask?

877
01:09:49,440 --> 01:09:51,620
It's nothing serious.

878
01:09:51,620 --> 01:09:55,320
I just wanted to ask if you were okay.

879
01:10:00,390 --> 01:10:03,360
- Let's go. I'll drop you off—
 - No, I have another thing...

880
01:10:03,360 --> 01:10:05,010
to tell you.

881
01:10:14,560 --> 01:10:17,360
- By chance—
 - That I love you.

882
01:10:21,610 --> 01:10:23,780
You said

883
01:10:23,780 --> 01:10:26,500
I can just say I love you.

884
01:10:29,730 --> 01:10:31,470
Things...

885
01:10:32,830 --> 01:10:36,040
will be very hard starting tomorrow and...

886
01:10:36,040 --> 01:10:39,170
I'm telling you this...

887
01:10:40,090 --> 01:10:42,070
in a moment...

888
01:10:42,770 --> 01:10:44,620
like this-

889
01:10:45,420 --> 01:10:50,980
♫  Not everything is passing  —

890
01:10:51,840 --> 01:10:58,810
♫  Sometimes a chance will come again  ♫

891
01:10:58,810 --> 01:11:03,420
♫  A real love is lasting  ♫

892
01:11:03,420 --> 01:11:07,130
♫  I know it now,  ♫

893
01:11:09,980 --> 01:11:13,100
♫  I knew it then  ♫

894
01:11:14,040 --> 01:11:25,330
♫  For once in my life I think I'm finally going to make it right  ♫

895
01:11:25,330 --> 01:11:27,710
♫  Years ago, I let you  ♫

896
01:11:27,710 --> 01:11:31,630
 The Midnight Romance in Hagwon 

897
01:11:31,630 --> 01:11:33,880
 You want to blatantly act as a pair now? 

898
01:11:33,880 --> 01:11:36,360
 We did nothing wrong. There's no reason to run away, either. 

899
01:11:36,360 --> 01:11:40,000
 Mr. Lee is a difficult person to control. 

900
01:11:40,000 --> 01:11:41,940
 I'm just trying to take what's mine. 

901
01:11:41,940 --> 01:11:45,610
 - Help me.
 - You changed so much now that you're in danger. 

902
01:11:45,610 --> 01:11:47,180
 Wow, you piece of trash... 

903
01:11:47,180 --> 01:11:50,590
 Are you saying you aren't seeing your student? 

904
01:11:51,290 --> 01:11:54,890
 Seo Hye Jin. It's a shame. 

905
01:11:54,890 --> 01:11:57,580
 I've never felt so scared in my life. 

906
01:11:57,580 --> 01:12:03,330
 Love me even more the best you can.
