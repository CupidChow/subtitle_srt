I don't it's a consultation.

8
00:00:55,789 --> 00:00:58,230
He said you'd know the name Pyo Sang Seob.

9
00:01:02,700 --> 00:01:03,800
Is something up?

10
00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:06,730
Yes.

11
00:01:07,429 --> 00:01:09,270
Someone's here to see me.

12
00:01:10,839 --> 00:01:11,970
Ms. Seo.

13
00:01:12,369 --> 00:01:14,979
Mr. Pyo Sang Seob's here. Do you know why...

14
00:01:15,140 --> 00:01:16,280
He's here to see me.

15
00:01:52,979 --> 00:01:54,280
It has been a while.

16
00:01:56,020 --> 00:01:57,020
Yes.

17
00:01:58,050 --> 00:02:00,490
It has been a while, Mr. Pyo.

19
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:05,190
Pyo Sang Seob.

20
00:02:06,130 --> 00:02:07,190
Pyo Sang Seob?

21
00:02:08,530 --> 00:02:09,959
I heard that name before.

22
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:15,440
Wait.

23
00:02:17,710 --> 00:02:18,710
Oh, gosh.

24
00:02:21,940 --> 00:02:23,109
Please take a seat.

25
00:02:56,479 --> 00:02:59,079
What's going on? Don't you even knock...

26
00:03:01,949 --> 00:03:03,150
What are you doing?

27
00:03:06,850 --> 00:03:08,819
Shoot. I can't hear a word.

28
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:14,130
I just don't know what he's here about.

29
00:03:27,009 --> 00:03:29,680
There's no need to be too nervous.

30
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:32,380
I just came by to say hello.

31
00:03:34,419 --> 00:03:35,819
That makes me even more nervous.

32
00:03:35,949 --> 00:03:39,250
I don't think we were close enough to say hello.

33
00:03:39,889 --> 00:03:41,090
We met...

34
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:43,620
after the mid-term, right?

35
00:03:46,530 --> 00:03:47,829
Once in the school teachers' office,

36
00:03:49,299 --> 00:03:51,600
and then at a Japanese restaurant.

37
00:03:53,329 --> 00:03:54,639
We met twice.

38
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:56,870
Yes.

39
00:03:57,669 --> 00:03:58,810
Since then,

40
00:04:01,039 --> 00:04:03,440
I felt like we were always together.

41
00:04:04,449 --> 00:04:05,750
As teachers.

42
00:04:09,350 --> 00:04:10,549
But please excuse me...

43
00:04:11,090 --> 00:04:13,519
I can't bring myself to refer to you as a teacher.

44
00:04:15,519 --> 00:04:18,590
Are you surprised I called you a teacher?

45
00:04:21,059 --> 00:04:22,460
Yes. A bit.

46
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:25,030
I should apologize first.

47
00:04:27,129 --> 00:04:29,070
You really never know where life will take you.

48
00:04:31,039 --> 00:04:32,410
I was too rash.

49
00:04:38,379 --> 00:04:41,479
I didn't think I'd throw in the towel.

50
00:04:46,619 --> 00:04:49,059
Do you not get what I mean?

51
00:04:50,689 --> 00:04:53,559
I don't. Can you explain so I do?

52
00:04:53,789 --> 00:04:57,330
Why did you feel like we were always together?

53
00:04:57,770 --> 00:04:59,830
And what's this about throwing in the towel?

54
00:05:03,539 --> 00:05:04,910
I quit as a schoolteacher.

55
00:05:08,539 --> 00:05:10,479
To be more exact, I submitted my resignation.

56
00:05:13,010 --> 00:05:14,520
There still are some formalities.

57
00:05:15,950 --> 00:05:17,989
The Office of Education and principal must approve.

58
00:05:18,220 --> 00:05:19,390
It's a complicated process.

59
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:23,559
What did you just say?

60
00:05:24,119 --> 00:05:25,530
I'm sorry, I mean...

61
00:05:28,859 --> 00:05:30,859
What are you saying?

62
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:33,299
I mean why...

63
00:05:34,330 --> 00:05:36,400
Why did you make that decision?

64
00:05:36,970 --> 00:05:38,839
It's a bit awkward to say...

65
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:40,939
I made the decision.

66
00:05:41,510 --> 00:05:42,580
I just wonder...

67
00:05:45,510 --> 00:05:47,749
if it were meant to be this way.

68
00:05:48,879 --> 00:05:50,549
- Is this about... - Yes.

69
00:05:52,249 --> 00:05:54,890
Ever since that day in the teachers' office.

70
00:05:58,289 --> 00:05:59,330
I need you...

71
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:01,960
to explain in detail so I get it.

72
00:06:03,760 --> 00:06:06,700
Did you go over our final exam?

73
00:06:07,900 --> 00:06:10,539
- Yes. - How did you find it?

74
00:06:10,999 --> 00:06:13,009
Why would you ask me that?

75
00:06:13,010 --> 00:06:15,210
I don't exist to evaluate school exams.

76
00:06:22,850 --> 00:06:25,090
"Chanyoung High's exams are always well thought-out."

77
00:06:27,619 --> 00:06:29,359
"The options were quite refreshing."

78
00:06:30,419 --> 00:06:31,460
Isn't that...

79
00:06:32,530 --> 00:06:34,229
what you said?

80
00:06:35,830 --> 00:06:36,960
Don't you remember?

81
00:06:37,460 --> 00:06:41,439
I said that to mean I understood the intention behind the question.

82
00:06:42,070 --> 00:06:43,140
I see.

83
00:06:48,280 --> 00:06:49,640
Ever since...

84
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:54,179
you paid a visit to my school,

85
00:06:55,080 --> 00:06:56,080
I became...

86
00:06:58,189 --> 00:06:59,520
a mess.

87
00:07:01,390 --> 00:07:03,960
I said I'd show you the strength of public education...

88
00:07:04,189 --> 00:07:05,960
that an academy could never infringe upon.

89
00:07:07,229 --> 00:07:08,660
That thought poisoned me.

90
00:07:10,260 --> 00:07:11,330
After that day,

91
00:07:11,869 --> 00:07:14,030
academies were all I could think about.

92
00:07:15,070 --> 00:07:17,439
"How do academies teach this passage?"

93
00:07:18,970 --> 00:07:22,080
"Do academies teach this as a whole?"

94
00:07:23,479 --> 00:07:26,580
"Would academies think this question was well thought-out?"

95
00:07:28,580 --> 00:07:30,780
Academies, academies...

96
00:07:32,789 --> 00:07:33,820
Academies.

97
00:07:39,129 --> 00:07:40,129
I guess...

98
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:44,160
that's why it felt like I taught my students with you...

99
00:07:44,559 --> 00:07:46,770
for the rest of the semester.

100
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:52,169
I'm quite stupid for realizing that only now.

101
00:07:54,070 --> 00:07:56,679
You didn't have to resign over that.

102
00:07:59,109 --> 00:08:02,619
Did you hear what I told the students after that?

103
00:08:03,950 --> 00:08:06,150
That's you'd use passages from the textbook.

104
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:08,589
Zero related passages.

105
00:08:08,590 --> 00:08:09,760
Short essay questions.

106
00:08:10,090 --> 00:08:11,789
That was the exam guideline.

107
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:13,689
Did you hear the reason...

108
00:08:14,429 --> 00:08:15,460
for those guidelines?

109
00:08:15,729 --> 00:08:18,570
No, I didn't get to hear that.

110
00:08:20,669 --> 00:08:21,840
You wouldn't have.

111
00:08:24,140 --> 00:08:25,669
Because I never got to explain.

112
00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:29,479
I had prepared a fancy speech...

113
00:08:30,179 --> 00:08:31,450
to give to whoever...

114
00:08:32,010 --> 00:08:33,450
asked me about it.

115
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:36,649
What it means...

116
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:39,350
to read through and master the textbook.

117
00:08:40,619 --> 00:08:43,889
What it is that I want to teach the students.

118
00:08:47,259 --> 00:08:49,229
But no one asked.

119
00:08:51,399 --> 00:08:53,570
The ill-tempered lashings out of a teacher...

120
00:08:54,769 --> 00:08:56,200
who was humiliated...

121
00:08:57,570 --> 00:08:58,609
by an academy instructor.

122
00:09:00,269 --> 00:09:01,779
That was all it became.

123
00:09:08,149 --> 00:09:09,379
I'm not offended.

124
00:09:09,879 --> 00:09:11,050
If I think about it,

125
00:09:13,350 --> 00:09:15,190
I wasn't entirely innocent or naive.

126
00:09:23,259 --> 00:09:25,498
Whether it's a class or an exam question,

127
00:09:25,499 --> 00:09:28,070
for a teacher to doubt... No.

128
00:09:29,239 --> 00:09:31,470
To verify themselves.

129
00:09:33,909 --> 00:09:35,040
I think...

130
00:09:36,739 --> 00:09:38,180
that's a must.

131
00:09:38,350 --> 00:09:40,210
Yes. It is.

132
00:09:43,050 --> 00:09:44,249
However,

133
00:09:48,790 --> 00:09:49,989
I'm ruined.

134
00:09:52,759 --> 00:09:54,159
The students...

135
00:09:56,159 --> 00:09:57,659
and teachers...

136
00:10:00,700 --> 00:10:01,899
consider me a time bomb.

137
00:10:05,540 --> 00:10:07,369
About the mid-term question.

138
00:10:08,580 --> 00:10:11,239
I didn't lodge a complaint through a board meeting...

139
00:10:12,279 --> 00:10:13,409
On the outside,

140
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:16,080
it was to handle it quickly.

141
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:19,090
But on the inside...

142
00:10:21,420 --> 00:10:24,790
Wasn't it a rumor that you wanted?

143
00:10:27,590 --> 00:10:29,700
For no one but yourself.

144
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:36,239
That's the conclusion...

145
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:40,009
I reached after looking back on that day hundreds of times.

146
00:10:41,979 --> 00:10:43,778
If you had admitted from the start...

147
00:10:43,779 --> 00:10:45,478
that there were two possible answers...

148
00:10:45,479 --> 00:10:46,550
Then...

149
00:10:47,479 --> 00:10:50,550
the students and parents alike would consider you...

150
00:10:51,119 --> 00:10:52,290
a hero.

151
00:10:54,149 --> 00:10:56,359
Even if the fight were to snowball...

152
00:10:58,629 --> 00:10:59,690
Even if...

153
00:11:00,029 --> 00:11:02,259
you didn't get what you wanted, it would've still worked for you.

154
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:06,330
You'd be called a fighter...

155
00:11:07,269 --> 00:11:08,840
who took on a school.

156
00:11:11,940 --> 00:11:12,970
In other words,

157
00:11:14,369 --> 00:11:15,639
you had...

158
00:11:17,310 --> 00:11:20,680
two outcomes which were both favorable.

159
00:11:22,249 --> 00:11:23,279
And I...

160
00:11:26,019 --> 00:11:27,090
was trapped.

161
00:11:30,389 --> 00:11:32,060
I heard that in the academy world,

162
00:11:33,259 --> 00:11:35,629
what instructors need the most are rumors.

163
00:11:37,759 --> 00:11:40,170
And rumors are also the most dangerous.

164
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:45,009
The rumor that you bashed into someone's fortress.

165
00:11:45,540 --> 00:11:47,310
And we want the one in power to be angry.

166
00:11:48,180 --> 00:11:50,310
Anger will turn to interest,

167
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:53,180
and that'll become a value that can't be measured by money.

168
00:12:03,259 --> 00:12:04,290
Yes?

169
00:12:20,210 --> 00:12:22,180
No one's allowed to come in.

170
00:12:23,909 --> 00:12:26,279
- Ms. Seo. - Leave, Mr. Lee Jun Ho.

171
00:12:31,749 --> 00:12:32,820
I see.

172
00:12:33,389 --> 00:12:36,290
Is this the Lee Jun Ho?

173
00:12:43,960 --> 00:12:45,269
I heard a lot about you.

174
00:12:46,170 --> 00:12:47,229
I'm Pyo Sang Seob.

175
00:12:49,570 --> 00:12:50,970
Hello.

176
00:12:53,210 --> 00:12:54,409
Starting with this winter break,

177
00:12:56,239 --> 00:12:58,040
I will work at Choisun Academy.

178
00:13:03,379 --> 00:13:04,550
Mr. Lee.

179
00:13:05,989 --> 00:13:07,749
I'd wanted to meet you too,

180
00:13:08,019 --> 00:13:10,389
but would you mind if today...

181
00:13:11,019 --> 00:13:12,659
I speak just with Ms. Seo?

182
00:13:14,430 --> 00:13:16,060
Sure, that's fine.

183
00:13:16,830 --> 00:13:18,060
I'll leave you to talk.

184
00:13:25,840 --> 00:13:27,810
(Consultation Room 2)

185
00:13:36,519 --> 00:13:37,550
What's going on?

186
00:13:38,690 --> 00:13:40,519
I don't know.

187
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:42,119
He's from Choisun Academy.

188
00:13:42,859 --> 00:13:44,460
What do you mean? He's Chanyoung High's...

189
00:13:46,989 --> 00:13:48,090
Oh, my gosh.

190
00:13:48,859 --> 00:13:50,759
It's because of what she did.

191
00:13:52,229 --> 00:13:53,330
What did she do?

192
00:13:53,430 --> 00:13:54,600
Don't you remember?

193
00:13:55,970 --> 00:13:57,869
The new instructors don't know.

194
00:13:57,999 --> 00:14:01,109
We hired them after the mid-term exam.

195
00:14:02,779 --> 00:14:03,909
Do you think...

196
00:14:05,310 --> 00:14:07,649
I'll be able to start my career as an instructor...

197
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:10,720
with a crazy rumor?

198
00:14:13,550 --> 00:14:15,720
Would there be a point in apologizing...

199
00:14:16,759 --> 00:14:17,790
Why apologize?

200
00:14:19,690 --> 00:14:20,889
If it hadn't been for that,

201
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:24,159
I'd never have realized.

202
00:14:25,330 --> 00:14:27,430
- You are... - What it means to help the kids.

203
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:32,540
What teaching Korean is really about. To be honest,

204
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:38,409
it's possible I didn't even care about that.

205
00:14:40,180 --> 00:14:41,210
I thought...

206
00:14:43,779 --> 00:14:46,419
you had more pride and self-respect...

207
00:14:46,420 --> 00:14:48,590
than anyone as a schoolteacher.

208
00:14:49,159 --> 00:14:52,029
Your students must respect you a lot.

209
00:14:53,290 --> 00:14:54,930
That's what I believed.

210
00:14:59,869 --> 00:15:01,570
I saw something interesting in your lobby.

211
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:05,570
The Hall of Fame.

212
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:08,909
Could there be anything...

213
00:15:09,710 --> 00:15:11,979
that boosts your pride and honor...

214
00:15:12,710 --> 00:15:15,350
as sending more students to a top university?

215
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:19,289
Sending our students to a good university...

216
00:15:19,290 --> 00:15:20,920
is our pride and joy.

217
00:15:21,220 --> 00:15:22,989
- Let's work together. - Let's work together.

218
00:15:32,529 --> 00:15:33,899
How did you choose Choisun Academy?

219
00:15:34,300 --> 00:15:35,540
I was made an offer.

220
00:15:36,739 --> 00:15:37,940
I was surprised too.

221
00:15:38,470 --> 00:15:39,769
I didn't expect...

222
00:15:39,909 --> 00:15:41,810
a Daechi-dong academy to want a has-been like me.

223
00:15:43,310 --> 00:15:45,509
The work will be much harder than you think.

224
00:15:46,249 --> 00:15:47,279
Why?

225
00:15:47,950 --> 00:15:49,979
Do you think I'll send fewer students...

226
00:15:50,220 --> 00:15:51,519
to university than you?

227
00:15:51,619 --> 00:15:54,090
No, that's not what I meant.

228
00:16:00,460 --> 00:16:01,529
I regret it.

229
00:16:02,899 --> 00:16:04,300
It might have been nicer...

230
00:16:06,470 --> 00:16:08,229
if I'd joined this industry sooner.

231
00:16:09,899 --> 00:16:11,239
I feel so free,

232
00:16:13,009 --> 00:16:16,109
and I could've enjoyed the luxury of money for longer.

233
00:16:26,019 --> 00:16:27,019
"Parasite."

234
00:16:29,759 --> 00:16:32,029
That's what you called us academy instructors.

235
00:16:36,060 --> 00:16:37,060
That hurts.

236
00:16:41,700 --> 00:16:43,040
You looked so nonchalant then,

237
00:16:44,670 --> 00:16:46,239
I didn't think it hurt you.

238
00:16:47,269 --> 00:16:49,109
That was because I thought hearing such insults...

239
00:16:50,340 --> 00:16:52,950
was part of my job of improving kids' grades.

240
00:16:53,350 --> 00:16:56,279
I guess you must put up with that kind of hurt here.

241
00:17:00,790 --> 00:17:01,889
I learned something today.

242
00:17:02,619 --> 00:17:05,960
I met Choisun Academy's director, Choi Hyung Sun too.

243
00:17:07,129 --> 00:17:08,560
As good as the offer is,

244
00:17:08,659 --> 00:17:11,000
she'll demand a great performance.

245
00:17:11,429 --> 00:17:12,869
If you're that concerned,

246
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:17,770
will you send over some of your Chanyoung High students?

247
00:17:30,719 --> 00:17:31,919
Yes, hello.

248
00:17:37,419 --> 00:17:40,159
I took the day off to be somewhere.

249
00:17:43,800 --> 00:17:46,500
No, you don't have to.

250
00:17:50,070 --> 00:17:51,240
If you insist...

251
00:17:53,139 --> 00:17:54,240
Yes, I know the place.

252
00:17:56,580 --> 00:17:57,580
Yes.

253
00:17:59,879 --> 00:18:01,879
Okay. I understand. Bye.

254
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:11,020
The Chanyoung High students...

255
00:18:12,060 --> 00:18:15,260
won't flock to my class from the start, will they?

256
00:18:18,230 --> 00:18:21,070
But I want to teach them...

257
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,869
in my own way.

258
00:18:26,609 --> 00:18:28,609
What must I do to win them over?

259
00:18:30,580 --> 00:18:32,850
I suggested we do a free lecture.

260
00:18:33,010 --> 00:18:34,280
It'll be a huge affair.

261
00:18:35,750 --> 00:18:37,649
Discuss that with your director.

262
00:18:40,490 --> 00:18:43,189
Yes. I guess I should.

263
00:18:46,359 --> 00:18:47,590
I heard...

264
00:18:48,429 --> 00:18:51,030
you taught many Chanyoung High students.

265
00:18:53,369 --> 00:18:55,100
So I came to ask for advice.

266
00:18:57,899 --> 00:19:00,740
But something urgent just came up.

267
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:18,929
I won't go far.

268
00:19:24,359 --> 00:19:26,830
(Consultation Room 2)

269
00:19:36,740 --> 00:19:37,810
I hope...

270
00:19:38,649 --> 00:19:41,480
we can have the meal you took a rain check on.

271
00:20:05,409 --> 00:20:06,939
- No way. - Goodness.

272
00:20:06,969 --> 00:20:08,310
That's cute enough.

273
00:20:08,570 --> 00:20:09,679
Going up.

274
00:20:12,580 --> 00:20:13,879
The doors are closing.

275
00:20:14,209 --> 00:20:15,280
What's going on?

276
00:20:15,919 --> 00:20:16,979
Wasn't that Mr. Pyo?

277
00:20:16,980 --> 00:20:18,719
- That was Korean Pyo, right? - Yes.

278
00:20:19,020 --> 00:20:20,520
What was he doing here?

279
00:20:34,830 --> 00:20:37,398
We won't schedule a test for the regular students.

280
00:20:37,399 --> 00:20:38,539
Announce we'll split them into classes...

281
00:20:38,540 --> 00:20:40,408
based on their mock exam results.

282
00:20:40,409 --> 00:20:41,439
Okay.

Send in med school class teachers Gu In Hui and Cheon Soo Yeon.

285
00:20:51,379 --> 00:20:53,688
I want to go over questions for the future 10th-graders.

286
00:20:53,689 --> 00:20:54,719
Okay.

287
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:58,159
And schedule a dinner with Lee Sang Hyeon.

288
00:20:58,419 --> 00:21:00,490
I'll tell him we won't extend his contract.

289
00:21:00,530 --> 00:21:03,560
He might refuse to join you for dinner.

290
00:21:04,429 --> 00:21:07,500
He seems to know his contract won't be extended.

291
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,800
He's already scheduling special classes...

292
00:21:09,899 --> 00:21:11,969
in Pyeongchon and Jukjeon.

(Seo Hye Jin)

294
00:21:19,310 --> 00:21:20,510
It's Seo Hye Jin.

295
00:21:21,010 --> 00:21:22,219
Can we meet?

296
00:21:23,719 --> 00:21:26,490
Invite Lee Sang Hyeon to dinner just once.

297
00:21:26,719 --> 00:21:29,859
If he doesn't know how hard it is to eat with me,

298
00:21:30,719 --> 00:21:32,659
that's the extent of his perception.

299
00:21:53,980 --> 00:21:55,050
Why are you staring at me?

300
00:21:55,919 --> 00:21:57,050
Aren't you worried?

301
00:21:59,219 --> 00:22:00,219
Not really.

302
00:22:01,649 --> 00:22:03,290
I think this is pretty serious.

303
00:22:04,990 --> 00:22:07,159
It didn't look like Ms. Seo would lose to him.

304
00:22:08,830 --> 00:22:11,129
Do you think this is about winning or losing?

305
00:22:11,959 --> 00:22:13,969
He's just trying to start a childish fight.

306
00:22:14,169 --> 00:22:16,040
He must've wanted to get into her head,

307
00:22:16,270 --> 00:22:18,199
but he won't even get a tooth into Ms. Seo.

308
00:22:21,070 --> 00:22:22,070
Right.

309
00:22:22,609 --> 00:22:25,040
The friend of mine that you met. The post-grad student.

310
00:22:25,810 --> 00:22:28,050
He wants your number. Can I give it to him?

311
00:22:28,820 --> 00:22:29,850
No.

312
00:22:29,919 --> 00:22:31,949
Don't give it out unless it's a student or a mom.

313
00:22:33,389 --> 00:22:34,419
Understood.

315
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:05,590
Don't be like this.

316

You don't have to.

317
00:23:10,719 --> 00:23:13,629
If you quit like this, how would it make me look?

318
00:23:15,490 --> 00:23:16,730
I'm sorry.

319
00:23:18,359 --> 00:23:20,429
I lost control when I saw how many kids had gotten...

320
00:23:21,530 --> 00:23:22,800
all the multiple-choice questions right.

321
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:28,010
I shouldn't have talked like that to you.

322
00:23:28,980 --> 00:23:30,040
You suffered a lot...

323
00:23:30,879 --> 00:23:33,649

All the senior and supervising teachers...

330
00:23:52,770 --> 00:23:54,429
chewed me out.

There's nothing...

332
00:24:02,310 --> 00:24:04,580
I can do for you about that.

That's not what I'm asking.

what you teach...

336
00:24:14,090 --> 00:24:16,119

want to become a teacher?

she's not at all interested in you.

00:26:16,540 --> 00:26:17,609
I'll retake the KSAT.

372
00:26:21,209 --> 00:26:22,250
To go to med school?

373
00:26:27,320 --> 00:26:28,320
Good for you.

374
00:26:29,560 --> 00:26:31,290
- How about a coffee? - Sounds good.

375
00:26:34,230 --> 00:26:35,330
Are you in shock?

376
00:26:36,429 --> 00:26:37,560
Yes, a bit.

377
00:26:41,500 --> 00:26:43,070
I'm more amused and excited.

378
00:26:45,969 --> 00:26:48,709
What should we plan this time? My heart's pounding.

379
00:26:50,179 --> 00:26:52,108
He doesn't look like much of a striker,

380
00:26:52,109 --> 00:26:53,750
but I don't let my guard down.

381
00:26:56,980 --> 00:26:57,980
What did you say?

382
00:26:59,020 --> 00:27:00,090
That teacher.

383
00:27:00,750 --> 00:27:02,349
Choisun Academy seems to think...

384
00:27:02,350 --> 00:27:03,689
he's their hidden card,

385
00:27:04,159 --> 00:27:05,290
but he's no big deal.

386
00:27:07,459 --> 00:27:08,530
Do you not know?

387
00:27:09,560 --> 00:27:10,629
Know what?

388
00:27:11,330 --> 00:27:12,429
Well...

389
00:27:15,969 --> 00:27:18,300
There was an issue in the last mid-term.

390
00:27:19,939 --> 00:27:22,340
You went to the school and demanded another exam.

391
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:25,310
You knew.

392
00:27:25,679 --> 00:27:27,179
Our counselor told me.

393
00:27:27,679 --> 00:27:29,980
And I thought you did what you would do.

394
00:27:30,350 --> 00:27:32,490
Did you hear the full story?

395
00:27:33,149 --> 00:27:34,719
And you're still saying that?

396
00:27:36,590 --> 00:27:39,529
He quit his job as a teacher because of that.

397
00:27:39,530 --> 00:27:40,629
Well...

398
00:27:41,689 --> 00:27:44,428
I get the feeling there's no direct correlation,

399
00:27:44,429 --> 00:27:46,500
but even if there were,

400
00:27:47,399 --> 00:27:50,139
shouldn't that Pyo guy be bowing to you with thanks?

401
00:27:51,669 --> 00:27:53,939
He looked old enough to have at least 20 years experience.

402
00:27:54,270 --> 00:27:56,409
Do you think it's easy to get such an offer at his age?

403
00:27:57,179 --> 00:27:59,850
He had his own belief and philosophy.

404
00:28:00,609 --> 00:28:02,679
He had pride in the fact he chose...

405
00:28:02,820 --> 00:28:04,419
his career in high school.

406
00:28:13,030 --> 00:28:15,159
I'd wanted to ask this when I started here.

407
00:28:17,060 --> 00:28:20,029
Why are you so determined to devalue your own job?

408
00:28:20,030 --> 00:28:22,168
No, I'm not devaluing my job.

409
00:28:22,169 --> 00:28:23,469
Kids who give up.

410
00:28:24,540 --> 00:28:25,908
The first thing they give up on...

411
00:28:25,909 --> 00:28:27,469
are their school classes.

412
00:28:28,869 --> 00:28:32,209
What do you think schoolteachers teach...

413
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:35,209
that makes them so special while you talk...

414
00:28:35,250 --> 00:28:37,919
as if we have no value at all?

415
00:28:38,219 --> 00:28:40,089
He taught in schools for a long time.

416
00:28:40,090 --> 00:28:41,350
And he's that much older.

417
00:28:41,449 --> 00:28:43,260
How could he survive in an academy?

418
00:28:44,520 --> 00:28:45,790
Are you devaluing schools?

419
00:28:46,859 --> 00:28:48,759
As a place you can survive at...

420
00:28:48,760 --> 00:28:50,000
if you just have a belief?

421
00:28:52,969 --> 00:28:55,468
The point isn't where you teach.

422
00:28:55,469 --> 00:28:57,840
Isn't it who sends more kids to better universities?

423
00:28:58,139 --> 00:28:59,169
That's enough.

424
00:29:00,209 --> 00:29:01,270
Ms. Seo.

425
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:04,378
Don't pile on the guilt that you don't deserve...

426
00:29:04,379 --> 00:29:05,879
and relax and teach.

427
00:29:09,080 --> 00:29:10,520
Come to my place after work.

428
00:29:11,119 --> 00:29:13,149
No. We're not on the same page.

429
00:29:22,359 --> 00:29:23,359
What?

430
00:29:25,359 --> 00:29:26,368
Why not?

431
00:29:26,369 --> 00:29:29,239
Choisun Academy was always famous...

432
00:29:29,240 --> 00:29:31,369
for hiring ex-schoolteachers from the area.

433
00:29:32,810 --> 00:29:35,439
This is an unusual case.

434
00:29:37,139 --> 00:29:40,209
Ms. Choi took a slight peek.

435
00:29:41,250 --> 00:29:43,418
She said he was nicely dressed...

436
00:29:43,419 --> 00:29:45,580
and looked pretty normal.

437
00:29:45,949 --> 00:29:48,019
But I don't think the students...

438
00:29:48,020 --> 00:29:49,959
will go for a teacher like him.

439
00:29:51,020 --> 00:29:52,929
He's an older man which is what students...

440
00:29:53,189 --> 00:29:55,260
and parents like the least.

441
00:29:56,530 --> 00:29:57,530
And he caused...

442
00:29:57,531 --> 00:30:00,369
quite an issue at Chanyoung High.

443
00:30:03,669 --> 00:30:05,069
The White Haired Witch...

444
00:30:05,070 --> 00:30:07,969
wouldn't make such a move unless she weighed things out.

445
00:30:16,949 --> 00:30:19,020
(Daechi Chase)

446
00:30:48,909 --> 00:30:51,250
Ms. Yeon Joo, hi.

447
00:30:52,020 --> 00:30:53,520
It's been a while. Have you been well?

448
00:30:54,649 --> 00:30:56,859
Me? My days are pretty much the same.

449
00:30:57,619 --> 00:30:59,290
Is your child growing up well?

450
00:31:02,590 --> 00:31:04,799
Cooing over your child is one thing, but you should get back to work...

451
00:31:04,800 --> 00:31:05,959
before you lose your touch.

452
00:31:07,730 --> 00:31:09,899
Right. Well,

453
00:31:10,040 --> 00:31:11,399
it's no big deal,

454
00:31:12,270 --> 00:31:13,810
but can you get me someone's phone number...

455
00:31:14,909 --> 00:31:16,040
and keep it between us?

456
00:32:13,969 --> 00:32:15,829
The mother's back is part of her body...

457
00:32:15,830 --> 00:32:18,500
which is why honorifics were used indirectly.

458
00:32:19,139 --> 00:32:20,840
That concludes today's class.

459
00:32:23,510 --> 00:32:26,550
The empty seats bring us back to reality, doesn't it?

460
00:32:27,879 --> 00:32:29,649
Let's applaud ourselves for the good work we did.

461
00:32:33,350 --> 00:32:36,419
I hope many of you enrolled in my special lecture for the vacation.

462
00:32:36,560 --> 00:32:37,689
- Yes. - Yes.

463
00:32:38,159 --> 00:32:39,959
Also, who here will take additional classes...

464
00:32:40,429 --> 00:32:41,959
in classical poetry?

465
00:32:44,929 --> 00:32:46,570
Check out Ms. Nam Cheong Mi's class.

466
00:32:47,429 --> 00:32:48,730
Who's Nam Cheong Mi?

467
00:32:49,129 --> 00:32:51,499
The new instructor here. I heard the rumors.

468
00:32:51,500 --> 00:32:52,969
I bet you haven't heard her...

469
00:32:53,040 --> 00:32:55,070
recite "Song of the Northeast" as a rap.

470
00:32:56,379 --> 00:32:58,679
Teach me how it goes after learning it.

471
00:32:58,740 --> 00:32:59,879
- Sure. - Sure.

472
00:33:00,350 --> 00:33:01,878
Right. Enjoy the last day of the semester,

473
00:33:01,879 --> 00:33:03,250
and I'll see you at my vacation lecture.

474
00:33:03,879 --> 00:33:06,189
Ms. Seo, Pyo Sang Seob...

475
00:33:07,750 --> 00:33:10,219
Is Mr. Pyo going to teach here?

476
00:33:10,619 --> 00:33:11,619
No.

477
00:33:11,959 --> 00:33:13,659
But I saw him earlier at the academy.

478
00:33:14,990 --> 00:33:17,530
That was for something else. Why do you ask?

479
00:33:17,800 --> 00:33:20,369
His classes are actually nice.

480
00:33:21,030 --> 00:33:23,500
He's not as humorous as you are,

481
00:33:23,740 --> 00:33:25,669
but I liked his after-school classes.

482
00:33:26,310 --> 00:33:27,409
- What? - Right?

483
00:33:27,840 --> 00:33:28,840
Yes.

484
00:33:29,010 --> 00:33:31,240
Ha Yul even filled in the reading notes.

485
00:33:31,409 --> 00:33:32,510
Stop it.

486
00:33:33,480 --> 00:33:35,909
Gosh. You're making me jealous.

487
00:33:35,980 --> 00:33:38,750
Don't be. You're the one we love.

488
00:33:55,699 --> 00:33:58,240
(Samseong-ro)

489
00:34:12,779 --> 00:34:15,049
Where are you? I'm waiting at the subway station.

490
00:34:16,659 --> 00:34:18,589
I don't want to meet up today, so head home.

491
00:34:19,159 --> 00:34:21,489
What... You can't just cancel on me.

492
00:34:21,889 --> 00:34:23,900
If there's a difference of opinion, we should talk it out.

493
00:34:24,130 --> 00:34:25,659
Through a healthy discussion...

494
00:34:26,159 --> 00:34:27,170
Hello?

495
00:34:32,440 --> 00:34:34,568
- What now? - Keep taking my call like that,

496
00:34:34,569 --> 00:34:36,040
and I'll show up at your house.

497
00:34:36,909 --> 00:34:37,980
Where are you?

498
00:34:41,449 --> 00:34:42,810
I'm on my way home.

499
00:34:43,219 --> 00:34:44,679
I thought about it.

500
00:34:45,219 --> 00:34:47,019
If you can't get me her phone number,

501
00:34:47,020 --> 00:34:48,219
setting up...

502
00:34:48,520 --> 00:34:50,719
a casual get-together like last time is also an option.

503
00:34:51,920 --> 00:34:54,630
I have something to say to her, that's all.

504
00:34:58,460 --> 00:34:59,500
What the...

505
00:35:01,830 --> 00:35:02,830
Wait.

506
00:35:07,270 --> 00:35:10,779
Shouldn't this usually happen between a man and a woman?

507
00:35:11,679 --> 00:35:12,810
Don't get me started.

508
00:35:34,100 --> 00:35:35,600
- Would you like to join me? - Really?

509
00:35:35,699 --> 00:35:37,270
- Are you buying? - Of course.

510
00:35:38,670 --> 00:35:39,710
Sounds like fun.

511
00:35:55,219 --> 00:35:56,489
It's Seo Hye Jin.

512
00:35:56,860 --> 00:35:59,389
I'm outside the academy. Can we talk for a bit?

513
00:36:00,830 --> 00:36:01,929
Please.

514
00:36:10,500 --> 00:36:13,409
(Daechi Choisun Academy)

515
00:36:21,110 --> 00:36:22,249
Thanks for the great meal.

516
00:36:22,250 --> 00:36:23,779
- Sure. Have a good one. - You too.

517
00:36:26,350 --> 00:36:27,389
Wait.

518
00:36:29,020 --> 00:36:30,060
What brings you to this place?

519
00:36:30,589 --> 00:36:33,429
I was hungry after class, so I grabbed a bowl of noodles.

520
00:36:33,960 --> 00:36:35,759
- Hello. - Yes, hello.

521
00:36:37,500 --> 00:36:38,630
What about Ms. Seo?

522
00:36:38,860 --> 00:36:40,199
Didn't you two get off work together?

523
00:36:40,369 --> 00:36:42,569
It just happened this way.

524
00:36:44,339 --> 00:36:45,500
I see. Then...

525
00:36:46,040 --> 00:36:47,969
- Enjoy your meal. - Sure.

526
00:36:50,080 --> 00:36:51,609
- Hi. - Hi.

527
00:36:51,610 --> 00:36:53,479
- Hello. - Hey. Call her back.

528
00:36:53,480 --> 00:36:54,949
- What? - This second!

529
00:36:55,110 --> 00:36:56,110
What...

530
00:36:58,049 --> 00:36:59,718
(Night Flight)

531
00:36:59,719 --> 00:37:01,920
- Ms. Nam, wait. - Yes?

532
00:37:02,290 --> 00:37:04,489
If you're not too busy, have a drink with us.

533
00:37:04,659 --> 00:37:06,428
- The bus will stop running. - Sure.

534
00:37:06,429 --> 00:37:07,529
Then I'll...

535
00:37:09,230 --> 00:37:10,759
I'll drive you home.

536
00:37:11,600 --> 00:37:12,600
With what car?

537
00:37:12,759 --> 00:37:14,500
My mom's.

538
00:37:31,679 --> 00:37:32,949
I was told to escort you up.

539
00:37:41,290 --> 00:37:44,130
So Mr. Pyo...

540
00:37:44,159 --> 00:37:45,860
It's Vice-director Pyo.

541
00:37:47,130 --> 00:37:50,440
When did you first meet with Vice-director Pyo?

542
00:37:52,139 --> 00:37:53,969
Aren't you here to talk to the director?

543
00:37:55,069 --> 00:37:56,310
You can ask her yourself.

544
00:37:57,679 --> 00:37:59,440
She's not someone you can meet easily,

545
00:38:00,250 --> 00:38:03,009
so I'd ask everything I could when I have the chance.

546
00:38:04,650 --> 00:38:05,679
Sure.

547
00:38:09,219 --> 00:38:10,219
By the way,

548
00:38:11,659 --> 00:38:14,560
is Lee Si Woo doing well?

549
00:38:15,330 --> 00:38:16,730
Yes, I guess.

550
00:38:20,170 --> 00:38:23,069
He's a tricky one, isn't he? He also speaks his mind.

551
00:38:26,739 --> 00:38:27,839
I see.

552
00:38:33,750 --> 00:38:34,750
Come in.

553
00:38:43,819 --> 00:38:45,489
Just a second.

554
00:39:17,159 --> 00:39:18,560
I apologize,

555
00:39:19,060 --> 00:39:21,230
but I have a lot to handle before the school semester ends.

556
00:39:22,190 --> 00:39:23,460
Did I make you wait long?

557
00:39:24,199 --> 00:39:25,429
Yes, you did.

558
00:39:26,600 --> 00:39:27,670
Please have a seat.

559
00:39:29,600 --> 00:39:31,600
I also apologize to you, Mr. Park,

560
00:39:31,739 --> 00:39:33,040
for keeping you around this late.

561
00:39:33,940 --> 00:39:36,339
Since you're here though, please wait around a while longer.

562
00:39:36,610 --> 00:39:38,380
This won't take long.

563
00:39:46,420 --> 00:39:47,690
Did you have...

564
00:39:48,250 --> 00:39:50,420
unfinished business with us?

565
00:39:52,259 --> 00:39:54,730
The empty office you showed me.

566
00:39:55,860 --> 00:39:56,960
The vice-director's office.

567
00:39:58,500 --> 00:40:00,429
Can I accept the offer?

568
00:40:02,130 --> 00:40:03,270
It's too bad,

569
00:40:03,839 --> 00:40:05,799
but we found the right person for the job recently.

570
00:40:08,139 --> 00:40:10,610
That was fast. It didn't take you very long.

571
00:40:12,009 --> 00:40:14,250
It would've been better to have you on board,

572
00:40:14,779 --> 00:40:16,049
but I'm quite satisfied with our recent choice.

573
00:40:22,089 --> 00:40:23,489
You seem to have...

574
00:40:23,790 --> 00:40:25,520
already met the man who occupies that office.

575
00:40:27,759 --> 00:40:30,929
It's too late into the night for silly riddles.

576
00:40:32,029 --> 00:40:34,429
I want to know why. Why him of all people?

577
00:40:35,230 --> 00:40:36,699
That's a rude question to ask...

578
00:40:37,440 --> 00:40:39,909
both me and the vice-director.

579
00:40:40,909 --> 00:40:41,939
What reason would I have...

580
00:40:41,940 --> 00:40:43,480
other than him being a great teacher?

581
00:40:46,580 --> 00:40:48,049
He should be teaching at a school.

582
00:40:52,080 --> 00:40:53,150
That...

583
00:40:54,290 --> 00:40:57,960
That side of you is what I like about you.

584
00:40:59,719 --> 00:41:03,159
When your own job is at stake, you turn into a wrecker...

585
00:41:04,159 --> 00:41:05,199
Sorry about that.

586
00:41:06,060 --> 00:41:09,069
You wield your sword like a true champion.

587
00:41:10,100 --> 00:41:12,170
But after you win your battle,

588
00:41:12,239 --> 00:41:14,170
you go back to being righteous.

589
00:41:16,239 --> 00:41:19,949
Not everyone can be as brazen as that.

590
00:41:22,779 --> 00:41:26,279
You truly are someone I wish to work with.

591
00:41:26,719 --> 00:41:28,219
During mid-terms...

592
00:41:28,319 --> 00:41:29,690
You hung Mr. Pyo...

593
00:41:30,159 --> 00:41:32,218
at the center of the teacher's office...

594
00:41:32,219 --> 00:41:34,360
and beat him to a pulp so to speak.

595
00:41:34,429 --> 00:41:37,299
In front of his colleagues, might I add.

596
00:41:38,259 --> 00:41:42,429
But now you say he should be teaching in school.

597
00:41:43,639 --> 00:41:47,139
That has to be the joke of the year for me.

598
00:41:50,839 --> 00:41:52,210
That was out of line.

599
00:41:52,339 --> 00:41:53,449
Was it?

600
00:41:55,779 --> 00:41:57,019
Before opening classes for Heewon High students,

601
00:41:57,020 --> 00:41:58,819
you tried to mess with me with the days you chose.

602
00:41:59,679 --> 00:42:02,048
Then, you plastered the streets of Daechi-dong...

603
00:42:02,049 --> 00:42:03,960
with ads that were obviously aimed at me.

604
00:42:04,460 --> 00:42:05,460
But what did you say...

605
00:42:05,889 --> 00:42:08,589
when you declined my offer to come work at this academy?

606
00:42:09,489 --> 00:42:11,130
What I want to say is,

607
00:42:11,830 --> 00:42:14,469
the reasoning for my decision has nothing to do...

608
00:42:15,199 --> 00:42:16,529
with what you offered.

609
00:42:25,839 --> 00:42:27,779
I'll remain at my current academy.

610
00:42:36,790 --> 00:42:40,060
Can you tell me the real reason?

611
00:42:40,759 --> 00:42:43,400
I want to teach Si Woo.

612
00:42:45,330 --> 00:42:46,600
He's a smart student.

613
00:42:47,369 --> 00:42:50,069
Wouldn't he take classes here if you chose to move?

614
00:42:50,400 --> 00:42:52,069
He gave up his scholarship...

615
00:42:52,440 --> 00:42:54,409
and chose to study at my current academy.

616
00:42:55,139 --> 00:42:57,210
I couldn't possibly tell him to come back here again.

617
00:42:58,210 --> 00:43:01,449
If he comes back, he'll have the same scholarship deal.

618
00:43:02,350 --> 00:43:03,449
If that's what he wants,

619
00:43:05,250 --> 00:43:06,580
I'll let him...

620
00:43:07,150 --> 00:43:08,850
take your class instead of mine.

621
00:43:12,159 --> 00:43:14,329
Moving academies might not seem like a big deal,

622
00:43:14,330 --> 00:43:17,360
but to someone as young as him, the decision must've been tough.

623
00:43:18,060 --> 00:43:20,100
And it required courage on his part.

624
00:43:20,969 --> 00:43:23,069
I couldn't possibly change my mind...

625
00:43:25,400 --> 00:43:26,639
and shatter his decision.

626
00:43:27,009 --> 00:43:30,079
At that moment, you sounded like the teacher...

627
00:43:30,080 --> 00:43:31,710
from "Dead Poets Society."

628
00:43:32,310 --> 00:43:35,409
What was his name again? Keating or Keaten?

629
00:43:36,009 --> 00:43:38,880
I'm asking why you offered Mr. Pyo the job.

630
00:43:38,949 --> 00:43:39,949
I don't deserve...

631
00:43:41,089 --> 00:43:42,388
your sarcasm.

632
00:43:42,389 --> 00:43:43,860
Don't think of it as sarcasm.

633
00:43:44,259 --> 00:43:45,460
I'll say it again,

634
00:43:45,719 --> 00:43:48,830
but that's what I liked about you.

635
00:43:50,960 --> 00:43:53,259
An educator but also a businesswoman.

636
00:43:54,369 --> 00:43:57,198
There aren't many people like you...

637
00:43:57,199 --> 00:44:00,469
who can blindly ignore the disjunction between the two.

638
00:44:04,310 --> 00:44:05,540
Mr. Pyo...

639
00:44:08,380 --> 00:44:09,509
shouldn't turn into...

640
00:44:11,420 --> 00:44:13,649
a wrecker like me.

641
00:44:13,650 --> 00:44:14,750
He's the one...

642
00:44:16,619 --> 00:44:18,889
who made this choice.

643
00:44:19,489 --> 00:44:21,060
All I did was make an offer.

644
00:44:22,690 --> 00:44:23,900
In that sense,

645
00:44:24,400 --> 00:44:27,369
aren't I more reasonable than you are?

646
00:44:28,670 --> 00:44:30,198
He's not on the younger side.

647
00:44:30,199 --> 00:44:32,068
If he fails to prove himself, he'll be at the edge of a cliff.

648
00:44:32,069 --> 00:44:34,039
Are you sure you don't want him to fail...

649
00:44:34,040 --> 00:44:36,110
since he might take Chanyoung High students from you?

650
00:44:36,409 --> 00:44:38,609
I may be a wrecker, but not one that cruel.

651
00:44:38,610 --> 00:44:39,610
Or...

652
00:44:40,080 --> 00:44:41,809
could you still be...

653
00:44:41,810 --> 00:44:44,350
looking down on him since he once...

654
00:44:44,750 --> 00:44:47,448
got a good beating from you in the teacher's office?

655
00:44:47,449 --> 00:44:49,389
- Ms. Choi... - If neither is true,

656
00:44:51,060 --> 00:44:53,389
there is only one thing you can do.

657
00:44:56,659 --> 00:44:57,900
Show support.

658
00:44:58,630 --> 00:44:59,659
Go, Mr. Pyo!

659
00:45:21,920 --> 00:45:23,250
I appreciate you taking the time to see me.

660
00:45:26,319 --> 00:45:28,630
Yet, I'm still a big fan of yours.

661
00:45:30,299 --> 00:45:31,960
That is why I'm telling you this.

662
00:45:32,759 --> 00:45:35,029
You should be worried about the competition.

663
00:45:36,469 --> 00:45:38,770
Now that Mr. Pyo has shifted gears,

664
00:45:38,969 --> 00:45:39,969
he will be an opponent...

665
00:45:39,970 --> 00:45:41,869
that might give you a run for your money.

666
00:45:44,409 --> 00:45:45,540
His acumen has been verified...

667
00:45:46,409 --> 00:45:47,750
by me personally.

668
00:46:33,659 --> 00:46:34,659
Unbelievable.

669
00:46:37,029 --> 00:46:38,130
"I don't want to meet with you today."

670
00:46:39,060 --> 00:46:40,400
How could she say that?

671
00:46:41,900 --> 00:46:44,600
Hey, let me be honest.

672
00:46:44,869 --> 00:46:47,739
I'm barely getting used to you dating our teacher,

673
00:46:48,509 --> 00:46:51,008
but now you want me to give you dating advice as well?

674
00:46:51,009 --> 00:46:52,040
Hear me out.

675
00:46:52,580 --> 00:46:54,408
The one whose feelings are deeper is at a disadvantage,

676
00:46:54,409 --> 00:46:55,880
but how could she do this to me?

677
00:46:59,049 --> 00:47:00,690
- Here you go. - Thank you.

678
00:47:01,489 --> 00:47:03,619
Did you and Hye Jin perhaps get into an argument?

679
00:47:04,690 --> 00:47:07,389
No, I just had to take it, no questions asked.

680
00:47:07,589 --> 00:47:10,758
What? But Hye Jin isn't the type to vent her frustration...

681
00:47:10,759 --> 00:47:12,000
out on people.

682
00:47:12,100 --> 00:47:14,830
Tell me about it. I'm frustrated because I know that.

683
00:47:17,440 --> 00:47:18,770
So much for the relationship being a secret.

684
00:47:19,339 --> 00:47:20,869
Is there anyone in Daechi-dong who doesn't know?

685
00:47:22,969 --> 00:47:23,980
Hang in there.

686
00:47:31,250 --> 00:47:32,319
What's on your mind?

687
00:47:34,549 --> 00:47:36,690
That a younger guy is not ideal...

688
00:47:37,259 --> 00:47:38,318
to date.

689
00:47:38,319 --> 00:47:39,719
- What? Why? - Why?

690
00:47:41,889 --> 00:47:43,560
I wasn't like this at 29.

691
00:47:44,900 --> 00:47:46,659
Or maybe age isn't the issue.

692
00:47:47,969 --> 00:47:49,199
What...

693
00:47:52,170 --> 00:47:53,239
What do you mean by that?

694
00:47:55,509 --> 00:47:56,940
Ms. Seo...

695
00:47:57,440 --> 00:48:00,779
It's not that she doesn't want to see you. She probably can't.

696
00:48:03,880 --> 00:48:05,980
What exactly did Mr. Pyo say?

697
00:48:07,690 --> 00:48:08,850
I didn't ask.

698
00:48:09,250 --> 00:48:11,420
You're a disgrace to all men who date older women.

699
00:48:13,020 --> 00:48:14,290
Without asking about what he said,

700
00:48:14,790 --> 00:48:15,989
you just told her...

701
00:48:16,830 --> 00:48:18,029
he was the competition to beat?

702
00:48:19,730 --> 00:48:22,469
Was I wrong to say that?

703
00:48:23,170 --> 00:48:25,238
Ms. Seo is tough and...

704
00:48:25,239 --> 00:48:26,569
Yes, she's tough.

705
00:48:26,940 --> 00:48:28,770
But even people like her hurt just as much.

706
00:48:29,009 --> 00:48:30,239
As if.

707
00:48:30,639 --> 00:48:32,239
Their offensive strategy is pretty obvious.

708
00:48:34,080 --> 00:48:35,949
The teacher she challenged and won against...

709
00:48:36,350 --> 00:48:38,979
quit his school job of 20 years and told her...

710
00:48:38,980 --> 00:48:40,619
he was entering the private sector.

711
00:48:41,619 --> 00:48:43,789
That was more than him declaring a simple war...

712
00:48:43,790 --> 00:48:45,219
that would end in a few Chanyoung students jumping ship.

713
00:48:46,020 --> 00:48:47,529
Of course it was.

714
00:48:48,029 --> 00:48:50,729
But then her favorite student...

715
00:48:50,730 --> 00:48:51,830
Hold on.

716
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:54,029
"Boyfriend."

717
00:48:56,569 --> 00:48:58,569
What? Why are you looking at me like that?

718
00:48:59,639 --> 00:49:01,440
I feel bad for Ms. Seo.

719
00:49:04,679 --> 00:49:06,279
- You're done for. - Hey!

720
00:49:06,909 --> 00:49:08,350
What do you mean it's over for me?

721
00:49:08,480 --> 00:49:11,020
You should be grateful that Seo Hye Jin is earnest.

722
00:49:11,520 --> 00:49:13,479
Or else, you would've been dumped.

723
00:49:13,480 --> 00:49:16,519
What did I say about you saying her name like that?

724
00:49:16,520 --> 00:49:18,489
She has to play the role of your sweet first love...

725
00:49:18,759 --> 00:49:20,690
and also be the mentor who changes your life.

726
00:49:22,759 --> 00:49:25,299
Although she's bleeding internally,

727
00:49:25,529 --> 00:49:28,000
she has to cut off the enemy commander's head.

728
00:49:29,299 --> 00:49:30,400
What else was there?

729
00:49:31,440 --> 00:49:32,440
Oh, right.

730
00:49:32,869 --> 00:49:34,209
When you whine,

731
00:49:34,210 --> 00:49:35,540
she has to indulge in a healthy discussion with you.

732
00:49:35,710 --> 00:49:38,739
Unbelievable. Seo Hye Jin is a true saint.

733
00:49:41,880 --> 00:49:42,880
Gosh.

734
00:49:44,580 --> 00:49:45,619
You fool.

735
00:49:46,520 --> 00:49:49,290
Ms. Nam, I'm sorry, but can I take off?

736
00:49:49,489 --> 00:49:51,460
Yes, but get the bill.

737
00:49:51,790 --> 00:49:53,158
I'll get it, so just go.

738
00:49:53,159 --> 00:49:55,929
No, I should pay for today's class. Thanks.

739
00:49:56,290 --> 00:49:57,699
Make sure you get her home safely.

740
00:49:58,600 --> 00:50:00,400
Don't worry and beat it.

741
00:50:07,210 --> 00:50:08,569
- I'm heading out first. - I see.

742
00:50:09,239 --> 00:50:10,980
- I'll see you around. - Sure.

743
00:50:11,480 --> 00:50:12,679
- See you. - Bye.

744
00:50:36,170 --> 00:50:37,369
Hey, So Young.

745
00:50:38,839 --> 00:50:40,400
Yes. I'm going to head home now.

746
00:50:41,670 --> 00:50:43,610
Yes. I've been busy today.

747
00:50:43,839 --> 00:50:45,139
I heard you guys had a fight.

748
00:50:46,779 --> 00:50:49,380
How do you think I heard about that? I have my informant here.

749
00:50:51,080 --> 00:50:53,719
Actually, if you're not far, why don't you stop by here?

750
00:50:54,690 --> 00:50:56,949
I'd love to hear about your quarrel with your boyfriend for once.

751
00:50:58,290 --> 00:51:00,690
Seriously. What on earth happened?

752
00:51:01,190 --> 00:51:02,759
No, it's nothing serious.

753
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:05,060
I just...

754
00:51:06,299 --> 00:51:08,029
had a small problem.

755
00:51:09,569 --> 00:51:10,569
Yes.

756
00:51:11,069 --> 00:51:12,139
So Young.

757
00:51:13,400 --> 00:51:16,738
I had a very long day today.

758
00:51:16,739 --> 00:51:18,639
Yes. Right.

759
00:51:19,909 --> 00:51:21,179
Let's take a rain check on our year-end party.

760
00:51:22,750 --> 00:51:24,250
And stop talking about Jun Ho.

761
00:51:25,850 --> 00:51:28,949
Actually, I miss him like crazy.

762
00:51:33,560 --> 00:51:34,889
Sure. Okay.

763
00:51:36,159 --> 00:51:38,560
Yes. I know that you're busy. I'll always be understanding.

764
00:51:39,029 --> 00:51:41,069
Okay. All right then.

765
00:51:42,069 --> 00:51:43,830
Drive safely. Yes.

766
00:51:43,969 --> 00:51:45,040
Bye.

767
00:51:51,239 --> 00:51:53,339
She told me she missed him like crazy.

768
00:51:53,580 --> 00:51:54,679
No.

769
00:51:55,580 --> 00:51:56,679
What? What is it?

770
00:51:56,710 --> 00:51:58,949
I don't think it's a typical fight couples have.

771
00:51:59,619 --> 00:52:00,619
What?

772
00:52:01,790 --> 00:52:04,459
- Earlier, Mr. Lee was here... - Okay.

773
00:52:04,460 --> 00:52:06,020
with his friend and another teacher.

774
00:52:07,020 --> 00:52:10,089
Well, you can drop me off in Donam-dong.

775
00:52:11,230 --> 00:52:13,799
Wait. Is that where you live?

776
00:52:14,500 --> 00:52:15,630
I thought you lived a bit farther north.

777
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:19,469
I won't have to pay a lot of money for the taxi if I catch one there.

778
00:52:19,670 --> 00:52:20,670
That area has a lot of taxis too.

779
00:52:22,739 --> 00:52:23,810
Gosh, don't do that.

780
00:52:24,009 --> 00:52:25,339
Let me drop you off in your neighborhood.

781
00:52:26,540 --> 00:52:28,380
It's the year-end holiday season. It'll be difficult to get a taxi.

782
00:52:29,049 --> 00:52:30,618
We live in a scary world these days.

783
00:52:30,619 --> 00:52:32,350
I can't let a stranger know where I live.

784
00:52:33,350 --> 00:52:34,889
- Gosh. - Goodness.

785
00:52:35,619 --> 00:52:38,060
You can't find a guy with whom you can feel safer than with me.

786
00:52:39,259 --> 00:52:41,790
I'm Jun Ho's friend, Seo Hye Jin's former student,

787
00:52:42,489 --> 00:52:43,830
and Kim Hyo Im's son.

788
00:52:45,699 --> 00:52:46,699
Gosh.

789
00:52:51,440 --> 00:52:55,069
Which area of study do you specialize in?

790
00:52:55,909 --> 00:52:58,639
Among literature, reading, grammar, and so on.

791
00:52:59,440 --> 00:53:02,009
I would say classical poetry.

792
00:53:02,949 --> 00:53:04,219
I like it because it's fun.

793
00:53:04,920 --> 00:53:05,920
What?

794
00:53:07,420 --> 00:53:08,750
I like studying too.

795
00:53:10,420 --> 00:53:11,420
No way.

796
00:53:12,159 --> 00:53:14,259
What? Was that unexpected?

797
00:53:15,230 --> 00:53:16,230
Yes.

798
00:53:17,130 --> 00:53:18,130
What?

799
00:53:18,130 --> 00:53:19,130
I heard you majored in history...

800
00:53:19,131 --> 00:53:20,460
because your grades weren't good enough...

801
00:53:20,929 --> 00:53:22,600
and joined the graduate program because you couldn't get a job.

802
00:53:23,529 --> 00:53:25,040
I have to say that...

803
00:53:25,440 --> 00:53:27,770
so that they don't ask me questions and leave me alone.

804
00:53:29,210 --> 00:53:32,380
But studying is fun for me.

805
00:53:34,980 --> 00:53:36,679
If my mom hears this, she will be shocked...

806
00:53:37,619 --> 00:53:39,049
and ask why...

807
00:53:39,850 --> 00:53:42,089
I couldn't get into a better college if I liked studying this much.

808
00:55:03,270 --> 00:55:04,699
Where are you?

809
00:55:04,799 --> 00:55:06,469
Your car isn't in the parking lot. I'm worried about you.

810
00:55:08,409 --> 00:55:10,139
I understand that you don't want to see me.

811
00:55:10,980 --> 00:55:12,480
But I still want to be with you.

812
00:55:26,520 --> 00:55:27,830
You won't even hear me breathing.

813
00:55:28,989 --> 00:55:30,259
Let me just stay by your side.

814
00:55:40,199 --> 00:55:41,869
- Would you like a receipt? - No.

815
00:55:43,040 --> 00:55:44,540
- Thank you. - The food was great.

816
00:55:44,639 --> 00:55:46,779
- Thanks. - Thank you for treating us.

817
00:55:47,650 --> 00:55:49,880
- Thank you. - Bye.

818
00:55:51,449 --> 00:55:53,449
I'll clean up quickly. Just wait a little longer.

819
00:55:54,420 --> 00:55:56,319
Gosh. I wonder how that feels.

820
00:55:56,819 --> 00:55:57,860
What? What did you say?

821
00:55:59,659 --> 00:56:00,988
Say that you hate...

822
00:56:00,989 --> 00:56:02,330
- this certain side of you. - Okay.

823
00:56:02,529 --> 00:56:04,159
You've been living your life, overlooking that side of you.

824
00:56:05,259 --> 00:56:06,759
But one day, out of the blue,

825
00:56:07,100 --> 00:56:09,299
you encounter that very same side...

826
00:56:09,600 --> 00:56:10,900
in someone you hold dear.

827
00:56:12,139 --> 00:56:13,799
It just pops up as if it's always been there.

828
00:56:16,210 --> 00:56:18,179
Gosh. That...

829
00:56:19,839 --> 00:56:21,049
would be scary.

830
00:56:23,980 --> 00:56:24,980
Just watch over me.

831
00:56:27,850 --> 00:56:28,889
I'm scared.

832
00:56:30,049 --> 00:56:31,290
When was that?

833
00:56:31,389 --> 00:56:33,520
When did I say something was off about Jun Ho?

834
00:56:33,690 --> 00:56:36,029
The day Hye Jin's event became a total bust?

835
00:56:36,790 --> 00:56:38,199
Yes, that's when it was.

836
00:56:39,460 --> 00:56:41,000
Yes. I remember saying this that day.

837
00:56:41,500 --> 00:56:44,799
I said a certain aspect of Jun Ho reminded me of Hye Jin,

838
00:56:45,440 --> 00:56:48,139
and this resembling aspect might be provoking Hye Jin.

839
00:56:51,139 --> 00:56:54,080
Hey, I just mindlessly thought that it was a sign...

840
00:56:54,409 --> 00:56:57,279
that they started to think of each other romantically.

841
00:57:00,989 --> 00:57:02,719
I guess that wasn't everything.

842
00:57:39,190 --> 00:57:40,219
Jun Ho.

843
00:57:44,299 --> 00:57:46,199
What are you doing here? Why didn't you go upstairs?

844
00:57:46,630 --> 00:57:48,130
Get in. There's somewhere I want to go with you.

845
00:58:05,719 --> 00:58:06,920
I'm sorry.

846
00:58:09,319 --> 00:58:11,089
I scared you by telling you how you were...

847
00:58:12,060 --> 00:58:13,460
my first love and my teacher.

848
00:58:15,659 --> 00:58:16,759
I told you I loved you,

849
00:58:17,860 --> 00:58:19,759
but I only saw the side of you I wanted to see.

850
00:58:20,699 --> 00:58:21,699
I'm sorry.

851
00:58:25,139 --> 00:58:26,699
Did you get a crash course on relationships?

852
00:58:28,270 --> 00:58:29,270
Maybe?

853
00:58:32,339 --> 00:58:33,339
Put on your seatbelt.

854
00:58:45,520 --> 00:58:47,060
I went to Choisun Academy.

855
00:58:50,659 --> 00:58:52,900
I understood why Choi Hyung Sun was the best in the field.

856
00:58:54,670 --> 00:58:56,329
She summed up what kind of person I was...

857
00:58:56,330 --> 00:58:58,440
and made it very clear for me to understand it.

858
00:59:00,969 --> 00:59:02,270
I'll never forget it.

859
00:59:04,639 --> 00:59:05,710
What did she say?

860
00:59:07,179 --> 00:59:08,650
She called me a wrecker.

861
00:59:12,150 --> 00:59:13,480
Is she crazy?

862
00:59:15,549 --> 00:59:17,219
Gosh. Seriously.

863
00:59:18,060 --> 00:59:19,060
Goodness.

864
00:59:19,790 --> 00:59:20,819
Just forget what she said about you.

865
00:59:22,560 --> 00:59:24,730
She said I bulldozed over my enemy like a wrecker in a fight.

866
00:59:25,230 --> 00:59:26,428
But once I came out on top,

867
00:59:26,429 --> 00:59:27,429
she said I took the moral high ground.

868
00:59:28,500 --> 00:59:30,830
She went over how big of a hypocrite I am...

869
00:59:31,839 --> 00:59:34,440
and how selfish and cunning I am.

870
00:59:35,509 --> 00:59:37,339
She picked me apart.

871
00:59:38,540 --> 00:59:40,909
I bet she tried to find the most hurtful things to say.

872
00:59:42,080 --> 00:59:44,079
This is my point. Why did you go there?

873
00:59:44,080 --> 00:59:45,150
- That wouldn't change... - Don't talk back.

874
00:59:45,549 --> 00:59:46,949
I'm driving us there, so we can talk about this.

875
00:59:50,319 --> 00:59:51,889
I walked this path to barge into the office,

876
00:59:52,089 --> 00:59:53,319
acting all confident and proud.

877
00:59:55,759 --> 00:59:57,489
Your students' grades were on the line.

878
00:59:58,429 --> 00:59:59,630
I did it for my own gain.

879
01:00:01,230 --> 01:00:02,770
The answer is number five?

880
01:00:03,400 --> 01:00:04,400
Gosh.

881
01:00:05,100 --> 01:00:06,799
I thought, "The schoolteacher is going to be stubborn."

882
01:00:08,239 --> 01:00:10,670
"If so, I should make a big scene for everyone to see."

883
01:00:11,810 --> 01:00:15,179
"It's a chance I can spread my name without spending a dime."

884
01:00:17,509 --> 01:00:19,880
In the beginning, I was happy because I got to teach more classes.

885
01:00:22,420 --> 01:00:25,520
I vaguely sensed that something had gone wrong...

886
01:00:26,389 --> 01:00:27,389
when Mr. Pyo said...

887
01:00:27,390 --> 01:00:29,190
he was going to base his questions only on the textbook.

888
01:00:29,790 --> 01:00:33,060
I thought, "He will be in a tight spot at school."

889
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:35,069
I could see that coming.

890
01:00:35,630 --> 01:00:37,230
But I didn't care. Why would I care?

891
01:00:38,199 --> 01:00:40,169
I didn't want to lose the new students I got,

892
01:00:40,170 --> 01:00:41,270
so I was even more determined.

893
01:00:44,139 --> 01:00:45,639
- Was that the time... - Yes.

894
01:00:46,480 --> 01:00:48,380
That's when you insisted on joining the academy.

895
01:00:49,350 --> 01:00:51,278
I thought about ways to stop you from joining the academy.

896
01:00:51,279 --> 01:00:53,080
But I stopped because of that incident.

897
01:00:55,520 --> 01:00:58,888
Seriously? Who knew Mr. Pyo was doing me a favor?

898
01:00:58,889 --> 01:01:00,388
Gosh, don't say that.

899
01:01:00,389 --> 01:01:01,889
While we worked together at the academy,

900
01:01:02,659 --> 01:01:05,100
think about what he had to go through at school.

901
01:01:06,929 --> 01:01:08,069
That breaks my heart.

902
01:01:24,049 --> 01:01:25,380
But what are we doing here?

903
01:01:27,049 --> 01:01:28,649
Walking this path might help me understand,

904
01:01:28,650 --> 01:01:30,219
even if it was only a fraction of what he went through.

905
01:01:32,690 --> 01:01:35,229
Like how heavy his heart must have been every morning...

906
01:01:35,230 --> 01:01:36,560
as he walked up this path...

907
01:01:38,960 --> 01:01:41,429
and how difficult it must have been to cross that gate.

908
01:01:43,199 --> 01:01:44,299
Do you think I'm overreacting?

909
01:01:46,540 --> 01:01:47,540
A bit.

910
01:01:49,909 --> 01:01:52,380
The White Haired Witch is the one with the evilest intention.

911
01:01:52,440 --> 01:01:54,080
That's what I wanted to think too.

912
01:01:55,250 --> 01:01:57,080
When I realized what I was doing, I was in front of Choisun Academy.

913
01:01:59,549 --> 01:02:01,719
"You're responsible for making Mr. Pyo quit his job."

914
01:02:04,489 --> 01:02:05,819
I guess I wanted to criticize her.

915
01:02:08,790 --> 01:02:10,159
But in the end, it backfired.

916
01:02:12,500 --> 01:02:13,500
And?

917
01:02:23,040 --> 01:02:24,610
I want to turn back time.

918
01:02:27,179 --> 01:02:28,179
That's impossible.

919
01:02:29,080 --> 01:02:30,080
I know.

920
01:02:30,580 --> 01:02:33,719
But shouldn't I at least give back what I gained from Mr. Pyo?

921
01:02:34,750 --> 01:02:36,089
That's also impossible.

922
01:02:38,190 --> 01:02:39,759
Are you telling me you want to split your students?

923
01:02:42,730 --> 01:02:44,928
If you do anything that negatively affects the academy,

924
01:02:44,929 --> 01:02:47,299
the director and vice-director won't let that slide this time.

925
01:02:49,500 --> 01:02:51,839
Remember what you had to face because our free lecture was a bust.

926
01:03:01,409 --> 01:03:02,480
Let's go to my house.

927
01:03:04,719 --> 01:03:07,279
I have self-restraint too. I won't make a move on you.

928
01:03:10,150 --> 01:03:11,219
Please understand that...

929
01:03:12,989 --> 01:03:15,560
I don't want to leave you all alone after what happened today.

930
01:03:25,170 --> 01:03:27,239
Gosh. They're all too big for you.

931
01:03:28,069 --> 01:03:29,069
Let's see.

932
01:04:41,380 --> 01:04:44,150
Does listening to this kind of sound help you fall asleep?

933
01:04:46,020 --> 01:04:47,179
Yes, according to other people.

934
01:04:48,449 --> 01:04:50,650
But I sleep just fine every night without stuff like this.

935
01:04:56,560 --> 01:04:59,060
I can't remember the last time I went to the beach.

936
01:05:10,270 --> 01:05:11,310
This is nice.

937
01:06:55,610 --> 01:06:56,909
(Certainly, 1st Class, Korean Teacher: Lee Jun Ho)

938
01:08:01,980 --> 01:08:03,009
Hey, Mom.

939
01:08:03,179 --> 01:08:06,350
Is the passcode to your house different from our home passcode?

940
01:08:08,020 --> 01:08:09,089
What do you mean?

941
01:08:14,389 --> 01:08:15,389
Where?

942
01:08:17,230 --> 01:08:18,259
Not there.

943
01:08:18,799 --> 01:08:20,059
It's cold. You might catch a cold.

944
01:08:20,060 --> 01:08:21,060
- No. - Where then?

945
01:08:22,100 --> 01:08:23,100
Over there.

946
01:08:23,669 --> 01:08:24,799
Behind the clothes rack. Come here.

947
01:08:29,039 --> 01:08:30,070
Here.

948
01:08:32,509 --> 01:08:33,509
Be careful.

949
01:08:36,709 --> 01:08:37,910
Stay here for a bit.

950
01:08:38,350 --> 01:08:39,350
Your shoes.

951
01:08:46,860 --> 01:08:48,588
Here. I'm really sorry.

952
01:08:48,589 --> 01:08:49,860
What are you doing?

953
01:08:50,060 --> 01:08:52,730
Mom! Let me put on some clothes. Wait.

954
01:09:03,209 --> 01:09:05,009
Hey, Mom.

955
01:09:06,039 --> 01:09:07,940
- Hey. - Gosh. Give me that.

956
01:09:13,579 --> 01:09:15,020
You should've called me before you came.

957

(The Midnight Romance in Hagwon)

958
01:09:45,379 --> 01:09:47,149
How could you break your mother's heart like this?

959
01:09:47,150 --> 01:09:48,620
Why are you upset?

960
01:09:49,219 --> 01:09:51,249
I'll focus on my job.

961
01:09:51,589 --> 01:09:53,289
I get the feeling she might not spend time with me for some time.

962
01:09:53,360 --> 01:09:56,289
Are you also considering Ms. Seo's next position?

963
01:09:56,389 --> 01:09:57,990
I hope I didn't disappoint you.

964
01:09:58,129 --> 01:09:59,730
Our purposes may be different,

965
01:09:59,829 --> 01:10:01,329
but we may have the same goal.

966
01:10:01,700 --> 01:10:04,370
You brought me Seo Hye Jin's head.

967
01:10:05,299 --> 01:10:06,440
You're not playing fair.

968
01:10:07,169 --> 01:10:08,410
I want to date, though.

969
01:10:08,770 --> 01:10:09,909
Why don't we date?

970
01:10:09,910 --> 01:10:11,339
I'll make the study materials again.

971
01:10:11,610 --> 01:10:13,740
It's the same as getting rid of everything all at once.

972
01:10:14,009 --> 01:10:15,009
Lee Jun Ho!
