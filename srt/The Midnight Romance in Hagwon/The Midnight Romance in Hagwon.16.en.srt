Did she say...

8
00:00:50,024 --> 00:00:52,893
I wasn't just going down, but that I was crashing and burning?

9
00:00:54,054 --> 00:00:56,094
- Well... - Did she say...

10
00:00:56,963 --> 00:00:59,264
there's really not one ounce of hope...

11
00:00:59,933 --> 00:01:01,063
left for this academy?

12
00:01:02,433 --> 00:01:03,503
Yes.

13
00:01:05,633 --> 00:01:08,473
She said we should all escape soon.

14
00:01:14,074 --> 00:01:16,684
Don't you feel uneasy about working for...

15
00:01:17,884 --> 00:01:18,913
someone like that?

No. I'll report to him.

- Congratulations. - Congratulations.

31
00:03:12,933 --> 00:03:15,333
Humanity majors are no big deal.

32

It's Park Yo Seb, right?

33
00:03:16,734 --> 00:03:19,302
Yes. This is a gift from his mother.

Yes, Ms. Choi.

- Bye. - Bye.

40
00:04:04,583 --> 00:04:07,884
I see that Kim Chae Yun hit a grand slammer.

41
00:04:09,123 --> 00:04:10,724
Against Seo Hye Jin of all people.

42
00:04:12,123 --> 00:04:13,724
Did you talk to Lee Myeong Jun?

43
00:04:15,224 --> 00:04:16,622
They can keep him.

44
00:04:16,623 --> 00:04:17,963
He's just a dung fly.

45
00:04:20,194 --> 00:04:22,434
Most of the students have left,

46
00:04:22,634 --> 00:04:25,533
and Kim Hyun Tak can't pay all the instructors as they want.

47
00:04:27,473 --> 00:04:29,203
Seo Hye Jin as good as admitted...

48
00:04:29,204 --> 00:04:30,973
that she can't make a comeback.

49
00:04:33,444 --> 00:04:35,983
Then why did you call Min Ji too?

50
00:04:37,143 --> 00:04:38,554
Do you play chess?

51
00:04:39,884 --> 00:04:42,483
- I know the basic rules. - Okay.

52
00:04:43,124 --> 00:04:44,954
The weakest piece is the pawn.

53
00:04:45,523 --> 00:04:48,593
It gets promoted when it advances to the last rank.

54
00:04:49,124 --> 00:04:50,864
Usually to a queen.

55
00:04:51,764 --> 00:04:55,504
When the pawn reaches that stage, it changes the game.

56
00:04:58,074 --> 00:05:00,074
Choi Hyung Sun vacated her studio apartment office.

57
00:05:01,343 --> 00:05:02,343
That place...

58
00:05:02,574 --> 00:05:05,573
Yes. It's where she tutored kids illegally at night.

59
00:05:05,574 --> 00:05:06,574
Right.

60
00:05:06,674 --> 00:05:08,782
She seems to think I have something on her.

61
00:05:08,783 --> 00:05:09,783
She put it up for sale.

62
00:05:12,254 --> 00:05:14,783
To see how Choi Hyung Sun reacts,

63
00:05:15,283 --> 00:05:16,782
and to teach...

64
00:05:16,783 --> 00:05:18,853
the stupid Jun Ho who he challenged,

65
00:05:20,853 --> 00:05:21,994
let's make a move.

66
00:05:22,564 --> 00:05:25,864
Set something up.

67
00:05:26,864 --> 00:05:27,934
A situation...

68
00:05:28,733 --> 00:05:31,504
that gives me the justification...

69
00:05:32,273 --> 00:05:34,403
to stay at Daechi Chase.

70
00:05:35,773 --> 00:05:38,473
A ruse that Woo Seung Hui will buy.

71
00:05:41,413 --> 00:05:44,314
Are you that important to her?

72
00:05:44,653 --> 00:05:45,684
Listen.

73
00:05:46,653 --> 00:05:47,754
I'm someone too.

74
00:05:54,194 --> 00:05:55,223
But...

75
00:05:56,523 --> 00:06:00,163
if I were to say, "I'll replace Seo Hye Jin,"

76
00:06:01,233 --> 00:06:02,603
who would buy it?

77
00:06:05,773 --> 00:06:06,874
I'll set something up.

78
00:06:09,473 --> 00:06:10,504
Drink.

79
00:06:11,944 --> 00:06:16,413
You need to put in a good word to Kim Hyun Tak for me.

80
00:06:22,824 --> 00:06:23,824
Drink some more.

81
00:06:25,054 --> 00:06:27,554
I made a huge call that could...

82
00:06:28,523 --> 00:06:31,793
save our nation, and that's important.

83
00:06:32,364 --> 00:06:34,463
Why would you bring kimchi at this hour?

84
00:06:35,603 --> 00:06:37,163
The kimchi's an excuse.

85
00:06:39,033 --> 00:06:40,634
I came to see how you were...

86
00:06:40,704 --> 00:06:42,603
and how things were going.

87
00:06:43,543 --> 00:06:45,244
I have nothing to offer.

88
00:06:46,244 --> 00:06:48,583
Water will do. I won't stay for long.

89
00:06:50,184 --> 00:06:51,184
Okay.

90
00:06:55,023 --> 00:06:56,083
Were you studying?

91
00:06:56,783 --> 00:06:57,824
I was pretending to.

92
00:07:03,223 --> 00:07:05,033
I won't pretend I don't know.

93
00:07:08,903 --> 00:07:10,264
I heard from my husband.

94
00:07:11,934 --> 00:07:15,074
You're going through the worst time of your life.

95
00:07:15,874 --> 00:07:18,314
Lee Jun Ho's grovelling to me?

96
00:07:22,483 --> 00:07:23,583
Who would believe that?

97
00:07:31,624 --> 00:07:33,023
Woo Seung Hui...

98
00:07:34,324 --> 00:07:36,064
betrayed you, didn't she?

99
00:07:36,723 --> 00:07:37,994
With Ms. Seo's material.

100
00:07:38,533 --> 00:07:39,533
Hey.

101
00:07:40,293 --> 00:07:41,764
What do you think of me?

102
00:07:43,463 --> 00:07:44,533
I made the call...

103
00:07:45,674 --> 00:07:47,874
to save our nation.

104
00:07:48,804 --> 00:07:51,244
Can't you just tell me what happened...

105
00:07:52,543 --> 00:07:54,042
between you and Ms. Woo?

106
00:07:54,043 --> 00:07:55,444
You can ask all you want.

107
00:07:56,543 --> 00:07:57,643
I'll never say.

108
00:08:00,983 --> 00:08:02,023
Shoot.

109
00:08:04,954 --> 00:08:06,324
I hurt all over.

110
00:08:07,593 --> 00:08:08,893
As if I was beaten.

111
00:08:09,463 --> 00:08:11,023
I'm not surprised.

112
00:08:12,064 --> 00:08:15,004
You might lose the life you worked for.

113
00:08:16,564 --> 00:08:17,764
There's that too.

114
00:08:20,273 --> 00:08:21,773
But I hurt more because of Jun Ho.

115
00:08:24,913 --> 00:08:26,174
I think he grew up...

116
00:08:27,273 --> 00:08:28,283
all at once.

117
00:08:31,413 --> 00:08:33,083
That's a good thing.

118
00:08:34,824 --> 00:08:37,723
Wouldn't it be a huge problem if he clung to you...

119
00:08:38,324 --> 00:08:39,694
and asked you to babysit him?

120
00:08:42,863 --> 00:08:45,794
So what? Are you bored of him now?

121
00:08:47,863 --> 00:08:50,763
Did you like him more when he stirred your world...

122
00:08:51,064 --> 00:08:52,204
with his youth?

123
00:08:53,404 --> 00:08:54,404
I did.

124
00:08:55,574 --> 00:08:57,774
I experienced things for the first time...

125
00:08:58,174 --> 00:08:59,873
and was loved more than I deserved.

126
00:09:02,583 --> 00:09:03,713
But right now...

127
00:09:04,814 --> 00:09:05,883
Right now what?

128
00:09:08,253 --> 00:09:09,324
I'm just worried.

129
00:09:11,993 --> 00:09:13,324
Why worry?

130
00:09:14,424 --> 00:09:15,763
He's still young,

131
00:09:16,424 --> 00:09:17,564
and he's smart.

132
00:09:18,294 --> 00:09:19,934
Not about Jun Ho. Me.

133
00:09:23,404 --> 00:09:24,534
At first,

134
00:09:25,733 --> 00:09:28,204
I was scared to death of him coming into my life.

135
00:09:30,444 --> 00:09:31,513
But now...

136
00:09:34,414 --> 00:09:36,343
I can't imagine being without him by my side.

137
00:09:40,654 --> 00:09:42,184
I'm silly, aren't I?

138
00:09:48,194 --> 00:09:50,664
Defamation or libel.

139
00:09:51,463 --> 00:09:53,564
Tell me if there's anyone you want to take down.

140
00:09:54,394 --> 00:09:55,833
Let me make a fortune too.

141
00:09:57,164 --> 00:09:58,233

142
00:10:00,674 --> 00:10:01,843
Cheer up.

Are we telepathic?

148
00:10:57,763 --> 00:10:59,963
What got into you?

149
00:11:00,394 --> 00:11:01,704
You drank all this while?

150
00:11:02,963 --> 00:11:04,103
My goodness.

151
00:11:04,503 --> 00:11:06,904
Lee Myeong Jun's such a heavy drinker.

152
00:11:07,503 --> 00:11:08,804
I almost drowned.

153
00:11:10,144 --> 00:11:13,074
Do you know how many people you took on today?

154
00:11:14,013 --> 00:11:16,483
- Should I have kept count? - Aren't you tired?

155
00:11:17,414 --> 00:11:18,414
I'm tired.

156
00:11:19,414 --> 00:11:21,283
Then you should've gone home.

157
00:11:21,284 --> 00:11:22,353
I wanted to see you.

158
00:11:25,894 --> 00:11:27,194
I called, but you didn't pick up.

159
00:11:29,694 --> 00:11:30,763
I left my phone upstairs.

160
00:11:32,493 --> 00:11:33,493
That's why I'm here.

161
00:11:35,904 --> 00:11:37,503
I was going to go home if your light was off.

162
00:11:38,904 --> 00:11:40,674
If it was on, I was going to come up to say hi.

163
00:11:46,774 --> 00:11:48,483
Because I missed you so, so much.

164
00:11:55,684 --> 00:11:57,524
You look head over heels in love.

165
00:12:08,763 --> 00:12:10,404
I'd like to stay longer.

166
00:12:13,333 --> 00:12:15,174
But you're too under-dressed.

167
00:12:17,003 --> 00:12:18,044
I'm fine.

168
00:12:20,343 --> 00:12:21,414
I'm fine too.

169
00:12:24,814 --> 00:12:25,853
See you.

170
00:12:27,654 --> 00:12:28,723
Okay.

171
00:12:29,083 --> 00:12:30,154
Go to sleep.

172
00:12:31,184 --> 00:12:33,024
Give all your worries to me.

173
00:12:35,294 --> 00:12:36,363
Can you do that?

174
00:12:38,664 --> 00:12:39,664
Yes.

175
00:12:49,343 --> 00:12:50,373
Wait.

176
00:12:56,983 --> 00:12:58,353
Put me to sleep before you go.

177

189
00:14:25,873 --> 00:14:26,934
Enjoy your meal.

190
00:14:29,503 --> 00:14:31,044
- Let's talk as we eat. - Okay.

191
00:14:32,274 --> 00:14:35,314
Do you mind if I take a photo first?

192
00:14:37,144 --> 00:14:38,914
Go ahead.

193
00:15:06,414 --> 00:15:08,314
- Thanks for the treat. - Sure.

194
00:15:10,444 --> 00:15:11,583
Do you have lots of followers?

195
00:15:13,013 --> 00:15:14,654
Not really.

196
00:15:14,853 --> 00:15:16,753
I was away from school for a while,

197
00:15:16,924 --> 00:15:18,592
so I don't have many friends,

198
00:15:18,593 --> 00:15:20,252
and I was busy with work too.

199
00:15:20,253 --> 00:15:22,394
I see. Well,

200
00:15:23,794 --> 00:15:26,034
I heard the situation you're in,

201
00:15:26,263 --> 00:15:28,093
but I don't see why you'd be busy.

202
00:15:28,503 --> 00:15:29,564
Pardon?

203
00:15:29,904 --> 00:15:32,934
Ms. Seo has so few students now.

204
00:15:34,574 --> 00:15:38,204
Oh, yes. But I think she's working on that.

205
00:15:39,473 --> 00:15:40,973
You must feel antsy.

206
00:15:41,544 --> 00:15:42,944
Ms. Seo pays you...

207
00:15:43,284 --> 00:15:45,713
from her own salary.

208
00:15:46,353 --> 00:15:49,454
She has a knack for sniffing out the musty scent they give off.

209
00:15:50,083 --> 00:15:53,424
Ms. Seo hasn't said anything yet.

210
00:15:54,394 --> 00:15:58,664
I see she's trying to be cool.

211
00:15:59,894 --> 00:16:01,034
To not put pressure on you.

212
00:16:06,074 --> 00:16:09,373
There's no need to be shy.

213
00:16:10,644 --> 00:16:12,713
I asked to see you to share good news.

214
00:16:17,083 --> 00:16:19,753
While you get paid your usual salary,

215
00:16:20,414 --> 00:16:23,523
I can give you a part-time opening that provides...

216
00:16:23,524 --> 00:16:24,853
a scholarship.

217
00:16:30,924 --> 00:16:33,534
Hand out the new address to the special class students.

218
00:16:34,194 --> 00:16:36,763
Don't text them. Give out handwritten notes.

219
00:16:37,034 --> 00:16:38,103
Okay.

220
00:16:38,733 --> 00:16:41,534
Be sure no one's stupid enough to go to the old address.

221
00:16:41,733 --> 00:16:43,174
Tell them to keep it a secret.

222
00:16:44,674 --> 00:16:45,674
Got it.

223
00:16:50,544 --> 00:16:52,613
You work so you can make money.

224
00:16:52,914 --> 00:16:54,684
I'm giving you a better option.

225
00:16:55,424 --> 00:16:57,753
Why are you so hesitant? I feel hurt.

226
00:16:59,424 --> 00:17:01,694
Because it doesn't feel like a TA position.

227
00:17:05,633 --> 00:17:06,833
You're clever.

228
00:17:07,963 --> 00:17:10,334
Do you want to know what the job is?

229
00:17:11,003 --> 00:17:12,003
Yes.

230
00:17:14,303 --> 00:17:17,543
Then turn that thing off.

231
00:17:18,174 --> 00:17:19,473
I'll tell you.

232
00:17:19,743 --> 00:17:20,743
What?

233
00:17:21,444 --> 00:17:22,743
Stop recording.

234
00:17:45,573 --> 00:17:48,174
With that naive face,

235
00:17:48,404 --> 00:17:50,443
she asked if she could take photos,

236
00:17:50,444 --> 00:17:52,043
then she turned on the recording app.

237
00:17:56,184 --> 00:17:58,344
I like how shrewd she is.

238
00:17:59,614 --> 00:18:01,184
She's like Hye Jin when she was younger.

239
00:18:02,624 --> 00:18:04,283
Min Ji and Hye Jin are close.

240
00:18:04,983 --> 00:18:06,124
It might not work.

241
00:18:06,253 --> 00:18:08,624
Didn't you hear her say she'd send me her resume?

242
00:18:09,523 --> 00:18:11,462
Kids like her can smell...

243
00:18:11,463 --> 00:18:16,003
what's more profitable and will follow instinctively.

244
00:18:17,733 --> 00:18:20,773
There's no way she can turn down that much money.

245
00:18:22,404 --> 00:18:24,743
Don't worry. Relax, okay?

246
00:18:31,114 --> 00:18:32,584
Hey, Ha Yul.

247
00:18:33,813 --> 00:18:35,924
- Are you going to the academy? - Yes.

248
00:18:36,753 --> 00:18:38,993
You too? To Korean class?

249
00:18:41,094 --> 00:18:42,164
How is it there?

250
00:18:42,694 --> 00:18:44,023
Was it the best choice?

251
00:18:44,523 --> 00:18:45,664
I don't know.

252
00:18:46,263 --> 00:18:47,963
This is my first actual class there.

253
00:18:48,493 --> 00:18:50,803
Oh, I see.

254
00:18:53,533 --> 00:18:55,773
- Ms. Choi. - Yes?

255
00:18:56,503 --> 00:18:57,874
It's nice to meet you.

256
00:18:58,743 --> 00:18:59,844
And a pleasure.

257
00:19:01,144 --> 00:19:03,543
I feel the same. It's good to see you too.

258
00:19:05,684 --> 00:19:07,154
Could you...

259
00:19:07,654 --> 00:19:11,084
give Ms. Seo a message for me?

260
00:19:12,323 --> 00:19:13,924
Is it something you can't say in person?

261
00:19:14,993 --> 00:19:16,523
I can't dare text her...

262
00:19:16,993 --> 00:19:20,334
because I feel so bad and guilty.

263
00:19:20,493 --> 00:19:21,563
What is it about?

264
00:19:21,993 --> 00:19:23,363
If it's to return a textbook...

265
00:19:23,364 --> 00:19:25,604
No, it's not that.

266
00:19:27,334 --> 00:19:29,174
Thank her for me.

267
00:19:30,704 --> 00:19:31,844
She told me...

268
00:19:32,713 --> 00:19:34,713
I could think for myself...

269
00:19:35,114 --> 00:19:37,944
and make my own informed decisions.

270
00:19:38,854 --> 00:19:40,483
Tell her I'll remember that.

271
00:19:41,884 --> 00:19:42,954
Okay.

272
00:19:43,454 --> 00:19:45,793
My mom made me change academies,

273
00:19:47,354 --> 00:19:49,523
but I really liked Ms. Seo a lot.

274
00:19:51,993 --> 00:19:53,164
I'll tell her that for you.

275
00:19:56,533 --> 00:19:59,934
But I liked you a lot too.

276
00:20:01,273 --> 00:20:03,043
Ms. Seo can be scary.

277
00:20:03,973 --> 00:20:05,914
I liked that you were there.

278
00:20:07,513 --> 00:20:09,684
Oh... Okay.

279
00:20:12,313 --> 00:20:15,283
Do you want a soda or something?

280
00:20:15,783 --> 00:20:16,924
I have to get to class.

281
00:20:17,354 --> 00:20:18,793
Right. You do.

282
00:20:19,793 --> 00:20:21,053
See you.

283
00:20:22,023 --> 00:20:23,023
Okay.

284
00:20:42,644 --> 00:20:45,954
I helped both of you prepare your new teaching materials.

285
00:20:46,614 --> 00:20:48,212
If I brought her Mr. Lee's material,

286
00:20:48,213 --> 00:20:50,854
and the kids' and their parents' numbers,

287
00:20:51,154 --> 00:20:53,053
she'd give me a scholarship in return.

288
00:20:54,753 --> 00:20:56,822
She wanted my resume and KSAT score,

289
00:20:56,823 --> 00:20:58,664
and I said I'd send it to her.

290
00:21:03,364 --> 00:21:04,404
Do you want to go?

291
00:21:05,704 --> 00:21:06,733
Yes.

292
00:21:13,243 --> 00:21:15,914
Why are you telling us this, then?

293
00:21:16,414 --> 00:21:18,444
I did some thinking.

294
00:21:18,543 --> 00:21:21,053
Choisun Academy's the best place to go to learn Korean.

295
00:21:23,084 --> 00:21:25,183
What if I were to become your spy...

296
00:21:25,184 --> 00:21:26,223
You're crazy.

297
00:21:29,164 --> 00:21:32,232
I tried to record Ms. Woo, but she found out.

298
00:21:32,233 --> 00:21:33,233
- What? - What?

299
00:21:33,493 --> 00:21:36,433
She told me to get something from Choi Hyung Sun too.

300
00:21:36,434 --> 00:21:38,434
- Things like... - Min Ji.

301
00:21:40,634 --> 00:21:41,704
You don't have to tell us all that.

302
00:21:44,273 --> 00:21:45,813
She said I had a lot to do.

303
00:21:47,114 --> 00:21:48,144
Min Ji.

304
00:21:53,084 --> 00:21:54,954
Were you very offended?

305
00:22:00,624 --> 00:22:01,624
Yes.

306
00:22:05,864 --> 00:22:07,163
I can't stand that...

307
00:22:07,164 --> 00:22:10,433
she treats me like Lee Myeong Jun and Yoon Ji Seok...

308
00:22:10,434 --> 00:22:11,704
just because I'm not well-off.

309
00:22:12,773 --> 00:22:13,833
I'll apologize instead.

310
00:22:13,834 --> 00:22:16,473
Don't send her your resume. You don't have to.

311
00:22:18,944 --> 00:22:20,513
What made me feel worse...

312
00:22:21,144 --> 00:22:24,184
was that I couldn't say no right then and there.

313
00:22:24,344 --> 00:22:25,613
I found myself thinking...

314
00:22:25,614 --> 00:22:27,783
what I'd do once I got the money.

315
00:22:28,783 --> 00:22:30,854
It's okay. You're human.

316
00:22:31,424 --> 00:22:32,424
No.

317
00:22:33,323 --> 00:22:35,894
I could've gone too far if it hadn't been for Ha Yul.

318
00:22:37,563 --> 00:22:39,263
I met her on the way back.

319
00:22:40,763 --> 00:22:42,404
Ha Yul asked me to tell you...

320
00:22:43,533 --> 00:22:45,674
that she liked you a great deal.

321
00:22:47,773 --> 00:22:50,904
She even said she'd liked me too.

322
00:22:52,713 --> 00:22:53,913
You were the reason...

323
00:22:53,914 --> 00:22:56,713
the kids considered me a good teacher.

324
00:22:57,743 --> 00:23:00,654
I felt so embarrassed that I'd forgotten that completely.

325
00:23:03,884 --> 00:23:06,523
I'm just a TA, but I'm half a teacher too.

326
00:23:08,354 --> 00:23:09,424
I want to be...

327
00:23:09,864 --> 00:23:11,394
a good and cool one.

328
00:23:11,594 --> 00:23:13,293
Yes, you are cool.

329
00:23:14,293 --> 00:23:15,634
Without becoming a spy.

330
00:23:20,503 --> 00:23:21,503
Ms. Seo.

331
00:23:21,973 --> 00:23:23,003
I want to help.

332
00:23:24,374 --> 00:23:26,313
I'm your assistant.

333
00:23:29,684 --> 00:23:30,783
Thanks, but no thanks.

334
00:23:32,283 --> 00:23:36,023
I want to be of some help to you.

335
00:23:37,253 --> 00:23:39,094
But I think I'm just weighing you down.

336
00:23:41,194 --> 00:23:42,253
It's so upsetting.

337
00:25:41,114 --> 00:25:43,513
Hey. What's going on?

338
00:25:47,053 --> 00:25:48,053
Min Ji.

339
00:25:49,854 --> 00:25:51,253
What's the matter?

340
00:25:52,253 --> 00:25:53,253
What's wrong?

341
00:25:54,753 --> 00:25:56,963
Oh, dear. What is it, Min Ji?

342
00:25:59,134 --> 00:26:00,134
Goodness.

343
00:26:06,473 --> 00:26:07,604
It's okay.

344
00:26:21,713 --> 00:26:23,483
I thought I only had to persuade the instructors.

345
00:26:25,684 --> 00:26:27,094
I didn't think of this.

346
00:26:31,394 --> 00:26:32,993
You might pass out.

347
00:26:33,963 --> 00:26:36,003
Drink some water.

348
00:26:36,204 --> 00:26:37,233
I was crazy.

349
00:26:38,003 --> 00:26:39,174
I was out of it.

350
00:26:43,273 --> 00:26:44,743
I dragged my students into this...

351
00:26:45,543 --> 00:26:47,344
only to let them all down.

352
00:26:52,684 --> 00:26:55,384
I'm worse than a bug if I don't do anything.

353
00:26:57,954 --> 00:26:59,022
What will you do?

354
00:26:59,023 --> 00:27:01,823
I'll bite Woo Seung Hui's ankle if I must, like a bug.

355
00:27:02,223 --> 00:27:04,023
Bite her at the wrong time, and she'll stomp on you.

356
00:27:04,124 --> 00:27:05,563
Then I'll fold myself in half...

357
00:27:06,963 --> 00:27:07,993
and beg.

358
00:27:08,094 --> 00:27:09,604
I don't care how I look.

359
00:27:12,063 --> 00:27:13,604
- Try to be cool-headed. - I don't want to.

360
00:27:14,834 --> 00:27:16,043
I can't stand it.

361
00:27:17,174 --> 00:27:18,174
Darn it.

362
00:27:20,313 --> 00:27:21,344
It's not Woo Seung Hui.

363
00:27:23,743 --> 00:27:25,783
If you're going to rip into someone, go after the right target.

364
00:27:28,384 --> 00:27:29,983
I met Mr. Pyo yesterday.

365
00:27:30,684 --> 00:27:32,223
Something felt off ever since,

366
00:27:32,993 --> 00:27:35,194
and I realized why just now.

367
00:28:23,374 --> 00:28:25,444
(Daechi Park Realtor)

368
00:29:00,174 --> 00:29:01,213
I feel much better now.

369
00:29:04,283 --> 00:29:05,283
Why aren't you eating?

370
00:29:06,654 --> 00:29:08,154
Did Hye Jin cook you hangover soup?

371
00:29:10,483 --> 00:29:13,493
But then, she's not the type to do that.

372
00:29:13,793 --> 00:29:15,793
- A woman should... - Are you scared of Ms. Woo?

373
00:29:19,194 --> 00:29:20,194
What?

374
00:29:20,263 --> 00:29:22,033
She favours Yoon Ji Seok,

375
00:29:22,733 --> 00:29:25,233
and she offered Ms. Seo's material to anyone and everyone.

376
00:29:25,503 --> 00:29:27,374
And yet you never pushed back.

377
00:29:28,874 --> 00:29:30,073
Isn't it because you're scared of her?

378
00:29:32,174 --> 00:29:33,313
Watch what you say.

379
00:29:34,414 --> 00:29:36,114
We're not yet on the same side.

380
00:29:36,983 --> 00:29:38,944
I'm telling you you don't have to fear her.

381
00:29:39,753 --> 00:29:40,813
Woo Seung Hui, I mean.

382
00:30:04,543 --> 00:30:06,072
(Hall of Fame)

383
00:30:06,073 --> 00:30:07,644
(Lee Jun Ho)

384
00:30:21,323 --> 00:30:22,323
No regrets.

385
00:31:04,733 --> 00:31:05,733
So what?

386
00:31:06,003 --> 00:31:07,874
The kids starting 12th grade.

387
00:31:08,834 --> 00:31:11,104
It's my duty to teach them for at least one more semester.

388
00:31:11,973 --> 00:31:13,043
"Your duty?"

389
00:31:13,513 --> 00:31:14,513
Gosh.

390
00:31:16,013 --> 00:31:18,513
You cared about something that great?

391
00:31:18,783 --> 00:31:21,584
More than anything, you'll need that much time...

392
00:31:23,184 --> 00:31:25,184
to cement your standing over there.

393
00:31:25,454 --> 00:31:26,493
What?

394
00:31:27,723 --> 00:31:29,694
You don't think I have enough influence?

395
00:31:33,634 --> 00:31:34,634
Pyo Sang Seob.

396
00:31:35,664 --> 00:31:37,062
He's Choisun Academy's vice-director,

397
00:31:37,063 --> 00:31:39,404
and even he doesn't have a clue what's going on.

398
00:31:40,874 --> 00:31:41,904
Choi Hyung Sun told him...

399
00:31:43,043 --> 00:31:45,573
how she runs the academy is her own right.

400
00:31:48,174 --> 00:31:50,343
We lose everything the moment we join Choisun Academy...

401
00:31:50,344 --> 00:31:52,013
where you have zero influence.

402
00:31:54,253 --> 00:31:57,053
I want to move once you prove yourself there.

403
00:31:58,553 --> 00:31:59,553
Or...

404
00:32:00,894 --> 00:32:03,164
If you signed something with Choi Hyung Sun,

405
00:32:04,023 --> 00:32:05,164
you could show me that.

406
00:32:08,463 --> 00:32:10,263
Is that your idea, Myeong Jun?

407
00:32:11,834 --> 00:32:13,773
Ms. Seo's with Ms. Choi right now.

408
00:32:15,803 --> 00:32:18,073
What Choi Hyung Sun really wants is Seo Hye Jin.

409
00:32:19,573 --> 00:32:21,444
A worker bee who will gather students...

410
00:32:21,543 --> 00:32:23,013
and bring in honey.

411
00:32:24,914 --> 00:32:28,154
Anyone who dreams of being a queen is just a target.

412
00:32:28,753 --> 00:32:30,783
(Choisun Academy)

413
00:32:34,354 --> 00:32:35,424
Come in.

414
00:32:41,694 --> 00:32:43,864
If Ms. Seo decides to work for Ms. Choi...

415
00:32:44,033 --> 00:32:45,503
Will Ms. Choi still want you?

416
00:32:46,674 --> 00:32:48,233
That's what I don't know.

417
00:33:05,253 --> 00:33:07,323
(Victory)

418
00:33:20,503 --> 00:33:21,874
I'll wait to hear from you.

419
00:33:51,364 --> 00:33:53,773
Your students got some pretty good results.

420
00:33:55,374 --> 00:33:57,404
Your students must've done just as well,

421
00:33:57,773 --> 00:33:59,473
though not as well as mine.

422
00:34:00,513 --> 00:34:01,543
They did okay.

423
00:34:02,874 --> 00:34:03,944
It felt worthwhile.

424
00:34:04,283 --> 00:34:05,283
Good.

425
00:34:05,644 --> 00:34:07,753
That is what keeps you going.

426
00:34:08,753 --> 00:34:10,283
And it forms a foothold for a comeback.

427
00:34:10,384 --> 00:34:11,424
A comeback?

428
00:34:14,354 --> 00:34:15,423
Do you think...

429
00:34:17,294 --> 00:34:18,664
I'll be able to make a comeback?

430
00:34:18,823 --> 00:34:21,033
Yes, of course. You're still young.

431
00:34:22,593 --> 00:34:25,434
Aren't you underestimating your accomplishments?

432
00:34:25,834 --> 00:34:27,803
You crushed me completely.

433
00:34:32,473 --> 00:34:34,914
How am I to make a living from here on?

434
00:34:36,414 --> 00:34:39,814
You came all the way here to ask me that?

435
00:34:40,653 --> 00:34:41,684
Yes.

436
00:34:42,653 --> 00:34:44,124
I thought you'd know the answer.

437
00:34:45,084 --> 00:34:46,254
You know what it takes to win.

438
00:34:46,693 --> 00:34:49,964
You barged into a high school to claim victory over a teacher.

439
00:34:50,093 --> 00:34:52,693
You ran an advertisement campaign that provoked me.

440
00:34:53,464 --> 00:34:56,363
Out of the blue, you played the role of a dedicated educator.

441
00:34:57,464 --> 00:34:59,363
Seo Hye Jin is one impressive woman.

442
00:34:59,564 --> 00:35:01,374
But that impressive Seo Hye Jin...

443
00:35:04,073 --> 00:35:05,403
has lost her way.

444
00:35:07,374 --> 00:35:08,973
What would you do if you were me?

445
00:35:09,314 --> 00:35:10,314
If I was in your shoes,

446
00:35:11,283 --> 00:35:12,343
I'd come to Choi Hyung Sun...

447
00:35:13,414 --> 00:35:15,383
along with my beloved students.

448
00:35:15,754 --> 00:35:19,454
Then, I'd get on the big stage that is by Choi Hyung Sun's design.

449
00:35:20,553 --> 00:35:23,523
The duo at the heart of the illicit scandal.

450
00:35:23,524 --> 00:35:25,464
A teacher and student sally forth, season two.

451
00:35:27,863 --> 00:35:30,363
I'd also use Lee Si Woo as a carnival barker.

452
00:35:30,434 --> 00:35:34,173
Then, everyone will take a number and get in line.

453
00:35:35,173 --> 00:35:37,603
You will be ridiculed at first,

454
00:35:37,604 --> 00:35:40,243
but your lectures speak for themselves.

455
00:35:41,374 --> 00:35:43,743
Even Heewon High's top student takes your classes.

456
00:35:44,644 --> 00:35:46,383
Once that rumour spreads,

457
00:35:46,914 --> 00:35:49,513
you could even take on KSAT retakers.

458
00:35:50,323 --> 00:35:53,493
Others would be willing to pay for a scandal like that.

459
00:35:57,024 --> 00:35:58,124
Does that intrigue you?

460
00:36:13,473 --> 00:36:15,144
You lack perception...

461
00:36:16,343 --> 00:36:18,442
for someone who teaches Korean.

462
00:36:18,443 --> 00:36:21,113
There isn't anyone but me in Daechi-dong...

463
00:36:21,383 --> 00:36:22,513
who can write a scenario like that.

464
00:36:22,954 --> 00:36:25,484
But nothing so far...

465
00:36:27,093 --> 00:36:28,222
has gone your way.

466
00:36:28,223 --> 00:36:29,223
As if.

467
00:36:29,454 --> 00:36:31,323
You sent a spy to our free lecture...

468
00:36:31,863 --> 00:36:34,394
just to see what we'd be teaching.

469
00:36:34,934 --> 00:36:36,663
That's how you lost Si Woo.

470
00:36:36,664 --> 00:36:38,734
That was due to his lack of determination.

471
00:36:38,863 --> 00:36:40,334
You said we were alike...

472
00:36:41,004 --> 00:36:43,473
and suggested that we rule this town.

473
00:36:44,044 --> 00:36:45,403
I turned you down.

474
00:36:48,343 --> 00:36:49,573
Then there was Mr. Pyo.

475
00:36:50,144 --> 00:36:51,414
I bet that one hurt.

476
00:36:52,013 --> 00:36:53,714
The pain was mutual.

477
00:36:54,754 --> 00:36:57,184
You had no idea he was one to turn down...

478
00:36:58,653 --> 00:36:59,794
someone else's teaching materials.

479
00:37:03,164 --> 00:37:04,922
You tried to take all of Chanyoung High students...

480
00:37:04,923 --> 00:37:06,064
with my teaching materials,

481
00:37:06,593 --> 00:37:07,664
but that didn't work either.

482
00:37:09,763 --> 00:37:11,064
So tell me.

483
00:37:11,363 --> 00:37:14,633
What recent event followed your meticulous design...

484
00:37:15,334 --> 00:37:16,374
to a tee?

485
00:37:16,604 --> 00:37:19,144
You're here, aren't you? Ta-da.

486
00:37:19,743 --> 00:37:21,914
You're here asking me how to proceed with your career.

487
00:37:22,443 --> 00:37:24,742
Don't tell me I didn't design this as well.

488
00:37:24,743 --> 00:37:27,052
When did I ask you for advice?

489
00:37:27,053 --> 00:37:28,053
The second you started talking.

490
00:37:28,854 --> 00:37:31,383
I asked what you'd do if you were in my shoes.

491
00:37:32,854 --> 00:37:35,923
Doing the opposite seems like the right way of living.

492
00:37:36,964 --> 00:37:37,964
Morally, I mean.

493
00:37:41,363 --> 00:37:43,803
How can you say you're perceptive when you couldn't tell...

494
00:37:45,604 --> 00:37:46,704
what I was asking?

495
00:38:07,294 --> 00:38:08,454
Bring me some water.

496
00:38:16,633 --> 00:38:17,664
Carry on.

497
00:38:18,403 --> 00:38:19,802
You should've figured it out...

498
00:38:19,803 --> 00:38:21,803
when I suddenly rode the high horse as an educator.

499
00:38:22,673 --> 00:38:25,242
That the path I take is different from yours.

500
00:38:25,243 --> 00:38:27,112
And I said it was hilarious...

501
00:38:27,113 --> 00:38:28,513
for a wrecker to have morals.

502
00:38:28,943 --> 00:38:30,484
- Didn't that settle in? - No.

503
00:38:31,544 --> 00:38:33,184
It actually came as a wake-up call.

504
00:38:34,553 --> 00:38:36,153
There was something I wanted...

505
00:38:37,484 --> 00:38:39,684
other than a long list of students who got into top universities.

506
00:38:40,954 --> 00:38:43,223
For three years, we read, wrote,

507
00:38:43,493 --> 00:38:44,794
laughed, and chatted together.

508
00:38:45,464 --> 00:38:47,394
They'd doze off, and I'd wake them up.

509
00:38:48,093 --> 00:38:50,133
For someone, that time forms their life.

510
00:38:51,564 --> 00:38:52,763
That is what I was able to learn.

511
00:38:55,673 --> 00:38:56,673
Gosh.

512
00:38:59,374 --> 00:39:00,973
Knowing that was your ruin.

513
00:39:02,443 --> 00:39:05,584
That is why you crashed and burned.

514
00:39:06,243 --> 00:39:09,683
Save those noble words of wisdom for social media.

515
00:39:09,684 --> 00:39:11,024
That'll attract students for sure.

516
00:39:13,394 --> 00:39:16,423
This is not the place for your self-complacency.

517
00:39:17,394 --> 00:39:20,693
I thought I warned you about being on moral high ground.

518
00:39:22,294 --> 00:39:23,704
Self-complacency...

519
00:39:25,533 --> 00:39:26,903
is your speciality.

520
00:39:51,164 --> 00:39:53,934
(Victory)

521
00:40:05,374 --> 00:40:06,374
(Power off)

522
00:40:17,823 --> 00:40:19,883
(Choisun Academy, the 1st class formula)

523
00:40:39,673 --> 00:40:41,943
I felt odd every time I came here.

524
00:40:43,943 --> 00:40:46,383
Why is the director's office this far down the hall?

525
00:40:47,954 --> 00:40:50,553
Why is your desk so far from the door?

526
00:40:53,394 --> 00:40:55,193
To meet you,

527
00:40:56,524 --> 00:40:58,794
why does one need to take a long walk?

528
00:40:59,263 --> 00:41:00,993
That is authority.

529
00:41:01,934 --> 00:41:04,533
Something you have never been able to obtain.

530
00:41:06,464 --> 00:41:07,504
I feel sorry for you.

531
00:41:08,803 --> 00:41:09,833
For me?

532
00:41:09,834 --> 00:41:12,104
Those who have the respect of people...

533
00:41:13,414 --> 00:41:16,073
and those who try hard to win others' respect...

534
00:41:18,044 --> 00:41:20,512
don't mistake a mere office as their authority.

535
00:41:20,513 --> 00:41:21,882
Ms. Seo.

536
00:41:21,883 --> 00:41:23,624
Woo Seung Hui met with my assistant.

537
00:41:27,053 --> 00:41:29,024
- And? - I don't know...

538
00:41:29,423 --> 00:41:30,664
what they talked about.

539
00:41:33,363 --> 00:41:35,294
But I'm sure you do.

540
00:41:35,664 --> 00:41:36,734
I don't.

541
00:41:37,734 --> 00:41:39,863
I never said we needed any teaching assistants.

542
00:41:41,403 --> 00:41:42,472
Think about how it felt...

543
00:41:42,473 --> 00:41:44,473
when you sent Si Woo to our free lecture.

544
00:41:46,403 --> 00:41:47,672
Or refer to the moment...

545
00:41:47,673 --> 00:41:49,172
you asked Si Woo to sign that ridiculous memorandum.

546
00:41:49,173 --> 00:41:50,842
I had nothing to do with that.

547
00:41:50,843 --> 00:41:54,184
Then refer to when you told Mr. Pyo to use my teaching materials.

548
00:41:59,283 --> 00:42:01,323
Those scenarios you seem to love to write?

549
00:42:03,223 --> 00:42:04,524
Woo Seung Hui must be writing them too.

550
00:42:06,263 --> 00:42:07,532
Just like you,

551
00:42:07,533 --> 00:42:09,133
she's happily discarding her dignity while doing so.

552
00:42:10,363 --> 00:42:12,303
Without an ounce of shame.

553
00:42:16,104 --> 00:42:19,104
You could even pass for twins.

554
00:42:22,173 --> 00:42:24,513
When you fabricated that story about me and Mr. Lee,

555
00:42:24,584 --> 00:42:26,984
you worked hand in glove with one another.

556
00:42:31,283 --> 00:42:32,883
You met your soulmate,

557
00:42:34,053 --> 00:42:35,093
Ms. Choi.

558
00:42:47,604 --> 00:42:48,903
I'm here to see Ms. Choi.

559
00:42:49,403 --> 00:42:51,274
She's with someone.

560
00:42:51,704 --> 00:42:53,104
Tell her that Lee Jun Ho is here.

561
00:42:54,414 --> 00:42:55,414
From Daechi Chase.

562
00:42:59,414 --> 00:43:00,414
Let them in.

563
00:43:33,513 --> 00:43:35,153
If you were going to jump ship,

564
00:43:36,214 --> 00:43:37,684
why not come to me first?

565
00:43:37,923 --> 00:43:38,923
I'm a little upset.

566
00:43:40,823 --> 00:43:42,493
You don't like me very much.

567
00:43:43,624 --> 00:43:44,663
Why would I talk to you...

568
00:43:44,664 --> 00:43:46,593
when I could talk to someone who likes me?

569
00:43:50,863 --> 00:43:51,934
Have a seat.

570
00:43:52,133 --> 00:43:53,972
Ms. Seo is being a bit cheeky.

571
00:43:53,973 --> 00:43:55,504
I'm upset with you too.

572
00:43:57,173 --> 00:43:59,643
The second you got her call, you should've...

573
00:43:59,644 --> 00:44:02,813
If you have eyes, I suggest that you read the room.

574
00:44:02,814 --> 00:44:05,144
You should've discussed this with me first.

575
00:44:05,613 --> 00:44:07,653
Then you wouldn't be in this situation.

576
00:44:07,783 --> 00:44:08,814
I should've discussed it?

577
00:44:08,984 --> 00:44:09,984
Don't tell me...

578
00:44:10,553 --> 00:44:12,983
you're thinking about contacting our instructors...

579
00:44:12,984 --> 00:44:15,394
without me being a bridge for you.

580
00:44:16,193 --> 00:44:17,464
That I recommend.

581
00:44:18,064 --> 00:44:19,723
- Contact them yourself. - Why you...

582
00:44:19,823 --> 00:44:21,664
Isn't it a courtesy...

583
00:44:21,763 --> 00:44:23,632
to greet your elders first and then talk?

584
00:44:23,633 --> 00:44:25,564
It's funny you're asking for one given our situation.

585
00:44:27,204 --> 00:44:30,103
Ms. Woo is a pro at gaining leverage on people,

586
00:44:30,104 --> 00:44:31,573
but she's the worst at winning favours with them.

587
00:44:32,144 --> 00:44:36,314
Today, she was stabbed in the back by her right-hand man.

588
00:44:37,783 --> 00:44:39,544
Draft your own contracts.

589
00:44:40,214 --> 00:44:41,584
I say that for Choisun Academy's sake.

590
00:44:46,354 --> 00:44:48,823
I'll leave and let you two talk.

591
00:44:54,064 --> 00:44:55,064
Wait.

592
00:44:56,664 --> 00:44:57,664
I wish luck...

593
00:44:59,863 --> 00:45:00,973
to you soulmates.

594
00:45:06,943 --> 00:45:07,973
Good luck.

595
00:45:14,613 --> 00:45:16,783
Will they go their separate ways?

596
00:45:17,323 --> 00:45:18,323
I don't know.

597
00:45:19,484 --> 00:45:20,653
- What... - Gosh.

598
00:45:21,093 --> 00:45:23,124
- Gosh, hello. - What?

599
00:45:24,323 --> 00:45:25,693
What brings you two here?

600
00:45:26,263 --> 00:45:29,064
We came by to talk to Ms. Choi.

601
00:45:29,633 --> 00:45:30,704
I see.

602
00:45:32,263 --> 00:45:33,903
If you're not too busy, join me for tea.

603
00:45:42,743 --> 00:45:43,984
Let us talk seated.

604
00:45:44,113 --> 00:45:45,684
You vacated the studio apartment,

605
00:45:46,843 --> 00:45:48,854
but you didn't discuss that with me either.

606
00:45:49,153 --> 00:45:51,854
You keep saying I should've discussed things with you,

607
00:45:52,923 --> 00:45:56,423
but did you also show me the same courtesy...

608
00:45:57,193 --> 00:45:58,863
before offering a job to an assistant?

609
00:46:00,894 --> 00:46:03,633
Besides, what am I supposed to discuss with someone...

610
00:46:04,033 --> 00:46:05,763
who can't even decently plant a spy among my people?

611
00:46:06,533 --> 00:46:07,734
We'll continue seated.

612
00:46:23,084 --> 00:46:24,754
I guess I gave you a hint.

613
00:46:26,484 --> 00:46:28,323
It's more like you gave us the answer sheet.

614
00:46:29,124 --> 00:46:30,693
If Choi Hyung Sun and Woo Seung Hui part ways, I mean.

615
00:46:35,734 --> 00:46:37,263
Does it worry you?

616
00:46:38,464 --> 00:46:39,464
No.

617
00:46:41,874 --> 00:46:43,173
I learned...

618
00:46:43,874 --> 00:46:46,303
that Ms. Choi needs bitter criticism from time to time.

619
00:46:49,914 --> 00:46:51,943
I'm sorry, but can we continue some other time?

620
00:46:52,113 --> 00:46:53,314
I have things left to do.

621
00:46:54,283 --> 00:46:55,383
Sure.

622
00:46:57,383 --> 00:46:58,954
Seo Hye Jin is cunning.

623
00:46:59,524 --> 00:47:01,354
I don't know what she said, but...

624
00:47:01,593 --> 00:47:04,664
You could even pass for twins.

625
00:47:06,394 --> 00:47:07,664
It was all nonsense.

626
00:47:09,533 --> 00:47:11,363
How can someone who knows that...

627
00:47:11,763 --> 00:47:15,333
accuse me of trying to plant a spy...

628
00:47:15,334 --> 00:47:16,903
among your people?

629
00:47:18,343 --> 00:47:19,473
Is it because...

630
00:47:19,973 --> 00:47:22,673
you are harbouring secrets that I need...

631
00:47:23,214 --> 00:47:24,914
to dig out?

632
00:47:25,584 --> 00:47:26,613
I am.

633
00:47:28,754 --> 00:47:30,084
So try and figure it out.

634
00:47:32,783 --> 00:47:34,192
Ms. Choi.

635
00:47:34,193 --> 00:47:35,923
How much time should I give you?

636
00:47:36,593 --> 00:47:38,723
A year? Two?

637
00:47:38,863 --> 00:47:42,393
Or should I give you ten years which is the amount of time...

638
00:47:42,394 --> 00:47:43,734
you worked at Daechi Chase?

639
00:47:44,564 --> 00:47:46,504
All while rooting you on...

640
00:47:46,803 --> 00:47:48,004
every time you fail?

641
00:47:48,104 --> 00:47:49,374
You ought...

642
00:47:51,044 --> 00:47:53,604
to speak to me with respect.

643
00:47:55,113 --> 00:47:56,442
We're partners in this.

644
00:47:56,443 --> 00:47:58,242
You have to bring an equal amount of game...

645
00:47:58,243 --> 00:47:59,684
to be considered a partner.

646
00:48:01,754 --> 00:48:04,524
You don't know about the people you're trying to win over...

647
00:48:04,823 --> 00:48:07,653
or about the game Seo Hye Jin has set up.

648
00:48:07,693 --> 00:48:09,794
You don't even know what my dark secret is.

649
00:48:11,923 --> 00:48:13,723
Someone that slow-witted...

650
00:48:14,263 --> 00:48:16,434
should just be good at following orders.

651
00:48:17,664 --> 00:48:19,464
Sit when you're told.

652
00:48:19,564 --> 00:48:21,303
Listen when I speak.

653
00:48:21,573 --> 00:48:24,173
And don't do things you weren't told to do.

654
00:48:28,774 --> 00:48:30,613
I won't have any of our instructors...

655
00:48:32,044 --> 00:48:33,584
teach at this academy.

656
00:48:34,013 --> 00:48:35,714
That is music to my ears.

657
00:48:36,354 --> 00:48:37,584
I'll handle it from here.

658
00:48:38,124 --> 00:48:40,254
Gosh. While I'm at it,

659
00:48:40,423 --> 00:48:43,354
maybe I should offer Director Kim a job.

660
00:48:43,964 --> 00:48:45,723
He seems like a generous boss.

661
00:48:47,894 --> 00:48:48,894
What?

662
00:48:50,164 --> 00:48:51,403
He'd have to be generous...

663
00:48:51,863 --> 00:48:54,573
to let you work for him for ten years.

664
00:49:07,984 --> 00:49:09,383
It was 8 years and 9 months.

665
00:49:13,053 --> 00:49:16,954
(Choisun Academy, the 1st class formula)

666
00:49:50,423 --> 00:49:53,164
- Woo Seung Hui! - Ms. Choi!

667
00:49:53,363 --> 00:49:55,394
- Help! - Please don't.

668
00:49:56,363 --> 00:49:57,963
- What's going on? - Stop this.

669
00:49:57,964 --> 00:49:59,902
No, you let go!

670
00:49:59,903 --> 00:50:02,234
- Let go, darn it. - Woo Seung Hui!

671
00:50:02,303 --> 00:50:04,842
- Let go of her. - Ms. Choi, let go.

672
00:50:04,843 --> 00:50:06,543
- Stop this. - What's wrong with you?

673
00:50:06,544 --> 00:50:08,742
- Woo Seung Hui! - Please let go.

674
00:50:08,743 --> 00:50:11,044
- Gosh, no. - Stop!

675
00:50:11,214 --> 00:50:13,513
Stop!

676
00:50:14,013 --> 00:50:16,013
- I can't believe this. - Ladies, please.

677
00:50:16,414 --> 00:50:19,883
You'll let go at the same time on the count of three.

678
00:50:20,794 --> 00:50:24,664
All right. One, two, three.

679
00:50:25,093 --> 00:50:26,922
- Seriously? - What's the matter with them?

680
00:50:26,923 --> 00:50:29,693
- Let go! - I'll count to three again.

681
00:50:29,763 --> 00:50:31,733
- Please let go. - One.

682
00:50:31,734 --> 00:50:33,704
- Darn you. - One!

683
00:50:34,033 --> 00:50:36,072
- Please let go. - Help us.

684
00:50:36,073 --> 00:50:37,573
Ms. Choi, please let go.

685
00:50:38,303 --> 00:50:40,402
- Let go. - Darn you!

686
00:50:40,403 --> 00:50:42,543
- Please let go, Ms. Choi. - Stop this!

687
00:50:42,544 --> 00:50:44,684
- Talk it out instead. - Let go of her.

688
00:50:45,544 --> 00:50:47,584
- Unbelievable. - Pull.

689
00:50:48,053 --> 00:50:50,953
- Ms. Choi, loosen your grip. - Ms. Choi, please.

690
00:50:50,954 --> 00:50:52,783
- Please... - Loosen your grip.

691
00:51:09,073 --> 00:51:10,334
I slept for too long, didn't I?

692
00:51:11,104 --> 00:51:12,243
Are you up?

693
00:51:14,874 --> 00:51:16,243
You slept for a while.

694
00:51:16,513 --> 00:51:17,513
Hold on.

695
00:51:18,814 --> 00:51:21,053
You're not burning up as much.

696
00:51:21,383 --> 00:51:22,853
How do you feel? Are you all right?

697
00:51:22,854 --> 00:51:24,653
Yes. I feel better now.

698
00:51:26,024 --> 00:51:27,084
Have some water.

699
00:51:36,564 --> 00:51:37,734
I bet I startled you.

700
00:51:39,033 --> 00:51:40,334
I was inconsiderate.

701
00:51:41,073 --> 00:51:42,504
You haven't been able to sleep or eat.

702
00:51:42,633 --> 00:51:44,104
On top of that, you cried until your body gave in.

703
00:51:45,144 --> 00:51:46,243
I'm fine.

704
00:51:48,613 --> 00:51:50,044
What is it? Do you need something?

705
00:51:50,214 --> 00:51:52,143
Where's my phone? I need to call Min Ji.

706
00:51:52,144 --> 00:51:53,984
- Where... - I called her for you.

707
00:52:00,524 --> 00:52:01,553
Gosh.

708
00:52:10,193 --> 00:52:12,164
What I saw really happened, didn't it?

709
00:52:14,533 --> 00:52:16,504
Choi Hyung Sun and Woo Seung Hui.

710
00:52:18,403 --> 00:52:21,144
Their video has gone more viral than trending blockbusters.

711
00:52:23,274 --> 00:52:24,513
The kids filmed it.

712
00:52:27,914 --> 00:52:29,553
Rumour has it...

713
00:52:29,914 --> 00:52:31,484
that the enraged ladies...

714
00:52:31,653 --> 00:52:33,723
will probably sue one another.

715
00:52:34,854 --> 00:52:37,823
No way. I can't believe Woo Seung Hui.

716
00:52:45,403 --> 00:52:47,363
During spring break, you'll start working out.

717
00:52:48,874 --> 00:52:49,874
How am I going to stay with you...

718
00:52:49,874 --> 00:52:50,874
for the rest of my life if you're like this?

719
00:52:57,584 --> 00:52:58,743
You'll do what?

720
00:52:59,484 --> 00:53:02,113
It's upsetting to see you surprised.

721
00:53:05,053 --> 00:53:06,484
Aren't you going to be with me?

722
00:53:23,033 --> 00:53:24,303
Have you had dinner?

723
00:53:25,903 --> 00:53:27,104
I had a light meal.

724
00:53:27,644 --> 00:53:28,774
Why? Are you hungry?

725
00:53:32,544 --> 00:53:34,084
I want ice cream.

726
00:53:34,513 --> 00:53:35,553
Ice cream?

727
00:53:38,823 --> 00:53:39,823
Hold on.

728
00:53:42,693 --> 00:53:43,723
Will it be okay?

729
00:53:44,723 --> 00:53:47,793
At this moment though when I'm saying something important?

730
00:53:47,794 --> 00:53:48,934
That's exactly why.

731
00:53:52,734 --> 00:53:53,863
Can you get me some?

732
00:53:56,504 --> 00:53:57,573
Sure.

733
00:54:06,243 --> 00:54:07,314
What flavour?

734
00:54:11,124 --> 00:54:12,153
Got it.

735
00:54:15,854 --> 00:54:17,793
You'll let go at the same time...

736
00:54:17,794 --> 00:54:19,823
- on the count of three. - Is this for real?

737
00:54:21,294 --> 00:54:24,133
- No, don't film this. - Three.

738
00:54:24,334 --> 00:54:25,934
This is insane.

739
00:54:27,164 --> 00:54:28,604
What's with their fighting spirit?

740
00:54:29,774 --> 00:54:31,603
- Crazy, isn't it? - Yes.

741
00:54:31,604 --> 00:54:33,144
- Please let go. - One.

742
00:54:33,504 --> 00:54:35,544
Let go. Darn it.

743
00:54:36,173 --> 00:54:38,882
My mom should work out.

744
00:54:38,883 --> 00:54:41,253
- Let go. - Darn you!

745
00:54:41,254 --> 00:54:42,754
To run an academy,

746
00:54:43,084 --> 00:54:45,954
one needs a strong grip, stamina, and guts.

747
00:54:46,484 --> 00:54:47,794
That seems like it.

748
00:54:51,064 --> 00:54:53,193
Let's get going while the bus is still running.

749
00:54:59,334 --> 00:55:00,604
Should I get a car?

750
00:55:02,434 --> 00:55:05,104
You can if you can afford it.

751
00:55:05,274 --> 00:55:06,343
But why?

752
00:55:07,343 --> 00:55:10,274
It's sad how you're always rushed by when public transportation ends.

753
00:55:12,013 --> 00:55:13,443
That's not the case.

754
00:55:13,613 --> 00:55:15,354
There's a thing called cabs.

755
00:55:16,454 --> 00:55:19,423
I feel bad about being a boyfriend who doesn't have a car.

756
00:55:23,823 --> 00:55:25,163
- Sir. - Yes?

757
00:55:25,164 --> 00:55:27,733
Can we get a bottle of soju and the daily special?

758
00:55:27,734 --> 00:55:29,263
- Okay. - Thanks.

759
00:55:30,394 --> 00:55:31,434
That's out of the blue.

760
00:55:32,633 --> 00:55:33,803
All right. Let's now dive...

761
00:55:34,973 --> 00:55:36,973
into a deep conversation.

762
00:55:37,704 --> 00:55:38,743
Sit.

763
00:55:39,443 --> 00:55:41,743
Right. Got it.

764
00:55:46,714 --> 00:55:48,084
What's your thesis about?

765
00:55:48,383 --> 00:55:50,754
My thesis? That's out of the blue.

766
00:55:51,053 --> 00:55:52,153
Tell me.

767
00:55:56,193 --> 00:55:58,464
I'll talk all night if you let me.

768
00:55:58,763 --> 00:56:00,164
That's why I ordered drinks.

769
00:56:03,763 --> 00:56:04,863
Well...

770
00:56:05,734 --> 00:56:07,803
The era in question is the Song Dynasty.

771
00:56:10,973 --> 00:56:12,044
Hold on.

772
00:56:12,903 --> 00:56:14,573
Let me know why this is happening first.

773
00:56:16,714 --> 00:56:17,783
I don't care...

774
00:56:18,743 --> 00:56:21,283
even if you're never able to buy a car.

775
00:56:23,013 --> 00:56:25,883
A car? I could buy one for you tomorrow.

776
00:56:28,553 --> 00:56:30,993
I'm touched by your offer,

777
00:56:32,093 --> 00:56:34,363
but what does that have to do with my thesis?

778
00:56:34,964 --> 00:56:35,993
But...

779
00:56:37,394 --> 00:56:38,934
don't you ever...

780
00:56:39,104 --> 00:56:41,673
play the poor and broke grad student card again.

781
00:56:42,734 --> 00:56:44,573
Sorry about that.

782
00:56:45,403 --> 00:56:46,774
If you want to eat something pricey,

783
00:56:47,004 --> 00:56:48,874
come to me instead of Mr. Lee.

784
00:56:50,044 --> 00:56:51,544
Get your doctor's degree too if that's what you want.

785
00:56:52,084 --> 00:56:53,914
Never graduate if you don't want to.

786
00:56:55,153 --> 00:56:56,153
Either way,

787
00:56:56,584 --> 00:56:59,283
see through whatever it is that you're studying...

788
00:57:01,593 --> 00:57:03,153
so that a mere academy instructor can't show off...

789
00:57:03,354 --> 00:57:04,794
just because he earns more than enough money.

790
00:57:14,874 --> 00:57:16,704
What is it? What's wrong?

791
00:57:17,533 --> 00:57:19,303
I don't deserve you.

792
00:57:27,013 --> 00:57:28,084
You're adorable.

793
00:57:31,423 --> 00:57:32,454

I can't imagine myself...

813

without you.

814
00:59:47,783 --> 00:59:49,423

815

816

Are you disappointed?

817
01:00:00,133 --> 01:00:01,234
Quite deeply.

818
01:00:03,934 --> 01:00:05,742
Can't you start giving it some thought starting today?

819
01:00:05,743 --> 01:00:07,004
I can't do that...

820
01:00:10,544 --> 01:00:12,513
because my future seems way too bleak.

821
01:00:15,013 --> 01:00:16,683
We can get the students back.

822
01:00:16,684 --> 01:00:17,984
It's not about that.

823
01:00:20,783 --> 01:00:21,894
The academy...

824
01:00:27,593 --> 01:00:29,294
I think I can quit.

825
01:00:33,734 --> 01:00:35,374
The year you got accepted into the university,

826
01:00:35,633 --> 01:00:37,803
Mr. Kim bought me a used car.

827
01:00:39,803 --> 01:00:40,803
I remember that.

828
01:00:41,243 --> 01:00:43,173
You got the car before you could get your license.

829
01:00:45,544 --> 01:00:47,243
That was enough to make me feel proud.

830
01:00:48,584 --> 01:00:51,354
I was clearly the poorest one among my friends.

831
01:00:51,723 --> 01:00:53,184
But it felt like my status had changed.

832
01:00:54,854 --> 01:00:56,593
I was over the moon, so I worked really hard.

833
01:00:57,993 --> 01:00:59,963
Later on, I forgot what for I was making money.

834
01:00:59,964 --> 01:01:01,564
Chasing the money became my goal.

835
01:01:03,593 --> 01:01:05,464
I started this job to pay the tuition for my studies.

836
01:01:05,533 --> 01:01:07,433
But I barely spent time on my own studies.

837
01:01:07,434 --> 01:01:08,734
I only managed to pass my classes.

838
01:01:11,673 --> 01:01:12,774
But...

839
01:01:14,274 --> 01:01:16,073
after losing almost all of my students,

840
01:01:16,544 --> 01:01:17,644
I was reminded again...

841
01:01:19,343 --> 01:01:21,454
why I wanted to earn money.

842
01:01:23,783 --> 01:01:24,823
Funny. Isn't it?

843
01:01:26,254 --> 01:01:27,254
Not at all.

844
01:01:29,024 --> 01:01:31,763
You told me that everything I built crumbled away because of me.

845
01:01:32,863 --> 01:01:35,863
But you were wrong. I don't think that's true.

846
01:01:40,464 --> 01:01:42,504
It's the contrary. Should I say...

847
01:01:42,704 --> 01:01:45,303
the fog that was covering my eyes for a long time finally lifted?

848
01:01:49,573 --> 01:01:51,044
Then I saw it.

849
01:01:53,414 --> 01:01:55,714
I saw the long-overdue studies I had been putting off.

850
01:02:01,084 --> 01:02:02,754
I can't guarantee any results.

851
01:02:04,254 --> 01:02:06,363
I don't know how long it will take for me to finish.

852
01:02:06,794 --> 01:02:09,734
But if I were to achieve something then,

853
01:02:10,693 --> 01:02:12,234
you could give it to me then.

854
01:02:14,164 --> 01:02:15,234
My well-deserved diploma.

855
01:02:23,343 --> 01:02:24,843
I'll give you everything you want.

856
01:02:26,644 --> 01:02:27,684
Thank you.

857
01:02:29,814 --> 01:02:32,283
But whatever you decide to do,

858
01:02:33,323 --> 01:02:34,894
let me support you.

859
01:02:40,964 --> 01:02:42,164
I'll wait for your answer.

860
01:02:46,263 --> 01:02:47,303
How sweet.

861
01:02:52,073 --> 01:02:53,803
I'm going to work.

862
01:02:54,874 --> 01:02:56,113
Mom, wait!

863
01:02:56,714 --> 01:02:59,184
What? What is it?

864
01:02:59,984 --> 01:03:01,144
Mom, hold on.

865
01:03:01,854 --> 01:03:03,153
Could you sit there for a moment?

866
01:03:03,383 --> 01:03:05,323
What? Do you need money?

867
01:03:05,653 --> 01:03:06,854
Sit down.

868
01:03:09,153 --> 01:03:10,223
What is it?

869
01:03:15,294 --> 01:03:16,533
Mom, help me get married.

870
01:03:19,434 --> 01:03:20,464
I must get married.

871
01:03:22,234 --> 01:03:23,303
Do you have a girlfriend?

872
01:03:24,004 --> 01:03:25,943
Why would I ask if I didn't?

873
01:03:28,144 --> 01:03:29,513
What does she do?

874
01:03:29,644 --> 01:03:31,274
How old is she? How long have you been dating her?

875
01:03:33,314 --> 01:03:34,343
It's Ms. Nam Cheong Mi.

876
01:03:37,883 --> 01:03:40,124
Here's what a lot of my married friends told me.

877
01:03:41,153 --> 01:03:42,223
When I meet the one I'm destined to marry,

878
01:03:42,693 --> 01:03:44,354
I'll know it the moment I meet her.

879
01:03:47,894 --> 01:03:50,593
I think I will end up becoming her husband.

880
01:03:54,204 --> 01:03:55,874
You bought an apartment in Pyeongchon, right?

881
01:03:57,274 --> 01:03:58,343
Can I have that?

882
01:03:59,104 --> 01:04:00,943
And help us open up an academy in that neighbourhood.

883
01:04:01,573 --> 01:04:02,613
I want that to be my wedding gift.

884
01:04:06,584 --> 01:04:07,644
Gosh.

885
01:04:09,084 --> 01:04:10,084
What?

886
01:04:38,283 --> 01:04:39,644
You're here early.

887
01:04:45,454 --> 01:04:46,484
Hey.

888
01:04:48,354 --> 01:04:50,024
You seem quite absorbed in it. What is it?

889
01:04:50,254 --> 01:04:51,524
You didn't even notice me coming in.

890
01:04:53,823 --> 01:04:55,164
I was watching lecture videos of the top-tier instructors.

891
01:04:59,464 --> 01:05:01,834
I also watch yours and Mr. Lee's lecture videos.

892
01:05:03,073 --> 01:05:04,073
Mine?

893
01:05:05,973 --> 01:05:07,274
I'm quite motivated...

894
01:05:07,903 --> 01:05:09,414
because my colleagues are so talented.

895
01:05:15,053 --> 01:05:17,414
Do you come in this early every day? I didn't know.

896
01:05:18,254 --> 01:05:20,954
I do. I'm an ambitious type.

897
01:05:23,124 --> 01:05:24,124
I'll let you finish.

898
01:05:27,664 --> 01:05:29,032
- Good morning. - Hello.

899
01:05:29,033 --> 01:05:30,164
- Hello. - Hello.

900
01:05:32,033 --> 01:05:33,863
- You're here early. - Of course.

901
01:05:38,073 --> 01:05:39,403
Let's see.

902
01:05:49,113 --> 01:05:50,184
My son.

903
01:05:51,153 --> 01:05:53,484
Don't goof around. I need you to be serious right now.

904
01:05:54,684 --> 01:05:56,323
I told you everything.

905
01:05:56,993 --> 01:05:59,164
How could I be more serious than this?

906
01:06:00,923 --> 01:06:01,964
Gosh.

907
01:06:04,064 --> 01:06:06,504
"What's the use of your studies?"

908
01:06:07,263 --> 01:06:08,673
"When will you become a professor?"

909
01:06:09,434 --> 01:06:11,573
She was the only one who never asked me these things.

910
01:06:14,743 --> 01:06:15,943
She gives me...

911
01:06:16,673 --> 01:06:18,214
a strong sense of certainty.

912
01:06:20,414 --> 01:06:23,113
Does she like you back?

913
01:06:23,454 --> 01:06:24,454
Really?

914
01:06:26,423 --> 01:06:28,184
Are you more concerned about her feelings than mine?

915
01:06:30,053 --> 01:06:32,164
Are you sure she's into you?

916
01:06:35,734 --> 01:06:36,993
Open an academy in Pyeongchon.

917
01:06:38,164 --> 01:06:40,004
With that, I'll be able to make sure she's completely into me.

918
01:06:40,903 --> 01:06:41,934
Do you think I'm crazy?

919
01:06:44,673 --> 01:06:46,274
Why go that far?

920
01:06:47,544 --> 01:06:49,374
If she wants to make it as an instructor, it should be here.

921
01:06:51,343 --> 01:06:52,383
What?

922
01:06:58,153 --> 01:07:01,153
(Vice-director's Office)

923
01:07:26,684 --> 01:07:29,584
(Daechi Chase)

924
01:07:50,434 --> 01:07:52,374
Why are you looking at me like that?

925
01:07:53,403 --> 01:07:55,172
Everyone knew that...

926
01:07:55,173 --> 01:07:58,882
I wanted to open up an academy at one point.

927
01:07:58,883 --> 01:08:00,443
Yes. That's true. But...

928
01:08:01,754 --> 01:08:04,754
Wait. So...

929
01:08:05,854 --> 01:08:08,184
Academies and reputations go hand in hand.

930
01:08:08,894 --> 01:08:11,193
Gosh. You've gotten this far with Daechi Chase.

931
01:08:11,254 --> 01:08:14,592
I thought it would be a great waste to let it fade away.

932
01:08:14,593 --> 01:08:17,463
So you're telling me...

933
01:08:17,464 --> 01:08:20,133
Keep paying the instructors.

934
01:08:20,634 --> 01:08:22,474
Money is a great way of showing support.

935
01:08:23,403 --> 01:08:25,874
Besides, we must prepare for the next semester.

936
01:08:26,903 --> 01:08:30,014
You ought to hold a big recruitment event like before.

937
01:08:36,514 --> 01:08:38,554
I'm sure you have demands.

938
01:08:43,594 --> 01:08:44,794
Please tell me.

939
01:08:44,993 --> 01:08:47,224
You can move into the vice-director's office tomorrow.

940
01:08:47,393 --> 01:08:49,593
No. You can even move in there today.

941
01:08:49,594 --> 01:08:51,764
Gosh. No.

942
01:08:53,704 --> 01:08:55,103
Well,

943
01:08:55,603 --> 01:08:56,874
since you asked,

944
01:08:58,474 --> 01:09:00,943
- I do have one condition. - Please.

945
01:09:02,643 --> 01:09:04,474
I want you to support...

946
01:09:05,483 --> 01:09:09,554
Ms. Nam as the new face of the academy.

947
01:09:13,353 --> 01:09:17,094
Having Ms. Seo...

948
01:09:18,393 --> 01:09:20,794
as the face of our academy...

949
01:09:21,294 --> 01:09:22,664
won't be wise.

950
01:09:23,834 --> 01:09:26,164
Well, yes. I understand your concern.

951
01:09:26,304 --> 01:09:29,203
Ms. Nam is very talented.

952
01:09:29,204 --> 01:09:30,834
She has the potential to become a star instructor too.

953
01:09:31,233 --> 01:09:32,643
She's easy on the eyes too.

954
01:09:34,374 --> 01:09:37,044
She's not lacking in any way. She's indeed smart.

955
01:09:37,143 --> 01:09:38,174
Right.

956
01:09:39,643 --> 01:09:43,183
I understand that you won't be happy with Hye Jin.

957
01:09:43,683 --> 01:09:45,424
But why her of all instructors?

958
01:09:47,153 --> 01:09:49,393
She has what it takes to be an instructor...

959
01:09:49,924 --> 01:09:51,724
who makes one million dollars a year.

960
01:09:53,523 --> 01:09:57,134
I want to help her succeed, so I can give her to my son.

961
01:09:58,193 --> 01:09:59,204
Give my academy to your son?

962
01:10:02,033 --> 01:10:03,374
Gosh, no.

963
01:10:04,773 --> 01:10:06,443
I meant Ms. Nam.

964
01:10:22,893 --> 01:10:23,893
Get me a different one.

965
01:10:24,393 --> 01:10:26,794
No. You drink way too much coffee.

966
01:10:28,294 --> 01:10:31,433
There are other drinks. Why the medicinal herb tea with jujubes?

967
01:10:32,233 --> 01:10:33,334
It makes me look old.

968
01:10:35,233 --> 01:10:38,174
I want you to live a long life.

969
01:10:40,643 --> 01:10:43,113
You don't look old. You look gorgeous.

970
01:10:43,743 --> 01:10:45,844
Just drink it. If you don't like it, I'll get you a different one.

971
01:10:46,983 --> 01:10:48,084
I won't like it.

972
01:10:58,224 --> 01:11:01,124
You said you experienced a lot of new things because of me.

973
01:11:02,094 --> 01:11:04,634
Was it the day we had our first kiss?

974
01:11:09,804 --> 01:11:11,334
I'll have you try out different food...

975
01:11:11,573 --> 01:11:13,743
and take you to places you haven't been to before.

976
01:11:40,464 --> 01:11:42,504
There's an investor who wants...

977
01:11:42,804 --> 01:11:45,474
to help financially until the academy stabilizes again.

978
01:11:49,073 --> 01:11:50,443
It's Ms. Kim Hyo Im.

979
01:11:51,014 --> 01:11:52,183
That's great.

980
01:11:52,683 --> 01:11:53,914
That's great news.

981
01:11:59,724 --> 01:12:01,893
But why don't you look happy?

982
01:12:02,594 --> 01:12:05,094
Well, the thing is,

983
01:12:05,863 --> 01:12:07,224
Ms. Kim...

984
01:12:08,294 --> 01:12:10,134
wants someone else to be the face of the academy.

985
01:12:11,693 --> 01:12:12,903
She raised concern that...

986
01:12:14,004 --> 01:12:16,474
Hye Jin might not be the best person to be the face of our academy.

987
01:12:19,403 --> 01:12:20,474
I'm sorry.

988
01:12:21,174 --> 01:12:23,773
Gosh. It's very difficult for me to turn down her offer.

989
01:12:25,743 --> 01:12:27,283
So Ms. Nam will be the new face.

990
01:12:31,983 --> 01:12:34,054
Gosh, I'm disappointed in Ms. Kim.

991
01:12:36,023 --> 01:12:37,724
Gosh. She's Seoung Gyu's mom.

992
01:12:37,893 --> 01:12:40,523
I think Mr. Lee Myeong Jun will be really disappointed.

993
01:12:42,164 --> 01:12:44,093
A new leader who made a selfless decision for the academy.

994
01:12:44,094 --> 01:12:45,634
He must have had his hopes up.

995
01:12:47,704 --> 01:12:48,833
What are you talking about?

996
01:12:48,834 --> 01:12:50,933
I won't renew his contract.

997
01:12:57,113 --> 01:12:58,174
Gosh.

998
01:12:59,544 --> 01:13:01,643
So what do you think?

999
01:13:07,924 --> 01:13:08,993
I'm bowing out.

1000
01:13:10,023 --> 01:13:11,094
What?

1001
01:13:11,823 --> 01:13:12,863
I'm done.

1002
01:13:19,403 --> 01:13:22,933
(Daechi Chase)

1003
01:13:41,823 --> 01:13:44,493
By the way, isn't there a fancy term for this?

1004
01:13:44,993 --> 01:13:46,323
Buying a position with money?

1005
01:13:49,233 --> 01:13:50,294
You mean "maegwan maegik?"

1006
01:13:50,764 --> 01:13:53,504
Hey, I'm making an investment.

1007
01:13:55,164 --> 01:13:56,933
Gosh. Why are you laughing?

1008
01:13:57,304 --> 01:13:59,474
Do you really think I bought this position with money?

1009
01:13:59,643 --> 01:14:01,304
No. There were students...

1010
01:14:02,014 --> 01:14:04,544
who asked me what kind of magic "maegwan maegik" was.

1011
01:14:07,783 --> 01:14:09,514
- I see. - I see. "Magic."

1012
01:14:11,584 --> 01:14:14,624
I'll even miss those students who asked these ridiculous questions.

1013
01:14:21,363 --> 01:14:24,733
Gosh. I'm so disappointed that you're leaving.

1014
01:14:26,834 --> 01:14:27,933
Hey.

1015
01:14:28,704 --> 01:14:31,334
- Are you done packing? - Yes, I'm almost done.

1016
01:14:32,844 --> 01:14:35,004
Shouldn't we hire a truck or something?

1017
01:14:35,073 --> 01:14:36,613
You worked in this academy for ten years.

1018
01:14:37,643 --> 01:14:39,183
I kept moving a few things whenever I had a chance.

1019
01:14:41,544 --> 01:14:43,113
Please take good care of Min Ji.

1020
01:14:44,153 --> 01:14:46,322
Gosh. I should ask her to take good care of me.

1021
01:14:46,323 --> 01:14:47,523
She's been here longer than me.

1022
01:14:48,454 --> 01:14:52,224
Mr. Lee pled and begged me for four days to snatch her from me.

1023
01:14:52,393 --> 01:14:53,964
Don't forget that I supported you.

1024
01:14:56,134 --> 01:14:57,164
I'll buy you a drink.

1025
01:14:57,794 --> 01:14:59,004
You're free today, right?

1026
01:14:59,264 --> 01:15:01,063
Well, not today. Let's take a rain check.

1027
01:15:01,433 --> 01:15:03,073
I have an important plan today.

1028
01:15:03,903 --> 01:15:04,903
What?

1029
01:15:06,374 --> 01:15:07,443
The last class.

1030
01:15:20,454 --> 01:15:22,454
(Daechi Chase)

1031
01:15:32,863 --> 01:15:35,733
You must train yourself to articulate your thoughts clearly.

1032
01:15:36,903 --> 01:15:39,403
When you can express your thoughts using precise vocabulary...

1033
01:15:40,174 --> 01:15:42,344
and well-constructed sentences,

1034
01:15:42,544 --> 01:15:44,544
interpreting other people's writing becomes easy.

1035
01:15:45,514 --> 01:15:47,182
If you just focus on mindlessly solving questions...

1036
01:15:47,183 --> 01:15:48,283
from study books without this training,

1037
01:15:48,813 --> 01:15:51,554
it will be the same as leaving your grades up to luck.

1038
01:15:52,653 --> 01:15:55,023
Once in a blue moon, there may be a lucky day...

1039
01:15:55,823 --> 01:15:58,424
when you do really well on the exam because you're in the zone.

1040
01:15:59,323 --> 01:16:00,593
But what would happen...

1041
01:16:00,594 --> 01:16:02,664
if you were to fool yourself into believing that's your true grade?

1042
01:16:04,634 --> 01:16:05,664
Yes.

1043
01:16:06,233 --> 01:16:07,532
You'll cry when you get the results...

1044
01:16:07,533 --> 01:16:09,403
of the college entrance exam and end up on the news.

1045
01:16:11,773 --> 01:16:12,903
Embark on the right path.

1046
01:16:13,943 --> 01:16:16,544
Seek precise vocabulary, sentences, and expressions.

1047
01:16:17,174 --> 01:16:19,384
When you have them, your grades will be unchanging.

1048
01:16:19,943 --> 01:16:23,153
Your studies today will be your asset for the rest of your life.

1049
01:16:24,254 --> 01:16:25,853
- Understood? - Yes.

1050
01:16:26,783 --> 01:16:27,783
Any questions?

1051
01:16:30,523 --> 01:16:32,054
Refer to me as an instructor too.

1052
01:16:34,363 --> 01:16:35,393
Sir.

1053
01:16:37,363 --> 01:16:38,834
Tell us about your first love.

1054
01:16:39,103 --> 01:16:40,164
Gosh.

1055
01:16:41,704 --> 01:16:43,134
- Hey, Seo Hye Jin. - Yes.

1056
01:16:43,273 --> 01:16:46,103
Sometimes, you use an advanced technique on me.

1057
01:16:48,174 --> 01:16:50,643
Sir. Are you married?

1058
01:16:52,643 --> 01:16:53,643
Not yet.

1059
01:16:54,384 --> 01:16:56,483
I already proposed to her. I'm begging her to take me.

1060
01:16:57,283 --> 01:16:58,313
Sir.

1061
01:16:58,813 --> 01:17:00,823
- Good luck. - Come on.

1062
01:17:02,153 --> 01:17:03,624
Since we're on the subject, let me ask you this.

1063
01:17:04,323 --> 01:17:05,964
- Since you're a girl. Yes. - I am?

1064
01:17:08,464 --> 01:17:10,233
- An apartment in Gangnam... - Okay.

1065
01:17:10,563 --> 01:17:12,704
Do I need stuff like that to get her to say yes?

1066
01:17:12,933 --> 01:17:14,033
Probably not.

1067
01:17:14,164 --> 01:17:16,133
Then should I float up balloons at a hotel...

1068
01:17:16,134 --> 01:17:17,334
and prepare an expensive designer bag?

1069
01:17:17,733 --> 01:17:19,374
Should I throw her an event like that?

1070
01:17:20,974 --> 01:17:22,174
Probably not.

1071
01:17:59,584 --> 01:18:00,613
Then how about this?

1072
01:18:01,914 --> 01:18:03,613
I bought it a while ago. I've been carrying for a while.

1073
01:18:04,683 --> 01:18:05,954
My girlfriend...

1074
01:18:06,054 --> 01:18:08,424
might start going to school where there are a lot of guys.

1075
01:18:09,124 --> 01:18:10,293
"She's taken."

1076
01:18:10,294 --> 01:18:11,823
I need to let them know she's off the market. You know?

1077
01:18:13,393 --> 01:18:14,523
Will she like it?

1078
01:18:23,273 --> 01:18:24,834
Could you answer me?

1079
01:18:26,844 --> 01:18:28,443
I'm really nervous right now.

1080
01:18:30,214 --> 01:18:31,273
Will she like it?

1081
01:19:01,044 --> 01:19:02,174
How beautiful.

1082
01:19:05,683 --> 01:19:06,813
It looks good on you.

1083
01:19:15,523 --> 01:19:17,294
Do you think I'll be able to get married?

1084
01:19:19,094 --> 01:19:20,094
Maybe.

1085
01:19:23,863 --> 01:19:26,634
Are you still curious about my first love?

1086
01:19:27,403 --> 01:19:28,464
No.

1087
01:19:30,474 --> 01:19:31,804
If you don't have any more questions,

1088
01:19:33,004 --> 01:19:34,143
can I end the class?

1089
01:19:35,573 --> 01:19:36,613
