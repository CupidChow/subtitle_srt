00:00:58,130 --> 00:01:00,630
Are you a college student? A part-timer?

15
00:01:00,630 --> 00:01:02,380
Yes.

16
00:01:02,380 --> 00:01:03,830
Starting today, we'll-

17
00:01:03,830 --> 00:01:05,860
What year are you in?

18
00:01:05,860 --> 00:01:07,750
I'm a junior.

19
00:01:09,190 --> 00:01:11,350
Can I call you "Nuna"?

20
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:16,660
You mastered Hangul, right?

21
00:01:17,940 --> 00:01:20,400
- Pardon?
 - You can be honest.

22
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:22,480
You don't have to be ashamed.

23
00:01:26,380 --> 00:01:28,460
Ridiculous.

24
00:01:28,460 --> 00:01:32,140
Not as much as your parents who saw your report card.

25
00:01:33,410 --> 00:01:35,490
Knowing the letters doesn't mean you can read.

26
00:01:35,490 --> 00:01:38,550
Open the book. You'll practice reading starting today.

27
00:01:38,550 --> 00:01:42,680
And call me "Teacher."

28
00:01:44,750 --> 00:01:45,970
 Teacher. 

29
00:01:45,970 --> 00:01:47,490
 What? 

30
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:50,310
 Try calling me that. 

31
00:01:51,090 --> 00:01:52,460
 What? 

32
00:01:52,460 --> 00:01:55,130
 Try calling me "Teacher." 

33
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:58,530
 I think that'd make me so happy. 

34
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:06,020
No way.

 Episode 2 

36
00:02:20,610 --> 00:02:22,590
- Hello.
 - Hello.

37
00:02:22,590 --> 00:02:25,490
Hello.

38
00:02:25,490 --> 00:02:29,430
Text the ones who passed the exam about the demo lecture.

39
00:02:29,430 --> 00:02:30,970
Okay.

40
00:02:31,930 --> 00:02:33,780
Hello.

41
00:02:35,460 --> 00:02:38,440
Team Leader, you came in early.

42
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:40,100
What's this?

43
00:02:40,100 --> 00:02:42,180
Since you're working so hard.

44
00:02:42,180 --> 00:02:44,300
Thank you.

45
00:02:44,300 --> 00:02:46,390
Can I check an applicant's resume by chance?

46
00:02:46,390 --> 00:02:48,200
Of course. What's the name?

47
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:50,000
Lee Jun Ho.

48
00:02:51,060 --> 00:02:52,760
 Applicants from the first round 

49
00:02:52,760 --> 00:02:54,290
 Korean 

50
00:02:54,290 --> 00:02:56,250
 Korean, Lee Jun Ho 

51
00:02:56,250 --> 00:02:58,040
 Resume 

52
00:02:59,250 --> 00:03:01,150
This is him, right? The one from the Hall of Fame.

53
00:03:01,150 --> 00:03:02,810
Yes.

54
00:03:04,210 --> 00:03:05,360
 Resume 

55
00:03:10,980 --> 00:03:13,120
He's handsome.

56
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:18,300
Here you go.

57
00:03:18,300 --> 00:03:20,070
Thank you.

58
00:03:23,250 --> 00:03:25,070
- Hello.
 - Hi.

59
00:03:32,070 --> 00:03:34,250
What's this?

60
00:03:34,250 --> 00:03:37,310
She wanted to check someone's resume.

61
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:40,860
Seo Hye Jin cares about an applicant?

62
00:03:40,860 --> 00:03:42,320
A special treatment or something?

63
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:46,140
No. It's Lee Jun Ho, who used to be a student here.

64
00:03:47,270 --> 00:03:48,770
Who?

65
00:03:48,770 --> 00:03:50,160
Lee Jun Ho.

66
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:54,130
His name is in the lobby here.

67
00:03:54,130 --> 00:03:57,170
The resume. Let me see his resume, too.

68
00:03:57,170 --> 00:04:00,750
What? Why would you?

69
00:04:00,750 --> 00:04:02,690
I'll just see the photo. Just the photo.

70
00:04:02,690 --> 00:04:05,070
- Hurry.
 - Just the photo?

71
00:04:06,870 --> 00:04:08,350
Gosh.

72
00:04:19,890 --> 00:04:21,850
- I'm not late, am I?
 - No.

73
00:04:21,850 --> 00:04:24,160
I'm sorry you came early because of me.

74
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:27,570
I'm always happy to have a one-on-one.

75
00:04:27,570 --> 00:04:30,370
That's mine, right? Thank you.

76
00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:36,650
What's going on that made you want to see me outside?

77
00:04:36,650 --> 00:04:41,010
I imagined all sorts of things on the way, wondering if you're switching jobs.

78
00:04:41,010 --> 00:04:43,790
Team Leader, do you remember Jun Ho?

79
00:04:43,790 --> 00:04:45,970
Jun Ho? Which Jun Ho?

80
00:04:45,970 --> 00:04:48,140
Lee Jun Ho. When I worked part-time.

81
00:04:48,140 --> 00:04:51,090
Oh, when we were upstairs from the hair salon?

82
00:04:51,090 --> 00:04:53,110
I remember. I taught him English.

83
00:04:53,110 --> 00:04:54,300
What about him?

84
00:04:54,300 --> 00:04:56,810
He came to the academy yesterday.

85
00:04:56,810 --> 00:05:00,850
Really? Doesn't he usually come on Teacher's Days?

86
00:05:00,850 --> 00:05:02,980
To take the exam.

87
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:05,730
Sorry.

88
00:05:08,230 --> 00:05:10,250
- Take what?
 - The exam.

89
00:05:10,250 --> 00:05:12,390
The lecturer recruitment exam.

90
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:32,190
Look at this guy. He's serious.

91
00:05:32,190 --> 00:05:34,790
It looks like he did well on the written exam, too.

92
00:05:34,790 --> 00:05:37,080
I think he'll do the demo lecture, too.

93
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:38,630
Okay, so?

94
00:05:39,350 --> 00:05:42,850
I want you to reject him.

95
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:52,830
Why do I have to?

96
00:05:52,830 --> 00:05:57,170
He's acting arrogant, saying he can do it and looks down on it.

97
00:05:57,900 --> 00:05:59,400
I thought you wanted everything to be fair.

98
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:01,540
This sounds like a very unjust soliciting.

99
00:06:01,540 --> 00:06:04,870
Don't you regret quitting your corporate job?

100
00:06:06,250 --> 00:06:10,320
I can't just let my old student act childishly.

101
00:06:12,070 --> 00:06:14,350
But not hiring him won't do anything.

102
00:06:14,350 --> 00:06:17,420
He could easily work for other academies with his resume.

103
00:06:17,420 --> 00:06:20,770
I want to buy time and persuade him.

104
00:06:20,770 --> 00:06:22,470
Help me.

105
00:06:23,970 --> 00:06:25,460
Okay.

106
00:06:25,460 --> 00:06:27,690
I understand your intention.

107
00:06:27,690 --> 00:06:30,240
Even if he seems to have potential—

108
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:34,160
You're the one who said even the experienced ones get nervous during the demo.

109
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:37,190
He doesn't even have any experience. How good could he be?

110
00:06:44,730 --> 00:06:45,870
 I passed the written exam. 

111
00:06:45,870 --> 00:06:50,900
 I'm sure you aren't interested, but it's my habit to report the results to you. 

112
00:06:50,900 --> 00:06:53,660
I don't think he'd agree with you.

113
00:06:59,670 --> 00:07:01,710
- Hey.
 - You came.

114
00:07:01,710 --> 00:07:04,610
What were you looking at? Come in.

115
00:07:05,220 --> 00:07:07,310
You need the large lecture room, right?

116
00:07:07,310 --> 00:07:09,420
You should've called the administrative office.

117
00:07:09,420 --> 00:07:11,330
I just need the smallest lecture room.

118
00:07:11,330 --> 00:07:14,020
It's not official business. It's personal.

119
00:07:14,020 --> 00:07:15,420
What?

120
00:07:16,220 --> 00:07:18,770
Why do you need the lecture room personally?

121
00:07:18,770 --> 00:07:20,000
You don't have to know.

122
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:23,500
So, you'll practice an academy lecture here?

123
00:07:23,500 --> 00:07:26,390
Yes. How long can I use this room for?

124
00:07:26,390 --> 00:07:28,390
Wow.

125
00:07:29,650 --> 00:07:33,030
Please keep it a secret for now. I'll tell my parents myself.

126
00:07:35,540 --> 00:07:40,240
This can't be the gold mine you were talking about, right?

127
00:07:41,610 --> 00:07:44,480
- Lee Jun Ho.
 - I don't have time. Get out. Get out.

128
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:46,850
Hey, it's not even a major academy. You—

129
00:07:46,850 --> 00:07:48,510
I need job experience

130
00:07:48,510 --> 00:07:51,550
so I can get high pay.

131
00:07:55,750 --> 00:07:58,190
Hey, do you want to film me?

132
00:07:58,190 --> 00:08:00,430
I'll let you attend my lecture, then.

133
00:08:00,430 --> 00:08:02,450
- Are you crazy?
 - Hurry up and start filming.

134
00:08:02,450 --> 00:08:05,410
Forget it. I know nothing about this.

135
00:08:06,100 --> 00:08:07,700
Seriously.

136
00:08:25,760 --> 00:08:30,100
 There are fifteen Korean, ten English, and three social studies applicants for the demo. 

137
00:08:30,100 --> 00:08:32,980
They all got perfect scores on the exam.

138
00:08:32,980 --> 00:08:36,350
The exam was just a formality.

139
00:08:36,350 --> 00:08:39,220
 Resume  
 We're actually getting started now.

140
00:08:39,220 --> 00:08:40,870
Huh?

141
00:08:43,550 --> 00:08:45,950
What is it?

142
00:08:45,950 --> 00:08:49,240
Was Jun Ho really here?

143
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:50,700
Pardon?

144
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:53,060
I suppose you don't know him.

145
00:08:53,060 --> 00:08:55,360
Before our academies merged,

146
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:59,920
there was Lee Jun Ho at Daechi Chase.

147
00:09:00,850 --> 00:09:03,670
 Kim Yoo Jeong, "Spring, Spring" 

148
00:09:17,590 --> 00:09:21,780
You'll study Kim Yoo Jeong's "Spring, Spring" today.

149
00:09:21,780 --> 00:09:24,660
You need to know about the characters first.

150
00:09:24,660 --> 00:09:27,760
There's "I," the protagonist and narrator of the piece.

151
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:30,940
And there's the father-in-law who's in conflict with "I."

152
00:09:30,940 --> 00:09:32,900
 The father-in-law is Jeom Sun's father 

153
00:09:32,900 --> 00:09:35,530
 and a very cunning supervisor of the neighborhood farm. 

154
00:09:35,530 --> 00:09:40,610
 And "I" is being exploited by the father-in-law under the condition he can marry Jeom Sun. 

155
00:09:40,610 --> 00:09:45,270
 He's a very naive and foolish son-in-law who lives with his in-laws. 

156
00:09:45,270 --> 00:09:46,620
 Between these two characters... 

157
00:09:46,620 --> 00:09:47,950
♫  What's it gonna be?  ♫

158
00:09:47,950 --> 00:09:50,990
♫  If you're gonna forget me  ♫

159
00:09:50,990 --> 00:09:53,760
♫  Then you gotta set me free  ♫

160
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:55,700
♫  You think you'll always regret me  ♫

161
00:09:55,700 --> 00:10:00,120
♫  Can you catch me?  ♫

162
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:20,690
 Lee Jun Ho 

163
00:10:20,690 --> 00:10:23,560
♫  Chase me down the hall  ♫

164
00:10:23,560 --> 00:10:25,690
♫  Then never answering my call  ♫

165

How about the length?

172
00:10:46,740 --> 00:10:50,100
- We can accentuate it and keep it natural.
 - Do I need to curl it?

173
00:10:50,100 --> 00:10:52,020
Just the front part?

The protagonist's naivété doesn't let him see the paradoxical situation.

176
00:11:00,630 --> 00:11:05,110
That's the key feature of the novel's humorous quality.

177
00:11:05,910 --> 00:11:09,370
With the non-linear structure in which the past and present alternate,

178
00:11:09,370 --> 00:11:14,800
we're able to experience the piece from different angles.

Sir, that's for the lecture room downstairs. Go down the stairs.

What was I going to do?

00:13:05,910 --> 00:13:08,930
You said you'd give me the commentary sheet for today's lecture.

200
00:13:08,930 --> 00:13:10,670
Right.

201
00:13:13,310 --> 00:13:15,380
You're acting kind of strange today.

202
00:13:15,380 --> 00:13:17,800
Sorry. I'll send it right now.

I'm not looking for anyone.

Hello.

00:14:20,150 --> 00:14:24,310
Whoa, I knew you'd be here.

211
00:14:24,310 --> 00:14:27,000
I had a feeling I'd see you, too.

212
00:14:27,990 --> 00:14:29,650
What did you prepare?

213
00:14:29,650 --> 00:14:32,660
I prepared classical literature for 10th-graders above Level 2.

214
00:14:32,660 --> 00:14:35,270
I prepared modern literature for the students below Level 5.

215
00:14:35,270 --> 00:14:37,140
Below Level 5?

216
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:40,470
I suppose.

217
00:14:40,470 --> 00:14:44,870
If you're below Level 5 here, would you be above average in other neighborhoods?

218
00:14:45,650 --> 00:14:49,220
Some of them are not.

219
00:14:49,220 --> 00:14:52,320
You must be experienced in this.

220
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:56,050
Well, you could say that.

221
00:14:57,940 --> 00:15:00,290
- Fighting.
 - Yes.

State your name, subject, and start.

234
00:16:10,330 --> 00:16:11,730
Okay.

235
00:16:17,500 --> 00:16:20,480
I'm Nam Cheong Mi, an applicant for the Korean department.

236
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:22,590
You can start.

237
00:16:22,590 --> 00:16:24,560
Okay.

238
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:27,300
The lecture I prepared today is...

239
00:16:28,940 --> 00:16:35,310
classical literature for 10th-graders above Level 2.

240
00:16:36,900 --> 00:16:42,940
It's on "Song of Blue Mountains."

241
00:16:42,940 --> 00:16:45,270
I'll get started now.

242
00:16:47,100 --> 00:16:49,070
Okay.

243
00:16:49,070 --> 00:16:54,300
Classical literature. It's so freaking hard.

244
00:16:54,300 --> 00:16:59,660
This was the most annoying part when I was in high school, too.

245
00:16:59,660 --> 00:17:04,080
It's not even a pop song, but a Goryeo-era song? Why the heck should we study that?

246
00:17:04,080 --> 00:17:07,040
Huh? Don't you agree?

247
00:17:08,990 --> 00:17:11,350
Do you agree or not?

248
00:17:11,350 --> 00:17:12,550
I agree.

249
00:17:12,550 --> 00:17:13,930
Thank you.

250
00:17:13,930 --> 00:17:18,810
I totally understand how you guys feel.

251
00:17:18,810 --> 00:17:21,020
It's too warm. Hold on.

252
00:17:21,020 --> 00:17:25,310
I completely understand how you feel that...

253
00:17:29,900 --> 00:17:32,400
I dressed like this.

254
00:17:33,690 --> 00:17:35,910
But...

255
00:17:36,840 --> 00:17:38,350
what can you do?

256
00:17:38,350 --> 00:17:44,830
Both teachers and testing institutes love this piece so much.

257
00:17:44,830 --> 00:17:50,000
We have no choice. Pretend like your friend is talking to you.

258
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,820
"Song of Blue Mountains."

259
00:17:51,820 --> 00:17:55,670
There are basic things you need to memorize.

260
00:17:55,670 --> 00:17:57,770
The genre is Goryeo-era song.

261
00:17:57,770 --> 00:18:00,640
The characteristics are escape from reality and melancholic.

262
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:04,270
The rhythmic structure is 3-3-2 with two meters.

263
00:18:12,180 --> 00:18:13,710
What are you up to?

264
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:19,020
I was looking at the after-school class list.

265
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:22,790
It looks like it might get canceled.

266
00:18:22,790 --> 00:18:26,130
Probably. They need to go to academies.

267
00:18:26,130 --> 00:18:30,010
We got the Seogang University essay test commentary sheet. Check your email.

268
00:18:30,010 --> 00:18:31,490
Okay.

269
00:18:32,600 --> 00:18:34,710
 Especially the affricate and fricative sounds 

270
00:18:34,710 --> 00:18:36,880
have a very strong and sharp sound.

271
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:40,240
Look. Seu. Sseu. Jeu. Jjeu.

272
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:42,380
What do these have in common?

273
00:18:42,380 --> 00:18:44,420
They're curse words. Curse words.

274
00:18:44,420 --> 00:18:48,080
Our country has a lot of curse words starting with these sounds.

275
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:50,750
You don't need me to explain, right?  

276
00:18:50,750 --> 00:18:52,260
Let me emphasize this again.

277
00:18:52,260 --> 00:18:55,840
Humans have a very intricate oral structure.

278
00:18:55,840 --> 00:18:58,610
If you understand a few sound groups,

279
00:18:58,610 --> 00:19:02,850
you'll understand this chart automatically.

280
00:19:09,550 --> 00:19:12,590
Looks like the English department starts late.

281
00:19:12,590 --> 00:19:15,440
Yes, we still have time to kill.

282
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:17,830
I'm leaving since I just finished.

283
00:19:17,830 --> 00:19:20,300
This is fate, too. I hope you do well.

284
00:19:20,300 --> 00:19:23,150
Well, thank you.

285
00:19:23,150 --> 00:19:26,560
- Oh, well, then... 
 - Oh, okay.

00:20:12,910 --> 00:20:14,430
Okay.

290
00:20:14,430 --> 00:20:16,970
Don't get nervous. Do it at your own pace.

291
00:20:16,970 --> 00:20:19,070
I'm not nervous.

292
00:20:19,070 --> 00:20:21,840
Great. Shall we start?

293
00:20:49,260 --> 00:20:50,830
You. Get out.

294
00:20:52,370 --> 00:20:54,270
You won't listen. I'll give you a refund.

295
00:20:54,270 --> 00:20:56,230
Hey, Lee Jun Ho.

296
00:20:59,920 --> 00:21:02,140
You're just sitting here...

297
00:21:02,140 --> 00:21:05,180
and your parents feel assured while you're doing that.

298
00:21:05,180 --> 00:21:07,260
And I get paid for it.

299
00:21:07,260 --> 00:21:09,410
You think that's fine, right?

300
00:21:09,410 --> 00:21:10,710
But I hate to break it to you.

301
00:21:10,710 --> 00:21:14,000
I'm not interested in killing time that way.

302
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:18,010
Give your spot to someone else and leave if you won't listen.

303
00:21:18,010 --> 00:21:21,730
You're wasting your parents' money, labor, and expectations.

304
00:21:21,730 --> 00:21:24,540
Saving them the trouble would be your filial duty.

305
00:21:25,830 --> 00:21:28,150
You were given 10 minutes.

306
00:21:28,150 --> 00:21:30,000
Mr. Lee Jun Ho.

307
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:33,570
We're running out of time. Can we see your lecture?

308
00:21:40,290 --> 00:21:45,400
All of you sitting here are in the bottom tier,

309
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:47,710
to be honest.

310
00:21:47,710 --> 00:21:50,070
You make it sound cool by calling it "no base" or whatever.

311
00:21:50,070 --> 00:21:53,120
But you're just bad at studying.

312
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:56,140
You might sometimes think this:

313
00:21:56,140 --> 00:22:00,730
"Gosh, what if my life is screwed?"

314
00:22:00,730 --> 00:22:03,130
How do I know?

315
00:22:03,130 --> 00:22:05,130
I was there, too.

316
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:07,390
Let me tell you in advance.

317
00:22:07,390 --> 00:22:12,020
I was in second place for my first mock test in high school.

318
00:22:12,020 --> 00:22:13,720
Second from the bottom.

319
00:22:14,860 --> 00:22:18,580
But I've never even seen the first one from the bottom

320
00:22:18,580 --> 00:22:21,690
because I never even came to school.

321
00:22:23,580 --> 00:22:29,390
That's why I understand your fear so well.

322
00:22:29,390 --> 00:22:34,480
Your peers are probably running ahead at an intimidating pace.

323
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:38,190
Some bastard is reading Hegel. Hegel.

324
00:22:38,190 --> 00:22:43,880
I deeply understand the hopeless feeling and fear that you encounter in those moments.

325
00:22:43,880 --> 00:22:46,510
But you study for three years for the entrance exam.

326
00:22:46,510 --> 00:22:48,650
It's a way longer race than you think.

327
00:22:48,650 --> 00:22:52,590
It's not too late to start now. You can easily catch up.

328
00:22:52,590 --> 00:22:55,920
You just don't know how to study.

329
00:22:55,920 --> 00:22:57,650
Don't get scared.

330
00:22:57,650 --> 00:22:59,510
I'll run with you.

331
00:23:00,410 --> 00:23:04,890
Okay. Today, you guys will be

332
00:23:05,570 --> 00:23:07,980
studying Kim Yu Jeong's...

333
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:11,780
"Spring, Spring."

334
00:23:13,820 --> 00:23:16,070
By the way,

335
00:23:17,370 --> 00:23:20,340
you'll hit a wall from the first line of the textbook.

336
00:23:20,340 --> 00:23:24,860
"It's a satirical novel that takes place in a farming village in the 1930s.

337
00:23:24,860 --> 00:23:27,010
Focus on the characters' characteristics and the narrative structure

338
00:23:27,010 --> 00:23:29,490
while appreciating the piece."

339
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:33,990
The first line is already so intimidating.

340
00:23:33,990 --> 00:23:35,630
Okay.

341
00:23:36,330 --> 00:23:37,500
What's "appreciating"?

342
00:23:37,500 --> 00:23:43,640
The dictionary says it means enjoying, understanding, and assessing a piece of art.

343
00:23:43,640 --> 00:23:46,220
By the way, can you enjoy this? Huh?

344
00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:51,340
You can. How?

345
00:23:51,340 --> 00:23:53,380
You need to know how to read it.

346
00:23:54,440 --> 00:23:56,650
You know...

347
00:23:57,450 --> 00:23:59,920
I have a teacher I admire.

348
00:23:59,920 --> 00:24:02,580
The day I met her...

349
00:24:03,190 --> 00:24:05,860
was probably the highlight of my life.

350
00:24:08,520 --> 00:24:10,890
There was only one thing she asked of me.

351
00:24:10,890 --> 00:24:13,600
It's because you don't know how to read.

352
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:18,390
Let's each read one paragraph and go home.

353
00:24:18,390 --> 00:24:22,170
If you read it over and over again, eventually you'll be able to read.

354
00:24:22,170 --> 00:24:26,850
Each word and line will open up a new world for you.

355
00:24:26,850 --> 00:24:29,000
That's the beauty of Korean literature.

356
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:33,200
You get to think when you can read, and when you think, you get curious.

357
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:35,630
When you get curious,

358
00:24:35,630 --> 00:24:39,500
you'll end up studying on your own.

359
00:24:40,910 --> 00:24:44,440
Starting today, you and I will start that training.

360
00:24:44,440 --> 00:24:49,330
I won't let you overlook a sentence or a line.

361
00:24:49,330 --> 00:24:54,620
Literature, reading, and even grammar are based on that.

362
00:25:01,210 --> 00:25:03,380
 He's doing well. 

363
00:25:10,600 --> 00:25:13,400
- Oh? 
 - Huh?

364
00:25:13,400 --> 00:25:16,270
Huh? Seung Gyu, what are you doing here at this hour?

365
00:25:16,270 --> 00:25:18,710
Why is the chief home at this hour, then?

366
00:25:18,710 --> 00:25:21,440
I have no consultations since there's an event today.

367
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:23,530
I need to go in later. How about you?

368
00:25:23,530 --> 00:25:25,590
- Event?
 - Yes.

369
00:25:26,350 --> 00:25:32,670
I came back because the professor and students went on a field trip.

370
00:25:32,670 --> 00:25:34,560
I'll take a nap.

371
00:25:41,010 --> 00:25:42,630
I said I'll take a nap.

372
00:25:42,630 --> 00:25:44,690
Have a seat here.

373
00:25:45,680 --> 00:25:48,180
Gosh, I'm tired.

374
00:25:48,180 --> 00:25:51,630
Did you hear anything from Jun Ho?

375
00:25:53,300 --> 00:25:54,680
Huh?

376
00:25:55,640 --> 00:25:58,030
What was I supposed to hear from him?

377
00:25:58,700 --> 00:26:00,740
You know something.

378
00:26:01,400 --> 00:26:03,800
I didn't hear the details.

379
00:26:05,580 --> 00:26:08,820
Gosh, his mom would be in such shock.

380
00:26:08,820 --> 00:26:11,450
There are better things to be in shock for.

381
00:26:12,460 --> 00:26:16,030
It's risky, but it's worth giving a try.

382
00:26:16,030 --> 00:26:19,650
He gave his parents a hard time, unlike his older brother.

383
00:26:19,650 --> 00:26:22,260
They spent a fortune on him, too.

384
00:26:23,930 --> 00:26:26,790
Aigoo, what's the point of sending him to a good school?

385
00:26:26,790 --> 00:26:30,520
Everyone at that academy went to a good school.

386
00:26:30,520 --> 00:26:33,680
I can't do it with my credentials, even if I want to.

387
00:26:33,680 --> 00:26:35,960
Why would you say that?

388
00:26:35,960 --> 00:26:40,650
I know you resent the fact that I was never able to beat Jun Ho.

389
00:26:40,650 --> 00:26:43,010
But don't even think that

390
00:26:43,010 --> 00:26:45,630
you beat his mom with this.

391
00:26:47,550 --> 00:26:49,700
I don't know why,

392
00:26:49,700 --> 00:26:53,820
but you sound crueler and crueler.

393
00:26:53,820 --> 00:26:56,570
When a boy sins, he goes to a juvie,

394
00:26:56,570 --> 00:27:00,030
and when a college student sins, he goes to grad school, they say.

395
00:27:02,150 --> 00:27:04,970
Maybe they teach bad things in grad school.

396
00:27:11,220 --> 00:27:13,330
There's no way...

397
00:27:14,250 --> 00:27:16,510
he'd pass, anyway.

398
00:27:18,050 --> 00:27:23,480
Lee Jun Ho is the last one in the Korean department.

399
00:27:24,080 --> 00:27:26,930
He practiced a lot. He chose a good target, too.

400
00:27:26,930 --> 00:27:31,950
They rarely talk to a judge.

401
00:27:31,950 --> 00:27:34,290
That really was...

402
00:27:34,290 --> 00:27:38,930
I know it was a performance, but he was gutsy.

403
00:27:38,930 --> 00:27:42,180
Sociability, penmanship, and delivery.

404
00:27:42,180 --> 00:27:44,300
I thought he was good overall.

405
00:27:44,300 --> 00:27:47,430
He must've been short on time, but he learned quickly.

406
00:27:47,430 --> 00:27:51,120
If you consider the potential regardless of experience,

407
00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:54,350
I think he meets the requirements of this event.

408
00:27:54,350 --> 00:27:58,450
This line of work requires talent, too.

409
00:27:58,450 --> 00:28:01,900
I'm not sure if he'd help the academy's strategy.

410
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:07,460
We don't have many lower-grade students here.

411
00:28:07,460 --> 00:28:10,330
You don't have to worry about that.

412
00:28:10,330 --> 00:28:14,160
Didn't Team Leader Ji Seok teach him English?

413
00:28:14,160 --> 00:28:17,590
Yes, I did.

414
00:28:17,590 --> 00:28:21,070
Wow, he went from Level 8 to Level 1?

415
00:28:21,070 --> 00:28:23,620
He experienced the top, middle, and bottom.

416
00:28:23,620 --> 00:28:27,080
You could call him an all-round player.

417
00:28:29,620 --> 00:28:32,100
What did you think, Team Leader Seo?

418
00:28:34,090 --> 00:28:38,740
The curriculum has changed twice since he graduated.

419
00:28:38,740 --> 00:28:43,680
It seems irrelevant that he went up in level back in the day.

420
00:28:45,930 --> 00:28:49,040
He used his social skills to mask the lack of lecture content.

421
00:28:49,040 --> 00:28:54,040
Most importantly, I think he won't last long as a lecturer.

422
00:28:55,800 --> 00:28:57,990
What do you mean he won't last long?

423
00:28:57,990 --> 00:29:00,590
To train a new lecturer,

424
00:29:00,590 --> 00:29:04,250
the academy needs to spend a lot of time and effort on them.

425
00:29:04,250 --> 00:29:08,340
The academy will invest in them until they become a proper lecturer.

426
00:29:08,340 --> 00:29:13,750
Of course, it'd be great if they became our asset afterward,

427
00:29:13,750 --> 00:29:20,760
but I'm not sure if he'd become helpful to the Korean department.

428
00:29:21,540 --> 00:29:23,860
Do you think he'll dine and dash?

429
00:29:23,860 --> 00:29:28,060
He quit his job after working less than three years.

430
00:29:28,060 --> 00:29:32,620
But it'd be the academy's loss, not yours.

431
00:29:32,620 --> 00:29:34,740
Is it okay if I don't train him?

432
00:29:34,740 --> 00:29:36,560
Will you train him, Team Leader Lee?

433
00:29:36,560 --> 00:29:38,780
No, my team won't have time.

434
00:29:38,780 --> 00:29:43,160
I'm already busy with lectures, counselling, and student management.

435
00:29:43,160 --> 00:29:45,480
There are other talented lecturers.

436
00:29:45,480 --> 00:29:49,610
I don't want to waste energy by hiring an unstable newcomer.

437
00:29:56,700 --> 00:29:58,150
I suppose so.

438
00:29:58,150 --> 00:30:01,560
The future superior's opinion would matter the most.

439
00:30:01,560 --> 00:30:03,960
Thank you.

440
00:30:03,960 --> 00:30:07,510
If so, I'll give Team Leader Hye Jin more time.

441
00:30:07,510 --> 00:30:09,810
No, I—

442
00:30:09,810 --> 00:30:17,450
The director makes the final decision in hiring at other academies, right?

443
00:30:17,450 --> 00:30:20,930
- Yes.
 - But I listen to your opinions,

444
00:30:20,930 --> 00:30:23,880
and I democratically collect votes.

445
00:30:26,200 --> 00:30:29,690
Let's all give it some thought.

446
00:30:29,690 --> 00:30:31,530
Got it.

447
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:35,210
 The nation is facing a population aging crisis. 

448
00:30:35,210 --> 00:30:40,580
 As I just said, not just the elderly population, but the aging rate of 

449
00:30:40,580 --> 00:30:44,310
 people in 30s and 40s needs attention, too. 

450
00:30:45,850 --> 00:30:48,320
Honey, my back.

451
00:30:49,180 --> 00:30:51,200
What about your back?

452
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:53,580
I want you to hit it.

453
00:30:53,580 --> 00:30:55,770
I must have indigestion.

454
00:30:56,420 --> 00:31:00,560
Geez, it's because you eat and do nothing.

455
00:31:00,560 --> 00:31:02,270
What do you mean I do nothing?

456
00:31:02,270 --> 00:31:04,730
I made Yong Ho side dishes and delivered them today.

457
00:31:04,730 --> 00:31:06,990
Try doing something productive.

458
00:31:06,990 --> 00:31:08,890
Learn something, perhaps.

459
00:31:08,890 --> 00:31:13,290
What's more productive than what I did?

460
00:31:13,290 --> 00:31:16,080
Did you eat something funny? Why are you yelling?

461
00:31:16,080 --> 00:31:17,770
Gosh, seriously.

462
00:31:17,770 --> 00:31:19,350
Geez...

463
00:31:28,160 --> 00:31:30,780
- I'm home.
 - Hey, welcome home.

464
00:31:30,780 --> 00:31:32,260
Did you have dinner?

465
00:31:32,260 --> 00:31:34,220
- Yes, I did.
 - Go take a shower, then.

466
00:31:34,220 --> 00:31:36,230
- Okay.
 - Would you like some fruit?

467
00:31:36,230 --> 00:31:38,490
No, that's okay.

468
00:31:39,810 --> 00:31:41,850
I have something to say.

469
00:31:52,490 --> 00:31:55,410
What? What is it?

470
00:31:56,730 --> 00:32:00,960
You'll be a bit shocked. Please listen first.

471
00:32:02,470 --> 00:32:04,340
Go ahead.

472
00:32:08,330 --> 00:32:10,740
I submitted a resignation letter.

473
00:32:10,740 --> 00:32:12,470
And it was accepted.

474
00:32:17,250 --> 00:32:20,370
Please respect my decision.

475
00:32:20,370 --> 00:32:21,990
- What?
 - What?

476
00:32:23,760 --> 00:32:26,820
But for what reason?

477
00:32:26,820 --> 00:32:31,880
You did that without discussing it with us at all?

478
00:32:31,880 --> 00:32:36,050
You would've objected to it, but I would've done it anyway.

479
00:32:36,050 --> 00:32:37,860
I skipped the unnecessary step.

480
00:32:37,860 --> 00:32:40,080
I'm asking you why.

481
00:32:40,910 --> 00:32:42,640
Hurry up and tell us.

482
00:32:42,640 --> 00:32:45,770
Do you want me to die from frustration?

483
00:32:50,670 --> 00:32:53,280
I'm thinking of teaching at an academy.

484
00:32:53,280 --> 00:32:55,270
I took the exam today.

485
00:32:57,250 --> 00:32:58,740
I did well.

486
00:32:58,740 --> 00:33:01,610
I'll keep applying if I don't get the job.

487
00:33:03,350 --> 00:33:04,720
You want to do what?

488
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:08,180
I can be the best in the country in three years.

489
00:33:08,180 --> 00:33:11,080
- Then my salary would be— 
- Are you out of your mind?

490
00:33:11,080 --> 00:33:12,760
Yes.

491
00:33:12,760 --> 00:33:16,230
That's a cut below your old job.

492
00:33:16,230 --> 00:33:18,600
It's not. Things changed a long time ago, Dad.

493
00:33:18,600 --> 00:33:19,970
Do you think the company is a joke?

494
00:33:19,970 --> 00:33:22,440
I was more diligent and serious than anyone.

495
00:33:22,440 --> 00:33:25,180
- A corporate job is not as valuable to me. 
 - You didn't even work there that long.

496
00:33:25,180 --> 00:33:28,890
I did this because I didn't know if I'd last that long.

497
00:33:32,350 --> 00:33:33,950
Social status?

498
00:33:33,950 --> 00:33:36,550
Yes, I know you're worried about that.

499
00:33:36,550 --> 00:33:40,140
- I can prove it with my pay and where I live—
- That's enough!

500
00:33:41,480 --> 00:33:44,320
How dare you say something so low class?

501
00:33:48,840 --> 00:33:52,070
You were born in a better era.

502
00:33:52,070 --> 00:33:55,500
Thanks to that, we've been living in Daechi-dong,

503
00:33:55,500 --> 00:33:59,440
but Hyung, me, and  Eun Ho would get pushed out into the countryside

504
00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:01,310
if we just had office jobs.

505
00:34:01,310 --> 00:34:03,430
I really don't want to do that.

506
00:34:04,440 --> 00:34:06,330
I can become successful faster than anyone.

507
00:34:06,330 --> 00:34:10,360
Just think I'm becoming a celebrity or something.

508
00:34:11,860 --> 00:34:14,100
You're too young now.

509
00:34:16,780 --> 00:34:18,870
Work at the company a bit longer

510
00:34:18,870 --> 00:34:21,100
and if you still want to, try later.

511
00:34:21,100 --> 00:34:23,770
My value will go down if I wait longer.

512
00:34:23,770 --> 00:34:25,820
You need to sell a product when the value is high.

513
00:34:25,820 --> 00:34:29,120
Honey...

514
00:34:30,890 --> 00:34:32,270
Mom, are you okay?

515
00:34:32,270 --> 00:34:34,030
Get out.

516
00:34:35,640 --> 00:34:39,510
Get out. Tell Father to come.

517
00:34:39,510 --> 00:34:41,590
Get up.

518
00:34:41,590 --> 00:34:44,050
Get out, I said!

519
00:34:44,830 --> 00:34:46,530
Get up.

520
00:36:57,850 --> 00:36:59,770
Stay there.

521
00:37:05,880 --> 00:37:07,330
Did you wait long?

522
00:37:07,330 --> 00:37:10,820
No, but waiting a little longer would've been fine, too,

523
00:37:10,820 --> 00:37:13,480
because the view here is amazing.

524
00:37:13,480 --> 00:37:15,050
You're right.

525
00:37:16,600 --> 00:37:19,650
I was surprised to see your text last night.

526
00:37:19,650 --> 00:37:21,150
What's this about?

527
00:37:21,150 --> 00:37:24,680
By chance, is it about the result?

528
00:37:25,380 --> 00:37:27,740
Do you remember this place?

529
00:37:27,740 --> 00:37:29,970
You brought me here every weekend.

530
00:37:29,970 --> 00:37:33,610
I remember the bus number that came here, too—no. 402.

531
00:37:34,700 --> 00:37:36,470
Should we walk a bit?

532
00:37:36,470 --> 00:37:37,920
Sounds good.

533
00:37:52,320 --> 00:37:55,210
You won't be able to join our academy.

534
00:37:55,210 --> 00:37:58,120
Pardon? Why not?

535
00:37:58,120 --> 00:38:01,170
Are you joking?

536
00:38:03,020 --> 00:38:05,130
Didn't I do a pretty good job?

537
00:38:05,130 --> 00:38:07,530
I'm not joking. You can't.

538
00:38:09,030 --> 00:38:13,960
Wow, the wall is higher than I thought.

539
00:38:13,960 --> 00:38:16,280
There's something I want to confirm.

540
00:38:16,280 --> 00:38:17,990
What is it?

541
00:38:17,990 --> 00:38:20,230
I'm very devastated right now.

542
00:38:20,230 --> 00:38:22,850
Did you look at other academies, too?

543
00:38:23,680 --> 00:38:25,720
No, not yet.

544
00:38:25,720 --> 00:38:29,460
But I'm checking the announcement on Teacher Land.

545
00:38:30,730 --> 00:38:33,320
I want you to think of the world

546
00:38:33,320 --> 00:38:36,790
with a broader, deeper, and more expanded vision

547
00:38:36,790 --> 00:38:39,800
among people who are wiser than you.

548
00:38:43,990 --> 00:38:46,910
The apartments that are more expensive than those.

549
00:38:46,910 --> 00:38:50,010
Larger space and higher level.

550
00:38:50,010 --> 00:38:52,360
Don't make those things a goal.

551
00:38:53,810 --> 00:38:55,450
That sounds trite.

552
00:38:56,970 --> 00:38:58,200
Sorry.

553
00:38:58,200 --> 00:39:00,770
No, you don't have to apologize.

554
00:39:05,600 --> 00:39:07,920
I lied.

555
00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:09,490
Pardon?

556
00:39:09,490 --> 00:39:14,080
I was lying when I said, "absolutely fantastic."

557
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:17,400
I bragged about making good money, but I was exaggerating.

558
00:39:17,400 --> 00:39:20,540
There are tons of people like me in Daechi-dong.

559
00:39:22,500 --> 00:39:27,590
But I got interested in teaching while practicing.

560
00:39:27,590 --> 00:39:32,000
I was lying when I said sending you to college was the highlight of my life, too.

561
00:39:33,300 --> 00:39:36,460
I started this to survive when I couldn't afford food, let alone tuition.

562
00:39:36,460 --> 00:39:38,620
Was I happy you went to a good school?

563
00:39:38,620 --> 00:39:39,760
It wasn't because of your success.

564
00:39:39,760 --> 00:39:44,210
It's because I was able to afford tuition since I was given a huge bonus.

565
00:39:44,210 --> 00:39:46,970
You said I'm a teacher you admire. Hey.

566
00:39:46,970 --> 00:39:49,600
I was so sick of bringing you to this library all the time.

567
00:39:49,600 --> 00:39:51,070
- I—
 - Okay.

568
00:39:51,070 --> 00:39:52,930
I understand.

569
00:39:52,930 --> 00:39:55,240
Let's stop there. Stop, Ms. Seo.

570
00:39:55,240 --> 00:39:56,690
I get it.

571
00:39:56,690 --> 00:39:59,920
I understand your true feelings...

572
00:40:03,430 --> 00:40:05,690
but aren't you crossing the line?

573
00:40:06,810 --> 00:40:08,240
What?

574
00:40:08,240 --> 00:40:13,110
So, you sent Lee Jun Ho to a good school and got a bonus thanks to me.

575
00:40:13,110 --> 00:40:15,110
That's all true.

576
00:40:15,110 --> 00:40:16,720
But...

577
00:40:17,620 --> 00:40:20,620
do I have to know how you feel, too?

578
00:40:22,180 --> 00:40:25,510
I never asked you how valuable this job is.

579
00:40:25,510 --> 00:40:28,450
I said I'd improve students' grades and get paid accordingly.

580
00:40:28,450 --> 00:40:30,610
Why are you bringing up other things?

581
00:40:30,610 --> 00:40:33,810
That doesn't affect me even this much.

582
00:40:33,810 --> 00:40:40,100
And I'm an applicant who took the exam and was assessed based on my ability.

583
00:40:40,100 --> 00:40:43,700
That you're going this far is kind of weird.

584
00:40:43,700 --> 00:40:45,630
What's so weird? I just want you to—

585
00:40:45,630 --> 00:40:50,180
Is it okay if the academy finds out you're doing this?

586
00:40:50,180 --> 00:40:54,760
Can I tell them you met an applicant personally and pressured him to quit?

587
00:41:02,370 --> 00:41:03,680
I'll get going now.

588
00:41:03,680 --> 00:41:06,210
Where are you going in the middle of a conversation? Your class starts at night.

589
00:41:06,210 --> 00:41:08,140
I have a meeting.

590
00:41:08,140 --> 00:41:10,070
Ms. Seo!

591
00:41:30,070 --> 00:41:32,140
Geez, why...

592
00:41:39,500 --> 00:41:41,740
I'll drive.

593
00:41:41,740 --> 00:41:45,150
- What?
 - You're in shock. Let me drive.

594
00:41:46,570 --> 00:41:48,240
I'm sorry but go on your own.

595
00:41:48,240 --> 00:41:50,440
Take the bus No. 402.

596
00:42:15,710 --> 00:42:17,670
So embarrassing.

597
00:42:18,990 --> 00:42:21,330
 Payment processed. 

598
00:42:26,690 --> 00:42:29,300
Let me stress this again.

599
00:42:29,300 --> 00:42:32,770
The exam will be based solely on the textbook.

600
00:42:33,470 --> 00:42:35,990
There's no exam material outside of the textbook,

601
00:42:35,990 --> 00:42:40,720
and the mock test questions will not include pieces that are outside of the textbook.

602
00:42:40,720 --> 00:42:44,990
But there will be more essay questions.

603
00:42:47,120 --> 00:42:53,080
I'll teach you what you should learn for the 10th-grade Korean exam.

604
00:42:53,080 --> 00:42:57,850
Only focus on the things that I teach you and put stress on.

605
00:42:57,850 --> 00:43:03,260
I'll do what I'm supposed to do as a teacher.

606
00:43:05,300 --> 00:43:09,630
Will the other teachers teach the same lesson, then?

607
00:43:09,630 --> 00:43:13,050
I have no control over what they teach.

608
00:43:13,050 --> 00:43:18,590
But they won't be able to create questions outside of what you learned.

609
00:43:21,300 --> 00:43:24,370
I don't care if you find your own way to study.

610
00:43:25,190 --> 00:43:30,190
You can keep going to the same academy, and you can use EBS, too.

611
00:43:32,090 --> 00:43:35,720
But I'll start an after-school supplementary class

612
00:43:35,720 --> 00:43:38,290
to take an in-depth look at the class material.

613
00:43:38,290 --> 00:43:40,330
Enroll the same way as usual.

614
00:43:40,330 --> 00:43:42,020
Any questions?

615
00:43:43,330 --> 00:43:44,840
Well, then.

616
00:43:51,500 --> 00:43:53,150
What's wrong with "Mr. Pleasant"?

617
00:43:53,150 --> 00:43:56,520
Is he crazy? What's the saying? The finals are coming up.

618
00:43:57,400 --> 00:44:00,480
I don't know. I'll ask my mom.

619
00:44:33,980 --> 00:44:36,850
Yes, Director. I'm in the parking lot—

620
00:44:37,570 --> 00:44:39,030
Pardon?

621
00:44:47,260 --> 00:44:51,030
- Hello. 
 - Hello.

622
00:44:52,690 --> 00:44:54,290
Director Sim.

623
00:44:54,290 --> 00:44:57,630
How is that Ms. Seo's fault?

624
00:44:57,630 --> 00:45:01,560
The school teacher made a brave decision.

625
00:45:01,560 --> 00:45:03,600
Come on in.

626
00:45:04,650 --> 00:45:06,670
Pardon? Gosh.

627
00:45:06,670 --> 00:45:08,310
Codestruction?

628
00:45:08,310 --> 00:45:11,420
Aren't you being too harsh?

629
00:45:11,420 --> 00:45:14,220
What do you mean by beg for forgiveness?

630
00:45:14,220 --> 00:45:17,150
Director, why don't we just meet up this evening?

631
00:45:17,150 --> 00:45:19,260
I'll buy you a drink.

632
00:45:19,260 --> 00:45:20,650
Okay.

633
00:45:20,650 --> 00:45:23,870
Why don't you yell at me in person, instead?

634
00:45:23,870 --> 00:45:25,620
Okay.

635
00:45:28,590 --> 00:45:31,710
Aigoo. His academy won't grow because his feelings fluctuate so much.

636
00:45:31,710 --> 00:45:34,190
He's such a petty man.

637
00:45:34,190 --> 00:45:35,850
What's going on?

638
00:45:35,850 --> 00:45:39,760
The problematic teacher at Chanyeong High made an announcement.

639
00:45:39,760 --> 00:45:42,810
He said the finals will be based 100% on the textbook,

640
00:45:42,810 --> 00:45:46,170
have more essay questions, and he'll have an intensive class after school.

641
00:45:46,170 --> 00:45:47,870
So?

642
00:45:47,870 --> 00:45:52,750
The students are panicking, and the academies are in shock.

643
00:45:53,860 --> 00:45:56,450
So, they want me to go and beg for forgiveness?

644
00:45:56,450 --> 00:46:00,160
Come on. I won't let you even if you want to.

645
00:46:00,160 --> 00:46:01,980
I'll do it if necessary.

646
00:46:01,980 --> 00:46:04,500
I'm good at kneeling.

647
00:46:05,860 --> 00:46:10,210
But still, we'll have to be prepared somehow.

648
00:46:16,220 --> 00:46:21,220
The students won't quit the academy because he changed direction.

649
00:46:21,220 --> 00:46:24,090
They'll have to rely on us more since they aren't used to it.

650
00:46:24,090 --> 00:46:25,850
I suppose.

651
00:46:25,850 --> 00:46:27,610
It'll definitely be less discriminating,

652
00:46:27,610 --> 00:46:30,110
and the average to bottom students will think of it as a chance,

653
00:46:30,110 --> 00:46:33,780
and the top students will try their best to secure their grades.

654
00:46:33,780 --> 00:46:38,910
That's true, but things are already getting too shaky to just be optimistic about it.

655
00:46:38,910 --> 00:46:40,690
They're already calling for counseling, too.

656
00:46:40,690 --> 00:46:43,720
There'll be turmoil, but it will be the same with the other academies.

657
00:46:43,720 --> 00:46:45,270
Yes.

658
00:46:47,190 --> 00:46:50,460
I'll try focusing on the average to bottom ones more.

659
00:46:50,460 --> 00:46:53,740
If we have a few kids whose grades go up drastically—

660
00:46:53,740 --> 00:46:55,820
That'll take care of things until next year, huh?

661
00:46:55,820 --> 00:47:01,370
The 9th graders who will attend Chanyeong High won't be able to choose teachers other than me.

662
00:47:02,990 --> 00:47:06,700
I'm just worried it'll be too much for you.

663
00:47:06,700 --> 00:47:12,080
I care about you way more than a few students.

664
00:47:12,080 --> 00:47:15,580
I'm thankful to hear you say that.

665
00:47:19,840 --> 00:47:21,450
 - Quality!
 - The best! 

666
00:47:21,450 --> 00:47:23,940
 - Let's be...
 - Safe! 

667
00:47:23,940 --> 00:47:29,000
 Daechi-dong Restaurant Hagfish 

668
00:47:33,240 --> 00:47:35,080
Let me...

669
00:47:35,720 --> 00:47:37,440
There's one there.

670
00:47:38,340 --> 00:47:40,640
Leave it there. I'll do it.

671
00:47:41,490 --> 00:47:45,340
Material prices are skyrocketing all over the world.

672
00:47:45,340 --> 00:47:50,040
Exporting will be an issue if the interest rate in the US keeps going up.

673
00:47:58,310 --> 00:48:00,260
Drink slowly.

674
00:48:08,550 --> 00:48:12,510
It might look boring and stuffy,

675
00:48:13,310 --> 00:48:16,480
but you're supposed to live like that. Like others.

676
00:48:19,640 --> 00:48:23,930
Try studying more if you don't want to. I'll help.

677
00:48:26,690 --> 00:48:29,570
I totally understand what you're thinking.

678
00:48:30,360 --> 00:48:32,030
Father.

679
00:48:32,030 --> 00:48:33,530
Yes?

680
00:48:34,160 --> 00:48:36,040
I'll get my own place.

681
00:48:36,730 --> 00:48:38,520
What?

682
00:48:38,520 --> 00:48:44,130
Don't try to help me, and don't look for a solution.

683
00:48:44,130 --> 00:48:46,240
- Lee Jun Ho.
 - I...

684
00:48:46,240 --> 00:48:48,510
will come back with a bank book that receives tens of millions every month

685
00:48:48,510 --> 00:48:51,180
along with a contract for a newly built Gangnam apartment.

686
00:48:52,800 --> 00:48:55,330
You never got to have that, right?

687
00:49:06,960 --> 00:49:11,220
Working for a corporation could be hard.

688
00:49:12,120 --> 00:49:15,280
You can look for a stable, medium-sized company.

689
00:49:16,280 --> 00:49:19,130
Did you find working for a company hard?

690
00:49:19,930 --> 00:49:21,790
I didn't.

691
00:50:01,490 --> 00:50:03,410
Should I take the grill out?

692
00:50:03,410 --> 00:50:04,960
No.

693
00:50:09,770 --> 00:50:14,300
 I'm thinking that right here. It's the same with people's dreams. 

694
00:50:20,870 --> 00:50:23,140
 Aren't you crossing the line? 

695
00:50:39,530 --> 00:50:42,860
How about Director Sim? Did you comfort him?

696
00:50:42,860 --> 00:50:45,260
He was so noisy. I was dying.

697
00:50:47,810 --> 00:50:51,940
I was about to go home, but the lights were on in here.

698
00:50:51,940 --> 00:50:55,290
So, I thought it had to be Seo Hye Jin at this hour.

699
00:50:56,120 --> 00:50:58,670
This reminds me of the old days

700
00:50:58,670 --> 00:51:01,090
back when we had nothing.

701
00:51:01,090 --> 00:51:03,520
I drank tons of soju in a corner of the academy.

702
00:51:03,520 --> 00:51:06,340
You taught me how to drink, Director.

703
00:51:10,670 --> 00:51:14,310
After I failed miserably with the film I made with my friends' money

704
00:51:14,310 --> 00:51:17,370
and joined the academy...

705
00:51:17,370 --> 00:51:20,180
I couldn't even imagine this day would come.

706
00:51:20,180 --> 00:51:23,090
You were actually kind of cool back then.

707
00:51:23,090 --> 00:51:24,760
A filmmaker who was trying to make a comeback.

708
00:51:24,760 --> 00:51:28,140
- Really?
 - Yes. I like your films.

709
00:51:28,140 --> 00:51:30,640
I just can't recommend them to other people.

710
00:51:30,640 --> 00:51:32,460
Come on.

711
00:51:34,430 --> 00:51:38,270
There was a theater called Piccadilly in Jongno back then.

712
00:51:38,270 --> 00:51:39,860
Yes, I know.

713
00:51:39,860 --> 00:51:45,980
There was a row of handprints on the sidewalk in the front.

714
00:51:45,980 --> 00:51:51,470
It was my dream to make my handprint with my actors there.

715
00:51:52,640 --> 00:51:56,870
But I'm just commemorating the students' entrance exam accomplishments.

716
00:51:58,400 --> 00:52:00,380
What do you mean by "just"?

717
00:52:00,380 --> 00:52:02,990
It's a very meaningful thing.

718
00:52:03,760 --> 00:52:05,220
Do you really think so?

719
00:52:05,220 --> 00:52:07,390
Of course I do.

720
00:52:09,320 --> 00:52:13,860
So, why are you trying to act like his mentor?

721
00:52:15,010 --> 00:52:17,190
To Jun Ho, I mean.

722
00:52:56,660 --> 00:53:00,420
I can't bring myself to call you "Teacher."

723
00:53:00,420 --> 00:53:02,630
Aren't you crossing the line?

724
00:53:03,460 --> 00:53:07,060
So, why are you trying to act like a mentor?

725
00:54:11,670 --> 00:54:13,210
 Daechi Chase 

726
00:54:13,210 --> 00:54:15,510
 You're doing the right thing. 

727
00:54:15,510 --> 00:54:18,470
I'm grateful you changed your mind.

728
00:54:18,470 --> 00:54:21,630
You're willing to invest in a new talent.

729
00:54:21,630 --> 00:54:24,030
I should support you.

730
00:54:25,900 --> 00:54:28,700
- I'm curious about one thing.
 - Huh?

731
00:54:28,700 --> 00:54:33,630
What would you have done if I kept opposing it?

732
00:54:33,630 --> 00:54:36,960
I don't know. I never thought about it.

733
00:54:36,960 --> 00:54:41,640
- Why not?
 - I just had a feeling Lee Jun Ho would be mine.

734
00:54:41,640 --> 00:54:43,400
It was a gut feeling.

735
00:54:47,040 --> 00:54:49,400
I have a favor to ask, Director.

736
00:54:49,400 --> 00:54:53,700
 Try picturing this image in your head. 

737
00:54:53,700 --> 00:54:57,970
 An old gentleman came running from a rice field 

738
00:54:57,970 --> 00:55:00,320
 and held onto your ankle tightly. 

739
00:55:00,320 --> 00:55:02,930
What? He's handsome.

740
00:55:02,930 --> 00:55:06,310
Look at how he's using the chalk, not his face.

741
00:55:06,310 --> 00:55:08,550
I think my handwriting is better.

742
00:55:08,550 --> 00:55:10,200
He practiced writing on the chalkboard a lot.

743
00:55:10,200 --> 00:55:13,690
He uses colors cleverly so you get the point clearly.

744
00:55:13,690 --> 00:55:16,320
He could work for a major online academy.

745
00:55:17,130 --> 00:55:19,540
The camera loves him.

746
00:55:19,540 --> 00:55:22,070
That's probably his goal, too.

747
00:55:23,670 --> 00:55:27,300
Team Leader, is Lee Jun Ho not going to make the cut?

748
00:55:27,300 --> 00:55:28,790
That'd be a shame.

749
00:55:28,790 --> 00:55:31,820
No, he will. He'll be joining us.

750
00:55:38,860 --> 00:55:41,560
I thought I was overreacting.

751
00:55:41,560 --> 00:55:42,950
You weren't.

752
00:55:42,950 --> 00:55:44,870
I can see why you were shocked.

753
00:55:44,870 --> 00:55:46,450
Sending him to college should've been enough.

754
00:55:46,450 --> 00:55:49,890
I realized I was acting like a great mentor or something.

755
00:55:49,890 --> 00:55:52,660
You don't have to go that far.

756
00:55:53,460 --> 00:55:55,870
Not to mention the Chanyeong High incident.

757
00:55:55,870 --> 00:55:57,110
I have enough on my plate.

758
00:55:57,110 --> 00:55:59,910
I have no energy to worry about Jun Ho, too.

759
00:55:59,910 --> 00:56:03,070
Yes. He's no longer a kid anymore, either.

760
00:56:03,070 --> 00:56:04,640
I know.

761
00:56:04,640 --> 00:56:07,190
He's no longer a kid.

762
00:56:09,590 --> 00:56:11,410
Would you like a drink afterward?

763
00:56:11,410 --> 00:56:13,200
I'll treat you.

764
00:56:13,200 --> 00:56:15,440
I'm meeting someone later.

765
00:56:32,970 --> 00:56:34,620
Right, right.

766
00:56:35,300 --> 00:56:36,930
- This is for Hui Seon.
 - Okay.

767
00:56:36,930 --> 00:56:40,040
Don't give it to the receptionist. Give it directly to the bride's assistant.

768
00:56:40,040 --> 00:56:42,060
Don't forget to tell her I'm sorry.

769
00:56:42,060 --> 00:56:43,980
I can tell from the thickness.

770
00:56:43,980 --> 00:56:46,780
Don't be sorry. She'll be your favorite guest.

771
00:56:46,780 --> 00:56:48,550
I used a trick.

772
00:56:48,550 --> 00:56:51,100
I wrote a letter because I felt bad about not making it.

773
00:56:51,100 --> 00:56:52,950
The money gift is just a bonus.

774
00:56:52,950 --> 00:56:56,720
Hye Jin, writing a letter is dangerous.

775
00:56:56,720 --> 00:57:01,110
She cried for two hours on the plane on our way to our honeymoon

776
00:57:01,110 --> 00:57:03,530
because of your letter.

777
00:57:04,200 --> 00:57:06,420
You didn't have to write this.

778
00:57:06,420 --> 00:57:09,080
We all understand you work on weekends.

779
00:57:09,080 --> 00:57:10,790
You should've rested your wrist.

780
00:57:10,790 --> 00:57:12,650
My wrist...

781
00:57:15,290 --> 00:57:16,500
Hello, welcome.

782
00:57:16,500 --> 00:57:19,510
Hello. Hello.

783
00:57:19,510 --> 00:57:22,220
So Yeong, I'm sorry. I'll talk to him briefly.

784
00:57:22,220 --> 00:57:24,670
Take your time. Take your time.

785
00:58:13,610 --> 00:58:15,980
Did you tell your parents?

786
00:58:15,980 --> 00:58:17,800
Yes.

787
00:58:17,800 --> 00:58:19,740
You won't give up, right?

788
00:58:19,740 --> 00:58:21,210
No.

789
00:58:21,210 --> 00:58:25,690
I might as well aim for the entrance exam market at a major academy.

790
00:58:25,690 --> 00:58:28,120
It's supposed to be hard without experience or connection,

791
00:58:28,120 --> 00:58:30,270
but my qualifications are good enough.

792
00:58:31,070 --> 00:58:34,120
First of all, I apologize.

793
00:58:34,120 --> 00:58:35,360
What for?

794
00:58:35,360 --> 00:58:38,680
For crossing the line. I'm sorry.

795
00:58:38,680 --> 00:58:40,520
I hurt your feelings.

796
00:58:42,120 --> 00:58:43,690
You're cool, Ms. Seo.

797
00:58:43,690 --> 00:58:46,380
I'll be cool and accept your apology, too.

798
00:58:46,380 --> 00:58:48,170
Thank you.

799
00:58:53,780 --> 00:58:55,800
- Thank you.
 - Thank you.

800
00:59:02,630 --> 00:59:05,620
Listen carefully to what I'm about to say.

801
00:59:05,620 --> 00:59:07,280
Okay.

802
00:59:07,280 --> 00:59:09,980
It won't be so much fun from now on.

803
00:59:11,880 --> 00:59:15,280
There's no solidarity or loyalty between co-workers.

804
00:59:15,280 --> 00:59:19,390
Three hours on the podium and working 12 hours on the weekend are nothing.

805
00:59:19,390 --> 00:59:22,470
The rest of it would be a lot harder.

806
00:59:22,470 --> 00:59:26,460
No one will help you join a major online academy, either.

807
00:59:26,460 --> 00:59:29,000
You need to develop on your own.

808
00:59:30,230 --> 00:59:32,980
A-Are you hiring me?

809
00:59:32,980 --> 00:59:34,830
All the lecturers are your competitors.

810
00:59:34,830 --> 00:59:36,810
And there is a set amount of students.

811
00:59:36,810 --> 00:59:40,300
You'll be sharing a pie with everyone else.

812
00:59:40,300 --> 00:59:44,690
Everyone will either attack you...

813
00:59:44,690 --> 00:59:46,550
or use you.

814
00:59:46,550 --> 00:59:48,070
It'd be one or the other.

815
00:59:48,070 --> 00:59:51,190
- Which means—
 - You'd be like that, too?

816
00:59:52,040 --> 00:59:54,580
Can't you say something hopeful to cheer me up?

817
00:59:54,580 --> 00:59:57,470
Your happiness will depend on losing or gaining a student.

818
00:59:57,470 --> 01:00:01,230
They quit whether their grades go up or down.

819
01:00:01,230 --> 01:00:03,360
If they go up, it's because they're good.

820
01:00:03,360 --> 01:00:06,600
If they go down, it's the lecturer's fault.

821
01:00:06,600 --> 01:00:09,710
They quit whether the class is easy or hard.

822
01:00:09,710 --> 01:00:11,940
If it's easy, it's because they're good.

823
01:00:11,940 --> 01:00:14,940
If it's hard, it's because the lecturer is incompetent.

824
01:00:15,950 --> 01:00:18,820
You should be grateful if they quit quietly.

825
01:00:18,820 --> 01:00:20,570
They often spread a malicious rumor,

826
01:00:20,570 --> 01:00:24,960
or shut down a class by leaving with their friends.

827
01:00:25,700 --> 01:00:30,040
And no one knows how long it'll take to recover from it.

828
01:00:30,040 --> 01:00:32,150
And your income would hit rock bottom.

829
01:00:32,150 --> 01:00:35,570
In the worst-case scenario, you get fired.

830
01:00:38,350 --> 01:00:40,650
Did something happen?

831
01:00:43,980 --> 01:00:46,340
You can tell your teacher everything.

832
01:00:51,790 --> 01:00:53,790
Mr. Lee Jun Ho.

833
01:00:54,570 --> 01:00:58,360
- Pardon?
 - Let me tell you one more thing.

834
01:00:58,360 --> 01:01:00,490
Well, M-Ms. Seo—

835
01:01:00,490 --> 01:01:03,650
I worked in Daechi-dong for 14 years.

836
01:01:03,650 --> 01:01:06,850
I've put dozens of students on top of their classes up to now.

837
01:01:06,850 --> 01:01:11,090
As you know, I'm an expert at improving grades.

838
01:01:11,730 --> 01:01:15,300
- What are you doing?
 - The other lecturer we hired is 32 years old.

839
01:01:15,300 --> 01:01:17,160
She's been lecturing for eight years.

840
01:01:17,160 --> 01:01:19,340
In Dongtan, Mapo, Mok-dong, and Junggye-dong,

841
01:01:19,340 --> 01:01:22,710
she's been teaching without taking a month off.

842
01:01:22,710 --> 01:01:24,480
She has written a textbook,

843
01:01:24,480 --> 01:01:28,210
is experienced in small, medium, and large lectures.

844
01:01:28,210 --> 01:01:32,390
She's a powerhouse who's been putting students on top of their classes every year.

845
01:01:32,390 --> 01:01:34,770
Even I'm nervous right now.

846
01:01:37,480 --> 01:01:42,480
I'm saying you won't have time to joke around with me in the future.

847
01:01:50,980 --> 01:01:54,290
You may leave, Mr. Lee Jun Ho.

848
01:01:59,910 --> 01:02:01,450
Okay.

849
01:02:43,190 --> 01:02:45,460
Why are you so angry?

850
01:02:45,460 --> 01:02:46,790
You were relentless.

851
01:02:46,790 --> 01:02:49,740
What do you mean? I just warned him.

852
01:02:50,870 --> 01:02:52,450
Who is he?

853
01:02:52,450 --> 01:02:56,400
The first student I taught while I was taking time off from school.

854
01:02:56,400 --> 01:02:59,010
Huh? Oh, that dummy?

855
01:02:59,010 --> 01:03:01,010
He's not a dummy.

You said hello to each other, right?

- Yes, we're all done. 
 - Nice.

862
01:03:24,330 --> 01:03:28,180
Ms. Kim and Ms. Jeong, I'm sure both of you are busy,

863
01:03:28,180 --> 01:03:30,980
but please help the new teachers adjust.

- Okay.
 - Okay.

865

New teachers, choose the schools you want to be in charge of and let me know.

It's almost finals, and the 9th graders will be flooding in soon, too.

867
01:03:39,760 --> 01:03:42,260
You have to prepare the orientation for the parents yourselves first.

 - Okay.

869

Let me tell you about the Korean department's schedule and lecture rooms.

870
01:03:45,860 --> 01:03:48,400
First, we don't have lectures on Mondays.

871
01:03:48,400 --> 01:03:51,090
You're all here today since it's your first day,

872
01:03:51,090 --> 01:03:52,580
but you're not required to come in on Mondays.

873
01:03:52,580 --> 01:03:54,370
And Ms. Kim?

874
01:03:54,370 --> 01:03:56,290
Oh, yes.

875
01:03:56,290 --> 01:04:00,390
I did research since you asked me to...

876
01:04:00,390 --> 01:04:02,790
Let's go to the teachers' office.

877
01:04:05,850 --> 01:04:06,910
Hello.

878
01:04:06,910 --> 01:04:08,510
Good to see you.

879
01:04:08,510 --> 01:04:12,120
I should call you Mr. Lee now, right?

880
01:04:12,790 --> 01:04:14,700
I'm in your care.

881
01:04:15,790 --> 01:04:18,930
Be good. You upset Ms. Seo a lot.

882
01:04:18,930 --> 01:04:20,680
Okay.

883
01:04:20,680 --> 01:04:22,540
Okay, get going. Let's catch up later.

Okay. 
 ♫  Oh the greatness I foresee  ♫

885

♫  Just don't forget about me.  ♫

886
01:04:31,260 --> 01:04:34,140
All right. Let's go.

887
01:04:34,140 --> 01:04:36,830
Mr. Lee, focus on writing the curriculum.

888
01:04:36,830 --> 01:04:41,500
- Writing your own curriculum is a basic requirement to succeed as a lecturer. 
- Okay.

889
01:04:41,500 --> 01:04:44,510
These are your desks. Pick whichever you want.

890
01:04:44,510 --> 01:04:46,020
Should I take this one?

891
01:04:46,020 --> 01:04:47,440
Okay.

892
01:04:51,250 --> 01:04:55,540
Team Leader, Director wants to see Mr. Lee.

893
01:04:55,540 --> 01:04:57,900
Mr. Lee, you can go.

894
01:04:57,900 --> 01:04:59,970
Come to the director's office.

895
01:05:09,120 --> 01:05:11,270
So how does it feel

896
01:05:11,270 --> 01:05:13,900
to finally become a teacher?

897
01:05:14,650 --> 01:05:18,430
It's still a bit awkward, but it's fun.

898
01:05:18,430 --> 01:05:20,070
You let your parents know?

899
01:05:20,070 --> 01:05:21,600
Yes.

900
01:05:21,600 --> 01:05:24,740
What did they say? They must've been surprised.

901
01:05:25,640 --> 01:05:27,110
They're still recovering.

902
01:05:27,110 --> 01:05:29,310
They were surprised quite a bit.

903
01:05:29,310 --> 01:05:31,970
You mean it's official now, right?

904
01:05:31,970 --> 01:05:33,490
Well, you can talk to me casually.

905
01:05:33,490 --> 01:05:38,320
No, I can't do that. You're a teacher now.

906
01:05:39,090 --> 01:05:42,400
I find it so moving.

907
01:05:42,400 --> 01:05:44,650
You were once our academy's treasure

908
01:05:44,650 --> 01:05:49,240
and you were our symbol and identity.

909
01:05:49,240 --> 01:05:52,960
But you returned as a teacher.

910
01:05:52,960 --> 01:05:55,020
Thank you.

911
01:05:55,020 --> 01:06:00,480
Since we're on the topic, I'd like to make a suggestion.

912
01:06:00,480 --> 01:06:04,260
- Please go ahead.
 - I don't give this opportunity to anyone.

913
01:06:07,300 --> 01:06:13,400
I want Lecturer Lee Jun Ho to become the face of the academy in our advertising.

914
01:06:15,100 --> 01:06:16,660
What do you say?

915
01:06:17,590 --> 01:06:19,710
Isn't that Ms. Seo's job?

916
01:06:19,710 --> 01:06:20,990
Yes.

917
01:06:20,990 --> 01:06:23,420
Am I qualified for it?

918
01:06:23,420 --> 01:06:26,770
Your story itself qualifies you.

919
01:06:26,770 --> 01:06:29,960
This will be a great boost for a new lecturer.

I like how decisive you are.

923
01:06:38,250 --> 01:06:40,460
The ad won't be everything.

924
01:06:40,460 --> 01:06:43,900
Don't forget that the best ad is your ability and word of mouth.

925
01:06:43,900 --> 01:06:46,290
Yes. I'll do my best.

926
