I wanted us to live well for a thousand years.

Don't feel bad for me.

19

Don't get scared, either.

20

Ask me anything.

desire to touch me, and tell me you'll feed me.

 Episode 14 

34

35
00:03:37,470 --> 00:03:39,450
That's all I need.

36
00:04:44,750 --> 00:04:47,020
Jun Ho has a girlfriend.

37
00:04:49,450 --> 00:04:52,680
She's his old academy teacher.

38
00:04:54,970 --> 00:04:57,110
Be more specific.

39
00:04:57,110 --> 00:05:00,450
He had too many academy teachers.

40
00:05:00,450 --> 00:05:05,380
The Korean teacher who taught him when his scores suddenly improved.

41
00:05:06,940 --> 00:05:09,420
The one who taught Eun Ho, too?

42
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:13,450
I'm so upset, but...

43
00:05:13,450 --> 00:05:15,860
Why are you upset?

44
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:19,510
That's what I don't know.

45
00:05:19,510 --> 00:05:24,050
I want to be against it, but I'm not sure why.

46
00:05:25,110 --> 00:05:29,170
Should I take issue with her age first?

47
00:05:34,660 --> 00:05:38,440
You should tell him to come and have a talk.

48
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:41,290
You want me to get involved in my adult son's relationship?

49
00:05:41,290 --> 00:05:46,590
I just let it go when I noticed he was seeing someone.

50
00:05:46,590 --> 00:05:50,420
But I have a bad feeling now that I know who.

51
00:05:50,420 --> 00:05:52,230
What bad feeling?

52
00:05:52,230 --> 00:05:55,020
I think it will last a long time.

53
00:05:59,300 --> 00:06:01,490
Just wait and see.

54
00:06:01,490 --> 00:06:06,340
Trying to pull them apart when they're at the peak of passion is something that makes them closer.

55
00:06:08,310 --> 00:06:11,110
Did you do something by chance?

56
00:06:11,110 --> 00:06:14,730
Well, I punched—

57
00:06:14,730 --> 00:06:15,910
The teacher?

58
00:06:15,910 --> 00:06:18,340
Are you crazy?

59
00:06:21,410 --> 00:06:23,160
I'm so sorry. I am freaking out!

60
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:25,120
I must've been tired.

61
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:27,180
I just got up.

62
00:06:27,180 --> 00:06:29,140
That's why I didn't wake you up.

63
00:06:29,140 --> 00:06:31,800
I'll take the subway. Don't worry.

64
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:34,770
See you later.

65
00:07:03,760 --> 00:07:05,670
Hello.

66
00:07:08,940 --> 00:07:10,920
Hello.

67
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:16,300
Good morning.

68
00:07:17,080 --> 00:07:19,540
Yeah, right.

69
00:07:19,540 --> 00:07:21,320
Hello.

70
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:45,160
Is Team Leader Min not coming?

71
00:07:45,160 --> 00:07:47,050
She's on the way.

72
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:55,290
Should we start talking, just among us?

73
00:08:07,300 --> 00:08:09,250
Yes, sure.

74
00:08:09,250 --> 00:08:11,680
It's just as I said in the text last night.

75
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:13,530
What I'm taking issue with is

76
00:08:13,530 --> 00:08:19,210
that the academy's resources were being used on one person—

77
00:08:31,150 --> 00:08:33,140
Let me join you, too.

78
00:08:37,050 --> 00:08:38,390
Yes, Mom.

79
00:08:38,390 --> 00:08:40,790
Did Byeol take the shot?

80
00:08:40,790 --> 00:08:43,730
The line at the children's hospital is crazy, right?

81
00:08:43,730 --> 00:08:48,790
The schedule didn't change. It's just a meeting.

82
00:08:48,790 --> 00:08:51,760
Take him to your place, not mine.

83
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:53,760
My place is a total mess right now.

84
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:55,380
Okay.

85
00:08:59,950 --> 00:09:02,350
Come here. Come.

86
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:23,150
Go wait somewhere.

87
00:09:23,150 --> 00:09:26,800
I'll tell you what we talked about.

88
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:28,900
Let me explain.

89
00:09:30,770 --> 00:09:32,740
Explain?

90
00:09:32,740 --> 00:09:34,500
Justify?

91
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:40,320
I don't think stuff like that could fix this.

92
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:44,460
You're all educated, and you teach children.

93
00:09:44,460 --> 00:09:46,620
If I explain rationally—

94
00:09:46,620 --> 00:09:48,650
Goodness ...

95
00:09:48,650 --> 00:09:52,510
Lee Jun Ho,  Your Highness Teacher!

96
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:58,970
The problem is that they're educated, and they teach students.

97
00:10:00,710 --> 00:10:03,130
What do you mean?

98
00:10:03,130 --> 00:10:08,250
Things will get worse since they're all rational.

99
00:10:08,250 --> 00:10:10,770
And tons of people inside and outside the academy have been waiting

100
00:10:10,770 --> 00:10:13,730
for Team Leader Seo Hye Jin to fail.

101
00:10:21,380 --> 00:10:25,230
You're stubborn, Mr. Lee.

102
00:10:29,340 --> 00:10:31,870
Do you want to hear a horror story?

103
00:10:33,370 --> 00:10:35,280
This happened in another neighborhood.

104
00:10:35,280 --> 00:10:40,130
An academy lecturer who had the most students from some high school got cancer.

105
00:10:40,130 --> 00:10:43,690
It was still in an early stage, and it was curable.

106
00:10:43,690 --> 00:10:45,580
But in less than a day,

107
00:10:45,580 --> 00:10:50,770
the rumor that he was terminally ill and would be dying soon spread.

108
00:10:51,540 --> 00:10:56,250
They spread that rumor to steal the students.

109
00:10:57,840 --> 00:11:00,330
That's how this industry is.

110
00:11:04,110 --> 00:11:08,130
I don't think Team Leader Seo and you

111
00:11:08,130 --> 00:11:13,850
did anything that's so bad.

112
00:11:16,260 --> 00:11:18,400
So...

113
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:24,700
go out and wait while drinking coffee, huh?

114
00:11:26,540 --> 00:11:29,210
I'm asking who told you to come.

115
00:11:29,210 --> 00:11:31,020
Listen to me. I'll keep it short.

116
00:11:31,020 --> 00:11:32,660
I asked who told you?

117
00:11:32,660 --> 00:11:34,270
I did.

118
00:11:34,270 --> 00:11:35,640
What?

119
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:38,480
We'll talk amongst ourselves for a bit.

120
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:43,990
But isn't it okay to listen to Team Leader Seo?

121
00:11:44,710 --> 00:11:48,740
It'd be hard to be objective, then.

122
00:11:48,740 --> 00:11:51,470
I don't even know why she needs to explain.

123
00:11:51,470 --> 00:11:56,690
No, hold on. It's not just that they fell for each other.

124
00:11:56,690 --> 00:11:59,920
She's supposed to be a team leader

125
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:02,450
and the leading lecturer of this academy.

126
00:12:02,450 --> 00:12:06,010
Yet she used her power to give the new teacher privileges, perks,

127
00:12:06,010 --> 00:12:08,780
and stuff like that. That's what I'm saying.

128
00:12:08,780 --> 00:12:11,590
The ad was suspicious, too.

129
00:12:11,590 --> 00:12:14,250
"Teacher-Pupil Tag Team?" How corny.

130
00:12:14,250 --> 00:12:16,740
Let me talk about the ad first.

131
00:12:16,740 --> 00:12:18,820
Huiwon High is our academy's—

132
00:12:18,820 --> 00:12:24,150
Shouldn't you tell us if you're really dating first?

133
00:12:27,390 --> 00:12:29,640
Mr. Lee is...

134
00:12:32,090 --> 00:12:33,870
I...

135
00:12:43,640 --> 00:12:45,430
What are you trying to do now?

136
00:12:45,430 --> 00:12:48,530
You want to blatantly act as a pair now?

137
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:57,580
Did you plan for a teary press conference or something?

138
00:12:57,580 --> 00:13:00,490
It's not like that. I didn't know Team Leader Seo was here—

139
00:13:00,490 --> 00:13:04,780
What do you mean, you don't know? I know you're basically living together.

140
00:13:20,640 --> 00:13:22,640
Team Leader Lee.

141
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:25,400
Yes. What?

142
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:28,250
Can I talk to you, putting our ranking aside?

143
00:13:29,180 --> 00:13:30,560
What?

144
00:13:41,220 --> 00:13:43,840
Son, I'm leaving now.

145
00:13:43,840 --> 00:13:46,170
- Already?
 - Yes, I'm busy.

146
00:13:53,350 --> 00:13:56,380
Is this about the text from last night?

147
00:13:57,870 --> 00:14:02,460
So what if their colleagues are dating? What's the big deal?

148
00:14:02,460 --> 00:14:05,950
Didn't you let Jun Ho teach that class?

149
00:14:05,950 --> 00:14:07,950
Be quiet if you don't know.

150
00:14:07,950 --> 00:14:09,540
What do I not know?

151
00:14:09,540 --> 00:14:11,420
How parents feel.

152
00:14:11,420 --> 00:14:13,200
What are you talking about?

153
00:14:13,870 --> 00:14:17,150
To send their child to a good school,

154
00:14:17,150 --> 00:14:21,270
the mothers, fathers, grandmothers, and grandfathers are all

155
00:14:21,270 --> 00:14:23,250
making a fuss about it.

156
00:14:23,250 --> 00:14:25,580
But the teachers were doing that at the academy?

157
00:14:25,580 --> 00:14:27,460
How could they let someone like that teach their child?

158
00:14:27,460 --> 00:14:29,300
What do you think they did?

159
00:14:29,300 --> 00:14:32,480
What kind of rumors spread overnight, anyway?

160
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:34,890
I'm just predicting how this will go.

161
00:14:38,500 --> 00:14:40,440
It started.

162
00:14:42,380 --> 00:14:45,270
Yes, Ah Jeong's mother.

163
00:14:45,270 --> 00:14:48,800
Yes, yes. What made you call so early?

164
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:51,850
Pardon? No.

165
00:15:09,860 --> 00:15:13,750
 Hey, looks like there's a weird rumor about you. 

166
00:15:23,620 --> 00:15:25,380
 Are you okay? 

167
00:15:34,040 --> 00:15:37,400
What did you say to me? After what you guys did?

168
00:15:37,400 --> 00:15:39,680
I said I pity your students!

169
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:42,550
"You?" Come here, you bastard!

170
00:15:42,550 --> 00:15:45,410
We don't live together, and we didn't do anything shameful.

171
00:15:45,410 --> 00:15:47,230
Why are you calling me names?

172
00:15:47,230 --> 00:15:49,390
Did you hear him just now?

173
00:15:49,390 --> 00:15:51,910
The students are about to come! Stop!

174
00:15:51,910 --> 00:15:54,290
Let go! I'm calm.

175
00:15:54,290 --> 00:15:56,240
Gosh, what a joke.

176
00:15:56,240 --> 00:15:57,980
Team Leader.

177
00:15:58,760 --> 00:16:01,640
This isn't right.

178
00:16:01,640 --> 00:16:04,050
- What?
 - Please.

179
00:16:04,050 --> 00:16:06,120
Please let us talk calmly. Let's try again—

180
00:16:06,120 --> 00:16:08,180
What's the point of talking calmly?

181
00:16:08,180 --> 00:16:11,400
- Jun Ho's behavior explains everything. 
- Team Leader.

182
00:16:13,330 --> 00:16:15,230
Team Leader,

183
00:16:15,230 --> 00:16:18,430
I don't think you have time for this.

184
00:16:22,130 --> 00:16:23,800
Okay.

185
00:16:28,730 --> 00:16:29,950
Why are you giving this to me?

186
00:16:29,950 --> 00:16:33,700
You have pretty handwriting. I haven't handwritten things in a long time.

187
00:16:33,700 --> 00:16:35,420
What should I write?

188
00:16:35,420 --> 00:16:38,670
Thank him for letting you do well in the finals.

189
00:16:38,670 --> 00:16:40,850
And ask for good results next year, too.

190
00:16:40,850 --> 00:16:43,520
Shouldn't you say that to my teachers instead?

191
00:16:43,520 --> 00:16:48,620
I pay them every month. It's a lot of money.

192
00:16:48,620 --> 00:16:51,760
Write quickly and go to the academy. Pray quickly, too.

193
00:16:58,020 --> 00:17:00,130
- Seong Ha Yul.
 - Yes.

194
00:17:00,130 --> 00:17:03,350
Give me Seo Hye Jin's textbook. The handouts and the homework, too.

195
00:17:03,350 --> 00:17:05,080
All of a sudden? Here?

196
00:17:05,080 --> 00:17:06,730
Hurry.

197
00:17:23,260 --> 00:17:24,900
How about the rest?

198
00:17:24,900 --> 00:17:26,490
I don't have the handouts.

199
00:17:26,490 --> 00:17:29,530
The homework is previewing what we'll learn next.

200
00:17:29,530 --> 00:17:31,450
- Is that all?
 - Yes.

201
00:17:31,450 --> 00:17:34,210
She wanted us to change the way we study.

202
00:17:36,100 --> 00:17:37,980
She's crazy.

203
00:17:54,890 --> 00:17:57,190
Yes, this is Sin Dae Baek, Director.

204
00:18:00,180 --> 00:18:03,060
Yes, what made you call?

205
00:18:05,700 --> 00:18:09,240
Yes, I'm at Daechi Chase.

206
00:18:11,530 --> 00:18:12,900
Yes.

207
00:18:21,900 --> 00:18:26,670
I'm not sure if you should be calling about that.

208
00:18:29,550 --> 00:18:31,870
You said you'd convince them rationally.

209
00:18:31,870 --> 00:18:34,320
Look at you now.

210
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:37,870
Drink this.

211
00:18:41,340 --> 00:18:43,160
Thank you.

212
00:18:44,690 --> 00:18:48,210
Drink it and pull yourself together.

213
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:55,130
The fight here was nothing.

214
00:18:55,130 --> 00:18:56,940
I think it's...

215
00:18:58,070 --> 00:19:00,330
even worse outside the academy.

216
00:19:00,330 --> 00:19:05,440
Jeong Su takes notes thoroughly for a boy, and he pays attention in class.

217
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:06,470
Yes.

218
00:19:06,470 --> 00:19:08,910
But there's no sign of him studying.

219
00:19:08,910 --> 00:19:11,200
Same with Ye Eun.

220
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:13,000
Something's not right.

221
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:18,450
She used to give them tons of homework, mock tests, and handouts before.

222
00:19:18,450 --> 00:19:20,320
She said she won't check the homework, either.

223
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:23,480
Doesn't this mean she stopped caring for them?

224
00:19:23,480 --> 00:19:28,310
She doesn't check the homework. The TA does. Why?

225
00:19:33,160 --> 00:19:36,190
Can she not handle it physically?

226
00:19:36,190 --> 00:19:38,130
Because she's dating a younger man?

227
00:19:38,770 --> 00:19:40,800
Are you crazy?

228
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:44,800
You're talking about Seo Hye Jin, right?

229
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:46,270
Yes.

230
00:19:47,540 --> 00:19:49,710
Can we join you?

231
00:19:49,710 --> 00:19:52,240
Yes, go ahead.

232
00:20:04,100 --> 00:20:05,420
Are your kids starting 11th grade?

233
00:20:05,420 --> 00:20:07,150
Yes.

234
00:20:07,150 --> 00:20:08,800
Same with us.

235
00:20:10,810 --> 00:20:14,260
I don't think this should be taken lightly.

236
00:20:15,690 --> 00:20:19,130
You know the teacher who was her student? Lee Jun Ho?

237
00:20:19,130 --> 00:20:20,750
Yes.

238
00:20:20,750 --> 00:20:23,180
I heard he used to work for Cheongwun Group.

239
00:20:23,180 --> 00:20:25,640
What about that?

240
00:20:25,640 --> 00:20:29,850
She made her student quit his good job and join the academy.

241
00:20:29,850 --> 00:20:32,810
That's a serious thing to do.

242
00:20:35,420 --> 00:20:40,490
He was her only student when she first started working in Daechi-dong.

243
00:20:41,300 --> 00:20:45,380
She must've provided him with...

244
00:20:47,370 --> 00:20:50,430
an intense experience he couldn't forget.

245
00:20:51,830 --> 00:20:53,300
 Gosh... 

246
00:20:53,300 --> 00:20:56,180
- You're taking it too far. 
- I know.

247
00:20:56,820 --> 00:20:59,270
You must have a daughter.

248
00:20:59,270 --> 00:21:00,510
Yes.

249
00:21:00,510 --> 00:21:02,520
I know because I have a son.

250
00:21:02,520 --> 00:21:05,460
You have no idea

251
00:21:05,460 --> 00:21:08,500
how hot-blooded teenage boys are.

252
00:21:09,210 --> 00:21:12,900
- My gosh. No way. 
- If that's true...

253
00:21:12,900 --> 00:21:14,640
That's so gross.

254
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:16,420
What's gross? Huh?

255
00:21:16,420 --> 00:21:19,780
It all hit the fan. Have a seat.

256
00:21:19,780 --> 00:21:21,620
Seriously.

257
00:21:22,910 --> 00:21:26,020
 I know. They totally lost their minds. 

258
00:21:26,020 --> 00:21:29,730
They hang out in the classrooms every night.

259
00:21:29,730 --> 00:21:32,210
In the classrooms?

260
00:21:32,210 --> 00:21:33,880
Hello, Director.

261
00:21:33,880 --> 00:21:35,930
Director,

262
00:21:35,930 --> 00:21:37,630
this is amazing.

263
00:21:38,330 --> 00:21:43,680
Daechi Chase somehow has major problems as soon as Mr. Pyo joined us.

264
00:21:43,680 --> 00:21:46,770
Looks like you're having a very lucky year.

265
00:21:46,770 --> 00:21:48,460
I'm not sure what you're referring to.

266
00:21:48,460 --> 00:21:51,970
You know Seo Hye Jin? The one from the "Teacher-Pupil Tag Team."

267
00:21:51,970 --> 00:21:54,920
Yes, what about her?

268
00:21:56,680 --> 00:21:59,590
She's apparently

269
00:21:59,590 --> 00:22:01,530
intimately involved with her former student.

270
00:22:01,530 --> 00:22:03,750
Ever since he was in high school.

271
00:22:03,750 --> 00:22:05,400
Really?

272
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:08,410
It'd probably become a huge deal.

273
00:22:08,970 --> 00:22:10,850
Gosh, what a pity.

274
00:22:10,850 --> 00:22:12,460
What a shame.

275
00:22:12,460 --> 00:22:14,870
She's talented.

276
00:22:32,680 --> 00:22:34,930
Seo Hye Jin.

277
00:22:36,070 --> 00:22:38,400
What a shame.

278
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:43,360
Yes.

279
00:22:47,720 --> 00:22:49,540
You came in time, sir.

280
00:22:49,540 --> 00:22:54,630
Gosh, Director. I'm glad you're getting more and more successful.

281
00:22:54,630 --> 00:22:55,970
It's thanks to you.

282
00:22:55,970 --> 00:22:58,110
- Have a seat here.
 - Okay.

283
00:23:00,530 --> 00:23:05,770
We recommend this and this.

284
00:23:05,770 --> 00:23:09,610
There used to be academies in both spots.

285
00:23:09,610 --> 00:23:12,120
You'll save on the facilities...

286
00:23:12,120 --> 00:23:15,080
and it's close to the main location, too.

287
00:23:15,080 --> 00:23:19,490
The owner of this building just turned 30.

288
00:23:19,490 --> 00:23:22,410
He travels abroad for half a year.

289
00:23:22,410 --> 00:23:24,210
He's letting us manage it entirely.

290
00:23:24,210 --> 00:23:26,740
It'd be easier for you.

291
00:23:27,810 --> 00:23:30,220
Should I schedule a visit for you?

292
00:23:30,220 --> 00:23:32,090
Instead of that...

293
00:23:33,350 --> 00:23:36,840
there's a building I want to rent.

294
00:23:36,840 --> 00:23:39,500
Yes, please tell me.

295
00:23:39,500 --> 00:23:43,240
There's an academy called Daechi Chase on the major street.

296
00:23:43,240 --> 00:23:45,020
I know.

297
00:23:45,020 --> 00:23:48,650
Does that building have an empty unit?

298
00:23:48,650 --> 00:23:51,500
I think there will be soon.

299
00:23:52,820 --> 00:23:58,690
I want to use the floor they're using for lecture rooms.

300
00:23:58,690 --> 00:24:00,680
I'll look into it.

301
00:24:01,900 --> 00:24:04,060
Thank you.

302
00:24:20,600 --> 00:24:22,600
What's going on?

303
00:24:24,210 --> 00:24:26,950
Seonbae, check the messenger. The messenger.

304
00:24:26,950 --> 00:24:29,880
Aren't the ones who have a similar schedule to Team Leader Seo's screwed?

305
00:24:29,880 --> 00:24:33,350
Come on. You think she'd go down like this?

306
00:24:46,470 --> 00:24:48,230
Let's go out.

307
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:50,570
I'm okay.

308
00:24:51,850 --> 00:24:54,510
Don't make a spectacle of yourself.

309
00:24:54,510 --> 00:24:56,520
I did nothing wrong.

310
00:24:56,520 --> 00:24:58,580
I have no reason to run away, either.

311
00:25:05,290 --> 00:25:06,920
By the way,

312
00:25:07,950 --> 00:25:11,280
why are the director and assistant director quiet now?

313
00:25:12,710 --> 00:25:14,410
I know, huh?

314
00:25:21,800 --> 00:25:25,730
Why did you come all the way here so early?

315
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:35,380
Is it something you can't talk about at the academy?

316
00:25:37,810 --> 00:25:41,390
I ran here to kneel in front of you.

317
00:25:41,390 --> 00:25:44,300
Aigoo, come on.

318
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:58,600
I got about 500 calls this morning.

319
00:25:58,600 --> 00:26:01,350
I'm expecting about 5,000 more.

320
00:26:01,350 --> 00:26:05,500
You should fix things at the academy instead of doing this here.

321
00:26:06,300 --> 00:26:09,820
Beating around the bush would be a waste of time.

322
00:26:09,820 --> 00:26:12,000
So let me ask you directly.

323
00:26:12,900 --> 00:26:16,500
Just why are you doing this?

324
00:26:16,500 --> 00:26:18,580
Why am I doing this?

325
00:26:18,580 --> 00:26:20,930
I'm just trying to take what's mine.

326
00:26:20,930 --> 00:26:24,780
We've been getting along all this time.

327
00:26:24,780 --> 00:26:27,610
Have we? Really?

328
00:26:29,190 --> 00:26:32,890
We might've had disagreements

329
00:26:32,890 --> 00:26:36,800
about management and HR stuff,

330
00:26:36,800 --> 00:26:38,550
but we've been pretty democratic—

331
00:26:38,550 --> 00:26:41,260
Life is too long

332
00:26:41,260 --> 00:26:46,460
to live off the salary from the democratic Director Kim Hyeon Tak.

333
00:26:46,460 --> 00:26:51,860
If I'm unlucky, I might have to live longer than the years I've lived.

334
00:26:52,760 --> 00:26:56,480
Today, I'm the youngest I ever will be.

335
00:26:56,480 --> 00:27:00,410
I should try lighting a flame while I'm young.

336
00:27:00,410 --> 00:27:02,030
A flame...

337
00:27:02,650 --> 00:27:05,490
It'd be nice to light one together.

338
00:27:09,370 --> 00:27:12,410
If you tell me what you want...

339
00:27:16,100 --> 00:27:20,260
Would you give me everything if I told you?

340
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:25,400
Not everything, but...

341
00:27:25,400 --> 00:27:30,010
we can discuss what's best for both of us.

342
00:27:30,010 --> 00:27:33,470
It's meaningless unless it's everything. No.

343
00:27:33,470 --> 00:27:35,990
It won't be enough even if you give me everything.

344
00:27:35,990 --> 00:27:39,870
What I want is the academy I used to have.

345
00:27:39,870 --> 00:27:42,270
My goodness.

346
00:27:42,270 --> 00:27:45,710
Don't make it sound like I stole Victory from you.

347
00:27:45,710 --> 00:27:47,610
It was a win-win situation then.

348
00:27:47,610 --> 00:27:51,830
I'm sure I was the easiest prey to catch.

349
00:27:51,830 --> 00:27:55,260
Since I had totally run out of cash trying to expand the academy.

350
00:27:55,260 --> 00:27:56,720
Well...

351
00:27:56,720 --> 00:27:58,360
I did...

352
00:27:58,360 --> 00:28:02,400
buy it cheaply since I already had teachers,

353
00:28:02,400 --> 00:28:07,270
but by giving you the assistant director position and I provided enough—

354
00:28:09,930 --> 00:28:13,330
You think that was enough.

355
00:28:13,330 --> 00:28:16,120
That's why we can't make a deal.

356
00:28:17,020 --> 00:28:18,760
Please understand.

357
00:28:19,360 --> 00:28:22,170
Seo Hye Jin is about to lose all of her students.

358
00:28:22,170 --> 00:28:26,490
If the other teachers quit, too, I'll have to close next month.

359
00:28:26,490 --> 00:28:31,010
Turning over a new leaf,  it would be okay to have a fresh start.

360
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:38,010
I said we're the youngest we ever will be today.

361
00:28:41,090 --> 00:28:43,550
You can't do this.

362
00:28:46,410 --> 00:28:49,580
I understand you're very resentful toward me.

363
00:28:49,580 --> 00:28:52,850
But what did Seo Hye Jin do to deserve this?

364
00:28:52,850 --> 00:28:56,870
She can easily come back outside of this town since she's talented.

365
00:28:56,870 --> 00:28:59,520
- Assistant Director.
 - So...

366
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:03,800
I'll email you the resignation letter.

367
00:29:03,800 --> 00:29:06,830
But Assistant Director...

368
00:29:27,180 --> 00:29:28,930
Help me.

369
00:29:32,020 --> 00:29:33,830
Let me explain myself.

370
00:29:33,830 --> 00:29:37,300
The teachers need to stay where they are for now...

371
00:29:40,400 --> 00:29:42,800
Oh, I'm sorry.

372
00:29:42,800 --> 00:29:47,480
Makes me wonder how you lost your influence so easily like this.

373
00:29:49,970 --> 00:29:52,160
You need to let me last at least one semester—

374
00:29:52,160 --> 00:29:55,850
Why are you overreacting so much?

375
00:29:55,850 --> 00:29:57,540
This academy isn't yours.

376
00:29:57,540 --> 00:30:00,540
I wouldn't ask you if it were.

377
00:30:00,540 --> 00:30:03,230
What did Director Kim do to deserve this?

378
00:30:06,100 --> 00:30:08,800
The Assistant Director said...

379
00:30:08,800 --> 00:30:13,490
"You should've listened when I suggested making Seo Hye Jin powerless."

380
00:30:15,690 --> 00:30:17,840
She was right.

381
00:30:20,010 --> 00:30:22,550
That's the kind of person she is.

382
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:29,770
People's hidden emotions that are deeply buried.

383
00:30:29,770 --> 00:30:33,820
She can smell that stale stench instinctively.

384
00:30:33,820 --> 00:30:35,850
Director Kim's anxiety,

385
00:30:35,850 --> 00:30:38,050
Team Leader Lee's insecurity, and Gray Witch's greed.

386
00:30:38,050 --> 00:30:41,580
- She takes advantage of that, and you're also— 
- Wow.

387
00:30:43,250 --> 00:30:46,410
This is how people change when they're desperate.

388
00:30:46,410 --> 00:30:47,720
I can't believe you're speaking ill of other people.

389
00:30:47,720 --> 00:30:49,920
I'm not speaking ill of them.

390
00:30:55,140 --> 00:30:57,540
You need to know your place.

391
00:30:58,590 --> 00:31:02,280
I'm not the one who created a mess here. You did that

392
00:31:02,280 --> 00:31:04,540
because you went crazy over your old student.

393
00:31:09,220 --> 00:31:11,120
Answer the phone. Go ahead.

394
00:31:11,120 --> 00:31:15,070
You'd be better off explaining things to the parents instead.

395
00:31:22,810 --> 00:31:24,550
Yes, ma'am.

396
00:31:29,430 --> 00:31:33,840
Did you discuss this with Do Gyeom, too?

397
00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:37,200
The consultation for Chanyeong High...

398
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:39,970
is very backed up right now.

399
00:31:41,900 --> 00:31:45,190
We'll call you back if you leave us your phone number.

400
00:31:45,190 --> 00:31:46,140
Yes.

401
00:31:46,140 --> 00:31:49,550
It's not like that, ma'am.

402
00:31:49,550 --> 00:31:50,970
No, I mean...

403
00:31:50,970 --> 00:31:53,780
What do you mean, minor?

404
00:31:53,780 --> 00:31:55,310
Excuse me for a moment.

405
00:31:55,310 --> 00:31:56,850
Yes, this is Daechi— Yes, yes.

406
00:31:56,850 --> 00:31:58,760
Yes, just one moment.

407
00:31:58,760 --> 00:32:01,860
I'll call you back in a moment. I'm sorry.

408
00:32:01,860 --> 00:32:03,160
Yes, yes.

409
00:32:03,160 --> 00:32:05,270
Yes.

410
00:32:05,970 --> 00:32:10,540
No, we won't be able to have a consultation today.

411
00:32:11,520 --> 00:32:13,880
No, no. We aren't ignoring you.

412
00:32:13,880 --> 00:32:18,850
Both the consultation manager and Ms. Seo are unavailable.

413
00:32:34,990 --> 00:32:38,040
 You'll get covered in poop water. 

414
00:32:46,420 --> 00:32:49,180
Why are you out in the cold?

415
00:32:49,180 --> 00:32:52,850
Well... It just happened that way.

416
00:32:54,550 --> 00:32:58,360
You should be in agony somewhere warm.

417
00:32:58,360 --> 00:33:01,280
- I looked for you everywhere.
 - I'm not in agony.

418
00:33:01,280 --> 00:33:03,800
It was a fair point to bring up.

419
00:33:06,570 --> 00:33:09,050
Let's stop right here.

420
00:33:12,730 --> 00:33:14,260
What do you mean?

421
00:33:15,380 --> 00:33:19,570
Team Leader Seo is in big enough trouble with the rumor that spread outside.

422
00:33:19,570 --> 00:33:21,240
That's not my fault.

423
00:33:21,240 --> 00:33:23,650
Regardless of the source...

424
00:33:27,560 --> 00:33:29,270
It sounds like...

425
00:33:30,160 --> 00:33:35,300
someone else was in charge of spreading the rumor.

426
00:33:35,300 --> 00:33:38,580
Or maybe there's someone at the top?

427
00:33:38,580 --> 00:33:39,890
Is that true?

428
00:33:39,890 --> 00:33:42,820
I have a class. I'll go now.

429
00:33:42,820 --> 00:33:44,670
That person at the top—

430
00:33:44,670 --> 00:33:46,840
I have a class.

431
00:33:50,560 --> 00:33:52,280
Assistant Director?

432
00:33:52,280 --> 00:33:53,840
Is that right?

433
00:33:54,640 --> 00:33:58,330
And Lee Myeong Jun spread the rumor?

434
00:34:09,940 --> 00:34:13,900
Assistant Director Wu will make you an offer soon.

435
00:34:13,900 --> 00:34:17,280
You should think carefully, too. There's no hope here.

436
00:34:18,080 --> 00:34:22,250
Wow, all these trashy morons...

437
00:34:23,250 --> 00:34:26,580
What did you just say? Huh?

438
00:34:31,740 --> 00:34:34,070
Let's fix this.

439
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:39,470
Let's work together to help them and correct the rumor.

440
00:34:39,470 --> 00:34:42,250
- We can fix it.
 - What for?

441
00:34:43,140 --> 00:34:46,730
Think about how hurt Seo Hye Jin would be.

442
00:34:49,360 --> 00:34:51,140
Team Leader,

443
00:34:52,620 --> 00:34:54,600
you'll definitely...

444
00:34:55,300 --> 00:34:58,030
regret this someday.

445
00:34:58,960 --> 00:35:00,480
Yes.

446
00:35:01,030 --> 00:35:03,280
It's a pity.

447
00:35:09,540 --> 00:35:13,570
Just because their textbooks are clean, it doesn't mean they didn't study.

448
00:35:13,570 --> 00:35:17,740
I'm helping the students learn how to understand the text.

449
00:35:17,740 --> 00:35:22,120
We're wondering if you changed your teaching method too drastically.

450
00:35:22,120 --> 00:35:23,930
I'm worried about the progression of the class, too.

451
00:35:23,930 --> 00:35:28,620
I'm not sure if you could finish the curriculum you presented.

452
00:35:29,670 --> 00:35:33,200
Jeong Su is very good in Korean.

453
00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:37,670
I was so happy he got Grade 1 in the last finals.

454
00:35:37,670 --> 00:35:38,820
Oh, well...

455
00:35:38,820 --> 00:35:41,020
He did well in the mock test, too.

456
00:35:41,020 --> 00:35:42,800
Yes.

457
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:49,160
But I don't think he could maintain that score in 12th grade.

458
00:35:49,160 --> 00:35:51,440
- Pardon?
 - Oh, my.

459
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:52,940
How could you say something so cruel?

460
00:35:52,940 --> 00:35:54,720
I'm not cruel. I'm reflecting on my actions.

461
00:35:54,720 --> 00:35:56,920
It's because of how I've been teaching.

462
00:35:56,920 --> 00:35:59,340
The students will struggle with the new texts

463
00:35:59,340 --> 00:36:02,070
and get flustered when faced with unfamiliar examples.

464
00:36:02,070 --> 00:36:03,710
Ha Yul, Ye Eun,

465
00:36:03,710 --> 00:36:05,810
Jeong Su, Sang Hee, and Wu Ju.

466
00:36:05,810 --> 00:36:11,400
They'll gradually struggle with Korean as time passes.

467
00:36:11,400 --> 00:36:16,070
So, can you guarantee Grade 1 with this method?

468
00:36:17,010 --> 00:36:21,100
 But they demand that I raise their grades when they have no knowledge— 

469
00:36:21,100 --> 00:36:23,160
 Just say you will. 

470
00:36:23,160 --> 00:36:24,870
I...

471
00:36:26,100 --> 00:36:27,930
cannot guarantee it.

472
00:36:28,900 --> 00:36:31,920
Are you saying you'd experiment with the kids or something?

473
00:36:31,920 --> 00:36:34,270
I think I'm right,

474
00:36:34,270 --> 00:36:37,550
but I can't guarantee the results.

475
00:36:37,550 --> 00:36:40,050
Because studying is up to the students, not me.

476
00:36:40,050 --> 00:36:43,490
And they need to change completely to beat the students

477
00:36:43,490 --> 00:36:44,900
who were trained from a young age.

478
00:36:44,900 --> 00:36:50,040
Are you telling us that we didn't teach them right at home?

479
00:36:50,790 --> 00:36:56,230
You all discontinued subscriptions to the workbooks after they graduated elementary school, right?

480
00:36:56,230 --> 00:37:01,580
That's when you stopped reading with your children.

481
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:05,400
Practicing to read and write properly.

482
00:37:06,100 --> 00:37:09,530
You weren't able to help them with it, but I want to.

483
00:37:09,530 --> 00:37:13,140
I believe the grades will follow naturally.

484
00:37:20,130 --> 00:37:22,700
We've been treating you with respect,

485
00:37:22,700 --> 00:37:25,120
but you're walking all over us now.

486
00:37:25,120 --> 00:37:26,690
Ma'am.

487
00:37:27,360 --> 00:37:30,490
Because of your humiliating personal life,

488
00:37:30,490 --> 00:37:33,660
you no longer want to research or manage students.

489
00:37:33,660 --> 00:37:35,480
But you're blaming us?

490
00:37:35,480 --> 00:37:37,040
Ha Yul's mom.

491
00:37:37,040 --> 00:37:40,170
I think there's been a misunderstanding.

492
00:37:40,170 --> 00:37:43,410
Is that why you seduced a young student? Because you're so impressive?

493
00:37:43,410 --> 00:37:45,580
Aren't you ashamed in front of your students?

494
00:37:45,580 --> 00:37:50,070
I'm not sure what you heard, but it's not true.

495
00:37:50,070 --> 00:37:53,270
Are you saying you don't have a thing going on with your student?

496
00:37:57,070 --> 00:38:00,270
- Ha Yul's mom.
 - Ha Yul's mom.

497
00:38:04,850 --> 00:38:08,890
What would the kids learn from a teacher who's lost her head?

498
00:38:08,890 --> 00:38:11,300
I'll demand a refund immediately.

499
00:38:13,110 --> 00:38:14,820
Ha Yul's mom!

500
00:38:14,820 --> 00:38:17,520
- Ha Yul's mom!
 - Eonni!  Eonni!

501
00:39:02,560 --> 00:39:04,590
 Just one second. 

502
00:39:06,340 --> 00:39:08,120
 Okay. 

503
00:39:35,100 --> 00:39:37,410
Where's Mr. Lee?

504
00:39:38,310 --> 00:39:41,460
He was waiting for you, and he just went to his class.

505
00:39:41,460 --> 00:39:43,190
That's good.

506
00:39:43,190 --> 00:39:44,770
That's good.

507
00:39:44,770 --> 00:39:47,490
It's better that he doesn't see me like this.

508
00:41:13,600 --> 00:41:18,800
 Daechi Chase 

509
00:41:27,690 --> 00:41:31,640
 Resignation Letter 

510
00:41:38,880 --> 00:41:43,330
Train yourself to visualize the text whenever you read it.

511
00:41:43,330 --> 00:41:46,280
This technique doesn't only apply to literature, okay?

512
00:41:46,280 --> 00:41:49,030
Let's read the essay I handed out.

513
00:41:52,800 --> 00:41:56,140
"This is a common expression, but Chuncheon is a lakeside city.

514
00:41:56,140 --> 00:42:00,720
But Chuncheon has only had a lake in its center for less than 50 years."

515
00:42:00,720 --> 00:42:02,350
Mr. Lee.

516
00:42:04,360 --> 00:42:06,420
What? What is it?

517
00:42:06,420 --> 00:42:08,270
Focus.

518
00:42:08,270 --> 00:42:12,290
You'll cry after taking the Institute for Evaluation's mock exam.

519
00:42:12,290 --> 00:42:13,940
Let's start over.

520
00:42:13,940 --> 00:42:16,950
"In 1967, across the Shinyeong River's canyon where Bukhan River and

521
00:42:16,950 --> 00:42:19,270
Soyang River meet, Euiam Dam was built and—"

522
00:42:19,270 --> 00:42:20,820
Mr. Lee.

523
00:42:21,400 --> 00:42:23,940
Tell us about your first love.

524
00:42:26,340 --> 00:42:29,340
Mr. Lee, did you really go out with Ms. Seo when you were in high school?

525
00:42:29,340 --> 00:42:31,130
So sensational.

526
00:42:31,130 --> 00:42:33,520
What's wrong with you?

527
00:42:33,520 --> 00:42:35,380
What?

528
00:42:35,380 --> 00:42:37,420
Hey, Hong Ju Wan.

529
00:42:37,420 --> 00:42:40,050
- Yes.
 - Pack your bag and leave.

530
00:42:41,200 --> 00:42:44,450
- Pardon?
 - Go upstairs and get a refund.

531
00:42:44,450 --> 00:42:48,150
- Why?
 - What you said is considered sexual harassment.

532
00:42:48,150 --> 00:42:50,180
Apologize to your classmates and leave.

533
00:42:50,180 --> 00:42:51,610
Mr. Lee, I was just joking.

534
00:42:51,610 --> 00:42:53,430
- Lee Seon Wu and Kim Do Yun.
  - Yes. 

535
00:42:53,430 --> 00:42:55,320
I'm warning both of you.

536
00:42:56,020 --> 00:42:59,280
You're wrong about me.

537
00:42:59,280 --> 00:43:02,890
Did you think I'd get scared and flustered if you asked that?

538
00:43:02,890 --> 00:43:06,890
Did you think I'd beg you to take my class? Huh?

539
00:43:10,170 --> 00:43:12,560
Why are you still here?

540
00:43:12,560 --> 00:43:15,730
"The rivers became a lake and..."

541
00:43:17,960 --> 00:43:20,390
What a psycho.

542
00:43:42,180 --> 00:43:43,680
Yes.

543
00:43:47,420 --> 00:43:49,860
You must be shocked.

544
00:44:03,040 --> 00:44:06,380
I can't guarantee it'll be okay.

545
00:44:06,380 --> 00:44:11,260
I've never issued so many refunds since I started my job here.

546
00:44:11,260 --> 00:44:14,120
I turned my phone off.

547
00:44:15,920 --> 00:44:19,200
Manager, when will you open your academy?

548
00:44:19,200 --> 00:44:22,930
Come on. What are you suddenly talking about?

549
00:44:22,930 --> 00:44:26,080
Do something now that we're in this situation.

550
00:44:26,080 --> 00:44:27,430
And take me with you.

551
00:44:27,430 --> 00:44:29,910
I'm so nervous.

552
00:44:33,970 --> 00:44:38,570
The academy failing won't be a big deal to the teachers.

553
00:44:38,570 --> 00:44:41,170
There are tons of academies out there.

554
00:44:41,170 --> 00:44:45,200
They can still make a living by starting a study group or something.

555
00:44:45,200 --> 00:44:47,100
My goodness.

556
00:44:52,820 --> 00:44:57,460
I'm the most pitiful one in this academy.

557
00:44:59,170 --> 00:45:01,390
That's not true.

558
00:45:01,390 --> 00:45:03,900
There's still Seo Hye Jin.

559
00:45:09,530 --> 00:45:10,760
It's Seo Hye Jin.

560
00:45:10,760 --> 00:45:12,170
Hey, did you hear?

561
00:45:12,170 --> 00:45:14,150
Isn't it crazy?

562
00:45:17,530 --> 00:45:19,020
Ms. Seo,

563
00:45:19,020 --> 00:45:22,830
should I go in and start the test?

564
00:45:22,830 --> 00:45:24,170
You can come later.

565
00:45:24,170 --> 00:45:26,040
Thank you, Min Ji.

566
00:45:49,670 --> 00:45:54,360
 You heard, right? Your class was fully registered. 

567
00:45:54,360 --> 00:45:55,980
Yes.

568
00:45:55,980 --> 00:45:59,700
I should congratulate you. I'm happy for you.

569
00:46:00,910 --> 00:46:02,940
According to the consultation office,

570
00:46:02,940 --> 00:46:06,060
the number of registrations suddenly went up today.

571
00:46:06,060 --> 00:46:08,160
It must be one or the other.

572
00:46:08,160 --> 00:46:12,640
Either the top student in school or a popular student registered.

573
00:46:12,640 --> 00:46:17,150
A student like that is more effective than thousands of flyers.

574
00:46:17,150 --> 00:46:22,980
Now you'll get settled quickly once you run the class properly.

575
00:46:24,070 --> 00:46:27,160
I heard the rumor.

576
00:46:27,160 --> 00:46:28,970
What rumor?

577
00:46:30,340 --> 00:46:32,660
About Ms. Seo and Mr. Lee.

578
00:46:33,890 --> 00:46:36,240
I heard, too.

579
00:46:37,040 --> 00:46:41,140
Out of all students, I need you to take extra care of

580
00:46:41,140 --> 00:46:45,200
Seong Ha Yul and Lee Jeong Su.

581
00:46:45,200 --> 00:46:46,930
Their scores are the highest, and—

582
00:46:46,930 --> 00:46:49,430
I know those two.

583
00:46:49,430 --> 00:46:52,430
Ha Yul and Jeong Su?

584
00:46:52,430 --> 00:46:54,600
Seo Hye Jin and Lee Jun Ho.

585
00:47:03,960 --> 00:47:09,200
I know that you met Seo Hye Jin privately.

586
00:47:09,200 --> 00:47:11,550
But Lee Jun Ho, too?

587
00:47:11,550 --> 00:47:13,080
Yes.

588
00:47:14,030 --> 00:47:15,970
So?

589
00:47:16,870 --> 00:47:18,880
A lot of the rumors are false.

590
00:47:18,880 --> 00:47:20,710
They aren't like that.

591
00:47:20,710 --> 00:47:21,990
So?

592
00:47:21,990 --> 00:47:25,670
I don't feel good about the students who left due to the rumors.

593
00:47:25,670 --> 00:47:27,510
So?

594
00:47:28,520 --> 00:47:31,680
- Pardon?
 - Will you not teach the class?

595
00:47:38,250 --> 00:47:42,620
I worked at a school for 20 years, too.

596
00:47:42,620 --> 00:47:46,000
Almost as long as you, Assistant Director.

597
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:52,520
I know it's not easy to change your thought process or habits.

598
00:47:52,520 --> 00:47:54,260
But...

599
00:47:55,160 --> 00:48:01,190
wasn't your resignation letter processed almost a month ago?

600
00:48:01,190 --> 00:48:04,490
It's not because I used to be a school teacher—

601
00:48:04,490 --> 00:48:07,640
Ever since you joined our academy,

602
00:48:07,640 --> 00:48:10,640
a lot of good things happened to me.

603
00:48:11,220 --> 00:48:14,450
I'm thankful for it,

604
00:48:14,450 --> 00:48:19,080
and I think we just need to start working in harmony now.

605
00:48:19,080 --> 00:48:24,320
But if you keep doing this, it won't be good.

606
00:48:25,740 --> 00:48:27,800
I'm not sure what you mean.

607
00:48:28,730 --> 00:48:32,790
This isn't like schools,

608
00:48:32,790 --> 00:48:38,190
where you're supplied with new students every year.

609
00:48:38,190 --> 00:48:42,370
You weren't transferred here.

610
00:48:44,250 --> 00:48:46,280
What are you looking at?

611
00:48:46,280 --> 00:48:48,270
Mom.

612
00:48:48,270 --> 00:48:50,280
You're going to Choiseon Korean starting next week.

613
00:48:50,280 --> 00:48:51,940
I don't want to, Mom.

614
00:48:51,940 --> 00:48:53,210
Why not?

615
00:48:53,210 --> 00:48:56,400
I thought Mr. Pyo's free lecture wasn't bad.

616
00:48:56,400 --> 00:48:58,480
I like Ms. Seo.

617
00:48:58,480 --> 00:49:00,020
You can't go there. It's no good.

618
00:49:00,020 --> 00:49:01,300
Mom.

619
00:49:01,300 --> 00:49:02,980
Didn't you hear?

620
00:49:02,980 --> 00:49:06,810
Did you see it yourself? Did you see Ms. Seo and Mr. Lee together?

621
00:49:06,810 --> 00:49:08,910
Do I have to see?

622
00:49:08,910 --> 00:49:12,500
The learning atmosphere is so important. How are you...

623
00:49:12,500 --> 00:49:15,550
How are you supposed to learn at a place like that?

624
00:49:15,550 --> 00:49:17,100
Geez.

625
00:49:21,100 --> 00:49:24,800
You're dead if you don't do the homework by the next class.

626
00:49:24,800 --> 00:49:28,220
I might look like a cosmos, but I'm really strong.

627
00:49:28,220 --> 00:49:30,250
You're not a cosmos.

628
00:49:30,250 --> 00:49:32,940
Cho Ah, stop eating tanghulu.

629
00:49:32,940 --> 00:49:35,250
Okay.

630
00:49:35,250 --> 00:49:36,670
Thank you, Ms. Nam.

631
00:49:36,670 --> 00:49:39,020
Yes, see you.

632
00:49:53,650 --> 00:49:55,560
Did the class go well?

633
00:49:55,560 --> 00:49:57,180
Well, yes.

634
00:49:57,180 --> 00:49:59,140
I suppose.

635
00:49:59,140 --> 00:50:01,870
It must've been hard to focus because of the situation.

636
00:50:04,180 --> 00:50:06,340
What's going on, by the way?

637
00:50:06,340 --> 00:50:08,280
Not much.

638
00:50:08,280 --> 00:50:12,970
I was just curious what you'd do in the future.

639
00:50:15,230 --> 00:50:16,860
Did you...

640
00:50:17,660 --> 00:50:22,260
know something before the fight broke out earlier?

641
00:50:25,300 --> 00:50:28,290
I noticed you were very calm earlier.

642
00:50:28,290 --> 00:50:30,440
Same with the way you treated Lee Jun Ho.

643
00:50:35,520 --> 00:50:37,040
What?

644
00:50:38,620 --> 00:50:40,610
Well...

645
00:50:40,610 --> 00:50:42,970
I'm seeing you differently now.

646
00:50:43,670 --> 00:50:45,710
You seem pretty...

647
00:50:46,470 --> 00:50:49,030
competitive, Team Leader.

648
00:50:51,540 --> 00:50:55,720
I know you're being sarcastic, but I'll take it as a compliment.

649
00:50:55,720 --> 00:50:57,570
So?

650
00:50:57,570 --> 00:51:00,370
I'm curious about what you know already.

651
00:51:00,370 --> 00:51:04,030
I knew Team Leader Seo and Mr. Lee were dating.

652
00:51:04,030 --> 00:51:07,500
I also know their relationship isn't scandalous, as they say.

653
00:51:09,180 --> 00:51:10,380
You knew everything?

654
00:51:10,380 --> 00:51:14,220
I know Assistant Director Wu started everything today, too.

655
00:51:16,010 --> 00:51:18,930
Do you work for the NIS? You know everything.

656
00:51:21,150 --> 00:51:22,960
If so...

657
00:51:23,980 --> 00:51:26,300
did the Assistant Director propose something?

658
00:51:27,480 --> 00:51:31,750
Aren't we usually supposed to share information?

659
00:51:31,750 --> 00:51:33,980
Am I the only one who speaks?

660
00:51:37,320 --> 00:51:39,540
I'm sorry. I have nothing to share.

661
00:51:39,540 --> 00:51:43,060
I just found out about Seo Hye Jin and Lee Jun Ho yesterday, too.

662
00:51:52,290 --> 00:51:53,810
Fine.

663
00:51:54,840 --> 00:51:57,090
I'll leave, then.

664
00:51:57,090 --> 00:51:59,140
I'll let you finish up.

665
00:51:59,140 --> 00:52:00,650
Okay.

666
00:52:40,030 --> 00:52:42,520
Are you done with your class?

667
00:52:42,520 --> 00:52:44,010
Yes.

668
00:52:53,110 --> 00:52:55,650
The lecture room is too big.

669
00:52:57,870 --> 00:53:02,750
There were 13 students in this big room today.

670
00:53:04,450 --> 00:53:10,860
Ten of them were staring at my face instead of the blackboard the entire class.

671
00:53:12,040 --> 00:53:16,930
They stared as if I were a celebrity in a scandal.

672
00:54:25,390 --> 00:54:27,940
He's a crazy bastard.

673
00:54:29,010 --> 00:54:30,960
What?

674
00:54:30,960 --> 00:54:34,760
Have a look yourself if you're curious. I think he wants us to see it.

675
00:54:39,610 --> 00:54:41,950
Run away, Ms. Nam.

676
00:54:43,750 --> 00:54:48,090
I know you're a great teacher, better than anyone else,

677
00:54:48,890 --> 00:54:51,610
but you'll still be affected.

678
00:54:52,260 --> 00:54:57,100
It might be difficult to keep the class you worked so hard to start.

679
00:54:58,560 --> 00:55:01,380
I considered it, too...

680
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:06,270
but I can't because it sucks.

681
00:55:08,350 --> 00:55:11,550
You took the hint, right?

682
00:55:13,180 --> 00:55:17,380
I don't own that much yet.

683
00:55:18,180 --> 00:55:22,180
I have no one to trust but myself.

684
00:55:22,180 --> 00:55:25,340
So, I live off of self-esteem and confidence.

685
00:55:25,340 --> 00:55:27,520
That's your charm.

686
00:55:29,970 --> 00:55:32,890
That's why I won't join the gang.

687
00:55:35,800 --> 00:55:38,010
I'll keep you entertained.

688
00:55:40,870 --> 00:55:42,590
I'm sorry.

689
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:01,820
Where's Mr. Lee?

690
00:56:02,470 --> 00:56:04,240
I wonder.

691
00:56:25,130 --> 00:56:28,140
 I'm leaving because something urgent came up. 

692
00:56:28,140 --> 00:56:30,350
 I wanted to stay with you tonight 

693
00:56:30,350 --> 00:56:33,110
 but I can't say no to this person. 

694
00:56:33,110 --> 00:56:35,370
 Don't skip dinner. 

695
00:56:35,370 --> 00:56:37,000
 I love you. 

696
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:38,890
 I'll call you. 

697
00:56:43,970 --> 00:56:46,890
Mr. Lee is protesting right now.

698
00:56:56,170 --> 00:56:58,030
I'm curious.

699
00:57:12,970 --> 00:57:17,890
Mr. Lee is a difficult person to control.

700
00:57:17,890 --> 00:57:20,700
He left this for everyone to see.

701
00:57:36,870 --> 00:57:39,790
You don't need me to entertain you tonight, right?

702
00:57:39,790 --> 00:57:42,460
Mr. Lee said he'd call you.

703
00:57:42,460 --> 00:57:44,490
I need to be somewhere.

704
00:57:49,020 --> 00:57:50,750
Bye.

705
00:58:05,940 --> 00:58:08,500
Did the class go well today?

706
00:58:10,050 --> 00:58:11,470
Yes.

707
00:58:11,470 --> 00:58:13,280
Same with Hye Jin?

708
00:58:20,720 --> 00:58:22,920
You know what?

709
00:58:22,920 --> 00:58:25,150
When you said you'd join the academy,

710
00:58:25,150 --> 00:58:28,520
Seo Hye Jin opposed it passionately.

711
00:58:29,530 --> 00:58:31,850
Yes, I know.

712
00:58:33,150 --> 00:58:36,280
I should've listened to her, then.

713
00:58:36,870 --> 00:58:42,190
I always gain something good when I listen to Seo Hye Jin.

714
00:58:51,100 --> 00:58:52,760
Thank you.

715
00:58:52,760 --> 00:58:55,810
You look so exhausted.

716
00:58:57,700 --> 00:58:59,650
Is it because of the lighting?

717
00:58:59,650 --> 00:59:01,090
I'm fine.

718
00:59:01,090 --> 00:59:03,560
Lucky you. I wish I were fine.

719
00:59:40,120 --> 00:59:42,240
♫  To catch fish  ♫

720
00:59:42,240 --> 00:59:47,430
♫  I'm a romantic cat  ♫

721
00:59:47,430 --> 00:59:49,040
What's this?

722
00:59:49,040 --> 00:59:53,660
♫  A small light that's lighting up the sad city  ♫

723
00:59:53,660 --> 00:59:59,400
♫  I'm a romantic cat  ♫

724
00:59:59,400 --> 01:00:07,300
♫  My deep and sad sea that left me all alone  ♫

725
01:00:11,140 --> 01:00:13,270
Why aren't you singing?

726
01:00:18,320 --> 01:00:21,130
Was I mistaken?

727
01:00:21,130 --> 01:00:25,470
I thought teachers didn't strain their voices like that.

728
01:00:25,470 --> 01:00:27,430
We don't.

729
01:00:27,430 --> 01:00:28,970
But?

730
01:00:33,870 --> 01:00:35,800
Is something going on?

731
01:00:39,280 --> 01:00:41,550
It's a mess.

732
01:00:42,210 --> 01:00:43,640
I told you, right?

733
01:00:43,640 --> 01:00:48,110
That the hyenas will go after Mr. Lee and Team Leader Seo.

734
01:00:48,110 --> 01:00:52,680
What does that have to do with you singing at the top of your lungs?

735
01:00:53,660 --> 01:00:56,470
I decided not to join them.

736
01:00:58,310 --> 01:01:01,470
That makes me feel relieved, and...

737
01:01:02,110 --> 01:01:05,400
You're feeling proud of yourself, too?

738
01:01:09,440 --> 01:01:14,120
Doing that made me think of you.

739
01:01:19,640 --> 01:01:25,460
I thought it was silly to waste energy on love and relationships.

740
01:01:29,150 --> 01:01:31,130
But not anymore?

741
01:01:32,210 --> 01:01:37,100
Seeing Team Leader Seo,

742
01:01:37,100 --> 01:01:40,900
I thought it might be the opposite.

743
01:01:47,190 --> 01:01:48,970
Let's leave.

744
01:01:50,270 --> 01:01:52,910
- We have ten minutes left.
 - Geez...

745
01:01:52,910 --> 01:01:57,460
Grab your stuff unless you want me to confess my feelings under these lights.

746
01:01:58,780 --> 01:02:00,830
I don't care, though.

747
01:02:03,030 --> 01:02:05,440
- Really?
 - Yes.

748
01:02:05,440 --> 01:02:08,480
I care more about substance than style.

749
01:02:21,740 --> 01:02:23,900
I like you.

750
01:02:24,650 --> 01:02:26,390
You're cool.

751
01:02:26,390 --> 01:02:27,900
I want to...

752
01:02:28,750 --> 01:02:31,320
know more about you.

753
01:02:35,510 --> 01:02:38,740
It'd be hard for me to go on proper dates.

754
01:02:38,740 --> 01:02:41,110
I'll be off work late at night

755
01:02:41,110 --> 01:02:43,670
and no theme park on the weekend, either.

756
01:02:44,470 --> 01:02:49,130
I can't hang out with you if I teach for 10 hours a day.

757
01:02:51,830 --> 01:02:54,210
I said I'm good at entertaining myself.

758
01:03:24,750 --> 01:03:27,070
I haven't eaten all day.

759
01:03:51,040 --> 01:03:53,240
I've been...

760
01:03:53,240 --> 01:03:56,370
thinking about all sorts of things.

761
01:04:03,250 --> 01:04:07,780
What if you quit the academy?

762
01:04:17,480 --> 01:04:19,240
If I did...

763
01:04:20,410 --> 01:04:23,400
wouldn't it be proving the rumors right?

764
01:04:24,970 --> 01:04:28,230
Yun Ji Seok has a good reputation amongst teachers.

765
01:04:28,230 --> 01:04:30,800
He's influential, too.

766
01:04:30,800 --> 01:04:35,900
I think it might be able to calm them down for now.

767
01:04:35,900 --> 01:04:42,170
And I think I need to show them that I'm enraged about what happened, too.

768
01:04:43,550 --> 01:04:45,270
I hate to say this,

769
01:04:45,270 --> 01:04:49,900
but to make it work, I need to let go of Hye Jin.

770
01:04:51,390 --> 01:04:54,960
Don't look at me like that. I won't go that far.

771
01:04:55,890 --> 01:05:00,380
It's not like she can do anything else now.

772
01:05:02,360 --> 01:05:05,870
I'm the one who made her commit. I can't do that.

773
01:05:05,870 --> 01:05:11,410
I got her a car, paid her brother's tuition, and gave her bonuses.

774
01:05:11,410 --> 01:05:14,280
I made her delay going back to school.

775
01:05:14,280 --> 01:05:18,480
And I let her miss her last chance to take the bar exam.

776
01:05:22,620 --> 01:05:25,070
 Administrative Law 

777
01:05:27,690 --> 01:05:32,080
But you can go anywhere, Jun Ho.

778
01:05:32,780 --> 01:05:34,490
You can join a major academy, too.

779
01:05:34,490 --> 01:05:37,960
You can join a corporation if you want to.

780
01:05:37,960 --> 01:05:39,870
Or you can take a break, too.

781
01:05:39,870 --> 01:05:42,480
Your parents are well-off.

782
01:05:46,680 --> 01:05:51,070
The whole neighborhood is throwing rocks at you, but now you're telling me to—

783
01:05:51,070 --> 01:05:53,690
I'm trying to calm those people down.

784
01:05:53,690 --> 01:05:55,270
For Hye Jin's sake—

785
01:05:55,270 --> 01:05:56,980
I don't want to.

786
01:05:58,360 --> 01:06:01,390
I'll join a bigger academy someday,

787
01:06:01,390 --> 01:06:03,350
but not now.

788
01:06:04,840 --> 01:06:06,940
Aigoo...

789
01:06:09,840 --> 01:06:12,890
I know you're that kind of a person.

790
01:06:13,510 --> 01:06:17,750
You weren't ashamed to show your report card that said "Rank 8."

791
01:06:19,680 --> 01:06:23,780
You weren't discouraged after quitting that impressive job, either.

792
01:06:23,780 --> 01:06:27,460
- You probably don't fear anything in the world, but— 
 - No.

793
01:06:31,310 --> 01:06:33,170
I am afraid.

794
01:06:36,060 --> 01:06:39,440
I've never been so afraid in my whole life as I am today.

795
01:06:39,440 --> 01:06:41,280
What do you mean...

796
01:06:43,600 --> 01:06:48,670
♫  I can remember when   ♫

797
01:06:48,670 --> 01:06:52,970
♫  I was a child  ♫

798
01:06:53,790 --> 01:06:55,880
♫  And things were simple then  ♫

799
01:06:55,880 --> 01:06:57,630
Wait...

800
01:06:59,000 --> 01:07:02,490
♫  And I ran wild  ♫

801
01:07:02,490 --> 01:07:04,040
Her...

802
01:07:04,040 --> 01:07:09,220
♫  Can you remember when we first met, I  ♫

803
01:07:10,560 --> 01:07:14,220
Her life's work was ruined all at once.

804
01:07:14,220 --> 01:07:20,620
♫  It seemed that time did bend, and things were...  ♫

805
01:07:20,620 --> 01:07:23,390
My goodness...

806
01:07:23,390 --> 01:07:28,230
The academy that was so dear to me is about to crash.

807
01:07:29,090 --> 01:07:31,450
Yeah, I know...

808
01:07:31,450 --> 01:07:34,760
♫  Since I loved you  ♫

809
01:07:37,670 --> 01:07:42,230
I tried to come up with a solution, but I kept getting distracted.

810
01:07:48,710 --> 01:07:51,340
Maybe I shouldn't have come here.

811
01:07:52,410 --> 01:07:55,130
Maybe I should've been nicer to people around me.

812
01:07:55,130 --> 01:07:57,060
No...

813
01:07:57,060 --> 01:07:58,970
What I'm saying is, no...

814
01:07:58,970 --> 01:08:00,880
I also...

815
01:08:02,130 --> 01:08:05,390
tried to come up with a solution and...

816
01:08:08,650 --> 01:08:14,430
I'm a moron who only thought about living a good life on my own.

817
01:08:15,720 --> 01:08:18,110
I'm so scared right now.

818
01:08:21,560 --> 01:08:23,830
Mr. Lee.

819
01:08:26,430 --> 01:08:28,960
Calm down. Are you okay?

820
01:08:39,030 --> 01:08:48,920


821
01:09:08,360 --> 01:09:12,380
 The Midnight Romance 

822
01:09:12,380 --> 01:09:13,960
 I'm unbelievably humiliated by everything. 

823
01:09:13,960 --> 01:09:16,450
 You cried your eyes out. Why would you say that to me? 

824
01:09:16,450 --> 01:09:18,560
 What if I weren't your teacher? 

825
01:09:18,560 --> 01:09:20,470
 A rumor like this wouldn't have started, right? 

826
01:09:20,470 --> 01:09:24,120
 I don't discuss with anyone anything regarding management. 

827
01:09:24,120 --> 01:09:26,780
 Where's everyone? The culprits who started this. 

828
01:09:26,780 --> 01:09:28,540
 You really don't know? 

829
01:09:28,540 --> 01:09:30,840
 I think he'd suggest something. 

830
01:09:30,840 --> 01:09:33,650
 Get your act together. Don't ruin yourself further. 

831
01:09:33,650 --> 01:09:35,220
 Who's the one ruining himself right now? 

832
01:09:35,220 --> 01:09:37,060
 Are you out of your mind? 

833
01:09:37,060 --> 01:09:40,770
 Give me the shiny diploma now.
