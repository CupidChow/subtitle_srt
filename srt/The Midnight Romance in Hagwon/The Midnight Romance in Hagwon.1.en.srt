to make the first class grade.

9
00:00:51,219 --> 00:00:53,149
As you know, ma'am,

10
00:00:53,389 --> 00:00:55,920
Korean isn't the subject it used to be.

11
00:00:56,120 --> 00:00:57,989
The level of difficulty went way up...

12
00:00:57,990 --> 00:00:59,230
I say that because I know.

13
00:01:02,329 --> 00:01:05,369
Ji Woo's taking the advanced class,

14
00:01:05,370 --> 00:01:08,300
and she managed to keep up.

15
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,270
She's a hard worker.

16
00:01:12,169 --> 00:01:14,239
She's improving evenly in grammar,

17
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:15,338

18
00:01:15,339 --> 00:01:16,780
Can you bring her grade up to first class?

19
00:01:19,709 --> 00:01:23,318
Ji Woo's textbook is of average difficulty...

20
00:01:23,319 --> 00:01:24,949
The questions are pretty hard.

21
00:01:25,619 --> 00:01:28,720
The Daechi-dong girls' high schools teach at a high level,

22
00:01:28,819 --> 00:01:31,830
so the teachers try to set questions to evaluate the students.

23
00:01:32,429 --> 00:01:33,459
I went through them.

24
00:01:33,959 --> 00:01:35,799
A lot of passages weren't from the textbook.

25
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:37,868
We handed out a new textbook...

26
00:01:37,869 --> 00:01:39,928
to familiarize the students with various styles...

27
00:01:39,929 --> 00:01:41,940
The textbook wasn't for free.

28
00:01:43,240 --> 00:01:44,270
Well...

29
00:01:44,539 --> 00:01:46,669
She gets flustered when she comes across something new.

30
00:01:47,539 --> 00:01:50,110
Should I get her to read in her free time?

31
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:52,580
She's working on her writing skills.

32
00:01:53,410 --> 00:01:55,319
A good reading habit is important.

33
00:01:55,419 --> 00:01:58,288
We have a recommended reading list.

34
00:01:58,289 --> 00:01:59,449

35
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:02,589
No.

37
00:02:04,830 --> 00:02:05,830

40
00:02:13,169 --> 00:02:15,999
Every parent is different, but most of them...

41
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,940
ask those basic questions.

42
00:02:18,410 --> 00:02:21,009
This was a simulation, so shall I ask again?

43
00:02:21,739 --> 00:02:24,448
Reading is no longer noted in student records,

44
00:02:24,449 --> 00:02:27,380
but you would suggest the student read more books?

45
00:02:30,250 --> 00:02:32,049
You're not trying to be a great teacher, are you?

46
00:02:33,350 --> 00:02:34,889
But Ms. Seo...

47
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:37,689
Helping them adapt to various styles and passages...

48
00:02:37,690 --> 00:02:40,030
What if none of the passages are from the books you recommended?

49
00:02:42,060 --> 00:02:44,828
Parents want me to improve the grade...

50
00:02:44,829 --> 00:02:46,929
of a student who lacks basic knowledge and...

51
00:02:46,930 --> 00:02:48,569
You say you'll do it.

52
00:02:51,470 --> 00:02:54,710
Consulting is a hundred times harder than teaching a class.

53
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:57,340
Give me an example question.

54
00:02:57,810 --> 00:02:58,810
A hard one.

55
00:03:02,620 --> 00:03:05,190
It's best to strike fear in the parent.

56
00:03:05,690 --> 00:03:07,988
A tough passage, complicated options,

57
00:03:07,989 --> 00:03:09,358
and a long web of paragraphs.

58
00:03:09,359 --> 00:03:12,060
If the secret to acing it all and getting a good grade...

59
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:15,329
were common knowledge and reading, we wouldn't be needed.

60
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:16,660

61
00:03:17,359 --> 00:03:20,669

they could do with more intense tutoring.

118

I researched what they teach as best I could,

119
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:03,159

00:10:24,119 --> 00:10:25,229
Are you okay with that?

187
00:10:25,460 --> 00:10:27,830
I'm going to change my questions.

188
00:10:28,359 --> 00:10:29,359
What?

189
00:10:29,830 --> 00:10:31,600
People are asking for tips.

190
00:10:32,529 --> 00:10:34,129
- Tips? - Yes.

191
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:36,868
It's a small world and there's a network of teachers,

192
00:10:36,869 --> 00:10:38,569
and they're asking around...

193
00:10:38,570 --> 00:10:40,040
if anyone has sample questions.

194
00:10:40,739 --> 00:10:42,079
So you changed your section...

195
00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:43,680
while helping students with their exams for a month?

196
00:10:43,879 --> 00:10:45,878
Why bother when it's all down to...

197
00:10:45,879 --> 00:10:46,879
the test lecture?

198
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:48,319
It's best to be fair.

199
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:49,979
I don't want trouble down the line.

200
00:10:52,190 --> 00:10:53,749
Am I late?

201
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:54,989
Hello, sir.

202
00:10:57,989 --> 00:11:01,388
Are you looking over the exams you set for the new hires?

203
00:11:01,389 --> 00:11:04,258
They'll be printed tomorrow.

204
00:11:04,259 --> 00:11:06,170
I'll keep the sealed exam papers.

205
00:11:07,399 --> 00:11:08,499
What about the test lecture?

206
00:11:08,700 --> 00:11:11,169
We'll figure out a schedule for candidates for each subject...

207
00:11:11,170 --> 00:11:12,809
who passed the written exam,

208
00:11:12,810 --> 00:11:14,269
and they'll have 20 minutes each.

209
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:16,479
Twenty minutes.

210
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:18,149
Let's make it shorter.

211
00:11:19,850 --> 00:11:21,749
Ten minutes should do.

212
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:23,879
You can tell...

213
00:11:24,149 --> 00:11:26,749
after the first three minutes...

214
00:11:27,519 --> 00:11:29,920
who will become a future leader.

215
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:39,070
I thought long and hard.

216
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:41,999
Student numbers are declining,

217
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:44,440
and there are academies at each corner.

218
00:11:45,170 --> 00:11:47,170
In this fierce competition,

219
00:11:47,310 --> 00:11:49,580
what weapon should we use?

220
00:11:49,879 --> 00:11:51,609
Where does our future lie?

221
00:11:56,149 --> 00:11:58,720
However many times I wonder, I come to just one conclusion.

222
00:11:59,619 --> 00:12:01,859
The assets of this academy are you.

223
00:12:02,220 --> 00:12:03,420
The teachers.

224
00:12:05,060 --> 00:12:06,389
The university entrance exam...

225
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:09,600
is the first experience for a student and their parents...

226
00:12:09,830 --> 00:12:11,259
where their class is divided.

227
00:12:11,869 --> 00:12:13,029
You teachers...

228
00:12:14,869 --> 00:12:17,170
must be like the North Star.

229
00:12:18,409 --> 00:12:20,840
Mr. Lee, what must you be like?

230
00:12:21,540 --> 00:12:22,540
The North Star.

231
00:12:24,040 --> 00:12:27,279
The students' love for you and the parents' trust for you...

232
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:30,479
must never waver as you...

233
00:12:30,649 --> 00:12:32,119
shine down on them.

234
00:12:33,190 --> 00:12:34,190
Teaching skills?

235
00:12:35,119 --> 00:12:37,118
That can be taught.

236
00:12:37,119 --> 00:12:39,889
What I'm waiting for is an inherent charm.

237
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:43,659
Naturally born that can't be taught or trained.

238
00:12:43,999 --> 00:12:45,070
A natural strength.

239
00:12:45,999 --> 00:12:48,998
There are people who think of and work on...

240
00:12:48,999 --> 00:12:51,769
their strengths and charms and bring it out.

241
00:12:52,269 --> 00:12:55,810
I'll find those with that extraordinary sense.

242
00:12:59,080 --> 00:13:01,748
I'm facing a huge challenge...

243
00:13:01,749 --> 00:13:03,979
by opening an academy in north Seoul,

244
00:13:04,050 --> 00:13:05,450
and this important event...

245
00:13:06,590 --> 00:13:08,359
- Excuse me. - What is it?

246
00:13:08,790 --> 00:13:11,060
We need Ms. Seo.

247
00:13:12,790 --> 00:13:14,129
Ha Yul's crying.

248
00:13:14,389 --> 00:13:16,259
Ha Yul? She's crying?

249
00:13:16,629 --> 00:13:17,700
Excuse me.

250
00:13:25,269 --> 00:13:26,369
What could it be?

251
00:13:26,670 --> 00:13:29,009
Why cry when her exams are over? Did she make a mistake?

252
00:13:29,710 --> 00:13:30,839
I don't know.

253
00:13:30,840 --> 00:13:32,649
I asked, but she won't answer.

254
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:36,680
Ha Yul.

255
00:13:37,450 --> 00:13:39,989
Ha Yul. What's wrong?

256
00:13:40,550 --> 00:13:41,590
Sit up.

257
00:13:43,759 --> 00:13:46,830
It's okay, Ha Yul. Look at me.

258
00:13:47,359 --> 00:13:48,560
Did you make a mistake?

259
00:13:48,930 --> 00:13:50,359
It's not that.

260
00:13:54,700 --> 00:13:55,700
Here.

261
00:13:57,100 --> 00:13:58,639
Number 11.

262
00:14:00,909 --> 00:14:03,440
(We gradually get excited.)

263
00:14:06,950 --> 00:14:08,420
The answer is number five?

264
00:14:10,779 --> 00:14:11,889
Did you pick number two?

265
00:14:13,050 --> 00:14:14,050
Yes.

266
00:14:14,290 --> 00:14:15,359
This question.

267
00:14:15,960 --> 00:14:17,619
Can you explain to me...

268
00:14:18,119 --> 00:14:19,229
why you chose number two?

269
00:14:19,690 --> 00:14:21,999
- "We gradually get excited." - Yes.

270
00:14:23,859 --> 00:14:25,999
The speaker is a poor farmer.

271
00:14:27,070 --> 00:14:29,200
He sold an ox to make ends meet.

272
00:14:29,499 --> 00:14:30,540
Right.

273
00:14:31,100 --> 00:14:33,769
And he said he got excited.

274
00:14:33,909 --> 00:14:35,040
What did you take that as?

275
00:14:36,080 --> 00:14:37,310
Irony.

276
00:14:37,479 --> 00:14:38,580
You're right.

277
00:14:39,149 --> 00:14:42,279
Like how Kim So Wol's poem says he forgot his loved one.

278
00:14:45,090 --> 00:14:46,690
It's okay. You didn't mess up.

279
00:14:46,989 --> 00:14:49,090
You'd have felt confused even if you'd read all the options.

280
00:14:52,090 --> 00:14:53,330
Could you do what you just did...

281
00:14:54,330 --> 00:14:56,429
and share your opinion with your school teacher?

282
00:14:56,430 --> 00:14:57,499
Me?

283
00:15:00,330 --> 00:15:02,540
I'm scared. I don't want to.

284
00:15:03,340 --> 00:15:05,340
What if he puts it in my student record?

285
00:15:06,670 --> 00:15:09,440
Your exam just ended today.

286
00:15:10,139 --> 00:15:12,950
You know your grades can be adjusted until they're announced, right?

287
00:15:14,310 --> 00:15:15,320
Yes.

288
00:15:25,129 --> 00:15:26,729
- Ha Yul. - Mom.

289
00:15:26,930 --> 00:15:27,960
Good job.

290
00:15:29,659 --> 00:15:30,729
You didn't read your texts.

291
00:15:30,999 --> 00:15:33,430
I was in the study hall. My phone was on silent.

292
00:15:34,570 --> 00:15:35,570
Good for you.

293
00:15:36,670 --> 00:15:38,509
You must be hungry. Let's go.

294
00:15:40,210 --> 00:15:42,310
It was a bit suffocating when I first moved here.

295
00:15:42,810 --> 00:15:44,279
I got used to it now.

296
00:15:45,550 --> 00:15:48,680
Let's hang in there a bit longer and then get out of here.

297
00:15:49,720 --> 00:15:52,249
Your dad's having a rough time at work too.

298
00:15:53,749 --> 00:15:55,119
It's all up to you, Ha Yul.

299
00:15:55,889 --> 00:15:57,460
I pray a lot, you know.

300
00:16:01,590 --> 00:16:03,129
Is Dad at home?

301
00:16:03,800 --> 00:16:04,930
Of course.

302
00:16:06,999 --> 00:16:07,999
What's wrong?

303
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:10,139
What's the matter?

304
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:13,340
Ha Yul. Hey.

305
00:16:14,040 --> 00:16:16,279
What's wrong? Did something bad happen?

306
00:16:16,810 --> 00:16:17,810
What is it?

307
00:16:18,950 --> 00:16:20,180
What's going on?

308
00:16:20,580 --> 00:16:22,920
(Ha Yul's mother)

309
00:16:30,159 --> 00:16:31,190
Hello?

310
00:16:31,989 --> 00:16:33,889
Ha Yul told me what happened.

311
00:16:34,290 --> 00:16:35,899
Are you sure about what you said?

312
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:38,359
Are there two possible answers?

313
00:16:39,499 --> 00:16:41,570
Yes. We expected this passage would come up.

314
00:16:43,670 --> 00:16:45,639
Yes, the student should make the objection.

315
00:16:45,810 --> 00:16:47,070
It's only right to ask.

316
00:16:49,840 --> 00:16:50,979
There won't be a disadvantage.

317
00:16:51,580 --> 00:16:53,210
I'll talk about it with her.

318
00:17:17,199 --> 00:17:19,639
Hey. It's Ha Yul's mom.

319
00:17:20,439 --> 00:17:21,570
Have you heard?

320
00:17:22,510 --> 00:17:24,009
When I asked yesterday,

321
00:17:24,010 --> 00:17:25,980
Ha Yul had a good understanding.

322
00:17:26,709 --> 00:17:28,310
I want her to get the extra points,

323
00:17:28,580 --> 00:17:30,819
but I don't want her to object, still get it wrong,

324
00:17:30,820 --> 00:17:32,189
and get on the teacher's bad side.

325
00:17:32,719 --> 00:17:33,990
It's killing me.

326
00:17:34,949 --> 00:17:36,919
I've known Ha Yul for a long time.

327
00:17:37,090 --> 00:17:38,490
She's calm and she'll do fine.

328
00:17:38,790 --> 00:17:41,589
The other moms told me not to make a big deal...

329
00:17:41,590 --> 00:17:43,199
of it for the kid's sake.

330
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:46,929
I'm not sure if we should let the kids handle it.

331
00:17:47,770 --> 00:17:50,669
Her teacher will listen if she speaks politely.

332
00:17:50,869 --> 00:17:52,840
Trust in the kids and the teacher.

333
00:17:56,179 --> 00:17:57,810
How can we do that?

334
00:18:00,379 --> 00:18:01,879
I'm done for, Mom.

335
00:18:03,219 --> 00:18:04,250
Didn't you hear me?

336
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:06,090
Is that what your academy teacher said?

337
00:18:11,060 --> 00:18:12,560
I just thought...

338
00:18:14,830 --> 00:18:16,829
the farmer feeling excited was...

339
00:18:16,830 --> 00:18:18,359
I explained many times.

340
00:18:19,469 --> 00:18:21,770
It's logically contradictory, so it's paradoxical.

341
00:18:26,270 --> 00:18:27,270
What?

342
00:18:28,510 --> 00:18:29,580
Sung Ha Yul.

343
00:18:32,949 --> 00:18:35,010
- But... - But what?

344
00:18:39,750 --> 00:18:41,090
Do you have more to say?

345
00:18:44,219 --> 00:18:45,260
You can go.

346
00:18:47,060 --> 00:18:48,189
Shouldn't you bow?

347
00:18:57,369 --> 00:18:59,740
I feel so bad for Ha Yul.

348
00:19:01,070 --> 00:19:03,408
A few other students asked him about it,

349
00:19:03,409 --> 00:19:06,379
but he was adamant, so they decided to give up.

350
00:19:06,550 --> 00:19:08,049
One or two questions...

351
00:19:08,050 --> 00:19:09,918
won't affect what class grade they get.

352
00:19:09,919 --> 00:19:10,980
Calm down, ma'am.

353
00:19:11,219 --> 00:19:13,619
We can make up for it in the final exam and quizzes.

354
00:19:13,790 --> 00:19:16,260
My kid's spirit is broken!

355
00:19:20,730 --> 00:19:22,859
Why not call the head teacher?

356
00:19:23,560 --> 00:19:25,230
Ask for a board meeting to be held.

357
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:28,199
I don't want things to snowball.

358
00:19:41,209 --> 00:19:43,879
Give me the teacher's number.

359
00:19:44,879 --> 00:19:45,889
Okay.

360
00:19:49,189 --> 00:19:50,189
Goodness.

361
00:19:51,020 --> 00:19:54,090
I don't know what's happening to our world.

362
00:19:55,129 --> 00:19:57,959
It's just one midterm question for a high school freshman.

363
00:19:58,129 --> 00:20:00,830
We can't change the world, so we should change the answer.

364
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:04,139
(Chanyoung High teacher Pyo Sang Sub)

365
00:20:04,340 --> 00:20:06,810
What are you doing? You're getting involved?

366
00:20:07,169 --> 00:20:08,679
Ms. Seo. Don't do it.

367
00:20:09,240 --> 00:20:11,439
Hide your number at least.

368
00:20:12,580 --> 00:20:13,580
Hello?

369
00:20:14,379 --> 00:20:16,520
Is this Mr. Pyo Sang Sub the teacher?

370
00:20:17,379 --> 00:20:18,449
That's right.

371
00:20:19,020 --> 00:20:20,990
Hello. I appreciate your hard work.

372
00:20:21,219 --> 00:20:24,359
I want to ask you about number 11 from the midterm exam.

373
00:20:25,060 --> 00:20:26,990
The student thought...

374
00:20:28,929 --> 00:20:29,929
What?

375
00:20:32,730 --> 00:20:33,730
Yes.

376
00:20:35,070 --> 00:20:36,439
Okay, sure.

377
00:20:38,169 --> 00:20:39,310
Why? What did he say?

378
00:20:41,639 --> 00:20:42,639
What did he say?

379
00:20:43,740 --> 00:20:45,240
He wants to talk in person.

380
00:20:47,080 --> 00:20:48,749
This could go on the student record,

381
00:20:48,750 --> 00:20:50,980
so he knows you'll hesitate if he asks to see you.

382
00:20:51,250 --> 00:20:54,050
Tell the moms to call the head teacher.

383
00:20:55,590 --> 00:20:57,459
They don't want to snowball the matter.

384
00:20:58,419 --> 00:20:59,429
So what?

385
00:21:00,230 --> 00:21:01,230
You'll go?

386
00:21:04,500 --> 00:21:05,629
- But... - Ms. Seo.

387
00:21:08,070 --> 00:21:09,100
Ms. Seo.

388
00:21:13,969 --> 00:21:16,580
Hye Jin. There are procedures and protocols.

389
00:21:17,240 --> 00:21:18,779
It'll be even harder to make an objection...

390
00:21:18,780 --> 00:21:20,010
once grading is complete.

391
00:21:21,750 --> 00:21:23,820
Not doing anything won't make you a coward.

392
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:26,350
See you later.

(Chanyoung High School)

395
00:22:35,149 --> 00:22:38,490
(Chanyoung High School, Teachers' Office)

396
00:22:43,830 --> 00:22:46,769
The brats got someone to teach them in advance,

397
00:22:46,770 --> 00:22:48,529
so they don't focus in class...

398
00:22:48,530 --> 00:22:49,769
when they can't remember a thing.

399
00:22:49,770 --> 00:22:52,669
Excuse me. I'm here to see Pyo Sang Sub.

400
00:22:53,540 --> 00:22:55,780
- Okay. - I'm fine with it.

401
00:22:55,879 --> 00:22:57,209
- They can't... - Mr. Pyo.

402
00:22:57,980 --> 00:22:59,179
Someone's here to see you.

403
00:23:07,050 --> 00:23:08,090
Hello.

404
00:23:08,719 --> 00:23:10,320
I'm Pyo Sang Sub.

405
00:23:11,219 --> 00:23:12,490
Hello, sir.

406
00:23:13,230 --> 00:23:14,230
Hello.

407
00:23:15,230 --> 00:23:18,129
What are you here about?

408
00:23:18,969 --> 00:23:21,399
I called you about question number 11.

409
00:23:25,540 --> 00:23:26,609
Right.

410
00:23:29,379 --> 00:23:30,510
Then...

411
00:23:32,609 --> 00:23:34,550
How about you take a seat?

412
00:23:34,949 --> 00:23:36,549
- Could you... - Sure.

413
00:23:36,550 --> 00:23:38,178
Let's let them talk.

414
00:23:38,179 --> 00:23:39,290
You can sit here.

415
00:23:39,919 --> 00:23:41,050
- Here? - Yes.

416
00:23:41,149 --> 00:23:43,590
Yes. It's not a topic we can't discuss.

417
00:23:43,959 --> 00:23:45,020
Let's be transparent.

418
00:23:46,230 --> 00:23:47,230
Take a seat.

419
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:04,679
You're young for a mom of a teen.

420
00:24:08,649 --> 00:24:10,080
There's a problem with a question?

421
00:24:10,780 --> 00:24:12,418
I wouldn't call it a problem.

422
00:24:12,419 --> 00:24:13,419
This question...

423
00:24:14,719 --> 00:24:16,490
is to test if the student understands basic literary notions.

424
00:24:18,359 --> 00:24:20,060
They're to identify an example that uses...

425
00:24:20,429 --> 00:24:23,060
a contradictory expression that portrays their true feelings.

426
00:24:24,300 --> 00:24:27,330
Do the other Korean teachers share that opinion?

427
00:24:29,199 --> 00:24:30,839
We all took turns...

428
00:24:30,840 --> 00:24:33,369
solving the question to ensure it was valid.

429
00:24:33,540 --> 00:24:36,109
I'm not asking how you make and select exam questions.

430
00:24:37,179 --> 00:24:40,850
I'm asking if other teachers interpreted this the way you did.

431
00:24:43,219 --> 00:24:44,280
Well...

432
00:24:47,449 --> 00:24:48,449
Here.

433
00:24:51,790 --> 00:24:53,429
It's number 11.

434
00:24:56,800 --> 00:24:59,000
The poem is "Farm Dance" by Shin Kyung Rim.

435
00:24:59,399 --> 00:25:00,899
The backdrop is the 1970s.

436
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:03,070
When farming was collapsing.

437
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:05,199
The speaker...

438
00:25:05,770 --> 00:25:07,839
is cornered and feels helpless.

439
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:09,340
He's a farmer who sold his ox.

440
00:25:10,310 --> 00:25:11,540
He's in despair.

441
00:25:12,179 --> 00:25:15,580
And he described his feelings by saying he felt excited.

442
00:25:17,550 --> 00:25:18,619
That's contradictory.

443
00:25:19,490 --> 00:25:21,090
That makes it paradoxical.

444
00:25:22,250 --> 00:25:23,419
If you don't understand,

445
00:25:23,719 --> 00:25:25,730
look at the correct answer, number five.

446
00:25:27,129 --> 00:25:31,060
"For our love to exist, we must part."

447
00:25:33,169 --> 00:25:36,600
It's paradoxical, but you can't say it's only paradoxical.

448
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:39,608
The sentence where he says he got excited...

449
00:25:39,609 --> 00:25:40,709
isn't contradictory.

450
00:25:41,369 --> 00:25:42,780
If you're talking about...

451
00:25:43,010 --> 00:25:45,509
expressions that oppose how you really feel,

452
00:25:45,510 --> 00:25:47,879
don't you think number two could also be a correct answer?

453
00:25:48,750 --> 00:25:49,820
It's irony.

454
00:25:58,689 --> 00:26:01,230
You must be a mother and a Korean major.

455
00:26:01,889 --> 00:26:03,000
I'm not.

456
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:05,459
Are you not a mother...

457
00:26:06,399 --> 00:26:08,070
or are you not a Korean major?

458
00:26:10,169 --> 00:26:11,270
I'm neither.

459
00:26:14,770 --> 00:26:16,580
Leave a business card.

460
00:26:23,379 --> 00:26:24,879
Aren't you from an academy?

461
00:26:26,219 --> 00:26:28,350
Many academies expected this question.

462
00:26:32,830 --> 00:26:36,030
We fell into your scope of defense?

463
00:26:37,429 --> 00:26:40,529
I came hoping to have a wholesome discussion...

464
00:26:40,530 --> 00:26:41,629
about the question.

465
00:26:43,369 --> 00:26:44,669
I've never heard of...

466
00:26:45,540 --> 00:26:47,239
teachers from a school and an academy...

467
00:26:47,240 --> 00:26:48,840
having a discussion.

468
00:26:50,310 --> 00:26:53,079
Could all the Korean teachers have another look at...

469
00:26:53,080 --> 00:26:54,709
I explained it to the students.

470
00:26:55,879 --> 00:26:57,919
That the reality and poetic expression...

471
00:26:58,080 --> 00:26:59,790
is contradictory.

472
00:27:01,119 --> 00:27:04,559
If the kids understood the speaker's miserable and hopeless situation...

473
00:27:04,560 --> 00:27:05,790
I told you already.

474
00:27:05,959 --> 00:27:07,489
This is about literary notions.

475
00:27:07,490 --> 00:27:08,889
It's about literary notions,

476
00:27:09,629 --> 00:27:11,198
but students should also be able to...

477
00:27:11,199 --> 00:27:13,800
understand the backdrop and deduce the speaker's feelings.

478
00:27:14,530 --> 00:27:15,840
The multiple choice options...

479
00:27:17,669 --> 00:27:18,869
were quite refreshing.

480
00:27:23,240 --> 00:27:26,409
I didn't ask you to comment on the level of our questions.

481
00:27:36,419 --> 00:27:38,290
"We didn't know what to expect..."

482
00:27:38,490 --> 00:27:39,959
"from a new teacher."

483
00:27:42,030 --> 00:27:43,459
That sounds like what you're saying.

484
00:27:47,030 --> 00:27:48,500
You didn't expect this.

485
00:27:49,300 --> 00:27:50,969
You collected past exams...

486
00:27:51,369 --> 00:27:52,669
and analyzed the trend.

487
00:27:53,369 --> 00:27:56,310
We analyzed them every semester with respect.

488
00:28:00,879 --> 00:28:02,580
That is irony.

489
00:28:04,050 --> 00:28:05,850
You're here to challenge the school...

490
00:28:06,490 --> 00:28:08,090
and you mention respect.

491
00:28:08,990 --> 00:28:10,189
What challenge?

492
00:28:10,659 --> 00:28:12,559
Passage selection, level adjustment,

493
00:28:12,560 --> 00:28:13,790
and connection to the KSAT.

494
00:28:13,929 --> 00:28:16,300
Chanyoung High's exams are always well thought-out,

495
00:28:16,600 --> 00:28:18,559
and I never considered challenging you.

496
00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:19,600
You're saying...

497
00:28:20,369 --> 00:28:21,600
this isn't a challenge?

498
00:28:21,929 --> 00:28:23,669
I call it a discussion.

499
00:28:26,010 --> 00:28:28,169
Do you know how many students came by today?

500
00:28:29,070 --> 00:28:31,208
I'm not rising up against what you think.

501
00:28:31,209 --> 00:28:32,439
Let's not go too far.

502
00:28:33,080 --> 00:28:34,080
Don't you feel ashamed?

503
00:28:34,081 --> 00:28:36,379
I'd feel ashamed if I were wrong.

504
00:28:36,619 --> 00:28:39,019
But saying paradox is correct and irony isn't...

505
00:28:39,020 --> 00:28:40,749
You sent the kids to me to beg for points...

506
00:28:40,750 --> 00:28:42,090
and mess up the grade system.

507
00:28:42,619 --> 00:28:43,688
Aren't you ashamed of that?

508
00:28:43,689 --> 00:28:45,020
Hey, how about...

509
00:28:45,119 --> 00:28:47,158
you take this somewhere else?

510
00:28:47,159 --> 00:28:49,830
I think you should continue in another room.

511
00:28:50,699 --> 00:28:52,000
Shall we go somewhere else?

512
00:28:52,359 --> 00:28:53,530
Why should we?

513
00:28:53,570 --> 00:28:55,800
Because I understand why you came up with this question.

514
00:28:58,300 --> 00:28:59,869
Why did I come up with this question?

515
00:29:00,969 --> 00:29:02,070
It's old.

516
00:29:07,480 --> 00:29:08,509
What?

517
00:29:08,510 --> 00:29:11,178
Questions like this that focus only on...

518
00:29:11,179 --> 00:29:13,689
differentiating notions like paradox and irony...

519
00:29:14,149 --> 00:29:15,790
vanished from KSAT.

520
00:29:16,719 --> 00:29:17,820
Because it's old.

521
00:29:18,859 --> 00:29:21,929
But I still teach these notions to my students.

522
00:29:22,060 --> 00:29:25,699
Because teachers still teach these notions.

523
00:29:26,399 --> 00:29:27,469
At schools.

524
00:29:29,199 --> 00:29:30,599
(What academy is she from?)

525
00:29:30,600 --> 00:29:32,040
What academy is she from?

526
00:29:34,070 --> 00:29:35,609
Doesn't she look familiar?

527
00:29:36,040 --> 00:29:37,240
Is that for real?

528
00:29:37,740 --> 00:29:38,810
It's no longer in KSAT?

529
00:29:39,649 --> 00:29:40,780
I studied it in high school.

530
00:29:41,810 --> 00:29:43,679
And you still won't reconsider my appeal.

531
00:29:45,250 --> 00:29:46,550
Is it because you know...

532
00:29:47,350 --> 00:29:49,259
students won't object too much for fear...

533
00:29:49,260 --> 00:29:50,490
it'll go on their student records?

534
00:29:57,760 --> 00:29:59,330
How dare you ridicule public education?

535
00:30:05,699 --> 00:30:07,638
Sorry, guys. Wait outside.

536
00:30:07,639 --> 00:30:09,638
I need to hand in a paper.

537
00:30:09,639 --> 00:30:10,639
Later.

538
00:30:11,840 --> 00:30:13,810
Five... No. Come back in ten minutes.

539
00:30:13,909 --> 00:30:15,378
- What? - Do as you're told.

540
00:30:15,379 --> 00:30:17,949
Go. See you later.

541
00:30:18,280 --> 00:30:20,819
Am I the bad person for telling kids to ask about their grades,

542
00:30:20,820 --> 00:30:22,489
or are you the bad person for misrepresenting...

543
00:30:22,490 --> 00:30:24,219
the school's authority by using the student record as leverage?

544
00:30:24,290 --> 00:30:26,529
Awesome. That was insane.

545
00:30:26,530 --> 00:30:27,560
She crushed him.

546
00:30:27,689 --> 00:30:29,188
Hey, what does "misrepresent" mean?

547
00:30:29,189 --> 00:30:31,529
- Who knows? Darn it. - Is it a name of a woman?

548
00:30:31,530 --> 00:30:33,429
All right. Mr. Pyo.

549
00:30:33,929 --> 00:30:36,199
Calm down. Don't lose your composure here.

550
00:30:36,369 --> 00:30:37,740
How dare I challenge the school?

551
00:30:38,500 --> 00:30:39,540
Or cause a disturbance?

552
00:30:40,340 --> 00:30:41,469
That's preposterous.

553
00:30:41,570 --> 00:30:44,109
The direction of public education is our guideline.

554
00:30:44,679 --> 00:30:45,679
You!

555
00:30:47,080 --> 00:30:48,378
You too. Enough is enough.

556
00:30:48,379 --> 00:30:50,218
We'll have a discussion regarding this matter.

557
00:30:50,219 --> 00:30:51,820
What discussion? No way.

558
00:30:51,980 --> 00:30:53,919
I ask that you let the students retake the test.

559
00:30:55,090 --> 00:30:57,858
Okay. I got your point. You should get going now. Please go.

560
00:30:57,859 --> 00:30:59,389
What do you mean?

561
00:31:00,429 --> 00:31:01,530
I'll get going now.

562
00:31:04,659 --> 00:31:06,570
I ask that you have a wise discussion regarding this.

563
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:08,070
Please.

564
00:31:10,540 --> 00:31:11,699
"Wise?"

565
00:31:13,510 --> 00:31:15,809
Hey, Mr. Pyo. You can't grab her shoulder like that.

566
00:31:15,810 --> 00:31:17,879
- Did you say, "wise?" - You can't do this.

567
00:31:17,939 --> 00:31:19,948
- Mr. Pyo. Let go. - You must let her go. All right.

568
00:31:19,949 --> 00:31:20,979
- You can't do this. - Let go of her.

569
00:31:20,980 --> 00:31:21,980
Get your hands off me!

570
00:31:22,280 --> 00:31:23,679
You can't grab her shoulder like that!

571
00:31:23,919 --> 00:31:24,980
One more thing.

572
00:31:26,990 --> 00:31:28,419
As for the multiple choices of this question,

573
00:31:29,219 --> 00:31:30,888
they included references to Middle Korean...

574
00:31:30,889 --> 00:31:32,730
which was never part of the school curriculum up until now.

575
00:31:33,030 --> 00:31:34,260
Aren't you the one...

576
00:31:34,659 --> 00:31:36,158
who put that question on the exam,

577
00:31:36,159 --> 00:31:37,459
assuming that they learned it at the academy?

578
00:31:40,869 --> 00:31:42,669
There are many ways I can raise an issue with this.

579
00:31:42,800 --> 00:31:43,800
Gosh.

580
00:31:46,909 --> 00:31:47,939
Come on.

581
00:31:50,379 --> 00:31:51,679

- Hello. - Hey.

589
00:34:10,750 --> 00:34:11,980
- Hello. - Hi.

590
00:34:37,310 --> 00:34:38,479
So which area...

591
00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:40,049
are you guys looking into for your marital house?

592
00:34:41,449 --> 00:34:42,580
Gangseo-gu.

593
00:34:42,920 --> 00:34:44,580
What? Not Daechi-dong?

594
00:34:45,179 --> 00:34:47,489
Why? You can easily get a loan from your company.

595
00:34:49,860 --> 00:34:51,189
I've been working only for two years.

596
00:34:51,190 --> 00:34:52,690
How could I get a house in Daechi-dong with just a loan?

597
00:34:53,860 --> 00:34:55,190
What did your family say?

598
00:34:55,830 --> 00:34:57,329
Well, they said they would take out...

599
00:34:57,330 --> 00:34:59,230
a loan for me with their house as collateral.

600
00:34:59,259 --> 00:35:00,270
All right then.

601
00:35:01,600 --> 00:35:02,670
Why won't you accept it?

602
00:35:04,369 --> 00:35:06,710
There's no depth in your thinking. Seriously.

603
00:35:06,940 --> 00:35:08,069
What is it?

604
00:35:08,810 --> 00:35:11,209
My younger sister was fiercely against the idea.

605
00:35:11,210 --> 00:35:12,310
Park Tae Hee?

606
00:35:12,810 --> 00:35:14,310
Gosh. She's like a viper.

607
00:35:14,549 --> 00:35:16,319
Hey, the apartments here...

608
00:35:16,719 --> 00:35:19,719
are our parents' only retirement plan and pride.

609
00:35:20,190 --> 00:35:21,819
Tae Hyun isn't like you. He won't let them risk it.

610
00:35:22,049 --> 00:35:23,318
Is your girlfriend on the same page?

611
00:35:23,319 --> 00:35:25,889
Well, I'll have to convince her, but it won't be easy.

612
00:35:26,360 --> 00:35:28,258
She said she had never moved out of Gangnam.

613
00:35:28,259 --> 00:35:30,330
Gosh. Like we ever moved out either.

614
00:35:32,230 --> 00:35:34,529
Hey, you need to think carefully.

615
00:35:35,100 --> 00:35:37,239
It's really hard to come back here once you move out.

616
00:35:37,369 --> 00:35:38,400
Hey.

617
00:35:39,040 --> 00:35:40,109
You said you wanted to study more,

618
00:35:40,110 --> 00:35:41,569
so you're still in the intellectual ivory tower.

619
00:35:41,969 --> 00:35:43,440
How could you say stuff like that so carelessly?

620
00:35:43,610 --> 00:35:45,580
I should say so more than others because I'm still in school.

621
00:35:46,239 --> 00:35:47,279
Gosh.

622
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:51,080
Hey, do you see those kids?

623
00:35:51,350 --> 00:35:52,350
Yes.

624
00:35:53,219 --> 00:35:54,420
They start wearing that jacket...

625
00:35:54,589 --> 00:35:56,690
as soon as the heat of the dog days goes away.

626
00:35:57,520 --> 00:35:58,988
The envious looks they get from people...

627
00:35:58,989 --> 00:36:00,730
help them forget all about the pain from heat rashes.

628
00:36:01,529 --> 00:36:02,790
I get it, though.

629
00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:04,599
If I scored better on Math...

630
00:36:04,600 --> 00:36:06,429
Gosh, they're also in med school.

631
00:36:06,830 --> 00:36:08,130
That will be their heirloom.

632
00:36:08,500 --> 00:36:10,000
That will at least work as a letter of credit.

633
00:36:12,170 --> 00:36:14,239
Check out the community website for test-takers.

634
00:36:14,270 --> 00:36:15,539
Forget about the test-takers.

635
00:36:15,540 --> 00:36:17,639
You'll mostly find students from prestigious universities.

636
00:36:18,179 --> 00:36:20,009
Acting like the king on that website is the most fun they can get.

637
00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:21,880
So what's your point?

638
00:36:22,779 --> 00:36:23,819
If I were you,

639
00:36:24,880 --> 00:36:27,020
I'd deal with the embarrassment and never leave Daechi-dong.

640
00:36:27,750 --> 00:36:29,520
Even if our country goes down,

641
00:36:30,420 --> 00:36:32,960
this neighborhood will never go down as long as there's still ambition.

642
00:36:33,130 --> 00:36:35,029
Not leaving here is cool and all.

643
00:36:35,330 --> 00:36:37,799
Why should he ask for his parents' help to do so?

644
00:36:38,199 --> 00:36:39,259
Hey.

645
00:36:39,600 --> 00:36:40,669
Do you actually believe...

646
00:36:40,670 --> 00:36:41,770
being a self-made man is possible in this day and age?

647
00:36:42,429 --> 00:36:43,670
Why can't he?

648
00:36:44,170 --> 00:36:45,469
I think I can be one.

649
00:36:45,600 --> 00:36:46,669
- Gosh. - That crazy jerk.

650
00:36:46,670 --> 00:36:47,770
So that's how a zoomer thinks?

651
00:36:47,909 --> 00:36:49,568
What? Will you be an online streamer or something?

652
00:36:49,569 --> 00:36:50,940
Don't be ridiculous.

653
00:36:53,880 --> 00:36:56,520
Actually, he might be able to hit it big with that.

654
00:36:57,480 --> 00:36:58,980
- That thing. - Right.

655
00:37:00,650 --> 00:37:01,690
Don't do it.

656
00:37:02,350 --> 00:37:03,690

713

Gosh. You can't just grab a man's hand like that.

714
00:40:09,409 --> 00:40:10,839
Come on. Stop goofing around now.

715

00:41:11,940 --> 00:41:13,040
Of course.

732
00:41:13,270 --> 00:41:14,810
The sky is the limit for you.

733
00:41:16,069 --> 00:41:17,080
That's right.

734
00:41:22,980 --> 00:41:24,219
Isn't work boring?

735
00:41:25,580 --> 00:41:27,150
Don't forget this is Korea.

736
00:41:27,819 --> 00:41:29,088
People still studied...

737
00:41:29,089 --> 00:41:30,759
for entrance exams even during wartime.

738
00:41:32,190 --> 00:41:34,830
Boring? I'd be sad if you think there's a dull moment with my job.

739
00:41:37,759 --> 00:41:39,199
Then how happy are you with your job?

740
00:41:41,069 --> 00:41:42,630
I couldn't be happier. It's fantastic.

741
00:41:43,770 --> 00:41:44,770
Do you mean that?

742
00:41:44,771 --> 00:41:46,739
Yes, I do. I have the best job ever.

743
00:41:47,940 --> 00:41:49,110
Is that really your honest answer?

744
00:41:52,310 --> 00:41:53,449
Give me your employee ID card.

745
00:41:55,580 --> 00:41:56,750
Why?

746
00:41:56,949 --> 00:41:57,980
Come on.

747
00:42:05,960 --> 00:42:07,060
I know...

748
00:42:07,259 --> 00:42:09,259
what new recruits say after the orientation.

749
00:42:09,730 --> 00:42:11,159
That blue blood runs in their body.

750
00:42:12,400 --> 00:42:13,500
It's not the same anymore.

751
00:42:14,330 --> 00:42:15,368
My annual salary is probably higher than...

752
00:42:15,369 --> 00:42:17,298
that of your supervising manager who had to change his blood color.

753
00:42:17,299 --> 00:42:18,799
At least your general manager... No.

754
00:42:19,400 --> 00:42:21,170
I probably get paid more than your team leader.

755
00:42:33,389 --> 00:42:34,949
Get home safely. It was fun talking to you today.

756
00:42:35,290 --> 00:42:36,319
See you around.

757
00:42:36,420 --> 00:42:37,520
- Sure. - Okay.

00:43:01,850 --> 00:43:04,850

00:43:35,310 --> 00:43:37,020
Shouldn't you get a new AC in your bedroom?

763
00:43:37,679 --> 00:43:39,150
What? Why all of a sudden?

764
00:43:41,049 --> 00:43:42,589
The heat waves always get to you guys every summer.

765
00:43:42,989 --> 00:43:44,719
Or change the TV in the living room.

766
00:43:45,489 --> 00:43:47,758
Your older brother got us a new TV two years ago.

767
00:43:47,759 --> 00:43:48,790
That's a waste.

768
00:43:48,860 --> 00:43:50,860
What about a dishwasher, a dryer, or home appliances?

769
00:43:51,100 --> 00:43:53,000
You wanted something like that at a new apartment.

770
00:43:53,400 --> 00:43:54,900
Is there a promotion for employees?

771
00:43:57,069 --> 00:43:58,270
Give me a list of appliances you need to upgrade.

772
00:43:58,440 --> 00:43:59,500
Okay.

773
00:44:03,679 --> 00:44:04,839
How's work?

774
00:44:07,409 --> 00:44:08,880
Nothing has changed. It still looks daunting.

775
00:44:11,119 --> 00:44:13,619
A position in the strategy department is great.

776
00:44:14,020 --> 00:44:15,750
See if you can apply to work in one of their overseas branches.

777
00:44:17,989 --> 00:44:19,690
It's time for you to change your career paths.

778
00:44:22,690 --> 00:44:24,560
Change my career path? Sounds good.

779
00:44:25,460 --> 00:44:26,600
- Yes. Hello? - Oh, that.

780
00:44:27,299 --> 00:44:29,198
- Hello. - I see. They're in a meeting.

781
00:44:29,199 --> 00:44:31,000
- Yes. They're in a meeting. - Gosh, no.

782
00:44:31,170 --> 00:44:33,170
- Can I take a message? - Nothing has been decided yet.

783
00:44:33,270 --> 00:44:35,068
- Yes. Okay. - They're still discussing.

784
00:44:35,069 --> 00:44:37,310
- Would you like to leave a message? - I see. Compensation?

785
00:44:37,480 --> 00:44:39,309
Gosh. The teachers...

786
00:44:39,310 --> 00:44:41,080

- Yes, all the Korean teachers... - Yes.

Come in.

796
00:46:56,179 --> 00:46:57,580
- Please sit down. - Thank you.

My day starts in the afternoon.

799
00:47:26,540 --> 00:47:27,610
Right about now,

800
00:47:28,880 --> 00:47:30,750
the students must have gotten the notice.

801
00:47:33,549 --> 00:47:34,949
They will retake the exam.

802
00:47:40,630 --> 00:47:43,630
I'd like to know how you feel about this.

803
00:47:44,860 --> 00:47:46,529
I didn't do it to make myself feel good.

804
00:47:51,069 --> 00:47:53,040
The students could have notified me.

805
00:47:53,869 --> 00:47:55,139
Up until last year,

806
00:47:57,080 --> 00:47:58,279
I taught in a regular neighborhood...

807
00:47:59,339 --> 00:48:00,880
with admission restrictions.

808
00:48:04,219 --> 00:48:06,020
I was transferred to Daechi-dong, famously reputed for education.

809
00:48:06,980 --> 00:48:08,150
And it was my first exam.

810
00:48:10,250 --> 00:48:11,920
I must have unknowingly felt I had to prove myself...

811
00:48:13,830 --> 00:48:15,189
due to their scholarly ambition and educational level...

812
00:48:15,190 --> 00:48:16,560
which I didn't notice...

813
00:48:17,830 --> 00:48:18,960
at my last school.

814
00:48:21,529 --> 00:48:23,000
I couldn't admit I had made an error...

815
00:48:23,469 --> 00:48:25,170
when the students first came to me...

816
00:48:26,139 --> 00:48:27,869
probably because I felt I was defeated.

817
00:48:29,139 --> 00:48:30,239
I'm sure you can't understand that.

818
00:48:31,739 --> 00:48:34,079
I'd like to say this again. It was a good question in my...

819
00:48:34,080 --> 00:48:35,150
No.

820
00:48:35,909 --> 00:48:38,150
You were right that my question was outdated and lacked depth.

821
00:48:39,319 --> 00:48:40,420
I apologize.

822
00:48:41,219 --> 00:48:44,158
I shouldn't be the recipient of that apology. The students...

823
00:48:44,159 --> 00:48:46,360
It was my first exam in a new district.

824
00:48:47,860 --> 00:48:49,659
It wasn't hard for me to admit my error.

825
00:48:52,199 --> 00:48:53,659
So I insulted you...

826
00:48:54,500 --> 00:48:55,569
and...

827
00:48:56,929 --> 00:48:58,339
acted improperly.

828
00:49:01,339 --> 00:49:03,779
I don't need your apology. I just...

829
00:49:03,880 --> 00:49:04,880
Right.

830
00:49:05,710 --> 00:49:06,739
You just...

831
00:49:07,779 --> 00:49:09,909
needed the students to retake the exam.

832
00:49:10,850 --> 00:49:11,949
I'm well aware of your goal.

833
00:49:14,190 --> 00:49:15,250
But it didn't mean...

834
00:49:16,020 --> 00:49:17,089
I should turn a blind eye...

835
00:49:17,520 --> 00:49:19,560
to my insulting remark and improper behavior around you.

836
00:49:23,130 --> 00:49:25,060
Well, I'm the one who may have overstepped the boundary.

837
00:49:30,069 --> 00:49:32,799
I do have one question.

838
00:49:34,239 --> 00:49:36,569
There were many peaceful ways you could have raised an issue...

839
00:49:36,909 --> 00:49:38,110
regarding the error in the question.

840
00:49:39,310 --> 00:49:42,210
Why did you have to resort to such an offensive way?

841
00:49:49,049 --> 00:49:50,089
Well,

842
00:49:51,619 --> 00:49:55,089
knowing the reason behind that won't change anything now.

843
00:49:59,100 --> 00:50:00,400
Actually, this incident...

844
00:50:01,869 --> 00:50:03,230
motivated me quite a lot.

845
00:50:05,170 --> 00:50:08,239
I learned that the students trusted the academy more than the school,

846
00:50:09,670 --> 00:50:11,110
to them, their school was just a place...

847
00:50:12,310 --> 00:50:13,380
where they earned grades,

848
00:50:14,610 --> 00:50:16,350
and schoolteachers just filled out the student records.

849
00:50:19,179 --> 00:50:20,989
I ended up admitting to them firsthand.

850
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:33,060
Knowing all these...

851
00:50:34,100 --> 00:50:36,900
and personally experiencing them are completely different.

852
00:50:38,400 --> 00:50:40,839
Why are you telling me this?

853
00:50:41,040 --> 00:50:42,569
I wanted you of all people to know something.

854
00:50:43,569 --> 00:50:46,080
But please excuse me...

855
00:50:46,779 --> 00:50:49,150
for I can't bring myself to refer to you as a teacher.

856
00:50:50,719 --> 00:50:53,349
It's all right. So what did you want to tell me?

857
00:50:53,350 --> 00:50:54,420
That I am prepared...

858
00:50:56,489 --> 00:50:58,060
for a prolonged battle.

859
00:50:58,489 --> 00:51:00,060
- A battle? - I...

860
00:51:01,630 --> 00:51:03,460
chose to be a teacher at 19...

861
00:51:04,159 --> 00:51:05,699
and majored education in college.

862
00:51:08,630 --> 00:51:10,429
In the corner of my old and rotten box...

863
00:51:12,770 --> 00:51:14,639
lies my last shred of dignity albeit menial.

864
00:51:20,549 --> 00:51:21,549
I...

865
00:51:22,810 --> 00:51:24,850
am not someone who educates students...

866
00:51:25,920 --> 00:51:27,080
because I'm bound by contract to do so.

867
00:51:29,920 --> 00:51:32,318
Someone who signs a contract that bounds them as an educator?

868
00:51:32,319 --> 00:51:33,690
But even those people have a duty.

869
00:51:39,799 --> 00:51:40,869
I'm glad to hear that.

870
00:51:42,830 --> 00:51:43,869
We...

871
00:51:44,940 --> 00:51:46,639
are very well aware of where we stand.

872
00:51:50,440 --> 00:51:52,480
I'm sorry, but can I take a rain check on the meal?

873
00:51:52,639 --> 00:51:54,480
Some students have yet to finish their exams.

874
00:51:54,549 --> 00:51:57,080
- Sure. We'll do that. - Right.

875
00:52:39,360 --> 00:52:40,589
We need to talk.

876
00:52:41,960 --> 00:52:43,060
It's good news.

877
00:52:44,759 --> 00:52:46,759
All right. Please take a seat.

878
00:52:49,369 --> 00:52:51,799
Ms. Seo, grant me a bonus.

879
00:52:52,369 --> 00:52:53,369
Sorry?

880
00:52:55,409 --> 00:52:57,778
We're swamped with consultation bookings...

881
00:52:57,779 --> 00:52:59,040
to the point that makes me dizzy.

882
00:52:59,279 --> 00:53:00,909
I even had to skip lunch today.

883
00:53:01,110 --> 00:53:02,380
Gosh, I apologize.

884
00:53:07,049 --> 00:53:09,589
I'm aware of all the hours you've been putting in,

885
00:53:10,420 --> 00:53:12,190
but could you perhaps...

886
00:53:12,690 --> 00:53:15,130
adjust your class schedule starting next month?

887
00:53:15,790 --> 00:53:19,929
Reducing the waiting list would be optimal.

888
00:53:20,869 --> 00:53:22,569
For another school apart from Chanyoung High?

889
00:53:22,630 --> 00:53:24,839
Yes, for Daesan Foreign Language High School as well.

890
00:53:28,069 --> 00:53:31,310
Considering the amount of classes you currently teach,

891
00:53:31,739 --> 00:53:33,639
I feel guilty asking for more of your time.

892
00:53:35,009 --> 00:53:36,480
But the director is adamant.

893
00:53:38,819 --> 00:53:41,049
I don't have time to fit in more classes,

894
00:53:41,219 --> 00:53:42,750
but I'll see what I can do.

895
00:53:46,520 --> 00:53:48,888
You'll wear yourself out at this rate.

896
00:53:48,889 --> 00:53:50,259
I'm quite all right.

897
00:53:53,100 --> 00:53:56,199
Excuse me. We're here for the 4pm consultation.

898
00:53:56,299 --> 00:53:59,799
Right. Your children go to Chanyoung High, right?

899
00:54:00,600 --> 00:54:02,339
Ms. Kim, then I'll...

900
00:54:02,909 --> 00:54:05,909
Please allow me to introduce you to the famous Ms. Seo Hye Jin.

901
00:54:06,440 --> 00:54:07,880
- I see. - I see.

902
00:54:08,310 --> 00:54:09,380
Hello.

903
00:54:10,179 --> 00:54:12,319
You look 100 times better in person.

904
00:54:12,679 --> 00:54:14,449
We're still wait-listed,

905
00:54:14,790 --> 00:54:17,350
so we came by to ask how things were coming along.

906
00:54:17,860 --> 00:54:19,690
I apologize for inadvertently causing you inconvenience.

907
00:54:20,489 --> 00:54:22,730
Let me escort you to the consultation room.

908
00:54:22,960 --> 00:54:24,028
You should know...

909
00:54:24,029 --> 00:54:26,600
that Ms. Seo might be accepting more students soon.

910
00:54:27,360 --> 00:54:29,670
- This way, please. - Right.

911
00:54:32,500 --> 00:54:34,469
Right in here.

912
00:54:34,569 --> 00:54:35,569
Sure.

913
00:54:37,710 --> 00:54:39,579
Raise your hand if you wrote the wrong answer...

914
00:54:39,580 --> 00:54:40,610
for question number 14 on my mock exam.

915
00:54:44,779 --> 00:54:46,080
Aren't you taking your test tomorrow?

916
00:54:47,819 --> 00:54:49,589
Never did I think you'd get that wrong.

917
00:54:51,619 --> 00:54:54,019
I said you'd be asked to identify the speaker's alter ego...

918
00:54:54,020 --> 00:54:55,330
in "Recollections of a Beautiful Woman."

919
00:54:55,860 --> 00:54:57,759
Don't try to relate to the speaker's feelings.

920
00:54:58,000 --> 00:54:59,529
You won't be able to, right?

921
00:54:59,929 --> 00:55:00,929
Just memorize the answers.

922
00:55:01,529 --> 00:55:03,900
Remember what I said your purpose of studying was?

923
00:55:04,600 --> 00:55:05,900
It's to answer questions on tests.

924
00:55:07,670 --> 00:55:10,069
All right. Let's go over what'll come up in your exam.

925
00:55:10,610 --> 00:55:11,610
Keep up.

926
00:55:11,611 --> 00:55:13,879
These must come to mind regarding gasa poetry.

927
00:55:13,880 --> 00:55:14,909
How many are there?

928
00:55:15,080 --> 00:55:16,110
- Three. - Three.

929
00:55:16,449 --> 00:55:18,580
Don't lose your spirits. What are those three?

930
00:55:19,750 --> 00:55:21,119
- Opening. - Opening.

931
00:55:22,949 --> 00:55:24,020
- Main. - Main.

932
00:55:25,759 --> 00:55:27,690
- Ending. - Ending.

933
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:35,770
Bye. Have a good one.

934
00:55:42,409 --> 00:55:43,969
- Gosh. - Ms. Seo, are you done for the day?

935
00:55:44,580 --> 00:55:46,839
Why are you still here at this late hour?

936
00:55:47,810 --> 00:55:50,380
Things truly must be hectic for you.

937
00:55:50,880 --> 00:55:52,850
- Sorry? - I have tomorrow to prepare for.

938
00:55:53,279 --> 00:55:54,819
The written test for new instructors.

939
00:55:55,250 --> 00:55:56,290
Oh, right!

940
00:55:58,060 --> 00:56:00,060
I have to clean up the classroom before heading home.

941
00:56:00,889 --> 00:56:02,129
That's hard work you're doing.

942
00:56:02,130 --> 00:56:03,929
As if my work could ever compare to yours.

943
00:56:04,159 --> 00:56:05,199
Head on home, then.

944
00:56:15,170 --> 00:56:17,139
(Audition to become a teacher and win 50,000 dollars.)

945

(Daechi Chase)

950
00:56:53,509 --> 00:56:55,380
Your name has been confirmed.

951
00:56:56,610 --> 00:56:58,049
- May I have your name? - It's Nam Chung Mi.

952
00:56:58,920 --> 00:57:00,020
Your name has been confirmed.

953
00:57:01,690 --> 00:57:03,318
At the large classroom down the hall,

954
00:57:03,319 --> 00:57:04,888
you will be told where the test is being taken.

955
00:57:04,889 --> 00:57:05,889
Right.

956
00:57:06,719 --> 00:57:08,630
- May I have your name? - It's Kim Sung Woo.

957
00:57:24,009 --> 00:57:25,009
Excuse me.

958
00:57:26,739 --> 00:57:27,909
Which subject are you applying for?

959
00:57:29,810 --> 00:57:30,920
English.

960
00:57:31,250 --> 00:57:33,319
I see. For me, it's Korean.

961
00:57:35,049 --> 00:57:37,020
- Right. - Is it your first time?

962
00:57:38,389 --> 00:57:39,389
Sorry?

963
00:57:39,520 --> 00:57:40,989
Is it your first time in Daechi-dong?

964
00:57:43,989 --> 00:57:46,330
I've been teaching classes once a week,

965
00:57:46,560 --> 00:57:48,170
but it's my first time applying for a full-time job.

966
00:57:48,529 --> 00:57:49,529
I see.

967
00:57:50,029 --> 00:57:51,069
It's my second time.

968
00:57:51,569 --> 00:57:53,770
I applied for a job elsewhere but didn't make the cut.

969
00:57:54,100 --> 00:57:55,369
Currently, I teach in Junggye-dong.

970
00:57:56,509 --> 00:57:57,940
Junggye-dong is just as cut-throat.

971
00:57:58,580 --> 00:57:59,810
Still,

972
00:58:00,409 --> 00:58:02,480
you need to make it in Daechi-dong...

973
00:58:03,110 --> 00:58:04,650
if you want to be hired by the big names.

974
00:58:06,819 --> 00:58:08,250
I wish you the best of luck.

975
00:58:10,489 --> 00:58:11,520
Darn.

976
00:58:12,259 --> 00:58:13,259
I can't believe I'm retaking an exam...

977
00:58:13,259 --> 00:58:14,259
which is what I didn't even do for the KSAT.

978
00:58:17,460 --> 00:58:18,799
Honestly, I'm in disbelief.

979
00:58:20,199 --> 00:58:22,770
The result will depend on how hard we worked.

980
00:58:23,369 --> 00:58:24,739
I bet they all graduated from SKY.

981
00:58:26,670 --> 00:58:27,670
Sorry?

982
00:58:28,440 --> 00:58:29,569
The universities they graduated.

983
00:58:32,940 --> 00:58:34,409
It'll be hard to find those who haven't.

984
00:58:36,210 --> 00:58:37,279
There's me.

985
00:58:40,480 --> 00:58:41,589
I let my talents speak.

986
00:58:42,949 --> 00:58:44,020
I wish you good luck.

987
00:58:48,259 --> 00:58:49,759
The written test has begun.

988
00:58:50,389 --> 00:58:51,500
How does it seem?

989
00:58:51,799 --> 00:58:54,830
Will one of them be the next big academy instructor?

990
00:58:55,130 --> 00:58:57,130
We won't know until we see their test lectures.

991
00:58:57,839 --> 00:58:59,940
As if their test lectures can tell you anything.

992
00:59:00,770 --> 00:59:02,309
Even those with 5 to 10 years of experience...

993
00:59:02,310 --> 00:59:04,480
choke a little during test lectures.

994
00:59:05,080 --> 00:59:07,750
I had to drink two bottles of calming tonic before mine.

(Korean Department Written Exam)

996
00:59:26,360 --> 00:59:27,400
Hold on a second.

(Daechi Chase)

998
01:00:27,319 --> 01:00:29,629
Good job, everyone. Your time is up.

999

The applicant at the back of every row...

1000
01:00:30,960 --> 01:00:32,729
will collect the test papers and answer cards...

1001
01:00:32,730 --> 01:00:34,060
and bring them to me.

1002
01:00:39,569 --> 01:00:42,169
You may leave after handing them in.

1004
01:00:53,150 --> 01:00:54,150
Excuse me.

1005
01:00:54,449 --> 01:00:56,690
Hi, I'm Nam Chung Mi who works out of Junggye-dong.

1006
01:00:57,350 --> 01:00:59,290
Right. I'm Lee Jun Ho.

1007
01:01:00,319 --> 01:01:01,988
It's not every day we get to meet others this way,

1008
01:01:01,989 --> 01:01:03,659
so how about a cup of coffee?

1009
01:01:03,830 --> 01:01:04,860
Drinks would also be fine.

1010
01:01:04,960 --> 01:01:06,960
We can exchange information about other academies.

1011
01:01:07,130 --> 01:01:08,130
It's a good opportunity.

1012
01:01:09,270 --> 01:01:10,299
Shall we?

1013
01:01:14,040 --> 01:01:15,068
Maybe next time.

1014
01:01:15,069 --> 01:01:17,170
I forgot I had a previous engagement.

1015
01:01:17,270 --> 01:01:18,439
Sorry about that. Have a good one.

1016
01:01:18,440 --> 01:01:19,779
- Sure. I'll see you around. - Right.

1017

1018
01:01:27,850 --> 01:01:28,920
What is this?

1019
01:01:30,750 --> 01:01:31,790
I took the test.

1020
01:01:32,560 --> 01:01:33,589
Why, exactly?

1021
01:01:33,960 --> 01:01:35,929
I'm looking for a job and taking a new career path.

1022
01:01:41,270 --> 01:01:44,469
(84 out of 100)

1023
01:01:48,569 --> 01:01:49,810
It's raining hard.

1024
01:01:50,839 --> 01:01:52,610
- Do you have an umbrella? - Yes.

1025
01:01:52,710 --> 01:01:54,649
- Let's go. - I have the card.

1026
01:01:54,650 --> 01:01:55,679
Sure.

1027
01:01:56,409 --> 01:01:58,020
- I'll ask. - Right.

01:02:11,130 --> 01:02:13,000
- Mr. Yoon. - Yes?

1031
01:02:15,199 --> 01:02:16,199
It's nothing.

1032
01:02:16,900 --> 01:02:17,969
Why? What is it?

1033
01:02:18,299 --> 01:02:20,239
It's really nothing. I'll take a rain check.

1042
01:03:14,759 --> 01:03:15,759
Okay.

1043
01:03:20,199 --> 01:03:21,229
I hope I didn't make you wait long.

1044
01:03:21,230 --> 01:03:22,630
Was it tricky to find this place?

1045
01:03:22,900 --> 01:03:25,170
I didn't wait long, and it was easy to find.

1046
01:03:25,940 --> 01:03:27,139
You must've gotten caught in the rain.

1047
01:03:28,369 --> 01:03:29,369
Only briefly.

1048
01:03:29,810 --> 01:03:30,969
Did you have some of it?

1049
01:03:31,940 --> 01:03:33,409
You can cut right to the chase.

1050
01:03:37,650 --> 01:03:40,179
You have a way of shocking someone.

1051
01:03:41,250 --> 01:03:42,488
I may not seem like it,

1052
01:03:42,489 --> 01:03:44,219
but I gave someone the best moment of her life.

1053
01:03:44,719 --> 01:03:46,690
- Enough with the jokes. - I'm not joking.

1054
01:03:47,520 --> 01:03:49,889
You didn't teach me to be a fool who took his life as a joke.

1055
01:03:52,130 --> 01:03:53,400
So this is what you really want?

1056
01:03:54,699 --> 01:03:56,569
How many times must I say it for you to believe me?

1057
01:03:57,170 --> 01:03:58,699
I made up my mind a few weeks back,

1058
01:03:59,000 --> 01:04:00,940
and I put in the time to study.

1059
01:04:01,040 --> 01:04:02,139
I'm expecting a perfect score.

1060
01:04:08,179 --> 01:04:09,949
- Are you saying you resigned... - I did.

1061
01:04:10,449 --> 01:04:11,750
My resignation is being processed.

1062
01:04:19,719 --> 01:04:21,060
Was corporate life not treating you well?

1063
01:04:22,029 --> 01:04:23,790
- It wasn't like that. - Be honest with me.

1064
01:04:24,230 --> 01:04:25,500
You can tell me anything.

1065
01:04:27,360 --> 01:04:28,369
You want honesty?

1066
01:04:29,330 --> 01:04:31,540
This isn't a job interview, so I'll give it to you.

1067
01:04:33,040 --> 01:04:34,139
Over the next ten years,

1068
01:04:34,810 --> 01:04:37,810
I wanted to earn a ton of more money than I would've at my previous job.

1069
01:04:40,040 --> 01:04:41,810
- And? - That's it. The end.

1070
01:04:43,679 --> 01:04:45,750
Money? That's your goal?

1071
01:04:46,719 --> 01:04:47,920
Does one need another reason?

1072
01:04:50,250 --> 01:04:51,389
How stupid are you?

1073
01:04:52,460 --> 01:04:53,488
Where do you live?

1074
01:04:53,489 --> 01:04:55,329
Don't you know what it means to live in Gangnam?

1075
01:04:55,330 --> 01:04:57,989
Of course, Ms. Seo. You went right for the jugular.

1076
01:04:59,699 --> 01:05:01,699
All that isn't mine. It's my parents' money.

1077
01:05:26,589 --> 01:05:27,619
Hey.

1078
01:05:30,529 --> 01:05:31,799
Ms. Oh Jung Hwa.

1079
01:05:34,259 --> 01:05:36,068
Sleep properly in your own bed.

1080
01:05:36,069 --> 01:05:37,270
What are you doing out here?

1081
01:05:44,469 --> 01:05:46,440
I was waiting for our son to come home.

1082
01:05:47,040 --> 01:05:48,509
Is he still not home?

1083
01:05:48,850 --> 01:05:50,609
There's nothing good...

1084
01:05:50,610 --> 01:05:53,080
about one coming home after work at a given time.

1085
01:05:54,020 --> 01:05:55,689
I hear companies...

1086
01:05:55,690 --> 01:05:57,690
don't have as many team dinners as they used to.

1087
01:06:00,159 --> 01:06:02,860
The news can't teach you everything about corporate life.

1088
01:06:05,630 --> 01:06:07,560
Why are you giving me attitude in the middle of the night?

1089
01:06:09,529 --> 01:06:10,900
Gosh.

1090
01:06:19,610 --> 01:06:20,710
During the IMF Crisis,

1091
01:06:21,080 --> 01:06:22,749
my dad came to purchase an apartment unit in Daechi-dong,

1092
01:06:22,750 --> 01:06:24,509
and that cost him a lifetime's worth of luck.

1093
01:06:25,319 --> 01:06:26,349
The money he earned...

1094
01:06:26,350 --> 01:06:27,749
went into educating his three children.

1095
01:06:27,750 --> 01:06:30,118
Me and my siblings have nothing to inherit,

1096
01:06:30,119 --> 01:06:31,350
and it's not something we've been seeking.

1097
01:06:32,489 --> 01:06:35,159
Hear me out. You graduated a prestigious university...

1098
01:06:35,589 --> 01:06:37,989
and got a job at a company everyone wants to work at.

1099
01:06:38,360 --> 01:06:39,400
Fine.

1100
01:06:39,630 --> 01:06:42,068
We'll say your parents' money isn't solely yours to inherit.

1101
01:06:42,069 --> 01:06:43,100
Still,

1102
01:06:43,600 --> 01:06:45,940
you're not desperate to the point that required uncanny measures.

1103
01:06:46,239 --> 01:06:47,599
The pointers I have for getting into a good college...

1104
01:06:47,600 --> 01:06:48,739
was going to waste,

1105
01:06:48,940 --> 01:06:50,368
and the company everyone wants to work at...

1106
01:06:50,369 --> 01:06:52,880
doesn't allow me to fully spread my wings.

1107
01:06:53,080 --> 01:06:54,139
But most importantly,

1108
01:06:54,980 --> 01:06:56,049
my parents' money not being mine...

1109
01:06:56,480 --> 01:06:58,049
is the focus here.

1110
01:06:58,319 --> 01:06:59,778
People will call you insane.

1111
01:06:59,779 --> 01:07:03,190
I'm saying that I can't earn money at the same pace they do.

1112
01:07:03,250 --> 01:07:04,448
There are other options.

1113
01:07:04,449 --> 01:07:07,158
Dive into academics again and pursue a specialized job.

1114
01:07:07,159 --> 01:07:09,460
That's what I did. I chose a specialized job.

1115
01:07:09,790 --> 01:07:12,028
What they say about star academy instructors online...

1116
01:07:12,029 --> 01:07:13,360
is all a lie.

1117
01:07:13,429 --> 01:07:14,459
That luxurious life only applies...

1118
01:07:14,460 --> 01:07:16,569
to about a half of a handful of people.

1119
01:07:17,400 --> 01:07:18,440
I know I can do it.

1120
01:07:19,369 --> 01:07:21,069
My score was at the eighth class after my first mock exam.

1121
01:07:21,509 --> 01:07:23,639
Remember how short it took for my score to reach first class?

1122
01:07:24,170 --> 01:07:26,509
Who else but me can be a better instructor?

1123
01:07:27,080 --> 01:07:28,508
Studying the subject and teaching it...

1124
01:07:28,509 --> 01:07:29,949
are two different things.

1125
01:07:30,150 --> 01:07:31,549
As if I don't know that.

1126
01:07:32,679 --> 01:07:34,779
That's something that doesn't require your concern.

1127
01:07:36,250 --> 01:07:38,589
You taught me to be someone who studied in advance.

1128
01:07:43,830 --> 01:07:44,830
Ms. Seo,

1129
01:07:45,659 --> 01:07:48,298
I'll create another best moment for you.

1130
01:07:48,299 --> 01:07:50,199
Will you stop it with that?

1131
01:07:50,670 --> 01:07:52,139
- Why? - You...

1132
01:07:53,270 --> 01:07:54,299
Did I perhaps...

1133
01:07:55,670 --> 01:07:57,540
- Were you an influence? - Yes.

1134
01:07:57,940 --> 01:08:00,279
A huge influence, actually.

1135
01:08:00,310 --> 01:08:01,949
Darn it.

1136
01:08:02,949 --> 01:08:05,480
There are more than enough academies in Daechi-dong,

1137
01:08:05,750 --> 01:08:08,219
so not hiring me at yours won't do a thing.

1138
01:08:08,750 --> 01:08:10,089
I want you to rethink this.

1139
01:08:10,850 --> 01:08:12,059
I have thought about it enough.

1140
01:08:12,060 --> 01:08:14,189
This job robs you of your evenings and weekends.

1141
01:08:14,190 --> 01:08:15,388
You can't even attend events for families and friends.

1142
01:08:15,389 --> 01:08:16,859
I don't need to enjoy my evenings or weekends.

1143
01:08:16,860 --> 01:08:18,758
And people prefer monetary gifts over actual attendance.

1144
01:08:18,759 --> 01:08:20,029
You can say goodbye to a love life.

1145
01:08:22,299 --> 01:08:23,429
That truly...

1146
01:08:24,530 --> 01:08:25,570
is none of your business.

1147
01:08:38,480 --> 01:08:42,490
(Night Flight)

1148
01:08:52,259 --> 01:08:54,629
Did you come up with the questions? They were quite tough.

1149
01:08:58,070 --> 01:08:59,440
Have you told your parents?

1150
01:09:00,770 --> 01:09:01,839
I should get around to that.

1151
01:09:02,270 --> 01:09:03,440
What do you think they'll say?

1152
01:09:03,610 --> 01:09:05,209
What others think isn't important.

1153
01:09:05,839 --> 01:09:07,139
Do you think you can persuade them?

1154
01:09:07,339 --> 01:09:08,810
- Of course. - How?

1155
01:09:09,410 --> 01:09:10,810
I just took a mock exam.

1156
01:09:11,509 --> 01:09:12,820
Its difficulty level was low-intermediate...

1157
01:09:13,150 --> 01:09:14,219
with no killer questions.

1158
01:09:19,620 --> 01:09:21,389
- Ms. Seo. - What?

1159
01:09:22,730 --> 01:09:23,889
Address me the same way.

1160
01:09:25,660 --> 01:09:26,660
What?

1161
01:09:27,060 --> 01:09:28,700
Refer to me as an instructor too.

1162
01:09:31,639 --> 01:09:32,999
I bet it'll feel amazing.

1163
01:10:04,329 --> 01:10:07,999
(The Midnight Romance in Hagwon)

1164
01:10:08,410 --> 01:10:09,739
Don't tell me that's what you meant by the vein of gold...

1165
01:10:09,740 --> 01:10:10,770
that never runs dry.

1166
01:10:11,039 --> 01:10:12,439
I was hoping you'd reject him.

1167
01:10:12,440 --> 01:10:15,410
How can I let my student throw a childish tantrum?

1168
01:10:15,610 --> 01:10:16,610
I handed in my resignation.

1169
01:10:16,610 --> 01:10:17,610
You didn't even work there for a long time!

1170
01:10:17,611 --> 01:10:19,249
How dare you talk to me about such a vulgar thing?

1171
01:10:19,280 --> 01:10:21,019
You need experience in this field...

1172
01:10:21,020 --> 01:10:22,649
to be offered a hefty salary.

1173
01:10:22,650 --> 01:10:24,350
What? Jun Ho's here?

1174
01:10:25,060 --> 01:10:27,060
- Jun Ho, seriously? - Leave my classroom.

1175
01:10:27,219 --> 01:10:28,219
I lied.

1176
01:10:28,220 --> 01:10:30,190
Teachers like me are a dime a dozen in Daechi-dong.

1177
01:10:30,389 --> 01:10:31,389
Ms. Seo!

1178
01:10:31,490 --> 01:10:32,799
Gosh. That was embarrassing.

1179
01:10:33,429 --> 01:10:36,030
But why do you act like a teacher?

1180
01:10:37,299 --> 01:10:38,499
Don't you think you're crossing the line?
