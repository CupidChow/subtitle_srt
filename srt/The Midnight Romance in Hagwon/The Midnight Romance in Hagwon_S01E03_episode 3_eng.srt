 Episode 3 

14
00:00:46,900 --> 00:00:49,080
 The ad won't be everything. 

15
00:00:49,080 --> 00:00:52,500
 Don't forget that the best ad is your ability and word of mouth. 

16
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:54,900
Yes. I'll do my best.

17
00:00:54,900 --> 00:00:56,720
Thank you.

18
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:07,520
How about this, by the way?

19
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:10,000
 Daechi-Chase

"Teacher-Pupil Tag Team."

21
00:01:13,120 --> 00:01:15,610
The miraculous teacher and student.

22
00:01:15,610 --> 00:01:18,280
I think that'd be a more moving story.

23
00:01:19,050 --> 00:01:27,970


24
00:01:29,440 --> 00:01:34,160
Looks like we have more to talk about.

25
00:01:37,930 --> 00:01:40,320
Could you tell me more in detail?

26
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:44,990
I heard in academies that you share a limited amount of pie.

27
00:01:44,990 --> 00:01:47,380
Since there's a fixed number of students.

28
00:01:47,380 --> 00:01:49,230
And the number is going down every year, too.

29
00:01:49,230 --> 00:01:52,030
Rather than fighting over a tiny pie,

30
00:01:52,030 --> 00:01:55,960
making the pie bigger would be a lot better.

31
00:01:55,960 --> 00:01:58,870
And you need Seo Hye Jin for that?

32
00:01:58,870 --> 00:02:04,530
The biggest lecture room was about this big when I first came here.

33
00:02:04,530 --> 00:02:08,400
It was. The desks and chairs were all used, too.

34
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:12,360
You and Ms. Seo achieved this much.

35
00:02:15,670 --> 00:02:18,670
What if she thinks you're doing it out of pity?

36
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:25,620
If you say yes, I'll find a way to convince her.

37
00:02:25,620 --> 00:02:28,940
I'll make sure it's a deal, not pity.

38
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:37,800
I'll be waiting for good news.

39
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:39,170
Okay.

40
00:02:39,170 --> 00:02:41,160
The finals are coming up soon.

41
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:43,900
All the academies go into all-out war mode.

42
00:02:43,900 --> 00:02:48,270
- Before that—
 - Let's prepare the battle line as soon as possible.

43
00:02:48,270 --> 00:02:50,110
Got it.

44
00:03:01,770 --> 00:03:07,290
 Although looking for the barracks... 

45
00:03:07,290 --> 00:03:10,520
Will Chanyeong High really not have a supplementary textbook?

46
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:14,370
Their teacher doesn't want it. What can we do?

47
00:03:15,310 --> 00:03:19,590
The academies summarizing the students' notes is bad, too.

48
00:03:19,590 --> 00:03:24,220
How sad. I'm maintaining the highest number of Chanyeong students with this.

49
00:03:24,220 --> 00:03:25,930
Take it easy.

50
00:03:25,930 --> 00:03:30,250
Our wrists, voices, and specialized skills are all disposable.

51
00:03:30,250 --> 00:03:33,350
Our life span is short for a reason.

52
00:03:33,350 --> 00:03:35,660
Thank you for your concern.

53
00:03:58,130 --> 00:03:59,510
Team Leader.

54
00:03:59,510 --> 00:04:01,710
Yes?

55
00:04:01,710 --> 00:04:03,290
I need to discuss something with you.

56
00:04:03,290 --> 00:04:05,370
Go ahead and tell me.

57
00:04:08,060 --> 00:04:09,910
Could we go somewhere for a moment?

58
00:04:12,430 --> 00:04:14,170
How about the conference room?

59
00:04:14,170 --> 00:04:15,610
Sounds good.

60
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:27,750
Why did you say what I didn't ask you to?

61
00:04:27,750 --> 00:04:30,960
I just didn't feel like taking your spot.

62
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:32,990
He explained the reason, you said.

63
00:04:32,990 --> 00:04:34,820
He was just following his instinct.

64
00:04:34,820 --> 00:04:40,420
Other teachers will think I'm privileged without a reason.

65
00:04:41,300 --> 00:04:44,380
So you'll use me as a shield?

66
00:04:44,380 --> 00:04:47,870
To be specific, it's a strategic partnership.

67
00:04:47,870 --> 00:04:50,800
- I'll say no. 
 - Of course.

68
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:53,800
Academy ads aren't that effective, anyway.

69
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:55,160
It's just symbolic.

70
00:04:55,160 --> 00:04:58,610
The people who couldn't bring results say that, don't they?

71
00:05:02,340 --> 00:05:04,220
Don't take it too far.

72
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:10,050
You think I have no self-esteem because I told you to do whatever?

73
00:05:10,050 --> 00:05:13,730
- Ms. Seo, it's not like that.
 - Did you think I'd say yes to that immediately?

74
00:05:13,730 --> 00:05:16,830
- I knew it wouldn't be immediate.
 - But?

75
00:05:16,830 --> 00:05:19,280
I thought you'd choose the benefit over your pride.

76
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:22,480
Unemotionally. Like just now.

77
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:24,800
What did I do just now?

78
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:26,600
You weren't surprised.

79
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:30,140
Even though I just said your face would be removed.

80
00:05:30,140 --> 00:05:33,900
I told you. You and I need to compete with each other.

81
00:05:33,900 --> 00:05:36,520
Don't be like that and reconsider it, please?

82
00:05:36,520 --> 00:05:38,090
You reconsider it.

83
00:05:38,090 --> 00:05:41,570
Seizing the opportunity when it comes is a talent, too.

84
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:01,740
What?

85
00:06:01,740 --> 00:06:04,120
I just need to find a way, right?

86
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:06,700
A way to benefit us both.

87
00:06:06,700 --> 00:06:10,250
You'll do it if I find it, okay?

88
00:06:10,250 --> 00:06:11,580
I said you don't have to do this.

89
00:06:11,580 --> 00:06:13,720
Promise me. This is your specialty.

90
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:16,370
"I'll let you go home if you solve this." Something like that.

91
00:06:16,370 --> 00:06:18,530
Find it, then.

92
00:06:18,530 --> 00:06:20,220
You promised.

93
00:06:20,220 --> 00:06:22,520
You promise me one thing, too.

94
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:23,950
Ask anything.

95
00:06:23,950 --> 00:06:25,760
The finals special lecture is coming up soon.

96
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:28,990
I don't have time to waste energy with you.

97
00:06:28,990 --> 00:06:30,770
You have until tomorrow.

98
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:34,390
Sounds good.

99
00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:43,190
Here.

100
00:06:43,190 --> 00:06:45,080
Thank you.

101
00:06:47,460 --> 00:06:52,510
I thought I'd see you much later since you don't have classes yet.

102
00:06:53,140 --> 00:06:55,790
I've never worked in this neighborhood before.

103
00:06:55,790 --> 00:06:59,430
I was wondering if I could get advice from you.

104
00:06:59,430 --> 00:07:02,850
I heard the counseling managers are experienced and well-informed.

105
00:07:02,850 --> 00:07:04,970
Where did you hear such a thing?

106
00:07:04,970 --> 00:07:07,110
From an internet forum.

107
00:07:12,300 --> 00:07:14,060
Is that so?

108
00:07:15,370 --> 00:07:19,000
What kind of advice do you want?

109
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:25,420
Well... to be honest, I have a bit of a disadvantage.

110
00:07:25,420 --> 00:07:30,150
I didn't attend a *SKY university, and I never worked around here, either.  (*Seoul National, Korea, and Yonsei) 

111
00:07:30,150 --> 00:07:33,480
But you joined by winning in a tight competition.

112
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:35,840
Be confident.

113
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:41,110
The director pulled Mr. Lee aside and had a one-on-one meeting with him.

114
00:07:42,930 --> 00:07:45,700
You must be a bit upset about it.

115
00:07:45,700 --> 00:07:49,060
I want to prove my abilities quickly.

116
00:07:49,060 --> 00:07:51,300
What should I do?

117
00:07:53,770 --> 00:07:58,460
I didn't think I'd be hearing such a naive question in Daechi.

118
00:07:58,460 --> 00:08:02,140
I'm sure I won't fall behind in terms of my abilities.

119
00:08:02,140 --> 00:08:07,670
Since the question is naive, I'll answer naively, too.

120
00:08:07,670 --> 00:08:11,120
Bring results in a short period of time.

121
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:15,870
So... How, exactly?

122
00:08:15,870 --> 00:08:19,310
I would be a lecturer if I knew that.

123
00:08:56,900 --> 00:09:00,600

128
00:10:41,700 --> 00:10:43,780
 We... 

129
00:10:43,780 --> 00:10:46,480
 understand each other's position well. 

130
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:01,420
Aren't you going home?

131
00:11:01,420 --> 00:11:04,320
I thought the Korean department would have dinner since you didn't have classes.

132
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:06,490
I still have work to do.

133
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:10,480
Let's go home.

134
00:11:11,330 --> 00:11:14,200
You can go ahead. I'll wrap things up here.

135
00:11:17,590 --> 00:11:20,070
Did Jun Ho go somewhere?

136
00:11:20,070 --> 00:11:22,570
Looks like he hasn't left yet, either.

137
00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:47,360
Aren't you going home?

138
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:48,960
Aren't you hungry?

139
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:50,970
I'm glad you're here, Ms. Seo.

140
00:11:50,970 --> 00:11:52,810
Just one second.

141
00:11:53,910 --> 00:11:55,870
Have a seat here.

142
00:12:05,610 --> 00:12:07,770
Mr. Lee.

143
00:12:09,830 --> 00:12:11,340
Jun Ho.

144
00:12:11,340 --> 00:12:13,090
Yes, Ms. Seo.

145
00:12:15,220 --> 00:12:17,620
I'm concerned about you.

146
00:12:19,310 --> 00:12:20,810
I'm really busy right now.

147
00:12:20,810 --> 00:12:23,670
I don't have the energy to teach and mentor you.

148
00:12:23,670 --> 00:12:26,240
You don't have time to worry about stuff like this, either, do you?

149
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:28,780
You need to start your class soon.

150
00:12:30,730 --> 00:12:34,260
Just give it a try, as the Director said. It's a good opportunity.

151
00:12:34,260 --> 00:12:35,820
Let them know you're here first.

152
00:12:35,820 --> 00:12:39,070
Start with that, and starting with the summer break—

153
00:12:41,930 --> 00:12:43,820
You almost convinced me.

154
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:46,060
What?

155
00:12:46,060 --> 00:12:48,690
I'm concerned about you, too.

156
00:12:48,690 --> 00:12:51,960
- Hey— 
 - I was trying not to bother you

157
00:12:51,960 --> 00:12:53,950
and do what you told me to do.

158
00:12:53,950 --> 00:12:56,660
- But?
 - I don't want to.

159
00:12:56,660 --> 00:12:58,720
I'll do it with you, no matter what.

160
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:00,330
It'd be to my benefit.

161
00:13:00,330 --> 00:13:02,890
- Jun Ho—
 - You told me to find a way.

162
00:13:02,890 --> 00:13:04,560
I found it.

163
00:13:07,430 --> 00:13:08,950
So...

164
00:13:09,650 --> 00:13:11,900
be my partner.

165
00:13:11,900 --> 00:13:15,090
Joint curriculum, joint ad, and joint classes.

166
00:13:15,090 --> 00:13:18,600
It'd be called the "Teacher-Pupil Tag Team."

167
00:13:19,290 --> 00:13:22,540
You don't get this opportunity easily.

168
00:13:22,540 --> 00:13:24,990
I told you. You have no colleagues here.

169
00:13:24,990 --> 00:13:27,450
You said you do use each other.

170
00:13:27,450 --> 00:13:31,050
I'll say no. I already teach the most Chanyeong High students.

171
00:13:31,050 --> 00:13:32,930
But you aren't interested in stopping there.

172
00:13:32,930 --> 00:13:34,750
I can worry about myself.

173
00:13:34,750 --> 00:13:36,420
The first one...

174
00:13:42,090 --> 00:13:44,190
should be Huiwon High.

175
00:13:45,860 --> 00:13:50,890
It's an independent private boys' school that's just as stingy with grades as Chanyeong High.

176
00:13:50,890 --> 00:13:55,080
An adventure you haven't embarked on yet. To put it simply,

177
00:13:55,080 --> 00:13:57,370
it's Seo Hye Jin's Great Wall of China.

178
00:13:59,180 --> 00:14:01,830
I realized while looking at the Hall of Fame wall,

179
00:14:01,830 --> 00:14:07,530
that you focus on two or sometimes three schools.

180
00:14:07,530 --> 00:14:12,010
But the Seo Hye Jin, I know, wouldn't be satisfied with that.

181
00:14:12,010 --> 00:14:14,670
You must've tried your hardest.

182
00:14:14,670 --> 00:14:16,540
And I found

183
00:14:16,540 --> 00:14:19,460
the evidence of your effort.

184
00:14:19,460 --> 00:14:20,760
What did you see?

185
00:14:20,760 --> 00:14:26,250
For the last three years, you had eight presentations for Huiwon High's parents.

186
00:14:26,250 --> 00:14:28,460
But...

187
00:14:28,460 --> 00:14:30,790
you have never been able to secure a class yet.

188
00:14:30,790 --> 00:14:34,740
Three students enrolled for the last midterm special lecture.

189
00:14:34,740 --> 00:14:37,770
You sent all of them back since you didn't reach the number.

190
00:14:37,770 --> 00:14:41,160
Do you know why I couldn't reach the number?

191
00:14:41,160 --> 00:14:45,000
Because there was a gatekeeper guarding the Great Wall.

192
00:14:47,050 --> 00:14:52,160
A legendary figure, teaching the highest number of Huiwon High students for 20 years.

193
00:14:55,450 --> 00:14:59,590
Yes. Choeseon Korean Academy

194
00:14:59,590 --> 00:15:01,760
Director Choi Hyeong Seon.

195
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:04,100
Also known as ...

196
00:15:04,100 --> 00:15:05,900
the Gray Witch.

197
00:15:10,830 --> 00:15:13,590
 A former teacher at Huiwon High became an academy lecturer. 

198
00:15:13,590 --> 00:15:16,690
 Four hundred students from Huiwon High... 

199
00:15:17,890 --> 00:15:20,800
 attend Director Choi's lectures. 

200
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:25,350
 She has never canceled a class or been late for twenty years. 

201
00:15:25,350 --> 00:15:29,380
 They call her a witch due to her chilling punctuality. 

202
00:15:33,100 --> 00:15:35,290
The test went well for all of you, right?

203
00:15:35,290 --> 00:15:36,640
 Yes, ma'am. 

204
00:15:36,640 --> 00:15:43,090
I always say this, but the school exams indicate how diligent you are.

205
00:15:43,090 --> 00:15:46,750
It's a time of opportunity, not pain.

206
00:15:46,750 --> 00:15:53,300
This is your precious opportunity to defeat the friend next to you who's read thousands of books.

207
00:15:53,300 --> 00:15:54,790
You can't miss even one question.

208
00:15:54,790 --> 00:15:56,370
 Yes, ma'am. 

209
00:15:56,370 --> 00:15:58,750
- Let's do our best today, too.
  - Yes, ma'am. 

210
00:15:58,750 --> 00:16:01,140
Textbook page 89.

211
00:16:10,110 --> 00:16:13,250
 Her monthly salary for teaching the Huiwon High classes is 
   

212
00:16:13,250 --> 00:16:16,070
 way higher than a corporate executive's annual salary. 

213
00:16:16,070 --> 00:16:21,000
 She went through many TAs, but she's been working with one for eight years. 

214
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:24,060
 Some say he's a high school graduate, and some say he has a Ph.D., 

215
00:16:24,060 --> 00:16:26,840
 but there's no way to know. 

216
00:16:26,840 --> 00:16:28,640
Where did you hear about her TA?

217
00:16:28,640 --> 00:16:32,870
I called my friend who went to Huiwon High. They all attended Choeseon Korean.

218
00:16:32,870 --> 00:16:37,360
All the prominent Korean teachers challenged her, but she didn't even budge.

219
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:41,980
Being an academy lecturer at sixty isn't as easy as it sounds.

220
00:16:41,980 --> 00:16:45,300
I know. She needs to pass the torch.

221
00:16:45,300 --> 00:16:48,590
I'm saying we can't win that school over by just changing the ad.

222
00:16:48,590 --> 00:16:50,690
But we can fire a flare, at least.

223
00:16:50,690 --> 00:16:52,770
With the "Teacher-Pupil Tag Team"?

224
00:16:53,770 --> 00:16:59,020
Teachers hold a special place in one's heart.

225
00:17:01,840 --> 00:17:03,620
Okay, fine.

226
00:17:03,620 --> 00:17:05,670
Let's say I secure a Huiwon High class.

227
00:17:05,670 --> 00:17:07,290
It's true that would be to my benefit.

228
00:17:07,290 --> 00:17:10,150
But what would you gain from it?

229
00:17:12,380 --> 00:17:14,580
An entrance like a comet.

230
00:17:15,510 --> 00:17:18,300
The rumor that I destroyed someone's castle gate.

231
00:17:18,300 --> 00:17:20,910
And I want anger from the authority.

232
00:17:20,910 --> 00:17:23,830
Anger will turn into attention, and that

233
00:17:23,830 --> 00:17:26,930
will hold immeasurable value.

234
00:17:40,040 --> 00:17:41,580
What do you say?

235
00:17:42,470 --> 00:17:45,300
Does that make your concern worthwhile?

236
00:17:50,690 --> 00:17:52,310
It does.

237
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:25,210
We'll accept enrollment for the finals with this schedule.

238
00:18:31,660 --> 00:18:33,560
It hasn't changed much compared to the midterm?

239
00:18:33,560 --> 00:18:37,140
No. All the teachers are focusing on the main schools.

240
00:18:37,140 --> 00:18:41,770
This is why they're satisfied with making 10 million a month.

241
00:18:44,040 --> 00:18:46,380
Don't you know there's a change at Chanyeong High?

242
00:18:46,380 --> 00:18:49,650
Analyzing previous exams is useless now.

243
00:18:49,650 --> 00:18:53,860
That's why Mr. Lee Ui Jung had a big presentation for parents—

244
00:18:53,860 --> 00:18:56,470
Will Mr. Lee be enough?

245
00:18:56,470 --> 00:18:59,260
Next year's business depends on this.

246
00:19:00,390 --> 00:19:04,350
It's a bit late to hire a new teacher.

247
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,700
I'll be in charge of that.

248
00:19:15,700 --> 00:19:16,950
Pardon?

249
00:19:17,690 --> 00:19:22,080
Advertise in a banner saying the director is teaching the Chanyeong class.

250
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:23,450
Okay.

251
00:19:25,960 --> 00:19:27,710
When will the class start?

252
00:19:27,710 --> 00:19:31,510
Seo Hye Jin will start six weeks before the exam.

253
00:19:33,610 --> 00:19:35,320
Seo Hye Jin?

254
00:19:35,320 --> 00:19:36,740
Yes.

255
00:19:41,150 --> 00:19:43,680
We'll start on the same date.

256
00:19:44,510 --> 00:19:47,440
How about a week before?

257
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:49,490
That would be more advantageous—

258
00:19:49,490 --> 00:19:51,710
The same date.

259
00:19:52,730 --> 00:19:55,910
Okay, got it.

260
00:19:57,860 --> 00:20:01,040
More than half of Huiwon High students earn over 90 points for Korean.

261
00:20:01,040 --> 00:20:04,460
They get pushed to Level 4 by answering two questions wrong.

262
00:20:04,460 --> 00:20:08,160
They're very well educated, but they're too sensitive.

263
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:10,190
That's my specialty.

264
00:20:10,190 --> 00:20:13,640
You know. It's easy to go up from 10 points to 60,

265
00:20:13,640 --> 00:20:16,490
but going down from 100 to 90 is...

266
00:20:16,490 --> 00:20:19,110
There's no need to explain. It makes you want to die.

267
00:20:19,110 --> 00:20:20,440
Did you want to die?

268
00:20:20,440 --> 00:20:23,460
I simply no longer felt human.

269
00:20:23,460 --> 00:20:26,450
It gets harder to study as the grades get higher.

270
00:20:26,450 --> 00:20:29,360
And each friend feels like a wall.

271
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:31,250
I didn't know.

272
00:20:31,250 --> 00:20:32,890
I was acting tough.

273
00:20:32,890 --> 00:20:36,270
You'd look foolish if you acted desperately.

274
00:20:38,520 --> 00:20:40,930
But I was okay.

275
00:20:40,930 --> 00:20:43,360
Because I had you.

276
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:45,400
The ad by itself won't be enough.

277
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:48,210
We need another powerful blow.

278
00:20:48,210 --> 00:20:49,750
I know.

279
00:20:52,270 --> 00:20:54,790
Recruiting the kids is the first step.

280
00:20:54,790 --> 00:20:58,740
Securing the class, a textbook to expand on, and enhancing lecturing skills would be the second.

281
00:20:58,740 --> 00:21:00,900
They both would be difficult.

282
00:21:00,900 --> 00:21:03,180
I'm prepared.

283
00:21:05,010 --> 00:21:08,880
Keep your schedule empty from 10 to 12 p.m. every day for a while.

284
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:13,640
Will you join me?

285
00:21:13,640 --> 00:21:19,060
I never gave a joint lecture while prepping for an exam.

286
00:21:19,060 --> 00:21:21,750
But I think we could garner attention for that.

287
00:21:22,650 --> 00:21:26,180
I'll make sure you don't regret it.

288
00:21:27,180 --> 00:21:30,420
It's over if the lecturers' levels don't match. We'll both go down together.

289
00:21:30,420 --> 00:21:32,650
That will never happen. Never.

290
00:21:32,650 --> 00:21:35,510
Excuse me, I just warned you.

291
00:21:35,510 --> 00:21:37,630
Don't hold me back.

292
00:21:38,620 --> 00:21:39,880
Okay?

293
00:21:39,880 --> 00:21:42,520
Pardon? Okay, okay.

294
00:21:42,520 --> 00:21:44,470
You'll be teaching them to death, anyway.

295
00:21:44,470 --> 00:21:47,400
You probably won't send them home like you used to.

296
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:51,480
Hey, shouldn't you be thanking me first?

297
00:21:51,480 --> 00:21:54,060
I won't return the favor with words.

298
00:21:54,060 --> 00:21:55,460
What, then?

299
00:21:55,460 --> 00:21:59,020
Wealth, glorious reputation,

300
00:21:59,020 --> 00:22:02,980
and the memory of victory that you'll take to the grave. I'll give you that.

301
00:22:05,300 --> 00:22:09,670
I wish you were less eloquent.

302
00:22:09,670 --> 00:22:11,550
I know.

303
00:22:11,550 --> 00:22:14,290
You taught me too well.

304
00:22:38,300 --> 00:22:40,470
Hold on.

305
00:22:40,470 --> 00:22:42,750
Right,

306
00:22:42,750 --> 00:22:46,530
here. Look through them for now. They'll be useful.

307
00:22:46,530 --> 00:22:49,800
Okay. Text me when you get home.

308
00:22:49,800 --> 00:22:52,630
No. Isn't it scarier to text you at night?

309
00:22:52,630 --> 00:22:54,860
But still, text me.

310
00:22:54,860 --> 00:22:56,640
Okay. See you.

311
00:22:56,640 --> 00:22:59,520
Oh, there's something I didn't get to tell you.

312
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:00,950
What is it?

313
00:23:00,950 --> 00:23:03,000
I'm getting my own place soon.

314
00:23:03,700 --> 00:23:05,750
Did you get kicked out?

315
00:23:05,750 --> 00:23:07,740
I'm going independent.

316
00:23:09,130 --> 00:23:12,460
But I can't get an apartment in this neighborhood with my savings.

317
00:23:12,460 --> 00:23:14,930
I lost my mind visiting real estate agencies.

318
00:23:14,930 --> 00:23:18,040
- So?
 - I'm looking for a place in your neighborhood.

319
00:23:18,040 --> 00:23:19,250
Why?

320
00:23:19,250 --> 00:23:20,770
It's cheaper than here and...

321
00:23:20,770 --> 00:23:23,450
it'd be easier to share a ride.

322
00:23:23,450 --> 00:23:27,020
I can't afford a car after paying the security deposit.

323
00:23:28,420 --> 00:23:30,220
Anyway, I warned you.

Can't handle him.

369
00:28:13,160 --> 00:28:15,180
Gosh, look who's here.

370
00:28:15,180 --> 00:28:16,760
It's Director Choi.

371
00:28:16,760 --> 00:28:18,550
Long time no see, Director Kim.

372
00:28:18,550 --> 00:28:19,830
What brings you here?

373
00:28:19,830 --> 00:28:22,740
You rarely come to the directors' gatherings.

374
00:28:22,740 --> 00:28:25,930
Maybe it's because I'm not skilled at running an academy.

375
00:28:25,930 --> 00:28:29,600
I couldn't come because I've been buried in lectures.

376
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:31,480
I envy you for many reasons.

377
00:28:31,480 --> 00:28:33,880
- Shall we go in?
 - Let's.

378
00:28:49,080 --> 00:28:52,360
Here are the final lecture schedules of major subject-focused academies

379
00:28:52,360 --> 00:28:55,210
and math academies.

380
00:28:55,210 --> 00:28:57,610
Since we can't overlap with the math classes,

381
00:28:57,610 --> 00:29:00,320
use this as a reference for the finals prep.

382
00:29:00,320 --> 00:29:02,720
Math is such a problem.

383
00:29:03,370 --> 00:29:06,300
It's not too different than the midterm.

384
00:29:06,300 --> 00:29:12,820
Can I assume your schedules haven't changed since the midterm?

385
00:29:12,820 --> 00:29:17,940
We'll take Wednesdays off and teach the same schools as usual.

386
00:29:17,940 --> 00:29:19,150
Sounds good.

387
00:29:19,150 --> 00:29:21,510
Great.

388
00:29:21,510 --> 00:29:25,460
I think our schedule will change a bit.

389
00:29:25,460 --> 00:29:28,100
Are you teaching more Huiwon High students?

390
00:29:28,800 --> 00:29:31,950
It's not that. I...

391
00:29:35,350 --> 00:29:38,530
am thinking of starting a Chanyeong High class.

392
00:29:40,570 --> 00:29:42,160
You'll give lectures live?

393
00:29:42,160 --> 00:29:44,440
They changed their exam system

394
00:29:44,440 --> 00:29:48,450
and we need to prepare to teach future 10th-graders, too.

395
00:29:48,450 --> 00:29:50,350
We're receiving a lot of inquiries.

396
00:29:50,350 --> 00:29:55,810
Director Ju, you hired a teacher from a major academy, I heard.

397
00:29:55,810 --> 00:30:00,420
The rumors spread quickly in Daechi-dong.

398
00:30:01,160 --> 00:30:05,220
Chanyeong High students are so fortunate.

399
00:30:07,500 --> 00:30:10,820
Ms. Seo is so talented.

400
00:30:10,820 --> 00:30:14,570
We're all just challengers, including myself.

401
00:30:44,680 --> 00:30:49,290
 Residence / Business / Studios 

402
00:30:50,670 --> 00:30:55,930
 Monthly lease: 1 million. Deposit for a studio: 50 million 

403
00:30:59,190 --> 00:31:00,950
Yes, Director.

404
00:31:01,920 --> 00:31:04,100
I'm on my way to work.

405
00:31:05,590 --> 00:31:08,000
Yes, it'll take about 30 minutes.

406
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:09,600
Okay.

407
00:31:14,600 --> 00:31:17,060
As you asked, the presentation for the parents will be

408
00:31:17,060 --> 00:31:19,890
in two parts, Part 1 for Huiwon and Part 2 for Chanyeong.

409
00:31:19,890 --> 00:31:21,980
The announcement texts have been sent.

410
00:31:21,980 --> 00:31:26,020
I reserved the hotel catering service you mentioned, too.

411
00:31:26,020 --> 00:31:30,140
Fifty seats will be available, and it'll be first come, first serve.

412
00:31:30,140 --> 00:31:33,830
I'd like about 30 people instead.

413
00:31:33,830 --> 00:31:36,050
I'm worried there'll be more.

414
00:31:36,050 --> 00:31:39,030
I don't want it to be too taxing for you.

415
00:31:56,170 --> 00:31:57,970
Yes.

416
00:32:01,470 --> 00:32:03,210
Director, here's what you requested.

417
00:32:03,210 --> 00:32:04,980
Thank you.

418
00:32:05,890 --> 00:32:08,610
If you're feeling very ill, go see a doctor.

419
00:32:08,610 --> 00:32:11,070
No, I'm okay. You can leave.

420
00:32:11,070 --> 00:32:12,540
Okay.

421
00:32:20,100 --> 00:32:25,210
I'm glad Ms. Seo accepted Mr. Lee's suggestion.

422
00:32:25,210 --> 00:32:27,140
It's a great concept.

423
00:32:27,140 --> 00:32:29,200
It is, but...

424
00:32:30,560 --> 00:32:33,560
something unexpected happened.

425
00:32:35,350 --> 00:32:41,270
Choeseon Korean's director will be teaching a live class for Chanyeong High.

426
00:32:44,230 --> 00:32:46,730
Choeseon Korean.

427
00:32:46,730 --> 00:32:48,760
You mean that Gray Witch?

428
00:32:49,870 --> 00:32:54,970
Since Ms. Seo had the highest enrollment from Chanyeong High for over seven years,

429
00:32:54,970 --> 00:32:57,770
we won't get defeated so easily, but

430
00:32:57,770 --> 00:33:01,420
to be honest, I feel anxious... uncomfortable.

431
00:33:01,420 --> 00:33:03,290
I'm sorry.

432
00:33:03,290 --> 00:33:05,180
Geez.

433
00:33:11,530 --> 00:33:15,290
Postpone the new ad campaign

434
00:33:15,290 --> 00:33:17,480
and secure Chanyeong High for now.

435
00:33:17,480 --> 00:33:19,620
Yes, sounds good. I don't mind.

436
00:33:19,620 --> 00:33:21,130
No.

437
00:33:23,090 --> 00:33:25,290
Our goal isn't to secure what we have.

438
00:33:25,290 --> 00:33:26,880
Get home safely, then.

439
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:29,330
- She's in your care.
 - See you, Chae Won.

440
00:33:29,330 --> 00:33:31,980
- Take care. 
- Bye.

441
00:33:37,360 --> 00:33:40,740
I earned my share today, too.

442
00:33:41,820 --> 00:33:44,950
You were born to do this. Seriously.

443
00:33:44,950 --> 00:33:47,210
I'm basically a shaman, you know.

444
00:33:47,210 --> 00:33:51,020
I know exactly where they want to be scratched.

445
00:33:51,020 --> 00:33:53,320
Gosh, you'll go independent soon.

446
00:33:53,320 --> 00:33:55,240
Come on.

447
00:33:55,240 --> 00:33:59,460
Think carefully. Being on a salary is easier.

448
00:34:01,310 --> 00:34:05,140
An argument breaks out somewhere, and someone wants to quit all the time.

449
00:34:05,140 --> 00:34:08,250
Being a director isn't worth it.

450
00:34:08,250 --> 00:34:09,720
Is something going on?

451
00:34:09,720 --> 00:34:11,460
I wouldn't know.

452
00:34:13,300 --> 00:34:17,490
By the way, things are getting serious in the director's office.

453
00:34:17,490 --> 00:34:21,450
He's talking to Ms. Seo and Mr. Lee.

454
00:34:22,650 --> 00:34:24,990
Huiwon High.

455
00:34:28,470 --> 00:34:33,430
And you aren't trying to collect the students Director Choi shed.

456
00:34:33,430 --> 00:34:36,520
We need to steal Gray Witch's students.

457
00:34:36,520 --> 00:34:38,470
Starting with 10th-graders.

458
00:34:44,070 --> 00:34:48,810
If this works, the academy directors in Daechi-dong will flip out.

459
00:34:48,810 --> 00:34:50,730
That's what we're hoping for.

460
00:34:57,670 --> 00:34:59,430
Sit side by side.

461
00:35:00,410 --> 00:35:02,050
Sit next to him.

462
00:35:04,750 --> 00:35:07,520
Closer. Closer.

463
00:35:08,370 --> 00:35:09,880
Get close.

464
00:35:11,790 --> 00:35:13,390
Be affectionate.

465
00:35:14,680 --> 00:35:16,280
Be affectionate.

466
00:35:20,720 --> 00:35:24,810
Will the teacher and student concept be explosive enough?

467
00:35:24,810 --> 00:35:26,800
We'll have to make it explosive.

468
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:28,400
How?

469
00:35:31,110 --> 00:35:34,460
Give Director Choi Hyeong Seon a call first.

470
00:35:34,460 --> 00:35:37,950
Call Gray Witch? Why would I?

471
00:35:37,950 --> 00:35:40,580
Just tell her that...

472
00:35:41,380 --> 00:35:43,320
I'm scared.

473
00:35:43,320 --> 00:35:45,910
Their rule is to base the exam on the textbook.

474
00:35:45,910 --> 00:35:50,930
Choeseon Korean's famous thorough memorizing technique will work.

475
00:35:50,930 --> 00:35:52,870
For the class pace...

476
00:35:58,780 --> 00:36:01,510
Director Kim, this is Choi Hyeong Seon.

477
00:36:01,510 --> 00:36:06,250
Team Leader Seo is panicking right now.

478
00:36:07,150 --> 00:36:11,980
Going head-to-head will be too much of a headache.

479
00:36:11,980 --> 00:36:13,710
Why do you need the Gray Witch's class schedule?

480
00:36:13,710 --> 00:36:16,000
She's begging me to find out your class schedule for Chanyeong High...

481
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:21,990
I want to know if she's after Chanyeong or Seo Hye Jin's Chanyeong.

482
00:36:21,990 --> 00:36:25,290
- Oh, really?
 - Teach.

483
00:36:25,290 --> 00:36:27,470
You aren't actually scared, are you?

484
00:36:27,470 --> 00:36:30,010
- No.
 - I understand. Thank you.

485
00:36:30,010 --> 00:36:35,410
Don't apologize. It's okay. Of course.

486
00:36:35,410 --> 00:36:38,060
Thank you. Okay.

487
00:36:42,640 --> 00:36:45,300
It's as expected.

488
00:36:45,300 --> 00:36:47,260
Tuesday and Saturday evenings.

489
00:36:47,260 --> 00:36:49,530
Same time and day as Ms. Seo's class.

490
00:36:49,530 --> 00:36:51,880
She's starting on the same date, too.

491
00:36:51,880 --> 00:36:53,850
She's teaching 10th-graders, too.

492
00:36:55,440 --> 00:36:57,490
Are you smiling?

493
00:36:57,490 --> 00:37:00,390
What will you do now?

494
00:37:00,390 --> 00:37:03,990
They want to avoid going head-to-head?

495
00:37:06,840 --> 00:37:08,730
No need to get distracted by the number.

496
00:37:08,730 --> 00:37:11,040
Director Choi might be experienced,

497
00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:14,670
but our track records are the same.

498
00:37:14,670 --> 00:37:16,990
So as the lecture skills, name recognition, textbook quality,

499
00:37:16,990 --> 00:37:19,570
and the students' level of education.

500
00:37:19,570 --> 00:37:21,860
You can't change any of these overnight.

501
00:37:21,860 --> 00:37:25,420
But there's one thing you can change freely.

502
00:37:25,420 --> 00:37:27,900
- The dates?
 - Yes.

503
00:37:27,900 --> 00:37:32,590
 Tuesday and Saturday nights. 

504
00:37:33,450 --> 00:37:35,820
Except for the dates Huiwon High has classes on,

505
00:37:35,820 --> 00:37:40,280
there are eight to ten-time slots she can choose from.

506
00:37:40,280 --> 00:37:43,230
And she picked Tuesdays and Saturdays.

507
00:37:43,230 --> 00:37:48,410
The same time as my class, even.

508
00:37:48,410 --> 00:37:49,710
You said you were scared because ...

509
00:37:49,710 --> 00:37:53,570
If I were to go all-in on the Chanyeong class since I got scared,

510
00:37:53,570 --> 00:37:56,550
I'd definitely move the class to Wednesday and Sunday nights.

511
00:37:56,550 --> 00:38:01,550
Because she's been using that time slot for Huiwon High students for 20 years,

512
00:38:01,550 --> 00:38:03,980
that's the safest timeslot.

513
00:38:03,980 --> 00:38:08,130
Since she thinks you're scared, she'll switch the class schedule

514
00:38:08,130 --> 00:38:11,760
and teach the Chanyeong class on Wednesday and Sunday nights

515
00:38:11,760 --> 00:38:14,390
because she's after our Chanyeong High students?

516
00:38:14,390 --> 00:38:16,550
Yes, probably.

517
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:23,350
But what if she doesn't do as we predicted?

518
00:38:24,470 --> 00:38:25,830
Mr. Park.

519
00:38:25,830 --> 00:38:27,070
Yes.

520
00:38:27,070 --> 00:38:29,340
Let's change the class schedule.

521
00:38:30,650 --> 00:38:34,510
Move the Chanyeong High class to Wednesday and Sunday nights.

522
00:38:34,510 --> 00:38:37,580
But teach the Huiwon High class, then.

523
00:38:39,800 --> 00:38:45,500
I need to let them know we aren't interested in adjusting the class schedule.

524
00:38:45,500 --> 00:38:48,970
 She probably isn't interested in adjusting the class schedule. 

525
00:38:49,670 --> 00:38:54,890
We won't touch Chanyeong High class' schedule and...

526
00:38:54,890 --> 00:38:58,120
go after Director Choi's Huiwon High class?

527
00:38:58,120 --> 00:39:03,180
Yes. If she changes Huiwon High's class schedule as we expected,

528
00:39:03,180 --> 00:39:07,920
it might not be a direct blow, but it'll shake things up a bit.

529
00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:11,870
We won't confuse my Chanyeong students,

530
00:39:11,870 --> 00:39:14,240
but it'll be easier to go after Huiwon High.

531
00:39:14,240 --> 00:39:17,430
Even if Choeseon Korean doesn't move as we expected,

532
00:39:17,430 --> 00:39:19,840
we won't suffer any loss.

533
00:39:27,640 --> 00:39:29,310
That's not enough.

534
00:39:29,310 --> 00:39:33,370
Come on, the main event starts afterward.

535
00:39:33,370 --> 00:39:36,850
We have another hidden card that Director Choi doesn't know about.

536
00:39:39,780 --> 00:39:44,840
Jun Ho can use a method she'd never use.

537
00:39:44,840 --> 00:39:48,370
There's only one thing.

538
00:39:48,370 --> 00:39:52,550
Free lectures. Only new lecturers can do that.

539
00:40:01,100 --> 00:40:05,120
What do you mean? F-Free?

540
00:40:05,120 --> 00:40:10,020
Mr. Lee, we'd like to talk more alone.

541
00:40:11,610 --> 00:40:13,580
Am I not supposed to hear it?

542
00:40:13,580 --> 00:40:15,560
You're not.

543
00:40:15,560 --> 00:40:17,470
I hope you understand.

544
00:40:20,890 --> 00:40:22,330
Okay.

545
00:40:29,270 --> 00:40:30,470
- You're free tonight, right?
 - Yes.

546
00:40:30,470 --> 00:40:32,640
- I'll make a reservation, then.
 - Okay.

547
00:40:33,600 --> 00:40:36,230
Here he comes. Mr. Lee.

548
00:40:36,230 --> 00:40:37,730
Yes.

549
00:40:41,680 --> 00:40:44,230
You're free this evening, right?

550
00:40:44,230 --> 00:40:45,450
Th-This evening?

551
00:40:45,450 --> 00:40:49,340
We can't have a full-blown team dinner since everyone's schedule is different,

552
00:40:49,340 --> 00:40:52,880
but we'll have a drink with whoever's free.

553
00:40:52,880 --> 00:40:54,290
Join us.

554
00:40:54,290 --> 00:40:56,870
I made plans for tonight,

555
00:40:56,870 --> 00:40:58,530
Is it a date, by chance?

556
00:40:58,530 --> 00:41:00,650
No, it's not that.

557
00:41:00,650 --> 00:41:02,940
How many are there, then? I'll make a reservation.

558
00:41:02,940 --> 00:41:05,950
Hold on. I haven't asked Team Leader Seo yet.

559
00:41:05,950 --> 00:41:07,740
This is taking too long.

560
00:41:07,740 --> 00:41:10,900
We can add her later. I'll make a reservation for now.

561
00:41:10,900 --> 00:41:16,840
You've been considering Huiwon High since then?

562
00:41:16,840 --> 00:41:19,370
Since I wanted Jun Ho in the ad?

563
00:41:19,370 --> 00:41:25,480
I should've become a shaman instead if I saw it coming.

564
00:41:25,480 --> 00:41:26,740
I suppose.

565
00:41:26,740 --> 00:41:30,570
I didn't know he'd say something as cheeky as "Teacher-Pupil Tag Team."

566
00:41:30,570 --> 00:41:32,750
Not to mention Choeseon Korean's attack.

567
00:41:32,750 --> 00:41:36,050
I didn't see any of this coming.

568
00:41:36,050 --> 00:41:40,040
It sure is a brilliant idea, but...

569
00:41:40,040 --> 00:41:45,270
What would you have done had I kept opposing it?

570
00:41:45,270 --> 00:41:48,480
I don't know. I never thought about it.

571
00:41:48,480 --> 00:41:49,870
Why not?

572
00:41:49,870 --> 00:41:53,470
I just had a feeling Lee Jun Ho would be mine.

573
00:41:53,470 --> 00:41:55,090
It was a gut feeling.

574
00:41:58,320 --> 00:42:00,140
I have a favor to ask, Director.

575
00:42:00,140 --> 00:42:01,810
What?

576
00:42:01,810 --> 00:42:07,320
What if you put Jun Ho in the ad?

577
00:42:08,260 --> 00:42:11,350
- What's the reason?
 - Jun Ho went to Chanyeong High.

578
00:42:11,350 --> 00:42:15,970
I'll defend as much as possible, but he can be the additional defense.

579
00:42:17,100 --> 00:42:21,730
Tell everyone that Chanyeong High's miracle is here?

580
00:42:21,730 --> 00:42:24,810
It'll be effective for the average to bottom students.

581
00:42:29,410 --> 00:42:32,380
Is this what it's like to get old?

582
00:42:32,380 --> 00:42:35,120
I want to make a safe choice.

583
00:42:35,120 --> 00:42:37,860
I'm fine with keeping things the same.

584
00:42:37,860 --> 00:42:42,570
Director Choi is 60, but she's rolling up her sleeves to go after me.

585
00:42:44,230 --> 00:42:46,450
You can't just sit and defend.

586
00:42:46,450 --> 00:42:49,760
I'll train Jun Ho well.

587
00:42:54,220 --> 00:42:56,260
I have no choice but to trust you.

588
00:42:56,260 --> 00:42:58,460
Since you're Seo Hye Jin.

589
00:42:59,790 --> 00:43:02,050
And about the free lecture...

590
00:43:02,050 --> 00:43:05,670
I think we should keep it a secret until the new ad gets posted.

591
00:43:05,670 --> 00:43:08,350
We need to minimize the time for Choeseon Korean to react.

592
00:43:08,350 --> 00:43:10,630
Yes, let's do that.

593
00:43:32,220 --> 00:43:35,090
I feel uncomfortable relaying this news, too.

594
00:43:35,090 --> 00:43:40,590
The principal and vice principal are hearing about it, too.

595
00:43:40,590 --> 00:43:46,290
Looks like even the chairman heard something, too.

596
00:43:46,290 --> 00:43:49,740
You said math and science supplementary classes

597
00:43:49,740 --> 00:43:54,380
are special programs to produce creative talents.

598
00:43:54,380 --> 00:43:59,720
Is that okay because it's for the students applying for medical school?

599
00:43:59,720 --> 00:44:02,440
You teach Korean.

600
00:44:02,440 --> 00:44:07,470
Reading the entire text from the textbook and discussing it...

601
00:44:07,470 --> 00:44:12,190
We're wondering if that's going too far.

602
00:44:12,190 --> 00:44:15,460
There are other good options. Essay writing or

603
00:44:15,460 --> 00:44:18,160
EBS-related lectures.

604
00:44:18,160 --> 00:44:19,820
Teachers...

605
00:44:20,620 --> 00:44:24,980
have the right to teach independently and freely.

606
00:44:24,980 --> 00:44:29,160
This is academic freedom that no one can interfere with.

607
00:44:29,160 --> 00:44:34,040
Don't think we're taking your academic freedom away.

608
00:44:34,040 --> 00:44:36,670
I'm just saying...

609
00:44:38,390 --> 00:44:42,750
you should try focusing on the exam more.

610
00:44:50,350 --> 00:44:52,610
Mr. Pyo. Mr. Pyo.

611
00:44:52,610 --> 00:44:54,440
I'll get going.

612
00:44:55,390 --> 00:44:58,840
Gosh, seriously. Mr. Pyo! Mr. Pyo!

613
00:44:58,840 --> 00:45:01,870
She's the icon of the academy and an ad model.

614
00:45:01,870 --> 00:45:07,560
My conclusion is that we have no hope as long as Ms. Seo is around.

615
00:45:07,560 --> 00:45:11,550
It's impossible to beat her. Especially the English department has no hope.

616
00:45:11,550 --> 00:45:15,340
Don't say stuff like that. Especially in front of the new teachers.

617
00:45:15,340 --> 00:45:17,200
It's okay.

618
00:45:18,010 --> 00:45:22,060
Your feelings still get hurt once in a while.

619
00:45:22,060 --> 00:45:24,810
Excuse me. Excuse me.

620
00:45:28,980 --> 00:45:33,110
Han Ju, it's been a while. You're done with the class, right?

621
00:45:34,080 --> 00:45:38,540
Yes. I'm a successful teacher in Daechi-dong.

622
00:45:38,540 --> 00:45:43,600
It's still hard to process it. Yes.

623
00:45:44,760 --> 00:45:48,210
By the way, I wanted to ask you something.

624
00:45:48,210 --> 00:45:54,320
Did Mr. Pyo Sang Seob of Guksa Polytechnic High switch schools?

625
00:45:54,320 --> 00:45:58,810
He had a year left there as I remember.

626
00:46:00,700 --> 00:46:02,230
Yes.

627
00:46:07,610 --> 00:46:08,900
Oh, really?

628
00:46:08,900 --> 00:46:12,960
But our academy doesn't do anything criminal, at least.

629
00:46:12,960 --> 00:46:15,580
They'd better not.

630
00:46:16,600 --> 00:46:21,150
Excuse me. I'm sorry, do you mind if I leave now?

631
00:46:21,150 --> 00:46:25,930
Come on, Ms. Nam. I thought you wanted to party hard tonight.

632
00:46:25,930 --> 00:46:30,830
Sorry, sorry. I need to do something urgently. I'm sorry. See you tomorrow.

633
00:46:30,830 --> 00:46:32,290
- See you.
 - Bye.

634
00:46:32,290 --> 00:46:36,640
 Daechi Chase 

635
00:46:36,640 --> 00:46:40,420
 Lectures to improve school grades 

636
00:46:46,770 --> 00:46:49,260
Free lecture?

637
00:46:49,260 --> 00:46:51,900
No way.

638
00:46:51,900 --> 00:46:56,280
You show half of a three-hour lecture as a preview.

639
00:46:56,280 --> 00:47:00,200
Teachers who are entering a new field use that tactic sometimes.

640
00:47:00,200 --> 00:47:03,880
Why haven't you used it if it's effective?

641
00:47:05,290 --> 00:47:08,520
Have you been to a ramen tasting in grocery stores?

642
00:47:08,520 --> 00:47:09,710
Of course.

643
00:47:09,710 --> 00:47:13,500
Have you seen them giving you the most popular ramen?

644
00:47:14,300 --> 00:47:15,490
No, because I already know what it tastes like.

645
00:47:15,490 --> 00:47:21,390
Yes. Director Choi and I are the familiar ones with a long history.

646
00:47:21,390 --> 00:47:25,810
You're a new product no one has ever tasted.

647
00:47:33,170 --> 00:47:35,350
What?

648
00:47:35,350 --> 00:47:37,190
Whoa!

649
00:47:38,580 --> 00:47:43,350
My mother looked into other academies a lot when my grades weren't improving.

650
00:47:43,350 --> 00:47:45,480
I know. There were rumors about you.

651
00:47:45,480 --> 00:47:48,320
But I insisted that I stay here.

652
00:47:48,320 --> 00:47:49,950
Why did you?

653
00:47:49,950 --> 00:47:54,520
Because you never gave up on making me understand and convinced me.

654
00:47:54,520 --> 00:47:56,520
So?

655
00:47:56,520 --> 00:47:58,760
Are you ready to study now?

656
00:47:58,760 --> 00:48:00,010
Yes.

657
00:48:00,010 --> 00:48:04,460
I'll share the blackboard notes and lecture planning for Huiwon High first.

658
00:48:04,460 --> 00:48:06,900
Choose the part you'd be best at.

659
00:48:06,900 --> 00:48:10,110
- I don't care what I end up with.
 - Okay.

660
00:48:10,110 --> 00:48:13,390
But how come other people can't see this?

661
00:48:13,390 --> 00:48:14,950
Well...

662
00:48:15,800 --> 00:48:19,020
It's still a secret that we're preparing joint lectures.

663
00:48:19,020 --> 00:48:20,430
Of course.

664
00:48:20,430 --> 00:48:23,390
What if Ms. Nam Cheong Mi or Kim Chae Yun

665
00:48:23,390 --> 00:48:26,080
saw us doing this right now?

666
00:48:26,080 --> 00:48:28,640
How do you think they'd feel?

667
00:48:29,290 --> 00:48:30,920
The rumor would spread and—

668
00:48:30,920 --> 00:48:36,220
You'll be the privileged one. The one that's inheriting Seo Hye Jin's lecturing tips.

669
00:48:36,220 --> 00:48:40,330
Ms. Kim has been working with me for five years, but we've never done this.

670
00:48:40,330 --> 00:48:45,660
Lecturing skills.  It's a major trade secret among lecturers.

671
00:48:45,660 --> 00:48:47,320
Trade secret.

672
00:48:47,950 --> 00:48:52,510
Teachers even disappear with the attendance book when they quit.

673
00:48:52,510 --> 00:48:54,670
Oh.

674
00:48:54,670 --> 00:48:57,740
It is a privilege. And it'd be twice as hard for you.

675
00:48:57,740 --> 00:49:00,480
That's what I'm saying. Focus so I don't have to repeat myself.

676
00:49:00,480 --> 00:49:02,190
Got it.

 You haven't seen the best* of Korean lectures! 
 (Choeseon means "best") 

679
00:49:21,520 --> 00:49:24,050
This could work.

 The mail was sent successfully. 

684
00:49:50,970 --> 00:49:54,490
 TN:* "Hunminjeongeum", The Correct Sounds for the Instruction of the People, also, an old name for Hangul, the Korean alphabet. 

685
00:49:54,490 --> 00:49:59,500
To understand King Sejong's Hunminjeongeum* properly, you need to understand the basics of medieval Korean first.

686
00:49:59,500 --> 00:50:05,170
You need to know the principles of the production of consonants and vowels first.

687
00:50:05,170 --> 00:50:07,370
Let's start with consonants first.

688
00:50:07,370 --> 00:50:09,670
The number of Hunminjeongeum's initial consonants is—

689
00:50:09,670 --> 00:50:11,540
Seventeen.

690
00:50:12,440 --> 00:50:15,120
You graduated a long time ago, but you remember it.

691
00:50:15,120 --> 00:50:17,770
I'm playing a student who studied in advance.

692
00:50:17,770 --> 00:50:19,920
The initial consonants are—

693
00:50:19,920 --> 00:50:22,430
written how they sound.

694
00:50:23,860 --> 00:50:24,910
What are the production principles?

695
00:50:24,910 --> 00:50:28,310
Hieroglyphics, addition of lines, and independent consonants.

696
00:50:28,310 --> 00:50:31,650
Should I stop? Should I quit?

697
00:50:31,650 --> 00:50:33,290
Quit.

698
00:50:35,850 --> 00:50:37,110
 The passcode is incorrect. 

699
00:50:37,110 --> 00:50:38,510
What's that?

700
00:50:38,510 --> 00:50:40,820
Damn.  What is it?

701
00:50:48,320 --> 00:50:50,690
 Confirmed. 

702
00:51:04,970 --> 00:51:06,710
What?

703
00:51:06,710 --> 00:51:08,360
Damn.

704
00:51:09,350 --> 00:51:13,080
My purse is in the office. My purse is in the office.

705
00:51:13,080 --> 00:51:15,060
Be quiet.

706
00:51:27,960 --> 00:51:29,960
Is someone in there?

707
00:52:02,830 --> 00:52:04,970
Yes, Chae Yun.

708
00:52:06,260 --> 00:52:10,570
Gosh, I'm so sorry.

709
00:52:11,370 --> 00:52:15,160
I'm back at the academy. I remembered to check something.

710
00:52:15,860 --> 00:52:17,990
 I'm not ambitious at all. 

711
00:52:17,990 --> 00:52:22,440
 Okay. I'll treat you properly next time. 

712
00:52:23,090 --> 00:52:27,500
Okay. See you. Bye.

713
00:52:42,400 --> 00:52:44,430
Don't laugh.

I don't think she's going to go.

717
00:53:56,570 --> 00:53:58,170
Let's see.

718
00:54:02,100 --> 00:54:03,340
What will we do?

719
00:54:03,340 --> 00:54:05,600
Wait. Wait.

720
00:55:30,420 --> 00:55:33,210
Why would they leave the lights on?

721
00:55:52,920 --> 00:55:54,850
Gosh, my legs.

722
00:57:01,360 --> 00:57:04,030
Let's use the interior stairs. Inside.

723
00:57:37,740 --> 00:57:39,350
Ms. Seo.

724
00:57:42,560 --> 00:57:44,180
Ms. Seo.

725
00:57:44,770 --> 00:57:48,130
- Yes, what?
 - Why are your hands so cold?

726
00:57:48,130 --> 00:57:50,850
They always are. They always are.

727
00:57:50,850 --> 00:57:52,630
You got scared.

728
00:57:53,330 --> 00:57:57,370
How will you achieve something great with that timid spirit?

729
00:57:57,370 --> 00:57:59,470
It's not like we got caught holding hands.

730
00:57:59,470 --> 00:58:01,810
Let's get going first.

731
00:58:01,810 --> 00:58:03,890
You need to take the passenger seat this time.

732
00:58:04,530 --> 00:58:07,940
I think I'll die if I let you drive again.

733
00:58:07,940 --> 00:58:09,660
I'll drive.

734
00:58:10,550 --> 00:58:12,390
Get in. Get in.

735
00:58:26,070 --> 00:58:29,410
I wonder what's going on with Ms. Nam.

736
00:58:29,410 --> 00:58:32,900
I know. Everyone should be eating and drinking now.

737
00:58:33,490 --> 00:58:35,950
You must be hungry, by the way.

738
00:58:35,950 --> 00:58:39,190
I'm okay. I can snack on something at home.

739
00:58:39,960 --> 00:58:42,930
Will my face get puffy for the photoshoot tomorrow?

740
00:58:42,930 --> 00:58:46,360
That won't be good. The image is very important, too.

741
00:58:46,360 --> 00:58:50,240
I'm crazy good-looking, even if I get puffy.

742
00:58:57,930 --> 00:59:00,670
Ms. Nam, over here.

743
00:59:02,210 --> 00:59:04,630
Gosh, I'm sorry. It must be your bedtime.

744
00:59:04,630 --> 00:59:10,140
Not at all. I was up waiting for my son.

745
00:59:11,020 --> 00:59:15,130
- By the way, what's going on?
 - Well...

746
00:59:16,230 --> 00:59:17,980
- Manager Kim.
 - Yes.

747
00:59:17,980 --> 00:59:20,180
You know the school I'd be teaching...

748
00:59:20,180 --> 00:59:24,590
Would it be bad for Ms. Seo if I taught Chanyeong High?

749
00:59:24,590 --> 00:59:25,960
Chanyeong High?

750
00:59:25,960 --> 00:59:29,340
Yes. I think I can do well.

751
00:59:32,260 --> 00:59:36,580
That'd be terrible for her, of course.

752
00:59:36,580 --> 00:59:41,450
And it won't be so good for you, either.

753
00:59:41,450 --> 00:59:46,500
I looked through some documents. I think I have an edge.

754
00:59:46,500 --> 00:59:49,660
Looks like they often assign several teachers

755
00:59:49,660 --> 00:59:52,890
to one school to make them compete.

756
00:59:52,890 --> 00:59:55,060
But we don't recommend it.

757
00:59:57,810 --> 01:00:03,600
I created a list of schools we haven't gotten to teach.

758
01:00:06,630 --> 01:00:10,050
But I really want to.

759
01:00:10,050 --> 01:00:12,470
I'll take good care of you.

760
01:00:12,470 --> 01:00:14,310
Mom?

761
01:00:14,310 --> 01:00:16,870
Hey, you're back.

762
01:00:16,870 --> 01:00:18,390
What are you doing here?

763
01:00:18,390 --> 01:00:21,260
Well, this is a teacher from the academy.

764
01:00:21,260 --> 01:00:24,130
She wanted to ask me something.

765
01:00:24,130 --> 01:00:25,820
So late?

766
01:00:26,790 --> 01:00:28,190
Go inside, Manager Kim.

767
01:00:28,190 --> 01:00:30,040
Okay, Ms. Nam.

768
01:00:30,040 --> 01:00:31,590
See you tomorrow.

769
01:00:31,590 --> 01:00:33,440
Okay.

770
01:00:33,440 --> 01:00:35,070
Let's go in.

771
01:00:35,070 --> 01:00:38,550
How come you're so late every day?

772
01:00:38,550 --> 01:00:41,350
Why? Did you miss me?

773
01:00:41,350 --> 01:00:42,870
Yes.

774
01:00:53,760 --> 01:00:56,780
Gosh, what a shame.

775
01:01:45,780 --> 01:01:48,090
Yes, Mr. Lee.

776
01:01:49,900 --> 01:01:52,360
What do you think? Do we look okay?

777
01:01:52,360 --> 01:01:54,570
Gosh, it's really amazing. 
  Teacher Pupil Tag Team 

778
01:01:54,570 --> 01:01:57,070

779
01:01:58,100 --> 01:01:59,760

Huh?

785
01:02:22,260 --> 01:02:26,750
It would've been nice if you'd warned us in advance.

786
01:02:26,750 --> 01:02:30,550
Ms. Seo really wanted to keep it a secret.

787
01:02:30,550 --> 01:02:34,160
You know it's hard for us to say no to her.

788
01:02:34,160 --> 01:02:37,630
You should keep other teachers' morale up, too.

789
01:02:37,630 --> 01:02:42,870
I know you take good care of them already.

790
01:02:46,330 --> 01:02:48,480
There will be a huge backlash.

791
01:02:49,280 --> 01:02:51,080
Backlash?

792
01:02:51,080 --> 01:02:55,850
They'll understand why, but it's an emotional matter.

793
01:03:00,280 --> 01:03:01,850
Geez.

794
01:03:03,330 --> 01:03:05,780
Are they even qualified?

795
01:03:07,430 --> 01:03:10,830
Tell me to bring an idea as explosive

796
01:03:10,830 --> 01:03:13,230
and noticeable as Seo Hye Jin and Lee Jun Ho.

797
01:03:13,230 --> 01:03:16,520
I'll be happy to open up my wallet.

798
01:03:16,520 --> 01:03:18,850
If they won't do that,

799
01:03:18,850 --> 01:03:23,810
tell them to think carefully about what will be good for them.

800
01:03:24,810 --> 01:03:27,380
"Just enjoy the party and eat the rice cakes."

801
01:03:28,070 --> 01:03:31,650
I can't tell them that.

802
01:03:31,650 --> 01:03:35,270
Why are you speaking so harshly?

803
01:03:35,270 --> 01:03:37,980
I'm saying we should act professionally.

804
01:03:38,830 --> 01:03:42,500
We know lecturers compete individually,

805
01:03:42,500 --> 01:03:45,130
but we can't help but feel disappointed.

806
01:03:46,440 --> 01:03:48,740
It would've been better if you'd warned us.

807
01:03:50,870 --> 01:03:52,420
I'm sorry.

808
01:03:52,420 --> 01:03:55,640
I wanted to proceed with caution.

809
01:03:55,640 --> 01:03:59,460
Do you not care about what's fair at all?

810
01:04:01,260 --> 01:04:04,920
Just think of us as scouts.

811
01:04:04,920 --> 01:04:09,840
You've gotten more students because your class came right before or after mine.

812
01:04:09,840 --> 01:04:12,500
Huiwon High is a good opportunity for you, too.

813
01:04:12,500 --> 01:04:14,710
If we schedule classes back to back,

814
01:04:14,710 --> 01:04:17,920
your chance of opening a Huiwon class will go up, too.

815
01:04:17,920 --> 01:04:19,130
Yes, and?

816
01:04:19,130 --> 01:04:21,950
I assure you it won't hurt your career.

817
01:04:21,950 --> 01:04:23,260
Do you promise?

818
01:04:23,260 --> 01:04:25,310
I'll promote your classes every time.

819
01:04:25,310 --> 01:04:29,110
I'll hand out your ad whenever I give them class materials.

820
01:04:29,110 --> 01:04:31,290
So don't take it so personally.

821
01:04:31,290 --> 01:04:35,440
How about me? I teach Korean like you.

822
01:04:35,440 --> 01:04:40,490
Please be in charge of Daesan International High if I get to teach Huiwon.

823
01:04:41,130 --> 01:04:42,960
Please help us out.

824
01:04:49,860 --> 01:04:52,950
You'd better start a Huiwon High class.

825
01:04:52,950 --> 01:04:56,590
I need to get your crumbs to feel better.

826
01:04:56,590 --> 01:04:58,350
I will.

827
01:05:08,290 --> 01:05:10,520
Did you two prepare a lot?

828
01:05:10,520 --> 01:05:12,390
We did enough.

829
01:05:15,280 --> 01:05:18,570
You know a lot of people are watching you, right?

830
01:05:20,500 --> 01:05:24,530
Be fair and assess the situation carefully.

831
01:05:24,530 --> 01:05:26,810
I'd like you to do that, personally.

832
01:05:26,810 --> 01:05:28,630
I'm doing that.

833
01:05:29,460 --> 01:05:31,840
The crown has its weight.

834
01:05:31,840 --> 01:05:34,410
You need to love your fans equally.

835
01:05:38,250 --> 01:05:39,970
Shall we get coffee?

836
01:06:00,620 --> 01:06:03,950
- Here you go.
 - Thank you.

837
01:06:06,040 --> 01:06:09,790
I don't feel so disappointed somehow.

838
01:06:10,470 --> 01:06:11,940
Why not?

839
01:06:13,850 --> 01:06:18,490
I don't want to sound too calculating by saying this.

840
01:06:21,470 --> 01:06:26,290
If it succeeds, Team Leader Kim will have a lot to share with us.

841
01:06:28,280 --> 01:06:29,360
What if it fails?

842
01:06:29,360 --> 01:06:31,200
That's the point.

843
01:06:31,200 --> 01:06:34,240
If you were to fail, it would be best if it happened quietly.

844
01:06:34,240 --> 01:06:38,030
She'd get hurt a lot if she failed after making such a fuss.

845
01:06:38,030 --> 01:06:41,200
To put it simply, whether she fails or not,

846
01:06:41,200 --> 01:06:43,460
we won't suffer any loss.

847
01:06:43,460 --> 01:06:47,420
That's why the other team leaders complained a little and backed down.

848
01:06:48,130 --> 01:06:51,930
Also, Gray Witch declared war first.

849
01:06:51,930 --> 01:06:54,040
It won't be easy.

850
01:06:58,210 --> 01:07:03,010
The water content needs to be lower.

851
01:07:09,090 --> 01:07:10,650
Try this.

852
01:07:11,280 --> 01:07:13,980
Let me try some, too.

853
01:07:13,980 --> 01:07:15,480
What is it?

854
01:07:16,930 --> 01:07:20,540
Is it chicken? It was pork before.

855
01:07:22,570 --> 01:07:25,830
It's just a flyer for a free lecture.

856
01:07:25,830 --> 01:07:29,130
Although the copy is a bit provocative.

857
01:07:30,030 --> 01:07:32,460
Who's this kid named Lee Jun Ho?

858
01:07:33,360 --> 01:07:36,610
He was Seo Hye Jin's student for three years in high school.

859
01:07:36,610 --> 01:07:39,610
He was in Grade 8 for the first mock exam,

860
01:07:39,610 --> 01:07:43,790
but he was taught by a college student and got into Korea University.

861
01:07:44,590 --> 01:07:47,420
I think I might remember it.

862
01:07:48,030 --> 01:07:51,340
Lee Jun Ho's mother was a famous soccer mom,

863
01:07:51,340 --> 01:07:55,320
and Seo Hye Jin ended up getting a lot of Chanyeong students from it.

864
01:07:55,320 --> 01:07:57,620
They both owe each other.

865
01:07:58,350 --> 01:08:03,290
I don't think you need to worry so much.

866
01:08:04,100 --> 01:08:06,370
Mr. Park Gi Seong,

867
01:08:07,340 --> 01:08:10,720
how long have you been working for me?

868
01:08:10,720 --> 01:08:13,180
It's been eight years now.

869
01:08:13,180 --> 01:08:14,770
But...

870
01:08:16,030 --> 01:08:19,480
you think this is just an ordinary free lecture event?

871
01:08:22,250 --> 01:08:26,020
They made me change my Huiwon class schedule by making one silly call.

872
01:08:26,020 --> 01:08:28,910
And they scheduled this event on the day

873
01:08:28,910 --> 01:08:33,140
I teach a class. Three hours before it, even.

874
01:08:35,290 --> 01:08:41,500
Do you find this shrewd behavior ordinary, Mr. Park?

875
01:08:41,500 --> 01:08:43,620
What I meant is...

876
01:08:43,620 --> 01:08:46,660
that their challenge is already doomed.

877
01:08:46,660 --> 01:08:50,420
Do you know the problem with kids with poor grades?

878
01:08:53,890 --> 01:08:57,420
They don't even know what they don't know.

879
01:08:59,070 --> 01:09:03,890
You need to beat students like that to teach them

880
01:09:03,890 --> 01:09:06,280
if you're a teacher.

881
01:09:06,280 --> 01:09:10,260
We're fortunate that we're facing the finals.

882
01:09:10,260 --> 01:09:11,290
Why?

883
01:09:11,290 --> 01:09:14,800
Huiwon High prioritizes grammar in midterms.

884
01:09:16,580 --> 01:09:18,510
It's hard to set yourself apart.

885
01:09:18,510 --> 01:09:21,290
- I'll go to a class now.
 - Okay.

886
01:09:27,970 --> 01:09:29,790
This is Seo Hye Jin.

887
01:09:29,790 --> 01:09:32,290
I'm Choi Hyeong Seon of Choeseon Korean.

888
01:09:32,290 --> 01:09:37,760
I ended up introducing myself over the phone first.

889
01:09:37,760 --> 01:09:41,330
I owe you an apology for the rude ad.

890
01:09:41,330 --> 01:09:43,390
Not at all.

891
01:09:45,280 --> 01:09:49,820
I called to ask you a favor.

892
01:09:49,820 --> 01:09:56,280
I just want you to do your best for the free lecture.

893
01:09:58,660 --> 01:10:03,030
There are a lot of small lectures for Huiwon High,

894
01:10:03,030 --> 01:10:07,890
but I haven't seen one that sets itself apart.

895
01:10:07,890 --> 01:10:12,150
I'm hoping we feel motivated by it.

896
01:10:12,150 --> 01:10:14,770
That's why I called you.

897
01:10:16,060 --> 01:10:22,350
Yes, I'm looking forward to your Chanyeong High class, too.

898
01:10:22,350 --> 01:10:25,920
If the class ever happens.

899
01:10:34,670 --> 01:10:43,940


900
01:10:58,630 --> 01:11:00,070
♫ Steady as she goes  ♫

901
01:11:00,070 --> 01:11:03,810
 The Midnight Romance in Hagwon 

902
01:11:03,810 --> 01:11:05,320
 I want to start a Chanyeong High class, too. 

903
01:11:05,320 --> 01:11:07,210
 - Ms. Nam.
 - There's such a thing as business ethics. 

904
01:11:07,210 --> 01:11:09,540
 You'd get shot if you told Ms. Nam that. 

905
01:11:09,540 --> 01:11:12,050
 - Ms. Seo.
 - You'd rather be doing what? 

906
01:11:12,050 --> 01:11:13,650
 Do we just need to predict the exam questions better? 

907
01:11:13,650 --> 01:11:15,360
 What else do you need from me? 

908
01:11:15,360 --> 01:11:18,110
 Stop arguing and do as I say. I'm right. 

909
01:11:18,110 --> 01:11:20,130
 Seo Hye Jin's lecture will get canceled. 

910
01:11:20,130 --> 01:11:23,200
 Poor thing. I'm sure she prepared a lot. 

911
01:11:23,200 --> 01:11:25,220
 The attendance rate is 99%. 

912
01:11:25,220 --> 01:11:27,520
 - The unforgettable memory of victory.
 - Let's make one. 

913
01:11:27,520 --> 01:11:28,920
 Are you sure you guided them properly? 

914
01:11:28,920 --> 01:11:31,550
 I think the Teacher-Pupil Tag Team failed. 

915
01:11:31,550 --> 01:11:35,600
 You need to prove that you weren't chosen due to privilege.
