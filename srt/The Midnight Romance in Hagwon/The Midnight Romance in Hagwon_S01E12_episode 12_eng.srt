15
00:00:57,030 --> 00:01:00,320
It takes me less than a minute to get here.

16
00:01:01,870 --> 00:01:05,530
In that short time coming here after seeing both of you,

17
00:01:06,940 --> 00:01:09,120
- I had all sorts of thoughts.
 - Mr. Lee.

18
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:11,990
Who suggested meeting first?

19
00:01:11,990 --> 00:01:14,430
Why do you have to see each other more?

20
00:01:14,430 --> 00:01:16,650
What's Director Choi doing this time?

21
00:01:16,650 --> 00:01:18,780
I suggested that we meet.

22
00:01:18,780 --> 00:01:21,520
What else did you need to talk about?

23
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:26,200
Why do I have to tell you that, Mr. Lee?

24
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:29,210
Please wait at the academy, Mr. Lee.

25
00:01:33,460 --> 00:01:35,460
I think I should leave first.

26
00:01:35,460 --> 00:01:39,970
Can you just finish the rest of what you wanted to say?

27
00:01:41,250 --> 00:01:43,780
I don't want the two of you to meet again.

28
00:01:43,780 --> 00:01:46,270
Leave now, okay?

29
00:01:53,500 --> 00:01:55,830
You two...

30
00:01:55,830 --> 00:01:58,540
You've been a student and teacher for a long time.

31
00:01:58,540 --> 00:02:01,260
I know you've taught a class together.

32
00:02:01,260 --> 00:02:06,750
But what you're saying sounds strange. As if—

33
00:02:06,750 --> 00:02:09,690
I think you're being more strange.

34
00:02:10,750 --> 00:02:13,820
You keep giving me the wrong impression.

35
00:02:13,820 --> 00:02:16,800
Aren't you confident you could beat her?

36
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:20,080
Is that why you're trying to provoke her instead?

37
00:02:24,230 --> 00:02:28,530
Someone apparently took all of my class files.

38
00:02:32,090 --> 00:02:34,530
- What do you mean?
 - Don't be rude.

39
00:02:34,530 --> 00:02:38,490
Mr. Pyo is here to tell me that now.

40
00:02:40,170 --> 00:02:45,370
Seo Hye Jin! I'm here.

41
00:02:52,300 --> 00:02:56,460
Assistant Director Wu apparently has a USB of my files.

42
00:02:56,460 --> 00:02:59,340
It's all of my files, but no one's actually seen it.

43
00:02:59,340 --> 00:03:02,000
What's with them at that table?

44
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,720
- Is he an academy teacher?
 - I don't know, either.

45
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:07,840
I wanted to eavesdrop because I didn't think Mr. Lee would be here.

46
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:11,150
Let's do it later. I misjudged the situation.

47
00:03:11,150 --> 00:03:13,120
Have a seat.

48
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:16,390
No one has seen the files. How can we believe that?

49
00:03:16,390 --> 00:03:21,130
She might be trying to confuse and attack you psychologically.

50
00:03:21,130 --> 00:03:23,130
It's not like that.

51
00:03:23,130 --> 00:03:26,080
It's coming from the Assistant Director Wu.

52
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:33,250
What will you do now?

53
00:03:34,410 --> 00:03:36,530
I'm not sure.

54
00:03:36,530 --> 00:03:39,740
This is the first time it's happened.

55
00:03:39,740 --> 00:03:45,350
First of all, Director Choi can't find out that you told me.

56
00:03:45,350 --> 00:03:48,390
You don't have to worry about me.

57
00:03:48,390 --> 00:03:51,120
Not showing up to my appointment with her

58
00:03:52,530 --> 00:03:54,780
probably left a mark on me.

59
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:15,600
Mr. Pyo didn't show up.

60
00:04:16,340 --> 00:04:18,990
No, I'm not offended at all.

61
00:04:20,330 --> 00:04:24,220
Do we have another reason to meet?

62
00:04:29,930 --> 00:04:33,920
The worst thing I can do now is to sue her.

63
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:38,400
"Wu Seung Hui stole Seo Hye Jin's files."

64
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:40,410
To hear that one sentence in court,

65
00:04:40,410 --> 00:04:44,400
I have to put my career and everything I have at stake and fight.

66
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:50,100
I'd be entering the endless battle myself using my own money.

67
00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:54,100
What would be the point even if I won the case?

68
00:04:54,100 --> 00:04:57,850
I'd be completely forgotten in this town by then.

69
00:04:59,450 --> 00:05:02,510
Isn't that what Assistant Director Wu wants the most?

70
00:05:06,830 --> 00:05:09,420
What will you do, then?

71
00:05:09,420 --> 00:05:11,790
I'm still thinking about it.

72
00:05:22,350 --> 00:05:26,150
Can you just not think about it?

73
00:05:27,370 --> 00:05:29,560
No matter who she gives it to

74
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:32,560
and however they end up using it, just forget about it.

75
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:35,220
- What do you mean—
 - This is for the better.

76
00:05:35,220 --> 00:05:38,840
We can create something great from scratch together.

77
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:42,440
Are you saying my work hasn't been great?

78
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:44,600
Don't play ignorant.

79
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:47,750
I'm saying you can make something much better.

80
00:05:47,750 --> 00:05:50,690
Not stuff like exam-taking skills and question prediction.

81
00:05:50,690 --> 00:05:52,400
Let the kids read on their own.

82
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:53,990
I thought we finished that conversation earlier.

83
00:05:53,990 --> 00:05:57,840
No. We're just getting started now.

84
00:06:00,070 --> 00:06:02,030
Are you avoiding it again?

85
00:06:05,940 --> 00:06:08,390
Mr. Pyo, please excuse us for a moment.

86
00:06:08,390 --> 00:06:10,010
Sure.

87
00:06:16,990 --> 00:06:22,770
Okay. I'll explain gradually and slowly.

88
00:06:22,770 --> 00:06:26,590
I won't repeat myself. Focus.

89
00:06:26,590 --> 00:06:28,740
First of all, I'm not saying you're wrong.

90
00:06:28,740 --> 00:06:31,160
Of course, I've thought that, too.

91
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:33,280
Telling them which part will be in the exam

92
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:36,020
and teaching them exam-taking skills made me sad, too.

93
00:06:36,020 --> 00:06:39,130
"This is such a great text. This is such a great work of literature.

94
00:06:39,130 --> 00:06:41,980
But they'll forget it the moment the exam ends."

95
00:06:41,980 --> 00:06:44,960
Thinking that got me upset, too.

96
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:48,560
But look. We need to send them to college.

97
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:52,440
You also came here to make money in a short amount of time.

98
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:53,950
But what did you say just now?

99
00:06:53,950 --> 00:06:56,510
I said I'll teach them how to read.

100
00:06:56,510 --> 00:06:58,350
Unless we follow them to the exam room—

101
00:06:58,350 --> 00:07:01,390
We don't have to repeat what we said earlier.

102
00:07:01,390 --> 00:07:04,280
One. That method hasn't been proven.

103
00:07:04,280 --> 00:07:06,540
That means you'd use the students as test subjects.

104
00:07:06,540 --> 00:07:10,380
Two. Even if it worked, the results would show very slowly.

105
00:07:10,380 --> 00:07:13,420
You said we don't have to repeat ourselves.

106
00:07:14,790 --> 00:07:17,920
Last, even if we overcome all that,

107
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:21,380
you can't apply that to the school exams.

108
00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:28,050
Each teacher teaches content differently.

109
00:07:31,970 --> 00:07:34,760
Team Leader Seo.

110
00:07:34,760 --> 00:07:40,720
One. I'm offended that you accuse me of using the students as test subjects.

111
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:43,000
Don't you feel sorry for them?

112
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:47,590
They're worried the questions the teachers picked out won't be on the exam.

113
00:07:47,590 --> 00:07:50,250
Don't you feel sorry for them?

114
00:07:50,250 --> 00:07:52,630
- Are exams a game of chance?
 - I know.

115
00:07:52,630 --> 00:07:54,440
- I'm not finished.
 - Don't interrupt me, then.

116
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:58,290
I'm your colleague, not the eighth grader right now.

117
00:08:00,050 --> 00:08:02,140
Okay, two.

118
00:08:02,140 --> 00:08:04,540
You're insulting the students when you say it'd take too long.

119
00:08:04,540 --> 00:08:06,200
Kids that age are very fast learners.

120
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:09,840
- Enough. This would never end. Let's stop.
 - Three.

121
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:12,490
Are the school exams and entrance exams different?

122
00:08:13,510 --> 00:08:18,000
- The principles are the same.
 - Understand your job and position.

123
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:21,600
You're the one who needs to understand.

124
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:25,090
You're not a government worker who has a secure job forever.

125
00:08:26,130 --> 00:08:29,570
Think of your future objectively.

126
00:08:29,570 --> 00:08:33,570
Do you really believe that you resemble Director Choi?

127
00:08:33,570 --> 00:08:38,100
Do you think you could do this for twenty years, just like the Gray Witch?

128
00:08:39,710 --> 00:08:41,690
I think you should watch what you say.

129
00:08:41,690 --> 00:08:43,670
How dare you compare me to her?

130
00:08:43,670 --> 00:08:45,930
That's not the point I'm making.

131
00:08:45,930 --> 00:08:48,350
I'm telling you to think of your future.

132
00:08:48,350 --> 00:08:50,930
Who do you think makes me angry the most?

133
00:08:50,930 --> 00:08:52,720
Assistant Director Wu, who stole my files?

134
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:54,480
Or Director Choi, who's trying to use that?

135
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:57,750
No, it's you, Mr. Lee.

136
00:08:58,750 --> 00:09:01,350
They at least value the work I've done.

137
00:09:01,350 --> 00:09:03,470
But what are you saying?

138
00:09:03,470 --> 00:09:06,900
Is it okay to find my life's work so useless?

139
00:09:06,900 --> 00:09:10,320
They value your past ten years.

140
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:13,190
- I'm talking about your future from now on. 
 - Gosh, let's stop.

141
00:09:13,190 --> 00:09:16,960
I've worked hard enough, so I don't need to rely on others.

142
00:09:18,180 --> 00:09:20,130
Am I "others" to you?

143
00:09:20,130 --> 00:09:22,490
You aren't just undervaluing my files.

144
00:09:22,490 --> 00:09:25,810
You're undervaluing my efforts, knowledge, and achievements right now.

145
00:09:25,810 --> 00:09:28,540
I wouldn't be asking for your permission if I did.

146
00:09:28,540 --> 00:09:30,550
I can just do whatever I want to do.

147
00:09:30,550 --> 00:09:33,680
It'd be my responsibility whether I succeed or fail.

148
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:37,300
- Of course, I won't fail.
 - You think I will, then?

149
00:09:37,300 --> 00:09:41,020
- I take that back. That was childish.
 - No.

150
00:09:41,020 --> 00:09:43,820
I think you might fail.

151
00:09:43,820 --> 00:09:46,440
Unless I stop you from being stubborn now.

152
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:48,120
I told you to watch what you say.

153
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:50,940
What have you been building all this time?

154
00:09:50,940 --> 00:09:53,610
Isn't it a sand castle that would collapse if someone stole your files?

155
00:09:53,610 --> 00:09:56,730
- Are you crazy?
 - No, I'm totally sane.

156
00:09:56,730 --> 00:09:59,330
It's a pity that no one's as sane as me in this town.

157
00:09:59,330 --> 00:10:03,050
What would you get from provoking and insulting me like this?

158
00:10:04,280 --> 00:10:05,990
Our eternal love?

159
00:10:17,090 --> 00:10:19,860
This is my first time wearing this after dry cleaning it.

160
00:10:19,860 --> 00:10:21,670
Gosh.

161
00:10:21,670 --> 00:10:25,600
You think the top of the class or school would be enough?

162
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:28,000
Don't you want to make someone the top of the country?

163
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:31,480
I'm suggesting we live well for eternity with that.

164
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:35,170
I'm sorry.  For now, today, we should

165
00:10:35,170 --> 00:10:38,440
You want to make a student the top in the country?

166
00:10:39,340 --> 00:10:40,730
Yes.

167
00:10:42,190 --> 00:10:46,880
I thought your academy was known for improving school grades.

168
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:51,740
I heard Ms. Seo analyzes my breathing pattern, too.

169
00:10:51,740 --> 00:10:54,850
I want to help students prevail for any question.

170
00:10:54,850 --> 00:10:56,430
Leave now.

171
00:10:58,210 --> 00:11:03,390
I'd like to talk more if you're free.

172
00:11:03,390 --> 00:11:05,350
With Mr. Lee.

173
00:11:05,350 --> 00:11:07,600
 The first period determines your grade 

174
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:09,250
 Reading is a must 

175
00:11:09,250 --> 00:11:14,160
Gosh, this bastard. I told him not to do this.

176
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:16,660
Have you two talked about something?

177
00:11:16,660 --> 00:11:19,360
Yes, I gave him a piece of advice.

178
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:24,630
I told him to focus on memorizing skills to build a skyscraper in Gangnam.

179
00:11:24,630 --> 00:11:28,630
So you mean this is no good?

180
00:11:28,630 --> 00:11:30,570
Not exactly.

181
00:11:31,780 --> 00:11:33,300
What?

182
00:11:33,300 --> 00:11:36,050
Ms. Seo's early method.

183
00:11:36,050 --> 00:11:39,290
This is how I learned, too.

184
00:11:39,290 --> 00:11:42,090
That means it's no good anymore.

185
00:11:42,090 --> 00:11:45,130
Why do you keep saying, "no good"?

186
00:11:46,620 --> 00:11:51,950
Ms. Seo became the gatekeeper of Chanyeong High after evolving for 10 years.

187
00:11:51,950 --> 00:11:54,650
But Joon Ho is going for a different strategy.

188
00:11:54,650 --> 00:11:58,590
Instead, there's no guarantee this would succeed.

189
00:12:00,110 --> 00:12:03,620
Explain simply. You're confusing me.

190
00:12:08,540 --> 00:12:12,360
If I had a child, I would've told him to take Jun Ho's class.

191
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:13,830
Why?

192
00:12:13,830 --> 00:12:16,400
All the reasons are written there.

193
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:18,780
You'll develop a high-level thinking habits

194
00:12:18,780 --> 00:12:21,820
and it'll affect all the other subjects. Stuff like that.

195
00:12:21,820 --> 00:12:23,520
Is that so?

196
00:12:25,050 --> 00:12:29,760
But the question is whether he'll have chemistry with the students or not.

197
00:12:31,070 --> 00:12:32,940
Even if it didn't, it's just an academy.

198
00:12:32,940 --> 00:12:35,260
You can get a refund.

199
00:12:36,110 --> 00:12:38,630
There are no refunds.

200
00:12:42,950 --> 00:12:45,200
How interesting.

201
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:47,520
It's irresponsible nonsense.

202
00:12:48,810 --> 00:12:51,080
It's not nonsense.

203
00:12:53,830 --> 00:12:56,380
Sounds like passion.

204
00:12:59,570 --> 00:13:04,820
Do you know what I was told right before I submitted my resignation letter?

205
00:13:04,820 --> 00:13:07,170
 Can you... 

206
00:13:07,170 --> 00:13:09,620
 just do nothing? 

207
00:13:11,610 --> 00:13:13,380
 Please. 

208
00:13:15,950 --> 00:13:17,750
I'm sorry.

209
00:13:19,650 --> 00:13:22,810
I didn't bring that up to make you feel bad.

210
00:13:22,810 --> 00:13:26,370
Instead of lining the students up according to their grades,

211
00:13:26,370 --> 00:13:31,550
making them read and enjoy literature properly.

212
00:13:31,550 --> 00:13:37,450
And teaching them in our own way to achieve that.

213
00:13:37,450 --> 00:13:39,050
That's...

214
00:13:41,300 --> 00:13:44,270
probably every teacher's dream.

215
00:13:47,650 --> 00:13:50,150
Although, ironically,

216
00:13:50,150 --> 00:13:53,800
the academy is the place for it, not school.

217
00:14:00,250 --> 00:14:03,260
Looks like your friend waited too long.

218
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:07,360
I'll get going now.

219
00:14:22,940 --> 00:14:26,170
Please leave that there. We'll take care of it.

220
00:14:26,170 --> 00:14:29,520
- Let me pay.
 - No, it's okay.

221
00:14:29,520 --> 00:14:31,230
Good night.

222
00:14:52,020 --> 00:14:53,420
Mr. Pyo.

223
00:14:56,670 --> 00:14:58,900
I apologize...

224
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:02,210
for being rude earlier.

225
00:15:04,340 --> 00:15:06,390
It was fun.

226
00:15:08,780 --> 00:15:13,210
I haven't had so much fun in a while.

227
00:15:31,840 --> 00:15:36,570
So, his solution to defeat Choeseon Korean and

228
00:15:36,570 --> 00:15:40,910
your assistant director, who are trying to destroy you is—

229
00:15:40,910 --> 00:15:43,270
Right? He must be crazy.

230
00:15:44,620 --> 00:15:47,710
Or am I the crazy one?

231
00:15:49,260 --> 00:15:53,350
Everything he said makes sense.

232
00:16:06,760 --> 00:16:09,410
What I told you today...

233
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:12,590
I won't apologize for that.

234
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:15,910
Fine.

235
00:16:18,370 --> 00:16:20,320
We'll stop by somewhere.

236
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:21,760
Where?

237
00:16:21,760 --> 00:16:23,400
A beach.

238
00:16:25,740 --> 00:16:27,700
A real beach.

239
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:30,960
I'm really tired today.

240
00:16:30,960 --> 00:16:33,040
Lean the seat back.

241
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:36,510
I'll show you the sunrise when you wake up.

242
00:16:37,420 --> 00:16:39,780
You could sleep since the car is quiet.

243
00:16:39,780 --> 00:16:44,660
Who goes on a trip like this without any prep?

244
00:16:44,660 --> 00:16:47,570
When you threatened me not to get me a job—

245
00:16:47,570 --> 00:16:49,300
I never threatened you.

246
00:16:49,300 --> 00:16:52,480
You made me come to Namsan then.

247
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:56,030
You said, "Have a bigger perspective."

248
00:16:56,030 --> 00:16:59,690
Yes, I did.

249
00:16:59,690 --> 00:17:01,520
This is similar to that.

250
00:17:02,910 --> 00:17:07,450
I want to show you something big and refreshing.

251
00:17:08,750 --> 00:17:11,320
You have such a nice car,

252
00:17:11,320 --> 00:17:14,400
but you can't even remember what the ocean looks like.

253
00:17:19,050 --> 00:17:21,760
We can come back by tomorrow evening.

254
00:17:31,670 --> 00:17:34,410
I'm not going to drive.

255
00:17:34,410 --> 00:17:36,480
I think I made a mistake.

256
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:38,830
With what?

257
00:17:39,530 --> 00:17:44,190
Hye Jin almost switched jobs around last fall.

258
00:17:44,190 --> 00:17:46,470
Yes, she did.

259
00:17:46,470 --> 00:17:51,250
I should've persuaded her to switch then.

260
00:17:51,250 --> 00:17:53,160
Why didn't you?

261
00:17:54,520 --> 00:17:57,820
I think it was a morning on a weekend.

262
00:17:58,740 --> 00:18:01,860
She said she wouldn't join Choeseon Korean,

263
00:18:01,860 --> 00:18:05,540
and she came by to thank me for reviewing the contract.

264
00:18:06,420 --> 00:18:09,650
She was humming, by the way.

265
00:18:09,650 --> 00:18:11,570
- Hye Jin was?
 - Yes, can you imagine?

266
00:18:11,570 --> 00:18:12,870
No.

267
00:18:12,870 --> 00:18:15,010
I've never seen that.

268
00:18:15,010 --> 00:18:18,540
The air around her felt softer.

269
00:18:18,540 --> 00:18:23,820
I thought it was thanks to Mr. Lee. It was nice.

270
00:18:23,820 --> 00:18:26,510
She never had anyone to lean on.

271
00:18:26,510 --> 00:18:30,440
She's the money-making machine at the academy,

272
00:18:30,440 --> 00:18:33,900
and for the students, she's the grade-improving machine.

273
00:18:34,700 --> 00:18:38,110
It seemed like she was finally able to breathe.

274
00:18:38,110 --> 00:18:41,070
You were right.

275
00:18:41,070 --> 00:18:46,040
I didn't know her old student could change her that much.

276
00:18:46,040 --> 00:18:49,590
I don't know much about college preparation,

277
00:18:49,590 --> 00:18:52,700
but wasn't Mr. Lee right?

278
00:18:52,700 --> 00:18:57,970
That doesn't mean he could make a profit that way, though.

279
00:18:57,970 --> 00:19:01,910
You said you pitied her for being a money-making machine.

280
00:19:05,510 --> 00:19:09,810
Someone at the legal training institute begged me to introduce Hye Jin to him.

281
00:19:09,810 --> 00:19:11,390
I should've set them up.

282
00:19:11,390 --> 00:19:14,890
Come on. What a cocky lady you are.

283
00:19:14,890 --> 00:19:15,810
Me?

284
00:19:15,810 --> 00:19:19,370
You can't just force people to fall in love.

285
00:19:19,370 --> 00:19:23,690
How come you keep saying the right thing today?

286
00:20:08,800 --> 00:20:10,990
Right, the battery.

287
00:20:20,510 --> 00:20:22,910
Geez Louise!

288
00:20:22,910 --> 00:20:24,560
Did I wake you up?

289
00:20:24,560 --> 00:20:26,720
You should've woken me up.

290
00:20:31,460 --> 00:20:33,770
I wanted to see the sunrise.

291
00:20:33,770 --> 00:20:35,580
How pathetic.

292
00:20:35,580 --> 00:20:37,710
You aren't pathetic.

293
00:20:37,710 --> 00:20:39,650
I should've set an alarm.

294
00:20:39,650 --> 00:20:41,790
It's okay, I said.

295
00:20:43,150 --> 00:20:44,820
Let's get out.

296
00:20:45,620 --> 00:20:49,720
I wanted to get out, but I waited so I didn't wake you up.

297
00:20:54,350 --> 00:20:56,160
Seriously.

298
00:20:59,480 --> 00:21:01,940
This feels surreal.

299
00:21:01,940 --> 00:21:06,070
I was walking on the rainy streets of Gangnam a few hours ago.

300
00:21:07,010 --> 00:21:09,470
This feels like a different world.

301
00:21:09,470 --> 00:21:11,510
- Aren't you glad you came?
 - Yes.

302
00:21:11,510 --> 00:21:14,480
I didn't know I could just come here like this.

303
00:21:20,360 --> 00:21:23,650
I remember when we met in Namsan.

304
00:21:26,330 --> 00:21:30,370
I tried to change your mind, but it backfired.

305
00:21:30,370 --> 00:21:33,690
Backfired? Because of me?

306
00:21:33,690 --> 00:21:36,060
You threatened me, saying,

307
00:21:36,060 --> 00:21:39,410
"Is it okay if the academy knows you're doing this?"

308
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:45,800
I failed in Namsan, but your strategy worked.

309
00:21:47,680 --> 00:21:49,440
If so...

310
00:21:50,780 --> 00:21:53,060
Do what you want to do.

311
00:21:53,060 --> 00:21:55,730
Teach however you want.

312
00:21:57,800 --> 00:21:59,690
I knew you'd be on board.

313
00:21:59,690 --> 00:22:02,570
Although I would've kept pursuing it even if you weren't.

314
00:22:03,160 --> 00:22:05,490
- You were planning to go rogue? 
 - No.

315
00:22:05,490 --> 00:22:07,280
I would've kept persuading you.

316
00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:09,660
No matter how many days it took.

317
00:22:09,660 --> 00:22:12,030
I won't nag a lot.

318
00:22:13,980 --> 00:22:15,500
Be responsible.

319
00:22:15,500 --> 00:22:17,720
The students' lives are at stake.

320
00:22:17,720 --> 00:22:19,550
Of course.

321
00:22:20,850 --> 00:22:22,900
Do you need help with anything?

322
00:22:22,900 --> 00:22:25,580
You'd need a textbook first.

323
00:22:27,110 --> 00:22:29,010
No, not stuff like that.

324
00:22:29,710 --> 00:22:32,860
I want to do research and develop textbooks with you.

325
00:22:32,860 --> 00:22:36,100
I'm sure it'd be fun and amazing.

326
00:22:38,900 --> 00:22:40,750
No.

327
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:46,450
It wasn't easy to achieve what I have, and I won't be that easily persuaded by a few words from you.

328
00:22:46,450 --> 00:22:48,600
I definitely didn't build a sand castle.

329
00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:51,360
I never said it was easy.

330
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:55,280
I'm suggesting we make it more fun and meaningful.

331
00:22:55,280 --> 00:22:57,500
We can make the smartest students to come to us.

332
00:22:57,500 --> 00:23:01,300
Wake up. We aren't trying to raise students who'd be in textbooks.

333
00:23:01,300 --> 00:23:03,470
Just send them to Seoul National Univ. or medical school.

334
00:23:03,470 --> 00:23:06,170
I already have truckloads of students like that.

335
00:23:06,170 --> 00:23:09,880
But you have nothing. All you do is argue.

336
00:23:10,700 --> 00:23:12,680
The beginning is always the hardest part.

337
00:23:12,680 --> 00:23:15,480
So, stop wasting time trying to seduce me.

338
00:23:15,480 --> 00:23:17,320
There are many more things to do.

339
00:23:17,320 --> 00:23:22,620
♫  Oh the greatness I foresee  ♫

340
00:23:22,620 --> 00:23:27,430
♫  Just don't forget about me  ♫

341
00:23:30,340 --> 00:23:32,120
How pretty.

342
00:23:34,580 --> 00:23:39,210
One. Be very careful when setting someone apart in an organization.

343
00:23:39,210 --> 00:23:43,300
Once you do that, you don't know what they'll demand in the future.

344
00:23:43,300 --> 00:23:44,820
Yes, that's true.

345
00:23:44,820 --> 00:23:50,040
Two. Mr. Lee hasn't proven anything yet.

346
00:23:52,590 --> 00:23:54,590
He did a great job with the demo lecture.

347
00:23:54,590 --> 00:23:57,700
Most of all, he started a Huiwon High class.

348
00:23:57,700 --> 00:23:59,930
The demo was just a 10-minute lecture,

349
00:23:59,930 --> 00:24:04,380
and he had no chance of starting a Huiwon class without Seo Hye Jin.

350
00:24:05,320 --> 00:24:07,100
Last ...

351
00:24:07,830 --> 00:24:11,940
This is the biggest problem.

352
00:24:11,940 --> 00:24:14,680
Is it regarding the class focus?

353
00:24:14,680 --> 00:24:17,370
Expand the understanding of humanity and the world

354
00:24:17,370 --> 00:24:19,810
by learning how to understand literature.

355
00:24:19,810 --> 00:24:24,970
What kind of utter nonsense is this?

356
00:24:24,970 --> 00:24:27,280
You're right.

357
00:24:27,280 --> 00:24:31,190
If the academy allowed a classroom for a class like this,

358
00:24:32,220 --> 00:24:35,130
other lecturers would feel disappointed. Don't you think?

359
00:24:35,130 --> 00:24:39,320
Many count on you and follow your lead, Manager Kim.

360
00:24:40,300 --> 00:24:42,750
My goodness.

361
00:24:42,750 --> 00:24:48,590
I always learn so much from you, Assistant Director.

362
00:24:49,210 --> 00:24:50,600
You're too generous.

363
00:24:50,600 --> 00:24:55,450
I'll relay the message to Mr. Lee then.

364
00:24:59,140 --> 00:25:01,200
I need to go meet someone.

365
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:03,680
Yes, of course.

366
00:25:11,260 --> 00:25:13,980
By the way, the class proposal...

367
00:25:13,980 --> 00:25:17,190
Did Team Leader Seo approve it, too?

368
00:25:17,190 --> 00:25:19,210
I'm not sure.

369
00:25:20,780 --> 00:25:26,740
The Seo Hye Jin I know wouldn't have allowed that.

370
00:25:35,250 --> 00:25:37,620
Team Leader didn't get to see it.

371
00:25:37,620 --> 00:25:40,900
I came up with it on my own.

372
00:25:43,430 --> 00:25:45,290
I'll report to the Director directly.

373
00:25:45,290 --> 00:25:47,490
It's not that she thinks it's no good.

374
00:25:47,490 --> 00:25:50,410
She just thinks it's not the time yet.

375
00:25:50,410 --> 00:25:54,500
You need to listen to the higher-ups for now, okay?

376
00:25:54,500 --> 00:25:59,190
Don't rush into things and get singled out.

377
00:25:59,190 --> 00:26:00,620
I'm not disappointed.

378
00:26:00,620 --> 00:26:03,250
I knew she wouldn't allow it immediately.

379
00:26:03,250 --> 00:26:04,640
Yes.

380
00:26:09,050 --> 00:26:11,590
Yes, I know you tried your best.

381
00:26:11,590 --> 00:26:13,130
Not at all.

382
00:26:13,130 --> 00:26:16,170
I'll see you tonight. Okay.

383
00:26:22,620 --> 00:26:24,390
You scared me.

384
00:26:24,390 --> 00:26:27,670
- Why?
 - I thought you disappeared.

385
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:32,340
We should leave now.

386
00:26:40,060 --> 00:26:41,610
Seo Hye Jin.

387
00:26:47,190 --> 00:26:48,770
What?

388
00:26:48,770 --> 00:26:52,180
If we leave now, this would be basically a work trip.

389
00:26:53,850 --> 00:26:55,250
You're right.

390
00:26:55,250 --> 00:26:58,970
This is our first trip as a couple. We can do this much, right?

391
00:27:01,800 --> 00:27:05,430
I thought you would've left notes.

392
00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:11,950
This was neither homework nor an essay.

393
00:27:11,950 --> 00:27:13,950
You don't need my notes.

394
00:27:13,950 --> 00:27:15,340
Okay.

395
00:27:15,340 --> 00:27:17,120
But instead...

396
00:27:18,420 --> 00:27:23,150
I wrote something at the end of each review.

397
00:27:23,150 --> 00:27:24,200
Pardon?

398
00:27:24,200 --> 00:27:28,280
Your goal is to do well in exams no matter what.

399
00:27:29,320 --> 00:27:33,660
Modern literature, poetry, classic literature, lyrics,

400
00:27:33,660 --> 00:27:35,810
and essays.

401
00:27:35,810 --> 00:27:38,300
I wrote about how I recommend reading it

402
00:27:38,300 --> 00:27:42,110
and how I would've interpreted it if I were you.

403
00:27:42,870 --> 00:27:45,500
I wrote stuff like that.

404
00:27:46,500 --> 00:27:49,570
Read it later. Don't read it here.

405
00:27:55,800 --> 00:27:57,890
By the way, Mr. Pyo,

406
00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:03,410
I gave this to you yesterday. How did you already finish it...

407
00:28:04,380 --> 00:28:06,150
I stayed up all night.

408
00:28:07,080 --> 00:28:09,290
Thank you.

409
00:28:09,290 --> 00:28:13,160
Even so, It was enjoyable.

410
00:28:14,420 --> 00:28:17,290
You can leave. I'm busy.

411
00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:34,740
I take back the offer.

412
00:28:36,270 --> 00:28:38,180
What a shame.

413
00:28:39,370 --> 00:28:41,440
What will you do now?

414
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:45,090
You've been enduring pain for eight years and seven months.

415
00:28:45,090 --> 00:28:47,940
Do you want to wait a few more months?

416
00:28:47,940 --> 00:28:50,570
Only the order was changed.

417
00:28:50,570 --> 00:28:53,940
Instead of making a move after striking Seo Hye Jin's neck,

418
00:28:53,940 --> 00:28:57,110
I can aim for her neck from the outside.

419
00:28:57,110 --> 00:29:00,610
Korean department. Lee Myeong Jun, Nam Cheong Mi, and Kim Chae Yun.

420
00:29:00,610 --> 00:29:02,590
English department. Yun Ji Seok, Jang Il Do,

421
00:29:02,590 --> 00:29:05,220
Cheon Yi Chang, Kang Gi Ho, and Lee Geum Hyang.

422
00:29:05,220 --> 00:29:07,660
Social studies. Min Hui Ju.

423
00:29:07,660 --> 00:29:11,140
Lastly, there's Lee Jun Ho of the Korean department.

424
00:29:11,140 --> 00:29:16,420
But since he's on Seo Hye Jin's side, he's an exception.

425
00:29:16,420 --> 00:29:17,960
Is that pretty much it?

426
00:29:17,960 --> 00:29:21,620
The ones you'd be putting in your ark.

427
00:29:26,510 --> 00:29:31,610
Will Nam Cheong Mi or Kim Chae Yun take those files?

428
00:29:31,610 --> 00:29:33,530
Didn't I tell you?

429
00:29:33,530 --> 00:29:37,000
In the long run, we're competitors, too.

430
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:39,140
How could I disclose something like that?

431
00:29:39,140 --> 00:29:42,030
Don't think of me as your competition.

432
00:29:42,030 --> 00:29:46,690
Try using me in a more constructive way.

433
00:29:46,690 --> 00:29:51,110
If you bring those teachers to my academy,

434
00:29:51,110 --> 00:29:54,400
I'll do a lot for you in return.

435
00:29:54,400 --> 00:30:00,980
What would Choeseon Korean do with the English and social studies teachers?

436
00:30:00,980 --> 00:30:02,870
I should embrace all of them.

437
00:30:02,870 --> 00:30:06,490
It will be Choeseon Academy, not Choeseon Korean.

438
00:30:09,100 --> 00:30:16,680
But before that, how about you add another person to the ark?

439
00:30:18,170 --> 00:30:21,710
Do you mean Seo Hye Jin?

440
00:30:22,730 --> 00:30:27,230
Looks like I still can't get over her.

441
00:30:27,230 --> 00:30:33,380
Your goal was to separate Seo Hye Jin from Director Kim, anyway.

442
00:30:33,380 --> 00:30:35,560
Wouldn't that be good?

443
00:30:46,420 --> 00:30:48,260
Why? What is it?

444
00:30:48,260 --> 00:30:50,620
I have to see someone.

445
00:30:50,620 --> 00:30:53,690
You need to do something while I'm meeting this person.

446
00:30:53,690 --> 00:30:55,340
It's homework.

447
00:30:55,340 --> 00:30:57,860
After you drop me off,

448
00:30:57,860 --> 00:31:01,930
go straight to your parents' house. Sleep there tonight.

449
00:31:01,930 --> 00:31:03,150
I don't want to.

450
00:31:03,150 --> 00:31:06,140
It's homework, I said. You have no choice.

451
00:31:06,140 --> 00:31:08,200
Why do I have to do that?

452
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:12,210
Tell your parents what you think calmly and nicely.

453
00:31:12,210 --> 00:31:14,730
Make them feel better, too.

454
00:31:16,360 --> 00:31:18,960
I can manage that myself.

455
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:25,300
I want my boyfriend to be a good person.

456
00:31:25,300 --> 00:31:28,670
I'm tall, handsome, and rich. Doesn't that make me a good one?

457
00:31:28,670 --> 00:31:34,440
You said you'd teach the students how to read and enjoy literature properly.

458
00:31:34,440 --> 00:31:36,840
What does that have to do with me being a good boyfriend?

459
00:31:36,840 --> 00:31:39,760
Imagine a money-obsessed terrible son teaching the meaning of literature

460
00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:41,990
and the author's interiority.

461
00:31:41,990 --> 00:31:44,140
Wouldn't that be absurd?

462
00:31:48,060 --> 00:31:50,010
You'll do the homework, right?

463
00:31:56,660 --> 00:32:00,730
Why does my girlfriend have to be a teacher?

464
00:32:32,980 --> 00:32:34,650
Yes.

465
00:32:41,920 --> 00:32:43,480
Welcome, Team Leader Seo.

466
00:32:43,480 --> 00:32:46,740
- Am I late?
 - No, I just got here, too.

467
00:32:46,740 --> 00:32:48,940
I'm sorry to make you come a long way.

468
00:32:48,940 --> 00:32:50,380
There was traffic, right?

469
00:32:50,380 --> 00:32:53,090
No, I took the subway to avoid it.

470
00:32:53,090 --> 00:32:55,410
As I expected you are thorough.

471
00:32:55,410 --> 00:32:57,430
- Let's sit.
 - Okay.

472
00:33:00,840 --> 00:33:03,990
I said we'd order food later. That's okay, right?

473
00:33:03,990 --> 00:33:05,510
Yes.

474
00:33:10,050 --> 00:33:13,600
I should do this more often. But it's not easy.

475
00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:18,750
The teachers are so busy, and you're all competitors.

476
00:33:18,750 --> 00:33:21,130
It's hard to just hang out causally, too.

477
00:33:21,130 --> 00:33:22,660
Since it'd create rumors.

478
00:33:22,660 --> 00:33:26,650
You know how jealous everyone gets.

479
00:33:26,650 --> 00:33:29,610
So, I was surprised that you wanted to see me.

480
00:33:33,880 --> 00:33:39,580
Not only that, we're meeting far away from the academy so openly and suspiciously, right?

481
00:33:40,940 --> 00:33:45,500
Since you must've figured out everything already,

482
00:33:45,500 --> 00:33:47,560
mo need to beat around the bush, right?

483
00:33:47,560 --> 00:33:48,940
Yes.

484
00:33:49,840 --> 00:33:52,830
I'm preparing for retirement.

485
00:33:55,720 --> 00:33:59,390
I thought you could handle another decade easily.

486
00:34:00,150 --> 00:34:02,930
I can't.

487
00:34:02,930 --> 00:34:08,400
I used to know all the students' names, but I can't do that anymore.

488
00:34:08,400 --> 00:34:13,690
And it's not like I've done this forever

489
00:34:13,690 --> 00:34:16,930
like Director Choi, either.

490
00:34:16,930 --> 00:34:18,950
Does Director Kim know, too?

491
00:34:18,950 --> 00:34:20,590
Not yet.

492
00:34:21,410 --> 00:34:23,520
But interestingly,

493
00:34:26,570 --> 00:34:29,140
I received my retirement pay already.

494
00:34:30,540 --> 00:34:32,810
What do you mean by that?

495
00:34:39,920 --> 00:34:41,510
What is that?

496
00:34:41,510 --> 00:34:45,170
The entire class material of yours.

497
00:34:45,170 --> 00:34:47,640
Including the pop quizzes.

498
00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:07,100
Well, who...

499
00:35:07,100 --> 00:35:09,370
- How...
 - That's not important right now.

500
00:35:09,370 --> 00:35:13,080
What's important is that it's in my possession.

501
00:35:13,080 --> 00:35:14,680
Take it with you.

502
00:35:14,680 --> 00:35:18,430
You need to confirm if I'm bluffing or not.

503
00:35:18,430 --> 00:35:21,400
You're proudly telling me you made copies, too?

504
00:35:21,400 --> 00:35:24,180
I don't just have copies.

505
00:35:24,180 --> 00:35:26,990
You must have other ideas, too.

506
00:35:26,990 --> 00:35:33,000
You aren't as shocked as I thought you'd be about the USB drive.

507
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:35,110
Did you know, by chance?

508
00:35:38,670 --> 00:35:41,210
I wonder who tipped you off.

509
00:35:42,030 --> 00:35:44,180
Does that matter?

510
00:35:46,860 --> 00:35:50,240
No. The possible candidates would be

511
00:35:50,240 --> 00:35:52,510
the one who gave me these files

512
00:35:52,510 --> 00:35:56,580
and the one who wanted them badly. It's those two.

513
00:35:56,580 --> 00:35:59,770
What's important is that no one can use them.

514
00:35:59,770 --> 00:36:04,140
Shall we think about how we could make the most out of

515
00:36:04,140 --> 00:36:09,430
the work you created with blood, sweat, and tears?

516
00:36:23,930 --> 00:36:25,650
I...

517
00:36:27,590 --> 00:36:30,680
should leave the academy with you.

518
00:36:30,680 --> 00:36:36,790
Otherwise, these files will be given to someone else.

519
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:40,350
Let's eat.

520
00:36:40,350 --> 00:36:43,600
I'm hungry since I didn't have a proper lunch.

521
00:36:44,690 --> 00:36:47,070
I hope you respect it.

522
00:36:47,740 --> 00:36:49,440
I will.

523
00:36:51,480 --> 00:36:55,620
I thought you'd say more.

524
00:36:55,620 --> 00:37:00,310
You said it's about conscience and responsibility as an educator.

525
00:37:00,310 --> 00:37:03,610
How could I argue about that?

526
00:37:03,610 --> 00:37:08,000
I should honor it, no matter how disappointed I am.

527
00:37:09,020 --> 00:37:11,990
Okay, thank you.

528
00:37:12,660 --> 00:37:14,490
You can leave.

529
00:37:14,490 --> 00:37:17,750
You must be busy preparing for the free lecture.

530
00:37:46,300 --> 00:37:51,250
If I were Kim Hyeon Tak, I wouldn't treat you that way.

531
00:37:51,250 --> 00:37:55,910
He was able to buy my academy and get paid

532
00:37:55,910 --> 00:38:00,570
while loafing around, thanks to you.

533
00:38:00,570 --> 00:38:03,710
But I still owe him.

534
00:38:03,710 --> 00:38:05,920
It's not so easy to stab him in the back—

535
00:38:05,920 --> 00:38:07,500
You poor thing.

536
00:38:07,500 --> 00:38:10,670
Who stabbed you in the back first?

537
00:38:10,670 --> 00:38:14,000
You saw him trying to split up the Chanyeong High class.

538
00:38:15,420 --> 00:38:17,310
At the time that was really...

539
00:38:18,590 --> 00:38:20,380
disappointing.

540
00:38:27,150 --> 00:38:29,690
I think I need time to think about it.

541
00:38:29,690 --> 00:38:31,540
Of course.

542
00:38:32,490 --> 00:38:35,140
Did you decide whom you'd take with you, by chance?

543
00:38:36,040 --> 00:38:42,620
I'd only tell you that if you signed a contract with me.

544
00:38:42,620 --> 00:38:45,700
Will you possibly include Mr. Lee, too?

545
00:38:45,700 --> 00:38:47,480
If you want.

546
00:38:48,260 --> 00:38:51,490
There's something I want to test beforehand.

547
00:38:51,490 --> 00:38:54,790
I know there's a class he wants to teach.

548
00:38:54,790 --> 00:38:57,310
Yes, I was told about it. I said no.

549
00:38:57,310 --> 00:39:00,410
How about you let him teach that class?

550
00:39:00,410 --> 00:39:01,880
What would be the reason?

551
00:39:01,880 --> 00:39:04,550
I want to decide if I'd take him with me or not.

552
00:39:04,550 --> 00:39:07,460
He's a breath of fresh air,

553
00:39:07,460 --> 00:39:12,790
but it's a bit hard to control him as a subordinate.

554
00:39:15,990 --> 00:39:20,520
Not only you can't act, you can't lie, either.

555
00:39:20,520 --> 00:39:24,050
Everyone knows how tight you two are.

556
00:39:24,050 --> 00:39:27,890
You haven't heard the rumor yet?

557
00:39:27,890 --> 00:39:30,400
Mr. Lee and I...

558
00:39:31,300 --> 00:39:33,600
had a huge fight.

559
00:39:34,660 --> 00:39:37,620
Everyone is desperate to get a job there.

560
00:39:37,620 --> 00:39:40,680
How does it make sense to turn it down?

561
00:39:41,570 --> 00:39:44,690
Tell me. You're a good talker.

562
00:39:46,720 --> 00:39:48,720
You probably don't know, but—

563
00:39:48,720 --> 00:39:50,540
What do I not know?

564
00:39:50,540 --> 00:39:53,410
Just listen.

565
00:39:53,410 --> 00:39:55,750
He's talking.

566
00:39:57,950 --> 00:40:00,230
I respect both of you.

567
00:40:01,130 --> 00:40:04,210
Who told you to respect us?

568
00:40:04,210 --> 00:40:05,960
Just do what I say.

569
00:40:05,960 --> 00:40:11,010
I said a lot of hurtful things to you when I quit my job,

570
00:40:11,010 --> 00:40:14,640
but I'm not disregarding the lives you've lived.

571
00:40:14,640 --> 00:40:20,260
I know you've only been focused on raising us three brothers.

572
00:40:20,260 --> 00:40:21,800
But?

573
00:40:21,800 --> 00:40:24,990
"How could I possibly get more from them?

574
00:40:24,990 --> 00:40:29,500
Is there a way to live more easily riding their coattails?"

575
00:40:29,500 --> 00:40:35,110
I don't want to think that. I'm sad you don't understand that.

576
00:40:37,440 --> 00:40:42,120
Please trust me just this once and watch how I do.

577
00:40:43,740 --> 00:40:46,360
It's because I love and respect you.

578
00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:50,420
Okay.

579
00:40:50,420 --> 00:40:53,210
Get it together. What do you mean, "Okay"?

580
00:40:53,210 --> 00:40:55,930
He said he was disappointed.

581
00:41:01,460 --> 00:41:04,440
Mom, are you crying?

582
00:41:05,640 --> 00:41:08,140
Yes, she gave it to me.

583
00:41:09,380 --> 00:41:11,240
I did find out a few things.

584
00:41:11,240 --> 00:41:14,030
I think it was copied all at once recently.

585
00:41:14,030 --> 00:41:17,150
I can kind of tell when, too.

586
00:41:17,150 --> 00:41:22,380
I can try to catch the culprit by making it public,

587
00:41:23,870 --> 00:41:25,760
 but I won't. 

588
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:27,260
Why not?

589
00:41:27,260 --> 00:41:31,040
I'd just be catching her henchman by doing that. There's no point.

590
00:41:31,040 --> 00:41:35,510
It's more important to get what I want and stop her from using it.

591
00:41:35,510 --> 00:41:41,140
Since we're on the topic, we need to look like we don't get along for a while.

592
00:41:41,140 --> 00:41:45,710
Officially, we're a team leader and a member who had a fight and haven't made up yet.

593
00:41:45,710 --> 00:41:47,110
I have faith in you Team Leader Gi.

594
00:41:47,110 --> 00:41:50,240
- Please print it nicely. Thank you. 
- Sure.

595
00:41:50,240 --> 00:41:51,710
Let's go.

596
00:41:53,870 --> 00:41:56,780
Can we go get food now?

597
00:41:56,780 --> 00:42:00,160
I need to stop by one more place to get promotional products made.

598
00:42:00,160 --> 00:42:01,310
Are you hungry?

599
00:42:01,310 --> 00:42:03,820
No, I'm okay.

600
00:42:03,820 --> 00:42:06,010
So, what are the promotional products for?

601
00:42:06,010 --> 00:42:08,630
I'll get pens with my name printed on them.

602
00:42:08,630 --> 00:42:10,910
They're the swag for the students.

603
00:42:10,910 --> 00:42:13,650
Wow, you do all that yourself?

604
00:42:13,650 --> 00:42:17,500
It's easy to hire someone to do it, but it's expensive.

605
00:42:17,500 --> 00:42:20,450
I get to save money by doing it myself.

606
00:42:20,450 --> 00:42:22,020
How clever.

607
00:42:22,020 --> 00:42:24,210
I hear that often.

608
00:42:27,810 --> 00:42:29,680
Geez!

609
00:42:35,530 --> 00:42:37,010
Gosh.

610
00:42:37,610 --> 00:42:39,840
Did you see me just now?

611
00:42:39,840 --> 00:42:43,420
Yes, I did. Yes.

612
00:42:43,420 --> 00:42:45,070
Thank you.

613
00:42:46,350 --> 00:42:49,260
I deserve to be complimented.

614
00:42:49,260 --> 00:42:51,170
Didn't I look cool?

615
00:42:52,960 --> 00:42:54,890
You weren't too bad.

616
00:42:56,420 --> 00:42:58,870
 I got a lot of brownie points earlier, right? 

617
00:42:58,870 --> 00:43:03,580
 It must've been more effective than using words to seduce you. 

618
00:43:05,980 --> 00:43:07,680
I agree.

619
00:43:10,530 --> 00:43:14,940
We'll have a few more dates, right?

620
00:43:17,670 --> 00:43:19,210
Let's.

621
00:43:22,270 --> 00:43:24,510
I'm so curious.

622
00:43:24,510 --> 00:43:26,960
When will be our Day 1 as a couple?

623
00:43:28,850 --> 00:43:30,480
Today...

624
00:43:35,800 --> 00:43:37,420
Why are you so free today?

625
00:43:37,420 --> 00:43:39,840
Aren't grad students busy?

626
00:43:41,190 --> 00:43:45,320
I thought you meant today was our Day 1.

627
00:43:45,910 --> 00:43:47,420
It's winter break.

628
00:43:47,420 --> 00:43:49,670
It's okay to take a short break.

629
00:43:53,790 --> 00:43:56,980
By the way, that street is dangerous.

630
00:43:56,980 --> 00:44:01,100
You should go there with me or someone else.

631
00:44:03,170 --> 00:44:06,200
I don't go there that often.

632
00:44:09,010 --> 00:44:11,540
Is Lee Jun Ho done making his textbook?

633
00:44:11,540 --> 00:44:14,240
He made a kind of a strange one.

634
00:44:17,950 --> 00:44:20,320
There was a bit of a situation.

635
00:44:21,500 --> 00:44:23,180
Look.

636
00:44:25,140 --> 00:44:26,950
Team Leader.

637
00:44:27,660 --> 00:44:29,600
Mr. Lee Jun Ho.

638
00:44:33,150 --> 00:44:34,850
They exploded with each other.

639
00:44:37,050 --> 00:44:39,860
I don't want to know who won at all.

640
00:44:42,300 --> 00:44:44,940
I'm sure Lee Jun Ho won.

641
00:44:44,940 --> 00:44:48,860
No one can stop him once he makes up his mind.

642
00:44:48,860 --> 00:44:51,130
Let's go there afterward, then.

643
00:44:51,130 --> 00:44:52,740
Deal.

644
00:44:54,520 --> 00:44:57,480
Hello.

645
00:45:00,180 --> 00:45:02,530
Manager Kim, hello.

646
00:45:06,110 --> 00:45:10,510
 Wednesday morning, small classroom No. 2 by the lobby 

647
00:45:10,510 --> 00:45:14,080
The Assistant Director changed her mind.

648
00:45:16,570 --> 00:45:18,440
Thank you.

649
00:45:18,440 --> 00:45:21,030
You should've prepared it sooner.

650
00:45:21,030 --> 00:45:24,980
You'll be at a disadvantage since the students already scheduled their classes.

651
00:45:24,980 --> 00:45:27,480
That's why I wanted to start a small class.

652
00:45:27,480 --> 00:45:31,240
You would've had to give me a big classroom if I'd advertised it sooner.

653
00:45:32,250 --> 00:45:34,920
I like how confident you are.

654
00:45:34,920 --> 00:45:37,110
- Good day.
 - Thank you.

655
00:45:38,720 --> 00:45:40,370
- Hello.
 - Welcome.

656
00:45:40,370 --> 00:45:44,270
Manager Kim, what made you visit my team?

657
00:45:44,270 --> 00:45:47,310
I needed to speak to Mr. Lee.

658
00:45:51,560 --> 00:45:54,590
Have a nice day, then.

659
00:46:01,410 --> 00:46:03,370
Hold on!

660
00:46:05,410 --> 00:46:07,230
Thank you.

661
00:46:34,700 --> 00:46:36,550
Welcome.

662
00:46:42,730 --> 00:46:47,200
Won't people say we favor Mr. Lee?

663
00:46:47,200 --> 00:46:49,930
I liked him as a student.

664
00:46:49,930 --> 00:46:53,830
I do want to help him out,

665
00:46:53,830 --> 00:46:55,570
but why during the break?

666
00:46:55,570 --> 00:46:57,650
I think it has potential.

667
00:46:57,650 --> 00:47:01,780
I think Manager Kim checked out the content, too.

668
00:47:02,800 --> 00:47:07,350
You never know which class would become a hit.

669
00:47:07,350 --> 00:47:09,910
I hope it works out.

670
00:47:09,910 --> 00:47:11,540
Well, then.

671
00:47:16,650 --> 00:47:18,460
Have a look at it.

672
00:47:18,460 --> 00:47:21,340
You said our free lecture was your favorite lecture ever.

673
00:47:33,670 --> 00:47:39,950
Can this really prevent me from feeling anxious about exams?

674
00:47:39,950 --> 00:47:42,080
You're the one who'll be studying.

675
00:47:42,080 --> 00:47:45,280
I'll just be teaching the way I think is right.

676
00:47:47,600 --> 00:47:50,510
Take it with you and think about it.

677
00:47:51,970 --> 00:47:54,720
No, I'll take it.

678
00:47:55,520 --> 00:48:00,630
Mr. Pyo is really quitting his job at school.

679
00:48:02,330 --> 00:48:07,040
But I'm not interested in switching academies.

680
00:48:07,040 --> 00:48:11,270
Why are you telling me to check out a different class?

681
00:48:13,030 --> 00:48:16,560
I did all the homework

682
00:48:16,560 --> 00:48:18,790
and I get good grades, too.

683
00:48:18,790 --> 00:48:20,450
Mom likes you, too.

684
00:48:20,450 --> 00:48:22,370
That's why.

685
00:48:23,170 --> 00:48:25,450
You've taken my class since the prior learning class, right?

686
00:48:25,450 --> 00:48:28,300
After your mom did tons of research.

687
00:48:28,300 --> 00:48:30,830
- Yes.
 - But I think

688
00:48:30,830 --> 00:48:35,020
you think, make judgments, and act on your own.

689
00:48:35,020 --> 00:48:37,820
You're very good at that.

690
00:48:37,820 --> 00:48:39,960
Am I?

691
00:48:39,960 --> 00:48:42,060
I've never been told that before.

692
00:48:42,060 --> 00:48:46,640
No, you look quiet, but you don't get affected by your peers

693
00:48:46,640 --> 00:48:49,570
and you're good at finding what you need.

694
00:48:49,570 --> 00:48:52,470
That's how I see you.

695
00:48:52,470 --> 00:48:54,840
Thank you.

696
00:48:54,840 --> 00:48:56,490
No one ever told me that.

697
00:48:56,490 --> 00:49:00,410
That's why I thought you should check out other classes

698
00:49:00,410 --> 00:49:04,810
and make a decision yourself. I thought that'd be a good experience for you.

699
00:49:04,810 --> 00:49:08,050
If you're nervous, take it with Jeong Su and Ye Eun, too.

700
00:49:10,110 --> 00:49:12,910
Do you want to check out Mr. Pyo's free lecture?

701
00:49:14,130 --> 00:49:16,790
You don't have to if you don't want to.

702
00:49:17,860 --> 00:49:21,060
No, I'll check it out.

703
00:49:29,460 --> 00:49:33,930
 No. 1 formula, Daechi Choeseon Korean 

704
00:49:33,930 --> 00:49:38,320
 Aim for Level 1 

705
00:49:54,430 --> 00:49:56,390
It's Ms. Seo.

706
00:49:57,480 --> 00:50:00,260
- Yes.
 - What if she gets mad at us?

707
00:50:00,260 --> 00:50:02,650
She's not like that.

708
00:50:23,550 --> 00:50:27,120
 No. 1 formula, Daechi Choeseon Korean] 

709
00:50:40,150 --> 00:50:41,930
Let's go.

710
00:51:47,900 --> 00:51:49,620
Nice to meet you.

711
00:51:50,320 --> 00:51:55,280
I'm the pyosang* of Level 1, Pyo Sang Seob.
(Means "symbol")

712
00:51:56,480 --> 00:51:58,650
Today's lecture will be an hour and a half.

713
00:51:58,650 --> 00:52:02,500
It will be on trends in modern Korean literature.

714
00:52:02,500 --> 00:52:07,040
It's a free lecture, but from this point on,

715
00:52:07,040 --> 00:52:11,680
I'll make sure you never forget about what you learned.

716
00:52:23,700 --> 00:52:28,580
Usually, I make you stand in the back if you're late.

717
00:52:28,580 --> 00:52:32,250
But let's give her a pass since this is the first day.

718
00:52:32,250 --> 00:52:35,590
- You're okay with that, right?
  - Yes. 

719
00:52:35,590 --> 00:52:36,930
Are you ready?

720
00:52:36,930 --> 00:52:38,920
 Yes. 

721
00:52:41,140 --> 00:52:48,580
♫  Father rode the donkey to the market  ♫

722
00:52:48,580 --> 00:52:55,600
♫  Grandmother went to Uncle's house in the nearby town  ♫

723
00:52:55,600 --> 00:52:59,060
♫  Eat chili and say, mam-mam  ♫

724
00:52:59,060 --> 00:53:03,120
♫  Eat chive and say, mam-mam  ♫

725
00:53:03,120 --> 00:53:10,080
♫  Grandmother carried the doltteok (rice cake) on her head  ♫

726
00:53:10,080 --> 00:53:17,060
♫  Until she walks the windy path and comes back  ♫

727
00:53:17,060 --> 00:53:20,480
♫  Eat chili and say, mam-mam  ♫

728
00:53:20,480 --> 00:53:24,740
♫  Eat chive and say, mam-mam  ♫

729
00:53:29,610 --> 00:53:32,290
Who knows the original title of this song?

730
00:53:38,060 --> 00:53:42,440
The original title is "Song of the House Sitting Child."

731
00:53:42,440 --> 00:53:45,160
It came out in the 1920s,

732
00:53:45,160 --> 00:53:50,030
but it's a children's song that is spread orally in all regions.

733
00:53:50,030 --> 00:53:52,250
The keyword in this song is "chive."

734
00:53:52,250 --> 00:53:55,990
This chive isn't the herb we know of.

735
00:53:55,990 --> 00:53:58,720
It's actually supposed to be tobacco.

736
00:54:02,930 --> 00:54:05,310
You can look it up later.

737
00:54:05,310 --> 00:54:08,320
What you need to do now is to imagine.

738
00:54:08,320 --> 00:54:09,960
Okay.

739
00:54:11,260 --> 00:54:13,650
Let's imagine starting now.

740
00:54:14,240 --> 00:54:17,360
All the adults are gone to run errands.

741
00:54:17,360 --> 00:54:19,630
It's impossible to imagine now,

742
00:54:19,630 --> 00:54:22,840
but the child was left alone in the house.

743
00:54:22,840 --> 00:54:28,030
There were no TVs, cellphones, storybooks, or toys back then.

744
00:54:28,030 --> 00:54:29,830
The child is bored to death.

745
00:54:29,830 --> 00:54:33,560
He needs to try his best to find something fun.

746
00:54:35,200 --> 00:54:39,440
What caught his eyes was the chilies and tobacco

747
00:54:39,440 --> 00:54:41,890
lying around in the house.

748
00:54:42,580 --> 00:54:45,090
The child starts mimicking the adults.

749
00:54:45,090 --> 00:54:47,350
He tries eating the chilies

750
00:54:48,240 --> 00:54:50,360
and smoking tobacco.

751
00:54:54,910 --> 00:54:58,160
They're so powerful that it's making him dizzy.

752
00:54:58,160 --> 00:55:00,280
They're so spicy and strong he can't handle it.

753
00:55:00,280 --> 00:55:02,460
That's why he spins around where he is.

754
00:55:02,460 --> 00:55:05,120
Mam-mam-mam-mam-mam-mam.

755
00:55:05,120 --> 00:55:08,520
After eating the chilies, he goes, "Maoe (spicy)! Maoe! Maoe! Maoe!"

756
00:55:08,520 --> 00:55:12,950
After eating the chilies, he goes, "Maoe! Maoe! Maoe! Maoe!"

757
00:55:12,950 --> 00:55:15,110
♫  Eat chili and say, mam-mam  ♫

758
00:55:15,110 --> 00:55:18,220
♫  Eat chive and say, mam-mam  ♫

759
00:55:22,260 --> 00:55:23,830
What do you think?

760
00:55:24,730 --> 00:55:29,080
The verse that used to be meaningless suddenly became a vivid story. Do you agree?

761
00:55:29,080 --> 00:55:31,280
 Yes. 

762
00:55:31,280 --> 00:55:33,550
By switching "chive" to "tobacco,"

763
00:55:33,550 --> 00:55:37,180
the textbook producers tried to make it wholesome. Can you understand why?

764
00:55:37,180 --> 00:55:38,750
 Yes. 

765
00:55:38,750 --> 00:55:40,250
Okay.

766
00:55:40,880 --> 00:55:45,770
I said we'll learn about trends in modern Korean literature today.

767
00:55:47,720 --> 00:55:49,620
Try to answer me.

768
00:55:49,620 --> 00:55:52,510
What does "sa" in "sajo*" mean?
(Means "trend.")

769
00:55:52,510 --> 00:55:54,510
Sa as in death.

770
00:55:54,510 --> 00:55:56,110
Sa as in death?

771
00:55:56,810 --> 00:55:58,620
Spare me.

772
00:55:59,710 --> 00:56:03,390
- Me.
 - Feel free to guess.

773
00:56:03,390 --> 00:56:04,820
Sa, as in history?

774
00:56:04,820 --> 00:56:06,540
Sa, as in history?

775
00:56:09,750 --> 00:56:12,120
 Sa (Hanja, Chinese character) 

776
00:56:12,120 --> 00:56:14,960
- You mean this, right?
 - Yes.

777
00:56:14,960 --> 00:56:16,950
Does everyone agree?

778
00:56:16,950 --> 00:56:18,700
 Yes. 

779
00:56:18,700 --> 00:56:20,430
Good.

780
00:56:22,590 --> 00:56:25,580
Korea-Japan Treaty of 1910. Lee Gwang Soo's "Heartless," 1917,

781
00:56:25,580 --> 00:56:28,020
"Tae Seo Literary Magazine," 1918. "Creation," 1920.

782
00:56:28,020 --> 00:56:31,160
"Poetry and Literature," 1930. Etc, etc.

783
00:56:31,160 --> 00:56:36,580
You must've thought of this character since you memorized all that. But...

784
00:56:39,640 --> 00:56:41,770
this isn't the correct character.

785
00:56:49,220 --> 00:56:51,160
 Sajo 

786
00:56:51,160 --> 00:56:53,100
Sajo.

787
00:56:54,770 --> 00:56:56,450
This won't be in the exam.

788
00:56:56,450 --> 00:56:59,420
Don't try to copy the characters.

789
00:56:59,420 --> 00:57:01,690
Just pay attention to what I say.

790
00:57:01,690 --> 00:57:03,780
Sajo.

791
00:57:04,690 --> 00:57:06,540
If you look at each character,

792
00:57:06,540 --> 00:57:11,550
sajo means the flow of thoughts.

793
00:57:11,550 --> 00:57:14,050
Studying trends in literature means

794
00:57:14,050 --> 00:57:16,650
following the flow of the thoughts of the time.

795
00:57:16,650 --> 00:57:18,390
And it will also...

796
00:57:18,970 --> 00:57:22,440
allow your worlds to expand.

797
00:57:22,440 --> 00:57:24,700
Whether it's a poem or a novel,

798
00:57:24,700 --> 00:57:29,140
you have to get sucked into the author's world the moment you encounter a text.

799
00:57:30,870 --> 00:57:34,710
You need to have the same eyes, language,

800
00:57:34,710 --> 00:57:38,810
and thoughts of the author to face their world.

801
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:42,120
Between you, who's able to imagine a child

802
00:57:42,120 --> 00:57:46,110
who's eating the tobacco and chilies, and you, who can't,

803
00:57:46,110 --> 00:57:49,160
there's a river you can't cross. Which will lead to...

804
00:57:51,460 --> 00:57:54,870
I'm sorry to say, but it'd lead to a difference in grades.

805
00:57:56,370 --> 00:58:00,170
Since you're high-schoolers, let's start with something fitting.

806
00:58:00,170 --> 00:58:03,550
We'll start with Lee Gwang Soo's "Heartless."

807
00:58:03,550 --> 00:58:07,290
Open the first page of the handouts!

808
00:58:39,250 --> 00:58:41,900
You need to know this.

809
00:58:43,630 --> 00:58:46,580
A piece of literature in the textbook.

810
00:58:46,580 --> 00:58:50,250
A line of essay in the exam. All of them were chosen for a reason.

811
00:58:50,250 --> 00:58:54,070
The great scholars of Korea, college professors,

812
00:58:54,070 --> 00:58:58,070
and school teachers with decades of experience. Those experts

813
00:58:58,070 --> 00:59:01,460
deliberate and debate for a long time

814
00:59:01,460 --> 00:59:05,440
to choose the texts you absolutely need to read.

815
00:59:08,330 --> 00:59:12,780
For you, who only have middle school degrees.

816
00:59:14,540 --> 00:59:16,690
Describe "Heartless"!

817
00:59:16,690 --> 00:59:19,810
Published on Maeil Daily in 1917. The author is Lee Gwang Soo.

818
00:59:19,810 --> 00:59:21,420
The first modern novel series in Korea.

819
00:59:21,420 --> 00:59:24,370
Modern individuals and discovery of identity. Etc, etc.

820
00:59:24,370 --> 00:59:26,240
Geez.

821
00:59:28,010 --> 00:59:31,330
They don't want you to read this,

822
00:59:31,330 --> 00:59:35,140
so you blindly memorize stuff like this.

823
00:59:41,970 --> 00:59:44,830
The teachers who teach you now,

824
00:59:45,630 --> 00:59:48,100
and the professors who will be teaching you,

825
00:59:48,100 --> 00:59:51,390
want you to empathize

826
00:59:51,390 --> 00:59:55,490
with the conflicts and anguish of the people who lived in that time

827
00:59:55,490 --> 01:00:02,130
and expand your understanding of humanity and the world.

828
01:00:04,170 --> 01:00:06,500
When you encounter this piece,

829
01:00:06,500 --> 01:00:08,740
before you remember the facts about this piece,

830
01:00:08,740 --> 01:00:12,110
you need to get sucked into the protagonist, Yi Hyeong Sik's agony.

831
01:00:14,550 --> 01:00:16,480
Of course, it's not easy.

832
01:00:16,480 --> 01:00:20,790
I still can't forget how shocked I was when I first read this.

833
01:00:22,090 --> 01:00:24,330
It was freaking boring.

834
01:00:25,230 --> 01:00:26,910
But then...

835
01:00:27,790 --> 01:00:32,500
I decided to see this piece from a different perspective.

836
01:00:34,260 --> 01:00:39,370
I decided to sneak a peek at the diary of my eldest brother, who had been lost in thoughts lately.

837
01:00:39,370 --> 01:00:41,480
What's the protagonist, Hyeong Sik, worried about?

838
01:00:41,480 --> 01:00:44,420
Just who does he love at the moment?

839
01:00:44,420 --> 01:00:47,320
Is it Seon Hyeong or Yeong Chae?

840
01:00:50,270 --> 01:00:51,900
You know what?

841
01:00:53,140 --> 01:00:56,640
What's more entertaining than the diary of my oldest brother who's in a love triangle?

842
01:00:56,640 --> 01:00:58,210
Don't you agree?

843
01:00:58,210 --> 01:01:02,240
When I read this piece imagining that... Oh, my God.

844
01:01:05,700 --> 01:01:07,250
It was hella fun.

845
01:01:08,920 --> 01:01:12,940
There's no novel more entertaining than this in the world.

846
01:01:22,280 --> 01:01:25,800
 Literature 

847
01:01:33,220 --> 01:01:35,200
A piece of literature is like...

848
01:01:36,420 --> 01:01:41,590
a diary the author kept in detail after

849
01:01:41,590 --> 01:01:46,190
reflecting on their interiority for a long time.

850
01:02:15,630 --> 01:02:17,320
 Reading Training 

851
01:02:27,860 --> 01:02:30,370
Let me ask you for the last time.

852
01:02:30,370 --> 01:02:32,430
What you learned today is...

853
01:02:32,430 --> 01:02:35,390
 Flow of thoughts. 

854
01:02:35,390 --> 01:02:37,950
- What did you say?
  - Flow of thoughts. 

855
01:02:37,950 --> 01:02:39,600
Yes.

856
01:02:39,600 --> 01:02:43,870
Today, you swam in the thoughts of the public and great authors

857
01:02:43,870 --> 01:02:46,180
between 1910, the year the Japanese occupation started,

858
01:02:46,180 --> 01:02:50,350
and 1945, the year of Korean independence.

859
01:02:55,830 --> 01:02:58,280
I'm curious if you had fun.

860
01:02:58,280 --> 01:03:01,020
- We loved it. 
- It was fun.

861
01:03:02,240 --> 01:03:04,170
Thank you.

862
01:03:04,170 --> 01:03:09,330
That was the symbol of Level 1, Pyo Sang Seob.

863
01:03:20,570 --> 01:03:22,780
What was that?

864
01:03:22,780 --> 01:03:25,660
I was really worried since I heard he was quitting.

865
01:03:25,660 --> 01:03:27,680
I don't think I need to.

866
01:03:31,860 --> 01:03:33,590
Will you take his class?

867
01:03:34,520 --> 01:03:35,960
I'm not sure.

868
01:03:35,960 --> 01:03:38,740
Will you ask your mom and decide?

869
01:03:38,740 --> 01:03:41,310
No, it's not that.

870
01:03:41,310 --> 01:03:45,270
I can think and decide for myself.

871
01:03:45,270 --> 01:03:47,450
That was really fun.

872
01:03:47,450 --> 01:03:48,900
I should check the class schedule.

873
01:03:48,900 --> 01:03:51,900
- Should we check the schedule?
 - Let's.

874
01:03:58,720 --> 01:04:01,680
I learned so much today, Mr. Pyo.

875
01:04:01,680 --> 01:04:03,400
Thank you.

876
01:04:28,980 --> 01:04:31,390
 It's not nonsense. 

877
01:04:35,420 --> 01:04:37,920
 Sounds like passion. 

878
01:04:47,780 --> 01:04:49,300
 When are you coming back? 

879
01:04:49,300 --> 01:04:51,820
 I finished part one of the textbook. 

880
01:04:51,820 --> 01:04:55,660
 It's just two weeks worth, but I want to show it to you. 

881
01:05:27,470 --> 01:05:31,380
You're finally starting the class you wanted to teach so badly.

882
01:05:31,380 --> 01:05:33,700
The class has five students.

883
01:05:34,500 --> 01:05:37,020
It's the beginning of a legend.

884
01:05:37,020 --> 01:05:41,020
I wonder why you don't get scared.

885
01:05:41,820 --> 01:05:43,570
Get started.

886
01:05:45,010 --> 01:05:46,460
Okay.

887
01:05:52,890 --> 01:05:54,780
What are you doing?

888
01:05:56,230 --> 01:05:58,060
Mr. Lee.

889
01:06:02,240 --> 01:06:08,300
Starting now, don't make any noise, and look at that light.

890
01:06:41,320 --> 01:06:43,650
Model student, Seo Hye Jin,

891
01:06:43,650 --> 01:06:45,870
what did you see just now?

892
01:06:45,870 --> 01:06:47,500
A fox?

893
01:06:47,500 --> 01:06:49,250
And?

894
01:06:49,250 --> 01:06:52,390
A moth or a gnat.

895
01:06:52,390 --> 01:06:54,070
What did you hear?

896
01:06:54,870 --> 01:06:56,760
The wind.

897
01:06:58,450 --> 01:07:02,550
Those are the senses required from "How to Cross the Desert" by Seo Yeong Eun.

898
01:07:02,550 --> 01:07:07,750
This piece lets you experience the protagonist's perspective using various senses.

899
01:07:07,750 --> 01:07:11,590
You just experienced your senses getting

900
01:07:11,590 --> 01:07:15,160
very sensitive while feeling extremely nervous.

901
01:07:15,160 --> 01:07:17,640
Do you want me to prove it?

902
01:07:17,640 --> 01:07:19,410
Be quiet.

903
01:07:47,590 --> 01:07:49,540
 What's "appreciating"? 

904
01:07:49,540 --> 01:07:52,400
 The dictionary says it means enjoying, 

905
01:07:52,400 --> 01:07:55,960
 understanding, and assessing a piece of art. 

906
01:07:58,670 --> 01:08:02,650
 By "hieroglyphics," it means they modeled the characters based on shapes. 

907
01:08:02,650 --> 01:08:05,000
 Based on what shapes? 

908
01:08:08,430 --> 01:08:14,430
 That was my favorite Korean lecture  

909
01:08:14,430 --> 01:08:16,420
 I've ever attended. 

910
01:08:21,080 --> 01:08:22,770
 But... 

911
01:08:23,630 --> 01:08:26,730
 she's been keeping that the entire semester. 

912
01:08:26,730 --> 01:08:28,860
 I felt so humiliated. 

913
01:08:35,830 --> 01:08:37,560
Jun Ho.

914
01:08:37,560 --> 01:08:39,760
Focus on the sound of the wind.

915
01:08:42,870 --> 01:08:44,570
Lee Jun Ho,

916
01:08:46,050 --> 01:08:48,120
you win.

917
01:08:49,900 --> 01:08:52,010
You win.

918
01:09:15,470 --> 01:09:18,780
I want to finish the puzzle before the new semester starts.

919
01:09:18,780 --> 01:09:24,600
Of course, it might happen sooner or later, depending on your plan.

920
01:09:24,600 --> 01:09:27,200
Please give me a bit more time.

921
01:09:28,420 --> 01:09:30,530
I think I waited long enough.

922
01:09:30,530 --> 01:09:32,680
We're waiting for one more person.

923
01:09:32,680 --> 01:09:34,240
What?

924
01:09:36,840 --> 01:09:39,940
Who is it? I'm excited.

925
01:09:39,940 --> 01:09:42,160
You won't be disappointed.

926
01:09:56,080 --> 01:09:58,850
There she is. Another big fan of mine.

927
01:09:58,850 --> 01:10:00,990
Have a seat, Director Choi.

928
01:10:00,990 --> 01:10:02,550
Over here.

929
01:10:03,800 --> 01:10:05,360
We'll start our meal now.

930
01:10:05,360 --> 01:10:06,910
Okay.

931
01:10:12,230 --> 01:10:14,960
I told them to prepare two servings of food.

932
01:10:14,960 --> 01:10:17,400
I didn't think I should be here.

933
01:10:17,400 --> 01:10:21,160
I hope you two take your time and enjoy yourselves.

934
01:10:21,160 --> 01:10:22,820
Oh, and this.

935
01:10:23,850 --> 01:10:26,500
Discuss what to do with it.

936
01:10:26,500 --> 01:10:31,200
You can give it to someone, or you can put it on a billboard.

937
01:10:33,200 --> 01:10:38,360
Having my files won't mean a teacher could teach as well as I do.

938
01:10:38,360 --> 01:10:42,270
But you two are experts in discovering talent.

939
01:10:42,270 --> 01:10:45,030
I believe you can figure it out.

940
01:10:45,030 --> 01:10:47,540
I understand your position.

941
01:10:47,540 --> 01:10:49,330
Let's hear the reason.

942
01:10:49,330 --> 01:10:51,070
Now ...

943
01:10:55,090 --> 01:10:58,050
this is no longer my treasure.

944
01:11:00,050 --> 01:11:09,040
 Timing and Subtitles by Lessons in Love Team @ Viki.com 

945
01:11:23,150 --> 01:11:27,530
 The Midnight Romance in Hagwon 

946
01:11:27,530 --> 01:11:30,970
 You must've thought the game would be off if you gave up on these files. 

947
01:11:30,970 --> 01:11:32,740
 But we're just getting started. 

948
01:11:32,740 --> 01:11:37,390
-  Did you get caught? 
-  There'll be nasty rumors because it's me. 

949
01:11:37,390 --> 01:11:39,660
 - Seriously.
 - Seo Hye Jin can't come back. 

950
01:11:39,660 --> 01:11:42,500
 Would I have had a chance if I confessed my feelings? 

951
01:11:42,500 --> 01:11:46,380
 It means this academy will become a shipwreck soon. 

952
01:11:46,380 --> 01:11:47,730
 Will you deny it? 

953
01:11:47,730 --> 01:11:49,820
 That it's a false rumor or something like that? 

954
01:11:49,820 --> 01:11:53,080
 You'll get covered in sewer water. 

955
01:11:53,080 --> 01:11:54,510
 I'll splash it on myself. 

956
01:11:54,510 --> 01:11:58,580
♫  Can you catch me  ♫
