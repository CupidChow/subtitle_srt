 Analysis of Literature

You don't have the copies or anything like that, right?

18
00:01:09,790 --> 00:01:14,260
Even if you did, there's nothing we can do.

19
00:01:14,260 --> 00:01:17,280
It's not like we haven't been betrayed before.

Well...

21
00:01:20,270 --> 00:01:23,000
No, it's okay. You can leave.

22
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:28,940
Shouldn't you give me a receipt for returning the textbooks?

23
00:01:28,940 --> 00:01:30,130
What?

24
00:01:30,130 --> 00:01:33,480
What if you say you didn't receive them later?

 Lee Si Wu returned textbooks

Here. Happy? Go now.

00:02:17,070 --> 00:02:20,050
Why aren't you leaving?

30
00:02:20,050 --> 00:02:22,150
Sign this, too.

 Park Gi Seong

00:02:45,780 --> 00:02:47,560
Lee Si Wu,

33
00:02:51,790 --> 00:02:55,140
write that you won't release our textbooks.

 Episode 8  
 Here.

35
00:02:58,080 --> 00:02:59,570
What's this?

36
00:02:59,570 --> 00:03:04,290
I thought you should get a new tablet.

37
00:03:05,060 --> 00:03:07,050
Why would you...

38
00:03:07,850 --> 00:03:10,770
I bought one while I was getting a new phone.

39
00:03:10,770 --> 00:03:14,410
It looked pretty, and it reminded me of you.

40
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:18,190
Director.

41
00:03:18,190 --> 00:03:20,890
Come on. Take it.

42
00:03:24,300 --> 00:03:29,230
I got a job offer from another academy.

43
00:03:33,770 --> 00:03:35,280
Really?

44
00:03:36,370 --> 00:03:38,010
When?

45
00:03:39,640 --> 00:03:42,170
Recently, unfortunately.

46
00:03:42,170 --> 00:03:46,310
But take this, still.

47
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:51,120
There's such a thing as a goodbye gift.

48
00:03:53,450 --> 00:03:57,150
I want something bigger when it comes to that.

49
00:04:00,250 --> 00:04:02,670
- If so— 
 - I'm not leaving.

50
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:05,420
Really?

51
00:04:05,420 --> 00:04:09,150
- Should I?
 - No, it's not that.

52
00:04:09,150 --> 00:04:12,430
Give this to Nam Jeong Mi instead.

53
00:04:12,430 --> 00:04:15,530
- Ms. Nam?
 - She's working harder than anyone.

54
00:04:15,530 --> 00:04:19,850
Encourage the new teachers, too.

55
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:25,180
I knew I was right about you.

56
00:04:26,260 --> 00:04:29,450
Team Leader Seo, you're a superior person.

57
00:04:29,450 --> 00:04:32,100
You're caring and courageous.

58
00:04:32,100 --> 00:04:38,080
It's not that. I really want to grow the Huiwon High class.

59
00:04:40,460 --> 00:04:43,250
- I have a class soon.
 - Yes, you should get going.

60
00:04:43,250 --> 00:04:46,410
It's your busy day. I'm sorry.

61
00:04:51,420 --> 00:04:52,980
Wait.

62
00:04:52,980 --> 00:04:55,450
By chance,

63
00:04:55,450 --> 00:04:59,780
can you tell me where you got the job offer?

64
00:05:00,810 --> 00:05:02,880
What do you think?

65
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:05,610
- By chance-
- By chance?

66
00:05:05,610 --> 00:05:08,150
Choeseon Korean?

67
00:05:26,780 --> 00:05:30,830
Gray Witch, that cunning old woman.

68
00:05:30,830 --> 00:05:34,890
Send an announcement to the mothers of Chanyeong High.

69
00:05:34,890 --> 00:05:38,590
There's no special lecture for the finals this time.

70
00:05:39,910 --> 00:05:45,420
Can't another teacher still have a lecture instead of you?

71
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:47,910
Mr. Park.

72
00:05:48,700 --> 00:05:52,820
are you telling me to eat the crumbs right now?

73
00:05:54,750 --> 00:05:56,630
I'm sorry.

74
00:05:56,630 --> 00:06:00,760
Bring the Chanyeong High material I looked through last time.

75
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:03,340
Okay, I will.

76
00:06:04,010 --> 00:06:05,920
You can leave.

77
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:09,790
Okay. Well, by the way...

78
00:06:12,780 --> 00:06:14,000
Here.

79
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,310
What is it?

80
00:06:15,310 --> 00:06:18,280
Have a look.

81
00:06:24,710 --> 00:06:26,920
What's this?

82
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:31,440
I got it from Lee Si Wu when he came to return the textbooks.

83
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:33,810
I wonder if he's resentful because he's poor,

84
00:06:33,810 --> 00:06:36,590
or maybe he's overcompensating for his insecurity.

85
00:06:36,590 --> 00:06:38,340
He wasn't regretting his action at all—

86
00:06:38,340 --> 00:06:41,480
Did he write this of his own volition?

87
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:45,480
No, I told him to write it.

88
00:06:58,930 --> 00:07:00,630
Get out.

89
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:05,150
Hey.

90
00:07:09,820 --> 00:07:12,710
Honor, reputation,

91
00:07:12,710 --> 00:07:15,670
prestige, pride, or money.

92
00:07:18,030 --> 00:07:20,330
Which of those did you get out of this?

93
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:25,840
How dare you get this piece of crap in the name of Choeseon Korean?

94
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:27,820
From a kid?

95
00:07:27,820 --> 00:07:29,120
I'm sorry.

96
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:31,020
Get out.

97
00:07:31,020 --> 00:07:34,310
Get out of my face forever!

98
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:38,090
I-I'm sorry.

99
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:56,650
Teacher.

100
00:07:56,650 --> 00:07:58,390
Hey, how's everything?

101
00:07:58,390 --> 00:08:01,200
Did you see the class material I sent?

102
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:07,680
Yes, it's true. Ms. Seo seemed concerned.

103
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:10,270
It's not like I'm a kid.

104
00:08:14,350 --> 00:08:17,000
See you next week.

105
00:08:32,060 --> 00:08:34,840
 Study hard wherever you go. 

106
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:36,860
 I'll always support you. 

107
00:08:36,860 --> 00:08:39,590
 Choi Hyeong Seon of Choeseon Korean. 

108
00:08:42,490 --> 00:08:45,280
Is Team Leader Seo worried about something?

109
00:08:46,130 --> 00:08:49,030
It's about a Huiwon High student who's coming from Choeseon Korean.

110
00:08:49,030 --> 00:08:51,710
She saw him returning the textbooks.

111
00:08:56,550 --> 00:08:58,760
I should nag a bit.

112
00:08:59,660 --> 00:09:01,220
At me, do you mean?

113
00:09:01,220 --> 00:09:03,450
No, Team Leader Seo.

114
00:09:04,100 --> 00:09:07,500
I know she made up her mind, but going there openly

115
00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:09,660
would cause people to talk.

116
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:15,380
Why?

117
00:09:15,380 --> 00:09:19,210
I thought you knew her plan.

118
00:09:21,410 --> 00:09:25,300
She changed her mind.

119
00:09:28,570 --> 00:09:31,390
She told me she was going.

120
00:09:31,390 --> 00:09:34,980
You should hear directly from her. I don't want to speak for her.

121
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:39,340
Oh, okay.

122
00:09:41,820 --> 00:09:45,240
Oh, thanks for the information.

123
00:09:47,090 --> 00:09:49,820
Go home, you goofballs.

124
00:09:49,820 --> 00:09:52,410
- Good luck.
 - Thanks.

125
00:09:53,370 --> 00:09:56,830
 I'll wait for you until you're done with the morning class. 

126
00:09:56,830 --> 00:09:59,220
 I hope you come. 

127
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:04,840
Did you promise a ratio adjustment or other incentives?

128
00:10:04,840 --> 00:10:06,600
No.

129
00:10:11,930 --> 00:10:16,080
She apparently wants to focus on the Huiwon High class.

130
00:10:17,100 --> 00:10:19,400
How could that be the reason?

131
00:10:20,530 --> 00:10:24,430
I looked through her contract one more time.

132
00:10:24,430 --> 00:10:28,770
I made it difficult for her to take the students with her,

133
00:10:28,770 --> 00:10:31,910
but maybe you should warn her—

134
00:10:31,910 --> 00:10:34,590
- Assistant Director. 
  - Yes.

135
00:10:34,590 --> 00:10:38,980
We shouldn't be berating someone who's on our side right now.

136
00:10:38,980 --> 00:10:41,780
Berate?

137
00:10:41,780 --> 00:10:43,680
How could you say that?

138
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:46,500
Gosh, what a world.

139
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:48,940
The academy industry is like a jungle.

140
00:10:48,940 --> 00:10:50,370
That's what I'm saying.

141
00:10:50,370 --> 00:10:55,100
Especially at times like this, we should provide the teachers

142
00:10:55,100 --> 00:10:58,630
with unwavering trust and support. Don't you think?

143
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:24,810
We have ten minutes left. Should we look at another short text?

144
00:11:28,520 --> 00:11:30,350
Or not?

145
00:11:34,670 --> 00:11:39,890
But I highly recommend the text at the end.

146
00:11:39,890 --> 00:11:41,490
I knew it.

147
00:11:41,490 --> 00:11:45,090
You did, right? It's Erich Fromm's "The Art of Loving."

148
00:11:45,090 --> 00:11:50,340
"Love is the active concern for the life and the growth of that which we love."

149
00:11:50,340 --> 00:11:52,850
You can find that great sentence in there.

150
00:11:52,850 --> 00:11:57,290
It's proof of my deep love for you, right?

151
00:12:44,740 --> 00:12:46,290
Have you eaten?

152
00:12:46,290 --> 00:12:49,260
I'm full without eating right now.

153
00:12:50,450 --> 00:12:52,510
I brought a boxed lunch. Let's share it.

154
00:12:52,510 --> 00:12:54,500
It's for two people.

155
00:12:55,420 --> 00:13:00,010
I don't think you brought the other half for me.

156
00:13:00,010 --> 00:13:02,120
You're right.

157
00:13:02,120 --> 00:13:06,120
I won't return the favor for eating that, okay?

158
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:09,450
You sure are shrewd.

159
00:13:18,900 --> 00:13:24,440
The house will feel so empty once Jun Ho moves out.

160
00:13:30,470 --> 00:13:34,750
There's no point in working so hard to raise a son.

161
00:13:38,960 --> 00:13:42,070
 A captain named James Cook. 

162
00:13:43,970 --> 00:13:47,730
Looks like he's planning to come home early before he moves out, at least.

163
00:13:47,730 --> 00:13:49,970
He must have some conscience.

164
00:13:51,950 --> 00:13:54,200
- I'm home.
 - You're home early.

165
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:56,160
- I'm back.
 - What's that?

166
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:57,740
I wanted to start packing.

167
00:13:57,740 --> 00:13:58,820
Already?

168
00:13:58,820 --> 00:14:02,020
I don't want to wait until the class starts and rush.

169
00:14:02,020 --> 00:14:03,150
Hey, but still...

170
00:14:03,150 --> 00:14:05,360
I had dinner, Mom. I'll let you rest.

171
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:06,990
Good night.

172
00:14:08,930 --> 00:14:11,090
Give me the lunch box.

173
00:14:12,380 --> 00:14:13,990
What's that?

174
00:14:13,990 --> 00:14:17,640
I found a good side dish store.

175
00:14:19,460 --> 00:14:21,070
Look.

176
00:14:21,070 --> 00:14:24,400
I brought this from home since it's the best drinking snack.

177
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:26,780
But I didn't know you wouldn't be drinking.

178
00:14:26,780 --> 00:14:30,780
Sorry. My throat gets dry if I drink when I have a morning class.

179
00:14:30,780 --> 00:14:34,180
You're so unbelievable.

180
00:14:34,180 --> 00:14:38,030
By the way, why did you want to see me on the weekend?

181
00:14:38,030 --> 00:14:41,660
For some reason, I didn't want to go back to the empty house tonight.

182
00:14:41,660 --> 00:14:44,040
Do you feel lonely, too?

183
00:14:44,040 --> 00:14:46,740
Do you think I'm not a human?

184
00:14:46,740 --> 00:14:51,830
Should we start working on the blind date project again?

185
00:14:53,330 --> 00:14:57,880
Should I? I'll get you the ones with the best qualifications.

186
00:14:57,880 --> 00:15:00,210
I'm too old.

187
00:15:01,250 --> 00:15:04,000
I don't deserve to be in a relationship.

188
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:07,270
Hey, even people in nursing homes date,

189
00:15:07,270 --> 00:15:11,340
have love interests, and love triangles. Don't you know?

190
00:15:11,340 --> 00:15:16,010
Even when I go to a nursing home, I won't be a center of romance.

191
00:15:16,010 --> 00:15:18,760
I think I'll just watch others' romance.

192
00:15:20,610 --> 00:15:23,410
Why would you say something so scary?

193
00:15:23,410 --> 00:15:26,530
I don't know. I feel like that stuff has nothing to do with me.

194
00:15:26,530 --> 00:15:28,130
Why?

195
00:15:29,310 --> 00:15:31,330
Why?

196
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:37,550
Why? Why? Why? Why?

197
00:15:38,490 --> 00:15:40,150
I think...

198
00:15:42,010 --> 00:15:45,290
my cogwheels are misaligned.

199
00:15:45,290 --> 00:15:47,090
What cogwheels?

200
00:15:48,190 --> 00:15:51,940
People around the same age tend to

201
00:15:51,940 --> 00:15:55,410
have similar tasks they're facing, you know.

202
00:15:55,410 --> 00:15:58,220
Entering college is the priority until high school.

203
00:15:58,220 --> 00:16:01,890
Studying or dating is important in college.

204
00:16:01,890 --> 00:16:05,500
You worry about getting a job when you're about to graduate,

205
00:16:05,500 --> 00:16:07,750
- and when that's set, you start considering marriage. 
-  Yes.

206
00:16:07,750 --> 00:16:11,020
And if you get married and have a kid, you worry about the college entrance again.

207
00:16:11,020 --> 00:16:15,060
That's right. But when my college classmates were studying and dating,

208
00:16:15,060 --> 00:16:20,370
I worked my butt off to make money. I hadn't even graduated when you took the bar exam.

209
00:16:21,130 --> 00:16:23,070
Seriously.

210
00:16:23,070 --> 00:16:28,050
The debt collectors were after us every day, but my brother hadn't finished his studies.

211
00:16:28,050 --> 00:16:31,120
When I was free from debt,

212
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:34,060
I started prioritizing my students' college entrance. So

213
00:16:34,060 --> 00:16:37,720
my clock was a bit out of sync with others, right?

214
00:16:37,720 --> 00:16:43,310
So, you think you'll continue to be out of sync until you go to the nursing home?

215
00:16:43,310 --> 00:16:47,310
I've been working hard

216
00:16:47,310 --> 00:16:49,900
on each task in my life,

217
00:16:49,900 --> 00:16:52,970
but I never got to have a proper relationship. It's unfair.

218
00:16:52,970 --> 00:16:55,800
I'm just saying it's unfair.

219
00:16:55,800 --> 00:16:58,470
You sound really cowardly right now.

220
00:16:59,750 --> 00:17:03,930
I passed the first round of the bar exam when I was hot and heavy with my husband.

221
00:17:03,930 --> 00:17:05,710
Don't you remember?

222
00:17:06,500 --> 00:17:08,080
Right.

223
00:17:08,890 --> 00:17:10,800
I remember.

224
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:13,100
It was a hot summer.

225
00:17:13,100 --> 00:17:17,170
Not only was there no AC but there was no soundproofing in that tiny student apartment.

226
00:17:17,170 --> 00:17:21,610
- So crazy.
 - It was so sticky and hot.

227
00:17:21,610 --> 00:17:25,140
For some reason, I didn't want to wear even the thinnest clothes.

228
00:17:25,140 --> 00:17:26,210
Seriously.

229
00:17:26,210 --> 00:17:28,210
- It didn't matter who initiated— 
 - Stop, stop, stop.

230
00:17:28,210 --> 00:17:31,670
- I was like—
 - Stop! Why do I have to listen to this?

231
00:17:31,670 --> 00:17:33,810
Drink. Drink.

232
00:17:35,090 --> 00:17:40,680
You had to mature faster than others,

233
00:17:40,680 --> 00:17:45,840
but I don't think that's why you didn't get to date.

234
00:17:47,010 --> 00:17:48,520
What is it, then?

235
00:17:49,910 --> 00:17:55,060
You're either a fool who has too many expectations for love,

236
00:17:56,510 --> 00:17:59,350
or a fool who looked down on love too much.

237
00:18:02,460 --> 00:18:04,820
Which one do you think I am?

238
00:18:04,820 --> 00:18:06,790
You looked down on it.

239
00:18:08,450 --> 00:18:13,510
I'm really impressed you paid off that much debt at a young age,

240
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:16,710
but you became pretty successful, too. Money, car, and home.

241
00:18:16,710 --> 00:18:18,970
Money, car, and home.

242
00:18:18,970 --> 00:18:23,060
You got everything people value, one by one.

243
00:18:23,060 --> 00:18:26,080
It's easy to even fool yourself

244
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:29,020
by saying, "I don't need love."

245
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:31,840
I pretended to be cool a lot.

246
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:33,340
Yes.

247
00:18:33,340 --> 00:18:38,710
After being like that, it gets a bit embarrassing to say,

248
00:18:38,710 --> 00:18:43,070
"I want to be in love, too."

249
00:18:43,070 --> 00:18:47,080
That's why you have no choice but to lie to yourself again.

250
00:18:48,500 --> 00:18:50,110
But...

251
00:18:51,260 --> 00:18:54,170
what if I keep lying to myself,

252
00:18:55,680 --> 00:18:59,550
but I don't buy the lie anymore?

253
00:18:59,550 --> 00:19:01,750
What do I do then?

254
00:19:05,480 --> 00:19:08,050
Does this have to do

255
00:19:08,050 --> 00:19:10,980
with what you mentioned before?

256
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:15,670
You said you can't go back to the past anymore.

257
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:20,690
Just one can would be okay, right?

258
00:19:28,910 --> 00:19:30,530
Tasty.

259
00:19:57,140 --> 00:20:01,510
It really could've been dangerous today. You know I've been acting like his mentor.

260
00:20:01,510 --> 00:20:05,570
But I almost had lunch with him after I finished the class early today.

261
00:20:05,570 --> 00:20:07,410
It was so hard to hold back.

262
00:20:07,410 --> 00:20:10,990
So what if you have a lunch with him?

263
00:20:10,990 --> 00:20:15,140
Hey, I was once his teacher. I can't get seduced by him.

264
00:20:15,140 --> 00:20:19,900
At least I need to step on the brake.

265
00:20:22,630 --> 00:20:24,850
He has a lot going for him.

266
00:20:27,220 --> 00:20:29,500
He's fun,

267
00:20:29,500 --> 00:20:31,710
sweet,

268
00:20:31,710 --> 00:20:33,720
and responsible.

269
00:20:35,350 --> 00:20:39,400
My job is to help him reach his goal.

270
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:43,040
I don't want him to get involved in a silly rumor.

271
00:20:44,330 --> 00:20:45,980
Aren't I so cool?

272
00:20:45,980 --> 00:20:48,070
Okay, okay, okay.

273
00:20:48,070 --> 00:20:52,720
I understand why you want to think that.

274
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:55,060
But...

275
00:20:55,060 --> 00:20:58,870
But you said you can't fool yourself anymore.

276
00:21:00,750 --> 00:21:05,250
How do you really feel? Huh?

277
00:21:30,630 --> 00:21:32,860
You've seen him, right?

278
00:21:32,860 --> 00:21:34,760
I've seen him.

279
00:21:37,750 --> 00:21:39,970
How could you...

280
00:21:44,630 --> 00:21:47,190
not like Jun Ho?

281
00:21:52,430 --> 00:21:55,090
Tell me if there's a way to resist.

282
00:22:06,600 --> 00:22:10,070
Wow, I had this.

283
00:22:23,250 --> 00:22:24,800
Why are you crying?

284
00:22:24,800 --> 00:22:27,260
I don't know.

285
00:22:27,260 --> 00:22:29,620
Gosh, I'm drunk.

286
00:22:32,440 --> 00:22:35,160
I suddenly got scared.

287
00:22:35,160 --> 00:22:37,340
Why? About what?

288
00:22:37,340 --> 00:22:39,280
Well...

289
00:22:41,310 --> 00:22:47,470
He says I'm his first love.

290
00:22:47,470 --> 00:22:49,440
If he knew how lame I was

291
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:53,680
he'd stop fantasizing about me completely.

292
00:22:53,680 --> 00:22:59,030
Hey, why do you want to be fantasized about?

293
00:22:59,030 --> 00:23:03,570
Just give in to your desire.

294
00:23:03,570 --> 00:23:06,220
It's not so easy.

295
00:23:09,090 --> 00:23:11,920
How frustrating. Geez.

296
00:23:16,450 --> 00:23:18,690
I already know this is Jun Ho.

297
00:23:18,690 --> 00:23:21,710
- Can you bet a million won? 
 - Yes.

298
00:23:21,710 --> 00:23:24,050
How do you know?

299
00:23:24,050 --> 00:23:26,060
"Did you get off work?

300
00:23:26,060 --> 00:23:29,030
Did you get home safely? When will you go to bed?"

301
00:23:29,030 --> 00:23:32,260
He's the only one who asks me stuff like that.

302
00:23:32,260 --> 00:23:35,400
Thanks to him, I learned what it's like to be lonely.

303
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:37,600
Why would you be lonely?

304
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:41,970
I'm jealous you get texts from a young man at night.

305
00:23:41,970 --> 00:23:46,750
Right. It feels so empty if I don't hear from him at night.

306
00:23:49,500 --> 00:23:51,350
He's probably asking if I got home safely.

307
00:23:51,350 --> 00:23:53,830
I didn't get to see him tonight.

308
00:24:03,710 --> 00:24:05,640
Why? What is it?

309
00:24:07,500 --> 00:24:11,010
I won't demand a million won. Who is it?

310
00:24:14,220 --> 00:24:15,940
It's Jun Ho.

311
00:24:17,230 --> 00:24:18,920
So?

312
00:24:25,410 --> 00:24:26,990
What?

313
00:24:28,790 --> 00:24:32,310
 These are the notes you gave me. 

314
00:24:32,310 --> 00:24:35,190
 Seo Hye Jin, the tenacious woman. 

315
00:24:35,190 --> 00:24:39,360
 You worked so hard to make me study. 

316
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:41,740
 The day I studied hard. 

317
00:24:41,740 --> 00:24:44,960
 The day I skipped the class and went to the internet cafe. 

318
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:47,870
 The day I did well on the exam. The day I did poorly. 

319
00:24:47,870 --> 00:24:51,150
 The hot day. The cold day. 

320
00:24:51,150 --> 00:24:54,040
 The day we found a fun book at the library. 

321
00:24:54,040 --> 00:24:56,800
 The day we rented a comic book together. 

322
00:24:56,800 --> 00:24:59,580
 The day we solved a math exam together. 

323
00:24:59,580 --> 00:25:03,370
 The day we started to countdown until the exam day. The day before the exam. 

324
00:25:03,370 --> 00:25:05,490
 The day I took the entrance exam. 

325
00:25:05,490 --> 00:25:08,230
 The day I got the acceptance letter and... 

326
00:25:09,370 --> 00:25:12,280
 even when nothing was going on, 

327
00:25:12,280 --> 00:25:15,680
 you must've had a lot to say to me. 

328
00:25:17,210 --> 00:25:21,400
Why are you crying? Huh?

329
00:25:25,830 --> 00:25:29,150
Wow, you were a good teacher.

330
00:25:29,150 --> 00:25:31,590
I wasn't a good teacher.

331
00:25:31,590 --> 00:25:35,750
No, he's saying

332
00:25:35,750 --> 00:25:40,690
he endured a difficult time in his life thanks to you.

333
00:25:40,690 --> 00:25:42,320
This is basically...

334
00:25:42,320 --> 00:25:44,760
I didn't do that for other students.

335
00:25:44,760 --> 00:25:46,570
What?

336
00:25:46,570 --> 00:25:49,360
I only did that for Jun Ho.

337
00:25:53,230 --> 00:25:57,330
After I took a break from school,

338
00:25:57,330 --> 00:26:00,220
I didn't want to live.

339
00:26:00,220 --> 00:26:03,670
When you guys went on a school trip, studied,

340
00:26:03,670 --> 00:26:06,630
and went on dates, I...

341
00:26:06,630 --> 00:26:13,000
handed out... flyers in the morning, cleaned during the day and taught at night.

342
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:14,790
I...

343
00:26:19,430 --> 00:26:24,750
I thought I'd go crazy because life was so hard.

344
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:32,870
But I stopped thinking that at some point.

345
00:26:34,500 --> 00:26:37,260
It wasn't that my life improved.

346
00:26:38,520 --> 00:26:42,780
I just felt really good on some days.

347
00:26:43,920 --> 00:26:46,420
Not because I made money.

348
00:26:47,800 --> 00:26:54,150
It's that... when things felt hopeless,

349
00:26:55,960 --> 00:26:58,850
I hung in there because of him, I think.

350
00:26:58,850 --> 00:27:03,360
♫  You walked in my door  ♫

351
00:27:05,750 --> 00:27:11,960
 I'm not waking you up because it looks like you had a very long day 

352
00:27:11,960 --> 00:27:17,650
♫  ... a star above the clouds  ♫

353
00:27:17,650 --> 00:27:22,960
♫  I knew it then  ♫

354
00:27:24,270 --> 00:27:29,890
♫  I know it now  ♫

355
00:27:31,640 --> 00:27:35,880
 I'm so glad you started to enjoy reading 

356
00:27:37,890 --> 00:27:40,290
 I'm so glad you started to enjoy reading 

357
00:27:40,290 --> 00:27:42,740
 Congratulations, you've been accepted 

358
00:27:42,740 --> 00:27:50,020
♫  Years ago I let you pass me by, but now's our time  ♫

359
00:27:50,020 --> 00:27:52,580
 I got in! 

360
00:27:52,580 --> 00:28:01,900
♫  You walked in my door, and the love I had for you before  ♫

361
00:28:01,900 --> 00:28:10,240
♫  Came shining through just like a star above the clouds  ♫

362
00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:15,710
♫  I knew it then  ♫

363
00:28:16,890 --> 00:28:21,200
♫  I know it now  ♫

364
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:28,300
 Thank you for working hard for the last three years 
 ♫  I know it now  ♫ 

365
00:28:30,170 --> 00:28:34,590
 Seo Hye Jin 

366
00:28:38,440 --> 00:28:42,630
Hey, answer it. It's Lee Jun Ho.

367
00:28:42,630 --> 00:28:45,510
- Answer it.
 - How could I answer it?

368
00:28:52,290 --> 00:28:56,150
- Hello? Mr. Lee.
 - Hold on.

369
00:28:56,150 --> 00:29:00,290
- Yes, this is Cha So Yeong. Yes.
 - Give it.

370
00:29:00,290 --> 00:29:03,770
Yes, we've met before, right?

371
00:29:14,100 --> 00:29:16,160
I...

372
00:29:16,870 --> 00:29:19,780
Did he hang up?

373
00:29:19,780 --> 00:29:22,970
You must be crazy.

374
00:29:22,970 --> 00:29:26,480
- Hey, come here for a second.
 - Oh, no...

375
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:28,860
- I'll send him a text.
 - Don't do it.

376
00:29:28,860 --> 00:29:30,410
- Wait.
 - Don't do it.

377
00:29:30,410 --> 00:29:32,680
We're too drunk right now.

378
00:29:32,680 --> 00:29:35,150
Wait. Wait.

379
00:29:35,150 --> 00:29:39,540
I need to go home now. I'll go home.

380
00:29:39,540 --> 00:29:41,410
What's going on here?

381
00:29:41,410 --> 00:29:43,910
Give me that. I can get a ride home.

382
00:29:43,910 --> 00:29:47,750
No, I'll make my old man pick me up.

383
00:29:47,750 --> 00:29:51,180
My phone. Where's my phone?

384
00:29:51,180 --> 00:29:55,380
- Give me that.
 - I'll make my old man pick me up.

385
00:29:55,380 --> 00:29:58,170
We'll be all lovey-dovey on the way back.

386
00:29:58,170 --> 00:30:00,430
How could I just put you in a cab?

387
00:30:00,430 --> 00:30:02,690
You're out of your mind.

388
00:30:02,690 --> 00:30:05,420
Hello? Hey.

389
00:30:05,420 --> 00:30:08,760
I think you need to come over here.

390
00:30:08,760 --> 00:30:10,430
Who are you talking to right now?

391
00:30:10,430 --> 00:30:12,170
- You're talking to Jun Ho, aren't you?
 - No.

392
00:30:12,170 --> 00:30:13,820
- It's Jun Ho, isn't it?
 - I told you I wasn't!

393
00:30:13,820 --> 00:30:16,250
Give it!

394
00:30:16,250 --> 00:30:17,940
Here, there, somewhere! Where's my cell?

395
00:30:17,940 --> 00:30:21,010
Dear, there's a fabulous couple right here.

396
00:30:21,010 --> 00:30:24,120
- A fabulous couple is about to be born—
 - Stop it!

397
00:30:24,120 --> 00:30:25,830
It's a crucial moment.

398
00:30:25,830 --> 00:30:30,220
Come on. You should've drunk alone. Why ...

399
00:30:30,220 --> 00:30:34,440
Okay. There's one table left.

400
00:30:34,440 --> 00:30:36,180
Okay, okay.

401
00:30:36,180 --> 00:30:38,080
Yes, okay, okay.

402
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:41,370
Okay, okay. Okay, I will.

403
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:50,880
Sir.

404
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:53,070
Sir?

405
00:30:53,070 --> 00:30:55,920
I'm sorry, but we're closing.

406
00:31:00,620 --> 00:31:02,290
I'm sorry.

407
00:31:20,630 --> 00:31:22,940
Huh? Mr. Lee, hello.

408
00:31:22,940 --> 00:31:25,320
Oh, hello.

409
00:31:25,320 --> 00:31:27,640
- Nice to see you here.
 - Yes, yes. Hello.

410
00:31:27,640 --> 00:31:30,320
- You're here to see Seo Hye Jin, right?
 - Yes.

411
00:31:30,320 --> 00:31:32,640
- Let's go.
 - Okay.

412
00:31:56,390 --> 00:31:58,440
Hey, be careful.

413
00:31:58,440 --> 00:32:00,120
Watch your head.

414
00:32:09,900 --> 00:32:11,690
- Get home safely.
 - I will.

415
00:32:11,690 --> 00:32:13,180
I'll buy you a drink next time.

416
00:32:13,180 --> 00:32:15,330
Sounds good. I'll look forward to it.

417
00:32:15,330 --> 00:32:17,710
- Okay.
 - By the way,

418
00:32:17,710 --> 00:32:21,590
I'm not sure if I should tell you this, but...

419
00:32:40,650 --> 00:32:43,700
Gosh, you really are a pro.

420
00:32:43,700 --> 00:32:46,050
Aigoo, you did a great thing.

421
00:32:46,050 --> 00:32:48,040
She has a class tomorrow morning.

422
00:32:48,040 --> 00:32:52,300
You'd be shocked if you knew what I did just now.

423
00:32:52,300 --> 00:32:55,710
Aigoo, don't be so proud.

424
00:32:55,710 --> 00:32:58,680
They would've worked out even if it weren't for you.

425
00:32:58,680 --> 00:33:02,030
What? Did you know they were like that?

426
00:33:02,030 --> 00:33:04,070
Seriously.

427
00:33:04,070 --> 00:33:05,800
How?

428
00:33:05,800 --> 00:33:09,840
I knew it the day she first brought him.

429
00:33:11,220 --> 00:33:14,370
Wow, Seo Hye Jin really is a fool.

430
00:33:14,370 --> 00:33:18,400
It's so obvious to everyone. How come she's the only one in the dark?

431
00:33:18,400 --> 00:33:21,680
It happens when it comes to you.

432
00:33:21,680 --> 00:33:25,500
I didn't know there was probation in love, too.

433
00:33:25,500 --> 00:33:27,800
That sounds like a pop song.

434
00:33:27,800 --> 00:33:31,690
♫  I didn't know there was probation in love  ♫

435
00:33:31,690 --> 00:33:35,670
I hope they have the greatest love affair.

436
00:33:35,670 --> 00:33:38,450
Go all in.

437
00:34:03,190 --> 00:34:04,330
Be careful.

438
00:34:04,330 --> 00:34:06,770
 - The door is closing. 
 - Gosh.

439
00:34:24,600 --> 00:34:27,810
You can't go in if you keep messing it up.

440
00:34:27,810 --> 00:34:30,170
That won't be good.

441
00:34:30,170 --> 00:34:33,360
Press it for me. 03...

442
00:34:35,790 --> 00:34:37,820
What if someone hears it?

443
00:34:38,500 --> 00:34:42,450
Then... lend me your ear.

444
00:34:42,450 --> 00:34:43,690
Pardon?

445
00:34:43,690 --> 00:34:45,410
Your ear.

446
00:35:13,170 --> 00:35:16,090
Can I leave when you fall asleep?

447
00:35:18,790 --> 00:35:20,720
Do you want to?

448
00:35:26,780 --> 00:35:28,560
Come on in.

449
00:36:05,500 --> 00:36:10,260
You saw through my lies, didn't you?

450
00:36:15,630 --> 00:36:19,940
I told you not to bring up first love.

451
00:36:19,940 --> 00:36:22,940
And I said I wanted to go back to the past.

452
00:36:25,200 --> 00:36:27,110
What else was there?

453
00:36:28,050 --> 00:36:31,470
You said there's no such thing as a highlight in life.

454
00:36:32,240 --> 00:36:35,510
And you said you got sick of teaching me.

455
00:36:36,310 --> 00:36:38,580
You should've forgotten about it.

456
00:36:39,940 --> 00:36:41,960
I forgot it now.

457
00:36:42,660 --> 00:36:44,460
Jun Ho.

458
00:36:52,220 --> 00:36:54,390
My head hurts.

459
00:38:46,460 --> 00:38:48,520
Good job, Lee Jun Ho.

460
00:38:49,220 --> 00:38:53,500
I wasn't an animal. I was a gentleman.

461
00:38:54,690 --> 00:38:58,610
Yes, good job.

462
00:38:58,610 --> 00:39:00,660
Good job.

463
00:39:20,680 --> 00:39:22,430
My head.

464
00:39:28,050 --> 00:39:31,600
Gosh. Well done, Seo Hye Jin.

465
00:39:33,270 --> 00:39:36,010
I have classes all day.

466
00:40:19,230 --> 00:40:20,830
You scared me.

467
00:40:27,300 --> 00:40:30,080
I didn't want to go through your stuff.

468
00:40:30,080 --> 00:40:32,360
So I picked up soup and medicine.

469
00:40:36,910 --> 00:40:39,620
You didn't forget what happened, right?

470
00:40:40,630 --> 00:40:42,890
Let me wash my face.

471
00:41:29,750 --> 00:41:31,410
 Teacher? 

472
00:41:40,670 --> 00:41:42,390
Are you okay?

473
00:42:12,430 --> 00:42:14,500
I'm sorry.

474
00:42:14,500 --> 00:42:18,250
- Last night, I—
 - I have a few announcements for you.

475
00:42:18,250 --> 00:42:19,910
Tell me.

476
00:42:19,910 --> 00:42:23,780
First of all, what can you eat?

477
00:42:24,890 --> 00:42:27,470
Even the water makes me sick.

478
00:42:28,300 --> 00:42:32,670
If so, I'll take over your morning and first afternoon class.

479
00:42:32,670 --> 00:42:34,710
What nonsense are you talking about? I've never—

480
00:42:34,710 --> 00:42:37,740
You'll feel better quickly if you get IV treatment and get some sleep.

481
00:42:37,740 --> 00:42:39,800
I'll explain things at work.

482
00:42:40,630 --> 00:42:44,110
No, they're my classes. I'll do it.

483
00:42:45,510 --> 00:42:50,110
I'll tell Team Leader Choi we were together last night.

484
00:42:50,110 --> 00:42:54,570
But I heard if she knows, the entire world knows.

485
00:42:57,210 --> 00:43:01,420
I found a hospital that opens on Sundays. Okay?

486
00:43:04,410 --> 00:43:07,270
What's the next announcement?

487
00:43:07,270 --> 00:43:09,330
We need to go somewhere after work today.

488
00:43:09,330 --> 00:43:10,880
Where?

489
00:43:10,880 --> 00:43:14,280
We need to go on a date. A historical one.

490
00:43:16,760 --> 00:43:20,580
D-Date? Date?

491
00:43:22,600 --> 00:43:24,420
First of all,

492
00:43:26,300 --> 00:43:28,500
I'll tell you where my class material is.

493
00:43:28,500 --> 00:43:31,810
My notebook should be on my desk at the academy.

494
00:43:33,050 --> 00:43:34,780
Hold on.

495
00:43:37,900 --> 00:43:40,940
There's another announcement left. It's the most important one.

496
00:43:40,940 --> 00:43:42,430
What is it?

497
00:43:48,720 --> 00:43:50,710
I completely...

498
00:43:52,160 --> 00:43:55,090
run out of patience now.

499
00:43:55,090 --> 00:43:56,430
What?

500
00:43:59,930 --> 00:44:01,630
Don't avoid it.

501
00:44:05,230 --> 00:44:08,080
♫  Days go by  ♫

502
00:44:09,410 --> 00:44:12,260
♫  Life is short  ♫

503
00:44:13,560 --> 00:44:20,850
♫  Something I know now even more  ♫

504
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:24,850
♫  But I'm still here  ♫

505
00:44:25,720 --> 00:44:29,050
♫  Like I've always been  ♫

506
00:44:30,010 --> 00:44:37,950
♫  Waiting for the time when I can hold you again  ♫

507
00:44:37,950 --> 00:44:46,810
♫  Wherever you are, you know I want to be  ♫

508
00:44:46,810 --> 00:44:50,880
♫  Together with you  ♫

509
00:44:50,880 --> 00:44:55,150
♫  Where I want to be, right by your side  ♫

510
00:44:55,150 --> 00:44:59,290
♫  Together with you  ♫

511
00:44:59,290 --> 00:45:03,580
♫  Where I want to be, right by your side  ♫

512
00:45:03,580 --> 00:45:07,800
♫  Together with you  ♫

513
00:45:07,800 --> 00:45:10,200
♫  For all of my life  ♫

514
00:45:10,200 --> 00:45:12,060
Hello.

515
00:45:14,270 --> 00:45:17,290
Hello. Hello.

516
00:45:23,660 --> 00:45:25,420
Let's see.

517
00:45:32,650 --> 00:45:34,090
Ms. Nam,

518
00:45:35,130 --> 00:45:39,330
if someone's filling in for your class,

519
00:45:39,330 --> 00:45:43,970
do you submit a report or just tell the assistant director?

520
00:45:45,730 --> 00:45:51,800
Ms. Seo is sick, so I will be teaching her early classes.

521
00:45:53,020 --> 00:45:57,320
Are you that happy that she's sick?

522
00:45:57,320 --> 00:45:59,060
Do I look happy?

523
00:46:00,270 --> 00:46:01,880
I'll fill in for her.

524
00:46:01,880 --> 00:46:04,170
No, I'll do it.

525
00:46:08,100 --> 00:46:10,120
Talk to me for a second.

526
00:46:16,820 --> 00:46:19,810
Team Leader can't report herself right now?

527
00:46:19,810 --> 00:46:24,790
No. She's probably getting IV treatment and sleeping now.

528
00:46:27,870 --> 00:46:31,390
- I'll report on her behalf.
 - No, I'll do it.

529
00:46:32,010 --> 00:46:34,730
How did you know she was sick?

530
00:46:35,530 --> 00:46:41,200
Telling people I found out first would be better for world peace.

531
00:46:43,530 --> 00:46:45,140
I knew you were the best.

532
00:46:45,140 --> 00:46:46,890
I'll fill in her classes, too.

533
00:46:46,890 --> 00:46:49,670
You really don't have to. I'll do it.

534
00:46:50,990 --> 00:46:53,060
Okay, let's do that, then.

535
00:46:53,060 --> 00:46:54,510
Okay.

536
00:46:57,800 --> 00:46:59,560
 Please don't take food into the classrooms 

537
00:46:59,560 --> 00:47:01,590
Gosh.

538
00:47:05,360 --> 00:47:08,620
Shouldn't you just be keeping her company?

539
00:47:14,200 --> 00:47:16,300
How do I return this favor?

540
00:47:16,300 --> 00:47:18,260
No, you don't have to.

541
00:47:18,260 --> 00:47:20,710
I've been paid in advance.

542
00:47:21,710 --> 00:47:24,930
The tablet. Team Leader would know.

543
00:47:24,930 --> 00:47:27,010
Paid in advance?

544
00:47:27,010 --> 00:47:29,150
What are you doing, Chae Yoon?

545
00:47:38,160 --> 00:47:40,040
- Hello.
 - Hello.

546
00:47:40,040 --> 00:47:42,970
Why are you two coming out of there?

547
00:47:42,970 --> 00:47:44,410
Well...

548
00:47:44,410 --> 00:47:48,570
Team Leader isn't feeling well. We discussed what we should do with her classes.

549
00:47:48,570 --> 00:47:50,620
Is she sick?

550
00:47:50,620 --> 00:47:54,320
Sounds like she has a bad flu.

551
00:47:54,320 --> 00:47:57,000
Oh, okay. Got it.

552
00:47:57,000 --> 00:47:59,020
 No Entry 

553
00:47:59,020 --> 00:48:01,140
Team Leader...

554
00:48:02,220 --> 00:48:05,430
Managing health is a skill, too.

555
00:48:08,300 --> 00:48:12,380
Would you be able to fill in all day?

556
00:48:12,380 --> 00:48:14,520
Of course.

557
00:48:14,520 --> 00:48:16,110
Tell her to take the whole day off.

558
00:48:16,110 --> 00:48:18,950
Tell her to recover completely before the special lectures.

559
00:48:18,950 --> 00:48:20,840
Okay, I will.

560
00:48:22,370 --> 00:48:24,120
By the way,

561
00:48:25,670 --> 00:48:28,250
looks like you're close to Team Leader Seo.

562
00:48:28,250 --> 00:48:31,390
I'm not close to anyone in particular.

563
00:48:33,590 --> 00:48:36,340
Don't half-ass it just because you're filling in.

564
00:48:36,340 --> 00:48:38,280
Only amateurs do that.

565
00:48:38,280 --> 00:48:40,800
Pros know how to take advantage of opportunities.

566
00:48:40,800 --> 00:48:45,260
The competition will be fierce during the break, you know?

567
00:48:45,260 --> 00:48:47,400
I understand.

568
00:48:47,400 --> 00:48:49,430
Tell Team Leader Lee to see me.

569
00:48:49,430 --> 00:48:50,850
Okay.

570
00:49:06,240 --> 00:49:11,520
 Team Leader Yun Ji Seok 

571
00:49:22,290 --> 00:49:25,010
You must be in a good mood.

572
00:49:25,010 --> 00:49:27,780
Yes. I'm just filling in,

573
00:49:27,780 --> 00:49:31,690
but teaching again makes me feel so excited.

574
00:49:31,690 --> 00:49:34,680
Teaching must be your calling.

575
00:49:34,680 --> 00:49:37,540
I get along with students.

576
00:49:37,540 --> 00:49:40,890
This neighborhood is different than the one you were in.

577
00:49:43,550 --> 00:49:48,340
Yes.  I'm not trying to say anything else.

578
00:49:48,340 --> 00:49:51,910
But I've worked at this academy longer.

579
00:49:51,910 --> 00:49:57,120
I think you should've discussed what happened today with me first

580
00:49:57,120 --> 00:49:59,630
instead of talking to Mr. Lee privately.

581
00:50:00,430 --> 00:50:05,220
Both you and Su Rim have classes all day today.

582
00:50:05,220 --> 00:50:08,710
Either Mr. Lee or I had to fill in, anyway.

583
00:50:08,710 --> 00:50:12,020
So we just wanted to figure it out on our own.

584
00:50:12,020 --> 00:50:14,240
Of course, I know that.

585
00:50:14,240 --> 00:50:16,770
You aren't offended, right?

586
00:50:16,770 --> 00:50:19,760
I'm saying I'm willing to help if I can.

587
00:50:19,760 --> 00:50:22,340
Although I'm younger than you.

588
00:50:41,490 --> 00:50:45,970
When did he leave? He even skipped breakfast.

589
00:50:45,970 --> 00:50:47,840
Gosh.

590
00:50:55,800 --> 00:50:57,870
He thinks he grew up on his own.

591
00:50:57,870 --> 00:51:03,070
Both his parents and teachers worked so hard to raise him.

592
00:51:03,940 --> 00:51:06,170
You can take it out in 30 minutes.

593
00:51:06,170 --> 00:51:08,910
- Okay. Thank you.
 - Sure.

594
00:51:35,500 --> 00:51:37,310
Team Leader, it's me.

595
00:51:37,310 --> 00:51:39,410
Why did you call so many times?

596
00:51:39,410 --> 00:51:41,580
How sick are you, exactly?

597
00:51:44,910 --> 00:51:47,000
How could I not worry

598
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:52,100
when someone who's never been late once has fallen ill?

599
00:51:52,100 --> 00:51:53,370
You're okay, right?

600
00:51:53,370 --> 00:51:55,200
I guess I'm getting old.

601
00:51:55,200 --> 00:51:57,880
I suddenly lost all my energy.

602
00:51:59,060 --> 00:52:01,400
Yes, I'm really okay.

603
00:52:03,350 --> 00:52:06,190
Shouldn't you be in class now?

604
00:52:06,190 --> 00:52:07,800
I'm sorry.

605
00:52:07,800 --> 00:52:09,870
Go back inside.

606
00:52:09,870 --> 00:52:11,960
Yes, see you on Tuesday.

607
00:52:11,960 --> 00:52:13,530
Bye.

608
00:52:19,500 --> 00:52:21,320
How are you feeling?

609
00:52:21,320 --> 00:52:23,460
Why are you here already?

610
00:52:23,460 --> 00:52:25,520
Did the classes get canceled? They can't be—

611
00:52:25,520 --> 00:52:26,910
No, no.

612
00:52:26,910 --> 00:52:28,690
Don't worry.

613
00:52:28,690 --> 00:52:32,080
Someone almost as trustworthy as me is filling in.

614
00:52:33,170 --> 00:52:37,150
 A Special Vacation Lecture 

615
00:52:37,150 --> 00:52:39,760
  Let's reach the SKY together! 

616
00:52:54,510 --> 00:52:56,750
I suddenly have too much time.

617
00:52:56,750 --> 00:52:59,550
I don't know what to do.

618
00:52:59,550 --> 00:53:01,430
Don't you know?

619
00:53:01,430 --> 00:53:03,700
Did you forget my announcement?

620
00:53:09,750 --> 00:53:11,970
 The door is closing. 

621
00:53:17,920 --> 00:53:20,290
♫  Open to page 64  ♫

622
00:53:20,290 --> 00:53:23,460
This is where the academy used to be. Why are we here?

623
00:53:23,460 --> 00:53:25,510
You'll see once you go inside.

624

♫  And you got the drive.  ♫

629
00:53:41,600 --> 00:53:44,530
They're demolishing everything tomorrow to start a new academy.

630
00:53:44,530 --> 00:53:47,220
That's why I wanted to come here with you today.

631
00:53:48,350 --> 00:53:53,790
It might not be cool, but isn't this the best first date spot?

632
00:53:53,790 --> 00:53:58,430
You couldn't say that if you knew why the old academy was shut down.

633
00:53:59,230 --> 00:54:03,720
Some teachers started dating, and things got disastrous.

634
00:54:03,720 --> 00:54:05,630
The academy had to shut its doors

635
00:54:05,630 --> 00:54:09,570
and the teachers can no longer teach in Daechi-dong.

636
00:54:09,570 --> 00:54:12,440
It's just a rumor I heard.

637
00:54:12,440 --> 00:54:16,980
It wouldn't have lasted if it shut down due to some love affair.

641
00:54:27,520 --> 00:54:29,000
It's not working.

642
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:30,240
It's okay.

643
00:54:30,240 --> 00:54:35,500
♫  Oh the greatness I foresee  ♫

644
00:54:37,120 --> 00:54:39,000
I realized too late that Seo Hye Jin,

645
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:43,230
who worked here, was just a college student.

646
00:54:43,230 --> 00:54:47,300
You acted like an adult because you were my teacher.

647
00:54:47,300 --> 00:54:51,720
And I was intimidated by that title for no reason. I realized that too late.

648
00:54:51,720 --> 00:54:53,620
It's so unfair.

649
00:54:56,360 --> 00:54:59,510
Whoa, I'm glad it's dark in here.

650
00:55:00,710 --> 00:55:05,360
I don't know what face to make whenever you say stuff like that.

651
00:55:05,360 --> 00:55:08,050
I don't want you to see me making a dumb face.

652
00:55:09,610 --> 00:55:15,520
♫  My heart's an open book, I profess  ♫

653
00:55:16,510 --> 00:55:18,460
You can tell me now.

654
00:55:20,100 --> 00:55:21,840
I...

655
00:55:22,900 --> 00:55:26,310
spent so much time with students,

656
00:55:26,310 --> 00:55:28,630
so I know the latest slang.

657
00:55:28,630 --> 00:55:35,130
But I don't know what women my age talk about,

658
00:55:35,130 --> 00:55:39,910
what they watch, listen to, or think about.

659
00:55:39,910 --> 00:55:42,390
So whenever you stay stuff like that,

660
00:55:42,390 --> 00:55:46,180
I think about what expression I'm supposed to make.

661
00:55:47,200 --> 00:55:49,610
You don't have to think in moments like this.

662
00:55:50,570 --> 00:55:52,250
You're right.

663
00:55:52,250 --> 00:55:56,910
I've been pretending to be an adult for a long time.

664
00:55:56,910 --> 00:56:02,390
But I can only put on that show in a classroom like this.

665
00:56:02,390 --> 00:56:05,550
I guess I'm kind of... how should I put it...

666
00:56:05,550 --> 00:56:07,670
slow and awkward with everything.

667
00:56:07,670 --> 00:56:09,820
What I'm trying to say is...

668
00:56:12,050 --> 00:56:15,300
that I'll still be goofing around a bit.

669
00:56:17,700 --> 00:56:19,740
I hope you can understand.

670
00:56:20,540 --> 00:56:22,300
I will.

671
00:56:32,480 --> 00:56:35,610
♫  So, open to page 64  ♫

672
00:56:35,610 --> 00:56:38,170
♫  We'll read about what's in store  ♫

673
00:56:38,170 --> 00:56:42,680
♫  Books are binding but there's so much more  ♫

674
00:56:42,680 --> 00:56:45,120
♫  These little school is mundane  ♫

675
00:56:45,120 --> 00:56:47,650
♫  But I can proudly proclaim  ♫

676
00:56:47,650 --> 00:56:51,890
♫  History will one day know your name  ♫

677
00:56:51,890 --> 00:56:54,330
This has to stay a secret.

678
00:56:54,330 --> 00:56:56,600
- Why?
 - Remember when we gave the free lecture?

679
00:56:56,600 --> 00:57:00,920
A lot of people are waiting for us to slip up.

680
00:57:02,420 --> 00:57:05,800
I can't create the schedule if people find out about us.

681
00:57:05,800 --> 00:57:07,250
If they're not happy about something,

682
00:57:07,250 --> 00:57:10,960
they'd say, "Seo Hye Jin went crazy since she seduced her young student."

683
00:57:10,960 --> 00:57:13,570
Tell them the young student seduced you first.

684
00:57:13,570 --> 00:57:16,930
Your recklessness would become my fault, too.

685
00:57:16,930 --> 00:57:19,380
They'd say you act out because I have your back.

686
00:57:19,380 --> 00:57:22,190
The problem is, all of that would become our reputation.

687
00:57:22,190 --> 00:57:24,210
Wouldn't that be bad?

688
00:57:28,770 --> 00:57:32,430
Don't get out. Just take the car with you.

689
00:57:33,230 --> 00:57:35,170
You want me to just leave?

690
00:57:36,100 --> 00:57:38,900
Well, we just had our historical first date.

691
00:57:38,900 --> 00:57:43,710
Shouldn't you offer me tea or ramyun at your place?

692
00:57:43,710 --> 00:57:45,110
Hey.

693
00:57:46,580 --> 00:57:49,640
- No, I can't do that.
 - Hold on. Stop.

694
00:57:57,750 --> 00:57:59,540
I need to study.

695
00:58:02,160 --> 00:58:04,230
Get home safely.

696
00:58:04,230 --> 00:58:05,640
Teach.

697
00:58:05,640 --> 00:58:07,010
Yes?

698
00:58:10,040 --> 00:58:12,000
This isn't good enough.

699
00:58:36,070 --> 00:58:38,990
Geez, I said we should make another trip.

700
00:58:39,810 --> 00:58:41,600
Can I come in with my shoes on?

701
00:58:41,600 --> 00:58:44,040
No, I just cleaned the floor. Hurry up.

702
00:58:44,040 --> 00:58:46,670
Stop pushing.

703
00:58:46,670 --> 00:58:48,480
Geez...

704
00:58:53,050 --> 00:58:54,900
Gosh, I'm tired.

705
00:58:56,990 --> 00:58:58,630
So cold.

706
00:58:58,630 --> 00:59:00,460
Where's the water?

707
00:59:00,460 --> 00:59:02,410
In the fridge.

708
00:59:10,780 --> 00:59:13,280
Gosh, I'm tired.

709
00:59:25,400 --> 00:59:29,040
Hey, you moved a lot of stuff already.

710
00:59:29,040 --> 00:59:31,450
I've been moving it little by little.

711
00:59:32,720 --> 00:59:34,320
Don't you use your father's car these days?

712
00:59:34,320 --> 00:59:37,840
No, I use Ms. Seo's car.

713
00:59:37,840 --> 00:59:39,610
Who?

714
00:59:39,610 --> 00:59:43,720
Seo Hye Jin. She lives nearby.

715
00:59:47,130 --> 00:59:48,680
What?

716
00:59:49,740 --> 00:59:52,680
What? Why are you looking at me like that?

717
00:59:52,680 --> 00:59:55,300
I thought everyone already knew.

718
00:59:55,300 --> 00:59:58,140
You liked her forever ago.

719
00:59:58,140 --> 01:00:00,280
I don't care how long ago it was.

720
01:00:00,280 --> 01:00:03,570
Your hunch is correct.

721
01:00:05,760 --> 01:00:07,790
You two are dating?

722
01:00:14,980 --> 01:00:18,690
Hey. I can't listen to this sober.

723
01:00:18,690 --> 01:00:20,070
Do you have a beer?

724
01:00:20,070 --> 01:00:21,520
I have a ton in the fridge.

725
01:00:21,520 --> 01:00:24,440
Feel free to finish it.

726
01:00:24,440 --> 01:00:26,500
- How about you?
 - I need to take a shower and go to work.

727
01:00:26,500 --> 01:00:27,910
It's the special lecture period.

728
01:00:27,910 --> 01:00:29,260
You bastard.

729
01:00:29,260 --> 01:00:31,590
I haven't had a day off for months.

730
01:00:31,590 --> 01:00:33,160
Seriously.

731
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:37,910
Where's the light switch?

732
01:00:50,690 --> 01:00:53,940
- Hey!
 - You scared me. What?

733
01:00:53,940 --> 01:00:55,850
What am I supposed to call her when I see her?

734
01:00:55,850 --> 01:00:58,670
Teacher? Sister-in-law?

735
01:00:59,350 --> 01:01:01,150
Or Hye Jin?

736
01:01:01,820 --> 01:01:03,530
It's sister-in-law, you bastard.

737
01:01:03,530 --> 01:01:06,160
"Hye Jin," my foot.

738
01:01:06,160 --> 01:01:07,860
Bastard.

739
01:01:16,190 --> 01:01:18,020
Hello, Ms. Seo.

740
01:01:18,020 --> 01:01:20,380
Wow, already?

741
01:01:20,380 --> 01:01:22,660
Can you tell that the semester is ending?

742
01:01:22,660 --> 01:01:26,020
You're right. It feels like the entrance exam ended yesterday.

743
01:01:26,020 --> 01:01:28,950
Go to the director's office. He wants to see you.

744
01:01:28,950 --> 01:01:31,000
I'll be done quickly. Let's decorate this together.

745
01:01:31,000 --> 01:01:32,770
It's my favorite thing to do.

746
01:01:32,770 --> 01:01:34,540
I'd love to.

747
01:01:35,760 --> 01:01:38,660
Hello. Hi.

748
01:01:40,100 --> 01:01:41,860
Hello.

749
01:01:41,860 --> 01:01:45,010
Wow, I'm getting a year older already.

750
01:01:45,010 --> 01:01:47,900
Do you want to decorate it together, Mr. Jang?

751
01:01:47,900 --> 01:01:49,300
I'm a Buddhist.

752
01:01:49,300 --> 01:01:50,960
I see.

753
01:01:52,900 --> 01:01:54,850
I'll join you.

754
01:01:54,850 --> 01:01:57,010
Gosh, thank you.

755
01:02:03,370 --> 01:02:05,010
Yes.

756
01:02:06,200 --> 01:02:09,170
- I heard you wanted to see me.
 - Hey.

757
01:02:09,170 --> 01:02:11,920
Because of the emergency supplementary class,

758
01:02:11,920 --> 01:02:14,890
I don't get to see the teachers and team leaders.

759
01:02:14,890 --> 01:02:17,120
I just wanted to catch up with you.

760
01:02:17,120 --> 01:02:18,750
Have a seat.

761
01:02:28,520 --> 01:02:31,640
Do I look that weird? Why can't you look at me?

762
01:02:32,440 --> 01:02:34,060
It's not like that.

763
01:02:34,060 --> 01:02:36,180
Okay, then. Look at me.

764
01:02:36,180 --> 01:02:37,640
Look at me.

765
01:02:37,640 --> 01:02:39,430
It's okay.

766
01:02:40,300 --> 01:02:43,490
My mother heard something somewhere.

767
01:02:43,490 --> 01:02:46,650
She said it'd make the academy grow bigger

768
01:02:46,650 --> 01:02:50,380
and I'd stop being a bachelor, too.

769
01:02:50,380 --> 01:02:52,750
I hope it works.

770
01:02:53,650 --> 01:02:55,230
I heard he's good. Do you want their number?

771
01:02:55,230 --> 01:02:57,350
No, I'm okay.

772
01:02:59,770 --> 01:03:05,540
Aren't you curious if you'll make someone the top of the class again?

773
01:03:06,650 --> 01:03:09,760
Looks like you're more curious about that.

774
01:03:10,830 --> 01:03:12,970
Aren't you curious about it?

775
01:03:12,970 --> 01:03:16,660
I was curious whenever there were exams,

776
01:03:16,660 --> 01:03:18,050
but not this time.

777
01:03:18,050 --> 01:03:20,030
Why not?

778
01:03:20,030 --> 01:03:22,260
Everyone will do well.

779
01:03:22,260 --> 01:03:25,110
I did everything I could.

780
01:03:27,970 --> 01:03:32,190
Chanyeong and Huiwon High happened to have Korean exams on the same day.

781
01:03:32,190 --> 01:03:35,170
You'll get the results all at once.

782
01:03:39,550 --> 01:03:41,120
You're right.

783
01:03:45,280 --> 01:03:47,680
What did you think? Did you enjoy the class?

784
01:03:47,680 --> 01:03:49,920
 - Yes. 
 - Good.

785
01:03:49,920 --> 01:03:54,420
I'll nag you for the hundredth time and let you go.

786
01:03:54,420 --> 01:03:56,730
The short-answer questions and essay questions

787
01:03:56,730 --> 01:03:59,260
aren't simply important because they're worth a lot of points.

788
01:03:59,260 --> 01:04:03,540
The ability to summarize your thoughts and knowledge within a limited time

789
01:04:03,540 --> 01:04:06,820
will be an asset for your lifetime.

790
01:04:06,820 --> 01:04:11,810
I'm not telling you to become amazing writers like the poets Baek Seok, Kim Chun Su,

791
01:04:11,810 --> 01:04:14,900
or the novelist Kim Ae Ran you learned about today.

792
01:04:14,900 --> 01:04:19,940
I think you are acquiring the basic knowledge you need to complete high school.

793
01:04:19,940 --> 01:04:22,910
Review those materials until the end, okay?

794
01:04:22,910 --> 01:04:24,230
 Okay. 

795
01:04:24,230 --> 01:04:25,860
Well done, everyone.

796
01:04:25,860 --> 01:04:30,200
If you've kept up with my class, you can be confident about tomorrow's exam.

797
01:04:30,200 --> 01:04:32,320
I'm confident.

798
01:04:32,320 --> 01:04:34,250
This is your moment now.

799
01:04:37,580 --> 01:04:39,120
Go home.

800
01:04:39,120 --> 01:04:41,330
Thank you.

801
01:04:44,190 --> 01:04:47,720
Good job. Good job. Good job.

802
01:04:47,720 --> 01:04:49,810
Bye. Take care.

803
01:04:49,810 --> 01:04:52,140
Well done.

804
01:04:52,140 --> 01:04:54,830
- Well done.
 - Good luck. Good luck. Fighting.

805
01:04:54,830 --> 01:04:57,260
Well done.

806
01:04:59,600 --> 01:05:00,650
Well done.

807
01:05:00,650 --> 01:05:02,880
Well done, Lee Si Wu.

808
01:05:04,200 --> 01:05:08,920
Ms. Seo, is there a class next week, by chance?

809
01:05:08,920 --> 01:05:10,470
Why do you ask?

810
01:05:13,310 --> 01:05:15,240
Can you give a literature lecture?

811
01:05:15,240 --> 01:05:17,510
Just like the old free lecture.

812
01:05:17,510 --> 01:05:23,120
Hey, everyone would hate us if we had a class right after the exam.

813
01:05:23,120 --> 01:05:25,520
I think it'd be fun.

814
01:05:25,520 --> 01:05:28,180
I'll have to if you think it'd be fun.

815
01:05:30,190 --> 01:05:31,720
Okay.

816
01:05:32,400 --> 01:05:34,000
Thank you.

817
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:35,580
- You've worked hard.
 - See you.

818
01:05:35,580 --> 01:05:38,260
- Fighting.
 - Bye.

819
01:05:52,640 --> 01:05:54,620
Well done, Mr. Lee.

820
01:05:54,620 --> 01:05:57,420
You've worked hard, Ms. Seo.

821
01:06:00,530 --> 01:06:02,690
It's finally over.

822
01:06:02,690 --> 01:06:04,490
Well done.

823
01:06:05,270 --> 01:06:07,630
We need to run away before anyone suggests celebrating.

824
01:06:07,630 --> 01:06:09,240
Wait for me at the subway station.

825
01:06:09,240 --> 01:06:11,870
People might see us in the parking lot.

826
01:06:21,020 --> 01:06:23,700
♫  Days go by  ♫

827
01:06:25,160 --> 01:06:28,220
♫  Life is short  ♫

828
01:06:29,310 --> 01:06:36,640
♫  It's something I know now, even more  ♫

829
01:06:37,730 --> 01:06:40,650
♫  But I'm still here  ♫

830
01:06:41,530 --> 01:06:44,720
♫  like I've always been  ♫

831
01:06:45,780 --> 01:06:53,680
♫  Waiting for the time when I can hold you again  ♫

832
01:06:53,680 --> 01:07:02,620
♫  Wherever you are I know I want to be  ♫

833
01:07:02,620 --> 01:07:07,070
♫  Together with you  ♫

834
01:07:07,070 --> 01:07:09,760
I wanted to catch a late-night screening.

835
01:07:09,760 --> 01:07:11,410
The exam is tomorrow.

836
01:07:11,410 --> 01:07:14,380
We might hear from them.

837
01:07:14,380 --> 01:07:16,760
Let's catch the movie next time.

838
01:07:16,760 --> 01:07:18,200
All right.

839
01:07:23,970 --> 01:07:26,020
♫  My heart is yours  ♫

840
01:07:26,020 --> 01:07:28,270
Seriously.

841
01:07:28,270 --> 01:07:31,300
♫  I feel it pound  ♫

842
01:07:32,390 --> 01:07:39,690
♫  I still see your sparks whenever you're around  ♫

843
01:07:40,830 --> 01:07:43,900
♫  Each passing day,  ♫

844
01:07:45,080 --> 01:07:47,860
♫  that you're not here  ♫

845
01:07:47,860 --> 01:07:52,170
Oh, I ran out of milk. I forgot.

846
01:07:53,680 --> 01:07:56,750
♫  You are near  ♫

847
01:07:56,750 --> 01:08:01,000
♫  But wherever you are  ♫

848
01:08:01,000 --> 01:08:05,120
♫  and no matter how far  ♫

849
01:08:05,120 --> 01:08:09,940
♫  I always want to be  ♫

850
01:08:09,940 --> 01:08:13,610
♫  Together with you  ♫

851
01:08:13,610 --> 01:08:15,020
Do you want a bag?

852
01:08:15,020 --> 01:08:17,340
The bag is 100 won.

853
01:08:18,420 --> 01:08:22,610
♫  Together with you  ♫

854
01:08:22,610 --> 01:08:26,820
♫  For all of my life  ♫

855
01:08:26,820 --> 01:08:29,460
 Do you need a receipt? 

856
01:08:29,460 --> 01:08:31,000
Ma'am?

857
01:08:32,350 --> 01:08:35,110
- Yes. 
- The payment went through.

858
01:08:41,380 --> 01:08:43,520
Go home.

859
01:08:43,520 --> 01:08:44,840
I'll walk you home.

860
01:08:44,840 --> 01:08:47,670
It's just around the corner.

861
01:08:52,370 --> 01:08:59,880
♫  Or is it just another dream where you told me  ♫

862
01:08:59,880 --> 01:09:03,110
♫  I love you,  ♫

863
01:09:03,110 --> 01:09:07,230
♫  What I would not do  ♫

864
01:09:07,230 --> 01:09:17,320
♫  If could make it come true  ♫

865
01:09:17,320 --> 01:09:21,330
♫  Together with you  ♫

866
01:09:21,330 --> 01:09:25,740
♫  Where I want to be, right by your side  ♫

867
01:09:25,740 --> 01:09:29,830
♫  Together with you  ♫

868
01:09:29,830 --> 01:09:34,110
♫  Where I'll always be, right by your side  ♫

869
01:09:34,110 --> 01:09:38,700
♫  Together with you  ♫

870
01:09:38,700 --> 01:09:41,110
Change the entrance passcode.

871
01:09:42,780 --> 01:09:44,700
I feel like...

872
01:09:46,640 --> 01:09:48,220
I shouldn't know it.

873
01:09:48,220 --> 01:09:50,260
Oh, I changed it.

874
01:09:51,010 --> 01:09:52,660
I see.

875
01:09:59,400 --> 01:10:01,270
Go inside now.

876
01:10:04,130 --> 01:10:05,540
Lend me your ear.

877
01:10:05,540 --> 01:10:07,900
Huh? What?

878
01:10:09,510 --> 01:10:11,660
That was a lie.

879
01:10:12,340 --> 01:10:15,260
Change it as soon as you get home.

880
01:10:15,260 --> 01:10:18,040
I actually had milk at home.

881
01:10:20,870 --> 01:10:22,850
Didn't I seem really smooth?

882
01:10:23,660 --> 01:10:25,350
Let's go up.

883
01:10:30,250 --> 01:10:32,110
Let's go up, I said.

884
01:10:35,960 --> 01:10:45,020


885
01:10:50,010 --> 01:10:52,720
♫  Steady as she goes  ♫

886
01:10:52,720 --> 01:10:56,490
♫  It seems like everybody knows  ♫

887
01:10:56,490 --> 01:11:01,210
 The Midnight Romance in Hagwon 

888
01:11:01,210 --> 01:11:03,110
 See you at the academy. 

889
01:11:05,850 --> 01:11:07,830
 Why are you coming from here? 

890
01:11:07,830 --> 01:11:10,390
 Come out later. Take the elevator when you come up. 

891
01:11:10,390 --> 01:11:12,280
 I'm asking what the academy wants from me. 

892
01:11:12,280 --> 01:11:14,200
 I didn't even think about opening the contract. 

893
01:11:14,200 --> 01:11:17,120
 You get assessed by the grades, not words. 

894
01:11:17,120 --> 01:11:18,950
 Yesterday, this bastard... 

895
01:11:18,950 --> 01:11:21,580
 Give me the passcode for the apartment in return. 

896
01:11:21,580 --> 01:11:23,280
 - Hello, Ms. Seo. 
- Oh, hey. 

897
01:11:23,280 --> 01:11:25,770
 I thought I'd lose my title as your favorite student. 

898
01:11:25,770 --> 01:11:30,010
 Does it not matter? Because I'm your boyfriend, not your student anymore?
