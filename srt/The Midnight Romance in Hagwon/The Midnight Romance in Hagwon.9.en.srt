(The Midnight Romance in Hagwon)

6
00:00:47,679 --> 00:00:48,749
You should get inside.

7
00:00:52,450 --> 00:00:54,219
- Come closer. - What?

8
00:00:57,889 --> 00:00:58,889
That was a lie.

9
00:01:00,660 --> 00:01:02,200
Then you should change it as soon as...

10
00:01:03,560 --> 00:01:05,429
Actually, I had milk at home.

11
00:01:09,300 --> 00:01:10,500
That was pretty smooth. Wasn't it?

12
00:01:11,910 --> 00:01:12,910
Let's go upstairs.

13
00:01:19,410 --> 00:01:20,449
Let's go up.

14
00:01:21,449 --> 00:01:23,379
Wait. Do you want to watch a late-night movie instead? Then...

15
00:01:23,380 --> 00:01:26,020
Gosh, no. Of course, we should go upstairs.

00:01:34,030 --> 00:01:36,559
(Episode 9)

17
00:01:52,479 --> 00:01:53,479
Answer it.

18
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:55,080
Gosh, no.

19
00:01:56,649 --> 00:01:58,789
I told you. Some students call us before the exam.

20
00:02:03,819 --> 00:02:05,890
Gosh, I don't have to answer this. It's Seoung Gyu.

21
00:02:09,330 --> 00:02:10,399
Excuse me for a second.

22
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,029
Hey, what is it?

23
00:02:14,030 --> 00:02:16,199
Hey. You'll be home soon. Right?

24
00:02:17,199 --> 00:02:19,739
I'm going to order fried chicken. Come and pay for it.

25
00:02:20,009 --> 00:02:23,039
Okay. Sure. Go ahead. Order it.

26
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:29,120
What is it?

27
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:31,120
Is something wrong with Seoung Gyu?

28
00:02:31,850 --> 00:02:33,649
No. Well,

29
00:02:33,650 --> 00:02:36,488
Seoung Gyu helped me move into my new place today.

30
00:02:36,489 --> 00:02:38,660
- He's still at my house. - Okay.

31
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:42,030
Let me go and feed him. I need 30 minutes. No.

32
00:02:43,130 --> 00:02:45,729
I mean, I'll come back as fast as I can.

33
00:02:46,169 --> 00:02:47,430
- As fast as you can? - Yes.

34
00:02:48,239 --> 00:02:50,340
I'll come back in a jiffy.

35
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:52,069
So could you wait for me?

36
00:02:53,069 --> 00:02:55,340
- Gosh. Thank you. - We must've made you wait long.

37
00:02:57,509 --> 00:02:59,210
- Gosh. Come on. - Oh, no.

38
00:03:01,350 --> 00:03:02,720
What am I going to do?

39
00:03:05,889 --> 00:03:06,889
I'm sorry.

40
00:03:08,889 --> 00:03:11,530
- Thank you. I appreciate it. - Bye.

41
00:03:11,859 --> 00:03:12,889
Honey!

42
00:03:15,299 --> 00:03:16,530
This too.

43
00:03:19,229 --> 00:03:20,229
It's fine.

44
00:03:25,739 --> 00:03:27,239
- Anyway, - Yes.

45
00:03:27,340 --> 00:03:28,380
wait for me.

46
00:03:30,180 --> 00:03:31,250
Don't fall asleep.

47
00:03:33,250 --> 00:03:34,650
- Promise me. - Okay.

48
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:36,750
- I'll be back soon. - Okay.

49
00:03:48,699 --> 00:03:49,699
Gosh.

50
00:04:57,400 --> 00:04:58,429
Right.

51
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:56,320
Hey. You're home early.

52
00:06:56,580 --> 00:06:57,580
Yes.

53
00:06:58,950 --> 00:07:01,020
What do you think? I did a great job cleaning the house, didn't I?

54
00:07:01,859 --> 00:07:04,660
Yes. Hey, thank you. It's so spotless I got goosebumps.

55
00:07:05,030 --> 00:07:06,030
Here.

56
00:07:21,169 --> 00:07:22,439
Let's see.

57
00:07:29,320 --> 00:07:31,390
- What are you doing? - What?

58
00:07:31,989 --> 00:07:33,619
Well, you worked hard to clean the house today.

59
00:07:34,119 --> 00:07:35,119
You should drink some nice liquor.

60
00:07:35,689 --> 00:07:37,590
Why did you just sit down like that?

61
00:07:38,289 --> 00:07:39,289
What do you mean?

62
00:07:40,789 --> 00:07:42,159
You've been outside.

63
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:43,660
Wash your hands and change your clothes first.

64
00:07:46,299 --> 00:07:47,400
I was about to get changed.

65
00:09:29,100 --> 00:09:30,139
This is good.

66
00:09:31,810 --> 00:09:34,040
Hey. Should we invite Ho Jae?

67
00:09:34,639 --> 00:09:35,680
Why?

68
00:09:37,009 --> 00:09:38,450
He said he had a company dinner today.

69
00:09:39,210 --> 00:09:40,409
Let's invite him for the second round.

70
00:09:40,779 --> 00:09:42,319
Gosh, what are you talking about?

71
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:44,279
He has work tomorrow morning. Why would we invite him here?

72
00:09:45,889 --> 00:09:46,920
Let's just drink by ourselves.

73
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:48,590
All right. Here.

74
00:10:32,129 --> 00:10:33,129
This is so good.

75
00:10:40,670 --> 00:10:41,739
You know what?

76
00:10:43,540 --> 00:10:44,580
Invite Seo Hye Jin over.

77
00:10:45,450 --> 00:10:46,779
You said she lived nearby.

78
00:10:47,649 --> 00:10:48,719
Gosh, what's up with you, jerk?

79
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:50,879
Why do you want to invite people whenever you drink? Seriously.

80
00:10:52,519 --> 00:10:55,320
You know, when I was mopping the floor all day,

81
00:10:55,759 --> 00:10:57,859
I solved a very important puzzle.

82
00:10:59,029 --> 00:11:00,060
How should I put it?

83
00:11:00,629 --> 00:11:03,129
As a scholar of history, I would say it was a major discovery.

84
00:11:03,229 --> 00:11:04,299
- Yes. What is it? - You know?

85
00:11:04,300 --> 00:11:06,670
- I wanted to tell you about that. - I see. Gosh.

86
00:11:07,170 --> 00:11:09,639
That sounds incredibly boring. Seriously.

87
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:11,810
It's about you.

88
00:11:12,470 --> 00:11:13,470
What?

89
00:11:16,279 --> 00:11:19,979
Over the years, I've met your ex-girlfriends several times.

90
00:11:21,879 --> 00:11:22,919
So what?

91
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:23,978
You want me to invite my current girlfriend,

92
00:11:23,979 --> 00:11:25,519
so you can tell her about my dating history?

93
00:11:26,450 --> 00:11:28,720
- What are you, a lunatic? - Come on. Just hear me out.

94
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:33,460
Strangely, I couldn't figure out your type.

95
00:11:34,430 --> 00:11:35,830
From my observation,

96
00:11:36,129 --> 00:11:38,868
your ex-girlfriends didn't have anything in common. You know?

97
00:11:38,869 --> 00:11:40,129
That's how I felt.

98
00:11:40,930 --> 00:11:42,940
If I must find something in common with all of your past relationships,

99
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:45,470
you dated them only briefly.

100
00:11:46,909 --> 00:11:47,909
So what?

101
00:11:49,609 --> 00:11:50,739
But they did have it.

102
00:11:51,479 --> 00:11:53,009
All of them had this critical feature in common.

103
00:11:54,879 --> 00:11:55,879
What was it?

104
00:11:57,050 --> 00:11:58,320
- Are you curious? - Come on.

105
00:11:59,420 --> 00:12:00,920
Yes. Tell me.

106
00:12:04,190 --> 00:12:07,259
Drumroll, please.

107
00:12:09,359 --> 00:12:10,430
The dimples.

108
00:12:11,529 --> 00:12:15,670
All of your ex-girlfriends had dimples.

109
00:12:18,639 --> 00:12:21,369
Right? That's Seo Hye Jin's trademark feature.

110
00:12:23,509 --> 00:12:26,009
Gosh. You haven't changed, have you?

111
00:12:29,279 --> 00:12:30,350
Don't wait for me. Go to sleep.

112
00:12:31,649 --> 00:12:32,690
What?

113
00:12:33,220 --> 00:12:34,349
Hey, where are you going?

114
00:12:34,350 --> 00:12:35,690
Come on. You know where.

115
00:12:35,759 --> 00:12:37,190
Invite Ho Jae or do whatever you want.

116
00:12:39,460 --> 00:12:40,489
By the way,

117
00:12:40,659 --> 00:12:42,028
if you don't use a proper title to call her next time,

118
00:12:42,029 --> 00:12:44,060
I swear. I'm going to kill you.

119
00:12:45,070 --> 00:12:46,100
Seriously.

120
00:13:06,290 --> 00:13:07,350
I'm on my way now.

121
00:14:18,830 --> 00:14:20,330
I'll cut you some slack tonight.

122
00:14:45,820 --> 00:14:46,850
Come on in.

123
00:14:47,249 --> 00:14:48,590
- Gosh. - Goodness.

124
00:14:52,960 --> 00:14:55,129
You're sweating. Aren't you cold?

125
00:14:56,560 --> 00:14:57,600
I think I just ran 100m...

126
00:14:58,129 --> 00:14:59,300
in eight seconds.

127
00:14:59,869 --> 00:15:01,200
I should be a gold medalist.

128
00:15:05,609 --> 00:15:06,739
Seriously.

129
00:15:11,379 --> 00:15:12,649
Oh, no.

130
00:15:25,229 --> 00:15:26,330
I'm coming in.

131
00:16:13,739 --> 00:16:14,769
Wait.

132
00:16:16,509 --> 00:16:18,649
The light... Let's turn that off.

133
00:16:29,119 --> 00:16:30,159
Ms. Seo.

134
00:16:31,019 --> 00:16:32,460
I want to see your face.

135
00:16:34,989 --> 00:16:35,999
Wait.

136
00:16:38,129 --> 00:16:39,829
- I... - I won't turn on the light.

137
00:16:39,830 --> 00:16:40,869
Okay.

138
00:16:41,570 --> 00:16:42,570
All right.

139
00:16:43,739 --> 00:16:44,769
Can I...

140
00:16:50,639 --> 00:16:53,080
- Ms. Seo. I... - Could you move?

141
00:16:56,550 --> 00:16:57,580
Oh, no.

142
00:16:58,690 --> 00:17:00,149
Goodness. Are you hurt?

143
00:17:00,690 --> 00:17:01,690
Are you okay?

144
00:17:02,659 --> 00:17:04,059
What did you land on first?

145
00:17:04,060 --> 00:17:06,060
Oh, no. You didn't fall on your head first, right?

146
00:17:07,659 --> 00:17:11,199
Well, could you explain to me what's going on first?

147
00:17:11,359 --> 00:17:12,469
Oh, no.

148
00:17:12,669 --> 00:17:14,800
- Did you have a change of heart? - No, that's not it.

149
00:17:19,540 --> 00:17:20,968
Are you that dense?

150
00:17:20,969 --> 00:17:22,980
- What? - Gosh. I...

151
00:17:23,879 --> 00:17:26,408
I don't know how much more I need to teach you.

152
00:17:26,409 --> 00:17:28,750
- Wait. Ms. Seo. What... - Hey, that!

153
00:17:29,679 --> 00:17:31,820
- Don't do that. - Ms. Seo.

154
00:17:31,990 --> 00:17:34,350
Don't call me like I'm still your teacher.

155
00:17:35,149 --> 00:17:37,219
Gosh. When I hear you say that,

156
00:17:38,060 --> 00:17:40,159
I feel like I'm doing something wrong to you.

157
00:17:47,629 --> 00:17:48,639
Let me see.

158
00:17:49,240 --> 00:17:50,600
What did you land on first?

159
00:17:51,439 --> 00:17:52,469
Gosh, seriously.

160
00:17:54,139 --> 00:17:55,579
We got really lucky.

161
00:17:55,580 --> 00:17:57,139
If I fell forward like this,

162
00:17:57,540 --> 00:17:59,209
you would have lived alone for the rest of your life.

163
00:18:01,919 --> 00:18:02,949
That's your fault, though.

164
00:18:05,750 --> 00:18:06,850
Okay.

165
00:18:08,590 --> 00:18:09,919
Then teach me properly.

166
00:18:21,030 --> 00:18:22,070
I thought you were...

167
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:23,469
I have to confess something.

168
00:18:40,990 --> 00:18:42,090
I can't see your face now.

169
00:18:42,590 --> 00:18:43,689
Go ahead. Confess.

170
00:18:46,459 --> 00:18:47,459
I...

171
00:18:51,399 --> 00:18:52,429
I...

172
00:18:56,540 --> 00:18:58,070
I can't teach this.

173
00:19:01,810 --> 00:19:02,840
What?

174
00:19:04,409 --> 00:19:05,679
You knew that, didn't you?

175
00:19:07,250 --> 00:19:10,020
Gosh, no. I thought you were a total pro.

176
00:19:16,419 --> 00:19:17,459
What else?

177
00:19:18,459 --> 00:19:19,959
Is there anything else I should know?

178
00:19:21,389 --> 00:19:22,560
I don't think so.

179
00:19:24,500 --> 00:19:26,070
Then, I'll tell you something this time.

180
00:19:30,639 --> 00:19:31,740
Seo Hye Jin,

181
00:19:33,709 --> 00:19:34,740
I love you.

182
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:44,480
For much longer than I thought,

183
00:19:46,590 --> 00:19:47,790
I've loved you.

184
00:19:53,129 --> 00:19:54,490
Should I say it one more time?

185
00:19:56,159 --> 00:19:57,199
Seo Hye Jin...

186
00:20:03,469 --> 00:20:04,540
You don't have to say it.

187
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:08,909
I can feel it...

188
00:20:11,040 --> 00:20:12,149
more than enough.

189
00:21:41,369 --> 00:21:42,570
You can sleep more.

190
00:21:42,800 --> 00:21:44,300
You have to go, don't you?

191
00:21:44,639 --> 00:21:45,709
Yes.

192
00:21:46,570 --> 00:21:49,480
Gosh, Seoung Gyu. I should've just stopped being friends with him.

193
00:22:07,959 --> 00:22:10,259
- I'll go to work separately. - Okay.

194
00:22:10,260 --> 00:22:13,070
I think I should at least feed that punk Seoung Gyu breakfast.

195
00:22:15,699 --> 00:22:18,369
Go home and get some more sleep. You have time in the morning.

196
00:22:23,580 --> 00:22:24,740
Since I have more time...

197
00:22:31,350 --> 00:22:33,449
Oh, my! Where are you going?

198
00:23:22,270 --> 00:23:23,439
Excuse me.

199
00:23:23,740 --> 00:23:25,369
Are you perhaps Mr. Pyo Sang Seob?

200
00:23:28,169 --> 00:23:29,980
Yes, I am.

201
00:23:35,149 --> 00:23:36,179
Here.

202
00:23:41,090 --> 00:23:43,119
Why have you come to see me?

203
00:23:44,020 --> 00:23:46,659
It seemed you didn't answer calls from numbers you don't know.

204
00:23:47,060 --> 00:23:49,060
I mean, what does an academy want to do with me?

205
00:23:51,359 --> 00:23:52,899
Could I perhaps escort you to my car?

206
00:23:53,330 --> 00:23:54,929
I will explain to you on the way.

207
00:23:59,270 --> 00:24:01,969
Well, it won't be something that makes you uncomfortable.

208
00:24:06,209 --> 00:24:07,250
I'll see you at the academy.

209
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:09,719
Don't be late.

210
00:24:11,219 --> 00:24:12,320
In case you miss me until then?

211
00:24:12,949 --> 00:24:14,388
- Kids get their grades today. - Gosh.

212
00:24:14,389 --> 00:24:15,389
Aren't you nervous?

213
00:24:17,320 --> 00:24:19,629
Not really. I taught them perfectly.

214
00:24:19,730 --> 00:24:21,159
I even held myself back from wanting to hug someone.

215
00:24:25,030 --> 00:24:26,070
- Hello. - Hello.

216
00:24:29,639 --> 00:24:30,899
The doors are closing.

217
00:25:35,030 --> 00:25:36,300
Good morning, friends.

218
00:25:36,399 --> 00:25:38,270
Finally, the day of the Korean exam is upon us.

219
00:25:38,869 --> 00:25:41,239
Don't get nervous and think of today as the day...

220
00:25:41,240 --> 00:25:42,939
where you'll be repaid for your effort until now.

221
00:25:42,980 --> 00:25:44,209
Let's keep up your energy just a little longer.

222
00:25:44,639 --> 00:25:46,250
For questions you know, don't make mistakes.

223
00:25:46,649 --> 00:25:49,350
For confusing questions, get through it with the energy of the universe.

224
00:25:49,649 --> 00:25:51,850
Let's go! Our whole class will get perfect scores!

225
00:25:52,389 --> 00:25:53,389
You can do it!

226
00:25:53,719 --> 00:25:54,949
What's with these emoticons?

227
00:25:55,619 --> 00:25:56,790
Is this really Ms. Seo?

228
00:25:58,320 --> 00:25:59,859
Hey, do you think Ms. Seo has been hacked?

229
00:26:00,560 --> 00:26:02,129
She sounds like a totally different person.

230
00:26:05,330 --> 00:26:06,330
No way.

231
00:26:08,129 --> 00:26:10,939
Ms. Seo seems to be in a good mood lately, doesn't she?

232
00:26:11,300 --> 00:26:12,409
I'm sure she is happy.

233
00:26:12,570 --> 00:26:14,709
They'll get some free time too once our exams are over.

234
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:17,439
What do you think today's questions will be like?

235
00:26:18,409 --> 00:26:19,608
I'm so scared.

236
00:26:19,609 --> 00:26:21,109
I'm totally confident.

237
00:26:21,209 --> 00:26:23,750
Ms. Seo even summarized Sang Seob's breathing sounds for us.

238
00:26:25,649 --> 00:26:28,419
There are too many eyes watching in Daechi-dong.

239
00:26:28,590 --> 00:26:30,189
Also, it's during exam season.

240
00:26:31,490 --> 00:26:33,459
First, our director, Ms. Choi told me to tell you...

241
00:26:33,590 --> 00:26:36,500
that she wanted to apologize for meeting you like this...

242
00:26:36,859 --> 00:26:38,030
under these conditions.

243
00:26:43,939 --> 00:26:46,869
If you look next to you, you'll see an envelope.

244
00:26:48,310 --> 00:26:50,840
It's a contract with Choisun Academy.

245
00:26:51,909 --> 00:26:54,780
The director's business card is also inside.

246
00:26:55,250 --> 00:26:56,619
Please take a look and give us a call.

247
00:27:00,020 --> 00:27:03,359
Please stop the car at any subway station you see next.

248
00:27:44,730 --> 00:27:45,760
Yes, Ms. Choi.

249
00:27:46,869 --> 00:27:48,270
Yes, I met with him.

250
00:27:50,070 --> 00:27:52,770
He left the contract as is and got out of the car in the middle,

251
00:27:53,010 --> 00:27:54,139
just as you predicted.

252
00:27:57,310 --> 00:27:59,679
Yes, then I will head to your house right away.

253
00:28:00,179 --> 00:28:02,879
(Exit 1, Junggye 3-dong, Exit 6, Nowon Community Hall)

254
00:28:54,600 --> 00:28:56,340
- You are ready for it, right? - Oh, gosh.

255
00:28:57,240 --> 00:28:58,969
Let's call it even after you tell me the passcode to your house.

256
00:29:00,010 --> 00:29:01,270
"Call it even?" You punk.

257
00:29:01,770 --> 00:29:03,510
Gosh, don't worry.

258
00:29:03,909 --> 00:29:05,280
It's not like I'll come every day.

259
00:29:06,209 --> 00:29:07,609
I'll only come on days when school gets out late.

260
00:29:08,250 --> 00:29:09,250
Get lost.

261
00:29:11,219 --> 00:29:12,219
Okay.

262
00:29:27,399 --> 00:29:30,369
Hi, Mom. Have you gone to work?

263
00:29:32,369 --> 00:29:34,340
Oh, yes. Jun Ho's move went well.

264
00:29:35,980 --> 00:29:37,780
But yesterday, this punk...

265
00:29:37,939 --> 00:29:39,010
Zero, three, two, seven.

266
00:29:39,649 --> 00:29:42,350
- Zero, three, two, seven. - Gosh, he must've been tired.

267
00:29:42,780 --> 00:29:44,379
He passed out as soon as he got home.

268
00:29:44,850 --> 00:29:46,520
I'm sure he is tired.

269
00:29:46,820 --> 00:29:49,320
The makeup classes for finals just ended yesterday.

270
00:29:51,820 --> 00:29:52,928
Yes, okay.

271
00:29:52,929 --> 00:29:55,859
Hey, Seoung Gyu. You should eat something expensive.

272
00:29:56,060 --> 00:29:58,659
If he asked my precious son to do hard labor,

273
00:29:58,899 --> 00:30:00,230
he should at least buy you a good meal.

274
00:30:01,330 --> 00:30:03,369
Okay. Bye.

275
00:30:04,500 --> 00:30:05,939
Why did you come so early?

276
00:30:06,810 --> 00:30:09,939
I couldn't sleep well because I was nervous on the kids' exam day.

277
00:30:11,679 --> 00:30:14,510
Even the great Ms. Nam Cheong Mi gets nervous too.

278
00:30:15,149 --> 00:30:16,750
Only during the kids' exam season.

279
00:30:17,449 --> 00:30:18,679
Don't worry.

280
00:30:18,820 --> 00:30:21,590
From the moms to the kids, you have great reviews.

281
00:30:23,719 --> 00:30:26,330
Reviews aren't done with words but with grades.

282
00:30:27,459 --> 00:30:28,530
Right.

283
00:30:43,240 --> 00:30:45,709
Hey, Min Ji. I'm on my way to work now.

284
00:30:46,310 --> 00:30:49,249
Send out a notice to tell the kids to send us their estimated scores...

285
00:30:49,250 --> 00:30:50,949
as soon as they're finished.

286
00:30:51,320 --> 00:30:53,789
And you know how some kids go silent when they tank their exams.

287
00:30:53,790 --> 00:30:54,990
Reach out to those kids separately.

288
00:30:55,820 --> 00:30:57,859
Yes. I'll stop by the bookstore before I go to work.

289
00:30:58,320 --> 00:30:59,330
Bye.

(Things to note during exams)

291
00:31:15,770 --> 00:31:17,480
Anyone has questions about the exam questions?

292
00:31:22,949 --> 00:31:23,949
Sir.

293
00:31:24,879 --> 00:31:26,619
Could I please have another OMR card?

294
00:31:27,050 --> 00:31:28,050
Here.

297
00:32:43,199 --> 00:32:45,030
Hey, Min Ji. The kids are finished, right?

298
00:32:45,429 --> 00:32:46,469
Yes, Ms. Seo.

299
00:32:47,469 --> 00:32:49,499
Yes, both Chanyoung and Heewon High Schools are finished.

300
00:32:49,500 --> 00:32:51,439
The kids have started sending in their estimated scores.

301
00:32:52,699 --> 00:32:54,468
From Heewon High, Si Woo, Hye Seung,

302
00:32:54,469 --> 00:32:55,569
Han Gyeol, and Yun Chan...

303
00:32:55,570 --> 00:32:57,209
got perfect scores on the multiple choice section.

304
00:32:58,080 --> 00:33:00,750
I think it'd take me some time to sort through Chanyoung High's.

305
00:33:00,949 --> 00:33:02,709
There are so many who got perfect scores on the multiple choice.

306
00:33:04,179 --> 00:33:05,850
I'll take a look at Chanyoung High's scores when I get to work.

307
00:33:06,189 --> 00:33:09,219
Gosh, having too many perfect scores on multiple choice is hard too.

308
00:33:09,760 --> 00:33:11,359
No, I feel great.

309
00:33:11,790 --> 00:33:14,260
But in that case, the grading for the short answers will get picky.

310
00:33:14,629 --> 00:33:15,760
Anyway, let's talk once I get there.

311
00:33:16,060 --> 00:33:18,030
Yes, please print out the exam papers that we got.

312
00:33:18,159 --> 00:33:20,030
Okay, Ms. Seo. I'll see you later.

313
00:33:23,169 --> 00:33:24,199
Gosh!

314
00:33:26,909 --> 00:33:27,909
Ms. Choi.

315
00:33:28,639 --> 00:33:30,009
Our predictions on three passages were correct.

316
00:33:30,010 --> 00:33:31,138
Oh, really?

317
00:33:31,139 --> 00:33:32,509
And from the classics too!

318
00:33:32,510 --> 00:33:34,409
Oh, my! Congratulations!

319
00:33:34,580 --> 00:33:35,580
This is awesome.

320

Hello.

321
00:33:36,649 --> 00:33:38,020
- Hello. - Hello.

322
00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:40,189
Gosh, I'm finally starting to feel less nervous.

323
00:33:40,490 --> 00:33:41,550
That's great.

00:33:41,949 --> 00:33:42,959

Here are Chanyoung High School's exam questions.

329
00:33:59,469 --> 00:34:02,980
Should I try to meet Mr. Pyo Sang Seob again?

330
00:34:03,709 --> 00:34:05,839
He didn't even think to open up the contract,

331
00:34:05,840 --> 00:34:07,949
so it was hard to talk to him.

332
00:34:09,080 --> 00:34:10,080
Leave it.

333
00:34:11,320 --> 00:34:12,350
Pardon?

You're early too, Mr. Lee.

339
00:35:18,650 --> 00:35:21,619
It seems like the kids who took exams today will have good results.

340
00:35:21,719 --> 00:35:22,960
I got the message too.

341
00:35:23,819 --> 00:35:25,219
If you're not too busy,

342
00:35:25,790 --> 00:35:27,158
could I have a 1-on-1 meeting with you for a bit?

343
00:35:27,159 --> 00:35:29,190
- Well, I'm a very busy person. - I see.

344
00:35:32,029 --> 00:35:33,270
It'll only take five minutes.

345

Did you send Seoung Gyu off well?

346
00:35:52,080 --> 00:35:54,049

What's this? I thought you didn't get nervous.

351
00:36:09,130 --> 00:36:11,939
I don't let on when I feel nervous or anxious.

00:36:11,940 --> 00:36:12,969

Then, why are you coming up from here?

362
00:36:54,810 --> 00:36:56,879
Oh, I left something after teaching class yesterday.

363
00:36:56,880 --> 00:36:57,920
How about you?

364
00:36:58,020 --> 00:37:00,150
Oh, I left my pouch in the classroom yesterday too.

365
00:37:01,389 --> 00:37:03,589
I must've been exhausted from doing makeup classes right before exams.

366
00:37:07,259 --> 00:37:08,989
Wait. But...

367
00:37:09,589 --> 00:37:12,298
Wasn't your class yesterday in the small lecture hall here,

368
00:37:12,299 --> 00:37:13,529
not downstairs?

369
00:37:14,869 --> 00:37:17,000
I was mistaken. I'm going to go there now.

370
00:37:17,600 --> 00:37:18,639
I see.

371
00:37:18,940 --> 00:37:21,040
I guess even you make such mistakes at times.

372
00:37:21,170 --> 00:37:22,670
I must be exhausted too.

373
00:37:24,110 --> 00:37:25,540
- Okay, then. - Bye.

374
00:37:32,020 --> 00:37:34,250
Leave the room later. And take the elevator on your way up.

375
00:37:56,880 --> 00:37:57,940
Mr. Lee?

376
00:37:58,839 --> 00:38:01,210
Oh, hi, Ms. Kim.

377
00:38:01,509 --> 00:38:03,679
Why did you come here before coming to the office?

378
00:38:04,980 --> 00:38:07,049
I came in early and decided to practice...

379
00:38:07,250 --> 00:38:08,690
on the blackboard.

380
00:38:08,949 --> 00:38:11,290
- Oh... - Why are you down here?

381
00:38:11,389 --> 00:38:13,259
I left something behind.

382
00:38:13,360 --> 00:38:14,589
I see.

383
00:38:15,230 --> 00:38:16,960
You're so hard-working,

384
00:38:17,230 --> 00:38:18,600
practicing right after the exam lecture.

385
00:38:19,199 --> 00:38:20,869
There's always a lot to do.

386
00:38:22,029 --> 00:38:23,100
You'll be a great instructor.

387
00:38:24,239 --> 00:38:26,338
Thank you. Bye, then.

388
00:38:26,339 --> 00:38:28,469
Do you know something?

389
00:38:29,170 --> 00:38:30,179
What?

390
00:38:30,839 --> 00:38:32,639
I'm the best at writing on the board.

391
00:38:34,409 --> 00:38:37,549
People sometimes say I'm even better than Ms. Seo.

392
00:38:38,650 --> 00:38:41,520
Yes. I heard through the grapevine.

393
00:38:42,889 --> 00:38:44,389
Do you need a special lecture?

394
00:38:46,429 --> 00:38:48,060
Will I have to break into...

395
00:38:48,429 --> 00:38:49,960
my savings to pay you for it?

396
00:38:52,230 --> 00:38:54,928
I'll give you a special deal.

397
00:38:54,929 --> 00:38:58,239
I'll teach you for the price of one dinner.

398
00:39:01,440 --> 00:39:03,539
Well, the thing is...

399
00:39:03,540 --> 00:39:05,879
Shall I help you with it right now?

400
00:39:05,880 --> 00:39:09,279
Oh, no. I think I should practice a bit first.

401
00:39:09,779 --> 00:39:11,819
Okay. Then...

402
00:39:13,150 --> 00:39:15,019
Text me after you practice.

403
00:39:15,020 --> 00:39:17,618
- I'll come and help you out. - No, it's fine.

404
00:39:17,619 --> 00:39:19,520
You don't have to refuse.

405
00:39:19,929 --> 00:39:21,190
I don't eat much.

406
00:39:37,080 --> 00:39:39,949
These were fine, but it's a shame Ye Eun got this wrong.

407
00:39:40,650 --> 00:39:42,810
- Right? - Yes. She must've been sloppy.

408
00:39:43,750 --> 00:39:45,079
I taught this.

409
00:39:45,080 --> 00:39:46,080
Excuse me.

410
00:39:47,750 --> 00:39:50,118
Hey. I'll go through the rest in my own time.

411
00:39:50,119 --> 00:39:51,460
- You can get back to work. - Okay.

412
00:40:00,069 --> 00:40:01,230
I'm locked up in here.

413
00:40:02,069 --> 00:40:04,400
Ms. Kim's going to check my blackboard skills.

414
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:31,429
Ms. Seo.

415
00:40:33,130 --> 00:40:34,130
Ms. Seo.

416
00:40:37,199 --> 00:40:38,339
What's wrong? Are you unwell?

417
00:41:02,230 --> 00:41:03,259
Shall I rescue you?

418
00:41:15,110 --> 00:41:16,170
Please.

419
00:41:17,139 --> 00:41:19,079
Can someone call Mr. Lee?

420
00:41:19,080 --> 00:41:21,210
Why isn't he in yet? I need to talk to him.

421
00:41:21,580 --> 00:41:23,619
- I'll call him. - He's here.

422
00:41:24,679 --> 00:41:26,650
He's downstairs practicing his board-writing.

423
00:41:27,250 --> 00:41:28,389
I'll call him.

424
00:41:29,790 --> 00:41:31,290
Lee Si Woo.

425
00:41:32,190 --> 00:41:33,290
Why are you here?

426
00:41:39,230 --> 00:41:42,230
Tell Mr. Lee to run upstairs.

427
00:41:43,540 --> 00:41:45,539
You're saying you got them all right...

428
00:41:45,540 --> 00:41:47,440
but not because you knew how or why?

429
00:41:48,210 --> 00:41:49,210
Yes.

430
00:41:49,710 --> 00:41:51,939
If not for the list of questions you gave me the day before,

431
00:41:51,940 --> 00:41:53,139
I'd have gotten it wrong.

432
00:41:57,449 --> 00:41:58,779
First, you deserve praise.

433
00:42:00,889 --> 00:42:02,319
If what you said was true,

434
00:42:02,650 --> 00:42:04,689
I'd have lost control at number five.

435
00:42:04,690 --> 00:42:07,359
But you got through the rest of the exam well.

436
00:42:07,360 --> 00:42:08,389
That's impressive.

437
00:42:11,730 --> 00:42:12,859
That's nothing.

438
00:42:12,860 --> 00:42:14,868
And second, even after getting it right,

439
00:42:14,869 --> 00:42:16,738
you thought about what it was that you didn't get.

440
00:42:16,739 --> 00:42:18,000
That's even more impressive.

441
00:42:18,969 --> 00:42:21,710
I'd have gotten it wrong if I didn't recognize the passage.

442
00:42:23,310 --> 00:42:26,210
Even now, I'm not sure what the options mean.

443
00:42:27,449 --> 00:42:29,409
I just memorized what you said...

444
00:42:29,779 --> 00:42:31,080
the traditional singer's soul meant...

445
00:42:31,380 --> 00:42:32,949
and guessed based on that.

446
00:42:33,819 --> 00:42:35,290
What Mr. Lee means...

447
00:42:35,420 --> 00:42:37,790
is that you're thinking on a high level.

448
00:42:38,089 --> 00:42:39,389
Students in their final year...

449
00:42:39,589 --> 00:42:42,659
and only just the best few wonder about that.

450
00:42:43,400 --> 00:42:46,028
Because it feels like literature isn't about finding...

451
00:42:46,029 --> 00:42:47,299
the answer among five options.

452
00:42:52,699 --> 00:42:53,710
What is it?

453
00:42:54,569 --> 00:42:55,670
That's exactly...

454
00:42:56,839 --> 00:42:58,080
how I feel.

455
00:43:01,449 --> 00:43:03,678
I want to take the exam with trust and belief...

456
00:43:03,679 --> 00:43:05,420
that I'm perfectly prepared.

457
00:43:07,290 --> 00:43:08,949
I'm like that with the other subjects.

458
00:43:10,020 --> 00:43:11,089
But Korean...

459
00:43:12,989 --> 00:43:14,130
Especially literature...

460
00:43:14,889 --> 00:43:16,630
I'm always left with that weird feeling.

461
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:21,469
That's why I bullheadedly try to solve more problems.

462
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:24,639
I spend more time studying,

463
00:43:25,170 --> 00:43:26,639
but I don't see an improvement.

464
00:43:27,069 --> 00:43:30,040
So the reason you came over as soon as the exam ended is?

465
00:43:31,440 --> 00:43:32,480
I just...

466
00:43:34,850 --> 00:43:36,150
You wanted to talk, right?

467
00:43:39,549 --> 00:43:42,589
Your friends would kill you if you said this at school.

468
00:43:42,750 --> 00:43:44,290
Especially boys.

469
00:43:44,420 --> 00:43:47,159
They'd say things like, "The jerk's showing off."

470
00:43:52,460 --> 00:43:54,569
- Yes. - I'm glad you came over.

471
00:43:55,130 --> 00:43:56,699
You gave me a great assignment.

472
00:43:58,670 --> 00:43:59,940
Can you help me?

473
00:44:03,310 --> 00:44:04,739
There's something you don't know.

474
00:44:05,480 --> 00:44:08,009
I do almost everything I set my mind to.

475
00:44:12,049 --> 00:44:13,350
I'm tasked with making sure...

476
00:44:13,989 --> 00:44:16,319
your Korean score stays at the top.

477
00:44:17,759 --> 00:44:19,119
But I just changed my goal.

478
00:44:23,799 --> 00:44:25,229
Will you send me to med school?

479
00:44:25,230 --> 00:44:26,730
It's not something that silly.

480
00:44:29,569 --> 00:44:31,670
I want to help you get full marks at the KSAT.

481
00:44:32,069 --> 00:44:33,239
The best student in the country.

482
00:44:34,710 --> 00:44:35,739
Okay?

483
00:44:36,639 --> 00:44:39,380
You'd better mention me when you're interviewed afterward.

484
00:44:40,409 --> 00:44:41,449
Okay.

485
00:44:45,179 --> 00:44:47,719
Si Woo's so serious about his studies.

486
00:44:53,529 --> 00:44:55,230
I suddenly got scared.

487
00:44:56,830 --> 00:44:59,360
Why did you say you'd help him get full marks in the KSAT?

488
00:45:00,100 --> 00:45:01,330
I'm not scared of that.

489
00:45:03,569 --> 00:45:05,799
I was wondering if I would lose the title of your favorite student.

490
00:45:08,909 --> 00:45:09,969
Does it not matter now?

491
00:45:10,679 --> 00:45:12,040
Because I'm not your favorite student anymore,

492
00:45:14,110 --> 00:45:15,110
but your boyfriend.

493
00:45:15,650 --> 00:45:16,920
Are you crazy?

494
00:45:21,219 --> 00:45:22,949
Academy life is so thrilling.

495
00:45:37,170 --> 00:45:41,009
(Chanyoung High School)

496
00:45:44,909 --> 00:45:46,080
This answer here.

497
00:45:47,250 --> 00:45:48,679
Should I deduct a point?

498
00:45:51,449 --> 00:45:54,589
Yes. It's missing the word "positive."

499
00:45:56,889 --> 00:45:58,460
It's still a good answer.

500
00:45:59,119 --> 00:46:02,659
We might have to deduct points for not putting a full stop.

501
00:46:03,460 --> 00:46:04,830
Be strict.

502
00:46:05,159 --> 00:46:07,069
You don't have to go that far.

503
00:46:08,770 --> 00:46:12,299
Should we have added more question so they'd be short on time?

504
00:46:13,869 --> 00:46:15,670
We lost to the students this time.

505
00:46:16,069 --> 00:46:17,310
They studied,

506
00:46:18,009 --> 00:46:19,810
understood the textbook, and did well.

507
00:46:20,179 --> 00:46:22,409
If the average score goes up, the teachers lose,

508
00:46:22,779 --> 00:46:23,920
and if it goes down, we win?

509
00:46:25,350 --> 00:46:27,020
Why even say such a thing?

510
00:46:28,150 --> 00:46:30,089
Because we must categorize their grades.

511
00:46:31,920 --> 00:46:34,460
We must line them up from first to last.

512
00:46:35,230 --> 00:46:36,790
That's why we're staring...

513
00:46:37,029 --> 00:46:39,129
at the short-answer questions trying to find reasons...

514
00:46:39,130 --> 00:46:41,130
to dock points until our eyes bleed.

515
00:46:43,100 --> 00:46:45,170
We just check if they paid attention in class.

516
00:46:46,469 --> 00:46:48,169
I wish I got hit by a car during...

517
00:46:48,170 --> 00:46:49,869
the grade confirmation period.

518
00:46:50,409 --> 00:46:51,440
Why would you...

519
00:46:53,440 --> 00:46:54,850
Don't say something like that.

520
00:46:56,279 --> 00:46:58,880
I know what the kids and their parents will say.

521
00:46:59,350 --> 00:47:00,650
I'd much prefer an accident.

522
00:47:00,819 --> 00:47:02,190
That doesn't scare me.

523
00:47:03,020 --> 00:47:04,459
Then will you go on...

524
00:47:04,460 --> 00:47:07,190
It must be so nice not to be scared by that.

525
00:47:08,389 --> 00:47:09,460
Ms. Lee.

526
00:47:10,190 --> 00:47:11,699
He's a full-time teacher.

527
00:47:12,500 --> 00:47:14,969
He'll never have the same stance as temporary teachers like us.

528
00:47:16,369 --> 00:47:17,639
That was foolish of me.

529
00:47:18,839 --> 00:47:20,569
I forgot the gap in our status.

530
00:47:21,369 --> 00:47:22,610
Stop it, Ms. Lee.

531
00:47:29,080 --> 00:47:30,819
Even full-time teachers like me...

532
00:47:31,750 --> 00:47:34,489
dislike getting complaints from students and parents.

533
00:47:35,790 --> 00:47:37,790
It's about our belief, not our status.

534
00:47:40,630 --> 00:47:41,759
What belief?

535
00:47:45,130 --> 00:47:47,000
Did you ever try to understand my intentions?

536
00:47:48,130 --> 00:47:51,000
Helping the students read and gain a broad understanding of...

537
00:47:53,239 --> 00:47:54,540
I quit.

538
00:47:57,139 --> 00:47:58,739
"Gain a broad understanding of the texts?"

539
00:47:59,310 --> 00:48:01,210
Who? The students?

540
00:48:03,409 --> 00:48:05,880
Do you really not get it or are you pretending not to?

541
00:48:09,489 --> 00:48:11,989
You all did well preparing for the final exams.

542
00:48:12,560 --> 00:48:14,230
Ms. Nam and Mr. Lee.

543
00:48:14,560 --> 00:48:16,759
Congratulations on getting through the first exam with us.

544
00:48:17,060 --> 00:48:19,830
You taught and led the students well.

545
00:48:20,600 --> 00:48:22,500
Thank you. You were a great help.

546
00:48:23,529 --> 00:48:26,198
Without your help, I wouldn't have been able to...

547
00:48:26,199 --> 00:48:28,540
figure out Pyo Sang Seob's style as well as I did.

548
00:48:29,969 --> 00:48:31,440
I must be lucky.

549
00:48:31,909 --> 00:48:33,678
Two great instructors joined...

550
00:48:33,679 --> 00:48:35,150
and settled in so quickly.

551
00:48:37,049 --> 00:48:39,779
Can we have a team dinner?

552
00:48:41,150 --> 00:48:42,190
Sounds good.

553
00:48:43,619 --> 00:48:45,989
Go to a classroom, grab any kid,

554
00:48:46,489 --> 00:48:48,460
and ask to see the material from their academy.

555
00:48:49,290 --> 00:48:51,330
Handouts and notes from their class and the others.

556
00:48:52,299 --> 00:48:54,500
They collected them all and had them memorize it for a month.

557
00:48:56,069 --> 00:48:59,400
They even pointed out which word we read in a higher tone.

558
00:48:59,600 --> 00:49:01,210
That's the academy instructor's job.

559
00:49:02,469 --> 00:49:05,540
Are we doing this to make instructors feel better?

560
00:49:05,739 --> 00:49:06,810
The textbook...

561
00:49:07,480 --> 00:49:09,650
is the most basic and organized frame of thought.

562
00:49:10,580 --> 00:49:13,619
- We must have a belief that... - If you care so much about belief,

563
00:49:14,650 --> 00:49:16,789
run for office as superintendent of education.

564
00:49:16,790 --> 00:49:19,020
- Ms. Lee. - I said I quit.

565
00:49:21,560 --> 00:49:23,130
At this rate, it's obvious...

566
00:49:23,900 --> 00:49:25,759
my evaluation will be a disaster.

567
00:49:27,630 --> 00:49:30,199
I'll be badmouthed online too.

568
00:49:31,339 --> 00:49:32,639
I want out before that happens.

569
00:49:35,670 --> 00:49:37,069
Then Ms. Lee,

570
00:49:38,580 --> 00:49:40,179
what do you think I should do?

571
00:49:41,250 --> 00:49:43,110
- Shall I really tell you? - Yes.

572
00:49:46,420 --> 00:49:48,589
We don't understand each other well.

573
00:49:51,659 --> 00:49:52,790
Can you just...

574
00:49:54,290 --> 00:49:55,889
not do anything?

575
00:49:58,799 --> 00:49:59,799
Please.

No, on the director's.

582
00:50:36,929 --> 00:50:38,569
He's pleased our team did well.

583
00:50:38,639 --> 00:50:40,199
- Goodness. - Nice.

584
00:50:41,440 --> 00:50:43,270
Mr. Lee must be sick of this.

585
00:51:09,830 --> 00:51:12,639
Can you just not do anything?

586
00:51:15,239 --> 00:51:16,270
Please.

591

Yes. He promised to mention me in his interview...

when he gets full marks.

593
00:52:59,040 --> 00:53:01,810

- Am I? - How are you so funny?

595
00:53:06,549 --> 00:53:07,750
That was crazy funny.

Neither of you majored in Korean, right?

612
00:53:44,089 --> 00:53:45,089
Right.

613
00:53:45,989 --> 00:53:48,060
Tell me if you need anything.

614
00:53:48,429 --> 00:53:49,659

616

Are you showing off that you majored in Korean?

617
00:53:55,130 --> 00:53:57,029
Yes. I showed off.

619
00:53:58,469 --> 00:54:00,199

Cheers, Mr. Lee.

What are your plans for the year-end?

625
00:54:11,449 --> 00:54:12,480
Right.

626
00:54:13,750 --> 00:54:16,618
I don't have any special plans.

627
00:54:16,619 --> 00:54:19,460
Why not? Visit Jeju Island. It's amazing.

You can stay the night.

630
00:54:23,230 --> 00:54:24,729
Is that what's special?

631
00:54:24,730 --> 00:54:25,829
- Yes. - It's fine.

632
00:54:25,830 --> 00:54:28,230
- It's nicer in the winter. - I can stay at the academy.

633
00:54:28,270 --> 00:54:30,869
No. I want to talk with you some more.

634
00:54:32,600 --> 00:54:34,139

635
00:54:34,839 --> 00:54:36,369
That's incredible.

636
00:54:36,639 --> 00:54:38,939
Can I stay for one more...

637
00:54:38,940 --> 00:54:41,008
- Let's just go. - I want to sing.

638
00:54:41,009 --> 00:54:43,249
- Bye. - I'll get her home.

00:54:43,250 --> 00:54:44,278
- Thanks. - Sure.

640
00:54:44,279 --> 00:54:45,679
- Take care. - Let's go.

641
00:54:45,850 --> 00:54:48,618
- Wait, I didn't... - We can go now.

642
00:54:48,619 --> 00:54:49,619

646
00:54:58,659 --> 00:55:00,600
Oh, no. I moved.

647
00:55:04,369 --> 00:55:05,969
To Ms. Seo's neighborhood.

648
00:55:09,569 --> 00:55:11,009
What's going on?

649
00:55:11,639 --> 00:55:12,710
Sorry.

650
00:55:25,560 --> 00:55:26,719
- Thanks. - Thank you.

651
00:55:26,860 --> 00:55:27,929
Drive safely.

652
00:55:29,460 --> 00:55:31,730
We'll get some stuff here. You can go home.

653
00:55:32,360 --> 00:55:33,699
I'll carry the stuff for you.

654
00:55:33,900 --> 00:55:36,029
It would be even better if you'd let me join in.

655
00:55:36,600 --> 00:55:38,639
Can you not be so nosy?

00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:41,810
- Hey. - What's going on?

657
00:55:42,670 --> 00:55:44,179
It's just me.

658
00:55:45,839 --> 00:55:46,940
Hello, Ms. Seo.

659
00:55:47,080 --> 00:55:49,080
- Long time no see, Seoung Gyu. - Yes.

660
00:55:49,179 --> 00:55:50,548
I heard, Ms. Seo.

661
00:55:50,549 --> 00:55:52,778
- I see. - Shouldn't you go home?

662
00:55:52,779 --> 00:55:54,419
- Yes. - Hey.

663
00:55:54,420 --> 00:55:55,449
See you.

664
00:55:57,020 --> 00:55:58,020
Bye.

665
00:56:10,330 --> 00:56:13,139
This is Ms. Nam Cheong Mi. She's on our team.

666
00:56:13,940 --> 00:56:16,839
This is my friend Choi Seoung Gyu. He's a post-grad student.

667
00:56:17,580 --> 00:56:19,940
His mother is our counselor Ms. Kim.

668
00:56:22,250 --> 00:56:23,610
My gosh.

669
00:56:27,020 --> 00:56:28,350
I feel so much better now.

670
00:56:28,489 --> 00:56:30,089
The suspense was killing me.

671
00:56:31,119 --> 00:56:32,520
We met, didn't we?

672
00:56:32,960 --> 00:56:35,290
Yes. Outside your apartment block.

673
00:56:35,989 --> 00:56:37,460
That's right.

674
00:56:38,730 --> 00:56:39,798
After I realized...

675
00:56:39,799 --> 00:56:42,529
Mr. Pyo taught at a school here,

676
00:56:42,569 --> 00:56:44,100
I went to see the counselor.

677
00:56:44,600 --> 00:56:46,698
To ask if I could teach a Chanyoung High class.

678
00:56:46,699 --> 00:56:47,739
I see.

679
00:56:48,710 --> 00:56:51,610
Are you allowed to discuss that so openly?

680
00:56:52,139 --> 00:56:53,540
Isn't that a trade secret?

681
00:56:54,750 --> 00:56:55,850
It's in the past.

682
00:56:56,250 --> 00:56:57,850
And I hate secrets.

683
00:57:00,179 --> 00:57:01,219
Hello.

684
00:57:01,619 --> 00:57:03,319
- Thanks. - Enjoy the food.

685
00:57:08,759 --> 00:57:10,190
There are kids like that.

686
00:57:10,529 --> 00:57:12,730
Reading's fine because there's a logic to it,

687
00:57:13,060 --> 00:57:15,670
but things like literature that need imagination is daunting.

688
00:57:16,469 --> 00:57:18,139
It's not the kids' fault.

689
00:57:18,639 --> 00:57:21,469
Neither school nor academies teach how to empathize with the author.

690
00:57:22,440 --> 00:57:25,839
It takes a lot of courage to actually do that.

691
00:57:27,339 --> 00:57:30,480
Can you even imagine or empathize during an exam?

692
00:57:31,650 --> 00:57:33,219
Isn't that too idealistic?

693
00:57:40,219 --> 00:57:42,960
Was it back in 2013?

694
00:57:43,830 --> 00:57:45,230
During a 12th-grade exam,

695
00:57:46,100 --> 00:57:48,230
all the students burst into tears.

696
00:57:48,929 --> 00:57:50,630
No Hee Kyung's work, right?

697
00:57:51,040 --> 00:57:52,040
Yes.

698
00:57:53,040 --> 00:57:55,509
A woman cared for her mother-in-law who had serious dementia,

699
00:57:55,869 --> 00:57:58,408
raised her kids well, and supported her husband.

700
00:57:58,409 --> 00:57:59,880
She was a hard-working mom.

701
00:58:00,980 --> 00:58:02,150
She's diagnosed with cancer.

702
00:58:03,110 --> 00:58:05,849
She says goodbye to each member of her family...

703
00:58:05,850 --> 00:58:07,080
before her life comes to an end.

704
00:58:08,150 --> 00:58:10,619
The last page of her script came up in the exam.

705
00:58:10,819 --> 00:58:13,690
All the kids bawled at that part.

706
00:58:14,060 --> 00:58:15,060
- Yes. - Yes.

707
00:58:15,790 --> 00:58:18,299
It is possible to imagine and empathize during an exam.

708
00:58:19,429 --> 00:58:21,798
There's just no guarantee it translates to good grades.

709
00:58:21,799 --> 00:58:24,000
That's no good, then.

710
00:58:25,770 --> 00:58:28,170
Hey. Don't you teach like that.

711
00:58:30,139 --> 00:58:31,779
Stay true to the duty of an academy.

712
00:58:32,480 --> 00:58:33,639
What is it?

713
00:58:34,480 --> 00:58:36,580
Isn't it to be repetitive and drill in the basics?

714
00:58:37,819 --> 00:58:40,350
Send lots of kids to med school and make yourself known.

715
00:58:41,750 --> 00:58:42,949
Don't you want to be a landlord?

716
00:58:44,759 --> 00:58:46,159
- I do. - Right.

717
00:58:48,889 --> 00:58:49,889
Also...

718
00:58:50,830 --> 00:58:51,900
Literature,

719
00:58:52,529 --> 00:58:54,900
history, the arts, and philosophy.

720
00:58:55,799 --> 00:58:57,569
You shouldn't teach that stuff in detail.

721
00:58:59,000 --> 00:59:01,169
I ended up like this, a history major, because it was...

722
00:59:01,170 --> 00:59:02,639
the major my KSAT scores allowed.

723
00:59:03,369 --> 00:59:04,880
Don't get anyone interested in that stuff.

724
00:59:07,409 --> 00:59:08,949
What do you mean you're "like this?"

725
00:59:11,480 --> 00:59:13,750
It's like... Yes.

726
00:59:14,750 --> 00:59:16,989
Even when I feel like ordering delivery like this,

727
00:59:17,020 --> 00:59:18,619
I shudder when I think of the bill.

728
00:59:18,889 --> 00:59:20,420
I'm a poor student of humanities.

729
00:59:21,759 --> 00:59:22,790
A surplus human?

730
00:59:23,360 --> 00:59:25,529
Yes. Dregs of society?

731
00:59:28,869 --> 00:59:30,429
Why do you talk like that?

732
00:59:33,739 --> 00:59:35,210
If everyone...

733
00:59:36,409 --> 00:59:38,210
treats studying like the people do here,

734
00:59:38,810 --> 00:59:40,080
the world would collapse.

735
00:59:41,279 --> 00:59:43,678
- What? - Studying because it's worth it...

736
00:59:43,679 --> 00:59:45,219
helped us grow as a society.

737
00:59:46,119 --> 00:59:48,790
Why talk like that when you're a scholar yourself?

738
00:59:49,549 --> 00:59:50,549
That's pathetic.

739
00:59:53,920 --> 00:59:54,960
What?

740
00:59:56,989 --> 01:00:00,860
Why was Si Woo so drawn to you and Mr. Lee?

741
01:00:01,969 --> 01:00:03,029
I want to know.

742
01:00:07,440 --> 01:00:08,869
Your free lecture.

743
01:00:10,139 --> 01:00:11,880
I liked and enjoyed it too,

744
01:00:12,880 --> 01:00:15,080
but it had nothing to do with improving grades.

745
01:00:16,380 --> 01:00:18,279
I think so too,

746
01:00:19,920 --> 01:00:22,020
but does it really have nothing to do with grades?

747
01:00:23,190 --> 01:00:24,420
I'm not so sure.

748
01:00:29,029 --> 01:00:31,630
Promise to tell me if you find the answer.

749
01:00:53,380 --> 01:00:56,520
Can I ask why you keep stealing my bed?

750
01:00:59,420 --> 01:01:01,929
Hey. Give me her number.

751
01:01:03,259 --> 01:01:04,600
That instructor.

752
01:01:05,299 --> 01:01:07,230
I could've beat her if I hadn't been drinking.

753
01:01:10,270 --> 01:01:11,299
Go to sleep.

754
01:01:13,869 --> 01:01:15,509
What a punk.

755
01:01:16,770 --> 01:01:20,439
(Woosung Apartments)

756

757
01:01:23,409 --> 01:01:26,380
(Special Lecture for the Winter Vacation)

758
01:01:42,569 --> 01:01:43,699
Where's Ms. Nam?

759
01:01:44,940 --> 01:01:47,069
She felt bedsores forming on her bottom.

760
01:01:47,699 --> 01:01:48,940
She went out for a walk.

761
01:01:49,710 --> 01:01:51,610
- Are you okay? - My bottom?

762
01:01:52,810 --> 01:01:54,380
You saw it for yourself last...

763
01:01:54,850 --> 01:01:55,949
Don't.

764
01:01:56,250 --> 01:01:58,020
- Have you lost your mind? - I won't talk.

765
01:01:59,420 --> 01:02:00,420
Darn you.

766
01:02:01,190 --> 01:02:02,190
How was it?

767
01:02:05,219 --> 01:02:06,219
Okay.

768
01:02:08,330 --> 01:02:11,959
You look amazing in suits because you're tall and slim.

769
01:02:11,960 --> 01:02:14,529
You don't look at all like the man who came in.

770
01:02:16,270 --> 01:02:17,469
Will you take this one?

771
01:02:17,969 --> 01:02:18,969
Yes.

772
01:02:19,739 --> 01:02:20,969
- I'll pay. - Okay.

773
01:02:29,080 --> 01:02:31,110
(Century Store)

774
01:02:33,949 --> 01:02:35,420
The director said...

775
01:02:35,889 --> 01:02:38,989
you're invited to dinner if you're free.

776
01:02:39,989 --> 01:02:43,889
I'm sorry, but I have plans today.

777
01:02:45,960 --> 01:02:47,230
I'll pass it on,

778
01:02:48,670 --> 01:02:49,699
Vice-director.

779
01:02:53,569 --> 01:02:54,569
No.

780
01:02:55,940 --> 01:02:57,770
I haven't yet resigned.

781
01:02:58,279 --> 01:02:59,509
That title is inappropriate.

782
01:03:00,779 --> 01:03:03,549
Plus, you're a TA.

783
01:03:04,750 --> 01:03:07,279
You don't have to act like my assistant.

784
01:03:08,790 --> 01:03:11,589
No, sir. I should and will, Vice-director.

785
01:03:14,389 --> 01:03:16,029
Where are you going next?

786
01:03:16,330 --> 01:03:17,690
I'll drive you.

787
01:03:18,400 --> 01:03:19,600
I apologize.

788
01:03:21,500 --> 01:03:23,000
Can you take these for me instead?

789
01:03:25,299 --> 01:03:27,069
Be sure to mention this.

790
01:03:27,270 --> 01:03:29,568
This bit of grammar was added after the textbooks were revised.

791
01:03:29,569 --> 01:03:32,310
Check the teachers' answers after each exam.

792
01:03:33,610 --> 01:03:34,710
Let's see the reading section.

793
01:03:35,080 --> 01:03:37,610
You tend to underestimate the kids' standards and levels.

794
01:03:38,219 --> 01:03:39,949
It's different from when you were a student.

795
01:03:40,920 --> 01:03:43,719
I don't underestimate them. I'm helping cement the basics.

796
01:03:44,960 --> 01:03:45,960
Open the file.

797
01:03:54,130 --> 01:03:55,199
Don't you regret it?

798
01:03:56,830 --> 01:03:57,900
Regret what?

799
01:03:59,000 --> 01:04:00,468
You'd have gotten a promotion this year...

800
01:04:00,469 --> 01:04:01,710
if you'd kept your job.

Assistant Manager Lee Jun Ho.

802
01:04:06,380 --> 01:04:07,810
I prefer being called a teacher.

803
01:04:14,049 --> 01:04:15,350
Hello, Ji Eun.

804
01:04:16,719 --> 01:04:18,259
Yes, I'm at work.

805
01:04:22,190 --> 01:04:23,790
I don't have a consultation today.

806
01:04:24,659 --> 01:04:27,100
I don't it's a consultation.

I will work at Choisun Academy.

810
01:05:20,480 --> 01:05:21,519
What did you just say?

811
01:05:21,520 --> 01:05:23,089
Wasn't it a rumor that you wanted?

812
01:05:23,489 --> 01:05:24,989
For no one but yourself.

813
01:05:25,560 --> 01:05:26,790
It's because of me.

814
01:05:26,920 --> 01:05:28,330
I want to turn back time.

815
01:05:29,029 --> 01:05:30,258
It's just a phone number.

816
01:05:30,259 --> 01:05:32,100
She's not at all interested in you.

817
01:05:32,230 --> 01:05:34,129
Don't you wish for failure in case...

819
01:05:36,069 --> 01:05:37,830
Good luck. Go for it.

820
01:05:39,299 --> 01:05:41,368
Ms. Seo is strong and capable enough.

821
01:05:41,369 --> 01:05:42,639
She is strong.

822
01:05:42,909 --> 01:05:44,670
But strong people get hurt too.

823
01:05:44,839 --> 01:05:46,480
I still want to be with you.

824
01:05:46,940 --> 01:05:47,980
I'll just be next to you.
