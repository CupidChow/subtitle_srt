 The Midnight Romance in Hagwon

00:00:44,650 --> 00:00:48,260
 Episode 4 

14
00:00:53,010 --> 00:00:57,420
 Level 1 Formula. Daechi Choe eon* Korean makes you the best.
(Choeseon= "best") 

15
00:00:57,420 --> 00:00:59,370
I think I'll screw up the exam today.

16
00:00:59,370 --> 00:01:02,100
As if you never screwed up before.

17
00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:04,080
Have some conscience.

18
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:05,640
Si Wu.

19
00:01:06,650 --> 00:01:08,850
Can we talk for a second?

20
00:01:12,500 --> 00:01:14,450
The class is starting soon.

21
00:01:14,450 --> 00:01:17,140
I know. It'll only take a second.

22
00:01:26,140 --> 00:01:28,060
Reserve my seat. My usual one.

23
00:01:28,060 --> 00:01:29,620
Got it.

24
00:01:32,990 --> 00:01:34,860
Have a seat there.

25
00:01:39,610 --> 00:01:41,880
Okay.

26
00:01:43,580 --> 00:01:47,660
I'll get right to the point since class starts soon.

27
00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:51,050
Have you seen this?

28
00:01:52,110 --> 00:01:55,200
Yes, I'm sure everyone did.

29
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:59,150
Are you going to go? To the free lecture?

30
00:01:59,150 --> 00:02:02,620
I'm not really interested.

31
00:02:02,620 --> 00:02:04,610
I see.

32
00:02:04,610 --> 00:02:09,900
Only the ones with bad grades blame the academy

33
00:02:09,900 --> 00:02:12,790
and switch around.

34
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:18,370
Well, that's not exactly why.

35
00:02:18,370 --> 00:02:22,010
I have designated time slots for each subject.

36
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:24,650
Yes.

37
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:29,710
That's important, too. It is, but...

38
00:02:29,710 --> 00:02:31,520
How about...

39
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:37,680
you try going to this lecture?

40
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:40,860
Take it and let me know how it was.

41
00:02:40,860 --> 00:02:42,920
Get me the handouts, too.

42
00:02:47,750 --> 00:02:49,350
Wh-Why?

43
00:02:50,150 --> 00:02:51,950
Because I'm curious.

44
00:02:54,020 --> 00:02:57,130
The other kids will go, anyway.

45
00:02:57,130 --> 00:02:59,680
Everyone talked about it at school today.

46
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:02,030
You focus on classes the most.

47
00:03:02,030 --> 00:03:04,170
You take thorough notes, too.

48
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:09,600
Does the director know, too?

49
00:03:10,890 --> 00:03:14,490
No. It's because I'm curious.

50
00:03:18,590 --> 00:03:24,030
Your parents like that you're a scholarship student here, right?

51
00:03:25,930 --> 00:03:29,940
I'm thankful for that.

52
00:03:32,170 --> 00:03:34,170
Please do me a favor.

53
00:03:34,970 --> 00:03:36,490
Please?

54
00:03:39,460 --> 00:03:41,990
Take thorough notes, too.

55
00:03:43,020 --> 00:03:45,130
Let's go home.

56
00:03:46,030 --> 00:03:55,030


57
00:03:59,850 --> 00:04:03,040
- Ms. Seo, I'll leave first.
 - Yes, see you.

58
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:13,090
Ms. Seo, buy me a drink after class.

59
00:04:13,730 --> 00:04:16,180
Can't we talk during the day tomorrow?

60
00:04:16,180 --> 00:04:20,460
You can do that much for me, too, right?

61
00:04:20,460 --> 00:04:22,280
I'm a teammate, too.

62
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:23,700
Okay.

63
00:04:23,700 --> 00:04:25,980
I can choose the spot, right?

64
00:04:25,980 --> 00:04:27,130
Of course.

65
00:04:27,130 --> 00:04:29,500
I'll send you the address. Meet me around 10:30.

66
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:31,030
There's one that's open until late.

67
00:04:31,030 --> 00:04:32,400
Okay.

68
00:04:34,300 --> 00:04:37,480
Mr. Lee can go home early.

69
00:04:52,580 --> 00:04:56,160
Well, Ms. Nam?

70
00:05:03,690 --> 00:05:06,560
One short-answer question with high scores

71
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:09,640
can change your school grades.

72
00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:16,220
Those grades might become your social status in the future.

73
00:05:16,220 --> 00:05:18,500
The university you'll go to,

74
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:21,120
the job you'll get,

75
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:24,620
and the attractiveness of your blind date

76
00:05:24,620 --> 00:05:29,750
might depend on one short-answer question in a school exam.

77
00:05:31,140 --> 00:05:33,770
Don't think it's unfair.

78
00:05:33,770 --> 00:05:38,220
Just be thankful there's a way to change your status

79
00:05:38,220 --> 00:05:41,930
in this society for the sake of your mental health.

80
00:05:43,640 --> 00:05:47,090
 Eunma Apartments Public Parking Lot 

81
00:05:47,090 --> 00:05:51,170
Hey, what are you? A high schooler? Why the convenience store?

82
00:05:58,660 --> 00:06:00,790
Whatever. Just drink.

83
00:06:00,790 --> 00:06:02,720
Don't you have work in the afternoon tomorrow?

84
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:04,250
Who cares?

85
00:06:04,250 --> 00:06:08,100
I have an important class on the weekend. I have a lot to study.

86
00:06:10,310 --> 00:06:13,150
You sound like a star lecturer already.

87
00:06:13,150 --> 00:06:16,480
Are you happy that a gigantic picture of your face is displayed on major streets?

88
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:19,130
Hey, I'm not kidding.

89
00:06:19,130 --> 00:06:22,400
Now is a crucial moment to start with a big bang.

90
00:06:24,310 --> 00:06:26,260
Do you find the job doable?

91
00:06:27,590 --> 00:06:29,700
It's crazy fun.

92
00:06:29,700 --> 00:06:31,190
It suits me.

93
00:06:31,190 --> 00:06:33,800
Why does your face look so bad, then?

94
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:35,180
Can you tell?

95
00:06:35,180 --> 00:06:37,130
Yes.

96
00:06:37,130 --> 00:06:40,510
There's just something I'm concerned about.

97
00:06:41,310 --> 00:06:43,370
Is this what they call fame?

98
00:06:43,370 --> 00:06:45,880
Give me a f***ing break.

99
00:06:47,570 --> 00:06:49,820
What is it?

100
00:07:15,330 --> 00:07:17,520
Welcome.

101
00:07:19,650 --> 00:07:22,320
I'm late because the students asked so many questions today.

102
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:24,590
You should've started eating.

103
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:30,290
Welcome, Ms. Seo.

104
00:07:30,290 --> 00:07:32,230
Hello.

105
00:07:48,860 --> 00:07:52,190
I should've invited you first.

106
00:07:52,190 --> 00:07:53,460
Why?

107
00:07:53,460 --> 00:07:55,910
You probably felt disappointed.

108
00:07:55,910 --> 00:07:57,590
About what?

109
00:07:59,190 --> 00:08:02,290
I planned a joint lecture with Mr. Lee secretly

110
00:08:02,290 --> 00:08:05,890
and only put him in the ad.

111
00:08:05,890 --> 00:08:07,480
All of these things.

112
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:11,150
Yes, I was devastated.

113
00:08:11,780 --> 00:08:13,170
I'm sorry.

114
00:08:13,170 --> 00:08:16,000
If we start a Huiwon High class, you'll also—

115
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,190
You don't have to apologize.

116
00:08:19,010 --> 00:08:21,580
I learned a lot, thanks to you.

117
00:08:23,170 --> 00:08:24,910
I...

118
00:08:28,490 --> 00:08:32,060
care about other people as a habit.

119
00:08:32,060 --> 00:08:33,990
Without knowing my place.

120
00:08:35,350 --> 00:08:38,300
That was never my plan.

121
00:08:38,300 --> 00:08:43,380
I tell myself I just need to focus on myself and fill my lecture room.

122
00:08:43,380 --> 00:08:48,810
But I catch myself worrying about other people's situations in the end.

123
00:08:49,410 --> 00:08:53,630
I got betrayed seriously at my previous job because of that.

124
00:08:54,330 --> 00:08:55,810
Ms. Nam...

125
00:08:55,810 --> 00:09:01,450
I let a first-year lecturer use my teaching material because I pitied his situation.

126
00:09:01,450 --> 00:09:03,310
But in the end,

127
00:09:03,310 --> 00:09:07,410
he used that to get higher pay somewhere else.

128
00:09:07,410 --> 00:09:11,170
He put his name on the textbook and took the students with him, too.

129
00:09:11,170 --> 00:09:12,760
Isn't that unbelievable?

130
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:16,270
So, what are you trying to tell me?

131
00:09:16,270 --> 00:09:20,950
If I had known you were planning something so big with Mr. Lee,

132
00:09:20,950 --> 00:09:25,780
I would've changed my mind and done what I wanted to do.

133
00:09:25,780 --> 00:09:26,970
Like what?

134
00:09:26,970 --> 00:09:30,770
I wanted to start a Chanyeong High class.

135
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:34,410
Chanyeong High is my main focus.

136
00:09:34,410 --> 00:09:36,230
Yes, I know.

137
00:09:36,230 --> 00:09:37,880
But?

138
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:47,210
Pyo Sang Seob.

139
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:52,470
He taught for four years at Guksa Polytechnic High before joining Chanyeong High.

140
00:09:52,470 --> 00:09:56,240
And I've been producing No. 1 students there for three years.

141
00:09:57,790 --> 00:10:01,540
I found out Mr. Pyo joined Chanyeong High a few days ago.

142
00:10:02,420 --> 00:10:05,640
I really wanted to start a Chanyeong High class,

143
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:08,090
but I held back.

144
00:10:08,090 --> 00:10:11,400
Of course, it's very important to understand the teacher well,

145
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:14,050
but there's no guarantee this will lead to success—

146
00:10:14,050 --> 00:10:18,880
Ms. Seo, I've never worked in Daechi-dong before.

147
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:23,210
I'm unfamiliar with the schools and don't know anyone here.

148
00:10:23,210 --> 00:10:27,410
This was my precious ray of hope.

149
00:10:30,490 --> 00:10:33,270
But I just gave up

150
00:10:33,270 --> 00:10:35,570
since it's your school.

151
00:10:35,570 --> 00:10:42,090
I heard Choeseon or Choeseon's famous director was going for it, too.

152
00:10:42,090 --> 00:10:45,130
"Let's not get involved and make things complicated."

153
00:10:45,130 --> 00:10:48,470
Yes.  That's what I thought, I guess.

154
00:10:51,380 --> 00:10:53,710
Gosh, seriously.

155
00:10:53,710 --> 00:10:56,620
Isn't this so pathetic?

156
00:10:56,620 --> 00:10:58,780
I understand how you feel.

157
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:01,720
I don't think so

158
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:05,280
since you have hundreds of students in this neighborhood.

159
00:11:06,970 --> 00:11:09,520
So, you wanted to see me today because—

160
00:11:10,430 --> 00:11:15,300
I'll start a Chanyeong High class for the special lectures for finals.

161
00:11:26,250 --> 00:11:28,260
 Ms. Seo, I'm nearby. 

162
00:11:28,260 --> 00:11:30,170
 Let me know when you're done. 

163
00:11:30,170 --> 00:11:32,400
 And don't drink too much. 

164
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:33,570
 The lecture is right around the corner. 

165
00:11:33,570 --> 00:11:36,000
No matter what people say,

166
00:11:37,470 --> 00:11:39,940
you did the right thing, Jun Ho.

167
00:11:39,950 --> 00:11:41,600
Wow, seriously.

168
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:43,710
You little snake.

169
00:11:43,710 --> 00:11:47,300
You said Jun Ho finally lost his mind.

170
00:11:47,300 --> 00:11:51,140
I've been thinking a lot,

171
00:11:51,140 --> 00:11:53,850
but Lee Jun Ho has the most promising future.

172
00:11:54,980 --> 00:11:57,420
You have the second most promising future.

173
00:11:57,420 --> 00:12:00,550
You little. You're predicting the future correctly.

174
00:12:00,550 --> 00:12:03,230
No matter what I do, people call me a trash reporter

175
00:12:03,230 --> 00:12:06,140
and they call him a slave grad student.

176
00:12:06,140 --> 00:12:10,140
You're the most likely to succeed among us.

177
00:12:10,140 --> 00:12:12,040
You're a teacher, to begin with.

178
00:12:12,040 --> 00:12:15,570
Hey, I'll become a professor soon, too.

179
00:12:15,570 --> 00:12:17,260
Yes, Lee Jun Ho still wins.

180
00:12:17,260 --> 00:12:20,500
- How?
 - By the time you become full-time,

181
00:12:20,500 --> 00:12:23,990
he might build a building in Gangnam and retire.

182
00:12:24,990 --> 00:12:27,850
Only if you get very successful, of course.

183
00:12:27,850 --> 00:12:30,500
Hey, I'll get a building worst-case scenario.

184
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:34,200
If it works out, you'll have to buy my academy's stock.

185
00:12:38,430 --> 00:12:40,200
 I'm at the academy. 

186
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,490
Don't drink too much and go home. I'm leaving.

187
00:12:43,490 --> 00:12:44,920
You're ditching us?

188
00:12:44,920 --> 00:12:46,290
I'll be in touch,

189
00:12:46,290 --> 00:12:48,580
although I can't see you for a while. Bye.

190
00:12:48,580 --> 00:12:50,200
Hey, hey, Lee Jun Ho! Hey!

191
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:52,750
Just leave him.

192
00:12:52,750 --> 00:12:55,800
Let's go inside somewhere. It's so cold.

193
00:13:15,780 --> 00:13:17,170
Why didn't you go home?

194
00:13:17,170 --> 00:13:21,340
I was going to let you go home since you worked hard until dawn.

195
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:27,400
I felt like going home early, too, but I changed my mind after seeing your text.

196
00:13:28,270 --> 00:13:29,580
Let's go to the classroom.

197
00:13:29,580 --> 00:13:31,660
Everyone found out about our tactic.

198
00:13:31,660 --> 00:13:34,680
We can prepare the class publicly now.

199
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:40,120
- Is something going on?
 - What do you mean?

200
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:43,000
Is Ms. Nam really angry?

201
00:13:44,970 --> 00:13:49,050
She wants to start a Chanyeong High class for the finals.

202
00:13:49,050 --> 00:13:50,880
What?

203
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:53,460
I wonder if I focused too much on Huiwon High.

204
00:13:53,460 --> 00:13:55,970
I need to check Chanyeong High again.

205
00:13:55,970 --> 00:13:58,620
How could she be so unreasonable?

206
00:13:58,620 --> 00:14:01,560
- I'll try talking to Ms. Nam in person.
 - About what?

207
00:14:01,560 --> 00:14:04,520
Is going after you the best she can do in this crucial time?

208
00:14:04,520 --> 00:14:06,070
It's not like that.

209
00:14:06,070 --> 00:14:07,340
What do you mean it's not?

210
00:14:07,340 --> 00:14:11,180
I have no right to stop her from starting a class. It's up to her.

211
00:14:11,180 --> 00:14:13,890
But there's such a thing as business ethics.

212
00:14:14,830 --> 00:14:18,150
You'd get shot if you told Ms. Nam that.

213
00:14:18,150 --> 00:14:20,700
- Then, do nothing?
 - I didn't say that.

214
00:14:20,700 --> 00:14:24,800
You need to prove that you weren't chosen due to special treatment.

215
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:26,340
Follow me.

216
00:14:30,380 --> 00:14:33,970
 Teacher-Pupil Tag Team 

217
00:14:33,970 --> 00:14:37,150
 Lee Jun Ho and Seo Hye Jin 

218
00:14:37,150 --> 00:14:43,360
 Bus No. 2413 is arriving shortly. 

219
00:14:45,740 --> 00:14:50,890
It felt strange to see his face printed so gigantic

220
00:14:50,890 --> 00:14:53,570
on the streets.

221
00:14:58,060 --> 00:15:02,340
Will he become successful like he said?

222
00:15:03,770 --> 00:15:06,420
He'll still be an academy teacher.

223
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:10,610
Things might change if he becomes successful.

224
00:15:11,410 --> 00:15:16,610
Someone apparently owns hundreds of millions worth of properties in Gangnam.

225
00:15:18,900 --> 00:15:21,460
Did he find a place to move to?

226
00:15:21,460 --> 00:15:23,940
He hasn't told me yet.

227
00:15:27,970 --> 00:15:30,960
You shouldn't have provoked him like that.

228
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:35,180
He gets off at dawn every day.

229
00:15:35,180 --> 00:15:37,980
You should've just let him commute from home.

230
00:15:37,980 --> 00:15:43,270
That way, I could have at least fed him well.

231
00:15:43,270 --> 00:15:46,680
He needs to know the world is harsh, too.

232
00:15:46,680 --> 00:15:51,470
He thinks he deserves what we provide for him.

233
00:15:52,540 --> 00:15:54,680
Will you keep being so negative?

234
00:15:54,680 --> 00:15:56,400
It's about your son.

235
00:15:56,400 --> 00:15:59,100
His ideals are wrong to begin with.

236
00:16:10,990 --> 00:16:14,450
This piece can yield many kinds of questions.

237
00:16:14,450 --> 00:16:19,260
Understanding the text, structure, the meaning of the theme, what it symbolizes, and the vocabulary.

238
00:16:19,260 --> 00:16:22,800
It's basically like Transformers.

239
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:25,720
Mention that people get content questions wrong frequently.

240
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:27,130
Take out the Transformers part.

241
00:16:27,130 --> 00:16:29,020
Okay.

242
00:16:29,020 --> 00:16:31,360
How about you change the text?

243
00:16:32,460 --> 00:16:34,450
It's too long.

244
00:16:34,450 --> 00:16:36,440
There's too much writing on the board, too.

245
00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:39,800
It doesn't feel like a preview lecture.

246
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:41,720
- But still—
 - Huiwon High is a boys' school.

247
00:16:41,720 --> 00:16:45,750
Boys' schools need to be approached differently than co-ed and girls' schools.

248
00:16:45,750 --> 00:16:48,560
Boys tend to be bad at taking notes and—

249
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:50,530
But it's a great piece.

250
00:16:51,400 --> 00:16:54,350
There are no bad pieces in the textbook.

251
00:16:54,350 --> 00:16:57,660
A good piece is not necessarily good for selling.

252
00:16:59,180 --> 00:17:01,320
- Selling—
 - Don't try to be different.

253
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:07,100
You need to show effectively that you can improve their grades.

254
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:11,560
I'll redesign the blackboard writing.

255
00:17:11,560 --> 00:17:13,290
Continue.

256
00:17:18,610 --> 00:17:20,480
The author, Park Wan Seo, is—

257
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:23,550
Take out the author introduction. Focus on the perfect score strategies.

258
00:17:23,550 --> 00:17:26,470
The exam will be based on the textbook anyway.

259
00:17:26,470 --> 00:17:30,920
Explain the words more if you have time for that.

260
00:17:32,890 --> 00:17:35,730
Are you sure you checked the school's exam trends?

261
00:17:36,690 --> 00:17:39,670
- Yes.
 - Tell me what they are.

262
00:17:39,670 --> 00:17:45,260
The essay questions are often on the theme, and the protagonist's introspection.

263
00:17:45,260 --> 00:17:50,390
The multiple-choice questions have a lot of traps regarding the story,

264
00:17:50,390 --> 00:17:53,030
and there's always an entrance-exam-style question for the vocabulary.

265
00:17:53,030 --> 00:17:56,570
So, what are you doing instead?

266
00:18:06,710 --> 00:18:08,620
I feel weird.

267
00:18:09,580 --> 00:18:10,920
About what?

268
00:18:10,920 --> 00:18:14,330
You didn't teach me like that back then.

269
00:18:14,330 --> 00:18:17,220
- What did I do?
 - You made me enjoy reading

270
00:18:17,220 --> 00:18:20,790
and the question-answering process.

271
00:18:20,790 --> 00:18:23,100
So, it was about...

272
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:28,490
making me feel ecstatic when my interpretation was correct.

273
00:18:28,490 --> 00:18:33,070
And you made me curious about the part the textbook didn't show.

274
00:18:33,070 --> 00:18:36,460
Focus. Aren't you after a large-scale lecture now?

275
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:40,990
Do we just need to predict the exam questions better?

276
00:18:40,990 --> 00:18:43,410
What else do we need to do?

277
00:18:43,410 --> 00:18:45,010
Tell me.

278
00:18:48,700 --> 00:18:50,120
The opponent is the Gray Witch.

279
00:18:50,120 --> 00:18:53,660
We persuaded Director Kim to do this when he tried to run away.

280
00:18:53,660 --> 00:18:57,880
I promised the team leaders Huiwon High classes, too.

281
00:18:57,880 --> 00:19:02,600
Ms. Nam and the other teachers hate us.

282
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:06,300
Stop arguing and do as I say. I'm right.

283
00:19:29,030 --> 00:19:31,460
I understand my job now.

284
00:19:32,930 --> 00:19:34,740
We'll practice using a mic tomorrow.

285
00:19:34,740 --> 00:19:36,430
It makes your hands move differently.

286
00:19:36,430 --> 00:19:39,020
You need to get used to it.

287
00:19:39,020 --> 00:19:40,830
Okay.

288
00:19:40,830 --> 00:19:43,930
Go in. Good work today.

289
00:19:44,730 --> 00:19:46,410
I wish you...

290
00:19:47,830 --> 00:19:49,570
a good night.

291
00:19:52,370 --> 00:19:53,940
I'll go.

292
00:20:54,860 --> 00:20:57,630
Attorney Cha, what's up at this hour?

293
00:20:57,630 --> 00:20:59,480
Hey.

294
00:20:59,480 --> 00:21:01,800
This old man...

295
00:21:01,800 --> 00:21:04,750
He drank two glasses with a customer.

296
00:21:04,750 --> 00:21:06,820
I came to pick him up.

297
00:21:06,820 --> 00:21:10,990
I'm an attorney, you know. How could he treat me like this?

298
00:21:10,990 --> 00:21:14,230
I love you, attorney wife.

299
00:21:16,020 --> 00:21:18,560
Huh? Whoa.

300
00:21:18,560 --> 00:21:20,870
I saw your new ad.

301
00:21:20,870 --> 00:21:22,830
What a sight.

302
00:21:22,830 --> 00:21:24,870
It's brightening up the whole neighborhood.

303
00:21:24,870 --> 00:21:26,750
It's that guy from last time, right?

304
00:21:26,750 --> 00:21:29,810
Yes, I caused trouble properly this time.

305
00:21:29,810 --> 00:21:32,040
What do you think?

306
00:21:32,040 --> 00:21:36,410
Oh, do you have time this weekend?

307
00:21:36,410 --> 00:21:39,170
I have an event.

308
00:21:39,170 --> 00:21:42,300
It's not a party. We don't know how it'll go.

309
00:21:42,300 --> 00:21:45,680
Why bother with the result? It's obvious.

310
00:21:45,680 --> 00:21:47,870
You're Seo Hye Jin.

311
00:21:47,870 --> 00:21:53,000
I'll prepare a spread and wait for you, okay?

312
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,440
Okay, then.

313
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:57,880
Drive safely.

314
00:21:57,880 --> 00:22:00,310
Okay. Fine.

315
00:22:00,310 --> 00:22:01,990
Okay.

316
00:23:32,540 --> 00:23:34,250
 Power Off 

317
00:24:06,290 --> 00:24:10,680
You should've taken these out ahead of time.

318
00:24:10,680 --> 00:24:14,080
 Teacher-Pupil Tag Team 

319
00:24:15,930 --> 00:24:18,800
Tell him to come out. I want to hear about this.

320
00:24:18,800 --> 00:24:21,140
He's already gone.

321
00:24:27,950 --> 00:24:33,170
 Park Wan Seo's "Camera and Boot" 

322
00:24:53,980 --> 00:25:01,030
 Park Wan Seo's "Camera and Boot" 

323
00:25:01,720 --> 00:25:03,350
Hey.

324
00:25:03,350 --> 00:25:05,970
Is that so? That much?

325
00:25:08,110 --> 00:25:10,670
Okay, got it.

326
00:25:10,670 --> 00:25:13,820
Make sure to keep the class material secure.

327
00:25:13,820 --> 00:25:16,540
They'll blame us if it gets leaked.

328
00:25:17,260 --> 00:25:21,020
Okay. We're arriving in 10 minutes.

329
00:25:23,490 --> 00:25:26,480
I'm not sure yet,

330
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:30,420
but about 50 students will go to Seo Hye Jin's free lecture.

331
00:25:31,130 --> 00:25:34,750
It'll end up being more.

332
00:25:34,750 --> 00:25:38,800
It's like eating fast food, you know.

333
00:25:50,090 --> 00:25:52,370
 Teacher-Pupil Tag Team 

334
00:26:01,300 --> 00:26:04,010
You need to eat better when you're busy.

335
00:26:08,680 --> 00:26:13,620
Right, I heard the free lecture is full.

336
00:26:13,620 --> 00:26:17,300
Yes, we'll have to probably make it first come, first served.

337
00:26:19,080 --> 00:26:21,680
Is Jun Ho preparing well?

338
00:26:21,680 --> 00:26:25,140
There isn't a lot of time.

339
00:26:25,140 --> 00:26:27,230
I'm glad it's a joint lecture.

340
00:26:27,230 --> 00:26:29,440
I would've been scared if he were my competitor.

341
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:30,880
He's that good?

342
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:32,560
You know he's smart.

343
00:26:32,560 --> 00:26:35,430
I suppose. He learns anything quickly.

344
00:26:37,040 --> 00:26:38,820
You don't have to worry.

345
00:26:38,820 --> 00:26:40,410
What do you mean, worry?

346
00:26:40,410 --> 00:26:43,140
I never worried once.

347
00:26:43,140 --> 00:26:44,370
Really?

348
00:26:44,370 --> 00:26:48,160
Of course. I'm just looking forward to it.

349
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:52,530
But this might make you worry.

350
00:26:52,530 --> 00:26:53,740
What do you mean?

351
00:26:53,740 --> 00:26:58,020
I think Ms. Nam will start a Chanyeong High class.

352
00:27:00,980 --> 00:27:02,380
I've heard nothing about it.

353
00:27:02,380 --> 00:27:04,560
The assistant director will tell you soon.

354
00:27:04,560 --> 00:27:06,800
I found out about it sooner.

355
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:14,590
I appreciate your ambition, but two teachers per school?

356
00:27:14,590 --> 00:27:16,890
Our academy has never done that before.

357
00:27:16,890 --> 00:27:20,240
Why don't you hear her out?

358
00:27:21,590 --> 00:27:28,550
We need evidence that you're as good as Ms. Seo.

359
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:33,250
 Chanyeong High, 10th Grade - Previous Exams 

360
00:27:33,250 --> 00:27:35,490
I'm confident I can do well.

361
00:27:38,410 --> 00:27:42,950
She'll let her do it 100%.

362
00:27:42,950 --> 00:27:49,060
The assistant director has been looking for your competitor for years now.

363
00:27:50,620 --> 00:27:54,420
I can oppose it if you want.

364
00:27:54,420 --> 00:27:57,170
No, that'd be cowardly.

365
00:27:57,170 --> 00:27:59,560
I'll work a little harder.

366
00:28:01,820 --> 00:28:05,250
You prepare during the day and give lectures at night.

367
00:28:05,250 --> 00:28:07,580
And you tutor Jun Ho afterward.

368
00:28:07,580 --> 00:28:11,650
You're about to be worn out at this rate.

369
00:28:11,650 --> 00:28:13,890
You need to see what we prepared.

370
00:28:13,890 --> 00:28:15,740
I don't have to.

371
00:28:15,740 --> 00:28:18,040
I'll just come to the lecture.

372
00:28:18,040 --> 00:28:21,430
You've given thousands of lectures and

373
00:28:21,430 --> 00:28:24,780
you must've taught Jun Ho well.

374
00:28:24,780 --> 00:28:27,530
Jun Ho's portion will be good.

375
00:28:27,530 --> 00:28:30,050
You sure do love your student.

376
00:28:48,440 --> 00:28:50,290
Have a seat.

377
00:28:53,590 --> 00:28:56,780
I'm sorry for making everyone come early.

378
00:28:56,780 --> 00:28:59,470
No, it's okay.

379
00:29:00,610 --> 00:29:02,370
How are you finding everything?

380
00:29:02,370 --> 00:29:05,590
Everything's great, thanks to your consideration.

381
00:29:05,590 --> 00:29:08,180
It's much better than working at school.

382
00:29:08,180 --> 00:29:13,100
I admire you for giving up the comfortable position.

383
00:29:13,100 --> 00:29:14,520
You're too kind.

384
00:29:14,520 --> 00:29:20,590
I was surprised that you were preparing so much for the usual lecture.

385
00:29:20,590 --> 00:29:23,430
Habits are one's worst enemies.

386
00:29:23,430 --> 00:29:24,850
Let's look at the material.

387
00:29:24,850 --> 00:29:26,440
Okay.

388
00:29:29,140 --> 00:29:32,890
"Camera and Boot" is set in the '70s.

389
00:29:32,890 --> 00:29:37,440
"I," who encountered the beginning of industrialization, is the narrator.

390
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:41,050
It will be a first-person narrative, then.

391
00:29:41,050 --> 00:29:42,790
The narrative style.

392
00:29:42,790 --> 00:29:46,260
This is the first key point.

393
00:29:46,260 --> 00:29:49,670
There are questions you can solve just by knowing that.

394
00:29:49,670 --> 00:29:54,050
The first question in the handout is a prime example.

395
00:29:54,050 --> 00:29:56,620
Let's have a look.

396
00:29:56,620 --> 00:30:00,090
You don't have to read the text with questions like this.

397
00:30:00,090 --> 00:30:04,680
You need to answer it in a minute after identifying the question.

398
00:30:04,680 --> 00:30:07,980
It's all good, but can you make it shorter?

399
00:30:07,980 --> 00:30:10,920
Huiwon High's Korean exams are all about speed.

400
00:30:10,920 --> 00:30:14,230
Buying as much time as possible for the essay questions is key.

401
00:30:14,230 --> 00:30:19,390
But a question requires identifying the perspectives of the protagonist and observer.

402
00:30:19,390 --> 00:30:20,950
Right.

403
00:30:22,890 --> 00:30:25,760
I prepared an example text. Here.

404
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:28,190
What's this?

405
00:30:29,260 --> 00:30:32,820
I'm fine with adding another text, but let's choose something else.

406
00:30:32,820 --> 00:30:35,060
Natsume Soseki won't be in the exam.

407
00:30:35,060 --> 00:30:36,540
But it'll help with understanding.

408
00:30:36,540 --> 00:30:39,990
You can't demand understanding in a preview lecture.

409
00:30:39,990 --> 00:30:42,870
If you want to choose foreign literature, it would be better ...

410
00:30:42,870 --> 00:30:45,720
Yes, let's use "The Great Gatsby."

411
00:30:45,720 --> 00:30:48,770
We can promote our English class, too.

412
00:30:48,770 --> 00:30:50,570
I'll change it, then.

413
00:30:51,220 --> 00:30:53,870
I think you're using your throat too much.

414
00:30:53,870 --> 00:30:55,820
Did you practice speaking with vocal cords open?

415
00:30:55,820 --> 00:30:57,530
Yes, I found a tutorial.

416
00:30:57,530 --> 00:30:59,860
Take care of your throat for the future.

417
00:30:59,860 --> 00:31:01,040
Got it.

418
00:31:01,040 --> 00:31:02,800
Finish the rest.

419
00:31:02,800 --> 00:31:07,420
Don't obsess over time too much with story questions.

420
00:31:07,420 --> 00:31:11,200
The teachers will set countless traps

421
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:14,740
so you can't a the perfect score.

422
00:31:14,740 --> 00:31:16,240
It's important to secure scores,

423
00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:20,510
but it's way more important not to take risks, okay?

424
00:31:20,510 --> 00:31:22,810
Let's look at the handout.

425
00:31:22,810 --> 00:31:25,950
I categorized the booby traps.

426
00:31:32,200 --> 00:31:35,720
 Daechi Chase, Free Teacher-Pupil Lecture 

427
00:31:35,720 --> 00:31:40,170
 Teacher-Pupil Tag Team 

428
00:31:46,210 --> 00:31:48,460
Yes, come on in.

429
00:31:52,740 --> 00:31:55,470
The man of the hour.

430
00:31:55,470 --> 00:31:57,420
Not quite yet, but thank you.

431
00:31:57,420 --> 00:31:58,880
You must've prepared thoroughly, right?

432
00:31:58,880 --> 00:32:00,980
Yes. You won't have to worry.

433
00:32:00,980 --> 00:32:02,570
Nice, nice.

434
00:32:02,570 --> 00:32:04,560
I'm looking forward to it.

435
00:32:04,560 --> 00:32:06,150
- It's the main lecture room, right?
 - Yes.

436
00:32:06,150 --> 00:32:08,460
Wait downstairs. I'll be there.

437
00:32:08,460 --> 00:32:10,420
Where's Team Leader Seo?

438
00:32:10,420 --> 00:32:12,000
She stopped by the conference room.

439
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:14,870
- Really? I can catch her later.
 - Okay.

440
00:32:14,870 --> 00:32:17,380
- I'll get going now, then.
 - Okay.

441
00:32:31,180 --> 00:32:34,100
You can sit in the back.

442
00:32:34,100 --> 00:32:36,040
There'll be one or two empty seats.

443
00:32:36,040 --> 00:32:39,200
Some sign up and don't show up.

444
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:43,050
Consider a joint lecture for Chanyeong High, too.

445
00:32:43,050 --> 00:32:46,480
I'm sorry I didn't think of it sooner,

446
00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:50,600
but I'd appreciate your help a lot.

447
00:32:52,950 --> 00:32:55,670
I have no ill feelings toward you.

448
00:32:55,670 --> 00:32:58,200
I hope you feel the same.

449
00:33:00,490 --> 00:33:02,570
You should get going.

450
00:33:18,650 --> 00:33:20,830
Team Leader, you came.

451
00:33:20,830 --> 00:33:23,480
You're supposed to be the main event. What's the deal?

452
00:33:23,480 --> 00:33:26,240
Team Leader, I'll be distributing the class material.

453
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:28,370
Yes, thank you.

454
00:33:35,470 --> 00:33:37,010
You're ready, right?

455
00:33:37,010 --> 00:33:40,170
Yes. We can go downstairs now.

456
00:33:40,170 --> 00:33:43,190
- We'll be right back.
 - Fighting!

457
00:33:43,190 --> 00:33:46,250
- We'll be right back.
 - Fighting.

458
00:33:47,120 --> 00:33:48,920
I'm sorry I can't attend the lecture.

459
00:33:48,920 --> 00:33:51,340
We'll come during the break.

460
00:33:51,340 --> 00:33:53,680
Hold on, hold on.

461
00:33:53,680 --> 00:33:56,550
You might get nervous or miss a beat.

462
00:33:56,550 --> 00:33:59,670
Look at me when that happens. I'll be standing in the back.

463
00:33:59,670 --> 00:34:02,970
Seeing a familiar face makes you feel at ease.

464
00:34:02,970 --> 00:34:06,350
I'm a bit excited, but I've never felt better.

465
00:34:06,350 --> 00:34:08,710
I think you're the one who's nervous.

466
00:34:09,460 --> 00:34:11,390
Yes, a little.

467
00:34:14,790 --> 00:34:17,190
The unforgettable memory of victory.

468
00:34:19,140 --> 00:34:20,890
Let's make one.

469
00:34:21,730 --> 00:34:23,880
- Let's go.
 - Okay.

470
00:34:27,940 --> 00:34:31,470
 Teacher-Pupil Tag Team 

471
00:34:33,820 --> 00:34:35,800
 Huiwon High Free Lecture 

472
00:34:35,800 --> 00:34:37,540
Let's go in.

473
00:34:45,180 --> 00:34:46,360
Thank you so much.

474
00:34:46,360 --> 00:34:48,100
Don't mention it.

475
00:34:48,100 --> 00:34:50,220
I can't wait for the lecture.

476
00:34:50,220 --> 00:34:52,080
I'm so excited.

477
00:34:52,080 --> 00:34:54,610
You won't be disappointed.

478
00:34:56,360 --> 00:34:58,590
♫   And I'm chasing all my dreams   ♫

479
00:34:58,590 --> 00:35:01,720
♫   The sound of speed   ♫

480
00:35:01,720 --> 00:35:04,980
Hit it. Hit it. In the front. In the front.

481
00:35:04,980 --> 00:35:06,690
You can't be on the side, I said.

482
00:35:06,690 --> 00:35:09,200
I'm dead.

483
00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:10,820
How rude.

484
00:35:10,820 --> 00:35:13,760
It's been an hour. We need to go to the lecture.

485
00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:16,130
I was doing amazing, but you screwed me up.

486
00:35:16,130 --> 00:35:19,240
Hurry, hurry. We need to go to the lecture.

487
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:24,910
You'd better listen to me.

488
00:35:24,910 --> 00:35:29,020
 It's Study Cafe 

489
00:35:31,960 --> 00:35:37,980
 The one who studies never fails.   

490
00:35:40,980 --> 00:35:43,620
♫  Chase me down the hall  ♫

491
00:35:43,620 --> 00:35:45,920
♫  Then never answering my call  ♫

492
00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:49,880
♫  Make me feel small I don't understand   ♫

493
00:35:49,880 --> 00:35:51,550
♫  What I gotta do  ♫

494
00:35:51,550 --> 00:35:54,900
- You'll go to the Korean lecture, right?
 - Yes.

495
00:35:54,900 --> 00:36:00,790
♫  When worlds collide, it feels that I  ♫

496
00:36:00,790 --> 00:36:04,500
♫   Don't want to try and ever love again  ♫

497
00:36:04,500 --> 00:36:07,530
♫  If you're gonna forget me  ♫

498
00:36:07,530 --> 00:36:10,270
♫  Then you gotta set me free  ♫

499
00:36:10,270 --> 00:36:12,240
♫  You think you'll always regret me.  ♫

500
00:36:12,240 --> 00:36:16,780
♫  Can you catch me?  ♫

501
00:36:19,860 --> 00:36:20,920
♫  Can you catch me?  ♫

502
00:36:20,920 --> 00:36:24,090
Assistant Director, it's time to go. Shall we go together?

503
00:36:24,090 --> 00:36:27,650
Yes, let's go together.

504
00:36:53,990 --> 00:36:55,750
Team Leader.

505
00:36:57,160 --> 00:36:58,940
It's not time yet.

506
00:36:58,940 --> 00:37:02,950
I was never early for a class because I didn't want to study.

507
00:37:02,950 --> 00:37:05,660
But still, there isn't a single person.

508
00:37:07,880 --> 00:37:10,550
I'll check outside.

509
00:37:16,650 --> 00:37:19,480
Are you sure the announcement texts were sent correctly?

510
00:37:19,480 --> 00:37:21,420
Maybe it said it was next week or—

511
00:37:21,420 --> 00:37:23,540
I checked multiple times.

512
00:37:24,790 --> 00:37:27,560
Ms. Seo, you're bleeding.

513
00:37:28,820 --> 00:37:31,020
- A tissue...
 - Just one moment.

514
00:37:39,290 --> 00:37:43,480
 Teacher-Pupil Tag Team 

515
00:37:48,230 --> 00:37:50,670
 Daechi-Chase 

516
00:37:54,530 --> 00:37:58,050
The final schedule hasn't even come out. Why the supplementary class?

517
00:37:58,050 --> 00:37:59,910
I don't know.

518
00:37:59,910 --> 00:38:01,820
I wanted to go to that thing. What's it called?

519
00:38:01,820 --> 00:38:04,900
- Teacher-Pupil Tag Team?
 - Me, too.

520
00:38:04,900 --> 00:38:06,870
Hello.

521
00:38:07,710 --> 00:38:09,970
 Teacher- Pupil Tag Team 

522
00:38:23,280 --> 00:38:25,590
The attendance rate is 99%.

523
00:38:25,590 --> 00:38:27,760
They have the right attitude.

524
00:38:28,480 --> 00:38:32,560
Seo Hye Jin's lecture will fail.

525
00:38:33,340 --> 00:38:38,010
Poor thing. I'm sure she prepared a lot.

526
00:39:06,600 --> 00:39:09,200
What happened?

527
00:39:09,200 --> 00:39:15,800
Didn't you say it'd be first come, first serve because too many people enrolled?

528
00:39:15,800 --> 00:39:16,880
I'll find out what's going on.

529
00:39:16,880 --> 00:39:19,790
I-I'll look into it.

530
00:39:21,870 --> 00:39:24,630
Are you sure you made the announcement correctly?

531
00:39:31,220 --> 00:39:32,850
Well...

532
00:39:36,880 --> 00:39:41,510
Hello, there's a free lecture here today, right?

533
00:39:59,880 --> 00:40:01,710
Is this the room?

534
00:40:02,720 --> 00:40:06,260
Yes, it is. But...

535
00:40:11,320 --> 00:40:13,790
Shouldn't you be attending the lecture?

536
00:40:13,790 --> 00:40:15,710
Don't they need a TA?

537
00:40:15,710 --> 00:40:18,010
It's not that.

538
00:40:18,010 --> 00:40:19,710
What is it?

539
00:40:23,570 --> 00:40:26,860
I think the Teacher-Pupil Tag Team failed.

540
00:40:36,420 --> 00:40:38,360
Did the lecture start already?

541
00:40:38,360 --> 00:40:41,550
I was about to check how many students came.

542
00:40:43,900 --> 00:40:46,520
The lecture isn't happening.

543
00:40:46,520 --> 00:40:47,960
Pardon?

544
00:40:54,300 --> 00:40:57,100
Will there be no lecture?

545
00:41:02,020 --> 00:41:03,640
Hold on.

546
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:12,380
Ms. Seo, are you okay?

547
00:41:12,380 --> 00:41:14,780
No, I'm not okay.

548
00:41:14,780 --> 00:41:16,950
You can cheer up, right?

549
00:41:19,140 --> 00:41:20,920
Ms. Seo.

550
00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:25,900
Yes, I'm sorry.

551
00:41:25,900 --> 00:41:28,090
Well...

552
00:41:28,090 --> 00:41:29,400
First of all...

553
00:41:29,400 --> 00:41:32,950
Please tell the student inside that we apologize.

554
00:41:32,950 --> 00:41:34,740
And...

555
00:41:34,740 --> 00:41:37,190
tell him he can keep the handout.

556
00:41:38,970 --> 00:41:43,310
Tell him to have a look since we worked hard on it. And...

557
00:41:43,310 --> 00:41:47,110
Wait, what are you talking about?

558
00:41:48,050 --> 00:41:50,170
I'll give the lecture.

559
00:41:51,220 --> 00:41:55,380
He came to take our lecture.

560
00:41:55,380 --> 00:41:59,280
I'm shocked, but I think we should. I mean

561
00:41:59,280 --> 00:42:00,960
we have to.

562
00:42:13,590 --> 00:42:15,140
 Director's Office 

563
00:42:16,560 --> 00:42:18,520
I found out.

564
00:42:18,520 --> 00:42:20,340
Special lecture?

565
00:42:20,340 --> 00:42:21,900
Yes.

566
00:42:21,900 --> 00:42:26,260
They promised a new textbook and handout only to the Choeseon Korean lecture attendees.

567
00:42:26,260 --> 00:42:29,080
They made the announcement abruptly, apparently.

568
00:42:33,020 --> 00:42:34,750
Wow.

569
00:42:34,750 --> 00:42:39,620
Hwang Sang, who wrote "Imsulgi" and Dasan Jeong Yak Yong,

570
00:42:39,620 --> 00:42:43,250
were known for their special teacher-pupil relationship.

571
00:42:43,250 --> 00:42:47,360
But Hwang Sang couldn't take a government position since he was middle-class,

572
00:42:47,360 --> 00:42:51,300
and he wrote poems in a remote village his whole life.

573
00:42:51,300 --> 00:42:56,630
Jeong Yak Yong also was exiled for 18 years.

574
00:42:56,630 --> 00:43:00,890
The affection and bond between them might be seen as

575
00:43:00,890 --> 00:43:06,800
some sort of a moral victory now.

576
00:43:06,800 --> 00:43:11,210
But the school teachers love this piece.

577
00:43:11,210 --> 00:43:14,610
Open the class material.

578
00:43:16,180 --> 00:43:18,160
Why did she choose "Imsulgi"?

579
00:43:18,160 --> 00:43:20,890
That's why you're forever in Level 5.

580
00:43:20,890 --> 00:43:23,590
Come on. I'm asking a question.

581
00:43:23,590 --> 00:43:27,340
She's saying a beautiful teacher-pupil relationship is just a moral victory.

582
00:43:28,950 --> 00:43:31,140
She's openly mocking them.

583
00:43:46,420 --> 00:43:48,370
Why don't you...

584
00:43:49,170 --> 00:43:51,410
grab a drink with me like in the old days?

585
00:43:52,700 --> 00:43:56,200
Seeing those two teachers now would make them feel uncomfortable.

586
00:44:10,730 --> 00:44:14,300
Let's just go home now.

587
00:44:15,390 --> 00:44:17,300
That's wise.

588
00:44:17,300 --> 00:44:20,770
They'll feel embarrassed if we surround them afterward.

589
00:44:20,770 --> 00:44:24,020
I don't even know what to tell them.

590
00:44:24,020 --> 00:44:25,680
I'll run away.

591
00:44:39,300 --> 00:44:41,450
An hour would be enough, right?

592
00:44:42,910 --> 00:44:46,270
- What do you mean?
 - While I'm doing the first part,

593
00:44:46,270 --> 00:44:47,930
get your act together.

594
00:44:47,930 --> 00:44:50,750
You need to do your part.

595
00:44:51,860 --> 00:44:53,510
Okay?

596
00:44:59,100 --> 00:45:04,490
 Ms. Seo, I'll create another highlight in your life for you. 

597
00:45:05,970 --> 00:45:07,690
 You're cool, Ms. Seo. 

598
00:45:07,690 --> 00:45:12,890
 Teachers hold a special place in one's heart. 

599
00:45:21,900 --> 00:45:24,530
- I'll go in now.
 - Hold on.

600
00:45:27,420 --> 00:45:29,140
I'll do it.

601
00:45:30,140 --> 00:45:31,980
Teaching one student...

602
00:45:33,100 --> 00:45:35,220
is my specialty.

603
00:45:37,190 --> 00:45:38,950
Just one student.

604
00:45:41,110 --> 00:45:44,050
No one can teach him better than me.

605
00:45:44,050 --> 00:45:46,470
You're here as proof of that.

606
00:45:57,250 --> 00:46:00,350
Gosh, I must be such a mess.

607
00:46:01,150 --> 00:46:02,860
Not at all.

608
00:46:04,830 --> 00:46:06,270
Do I look okay?

609
00:46:06,270 --> 00:46:08,190
You'd make me faint.

610
00:46:08,190 --> 00:46:09,380
It's okay to switch the order, right?

611
00:46:09,380 --> 00:46:10,820
Of course.

612
00:46:10,820 --> 00:46:13,610
I memorized it enough to dream about it.

613
00:46:13,610 --> 00:46:15,290
Let's go in.

614
00:46:24,890 --> 00:46:26,780
Nice to meet you.

615
00:46:28,060 --> 00:46:30,510
And thank you for waiting.

616
00:46:32,050 --> 00:46:37,300
The lecture better be impressive since we took your precious time, right?

617
00:46:37,300 --> 00:46:39,990
Today, we'll...

618
00:46:40,750 --> 00:46:43,180
learn a piece from...

619
00:46:43,180 --> 00:46:48,600
 Camera and... 

620
00:46:59,530 --> 00:47:05,760
Well, do you mind me asking your name first?

621
00:47:05,760 --> 00:47:08,280
I'm Lee Si Wu.

622
00:47:08,280 --> 00:47:10,000
Thank you.

623
00:47:18,060 --> 00:47:22,190
Si Wu, do you know Park Wan Seo?

624
00:47:23,730 --> 00:47:25,400
I do.

625
00:47:25,400 --> 00:47:28,380
You've read her pieces outside the textbook, too?

626
00:47:28,380 --> 00:47:31,080
Yes, a few.

627
00:47:31,080 --> 00:47:33,800
Wow, we have an impressive student.

628
00:47:33,800 --> 00:47:35,900
Okay.

629
00:47:35,900 --> 00:47:39,770
We'll examine "Camera and Boot" from the textbook today.

630
00:47:39,770 --> 00:47:41,810
But before that,

631
00:47:41,810 --> 00:47:45,650
I'll tell you about Park Wan Seo's life.

632
00:47:45,650 --> 00:47:48,180
Put the pen down. Don't take notes.

633
00:47:51,830 --> 00:47:56,080
Park Wan Seo didn't want her work to be

634
00:47:56,080 --> 00:48:00,690
included in textbooks or exams when she was alive.

635
00:48:01,780 --> 00:48:07,370
But ironically, her work is on exams all the time.

636
00:48:07,370 --> 00:48:08,940
You know, right?

637
00:48:11,110 --> 00:48:14,320
"Tree," "Winter Outing," "For the Dead Birds,"

638
00:48:14,320 --> 00:48:17,190
"Bicycle Thief," and "Psychedelic Butterfly."

639
00:48:17,190 --> 00:48:21,500
You'll come across countless pieces by her from now on.

640
00:48:21,500 --> 00:48:24,610
To put it simply, the adults around you

641
00:48:24,610 --> 00:48:29,950
are dying to make you read her work.

642
00:48:29,950 --> 00:48:31,940
Why?

643
00:48:31,940 --> 00:48:33,620
Why would that be?

644
00:48:35,760 --> 00:48:41,600
 Park Wan Seo. 1931-2011 

645
00:48:46,890 --> 00:48:48,040
 Park Wan Seo. 1931-2011 

646
00:48:48,040 --> 00:48:52,480
Here. I think the answer is in these numbers.

647
00:48:52,480 --> 00:48:58,560
First of all, you can tell she must've experienced a few major historic events.

648
00:49:00,930 --> 00:49:04,770
 Independence, the war... 

649
00:49:08,330 --> 00:49:10,390
- and the internet?
 - Excellent.

650
00:49:10,390 --> 00:49:14,020
To make it sound impressive, it's the war and the wound from the national division.

651
00:49:14,020 --> 00:49:15,980
And industrialization.

652
00:49:15,980 --> 00:49:20,620
Injustice and social ills brought by the changes

653
00:49:20,620 --> 00:49:22,580
became her topics.

654
00:49:22,580 --> 00:49:24,130
One more thing.

655
00:49:24,130 --> 00:49:28,970
Her mother, who greatly influenced her throughout her childhood.

656
00:49:29,870 --> 00:49:31,500
What do you say?

657
00:49:31,500 --> 00:49:34,170
Do you see why she's the go-to author in exams?

658
00:49:35,790 --> 00:49:39,950
So, if you deeply understand her life,

659
00:49:39,950 --> 00:49:44,210
you won't be afraid no matter which piece of her work you encounter.

660
00:49:44,210 --> 00:49:46,690
Even if you're reading it for the first time.

661
00:49:47,910 --> 00:49:52,370
Her father passed away when she was three.

662
00:49:52,370 --> 00:49:56,720
The cause of death was appendicitis.

663
00:49:56,720 --> 00:50:02,020
It was during the Japanese occupation, but you could've treated appendicitis at hospitals.

664
00:50:02,020 --> 00:50:04,720
Why do you think that happened, then?

665
00:50:06,920 --> 00:50:09,720
She mentions this in her old interviews.

666
00:50:09,720 --> 00:50:11,680
"We gave him acupuncture needles and fumbled around

667
00:50:11,680 --> 00:50:16,500
and by the time he arrived downtown on a cart, it was too late."

668
00:50:19,460 --> 00:50:22,860
Who do you think was most shocked by that?

669
00:50:25,420 --> 00:50:28,170
- The wife?
 - Bingo, the father's wife.

670
00:50:28,170 --> 00:50:30,780
So, Park's mother.

671
00:50:30,780 --> 00:50:34,700
It's impossible not to mention her mother when you talk about her.

672
00:50:34,700 --> 00:50:37,940
She has always been passionate about education,

673
00:50:37,940 --> 00:50:45,170
but this incident gives her a strong desire to give her children a modern education.

674
00:50:45,170 --> 00:50:49,380
Park was learning the Thousand Character Classic from her grandfather.

675
00:50:49,380 --> 00:50:54,250
But her mother said, "That's not education. It's just a cute trick."

676
00:50:54,250 --> 00:50:58,190
And she turned the house upside down.

677
00:51:00,850 --> 00:51:03,400
You just thought of someone, didn't you?

678
00:51:03,400 --> 00:51:07,710
Doesn't that remind you of the protagonist's mother

679
00:51:07,710 --> 00:51:11,100
from "Camera and Boot," the piece we'll study today?

680
00:51:14,200 --> 00:51:16,000
Nice to meet you, Jun Ho.

681
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:19,380
Come on in.

00:52:21,930 --> 00:52:28,170
Do you know what the camera and boot symbolize?

691
00:52:28,170 --> 00:52:29,990
- Yes.
 - What are they?

692
00:52:29,990 --> 00:52:34,880
The camera is the ideal world, and the boot is the reality.

693
00:52:34,880 --> 00:52:36,700
Impressive.

694
00:52:36,700 --> 00:52:38,900

00:53:28,180 --> 00:53:29,820
Hun.

702
00:53:31,610 --> 00:53:32,960
You probably don't know this.

703
00:53:32,960 --> 00:53:37,110
With "I," the symbolic theme...

723
00:55:29,860 --> 00:55:32,520
 To understand King Sejong's Hunminjeongeum properly, 

724
00:55:32,520 --> 00:55:37,630
you need to clearly understand the basics of medieval Korean first, okay?

725
00:55:37,630 --> 00:55:39,180
Let's learn about the principles of the production of the characters.

726
00:55:39,180 --> 00:55:41,320
Hunminjeongeum's production principles are...

727
00:55:41,320 --> 00:55:44,690
Hieroglyphics, addition of lines, and independent consonants.

728
00:55:46,390 --> 00:55:49,620
You could respond automatically about these things, huh?

729
00:55:50,980 --> 00:55:53,500
- What year was it created? 
- 1443.

730
00:55:53,500 --> 00:55:56,360
It was released in 1446.

731
00:55:57,630 --> 00:55:59,410
Hey,

732
00:55:59,410 --> 00:56:04,130
I just understood how Jeong Yak Yong must've felt when he met Hwang Sang.

733
00:56:04,130 --> 00:56:05,400
Geez.

734
00:56:05,400 --> 00:56:07,060
Let's look at the creation principles.

735
00:56:07,060 --> 00:56:11,570
Let's look at them in initial, middle, and finishing consonants.

736
00:56:11,570 --> 00:56:14,300
Let's start with the initial consonants.

737
00:56:14,300 --> 00:56:17,940
The principles of initial consonants are...

738
00:56:17,940 --> 00:56:22,800
hieroglyphic principles and...

739
00:56:22,800 --> 00:56:26,810
the other one is the addition of lines.

740
00:56:47,040 --> 00:56:50,460
That was the preview lecture we prepared.

741
00:56:50,460 --> 00:56:52,920
Did you find it helpful?

742
00:56:52,920 --> 00:56:55,380
- Yes.
 - The enrollment starts next Wednesday.

743
00:56:55,380 --> 00:56:58,940
Learn about the curriculum and price on the website.

744
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:37,100
 Up to now, teaching of Korean has not been the best ("Choeseon"). 

745
00:58:25,120 --> 00:58:27,330
 Ms. Seo, I'm going home now. 

746
00:58:27,330 --> 00:58:31,080
 Cheer up. Fighting. Min Ji. 

747
00:58:39,020 --> 00:58:41,230
Wow...

748
00:58:41,230 --> 00:58:44,400
I'm getting tons of pity messages.

749
00:58:45,710 --> 00:58:47,610
You haven't gone home yet?

750
00:58:47,610 --> 00:58:49,090
No.

751
00:59:06,090 --> 00:59:07,610
What's this?

752
00:59:07,610 --> 00:59:11,870
I always get so hungry after a lecture.

753
00:59:17,310 --> 00:59:19,680
I'm sorry. Thank you...

754
00:59:19,680 --> 00:59:22,500
Excuse me. Sorry.

755
00:59:29,130 --> 00:59:31,060
What's going on?

756
00:59:31,060 --> 00:59:35,830
You didn't forget our plan because you were so wrapped up in your excitement, right?

757
00:59:35,830 --> 00:59:38,560
We already prepared a spread to celebrate.

758
00:59:38,560 --> 00:59:40,540
Are you not coming?

759
00:59:42,620 --> 00:59:44,310
Anything for me?

760
00:59:45,450 --> 00:59:48,550
It's nothing fancy, anyway.

761
00:59:48,550 --> 00:59:50,080
You have something.

762
00:59:51,120 --> 00:59:53,720
Well, let me see.

763
00:59:53,720 --> 00:59:55,880
- Well... 
- What did you get?

764
00:59:55,880 --> 00:59:57,730
Let's go.

765
00:59:58,680 --> 01:00:03,870
It failed, but it was still an event. We need to have an afterparty.

766
01:00:04,880 --> 01:00:06,450
Let's go.

767
01:00:26,970 --> 01:00:32,970
 Imgyeong Villa 

768
01:01:04,950 --> 01:01:07,030
 High School Math 

769
01:01:11,440 --> 01:01:13,830
Gosh, here she is. Finally.

770
01:01:13,830 --> 01:01:16,890
Gosh, well done.

771
01:01:16,890 --> 01:01:18,270
Welcome.

772
01:01:18,270 --> 01:01:20,840
Did it go well? Was it amazing?

773
01:01:20,840 --> 01:01:22,720
Did you seduce everyone?

774
01:01:24,680 --> 01:01:26,160
Let's go.

775
01:01:28,380 --> 01:01:31,670
What kind of psycho is that?

776
01:01:31,670 --> 01:01:33,150
She's not a psycho.

777
01:01:33,150 --> 01:01:37,590
Anyone would do that to secure their students.

778
01:01:37,590 --> 01:01:39,900
I just let my guard down.

779
01:01:42,190 --> 01:01:43,860
It hurts.

780
01:01:49,150 --> 01:01:54,540
 Choeeon Korean Group Chat (No TAs) 

781
01:02:03,550 --> 01:02:05,240
 I'm back. 

782
01:02:05,240 --> 01:02:08,600
 The supplementary lecture was so lame. 

783
01:02:10,240 --> 01:02:13,710
 Was it worth betraying Choeseon for? 

784
01:02:13,710 --> 01:02:15,970
 Hurry up and tell me, Lee Si Wu. 

785
01:02:24,230 --> 01:02:27,440
 I think I'll switch. It was pretty good. 

786
01:02:27,440 --> 01:02:30,090
 That's insane. Was it that good? 

787
01:02:30,090 --> 01:02:32,850
 If Si Wu is going there, that changes things. 

788
01:02:32,850 --> 01:02:36,020
 Whoa, is the top of the class betraying us? 

789
01:02:39,040 --> 01:02:47,940


790
01:03:02,140 --> 01:03:06,280
 The Midnight Romance in Hagwon 

791
01:03:06,280 --> 01:03:10,490
 Ms. Seo, take it easy and work for the Gangbuk branch opening task force. 

792
01:03:10,490 --> 01:03:13,710
 There's no such a thing. They want me to leave empty-handed. 

793
01:03:13,710 --> 01:03:15,690
 Shouldn't you complain or something? 

794
01:03:15,690 --> 01:03:17,970
 You mean you're screwed because of me? 

795
01:03:17,970 --> 01:03:20,550
 It was fun? 

796
01:03:20,550 --> 01:03:21,730
 Hey, Lee Si Wu! 

797
01:03:21,730 --> 01:03:25,690
 My teaching method was too conventional. So I prepared something. 

798
01:03:25,690 --> 01:03:27,800
 Don't look at me like that. I won't go down easily. 

799
01:03:27,800 --> 01:03:30,220
 Did you sign a contract for next year? 

800
01:03:30,220 --> 01:03:33,560
 Why don't you sign one with me instead? 

801
01:03:33,560 --> 01:03:38,060
♫  Can you catch me?  ♫
