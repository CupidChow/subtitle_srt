[reporter] Controversy is brewing
over a deceased man in his twenties

3
00:00:14,472 --> 00:00:17,475
who was writing the autobiography
of a famous serial killer.

4
00:00:17,559 --> 00:00:20,687
Mr. Kim hanged himself
in his small studio apartment in Seoul.

5
00:00:21,271 --> 00:00:24,024
He posted on an online message board
before his death,

6
00:00:24,107 --> 00:00:26,151
saying that he was
ghostwriting an autobiography

7
00:00:26,234 --> 00:00:27,819
of the murderer Ji Hyang-cheol.

8
00:00:28,570 --> 00:00:30,572
Ji Hyang-cheol is
a notorious serial killer

9
00:00:30,655 --> 00:00:32,032
who was sentenced to death

10
00:00:32,115 --> 00:00:34,617
for murdering eight women
in the early 2000s.

11
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:37,245
Police stated
that they did not find any evidence

12
00:00:37,328 --> 00:00:40,081
linking Ji, who is currently incarcerated,

13
00:00:40,165 --> 00:00:41,958
to the alleged autobiography

00:00:42,042 --> 00:00:45,003

00:00:58,683 --> 00:00:59,976
does it make a sound?

20
00:01:01,102 --> 00:01:02,479
Or is there nothing…

00:01:07,776 --> 00:01:08,902

So I heard you were the one

00:02:09,546 --> 00:02:10,380
Not true.

29
00:02:10,463 --> 00:02:11,840
Detective Cho said that.

30
00:02:15,468 --> 00:02:17,011
Seriously, how'd you know?

You're good at catching criminals

When I see the faces of violent criminals,
I just say to myself,

"Really? That's who did it?"

34
00:02:26,312 --> 00:02:27,522
But how do you know?

35
00:02:27,605 --> 00:02:30,400
Is it the way they talk? Their behaviors?

36
00:02:32,193 --> 00:02:34,696
Does it have to do with
the nickname they gave you?

I should've picked you up.

Ugh, I get it. I'm sore everywhere too.

Well, I threw it all out.

You're able to live carefree now.

[Yeong-ha] Get out.

77
00:06:16,959 --> 00:06:19,379
There's nothing I can do
at this point anyway.

I couldn't care less anymore.

I promise you

80
00:06:26,677 --> 00:06:29,263
I'll keep my mouth shut about it.
Now get out.

00:07:26,779 --> 00:07:29,449
how you could possibly need this house

93
00:07:29,949 --> 00:07:31,242
more than I do.

94
00:07:31,742 --> 00:07:32,785
Tell me.

95
00:07:33,870 --> 00:07:35,121
There has to be a reason

96
00:07:35,204 --> 00:07:37,206
that you need this entire place
just for you.

100
00:07:44,547 --> 00:07:45,923
take a look around.

101

Doesn't this look like my house?

102
00:07:54,682 --> 00:07:56,767
You just lived here before I did.

103
00:07:59,145 --> 00:08:02,190

it should be yours forever, does it?

And now

109
00:08:38,851 --> 00:08:41,604
what started as a battle
for evidence and the truth

110
00:08:42,980 --> 00:08:46,317
became a turf war
led by that psycho woman.

111
00:08:47,151 --> 00:08:49,362
[pharmacist] You're experiencing pain
due to the accident.

112
00:08:49,445 --> 00:08:52,615
So we'll prescribe you

This year is flying by, isn't it?

[officer 2] That's how things are
when you're doing fieldwork.

I'll be done soon, I think.

I don't really wanna advertise it.

Ah. I wasn't thinking. Sorry.

00:10:56,113 --> 00:10:59,075
Mm, actually, forget it.

[Choi] So the owner hasn't been
picking up your calls,

and you arrived
to find that woman staying here.

160

Excuse me, were you in that accident
in front of the police station?

[automated voice] The person
you are trying to reach is unavailable.

He wouldn't go far,
not after accepting a booking.

175

I imagine you have to get going.
Must be busy here.

Do you

177
00:14:12,852 --> 00:14:15,771
really have nothing
to show your, um, booking,

178
00:14:15,855 --> 00:14:17,356
like a deposit or something?

179
00:14:19,525 --> 00:14:23,195
There's no website, so when I got here,
he told me I could pay in cash.

180
00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:24,947
I told the, ah…

181
00:14:26,073 --> 00:14:28,325
I forgot the name of the other guy.

185
00:14:37,543 --> 00:14:38,919
Any texts?

186
00:14:39,003 --> 00:14:41,005
When you book, don't you exchange texts?

187
00:14:41,088 --> 00:14:44,592
Uh, you'd need to communicate somehow, no?

188
00:14:45,259 --> 00:14:46,635
My texts get deleted.

189
00:14:49,221 --> 00:14:50,306
[scoffs]

190
00:14:50,389 --> 00:14:54,476
Why are you asking me all these questions?
Do you think I'm trespassing right now?

191
00:14:55,561 --> 00:14:59,106
You know, it must be tricky for you 'cause

192
00:14:59,982 --> 00:15:01,025
you're by yourself.

193
00:15:01,734 --> 00:15:02,776
[chuckles]

194
00:15:03,903 --> 00:15:05,654
You can't talk to me like that.

[footsteps approaching]

196
00:15:10,993 --> 00:15:11,827

trying to reach is currently unavailable.

Please leave a message after the tone.

203
00:15:36,226 --> 00:15:39,939
[man 1] Ah, hello, sir.
I'm so glad I finally got through to you.

204
00:15:40,648 --> 00:15:43,525
Yeah, I was a bit shocked at first, but…

205
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:48,072
Oh, she's a live-in employee?

[children laugh]

217
00:16:15,224 --> 00:16:16,642
[man 1] Give me some meat too.

218
00:16:16,725 --> 00:16:18,102
[woman 1] Give him one of those.

Hello, ma'am.

227
00:17:24,626 --> 00:17:25,669
How have you been?

228
00:17:29,256 --> 00:17:31,133
My grandma, do you know where she is?

231
00:17:43,479 --> 00:17:47,066
The flowers your son sent have wilted.
May I throw them out?

[grunts]

233
00:17:59,745 --> 00:18:00,829
[Gi-ho] Go back to sleep.

234
00:18:25,145 --> 00:18:26,021
[Jong-du] Oh, hey.

00:18:26,522 --> 00:18:28,482

[man 1] Oh, hi!
Are you the one I spoke with?

239
00:18:57,594 --> 00:18:59,346
-[man 2] Ah, yes. Hello.
-[man 1] Here you go.

240
00:18:59,429 --> 00:19:01,807
-[man 2] Did you enjoy your stay?
-Yes, it was brilliant.

241
00:19:01,890 --> 00:19:03,809
[man 2] Great!
I hope you didn't have any issues.

242
00:19:03,892 --> 00:19:06,770
-It was perfect.
-Oh! What are you doing?

243
00:19:06,854 --> 00:19:08,772
-Who are you to be taking the keys?
-What?

244
00:19:08,856 --> 00:19:11,859
[man 1] Oh, don't worry about her.
She apparently works here.

245
00:19:11,942 --> 00:19:13,902
-I'm sorry?
-Who are you?

246
00:19:13,986 --> 00:19:16,238
I'm here because the owner asked me

247
00:19:16,321 --> 00:19:18,157
to handle all the cleaning
and laundry here.

248
00:19:22,953 --> 00:19:24,037
[gasps]

249
00:19:24,121 --> 00:19:25,497

-Huh?

250
00:19:25,581 --> 00:19:28,500
[laughs] My God! Oh my God!

251
00:19:29,168 --> 00:19:31,837
You forgot, didn't you? [laughs]

252
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:33,213
[man 1] Do you know this woman?

253
00:19:34,298 --> 00:19:35,257
[man 2] I don't.

254
00:19:36,175 --> 00:19:37,342
I would remember her.

255
00:19:37,426 --> 00:19:40,012
[man 1] She's a strange woman.
Just ignore her.

256
00:19:40,512 --> 00:19:41,805
[man 2] Oh.

257
00:19:41,889 --> 00:19:43,056
I'll just take that.

258
00:19:43,140 --> 00:19:45,184
Seriously, stop it. Jeez.

259
00:19:45,684 --> 00:19:47,895
-Take care. Have a safe trip home.
-[man 1] Thank you.

260
00:19:47,978 --> 00:19:49,771
-This is bullshit.
-[man 2] Come back soon!

261
00:19:49,855 --> 00:19:51,273
-[man 1] Thanks!
-[man 2] Wonderful!

262
00:20:00,449 --> 00:20:01,575
Leave me alone.

263
00:20:04,786 --> 00:20:06,246
What are you doing? [grunts]

264
00:20:06,330 --> 00:20:07,873
You're crazy! Stop it!

265
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,710
[Yong-chae] An obnoxious guest?

266
00:20:12,377 --> 00:20:15,130
Well, just tell them off
if they break your rules.

267
00:20:16,089 --> 00:20:18,926
If they don't stop,
you must call the police.

268
00:20:20,719 --> 00:20:21,637
Hmm.

269
00:20:22,971 --> 00:20:23,931
You think so?

270
00:20:27,559 --> 00:20:30,687
[Yong-chae] Having a guest like that
could cause huge problems for any job.

271
00:20:30,771 --> 00:20:32,105
You can never let 'em win.

272
00:20:32,189 --> 00:20:33,148
[sighs]

273
00:20:34,733 --> 00:20:36,568
Gambling, drinking, or drugs.

274
00:20:36,652 --> 00:20:39,321
I'd report them
if they're doing anything illegal.

275
00:20:41,990 --> 00:20:43,742
What if the police can't help?

276
00:20:44,660 --> 00:20:47,371
[Yong-chae] Well, sometimes,
the problem may be irritating,

277
00:20:47,454 --> 00:20:49,998
but legally, it's not worth reporting.

278
00:20:50,082 --> 00:20:54,336
In that case, the only thing you can do
is wait for them to leave.

279
00:21:00,217 --> 00:21:02,552
-And if they won't?
-[Yong-chae] Won't leave?

280

[Yong-chae laughs]

281
00:21:05,264 --> 00:21:08,100
Why wouldn't they?
Everyone has to go home eventually.

282
00:21:09,559 --> 00:21:12,854
They all need to leave
once it's checkout time

283
00:21:12,938 --> 00:21:16,066
so that the next booking is able to enjoy.

284

spare toothbrushes in the bathroom

316
00:23:26,530 --> 00:23:28,740
and that the auntie here could help me.

317

Who said?

318
00:23:31,618 --> 00:23:33,703

Who are you calling "auntie"?

Can I get two toothbrushes?

-Bring me all your IDs, please.
-We're all mature adults.

330

Then prove it.

331
00:24:30,260 --> 00:24:31,344
Or should I call the police?

And what happens when you call them, huh?

335
00:24:38,727 --> 00:24:41,062
Huh? They'll shut
the whole place down, won't they?

336
00:24:41,771 --> 00:24:42,981
Shut this place down?

337

00:25:59,724 --> 00:26:01,726
-Where are you?
-[Yeong-ha] You still haven't left?

357
00:26:01,810 --> 00:26:03,895
You're pulling tricks
and hiding out, are you?

358
00:26:05,438 --> 00:26:06,773
[Yeong-ha sighs]

359
00:26:06,856 --> 00:26:07,816
What tricks?

360
00:26:09,317 --> 00:26:12,654
What's strange about having guests?
It's a vacation rental.

361
00:26:13,780 --> 00:26:16,616
And anyways,
you're being the strange one here.

362
00:26:16,700 --> 00:26:18,743
[stirring music playing]

363
00:26:18,827 --> 00:26:21,997
[sighs] Come back,
and let's talk this out.

364
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:23,456
[Yeong-ha] More guests are coming.

365
00:26:23,540 --> 00:26:27,210
A lot of large groups have booked.
It is vacation season.

366
00:26:27,294 --> 00:26:28,962
You're not helping yourself, you know?

367
00:26:29,045 --> 00:26:33,466
And can you clean the place up for me?
The cleaner won't go because of you.

368
00:26:36,553 --> 00:26:38,847
[sighs] Fucking piece of shit.

369
00:26:43,268 --> 00:26:44,227
Hey, sir.

370
00:26:45,353 --> 00:26:47,272
I could kill your daughter if you'd like.

371
00:26:48,815 --> 00:26:50,025
SLIDE TO POWER OFF

372
00:26:51,484 --> 00:26:53,403
[automated voice]
The person you have dialed is--

373
00:26:55,322 --> 00:26:56,239
Damn it!

374
00:26:57,115 --> 00:26:57,991
[grunts]

375
00:26:58,074 --> 00:26:59,034
[sighs]

376
00:27:00,327 --> 00:27:01,161
[groans]

377
00:27:02,871 --> 00:27:03,872
[exhales]

378
00:27:04,998 --> 00:27:05,999
[sighs]

379
00:27:12,714 --> 00:27:14,215
[music fades]

380
00:27:28,897 --> 00:27:30,899
[mysterious music playing]

381
00:28:14,651 --> 00:28:15,694
[knocking at door]

382
00:28:20,448 --> 00:28:21,491
[door opens]

383
00:28:23,743 --> 00:28:24,828
[sighs]

384
00:28:28,873 --> 00:28:30,208
What happened to the window?

385
00:28:31,084 --> 00:28:32,085
[sighs]

386
00:28:36,214 --> 00:28:37,549
[music fades]

387
00:29:07,996 --> 00:29:09,164
[door closes]

388
00:29:11,583 --> 00:29:12,459
[machine beeps]

389
00:29:13,501 --> 00:29:15,003
[unsettling music playing]

390
00:29:15,086 --> 00:29:17,380
[detective] He was working on
Ji Hyang-cheol's autobiography

391
00:29:17,464 --> 00:29:19,215
moments before he died.

392
00:29:19,299 --> 00:29:22,469
Only one unidentified individual
was captured on CCTV

393
00:29:22,552 --> 00:29:24,304
at the presumed time of his death,

394
00:29:24,387 --> 00:29:27,140
but we don't know if he has anything to do
with that ghostwriter.

395
00:29:27,223 --> 00:29:28,057
That was a month ago.

396
00:29:38,777 --> 00:29:39,861
[Bo-min] And the autopsy?

397
00:29:39,944 --> 00:29:41,029
He hanged himself,

398
00:29:41,112 --> 00:29:43,615
so they ruled it as a suicide
and cremated him.

399
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:48,244
Detective Cho investigated everyone
who knew him but found no viable suspects.

400
00:29:48,745 --> 00:29:51,164
He even investigated people
related to the victims

401
00:29:51,247 --> 00:29:52,916
but found nothing of note.

402
00:29:52,999 --> 00:29:54,793
Are you sure he was really writing it?

403
00:29:54,876 --> 00:29:58,129
Hyang-cheol said he didn't know anything
about an autobiography,

404
00:29:58,213 --> 00:30:00,465
and the victim
never contacted any publishers.

405
00:30:01,216 --> 00:30:02,300
He could've made it up.

406
00:30:02,383 --> 00:30:04,803
That's what everyone's saying
since the news broke.

407
00:30:04,886 --> 00:30:06,721
Do you think Ji Hyang-cheol is involved?

408
00:30:06,805 --> 00:30:08,223
[detective laughs]

409
00:30:08,306 --> 00:30:10,350
I called to ask you the same thing.

410
00:30:12,268 --> 00:30:13,436
I don't know either.

411
00:30:18,066 --> 00:30:19,150
You doing all right?

412
00:30:20,068 --> 00:30:20,985
Yeah.

413
00:30:22,821 --> 00:30:24,072
You aren't bored yet?

414
00:30:38,294 --> 00:30:39,212
No.

415
00:30:39,796 --> 00:30:41,422
-[mosquitoes buzzing]
-[smacking]

416
00:30:44,259 --> 00:30:45,176

[Yeong-ha sighs]

[door closes]

420
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:10,994
-[Choi sighs]
-[grunts]

421
00:31:11,077 --> 00:31:12,662
Going on vacation, huh?

422
00:31:14,831 --> 00:31:17,750
-What are your plans?
-Don't you even think of calling.

423
00:31:17,834 --> 00:31:19,794
[Choi] You better not call me
when you're gone.

424
00:31:20,712 --> 00:31:23,172
Your uniform. You're not changing?

425
00:31:23,256 --> 00:31:25,174
There's one thing I have to do.

426
00:31:27,176 --> 00:31:28,303
[phone buzzing]

427
00:31:34,183 --> 00:31:36,269
-Hello?
-[man] Hi, are you the rental owner?

428
00:31:36,352 --> 00:31:37,520
We got here a little early,

429
00:31:37,604 --> 00:31:39,731
but the lady here
won't hand over the keys.

430
00:31:40,565 --> 00:31:41,858
I'll head right over.

431
00:31:43,067 --> 00:31:45,069
[dramatic music playing]

432
00:31:48,364 --> 00:31:50,074
[vehicle approaching]

433
00:32:09,844 --> 00:32:10,887
Give me the keys.

434
00:32:37,622 --> 00:32:38,539
Uh, sir?

435
00:32:39,999 --> 00:32:41,459
What if she gets in?

436
00:32:41,542 --> 00:32:44,545
She'd be trespassing.
Call the police right away.

437
00:32:44,629 --> 00:32:46,547
-Let me clean up quickly.
-[man] Thanks.

438
00:32:48,883 --> 00:32:50,218
[music fades]

439
00:32:51,511 --> 00:32:53,471
[officer] Good to finally see you here.

440
00:32:55,223 --> 00:32:56,808
You can leave that right here.

441
00:32:58,059 --> 00:33:00,395
Kim Seon-tae, Hosu Police Station.

442
00:33:00,478 --> 00:33:01,604
Why are you here?

443
00:33:02,897 --> 00:33:05,316
I have a reservation.
Those guys are with me.

444
00:33:08,152 --> 00:33:09,654
Turns out you were close by,

445
00:33:09,737 --> 00:33:12,740
so why did you make
that poor woman's life so hard?

446
00:33:15,493 --> 00:33:17,996
Are you harassing her and messing with her

447
00:33:18,079 --> 00:33:21,582
because she's a woman
staying at your property all by herself?

448
00:33:22,208 --> 00:33:23,418
"All by herself."

449
00:33:25,169 --> 00:33:27,171
Are you talking about that woman?

450
00:33:27,255 --> 00:33:30,341
[Seon-tae] That's unacceptable behavior.
You'll get yourself in trouble.

451
00:33:31,134 --> 00:33:32,176
Let's head in, guys.

452
00:33:34,345 --> 00:33:36,347
[stirring music playing]

453
00:33:43,396 --> 00:33:44,856
You called the police?

454
00:33:46,399 --> 00:33:47,942
The guy volunteered.

455
00:33:52,697 --> 00:33:53,781
By the way,

456
00:33:55,158 --> 00:33:56,701
you're not looking too good.

457
00:33:56,784 --> 00:33:58,119
What have you been doing?

458
00:34:04,834 --> 00:34:05,918
[door closes]

459
00:34:13,676 --> 00:34:14,594
[sighs]

460
00:34:16,387 --> 00:34:18,181
[guests] One, two, three!

461
00:34:19,390 --> 00:34:21,184
[woman] Woo-hoo!

462
00:34:22,310 --> 00:34:23,853
[men laughing]

463
00:34:30,485 --> 00:34:32,278
[woman] Wow!

464
00:34:32,361 --> 00:34:33,988
-[man 1] Whoo!
-[man 2 moans]

465
00:34:34,864 --> 00:34:36,532
-[laughs]
-Oh!

466
00:34:37,033 --> 00:34:38,534
[all exclaim]

467
00:34:38,618 --> 00:34:40,286
[laughs] Take it.

468
00:34:41,579 --> 00:34:43,081
[woman exclaims, laughs]

469
00:34:43,664 --> 00:34:46,375
-Join us in the pool.
-Oh no! Oh no! Oh no!

470
00:34:46,459 --> 00:34:48,169
-[man 2] Yeah, yeah, yeah!
-[woman screaming]

471
00:34:48,252 --> 00:34:49,295
[men laughing]

472
00:34:49,378 --> 00:34:50,797
-[man 3] Yeah!
-Hey!

473
00:34:51,506 --> 00:34:53,049
-[man 2] Oh my God.
-[woman exclaims]

474
00:34:54,467 --> 00:34:57,261
[man 1] Ah, hey, hey. You drive, okay?

475
00:34:57,345 --> 00:34:59,722
-[man 3] Are you kidding me? You drive.
-[man 1] Then you pay.

476
00:34:59,806 --> 00:35:00,848
[man 3] Okay.

477
00:35:00,932 --> 00:35:02,141
-We're off.
-[man 2] Good night.

478
00:35:02,225 --> 00:35:03,643
-See ya!
-[man 3] Have a great night.

479
00:35:03,726 --> 00:35:05,853
Thanks, guys. Get home safe.

480
00:35:09,107 --> 00:35:10,066
[Seon-tae sighs]

481
00:35:11,984 --> 00:35:14,237
-[Seon-tae] You sure you'll be okay?
-[clears throat] Sure.

482
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:16,781
Jeez! I don't know
if you're brave or naive.

483
00:35:16,864 --> 00:35:18,908
[laughs]

484
00:35:20,326 --> 00:35:22,829
Leave the bags. I'll grab them tomorrow.

485
00:35:23,538 --> 00:35:25,373
-Don't you have work?
-I'm on vacation.

486
00:35:29,168 --> 00:35:30,878
-[engine starting]
-See ya.

487
00:35:36,676 --> 00:35:38,678
[creatures chittering]

488
00:36:13,546 --> 00:36:15,590
[mysterious music playing]

489
00:36:15,673 --> 00:36:17,091
[sizzling]

490
00:36:44,493 --> 00:36:45,661
[chuckles]

491
00:36:46,954 --> 00:36:47,788
Food good?

492
00:36:49,415 --> 00:36:50,249
It's not bad.

493
00:36:53,419 --> 00:36:55,671
You owe her an apology,
don't you think, sir?

494
00:36:59,175 --> 00:37:00,551
As a police officer,

495
00:37:00,635 --> 00:37:04,055
I've met way too many men
who act more entitled as they get older.

496
00:37:04,555 --> 00:37:06,891
Guess they only have
their pride remaining.

497
00:37:08,184 --> 00:37:11,604
They all think they're in their prime.
It's truly pathetic.

498
00:37:11,687 --> 00:37:12,772
Sounds rough.

499
00:37:14,023 --> 00:37:15,775
So you're a people person?

500
00:37:17,068 --> 00:37:17,902
I think so.

501
00:37:19,695 --> 00:37:22,448
-You're good at reading people.
-[laughs]

502
00:37:22,531 --> 00:37:23,699
[music fades]

503
00:37:25,076 --> 00:37:26,285
Wine, anyone?

504
00:37:26,827 --> 00:37:29,830
Let's all forget about it
over a nice glass of wine.

505
00:37:46,264 --> 00:37:47,974
[Yeong-ha] Why'd you become an officer?

506
00:37:49,517 --> 00:37:51,227
[footsteps approaching]

507
00:38:24,010 --> 00:38:26,262
[Yeong-ha] Have you drank anything
that woman's poured you?

508
00:38:27,555 --> 00:38:29,432
I wouldn't if I were you.

509
00:38:46,490 --> 00:38:47,450
[groans]

510
00:38:49,869 --> 00:38:51,329
[breathes deeply]

511
00:38:52,371 --> 00:38:54,165
[belching]

512
00:38:54,248 --> 00:38:55,499
[groans]

513
00:38:55,583 --> 00:38:56,751
That little son of a--

514
00:39:09,764 --> 00:39:10,681
I need a toothbrush.

515
00:39:32,787 --> 00:39:35,289
[sighs] Thanks to you, mister,

516
00:39:36,415 --> 00:39:38,542
that bastard won't go home.

517
00:39:39,585 --> 00:39:41,545
-He insists on staying.
-So?

518
00:39:42,088 --> 00:39:43,464
[sighs] He's painfully annoying.

519
00:39:43,547 --> 00:39:46,717
Ugh, he's honestly so stupid
and talks way too much.

520
00:39:48,010 --> 00:39:50,721
Can't you just work with me
on this, mister?

521
00:39:50,805 --> 00:39:54,183
We'll tell him we're good again
and get him out of here.

522
00:39:54,266 --> 00:39:56,894
Well, he actually did
book this place, unlike you.

523
00:39:56,977 --> 00:39:58,396
He's a police officer.

524
00:39:59,480 --> 00:40:00,564
You really want him here?

525
00:40:00,648 --> 00:40:02,566
Having him here puts me at ease.

526
00:40:02,650 --> 00:40:04,527
[chuckles] My God.

527
00:40:07,071 --> 00:40:08,739
How about we…

528
00:40:10,741 --> 00:40:12,410
go halves on this place?

529
00:40:12,493 --> 00:40:14,203
[commentator 1]
Cho Hyun-oo catches the ball!

530
00:40:14,286 --> 00:40:17,373
[commentator 2] After scoring one,
they come up with another delicate play.

531
00:40:17,456 --> 00:40:19,667
-[commentator 1] They sure do.
-A long ball into the head.

532
00:40:19,750 --> 00:40:21,168
A simple yet effective play.

533
00:40:22,002 --> 00:40:23,838
-Split it?
-Mm.

534
00:40:24,672 --> 00:40:27,007
We can meet in the middle.

535
00:40:27,883 --> 00:40:30,428
I don't need this room anyways,
if I'm honest.

536
00:40:31,262 --> 00:40:34,223
So I'll live in here,
and you'll live over there?

537
00:40:35,391 --> 00:40:37,059
-That's what you wanna do?
-Mm.

538
00:40:37,560 --> 00:40:39,687
[both laughing]

539
00:40:40,396 --> 00:40:41,730
You bitch.

[unsettling music playing]

541
00:40:44,692 --> 00:40:46,026
Don't call me that, okay?

542
00:40:46,110 --> 00:40:48,320
Live together with a murderer?

543
00:40:49,488 --> 00:40:50,489
With you?

544
00:40:55,786 --> 00:40:57,580
Do you wanna know how I killed him?

545
00:40:59,832 --> 00:41:01,750
I can tell you in great detail

546
00:41:02,585 --> 00:41:04,086
what I did to Si-hyeon.

547
00:41:04,670 --> 00:41:09,717
Do you really think you can live here
after hearing what I did to that poor boy?

548
00:41:11,177 --> 00:41:12,386
Just face it.

549
00:41:13,846 --> 00:41:15,473
It belongs to me already.

550
00:41:15,973 --> 00:41:18,767
I'm letting you keep this room
because I pity you.

This isn't your house.

554
00:41:39,580 --> 00:41:41,081
I don't need another reason.

555
00:41:42,124 --> 00:41:44,376
I have no intention
of giving anything to you.

[panting]

562
00:42:32,883 --> 00:42:33,801
What happened?

563
00:42:34,927 --> 00:42:36,136
That bastard.

564
00:42:36,804 --> 00:42:37,763
[woman] Hold on.

And that's my bed.

590
00:46:37,753 --> 00:46:38,629
Get out.

You might be a paying guest,
but this is still trespassing.

The two of you are…

[Yeong-ha grunts]

00:46:53,185 --> 00:46:54,269
You son of a bitch!

00:46:54,353 --> 00:46:56,855
-Have you lost your mind?
-Whoa! I dropped my weapon.

598
00:46:56,939 --> 00:46:59,233
Let go. Let go of me right now.

599
00:46:59,316 --> 00:47:02,444
You're the… the police.
You're a police officer.

600
00:47:02,986 --> 00:47:04,863
Wake the hell up, you dumb bastard.

601
00:47:06,406 --> 00:47:07,825
[Seon-tae] Give me a fucking break!

602

[both grunting]

603
00:47:09,034 --> 00:47:10,994
You'll break my arm! Hey. Let go.

604
00:47:11,078 --> 00:47:12,913
You're gonna break it. Okay, okay.

605
00:47:13,831 --> 00:47:15,499

[car doors open, close]

613
00:47:55,247 --> 00:47:58,417
I heard Officer Kim responded
to a call at your rental recently.

614
00:47:58,500 --> 00:48:01,295
-Was there some kind of problem?
-No.

615
00:48:04,172 --> 00:48:06,133
How about when you came to the station?

616
00:48:06,758 --> 00:48:09,052
[mysterious music playing]

617
00:48:09,136 --> 00:48:11,722
You came in
and just walked right out the door.

618
00:48:13,765 --> 00:48:15,475
What brought you here that day?

619
00:48:22,482 --> 00:48:23,609
Guests are only allowed

620
00:48:23,692 --> 00:48:27,279
to use the main house,
the yard, and the swimming pool.

621
00:48:28,530 --> 00:48:31,742
Those two tonight
were in my personal quarters.

622
00:48:33,911 --> 00:48:35,746
They were in there without my permission.

623
00:48:37,748 --> 00:48:39,917
Have you ever hit someone out of anger?

624
00:48:41,376 --> 00:48:43,295
I'm not trying to imply anything,

625
00:48:43,378 --> 00:48:47,883
but it takes a lot for the anger you feel
to lead to physically harming somebody.

626
00:48:48,634 --> 00:48:51,345
Getting into street fights,
practicing martial arts,

627
00:48:51,428 --> 00:48:55,307
gambling, drinking, drugs,
or even experiencing physical assault.

628
00:48:55,390 --> 00:48:59,811
Something needs to happen in one's life
for them to get violent like that.

629
00:48:59,895 --> 00:49:01,021
[chuckles]

630
00:49:03,398 --> 00:49:04,733
So you're telling me

631
00:49:06,276 --> 00:49:08,153
that someone who's lived like me…

632
00:49:10,030 --> 00:49:11,782
has no choice but to be helpless.

633
00:49:12,532 --> 00:49:15,160
Sounds to me like there's something
you wanna fight against.

634
00:49:23,669 --> 00:49:24,962
[sighs]

635
00:49:27,714 --> 00:49:29,549
I wanted to file a report.

636
00:49:29,633 --> 00:49:30,884
For what reason?

637
00:49:41,395 --> 00:49:42,521
It's all over.

638
00:49:44,523 --> 00:49:45,732
There's nothing anymore.

639
00:49:49,194 --> 00:49:50,612
I can still listen to your story.

Excuse me for a second.

645
00:50:33,447 --> 00:50:34,698
Can I go home, please?

646
00:50:40,078 --> 00:50:41,913
-I can give you a ride.
-That's okay.

647
00:50:47,586 --> 00:50:50,839
What happened today with Officer Kim…
Can we just let it go?

648
00:50:52,340 --> 00:50:56,303
I just… never want him
coming back to my rental again.

649
00:50:58,305 --> 00:50:59,973
I'll give him a full refund.

650
00:51:00,640 --> 00:51:01,892
I will let him know.

651
00:51:07,564 --> 00:51:09,107

[Choi] Causing trouble on your vacation?

654
00:51:40,097 --> 00:51:42,599
[Seon-tae] Man, you know,
you didn't have to come.

655
00:51:43,100 --> 00:51:44,601
I was patrolling the area.

656
00:51:46,186 --> 00:51:48,522
Captain Yoon already smoothed things over
with that owner.

657
00:51:48,605 --> 00:51:50,190
And what about the woman?

658
00:51:51,900 --> 00:51:52,859
Seon-tae.

659
00:51:55,445 --> 00:51:58,490
I know you want bigger
and greater things from your career.

660
00:51:59,241 --> 00:52:03,203
You'll get promoted soon.
Don't put yourself in a bind.

661
00:52:05,288 --> 00:52:06,915
You know what I'm saying, right?

662
00:52:08,625 --> 00:52:09,459
Yeah.

663
00:52:10,710 --> 00:52:13,171
Let's go. I'll give you a ride.

664
00:52:13,255 --> 00:52:15,674
I'll… take a cab. Thanks.

665
00:52:17,300 --> 00:52:18,218
All right.

666
00:52:19,803 --> 00:52:20,971
See you later.

667
00:52:21,054 --> 00:52:22,097
Have a good night.

[woman] Why did you have to
take things this far?

686
00:56:26,383 --> 00:56:28,468
I'll sell you my house.

[mysterious music playing]

688
00:56:36,726 --> 00:56:37,977
Are you serious?

689
00:56:40,814 --> 00:56:42,065
That's incredible.

690
00:56:44,067 --> 00:56:46,152
That's exactly what I needed to hear.

691
00:56:48,571 --> 00:56:49,823
Just wait a few days.

692
00:56:55,745 --> 00:56:58,289
[young Bo-min] Moisture… to be precise.

693
00:57:01,376 --> 00:57:03,920
There wasn't a single bit of moisture
in that house.

694
00:57:06,756 --> 00:57:10,093
The property hadn't been charged for water
for the past two months.

695
00:57:11,344 --> 00:57:14,722
I thought, "Why didn't they use any water?
The pipes are working just fine."

696
00:57:14,806 --> 00:57:15,932
[rumbling]

[water sloshing]

698
00:57:18,059 --> 00:57:21,813
I checked the water tank on the rooftop,
and there was nothing inside.

[sighs]

700
00:57:27,902 --> 00:57:31,448
But that water tank on the hill
was visible from that rooftop.

701
00:57:31,531 --> 00:57:33,408
The killer couldn't use any water.

702
00:57:34,159 --> 00:57:36,286
It reminded him of the body in that tank.

703
00:57:37,912 --> 00:57:38,830
Whoa!

704
00:57:39,998 --> 00:57:43,209
How do you figure that out
from seeing that?

705
00:57:43,293 --> 00:57:44,627
It's not what you see.

706
00:57:45,420 --> 00:57:46,504
It's the opposite.

707
00:57:47,005 --> 00:57:49,591
Not what's there, but what's missing.

708
00:57:50,341 --> 00:57:54,095
Looking for what should be there,
but for some reason, it isn't.

709
00:57:54,721 --> 00:57:56,764
-That's what I look for.
-What should be there.

710
00:57:56,848 --> 00:58:00,477
So something like
their environment or everyday life?

711
00:58:00,560 --> 00:58:02,395
And in themselves as well.

712
00:58:04,606 --> 00:58:08,151
What emotions or behaviors
are missing in someone.

713
00:58:09,319 --> 00:58:13,156
What words or time frames seem
to be slightly off in their testimony,

714
00:58:13,990 --> 00:58:15,492
or eye contact they're avoiding.

715
00:58:15,575 --> 00:58:17,994
Oh!

716
00:58:20,288 --> 00:58:21,456
Surely that's…

717
00:58:23,416 --> 00:58:26,878
that's only with certain
work-related cases, right?

718
00:58:26,961 --> 00:58:28,922
You can't analyze everyone like that.

719
00:58:33,092 --> 00:58:34,260
[pensive music playing]

720
00:58:35,929 --> 00:58:36,804
But I do.

721
00:58:39,098 --> 00:58:40,183
I doubt everyone.

722
00:58:42,310 --> 00:58:46,272
Victims, their neighbors,
their family, or anyone.

723
00:58:48,691 --> 00:58:49,943
My coworkers too.

724
00:58:51,194 --> 00:58:53,905
Even my loved ones, my neighbors.

725
00:58:53,988 --> 00:58:56,032
Team Leader Kang, Detective Cho.

726
00:58:59,619 --> 00:59:01,120
Everyone in this building.

727
00:59:02,455 --> 00:59:04,541
Especially everyone in this building.

728
00:59:05,333 --> 00:59:08,336
And you. As you sit beside me, Mr. Yeom.

729
00:59:10,046 --> 00:59:12,340
I see and evaluate everyone equally.

730
00:59:13,841 --> 00:59:15,677
I don't make an exception for anybody.

731
00:59:18,805 --> 00:59:19,722
You're thorough.

732
00:59:23,101 --> 00:59:24,519
I know I'm not some heroic cop

733
00:59:24,602 --> 00:59:27,021
who's catching criminals
in the hunt for justice.

734
00:59:28,982 --> 00:59:29,899
I'm just…

735
00:59:31,818 --> 00:59:33,820
[unsettling music playing]

736
00:59:50,587 --> 00:59:52,589
[music fades]

737
01:00:08,896 --> 01:00:10,898
[unsettling music playing]

738
01:00:20,116 --> 01:00:22,118
[dramatic music playing]

739
01:00:32,295 --> 01:00:33,880
[Bo-min] We're all just

740
01:00:35,506 --> 01:00:38,509
playing a game of tag, and I'm "It."

741
01:00:38,593 --> 01:00:40,511
[dramatic music playing]

742
01:01:32,647 --> 01:01:34,565
[music fades]
