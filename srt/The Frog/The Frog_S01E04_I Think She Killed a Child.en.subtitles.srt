1
00:00:36,119 --> 00:00:37,954
A giant tree fell in a forest…

2
00:00:40,457 --> 00:00:42,542
and no one was around to hear it.

3
00:01:25,418 --> 00:01:28,755
Did it… make a sound…

4
00:01:33,635 --> 00:01:35,136
or was there nothing but silence?

5
00:01:42,894 --> 00:01:45,647
THE FROG

6
00:01:45,730 --> 00:01:49,317
RAINBOW MOTEL

7
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:52,070
Let's go inside. Come on.

8
00:01:52,987 --> 00:01:54,989
Let's go inside just once!

9
00:01:57,033 --> 00:02:00,120
Hey, just this once, please?

10
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:04,541
Mom.

11
00:02:09,546 --> 00:02:11,965
Not bad, huh?
Come take a look, Eun-gyeong.

12
00:02:15,301 --> 00:02:16,136
Come on.

13
00:02:17,804 --> 00:02:19,597
Hurry up!

14
00:02:22,308 --> 00:02:24,894
This place is up for auction,
and it's just amazing!

15
00:02:24,978 --> 00:02:28,064
Remember the lake we saw?
You can see it all from here.

16
00:02:28,565 --> 00:02:29,649
Come quickly.

17
00:02:32,152 --> 00:02:33,570
In here. Come on.

18
00:02:35,572 --> 00:02:36,573
Man!

19
00:02:37,282 --> 00:02:40,160
Take a look. The view's amazing, isn't it?

20
00:02:40,243 --> 00:02:43,246
An annual flower festival
will be held next year. Look.

21
00:02:43,329 --> 00:02:46,749
They're planting flowering trees
all around the lake as we speak.

22
00:02:46,833 --> 00:02:48,501
Ask your sister. She'll know.

23
00:02:48,585 --> 00:02:50,670
She worked and lived here for two years.

24
00:02:51,254 --> 00:02:52,547
What am I gonna do with you?

25
00:02:52,630 --> 00:02:55,258
Wait. You already asked her, didn't you?

26
00:02:56,885 --> 00:02:57,719
Really?

27
00:03:01,347 --> 00:03:04,017
Son, this motel is ours now!

28
00:03:06,144 --> 00:03:07,145
Do you like that?

29
00:03:09,063 --> 00:03:12,901
I always felt like I wasn't good enough.

30
00:03:14,527 --> 00:03:18,781
I know how much both you and Gi-ho
are struggling to deal with all this.

31
00:03:19,616 --> 00:03:21,534
I'm sorry for making this decision.

32
00:03:22,827 --> 00:03:25,371
I can't get the image of the woman

33
00:03:26,331 --> 00:03:28,249
who died here out of my head.

34
00:03:29,626 --> 00:03:31,669
And I'm willing to do whatever it takes

35
00:03:32,837 --> 00:03:34,130
to make it go away.

36
00:03:37,550 --> 00:03:39,469
Look at me, being a drama queen again.

37
00:03:42,222 --> 00:03:45,934
I just want to be at peace.

38
00:03:46,517 --> 00:03:48,102
I hope you can understand that.

39
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:51,898
I'm sorry, Sang-jun.

40
00:03:53,233 --> 00:03:54,817
And please tell Gi-ho…

41
00:04:16,464 --> 00:04:18,549
that Mom loves him very much.

42
00:04:23,930 --> 00:04:25,014
Mr. Ji Hyang-cheol.

43
00:04:25,807 --> 00:04:28,893
I'm Yoon Bo-min,
an officer at Dongho Police Station.

44
00:04:30,061 --> 00:04:31,062
We wanted to ask you--

45
00:04:31,145 --> 00:04:32,146
Who are you?

46
00:04:40,905 --> 00:04:42,907
JOONGMIN DAILY
YEOM DONG-CHAN, REPORTER

47
00:04:48,997 --> 00:04:50,206
You're not a reporter.

48
00:04:51,207 --> 00:04:52,125
Wait.

49
00:04:52,208 --> 00:04:53,584
You should remember me.

50
00:04:55,878 --> 00:04:57,505
You, of all people.

51
00:05:02,302 --> 00:05:03,553
Because of you, I…

52
00:05:03,636 --> 00:05:05,221
You're very kind.

53
00:05:09,058 --> 00:05:10,601
Because of you, my family…

54
00:05:11,394 --> 00:05:12,645
Gi-ho!

55
00:05:18,276 --> 00:05:19,777
Are you related to a victim?

56
00:05:32,915 --> 00:05:33,750
Why me?

57
00:05:36,627 --> 00:05:37,795
Why my family?

58
00:05:39,505 --> 00:05:41,007
What have I done wrong?

59
00:05:43,343 --> 00:05:45,386
What did my family do to deserve this?

60
00:05:47,847 --> 00:05:49,891
Why did you have to pass by
at that moment?

61
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:52,685
Why did you have to run into me that day?

62
00:05:52,769 --> 00:05:53,603
Wrong.

63
00:05:57,815 --> 00:05:58,733
That's not it.

64
00:06:02,487 --> 00:06:04,280
I was just on the road,

65
00:06:05,698 --> 00:06:07,533
minding my own business,

66
00:06:07,617 --> 00:06:10,203
and you lot just happened to be
on that road.

67
00:06:21,589 --> 00:06:22,757
Why were you there?

68
00:06:24,217 --> 00:06:26,469
On that day, at that moment.

69
00:06:27,804 --> 00:06:30,723
Like I said,
I was just minding my own business.

70
00:06:32,475 --> 00:06:35,895
You should be asking yourself
those questions.

71
00:06:35,978 --> 00:06:37,397
Don't blame others.

72
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:39,148
-Wanna know why they croaked?
-Hey.

73
00:06:39,232 --> 00:06:41,067
Their time was up, that's all.

74
00:06:42,068 --> 00:06:44,529
-It's got nothing to do with me.
-Shut your mouth.

75
00:06:49,617 --> 00:06:50,952
I'm spelling it out for him.

76
00:06:52,245 --> 00:06:54,080
It's more sincere than just apologizing.

77
00:07:34,954 --> 00:07:36,372
We'll give you a ride home.

78
00:07:36,456 --> 00:07:37,707
No, that's okay.

79
00:07:41,002 --> 00:07:42,003
How are you doing?

80
00:07:44,714 --> 00:07:46,299
I heard you moved.

81
00:07:49,302 --> 00:07:50,887
Thanks for your help today.

82
00:07:50,970 --> 00:07:52,889
No, you don't have to.

83
00:07:58,811 --> 00:08:00,480
I really wanted to see him,

84
00:08:01,981 --> 00:08:06,402
not that I had anything to do
or say to him in particular.

85
00:08:14,827 --> 00:08:16,120
Officer Yoon.

86
00:08:20,875 --> 00:08:22,293
Don't ever be the frog.

87
00:08:25,338 --> 00:08:26,339
I'm sorry?

88
00:08:29,258 --> 00:08:31,677
The frog that gets hit
by a stone thrown carelessly.

89
00:08:36,849 --> 00:08:38,601
When you're that frog,

90
00:08:40,019 --> 00:08:41,812
even as your head spins,

91
00:08:42,939 --> 00:08:44,398
your body withers,

92
00:08:45,858 --> 00:08:47,860
and your breathing gets shallower…

93
00:08:50,112 --> 00:08:51,906
all you can do is keep thinking,

94
00:08:52,907 --> 00:08:54,784
"Who threw that stone?"

95
00:08:56,494 --> 00:08:58,496
"Why did it have to hit me?"

96
00:09:11,884 --> 00:09:15,888
WOORI PHARMACY

97
00:09:42,498 --> 00:09:43,416
Mr. Jeon.

98
00:09:59,682 --> 00:10:00,766
SONG JI-SU PEDIATRICS

99
00:10:04,270 --> 00:10:05,855
-Hello.
-Hi.

100
00:10:07,106 --> 00:10:07,940
Dad!

101
00:10:09,150 --> 00:10:12,028
-Why didn't you call first?
-I happened to be in the area.

102
00:10:12,528 --> 00:10:14,614
Why don't we go have lunch together?

103
00:10:14,697 --> 00:10:15,531
Let's go.

104
00:10:15,615 --> 00:10:17,575
That's okay. I just wanted to say hi.

105
00:10:18,326 --> 00:10:21,162
-Come on. He'll buy us something nice.
-She's right.

106
00:10:21,245 --> 00:10:24,332
No, I really should get going. I…

107
00:10:24,915 --> 00:10:27,001
-Are you meeting someone?
-Yeah.

108
00:10:29,629 --> 00:10:30,796
Yong-chae.

109
00:10:31,714 --> 00:10:32,840
Yong-chae?

110
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:36,802
He's in a hospital in Seoul?

111
00:10:38,346 --> 00:10:39,180
Yes.

112
00:10:45,728 --> 00:10:46,562
Dad!

113
00:10:47,730 --> 00:10:49,148
Some supplements for Yong-chae.

114
00:10:49,982 --> 00:10:51,859
I wish I could pay him a visit.

115
00:10:51,942 --> 00:10:53,569
He told me not to bring you.

116
00:10:53,653 --> 00:10:56,405
I hope he takes care of his fracture.
These are for you.

117
00:10:56,489 --> 00:10:58,074
Please! I don't need any.

118
00:10:58,157 --> 00:10:59,825
Please take them, sir.

119
00:10:59,909 --> 00:11:01,494
-You two!
-Take them.

120
00:11:01,577 --> 00:11:03,120
You look like you've lost weight.

121
00:11:03,204 --> 00:11:04,872
Is it because of the summer heat?

122
00:11:12,922 --> 00:11:13,756
Dad?

123
00:11:26,060 --> 00:11:27,144
Hey, you!

124
00:11:34,276 --> 00:11:35,111
Mr. Jeon!

125
00:11:37,488 --> 00:11:39,407
-Are you all right? Are you hurt?
-Dad!

126
00:11:39,490 --> 00:11:40,324
Dad!

127
00:11:41,409 --> 00:11:42,493
Dad, are you okay?

128
00:11:53,713 --> 00:11:54,630
Ui-seon.

129
00:11:56,215 --> 00:11:59,719
Have you had any women
acting strangely in the pharmacy?

130
00:12:01,637 --> 00:12:03,389
Dad, is something wrong?

131
00:12:05,433 --> 00:12:07,017
No, nothing's wrong.

132
00:12:07,101 --> 00:12:09,061
Are you sure you're okay to drive?

133
00:12:10,479 --> 00:12:11,564
Yeah, I'm fine.

134
00:12:12,314 --> 00:12:13,149
See you later.

135
00:12:48,267 --> 00:12:50,186
Mr. Koo insisted I take this,

136
00:12:50,269 --> 00:12:52,438
but it's not right for me to keep it.

137
00:12:57,610 --> 00:12:59,028
How did it feel to meet him?

138
00:13:00,070 --> 00:13:01,238
Ji Hyang-cheol, I mean.

139
00:13:02,281 --> 00:13:04,366
I was just doing Mr. Koo a favor.

140
00:13:04,450 --> 00:13:05,951
Did it get your blood pumping?

141
00:13:10,790 --> 00:13:12,291
Why did you become a cop?

142
00:13:13,876 --> 00:13:16,712
I just kind of fell into it.

143
00:13:16,796 --> 00:13:17,797
You say "just" a lot.

144
00:13:19,548 --> 00:13:20,674
Were you an athlete?

145
00:13:21,467 --> 00:13:22,468
Track and field.

146
00:13:22,968 --> 00:13:24,053
Were you any good?

147
00:13:24,678 --> 00:13:25,513
No.

148
00:13:26,931 --> 00:13:28,599
If you were, I guess you'd be a pro.

149
00:13:29,558 --> 00:13:33,062
Anyway, after all that running,
you chose a job that requires you to run.

150
00:13:35,731 --> 00:13:36,857
Why did you take the photos?

151
00:13:50,746 --> 00:13:52,748
Are you just drawn to this stuff?

152
00:13:53,833 --> 00:13:55,751
To murder, crime scenes,

153
00:13:55,835 --> 00:13:58,420
the stench of blood, and criminals?

154
00:13:59,171 --> 00:14:00,840
Do you find it interesting?

155
00:14:03,050 --> 00:14:05,219
You can be honest. I'm not mad.

156
00:14:05,970 --> 00:14:09,765
People don't understand those
who find crimes and criminals interesting,

157
00:14:11,016 --> 00:14:11,934
but I do.

158
00:14:13,102 --> 00:14:15,521
I heard you caught that bicycle thief

159
00:14:15,604 --> 00:14:18,858
and that you stopped a man on the street
who turned out to be wanted.

160
00:14:18,941 --> 00:14:22,903
You shrugged it off as sheer luck,
but that's not true.

161
00:14:24,071 --> 00:14:27,157
Did you catch those criminals
just to protect the citizens?

162
00:14:27,241 --> 00:14:28,325
I don't think so.

163
00:14:29,451 --> 00:14:32,538
Did you pay Ji a visit
just because that motel owner asked?

164
00:14:33,205 --> 00:14:34,331
I doubt that.

165
00:14:34,415 --> 00:14:38,043
You wanted to see him for yourself.
That's why you called and asked me.

166
00:14:41,881 --> 00:14:45,968
Pure rage against criminals
and personal revenge make good detectives.

167
00:14:47,511 --> 00:14:50,097
But instincts like yours are just as good.

168
00:14:51,432 --> 00:14:54,852
The way I see it, some people are born
to be "It" in this game.

169
00:14:57,146 --> 00:15:00,149
It's in their nature to be "It"
while others run and hide.

170
00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:09,408
I have no idea what you're talking about.

171
00:15:12,912 --> 00:15:16,373
If you ever make up your mind,
come to the Violent Crimes Team.

172
00:15:37,436 --> 00:15:40,105
Are you just drawn to this stuff?

173
00:15:41,398 --> 00:15:47,321
To murder, crime scenes,
the stench of blood, and criminals?

174
00:15:49,490 --> 00:15:50,866
Do you find it interesting?

175
00:16:30,155 --> 00:16:31,198
PARK YONG-CHAE

176
00:16:34,827 --> 00:16:37,746
Are you here to see
how a fake patient is doing?

177
00:16:37,830 --> 00:16:39,540
-Are you all right?
-Let's go out.

178
00:16:39,623 --> 00:16:41,083
No way. You're injured.

179
00:16:41,166 --> 00:16:44,420
I'm going stir-crazy in here!
Besides, it's just a broken ankle.

180
00:16:44,503 --> 00:16:46,005
These are from Ui-seon.

181
00:16:46,088 --> 00:16:47,423
From the pharmacist herself?

182
00:16:48,424 --> 00:16:52,428
Tell her you're in a hospital in Seoul
and that you didn't want her to visit you.

183
00:16:53,345 --> 00:16:54,179
Seoul?

184
00:16:59,601 --> 00:17:00,769
Pretty good, right?

185
00:17:02,021 --> 00:17:04,773
If I ever end up in here again,
I might get ten kilos fatter.

186
00:17:11,613 --> 00:17:13,115
I can't let you drink.

187
00:17:13,615 --> 00:17:16,618
Are you kidding me?
I gotta have a drink with my jjamppong!

188
00:17:18,120 --> 00:17:19,580
How are you gonna drive home?

189
00:17:20,205 --> 00:17:21,957
I'll be your caregiver for the day.

190
00:17:25,044 --> 00:17:26,462
You remember that woman?

191
00:17:28,213 --> 00:17:30,215
-From last year.
-What?

192
00:17:30,883 --> 00:17:34,553
The air conditioner in your rental broke,
so you brought her to stay at mine.

193
00:17:36,805 --> 00:17:38,849
That kid I played with in the pool!

194
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:40,768
Yeah. What about her?

195
00:17:48,859 --> 00:17:50,778
I think she killed that child.

196
00:17:53,530 --> 00:17:54,615
What?

197
00:18:15,177 --> 00:18:16,595
Yeah. What about her?

198
00:18:25,104 --> 00:18:26,772
She left something at the rental.

199
00:18:27,481 --> 00:18:29,733
I still have it
because I don't know her number.

200
00:18:30,317 --> 00:18:31,401
Last year?

201
00:18:34,446 --> 00:18:35,280
Yes.

202
00:18:37,241 --> 00:18:41,245
She would've called if she wanted it back.
Is it something valuable?

203
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:46,500
Then you should give it back.

204
00:18:47,918 --> 00:18:49,837
By the way, don't you like the food?

205
00:18:54,466 --> 00:18:55,968
My stomach's a little upset.

206
00:19:03,225 --> 00:19:04,434
A record of the booking?

207
00:19:05,435 --> 00:19:07,563
I got her number
when she paid the deposit,

208
00:19:07,646 --> 00:19:09,773
and the AC was repaired the next day, so…

209
00:19:10,983 --> 00:19:13,944
It was on this day.
She booked it under Ha Si-hyeon.

210
00:19:15,237 --> 00:19:16,238
It's Si-hyeon.

211
00:19:16,989 --> 00:19:18,240
Ha Si-hyeon.

212
00:19:21,827 --> 00:19:23,996
The kid's name was used for the booking,

213
00:19:25,164 --> 00:19:27,082
and the phone number was out of service.

214
00:19:28,792 --> 00:19:31,128
That woman had a key to my rental

215
00:19:32,796 --> 00:19:34,965
and knew what my daughter looked like,

216
00:19:36,925 --> 00:19:39,303
but I didn't even know her name.

217
00:20:13,128 --> 00:20:14,213
It's an apricot tree.

218
00:20:15,047 --> 00:20:16,882
Very popular for gardens.

219
00:20:16,965 --> 00:20:18,967
You must have a pretty big yard.

220
00:20:19,635 --> 00:20:21,762
My family runs a vacation rental.

221
00:20:22,846 --> 00:20:25,015
Why don't you take one home?
They're pretty.

222
00:20:50,958 --> 00:20:52,918
I guess you were out yesterday.

223
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:17,192
Would you like to have lunch with me?

224
00:21:30,414 --> 00:21:33,417
I needed to know
more about that woman too.

225
00:24:09,156 --> 00:24:10,407
Hey! Where are you--

226
00:24:29,342 --> 00:24:32,429
I can unlock it,
but only by formatting the hard drive.

227
00:24:32,512 --> 00:24:34,014
Will that wipe out everything?

228
00:24:34,806 --> 00:24:36,391
Yes, all of it.

229
00:24:44,691 --> 00:24:46,026
Is it your daughter's?

230
00:27:34,653 --> 00:27:37,572
WELCOME DRINK
COURTESY OF WOORI PHARMACY

231
00:27:59,427 --> 00:28:00,512
What's going on here?

232
00:28:01,137 --> 00:28:03,181
We got a call asking to pick these up.

233
00:28:03,264 --> 00:28:04,099
What call?

234
00:28:05,016 --> 00:28:06,267
This is my house.

235
00:28:14,651 --> 00:28:17,987
Put them back.
Unload everything and leave.

236
00:28:18,988 --> 00:28:20,699
-You heard me!
-Unload it.

237
00:30:02,050 --> 00:30:05,970
Yes, but if it's too soiled,
it might not come off.

238
00:30:06,054 --> 00:30:08,306
So… Gum will come off.

239
00:30:08,389 --> 00:30:13,061
Yes, I'll have to take a look for myself,
so it'd be great if you could bring it in.

240
00:30:13,144 --> 00:30:14,312
Yes, goodbye.

241
00:30:15,063 --> 00:30:16,314
May I take your order?

242
00:30:16,815 --> 00:30:19,317
An iced Americano, please.

243
00:30:19,400 --> 00:30:20,902
One iced Americano.

244
00:30:25,865 --> 00:30:27,200
That's a lot of coins.

245
00:30:32,622 --> 00:30:33,957
Can I take some pictures?

246
00:30:34,916 --> 00:30:36,251
Sorry? Pictures?

247
00:30:37,418 --> 00:30:39,003
This place is so pretty.

248
00:30:40,421 --> 00:30:43,091
I want to use the colors
as a reference for my art.

249
00:30:43,174 --> 00:30:45,426
Of course you can. By all means!

250
00:31:17,208 --> 00:31:19,919
I put a lot of thought into the design.
Nice, isn't it?

251
00:31:20,003 --> 00:31:20,962
I love it.

252
00:31:27,802 --> 00:31:31,139
The coffee is great too.
You might as well run a café instead.

253
00:31:31,723 --> 00:31:35,059
Actually,
that's what I was originally planning.

254
00:31:37,103 --> 00:31:38,479
I should come here often.

255
00:31:39,647 --> 00:31:42,317
How did you end up in this town anyway?

256
00:31:42,817 --> 00:31:45,612
Are you staying
in a vacation rental nearby?

257
00:31:46,613 --> 00:31:47,947
I'm staying here for a month.

258
00:31:48,031 --> 00:31:50,575
Is that so?
Which rental are you staying at?

259
00:31:52,243 --> 00:31:55,163
I'm not sure what it's called,
but it's in the woods.

260
00:31:56,247 --> 00:31:57,665
That's Yeong-ha's place.

261
00:31:57,749 --> 00:32:00,251
The isolated rental
at the end of the forest road.

262
00:32:00,835 --> 00:32:03,087
-Yeah.
-That's a nice place.

263
00:32:03,171 --> 00:32:05,089
How come I didn't know he had a guest?

264
00:32:05,965 --> 00:32:09,385
I know all the rental owners around here.
I'm good friends with them.

265
00:32:10,553 --> 00:32:13,056
That's strange.
Yeong-ha never mentioned you to me.

266
00:32:14,849 --> 00:32:16,059
We'd like to order.

267
00:32:16,976 --> 00:32:18,394
Well, enjoy your coffee.

268
00:32:19,854 --> 00:32:20,855
What do you want?

269
00:32:22,523 --> 00:32:23,441
Be right there.

270
00:32:24,108 --> 00:32:25,109
Chocolate latte?

271
00:32:30,740 --> 00:32:32,158
I want to watch a movie.

272
00:32:47,548 --> 00:32:50,718
If you have any questions, just ask.

273
00:32:51,719 --> 00:32:52,553
I do.

274
00:32:55,598 --> 00:32:56,683
I have questions.

275
00:33:46,357 --> 00:33:47,358
Take a good look.

276
00:34:05,168 --> 00:34:06,252
It's safe, see?

277
00:34:22,852 --> 00:34:24,312
Do you want to kill me, Mister?

278
00:34:31,152 --> 00:34:32,236
So you do.

279
00:34:33,738 --> 00:34:34,989
What's your plan?

280
00:34:35,990 --> 00:34:36,991
What plan?

281
00:34:43,498 --> 00:34:45,249
I'm just a guest

282
00:34:46,417 --> 00:34:47,668
staying at your rental.

283
00:34:50,338 --> 00:34:51,839
Am I not like the other guests?

284
00:34:58,471 --> 00:35:00,807
-What did you do with the kid?
-What kid?

285
00:35:00,890 --> 00:35:03,142
The kid you brought here a year ago.

286
00:35:04,644 --> 00:35:05,478
Si-hyeon.

287
00:35:08,898 --> 00:35:10,900
You left here alone in the morning.

288
00:35:12,652 --> 00:35:14,403
I have dashcam footage of you.

289
00:35:15,029 --> 00:35:16,405
Is there anything else?

290
00:35:22,203 --> 00:35:24,539
I found a bloodstain while cleaning up.

291
00:35:25,373 --> 00:35:26,249
And?

292
00:35:29,544 --> 00:35:33,381
Two of… my towels went missing.

293
00:35:33,464 --> 00:35:34,298
And?

294
00:35:38,553 --> 00:35:39,387
The bathroom.

295
00:35:42,473 --> 00:35:43,724
It smelled like bleach.

296
00:35:47,061 --> 00:35:47,895
So?

297
00:35:49,564 --> 00:35:51,232
What did you do after that?

298
00:35:57,238 --> 00:36:00,241
So, the only thing you have now…

299
00:36:02,618 --> 00:36:04,203
is the dashcam footage.

300
00:36:06,372 --> 00:36:09,041
You do realize
that hardly counts as evidence, right?

301
00:36:11,335 --> 00:36:12,837
Fine, let's say you're right.

302
00:36:13,838 --> 00:36:16,591
Say I came here a year ago with some kid,

303
00:36:17,091 --> 00:36:18,801
left by myself the next day,

304
00:36:20,511 --> 00:36:22,346
and the kid was nowhere to be found.

305
00:36:22,930 --> 00:36:25,600
According to you,
even his body couldn't be found.

306
00:36:27,101 --> 00:36:32,315
After that, instead of calling the police
or even going to find me,

307
00:36:33,232 --> 00:36:38,029
you washed away the bloodstain,
cleaned the house from top to bottom,

308
00:36:38,112 --> 00:36:39,947
replaced the missing towels,

309
00:36:41,824 --> 00:36:45,578
and acted like… you'd never met me before,

310
00:36:45,661 --> 00:36:47,455
even though you recognized me.

311
00:36:51,042 --> 00:36:52,418
It sounds to me like

312
00:36:53,878 --> 00:36:55,254
we're not so different.

313
00:37:01,135 --> 00:37:05,723
I wonder what will happen
if you report this to the police now.

314
00:37:06,474 --> 00:37:10,061
I'll be charged with murder, and you

315
00:37:11,812 --> 00:37:14,106
with covering it up for an entire year.

316
00:37:15,650 --> 00:37:19,487
But seriously,
think about what happened that day.

317
00:37:20,238 --> 00:37:22,531
Did anyone come to see you
in the past year?

318
00:37:23,324 --> 00:37:26,661
Did anyone notice anything suspicious
and come here to find out what happened?

319
00:37:32,416 --> 00:37:33,584
What if I asked you

320
00:37:35,127 --> 00:37:36,254
to sell me this house?

321
00:37:37,004 --> 00:37:37,838
What?

322
00:37:41,676 --> 00:37:44,762
I don't know
what this house might mean to you,

323
00:37:46,180 --> 00:37:50,685
but it's come to mean so much to me.

324
00:37:52,270 --> 00:37:54,230
To be honest, before coming here,

325
00:37:54,313 --> 00:37:56,315
I had forgotten who I was for a while.

326
00:37:57,858 --> 00:37:58,693
But…

327
00:38:00,820 --> 00:38:02,488
here, I found myself again.

328
00:38:08,786 --> 00:38:11,414
Well, if you don't want to sell it,
that's fine.

329
00:38:12,540 --> 00:38:15,042
I'll come back every summer

330
00:38:16,210 --> 00:38:17,211
for just a month.

331
00:38:23,134 --> 00:38:25,303
Let's not try to find out
too much about each other,

332
00:38:25,886 --> 00:38:27,430
and everything will be fine.

333
00:39:12,058 --> 00:39:14,143
-Ui-seon, behind you.
-Okay.

334
00:39:20,024 --> 00:39:21,859
-Here, let me.
-That's okay, Doctor.

335
00:39:21,942 --> 00:39:23,861
I'll do it. I'll take this too.

336
00:39:23,944 --> 00:39:25,988
-Thank you.
-You must be tired.

337
00:39:26,072 --> 00:39:28,783
-No, I'm fine.
-I hope you can go home soon.

338
00:39:31,619 --> 00:39:33,037
Weren't you tired today?

339
00:39:33,996 --> 00:39:34,830
I was.

340
00:39:35,873 --> 00:39:37,625
It must be so exhausting.

341
00:39:37,708 --> 00:39:38,876
I'm okay for now.

342
00:39:39,627 --> 00:39:41,712
Are you not drinking beer because of me?

343
00:39:43,589 --> 00:39:44,423
Yeah.

344
00:39:45,633 --> 00:39:48,260
Just drink it.
I'm gonna be pregnant for a long time.

345
00:39:48,344 --> 00:39:49,178
Okay.

346
00:39:50,012 --> 00:39:52,181
Excuse me. Can I get a glass of beer?

347
00:39:52,264 --> 00:39:53,099
Right away.

348
00:39:57,937 --> 00:39:59,355
How's your father doing?

349
00:40:01,190 --> 00:40:03,609
He's doing all right.
I talked to him on the phone.

350
00:40:06,487 --> 00:40:08,906
His rental is nice,

351
00:40:10,408 --> 00:40:12,827
but I'm worried that he's alone out there.

352
00:40:13,744 --> 00:40:17,498
Why don't you ask him to move to Seoul
and use the place as a vacation home?

353
00:40:23,712 --> 00:40:26,215
I want Dad to be the one
to make that decision.

354
00:40:33,222 --> 00:40:35,641
-Then why don't we go to him?
-Huh?

355
00:40:35,724 --> 00:40:39,979
You said you once considered
opening a pharmacy near your dad's place.

356
00:40:40,062 --> 00:40:43,065
Things have changed.
That was before we even started dating.

357
00:40:43,149 --> 00:40:44,358
No, nothing's changed.

358
00:40:45,276 --> 00:40:48,612
We can open a pharmacy on the first floor
and a clinic upstairs.

359
00:40:52,616 --> 00:40:56,954
I wonder what will happen
if you report this to the police now.

360
00:40:57,621 --> 00:41:01,709
I'll be charged with murder… and you

361
00:41:03,127 --> 00:41:05,463
with covering it up for an entire year.

362
00:41:08,048 --> 00:41:12,344
I wonder what will happen
if you report this to the police now.

363
00:43:11,505 --> 00:43:15,843
I wonder what will happen
if you report this to the police now.

364
00:43:16,427 --> 00:43:20,764
I'll be charged with murder… and you

365
00:43:21,932 --> 00:43:24,268
with covering it up for an entire year.

366
00:43:57,801 --> 00:44:01,722
So, the only thing you have now…
is the dashcam footage.

367
00:44:02,222 --> 00:44:03,057
Shit.

368
00:45:05,035 --> 00:45:06,328
HIDE-AND-SEEK
BY YOO SEONG-A

369
00:45:33,397 --> 00:45:34,481
Sir, are you okay?

370
00:45:35,065 --> 00:45:36,066
Are you okay?

371
00:45:36,150 --> 00:45:38,819
-Call the EMT.
-On it, sir. Just a sec.

372
00:45:41,488 --> 00:45:43,240
Call the EMT now!

373
00:45:45,993 --> 00:45:48,412
There has been an accident. Please hurry.
