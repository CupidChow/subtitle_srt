1
00:01:04,064 --> 00:01:04,981
Si-hyeon.

2
00:01:06,983 --> 00:01:07,901
Si-hyeon?

3
00:01:34,552 --> 00:01:35,553
Ma'am.

4
00:01:39,099 --> 00:01:41,267
When's my dad coming?

5
00:01:49,692 --> 00:01:51,277
Once you finish your food.

6
00:01:59,744 --> 00:02:01,412
A giant tree fell in a forest…

7
00:02:04,207 --> 00:02:06,292
and no one was around to hear it.

8
00:02:08,461 --> 00:02:14,801
Did it make a sound,
or was there nothing but silence?

9
00:03:27,290 --> 00:03:34,088
THE FROG

10
00:03:54,150 --> 00:03:56,653
-I told you it starts at 9:00 a.m.
-We won't be late.

11
00:03:56,736 --> 00:03:57,820
I'll wait outside.

12
00:04:10,625 --> 00:04:12,961
The sitter will pick you up later.

13
00:04:13,044 --> 00:04:14,128
Okay.

14
00:04:14,212 --> 00:04:16,047
-One, two.
-With both arms.

15
00:04:16,130 --> 00:04:18,716
Three, four, five.

16
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:22,553
-Six, seven, eight.
-Eight.

17
00:04:22,637 --> 00:04:23,930
Now the left side.

18
00:04:24,013 --> 00:04:26,766
To the left. You have to use both hands.

19
00:04:26,849 --> 00:04:31,813
One, two, three, four, five.

20
00:04:31,896 --> 00:04:35,233
-Six, seven, eight.
-Eight.

21
00:04:35,316 --> 00:04:36,567
Now switch sides.

22
00:04:37,568 --> 00:04:43,866
One, two, three, four, five, six…

23
00:06:09,452 --> 00:06:10,328
Are you okay?

24
00:06:12,830 --> 00:06:14,749
-Sorry about that.
-It's fine.

25
00:06:14,832 --> 00:06:16,376
-It was my…
-Your hand.

26
00:06:26,344 --> 00:06:28,179
I guess you were in a hurry.

27
00:06:31,724 --> 00:06:33,059
I'll get going, then.

28
00:06:34,268 --> 00:06:35,269
Excuse…

29
00:06:39,816 --> 00:06:41,025
No, I'm sorry.

30
00:06:41,567 --> 00:06:42,402
Bye.

31
00:07:15,435 --> 00:07:16,853
What time is it?

32
00:07:20,523 --> 00:07:21,858
Did the guests leave?

33
00:07:23,025 --> 00:07:24,110
What?

34
00:07:24,193 --> 00:07:26,070
Let's clean up.

35
00:07:26,154 --> 00:07:27,613
The pool and everything.

36
00:07:27,697 --> 00:07:28,739
They're asleep.

37
00:07:29,782 --> 00:07:30,616
What?

38
00:07:33,286 --> 00:07:35,621
I think the guests are still asleep.

39
00:07:35,705 --> 00:07:36,706
Still asleep?

40
00:07:41,961 --> 00:07:44,297
Then wake me up when they're gone.

41
00:09:39,954 --> 00:09:41,038
You lied.

42
00:09:46,085 --> 00:09:46,961
They're gone.

43
00:09:48,754 --> 00:09:51,507
Leave some cleaning for me.
I'll go make breakfast.

44
00:10:02,935 --> 00:10:06,188
Are you doing this because the new captain
used to be in Violent Crimes?

45
00:10:06,272 --> 00:10:09,108
-Senior Officer Oh asked me to do it.
-Yeah, right!

46
00:10:11,027 --> 00:10:14,405
Why would I want to impress a detective
who got banished to this backwater?

47
00:10:16,824 --> 00:10:19,702
I hope they don't stick their nose
in everyone's business.

48
00:10:21,662 --> 00:10:24,457
If you want to be seen wiping that desk,

49
00:10:24,540 --> 00:10:27,585
you should know the captain
is patrolling the town right now.

50
00:10:37,345 --> 00:10:39,513
-Are you sure this is the captain?
-Yeah.

51
00:10:40,723 --> 00:10:43,809
Looks way too pale to be a cop.

52
00:10:48,064 --> 00:10:49,732
-Thank you.
-No problem.

53
00:10:57,990 --> 00:10:58,824
Hey!

54
00:11:00,326 --> 00:11:01,577
Welcome, Captain.

55
00:11:02,328 --> 00:11:03,162
Captain?

56
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:05,665
Sergeant Choi, right?

57
00:11:05,748 --> 00:11:08,000
I'd love to shake your hand, but… Come in.

58
00:11:10,252 --> 00:11:12,004
Isn't that the captain's orchid?

59
00:11:12,088 --> 00:11:13,673
Be careful not to drop it.

60
00:11:15,549 --> 00:11:16,676
FROM YEOM DONG-CHAN, HUSBAND

61
00:11:20,346 --> 00:11:21,180
YOON BO-MIN

62
00:11:21,263 --> 00:11:22,098
"It."

63
00:11:23,182 --> 00:11:25,267
You know how detectives have nicknames?

64
00:11:25,351 --> 00:11:27,520
Viper, Mad Dog, Ghost.

65
00:11:28,270 --> 00:11:31,524
Hers is "It." I have no idea why.

66
00:11:31,607 --> 00:11:34,193
Apparently, the captain
who brought her to Violent Crimes

67
00:11:34,276 --> 00:11:36,654
gave her the nickname,
and she's been "It" since then.

68
00:11:37,405 --> 00:11:40,241
No one expected much from her
because she's a woman,

69
00:11:41,117 --> 00:11:43,869
but she solved
the Geonjang-dong salesman murder,

70
00:11:43,953 --> 00:11:49,250
the Sangi Elementary student murder,
and the Daepyeong Reservoir case.

71
00:11:49,959 --> 00:11:53,212
She was also the first to find the body
in the Mt. Jugyeong water tank.

72
00:11:53,921 --> 00:11:58,843
because she kept finding perps and bodies
like the "It" in kids' games.

73
00:11:59,427 --> 00:12:02,763
How did such a hotshot
end up all the way out here?

74
00:12:02,847 --> 00:12:03,723
I don't know.

75
00:12:04,807 --> 00:12:07,727
What I do know is
that she didn't get ousted or anything.

76
00:12:07,810 --> 00:12:09,061
She chose to come here.

77
00:12:16,736 --> 00:12:17,945
They are coming out!

78
00:12:18,738 --> 00:12:20,072
Move over, please.

79
00:12:20,156 --> 00:12:21,699
JULY 2001, MY FIRST CASE

80
00:12:21,782 --> 00:12:23,325
Step aside, please.

81
00:12:23,909 --> 00:12:25,619
-Out of the way.
-Hold up!

82
00:12:25,703 --> 00:12:28,789
Just a minute! Hey, don't push!

83
00:12:29,290 --> 00:12:31,876
Come on, just a few shots!

84
00:12:32,376 --> 00:12:35,463
Sir, we'd like you
to provide a witness statement.

85
00:12:35,546 --> 00:12:38,090
Come to the station with us.
You too, ma'am.

86
00:13:06,869 --> 00:13:07,787
You okay?

87
00:13:07,870 --> 00:13:08,954
Are you all right?

88
00:13:16,796 --> 00:13:18,631
Should I take her to the hospital first?

89
00:13:20,132 --> 00:13:21,300
Just take her home.

90
00:13:22,468 --> 00:13:23,302
Let's go.

91
00:13:29,850 --> 00:13:32,436
Have you ever had a guest
clean up after themselves?

92
00:13:32,937 --> 00:13:34,480
How much cleaning do you mean?

93
00:13:36,232 --> 00:13:37,149
The bathroom.

94
00:13:37,650 --> 00:13:38,484
The bathroom?

95
00:13:39,902 --> 00:13:42,822
I've had people who made the bed
or tidied up the living room,

96
00:13:42,905 --> 00:13:45,241
but not once have I seen a clean bathroom.

97
00:13:46,158 --> 00:13:49,995
It depends on the person.
There are all kinds of people.

98
00:13:56,752 --> 00:13:57,586
Man!

99
00:13:59,755 --> 00:14:01,715
I wasn't expecting the repairman to come.

100
00:14:01,799 --> 00:14:03,092
It's all right.

101
00:14:03,175 --> 00:14:04,802
They said it would take two weeks.

102
00:14:05,594 --> 00:14:07,555
Sorry to make you clean up by yourself.

103
00:14:09,515 --> 00:14:11,767
Leave the pool. I'll take care of it.

104
00:14:13,435 --> 00:14:15,437
Darn it!

105
00:14:15,521 --> 00:14:17,773
Let me use the bathroom real quick.

106
00:16:21,230 --> 00:16:22,314
Hi.

107
00:16:23,899 --> 00:16:25,234
Your big sister is asleep.

108
00:16:27,653 --> 00:16:29,238
It's been a crazy day, huh?

109
00:16:31,490 --> 00:16:32,491
Is Gi-ho asleep?

110
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:38,914
Hey, Dad.

111
00:16:39,415 --> 00:16:41,625
My boy. You're not in bed yet?

112
00:16:42,668 --> 00:16:44,503
Stay with your aunt for a few more days.

113
00:16:45,587 --> 00:16:50,175
Mom and Dad have a few things
to take care of at home, okay?

114
00:16:51,135 --> 00:16:51,969
Okay.

115
00:16:53,345 --> 00:16:55,514
Why do you sound so down, sport?

116
00:16:56,432 --> 00:16:57,516
Go to bed now.

117
00:16:58,308 --> 00:16:59,643
I'll call again soon.

118
00:17:01,270 --> 00:17:02,104
Okay.

119
00:17:10,362 --> 00:17:11,447
Hey, stop.

120
00:17:12,489 --> 00:17:13,532
I'm fine.

121
00:17:13,615 --> 00:17:15,284
Stop drinking so damn much.

122
00:17:16,368 --> 00:17:17,327
Damn it.

123
00:17:59,953 --> 00:18:01,538
Want my help with the spoon?

124
00:18:05,042 --> 00:18:07,795
Want me to shove the food
down your throat?

125
00:18:16,011 --> 00:18:17,221
I insisted he stay.

126
00:18:18,097 --> 00:18:18,972
What do you mean?

127
00:18:22,476 --> 00:18:24,103
He seemed to be hesitating.

128
00:18:49,670 --> 00:18:50,587
Hi there!

129
00:18:52,756 --> 00:18:54,091
I told him to stay the night

130
00:18:55,217 --> 00:18:56,468
because of the rain.

131
00:18:59,346 --> 00:19:00,430
He looked tired.

132
00:19:01,390 --> 00:19:02,558
I bet he was damn tired.

133
00:19:04,101 --> 00:19:05,269
Right?

134
00:19:07,479 --> 00:19:09,565
I even gave him our best room.

135
00:19:11,316 --> 00:19:12,734
How is that your fault?

136
00:19:15,821 --> 00:19:18,157
What do you think
will happen to the motel?

137
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:20,075
Dude, don't worry about it.

138
00:19:21,285 --> 00:19:24,413
All sorts of shit goes down
in nightclubs and bars every night,

139
00:19:24,496 --> 00:19:27,833
but they open up for business
the next day with no problem.

140
00:19:27,916 --> 00:19:29,668
Everything will be fine.

141
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:32,856
Si-hyeon.

142
00:20:34,566 --> 00:20:36,109
I told you to stay still.

143
00:20:57,256 --> 00:21:02,177
POLICE

144
00:21:05,013 --> 00:21:08,392
"Perhaps what I'm imagining
is utterly ridiculous."

145
00:21:11,061 --> 00:21:14,648
"If I were to say out loud
what I'm imagining…"

146
00:21:31,331 --> 00:21:32,332
"If I did,

147
00:21:33,917 --> 00:21:35,294
what would happen?"

148
00:21:41,008 --> 00:21:43,051
I decided to stop imagining things.

149
00:21:45,554 --> 00:21:46,972
I just carried on as usual…

150
00:21:49,224 --> 00:21:51,101
and did what I'd always done.

151
00:22:18,628 --> 00:22:19,463
Oh no.

152
00:22:20,172 --> 00:22:22,966
You should've called.
Sorry I made you come here.

153
00:22:23,550 --> 00:22:24,551
Can you rush this?

154
00:22:25,677 --> 00:22:26,595
Are you booked?

155
00:22:28,764 --> 00:22:30,515
My daughter might be visiting soon.

156
00:22:30,599 --> 00:22:33,310
Then I'll take care of these
as soon as I can.

157
00:22:44,529 --> 00:22:45,364
Yeong-ha.

158
00:22:46,907 --> 00:22:48,408
You're missing a few towels.

159
00:22:50,202 --> 00:22:51,036
What?

160
00:22:51,745 --> 00:22:53,205
You always bring ten.

161
00:22:53,288 --> 00:22:55,415
Two, four, six. There are eight in here.

162
00:22:56,208 --> 00:22:58,043
You left two behind somewhere.

163
00:24:32,637 --> 00:24:33,638
Hello?

164
00:24:43,482 --> 00:24:44,816
This is the police.

165
00:24:47,486 --> 00:24:48,820
Is anybody home?

166
00:24:55,744 --> 00:24:56,745
Hello?

167
00:25:00,165 --> 00:25:01,333
This is the police.

168
00:25:30,195 --> 00:25:31,363
Thank you.

169
00:25:37,202 --> 00:25:40,121
I didn't have any business cards
with me yesterday.

170
00:25:43,375 --> 00:25:45,877
I'm Yoon Bo-min.
I work at the Hosu Police Station.

171
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:50,590
So you run a vacation rental.

172
00:26:09,150 --> 00:26:10,151
By the way…

173
00:26:12,737 --> 00:26:14,614
you're not feeling unwell, are you?

174
00:26:22,414 --> 00:26:23,331
I'm fine.

175
00:26:24,165 --> 00:26:25,333
Glad to hear that.

176
00:26:27,586 --> 00:26:29,504
I should get going now.

177
00:26:33,758 --> 00:26:35,010
Thanks for the water.

178
00:26:48,773 --> 00:26:50,400
You've got a lovely place.

179
00:26:52,360 --> 00:26:54,029
Maybe I'll book a stay here.

180
00:26:57,866 --> 00:26:59,242
Anything you'd like to say?

181
00:27:00,910 --> 00:27:01,745
No, ma'am.

182
00:28:44,931 --> 00:28:45,807
Hey!

183
00:28:46,307 --> 00:28:47,475
Excuse me!

184
00:28:48,268 --> 00:28:50,520
Mr. Ji Hyang-cheol!

185
00:29:59,005 --> 00:30:00,340
Here comes the stew!

186
00:30:00,423 --> 00:30:03,259
-Move that. It's hot!
-Put it down here.

187
00:30:03,343 --> 00:30:05,178
-Come sit.
-It's ready to eat.

188
00:30:05,762 --> 00:30:08,056
Come here. Have a glass!

189
00:30:08,139 --> 00:30:09,390
Help yourself.

190
00:30:09,474 --> 00:30:11,893
-Let's make a toast.
-Here, have some.

191
00:30:12,811 --> 00:30:14,729
-Cheers.
-To our vacation rentals!

192
00:30:14,813 --> 00:30:15,980
Cheers!

193
00:30:20,360 --> 00:30:21,486
So refreshing.

194
00:30:21,569 --> 00:30:23,071
There's nothing like it.

195
00:30:23,571 --> 00:30:26,407
"Who will come knocking
on the door of my destiny?"

196
00:30:28,243 --> 00:30:29,410
"The police?"

197
00:30:33,832 --> 00:30:35,208
"Or that murderer?"

198
00:30:54,227 --> 00:30:56,062
But even as the seasons changed,

199
00:30:56,855 --> 00:30:58,314
neither came to see me.

200
00:31:01,067 --> 00:31:04,571
By then, I couldn't even remember
what the woman looked like.

201
00:31:09,701 --> 00:31:12,871
I started to think
that day was just my delusion…

202
00:31:14,873 --> 00:31:18,459
that it… was all just a dream.

203
00:31:20,378 --> 00:31:22,213
Day in, day out, that's how I lived…

204
00:31:24,215 --> 00:31:26,301
clinging to hope in the worst way.

205
00:31:37,645 --> 00:31:38,980
-Let's go!
-Okay.

206
00:31:51,242 --> 00:31:52,744
"Clinging to hope in the worst way."

207
00:31:53,411 --> 00:31:54,245
Enjoy.

208
00:31:54,329 --> 00:31:56,915
Then I guess I can say…

209
00:31:56,998 --> 00:31:58,708
Eun-gyeong! We have a delivery.

210
00:31:58,791 --> 00:31:59,709
Okay.

211
00:32:00,919 --> 00:32:03,504
…that I lived in despair
in the best way I could.

212
00:32:12,931 --> 00:32:14,766
Gi-ho, I'm home!

213
00:32:17,936 --> 00:32:18,937
Koo Gi-ho.

214
00:32:21,189 --> 00:32:22,357
That rascal…

215
00:32:51,844 --> 00:32:53,596
SANG-JUN

216
00:33:42,770 --> 00:33:44,355
This is Lake View Motel.

217
00:33:44,439 --> 00:33:47,150
-Someone picked up.
-Is this Ji Hyang-cheol Motel?

218
00:33:47,233 --> 00:33:48,901
No, it's Murder Motel!

219
00:33:50,903 --> 00:33:53,072
Murder Motel? That's scary as shit!

220
00:34:02,415 --> 00:34:03,249
Eun-gyeong.

221
00:34:05,710 --> 00:34:07,962
Don't go over there. Leave them alone!

222
00:34:09,047 --> 00:34:10,465
Go back to the store!

223
00:34:11,132 --> 00:34:13,134
-You really shouldn't--
-Just go!

224
00:34:13,217 --> 00:34:14,552
Hurry up!

225
00:34:29,859 --> 00:34:31,277
What did you just say?

226
00:34:34,697 --> 00:34:35,823
Let's close the motel.

227
00:34:43,164 --> 00:34:44,665
It's been six months.

228
00:34:46,834 --> 00:34:48,419
Let's just sell it and…

229
00:34:55,343 --> 00:34:56,344
Eun-gyeong.

230
00:35:02,266 --> 00:35:03,518
Eun-gyeong!

231
00:35:05,186 --> 00:35:08,856
Gi-ho will be starting middle school soon,
and we have no income, nothing.

232
00:35:11,192 --> 00:35:12,777
That's why we're working hard.

233
00:35:12,860 --> 00:35:15,196
My pay barely covers our living expenses.

234
00:35:15,279 --> 00:35:17,031
We also have debt from the motel.

235
00:35:17,657 --> 00:35:20,326
And that petty cash you earn
doesn't really help.

236
00:35:22,495 --> 00:35:24,747
What? Did I hurt your pride?

237
00:35:26,457 --> 00:35:27,875
I threw mine away already.

238
00:35:29,043 --> 00:35:32,797
People who come to the restaurant
still talk about us behind my back.

239
00:35:34,215 --> 00:35:36,968
So did the other moms
when I first went to Gi-ho's school.

240
00:35:41,931 --> 00:35:43,516
-Eun-gyeong.
-Sang-jun.

241
00:35:44,308 --> 00:35:47,478
I'm not putting up with all this
just to sell that place dirt cheap.

242
00:35:50,731 --> 00:35:53,943
-Oh dear, what do we do?
-Goddamn it.

243
00:35:57,530 --> 00:35:59,699
What's he done wrong?

244
00:35:59,782 --> 00:36:02,076
What's he done to deserve all that shit?

245
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:03,661
Seriously, answer me.

246
00:36:03,744 --> 00:36:06,038
Does it feel good to throw shade at him?

247
00:36:06,122 --> 00:36:09,584
You asshole! How dare you!
This is between me and Eun-gyeong!

248
00:36:09,667 --> 00:36:11,919
You stupid motherfucker!

249
00:36:12,003 --> 00:36:13,087
What's wrong with you?

250
00:36:13,171 --> 00:36:15,381
-Dang!
-Don't do this!

251
00:36:15,464 --> 00:36:17,842
-Stop it! I will beat you!
-Let go!

252
00:36:17,925 --> 00:36:20,553
Oh my Lord!

253
00:36:20,636 --> 00:36:22,138
-Damn it!
-Bastard!

254
00:36:22,680 --> 00:36:24,724
-Ma'am!
-Shit.

255
00:36:24,807 --> 00:36:26,058
Are you okay?

256
00:36:26,684 --> 00:36:28,978
-Damn it!
-Hey, I'm fine.

257
00:36:29,061 --> 00:36:30,730
Just pathetic.

258
00:36:32,231 --> 00:36:33,149
Sang-jun.

259
00:36:33,232 --> 00:36:35,651
Stop it now, okay?

260
00:36:36,694 --> 00:36:38,112
Please stop.

261
00:36:38,196 --> 00:36:39,780
Sang-jun!

262
00:36:40,531 --> 00:36:41,365
Sang-jun…

263
00:36:43,284 --> 00:36:46,454
Fine! It's all my fault! Okay?

264
00:36:46,537 --> 00:36:48,456
Want me to apologize for everything?

265
00:36:48,539 --> 00:36:52,126
I should never have invited
that murderer that day, isn't that right?

266
00:36:52,210 --> 00:36:55,838
No, I shouldn't have opened
that stinkin' motel in the first place.

267
00:36:56,464 --> 00:36:57,298
Right?

268
00:36:57,798 --> 00:37:00,051
Should I apologize
for bringing you to this town?

269
00:37:00,134 --> 00:37:02,511
Or asking you to marry me
in the first place?

270
00:37:03,137 --> 00:37:05,765
What is it that you think
I've done so wrong?

271
00:37:11,896 --> 00:37:13,731
You're so cruel, you know that?

272
00:37:15,316 --> 00:37:18,653
You're not the only one…
who's struggling here.

273
00:37:19,695 --> 00:37:22,156
I'm struggling too. I'm so--

274
00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:23,157
Are you done?

275
00:37:37,338 --> 00:37:38,506
Fuck.

276
00:37:48,349 --> 00:37:50,184
Damn this fucking motel.

277
00:38:04,949 --> 00:38:05,783
Fuck!

278
00:38:26,762 --> 00:38:28,764
What the fuck do you want?

279
00:38:31,142 --> 00:38:32,226
Sang-jun.

280
00:38:32,310 --> 00:38:34,895
Fuck. Fuck this shit.

281
00:38:49,702 --> 00:38:50,536
Fuck!

282
00:39:53,265 --> 00:39:56,102
-Sang-jun.
-Get it off! I have to get it off!

283
00:39:56,727 --> 00:39:58,687
Let go of me, you bastard!

284
00:39:58,771 --> 00:40:01,524
Don't! Stop it, you moron!

285
00:40:02,900 --> 00:40:05,403
I need to get it off!

286
00:40:09,073 --> 00:40:10,908
Stop it, moron.

287
00:40:13,369 --> 00:40:15,621
Okay, I get it, you son of a bitch!

288
00:40:18,290 --> 00:40:19,542
Sang-jun.

289
00:40:42,773 --> 00:40:45,025
The motel ended up getting shut down…

290
00:40:45,109 --> 00:40:46,735
DECLARATION OF BUSINESS CLOSURE

291
00:40:46,819 --> 00:40:49,989
not even a year
after the Ji Hyang-cheol case.

292
00:40:52,032 --> 00:40:53,117
Good work, sir.

293
00:40:53,200 --> 00:40:55,202
You too. Good work, everyone.

294
00:40:55,286 --> 00:40:56,287
Thank you, sir.

295
00:41:02,001 --> 00:41:03,752
JI HYANG-CHEOL SENTENCED TO DEATH

296
00:41:03,836 --> 00:41:05,671
COURT RULES
HE MUST BE PERMANENTLY ISOLATED

297
00:41:18,893 --> 00:41:20,311
ONE YEAR SINCE JI'S ARREST

298
00:41:41,499 --> 00:41:43,501
Hey, let's get lunch first.

299
00:41:44,752 --> 00:41:45,586
Yes, sir.

300
00:41:46,212 --> 00:41:47,630
How about buckwheat noodles?

301
00:41:47,713 --> 00:41:49,715
-Sure, it sounds nice and cold.
-Okay.

302
00:41:49,798 --> 00:41:50,966
Let's go, Yoon.

303
00:42:21,997 --> 00:42:25,501
No one has expressed interest
in buying the place yet.

304
00:42:26,085 --> 00:42:27,378
Let's wait patiently.

305
00:42:28,128 --> 00:42:30,214
I've been a realtor for a long time,

306
00:42:30,297 --> 00:42:33,926
and I've learned that
every property eventually finds its owner.

307
00:42:35,219 --> 00:42:36,053
Right.

308
00:42:40,724 --> 00:42:41,976
Welcome!

309
00:42:42,726 --> 00:42:44,895
-Welco…
-I'm starving.

310
00:42:49,024 --> 00:42:50,192
Isn't that Gi-ho's mom?

311
00:42:50,276 --> 00:42:53,445
I heard the motel closed down.
She must be working here now.

312
00:42:57,366 --> 00:42:58,200
Hey, new guy!

313
00:42:58,701 --> 00:42:59,868
Coming!

314
00:43:07,751 --> 00:43:08,586
Yep!

315
00:43:24,935 --> 00:43:28,564
This will change. Then what happens?
The numerator will become one.

316
00:43:28,647 --> 00:43:31,442
Now, let's summarize this equation.

317
00:43:31,942 --> 00:43:36,572
It's going to be x cubed times y over xy,

318
00:43:36,655 --> 00:43:42,119
plus 2x squared times y over xy…

319
00:43:45,623 --> 00:43:46,790
What are you doing?

320
00:43:48,500 --> 00:43:49,501
Sit back down.

321
00:43:54,381 --> 00:43:55,299
Focus, guys!

322
00:44:17,821 --> 00:44:21,617
10502 KOO GI-HO

323
00:44:42,805 --> 00:44:43,806
I can't wait.

324
00:44:43,889 --> 00:44:44,890
Looks nice.

325
00:44:44,973 --> 00:44:46,392
It's gonna be so fun.

326
00:44:48,185 --> 00:44:50,521
-Don't be late.
-Hey, let's go now.

327
00:44:50,604 --> 00:44:51,980
And don't forget the booze.

328
00:44:53,273 --> 00:44:55,442
-Can't wait.
-This is gonna be fun.

329
00:45:49,455 --> 00:45:50,539
We're back.

330
00:45:50,622 --> 00:45:52,291
-Hey.
-Thank you for your work.

331
00:45:53,500 --> 00:45:55,669
Are you seriously taking a nap right now?

332
00:45:56,378 --> 00:45:58,672
Let him sleep. He's had a rough night.

333
00:45:59,173 --> 00:46:00,758
Hello. How can I help you?

334
00:46:00,841 --> 00:46:03,010
I'm here to arrest you!

335
00:46:03,093 --> 00:46:05,679
Sleeping at work?
Are you serious? Get up now!

336
00:46:17,107 --> 00:46:19,610
Here we go.

337
00:46:51,433 --> 00:46:52,267
Mr. Jeon!

338
00:46:52,351 --> 00:46:54,269
Hi. Are you almost here?

339
00:46:54,770 --> 00:46:57,022
Dad, we'll be there in about 30 minutes.

340
00:46:57,105 --> 00:46:58,065
Okay.

341
00:46:58,690 --> 00:47:00,818
Make sure his parents have a safe trip.

342
00:47:02,069 --> 00:47:06,657
As for dinner,
would they prefer barbecue or raw fish?

343
00:47:06,740 --> 00:47:08,158
They like all kinds of food.

344
00:47:08,242 --> 00:47:09,243
Relax, Dad!

345
00:47:09,910 --> 00:47:13,163
Don't lift a finger, sir.
We'll prep everything when we get there.

346
00:47:13,705 --> 00:47:15,332
-Drive safe.
-Okay.

347
00:47:15,415 --> 00:47:16,250
Bye.

348
00:48:07,968 --> 00:48:08,969
Air con.

349
00:48:30,657 --> 00:48:33,327
Temperature set to 22 degrees Celsius.

350
00:48:37,831 --> 00:48:39,416
They said it'd be 30 minutes.

351
00:48:40,083 --> 00:48:42,002
Wow, that was quick.

352
00:49:33,720 --> 00:49:34,638
Can…

353
00:49:39,643 --> 00:49:40,936
Can I help you?
