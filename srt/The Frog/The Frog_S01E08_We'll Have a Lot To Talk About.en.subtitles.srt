1
00:00:13,763 --> 00:00:15,932
She was going to bury something
at the rental.

2
00:00:17,434 --> 00:00:18,435
She might have…

3
00:00:20,437 --> 00:00:21,813
killed somebody.

4
00:00:50,300 --> 00:00:51,926
Did you send a text message

5
00:00:52,010 --> 00:00:54,846
to Ms. Jeon Ui-seon
from Mr. Park Yong-chae's phone?

6
00:01:01,311 --> 00:01:04,314
You've had disputes
with the rental owner, haven't you?

7
00:01:06,524 --> 00:01:07,901
Is that why you lured his daughter?

8
00:01:10,779 --> 00:01:14,032
Did you assault Ms. Jeon Ui-seon
and take her to the reservoir?

9
00:01:37,097 --> 00:01:38,598
I wonder who she killed.

10
00:01:40,850 --> 00:01:42,435
Where could the body be?

11
00:01:44,771 --> 00:01:46,356
What are you on about?

12
00:01:46,439 --> 00:01:47,440
Shut your mouth.

13
00:01:49,359 --> 00:01:52,946
If I could send you to jail for this,
there would be no crime in this world.

14
00:01:54,864 --> 00:01:56,449
Stabbing and locking up a man?

15
00:01:58,535 --> 00:02:01,538
You'll claim
it was mutual assault or self-defense.

16
00:02:03,456 --> 00:02:07,460
You stole a cell phone and used it
to lure a pregnant woman and attack her.

17
00:02:08,211 --> 00:02:09,212
She was pregnant?

18
00:02:11,881 --> 00:02:14,634
I bet you would've had more fun
if you'd known that before.

19
00:02:19,222 --> 00:02:21,432
You going to the reservoir? A coincidence.

20
00:02:22,809 --> 00:02:25,895
Running away from the police?
Because you got scared.

21
00:02:27,355 --> 00:02:28,606
There are many excuses.

22
00:02:28,690 --> 00:02:31,067
If you know that, why did you arrest me?

23
00:02:31,901 --> 00:02:33,736
If you keep your mouth shut,

24
00:02:34,571 --> 00:02:36,990
you'll probably walk out of here
with your lawyer.

25
00:02:37,699 --> 00:02:42,203
So… if you've done something
that's even more interesting than this,

26
00:02:42,912 --> 00:02:44,664
you better keep those lips sealed tight.

27
00:02:49,294 --> 00:02:51,462
That will make it even more fun for me.

28
00:02:52,797 --> 00:02:54,382
You're completely insane.

29
00:02:54,465 --> 00:02:56,217
I wonder who you've killed.

30
00:02:57,594 --> 00:02:58,887
Where could the body be?

31
00:03:00,513 --> 00:03:02,640
Oh, in the cornfield, perhaps?

32
00:03:19,115 --> 00:03:20,450
Don't say another word.

33
00:03:21,201 --> 00:03:22,619
Undo these cuffs now.

34
00:03:24,287 --> 00:03:27,957
Captain, we need to search
the Dosang-ri cornfield immediately.

35
00:03:48,561 --> 00:03:55,568
CHIEF'S OFFICE

36
00:04:05,662 --> 00:04:08,665
Nothing to worry about, sir.
Yes, have a good night.

37
00:04:13,253 --> 00:04:14,837
Un-fucking-believable.

38
00:04:14,921 --> 00:04:17,340
I've heard that you pull crazy stunts
every so often…

39
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:19,259
I need officers for a search.

40
00:04:24,681 --> 00:04:26,182
You rude little…

41
00:04:26,266 --> 00:04:28,268
She might have committed murder.

42
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:31,938
You're out of line, you know that?

43
00:04:32,021 --> 00:04:34,315
If you're wimping out,
at least let me do my job.

44
00:04:34,399 --> 00:04:35,233
Wimp out?

45
00:04:36,567 --> 00:04:39,070
Fuck, you better have a good reason
for your attitude.

46
00:04:58,965 --> 00:05:01,843
Yoo Seong-a was going to purchase
these items yesterday.

47
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:05,179
To me, they look useful
for getting rid of a body.

48
00:05:05,263 --> 00:05:07,390
She also said
she was going to bury something.

49
00:05:35,543 --> 00:05:36,377
Suit yourself.

50
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:42,425
But these are two different cases.

51
00:05:43,426 --> 00:05:46,137
Today's arrest
and the search you're requesting.

52
00:05:49,515 --> 00:05:51,809
Find the body first,
but you're on your own.

53
00:05:55,104 --> 00:05:57,440
If I don't find anything, I'll resign.

54
00:06:03,738 --> 00:06:05,907
Sure. You arrested her without a warrant.

55
00:06:05,990 --> 00:06:07,742
But what do you think will happen…

56
00:06:10,370 --> 00:06:14,624
if I find evidence that she's a murderer,
and you end up releasing her?

57
00:06:16,542 --> 00:06:19,670
If it's revealed you deemed this arrest
as a voluntary interview,

58
00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:23,216
citing its illegality
and muzzling your subordinates,

59
00:06:23,883 --> 00:06:25,885
and you let a murderer go free…

60
00:06:28,888 --> 00:06:30,765
guess who will end up resigning?

61
00:06:40,691 --> 00:06:41,692
Here she comes.

62
00:07:03,923 --> 00:07:04,757
Captain.

63
00:07:05,967 --> 00:07:10,888
I just turned over that strange footage
from the security camera to the police.

64
00:07:10,972 --> 00:07:13,433
I also grabbed the bloody shirt
with plastic gloves on,

65
00:07:13,516 --> 00:07:15,977
put them in a resealable bag,
and handed them over.

66
00:07:18,146 --> 00:07:19,897
That will help Yoo Seong-a.

67
00:07:19,981 --> 00:07:20,815
Sorry?

68
00:07:20,898 --> 00:07:24,902
She visited the ER the day before
after her ex-husband beat her.

69
00:07:26,112 --> 00:07:28,531
The blood on that shirt
is probably her own.

70
00:07:29,532 --> 00:07:32,994
Domestic abuse, psychiatric treatments,
history of mental illnesses…

71
00:07:33,828 --> 00:07:35,413
She'll use them to her advantage.

72
00:07:42,670 --> 00:07:44,755
Wait. But what does that--

73
00:07:46,048 --> 00:07:47,133
Shit, but…

74
00:07:49,969 --> 00:07:52,513
We performed emergency surgery
on the ruptured spleen.

75
00:07:53,014 --> 00:07:54,348
It went well.

76
00:07:54,432 --> 00:07:57,268
The cause of her unconsciousness
was found to be a drug.

77
00:07:57,351 --> 00:07:59,479
A slight delay,
and she would've gone into shock.

78
00:07:59,562 --> 00:08:00,730
Did you say a drug?

79
00:08:01,230 --> 00:08:03,816
Yes, but luckily, she vomited.

80
00:08:04,442 --> 00:08:07,528
I think she administered first aid
to herself before fainting.

81
00:08:07,612 --> 00:08:09,780
That's how the baby managed to survive.

82
00:08:10,281 --> 00:08:11,115
Thank you.

83
00:08:16,078 --> 00:08:17,747
Could you tell me what drug it was?

84
00:08:25,004 --> 00:08:26,005
She's asleep.

85
00:08:26,589 --> 00:08:27,673
-Go on in.
-Okay.

86
00:09:39,620 --> 00:09:40,788
-Hey.
-Yeong-ha!

87
00:09:40,871 --> 00:09:42,415
This doesn't make any sense.

88
00:09:42,915 --> 00:09:45,585
They're letting that nutjob
walk out of here.

89
00:10:03,561 --> 00:10:07,732
Dr. Yoo's been busy this morning.
He wanted you out by any means possible.

90
00:10:07,815 --> 00:10:08,899
As he should.

91
00:10:09,734 --> 00:10:12,069
What about my passport? Did you bring it?

92
00:10:12,570 --> 00:10:15,865
I told you to get it from the rental
so I can go straight to the airport.

93
00:10:15,948 --> 00:10:17,033
I was rushing over to--

94
00:10:17,116 --> 00:10:19,368
Yeah, right.
You fucking crawled your way here.

95
00:10:19,452 --> 00:10:21,203
Come with me to Seoul right away.

96
00:10:22,955 --> 00:10:25,458
Your father said
this was your final chance.

97
00:10:27,627 --> 00:10:29,629
Maybe I should report that woman.

98
00:10:31,213 --> 00:10:33,049
She had me cuffed for two hours.

99
00:10:34,634 --> 00:10:36,677
File the suit
and report to me once it's done.

100
00:11:25,559 --> 00:11:27,478
-Mr. Jeon.
-She was released?

101
00:11:27,978 --> 00:11:30,981
How can someone be released
a mere two hours after being arrested?

102
00:11:35,361 --> 00:11:36,654
We will catch her again.

103
00:11:36,737 --> 00:11:38,489
My daughter nearly died!

104
00:11:39,532 --> 00:11:41,450
My family nearly died!

105
00:11:42,284 --> 00:11:43,953
How could she get away with that?

106
00:11:46,330 --> 00:11:47,998
Where is that woman right now?

107
00:11:48,082 --> 00:11:53,170
What she planned to bury at your house…
I'm going to find it no matter what.

108
00:11:56,549 --> 00:11:57,550
I'll be leaving.

109
00:12:00,553 --> 00:12:01,679
I'll be leaving tomorrow.

110
00:12:04,890 --> 00:12:06,475
I don't have time for that now.

111
00:12:06,559 --> 00:12:07,560
Mr. Jeon.

112
00:12:08,436 --> 00:12:09,854
I don't care anymore.

113
00:12:19,989 --> 00:12:20,823
Let's begin.

114
00:12:22,158 --> 00:12:24,076
Start at the entrance. Single file.

115
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:25,494
-Get moving.
-Yes, sir!

116
00:14:16,689 --> 00:14:17,773
Captain!

117
00:14:19,483 --> 00:14:20,985
We'll look on this side!

118
00:15:38,646 --> 00:15:39,647
Here!

119
00:15:40,606 --> 00:15:41,440
Over here!

120
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:10,844
That's…

121
00:16:12,972 --> 00:16:13,806
Seon-tae…

122
00:16:14,890 --> 00:16:15,724
What?

123
00:17:08,944 --> 00:17:09,778
That's our…

124
00:17:12,656 --> 00:17:13,490
Seon-tae.

125
00:17:16,493 --> 00:17:17,661
Officer Kim.

126
00:17:19,788 --> 00:17:20,622
Officer Kim!

127
00:17:22,624 --> 00:17:23,542
Officer Kim?

128
00:17:26,545 --> 00:17:27,379
Officer Kim…

129
00:17:30,549 --> 00:17:31,967
Officer Kim…

130
00:18:12,591 --> 00:18:13,425
Fire?

131
00:18:14,176 --> 00:18:15,094
Where?

132
00:18:16,887 --> 00:18:18,055
The laundromat?

133
00:18:19,473 --> 00:18:20,307
Okay.

134
00:18:29,399 --> 00:18:31,985
20 MISSED CALLS

135
00:19:05,435 --> 00:19:06,270
As for you…

136
00:19:08,230 --> 00:19:09,690
I'll see you when I get back.

137
00:19:52,858 --> 00:19:54,193
You thought the lawyer

138
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:56,612
was the only person

139
00:19:58,030 --> 00:19:58,947
your father sent?

140
00:20:04,745 --> 00:20:06,330
Dad sent you?

141
00:20:10,792 --> 00:20:12,711
He knows you want to kill me.

142
00:20:14,379 --> 00:20:15,631
And he sent you here?

143
00:20:18,926 --> 00:20:20,344
Don't bullshit me, asshole.

144
00:20:37,319 --> 00:20:39,404
He wanted you out by any means possible.

145
00:20:40,322 --> 00:20:42,491
Your father said
this was your final chance.

146
00:21:15,732 --> 00:21:17,442
SEONG-A

147
00:21:18,485 --> 00:21:19,903
Answer the damn phone!

148
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:25,075
Dad?

149
00:21:26,285 --> 00:21:28,203
Ha Jae-sik is right in front of me.

150
00:21:28,912 --> 00:21:34,001
But for the life of me…
I can't understand what the ass is saying.

151
00:21:35,502 --> 00:21:37,337
He said you sent him. What does he mean?

152
00:21:38,755 --> 00:21:40,757
This bastard is here to kill me.

153
00:21:42,801 --> 00:21:43,635
Hello?

154
00:21:45,971 --> 00:21:47,556
Say something!

155
00:21:52,477 --> 00:21:53,895
Did you really send him?

156
00:21:57,482 --> 00:21:59,818
Tell me it's not true,
you fucking son of a bitch!

157
00:22:06,158 --> 00:22:07,826
This is where I killed Si-hyeon.

158
00:22:11,997 --> 00:22:12,998
Shall we end this?

159
00:22:14,958 --> 00:22:15,876
Shoot me.

160
00:22:38,815 --> 00:22:40,859
Just when I was about to take the fall.

161
00:22:43,612 --> 00:22:46,948
Shoot that man first… and I'll tell you.

162
00:22:50,410 --> 00:22:53,413
The remains in the columbarium?
Those aren't Si-hyeon's.

163
00:22:55,540 --> 00:22:57,959
The cremated body.
I don't even know whose it is.

164
00:22:59,336 --> 00:23:01,505
I dumped Si-hyeon's body somewhere else.

165
00:23:02,547 --> 00:23:04,049
Somewhere only I know.

166
00:23:09,763 --> 00:23:11,598
Si-hyeon must be so lonely.

167
00:23:13,308 --> 00:23:15,560
His dad won't even come to see him.

168
00:23:16,561 --> 00:23:18,230
All by himself in that icy water.

169
00:23:21,274 --> 00:23:22,401
Or was it underground?

170
00:23:26,947 --> 00:23:27,948
Where did you put him?

171
00:23:29,574 --> 00:23:31,701
I just think it's unfair to die alone.

172
00:23:32,994 --> 00:23:34,663
That bastard was my accomplice.

173
00:23:35,580 --> 00:23:37,916
We killed your son together right here.

174
00:23:41,336 --> 00:23:42,504
I told you, didn't I?

175
00:23:45,340 --> 00:23:46,925
That I'd see this through to the end.

176
00:23:51,346 --> 00:23:52,681
Come on, say something.

177
00:23:53,765 --> 00:23:54,975
Cat got your tongue?

178
00:24:08,655 --> 00:24:09,573
I'm sorry.

179
00:24:11,408 --> 00:24:12,242
See?

180
00:24:13,618 --> 00:24:14,453
For what?

181
00:24:20,083 --> 00:24:21,251
What are you sorry for?

182
00:24:24,254 --> 00:24:25,839
For letting Si-hyeon die alone.

183
00:24:28,300 --> 00:24:31,178
It's unbearable to see
my own child suffering and in pain.

184
00:24:33,805 --> 00:24:35,557
But Si-hyeon wasn't my child…

185
00:24:37,642 --> 00:24:41,146
so I thought,
"I might be wrong. He might be okay."

186
00:24:42,481 --> 00:24:44,149
"I'm sure he's alive and well."

187
00:24:45,484 --> 00:24:46,985
"I bet he's doing fine."

188
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:52,324
"I should carry on with my life,
and everything will just be okay."

189
00:24:57,162 --> 00:24:57,996
Your child

190
00:24:59,498 --> 00:25:00,999
died in this house.

191
00:25:03,210 --> 00:25:04,711
I knew it…

192
00:25:07,088 --> 00:25:08,340
and chose to cover it up.

193
00:25:14,930 --> 00:25:15,764
I'm sorry.

194
00:26:05,313 --> 00:26:06,565
You sons of bitches.

195
00:26:17,909 --> 00:26:19,077
You're so pitiful.

196
00:26:27,836 --> 00:26:28,753
If I die,

197
00:26:30,505 --> 00:26:32,591
I'm going to find your kid first

198
00:26:33,758 --> 00:26:36,261
so I can kill him all over again,

199
00:26:36,761 --> 00:26:39,097
and again, and again, and again.

200
00:26:45,937 --> 00:26:47,772
I thought about why you did this.

201
00:26:49,608 --> 00:26:51,568
I could only think of one reason.

202
00:26:53,028 --> 00:26:55,030
You were waiting for me

203
00:26:56,156 --> 00:26:59,075
to end your miserable existence.

204
00:27:03,371 --> 00:27:05,165
I'll make your wish come true.

205
00:27:13,006 --> 00:27:14,007
Drop your weapon!

206
00:27:38,365 --> 00:27:39,532
Are you okay?

207
00:27:39,616 --> 00:27:40,450
Drop it.

208
00:27:47,832 --> 00:27:49,334
Out of the way, Mr. Jeon.

209
00:27:50,126 --> 00:27:50,960
Don't shoot him.

210
00:27:52,796 --> 00:27:54,714
This man… Right now, he…

211
00:27:56,299 --> 00:27:57,342
No.

212
00:27:57,967 --> 00:27:59,552
You've got the wrong person.

213
00:28:01,262 --> 00:28:02,180
Don't shoot him.

214
00:28:03,264 --> 00:28:04,933
You're in harm's way. Move.

215
00:28:08,395 --> 00:28:09,729
We found the body.

216
00:28:23,034 --> 00:28:24,369
I don't know the details,

217
00:28:25,745 --> 00:28:27,455
but we have the same goal.

218
00:28:28,540 --> 00:28:29,874
Bringing that woman down.

219
00:28:31,126 --> 00:28:35,880
No matter what it takes,
I'm going to put her away for murder.

220
00:28:36,881 --> 00:28:38,299
So drop the gun.

221
00:28:39,300 --> 00:28:41,678
Mr. Jeon. Get back here.

222
00:28:44,222 --> 00:28:45,682
You drop your gun first.

223
00:28:52,772 --> 00:28:54,107
Drop it.

224
00:29:26,806 --> 00:29:28,141
That's when…

225
00:29:29,434 --> 00:29:30,935
Mr. Jeon!

226
00:29:32,604 --> 00:29:34,439
…everything went wrong.

227
00:30:01,382 --> 00:30:03,885
And I lost that woman.

228
00:32:09,594 --> 00:32:11,638
GAHYEON POLICE STATION
ROUTINE FIREARMS TRAINING

229
00:32:11,721 --> 00:32:13,097
AWARD OF EXCELLENCE
KIM SEON-TAE

230
00:32:21,439 --> 00:32:22,357
How are you doing?

231
00:32:26,277 --> 00:32:27,278
I'm bored.

232
00:32:28,529 --> 00:32:31,449
Come back to Violent Crimes
once you've recovered.

233
00:33:12,907 --> 00:33:14,409
Grandpa!

234
00:33:22,875 --> 00:33:24,460
Grandpa!

235
00:34:54,092 --> 00:34:55,259
What are you looking for?

236
00:34:56,677 --> 00:35:01,057
A torch or something
to melt the things that froze over.

237
00:35:02,725 --> 00:35:03,810
Hey, Yeong-ha.

238
00:35:04,310 --> 00:35:07,897
Haven't you ever had your pipes
or boiler freeze and burst?

239
00:35:11,651 --> 00:35:15,321
"Yeong-ha" is a homonym for "subzero,"
yet you know nothing about the cold.

240
00:35:16,781 --> 00:35:18,574
"Ha" means summer, that's why.

241
00:35:20,076 --> 00:35:21,786
Come outside. I called a contractor.

242
00:35:21,869 --> 00:35:22,703
What?

243
00:35:35,967 --> 00:35:37,468
Is that really necessary?

244
00:35:55,069 --> 00:35:57,405
Thanks for your help. Here's some tea.

245
00:35:58,573 --> 00:35:59,490
Thanks.

246
00:36:05,872 --> 00:36:09,792
You could've bought some antifreeze covers
at 2,000 won each to save money.

247
00:36:09,876 --> 00:36:11,752
Now it'll cost you ten times as much.

248
00:36:15,173 --> 00:36:17,300
Don't forget to use the covers next year.

249
00:36:21,929 --> 00:36:24,015
Look, it's snowing again.

250
00:36:27,101 --> 00:36:29,687
Seong-ran. Get your fill.

251
00:36:30,396 --> 00:36:32,023
I heard you wanted to see the snow.

252
00:36:32,982 --> 00:36:34,775
God, I'm so sick of the snow.

253
00:36:34,859 --> 00:36:37,445
Live on these hills long enough,
and you'll understand.

254
00:37:07,016 --> 00:37:08,559
You sure that'll cut it?

255
00:37:30,581 --> 00:37:31,415
Shit.

256
00:37:35,086 --> 00:37:36,337
Hey!

257
00:37:54,605 --> 00:37:55,439
Don't shoot!

258
00:39:46,300 --> 00:39:49,220
Is it nice,
living in Seoul with your daughter?

259
00:39:50,179 --> 00:39:52,848
It's too stifling.
And it only makes me gain weight.

260
00:39:55,309 --> 00:39:56,227
Anyway,

261
00:39:57,561 --> 00:40:00,898
there's so much… to fix in here.

262
00:40:01,399 --> 00:40:04,985
You have plenty of time.
Take it slow. Fix one thing at a time.

263
00:40:05,653 --> 00:40:09,407
-Like you did when you first came here.
-Take it slow? No way.

264
00:40:09,990 --> 00:40:11,075
I hired a contractor.

265
00:40:11,158 --> 00:40:12,535
Look who's all grown up.

266
00:40:27,591 --> 00:40:29,135
CHIEF DETECTIVE
YOON BO-MIN

267
00:40:57,246 --> 00:40:58,164
Thank you.

268
00:41:04,211 --> 00:41:06,630
My first workplace was right around here.

269
00:41:07,131 --> 00:41:08,632
I was driving through the area.

270
00:41:08,716 --> 00:41:11,552
Thought I'd check out the lake,
and I ended up getting lost.

271
00:41:13,304 --> 00:41:14,388
I see.

272
00:41:17,099 --> 00:41:18,350
So you're a writer?

273
00:41:30,571 --> 00:41:32,656
I had a picture I took at this motel too.

274
00:41:33,741 --> 00:41:34,825
I lost it though.

275
00:41:53,427 --> 00:41:55,513
JULY 2001, MY FIRST CASE

276
00:42:00,392 --> 00:42:01,227
Is this it?

277
00:42:04,605 --> 00:42:05,439
Yes.

278
00:42:10,361 --> 00:42:13,614
Kim Gyeong-ok was in the same room
as Ji Hyang-cheol's mother,

279
00:42:14,365 --> 00:42:15,741
and Park Jong-du was her son.

280
00:42:17,785 --> 00:42:21,872
I know his supermarket from 20 years ago,
so it was quite easy to figure out.

281
00:42:24,625 --> 00:42:27,044
There are times when no one wants

282
00:42:27,545 --> 00:42:29,547
the truth to be revealed.

283
00:42:33,551 --> 00:42:37,012
Ha Jae-sik, who shot Yoo Seong-a
at Mr. Jeon Yeong-ha's vacation rental,

284
00:42:37,596 --> 00:42:39,974
stayed silent about where he got the gun.

285
00:42:40,057 --> 00:42:41,016
JI HYANG-CHEOL

286
00:42:41,100 --> 00:42:45,062
Since the murder weapon couldn't be found,
the Ji Hyang-cheol case went cold.

287
00:42:53,237 --> 00:42:57,324
And Yoo Seong-a's father, who wanted
the whole thing to go away quietly…

288
00:42:59,493 --> 00:43:03,080
went as far as to defend
the man who killed his own daughter.

289
00:43:03,914 --> 00:43:05,916
Dr. Yoo sent me.

290
00:43:11,505 --> 00:43:13,340
I suppose Mr. Jeon,

291
00:43:13,424 --> 00:43:16,760
who alone knows the whole truth,
is keeping it to himself

292
00:43:17,595 --> 00:43:19,263
so he can protect someone.

293
00:43:27,855 --> 00:43:29,940
I guess you haven't seen him since then.

294
00:43:38,073 --> 00:43:39,533
Why are you covering this up?

295
00:43:44,872 --> 00:43:48,626
I don't want to go after the poor frog
after losing the real culprit.

296
00:43:52,671 --> 00:43:54,214
Besides, it's not my case.

297
00:43:58,427 --> 00:44:02,181
You should smile more. You have
the same look as when you were a kid.

298
00:45:17,047 --> 00:45:20,217
One iced Americano, one green grape soda,
and one sandwich.

299
00:45:20,300 --> 00:45:21,552
-Got it.
-Jeong-won.

300
00:45:21,635 --> 00:45:23,721
An Iced Americano and a green grape soda…

301
00:45:25,139 --> 00:45:26,140
Yeong-ha.

302
00:45:26,223 --> 00:45:27,975
-Hey!
-That's not green tea.

303
00:45:28,058 --> 00:45:29,893
-I'll have…
-One more iced Americano.

304
00:45:30,477 --> 00:45:32,312
And a green grape soda. Yes?

305
00:45:32,938 --> 00:45:34,898
Would you mind taking a picture for us?

306
00:45:34,982 --> 00:45:36,483
No, not at all!

307
00:45:38,736 --> 00:45:40,654
Wow, this place is bustling.

308
00:45:41,989 --> 00:45:44,199
I remember him closing
the laundromat immediately.

309
00:45:44,283 --> 00:45:46,368
Some are just
bound to be successful, right?

310
00:45:46,452 --> 00:45:49,121
He's like the boss of this town.
A future billionaire.

311
00:45:50,372 --> 00:45:52,207
Maybe we'll ride on his coattails?

312
00:45:55,252 --> 00:45:57,087
-Here you go.
-Thank you, sir.

313
00:45:57,171 --> 00:46:00,382
I saw you two laughing.
Making fun of me, were you?

314
00:46:01,842 --> 00:46:03,010
Are you coming tonight?

315
00:46:03,093 --> 00:46:05,179
For our get-together? You bet.

316
00:46:05,262 --> 00:46:06,096
One sec.

317
00:46:16,982 --> 00:46:18,484
Try it. It's pretty good.

318
00:46:20,527 --> 00:46:22,279
-Bon appétit.
-Thanks.

319
00:46:23,238 --> 00:46:25,157
Riding on his coattails already.

320
00:46:35,709 --> 00:46:36,543
Mr. Yong-chae!

321
00:46:37,336 --> 00:46:39,213
Hey! My doctor nephew-in-law!

322
00:46:39,797 --> 00:46:40,839
Hello.

323
00:46:49,681 --> 00:46:52,184
Grandpa's here! It's Grandpa.

324
00:46:52,851 --> 00:46:53,936
Hi, Grandpa!

325
00:46:57,064 --> 00:46:58,315
-Take these first.
-Sure.

326
00:47:03,821 --> 00:47:06,323
-Did you grab the corkscrew?
-Yes, I did.

327
00:47:35,269 --> 00:47:38,939
I'D LIKE TO BOOK YOUR VACATION RENTAL

328
00:47:46,363 --> 00:47:49,700
I'm sorry,
but we're no longer in business.

329
00:48:03,630 --> 00:48:04,464
Hello?

330
00:48:17,978 --> 00:48:21,315
I wanted to come see your place, Mister.

331
00:48:29,323 --> 00:48:30,282
I think…

332
00:48:32,242 --> 00:48:34,161
we'll have a lot to talk about.

333
00:48:53,931 --> 00:48:55,933
A giant tree fell in a forest…

334
00:48:59,186 --> 00:49:01,188
and no one was around to hear it.

335
00:49:37,724 --> 00:49:38,725
Did it

336
00:49:40,477 --> 00:49:42,062
make a sound…

337
00:49:45,816 --> 00:49:47,484
or was there nothing but silence?

338
00:49:52,197 --> 00:49:55,242
THE FROG
