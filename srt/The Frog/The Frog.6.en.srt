00:22:42,027 --> 00:22:43,278
[Yeong-ha] Ah, thank you.

190
00:22:49,701 --> 00:22:51,036
Was that your daughter?

191
00:22:51,661 --> 00:22:52,537
Yeah.

192
00:22:54,998 --> 00:22:56,541
That's nice that she calls.

193
00:22:57,834 --> 00:23:00,087
My son… I wish he would call.

194
00:23:04,174 --> 00:23:05,717
Are you not talking, or…

195
00:23:08,303 --> 00:23:09,805
He's staying at his aunt's.

196
00:23:10,514 --> 00:23:12,140
Well, for the time being, he is.

197
00:23:13,350 --> 00:23:15,268
But I can't find her number anymore.

198
00:23:15,936 --> 00:23:17,979
And now this thing with the motel…

199
00:23:18,063 --> 00:23:19,648
[mysterious music playing]

200
00:23:19,731 --> 00:23:20,941
What thing?

201
00:23:22,109 --> 00:23:23,151
The other day…

202
00:23:25,320 --> 00:23:27,364
a man, a psychopath, was there.

203
00:23:29,282 --> 00:23:30,283
The other day?

204
00:23:36,665 --> 00:23:37,958
Oh, about your son…

205
00:23:38,041 --> 00:23:40,961
Uh, um, how old is he now?

206
00:23:44,339 --> 00:23:45,632
He's 13 years old.

207
00:23:54,391 --> 00:23:56,017
I run a motel as well, actually.

208
00:23:56,726 --> 00:23:57,769
Oh yeah?

209
00:23:59,688 --> 00:24:00,689
And, um…

210
00:24:02,816 --> 00:24:04,109
a couple days ago…

211
00:24:06,570 --> 00:24:08,029
a psychopath showed up there.

212
00:24:09,823 --> 00:24:13,702
I haven't decided
what I'm going to do about it yet.

213
00:24:18,582 --> 00:24:20,083
[Sang-jun] Don't trust anyone.

214
00:24:22,169 --> 00:24:23,170
Be suspicious.

215
00:24:24,796 --> 00:24:29,217
Pe… people aren't
gonna be there when it counts.

216
00:24:30,427 --> 00:24:32,053
Like with Eun-gyeong and Gi-ho.

217
00:24:33,096 --> 00:24:35,348
They probably won't give you
a second thought.

218
00:24:40,103 --> 00:24:41,897
You wanna keep her safe, don't you?

219
00:24:44,191 --> 00:24:45,108
Uh, I…

220
00:24:46,151 --> 00:24:47,360
I… I mean your daughter.

Wait, wait. Hey, hey, hey!

223
00:25:09,132 --> 00:25:10,300
Do you want him dead?

224
00:25:11,134 --> 00:25:12,260
That psychopath?

225
00:25:13,011 --> 00:25:14,012
[Yeong-ha] What?

226
00:25:15,889 --> 00:25:17,432
I'm not supposed to tell.

227
00:25:19,226 --> 00:25:21,436
We're the same, though, so I gotta…

228
00:25:24,606 --> 00:25:26,316
I know a man who can help you out.

229
00:25:27,317 --> 00:25:28,860
Even if the psycho's in jail,

230
00:25:28,944 --> 00:25:30,904
he can get him to come out and kill him

231
00:25:31,655 --> 00:25:32,948
no matter where they are.

232
00:25:33,990 --> 00:25:35,951
He said there's lots of ways to do it.

233
00:25:36,034 --> 00:25:38,119
-What are you saying?
-"I'll kill him, Dad. I mean it."

234
00:25:38,745 --> 00:25:41,039
-What?
-"I'm gonna kill Ji Hyang-cheol."

[Yeong-ha] I wondered if you meant it.
Would you go that far?

255
00:27:39,157 --> 00:27:42,243
So I decided to see this motel story
to the end.

[music fades]

257
00:27:45,789 --> 00:27:48,667

say that from the start?

[Yeong-ha] I wasn't really
in a position to speak.

At your age, you're still…

313

What have you gotten yourself into?

314
00:32:59,477 --> 00:33:01,980
-You think I'll just let you do this, huh?
-You can't!

315
00:33:02,063 --> 00:33:05,066
You gotta keep this between us, huh?
I mean, Gi- ho's…

Sir, ma'am,
we'd really appreciate your cooperation.

00:33:11,406 --> 00:33:14,951
Right. Uh, a moment, yeah?
If you don't mind.

320
00:33:22,667 --> 00:33:24,752
[officer 1] In that case,
let's just let her stay.

Sir, if you wouldn't mind
stepping out for a moment…

322

Not a chance in hell.

-Sir?
-Uh…

324
00:33:31,843 --> 00:33:36,180
I'm not leaving her in this room
with… with some kind of psycho killer.

325
00:33:36,264 --> 00:33:38,725
-Sir, I'm not sure that you understand--
-I saw the guy.

326
00:33:39,642 --> 00:33:43,146
Not only that, I saw all the guards
and the security out there in the hall.

327
00:33:43,229 --> 00:33:44,355
She's my mother!

330
00:33:48,651 --> 00:33:50,611
I'm not proud of it,
but I've got a record.

331
00:33:50,695 --> 00:33:52,321
A criminal record, so I get it.

332
00:33:52,405 --> 00:33:54,699
But look at her. This is on you!

333
00:33:55,241 --> 00:33:58,161
Look at what you did!
Look how upset she is, and I'm wrong?

334
00:33:58,244 --> 00:34:00,997
You barge in here,
no explanation, and I'm wrong?

335
00:34:01,080 --> 00:34:02,832
You can't be serious right now!

336
00:34:02,915 --> 00:34:05,543
This is just in case of
any unforeseen circumstances.

337
00:34:05,626 --> 00:34:07,170
Unforeseen circumstances?

338
00:34:07,670 --> 00:34:08,671
Look here, okay?

339
00:34:11,299 --> 00:34:15,470
Let's draw this curtain
and this one like so.

340
00:34:15,553 --> 00:34:16,512
Oh, and this chair.

341
00:34:17,346 --> 00:34:19,057
He can sit right here, okay?

342
00:34:20,058 --> 00:34:22,602
He can just sit here, can't he? Huh?

345
00:34:49,629 --> 00:34:52,632
Uh, right. Sure thing, sir.
Let's do that. Now, if you would…

346
00:34:55,343 --> 00:34:57,261
Please, sir. If you wouldn't mind, uh…

00:35:11,192 --> 00:35:13,152
[Gi-ho] Make sure
you ditch the burner, okay?

350
00:35:13,236 --> 00:35:15,696
I'll give you a call later. Thank you.

351
00:35:16,405 --> 00:35:17,406

Here…

358
00:36:00,741 --> 00:36:03,411
She might be unconscious
and unable to recognize you,

359
00:36:03,494 --> 00:36:05,079
but this is your mother, you know?

360

Mom and Dad are working.

545
00:55:25,739 --> 00:55:27,532
But we'll get you soon, okay?

546
00:55:29,617 --> 00:55:30,702
I'm sorry.

547
00:55:32,245 --> 00:55:34,080
Once everything's taken care of,

548
00:55:35,040 --> 00:55:36,333
Dad's gonna…

549
00:55:42,756 --> 00:55:43,715
I'm gonna…

550
00:55:43,798 --> 00:55:45,300
[Sang-jun] You little shit! Come back!

551
00:55:45,383 --> 00:55:47,052
-Where are you going, huh?
-Honey, honey!

552
00:55:47,135 --> 00:55:48,553
[Sang-jun] Hey, Koo Gi-ho!

553
00:55:48,636 --> 00:55:51,389
[crying]

554
00:55:52,682 --> 00:55:54,434
[Sang-jun] You're right!
All of it is on me!

555
00:55:54,517 --> 00:55:57,479
So where do you want me to start?
Should I say "sorry" for bringing us here?

556
00:55:57,562 --> 00:55:59,898
Or even proposing to you,
what about that, huh?

557
00:56:00,440 --> 00:56:02,817
I mean, can you tell me
where I made a mistake, huh?

558
00:56:02,901 --> 00:56:04,235
[Eun-gyeong] Are you done?

559
00:56:08,615 --> 00:56:09,532
[sobs]

560
00:56:14,579 --> 00:56:15,622
I'm gonna…

561
00:56:20,418 --> 00:56:22,045
take care of everything…

562
00:56:25,048 --> 00:56:26,257
and get you, okay?

563
00:56:27,675 --> 00:56:28,885
So until then,

564
00:56:29,761 --> 00:56:31,721
I need you to stay strong, buddy.

565
00:56:32,597 --> 00:56:35,266
Your mom and dad miss you.
You know that, right?

566
00:56:42,732 --> 00:56:43,983
Why do you sound…

567
00:56:44,067 --> 00:56:46,236
why do you sound so down, champ?

568
00:56:47,487 --> 00:56:49,614
Hey, what was that thing again?

569
00:56:49,697 --> 00:56:52,534
Uh, that thing you wanted. The…

570
00:56:53,868 --> 00:56:55,703
Oh, the game!

571
00:56:56,704 --> 00:56:58,415
The game! [sobs]

572
00:56:59,374 --> 00:57:00,542
Of all the things…

573
00:57:01,835 --> 00:57:04,045
[Sang-jun] That… that game.

574
00:57:05,255 --> 00:57:06,881
Dad's gonna get it for you.

575
00:57:08,133 --> 00:57:09,300
[Sang-jun sobs]

576
00:57:09,384 --> 00:57:12,595
K… keep it a secret from Mom, okay?

577
00:57:13,888 --> 00:57:15,765
[sobbing]

578
00:57:17,183 --> 00:57:19,602
[Sang-jun crying]

579
00:57:25,233 --> 00:57:27,235
[crying continues]

580
00:57:34,242 --> 00:57:35,910
[wistful music continues]

581
00:57:48,298 --> 00:57:49,674
[music fades]

582
00:57:49,757 --> 00:57:52,051
[Gi-ho] When I heard
that he was writing a memoir,

583
00:57:53,178 --> 00:57:54,929
I got really pissed off.

584
00:57:57,265 --> 00:58:00,727
My mother… she's a victim of his too.

585
00:58:03,855 --> 00:58:04,772
And my dad,

586
00:58:06,441 --> 00:58:08,193
he's been stuck in that moment forever.

587
00:58:10,528 --> 00:58:11,946
So that's when I decided.

588
00:58:13,198 --> 00:58:16,326
I went to see him and said,
"I'd like to publish your memoir."

589
00:58:18,077 --> 00:58:20,330
He gave me his ghostwriter's address, but…

590
00:58:22,415 --> 00:58:24,751
[tender piano music playing]

591
00:58:24,834 --> 00:58:26,461
…he was already dead when I…

592
00:58:29,339 --> 00:58:31,090
Instead of calling it in, I…

593
00:58:33,426 --> 00:58:36,304
I just grabbed
all of his letters and writings and left.

594
00:58:40,934 --> 00:58:42,852
I just held up in this motel and…

595
00:58:44,979 --> 00:58:45,980
read everything.

596
00:58:46,981 --> 00:58:49,067
[sighs] Then I…

597
00:58:52,654 --> 00:58:54,822
After reading the memoir, I felt weird.

598
00:58:56,324 --> 00:58:57,408
It wasn't anger.

599
00:58:58,952 --> 00:59:00,578
I don't know what I was feeling.

600
00:59:05,750 --> 00:59:08,044
Ji Hyang-cheol was at peace

601
00:59:08,127 --> 00:59:10,630
and was ready to leave behind
the shit he created.

602
00:59:12,799 --> 00:59:13,716
I guess that

603
00:59:14,801 --> 00:59:17,845
enough time had passed
that he could look back and reflect.

604
00:59:19,722 --> 00:59:20,640
But I…

605
00:59:25,478 --> 00:59:27,313
came out here with his letters, and…

606
00:59:34,112 --> 00:59:36,364
I hadn't moved on at all.
That much was clear.

607
00:59:40,535 --> 00:59:42,537
[tender piano music continues]

608
01:00:04,559 --> 01:00:05,435
Give me those clothes.

609
01:00:08,062 --> 01:00:08,980
Take a shower.

610
01:00:11,774 --> 01:00:13,776
[tender piano music continues]

611
01:00:32,045 --> 01:00:34,047
[music fades]

612
01:00:58,988 --> 01:01:00,114
[Gi-ho] What are you doing?

613
01:01:02,742 --> 01:01:03,868
You and me were drinking.

614
01:01:04,869 --> 01:01:06,579
[uneasy music playing]

615
01:01:06,663 --> 01:01:08,164
You had this planned, right?

616
01:01:09,832 --> 01:01:11,209
You had an escape route.

617
01:01:13,336 --> 01:01:14,462
You even have

618
01:01:15,922 --> 01:01:16,964
an alibi.

619
01:01:18,675 --> 01:01:19,842
What?

620
01:01:23,805 --> 01:01:25,264
The empty cans in the sink.

621
01:01:27,350 --> 01:01:28,851
We both got blackout drunk.

622
01:01:30,144 --> 01:01:32,397
I came here to buy the motel off you.

623
01:01:33,815 --> 01:01:35,900
I got your information from the realtor.

624
01:01:37,110 --> 01:01:39,445
We met there,
came here, and started drinking.

625
01:01:41,447 --> 01:01:42,657
We partied all night.

626
01:01:45,368 --> 01:01:46,953
We woke up an hour ago.

627
01:01:49,997 --> 01:01:51,958
Wait. I thought I was gonna get arrested.

628
01:02:01,092 --> 01:02:02,635
Like I said, I'm not a cop.

629
01:02:04,011 --> 01:02:05,346
But you never said that.

630
01:02:14,188 --> 01:02:16,190
[music fades]

631
01:02:35,418 --> 01:02:36,836
[Yong-chae] Yeong-ha, where are you?

632
01:02:36,919 --> 01:02:39,547
I'm at your place right now.
Is that the woman who…

633
01:02:39,630 --> 01:02:40,882
YONG-CHAE

634
01:02:40,965 --> 01:02:41,966

640
01:03:22,590 --> 01:03:23,800
[woman] Hey, mister?

641
01:03:28,638 --> 01:03:29,680
Are you there?

642
01:03:30,932 --> 01:03:33,351
Hello!

643
01:03:33,434 --> 01:03:34,352

Hello, hello, hello!

646
01:03:39,065 --> 01:03:40,149
Are you there?

647
01:03:41,859 --> 01:03:42,944
When are you

648
01:03:44,111 --> 01:03:46,030
coming to the house again?

649
01:03:47,490 --> 01:03:49,033

[unsettling music playing]

654
01:04:02,922 --> 01:04:04,632
[Yeong-ha] That's when I realized…

655
01:04:12,640 --> 01:04:13,724
it didn't matter

656
01:04:14,684 --> 01:04:15,935
whether I came clean

657
01:04:17,395 --> 01:04:18,771
or covered it all up.

658
01:04:21,023 --> 01:04:23,025
[dramatic music playing]

659
01:04:27,488 --> 01:04:29,198
I had to protect what matters…

660
01:04:31,951 --> 01:04:33,160
to the bitter end.

661
