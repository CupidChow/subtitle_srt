1
00:00:29,195 --> 00:00:31,197
A giant tree fell in a forest…

2
00:00:52,135 --> 00:00:54,637
and no one was around to hear it.

3
00:01:05,356 --> 00:01:09,527
Did it make a sound,
or was there nothing but silence?

4
00:01:23,124 --> 00:01:28,963
THE FROG

5
00:02:03,706 --> 00:02:04,624
Oh no.

6
00:02:05,375 --> 00:02:07,043
Sorry I made you come here.

7
00:02:09,504 --> 00:02:11,005
I was on my way out anyway.

8
00:02:11,798 --> 00:02:13,216
Did your guests leave?

9
00:02:14,050 --> 00:02:14,884
Yeah.

10
00:02:17,762 --> 00:02:20,181
Oh boy, it's nice and cool in here.

11
00:02:22,809 --> 00:02:25,728
I have so much laundry coming in.
It's driving me mad.

12
00:02:25,812 --> 00:02:26,771
Thanks.

13
00:02:26,855 --> 00:02:29,566
Vacation rentals are thriving, I tell you!

14
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:32,735
I told my wife to leave Seoul
and move here,

15
00:02:32,819 --> 00:02:35,738
that this is more important
than our kid's education.

16
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:39,576
Sometimes, I just feel like
shutting down this laundromat

17
00:02:39,659 --> 00:02:42,328
and running a vacation rental
for easy money.

18
00:02:42,829 --> 00:02:45,957
Now, I'm not saying
that what you do is easy.

19
00:02:46,833 --> 00:02:48,960
You want these ready
for your next booking?

20
00:02:49,043 --> 00:02:50,670
-There is no booking.
-What?

21
00:02:54,007 --> 00:02:57,802
Well, it's not like you're doing this
just for the money.

22
00:02:57,886 --> 00:02:59,512
Do you think I'm running a charity?

23
00:03:02,390 --> 00:03:05,393
I'm messing with you.
Take your time with the laundry.

24
00:03:08,855 --> 00:03:09,856
Will do, sir.

25
00:03:12,150 --> 00:03:13,067
Oh God!

26
00:03:13,151 --> 00:03:14,861
Sorry I made you come here.

27
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:18,198
There.

28
00:03:19,949 --> 00:03:22,076
Hey, I heard you saw a wild boar.

29
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:23,036
I did.

30
00:03:23,119 --> 00:03:25,288
A wild boar? Not a water deer?

31
00:03:25,371 --> 00:03:27,624
You heard me. He saw a wild boar.

32
00:03:27,707 --> 00:03:29,584
But we've never seen one in this town.

33
00:03:29,667 --> 00:03:31,669
It must've crossed the mountain, then.

34
00:03:31,753 --> 00:03:35,548
What about your vacation rental?
Won't it be dangerous for you?

35
00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:38,218
Am I the only one in danger?

36
00:03:38,301 --> 00:03:40,720
Your place is the closest
to the mountain, so--

37
00:03:40,803 --> 00:03:42,889
Hey! Where's my coffee?

38
00:03:43,389 --> 00:03:44,390
Coming right up.

39
00:03:47,310 --> 00:03:49,479
I hate that kid harping on about money,

40
00:03:49,979 --> 00:03:52,232
saying this year's a busy one
when it's not.

41
00:03:53,358 --> 00:03:54,442
And he always goes,

42
00:03:54,525 --> 00:03:57,445
"Sorry I made you come for your laundry."

43
00:03:57,528 --> 00:03:58,738
He's not sorry!

44
00:04:00,573 --> 00:04:04,160
Anyway, stop exercising in the morning
until that boar is caught.

45
00:04:04,244 --> 00:04:06,120
As you wish.

46
00:04:06,746 --> 00:04:09,832
And don't open up the pool.
You'll get plenty of guests without it.

47
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:11,501
Fine, I won't.

48
00:04:12,001 --> 00:04:15,546
You have to clean it every day.
It's an awful lot of work.

49
00:04:15,630 --> 00:04:18,007
Some guests even want you
to refill it for them,

50
00:04:18,091 --> 00:04:19,300
which takes forever.

51
00:04:19,384 --> 00:04:23,054
And God forbid
a guest has an accident in the pool.

52
00:04:23,137 --> 00:04:24,222
If you have time,

53
00:04:24,305 --> 00:04:27,350
I suggest you set up
an online booking website instead.

54
00:04:32,605 --> 00:04:33,439
What?

55
00:04:34,315 --> 00:04:35,566
I'm gonna put those away.

56
00:04:37,610 --> 00:04:38,444
Why?

57
00:04:39,195 --> 00:04:41,114
You told me to close down the pool.

58
00:04:42,115 --> 00:04:44,367
-You'll make a website, then?
-Nope.

59
00:04:47,370 --> 00:04:50,039
-Are you shutting down the business?
-It's dangerous here.

60
00:04:50,540 --> 00:04:53,293
I shouldn't accept any guests
until that boar is caught.

61
00:04:56,379 --> 00:04:57,630
Fold this up and…

62
00:05:06,973 --> 00:05:08,599
Come on, already.

63
00:05:15,189 --> 00:05:16,441
-Run!
-Block them!

64
00:05:16,524 --> 00:05:18,359
Here! Pass to me!

65
00:05:21,029 --> 00:05:22,280
She's settled in already.

66
00:05:22,363 --> 00:05:23,448
Really?

67
00:05:23,531 --> 00:05:27,285
The girl who cried and kicked her mom,
refusing to move schools, is no more.

68
00:05:28,328 --> 00:05:31,831
Bustling around with her hair all messy,
she's quite a sight.

69
00:05:31,914 --> 00:05:34,500
My leave starts next week.
I'll be transferred right away.

70
00:05:35,001 --> 00:05:36,461
Is tomorrow your first day?

71
00:05:37,211 --> 00:05:38,046
Yup.

72
00:05:39,380 --> 00:05:40,506
Do you want an orchid?

73
00:05:41,007 --> 00:05:43,051
-An orchid?
-Yes, the plant.

74
00:05:43,134 --> 00:05:44,135
You're a leader now.

75
00:05:44,218 --> 00:05:47,221
Start cleaning leaves every morning
to show you mean business

76
00:05:47,305 --> 00:05:49,682
instead of bustling around
with messy hair.

77
00:05:51,017 --> 00:05:52,435
Don't send any orchids.

78
00:05:54,145 --> 00:05:54,979
Bye.

79
00:06:11,079 --> 00:06:12,580
HOSU POLICE JURISDICTION

80
00:06:27,345 --> 00:06:29,972
What are you doing
in an empty police station?

81
00:06:31,641 --> 00:06:33,393
It's not supposed to be empty, is it?

82
00:06:33,476 --> 00:06:35,186
It's not empty anymore.

83
00:06:37,772 --> 00:06:39,273
Nice to meet you. I am--

84
00:06:42,485 --> 00:06:43,319
Yes, babe.

85
00:06:43,820 --> 00:06:45,321
I'm working, of course.

86
00:06:46,447 --> 00:06:48,699
Nah, just an old lady
here for a complaint.

87
00:06:53,496 --> 00:06:54,664
One moment, sir.

88
00:06:57,917 --> 00:07:00,086
Can I help you with something?

89
00:07:10,096 --> 00:07:15,101
JULY 2001, MY FIRST CASE

90
00:07:26,737 --> 00:07:28,322
Lake View Motel. Can I help you?

91
00:07:28,406 --> 00:07:29,657
Get here in five.

92
00:07:30,450 --> 00:07:31,451
Goddamn it.

93
00:07:42,378 --> 00:07:43,963
Dude, it's done. Put it down.

94
00:07:44,464 --> 00:07:47,425
Damn, we should've eaten first.
I bet the noodles got soggy.

95
00:07:50,553 --> 00:07:51,554
Good as new.

96
00:07:52,305 --> 00:07:58,478
JONG-DU'S SUPERMARKET

97
00:08:15,036 --> 00:08:17,246
-Damn you!
-Mother!

98
00:08:17,330 --> 00:08:21,000
I told you to eat a decent meal.
Sang-jun worked overnight.

99
00:08:21,083 --> 00:08:24,003
You should know better
than to feed him cold food.

100
00:08:25,963 --> 00:08:29,592
He's eating it himself.
No one's shoving anything into his mouth.

101
00:08:29,675 --> 00:08:30,885
Look at all that sweat.

102
00:08:30,968 --> 00:08:34,222
Sang-jun, have some rice.
I'll serve you a meal in no time.

103
00:08:35,097 --> 00:08:35,932
I'm fine!

104
00:08:36,015 --> 00:08:37,642
Just start eating, Mother!

105
00:08:37,725 --> 00:08:40,186
My goodness.
Let me grill some bulgogi, at least.

106
00:08:40,269 --> 00:08:42,355
No, please. I have to get back quickly.

107
00:08:42,438 --> 00:08:45,233
My wife will kill me
if she finds out I'm not at the motel.

108
00:08:46,108 --> 00:08:47,944
Oh, I've got something for you.

109
00:08:52,031 --> 00:08:52,865
Here.

110
00:08:54,033 --> 00:08:55,201
What's all this?

111
00:08:55,868 --> 00:08:58,538
We had some towels made
for the motel's third anniversary.

112
00:08:58,621 --> 00:09:02,625
But why are you giving us so many?
Aren't these for your guests?

113
00:09:02,708 --> 00:09:05,545
Switch out your old towels
for these new ones.

114
00:09:06,128 --> 00:09:07,338
Use the old ones as rags.

115
00:09:07,421 --> 00:09:10,007
You cheap punk,
giving out souvenirs to show off--

116
00:09:10,091 --> 00:09:12,009
All this costs money, you know!

117
00:09:12,718 --> 00:09:15,388
I can't believe you two are the same age.

118
00:09:16,097 --> 00:09:19,141
He's so thoughtful and organized,
unlike you.

119
00:09:19,642 --> 00:09:24,480
Hey, why don't you have
some hot rice in soup before you go?

120
00:09:27,149 --> 00:09:29,068
Is she becoming senile or what?

121
00:09:30,027 --> 00:09:31,779
Hot rice in cold naengmyeon?

122
00:09:31,862 --> 00:09:33,364
-That's stupid.
-Hey.

123
00:09:33,447 --> 00:09:36,284
Don't let your mother have
cold food for breakfast.

124
00:09:36,367 --> 00:09:38,703
Serve her something with rice, you jerk.

125
00:09:39,203 --> 00:09:40,037
I'm off!

126
00:09:40,830 --> 00:09:41,664
See ya.

127
00:10:00,182 --> 00:10:02,685
LAKE VIEW MOTEL

128
00:10:20,870 --> 00:10:22,163
Hey, you're here.

129
00:10:22,246 --> 00:10:23,581
The front desk was unattended.

130
00:10:23,664 --> 00:10:26,500
There was too much garbage out front,
so I was cleaning it up.

131
00:10:27,793 --> 00:10:28,628
Let me.

132
00:10:29,879 --> 00:10:31,005
When did you get here?

133
00:10:34,258 --> 00:10:35,676
Did you enjoy your trip?

134
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:37,094
-Yes.
-Let me take your bags.

135
00:10:37,178 --> 00:10:38,512
-And the keys.
-Thank you.

136
00:10:38,596 --> 00:10:39,930
-Here.
-Thanks.

137
00:10:40,014 --> 00:10:41,849
Did you go to that restaurant yesterday?

138
00:10:41,932 --> 00:10:44,018
-We did. The food was great.
-So good.

139
00:10:44,101 --> 00:10:45,186
Right?

140
00:10:45,269 --> 00:10:48,105
People always go to the place next door,
but they're wrong.

141
00:10:48,189 --> 00:10:51,317
-No wonder the food was good.
-Want me to call you a taxi?

142
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:53,194
-Yes, please.
-Thanks!

143
00:10:53,277 --> 00:10:54,111
Just a moment.

144
00:10:54,195 --> 00:10:55,780
-Did you sleep well?
-Yes!

145
00:10:55,863 --> 00:10:57,615
-The room was spacious.
-We loved it.

146
00:10:57,698 --> 00:10:58,783
-And clean.
-Right?

147
00:10:59,325 --> 00:11:02,244
Hi, this is Lake View Motel.
Our guests are leaving.

148
00:11:06,666 --> 00:11:09,919
-See you again. Thank you so much.
-Okay. Thank you.

149
00:11:10,002 --> 00:11:11,337
-Thank you.
-Wait.

150
00:11:11,420 --> 00:11:12,922
One second!

151
00:11:14,048 --> 00:11:15,091
These are our towels.

152
00:11:15,174 --> 00:11:16,092
Take one.

153
00:11:17,051 --> 00:11:18,511
-One for you too.
-Thanks.

154
00:11:18,594 --> 00:11:20,930
-Recommend us to your friends.
-Thanks.

155
00:11:21,013 --> 00:11:22,098
Come again!

156
00:11:22,181 --> 00:11:23,766
-Goodbye.
-Have a safe trip!

157
00:11:30,815 --> 00:11:32,650
Shall we do some cleaning now?

158
00:11:47,039 --> 00:11:48,499
What kind of place was it?

159
00:11:50,292 --> 00:11:53,045
A run-of-the-mill motel in a country town.

160
00:11:56,632 --> 00:11:58,134
Business was good.

161
00:11:58,926 --> 00:12:01,721
It was near a lake and a mountain.

162
00:12:03,222 --> 00:12:05,224
There were a lot of young tourists,

163
00:12:06,016 --> 00:12:07,768
and even big groups too.

164
00:12:12,565 --> 00:12:14,608
Clean rooms and friendly staff…

165
00:12:16,193 --> 00:12:17,903
Just your average motel.

166
00:13:02,990 --> 00:13:04,116
Do you need help?

167
00:13:26,555 --> 00:13:27,807
Where are you headed?

168
00:13:28,724 --> 00:13:30,559
There's nothing up this way.

169
00:13:31,727 --> 00:13:33,687
I think you took a wrong turn.

170
00:13:33,771 --> 00:13:36,482
This path narrows ahead,
so I'll just turn the car around.

171
00:13:37,566 --> 00:13:39,235
Okay. Thank you.

172
00:13:39,318 --> 00:13:40,152
No problem.

173
00:13:58,504 --> 00:13:59,755
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

174
00:14:13,853 --> 00:14:15,688
Sorry I made you come here.

175
00:14:17,940 --> 00:14:19,108
Load this one up too.

176
00:14:19,191 --> 00:14:21,735
I'll drop by Yong-chae's place on the way.

177
00:14:21,819 --> 00:14:22,695
Thank you.

178
00:14:23,988 --> 00:14:27,491
What, a week later?
But I have guests coming!

179
00:14:27,575 --> 00:14:28,909
You must be joking!

180
00:14:33,038 --> 00:14:33,956
Hold on.

181
00:14:34,832 --> 00:14:36,083
For God's sake!

182
00:15:00,816 --> 00:15:01,734
Yeong-ha!

183
00:15:02,568 --> 00:15:06,196
This place is even cleaner
and more spacious than mine.

184
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:09,617
You'll see it's totally different
from the cookie-cutter rentals in town.

185
00:15:09,700 --> 00:15:11,952
Those places may look nice,

186
00:15:12,620 --> 00:15:14,496
but they were built with cheap materials.

187
00:15:15,915 --> 00:15:18,918
This place only accommodates a select few.

188
00:15:19,543 --> 00:15:22,087
He rarely accepts those
he doesn't know personally.

189
00:15:23,464 --> 00:15:24,798
Si-hyeon.

190
00:15:26,258 --> 00:15:27,551
I told you to stay still.

191
00:15:32,389 --> 00:15:33,223
Oh, right.

192
00:15:34,266 --> 00:15:35,601
There's a pool here too.

193
00:15:38,270 --> 00:15:39,104
The thing is,

194
00:15:40,522 --> 00:15:41,941
I'm afraid of water.

195
00:15:44,985 --> 00:15:46,403
Kiddo!

196
00:15:47,947 --> 00:15:51,617
How about we play
in the swimming pool later?

197
00:15:58,624 --> 00:16:00,209
Such a cute boy!

198
00:16:09,051 --> 00:16:10,636
Almost done, kiddo!

199
00:16:51,093 --> 00:16:52,511
Is that your puppy's spot?

200
00:17:58,243 --> 00:17:59,661
That must be your mom.

201
00:18:00,579 --> 00:18:01,413
Shall we go?

202
00:18:38,742 --> 00:18:40,077
Let's get you changed.

203
00:18:59,972 --> 00:19:00,889
Have fun!

204
00:19:02,891 --> 00:19:04,810
God, this is heavy.

205
00:19:07,146 --> 00:19:08,313
Thank you.

206
00:19:08,397 --> 00:19:11,400
How about some barbecue
for dinner tonight?

207
00:19:12,067 --> 00:19:13,735
Yong-chae felt bad about today.

208
00:19:13,819 --> 00:19:15,654
-He wants to treat you.
-No.

209
00:19:16,363 --> 00:19:17,531
Okay.

210
00:19:17,614 --> 00:19:19,950
It's just that my kid wanted me
to cook for him.

211
00:19:20,033 --> 00:19:22,369
I see. I'll let you rest.

212
00:19:22,452 --> 00:19:23,704
Excuse me.

213
00:19:26,331 --> 00:19:28,250
Does that thing work?

214
00:19:41,180 --> 00:19:42,431
It's a gun!

215
00:19:59,114 --> 00:20:00,115
Mind the steps.

216
00:20:06,788 --> 00:20:09,041
My wife used to collect these as a hobby.

217
00:20:13,378 --> 00:20:15,005
Have you ever listened to vinyl?

218
00:20:17,090 --> 00:20:17,966
No.

219
00:20:20,510 --> 00:20:22,679
Do you have any favorite songs or singers?

220
00:20:28,352 --> 00:20:29,311
Well, then.

221
00:20:30,604 --> 00:20:31,521
Let's see.

222
00:21:35,168 --> 00:21:37,212
What the… I wasn't expecting any rain.

223
00:22:26,553 --> 00:22:28,263
Open fire!

224
00:22:30,891 --> 00:22:32,184
Get him!

225
00:22:32,267 --> 00:22:33,935
Don't let him get away!

226
00:22:34,019 --> 00:22:35,687
-Let's go! Attack!
-Hey!

227
00:22:36,355 --> 00:22:37,856
Stop right there!

228
00:22:47,991 --> 00:22:49,785
You must be cold. Good Lord!

229
00:22:56,625 --> 00:22:58,377
Too bad we can't keep playing, huh?

230
00:22:58,460 --> 00:23:00,462
It can't be helped. It's raining.

231
00:23:01,046 --> 00:23:03,048
Wow! Is that right?

232
00:23:03,548 --> 00:23:05,467
You're a smart boy, Si-hun!

233
00:23:05,550 --> 00:23:06,551
It's Si-hyeon.

234
00:23:07,344 --> 00:23:08,929
Ha Si-hyeon.

235
00:23:10,931 --> 00:23:12,682
Time for dinner, Si-hyeon.

236
00:23:12,766 --> 00:23:14,434
Go to your mom now.

237
00:23:14,518 --> 00:23:15,352
Off you go!

238
00:23:17,479 --> 00:23:18,563
Careful now!

239
00:23:21,733 --> 00:23:23,985
The weatherman owes us
an apology for this one.

240
00:23:24,486 --> 00:23:26,530
Take a shower. I'll get you new clothes.

241
00:23:26,613 --> 00:23:29,241
No. I'll run to my place and come back.

242
00:23:53,473 --> 00:23:58,687
LAKE VIEW MOTEL

243
00:25:31,363 --> 00:25:32,572
Good heavens.

244
00:25:35,617 --> 00:25:36,451
Come in.

245
00:25:46,044 --> 00:25:48,004
Man, it's pouring out there.

246
00:25:49,464 --> 00:25:50,549
How much for a night?

247
00:25:51,049 --> 00:25:54,052
30,000 for a night. 40,000 for a suite.
Are you here for one night?

248
00:25:54,135 --> 00:25:55,136
Yes.

249
00:25:58,723 --> 00:25:59,558
All right.

250
00:26:08,817 --> 00:26:12,153
This is one of the suites.
You can watch the rain fall and relax.

251
00:26:13,280 --> 00:26:16,241
I'd actually like a room
on the second floor.

252
00:26:24,165 --> 00:26:25,000
Come in.

253
00:26:27,586 --> 00:26:29,462
It's quite big for one person.

254
00:26:42,851 --> 00:26:44,352
The view is not bad, huh?

255
00:26:48,773 --> 00:26:49,608
That's okay.

256
00:26:50,108 --> 00:26:53,236
Just come again if you like the room.
I'll leave your key here.

257
00:26:54,321 --> 00:26:55,405
Have a good night.

258
00:26:56,781 --> 00:26:57,699
Excuse me.

259
00:26:59,951 --> 00:27:01,786
Is there a gas station nearby?

260
00:27:02,287 --> 00:27:05,373
It's a bit far from here,
but I can call and ask them to deliver.

261
00:27:06,291 --> 00:27:07,125
No, thanks.

262
00:27:08,418 --> 00:27:10,253
If you change your mind, let me know.

263
00:27:11,046 --> 00:27:11,963
You're very kind.

264
00:27:14,132 --> 00:27:14,966
Good night.

265
00:28:00,595 --> 00:28:01,930
It's been raining all day.

266
00:28:08,812 --> 00:28:09,979
How are the guests?

267
00:28:11,147 --> 00:28:13,066
She'll call me if she needs anything.

268
00:28:13,149 --> 00:28:17,904
Young people these days prefer
to keep to themselves on trips.

269
00:28:18,947 --> 00:28:21,282
Look at how successful
the unmanned motels are.

270
00:28:26,037 --> 00:28:26,996
Right. Booze!

271
00:28:34,963 --> 00:28:35,880
Here you go.

272
00:28:39,384 --> 00:28:42,220
-Thanks for helping me today.
-Don't even mention it.

273
00:28:48,977 --> 00:28:50,562
What does she do for a living?

274
00:28:51,146 --> 00:28:51,980
What?

275
00:28:53,231 --> 00:28:55,024
I saw you two chatting earlier.

276
00:28:57,068 --> 00:28:58,862
I was just asking her about dinner.

277
00:29:02,532 --> 00:29:06,411
I get the feeling
that she's an artist or a musician.

278
00:29:07,245 --> 00:29:09,080
I'm a good judge of that, you know.

279
00:29:10,498 --> 00:29:13,501
-She's got a vibe similar to your wife's.
-Nonsense.

280
00:29:15,211 --> 00:29:17,046
I don't think she's a single mom.

281
00:29:17,130 --> 00:29:19,048
The boy said his dad was on a work trip.

282
00:29:19,132 --> 00:29:21,050
You're so nosy.

283
00:29:22,218 --> 00:29:23,303
Anyway, did you notice?

284
00:29:23,386 --> 00:29:25,388
She was instantly blown away by the house.

285
00:29:25,889 --> 00:29:27,640
Don't let this nice place go to waste.

286
00:29:27,724 --> 00:29:29,476
I like things the way they are.

287
00:29:33,396 --> 00:29:35,106
I can't handle more guests by myself.

288
00:29:36,316 --> 00:29:37,484
I manage alone just fine.

289
00:29:45,450 --> 00:29:47,494
Is your daughter visiting this summer?

290
00:29:48,703 --> 00:29:50,371
She'll be here next week.

291
00:29:51,539 --> 00:29:53,458
She has a kind heart, just like you.

292
00:29:53,541 --> 00:29:56,044
Look at my kids.
Those brats never show up.

293
00:29:59,631 --> 00:30:01,549
Yeong-ha, want to become in-laws?

294
00:30:03,843 --> 00:30:05,053
Please! You and me?

295
00:30:06,471 --> 00:30:08,306
-Why not?
-Don't be ridiculous.

296
00:30:09,516 --> 00:30:12,227
My second son, Gyeong-mo,
is 30 and works for an IT company.

297
00:30:12,310 --> 00:30:13,812
He's not bad-looking either.

298
00:30:14,312 --> 00:30:15,897
I'd make a great father-in-law.

299
00:30:15,980 --> 00:30:17,565
She's not marrying you, is she?

300
00:30:17,649 --> 00:30:19,484
Look at the bigger picture!

301
00:30:19,567 --> 00:30:22,153
I'm all washed-up now,
but I did okay back in the day.

302
00:30:22,237 --> 00:30:25,073
My hefty savings are why
my kids haven't cut ties with me.

303
00:30:25,156 --> 00:30:27,116
I'd leave it all to my daughter-in-law.

304
00:30:28,576 --> 00:30:29,410
Please.

305
00:30:30,411 --> 00:30:31,746
She's still too young.

306
00:30:32,539 --> 00:30:34,707
I'll just talk to her when she gets here.

307
00:30:35,208 --> 00:30:36,417
I doubt you will.

308
00:30:37,043 --> 00:30:38,002
Just keep drinking.

309
00:30:43,091 --> 00:30:45,093
Tomorrow, I'll clean this place for you.

310
00:30:45,176 --> 00:30:48,012
Every inch of the place,
including the pool!

311
00:30:51,766 --> 00:30:53,518
I wonder if the rain will stop by then.

312
00:31:42,191 --> 00:31:43,776
Sleep on the couch.

313
00:32:20,855 --> 00:32:21,898
Thank you.

314
00:32:33,701 --> 00:32:34,535
Hey, sweetie.

315
00:32:35,286 --> 00:32:36,704
I'm at the supermarket.

316
00:32:38,957 --> 00:32:40,458
Next week?

317
00:32:40,541 --> 00:32:42,627
You can come. There will be no guests.

318
00:32:45,296 --> 00:32:46,297
Who are you bringing?

319
00:32:46,798 --> 00:32:47,632
A friend?

320
00:32:49,300 --> 00:32:50,134
A guy?

321
00:32:51,469 --> 00:32:53,554
Yeah. Okay, then.

322
00:32:57,308 --> 00:32:58,977
A guy? Damn it.

323
00:33:19,247 --> 00:33:20,248
Sang-jun.

324
00:33:24,085 --> 00:33:25,253
You should go home.

325
00:33:26,087 --> 00:33:26,921
Sure.

326
00:33:46,774 --> 00:33:48,943
Oh, you must be the newcomer.

327
00:33:50,194 --> 00:33:52,530
Nice to meet you, sir. I'm Yoon Bo-min--

328
00:33:57,160 --> 00:34:00,413
-You have to keep being nice to them.
-Here's your cigarette, sir.

329
00:34:03,791 --> 00:34:04,876
-Can I have one?
-Yes.

330
00:34:09,547 --> 00:34:11,049
This feels great.

331
00:34:12,341 --> 00:34:13,676
-Mister.
-Yes?

332
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:15,261
I'd like some ramyeon, please.

333
00:34:15,928 --> 00:34:18,431
-You'd have to pay for it.
-That's right.

334
00:34:19,057 --> 00:34:19,891
Here.

335
00:34:22,393 --> 00:34:25,104
I could knock your ass out with one punch.

336
00:34:28,316 --> 00:34:29,817
Ah, this is the life!

337
00:34:54,008 --> 00:34:56,260
Dongho Police Station.
How can I assist you?

338
00:36:12,086 --> 00:36:14,005
The pigs are having a busy morning.

339
00:36:32,690 --> 00:36:34,859
-Who are those guys?
-Reporters, I think.

340
00:36:35,359 --> 00:36:36,944
How'd they find out so quickly?

341
00:36:37,028 --> 00:36:38,863
-Keep them out of here.
-Yes, sir.

342
00:36:38,946 --> 00:36:41,115
Don't let them through, no matter what!

343
00:36:41,199 --> 00:36:43,618
-Get moving! Help them!
-Okay. Let's go.

344
00:36:46,621 --> 00:36:47,788
Don't just stand there!

345
00:36:47,872 --> 00:36:49,040
-Stop them!
-Stay out.

346
00:36:49,123 --> 00:36:51,626
-Hurry!
-Hey, block them!

347
00:36:51,709 --> 00:36:52,668
What are you doing?

348
00:36:53,502 --> 00:36:54,503
Are you serious?

349
00:36:55,922 --> 00:36:57,423
Stop them from coming in!

350
00:37:12,396 --> 00:37:14,732
What are all these fools doing here?

351
00:37:24,158 --> 00:37:26,994
-Coming through. Move!
-Out of the way.

352
00:37:27,078 --> 00:37:28,412
-Get off.
-Excuse me?

353
00:37:30,331 --> 00:37:31,499
I said move!

354
00:37:31,582 --> 00:37:34,001
I'm the owner of this motel.
I need to get inside.

355
00:37:35,002 --> 00:37:36,671
-Well, you can't--
-Come on!

356
00:37:36,754 --> 00:37:39,674
-Let me go!
-What is wrong with you?

357
00:37:44,762 --> 00:37:46,847
-Eun-gyeong!
-You're not allowed.

358
00:37:46,931 --> 00:37:48,015
Go away!

359
00:37:53,938 --> 00:37:55,106
Do your job!

360
00:40:14,161 --> 00:40:15,830
-Hey!
-Leave me alone!

361
00:40:15,913 --> 00:40:18,416
-You can't come in here!
-I own this place.

362
00:40:23,879 --> 00:40:25,047
Eun-gyeong.

363
00:40:31,220 --> 00:40:32,304
Are you the owner?

364
00:40:32,388 --> 00:40:33,597
Why do you ask?

365
00:40:37,768 --> 00:40:39,603
This man came here yesterday, didn't he?

366
00:40:46,652 --> 00:40:47,695
What about him?

367
00:40:49,113 --> 00:40:50,698
Do you know what time he left

368
00:40:51,407 --> 00:40:52,867
and which way he went?

369
00:40:53,784 --> 00:40:54,618
What?

370
00:40:58,247 --> 00:40:59,665
He killed someone.

371
00:40:59,748 --> 00:41:00,749
Wait. Who killed…

372
00:41:01,375 --> 00:41:02,793
Where? In here?

373
00:41:02,877 --> 00:41:04,044
Hold on!

374
00:41:08,132 --> 00:41:09,383
He's a serial killer.

375
00:41:12,428 --> 00:41:14,638
It's Ji Hyang-cheol.
Tell the Mobile Investigation Unit

376
00:41:14,722 --> 00:41:16,974
to set up checkpoints
in Sanggye and Ikcheon too.

377
00:41:17,057 --> 00:41:17,892
Yes, sir.

378
00:41:19,059 --> 00:41:20,019
Upstairs, please.

379
00:41:22,146 --> 00:41:24,148
-A serial killer?
-Seriously?

380
00:45:04,910 --> 00:45:05,744
Shit.

381
00:45:06,662 --> 00:45:08,080
You can't come in here.

382
00:45:08,163 --> 00:45:09,331
Out, please.

383
00:45:09,415 --> 00:45:11,083
Get out. Detective Choi!

384
00:45:11,959 --> 00:45:13,794
You can't be in here. Come this way.

385
00:45:14,378 --> 00:45:15,963
Do you know what they call

386
00:45:16,505 --> 00:45:18,006
people like us?

387
00:45:25,222 --> 00:45:26,056
No.

388
00:45:27,725 --> 00:45:28,976
What do they call us?

389
00:46:21,028 --> 00:46:21,862
Frogs.
