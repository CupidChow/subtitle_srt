1
00:00:30,113 --> 00:00:31,197
It's all my fault.

2
00:00:36,286 --> 00:00:37,454
It's my fault!

3
00:00:47,464 --> 00:00:49,924
My fault! I…

4
00:00:55,722 --> 00:01:01,728
THE FROG

5
00:01:47,065 --> 00:01:49,818
Yu! You said
you wouldn't be able to make it.

6
00:01:50,318 --> 00:01:51,611
I had some time to spare.

7
00:01:53,446 --> 00:01:56,449
I wasn't expecting you.
I was going to call and let you know.

8
00:02:30,650 --> 00:02:32,235
Want some coffee, Seong-a?

9
00:02:34,821 --> 00:02:35,989
Yeah, sure.

10
00:02:37,323 --> 00:02:39,742
Su-a, go and get us coffee.

11
00:02:39,826 --> 00:02:40,660
Yes, ma'am.

12
00:02:47,083 --> 00:02:48,668
Let me explain everything.

13
00:02:49,752 --> 00:02:51,421
You see, what happened was…

14
00:02:53,756 --> 00:02:55,425
I wanted to see how it felt

15
00:02:56,467 --> 00:02:57,719
to backstab someone.

16
00:03:11,941 --> 00:03:12,775
Yeah?

17
00:03:13,443 --> 00:03:14,777
I told her to do it.

18
00:03:15,945 --> 00:03:16,779
Do what?

19
00:03:16,863 --> 00:03:19,616
Were you seriously trying
to exhibit those shoddy paintings?

20
00:03:20,366 --> 00:03:21,201
"Shoddy"?

21
00:03:21,284 --> 00:03:23,411
People will be buying them for my sake.

22
00:03:23,494 --> 00:03:25,663
At least paint something worth hanging up.

23
00:03:46,935 --> 00:03:48,019
Where are my paintings?

24
00:05:00,967 --> 00:05:01,968
Long time no see.

25
00:05:14,564 --> 00:05:16,274
Looks like prison agreed with you.

26
00:05:19,902 --> 00:05:20,820
You're looking well.

27
00:05:20,903 --> 00:05:22,071
Thanks to you.

28
00:05:27,243 --> 00:05:30,913
I should've sent you an invite.
This place must've been hard to find.

29
00:05:32,290 --> 00:05:35,126
I thought this card I found
on the street was my invitation.

30
00:06:00,276 --> 00:06:01,944
You're here anyway, so take a look.

31
00:06:03,196 --> 00:06:05,281
I painted them
while thinking of your dead kid.

32
00:06:31,349 --> 00:06:33,101
Fuck!

33
00:06:49,742 --> 00:06:51,160
Fucking son of a bitch.

34
00:07:06,008 --> 00:07:07,343
Are you crazy?

35
00:07:08,928 --> 00:07:10,096
Me? A domestic abuser?

36
00:07:11,806 --> 00:07:12,890
Why did you do it?

37
00:07:15,184 --> 00:07:17,520
If you hated me that much,
you should've killed me.

38
00:07:18,563 --> 00:07:21,232
Why? Why did you have to
take it out on Si-hyeon?

39
00:07:24,277 --> 00:07:26,654
What kind of mother would kill her child?

40
00:07:27,989 --> 00:07:28,823
Seong-a.

41
00:07:29,949 --> 00:07:32,577
Seong-a! Please.

42
00:07:33,202 --> 00:07:34,787
Just this once, please.

43
00:07:40,626 --> 00:07:41,919
I never hated you.

44
00:07:42,670 --> 00:07:44,338
Si-hyeon's the one I hated.

45
00:07:50,511 --> 00:07:51,596
What did he ever do?

46
00:07:51,679 --> 00:07:52,680
Can't remember.

47
00:07:54,390 --> 00:07:56,893
It was just so stressful
to see him every morning.

48
00:07:56,976 --> 00:07:58,478
Then you should've told me that.

49
00:07:58,561 --> 00:08:00,771
That's what that kid wanted,
for me to give up.

50
00:08:01,564 --> 00:08:02,565
That boy…

51
00:08:05,651 --> 00:08:07,153
loved you and trusted you.

52
00:08:08,905 --> 00:08:10,490
You know, he once asked me

53
00:08:11,657 --> 00:08:12,992
if I was his mom.

54
00:08:14,660 --> 00:08:18,414
Why didn't you tell him that his mom
ran away the moment he was born?

55
00:08:19,165 --> 00:08:21,167
How could I say that to a child?

56
00:08:25,213 --> 00:08:27,423
You led him to believe I was his mother.

57
00:08:28,007 --> 00:08:32,678
As punishment… for choosing you,
I had to pretend to love a damn kid.

58
00:08:36,557 --> 00:08:37,975
But could it be that

59
00:08:39,310 --> 00:08:41,479
you only wanted me to be a mother to him?

60
00:08:42,939 --> 00:08:44,690
If you didn't have a kid,

61
00:08:46,317 --> 00:08:47,985
would you still have married me?

62
00:08:50,780 --> 00:08:53,199
I did the only thing I could
to find out the answer.

63
00:08:56,744 --> 00:08:57,578
So,

64
00:08:59,455 --> 00:09:02,375
don't bother asking
when you won't get it, you fucking idiot!

65
00:10:09,567 --> 00:10:10,901
What's that guy doing?

66
00:10:12,278 --> 00:10:14,530
-What happened?
-I'm not sure.

67
00:11:34,735 --> 00:11:35,820
Hello!

68
00:11:35,903 --> 00:11:37,738
-Hi!
-Hello.

69
00:11:38,948 --> 00:11:39,865
-You came!
-Hi!

70
00:11:39,949 --> 00:11:41,283
-Hello.
-Enjoy the exhibit.

71
00:11:41,367 --> 00:11:43,369
-Director Choi.
-Good to see you!

72
00:11:43,953 --> 00:11:46,205
-The paintings are lovely.
-Thank you.

73
00:11:46,288 --> 00:11:48,290
-Congratulations.
-Thanks.

74
00:11:52,294 --> 00:11:53,212
Dr. Yoo!

75
00:11:53,963 --> 00:11:55,047
Welcome.

76
00:11:56,090 --> 00:11:58,676
Good work pulling this exhibit together.

77
00:11:58,759 --> 00:12:02,471
I wasn't able to offer you much help,
but this is just wonderful.

78
00:12:02,555 --> 00:12:03,639
Thank you, sir.

79
00:12:20,489 --> 00:12:22,074
Who is that?

80
00:12:22,783 --> 00:12:23,784
What's going on?

81
00:12:28,330 --> 00:12:31,208
Move. Get out of the way!

82
00:13:10,581 --> 00:13:12,041
Ha Jae-sik was released.

83
00:13:13,918 --> 00:13:16,295
Can't you have him sent away
to another country?

84
00:13:21,884 --> 00:13:22,885
No. You go.

85
00:13:33,979 --> 00:13:35,773
Then keep him busy for a few days.

86
00:13:38,150 --> 00:13:39,777
You can do that much, can't you?

87
00:14:11,725 --> 00:14:12,643
What the…

88
00:15:25,925 --> 00:15:26,759
Excuse me.

89
00:15:37,728 --> 00:15:38,938
ELDEST SON

90
00:15:43,859 --> 00:15:44,693
Hi, Dad.

91
00:15:45,694 --> 00:15:47,112
I just got discharged.

92
00:15:47,196 --> 00:15:50,032
Was that today?
Didn't you say it was next week?

93
00:15:50,950 --> 00:15:51,951
No need to come.

94
00:15:56,789 --> 00:15:57,873
Ungrateful kids.

95
00:16:01,460 --> 00:16:06,465
SINSEONGRU
TRADITIONAL CHINESE CUISINE

96
00:16:12,221 --> 00:16:14,556
I said I could just take a cab.

97
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:17,434
It's the least I can do
for one of my regulars.

98
00:16:19,645 --> 00:16:21,647
-I'll leave this over there.
-Yeah.

99
00:16:25,401 --> 00:16:26,485
Yeong-ha.

100
00:16:28,904 --> 00:16:30,155
Yeong-ha!

101
00:17:43,020 --> 00:17:45,105
MISSED CALL
UNCLE YONG-CHAE

102
00:17:53,655 --> 00:17:54,573
Hey, sweetie.

103
00:18:00,412 --> 00:18:02,331
I'm at your dad's rental right now,

104
00:18:02,414 --> 00:18:04,249
and I'm wondering if he's in Seoul.

105
00:18:07,377 --> 00:18:08,545
Dad's not home?

106
00:18:09,046 --> 00:18:10,589
I'm sure he'll be back soon.

107
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:13,092
Well, talk to you later.

108
00:18:13,592 --> 00:18:14,426
Bye.

109
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:20,474
DAD

110
00:18:36,281 --> 00:18:37,366
Can I help you?

111
00:18:45,457 --> 00:18:48,544
How do I deal with an obnoxious guest?

112
00:18:50,379 --> 00:18:51,880
Is she the obnoxious guest?

113
00:18:53,090 --> 00:18:54,299
Aren't you going to eat?

114
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:55,801
I already ate.

115
00:18:56,718 --> 00:19:00,222
You're really wolfing that jjamppong down,
considering it wasn't even yours.

116
00:19:01,849 --> 00:19:05,561
Good. Now I don't have to throw it out
after the noodles get all mushy.

117
00:19:09,648 --> 00:19:10,941
Have you been here long?

118
00:19:12,234 --> 00:19:13,318
For about a month.

119
00:19:14,111 --> 00:19:17,781
The walls outside look very pretty.
Did you paint that?

120
00:19:18,740 --> 00:19:21,493
They were a bit dull before.
Pretty colors, aren't they?

121
00:19:21,577 --> 00:19:23,537
And you redecorated the entire room too?

122
00:19:24,246 --> 00:19:27,749
Actually, the owner here agreed
to sell me this rental.

123
00:19:27,833 --> 00:19:28,834
Sell it?

124
00:19:29,501 --> 00:19:30,335
Yes.

125
00:19:31,170 --> 00:19:33,589
The owner said he was selling this place?

126
00:19:35,757 --> 00:19:36,592
Yeah.

127
00:19:45,017 --> 00:19:48,562
I'll refund the rest of your stay.
Leave sometime tomorrow.

128
00:19:49,062 --> 00:19:50,647
Or else I'll take legal action.

129
00:19:50,731 --> 00:19:53,859
Then I'll make sure you pay
every last penny in damages

130
00:19:53,942 --> 00:19:56,278
for what you've done to this place!

131
00:19:56,361 --> 00:19:57,779
And who the heck are you?

132
00:19:57,863 --> 00:19:59,448
An expert in this matter.

133
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:01,325
"This matter"?

134
00:20:01,408 --> 00:20:03,076
Dealing with liars.

135
00:20:24,765 --> 00:20:26,683
How long has he been dealing with her?

136
00:20:32,397 --> 00:20:33,565
Hold on.

137
00:20:34,983 --> 00:20:36,860
I'M AT YOUR PLACE NOW.
IS THAT THE WOMAN WHO…

138
00:20:36,944 --> 00:20:37,778
Hey, you!

139
00:20:42,950 --> 00:20:43,784
"Hey, you"?

140
00:20:51,208 --> 00:20:53,001
When he gets back, you ask him

141
00:20:53,877 --> 00:20:55,587
whether I'm a liar or not.

142
00:20:57,297 --> 00:20:58,715
I don't need to ask him.

143
00:20:58,799 --> 00:21:02,219
Yeong-ha, sell this place?
He's a man set in his ways.

144
00:21:02,719 --> 00:21:05,555
He said he'd die in this house,
not sell it to a girl like you!

145
00:21:07,683 --> 00:21:10,018
Then he's the one who lied, not me.

146
00:21:13,855 --> 00:21:15,691
For Christ's sake.

147
00:21:22,155 --> 00:21:23,156
Say you're sorry.

148
00:21:29,871 --> 00:21:31,707
Were you raised in a barn?

149
00:21:32,541 --> 00:21:34,543
You'd be dead if you were my kid.

150
00:21:40,549 --> 00:21:41,383
Hey.

151
00:21:42,050 --> 00:21:42,884
Hey!

152
00:21:44,303 --> 00:21:45,721
What the hell?

153
00:21:46,805 --> 00:21:47,639
Get off!

154
00:21:47,723 --> 00:21:48,724
Die.

155
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:00,110
Fuck!

156
00:22:06,742 --> 00:22:10,078
Look at you.
Why'd you have to make it a big deal?

157
00:22:42,361 --> 00:22:44,196
Die!

158
00:23:54,766 --> 00:23:57,185
CHLORINE BLEACH

159
00:24:58,079 --> 00:25:03,502
CHLORINE BLEACH

160
00:25:41,122 --> 00:25:42,791
Hello, Yoon Bo-min speaking.

161
00:25:43,291 --> 00:25:45,752
Hi, I have something to report.

162
00:26:01,768 --> 00:26:03,353
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

163
00:26:09,025 --> 00:26:10,777
Your dad got a little hurt.

164
00:26:11,361 --> 00:26:14,447
He told me not to tell you,
but he's at his rental right now.

165
00:26:16,449 --> 00:26:19,369
DAD

166
00:26:34,843 --> 00:26:36,011
Is something wrong?

167
00:26:40,849 --> 00:26:43,184
Sorry, but I have to head home early.

168
00:27:15,050 --> 00:27:16,134
Dad.

169
00:27:18,553 --> 00:27:19,387
Dad?

170
00:27:20,764 --> 00:27:22,432
Dad, it's me.

171
00:27:26,811 --> 00:27:27,646
Dad.

172
00:27:34,736 --> 00:27:37,155
-Dad. Where are you?
-Ui-seon!

173
00:27:40,158 --> 00:27:41,576
Ui-seon!

174
00:28:26,955 --> 00:28:27,789
Hello!

175
00:28:37,632 --> 00:28:39,050
Don't you remember me?

176
00:28:40,385 --> 00:28:43,304
I think your dad was meeting his in-laws
for the first time.

177
00:28:43,388 --> 00:28:44,264
The wine.

178
00:28:44,889 --> 00:28:47,142
Oh, you gave us that bottle of wine…

179
00:28:50,812 --> 00:28:53,314
The thing is,
I can't seem to get a hold of him.

180
00:28:53,398 --> 00:28:56,484
I have something to discuss with him
before checking out,

181
00:28:56,985 --> 00:28:58,570
but he's not answering his phone.

182
00:29:18,840 --> 00:29:20,717
So he's ghosting his goddamn kid too.

183
00:29:22,761 --> 00:29:23,595
Pardon?

184
00:29:24,345 --> 00:29:25,847
Did he die in a ditch somewhere?

185
00:29:41,112 --> 00:29:41,946
Wait!

186
00:29:42,864 --> 00:29:45,867
I'll tell you!
I'll tell you everything, okay?

187
00:29:49,537 --> 00:29:50,872
How are you so strong?

188
00:29:53,625 --> 00:29:54,793
God, I'm tired.

189
00:29:56,628 --> 00:29:59,464
You see, he and I are accomplices.

190
00:30:00,590 --> 00:30:01,591
What?

191
00:30:01,674 --> 00:30:05,637
Your dad and I killed a kid in this house.
He was my ex-husband's son.

192
00:30:05,720 --> 00:30:09,432
I put him to sleep by drugging his food
and then strangled him to death.

193
00:30:09,516 --> 00:30:13,102
I covered the bathroom floor with plastic,
dismembered the body, and…

194
00:30:13,186 --> 00:30:16,189
God, seriously. I'm so sick of it all.

195
00:30:17,524 --> 00:30:21,528
Anyway, your dad basically helped me
in various ways with the clean-up.

196
00:30:26,157 --> 00:30:26,991
And why would he?

197
00:30:28,576 --> 00:30:31,704
What would happen to this rental
if word spread about the dead kid?

198
00:30:32,664 --> 00:30:35,959
I need to discuss things with your dad,
so keep calling him.

199
00:30:36,042 --> 00:30:38,044
Text him. Let him know you're with me.

200
00:30:38,545 --> 00:30:40,463
That'll scare him, and he'll come running.

201
00:30:43,132 --> 00:30:44,217
Damn it.

202
00:30:55,186 --> 00:30:56,771
This is so interesting.

203
00:31:02,777 --> 00:31:04,070
I'm a pharmacist, you know.

204
00:31:05,488 --> 00:31:09,367
You need to be on medication.
Want me to refer you to a psychiatrist?

205
00:31:11,703 --> 00:31:12,954
No, thanks. I'm good.

206
00:31:19,961 --> 00:31:21,880
Hey, let me go.

207
00:31:34,893 --> 00:31:36,811
You've been harassing my dad, haven't you?

208
00:31:36,895 --> 00:31:37,729
No!

209
00:31:40,023 --> 00:31:42,025
Then let's wait for him here together.

210
00:31:42,525 --> 00:31:43,693
Fine. By the way,

211
00:31:45,153 --> 00:31:46,070
aren't you sleepy?

212
00:32:47,048 --> 00:32:47,882
Uncle!

213
00:32:48,633 --> 00:32:49,467
Uncle!

214
00:32:53,054 --> 00:32:54,764
Hold on.

215
00:32:55,890 --> 00:32:56,933
-Ui-seon.
-Yes?

216
00:33:03,356 --> 00:33:05,858
You motherfuckers
are making this really fun.

217
00:33:09,529 --> 00:33:10,613
You crazy bitch!

218
00:34:07,211 --> 00:34:09,297
This fucking bitch.

219
00:34:16,804 --> 00:34:18,222
Come here.

220
00:34:26,981 --> 00:34:28,566
Die.

221
00:35:21,035 --> 00:35:23,079
DAD

222
00:35:32,463 --> 00:35:33,297
Hello?

223
00:35:37,218 --> 00:35:38,136
Mister?

224
00:35:42,473 --> 00:35:44,892
Mister!

225
00:35:47,311 --> 00:35:49,397
Mister.

226
00:35:50,148 --> 00:35:51,232
Mister.

227
00:35:53,234 --> 00:35:54,152
Tell me.

228
00:35:55,862 --> 00:35:57,363
When are you coming back?

229
00:36:02,743 --> 00:36:03,995
POWER OFF

230
00:36:32,982 --> 00:36:35,651
Ji-su. Is Ui-seon with you?

231
00:36:35,735 --> 00:36:38,404
She texted earlier
to say she got to the rental.

232
00:36:38,487 --> 00:36:39,822
Have you not met her yet?

233
00:36:42,116 --> 00:36:42,950
Okay.

234
00:37:38,673 --> 00:37:39,507
Ui-seon.

235
00:37:43,261 --> 00:37:44,095
Jeon Ui-seon!

236
00:38:19,130 --> 00:38:20,673
Is that a real gun?

237
00:38:20,756 --> 00:38:21,841
Where is she?

238
00:38:21,924 --> 00:38:23,843
Shoot something with it. This here.

239
00:38:24,343 --> 00:38:25,261
Answer me!

240
00:38:30,308 --> 00:38:31,434
Drop the gun.

241
00:38:36,939 --> 00:38:38,941
I should kill you and look for her myself.

242
00:38:39,025 --> 00:38:40,359
No, you won't find her.

243
00:38:40,860 --> 00:38:43,654
If you want to find her alive,
just do as I say.

244
00:38:45,072 --> 00:38:46,824
That'll be the quickest way.

245
00:38:49,827 --> 00:38:50,661
I'm serious.

246
00:39:07,011 --> 00:39:07,845
You know, I…

247
00:39:09,847 --> 00:39:11,807
I didn't want to do this either.

248
00:39:14,518 --> 00:39:18,522
But everybody's been stabbing me
in the back for the past two days.

249
00:39:19,523 --> 00:39:21,192
Come to think of it,

250
00:39:21,275 --> 00:39:24,278
you were also lying to me
about selling this place, weren't you?

251
00:39:26,781 --> 00:39:30,284
A gun?
I can't believe you've brought a gun.

252
00:39:30,368 --> 00:39:31,702
It wasn't a lie.

253
00:39:33,037 --> 00:39:34,372
I was planning to sell it.

254
00:39:35,831 --> 00:39:37,833
Until you stabbed me in the back, that is.

255
00:39:40,044 --> 00:39:41,879
I had my exhibit, thanks to you.

256
00:39:44,715 --> 00:39:46,300
Whenever I'm in this rental,

257
00:39:47,676 --> 00:39:49,261
my creative juices get flowing.

258
00:39:52,556 --> 00:39:54,308
The paintings I've created here…

259
00:39:56,352 --> 00:40:00,189
make me want to throw away
every piece of art I made before.

260
00:40:00,898 --> 00:40:02,566
That's how much I love them.

261
00:40:04,318 --> 00:40:06,028
But you know what happened?

262
00:40:11,617 --> 00:40:12,827
This is the result.

263
00:40:15,746 --> 00:40:17,832
I gave them real art,
but they didn't get it.

264
00:40:28,092 --> 00:40:29,760
You don't quite believe me, do you?

265
00:40:30,511 --> 00:40:33,514
You think I'd never go as far
as to kill your daughter.

266
00:40:41,689 --> 00:40:43,774
So it's a real gun,

267
00:40:45,192 --> 00:40:47,111
and you won't hesitate to shoot it.

268
00:40:49,196 --> 00:40:52,950
But you're still open… to negotiation.

269
00:40:53,617 --> 00:40:55,453
That is my interpretation.

270
00:41:03,627 --> 00:41:05,129
I'll give you 30 minutes.

271
00:41:05,963 --> 00:41:07,506
Check the basement first.

272
00:41:08,132 --> 00:41:09,884
Let's talk after you save your friend.

273
00:41:20,936 --> 00:41:21,812
Yong-chae.

274
00:41:32,656 --> 00:41:33,491
Yong…

275
00:41:35,993 --> 00:41:36,827
Yong-chae.

276
00:41:42,750 --> 00:41:43,584
Yong-chae.

277
00:41:45,753 --> 00:41:46,587
Hey!

278
00:41:55,346 --> 00:41:56,263
Yeong-ha!

279
00:41:56,764 --> 00:41:59,683
Hey, what's going on?
What happened to Yong-chae?

280
00:42:00,726 --> 00:42:03,062
Stay with Yong-chae
until his family gets here.

281
00:42:16,408 --> 00:42:17,284
Wait, what--

282
00:42:21,705 --> 00:42:23,040
Yeong-ha, wait up!

283
00:42:23,123 --> 00:42:26,544
What happened to Yong-chae
is not a simple injury, is it?

284
00:42:27,503 --> 00:42:30,130
What is it? Who did that to him?

285
00:42:30,798 --> 00:42:31,632
Let go of me.

286
00:42:32,633 --> 00:42:33,551
No!

287
00:42:35,010 --> 00:42:36,303
Did you do that?

288
00:42:38,222 --> 00:42:40,391
Why do you keep trying to take off?

289
00:42:42,142 --> 00:42:43,727
Hey, wait a minute.

290
00:42:43,811 --> 00:42:46,480
How could you rough up a man
who just got out of the hospital…

291
00:42:46,564 --> 00:42:49,483
Get out of the car.
I'm going to call the police right now!

292
00:42:49,567 --> 00:42:50,484
Hello, police?

293
00:43:53,005 --> 00:43:54,131
What's he doing?

294
00:43:55,049 --> 00:43:56,508
That crazy bastard!

295
00:44:40,135 --> 00:44:43,472
Have you lost your mind?
Do you want your daughter to die?

296
00:45:45,159 --> 00:45:45,993
Where is she?

297
00:45:50,664 --> 00:45:51,915
Where is my daughter?

298
00:47:10,577 --> 00:47:11,745
What a sight.

299
00:47:12,830 --> 00:47:14,206
Is it because of your friend?

300
00:47:14,790 --> 00:47:16,083
That fucker asked for it.

301
00:47:16,166 --> 00:47:18,418
I've learned something
over the past two days.

302
00:47:19,211 --> 00:47:20,462
Why so serious?

303
00:47:20,546 --> 00:47:24,550
Procrastinating, avoiding, and hiding

304
00:47:26,260 --> 00:47:29,263
lead to terrible things
piling up endlessly.

305
00:47:30,514 --> 00:47:32,182
I saw that with my own eyes.

306
00:47:34,351 --> 00:47:36,353
Trying not to get blood on my hands

307
00:47:37,312 --> 00:47:39,690
only results in hurting
the people I care about.

308
00:47:40,274 --> 00:47:41,400
I'm going to end this.

309
00:47:41,483 --> 00:47:42,901
Once we work out a deal…

310
00:47:47,239 --> 00:47:48,073
I'll be leaving.

311
00:47:53,036 --> 00:47:54,371
My exhibit's over, so…

312
00:47:57,666 --> 00:48:00,377
-I'll be leaving tomorrow.
-You think you can run away?

313
00:48:01,795 --> 00:48:03,338
After everything you've done?

314
00:48:05,048 --> 00:48:07,718
You'll find your daughter safe and sound.

315
00:48:08,385 --> 00:48:12,639
As for your friend,
he suffered an injury, but he'll heal.

316
00:48:14,224 --> 00:48:16,435
You can be happy again in this place.

317
00:48:18,562 --> 00:48:21,106
It'll be like none of this ever happened.

318
00:48:23,483 --> 00:48:24,818
I'm never coming back.

319
00:48:27,321 --> 00:48:28,614
I'm saying this is the end.

320
00:48:34,828 --> 00:48:37,581
But if you make the wrong decision
at this moment,

321
00:48:38,165 --> 00:48:40,918
then I'll see this whole thing through
with you,

322
00:48:42,461 --> 00:48:44,630
and your home
will turn into a living hell.

323
00:48:46,381 --> 00:48:47,758
And it will end

324
00:48:49,217 --> 00:48:51,595
with you watching helplessly
as your daughter dies.

325
00:49:03,607 --> 00:49:04,775
The clock is ticking.

326
00:49:21,833 --> 00:49:22,918
Who's that?

327
00:49:23,001 --> 00:49:24,544
CAPTAIN YOON BO-MIN

328
00:49:24,628 --> 00:49:25,671
It's the police.

329
00:49:27,923 --> 00:49:30,550
Didn't you see this coming
after what you did to him?

330
00:49:32,552 --> 00:49:35,973
Once the doctors are done patching him up
and Yong-chae wakes up,

331
00:49:36,473 --> 00:49:38,934
he'll immediately tell the police
what you did.

332
00:49:40,811 --> 00:49:42,396
You're running out of time too.

333
00:50:11,675 --> 00:50:12,759
What do you want?

334
00:50:15,429 --> 00:50:17,014
It's been such a long day.

335
00:50:19,182 --> 00:50:20,267
Let's have water first.

336
00:50:39,286 --> 00:50:40,704
Get that thing out of my sight.

337
00:50:48,420 --> 00:50:51,631
Make sure your friend
and your daughter keep their mouths shut.

338
00:50:52,549 --> 00:50:54,843
I guess I don't need to tell you that.

339
00:50:58,889 --> 00:50:59,723
And?

340
00:51:00,474 --> 00:51:02,976
Someone might come here looking for me.

341
00:51:03,060 --> 00:51:04,519
He's fucking insane.

342
00:51:05,979 --> 00:51:09,149
He'll probably end up being
three times the headache I was

343
00:51:09,691 --> 00:51:11,109
because he isn't fun like me.

344
00:51:13,195 --> 00:51:16,531
Just tell him you don't know me
and that I never came here.

345
00:51:17,949 --> 00:51:21,286
And finally…

346
00:51:25,665 --> 00:51:27,667
help me bury something on this property.

347
00:51:29,586 --> 00:51:31,171
Ideally, in the vegetable garden.

348
00:51:31,755 --> 00:51:33,090
What have you done this time?

349
00:51:34,591 --> 00:51:36,426
Don't you think it's better not to know?

350
00:51:37,427 --> 00:51:38,637
Just like a year ago.

351
00:51:51,274 --> 00:51:52,109
Fine.

352
00:51:54,444 --> 00:51:56,446
But I need to see my daughter first.

353
00:51:59,491 --> 00:52:00,575
Save me the bullshit.

354
00:52:00,659 --> 00:52:03,328
Yong-chae and Ui-seon
will do whatever I tell them to.

355
00:52:04,788 --> 00:52:09,292
Telling that man that I don't know you?
I have no problem with that at all.

356
00:52:10,085 --> 00:52:11,336
In fact, I'd prefer it.

357
00:52:23,807 --> 00:52:24,724
CAPTAIN YOON BO-MIN

358
00:52:26,601 --> 00:52:28,436
It's your turn to choose.

359
00:52:29,354 --> 00:52:31,982
Either save my daughter
and bury whatever you want here,

360
00:52:32,899 --> 00:52:35,068
or see this through to the end with me.

361
00:52:41,783 --> 00:52:44,286
If you go back on your word,
I'm gonna lose it.

362
00:52:44,369 --> 00:52:45,662
Shut up and get in the car.

363
00:53:46,056 --> 00:53:47,641
In there, all this time?

364
00:53:53,313 --> 00:53:55,398
Come on. Get her out of there already.

365
00:54:07,452 --> 00:54:08,703
You bring her here.

366
00:54:47,701 --> 00:54:48,702
Ms. Yoo Seong-a.

367
00:54:53,581 --> 00:54:55,250
Going somewhere again?

368
00:55:12,976 --> 00:55:15,979
What… what is happening right…

369
00:55:18,523 --> 00:55:20,525
Hi, I have something to report.

370
00:55:20,608 --> 00:55:23,278
I don't think
it's worth filing a formal report,

371
00:55:23,361 --> 00:55:26,406
but it didn't feel right
to just let it slide,

372
00:55:26,489 --> 00:55:29,492
which is why I thought
I'd just give you a call, Captain.

373
00:55:29,576 --> 00:55:32,787
Yes, but he really isn't the type of guy
who would do such a thing.

374
00:55:32,871 --> 00:55:34,789
And he's very close with Yong-chae--

375
00:55:34,873 --> 00:55:36,958
-He was stabbed with what?
-A screwdriver.

376
00:56:08,239 --> 00:56:09,824
Now, please tell me.

377
00:56:11,201 --> 00:56:13,244
First, she had a fight with your guests.

378
00:56:14,204 --> 00:56:16,081
Then there was the Officer Kim incident.

379
00:56:17,415 --> 00:56:21,169
This person called the police
to your rental twice in only a few days.

380
00:56:22,796 --> 00:56:27,008
She's the kind of person who, unlike you,
lets her anger make her throw a punch.

381
00:56:29,302 --> 00:56:30,387
Yoo Seong-a.

382
00:56:34,140 --> 00:56:36,601
I'm asking you
what that woman is doing right now.

383
00:56:40,146 --> 00:56:41,606
She took my daughter.

384
00:56:44,609 --> 00:56:45,527
I don't know where.

385
00:56:46,403 --> 00:56:48,405
Accept her demands
and rescue your daughter.

386
00:56:48,488 --> 00:56:49,489
Once I do that,

387
00:56:50,907 --> 00:56:52,075
she'll run away.

388
00:56:52,158 --> 00:56:54,536
Mr. Jeon,
we have to find your daughter first.

389
00:56:55,745 --> 00:56:57,497
-We can arrest her after--
-No.

390
00:56:59,499 --> 00:57:01,209
If you don't catch her tonight,

391
00:57:02,919 --> 00:57:04,587
I might kill her myself.

392
00:57:11,261 --> 00:57:14,097
Then we'll catch her tonight.

393
00:57:15,348 --> 00:57:18,101
Go to your rental,
and buy us as much time as possible

394
00:57:18,184 --> 00:57:20,437
while we search for your daughter.

395
00:57:21,104 --> 00:57:24,691
I'll call you. If the search fails,
I'll end the call right away.

396
00:57:24,774 --> 00:57:27,694
If we find her, I'll let it keep ringing,
so decline my call.

397
00:57:41,666 --> 00:57:42,709
CAPTAIN YOON BO-MIN

398
00:57:46,004 --> 00:57:48,590
Keep tracking her and call me.
I'll head over first.

399
00:57:48,673 --> 00:57:49,632
Yes, Captain.

400
00:58:00,685 --> 00:58:05,440
After I call you for the second time,
lure Yoo Seong-a to the crime scene.

401
00:58:06,649 --> 00:58:09,235
The only way we'll catch her red-handed

402
00:58:10,570 --> 00:58:14,157
is if she shows up at the scene
of her own volition.

403
00:58:26,544 --> 00:58:29,964
Why don't you go to the hospital?
You should be with your daughter.

404
00:58:31,049 --> 00:58:32,550
Escort Mr. Jeon to the hospital.

405
00:58:32,634 --> 00:58:33,968
-Yes, Captain.
-Go on.

406
00:58:35,011 --> 00:58:36,179
Where are you going?

407
00:58:36,262 --> 00:58:37,764
Where do you think you're going?

408
00:58:39,724 --> 00:58:41,226
Let go. I said let go!

409
00:58:41,309 --> 00:58:42,727
-Grab her.
-Let go!

410
00:58:42,810 --> 00:58:43,728
Come here!

411
00:58:43,811 --> 00:58:46,147
Can't you see I'm injured?
That man assaulted me!

412
00:58:46,231 --> 00:58:48,816
I'm the victim here! Let go of me!

413
00:58:48,900 --> 00:58:50,401
Stay still!

414
00:58:53,238 --> 00:58:54,572
Let go!

415
00:58:54,656 --> 00:58:57,075
You're under arrest
for assault and kidnapping.

416
00:58:58,618 --> 00:59:00,328
You have the right to an attorney.

417
00:59:01,287 --> 00:59:05,875
You can explain yourself… or refuse
to make an incriminating statement.

418
00:59:06,918 --> 00:59:09,546
You can petition
for a writ of habeas corpus.

419
00:59:16,886 --> 00:59:18,888
Let go!

420
00:59:29,065 --> 00:59:29,899
Ui-seon.

421
00:59:42,495 --> 00:59:43,329
Yeong-ha?

422
00:59:49,961 --> 00:59:52,630
Excuse me. Jeon Ui-seon.

423
00:59:52,714 --> 00:59:54,716
-Are you her guardian?
-Yes.

424
00:59:54,799 --> 00:59:58,469
Her blood pressure is constantly dropping
due to intra-abdominal bleeding.

425
00:59:58,970 --> 01:00:01,306
Please sign this for emergency surgery.

426
01:00:01,389 --> 01:00:02,223
SURGICAL CONSENT FORM

427
01:00:02,307 --> 01:00:05,268
We may need to abort the baby
to save the mother's life.

428
01:00:05,351 --> 01:00:06,185
The mother?

429
01:00:07,979 --> 01:00:08,813
The baby?

430
01:00:08,896 --> 01:00:09,731
Yes.

431
01:00:26,873 --> 01:00:27,707
Ui-seon.

432
01:00:31,586 --> 01:00:32,587
Sweetie.

433
01:00:35,548 --> 01:00:36,966
Please wait here.

434
01:00:57,403 --> 01:00:58,571
It's all my fault.

435
01:01:03,660 --> 01:01:04,827
It's my fault!

436
01:01:10,750 --> 01:01:12,335
It's okay. She'll be all right.

437
01:01:12,418 --> 01:01:14,587
My fault! I…

438
01:01:19,509 --> 01:01:21,177
I made that happen to her.

439
01:01:23,179 --> 01:01:24,347
She will be okay.

440
01:01:43,366 --> 01:01:44,367
Get out of the car.

441
01:02:11,394 --> 01:02:12,478
Are you all right?

442
01:02:16,482 --> 01:02:17,650
What happened today

443
01:02:19,527 --> 01:02:21,195
is all my fault.

444
01:02:24,240 --> 01:02:25,992
Innocent people…

445
01:02:29,912 --> 01:02:31,414
and my child got hurt.

446
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:35,001
Because of what I did.

447
01:02:37,628 --> 01:02:38,796
A frog.

448
01:02:41,924 --> 01:02:43,259
Someone once said to me

449
01:02:44,510 --> 01:02:46,846
that when you get caught up
in something terrible,

450
01:02:48,514 --> 01:02:53,186
you end up blaming yourself, thinking,
"Why did the stone hit me, of all people?"

451
01:02:55,271 --> 01:02:56,981
Just like the frog from the story.

452
01:03:02,653 --> 01:03:05,072
You're the victim in all of this,
Mr. Jeon.

453
01:03:06,365 --> 01:03:08,493
Was there another way
you could've handled this?

454
01:03:09,786 --> 01:03:12,288
Could you have done something sooner?

455
01:03:14,457 --> 01:03:16,209
No, you did the best you could.

456
01:03:17,627 --> 01:03:19,295
As any regular person could.

457
01:03:26,302 --> 01:03:27,887
Take your time

458
01:03:29,430 --> 01:03:31,641
and stay with your daughter
as she recovers.

459
01:03:33,017 --> 01:03:35,478
After that, lend us a hand
with the investigation.

460
01:04:17,728 --> 01:04:19,939
She was going to bury something
at the rental.

461
01:04:21,440 --> 01:04:22,441
She might have…

462
01:04:24,443 --> 01:04:25,945
killed somebody.
