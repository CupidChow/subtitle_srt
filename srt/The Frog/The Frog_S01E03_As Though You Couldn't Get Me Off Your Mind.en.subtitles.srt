1
00:00:25,942 --> 00:00:27,736
A giant tree fell in a forest…

2
00:00:30,572 --> 00:00:32,532
and no one was around to hear it.

3
00:00:39,706 --> 00:00:44,711
Did it make a sound,
or was there nothing but silence?

4
00:00:52,218 --> 00:00:53,720
You're late.

5
00:00:53,803 --> 00:01:00,769
THE FROG

6
00:01:17,035 --> 00:01:18,203
Director, eat with us.

7
00:01:18,286 --> 00:01:19,788
-You go ahead.
-Enjoy your lunch.

8
00:01:19,871 --> 00:01:21,331
-Enjoy your lunch, sir.
-Thanks.

9
00:01:29,839 --> 00:01:30,840
What?

10
00:01:31,716 --> 00:01:32,634
You got a bad tan.

11
00:01:33,218 --> 00:01:34,052
Did I?

12
00:01:39,933 --> 00:01:41,935
Then just use the place
as a vacation home.

13
00:01:42,936 --> 00:01:44,979
Who runs a vacation rental at our age?

14
00:01:45,730 --> 00:01:47,482
My wife's learning the business.

15
00:01:47,565 --> 00:01:50,485
She enjoys being more active
and working in the fresh air.

16
00:01:50,568 --> 00:01:52,070
But it's far from the hospital.

17
00:01:52,153 --> 00:01:54,197
That's okay. She has regular appointments.

18
00:01:54,948 --> 00:01:58,284
Didn't they offer you leave
instead of accepting your resignation?

19
00:01:59,536 --> 00:02:02,372
Executives are contract workers anyway.

20
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:05,208
What's the point of all that?

21
00:02:06,292 --> 00:02:08,711
-Can we get a refill on the side dishes?
-Sure.

22
00:02:10,046 --> 00:02:13,258
Everyone I know who built houses
out in the countryside

23
00:02:13,925 --> 00:02:15,927
ended up renting them out and returning.

24
00:02:17,971 --> 00:02:19,556
I have nowhere to return to.

25
00:02:21,558 --> 00:02:23,059
I put our place up for sale.

26
00:02:23,143 --> 00:02:25,562
Hey, that's a terrible idea.

27
00:02:25,645 --> 00:02:27,397
Quitting your job is one thing.

28
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:32,026
Selling an apartment in Seoul right now
is throwing money away.

29
00:02:32,110 --> 00:02:34,362
Call your realtor right away.

30
00:02:36,573 --> 00:02:37,574
Here's an idea.

31
00:02:38,992 --> 00:02:42,120
I'll contact a company I know
to see if they have a spot.

32
00:02:43,121 --> 00:02:45,290
The food's still good here.

33
00:03:03,057 --> 00:03:04,726
The doctors said three months.

34
00:03:06,436 --> 00:03:10,648
My wife might be gone in three months.

35
00:03:14,110 --> 00:03:16,905
I'd have gone into debt
if it meant I could buy her more time.

36
00:03:17,405 --> 00:03:18,406
Have some juice.

37
00:03:18,489 --> 00:03:19,741
That vacation rental was…

38
00:03:19,824 --> 00:03:21,326
You did such an excellent job.

39
00:03:21,409 --> 00:03:23,161
…the only thing I could give her.

40
00:03:24,078 --> 00:03:25,246
Isn't this place nice?

41
00:03:25,330 --> 00:03:27,081
More than nice.

42
00:03:27,165 --> 00:03:29,918
Now, it's the only thing that I have left.

43
00:03:30,543 --> 00:03:32,045
Honey, he's about to leave.

44
00:03:32,128 --> 00:03:33,213
Okay. One sec.

45
00:05:09,225 --> 00:05:10,143
Can…

46
00:05:14,063 --> 00:05:15,398
can I help you?

47
00:05:16,899 --> 00:05:18,401
Is this rental available?

48
00:05:20,737 --> 00:05:22,488
I don't have a reservation.

49
00:05:25,783 --> 00:05:27,327
I'm sorry, but not today.

50
00:05:27,994 --> 00:05:30,621
I have other guests coming.

51
00:05:30,705 --> 00:05:31,539
Dad!

52
00:05:37,670 --> 00:05:38,838
Hi.

53
00:05:38,921 --> 00:05:40,840
Is she a guest, Dad?

54
00:05:40,923 --> 00:05:41,924
No.

55
00:05:43,926 --> 00:05:45,595
I didn't make a reservation.

56
00:05:46,095 --> 00:05:48,264
I came to stay at a nearby vacation rental

57
00:05:48,348 --> 00:05:52,393
but had a bit of a problem there,
and they recommended this place.

58
00:05:53,853 --> 00:05:56,439
But it looks like you're unavailable too.

59
00:05:57,231 --> 00:06:00,568
Too bad. I came a long way
to stay in this area for about a week.

60
00:06:00,651 --> 00:06:02,320
As you can see, I have guests.

61
00:06:07,867 --> 00:06:09,118
I guess it can't be helped.

62
00:06:10,119 --> 00:06:12,622
Well, we're only staying for dinner.

63
00:06:13,498 --> 00:06:16,584
What are you talking about?
I said they could stay the night--

64
00:06:16,667 --> 00:06:19,420
They told me that their dog was sick.

65
00:06:19,504 --> 00:06:23,091
They are very worried right now,
so I think we should leave after dinner.

66
00:06:24,217 --> 00:06:27,553
If you're okay with us having dinner
out in the yard tonight…

67
00:06:28,304 --> 00:06:29,889
Of course it's okay.

68
00:06:29,972 --> 00:06:31,808
Oh my God! Thank you so much!

69
00:06:35,061 --> 00:06:37,146
You don't have to mind me for now.

70
00:06:37,230 --> 00:06:39,732
-I'll come back in the evening.
-Thank you.

71
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:42,235
I'll bring them over.

72
00:06:42,318 --> 00:06:43,152
Babe!

73
00:07:26,779 --> 00:07:28,698
Are you okay? Here, I'll do it.

74
00:07:31,701 --> 00:07:34,370
-Let me take care of the dishes.
-Okay.

75
00:07:34,454 --> 00:07:35,872
-I'll go wash them.
-Sure.

76
00:07:46,132 --> 00:07:46,966
Dad!

77
00:07:48,968 --> 00:07:50,094
I'll give her the key.

78
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:54,599
I thought Yong-chae would be here too.

79
00:07:55,308 --> 00:07:57,477
-He's in the hospital.
-The hospital?

80
00:07:57,977 --> 00:07:59,145
Yeah, he got hurt.

81
00:08:01,522 --> 00:08:03,232
Let me give her this first.

82
00:09:08,548 --> 00:09:12,134
This place is fantastic.
No wonder Ji-su kept bragging about it.

83
00:09:12,218 --> 00:09:13,928
The trail in the back is nice too.

84
00:09:14,011 --> 00:09:17,056
You can visit anytime.
Feel free to bring your friends too.

85
00:09:17,139 --> 00:09:20,601
Could I come whenever my wife
kicks me out of the house?

86
00:09:20,685 --> 00:09:22,019
Honey!

87
00:09:24,313 --> 00:09:25,481
-Let's drink.
-Yes.

88
00:09:27,775 --> 00:09:30,444
Oh no. I think we were a bit too loud.

89
00:09:30,528 --> 00:09:32,196
Sorry about all the noise!

90
00:09:33,906 --> 00:09:34,740
Excuse me.

91
00:09:36,826 --> 00:09:37,660
Here.

92
00:09:37,743 --> 00:09:39,495
No, you don't have to.

93
00:09:42,039 --> 00:09:43,207
I wanted to thank you.

94
00:09:44,166 --> 00:09:47,795
I was stumped earlier
because I didn't have a place to stay.

95
00:09:50,089 --> 00:09:52,258
This looks great. Thank you.

96
00:09:52,341 --> 00:09:55,136
We bought a cheesecake for dessert.
Would you like some?

97
00:09:55,636 --> 00:09:56,596
I'll go fetch it.

98
00:09:57,096 --> 00:09:58,848
We need new glasses anyway.

99
00:10:01,017 --> 00:10:01,851
Mister.

100
00:10:05,021 --> 00:10:08,524
I'd like to use the record player
in the living room.

101
00:10:11,861 --> 00:10:13,362
Sorry, it's broken.

102
00:10:31,631 --> 00:10:32,465
There.

103
00:10:33,799 --> 00:10:35,343
-We'll get going.
-All right.

104
00:10:36,302 --> 00:10:37,887
Dad. See ya.

105
00:10:39,639 --> 00:10:40,723
You should go inside.

106
00:10:48,564 --> 00:10:49,398
Dad?

107
00:10:50,232 --> 00:10:52,068
Yeah. Have a safe trip home.

108
00:10:52,151 --> 00:10:53,486
-Good night, sir.
-Bye.

109
00:12:09,812 --> 00:12:11,439
What are you doing, honey?

110
00:12:32,251 --> 00:12:33,085
Don't.

111
00:12:34,795 --> 00:12:35,796
That's enough.

112
00:14:29,326 --> 00:14:30,703
Have you had breakfast?

113
00:14:45,175 --> 00:14:46,760
Do you have something to say to me?

114
00:14:55,519 --> 00:14:57,354
You were here with your son last year,

115
00:14:58,230 --> 00:14:59,148
weren't you?

116
00:15:01,984 --> 00:15:02,985
No, I wasn't.

117
00:15:08,991 --> 00:15:10,117
I remember you said

118
00:15:11,744 --> 00:15:13,454
you were afraid of water.

119
00:15:22,004 --> 00:15:24,757
I think you have me confused
with someone else.

120
00:16:36,328 --> 00:16:37,579
Check, please.

121
00:16:38,288 --> 00:16:39,123
Coming!

122
00:16:46,005 --> 00:16:46,839
-Here.
-Okay.

123
00:16:49,216 --> 00:16:51,635
Excuse me, what's up with the bill?

124
00:16:51,719 --> 00:16:52,553
Sorry?

125
00:16:52,636 --> 00:16:55,472
We only had two servings of soup
and two bottles of soju.

126
00:16:57,516 --> 00:17:00,686
-If you give me your card--
-Eun-gyeong, what's wrong?

127
00:17:00,769 --> 00:17:02,688
I think I made a mistake.

128
00:17:07,443 --> 00:17:09,862
I'm so sorry. Let me fix that for you.

129
00:17:10,946 --> 00:17:11,947
Here you go.

130
00:17:12,031 --> 00:17:14,575
Did you think you could get away
with sneaking drinks?

131
00:17:15,367 --> 00:17:17,202
I'm not an idiot, you know.

132
00:17:19,038 --> 00:17:20,205
I'm sorry.

133
00:17:20,289 --> 00:17:23,000
I've let you off until now,
for your husband's sake.

134
00:17:23,625 --> 00:17:27,212
He used to help me out by recommending
my diner to your motel guests.

135
00:17:27,921 --> 00:17:29,423
I felt sorry for the good man.

136
00:17:30,215 --> 00:17:33,010
I'm saying that he's the only reason
I've kept you on.

137
00:17:34,303 --> 00:17:35,304
Goodness me.

138
00:17:35,804 --> 00:17:38,599
This is your last chance.
I'm done lecturing you.

139
00:17:40,059 --> 00:17:43,687
Such a drama queen, I swear.

140
00:17:52,696 --> 00:17:53,530
What's so funny?

141
00:17:53,614 --> 00:17:55,616
Don't pretend you care about me.

142
00:17:56,241 --> 00:17:57,076
What?

143
00:17:59,078 --> 00:18:01,622
Why pretend like you're tolerating me
for my own good?

144
00:18:02,581 --> 00:18:03,415
Eun-gyeong.

145
00:18:03,499 --> 00:18:05,751
You have no idea what I'm going through.

146
00:18:06,585 --> 00:18:10,047
Yet you feel sorry for Sang-jun
and call me a drama queen?

147
00:18:11,423 --> 00:18:12,257
Why?

148
00:18:13,550 --> 00:18:17,638
Why do you feel sorry for my husband?
Are you two seeing each other?

149
00:18:17,721 --> 00:18:18,722
Are you crazy?

150
00:18:18,806 --> 00:18:20,849
I know you were seeing that bar owner.

151
00:18:20,933 --> 00:18:24,144
Just as you've known about my drinking,
I've known about your affair.

152
00:18:24,228 --> 00:18:25,062
Hey!

153
00:18:25,145 --> 00:18:27,231
You didn't hire me
because you felt sorry for me.

154
00:18:27,314 --> 00:18:30,734
I did my job, and you paid me for it.

155
00:18:30,818 --> 00:18:33,695
I might be working for you
and receiving paychecks,

156
00:18:33,779 --> 00:18:35,531
but you can't talk to me like that.

157
00:18:35,614 --> 00:18:37,783
-Eun-gyeong, you're drunk--
-No, I'm not!

158
00:18:40,828 --> 00:18:43,372
Why didn't you just fire me?

159
00:18:44,206 --> 00:18:48,210
You didn't because you love to think
your life isn't as bad as mine.

160
00:18:48,710 --> 00:18:51,547
Did you enjoy patronizing
a bottom-feeder like me?

161
00:18:52,714 --> 00:18:56,969
Why do you act like it's your right
to see me so miserable?

162
00:19:11,733 --> 00:19:13,152
Hi. I'll take it.

163
00:19:16,029 --> 00:19:17,114
Hello?

164
00:19:27,666 --> 00:19:28,750
-Thanks.
-Here.

165
00:19:30,085 --> 00:19:30,919
One for you.

166
00:19:31,003 --> 00:19:35,174
They plan to tear it down and build
a state-of-the-art low-rise apartment.

167
00:19:38,010 --> 00:19:40,345
They're debating between two properties.

168
00:19:40,429 --> 00:19:41,680
I think

169
00:19:42,431 --> 00:19:45,601
you should grab this chance
and knock the price down a bit.

170
00:19:45,684 --> 00:19:47,186
Knock it down by how much?

171
00:19:47,269 --> 00:19:49,104
We'll accept whatever offer.

172
00:19:49,938 --> 00:19:51,190
It's already been a year.

173
00:19:51,273 --> 00:19:54,860
We'll take any price.
Please make sure they pick our building.

174
00:19:55,527 --> 00:19:56,361
All right.

175
00:19:57,696 --> 00:19:59,114
Let's make it happen.

176
00:20:14,963 --> 00:20:15,797
Honey.

177
00:20:17,007 --> 00:20:20,636
Let's not get… too ahead of ourselves.

178
00:20:21,553 --> 00:20:22,971
It'll happen.

179
00:20:27,643 --> 00:20:29,228
Drop me off at the market.

180
00:20:32,648 --> 00:20:34,066
There we go.

181
00:20:40,989 --> 00:20:43,575
Don't just sit there. Dig in.

182
00:20:44,326 --> 00:20:45,160
Let's eat.

183
00:20:56,255 --> 00:20:57,464
It's been a while

184
00:20:58,048 --> 00:21:00,926
since our family's had
a proper meal like this.

185
00:21:02,261 --> 00:21:06,348
Gi-ho got the top score on his midterms,
and we didn't go out to eat to celebrate.

186
00:21:07,391 --> 00:21:08,225
Here.

187
00:21:10,102 --> 00:21:11,270
Eat up, sweetie.

188
00:21:15,524 --> 00:21:19,319
Whether this sale goes through or not…

189
00:21:21,446 --> 00:21:23,031
I'm going to change for the better.

190
00:21:35,460 --> 00:21:36,461
Hello?

191
00:21:37,796 --> 00:21:38,880
Hi, Mi-gyeong.

192
00:21:45,721 --> 00:21:47,973
Hey, it's okay. Stop it.

193
00:21:49,641 --> 00:21:51,018
You don't need to come by.

194
00:21:54,396 --> 00:21:56,148
Seriously, I'm fine.

195
00:21:58,400 --> 00:21:59,735
I'm gonna hang up now.

196
00:22:00,736 --> 00:22:02,571
I was washing the dishes.

197
00:22:03,822 --> 00:22:04,823
Yeah.

198
00:22:05,532 --> 00:22:07,451
Yes, things are gonna get better.

199
00:22:07,951 --> 00:22:11,663
Don't worry. Okay, bye.

200
00:23:16,770 --> 00:23:18,522
It's like throwing away her soul.

201
00:23:18,605 --> 00:23:19,439
What is?

202
00:23:20,732 --> 00:23:22,651
A boozer throwing away her booze.

203
00:23:41,294 --> 00:23:43,046
Have I ever told you about my life?

204
00:23:44,172 --> 00:23:45,006
Nope.

205
00:23:46,925 --> 00:23:48,260
It's a cliché, that's why.

206
00:23:50,178 --> 00:23:51,012
Hey.

207
00:23:52,264 --> 00:23:56,726
A hillbilly troublemaker without a father
went on to become a two-bit gangster.

208
00:23:58,019 --> 00:24:01,773
He now lives off his mother,
who runs a tiny store. Can you beat that?

209
00:24:03,525 --> 00:24:04,401
You win.

210
00:24:15,996 --> 00:24:17,581
Nothing good ever happened to me.

211
00:24:18,874 --> 00:24:20,375
My parents died when I was 17.

212
00:24:21,042 --> 00:24:24,045
I soon realized my gambling addict
of an uncle had run away

213
00:24:24,129 --> 00:24:25,547
with all of their money.

214
00:24:27,966 --> 00:24:31,136
I had no home
and no relatives to take me in.

215
00:24:32,637 --> 00:24:36,057
So I worked at construction sites,
eating and sleeping with the laborers.

216
00:24:37,476 --> 00:24:40,645
You know, those who work in teams,
taking on big construction jobs.

217
00:24:40,729 --> 00:24:41,563
Yeah.

218
00:24:43,231 --> 00:24:44,316
Then…

219
00:24:46,902 --> 00:24:49,905
I got tired of drifting around,
so I got a job at a factory.

220
00:24:51,156 --> 00:24:52,908
This time, the manager ran away.

221
00:24:52,991 --> 00:24:54,826
Shit, you sure knew how to pick 'em.

222
00:24:54,910 --> 00:24:56,077
I know, right?

223
00:24:56,786 --> 00:24:59,956
Back then, I knew a lot of people
all over the country.

224
00:25:01,708 --> 00:25:05,045
I caught the guy who ran away
and started cleaning up his mess.

225
00:25:06,838 --> 00:25:08,840
The head office was impressed,

226
00:25:08,924 --> 00:25:12,427
so they put me in charge of the factory
when I was just a kid, in 1985.

227
00:25:13,011 --> 00:25:13,845
Good for you.

228
00:25:15,263 --> 00:25:19,017
Eun-gyeong was the office assistant
at the head office back then.

229
00:25:20,727 --> 00:25:22,395
It was love at first sight.

230
00:25:22,479 --> 00:25:25,565
I went to see her every day,
but she hated me so much!

231
00:25:28,568 --> 00:25:32,656
Well, compared to me,
your looks are a little lacking.

232
00:25:34,032 --> 00:25:35,158
Crazy bastard!

233
00:25:37,077 --> 00:25:38,787
Oh man.

234
00:25:42,958 --> 00:25:45,335
The year the IMF crisis happened,

235
00:25:46,044 --> 00:25:49,047
I was fortunate enough
to sell off the factory and move here.

236
00:25:50,632 --> 00:25:53,552
Looking back, I've been through so much,

237
00:25:54,427 --> 00:25:56,054
but I overcame it all.

238
00:26:01,476 --> 00:26:02,894
That's how my life has been.

239
00:26:04,062 --> 00:26:07,816
Whenever I reach the stage
where I just can't hold out anymore,

240
00:26:07,899 --> 00:26:09,401
a solution appears.

241
00:26:14,573 --> 00:26:18,743
I hope I can sell
the goddamn motel this time.

242
00:26:31,548 --> 00:26:32,841
Want a drink?

243
00:26:32,924 --> 00:26:34,134
Nah, I gotta go to work.

244
00:26:34,634 --> 00:26:35,468
Now?

245
00:26:36,261 --> 00:26:38,930
They were short for the night shift,
so I volunteered.

246
00:26:42,225 --> 00:26:43,226
See you.

247
00:26:44,603 --> 00:26:45,437
Later.

248
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:49,894
That's it. More!

249
00:28:49,978 --> 00:28:51,896
-Hey, I like soju better.
-Good on you!

250
00:28:51,980 --> 00:28:55,233
-Soju's the best.
-More! Yes, good!

251
00:28:56,901 --> 00:28:57,861
This is it?

252
00:28:58,695 --> 00:29:00,363
I can't bring you these anymore.

253
00:29:00,447 --> 00:29:02,449
Damn. That's not cool.

254
00:29:09,539 --> 00:29:10,373
Cigarettes!

255
00:29:10,457 --> 00:29:13,084
-Give it here, dumbass.
-He remembered to bring them.

256
00:29:14,627 --> 00:29:16,463
-What is it?
-Awesome!

257
00:29:16,546 --> 00:29:17,797
Pass me the cigarettes.

258
00:29:17,881 --> 00:29:19,591
-Give them to me.
-Come on!

259
00:29:20,508 --> 00:29:21,676
-What's that?
-Looks dope.

260
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:22,761
What's this?

261
00:29:22,844 --> 00:29:24,095
-What is that?
-What is it?

262
00:29:24,596 --> 00:29:25,764
Pills?

263
00:29:25,847 --> 00:29:27,348
Something for his health?

264
00:29:28,016 --> 00:29:29,184
He does look sick.

265
00:30:27,784 --> 00:30:30,620
-Run!
-Hurry up!

266
00:30:59,357 --> 00:31:00,608
Gi-ho.

267
00:31:12,787 --> 00:31:16,082
Your son's the one who brought
all the alcohol, cigarettes, and drugs.

268
00:31:16,165 --> 00:31:17,000
Sorry?

269
00:31:18,459 --> 00:31:21,671
The sleeping pills are prescription.
Do you know where he got them?

270
00:31:22,422 --> 00:31:24,173
The kids mixed the pills with alcohol.

271
00:31:24,257 --> 00:31:27,677
They put more pills in each time
until one of them went into shock.

272
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:31,764
The others say that Gi-ho started it
and made them do it.

273
00:31:32,891 --> 00:31:35,977
That's not possible. My son is--

274
00:31:36,060 --> 00:31:39,397
How dare you keep our kids
at the police station this late!

275
00:31:39,898 --> 00:31:41,482
-Detective Cho.
-Where's my son?

276
00:31:46,112 --> 00:31:47,280
-Are you okay?
-You brat!

277
00:31:47,363 --> 00:31:48,197
SANG-JUN

278
00:31:48,281 --> 00:31:50,366
Are you hurt? Who the hell did this?

279
00:31:50,450 --> 00:31:53,786
-Is it that little piece of shit?
-Detective, is he the one?

280
00:31:54,746 --> 00:31:55,830
-Gi-ho!
-What? Why?

281
00:31:56,497 --> 00:31:57,332
Gi-ho!

282
00:31:58,124 --> 00:32:01,044
Gi-ho, are you okay? Gi-ho!

283
00:32:15,350 --> 00:32:17,018
He's just asleep.

284
00:32:47,799 --> 00:32:50,969
MURDER MOTEL
9:00 P.M.

285
00:32:51,886 --> 00:32:53,805
-Don't!
-Open the door.

286
00:32:53,888 --> 00:32:54,973
-Open it!
-Stop!

287
00:32:55,056 --> 00:32:56,808
Gi-ho! Let go of me!

288
00:32:56,891 --> 00:32:59,227
-And what were you doing?
-Cut it out!

289
00:32:59,310 --> 00:33:00,144
Get out.

290
00:33:02,146 --> 00:33:03,773
You little… Where are you going?

291
00:33:03,856 --> 00:33:05,066
-Honey!
-Get back here!

292
00:33:05,149 --> 00:33:07,151
-Hey! I'm talking to you!
-Honey!

293
00:33:07,235 --> 00:33:08,903
He was being bullied!

294
00:33:11,114 --> 00:33:11,948
What?

295
00:33:12,031 --> 00:33:14,325
They made him bring booze
and cigarettes to the motel.

296
00:33:15,243 --> 00:33:16,244
For God's sake.

297
00:33:16,953 --> 00:33:19,122
Then why didn't you fight back like a man?

298
00:33:19,205 --> 00:33:21,541
They said if he didn't,
they'd burn down the motel.

299
00:33:22,667 --> 00:33:27,422
They threatened him, teased him,
and beat him up for months on end!

300
00:33:28,256 --> 00:33:30,717
Do you know who took
the most sleeping pills yesterday?

301
00:33:31,217 --> 00:33:32,510
It was Gi-ho!

302
00:33:35,763 --> 00:33:36,848
Gi-ho!

303
00:34:47,668 --> 00:34:51,589
First, you must prioritize separating
the bully from the victims…

304
00:34:51,672 --> 00:34:53,591
I totally understand your intentions.

305
00:34:53,674 --> 00:34:56,511
-My son is not a delinquent.
-This is a disgrace to the school.

306
00:34:56,594 --> 00:34:59,222
-He's a kid. He'd never drink--
-Mr. Koo?

307
00:35:00,056 --> 00:35:02,391
-That's Gi-ho's dad?
-Are you Gi-ho's dad?

308
00:35:02,475 --> 00:35:04,268
Please calm down, sir.

309
00:35:04,352 --> 00:35:06,813
Are you seriously telling us to calm down?

310
00:35:06,896 --> 00:35:09,732
Look at the state our kids are in,
thanks to his brat…

311
00:35:10,233 --> 00:35:13,903
Mr. Principal, Byeong-u had to go
to the ER a few days ago.

312
00:35:13,986 --> 00:35:17,198
How do you expect us
to trust your institution with our kids?

313
00:35:17,281 --> 00:35:19,992
What kind of school are you running here?

314
00:35:21,077 --> 00:35:23,079
What the… What do you think you're doing?

315
00:35:23,162 --> 00:35:25,081
-Are you insane?
-Mr. Koo!

316
00:35:25,164 --> 00:35:26,666
What's wrong with you?

317
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:30,044
Unbelievable!

318
00:35:30,920 --> 00:35:32,380
What's your deal, punk?

319
00:35:32,463 --> 00:35:35,466
The sale of the motel fell through.

320
00:35:36,509 --> 00:35:37,677
As it turned out,

321
00:35:38,177 --> 00:35:42,181
the developer interested in our motel
was a close friend of that parent.

322
00:35:42,265 --> 00:35:44,433
You didn't need to bring anything.

323
00:35:46,185 --> 00:35:49,355
I heard what happened.
Don't stress about it too much.

324
00:35:50,189 --> 00:35:52,108
Sorry to bother you about this.

325
00:35:53,317 --> 00:35:55,236
No problem, Gyeong-ok.

326
00:35:55,319 --> 00:35:57,989
I'm happy to help
an old classmate of mine.

327
00:35:58,072 --> 00:36:00,491
I don't want special treatment.

328
00:36:03,452 --> 00:36:06,205
Please just make sure
it's investigated fairly.

329
00:36:06,289 --> 00:36:08,457
I will. Have some tea.

330
00:36:09,292 --> 00:36:10,501
I'm counting on you.

331
00:36:12,336 --> 00:36:13,921
-Thank you.
-Don't worry, ma'am.

332
00:36:26,601 --> 00:36:27,435
Sang-jun.

333
00:36:32,690 --> 00:36:33,816
I'm sorry, ma'am.

334
00:36:35,943 --> 00:36:37,403
This, too, will pass.

335
00:36:38,029 --> 00:36:40,031
It is passing as we speak.

336
00:36:43,284 --> 00:36:44,452
Come now, let's go.

337
00:36:56,547 --> 00:36:57,590
Hey, you're up?

338
00:37:05,890 --> 00:37:07,642
Let me get some sleep.

339
00:37:08,809 --> 00:37:11,562
I wanna catch up
on all the sleep I've missed.

340
00:37:11,646 --> 00:37:14,649
Sure, get some sleep.

341
00:37:14,732 --> 00:37:15,650
Don't mind me.

342
00:37:18,653 --> 00:37:19,654
Go on, sleep.

343
00:37:25,243 --> 00:37:28,454
Okay, let's see.
These papers need to be recycled.

344
00:37:30,581 --> 00:37:31,415
Jesus.

345
00:37:35,378 --> 00:37:37,171
Go to sleep. I'm all done now.

346
00:37:40,091 --> 00:37:42,677
Go to sleep! Don't get up. Sleep.

347
00:37:45,846 --> 00:37:47,014
Can't sleep, huh?

348
00:37:47,515 --> 00:37:48,516
-Dude.
-Yeah?

349
00:37:54,105 --> 00:37:55,106
Okay, I'm going.

350
00:38:18,921 --> 00:38:21,132
Well, it's just…

351
00:38:21,215 --> 00:38:23,467
I feel like I need to stretch.

352
00:39:14,185 --> 00:39:15,728
DOCUMENTARY ON JI HYANG-CHEOL TO AIR

00:39:19,690 --> 00:39:21,359
REPORTER YEOM DONG-CHAN

355
00:39:21,442 --> 00:39:23,861
The Ji Hyang-cheol motel
is around here, you know.

356
00:39:24,362 --> 00:39:26,989
-Whoa, Ji Hyang-cheol?
-Want to check it out?

357
00:39:27,073 --> 00:39:29,200
Why would I? That's creepy.

358
00:39:30,242 --> 00:39:34,246
People go there to take pictures.
It's become a tourist spot.

359
00:39:36,957 --> 00:39:38,209
-Let's go now.
-Okay.

360
00:39:48,969 --> 00:39:49,929
Ring us up.

361
00:39:50,471 --> 00:39:51,389
Don't want to.

362
00:39:51,889 --> 00:39:53,099
Sorry?

363
00:39:54,642 --> 00:39:56,352
I'm not selling to you.

364
00:39:56,435 --> 00:39:57,269
What the hell?

365
00:39:58,604 --> 00:39:59,855
Let's go somewhere else.

366
00:39:59,939 --> 00:40:01,524
Let go of me. Hey, man.

367
00:40:05,569 --> 00:40:06,821
Why won't you sell to us?

368
00:40:08,280 --> 00:40:11,617
-Take a look at the sign out front, kid.
-Kid?

369
00:40:14,495 --> 00:40:15,746
Yeah, kid.

370
00:40:16,831 --> 00:40:18,207
Go outside and read the sign.

371
00:40:18,290 --> 00:40:21,293
It says "Jong-du's Supermarket."

372
00:40:22,711 --> 00:40:23,838
Jong-du, that's my name.

373
00:40:24,505 --> 00:40:26,424
Everything in this store is mine.

374
00:40:26,507 --> 00:40:29,677
I get to decide if I sell them or not.
What's your problem, asshole?

375
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:31,929
Wow, that's some funny logic.

376
00:40:33,597 --> 00:40:35,516
Then laugh, you motherfuckers.

377
00:40:35,599 --> 00:40:38,352
What the fuck?
Fine, let's take this outside.

378
00:40:39,228 --> 00:40:40,312
No?

379
00:40:40,396 --> 00:40:42,064
Come out, you trashy thug.

380
00:40:42,148 --> 00:40:44,567
-I'm fucking coming.
-Crazy son of a bitch.

381
00:40:44,650 --> 00:40:46,735
-What a fucking whack job.
-Fuck.

382
00:40:46,819 --> 00:40:48,821
-Get out, asshole!
-Come on, then.

383
00:40:48,904 --> 00:40:50,239
Fucking hell!

384
00:40:50,322 --> 00:40:52,741
Have you lost your mind?
You crazy bastard!

385
00:40:52,825 --> 00:40:54,410
-Let's fucking go!
-Officer!

386
00:40:54,493 --> 00:40:58,080
You got busted, man.
Officer, hurry up and arrest this thug.

387
00:40:58,164 --> 00:40:59,331
What's the problem here?

388
00:40:59,415 --> 00:41:01,750
I was minding my business
when you fucking grabbed me!

389
00:41:01,834 --> 00:41:03,419
You're the one who picked a fight!

390
00:41:03,502 --> 00:41:05,004
-Calm down!
-Fuck!

391
00:41:05,087 --> 00:41:07,840
You are the ones
who said all that shit first!

392
00:41:07,923 --> 00:41:09,425
What the hell did we say?

393
00:41:09,508 --> 00:41:11,343
Take pictures at the motel?

394
00:41:11,844 --> 00:41:14,263
A tourist spot?
You fucking sons of bitches!

395
00:41:14,346 --> 00:41:16,682
I'm gonna fix that foul mouth of yours!

396
00:41:17,808 --> 00:41:18,642
-Stop!
-Hey!

397
00:41:18,726 --> 00:41:21,353
Sorry to interrupt.

398
00:41:24,732 --> 00:41:26,692
I'm Yeom Dong-chan from Joongmin Daily.

399
00:41:31,030 --> 00:41:32,281
I'm writing a story

400
00:41:32,364 --> 00:41:35,409
on the first anniversary
of the Ji Hyang-cheol case.

401
00:41:36,035 --> 00:41:39,830
You were saying that you're willing
to take a picture in front of the motel

402
00:41:39,914 --> 00:41:42,249
where someone
was brutally murdered, right?

403
00:41:42,917 --> 00:41:45,878
I'd like to interview you
and ask why you'd do such a thing.

404
00:41:45,961 --> 00:41:47,338
What the fuck?

405
00:41:48,130 --> 00:41:49,965
What kind of a messed-up town is this?

406
00:41:50,049 --> 00:41:52,218
-Let's just go.
-What a shitty day!

407
00:41:52,301 --> 00:41:54,970
-Don't come back, assholes!
-We won't, asshole!

408
00:41:55,054 --> 00:41:58,182
-Piss off, dickhead!
-Fuck you, you fucking jerk.

409
00:41:59,141 --> 00:42:02,269
-Hey, you're a fucking reporter?
-What?

410
00:42:02,353 --> 00:42:05,189
First anniversary? Of the murder?

411
00:42:05,898 --> 00:42:07,650
Is it a damn birthday party to you?

412
00:42:07,733 --> 00:42:09,235
I'm only here to buy cigarettes.

413
00:42:13,864 --> 00:42:15,407
Fucking hell.

414
00:42:17,243 --> 00:42:19,745
Are you suggesting
I write about what happened?

415
00:42:21,539 --> 00:42:24,083
I only said all that
because those two annoyed me.

416
00:42:26,877 --> 00:42:29,171
Not more annoying than reporters like you.

417
00:42:29,672 --> 00:42:32,466
You shared pictures of the motel
on the news and in the papers

418
00:42:33,092 --> 00:42:35,427
without even blurring them
just to make money.

419
00:42:35,511 --> 00:42:36,762
Wait, but that's…

420
00:42:50,317 --> 00:42:53,737
Do you really think people
would be interested in a story like that?

421
00:42:56,740 --> 00:43:00,703
These cigarettes started selling
like hotcakes when an article revealed

422
00:43:01,203 --> 00:43:02,288
that Ji smokes them.

423
00:43:04,707 --> 00:43:06,500
Only because he smokes them.

424
00:43:09,920 --> 00:43:11,797
I had been smoking these before then.

425
00:43:13,299 --> 00:43:14,133
Anyway,

426
00:43:15,509 --> 00:43:20,306
people don't always pay attention
to the things that are important to you.

427
00:43:22,516 --> 00:43:26,770
And unfortunately, a reporter's job
is to uncover the next big scoop.

428
00:43:33,027 --> 00:43:36,614
But I'd still like to do some interviews.

429
00:43:37,573 --> 00:43:39,199
Do you know the owner of the motel?

430
00:43:40,618 --> 00:43:41,452
I do.

431
00:43:53,172 --> 00:43:55,257
I'm Yeom Dong-chan from Joongmin Daily.

432
00:44:01,764 --> 00:44:03,390
Hey, this guy's on our side.

433
00:44:05,726 --> 00:44:06,560
Please leave.

434
00:44:12,816 --> 00:44:14,068
Come on, man.

435
00:44:16,445 --> 00:44:20,449
The world thinks that the only victims
are the dead ones and their families, huh?

436
00:44:20,532 --> 00:44:22,868
As things are about to die down,
a report comes out,

437
00:44:22,951 --> 00:44:24,787
and Ji gets sentenced to death.

438
00:44:25,287 --> 00:44:29,041
This all happened in one year.
It'll happen next year and the year after.

439
00:44:30,042 --> 00:44:34,296
Things will continue to be rough for you
because Ji won't actually be executed,

440
00:44:34,380 --> 00:44:37,091
and he won't repent
for his sins in silence.

441
00:44:38,509 --> 00:44:41,095
He sends tons of letters
to reporters and the police

442
00:44:41,595 --> 00:44:43,097
and gives interviews nonstop.

443
00:44:43,597 --> 00:44:45,849
His murders are an accomplishment to him.

444
00:44:48,435 --> 00:44:51,105
He'll spend his whole life
blabbing about what he's done.

445
00:44:52,981 --> 00:44:55,317
Your motel will be mentioned
again and again,

446
00:44:56,443 --> 00:44:58,487
but no one will know how that pains you.

447
00:45:02,533 --> 00:45:04,910
Yes, I came here in search of a story,

448
00:45:05,911 --> 00:45:08,956
and I wrote the article
about the first anniversary.

449
00:45:10,165 --> 00:45:12,668
But now I think I know what I left out.

450
00:45:13,168 --> 00:45:15,796
Not the story
of Ji Hyang-cheol the murderer,

451
00:45:16,380 --> 00:45:18,215
not a sensational crime story,

452
00:45:19,800 --> 00:45:20,801
but your story.

453
00:45:23,303 --> 00:45:25,139
Don't you have something you want to say?

454
00:45:33,647 --> 00:45:34,815
Sang-jun.

455
00:45:36,984 --> 00:45:40,821
How about doing… this interview?

456
00:45:42,156 --> 00:45:43,574
Once you do,

457
00:45:44,324 --> 00:45:48,036
maybe people will stop
bothering you so much.

458
00:45:55,294 --> 00:46:01,675
JOONGMIN DAILY
YEOM DONG-CHAN, REPORTER

459
00:46:14,146 --> 00:46:16,565
JONG-DU'S SUPERMARKET OWNER

460
00:46:16,648 --> 00:46:18,484
Earlier, you were a bit too easy on…

461
00:46:21,779 --> 00:46:23,238
Did the interview take place?

462
00:46:29,870 --> 00:46:30,704
No.

463
00:46:38,045 --> 00:46:39,296
-Where are you going?
-Yoon!

464
00:46:40,672 --> 00:46:41,548
Yoon!

465
00:46:46,220 --> 00:46:47,054
Yoon!

466
00:48:58,852 --> 00:49:01,188
I guess it was hard for you
to keep pretending.

467
00:49:09,613 --> 00:49:10,948
Why did you come back?

468
00:49:19,039 --> 00:49:20,874
Should I start growing tomatoes?

469
00:49:22,042 --> 00:49:24,127
I'm really good at making sauces.

470
00:49:29,883 --> 00:49:31,468
Why did I come back?

471
00:49:32,552 --> 00:49:33,929
Good question.

472
00:49:35,013 --> 00:49:37,057
I had no intention of coming back here.

473
00:49:39,142 --> 00:49:41,061
But you popped up in my thoughts.

474
00:49:45,691 --> 00:49:46,942
So I came back,

475
00:49:48,402 --> 00:49:50,529
and you acted like you didn't know me.

476
00:49:52,572 --> 00:49:53,991
As though

477
00:49:55,450 --> 00:49:59,913
you'd spent all this time…
thinking about me and nothing else.

478
00:51:04,644 --> 00:51:06,396
Too bad we can't keep playing, huh?

479
00:51:07,230 --> 00:51:09,232
It can't be helped. It's raining.

480
00:51:09,900 --> 00:51:12,152
Wow! Is that right?

481
00:51:12,652 --> 00:51:14,654
You're a smart boy, Si-hun.

482
00:51:15,655 --> 00:51:18,909
It's Si-hyeon. Ha Si-hyeon.

483
00:52:51,084 --> 00:52:52,002
Can I help you?

484
00:53:16,401 --> 00:53:17,235
Here.

485
00:53:21,198 --> 00:53:22,782
-Thank you.
-Are you okay?

486
00:53:27,204 --> 00:53:28,205
What's going on?

487
00:53:28,288 --> 00:53:30,665
His nose started bleeding,
so we gave him tissues.

488
00:53:49,059 --> 00:53:51,811
The fourth floor. Room 403!
Take the stairs on the left!

489
00:53:51,895 --> 00:53:52,812
Come quickly!

490
00:53:57,651 --> 00:53:59,653
Wake up, ma'am!

491
00:54:43,280 --> 00:54:44,364
This way.
