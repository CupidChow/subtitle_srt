1
00:00:15,807 --> 00:00:18,351
OUT OF ORDER
REPAIR IN PROGRESS

2
00:01:03,354 --> 00:01:05,356
A giant tree fell in a forest…

3
00:01:16,993 --> 00:01:18,995
and no one was around to hear it.

4
00:01:28,129 --> 00:01:29,255
You play StarCraft, huh?

5
00:01:34,052 --> 00:01:37,180
I play Zerg. What about you?

6
00:01:40,934 --> 00:01:41,768
Terran.

7
00:01:42,894 --> 00:01:43,728
What?

8
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:46,314
Terran.

9
00:01:59,494 --> 00:02:00,578
Here's what we'll do.

10
00:02:01,621 --> 00:02:04,707
From this moment on, you're a Ghost.

11
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,671
A Ghost that no one… can see.

12
00:02:20,306 --> 00:02:22,308
Close your eyes and cover your ears.

13
00:03:31,336 --> 00:03:33,421
For goodness' sake.

14
00:03:54,651 --> 00:03:55,526
Did it

15
00:03:57,153 --> 00:03:58,655
make a sound,

16
00:04:00,406 --> 00:04:01,783
or was there nothing but silence?

17
00:04:06,204 --> 00:04:12,210
THE FROG

18
00:04:29,060 --> 00:04:30,979
PACKAGES HERE

19
00:04:39,153 --> 00:04:44,117
JONG-DU'S SUPERMARKET

20
00:08:11,699 --> 00:08:12,742
A GUIDE TO BOXING

21
00:09:01,874 --> 00:09:02,750
The doorbell?

22
00:09:23,521 --> 00:09:25,731
-Maybe you were just hearing things?
-Maybe.

23
00:12:37,256 --> 00:12:38,174
Time-out!

24
00:12:38,257 --> 00:12:41,093
I bet your balls
are even tinier than this.

25
00:12:46,015 --> 00:12:47,433
No signs of anything?

26
00:12:47,933 --> 00:12:48,768
Nope.

27
00:12:49,643 --> 00:12:51,645
-How is she?
-She's near her end.

28
00:12:57,526 --> 00:12:59,361
Want me to shove it down your piehole?

29
00:13:01,238 --> 00:13:03,824
You brat. That's my line!

30
00:13:21,425 --> 00:13:22,927
Two bowls of naengmyeon, please.

31
00:13:23,677 --> 00:13:24,512
You got it.

32
00:13:31,393 --> 00:13:33,646
Don't worry about a thing.
Go get some rest.

33
00:13:34,647 --> 00:13:35,731
-See ya.
-Yeah.

34
00:15:39,897 --> 00:15:41,023
Hands on your head.

35
00:15:53,410 --> 00:15:54,620
Wait!

36
00:15:56,246 --> 00:15:58,582
I'll explain everything.

37
00:15:59,833 --> 00:16:00,668
Everything.

38
00:16:23,857 --> 00:16:25,651
JI HYANG-CHEOL'S GHOSTWRITER FOUND DEAD

39
00:16:30,948 --> 00:16:33,826
The first time I saw the motel
was on the news.

40
00:16:42,459 --> 00:16:45,879
JULY 2001, MY FIRST CASE

41
00:16:47,923 --> 00:16:50,634
I wondered
if my rental would end up just like it,

42
00:16:51,427 --> 00:16:53,929
with its photo left
as a souvenir on someone's desk,

43
00:16:54,847 --> 00:16:58,517
a clip of it doomed to become
a permanent feature on the news.

44
00:17:12,114 --> 00:17:13,365
Can I go home?

45
00:17:15,743 --> 00:17:18,746
DESTINATION: LAKE VIEW MOTEL

46
00:17:32,468 --> 00:17:34,428
I had to see it with my own eyes.

47
00:17:35,387 --> 00:17:39,224
I thought that once I saw the motel,
I'd be able to make a decision.

48
00:17:40,642 --> 00:17:42,519
THIS IS YOON BO-MIN
COULD I TALK TO YOU?

49
00:17:44,021 --> 00:17:46,273
Whether to come clean and be punished…

50
00:17:46,774 --> 00:17:49,526
CAPTAIN YOON BO-MIN

51
00:17:51,236 --> 00:17:54,823
…or cover everything up
and sell the rental.

52
00:17:57,159 --> 00:17:58,535
Whichever it may be.

53
00:18:14,134 --> 00:18:15,594
Are you going somewhere?

54
00:19:16,822 --> 00:19:22,369
PRIVATE PROPERTY
DO NOT ENTER

55
00:19:48,270 --> 00:19:50,022
-Thanks.
-Sure thing.

56
00:19:51,607 --> 00:19:55,444
The son won't sell it.
As for the original owner, well…

57
00:19:57,946 --> 00:20:00,157
Are you aware
of what happened at that motel?

58
00:20:02,242 --> 00:20:03,076
Yes.

59
00:20:04,286 --> 00:20:07,873
This proves… what I've learned
as a longtime realtor.

60
00:20:07,956 --> 00:20:10,959
Every piece of property
eventually finds its owner.

61
00:20:15,380 --> 00:20:19,468
KOO SANG-JUN
ONBIT NURSING HOME, ROOM 103

62
00:20:28,310 --> 00:20:30,312
No, I said no.

63
00:20:37,903 --> 00:20:39,696
-I won.
-Having fun?

64
00:20:58,090 --> 00:20:59,508
NAME: KOO SANG-JUN

65
00:21:10,352 --> 00:21:11,436
Can I help you?

66
00:21:12,437 --> 00:21:13,272
Hello.

67
00:21:14,314 --> 00:21:15,816
I'd like to meet the person here.

68
00:21:17,192 --> 00:21:18,193
That would be me.

69
00:21:22,155 --> 00:21:24,825
Then do you own the motel--

70
00:21:25,784 --> 00:21:28,829
Welcome.
I was wondering when you'd get here.

71
00:21:32,082 --> 00:21:33,542
Are you here to see the lake?

72
00:21:34,167 --> 00:21:35,002
Sorry?

73
00:21:38,922 --> 00:21:42,009
Please wait outside for a moment.
I'm still cleaning the room.

74
00:21:45,387 --> 00:21:47,889
-Fun! Yes, it's fun.
-Are you having fun?

75
00:21:47,973 --> 00:21:49,308
No, don't bother.

76
00:21:49,975 --> 00:21:52,311
He's done cleaning. Shall we go on in?

77
00:21:52,394 --> 00:21:53,729
No, I don't want to!

78
00:21:53,812 --> 00:21:55,480
-I don't want to.
-Let's go. Go on.

79
00:21:55,564 --> 00:21:56,606
Let's go in.

80
00:21:56,690 --> 00:21:58,358
-In you go.
-Thank you!

81
00:21:58,442 --> 00:21:59,526
Go.

82
00:22:35,103 --> 00:22:41,151
UI-SEON

83
00:22:42,027 --> 00:22:42,861
Thank you.

84
00:22:49,868 --> 00:22:51,078
Was that your daughter?

85
00:22:51,578 --> 00:22:52,496
Yes.

86
00:22:55,040 --> 00:22:56,375
I have a son.

87
00:22:57,876 --> 00:23:00,420
I wish he'd give me a call
from time to time.

88
00:23:04,132 --> 00:23:05,384
He never calls you?

89
00:23:08,387 --> 00:23:12,140
I had him stay with his aunt for a while
because something happened at my motel,

90
00:23:13,392 --> 00:23:15,352
but I forgot her phone number

91
00:23:16,186 --> 00:23:17,771
and lost my cell phone too.

92
00:23:19,689 --> 00:23:20,941
At your motel?

93
00:23:22,234 --> 00:23:23,235
A couple days ago…

94
00:23:25,320 --> 00:23:26,655
a crazy man stayed at the motel.

95
00:23:29,241 --> 00:23:30,325
A couple days ago?

96
00:23:36,665 --> 00:23:37,749
Your son.

97
00:23:39,626 --> 00:23:40,961
How old is he?

98
00:23:44,464 --> 00:23:45,632
He's 13.

99
00:23:54,349 --> 00:23:56,017
I actually run a motel myself.

100
00:23:59,813 --> 00:24:00,689
And…

101
00:24:02,941 --> 00:24:04,151
there's a crazy person…

102
00:24:06,528 --> 00:24:08,029
staying at my motel right now.

103
00:24:10,157 --> 00:24:13,618
I haven't decided what to do about it yet.

104
00:24:18,707 --> 00:24:19,708
In that case…

105
00:24:22,294 --> 00:24:23,170
don't trust anyone.

106
00:24:26,298 --> 00:24:29,134
I trusted… that others would sympathize

107
00:24:30,427 --> 00:24:34,764
with what my Eun-gyeong and Gi-ho
were going through.

108
00:24:40,145 --> 00:24:41,771
Don't ever believe that.

109
00:24:44,191 --> 00:24:47,360
That's the only way
your daughter will live.

110
00:25:01,750 --> 00:25:03,960
Wait!

111
00:25:09,090 --> 00:25:12,093
Do you want to have
that crazy person killed?

112
00:25:13,011 --> 00:25:13,845
What?

113
00:25:15,847 --> 00:25:17,557
He told me to keep it a secret.

114
00:25:19,100 --> 00:25:21,436
But I feel sorry for you.

115
00:25:24,773 --> 00:25:26,525
Ask this gentleman I know for help.

116
00:25:27,442 --> 00:25:30,946
Even if the crazy man is in prison,
he can get him out and kill him.

117
00:25:31,613 --> 00:25:33,073
There are lots of ways to do it.

118
00:25:34,074 --> 00:25:35,951
He told me not to worry about it anymore.

119
00:25:36,034 --> 00:25:36,868
Mr. Koo.

120
00:25:36,952 --> 00:25:38,119
"I'll kill him, Father."

121
00:25:38,787 --> 00:25:41,206
-What?
-"I'm going to kill Ji Hyang-cheol."

122
00:25:41,706 --> 00:25:42,874
"I'll kill--"

123
00:25:52,050 --> 00:25:54,803
"I will…"

124
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:01,601
VISITORS' LOG
WARD 1

125
00:26:05,230 --> 00:26:09,150
He calls his son "the gentleman"
because he doesn't recognize him.

126
00:26:10,318 --> 00:26:13,321
JULY 30 - KOO GI-HO
JULY 30 - JEON YEONG-HA

127
00:26:18,785 --> 00:26:21,663
ROOM 201, LAKE VIEW MOTEL
17 DONGHO-RI, DONGHO-MYEON, GICHEON-GUN

128
00:27:20,930 --> 00:27:21,765
Rascal.

129
00:27:25,143 --> 00:27:28,063
What he said about killing…
Did he really mean it?

130
00:27:39,240 --> 00:27:42,202
I wanted to see the story of the motel
through to the end.

131
00:27:45,664 --> 00:27:48,667
But why didn't you tell me that
from the start?

132
00:27:51,711 --> 00:27:53,713
Because I couldn't speak then.

133
00:28:20,699 --> 00:28:21,700
CAPTAIN YOON BO-MIN

134
00:28:21,783 --> 00:28:23,034
A cop…

135
00:28:58,820 --> 00:28:59,654
Hey, Uncle.

136
00:29:02,323 --> 00:29:03,491
I'll head over now.

137
00:31:48,531 --> 00:31:50,533
UI-SEON

138
00:31:56,831 --> 00:31:57,999
He just arrived.

139
00:31:58,708 --> 00:32:00,668
Looks like it'll take place in her room.

140
00:32:04,130 --> 00:32:05,548
Did you see him?

141
00:32:09,218 --> 00:32:10,553
He's waiting in the bathroom.

142
00:32:11,137 --> 00:32:13,973
There are two prison guards
and four police officers.

143
00:32:14,807 --> 00:32:16,100
-And the chair?
-What?

144
00:32:23,191 --> 00:32:25,902
It won't take long.
You just need to be outside for an hour.

145
00:32:26,486 --> 00:32:27,612
-Please, ma'am.
-Let go!

146
00:32:27,695 --> 00:32:29,864
What are you doing, you old fogey?

147
00:32:29,948 --> 00:32:32,367
Nurse, you can go. I'll handle this.

148
00:32:32,909 --> 00:32:33,743
Just go.

149
00:32:36,079 --> 00:32:38,247
Heck, we need to get out of here!

150
00:32:39,123 --> 00:32:41,000
It's gonna get ugly in here.

151
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:44,504
Damn it, just do as I say!

152
00:32:46,798 --> 00:32:48,132
You immature fool.

153
00:32:53,554 --> 00:32:57,392
Even at this age,
you never stop stirring up trouble!

154
00:32:59,394 --> 00:33:01,813
-I'm not going to sit back.
-No.

155
00:33:01,896 --> 00:33:04,983
Mom, you can't tell anybody.
If you do, Gi-ho will…

156
00:33:05,066 --> 00:33:06,234
For the love of…

157
00:33:08,903 --> 00:33:11,322
We'd really appreciate your cooperation.

158
00:33:11,406 --> 00:33:14,742
Yes, if you could just give us a moment…

159
00:33:22,667 --> 00:33:27,338
Actually, the patient is fine to stay.
Sir, if you wouldn't mind stepping out…

160
00:33:27,422 --> 00:33:28,256
I do mind.

161
00:33:28,339 --> 00:33:29,173
Sorry?

162
00:33:29,257 --> 00:33:30,091
I mean,

163
00:33:31,759 --> 00:33:33,845
I can't leave my mother by herself.

164
00:33:34,429 --> 00:33:36,180
This guy must be a real piece of work.

165
00:33:36,264 --> 00:33:38,516
-It's not like that, sir.
-Bullshit!

166
00:33:39,517 --> 00:33:43,104
Why else would he be accompanied
by cops and prison guards?

167
00:33:43,187 --> 00:33:44,439
A heinous criminal, is he?

168
00:33:46,441 --> 00:33:47,942
You see, I'm not proud of it,

169
00:33:48,026 --> 00:33:49,944
but I got a criminal record,

170
00:33:50,028 --> 00:33:52,280
so I kinda know
how the correctional system works.

171
00:33:52,363 --> 00:33:53,531
Jesus.

172
00:33:53,614 --> 00:33:55,158
Look at her!

173
00:33:55,241 --> 00:33:58,161
You scared my sick mother,
and you dare ask for cooperation?

174
00:33:58,244 --> 00:34:00,913
Without explaining a single thing
about what's going on?

175
00:34:00,997 --> 00:34:02,832
Are criminals the only ones with rights?

176
00:34:02,915 --> 00:34:05,543
We're only doing this
in case of a contingency--

177
00:34:05,626 --> 00:34:07,045
Contingency, my ass!

178
00:34:07,545 --> 00:34:08,629
I don't care.

179
00:34:11,758 --> 00:34:15,011
Draw this curtain. And this one too.

180
00:34:15,511 --> 00:34:16,429
And this chair.

181
00:34:17,346 --> 00:34:19,015
That man can take this chair

182
00:34:20,058 --> 00:34:22,560
and sit right here, can't he?

183
00:34:50,213 --> 00:34:52,632
Sure, let's do that.
If you could step aside now…

184
00:34:55,343 --> 00:34:57,178
Please help us, sir.

185
00:35:07,647 --> 00:35:08,481
All set.

186
00:35:10,942 --> 00:35:14,362
Throw away the phone like I told you.
I'll call you later.

187
00:35:14,862 --> 00:35:15,696
Uncle,

188
00:35:16,405 --> 00:35:17,448
thanks for everything.

189
00:35:37,385 --> 00:35:39,804
I really shouldn't do this, but…

190
00:35:44,058 --> 00:35:44,892
Ta-da!

191
00:35:45,560 --> 00:35:47,562
Put this on. It's a gift from me.

192
00:35:52,608 --> 00:35:53,609
Let me.

193
00:36:00,658 --> 00:36:03,411
She might be unconscious
and unable to recognize you,

194
00:36:03,494 --> 00:36:05,163
but you haven't seen her in ages.

195
00:36:05,872 --> 00:36:07,748
You can't show up in your prison uniform.

196
00:36:09,917 --> 00:36:10,751
Here you go.

197
00:36:38,905 --> 00:36:42,408
How nice you get to say goodbye
to your mother before she passes on.

198
00:36:43,659 --> 00:36:45,870
All those years
of being a model inmate paid off.

199
00:36:51,918 --> 00:36:53,002
You're very kind.

200
00:36:53,502 --> 00:36:55,421
Come on. That's nothing between us.

201
00:37:02,762 --> 00:37:05,014
We're ready. Let's go.

202
00:37:08,434 --> 00:37:09,268
What's going on?

203
00:37:34,168 --> 00:37:35,002
Thank you.

204
00:37:56,274 --> 00:37:57,275
It's me, Mother.

205
00:38:13,708 --> 00:38:14,542
Mother.

206
00:39:13,351 --> 00:39:16,354
Why is this thing on the ground?

207
00:39:56,519 --> 00:39:57,353
What was that?

208
00:39:58,270 --> 00:39:59,397
What happened?

209
00:40:00,189 --> 00:40:02,441
There was a gunshot from outside.

210
00:40:02,525 --> 00:40:03,692
A gunshot?

211
00:40:04,193 --> 00:40:05,027
Are you okay?

212
00:40:08,656 --> 00:40:10,658
-The building across the road!
-Let's go!

213
00:40:12,576 --> 00:40:13,661
-Call for backup!
-Okay.

214
00:40:13,744 --> 00:40:16,497
I'm gonna go report this.
Keep an eye on him.

215
00:40:16,580 --> 00:40:17,498
Yes, sir.

216
00:40:30,761 --> 00:40:31,595
Are you all right?

217
00:40:56,662 --> 00:40:58,164
-Are you?
-Yes. Are you hurt--

218
00:41:12,595 --> 00:41:15,014
Three minutes.
That's how much I need in case I fail.

219
00:41:50,674 --> 00:41:52,134
You son of a bitch!

220
00:41:56,597 --> 00:41:57,473
Die!

221
00:42:03,646 --> 00:42:05,648
Come here, you fucking bastard!

222
00:42:05,731 --> 00:42:08,275
I'm gonna kill you right here,
motherfucker!

223
00:42:11,612 --> 00:42:13,197
Where do you think you're going?

224
00:43:08,752 --> 00:43:11,589
-I'm sorry. Are you okay?
-Sorry.

225
00:43:58,636 --> 00:43:59,637
Shit!

226
00:44:15,069 --> 00:44:15,903
You can't go.

227
00:44:16,737 --> 00:44:17,571
What?

228
00:44:18,947 --> 00:44:19,782
You can't.

229
00:44:30,292 --> 00:44:31,460
Mother!

230
00:44:52,773 --> 00:44:53,607
What are you?

231
00:44:57,027 --> 00:44:58,028
Who are you?

232
00:45:02,866 --> 00:45:03,951
The Ghost.

233
00:45:25,347 --> 00:45:27,433
Close your eyes and cover your ears.

234
00:46:01,258 --> 00:46:02,342
What the…

235
00:49:13,784 --> 00:49:15,202
That's just a toy.

236
00:49:32,052 --> 00:49:33,136
Why?

237
00:49:33,220 --> 00:49:36,014
Were you too ashamed
to report you'd been tied up here?

238
00:49:37,391 --> 00:49:38,642
So you're arresting me?

239
00:49:51,488 --> 00:49:53,573
JI HYANG-CHEOL AUTOBIOGRAPHY
A CONFESSION OF MURDERS

240
00:49:55,742 --> 00:49:56,660
I found them.

241
00:50:01,915 --> 00:50:07,421
The letters written by Ji Hyang-cheol
and the draft of the autobiography.

242
00:50:09,214 --> 00:50:10,382
It's all over now.

243
00:50:14,511 --> 00:50:15,345
Mr. Koo Gi-ho.

244
00:50:15,429 --> 00:50:19,725
Why would I have come back here…
if I wanted to turn myself in?

245
00:50:32,571 --> 00:50:34,239
Can't you see what's going on?

246
00:51:49,940 --> 00:51:53,443
It made no sense
for him to just let me go.

247
00:51:54,653 --> 00:51:58,990
Not only did he believe I was a cop,
but I also knew where his hideout was.

248
00:52:36,570 --> 00:52:37,571
I told you to go.

249
00:52:37,654 --> 00:52:39,906
Mr. Koo, calm down.

250
00:52:44,077 --> 00:52:44,911
Give it.

251
00:52:46,621 --> 00:52:48,707
You said it was all over, so why?

252
00:52:49,499 --> 00:52:51,168
-Why what?
-Why try to kill yourself?

253
00:52:51,251 --> 00:52:52,419
What's it to you?

254
00:52:58,925 --> 00:52:59,926
I'll go

255
00:53:01,136 --> 00:53:02,596
if you tell me everything.

256
00:53:10,604 --> 00:53:12,439
You were going to die alone quietly.

257
00:53:15,025 --> 00:53:16,693
That's why you let me go.

258
00:53:19,529 --> 00:53:21,406
This is the final part of your plan.

259
00:53:23,450 --> 00:53:24,868
I'll let you finish it.

260
00:53:26,828 --> 00:53:28,163
So tell me everything.

261
00:53:32,584 --> 00:53:34,169
You want me to leave my last words?

262
00:53:35,712 --> 00:53:36,546
No, I mean--

263
00:53:36,630 --> 00:53:38,590
What difference would that make?

264
00:53:41,092 --> 00:53:43,178
You'd feel better if you let it out--

265
00:53:43,261 --> 00:53:47,641
I'm not gonna leave a few words…
before I die like someone did.

266
00:53:50,477 --> 00:53:51,978
I have no confession to make…

267
00:53:54,731 --> 00:53:56,107
no last words,

268
00:53:57,984 --> 00:53:59,277
not a single word.

269
00:54:17,170 --> 00:54:18,004
Fine.

270
00:54:20,840 --> 00:54:22,300
Let me leave with my phone.

271
00:54:27,264 --> 00:54:28,765
Is this Onbit Nursing Home?

272
00:54:29,307 --> 00:54:30,850
Can I talk to Mr. Koo in Room 103?

273
00:54:30,934 --> 00:54:33,270
-What do you think--
-I'm Koo Gi-ho, his guardian.

274
00:54:33,353 --> 00:54:35,188
It's an urgent family matter.

275
00:54:39,985 --> 00:54:41,987
Do you have nothing to say to your father?

276
00:54:44,114 --> 00:54:44,948
Gi-ho.

277
00:54:52,122 --> 00:54:52,956
Hello?

278
00:54:55,125 --> 00:54:56,209
Mr. Koo Sang-jun.

279
00:54:56,876 --> 00:54:58,753
Go ahead and talk. Your son is listening.

280
00:55:03,258 --> 00:55:04,092
My boy.

281
00:55:07,095 --> 00:55:09,097
Are you being good at your aunt's?

282
00:55:17,647 --> 00:55:20,066
Stay with your aunt for a few more days.

283
00:55:23,486 --> 00:55:27,240
Mom and Dad have some things
to take care of at the motel.

284
00:55:29,743 --> 00:55:30,744
I'm sorry.

285
00:55:32,329 --> 00:55:33,997
Once we're done here,

286
00:55:34,873 --> 00:55:36,458
Dad will…

287
00:55:42,756 --> 00:55:43,757
Dad will…

288
00:55:43,840 --> 00:55:45,717
You little-- Get back here!

289
00:55:45,800 --> 00:55:48,219
-Honey!
-Hey! Koo Gi-ho!

290
00:55:52,807 --> 00:55:55,560
Fine, it's all my fault!
Want me to apologize for everything?

291
00:55:55,643 --> 00:55:57,479
Should I be sorry
for bringing you to this town?

292
00:55:57,562 --> 00:55:59,814
Or asking you to marry me
in the first place?

293
00:56:00,565 --> 00:56:02,692
What is it that you think
I've done so wrong?

294
00:56:02,776 --> 00:56:03,610
Are you done?

295
00:56:14,621 --> 00:56:15,789
Dad will…

296
00:56:20,293 --> 00:56:21,961
deal with it in no time…

297
00:56:25,090 --> 00:56:26,257
and come get you.

298
00:56:27,717 --> 00:56:28,718
Until then,

299
00:56:29,969 --> 00:56:31,763
even if you miss Mom and Dad,

300
00:56:32,514 --> 00:56:35,266
you've got to stay strong, okay?

301
00:56:42,732 --> 00:56:46,152
You sound so down, sport.

302
00:56:47,153 --> 00:56:49,572
Wait, what was that thing?

303
00:56:49,656 --> 00:56:52,659
That thing you wanted, Gi-ho.

304
00:56:56,663 --> 00:56:58,415
The video game.

305
00:56:58,498 --> 00:57:00,500
Why do you remember that?

306
00:57:01,835 --> 00:57:03,837
That game.

307
00:57:05,130 --> 00:57:06,881
I'll buy it for you.

308
00:57:09,259 --> 00:57:13,763
Don't tell Mom, okay?

309
00:57:49,632 --> 00:57:52,177
When I heard that he was writing a memoir,

310
00:57:53,678 --> 00:57:54,929
I was disgusted.

311
00:57:57,265 --> 00:58:01,060
My mom died in the room
that bastard had stayed in…

312
00:58:03,771 --> 00:58:04,981
and my dad is trapped

313
00:58:06,441 --> 00:58:08,193
in the past forever because of him.

314
00:58:10,528 --> 00:58:11,946
So I blindly went to see him.

315
00:58:13,156 --> 00:58:16,576
I told him I heard the rumors
and that I'd like to publish his memoir.

316
00:58:18,077 --> 00:58:20,330
He told me his ghostwriter's address.

317
00:58:24,792 --> 00:58:26,461
When I found the dead ghostwriter…

318
00:58:29,339 --> 00:58:30,590
I didn't call the cops.

319
00:58:33,426 --> 00:58:36,095
I took the letters
and the draft copy and left.

320
00:58:40,850 --> 00:58:43,061
I locked myself up in this house for days,

321
00:58:44,938 --> 00:58:46,022
reading them all.

322
00:58:48,274 --> 00:58:49,108
But…

323
00:58:52,612 --> 00:58:55,031
after reading it,
a strange feeling came over me.

324
00:58:56,449 --> 00:58:57,450
It wasn't anger.

325
00:58:58,952 --> 00:59:00,912
I had no idea what I was feeling.

326
00:59:05,667 --> 00:59:10,004
Ji Hyang-cheol was ready
to leave the hell he had created.

327
00:59:12,799 --> 00:59:17,470
I realized… enough time had passed for him
to look back and reflect on his life.

328
00:59:19,806 --> 00:59:20,640
As for me…

329
00:59:25,270 --> 00:59:27,438
with his letters clutched in my hand…

330
00:59:33,987 --> 00:59:36,573
it was clear
I hadn't taken a single step forward.

331
01:00:04,601 --> 01:00:05,435
Get changed.

332
01:00:08,021 --> 01:00:08,855
Take a shower.

333
01:00:58,905 --> 01:01:00,073
What are you doing?

334
01:01:02,659 --> 01:01:03,868
You and I were drinking.

335
01:01:06,663 --> 01:01:08,539
You'd been planning this for a long time.

336
01:01:09,832 --> 01:01:11,584
You even prepared an escape route.

337
01:01:13,378 --> 01:01:16,964
The only thing you need now… is an alibi.

338
01:01:18,675 --> 01:01:19,842
What?

339
01:01:23,846 --> 01:01:25,390
The beer cans in the sink.

340
01:01:27,350 --> 01:01:28,851
You and I drank them last night.

341
01:01:30,144 --> 01:01:32,480
I came here
because I wanted to buy your motel,

342
01:01:33,106 --> 01:01:36,025
and I got your phone number
from the realtor.

343
01:01:37,110 --> 01:01:39,404
We met up at the motel, came here,

344
01:01:41,364 --> 01:01:42,865
talked and drank all night…

345
01:01:45,368 --> 01:01:46,953
and just woke up now.

346
01:01:49,872 --> 01:01:51,958
Weren't you waiting for me
to turn myself in?

347
01:02:01,050 --> 01:02:02,635
Like I said, I'm not a cop.

348
01:02:03,970 --> 01:02:05,471
But you never said that.

349
01:02:35,418 --> 01:02:36,711
Where are you, Yeong-ha?

350
01:02:36,794 --> 01:02:39,547
I'm at your place right now.
Is that the woman who…

351
01:02:39,630 --> 01:02:40,882
YONG-CHAE

352
01:02:42,175 --> 01:02:45,678
This device is turned off.
Your call will be directed to voicemail.

353
01:02:45,762 --> 01:02:48,139
You will be charged after the beep.

354
01:02:51,559 --> 01:02:52,393
UI-SEON

355
01:03:22,632 --> 01:03:23,716
Hello?

356
01:03:28,638 --> 01:03:29,555
Mister?

357
01:03:31,140 --> 01:03:33,726
Mister!

358
01:03:36,062 --> 01:03:38,314
Mister…

359
01:03:38,898 --> 01:03:39,816
Mister.

360
01:03:41,901 --> 01:03:42,902
Tell me.

361
01:03:44,612 --> 01:03:46,322
When are you coming back?

362
01:03:57,792 --> 01:04:00,920
This device is turned off.
Your call will be directed to voicemail.

363
01:04:03,005 --> 01:04:04,715
That's when I finally realized.

364
01:04:12,682 --> 01:04:15,852
Neither coming clean
nor covering everything up

365
01:04:17,270 --> 01:04:19,021
was an option.

366
01:04:27,530 --> 01:04:29,282
I had to protect what mattered…

367
01:04:31,951 --> 01:04:33,369
to the bitter end.
