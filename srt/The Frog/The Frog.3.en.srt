[dramatic music playing]

3
00:00:25,734 --> 00:00:27,652
[Gi-ho] If a tree falls in a forest…

4
00:00:30,613 --> 00:00:32,407
and no one is around to hear it…

5
00:00:39,456 --> 00:00:40,623
does it make a sound?

6
00:00:41,499 --> 00:00:42,917
Or is there nothing

7
00:00:43,835 --> 00:00:44,919
but silence?

8
00:00:52,260 --> 00:00:53,720
[boy] You're late, loser.

9
00:00:53,803 --> 00:01:00,769
THE FROG

10
00:01:01,811 --> 00:01:03,730
[scribbling]

11
00:01:10,779 --> 00:01:12,781
[indistinct chattering]

12
00:01:13,448 --> 00:01:14,616
Oh, hi!

13
00:01:17,035 --> 00:01:19,412
-Will you join us for lunch, Director?
-Oh, you go ahead.

14
00:01:19,496 --> 00:01:20,997
-Okay. See you after.
-Enjoy your lunch.

15
00:01:21,081 --> 00:01:21,956
Thank you.

16
00:01:28,755 --> 00:01:30,632
-[sighs]
-[Yeong-ha] What?

17
00:01:31,591 --> 00:01:32,634
You got a tan.

18
00:01:32,717 --> 00:01:34,135
[chuckles] Did I?

19
00:01:39,516 --> 00:01:41,935
[man 1] Just use the place
as a vacation home instead.

20
00:01:42,811 --> 00:01:44,979
Running that type of business at our age?

21
00:01:45,814 --> 00:01:47,482
I'm teaching my wife how to run it.

22
00:01:47,565 --> 00:01:50,485
She told me
she wants to work close to nature.

23
00:01:50,568 --> 00:01:52,070
But the hospital's far, no?

24
00:01:52,153 --> 00:01:54,197
Well, for now,
she has regular appointments.

25
00:01:54,948 --> 00:01:58,284
They told me they offered you
a leave of absence instead of quitting.

26
00:01:59,619 --> 00:02:02,372
I mean, either way, we're all contractors.

27
00:02:03,706 --> 00:02:05,208
What's the point in taking it?

28
00:02:06,292 --> 00:02:08,670
-Can we get a refill on the sides?
-[waitress] Right away.

29
00:02:10,046 --> 00:02:12,966
Everyone I know who decided
to build a house out there

30
00:02:13,925 --> 00:02:15,718
ended up returning to the city.

31
00:02:18,054 --> 00:02:19,514
I'm selling my apartment.

32
00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:24,144
-I have nothing here.
-You shouldn't do that.

33
00:02:24,853 --> 00:02:27,522
Yeong-ha!
You should keep it even if you quit.

34
00:02:27,605 --> 00:02:30,066
If you sell your apartment
in Seoul right now,

35
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:33,486
it's the same as throwing your money away.
Call your realtor now.

36
00:02:33,570 --> 00:02:34,988
-[Yeong-ha chuckles]
-No?

37
00:02:36,573 --> 00:02:37,574
How about this?

38
00:02:38,992 --> 00:02:41,286
I got a company
that I can talk to for you.

39
00:02:43,121 --> 00:02:45,373
This food is amazing.

40
00:02:46,583 --> 00:02:47,542
[sighs]

41
00:03:02,015 --> 00:03:03,099
Oh.

42
00:03:03,183 --> 00:03:04,309
[Yeong-ha] Three months.

43
00:03:06,436 --> 00:03:07,770
The doctors said

44
00:03:08,438 --> 00:03:11,065
my wife might be gone in three months.

45
00:03:14,152 --> 00:03:16,487
I'd happily be in debt
if it bought her more time.

46
00:03:16,571 --> 00:03:18,406
[wife] Here. Have a glass of juice.

47
00:03:18,489 --> 00:03:21,367
-[Yeong-ha] But that vacation rental…
-You did an excellent job. Thank you.

48
00:03:21,451 --> 00:03:23,328
…was the only thing I could give her.

49
00:03:24,078 --> 00:03:25,246
Isn't it beautiful?

50
00:03:25,330 --> 00:03:26,956
[man 1] Oh, it is incredible.

51
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:29,834
[Yeong-ha] And now
it's the only thing I have left.

52
00:03:30,543 --> 00:03:32,045
Yeong-ha, hey.

53
00:03:32,128 --> 00:03:33,338
Oh, just a minute.

54
00:03:44,641 --> 00:03:45,683
[sighs]

55
00:03:45,767 --> 00:03:47,769

[unsettling music playing]

67
00:05:09,309 --> 00:05:10,393
How can…

68
00:05:13,521 --> 00:05:15,481
Uh, how can I assist you?

69
00:05:16,899 --> 00:05:18,484
I'm looking to stay the night.

70
00:05:20,695 --> 00:05:22,697
I couldn't call to book in advance.

71
00:05:25,783 --> 00:05:27,577
[Yeong-ha] I can't do tonight.

72
00:05:28,077 --> 00:05:29,162
I'm sorry.

73
00:05:29,245 --> 00:05:31,539
-I have guests coming.
-[daughter] Dad!

74
00:05:37,545 --> 00:05:38,671
Hello.

75
00:05:38,755 --> 00:05:40,840
Hey, Dad. Did she book here?

76
00:05:40,923 --> 00:05:41,924
No.

77
00:05:43,801 --> 00:05:45,762
I don't have a reservation.

78
00:05:45,845 --> 00:05:48,264
I was supposed to stay at another rental,

79
00:05:48,348 --> 00:05:51,809
but, um, there was an issue,
so they said I should try this place.

80
00:05:52,393 --> 00:05:53,644
[daughter] Oh. [chuckles]

81
00:05:53,728 --> 00:05:56,439
But I see
you don't have a room here either.

82
00:05:57,231 --> 00:06:00,568
I live pretty far away,
and I was planning to stay for a week.

83
00:06:00,651 --> 00:06:02,320
I am not able to accommodate you, ma'am.

84
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:08,785
[sighs, tuts] All right, no problem.

85
00:06:10,119 --> 00:06:12,830
Well, actually,
we'll only be here for dinner.

86
00:06:13,498 --> 00:06:16,584
What do you mean?
I told you that they could stay the night.

87
00:06:16,667 --> 00:06:19,545
-Why--
-Well, Ji-su's parents have a sick puppy.

88
00:06:19,629 --> 00:06:23,091
They're so worried, so we decided
it'd be best for us to leave after dinner.

89
00:06:24,509 --> 00:06:27,553
If we would still be able to have dinner,
we could happily accommodate you.

90
00:06:28,221 --> 00:06:29,764
Oh, of course!

91
00:06:29,847 --> 00:06:32,517
Oh my goodness.
Thank you so much. [laughs]

92
00:06:34,894 --> 00:06:37,146
Don't mind me at all.
I'll come back later.

93
00:06:37,230 --> 00:06:40,149
-And enjoy your dinner.
-[daughter] Thanks, we will.

94
00:06:40,858 --> 00:06:43,027
I'll be right back. Oppa!

00:07:26,654 --> 00:07:28,698
[Ji-su] You okay? Here, let me do it.

99

[sighs]

100
00:07:31,534 --> 00:07:32,452
I will…

101
00:07:32,535 --> 00:07:34,454
-[Ji-su] Okay.
-I'll wash those dishes.

102
00:07:34,537 --> 00:07:35,872
-Yeah, I'll do it.
-[Ji-su] Thanks.

[daughter] Dad!

106
00:07:48,968 --> 00:07:50,094
I'll go give her the key.

107
00:07:52,597 --> 00:07:54,599
I thought Yong-chae would be here too.

108
00:07:55,308 --> 00:07:57,894
-He's in the hospital.
-He's what?

109
00:07:57,977 --> 00:08:00,271
-It's a minor injury.
-Oh.

110
00:08:01,481 --> 00:08:03,065
Oh, I'll go give her this.

111

116
00:09:08,548 --> 00:09:10,758
[Ji-su's father] No wonder
Ji-su kept bragging about it.

117
00:09:10,841 --> 00:09:12,093
This place is amazing!

118
00:09:12,176 --> 00:09:14,095
[Ji-su's mother]
There are nice walking paths too.

119
00:09:14,178 --> 00:09:17,056
Come visit anytime.
Feel free to bring your friends too.

120
00:09:17,139 --> 00:09:20,518
Actually, you mind if I come by
when the wife kicks me out?

121
00:09:20,601 --> 00:09:22,019
-Goodness, honey!
-[all laughing]

122
00:09:24,397 --> 00:09:26,023
-[Ji-su's father] Cheers!
-Cheers, all.

123
00:09:27,733 --> 00:09:30,486
[Ji-su's mother] Oh!
I suppose we're being a bit loud.

124
00:09:30,570 --> 00:09:32,196
-Sorry about the noise.
-Oh.

125
00:09:33,698 --> 00:09:35,324
-Sorry.
-[daughter] You okay?

126
00:09:36,826 --> 00:09:37,660
For you.

127
00:09:37,743 --> 00:09:39,662
[daughter] Oh, you didn't have to.

128
00:09:41,956 --> 00:09:43,207
I wanted to thank you.

129
00:09:43,833 --> 00:09:46,294
I was feeling really lost earlier,

130
00:09:46,377 --> 00:09:48,004
not having a place to stay.

131
00:09:48,087 --> 00:09:49,130
[chuckles]

132
00:09:50,089 --> 00:09:52,216
This looks amazing. Thank you so much.

133
00:09:52,300 --> 00:09:55,177
[Ji-su] We brought cheesecake for dessert.
Would you like some?

134
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:56,554
I'll get it.

135
00:09:57,096 --> 00:09:59,181
We need new glasses anyway.

136
00:10:00,850 --> 00:10:01,934
Hey, sir.

137
00:10:04,979 --> 00:10:06,772
I'd love to listen to music.

138
00:10:07,273 --> 00:10:08,774
Could I use the record player?

139
00:10:11,694 --> 00:10:13,529

[water stops]

182
00:14:55,477 --> 00:14:57,187
Did you stay here last year?

183
00:14:58,230 --> 00:14:59,273
With your son.

184
00:15:01,984 --> 00:15:02,860
No.

185
00:15:04,820 --> 00:15:06,822
[mysterious music playing]

186
00:15:08,908 --> 00:15:10,034
I remember you.

187
00:15:11,702 --> 00:15:13,454
You said you were afraid of water.

188
00:15:22,046 --> 00:15:23,547
I think you're confused.

189
00:15:23,631 --> 00:15:24,590
That wasn't me.

190
00:16:36,370 --> 00:16:37,538
[man 1] Check, please.

191
00:16:38,288 --> 00:16:39,123
Yeah!

192
00:16:40,958 --> 00:16:42,876
Well, that was delicious.

193
00:16:45,796 --> 00:16:46,922
-Here you go.
-Thanks.

194
00:16:48,257 --> 00:16:50,050
-Great, right?
-[man 2] Excuse me.

195
00:16:50,551 --> 00:16:52,553
-What's up with the bill?
-Huh?

196
00:16:52,636 --> 00:16:54,888
The bill's wrong. We only had two of each.

197
00:16:55,848 --> 00:16:57,558
Ah. Mm…

198
00:16:57,641 --> 00:17:00,519
-Give me your card so I can…
-Eun-gyeong. What is it, hon?

199
00:17:00,602 --> 00:17:02,646
Oh, I think I accidentally…

200
00:17:03,772 --> 00:17:04,732
[sniffs]

201
00:17:07,401 --> 00:17:10,237
-[owner] I'm so sorry. I'll fix it. Here.
-[man 2] Jeez, okay.

202
00:17:10,946 --> 00:17:11,947
[owner] There.

203
00:17:12,031 --> 00:17:14,575
Did you really think I didn't know
you were sneaking drinks?

204
00:17:15,117 --> 00:17:17,453
Do you seriously take me for a fool?

205
00:17:18,954 --> 00:17:20,205
I'm really sorry.

206
00:17:20,289 --> 00:17:23,042
[owner] I haven't said anything
because of your husband.

207
00:17:23,625 --> 00:17:26,795
He helped me by sending
your guests to my restaurant.

208
00:17:27,421 --> 00:17:29,214
I feel for him. I do.

209
00:17:30,132 --> 00:17:32,760
Your husband's the only reason
I haven't fired you.

210
00:17:34,344 --> 00:17:35,220
Gosh.

211
00:17:35,804 --> 00:17:38,599
No more chances.
I don't wanna do this again.

212
00:17:40,017 --> 00:17:42,686
I swear, you're being a drama queen.

213
00:17:42,770 --> 00:17:44,021
Hmm? Seriously.

214
00:17:44,521 --> 00:17:46,482
[laughs]

215
00:17:52,696 --> 00:17:53,530
What's funny?

216
00:17:53,614 --> 00:17:55,908
Why are you pretending like you care?

217
00:17:55,991 --> 00:17:56,992
[owner] I'm sorry?

218
00:17:59,078 --> 00:18:02,206
Why are you acting
like you're doing this for my own good?

219
00:18:02,790 --> 00:18:05,667
-Eun-gyeong--
-You have no idea what I'm going through.

220
00:18:06,585 --> 00:18:07,836
I'm a drama queen,

221
00:18:08,712 --> 00:18:10,089
and he's the good guy?

222
00:18:11,381 --> 00:18:12,216
Why?

223
00:18:13,509 --> 00:18:15,427
Why do you feel sorry for my husband?

224
00:18:15,511 --> 00:18:17,137
Do you… have a crush on him?

225
00:18:17,221 --> 00:18:18,722
-Is that it?
-Are you crazy?

226
00:18:18,806 --> 00:18:20,849
You were seeing
that bar owner, too, weren't you?

227
00:18:20,933 --> 00:18:24,144
Did you really think that I didn't know
about you having your affair?

228
00:18:24,228 --> 00:18:26,772
-Shut it!
-You didn't hire me 'cause you care.

229
00:18:27,272 --> 00:18:30,567
I did the work for you,
and you paid me what I earned.

230
00:18:30,651 --> 00:18:33,529
Yes, I work in your restaurant
and get paid by you,

231
00:18:33,612 --> 00:18:35,531
but you cannot speak to me like that.

232
00:18:35,614 --> 00:18:37,783
-[woman] I think you're drunk, sweetie--
-I'm not drunk!

233

[pants]

234
00:18:40,953 --> 00:18:43,330
Fire me if that's what you want! Huh?

235
00:18:44,206 --> 00:18:48,168
You won't because you like seeing that
your life is so much better than mine.

236
00:18:48,669 --> 00:18:51,588
Do you get off
on having someone that's so beneath you?

237
00:18:52,631 --> 00:18:55,884
Why? You act like it's your right
to see me unhappy!

238
00:18:55,968 --> 00:18:58,137
Why? [sobs]

239
00:19:11,650 --> 00:19:13,068
Hi. Right.

240
00:19:15,988 --> 00:19:17,114
Hello?

241
00:19:20,659 --> 00:19:21,952
[liquid pouring]

242
00:19:22,035 --> 00:19:23,287
[sighs]

243
00:19:27,583 --> 00:19:28,750
-Oh, thanks.
-Here.

244
00:19:30,043 --> 00:19:33,338
There. They want to build state-of-the-art

245
00:19:33,922 --> 00:19:35,174
low-rise apartments.

246
00:19:35,841 --> 00:19:37,926
[pensive music playing]

247
00:19:38,010 --> 00:19:40,345
They're debating between two properties.

248
00:19:40,429 --> 00:19:41,722
And honestly,

249
00:19:42,389 --> 00:19:45,601
even if you have to knock the price down,
I really think you should take it.

250
00:19:45,684 --> 00:19:46,894
Knock it down by how much?

251
00:19:46,977 --> 00:19:49,104
We'll, uh, we'll take anything.

252
00:19:49,938 --> 00:19:51,190
It's already been a year.

253
00:19:51,273 --> 00:19:54,860
We're okay taking it down,
so please push it as much as you can.

254
00:19:55,485 --> 00:19:56,403
Good!

255
00:19:57,571 --> 00:19:59,114
Let's make it happen, then.

256
00:19:59,740 --> 00:20:01,575
[laughing]

257
00:20:01,658 --> 00:20:03,660
[pensive music continues]

258
00:20:14,922 --> 00:20:15,797
Honey.

259
00:20:16,840 --> 00:20:20,552
Listen. Let's… not get ahead of ourselves.

260
00:20:21,553 --> 00:20:22,846
It'll work out.

261
00:20:27,643 --> 00:20:29,144
Can you drop me at the store?

262
00:20:32,147 --> 00:20:33,607
[Eun-gyeong] Here you go.

263
00:20:36,860 --> 00:20:37,778
[Eun-gyeong sighs]

264
00:20:40,989 --> 00:20:43,575
Come on. Why are you just watching?

265
00:20:44,326 --> 00:20:45,202
Let's eat.

266
00:20:50,832 --> 00:20:52,125
[music fades]

[Sang-jun sighs]

268
00:20:56,171 --> 00:20:57,422
It's been so long

269
00:20:58,048 --> 00:21:00,926
since our family's
had a proper meal like this, hasn't it?

270
00:21:01,969 --> 00:21:05,931
We didn't even celebrate Gi-ho
scoring top of his class on his midterms.

271
00:21:07,391 --> 00:21:08,225
Here.

272
00:21:10,102 --> 00:21:12,312
Eat up, sweetie. [chuckles]

273
00:21:15,524 --> 00:21:19,236
Whether or not… this sale goes through…

274
00:21:21,530 --> 00:21:23,448
I wanna work on getting better.

278
00:21:35,752 --> 00:21:36,712
[Eun-gyeong] Hello?

279
00:21:37,671 --> 00:21:38,839
Hi, Mi-gyeong.

280
00:21:40,090 --> 00:21:41,466
[laughs] Oh, that?

281
00:21:42,718 --> 00:21:43,593
Yeah.

282
00:21:43,677 --> 00:21:45,554
[suspenseful music playing]

283
00:21:45,637 --> 00:21:47,889
[Eun-gyeong] No.
You don't need to come visit.

284
00:21:49,349 --> 00:21:50,809
Oh, no, it's okay.

285
00:21:54,396 --> 00:21:56,315
Seriously, I'm fine.

286
00:21:57,774 --> 00:22:00,068
Gosh. Goodbye. I'm hanging up now.

287
00:22:00,819 --> 00:22:03,155
Mi-gyeong, stop being so nosey.

288
00:22:03,780 --> 00:22:04,823
Yeah.

289
00:22:05,574 --> 00:22:07,868
Yes, I'm sure things
are going to get better.

290
00:22:08,452 --> 00:22:09,828
Don't worry.

291
00:22:09,911 --> 00:22:11,663
Okay, talk to you later.

292
00:22:36,355 --> 00:22:37,731
[bottles clinking]

293
00:22:38,482 --> 00:22:39,816

298
00:23:16,686 --> 00:23:19,439
-[Jong-du] She's thrown away her soul.
-[Sang-jun] What do you mean?

299
00:23:20,690 --> 00:23:22,526
She's throwing away her vice.

300
00:23:22,609 --> 00:23:24,986
[water burbling]

301
00:23:25,070 --> 00:23:27,280
[Sang-jun chuckles]

[Sang-jun sighs]

304
00:23:41,294 --> 00:23:43,046
Hey, have I ever told you about me?

305
00:23:44,256 --> 00:23:45,382
You have not.

306
00:23:45,882 --> 00:23:48,260
[tuts] It's pathetic, that's why.

307
00:23:48,343 --> 00:23:50,095
-[sighs]
-[Jong-du chuckles]

308
00:23:50,178 --> 00:23:51,012
Hey.

309
00:23:52,264 --> 00:23:54,516
I'm a washed-up old gangster

310
00:23:54,599 --> 00:23:56,685
and a troublemaker without a father

311
00:23:58,103 --> 00:23:59,938
who lives off what his mother makes.

312
00:24:00,021 --> 00:24:02,149
So who's more pathetic, huh?

313
00:24:02,232 --> 00:24:03,442
[both laugh]

314
00:24:03,525 --> 00:24:05,026
You win. [laughs]

315
00:24:08,071 --> 00:24:08,989
[sighs]

316
00:24:14,494 --> 00:24:15,370
[sighs]

317
00:24:15,871 --> 00:24:16,997
I've never been lucky.

318
00:24:18,874 --> 00:24:21,001
My parents died when I was 17.

319
00:24:21,084 --> 00:24:25,547
I realized that my… gambling uncle
ran away with the inheritance.

320
00:24:26,256 --> 00:24:27,090
[scoffs]

321
00:24:27,883 --> 00:24:31,178
I became homeless
with no relatives to help me.

322
00:24:32,596 --> 00:24:36,099
I crashed with some of the other guys
at any construction site I could.

323
00:24:37,434 --> 00:24:40,687
The laborers who went around
taking big construction work.

324
00:24:40,770 --> 00:24:41,605
Yeah.

325
00:24:43,064 --> 00:24:44,232
So then I…

326
00:24:45,192 --> 00:24:46,109
[sighs]

327
00:24:46,860 --> 00:24:50,322
…got tired of drifting around,
so I got a job at a factory.

328
00:24:50,405 --> 00:24:52,324
[scoffs] And that boss ran away.

329
00:24:52,407 --> 00:24:54,910
[scoffs] Shit, man. Life really got you.

330
00:24:54,993 --> 00:24:56,703
[Sang-jun] I know, right? [laughs]

331
00:24:56,786 --> 00:25:00,081
And back then,
I really knew people everywhere.

332
00:25:01,708 --> 00:25:04,878
I traveled so much, cleaning up his mess.

333
00:25:06,671 --> 00:25:08,006
Head office was impressed.

334
00:25:08,089 --> 00:25:09,549
So, in '85,

335
00:25:09,633 --> 00:25:12,427
they put me in charge of the factory,
even though I was young.

336
00:25:12,511 --> 00:25:13,887
Good for you.

337
00:25:13,970 --> 00:25:15,138
[Sang-jun laughs]

338
00:25:15,222 --> 00:25:17,766
Guess who
their office assistant was back then.

339
00:25:17,849 --> 00:25:19,184
It was my wife.

340
00:25:19,267 --> 00:25:20,185
[Jong-du] Ah.

341
00:25:20,810 --> 00:25:23,730
The minute I saw her, love at first sight.

342
00:25:24,231 --> 00:25:25,565
But she wasn't interested.

343
00:25:25,649 --> 00:25:27,776
[both laughing]

344
00:25:28,818 --> 00:25:31,363
Of course,
'cause compared to me, your looks are…

345
00:25:32,030 --> 00:25:33,156
horse shit.

346
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:34,074
[both laughing]

347
00:25:34,157 --> 00:25:35,909
Bastard. [laughing]

348
00:25:38,411 --> 00:25:39,246
Damn.

349
00:25:41,665 --> 00:25:42,582
[sighs]

350
00:25:43,166 --> 00:25:44,584
The IMF crisis.

351
00:25:44,668 --> 00:25:49,047
I was fortunate enough
to sell the factory, and I ended up here.

352
00:25:50,423 --> 00:25:53,552
Now that I think about it,
I've been through a lot of shit.

353
00:25:54,469 --> 00:25:55,845
And I've handled it all.

354
00:26:01,601 --> 00:26:02,644
That's my life.

355
00:26:04,187 --> 00:26:07,983
The moment that I think
I can't possibly do any more,

356
00:26:08,066 --> 00:26:09,484
a solution pops up.

357
00:26:12,404 --> 00:26:13,488
[sighs]

358
00:26:14,614 --> 00:26:16,825
I hope we can actually sell

359

Want a drink?

363
00:26:32,966 --> 00:26:35,218
-Nah, I gotta go to work.
-Now?

364
00:26:36,261 --> 00:26:39,014
Yeah, they're short a person tonight,
so I said I would.

365
00:26:41,808 --> 00:26:42,642
See ya.

366

[siren wailing]

415
00:31:12,787 --> 00:31:16,082
[officer] Your son's the one who brought
all the alcohol, cigarettes, and drugs.

416
00:31:16,165 --> 00:31:17,125
What?

417
00:31:17,208 --> 00:31:18,334
[pills rattle]

418
00:31:18,418 --> 00:31:20,169
[officer] The sleeping pills
are prescription.

419
00:31:20,253 --> 00:31:21,671
Do you know where he got them?

420
00:31:22,463 --> 00:31:24,090
The kids mixed 'em with alcohol.

421
00:31:24,173 --> 00:31:27,677
They made a game, putting more pills in
until one went into shock.

422
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:30,138
The other kids said
Gi-ho was the ringleader

423
00:31:30,221 --> 00:31:31,764
and made all of them do it.

424

425
00:31:32,849 --> 00:31:34,809

[man 1] How dare you drag our kids
to the police station at this hour!

-Huh?
-Ho-seob!

429
00:31:40,481 --> 00:31:42,191

-[man 1] You little brat!

432
00:31:48,740 --> 00:31:50,241
[man 2] Who the hell did this to you?

433
00:31:50,325 --> 00:31:52,785
-[man 1] Is it him? That little shit?
-[man 2] Was it this punk?

434
00:31:52,869 --> 00:31:53,786
[man 1] Why I oughta…

435
00:31:53,870 --> 00:31:55,288
-What the--
-Gi-ho!

436
00:31:55,371 --> 00:31:57,332
-[man 3] What the-- Is he?
-[Eun-gyeong] Gi-ho!

437
00:31:58,124 --> 00:32:00,126
Gi-ho! Gi-ho, you okay?

438
00:32:00,209 --> 00:32:01,044
Gi-ho! Wake up!

449
00:32:53,888 --> 00:32:56,599
-Open up! Now, Gi-ho! Let go of me!
-Stop! He just got home.

450
00:32:56,683 --> 00:32:59,185
-Don't do this to him!
-Where were you when this happened, huh?

451
00:32:59,268 --> 00:33:00,186
Move.

452
00:33:01,896 --> 00:33:04,440

[Eun-gyeong pants]

456
00:33:11,114 --> 00:33:11,948
What?

457
00:33:12,031 --> 00:33:14,158
The other kids forced him to bring it all.

458
00:33:15,159 --> 00:33:16,244
Oh, damn it.

459
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:19,122
He's not a child,
for Christ's sake, Eun-gyeong!

460
00:33:19,205 --> 00:33:22,291
They said if he didn't do it,
they'd set the motel on fire.

461
00:33:22,792 --> 00:33:25,211
They threatened
and have been insulting him.

462
00:33:25,294 --> 00:33:27,255
They've been beating him for months!

463
00:33:28,256 --> 00:33:31,134
And guess which kid
took the most sleeping pills?

464
00:33:31,217 --> 00:33:32,343

[woman 1] No, you don't understand.
We don't want that!

470
00:34:47,502 --> 00:34:50,546
[man 1] First of all, if you could
separate the bully from the victims

471
00:34:50,630 --> 00:34:51,589
as soon as possible…

472
00:34:51,672 --> 00:34:53,591
[principal] I understand
where you're coming from.

473
00:34:53,674 --> 00:34:55,927
[woman 1] My son isn't one
to do this kind of thing.

474
00:34:56,010 --> 00:34:58,137
-He's just a kid! A middle schooler!
-[woman 2] Mr. Koo.

475
00:34:58,221 --> 00:34:59,972
-He'd never.
-Huh?

476
00:35:00,056 --> 00:35:01,557
-Is that Gi-ho's dad?
-What the hell?

477
00:35:01,641 --> 00:35:04,268
-[man 3] Are you Gi-ho's dad?
-[principal] Please calm down. Come in.

478
00:35:04,352 --> 00:35:06,854
[man 1] How do you expect us
to calm down right now?

479
00:35:06,938 --> 00:35:10,066
Think about the state our kids are in,
thanks to his son.

480
00:35:10,149 --> 00:35:13,903
Principal, Byeong-u had to go
to the emergency room a few days ago.

481
00:35:13,986 --> 00:35:17,698
How do you expect us to send our kids
to a school where this happens?

482
00:35:17,782 --> 00:35:19,992
What kind of school are you running?
You need to decide--

483
00:35:20,076 --> 00:35:21,119
[woman 1] Enough!

484
00:35:21,202 --> 00:35:23,871
-Hey, what do you think you're doing?
-Stop!

485
00:35:23,955 --> 00:35:25,248
-Mr. Koo!
-Let go!

486
00:35:25,331 --> 00:35:26,666
Stop this right now!

487
00:35:26,749 --> 00:35:29,544
Please, this is no way to behave
in a school property.

488
00:35:29,627 --> 00:35:30,503
Please, sir.

489
00:35:30,586 --> 00:35:32,380
-Get over here, you little…
-Get off him!

490
00:35:32,463 --> 00:35:35,466
[Gi-ho] The sale of the motel,
unfortunately, fell through.

491
00:35:36,050 --> 00:35:36,968
[man 3] Please!

492
00:35:37,051 --> 00:35:39,095
[Gi-ho] The developer
who was interested in buying it

493
00:35:39,178 --> 00:35:42,181
turned out to be close friends
with that student's family.

494
00:35:42,265 --> 00:35:44,392
[police chief] Oh, you didn't need
to bring anything.

495
00:35:44,475 --> 00:35:46,102
[laughs]

496
00:35:46,185 --> 00:35:49,564
I heard what happened.
There's no need to worry, okay?

497
00:35:50,189 --> 00:35:52,150
Sorry to ask you a favor.

498
00:35:53,192 --> 00:35:55,111
No problem, Gyeong-ok.

499
00:35:55,194 --> 00:35:58,156
I'm always happy to help
an old classmate of mine.

500
00:35:58,239 --> 00:36:00,408
I don't want any special treatment.

501
00:36:03,452 --> 00:36:06,205
Can you make sure it's conducted fairly?

502
00:36:06,289 --> 00:36:08,457
Yes, yes. Drink up.

503
00:36:09,333 --> 00:36:10,501
-Thank you.
-Right.

504
00:36:12,211 --> 00:36:14,463
-[officer] Don't worry. Get home safe.
-[Gyeong-ok] Thanks.

505
00:36:26,601 --> 00:36:27,435
Sang-jun.

506
00:36:32,607 --> 00:36:33,649
I'm sorry, ma'am.

507
00:36:35,902 --> 00:36:36,819
All will work out.

508
00:36:37,987 --> 00:36:40,156
This too shall pass. It already is.

509
00:36:41,407 --> 00:36:42,325
Hmm.

510
00:36:43,242 --> 00:36:44,452
Come on, let's go.

511
00:36:56,631 --> 00:36:57,840
Oh, you're awake.

512
00:36:58,758 --> 00:36:59,800
[Sang-jun groans]

513
00:37:05,806 --> 00:37:07,475
Just let me sleep.

514
00:37:08,809 --> 00:37:11,145
I wanna catch up on
all the sleep I've missed.

515
00:37:11,646 --> 00:37:14,649
Yeah, sleep. Sure, sure, sure, sure.

516
00:37:14,732 --> 00:37:15,733
Just ignore me.

517
00:37:18,486 --> 00:37:20,529
Sorry, sorry. Sleep, sleep. Yeah.

518
00:37:25,159 --> 00:37:26,786
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

519
00:37:26,869 --> 00:37:28,454
I need to recycle those.

520
00:37:28,955 --> 00:37:30,081
Okay. All right.

521
00:37:35,294 --> 00:37:37,004
Go to sleep. I'm done cleaning up.

522
00:37:37,088 --> 00:37:38,923
[garbage clatters loudly]

523
00:37:40,132 --> 00:37:42,802
Go to sleep! Don't get up. Sleep.

524
00:37:45,846 --> 00:37:47,390
Can't sleep, huh?

525
00:37:47,473 --> 00:37:48,766
-[Sang-jun] Hey.
-What?

526
00:37:54,230 --> 00:37:55,273
Okay, I'll leave.

527
00:38:04,949 --> 00:38:06,659
[intriguing music playing]

528
00:38:18,921 --> 00:38:20,965
Oh, uh, I just thought

529
00:38:21,048 --> 00:38:23,467
it would help me stretch, you know?

REPORTER YEOM DONG-CHAN

536
00:39:21,442 --> 00:39:24,028
[man 1] I think the Ji Hyang-cheol motel
is around here.

537
00:39:24,111 --> 00:39:25,654
[man 2] Ooh, Ji Hyang-cheol!

538
00:39:26,155 --> 00:39:26,989
[man 1] Wanna go?

539
00:39:27,073 --> 00:39:28,949
[man 2] Why? Isn't that kinda creepy?

540
00:39:30,201 --> 00:39:32,453
[man 1] Some people go there
to take pictures.

541
00:39:33,079 --> 00:39:34,205
It's a tourist spot.

542
00:39:36,999 --> 00:39:38,250
-Let's go.
-Okay.

543
00:39:49,053 --> 00:39:50,304
We're ready.

544
00:39:50,388 --> 00:39:51,806
[Jong-du] No, you're not.

545
00:39:51,889 --> 00:39:53,099
What?

546
00:39:54,433 --> 00:39:55,935
I'm not serving you.

547
00:39:56,435 --> 00:39:57,269
[man 1] Why not?

548
00:39:58,437 --> 00:39:59,855
[man 2] Let's just go.

549
00:39:59,939 --> 00:40:00,856
Let go of me.

550
00:40:00,940 --> 00:40:01,857
Hey, dude.

551
00:40:05,611 --> 00:40:06,862
Why won't you serve us?

552
00:40:08,155 --> 00:40:10,408
[Jong-du] You can go
look at the sign out front.

553
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:12,201
"You"?

554
00:40:14,537 --> 00:40:15,746
Yeah, you.

555
00:40:15,830 --> 00:40:18,207
-[scoffs]
-[Jong-du] I said go look at the sign.

556
00:40:18,290 --> 00:40:20,751
Jong-du's Supermarket is on it.

557
00:40:20,835 --> 00:40:21,710
Yeah?

558
00:40:22,628 --> 00:40:23,838
Well, I'm Jong-du.

559
00:40:23,921 --> 00:40:26,424
Everything in this store is mine.

560
00:40:26,507 --> 00:40:29,635
So whether or not I serve you
is completely my decision.

561
00:40:29,718 --> 00:40:31,929
Wow. You're really funny.

562
00:40:32,012 --> 00:40:32,930
[chuckles]

563
00:40:33,472 --> 00:40:36,016
You think I'm funny?
Then go ahead and laugh.

564
00:40:36,100 --> 00:40:38,477
You fucking bastard.
All right, you and me.

565
00:40:39,145 --> 00:40:40,312
Come on!

566
00:40:40,396 --> 00:40:43,566
-Come and fight, you two-bit thug.
-Fine, I'm going, you fucker.

567
00:40:43,649 --> 00:40:46,735
-You goddamned crazy son of a bitch.
-The fuck are you looking at?

568

-[man 1] Come the fuck out, asshole!
-Let's go.

569
00:40:49,238 --> 00:40:50,948
-Fuck you, bastard!
-[Jong-du] Is that right?

570
00:40:51,031 --> 00:40:53,033
-You're a crazy bastard!
-Stop it, guys!

571
00:40:53,117 --> 00:40:54,368
[Jong-du] I can take you!

572
00:40:54,452 --> 00:40:56,245
Well, today's your lucky day!

573
00:40:56,328 --> 00:40:59,331
-Officer, hurry up and arrest this thug!
-[young Bo-min] What's going on?

574
00:40:59,415 --> 00:41:01,750
This fucker moseyed into my store,
talking a lot of smack.

575
00:41:01,834 --> 00:41:04,003
You picked a fight with me,
you fucking lunatic!

576
00:41:04,086 --> 00:41:07,798
-Calm down, calm down!
-Well, you bastards were talking shit!

577
00:41:07,882 --> 00:41:09,049
[man 2] What did we say?

578
00:41:09,592 --> 00:41:11,760
You wanna take pictures at the motel?

579
00:41:11,844 --> 00:41:14,263
It's now a tourist spot?
The fuck are you talking about?

580
00:41:14,346 --> 00:41:17,558
Stop fucking swearing at us, man!
I will fuck your shit up!

581
00:41:17,641 --> 00:41:19,143
[Jong-du] Fucking sad excuse for shit!

-I am sorry to interrupt!

Yeom Dong-chan, the Joongmin Daily.

584
00:41:31,030 --> 00:41:32,865
I'm here to write a story

585
00:41:32,948 --> 00:41:35,409
about the anniversary
of the Ji Hyang-cheol case.

586
00:41:35,993 --> 00:41:36,994
You two were saying

587
00:41:37,077 --> 00:41:39,872
you wanted to go over to the motel
to take a photo

588
00:41:39,955 --> 00:41:42,249
since someone was brutally murdered there?

589
00:41:42,917 --> 00:41:46,378
I'd like to interview you to see why
you'd wanna do something like that.

590
00:41:46,462 --> 00:41:47,588
What a load of shit.

591
00:41:48,172 --> 00:41:50,674
What kind of insane town have we come to?

592
00:41:50,758 --> 00:41:52,510
-[man 2] Hey, let's just go.
-What a shit day!

593
00:41:52,593 --> 00:41:54,970
-[Jong-du] And don't come back, assholes!
-We won't, asshole!

594
00:41:55,054 --> 00:41:58,766
-[Jong-du] Get the fuck out of here!
-[man 1] Those fucking bastards! Fuck!

595
00:41:59,266 --> 00:42:01,227
-You're a reporter, you said?
-Huh?

596
00:42:01,310 --> 00:42:02,269
-Huh?
-Huh?

597
00:42:02,353 --> 00:42:03,896
-Anniversary?
-[car doors close]

598
00:42:03,979 --> 00:42:05,814
-One-year anniversary?
-[engine starting]

599
00:42:05,898 --> 00:42:07,650
You think it's a birthday party
or something?

600
00:42:07,733 --> 00:42:09,193
I'm only here for cigarettes.

601
00:42:13,906 --> 00:42:15,658
Oh shit, man.

602
00:42:17,243 --> 00:42:19,745
What happened back there
is what I should write about?

603
00:42:21,580 --> 00:42:24,250
I only stepped in like that
'cause they were annoying.

604
00:42:26,877 --> 00:42:29,046
Writers like you are the worst,
aren't you?

605
00:42:29,672 --> 00:42:32,299
You shared pictures of the motel incident

606
00:42:33,133 --> 00:42:35,427
and post them for your work to make money.

607
00:42:35,511 --> 00:42:36,804
Wait, that's not…

608
00:42:46,981 --> 00:42:48,148
[Dong-chan sighs]

609
00:42:50,317 --> 00:42:53,737
Do you really… think people would be
interested in a story like that?

610
00:42:56,699 --> 00:42:57,575
You know,

611
00:42:58,284 --> 00:43:01,036
an article mentioned
that Ji Hyang-cheol smoked these,

612
00:43:01,120 --> 00:43:02,288
and the brand sold out.

613
00:43:04,748 --> 00:43:06,333
Only because he smoked them.

614
00:43:09,920 --> 00:43:11,714
I smoked these way before that.

615
00:43:13,299 --> 00:43:14,133
Anyway,

616
00:43:15,551 --> 00:43:18,304
people don't always respond to
or pay attention to

617
00:43:18,387 --> 00:43:20,389
the things that you think are important.

618
00:43:22,516 --> 00:43:23,976
So that's part of my job too.

619
00:43:24,560 --> 00:43:26,895
I have to keep hunting down
the next big story.

620
00:43:32,318 --> 00:43:36,572
I'd… I'd still like
to interview someone about it all.

621
00:43:37,573 --> 00:43:39,199
Do you know the motel owner?

622
00:43:40,618 --> 00:43:41,452
[Jong-du] I do.

623
00:43:53,213 --> 00:43:55,257
Yeom Dong-chan. The Joongmin Daily.

624
00:44:01,764 --> 00:44:03,390
He's good. Trust me.

625
00:44:05,726 --> 00:44:06,560
You can go.

626
00:44:08,103 --> 00:44:09,355
[Jong-du] Sheesh.

627
00:44:11,190 --> 00:44:12,107
[Jong-du sighs]

628
00:44:12,900 --> 00:44:14,026
Hey, come on.

629
00:44:16,445 --> 00:44:17,821
[Dong-chan] Everyone thinks

630
00:44:18,405 --> 00:44:20,449
that the dead are the only victims, right?

631
00:44:20,532 --> 00:44:22,409
But as soon as people start to forget,

632
00:44:22,493 --> 00:44:25,162
he gets sentenced to death
and is right back in the news.

633
00:44:25,245 --> 00:44:26,664
It's already been a year.

634
00:44:26,747 --> 00:44:29,041
Soon, it'll be two, then it'll be three.

635
00:44:30,042 --> 00:44:31,919
It'll continue to be rough for you.

636
00:44:32,419 --> 00:44:34,380
He won't actually be executed,

637
00:44:34,463 --> 00:44:37,091
and he won't keep his mouth shut
about anything he's done.

638
00:44:38,467 --> 00:44:41,303
He sends tons of letters
to reporters and police

639
00:44:41,387 --> 00:44:43,514
and gives interviews nonstop.

640
00:44:43,597 --> 00:44:46,016
He sees his murders as accomplishments.

641
00:44:46,100 --> 00:44:48,352
[pensive music playing]

642
00:44:48,435 --> 00:44:50,979
He'll brag about them
for the rest of his life.

643
00:44:52,940 --> 00:44:55,442
And your motel will be mentioned
in all of this.

644
00:44:56,318 --> 00:44:58,529
No one knows how much it's damaged you.

645
00:45:02,700 --> 00:45:04,827
Yes, I did come here to write about you.

646
00:45:05,953 --> 00:45:08,956
And the article about the murder?
Yeah, that was me.

647
00:45:10,249 --> 00:45:12,459
But now I think I know what I left out.

648
00:45:13,669 --> 00:45:15,671
It's not about a hit crime story

649
00:45:16,338 --> 00:45:18,257
or the man who committed the murders.

650
00:45:19,758 --> 00:45:20,801
It's really about you.

651
00:45:23,262 --> 00:45:24,972
Don't you wanna tell your story?

652
00:45:33,063 --> 00:45:34,815
[Jong-du sighs] Sang-jun.

653
00:45:37,192 --> 00:45:38,360
The interview.

654
00:45:39,737 --> 00:45:41,029
I think you should do it.

655
00:45:42,156 --> 00:45:43,532
If you do,

656
00:45:44,450 --> 00:45:48,036
then people might leave you alone finally.

Originally, I didn't plan to.

692

00:49:48,068 --> 00:49:50,445
[tuts] …and you pretended
I was a stranger.

As though

697
00:49:55,409 --> 00:49:57,369
you thought of nothing else
