Hey, you're back.

178

The desk was unattended.

179
00:10:23,664 --> 00:10:26,500
Oh, there was too much garbage
out the front. I took care of it.

180
00:10:27,835 --> 00:10:29,003
-Here.
-Hmm.

181
00:10:29,879 --> 00:10:30,880
When'd you get here?

182

-Hey! Did you enjoy sightseeing?

183
00:10:35,885 --> 00:10:38,638
-Ah, yes. Thank you very much.
-Give me your bags. Oh, and the keys too.

184
00:10:38,721 --> 00:10:39,555
-Great.
-Thank you.

185
00:10:39,639 --> 00:10:41,766
-[guest 2] Thank you.
-Did you try that restaurant?

186
00:10:41,849 --> 00:10:43,809
Oh yeah! The food there was great.

187
00:10:43,893 --> 00:10:45,311
-It really was. Yeah.
-I know, right?

188
00:10:45,394 --> 00:10:48,189
Everyone goes to the one next to it,
but it's not the real deal. [laughs]

189
00:10:48,272 --> 00:10:50,399
[guest 2] No wonder the food was good.

190
00:10:50,483 --> 00:10:51,317
Can I call you a car?

191
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:52,902

-Oh! That sounds great.

192
00:10:52,985 --> 00:10:54,111
-Thank you.
-[Sang-jun] One moment.

193
00:10:54,195 --> 00:10:55,154
Was it relaxing?

194
00:10:55,237 --> 00:10:57,657
-[guest 1] Absolutely.
-[guest 3] Our suite was nice and roomy.

195

Wait! One moment! One moment!

200
00:11:13,172 --> 00:11:15,091
Here. Some anniversary towels.

201
00:11:15,174 --> 00:11:16,926
-Take one.
-[guest 1] Oh wow!

202
00:11:17,009 --> 00:11:18,511
-One for you too.

[man 1] What kind of place was it?

212
00:11:50,334 --> 00:11:53,045
[man 7] A run-of-the-mill motel
in a country town.

213
00:11:56,799 --> 00:11:57,883
Business was good.

214
00:11:59,135 --> 00:12:01,053
There was a lake and a mountain nearby.

215
00:12:03,305 --> 00:12:05,015
There were a lot of young tourists

216
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:07,685
and lots of big groups too.

217
00:12:12,064 --> 00:12:14,692
Clean, good customer service.

218
00:12:16,235 --> 00:12:17,903
Just your average motel.

Where are you headed?

224
00:13:28,641 --> 00:13:30,351
There isn't anything up ahead.

225
00:13:31,644 --> 00:13:33,771
I think you took a wrong turn somewhere.

226
00:13:33,854 --> 00:13:36,482
This road gets narrow up ahead.
I'll turn it around for you.

227
00:13:36,565 --> 00:13:39,235
[sighs] Okay. Thank you so much.

228
00:13:39,318 --> 00:13:40,277
All good.

229

[man 2] Oh!

233
00:14:13,769 --> 00:14:15,855
I should really bring this to you myself.

234
00:14:17,773 --> 00:14:18,983
Oh, is this Yong-chae's?

235
00:14:19,066 --> 00:14:21,569
Here. Let's grab it too.
I'll get it to him.

236
00:14:21,652 --> 00:14:22,736
Thanks so much.

237

[Yong-chae] Yeong-ha!

245
00:15:02,568 --> 00:15:06,155
This place is even cleaner
and more spacious than my property.

246
00:15:06,238 --> 00:15:09,617
It has a completely different vibe
from the cookie-cutter rentals in town.

247
00:15:09,700 --> 00:15:12,536
Those places might look nice
on the outside,

248
00:15:12,620 --> 00:15:14,914
but they're built
with cheap materials. [chuckles]

249
00:15:15,831 --> 00:15:19,293
Th… this guy, uh,
only accepts a select few.

250

Si-hyeon, hey!

253
00:15:26,258 --> 00:15:27,551
You better get down.

254
00:15:32,389 --> 00:15:36,185
[Yong-chae] Ah, well then,
there… there's a pool here too. Eh…

255
00:15:36,268 --> 00:15:37,269
Oh.

256
00:15:38,270 --> 00:15:39,355
I, uh…

257
00:15:40,522 --> 00:15:41,899
I'm afraid of water.

258
00:15:42,524 --> 00:15:43,984
[Yong-chae] Oh. [chuckles]

259
00:15:44,818 --> 00:15:46,403
Hey, kiddo!

Does that sound fun?

263
00:15:56,622 --> 00:16:00,209
Ooh! [laughs] You're such a smart kid!

Thank you very much.

286
00:19:08,397 --> 00:19:11,316
So, for dinner tonight,
how about some barbecue?

287
00:19:12,025 --> 00:19:14,736
The man who owns the other house felt bad
and wants to treat you both.

288
00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:15,654
No, thanks.

289

[Yeong-ha] Ah.

290
00:19:17,614 --> 00:19:19,950
Sorry. My kid wants me to make dinner,
and I got groceries.

291
00:19:20,033 --> 00:19:21,243
I see.

292
00:19:21,326 --> 00:19:22,369
Good evening, then.

[Yeong-ha and Yong-chae laugh]

350
00:23:10,931 --> 00:23:12,766
Time for dinner, Si-hyeon. Yeah?

351
00:23:12,849 --> 00:23:15,310
Go to your mom, okay? Hmm? There we are.

352
00:23:15,394 --> 00:23:17,562
[Yong-chae sighs, laughs]

353
00:23:17,646 --> 00:23:19,022
Be careful! [groans]

354
00:23:21,525 --> 00:23:24,361
[sighs] They got the weather wrong
on the broadcast.

355
00:23:24,444 --> 00:23:26,238
Why don't you shower here?

356
00:23:26,321 --> 00:23:27,364
Nah, nah.

357
00:23:28,073 --> 00:23:31,952
I'll shower at home. [grunts, laughs]

358
00:23:32,786 --> 00:23:33,870
[laughs]

359
00:23:38,041 --> 00:23:40,043
[mysterious music playing]

360
00:23:46,466 --> 00:23:47,509
[door closes]

361
00:23:53,473 --> 00:23:56,309
LAKE VIEW MOTEL

362
00:23:56,393 --> 00:23:57,519
[thunder rumbling]

363
00:24:10,115 --> 00:24:12,117
[thunder rumbling]

364
00:24:35,807 --> 00:24:37,809
[thunder rumbling]

365
00:25:30,862 --> 00:25:32,781
Oh my gosh. Jeez.

366
00:25:35,492 --> 00:25:36,409
Come on in.

367
00:25:38,954 --> 00:25:39,871
[chuckles]

368
00:25:41,373 --> 00:25:42,374
[guest wipes feet]

369
00:25:43,542 --> 00:25:44,376
[Sang-jun sighs]

370
00:25:45,919 --> 00:25:48,213
[Sang-jun] Wow!
It's really pouring out there. [laughs]

371
00:25:49,464 --> 00:25:50,674
[guest] How much for one night?

372
00:25:50,757 --> 00:25:54,052
A small is 30,000 won.
Large is 40. For one night, right?

373
00:25:54,135 --> 00:25:55,178
Yeah.

374
00:25:59,057 --> 00:26:00,141
[Sang-jun] Great.

375
00:26:08,066 --> 00:26:12,153
[chuckles] A nice big suite.
You can watch the rain and relax.

376
00:26:13,238 --> 00:26:16,324
I'd actually like a… second-floor suite.

377
00:26:24,249 --> 00:26:25,208
[Sang-jun] Come in.

378
00:26:27,002 --> 00:26:29,504
[sighs] It's a bit big
for one person, but…

379
00:26:30,630 --> 00:26:31,590
[Sang-jun chuckles]

380
00:26:42,809 --> 00:26:44,311
It's a great view of the lake.

381
00:26:48,273 --> 00:26:49,983
No, that's okay. [chuckles]

382
00:26:50,066 --> 00:26:53,236
If you like the room, stay here again.
I'll just leave the key right here.

383
00:26:54,404 --> 00:26:55,405
Well, enjoy.

384
00:26:56,781 --> 00:26:57,866
Uh, excuse me.

385
00:27:00,035 --> 00:27:01,786
Is there a gas station near here?

386
00:27:02,287 --> 00:27:04,789
It's a bit far,
but I'm sure they can deliver.

387
00:27:04,873 --> 00:27:07,042
-Would you like that?
-No, that's okay.

388
00:27:07,751 --> 00:27:10,253
Um, okay. Well, if you change your mind,
let me know. [chuckles]

389
00:27:10,962 --> 00:27:11,963
You're very nice.

390
00:27:13,214 --> 00:27:14,716
[chuckles] Good evening.

391
00:27:15,216 --> 00:27:17,218
[mysterious music playing]

392
00:27:21,056 --> 00:27:21,890
[chuckles]

393
00:27:33,735 --> 00:27:35,153
[thunder rumbling]

394
00:27:47,666 --> 00:27:49,501
[kettle whistling]

395
00:27:50,085 --> 00:27:52,045
[footsteps approaching]

396
00:27:54,047 --> 00:27:55,006
[door opens]

397
00:27:58,426 --> 00:27:59,386
[Yong-chae groans]

398
00:28:00,470 --> 00:28:01,805
It's been raining all day.

399
00:28:08,812 --> 00:28:09,813
How's your guest?

400
00:28:11,106 --> 00:28:13,066
[Yeong-ha] She'll call
if she needs something.

401
00:28:13,149 --> 00:28:15,276
[Yong-chae] Young people these days,

402
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:17,946
they prefer
keeping to themselves on trips.

403
00:28:18,863 --> 00:28:21,282
Those unmanned rentals
and motels are doing well.

404
00:28:26,037 --> 00:28:27,539
Oh, the beer. [grunts]

405
00:28:30,375 --> 00:28:31,668
[Yeong-ha slurping]

406
00:28:35,004 --> 00:28:36,047
Here.

407
00:28:39,342 --> 00:28:40,385
Thanks a lot.

408
00:28:40,468 --> 00:28:42,137
You don't need to thank me.

409
00:28:44,139 --> 00:28:45,140
[both slurp]

410
00:28:45,849 --> 00:28:46,850
[Yong-chae sighs]

411
00:28:49,060 --> 00:28:50,437
What does she do for work?

412
00:28:50,520 --> 00:28:51,771
[sniffles] What?

413
00:28:53,314 --> 00:28:55,066
I saw you talking to her for a bit.

414
00:28:56,985 --> 00:28:58,528
I asked her about dinner.

415
00:29:02,449 --> 00:29:03,992
I think she's in the arts.

416
00:29:04,617 --> 00:29:06,453
Visual arts or music.

417
00:29:07,328 --> 00:29:08,830
I'm good at sussing that out.

418
00:29:10,498 --> 00:29:12,333
She has a similar vibe to your wife.

419
00:29:12,417 --> 00:29:13,543
What are you saying?

420
00:29:15,044 --> 00:29:16,880
I'm not sure if she's a single mother.

421
00:29:16,963 --> 00:29:19,048
The boy said his father is away for work.

422
00:29:19,132 --> 00:29:20,967
You're being such a nosey guy.

423
00:29:21,050 --> 00:29:22,927
[laughs] Did you notice?

424
00:29:23,428 --> 00:29:25,722
One look at this place, and she loved it.

425
00:29:25,805 --> 00:29:27,640
It's a great place. Don't waste it.

426
00:29:27,724 --> 00:29:29,309
I think it's perfect.

427
00:29:30,894 --> 00:29:31,895
[Yeong-ha sniffles]

428
00:29:32,645 --> 00:29:35,106
[inhales deeply]
I can't work on it on my own.

429
00:29:36,274 --> 00:29:37,484
You think I don't?

430
00:29:37,567 --> 00:29:39,152
[laughs, sniffles]

431
00:29:42,197 --> 00:29:43,323
[Yong-chae sighs]

432
00:29:45,408 --> 00:29:47,368
Your daughter? Coming this summer?

433
00:29:48,828 --> 00:29:50,622
She said she's coming next week.

434
00:29:51,581 --> 00:29:52,957
She's a good kid.

435
00:29:53,625 --> 00:29:56,044
Look at my little stinkers! Never see me.

436
00:29:56,127 --> 00:29:57,796
[both laugh]

437
00:29:57,879 --> 00:29:59,130
[Yong-chae slurps]

438
00:29:59,631 --> 00:30:01,466
In-laws, Yeong-ha? You and me?

439
00:30:02,050 --> 00:30:03,051
[sighs]

440
00:30:03,843 --> 00:30:04,886
Really, you and me?

441
00:30:04,969 --> 00:30:06,346
[both laugh]

442
00:30:06,429 --> 00:30:08,681
-Why not? Hmm?
-Don't be silly.

443
00:30:09,349 --> 00:30:12,227
My second son Gyeong-mo is 30. In IT.

444
00:30:12,310 --> 00:30:15,897
He's not that bad-looking.
And she'd gain an excellent father-in-law.

445
00:30:15,980 --> 00:30:17,565
She's not marrying the father-in-law.

446
00:30:17,649 --> 00:30:19,484
Look at the bigger picture.

447
00:30:19,567 --> 00:30:21,486
Back in my day, I was very successful.

448
00:30:22,237 --> 00:30:25,073
My kids only stay in touch
for all the money I've saved.

449
00:30:25,156 --> 00:30:26,825
But I'd leave it all
to my daughter-in-law.

450
00:30:26,908 --> 00:30:27,909
[Yeong-ha laughs]

451
00:30:28,451 --> 00:30:29,536
Jeez. [chuckles]

452
00:30:30,328 --> 00:30:32,038
-She's still too young.
-[laughs]

453
00:30:32,539 --> 00:30:34,415
I'll see what she has to say.

454
00:30:34,958 --> 00:30:36,459
I'm sure you will.

455
00:30:37,085 --> 00:30:38,419
-Drink your beer.
-[laughs]

456
00:30:38,503 --> 00:30:40,505
[both laugh]

457
00:30:41,005 --> 00:30:43,091
[pensive music playing]

458
00:30:43,174 --> 00:30:46,594
[Yong-chae] Tomorrow, I'll clean
this place up from top to bottom for you.

459
00:30:46,678 --> 00:30:47,887
Including the pool!

460
00:30:48,513 --> 00:30:50,974
[Yong-chae and Yeong-ha laugh]

461
00:30:51,683 --> 00:30:53,518
[Yeong-ha] I wonder if the rain will stop.

462
00:30:53,601 --> 00:30:55,603
[unsettling music playing]

463
00:31:09,576 --> 00:31:10,785

[Yeong-ha sighs]

478
00:32:18,186 --> 00:32:20,146
[employee] Are these the ones
you were looking for?

479
00:32:20,897 --> 00:32:23,232
-Thanks so much.
-[employee] You'll find more in aisle 8.

480

[phone buzzing]

482
00:32:33,701 --> 00:32:34,619
Hey.

483
00:32:35,286 --> 00:32:37,538
At the supermarket. [groans]

484
00:32:38,957 --> 00:32:41,334
Next week? Of course you can.

485
00:32:41,417 --> 00:32:42,543
No one's booked then.

486
00:32:45,213 --> 00:32:47,590
Who are you bringing? A friend?

487
00:32:49,258 --> 00:32:50,176
A man?

488
00:32:50,259 --> 00:32:51,302
[sniffles]

489
00:32:51,386 --> 00:32:53,721
Mm. Yeah, okay.

-[officer 3] That's how you do it.

504
00:33:57,160 --> 00:33:58,786
You have to keep being nice to them, yeah?

505
00:33:58,870 --> 00:34:00,496
-Your cigarette, sir.
-Thank you.

-[officer 2] Sure.

508
00:34:07,920 --> 00:34:11,090
[Sang-jun groans] Nice and relaxing.

-Excuse me.
-Yeah?

510
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:15,344
Can you make me some ramyeon?

511
00:34:15,428 --> 00:34:16,846
If you pay for it, sir.

512
00:34:16,929 --> 00:34:19,515
Ah, pay for it? Of course. Here.

513
00:34:22,226 --> 00:34:25,104
Ugh, you…
I could knock you flat on your ass.
