[stirring music playing]

3
00:00:13,596 --> 00:00:15,890
[Yeong-ha] She was gonna bury something
at the property.

4
00:00:15,974 --> 00:00:17,142
[breathing heavily]

5
00:00:17,225 --> 00:00:18,268
I think she…

6
00:00:20,228 --> 00:00:21,813
I think she killed somebody.

7
00:00:49,674 --> 00:00:51,926
[Bo-min] You contacted Jeon Ui-seon
with Mr. Park's phone

8
00:00:52,010 --> 00:00:54,846
and sent her a message
to get her to come. Am I correct?

9
00:01:01,394 --> 00:01:04,105
You and the owner of the place
had some arguments, no?

10
00:01:06,524 --> 00:01:07,901
So you changed up your plans.

11
00:01:10,820 --> 00:01:14,032
Was assaulting and kidnapping his daughter
the end goal of that plan?

12
00:01:16,034 --> 00:01:17,077
[sighs]

13
00:01:31,299 --> 00:01:33,301
[handcuffs rattling]

[door closes]

15
00:01:37,097 --> 00:01:38,598
I wonder who you killed.

16
00:01:40,975 --> 00:01:42,227
I wonder where they are.

17
00:01:44,562 --> 00:01:46,231
[Seong-a] What are you even talking about?

18
00:01:46,314 --> 00:01:47,398
Shut your mouth.

19
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:52,195
I'd be out of a job
if this is all it took to put you away.

20
00:01:54,697 --> 00:01:56,324
Even though you stabbed a man…

21
00:01:58,535 --> 00:01:59,911
you were both hurt.

22
00:01:59,994 --> 00:02:01,412
You'll claim self-defense.

23
00:02:03,498 --> 00:02:04,582
You stole a cell phone

24
00:02:04,666 --> 00:02:07,293
to lure a pregnant woman into the woods
and beat her.

25
00:02:08,211 --> 00:02:09,212
She was pregnant?

26
00:02:11,923 --> 00:02:14,634
You would've enjoyed it more
if you knew about it, huh?

27
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:16,803
[Seong-a chuckles]

28
00:02:19,180 --> 00:02:21,099
It was all just a coincidence, right?

29
00:02:21,182 --> 00:02:22,684
[mysterious music playing]

30
00:02:22,767 --> 00:02:24,352
Running when you saw police?

31
00:02:24,894 --> 00:02:26,062
You were scared.

32
00:02:27,313 --> 00:02:28,606
That's what you're gonna go with?

33
00:02:28,690 --> 00:02:30,692
Why are you even holding me here?

34
00:02:31,901 --> 00:02:33,945
I'm sure if you decide to keep quiet,

35
00:02:34,737 --> 00:02:37,198
you'll get out
as soon as your attorney gets here.

36
00:02:37,699 --> 00:02:38,658
Scot-free.

37
00:02:39,868 --> 00:02:42,495
But if you did do something else
that was even worse,

38
00:02:42,996 --> 00:02:44,664
I would keep your guard up.

39
00:02:44,747 --> 00:02:47,000
[laughing]

40
00:02:49,377 --> 00:02:51,462
Otherwise, it's just boring, isn't it?

41
00:02:51,546 --> 00:02:54,382
[sighs] You're completely insane.

42
00:02:55,008 --> 00:02:56,217
Wonder who you killed.

43
00:02:57,552 --> 00:02:59,262
And where could you have put them?

44
00:03:00,513 --> 00:03:02,640
Ah! The cornfield, right?

45
00:03:04,642 --> 00:03:06,644
[unsettling music playing]

00:03:16,404 --> 00:03:17,447
[door opens]

47
00:03:18,990 --> 00:03:20,575
[lawyer] Not another word, Miss Yoo.

48
00:03:21,284 --> 00:03:22,493
Get these cuffs off her.

49
00:03:24,287 --> 00:03:28,124
Captain, I'll need a search party
at the cornfield immediately.

50
00:03:44,432 --> 00:03:46,434
[music fades]

51
00:03:48,561 --> 00:03:55,568
CHIEF'S OFFICE

52
00:04:05,620 --> 00:04:09,165
[chief] Everything's under control.
Right, good night, sir.

53
00:04:10,917 --> 00:04:11,960
[disconnect tone]

54
00:04:13,211 --> 00:04:14,921
Un-fucking-believable.

55
00:04:15,004 --> 00:04:17,382
I've heard you've pulled
shit like this before, but…

56
00:04:17,882 --> 00:04:19,259
I need a search team, sir.

57
00:04:19,342 --> 00:04:20,468
[phone buzzing]

58
00:04:24,681 --> 00:04:26,349
Are you kidding me right now?

59
00:04:26,432 --> 00:04:28,226
I think that she killed somebody.

60
00:04:30,228 --> 00:04:31,938
You're stepping way out of line.

61
00:04:32,021 --> 00:04:34,315
If you're a chicken, I'll handle it.
Don't worry.

62
00:04:34,399 --> 00:04:35,400
"Chicken"?

63
00:04:36,401 --> 00:04:39,070
You little bitch.
What makes you think you have a lead?

64
00:04:44,909 --> 00:04:45,910
[door opens]

65
00:04:54,335 --> 00:04:55,253
[door closes]

66
00:04:58,965 --> 00:05:01,801
Yoo Seong-a bought all this
at the supermarket yesterday.

67
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:05,179
Looks like she's trying
to get rid of a body to me,

68
00:05:05,263 --> 00:05:07,390
and I heard she was burying something.

69
00:05:09,892 --> 00:05:12,228
[unsettling music playing]

70
00:05:35,793 --> 00:05:36,961
Okay, then.

71
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:42,592
But that's a different case, isn't it?

72
00:05:43,468 --> 00:05:46,054
From the one
you brought her in for tonight, I mean.

73
00:05:49,265 --> 00:05:51,809
Find the body that she buried first.

74
00:05:55,063 --> 00:05:58,024
If we find nothing there,
I'll hand in my gun and badge.

75
00:06:03,738 --> 00:06:05,907
Yeah, you should
because you jumped the gun on this.

76
00:06:05,990 --> 00:06:07,492
But if we do find someone…

77
00:06:10,203 --> 00:06:11,746
and we find evidence,

78
00:06:12,497 --> 00:06:14,624
the person we had in custody
was the culprit.

79
00:06:16,501 --> 00:06:19,504
And even though I had her
dead to rights, you let her go,

80
00:06:20,421 --> 00:06:23,299
claiming that I jumped the gun
and made an illegal arrest.

81
00:06:24,175 --> 00:06:26,094
That wouldn't bode well for you, huh?

82
00:06:28,888 --> 00:06:30,556
Who'd turn in their badge then?

83
00:06:36,854 --> 00:06:38,064
[door opens]

84
00:06:40,691 --> 00:06:41,692
[man 1] She's here.

85
00:06:42,652 --> 00:06:43,569
Captain.

86
00:06:53,538 --> 00:06:54,789
[music fades]

87
00:06:55,581 --> 00:06:56,707
[grunts]

88
00:07:03,965 --> 00:07:04,924
Captain.

89
00:07:05,925 --> 00:07:08,094
I, uh, just turned it in.

90
00:07:08,177 --> 00:07:10,972
I brought in some more evidence
from the security camera.

91
00:07:11,055 --> 00:07:13,099
I put my gloves on
before I handled the clothes.

92
00:07:13,182 --> 00:07:16,561
So when I turned in the evidence,
it was still completely pristine.

93
00:07:17,979 --> 00:07:19,897
I'm sure her lawyers are thrilled now.

94
00:07:19,981 --> 00:07:23,025
-Sorry?
-Her ex-husband hit her the day before.

95
00:07:23,109 --> 00:07:24,986
She was in the emergency room for it.

96
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:28,531
I'm gonna bet
that blood is probably her own.

97
00:07:29,699 --> 00:07:32,952
Domestic abuse paired with
a history of mental illnesses…

98
00:07:33,786 --> 00:07:35,997
She's got a real solid defense now.

99
00:07:42,378 --> 00:07:44,672
-Wait, then, what… what?
-[engine starting]

100
00:07:46,090 --> 00:07:47,091
Then what should--

101
00:07:49,469 --> 00:07:52,930
[doctor] Her spleen ruptured,
so we performed emergency surgery.

102
00:07:53,014 --> 00:07:54,432
The surgery went well.

103
00:07:54,515 --> 00:07:57,101
She was unconscious
due to the drug in her system.

104
00:07:57,185 --> 00:07:59,479
If we didn't catch it,
she would have gone into shock.

105
00:07:59,562 --> 00:08:00,771
Did you say drug?

106
00:08:01,314 --> 00:08:03,816
Yes, though she vomited
while she was still conscious.

107
00:08:04,484 --> 00:08:07,570
I think she gave herself first aid
before losing consciousness.

108
00:08:07,653 --> 00:08:09,614
And because of that, the baby survived.

109
00:08:10,198 --> 00:08:11,532
I appreciate it.

110
00:08:11,616 --> 00:08:12,867
Thank you.

111
00:08:16,037 --> 00:08:17,663
[officer] What was the drug in her system?

112
00:08:17,747 --> 00:08:20,333
[doctor] It's still inconclusive,
but we're waiting on results.

113
00:08:24,962 --> 00:08:26,923
[Yeong-ha] She's asleep. Go on in.

114
00:08:27,006 --> 00:08:28,007
[Ji-su] Oh.

115
00:08:33,930 --> 00:08:34,972

Hey.

120
00:09:40,871 --> 00:09:42,832
[Gyeong-nam] I can't believe
what's happening now!

121
00:09:42,915 --> 00:09:45,585
They're letting that psycho
just walk out of here.

122
00:09:47,211 --> 00:09:49,213
[stirring music playing]

123
00:10:00,933 --> 00:10:02,476
[music fades]

124
00:10:03,561 --> 00:10:06,063
[lawyer] Director Yoo has been desperate
to get you out.

125
00:10:06,147 --> 00:10:07,732
He said, "No matter what it takes."

126
00:10:07,815 --> 00:10:08,941
And what does he want?

127
00:10:09,609 --> 00:10:10,901
A gold star?

128
00:10:10,985 --> 00:10:12,069
Where's my passport?

129
00:10:12,570 --> 00:10:15,865
I made it really clear that I'm going
straight to the airport from here.

130
00:10:15,948 --> 00:10:17,617
I was rushing over here, so I couldn't--

131
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:19,368
Rush, my fucking ass. That's bullshit.

132
00:10:19,452 --> 00:10:21,203
[lawyer] You need
to come with me to Seoul.

133
00:10:22,955 --> 00:10:25,166
Your father said
this was your last chance.

134
00:10:27,668 --> 00:10:29,629
I should probably sue that woman.

135
00:10:31,130 --> 00:10:32,882
I was in there for two hours.

136
00:10:34,675 --> 00:10:36,385
Do it and email me the details.

137
00:10:39,639 --> 00:10:41,641

00:11:25,601 --> 00:11:27,895
-Mr. Jeon.
-[Yeong-ha] You let her go?

142
00:11:27,978 --> 00:11:30,981
How do you arrest someone
and then let them go after a couple hours?

143
00:11:34,860 --> 00:11:36,654
We're gonna get her. I promise.

144
00:11:36,737 --> 00:11:38,489
She almost killed my daughter!

145
00:11:39,657 --> 00:11:41,534
She went after my family!

146
00:11:42,284 --> 00:11:44,078
How does this make any sense?

147
00:11:46,330 --> 00:11:47,998
And where is that woman now?

148
00:11:48,082 --> 00:11:50,126
Whatever she was trying
to bury at your house…

149

[car doors closing]

150
00:11:51,836 --> 00:11:53,170

[Seong-a] The exhibit's over.

154
00:12:00,678 --> 00:12:01,679
Tomorrow, I fly out.

155
00:12:04,807 --> 00:12:06,392
I can't afford to wait anymore.

156
00:12:06,475 --> 00:12:07,435
[Bo-min] Mr. Jeon.

157
00:12:08,436 --> 00:12:09,854
This is all I care about.

158
00:12:19,989 --> 00:12:21,073
[Bo-min] Let's begin.

159
00:12:22,199 --> 00:12:24,076
[Choi] We'll start at the entrance.
Single file.

160
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:25,578
-Move out.
-Yes, sir!

[Gyeong-nam] Captain!

169
00:14:19,483 --> 00:14:20,985
We'll search this side of the field.

[suspenseful music playing]

171
00:15:38,646 --> 00:15:39,688

What happened here?

280

[Gyu-sik] How you doing?

376
00:32:26,361 --> 00:32:27,320
[Bo-min] I'm bored.

377
00:32:28,404 --> 00:32:31,908
[Gyu-sik] Rest up. And when you're better,
come back to Violent Crimes.

[wistful music playing]

386
00:34:54,092 --> 00:34:55,301
[Yong-chae] What are you doing?

387
00:34:56,594 --> 00:35:00,890
Oh, uh, I was looking for a torch
'cause everything froze over.

388
00:35:00,973 --> 00:35:02,642
[Yong-chae laughing]

389
00:35:02,725 --> 00:35:03,768
Hey, Yeong-ha.

390
00:35:04,268 --> 00:35:07,772
Have you never had your pipes freeze
or your boiler burst before?

391
00:35:11,609 --> 00:35:12,819
Your name is Yeong-ha.

392
00:35:12,902 --> 00:35:15,321
How are you such an old geezer
about all this stuff?

393
00:35:16,989 --> 00:35:18,449
Take it up with my dad.

394
00:35:18,533 --> 00:35:19,992
[Yong-chae laughs]

395
00:35:20,076 --> 00:35:21,786
It's okay. I called someone.

396
00:35:21,869 --> 00:35:22,870
[Yeong-ha] Huh?

397
00:35:25,748 --> 00:35:26,916

[woman] Thanks for your help. [laughs]

403
00:35:56,863 --> 00:35:59,323
-Here's some tea.
-[Yong-chae] Oh, thanks so much.

[Yong-chae exhales]

405
00:36:05,872 --> 00:36:09,500
If you'd just bought covers,
they normally go for about 2,000 won.

406
00:36:10,001 --> 00:36:11,752
Now, it's about ten times as much.

407
00:36:11,836 --> 00:36:13,838
[all laugh]

408
00:36:15,256 --> 00:36:18,551
-Well, don't forget to buy them next year.
-[both chuckle]

409
00:36:22,013 --> 00:36:24,140
[Yong-chae] Look.
It's snowing again. Look.

[woman gasps]

411
00:36:26,976 --> 00:36:29,687
[Yong-chae] I heard you really wanted
to see the snow, Seong-ran.

412
00:36:30,313 --> 00:36:32,899
-Well, get your fill.
-Yes.

413
00:36:32,982 --> 00:36:34,775
[Yong-chae] Honestly,
I'm so sick of the snow.

414
00:36:34,859 --> 00:36:37,445
You'll understand, too,
once you've been here a while.

415

422
00:37:07,099 --> 00:37:08,351
[Yeong-ha] Think that'll do it?

423
00:37:10,436 --> 00:37:11,312
Oh!

424
00:37:12,104 --> 00:37:14,190

[Yeong-ha sighs]

441
00:39:46,217 --> 00:39:49,220
So how is it living back in the city
with Ui-seon?

442
00:39:49,887 --> 00:39:51,514
Hmm, I'm not sure I like it.

443
00:39:52,098 --> 00:39:53,849
-I'm just getting fat.
-[laughs]

444
00:39:55,226 --> 00:39:56,394
Anyway…

445
00:39:57,561 --> 00:39:59,063
Uh, there's just so much

446
00:39:59,814 --> 00:40:01,273
to fix in here.

447
00:40:01,357 --> 00:40:03,150
[Yong-chae]
You have all the time in the world.

448
00:40:03,234 --> 00:40:04,944
Take it slow. There's no rush.

449
00:40:05,653 --> 00:40:06,695
Like back then, you know?

450
00:40:06,779 --> 00:40:09,407
No way. I called a contractor.

451
00:40:10,074 --> 00:40:11,075
I'm not waiting.

452
00:40:11,158 --> 00:40:12,618
Look at this guy.

453
00:40:12,701 --> 00:40:13,828

CHIEF DETECTIVE
YOON BO-MIN

456
00:40:57,204 --> 00:40:58,164
[Bo-min] Thank you.

457
00:41:04,170 --> 00:41:06,213
My first station was right around here.

458
00:41:06,964 --> 00:41:08,632
I was feeling a bit nostalgic.

459
00:41:08,716 --> 00:41:11,552
I wanted to drive by the lake
and ended up lost.

460
00:41:13,345 --> 00:41:14,388
Right.

461
00:41:17,057 --> 00:41:18,267
Looks like you write.

462
00:41:30,529 --> 00:41:32,364
I took a photo here too, actually.

463
00:41:33,741 --> 00:41:34,783
I lost it though.

464
00:41:46,921 --> 00:41:48,047

JULY 2001, MY FIRST CASE

468
00:42:00,351 --> 00:42:01,227
Is this yours?

469
00:42:04,563 --> 00:42:05,481
Yeah.

470
00:42:10,903 --> 00:42:13,572
It wasn't too hard
to figure out how it all went down,

471
00:42:14,448 --> 00:42:15,741
the hospital visit…

472
00:42:17,952 --> 00:42:21,330
I remember Park Jong-du and his mother
from over 20 years ago.

473
00:42:24,625 --> 00:42:27,044
But not every secret has to be revealed.

474
00:42:27,670 --> 00:42:29,296
They can just stay hidden.

475
00:42:32,174 --> 00:42:33,676
[pensive music playing]

476
00:42:33,759 --> 00:42:38,138
[Bo-min] Ha Jae-sik, who shot Yoo Seong-a
at Mr. Jeon Yeong-ha's place,

477
00:42:38,222 --> 00:42:39,932
wouldn't say where he got the gun.

478
00:42:40,599 --> 00:42:43,811
Funny enough, a similar gun was used
to kill Ji Hyang-cheol,

479
00:42:43,894 --> 00:42:45,479
but that trail went cold too.

480
00:42:53,237 --> 00:42:54,613
And Yoo Seong-a's father,

481
00:42:54,697 --> 00:42:57,199
who wanted the whole thing
to go away quietly,

482
00:42:59,326 --> 00:43:03,163
even had his lawyer defend Jae-sik,
the man who killed his own daughter.

483
00:43:03,872 --> 00:43:05,916
As I'm sure you'd expect,
Director Yoo sent me.

484
00:43:11,422 --> 00:43:13,549
[Bo-min] I suppose Mr. Jeon Yeong-ha,

485
00:43:13,632 --> 00:43:16,552
who alone knows the whole truth,
is keeping it to himself

486
00:43:17,511 --> 00:43:19,054
in order to protect someone.

487
00:43:28,147 --> 00:43:30,149
Guess you haven't seen him
since then, have you?

488
00:43:38,157 --> 00:43:39,742
Why are you letting this slide?

489
00:43:44,913 --> 00:43:46,498
I don't wanna lose the killer

490
00:43:47,499 --> 00:43:48,626
and then capture the frog.

491
00:43:52,755 --> 00:43:54,340
Not my jurisdiction anyways.

492
00:43:56,383 --> 00:43:57,509
[chuckles]

493
00:43:58,510 --> 00:43:59,678
That's just like you.

494
00:44:00,596 --> 00:44:02,765
You didn't smile much back then either.

495
00:44:06,435 --> 00:44:07,519
[door opens]

496
00:44:08,354 --> 00:44:09,396

[feel-good music playing]

499
00:45:17,005 --> 00:45:19,800
[Gyeong-nam] One iced Americano,
one green grape soda, and one sandwich?

500
00:45:19,883 --> 00:45:21,719
-[man 1] Yep.
-[Gyeong-nam] Coming up.

501
00:45:21,802 --> 00:45:23,303
I'll be right there with your order.

502
00:45:24,888 --> 00:45:26,181
-[Yong-chae] Yeong-ha!
-Thank you.

503
00:45:26,265 --> 00:45:28,058
-Oh, you're here! [laughs]
-[Yeong-ha] Hey.

504
00:45:28,142 --> 00:45:29,768
Hey, two iced Americanos.

505
00:45:30,477 --> 00:45:32,187
Grape soda. Thanks.

506
00:45:32,980 --> 00:45:35,107
[woman 1] Oh, would you mind
taking a picture for us?

507
00:45:35,190 --> 00:45:36,567
[Gyeong-nam] Oh yeah, of course.

508
00:45:38,235 --> 00:45:40,654
-Wow, look at all these people.
-[Gyeong-nam] Is this good?

509
00:45:41,947 --> 00:45:44,199
[Yong-chae] It's doing much better
than the laundromat was.

510
00:45:44,283 --> 00:45:46,243
It's like this was his true calling.

511
00:45:46,326 --> 00:45:48,746
Look, he's big-time. Think he'll ditch us?

512
00:45:48,829 --> 00:45:50,372
[Gyeong-nam] I'll bring you your drinks.

513
00:45:50,456 --> 00:45:53,083
-Let's mooch just a little longer.
-[both laughing]

514
00:45:55,127 --> 00:45:57,045
-Here you go.
-Thank you, sir.

515
00:45:57,129 --> 00:45:59,715
-You two are having a good time, huh?
-[both laughing]

516
00:45:59,798 --> 00:46:01,091
-You making fun?
-Mm-mm!

517
00:46:02,050 --> 00:46:05,262
-Hey, are you free tonight?
-For the party? Of course.

518
00:46:05,345 --> 00:46:06,305
One minute.

519
00:46:09,600 --> 00:46:11,602
[feel-good music continues]

520
00:46:16,982 --> 00:46:18,400
Try this. It's pretty good.

521
00:46:20,319 --> 00:46:22,321
-On me, gentlemen.
-[Yeong-ha] Thank you.

522
00:46:23,113 --> 00:46:25,157
Wow, we're mooching already, huh?

523
00:46:25,240 --> 00:46:27,242
[both laughing]

524
00:46:35,667 --> 00:46:36,752
Uncle Yong-chae!

525
00:46:37,294 --> 00:46:39,838
[Yong-chae] Oh you're here!
Dr. Nephew-in-Law! [laughs]

526
00:46:39,922 --> 00:46:40,839
[Ji-su] Hello.

527
00:46:40,923 --> 00:46:42,174
[laughs]

528
00:46:49,681 --> 00:46:51,433
Look who's here. Who is that?

529
00:46:51,517 --> 00:46:53,936
Look. Can you say, "Hi, Grandpa"?

530
00:46:56,897 --> 00:46:58,398
-Take these first.
-Sure.

531
00:47:03,862 --> 00:47:04,988
Do you have a wine opener?

532
00:47:05,072 --> 00:47:06,490
[Ji-su] Yep, got it right here.

533
00:47:26,677 --> 00:47:27,719
[music fades]

534
00:47:29,847 --> 00:47:30,973
[phone buzzes]

535
00:47:35,269 --> 00:47:38,939
I'D LIKE TO BOOK YOUR VACATION RENTAL

536
00:47:46,363 --> 00:47:49,700
[Yeong-ha] I'm sorry,
but we're no longer in business.

537
00:47:53,078 --> 00:47:54,204
[phone buzzing]

538
00:48:03,630 --> 00:48:04,506
Hello?

539
00:48:18,020 --> 00:48:21,189
[Gi-ho] I wanted to see your place…
Mr. Jeon.

540
00:48:24,484 --> 00:48:25,485
[sighs]

541
00:48:29,281 --> 00:48:30,574
[Yeong-ha] Then, I guess
