1
00:00:11,511 --> 00:00:13,638
A deceased man in his twenties

2
00:00:13,722 --> 00:00:17,392
is said to have been writing
the autobiography of a serial killer.

3
00:00:17,475 --> 00:00:21,271
Kim, a ghostwriter who hanged himself
in a small studio apartment in Seoul,

4
00:00:21,354 --> 00:00:23,523
posted on an online forum before his death

5
00:00:23,606 --> 00:00:27,902
that he was ghostwriting a book
for the murderer Ji Hyang-cheol.

6
00:00:28,403 --> 00:00:32,323
Ji is a notorious serial killer
who was sentenced to death

7
00:00:32,407 --> 00:00:34,659
for murdering eight women
in the early 2000s.

8
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:38,413
The police stated
that they did not find any evidence

9
00:00:38,496 --> 00:00:40,749
linking the imprisoned Ji
to the alleged book,

10
00:00:40,832 --> 00:00:45,420
and the rumors that Kim had been murdered
were dismissed as unfounded.

11
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:49,299
CONTROVERSY OVER GHOSTWRITER'S
AUTOBIOGRAPHY OF JI HYANG-CHEOL

12
00:00:49,382 --> 00:00:50,884
A giant tree fell in a forest…

13
00:00:50,967 --> 00:00:51,843
FOOTAGE FROM 2001

14
00:00:53,553 --> 00:00:55,638
and no one was around to hear it.

15
00:00:58,725 --> 00:01:02,812
Did it make a sound…

16
00:01:07,817 --> 00:01:09,319
or was there nothing but silence?

17
00:01:14,949 --> 00:01:20,747
THE FROG

18
00:01:24,375 --> 00:01:29,005
SEOUL CENTRAL POLICE AGENCY

19
00:01:31,257 --> 00:01:32,342
-Hi.
-Hello.

20
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,670
So you found the body
in the water tank on the hill.

21
00:02:09,546 --> 00:02:11,798
-Not true.
-That's what Detective Cho said.

22
00:02:15,468 --> 00:02:17,178
Seriously, how do you pull it off?

23
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:20,056
You're good at finding leads
and catching culprits.

24
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:22,183
When I see the faces of violent criminals,

25
00:02:22,267 --> 00:02:25,228
I often think,
"Really? That's who did it?"

26
00:02:26,271 --> 00:02:27,522
Is there a secret to it?

27
00:02:27,605 --> 00:02:30,150
Is it the way they walk or act?

28
00:02:32,235 --> 00:02:35,071
Does it have anything to do
with that nickname "It"?

29
00:02:41,369 --> 00:02:42,453
What do you wanna know?

30
00:02:42,537 --> 00:02:43,371
It.

31
00:02:44,664 --> 00:02:46,374
No, the water tank case first.

32
00:02:49,836 --> 00:02:52,589
-Are you going to write about it?
-I'll keep it to myself.

33
00:03:03,558 --> 00:03:04,809
The water bill.

34
00:03:57,695 --> 00:04:00,740
There's been an accident. Please hurry.

35
00:04:00,823 --> 00:04:02,992
Yes, right in front of the station.

36
00:04:04,827 --> 00:04:06,913
Yes, please hurry. Thank you.

37
00:05:28,202 --> 00:05:30,246
Are you okay?

38
00:05:37,420 --> 00:05:38,504
Is that you?

39
00:05:40,923 --> 00:05:44,135
Did you take a cab home?
I should've gone to pick you up.

40
00:05:46,763 --> 00:05:49,265
I'm sore everywhere too.

41
00:05:49,974 --> 00:05:51,017
But how strange.

42
00:05:52,477 --> 00:05:54,562
My painting is going really well.

43
00:05:54,645 --> 00:05:56,064
Did you take my bag?

44
00:05:56,773 --> 00:05:57,982
It was stressing you out.

45
00:05:59,692 --> 00:06:01,027
That dashcam footage.

46
00:06:03,154 --> 00:06:06,991
If only that footage hadn't existed,
your life would've been much easier.

47
00:06:08,951 --> 00:06:10,119
I threw it all out.

48
00:06:11,871 --> 00:06:13,539
So you can relax now.

49
00:06:15,875 --> 00:06:16,876
Get out.

50
00:06:16,959 --> 00:06:19,587
Now that the evidence is gone,
there's nothing I can do.

51
00:06:20,546 --> 00:06:22,215
I couldn't care less anymore.

52
00:06:23,716 --> 00:06:24,967
What happened here,

53
00:06:26,719 --> 00:06:28,679
I'll keep my mouth shut about it,
so leave.

54
00:06:29,263 --> 00:06:30,348
I don't want to.

55
00:06:45,988 --> 00:06:49,409
All you ever do is get angry
and tell me to leave.

56
00:06:51,744 --> 00:06:55,248
How come we're always so distant,
you and I?

57
00:06:57,083 --> 00:06:58,668
Can't we try and get along?

58
00:07:17,186 --> 00:07:19,939
-I'll leave if you can convince me.
-Convince you?

59
00:07:21,315 --> 00:07:23,151
You really don't wanna sell this place?

60
00:07:24,068 --> 00:07:29,991
The thing is, I don't understand
why you need this house more than I do.

61
00:07:30,074 --> 00:07:31,242
I just don't.

62
00:07:31,742 --> 00:07:32,827
So tell me

63
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:37,206
why you have to be
the owner of this place.

64
00:07:38,499 --> 00:07:40,918
You're asking me
why my house should be mine?

65
00:07:41,002 --> 00:07:41,919
Mister.

66
00:07:44,589 --> 00:07:45,923
Take a look around.

67
00:07:48,426 --> 00:07:50,386
It already looks like mine, doesn't it?

68
00:07:54,682 --> 00:07:56,851
You just lived here before I did.

69
00:07:58,936 --> 00:08:02,190
That's not a good reason
for this house to be yours forever.

70
00:08:33,596 --> 00:08:35,515
It was a whole different game.

71
00:08:37,016 --> 00:08:41,437
What had started as a battle for evidence
to reveal the truth

72
00:08:42,980 --> 00:08:46,317
was now a turf war
led by that crazy woman.

73
00:08:47,193 --> 00:08:49,362
You're still experiencing muscle pain,

74
00:08:49,445 --> 00:08:52,615
so I'll prescribe you
some muscle relaxants and painkillers.

75
00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:13,052
This was a fight I was less likely to win.

76
00:10:13,779 --> 00:10:15,865
-Great work, Captain.
-Good job, everyone!

77
00:10:16,782 --> 00:10:17,950
How'd it go?

78
00:10:18,034 --> 00:10:20,870
Captain Yoon… got a perfect score.

79
00:10:22,663 --> 00:10:23,748
Kim did great too.

80
00:10:26,208 --> 00:10:28,210
The chief complimented him at lunch.

81
00:10:28,294 --> 00:10:31,297
-Kim!
-Don't you get cocky, kid.

82
00:10:40,389 --> 00:10:42,558
I think I'll be done soon.

83
00:10:44,393 --> 00:10:46,562
I was able to pick up the pace.

84
00:10:46,646 --> 00:10:48,898
What about the poster and invitations?

85
00:10:50,733 --> 00:10:53,110
It's not exactly an exhibit
I want to advertise.

86
00:10:54,445 --> 00:10:56,113
Sorry. I wasn't thinking.

87
00:10:57,490 --> 00:11:02,244
Actually, let me call you back
as soon as all the pieces are done.

88
00:11:03,412 --> 00:11:04,330
Bye!

89
00:11:52,795 --> 00:11:54,547
MISTER

90
00:12:26,996 --> 00:12:28,497
Are you the rental owner?

91
00:12:35,629 --> 00:12:36,714
Jae-hwan!

92
00:12:36,797 --> 00:12:38,048
Give it!

93
00:12:39,049 --> 00:12:40,968
Hey, give it!

94
00:12:41,051 --> 00:12:43,179
Give it to me!

95
00:12:43,262 --> 00:12:45,598
So the owner hasn't been
answering your calls,

96
00:12:45,681 --> 00:12:48,184
and you arrived
only to find her staying here?

97
00:12:48,267 --> 00:12:50,436
Yes. I can't believe this is happening.

98
00:12:50,519 --> 00:12:53,105
Could you please
show me your reservation details?

99
00:12:53,189 --> 00:12:55,274
Learn to run faster, then!

100
00:12:55,775 --> 00:12:57,109
Give it!

101
00:12:57,610 --> 00:13:01,947
Weren't you in that crash a few days ago
right in front of the police station?

102
00:13:02,031 --> 00:13:03,908
The person you called is unavailable.

103
00:13:05,242 --> 00:13:06,368
Excuse me, ma'am.

104
00:13:06,452 --> 00:13:09,079
Could you show me
your reservation details?

105
00:13:55,584 --> 00:13:58,087
This device is turned off.
Your call will be directed…

106
00:13:58,170 --> 00:13:59,004
Damn it.

107
00:14:02,758 --> 00:14:05,594
I'm sure he'll be back soon
since he has guests.

108
00:14:07,805 --> 00:14:10,558
Shouldn't you be going now?
I imagine you're quite busy.

109
00:14:10,641 --> 00:14:11,642
But

110
00:14:12,852 --> 00:14:15,771
there must be details of your reservation
or the deposit you paid.

111
00:14:15,855 --> 00:14:17,356
Do you really have nothing?

112
00:14:19,525 --> 00:14:23,195
This place didn't have a website,
so I booked it in person and paid cash.

113
00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:27,700
I mentioned this to that other officer,
Choi or whatever his name was.

114
00:14:34,248 --> 00:14:35,624
But there is a website.

115
00:14:35,708 --> 00:14:36,792
FOREST VACATION RENTAL

116
00:14:37,543 --> 00:14:41,046
Any text messages?
You usually exchange them with the owner.

117
00:14:41,881 --> 00:14:44,800
To confirm the reservation,
share details about the stay, and so on.

118
00:14:45,301 --> 00:14:46,635
I delete my messages often.

119
00:14:49,221 --> 00:14:50,222
Wait.

120
00:14:50,306 --> 00:14:54,310
Are you asking me all this
because you think I'm trespassing?

121
00:14:55,603 --> 00:14:59,231
No, it just seems to me
like you're in a tough spot by yourself.

122
00:15:00,107 --> 00:15:01,025
I'm trying to help.

123
00:15:04,069 --> 00:15:05,654
I don't like your tone.

124
00:15:10,993 --> 00:15:11,827
Hey, let's go.

125
00:15:19,418 --> 00:15:21,420
MISTER

126
00:15:27,593 --> 00:15:32,681
The person you called is unavailable.
Please try again later.

127
00:15:36,268 --> 00:15:37,353
Hello, sir.

128
00:15:37,937 --> 00:15:39,939
I've finally got through to you.

129
00:15:40,773 --> 00:15:43,525
Yes, I was a bit confused at first, but…

130
00:15:46,445 --> 00:15:48,572
Oh, she's a live-in employee?

131
00:15:50,282 --> 00:15:51,283
Hello?

132
00:15:51,367 --> 00:15:53,661
Mister. Why won't you pick up my--

133
00:16:06,256 --> 00:16:08,634
Hot! Yeah, it's good.

134
00:16:10,761 --> 00:16:12,179
It's really good.

135
00:16:12,262 --> 00:16:14,014
Why are you only giving me tomatoes?

136
00:16:15,474 --> 00:16:16,642
I want some meat too!

137
00:17:22,458 --> 00:17:23,542
Ma'am.

138
00:17:24,543 --> 00:17:25,627
How have you been?

139
00:17:28,756 --> 00:17:30,924
Do you know where my grandma went?

140
00:17:43,395 --> 00:17:47,066
The flowers from your son are all wilted.
Would you like me to throw them out?

141
00:17:59,828 --> 00:18:00,829
Go back to sleep.

142
00:18:25,145 --> 00:18:25,979
Hey.

143
00:18:55,592 --> 00:18:57,594
Are you the one who spoke with the owner?

144
00:18:57,678 --> 00:19:00,013
-Yes! Hello.
-Hi. Here you go.

145
00:19:00,097 --> 00:19:01,765
-Did you enjoy your stay?
-We did.

146
00:19:01,849 --> 00:19:04,601
-I hope you didn't have any issues.
-Not at all.

147
00:19:05,644 --> 00:19:07,980
-What are you doing?
-Who are you to take the key?

148
00:19:08,063 --> 00:19:08,897
Excuse me?

149
00:19:08,981 --> 00:19:10,315
Don't worry about her.

150
00:19:10,399 --> 00:19:11,984
She works here, apparently.

151
00:19:12,067 --> 00:19:13,902
-She works here?
-Who the hell are you?

152
00:19:13,986 --> 00:19:18,157
The owner of this rental asked me
to handle the cleaning and laundry.

153
00:19:24,329 --> 00:19:26,498
You're from the laundromat? Oh my God!

154
00:19:27,332 --> 00:19:28,500
Goodness!

155
00:19:29,376 --> 00:19:30,878
You remember me, don't you?

156
00:19:32,045 --> 00:19:33,213
Do you know this woman?

157
00:19:34,423 --> 00:19:35,257
No.

158
00:19:36,175 --> 00:19:37,342
I'm afraid not.

159
00:19:37,426 --> 00:19:40,429
Just ignore her. She's a weird one.

160
00:19:41,930 --> 00:19:43,056
Hey, give that back.

161
00:19:43,140 --> 00:19:45,142
What do you think you're doing?

162
00:19:45,934 --> 00:19:47,853
-Take care.
-Thanks. We had a great time.

163
00:19:47,936 --> 00:19:49,855
-Fucking bullshit!
-Come back soon.

164
00:19:49,938 --> 00:19:51,106
-Will do!
-Goodbye!

165
00:20:00,699 --> 00:20:01,700
What do you want?

166
00:20:04,870 --> 00:20:07,873
What's wrong with you?
Hey, leave me alone!

167
00:20:10,042 --> 00:20:11,293
An obnoxious guest?

168
00:20:12,377 --> 00:20:15,380
Just tell them off on the spot
whenever they break the rules.

169
00:20:16,089 --> 00:20:18,926
If that doesn't stop them,
you gotta call the police.

170
00:20:22,971 --> 00:20:23,805
The police?

171
00:20:27,517 --> 00:20:30,687
There are obnoxious customers everywhere,
but they're toxic in this business.

172
00:20:30,771 --> 00:20:31,939
Don't let them slide.

173
00:20:34,566 --> 00:20:36,068
Illegal gambling, drugs…

174
00:20:36,151 --> 00:20:39,529
If they get drunk and look like trouble,
I call the cops right away.

175
00:20:41,949 --> 00:20:43,742
What if that isn't an option?

176
00:20:44,660 --> 00:20:46,411
Yeah, the real problem

177
00:20:46,495 --> 00:20:49,998
is when the trouble
is not serious enough to call the cops.

178
00:20:50,082 --> 00:20:53,669
In that case, all you can do
is wait for that guest to leave.

179
00:21:00,217 --> 00:21:02,636
-What if they won't leave?
-What?

180
00:21:05,430 --> 00:21:08,267
Why wouldn't they?
Everyone has to go home eventually.

181
00:21:09,601 --> 00:21:12,437
They have to head out
when it's time to check out.

182
00:21:12,938 --> 00:21:16,024
That way, you can welcome the next guest.

183
00:21:23,156 --> 00:21:24,408
The next guest?

184
00:21:29,538 --> 00:21:30,914
Hurry up!

185
00:21:33,625 --> 00:21:34,543
Darn it.

186
00:21:47,806 --> 00:21:49,474
Hey, this is fucking awesome.

187
00:21:49,558 --> 00:21:51,226
-Too nice!
-It's this place?

188
00:21:51,310 --> 00:21:52,477
-Holy shit!
-Hey!

189
00:22:28,513 --> 00:22:30,182
What the hell are you doing?

190
00:22:47,616 --> 00:22:49,034
God-fucking-damn it.

191
00:23:02,381 --> 00:23:04,132
God!

192
00:23:15,519 --> 00:23:16,686
Can I get a toothbrush?

193
00:23:16,770 --> 00:23:17,604
What?

194
00:23:18,146 --> 00:23:19,314
Whoa.

195
00:23:23,193 --> 00:23:25,529
He said he had toothbrushes
on the second shelf

196
00:23:25,612 --> 00:23:28,782
of the bathroom cabinet,
and the auntie here would get them for me.

197
00:23:28,865 --> 00:23:29,950
Who?

198
00:23:31,660 --> 00:23:32,744
Who?

199
00:23:32,828 --> 00:23:33,703
The owner.

200
00:23:33,787 --> 00:23:35,455
No, who are you calling "auntie"?

201
00:23:36,623 --> 00:23:39,209
Well, you don't look like a "miss" to me!

202
00:23:53,849 --> 00:23:54,683
Miss!

203
00:23:55,767 --> 00:23:57,310
Two toothbrushes, please.

204
00:24:14,369 --> 00:24:17,622
Two of the same color? Seriously?

205
00:24:17,706 --> 00:24:19,791
-Keep it down out there.
-What?

206
00:24:22,794 --> 00:24:24,129
Are you guys of legal age?

207
00:24:25,213 --> 00:24:26,298
Let me see your IDs.

208
00:24:26,381 --> 00:24:27,966
We are adults, okay?

209
00:24:28,049 --> 00:24:28,967
Your IDs.

210
00:24:30,260 --> 00:24:31,344
Should I call the cops?

211
00:24:31,428 --> 00:24:33,138
This is a fucking joke.

212
00:24:33,638 --> 00:24:35,432
Clean up and go inside in ten minutes.

213
00:24:36,475 --> 00:24:38,560
I dare you to call the cops on us.

214
00:24:38,643 --> 00:24:40,729
They'll shut your rental down.

215
00:24:41,813 --> 00:24:43,064
Shut this place down?

216
00:24:43,773 --> 00:24:45,317
That's exactly what I want.

217
00:24:47,736 --> 00:24:49,821
-Get out.
-What do you think you're doing?

218
00:24:49,905 --> 00:24:52,240
-Get out.
-Are you for real?

219
00:24:53,992 --> 00:24:54,826
Go.

220
00:24:57,037 --> 00:24:58,455
What the hell's wrong with you?

221
00:25:35,492 --> 00:25:36,826
-You!
-What?

222
00:25:36,910 --> 00:25:38,954
Bye, Auntie!

223
00:25:39,037 --> 00:25:41,373
-Run!
-Nice fucking throw!

224
00:25:59,724 --> 00:26:01,726
-Where are you?
-You're still there?

225
00:26:01,810 --> 00:26:03,895
Hiding out
and pulling cheap tricks, are you?

226
00:26:06,982 --> 00:26:07,983
Cheap tricks?

227
00:26:09,317 --> 00:26:12,654
A rental is meant to have guests.
If anything, you're the weird one here.

228
00:26:14,030 --> 00:26:16,616
Everyone thinks you're weird, don't they?

229
00:26:20,203 --> 00:26:21,997
Just get here. Let's talk this out.

230
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:23,456
More guests will be coming.

231
00:26:23,540 --> 00:26:26,376
I have a lot of group bookings.
Maybe because it's peak season.

232
00:26:27,294 --> 00:26:28,962
Do you think this is helping you?

233
00:26:29,045 --> 00:26:33,466
Clean the place up if you have time.
I can't send anyone there, thanks to you.

234
00:26:37,262 --> 00:26:38,847
Fucking hell.

235
00:26:43,310 --> 00:26:44,269
Mister.

236
00:26:45,353 --> 00:26:47,272
Want me to kill your fucking daughter?

237
00:26:48,815 --> 00:26:50,025
SLIDE TO POWER OFF

238
00:26:50,609 --> 00:26:51,484
MISTER

239
00:26:51,568 --> 00:26:53,153
This device is turned off…

240
00:28:28,873 --> 00:28:30,208
What happened to the window?

241
00:29:15,336 --> 00:29:19,132
Apparently, he was working on
Ji's autobiography right before he died.

242
00:29:19,215 --> 00:29:22,635
Only one individual was captured
on a nearby security cam

243
00:29:22,719 --> 00:29:24,053
at the time of his death,

244
00:29:24,554 --> 00:29:27,140
but it isn't certain
if the two are connected.

245
00:29:27,223 --> 00:29:28,641
Plus, it was a month ago.

246
00:29:38,777 --> 00:29:39,944
Did they do an autopsy?

247
00:29:40,028 --> 00:29:43,656
No. He was hanged, and he left a note,
so it was ruled suicide. He was cremated.

248
00:29:44,449 --> 00:29:48,286
Cho looked into everyone the victim knew
and found no viable suspects.

249
00:29:48,369 --> 00:29:52,916
He even looked at all those
who knew one of Ji's victims, but nothing.

250
00:29:52,999 --> 00:29:54,876
Was he really writing Ji's autobiography?

251
00:29:54,959 --> 00:29:58,379
Ji said he didn't know about it,
and the victim never talked to publishers,

252
00:29:58,463 --> 00:30:00,632
so it's possible he was delusional.

253
00:30:01,216 --> 00:30:04,636
But after the news,
everyone's fixated on that story.

254
00:30:04,719 --> 00:30:06,721
Do you think Ji's related to this?

255
00:30:08,306 --> 00:30:10,725
Well, I was hoping you could tell me.

256
00:30:12,227 --> 00:30:13,478
I don't know anymore.

257
00:30:18,149 --> 00:30:19,150
You doing all right?

258
00:30:20,151 --> 00:30:20,985
Yeah.

259
00:30:22,821 --> 00:30:23,822
Aren't you bored?

260
00:30:38,419 --> 00:30:39,254
No.

261
00:31:11,035 --> 00:31:12,787
Going on vacation. Lucky you.

262
00:31:14,831 --> 00:31:17,750
-What are your plans?
-Don't even think about calling me.

263
00:31:17,834 --> 00:31:19,919
Speak for yourself, kid.

264
00:31:20,753 --> 00:31:23,172
Your uniform!
You're not going to change out of it?

265
00:31:23,756 --> 00:31:25,258
I need to take care of something.

266
00:31:34,142 --> 00:31:36,269
-Hello?
-Hi there.

267
00:31:36,352 --> 00:31:40,189
We got here a little early,
but the lady here won't hand over the key.

268
00:31:40,690 --> 00:31:41,858
I'll be right there.

269
00:32:09,844 --> 00:32:10,929
The key, please.

270
00:32:37,705 --> 00:32:38,539
Mister.

271
00:32:39,958 --> 00:32:41,542
What if she gets into the house?

272
00:32:41,626 --> 00:32:44,462
That would be trespassing.
Call the police right away.

273
00:32:44,545 --> 00:32:46,547
-Let me clean up quickly.
-Okay.

274
00:32:51,552 --> 00:32:53,137
Good to finally see you.

275
00:32:55,139 --> 00:32:56,808
You can leave that over here.

276
00:32:58,101 --> 00:33:00,395
I'm Officer Kim Seon-tae
at Hosu Police Station.

277
00:33:00,478 --> 00:33:01,729
What brings you here?

278
00:33:02,897 --> 00:33:05,358
I made the reservation.
Those guys are my buddies.

279
00:33:08,152 --> 00:33:09,570
So you were close by.

280
00:33:09,654 --> 00:33:12,740
Why did you make it so hard
for that woman for days on end?

281
00:33:15,410 --> 00:33:19,163
I hope you weren't trying to harass her
and mess with her

282
00:33:19,247 --> 00:33:21,582
simply because she's a woman by herself.

283
00:33:22,166 --> 00:33:23,418
A woman by herself…

284
00:33:25,211 --> 00:33:26,546
Are you talking about her?

285
00:33:27,338 --> 00:33:30,341
The world has changed.
You'll land yourself in big trouble.

286
00:33:31,175 --> 00:33:32,176
Let's head in, guys.

287
00:33:43,896 --> 00:33:44,856
You called the cops?

288
00:33:46,524 --> 00:33:48,192
He offered to help me first.

289
00:33:52,697 --> 00:33:53,698
Your face…

290
00:33:55,324 --> 00:33:58,119
What in the world
have you been getting yourself into?

291
00:34:16,387 --> 00:34:18,473
Three, two, one!

292
00:34:43,664 --> 00:34:44,499
Join us.

293
00:34:44,582 --> 00:34:47,752
No! Don't!

294
00:34:49,378 --> 00:34:50,213
Hey!

295
00:34:54,926 --> 00:34:57,261
Hey, you drive.

296
00:34:57,345 --> 00:34:59,597
-No way. You drive.
-Then you pay for everything.

297
00:35:00,431 --> 00:35:02,100
-We'll be going, then.
-Good night.

298
00:35:02,183 --> 00:35:03,434
-Bye!
-You're so pretty!

299
00:35:03,518 --> 00:35:04,352
Thank you.

300
00:35:04,936 --> 00:35:06,187
Get home safe.

301
00:35:12,026 --> 00:35:14,529
-You sure you can stay by yourself?
-Of course.

302
00:35:15,571 --> 00:35:17,573
You think you're brave, don't you?

303
00:35:20,409 --> 00:35:22,245
Leave the bags. I'll help you tomorrow.

304
00:35:23,538 --> 00:35:25,373
-Don't you have work?
-I'm on vacation.

305
00:35:30,044 --> 00:35:30,878
See ya.

306
00:36:46,954 --> 00:36:47,788
How's the food?

307
00:36:49,415 --> 00:36:50,249
It's not bad.

308
00:36:53,336 --> 00:36:55,671
Don't you think you owe her an apology?

309
00:36:59,675 --> 00:37:04,472
As an officer, I've met way too many men
who act entitled because they're older.

310
00:37:04,555 --> 00:37:06,766
All they have left is their stupid pride.

311
00:37:08,184 --> 00:37:11,604
They still think they're in the prime
of their lives. It's pathetic.

312
00:37:11,687 --> 00:37:12,688
That sounds rough.

313
00:37:14,023 --> 00:37:15,775
And you can tell that at first glance?

314
00:37:17,068 --> 00:37:17,902
I can.

315
00:37:19,695 --> 00:37:21,530
You must be good at reading people.

316
00:37:25,159 --> 00:37:26,410
I have a bottle of wine.

317
00:37:26,994 --> 00:37:29,830
Why don't we have a glass
and clear the air?

318
00:37:46,264 --> 00:37:47,848
Why did you become a cop?

319
00:38:24,093 --> 00:38:26,262
Have you drunk anything she's poured you?

320
00:38:28,055 --> 00:38:29,515
I wouldn't if I were you.

321
00:38:55,583 --> 00:38:57,335
That fucking son of a…

322
00:39:09,764 --> 00:39:10,681
I need a toothbrush.

323
00:39:33,704 --> 00:39:35,039
Thanks to you, Mister,

324
00:39:36,415 --> 00:39:38,334
that jerk won't go home.

325
00:39:39,710 --> 00:39:41,837
-He's gonna sleep on the second floor.
-So?

326
00:39:42,546 --> 00:39:43,464
He's so annoying.

327
00:39:43,547 --> 00:39:46,717
I hate him so much. So dumb and chatty.

328
00:39:48,010 --> 00:39:50,429
Can't you work with me just this once?

329
00:39:50,930 --> 00:39:54,183
We'll tell him we've made up
and get him out of here.

330
00:39:54,767 --> 00:39:56,894
But he's the guest, not you.

331
00:39:56,977 --> 00:39:58,396
He's a cop, you know.

332
00:39:59,480 --> 00:40:00,564
You can't let him stay.

333
00:40:01,148 --> 00:40:04,068
-I'd feel safer with a cop here.
-For God's sake.

334
00:40:07,321 --> 00:40:08,823
Mister. How about we

335
00:40:10,741 --> 00:40:12,410
split this place in half?

336
00:40:22,169 --> 00:40:23,087
Split in half?

337
00:40:23,170 --> 00:40:24,004
Yeah.

338
00:40:24,672 --> 00:40:27,007
We can meet in the middle.

339
00:40:27,925 --> 00:40:30,428
To be honest, I don't need this room.

340
00:40:31,429 --> 00:40:34,515
So I'll live here,
and you'll live over there?

341
00:40:35,391 --> 00:40:37,059
-That's your idea?
-Yeah.

342
00:40:40,396 --> 00:40:41,730
You crazy bitch.

343
00:40:44,692 --> 00:40:46,026
Don't call me that.

344
00:40:46,610 --> 00:40:50,281
Do you expect me to say yes
to living with a murderer?

345
00:40:55,953 --> 00:40:57,788
Wanna know how I killed him?

346
00:40:59,999 --> 00:41:01,750
What I did to Si-hyeon,

347
00:41:02,668 --> 00:41:04,086
in great detail, step by step.

348
00:41:04,879 --> 00:41:09,717
Do you think you can keep living here
even after hearing what I did?

349
00:41:11,135 --> 00:41:12,386
Just face it.

350
00:41:13,846 --> 00:41:15,473
This place is already mine.

351
00:41:16,140 --> 00:41:18,767
I'm giving you this room
because I feel sorry for your ass.

352
00:41:37,369 --> 00:41:38,245
This place is mine.

353
00:41:39,580 --> 00:41:41,081
That's the only reason I need.

354
00:41:42,208 --> 00:41:44,376
I won't let you have a piece of it.

355
00:42:32,633 --> 00:42:33,634
What happened?

356
00:42:37,012 --> 00:42:37,888
Hold on.

357
00:46:16,440 --> 00:46:18,108
POLICE

358
00:46:30,871 --> 00:46:32,706
This is my house. My room.

359
00:46:35,125 --> 00:46:36,543
And that's my bed.

360
00:46:37,711 --> 00:46:38,545
Get out.

361
00:46:41,173 --> 00:46:42,049
Get out.

362
00:46:44,885 --> 00:46:48,388
You might be a paying guest,
but this is still trespassing.

363
00:46:49,056 --> 00:46:50,140
How dare you two…

364
00:46:53,310 --> 00:46:55,562
-Have you completely lost your mind?
-Hey.

365
00:46:55,646 --> 00:46:59,233
I'm not holding any weapons.
Let go. Let go of me first.

366
00:46:59,316 --> 00:47:02,319
You're a cop, aren't you?

367
00:47:03,070 --> 00:47:04,738
Wake the hell up, you idiot!

368
00:47:05,697 --> 00:47:07,825
Give me a break!

369
00:47:09,034 --> 00:47:12,830
You'll break my arm!
Let go of my arm. I'll stop.

370
00:47:13,831 --> 00:47:15,082
Wake up, you idiot.

371
00:47:20,420 --> 00:47:21,505
Are you insane?

372
00:47:55,247 --> 00:47:58,292
I heard Officer Kim responded
to a call at your rental recently.

373
00:47:58,375 --> 00:48:01,295
-Was there some kind of problem?
-No.

374
00:48:04,047 --> 00:48:05,883
What about the time you came down here?

375
00:48:09,136 --> 00:48:11,555
You came in and then left right away.

376
00:48:13,473 --> 00:48:14,892
What brought you here that day?

377
00:48:22,482 --> 00:48:27,279
My guests are only permitted to use
the main house, the yard, and the pool.

378
00:48:28,572 --> 00:48:31,742
Those two people were
in my personal living space.

379
00:48:33,911 --> 00:48:35,746
I was angry that they barged in.

380
00:48:37,748 --> 00:48:39,917
Have you ever hit someone out of anger?

381
00:48:41,460 --> 00:48:43,295
Well, don't get me wrong.

382
00:48:43,378 --> 00:48:47,883
It's just that only anger causes those
without experience to throw a punch.

383
00:48:48,884 --> 00:48:50,969
Getting into street fights
or practicing martial arts

384
00:48:51,053 --> 00:48:53,180
requires a catalyst
like computer games, alcohol, drugs,

385
00:48:53,263 --> 00:48:55,307
or having been an assault victim.

386
00:48:55,390 --> 00:48:59,811
Something has to open the door
for one's rage to lead to actual punches.

387
00:49:03,440 --> 00:49:04,524
Are you telling me

388
00:49:06,276 --> 00:49:08,153
that someone like me

389
00:49:10,030 --> 00:49:12,449
has no choice but to sit back
and do nothing?

390
00:49:12,532 --> 00:49:15,160
Is there anything
you want to do something about?

391
00:49:27,714 --> 00:49:29,549
I came here that day to file a report.

392
00:49:29,633 --> 00:49:30,801
What was it about?

393
00:49:41,395 --> 00:49:42,604
It's all in the past.

394
00:49:44,648 --> 00:49:45,732
There's nothing left.

395
00:49:49,277 --> 00:49:50,612
I can still give it a listen.

396
00:50:04,626 --> 00:50:05,627
OFFICER KIM SEON-TAE

397
00:50:11,008 --> 00:50:12,426
Excuse me for a moment.

398
00:50:33,447 --> 00:50:34,698
Can I go home?

399
00:50:40,120 --> 00:50:41,788
-Let me give you a ride.
-No.

400
00:50:47,669 --> 00:50:51,006
What happened today with Officer Kim,
can we pretend it never occurred?

401
00:50:52,382 --> 00:50:56,303
I don't want him
ever coming back to my rental.

402
00:50:58,305 --> 00:50:59,973
I'll refund him the deposit.

403
00:51:00,557 --> 00:51:01,975
I'll pass on the message.

404
00:51:36,301 --> 00:51:38,345
On your first day of vacation, really?

405
00:51:40,097 --> 00:51:42,599
You didn't have to come.

406
00:51:43,100 --> 00:51:44,810
I was patrolling the area anyway.

407
00:51:46,144 --> 00:51:48,522
Boss smoothed things over
with the rental owner.

408
00:51:49,106 --> 00:51:50,357
What about the lady?

409
00:51:51,900 --> 00:51:52,818
Seon-tae.

410
00:51:55,362 --> 00:51:58,740
You don't want to stay at a tiny station
until you're my age.

411
00:51:59,282 --> 00:52:03,203
Don't get yourself tangled up in trouble
when you're so close to a promotion.

412
00:52:05,288 --> 00:52:06,998
You understand, don't you?

413
00:52:08,625 --> 00:52:09,459
Yes, sir.

414
00:52:10,710 --> 00:52:13,213
Let's go. I'll give you a ride home.

415
00:52:13,296 --> 00:52:15,465
That's okay. I'll take a cab.

416
00:52:17,384 --> 00:52:18,218
You do that.

417
00:52:19,803 --> 00:52:20,971
See you, then!

418
00:52:21,054 --> 00:52:22,139
Have a good night.

419
00:55:23,028 --> 00:55:24,529
SERGEANT CHOI JEONG-HO

420
00:55:54,642 --> 00:55:56,478
THE CRAZY WOMAN

421
00:56:22,128 --> 00:56:24,464
Why did you have to take things this far?

422
00:56:26,383 --> 00:56:28,468
I'll sell the rental to you.

423
00:56:36,893 --> 00:56:37,977
Do you mean that?

424
00:56:40,814 --> 00:56:41,731
Those words…

425
00:56:44,150 --> 00:56:46,111
mean so much to me right now.

426
00:56:48,571 --> 00:56:49,823
Just wait a few days.

427
00:56:55,703 --> 00:56:58,289
Moisture, to be precise.

428
00:57:01,376 --> 00:57:03,837
There wasn't a single bit of moisture
in that house.

429
00:57:06,673 --> 00:57:09,926
The property hadn't been billed
for water for the past two months.

430
00:57:11,344 --> 00:57:14,347
"The pipes are working fine.
Why didn't the suspect use any water?"

431
00:57:18,101 --> 00:57:21,938
I checked the water tank on the rooftop,
and there was nothing inside.

432
00:57:28,194 --> 00:57:31,448
But from that rooftop,
I could see the water tank on the hill.

433
00:57:31,531 --> 00:57:33,533
It turns out
they couldn't use the tap water

434
00:57:34,033 --> 00:57:36,286
because it reminded them
of the body they dumped.

435
00:57:40,039 --> 00:57:43,209
How do you figure that out
from just seeing those things?

436
00:57:43,293 --> 00:57:44,627
It's not what you see.

437
00:57:45,420 --> 00:57:46,504
It's the opposite.

438
00:57:47,005 --> 00:57:49,757
Not what's there, not what you can see,

439
00:57:50,258 --> 00:57:54,095
but what's gone,
what isn't there when it should be.

440
00:57:54,679 --> 00:57:56,764
-That's what I chase after.
-What isn't there…

441
00:57:56,848 --> 00:58:00,477
Do you mean in that person's daily life
or surroundings?

442
00:58:01,060 --> 00:58:02,479
In the people themselves too.

443
00:58:04,647 --> 00:58:08,318
I think about what emotion,
what behavior they aren't showing,

444
00:58:09,319 --> 00:58:13,740
what words are missing in their statement,
what time frame they've left out,

445
00:58:13,823 --> 00:58:15,492
and what they avoid looking at.

446
00:58:20,413 --> 00:58:21,372
But…

447
00:58:23,416 --> 00:58:26,252
you need to sort out
some suspects first, don't you?

448
00:58:27,086 --> 00:58:29,172
I mean, you can't suspect everyone.

449
00:58:35,845 --> 00:58:36,763
But I do.

450
00:58:39,015 --> 00:58:40,183
I suspect everyone.

451
00:58:42,268 --> 00:58:46,272
Victims, their families,
their neighbors, and witnesses.

452
00:58:48,691 --> 00:58:49,859
My colleagues too.

453
00:58:51,027 --> 00:58:56,032
My family, my neighbors,
Team Leader Kang, Detective Cho.

454
00:58:59,536 --> 00:59:01,120
Everyone in this building

455
00:59:02,539 --> 00:59:04,541
and everyone outside of it.

456
00:59:05,333 --> 00:59:08,336
And even you,
the person sitting next to me.

457
00:59:10,046 --> 00:59:12,215
I see everyone equally.

458
00:59:13,841 --> 00:59:15,677
I don't make an exception.

459
00:59:18,805 --> 00:59:19,722
You're thorough.

460
00:59:23,226 --> 00:59:26,980
I'm saying that I'm not some heroic cop
who catches criminals for justice.

461
00:59:28,982 --> 00:59:29,899
I'm just…

462
01:00:32,295 --> 01:00:33,796
I'm just

463
01:00:35,340 --> 01:00:38,509
the "It" in the fun game we are playing.
