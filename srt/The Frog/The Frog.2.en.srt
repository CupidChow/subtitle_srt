00:30:23,571 --> 00:30:26,574
[Yeong-ha] Who will be the one
to knock on the doors of fate?

359
00:30:26,658 --> 00:30:28,159
[melancholy piano music playing]

360
00:30:28,243 --> 00:30:29,410
Will it be the police?

361
00:30:31,579 --> 00:30:33,665
[breathes deeply]

362
00:30:33,748 --> 00:30:35,708
Or will the killer come knocking first?

363
00:30:36,209 --> 00:30:38,211
[Yeong-ha panting]

364
00:30:44,217 --> 00:30:46,511
[gasping, wheezing]

365
00:30:46,594 --> 00:30:47,887
[coughs]

366
00:30:48,471 --> 00:30:50,473
[breathing heavily]

367
00:30:54,185 --> 00:30:56,062
[Yeong-ha] But even
as the seasons changed,

368
00:30:56,938 --> 00:30:58,314
no one came knocking.

369
00:30:59,190 --> 00:31:00,024
[sighs]

370
00:31:00,567 --> 00:31:04,571
[Yeong-ha] And soon enough,
I couldn't even remember her face anymore.

371
00:31:09,701 --> 00:31:12,996
Maybe everything that happened that day
was just in my head.

372
00:31:14,873 --> 00:31:15,790
Just

373
00:31:17,166 --> 00:31:18,459
a bad dream.

374
00:31:20,336 --> 00:31:22,589
Day in and day out, I kept holding on

375
00:31:24,215 --> 00:31:25,884
to the worst kind of hope.

376
00:31:26,384 --> 00:31:28,595
[machinery whirring]

377
00:31:37,645 --> 00:31:39,397
-[task leader] Okay, let's go!
-Right.

378
00:31:45,778 --> 00:31:47,822
[melancholy piano music continues]

379
00:31:49,073 --> 00:31:50,241
[wind whistling]

380
00:31:51,159 --> 00:31:52,744
[Yeong-ha] The worst kind of hope.

381
00:31:52,827 --> 00:31:54,329
[Eun-gyeong] Enjoy your meal.

382
00:31:54,412 --> 00:31:56,873
[Yeong-ha] Or maybe, maybe you could say…

383
00:31:56,956 --> 00:31:58,708
[woman] Eun-gyeong,
can you get that delivery?

384
00:31:58,791 --> 00:31:59,709
Ah, yes.

385
00:32:00,877 --> 00:32:03,588
[Yeong-ha] …that we were living
in the best kind of despair.

386
00:32:10,345 --> 00:32:11,429
[music fades]

387
00:32:11,512 --> 00:32:12,972
[door opens]

388
00:32:13,056 --> 00:32:14,515
[Sang-jun] I'm home, Gi-ho.

389
00:32:17,810 --> 00:32:18,937
Koo Gi-ho.

390
00:32:21,147 --> 00:32:22,690
[sighs] This kid…

391
00:32:48,925 --> 00:32:49,968
[keypad beeps]

392
00:32:50,051 --> 00:32:51,010
[phone chimes]

393
00:32:51,844 --> 00:32:53,596
SANG-JUN

394
00:32:53,680 --> 00:32:56,057
-[Eun-gyeong breathing heavily]
-[phone buzzing]

395
00:33:00,645 --> 00:33:02,105
[phone continues buzzing]

396
00:33:22,208 --> 00:33:23,543
[phone ringing]

397
00:33:26,879 --> 00:33:28,256
[uneasy music playing]

398
00:33:34,053 --> 00:33:35,430
[phone continues ringing]

399
00:33:42,812 --> 00:33:44,439
Hi, this is Lake View Motel.

400
00:33:44,522 --> 00:33:47,191
-[man 6] They picked up.
-[woman] Is this the Ji Hyang-cheol Motel?

401
00:33:47,275 --> 00:33:48,735
[man 6] You mean the murder motel.

402
00:33:48,818 --> 00:33:50,820
[callers laughing]

403
00:33:50,903 --> 00:33:53,281
[man 7] Murder motel?
Shit, that's hella scary!

404
00:33:53,364 --> 00:33:54,323
[callers laughing]

405
00:33:55,324 --> 00:33:56,325
[sighs]

406
00:34:02,498 --> 00:34:03,666
Eun-gyeong.

407
00:34:05,710 --> 00:34:09,047
[whispering] Don't! Don't!
Leave them alone. Let them be, please!

408
00:34:09,130 --> 00:34:10,339
Go mind the store!

409
00:34:11,090 --> 00:34:14,469
-You really shouldn't do this.
-Really, now? Go, get out of here!

410
00:34:14,552 --> 00:34:16,554
-[man 5 grunts]
-[sighs]

411
00:34:27,398 --> 00:34:28,441
[lighter clicks]

412
00:34:29,901 --> 00:34:31,319
[Eun-gyeong] Say that again?

413
00:34:34,572 --> 00:34:36,240
[Sang-jun] Let's close the motel.

414
00:34:41,913 --> 00:34:43,081
[Sang-jun sighs]

415
00:34:43,164 --> 00:34:44,749
It's been half a year already.

416
00:34:46,834 --> 00:34:48,878
Let's just sell it and…

417
00:34:54,467 --> 00:34:56,135
-[woman] What?
-[Sang-jun] Eun-gyeong.

418
00:34:56,219 --> 00:34:57,386
[man 5] Oh, it's cold!

419
00:34:57,470 --> 00:34:59,555
[woman] Oh, what's… Oh my!

420
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:02,100
-[man 5 grunts]
-[woman] What's the--

421
00:35:02,183 --> 00:35:04,310
-[panting] Eun-gyeong.
-[Eun-gyeong sighs]

422
00:35:05,186 --> 00:35:08,856
Gi-ho is gonna start junior high.
What are we supposed to do then, huh?

423
00:35:11,150 --> 00:35:12,777
We'll cross that bridge when we get there.

424
00:35:12,860 --> 00:35:14,695
I'm barely covering our expenses.

425
00:35:15,238 --> 00:35:17,156
That's not even mentioning our debts.

426
00:35:17,657 --> 00:35:20,243
Think we can get by
with what you're earning?

427
00:35:22,537 --> 00:35:24,747
What? That hurt your pride?

428
00:35:26,415 --> 00:35:28,292
-I threw mine away a long time ago.
-[sighs]

429
00:35:29,043 --> 00:35:32,547
[Eun-gyeong] I always hear customers
whispering about me at the restaurant,

430
00:35:34,215 --> 00:35:37,426
and I can say the same
about the other mothers at Gi-ho's school.

431
00:35:41,931 --> 00:35:43,516
-Eun-gyeong.
-You think

432
00:35:44,433 --> 00:35:47,478
that I've just been sitting here
waiting for you to sell the motel?

433
00:35:50,773 --> 00:35:53,943
-Oh my. What do we do? What do we do?
-Shit!

434
00:35:55,153 --> 00:35:56,112
[woman] Jong-du!

435
00:35:57,488 --> 00:35:59,699
What did he even do, huh? Huh?

436
00:35:59,782 --> 00:36:02,076
If he fucked up somehow, I'd get it.
I'd be all for it.

437
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:05,371
But seriously, why?
Does tearing him down make it easier, huh?

438
00:36:05,454 --> 00:36:07,165
-Is that why you're--
-Back the fuck off!

439
00:36:07,248 --> 00:36:10,168
Who the hell do you think you are, huh?
This is between me and her--

440
00:36:10,251 --> 00:36:11,919
-[Jong-du] Stupid motherfucker!
-[grunts]

441
00:36:12,003 --> 00:36:15,381
[woman] Hey, hey, hey, hey!
Stop it! Don't! Quit it! I'm serious!

442
00:36:15,464 --> 00:36:17,842
Stop it, you two!
If you don't, I'm gonna get mad!

443
00:36:17,925 --> 00:36:19,135
[woman whimpers]

444
00:36:19,218 --> 00:36:20,553
[grunting]

445
00:36:20,636 --> 00:36:22,597
-Damn it!
-[Jong-du] You fucker.

446
00:36:22,680 --> 00:36:24,724
-[Sang-jun] Oh, ma'am! Ma'am!
-Christ!

447
00:36:24,807 --> 00:36:26,601
-[Sang-jun] Ma'am, are you okay?
-[woman moans]

448
00:36:26,684 --> 00:36:29,604
-[Sang-jun] Jeez.
-Yeah, yeah, yeah. I'm fine. It's fine.

449
00:36:29,687 --> 00:36:31,439
Could you get any lower than this?

450
00:36:32,231 --> 00:36:35,651
[woman] Sang-jun. Sang-jun.
Stop it, all right?

451
00:36:36,652 --> 00:36:39,780
-Please stop. Sang-jun. Sang-jun!
-Shit.

452
00:36:40,656 --> 00:36:42,408
-[woman] Sang-jun.
-[Sang-jun panting]

453
00:36:43,284 --> 00:36:46,454
You're right! All of it is on me, huh?

454
00:36:46,537 --> 00:36:48,456
So where do you want me to start, huh?

455
00:36:48,539 --> 00:36:52,126
I should've seen that he was
a murderer that night, right?

456
00:36:52,210 --> 00:36:55,880
No, actually, the whole motel
was a mistake from the start.

457
00:36:56,547 --> 00:36:57,381
Wasn't it?

458
00:36:57,882 --> 00:36:59,508
Should I say sorry for bringing us here?

459
00:36:59,592 --> 00:37:02,428
Or even proposing to you.
What about that, huh?

460
00:37:03,221 --> 00:37:05,806
I mean, can you tell me
where I made a mistake, huh?

461
00:37:06,849 --> 00:37:09,727
[breathing heavily]

462
00:37:11,896 --> 00:37:13,731
You're really something else, Eun-gyeong.

463
00:37:15,149 --> 00:37:16,317
I'm in pain too.

464
00:37:17,401 --> 00:37:18,653
I'm hurting here too.

465
00:37:19,362 --> 00:37:22,156
It's not just you.
It's not just you! What?

466
00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:23,199
Are you done?

467
00:37:36,003 --> 00:37:36,837
[sighs]

468
00:37:37,338 --> 00:37:38,506
Goddamn it.

469
00:37:42,927 --> 00:37:44,804
[breathing heavily]

470
00:37:48,307 --> 00:37:50,184
It's this fucking motel, isn't it?

471
00:37:50,268 --> 00:37:52,520
[panting] Shit!

472
00:37:53,479 --> 00:37:56,190

00:38:26,846 --> 00:38:28,764
Want some more, fucker? Come on!

482
00:38:31,058 --> 00:38:32,226
Sang-jun.

483
00:38:32,310 --> 00:38:35,021
Goddammit. Fuck this shit.

484
00:38:35,104 --> 00:38:37,106
[footsteps rapidly retreating]

-[Jong-du] Sang-jun.
-Come off! It won't come off!

499
00:39:56,227 --> 00:39:58,687
-C'mon, Sang-jun.
-Let go! Let go of me!

500
00:39:58,771 --> 00:40:01,524
-Stop it, man! Sang-jun, don't!
-It won't come off! [sobs]

501
00:40:02,108 --> 00:40:06,070

[doorbell rings]

512
00:40:42,773 --> 00:40:44,984
[Gi-ho] He ended up
closing down the motel.

513
00:40:46,902 --> 00:40:49,738
Not one year after
the Ji Hyang-cheol incident.

514

[officer sighs]

515
00:40:52,158 --> 00:40:53,784
-[young Bo-min] Good work, sir.
-You too.

HE MUST BE PERMANENTLY ISOLATED

[melancholy music playing]

521
00:41:18,893 --> 00:41:20,311
ONE YEAR SINCE JI'S ARREST

522
00:41:43,083 --> 00:41:44,793
[officer 2] Hey, let's get lunch first.

523
00:41:44,877 --> 00:41:46,128
[officer 1] Okay.

524
00:41:46,212 --> 00:41:47,630
[officer 2] Should we get noodles?

-[officer 1] Yeah, sounds great.
-[officer 2] Okay.

526
00:41:49,798 --> 00:41:51,050
[officer 1] C'mon, Officer Yoon.

527
00:42:21,997 --> 00:42:25,209
[realtor] Yeah, no one's expressed
an interest in buying it yet,

528
00:42:25,292 --> 00:42:27,586
but we just gotta be patient.

529
00:42:28,128 --> 00:42:32,216
I've been a realtor for a long time,

every place finds an owner.

531
00:42:35,261 --> 00:42:36,136

[guest 2] Oh, that smells delicious.
That's Gi-ho's mom.

536
00:42:50,276 --> 00:42:51,735
Did you hear about the motel?

537
00:42:51,819 --> 00:42:55,072

00:43:24,935 --> 00:43:28,606
[teacher] Then this changes, right?
Then what happens? It's a one, right?

548
00:43:28,689 --> 00:43:31,233
Now, if we summarize this formula,

549
00:43:31,942 --> 00:43:36,530
it's going to be x cubed y over xy…

550
00:43:36,614 --> 00:43:37,823
[ticking echoes]

551
00:43:37,906 --> 00:43:40,326

Okay, take a seat.

-Good work, guys.
-[Choi] Thanks for all your hard work.

Are you seriously knocked out, huh?

Go easy on him.
I think he had a pretty rough night.

-[Choi laughs]
-[woozily] How can I be of help?

581
00:46:00,841 --> 00:46:03,886
[Choi] Can you please lock up the officer
