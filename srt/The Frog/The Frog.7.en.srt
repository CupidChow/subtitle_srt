It's all my fault.

00:00:35,660 --> 00:00:37,162
[sobs] It's because of me.

[Seong-a chuckles] I had time to spare.

20
00:01:53,404 --> 00:01:56,407
[woman 1] I didn't think you'd come.
I was going to tell you…

[stirring music playing]

00:02:30,692 --> 00:02:32,360

Mm… sure, sounds good.

24
00:02:37,615 --> 00:02:39,826
Su-a, why don't you go
and get us two cups of coffee?

Sure.

Ah!

30
00:02:53,756 --> 00:02:55,216
Thought I might try it too.

Yeah?

34
00:03:13,484 --> 00:03:14,903
[man 1] I told her to do it.

35
00:03:15,862 --> 00:03:16,738
What?

36
00:03:16,821 --> 00:03:19,574
Why are you trying
to exhibit those horrid paintings?

37
00:03:20,533 --> 00:03:21,367
Horrid?

38
00:03:21,451 --> 00:03:22,744
People will buy them for my sake,

39
00:03:22,827 --> 00:03:25,663
but you should've painted something
actually worth displaying.

Looks like you enjoyed prison.

You're looking good.

51
00:05:20,903 --> 00:05:21,988
Thanks to you.

52
00:05:27,201 --> 00:05:28,786
Sorry I didn't invite you.

53
00:05:29,537 --> 00:05:30,997
It must've been hard to find.

54
00:05:32,415 --> 00:05:35,126
Thought you wanted me here
because you sent these.

55
00:06:00,151 --> 00:06:01,819
You should go take a look, then.

56
00:06:03,071 --> 00:06:05,323
I thought of your dead kid
when I made them.

I'm not a domestic abuser.

76
00:07:11,806 --> 00:07:12,807
Why'd you do it?

77
00:07:15,101 --> 00:07:17,353
If you hated me,
then you should've killed me.

78
00:07:18,563 --> 00:07:21,232
Why? Why take it out on Si-hyeon?

79
00:07:24,277 --> 00:07:26,529
What kind of mother would kill her child?

81

Please.

84
00:07:33,202 --> 00:07:34,787
Tell me, please.

85
00:07:40,710 --> 00:07:41,919
I never hated you.

86
00:07:42,753 --> 00:07:44,380
Si-hyeon's the one I hated.

87
00:07:50,595 --> 00:07:51,596
What did Si-hyeon ever do?

88
00:07:51,679 --> 00:07:52,722
I don't know.

89
00:07:54,265 --> 00:07:56,893
Seeing him every morning
was causing a lot of stress.

90
00:07:56,976 --> 00:07:58,603
Then you should've talked to me about it.

91
00:07:58,686 --> 00:08:00,771
All he wanted was for me
to be out of your lives.

92
00:08:01,564 --> 00:08:02,523
Si-hyeon…

93
00:08:05,735 --> 00:08:07,153
loved you more than anyone.

94
00:08:08,905 --> 00:08:10,573
He did ask me before

95
00:08:11,699 --> 00:08:12,992
if I was his mother.

96
00:08:14,577 --> 00:08:15,620
Why didn't you tell him

97
00:08:15,703 --> 00:08:17,997
that his mom left
when she gave birth to him?

98
00:08:19,123 --> 00:08:20,583
How could I say that to a child?

99
00:08:20,666 --> 00:08:21,626
[Seong-a scoffs]

100
00:08:25,087 --> 00:08:27,423
You wanted him to think that I was.

101
00:08:28,049 --> 00:08:28,966
And then

102
00:08:29,967 --> 00:08:32,929
I had to act like I loved that kid
because I chose you.

103
00:08:36,641 --> 00:08:37,975
Could it be that

104
00:08:39,310 --> 00:08:41,395
you were trying to find a mother for him?

105
00:08:42,939 --> 00:08:44,732
Would you still have married me

106
00:08:46,234 --> 00:08:48,027
if you didn't have a child?

107
00:08:50,780 --> 00:08:53,199
How else could I confirm
my suspicions about it all?

108
00:08:56,744 --> 00:08:57,703
Do you get it?

109
00:08:59,664 --> 00:09:02,542
Don't ask questions

00:18:00,370 --> 00:18:02,331
I, uh, I am up at the rental,

187
00:18:02,414 --> 00:18:04,166
but your dad's not here.

188
00:18:07,377 --> 00:18:08,504
Dad isn't there?

189
00:18:09,046 --> 00:18:10,464
I'm sure he'll be back soon.

190
00:18:11,799 --> 00:18:13,092
Talk to you later, kiddo.

191
00:18:13,634 --> 00:18:14,551
Bye.

192
00:18:16,386 --> 00:18:17,471
[disconnect tone]

193
00:18:19,515 --> 00:18:20,474
DAD

194
00:18:21,183 --> 00:18:22,434
[phone line ringing]

195
00:18:34,488 --> 00:18:35,447
[disconnect tone]

196
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:37,366
[Ui-seon] Hi, welcome!

197
00:18:37,449 --> 00:18:39,868
[slurping]

198
00:18:42,329 --> 00:18:43,872
[slurping]

199
00:18:45,415 --> 00:18:48,627
[Yeong-ha] How do I deal
with an obnoxious guest?

200
00:18:50,295 --> 00:18:51,296
Is this the guest?

201
00:18:53,090 --> 00:18:54,174
You don't want any?

202
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:56,176
[Yong-chae] I already ate.

203
00:18:56,718 --> 00:19:00,222
You're wolfing that down,
seeing the jjamppong wasn't yours.

204
00:19:01,849 --> 00:19:03,100
It worked out well.

205
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:05,727
It would've become mushy anyways.

206
00:19:09,565 --> 00:19:10,941
How long have you stayed here?

207
00:19:12,192 --> 00:19:13,318
It's been a month.

208
00:19:14,111 --> 00:19:16,238
The walls outside look very pretty.

209
00:19:16,738 --> 00:19:17,781
Did you paint those too?

210
00:19:18,782 --> 00:19:20,117
They were too dull.

211
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:21,493
Great colors though, hmm?

212
00:19:21,577 --> 00:19:24,121
The redecorating is
because of you. [laughs]

213
00:19:24,204 --> 00:19:27,749
Actually, the owner here
is gonna sell me his rental.

214
00:19:27,833 --> 00:19:28,834
Really, now?

215
00:19:29,418 --> 00:19:31,003
-Yeah.
-[chuckles]

216
00:19:31,086 --> 00:19:32,921
The owner's selling it to you?

217
00:19:33,005 --> 00:19:34,173
His rental?

218
00:19:35,674 --> 00:19:36,592
Yeah.

219
00:19:45,058 --> 00:19:46,685
I'll give you back your remaining fee.

220
00:19:46,768 --> 00:19:50,647
You must leave tomorrow,
or else I'm gonna have to call the police.

221
00:19:50,731 --> 00:19:54,568
Then I'll sue you and make sure
you pay every last penny in damages

222
00:19:54,651 --> 00:19:56,445
for what you've done to this place.

223
00:19:56,528 --> 00:19:57,779
And who are you?

224
00:19:57,863 --> 00:19:59,448
An expert in this.

225
00:20:00,324 --> 00:20:01,325
In what?

226
00:20:01,408 --> 00:20:03,076
An expert in liars.

227
00:20:13,086 --> 00:20:14,171
[grunts]

228
00:20:21,762 --> 00:20:22,638
[sighs]

229
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:26,600
How long has he been dealing with that?

230
00:20:29,770 --> 00:20:31,480
[footsteps approaching]

231
00:20:32,356 --> 00:20:33,565
Wait a minute.

232
00:20:34,983 --> 00:20:36,818
I'M AT YOUR PLACE.
IS THAT THE WOMAN WHO…

233
00:20:36,902 --> 00:20:37,778
[Seong-a] Hey, you!

234
00:20:38,403 --> 00:20:40,405
[unsettling music playing]

235
00:20:42,449 --> 00:20:43,867
"Hey, you"?

236
00:20:51,208 --> 00:20:52,793
When he comes back here,

237
00:20:53,710 --> 00:20:55,796
you can ask him if I was lying.

238
00:20:57,172 --> 00:20:58,715
I already know the answer.

239
00:20:58,799 --> 00:21:00,467
He won't sell this place.

240
00:21:00,550 --> 00:21:02,636
That man won't give it up.

241
00:21:02,719 --> 00:21:05,430
He wants to die in this place,
not sell to you.

242
00:21:07,724 --> 00:21:10,102
Then I'm not the liar here. He is.

243
00:21:12,521 --> 00:21:13,730
[sighs]

244
00:21:13,814 --> 00:21:15,524
Ugh, for God's sake.

245
00:21:22,030 --> 00:21:23,156
Say sorry.

246
00:21:25,659 --> 00:21:26,827
[grunts]

247
00:21:29,830 --> 00:21:32,457
[Yong-chae] Your parents
clearly raised you poorly.

248
00:21:32,541 --> 00:21:34,459
I'd have beaten some manners into you.

249
00:21:40,549 --> 00:21:41,383
[Seong-a] Hey.

250
00:21:42,009 --> 00:21:42,926
Hey!

251
00:21:43,802 --> 00:21:45,721
What the hell?

252
00:21:46,430 --> 00:21:47,639
-[Seong-a] Die.
-Get off!

253
00:21:47,723 --> 00:21:48,682
[Seong-a] Die!

[Yong-chae coughs]

258
00:22:06,742 --> 00:22:08,243
[Seong-a] Look at you.

259
00:22:08,327 --> 00:22:10,871
Why are you so nosey? Hmm?

260
00:22:16,501 --> 00:22:17,878
Oh shit.

I have something to report.

290
00:26:09,025 --> 00:26:10,610
[Yong-chae] Your dad has been injured.

291
00:26:10,694 --> 00:26:12,946
He told me not to tell you.
He didn't want you to worry.

292
00:26:13,029 --> 00:26:14,281
He's at the rental.

293

[Seong-a] You don't remember me?

315
00:28:40,385 --> 00:28:43,304
Your dad met your in-laws
for the first time.

316
00:28:43,388 --> 00:28:44,889
Wine…

317
00:28:44,973 --> 00:28:47,225

[Seong-a] The thing is,
I can't seem to get a hold of him.

320
00:28:53,481 --> 00:28:56,776
We need to discuss something
before I check out,

321
00:28:56,860 --> 00:28:58,611
but he won't answer the phone.

[uneasy music playing]

326
00:29:22,761 --> 00:29:23,595
What?

327
00:29:24,345 --> 00:29:25,847
Did he go and die in a ditch?

[Seong-a chuckles]

329
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:41,946

Ow! Okay, I'll tell you!

331

[exhales] Shit!

333
00:29:49,329 --> 00:29:50,914
How are you so strong?

334
00:29:52,791 --> 00:29:54,793
Oh God, I'm tired.

335
00:29:56,586 --> 00:30:00,048
You see, your dad and I are accomplices.

336
00:30:00,548 --> 00:30:01,591
Meaning?

337
00:30:01,674 --> 00:30:04,427
Well, your dad and I
killed a kid in this house.

338
00:30:04,511 --> 00:30:06,846
My ex-husband's son.
I put a pill in his food.

339
00:30:06,930 --> 00:30:09,516
He fell asleep,
and I strangled him to death.

340
00:30:09,599 --> 00:30:10,850
That bathroom over there?

341
00:30:10,934 --> 00:30:13,603
I put some plastic down
and dismembered the body.

I'm so sick of it all. Seriously. Shit.

343
00:30:17,482 --> 00:30:20,193
Anyway, your dad was a really big help.

344
00:30:20,276 --> 00:30:22,195
You know, he cleaned up afterwards.

345
00:30:26,157 --> 00:30:26,991
My dad did what?

346
00:30:28,618 --> 00:30:31,830
What do you think would happen
if people knew a kid was killed here?

347
00:30:32,664 --> 00:30:35,959
Your dad and I have things to discuss,
so keep calling him.

348
00:30:36,042 --> 00:30:38,628
And you can let him know
that you're here with me.

349
00:30:38,711 --> 00:30:40,880
That'll make him
get his ass over here. Jeez.

Hey, you know what?

357
00:31:05,613 --> 00:31:07,907
-You should try medication, okay?
-[chuckles]

358
00:31:07,991 --> 00:31:09,367
Would you like a psychiatrist?

359
00:31:11,619 --> 00:31:13,037
No, thanks. That's okay.

[Seong-a] But aren't you

370

that she arrived at the rental.

437

Have you not seen her?

438

[Seong-a] Is that a real gun?

Where is she?

447
00:38:21,924 --> 00:38:24,218
[Seong-a] Shoot something. This bottle.

448
00:38:24,302 --> 00:38:25,303
Tell me now!

449
00:38:30,099 --> 00:38:31,434
[Seong-a] Lower your gun.

450
00:38:36,897 --> 00:38:38,816
I'll kill you and find her myself.

451
00:38:38,899 --> 00:38:40,359
[Seong-a] You won't find her.

452
00:38:40,860 --> 00:38:43,362
If you want her alive,
you better listen close.

453
00:38:45,031 --> 00:38:46,240
Then you might see her again.

454
00:38:49,327 --> 00:38:50,703
I'm serious.

You know,

459
00:39:09,805 --> 00:39:11,766
I didn't wanna do this either.

[moans]

461
00:39:14,310 --> 00:39:18,856
But everybody's been stabbing me
in the back the last few days.

462
00:39:19,482 --> 00:39:21,192
And come to think of it,

463
00:39:21,275 --> 00:39:24,195
you also lied to me
about selling me the rental.

464
00:39:26,614 --> 00:39:27,948
And now you…

465
00:39:28,532 --> 00:39:30,284
A gun? You're holding a gun?

466
00:39:30,368 --> 00:39:31,911
I promise I didn't lie.

467
00:39:32,912 --> 00:39:34,330
I planned to sell to you.

468
00:39:35,915 --> 00:39:37,833
That all changed when you went insane.

469
00:39:40,002 --> 00:39:41,712
My exhibit was a success.

470
00:39:42,213 --> 00:39:43,381
[chuckles]

471
00:39:44,673 --> 00:39:46,300
In this rental,

472
00:39:47,551 --> 00:39:49,261
I create amazing work.

473
00:39:52,556 --> 00:39:54,392
And the works I've made here,

474
00:39:56,227 --> 00:40:00,147
they're so amazing that I think
I'll throw out all my pieces from before.

475
00:40:00,815 --> 00:40:03,275
They could never compare
to what I did here.

476
00:40:04,276 --> 00:40:05,861
But you know what happened?

477
00:40:11,575 --> 00:40:12,827
This is the result.

478
00:40:15,746 --> 00:40:17,832
If I show them the truth,
no one believes it.

[Seong-a laughs]

480
00:40:27,967 --> 00:40:29,760
You doubt me, don't you?

481
00:40:30,428 --> 00:40:33,514
You don't believe
I'd really kill your daughter, do you?

[Seong-a laughs, sighs]

486
00:40:41,689 --> 00:40:44,108
I took that as you saying,

487
00:40:44,775 --> 00:40:47,111
"I won't hesitate to shoot you,

488
00:40:49,029 --> 00:40:52,700
but I'm still open… to talk it out

489
00:40:53,617 --> 00:40:55,411
and make a deal with you."

[sighs]

491
00:41:03,544 --> 00:41:05,129
The basement's a good start.

492
00:41:05,754 --> 00:41:07,381
I'll give you 30 minutes.

493
00:41:08,132 --> 00:41:09,884
Let's talk after you save your friend.

Hey, wh… what's going on?

What happened to Yong-chae?

506
00:42:00,643 --> 00:42:02,728
Stay here until his family gets here.

507
00:42:14,532 --> 00:42:15,824
[Gyeong-nam] Oh, what?

508
00:42:15,908 --> 00:42:17,076

What happened to him?

512
00:42:25,459 --> 00:42:27,211
That's not a simple injury.

513

00:42:28,921 --> 00:42:30,089
Who did that to him?

515
00:42:30,756 --> 00:42:31,715
Let go.

[Gyeong-nam] I won't!

517
00:42:34,969 --> 00:42:36,178
Did you do that to him?

518
00:42:38,180 --> 00:42:39,598
Hey, stop trying to walk away!

Hey, wait a minute.

521

You hurt a friend
who just got out of the hospital.

522

Get out here.
I'm going to call the police right now!

00:46:07,931 --> 00:46:10,309
[suspenseful music playing]

554
00:46:39,463 --> 00:46:41,465
[loud banging]

555
00:46:41,548 --> 00:46:43,550
[unsettling music playing]

556
00:46:46,386 --> 00:46:47,304
[loud bang]

557
00:46:53,811 --> 00:46:54,853
[banging continues]

558
00:46:55,854 --> 00:46:56,772
[music fades]

559
00:46:57,523 --> 00:46:59,066
[dramatic music playing]

560
00:47:02,653 --> 00:47:03,987
[glass shattering]

561
00:47:08,659 --> 00:47:10,452
[tense music playing]

562
00:47:10,536 --> 00:47:11,995
[Seong-a] You're unbelievable.

563
00:47:12,746 --> 00:47:14,206
Are you mad because of your friend?

564
00:47:14,289 --> 00:47:16,083
That fucker was asking for it.

565
00:47:16,166 --> 00:47:17,835
I've learned something recently.

566
00:47:19,211 --> 00:47:20,462
Why are you so serious?

567
00:47:20,546 --> 00:47:24,758
I've seen… blatantly… with my own eyes,

568
00:47:26,134 --> 00:47:29,346
how putting something off,
avoiding it, or hiding it

569
00:47:30,013 --> 00:47:32,099
leads to a lot of horrible things.

570
00:47:34,268 --> 00:47:37,229
How attempting
to not get blood on my hands

571
00:47:37,312 --> 00:47:39,731
only results in loved ones getting hurt.

572
00:47:40,274 --> 00:47:42,860
-Now it's time to end all of this.
-Once we work out a deal.

573
00:47:42,943 --> 00:47:44,319
[music fades]

574
00:47:47,239 --> 00:47:48,073
Then I'll leave.

575
00:47:52,911 --> 00:47:54,162
The exhibit's over.

576
00:47:57,624 --> 00:47:58,667
Tomorrow, I fly out.

577
00:47:58,750 --> 00:48:00,627
Do you really think you can run away

578
00:48:01,753 --> 00:48:03,338
after what you've done here?

579
00:48:04,923 --> 00:48:08,135
I promise that you'll be able
to find her safe and sound.

580
00:48:08,218 --> 00:48:09,261
As for your friend,

581
00:48:09,344 --> 00:48:12,556
well, he got banged up pretty bad,
but he'll be okay.

582
00:48:14,141 --> 00:48:15,809
And you can live here again safely.

583
00:48:18,520 --> 00:48:20,856
Like none of this had ever happened.

584
00:48:23,191 --> 00:48:24,651
I'm never coming back.

585
00:48:27,237 --> 00:48:28,614
It'll all be behind you.

586
00:48:34,786 --> 00:48:36,914
If you mess it up
right when it counts, however,

587
00:48:38,040 --> 00:48:41,084
then I'll make sure I'll see this
whole thing through with you…

588
00:48:41,168 --> 00:48:42,377
[uneasy music playing]

589
00:48:42,461 --> 00:48:44,588
…and I'll make your life a living hell.

590
00:48:46,381 --> 00:48:47,758
And it will end

591
00:48:49,176 --> 00:48:51,595
with you watching helplessly
as your daughter dies.

592
00:49:03,607 --> 00:49:04,775
The clock's ticking.

593
00:49:10,238 --> 00:49:11,448
[phone buzzing]

594
00:49:21,792 --> 00:49:22,918
Who's that?

595
00:49:23,001 --> 00:49:24,544
CAPTAIN YOON BO-MIN

596
00:49:24,628 --> 00:49:25,671
The police.

597
00:49:27,965 --> 00:49:30,550
You didn't see this coming
after what you did to Yong-chae?

598
00:49:32,594 --> 00:49:35,764
Once the doctors are done
and Yong-chae wakes up,

599
00:49:36,390 --> 00:49:38,809
he'll immediately tell them
everything you did.

600
00:49:40,727 --> 00:49:42,396
The clock's only ticking for you.

601
00:49:43,563 --> 00:49:44,815
[phone continues buzzing]

602
00:49:58,787 --> 00:50:00,789
[music intensifies]

603
00:50:06,336 --> 00:50:08,005
-[sighs]
-[music fades]

604
00:50:11,717 --> 00:50:12,884
What are your demands?

605
00:50:15,345 --> 00:50:17,097
Oh, this has been a long day.

606
00:50:19,266 --> 00:50:20,267
I need some water.

607
00:50:38,076 --> 00:50:39,077
[Seong-a sighs]

608
00:50:39,161 --> 00:50:40,370
Put the weapon down.

609
00:50:48,420 --> 00:50:50,213
You're gonna tell your friend
and your daughter

610
00:50:50,297 --> 00:50:51,631
to keep their mouths closed.

611
00:50:52,549 --> 00:50:55,052
I'm sure I don't need
to explain why to you.

612
00:50:58,847 --> 00:50:59,931
[Yeong-ha] What else?

613
00:51:00,515 --> 00:51:04,436
[Seong-a] Someone might come here
looking for me. He's a total psycho.

614
00:51:05,937 --> 00:51:09,149
He'll probably end up being
three times the headache I was for you,

615
00:51:09,649 --> 00:51:11,109
though he's not as much fun.

616
00:51:11,693 --> 00:51:12,611
[Seong-a chuckles]

617
00:51:13,195 --> 00:51:16,490
Tell him I was never here,
and that you've never heard of me.

618
00:51:17,949 --> 00:51:21,703
And so, the last part, you…

619
00:51:25,665 --> 00:51:27,417
will help me bury something here.

620
00:51:29,628 --> 00:51:31,171
The vegetable garden, ideally.

621
00:51:31,755 --> 00:51:33,090
What did you do this time?

622
00:51:34,633 --> 00:51:36,343
Better you don't know, right?

623
00:51:37,344 --> 00:51:38,512
Just like a year ago.

624
00:51:51,274 --> 00:51:52,234
[Yeong-ha] Fine.

625
00:51:52,317 --> 00:51:54,319
[pensive music playing]

626
00:51:54,402 --> 00:51:56,363
But first, I need to see my daughter.

627
00:51:59,449 --> 00:52:00,575
Don't bullshit me.

628
00:52:00,659 --> 00:52:03,370
My daughter and Yong-chae
will do whatever I tell them.

629
00:52:04,663 --> 00:52:06,206
And saying I don't know you,

630
00:52:07,040 --> 00:52:09,292
well, I have no problem with that at all.

631
00:52:10,001 --> 00:52:11,336
I'd rather that, actually.

632
00:52:13,255 --> 00:52:14,422
[phone buzzing]

633
00:52:23,807 --> 00:52:24,724
CAPTAIN YOON BO-MIN

634
00:52:26,601 --> 00:52:28,478
Now it's your turn to choose.

635
00:52:29,271 --> 00:52:31,731
We either save my daughter
and bury what you need,

636
00:52:32,774 --> 00:52:35,068
or we see this through to the very end.

637
00:52:41,658 --> 00:52:44,286
You better keep your promise,
or I'll really lose it.

638
00:52:44,369 --> 00:52:45,662
Get in the car.

639
00:52:55,463 --> 00:52:56,715
[engine starting]

640
00:53:20,405 --> 00:53:21,489
[engine stops]

641
00:53:38,173 --> 00:53:40,175
[unsettling music playing]

642
00:53:46,014 --> 00:53:47,682
How long has she been like this?

643
00:53:53,313 --> 00:53:55,148
Well, better get her out of there.

644
00:53:59,569 --> 00:54:01,029
[Seong-a grunts, groans]

645
00:54:07,202 --> 00:54:08,119
You're gonna do it.

646
00:54:12,791 --> 00:54:14,876
[tense music playing]

647
00:54:24,219 --> 00:54:26,221
[music intensifies]

648
00:54:32,060 --> 00:54:32,936
[grunts]

649
00:54:45,782 --> 00:54:47,450
[grunts, groans]

650
00:54:47,534 --> 00:54:48,868
[Bo-min] Miss Yoo Seong-a.

651
00:54:53,331 --> 00:54:55,250
-[Seong-a] Ah.
-[Bo-min] Going somewhere again?

652
00:54:55,333 --> 00:54:57,627
[tense music continues]

653
00:55:05,844 --> 00:55:07,429
[Seong-a breathing heavily]

654
00:55:12,767 --> 00:55:15,562
What… what is happening?

655
00:55:18,481 --> 00:55:20,525
[Gyeong-nam] Ah, yes,
I have something to report.

656
00:55:20,608 --> 00:55:22,694
I'm not sure
if it's worth filing a report.

657
00:55:22,777 --> 00:55:26,364
I wasn't comfortable
letting something like this slide,

658
00:55:26,448 --> 00:55:29,492
which is why I thought
I'd just give you a call, Captain.

659
00:55:29,576 --> 00:55:32,787
Yes, but Yeong-ha isn't the kind of person
who'd do something like that.

660
00:55:32,871 --> 00:55:34,789
Attacking me, sure, but Yong-chae?
He'd never--

661
00:55:34,873 --> 00:55:36,958
-What was he stabbed with?
-A screwdriver.

662
00:55:37,042 --> 00:55:38,585
[tense music continues]

663
00:56:03,735 --> 00:56:05,737
[pensive music playing]

664
00:56:08,490 --> 00:56:09,824
Tell me all about her.

665
00:56:11,159 --> 00:56:13,286
First, she picked a fight
with your guests,

666
00:56:14,204 --> 00:56:15,997
then the incident with Officer Kim.

667
00:56:17,499 --> 00:56:19,292
And she brought the police out.

668
00:56:19,376 --> 00:56:21,878
They came to your rental
twice in a few days.

669
00:56:22,712 --> 00:56:24,506
The one who, unlike you,

670
00:56:24,589 --> 00:56:27,008
can't control her anger
except through violence.

671
00:56:29,302 --> 00:56:30,470
Yoo Seong-a.

672
00:56:34,182 --> 00:56:36,601
You need to tell me what's going on
with her right this minute.

673
00:56:40,188 --> 00:56:41,773
She kidnapped my daughter.

674
00:56:44,526 --> 00:56:45,527
I don't know where she--

675
00:56:46,277 --> 00:56:48,405
Do what she tells you
to make sure your daughter's safe.

676
00:56:48,488 --> 00:56:49,823
Once I do that,

677
00:56:50,865 --> 00:56:52,117
this woman will run away.

678
00:56:52,200 --> 00:56:54,494
Yeong-ha, first we find your daughter.

679
00:56:55,703 --> 00:56:57,414
-We'll take care of her later.
-No.

680
00:56:59,499 --> 00:57:01,084
If you don't catch her tonight,

681
00:57:02,836 --> 00:57:04,754
I just might kill her myself.

682
00:57:11,261 --> 00:57:14,097
You have my word, sir.
We'll get her tonight.

683
00:57:15,306 --> 00:57:18,643
That being said, you need to buy us
as much time as possible at the rental

684
00:57:18,726 --> 00:57:20,728
while we search for your daughter.

685
00:57:20,812 --> 00:57:22,313
Then I will call you.

686
00:57:22,397 --> 00:57:24,691
If I end it right away,
that means the search proved futile.

687
00:57:24,774 --> 00:57:27,694
If it keeps ringing,
it means we found her, so ignore the call.

688
00:57:27,777 --> 00:57:30,738
[phone buzzing]

689
00:57:35,994 --> 00:57:36,953
[sighs]

690
00:57:37,704 --> 00:57:38,955
[phone continues buzzing]

691
00:57:40,498 --> 00:57:41,583
[dramatic music playing]

692
00:57:41,666 --> 00:57:42,709
CAPTAIN YOON BO-MIN

693
00:57:46,004 --> 00:57:48,590
[Bo-min] Keep tracking her and call me.
I'll head there first.

694
00:57:48,673 --> 00:57:49,632
[man] Yes, Captain.

695
00:57:50,508 --> 00:57:52,510
[dramatic music continues]

696
00:58:00,643 --> 00:58:02,854
[Bo-min] Once I call
after rescuing your daughter,

697
00:58:02,937 --> 00:58:05,440
lure Yoo Seong-a
to the scene of the crime.

698
00:58:06,733 --> 00:58:09,152
The only way we'll catch her red-handed

699
00:58:10,570 --> 00:58:13,490
is if she shows up at the scene
of her own volition.

700
00:58:14,240 --> 00:58:15,700
[music subsides]

701
00:58:26,628 --> 00:58:29,589
[Bo-min] Why don't you go to the hospital?
Go be with your daughter.

702
00:58:31,007 --> 00:58:32,509
Please escort Mr. Jeon.

703
00:58:32,592 --> 00:58:34,385
-[officer 1] Yes, Captain.
-Go on.

704
00:58:34,969 --> 00:58:37,680
Where are you going? Where are you going?!

705
00:58:37,764 --> 00:58:39,766
[dramatic music playing]

706
00:58:39,849 --> 00:58:41,226
Let go! Let go! I said let go!

707
00:58:41,309 --> 00:58:42,685
-[officer 1] Grab her!
-Let go!

708
00:58:42,769 --> 00:58:43,811
Come here!

709
00:58:43,895 --> 00:58:45,146
Can't you see I'm hurt?

710
00:58:45,230 --> 00:58:47,398
He assaulted me. I'm the victim here!

711
00:58:47,482 --> 00:58:48,816
[screaming]

712
00:58:48,900 --> 00:58:50,276
Hey, stay still!

713
00:58:50,360 --> 00:58:52,195
[Seong-a panting]

714
00:58:53,279 --> 00:58:54,656
Let go! Let go!

715
00:58:54,739 --> 00:58:57,075
You're under arrest
for assault and kidnapping.

716
00:58:57,158 --> 00:58:58,076
[Seong-a] Shit!

717
00:58:58,826 --> 00:59:00,537
You have the right to an attorney.

718
00:59:01,329 --> 00:59:02,789
You can defend yourself,

719
00:59:03,831 --> 00:59:05,792
and you can refuse to make a statement.

720
00:59:06,960 --> 00:59:09,546
You have the right to petition
for a writ of habeas corpus.

721
00:59:09,629 --> 00:59:11,464
[breathing heavily]

722
00:59:13,800 --> 00:59:15,760
[screaming]

723
00:59:16,344 --> 00:59:18,888
Let go! Let go! Let go!

724
00:59:18,972 --> 00:59:20,515
[music fades]

725
00:59:20,598 --> 00:59:21,641
[car door opens]

726
00:59:22,725 --> 00:59:23,685
[car door closes]

727
00:59:28,856 --> 00:59:29,774
Ui-seon.

728
00:59:31,985 --> 00:59:33,987
[distant siren wailing]

729
00:59:42,412 --> 00:59:43,496
[Gyeong-nam] Oh, hey.

730
00:59:49,961 --> 00:59:50,837
[Yeong-ha] Jeon.

731
00:59:51,754 --> 00:59:53,715
-Jeon Ui-seon.
-Are you her parent, sir?

732
00:59:53,798 --> 00:59:55,800
-Yes.
-[nurse 1] She needs emergency surgery.

733
00:59:55,883 --> 00:59:58,886
Her blood pressure is dropping
from the internal bleeding in her abdomen.

734
00:59:59,387 --> 01:00:01,306
Please fill out this consent form.

735
01:00:01,931 --> 01:00:05,268
We may need to abort the baby
in order to save the mother's life.

736
01:00:05,351 --> 01:00:06,436
You'll abort?

737
01:00:08,104 --> 01:00:09,814
-Her child?
-[nurse 1] Yes.

738
01:00:26,914 --> 01:00:27,999
Ui-seon.

739
01:00:28,082 --> 01:00:30,084
[melancholy music playing]

740
01:00:31,544 --> 01:00:32,587
Darling.

741
01:00:35,632 --> 01:00:36,966
[nurse 2] Please wait here, sir.

742
01:00:57,403 --> 01:00:58,613
It's all my fault.

743
01:01:02,784 --> 01:01:03,785
[sobs]

744
01:01:03,868 --> 01:01:04,952
It's because of me.

745
01:01:07,747 --> 01:01:09,874
[crying]

746
01:01:10,750 --> 01:01:14,420
-It's okay. She's in good hands.
-It's all my fault. [sobs] It's all…

747
01:01:15,672 --> 01:01:18,132
[crying]

748
01:01:19,592 --> 01:01:21,386
I made that happen to her.

749
01:01:23,012 --> 01:01:24,347
[Gyeong-nam] It'll all be okay.

750
01:01:32,063 --> 01:01:34,065
[sirens wailing]

751
01:01:38,861 --> 01:01:40,029
[sirens stop]

752
01:01:43,324 --> 01:01:44,283
[detective] Get out.

753
01:01:57,463 --> 01:01:58,423
[sniffles]

754
01:02:00,633 --> 01:02:02,427
[footsteps approaching]

755
01:02:11,519 --> 01:02:12,729
[Bo-min] Are you all right?

756
01:02:16,524 --> 01:02:17,525
Today…

757
01:02:19,527 --> 01:02:21,195
what happened is my fault.

758
01:02:24,240 --> 01:02:26,159
Innocent people and my daughter…

759
01:02:29,912 --> 01:02:31,414
got hurt in all this…

760
01:02:33,958 --> 01:02:35,001
because of what I did.

761
01:02:37,754 --> 01:02:38,796
The frog.

762
01:02:42,008 --> 01:02:43,259
Someone once told me

763
01:02:44,510 --> 01:02:46,679
if you get caught up in something bad,

764
01:02:48,556 --> 01:02:50,767
you'll always blame yourself and think,

765
01:02:51,476 --> 01:02:53,186
"Why was I hit by this stone?"

766
01:02:55,313 --> 01:02:56,731
Like the frog in the story.

767
01:02:58,232 --> 01:03:00,234
[wistful music playing]

768
01:03:02,528 --> 01:03:05,114
Mr. Jeon Yeong-ha, you're the victim here.

769
01:03:06,407 --> 01:03:08,159
You might be thinking things like,

770
01:03:09,869 --> 01:03:12,079
"Why couldn't I have
done something earlier?"

771
01:03:14,457 --> 01:03:16,125
But you did the best you could.

772
01:03:17,585 --> 01:03:19,337
As any regular person could.

773
01:03:19,921 --> 01:03:21,464
[sobs]

774
01:03:26,302 --> 01:03:27,678
Take your time, okay?

775
01:03:29,472 --> 01:03:31,557
Stay with your daughter as she recovers,

776
01:03:33,059 --> 01:03:35,061
and then help us with the investigation.

777
01:03:41,400 --> 01:03:43,694
[breathes deeply]

778
01:03:43,778 --> 01:03:45,780
[wistful music continues]

779
01:04:08,010 --> 01:04:10,012
[pensive music playing]

780
01:04:17,728 --> 01:04:19,939
She was gonna bury something
at the property.

781
01:04:21,399 --> 01:04:22,400
I think she…

782
01:04:24,402 --> 01:04:25,820
I think she killed somebody.

783
01:04:25,903 --> 01:04:27,905
[unsettling music playing]

784
01:04:53,472 --> 01:04:55,474
[unsettling music continues]

785
01:05:00,605 --> 01:05:01,606
[door opens]

786
01:05:17,496 --> 01:05:19,498
[tense music playing]

787
01:05:26,213 --> 01:05:28,132
[dramatic music playing]

788
01:06:17,264 --> 01:06:19,183
[music fades]
