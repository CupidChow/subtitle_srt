[Sang-jun] If a tree falls in a forest…

and no one is around to hear it…

00:01:25,210 --> 00:01:26,586
…does it make a sound?

8
00:01:27,295 --> 00:01:28,713
Or is there nothing…

9
00:01:33,635 --> 00:01:34,761
but silence?

00:01:49,359 --> 00:01:50,735
[Sang-jun] Let's go inside.

14
00:01:51,444 --> 00:01:52,362
Yeah?

15
00:01:53,029 --> 00:01:54,989
Come on! Let's just take one look.

16
00:01:57,158 --> 00:01:58,535
Oh, come on, please?

17
00:01:58,618 --> 00:02:01,621
-Just one look. Please? Ow!

Honey, check this out.

Yeah?

Come on, come on,
come on, come on, come on!

24
00:02:21,391 --> 00:02:24,686
[sighs] It's up for auction right now.
It's so nice.

25
00:02:24,769 --> 00:02:27,981
You saw that lake, right?
There's a great view of it here.

26
00:02:28,731 --> 00:02:29,941
This way. Yeah.

Over here, guys! Hurry!

29
00:02:35,572 --> 00:02:39,701
Oh wow. Just look at that.
The view's crazy, huh?

30
00:02:40,243 --> 00:02:43,246
They're gonna start doing
a flower festival next year. Look at this.

31
00:02:43,329 --> 00:02:46,749
They've already started planting
all around the lake. See?

32
00:02:46,833 --> 00:02:49,711
I mean, if you don't trust me,
then just run it by your sister.

33
00:02:49,794 --> 00:02:50,670
She'll vouch for it.

34
00:02:51,421 --> 00:02:52,547
All right. Jeez, I get it.

35
00:02:52,630 --> 00:02:55,258
Wait. Maybe you already did?

36
00:02:56,885 --> 00:02:57,719
Really?

37
00:02:58,386 --> 00:02:59,888
[laughing]

38
00:03:01,890 --> 00:03:04,017

What do you think?

[Sang-jun laughing]

40
00:03:06,144 --> 00:03:07,145
Isn't this awesome?

-[all laughing]
-[Sang-jun] Yeah!

42
00:03:09,147 --> 00:03:12,817
[Eun-gyeong] I think…
I've always been lacking in some way.

[emotional music playing]

44
00:03:14,527 --> 00:03:16,654
I'm sorry for taking the easy way out,

45
00:03:17,197 --> 00:03:20,909
even though I know how much
both you and Gi-ho are struggling.

46
00:03:22,827 --> 00:03:25,413
I just can't get the image of the woman

47
00:03:26,372 --> 00:03:28,166
who died here out of my head.

48
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:31,753
And I'm willing to do whatever it takes

49
00:03:32,754 --> 00:03:34,214
to not see her anymore.

50
00:03:35,798 --> 00:03:36,799
[sobs]

51
00:03:37,550 --> 00:03:39,385
I'm such a drama queen, aren't I?

52
00:03:42,222 --> 00:03:43,181
I just

53
00:03:44,057 --> 00:03:45,683
need to be at peace.

54
00:03:46,517 --> 00:03:48,102
I hope you can understand that.

55
00:03:49,562 --> 00:03:51,314
I'm sorry, Sang-jun.

56
00:03:53,358 --> 00:03:54,859
And please tell Gi-ho…

[sniffles]

58
00:04:16,506 --> 00:04:18,466

60
00:04:23,930 --> 00:04:25,598
[young Bo-min] Mr. Ji Hyang-cheol,

00:04:26,099 --> 00:04:28,309
my name is Yoon Bo-min
from the Dongho Police.

62
00:04:30,186 --> 00:04:32,188
-I wanted to ask you if--
-So who's this?

63
00:04:40,905 --> 00:04:42,907
JOONGMIN DAILY

[handcuffs rattle]

65
00:04:48,997 --> 00:04:50,206
You're not a journalist.

66
00:04:51,165 --> 00:04:53,710
-[young Bo-min] Wait a moment.
-[Sang-jun] You should remember me.

67
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:57,630
You, of all people, should.

68
00:05:02,343 --> 00:05:03,553
You're the reason I'm…

69
00:05:03,636 --> 00:05:05,221
[Hyang-cheol] You're very nice.

70
00:05:05,305 --> 00:05:07,307
[mysterious music playing]

71
00:05:09,058 --> 00:05:10,601
You're the reason my family--

72
00:05:11,394 --> 00:05:13,354
-[Eun-gyeong] Gi-ho!
-[panting]

73
00:05:18,318 --> 00:05:19,777
Were you related to her?

74
00:05:21,195 --> 00:05:23,197
[mysterious music continues]

75
00:05:32,915 --> 00:05:33,875
Why do I…

76
00:05:36,669 --> 00:05:38,212
why do I deserve this?

77
00:05:39,672 --> 00:05:41,007
And more importantly…

78
00:05:43,301 --> 00:05:45,470
why the hell does my family deserve this?

79
00:05:48,056 --> 00:05:49,849
I mean, that day you came and…

80
00:05:50,683 --> 00:05:52,727
Came into my life and just ruined--

81
00:05:52,810 --> 00:05:53,978
[Hyang-cheol] That's not it.

82
00:05:57,565 --> 00:05:58,733
[tuts] That's not it.

83
00:06:02,487 --> 00:06:04,280
I was just… there.

84
00:06:05,656 --> 00:06:07,283
On that road, passing through,

85
00:06:07,367 --> 00:06:10,203
and you happened to be on that road.

86
00:06:17,418 --> 00:06:18,669
[Hyang-cheol sighs]

87
00:06:21,506 --> 00:06:22,757
Why were you there?

88
00:06:24,258 --> 00:06:26,469
On that day, at that moment.

89
00:06:27,762 --> 00:06:30,723
Like I said, I was just passing through.

90
00:06:32,558 --> 00:06:35,895
Instead of looking at me,
ask yourself those questions, you know?

91
00:06:35,978 --> 00:06:37,397
Stop shifting the blame.

92
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:40,066
Your family fell apart
because you guys just had bad luck,

93
00:06:40,149 --> 00:06:41,234
I guess.

94
00:06:42,151 --> 00:06:44,529
-It's got nothing to do with me.
-Hey, watch it.

95
00:06:45,321 --> 00:06:46,656
[Hyang-cheol sighs]

96
00:06:49,659 --> 00:06:50,952
Just clarifying.

97
00:06:52,370 --> 00:06:55,498
I mean, isn't that preferable
to a half-hearted apology?

98
00:06:55,581 --> 00:06:58,042

Let me give you a ride home.

102
00:07:36,456 --> 00:07:37,707
Oh, no. That's okay.

103
00:07:40,710 --> 00:07:42,003
Have you been doing all right?

104
00:07:44,797 --> 00:07:46,883
I heard that you moved out, so…

105
00:07:49,510 --> 00:07:50,928
Thanks for all your help.

106
00:07:51,012 --> 00:07:52,930
Uh, no. I couldn't. It's okay.

107
00:07:58,769 --> 00:08:00,521
To see him in person one more time,

108
00:08:01,981 --> 00:08:06,235
even though there wasn't much to say,
it means a lot to see with my own eyes.

109
00:08:14,827 --> 00:08:16,120
Hey, Officer Yoon.

110
00:08:20,833 --> 00:08:22,293
You should never be the frog.

111
00:08:25,338 --> 00:08:26,339
What?

112
00:08:29,300 --> 00:08:32,053
Don't be the frog
that got hit by the kids' rocks. [scoffs]

your body withers,

117
00:08:45,858 --> 00:08:47,735
and your breathing gets shallower…

118
00:08:50,071 --> 00:08:52,031
the last thing on your mind will be,

119
00:08:53,115 --> 00:08:54,617
"Who threw that stone?"

120
00:08:56,494 --> 00:08:58,496

Let's go.

-Yeah.

I'm seeing Yong-chae.

He's all the way here?

140

Is he in a hospital in Seoul?

Oh, thank you. No, I don't need it.

I'm not sure I feel good accepting it.

00:13:04,492 --> 00:13:05,367
Was it a rush?

181
00:13:05,993 --> 00:13:06,911
[captain slurps]

182
00:13:07,536 --> 00:13:08,579
[captain sighs]

183
00:13:10,831 --> 00:13:12,291
Why'd you choose to be a cop?

184
00:13:13,876 --> 00:13:16,629
Just looked like… a job I'd be good at.

185
00:13:16,712 --> 00:13:18,714
You're always, "Just this, just that."

186
00:13:19,548 --> 00:13:20,758
Were you in any clubs?

187
00:13:21,467 --> 00:13:22,468
Track and field.

188
00:13:22,968 --> 00:13:24,011
Were you any good?

189
00:13:24,678 --> 00:13:25,513
Not at all.

190
00:13:26,931 --> 00:13:29,016
Guess if you were, you would've gone pro.

191
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:33,062
Well, for someone who ran in school,
you chose one hell of a job.

192
00:13:35,689 --> 00:13:36,857
Why'd you take those shots?

193
00:13:38,734 --> 00:13:39,819

[camera shutter clicking]

196
00:13:50,621 --> 00:13:52,748
Are you just drawn to this?

197
00:13:53,749 --> 00:13:55,751
Murders, killers,

198
00:13:55,835 --> 00:13:58,420
the smell of blood, body parts?

199
00:13:59,171 --> 00:14:00,005
Is it exciting?

200
00:14:03,050 --> 00:14:05,344
You can be honest. I'm not gonna judge.

201
00:14:05,970 --> 00:14:07,596
The average person might find it troubling

202
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:10,140
if you told them
you found crime scenes exciting,

203
00:14:11,058 --> 00:14:11,934
but I understand.

204
00:14:12,977 --> 00:14:15,688
I heard how you caught
that serial bicycle thief.

205
00:14:15,771 --> 00:14:18,858
And how a random stop and search
led to a big arrest.

206
00:14:18,941 --> 00:14:22,278
And you were humble about it.
Time after time, "It was just luck."

207
00:14:22,361 --> 00:14:23,487
Was it now?

208
00:14:24,154 --> 00:14:27,741
Did you catch them 'cause your job is
to serve and protect? Doubt it.

209
00:14:29,118 --> 00:14:32,329
And seeing Ji Hyang-cheol today,
was it really a favor?

210
00:14:33,289 --> 00:14:34,415
Doubt it.

211
00:14:34,498 --> 00:14:37,626
No, you called me because you wanted
to see him for yourself.

212
00:14:42,172 --> 00:14:44,717
Some cops are driven
by a righteous sense of justice.

213
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:46,427
Some, it's revenge.

214
00:14:47,803 --> 00:14:50,097
Though I think the best
are driven by intuition.

215
00:14:51,473 --> 00:14:54,852
The way I see it, maybe we're all
just playing a big game of tag.

216
00:14:57,229 --> 00:15:00,149
And some of us are always it.
It's in our DNA.

217
00:15:07,865 --> 00:15:08,824
I'm sorry, Captain.

218
00:15:08,908 --> 00:15:10,534
-I'm not like that.
-[laughs]

219
00:15:13,037 --> 00:15:16,582
Well, if you ever change your mind,
come to Violent Crimes.

226
00:15:43,525 --> 00:15:44,443

227
00:15:45,110 --> 00:15:47,321
the smell of blood, body parts?

228
00:15:49,490 --> 00:15:50,783
Is it exciting?

What are you doing here?
You didn't have to come out here.

235
00:16:37,830 --> 00:16:39,540
-Are you all right?
-Let's get out.

236
00:16:39,623 --> 00:16:41,083
On that leg? Are you serious?

237
00:16:41,166 --> 00:16:44,420
Uh, just humor me, yeah?
I broke my damn ankle. I didn't--

238
00:16:44,503 --> 00:16:47,423
-Ui-seon got you these.
-[Yong-chae] Aw, our dear pharmacist!

[laughs]

240
00:16:48,424 --> 00:16:52,302
If she asks, tell her you're in Seoul
and not to worry about visiting.

241
00:16:53,262 --> 00:16:54,096
Seoul?

242
00:16:55,264 --> 00:16:56,265

Pretty good, huh?

245
00:17:02,021 --> 00:17:04,523
I'm leaving this hospital
ten kilos heavier.

00:17:07,526 --> 00:17:08,610
[Yong-chae sighs]

247
00:17:11,530 --> 00:17:12,948
[Yeong-ha] No, none of that.

248
00:17:13,699 --> 00:17:16,410
What? Not even with jjamppong?

249
00:17:18,120 --> 00:17:19,496
Gonna be good to drive?

250
00:17:20,205 --> 00:17:21,957
[Yeong-ha] I'll stay with you
for the night.

253
00:17:28,172 --> 00:17:30,215
-I had that guest?
-Huh?

254
00:17:30,883 --> 00:17:34,428
Remember? She was your guest
until your broken AC acted up.

255
00:17:35,054 --> 00:17:36,221
[Yong-chae] Ah!

256
00:17:36,305 --> 00:17:40,559
You mean that girl with the kid, right?
At the pool? I remember her.

257
00:17:44,938 --> 00:17:46,940
[unsettling music playing]

258
00:17:48,776 --> 00:17:51,195
I think that girl killed that child.

[Yeong-ha breathes shakily]

265
00:18:25,104 --> 00:18:26,188
She left something there.

266
00:18:27,481 --> 00:18:29,733
I thought I had her number,
but I guess I didn't.

267
00:18:30,317 --> 00:18:31,401
Last year?

268
00:18:34,446 --> 00:18:35,280
Yeah.

269
00:18:37,241 --> 00:18:38,784
[Yeong-chae] Then she would've called.

270
00:18:39,743 --> 00:18:41,245
What did she forget? Valuables?

271
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:46,458
Then you've gotta return it.

272
00:18:47,876 --> 00:18:49,837
Hey, was it that bad?

273
00:18:54,383 --> 00:18:56,051
Oh, I'm not that hungry.

[Yong-chae] Booking record?

276
00:19:05,477 --> 00:19:07,437
I got her number
when she paid the deposit,

277
00:19:07,521 --> 00:19:09,648
and the AC guy came the next day.

278
00:19:09,731 --> 00:19:13,944
Uh, here it is.
Booked under the name Ha Si-hyeon.

279

[Yeong-ha] The name for the booking
was the kid's,

284
00:19:25,164 --> 00:19:26,999
and the number was out of service.

285
00:19:28,959 --> 00:19:30,836
She had a key to my place

286
00:19:32,754 --> 00:19:34,840
and knew what my daughter looked like,

287
00:19:37,050 --> 00:19:38,886

It's really popular, actually.

You mean erase it all?

00:30:03,885 --> 00:30:06,387
If it's too bad,
it might not come off, so…

361
00:30:06,888 --> 00:30:08,306
Uh, gum will come off.

362
00:30:08,389 --> 00:30:10,099
Yes, in any case,
I'll have to take a look.

363
00:30:10,183 --> 00:30:13,061
So if you could bring it in,
that would be great. Thank you.

364
00:30:13,144 --> 00:30:14,187
Right, thanks.

365
00:30:14,938 --> 00:30:16,272
Hi, may I take your order?

366
00:30:16,773 --> 00:30:18,983
[woman] I'll take
an iced Americano, please.

367
00:30:19,067 --> 00:30:20,985
Iced Americano.

368
00:30:25,448 --> 00:30:27,200
[chuckles] All coins, huh?

369
00:30:32,705 --> 00:30:34,791
Could I take some pictures here?

370
00:30:34,874 --> 00:30:36,251
Huh? Like photos?

371
00:30:37,502 --> 00:30:39,045
It's incredibly cute.

372
00:30:39,128 --> 00:30:40,296
[register dings]

373
00:30:40,380 --> 00:30:43,091
I think the vibes in here
could inspire something in my paintings.

374
00:30:43,174 --> 00:30:45,552
Oh, of course. Please go ahead.

375
00:30:46,177 --> 00:30:47,345
[laughs]

376
00:30:47,428 --> 00:30:48,638
[register drawer closes]

377
00:30:51,099 --> 00:30:53,101
[stirring music playing]

378
00:31:09,868 --> 00:31:11,369
[eerie music plays]

379
00:31:11,452 --> 00:31:13,454
[music fades]

380
00:31:17,166 --> 00:31:19,878
I actually put a lot of thought
into the interior design.

381
00:31:19,961 --> 00:31:22,088
-I love it. It's so cute.
-[man laughs]

382
00:31:24,591 --> 00:31:26,217
[woman] Mmm! [sniffs]

383
00:31:26,843 --> 00:31:27,802
[slurps]

384
00:31:27,886 --> 00:31:30,930
This coffee's amazing.
You could run a café.

385
00:31:31,681 --> 00:31:34,767
Actually, at first, that was my plan.
Yeah, so…

386
00:31:35,435 --> 00:31:36,352
[woman] Mmm.

387
00:31:37,061 --> 00:31:38,396
You got a new regular.

388
00:31:39,647 --> 00:31:42,191
So what led you
to our neck of the woods, hmm?

389
00:31:42,775 --> 00:31:45,403
Are you staying
at a vacation rental around here?

390
00:31:46,613 --> 00:31:47,947
Just for the next month or so.

391
00:31:48,031 --> 00:31:50,575
Ah, is that right? Whose place is it?

392
00:31:51,284 --> 00:31:52,160
[inhales sharply]

393
00:31:52,243 --> 00:31:55,163
I'm blanking on the name right now,
but it's down that way.

394
00:31:56,205 --> 00:31:57,665
That's Yeong-ha's place.

395
00:31:57,749 --> 00:32:00,835
There's that big secluded path
that leads to the forest, isn't there?

396
00:32:00,919 --> 00:32:03,004
-Yeah.
-Yeah, his place is great.

397
00:32:03,087 --> 00:32:05,048
Hmm. I wonder why I didn't know though.

398
00:32:05,965 --> 00:32:09,177
I'm actually close with all the owners
around here. We're all buds, you know?

399
00:32:09,260 --> 00:32:10,386
[woman] Aah!

400
00:32:10,470 --> 00:32:13,056
I wonder why he kept this from us.

401
00:32:14,724 --> 00:32:16,351
[customer 1] We're ready to order.

402
00:32:16,434 --> 00:32:18,394
[man] Oh! Well, enjoy your coffee.

403
00:32:19,729 --> 00:32:22,065
-[customer 1] What are you getting?
-[customer 2] Hmm…

404
00:32:22,565 --> 00:32:25,234
-[man] Be right there!
-[customer 2] Hmm, chocolate latte?

405
00:32:25,985 --> 00:32:27,111
[door closes]

406
00:32:27,195 --> 00:32:28,988
[footsteps approaching]

407
00:32:30,740 --> 00:32:32,158
I want to watch a movie tonight.

408
00:32:47,465 --> 00:32:50,718
If something's on your mind, just ask.
Please. I mean it.

409
00:32:51,469 --> 00:32:52,637
There is something…

410
00:32:55,556 --> 00:32:56,683
I want to know.

411
00:33:09,612 --> 00:33:11,948
[Yeong-ha breathes deeply]

412
00:33:43,271 --> 00:33:45,273
[woman breathes deeply]

413
00:33:46,190 --> 00:33:47,191
Look at me now.

414
00:33:51,529 --> 00:33:54,574
[slurping]

415
00:34:02,498 --> 00:34:03,916
[woman smacks lips, sighs]

416
00:34:05,168 --> 00:34:06,252
You can eat it.

417
00:34:22,852 --> 00:34:24,312
Do you wish you could kill me?

418
00:34:31,152 --> 00:34:32,361
It's true, isn't it?

419
00:34:33,654 --> 00:34:34,822
What are you planning?

420
00:34:36,032 --> 00:34:36,991
What?

421
00:34:43,331 --> 00:34:45,041
I'm just a guest on your property,

422
00:34:46,334 --> 00:34:47,668
like anyone else.

423
00:34:48,544 --> 00:34:49,462
[chuckles]

424
00:34:50,296 --> 00:34:51,839
So how am I so different?

425
00:34:58,471 --> 00:35:00,807
-So where's the kid, then?
-What kid?

426
00:35:00,890 --> 00:35:03,267
The one you were with a year ago.
That kid.

427
00:35:04,644 --> 00:35:05,478
Si-hyeon.

428
00:35:05,561 --> 00:35:06,562
[chuckles]

429
00:35:09,148 --> 00:35:11,275
I have footage from the day you were here.

430
00:35:12,693 --> 00:35:14,403
Dashcam footage of you leaving alone.

431
00:35:15,029 --> 00:35:16,322
What else do you have?

432
00:35:19,575 --> 00:35:21,577
[mysterious music playing]

433
00:35:22,203 --> 00:35:24,622
I found bloodstains,
cleaning up your room.

434
00:35:25,373 --> 00:35:26,249
[woman] And?

435
00:35:29,544 --> 00:35:33,381
Towels… went missing also. Two did.

436
00:35:33,464 --> 00:35:34,298
So?

437
00:35:38,511 --> 00:35:39,470
The shower…

438
00:35:42,390 --> 00:35:43,683
stank of bleach.

439
00:35:47,145 --> 00:35:48,062
All right.

440
00:35:49,564 --> 00:35:51,232
What did you do afterwards?

441
00:35:57,113 --> 00:35:58,322
Let's get this straight.

442
00:35:59,031 --> 00:36:00,366
All you've got is…

443
00:36:02,660 --> 00:36:04,203
just a bit of dashcam footage, right?

444
00:36:06,372 --> 00:36:09,041
That's hardly… a smoking gun, is it?

445
00:36:11,294 --> 00:36:12,837
Fine, let's say you're right,

446
00:36:13,838 --> 00:36:16,883
that a kid and I came here together
one year ago,

447
00:36:16,966 --> 00:36:18,885
and then I left here all alone,

448
00:36:20,553 --> 00:36:22,263
and he disappeared into thin air.

449
00:36:23,014 --> 00:36:25,766
Well, if your theory's correct,
then where's the corpse?

450
00:36:27,059 --> 00:36:30,146
After that,
you could've gone to the police with this

451
00:36:30,229 --> 00:36:32,315
or even come to me for answers.

452
00:36:33,274 --> 00:36:35,735
But, no,
you washed the bloodstain you found,

453
00:36:35,818 --> 00:36:37,987
cleaned the whole house
from top to bottom,

454
00:36:38,070 --> 00:36:39,864
and replaced the missing towels.

455
00:36:41,824 --> 00:36:45,578
That was you…
who pretended not to recognize

456
00:36:45,661 --> 00:36:47,455
someone you thought about all year.

457
00:36:50,124 --> 00:36:52,501
In that case,
we can't be that different, right?

458
00:36:53,878 --> 00:36:54,962
Yeah, maybe not.

459
00:36:59,967 --> 00:37:01,844
Hmm, I wonder.

460
00:37:02,553 --> 00:37:05,848
Let's say you go to the police
and decide to tell them everything.

461
00:37:06,432 --> 00:37:09,977
I get charged as a murderer,
and you, mister…

462
00:37:10,061 --> 00:37:11,187
[gasps]

463
00:37:11,270 --> 00:37:13,898
…I mean, you covered it up
for a whole year.

464
00:37:13,981 --> 00:37:15,107
[Yeong-ha sighs]

465
00:37:15,650 --> 00:37:18,110
But seriously, think about it.
Really think about it.

466
00:37:18,194 --> 00:37:19,654
What did you see back then?

467
00:37:20,279 --> 00:37:22,490
Did anyone ever come sniffing around?

468
00:37:23,199 --> 00:37:24,367
If a child was murdered here,

469
00:37:24,450 --> 00:37:26,619
somebody would've come
to size the place up.

470
00:37:29,455 --> 00:37:30,414
Hmm.

471
00:37:32,375 --> 00:37:33,584
What if I said

472
00:37:35,169 --> 00:37:36,254
I wanted to buy this house?

473
00:37:37,004 --> 00:37:37,838
What?

474
00:37:37,922 --> 00:37:40,091
[woman laughs]

475
00:37:40,174 --> 00:37:41,592
[music fades]

476
00:37:41,676 --> 00:37:44,762
I don't know what significance
this place holds for you anymore, but

477
00:37:46,138 --> 00:37:50,685
it's just, um, come to mean
so, so much to me now.

478
00:37:52,228 --> 00:37:54,230
To be honest, before coming here,

479
00:37:54,313 --> 00:37:56,565
I really thought
I'd lost sight of who I was,

480
00:37:57,942 --> 00:37:58,859
but…

481
00:38:00,945 --> 00:38:02,488
perhaps I found her again.

482
00:38:03,197 --> 00:38:05,157
[unsettling music playing]

483
00:38:05,658 --> 00:38:07,326
-[scoffs]
-[chuckles]

484
00:38:08,995 --> 00:38:11,497
But, no, I'm not gonna sit here
and twist your arm.

485
00:38:12,540 --> 00:38:14,959
I'll just do this. One month a year.

486
00:38:16,210 --> 00:38:17,211
Just in the summer.

487
00:38:22,133 --> 00:38:25,303
Mm! Maybe let's try
to keep to ourselves though.

488
00:38:25,886 --> 00:38:27,346
We're better off like that.

489
00:38:32,518 --> 00:38:34,520
[tense music playing]

490
00:39:03,758 --> 00:39:04,717

491
00:39:12,058 --> 00:39:14,143
-Ui-seon, behind you. Coming through.
-Oh, okay.

492
00:39:19,273 --> 00:39:21,859
-[Ji-su] Oh! Here, I got it.
-[pharmacist] Oh, it's okay, Doctor.

493
00:39:21,942 --> 00:39:23,903
It's fine. I'll take this too.

494
00:39:23,986 --> 00:39:25,988
-[pharmacist] Thank you.
-It was a long day, huh?

495
00:39:26,072 --> 00:39:28,783
-[pharmacist] No, I'm fine.
-[Ji-su] Let's wrap up and get outta here.

496
00:39:28,866 --> 00:39:30,868
[pop music playing on stereo]

497
00:39:31,577 --> 00:39:32,870
[Ji-su] Long day, huh?

498
00:39:33,371 --> 00:39:35,247
[Ui-seon] Mm. Really long.

499
00:39:35,956 --> 00:39:37,625
God, it must be hard.

500
00:39:37,708 --> 00:39:38,876
I can still work.

501
00:39:39,585 --> 00:39:41,712
I'm surprised
you didn't grab a beer tonight.

502
00:39:43,589 --> 00:39:44,423
Yeah.

503
00:39:45,591 --> 00:39:48,260
I mean, it's fine unless you wanna wait
till I'm not pregnant anymore.

504
00:39:48,344 --> 00:39:49,512
All right. [chuckles]

505
00:39:50,012 --> 00:39:52,139
Excuse me! Can I get a beer?

506
00:39:52,223 --> 00:39:53,307
[employee] Of course.

507
00:39:53,933 --> 00:39:55,267
[Ji-su laughs]

508
00:39:57,895 --> 00:39:59,271
Hey, how's your dad doing?

509
00:40:01,190 --> 00:40:03,609
Mm, we talked earlier.
He's doing all right.

510
00:40:03,692 --> 00:40:04,652
[Ji-su] Hmm.

511
00:40:06,487 --> 00:40:08,906
Um, well, his place is nice and all, but

512
00:40:10,449 --> 00:40:13,160
I get a little worried
'cause he's all alone out there.

513
00:40:13,661 --> 00:40:18,165
How about suggesting he moves here?
And just use his place as a vacation home?

514
00:40:22,628 --> 00:40:23,712
[beer glass clatters]

515
00:40:23,796 --> 00:40:26,215
That's something
I want him to decide to do.

516
00:40:33,180 --> 00:40:35,641
-We can go to him.
-Hmm?

517
00:40:35,724 --> 00:40:37,476
You always had that idea

518
00:40:37,560 --> 00:40:39,979
about opening up a pharmacy
closer to your dad's place.

519
00:40:40,563 --> 00:40:43,065
That was back then.
Things are super different now.

520
00:40:43,149 --> 00:40:44,358
Uh, what's different?

521
00:40:45,192 --> 00:40:48,487
First floor, pharmacy.
Second floor, clinic. We can make it work.

522
00:40:52,575 --> 00:40:54,618
[woman] Hmm, I wonder.

523
00:40:54,702 --> 00:40:57,997
Let's say you go to the police
and decide to tell them everything.

524
00:40:58,080 --> 00:41:01,625
I get charged as a murderer,
and you, mister…

525
00:41:01,709 --> 00:41:02,877
[gasps]

526
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:05,421
…I mean, you covered it up
for a whole year.

529
00:41:08,132 --> 00:41:09,175
[woman] I wonder.

530
00:41:09,258 --> 00:41:12,303
Let's say you go to the police
and decide to tell them everything.
