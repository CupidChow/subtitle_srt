Let's talk on the way.

101
00:06:43,150 --> 00:06:44,070
This performance center

102
00:06:44,150 --> 00:06:45,580
was rented by a reality show crew.

103
00:06:45,610 --> 00:06:46,390
They're recording

104
00:06:46,430 --> 00:06:47,550
a music competition program.

105
00:06:47,780 --> 00:06:48,770
According to the crew,

106
00:06:48,950 --> 00:06:49,750
the competitors can't leave

107
00:06:49,750 --> 00:06:50,800
at will during the recording.

108
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:52,550
All three victims belong to

109
00:06:52,550 --> 00:06:53,510
the group TBBT.

110
00:06:53,870 --> 00:06:55,070
There are four people in this group.

111
00:06:55,550 --> 00:06:56,990
According to the staff's preliminary response

112
00:06:57,030 --> 00:06:58,530
and the cameras in the park, it's confirmed that

113
00:06:58,940 --> 00:06:59,750
on the night of the incident,

114
00:06:59,870 --> 00:07:00,620
no suspicious person

115
00:07:00,620 --> 00:07:01,600
had entered this studio.

116
00:07:01,910 --> 00:07:02,630
What do you mean?

117
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:04,310
They live in the studio?

118
00:07:04,830 --> 00:07:06,630
This kind of show is an idol reality show.

119
00:07:06,790 --> 00:07:08,670
Basically, idol group members

120
00:07:08,670 --> 00:07:09,630
live in the same house

121
00:07:09,870 --> 00:07:10,630
and their lives

122
00:07:10,630 --> 00:07:11,750
are observed for 24 hours a day.

123
00:07:12,590 --> 00:07:13,510
It's quite popular now.

(The Glory One)

129
00:07:19,910 --> 00:07:20,820
today is the third stage performance
(The Glory One)

130
00:07:20,820 --> 00:07:22,030
of the training camp.
(The Glory One)

131
00:07:46,070 --> 00:07:46,600
Captain Cheng.

132
00:07:48,540 --> 00:07:49,850
This is the first victim.

133
00:07:50,230 --> 00:07:51,750
The carotid artery had spurt-like bleeding.

134
00:07:52,070 --> 00:07:53,100
The angle of the blood spray shows

135
00:07:53,150 --> 00:07:53,870
the direction

136
00:07:53,890 --> 00:07:55,159
the first victim faced originally.

137
00:07:55,630 --> 00:07:57,360
Judging from the blood spray,

138
00:07:57,470 --> 00:07:58,970
the victim should be at the original location.

139
00:07:59,990 --> 00:08:01,180
This is the second victim.

140
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:03,310
The blood of the second victim's carotid artery

141
00:08:03,310 --> 00:08:04,230
sprayed directly

142
00:08:04,230 --> 00:08:05,590
onto the sofa of the third victim.

143
00:08:08,250 --> 00:08:09,110
About this position.

144
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:11,950
It means when the murderer committed the crime,

145
00:08:11,980 --> 00:08:13,150
he wasn't there.

146
00:08:13,300 --> 00:08:14,590
When he returned, he didn't realize

147
00:08:14,590 --> 00:08:15,510
his friends had been killed.

148
00:08:15,670 --> 00:08:16,770
He just sat directly

149
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:19,110
onto the sofa with the second victim's blood.

150
00:08:19,350 --> 00:08:20,160
Then he was killed.

151
00:08:27,750 --> 00:08:28,430
Captain Cheng.

152
00:08:30,910 --> 00:08:32,110
The person who reported it is an assistant.

153
00:08:32,230 --> 00:08:33,150
He's already been questioned.

154
00:08:33,669 --> 00:08:34,990
Today is the pre-recording

155
00:08:35,030 --> 00:08:36,289
of TBBT's third stage performance,

156
00:08:36,580 --> 00:08:36,630
(The Glory One)

157
00:08:36,630 --> 00:08:37,740
but only one person came.
(The Glory One)

158
00:08:37,740 --> 00:08:38,220
(The Glory One)

159
00:08:38,220 --> 00:08:38,830
His name is Chen Qin.
(The Glory One)

160
00:08:38,830 --> 00:08:39,470
(The Glory One)

161
00:08:39,470 --> 00:08:41,260
So, the assistant came to the dorm to find the other three
(The Glory One)

162
00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:42,750
and found the crime scene.

163
00:08:46,020 --> 00:08:46,780
Is this him?

164
00:08:47,510 --> 00:08:48,740
Yes, that's him.

165
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:52,080
Where is he?

166
00:08:52,310 --> 00:08:53,430
We have him under control.

167
00:08:55,480 --> 00:08:56,830
I checked the dozen surveillance cameras here

168
00:08:56,870 --> 00:08:58,190
and in the performance center.

169
00:08:58,590 --> 00:08:59,910
There's no evidence yet

170
00:09:00,110 --> 00:09:01,200
to prove that he is the murderer.

171
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:07,190
With all these surveillance cameras,

172
00:09:07,230 --> 00:09:08,030
nothing was captured?

173
00:09:08,270 --> 00:09:09,430
That's how it is for now.

174
00:09:12,910 --> 00:09:13,590
This case

175
00:09:13,630 --> 00:09:14,590
is so weird.

176
00:09:15,110 --> 00:09:16,110
The reporter also said...

177
00:09:18,990 --> 00:09:19,500
What?

178
00:09:20,750 --> 00:09:21,350
She said

179
00:09:21,510 --> 00:09:22,670
they were killed by a ghost.

180
00:09:25,510 --> 00:09:26,500
Who would believe that?

181
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:27,910
Li Han,

182
00:09:27,950 --> 00:09:28,790
go check all the surveillance cameras

183
00:09:28,830 --> 00:09:29,430
again.

184
00:09:29,450 --> 00:09:29,960
Yes.

185
00:09:34,230 --> 00:09:35,090
Was it just them

186
00:09:35,450 --> 00:09:36,590
living here usually?

187
00:09:36,590 --> 00:09:37,230
No one else?

188
00:09:37,250 --> 00:09:37,830
Yes.

189
00:09:39,060 --> 00:09:40,410
How did they usually

190
00:09:41,070 --> 00:09:42,860
take care of their trash?

191
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:44,910
According to the requirements of the crew,

192
00:09:44,950 --> 00:09:45,430
they did

193
00:09:45,430 --> 00:09:46,640
all the internal housekeeping themselves.

194
00:09:46,990 --> 00:09:47,820
The park's custodians

195
00:09:47,870 --> 00:09:49,070
would come every morning

196
00:09:49,110 --> 00:09:49,910
to help take out the trash

197
00:09:49,950 --> 00:09:51,230
and gifts from fans.

198
00:09:51,750 --> 00:09:52,550
These things

199
00:09:52,590 --> 00:09:53,710
were usually piled in the doorway,

200
00:09:53,860 --> 00:09:54,470
so...

201
00:09:57,500 --> 00:09:58,710
Where's today's trash?

202
00:10:00,260 --> 00:10:01,680
They were all cleaned up by the custodian.

204
00:10:04,790 --> 00:10:05,870

207
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:26,390
Why isn't Shen Yi here yet?

208
00:10:40,390 --> 00:10:41,150
Take this back.

209
00:10:41,350 --> 00:10:41,950
Yes, Captain Cheng.

210
00:10:47,630 --> 00:10:48,810
What took you so long?

211
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:51,080
I arrived long ago.

212
00:10:55,010 --> 00:10:55,710
What is this?

213
00:11:00,940 --> 00:11:01,610
What does it mean?

214
00:11:03,250 --> 00:11:04,430
If a person

215
00:11:04,430 --> 00:11:05,550
went through something scary when alive,

216
00:11:06,430 --> 00:11:07,590
they'd instinctively widen their eyes

217
00:11:07,630 --> 00:11:08,710
due to the extreme shock.

218
00:11:09,830 --> 00:11:10,700
If they were killed at this time,

219
00:11:10,870 --> 00:11:12,500
the body would spasm.

220
00:11:12,630 --> 00:11:13,350
The expression in that instant

221
00:11:13,390 --> 00:11:14,220
would become fixed.

222
00:11:14,850 --> 00:11:16,200
But look at his expression.

223
00:11:17,030 --> 00:11:18,030
It's so calm.

224
00:11:21,750 --> 00:11:22,710
You mean

225
00:11:22,750 --> 00:11:24,700
the calm expressions after their deaths

226
00:11:24,970 --> 00:11:26,400
were done on purpose by the killer?

227
00:11:27,670 --> 00:11:28,310
Rigor mortis caused

00:11:28,310 --> 00:11:29,700

229
00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:31,620
to be in a semi-closed state.

230
00:11:32,930 --> 00:11:33,710
So it seems

231
00:11:33,710 --> 00:11:34,590
there's another possibility.

232
00:11:37,630 --> 00:11:38,530
These three

233
00:11:38,950 --> 00:11:40,670
died while their minds were in a

234
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:41,870
highly relaxed state.

235
00:11:44,740 --> 00:11:45,790
For the rest, I'll go back

236
00:11:45,790 --> 00:11:47,030
and do a detailed autopsy.

237
00:11:52,750 --> 00:11:53,350
Du Cheng.

238
00:11:54,870 --> 00:11:55,590
Have you noticed

239
00:11:55,630 --> 00:11:56,550
the murderer's criminal psychology

240
00:11:56,550 --> 00:11:57,510
is very interesting?

241
00:11:58,230 --> 00:11:59,270
The corpses' faces

242
00:11:59,270 --> 00:12:00,270
have all been specially painted.

00:12:04,230 --> 00:12:05,230
let the murderer

245
00:12:05,270 --> 00:12:06,670
vent out their emotions.

246
00:12:09,250 --> 00:12:10,790
They had high emotional demands

247
00:12:11,990 --> 00:12:13,350
toward the three victims.

248
00:12:21,290 --> 00:12:22,720
Who would hate these three young men

249
00:12:22,760 --> 00:12:24,020
this much?

00:17:47,830 --> 00:17:48,470
You didn't feel well?

366
00:17:49,270 --> 00:17:49,830
No.

367
00:17:52,030 --> 00:17:53,190
I went to clean.

368
00:17:54,750 --> 00:17:56,650
They vomit and pee everywhere when they're drunk.

369
00:18:05,670 --> 00:18:06,600
One more!

370
00:18:08,190 --> 00:18:09,550
If they dirtied the bathroom,

371
00:18:09,550 --> 00:18:10,590
why did you have to clean it?

372
00:18:12,380 --> 00:18:13,700
Because I'm the leader.

373
00:18:15,630 --> 00:18:17,280
Our manager instructed me before.

374
00:18:17,950 --> 00:18:19,920
If the crew gave us a surprise visit

375
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:22,030
and they recorded

376
00:18:22,030 --> 00:18:23,430
how disgusting a boy band's bathroom was,

377
00:18:24,070 --> 00:18:25,340
I was afraid the company would yell at me again.

378
00:18:26,190 --> 00:18:27,550
So I had to go.

379
00:18:30,260 --> 00:18:30,790
(Personal information: Chen Qin, 21 years old)

380
00:18:30,790 --> 00:18:32,630
You acted a lot when you were young.
(Personal information: Chen Qin, 21 years old)

381
00:18:32,630 --> 00:18:32,710
(Personal information: Chen Qin, 21 years old)

382
00:18:32,710 --> 00:18:33,670
You debuted as a child star.
(Personal information: Chen Qin, 21 years old)

383
00:18:33,890 --> 00:18:34,910
Why did you stop acting?

384
00:18:36,430 --> 00:18:37,460
At that time,

385
00:18:38,110 --> 00:18:38,960
I had acne,

386
00:18:39,550 --> 00:18:40,380
my voice changed,

387
00:18:41,030 --> 00:18:42,360
and my height shot up.

388
00:18:42,910 --> 00:18:44,120
Gradually, people stopped hiring me.

389
00:18:46,630 --> 00:18:48,160
Since you're an actor,

390
00:18:48,910 --> 00:18:50,700
why did you sign with Lingdong Media,

391
00:18:50,750 --> 00:18:52,100
become the leader of TBBT,

392
00:18:52,150 --> 00:18:53,630
and even participate in an idol training camp?

393
00:18:54,190 --> 00:18:55,550
I came to this show

394
00:18:55,640 --> 00:18:57,230
to let more people know about me.

395
00:18:58,470 --> 00:18:59,720
If I win in the end,

396
00:19:00,580 --> 00:19:01,670
I will have a chance

397
00:19:01,670 --> 00:19:02,530
to act again.

398
00:19:02,910 --> 00:19:04,590
You value this opportunity very much.

399
00:19:05,300 --> 00:19:05,910
Yes.

400
00:19:08,500 --> 00:19:09,590
Since you care so much about it

401
00:19:10,030 --> 00:19:10,990
and you're the leader,

402
00:19:12,710 --> 00:19:14,110
then why didn't you all perform that well

403
00:19:14,190 --> 00:19:15,730
in the first few rounds?

404
00:19:18,670 --> 00:19:19,270
They...

405
00:19:20,520 --> 00:19:21,870
They didn't listen to me.

406
00:19:24,550 --> 00:19:25,940
And they were all rich kids.

407
00:19:27,750 --> 00:19:29,030
They thought packaging and marketing

408
00:19:29,030 --> 00:19:29,830
could easily get them

409
00:19:29,870 --> 00:19:30,750
what they wanted.

410
00:19:31,910 --> 00:19:32,750
So...

411
00:19:35,150 --> 00:19:36,830
They dragged you down?

412
00:19:40,590 --> 00:19:42,740
Then they died mysteriously.

413
00:19:44,730 --> 00:19:45,310
No.

414
00:19:45,330 --> 00:19:46,080
Their deaths

415
00:19:46,110 --> 00:19:47,180
have nothing to do with me.

416
00:19:47,630 --> 00:19:48,640
It really has nothing to do with me.

417
00:19:48,670 --> 00:19:49,560
Since last night,

418
00:19:49,590 --> 00:19:50,350
you had no interactions

419
00:19:50,350 --> 00:19:51,480
with the three of them.

420
00:19:51,510 --> 00:19:52,790
It's an important performance today.

421
00:19:52,810 --> 00:19:54,230
As the leader, you went out alone

422
00:19:54,250 --> 00:19:55,340
and didn't call any team members.

423
00:19:55,370 --> 00:19:56,760
And during this period,

424
00:19:56,790 --> 00:19:57,590
your three teammates happened to

425
00:19:57,630 --> 00:19:58,990
all die mysteriously.

426
00:19:59,020 --> 00:19:59,790
You tell me

427
00:19:59,790 --> 00:20:01,400
it's all a coincidence?

428
00:20:08,890 --> 00:20:10,050
(Living Room 05)

429
00:20:18,910 --> 00:20:20,060
Is this it?

430
00:20:20,310 --> 00:20:20,950
Yes.

431
00:20:47,390 --> 00:20:48,580
Mr. Shen.

432
00:20:49,110 --> 00:20:51,560
This shadow has no head.

433
00:20:52,270 --> 00:20:53,950
It won't really be that weird, right?

434
00:21:00,990 --> 00:21:01,730
Yes.

435
00:21:03,100 --> 00:21:04,190
I do hate them.

436
00:21:05,150 --> 00:21:05,990
I wish

437
00:21:05,990 --> 00:21:07,340
I killed them.

438
00:21:07,700 --> 00:21:09,270
But I really didn't do it!

439
00:21:09,270 --> 00:21:10,860
Why should I trust you?

440
00:21:35,350 --> 00:21:36,670
This is what they did to me.

441
00:21:38,950 --> 00:21:40,150
How dare I offend them?

442
00:21:42,470 --> 00:21:44,230
If I could kill all three of them,

443
00:21:46,270 --> 00:21:47,310
why would I end up like this?

444
00:21:56,550 --> 00:21:57,750
I didn't kill anyone.

445
00:22:03,700 --> 00:22:04,550
Help me zoom in

446
00:22:04,550 --> 00:22:05,470
the another reflector.

447
00:22:06,070 --> 00:22:06,590
Okay.

448
00:22:12,470 --> 00:22:13,250
Zoom in more.

449
00:22:13,660 --> 00:22:19,950
(Living Room 05)

450
00:22:21,070 --> 00:22:21,670
Look.

451
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:23,310
(Living Room 05)

452
00:22:23,310 --> 00:22:24,830
This is the killer's mouth and nose.

This is
(Living Room 05)

455
00:22:25,900 --> 00:22:26,900
This is

456
00:22:27,390 --> 00:22:28,290
the mouth and nose?

457
00:22:29,470 --> 00:22:30,360
Zoom in more.

458
00:22:35,800 --> 00:22:35,920
(Living Room 05)

459
00:22:35,920 --> 00:22:37,200
This is the lips.
(Living Room 05)

460
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:37,720
(Living Room 05)

461
00:22:37,720 --> 00:22:38,940
There's a highlight.
(Living Room 05)

462
00:22:39,710 --> 00:22:40,750
This fluorescent color

463
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:42,050
is lipstick.

464
00:22:42,470 --> 00:22:44,390
But the color of this lipstick

465
00:22:45,070 --> 00:22:46,250
is too weird.

466
00:22:47,050 --> 00:22:48,490
The ingredients of this lipstick

467
00:22:48,540 --> 00:22:49,990
probably includes fluorescent agent

468
00:22:50,070 --> 00:22:51,230
to improve the brightness

469
00:22:51,230 --> 00:22:52,150
and saturation.

470
00:22:52,500 --> 00:22:54,110
This can make your skin look brighter.

471
00:22:54,860 --> 00:22:56,340
But due to the influence of ambient light,

472
00:22:56,780 --> 00:22:58,480
the color of the lipstick changed.

473
00:22:59,030 --> 00:23:00,460
That's why it has this kind of effect.

474
00:23:00,830 --> 00:23:02,670
This was a planned murder.

475
00:23:15,750 --> 00:23:16,590
Officer,

476
00:23:17,750 --> 00:23:18,760
the three of them died.

477
00:23:19,390 --> 00:23:20,540
I have to continue my life.

478
00:23:23,080 --> 00:23:24,500
Don't make it difficult for me.

479
00:23:25,070 --> 00:23:26,430
We found in the surveillance cameras

480
00:23:27,020 --> 00:23:28,440
that after you left the bathroom

481
00:23:28,470 --> 00:23:29,550
for the last time yesterday night,

482
00:23:30,430 --> 00:23:31,270
you stayed

483
00:23:31,310 --> 00:23:32,590
at the hallway entrance for one minute.

484
00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:34,370
That place

485
00:23:34,630 --> 00:23:36,430
happened to be a blind spot of the cameras.

486
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:38,030
Why didn't you go straight back to your room?

487
00:23:41,150 --> 00:23:42,470
What did you do in that minute?

488
00:23:43,110 --> 00:23:43,790
I was hesitating.

489
00:23:43,870 --> 00:23:44,590
About what?

490
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:45,630
I wanted to leave.

491
00:23:45,960 --> 00:23:47,650
I wanted to leave the training camp and quit.

492
00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:52,370
Why?

493
00:23:54,030 --> 00:23:55,590
It felt meaningless.

494
00:23:57,450 --> 00:23:58,150
I came here

495
00:23:58,200 --> 00:23:58,830
to seriously

496
00:23:58,870 --> 00:24:00,350
do this well.

497
00:24:01,750 --> 00:24:02,870
That's not how they thought.

498
00:24:04,380 --> 00:24:05,030
They thought

499
00:24:05,030 --> 00:24:06,240
that they could bully me as they wished

500
00:24:06,260 --> 00:24:07,820
because of their money, power, and backgrounds.

501
00:24:08,710 --> 00:24:09,710
Why should I suffer

502
00:24:09,730 --> 00:24:10,590
that kind of treatment?

503
00:24:12,820 --> 00:24:14,070
Then why didn't you leave?

504
00:24:17,950 --> 00:24:19,270
Because I thought it through again.

505
00:24:21,550 --> 00:24:22,270
After all, the next day,

506
00:24:22,270 --> 00:24:23,400
we'd have a public performance.

507
00:24:25,580 --> 00:24:26,670
I worked hard for so long.

508
00:24:28,070 --> 00:24:29,310
They might not have cared,

509
00:24:31,390 --> 00:24:32,110
but I'd worked hard

510
00:24:32,130 --> 00:24:33,130
for so long

511
00:24:33,160 --> 00:24:34,010
for this opportunity.

512
00:24:34,040 --> 00:24:35,450
I had to hang in there.

513
00:24:36,300 --> 00:24:36,910
At least, I had to

514
00:24:36,910 --> 00:24:38,550
complete today's performance.

515
00:24:45,320 --> 00:24:46,430
(He Rongyue)

516
00:24:46,470 --> 00:24:48,740
The toxicology screening results for the three deceased are out.

517
00:24:48,900 --> 00:24:50,790
It's confirmed that they smoked large amounts of marijuana before their deaths.

518
00:24:53,070 --> 00:24:54,150
If a person

519
00:24:54,150 --> 00:24:55,270
went through something scary when alive...

520
00:24:55,750 --> 00:24:56,760
If they were killed at this time,

521
00:24:56,830 --> 00:24:58,540
the body would spasm.

522
00:24:59,290 --> 00:24:59,990
The expression in that instant

523
00:24:59,990 --> 00:25:01,030
would become fixed.

524
00:25:01,550 --> 00:25:03,010
But look at his expression.

525
00:25:03,100 --> 00:25:04,140
It's so calm.

526
00:25:04,630 --> 00:25:05,490
These three

527
00:25:06,380 --> 00:25:08,110
died while their minds were in a

528
00:25:08,110 --> 00:25:09,150
highly relaxed state.

529
00:25:09,870 --> 00:25:11,070
Your three teammates

530
00:25:12,470 --> 00:25:13,270
all took drugs.

531
00:25:15,190 --> 00:25:16,000
Did you know?

532
00:25:18,160 --> 00:25:18,830
Yes.

533
00:25:47,990 --> 00:25:48,870
Do you smoke?

534
00:25:50,510 --> 00:25:51,200
No.

535
00:25:54,630 --> 00:25:55,990
But they forced me to smoke it before.

536
00:25:58,070 --> 00:25:58,910
I refused.

537
00:26:01,300 --> 00:26:02,700
So they beat me even harder.

538
00:26:04,750 --> 00:26:05,510
Whether you smoked or not,

539
00:26:05,510 --> 00:26:06,580
we can find out easily with a test.

540
00:26:07,590 --> 00:26:09,190
I have a clear goal.

541
00:26:10,930 --> 00:26:12,350
I want to stand on the stage again

542
00:26:12,360 --> 00:26:13,830
and let my audience see me.

543
00:26:14,650 --> 00:26:15,470
I know clearly

544
00:26:15,470 --> 00:26:17,030
why I came here.

545
00:26:18,390 --> 00:26:19,670
I'm different from them.

546
00:26:47,950 --> 00:26:48,630
Turn off the light.

547
00:26:54,470 --> 00:26:55,430
No.

548
00:26:56,990 --> 00:26:58,270
The metallic sheen can produce reflections

549
00:26:58,270 --> 00:26:59,750
similar to polarization effects.

550
00:27:00,150 --> 00:27:00,820
Turn on the main light.

551
00:27:13,470 --> 00:27:14,020
Turn off the light.

552
00:27:17,670 --> 00:27:18,150
No.

553
00:27:18,910 --> 00:27:19,810

559

an arrogant dandy,

564
00:28:29,110 --> 00:28:29,670
and had gotten many

565
00:28:29,670 --> 00:28:31,190
administrative penalties for provoking trouble.

(Teammate Zhang Xiaowei) (Li Muhe) (Childhood friend Xiao Yuling)

574
00:28:36,910 --> 00:28:38,170
they often caused trouble.

575
00:28:38,390 --> 00:28:39,750
Later, they met Zhang Xiaowei.

576

In a trash bag

577

from the training camp,

578
00:28:42,510 --> 00:28:43,070
I found

579
00:28:43,110 --> 00:28:44,240
a bloody switchblade.

580
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:45,520
I suspected it's the crime tool

581
00:28:45,670 --> 00:28:46,840
and handed it over to Dr. He.

582
00:28:47,030 --> 00:28:47,750
We extracted

583
00:28:47,750 --> 00:28:48,730
the blood sample for comparison

584
00:28:48,790 --> 00:28:49,830
and confirmed that this switchblade

585
00:28:49,830 --> 00:28:50,390
was the weapon

586
00:28:50,390 --> 00:28:51,810
that killed the three victims.

587
00:28:55,270 --> 00:28:56,230
The fingerprints on the weapon

588
00:28:56,270 --> 00:28:57,320
are not Chen Qin's.

589
00:28:57,550 --> 00:28:58,590
We compared it with the fingerprint bank.

590
00:28:58,950 --> 00:29:00,110
No criminal records were found.

591
00:29:00,630 --> 00:29:02,550
If it was really for venting anger,

592
00:29:03,270 --> 00:29:03,950
aren't their wounds

593
00:29:03,970 --> 00:29:05,510
a bit too shallow?

594
00:29:06,040 --> 00:29:06,790
That's because

595
00:29:06,790 --> 00:29:07,920
they'd taken drugs

596
00:29:08,110 --> 00:29:08,830
and couldn't move.

597
00:29:09,950 --> 00:29:11,280
At the crime scene,

598
00:29:11,310 --> 00:29:12,480
we found the e-cigarettes

599
00:29:12,500 --> 00:29:14,010
the three victims had used before.

600
00:29:14,260 --> 00:29:15,710
Through a toxicology test,

601
00:29:16,030 --> 00:29:17,310
it's confirmed that it contains a high concentration

602
00:29:17,330 --> 00:29:18,300

619

basically match up.

620
00:29:36,190 --> 00:29:37,230

626

At that time, the victims were already killed.

627
00:29:43,190 --> 00:29:44,190
He didn't have time to commit the crime.

628
00:29:46,270 --> 00:29:48,230

629
00:29:49,870 --> 00:29:51,190
how did the murderer enter the park?

630
00:29:56,990 --> 00:29:57,910
Does the park have any other

631

hidden entrances?

632
00:29:59,230 --> 00:30:00,140

633
00:30:00,910 --> 00:30:01,620

00:35:57,130 --> 00:35:58,110
and the ghost took them away.

735
00:35:58,110 --> 00:35:59,230
Stop with the superstitions.

736
00:35:59,630 --> 00:36:01,060
What exactly does this have to do with you?

737
00:36:01,430 --> 00:36:02,630
Li Dajiang financed

738
00:36:02,670 --> 00:36:04,590
a large sum of money to promote his son.

739
00:36:07,110 --> 00:36:08,180
He didn't even require popularity.

740
00:36:08,210 --> 00:36:09,720
What's wrong with kissing up to him?

741
00:36:10,190 --> 00:36:11,550
I just need to spend money to promote people

742
00:36:11,570 --> 00:36:12,420
and take care of the investors.

743
00:36:12,450 --> 00:36:13,850
Isn't that what I should do?

744
00:36:14,910 --> 00:36:15,790
As for the lipstick,

745
00:36:16,950 --> 00:36:18,070
I gave them a few.

746
00:36:18,670 --> 00:36:19,650
As for who they gave it to,

747
00:36:19,750 --> 00:36:20,870
I wouldn't know.

748
00:36:28,590 --> 00:36:29,550
I beg you.

749
00:36:29,780 --> 00:36:31,270
Let me take it away.

750
00:36:31,470 --> 00:36:33,070
Let me take it to a psychic, okay?

751
00:36:33,150 --> 00:36:33,950
Take her back.

752
00:36:34,430 --> 00:36:34,940
Let's go.

753
00:36:35,020 --> 00:36:36,540
No one can stop it.

754
00:36:36,750 --> 00:36:37,830
We'll all die.

755
00:36:38,710 --> 00:36:40,570
We will be killed by our own foolishness.

756
00:36:41,180 --> 00:36:42,480
We'll all die.

757
00:36:42,670 --> 00:36:43,470
We'll all die.

758
00:36:43,510 --> 00:36:45,790
The drugs messed up her brain.

759
00:36:48,150 --> 00:36:48,750
Captain Cheng,

760
00:36:49,070 --> 00:36:50,030
then this thing...

761
00:36:50,230 --> 00:36:50,940
Take it back.

762
00:36:52,470 --> 00:36:53,160
What are you afraid of?

763
00:36:53,550 --> 00:36:54,790

Captain Cheng is back.

766
00:37:12,270 --> 00:37:12,870
Director Zhang asked you

767
00:37:12,870 --> 00:37:13,630
to go to her office.

(Special Contribution Award)

770
00:37:28,230 --> 00:37:29,250
Director Zhang, you're looking for me?

771
00:37:30,870 --> 00:37:31,650
You're here?

772
00:37:32,190 --> 00:37:32,870
Look at my mess.

773
00:37:32,870 --> 00:37:33,520
You have nowhere to sit.

774
00:37:33,550 --> 00:37:34,230
Why don't you sit here?

775
00:37:34,230 --> 00:37:35,670
No, no, no. You can sit.

776
00:37:35,670 --> 00:37:36,690
I'll stand.

777
00:37:38,070 --> 00:37:39,300
Let's get down to business.

778
00:37:39,430 --> 00:37:40,700
What's going on with the training camp?

779
00:37:40,870 --> 00:37:42,020
Is the evidence collection over?

780
00:37:42,110 --> 00:37:42,870
Almost.

781
00:37:43,550 --> 00:37:44,640
Here's the thing.

782
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:45,750
The TV station

783
00:37:45,750 --> 00:37:47,680
told the PR department

784
00:37:47,910 --> 00:37:49,430
that everyone in the training camp

785
00:37:49,430 --> 00:37:50,470
is in panic now.

786
00:37:50,470 --> 00:37:51,680
There are all sorts of rumors.

787
00:37:52,030 --> 00:37:53,140
This show has already

788
00:37:53,140 --> 00:37:54,270
aired a few episodes.

789
00:37:54,350 --> 00:37:55,870
If the broadcast suddenly stops,

790
00:37:55,910 --> 00:37:57,190
they're afraid the public discourse

791
00:37:57,190 --> 00:37:58,390
will have more problems,

792
00:37:58,950 --> 00:38:00,110
so they came

793
00:38:00,230 --> 00:38:01,330
to ask us

794
00:38:01,470 --> 00:38:02,710
to lift the restrictions

795
00:38:02,710 --> 00:38:03,700
if conditions permit it

796
00:38:03,750 --> 00:38:05,670
and reduce the negative impact of this case.

797
00:38:05,870 --> 00:38:06,750
Of course,

798
00:38:06,750 --> 00:38:07,790
the case is top priority.

799
00:38:08,540 --> 00:38:09,050
Alright.

800
00:38:09,230 --> 00:38:10,320
I'll confirm it with the forensics

801
00:38:10,320 --> 00:38:11,030
and trace examiners again.

802
00:38:11,070 --> 00:38:11,610
Okay.

803
00:38:11,870 --> 00:38:12,960
Tell me if it doesn't work.

804
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:13,700
I'll go tell them.

805
00:38:13,840 --> 00:38:14,290
Okay.

806
00:38:14,590 --> 00:38:15,360
Thank you, Director Zhang.

807
00:38:15,470 --> 00:38:16,350
Let me help you.

808
00:38:18,190 --> 00:38:19,230
Have you finished packing?

809
00:38:20,110 --> 00:38:21,050
Not yet.

(Public Security)

811
00:38:30,530 --> 00:38:32,400
(Beijiang City Public Security Bureau, Beijiang Branch)

812
00:38:42,310 --> 00:38:43,640
Why did you bring the giraffe?

813
00:38:43,930 --> 00:38:44,980
Look at this.

814
00:38:47,320 --> 00:38:49,120
If the murderer used this posture,

815
00:38:49,420 --> 00:38:51,120
they could've hidden inside the giraffe.

816
00:38:57,830 --> 00:38:58,430
Today,

817
00:38:58,430 --> 00:38:59,630
I drew the internal structure

818
00:38:59,630 --> 00:39:00,350
of the giraffe.

819
00:39:05,800 --> 00:39:06,590
Then I tried

820
00:39:06,590 --> 00:39:07,430
some possibilities.

821
00:39:24,930 --> 00:39:26,080
Look at this.

822
00:39:27,710 --> 00:39:29,070
Do you remember the shadow we saw

823
00:39:29,070 --> 00:39:30,030
in the surveillance video?

824
00:39:30,620 --> 00:39:31,880
I went back to the scene.

825
00:39:32,430 --> 00:39:33,950
After comparing the light source of the scene,

826
00:39:34,110 --> 00:39:34,580
I found

827
00:39:34,580 --> 00:39:35,630
the reflection point of this shadow.

828
00:39:36,150 --> 00:39:37,220
It's the stainless-steel ice bucket

829
00:39:37,270 --> 00:39:38,230
in the corner.

830
00:39:41,230 --> 00:39:42,710
This monster's form

831
00:39:42,990 --> 00:39:44,580
matches the inside structure

832
00:39:44,790 --> 00:39:46,020
of the giraffe.

833
00:39:46,430 --> 00:39:47,500
That means

834
00:39:47,630 --> 00:39:48,870
the murderer likely

835
00:39:48,910 --> 00:39:49,910
hid themselves inside

836
00:39:49,910 --> 00:39:50,950
the giraffe,

837
00:39:51,230 --> 00:39:52,790
then crawled out and committed the crime.

838
00:39:52,950 --> 00:39:53,650
But...

839
00:39:54,430 --> 00:39:55,650
The average person

840
00:39:56,270 --> 00:39:57,990
can't do this posture at all.

841
00:39:58,310 --> 00:39:59,640
What if

842
00:40:00,230 --> 00:40:01,070
the murderer

843
00:40:01,090 --> 00:40:02,540
is naturally flexible?

844
00:40:03,790 --> 00:40:04,750
Frame by frame, I extracted

845
00:40:04,790 --> 00:40:06,480
the murderer's shadow from different angles

846
00:40:06,630 --> 00:40:07,990
and combined them.

847
00:40:08,190 --> 00:40:08,870
Adding in a bit of

848
00:40:08,870 --> 00:40:10,070
human anatomy knowledge,

849
00:40:11,310 --> 00:40:12,450
the murderer's figure

850
00:40:13,950 --> 00:40:14,790
looks something like this.

851
00:40:18,750 --> 00:40:19,340
This...

852
00:40:21,230 --> 00:40:23,030
When other possibilities are eliminated,

853
00:40:24,230 --> 00:40:25,070
the remaining one,

854
00:40:25,510 --> 00:40:26,840
no matter how unbelievable,

855
00:40:27,310 --> 00:40:28,330
is the truth.

856
00:40:37,780 --> 00:40:38,630
So,

857
00:40:39,750 --> 00:40:41,230
according to your speculation,

858
00:40:41,870 --> 00:40:44,070
the murderer hid in the giraffe,

859
00:40:44,470 --> 00:40:45,900
and was placed in the doorway.

860
00:40:46,110 --> 00:40:48,150
When the cameras were covered

861
00:40:48,150 --> 00:40:49,390
or turned around,

862
00:40:50,230 --> 00:40:51,590
they crawled out from there,

863
00:40:51,700 --> 00:40:53,090
went around the sofa,

864
00:40:53,260 --> 00:40:54,230
and killed three people

865
00:40:54,230 --> 00:40:56,190
who were already immobilized?

866
00:40:58,440 --> 00:40:58,910
Yes.

867
00:41:12,030 --> 00:41:13,630
How did the murderer know

868
00:41:14,470 --> 00:41:15,630
when the cameras would

869
00:41:15,630 --> 00:41:17,070
be turned or covered?

870
00:41:17,510 --> 00:41:18,590
How did they know

871
00:41:19,480 --> 00:41:20,590
when the three of them

872
00:41:20,590 --> 00:41:21,590
would lose their abilities to move?

873
00:41:25,720 --> 00:41:26,320
Captain Cheng.

874
00:41:28,470 --> 00:41:29,150
This

875
00:41:29,220 --> 00:41:30,180
is quite firm.

876
00:41:34,390 --> 00:41:36,030
These dolls in TBBT's dorm

877
00:41:36,070 --> 00:41:37,420
were all gifted by the fan club.

878
00:41:37,510 --> 00:41:38,990
The staff were responsible for moving it into the dorm.

879
00:41:39,670 --> 00:41:40,540
The staff said

880
00:41:40,790 --> 00:41:41,510
this giraffe

881
00:41:41,510 --> 00:41:43,050
was sent in on the day of the incident.

882
00:41:43,150 --> 00:41:43,920
He also said

883
00:41:44,030 --> 00:41:45,350
it was heavier than other dolls.

884
00:41:49,870 --> 00:41:51,390
Did you find out who sent it?

885
00:41:52,030 --> 00:41:52,750
This gift

886
00:41:52,790 --> 00:41:53,590
just appeared

887
00:41:53,630 --> 00:41:54,570
in front of the park.

888
00:41:54,790 --> 00:41:55,590
They didn't see the sender.

889
00:42:00,190 --> 00:42:01,320
Go ask the fan club.

890
00:42:01,670 --> 00:42:02,430
Check who sent in

891
00:42:02,430 --> 00:42:03,320
this giraffe.

892
00:42:03,550 --> 00:42:04,070
Got it.

893
00:42:13,410 --> 00:42:15,080
Using the information provided by the fan club,

894
00:42:15,120 --> 00:42:16,470
I found out that the fan

895
00:42:16,470 --> 00:42:18,280
who bought the giraffe is called Little Eggshell.

896
00:42:18,870 --> 00:42:20,080
Her real name is Yuan Zhaodi.

897
00:42:20,130 --> 00:42:21,470
Chen Qin's loyal fan.

898
00:42:21,790 --> 00:42:22,580
In the fandom,

899
00:42:22,580 --> 00:42:23,670
she's quite radical.

900
00:42:23,720 --> 00:42:24,550
Her personality is introverted.

901
00:42:51,990 --> 00:42:52,990

902
00:42:54,790 --> 00:42:55,640

Yuan Zhaodi!
♫The body of sand turns into rotten water♫

925
00:43:23,330 --> 00:43:25,340
♫The heart of diamond is eternal♫

926
00:43:26,430 --> 00:43:27,890
♫I want to escape from this cold morning♫

927
00:43:28,720 --> 00:43:30,450
♫Hug your lingering warmth♫

928
00:43:30,800 --> 00:43:32,660
♫It melts me♫

929
00:43:33,400 --> 00:43:35,180
♫In the whirlpool of fantasy♫

930
00:43:36,070 --> 00:43:37,760
♫Make the fire flare♫

931
00:43:38,890 --> 00:43:41,250
♫Break everything♫
