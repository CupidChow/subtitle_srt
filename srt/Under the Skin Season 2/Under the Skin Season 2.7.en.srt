00:01:50,090 --> 00:01:53,330
(Beijiang City Public Security Bureau, Beijiang Branch)

5
00:02:12,510 --> 00:02:14,590
What does this picture mean?

6
00:02:16,460 --> 00:02:18,020
I want to tell you a story.

7
00:02:19,970 --> 00:02:21,240
In Greek mythology,

8
00:02:21,510 --> 00:02:22,720
there is a legend

9
00:02:22,780 --> 00:02:25,260
that the gods in heaven were in discord

10
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:27,780
and the world was on the brink of disaster.

11
00:02:28,020 --> 00:02:29,640
At this critical moment,

12
00:02:30,350 --> 00:02:31,990
a goddess in a white robe and golden crown

13
00:02:32,010 --> 00:02:33,230
suddenly stepped forward.

14
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:34,910
She took on the responsibility of mediation

15
00:02:34,950 --> 00:02:36,150
and judgment.

16
00:02:37,420 --> 00:02:39,050
In one hand, she held a scale.

17
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:41,060
In the other, a sword.

18
00:02:42,190 --> 00:02:43,510
Her eyes were blindfolded.

19
00:02:44,510 --> 00:02:46,010
The scale represented choice.

20
00:02:46,980 --> 00:02:49,060
The sword represented judgment.

21
00:02:50,350 --> 00:02:51,910
The blindfold symbolized justice.

22
00:02:52,810 --> 00:02:54,180
After that, she was revered

23
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:55,320
the Goddess of Justice,

24
00:02:57,190 --> 00:02:58,310
Themis.

25
00:03:06,110 --> 00:03:07,670
The silhouette of you holding others up

26
00:03:09,110 --> 00:03:09,790
is very similar to this

27
00:03:09,790 --> 00:03:11,520
blindfolded goddess.

28
00:03:12,610 --> 00:03:14,170
The cliff is your sword.

29
00:03:18,110 --> 00:03:18,670
(This path is safe to see the Auroral Mist)

30
00:03:18,670 --> 00:03:20,510
The signpost symbolizes the scale of choice.
(This path is safe to see the Auroral Mist)

31
00:03:20,510 --> 00:03:21,110
The signpost symbolizes the scale of choice.

32
00:03:23,420 --> 00:03:24,230
Back then,

33
00:03:25,470 --> 00:03:26,870
out of a sense of justice in your heart,

34
00:03:27,340 --> 00:03:28,579
you chose to save someone.

35
00:03:29,860 --> 00:03:30,880
But because of that,

36
00:03:30,910 --> 00:03:32,040
your sister fell off the cliff.

37
00:03:32,780 --> 00:03:33,790
This is

38
00:03:34,050 --> 00:03:35,160
what motivated you to become

39
00:03:35,190 --> 00:03:37,430
a so-called judge in the first place.

40
00:03:48,140 --> 00:03:49,250
Officer Shen,

41
00:03:50,450 --> 00:03:51,270
as police officers,

42
00:03:51,310 --> 00:03:52,610
you should understand better than I do

43
00:03:53,030 --> 00:03:54,430
that in this world,

44
00:03:54,860 --> 00:03:57,180
people suddenly leave every day,

45
00:03:57,790 --> 00:03:58,670
without reason.

46
00:04:01,880 --> 00:04:03,300
When answers can't be found,

47
00:04:04,670 --> 00:04:06,210
people around me all tell me

48
00:04:07,050 --> 00:04:08,080
it's the will of heaven.

49
00:04:08,730 --> 00:04:09,860
It's fate.

50
00:04:11,540 --> 00:04:13,350
Juan's fate

51
00:04:13,510 --> 00:04:14,970
might have been destined to end

52
00:04:15,350 --> 00:04:16,310
at eight years old.

53
00:04:18,190 --> 00:04:19,310
Without the mountaineering team,

54
00:04:19,430 --> 00:04:20,120
she might have left

55
00:04:20,140 --> 00:04:21,410
due to something else.

56
00:04:24,990 --> 00:04:25,710
I choose

57
00:04:25,750 --> 00:04:27,160
not to pursue this matter.

58
00:04:29,590 --> 00:04:30,350
Is that wrong?

59
00:04:30,820 --> 00:04:32,360
This isn't some divine will.

60
00:04:33,350 --> 00:04:34,120
It's because back then,

61
00:04:34,150 --> 00:04:36,000
those climbers' stubbornness

62
00:04:37,470 --> 00:04:38,980
led to these consequences.

63
00:04:40,300 --> 00:04:41,530
And not one of them

64
00:04:41,550 --> 00:04:43,280
was willing to go with you to search for your sister.

65
00:04:45,370 --> 00:04:46,550
You hate them

66
00:04:47,530 --> 00:04:48,830
because your sister's death

67
00:04:49,670 --> 00:04:50,790
has become an eternal knot

68
00:04:50,830 --> 00:04:52,590
in your heart that you can't untie.

69
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:55,240
So you started to turn yourself

70
00:04:55,270 --> 00:04:56,890
into a judge.

71
00:04:58,100 --> 00:04:59,110
You want to punish those

72
00:04:59,150 --> 00:05:00,300
who only care about their own lives

73
00:05:00,350 --> 00:05:01,970
and disregard others.

74
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:07,780
You meticulously set up

75
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:09,550
this mechanism for choosing.

76
00:05:12,740 --> 00:05:14,590
You want those selfish people

77
00:05:16,390 --> 00:05:18,080
to accompany Juan in death.

78
00:05:22,260 --> 00:05:24,260
I often feel dazed afterwards,

79
00:05:25,150 --> 00:05:26,860
wondering if I had saved my sister

80
00:05:29,570 --> 00:05:31,160
and it was me who fell down the mountain.

81
00:05:33,740 --> 00:05:35,120
I was the one who died,

82
00:05:37,630 --> 00:05:39,350
which is why I'm like

83
00:05:40,150 --> 00:05:42,210
a wandering ghost on the path to the underworld,

84
00:05:45,130 --> 00:05:47,260
constantly circling in the mountains.

85
00:05:50,570 --> 00:05:52,380
I hate those selfish people.

86
00:06:01,100 --> 00:06:01,720
Come.

87
00:06:09,390 --> 00:06:10,940
Come.

88
00:06:12,260 --> 00:06:13,060
Let me.

89
00:06:13,530 --> 00:06:14,150
Let me.

90
00:06:32,850 --> 00:06:33,830
Ma!

91
00:06:35,950 --> 00:06:36,980
Ma!

92
00:06:37,860 --> 00:06:38,710
Ma!

93
00:06:39,490 --> 00:06:40,409
Help!

94
00:06:46,590 --> 00:06:47,540
Ma!

95
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:48,600
Professor Ma,

96
00:06:49,300 --> 00:06:50,970
come quickly and give me a hand.

97
00:06:50,990 --> 00:06:52,580
I can't hold on much longer.

98
00:07:15,730 --> 00:07:16,840
Why?

99

Phone.

102
00:08:03,380 --> 00:08:04,270
Give it to me.

103
00:08:04,780 --> 00:08:06,760
Just a moment, right away.

104
00:08:10,430 --> 00:08:11,130
Hello?

105
00:08:11,850 --> 00:08:12,730
Is this 120?

106
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:14,480
Someone here has fallen and is injured.

107
00:08:14,510 --> 00:08:15,490
It's a serious fall.

108
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:17,470
The address?

109
00:08:18,230 --> 00:08:19,090
The address is...

110
00:08:19,700 --> 00:08:21,650
Fengdu Village, Mt. Fengdu.

111
00:08:22,190 --> 00:08:22,790
Yes.

112
00:08:24,750 --> 00:08:25,320
When you arrive,

113
00:08:25,340 --> 00:08:26,900
I'll come out to meet you right away.

114
00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:28,960
Okay, okay.

115
00:08:39,020 --> 00:08:40,120
About what just happened,

116
00:08:40,940 --> 00:08:42,100
you saw it all too.

117
00:08:49,420 --> 00:08:51,290
Anyway, there's nothing I care about

118
00:08:51,980 --> 00:08:53,520
in this world now.

119
00:08:56,020 --> 00:08:58,080
Whether I go to prison or get shot,

120
00:08:59,320 --> 00:09:00,290
it's all the same to me.

121
00:09:20,870 --> 00:09:21,430
Hello,

122
00:09:22,340 --> 00:09:23,100
I'm calling to report a crime.

123
00:09:34,110 --> 00:09:34,790
Hello?

124
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:36,770
Hello,

125
00:09:37,540 --> 00:09:38,560
I want to report a crime.

126
00:09:39,250 --> 00:09:40,310
Today,

127
00:09:41,030 --> 00:09:41,920
I went mountain-climbing

128
00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:43,830
with my husband at Mt. Fengdu.

129
00:09:44,410 --> 00:09:45,790
While climbing,

130
00:09:46,750 --> 00:09:49,020
I... I fell from the mountain.

131
00:09:51,110 --> 00:09:51,790
I...

132
00:09:52,910 --> 00:09:53,790

133
00:09:54,260 --> 00:09:55,460
He's missing.

134
00:09:59,750 --> 00:10:00,700
Yes,

135
00:10:00,790 --> 00:10:01,510
I...

136
00:10:02,850 --> 00:10:04,800
I called 120.

137
00:10:05,950 --> 00:10:06,730
Thank you.

138
00:10:10,770 --> 00:10:11,340
You...

139
00:10:14,060 --> 00:10:15,040
What are you...

140
00:10:16,510 --> 00:10:17,790
You're a kind person.

141
00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:20,920
You saved my life.

142
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,320
His death

143
00:10:24,950 --> 00:10:25,910
has nothing to do

144
00:10:25,930 --> 00:10:27,490
with you or me.

145
00:10:29,340 --> 00:10:30,980
When that man let go of my hand

146
00:10:32,150 --> 00:10:33,860
and even forced you

147
00:10:34,220 --> 00:10:36,220
to let go of my hand as well,

148
00:10:37,060 --> 00:10:39,040
he already made his choice.

149
00:10:43,830 --> 00:10:45,450
He wanted to kill me

150
00:10:46,590 --> 00:10:47,840
but failed,

151
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:50,080
and ended up

152
00:10:50,110 --> 00:10:51,070
losing his own life.

153
00:10:52,630 --> 00:10:53,390
This is

154
00:10:54,230 --> 00:10:56,420
karma.

Remember.

156
00:11:06,700 --> 00:11:08,310
Karma.

157
00:11:11,030 --> 00:11:11,910
Afterwards,

158
00:11:12,460 --> 00:11:14,130
I threw Ma Huainan's body

159
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:17,670
into the sinkhole.

160
00:11:23,560 --> 00:11:24,910
So you admit

161
00:11:25,730 --> 00:11:27,240
that you killed Ma Huainan?

162
00:11:30,670 --> 00:11:32,040
It was his own choice.

163
00:11:34,890 --> 00:11:36,230
It's karma.

00:12:43,230 --> 00:12:43,990
How did she die?

194
00:12:45,710 --> 00:12:46,510
I killed her.

195
00:12:54,760 --> 00:12:55,700
How did you kill her?

196
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:02,350
This girl

197
00:13:02,390 --> 00:13:03,550
came alone to me.

198
00:13:05,540 --> 00:13:07,100
She asked me to take her to Mist Cliff.

199
00:13:08,290 --> 00:13:09,630
But because of her fear of heights,

200
00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:12,160
she only made it halfway.

201
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:27,390
You're afraid of heights?

202
00:13:33,430 --> 00:13:34,590
This is too high.

203
00:13:37,430 --> 00:13:38,750
You knew you were afraid of heights,

204
00:13:38,770 --> 00:13:39,910
yet you still came to climb the mountain.

205
00:13:40,050 --> 00:13:41,190
Let's go back down.

206
00:13:42,010 --> 00:13:42,850
No,

207
00:13:43,230 --> 00:13:43,970
I won't go back.

208
00:13:45,310 --> 00:13:46,670
I want to reach the top of Mist Cliff.

209
00:13:46,690 --> 00:13:48,070
At your current pace,

210
00:13:48,150 --> 00:13:48,870
by the time you reach the top,

211
00:13:48,990 --> 00:13:50,530
the Auroral Mist will have long dispersed.

212
00:13:50,590 --> 00:13:51,750
I still want to go up.

213
00:13:54,300 --> 00:13:55,170
I can do it.

214
00:13:55,670 --> 00:13:56,510
Please lead the way.

215
00:13:57,910 --> 00:13:58,440
Let's go.

216
00:14:17,350 --> 00:14:18,110
Why did you come alone

217
00:14:18,150 --> 00:14:18,990
to this place?

218
00:14:19,750 --> 00:14:20,800
I found it online.

219
00:14:21,310 --> 00:14:22,470
They say the scenery here is beautiful.

220
00:14:22,590 --> 00:14:23,560
Resting here eternally

221
00:14:23,590 --> 00:14:24,530
should be nice.

222
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,220
You're so young.

223
00:14:27,900 --> 00:14:29,210
Stop thinking about dying.

224
00:14:29,590 --> 00:14:31,070
Do you think death can solve all problems?

225
00:14:31,820 --> 00:14:34,000
Death indeed can't solve problems,

226
00:14:36,110 --> 00:14:36,990
but death can

227
00:14:38,850 --> 00:14:41,030
solve the person with problems.

228
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:43,790
I am that problem.

229
00:14:48,970 --> 00:14:50,610
Haven't you thought about your parents?

230
00:14:55,590 --> 00:14:56,840
It's precisely because I thought about them

231
00:14:58,050 --> 00:14:59,260
that I made this decision.

232
00:15:00,910 --> 00:15:02,640
Did you have a disagreement with your family?

233
00:15:03,310 --> 00:15:04,310
You should talk it out

234
00:15:04,310 --> 00:15:05,460
and it'll be fine.

235
00:15:06,820 --> 00:15:08,270
Not everyone

236
00:15:08,550 --> 00:15:09,720
and everything

237
00:15:10,300 --> 00:15:11,820
can be resolved through talking.

238
00:15:20,590 --> 00:15:22,920
Sometimes communicating with parents

239
00:15:24,490 --> 00:15:26,890
is even more difficult than with strangers.

240
00:15:29,480 --> 00:15:31,070
We all have our own lives.

241
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,510
I don't want to disappoint my parents either,

242
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:35,510
so I decided

243
00:15:36,080 --> 00:15:36,940
to come here and die.

244
00:15:39,070 --> 00:15:40,340
If I really die,

245
00:15:41,450 --> 00:15:42,310
I hope they

246
00:15:42,350 --> 00:15:43,300
can come to terms with it.

247
00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:45,620
I don't want them to feel it's their fault.

248
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:50,470
From what you're saying,

249
00:15:51,750 --> 00:15:52,900
you've already written a suicide note?

250
00:15:55,170 --> 00:15:56,020
It's in my bag.

251
00:16:01,260 --> 00:16:02,130
It's a pity though.

252
00:16:03,400 --> 00:16:05,670
I didn't expect even dying to be this difficult.

253
00:16:10,970 --> 00:16:12,400
I'm afraid of heights too.

254
00:16:16,840 --> 00:16:17,920
Do you have any

255
00:16:17,960 --> 00:16:18,860
other methods

256
00:16:20,190 --> 00:16:22,260
that are quick and clean?

257
00:16:24,030 --> 00:16:24,700
No.

258
00:16:26,230 --> 00:16:27,470
How can that be?

259
00:16:27,490 --> 00:16:29,220
Isn't this Suicide Valley?

260
00:16:33,940 --> 00:16:34,980
Please.

261
00:16:37,970 --> 00:16:38,910
Can you

262
00:16:39,910 --> 00:16:40,660
help me?

263
00:16:42,670 --> 00:16:43,600
You really want to die?

264
00:16:48,630 --> 00:16:49,710
I have a cleaver.

265
00:16:49,790 --> 00:16:50,720
It's freshly sharpened.

266
00:16:50,750 --> 00:16:51,670
You could try that.

267
00:16:57,710 --> 00:16:58,430
That won't do.

268
00:17:00,180 --> 00:17:01,390
That cleaver is yours.

269
00:17:02,290 --> 00:17:03,690
I can't cause you trouble.

270
00:17:09,290 --> 00:17:10,540
Then why don't you jump into the lake?

271
00:17:23,700 --> 00:17:24,550
That's a good idea.

272
00:17:25,810 --> 00:17:26,869
So I helped her

273
00:17:26,910 --> 00:17:28,060
fulfill this wish.

274
00:17:29,110 --> 00:17:29,870
After all, I've already

275
00:17:29,870 --> 00:17:30,790
killed one person.

276
00:17:31,420 --> 00:17:32,590
One more didn't matter.

277
00:17:39,990 --> 00:17:41,110
From Chang Feng's selection criteria,

278
00:17:41,130 --> 00:17:42,160
we can see that

279
00:17:42,270 --> 00:17:42,830
he's not someone who

280
00:17:42,870 --> 00:17:43,840
kills indiscriminately.

281
00:17:43,970 --> 00:17:44,450
(Beijiang Public Security Bureau)

282
00:17:44,450 --> 00:17:45,070
He admitted to
(Beijiang Public Security Bureau)

283
00:17:45,070 --> 00:17:45,110
(Beijiang Public Security Bureau)

284
00:17:45,110 --> 00:17:46,070
killing Jing so quickly.
(Beijiang Public Security Bureau)

285
00:17:46,350 --> 00:17:46,950
There's no explanation.

286
00:17:49,710 --> 00:17:50,420
Jiang Feng,

287
00:17:50,910 --> 00:17:51,790
notify the salvage team

288
00:17:51,990 --> 00:17:53,410
to expand the search area

289
00:17:53,710 --> 00:17:54,590
in the area Chang Feng indicated.

290
00:17:54,630 --> 00:17:55,100
Okay.

291
00:17:57,990 --> 00:17:59,360
Why would he do this?

292
00:18:02,020 --> 00:18:02,790
Captain Cheng.

293
00:18:04,150 --> 00:18:05,480
Zhang Sijing's phone data

294
00:18:05,500 --> 00:18:06,190
has been recovered.

295
00:18:06,710 --> 00:18:07,800
The last call

296
00:18:07,860 --> 00:18:08,510
was made to a girl named

297
00:18:08,510 --> 00:18:09,540
Liu Xinyao.

298
00:18:11,320 --> 00:18:12,030
I checked

299
00:18:12,030 --> 00:18:13,110
their social media accounts.

300
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:14,880
They both posted photos with each other.

301
00:18:14,930 --> 00:18:16,330
They should be friends.

302
00:18:17,530 --> 00:18:18,350
This Liu Xinyao

303
00:18:18,350 --> 00:18:19,570
runs a coffee shop

304
00:18:20,190 --> 00:18:20,950
right here in the city.

305
00:18:24,420 --> 00:18:25,710
(Say hello to yourself every day)

306
00:18:27,630 --> 00:18:28,210
Thank you.

307
00:18:29,010 --> 00:18:29,700
Thanks.

308
00:18:34,030 --> 00:18:35,670
Has Jing been found?

309
00:18:41,350 --> 00:18:42,070
Not yet,

310
00:18:42,300 --> 00:18:44,560
but we discovered that before she disappeared,

311
00:18:45,110 --> 00:18:46,140
she received a call.

312
00:18:46,670 --> 00:18:47,650
It was from you.

313
00:18:49,350 --> 00:18:50,070
So we wanted to ask you

314
00:18:50,110 --> 00:18:51,350
about the situation.

315
00:18:52,190 --> 00:18:54,320
That day, her parents came to see me,

316
00:18:54,870 --> 00:18:56,690
asking if I knew where she was.

317
00:18:57,550 --> 00:18:59,120
They seemed quite anxious.

318
00:18:59,910 --> 00:19:01,190
I called her several times,

319
00:19:01,210 --> 00:19:02,370
but her phone was off.

320
00:19:03,390 --> 00:19:05,440
I thought she was grounded again.

321
00:19:05,990 --> 00:19:07,750
Jing often argued with her parents

322
00:19:08,870 --> 00:19:09,630
and got grounded?

323
00:19:09,990 --> 00:19:11,780
Her parents are very strict,

324
00:19:12,750 --> 00:19:14,310
controlling what she eats,

325
00:19:14,350 --> 00:19:15,530
what she wears,

326
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,350
what job she takes,

327
00:19:17,710 --> 00:19:18,910
and who she befriends.

328
00:19:19,910 --> 00:19:20,630
Well,

329
00:19:22,310 --> 00:19:22,910
do you know if

330
00:19:22,910 --> 00:19:23,920
she had any recent conflicts

331
00:19:23,990 --> 00:19:24,950
with her parents?

332
00:19:26,030 --> 00:19:27,000
Recently, her parents have been

333
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,110
asking people everywhere

334
00:19:28,140 --> 00:19:29,790
to set her up on blind dates.

335
00:19:30,430 --> 00:19:31,510
Every time they arranged one,

336
00:19:31,550 --> 00:19:32,830
it would lead to a big argument

337
00:19:34,070 --> 00:19:35,970
and Jing could only escape to my place.

338
00:19:36,350 --> 00:19:37,950
Her parents even filed a missing person report,

339
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,250
saying she had disappeared.

340
00:19:39,710 --> 00:19:41,000
Jing came to my shop that day

341
00:19:41,030 --> 00:19:42,550
and cried for over two hours.

342
00:19:42,950 --> 00:19:44,490
In the end, she still went back home.

343
00:19:49,590 --> 00:19:50,350
Officer,

344
00:19:50,390 --> 00:19:52,030
we're all grown adults now.

345
00:19:52,390 --> 00:19:54,270
To still be controlled by parents like this,

346
00:19:54,710 --> 00:19:56,110
don't you think it's terrifying?

347
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:01,990
What exactly happened to Jing?

348
00:20:07,230 --> 00:20:08,970
We haven't found her whereabouts yet.

349
00:20:20,310 --> 00:20:22,660
Actually, Jing has been a bit depressed.

350
00:20:24,590 --> 00:20:25,710
If only I had

351
00:20:25,730 --> 00:20:27,190
tried to persuade her more,

352
00:20:27,230 --> 00:20:28,660
she wouldn't have...

353
00:20:35,350 --> 00:20:36,030
I'm sorry.

354
00:20:47,070 --> 00:20:48,110
Is this you?

355
00:20:51,590 --> 00:20:52,160
Yes.

356
00:20:52,670 --> 00:20:54,200
My friend and I.

357
00:21:16,270 --> 00:21:17,770
White sofa, white carpet.

358
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:19,470
Probably a clean freak.

359
00:21:29,020 --> 00:21:30,140
Hello.

360
00:21:30,900 --> 00:21:32,510
Are you here with

361
00:21:32,810 --> 00:21:34,700
good news or...

362
00:21:35,530 --> 00:21:36,580
We're still investigating.

363
00:21:37,430 --> 00:21:39,020
We'd like to learn more

364
00:21:39,060 --> 00:21:40,410
about Jing from you two.

365
00:21:41,330 --> 00:21:42,240
Please, come in.

366
00:21:43,800 --> 00:21:44,540
Come in.

367
00:21:45,070 --> 00:21:45,930
Zhang,

368
00:21:45,990 --> 00:21:46,710
come down.

369
00:21:46,780 --> 00:21:47,950
The police are here.

370
00:21:50,710 --> 00:21:51,110
Coming.

371
00:21:51,140 --> 00:21:51,850
-Come in.
-Have a seat.

372
00:21:51,920 --> 00:21:52,400
Alright.

373
00:21:54,110 --> 00:21:54,900
Your home's interior design

374
00:21:54,950 --> 00:21:55,670
is quite unique.

375
00:21:57,910 --> 00:21:59,070
Yes, my wife

376
00:21:59,230 --> 00:22:00,710
runs a design company.

377
00:22:01,150 --> 00:22:01,920
So

378
00:22:02,100 --> 00:22:03,680
when it comes to the room's furnishings,

379
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:05,230
she might be obsessive

380
00:22:05,430 --> 00:22:07,590
to a certain degree.

381
00:22:07,620 --> 00:22:08,870
That's not obsession.

382
00:22:09,060 --> 00:22:10,850
Ignoring

383
00:22:10,950 --> 00:22:11,900
achievable perfection

384
00:22:11,940 --> 00:22:13,480
is shameful.

385
00:22:14,040 --> 00:22:14,910
-Have some water.
-Thank you.

386
00:22:16,710 --> 00:22:18,430
What about Jing's personal space?

387
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:20,060
Is it the same?

388
00:22:22,310 --> 00:22:23,930
Well,

389
00:22:24,870 --> 00:22:25,740
Jing

390
00:22:27,010 --> 00:22:28,450
is completely different from us.

391
00:22:29,510 --> 00:22:30,490
Her room

392
00:22:30,550 --> 00:22:32,050
is always a mess.

393
00:22:32,430 --> 00:22:33,730
Her mother and I

394
00:22:33,830 --> 00:22:35,750
often help her tidy up.

395
00:22:35,870 --> 00:22:36,700
But whenever we do,

396
00:22:37,110 --> 00:22:38,020
she gets angry.

397
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:38,960
Yes,

398
00:22:39,030 --> 00:22:40,690
she gets angry whenever we clean it.

399
00:22:43,530 --> 00:22:44,970
Can I take a look at her room?

400
00:22:45,610 --> 00:22:46,390
Sure.

401
00:22:46,780 --> 00:22:48,310
It's the room upstairs.

402
00:22:48,510 --> 00:22:49,110
Okay.

403
00:23:00,380 --> 00:23:02,080
(Self-Healing)

404
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:03,980
(For the Light of Others)

405
00:23:59,480 --> 00:24:02,420
(The Moon and Sixpence)

406
00:24:08,800 --> 00:24:10,010
The main reason we're here

407
00:24:10,630 --> 00:24:12,390
is to understand

408
00:24:12,660 --> 00:24:13,960
the specific reasons

409
00:24:13,990 --> 00:24:14,670
for Jing's running away from home.

410
00:24:15,230 --> 00:24:16,660
Well, specifically...

411
00:24:18,780 --> 00:24:20,250
We learned from

412
00:24:20,390 --> 00:24:21,780
one of her friends

413
00:24:21,910 --> 00:24:23,520
that Jing's relationship with you two

414
00:24:24,230 --> 00:24:25,110
isn't very good.

415
00:24:25,790 --> 00:24:27,020
Jing's friend?

416
00:24:29,950 --> 00:24:31,650
Must be that Liu Xinyao.

417
00:24:31,710 --> 00:24:32,580
Exactly.

418
00:24:32,620 --> 00:24:34,630
That kid is also a weirdo.

419
00:24:34,830 --> 00:24:35,550
Leaving behind

420
00:24:35,550 --> 00:24:37,120
a perfectly good factory job at home,

421
00:24:37,230 --> 00:24:38,920
she insists on running some coffee shop.

422
00:24:39,750 --> 00:24:40,590
One day, I passed by

423
00:24:40,630 --> 00:24:41,430
that coffee shop

424
00:24:41,470 --> 00:24:42,820
and saw her smoking at the entrance.

425
00:24:43,470 --> 00:24:44,910
What decent girl smokes?

426
00:24:45,110 --> 00:24:45,830
Exactly.

427
00:24:46,150 --> 00:24:47,150
Our Jing

428
00:24:47,550 --> 00:24:48,910
must have been led astray by her.

429
00:24:49,950 --> 00:24:50,710
How do you know

430
00:24:50,750 --> 00:24:51,670
that Jing smokes?

431
00:24:53,110 --> 00:24:53,830
I found a lighter

432
00:24:53,870 --> 00:24:55,550
and cigarettes in her bag.

433
00:24:55,750 --> 00:24:57,590
This child is really out of line.

434
00:24:59,150 --> 00:25:00,520
I know she's grown up now

435
00:25:00,590 --> 00:25:02,070
and it's not appropriate for me to go through her bag,

436
00:25:02,430 --> 00:25:03,150
but tell me,

437
00:25:03,190 --> 00:25:04,340
how could I not check?

438
00:25:05,470 --> 00:25:06,270
You have no idea

439
00:25:06,350 --> 00:25:07,850
how terrifying this child's thoughts are.

440
00:25:08,470 --> 00:25:09,560
I told her,

441
00:25:09,750 --> 00:25:10,270
"Jing,

442
00:25:10,270 --> 00:25:11,190
while you're still young,

443
00:25:11,230 --> 00:25:12,110
hurry up and find someone,

444
00:25:12,150 --> 00:25:13,440
get married and have children.

445
00:25:14,070 --> 00:25:15,030
When you reach menopause

446
00:25:15,030 --> 00:25:16,350
and want children but can't have them,

447
00:25:16,430 --> 00:25:17,900
it'll be too late."

448
00:25:18,230 --> 00:25:19,290
Guess what she said?

449
00:25:19,740 --> 00:25:20,470
"I can have kids

450
00:25:20,510 --> 00:25:21,500
without getting married.

451
00:25:21,750 --> 00:25:22,510
In the future,

452
00:25:22,510 --> 00:25:23,900
I'll just go to a sperm bank

453
00:25:24,030 --> 00:25:26,070
and find some excellent genes

454
00:25:26,150 --> 00:25:27,830
to have a test-tube baby."

455
00:25:28,830 --> 00:25:30,280
Isn't that crazy?

456
00:25:30,510 --> 00:25:31,350
These kids nowadays,

457
00:25:31,430 --> 00:25:32,070
why are

458
00:25:32,390 --> 00:25:33,790
their thoughts so abnormal?

459
00:25:38,630 --> 00:25:40,210
We've got a basic understanding of the situation.

460
00:25:40,950 --> 00:25:41,550
If there's any news,

461
00:25:41,590 --> 00:25:42,150
we'll notify you

462
00:25:42,190 --> 00:25:42,990
immediately.

463
00:25:43,750 --> 00:25:44,390
Let's go.

464
00:25:56,550 --> 00:25:57,350
Hello, Xiaowu.

465
00:25:57,470 --> 00:25:58,110
Hello.

466
00:25:58,940 --> 00:25:59,900
Turn off the music.

467
00:26:00,670 --> 00:26:02,230
The music has been turned off.

468
00:26:04,390 --> 00:26:05,380
What are you thinking about?

469
00:26:07,230 --> 00:26:08,510
I saw a

470
00:26:08,550 --> 00:26:09,230
very worn copy of

471
00:26:09,230 --> 00:26:10,070
"The Moon and Sixpence"

472
00:26:10,110 --> 00:26:11,490
on Jing's bedside table.

473
00:26:11,830 --> 00:26:13,720
It must be a book she loves to read.

474
00:26:15,230 --> 00:26:16,160
I've read that too.

475
00:26:17,790 --> 00:26:19,010
The book is about

476
00:26:19,340 --> 00:26:20,350
the protagonist giving up

477
00:26:20,390 --> 00:26:21,570
his original life,

478
00:26:21,670 --> 00:26:23,640
abandoning his family and career.

479
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:25,280
For the pursuit of art,

480
00:26:25,310 --> 00:26:26,800
he runs off to a primitive island

481
00:26:26,830 --> 00:26:27,910
to paint alone.

482
00:26:29,700 --> 00:26:30,570
Not bad.

483
00:26:31,950 --> 00:26:32,990
Then, do you know

484
00:26:33,790 --> 00:26:35,570
who the protagonist

485
00:26:35,630 --> 00:26:36,830
in this book is based on?

486
00:26:39,740 --> 00:26:40,500
Gauguin?

487
00:26:44,210 --> 00:26:45,500
Your interpretation is spot on.

488
00:26:46,230 --> 00:26:47,350
Do you know that

489
00:26:48,100 --> 00:26:49,940
there are only two paintings

490
00:26:50,300 --> 00:26:51,720
hung up in Liu Xinyao's coffee shop

491
00:26:52,090 --> 00:26:53,090
and both are by Gauguin?

492
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:55,620
One is called

493
00:26:55,750 --> 00:26:57,060
"Where Do We Come From?

494
00:26:57,090 --> 00:26:58,040
What Are We?

495
00:26:58,250 --> 00:26:59,590
Where Are We Going?"

496
00:26:59,910 --> 00:27:01,150
The other is called

497
00:27:01,940 --> 00:27:03,590
"Spirit of the Dead Watching."

498
00:27:04,660 --> 00:27:05,880
This painting symbolizes

499
00:27:05,910 --> 00:27:07,970
people's inner struggles and fears.

500
00:27:08,510 --> 00:27:10,490
Not just the fear of death,

501
00:27:11,020 --> 00:27:12,610
but more so the fear of the unknown,

502
00:27:13,580 --> 00:27:14,600
just like how Gauguin wanted to

503
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:15,830
escape his own life,

504
00:27:16,140 --> 00:27:16,990
attempting to find

505
00:27:17,030 --> 00:27:17,870
release in a

506
00:27:17,890 --> 00:27:19,240
completely new environment.

507
00:27:19,550 --> 00:27:20,740
And these two paintings

508
00:27:21,470 --> 00:27:23,330
form a kind of dialogue,

509
00:27:23,740 --> 00:27:25,770
hinting at the complexity of Jing's inner world.

510
00:27:26,160 --> 00:27:26,870
On one hand,

511
00:27:26,910 --> 00:27:28,530
it's her questioning the meaning of life.

512
00:27:28,870 --> 00:27:29,980
On the other hand,

513
00:27:30,490 --> 00:27:31,600
it's her facing fear

514
00:27:31,620 --> 00:27:32,710
and wanting to escape.

515
00:27:33,150 --> 00:27:34,140
Therefore,

516
00:27:35,070 --> 00:27:36,030
I believe Jing

517
00:27:36,070 --> 00:27:37,540
didn't really want to seek death.

518
00:27:38,300 --> 00:27:39,310
She just wanted to try

519
00:27:39,350 --> 00:27:40,310
a completely new way of living.

520
00:27:45,590 --> 00:27:46,460
So,

521
00:27:47,310 --> 00:27:47,910
what else do you know

522
00:27:47,910 --> 00:27:48,910
about Gauguin's story?

523
00:27:50,950 --> 00:27:52,110
Gauguin?

524
00:27:53,150 --> 00:27:54,210
He must be very tall, right?

525
00:27:58,230 --> 00:27:59,000
Yeah.

526
00:27:59,430 --> 00:28:00,150
Just like you.

527
00:28:09,350 --> 00:28:10,270
It's right down there.

528
00:28:10,310 --> 00:28:11,500
When we pulled it up just now,

529
00:28:11,500 --> 00:28:12,590
it was tangled in tree branches.

530
00:28:38,630 --> 00:28:40,470
Jing!

531
00:28:41,080 --> 00:28:41,920
Jing!

532
00:28:42,350 --> 00:28:43,190
Get out of the way!

533
00:28:43,230 --> 00:28:44,500
That's my child!

534
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:45,530
Move aside!

535
00:28:45,550 --> 00:28:46,510
Move!

536
00:28:46,510 --> 00:28:47,910
-Jing.
-Jing.

537
00:28:56,580 --> 00:28:57,260
Speak.

538
00:28:57,280 --> 00:28:58,150
Captain Cheng,

539
00:28:58,600 --> 00:29:00,180
we pulled up a scarecrow.

540
00:29:01,960 --> 00:29:03,060
What do you mean?

541
00:29:03,530 --> 00:29:04,460
A scarecrow?

542
00:29:04,650 --> 00:29:05,240
Yes.

543
00:29:05,370 --> 00:29:06,350
We've already had Jing's parents

544
00:29:06,350 --> 00:29:07,260
confirm it.

545
00:29:07,460 --> 00:29:08,560
The clothes on the scarecrow,

546
00:29:08,590 --> 00:29:09,320
the sneakers,

547
00:29:09,350 --> 00:29:10,590
and the backpack all belong to Jing.

548
00:29:11,400 --> 00:29:12,190
Do you think

549
00:29:12,280 --> 00:29:13,400
we should continue searching?

550
00:29:15,900 --> 00:29:16,830
Continue.

551
00:29:22,520 --> 00:29:23,270
Li Han.

552
00:29:24,070 --> 00:29:24,750
Captain Cheng.

553
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:26,100
Take some people and go back

554
00:29:26,100 --> 00:29:27,110
to do a thorough search of the villages

555
00:29:27,110 --> 00:29:27,790
near Chang Feng's house.

556
00:29:27,810 --> 00:29:28,540
See if anyone

557
00:29:28,590 --> 00:29:29,270
has seen Zhang Sijing.

558
00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:29,950
Yes.

559
00:29:35,700 --> 00:29:36,510
Sir,

560
00:29:36,750 --> 00:29:38,100
could you please take a look

561
00:29:38,150 --> 00:29:38,870
and tell me if you've seen

562
00:29:38,870 --> 00:29:39,950
this girl recently?

563
00:29:41,530 --> 00:29:42,610
Oh, this girl?

564
00:29:42,870 --> 00:29:43,640
Yeah, a while back,

565
00:29:43,670 --> 00:29:44,510
she took a ride in my car.

566
00:29:45,020 --> 00:29:45,970
She rode in your car?

567
00:29:45,980 --> 00:29:46,430
Yes.

568
00:29:46,860 --> 00:29:48,430
This girl was quite strange.

569
00:29:48,530 --> 00:29:49,890
She said she was tired of walking

570
00:29:49,920 --> 00:29:50,960
and wanted to ride in my car.

571
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:52,650
She didn't care where we went.

572
00:29:52,930 --> 00:29:54,440
You know, I'm just trying to do business,

573
00:29:54,460 --> 00:29:55,680
so I didn't really want to take her.

574
00:29:55,950 --> 00:29:56,670
But then she pulled out

575
00:29:56,710 --> 00:29:57,670
200 yuan in cash for me.

576
00:29:57,770 --> 00:29:59,160
Nowadays, what kind of young person

577
00:29:59,190 --> 00:30:00,530
uses cash anymore?

578
00:30:01,370 --> 00:30:03,470
Could you take us

579
00:30:03,680 --> 00:30:05,470
to where she got off?

580
00:30:10,040 --> 00:30:11,190
We found a village market

581
00:30:11,240 --> 00:30:12,270
downstream.

582
00:30:12,610 --> 00:30:14,570
We saw Zhang Sijing in the surveillance footage.

583
00:30:16,380 --> 00:30:17,350
This is her.

584
00:30:19,670 --> 00:30:20,750
But there aren't many cameras in the market.

But there aren't many cameras in the market.

586
00:30:21,940 --> 00:30:23,150
Jing walked out of frame

587
00:30:23,190 --> 00:30:23,950
and disappeared.

588
00:30:24,070 --> 00:30:25,710
We've checked the market

589
00:30:25,710 --> 00:30:26,470

This is the only camera

596
00:30:32,200 --> 00:30:32,860
that captured her.

597
00:30:33,020 --> 00:30:34,070
Bring up the last frame

598
00:30:34,100 --> 00:30:34,870

Stop.

603
00:31:01,630 --> 00:31:03,080
She's wearing a baseball cap.

604
00:31:03,240 --> 00:31:04,490
Her face is unclear.

605
00:31:05,630 --> 00:31:06,530

Jing.

629

and go over there, okay?

630

We're not here to persuade you to go back.

635
00:33:05,530 --> 00:33:06,780
Then why are you here?

So now you're the new and improved Jing?

641
00:33:23,240 --> 00:33:24,270
we can rest easy.

642
00:33:25,410 --> 00:33:26,460
But your parents

643
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:27,870
are very worried about you.

644
00:33:29,400 --> 00:33:30,780
I don't want to see them.

645
00:33:36,120 --> 00:33:37,140
I understand you.

646
00:33:38,500 --> 00:33:40,350
Living with misunderstanding and prejudice

647
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:41,980
is quite painful,

648
00:33:43,250 --> 00:33:45,520
especially when it's from your closest family.

649
00:33:45,840 --> 00:33:46,440
Right?

650

After what's happened,

652
00:33:54,180 --> 00:33:55,710
I think they will change.

653
00:33:58,630 --> 00:34:00,030
Give them some time

654
00:34:00,940 --> 00:34:02,430
and give yourself a chance too.

655

00:34:15,190 --> 00:34:16,219
why don't you

657
00:34:16,860 --> 00:34:18,500
go tell Chang Feng

658
00:34:18,830 --> 00:34:19,800
that everything's okay?

659
00:34:21,270 --> 00:34:22,270

660
00:34:24,280 --> 00:34:25,270

He's been arrested.

662
00:34:32,400 --> 00:34:33,780
He didn't do anything.

663
00:34:34,270 --> 00:34:35,270
He just helped me

664
00:34:35,310 --> 00:34:36,370
throw away a scarecrow.

665
00:35:03,940 --> 00:35:05,440
You've already died once.

666
00:35:08,950 --> 00:35:10,020
From now on,

667
00:35:11,650 --> 00:35:13,090
you can have a new life.

668
00:35:14,820 --> 00:35:15,760
But I...

669
00:35:17,620 --> 00:35:19,300
don't know where to go.

670
00:35:23,620 --> 00:35:25,170
Go wherever you want.

671
00:35:26,170 --> 00:35:27,070
Go to a place where

672
00:35:27,070 --> 00:35:27,950
no one knows you.

673
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:31,190
The villagers know

674
00:35:31,190 --> 00:35:32,670
I asked you to be my guide.

675
00:35:34,530 --> 00:35:36,510
If I just disappear like this

676
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:38,480
and go missing,

677
00:35:38,610 --> 00:35:40,120
it will cause trouble for you.

678
00:35:41,830 --> 00:35:43,540
Let me exchange a secret with you.

679
00:35:48,510 --> 00:35:49,750
I've been keeping this to myself

680
00:35:49,750 --> 00:35:50,390
for a long time.

681
00:35:50,940 --> 00:35:52,210
I want to tell someone about it.

682
00:35:56,200 --> 00:35:56,880
Go ahead.

683
00:36:01,630 --> 00:36:02,590
I've killed someone before.

684
00:36:06,570 --> 00:36:08,070
So I don't mind adding you to the list.

685
00:36:11,350 --> 00:36:12,850
If the police come looking for you,

686
00:36:15,630 --> 00:36:16,680
all the answers

687
00:36:16,710 --> 00:36:18,390
will be found with me.

688
00:36:23,940 --> 00:36:25,880
Suicide is very painful

689
00:36:26,710 --> 00:36:28,060
for family members.

690
00:36:29,940 --> 00:36:31,000
Without any hope,

691
00:36:32,310 --> 00:36:32,990
your family

692
00:36:33,030 --> 00:36:34,310
won't blame themselves for it.

693
00:36:37,050 --> 00:36:38,000
Otherwise, they'll live

694
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:38,910
with guilt forever.

695
00:36:40,770 --> 00:36:41,770
It's too painful.

696
00:36:48,050 --> 00:36:49,370
Will I

697
00:36:52,060 --> 00:36:53,430
be able to see you again in the future?

698
00:36:56,780 --> 00:36:57,560
Not necessarily.

699
00:37:01,670 --> 00:37:02,670
Anyway, I don't have

700
00:37:02,670 --> 00:37:03,710
much to live for anymore.

701
00:37:04,560 --> 00:37:06,280
Just live well for me.

702
00:37:07,500 --> 00:37:09,530
He gave me a second life.

703
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:17,030
Can I

704
00:37:18,290 --> 00:37:20,430
do something for him?

705
00:37:23,850 --> 00:37:24,930
You've already helped him.

706
00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:26,810
You saved him.

707
00:37:30,190 --> 00:37:30,930
He...

708
00:37:31,260 --> 00:37:32,870
He's the one who saved me.

709
00:37:36,510 --> 00:37:37,460
You lied.

710
00:37:42,060 --> 00:37:43,670
You didn't kill Zhang Sijing.

711
00:37:58,390 --> 00:37:59,760
She looks good

712
00:38:00,860 --> 00:38:02,000
with short hair too.

713
00:38:02,750 --> 00:38:04,280
After she left you,

714
00:38:04,790 --> 00:38:06,030
she hitchhiked to the market

715
00:38:06,050 --> 00:38:06,870
and cut it herself.

716
00:38:07,620 --> 00:38:09,660
I can't believe you actually found her.

717
00:38:12,760 --> 00:38:14,090
She doesn't want to go home.

718
00:38:15,610 --> 00:38:17,030
You're not going to send her back, are you?

719
00:38:17,030 --> 00:38:17,930
Please don't.

720
00:38:17,990 --> 00:38:19,030
Whether she goes home or not

721
00:38:19,350 --> 00:38:20,700
isn't up to anyone else.

722
00:38:21,880 --> 00:38:23,170
The decision is hers alone.

723
00:38:23,960 --> 00:38:25,180
After this incident,

724
00:38:27,200 --> 00:38:28,990
I believe her parents will change as well.

725
00:38:30,540 --> 00:38:31,350
That's good.

726
00:38:31,860 --> 00:38:32,550
That's good.

727
00:38:33,990 --> 00:38:34,590
Oh, right.

728
00:38:35,360 --> 00:38:36,550
Jing told me

729
00:38:37,430 --> 00:38:38,550
to thank you for saving her.

730
00:38:40,330 --> 00:38:41,720
I saved the mountaineering team.

731
00:38:43,860 --> 00:38:45,720
The price was losing my sister.

732
00:38:47,340 --> 00:38:49,010
I changed their fate,

733
00:38:49,630 --> 00:38:51,360
and they changed mine.

734
00:38:55,940 --> 00:38:58,030
If I hadn't saved them back then,

735
00:39:00,690 --> 00:39:02,430
there wouldn't have been so many lives

736
00:39:03,930 --> 00:39:04,950
lost.

737
00:39:06,500 --> 00:39:07,910
Fighting evil with evil,

738
00:39:08,750 --> 00:39:09,910
only to find out in the end

739
00:39:10,780 --> 00:39:12,190
that you're punishing yourself.

740
00:39:15,230 --> 00:39:16,630
But it's good that your heart

741
00:39:17,550 --> 00:39:19,170
hasn't been completely consumed by evil.

742
00:39:21,090 --> 00:39:22,150
In the end, your soul

743
00:39:22,150 --> 00:39:23,310
can still be redeemed.

744
00:39:30,460 --> 00:39:31,630

Who was it?

It was a Mr. Fang.

He made a good offer.

754
00:40:31,160 --> 00:40:32,590
And he said he's a fan of yours.

I'm sorry,

I was actually

757
00:40:35,150 --> 00:40:35,910
planning to take that painting back.

758
00:40:36,590 --> 00:40:37,230
So, then...

759
00:40:37,320 --> 00:40:38,450
No, it's fine.

You're the one who bought my painting.

766
00:41:28,160 --> 00:41:28,790
Have a seat,

767
00:41:29,910 --> 00:41:30,740
Mr. Shen.

768
00:41:42,540 --> 00:41:43,900
"Restless Still Life."

769
00:41:47,280 --> 00:41:48,210
I bought it.

770
00:41:52,920 --> 00:41:53,600
Why?

771
00:41:56,240 --> 00:41:57,640
When we talked last time,

772
00:41:58,320 --> 00:41:59,450
this painting

773
00:41:59,750 --> 00:42:00,440
didn't seem like

774
00:42:00,470 --> 00:42:01,310
something you would like.

775
00:42:02,310 --> 00:42:03,040
Because I don't want

776
00:42:03,070 --> 00:42:03,990
anyone else to see it.

777
00:42:05,250 --> 00:42:05,980
Alright,

778
00:42:06,790 --> 00:42:07,810
then I'll take it back.

779
00:42:07,830 --> 00:42:08,880
I'll refund your money.

780
00:42:09,140 --> 00:42:10,550
It's not about the money.

781
00:42:17,410 --> 00:42:18,810
This painting

782
00:42:20,890 --> 00:42:22,550
shouldn't exist.

783
00:43:01,510 --> 00:43:03,000
You've seen my dream.

784
00:43:09,500 --> 00:43:10,790
This is also my dream.
