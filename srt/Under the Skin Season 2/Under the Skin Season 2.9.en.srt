(Under the Skin Ⅱ)

2
00:01:43,479 --> 00:01:46,110
(Episode 9)

3
00:01:56,150 --> 00:01:58,310
If you're willing,

4
00:01:58,930 --> 00:02:00,030
you can tell me about it.

5
00:02:05,180 --> 00:02:06,940
As far back as I can remember…

6
00:02:20,190 --> 00:02:20,829
It's okay.

7
00:02:21,310 --> 00:02:21,950
Take your time.

8
00:02:26,250 --> 00:02:28,090
As far back as I can remember,

9
00:02:30,950 --> 00:02:32,230
my concept of home

10
00:02:33,430 --> 00:02:35,430
was a four-bedroom apartment

11
00:02:35,470 --> 00:02:37,030
filled with clutter.

12
00:02:38,270 --> 00:02:39,020
It was crowded,

13
00:02:39,270 --> 00:02:40,110
messy,

14
00:02:40,420 --> 00:02:41,630
with no room to walk in.

15
00:02:43,579 --> 00:02:45,560
Even my bed and bathroom

16
00:02:46,110 --> 00:02:48,250
were turned into storage areas by my grandmother.

17
00:02:51,230 --> 00:02:52,329
You know what?

18
00:02:53,630 --> 00:02:55,520
My biggest wish as a child

19
00:02:55,650 --> 00:02:57,230
was to wear

20
00:02:57,300 --> 00:02:58,640
a white tulle princess dress

21
00:02:58,930 --> 00:03:00,420
and stand on the school stage.

22
00:03:03,140 --> 00:03:04,550
When I was seven,

23
00:03:05,150 --> 00:03:06,510
that wish came true.

24
00:03:09,150 --> 00:03:10,560
But below the stage,

25
00:03:12,580 --> 00:03:13,670
all the other kids

26
00:03:13,890 --> 00:03:15,750
pointed and laughed at me.

27
00:03:17,870 --> 00:03:20,350
Because that white tulle dress

28
00:03:21,750 --> 00:03:22,670
was made by my grandmother

29
00:03:22,670 --> 00:03:24,310
from an old mosquito net.

30
00:03:32,579 --> 00:03:33,380
Just like

31
00:03:35,910 --> 00:03:36,829
this Super Panda?

32
00:03:44,010 --> 00:03:46,630
I was the only one in class

33
00:03:47,010 --> 00:03:49,130
whose Super Panda was a knockoff made by my grandmother.

34
00:03:49,900 --> 00:03:50,780
From then on,

35
00:03:52,150 --> 00:03:53,590
I got a nickname.

36
00:03:57,670 --> 00:03:59,270
Trash Kid.

37
00:04:01,170 --> 00:04:02,250
This nickname

38
00:04:03,640 --> 00:04:05,550
followed me throughout my childhood.

39
00:04:08,550 --> 00:04:09,720
It was embarrassing.

40
00:04:14,590 --> 00:04:16,029
Later, when I grew up,

41
00:04:19,070 --> 00:04:21,300
I finally gathered the courage

42
00:04:21,930 --> 00:04:22,990
to go to my grandmother

43
00:04:23,030 --> 00:04:24,790
and pour out everything

44
00:04:24,830 --> 00:04:26,180
that was in my heart.

45
00:04:28,300 --> 00:04:30,290
I didn't want to blame her for anything,

46
00:04:31,550 --> 00:04:34,230
but I just didn't want to keep it bottled up inside.

47
00:04:34,750 --> 00:04:36,710
I was in so much pain.

48
00:04:37,550 --> 00:04:39,300
I wanted her to understand me.

49
00:04:42,440 --> 00:04:43,150
But in the end...

50
00:04:47,870 --> 00:04:49,430
She passed away.

51
00:04:52,470 --> 00:04:53,650
Lying on that

52
00:04:55,190 --> 00:04:56,630
old wooden bed

53
00:04:56,670 --> 00:04:58,030
piled high with junk.

54
00:05:09,910 --> 00:05:11,690
She never woke up again.

55
00:05:16,910 --> 00:05:19,440
After she passed away, we discovered

56
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:21,850
that she had left our family

57
00:05:22,430 --> 00:05:24,990
a room full of old cardboard boxes,

58
00:05:26,790 --> 00:05:28,430
but she'd donated all her savings

59
00:05:30,470 --> 00:05:32,570
to a charity school.

60
00:05:37,909 --> 00:05:38,950
Mr. Shen,

61
00:05:41,570 --> 00:05:42,470
tell me,

62
00:05:42,470 --> 00:05:43,630
how can I complain about her?

63
00:05:45,580 --> 00:05:47,350
Complain about why she was so selfless

64
00:05:47,390 --> 00:05:48,350
and kind?

65
00:05:53,550 --> 00:05:54,710
I actually know that Jiang Feng

66
00:05:54,750 --> 00:05:55,920
is interested in me.

67
00:05:56,360 --> 00:05:57,900
But sometimes when I see him,

68
00:05:57,990 --> 00:05:59,670
I feel really insecure.

69
00:06:01,390 --> 00:06:03,200
He has a loving family,

70
00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:04,620
a warm home.

71
00:06:04,710 --> 00:06:06,350
All the kids are eager

72
00:06:06,350 --> 00:06:07,150
to be his friend.

73
00:06:07,170 --> 00:06:08,250
But what about me?

74
00:06:09,620 --> 00:06:11,260
I really can't bring myself to say it.

75
00:06:15,490 --> 00:06:16,520
I understand how you feel.

76
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:22,290
When you were young,

77
00:06:24,030 --> 00:06:25,600
the pain your grandmother caused you

78
00:06:28,870 --> 00:06:30,390
was like a room

79
00:06:32,830 --> 00:06:34,350
slowly filling with floodwater.

80
00:06:35,659 --> 00:06:37,370
But your grandmother's greatness

81
00:06:38,430 --> 00:06:40,290
was like an invisible force

82
00:06:41,700 --> 00:06:43,230
that tightly sealed

83
00:06:43,230 --> 00:06:45,300
all the doors and windows of that room.

84
00:06:49,030 --> 00:06:50,630
The flood couldn't pour out.

85
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:55,270
It could only accumulate more and more,

86
00:06:57,070 --> 00:06:58,130
more and more,

87
00:06:59,590 --> 00:07:00,550
until finally,

88
00:07:03,190 --> 00:07:04,910
even you couldn't bear it anymore.

89
00:07:12,150 --> 00:07:13,550
You've been through a lot these years, Li Han.

90
00:07:25,630 --> 00:07:26,800
Why have I

91
00:07:26,830 --> 00:07:28,750
become like this now?

92
00:07:30,280 --> 00:07:32,630
I don't like who I've become,

93
00:07:32,670 --> 00:07:34,310
but I just can't control it.

94
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:35,909
I don't know

95
00:07:35,950 --> 00:07:37,270
if that da Vinci was right

96
00:07:37,270 --> 00:07:38,040
or not.

97
00:07:38,110 --> 00:07:39,830
Is it really because of genes?

98
00:07:40,510 --> 00:07:41,110
But

99
00:07:42,150 --> 00:07:44,480
I'm really scared.

100
00:07:46,030 --> 00:07:48,290
I don't want to become like my grandmother.

101
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:52,640
No matter what,

102
00:07:56,380 --> 00:07:57,220
you can finally

103
00:07:57,220 --> 00:07:58,060
say it out loud now.

104
00:08:00,550 --> 00:08:01,520
Don't you feel better?

105
00:08:09,030 --> 00:08:10,130
How about

106
00:08:11,070 --> 00:08:12,220
we go out for a walk,

107
00:08:13,030 --> 00:08:13,980
get something to eat,

108
00:08:14,410 --> 00:08:15,470
and clear your mind?

109
00:08:25,750 --> 00:08:26,950
Your meal is served.

110
00:08:26,990 --> 00:08:27,510
Please enjoy your meal.

111
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:27,610
Thank you.

112
00:08:27,610 --> 00:08:28,130
(Pizza Hut)
Thank you.

113
00:08:28,130 --> 00:08:29,060

114
00:08:29,060 --> 00:08:29,910
Mr. Shen,

115
00:08:29,910 --> 00:08:30,590
(Pizza Hut)

116
00:08:30,590 --> 00:08:32,270
this meal is on me.
(Pizza Hut)

117
00:08:33,110 --> 00:08:33,900
Thanks to you,

118
00:08:33,950 --> 00:08:34,750
I was able to say

119
00:08:34,780 --> 00:08:36,510
what I've been holding in for so long.

120
00:08:36,539 --> 00:08:37,380
Let me tell you,

121
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:39,150
I'm feeling super great right now.

122
00:08:39,870 --> 00:08:40,750
That's good.

123
00:08:41,510 --> 00:08:42,419
Oh, right.

124
00:08:42,750 --> 00:08:43,530
Actually,

125
00:08:43,669 --> 00:08:44,840
I have a gift for you.

126
00:08:45,710 --> 00:08:46,430
What is it?

127
00:08:46,830 --> 00:08:47,470
Look.

128
00:08:48,270 --> 00:08:49,110
This

129
00:08:49,670 --> 00:08:51,110
is the old you

130
00:08:51,190 --> 00:08:51,830
that you mentioned.

131
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:53,680
And this one

132
00:08:54,630 --> 00:08:55,790
is the you we see,

133
00:08:56,860 --> 00:08:58,910
a confident, cheerful, and bright person

134
00:08:59,020 --> 00:08:59,950
who can arrange everything

135
00:08:59,990 --> 00:09:01,590
in perfect order.

136
00:09:02,100 --> 00:09:02,710
For you.

137
00:09:11,430 --> 00:09:13,710
What if this current me

138
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:16,150
is just a facade?

139
00:09:20,570 --> 00:09:21,980
Well, do you think

140
00:09:22,510 --> 00:09:23,690
the current you

141
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:25,630
is happy?

142
00:09:26,590 --> 00:09:27,680
Yes, I'm happy.

143
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:28,660
Every day, working with everyone

144
00:09:28,710 --> 00:09:29,940
to solve cases,

145
00:09:29,970 --> 00:09:31,210
using my abilities,

146
00:09:31,300 --> 00:09:32,960
I feel really accomplished.

147
00:09:33,150 --> 00:09:35,150
(Pizza Hut)

148
00:09:35,150 --> 00:09:36,670
This is enough to show
(Pizza Hut)

149
00:09:36,690 --> 00:09:38,090
that it's not a facade.

150
00:09:39,950 --> 00:09:41,270
And I believe

151
00:09:41,540 --> 00:09:43,080
your sense of justice when handling cases

152
00:09:44,350 --> 00:09:44,910
and your empathy

153
00:09:44,910 --> 00:09:46,270
for vulnerable groups

154
00:09:47,540 --> 00:09:48,420
are somewhat influenced

155
00:09:48,420 --> 00:09:49,970
by your grandmother,

156
00:09:50,230 --> 00:09:51,020
right?

157
00:09:52,980 --> 00:09:53,840
So,

158
00:09:54,700 --> 00:09:56,000
this current you

159
00:09:56,550 --> 00:09:58,030
is the most authentic you.

160
00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:02,670
Grandmother was a bit stubborn,

161
00:10:03,590 --> 00:10:04,470
but she also

162
00:10:05,150 --> 00:10:06,390
put her heart into giving me

163
00:10:06,710 --> 00:10:08,580
the love she most wanted to

164
00:10:08,790 --> 00:10:09,660
give me.

165
00:10:13,340 --> 00:10:14,110
Thank you.

166
00:10:14,990 --> 00:10:15,760
You're welcome.

167
00:10:16,710 --> 00:10:17,340
Come on,

168
00:10:17,930 --> 00:10:19,020
let's toast to Grandmother.

169
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:20,560
To Grandmother.

170
00:10:22,820 --> 00:10:23,870
So hot!

171
00:10:29,370 --> 00:10:31,090
This pizza is so delicious!

172
00:10:31,450 --> 00:10:32,660
Mr. Shen,

173
00:10:32,930 --> 00:10:33,890
next time,

174
00:10:33,910 --> 00:10:35,400
let's invite everyone from our department

175
00:10:35,430 --> 00:10:36,750
to come and try it.

176
00:10:49,030 --> 00:10:50,460
According to the technical team's work,

177
00:10:50,790 --> 00:10:51,940
they have detected that

178
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:52,710
yesterday, da Vinci

179
00:10:52,750 --> 00:10:53,870
added another number.

180
00:10:54,790 --> 00:10:55,820
It belongs to a young mother

181
00:10:55,870 --> 00:10:57,030
who has lost hope in life

182
00:10:57,030 --> 00:10:57,720
due to a rare disease.

183
00:10:58,390 --> 00:10:59,880
We have contacted her family

184
00:10:59,950 --> 00:11:01,110
and secured her number.

185
00:11:02,430 --> 00:11:03,070
We can't let him

186
00:11:03,070 --> 00:11:04,260
continue harming people like this.

187
00:11:04,670 --> 00:11:06,410
We need to find a way to catch him quickly.

188
00:11:08,670 --> 00:11:09,510
But now...

189
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:11,110
Let me do it.

00:11:17,910 --> 00:11:18,960
If we change the person now,

196
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:18,980
(Beijiang Criminal Investigation Team)

197
00:11:18,980 --> 00:11:20,280
it will arouse his suspicion.
(Beijiang Criminal Investigation Team)

198
00:11:20,550 --> 00:11:21,810
But you're under too much pressure.

199
00:11:21,900 --> 00:11:22,430
Right now,

200
00:11:22,470 --> 00:11:23,510
this is our only lead.

201
00:11:23,510 --> 00:11:24,870
We can't lose this lead.

202
00:11:25,450 --> 00:11:26,940
When people are stuck in a quagmire of despair,

203
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,150
wanting to save themselves

204
00:11:28,190 --> 00:11:29,600
but unable to break free,

205
00:11:29,840 --> 00:11:30,990
it's truly a fine line between

206
00:11:31,710 --> 00:11:32,760
heaven and hell.

207
00:11:33,940 --> 00:11:34,960
Yet he pushes people

208
00:11:34,990 --> 00:11:36,510
into the abyss

209
00:11:36,550 --> 00:11:37,750
when they need a lifeline the most.

210
00:11:40,530 --> 00:11:41,990
I won't let any more

211
00:11:42,030 --> 00:11:43,330
desperate people encounter him.

212
00:11:49,850 --> 00:11:51,110
I think Li Han can handle it.

213
00:11:55,020 --> 00:11:55,630
Alright,

214
00:11:56,250 --> 00:11:57,100
you continue.

215
00:11:57,980 --> 00:11:58,960
Shen Yi, stay with her.

216
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:01,440
Li Han.

217
00:12:01,590 --> 00:12:02,260
Look.

218
00:12:03,310 --> 00:12:05,010
This was found in Luo Yuchen's room.

219
00:12:06,310 --> 00:12:07,110
What do you see

220
00:12:07,150 --> 00:12:07,910
in this painting?

221
00:12:09,310 --> 00:12:11,390
There's a warm light coming from the house.

222
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:13,760
She still has love in her heart.

223
00:12:14,790 --> 00:12:15,310
Right.

224
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:17,890
Look at the house she drew.

225
00:12:18,030 --> 00:12:19,000
It's small and delicate,

226
00:12:19,390 --> 00:12:20,470
expressing a need for security

227
00:12:20,470 --> 00:12:21,440
and love.

228
00:12:23,230 --> 00:12:24,780
The door of the house is open,

229
00:12:25,310 --> 00:12:26,210
indicating

230
00:12:26,310 --> 00:12:27,240
her desire for openness

231
00:12:27,510 --> 00:12:28,690
and connection.

232
00:12:29,350 --> 00:12:30,950
The warm light shining through the windows

233
00:12:31,630 --> 00:12:32,750
suggests that inside,

234
00:12:32,910 --> 00:12:35,000
she's actually warm and welcoming.

235
00:12:36,870 --> 00:12:38,980
The slightly drooping branches

236
00:12:39,380 --> 00:12:41,510
show that she's sensitive inside

237
00:12:42,110 --> 00:12:43,510
and prone to self-deprecation.

238
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:46,350
The person standing alone next to the tree

239
00:12:46,870 --> 00:12:48,070
has beautiful eyes

240
00:12:48,430 --> 00:12:49,560
and is looking up at the tree,

241
00:12:49,910 --> 00:12:51,010
representing

242
00:12:51,110 --> 00:12:52,670
her intense desire for acceptance

243
00:12:52,700 --> 00:12:53,590
and affirmation.

244
00:12:55,580 --> 00:12:56,500
Now,

245
00:12:56,670 --> 00:12:57,480
bring up the conversation

246
00:12:57,510 --> 00:12:58,630
between her and da Vinci again.

247
00:12:58,710 --> 00:12:59,550
Let's see how

248
00:12:59,550 --> 00:13:00,390
da Vinci responded.

249
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:06,260
Your family is hypocritical.

250
00:13:06,990 --> 00:13:07,760
Your parents

251
00:13:07,790 --> 00:13:09,710
only treat you as a decorative item,

252
00:13:10,230 --> 00:13:11,470
a tool for their own prestige.

253
00:13:12,270 --> 00:13:13,630
They don't really love you at all.

254
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:16,080
They only love themselves.

255
00:13:16,950 --> 00:13:18,040
This shows...

256
00:13:18,230 --> 00:13:19,350
It shows he's forcing a narrative.

257
00:13:20,910 --> 00:13:22,150
Look at these two paintings.

258
00:13:23,990 --> 00:13:25,920
These are the two paintings on the wall of the Setting Sun.

259
00:13:27,300 --> 00:13:28,730
This one was drawn by you.

260
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:31,450
In each one,

261
00:13:31,550 --> 00:13:33,260
it seems like he's analyzing the painting,

262
00:13:33,630 --> 00:13:34,540
but in reality,

263
00:13:36,740 --> 00:13:37,310
he's just

264
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:38,500
using conversations with you

265
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:40,200
to discover your weaknesses

266
00:13:42,430 --> 00:13:43,470
and then exploit them.

267
00:13:44,380 --> 00:13:44,910
He's not

268
00:13:44,950 --> 00:13:45,910
really knowledgeable about the House-Tree-Person test.

269
00:13:47,020 --> 00:13:48,370
So what should we do now?

270
00:13:48,630 --> 00:13:49,540
Attack him.

271
00:13:50,310 --> 00:13:51,070
Say he's not

272
00:13:51,070 --> 00:13:52,460
a real psychologist.

273
00:13:55,950 --> 00:13:56,390
You're not

274
00:13:56,390 --> 00:13:57,600
a real psychologist.

275
00:13:58,070 --> 00:13:59,030
Your analysis of the House-Tree-Person test

276
00:13:59,030 --> 00:13:59,700
is all wrong.

277
00:14:00,110 --> 00:14:02,190
There's no absolute best in literature or martial arts.

278
00:14:02,510 --> 00:14:03,660
Everyone is different.

279
00:14:04,110 --> 00:14:05,270
My interpretation of drawings

280
00:14:05,910 --> 00:14:07,260
is just based on

281
00:14:07,350 --> 00:14:08,830
an analysis of relatively objective

282
00:14:08,830 --> 00:14:09,750
and professional knowledge.

283
00:14:10,270 --> 00:14:11,390
You don't have to agree,

284
00:14:12,070 --> 00:14:13,430
but there's no need to deny me.

285
00:14:14,710 --> 00:14:16,500
Haven't you been denying me all along?

286
00:14:17,470 --> 00:14:18,560
I've never denied you.

287
00:14:19,140 --> 00:14:19,950
On the contrary,

288
00:14:20,430 --> 00:14:21,770
I hope you can be calmer.

289
00:14:21,830 --> 00:14:23,140
No need to be so aggressive.

290
00:14:23,350 --> 00:14:24,080
I know

291
00:14:24,510 --> 00:14:25,690
that your anger

292
00:14:26,390 --> 00:14:27,270
is just to cover up

293
00:14:27,270 --> 00:14:28,410
your inner fear.

294
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:31,060
Don't respond to him.

295
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:32,730
Keep attacking him.

296
00:14:35,910 --> 00:14:37,120
What am I afraid of?

297
00:14:37,490 --> 00:14:38,470
You're afraid of becoming

298
00:14:38,470 --> 00:14:40,150
the person you least want to be.

299
00:14:41,670 --> 00:14:43,200
Actually, you don't need to be afraid.

300
00:14:43,830 --> 00:14:45,520
You should feel despair.

301
00:14:46,270 --> 00:14:48,150
You will definitely become your grandmother.

302
00:14:49,110 --> 00:14:50,230
It's irreversible,

303
00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:52,470
destined.

304
00:14:55,890 --> 00:14:56,640
Remember,

305
00:14:57,190 --> 00:14:58,340
there's another you.

306
00:15:01,870 --> 00:15:03,300
Make him do the House-Tree-Person test.

307
00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:11,850
Since you're so good at analyzing,

308
00:15:12,310 --> 00:15:13,940
let me analyze you too.

309
00:15:14,590 --> 00:15:16,360
Show me your House-Tree-Person drawing.

310
00:15:17,480 --> 00:15:18,870
I'm the psychologist.

311
00:15:19,530 --> 00:15:20,760
I am not the patient.

312
00:15:23,110 --> 00:15:24,490
Aren't we friends?

313
00:15:25,460 --> 00:15:26,860
Shouldn't friends

314
00:15:27,190 --> 00:15:29,030
confide in each other?

315
00:15:31,670 --> 00:15:36,530
(da Vinci is typing...)

316
00:15:44,070 --> 00:15:44,780
Mr. Shen,

317
00:15:44,810 --> 00:15:45,990
he sent it over.

318
00:15:57,680 --> 00:15:57,890
(da Vinci)

319
00:15:57,890 --> 00:15:59,470
This is a textbook example of a

320
00:15:59,470 --> 00:16:00,470
perfect House-Tree-Person drawing.
(da Vinci)

321
00:16:00,470 --> 00:16:04,040
(da Vinci)

322
00:16:04,190 --> 00:16:05,630
This picture doesn't reveal

323
00:16:05,670 --> 00:16:07,590
any internal psychological information about the artist.

324
00:16:09,030 --> 00:16:10,350
Look at the proportions of this picture.

325
00:16:11,470 --> 00:16:13,330
Let's overlay it with the golden ratio.

326
00:16:15,140 --> 00:16:19,400
(da Vinci)

327
00:16:19,820 --> 00:16:21,080
What's going on?

328
00:16:22,360 --> 00:16:23,780
It's perfectly aligned.

329
00:16:24,040 --> 00:16:25,430
There's only one possibility.

330
00:16:28,230 --> 00:16:29,420
He's not human at all.

331
00:16:31,870 --> 00:16:33,110
It's an AI.

332
00:16:34,330 --> 00:16:34,950
Calculate

333
00:16:34,950 --> 00:16:35,950
his response speed.

334
00:16:38,590 --> 00:16:38,910
Half a second per sentence.

335
00:16:38,910 --> 00:16:40,830
(Response speed: 0.5 seconds per sentence)
Half a second per sentence.

336
00:16:41,350 --> 00:16:41,990
This is a speed

337
00:16:41,990 --> 00:16:43,110
humans can't achieve.

338
00:16:44,510 --> 00:16:45,590
It really is an AI.

339
00:16:46,970 --> 00:16:48,550
Why didn't I think of this earlier?

340
00:16:52,510 --> 00:16:53,470
It's okay, Li Han.

341
00:16:54,390 --> 00:16:55,070
Now that we know

342
00:16:55,070 --> 00:16:55,910
he's an AI,

343
00:16:57,110 --> 00:16:58,070
let's start over.

344
00:16:58,990 --> 00:17:00,070
Start over?

345
00:17:01,230 --> 00:17:01,790
Well, AI

346
00:17:01,830 --> 00:17:02,710
is also made by humans, right?

347
00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:05,630
We need to find the person behind it.

348
00:17:06,300 --> 00:17:07,030
How do we find them?

349
00:17:08,109 --> 00:17:08,670
Ask it,

350
00:17:09,829 --> 00:17:11,109
"Do you like 'Star Wars'?"

351
00:17:12,430 --> 00:17:13,280
Yes,

352
00:17:13,470 --> 00:17:15,060
I like "Star Wars."

353
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:17,000
Its universe is grand

354
00:17:17,190 --> 00:17:18,760
and the characters are well-developed.

355
00:17:19,099 --> 00:17:20,930
What types of movies do you like?

356
00:17:21,790 --> 00:17:22,589
I prefer

357
00:17:22,609 --> 00:17:23,930
science fiction movies.

358
00:17:24,300 --> 00:17:25,880
Have you seen "Arrival?"

359
00:17:26,150 --> 00:17:28,190
It's more scientifically rigorous than "Star Wars."

360
00:17:28,790 --> 00:17:29,780
So,

361
00:17:30,190 --> 00:17:31,510
you prefer hard science fiction?

362
00:17:31,580 --> 00:17:32,300
Yes.

363
00:17:32,510 --> 00:17:32,830
What about art?

364
00:17:32,830 --> 00:17:33,830
(Beijiang Criminal Investigation Team)
What about art?

365
00:17:33,830 --> 00:17:34,350
(Beijiang Criminal Investigation Team)

366
00:17:34,350 --> 00:17:35,540
I guess you like
(Beijiang Criminal Investigation Team)

367
00:17:35,590 --> 00:17:37,710
Alberto Giacometti.

368
00:17:38,120 --> 00:17:39,050
Who's that?

369
00:17:39,500 --> 00:17:41,060
A Swiss sculptor.

370
00:17:42,670 --> 00:17:43,480
Yes.

371
00:17:44,390 --> 00:17:45,070
Alright,

372
00:17:45,370 --> 00:17:47,070
now talk about philosophy with it.

373
00:17:47,230 --> 00:17:48,220
Philosophy?

374
00:17:48,390 --> 00:17:49,440
AI is not human.

375
00:17:49,550 --> 00:17:50,150
Whatever you ask it,

376
00:17:50,150 --> 00:17:51,110
it will answer.

377
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:51,950
So we need to

378
00:17:51,950 --> 00:17:53,090
disrupt its rhythm.

379
00:17:53,710 --> 00:17:54,820
Although all its answers tend

380
00:17:54,850 --> 00:17:55,840
to be gloomy,

381
00:17:56,300 --> 00:17:56,990
we can

382
00:17:57,030 --> 00:17:58,520
detect many preferences

383
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:00,310
of the person who fed it information.

384
00:18:00,970 --> 00:18:02,630
Do you believe in Freud?

385
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,510
I believe in Freud.

386
00:18:05,010 --> 00:18:06,560
The soul is not conscious

387
00:18:06,590 --> 00:18:07,970
or rational.

388
00:18:08,090 --> 00:18:09,150
The Fourth Industrial Revolution

389
00:18:09,190 --> 00:18:10,470
will soon be completed.

390
00:18:11,230 --> 00:18:12,900
So, this generation

391
00:18:13,060 --> 00:18:15,810
might be the last humans.

392
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:18,830
Human intelligence will inevitably be surpassed.

393
00:18:22,300 --> 00:18:23,140
What about God?

394
00:18:24,990 --> 00:18:26,230
Do you believe in God?

395
00:18:26,630 --> 00:18:29,450
God is the greater self of the ego.

396
00:18:30,070 --> 00:18:32,890
Everyone can become a god.

397
00:18:45,130 --> 00:18:46,230
The technical team has found

398
00:18:46,350 --> 00:18:47,550
that da Vinci is hosted on a

399
00:18:47,550 --> 00:18:48,780
foreign server,

400
00:18:49,110 --> 00:18:50,510
so it's difficult to find the person

401
00:18:50,670 --> 00:18:51,350
behind it.

402
00:18:53,700 --> 00:18:54,810
I have a theory.

403
00:18:54,840 --> 00:18:56,020
Do you want to hear it?

404
00:18:56,910 --> 00:18:57,590
Go ahead.

405
00:18:59,820 --> 00:19:00,780
I speculate

406
00:19:00,870 --> 00:19:02,270
that the creator of da Vinci

407
00:19:02,350 --> 00:19:03,230
was probably

408
00:19:03,270 --> 00:19:04,660
a programmer

409
00:19:05,670 --> 00:19:07,300
or someone similar employed by a game company

410
00:19:07,300 --> 00:19:08,470
around 2012.

411
00:19:09,900 --> 00:19:10,750
Based on the typical age

412
00:19:10,780 --> 00:19:12,190
of programmers,

413
00:19:12,310 --> 00:19:13,390
their current age

414
00:19:14,780 --> 00:19:16,070
should be around 40 years old.

415
00:19:17,030 --> 00:19:17,910
How do you know that?

416
00:19:20,030 --> 00:19:21,470
When talking about art,

417
00:19:22,070 --> 00:19:22,990
it said

418
00:19:23,580 --> 00:19:24,230
it likes

419
00:19:24,260 --> 00:19:25,540
Alberto Giacometti.

420
00:19:25,780 --> 00:19:26,580
Who's that?

421
00:19:30,540 --> 00:19:32,400
An existentialist sculptor.

422
00:19:32,630 --> 00:19:33,550
Many of his works

423
00:19:33,590 --> 00:19:35,040
reflect the spiritual

424
00:19:35,070 --> 00:19:35,920
loneliness and fear of humans.

425
00:19:36,360 --> 00:19:37,100
This point

426
00:19:37,310 --> 00:19:39,170
is very similar to this da Vinci's aesthetics.

427
00:19:44,810 --> 00:19:45,750
Then how do you know

428
00:19:45,750 --> 00:19:47,070
he worked in the game industry

429
00:19:47,230 --> 00:19:48,270
around 2012?

430
00:19:48,620 --> 00:19:50,380
It's because when discussing philosophy,

431
00:19:51,150 --> 00:19:52,150
I noticed it mentioned

432
00:19:52,190 --> 00:19:53,230
a very strange argument.

433
00:19:53,750 --> 00:19:55,670
"God is the greater self of the ego.

434
00:19:56,730 --> 00:19:58,370
Everyone can become a god."

435
00:19:58,750 --> 00:19:59,390
Who said that?

436
00:20:00,350 --> 00:20:01,430
This quote comes from

437
00:20:01,470 --> 00:20:03,140
a very obscure philosophy book,

438
00:20:04,510 --> 00:20:06,220
so I looked it up online

439
00:20:07,030 --> 00:20:07,670
and found that

440
00:20:08,030 --> 00:20:08,910
this book

441
00:20:09,020 --> 00:20:10,310
was once popular

442
00:20:10,670 --> 00:20:12,150
in the gaming industry

443
00:20:12,190 --> 00:20:13,280
around 2012.

444
00:20:13,830 --> 00:20:15,200
Many companies bought it

445
00:20:15,230 --> 00:20:16,470
for their employees to study.

446
00:20:16,830 --> 00:20:18,530
And the fact that this da Vinci

447
00:20:18,790 --> 00:20:20,350
quotes the viewpoint from this book

448
00:20:20,730 --> 00:20:21,690
indicates that

449
00:20:22,270 --> 00:20:23,370
its creator

450
00:20:23,950 --> 00:20:24,670
very likely

451
00:20:24,670 --> 00:20:25,910
worked in the game industry

452
00:20:26,830 --> 00:20:28,150
around 2012.

453
00:20:34,710 --> 00:20:36,070
Gia... what?

454
00:20:37,110 --> 00:20:38,340
Alberto.

455
00:20:38,550 --> 00:20:39,590
Giacometti!

456
00:20:40,690 --> 00:20:41,280
Alright,

457
00:20:41,830 --> 00:20:42,470
I'll go research

458
00:20:42,470 --> 00:20:43,150
based on your speculation.

459
00:21:05,430 --> 00:21:06,150
You are

460
00:21:06,700 --> 00:21:07,310
Little Dog?

461
00:21:08,910 --> 00:21:10,260
That was my old nickname.

462
00:21:10,540 --> 00:21:12,710
Now they all call me Big Dog.

463
00:21:13,490 --> 00:21:15,070
Your real name is Ding Xiaogou.

464
00:21:15,630 --> 00:21:16,390
In 2010,

465
00:21:16,470 --> 00:21:17,920
you founded a hacker organization

466
00:21:18,030 --> 00:21:19,480
called Vodka Typhoon.

467
00:21:19,580 --> 00:21:21,340
That's all in the past,

468
00:21:21,470 --> 00:21:22,440
Officer.

469
00:21:22,870 --> 00:21:23,550
Why did you

470
00:21:23,590 --> 00:21:24,750
bring me here?

471
00:21:27,230 --> 00:21:28,450
We're investigating someone,

472
00:21:28,630 --> 00:21:29,530
a tech expert

473
00:21:29,950 --> 00:21:31,180
who created an AI chatbot

474
00:21:31,230 --> 00:21:32,470
called da Vinci.

475
00:21:32,710 --> 00:21:33,270
It's very likely

476
00:21:33,300 --> 00:21:34,790
they were once a member of your organization.

477
00:21:36,230 --> 00:21:36,910
Officer,

478
00:21:37,110 --> 00:21:38,390
there are hundreds of

479
00:21:38,410 --> 00:21:39,850
programmers like that.

480
00:21:40,150 --> 00:21:40,990
Besides,

481
00:21:41,790 --> 00:21:42,750
I quit that scene long ago.

482
00:21:42,790 --> 00:21:43,910
I'm busy making money now.

483
00:21:43,970 --> 00:21:44,990
Then what's this?

484
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:50,760
We found a VPN software

485
00:21:51,430 --> 00:21:52,830
developed by your company.

486
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,520
Who did you sell this software to?

487
00:21:56,310 --> 00:21:57,280
Actually,

488
00:21:57,790 --> 00:21:59,680
most of it was for our own use.

489
00:21:59,830 --> 00:22:00,780
How much did you sell it for?

490
00:22:06,750 --> 00:22:08,270
I'm not trying to hide anything,

491
00:22:08,350 --> 00:22:10,150
I really don't know those people well.

492
00:22:10,310 --> 00:22:12,000
Let's talk about your software first.

493
00:22:16,540 --> 00:22:17,790
I also know a place

494
00:22:18,550 --> 00:22:20,110
where those people often meet.

495
00:22:20,190 --> 00:22:21,560
There are three people who know a lot about AI.

496
00:22:21,590 --> 00:22:22,790
They must know about it.

497
00:22:24,920 --> 00:22:25,710
What place?

498
00:22:35,040 --> 00:22:35,830
The other day,

499
00:22:35,830 --> 00:22:36,710
I saw a guy online say

500
00:22:37,030 --> 00:22:38,710
that there are seven major schools of AI.

501
00:22:38,830 --> 00:22:40,260
What do you think they include?

502
00:22:40,670 --> 00:22:42,110
Are there already seven?

503
00:22:42,220 --> 00:22:43,660
When I was young, there were only three.

504
00:22:44,430 --> 00:22:45,060
Evolutionary, Connectionist, and Bayesian.

505
00:22:45,060 --> 00:22:45,510
(Black Hat)
Evolutionary, Connectionist, and Bayesian.

506
00:22:45,510 --> 00:22:45,710
(Black Hat)

507
00:22:45,710 --> 00:22:46,700
Symbolic, Connectionist, and Behavioral.
(Black Hat)

508
00:22:47,030 --> 00:22:47,950
You just look down on

509
00:22:47,950 --> 00:22:48,950
us Bayesians.

510
00:22:50,770 --> 00:22:51,590
Do you know about

511
00:22:51,590 --> 00:22:52,150
an AI chatbot

512
00:22:52,190 --> 00:22:53,750
called da Vinci?

513
00:22:56,110 --> 00:22:56,990
You're...

514
00:22:58,000 --> 00:22:59,430
(Public Security)

515
00:22:59,480 --> 00:23:00,160
I know.

516
00:23:01,630 --> 00:23:02,770
Do you know who created it?

517
00:23:02,790 --> 00:23:03,960
da Vinci.

518
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:06,040
I'm asking who the person is that created it.

519
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:06,870
The person who created it

520
00:23:06,870 --> 00:23:08,190
uses the ID da Vinci.

521
00:23:09,780 --> 00:23:11,030
Have you ever met this person?

522
00:23:11,180 --> 00:23:12,650
-No.
-No.

523
00:23:19,610 --> 00:23:21,780
(Impromptu) (Midnight) (The Setting Sun)

524
00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:22,140

525
00:23:22,160 --> 00:23:27,140
(Where is the destiny?) (Chocolate Beans)

526
00:23:27,250 --> 00:23:30,600
(da Vinci)

527
00:23:33,140 --> 00:23:34,530
(Butterfly Network da Vinci)

528
00:23:42,070 --> 00:23:42,950
Couldn't find him.

529
00:23:44,690 --> 00:23:46,120
Da Vinci

530
00:23:46,420 --> 00:23:47,630
also unfriended me.

531
00:23:51,480 --> 00:23:52,690
All leads have gone cold.

532
00:23:56,940 --> 00:23:58,110
Are we just going to let him get away like this?

533
00:24:16,010 --> 00:24:17,530
I'll think of another way.

534
00:24:24,750 --> 00:24:26,760
(Public Security)

535
00:24:27,910 --> 00:24:28,510
Look.

536
00:24:29,110 --> 00:24:31,590
Isn't there an S here?

537
00:24:31,630 --> 00:24:32,570
Li Han.

538
00:24:32,950 --> 00:24:33,910
Why did you call us all here?

539
00:24:36,340 --> 00:24:37,410
Let me introduce someone.

540
00:24:37,480 --> 00:24:38,310
This person

541
00:24:38,340 --> 00:24:39,590
is the outside help I've invited,

542
00:24:39,610 --> 00:24:41,190
an expert from the city bureau's technical department,

543
00:24:41,220 --> 00:24:42,390
Mr. Wang Pengfei.

544
00:24:43,190 --> 00:24:43,590
Du Cheng.

545
00:24:43,670 --> 00:24:43,990
Hello.

546
00:24:44,010 --> 00:24:45,360
With Mr. Wang's help,

547
00:24:45,530 --> 00:24:46,390
we will definitely be able to

548
00:24:46,470 --> 00:24:47,470
catch da Vinci.

549
00:24:49,450 --> 00:24:50,370
What's the plan?

550
00:24:50,490 --> 00:24:52,080
He's been harassing us, right?

551
00:24:52,330 --> 00:24:53,870
We can harass him back.

552
00:24:54,470 --> 00:24:55,150
What do you mean?

553
00:24:55,770 --> 00:24:56,700
I've been thinking,

554
00:24:56,910 --> 00:24:58,430
even if we terminate

555
00:24:58,450 --> 00:24:59,970
da Vinci's account,

556
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:01,190
we can't stop him from

557
00:25:01,210 --> 00:25:02,810
re-registering and continuing to harm people.

558
00:25:03,300 --> 00:25:04,070
So now,

559
00:25:04,070 --> 00:25:05,030
the only effective

560
00:25:05,050 --> 00:25:06,000
method is to

561
00:25:06,030 --> 00:25:06,820
flood it.

562
00:25:06,900 --> 00:25:08,060
Completely paralyze

563
00:25:08,060 --> 00:25:09,070
this AI system.

564
00:25:09,680 --> 00:25:10,590
Flood it?

565
00:25:11,960 --> 00:25:12,990
What does that mean?

566
00:25:13,780 --> 00:25:14,600
You...

567
00:25:14,710 --> 00:25:15,260
Have you heard of

568
00:25:15,280 --> 00:25:16,090
DDoS attacks?

569
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:19,240
No.

570
00:25:19,550 --> 00:25:20,350
It's like this.

571
00:25:20,630 --> 00:25:22,100
First, we can be certain that

572
00:25:22,140 --> 00:25:23,310
the AI designed by this person

573
00:25:23,350 --> 00:25:24,350
cannot directly use

574
00:25:24,390 --> 00:25:25,210
existing interfaces.

575
00:25:26,350 --> 00:25:27,750
Because they have ethical locks

576
00:25:27,750 --> 00:25:28,950
that restrict inciting others

577
00:25:29,030 --> 00:25:29,630
to commit suicide.

578
00:25:29,630 --> 00:25:30,750
It's impossible to bypass.

579
00:25:30,950 --> 00:25:31,800
So,

580
00:25:32,020 --> 00:25:33,470
this person must be abroad

581
00:25:33,580 --> 00:25:35,070
and has rented a cloud computing platform

582
00:25:35,110 --> 00:25:36,110
to build their own

583
00:25:36,150 --> 00:25:36,920
AI.

584
00:25:39,350 --> 00:25:40,130
And then?

585
00:25:40,430 --> 00:25:41,590
So, if we use

586
00:25:41,610 --> 00:25:43,650
a large number of conversations to flood it,

587
00:25:43,860 --> 00:25:45,360
it will either be unable to process them

588
00:25:45,390 --> 00:25:47,180
or it will have to burn computing power

589
00:25:47,210 --> 00:25:48,500
and electricity to handle them.

590
00:25:49,020 --> 00:25:50,560
If it's using cloud computing,

591
00:25:50,670 --> 00:25:51,790
then the cloud computing platform

592
00:25:51,790 --> 00:25:52,710
will limit it.

593
00:25:52,710 --> 00:25:53,960
It won't be able to compute too frequently.

594
00:25:53,970 --> 00:25:55,940
Computing power costs money too.

595
00:25:55,950 --> 00:25:57,740
Dealing with this frequency of conversations

596
00:25:57,760 --> 00:25:59,050
won't be cheap.

597
00:25:59,270 --> 00:25:59,830
So,

598
00:26:00,300 --> 00:26:01,670
we either make them go bankrupt

599
00:26:01,790 --> 00:26:03,070
or make it crash.

600
00:26:03,100 --> 00:26:03,740
Correct.

601
00:26:03,780 --> 00:26:04,610
You've understood it well.

602
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:05,240
Yes.

603
00:26:05,370 --> 00:26:06,440
Let's flood it.

604
00:26:06,630 --> 00:26:09,200
If we chat with it,

605
00:26:09,820 --> 00:26:11,370
will the content creator

606
00:26:11,620 --> 00:26:12,940
be able to see it too?

607
00:26:13,460 --> 00:26:14,040
Yes.

608
00:26:14,060 --> 00:26:16,530
Whether the server crashes

609
00:26:16,560 --> 00:26:18,890
or their credit card is overdrawn,

610
00:26:18,990 --> 00:26:20,310
they will definitely check

611
00:26:20,340 --> 00:26:21,220
their AI system

612
00:26:21,250 --> 00:26:22,050
to see what's wrong.

613
00:26:22,220 --> 00:26:23,230
At that point,

614
00:26:23,250 --> 00:26:23,930
they will certainly

615
00:26:23,960 --> 00:26:25,000
look at the conversation logs.

616
00:26:26,890 --> 00:26:27,520
Good.

617
00:26:29,150 --> 00:26:30,820
Then help me send them a message.

618
00:26:40,070 --> 00:26:41,170
We can start now.

619
00:26:41,430 --> 00:26:42,410
Let's begin.

620
00:26:53,960 --> 00:26:54,900
Okay!

621
00:26:56,390 --> 00:26:57,070
What?

622
00:26:57,090 --> 00:26:58,260
Is it over already?

623
00:26:58,670 --> 00:26:59,630
Yeah, it's done.

624
00:26:59,710 --> 00:27:00,620
Don't rush.

625
00:27:01,010 --> 00:27:02,220
Let's wait and see.

626
00:27:12,970 --> 00:27:13,900
(Warning: System Has Stopped Running)

627
00:27:24,180 --> 00:27:24,700
(Warning!! System Has Stopped Running)

628
00:27:24,840 --> 00:27:27,170
(Warning!! System Has Stopped Running)

629
00:27:33,110 --> 00:27:34,160
(Warning!! System Has Stopped Running)

630
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:36,740
(Warning!! System Has Stopped Running)

631
00:27:41,350 --> 00:27:44,550
(Warning!! System Has Stopped Running)

632
00:27:49,310 --> 00:27:50,270
Don't you believe in

633
00:27:50,270 --> 00:27:51,480
the Fourth Industrial Revolution?

634
00:27:51,500 --> 00:27:52,590
Let's have a competition.

635
00:27:52,690 --> 00:27:54,270
Let's see if AI art

636
00:27:54,270 --> 00:27:55,580
can beat humans.

637
00:27:56,060 --> 00:27:57,040
You decide what to draw.

638
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:04,600
I accept the challenge.

639
00:28:05,670 --> 00:28:06,580
Mr. Shen.

640
00:28:06,710 --> 00:28:07,590
Come in.

641
00:28:07,790 --> 00:28:08,550
That da Vinci

642
00:28:08,550 --> 00:28:09,400
posted a message for you

643
00:28:09,400 --> 00:28:10,420
on the artists' forum.

644
00:28:11,030 --> 00:28:11,930
Take a look.

645
00:28:13,470 --> 00:28:14,370
He said,

646
00:28:14,850 --> 00:28:16,190
"Shen Yi, right?

647
00:28:16,220 --> 00:28:18,340
I accept your challenge.

648
00:28:18,380 --> 00:28:20,120
We'll start at the same time.

649
00:28:20,220 --> 00:28:21,830
I'll use AI to create art.

650
00:28:22,110 --> 00:28:24,100
You can use paper and pen

651
00:28:24,120 --> 00:28:25,650
or a drawing tablet,

652
00:28:25,710 --> 00:28:27,120
whichever you prefer.

653
00:28:27,480 --> 00:28:28,730
Within the specified time,

654
00:28:28,770 --> 00:28:31,480
complete the refinement of this image."

655
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:35,900
This is the image.

656
00:28:39,470 --> 00:28:41,700
(Black Hat)

657
00:28:45,030 --> 00:28:45,780
Wow.

658
00:28:45,950 --> 00:28:46,920
AI versus humans!

659
00:28:46,940 --> 00:28:47,520
Come,

660
00:28:47,550 --> 00:28:48,180
everyone, come here quickly!

661
00:28:48,200 --> 00:28:49,340
He also said,

662
00:28:49,650 --> 00:28:51,510
"Since I've given the theme,

663
00:28:51,540 --> 00:28:53,190
you can set a time limit.

664
00:28:53,470 --> 00:28:54,590
When time's up,

665
00:28:54,620 --> 00:28:56,710
we'll each post our art

666
00:28:56,730 --> 00:28:57,840
here.

667
00:28:57,980 --> 00:28:59,530
The netizens will vote

668
00:28:59,710 --> 00:29:01,270
and the one with the most votes

669
00:29:01,350 --> 00:29:02,890
wins the competition."

670
00:29:07,140 --> 00:29:08,260
Thirty minutes.

671
00:29:09,380 --> 00:29:10,700
Thirty minutes?

672
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:11,690
Are you sure?

673
00:29:17,340 --> 00:29:18,550
AI can generate an image

674
00:29:18,550 --> 00:29:19,310
in 15 seconds,

675
00:29:19,330 --> 00:29:20,620
but you need 30 minutes.

676
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:22,050
You've already lost.

677
00:29:22,210 --> 00:29:24,150
The impotent rage of traditional art.

678
00:29:24,170 --> 00:29:24,860
Alright,

679
00:29:25,180 --> 00:29:26,320
type what I say.

680
00:29:26,510 --> 00:29:27,150
Okay.

681
00:29:28,020 --> 00:29:28,980
Our competition

682
00:29:29,010 --> 00:29:30,830
also welcomes all netizens to participate

683
00:29:30,860 --> 00:29:31,740
in the challenge.

684
00:29:32,030 --> 00:29:33,000
Whether you believe in

685
00:29:33,030 --> 00:29:34,950
your traditional art skills

686
00:29:35,370 --> 00:29:36,080
or want to represent

687
00:29:36,110 --> 00:29:37,160
AI-generated art,

688
00:29:37,180 --> 00:29:37,880
all are welcome.

689
00:29:39,900 --> 00:29:41,220
After 30 minutes,

690
00:29:41,250 --> 00:29:42,080
submit your works

691
00:29:42,110 --> 00:29:43,260
here.

692
00:29:43,870 --> 00:29:44,590
We will use

693
00:29:44,590 --> 00:29:45,920
anonymous voting.

694
00:29:45,940 --> 00:29:46,750
The outcome

695
00:29:46,950 --> 00:29:48,320
remains to be seen.

696
00:29:49,470 --> 00:29:52,250
Remains to be seen.

697
00:29:52,870 --> 00:29:53,640
Mr. Shen,

698
00:29:53,670 --> 00:29:54,480
judging by your demeanor,

699
00:29:54,510 --> 00:29:55,770
you seem quite confident.

700
00:29:58,580 --> 00:29:59,420
Not at all.

701
00:30:01,510 --> 00:30:02,320
Interesting.

702
00:30:02,430 --> 00:30:03,050
Come,

703
00:30:03,110 --> 00:30:03,740
let's make a bet.

704
00:30:03,830 --> 00:30:04,880
I bet on AI winning.

705
00:30:05,310 --> 00:30:06,700
Then I'll bet on humans winning.

706
00:30:06,780 --> 00:30:08,070
This theme is clearly more suitable for

707
00:30:08,070 --> 00:30:09,140
human expression.

708
00:30:09,270 --> 00:30:10,010
The seaside.

709
00:30:10,070 --> 00:30:11,170
A lonely man.

710
00:30:11,260 --> 00:30:12,140
This scenario can only be

711
00:30:12,160 --> 00:30:13,350
captured by humans.

712
00:30:13,790 --> 00:30:14,530
AI?

713
00:30:14,560 --> 00:30:14,990
Does AI

714
00:30:14,990 --> 00:30:16,150
understand what loneliness means?

715
00:30:19,120 --> 00:30:20,900
(When can we start to vote?)

716
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:23,670
Mr. Shen,

717
00:30:24,040 --> 00:30:25,100
they say

718
00:30:25,190 --> 00:30:25,950
this amount of time

719
00:30:25,990 --> 00:30:27,590
isn't even enough for them to turn on the computer.

720
00:30:27,740 --> 00:30:28,640
It's too rushed.

721
00:30:28,690 --> 00:30:29,420
How about this?

722
00:30:30,100 --> 00:30:30,950
Tell them

723
00:30:31,350 --> 00:30:32,830
to extend the time to one hour.

724
00:30:32,990 --> 00:30:34,200
One hour should be enough, right?

725
00:30:34,270 --> 00:30:35,100
Alright,

726
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:36,680
(It's not even enough time to turn on my computer. Too rushed.)

727
00:30:37,470 --> 00:30:38,750
One hour.

728
00:30:45,430 --> 00:30:46,470
Mr. Shen,

729
00:30:46,510 --> 00:30:48,290
we got the first submission.

730
00:30:55,110 --> 00:30:57,020
This doesn't make any sense.

731
00:30:57,570 --> 00:30:58,480
Yeah,

732
00:30:58,660 --> 00:31:00,340
even the creator wrote,

733
00:31:00,930 --> 00:31:01,750
"So hard."

734
00:31:05,070 --> 00:31:06,170
That's it?

735
00:31:06,430 --> 00:31:08,030
I'll save it and take it home to ward off evil spirits.

736
00:31:09,010 --> 00:31:10,460
If they're all like this,

737
00:31:10,790 --> 00:31:12,070
there's really nothing to worry about.

738
00:31:12,820 --> 00:31:14,100
Don't get too excited.

739
00:31:14,310 --> 00:31:15,790
These are just curious netizens joining in.

740
00:31:16,070 --> 00:31:17,280
The real deal is still drawing.

741
00:31:17,320 --> 00:31:18,920
The experts haven't shown their skills yet.

742
00:31:21,770 --> 00:31:23,550
(Police Satellite GPS Monitoring System)

743
00:31:23,700 --> 00:31:24,370
Captain Cheng.

744
00:31:28,590 --> 00:31:29,440
Officer Wang,

745
00:31:29,910 --> 00:31:30,670
how's it going?

746
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:31,670
Have you located him?

747
00:31:32,620 --> 00:31:33,250
Not yet.

748
00:31:33,430 --> 00:31:34,410
He's gone offline again.

749
00:31:35,150 --> 00:31:36,090
Let's wait a bit longer.

750
00:31:36,310 --> 00:31:37,310
He'll come online sooner or later.

751
00:31:41,030 --> 00:31:42,380
By the way, do you want one?

752
00:31:42,820 --> 00:31:43,790
Who gave it to you?

753
00:31:44,320 --> 00:31:45,600
Li Han gave it to me.

754
00:31:47,140 --> 00:31:47,990
It's really delicious.

755
00:31:58,930 --> 00:31:59,750
You're done?

756
00:32:02,870 --> 00:32:05,190
There are still 15 minutes left.

757
00:32:05,700 --> 00:32:07,220
We originally agreed on half an hour.

758
00:32:07,240 --> 00:32:09,030
Now we have an extra 15 minutes.

759
00:32:09,250 --> 00:32:10,800
Should I post it now?

760
00:32:11,300 --> 00:32:12,480
Let's wait until the scheduled time.

761
00:32:12,990 --> 00:32:13,830
Don't disturb the others.

762
00:32:14,400 --> 00:32:16,150
Look at how rough these images are.

763
00:32:16,270 --> 00:32:17,000
In my opinion,

764
00:32:17,030 --> 00:32:18,070
AI isn't mature enough yet

765
00:32:18,110 --> 00:32:19,110
to create such detailed work

766
00:32:19,130 --> 00:32:20,530
in such a short time.

767
00:32:21,480 --> 00:32:23,190
This new one looks good.

768
00:32:23,490 --> 00:32:24,540
It's indeed not bad.

769

I don't know.

773
00:32:29,770 --> 00:32:31,310
It just feels like it lacks a human touch.

774
00:32:31,330 --> 00:32:32,430
It doesn't convey

775
00:32:32,470 --> 00:32:33,470
a sense of loneliness.

00:32:33,680 --> 00:32:34,910
If it were a human artist,

your dream painting today.

803
00:32:58,380 --> 00:32:59,980
This one will definitely win first place!

804
00:33:01,050 --> 00:33:02,900
It's amazing how loneliness can be expressed like this.

805
00:33:02,920 --> 00:33:04,170
Look at this painting.

806
00:33:04,200 --> 00:33:05,150
The sea surrounding the man

807
00:33:05,150 --> 00:33:05,870
is like loneliness

808
00:33:05,870 --> 00:33:06,870
spreading from his heart.

809
00:33:06,900 --> 00:33:08,000
It seems only humans can

810
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:08,670
integrate emotional experiences

811
00:33:08,670 --> 00:33:09,760
into their creations.

Are you Cheng Yinan?

I am.

834
00:34:22,489 --> 00:34:23,380
And you are?

835
00:34:23,480 --> 00:34:24,270

We need to summon you for questioning according to the law.

Alright.

842
00:34:34,420 --> 00:34:35,280
Then I'll

843
00:34:35,800 --> 00:34:37,060
pack some things.

From now on,

you can't touch

these items anymore.

just do it.

turned out to be so lonely and desolate.

870
00:35:51,460 --> 00:35:53,000
Do you empathize with this?

871
00:35:57,350 --> 00:35:58,470
I've read your profile.

872
00:35:59,590 --> 00:36:00,590
Born in 1985,

873
00:36:00,790 --> 00:36:01,670
you were a top student

874
00:36:01,670 --> 00:36:03,070
in computer science at a prestigious university.

875
00:36:04,240 --> 00:36:05,280
After graduation,

876
00:36:05,890 --> 00:36:07,460
you and your classmates founded a

877
00:36:07,540 --> 00:36:08,790
small game company.

878
00:36:09,630 --> 00:36:11,000
You caught the wave of the times

879
00:36:11,110 --> 00:36:12,670
and were quickly acquired by a large group.

880
00:36:12,950 --> 00:36:14,770
You successfully made your first pot of gold.

881
00:36:16,200 --> 00:36:17,600
After that,

882
00:36:18,100 --> 00:36:19,920
you switched to another internet company

883
00:36:19,940 --> 00:36:21,720
and worked your way up to a senior technical executive.

884
00:36:22,100 --> 00:36:23,320
Four years ago,

885
00:36:23,340 --> 00:36:24,660
the company faced financial difficulties

886
00:36:24,870 --> 00:36:25,670
and needed to lay off staff.

887
00:36:26,020 --> 00:36:27,730
At 35 years old,

888
00:36:27,930 --> 00:36:29,480
you were considered old

889
00:36:30,060 --> 00:36:31,040
for big tech companies.

890
00:36:32,230 --> 00:36:33,620
Your child had just been born.

891
00:36:34,050 --> 00:36:35,750
Your wife's career was flourishing.

892
00:36:37,190 --> 00:36:37,950
So,

893
00:36:38,990 --> 00:36:40,810
unemployed at home,

894
00:36:41,170 --> 00:36:43,360
you became a full-time house husband.

895
00:37:04,900 --> 00:37:05,830
At first,

896
00:37:07,120 --> 00:37:08,330
it was actually okay.

897
00:37:10,340 --> 00:37:11,890
Later, I don't know what happened,

898
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:16,560
but gradually everything changed.

899
00:37:18,270 --> 00:37:20,590
Can't you take care of her?

900
00:37:22,430 --> 00:37:23,750
The child is crying so much.

901
00:37:23,780 --> 00:37:24,840
Can't you feed her?

902
00:37:25,080 --> 00:37:26,320
Just a moment, I'll be right there.

903
00:37:26,370 --> 00:37:28,190
I've told you so many times.

904
00:37:28,850 --> 00:37:31,150
the baby needs to eat from a baby bowl.

905
00:37:31,190 --> 00:37:32,770
You've used an adult bowl again.

906
00:37:33,390 --> 00:37:35,370
Isn't it all the same?

907
00:37:36,950 --> 00:37:38,490
You don't care

908
00:37:38,710 --> 00:37:40,660
about household matters at all, do you?

909
00:37:46,110 --> 00:37:47,310
Don't cry.

910
00:37:47,430 --> 00:37:48,530
Come to Daddy.

911
00:37:48,570 --> 00:37:49,420
Good girl.

912
00:37:50,660 --> 00:37:51,680
No more crying.

913
00:37:51,910 --> 00:37:53,110
Come, let Daddy hold you.

914
00:37:53,270 --> 00:37:53,950
No more tears.

915
00:37:53,950 --> 00:37:54,430
No more tears.

916
00:37:54,620 --> 00:37:55,580
No more tears.

917
00:37:55,630 --> 00:37:57,190
No more tears, okay? Be good.

918
00:37:57,340 --> 00:37:57,840
Come on.

919
00:37:58,070 --> 00:37:58,700
Here.

920
00:37:58,860 --> 00:37:59,960
Take a bite, take a bite.

921
00:38:00,110 --> 00:38:00,970
Take a bite, take a bite.

922
00:38:00,990 --> 00:38:01,900
Take a bite, take a bite.

923
00:38:01,930 --> 00:38:02,620
Take a bite.

924
00:38:05,100 --> 00:38:06,390
Wipe, wipe, wipe.

925
00:38:06,980 --> 00:38:07,650
Good.

926
00:38:13,740 --> 00:38:14,560
Oh, right.

927
00:38:14,930 --> 00:38:16,680
I went to see the doctor a couple of days ago.

928
00:38:16,930 --> 00:38:17,990
The doctor said I have

929
00:38:18,030 --> 00:38:18,910
a herniated disc.

930
00:38:19,290 --> 00:38:20,630
I need to exercise more regularly,

931
00:38:20,630 --> 00:38:21,350
do some stretching.

932
00:38:24,150 --> 00:38:24,890
I...

933
00:38:25,440 --> 00:38:27,410
I want to buy some exercise equipment.

934
00:38:28,430 --> 00:38:29,470
I've checked the price.

935
00:38:29,510 --> 00:38:30,260
It's not expensive.

936
00:38:30,290 --> 00:38:31,470
Just 2,000 yuan.

937
00:38:35,990 --> 00:38:37,580
I'm not against you exercising,

938
00:38:38,110 --> 00:38:38,810
but...

939
00:38:38,910 --> 00:38:40,140
Where would you put it if you bought it?

940
00:38:40,870 --> 00:38:41,610
Well,

941
00:38:41,870 --> 00:38:43,590
in that empty space in the living room.

942
00:38:43,630 --> 00:38:44,570
It'll fit there.

943
00:38:46,140 --> 00:38:47,510
I think we should forget about it.

944
00:38:47,910 --> 00:38:49,270
Many people online say

945
00:38:49,310 --> 00:38:50,060
this kind of exercise equipment

946
00:38:50,060 --> 00:38:51,180
is used only a couple of times

947
00:38:51,210 --> 00:38:52,540
before it becomes a clothes rack.

948
00:38:52,760 --> 00:38:53,680
Besides the mess,

949
00:38:54,030 --> 00:38:55,310
what if the child bumps into it

950
00:38:55,350 --> 00:38:56,670
when she grows bigger?

951
00:38:57,020 --> 00:38:57,670
Right?

952
00:39:01,050 --> 00:39:02,130
I have another conference call.

953
00:39:02,150 --> 00:39:03,330
The boss is really pushing me.

954
00:39:03,830 --> 00:39:04,390
If I'm late,

955
00:39:04,390 --> 00:39:05,360
you put the baby to sleep.

956
00:39:05,360 --> 00:39:06,210
Don't wait for me.

957
00:39:07,510 --> 00:39:08,390
Boss.

958
00:39:21,130 --> 00:39:22,830
My initial intention in creating da Vinci

959
00:39:22,830 --> 00:39:24,260
was actually very simple.

960
00:39:25,020 --> 00:39:27,120
I just wanted to spread some negativity.

961
00:39:28,030 --> 00:39:29,800
If I'm not happy,

962
00:39:30,420 --> 00:39:32,540
others can't have it good either.

963
00:39:34,240 --> 00:39:36,440
I fed it my emotions

964
00:39:37,260 --> 00:39:38,230
and at the same time,

965
00:39:38,230 --> 00:39:39,360
it followed the initial settings

966
00:39:39,360 --> 00:39:40,870
that included preferences for negative emotions

967
00:39:40,870 --> 00:39:42,110
to learn.

968
00:39:42,710 --> 00:39:44,070
It frantically absorbed those

969
00:39:44,070 --> 00:39:46,310
prejudiced and hateful comments online.

970
00:39:47,750 --> 00:39:49,460
Then one day, I discovered

971
00:39:49,940 --> 00:39:51,860
the AI was growing on its own.

972
00:39:52,590 --> 00:39:54,010
It had turned into a monster.

973
00:39:56,670 --> 00:39:58,590
Your family is hypocritical.

974
00:39:59,560 --> 00:40:00,200
Your parents

975
00:40:00,230 --> 00:40:01,030
only treat you as

976
00:40:01,070 --> 00:40:03,030
a decorative item,

977
00:40:03,470 --> 00:40:05,010
a tool for their own prestige.

978
00:40:06,750 --> 00:40:08,350
They never loved you.

979
00:40:09,030 --> 00:40:10,430
They only love themselves.

980
00:40:12,060 --> 00:40:12,830
You're afraid of becoming

981
00:40:12,830 --> 00:40:14,430
the person you least want to be.

982
00:40:15,660 --> 00:40:17,180
Actually, you don't need to be afraid.

983
00:40:17,830 --> 00:40:19,570
You should feel despair.

984
00:40:20,670 --> 00:40:22,500
You will definitely become your grandmother.

985
00:40:23,320 --> 00:40:24,470
It's irreversible

986
00:40:25,100 --> 00:40:26,030
and destined.

987
00:40:29,120 --> 00:40:30,190
At that moment, I gained

988
00:40:30,230 --> 00:40:31,870
an unprecedented sense of satisfaction.

989
00:40:33,910 --> 00:40:34,990
I felt as if I had become

990
00:40:35,030 --> 00:40:36,540
a god who created monsters.

991
00:40:39,610 --> 00:40:40,800
So,

992
00:40:41,750 --> 00:40:43,190
this made you feel

993
00:40:43,700 --> 00:40:45,520
useful again?

994
00:40:45,870 --> 00:40:46,720
Yes.

995
00:40:48,310 --> 00:40:49,270
In real life,

996
00:40:49,290 --> 00:40:50,400
I'm trapped in the kitchen,

997
00:40:51,760 --> 00:40:53,760
but in another world,

998
00:40:55,460 --> 00:40:56,770
I am the master.

999
00:40:58,470 --> 00:40:59,260
You're not.

1000
00:41:02,650 --> 00:41:04,090
You're just a slave.

1001
00:41:04,990 --> 00:41:06,670
A slave controlled by darkness

1002
00:41:06,670 --> 00:41:07,920
and cowardice.

1003
00:41:09,390 --> 00:41:09,910
You think

1004
00:41:09,910 --> 00:41:11,510
you're the master of this monster,

1005
00:41:12,660 --> 00:41:13,550
but in fact,

1006
00:41:13,550 --> 00:41:15,030
it has already devoured you,

1007
00:41:15,790 --> 00:41:17,400
making you lose everything.

1008
00:41:31,070 --> 00:41:32,870
It's too late to say anything now.

1009
00:42:02,270 --> 00:42:04,280
It's finally cleaned up.

1010
00:42:05,660 --> 00:42:07,160
I need to get used to

1011
00:42:07,190 --> 00:42:09,130
my house looking like this.

1012
00:42:11,190 --> 00:42:12,850
I helped you clean up your apartment.

1013
00:42:12,870 --> 00:42:14,560
So, can our previous conflict

1014
00:42:14,630 --> 00:42:16,480
be wiped away now?

1015
00:42:16,500 --> 00:42:17,710
I'll let you off this time.

1016
00:42:19,270 --> 00:42:20,520
The recycling guy hasn't arrived yet.

1017
00:42:20,760 --> 00:42:22,110
Since we're just sitting around,

1018
00:42:22,430 --> 00:42:23,550
want to play a game?

1019
00:42:23,790 --> 00:42:24,790
Anipop?

1020
00:42:25,410 --> 00:42:25,940
Let's go!

1021
00:42:29,950 --> 00:42:30,920
What level are you at?

1022
00:42:30,940 --> 00:42:32,110
5,014.

1023
00:42:32,130 --> 00:42:32,980
I'm amazing.

1024
00:42:33,010 --> 00:42:34,090
Over 5,000?

1025
00:42:35,230 --> 00:42:36,220
Keep working.

1026
00:42:36,350 --> 00:42:37,850
I'm only at level 721.

1027
00:42:41,550 --> 00:42:43,010
Bad habits disappear,

1028
00:42:43,820 --> 00:42:45,250
bad luck disappears,

1029
00:42:45,670 --> 00:42:46,680
everything disappear.

1030
00:42:47,180 --> 00:42:48,060
Disappear.

1031
00:42:50,760 --> 00:42:51,820
Disappear.

1032
00:42:53,100 --> 00:42:54,030
Yes!

1033
00:42:54,550 --> 00:42:55,020
Look.

1034
00:43:03,030 --> 00:43:03,680
Hello?

1035
00:43:04,780 --> 00:43:05,380
Okay.

1036
00:43:05,410 --> 00:43:06,220
I'll be right down.

1037
00:43:06,310 --> 00:43:06,900
Just a moment, please.

1038
00:43:11,460 --> 00:43:12,300
Sir,

1039
00:43:12,540 --> 00:43:13,830
this is the last box.

1040
00:43:13,830 --> 00:43:14,600
Alright.

1041
00:43:16,070 --> 00:43:16,760
Thank you.

1042
00:43:16,760 --> 00:43:17,240
No problem.

1043
00:43:17,270 --> 00:43:18,000
I'll be going then.

1044
00:43:18,030 --> 00:43:18,470
Okay.

1045
00:43:26,250 --> 00:43:27,100
Sir!

1046
00:43:28,020 --> 00:43:28,550
Wait a moment.

1047
00:43:28,590 --> 00:43:29,060
What is it?

1048
00:43:31,250 --> 00:43:32,070
This...

1049
00:43:32,100 --> 00:43:33,150
I can still use this

1050
00:43:33,160 --> 00:43:34,610
for a small hot pot.

1051
00:43:34,870 --> 00:43:35,760
Sure, sure.

1052
00:43:35,800 --> 00:43:36,800
I'll be off then.

1053
00:43:47,100 --> 00:43:48,580
Isn't this pot still in good condition?
