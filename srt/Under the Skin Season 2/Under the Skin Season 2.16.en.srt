00:01:54,860 --> 00:01:56,100

the people who entered and left.

00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:58,030
However,

11
00:01:58,310 --> 00:01:59,830
last week, Min Shengmei

12
00:01:59,850 --> 00:02:01,110
actually went to see Min Xue.

13
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:06,930
Why did she go to see Min Xue?

14
00:02:07,350 --> 00:02:07,980
I don't know.

15
00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:09,990
The surveillance footage only showed

16
00:02:10,030 --> 00:02:11,510
that she went there with gifts.

17
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:13,000
Min Xue accepted them.

18
00:02:13,210 --> 00:02:15,200
There's no other information besides that.

19
00:02:15,570 --> 00:02:16,700
Have you checked on Min Shengmei's recent situation?

20
00:02:17,100 --> 00:02:17,660
Yes, I have.

21
00:02:17,810 --> 00:02:19,790
She hasn't had a job since getting out of prison,

22
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:20,630
and hasn't remarried.

Let me put them in for you.

No, no need.

00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:19,210
I'll do it myself.

How is it?

00:03:29,079 --> 00:03:29,760
I found it.

48

On the 29th at 8:17 PM,

49
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:39,280
Min Shengmei brought a girl

50
00:03:39,310 --> 00:03:40,720
to check in at the front desk.

51
00:03:40,750 --> 00:03:42,710
In... Room 1018.

52
00:03:43,820 --> 00:03:45,670
But after they went upstairs,

53
00:03:45,670 --> 00:03:46,670
they entered

54
00:03:46,690 --> 00:03:47,970
Room 1016 instead.

55
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:49,400
Shortly after,

56
00:03:49,450 --> 00:03:50,870
Min Shengmei came out alone

57
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:52,740
and walked into Room 1018 next door,

58
00:03:53,220 --> 00:03:54,260
leaving the girl alone

59
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:55,670
in Room 1016.

60
00:03:55,690 --> 00:03:57,790
One hour and 42 minutes later,

61
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:00,690
the girl walked out of 1016

62
00:04:00,790 --> 00:04:02,280
and entered 1018.

63
00:04:02,470 --> 00:04:04,720
Then they both left together.

64
00:04:04,950 --> 00:04:06,620
Do you have the information of the tenant of 1016?

00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:07,270

that on the 29th,

88
00:05:07,530 --> 00:05:08,350
you took a girl

Min Xue.

105
00:05:54,140 --> 00:05:55,050
Do you have any evidence?

What evidence do you need?

107
00:05:58,920 --> 00:06:00,130
Let me tell you,

108
00:06:00,790 --> 00:06:02,780
there are no eternal enemies,

109
00:06:02,810 --> 00:06:04,330
only eternal interests.

110
00:06:05,900 --> 00:06:07,630
Min Xue has never been

111
00:06:07,650 --> 00:06:09,200
a simple person.

112
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:11,700
When I first adopted her,

113
00:06:11,730 --> 00:06:12,670
I felt that

114
00:06:12,950 --> 00:06:14,820
although she had a young face,

115
00:06:14,850 --> 00:06:16,150
the ideas in her head

116
00:06:16,190 --> 00:06:16,670
were definitely not

117
00:06:16,690 --> 00:06:18,450
those of someone her age.

118
00:06:19,770 --> 00:06:20,350
At first,

119
00:06:20,370 --> 00:06:21,530
I doubted her age.

120
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:23,870
But later, because I was

121
00:06:23,910 --> 00:06:24,590
soft-hearted,

122
00:06:25,380 --> 00:06:26,420
I trusted her.

123
00:06:26,970 --> 00:06:28,100
Sure enough, right?

124
00:06:28,470 --> 00:06:29,790
I still feel that

125
00:06:30,030 --> 00:06:31,870
she doesn't look like she's 24 or 25.

126
00:06:31,900 --> 00:06:33,350
So how old

127
00:06:34,230 --> 00:06:35,300
do you think she is?

128
00:06:35,590 --> 00:06:36,909
At least five years older than she claims,

129
00:06:36,990 --> 00:06:37,820
around 30.

130
00:06:39,010 --> 00:06:40,950
So she used her experiences

131
00:06:40,990 --> 00:06:41,990
to create a story

132
00:06:42,150 --> 00:06:44,190
and established that charity home.

133
00:06:44,230 --> 00:06:45,390
She never really

134
00:06:45,420 --> 00:06:47,140
intended to do any good.

135
00:06:47,230 --> 00:06:48,500
She was just

136
00:06:48,550 --> 00:06:50,890
using these girls to make money.

137
00:06:51,070 --> 00:06:52,750
That's why she found me.

138
00:07:00,510 --> 00:07:01,290
Xue.

139
00:07:05,910 --> 00:07:06,760
You're here.

140
00:07:09,950 --> 00:07:11,160
After all these years,

141
00:07:11,470 --> 00:07:13,600
you're the person I've wronged the most.

142
00:07:13,990 --> 00:07:15,930
I really didn't have the face to see you.

143
00:07:16,270 --> 00:07:19,110
I didn't expect you'd still remember me,

144
00:07:19,390 --> 00:07:20,630
let alone allow me to come.

145
00:07:21,090 --> 00:07:23,340
Is this your new residence?

146
00:07:23,700 --> 00:07:24,980
Do you need me to do anything?

147
00:07:25,020 --> 00:07:25,790
Just say the word,

148
00:07:25,830 --> 00:07:26,680
I'll do anything.

149
00:07:27,030 --> 00:07:27,950
Look, I've brought you

150
00:07:27,990 --> 00:07:29,490
so many nice things.

151
00:07:32,100 --> 00:07:33,210

Don't tire yourself out.

Mom.

154
00:07:42,130 --> 00:07:43,890
After getting out,

155
00:07:44,230 --> 00:07:45,370
you've become so useless?

156
00:07:49,909 --> 00:07:51,470
You actually called me...

157
00:07:52,180 --> 00:07:54,100
Does this mean you're willing to forgive me?

158
00:07:55,110 --> 00:07:55,680
I knew

159
00:07:55,710 --> 00:07:57,640
you still had a place for your mother in your heart.

160
00:08:00,030 --> 00:08:01,760
Don't flatter yourself.

161
00:08:03,270 --> 00:08:04,670
You sent me to that pervert

162
00:08:04,690 --> 00:08:05,390
so you could

163
00:08:05,430 --> 00:08:07,450
lead a good life.

164
00:08:08,310 --> 00:08:10,560
How dare you call yourself a mother?

165
00:08:16,390 --> 00:08:17,870
Then why did you call me here?

166
00:08:18,270 --> 00:08:20,010
I don't want to dirty your yard.

167
00:08:20,590 --> 00:08:21,680
Well,

168
00:08:21,950 --> 00:08:22,790
I found you a way

169
00:08:22,830 --> 00:08:24,070
to make money.

170
00:08:27,270 --> 00:08:28,160
You?

171
00:08:31,140 --> 00:08:32,470
So how did you divide the work?

172
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:36,039
That's what makes her so good.

173
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:37,390
She never lets me

174
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:38,230
contact her first.

175
00:08:38,470 --> 00:08:39,710
She always contacts me.

176
00:08:40,090 --> 00:08:41,770
She changes her number after each job.

177
00:08:41,990 --> 00:08:43,250
The girls are hers.

178
00:08:43,350 --> 00:08:44,730
The clients are hers too.

179
00:08:44,830 --> 00:08:46,740
I'm only responsible for taking them there.

180
00:08:46,870 --> 00:08:47,540
If something goes wrong,

181
00:08:47,590 --> 00:08:48,860
she quickly disappears.

182
00:08:49,020 --> 00:08:50,350
Since you're well aware of this,

183
00:08:50,390 --> 00:08:51,470
why do you still work with her?

184
00:08:53,290 --> 00:08:54,360
Greed, of course.

185
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:56,320
I still wanted to get something for nothing.

186
00:08:59,140 --> 00:09:00,040
Min Xue.

187
00:09:00,950 --> 00:09:03,030
The girl you personally saved

188
00:09:03,990 --> 00:09:06,070
has never been a simple person.

189
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:07,650
Surprised?

190
00:09:11,300 --> 00:09:13,200
Although Min Xue is a suspect,

191
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:15,650
there's one thing I can't understand.

192
00:09:16,520 --> 00:09:17,540
She has

193
00:09:17,670 --> 00:09:19,670
suffered the same pain herself,

194
00:09:19,770 --> 00:09:21,430
why would she become an accomplice?

195
00:09:22,310 --> 00:09:24,770
This can be explained in criminal psychology.

196
00:09:27,580 --> 00:09:28,970
It's called victim-perpetrator transformation.

197
00:09:29,430 --> 00:09:30,260
It refers to

198
00:09:30,300 --> 00:09:32,450
a phenomenon where, in rare cases, after being harmed,

199
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:33,880
due to psychological trauma

200
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:35,200
and other influencing factors,

201
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:37,550
a victim

202
00:09:37,930 --> 00:09:39,620
becomes a perpetrator.

203
00:09:39,860 --> 00:09:41,330
In pyramid schemes and telecom fraud,

204
00:09:41,750 --> 00:09:43,030
there were many such examples before.

205
00:09:43,650 --> 00:09:44,970
People who were originally scammed

206
00:09:45,140 --> 00:09:46,940
ended up joining the scammer's team

207
00:09:46,980 --> 00:09:47,910
to scam others.

208
00:09:48,790 --> 00:09:49,680
They could recoup their losses this way.

209
00:09:52,390 --> 00:09:52,950
Captain Cheng.

210
00:09:56,220 --> 00:09:56,820
Captain Cheng.

211
00:09:59,040 --> 00:09:59,830
Why don't we

212
00:10:00,310 --> 00:10:01,690
call Min Xue over

213
00:10:02,460 --> 00:10:03,600
and hear what she has to say?

214
00:10:10,580 --> 00:10:11,310
Alright.

215
00:10:22,950 --> 00:10:24,950
(Inquiry Room)

216
00:10:25,060 --> 00:10:32,360
(Door 01)

217
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:36,800
(Door 01)

218
00:10:48,450 --> 00:10:49,670
This was the first time

219
00:10:49,710 --> 00:10:50,950
I've met her in so many years,

220
00:10:52,110 --> 00:10:53,320
and it was also the only time.

221
00:10:54,980 --> 00:10:56,640
She came uninvited.

222
00:10:58,390 --> 00:10:59,310
Why are you here?

223
00:11:00,270 --> 00:11:00,780
I... I...

224
00:11:00,830 --> 00:11:01,990
I saw you

225
00:11:02,020 --> 00:11:02,920
on TV.

226
00:11:03,190 --> 00:11:04,720
I wanted to come see you.

227
00:11:05,430 --> 00:11:06,880
You've done well for yourself, huh?

228
00:11:08,430 --> 00:11:09,780
All these years,

229
00:11:10,110 --> 00:11:11,270
I've actually felt

230
00:11:11,270 --> 00:11:13,440
quite guilty towards you.

231
00:11:13,950 --> 00:11:15,350
So I came this time

232
00:11:15,390 --> 00:11:16,770
to see

233
00:11:17,390 --> 00:11:19,000
if you could forgive me.

234
00:11:19,750 --> 00:11:20,280
Look,

235
00:11:20,390 --> 00:11:21,030
I've brought you

236
00:11:21,030 --> 00:11:22,280
so many nice things.

237
00:11:26,030 --> 00:11:27,080
Let mommy help you,

238
00:11:27,590 --> 00:11:29,000
don't tire yourself out, my girl.

239
00:11:31,210 --> 00:11:32,410
You're not welcome here.

240
00:11:32,710 --> 00:11:33,830
Take your things and get out.

241
00:11:36,650 --> 00:11:38,510
Seriously, look at you.

242
00:11:38,830 --> 00:11:41,180
After all these years, your temper hasn't changed a bit.

243
00:11:42,180 --> 00:11:43,980
I paid good money for all of those

244
00:11:44,010 --> 00:11:45,590
expensive and high-quality nutritional supplements.

245
00:11:45,710 --> 00:11:48,480
Besides, these children of yours have all suffered.

246
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:50,670
They're growing and need these.

247
00:11:53,670 --> 00:11:56,830
You didn't drug these, did you?

248
00:11:58,070 --> 00:11:59,780
How could I?

249
00:12:00,230 --> 00:12:02,240
I came here with sincerity.

250
00:12:02,460 --> 00:12:03,420
This rescue station of yours

251
00:12:03,470 --> 00:12:04,630
has been advertising

252
00:12:04,670 --> 00:12:05,760
for sponsors, hasn't it?

253
00:12:07,060 --> 00:12:08,080
Why does everything

254
00:12:08,110 --> 00:12:09,110
that comes out of your mouth

255
00:12:09,150 --> 00:12:10,350
sound so unpleasant?

256
00:12:10,590 --> 00:12:12,120
They're called benefactors.

257
00:12:12,140 --> 00:12:14,540
Right, right, right. Benefactors.

258
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:16,280
The reason I came this time

259
00:12:16,750 --> 00:12:17,670
is to introduce

260
00:12:17,690 --> 00:12:19,290
benefactors to your place.

261
00:12:19,620 --> 00:12:20,830
Are you really that kind-hearted?

262
00:12:23,580 --> 00:12:25,660
We've been mother and daughter for so many years.

263
00:12:25,690 --> 00:12:28,300
This is called resource sharing.

264
00:12:28,620 --> 00:12:29,550
Think about it.

265
00:12:29,830 --> 00:12:31,470
I have benefactors,

266
00:12:31,640 --> 00:12:33,070
you have girls.

267
00:12:33,340 --> 00:12:34,300
If you trust me

268
00:12:34,330 --> 00:12:35,730
and hand over the girls to me,

269
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:37,430
we can do business together.

270
00:12:37,460 --> 00:12:38,860
We'll split the profits 50-50.

271
00:12:38,920 --> 00:12:40,700
Could I possibly earn a dime more than you?

272
00:12:40,750 --> 00:12:42,560
Of course not.

273
00:12:43,880 --> 00:12:45,350
The benefactors you're talking about

274
00:12:45,700 --> 00:12:46,590
wouldn't happen to be

275
00:12:46,630 --> 00:12:47,910
people like Zhang Bin, right?

276
00:12:49,370 --> 00:12:50,790
Isn't that exactly what this

277
00:12:50,810 --> 00:12:52,440
charity home of yours does?

278
00:12:52,630 --> 00:12:54,300
We're in the same line of work.

279
00:12:54,330 --> 00:12:55,730
Let's stop beating around the bush.

280
00:12:57,400 --> 00:12:59,150
Who's in the same line of work as you?

281
00:12:59,330 --> 00:13:00,770
We don't do that here.

282
00:13:01,190 --> 00:13:03,020
Looks like you still need further rehabilitation.

283
00:13:04,120 --> 00:13:05,720
Someone has already figured out

284
00:13:05,750 --> 00:13:07,700
the details of your operations here.

285
00:13:09,330 --> 00:13:12,120
I advise you not to provoke people you shouldn't.

286
00:13:12,190 --> 00:13:12,920
Take this.

287
00:13:15,620 --> 00:13:17,130
If you don't believe me, just try it.

288
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,060
Think it over.

289
00:13:22,640 --> 00:13:23,790
Other than that,

290
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:27,040
we never had any other

291
00:13:27,070 --> 00:13:28,270
meeting or contact.

292
00:13:37,210 --> 00:13:38,850
Who are those people Min Shengmei mentioned?

293
00:13:42,210 --> 00:13:43,140
I don't know.

294
00:13:44,670 --> 00:13:45,520
They should be

295
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:48,130
all perverts like Zhang Bin.

296
00:13:52,470 --> 00:13:53,950
What about the things she brought?

297
00:13:55,500 --> 00:13:56,380
Where did they end up?

298
00:13:58,210 --> 00:13:59,610
They were all distributed to everyone.

299
00:14:01,900 --> 00:14:03,940
The rescue station is struggling to operate.

300
00:14:04,130 --> 00:14:05,070
It's not often we get

301
00:14:05,110 --> 00:14:06,150
supplies delivered to our door.

302
00:14:07,010 --> 00:14:08,180
Might as well take them if they're free.

303
00:14:18,380 --> 00:14:20,990
Why would Min Shengmei think

304
00:14:21,010 --> 00:14:22,240
that you and she were in the same line of work?

305
00:14:23,050 --> 00:14:23,990
She even invited you to collaborate

306
00:14:23,990 --> 00:14:24,990
with her on your first meeting.

307
00:14:29,690 --> 00:14:31,330
It's normal that you don't understand.

308
00:14:32,850 --> 00:14:33,630
I only realized

309
00:14:33,630 --> 00:14:35,180
how difficult it is to raise funds

310
00:14:35,390 --> 00:14:37,830
after running this shelter.

311
00:14:39,020 --> 00:14:40,380
Instead, there are

312
00:14:41,110 --> 00:14:42,940
a lot of scumbags

313
00:14:43,830 --> 00:14:45,270
who covet these girls

314
00:14:45,270 --> 00:14:46,430
and want to take advantage of them for free.

315
00:14:49,160 --> 00:14:49,670
I...

316
00:14:51,750 --> 00:14:52,910
When I was young,

317
00:14:53,950 --> 00:14:55,790
I was once abused.

318
00:14:58,360 --> 00:14:59,490
This kind of thing

319
00:15:03,150 --> 00:15:04,230
is too perverse.

320
00:15:05,650 --> 00:15:07,890
So I'd never sell their bodies

321
00:15:07,890 --> 00:15:08,990
for money.

322
00:15:08,990 --> 00:15:10,100
Never.

323
00:15:22,640 --> 00:15:23,320
Du.

324
00:15:25,470 --> 00:15:26,800
Are you suspecting me?

325
00:15:32,350 --> 00:15:33,350
Escort her out of the room first.

326
00:15:54,360 --> 00:15:55,120
It doesn't matter if

327
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:56,110
she's lying or telling the truth.

328
00:15:56,710 --> 00:15:57,770
Money doesn't lie.

329
00:15:59,310 --> 00:16:00,770
Have Li Han investigate

330
00:16:01,010 --> 00:16:03,190
Min Xue and Min Shengmei's online financial transactions.

331
00:16:04,170 --> 00:16:05,320
We'll check offline to see

332
00:16:05,470 --> 00:16:07,420
if they have hidden funds from unknown sources.

333
00:16:41,940 --> 00:16:42,850
Nothing on the first floor.

334
00:16:44,390 --> 00:16:46,020
(Wall of Honor)

335
00:16:46,020 --> 00:16:46,890
Nothing on the third floor.
(Wall of Honor)

336
00:16:46,890 --> 00:16:49,920
(Wall of Honor)

337
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:50,860
Nothing in the rooms either.
(Wall of Honor)

338
00:16:50,860 --> 00:16:51,780
(Wall of Honor)

339
00:16:53,590 --> 00:16:54,710
Captain Lei

340
00:16:56,570 --> 00:16:57,970
would have believed me.

341
00:17:22,420 --> 00:17:25,569
I've already said I didn't hide any money.

342
00:17:33,010 --> 00:17:33,630
Nothing.

343
00:18:28,710 --> 00:18:29,380
Jiang Feng.

344
00:18:44,470 --> 00:18:45,190
Is this yours?

345
00:18:50,140 --> 00:18:51,310
No.

346
00:18:51,830 --> 00:18:52,480
Where did it come from?

347
00:18:52,900 --> 00:18:54,140
I don't know.

348
00:18:58,690 --> 00:19:00,080
Someone is framing me.

349
00:19:03,900 --> 00:19:04,720
Who's framing you?

350
00:19:05,740 --> 00:19:07,030
Min Xue.

351
00:19:13,390 --> 00:19:14,290
Why would she frame you?

352
00:19:14,740 --> 00:19:15,670
She was the one who

353
00:19:15,670 --> 00:19:16,750
lied about her age to deceive me back then.

354
00:19:16,770 --> 00:19:18,410
This must be her doing.

355
00:19:27,610 --> 00:19:30,070
(Beijiang City Public Security Bureau, Beijiang Branch)

356
00:19:30,070 --> 00:19:30,910
Captain Cheng.
(Beijiang City Public Security Bureau, Beijiang Branch)

357
00:19:33,820 --> 00:19:35,660
Mr. Shen is treating everyone to drinks.

358
00:19:37,310 --> 00:19:38,450
Why is he treating us for no reason?

359
00:19:38,660 --> 00:19:39,680
I don't know either.

360
00:19:39,970 --> 00:19:40,930
Everyone has one.

361
00:19:41,570 --> 00:19:42,300
Captain Cheng,

362
00:19:44,300 --> 00:19:45,440
I've checked all

363
00:19:45,470 --> 00:19:46,230
the registered beneficiaries

364
00:19:46,260 --> 00:19:47,580
at Min Xue's rescue station.

365
00:19:48,390 --> 00:19:49,270
They all denied

366
00:19:49,270 --> 00:19:50,430
that Min Xue took them out

367
00:19:50,460 --> 00:19:51,530
or forced them into prostitution.

368
00:19:53,350 --> 00:19:54,340
Moreover,

369
00:19:54,370 --> 00:19:56,430
Wei Xianzhong was already

370
00:19:56,450 --> 00:19:58,840
listed as a donor two years ago.

371
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,520
The donation amount gradually decreased until the incident,

372
00:20:01,550 --> 00:20:03,770
which is consistent with his bankrupt financial situation.

373
00:20:05,270 --> 00:20:06,830
Every expense of the rescue station

374
00:20:06,860 --> 00:20:08,180
is also clearly recorded

375
00:20:08,470 --> 00:20:10,540
and indeed used for daily operational expenses.

376
00:20:11,070 --> 00:20:11,820
They live

377
00:20:11,820 --> 00:20:12,550
a pretty frugal life.

378
00:20:14,230 --> 00:20:15,740
Then all the doubts have been cleared up.

Should we continue investigating?

389
00:20:38,290 --> 00:20:39,020
Investigate.

390
00:20:40,670 --> 00:20:41,910
Whether it's organizing prostitution

391
00:20:42,390 --> 00:20:43,910
or the leak about age falsification,

392
00:20:44,460 --> 00:20:45,500
as long as there are doubts,

393
00:20:45,750 --> 00:20:47,050
we must investigate thoroughly.

394

There's a rumor online

422
00:22:37,480 --> 00:22:39,180
that when Min Xue was assaulted,

423
00:22:40,610 --> 00:22:42,250
she was actually twenty-two years old.

424
00:23:08,780 --> 00:23:10,240
Min Xue's age

425
00:23:11,210 --> 00:23:13,020
was crucial in convicting Zhang Bin.

426
00:23:14,190 --> 00:23:15,760
Because she was underage,

427
00:23:16,710 --> 00:23:18,150
Zhang Bin was convicted of

428
00:23:18,150 --> 00:23:19,770
raping a minor.

429
00:23:20,940 --> 00:23:23,930
If Min Shengmei were telling the truth,

430
00:23:24,940 --> 00:23:26,210
the criteria for sentencing

431
00:23:26,670 --> 00:23:27,430
would be different.

432
00:23:31,190 --> 00:23:33,070
If Min Shengmei were telling the truth,

433
00:23:35,430 --> 00:23:36,390
it would mean that...

434
00:23:37,770 --> 00:23:39,010
Captain Lei made a mistake.

435
00:23:49,330 --> 00:23:50,860
But why would Min Xue lie?

436
00:24:01,470 --> 00:24:02,160
Du Cheng,

437
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:05,230
I understand how you feel.

438
00:24:06,220 --> 00:24:07,470
I also know that Captain Lei

439
00:24:08,550 --> 00:24:09,650
means a lot to you.

440
00:24:13,540 --> 00:24:14,510
But we can't let

441
00:24:14,550 --> 00:24:15,510
personal feelings

442
00:24:16,500 --> 00:24:17,760
prevent us from facing the truth.

443
00:24:25,350 --> 00:24:26,180
Don't worry.

444
00:24:32,160 --> 00:24:32,950
But I don't believe

445
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:34,350
Captain Lei would make such a big mistake.

Can you try to recall again

449
00:24:51,640 --> 00:24:52,780
Min Shengmei's interrogation details

450
00:24:52,780 --> 00:24:53,630
before she recanted?

451
00:24:55,500 --> 00:24:56,680
Let me think.

452
00:25:00,990 --> 00:25:02,720
During the preliminary hearing,

453
00:25:03,160 --> 00:25:05,280
both of them insisted

454
00:25:05,680 --> 00:25:07,590
that Min Xue showed

455
00:25:07,630 --> 00:25:09,030
maturity beyond her age at home.

456
00:25:09,720 --> 00:25:10,660
They both said

457
00:25:10,890 --> 00:25:13,200
Min Xue was deliberately seducing Zhang Bin.

458
00:25:13,680 --> 00:25:14,430
Neither of them believed

459
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:15,430
she was a minor.

460
00:25:16,100 --> 00:25:16,680
When I saw

461
00:25:16,710 --> 00:25:18,030
the way they were testifying,

462
00:25:18,050 --> 00:25:19,510
it seemed like they were putting on an act.

463
00:25:19,660 --> 00:25:20,550
So I didn't believe

464
00:25:20,550 --> 00:25:21,270
it was true either.

465
00:25:21,740 --> 00:25:23,510
But to be cautious, Captain Lei

466
00:25:23,530 --> 00:25:24,380
decided to investigate.

467
00:25:24,600 --> 00:25:25,670
However, after a thorough investigation,

468
00:25:25,710 --> 00:25:26,670
no issues were found.

469
00:25:27,130 --> 00:25:29,460
Later, we visited Min Xue's place of origin

470
00:25:29,710 --> 00:25:31,700
and double-checked her household registration information.

471
00:25:32,030 --> 00:25:34,780
Everything proved that Min Xue was indeed a minor.

472
00:25:35,730 --> 00:25:37,220
So in the end, it was determined to be

473
00:25:37,260 --> 00:25:38,980
the rape of a minor female.

474
00:25:40,970 --> 00:25:42,480
You already know all this, don't you?

475
00:25:44,430 --> 00:25:45,230
Yes.

476
00:25:49,510 --> 00:25:52,520
This case was closed by Captain Lei back then.

477
00:25:58,650 --> 00:26:00,300
I don't believe Captain Lei would have handled the case wrongly.

Back then, Captain Lei

489
00:26:22,290 --> 00:26:23,840
did mention to me

490
00:26:24,100 --> 00:26:25,600
that in investigating

491
00:26:25,630 --> 00:26:26,470
Min Xue's age,

492
00:26:26,490 --> 00:26:27,570
there were some doubts.

visits and investigations,

495
00:26:30,530 --> 00:26:32,630
her household registration information was confirmed to be accurate.

496

the skull structures

544
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:21,800
corresponding to Min Xue at these two ages,

545

as well as the facial feature proportions.

546

A person's skull and facial proportions

547
00:28:30,630 --> 00:28:32,010
generally stabilize

548
00:28:32,040 --> 00:28:33,350
by the age of eighteen

549
00:28:33,450 --> 00:28:35,070
and change very little thereafter.

550
00:28:35,580 --> 00:28:37,580
However, when I compared

551
00:28:37,610 --> 00:28:39,230
Min Xue's developmental stages at these two ages,

552
00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:41,080
I discovered that

553
00:28:43,660 --> 00:28:45,180
they completely overlapped.

554
00:28:45,800 --> 00:28:47,620
This strongly suggests

555
00:28:48,050 --> 00:28:48,950
that Min Xue

556
00:28:48,950 --> 00:28:50,150
was already an adult

557
00:28:50,500 --> 00:28:51,410
at the time of the sexual assault.

558
00:28:52,060 --> 00:28:53,400
If she had been a minor,

559
00:28:53,560 --> 00:28:54,440
her skull

560
00:28:54,470 --> 00:28:55,550
and facial proportions

561
00:28:55,580 --> 00:28:56,980
would have shown significant developmental changes.

562
00:28:57,350 --> 00:28:58,750
It wouldn't be possible

563
00:28:58,780 --> 00:28:59,860
for them to overlap completely like this.

564
00:29:01,280 --> 00:29:02,810
No wonder people online are saying

565
00:29:02,840 --> 00:29:04,520
that Min Xue was

566
00:29:04,550 --> 00:29:05,980
already 22 years old when she was assaulted.

567
00:29:06,670 --> 00:29:07,550
If she were

568
00:29:07,550 --> 00:29:08,870
22 years old back then,

569
00:29:08,890 --> 00:29:10,430
she should be 30 now.

570
00:29:11,290 --> 00:29:13,030
Her appearance

571
00:29:13,370 --> 00:29:14,520
doesn't look like that age.

572
00:29:15,060 --> 00:29:16,590
If Min Xue were already an adult

573
00:29:16,620 --> 00:29:17,670
at the time of the sexual assault,

574
00:29:18,400 --> 00:29:19,690
then her current age

575
00:29:19,910 --> 00:29:21,620
should be over 28.

576
00:29:21,830 --> 00:29:22,770
This one

577
00:29:23,150 --> 00:29:24,230
is what Min Xue should

578
00:29:24,230 --> 00:29:25,350
actually look like now.

579
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:29,080
Therefore, I deduce

580
00:29:29,100 --> 00:29:30,290
that the current Min Xue

581
00:29:30,430 --> 00:29:32,390
has likely undergone cosmetic procedures

582
00:29:32,510 --> 00:29:34,380
to maintain her publicly claimed age

583
00:29:34,850 --> 00:29:36,740
of around 25 years old.

584
00:29:37,430 --> 00:29:38,350
Report complete.

585
00:29:48,550 --> 00:29:50,590
Based on the current online

586
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:52,330
public opinion questioning Min Xue's age,

587
00:29:53,110 --> 00:29:54,870
combined with Shen Yi's analysis just now,

588
00:29:56,380 --> 00:29:57,350
we can conclude that

589
00:29:57,750 --> 00:29:59,710
the investigation process of Zhang Bin's sexual assault case

590
00:29:59,730 --> 00:30:00,990
is indeed questionable.

591
00:30:02,250 --> 00:30:03,590
At the same time, we cannot rule out

592
00:30:03,910 --> 00:30:04,910
the possibility that Comrade Lei Yifei

593
00:30:04,980 --> 00:30:06,070
may have engaged in

594
00:30:06,150 --> 00:30:06,920
dereliction of duty

595
00:30:06,940 --> 00:30:08,270
during the handling of the case.

596
00:30:08,310 --> 00:30:08,910
And then?

597
00:30:15,180 --> 00:30:16,270
If the investigation ultimately reveals

598
00:30:16,310 --> 00:30:17,550
that Captain Lei did mishandle the case back then,

599
00:30:18,590 --> 00:30:19,640
what do you plan to do?

600
00:30:24,140 --> 00:30:25,420
Before I came here,

601
00:30:25,790 --> 00:30:27,090
the city bureau specifically instructed me

602
00:30:27,430 --> 00:30:29,700
to strictly review the case handling procedures.

603
00:30:30,650 --> 00:30:32,200
Once it's determined to be a wrongful conviction,

604
00:30:32,830 --> 00:30:34,290
even if it's been a long time,

605
00:30:34,740 --> 00:30:36,080
we must inform the entire bureau,

606
00:30:36,110 --> 00:30:37,630
revoke Comrade Lei Yifei's

607
00:30:37,650 --> 00:30:38,770
commendation and merit received,

608
00:30:39,120 --> 00:30:41,440
and strictly investigate

609
00:30:41,480 --> 00:30:42,480
the responsibilities at all levels.

610
00:30:43,070 --> 00:30:43,870
This is to give the public

611
00:30:43,910 --> 00:30:45,030
a satisfactory answer.

612
00:30:46,690 --> 00:30:47,720
Do you have any other questions?

613
00:30:52,310 --> 00:30:53,270
Although I wasn't

614
00:30:53,310 --> 00:30:54,390
directly involved in this case back then,

615
00:30:55,340 --> 00:30:56,110
I believe

616
00:30:56,150 --> 00:30:57,310
Captain Lei couldn't have handled the case wrongly.

617
00:30:58,690 --> 00:30:59,950
So do you have a problem

618
00:31:00,420 --> 00:31:02,240
with the case review now?

619
00:31:03,150 --> 00:31:04,190
Can you cooperate?

620
00:31:12,230 --> 00:31:12,950
No problem.

621
00:31:17,410 --> 00:31:18,190
I'll cooperate.

622
00:31:20,100 --> 00:31:20,860
Alright then.

623
00:31:22,290 --> 00:31:23,210
However,

624
00:31:23,240 --> 00:31:24,720
at the time of the investigation,

625
00:31:25,230 --> 00:31:26,560
most of the people present here

626
00:31:27,030 --> 00:31:27,910
were colleagues with

627
00:31:27,950 --> 00:31:28,830
Comrade Lei Yifei.

628
00:31:29,090 --> 00:31:29,970
We need to avoid any conflict of interest.

629
00:31:30,150 --> 00:31:31,390
So for this investigation,

630
00:31:31,390 --> 00:31:32,310
Shen Yi will assist me.

631
00:31:34,350 --> 00:31:35,860
I've already spoken to

632
00:31:35,910 --> 00:31:36,950
Director Zhang about this.

633
00:31:37,320 --> 00:31:38,720
She agrees with my approach.

634
00:31:44,180 --> 00:31:45,070
Du Cheng is most familiar with

635
00:31:45,080 --> 00:31:46,240
Captain Lei's work habits.

636
00:31:48,330 --> 00:31:49,310
I hope he can help

637
00:31:49,330 --> 00:31:50,530
organize some key information.

638
00:31:58,650 --> 00:32:00,370
Captain Lei values evidence the most when handling cases.

639
00:32:02,730 --> 00:32:03,990
He would record all the information

640
00:32:04,010 --> 00:32:05,010
of every case

641
00:32:05,040 --> 00:32:05,920
in his work notes.

642
00:32:08,320 --> 00:32:09,790
Where are those work notes now?

643
00:32:12,360 --> 00:32:13,500
They should be at his home.

644
00:32:22,110 --> 00:32:22,830
Feng.

645
00:32:24,610 --> 00:32:26,280
Put it in the refrigerated high-speed centrifuge.

646
00:32:26,510 --> 00:32:27,070
Okay.

647
00:32:29,070 --> 00:32:29,850
Come in.

648
00:32:31,050 --> 00:32:31,760
Dr. He.

649
00:32:32,190 --> 00:32:32,880
Sorry to bother you.

650
00:32:33,290 --> 00:32:34,680
Captain Lu, Shen Yi.

651
00:32:34,740 --> 00:32:35,680
What can I do for you?

652
00:32:35,790 --> 00:32:36,780
It's about Min Xue's case.

653
00:32:36,780 --> 00:32:38,110
We'd like to get some information from you.

654
00:32:38,890 --> 00:32:39,830
I've reviewed the case files.

655
00:32:39,980 --> 00:32:40,950
You performed a bone age assessment

656
00:32:40,950 --> 00:32:41,720
for her at the time.

657
00:32:41,940 --> 00:32:42,870
Could you help me recall

658
00:32:42,870 --> 00:32:43,750
the circumstances back then?

659
00:32:45,760 --> 00:32:46,910
When I was examining her

660
00:32:46,910 --> 00:32:48,350
during the examination,

661
00:32:49,180 --> 00:32:50,830
I discovered that her development

662
00:32:50,830 --> 00:32:51,670
was significantly advanced.

663
00:32:53,010 --> 00:32:54,520
I had just started working at that time

664
00:32:54,540 --> 00:32:56,230
and I was afraid of being scolded for my carelessness.

665
00:32:56,650 --> 00:32:57,870
Therefore,

666
00:32:58,510 --> 00:33:00,460
I specifically went back to school

667
00:33:01,050 --> 00:33:02,350
to consult my teacher.

668
00:33:03,120 --> 00:33:03,930
Teacher,

669
00:33:03,970 --> 00:33:05,070
I have a question

670
00:33:05,100 --> 00:33:06,300
that I'd like to ask you about.

671
00:33:07,060 --> 00:33:07,730
Go ahead.

672
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:10,390
Could you take a look at this?

673
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:14,490
I just performed

674
00:33:14,530 --> 00:33:15,660
a bone age assessment on this child.

675
00:33:16,130 --> 00:33:17,230
The results show

676
00:33:17,230 --> 00:33:19,130
that her bone age is much older

677
00:33:19,160 --> 00:33:19,950
than the age in her records.

678
00:33:20,340 --> 00:33:21,550
Do you think I can

679
00:33:21,550 --> 00:33:23,350
write a definitive conclusion in the report?

680
00:33:24,700 --> 00:33:26,460
Based on her height data,

681
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:28,420
this child is considered short.

682
00:33:28,510 --> 00:33:30,260
For individuals with precocious development,

683
00:33:30,290 --> 00:33:31,370
there's indeed a possibility

684
00:33:31,390 --> 00:33:32,870
of premature epiphyseal closure.

685
00:33:33,110 --> 00:33:34,390
So the phenomenon you mentioned

686
00:33:34,410 --> 00:33:35,450
is possible.

687
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:39,830
Later, my mentor also said that

688
00:33:39,860 --> 00:33:41,650
a single bone age assessment

689
00:33:41,670 --> 00:33:42,870
cannot be used as the sole basis for judgment.

690
00:33:43,070 --> 00:33:46,370
You need additional cross-referencing evidence to corroborate.

691
00:33:46,400 --> 00:33:48,910
Usually, when welfare institutions adopt children of this age,

692
00:33:48,950 --> 00:33:50,230
they are quite cautious.

693
00:33:50,530 --> 00:33:52,630
They must verify with the police station,

694
00:33:52,660 --> 00:33:54,350
and the police station will investigate the child's background

695
00:33:54,350 --> 00:33:55,370
in advance.

696
00:33:55,670 --> 00:33:56,770
They're unlikely to make mistakes.

697
00:33:56,800 --> 00:33:58,000
So I didn't insist any further.

698
00:33:58,680 --> 00:33:59,430
I understand.

699
00:34:07,650 --> 00:34:08,670
Du Cheng,

700
00:34:08,710 --> 00:34:09,590
why are you here?

701
00:34:11,070 --> 00:34:11,920
Du Cheng.

702
00:34:12,250 --> 00:34:13,070
Sister-in-law.

703
00:34:15,350 --> 00:34:16,179
And this is...?

704
00:34:16,940 --> 00:34:17,830
This is a colleague from the city bureau,

705
00:34:17,830 --> 00:34:18,550
Comrade Lu Haizhou.

706
00:34:18,889 --> 00:34:19,580
Hello, Sister-in-law.

707
00:34:19,770 --> 00:34:20,389
Hello.

708
00:34:20,530 --> 00:34:21,420
There's something...

709
00:34:21,780 --> 00:34:23,080
Regarding Captain Lei.

710
00:34:23,679 --> 00:34:24,080
I...

711
00:34:29,310 --> 00:34:30,400
It's alright, come in and talk.

712
00:34:30,670 --> 00:34:31,900
Come in, come in.

713
00:34:32,560 --> 00:34:33,980
Please don't mind the mess.

714
00:34:34,080 --> 00:34:34,699
Please, have a seat.

715
00:34:35,080 --> 00:34:35,690
Sorry for the intrusion.

716
00:34:40,400 --> 00:34:41,580
My child, Ting,

717
00:34:41,580 --> 00:34:43,030
has always had issues with her father.

718
00:34:43,360 --> 00:34:44,350
Anything related

719
00:34:44,400 --> 00:34:45,350
to her father,

720
00:34:45,469 --> 00:34:46,570
no matter how big or small,

721
00:34:47,080 --> 00:34:48,260
is irrelevant to her.

722
00:34:49,810 --> 00:34:51,590
When Lei was still alive,

723
00:34:53,540 --> 00:34:54,940
he was extremely busy with work.

724
00:34:56,020 --> 00:34:58,260
He couldn't take care of the family or the child.

725
00:34:58,630 --> 00:35:00,590
Ting wouldn't even call him dad.

726
00:35:01,170 --> 00:35:03,260
For years, she's been calling him by his name.

727
00:35:06,640 --> 00:35:07,560
So, what brings

728
00:35:08,530 --> 00:35:09,940
you here?

729
00:35:16,480 --> 00:35:17,130
Sister-in-law,

730
00:35:17,380 --> 00:35:18,310
we're visiting today

731
00:35:18,350 --> 00:35:18,990
about Captain Lei

732
00:35:19,030 --> 00:35:20,230
and an old case he investigated before.

733
00:35:20,470 --> 00:35:21,480
Did he ever mention to you

734
00:35:21,510 --> 00:35:22,390
the case of Min Xue?

735
00:35:24,060 --> 00:35:25,550
Lei was a disciplined man.

736
00:35:26,410 --> 00:35:27,390
He never discussed

737
00:35:27,430 --> 00:35:28,230
case details with us.

738
00:35:28,690 --> 00:35:29,550
All those years,

739
00:35:29,590 --> 00:35:30,430
we've only ever learned

740
00:35:30,450 --> 00:35:31,650
about the cases he handled

741
00:35:31,680 --> 00:35:33,000
from TV and newspapers.

742
00:35:36,520 --> 00:35:37,170
What's the matter?

743
00:35:38,670 --> 00:35:39,260
Nothing.

744
00:35:39,580 --> 00:35:40,900
It's just that this old case

745
00:35:40,990 --> 00:35:42,140
now has some questionable points.

746
00:35:42,170 --> 00:35:43,270
Also, it's related to

747
00:35:43,270 --> 00:35:44,270
-a current case.
-Here’s the thing.

748
00:35:46,010 --> 00:35:47,070
We're currently working on

749
00:35:47,070 --> 00:35:47,790
a case

750
00:35:48,580 --> 00:35:49,780
and we've run into some difficulties.

751
00:35:50,610 --> 00:35:51,750
I remembered

752
00:35:51,870 --> 00:35:52,840
that it's very similar to a case

753
00:35:52,870 --> 00:35:54,540
Captain Lei handled back then.

754
00:35:54,630 --> 00:35:56,730
So we were wondering

755
00:35:56,920 --> 00:35:57,710
if we could borrow

756
00:35:57,710 --> 00:35:58,740
his work notes from that time

757
00:35:59,130 --> 00:35:59,810
to take a look

758
00:36:00,010 --> 00:36:01,060
and get some inspiration.

759
00:36:03,240 --> 00:36:05,140
Work notes?

760
00:36:06,460 --> 00:36:07,550
As far as I remember,

761
00:36:07,590 --> 00:36:08,590
he never left

762
00:36:08,590 --> 00:36:09,750
any work notes.

763
00:36:10,520 --> 00:36:11,410
No, there aren't any.

764
00:36:13,560 --> 00:36:15,150
I wonder if it would be alright

765
00:36:15,190 --> 00:36:16,230
for me to look through Captain Lei's belongings...

766
00:36:16,250 --> 00:36:17,010
If there aren't any, that's fine.

767
00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:21,160
(China Police)

768
00:36:21,160 --> 00:36:22,610
These are my dad's work notes.

770
00:36:27,750 --> 00:36:29,030
This child is still

771
00:36:29,030 --> 00:36:30,030
so inconsiderate even now.

772
00:36:32,480 --> 00:36:33,820
After Lei passed away,

773
00:36:35,180 --> 00:36:36,500
she felt that her father

774
00:36:36,530 --> 00:36:37,970
had completely abandoned us.

776
00:36:55,890 --> 00:36:57,180
I'm so sorry, Sister-in-law.

777
00:36:57,360 --> 00:36:58,850
It's for work. Please understand.

778
00:37:00,360 --> 00:37:01,270
We'll take our leave now.

779
00:37:15,090 --> 00:37:16,270
Captain Lei is the person

780
00:37:16,270 --> 00:37:17,110
I admire most in my life.

781
00:37:20,350 --> 00:37:21,310
Your father

782
00:37:22,540 --> 00:37:24,420
was a respectable and good police officer.

(Group)

787
00:38:04,460 --> 00:38:06,550
It seems Captain Lei

788
00:38:06,590 --> 00:38:07,310
covered several

789
00:38:07,310 --> 00:38:08,430
different routes across the province back then.

all the places

811
00:38:35,310 --> 00:38:36,450
Captain Lei specifically mentioned.

812
00:38:37,570 --> 00:38:39,210
For the things he investigated back then,

813
00:38:39,540 --> 00:38:41,280
we need to rule out any discrepancies

814
00:38:41,300 --> 00:38:42,430
that might have been caused

815
00:38:42,470 --> 00:38:44,030
by outdated technology or systems.

816
00:38:44,700 --> 00:38:45,580
Perhaps we'll make

817
00:38:45,580 --> 00:38:46,270
some unexpected discoveries.

822
00:39:07,730 --> 00:39:09,230
if Captain Lei described

823
00:39:09,400 --> 00:39:11,040
any handicrafts that Lin Xue could do?

824
00:39:43,970 --> 00:39:44,630
No.

825
00:39:49,570 --> 00:39:50,470
I want to go to the welfare home

826
00:39:50,510 --> 00:39:51,510
to find her former teacher

827
00:39:52,060 --> 00:39:53,250
and learn more about this situation.

828
00:39:53,800 --> 00:39:55,710

How did Lin Xue

831
00:40:46,310 --> 00:40:47,190
end up here back then?

832
00:40:47,970 --> 00:40:49,390
She said she was an orphan.

833
00:40:50,380 --> 00:40:51,880

to take her in anymore.
(Caring for minors is caring for our future)

847
00:41:02,730 --> 00:41:03,870
She had nowhere to go,

848
00:41:03,870 --> 00:41:04,950
so she wandered here.

849
00:41:05,800 --> 00:41:07,280
We saw her all dirty and disheveled,

850
00:41:07,280 --> 00:41:08,030
looking pitiful.

851
00:41:08,340 --> 00:41:09,920
We contacted her place of household registration

852
00:41:09,940 --> 00:41:11,300
to verify her situation.

853
00:41:11,390 --> 00:41:12,720
It was indeed true.

854
00:41:12,940 --> 00:41:14,110
So we took her in.

855
00:41:16,870 --> 00:41:18,350
What was her personality like?

856
00:41:18,430 --> 00:41:19,500
Do you remember?

857
00:41:20,430 --> 00:41:22,370
This child was very likable.

858
00:41:22,400 --> 00:41:23,480
She spoke very sweetly.

859
00:41:23,590 --> 00:41:25,470
She especially liked to play with the younger girls.

860
00:41:26,110 --> 00:41:27,290
I always felt that

861
00:41:27,470 --> 00:41:28,500
she was more mature

862
00:41:28,550 --> 00:41:29,950
and sensible than other children.

863
00:41:33,080 --> 00:41:33,400

Was this a handicraft class?

869
00:41:54,670 --> 00:41:55,380
Yes.

870
00:41:55,400 --> 00:41:56,590
In the nearby towns,

871
00:41:56,620 --> 00:41:57,630
there are many individual craftsmen

872
00:41:57,630 --> 00:41:59,030
who make these rope crafts.

873
00:41:59,450 --> 00:42:01,030
It's one of the recreational activities

874
00:42:01,030 --> 00:42:02,570
we provide for the children,

875
00:42:02,670 --> 00:42:04,100
as well as a learning opportunity.

876
00:42:04,830 --> 00:42:06,560
After all, when the children grow up,

877
00:42:06,600 --> 00:42:07,750
if they can't get into college,

878
00:42:07,830 --> 00:42:08,790
they'll have to face society.

879
00:42:09,480 --> 00:42:10,440
This can be considered

880
00:42:10,470 --> 00:42:11,390
a means of livelihood for them.

881
00:42:14,160 --> 00:42:14,990
Are all the children here

882
00:42:15,030 --> 00:42:16,110
good at making these?

883
00:42:16,420 --> 00:42:17,390
Not really.

884
00:42:17,450 --> 00:42:18,950
It's just that Lin Xue was particularly clever

885
00:42:18,990 --> 00:42:20,950
and dexterous. She learned quickly.

886
00:42:21,090 --> 00:42:22,870
She could not only make ordinary ones,

887
00:42:22,910 --> 00:42:24,320
but also weave very complex patterns,

888
00:42:24,350 --> 00:42:25,400
even small animals.

889
00:42:25,660 --> 00:42:26,280
Her works

890
00:42:26,280 --> 00:42:27,510
actually sold for quite a bit of money.

891
00:42:28,340 --> 00:42:30,110
We all liked her.

892
00:42:30,150 --> 00:42:31,390
Whenever someone came to adopt,

893
00:42:31,430 --> 00:42:32,710
we would recommend her.

894
00:42:33,980 --> 00:42:34,940
However,

895
00:42:35,230 --> 00:42:36,840
few people are usually willing to adopt

896
00:42:36,910 --> 00:42:37,830
such a grown child.

897
00:42:38,080 --> 00:42:39,120
They're afraid of the unfamiliarity.

898
00:42:40,230 --> 00:42:42,100
Later, she was adopted

899
00:42:42,150 --> 00:42:43,670
by a divorced mother.

900
00:42:45,590 --> 00:42:47,090
Has something happened to her?

901
00:42:48,670 --> 00:42:50,270
We're just here to gather information.

902
00:42:55,810 --> 00:42:57,140
May I ask you one more question?

903
00:42:59,600 --> 00:43:00,650
Could you take a look at

904
00:43:01,790 --> 00:43:02,760
this person?

905
00:43:03,120 --> 00:43:04,060
Do you remember him?

906
00:43:06,460 --> 00:43:07,350
Yes,

907
00:43:07,470 --> 00:43:09,040
he's also a police officer, right?

908
00:43:10,140 --> 00:43:12,180
I remember a few years ago,

909
00:43:12,200 --> 00:43:14,050
he also came to inquire about Lin Xue's situation.

910
00:43:14,490 --> 00:43:15,590
I told him all of Lin Xue's

911
00:43:15,630 --> 00:43:16,670
identity information.

912
00:43:16,940 --> 00:43:18,150
This information

913
00:43:18,190 --> 00:43:19,350
was verified with her place

914
00:43:19,370 --> 00:43:20,090
of household registration.

915
00:43:26,820 --> 00:43:27,590
Thank you.
