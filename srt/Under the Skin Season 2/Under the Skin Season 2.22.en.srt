00:01:38,759 --> 00:01:43,120
(Under the Skin Ⅱ)

2
00:01:43,490 --> 00:01:46,039
(Episode 22)

3
00:01:49,190 --> 00:01:49,990
Why do you think

4
00:01:49,990 --> 00:01:51,500
the child might be Cao Jian's?

5
00:01:52,030 --> 00:01:53,509
I've noticed that Cao Jian

6
00:01:53,670 --> 00:01:55,110
has a strong reproduction worship.

7
00:01:55,700 --> 00:01:56,880
His clothing and appearance

8
00:01:57,229 --> 00:01:58,550
don't really match the usual look

9
00:01:58,570 --> 00:01:59,550
of his age group,

10
00:02:00,510 --> 00:02:01,910
indicating he refuses to come to terms with his age.

11
00:02:02,630 --> 00:02:04,620
I think it's very likely that

12
00:02:05,150 --> 00:02:06,030
he took Zhou Shanshan for genetic testing

13
00:02:06,030 --> 00:02:06,830
for his own sake.

14
00:02:10,550 --> 00:02:11,550
You know that guy?

15
00:02:13,390 --> 00:02:14,030
Yes.

16
00:02:16,270 --> 00:02:17,710
Are you... Close?

17
00:02:19,470 --> 00:02:20,910
He's kind of a friend to me.

18
00:02:21,110 --> 00:02:22,190
We met at an exhibition.

19
00:02:22,870 --> 00:02:23,829
He bought my painting.

20
00:02:26,590 --> 00:02:27,350
That guy...

21
00:02:28,910 --> 00:02:29,630
Feels weird.

22
00:02:30,030 --> 00:02:30,670
Weird?

23
00:02:30,750 --> 00:02:31,390
How?

24
00:02:35,430 --> 00:02:36,510
He's like someone I know.

25
00:02:37,829 --> 00:02:38,550
Who?

26
00:02:41,110 --> 00:02:41,870
The old you.

27
00:03:08,070 --> 00:03:09,270
What's your relationship with Cao Jian?

28
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:12,620
He's my boyfriend's father.

29
00:03:13,140 --> 00:03:13,940
What else?

30
00:03:19,550 --> 00:03:20,630
You don't think

31
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:22,030
he's interested in me too, do you?

32
00:03:22,350 --> 00:03:23,250
Come on.

33
00:03:23,590 --> 00:03:24,710
Rich men

34
00:03:24,730 --> 00:03:26,650
can get any women they want these days.

35
00:03:27,030 --> 00:03:28,130
Why would he take a liking to me?

36
00:03:28,870 --> 00:03:30,590
I'm not some rare prize.

37
00:03:33,300 --> 00:03:35,070
The relationship between Cao Jian and Liu Yao was tense.

38
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:36,960
Do you know why?

39
00:03:37,950 --> 00:03:38,990
How would I know?

40
00:03:40,630 --> 00:03:41,550
It's certainly not because of me.

41
00:03:42,470 --> 00:03:43,540
So, was it because of Cao Xiaodong?

42
00:03:45,190 --> 00:03:46,390
But Cao Xiaodong

43
00:03:46,430 --> 00:03:48,190
said it was Cao Jian who killed Liu Yao.

44
00:03:49,870 --> 00:03:51,670
What on earth happened between them?

45
00:03:56,300 --> 00:03:57,430
Cao Xiaodong gambles excessively.

46
00:04:00,510 --> 00:04:02,710
Liu Yao had been helping him manage the club

47
00:04:04,030 --> 00:04:05,590
and even paying out of her own pocket to cover his debts.

48
00:04:07,990 --> 00:04:09,150
Cao Jian had lost his temper over this

49
00:04:10,030 --> 00:04:11,350
more than once or twice.

50
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:26,070
(Beijiang Branch, Beijiang City Public Security Bureau)

51
00:04:30,590 --> 00:04:31,710
We went to see your son,

52
00:04:31,750 --> 00:04:32,500
Cao Xiaodong.

53
00:04:33,310 --> 00:04:34,430
He implied to us

54
00:04:34,850 --> 00:04:36,330
that it was you who killed Liu Yao.

55
00:04:42,750 --> 00:04:43,590
It seems

56
00:04:44,970 --> 00:04:46,450
he really hates me.

57
00:04:47,940 --> 00:04:49,300
Why does he hate you?

58
00:04:51,310 --> 00:04:52,230
I did

59
00:04:53,350 --> 00:04:54,870
want to conceal it before.

60
00:04:55,420 --> 00:04:57,110
After all, what happens in the family stays in the family.

61
00:04:57,670 --> 00:04:58,510
Five years ago,

62
00:04:58,790 --> 00:05:00,350
Xiaodong went for a check-up.

63
00:05:01,180 --> 00:05:02,410
He was diagnosed with azoospermia.

64
00:05:03,590 --> 00:05:04,710
In his lifetime,

65
00:05:05,190 --> 00:05:07,110
he'll never be able to have his own children.

66
00:05:07,950 --> 00:05:09,330
I never imagined

67
00:05:09,510 --> 00:05:11,480
that I, Cao Jian, would witness the end of my family line.

68
00:05:13,740 --> 00:05:15,060
But at that time, Liu Yao

69
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:16,470
was also already in her 50s.

70
00:05:17,430 --> 00:05:18,510
If we were to try IVF,

71
00:05:18,510 --> 00:05:19,590
it would also be difficult to succeed.

72
00:05:20,990 --> 00:05:22,580
I didn't want her to suffer either.

73
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:25,400
But Liu Yao cared about her reputation.

74
00:05:25,910 --> 00:05:27,390
She couldn't accept this situation with our son.

75
00:05:28,390 --> 00:05:29,350
She even helped me find

76
00:05:29,380 --> 00:05:30,900
a girl who's willing to do this kind of thing.

77
00:05:32,270 --> 00:05:33,650
But there was only one purpose:

78
00:05:33,950 --> 00:05:35,560
to have a child with my genes.

79
00:05:37,010 --> 00:05:37,840
Nominally,

80
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:39,710
this child would still be Xiaodong's.

81
00:05:40,620 --> 00:05:41,880
We would be the grandparents.

82
00:05:46,710 --> 00:05:47,790
So

83
00:05:49,510 --> 00:05:51,310
the child in Zhou Shanshan's womb

84
00:05:51,750 --> 00:05:53,159
is actually yours?

85
00:05:54,150 --> 00:05:54,750
Yes.

86
00:06:03,730 --> 00:06:05,020
So,

87
00:06:05,540 --> 00:06:07,430
does Cao Xiaodong know about this

88
00:06:08,270 --> 00:06:09,150
and accept it?

89
00:06:10,980 --> 00:06:12,350
He has never been able to accept it.

90
00:06:13,230 --> 00:06:13,710
He thinks

91
00:06:13,710 --> 00:06:15,110
it's a humiliation to him.

92
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:16,470
How could this be humiliation?

93
00:06:17,310 --> 00:06:18,390
This is the best solution

94
00:06:18,410 --> 00:06:20,070
I could think of.

95
00:06:25,950 --> 00:06:26,790
Things

96
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:29,590
have already come to this point.

97
00:06:31,270 --> 00:06:32,180
Officers.

98
00:06:33,870 --> 00:06:35,710
If Liu Yao was really killed by him,

99
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:41,320
I can only accept it.

100
00:06:48,300 --> 00:06:49,760
Let me confirm with you again.

101
00:06:51,110 --> 00:06:53,320
You were just accusing your son,

102
00:06:53,510 --> 00:06:54,510
Cao Xiaodong,

103
00:06:55,490 --> 00:06:57,320
of killing your wife, Liu Yao.

104
00:06:58,420 --> 00:06:58,950
Is that correct?

105
00:07:04,130 --> 00:07:04,740
Yes.

106
00:07:40,430 --> 00:07:41,710
The Sphinx?

107
00:07:43,070 --> 00:07:43,630
Yes.

108
00:07:44,950 --> 00:07:46,070
The Sphinx.

109
00:07:46,790 --> 00:07:48,190
She is a mythical creature

110
00:07:48,510 --> 00:07:49,960
with the body of a lion,

111
00:07:50,190 --> 00:07:51,150
the head of a human,

112
00:07:51,450 --> 00:07:52,560
and the wings of an eagle.

113
00:07:53,750 --> 00:07:55,430
She was sent to Thebes

114
00:07:56,159 --> 00:07:57,590
to pose a riddle

115
00:07:57,740 --> 00:07:58,510
to the inhabitants there,

116
00:07:58,510 --> 00:08:00,070
a question difficult to answer:

117
00:08:00,790 --> 00:08:02,350
"What creature

118
00:08:02,950 --> 00:08:04,150
walks on four legs in the morning,

119
00:08:05,030 --> 00:08:06,590
two legs at noon,

120
00:08:06,590 --> 00:08:07,310
and three legs in the evening?"

121
00:08:13,030 --> 00:08:14,350
Oedipus answered,

122
00:08:14,990 --> 00:08:15,830
"This creature

123
00:08:16,750 --> 00:08:17,630
is human."

124
00:08:19,220 --> 00:08:19,600
(Artist)

125
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:20,990
This man is Oedipus.
(Artist)

126
00:08:20,990 --> 00:08:22,390
(Artist)

127
00:08:26,620 --> 00:08:27,500
Freud,

128
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:28,710
using the Greek myth

129
00:08:28,710 --> 00:08:29,750
of Oedipus Rex,

130
00:08:29,830 --> 00:08:30,990
created a concept

131
00:08:32,590 --> 00:08:34,059
called the Oedipus complex.

132
00:08:34,710 --> 00:08:36,510
He believed that a boy's love for his mother and hatred for his father

133
00:08:37,390 --> 00:08:38,429
is an instinct.

134
00:08:43,110 --> 00:08:43,950
So,

135
00:08:44,870 --> 00:08:47,020
you think Cao Xiaodong has the Oedipus complex?

136
00:08:52,550 --> 00:08:54,190
Liu Yao's family was wealthy.

137
00:08:55,070 --> 00:08:56,230
Cao Xiaodong has always believed that

138
00:08:56,230 --> 00:08:57,710
his father, Cao Jian,

139
00:08:57,780 --> 00:08:59,540
is a despicable social climber.

140
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:02,720
As Cao Jian's power grew,

141
00:09:03,990 --> 00:09:06,270
Liu Yao's attitude also changed.

142
00:09:06,990 --> 00:09:08,070
She deliberately reinforced

143
00:09:08,090 --> 00:09:09,440
Cao Xiaodong's subconscious desire

144
00:09:09,550 --> 00:09:10,990
to replace his father and reclaim the family fortune.

145
00:09:11,870 --> 00:09:12,910
But when this desire

146
00:09:13,030 --> 00:09:14,550
reached its peak,

147
00:09:15,430 --> 00:09:17,750
his male ego was completely destroyed.

148
00:09:20,610 --> 00:09:22,660
And he learned that the mastermind behind this

149
00:09:23,190 --> 00:09:24,310
was his mother, Liu Yao.

150
00:09:25,310 --> 00:09:26,790
So the deep mother-son bond

151
00:09:27,150 --> 00:09:28,510
turned into hatred and matricide.

152
00:09:33,270 --> 00:09:34,500
But we didn't find

153
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:35,670
any evidence of Cao Xiaodong's murder at the scene.

154
00:09:39,110 --> 00:09:39,750
The entire house

155
00:09:39,750 --> 00:09:40,870
has been searched thoroughly.

156
00:09:41,750 --> 00:09:42,910
What else are you trying to find?

157
00:09:51,630 --> 00:09:52,510
Do you have a flashlight?

158
00:10:28,270 --> 00:10:29,200
This painting

159
00:10:30,150 --> 00:10:31,340
is a modern replica.

160
00:10:33,230 --> 00:10:35,390
The paints used are standard commercially available ones.

161
00:10:42,100 --> 00:10:43,830
But these paint fragments underneath

162
00:10:46,030 --> 00:10:47,550
belong to another painting.

163
00:10:48,030 --> 00:10:49,950
It's from the true Renaissance period,

164
00:10:50,030 --> 00:10:51,110
called Tempera paint.

165
00:10:52,430 --> 00:10:53,510
It's made from egg whites

166
00:10:54,390 --> 00:10:55,550
and pigments.

167
00:11:15,910 --> 00:11:16,900
The painting has been replaced,

168
00:11:18,190 --> 00:11:19,530
and it happened not long ago.

169
00:11:22,150 --> 00:11:23,030
I suspect that

170
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:25,230
the painting

171
00:11:25,230 --> 00:11:26,080
that originally hung here

172
00:11:27,300 --> 00:11:28,630
might have some clues on it.

173
00:11:30,390 --> 00:11:30,900
During this time,

174
00:11:30,900 --> 00:11:32,430
the entire house has been sealed off.

175
00:11:33,870 --> 00:11:34,510
Something that big

176
00:11:34,550 --> 00:11:35,510
couldn't have been taken out.

177
00:11:37,430 --> 00:11:38,550
So that painting

178
00:11:39,550 --> 00:11:40,630
must still be here.

179
00:12:18,950 --> 00:12:19,560
Du Cheng.

180
00:12:57,120 --> 00:12:57,990
The painting that was replaced

181
00:12:57,990 --> 00:12:59,150
should be this one.

182
00:13:19,750 --> 00:13:20,590
Why are you here?

183
00:13:25,750 --> 00:13:26,910
I'm asking you to leave.

184
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:29,260
Otherwise, I'll call the police.

185
00:13:33,300 --> 00:13:34,120
Security.

186
00:13:35,640 --> 00:13:36,560
Escort him out.

187
00:13:37,250 --> 00:13:39,280
You master's lackeys.

188
00:13:46,030 --> 00:13:46,750
Take your money

189
00:13:47,390 --> 00:13:47,890
and get out.

190
00:13:47,970 --> 00:13:49,450
Cao Xiaodong, have you lost your mind?

191
00:13:50,270 --> 00:13:50,920
Call the police.

192
00:13:53,260 --> 00:13:54,530
You dare call the police?

193
00:13:54,830 --> 00:13:56,550
Do you believe I'll kill her right now?

194
00:13:58,590 --> 00:13:59,850
If you know what's good for you, get out.

195
00:13:59,910 --> 00:14:01,510
Mr. Cao. Please don't make it difficult for me, Mr. Cao.

196
00:14:01,950 --> 00:14:02,600
Get out!

197
00:14:03,030 --> 00:14:03,590
Come back!

198
00:14:03,990 --> 00:14:05,190
You too, come out!

199
00:14:05,790 --> 00:14:06,330
Get out!

200
00:14:08,890 --> 00:14:09,550
You bitch!

201
00:14:09,550 --> 00:14:10,830
Find Cao Jian! Call the police!

202
00:14:10,830 --> 00:14:11,930
You dare play me like this?

203
00:14:12,910 --> 00:14:14,700
You think you've succeeded?

204
00:14:16,450 --> 00:14:18,160
You all deceived me, huh?

205
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,510
You all betrayed me, huh?

206
00:14:33,230 --> 00:14:34,020
I'm sorry.

207
00:14:34,790 --> 00:14:35,950
Mr. Cao Jr.

208
00:14:36,830 --> 00:14:37,680
I'm sorry.

209
00:14:38,460 --> 00:14:39,440
Mr. Cao Jr.

210
00:14:39,460 --> 00:14:40,330
I was wrong.

211
00:14:40,990 --> 00:14:41,710
I was wrong.

212
00:14:42,790 --> 00:14:44,230
Still trying to run?

213
00:14:44,670 --> 00:14:46,150
Still trying to run, huh?

214
00:14:46,230 --> 00:14:47,350
Still trying to run?

215
00:14:48,950 --> 00:14:50,200
You lied to me.

216
00:14:50,820 --> 00:14:51,430
No.

217
00:14:51,540 --> 00:14:52,360
It wasn't me.

218
00:14:53,270 --> 00:14:54,260
It was your mother.

219
00:14:56,310 --> 00:14:57,910
You all dare to play me.

220
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:04,870
None of you will live.

221
00:15:05,250 --> 00:15:07,930
Let Cao Jian's child go to hell!

222
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:09,660
Don't kill me.

223
00:15:10,110 --> 00:15:11,070
The child, I...

224
00:15:11,090 --> 00:15:12,080
I can do without.

225
00:15:12,540 --> 00:15:13,630
I'm begging you.

226
00:15:13,790 --> 00:15:14,760
I'm begging you.

227
00:15:16,960 --> 00:15:18,000
-Stop!
-Freeze!

228
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,000
Cao Xiaodong, stop!

229
00:15:20,290 --> 00:15:21,130
-Stop!
-Freeze!

230
00:15:21,150 --> 00:15:22,090
Let go!

231
00:15:24,270 --> 00:15:25,100
Hold him down!

232
00:15:26,100 --> 00:15:26,700
Cuff him!

233
00:15:28,430 --> 00:15:29,250
Don't move!

234
00:15:33,540 --> 00:15:37,410
(Beijiang Branch, Beijiang City Public Security Bureau)

235
00:15:40,310 --> 00:15:41,430
We found

236
00:15:43,460 --> 00:15:44,700
Liu Yao's blood on this painting,

237
00:15:46,340 --> 00:15:47,700
as well as your fingerprints.

238
00:15:53,270 --> 00:15:54,550
Is Zhou Shanshan dead?

239
00:15:55,670 --> 00:15:56,350
No.

240
00:15:58,870 --> 00:15:59,670
What about the child?

241
00:16:01,270 --> 00:16:02,070
Not either.

242
00:16:06,430 --> 00:16:08,250
Cao Jian still succeeded.

243
00:16:25,480 --> 00:16:27,550
Sphinx.

244
00:16:28,660 --> 00:16:30,390
Why did you paint my mother as her?

245
00:16:34,350 --> 00:16:35,680
You loved your mother very much,

246
00:16:37,230 --> 00:16:38,790
but your mother betrayed you.

247
00:16:46,120 --> 00:16:47,310
My family

248
00:16:48,850 --> 00:16:50,760
is different from normal families.

249
00:16:52,350 --> 00:16:54,310
Since I was little, my mother has always told me

250
00:16:55,740 --> 00:16:57,630
that I must be excellent enough

251
00:16:58,500 --> 00:17:00,110
to inherit the family business.

252
00:17:02,230 --> 00:17:03,200
Otherwise,

253
00:17:04,680 --> 00:17:05,990
what I deserve

254
00:17:07,819 --> 00:17:09,540
will be taken away by others.

255
00:17:17,670 --> 00:17:18,490
Mom.

256
00:17:27,099 --> 00:17:27,760
Mom.

257
00:17:29,270 --> 00:17:30,250
What's wrong?

258
00:17:33,490 --> 00:17:34,780
That bastard Cao Jian

259
00:17:35,660 --> 00:17:36,990
wants to blow you and me off

260
00:17:37,070 --> 00:17:38,430
with this club.

261
00:17:39,150 --> 00:17:40,600
As for all other businesses,

262
00:17:40,750 --> 00:17:42,030
we're not allowed to touch at all.

263
00:17:43,270 --> 00:17:43,820
Mom.

264
00:17:44,150 --> 00:17:46,230
Cao Jian built his fortune on our family.

265
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:48,350
You can't tolerate this anymore.

266
00:17:53,950 --> 00:17:55,510
I'm planning to divorce Cao Jian.

267
00:17:57,510 --> 00:17:59,480
I've hired the best divorce lawyer.

268
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:01,870
According to his estimation,

269
00:18:01,910 --> 00:18:02,920
our divorce case

270
00:18:02,950 --> 00:18:04,070
will take at least three years.

271
00:18:06,110 --> 00:18:07,620
Besides keeping a close eye on Cao Jian

272
00:18:07,660 --> 00:18:08,750
to prevent him from transferring assets

273
00:18:08,890 --> 00:18:10,340
during this period,

274
00:18:11,470 --> 00:18:13,240
there's another way, that is

275
00:18:15,950 --> 00:18:17,670
you have to have a child quickly.

276
00:18:18,550 --> 00:18:19,590
As soon as possible.

277
00:18:20,170 --> 00:18:21,630
This way, there will be one more person

278
00:18:21,860 --> 00:18:23,540
to share Cao Jian's assets.

279
00:18:24,770 --> 00:18:25,380
Mom.

280
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:28,270
But you know

281
00:18:29,320 --> 00:18:30,550
I can't.

282
00:18:30,750 --> 00:18:31,590
I know.

283
00:18:31,670 --> 00:18:32,550
I know, Son.

284
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:34,270
I've already

285
00:18:34,750 --> 00:18:35,310
found a girl

286
00:18:35,310 --> 00:18:36,430
for you here.

287
00:18:36,550 --> 00:18:37,720
Her name is Zhou Shanshan.

288
00:18:38,500 --> 00:18:39,880
She's a graduate student,

289
00:18:39,950 --> 00:18:41,030
very smart.

290
00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:43,330
And I'll find a young man out there

291
00:18:43,430 --> 00:18:44,750
who looks similar to you,

292
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,390
with good education

293
00:18:46,430 --> 00:18:48,110
and personality.

294
00:18:48,340 --> 00:18:50,100
Let's have Zhou Shanshan give birth as soon as possible.

295
00:18:51,510 --> 00:18:52,820
We'll tell others that you got her pregnant

296
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:54,760
when you were drunk and fooling around.

297
00:18:54,790 --> 00:18:55,310
This way,

298
00:18:55,430 --> 00:18:56,350
no one will be able to find

299
00:18:56,350 --> 00:18:57,310
any fault.

300
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:10,920
Hello, Mr. Cao Jr.

301
00:19:11,620 --> 00:19:12,870
I'm Zhou Shanshan.

302
00:19:13,180 --> 00:19:14,890
I will definitely complete the task well.

303
00:19:15,390 --> 00:19:16,340
I won't say anything.

304
00:19:30,230 --> 00:19:31,600
She just had a prenatal check-up.

305
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:33,640
It's almost 12 weeks now.

306
00:19:35,070 --> 00:19:36,510
I rented a house for her

307
00:19:36,790 --> 00:19:38,060
and hired a nanny.

308
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:38,960
From now on,

309
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:40,110
don't come here anymore.

310
00:19:40,830 --> 00:19:42,430
Stay home and take good care of yourself.

311
00:19:43,390 --> 00:19:44,440
Okay, Ms. Liu.

312
00:19:58,270 --> 00:19:59,800
Go buy some nice clothes.

313
00:20:00,170 --> 00:20:01,850
Dress up well when you go out.

314
00:20:02,660 --> 00:20:03,940
Don't embarrass me.

315
00:20:04,310 --> 00:20:05,040
Thank you.

316
00:20:05,630 --> 00:20:06,390
Mr. Cao Jr.

317
00:20:11,790 --> 00:20:13,660
Everything was planned out.

318
00:20:14,760 --> 00:20:15,870
My mother and I

319
00:20:15,910 --> 00:20:17,340
only needed to wait patiently

320
00:20:17,910 --> 00:20:19,610
to settle accounts with Cao Jian.

321
00:20:21,100 --> 00:20:22,480
But my mother started visiting

322
00:20:22,510 --> 00:20:23,710
Zhou Shanshan more and more frequently.

323
00:20:26,750 --> 00:20:29,080
I didn't expect that I underestimated human nature.

324
00:20:29,500 --> 00:20:30,850
Have more fruit.

325
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:32,510
It's good for the baby.

326
00:20:32,630 --> 00:20:33,200
It's sweet.

327
00:20:33,220 --> 00:20:33,950
Try some too.

328
00:20:33,990 --> 00:20:34,500
Okay.

329
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:41,790
Xiaodong.

330
00:20:43,750 --> 00:20:44,870
What are you doing here?

331
00:20:49,650 --> 00:20:51,030
You're so drunk.

332
00:20:54,180 --> 00:20:55,740
What if the smell of alcohol affects Shanshan?

333
00:20:58,040 --> 00:20:59,420
Get up.

334
00:21:03,220 --> 00:21:04,300
Shanshan?

335
00:21:05,460 --> 00:21:06,280
Mom.

336
00:21:07,070 --> 00:21:08,580
When did you two

337
00:21:10,070 --> 00:21:11,740
become so close?

338
00:21:13,340 --> 00:21:14,300
Xiaodong.

339
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:16,190
Shanshan is now practically

340
00:21:16,190 --> 00:21:17,270
part of the family.

341
00:21:17,560 --> 00:21:19,480
Besides, taking good care of Shanshan

342
00:21:20,070 --> 00:21:20,670
is also for the sake of

343
00:21:20,710 --> 00:21:22,070
your child, isn't it?

344
00:21:22,670 --> 00:21:23,610
Mr. Cao Jr.

345
00:21:24,190 --> 00:21:25,430
Maybe you should go back to the club.

346
00:21:26,190 --> 00:21:27,440
The food and drinks here

347
00:21:27,460 --> 00:21:28,330
are too bland

348
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:29,570
for your taste.

349
00:21:30,670 --> 00:21:31,520
Besides,

350
00:21:31,590 --> 00:21:32,580
I need to go to bed soon.

351
00:21:33,540 --> 00:21:35,360
Stop pretending in front of me!

352
00:21:36,110 --> 00:21:36,910
Xiaodong, you...

353
00:21:43,750 --> 00:21:46,200
You have to do exactly as I say.

354
00:21:47,870 --> 00:21:48,550
Fine.

355
00:21:49,910 --> 00:21:51,300
I don't want the child anymore.

356
00:21:51,940 --> 00:21:53,190
Go abort it tomorrow.

357
00:21:53,230 --> 00:21:54,110
Xiaodong!

358
00:21:54,130 --> 00:21:55,360
What are you talking about?

359
00:21:55,630 --> 00:21:56,390
Cao Xiaodong.

360
00:21:56,730 --> 00:21:58,220
Get ahold of yourself.

361
00:21:59,620 --> 00:22:01,180
You're the ones begging me.

362
00:22:03,640 --> 00:22:04,310
Let's go.

363
00:22:05,110 --> 00:22:05,980
Aunt Liu.

364
00:22:06,190 --> 00:22:07,110
Take him away.

365
00:22:07,340 --> 00:22:08,090
Okay.

366
00:22:08,170 --> 00:22:09,550
Rest early.

367
00:22:09,750 --> 00:22:10,910
Why are you pretending in front of me?

368
00:22:10,940 --> 00:22:12,310
You eat my food, use my things, live in my place,

369
00:22:12,660 --> 00:22:14,120
and you dare to talk to me like this?

370
00:22:14,270 --> 00:22:15,110
Go rest.

371
00:22:15,110 --> 00:22:15,710
I'll beat you to death!

372
00:22:15,710 --> 00:22:16,270
Xiaodong!

373
00:22:16,670 --> 00:22:17,550
What are you doing?

374
00:22:17,670 --> 00:22:18,270
This plan...

375
00:22:18,270 --> 00:22:18,830
Let's go.

376
00:22:18,850 --> 00:22:20,520
Gradually got out of control.

377
00:22:21,910 --> 00:22:23,000
I was also starting to lose sight of

378
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:24,070
my own place in all this.

379
00:22:26,790 --> 00:22:27,810
My mother

380
00:22:30,330 --> 00:22:32,150
seemed to no longer belong to me either.

381
00:22:33,710 --> 00:22:35,490
The child is Cao Jian's?

382
00:22:36,910 --> 00:22:37,710
Are you lying to me,

383
00:22:37,750 --> 00:22:39,380
or is Zhou Shanshan lying to you?

384
00:22:39,670 --> 00:22:41,780
I had everything arranged,

385
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:43,070
but I don't know

386
00:22:43,070 --> 00:22:43,950
how Cao Jian found out about

387
00:22:43,950 --> 00:22:44,980
our plan.

388
00:22:48,460 --> 00:22:49,150
He must have had someone

389
00:22:49,150 --> 00:22:50,400
do it secretly

390
00:22:50,420 --> 00:22:51,760
when I wasn't paying attention.

391
00:22:52,270 --> 00:22:52,990
It's only because

392
00:22:52,990 --> 00:22:53,790
I've been nice to Zhou Shanshan

393
00:22:53,790 --> 00:22:54,830
that she told me everything.

394
00:22:54,850 --> 00:22:56,360
Otherwise, when this child is born,

395
00:22:56,830 --> 00:22:57,590
there will be one more person

396
00:22:57,630 --> 00:22:58,830
fighting with you for the inheritance.

397
00:22:59,040 --> 00:22:59,780
This can't do.

398
00:23:00,570 --> 00:23:02,200
This child must be aborted.

399
00:23:02,660 --> 00:23:03,510
Talk to her

400
00:23:03,670 --> 00:23:04,510
and give her some more money.

401
00:23:04,530 --> 00:23:06,090
You think I haven't talked to her?

402
00:23:07,100 --> 00:23:09,240
Zhou Shanshan is very clever.

403
00:23:10,350 --> 00:23:11,500
She knows very well that

404
00:23:12,430 --> 00:23:14,230
Cao Jian will give her more money than us.

405
00:24:35,470 --> 00:24:36,680
Hitting Zhou Shanshan with a car,

406
00:24:36,680 --> 00:24:38,070
you had someone do it, didn't you?

407
00:24:40,710 --> 00:24:41,490
Xiaodong.

408
00:24:42,700 --> 00:24:44,030
I can

409
00:24:44,030 --> 00:24:45,390
understand how you feel.

410
00:24:46,590 --> 00:24:49,150
But it's not a car

411
00:24:49,550 --> 00:24:51,260
that you can simply discard.

412
00:24:51,640 --> 00:24:53,430
It's a life we're talking about.

413
00:24:56,920 --> 00:24:57,870
If you want to blame someone,

414
00:24:58,220 --> 00:24:59,210
blame your father.

415
00:24:59,710 --> 00:25:00,470
He's so despicable.

416
00:25:01,230 --> 00:25:02,220
For money,

417
00:25:02,350 --> 00:25:03,830
he's capable of anything.

418
00:25:06,900 --> 00:25:07,710
But don't

419
00:25:07,710 --> 00:25:09,190
give up at this point.

420
00:25:09,710 --> 00:25:11,550
Accept this child first.

421
00:25:12,030 --> 00:25:14,910
After all, to the outside world, you are the child's father.

422
00:25:14,980 --> 00:25:16,830
Cao Jian won't abandon you.

423
00:25:17,350 --> 00:25:18,230
In the future,

424
00:25:18,990 --> 00:25:20,070
you'll have everything.

425
00:25:28,280 --> 00:25:29,740
Have you considered

426
00:25:31,810 --> 00:25:34,000
my dignity as a man?

427
00:25:36,800 --> 00:25:38,640
Money is what gives you dignity.

428
00:25:39,320 --> 00:25:40,680
Don't overthink things.

429
00:25:42,500 --> 00:25:44,010
Stop drinking.

430
00:25:44,470 --> 00:25:45,750
Try to relax a bit.

431
00:25:46,710 --> 00:25:47,830
Get some good sleep,

432
00:25:48,830 --> 00:25:49,400
okay?

433
00:26:36,110 --> 00:26:37,370
Cao Xiaodong.

434
00:26:37,400 --> 00:26:38,870
Get ahold of yourself.

435
00:26:40,180 --> 00:26:42,030
You're the ones begging me.

436
00:26:46,870 --> 00:26:48,510
You need to have a child as soon as possible

437
00:26:48,890 --> 00:26:50,600
to take a bigger share of Cao Jian's property.

438
00:26:52,010 --> 00:26:53,940
The child is Cao Jian's?

439
00:26:54,230 --> 00:26:55,230
Are you lying to me,

440
00:26:55,230 --> 00:26:56,870
or is Zhou Shanshan lying to you?

441
00:26:57,700 --> 00:26:59,340
Accept this child first.

442
00:26:59,870 --> 00:27:01,060
After all, to the outside world,

443
00:27:01,080 --> 00:27:03,190
you are this child's father.

444
00:27:04,560 --> 00:27:06,160
Have you considered

445
00:27:06,200 --> 00:27:08,140
my dignity as a man?

446
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:11,340
Money is what gives you dignity.

447
00:27:13,100 --> 00:27:14,150
If you want to blame someone,

448
00:27:14,370 --> 00:27:17,050
blame your father for being so despicable.

449
00:27:17,420 --> 00:27:18,460
For money,

450
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:19,920
he's capable of anything.

451
00:27:38,870 --> 00:27:40,110
Didn't I tell you already?

452
00:27:40,150 --> 00:27:41,630
Stop drinking.

453
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:45,780
Look at yourself. What a mess.

454
00:27:47,910 --> 00:27:48,910
Look at yourself.

455
00:27:48,910 --> 00:27:49,700
What a mess.

456
00:27:50,950 --> 00:27:52,030
Look at yourself.

457
00:27:52,030 --> 00:27:52,860
What a mess.

458
00:27:52,970 --> 00:27:53,910
Look at yourself.

459
00:27:53,910 --> 00:27:54,750
Look at yourself.

460
00:27:54,750 --> 00:27:55,760
Look at yourself.

461
00:27:55,790 --> 00:27:56,360
Look at yourself.

462
00:27:56,390 --> 00:27:57,470
Look at yourself.

463
00:28:02,370 --> 00:28:03,420
Xiaodong!

464
00:28:05,110 --> 00:28:05,930
Xiaodong...

465
00:28:07,540 --> 00:28:09,360
Mom, why is it you?

466
00:28:15,020 --> 00:28:15,690
Mom!

467
00:28:19,460 --> 00:28:20,170
Press on it.

468
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:21,780
I'll call an ambulance.

469
00:28:25,020 --> 00:28:25,940
Xiaodong.

470
00:28:27,140 --> 00:28:29,150
You knew everything, didn't you?

471
00:28:30,330 --> 00:28:32,390
Mom, stop talking.

472
00:28:32,510 --> 00:28:33,510
Zhou Shanshan...

473
00:28:34,500 --> 00:28:37,990
Zhou Shanshan's child is our bargaining chip.

474
00:28:39,090 --> 00:28:39,900
Mom.

475
00:28:40,510 --> 00:28:41,510
What are you talking about?

476
00:28:47,380 --> 00:28:50,060
The child must be

477
00:28:50,110 --> 00:28:51,950
of the Cao family bloodline.

478
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:56,920
Only then can we achieve our plan.

479
00:28:58,100 --> 00:29:00,620
But you can't have children.

480
00:29:01,680 --> 00:29:05,020
I had no choice

481
00:29:05,070 --> 00:29:06,630
but to do this.

482
00:29:09,160 --> 00:29:10,150
Mom.

483
00:29:12,080 --> 00:29:13,290
I thought

484
00:29:14,510 --> 00:29:16,730
even if the whole world betrayed me,

485
00:29:16,760 --> 00:29:17,770
you would still

486
00:29:17,950 --> 00:29:19,310
be on my side.

487
00:29:20,110 --> 00:29:21,050
It turns out

488
00:29:21,740 --> 00:29:23,830
this was all calculated by you.

489
00:29:25,920 --> 00:29:27,540
I'm the real fool here.

490
00:29:29,450 --> 00:29:30,010
No.

491
00:29:31,750 --> 00:29:33,560
We both love you very much.

492
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:35,980
Love you so much.

493
00:29:39,130 --> 00:29:40,440
Take this.

494
00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:42,780
Give the bracelet

495
00:29:42,920 --> 00:29:45,100
to Zhou Shanshan.

496
00:29:48,860 --> 00:29:50,200
Ask her to go to America

497
00:29:50,280 --> 00:29:51,520
with you.

498
00:29:53,150 --> 00:29:55,920
After all, her child

499
00:29:56,130 --> 00:29:58,770
is your biological brother.

500
00:30:00,400 --> 00:30:01,700
Live on.

501
00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:05,700
Live on.

502
00:30:06,400 --> 00:30:06,960
Mom.

503
00:30:13,630 --> 00:30:14,400
Mom.

504
00:30:16,340 --> 00:30:17,110
Mom.

505
00:30:19,830 --> 00:30:20,340
Mom!

506
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:25,070
Mom!

507
00:30:45,650 --> 00:30:46,930
You probably have known

508
00:30:50,120 --> 00:30:51,570
what happened afterwards.

509
00:30:55,750 --> 00:30:57,190
You found Ji Jun to take the fall.

510
00:31:00,640 --> 00:31:01,300
Yes.

511
00:31:06,950 --> 00:31:08,730
You drew it very much like my mother.

512
00:31:11,220 --> 00:31:12,800
I thought I loved her very much.

513
00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:15,630
But actually,

514
00:31:17,350 --> 00:31:18,390
I hated her too.

515
00:31:19,910 --> 00:31:21,350
I didn't even realize it myself,

516
00:31:25,950 --> 00:31:27,670
yet you saw through it.

517
00:31:30,420 --> 00:31:31,590
You inspired me.

518
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:45,110
The externalization of the subconscious.

519
00:31:49,180 --> 00:31:51,550
It turns out that everything can be traced.

520
00:32:03,770 --> 00:32:05,230
The father dislikes the son,

521
00:32:05,850 --> 00:32:07,340
the son resents the father,

522
00:32:07,750 --> 00:32:09,360
while the father and mother plot against each other.

523
00:32:09,990 --> 00:32:11,510
What a messed up family relationship.

524
00:32:13,120 --> 00:32:14,680
Disassemble complicated human nature

525
00:32:15,150 --> 00:32:16,230
and categorize it.

526
00:32:17,150 --> 00:32:18,110
That's why

527
00:32:18,110 --> 00:32:19,510
I want to do Human Nature Atlas.

528
00:32:21,350 --> 00:32:21,990
I want to apply

529
00:32:21,990 --> 00:32:23,310
to visit some felons.

530
00:32:26,830 --> 00:32:27,540
Why?

531
00:32:29,190 --> 00:32:30,270
Because I need a lot of

532
00:32:30,270 --> 00:32:30,990
samples of complexion.

533
00:32:31,310 --> 00:32:32,030
Shen Yi.

534
00:32:32,150 --> 00:32:33,640
You can do research,

535
00:32:33,990 --> 00:32:35,170
but you can't act rashly.

536
00:32:35,270 --> 00:32:35,870
Don't forget,

537
00:32:36,760 --> 00:32:38,740
you just let go of your emotions about the Little Red Dress.

538
00:34:47,699 --> 00:34:49,260
What brings you here, Shen Yi?

539
00:34:49,630 --> 00:34:51,260
I came to talk to you about criminal genes.

540
00:34:57,950 --> 00:34:58,870
Is this Cao Jian's?

541
00:35:02,350 --> 00:35:03,270
How did you know?

542
00:35:05,230 --> 00:35:06,150
I didn't label it.

543
00:35:08,020 --> 00:35:09,980
I feel that for the one on the left,

544
00:35:10,110 --> 00:35:11,030
its form itself

545
00:35:11,030 --> 00:35:12,790
is in harmony with the surrounding ecology.

546
00:35:13,260 --> 00:35:14,700
But the one on the right

547
00:35:14,980 --> 00:35:16,680
has a visible,

548
00:35:16,740 --> 00:35:17,870
uncontrollable

549
00:35:17,930 --> 00:35:20,140
desire for expansion and aggression,

550
00:35:20,470 --> 00:35:23,110
compressing the surrounding ecosystem

551
00:35:23,230 --> 00:35:24,390
and disrupting its balance.

552
00:35:25,870 --> 00:35:26,710
This is very similar

553
00:35:26,750 --> 00:35:27,910
to the feeling I get from Cao Jian.

554
00:35:30,550 --> 00:35:32,030
The one on the right is Cao Jian's

555
00:35:32,030 --> 00:35:33,270
monoamine oxidase A gene.

556
00:35:34,300 --> 00:35:35,360
The one on the left

557
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:36,990
is the unaltered

558
00:35:37,070 --> 00:35:38,190
monoamine oxidase A gene.

559
00:35:41,470 --> 00:35:42,350
Amazing.

560
00:35:43,630 --> 00:35:44,430
Can you, like us

561
00:35:44,430 --> 00:35:45,550
who work with genes,

562
00:35:46,360 --> 00:35:47,830
see the seeds of evil in him?

563
00:35:51,620 --> 00:35:52,270
I don't know.

564
00:35:55,660 --> 00:35:57,440
Cao Xiaodong's genes are also of this kind.

565
00:35:57,870 --> 00:35:58,470
Lombroso, hailed as

566
00:35:58,470 --> 00:36:00,640
the father of criminology,

567
00:36:00,790 --> 00:36:01,630
introduced natural sciences

568
00:36:01,790 --> 00:36:03,540
into criminology research.

569
00:36:04,310 --> 00:36:05,910
After observing hundreds

570
00:36:05,990 --> 00:36:07,550
of criminals, he proposed that

571
00:36:07,680 --> 00:36:08,920
the fundamental cause of crime

572
00:36:09,030 --> 00:36:10,550
is determined by biological

573
00:36:10,550 --> 00:36:11,470
and hereditary factors.

574
00:36:12,710 --> 00:36:13,760
There's an old Chinese saying,

575
00:36:14,030 --> 00:36:15,590
"Like father, like son."

576
00:36:16,230 --> 00:36:17,630
In human genetics,

577
00:36:18,630 --> 00:36:20,150
sons have a high probability

578
00:36:20,550 --> 00:36:21,390
of inheriting

579
00:36:21,430 --> 00:36:22,750
their father's genetic defects,

580
00:36:23,360 --> 00:36:24,820
leading to the same tragedy

581
00:36:25,030 --> 00:36:26,910
repeating across generations.

582
00:36:27,590 --> 00:36:28,830
The relationship between adult fathers and sons

583
00:36:28,910 --> 00:36:30,070
is more like that of competitors,

584
00:36:30,990 --> 00:36:31,740
competing for

585
00:36:32,170 --> 00:36:33,650
the society's disposable resources.

586
00:36:36,460 --> 00:36:37,390
It's like

587
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:39,590
the succession of male lions

588
00:36:40,070 --> 00:36:41,070
in a pride of lions.

589
00:36:41,830 --> 00:36:42,310
Yes.

590
00:36:43,550 --> 00:36:44,830
Male lions rarely hunt,

591
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:46,120
but they dominate

592
00:36:46,150 --> 00:36:47,620
the breeding rights of the entire pride.

593
00:36:48,030 --> 00:36:49,950
Lionesses depend on the family

594
00:36:50,830 --> 00:36:52,150
and submit only to the strongest.

595
00:36:52,510 --> 00:36:54,470
Apart from resisting external groups,

596
00:36:54,720 --> 00:36:56,230
male lions only need to focus on

597
00:36:56,590 --> 00:36:57,390
the threats posed by

598
00:36:57,510 --> 00:36:59,430
young individuals within the pride.

599
00:36:59,990 --> 00:37:01,470
All known organisms,

600
00:37:02,190 --> 00:37:04,070
regardless of their reproductive mode,

601
00:37:05,030 --> 00:37:06,810
have survival strategies determined

602
00:37:06,870 --> 00:37:08,270
by their species' genetic inheritance.

603
00:37:15,230 --> 00:37:16,190
Do you remember

604
00:37:18,100 --> 00:37:19,160
that girl I told you about,

605
00:37:19,190 --> 00:37:20,320
the one who gave me

606
00:37:20,320 --> 00:37:20,990
a special feeling?

607
00:37:22,550 --> 00:37:23,430
I saw in the news.

608
00:37:25,750 --> 00:37:28,390
Being a police officer is a dangerous occupation.

609
00:37:30,070 --> 00:37:31,950
You may risk your life anytime.

610
00:37:33,340 --> 00:37:34,400
I still want to advise you

611
00:37:35,350 --> 00:37:37,020
to reconsider your occupation.

612
00:37:43,910 --> 00:37:44,960
But I did it.

613
00:37:46,870 --> 00:37:47,630
This time,

614
00:37:48,830 --> 00:37:49,910
I successfully predicted

615
00:37:49,910 --> 00:37:50,870
her criminal personality.

616
00:37:52,040 --> 00:37:53,070
So now,

617
00:37:53,990 --> 00:37:55,230
I'm even more determined

618
00:37:55,460 --> 00:37:56,320
to continue working on

619
00:37:56,350 --> 00:37:57,350
the Criminal Human Nature Atlas.

620
00:37:58,830 --> 00:38:01,200
Combining art and psychology,

621
00:38:01,860 --> 00:38:03,070
I want to use painting

622
00:38:03,260 --> 00:38:04,750
to summarize those criminal personalities

623
00:38:04,910 --> 00:38:05,870
and patterns of human nature.

624
00:38:06,550 --> 00:38:07,470
I believe

625
00:38:07,910 --> 00:38:09,400
as long as I can predict

626
00:38:09,430 --> 00:38:10,990
more potential crimes,

627
00:38:11,830 --> 00:38:12,990
I can prevent more

628
00:38:13,030 --> 00:38:14,030
tragedies from happening.

629
00:38:18,860 --> 00:38:20,190
The evil seed

630
00:38:20,230 --> 00:38:21,390
you just saw,

631
00:38:22,710 --> 00:38:24,220
if it could be deleted with one click,

632
00:38:25,710 --> 00:38:27,110
there would be no more source of evil.

633
00:38:32,030 --> 00:38:32,710
I'm willing

634
00:38:35,050 --> 00:38:36,620
to take a step forward

635
00:38:37,030 --> 00:38:38,110
to break the boundaries.

636
00:39:12,830 --> 00:39:14,130
Don't stop me!

637
00:39:14,470 --> 00:39:15,730
I want to see Su Youliang.

638
00:39:15,760 --> 00:39:16,470
I know they brought him

639
00:39:16,510 --> 00:39:17,110
here to you.

640
00:39:17,110 --> 00:39:17,750
Ma'am.

641
00:39:18,670 --> 00:39:19,590
-Ma'am. Ma'am.
-Ma'am, you can’t go in.

642
00:39:19,590 --> 00:39:20,190
Don't stop me!

643
00:39:20,190 --> 00:39:21,470
Please calm down. Take it easy.

644
00:39:21,470 --> 00:39:22,230
Let's respect the deceased.

645
00:39:22,350 --> 00:39:23,030
Please don't get agitated.

646
00:39:23,070 --> 00:39:24,310
I'm his fiancée.

647
00:39:24,790 --> 00:39:25,870
I dare you to cremate him.

648
00:39:26,430 --> 00:39:26,950
Youliang was

649
00:39:26,990 --> 00:39:28,390
killed by that old woman!

650
00:39:28,750 --> 00:39:29,630
Where is he?

651
00:39:29,870 --> 00:39:30,670
I need to see him.

652
00:39:31,390 --> 00:39:31,830
Ma'am.

653
00:39:31,850 --> 00:39:32,470
But this

654
00:39:32,470 --> 00:39:33,590
won't solve the problem.

655
00:39:33,710 --> 00:39:34,350
I need to see him.

656
00:39:35,230 --> 00:39:35,550
This...

657
00:39:37,030 --> 00:39:37,510
Ma'am.

658
00:39:37,550 --> 00:39:38,990
This... This is really not appropriate. You...

659
00:40:29,950 --> 00:40:30,950
Youliang.

660
00:40:32,110 --> 00:40:32,910
Did it hurt?

661
00:40:49,870 --> 00:40:51,090
The East Suburb Funeral Home reported

662
00:40:51,220 --> 00:40:52,760
that a body of

663
00:40:52,760 --> 00:40:54,030
a young male was brought in today.

664
00:40:54,470 --> 00:40:55,590
Then a woman claiming to be

665
00:40:55,630 --> 00:40:57,280
the deceased's fiancée came out

666
00:40:57,280 --> 00:40:58,050
to prevent the cremation,

667
00:40:58,310 --> 00:40:59,750
saying the death was unnatural.

668
00:41:10,310 --> 00:41:11,110
The nails are clean,

669
00:41:11,190 --> 00:41:11,910
no foreign objects.

670
00:41:35,710 --> 00:41:36,990
My Youliang was so young,

671
00:41:37,230 --> 00:41:38,430
and he'd always been in good health.

672
00:41:38,550 --> 00:41:39,990
It's absolutely impossible that he died from illness.

673
00:41:40,350 --> 00:41:41,810
All the paperwork is complete.

674
00:41:42,030 --> 00:41:43,710
The hospital has issued a death certificate,

675
00:41:43,790 --> 00:41:45,410
and the family has signed off on it.

676
00:41:45,550 --> 00:41:46,310
Trust me.

677
00:41:46,340 --> 00:41:47,330
Investigate thoroughly.

678
00:41:47,790 --> 00:41:48,510
Let me tell you,

679
00:41:48,590 --> 00:41:49,230
you don't know

680
00:41:49,270 --> 00:41:50,670
how perverted that old woman is.

681
00:41:51,290 --> 00:41:51,470

She claims to be

She claims to be

698
00:42:01,990 --> 00:42:03,110
Su Youliang's fiancée.
(Su Youliang) (Lin Xiaoyin)

699
00:42:03,630 --> 00:42:04,110
What's the cause

700
00:42:04,110 --> 00:42:04,990
of Su Youliang's death?

701
00:42:05,390 --> 00:42:07,370
(Su Youliang) (Lin Xiaoyin)

702
00:42:07,370 --> 00:42:08,520
Sexual sudden death.
(Su Youliang) (Lin Xiaoyin)

703
00:42:08,950 --> 00:42:10,110
According to the Emergency Center,

704
00:42:10,390 --> 00:42:11,740
when they arrived at the scene,

705
00:42:11,850 --> 00:42:13,590
Su Youliang was already not breathing.

706
00:42:13,630 --> 00:42:15,290
He was lying naked on the couch.

707
00:42:15,360 --> 00:42:15,770
At the scene,

708
00:42:15,770 --> 00:42:15,950
(Beijiang Criminal Investigation Team)
At the scene,

709
00:42:15,950 --> 00:42:17,390
a large amount of aphrodisiacs were found.

(Beijiang Criminal Investigation Team)

713
00:42:18,910 --> 00:42:20,430
the deceased had engaged in multiple intense sexual activities.
(Beijiang Criminal Investigation Team)

714
00:42:21,030 --> 00:42:22,270
Therefore, they deduced

715
00:42:22,320 --> 00:42:23,180
that the cause of Su Youliang's death

716
00:42:23,230 --> 00:42:24,670
was acute myocardial infarction

717
00:42:24,710 --> 00:42:26,030
leading to sexual sudden death.

718
00:42:28,180 --> 00:42:28,370
Who is that An Luran?

719
00:42:28,370 --> 00:42:29,250
(An Luran)
Who is that An Luran?

00:42:29,250 --> 00:42:29,390
(An Luran)

721
00:42:29,390 --> 00:42:30,910
She is Su Youliang's girlfriend.
(An Luran)

722
00:42:31,190 --> 00:42:31,870
It's verified that

723
00:42:31,910 --> 00:42:32,630
the Emergency Center

724
00:42:32,630 --> 00:42:33,710
received a call from An Luran

725
00:42:33,830 --> 00:42:35,030
at five o'clock yesterday morning,

726
00:42:35,230 --> 00:42:35,300
saying her boyfriend was in critical condition.

(Su Youliang) (Lin Xiaoyin)
saying her boyfriend was in critical condition.

(Su Youliang) (Lin Xiaoyin)

729
00:42:37,790 --> 00:42:39,510
What's the deal with this Su Youliang?

730
00:42:39,870 --> 00:42:41,140
Lin Xiaoyin says

731
00:42:41,310 --> 00:42:43,350
she's Su Youliang's fiancée,

732
00:42:43,460 --> 00:42:45,860
while An Luran claims to be his girlfriend.

733
00:42:46,890 --> 00:42:48,480
Why did Lin Xiaoyin prevent the cremation?

(Su Youliang) (Lin Xiaoyin)

735
00:42:49,030 --> 00:42:50,110
She believes Su Youliang's death
(Su Youliang) (Lin Xiaoyin)

736
00:42:50,110 --> 00:42:50,990
was unnatural.

She suspects An Luran

740
00:42:52,110 --> 00:42:53,030
of causing Su Youliang's death.

741
00:42:54,150 --> 00:42:55,390
The autopsy results are in.

742
00:42:55,510 --> 00:42:57,310
The cause of death is acute myocardial infarction.

743
00:42:57,710 --> 00:42:58,430
It's a natural death.

744
00:43:00,740 --> 00:43:01,390
(Beijiang Criminal Investigation Team)

(Beijiang Criminal Investigation Team)

749
00:43:03,290 --> 00:43:04,350
But I found something

750
00:43:04,460 --> 00:43:05,210
in his body.

751
00:43:12,710 --> 00:43:13,390
Thallium?

752
00:43:15,430 --> 00:43:16,790
During the autopsy,

753
00:43:16,830 --> 00:43:17,990
I found that although the cause of death

754
00:43:17,990 --> 00:43:19,590
was acute myocardial infarction,

755
00:43:19,710 --> 00:43:21,430
his bodily functions were severely compromised.

756
00:43:21,630 --> 00:43:22,510
All of his organs

757
00:43:22,510 --> 00:43:23,550
were in a state of severe failure.

758
00:43:24,310 --> 00:43:25,910
I also checked his medical history.

759
00:43:25,910 --> 00:43:27,100
There were no underlying health issues.

760
00:43:27,510 --> 00:43:28,270
So I conducted

761
00:43:28,270 --> 00:43:29,350
further toxicology tests.

762
00:43:31,470 --> 00:43:32,400
Where was it detected?

763
00:43:33,110 --> 00:43:33,750
In his hair.

764
00:43:34,710 --> 00:43:37,030
Although thallium poisoning can be fatal,

765
00:43:37,190 --> 00:43:38,390
the amount in Su Youliang's body

766
00:43:38,390 --> 00:43:39,230
was very small.

767
00:43:39,830 --> 00:43:41,830
It's estimated that the poisoning occurred

768
00:43:41,830 --> 00:43:42,670
only about half a year ago.

769
00:43:43,270 --> 00:43:44,280
At this dosage,

770
00:43:44,390 --> 00:43:45,430
it wouldn't directly cause death.

771
00:43:45,870 --> 00:43:47,390
So I suspect that Su Youliang's

772
00:43:47,410 --> 00:43:48,490
actual cause of death

773
00:43:48,780 --> 00:43:50,870
was acute myocardial infarction

774
00:43:50,910 --> 00:43:52,220
triggered by taking aphrodisiacs

775
00:43:52,250 --> 00:43:53,910
and engaging in intense sexual activity

776
00:43:54,360 --> 00:43:55,470
while suffering from

777
00:43:55,470 --> 00:43:56,510
thallium poisoning.

778
00:43:58,480 --> 00:44:00,880
So this has turned into a poisoning case.

779
00:44:02,110 --> 00:44:04,700
But thallium is a

780
00:44:04,720 --> 00:44:05,600
chemical substance under state control.

781
00:44:06,020 --> 00:44:07,390
It's difficult to obtain

782
00:44:07,410 --> 00:44:09,110
unless through specific

783
00:44:09,190 --> 00:44:10,670
official channels.

784
00:44:13,380 --> 00:44:14,470
Don't forget.

785
00:44:14,790 --> 00:44:15,110
Su Youliang was a graduate student

786
00:44:15,110 --> 00:44:16,550
(Su Youliang)
Su Youliang was a graduate student

787
00:44:16,550 --> 00:44:16,570
(Su Youliang)

788
00:44:16,570 --> 00:44:17,690
of School of Pharmacy at the University of Chinese Medicine.
(Su Youliang)

789
00:44:18,140 --> 00:44:18,980
He might have had access

790
00:44:19,030 --> 00:44:20,480
to thallium in the laboratory.

791
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:27,770
(An Luran)

792
00:44:28,430 --> 00:44:29,460
Where is An Luran?

793
00:44:30,010 --> 00:44:30,830
She's gone abroad.

794
00:44:31,670 --> 00:44:32,600
Gone abroad?

795
00:44:32,830 --> 00:44:33,310
Yes.

796
00:44:33,330 --> 00:44:35,060
She's the chairwoman

797
00:44:35,090 --> 00:44:35,890
of Hua'an Medical Center.

798
00:44:35,930 --> 00:44:37,330
She left on a business trip after filing the report.

799
00:44:38,560 --> 00:44:39,600
When is she coming back?

800
00:44:39,750 --> 00:44:40,790
Her flight is tomorrow.

801
00:44:40,910 --> 00:44:42,020
I've already notified

802
00:44:42,020 --> 00:44:44,070
the airport police station to assist.

803
00:44:50,060 --> 00:44:50,680
Jiang Feng.

804
00:44:51,250 --> 00:44:52,880
Go investigate Su Youliang's

805
00:44:52,900 --> 00:44:53,960
living situation

806
00:44:54,270 --> 00:44:54,920
and look into

807
00:44:54,920 --> 00:44:55,800
his personal relationships.

808
00:44:56,110 --> 00:44:56,250
Got it.

809
00:44:56,250 --> 00:44:56,710
(Su Youliang)
Got it.

810
00:44:56,710 --> 00:44:58,470
(Su Youliang)

811
00:44:58,470 --> 00:44:59,060
Shen Yi.
(Su Youliang)

812
00:45:02,680 --> 00:45:03,890
Shen Yi!

813
00:45:07,750 --> 00:45:08,710
Come with me tomorrow to meet with

814
00:45:08,710 --> 00:45:09,790
Lin Xiaoyin and An Luran.

815
00:45:10,500 --> 00:45:11,060
Okay.
