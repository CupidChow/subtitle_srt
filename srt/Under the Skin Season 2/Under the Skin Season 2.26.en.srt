5
00:01:55,990 --> 00:01:57,570
Did you kill Tang Keying?

6
00:01:58,509 --> 00:01:59,390
Tang Keying?

7
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:02,330
She's dead?

8
00:02:04,940 --> 00:02:05,880
How did she die?

9
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:15,080
A needle was found at the scene.

10
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:16,470
On it,

11
00:02:16,470 --> 00:02:18,170
we found Tang Keying's tissue

12
00:02:19,050 --> 00:02:20,260
and some residue.

22
00:02:30,020 --> 00:02:31,640
You think I killed her?

23
00:02:32,740 --> 00:02:33,970
She was my student.

24
00:02:34,550 --> 00:02:36,530
On the night Tang Keying was killed,

25
00:02:36,990 --> 00:02:38,030
you two had met,

26
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:39,990
and then you returned to your studio,

27
00:02:40,030 --> 00:02:40,590
right?

28
00:02:41,100 --> 00:02:41,630
Yes.

29
00:02:42,350 --> 00:02:44,390
Then you left the studio.

30
00:02:44,670 --> 00:02:46,110
Where were you for over two hours?

31
00:02:47,590 --> 00:02:48,390
I went to the beach.

32
00:02:49,460 --> 00:02:50,340
Why did you go to the beach?

33
00:02:52,270 --> 00:02:53,700
Shen Yi taught me to paint the starry sky,

34
00:02:54,550 --> 00:02:55,790
but I couldn't no matter how I tried.

35
00:02:57,290 --> 00:02:58,630
So I thought I'd go to the beach

36
00:02:58,670 --> 00:02:59,790
to look at the real starry sky

37
00:03:00,830 --> 00:03:01,830
for some inspiration.

38
00:03:03,620 --> 00:03:04,390
Inspiration?

39
00:03:07,980 --> 00:03:09,150
What a coincidence.

40
00:03:10,030 --> 00:03:11,710
You went to the beach for inspiration,

41
00:03:13,030 --> 00:03:14,940
and Tang Keying's crime scene

42
00:03:15,190 --> 00:03:16,150
was also at the beach.

43
00:03:17,070 --> 00:03:18,030
I really don't know anything.

44
00:03:19,829 --> 00:03:20,960
Tang Keying's death...

45
00:03:23,110 --> 00:03:24,329
has really shocked me

46
00:03:25,470 --> 00:03:26,190
and upset me.

47
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:29,910
Someone's accusing you

48
00:03:31,350 --> 00:03:32,430
of killing Tang Keying.

49
00:03:33,590 --> 00:03:34,120
Who?

50
00:03:34,790 --> 00:03:35,590
Wu Bin.

51
00:03:49,590 --> 00:03:50,870
Nothing to say in your defense?

52
00:03:51,870 --> 00:03:52,350
No.

53
00:03:53,790 --> 00:03:54,940
What's your relationship with Wu Bin?

54
00:03:57,310 --> 00:03:58,010
Originally,

55
00:03:58,950 --> 00:04:00,110
it was an employment relationship.

56
00:04:02,550 --> 00:04:03,160
My research

57
00:04:03,190 --> 00:04:04,590
once cured his illness.

58
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:06,680
He always wanted to repay me.

59
00:04:08,510 --> 00:04:09,390
I felt sorry for him,

60
00:04:10,490 --> 00:04:11,270
so I recommended him

61
00:04:11,310 --> 00:04:12,630
to work as a driver for An Luran.

62
00:04:13,660 --> 00:04:14,300
I admit...

63
00:04:16,550 --> 00:04:17,589
I actually wanted him to

64
00:04:17,589 --> 00:04:18,709
help me monitor An Luran.

65
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:22,230
After all, I don't trust

66
00:04:22,550 --> 00:04:23,750
An Luran fully.

67
00:04:25,090 --> 00:04:26,830
That's why you regularly sent him money?

68
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:27,950
Yes.

69
00:04:31,510 --> 00:04:32,460
But now...

70
00:04:34,890 --> 00:04:36,020
we're like

71
00:04:36,260 --> 00:04:37,830
a farmer and a snake.

72
00:04:39,630 --> 00:04:41,190
The farmer kindly saved the snake,

73
00:04:42,030 --> 00:04:43,030
but in the end,

74
00:04:44,990 --> 00:04:47,150
the snake actually bit the farmer.

75
00:04:48,870 --> 00:04:49,600
I'm sorry,

76
00:04:50,350 --> 00:04:51,310
but could you clarify that?

77
00:04:54,260 --> 00:04:55,600
I've always believed

78
00:04:56,350 --> 00:04:57,710
that humans are born evil,

79
00:04:59,870 --> 00:05:01,050
but I've always hoped

80
00:05:01,970 --> 00:05:03,730
to see the good side of humans.

81
00:05:05,730 --> 00:05:06,900
But reality proved

82
00:05:08,390 --> 00:05:09,650
that the some people's evil

83
00:05:11,020 --> 00:05:12,340
is truly irreversible.

84
00:05:13,950 --> 00:05:15,270
You should've found out

85
00:05:16,790 --> 00:05:17,740
that in the past six months,

86
00:05:18,570 --> 00:05:20,180
Wu Bin has become increasingly greedy.

87
00:05:21,990 --> 00:05:23,110
He kept asking for more and more

88
00:05:23,110 --> 00:05:23,870
money from me.

89
00:05:25,180 --> 00:05:26,510
He even threatened me...

90
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:29,280
saying that if I don't pay him,

91
00:05:30,310 --> 00:05:31,310
he'd go to An Luran

92
00:05:31,350 --> 00:05:32,030
and expose me.

93
00:05:33,170 --> 00:05:34,250
But I still refused,

94
00:05:35,830 --> 00:05:36,710
because I know

95
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:38,980
that human desire...

96
00:05:41,510 --> 00:05:42,590
is a bottomless pit.

97
00:05:51,430 --> 00:05:52,430
So you believe

98
00:05:53,490 --> 00:05:55,250
that Wu Bin falsely accused you

99
00:05:56,860 --> 00:05:57,820
because you refused him?

100
00:05:59,590 --> 00:06:00,120
Yes,

101
00:06:01,660 --> 00:06:03,200
this is utter nonsense.

102
00:06:14,830 --> 00:06:15,470
Do you have

103
00:06:15,510 --> 00:06:16,310
any other evidence?

104
00:06:27,150 --> 00:06:27,870

00:10:01,750 --> 00:10:02,260
Wu Bin.

191
00:10:03,910 --> 00:10:05,660
An Luran's car surveillance

192
00:10:06,270 --> 00:10:07,590
is stored in the cloud.

193
00:10:09,010 --> 00:10:10,730
Our technical team is restoring it.

194
00:10:12,040 --> 00:10:12,920
So, soon,

195
00:10:13,830 --> 00:10:15,310
we'll know what happened

196
00:10:15,330 --> 00:10:16,410
that night.

197
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:20,180
I hope you'll tell the truth,

198
00:10:22,570 --> 00:10:24,200
which is a voluntary surrender,

199
00:10:25,930 --> 00:10:26,790
where we can apply

200
00:10:26,810 --> 00:10:28,060
to the court for leniency

201
00:10:28,330 --> 00:10:29,700
to get you a reduced sentence.

202
00:10:45,740 --> 00:10:47,020
I-I'll talk.

203
00:10:49,700 --> 00:10:50,950
I'll talk, I'll talk.

204
00:11:04,590 --> 00:11:06,360
The one who killed Tang Keying was...

205
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:10,080
An Luran.

206
00:11:15,630 --> 00:11:16,820
Originally, Ms. An...

207
00:11:19,160 --> 00:11:20,060
An Luran

208
00:11:21,150 --> 00:11:22,510
and Tang Keying agreed

209
00:11:22,550 --> 00:11:23,940
to go abroad together.

210
00:11:25,860 --> 00:11:26,550
But Tang Keying

211
00:11:26,550 --> 00:11:28,060
seemed to be emotionally unstable.

212
00:11:28,430 --> 00:11:29,550
She suddenly proposed

213
00:11:29,590 --> 00:11:30,830
to meet in person.

214
00:11:32,790 --> 00:11:33,460
So,

215
00:11:34,550 --> 00:11:36,330
we drove to the shipyard.

216
00:11:38,220 --> 00:11:38,850
Ms. An.

217
00:11:42,170 --> 00:11:43,640
I'll go in to see her alone.

218
00:11:43,870 --> 00:11:44,980
Don't go too far.

219
00:11:45,150 --> 00:11:46,340
Wait for me outside the shipyard.

220
00:11:47,380 --> 00:11:48,210
Okay, Ms. An.

221
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:02,130
What do you mean you're not coming with me?

222
00:12:02,410 --> 00:12:03,440
Two hours ago,

223
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:04,470
we agreed on the phone.

224
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:05,720
Why are you changing your mind again?

225
00:12:06,110 --> 00:12:07,320
I've changed my mind.

226
00:12:08,020 --> 00:12:08,830
Whether I follow

227
00:12:08,830 --> 00:12:09,750
you or Fang Kaiyi,

228
00:12:09,790 --> 00:12:11,030
it won't end well for me either way.

229
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:12,660
I've decided to leave you two

230
00:12:12,710 --> 00:12:13,910
and live my own life.

231
00:12:16,310 --> 00:12:17,500
You ungrateful brat.

232
00:12:17,960 --> 00:12:19,060
Ten million.

233
00:12:20,760 --> 00:12:21,830
Transfer it to me now.

234
00:12:24,150 --> 00:12:25,000
What do you mean?

235
00:12:25,710 --> 00:12:27,010
Pay me and I'll leave,

236
00:12:27,580 --> 00:12:29,120
or we'll both go down.

237
00:12:30,700 --> 00:12:31,960
The police said I was

238
00:12:32,190 --> 00:12:33,230
acting under your instigation,

239
00:12:33,270 --> 00:12:34,630
so I can redeem myself.

240
00:12:39,140 --> 00:12:40,200
Threatening me, huh?

241
00:12:49,130 --> 00:12:49,790
Fine.

242
00:12:50,540 --> 00:12:51,860
I understand your choice,

243
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:54,050
but you've to come with me first.

244
00:12:54,140 --> 00:12:55,870
Once we've landed abroad,

245
00:12:55,900 --> 00:12:56,750
I'll pay you.

246
00:12:57,550 --> 00:12:58,460
Then you won't have to

247
00:12:58,490 --> 00:12:59,730
live in fear in the country

248
00:12:59,840 --> 00:13:01,130
and can fully get rid of me.

249
00:13:01,150 --> 00:13:02,000
Win-win.

250
00:13:02,350 --> 00:13:03,690
You still think I'm a fool?

251
00:13:05,390 --> 00:13:07,070
You'll pay me once we're abroad?

252
00:13:07,530 --> 00:13:08,830
I'd probably have to be grateful

253
00:13:08,870 --> 00:13:10,070
just to keep my life.

254
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:11,300
Then why should I trust you?

255
00:13:11,330 --> 00:13:12,490
You have to trust me!

256
00:13:15,070 --> 00:13:16,610
I have the police's contact info.

257
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:18,190
I can have you arrested anytime!

258
00:13:18,390 --> 00:13:19,150
Have you gone insane?

259
00:13:19,190 --> 00:13:20,400
You all forced me into this!

260
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:23,290
Ms. An.

261
00:13:23,510 --> 00:13:25,120
I just want the money.

262
00:13:25,150 --> 00:13:25,750
Pay me,

263
00:13:25,750 --> 00:13:26,870
and I'll leave Beijiang immediately.

264
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:34,850
No, I can't trust you.

265
00:13:35,210 --> 00:13:36,340
I can give you the money,

266
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:37,510
but

267
00:13:37,780 --> 00:13:38,990
only after I've boarded

268
00:13:38,990 --> 00:13:39,510
the plane.

269
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:40,190
No!

270
00:13:41,070 --> 00:13:41,950
It has to be now,

271
00:13:41,950 --> 00:13:42,870
immediately!

272
00:13:43,270 --> 00:13:44,610
I can't wait even for a day.

273
00:13:44,670 --> 00:13:45,310
How do I know

274
00:13:45,310 --> 00:13:46,630
what tricks you'll use against me?

275
00:13:46,660 --> 00:13:47,270
Tang Keying.

276
00:13:47,310 --> 00:13:48,430
Don't push your luck!

277
00:13:48,490 --> 00:13:50,100
You have no right to yell at me anymore!

278
00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:51,140
Who's the most

279
00:13:51,190 --> 00:13:52,220
afraid of the police now?

280
00:13:52,760 --> 00:13:54,290
I'll call the police right now.

281
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:55,870
What are you doing?

282
00:13:55,900 --> 00:13:57,320
Calling the police, what else?

283
00:13:57,350 --> 00:13:58,430
You've really gone insane.

284
00:13:58,450 --> 00:13:59,240
Let go of me!

285
00:13:59,270 --> 00:14:00,430
Wu Bin! Wu Bin!

286
00:14:00,470 --> 00:14:01,170
Let go of me!

287
00:14:01,190 --> 00:14:02,190
-Wu Bin!
-Let go of me!

288
00:14:03,550 --> 00:14:04,230
What's wrong, Ms. An?

289
00:14:04,380 --> 00:14:05,500
Tie her up for me!

290
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:07,030
What are you going to do?

291
00:14:07,030 --> 00:14:07,630
Let go!

292
00:14:07,660 --> 00:14:08,550
Tang Keying, listen up,

293
00:14:08,590 --> 00:14:09,150
regardless,

294
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:10,520
you're leaving with me today!

295
00:14:10,670 --> 00:14:11,230
Are you going to

296
00:14:11,230 --> 00:14:12,110
kill me to silence me?

297
00:14:12,150 --> 00:14:12,590
Let's go!

298
00:14:14,350 --> 00:14:15,060
Move!

299
00:14:22,190 --> 00:14:22,850
Come back!

300
00:14:23,130 --> 00:14:23,870
Come back!

301
00:14:25,090 --> 00:14:25,760
Let go!

302
00:14:25,930 --> 00:14:26,840
You're not going anywhere!

303
00:14:26,860 --> 00:14:27,990
Let me go!

304
00:14:28,310 --> 00:14:28,970
Let me go!

305
00:14:32,310 --> 00:14:34,000
Ms. An! Ms. An!

306
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:34,750
She's holding

307
00:14:34,790 --> 00:14:36,160
an animal euthanasia syringe!

308
00:15:04,740 --> 00:15:06,390
Let go! Let go!

309
00:15:06,910 --> 00:15:08,530
I said let go!

310
00:16:00,990 --> 00:16:03,320
So you initially framed Fang Kaiyi

311
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,500
under An Luran's instructions too?

312
00:16:07,430 --> 00:16:07,990
Yes.

313
00:16:10,540 --> 00:16:11,890
After she calmed down,

314
00:16:13,150 --> 00:16:14,310
An Luran told me

315
00:16:15,590 --> 00:16:16,670
that she'd pay

316
00:16:16,670 --> 00:16:18,390
hush money to my family every year

317
00:16:18,430 --> 00:16:19,510
until she died.

318
00:16:21,630 --> 00:16:22,800
She also told me

319
00:16:23,810 --> 00:16:24,500
that I was just

320
00:16:24,500 --> 00:16:26,030
helping to dispose of the body.

321
00:16:26,050 --> 00:16:27,460
I'd get a few years in prison at most.

322
00:16:27,870 --> 00:16:29,000
She promised me

323
00:16:30,170 --> 00:16:31,520
that as long as I was alive,

324
00:16:32,180 --> 00:16:33,820
I'd always have leverage over her,

325
00:16:35,270 --> 00:16:37,000
and she'd keep her promise.

326
00:16:40,790 --> 00:16:42,170
One is your lifesaver,

327
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:45,630
and the other is your sponsor.

328
00:16:49,070 --> 00:16:50,390
Who are you really loyal to?

329
00:17:00,910 --> 00:17:02,650
Life's not just about being alive.

330
00:17:04,089 --> 00:17:06,040
I still have to worry about living.

331
00:17:08,520 --> 00:17:09,270
I have to

332
00:17:09,270 --> 00:17:10,470
receive treatment for a lifetime.

333
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:14,380
Since childhood, for my treatment,

334
00:17:16,339 --> 00:17:17,270
my family has already

335
00:17:17,270 --> 00:17:18,150
sacrificed too much.

336
00:17:18,170 --> 00:17:19,790
They have a ton of debt from compound-interest loans.

337
00:17:21,880 --> 00:17:22,960
I had no choice.

338
00:17:25,109 --> 00:17:25,750
Then why

339
00:17:25,750 --> 00:17:26,750
did you call Fang Kaiyi?

340
00:17:28,109 --> 00:17:29,270
An Luran said

341
00:17:30,300 --> 00:17:32,100
Fang Kaiyi was the most suspicious,

342
00:17:32,130 --> 00:17:33,480
with the most obvious motive.

343
00:17:35,180 --> 00:17:36,530
Framing him was the rational choice.

344
00:17:38,390 --> 00:17:39,030
Too bad...

345
00:17:41,470 --> 00:17:42,310
he didn't take the bait.

346
00:17:46,380 --> 00:17:47,070
I've already

347
00:17:47,110 --> 00:17:47,830
told you everything

348
00:17:47,830 --> 00:17:48,870
I know.

349
00:17:50,150 --> 00:17:51,710
If you don't believe me, investigate it.

350
00:17:54,210 --> 00:17:57,890
(Beijiang Branch
Beijiang City Public Security Bureau)

351
00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:05,210
We're from the Beijiang Criminal Investigation Team.

352
00:18:05,990 --> 00:18:07,110
Could you please check

353
00:18:07,190 --> 00:18:08,400
if there's a guest named An Luran?

354
00:18:16,350 --> 00:18:16,940
Captain Cheng.

355
00:18:17,870 --> 00:18:18,750
The car's memory card

356
00:18:18,750 --> 00:18:19,590
has been recovered.

357
00:18:20,770 --> 00:18:22,020
There's a recording

358
00:18:22,110 --> 00:18:23,630
of An Luran instructing Wu Bin

359
00:18:23,650 --> 00:18:24,550
to clean up the scene

360
00:18:24,590 --> 00:18:25,830
and dispose of the body.

361
00:18:30,890 --> 00:18:31,660
From his

362
00:18:31,660 --> 00:18:32,950
living environment and accessories,

363
00:18:33,010 --> 00:18:33,830
I've extracted a few

364
00:18:33,830 --> 00:18:34,590
rather conspicuous

365
00:18:34,610 --> 00:18:35,880
and aesthetically consistent elements.

366
00:18:41,020 --> 00:18:42,070
What do they tell us?

367
00:18:42,120 --> 00:18:43,900
That these symbols of belief

368
00:18:44,510 --> 00:18:45,630
are his way of seeking

369
00:18:45,670 --> 00:18:46,520
a sense of belonging.

370
00:18:47,510 --> 00:18:48,790
It might've stemmed from

371
00:18:48,830 --> 00:18:50,190
his congenital defects

372
00:18:50,710 --> 00:18:51,550
that he admires strength.

373
00:18:54,700 --> 00:18:55,320
Look.

374
00:18:56,570 --> 00:18:57,740
The figurine of Guan Gong

375
00:18:58,100 --> 00:18:58,990
is placed at his bedside,

376
00:18:59,800 --> 00:19:00,390
which is

377
00:19:00,390 --> 00:19:01,390
a very important position.

378
00:19:03,150 --> 00:19:04,780
Also, during his trial,

379
00:19:05,030 --> 00:19:06,150
when faced with crucial questions,

380
00:19:06,190 --> 00:19:08,020
he'd spread his arms and clench his fists sideways,

381
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:09,550
just like the statue of Guan Gong

382
00:19:09,590 --> 00:19:10,430
holding a sword,

383
00:19:10,970 --> 00:19:11,670
displaying

384
00:19:11,670 --> 00:19:12,790
a notable tense posture.

385
00:19:13,570 --> 00:19:15,150
Guan Gong's loyalty and righteousness

386
00:19:15,190 --> 00:19:16,930
might be the values he cherishes.

387
00:19:17,070 --> 00:19:18,360
And his loyalty,

388
00:19:18,580 --> 00:19:19,950
just like Guan Gong himself,

389
00:19:21,580 --> 00:19:22,750
is directed towards men.

390
00:19:24,390 --> 00:19:25,770
It's a kind of bottom-up

391
00:19:25,830 --> 00:19:26,990
reverence and worship.

392
00:19:32,270 --> 00:19:33,090
So,

393
00:19:33,590 --> 00:19:35,510
based on just a Guan Gong statue,

394
00:19:35,940 --> 00:19:37,110
you deduced that

395
00:19:37,150 --> 00:19:38,150
Wu Bin's loyalty

396
00:19:39,340 --> 00:19:40,410
doesn't lie with An Luran?

397
00:19:42,120 --> 00:19:43,410
It's Fang Kaiyi.

398
00:19:47,130 --> 00:19:48,950
But what I don't get is

399
00:19:49,880 --> 00:19:51,030
why he initially insisted

400
00:19:51,030 --> 00:19:52,070
on framing Fang Kaiyi.

401
00:19:56,980 --> 00:19:57,710
Don't think anymore.

402
00:19:59,090 --> 00:20:00,270
Once we catch An Luran,

403
00:20:00,710 --> 00:20:01,740
everything will be clear.

404
00:20:06,190 --> 00:20:07,570
Room 801 is right ahead.

405
00:20:22,670 --> 00:20:23,590
Who are you?

406
00:20:23,830 --> 00:20:24,660
An Luran.

407
00:20:32,520 --> 00:20:33,710
What are you doing?

408
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:36,080
Where did An Luran go?

409
00:20:36,350 --> 00:20:37,460
Ms. An went out.

410
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:38,730
How long has she been gone?

411
00:20:44,190 --> 00:20:45,770
Is this An Luran's phone?

412
00:20:49,780 --> 00:20:51,250
An Luran's phone is turned off.

413
00:20:52,050 --> 00:20:53,020
An Luran has fled.

414
00:20:53,080 --> 00:20:53,950
Notify everyone.

415
00:20:53,970 --> 00:20:54,750
Search the entire clubhouse.

416
00:20:54,790 --> 00:20:55,360
-Yes!
-Yes!

417
00:21:03,350 --> 00:21:04,510
We were one step behind.

418
00:21:04,820 --> 00:21:06,220
By the time Jiang Feng got there,

419
00:21:06,590 --> 00:21:07,650
she'd already left the country.

420
00:21:12,350 --> 00:21:13,550
What should we do next?

421
00:21:17,550 --> 00:21:18,240
Du Cheng.

422
00:21:20,420 --> 00:21:21,670
Fang Kaiyi's starry sky painting

423
00:21:21,670 --> 00:21:22,310
is strange.

424
00:21:23,570 --> 00:21:24,540
In one painting,

425
00:21:24,820 --> 00:21:25,630
there are two

426
00:21:25,670 --> 00:21:27,190
completely different emotions and styles.

427
00:21:29,060 --> 00:21:30,150
I suspect that it was

428
00:21:30,270 --> 00:21:31,150
after he returned

429
00:21:31,190 --> 00:21:32,070
from the beach

430
00:21:32,090 --> 00:21:33,070
that his brushstrokes

431
00:21:33,110 --> 00:21:34,850
began to change drastically.

432
00:21:35,860 --> 00:21:37,000
This is too unusual.

433
00:21:47,710 --> 00:21:48,550
Why is that?

434
00:21:58,980 --> 00:22:00,140
We've determined

435
00:22:00,500 --> 00:22:01,510
that Hua'an Medical Center

436
00:22:01,540 --> 00:22:03,810
is suspected of illegal organ transplantation and contraband smuggling.

437
00:22:04,020 --> 00:22:05,110
Through investigations of

438
00:22:05,150 --> 00:22:06,310
the involved companies and personnel,

439
00:22:06,510 --> 00:22:07,260
we've also discovered

440
00:22:07,260 --> 00:22:08,690
illegal assisted reproductive services.

441
00:22:09,390 --> 00:22:12,180
But the company's head, An Luran,

442
00:22:12,230 --> 00:22:13,270
has already fled.

443
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:14,790
How can we keep investigating?

444
00:22:17,110 --> 00:22:18,030
It's all my fault.

445
00:22:18,630 --> 00:22:19,660
I arrived too late.

446
00:22:20,790 --> 00:22:21,700
It's not your fault.

447
00:22:22,130 --> 00:22:23,390
She used a nanny to impersonate herself,

448
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:25,240
which means she was prepared long ago.

449
00:22:26,390 --> 00:22:27,230
You mean...

450
00:22:32,360 --> 00:22:33,320
We were tricked.

451
00:22:38,230 --> 00:22:39,680
What should we do next?

452
00:22:47,790 --> 00:22:48,920
Although An Luran has fled,

453
00:22:49,990 --> 00:22:51,440
we can't let go of the Hua'an lead.

454
00:22:51,970 --> 00:22:52,670
Next,

455
00:22:53,160 --> 00:22:54,310
we've to thoroughly investigate

456
00:22:54,350 --> 00:22:55,430
all of Hua'an's profit chains.

457
00:22:56,970 --> 00:22:57,510
I believe

458
00:22:57,530 --> 00:22:58,910
An Luran left in a hurry

459
00:22:59,070 --> 00:22:59,580
and couldn't have

460
00:22:59,580 --> 00:23:00,510
hidden everything well.

461
00:23:01,260 --> 00:23:02,270
-Yes.
-Yes.

462
00:23:04,390 --> 00:23:05,340
Where's Mr. Shen?

463
00:23:05,830 --> 00:23:07,180
Why didn't he come to the meeting?

464
00:23:07,790 --> 00:23:08,720
I don't know.

465
00:23:38,840 --> 00:23:40,160
Du Cheng, look.

466
00:23:42,150 --> 00:23:42,670
I've reconstructed

467
00:23:42,670 --> 00:23:43,630
Fang Kaiyi's starry sky painting.

468
00:23:44,300 --> 00:23:45,690
From the brushstrokes,

469
00:23:45,990 --> 00:23:46,990
I can strongly sense that

470
00:23:47,030 --> 00:23:47,750
those two hours

471
00:23:47,750 --> 00:23:49,270
must've been some special experience

472
00:23:49,330 --> 00:23:50,020
that caused

473
00:23:50,020 --> 00:23:51,190
a huge mood shift.

474
00:23:51,890 --> 00:23:53,830
He might've seen someone

475
00:23:54,440 --> 00:23:55,270
or something

476
00:23:55,270 --> 00:23:56,190
that disturbed him.

477
00:23:56,680 --> 00:23:57,350
In any case,

478
00:23:57,390 --> 00:23:58,350
things aren't that simple.

(Beijiang City Public Security Bureau Civil Petition)
(Approval Form for Police Leave Request)

480
00:24:04,750 --> 00:24:05,750
I've applied with Director Zhang

00:24:05,750 --> 00:24:06,590
(Beijiang City Public Security Bureau Civil Petition)
(Approval Form for Police Leave Request)

482
00:24:06,590 --> 00:24:07,710
for two weeks' leave for you.
(Beijiang City Public Security Bureau Civil Petition)
(Approval Form for Police Leave Request)

483
00:24:07,710 --> 00:24:09,090
(Beijiang City Public Security Bureau Civil Petition)
(Approval Form for Police Leave Request)

484
00:24:10,450 --> 00:24:11,740
You can get some fresh air

485
00:24:13,060 --> 00:24:14,040
and recalibrate.

486
00:24:17,350 --> 00:24:18,260
Why?

487
00:24:19,720 --> 00:24:20,710
Now's the most

488
00:24:20,710 --> 00:24:21,790
critical moment of this case.

489
00:24:21,950 --> 00:24:23,180
What leave?

490
00:24:23,550 --> 00:24:24,510
Give me more time,

491
00:24:24,550 --> 00:24:24,990
and I'll

492
00:24:25,030 --> 00:24:25,950
figure it all out.

493
00:24:25,970 --> 00:24:26,530
No need.

494
00:24:31,150 --> 00:24:32,640
You're off the case.

495
00:24:39,640 --> 00:24:40,750
What do you mean?

496
00:24:46,690 --> 00:24:47,550
Ever since you started

497
00:24:47,550 --> 00:24:48,780
the Human Nature Atlas research,

498
00:24:50,920 --> 00:24:51,990
you've become less and less

499
00:24:51,990 --> 00:24:53,070
like who you used to be.

500
00:24:54,770 --> 00:24:55,740
I understand

501
00:24:56,790 --> 00:24:58,010
that you want to predict crimes.

502
00:24:58,040 --> 00:24:58,710
Du Cheng.

503
00:25:00,410 --> 00:25:02,780
I'm about to figure out the truth.

504
00:25:06,820 --> 00:25:07,680
The truth is...

505
00:25:10,670 --> 00:25:12,010
we were tricked.

506
00:25:12,760 --> 00:25:14,020
From beginning to end,

507
00:25:14,550 --> 00:25:15,470
it was all

508
00:25:15,490 --> 00:25:16,830
a trap set by An Luran.

509
00:25:17,750 --> 00:25:18,790
Wu Bin was just a decoy

510
00:25:18,820 --> 00:25:20,070
An Luran provided us.

511
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:21,750
He first said

512
00:25:21,790 --> 00:25:22,990
he killed Tang Keying,

513
00:25:24,210 --> 00:25:25,620
then he framed Fang Kaiyi,

514
00:25:26,440 --> 00:25:28,270
and then finally said it was An Luran.

515
00:25:28,930 --> 00:25:30,030
All of this was to

516
00:25:30,030 --> 00:25:31,750
buy time for An Luran to escape.

517
00:25:37,880 --> 00:25:38,650
Impossible.

518
00:25:39,420 --> 00:25:40,950
Wu Bin couldn't have done this for An Luran

519
00:25:40,990 --> 00:25:41,880
because

520
00:25:42,110 --> 00:25:43,110
the person he's loyal to

521
00:25:43,110 --> 00:25:43,990
is Fang Kaiyi!

522
00:25:45,590 --> 00:25:47,440
Du Cheng, believe me.

523
00:25:47,490 --> 00:25:48,430
You have to believe me, I—

524
00:25:48,460 --> 00:25:49,930
When have I not trusted you?

525
00:25:53,650 --> 00:25:54,960
Whenever you had an inspiration,

526
00:25:56,540 --> 00:25:58,490
when did I not investigate it thoroughly?

527
00:26:01,260 --> 00:26:02,390
As bizarre as

528
00:26:02,430 --> 00:26:03,550
they were,

529
00:26:03,970 --> 00:26:04,720
I always chose to

530
00:26:04,750 --> 00:26:06,110
believe you unconditionally.

531
00:26:09,630 --> 00:26:10,630
I hope to

532
00:26:10,670 --> 00:26:12,200
protect my colleagues well.

533
00:26:15,030 --> 00:26:15,720
But despite

534
00:26:15,790 --> 00:26:16,990
my endless persuasion,

535
00:26:19,630 --> 00:26:21,070
you remained indifferent,

536
00:26:21,950 --> 00:26:23,110
only sinking deeper and deeper.

537
00:26:24,570 --> 00:26:25,380
Shen Yi.

538
00:26:26,450 --> 00:26:27,790
Have you ever thought about

539
00:26:29,350 --> 00:26:30,030
how your intuition

540
00:26:30,070 --> 00:26:31,470
might be right 99 times,

541
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:35,510
but even if it's wrong once...

542
00:26:39,410 --> 00:26:40,650
that I can't bear it?

543
00:27:19,740 --> 00:27:20,570
(Alarm)

544
00:27:20,570 --> 00:27:21,370
Where's Shen Yi?
(Alarm)

545
00:27:21,370 --> 00:27:26,110
(Alarm)

546
00:27:26,110 --> 00:27:26,830
Where's Shen Yi?
(Alarm)

547
00:27:26,830 --> 00:27:27,610
(Alarm)

548
00:27:54,400 --> 00:27:55,920
(Police)

549
00:28:13,670 --> 00:28:14,270
Captain Cheng.

550
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:16,640
Interpol has started

551
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:17,590
searching for

552
00:28:17,630 --> 00:28:18,990
An Luran's movement trajectory.

553
00:28:20,330 --> 00:28:21,150
Have they located her

554
00:28:21,190 --> 00:28:21,790
exact position?

555
00:28:22,590 --> 00:28:23,280
Not yet.

556
00:28:25,510 --> 00:28:26,990
But I've synchronized our info

557
00:28:27,010 --> 00:28:28,460
with the city's criminal investigation team

558
00:28:28,940 --> 00:28:30,110
and found a previous

559
00:28:30,150 --> 00:28:30,990
customs smuggling case

560
00:28:31,030 --> 00:28:32,190
they uncovered.

561
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:36,690
It was mentioned that eight months ago,

562
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:37,930
Hua'an Medical Center

563
00:28:37,950 --> 00:28:40,050
applied for biological product export

564
00:28:40,080 --> 00:28:42,130
under the guise of transporting canine blood plasma.

565
00:28:42,540 --> 00:28:44,410
We suspect these biological products

566
00:28:44,430 --> 00:28:45,760
are likely to be embryos.

567
00:28:46,630 --> 00:28:48,020
And most importantly,

568
00:28:48,460 --> 00:28:50,660
the person accompanying the export was Tang Keying.

569
00:28:55,020 --> 00:28:56,360
Although Tang Keying

570
00:28:56,390 --> 00:28:57,710
was Hua'an's liaison,

571
00:29:00,830 --> 00:29:02,350
why did she need to accompany

572
00:29:02,390 --> 00:29:03,230
the export?

573
00:29:06,070 --> 00:29:09,130
Could it be that Tang Keying was secretly

574
00:29:09,150 --> 00:29:10,070
helping An Luran

575
00:29:10,100 --> 00:29:11,520
with other things?

576
00:29:15,820 --> 00:29:16,850
That's possible.

577
00:29:17,960 --> 00:29:19,030
Go check on Kailai Biotechnology's

578
00:29:19,070 --> 00:29:20,150
embryo experiments.

579
00:29:20,940 --> 00:29:21,510
Okay.

580
00:30:02,140 --> 00:30:03,440
It's been a while since we met.

581
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:06,350
How is it?

582
00:30:07,860 --> 00:30:09,240
Have you caught An Luran?

583
00:30:11,490 --> 00:30:12,670
Do you have anything to do...

584
00:30:15,330 --> 00:30:16,720
with Tang Keying's death?

585
00:30:19,260 --> 00:30:20,810
You still suspect me?

586
00:30:22,440 --> 00:30:24,070
Last time you took me to the police station,

587
00:30:25,290 --> 00:30:26,190
didn't I explain

588
00:30:26,190 --> 00:30:27,190
everything clearly?

589
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:29,070
My intuition

590
00:30:29,070 --> 00:30:30,230
keeps telling me

591
00:30:33,230 --> 00:30:34,430
that your painting's off.

592
00:30:36,900 --> 00:30:37,850
The emotions

593
00:30:39,030 --> 00:30:40,930
and styles before and after

594
00:30:41,630 --> 00:30:42,590
are totally different.

595
00:30:44,430 --> 00:30:45,470
If it accurately

596
00:30:45,470 --> 00:30:46,720
reflects your inner state,

597
00:30:50,470 --> 00:30:51,390
then tell me

598
00:30:53,070 --> 00:30:54,150
what happened

599
00:30:55,110 --> 00:30:56,590
in those two hours that

600
00:30:56,590 --> 00:30:58,230
caused such a huge mood shift?

601
00:30:59,970 --> 00:31:01,430
So you still think

602
00:31:01,430 --> 00:31:02,710
I killed her?

603
00:31:04,750 --> 00:31:05,870
In those two hours,

604
00:31:06,990 --> 00:31:08,460
you think I went to kill someone, right?

605
00:31:10,470 --> 00:31:11,260
Shen Yi.

606
00:31:14,280 --> 00:31:15,800
What kind of person do you think I am?

607
00:31:16,180 --> 00:31:17,550
I see you as a friend,

608
00:31:19,760 --> 00:31:20,810
a very important friend.

609
00:31:24,030 --> 00:31:25,310
So please tell me,

610
00:31:26,830 --> 00:31:27,660
is this matter...

611
00:31:29,960 --> 00:31:31,910
related to you or not?

612
00:31:41,830 --> 00:31:42,580
Over these years,

613
00:31:45,010 --> 00:31:46,640
to continue my research,

614
00:31:51,270 --> 00:31:52,190
I did have to

615
00:31:52,190 --> 00:31:53,430
rely on Maoyu Group

616
00:31:54,230 --> 00:31:55,190
and associate with people

617
00:31:55,230 --> 00:31:55,870
like An Luran.

618
00:31:57,830 --> 00:31:58,470
I don't know

619
00:31:58,470 --> 00:31:59,950
what the Group and An Luran have done.

620
00:32:02,030 --> 00:32:02,660
What I pursue

621
00:32:02,710 --> 00:32:03,830
isn't profit at all.

622
00:32:06,350 --> 00:32:08,450
Why'd I break the law?

623
00:32:12,820 --> 00:32:14,350
I can tell you for a fact

624
00:32:17,070 --> 00:32:18,390
that Tang Keying's death...

625
00:32:20,850 --> 00:32:23,020
has nothing to do with me at all.

626
00:32:31,430 --> 00:32:32,150
Shen Yi.

627
00:32:35,660 --> 00:32:37,810
I showed you the starry sky in my heart,

628
00:32:40,840 --> 00:32:41,520
but you...

629
00:32:45,030 --> 00:32:46,910
insist on finding dark clouds in it.

630
00:32:50,310 --> 00:32:51,310
Could it be possible

631
00:32:51,350 --> 00:32:52,160
that...

632
00:32:55,350 --> 00:32:56,780
you're so paranoid

633
00:32:58,370 --> 00:32:59,880
because of your profession?

634
00:33:02,510 --> 00:33:04,670
It's interfering with your true feelings.

635
00:33:10,030 --> 00:33:11,390
Have you ever thought about

636
00:33:13,410 --> 00:33:14,110
how your intuition

637
00:33:14,130 --> 00:33:15,650
might be right 99 times,

638
00:33:18,100 --> 00:33:19,590
but even if it's wrong once...

639
00:33:23,520 --> 00:33:24,520
that I can't bear it?

640
00:33:32,580 --> 00:33:34,050
I'm choosing to trust you.

641
00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:41,750
But I also ask that

642
00:33:41,790 --> 00:33:43,210
you live up to this trust.

643
00:33:49,070 --> 00:33:49,740
Thank you.

(Beijiang Criminal Investigation)

645
00:34:34,320 --> 00:34:35,760
I'm increasingly realizing

646
00:34:36,389 --> 00:34:38,300
that even in the microscopic world,

647
00:34:38,590 --> 00:34:41,190
structure determines function.

648
00:34:41,920 --> 00:34:42,989
Gene mutations

649
00:34:43,030 --> 00:34:44,580
affect protein structure,

650
00:34:45,210 --> 00:34:46,989
and changes in protein structure

651
00:34:47,429 --> 00:34:47,989
also alter

652
00:34:48,030 --> 00:34:48,870
cellular functions.

653
00:34:50,520 --> 00:34:51,320
Your eyes

654
00:34:51,320 --> 00:34:52,620
have become as powerful as instruments,

655
00:34:53,469 --> 00:34:54,630
able to deduce gene mutations

656
00:34:54,670 --> 00:34:56,429
through the shape and structure

657
00:34:56,710 --> 00:34:58,200
of cells and proteins.

658
00:34:59,660 --> 00:35:01,530
If I can improve your efficiency,

659
00:35:01,670 --> 00:35:02,910
can you start the editing experiment

660
00:35:02,940 --> 00:35:04,110
on MAOA gene mutation

661
00:35:04,110 --> 00:35:04,870
sooner?

662
00:35:08,220 --> 00:35:09,330
The experiment isn't difficult,

663
00:35:10,620 --> 00:35:11,390
but what comes after?

664
00:35:11,900 --> 00:35:12,590
If we can't

665
00:35:12,630 --> 00:35:14,470
intervene at the fertilized egg stage,

666
00:35:15,010 --> 00:35:15,830
it won't produce

667
00:35:15,870 --> 00:35:17,590

00:35:22,270 --> 00:35:23,570
may remain illegal

671

in our lifetime.

Mr. Cao is here.

Mr. Cao?

675
00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:41,870
You go ahead.

676
00:35:41,890 --> 00:35:42,700
I'll wait for you there.

677
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:43,330
Okay.

678
00:35:53,680 --> 00:35:54,560
Come, be careful.

00:35:56,300 --> 00:35:57,280
Mr. Cao.

680
00:35:57,820 --> 00:35:59,040
You're so early.

681
00:35:59,380 --> 00:36:00,740
We happened to be nearby,

682
00:36:01,310 --> 00:36:02,110
so we came over.

683
00:36:03,390 --> 00:36:05,020
I'll only be at ease after you

684
00:36:05,050 --> 00:36:06,140
examine her.

685
00:36:06,230 --> 00:36:06,850
No problem.

686
00:36:07,740 --> 00:36:08,300
By the way,

687
00:36:08,780 --> 00:36:10,350
I need to discuss the funding issue

688
00:36:10,370 --> 00:36:12,220
for my research institute's operation.

689
00:36:13,190 --> 00:36:13,770
Okay.

690
00:36:14,740 --> 00:36:16,840
Why don't you find a place to rest for a bit?

691
00:36:17,310 --> 00:36:18,150
I'll take a stroll.

692
00:36:18,180 --> 00:36:18,590
Okay.

693
00:36:18,620 --> 00:36:18,950
Go ahead.

694
00:36:20,470 --> 00:36:21,100
This way.

695
00:36:29,420 --> 00:36:30,310
Officer Shen.

696
00:36:30,580 --> 00:36:31,390
Ms. Zhou.

697
00:36:31,580 --> 00:36:32,460
Long time no see.

698
00:36:33,370 --> 00:36:33,890
Have a seat.

699
00:36:43,720 --> 00:36:44,440
How far along are you?

700
00:36:44,880 --> 00:36:45,910
Almost eight months.

701
00:36:47,620 --> 00:36:49,000
What brings you here today?

702
00:36:49,530 --> 00:36:51,610
We're here for the baby's genetic testing.

703
00:36:52,270 --> 00:36:53,400
We basically

704
00:36:53,450 --> 00:36:54,480
come every month.

705
00:36:55,940 --> 00:36:56,550
How is it?

706
00:36:56,620 --> 00:36:57,460
Is everything okay?

707
00:36:58,480 --> 00:36:59,290
It's great.

708
00:37:00,070 --> 00:37:02,390
Cao says this baby of mine

709
00:37:02,550 --> 00:37:03,440
is exceptional

710
00:37:03,880 --> 00:37:04,810
and very strong.

711
00:37:05,070 --> 00:37:06,840
It's bound to be extraordinary.

712
00:37:07,870 --> 00:37:08,980
Cao hopes

713
00:37:09,190 --> 00:37:10,550
it'll inherit

714
00:37:10,590 --> 00:37:11,500
the family business.

715
00:37:12,090 --> 00:37:14,710
As for me, I just hope

716
00:37:15,040 --> 00:37:15,930
it'll be happy.

717
00:37:21,760 --> 00:37:23,890
So, you and Cao Jian...

718
00:37:27,380 --> 00:37:28,230
We got married.

719
00:37:29,820 --> 00:37:31,680
I'm his legal wife now.

720
00:37:35,710 --> 00:37:36,860
Surprised, aren't you?

721
00:37:37,070 --> 00:37:37,660
No.

722
00:37:38,580 --> 00:37:39,960
As long as you're happy.

723
00:37:42,420 --> 00:37:44,090
I guess my basic needs are covered

724
00:37:44,110 --> 00:37:45,750
for the rest of my life.

725
00:37:46,010 --> 00:37:47,110
I don't have

726
00:37:48,190 --> 00:37:49,680
other extravagant hopes.

727
00:37:51,800 --> 00:37:52,540

00:37:52,640 --> 00:37:53,430
Mrs. Cao,

729
00:37:53,500 --> 00:37:54,430
everything's ready.

730
00:37:54,450 --> 00:37:55,250
Please come with me.

731
00:37:55,280 --> 00:37:55,950
Okay.

732
00:37:57,110 --> 00:37:57,430
Careful.

733
00:37:57,450 --> 00:37:57,850
Careful.

734
00:38:05,350 --> 00:38:07,290
Goodbye, Officer Shen.

735
00:38:08,980 --> 00:38:09,830
Goodbye.

736
00:38:22,740 --> 00:38:23,670
Recently,

737
00:38:24,710 --> 00:38:26,360
I've been feeling the baby's movements.

738
00:38:26,810 --> 00:38:27,910
This child is

739
00:38:28,710 --> 00:38:30,030
free from bad genes.

740
00:38:30,710 --> 00:38:32,880
It's bound to be extraordinary.

741
00:38:36,670 --> 00:38:38,110
Then I think,

742
00:38:38,750 --> 00:38:39,960
after this child is born,

743
00:38:39,990 --> 00:38:40,870
I'll personally

744
00:38:41,140 --> 00:38:42,090
raise it

745
00:38:42,140 --> 00:38:43,940
to inherit my business.

746
00:38:44,030 --> 00:38:45,140
Thinking of all this

747
00:38:46,710 --> 00:38:48,140
makes me feel so hopeful.

748
00:38:48,600 --> 00:38:50,210
I could keep working for decades more.

749
00:38:52,110 --> 00:38:53,100
Mr. Fang.

751
00:39:05,040 --> 00:39:05,680
How are

752
00:39:06,250 --> 00:39:07,870
the baby and Shanshan?

753
00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:12,310
They're good, of course.

Keep a close eye

756
00:39:16,850 --> 00:39:17,540
and pay attention.

757
00:39:17,920 --> 00:39:20,030
Of course, I'll be careful.

758
00:39:22,240 --> 00:39:23,050
I should go.

759
00:39:23,290 --> 00:39:24,100
I won't stay long.

00:39:31,360 --> 00:39:32,560
Could you have imagined this before?

764
00:39:34,130 --> 00:39:34,720
I'm off.

765
00:39:41,300 --> 00:39:42,570
(DNA Sequencing Analysis Report)

766
00:40:15,180 --> 00:40:16,090
Mr. Fang.

767
00:40:16,120 --> 00:40:17,630
After correcting the data, this batch's mice

768
00:40:17,630 --> 00:40:18,470
in this experiment

769
00:40:18,490 --> 00:40:19,990
all experienced biochemical pregnancies.

770
00:40:21,090 --> 00:40:21,840
So?

771
00:40:23,900 --> 00:40:25,070
At what time point?

772
00:40:25,480 --> 00:40:26,400
What symptoms?

773
00:40:27,600 --> 00:40:28,720
Any similarities or differences?

774
00:40:29,150 --> 00:40:30,830
Where did the problem occur?

775
00:40:34,740 --> 00:40:35,990
Do I have to be present

776
00:40:36,010 --> 00:40:36,870
for everything

777
00:40:36,920 --> 00:40:38,150
for you to do your job?

778
00:40:39,700 --> 00:40:40,880
Do you think you just need

779
00:40:40,910 --> 00:40:41,800
to inform me

780
00:40:42,390 --> 00:40:43,340
that it failed again,

781
00:40:43,600 --> 00:40:45,410
that it was all in vain again, huh?

782
00:40:53,640 --> 00:40:54,390
Go.

783
00:41:00,550 --> 00:41:01,350
What's wrong?

784
00:41:02,910 --> 00:41:03,910
What happened?

785
00:41:04,730 --> 00:41:05,520
Nothing.

786
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:07,230
Just a normal

787
00:41:07,280 --> 00:41:07,990
experimental failure.

788
00:41:09,800 --> 00:41:10,590
Do you need me for anything?

789
00:41:12,150 --> 00:41:13,560
Zhou Shanshan said

790
00:41:14,070 --> 00:41:14,880
you've been conducting

791
00:41:14,880 --> 00:41:15,760
genetic tests on the child.

792
00:41:17,370 --> 00:41:18,700
Cao Jian's always worried.

793
00:41:20,300 --> 00:41:21,860
It's because of his genetic defect, right?

794
00:41:23,500 --> 00:41:25,130
Besides the violent gene mutation,

795
00:41:25,710 --> 00:41:26,590
there's also a genetic mutation

796
00:41:26,590 --> 00:41:27,270
affecting reproduction.

797
00:41:31,460 --> 00:41:32,620
What about that child?

798
00:41:32,940 --> 00:41:33,700
Is it hereditary?

799
00:41:34,260 --> 00:41:35,340
If possible,

800
00:41:35,360 --> 00:41:36,820
-can I see his genetic sequencing—
-Shen Yi.

801
00:41:39,250 --> 00:41:40,350
It's not worth it.

802
00:41:42,090 --> 00:41:43,750
It's just an imperfect offspring

803
00:41:43,770 --> 00:41:45,290
of an imperfect person.

804
00:41:47,140 --> 00:41:48,600
Don't waste any more time on this.

805
00:41:50,440 --> 00:41:51,270
I'm sorry,

806
00:41:51,550 --> 00:41:52,810
I need to go to the lab.
