(Under the Skin Ⅱ)

00:01:43,430 --> 00:01:46,070
(Episode 27)

3
00:01:52,860 --> 00:01:54,870
Destroying embryos is quite simple.

4
00:01:55,910 --> 00:01:57,750
Frozen embryos need to be preserved in

5
00:01:57,750 --> 00:02:00,100
liquid nitrogen at minus 196 degrees Celsius.

6
00:02:00,710 --> 00:02:01,710
The experimental embryos

7
00:02:01,710 --> 00:02:02,800
that need to be disposed of

8
00:02:02,870 --> 00:02:04,450
are left at room temperature

9
00:02:04,510 --> 00:02:05,510
after being taken out of storage.

10
00:02:05,540 --> 00:02:06,940
They become inactive within a few minutes.

11
00:02:07,550 --> 00:02:08,889
Then the storage manager collects them

12
00:02:08,990 --> 00:02:10,090
and disposes of the test tubes.

13
00:02:10,150 --> 00:02:11,009
The entire process

14
00:02:11,550 --> 00:02:12,270
is then over.

15
00:02:14,550 --> 00:02:15,650
How many people

16
00:02:15,870 --> 00:02:16,950
are involved in this process?

17
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:17,870
(Strict Regulation, Fairness and Justice, Procedural Legality, Objectivity and Impartiality)

18
00:02:17,870 --> 00:02:19,670
Usually, it's the lab tech and the storage manager
(Strict Regulation, Fairness and Justice, Procedural Legality, Objectivity and Impartiality)

19
00:02:19,670 --> 00:02:19,840
(Strict Regulation, Fairness and Justice, Procedural Legality, Objectivity and Impartiality)

20
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:20,900
working as a pair
(Strict Regulation, Fairness and Justice, Procedural Legality, Objectivity and Impartiality)

21
00:02:21,310 --> 00:02:22,070
to be each other's witnesses.

22
00:02:25,950 --> 00:02:26,550
Captain Cheng.

23
00:02:27,670 --> 00:02:29,200
A destruction record from eight months ago shows that

24
00:02:29,590 --> 00:02:30,590
one of the people

25
00:02:30,870 --> 00:02:31,810
who confirmed the destruction

26
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:32,850
was Tang Keying,

27
00:02:33,150 --> 00:02:34,310
and the other was…

28
00:02:39,829 --> 00:02:41,070
Do you know someone

29
00:02:41,430 --> 00:02:42,470
named Liu Lian?

30
00:02:48,500 --> 00:02:50,500
With so many items going in and out of storage every day,

31
00:02:50,900 --> 00:02:51,910
how could I possibly remember

32
00:02:51,930 --> 00:02:53,510
something from eight months ago?

33
00:02:54,780 --> 00:02:56,430
Do you remember the liquid nitrogen tank

34
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:57,800
Tang Keying borrowed?

35
00:03:00,060 --> 00:03:00,770
No.

36
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:02,310
You usually keep records

37
00:03:02,350 --> 00:03:03,670
and verify the number

38
00:03:03,860 --> 00:03:05,850
of experimental embryos destroyed,

39
00:03:06,390 --> 00:03:07,000
right?

40
00:03:07,590 --> 00:03:08,070
Yes.

41
00:03:08,470 --> 00:03:09,350
Then eight months ago,

42
00:03:09,390 --> 00:03:10,300
when you were verifying,

43
00:03:10,340 --> 00:03:11,260
did the numbers match?

44
00:03:13,330 --> 00:03:15,250
I guess they did.

45
00:03:15,690 --> 00:03:16,860
What do you mean you guess?

46
00:03:17,530 --> 00:03:18,290
Listen.

47
00:03:19,550 --> 00:03:21,230
Even though Tang Keying is dead,

48
00:03:21,430 --> 00:03:21,490
we'll still thoroughly investigate

49
00:03:21,490 --> 00:03:22,420
(Beijiang Criminal Investigation Team)
we'll still thoroughly investigate

50

51
00:03:22,470 --> 00:03:23,670
her illegal activities.

00:03:24,110 --> 00:03:25,230

55

and not beat around the bush.

(Beijiang Criminal Investigation Team)

57
00:03:28,900 --> 00:03:30,420
At that time,

58
00:03:32,270 --> 00:03:34,870
I-I think there was one missing.

59
00:03:35,750 --> 00:03:37,350
When I was verifying,

60
00:03:37,950 --> 00:03:39,470
I specifically mentioned it.

61
00:03:39,950 --> 00:03:42,920
Tang Keying said she had forgotten about it

62
00:03:43,230 --> 00:03:45,070
and would destroy it with the next batch,

63
00:03:45,110 --> 00:03:47,140
so I just let it be.

64
00:03:47,190 --> 00:03:48,110
She said she forgot about it,

65
00:03:49,060 --> 00:03:50,329
and you just let it slide?

66
00:03:53,710 --> 00:03:54,750
Officer,

67
00:03:55,190 --> 00:03:56,840
I just work there.

68
00:03:57,180 --> 00:03:58,740
Tang Keying took orders from the boss.

69
00:03:58,790 --> 00:04:00,190
Who am I to ask questions?

70
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:08,570
Has this kind of thing

71
00:04:09,830 --> 00:04:10,910
happened

72
00:04:11,140 --> 00:04:12,910
at Kailai Biotechnology

73
00:04:13,590 --> 00:04:14,310
before?

74
00:04:16,950 --> 00:04:18,230
Yeah, I guess.

75
00:04:18,310 --> 00:04:18,990
How many times?

76
00:04:22,110 --> 00:04:23,510
A few times.

77
00:04:23,530 --> 00:04:24,770
Be specific!

78
00:04:25,670 --> 00:04:26,210
I…

79
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:27,550
I really can't remember.

80
00:04:28,430 --> 00:04:30,030
It definitely wasn't the first time.

81
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:33,490
If experimental embryos were taken abroad,

82
00:04:34,510 --> 00:04:35,390
what would they be used for?

83
00:04:38,380 --> 00:04:39,320
Experiments

84
00:04:39,590 --> 00:04:40,310
or

85
00:04:41,190 --> 00:04:42,030
implantation into human bodies.

86
00:04:42,350 --> 00:04:43,380
Both are possible.

87
00:04:47,870 --> 00:04:49,110
Did Fang Kaiyi

88
00:04:50,230 --> 00:04:51,510
know about this matter?

89
00:04:53,430 --> 00:04:54,940
I don't know about that.

90
00:05:05,850 --> 00:05:07,170
I took a close look at it.

91
00:05:07,670 --> 00:05:09,290
Zhou Shanshan's baby

92
00:05:09,350 --> 00:05:10,030
indeed no longer has

93
00:05:10,030 --> 00:05:11,590
the MAOA gene mutation,

94
00:05:12,310 --> 00:05:13,230
which means

95
00:05:14,070 --> 00:05:15,300
Cao Jian is really going to have

96
00:05:15,300 --> 00:05:16,620
a child without genetic defects.

97
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:19,630
But I still have

98
00:05:19,670 --> 00:05:20,550
a strange feeling.

99
00:05:21,180 --> 00:05:22,270
In this overall heat map

100
00:05:22,310 --> 00:05:23,680
of sequencing expression,

101
00:05:24,790 --> 00:05:27,360
something feels dissonant.

102
00:05:31,070 --> 00:05:32,310
Although the bug no longer exists,

103
00:05:32,870 --> 00:05:33,670
it doesn't mean

104
00:05:33,710 --> 00:05:34,950
the genes are flawless.

105
00:05:36,230 --> 00:05:37,920
You've been conducting genetic tests

106
00:05:38,030 --> 00:05:40,240
on this baby since July this year.

107
00:05:40,950 --> 00:05:42,530
At that time, the baby was only

108
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:43,520
about three months old.

109
00:05:44,030 --> 00:05:45,150
It was all requested by Cao Jian.

110
00:05:46,830 --> 00:05:47,550
Then didn't you

111
00:05:47,570 --> 00:05:48,710
further investigate

112
00:05:48,740 --> 00:05:49,550
why this child

113
00:05:49,590 --> 00:05:50,310
didn't inherit

114
00:05:50,390 --> 00:05:51,470
Cao Jian's genetic defect?

115
00:05:56,030 --> 00:05:57,190
I can't see the baby.

116
00:05:58,420 --> 00:05:59,110
What I can see

117
00:05:59,110 --> 00:06:00,230
are just sets of codes.

118
00:06:01,190 --> 00:06:01,870
That child

119
00:06:01,870 --> 00:06:02,990
has its own genetic codes.

120
00:06:03,830 --> 00:06:04,820
Good or bad, they are what they are.

121
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:06,760
I still have many codes

122
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:08,120
that need to be studied and deciphered.

123
00:06:10,910 --> 00:06:11,790
For me,

124
00:06:12,490 --> 00:06:13,990
the present and the future

125
00:06:14,510 --> 00:06:15,590
matter the most.

126
00:06:34,750 --> 00:06:36,150
Captain Cheng, I've found it.

127
00:06:37,580 --> 00:06:38,470
All the experimental embryos

128
00:06:38,510 --> 00:06:39,870
of Kailai Biotechnology

129
00:06:39,870 --> 00:06:41,150
were provided

130
00:06:41,170 --> 00:06:41,810
by Hua'an Medical Center.

131
00:06:42,470 --> 00:06:43,470
Hua'an Medical Center?

132
00:06:44,180 --> 00:06:45,010
The one run by An Luran?

133
00:06:51,190 --> 00:06:52,110
Have you found the source

134
00:06:52,150 --> 00:06:53,430
of the embryo that An Luran took abroad?

135
00:06:54,150 --> 00:06:55,050
Yes.

136
00:06:55,350 --> 00:06:56,800
But you may be surprised

137
00:06:56,950 --> 00:06:58,190
by to whom it belongs.

138
00:06:58,430 --> 00:06:59,030
Who is it?

139
00:06:59,830 --> 00:07:01,390
Cao Jian, Zhou Shanshan.

140
00:07:04,710 --> 00:07:05,750
Zhou Shanshan underwent

141
00:07:05,750 --> 00:07:06,990
IVF at Hua'an.

142
00:07:07,230 --> 00:07:08,480
After the embryo was created,

143
00:07:08,510 --> 00:07:10,550
it was sent to Kailai Biotechnology

144
00:07:10,590 --> 00:07:12,110
in the name of experimental donation.

145
00:07:12,830 --> 00:07:14,600
Then Fang Kaiyi edited

146
00:07:14,630 --> 00:07:15,630
the genes of the embryo.

147
00:07:15,830 --> 00:07:17,680
That embryo was supposed to be destroyed,

148
00:07:17,750 --> 00:07:19,160
but Tang Keying stole it

149
00:07:19,270 --> 00:07:20,140
and took it abroad.

150
00:07:22,190 --> 00:07:23,670
Seven and a half months ago,

151
00:07:23,790 --> 00:07:25,750
Zhou Shanshan went abroad

152
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:27,140
for an embryo transfer.

153
00:07:27,190 --> 00:07:28,340
The hospital where the transfer was done

154
00:07:28,420 --> 00:07:29,590
was introduced by Hua'an.

155
00:07:36,909 --> 00:07:37,820
I see.

156
00:07:38,270 --> 00:07:40,000
Cao Jian has a genetic defect.

157
00:07:40,590 --> 00:07:42,130
He planned to have Zhou Shanshan

158
00:07:42,190 --> 00:07:43,240
give birth to a child

159
00:07:43,270 --> 00:07:44,720
whose genes had been edited.

160
00:07:45,570 --> 00:07:47,770
But this genetically edited embryo,

161
00:07:47,820 --> 00:07:48,810
according to regulations,

162
00:07:49,140 --> 00:07:50,230
should have been destroyed.

163
00:07:53,590 --> 00:07:55,170
It's getting more and more complicated.

164
00:07:56,090 --> 00:07:56,880
Not at all.

165
00:07:57,500 --> 00:07:59,270
The whole thing only involved three people.

166
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:01,940
Tang Keying is dead.

167
00:08:02,230 --> 00:08:03,470
An Luran has fled.

168
00:08:04,820 --> 00:08:05,870
And the last one is...

169
00:08:06,890 --> 00:08:07,720
Fang Kaiyi.

170
00:08:09,270 --> 00:08:09,710
Yes.

171
00:08:28,140 --> 00:08:29,110
Fang Kaiyi.

172
00:08:41,429 --> 00:08:42,110
We've discovered

173
00:08:42,130 --> 00:08:43,870
an illegal operation at Hua'an Medical Center

174
00:08:44,030 --> 00:08:45,100
that involved Kailai Biotechnology.

175
00:08:45,130 --> 00:08:46,070
Please come with us

176
00:08:46,070 --> 00:08:46,710
to assist with our investigation.

177
00:08:48,100 --> 00:08:48,950
(Summons)

178
00:08:48,950 --> 00:08:49,710
This is the summons.
(Summons)

179
00:08:49,710 --> 00:08:50,920
(Summons)

180
00:08:54,920 --> 00:08:55,700
Officer Du.

181
00:08:56,910 --> 00:08:58,320
Why do you suspect me

182
00:08:59,350 --> 00:09:00,910
in every one of your cases?

183
00:09:01,580 --> 00:09:02,820
Our investigation has revealed

184
00:09:03,110 --> 00:09:04,430
that in your laboratory,

185
00:09:04,540 --> 00:09:06,200
three embryos numbered

186
00:09:06,230 --> 00:09:07,800
3203, 3304,

187
00:09:07,830 --> 00:09:09,560
and 3725

188
00:09:09,780 --> 00:09:10,990
were not destroyed as required.

189
00:09:11,230 --> 00:09:12,920
They were taken out of the country

190
00:09:13,030 --> 00:09:13,820
by your assistant, Tang Keying.

191
00:09:14,830 --> 00:09:16,190
Tang Keying is already dead.

192
00:09:17,510 --> 00:09:18,710
Have you found the murderer?

193
00:09:20,750 --> 00:09:21,670
Are you aware of

194
00:09:21,710 --> 00:09:22,390
what I just said?

195
00:09:23,710 --> 00:09:24,310
Yes.

196
00:09:33,050 --> 00:09:34,990
I edited the genes…

197
00:09:36,700 --> 00:09:37,460
of Embryo 3304.

198
00:09:39,430 --> 00:09:40,830
Why didn't you report it to the police?

199
00:09:41,980 --> 00:09:42,700
Officer Du,

200
00:09:44,140 --> 00:09:45,160
we're scientists.

201
00:09:46,630 --> 00:09:47,950
In a sense,

202
00:09:48,790 --> 00:09:49,990
we're also adventurers.

203
00:09:50,870 --> 00:09:51,950
Based on current scientific ethics

204
00:09:51,950 --> 00:09:53,390
and laws, Tang Keying did

205
00:09:53,660 --> 00:09:55,590
do something wrong.

206
00:09:56,960 --> 00:09:58,050
But to be honest,

207
00:09:58,510 --> 00:10:00,070
I admire her courage.

208
00:10:01,310 --> 00:10:02,070
We have been conducting

209
00:10:02,110 --> 00:10:03,630
embryonic gene editing research.

210
00:10:05,630 --> 00:10:06,270
This research concerns

211
00:10:06,270 --> 00:10:07,910
the future of all humanity.

212
00:10:10,020 --> 00:10:11,630
But due to current scientific ethics,

213
00:10:13,070 --> 00:10:13,870
all experimental subjects

214
00:10:14,660 --> 00:10:15,710
can only grow for 14 days.

215
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:19,190
After 14 days, they must be destroyed.

216
00:10:21,590 --> 00:10:22,390
It's such a pity.

217
00:10:23,870 --> 00:10:25,030
We really wish

218
00:10:25,430 --> 00:10:26,590
our research subjects

219
00:10:26,630 --> 00:10:27,510
could be born

220
00:10:28,580 --> 00:10:29,910
and we could watch them grow up…

221
00:10:29,950 --> 00:10:30,550
Impossible!

222
00:10:32,390 --> 00:10:33,110
That's illegal.

223
00:10:37,790 --> 00:10:39,110
Of course I know it's illegal.

224
00:10:40,950 --> 00:10:42,350
That's why I criticized Tang Keying.

225
00:10:43,670 --> 00:10:44,670
And she promised me

226
00:10:44,770 --> 00:10:45,590
that she would never

227
00:10:45,590 --> 00:10:46,550
do such a thing again.

228
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:49,390
The embryo

229
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:50,980
that Tang Keying took abroad

230
00:10:51,260 --> 00:10:53,310
belonged to Cao Jian and Zhou Shanshan.

231
00:10:53,330 --> 00:10:55,170
After you edited its genes,

232
00:10:56,030 --> 00:10:57,550
it was implanted back into

233
00:10:57,550 --> 00:10:58,710
Zhou Shanshan. Do you know that?

234
00:10:59,770 --> 00:11:00,670
No.

235
00:11:02,180 --> 00:11:03,130
All I know is

236
00:11:03,750 --> 00:11:04,830
when Zhou Shanshan was

237
00:11:04,830 --> 00:11:05,750
three months pregnant,

238
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:07,930
Cao Jian brought her to me

239
00:11:08,710 --> 00:11:09,670
and asked me to do genetic tests

240
00:11:09,670 --> 00:11:10,510
for his child.

241
00:11:10,660 --> 00:11:11,350
A major incident

242
00:11:11,350 --> 00:11:12,230
happened in your institute,

243
00:11:12,270 --> 00:11:12,910
yet you're telling me

244
00:11:12,910 --> 00:11:13,910
you know nothing about it?

245
00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:26,870
Officer Du.

246
00:11:28,950 --> 00:11:29,950
I can't admit to something

247
00:11:29,980 --> 00:11:31,390
I know absolutely nothing about,

248
00:11:31,390 --> 00:11:31,910
can I?

249
00:11:33,700 --> 00:11:35,330
Are you pressing me like this

250
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:37,800
because you want to take me back

251
00:11:38,290 --> 00:11:39,750
and force a confession out of me?

252
00:11:41,540 --> 00:11:42,830
Or is it like last time,

253
00:11:43,030 --> 00:11:44,830
when you suspected me of murder

254
00:11:45,180 --> 00:11:47,120
based on just one person's statement?

255
00:12:02,150 --> 00:12:02,940
Officer Du.

256
00:12:03,750 --> 00:12:04,970
I completely understand you.

257
00:12:06,470 --> 00:12:08,350
The investigation isn't going well,

258
00:12:08,500 --> 00:12:09,430
so you're in a bad mood.

259
00:12:13,190 --> 00:12:13,950
I admit

260
00:12:14,850 --> 00:12:16,600
there was negligence

261
00:12:16,630 --> 00:12:17,790
in management on my part.

262
00:12:18,670 --> 00:12:19,510
But the whole thing

263
00:12:19,550 --> 00:12:20,950
was done by Tang Keying alone.

264
00:12:23,110 --> 00:12:23,630
Moreover,

265
00:12:26,070 --> 00:12:27,230
she's passed away.

266
00:12:31,430 --> 00:12:32,070
What's wrong?

267
00:12:33,150 --> 00:12:33,910
Nothing.

268
00:12:37,820 --> 00:12:38,590
Just a misunderstanding.

269
00:12:43,590 --> 00:12:44,300
Fang Kaiyi!

270
00:12:44,830 --> 00:12:45,570
Fang Kaiyi!

271
00:12:47,430 --> 00:12:48,120
He's gone.

272
00:12:48,550 --> 00:12:49,590
The child is gone.

273
00:12:50,590 --> 00:12:51,510
Mr. Cao, calm down.

274
00:12:51,510 --> 00:12:52,260
Take your time. What happened?

275
00:12:52,510 --> 00:12:53,190
Embryonic demise.

276
00:12:53,750 --> 00:12:55,160
The baby's heart suddenly stopped.

277
00:12:55,550 --> 00:12:56,590
It caused Shanshan

278
00:12:57,230 --> 00:12:59,910
to suffer placental abruption and severe bleeding.

279
00:12:59,950 --> 00:13:01,530
She died on the way to the hospital.

280
00:13:01,830 --> 00:13:02,950
How is that possible?

281
00:13:02,970 --> 00:13:04,000
How is that possible?

282
00:13:04,030 --> 00:13:05,630
You tell me!

283
00:13:05,660 --> 00:13:06,350
Mr. Cao.

284
00:13:06,370 --> 00:13:07,140
How is that possible?

285
00:13:07,140 --> 00:13:08,110
Mr. Cao, Mr. Cao.

286
00:13:08,130 --> 00:13:09,350
-You killed my son!
-Mr. Cao.

287
00:13:09,410 --> 00:13:10,580
You killed Shanshan!

288
00:13:10,620 --> 00:13:11,930
I'll make you pay!

289
00:13:12,030 --> 00:13:13,880
Didn't you say the baby was fine?

290
00:13:14,070 --> 00:13:15,560
Didn't you say he was doing well?

291
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:17,340
Thanks to your gene editing,

292
00:13:17,370 --> 00:13:18,830
both of them died!

293
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:20,000
I won't let this go!

294
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:20,450
(Jiangcheng Kailai Biotechnology)
I won't let this go!

295
00:13:20,450 --> 00:13:20,580
(Jiangcheng Kailai Biotechnology)

296
00:13:20,580 --> 00:13:21,470
I won't let this go!
(Jiangcheng Kailai Biotechnology)

297
00:13:21,470 --> 00:13:21,510
(Jiangcheng Kailai Biotechnology)

298
00:13:21,510 --> 00:13:21,980
Mr. Cao, please calm down.
(Jiangcheng Kailai Biotechnology)

299
00:13:21,980 --> 00:13:22,790
Mr. Cao, please calm down.

300
00:13:22,830 --> 00:13:23,980
What exactly happened?

301
00:13:25,620 --> 00:13:26,380
Du Cheng.

302
00:13:26,670 --> 00:13:28,460
Good. I need to file a report.

303
00:13:28,530 --> 00:13:29,200
He…

304
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:30,460
He killed my child.

305
00:13:30,840 --> 00:13:31,730
He killed Shanshan.

306
00:13:31,790 --> 00:13:33,510
Arrest him! Arrest him!

307
00:13:33,530 --> 00:13:34,300
Calm down.

308
00:13:34,330 --> 00:13:34,950
Go back with us

309
00:13:34,950 --> 00:13:35,910
to sort this out.

310
00:13:36,020 --> 00:13:36,590
Arrest him!

311
00:13:36,590 --> 00:13:37,630
Mr. Cao, Mr. Cao.

312
00:13:38,150 --> 00:13:39,200
It's really him!

313
00:13:40,260 --> 00:13:41,380
-Mr. Cao.
-Let go of me!

314
00:13:52,710 --> 00:13:53,510
Now, another person

315
00:13:53,550 --> 00:13:54,390
is accusing you of murder.

316
00:13:57,430 --> 00:13:59,130
There must be a misunderstanding.

317
00:14:01,830 --> 00:14:03,100
Please come with us

318
00:14:04,300 --> 00:14:05,800
to clear up

319
00:14:06,180 --> 00:14:07,300
all the misunderstandings.

320
00:14:11,590 --> 00:14:12,300
Alright.

321
00:14:35,430 --> 00:14:37,310
What happened to Zhou Shanshan

322
00:14:37,330 --> 00:14:38,610
and your unborn child?

323
00:14:41,030 --> 00:14:42,150
It's all my fault.

324
00:14:42,910 --> 00:14:44,470
I believed Tang Keying.

325
00:14:45,150 --> 00:14:46,190
She promised

326
00:14:46,470 --> 00:14:47,580
that if I found Fang Kaiyi

327
00:14:47,710 --> 00:14:49,330
and let him do gene editing on the embryo,

328
00:14:49,590 --> 00:14:50,310
my genetic disease

329
00:14:50,330 --> 00:14:51,630
wouldn't be passed on to my son.

330
00:14:52,430 --> 00:14:53,610
So Shanshan and I

331
00:14:54,150 --> 00:14:54,860
decided to donate

332
00:14:54,910 --> 00:14:55,910
our fertilized eggs.

333
00:14:56,250 --> 00:14:57,410
Then they arranged

334
00:14:57,590 --> 00:14:58,580
the gene editing

335
00:14:58,750 --> 00:14:59,910
and the follow-up procedures.

336
00:15:01,550 --> 00:15:02,230
They?

337
00:15:03,190 --> 00:15:04,230
Who do you mean?

338
00:15:04,830 --> 00:15:05,650
Tang Keying

339
00:15:05,990 --> 00:15:06,940
and An Luran.

340
00:15:07,830 --> 00:15:09,470
Zhou Shanshan had a natural miscarriage.

341
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:11,980
The cause of her death was placental abruption.

342
00:15:12,670 --> 00:15:13,830
They're normal.

343
00:15:14,230 --> 00:15:15,430
There's no evidence to prove

344
00:15:15,430 --> 00:15:16,400
that Fang Kaiyi had anything to do

345
00:15:16,430 --> 00:15:17,030
with their deaths.

346
00:15:17,630 --> 00:15:18,130
No.

347
00:15:18,270 --> 00:15:19,850
I was present for all the other steps.

348
00:15:20,030 --> 00:15:20,920
It was only the gene editing

349
00:15:20,950 --> 00:15:21,820
that I didn't witness.

350
00:15:22,070 --> 00:15:23,400
Something must have gone wrong

351
00:15:23,430 --> 00:15:24,230
during gene editing.

352
00:15:24,510 --> 00:15:25,790
He's a mad scientist.

353
00:15:26,070 --> 00:15:27,950
He experimented on my family!

354
00:15:29,710 --> 00:15:32,280
The steps you mentioned just now,

355
00:15:32,960 --> 00:15:34,110
how were they carried out specifically?

356
00:15:36,270 --> 00:15:38,410
An Luran arranged

357
00:15:38,680 --> 00:15:39,690
the IVF.

358
00:15:40,590 --> 00:15:41,680
Then Tang Keying

359
00:15:41,790 --> 00:15:43,550
transported the embryo abroad.

360
00:15:44,430 --> 00:15:45,300
After that, An Luran

361
00:15:45,370 --> 00:15:46,470
helped me contact a hospital

362
00:15:46,510 --> 00:15:47,130
for the surgery.

363
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:53,120
So you're saying

364
00:15:53,150 --> 00:15:54,270
throughout the entire process,

365
00:15:54,350 --> 00:15:55,080
you never

366
00:15:55,100 --> 00:15:56,230
met Fang Kaiyi?

367
00:15:57,720 --> 00:15:59,190
No, I didn't.

368
00:16:02,350 --> 00:16:03,440
Then why did you

369
00:16:03,470 --> 00:16:04,120
go to Fang Kaiyi

370
00:16:04,150 --> 00:16:05,200
when Zhou Shanshan was three months pregnant

371
00:16:05,230 --> 00:16:06,550
to have him

372
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:08,150
perform genetic tests

373
00:16:08,190 --> 00:16:09,070
on your child?

374
00:16:09,840 --> 00:16:11,550
Because he edited the genes.

375
00:16:11,950 --> 00:16:13,510
He knew about the whole thing.

376
00:16:14,030 --> 00:16:14,850
So I felt most at ease

377
00:16:15,110 --> 00:16:16,460
having him do the tests.

378
00:16:17,960 --> 00:16:19,250
During this process,

379
00:16:19,590 --> 00:16:21,370
did he mention to you

380
00:16:21,500 --> 00:16:22,270
whether he had encountered

381
00:16:22,270 --> 00:16:23,470
any problems

382
00:16:23,500 --> 00:16:24,420
when he edited the genes?

383
00:16:25,450 --> 00:16:26,150
No.

384
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:27,920
He always told me

385
00:16:27,970 --> 00:16:29,630
everything was fine, nothing to worry about.

386
00:16:30,440 --> 00:16:31,870
How could I have possibly imagined

387
00:16:31,870 --> 00:16:33,070
that something like this would happen?

388
00:16:33,090 --> 00:16:33,760
Right?

389
00:16:35,750 --> 00:16:36,580
Mr. Cao,

390
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,510
think hard.

391
00:16:39,390 --> 00:16:40,080
Is there any

392
00:16:40,100 --> 00:16:41,670
concrete evidence that can prove

393
00:16:41,700 --> 00:16:43,180
Fang Kaiyi is responsible

394
00:16:43,230 --> 00:16:44,630
for the deaths of Zhou Shanshan and your child?

395
00:16:48,730 --> 00:16:49,820
No.

396
00:16:50,180 --> 00:16:51,030
He never showed up

397
00:16:51,050 --> 00:16:52,640
throughout the entire process.

398
00:16:52,760 --> 00:16:53,780
But he must have been

399
00:16:53,830 --> 00:16:55,640
the mastermind behind this whole thing!

400
00:17:03,560 --> 00:17:04,589
Thank you for talking with us.

401
00:17:15,910 --> 00:17:17,300
Cao Jian insists

402
00:17:17,720 --> 00:17:19,920
that you caused the deaths of Zhou Shanshan and his child.

403
00:17:24,550 --> 00:17:25,750
I understand his feelings,

404
00:17:27,740 --> 00:17:29,600
but there are many reasons that could cause embryonic demise.

405
00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:32,350
The reasons for placental abruption are also complex.

406
00:17:33,550 --> 00:17:35,820
During the embryo implantation,

407
00:17:36,690 --> 00:17:38,470
whether there was medical malpractice,

408
00:17:38,510 --> 00:17:39,430
I'm not sure.

409
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:41,590
Mr. Cao is too emotional,

410
00:17:42,870 --> 00:17:44,970
so he's jumped to conclusions.

411
00:17:45,850 --> 00:17:47,220
I request

412
00:17:47,310 --> 00:17:48,190
a thorough investigation

413
00:17:49,470 --> 00:17:50,870
to give Mr. Cao justice

414
00:17:52,070 --> 00:17:53,240
and clear my name.

415
00:17:57,780 --> 00:17:59,070
The current gene editing technology

416
00:17:59,150 --> 00:18:00,260
is not mature.

417
00:18:02,790 --> 00:18:03,870
Is it possible that

418
00:18:05,750 --> 00:18:07,300
your editing

419
00:18:08,510 --> 00:18:10,400
caused the abnormality of the fetus,

420
00:18:10,430 --> 00:18:11,830
which led to its death?

421
00:18:14,440 --> 00:18:15,300
Officer Du,

422
00:18:17,550 --> 00:18:18,630
that's not the point.

423
00:18:24,750 --> 00:18:25,710
Gene editing

424
00:18:26,460 --> 00:18:27,030
is a part

425
00:18:27,070 --> 00:18:28,030
of my research.

426
00:18:29,070 --> 00:18:31,200
Even if something had gone wrong,

427
00:18:31,510 --> 00:18:33,660
the embryo should've been destroyed.

428
00:18:34,230 --> 00:18:35,670
The key point now is that

429
00:18:36,230 --> 00:18:38,210
the embryo, which was supposed to be destroyed,

430
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:40,020
was implanted into a human body.

431
00:18:42,380 --> 00:18:44,200
This is the true reason

432
00:18:44,230 --> 00:18:45,390
for the tragedy.

433
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,510
Implanting an edited human embryo

434
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:50,450
into a human body

435
00:18:51,230 --> 00:18:52,330
is an action

436
00:18:53,910 --> 00:18:55,820
that is absolutely not allowed.

437
00:19:16,630 --> 00:19:17,660
So this tragedy

438
00:19:18,550 --> 00:19:20,110
is also Tang Keying's fault.

439
00:19:24,460 --> 00:19:25,340
I'm at fault too.

440
00:19:26,850 --> 00:19:27,750
As the legal representative

441
00:19:27,790 --> 00:19:28,670
of the research institute,

442
00:19:29,950 --> 00:19:31,910
I neglected my responsibilities

443
00:19:33,070 --> 00:19:34,870
when I didn't hold

444
00:19:36,550 --> 00:19:38,380
my employee accountable

445
00:19:38,430 --> 00:19:39,550
after she stole the embryo

446
00:19:40,410 --> 00:19:41,530
and transported it abroad.

447
00:19:42,710 --> 00:19:44,110
I've learned my lesson.

448
00:19:53,240 --> 00:19:55,290
I used to think that besides research,

449
00:19:56,500 --> 00:19:57,380
you weren't capable of anything else.

450
00:19:59,990 --> 00:20:00,670
Alright.

451
00:20:02,950 --> 00:20:04,120
You can leave in a moment.

452
00:20:06,440 --> 00:20:08,140
I'm really sorry

453
00:20:09,990 --> 00:20:10,950
that this happened.

454
00:20:14,180 --> 00:20:15,540
I'm a victim too.

455
00:20:21,490 --> 00:20:22,780
Don't leave the country

456
00:20:23,060 --> 00:20:24,140
or Beijiang.

457
00:20:24,940 --> 00:20:26,340
Be ready to cooperate with the investigation at any time.

458
00:20:28,420 --> 00:20:29,060
Okay.

459
00:20:30,980 --> 00:20:32,510
I know Fang Kaiyi too well.

460
00:20:32,830 --> 00:20:34,200
Do you know how much money he needs

461
00:20:34,220 --> 00:20:34,930
to keep his institute running?

462
00:20:35,190 --> 00:20:36,430
He's done a lot of research.

463
00:20:36,550 --> 00:20:37,430
Plants, animals,

464
00:20:37,610 --> 00:20:38,800
human organs, and such.

465
00:20:38,830 --> 00:20:40,740
Even the slightest imperfection

466
00:20:40,750 --> 00:20:42,320
could make him want to destroy it all.

467
00:20:42,540 --> 00:20:43,270
My child

468
00:20:43,340 --> 00:20:44,650
was killed by him just like that!

469
00:20:45,240 --> 00:20:47,160
Why are you so certain

470
00:20:47,270 --> 00:20:48,190
that it was Fang Kaiyi's

471
00:20:48,220 --> 00:20:49,140
gene editing

472
00:20:49,460 --> 00:20:50,590
that caused the deaths

473
00:20:50,630 --> 00:20:51,780
of Zhou Shanshan and your child?

474
00:20:52,740 --> 00:20:54,040
If it wasn't the editing,

475
00:20:54,070 --> 00:20:55,070
what else could it be?

476
00:20:57,830 --> 00:20:58,910
I've seen that child's

477
00:20:58,930 --> 00:20:59,860
gene sequencing chart.

478
00:21:00,870 --> 00:21:01,950
There's no problem.

479
00:21:02,520 --> 00:21:03,240
Now,

480
00:21:03,970 --> 00:21:05,600
unless you have evidence to prove

481
00:21:05,630 --> 00:21:07,460
that Fang Kaiyi intentionally

482
00:21:07,490 --> 00:21:09,380
performed gene editing on the child

483
00:21:09,790 --> 00:21:10,720
and implanted it into

484
00:21:10,750 --> 00:21:11,870
Zhou Shanshan

485
00:21:11,990 --> 00:21:13,230
and that Fang Kaiyi

486
00:21:13,260 --> 00:21:14,110
had improper operations

487
00:21:14,150 --> 00:21:15,340
during the entire process

488
00:21:15,390 --> 00:21:16,910
that led to their deaths,

489
00:21:17,570 --> 00:21:19,660
your appeal

490
00:21:19,990 --> 00:21:21,070
might not even meet

491
00:21:21,070 --> 00:21:21,870
the conditions for filing a case.

492
00:21:25,190 --> 00:21:26,240
Take him to sign.

493
00:21:27,030 --> 00:21:28,030
Let's go, Mr. Cao.

494
00:21:56,630 --> 00:21:57,310
You can go now.

495
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:10,790
Let's go.

496
00:22:14,710 --> 00:22:15,480
Is this what you meant by

497
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:16,630
different paths leading to the same destination?

498
00:22:20,150 --> 00:22:21,430
If one day,

499
00:22:21,770 --> 00:22:22,900
your job

500
00:22:23,230 --> 00:22:25,030
and your passion didn't line up,

501
00:22:27,550 --> 00:22:28,480
how would you choose?

502
00:22:30,030 --> 00:22:30,780
I believe

503
00:22:31,710 --> 00:22:33,020
they are different paths to the same destination.

504
00:22:38,830 --> 00:22:39,790
Are you here

505
00:22:41,430 --> 00:22:43,150
as a friend of the suspect

506
00:22:44,680 --> 00:22:45,790
or as my colleague?

507
00:23:00,470 --> 00:23:01,470
The fact that you let him go

508
00:23:02,150 --> 00:23:03,110
shows that

509
00:23:03,160 --> 00:23:04,270
you have no evidence

510
00:23:04,760 --> 00:23:05,430
to prove

511
00:23:05,470 --> 00:23:06,830
my friend is a suspect.

512
00:23:08,040 --> 00:23:09,430
I let him go only because

513
00:23:09,470 --> 00:23:10,680
I haven't found the evidence

514
00:23:10,710 --> 00:23:12,070
to prove your friend committed a crime.

515
00:23:16,310 --> 00:23:17,230
If you have evidence,

516
00:23:18,620 --> 00:23:19,890
feel free to come to me again.

517
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:24,710
Shen Yi.

518
00:23:27,430 --> 00:23:28,230
The right path

519
00:23:28,270 --> 00:23:29,680
always leads to what's right.

520
00:23:30,390 --> 00:23:31,520
The wrong path

521
00:23:31,830 --> 00:23:32,680
will only lead you to make

522
00:23:32,710 --> 00:23:33,830
bigger mistakes.

523
00:23:34,710 --> 00:23:36,510
Different paths can't lead to the same destination.

524
00:23:38,530 --> 00:23:39,270
Sorry.

525
00:23:41,510 --> 00:23:42,390
I'm still on leave.

526
00:23:43,610 --> 00:23:45,360
Will you come back when your leave is over?

527
00:24:03,340 --> 00:24:04,440
I can no longer control

528
00:24:04,470 --> 00:24:05,800
the impulses brought by

529
00:24:05,830 --> 00:24:06,860
my subjective feelings and intuition.

530
00:24:12,300 --> 00:24:13,410
If my instincts

531
00:24:13,430 --> 00:24:14,110
make me no longer suitable

532
00:24:14,150 --> 00:24:15,430
for a profiler…

533
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:20,510
I'll let them guide me

534
00:24:23,610 --> 00:24:25,060
to do something more meaningful.

535
00:25:14,790 --> 00:25:15,490
Are you alright?

536
00:25:16,370 --> 00:25:17,040
Fang Kaiyi!

537
00:25:17,830 --> 00:25:18,620
You bastard!

538
00:25:18,650 --> 00:25:19,480
Stop right there!

539
00:25:20,200 --> 00:25:20,870
Mr. Cao.

540
00:25:22,150 --> 00:25:23,310
I'm very sorry

541
00:25:23,560 --> 00:25:24,830
for what happened to you.

542
00:25:25,860 --> 00:25:27,100
Shanshan and your child died.

543
00:25:27,410 --> 00:25:28,470
I'm sad too,

544
00:25:29,190 --> 00:25:30,310
but I won't accept

545
00:25:30,390 --> 00:25:32,240
your indiscriminate accusations.

546
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:33,530
Please entrust a third party

547
00:25:34,160 --> 00:25:35,650
to properly examine the miscarriage

548
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:37,420
and Zhou Shanshan's death.

549
00:25:37,740 --> 00:25:39,100
I'll accept any result.

550
00:25:39,340 --> 00:25:40,930
Stop acting like a scientist.

551
00:25:41,060 --> 00:25:42,070
You talk about your technology

552
00:25:42,110 --> 00:25:43,240
as if it's miraculous,

553
00:25:44,340 --> 00:25:46,050
but it's not mature at all!

554
00:25:46,340 --> 00:25:47,860
Shanshan was just your experiment,

555
00:25:47,980 --> 00:25:49,440
a failed experiment!

556
00:25:50,280 --> 00:25:51,630
You swindled so much money from me!

557
00:25:51,710 --> 00:25:52,350
This isn't over between us!

558
00:25:52,350 --> 00:25:53,430
Cao Jian, calm down!

559
00:25:53,430 --> 00:25:54,580
This is the police station!

560
00:25:55,020 --> 00:25:55,840
Give me back my money!

561
00:25:57,010 --> 00:25:58,540
You can insult me,

562
00:25:59,850 --> 00:26:00,620
but you can't

563
00:26:00,670 --> 00:26:01,750
deny my research

564
00:26:02,140 --> 00:26:03,160
or science.

565
00:26:03,480 --> 00:26:05,340
Science? Bullshit!

566
00:26:05,470 --> 00:26:06,250
Listen up,

567
00:26:06,590 --> 00:26:08,250
you and your Kailai Biotechnology

568
00:26:08,280 --> 00:26:09,210
are finished!

569
00:26:20,150 --> 00:26:20,740
Are you okay?

570
00:26:46,770 --> 00:26:47,400
Shen Yi.

571
00:26:51,150 --> 00:26:52,110
Can you understand me?

572
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:01,550
Many years ago,

573
00:27:04,140 --> 00:27:05,470
I said something

574
00:27:05,470 --> 00:27:06,350
to a criminal.

575
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:11,130
"Being different

576
00:27:11,480 --> 00:27:12,780
might mean misunderstanding,

577
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:16,590
but it should be respected."

578
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:19,590
I also need to face

579
00:27:19,590 --> 00:27:20,550
my own inner self.

580
00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:25,120
Now, for me,

581
00:27:25,670 --> 00:27:27,220
that perfect embryo

582
00:27:27,300 --> 00:27:28,900
is what interests me the most.

583
00:27:29,710 --> 00:27:30,910
It had been eight months.

584
00:27:31,460 --> 00:27:32,800
Only one step away

585
00:27:34,500 --> 00:27:36,120
from success.

586
00:27:44,020 --> 00:27:45,110
What you just said

587
00:27:45,110 --> 00:27:46,260
to Du Cheng…

588
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:49,110
Wasn't it a bit too harsh?

589
00:27:58,470 --> 00:27:59,100
I believe in you.

590
00:28:01,950 --> 00:28:02,950
You can definitely understand me.

591
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:17,660
Back to the studio.

592
00:28:19,950 --> 00:28:21,050
Okay, Professor Fang.

593
00:28:31,770 --> 00:28:33,070
So, what's moving on the screen

594
00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:36,440
is the gene editing tool,

595
00:28:36,470 --> 00:28:37,710
CRISPR/Cas9?

596
00:28:38,120 --> 00:28:38,670
Yes.

597
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:40,830
I used it to edit out

598
00:28:40,870 --> 00:28:42,030
the MAOA gene mutation

599
00:28:42,060 --> 00:28:43,460
inherited from Cao Jian.

600
00:28:44,710 --> 00:28:46,700
The hormones that were triggers for violence

601
00:28:47,030 --> 00:28:48,790
would become a source of creativity.

602
00:28:50,250 --> 00:28:52,110
The baby would have a stronger immune system,

603
00:28:52,550 --> 00:28:54,120
enhanced ability to repair damage,

604
00:28:54,600 --> 00:28:56,290
and theoretically be more stress-resistant.

605
00:28:56,630 --> 00:28:57,560
None of this

606
00:28:57,590 --> 00:28:58,480
could guarantee

607
00:28:58,510 --> 00:28:59,830
he'd become an elite,

608
00:29:03,860 --> 00:29:05,190
but so far,

609
00:29:05,980 --> 00:29:07,270
in my field of knowledge,

610
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:08,650
he was the most perfect baby.

611
00:29:16,100 --> 00:29:17,210
The most perfect baby.

612
00:29:19,610 --> 00:29:21,470
Unfortunately, he's gone.

613
00:29:23,630 --> 00:29:24,550
I want to use painting

614
00:29:24,580 --> 00:29:25,870
to preserve this perfection

615
00:29:27,190 --> 00:29:28,750
so that more people can see it.

616
00:29:34,830 --> 00:29:35,910
I've always believed

617
00:29:36,920 --> 00:29:37,670
that my mission

618
00:29:38,140 --> 00:29:39,350
is to use genetic science

619
00:29:39,390 --> 00:29:40,750
to fix the Creator's flaws

620
00:29:41,870 --> 00:29:43,270
and to create a human race that

621
00:29:44,010 --> 00:29:45,850
becomes better with each generation.

622
00:29:51,530 --> 00:29:53,240
Implanting the edited embryo

623
00:29:53,800 --> 00:29:55,240
into Zhou Shanshan's body

624
00:29:57,870 --> 00:29:58,750
is the most amazing thing

625
00:29:58,750 --> 00:29:59,830
you've done.

626
00:30:04,250 --> 00:30:05,690
What a pity.

627
00:30:09,350 --> 00:30:10,750
You were so close to success.

628
00:30:13,190 --> 00:30:13,950
If it had worked out,

629
00:30:15,270 --> 00:30:16,350
this would be

630
00:30:16,350 --> 00:30:17,750
your most perfect gene editing.

631
00:30:21,500 --> 00:30:23,030
I'm glad he wasn't born.

632
00:30:25,630 --> 00:30:27,050
I've been checking

633
00:30:27,090 --> 00:30:28,650
Zhou Shanshan's test records,

634
00:30:29,880 --> 00:30:30,870
but I still haven't found out

635
00:30:30,910 --> 00:30:31,950
where exactly the problem lies.

636
00:30:35,850 --> 00:30:37,130
Could it be that

637
00:30:37,790 --> 00:30:39,000
the original editing

638
00:30:39,030 --> 00:30:40,150
triggered other issues,

639
00:30:40,670 --> 00:30:41,920
which led to the sudden stop

640
00:30:43,340 --> 00:30:44,770
of the baby's growth?

641
00:30:46,290 --> 00:30:47,680
Experiments always come with risks.

642
00:30:53,110 --> 00:30:54,540
Genes mutate, you know.

643
00:30:55,750 --> 00:30:57,100
With this flaw fixed,

644
00:30:58,230 --> 00:30:59,350
another flaw will show.

645
00:31:05,190 --> 00:31:05,910
It's just like

646
00:31:05,950 --> 00:31:07,190
the Human Nature Atlas I tried to develop.

647
00:31:08,050 --> 00:31:08,960
Too many variables.

648
00:31:10,820 --> 00:31:12,110
With each confirmation,

649
00:31:12,510 --> 00:31:13,750
new problems arose.

650
00:31:15,150 --> 00:31:15,790
Even now,

651
00:31:15,790 --> 00:31:16,950
I still haven't developed a complete system.

652
00:31:18,950 --> 00:31:19,430
But this isn't

653
00:31:19,430 --> 00:31:20,310
a reason to stop us.

654
00:31:47,450 --> 00:31:48,310
What's this?

655
00:31:49,100 --> 00:31:49,790
This is a

656
00:31:49,790 --> 00:31:50,580
DNA diffraction image.

657
00:31:53,610 --> 00:31:54,750
Its name is

658
00:31:55,340 --> 00:31:56,540
Photo 51.

659
00:31:57,640 --> 00:31:58,870
Do you know who my role model is?

660
00:32:00,860 --> 00:32:01,630
No.

661
00:32:02,430 --> 00:32:03,550
James Watson.

662
00:32:05,570 --> 00:32:06,550
He and Crick

663
00:32:06,570 --> 00:32:07,390
discovered the double helix structure

664
00:32:07,410 --> 00:32:08,340
of DNA,

665
00:32:09,010 --> 00:32:10,890
ushering in the era of molecular biology.

666
00:32:11,640 --> 00:32:13,370
They won the Nobel Prize for it.

667
00:32:14,600 --> 00:32:15,750
This photo

668
00:32:16,470 --> 00:32:17,480
was taken by a female scientist

669
00:32:17,510 --> 00:32:18,630
named Franklin.

670
00:32:19,150 --> 00:32:20,110
Watson

671
00:32:20,110 --> 00:32:21,150
saw this photo

672
00:32:22,070 --> 00:32:22,970
and keenly captured

673
00:32:23,010 --> 00:32:24,170
its shape and appearance.

674
00:32:24,590 --> 00:32:25,440
Then he was sure that

675
00:32:25,710 --> 00:32:26,640
the structure of DNA

676
00:32:26,680 --> 00:32:27,470
was a double helix.

677
00:32:28,570 --> 00:32:29,470
So Watson's winning

678
00:32:29,510 --> 00:32:30,790
the Nobel Prize was highly controversial.

679
00:32:31,190 --> 00:32:32,820
Some say he cobbled together

680
00:32:32,850 --> 00:32:34,090
many people's research results.

681
00:32:35,110 --> 00:32:35,990
What's the truth?

682
00:32:36,800 --> 00:32:37,600
That is the truth.

683
00:32:39,110 --> 00:32:39,830
But regardless of

684
00:32:39,880 --> 00:32:40,990
how much controversy it caused,

685
00:32:41,590 --> 00:32:43,030
he is the father of DNA science.

686
00:32:51,230 --> 00:32:52,670
People can only see the results,

687
00:32:53,640 --> 00:32:54,560
not the process.

688
00:32:55,470 --> 00:32:56,190
Moreover,

689
00:32:58,710 --> 00:33:00,150
without Crick's help,

690
00:33:00,910 --> 00:33:02,390
Watson wouldn't have succeeded.

691
00:33:06,540 --> 00:33:07,830
On the path to your goal,

692
00:33:08,270 --> 00:33:09,270
companions are important.

693
00:33:11,470 --> 00:33:12,070
Shen Yi.

694
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:16,150
Your choice is right.

695
00:33:19,430 --> 00:33:20,940
I'm going to continue my experiments.

696
00:33:21,540 --> 00:33:23,460
Wish me success

697
00:33:23,910 --> 00:33:25,280
after countless failures.

698
00:34:07,510 --> 00:34:11,100
(Beijiang Criminal Investigation Team)

699
00:34:47,840 --> 00:34:49,230
To analyze complicated human nature

700
00:34:49,929 --> 00:34:50,860
and categorize it

701
00:34:51,730 --> 00:34:53,860
is why I want to create the Human Nature Atlas.

702
00:34:58,480 --> 00:34:59,320
I think

703
00:34:59,740 --> 00:35:01,150
her murders were not entirely

704
00:35:01,150 --> 00:35:02,770
motivated by love.

705
00:35:03,030 --> 00:35:04,710
I have to draw this devil.

706
00:35:05,570 --> 00:35:06,820
We're the police.

707
00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:08,830
Our job is to find the truth

708
00:35:08,870 --> 00:35:09,930
and catch the murderer.

709
00:35:10,580 --> 00:35:12,050
But as a profiler,

710
00:35:12,590 --> 00:35:13,430
if I can't capture

711
00:35:13,470 --> 00:35:14,360
the criminal's personality

712
00:35:14,390 --> 00:35:15,750
hidden in their heart,

713
00:35:16,380 --> 00:35:18,030
my work will never be complete.

714
00:35:19,060 --> 00:35:20,700
Drawing the appearance doesn't matter.

715
00:35:21,450 --> 00:35:22,310
What I want to draw

716
00:35:23,900 --> 00:35:24,700
is the heart.

717
00:35:27,880 --> 00:35:28,630
I want to apply

718
00:35:28,670 --> 00:35:30,060
to visit some felons.

719
00:35:32,660 --> 00:35:33,320
Shen Yi.

720
00:35:33,830 --> 00:35:35,620
You can do research,

721
00:35:35,830 --> 00:35:37,320
but you can't act rashly.

722
00:35:37,570 --> 00:35:38,560
If I can express

723
00:35:38,590 --> 00:35:40,250
these things through paintings and colors

724
00:35:40,270 --> 00:35:41,590
and understand criminal personalities,

725
00:35:41,870 --> 00:35:42,590
then maybe in the future

726
00:35:42,630 --> 00:35:43,470
I can predict a crime

727
00:35:43,510 --> 00:35:44,350
before it's committed.

728
00:35:44,390 --> 00:35:45,170
Shen Yi,

729
00:35:45,880 --> 00:35:47,370
it's all in the past.

730
00:35:47,620 --> 00:35:49,060
Don't push yourself too hard.

731
00:35:50,790 --> 00:35:51,870
I can no longer control

732
00:35:51,870 --> 00:35:53,310
the impulses brought by

733
00:35:53,310 --> 00:35:54,350
my subjective feelings and intuition.

734
00:35:55,100 --> 00:35:55,990
If my instincts

735
00:35:56,030 --> 00:35:56,790
make me no longer suitable

736
00:35:56,820 --> 00:35:57,970
for a profiler,

737
00:35:58,730 --> 00:36:00,180
I'll let them guide me

738
00:36:00,740 --> 00:36:02,290
to do something more meaningful.

739
00:36:17,560 --> 00:36:18,750
I'm just a painter!

740
00:36:18,790 --> 00:36:19,950
I'm not a cop!

741
00:36:19,950 --> 00:36:20,730
It's you who can't catch the criminal.

742
00:36:20,760 --> 00:36:22,100
Why blame me?

743
00:36:22,130 --> 00:36:24,010
Your painting caused a police officer's death!

744
00:36:24,350 --> 00:36:25,670
Your paintings only bring harm.

745
00:36:25,880 --> 00:36:27,320
You don't deserve to be a painter.

746
00:36:30,210 --> 00:36:32,110
You can't even draw a face.

747
00:36:33,500 --> 00:36:34,630
How dare you show up here?

748
00:36:34,760 --> 00:36:36,560
I hope I can help you in the future.

749
00:36:36,580 --> 00:36:38,360
Just when I was about to drown…

750
00:36:41,980 --> 00:36:43,700
I almost saw that face.

751
00:36:43,980 --> 00:36:46,020
I must have that near-death experience again.

752
00:37:11,320 --> 00:37:12,640
I know you've done your best.

753
00:37:13,520 --> 00:37:14,690
If you can't draw it, it's okay.

754
00:37:14,900 --> 00:37:15,850
I won't blame you.

755
00:37:20,620 --> 00:37:22,270
Did I draw it wrong?

756
00:37:24,210 --> 00:37:24,790
No.

757
00:37:28,740 --> 00:37:29,710
I believe in you.

758
00:37:30,700 --> 00:37:32,800
Can't you let Shen Yi go?

759
00:37:32,940 --> 00:37:34,980
It's so difficult to cultivate

760
00:37:35,010 --> 00:37:36,290
an artist like him.

761
00:37:36,510 --> 00:37:37,390
Return Shen Yi

762
00:37:38,260 --> 00:37:40,030
to art.

763
00:37:40,490 --> 00:37:41,080
No.

764
00:37:42,180 --> 00:37:44,680
He has the ability to see through people's hearts from their faces.

765
00:37:44,930 --> 00:37:47,450
He has the qualities to become an excellent police officer.

766
00:37:48,420 --> 00:37:49,530
I'm very grateful.

767
00:37:55,510 --> 00:37:56,860
When I was young,

768
00:37:58,080 --> 00:38:00,530
Mr. Xu led me into the world of art.

769
00:38:01,010 --> 00:38:02,080
As if by fate,

770
00:38:02,260 --> 00:38:03,540
Captain Lei helped me find

771
00:38:03,540 --> 00:38:05,150
where I truly belong.

772
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:22,810

(Reject) (Answer)

774
00:38:56,270 --> 00:38:56,980
Go ahead.

775
00:38:59,630 --> 00:39:01,190
What is your real intention?

776
00:39:09,250 --> 00:39:10,510
Fang Kaiyi didn't deny

777
00:39:10,510 --> 00:39:11,670
that Zhou Shanshan's baby

778
00:39:11,710 --> 00:39:12,590
was edited

779
00:39:12,590 --> 00:39:13,830
and implanted by him as an experiment.

780
00:39:14,030 --> 00:39:15,160
I can find evidence.

781
00:39:17,560 --> 00:39:19,730
I want to persuade Fang Kaiyi to turn himself in.

782
00:39:21,630 --> 00:39:22,310
Why?

783
00:39:24,540 --> 00:39:25,930
Because he and I are the same kind.

784
00:39:28,910 --> 00:39:30,540
I used to be like him.

785
00:39:32,870 --> 00:39:34,420
I know what he's obsessed with.

786
00:39:43,350 --> 00:39:44,960
Do you think he'll listen to you

787
00:39:46,260 --> 00:39:47,470
and turn himself in?

788
00:39:51,670 --> 00:39:52,390
When Fang Kaiyi

789
00:39:52,430 --> 00:39:53,990
saw my paintings for the first time,

790
00:39:55,490 --> 00:39:56,460
he said

791
00:39:57,020 --> 00:39:58,780
if I weren't a police officer,

792
00:40:00,760 --> 00:40:02,900
I might be a criminal genius.

793
00:40:06,140 --> 00:40:07,580
I thought it was ridiculous at the time.

794
00:40:11,430 --> 00:40:12,240
But when I started

795
00:40:12,280 --> 00:40:13,510
recalling my past,

796
00:40:14,840 --> 00:40:15,870
I realized that…

797
00:40:18,450 --> 00:40:19,730
if I hadn't met you

798
00:40:20,980 --> 00:40:21,890
and Captain Lei

799
00:40:23,340 --> 00:40:24,520
in my life,

800
00:40:26,080 --> 00:40:27,890
I might have gotten caught up in my obsessions

801
00:40:29,750 --> 00:40:31,500
like Fang Kaiyi

802
00:40:33,540 --> 00:40:34,780
and slowly sunk into the abyss.

803
00:40:39,860 --> 00:40:40,460
So,

804
00:40:41,240 --> 00:40:42,190
this is the only chance

805
00:40:42,230 --> 00:40:43,270
to make him

806
00:40:43,290 --> 00:40:44,540
let go of his obsessions.

807
00:40:48,460 --> 00:40:50,240
I know this idea is risky

808
00:40:50,740 --> 00:40:51,590
and immature,

809
00:40:54,310 --> 00:40:55,110
but I want to do

810
00:40:55,110 --> 00:40:56,110
what you did back then:

811
00:40:58,220 --> 00:41:00,000
point him in the right direction.

812
00:41:01,360 --> 00:41:02,310
Leave this matter

813
00:41:03,670 --> 00:41:04,740
to me.

814
00:41:19,240 --> 00:41:20,340
You're still on leave.

815
00:41:22,670 --> 00:41:24,270
You don't need my permission to do what you want.

816
00:41:31,460 --> 00:41:33,180
This time, no matter what happens,

817
00:41:34,190 --> 00:41:35,590
I'll notify you immediately.

818
00:41:39,860 --> 00:41:40,970
A paintbrush

819
00:41:42,030 --> 00:41:43,650
can draw different colors,

820
00:41:46,540 --> 00:41:48,380
but the brush itself won't change.
