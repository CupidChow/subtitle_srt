(Under the Skin Ⅱ)

2
00:01:43,340 --> 00:01:46,090
(Episode 21)

3
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:54,710
Mr. Cao,

4
00:01:55,570 --> 00:01:56,509
we're from the Beijiang Branch

5
00:01:56,509 --> 00:01:57,229
Criminal Investigation Unit.

6
00:01:57,460 --> 00:01:58,170
I'm Du Cheng

7
00:01:58,710 --> 00:01:59,700
and this is my colleague, Shen Yi.

8
00:02:02,350 --> 00:02:03,070
Are you

9
00:02:03,510 --> 00:02:04,670
Du Qing's brother?

10
00:02:06,940 --> 00:02:07,470
Yes,

11
00:02:07,940 --> 00:02:08,970
you know my sister?

12
00:02:09,580 --> 00:02:10,190
I do.

13
00:02:10,669 --> 00:02:11,780
We've known each other for many years.

14
00:02:12,430 --> 00:02:13,830
We used to run into each other in Europe all the time.

15
00:02:14,270 --> 00:02:15,180
She often mentioned

16
00:02:15,420 --> 00:02:16,630
that she had a police brother.

17
00:02:16,670 --> 00:02:17,150
Mr. Cao,

18
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:19,670
let's talk about the case.

19
00:02:19,990 --> 00:02:20,470
Alright.

20
00:02:20,780 --> 00:02:21,579
Come, sit.

21
00:02:26,420 --> 00:02:27,680
We'd like to know

22
00:02:28,390 --> 00:02:30,190
when was the last time

23
00:02:30,590 --> 00:02:31,430
you saw your wife.

24
00:02:34,750 --> 00:02:35,630
On the 22nd.

25
00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:37,790
That day,

26
00:02:38,510 --> 00:02:39,510
my son came home

27
00:02:40,350 --> 00:02:41,590
and we had dinner at home.

28
00:02:42,940 --> 00:02:44,630
The next morning at 6 AM,

29
00:02:45,070 --> 00:02:46,390
I went to the airport for a business trip.

30
00:02:46,950 --> 00:02:48,110
When did you

31
00:02:48,420 --> 00:02:49,630
discover that your wife had been killed?

32
00:02:51,890 --> 00:02:53,010
Just this morning.

33
00:02:56,230 --> 00:02:57,390
After I returned,

34
00:02:58,190 --> 00:02:59,860
I heard my secretary screaming.

35
00:03:00,830 --> 00:03:02,390
Then I went to the cold storage

36
00:03:02,710 --> 00:03:03,630
and saw my wife

37
00:03:03,630 --> 00:03:04,430
lying in there.

38
00:03:06,540 --> 00:03:07,700
Then I called the police.

39
00:03:08,590 --> 00:03:09,680
Is it possible

40
00:03:10,350 --> 00:03:11,420
that this case

41
00:03:11,610 --> 00:03:12,800
is related to your business?

42
00:03:13,580 --> 00:03:14,670
In my business dealings,

43
00:03:14,750 --> 00:03:15,630
I've never

44
00:03:15,630 --> 00:03:16,430
made any enemies.

45
00:03:21,370 --> 00:03:22,070
Do you usually

46
00:03:22,070 --> 00:03:23,110
live with your wife?

47
00:03:23,829 --> 00:03:24,310
No.

48
00:03:24,390 --> 00:03:25,430
We sleep in separate rooms.

49
00:03:26,550 --> 00:03:27,550
I'm usually busy

50
00:03:28,230 --> 00:03:29,230
and she's a light sleeper,

51
00:03:29,670 --> 00:03:30,760
so we sleep separately.

52
00:03:31,070 --> 00:03:32,100
That way we don't disturb each other.

53
00:03:33,310 --> 00:03:34,070
Where's your son?

54
00:03:34,270 --> 00:03:34,829
Does he live here?

55
00:03:35,350 --> 00:03:36,520
I didn't see his room.

56
00:03:38,030 --> 00:03:39,310
He lives alone outside.

57
00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:42,310
Let me in!

58
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:44,410
Let me in to see!

59
00:03:45,050 --> 00:03:45,790
Calm down!

60
00:03:45,829 --> 00:03:46,230
Cao Jian,

61
00:03:46,300 --> 00:03:47,430
you selfish bastard!

62
00:03:48,110 --> 00:03:48,710
Calm down!

63
00:03:55,390 --> 00:03:57,210
You never cared about my mom.

64
00:03:58,310 --> 00:04:00,230
I should have made her leave you long ago.

65
00:04:01,430 --> 00:04:02,640
What are you talking about?

66
00:04:04,740 --> 00:04:05,390
Mr. Cao,

67
00:04:06,190 --> 00:04:06,910
would it be alright

68
00:04:07,710 --> 00:04:08,710
if we speak with your son

69
00:04:08,710 --> 00:04:09,510
for a few minutes?

70
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:13,670
Alright.

71
00:04:26,230 --> 00:04:26,750
Don't be fooled

72
00:04:26,750 --> 00:04:27,830
by how put-together he looks.

73
00:04:28,430 --> 00:04:29,220
Everything he has today

74
00:04:29,570 --> 00:04:31,070
is all thanks to my mom.

75
00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:38,550
When was the last time you saw

76
00:04:38,850 --> 00:04:39,790
your mother?

77
00:04:45,510 --> 00:04:46,990
I think it was on the evening of the 22nd.

78
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:50,550
I came home for dinner.

79
00:04:53,870 --> 00:04:54,909
If I'd known, I wouldn't have

80
00:04:54,909 --> 00:04:55,830
gone back that night.

81
00:05:02,390 --> 00:05:03,580
You and your father

82
00:05:04,350 --> 00:05:05,350
don't have a good relationship?

83
00:05:07,270 --> 00:05:09,110
Although he gave birth to me,

84
00:05:09,870 --> 00:05:12,310
I'll never respect him.

The deceased, Liu Yao,
(Beijiang City Public Security Bureau, Beijiang Branch)

87
00:05:22,740 --> 00:05:23,590
The deceased, Liu Yao,

88
00:05:24,620 --> 00:05:24,720
was 58 years old.

89
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:25,560

(Basic information) (Name: Liu Yao)

91
00:05:25,750 --> 00:05:27,620
She and her husband, Cao Jian, were schoolmates.
(Basic information) (Name: Liu Yao)

92
00:05:27,870 --> 00:05:29,150
After graduation, they started a business together

93
00:05:29,230 --> 00:05:30,670
and established a real estate company.

94
00:05:31,430 --> 00:05:32,950
After having their son, Cao Xiaodong,

95
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:34,070
she gradually stepped back

96
00:05:34,590 --> 00:05:35,870
and handed over full control of the company to

97
00:05:35,909 --> 00:05:36,710
her husband, Cao Jian,

98
00:05:37,150 --> 00:05:38,590
to focus on taking care of their child at home.

(Basic information) (Name: Cao Jian)

is Liu Yao's husband, Cao Jian.
(Basic information) (Name: Cao Jian)

104
00:05:43,750 --> 00:05:44,750
After taking over the company,

105
00:05:44,830 --> 00:05:45,800
he expanded the original business

106
00:05:45,830 --> 00:05:46,870
to the hotel,

107
00:05:46,990 --> 00:05:48,230
entertainment, catering,

108
00:05:48,390 --> 00:05:49,270
and healthcare sectors.

109
00:05:49,550 --> 00:05:51,110
He's a well-known entrepreneur in this city.

110
00:05:51,460 --> 00:05:51,630
(Basic information) (Name: Cao Jian)

111
00:05:51,630 --> 00:05:52,909
I think I've seen
(Basic information) (Name: Cao Jian)

112
00:05:52,909 --> 00:05:53,860
some gossip about their family.
(Basic information) (Name: Cao Jian)

113
00:05:54,159 --> 00:05:56,150
It said Liu Yao's family already had

114
00:05:56,190 --> 00:05:58,010
a listed company, a big corporation.

115
00:05:58,430 --> 00:05:59,550
Cao Jian's success

116
00:05:59,550 --> 00:06:00,590
was entirely due to Liu Yao.

117
00:06:00,900 --> 00:06:02,390
Could this be a case of

118
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:03,910
a wealthy family feud?

119
00:06:04,950 --> 00:06:05,830
It's possible.

120

(Basic information) (Name: Cao Xiaodong)

Cao Xiaodong.
(Basic information) (Name: Cao Xiaodong)

127
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:13,590
Under his mother's care,

128
00:06:13,620 --> 00:06:14,920
he was admitted to an Ivy League school in the US.

129
00:06:15,150 --> 00:06:15,270
After graduating and returning to China,

130
00:06:15,270 --> 00:06:16,030
(Basic information) (Name: Cao Xiaodong)
After graduating and returning to China,

131
00:06:16,030 --> 00:06:17,900
he rotated through positions in the family company.

(Basic information) (Name: Cao Xiaodong)

00:06:17,990 --> 00:06:19,070
After three years of rotation,
(Basic information) (Name: Cao Xiaodong)

134
00:06:19,110 --> 00:06:20,110
for unknown reasons,

135
00:06:20,180 --> 00:06:21,450
he was assigned to

136
00:06:21,510 --> 00:06:22,860
a club under the group

137
00:06:22,890 --> 00:06:23,720
as the general manager.

138
00:06:24,380 --> 00:06:25,060
A club?

139
00:06:26,230 --> 00:06:27,720
Shouldn't such a foreign-educated second generation

140
00:06:27,780 --> 00:06:29,040
be trained as

141
00:06:29,070 --> 00:06:30,390
the heir to

142
00:06:30,430 --> 00:06:31,240
the family business?

143
00:06:31,550 --> 00:06:33,310
Why would he be managing a club instead?

144
00:06:35,390 --> 00:06:36,060
Ask him.

145
00:06:36,630 --> 00:06:37,590
No one here

146
00:06:37,659 --> 00:06:38,350
knows better than him,

147
00:06:39,190 --> 00:06:40,630
right, Mr. Du?

148
00:06:44,180 --> 00:06:45,230
He must have been disobedient.

149
00:06:46,780 --> 00:06:48,020
What did the forensics team find?

150
00:06:48,909 --> 00:06:50,390
The preliminary cause of death is

151
00:06:50,409 --> 00:06:51,210
multiple penetrating wounds

152
00:06:51,270 --> 00:06:52,670
to the abdominal organs from a sharp instrument.

153
00:06:52,890 --> 00:06:54,590
However, due to the freezing of the body,

154
00:06:54,670 --> 00:06:55,590
the exact time of death

155
00:06:55,630 --> 00:06:56,870
still requires a detailed autopsy.

156
00:06:58,140 --> 00:06:58,550
(Basic information) (Name: Cao Xiaodong)

157
00:06:58,800 --> 00:06:59,510
However, we

158
00:06:59,510 --> 00:07:00,510
collected an unknown fingerprint

159
00:07:00,550 --> 00:07:01,350
on the doorknob

160
00:07:01,390 --> 00:07:02,880
at the first crime scene,

161
00:07:02,910 --> 00:07:04,360
other than those of the victim's family and secretary.

162
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:06,470
It could very likely be from the killer,

163
00:07:06,490 --> 00:07:08,070
but there's no match in the database yet.

164
00:07:10,700 --> 00:07:12,120
What did the surveillance footage show?

165
00:07:12,590 --> 00:07:13,510
The footage confirms

166
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:14,670
Cao Xiaodong and Cao Jian's

167
00:07:14,670 --> 00:07:16,000
departure times are accurate,

168
00:07:16,150 --> 00:07:18,230
but I found a suspicious person.

169
00:07:19,270 --> 00:07:19,350
It's this person.

170
00:07:19,350 --> 00:07:20,040
(CCTV Zone D)
It's this person.

(CCTV Zone A)

182
00:07:31,620 --> 00:07:32,550
he changed into a new set of clothes
(CCTV Zone A)

183
00:07:32,550 --> 00:07:33,150
and came out.

He was carrying a duffel bag in his hand.

189
00:07:35,670 --> 00:07:37,310
It seems that the bag

(CCTV Zone D)

191
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:38,350
was full of stuff.
(CCTV Zone D)

192
00:07:38,830 --> 00:07:39,830
Unfortunately,

193
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,580
this person was wearing a hat and a mask.

194
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:42,450
We can't see his face clearly.

195
00:07:48,630 --> 00:07:49,430
Where's Shen Yi?

196
00:07:50,150 --> 00:07:51,510
He's working on the reconstruction now.

197
00:07:53,030 --> 00:07:53,720

00:07:58,110 --> 00:07:58,830
Look,

202
00:07:58,830 --> 00:07:59,630
this person enters the complex

204
00:07:59,670 --> 00:08:00,630
and goes straight into the Cao family's house.

(CCTV Zone D)

206
00:08:01,150 --> 00:08:02,590
This indicates that he's familiar with
(CCTV Zone D)

207
00:08:02,670 --> 00:08:03,790
both the complex and the Cao family's house.

208

Jiang Feng,

209
00:08:07,510 --> 00:08:08,900
go to the property management office

210
00:08:08,990 --> 00:08:10,230
and investigate who has entered

211
00:08:10,310 --> 00:08:11,300
the Cao family's house in the past half month,

212
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:11,910
including

213
00:08:11,910 --> 00:08:12,830
the internal staff of the property management.

214
00:08:13,060 --> 00:08:13,590
Understood.

215
00:08:17,990 --> 00:08:18,660
Everyone,

216
00:08:19,310 --> 00:08:19,990
I've reconstructed the person

217
00:08:20,010 --> 00:08:20,100
from the surveillance footage.

218
00:08:20,100 --> 00:08:21,060

from the surveillance footage.

220
00:08:23,110 --> 00:08:23,790
This person

(CCTV Zone D)

222
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:25,390
has distinctive facial features.

(CCTV Zone D)

224
00:08:25,410 --> 00:08:26,300
His cheeks are sunken
(CCTV Zone D)

225
00:08:26,300 --> 00:08:26,390
(CCTV Zone D)

226
00:08:26,390 --> 00:08:27,150
and he has no eyebrows.
(CCTV Zone D)

227
00:08:30,030 --> 00:08:31,430
I have a bold speculation.

228
00:08:32,110 --> 00:08:34,270
He might have undergone chemotherapy before

229
00:08:34,909 --> 00:08:35,909
and is a cancer patient.

230
00:08:36,390 --> 00:08:37,710
A cancer patient?

231
00:08:38,309 --> 00:08:39,150
Cancer patients

232
00:08:39,230 --> 00:08:40,309
who have reached the chemotherapy stage

233
00:08:40,450 --> 00:08:41,549
usually lose a lot of weight.

234
00:08:41,870 --> 00:08:43,539
So his original appearance...

235
00:08:46,710 --> 00:08:47,510
should be like this.

236
00:08:52,670 --> 00:08:53,670
That's Ji Jun!

237
00:08:54,030 --> 00:08:55,150
He used to be a security guard in this complex.

238
00:08:55,510 --> 00:08:56,390
He was very capable.

239
00:08:56,510 --> 00:08:57,240
Many homeowners

240
00:08:57,240 --> 00:08:58,030
would specifically ask for his help

241
00:08:58,120 --> 00:08:59,270
when they needed something done,

242
00:08:59,710 --> 00:09:00,710
like

243
00:09:00,870 --> 00:09:01,620

244
00:09:01,710 --> 00:09:02,350
greeting guests,

245
00:09:02,490 --> 00:09:03,740
closing windows, locking doors, and such.

246
00:09:03,790 --> 00:09:04,590
He did all these tasks very well.

247
00:09:05,210 --> 00:09:06,150
So you're saying

248
00:09:06,350 --> 00:09:07,390
he knows the passcodes

249
00:09:07,390 --> 00:09:08,310
to the homeowners' digital locks?

250
00:09:09,870 --> 00:09:10,590
Where is he now?

251
00:09:11,150 --> 00:09:12,270
He quit three months ago.

252
00:09:12,750 --> 00:09:13,630
Pancreatic cancer.

253
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:14,910
It was already late-stage when discovered.

Yes,

258
00:09:19,430 --> 00:09:20,630
he turned in his work badge when he left.

259
00:09:20,650 --> 00:09:21,510
I still have it.

260
00:09:21,860 --> 00:09:22,510
Where does he live?

261
00:09:36,570 --> 00:09:37,700
Ji Jun, right?

262
00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:46,320
Don't move!

Don't!

Go!

What fingerprint?

281
00:10:06,850 --> 00:10:07,890
What happened?

282

Captain Cheng,

the first room

284

only has basic personal belongings.

nothing was found in the second room either.

The stolen goods have been found.

290
00:11:23,220 --> 00:11:23,880
Don't move.

291
00:11:24,840 --> 00:11:25,990
Where did this come from?

292
00:11:26,670 --> 00:11:27,510
I've never seen it before.

293
00:11:28,310 --> 00:11:29,710
Did a resident lose something?

294
00:11:30,500 --> 00:11:31,510
He's been working in that complex

295
00:11:31,540 --> 00:11:33,150
for many years now.

296
00:11:33,230 --> 00:11:33,830
He cares more about the residents

297
00:11:33,870 --> 00:11:35,420
than he does about us.

298
00:11:35,750 --> 00:11:36,630
Has he ever complained to you

299
00:11:36,630 --> 00:11:37,590
about the residents in the complex?

300
00:11:38,110 --> 00:11:39,640
How could he complain?

301
00:11:39,830 --> 00:11:41,310
We can't even repay our gratitude fast enough.

302
00:11:41,310 --> 00:11:42,030
We won't...

303
00:11:43,490 --> 00:11:44,820
No matter what happened,

304
00:11:44,820 --> 00:11:46,750
it can't possibly be related to him.

305
00:11:47,020 --> 00:11:47,590
He...

306
00:11:48,270 --> 00:11:49,510
He doesn't have much time left.

(Beijiang City Public Security Bureau, Beijiang Branch)

308
00:12:06,710 --> 00:12:07,430
You worked as that complex's security guard

309
00:12:07,510 --> 00:12:08,550
for so long.

310
00:12:09,390 --> 00:12:10,550
Are you familiar with Cao Jian's family?

311
00:12:13,080 --> 00:12:13,630
Not really.

312
00:12:15,670 --> 00:12:16,950
Then why did you choose their house?

313
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,350
I had

314
00:12:22,710 --> 00:12:23,550
accidentally seen

315
00:12:23,590 --> 00:12:24,550
their door lock password

316
00:12:24,590 --> 00:12:25,430
and I memorized it.

317
00:12:27,060 --> 00:12:28,440
Plus, they're the wealthiest family there.

318
00:12:29,070 --> 00:12:30,430
Describe the process of your crime in detail.

319
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:35,720
After I entered,

320
00:12:37,030 --> 00:12:38,670
I looked around the first and second floors

321
00:12:39,630 --> 00:12:40,750
but didn't find anything of value,

322
00:12:41,430 --> 00:12:42,540
so I went up to the third floor.

323
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:44,870
In the bedroom on the third floor,

324
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:47,110
I found a lot of jewelry and accessories.

325
00:12:48,070 --> 00:12:49,150
I took them all and left.

326
00:12:49,430 --> 00:12:50,630
Then why did you kill her?

327
00:12:58,710 --> 00:13:00,230
After I came out with the things,

328
00:13:01,030 --> 00:13:02,270
as luck would have it,

329
00:13:02,750 --> 00:13:04,150
I saw Liu Yao

330
00:13:04,190 --> 00:13:05,230
coming out of the bathroom.

331
00:13:09,670 --> 00:13:10,750
I was going to run,

332
00:13:11,430 --> 00:13:12,510
but she saw me.

333
00:13:13,750 --> 00:13:14,780
She even called out my name.

334
00:13:15,390 --> 00:13:16,270
I panicked,

335
00:13:17,390 --> 00:13:18,630
so I decided to go all out.

336
00:13:19,030 --> 00:13:20,190
I pulled out the knife

337
00:13:20,430 --> 00:13:21,190
and stabbed her.

338
00:13:23,070 --> 00:13:24,110
After it was done,

339
00:13:24,830 --> 00:13:26,240
I dragged her to the cold storage room.

340
00:13:27,470 --> 00:13:28,510
I cleaned up the blood.

341
00:13:30,350 --> 00:13:31,590
Then I went up to the second floor to change my clothes

342
00:13:31,590 --> 00:13:32,190
and left.

343
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:41,550
How did you know

344
00:13:41,550 --> 00:13:42,470
they had a cold storage room?

345
00:13:45,290 --> 00:13:46,550
You just said you went to the first floor,

346
00:13:46,630 --> 00:13:47,020
second floor,

347
00:13:47,110 --> 00:13:48,110
and then straight to the third floor.

348
00:13:49,130 --> 00:13:50,350
So how did you know

349
00:13:50,350 --> 00:13:51,860
they had a cold storage room to hide the body?

350
00:13:55,790 --> 00:13:56,390
Well,

351
00:13:56,670 --> 00:13:58,350
I've been in that complex for many years

352
00:13:58,900 --> 00:13:59,590
and

353
00:13:59,830 --> 00:14:01,670
I got a general idea of each household's situation.

354
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:02,910
I learned a bit about everyone.

355
00:14:05,490 --> 00:14:06,460
As for the Cao family,

356
00:14:06,710 --> 00:14:07,670
I had already figured them out long ago.

357
00:14:08,310 --> 00:14:09,430
I advise you to tell the truth.

358
00:14:17,230 --> 00:14:17,910
Officer,

359
00:14:18,350 --> 00:14:18,910
that's enough.

360
00:14:19,550 --> 00:14:20,230
Stop asking questions.

361
00:14:20,630 --> 00:14:21,710
I... I'll confess to everything.

362
00:14:22,150 --> 00:14:22,790
Theft,

363
00:14:23,270 --> 00:14:23,910

murder,

365
00:14:25,710 --> 00:14:26,390
I admit to all of it.

366
00:14:26,990 --> 00:14:27,710
I'll just pay with my life.

367
00:14:28,630 --> 00:14:29,310
What's your motive?

368
00:14:32,180 --> 00:14:33,310
Why did you do this?

369
00:14:36,710 --> 00:14:37,550
Motive?

370
00:14:39,630 --> 00:14:40,630
Look at me.

371
00:14:42,310 --> 00:14:43,540
I have late-stage pancreatic cancer.

372
00:14:44,310 --> 00:14:45,350
I don't have many days left.

00:14:48,740 --> 00:14:50,430
It doesn't matter if I die or not,

374
00:14:53,110 --> 00:14:54,710
but my wife doesn't have a job,

375
00:14:55,740 --> 00:14:56,790
and her health isn't good either.

376
00:14:57,390 --> 00:14:58,790
My child is still in school.

377
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:01,190
The whole family depends on me

378
00:15:01,190 --> 00:15:02,310
to earn money.

379
00:15:06,060 --> 00:15:07,110
I worked as a security guard

380
00:15:08,100 --> 00:15:09,270
and don't have many savings.

381
00:15:10,910 --> 00:15:11,990
If I die,

382
00:15:13,750 --> 00:15:14,750
how will they survive?

383
00:15:19,910 --> 00:15:21,110
As long as it's for them,

384
00:15:22,510 --> 00:15:23,470
I'd dare to do anything,

385
00:15:24,260 --> 00:15:25,550
let alone killing someone.

386
00:16:02,940 --> 00:16:03,750
What do you think?

387
00:16:05,550 --> 00:16:06,390
When Ji Jun was describing

388
00:16:06,390 --> 00:16:07,590
the process of killing,

389
00:16:08,250 --> 00:16:09,710
his emotional fluctuations were minimal,

390
00:16:10,630 --> 00:16:11,670
as if he was reciting

391
00:16:11,670 --> 00:16:12,990
a well-prepared script.

392
00:16:14,170 --> 00:16:15,930
But when he mentioned his child,

393
00:16:17,150 --> 00:16:18,500
it was clear

394
00:16:19,750 --> 00:16:20,710
that he was genuinely

395
00:16:20,750 --> 00:16:21,870
worried about the child's future.

396
00:16:26,190 --> 00:16:27,470
When we were at their home,

397
00:16:28,550 --> 00:16:29,910
I could actually sense that

398
00:16:31,310 --> 00:16:32,430
he's a good father.

399
00:16:34,860 --> 00:16:36,390
He wanted to secure

400
00:16:36,910 --> 00:16:38,540
a future for his child.

401
00:16:39,830 --> 00:16:40,550
But why did he ultimately

402
00:16:40,550 --> 00:16:41,620
choose to kill?

403
00:16:43,420 --> 00:16:44,470
I suspect there's more to the story.

404
00:16:45,510 --> 00:16:46,750
I want to take him back to Cao Jian's house

405
00:16:47,830 --> 00:16:49,190
and have him reenact the crime.

406
00:17:14,030 --> 00:17:15,069
It's exactly 10 o'clock now.

407
00:17:15,440 --> 00:17:16,430
I need you to reenact

408
00:17:16,430 --> 00:17:17,109
the crime scene.

409
00:17:18,750 --> 00:17:19,160
Let's go.

410
00:17:37,450 --> 00:17:38,110
Over there.

411
00:17:47,390 --> 00:17:47,990
Right here.

412
00:17:49,640 --> 00:17:50,550
I-I found

413
00:17:50,830 --> 00:17:52,140
a lot of jewelry here.

414
00:17:53,570 --> 00:17:54,640
I got a duffel bag

415
00:17:54,830 --> 00:17:55,750
and packed everything in it.

416
00:17:57,100 --> 00:17:58,000
I was about to leave

417
00:17:58,830 --> 00:18:00,830
when I ran into Liu.

418
00:18:02,510 --> 00:18:03,190
And then?

419
00:18:04,430 --> 00:18:05,230
Then...

420
00:18:06,110 --> 00:18:07,070
I went to the bathroom

421
00:18:07,590 --> 00:18:08,500
and stabbed her to death.

422
00:18:16,620 --> 00:18:17,110
Let's go.

423
00:18:36,430 --> 00:18:37,510
Now, demonstrate

424
00:18:37,910 --> 00:18:38,750
how you moved

425
00:18:38,750 --> 00:18:39,510
Liu Yao's body

426
00:18:39,920 --> 00:18:41,150
to the cold storage in the basement.

427
00:19:12,270 --> 00:19:12,920
I'm getting

428
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:13,780
sicker and sicker now.

429
00:19:14,590 --> 00:19:15,310
My body

430
00:19:15,710 --> 00:19:16,880
isn't as strong as it was before.

431
00:19:17,220 --> 00:19:17,710
Continue.

432
00:19:46,860 --> 00:19:47,300
Alright.

433
00:19:48,870 --> 00:19:49,390
That's enough.

434
00:19:55,950 --> 00:19:56,550
Ji Jun,

435
00:19:57,920 --> 00:19:58,710
you're lying.

436
00:19:59,350 --> 00:20:00,310
You didn't kill her.

437
00:20:02,230 --> 00:20:03,150
I did kill her.

438
00:20:03,710 --> 00:20:04,590
I killed her.

439
00:20:04,920 --> 00:20:06,430
With your current physical condition,

440
00:20:06,580 --> 00:20:08,020
it's impossible for you to drag Liu Yao's body

441
00:20:08,070 --> 00:20:09,230
to the cold storage in the basement.

442
00:20:09,950 --> 00:20:11,450
I did kill her.

443
00:20:12,590 --> 00:20:14,000
My fingerprint is still on it.

444
00:20:16,390 --> 00:20:17,670
We found your thumbprint

445
00:20:17,750 --> 00:20:19,190
on this door handle,

446
00:20:19,670 --> 00:20:21,190
but both the position and direction

447
00:20:21,710 --> 00:20:23,090
are the complete opposite of your actions

448
00:20:24,260 --> 00:20:25,510
just now.

449
00:20:26,750 --> 00:20:27,990
Moreover, when most people open a door,

450
00:20:28,010 --> 00:20:28,710
the fingerprints they leave

451
00:20:28,710 --> 00:20:29,630
are usually incomplete.

452
00:20:30,430 --> 00:20:31,830
But the one we retrieved

453
00:20:31,850 --> 00:20:32,840
was very clear.

454
00:20:33,850 --> 00:20:34,910
So the fingerprint we found

455
00:20:34,910 --> 00:20:35,710
was deliberately left

456
00:20:36,250 --> 00:20:37,530
by someone

457
00:20:37,550 --> 00:20:39,130
to interfere with

458
00:20:39,150 --> 00:20:40,110
our investigation.

459
00:20:41,710 --> 00:20:42,990
What are you hiding from us?

460
00:20:49,710 --> 00:20:50,330
Ji Jun?

461
00:20:50,840 --> 00:20:51,430
Ji Jun!

462
00:20:53,050 --> 00:20:53,780
Call the ambulance!

463
00:20:58,070 --> 00:20:58,710
This way.

464
00:21:07,970 --> 00:21:08,630
Officer Shen,

465
00:21:08,710 --> 00:21:09,510
please have a seat.

466
00:21:09,550 --> 00:21:10,470
Mr. Cao will be here shortly.

467
00:21:10,550 --> 00:21:11,220
Okay, thank you.

468
00:22:22,870 --> 00:22:23,710
Your company's proposal

469
00:22:23,730 --> 00:22:24,310
has been approved.

470
00:22:24,310 --> 00:22:25,470
Can you check if these figures are correct?

471
00:22:30,470 --> 00:22:31,110
Officer Shen,

472
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:33,310
I'm sorry.

473
00:22:33,430 --> 00:22:34,710
I was held up. Sorry to keep you waiting.

474
00:22:34,750 --> 00:22:35,340
It's alright.

475
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:36,750
I'd like to get some more information from you.

476
00:22:37,390 --> 00:22:37,870
Sure.

477
00:22:38,110 --> 00:22:38,880
Come, have a seat.

478
00:22:47,750 --> 00:22:48,470
Officer Shen,

479
00:22:49,350 --> 00:22:50,170
let me guess.

480
00:22:51,270 --> 00:22:52,270
You've heard something,

481
00:22:52,270 --> 00:22:52,710
right?

482
00:22:57,020 --> 00:22:58,990
Someone said I'm a kept man,

483
00:22:59,910 --> 00:23:01,310
that I got my position through my father-in-law,

484
00:23:02,790 --> 00:23:03,640
or maybe

485
00:23:04,990 --> 00:23:06,990
they said I'm used to being suppressed

486
00:23:07,750 --> 00:23:09,550
and my self-esteem was trampled underfoot.

487
00:23:10,190 --> 00:23:11,230
Or did people say

488
00:23:12,390 --> 00:23:13,550
I killed Liu Yao

489
00:23:14,470 --> 00:23:15,660
because I hated her?

490
00:23:17,630 --> 00:23:18,310
Go on.

491
00:23:20,870 --> 00:23:21,590
I admit

492
00:23:22,710 --> 00:23:23,910
that when I married Liu Yao,

493
00:23:24,740 --> 00:23:25,540
it was to

494
00:23:25,910 --> 00:23:27,410
latch onto her father's influence.

495
00:23:28,110 --> 00:23:28,990
In the business world,

496
00:23:29,510 --> 00:23:31,390
connections and resources are everything.

497
00:23:32,470 --> 00:23:33,630
And her father was my

498
00:23:33,630 --> 00:23:34,540
biggest resource

499
00:23:34,630 --> 00:23:35,830
and strongest backing.

500
00:23:37,710 --> 00:23:38,430
A married couple

501
00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:39,670
is a community of interests.

502
00:23:41,390 --> 00:23:42,430
I needed Liu Yao,

503
00:23:43,180 --> 00:23:44,960
but didn't Liu Yao need me too?

504
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:50,890
We've been married for so many years.

505
00:23:51,630 --> 00:23:53,490
Did it really matter if there was love or not?

506
00:23:54,390 --> 00:23:55,030
Now,

507
00:23:55,390 --> 00:23:56,150
my father-in-law

508
00:23:56,190 --> 00:23:57,350
is bedridden.

509
00:23:58,450 --> 00:23:59,390
Even if I'm out there

510
00:23:59,390 --> 00:24:00,310
living it up,

511
00:24:01,330 --> 00:24:02,560
what could Liu Yao do to me?

512
00:24:03,470 --> 00:24:04,020
So tell me,

513
00:24:04,020 --> 00:24:04,920
why would I kill her?

514
00:24:05,750 --> 00:24:06,510
It would make more sense to say

515
00:24:06,510 --> 00:24:07,470
she wanted to kill me.

516
00:24:08,440 --> 00:24:09,670
That would be more logical.

517
00:24:15,110 --> 00:24:16,070
I see you have

518
00:24:16,070 --> 00:24:17,270
quite a collection of oil paintings here.

519
00:24:18,750 --> 00:24:19,220
Yes,

520
00:24:19,750 --> 00:24:21,150
but these paintings aren't mine.

521
00:24:21,910 --> 00:24:22,910
They belong to Liu Yao's family.

522
00:24:24,290 --> 00:24:26,220
They like to vacation in Europe,

523
00:24:26,750 --> 00:24:27,590
browse antique shops,

524
00:24:28,310 --> 00:24:29,790
and occasionally commission buyers

525
00:24:29,910 --> 00:24:30,710
to bid on paintings for them.

526
00:24:33,750 --> 00:24:35,400
Then this painting of Fuxi and Nüwa

527
00:24:35,820 --> 00:24:37,310
probably isn't Liu Yao's, is it?

528
00:24:39,070 --> 00:24:39,910
It's the only

529
00:24:39,910 --> 00:24:40,830
Chinese painting here.

530
00:24:41,510 --> 00:24:43,140
And it has intertwined snakes on it.

531
00:24:44,350 --> 00:24:45,710
Whether in your home

532
00:24:46,530 --> 00:24:47,550
or office,

533
00:24:48,070 --> 00:24:49,510
the caduceus symbol

534
00:24:49,510 --> 00:24:50,510
can be seen everywhere.

535
00:24:51,590 --> 00:24:53,110
Those represent commerce

536
00:24:53,710 --> 00:24:54,230
and trade.

537
00:24:55,310 --> 00:24:56,460
Only this one

538
00:24:57,310 --> 00:24:58,470
symbolizes reproduction.

539
00:24:59,390 --> 00:25:00,230
You

540
00:25:01,550 --> 00:25:02,910
want another child?

541
00:25:09,830 --> 00:25:10,840
Officer Shen,

542
00:25:10,900 --> 00:25:12,290
you're very observant.

543
00:25:17,550 --> 00:25:18,660
All I can say is

544
00:25:20,220 --> 00:25:21,210
Xiaodong

545
00:25:21,470 --> 00:25:22,630
is too ambitious.

546
00:25:23,420 --> 00:25:25,190
After studying abroad for a few years,

547
00:25:25,710 --> 00:25:27,110
he wanted to inherit my family business.

548
00:25:28,030 --> 00:25:29,110
I could only tell him

549
00:25:29,420 --> 00:25:30,350
that nothing

550
00:25:30,390 --> 00:25:31,310
is that easy.

551
00:25:32,110 --> 00:25:32,580
You see,

552
00:25:33,350 --> 00:25:34,710
Liu Yao's family

553
00:25:34,790 --> 00:25:36,070
has always been full of infighting.

554
00:25:37,230 --> 00:25:38,550
So I've come to realize

555
00:25:39,550 --> 00:25:41,190
that with kids, it's quality

556
00:25:41,910 --> 00:25:42,790
over quantity.

557
00:25:43,860 --> 00:25:44,630
That's why

558
00:25:45,240 --> 00:25:46,150
when I first met

559
00:25:46,190 --> 00:25:47,110
Du Cheng,

560
00:25:47,150 --> 00:25:48,100
I couldn't understand

561
00:25:48,410 --> 00:25:50,390
why he would refuse something

562
00:25:51,020 --> 00:25:52,570
others would fight tooth and nail for.

563
00:25:53,110 --> 00:25:54,140
Sooner or later,

564
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:56,300
he'll regret his naivety.

565
00:25:58,160 --> 00:25:59,430
I know Du Cheng quite well.

566
00:26:00,110 --> 00:26:01,070
On him,

567
00:26:01,410 --> 00:26:02,890
I indeed can't smell any

568
00:26:02,920 --> 00:26:03,900
worldly scent.

569
00:26:05,260 --> 00:26:06,540
It's just like how outsiders

570
00:26:07,310 --> 00:26:08,230
can't understand your pursuits either,

571
00:26:08,430 --> 00:26:09,110
right?

572
00:26:13,500 --> 00:26:14,780
Liu Yao is already dead.

573
00:26:16,190 --> 00:26:17,610
What I personally pursue

574
00:26:17,790 --> 00:26:19,120
is nobody else's business.

575
00:26:21,260 --> 00:26:21,790
By the way,

576
00:26:22,350 --> 00:26:23,680
how's your investigation going?

577
00:26:24,630 --> 00:26:25,790
This burglary,

578
00:26:25,810 --> 00:26:26,770
robbery, and murder...

579
00:26:27,030 --> 00:26:28,030
It's such a major case.

580
00:26:28,730 --> 00:26:29,510
The killer

581
00:26:29,530 --> 00:26:30,390
must receive

582
00:26:30,390 --> 00:26:31,310
the punishment they deserve.

583
00:26:34,470 --> 00:26:35,920
We will definitely catch the killer.

584
00:26:48,590 --> 00:26:49,110
How was it?

585
00:26:50,300 --> 00:26:51,310
I suspect Liu Yao's death

586
00:26:51,310 --> 00:26:52,040
is related to the child.

587
00:26:55,800 --> 00:26:56,950
Ji Jun is unconscious.

588
00:26:57,740 --> 00:26:58,510
He can't speak anymore.

589
00:26:59,780 --> 00:27:01,000
Li Han just sent a message,

590
00:27:01,110 --> 00:27:02,190
saying his wife brought a package

591
00:27:02,230 --> 00:27:02,790
to the police station.

592
00:27:03,090 --> 00:27:04,170
Let's go back and take a look.

593
00:27:23,910 --> 00:27:25,010
Officer.

594
00:27:25,990 --> 00:27:26,750
Officer.

595
00:27:26,840 --> 00:27:27,710
We were wrong.

596
00:27:27,780 --> 00:27:28,990
We truly know we were wrong.

597
00:27:29,100 --> 00:27:29,830
What are you doing?

598
00:27:29,850 --> 00:27:30,890
Let's talk this through.

599
00:27:31,030 --> 00:27:31,550
I...

600
00:27:33,030 --> 00:27:33,910
I-I found

601
00:27:33,990 --> 00:27:35,260
a note at home.

602
00:27:35,550 --> 00:27:37,020
It was left by Ji Jun.

603
00:27:37,830 --> 00:27:39,660
He said he left us money

604
00:27:39,770 --> 00:27:39,830
for us to live well

605
00:27:39,830 --> 00:27:41,220

00:27:41,270 --> 00:27:42,190
after he's gone.
(I buried some money under the tree of your parents' yard)

608
00:27:45,820 --> 00:27:47,240
The money is all here.

609
00:27:47,630 --> 00:27:48,660
We don't want it.

610
00:27:48,870 --> 00:27:49,960
We don't want a single cent.

611
00:27:50,030 --> 00:27:51,110
I'm just begging you.

612
00:27:51,150 --> 00:27:51,750
Could you please

613
00:27:51,750 --> 00:27:52,870
let him spend his last days

614
00:27:52,870 --> 00:27:53,670
more comfortably?

615
00:27:53,670 --> 00:27:54,870
Please get up and talk.

616
00:27:55,030 --> 00:27:55,770
Sit down first.

617
00:28:01,300 --> 00:28:02,990
Why is he so foolish?

618
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:14,290
Where did you get this gold bracelet?

619
00:28:19,330 --> 00:28:20,500
He gave it to me.

620
00:28:43,180 --> 00:28:44,210
When did he give it to you?

621
00:28:45,310 --> 00:28:46,930
About half a month ago.

622
00:28:48,910 --> 00:28:50,020
That day, he said

623
00:28:50,630 --> 00:28:52,670
he never bought me the traditional three gold jewelry pieces when we got married,

624
00:28:53,190 --> 00:28:54,750
so he gave me a bracelet first.

625
00:28:56,510 --> 00:28:57,550
In the next life,

626
00:28:58,430 --> 00:29:00,000
he'll give me a ring and a necklace.

627
00:29:09,030 --> 00:29:10,100
Did he steal this too?

628
00:29:13,480 --> 00:29:15,360
He might have been to Cao Jian's house before,

629
00:29:15,980 --> 00:29:17,600
but we need to investigate further.

630
00:29:24,150 --> 00:29:25,870
I checked Ji Jun's movements

631
00:29:25,870 --> 00:29:26,230
from half a month ago.

This gold chain

640
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:38,590
was given to his wife after Ji Jun returned

641
00:29:38,630 --> 00:29:39,470
from the hospital for treatment.

643
00:29:40,220 --> 00:29:41,610
I checked the surveillance footage of that day
(Beijiang Criminal Investigation Team)

644
00:29:41,700 --> 00:29:42,770
and found this video clip.

(Street 2)

647
00:29:54,630 --> 00:29:56,460
It looks like he's deliberately trying to hit someone with his car.

648
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:03,790
Why would he want to hit a pregnant woman?

649
00:30:05,240 --> 00:30:05,790
Captain Cheng,

650
00:30:07,090 --> 00:30:08,730
the pregnant woman is called Zhou Shanshan.

651
00:30:09,380 --> 00:30:10,110
She used to work

652
00:30:10,150 --> 00:30:11,310
at Cao Xiaodong's club.

653
00:30:11,870 --> 00:30:12,670
She was a PR specialist.

654
00:30:12,930 --> 00:30:14,350
Later, she got involved with Cao Xiaodong

655
00:30:14,380 --> 00:30:15,270
and resigned.

656
00:30:15,550 --> 00:30:17,070
Now, she's pregnant and waiting to give birth at home.

I feel this case

668

isn't that simple.

669
00:30:31,480 --> 00:30:32,350
Ji Jun is very likely

670
00:30:32,360 --> 00:30:33,090
to have been bought off.

671
00:30:33,920 --> 00:30:34,800
Who bought him off?

00:30:38,850 --> 00:30:39,840
How do you suggest we investigate?

00:30:44,530 --> 00:30:45,400
you and Li Han

676
00:30:45,400 --> 00:30:46,300
go talk to Zhou Shanshan.

677
00:30:48,090 --> 00:30:49,320
We'll go chat with Cao Xiaodong.

678
00:30:49,780 --> 00:30:50,240
Okay.

679
00:31:26,790 --> 00:31:27,490
Captain Cheng,

680
00:31:27,940 --> 00:31:29,430
there's a damaged statue here.

681
00:31:35,700 --> 00:31:37,310
It looks like a lion.

682
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:50,030
Officers.

683
00:31:52,270 --> 00:31:53,110
Please sit.

684
00:31:57,590 --> 00:32:00,110
Why did you

685
00:32:00,790 --> 00:32:01,910
come to see me?

686
00:32:03,430 --> 00:32:04,350
Zhou Shanshan.

687
00:32:05,990 --> 00:32:06,910
Is she your girlfriend?

688
00:32:08,750 --> 00:32:09,410
Yes.

689
00:32:10,500 --> 00:32:11,300
What's the matter?

690
00:32:11,910 --> 00:32:13,310
Did you know she was hit by a vehicle?

691
00:32:15,710 --> 00:32:16,310
I know.

692
00:32:18,350 --> 00:32:19,710
We'd like to ask you some questions.

693
00:32:19,750 --> 00:32:20,600
Did she have

694
00:32:20,820 --> 00:32:21,540
any enemies

695
00:32:21,540 --> 00:32:22,510
in her work or personal life?

696
00:32:30,870 --> 00:32:31,820
Not that I recall.

697
00:32:32,070 --> 00:32:32,870
What about you?

698
00:32:34,300 --> 00:32:35,470
Do you have any enemies?

699
00:32:38,790 --> 00:32:40,660
If I said it's my father,

700
00:32:41,510 --> 00:32:42,470
would you believe me?

701
00:32:47,230 --> 00:32:48,470
Why would he do that?

702
00:32:48,550 --> 00:32:50,180
It's all about money.

703
00:32:51,160 --> 00:32:52,750
He's worried that my mom and I

704
00:32:52,830 --> 00:32:53,860
will kick him out.

705
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:55,710
My child will also inherit part of the family fortune.

706
00:32:55,910 --> 00:32:56,670
So he hired someone

707
00:32:56,670 --> 00:32:57,790
to try to kill my child.

708
00:33:04,990 --> 00:33:06,150
I think he was the one

709
00:33:06,760 --> 00:33:08,230
who killed my mom.

710
00:33:15,110 --> 00:33:16,430
We need to investigate everyone here

711
00:33:16,430 --> 00:33:17,630
who knows Zhou Shanshan.

712
00:33:21,150 --> 00:33:22,690
Zhou Shanshan?

713
00:33:22,770 --> 00:33:23,870
When she first came,

714
00:33:23,870 --> 00:33:24,750
she seemed quite naive.

715
00:33:24,870 --> 00:33:25,870
She didn't even know how to avoid drinking.

716
00:33:25,900 --> 00:33:26,870
But who would've thought

717
00:33:26,910 --> 00:33:28,350
she was playing dumb to catch the big fish?

718
00:33:28,430 --> 00:33:29,740
When she finally made her move,

719
00:33:29,910 --> 00:33:31,590
she caught the king and queen in one go.

720
00:33:31,870 --> 00:33:32,510
Cao Xiaodong?

721
00:33:32,830 --> 00:33:33,630
No,

722
00:33:33,790 --> 00:33:35,310
the mom of Mr. Cao Jr.

723
00:33:36,130 --> 00:33:37,740
Zhou Shanshan is a graduate student.

724
00:33:38,070 --> 00:33:39,110
Surprising, isn't it?

725
00:33:40,260 --> 00:33:41,420
Liu Yao

726
00:33:42,070 --> 00:33:43,150
came here often?

727
00:33:43,390 --> 00:33:44,230
Yeah.

728
00:33:44,710 --> 00:33:46,690
Liu Yao particularly liked Zhou Shanshan.

729
00:33:47,020 --> 00:33:48,650
Every time she came here to accompany clients,

730
00:33:48,750 --> 00:33:50,270
she specifically requested Zhou Shanshan's company.

731
00:33:50,310 --> 00:33:51,750
I think this Zhou Shanshan

732
00:33:51,790 --> 00:33:53,490
was deliberately acting innocent.

733
00:33:53,590 --> 00:33:55,060
That high education really makes a difference.

734
00:33:55,870 --> 00:33:56,870
She can converse

735
00:33:56,910 --> 00:33:58,110
with rich people on the same level.

736
00:34:00,830 --> 00:34:01,850
You know what?

737
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:03,270
Zhou Shanshan's life

738
00:34:03,270 --> 00:34:04,590
isn't actually that great.

739
00:34:04,730 --> 00:34:06,780
Mr. Cao Jr. still acts the same as before,

740
00:34:06,990 --> 00:34:09,350
drinking and playing cards at the club every day,

741
00:34:09,389 --> 00:34:10,820
only going home at dawn.

742
00:34:11,030 --> 00:34:11,909
I don't think Mr. Cao Jr.

743
00:34:11,909 --> 00:34:13,190
really likes her.

744
00:34:14,310 --> 00:34:15,179
Officer,

745
00:34:15,320 --> 00:34:16,110
here's my business card.

746
00:34:16,310 --> 00:34:17,500
Here, take it, take it.

747
00:34:17,670 --> 00:34:18,550
When you come to make reservations in the future,

748
00:34:18,670 --> 00:34:19,429
remember to ask for me.

749
00:34:19,590 --> 00:34:20,880
I'll give you free drinks.

750
00:34:44,150 --> 00:34:44,810
Take care.

751
00:34:46,060 --> 00:34:46,860
You can go now.

752
00:34:48,989 --> 00:34:49,730
I'm from the Beijiang Branch Criminal Investigation Team.

753
00:34:49,730 --> 00:34:50,270
(Public Security)
I'm from the Beijiang Branch Criminal Investigation Team.

754
00:34:50,270 --> 00:34:50,290
(Public Security)

755
00:34:50,290 --> 00:34:51,219
I'm the sketch artist, Shen Yi.
(Public Security)

756
00:34:51,590 --> 00:34:52,190
Li Han.

757
00:34:53,110 --> 00:34:54,030
You can leave too.

758
00:34:54,389 --> 00:34:55,230
The police are here.

759
00:34:55,270 --> 00:34:55,989
What could happen?

760
00:34:56,150 --> 00:34:56,510
Okay.

761
00:34:59,670 --> 00:35:00,510
Sorry.

762
00:35:00,630 --> 00:35:02,390
After I was hit last time,

763
00:35:02,430 --> 00:35:04,030
Xiaodong assigned me a bodyguard

764
00:35:04,310 --> 00:35:04,990
who also serves as a driver

765
00:35:05,710 --> 00:35:06,920
to protect me and the child.

766
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:10,230
Regarding who might want to harm you,

767
00:35:10,510 --> 00:35:11,910
do you have any thoughts yourself?

768
00:35:13,790 --> 00:35:15,030
I really don't know.

769
00:35:15,910 --> 00:35:17,110
Have you offended anyone before?

770
00:35:17,580 --> 00:35:19,450
I used to work at the club.

771
00:35:19,910 --> 00:35:21,270
In our line of work,

772
00:35:21,390 --> 00:35:22,610
no one dares to offend the clients

773
00:35:22,990 --> 00:35:24,700
and no one respects us either.

774
00:35:25,110 --> 00:35:26,440
Even the biggest conflicts

775
00:35:26,550 --> 00:35:27,700
can be settled with a bottle of alcohol.

776
00:35:28,390 --> 00:35:29,150
After I quit,

777
00:35:29,150 --> 00:35:30,150
I've been living here,

778
00:35:30,470 --> 00:35:30,990
waiting to give birth.

779
00:35:32,350 --> 00:35:33,390
Who could I possibly offend?

780
00:35:34,570 --> 00:35:35,730
How's the baby doing?

781
00:35:36,350 --> 00:35:37,070
Quite well.

782
00:35:37,790 --> 00:35:38,630
It's been six months.

783
00:35:39,110 --> 00:35:39,670
It's a boy.

784
00:35:42,630 --> 00:35:43,430
So,

785
00:35:43,460 --> 00:35:45,340
how's your relationship with the other members of the Cao family?

786
00:35:49,060 --> 00:35:50,550
I'm aware of

787
00:35:50,580 --> 00:35:51,430
my position.

788
00:35:52,590 --> 00:35:53,430
As for me,

789
00:35:53,620 --> 00:35:55,350
I just want to use this child

790
00:35:56,880 --> 00:35:58,030
to earn myself

791
00:35:58,030 --> 00:35:58,910
some financial security.

792
00:35:59,790 --> 00:36:01,670
As long as the child is connected to the Cao family,

793
00:36:02,030 --> 00:36:02,630
that's enough.

794
00:36:05,270 --> 00:36:06,390
Did you paint those pictures?

795
00:36:07,710 --> 00:36:08,150
Yes.

796
00:36:09,070 --> 00:36:10,390
I learned it in an adult painting class.

797
00:36:13,270 --> 00:36:14,230
They're quite good.

798
00:36:15,030 --> 00:36:16,270
The composition is very stable

799
00:36:16,920 --> 00:36:18,360
and the colors are warm and bright.

800
00:36:19,010 --> 00:36:20,330
It's evident

801
00:36:21,110 --> 00:36:22,150
that you are indeed

802
00:36:22,150 --> 00:36:22,910
quite satisfied with your current situation.

803
00:36:23,390 --> 00:36:24,640
You can tell all that?

804
00:36:25,990 --> 00:36:26,630
That's right.

805
00:36:27,030 --> 00:36:28,100
Being hit

806
00:36:28,510 --> 00:36:29,780
might've been an accident.

807
00:36:30,290 --> 00:36:32,110
The Cao family treats me quite well.

808
00:36:32,590 --> 00:36:34,070
I really don't have anything to worry about.

809
00:36:36,670 --> 00:36:37,910
Your bracelet is quite unique.

810
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:41,150
Xiaodong's father gave it to me.

811
00:36:41,170 --> 00:36:42,270
It's worth over a hundred thousand yuan.

812
00:36:42,470 --> 00:36:43,350
Everyone in the family

813
00:36:43,390 --> 00:36:44,910
treats me well in this regard.

814
00:36:45,990 --> 00:36:46,990
Whatever I want,

815
00:36:46,990 --> 00:36:47,870
they buy it for me right away.

816
00:36:52,950 --> 00:36:54,090
(Public Security)

817
00:36:56,360 --> 00:36:56,600
(Beijiang City Public Security Bureau, Beijiang Branch)

818
00:36:56,600 --> 00:36:58,440
Liu Yao chose Zhou Shanshan
(Beijiang City Public Security Bureau, Beijiang Branch)

819
00:36:58,440 --> 00:36:59,590
Liu Yao chose Zhou Shanshan

820
00:36:59,620 --> 00:37:01,170
to bear a child for Cao Xiaodong.

821
00:37:01,600 --> 00:37:02,470
So Cao Xiaodong

822
00:37:02,470 --> 00:37:03,230
and Zhou Shanshan

823
00:37:03,230 --> 00:37:04,470
don't have an emotional foundation.

824
00:37:07,590 --> 00:37:09,350
Then why would Cao Xiaodong accept it?

825
00:37:15,790 --> 00:37:16,750
Does this look familiar to you?

826
00:37:17,910 --> 00:37:18,630
This...

827
00:37:20,910 --> 00:37:21,830
I've seen this in

828
00:37:21,830 --> 00:37:22,390
Cao Xiaodong's club.

829
00:37:24,540 --> 00:37:25,670
I saw many identical ones

830
00:37:26,760 --> 00:37:28,500
in Cao Jian's house.

831
00:37:31,990 --> 00:37:32,870
What could this represent?

832
00:37:34,110 --> 00:37:35,510
I think it's Liu Yao

833
00:37:35,560 --> 00:37:36,550
using her own way

834
00:37:36,590 --> 00:37:37,510
to assert her dominance.

835
00:37:40,030 --> 00:37:40,910
Did she put the one

836
00:37:40,910 --> 00:37:41,630
in Cao Xiaodong's club too?

837
00:37:42,590 --> 00:37:43,310
Probably.

838
00:37:44,830 --> 00:37:45,590
Look at this again.

839
00:37:47,790 --> 00:37:48,910
This is a lioness.

840
00:37:49,990 --> 00:37:51,670
Usually, a lion pride consists of

841
00:37:52,030 --> 00:37:53,450
one male lion

842
00:37:53,630 --> 00:37:55,390
and several lionesses.

843
00:37:56,670 --> 00:37:57,590
The lionesses occupy

844
00:37:57,590 --> 00:37:58,810
the absolutely dominant position.

845
00:37:59,230 --> 00:38:00,590
To maintain the entire pride,

846
00:38:01,310 --> 00:38:02,430
it's very likely to experience

847
00:38:02,500 --> 00:38:03,910
multiple successions of male lions.

848
00:38:04,540 --> 00:38:05,750
It could be the father before,

849
00:38:07,110 --> 00:38:08,470
and then possibly the son.

850
00:38:11,500 --> 00:38:12,230
Cao Xiaodong

851
00:38:12,230 --> 00:38:13,870
placed such a large sculpture

852
00:38:14,420 --> 00:38:15,830
in the center of the space,

853
00:38:16,550 --> 00:38:17,920
indicating that the meaning

854
00:38:17,920 --> 00:38:18,510
conveyed by this artwork

855
00:38:18,510 --> 00:38:19,550
was something he strongly identified with.

856
00:38:20,030 --> 00:38:22,320
But the lioness is beheaded now.

857
00:38:22,670 --> 00:38:23,830
The debris underneath

858
00:38:24,030 --> 00:38:25,550
suggests it was just recently smashed.

859
00:38:26,430 --> 00:38:27,160
So,

860
00:38:27,350 --> 00:38:28,230
I deduce that

861
00:38:28,870 --> 00:38:29,920
Cao Xiaodong's

862
00:38:30,390 --> 00:38:31,910
relationship with his mother, Liu Yao,

863
00:38:32,830 --> 00:38:33,830
had changed.

864
00:38:42,870 --> 00:38:44,050
Captain Cheng, Mr. Shen,

865
00:38:44,270 --> 00:38:45,350
I found out that Cao Jian

866
00:38:45,390 --> 00:38:47,320
invested in a gene company

867
00:38:47,460 --> 00:38:49,530
called Beijiang Kailai Biology.

868
00:38:49,670 --> 00:38:50,990
He took Zhou Shanshan there too,

869
00:38:51,430 --> 00:38:53,390
so I'm wondering if we should go and take a look.

870
00:38:53,420 --> 00:38:53,910
Alright.

871
00:38:53,990 --> 00:38:54,910
I'll go with Captain Cheng.

872
00:38:55,790 --> 00:38:56,380
Okay.

873
00:39:17,510 --> 00:39:18,190
Hello.

874
00:39:18,270 --> 00:39:19,110
I'm Tang Keying.

875
00:39:19,630 --> 00:39:20,830
Mr. Fang asked me to pick you up.

876
00:39:28,350 --> 00:39:29,160
This way.

877
00:39:34,470 --> 00:39:35,270
Mr. Fang,

878
00:39:35,750 --> 00:39:37,110
the guests from Beijiang Branch have arrived.

879
00:39:48,030 --> 00:39:49,270
I didn't expect it to be you.

880
00:39:51,510 --> 00:39:52,030
This is Du Cheng,

881
00:39:52,340 --> 00:39:52,910
my colleague.

882
00:39:55,030 --> 00:39:55,670
You know each other?

883
00:39:58,710 --> 00:39:59,270
Pleased to meet you.

884
00:40:02,880 --> 00:40:03,670
There's a case.

885
00:40:04,150 --> 00:40:04,710
We found out

886
00:40:04,710 --> 00:40:05,990
that Cao Jian brought Zhou Shanshan

887
00:40:06,070 --> 00:40:07,470
here for genetic testing.

888
00:40:08,310 --> 00:40:09,850
So we'd like to know

889
00:40:09,910 --> 00:40:10,790
the details about

890
00:40:10,790 --> 00:40:11,660
Zhou Shanshan

891
00:40:11,710 --> 00:40:12,470
and the Cao father and son.

892
00:40:13,390 --> 00:40:15,150
Cao Jian, Zhou Shanshan…

893
00:40:16,980 --> 00:40:18,180
They're a peculiar family.

894
00:40:21,110 --> 00:40:22,630
How do you feel about them?

895
00:40:24,910 --> 00:40:25,910
There are many totem symbols

896
00:40:26,760 --> 00:40:28,020
in Cao Jian's house.

897
00:40:29,430 --> 00:40:31,390
Desire is conveyed everywhere,

898
00:40:32,390 --> 00:40:34,110
but between these desires,

899
00:40:34,550 --> 00:40:35,830
there's a strong conflict,

900
00:40:36,910 --> 00:40:38,910
as if nurturing some kind of evil.

901
00:40:42,910 --> 00:40:44,070
We'd like to know

902
00:40:45,470 --> 00:40:46,860
what exactly Cao Jian brought Zhou Shanshan

903
00:40:47,150 --> 00:40:48,270
here to do.

904
00:40:51,090 --> 00:40:52,230
I'm very willing

905
00:40:52,310 --> 00:40:53,350
to cooperate with the police investigation.

906
00:40:54,190 --> 00:40:55,300
However, I'm sorry.

907
00:40:56,050 --> 00:40:57,150
Kailai Biology is a

908
00:40:57,150 --> 00:40:58,190
genetic research company.

909
00:40:58,510 --> 00:40:59,880
We have a very strict

910
00:40:59,990 --> 00:41:01,670
confidentiality agreement with our clients.

911
00:41:02,490 --> 00:41:03,640
We found out

912
00:41:04,550 --> 00:41:06,220
that Cao Jian is also your investor.

913
00:41:07,230 --> 00:41:08,330
From this angle,

914
00:41:08,790 --> 00:41:09,510
you have an obligation

915
00:41:09,510 --> 00:41:10,510
to cooperate with our investigation.

916
00:41:15,430 --> 00:41:16,750
That's a very good angle.

917
00:41:19,390 --> 00:41:20,910
But Shen Yi's feeling

918
00:41:21,700 --> 00:41:23,020
is already very close to the answer.

919
00:41:25,070 --> 00:41:26,670
You should follow your intuition

920
00:41:27,550 --> 00:41:28,510
and continue to dig deeper.

921
00:41:29,750 --> 00:41:30,830
Are you willing or not

922
00:41:30,830 --> 00:41:32,020
to cooperate with our investigation?

923
00:41:34,150 --> 00:41:34,670
Alright.

924
00:41:35,550 --> 00:41:36,270
I'll go check.

925
00:41:45,550 --> 00:41:47,310
Cao Jian has brought many women

926
00:41:47,350 --> 00:41:48,470
for genetic testing over time.

927
00:41:50,190 --> 00:41:51,430
Zhou Shanshan was the last one.

928
00:41:52,030 --> 00:41:53,070
Why did he bring so many people

929
00:41:53,070 --> 00:41:53,910
for genetic testing?

930
00:41:55,030 --> 00:41:57,270
To test if their genes are compatible.

931
00:41:58,990 --> 00:42:00,780
Because the Cao family has a very serious

932
00:42:00,830 --> 00:42:01,850
genetic defect.

933
00:42:02,070 --> 00:42:03,550
And it's highly hereditary.

934
00:42:03,970 --> 00:42:05,450
What kind of defect specifically?

935
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:07,250
The MAOA gene,

936
00:42:08,390 --> 00:42:09,550
also known as the warrior gene

937
00:42:09,570 --> 00:42:10,490
or the crime gene.

938
00:42:11,080 --> 00:42:12,300
Research shows

939
00:42:12,630 --> 00:42:13,670
that if the MAOA gene

940
00:42:13,670 --> 00:42:14,590
in a male's body

941
00:42:14,590 --> 00:42:15,590
mutates,

942
00:42:15,960 --> 00:42:17,350
it can lead to uncontrollable emotions,

943
00:42:18,190 --> 00:42:19,790
causing violent and aggressive behavior.

944
00:42:20,910 --> 00:42:22,910
They can be considered born criminals.

945
00:42:26,820 --> 00:42:29,630
The image of Fuxi and Nüwa symbolizes reproduction.

946
00:42:30,150 --> 00:42:31,110
You

947
00:42:32,230 --> 00:42:33,590
want another child?

948
00:42:34,910 --> 00:42:35,670
Officer Shen,

949
00:42:36,110 --> 00:42:37,510
you're very observant.

950
00:42:39,070 --> 00:42:39,750
So,

951
00:42:40,830 --> 00:42:42,910
who is it that wants to have a child

952
00:42:43,150 --> 00:42:43,910
with Zhou Shanshan?

953
00:42:44,990 --> 00:42:46,030
You can try

954
00:42:46,110 --> 00:42:47,510
to compare your feelings

955
00:42:47,590 --> 00:42:48,620
at their house

956
00:42:48,710 --> 00:42:49,550
with your speculations.

957
00:42:50,710 --> 00:42:52,070
You might find the answer.

958
00:42:55,750 --> 00:42:56,350
Officer Du,

959
00:42:57,830 --> 00:42:59,360
Shen Yi's unique perception

960
00:43:00,150 --> 00:43:01,470
is an artist's gift.

961
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:03,270
I believe the police profession

962
00:43:03,510 --> 00:43:04,270
restricts him.

963
00:43:07,030 --> 00:43:08,270
Too many rules,

964
00:43:08,430 --> 00:43:09,110
boundaries,

965
00:43:09,310 --> 00:43:09,990
and rationality

966
00:43:11,700 --> 00:43:13,000
will stifle his intuition

967
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:13,750
and imagination.

968
00:43:16,680 --> 00:43:17,670
We should advise him

969
00:43:17,670 --> 00:43:19,580
to reconsider his career choice.

970
00:43:20,480 --> 00:43:22,150
Thank you for cooperating with our investigation.

971
00:43:24,040 --> 00:43:24,590
Let's go.
